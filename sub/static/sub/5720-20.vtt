00:04.504 --> 00:06.293
<i>Previously on</i> Madam Secretary...

00:06.294 --> 00:08.077
HENRY: <i>I'm offering you a chance</i>

00:08.077 --> 00:09.183
to save your sister's life.

00:09.184 --> 00:11.602
Oh, my God. You, you are
asking me to be a spy.

00:11.603 --> 00:13.303
You know what they do
to spies in Russia?

00:13.813 --> 00:14.732
Please, get me out!

00:14.733 --> 00:15.982
HENRY: I'm taking care of it.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.142
Now, hang up the damn phone.

00:17.143 --> 00:19.192
There he is.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.313
Abort! Abort! Abort!

00:20.314 --> 00:21.432
What? No. What...?

00:21.433 --> 00:23.142
HENRY: Stop the van. Stop the van!

00:23.143 --> 00:24.432
Did you just give him up?

00:24.433 --> 00:25.812
Who's part of the negotiation?

00:25.813 --> 00:27.982
<i>Tell me where my brother is.</i>

00:27.983 --> 00:28.812
How do you sleep at night?

00:28.813 --> 00:30.036
HENRY: <i>Everything in my power.</i>

00:30.037 --> 00:30.873
How do you sleep...?

00:30.874 --> 00:31.993
(tires squealing)

00:33.313 --> 00:35.312
(laughter in distance)

00:35.313 --> 00:37.793
(indistinct chatter and laughter)

00:40.393 --> 00:42.352
ELIZABETH: Hey, good
morning, sleepyhead.

00:42.353 --> 00:43.438
Good morning, family.

00:43.439 --> 00:44.522
Morning, Dad.

00:44.523 --> 00:46.445
- I guess my alarm didn't go off.
- STEVIE: Yeah.

00:46.446 --> 00:48.192
My alarm sometimes does that, too.

00:48.193 --> 00:49.732
When I forget to set it.

00:49.733 --> 00:52.306
Uh, well, I guess that's possible.

00:52.307 --> 00:53.274
I was up kind of late.

00:53.275 --> 00:56.473
Yeah, followed by a fair
amount of tossing and turning.

00:56.474 --> 00:58.119
You see, that is why I never read

00:58.120 --> 01:00.079
classified documents before bed.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.789
All that catastrophic thinking

01:01.790 --> 01:03.213
kind of messes with the beta waves.

01:03.214 --> 01:05.289
So just to be safe,
you avoid thinking altogether?

01:05.290 --> 01:06.347
Glad you got up?

01:06.348 --> 01:08.289
Hey, aren't you supposed to
be on your way to New York?

01:08.290 --> 01:10.010
(muffled, indistinct):
Yeah... five minutes.

01:10.011 --> 01:11.354
ALISON: You're going to New York?

01:11.355 --> 01:12.709
Nobody tells me anything.

01:12.710 --> 01:15.039
I'm just going for the day.

01:15.040 --> 01:18.119
I'm giving a speech to
the UN General Assembly,

01:18.120 --> 01:21.579
asking them to formally
condemn Hizb al-Shahid.

01:21.580 --> 01:23.419
What's that going to do?

01:23.420 --> 01:27.749
Well, it's the diplomat's way
of saying to the school bully,

01:27.750 --> 01:30.079
"You know, everybody hates you."

01:30.080 --> 01:32.419
Your first speech to the UN, though.

01:32.420 --> 01:34.709
That's kind of cool. And historic.

01:34.710 --> 01:35.315
(clears throat)

01:35.316 --> 01:35.919
And...

01:35.920 --> 01:37.362
- tweetable.
- Yeah. Are you nervous?

01:37.363 --> 01:38.709
Well, I wasn't,

01:38.710 --> 01:40.919
so let's definitely
keep talking about it.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.789
Mm! Oh.

01:43.790 --> 01:46.209
Could you stop at the Hello
Kitty store in Times Square

01:46.210 --> 01:47.553
and get me this cute pencil case?

01:47.554 --> 01:48.709
It's an exclusive.

01:48.710 --> 01:50.119
Mom has a motorcade.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.879
She can't just stop by anywhere.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.329
Put it on your birthday list.

01:55.330 --> 01:56.960
Is Hello Kitty still in?

01:56.961 --> 01:57.916
Oh... (scoffs).

01:57.917 --> 02:00.379
Hello Kitty is the Chanel of our time.

02:00.380 --> 02:01.676
It'll never be out.

02:01.677 --> 02:03.804
That's just a little bit depressing.

02:03.805 --> 02:04.748
Oh, hey, wait a second.

02:04.749 --> 02:06.560
Before everybody scatters, listen:

02:06.561 --> 02:09.139
I got a call last night from
Mitch, and the horses

02:09.140 --> 02:12.430
are coming home from the winter
boarding stables this weekend.

02:12.431 --> 02:13.770
- Oh, cool.
- That's nice.

02:13.771 --> 02:15.180
I know. So I thought

02:15.181 --> 02:17.970
that maybe we could all go up on
Saturday and welcome them back.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.520
It would be like old times.

02:19.521 --> 02:21.730
We can ride a little bit,

02:21.731 --> 02:23.140
pop some popcorn.

02:23.141 --> 02:24.451
Cuddle by the fire.

02:27.101 --> 02:30.230
Okay, I realize I'm not Oprah
giving away free cars,

02:30.231 --> 02:31.774
but a little enthusiasm would be nice.

02:31.775 --> 02:34.230
It's just Jareth got us tickets

02:34.231 --> 02:36.100
to the symphony on Saturday night.

02:36.101 --> 02:37.964
And it's Molly's birthday
sleep-over. Remember?

02:37.965 --> 02:39.680
I just don't wanna.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.680
HENRY: Well, hey, I'm in.

02:41.681 --> 02:43.560
Riding, corn, cuddling, the whole deal.

02:43.561 --> 02:46.100
Romantic weekend it is,
just you and me.

02:46.101 --> 02:47.484
JASON: Oh, yeah, just you and Dad,

02:47.485 --> 02:50.060
and your true love... Buttercup.

02:50.061 --> 02:50.916
Aw.

02:50.917 --> 02:51.770
Oh, come on.

02:51.771 --> 02:53.434
- Not gonna fool me...
- STEVIE: Admit it.

02:53.435 --> 02:56.230
The only reason you want to go
up to the farm this weekend,

02:56.231 --> 02:58.020
is because Buttercup is coming home.

02:58.021 --> 02:59.140
What can I say?

02:59.141 --> 03:02.350
It's been a very long winter,
and I miss my horse.

03:02.351 --> 03:04.390
Buttercup. What a good boy.

03:04.391 --> 03:05.970
Buttercup has a clock in his head.

03:05.971 --> 03:08.520
He can do the course in perfect time.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.680
Don't forget how he
runs across the pasture

03:11.681 --> 03:12.810
whenever he sees me.

03:12.811 --> 03:14.234
JASON: He's an angel on this earth.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.180
STEVIE (laughs):
And he moves like a cat.

03:16.181 --> 03:18.100
The way he transitions into a canter,

03:18.101 --> 03:19.100
it's like... like...

03:19.101 --> 03:21.831
STEVIE & ALISON: Floating on air!

03:26.231 --> 03:27.951
(knocking on door, door opens)

03:29.731 --> 03:31.640
Dr. McCord.

03:31.641 --> 03:33.930
I did not realize you knew
where my office was.

03:33.931 --> 03:35.180
Yeah, I do.

03:35.181 --> 03:36.284
Uh, I need a favor, Oliver.

03:36.285 --> 03:37.890
Oh, I serve at the pleasure.

03:37.891 --> 03:39.474
Well, it's not Murphy Station business.

03:39.475 --> 03:40.640
It's about an old student.

03:40.641 --> 03:42.680
Uh, actually, his sister.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.970
Uh, I just want to check up on her.

03:44.971 --> 03:46.730
I do checkups. Name?

03:46.731 --> 03:47.970
Talia Petrov.

03:47.971 --> 03:50.270
P-E-T-R-O-V.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.031
M-O-U-S-E. (weak chuckle)

03:55.471 --> 03:56.730
Location?

03:56.731 --> 03:58.474
The last I heard, she
was leaving Stockholm,

03:58.475 --> 04:01.060
where she was in a drug
trial for fibrosarcoma.

04:01.061 --> 04:03.310
On her way back to Murom, Russia.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.600
I just want to make sure she's okay.

04:05.601 --> 04:06.930
Copy that.

04:06.931 --> 04:09.060
I will text you when I have a workup.

04:09.061 --> 04:10.911
Thank you.

04:13.181 --> 04:14.600
ELIZABETH: <i>The terrorist group</i>

04:14.601 --> 04:18.100
Hizb al-Shahid has only been
in existence for a short time,

04:18.101 --> 04:21.140
but it has already
perpetrated countless

04:21.141 --> 04:23.140
acts of of violence across the globe,

04:23.141 --> 04:25.060
including setting off

04:25.061 --> 04:27.430
a dirty bomb in Virginia.

04:27.431 --> 04:31.230
My family was at ground
zero during the attack,

04:31.231 --> 04:34.140
and because of that, I wondered
if I was the right person

04:34.141 --> 04:37.100
to stand here today
and ask for your help.

04:37.101 --> 04:40.100
Is it too personal?

04:40.101 --> 04:43.390
And then I realized, yes,

04:43.391 --> 04:45.350
it is personal to me,

04:45.351 --> 04:49.060
and to every single one of us.

04:49.061 --> 04:53.180
Because the principle at the
core of the United Nations

04:53.181 --> 04:57.430
is that all peoples, regardless
of race, color or creed,

04:57.431 --> 05:01.430
deserve to live lives of peace,

05:01.431 --> 05:05.140
free from the tyranny
of sudden violence.

05:05.141 --> 05:10.180
The challenge before us is enormous.

05:10.181 --> 05:12.470
But the struggle begins with words.

05:12.471 --> 05:17.100
That's why I'm here today
to ask for your solidarity

05:17.101 --> 05:20.310
and your resolve in
condemning this organization

05:20.311 --> 05:22.491
and everything it stands for.

05:23.971 --> 05:25.640
Shoulder to shoulder,

05:25.641 --> 05:28.520
we can bring the sponsors of terror

05:28.521 --> 05:32.890
to a swift and lasting justice.

05:32.891 --> 05:34.201
Thank you.

05:44.891 --> 05:46.970
(overlapping, indistinct conversations)

05:46.971 --> 05:48.600
Incredible speech ma'am.

05:48.601 --> 05:49.970
Thanks, Matt.

05:49.971 --> 05:51.350
Even with the changes.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.770
Yeah, sorry. I went a little
rogue there, for a minute.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.100
Hey, that's how we roll.

05:56.101 --> 05:58.180
A resolution condemning Hizb al-Shahid

05:58.181 --> 06:01.230
is certainly forthcoming, ma'am.

06:01.231 --> 06:02.890
DAISY: Go ahead. It's okay.

06:02.891 --> 06:03.890
Boom!

06:03.891 --> 06:05.230
(laughter)

06:05.231 --> 06:07.060
Yeah, boom.

06:07.061 --> 06:08.970
But the thing is,

06:08.971 --> 06:10.600
even if we've managed to convince

06:10.601 --> 06:14.100
the General Assembly to condemn HS,

06:14.101 --> 06:17.180
the move is largely symbolic.

06:17.181 --> 06:18.890
We need a call to action.

06:18.891 --> 06:20.890
NADINE: Do you have something in mind?

06:20.891 --> 06:23.060
ELIZABETH: A coalition.

06:23.061 --> 06:25.230
World powers coming
together with a common

06:25.231 --> 06:28.180
goal of ending HS, once and for all.

06:28.181 --> 06:30.100
I know, piece of cake.

06:30.101 --> 06:33.930
And that's why I'm
stalking Minister Avdonin.

06:33.931 --> 06:35.230
I'll be right back.

06:35.231 --> 06:37.770
That's the new
Russian Foreign Minister.

06:37.771 --> 06:39.560
I thought he'd have more hair.

06:39.561 --> 06:41.180
(speaking in Russian)

06:41.181 --> 06:42.180
Aha.

06:42.181 --> 06:43.600
Minister Avdonin.

06:43.601 --> 06:44.970
Madam Secretary.

06:44.971 --> 06:47.060
I was very impressed with your speech.

06:47.061 --> 06:49.560
And we're about to get
hit up for a late night.

06:49.561 --> 06:51.270
Want to bet?

06:51.271 --> 06:52.890
Sure.

06:52.891 --> 06:54.600
Both of our countries have suffered

06:54.601 --> 06:56.180
at the hands of Hizb al-Shahid.

06:56.181 --> 06:58.270
How about you and I get together

06:58.271 --> 07:00.730
and discuss a coalition?

07:00.731 --> 07:03.640
Y-you're on your way back to DC, right?

07:03.641 --> 07:05.060
Have you been checking up on me?

07:05.061 --> 07:08.850
I know that our offices
discussed a bilateral during

07:08.851 --> 07:10.430
the DC leg of your trip.

07:10.431 --> 07:13.180
Maybe you could come to my office

07:13.181 --> 07:15.270
first thing in the morning,
say, 7:00 a.m.?

07:15.271 --> 07:17.520
I was hoping that you and I

07:17.521 --> 07:20.230
might be able to rebuild
strong relations

07:20.231 --> 07:22.270
between our countries,
by coming together

07:22.271 --> 07:24.850
to confront our mutual enemy.

07:24.851 --> 07:28.270
I'll see you tomorrow... at 7:00 a.m.

07:28.271 --> 07:29.890
Excellent.

07:29.891 --> 07:31.121
Whew.

07:34.601 --> 07:36.451
It's gonna be a long night.

07:41.931 --> 07:44.166
JANE: We know you don't
want to go back to Libya.

07:44.167 --> 07:44.930
(interpreter speaking Arabic)

07:44.931 --> 07:46.930
You told us you want to
stay in the United States.

07:46.931 --> 07:49.100
JANE: But first you have to help us.

07:49.101 --> 07:50.390
We need information.

07:50.391 --> 07:51.390
About Jibral.

07:51.391 --> 07:53.100
(interpreter speaking Arabic)

07:53.101 --> 07:54.524
Do you know where he is, Hijriyyah?

07:54.525 --> 07:56.625
(interpreter speaking Arabic)

08:01.271 --> 08:02.661
(speaks Arabic)

08:07.061 --> 08:08.730
Two days, and not one word.

08:08.731 --> 08:10.390
I don't get it.

08:10.391 --> 08:12.230
When she agreed to
remain in our custody,

08:12.231 --> 08:14.251
I just assumed that meant
she would work with us.

08:15.601 --> 08:18.230
We rescued her from
Jibral freakin' Disah.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.230
Saved her life.

08:20.231 --> 08:24.970
Why isn't she singing like
a little freedom-loving bird?

08:24.971 --> 08:26.600
I tried everything,

08:26.601 --> 08:29.100
from direct confrontation,
to the Scharff Technique.

08:29.101 --> 08:31.730
It's like trying to engage a statue.

08:31.731 --> 08:33.140
She won't talk.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.059
U.S. Marshals say she's not eating.

08:35.061 --> 08:36.350
She's deeply traumatized.

08:36.351 --> 08:38.020
Oh, is that is, Dr.Freud?

08:38.020 --> 08:39.270
She grew up in a household

08:39.270 --> 08:40.850
with a brutal dictator for a father,

08:40.851 --> 08:42.559
who handed her off to
another violent man.

08:42.561 --> 08:44.520
We swoop in, in a hail of gunfire,

08:44.521 --> 08:46.384
grab her up and bring her
to a strange country,

08:46.385 --> 08:48.270
and start grilling her for information?

08:48.271 --> 08:49.814
You don't have to be a psychotherapist

08:49.815 --> 08:51.095
to figure out why she shut down.

08:51.096 --> 08:53.400
What if she's not working with
us because she's with them?

08:53.401 --> 08:54.560
Politically and emotionally.

08:54.561 --> 08:56.520
I doubt she has the sophistication

08:56.521 --> 08:58.161
- to run a game that deep.
- All the same,

08:58.162 --> 08:59.665
maybe it's time to start treating her

08:59.666 --> 09:00.930
like an enemy combatant,

09:00.931 --> 09:03.230
and less like our nation's
favorite houseguest.

09:03.231 --> 09:04.600
(phone rings)

09:04.601 --> 09:06.464
HENRY: You want to take
a terrified young woman

09:06.465 --> 09:08.520
to a black site for
enhanced interrogation.

09:08.521 --> 09:09.923
- Yeah, hello.
- That's a good idea.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.640
Whatever works, right?

09:11.641 --> 09:13.531
- Okay.
- 'Cause this approach does not.

09:15.891 --> 09:18.600
Guys, that decision might not
be ours to make anymore.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.230
Alex Jones from White House Counsel

09:20.231 --> 09:22.100
wants to see us right away.

09:22.101 --> 09:24.140
I don't think you understand
the dangerous position

09:24.141 --> 09:25.850
you've put the White House in.

09:25.851 --> 09:27.180
At your urgent request,

09:27.181 --> 09:29.430
President Dalton authorized Justice

09:29.431 --> 09:31.600
to issue an arrest warrant,

09:31.601 --> 09:34.680
so you could legally
rendition Hijriyyah Al Bouri.

09:34.681 --> 09:37.230
She's been in U.S.
custody for three days,

09:37.231 --> 09:39.470
and you haven't
registered her in the system.

09:39.471 --> 09:41.430
Only because we have good
reason to think that Jibral Disah

09:41.431 --> 09:43.140
believes that she
was killed in the raid.

09:43.141 --> 09:45.020
After we grabbed her,
we bombed the compound.

09:45.021 --> 09:47.404
JANE: If we file charges against
Hijriyyah in federal court,

09:47.405 --> 09:49.890
he'll know she's alive,
and he'll alter his plans.

09:49.891 --> 09:51.230
Then any information she gave us

09:51.231 --> 09:52.534
on his location will be useless.

09:52.535 --> 09:55.890
Plus, we can hold her under
the material witness statute.

09:55.891 --> 09:57.594
So if she's a witness,
and not a combatant,

09:57.595 --> 09:59.230
then file for political asylum.

09:59.231 --> 10:03.100
We're holding out asylum as an
inducement to get her talking.

10:03.101 --> 10:04.850
Is she talking?

10:04.851 --> 10:06.100
Not as of yet, no.

10:06.101 --> 10:07.180
(sighs)

10:07.181 --> 10:08.430
When you brought

10:08.431 --> 10:10.970
Hijriyyah Al Bouri onto U.S. soil,

10:10.971 --> 10:12.430
she was automatically granted

10:12.431 --> 10:14.180
certain rights:
The right to an attorney.

10:14.181 --> 10:17.230
The right to petition for
a writ of habeas corpus.

10:17.231 --> 10:18.730
The right...

10:18.731 --> 10:20.310
Have you even read her the Miranda?

10:20.311 --> 10:23.060
We've been trying to
keep things friendly.

10:23.061 --> 10:26.020
How friendly can things be when
you're holding her prisoner?

10:26.021 --> 10:28.680
She's not a prisoner;
she agreed to remain with us.

10:28.681 --> 10:30.464
Because she doesn't want
to go back to Libya.

10:30.465 --> 10:32.270
Okay, look.

10:32.271 --> 10:34.890
We need a few more days. The weekend.

10:34.891 --> 10:38.350
Hijriyyah holds the key
to finding Jibral Disah.

10:38.351 --> 10:40.180
If we miss this chance,

10:40.181 --> 10:42.701
it could be years
before we have another lead.

10:45.971 --> 10:48.911
The weekend.

10:51.271 --> 10:54.230
Monday morning, Hijriyyah Al Bouri

10:54.231 --> 10:56.770
goes into the system,
either as an enemy combatant,

10:56.771 --> 10:58.871
or a political refugee.

11:02.891 --> 11:05.350
Jones is right about one thing:

11:05.351 --> 11:07.430
Hijriyyah may have agreed
to stay in our custody,

11:07.431 --> 11:09.850
but she has no reason
to see us as friends.

11:09.851 --> 11:11.211
We're just strangers that took her

11:11.212 --> 11:12.675
from the only home she's ever known.

11:12.676 --> 11:14.430
Bleak and dangerous as that home was.

11:14.431 --> 11:16.520
Maybe she needs to see a familiar face.

11:16.521 --> 11:18.060
Someone who can give her hope

11:18.061 --> 11:19.890
for a better future.

11:19.891 --> 11:21.100
The teacher, Laila.

11:21.101 --> 11:23.140
We pushed her pretty
hard the last time.

11:23.141 --> 11:24.724
You think she'll want to help us again?

11:24.725 --> 11:26.890
Laila has a brother

11:26.891 --> 11:28.674
who's been trying to
come here for two years.

11:28.675 --> 11:30.310
He's got no affiliation

11:30.311 --> 11:32.270
with any radical group,
past or present.

11:32.271 --> 11:35.430
The guy is clean.

11:35.431 --> 11:36.430
Can we get State

11:36.431 --> 11:37.680
to expedite his visa

11:37.681 --> 11:39.060
in exchange for her cooperation?

11:39.061 --> 11:40.730
Okay, hold on. Does this really rise

11:40.731 --> 11:42.474
to the level of me
playing the husband card?

11:42.475 --> 11:43.640
Save it.

11:43.641 --> 11:45.184
I'll get approval from Russell Jackson

11:45.185 --> 11:46.765
and I'll meet you back at the office.

11:49.231 --> 11:53.350
So, I got a memo this morning
from Oliver Shaw's office.

11:53.351 --> 11:57.430
You asked him to run a
search on Talia Petrov.

11:57.431 --> 11:59.140
Everything Oliver does
for Murphy Station

11:59.141 --> 12:00.230
is run through ODNI.

12:00.231 --> 12:02.100
It's kind of a bureaucratic turf thing.

12:02.101 --> 12:05.140
I just wanted to check
and see if she was okay.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.100
(sighs) Look, Henry,

12:06.101 --> 12:08.140
she's been arrested
by the Russian police.

12:08.141 --> 12:09.520
What? When?

12:09.521 --> 12:11.270
Two weeks ago.

12:11.271 --> 12:12.270
Why didn't you tell me?

12:12.271 --> 12:14.430
Because given your history
with Dmitri Petrov,

12:14.431 --> 12:17.180
I had this crazy idea
you might react badly.

12:17.181 --> 12:18.684
Not if you're working to get her out.

12:18.685 --> 12:20.970
(scoffs, laughs) It's not that simple.

12:20.971 --> 12:22.411
Ever since Talia returned to Russia,

12:22.412 --> 12:23.795
she's been pressuring the military

12:23.796 --> 12:25.730
to turn over Dmitri's
remains for burial.

12:25.731 --> 12:27.020
Now, officially, she was told

12:27.021 --> 12:28.004
that he died of a fever,

12:28.005 --> 12:29.560
while serving at the front in Ukraine.

12:29.561 --> 12:31.430
When in reality,
he was most likely shot,

12:31.431 --> 12:33.390
or... tortured to death.

12:33.391 --> 12:34.680
Yeah.

12:34.681 --> 12:36.180
Dmitri's body is evidence

12:36.181 --> 12:38.430
his government
executed him as a traitor.

12:38.431 --> 12:41.350
They'll never give him back
to her and risk exposure.

12:41.351 --> 12:43.140
She was threatening to go public.

12:43.141 --> 12:44.390
They needed to do something

12:44.391 --> 12:45.770
to keep her quiet.

12:45.771 --> 12:47.770
Talia Petrov just got
out of the hospital.

12:47.771 --> 12:49.060
She's recovering from cancer.

12:49.061 --> 12:50.230
How long do you think she'll last

12:50.231 --> 12:51.100
if they put her in a work camp?

12:51.101 --> 12:52.310
Right now, they're holding her

12:52.311 --> 12:53.770
at a jail in the city.

12:53.771 --> 12:54.810
And we don't think they'll hold her

12:54.811 --> 12:55.970
for more than a few months.

12:55.971 --> 12:57.274
Just long enough to convince her

12:57.275 --> 12:58.140
to drop her request.

12:58.141 --> 12:59.390
Our best option here

12:59.391 --> 13:00.791
is to let events take their course.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.581
The last time I let
events take their course,

13:02.582 --> 13:04.310
Dmitri was captured and killed.

13:04.311 --> 13:05.430
That wasn't your fault.

13:05.431 --> 13:06.680
I recruited him.

13:06.681 --> 13:08.060
I promised him

13:08.061 --> 13:09.924
I would do everything
I could to keep him safe.

13:09.925 --> 13:13.430
And you did, but in the end,
it wasn't your call.

13:13.431 --> 13:15.060
The human cost

13:15.061 --> 13:16.680
is part of the
intelligence game, Henry.

13:16.681 --> 13:18.020
We can't save everyone.

13:18.021 --> 13:20.331
I know.

13:26.101 --> 13:27.470
HENRY: <i>Her name is Talia Petrov.</i>

13:27.471 --> 13:31.060
She's being held at a facility
near, uh, Leninsky Prospekt.

13:31.061 --> 13:33.270
Will you call me when you've seen her?

13:33.271 --> 13:34.890
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Brayshev.

13:34.891 --> 13:36.991
(knocking on door)

13:40.231 --> 13:42.730
Ugh! Here it is.

13:42.731 --> 13:44.930
I feel like I literally just got home,

13:44.931 --> 13:47.890
and now I'm turning around
to go right back out again.

13:47.891 --> 13:49.100
I hate it.

13:49.101 --> 13:51.020
That's why I never became a rock star.

13:51.021 --> 13:52.180
That and I can't sing.

13:52.181 --> 13:53.680
Rock stars sleep in.

13:53.681 --> 13:56.060
You're jumping out of bed at 4:00 a.m.

13:56.061 --> 13:57.310
to answer e-mails.

13:57.311 --> 13:59.060
My staff spent the night

13:59.061 --> 14:01.060
preparing a report for the new

14:01.061 --> 14:02.310
Russian Foreign Minister,

14:02.311 --> 14:04.140
and I had to give them notes before

14:04.141 --> 14:05.890
our meeting this morning.

14:05.891 --> 14:07.810
So you're back on the
Russian merry-go-round.

14:07.811 --> 14:10.890
Well, if you want to fight terror,

14:10.891 --> 14:12.810
you got to run with the big dogs.

14:12.811 --> 14:15.560
Ooh, which reminds me,

14:15.561 --> 14:18.230
um, we got the request
from Murphy Station

14:18.231 --> 14:22.230
for the expedited visa
for Laila Ayyad's brother.

14:22.231 --> 14:23.694
She agreed to help us with Hijriyyah

14:23.695 --> 14:25.171
if we could get him into the U.S.

14:25.172 --> 14:26.970
Well, it's in process.

14:26.971 --> 14:29.470
We forwarded it to Marc Forsythe

14:29.471 --> 14:31.680
at the Bureau of Consular Affairs.

14:31.681 --> 14:33.640
What does "in process" mean?

14:33.641 --> 14:36.060
Because we need it, like, today.

14:36.061 --> 14:40.020
Okay. I-I can talk to Marc.

14:40.021 --> 14:41.350
He's got a crush on me.

14:41.351 --> 14:43.140
I'm not above working that.

14:43.141 --> 14:44.470
Or, how about this?

14:44.471 --> 14:47.350
How about you deal with
your departmental issues,

14:47.351 --> 14:50.230
and, uh, clear up the backlog, and...

14:50.231 --> 14:51.350
get this thing approved.

14:51.351 --> 14:53.140
I'm on your side, remember?

14:53.141 --> 14:54.520
Well, it doesn't feel like it.

14:54.521 --> 14:57.060
It feels like I'm dealing
with a typical DC bureaucrat.

14:57.061 --> 14:58.101
Wait. Whoa!

14:58.102 --> 14:59.140
It is indefensible

14:59.141 --> 15:02.680
that this machine we both
serve comes to a grinding halt

15:02.681 --> 15:04.504
whenever something
actually needs to get done.

15:04.505 --> 15:06.430
And it feels like you're justifying it.

15:06.431 --> 15:08.230
What's this about?
What's going on, Henry.

15:08.231 --> 15:09.600
You-you tell me.

15:09.601 --> 15:11.730
Is it too much to ask
that once, just once,

15:11.731 --> 15:14.850
the most powerful country in the world

15:14.851 --> 15:17.281
wield that power to
actually help someone?

15:25.351 --> 15:28.201
I'm sorry. I... I got to go to work.

15:29.141 --> 15:30.430
Hey, Henry...

15:30.431 --> 15:32.331
I'll call you later.

Good morning, Madam Secretary.

15:51.861 --> 15:52.806
Morning, Nadine.

15:52.807 --> 15:53.966
How's everybody holding up?

15:53.967 --> 15:55.216
Maybe it's old school,

15:55.217 --> 15:56.676
but I think pulling an all-nighter

15:56.677 --> 15:58.556
every once in a while
is good for morale.

15:58.557 --> 15:59.926
Hmm.

15:59.927 --> 16:01.556
Here's the framework we put together

16:01.557 --> 16:03.346
for Minister Avdonin.

16:03.347 --> 16:06.596
That draft incorporates
all of your changes.

16:06.597 --> 16:09.056
Also, I retrieved Rifat Ayyad's

16:09.057 --> 16:11.256
expedited visa application

16:11.257 --> 16:13.256
and put it on your desk

16:13.257 --> 16:14.516
I let Murphy Station know

16:14.517 --> 16:17.556
that you would do that this morning.

16:17.557 --> 16:20.346
Was Marc annoyed
that we're bypassing him?

16:20.347 --> 16:23.426
No, actually he seemed kind of relieved

16:23.427 --> 16:25.256
that he had one less thing to do today.

16:25.257 --> 16:26.636
Right.

16:26.637 --> 16:30.466
Because he's a typical DC bureaucrat.

16:30.467 --> 16:31.466
Ma'am?

16:31.467 --> 16:32.806
Just processing out loud.

16:32.807 --> 16:34.139
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Hi.

16:34.140 --> 16:35.386
Uh, three things:

16:35.387 --> 16:36.886
Security just informed me that

16:36.887 --> 16:39.056
Minister Avdonin's
motorcade has arrived.

16:39.057 --> 16:40.640
Uh, your husband is
holding on line one.

16:40.641 --> 16:41.387
Oh... great.

16:41.388 --> 16:42.357
And...

16:44.427 --> 16:45.756
Hey.

16:45.757 --> 16:47.516
HENRY: Babe, I am so sorry.

16:47.517 --> 16:49.756
I just don't know what got into me.

16:49.757 --> 16:53.426
Besides lack of sleep,
hunting a terrorist,

16:53.427 --> 16:54.966
weight of the world on your shoulders.

16:54.967 --> 16:56.556
No excuse.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.016
I should never take it out on you.

Ever.

ELIZABETH: You're forgiven.
Listen, I, uh,

17:01.257 --> 17:05.175
I'm signing the paperwork

HENRY: You're amazing.

17:08.637 --> 17:10.806
Thank you.

17:10.807 --> 17:12.425
So...

17:12.426 --> 17:14.425
you're feeling better?

17:14.426 --> 17:15.806
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:15.807 --> 17:17.636
It's nothing a little austerity-budget,

17:17.637 --> 17:19.675
crappy White House coffee couldn't fix.

17:19.676 --> 17:23.096
Well, there's your problem right there.

17:23.097 --> 17:27.175
Conrad has a secret
espresso maker in the basement.

17:27.176 --> 17:28.716
You mean with the aliens?

17:28.717 --> 17:30.516

17:34.017 --> 17:35.216
Babe...

17:35.217 --> 17:36.527
Yeah?

17:40.017 --> 17:42.966
Thank your staff for me, okay?

17:42.967 --> 17:45.016
You bet.

17:45.017 --> 17:46.777
Okay. I love you. Bye.

17:52.717 --> 17:56.556
It, uh, feels like I'm
signing my life away.

17:56.557 --> 17:57.676
Well, all this really means

17:57.677 --> 18:00.636
is that you can't disclose
anything Hijriyyah says or does

18:00.637 --> 18:03.277
to anyone outside this room.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.016
What about my brother's visa?

18:06.017 --> 18:08.357
It's on its way over from the
State Department right now.

18:10.427 --> 18:12.447
Okay.

18:13.637 --> 18:14.697
When it comes...

18:15.637 --> 18:17.386
we can start.

18:17.387 --> 18:19.067
Of course.

18:22.137 --> 18:24.176
Anyone want some coffee?

18:24.177 --> 18:26.697
Yes, please.

18:34.057 --> 18:36.426
I'm sure your people
in Moscow will tell you

18:36.427 --> 18:38.516
that I hired a lawyer for Talia Petrov.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.806
Ooh.

18:40.807 --> 18:43.556
Did you know that, uh,
the State Department

18:43.557 --> 18:45.426
is starting negotiations with Russia

18:45.427 --> 18:47.516
to form a coalition to
fight Hizb al-Shahid?

18:47.517 --> 18:48.756
I'm aware.

18:48.757 --> 18:50.437
And your wife's all right
with you meddling

18:50.438 --> 18:51.687
in Russia's legal affairs?

18:51.688 --> 18:53.426
She doesn't know.

18:53.427 --> 18:56.527
I hired the lawyer before
I knew about her plan.

18:59.057 --> 19:00.516
Well, now you know,

19:00.517 --> 19:03.806
and these crossed wires could
potentially affect our work.

19:03.807 --> 19:05.777
We need everyone on the same page.

19:08.467 --> 19:09.926
KONSTANTIN: <i>This is very thorough.</i>

19:09.927 --> 19:13.466
My staff worked through the night.

19:13.467 --> 19:17.426
Hizb al-Shahid is a
scourge on this earth.

19:17.427 --> 19:19.096
I hope that we can find a way

19:19.097 --> 19:21.346
to come together and eradicate it

19:21.347 --> 19:22.617
once and for all.

19:24.467 --> 19:25.596
But...

19:25.597 --> 19:29.216
Before Russia can
commit to an alliance,

19:29.217 --> 19:31.386
we'll need a ten-year moratorium

19:31.387 --> 19:33.697
on all NATO expansion
into Eastern Europe.

19:35.057 --> 19:37.306
Well, that's... that's quite an ask.

19:37.307 --> 19:39.516
I disagree.

19:39.517 --> 19:42.466
NATO is, after all,
a group of nations formed

19:42.467 --> 19:45.716
to fight against perceived
Russian aggression.

19:45.717 --> 19:50.176
Such an organization
moving closer and closer

19:50.177 --> 19:53.216
to our western border,
is as great a threat

19:53.217 --> 19:54.886
as Hizb al-Shahid.

19:54.887 --> 19:59.346
NATO's founding principle is
based on an open door policy

19:59.347 --> 20:02.756
for any nation that meets the
requirements for membership.

20:02.757 --> 20:04.516
A moratorium is impossible.

20:04.517 --> 20:07.756
Admission must be unanimous.

20:07.757 --> 20:11.056
And the U.S. has veto power.

20:11.057 --> 20:14.346
All we ask is assurance
that you'll use it.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.567
For ten years.

20:17.927 --> 20:19.617
No, we-we won't do that.

20:21.557 --> 20:23.657
Then I'm afraid we're done here.

20:28.557 --> 20:31.426
You have a saying in this country.

20:31.427 --> 20:34.596
You showed your hand.

20:34.597 --> 20:36.596
It's clear to me that you want

20:36.597 --> 20:38.926
this coalition very much.

20:38.927 --> 20:41.966
So much that, eventually,

20:41.967 --> 20:44.466
you will give us what we want.

20:44.467 --> 20:49.426
President Salnikov and I
are prepared to be patient.

20:49.427 --> 20:50.777
Are you?

20:52.517 --> 20:55.277
Have a safe trip, Minister Avdonin.

21:02.217 --> 21:04.027
(door opens)

21:09.517 --> 21:10.516
(gently speaks Arabic)

21:10.517 --> 21:12.527
Laila asked her what's wrong.

21:13.967 --> 21:15.636
(speaking Arabic)

21:15.637 --> 21:17.180
JOSE: She says, "my life is hopeless."

21:17.181 --> 21:19.136
(continuing in Arabic)

21:19.137 --> 21:20.447
JOSE: "I can't breathe."

21:21.717 --> 21:24.176
She's starting to decompensate.

21:24.177 --> 21:28.096
Look, Disah kept her locked in
that house in Libya for months.

21:28.097 --> 21:29.926
We've had her inside this whole time,

21:29.927 --> 21:32.556
it's no wonder she feels
like she can't breathe.

21:32.557 --> 21:33.580
She needs some fresh air.

21:33.581 --> 21:35.426
We already brought over a playmate.

21:35.427 --> 21:36.913
Now you want to take
them both on a field trip?

21:36.914 --> 21:37.817
Just to the park.

21:37.818 --> 21:39.659
And yeah, if I thought
tickets to Taylor Swift,

21:39.683 --> 21:41.426
and a pony would get this girl talking,

21:41.427 --> 21:42.636
I would pitch that, too.

21:42.637 --> 21:43.966
Whatever works, right?

21:43.967 --> 21:46.487
I don't think it could hurt.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.676
ELIZABETH:
<i>We should do this more often.</i>

21:49.677 --> 21:51.466
Eat lunch?

21:51.467 --> 21:52.966
Together.

21:52.967 --> 21:54.386
Spontaneously.

21:54.387 --> 21:56.096
For no reason.

21:56.097 --> 21:58.676
Unless there's a reason.

21:58.677 --> 22:00.216
Hmm.

22:00.217 --> 22:03.466
If you're thinking you have
to make up for something...

22:03.467 --> 22:05.466
it's okay.

22:05.467 --> 22:07.487
Wh... this morning is over and done.

22:09.467 --> 22:11.056
Here's the thing:

22:11.057 --> 22:14.136
I wasn't 100% honest
with you on the phone.

22:14.137 --> 22:15.386
What do you mean?

22:15.387 --> 22:16.567
(clears throat)

22:17.967 --> 22:20.466
My mood this morning,

22:20.467 --> 22:23.386
it wasn't just about work.

22:23.387 --> 22:25.306
I've been having dreams. Nightmares.

22:25.307 --> 22:27.216
For a couple of weeks.

22:27.217 --> 22:28.426
What about?

22:28.427 --> 22:30.846
Dmitri.

22:30.847 --> 22:32.136
I'm sorry.

22:32.137 --> 22:33.346
And I found out yesterday

22:33.347 --> 22:35.527
that his sister Talia's been arrested.

22:37.517 --> 22:38.846
And you want to help her?

22:38.847 --> 22:39.722
Don't you?

22:39.723 --> 22:40.596
Of course.

22:40.597 --> 22:45.256
Under normal circumstances,
I'd do everything I could.

22:45.257 --> 22:47.756
It's just these
negotiations with Russia...

22:47.757 --> 22:50.886
it's all in a very fragile place.

22:50.887 --> 22:53.096
I guess I'm just afraid...

22:53.097 --> 22:54.386
You're afraid to rock the boat.

22:54.387 --> 22:57.136
Can you cut it out?

22:57.137 --> 22:59.556
God, it feels like you
don't know even know me.

22:59.557 --> 23:01.466
I'm sorry, but it's frustrating.

23:01.467 --> 23:04.176
You were there when
Hizb al-Shahid set off

23:04.177 --> 23:05.176
that dirty bomb.

23:05.177 --> 23:06.579
- Our children were there!
- I know!

23:06.580 --> 23:09.556
Well, HS still has nuclear
material in their possession.

23:09.557 --> 23:11.806
Stopping them has to
be our first priority.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.056
I get it, Elizabeth!

23:13.057 --> 23:14.657
Well, I... (sighs)

23:15.757 --> 23:17.317
I do.

23:19.807 --> 23:22.216
Once we have a deal in place,

23:22.217 --> 23:23.556
then we can focus

23:23.557 --> 23:26.596
on the Talia situation, I promise.

23:26.597 --> 23:27.617
But Henry, you and I...

23:27.618 --> 23:28.737
(knocking on door)

23:29.967 --> 23:31.567
Yeah?

23:32.467 --> 23:33.756
Dr. McCord?

23:33.757 --> 23:36.386
Jose Campos just called.

23:36.387 --> 23:38.516
He said to tell you
the field trip is a go.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.657
Thanks, Blake.

23:41.637 --> 23:42.987
Let me call you back.

23:45.717 --> 23:46.966
She said a word?

23:46.967 --> 23:48.516
Not yet.

23:48.517 --> 23:51.056
I'm this close to pulling the plug.

23:51.057 --> 23:54.817
Let's just give Laila
some space and time.

23:57.307 --> 23:59.407
(speaking Arabic)

25:01.967 --> 25:03.216
What is it?

25:03.217 --> 25:05.516
She's afraid of her father.

25:05.517 --> 25:07.117
Tell her we'll protect her.

25:10.347 --> 25:13.067
(speaking Arabic)

25:16.717 --> 25:18.817
(speaking Arabic)

25:24.097 --> 25:29.386
She says if you want
her help to kill Jibral,

25:29.387 --> 25:32.697
you must kill her father first.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.623
Okay, that sounds good.

25:43.624 --> 25:46.407
We can meet you and the vet
there on Saturday morning.

25:46.408 --> 25:48.228
Thanks.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.420
Everything okay?

25:49.421 --> 25:50.851
Well, I'm not sure.

25:52.131 --> 25:54.011
Mitch went to the winter stables

25:54.012 --> 25:55.460
to ready the horses for transport

25:55.461 --> 25:57.010
and Buttercup was limping.

25:57.011 --> 25:58.300
A sprain?

25:58.301 --> 25:59.550
Probably.

25:59.551 --> 26:01.630
Anyway, I won't be
riding him this weekend.

26:01.631 --> 26:04.210
That's okay. You two can just cuddle.

26:04.211 --> 26:06.750
So can we.

26:06.751 --> 26:08.731
You look like you could
use some downtime.

26:09.671 --> 26:12.460
Busy day.

26:12.461 --> 26:14.880
I was thinking that maybe you want

26:14.881 --> 26:17.250
to talk to somebody about those dreams.

26:17.251 --> 26:20.510
I've read, like, tons
of articles on <i>Slate...</i>

26:20.511 --> 26:21.510
(chuckles)

26:21.511 --> 26:23.750
...about it, and, well,

26:23.751 --> 26:26.800
declared myself fully qualified.

26:26.801 --> 26:30.840
I'm convinced of your expertise,
but no, thanks.

26:30.841 --> 26:32.651
Well...

26:33.711 --> 26:39.595
Um, Russell Jackson read me
in on Hijriyyah Al Bouri.

26:40.011 --> 26:42.510
Greek drama of the
patricidal demand aside,

26:42.511 --> 26:44.550
I give her credit for picking

26:44.551 --> 26:45.590
a worthy target.

26:45.591 --> 26:46.710
Yeah, worthy, but elusive.

26:46.711 --> 26:49.300
We spent four hours in
meetings with Intelligence.

26:49.301 --> 26:51.590
The bottom line is, if we knew
where Idris Al Bouri was,

26:51.591 --> 26:53.050
our military would have
already taken him out.

26:53.051 --> 26:54.434
Doesn't Hijriyyah have information

26:54.435 --> 26:55.880
that could help us track him down?

26:55.881 --> 26:56.625
(phone ringing)

26:56.626 --> 26:58.763
All she knows is that he
funds his illegal activities

26:58.764 --> 27:01.670
by trading in black market oil.

27:01.671 --> 27:03.090
I've gotta take this.

27:03.091 --> 27:03.696
Fine.

27:03.697 --> 27:04.401
Sorry.

27:05.631 --> 27:06.630
Hello.

27:06.631 --> 27:08.510
PHIL: Dr. McCord? Talia Petrov

27:08.511 --> 27:10.630
flatly rejected the offer of counsel.

27:10.631 --> 27:12.170
Did she say why?

27:12.171 --> 27:13.340
In all candor,

27:13.341 --> 27:14.644
once she learned you were paying

27:14.645 --> 27:16.300
for our services,

27:16.301 --> 27:18.731
she said she would prefer
a Russian public defender.

27:20.251 --> 27:21.590
But I feel I should tell you,

27:21.591 --> 27:24.460
my colleague was
concerned for her health.

27:24.461 --> 27:26.731
He said she seemed very weak.

27:28.301 --> 27:30.510
Do I have any other options?

27:30.511 --> 27:32.014
There's only one that I can think of,

27:32.015 --> 27:33.201
and it's a long shot.

27:33.202 --> 27:35.170
But it might be your only chance

27:35.171 --> 27:37.271
to get Talia Petrov out of jail.

27:38.711 --> 27:40.231
I'm listening.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.630
ELIZABETH: <i>Ephraim, thank
you for fitting me in.</i>

27:44.631 --> 27:46.550
I wish I had more than a few minutes,

27:46.551 --> 27:48.010
but I'm meeting with the President's

27:48.011 --> 27:50.460
Intelligence Advisory Board at 9:00.

27:50.461 --> 27:52.460
No worries. I mean, I'm just wondering,

27:52.461 --> 27:54.460
where are we on Idris Al Bouri?

27:54.461 --> 27:56.090
Unfortunately, we know very little

27:56.091 --> 27:57.590
about his latest operation.

27:57.591 --> 27:58.734
Well, his daughter Hijjriyah

27:58.735 --> 28:00.590
said that he deals in black market oil.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.460
Any intel on who his clients are?

28:02.461 --> 28:04.250
The usual suspects.

28:04.251 --> 28:05.880
Paramilitary groups, drug cartels,

28:05.881 --> 28:07.271
the Russian Mafia.

28:08.711 --> 28:10.750
I can get you the file.

28:10.751 --> 28:13.010
That would be great. Thanks.

28:13.011 --> 28:14.561
Hope it helps.

28:18.461 --> 28:19.561
(elevator bell dings)

28:22.801 --> 28:24.460
KONSTANTIN: <i>Madam Secretary.</i>

28:24.461 --> 28:27.250
<i>Can I assume you have good news for me?</i>

28:27.251 --> 28:28.630
ELIZABETH: <i>President Dalton</i>

28:28.631 --> 28:31.420
has agreed to add a secret provision

28:31.421 --> 28:34.010
to our coalition deal.

28:34.011 --> 28:38.250
The U.S. will veto any new
Eastern European nation

28:38.251 --> 28:40.340
that attempts to join NATO
for the next five years.

28:40.341 --> 28:42.340
We asked for ten.

28:42.341 --> 28:43.420
You're getting five.

28:43.421 --> 28:44.811
And there's one other thing:

28:47.091 --> 28:49.420
This is Idris Al Bouri.

28:49.421 --> 28:51.380
A terrorist. A criminal.

28:51.381 --> 28:54.510
And a high-priority target
for the United States.

28:54.511 --> 28:56.510
He recently pledged his loyalty

28:56.511 --> 28:58.250
to Hizb al-Shahid.

28:58.251 --> 29:00.750
When our deal is concluded,
you would like this man

29:00.751 --> 29:03.050
to be the first target.

29:03.051 --> 29:06.250
Actually, my government has learned

29:06.251 --> 29:09.420
that Al Bouri openly
conducts business in Russia,

29:09.421 --> 29:12.210
selling black market oil to the Bratva.

29:12.211 --> 29:15.010
Of course, your government

29:15.011 --> 29:19.960
has no direct links to organized crime.

29:19.961 --> 29:22.920
But if your intelligence agencies

29:22.921 --> 29:25.840
were keeping tabs on the local mafia,

29:25.841 --> 29:27.590
and they, in turn,

29:27.591 --> 29:30.090
happened to know of Al
Bouri's whereabouts,

29:30.091 --> 29:33.960
well... we'd like to be
read in on that information.

29:33.961 --> 29:35.611
Today.

29:37.881 --> 29:39.880
And if I say no?

29:39.881 --> 29:43.710
Then, I leave here and
we don't have a deal.

29:43.711 --> 29:47.510
And then, maybe this afternoon,

29:47.511 --> 29:51.510
I'll reach out to certain
Eastern European countries

29:51.511 --> 29:54.300
with NATO Membership Action
Plans already in place,

29:54.301 --> 29:55.670
and then maybe we'll talk about

29:55.671 --> 29:59.611
how to facilitate their approval.

30:01.631 --> 30:05.880
Konstantin, if I showed
you my hand yesterday,

30:05.881 --> 30:08.050
then you showed me yours, as well.

30:08.051 --> 30:13.420
How much do you want our veto
power working on your behalf?

30:13.421 --> 30:18.550
I think you want it as much
as I want this coalition,

30:18.551 --> 30:21.170
and Idris Al Bouri's location.

30:21.171 --> 30:23.271
(sighs)

30:26.301 --> 30:27.611
Okay.

30:30.171 --> 30:34.210
I will call President Salnikov,

30:34.211 --> 30:36.590
and get back to you
as soon as possible.

30:36.591 --> 30:38.238
Great.

30:54.365 --> 30:56.784
ELIZABETH: <i>President Salnikov
has agreed to the deal,</i>

30:56.785 --> 31:00.784
<i>and our intelligence agencies
are coordinating now.</i>

31:00.785 --> 31:02.704
<i>Thank you, Mr. President.</i>

31:02.705 --> 31:05.114
Okay, great.

31:05.115 --> 31:08.534
Since, in practice, Hijriyyah
has agreed to work with us,

31:08.535 --> 31:10.034
White House Counsel will prepare

31:10.035 --> 31:11.994
a classified request for her asylum.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.824
Good. Now we just have to hope

31:13.825 --> 31:15.408
that Russia comes through on their end.

31:15.409 --> 31:17.824
Well, for the moment,
it's out of our hands.

31:17.825 --> 31:19.545
I haven't forgotten
about Talia, by the way.

31:19.546 --> 31:21.169
When things settle down,
I'll take action

31:21.170 --> 31:23.784
on getting her released, okay?

31:23.785 --> 31:24.954
Hey, Mitch!

31:24.955 --> 31:26.364
Elizabeth.

31:26.365 --> 31:27.732
ELIZABETH: Oh, that's Sue!
Thank you for coming.

31:27.733 --> 31:29.744
- Elizabeth.
- HENRY: Mitch, how are you?

31:29.745 --> 31:31.704
That's my boy.

31:31.705 --> 31:33.825
- Ah... gosh, gosh...
- HENRY: So, do we know what's wrong?

31:33.826 --> 31:35.169
DR. KLEIN: Oh, it's hard to tell.

31:35.170 --> 31:37.154
Definitely favoring
his right leg, though.

31:37.155 --> 31:38.994
And he seems in some distress.

31:38.995 --> 31:40.114
I know. I know.

31:40.115 --> 31:41.418
I would like to run a few tests.

31:41.419 --> 31:42.966
Maybe even an MRI.

31:42.967 --> 31:45.744
I have to warn you, though,
it could get expensive.

31:45.745 --> 31:47.284
Oh, he's family. Do whatever you need.

31:47.285 --> 31:49.534
ELIZABETH: I know, I know.

31:49.535 --> 31:50.784
Hi, my big boy.

31:50.785 --> 31:52.074
Oh, she's back. Are you happy?

31:52.075 --> 31:53.324
(laughs)

31:53.325 --> 31:55.114
I'm happy. Yes.

31:55.115 --> 31:57.284
I got dinner.

31:57.285 --> 32:00.284
See, I love this.

32:00.285 --> 32:04.244
All the ingredients you need
for a gourmet meal in a box.

32:04.245 --> 32:06.204
If this had been around
when the kids were small,

32:06.205 --> 32:09.154
I would have cooked something like...

32:09.155 --> 32:12.954
"Apple Cider Chicken Breasts
with Sautéed Mustard Greens

32:12.955 --> 32:14.954
and Sweet Potato Hash"

32:14.955 --> 32:16.574
every night.

32:16.575 --> 32:18.034
Uh-huh.

32:18.035 --> 32:19.154
Definitely every Saturday.

32:19.155 --> 32:20.324
Yeah.

32:20.325 --> 32:22.114
Oh, shut up.

32:22.115 --> 32:26.114
I am really glad that
we got away this weekend

32:26.115 --> 32:28.755
without the kids.

32:30.415 --> 32:35.244
The <i>kids</i> being two
teens and a grown-up.

32:35.245 --> 32:39.154
I think weekends alone
together is our new norm.

32:39.155 --> 32:41.574
Good thing we like each other.

32:41.575 --> 32:44.154
Assuming, of course, we still do.

32:44.155 --> 32:45.204
Uh, double thumbs up,

32:45.205 --> 32:46.015
(phone buzzing)

32:46.016 --> 32:46.824
horns and confetti,

32:46.825 --> 32:49.414
and various smiley faces.

32:49.415 --> 32:53.255
I love it when you speak emoji.

32:55.205 --> 32:56.454
Hello.

32:56.455 --> 32:58.398
DAISY: Sorry to bother you
on the weekend, ma'am.

32:58.399 --> 32:59.654
Hey, Daisy, what's up?

32:59.655 --> 33:02.494
I just got a call from
Amnesty International.

33:02.495 --> 33:03.784
What about?

33:03.785 --> 33:05.204
They prepared a public statement

33:05.205 --> 33:07.034
and they wanted to give
you a courtesy notice

33:07.035 --> 33:08.284
of its impending release.

33:08.285 --> 33:10.034
Wait. I don't understand.

33:10.035 --> 33:12.494
Why is Amnesty International
checking in with me?

33:12.495 --> 33:13.914
Because they're denouncing

33:13.915 --> 33:15.534
the wrongful arrest of a Russian woman

33:15.535 --> 33:17.914
named Talia Petrov.

33:17.915 --> 33:20.864
And they got the tip from...

33:20.865 --> 33:23.885
Dr. Henry McCord.

33:29.955 --> 33:31.595
Tell them to hold off.

33:33.245 --> 33:38.215
No, uh, ask them if they'll
tear up the statement.

33:39.825 --> 33:41.805
Thanks for calling.

33:44.415 --> 33:46.074
You lied to me.

33:46.075 --> 33:48.154
I didn't lie.

33:48.155 --> 33:49.654
You withheld information.

33:49.655 --> 33:51.364
Don't start parsing terms with me.

33:51.365 --> 33:52.615
Talia Petrov is sick.

33:52.616 --> 33:53.864
(door closes)

33:53.865 --> 33:56.114
I was worried that if I waited
until you became friends

33:56.115 --> 33:57.784
with the Russians again, she'd be dead.

33:57.785 --> 33:59.494
Henry, we're not sharing slam books.

33:59.495 --> 34:00.994
We're trying to negotiate something

34:00.995 --> 34:02.534
that will make the world safer.

34:02.535 --> 34:04.534
Yeah, there are
delicate systems at play.

34:04.535 --> 34:05.994
It's a crucial moment.

34:05.995 --> 34:08.178
You're just going to tell me
that it's not a good time.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.324
But it's never a good time.

34:09.324 --> 34:11.824
And you're just going to... what,

34:11.824 --> 34:14.494
a-a-accuse me of siding
with politicians?

34:14.495 --> 34:16.244
We're on the same team.

34:16.245 --> 34:19.114
We're-we're both in public service.

34:19.114 --> 34:24.284
What sense does it make if
we can't believe in the system

34:24.284 --> 34:25.199
we're sworn to uphold?

34:25.201 --> 34:26.114
I don't know.

34:26.114 --> 34:27.654
What sense does it make?

34:27.655 --> 34:29.094
Well, hear me on this:

34:30.034 --> 34:31.614
If the Russians find out

34:31.614 --> 34:33.994
that we've been meddling
in their affairs,

34:33.995 --> 34:36.324
they could pull out
of the coalition talks.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.704
Which means we have no
partner in this fight.

34:38.705 --> 34:41.324
No, no finding Idris Al Bouri.

34:41.324 --> 34:43.494
No intel on Jibral Disah.

34:43.495 --> 34:45.534
Hijriyyah goes back to Libya.

34:45.534 --> 34:48.954
Are you willing to risk
everything we're working for...

34:48.955 --> 34:50.574
just to save one person?

34:50.574 --> 34:53.154
That's just what we said
when it was Dmitri.

34:53.155 --> 34:55.414
One life ended, yeah.

34:55.415 --> 34:56.704
And thousands saved.

34:56.705 --> 34:57.954
A million.

34:57.955 --> 34:59.204
And I said it, too.

34:59.205 --> 35:00.324
I believed it.

35:00.325 --> 35:01.574
I believe you.

35:01.575 --> 35:03.414
I think you did the right thing.

35:03.415 --> 35:04.824
You made the right choice.

35:04.825 --> 35:08.034
Th-th... here's the thing:

35:08.035 --> 35:12.385
I just can't live with it.

35:15.035 --> 35:19.204
There's this humming
in the back of my brain.

35:19.205 --> 35:22.534
It's this constant feeling
that I made a terrible mistake

35:22.535 --> 35:24.204
and it's too late to fix it.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.154
What mistake?

35:25.155 --> 35:27.614
I stayed in the van!

35:27.615 --> 35:30.114
I let them drive away
and leave Dmitri there.

35:30.115 --> 35:32.454
What else could you have done?

35:32.455 --> 35:34.864
I don't know. I could've... (sighs)

35:34.865 --> 35:36.414
...fought harder; made them stop.

35:36.415 --> 35:38.244
What chance would you have had

35:38.245 --> 35:39.994
against the other
operatives in that van?

35:39.995 --> 35:41.818
They-they would have
physically restrained you

35:41.819 --> 35:44.114
before letting you hijack their orders.

35:44.115 --> 35:48.175
Which, remember, came
directly from the president.

35:49.155 --> 35:54.284
Dmitri made a choice
to spy for this country.

35:54.285 --> 35:57.204
He must have felt it was worth it.

35:57.205 --> 35:58.954
(laughing)

35:58.955 --> 36:01.204
You make it sound so honorable.

36:01.205 --> 36:04.324
He was a terrified kid
who didn't want to die.

36:04.325 --> 36:07.204
And Talia Petrov is an innocent.

36:07.205 --> 36:09.864
The victim of everything we've done.

36:09.865 --> 36:11.534
I am not going to leave
her there to die, too.

36:11.535 --> 36:12.998
You didn't have to be alone in this.

36:12.999 --> 36:14.284
You-you could have talked to me.

36:14.285 --> 36:16.675
I can't talk to you!

36:20.995 --> 36:22.284
(gasping)

36:22.285 --> 36:25.284
You're all...

36:25.285 --> 36:27.034
tied up...

36:27.035 --> 36:28.704
with this in my head.

36:28.705 --> 36:30.284
Sometimes when I see you,

36:30.285 --> 36:32.454
it's like I-I'm going right back there.

36:32.455 --> 36:34.925
I know you want to help, but you can't.

36:36.785 --> 36:40.902
Because you remind me of how I failed.

37:31.927 --> 37:33.027
You're up early.

37:33.967 --> 37:36.067
Couldn't sleep.

37:43.377 --> 37:44.756
(cell phone buzzes)

37:44.757 --> 37:47.926
(second cell phone ringing)

37:47.927 --> 37:50.727
(land line phone rings)

37:53.087 --> 37:55.466
Officials say the U.S.
drone strike near Sirte,

37:55.467 --> 37:58.336
on the Libyan coastline,
killed six militants,

37:58.337 --> 38:00.966
including Idris Al Bouri.

38:00.967 --> 38:04.006
During the 1980s, Al Bouri
was a high-ranking member

38:04.007 --> 38:06.376
of the mujahideen in Afghanistan,

38:06.377 --> 38:08.756
and most recently pledged his loyalty

38:08.757 --> 38:11.466
to the terrorist group Hizb al-Shahid.

38:11.467 --> 38:13.046
In related news,

38:13.047 --> 38:14.876
Russia has announced that it is set

38:14.877 --> 38:16.940
to begin preliminary talks
with the United States...

38:16.941 --> 38:18.046
(phone ringing)

38:18.047 --> 38:19.876
...with an eye toward
forming a coalition...

38:19.877 --> 38:22.006
(turns off TV)

38:22.007 --> 38:23.716
Hello.

38:23.717 --> 38:24.756
Okay, thanks.

38:24.757 --> 38:26.437
Vet's here.

38:28.927 --> 38:32.126
The issue with Buttercup's
leg isn't a sprain.

38:32.127 --> 38:33.506
It's a tumor.

38:33.507 --> 38:37.626
The MRI showed he's suffering
from lymphosarcoma.

38:37.627 --> 38:38.876
How bad?

38:38.877 --> 38:40.796
It's very advanced.

38:40.797 --> 38:42.796
And there are other tumors,

38:42.797 --> 38:46.086
and it's metastasized into his liver.

38:46.087 --> 38:48.227
Are you saying that it's terminal?

38:52.217 --> 38:54.411
- What about chemo?
- Shh...

38:54.412 --> 38:56.355
I mean, there's got to
be some kind of treatment.

38:56.356 --> 38:57.086
The thing is,

38:57.087 --> 38:59.817
I'm afraid he's in pain.

39:00.757 --> 39:02.506
We can't have that.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.397
No, we can't have that.

39:07.127 --> 39:09.506
When do we need to do this?

39:09.507 --> 39:10.850
DR. KLEIN: Whenever you're ready.

39:10.851 --> 39:12.756
Is there really no other choice?

39:12.757 --> 39:14.666
As difficult as it is,

39:14.667 --> 39:17.836
I think Elizabeth is
making the best decision.

39:17.837 --> 39:21.336
I'd like to have the day with him.

39:21.337 --> 39:22.666
Say good-bye.

39:22.667 --> 39:24.716
That is, if you can give him
something for the pain.

39:24.717 --> 39:26.126
DR. KLEIN: Sure.

39:26.127 --> 39:28.227
I'll give him a shot of Butorphanol.

39:28.927 --> 39:31.727
And, uh, I can come back this evening.

39:33.757 --> 39:36.506
(phone blips)

39:36.507 --> 39:38.466
Is it work?

39:38.467 --> 39:40.107
Uh, yeah.

39:41.047 --> 39:42.466
It's all right.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.126
You can go if you have to.

39:44.127 --> 39:46.227
It's nothing I can't put off.

39:47.087 --> 39:49.006
I'm fine. Really, I promise.

39:49.007 --> 39:50.126
You sure?

39:50.127 --> 39:51.470
You don't want the kids with you?

39:51.471 --> 39:52.216
No.

39:52.217 --> 39:54.006
Then we're all here and we're upset,

39:54.007 --> 39:57.187
he'll know something's wrong.

40:26.587 --> 40:28.147
(sobs quietly)

40:29.217 --> 40:31.317
(crying)

40:34.927 --> 40:38.006
(speaking Arabic)

40:38.007 --> 40:40.590
JOSE: She's saying, "I thought he
was stronger than their bombs."

40:40.591 --> 40:41.966
(continuing in Arabic)

40:41.967 --> 40:44.107
"Stronger than Allah."

40:48.217 --> 40:50.086
(speaking Arabic)

40:50.087 --> 40:51.857
"And now I'm free."

40:59.257 --> 41:00.756
JOSE: <i>Hijriyyah says Jibral Disah's</i>

41:00.757 --> 41:02.716
escape plan was to go to Islamabad,

41:02.717 --> 41:04.586
and hide out in the I-8 district,

41:04.587 --> 41:06.966
which narrows it down
to this area here.

41:06.967 --> 41:08.466
Well, I-8's residential.

41:08.467 --> 41:09.876
Civilians everywhere.

41:09.877 --> 41:11.180
Exfiltration could be difficult.

41:11.181 --> 41:12.654
Hey, one problem at a time.

41:12.655 --> 41:14.279
Let's find the son of a bitch first.

41:14.280 --> 41:16.390
- (phone chimes)
- Pakistan is ostensibly our ally.

41:16.391 --> 41:18.876
They might be willing to help
us pinpoint his location.

41:18.877 --> 41:21.466
Russell Jackson wants an update.

41:21.467 --> 41:23.857
Finally, we can give
him some good news.

41:27.217 --> 41:30.836
Oh, uh, I told Elizabeth
about Talia Petrov.

41:30.837 --> 41:32.876
She wants you to back off.

41:32.877 --> 41:35.336
Well, the truth is, I'm out of options.

41:35.337 --> 41:38.126
There's nothing more
I can do right now.

41:38.127 --> 41:42.086
And, like you said,
we can't save everyone.

41:42.087 --> 41:44.926
But we saved Hijriyyah.

41:44.927 --> 41:46.187
It's a good day.

41:54.047 --> 41:57.067
You could always find a distance...

41:58.757 --> 42:01.027
...and you never put a foot wrong.

42:04.257 --> 42:06.546
And when I would come to the pasture,

42:06.547 --> 42:08.966
you would run to meet me.

42:08.967 --> 42:12.027
Do you remember?

42:26.927 --> 42:29.767
Thank you for being my horse.

42:32.087 --> 42:33.787
(neighs quietly,
Elizabeth gently laughs)

42:50.967 --> 42:52.767
Thank you for coming back.

42:59.087 --> 43:02.086
Whatever happens...

43:02.087 --> 43:03.767
we're together.

43:06.967 --> 43:14.375
