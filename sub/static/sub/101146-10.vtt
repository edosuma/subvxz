17:13.240 --> 17:14.520
I gave you discipline.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.000
I forged you
into one of our sharpest blades.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.200
I turned you against your Maker.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.480
And I laid the first brick

17:25.920 --> 17:27.880
on your road to salvation.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.320
But I cannot

17:34.080 --> 17:36.240
walk the road for you, my son.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.600
I cannot save you from the flames.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.840
You have to have the will

17:43.800 --> 17:45.560
to do what is necessary.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.640
Do you have the will, my son?

17:55.960 --> 17:56.920
Yes, Father.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.240
Then we shall not speak of this again.

18:14.080 --> 18:17.760
-[Pym] I just found you again, you shit.
-[Nimue] We don't have any choice.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.920
Well, what's gonna happen now?

18:22.120 --> 18:23.120
I don't know.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.880
But if I can, I'll find you.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.800
-I promise.
-[man] Riders, ready!

18:29.880 --> 18:32.720
How am I the one going
to the bloody desert kingdoms now?

18:32.800 --> 18:33.840
[chuckles]

18:34.800 --> 18:36.320
Why does it have to be you?

18:36.960 --> 18:37.880
I'm all right.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.400
I don't care about you.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.800
I'm not all right. [sobs]

18:44.760 --> 18:45.800
[sighs]

18:46.880 --> 18:48.080
I love you, Pym.

18:50.120 --> 18:51.200
[Pym] I love you.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.440
[Fey folk] Born in the dawn...
Born in the dawn...

19:03.520 --> 19:04.760
To pass in the twi...

19:04.840 --> 19:06.160
To pass in the twilight.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.480

[poignant music plays]

19:13.720 --> 19:14.680
[sniffles]

19:15.400 --> 19:17.040
I'll protect them with my life.

19:20.640 --> 19:21.560
I know you will.

19:31.680 --> 19:32.680
[horse snorts]

19:34.680 --> 19:36.000

[ethereal music plays]

20:18.880 --> 20:20.680
[breathing heavily]

20:23.400 --> 20:25.920
He just showed up at the checkpoint,
Your Majesty.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.080
Hello, Uther.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.840
Dispensed with the formalities, have you?

20:34.840 --> 20:35.920
Are you lying to her?

20:37.920 --> 20:38.960
The Fey girl!

20:40.760 --> 20:42.720
Just tell me what your intentions are.

20:43.480 --> 20:46.080
-Did you send this monkey to lie for you?
-Have you lost your wits?

20:46.160 --> 20:48.200
Quiet, fool.
The boy can speak for himself.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.760
[yells] "Boy," is it?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.600
[tuts] You're drunk.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.320
That's not an answer.

20:59.720 --> 21:00.560
[Merlin groans]

21:01.000 --> 21:02.160
[groans]

21:02.800 --> 21:03.800
[exhales slowly]

21:10.840 --> 21:12.480
I guess my wine has spilled.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.760
Who has done this to you?

21:15.840 --> 21:16.840
[Merlin] No one.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.440
Just a fisherman.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.600
I got caught on the wrong hook.

21:22.320 --> 21:24.240
I would think to find you
in better spirits

21:24.320 --> 21:26.480
on the eve
of your greatest victory as king.

21:27.960 --> 21:31.160
You've ended the Fey slaughter,
subdued the Church,

21:31.720 --> 21:34.960
negotiated a firm but just peace
with the leader of the Fey rebellion,

21:35.040 --> 21:38.320
and despite all of my best efforts
to destroy it,

21:38.400 --> 21:40.440
the Sword of Power is within your grasp.

21:40.520 --> 21:43.480
If you dare try to claim credit for this,
we swear, we--

21:43.560 --> 21:44.520
Not at all.

21:53.320 --> 21:54.360
How's your mother?

21:56.080 --> 21:56.960
Dead.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.960
Then you've done all this by yourself.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.240
Bravo, Uther.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.440
I'm proud of you.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.160
[chuckles]

22:16.400 --> 22:17.880
We must confess we have...

22:18.480 --> 22:20.640
longed to hear these words from you.

22:20.720 --> 22:21.760
I mean them.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.440
The midwife was your mother's crime,
Uther.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.280
Not yours.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.240
If you wish to be recognized
as the one true king,

22:33.320 --> 22:36.040
you still have a chance to earn it.
Your way.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.400
Let's end this business
with the sword today.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.240
And so I ask you again:

22:42.640 --> 22:44.840
What are your intentions
with the Fey girl?

22:45.800 --> 22:47.000
You knew?

22:48.800 --> 22:51.440
You knew all along.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.520
You and her, together.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.600
Let's not dwell on the past, Uther.

22:58.520 --> 22:59.520
You are the...

23:00.640 --> 23:02.160
king of lies.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.320
Will you keep your word?

23:06.600 --> 23:08.080
You need your rest.

23:10.680 --> 23:11.680

[groans]

23:19.240 --> 23:21.800
[exhales slowly, weakly]

23:23.080 --> 23:24.360
Get him out of our sight.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.480
A sail!

24:13.320 --> 24:14.800
[man 1] There.... sails.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.240
[man 2] The king has kept his word.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.920
[man 3] This is our chance.

24:20.120 --> 24:21.120
She did it.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.680
[man 4] They have the biggest sails.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.440
-[Arthur] She's saved the Fey!
-[cheering]

24:33.280 --> 24:35.040

Hello?

24:42.560 --> 24:43.800

24:45.840 --> 24:46.920

Who's that?

25:27.400 --> 25:28.600
[ominous music plays]

25:37.840 --> 25:38.960
[Nimue] Sir Steuben.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.240
[Steuben] A raven just arrived.

25:51.560 --> 25:54.120
"Pendragon ships are here. Boarding now."

25:55.240 --> 25:56.600
The king has kept his word.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.200
"All my love. Arthur."

26:00.280 --> 26:01.800
This pleases me, milady.

26:01.880 --> 26:02.960
[exhales slowly]

26:05.520 --> 26:06.520
[relieved sigh]

26:07.880 --> 26:08.800
They're safe.

[eerie whooshing]

27:02.160 --> 27:03.000
My love.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.400
Are you truly here?

27:06.360 --> 27:07.640
You see me, don't you?

27:08.040 --> 27:11.120
-Yeah, but I don't know what to believe.
-[Celia] Believe your eyes.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.480
And be grateful for the sight
you've been given.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.840
To see death is a gift for us both.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.920
For I don't feel so alone.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.000
[mystical twinkling]

27:22.080 --> 27:22.920
Here.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.800
You're not alone.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.000
I feel so ashamed.

27:27.080 --> 27:27.960
[Morgana] Why?

27:28.040 --> 27:30.160
For doubting you.
For standing in your way.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.760
No, you never stood in my way.

27:31.840 --> 27:34.480
You knew your destiny,
but it frightened me.

27:35.480 --> 27:38.760
And yet here you are,
on the precipice of all that you seek.

27:39.160 --> 27:41.760
To see between worlds,
to know the shadows' secrets.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.840
Oh, Celia, I fear I'm not ready.

27:45.040 --> 27:46.280
[whispers] Silly bird,

27:47.040 --> 27:48.600
of course you're not ready.

27:49.320 --> 27:50.640
You've only just begun.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.760
Look at what you've accomplished already.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.200
What have I accomplished?

27:59.520 --> 28:00.760
You have the sword.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.320
Bring the sword
to the temple of the Cailleach,

28:08.400 --> 28:11.320
so that your instruction may begin.
This is how you will save the Fey.

28:11.760 --> 28:13.560
No, it wasn't given to me.

28:14.280 --> 28:16.120
She asked me to hold it for her.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.960
She entrusted me with it.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.240
I know you care for her,

28:22.720 --> 28:25.160
but this is where Nimue's journey ends,

28:25.840 --> 28:26.840
my love.

28:27.520 --> 28:28.960
-I'm so sorry.
-No.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.920
I want to help her,
but the Widow stalks her.

28:32.000 --> 28:32.840
[Morgana] No!

28:32.920 --> 28:35.440
A daughter of Death,
there's no escaping her summons.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.520
I have to warn her.

28:36.600 --> 28:37.520
Morgana.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.360
Morgana!

28:40.520 --> 28:43.080
Don't confront the Widow.
She's not of this world!

-[paladin 3] She's evil!

28:56.160 --> 28:58.160
[paladins] Witch! Devil! Burn her!

28:58.240 --> 28:59.080
Horrible!

28:59.640 --> 29:01.240
-Get rid of her!
-Devil witch!

29:14.560 --> 29:15.400
Well?

29:19.360 --> 29:21.440
She doesn't have the sword, Your Majesty.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.440
Why not? Where is it?

29:28.320 --> 29:29.160
I'm...

29:30.280 --> 29:32.360
-It is in--
-Do you think you're very clever?

29:33.520 --> 29:34.720
No. No, Your...

29:34.800 --> 29:37.600
-Where's the bloody sword?
-[ominous music plays]

29:38.040 --> 29:39.680
[breathes shakily]

29:41.520 --> 29:43.720
She mocks your kindness, Your Majesty.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.120
I wouldn't waste another breath on her.

29:46.480 --> 29:50.720
We are more than capable of drawing out
the location of the sword from her.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.280
Indeed it would be a privilege.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.240
[Abbot] Give us the witch,

29:55.680 --> 29:58.520
and the sword will be yours by sundown,
Your Highness.

30:03.240 --> 30:05.320
Do you presume us merciful, girl?

30:08.480 --> 30:09.680
You presume wrong.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.440
You are aware what awaits you

30:12.520 --> 30:16.280
should we hand you over to Father Carden
and his Red Paladins?

30:16.360 --> 30:18.200
Very aware, Your Majesty.

30:21.720 --> 30:22.960
He had my mother killed.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.720
Burned my village down. Burned them all.

30:27.680 --> 30:28.720
I know him well.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.960
[Carden] And before it is done,

30:32.440 --> 30:36.800
we will humble you before Almighty God,
girl, I swear it.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.040
That's what your boys in Gramaire thought.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.560
[tense music plays]

30:40.640 --> 30:43.480
And Yvoire Abbey and the Red Lake.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.560
You've emboldened this witch,
Your Majesty.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.520
We will ask you very simply now, girl:

30:50.960 --> 30:51.960
Where's the sword?

30:52.360 --> 30:53.680
You will have your sword.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.280
As soon as the Green Knight and the boy,
Squirrel, are returned to me alive.

30:58.600 --> 31:03.200
That Fey assassin and his little spy
are our prisoners, Your Majesty.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.520
They're not for trading.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.480
Then you have Squirrel?

31:07.080 --> 31:08.000
Aye.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.400
And if you don't sing for us,

31:10.760 --> 31:12.000
he most surely will.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.120
Touch him,
and I'll see you choked on your own blood!

31:14.200 --> 31:16.560
-Divine forces protect me, demon.
-Enough!

31:16.640 --> 31:18.360
If my people are not returned,
by the Hidden,

31:18.440 --> 31:20.480
I vow you will never see
the Sword of Power.

31:22.280 --> 31:23.280
[Carden] Your Majesty,

31:27.200 --> 31:28.720
give her to us.

31:28.800 --> 31:29.800
[Nimue] Torture me.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.640
Skin me to my bones. I'll never tell you.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.920
I'm ready to die, Carden. Are you?

31:37.040 --> 31:38.840
[Uther] Gods,
it will give us great pleasure

31:38.920 --> 31:40.480
to be rid of you both.

31:40.880 --> 31:42.560
You have your bloody nerve.

31:43.120 --> 31:47.040
To make further demands on us
after we have dealt with you so fairly.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.680
You have my life, Your Highness.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.520
If you want my sword as well,
it comes at a cost.

31:55.920 --> 31:57.120
Your sword?

31:57.840 --> 32:00.440
[chuckles]

32:01.600 --> 32:05.400
[whispers] Your Majesty,
if Carden takes, Carden's sword...

32:10.960 --> 32:12.960
Take her away and keep her under guard
