-Hi.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.360
What?

02:26.280 --> 02:27.280
Nothing.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.440
Are you all right?

02:32.520 --> 02:33.800
I mean, was it...

02:34.440 --> 02:35.280
Yes.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.440
It was different

02:38.120 --> 02:39.200
to what I thought.

02:40.040 --> 02:40.880
Oh...

02:41.640 --> 02:42.600
A good different?

02:42.680 --> 02:44.320
Yes. No, I didn't mean it was...

02:46.760 --> 02:47.880
It was lovely.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.880
-Was...
-No. Uh, yes.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.040
Amazing.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.640
[Nimue] What happened?

04:04.320 --> 04:05.880
His throat was cut first,

04:07.480 --> 04:08.480
then he was burned.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.400
[Cora] This is Wroth and his blood vow.

Wroth has claimed the southern gate road

and threatened to kill any Fey
that agree to this Pendragon offer.

My men have already been fired upon
this morning.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.240
[Arthur] Nimue is offering her life
for these ships.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.320
To refuse them is death.
I'll go see Wroth.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.560
This is my doing. I'll go.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.600
I can't risk anything happening to you.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.520
At my age, you grow vulnerable to drafts.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.440
That's a poor lie. You can do better.

05:40.320 --> 05:43.640
I fear my presence here
endangers your agreement with King Uther.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.360
It's a risk I have to take.
There's no other choice.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.440
[Merlin] There is.

05:49.240 --> 05:53.040
By sating his thirst for revenge,
we might lure out his better angels.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.280
How?

05:56.680 --> 05:57.680
Give him me.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.440
What?

06:00.520 --> 06:02.680
He's longed for my head for some time.

06:04.600 --> 06:07.040
You're mad. No. I forbid it.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.800
With respect, you are Queen of the Fey,
not of Merlin.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.360
I told you I don't want your protection.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.400
Well, I have a terrible habit
of not doing what I'm told.

of getting audience with Uther

06:25.280 --> 06:26.680
and divining his intentions.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.040
If I sense betrayal is afoot,

06:31.480 --> 06:33.080
I'll do all I can to warn you.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.560
I don't want to see you hurt
because of me.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.320
I don't want anyone else to be hurt
because of me.

06:43.760 --> 06:44.960
Well, that's just it.

And I cannot sway you from this course?

Don't you, Wroth?

08:15.920 --> 08:17.600

of a great warrior clan was slaughtered

08:26.400 --> 08:27.640

08:29.160 --> 08:31.960
Or you could be the first chief
of a new age,

who saved his people, languages,
and rituals for generations to come.

of Wroth the Just,

-She has given you the unnatural sight.

-I'm not the unnatural one here.

You claim them, don't you?

10:45.120 --> 10:46.880
You sort of claim the dead somehow.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.440
Wait, why are you in this chamber?

10:51.520 --> 10:52.920
[Widow] Do not question me!

10:54.720 --> 10:57.240
And make no effort to interfere,

10:58.200 --> 11:00.440

I thought you were in Hawksbridge

I wasn't terrible?
I mean, that's nice of you to say.

You thought you were just
the most devastating thing ever.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.400
I gave you scripture.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.520
I gave you discipline.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.000
I forged you
into one of our sharpest blades.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.200
I turned you against your Maker.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.480
And I laid the first brick

17:25.920 --> 17:27.880
on your road to salvation.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.320
But I cannot

17:34.080 --> 17:36.240
walk the road for you, my son.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.600
I cannot save you from the flames.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.840
You have to have the will

17:43.800 --> 17:45.560
to do what is necessary.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.640
Do you have the will, my son?

17:55.960 --> 17:56.920
Yes, Father.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.240
Then we shall not speak of this again.

18:14.080 --> 18:17.760
-[Pym] I just found you again, you shit.
-[Nimue] We don't have any choice.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.920
Well, what's gonna happen now?

18:22.120 --> 18:23.120
I don't know.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.880
But if I can, I'll find you.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.800
-I promise.
-[man] Riders, ready!

18:29.880 --> 18:32.720
How am I the one going
to the bloody desert kingdoms now?

18:32.800 --> 18:33.840
[chuckles]

18:34.800 --> 18:36.320
Why does it have to be you?

18:36.960 --> 18:37.880
I'm all right.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.400
I don't care about you.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.800
I'm not all right. [sobs]

18:44.760 --> 18:45.800
[sighs]

18:46.880 --> 18:48.080
I love you, Pym.

18:50.120 --> 18:51.200
[Pym] I love you.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.440
[Fey folk] Born in the dawn...
Born in the dawn...

19:15.400 --> 19:17.040

20:23.400 --> 20:25.920
He just showed up at the checkpoint,
Your Majesty.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.080
Hello, Uther.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.840
Dispensed with the formalities, have you?

20:34.840 --> 20:35.920
Are you lying to her?

20:37.920 --> 20:38.960
The Fey girl!

20:40.760 --> 20:42.720
Just tell me what your intentions are.

20:43.480 --> 20:46.080
-Did you send this monkey to lie for you?
-Have you lost your wits?

20:46.160 --> 20:48.200
Quiet, fool.
The boy can speak for himself.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.760
[yells] "Boy," is it?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.600
[tuts] You're drunk.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.320
That's not an answer.

21:02.800 --> 21:03.800
[exhales slowly]

21:10.840 --> 21:12.480
I guess my wine has spilled.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.760
Who has done this to you?

21:15.840 --> 21:16.840
[Merlin] No one.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.440
Just a fisherman.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.600
I got caught on the wrong hook.

21:22.320 --> 21:24.240
I would think to find you
in better spirits

21:24.320 --> 21:26.480
on the eve
of your greatest victory as king.

21:27.960 --> 21:31.160
You've ended the Fey slaughter,
subdued the Church,

21:31.720 --> 21:34.960
negotiated a firm but just peace
with the leader of the Fey rebellion,

21:35.040 --> 21:38.320
and despite all of my best efforts
to destroy it,

21:38.400 --> 21:40.440
the Sword of Power is within your grasp.

21:40.520 --> 21:43.480
If you dare try to claim credit for this,
we swear, we--

21:43.560 --> 21:44.520
Not at all.

21:53.320 --> 21:54.360
How's your mother?

21:56.080 --> 21:56.960
Dead.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.960
Then you've done all this by yourself.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.240
Bravo, Uther.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.440
I'm proud of you.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.160
[chuckles]

22:16.400 --> 22:17.880
We must confess we have...

22:18.480 --> 22:20.640
longed to hear these words from you.

22:20.720 --> 22:21.760
I mean them.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.440
The midwife was your mother's crime,
Uther.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.280
Not yours.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.240
If you wish to be recognized
as the one true king,

22:33.320 --> 22:36.040
you still have a chance to earn it.
Your way.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.400
Let's end this business
with the sword today.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.240
And so I ask you again:

22:42.640 --> 22:44.840
What are your intentions
with the Fey girl?

22:45.800 --> 22:47.000
You knew?

22:48.800 --> 22:51.440
You knew all along.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.520
You and her, together.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.600
Let's not dwell on the past, Uther.

22:58.520 --> 22:59.520
You are the...

23:00.640 --> 23:02.160
king of lies.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.320
Will you keep your word?

23:06.600 --> 23:08.080
You need your rest.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.240
[man 2] The king has kept his word.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.920
[man 3] This is our chance.

24:20.120 --> 24:21.120
She did it.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.680
[man 4] They have the biggest sails.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.440

25:51.560 --> 25:54.120
"Pendragon ships are here. Boarding now."

25:55.240 --> 25:56.600
The king has kept his word.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.200
"All my love. Arthur."

This pleases me, milady.

Are you truly here?

You see me, don't you?

27:08.040 --> 27:11.120
-Yeah, but I don't know what to believe.
-[Celia] Believe your eyes.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.480
And be grateful for the sight
you've been given.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.840
To see death is a gift for us both.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.920
For I don't feel so alone.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.000
[mystical twinkling]

27:22.080 --> 27:22.920
Here.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.800
You're not alone.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.000
I feel so ashamed.

27:27.080 --> 27:27.960
[Morgana] Why?

27:28.040 --> 27:30.160
For doubting you.
For standing in your way.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.760
No, you never stood in my way.

27:31.840 --> 27:34.480
You knew your destiny,
but it frightened me.

27:35.480 --> 27:38.760
And yet here you are,
on the precipice of all that you seek.

27:39.160 --> 27:41.760
To see between worlds,
to know the shadows' secrets.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.840
Oh, Celia, I fear I'm not ready.

27:45.040 --> 27:46.280
[whispers] Silly bird,

27:47.040 --> 27:48.600
of course you're not ready.

27:49.320 --> 27:50.640
You've only just begun.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.760
Look at what you've accomplished already.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.200
What have I accomplished?

27:59.520 --> 28:00.760
You have the sword.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.320
Bring the sword
to the temple of the Cailleach,

28:08.400 --> 28:11.320
so that your instruction may begin.
This is how you will save the Fey.

28:11.760 --> 28:13.560
No, it wasn't given to me.

28:14.280 --> 28:16.120
She asked me to hold it for her.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.960
She entrusted me with it.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.240
I know you care for her,

28:22.720 --> 28:25.160
but this is where Nimue's journey ends,

28:27.520 --> 28:28.960
-I'm so sorry.
-No.

I want to help her,
but the Widow stalks her.

28:32.000 --> 28:32.840
[Morgana] No!

there's no escaping her summons.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.520

29:41.520 --> 29:43.720

29:44.160 --> 29:46.120
I wouldn't waste another breath on her.

29:46.480 --> 29:50.720
We are more than capable of drawing out
the location of the sword from her.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.280
Indeed it would be a privilege.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.240

29:55.680 --> 29:58.520
and the sword will be yours by sundown,
Your Highness.

30:03.240 --> 30:05.320
Do you presume us merciful, girl?

30:08.480 --> 30:09.680
You presume wrong.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.440
You are aware what awaits you

30:12.520 --> 30:16.280
should we hand you over to Father Carden
and his Red Paladins?

30:16.360 --> 30:18.200
Very aware, Your Majesty.

30:21.720 --> 30:22.960
He had my mother killed.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.720
Burned my village down. Burned them all.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.960
[Carden] And before it is done,

30:32.440 --> 30:36.800
we will humble you before Almighty God,
girl, I swear it.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.040
That's what your boys in Gramaire thought.

And Yvoire Abbey and the Red Lake.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.560
You've emboldened this witch,
Your Majesty.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.520
We will ask you very simply now, girl:

30:50.960 --> 30:51.960
Where's the sword?

30:52.360 --> 30:53.680
You will have your sword.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.280
As soon as the Green Knight and the boy,
Squirrel, are returned to me alive.

30:58.600 --> 31:03.200
That Fey assassin and his little spy
are our prisoners, Your Majesty.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.520
They're not for trading.

Aye.

And if you don't sing for us,

31:10.760 --> 31:12.000
he most surely will.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.120

and I'll see you choked on your own blood!

by the Hidden,
