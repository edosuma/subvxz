00:01.502 --> 00:03.921
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:05.297 --> 00:06.674
<i>We're being shot out of the sky.</i>

00:08.926 --> 00:10.636
- Daisy!
- Were you able to save Mack?

00:10.803 --> 00:12.179
I'm so sorry.

00:12.304 --> 00:15.349
<i>You saw it with your own eyes.
It's a computer program.</i>

00:15.474 --> 00:17.226
<i>I don't want to live in a world
without Hope.</i>

00:17.393 --> 00:19.687
Everything I need, it's all right here.

00:20.021 --> 00:21.605
- What have I done?
- Don't blame yourself.

00:21.731 --> 00:23.232
The Framework messes
with everybody's head.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.944
- No, no, but I... I... I killed people.
- And Director Mace.

00:29.113 --> 00:30.740
<i>She's not a robot anymore.</i>

00:30.865 --> 00:34.201
Finally, you can touch the real me.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.120
Fitz, move!

01:17.953 --> 01:21.624
There are actually
a few funny passages in here.

01:25.669 --> 01:28.839
Has the little puppet
finally made herself into a real girl?

01:31.842 --> 01:34.678
I'm tired of talking to myself.

01:42.186 --> 01:43.521
Fitz, move!

01:44.563 --> 01:46.816
- Take the shot, May!
- Get out of the way, Fitz!

01:46.941 --> 01:48.192
Just take the shot!

01:51.695 --> 01:52.780
No.

01:53.072 --> 01:54.406
No, no, no!

01:55.491 --> 01:58.327
She has Inhuman powers, now?
Can we get a break, please?

01:58.452 --> 02:00.538
Can we get one break?

02:00.704 --> 02:03.374
Guess they weren't
assessing powers at Hydra

02:03.499 --> 02:04.959
as much as collecting them.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.461
Who even knows what Hydra was doing
in the Framework.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.213
Oh, wait.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.048
You do, I guess, right?

02:11.590 --> 02:13.968
Sorry, I'm having trouble sorting
through the...

02:14.218 --> 02:15.553
Two lives we lived?

02:15.928 --> 02:17.096
You feel that, too, uh?

02:18.722 --> 02:19.932
Nice to see you again.

02:20.599 --> 02:21.767
Actual you.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.645
- We're lucky we got out of there.
- It wasn't luck.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.608
You are only alive
because I had restrictions put on me.

02:30.734 --> 02:31.819
Fortunately...

02:32.570 --> 02:34.613
those restrictions have just been lifted.

02:35.239 --> 02:36.740
Who the hell is this guy?

02:37.366 --> 02:39.869
Well, you missed a fair amount, May,
but the quick version is...

02:40.494 --> 02:41.662
you can go ahead and shoot him.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.386
You are nothing now without a S.H.I.E.L.D.
to hide behind.

03:05.269 --> 03:06.604
That's not all they're good for.

03:12.610 --> 03:13.611
Robots...

03:13.986 --> 03:18.449
- is that a common occurrence now?
- Like I said... you missed a fair amount.

03:33.339 --> 03:34.465
It's good to be back.

03:52.650 --> 03:53.651
How many hits have we taken?

03:53.817 --> 03:54.818
- Three.
- Three. The <i>Zephyr's</i> like

03:54.985 --> 03:55.986
a tank she's holding together.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.197
Yeah, but we had to pull the plug
on everything except for flight control

03:58.280 --> 03:59.615
to keep the Framework running
for you guys.

03:59.657 --> 04:01.575
- So, we can't fight back.
- Or see where it's coming from.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.912
Davis! Try any evasive manoeuvre you can!

04:05.120 --> 04:06.830
Not the only genius to think of that,
thanks,

04:06.997 --> 04:08.290
but this thing also moves like a tank,

04:08.415 --> 04:11.543
so, everybody get off my back.

04:12.378 --> 04:15.005
We need guns! We've got power now
that these two are out, no?

04:15.130 --> 04:16.798
We'll head to the avionics bay
and re-patch.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.009
Piper, are you up
for manning the weapons?

04:19.176 --> 04:20.469
I'm offended you had to ask.

04:21.971 --> 04:23.973
- Is Mack okay?
- He's alive, yes.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.016
What the hell happened?
Why didn't you save him?

04:26.183 --> 04:27.851
- Not now, Yo-Yo!
<i>- Madres!</i>

04:31.981 --> 04:33.107
What do we do now?

04:33.232 --> 04:35.109
Better hope Z-One can take
a few more hits.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.819
Who's firing on us, anyway?

04:37.069 --> 04:38.279
<i>We call him "the Russian."</i>

04:38.570 --> 04:40.364
'Cause, you know, he's Russian.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.075
Radcliffe teamed up with him
for protection.

04:43.617 --> 04:47.288
After he replaced me
with a robot version of myself.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.873
- Just to clarify.
- The technical term is "Android,"

04:50.165 --> 04:54.378
- but yeah. You remember any of that?
- I remember getting hit in the head.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.964
Should've stayed in that damn spa.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.175
You must've spotted the decoy right away,
right?

05:00.718 --> 05:02.636
Yeah, 'cause you're never robotic at all.

05:03.846 --> 05:04.888
Oh, really?

05:05.514 --> 05:07.224
How long did it take you to figure it out?

05:08.684 --> 05:09.727
Wow.

05:10.561 --> 05:11.729
I'm hurt, Phil.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.148
Guess we're not as close
as I thought.

05:14.732 --> 05:16.066
What finally tipped it?

05:17.401 --> 05:19.111
A series of events.

05:19.445 --> 05:21.030
Didn't get messy between us, did it?

05:21.322 --> 05:23.782
Messy? That's a relative term,
wouldn't you say?

05:24.575 --> 05:26.994
Okay. This ought to keep this door shut
for a while.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.664
So, how did things end with Robbie Reyes?

05:31.248 --> 05:34.168
Last I remember,
we were chasing down his uncle.

05:34.543 --> 05:37.087
Oh, you know, guy tried to become a god,

05:37.254 --> 05:39.882
so, we opened up a portal
beneath his quantum-power cube,

05:40.007 --> 05:43.010
then Ghost Rider dragged him to another
dimension with his hellfire chain.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.764
- So, things ended well, then.
- Well as can be expected.

05:47.348 --> 05:48.432
Man, what a run.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.642
- After we escape this place...
- Yeah.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.437
...we're definitely opening that bottle
of Haig.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.731
Yeah, totally.

05:56.106 --> 06:00.611
Hey, but, listen. Escape is not an option.
Mack has to stay plugged in.

06:00.986 --> 06:03.447
If we wake him up, it'll fry his brain.

06:03.739 --> 06:06.200
So we need to take control
of the space.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.534
By force.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.119
I can barely stand.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.372
Yeah, well, hopefully,
we won't have to do it alone.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.956
Help should be on the way.

06:16.460 --> 06:17.836
The fire's eating our oxygen!

06:17.961 --> 06:19.671
We're losing air, people!

06:20.756 --> 06:23.467
Okay, if you can get the fire out,
there's a thick, black power cable

06:23.592 --> 06:25.511
that runs high along the wall
to the avionics bay.

06:25.636 --> 06:28.472
I need you to tear that off the wall,
and drag it up here so that we can...

06:29.306 --> 06:31.809
- Got it.
- Oh. Well, okay, then.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.144
- Great. Now where do we plug this into?
- Over here.

06:46.615 --> 06:47.991
You've got to be kidding me!

06:52.037 --> 06:54.331
- Come on, Davis! What are you doing?
- Lance, I swear, one more word from you,

06:54.373 --> 06:55.916
I drop the controls to kick your ass.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.919
Where is he? Can you see anything?

06:59.169 --> 07:00.879
No, Piper, I can only see what's...

07:01.505 --> 07:03.048
right in front of me.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.051
He's right in front of us!

07:06.885 --> 07:08.303
Oh, he's heading straight for us!

07:08.762 --> 07:10.556
Hey, hurry! This guy's going kamikaze!

07:23.610 --> 07:24.903
Whoo!

07:29.867 --> 07:32.369
Okay.
Give Davis the coordinates of the oil rig.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.912
We need to get there ASAP.

07:34.204 --> 07:37.082
- Think about how confused our people are.
- Yeah, especially Fitz.

07:37.708 --> 07:40.544
He woke from the worst nightmare of all,
one in which he was the monster.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.523
I had no idea.

08:03.525 --> 08:07.321
I've only emulated human reactions,
but to actually feel...

08:10.491 --> 08:13.744
the warm sand,
the water rushing over me...

08:14.703 --> 08:15.871
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

08:19.791 --> 08:20.918
I'm sorry.

08:21.585 --> 08:24.546
You must be overwhelmed.
Two lives' worth of memories.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.424
Only one type of person
could do those things.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.093
You did what you had to do...

08:31.011 --> 08:32.596
in order to survive the Framework.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.556
But it was a simulation.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.186
An illusion created by Radcliffe.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.899
You were there.

08:44.900 --> 08:45.984
Alongside me the whole time.

08:46.485 --> 08:49.947
Allowing hor... horrific acts of violence
to be carried out in your name.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.533
You're implying I had a choice.

08:53.659 --> 08:54.868
I was a slave...

08:55.702 --> 08:58.288
programmed to make the adjustments
Radcliffe required.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.666
The world changed from there. I...

09:01.375 --> 09:02.876
All I did was try to fit into it.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.795
No, you lied about everything.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.463
But I told you the truth about this world.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.967
Yeah, but... but you...
you manipulated me.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.386
Every decision you made was your own.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.389
Besides restoring your relationship
with your father,

09:15.514 --> 09:17.683
the only other change I made
in your life was...

09:18.475 --> 09:19.893
introducing myself.

09:22.813 --> 09:24.481
First day of class at academy...

09:27.150 --> 09:28.318
Befriending you...

09:29.486 --> 09:32.656
trying to understand what it felt like
to connect with someone.

09:33.407 --> 09:36.118
But I wasn't able
to actually feel anything.

09:37.661 --> 09:38.829
Until today.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.664
I'm feeling...

09:41.331 --> 09:42.374
love...

09:42.624 --> 09:44.001
wonder, joy...

09:44.668 --> 09:48.797
for the very first time and I think
my heart might burst from it.

09:49.339 --> 09:52.801
At last, I get to make my own choices,
and...

09:55.345 --> 09:57.055
And the first thing I choose, Leopold...

09:58.974 --> 10:00.017
is you.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.745
- It's not that simple!
- Then explain it to me.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.538
What stopped you?
He was right there with you, no?

10:21.580 --> 10:22.664
Yes, but he didn't want to come.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.875
Oh, you only bring back the people
that matter to you, not to me!

10:24.916 --> 10:26.376
You know what?
I've known Mack longer than you,

10:26.501 --> 10:28.337
- and he means as much to me...
- You promised! You promised me!

10:28.462 --> 10:29.630
I tried!

10:30.005 --> 10:32.049
- He didn't want to come back!
- Who cares?

10:32.215 --> 10:34.259
You knock him over the head,
you break his legs,

10:34.426 --> 10:36.678
you kick him through the exit!
It was a video game!

10:36.803 --> 10:38.263
He didn't want to leave Hope!

10:41.183 --> 10:42.809
Hope? His daughter?

10:44.102 --> 10:45.812
You knew about her?

10:46.855 --> 10:48.398
Because I didn't.

10:48.774 --> 10:50.150
Not until I saw her face.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.235
She's dead.

10:52.903 --> 10:54.655
Yeah, well, in there, she's ten.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.699
And she's bright and adorable...

10:58.116 --> 10:59.451
and she means the world to him,

11:00.118 --> 11:01.703
even if it's not a real world.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.081
I'm sorry.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.583
He wouldn't have left her for anything.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.088
Even me.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.423
He didn't remember you, Yo-Yo.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.677
I'm so sorry.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.595
Then I'll go remind him.

11:19.262 --> 11:22.265
- What? No, no, no. No. Do not...
- I'll go get him out myself.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.600
Do not do that.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.103
Besides the fact that going
into that world as an Inhuman

11:26.228 --> 11:28.563
is the worst idea ever. We need you here,

11:28.939 --> 11:32.401
making sure that the real Mack
stays alive, or it'll all be for nothing.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.447
Coulson and May
just woke up next to Mack

11:37.614 --> 11:40.450
with no idea where they are
or what they're up against.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.705
I know where we are, I think.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.959
In the '50s, the Soviets built
top-secret submarine refuelling stations

11:49.084 --> 11:50.419
under oil-drilling platforms.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.546
This might be one.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.381
You can tell from the one fish we've seen,

11:54.506 --> 11:56.383
or did you learn
that in a S.H.I.E.L.D. briefing?

11:56.508 --> 11:58.468
Neither.
I know from being a history teacher.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.345
I was kind of a Cold War buff.

12:00.804 --> 12:02.723
Can't believe I'm seeing this
with his own eyes.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.475
Hmm. Well, you almost make it sound
like it's good news.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.269
Not a lot of help here.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.980
We have saline,
all the B12 we could ever need.

12:10.147 --> 12:13.567
- So, we're safe from a hangover.
- Hmm. And epinephrine.

12:14.776 --> 12:15.902
Emergency dose.

12:17.446 --> 12:18.613
That's too dangerous.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.659
Might give me enough adrenaline to take
on some terminators.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.327
I'll find a way to take them myself.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.496
I don't want any more bad to happen
to you.

12:26.538 --> 12:29.374
Me? I got out unscathed. Jeffrey didn't.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.461
He should be in here with us,
still in the fight.

12:33.295 --> 12:35.630
- I need to take one for the team.
- You'll be useless afterwards,

12:35.881 --> 12:39.176
- unconscious or unresponsive.
- Well, so you give me mouth-to-mouth.

12:44.848 --> 12:47.768
What's up?
You mad that I was Hydra in there?

12:49.936 --> 12:52.189
- I don't blame you for that.
- Then, what?

12:54.775 --> 12:57.486
Did something weird happen
with my robot self?

12:59.613 --> 13:01.156
Did I make a move on you?

13:02.699 --> 13:04.701
Phil, did I try to...

13:05.702 --> 13:06.828
kill you?

13:07.537 --> 13:08.747
Kill me, yep.

13:08.997 --> 13:12.042
That's what happened.
You tried. It was messed up.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.420
Well, let's add it to the list.

13:16.213 --> 13:18.423
Just make sure I'm still breathing
when the team arrives, uh?

13:20.842 --> 13:22.344
So, you can't go any faster?

13:22.552 --> 13:24.429
The only fuel left
is in the centre wing tank.

13:24.638 --> 13:25.972
And we burned all of our electrical power

13:26.139 --> 13:27.724
keeping you guys plugged
into the Framework.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.434
So, no problem. Don't mention it.

13:29.643 --> 13:33.063
But why didn't you touch down
at any point? Recharge and refuel?

13:35.357 --> 13:36.608
We should show them.

13:40.070 --> 13:43.949
<i>Like I said, with an explosion that size,
we still have a lot to sift through</i>

13:44.074 --> 13:47.202
<i>at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters.
The entire area is sealed off, but, no,</i>

13:47.327 --> 13:49.246
<i>I can't rule out Daisy Johnson's
involvement.</i>

13:49.704 --> 13:51.748
<i>- Tommy?</i>
- It's been playing on every channel.

13:52.082 --> 13:55.043
<i>Sir, any truth to reports
that Director Jeffrey Mace's body has,</i>

13:55.168 --> 13:56.294
<i>in fact, been found?</i>

13:56.503 --> 13:57.838
<i>I have no new information about that,</i>

13:58.004 --> 13:59.714
<i>but I can assure you,
the manhunt for the members</i>

13:59.881 --> 14:02.217
<i>within S.H.I.E.L.D. who remain at large
is still our top priority.</i>

14:02.425 --> 14:03.885
<i>We can only assume
that they're behind this attack.</i>

14:04.010 --> 14:06.638
<i>Look, they're terrorists,
and we're not gonna rest</i>

14:06.930 --> 14:10.892
<i>until we take them down
and find out exactly who's responsible.</i>

14:20.527 --> 14:22.404
You thought this would make
the transition easier.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.073
I knew you'd be sorting through two lives,
so...

14:25.824 --> 14:27.242
I tried to please both.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.036
It's a familiar space.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.414
But I thought
we could decorate it together.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.636
It's too much. I know.
It was a silly idea.

14:48.805 --> 14:52.058
Sentimental attachment to objects
was hard for me to understand.

14:52.642 --> 14:53.727
Until now.

14:53.977 --> 14:58.648
Now taste, touch,
every sense gives me a rush.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.653
I've felt your touch before.

15:05.071 --> 15:08.325
But now I get to experience
the ecstasy you felt...

15:08.992 --> 15:10.118
each time.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.998
Do you... do you have empathy?

15:16.207 --> 15:18.168
Can you imagine
how somebody else might feel?

15:18.501 --> 15:19.586
I can.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.004
Especially you.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.506
How confusing this must be.

15:23.757 --> 15:27.469
So, you can imagine
how your actions could be perceived.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.014
You were ruthless.

15:31.139 --> 15:34.184
I was ruthless to win the heart of the man
I love...

15:35.101 --> 15:36.519
the man you grew to be.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.688
My father's son.

15:42.734 --> 15:45.278
I thought his presence
is what you'd have wished for.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.197
I'm sorry.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.616
I was just programmed to make you happy.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.369
To make all of you happy.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.288
Who?

15:58.083 --> 16:00.543
Radcliffe, our team, yeah.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.505
Who else is on that list?

16:06.216 --> 16:07.342
Oh, no.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.719
What did you promise the Russian?

16:12.138 --> 16:14.099
What's waiting back there for my friends?

17:47.859 --> 17:48.902
Hey.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.361
Well done.

17:50.779 --> 17:51.988
You, too.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.657
- Doesn't make sense, though.
- Yeah...

17:55.033 --> 17:57.160
if they wanted to kill us,
they could've just flooded the place.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.120
Why were they stalling?

18:04.959 --> 18:06.086
That's all of it.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.588
Detach the submarine
and launch the torpedoes.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.051
Shame.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.844
I will miss that place.

18:24.687 --> 18:25.855
Come on, stay awake.

18:26.356 --> 18:27.774
We need to find a way to the surface.

18:28.650 --> 18:31.319
Um... And I haven't been totally honest
with you

18:31.694 --> 18:34.114
about what happened
when you were not around.

18:34.239 --> 18:36.533
- I knew something was up.
- Yeah.

18:36.699 --> 18:37.867
What are you not telling me?

18:38.284 --> 18:40.787
- I drank the bottle of Haig.
- What? You piece of...

18:46.543 --> 18:49.629
- We got to get to the surface!
- We can't leave Mack!

18:49.879 --> 18:51.714
You'll drown down here!

18:51.881 --> 18:53.633
I'll get you up top,
then I'll come back for him!

18:54.259 --> 18:56.469
Come on!

19:02.725 --> 19:04.727
- Come on.
- They could be fighting for their lives.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.563
You need to go back
and get them out of there.

19:06.688 --> 19:09.732
I... I'm... I'm sorry. I'm... I'm...
I'm having trouble thinking clearly,

19:09.899 --> 19:11.276
- an... analysing the situation.
- Okay, hey.

19:11.401 --> 19:15.071
Hey, no, no. Don't think, don't think.
What do you feel that you should do?

19:15.196 --> 19:16.447
I don't know.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.241
- I'm scared.
- Okay.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.702
Agent May had a gun, ready to kill me.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.247
I don't want to die.

19:25.623 --> 19:28.084
I'm afraid to die.

19:28.543 --> 19:30.920
But... but... but you feel compassion,
yeah?

19:31.129 --> 19:33.923
Because if... if you really believe
that you are capable of love...

19:35.341 --> 19:38.386
- And being loved.
- If you really believe that...

19:39.179 --> 19:43.016
that... that all the hurtful things
you did were not your choice...

19:43.600 --> 19:44.893
make your own choice now.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.312
Do the right thing.

19:48.479 --> 19:49.814
Focus on empathy...

19:50.607 --> 19:51.858
- not fear.
- Yes!

19:52.609 --> 19:53.776
Think about what they're feeling...

19:54.319 --> 19:56.613
the people that you put
in a life-or-death situation.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.239
Ophelia...

19:59.616 --> 20:00.950
they don't want to die, either.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.912
Please, save them.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.267
Where have you been?

20:26.559 --> 20:28.144
I want you to call off your dogs.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.313
Leave the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents alone.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.106
I can't wait to hear this.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.318
I'm now realising the pain
that I've caused,

20:35.443 --> 20:37.320
and I don't want to hurt anyone else.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.656
Congratulations.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.991
You're as close to human
as you'll ever get...

20:42.659 --> 20:43.660
suffering...

20:44.035 --> 20:46.412
from the one thing that you kept trying
to remove...

20:47.163 --> 20:48.915
regret.

20:49.374 --> 20:52.335
Do you understand irony yet?
'Cause this is a good example.

20:52.877 --> 20:58.424
- Give the order to stop, now!
- You no longer control me, remember?

21:00.927 --> 21:04.430
You are free to do whatever you want,
but so am I.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.140
You promised me joy.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.184
This will bring me joy.

21:08.643 --> 21:09.727
Don't you have empathy?

21:09.978 --> 21:12.230
You watched, unaffected,
as I took a hammer to the bones

21:12.355 --> 21:13.648
of the Director's corpse.

21:13.815 --> 21:17.527
- I couldn't feel this then!
- Now you are like an infant,

21:17.986 --> 21:21.072
unable to process these new emotions
or the idea

21:21.197 --> 21:24.492
that you don't always get everything
that you want.

21:25.076 --> 21:28.663
And you have yet to experience
the thrill that killing can bring.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.836
Maybe I'll experience that now, with you.

21:35.378 --> 21:39.132
Destroy this body, sure.
It was designed only for killing.

21:39.966 --> 21:44.554
My head, which you severed,
is controlling many of these machines now.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.472
And you don't know where it is.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.683
So, do what you want to this body.

21:49.267 --> 21:52.603
My plan is in motion.
And nothing can stop it now.

21:59.569 --> 22:00.653
What happened?

22:00.903 --> 22:02.196
What's going on?

22:06.576 --> 22:08.578
Oh. Perfect timing.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.413
Hi, everybody.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.332
She's very weak.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.917
And Mack?

22:15.084 --> 22:16.044
Down below.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.420
We have to keep him attached
to the equipment

22:17.462 --> 22:19.255
so, before we can...

22:20.131 --> 22:21.424
- You okay?
- Yeah.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.386
Go!

22:29.265 --> 22:30.600
No more elevator.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.269
Where are the stairs?

22:33.603 --> 22:36.356
They've collapsed, too.
You need to get off the rig now.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.649
<i>Repeat, the structure is about to crumble!</i>

22:38.775 --> 22:40.401
Guys, you need to get
in the containment module

22:40.526 --> 22:41.903
- and in the air!
- No.

22:42.487 --> 22:44.781
You got to get in here
before this rig goes down!

22:44.947 --> 22:47.283
No, I won't leave without Mack,
not this time!

22:56.334 --> 22:59.003
- There's no time!
- No! We can't leave without Mack!

22:59.462 --> 23:01.172
- Yo-Yo, no, come on! We got to go!
- No!

23:04.342 --> 23:06.677
Get out of there now! You have to...

23:19.440 --> 23:21.067
You did it.

23:24.404 --> 23:25.655
You did it.

23:36.749 --> 23:37.750
Jemma?

23:41.170 --> 23:42.171
I have Mack.

23:42.338 --> 23:43.506
Let's go home.

24:12.535 --> 24:13.744
My God.

24:14.287 --> 24:15.538
Who did this?

24:16.164 --> 24:17.415
You did.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.667
To stop him from coming after us.

24:20.418 --> 24:21.461
Who?

24:21.878 --> 24:22.879
You.

25:45.628 --> 25:47.380
Looks like we weren't detected
flying in.

25:47.505 --> 25:48.881
We can't stay long.

25:49.006 --> 25:51.008
- Probably shouldn't have come here.
- We have to refuel.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.593
Also, we had no choice.

25:52.802 --> 25:54.136
- Because of that room?
- It's the only place

25:54.303 --> 25:56.556
that can contain
Aida's teleportation ability.

25:57.098 --> 25:59.475
It's outfitted with technology we used
to stop Gordon,

25:59.767 --> 26:02.270
the first guy we encountered
with that particular skill set.

26:02.436 --> 26:05.314
She'll remain inside until we can decide
what we want to do with her.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.567
Why don't we chop off her head
like last time?

26:07.858 --> 26:09.026
You need a volunteer?

26:09.151 --> 26:11.487
Let's take a moment and think about that,
Sweeney Todd.

26:12.321 --> 26:15.199
- She's a real person now and she...
- She saved Mack.

26:15.491 --> 26:18.744
She made herself real in order
to escape Radcliffe's programming, so...

26:19.245 --> 26:21.372
- now maybe she's different.
- I highly doubt that.

26:21.581 --> 26:24.166
People don't name themselves
"Madame Hydra" if they're open-minded.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.836
She did what you said in the Framework,
seems better safe than sorry.

26:27.003 --> 26:28.212
No more killing.

26:29.005 --> 26:32.842
- There's been enough killing.
- Which leads to the next question.

26:33.509 --> 26:35.177
What do we do with Fitz?

26:43.019 --> 26:45.563
What do the two of you remember
of your Framework lives?

26:45.855 --> 26:47.648
As much as I remember about this life.

26:48.065 --> 26:49.942
- The only difference is, I know...
- It wasn't real.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.320
So, it's like you woke up from a dream.

26:52.695 --> 26:53.696
No.

26:53.821 --> 26:55.114
Not a dream, Simmons.

26:56.157 --> 26:57.325
A life.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.829
But this is you, right?

27:02.371 --> 27:03.372
I mean...

27:05.207 --> 27:06.334
does it feel...

27:07.793 --> 27:09.211
as real as...

27:17.345 --> 27:20.181
She's afraid Fitz will be the same guy
he was in the Framework.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.684
No. She's afraid he still loves
someone else.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.337
Aida would've categorised this as irony.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.092
But I see it as poetic.

27:57.134 --> 27:58.386
A simulated view.

27:58.803 --> 28:01.764
My punishment,
now that I can tell the difference.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.351
You did a good thing back there...

28:06.394 --> 28:07.436
saving Mack.

28:08.479 --> 28:09.563
Thank you.

28:11.524 --> 28:13.401
It was the best moment of my life.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.200
Do you think they'll ever be able
to forgive me?

28:23.953 --> 28:27.915
Perhaps they... they need to make me
feel pain to understand theirs.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.128
They may be able to forgive you.

28:35.506 --> 28:37.007
It's me they won't forgive.

28:38.592 --> 28:39.969
They shouldn't.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.221
<i>We both did things we regret.</i>

28:42.805 --> 28:44.640
<i>I know you're struggling
with who you were in there...</i>

28:44.765 --> 28:47.226
<i>No, I'm not.
I'm struggling with who I am.</i>

28:48.811 --> 28:50.062
I did those things...

28:50.938 --> 28:53.858
not some other man or a decoy.

28:56.193 --> 28:57.236
Me.

28:57.528 --> 28:58.904
It was learned behaviour,

28:59.530 --> 29:01.907
programmed into you
by an overbearing father figure.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.367
Just like Ward.

29:08.164 --> 29:10.416
I'm just like Ward.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.512
How can she even
look me in the eye?

29:25.431 --> 29:27.183
<i>Or even stand the sight of me at all?</i>

29:30.853 --> 29:33.063
How can she stomach it?

29:35.524 --> 29:37.693
The memory of seeing me shoot
that woman...

29:50.915 --> 29:52.625
You know, the reason I...

29:54.543 --> 29:57.379
wanted to get closer to you
in the first place was...

30:00.883 --> 30:03.761
to try to understand what you two felt
for each other.

30:04.595 --> 30:05.638
You and...

30:05.971 --> 30:07.056
Jemma.

30:07.807 --> 30:09.391
- And I finally do.
- Yeah.

30:10.559 --> 30:11.727
What we felt...

30:12.728 --> 30:13.813
past tense.

30:14.605 --> 30:16.607
<i>'Cause my future with Jemma's dead.</i>

30:18.442 --> 30:20.152
<i>Killed that, too.</i>

30:23.739 --> 30:25.074
It's okay.

30:25.574 --> 30:26.617
It's okay.

30:27.535 --> 30:29.745
There isn't room in my heart
for two people.

30:30.913 --> 30:32.331
You were everything to me.

30:33.249 --> 30:34.250
I know.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.294
<i>But as devoted as I was to you
in the Framework...</i>

30:38.128 --> 30:39.880
I understand you better now.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.258
How deeply you love.

30:44.260 --> 30:45.970
You do understand me, don't you?

30:46.303 --> 30:47.471
Yes...

30:47.680 --> 30:48.848
Leopold.

30:49.515 --> 30:50.766
Now I do.

30:52.393 --> 30:53.435
It's sad...

30:54.603 --> 30:56.272
but beautiful.

30:57.273 --> 30:59.650
Like a... a pain that...

31:00.442 --> 31:02.695
feels good, if that makes sense.

31:03.070 --> 31:05.906
Yeah. You understand
that my love will never fade.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.326
No, I know. Poor thing.
You're, uh, romantic.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.538
- And there's only room in your heart...
- For her.

31:20.296 --> 31:21.630
What?

31:24.133 --> 31:26.594
- What...
- What do you mean "her"?

31:28.304 --> 31:29.930
- Listen...
- What about me?

31:30.055 --> 31:31.473
Yeah, no, I...

31:31.765 --> 31:33.475
In... I mean, in... in the Framework,

31:33.642 --> 31:35.144
you... you were my whole world...

31:35.686 --> 31:36.979
- but...
- "But"?

31:37.813 --> 31:39.523
- But what, Leopold?
- I...

31:39.982 --> 31:41.650
I just... I only mean that...

31:42.860 --> 31:44.612
- Jemma...
- No!

31:44.737 --> 31:47.364
Okay. All right. Look, calm down,
calm down. We're just talking.

31:47.489 --> 31:49.283
This is... this is a new emotion for you.

31:49.783 --> 31:50.993
No!

31:51.243 --> 31:52.286
Oh, God.

31:53.245 --> 31:59.501
I clawed my way through that world,
worked myself to the bone to have a choice

31:59.793 --> 32:04.173
to have bones and blood and freedom
and love!

32:04.298 --> 32:05.841
And... No!

32:06.425 --> 32:08.010
Okay, please, please...
just... just... just...

32:08.177 --> 32:10.846
Remember... remember that sensation
you had about helping people earlier?

32:11.013 --> 32:13.724
- Let's...let's return to that mood.
- I chose you!

32:14.516 --> 32:17.728
- We need to extract Fitz from that room!
- Hands in the air! Don't move!

32:18.729 --> 32:21.732
Slow down, we're not the enemy here.

32:21.857 --> 32:24.568
- Let's just keep our cool...
- You shut your robot mouth.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.905
Or I'll have these men weld it shut
for you.

32:29.531 --> 32:32.660
- I chose you! Now you choose me!
- That's not how it works.

32:32.785 --> 32:34.870
You can't control everyone anymore!

32:35.204 --> 32:39.375
Watch. We will build a life together,
whether you want to or not!

32:44.630 --> 32:45.923
We're stuck in here?

32:47.383 --> 32:50.219
What did you do?

32:53.639 --> 32:55.724
No!

32:58.268 --> 33:00.562
Fitz, I got you! Go, go, go, go, go!

33:00.938 --> 33:03.857
Grab him!

33:05.734 --> 33:07.236
You're lucky she didn't kill you.

33:07.611 --> 33:09.697
At least the machinery in there will keep
her power contained.

33:09.905 --> 33:11.448
No.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.409
That's not her only power.

33:36.140 --> 33:39.226
- We're not robots, Glenn.
- Yes, they're! They're all robots.

33:39.393 --> 33:42.062
You assume each and every one of them
is a damn C-3PO

33:42.187 --> 33:43.731
unless you hear otherwise from me!

33:44.106 --> 33:45.357
And this one!

33:45.691 --> 33:48.527
If she so much as blinks,
you take her down.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.070
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.406
- Is that really necessary?
- Necessary?

33:53.615 --> 33:54.616
It's essential.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.119
Unless you can explain to me
in 50 words or less

33:57.286 --> 33:59.872
why I found Jeffrey Mace's body washed up
on the beach

33:59.997 --> 34:01.582
with his bones quaked apart,

34:01.832 --> 34:07.379
days after I found this base in flames,
flesh melting off of robot bodies.

34:07.504 --> 34:11.175
Twelve S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in critical
with burns or broken bones.

34:11.425 --> 34:15.137
Three dead! Double hits to the heart
and crushed frickin' skulls!

34:19.516 --> 34:20.893
Can you explain that?

34:21.851 --> 34:22.936
I can try.

34:23.978 --> 34:26.148
Wait. Every...
everybody should get out.

34:27.024 --> 34:28.859
- Leave me here alone.
- Not a chance.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.321
She can't be stopped.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.491
Freeze! Right there!

34:36.492 --> 34:39.369
All right, guys. It's never too late
to start a conversation.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.668
No, no! Don't shoot! That was not us!
That thing is not a friendly!

34:46.752 --> 34:48.170
- We've got to get you out of here.
- No.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.172
No. Wait. Wait!

34:51.507 --> 34:54.176
And then the base under the oil rig fell
into the sea.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.596
You expect me to believe a word of that?

34:57.888 --> 34:59.807
<i>She's everywhere!</i>

34:59.932 --> 35:02.184
<i>Let's go!</i>

35:02.392 --> 35:06.230
What does that mean, Coulson?
"She's everywhere." Who's everywhere?

35:06.730 --> 35:08.690
Where's that Speedy Gonzalez girl?

35:09.316 --> 35:10.609
Who's attacking us?

35:12.027 --> 35:13.403
Aida got out.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.743
- We should be good here.
- No!

35:20.160 --> 35:21.578
She'll find us.

35:40.556 --> 35:42.432
Get out of here!

35:44.476 --> 35:45.686
No! No!

35:45.894 --> 35:48.355
No! Wait! Leave me!

35:48.647 --> 35:50.524
You can't stop her!

35:57.698 --> 35:59.575
May! Take off now!

35:59.992 --> 36:02.578
We have to move!
If she can find us, she'll kill us all!

36:02.703 --> 36:05.747
- Davis had her down for the count.
- They won't listen to me!

36:06.123 --> 36:08.208
She can't be stopped!

36:09.501 --> 36:11.253
May! May!

36:11.670 --> 36:14.381
You're the only other person
that knows about the Inhumans we tested.

36:17.801 --> 36:18.927
Hey!

36:19.386 --> 36:20.387
Try it.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.641
Let's see what happens.

36:25.267 --> 36:26.518
Davis...

36:26.977 --> 36:28.228
We already left him.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.274
I'm sorry, but he's already dead.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.457
If you drop your guns,
you can come with us.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.083
I don't suggest staying,

36:50.209 --> 36:52.002
but the <i>Zephyr's</i> leaving
with or without you.

36:54.671 --> 36:55.881
Fall back!

37:05.098 --> 37:09.686
Search the base for any other threats
and any bodies!

38:20.882 --> 38:23.677
- May needs to keep us on the move.
- Or Aida will be on us like a flash.

38:23.885 --> 38:25.137
Even Yo-Yo couldn't...

38:27.472 --> 38:29.391
Wait a minute.
Where was Yo-Yo during that standoff?

38:30.017 --> 38:31.727
No.

38:37.190 --> 38:38.317
No.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.363
Yo-Yo has no idea what she's in for.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.657
For that matter, neither do we.

38:49.036 --> 38:51.371
It's called heartbreak, <i>kroshka.</i>

38:51.955 --> 38:54.666
Not even your new powers can repair it.

38:56.543 --> 38:58.253
Only time can heal that wound.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.089
Go on.

39:09.473 --> 39:12.100
To be human is to suffer.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.271
You are far from human.

39:16.897 --> 39:18.273
I've read that book.

39:18.774 --> 39:22.152
We both know there are things
beyond this universe.

39:22.944 --> 39:25.489
And you may, in fact, be one of them.

39:25.864 --> 39:31.119
I am nothing but torn and twisted insides!

39:32.079 --> 39:33.497
I can't stand it.

39:35.415 --> 39:36.666
I don't want it.

39:42.089 --> 39:44.466
I can make you feel something else.

39:47.010 --> 39:49.137
That book helps build worlds.

39:50.806 --> 39:54.976
My plan will rebuild the world
that you have grown accustomed to...

39:55.936 --> 40:00.107
- one where Inhumans are hunted.
- And we control the rest.

40:00.482 --> 40:03.026
It doesn't hurt
that both of us are unstoppable.

40:03.777 --> 40:05.237
But your plan is flawed.

40:14.704 --> 40:15.997
It's too clean.

40:19.960 --> 40:22.421
I want them to suffer.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.259
Now...

40:30.178 --> 40:31.721
make me feel something else.

40:56.872 --> 40:58.331
All better now?

41:10.135 --> 41:11.595
We lost three men, sir.

41:13.096 --> 41:14.181
To what?

41:14.306 --> 41:17.809
I'm not sure. There's nothing else here.
The place is empty.

41:18.310 --> 41:19.978
All right. Clear out.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.522
We'll have Hazmat come in at dawn.

42:22.290 --> 42:24.292
No!
