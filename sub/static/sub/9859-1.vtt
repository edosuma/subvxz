01:04.164 --> 01:05.456
Ruth?

01:15.509 --> 01:16.759
Ruth?

01:46.790 --> 01:48.416
Where's my wife?

01:49.418 --> 01:51.919
Mr. Guttman!
You can't be sneaking up on me like that!

01:52.588 --> 01:54.255
Where is my wife? Where is Ruth?

01:56.258 --> 01:57.884
I'm sorry, Mr. Guttman,

01:59.261 --> 02:01.554
your wife passed away about a week ago.

02:04.641 --> 02:05.808
Ah.

02:17.821 --> 02:19.572
I'm sorry. Who are you?

02:19.698 --> 02:21.532
My name's Paula.

02:21.658 --> 02:23.910
I was Mrs. Guttman's nursing aide.

02:24.661 --> 02:27.246
Your family asked me to stay on
for another week or two.

02:29.333 --> 02:30.583
Let's get some breakfast.

02:31.335 --> 02:33.336
You'll be feeling better after breakfast.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.004
Where are your shoes?

02:35.631 --> 02:37.798
Hold on, let me get you some slippers.
Tell you what.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.634
Trade your hat for some slippers, okay?

02:39.760 --> 02:41.344
All right. Now come in.

02:44.890 --> 02:46.515
- Good morning, Zev.
- Good morning.

02:46.642 --> 02:49.477
I hope you're not too hungry.
Breakfast is crummy as usual.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.395
That's okay. I'm not too hungry.

02:52.522 --> 02:54.857
That's Cele.
She was friends with your wife.

02:54.983 --> 02:57.485
I know who she is. I know who she is.

03:06.495 --> 03:08.371
Could you give us a minute, please?

03:08.705 --> 03:10.748
Oh, no problem...

03:11.625 --> 03:12.583
Max.

03:12.709 --> 03:15.044
You don't have to tell me everyone's name.

03:22.386 --> 03:25.554
Tonight is the last night
sitting shiva for Ruth, yes?

03:27.724 --> 03:30.351
Do you remember what you said you would do

03:31.019 --> 03:32.979
when Ruth died?

03:36.400 --> 03:37.566
No.

03:38.902 --> 03:40.528
It's okay. It's okay.

03:41.822 --> 03:42.905
I...

03:43.657 --> 03:45.032
wrote everything down

03:45.742 --> 03:46.951
so you...

03:47.077 --> 03:48.536
could remember.

03:49.746 --> 03:50.955
(COUGHS)

03:55.919 --> 03:57.294
Come on, Mr. Rosenbaum.

03:57.421 --> 03:59.296
(CONTINUES COUGHING)

03:59.423 --> 04:01.090
(ALL PRAYING)

04:15.480 --> 04:16.647
Darling.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.692
Do you know when this picture was taken?

04:20.944 --> 04:24.405
It's from their wedding day.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.574
1946.

04:27.117 --> 04:29.118
Did you meet nanny in Germany?

04:30.454 --> 04:31.871
Uh, no, no.

04:32.706 --> 04:36.125
I met her in America. I met her...

04:37.002 --> 04:38.461
Coney...

04:39.713 --> 04:41.839
- Coney Island.
- Yeah.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.800
Why don't you show this
to your brother, eh?

04:47.137 --> 04:48.804
Adam, look at this!

04:51.683 --> 04:54.602
Here. Put this away in your pocket.

04:56.521 --> 04:57.605
Now,

04:58.148 --> 04:59.482
stand up.

05:00.609 --> 05:02.068
Tell everyone you're tired,

05:03.653 --> 05:06.822
and go read it alone.

05:07.449 --> 05:08.657
Alone.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.493
You're tired.

05:10.869 --> 05:12.036
Yeah, yeah.

05:12.162 --> 05:13.829
Yeah. Good.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.505
Forgive me, I...

05:22.631 --> 05:26.008
I'm a little tired,
I think I should go to bed.

05:26.134 --> 05:28.135
Yeah. Okay, Dad.

05:29.805 --> 05:31.013
It's been a long week.

05:32.432 --> 05:33.641
Yeah.

06:08.927 --> 06:11.053
(DOOR CREAKING)

06:14.641 --> 06:16.725
(DOOR CLOSING)

06:32.576 --> 06:34.827
- Penn Station, right?
- Yeah.

06:54.139 --> 06:55.514
CONDUCTOR: Last call!

06:55.640 --> 06:57.725
49 Lake Shore Limited!

06:57.851 --> 06:59.226
Last call!

07:00.187 --> 07:03.105
Last call, 49 Lake Shore Limited!

07:03.732 --> 07:05.107
(SIGHING)

07:08.111 --> 07:09.945
Is that your mother?

07:10.655 --> 07:11.822
Yeah.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.700
She's not coming with you?

07:15.952 --> 07:17.786
No. I'm going to see my dad.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.122
Oh.

07:21.625 --> 07:24.084
So, you're traveling all alone?

07:24.211 --> 07:26.962
I'm not alone.
My brothers are right over there.

07:28.632 --> 07:29.757
Oh?

07:30.133 --> 07:31.634
Oh, I see.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.222
Are you going to Cleveland too?

07:36.723 --> 07:37.723
Yeah.

07:37.849 --> 07:39.642
Why don't you fly? It's faster.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.771
I don't know. (CHUCKLES)

07:44.606 --> 07:45.773
That's not a good reason.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.191
(LAUGHING)

07:47.317 --> 07:49.693
You're a real whipper snapper, aren't you?

07:49.819 --> 07:51.153
Why don't you fly to Cleveland?

07:51.905 --> 07:53.656
Three plane tickets is too expensive.

07:54.199 --> 07:55.824
That's what my mom and dad said.

07:56.326 --> 07:58.077
Well, that is a good reason.

07:59.996 --> 08:03.123
I don't fly because
my friend told me to take the train

08:03.250 --> 08:06.752
in the letter he wrote to me.

08:10.215 --> 08:11.924
I guess that's a good reason, too.

08:12.050 --> 08:13.842
- (CHUCKLES)
- My name is Tyler.

08:15.011 --> 08:16.345
Nice to meet you, Tyler.

08:17.180 --> 08:18.806
My name's Zev.

08:19.641 --> 08:20.933
That's a strange name.

08:21.059 --> 08:23.852
In Hebrew, it means "Wolf."

08:23.979 --> 08:26.230
- Cool!
- (LAUGHS)

08:34.072 --> 08:36.365
MAX: I have planned everything for you.

08:37.616 --> 08:40.327
You must follow these steps precisely.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.873
Cross them off as you
accomplish each task.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.378
We've notified the police
and they've issued

08:50.005 --> 08:52.798
a silver alert as well as a reverse 911

08:52.924 --> 08:55.551
to the community, our...
our staff is doing all that we can.

08:55.677 --> 08:57.970
- It's upsetting.
- I just can't believe

08:59.014 --> 09:00.180
this is happening.

09:00.307 --> 09:03.058
I can't tell you how sorry we all are.

09:03.893 --> 09:05.894
We do our best
to keep an eye on everybody,

09:06.021 --> 09:07.855
but... I'm sure you can understand.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.940
WOMAN:
Is there anything we can do to help?

09:10.692 --> 09:12.651
Besides paying you to lose people?

09:13.403 --> 09:15.070
Does your father have a credit card?

09:15.196 --> 09:17.364
You can tell them
to call you if he uses it.

09:18.074 --> 09:19.241
(SCOFFS)

09:21.745 --> 09:22.870
Listen.

09:23.913 --> 09:28.292
Your mother's nursing aid told me that
your dad's been very confused lately.

09:28.418 --> 09:30.794
Yeah, yeah.
That's because he has dementia.

09:30.920 --> 09:33.714
And that's why my mother
brought them here in the first place.

09:33.840 --> 09:37.426
I understand that. However, it's very
common after the death of a spouse

09:37.761 --> 09:40.846
for more signs
of neurocognitive disorders to emerge.

09:42.098 --> 09:44.224
Have you noticed that your father's
been having mood swings?

09:45.435 --> 09:47.936
And he rarely plays the piano anymore?

09:50.023 --> 09:52.900
I've noticed a few things, Charles.

09:55.403 --> 09:56.820
I guess we were...

09:56.946 --> 10:00.282
so busy with your mom
that I just dismissed them.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.788
Let me reassure you,
we'll have him back here before you know it.

10:05.914 --> 10:07.748
In these situations,

10:08.458 --> 10:10.084
people never wander too far.

10:12.712 --> 10:14.129
- (BOTTLES RATTLING)
- (THUD)

10:15.215 --> 10:16.757
Ruth?

10:19.302 --> 10:20.803
Ruth?

10:24.140 --> 10:25.349
Adam?

10:25.475 --> 10:27.267
Where is your grandmother?

10:29.479 --> 10:30.896
Adam?

10:31.022 --> 10:32.439
Where is your grandmother?

10:33.316 --> 10:34.900
Were you talking to me, Zev?

10:35.235 --> 10:37.069
I asked you where your grandmother is.

10:38.488 --> 10:41.281
One is in New York. One is in Ohio.

10:43.868 --> 10:45.202
Where is your sister?

10:46.287 --> 10:47.496
I don't have a sister.

10:49.124 --> 10:50.916
Stop playing with that thing.

10:51.334 --> 10:52.292
Answer me.

10:54.379 --> 10:56.338
Are... are you okay, Zev?

10:58.383 --> 10:59.800
Where are we?

10:59.926 --> 11:01.176
We're on a train.

11:01.970 --> 11:03.262
To where?

11:03.388 --> 11:04.888
Cleveland.

11:06.015 --> 11:07.015
Cleveland?

11:08.268 --> 11:09.977
You're going to see a friend.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.353
What friend?

11:12.480 --> 11:14.940
The one who wrote you
the letter in your pocket.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.113
Can I have my PSP back?

11:40.258 --> 11:42.050
Ruth is dead.

11:48.558 --> 11:50.058
Zev,

11:50.894 --> 11:53.020
I'm going to sit with my brothers
for a little bit.

12:31.601 --> 12:33.268
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

12:33.394 --> 12:36.063
Hi. Uh... My son there
said that you were sitting

12:36.189 --> 12:38.607
next to him on the train
and that you seemed a little confused.

12:38.942 --> 12:40.776
Oh, yes, that.

12:40.902 --> 12:42.611
- I'm sorry about that.
- Oh, no, no, no.

12:42.946 --> 12:44.404
There's no need to apologize. We...

12:44.989 --> 12:47.741
- just want to make sure you're okay.
- Oh, yes, I'm okay.

12:47.867 --> 12:50.035
Thank you. I'm okay.

12:50.161 --> 12:51.995
Um... You need help getting somewhere?

12:52.121 --> 12:55.082
No, no. Someone will be meeting me here.

12:55.917 --> 12:58.001
My friend said that he had a...

12:58.127 --> 12:59.962
sign with my name on it.

13:00.088 --> 13:02.339
Okay. Well, we'll help you find him.

13:03.967 --> 13:05.217
The cars are just down here.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.139
Is your last name Guttman?

13:11.599 --> 13:12.933
Yeah.

13:13.434 --> 13:14.977
Looks like you're riding in style.

13:16.521 --> 13:18.272
TYLER: Bye, Zev.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.566
Goodbye. Goodbye.

13:21.317 --> 13:22.442
Let's go, boys.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.194
- Mr. Guttman?
- Yeah.

13:25.029 --> 13:26.154
Good.

13:39.294 --> 13:40.669
- Good evening.
- Evening.

13:41.462 --> 13:42.838
How can I help you?

13:42.964 --> 13:46.133
My friend recommended your shop to me.

13:46.509 --> 13:49.011
Well, tell your friend
we appreciate the recommendation.

13:49.137 --> 13:51.305
- What are you looking to pick up?
- Oh...

13:52.015 --> 13:53.682
Something small.

13:55.018 --> 13:55.892
Sure thing. Okay.

13:56.019 --> 13:57.936
- Can I see your driver's license?
- Yeah.

14:06.154 --> 14:07.154
Yeah...

14:08.281 --> 14:09.489
Okay.

14:10.074 --> 14:12.242
Beachwood. Nice town.

14:12.368 --> 14:13.952
Yes. But, um...

14:14.287 --> 14:15.579
We've moved.

14:16.497 --> 14:18.498
We live closer to my son.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.960
What are you doing with my license?

14:22.086 --> 14:26.048
I'm entering your information
into the FBI background check database.

14:26.174 --> 14:27.341
Oh.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.259
What do they look for?

14:29.677 --> 14:31.887
A bunch of stuff.
Whether you're a convicted felon,

14:32.013 --> 14:33.597
if you've been involved
in a crime of violence,

14:33.723 --> 14:35.307
dishonorably discharged from the army,

14:35.433 --> 14:38.393
mentally competent.
If you've got more than one DUI offense

14:38.519 --> 14:40.437
in the last five years,
if you're a fugitive,

14:40.563 --> 14:42.356
- or currently charged with a felony.
- Fugitive?

14:43.316 --> 14:44.941
Yeah, like, if you're
running from the law.

14:45.068 --> 14:47.194
- (CHUCKLES)
- Do I look like I can run?

14:49.238 --> 14:50.489
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

14:51.449 --> 14:54.242
Uh, okay. Let me show you
some of our smaller handguns.

14:54.369 --> 14:57.371
We got everything.
SIG Sauers, 1911s, Glocks,

14:57.497 --> 14:59.039
single action, double action.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.249
- Sir, do you know much about guns?
- Um...

15:02.460 --> 15:04.628
- No. Why?
- It's all right.

15:04.754 --> 15:06.254
We get all types in here.

15:06.756 --> 15:08.340
Uh, okay. Beginners...

15:09.092 --> 15:10.467
usually go with a .22.

15:10.593 --> 15:12.678
It's light. Easy to use.
Very little recoil.

15:13.721 --> 15:15.263
(MUTTERING)

15:15.390 --> 15:17.641
I think that's what my friend suggested.

15:17.767 --> 15:19.476
Okay. In my opinion,

15:19.602 --> 15:22.521
you might as well get yourself a BB gun
if you get a .22.

15:23.231 --> 15:27.192
Look, I'm not trying
to give you the hard sell, but $500 more,

15:27.318 --> 15:30.404
you can get yourself a gun
with real stopping power.

15:31.489 --> 15:34.658
Now this is a 9mm Glock 17.

15:34.784 --> 15:37.035
Glock? It is German, no?

15:37.161 --> 15:39.579
You're in the right neighborhood.
Manufactured in Austria.

15:40.415 --> 15:43.375
That's the most popular
law enforcement pistol in the world. Okay?

15:43.501 --> 15:45.961
It's got very little recoil
so probably won't hurt your hand

15:46.087 --> 15:47.921
but it'll definitely hurt the intruder.

15:48.047 --> 15:50.590
Is it easy to use?

15:50.717 --> 15:52.175
I hope!

15:52.593 --> 15:53.719
Yeah, it's simple.

15:54.470 --> 15:55.804
Yeah, but...

15:56.139 --> 15:58.265
Would you mind, could you...

15:58.391 --> 16:00.267
write down the instructions for me?

16:02.478 --> 16:05.021
Uh, sure. I mean,
I can show you how to use it.

16:05.148 --> 16:08.817
No, that would be good.
But please, write it down for me.

16:09.819 --> 16:11.528
Sometimes I forget things.

16:17.493 --> 16:21.663
Yeah, we all do, right? That's no problem.

16:21.789 --> 16:23.540
Okay, you're good to go.

Rudy Kurlander, he lives here?

01:13:20.913 --> 01:13:23.665
- Yes.
- Can I speak with him?

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:26.668
- He's still sleeping.
- Oh.

01:13:26.794 --> 01:13:31.089
Well, could I wait for him to... wake up?

01:13:32.091 --> 01:13:33.550
It's important.

01:13:34.635 --> 01:13:35.760
What's this about?

01:13:35.887 --> 01:13:37.971
Well, it's private.

01:13:38.097 --> 01:13:41.141
And he knows me, he knows me.
I knew him a long time ago.

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:46.605
- Come on in.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

01:13:49.233 --> 01:13:52.694
- Do you want a cup of coffee, Mr...
- Guttman.

01:13:53.571 --> 01:13:55.614
Yes, coffee would be nice. Thank you.

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:59.534
- Uh, just black.
- Take a seat in the living room.

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:00.952
I've got a pot brewing.

01:14:15.301 --> 01:14:17.886
That's from our family reunion
a couple years ago.

01:14:18.971 --> 01:14:20.430
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:22.265
You have a big family.

01:14:23.017 --> 01:14:25.310
My father likes to say
he fielded a soccer team.

01:14:25.645 --> 01:14:27.020
- (LAUGHING)
- I'm his youngest.

01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:29.189
How old was your mother?

01:14:29.815 --> 01:14:31.983
She was a lot younger.
It was his second marriage.

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:36.655
- Thank you.
- Can I ask you a question, Mr. Guttman?

01:14:38.157 --> 01:14:40.283
Does you being here
have to do with Auschwitz?

01:14:42.203 --> 01:14:43.203
Yes.

01:14:44.747 --> 01:14:46.915
My father's not gonna want
to talk about that.

01:14:47.041 --> 01:14:48.333
Oh.

01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:51.169
I understand.

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:55.840
Would you like to join us
for breakfast, Mr. Guttman?

01:14:55.967 --> 01:14:57.217
I'm making baked apple pancakes.

01:14:57.343 --> 01:14:59.678
I'm not very hungry. Thank you very much.

01:15:00.263 --> 01:15:02.347
I won't bother you for long.

01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:04.933
Are you sure? It's an old family recipe.

01:15:05.059 --> 01:15:08.853
Mmm. Yes, I am sure,
but thank you just the same.

01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:12.065
If you'd excuse me, I am just going
to run up and tell Dad you're here.

01:15:12.191 --> 01:15:13.608
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:21.075 --> 01:15:22.826
(PLAYING TUNE)

01:15:27.957 --> 01:15:29.749
(DOOR OPENING)

01:15:34.714 --> 01:15:36.006
Uh, who are you?

01:15:36.382 --> 01:15:38.591
Oh, I am Zev.

01:15:38.718 --> 01:15:40.010
- Hi, Zev.
- Inge.

01:15:42.346 --> 01:15:43.888
(CONTINUES PLAYING TUNE)

01:15:45.391 --> 01:15:46.391
Who is that?

01:15:47.393 --> 01:15:51.187
Well, it's an old friend
of your grandfather.

01:16:46.827 --> 01:16:48.078
You like Wagner?

01:16:50.956 --> 01:16:55.043
Yes. I have always loved Wagner.

01:16:56.003 --> 01:17:00.465
My daughter said someone I knew
from Auschwitz was here.

01:17:02.176 --> 01:17:04.803
But a survivor should not like Wagner, no?

01:17:04.929 --> 01:17:08.098
- (CHUCKLES)
- You can't hate music.

01:17:10.810 --> 01:17:14.312
I, uh, didn't recognize your face
in those pictures.

01:17:15.815 --> 01:17:16.815
But...

01:17:18.109 --> 01:17:21.152
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:24.072
Your voice...

01:17:28.244 --> 01:17:29.828
has not changed.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.836
(GERMAN)
I knew you would come to find me one day.

01:17:39.213 --> 01:17:40.505
Zev's your friend, Poppy?

01:17:41.132 --> 01:17:43.341
Inge, please go back into the kitchen.

01:17:44.343 --> 01:17:47.178
My friend and I need
to discuss some things.

01:17:50.224 --> 01:17:52.475
I have not forgotten you.

01:17:53.519 --> 01:17:56.187
Please... let us go outside.

01:17:57.481 --> 01:18:01.151
I do not want my family to hear...
what we have to say.

01:18:07.366 --> 01:18:08.908
It has been a long time...

01:18:10.494 --> 01:18:13.037
since anyone knew who I was.

01:18:15.249 --> 01:18:17.459
I cannot even remember when.

01:18:20.546 --> 01:18:24.382
Over the years people have looked at me

01:18:25.217 --> 01:18:29.888
and I think they know, but they never do.

01:18:32.224 --> 01:18:37.020
Or maybe they were just
too scared to say anything.

01:18:40.065 --> 01:18:45.403
Sometimes, I come out here
and speak my name.

01:18:48.407 --> 01:18:50.241
I talk to myself.

01:18:51.577 --> 01:18:54.204
I remind myself of who I was.

01:18:57.458 --> 01:19:01.419
It is the only way to know I existed...

01:19:03.130 --> 01:19:05.840
before I became who I am now.

01:19:07.384 --> 01:19:13.306
Well, living a lie is not a life.

01:19:16.101 --> 01:19:18.937
I always knew you would find me.

01:19:24.944 --> 01:19:26.402
It has been too long.

01:19:27.363 --> 01:19:29.072
We are old men now.

01:19:30.449 --> 01:19:35.119
Take your hands off of me, Otto.

01:19:37.957 --> 01:19:38.915
Excuse me?

01:19:39.041 --> 01:19:42.168
I said, "Take your hands off of me."

01:19:44.046 --> 01:19:47.549
(SCOFFS) You called me Otto.

01:19:48.133 --> 01:19:49.217
I think you're confused.

01:19:49.343 --> 01:19:53.346
No, your name is Otto Wallisch.

01:19:53.472 --> 01:19:57.141
You were a Blockführer at Auschwitz.

01:19:57.601 --> 01:20:01.104
And you killed my family.

01:20:03.274 --> 01:20:04.482
Are you crazy?

01:20:07.111 --> 01:20:12.448
You've lived a lie for so long
you've convinced yourself it is true.

01:20:14.076 --> 01:20:15.076
I...

01:20:17.663 --> 01:20:19.205
I do not understand.

01:20:19.331 --> 01:20:20.373
Let me help you...

01:20:22.501 --> 01:20:24.252
understand.

01:20:32.136 --> 01:20:33.136
(DOORBELL RINGING)

01:20:34.388 --> 01:20:36.306
It's like we're running a hotel.

01:20:38.058 --> 01:20:40.101
Go tell Pop-Pop breakfast is ready.

01:20:43.981 --> 01:20:45.815
- Who is it?
- My name's Charles Guttman.

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:47.692
I think my father's here.

01:20:48.193 --> 01:20:50.570
Hi, I'm so sorry to bother you,

01:20:50.696 --> 01:20:54.907
but I was told that a taxi dropped
my dad off here a little while ago.

01:20:55.034 --> 01:20:57.076
Yeah, he's outside with my father.

01:20:58.537 --> 01:20:59.537
Thank God.

01:21:00.664 --> 01:21:03.708
(SCOFFS) He's been missing for a week.

01:21:04.043 --> 01:21:05.168
Missing?

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:09.714
- I had no idea. Come on.
- Thank you.

01:21:22.353 --> 01:21:24.270
- Dad?
- Oh, my God.

01:21:24.396 --> 01:21:27.190
- Mommy?
- Please do not be frightened.

01:21:27.316 --> 01:21:28.316
Don't be scared.

01:21:28.651 --> 01:21:32.570
Dad, why don't you, uh, lower the gun?

01:21:33.739 --> 01:21:35.198
- Charles?
- Yeah.

01:21:36.241 --> 01:21:38.242
- What are you doing here?
- Uh...

01:21:39.244 --> 01:21:40.745
Dad, put the gun down.

01:21:41.413 --> 01:21:44.499
- Put down the gun, Dad.
- No. No.

01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:47.251
Not until he tells the truth.

01:21:50.381 --> 01:21:51.756
Why are you doing this?

01:21:52.466 --> 01:21:54.342
Tell them who you are.

01:21:54.468 --> 01:21:57.136
Please, stop this madness.

01:21:57.262 --> 01:21:59.597
Tell them what you did.

01:22:00.015 --> 01:22:02.475
- Leave them alone, please.
- English!

01:22:02.601 --> 01:22:03.643
I beg you.

01:22:04.144 --> 01:22:06.270
I want them to understand
what you're saying.

01:22:06.772 --> 01:22:08.356
KRISTIN: Dad, what is he talking about?

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:11.776
Do not listen to him. He is crazy!

01:22:12.778 --> 01:22:13.778
Ach so?

01:22:14.613 --> 01:22:16.280
(GASPS)

01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:18.324
You have a very easy choice.

01:22:19.201 --> 01:22:21.369
You can tell the truth and she lives,

01:22:21.495 --> 01:22:24.163
or you can lie and watch her die.

01:22:24.289 --> 01:22:25.248
You have three seconds.

01:22:25.374 --> 01:22:26.332
- One.
- Please stop.

01:22:26.458 --> 01:22:28.251
- Two.
- Please, just shoot me.

01:22:28.377 --> 01:22:29.335
- Dad, stop it!
- Three.

01:22:29.461 --> 01:22:30.503
Okay. Okay.

01:22:31.797 --> 01:22:33.339
(SOBBING) Okay.

01:22:42.474 --> 01:22:44.809
During the war,

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.271
I was not a prisoner.

01:22:48.814 --> 01:22:49.814
Louder.

01:22:52.484 --> 01:22:54.777
- During the war I was not a prisoner.
- Louder!

01:22:56.155 --> 01:22:58.823

I was SS.

01:23:17.092 --> 01:23:19.385
I was a Blockführer at Auschwitz.

01:23:23.682 --> 01:23:24.682
Yes.

- You killed people, Poppy?
- How many people did you kill?

01:23:31.398 --> 01:23:32.398
I don't know.

01:23:33.567 --> 01:23:34.609
Many.

I haven't lied in 70 years.

You are Otto Wallisch.

01:24:30.332 --> 01:24:34.502
I am Kunibert Sturm.
We were both Blockführers.

No... (STAMMERS)

01:24:38.257 --> 01:24:39.549
I was a prisoner.

Look at your arm.

01:24:42.553 --> 01:24:47.223
You are number 98814. I am 98813.

01:24:49.226 --> 01:24:54.647
We tattooed each other.
It was our only way to escape.

01:25:10.831 --> 01:25:11.914
Dad?

01:25:13.792 --> 01:25:14.917
Is that true?

01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:19.255
No, it's all lies. It's all lies.

01:25:26.638 --> 01:25:28.222
How could you forget?

01:25:29.433 --> 01:25:32.560
You took the name Zev
because it means wolf.

01:25:34.271 --> 01:25:36.981
You said we were wolves!

REPORTER: Right now, we're still waiting to
hear from the Lake Tahoe Police Department.

They haven't spoken to reporters

But they have assured us
that we will hear from them in some way

within the hour.

Residents, though, are,
as you can imagine, just stunned.

01:26:31.745 --> 01:26:35.331
I've spoken to some people
who do not want to comment on camera.

01:26:35.457 --> 01:26:38.250
I did speak to one,
though, who told me that...

01:26:38.377 --> 01:26:42.713
- Poor Zev.
- Tragic. Absolutely tragic.

01:26:42.839 --> 01:26:45.383
He couldn't have known what he was doing.

01:26:49.596 --> 01:26:52.431

The man he killed

01:27:04.528 --> 01:27:09.073
was named Kunibert Sturm.

01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:13.744
And Zev's name

01:27:16.415 --> 01:27:19.625
was Otto Wallisch.

01:27:23.422 --> 01:27:25.339
They were the men who...

01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:30.553
