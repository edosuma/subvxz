(WHOOSH)

00:49.407 --> 00:51.443
All right? Anyone serving or what?

00:51.607 --> 00:54.326
(WOMAN) With you in a minute, luv.

00:54.487 --> 00:56.045
(BABY CRIES)

01:09.687 --> 01:14.363
- Hello, Frank. What can I get you?
- Look what I found under the pool table.

01:15.767 --> 01:17.564
- Any note?
- No, nothin'.

01:19.007 --> 01:20.725
Oh!

01:22.327 --> 01:26.240
They've written its name on the side here.

01:26.447 --> 01:28.677
"Our Rob or Ross."

01:30.007 --> 01:34.444
Look how it's spelt. They must've been
thicker than a ticket tout's wad.

01:34.647 --> 01:38.435
- Couldn't even decide on a name.
- Oh, poor little mite.

01:38.607 --> 01:42.395
I wonder what'll become of him?
Somethin' terrible, no doubt.

02:05.527 --> 02:08.405
I hate doing that! I hate doing that!

02:12.887 --> 02:14.639
(TINKLING)

02:16.567 --> 02:18.000
Smeg!

02:18.167 --> 02:20.158
I've just sneezed out me cap!

02:21.487 --> 02:24.604
Just thought I'd change your linen
before you turn in for the night, sir.

02:24.807 --> 02:26.877
Kryten, I've lost me cap.

02:27.087 --> 02:30.796
No, here it is, sir. I've just finished
giving it its monthly scrape.

02:31.007 --> 02:34.556
My tooth cap, the one you made
from the skeleton in medi-bay.

02:34.767 --> 02:38.362
- Oh, I see.
- Hey! Here it is.

02:38.527 --> 02:41.678
I need some glue to stick it in.
I've just got that needly, pointy thing.

02:41.887 --> 02:45.357
- Let me see.
- No, it's all needly, pointy and disgusting.

02:45.567 --> 02:49.765
Let me see, sir.
I'm a mechanoid. I won't be revolted.

02:49.927 --> 02:51.246
OK.

02:51.887 --> 02:54.321
Oh, my God! It's hideous!

02:54.527 --> 02:56.518
(GIGGLES)

02:56.687 --> 02:58.678
Yeah, very funny. Just fix it.

02:58.847 --> 03:01.156
It'll take an hour to prepare
some dental adhesive.

03:01.367 --> 03:04.120
Give me some wood glue.
You can redo it in the morning.

03:04.287 --> 03:08.997
Wood glue? Are you sure, sir?
Don't get your lips glued together.

03:10.127 --> 03:15.360
Oh, incidentally, I just found some
old clothes in one of the storage lockers.

03:15.527 --> 03:17.961
Hey! I need a dressing gown.

03:18.167 --> 03:22.638
Well, that's what I thought.
I thought if I remove the trim,

03:22.807 --> 03:27.005
let it out a little bit,
obviously dye it, it could be just dandy.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.203
Yeah. Nice one, Kryts.

03:30.367 --> 03:33.882
Perhaps I could take the necessary
measurements now, sir?

03:35.047 --> 03:37.163
I wonder why guys have nostril hair.

03:37.327 --> 03:39.158
I think it's nature's way of telling you

03:39.327 --> 03:42.160
it's time to buy a flat cap
and a pair of driving gloves, sir.

03:42.327 --> 03:45.285
Worst are those guys who just let it grow.

03:45.447 --> 03:48.883
They look like they've got half a loo brush
lodged up each nostril.

03:49.047 --> 03:51.242
They look like those machines
that shine shoes.

03:51.407 --> 03:53.967
Curious, isn't it, that most women
aren't similarly afflicted.

03:54.127 --> 03:56.766
Obviously, I'm excluding women
who work in Oxfam shops.

03:57.567 --> 04:00.684
Pain: It evens itself out, doesn't it?

04:00.847 --> 04:04.920
Women have the agony
of childbirth and we have... this.

04:09.407 --> 04:11.398
(WHINES) They don't know they're born!

04:24.407 --> 04:29.481
What is wrong with me? Now I've got
a box of floss attached to me face!

04:31.167 --> 04:34.000
Hey! Nice outfit!

04:34.167 --> 04:36.840
- Did you come in here for a reason?
- Oh, yeah!

04:37.007 --> 04:41.319
Something's showing up on the long-range
scan which is weird with a capital "WE".

04:41.527 --> 04:44.439
- Can you be a tad more scientific?
- Come again?

04:44.607 --> 04:47.485
Is it a wibbly thing or a swirly thing?

04:47.647 --> 04:52.721
At this early stage, I'd hate to commit myself
and wind up looking a fool. See for yourself.

04:53.487 --> 04:56.604
Wibbly thing or swirly thing...

04:56.767 --> 04:59.156
and he refuses to commit himself?

04:59.727 --> 05:03.083
He's losing it. He really is.

05:08.487 --> 05:13.003
It's some kind of power surge causing a
major disturbance in the fabric of space-time.

05:13.207 --> 05:17.041
It's also causing a major disturbance
in the fabric of my pants!

05:17.247 --> 05:20.125
- It's almost like a tear.
- Perhaps a temporal rip.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.517
I'm gonna turn this tub around
and try and outrun it.

05:22.727 --> 05:26.845
Get real, man. That thing up there's going
faster than a copy of "Hello!" in a nunnery.

05:30.127 --> 05:34.086
Suggest we treat it like a tidal wave and
head straight for the eye of the storm.

05:34.287 --> 05:36.084
Are you sure about that?

05:36.247 --> 05:39.956
Because intestines and a suit won't work
without colon-coloured accessories.

05:40.127 --> 05:42.118
I need to know - should I change?

05:42.287 --> 05:46.121
Cat, go for it, man. The eye of the storm.

05:53.447 --> 05:56.280
We seem to be through the worst of it...

05:56.447 --> 06:00.042
but I'm picking up some kind of sub-space
energy disturbance on the engineering deck.

06:00.247 --> 06:02.602
You're right, sir. It's off the scale.

06:02.807 --> 06:06.641
Now, for a sub-space energy disturbance,
I'm dressed perfectly.

06:06.807 --> 06:09.367
Let's check it out.

06:18.447 --> 06:20.244
According to the psi-scan,

06:20.407 --> 06:24.002
the membrane between two realities
has temporarily collapsed.

06:24.167 --> 06:28.126
This is some kind of hyperway
through non-space to a parallel dimension.

06:29.447 --> 06:31.756
Let's have a goosey.

06:42.207 --> 06:44.357
(TEARING AND WHOOSHING)

06:44.527 --> 06:48.486
Careful, sir. The linkway's about
as stable as an Italian taxi driver

06:48.647 --> 06:51.161
who's got stuck behind two old priests
in a Skoda.

06:52.047 --> 06:53.924
What the hell is that?

06:54.087 --> 06:56.681
Non-space, sir.
An abyss of infinite nothingness

06:56.847 --> 06:59.042
where time doesn't seem to exist.

06:59.247 --> 07:01.556
Sounds like Rimmer's organ recital night.

07:07.927 --> 07:12.364
I recognise those guys. Wait. Don't tell me.

07:12.567 --> 07:14.603
How's it going?

07:16.927 --> 07:19.316
- You're a hologram.
- Hard light.

07:19.527 --> 07:21.802
So in your dimension Lister died?

07:22.007 --> 07:24.123
In the radiation leak
that wiped out Red Dwarf.

07:24.327 --> 07:27.000
Why weren't you put into stasis like me?
What happened?

07:27.207 --> 07:29.641
Remember coming back
from shore leave on Mimas?

07:29.847 --> 07:33.965
I'd taken a couple of days off
to get over Kochanski. Yeah, I remember...

07:35.687 --> 07:39.236
Where the hell have you been?
I've reported you as AWOL.

07:40.007 --> 07:43.443
I've been on shore leave, man.
Didn't you get me message?

07:43.647 --> 07:48.038
You're supposed to apply to a superior officer
before you get shore leave, Lister.

07:48.207 --> 07:49.481
Look, Rimmer, give me a break.

07:49.647 --> 07:52.445
Ever since Kochanski split with me,
I've needed time on me own.

07:52.607 --> 07:54.962
- Kochanski dumped you?
- Yeah.

07:55.127 --> 07:57.880
- She really dumped you?
- Yes!

07:58.047 --> 08:01.642
You didn't tell me! You should've told me.
Are you really heartbroken?

08:01.807 --> 08:04.037
- You know, man, you know...
- You are, aren't you?

08:04.207 --> 08:05.845
OK, yes! Yes!

08:06.047 --> 08:08.959
Didn't I tell you you'd never bridge
that class division?

08:09.127 --> 08:13.120
Take her - navigation officer,
cadet school, Space Corps, well-spoken,

08:13.287 --> 08:17.075
can stay awake during operas,
knows her cheeses.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.636
She's class. And you? What are you?

08:19.807 --> 08:22.241
I don't mean to sound cruel,
but in comparison you're scum.

08:22.407 --> 08:23.806
And second-rate scum, at that.

08:23.967 --> 08:28.404
But don't forget: I used to be fourth-rate scum.
I've dragged meself up by me bootstraps.

08:28.567 --> 08:32.116
Listy, Listy, your type isn't Kochanski, Listy.

08:32.287 --> 08:35.996
It's someone called Tiffany.
Someone who drinks Campari and soda

08:36.167 --> 08:38.476
and wears orange crotchless panties,

08:38.647 --> 08:40.797
someone who thinks deelyboppers are funny,

08:40.967 --> 08:43.640
someone who says "sumfink"
instead of "something"

08:43.807 --> 08:47.038
and laughs like a freshly-wounded moose
strapped to a cement mixer.

08:47.207 --> 08:50.404
This from a man
who's had less sex than a lettuce.

08:50.567 --> 08:51.920
Oh, ha-ha (!)

08:52.087 --> 08:54.317
People who say "ha-ha"
have no sense of humour.

08:54.487 --> 08:57.160
They just can't think of a witty retort.

08:57.327 --> 08:59.363
Oh, ha-ha (!)

09:02.727 --> 09:03.921
Ms Kochanski, ma'am.

09:04.647 --> 09:07.844
I don't suppose you've read my proposal
for a new Space Corps salute?

09:09.807 --> 09:13.117
It's just, I'm trying to get the support
of the officers.

09:13.327 --> 09:16.842
I don't want to pressure you, but it is
rather important because if you like it,

09:17.007 --> 09:22.923
that brings the overall total of officers
who are right behind it up to... one.

09:23.127 --> 09:24.765
- Rimmer?
- Yes, ma'am?

09:24.967 --> 09:28.084
- Have sex with someone. That's an order.
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.

09:28.287 --> 09:32.724
'Ere. Ring this number. Say I sent you.
Tell them it's an emergency.

09:34.847 --> 09:36.565
- Hi
- Hmm...

09:36.727 --> 09:41.676
I just wanted to say, look,
I'm sorry for the Dear John. It was cowardly.

09:41.887 --> 09:46.085
What? Oh, that! Sorry, I'd completely
forgot. It seems like years ago.

09:46.287 --> 09:48.517
- It was last week.
- Was it?

09:48.687 --> 09:51.360
- Mm-hmm.
- Must've got over it just like that.

09:51.527 --> 09:54.599
Oh, come on, Dave.
We weren't going anywhere.

09:54.767 --> 09:56.917
How could we? We never got out of bed.

09:57.087 --> 09:59.237
There's more to life
than hanging out in your bunk,

09:59.407 --> 10:01.477
eating delivery curries
and having fantastic sex.

10:01.687 --> 10:06.044
- Frankly, I find that very hard to believe.
- I wanted to see if we could be friends.

10:06.247 --> 10:09.080
- Do you mean give it another go?
- No, no.

10:09.247 --> 10:11.841
- I'm, er... back with Tim now.
- Tim?!

10:13.407 --> 10:14.965
That guy is such a poser!

10:15.127 --> 10:18.517
The way he always wears that white suit
and that stupid, big floppy hat.

10:18.727 --> 10:20.126
He's a chef.

10:20.927 --> 10:23.077
Yeah, but the way he poses around in it,

10:23.247 --> 10:26.205
in the officers' club,
smoking those black cigarettes.

10:26.367 --> 10:29.404
- He's such a phoney.
- At least he's got a vocation.

10:29.607 --> 10:31.086
And you think because I happen to be

10:31.247 --> 10:34.637
vice-assistant vending machine deputy-minion
maintenance repair man, I'm nobody?

10:34.847 --> 10:36.485
Well... yes.

10:37.247 --> 10:40.637
Do you think a guy who brings on ten
free Crunchie bar samples every week

10:40.807 --> 10:42.035
hasn't got connections?

10:42.247 --> 10:44.807
- I just think...
- (MIAOWING)

10:48.647 --> 10:51.639
Do you know what you'd get
for smuggling a cat on board?

10:51.807 --> 10:55.720
- What? Cat-martialled?
- I could have you before a disciplinary board.

10:55.927 --> 10:58.885
- How long before? Do I get chance to change?
- I'm serious!

10:59.047 --> 11:01.959
As serving N.O., I'm supposed to report it!

11:02.127 --> 11:05.324
So report it.
Get me put into stasis for six months.

11:05.527 --> 11:09.725
Don't you know how dangerous it is
to smuggle in an un-quarantined animal?

11:09.887 --> 11:12.162
I was lonely. I'd just been dumped
by me girlfriend.

11:12.327 --> 11:14.477
It breaks every reg in the manual.

11:25.607 --> 11:27.404
(BEEPING)

11:36.527 --> 11:40.486
Just don't get caught
or I'm out cold for six months, OK?

11:40.647 --> 11:43.878
So you didn't get put into stasis
and died with the rest of the crew?

11:44.087 --> 11:47.762
- Then Holly brought me back as a hologram.
- What happened to Kochanski?

11:47.967 --> 11:51.437
They found the cat,
and she got six months in stasis.

11:51.607 --> 11:53.598
So does that mean...?

12:01.007 --> 12:02.281
Hi.

12:03.607 --> 12:08.556
- You look great!
- You look pretty amazing yourself.

12:08.767 --> 12:13.045
So in this dimension, you didn't die?
You're an alternate version of Dave.

12:14.127 --> 12:20.043
I think of meself as the definitive version,
honed to perfection by time and evolution.

12:24.727 --> 12:26.718
I can see why you'd think that.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.842
Sirs, ma'am, we've scarcely two hours

12:30.007 --> 12:33.602
before the dimensional tear self-repairs
and we lose the linkway.

12:33.767 --> 12:37.919
I suggest we might spend some of that time
exchanging supplies and information.

12:38.087 --> 12:42.478
We could update your hydrogen RAM-drive
to a tachyon-powered engine core.

12:42.687 --> 12:46.646
And in return, maybe we can unscrew
all those old pickle jars you can't open.

12:48.367 --> 12:51.484
- There is something you could do for us.
- Yeah?

12:51.647 --> 12:54.844
At some point, I want to have children.

12:55.047 --> 12:59.484
It's a slightly pervy thing to ask, especially
since we've just met, but perhaps you could...

12:59.687 --> 13:03.316
- Yeah?
- After all, we've been... you know, lovers...

13:03.527 --> 13:05.597
- Perhaps you could...
- Yeah?

13:06.487 --> 13:10.366
- Fill this up.
- I'd rather be standing a bit closer.

13:10.567 --> 13:14.799
It's a self-gamete mixing-in vitro tube.
I'm already in there.

13:15.007 --> 13:17.885
It just needs your... contribution.

13:21.087 --> 13:24.443
So it worked out for you guys, then.

13:24.647 --> 13:29.357
I couldn't be more happy. Well, outside
a major dental surgery with a rusty knife.

13:29.527 --> 13:30.960
Congratulations.

13:33.647 --> 13:36.525
Gelf ship! Somehow they've managed
to infiltrate non-space!

13:44.847 --> 13:47.361
Kris, give me your hand!

13:47.567 --> 13:49.842
Hang on to me feet, man!

13:57.447 --> 13:58.766
It's gonna give!

14:11.767 --> 14:13.519
(GRUNTS)

14:47.527 --> 14:50.439
- She's really something, isn't she?
- Who is?

14:50.607 --> 14:52.245
Officer Bud-Babe.

14:52.447 --> 14:58.158
In fact, I'm barely hanging on to my title
as most gorgeous creature on this ship.

15:00.847 --> 15:03.759
Oh, what am I talking about? Am I crazy?

15:03.967 --> 15:08.563
Cat, man, we're under attack. It might be
an idea to get us the smeg out of here.

15:10.887 --> 15:14.357
What happened? I thought I'd lost you!

15:15.407 --> 15:17.443
- I think you've mistaken me...
- Shh!

15:18.927 --> 15:21.646
- What were you saying?
- Forget it.

15:22.967 --> 15:26.676
Oh, dear! Sir, I think Miss Kochanski's
under the delusion that you're...

15:26.847 --> 15:29.759
- Not now, Kryten.
- But you don't understand.

15:29.927 --> 15:32.157
Miss Kochanski thinks...
- I've handled it, OK?

15:32.327 --> 15:34.318
Now, go make some sweet tea or something.

15:34.487 --> 15:38.480
- Er... Permission to speak, sir?
- Permission refused!

15:42.767 --> 15:47.124
- Wait a minute. This isn't the medi-bay.
- You must have mistaken me for your Lister.

15:47.327 --> 15:51.764
- That's what I've been trying to tell you!
- Were you?

15:52.607 --> 15:56.236
If only you'd listened to me,
I could have saved you from all that yuckiness.

15:56.447 --> 15:57.846
Is that the kind of guy you are?

15:58.007 --> 16:00.726
Someone who'd take advantage of a woman
who's half insensible?

16:00.927 --> 16:03.202
I was gonna tell you, honestly.

16:03.407 --> 16:06.285
They always taught me in school
it was rude to talk with your mouth full.

16:07.247 --> 16:10.478
Wait, you mean I'm stuck here with you?

16:10.647 --> 16:14.481
Priscilla, Queen of Deep Space?
No way. I've gotta get that linkway back!

16:14.647 --> 16:16.080
(CRASH)

16:17.567 --> 16:20.877
It's not exactly possible at the moment.
We're under attack.

16:21.287 --> 16:23.403
- It's back on our tail!
- What is it?

16:23.567 --> 16:26.127
Some Gelf battle cruiser.

16:26.327 --> 16:29.205
They've sent a scan, sir. Take a look.

16:30.527 --> 16:32.802
Oh, my God. It's the missus.

16:33.007 --> 16:35.316
- The what?
- Mr Lister's Gelf bride.

16:35.527 --> 16:38.997
We all went to the wedding.
It was just beautiful.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.641
- He married this?!
- He had to.

16:41.807 --> 16:46.085
- You mean...?
- We were in a fix! We needed an engine part.

16:46.287 --> 16:51.407
You should visit the orang-utan house at
London Zoo. Your eyes would be out on stalks!

16:52.207 --> 16:57.201
They're opening comms channels. Sir,
they're demanding you return to your bride.

16:57.367 --> 16:59.517
In Gelf law, separation is impossible

16:59.687 --> 17:03.919
without special dispensation
from Hakakhhak-kkhhak...

17:04.807 --> 17:07.924
hhakh-hhakhkhkahak-hkaahkahk-hkhk,

17:08.087 --> 17:12.126
Chief Justice of hakhakhk-aahkahkh

17:12.287 --> 17:18.396
hkhakkhaakhaaakah-akkk-hhakaaaak
kak-akk-hakkakak ka ka ka.

17:20.367 --> 17:23.757
OK, patch me into the MCN,
and I'll lay down an SS line.

17:23.967 --> 17:28.040
- You'll what, Officer BB?
- Quadrant 4-9-2 stroke G-8-7,

17:28.207 --> 17:31.438
moving across
to Quadrant 2 to Q-4-1 stroke 9.

17:31.607 --> 17:33.882
- Just follow my coords.
- Your cords?

17:34.087 --> 17:36.555
- Yeah, my coords.
- Follow your cords?

17:36.767 --> 17:40.203
- Is that a problem?
- You're not talking about trousers, are you?

17:41.167 --> 17:42.600
Coordinates.

17:42.807 --> 17:45.605
Coordinates! Thank you!

17:57.047 --> 17:59.959
20 degrees starboard on this next 'berg.

18:03.167 --> 18:05.397
<i>They're right on our tails.</i>

18:05.607 --> 18:08.679
Hold this line. Keep holding...

18:08.847 --> 18:10.280
Keep holding...

18:11.487 --> 18:13.443
Lift now!

18:23.007 --> 18:24.804
Pretty snazzy!

18:30.167 --> 18:35.400
Still no sign of Miss Kochanski's ship, sir.
We're fast running out of time.

18:35.567 --> 18:39.719
- I know. It's good, isn't it?
- No, sir. I don't believe it is.

18:39.887 --> 18:43.084
- Don't you like her?
- I'm a mere mechanoid, sir.

18:43.247 --> 18:47.001
Hardly my place to point out
what a... bossy old trollop she is.

18:47.167 --> 18:51.399
- Good kisser, though.
- She knew that was you all along, sir!

18:51.567 --> 18:56.163
She was merely trying you out
to compare you with her Mr Lister.

18:56.327 --> 18:59.558
Apparently, he's quite something.
Initially, a soft-light hologram,

18:59.727 --> 19:04.084
that's made him sensitive and caring
in a way most men aren't.

19:04.247 --> 19:07.922
You mean he can remember anniversaries
and stay awake for several seconds after sex?

19:08.087 --> 19:11.966
He's every woman's dream guy, sir.
He even enjoys shopping for shoes!

19:12.127 --> 19:14.004
- Jesus...
- A human male

19:14.167 --> 19:17.762
who's prepared to have in-depth discussions
about "relationships".

19:17.927 --> 19:18.916
Eurgh!

19:19.087 --> 19:21.885
We're talking about
someone quite exceptional, sir.

19:22.047 --> 19:26.040
- Where does that leave me?
- Well, that leaves you...

19:26.207 --> 19:30.086
trying to help me
get her back to her rightful ship.

19:31.687 --> 19:34.326
She can't stay here, sir.

19:35.487 --> 19:37.284
She just can't!

19:38.687 --> 19:41.121
Kryten, man, are you OK?

19:41.287 --> 19:44.165
(WHINES) I just know
we're not gonna be able to get rid of her!

19:44.327 --> 19:45.965
Is that so terrible?

19:46.127 --> 19:49.642
She's gonna take you away from me!
I just know it!

19:49.807 --> 19:51.035
What?!

19:51.207 --> 19:54.199
I took her a glass of milk
when she was showering.

19:54.367 --> 19:57.564
I've seen her naked!

19:57.727 --> 19:59.206
So?

19:59.367 --> 20:03.076
She's got all those in-and-out bits
that you like.

20:03.247 --> 20:07.718
Kryten, no matter what happens,
you and me, we're compadres, amigos.

20:07.887 --> 20:12.199
But that's all gonna change if she stays!
You'll end up liking her more!

20:12.367 --> 20:14.005
- I won't! I won't!
- You will! You will!

20:14.167 --> 20:16.635
I won't! I won't! I won't!

20:16.807 --> 20:19.605
- You promise?
- I promise.

20:19.767 --> 20:22.804
So if she walked in here now
and took all her clothes off

20:22.967 --> 20:27.085
and said, "Oh!
Make love to me, you horny dude,"

20:27.247 --> 20:31.843
and I said, "Perhaps you'd prefer
to fold some sheets with me instead, sir?"

20:32.007 --> 20:34.043
What would you do?

20:34.207 --> 20:36.357
What kind of sheets would they be?

20:36.527 --> 20:38.961
Those nice cotton ones with the pattern.

20:39.127 --> 20:43.518
- The blue stripy ones or green square ones?
- The green square ones.

20:43.687 --> 20:46.918
So it's making love to Kochanski

20:47.087 --> 20:49.521
or folding sheets with you?

20:50.647 --> 20:52.956
- Can I do final fold-and-stack?
- Absolutely.

20:53.127 --> 20:56.403
- It'd be sheets, then.
- She's standing there all naked

20:56.567 --> 21:00.003
with all the in-and-out bits
going all inny and outy?

21:00.167 --> 21:03.876
It'd be the sheets, Kryt.
You and me. Hospital corners.

21:04.047 --> 21:06.515
- Really?
- Too true.

21:08.207 --> 21:12.997
(SQUEALS) You're lying!
You're just trying to make me feel better!

21:13.167 --> 21:17.365
Oh! Why can't she be more
like Mr Rimmer? He was perfect!

21:17.527 --> 21:20.837
He didn't have any in-and-out bits
hardly at all.

21:21.007 --> 21:24.477
There's no one I care more about
than you, OK?

21:24.647 --> 21:27.366
I'd never dump you like she did! Never!

21:27.527 --> 21:29.563
- That's not gonna change.
- Never?

21:29.727 --> 21:31.080
Never.

21:32.727 --> 21:35.241
- (SQUEALS) You're lying!
- I'm not lying!

21:35.447 --> 21:40.567
Yes, you are! I'm gonna end up on my own
just like I did on the Nova 5!

21:40.727 --> 21:43.082
You killed the crew, Kryten!

21:43.247 --> 21:47.286
No wonder you ended up on your own!
It was an accident, but nevertheless...

21:47.447 --> 21:50.041
But what about before that?
It was the same on the SS Augustus.

21:50.207 --> 21:52.357
They all died of old age!

21:52.527 --> 21:54.404
You see?!

22:00.207 --> 22:01.799
(BLEEPING)

22:03.767 --> 22:07.806
I thought I'd lend a hand and see
if I could help you get out of here.

22:07.967 --> 22:12.404
I've got a positive trans-dimensional trace,
but I still can't re-establish the linkway.

22:12.567 --> 22:15.479
I'm sure it's something to do
with electro-magnetic phasing frequencies.

22:15.647 --> 22:20.163
- You took the words right out of my mouth.
- Have you tried reversing the signal?

22:20.327 --> 22:22.921
We'll need a power re-route
in the auxiliary power drives.

22:23.127 --> 22:26.483
I'll take care of that... whatever it is.

22:29.687 --> 22:32.042
It's the big red button there, sir.

22:39.687 --> 22:44.556
Hey, Officer Bud-Babe,
that power simillililillum-linilillum drive?

22:44.727 --> 22:46.524
Taken care of.

22:52.727 --> 22:54.638
You don't like me, do you?

22:54.847 --> 22:56.883
- Ma'am?
- You don't, do you?

22:57.087 --> 23:00.716
Ma'am, I think it would be more efficient
if we spent our energies

23:00.887 --> 23:03.162
trying to re-establish the linkway.

23:03.367 --> 23:05.835
- But why...?
- Please.

23:06.007 --> 23:07.326
- I mean...
- Ma'am!

23:08.167 --> 23:10.806
- I need to know why!
- Do you indeed?

23:11.007 --> 23:15.080
- Yes.
- You're not good enough for him! That's all.

23:15.287 --> 23:19.166
OK, he may walk around
smelling like a Balti house laundry basket,

23:19.327 --> 23:22.842
but he doesn't need the likes of you
swapping dimensions like there's no tomorrow

23:23.007 --> 23:27.762
and bewitching him with all your...
in-and-out bits, all pointy and unnecessary.

23:29.767 --> 23:31.678
You've got big problems, you know that?

23:32.407 --> 23:36.400
Well, at least I don't have a ridiculous walk,
unlike some people.

23:36.607 --> 23:39.724
Huh! Have you seen the way YOU walk?

23:39.927 --> 23:42.566
I have a perfectly sensible walk.

23:43.207 --> 23:45.880
At least I don't walk like this:

23:48.567 --> 23:50.922
(BLEEPING)

23:51.087 --> 23:53.647
Phaser frequency 4-3-4. We've got it back!

23:53.807 --> 23:55.798
What? You're right! That's it!

23:55.967 --> 23:58.800
- I can leave!
- You can leave!

24:05.807 --> 24:09.197
Here's the 2,000 bulbs of garlic
your Lister wanted.

24:11.407 --> 24:13.318
Phew-wee!

24:13.487 --> 24:15.955
I may just have my nose hermetically sealed.

24:16.167 --> 24:20.718
Is this right? 18 crates of curry
and no pasta at all?

24:20.887 --> 24:22.684
(MOUTHS)

24:23.007 --> 24:27.523
Champagne, everyone! If this doesn't deserve
a celebration, I don't know what does!

24:27.727 --> 24:31.117
- What are we celebrating exactly?
- (MOUTHS SILENTLY)

24:32.047 --> 24:34.242
You've found your crewmates at last!
How wonderful!

24:34.407 --> 24:37.160
- Thanks, Kryten.
- I must go and find the others.

24:45.287 --> 24:46.800
This is for you.

24:48.007 --> 24:49.679
It wasn't easy.

24:49.847 --> 24:52.441
I'm not exactly awash with helpful material here.

24:52.607 --> 24:55.565
I had to use one of Rimmer's
old James Last albums -

24:55.727 --> 24:59.003
a girl in a yellow crocheted miniskirt
doing the twist.

24:59.167 --> 25:02.364
It was like peeling an orange
with a chopstick.

25:02.527 --> 25:05.678
- I didn't need to know that.
- Anyway, it's all worked.

25:05.847 --> 25:11.080
Just pop that in the uterine simulator
in your medi-lab and... bingo.

25:11.247 --> 25:13.238
- Wow!
- Our child.

25:14.327 --> 25:16.761
I'll... you know.

25:16.927 --> 25:19.680
- I know.
- Any advice?

25:19.847 --> 25:24.318
- For the baby, I mean.
- What, advice about life and stuff?

25:24.487 --> 25:27.763
Well, tell it you can always park
nearer than you think.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.760
Don't go to Sweden. Avoid sprouts.

25:30.927 --> 25:31.996
Oh, and if you're a guy,

25:32.167 --> 25:35.796
never chop up hot chillies then go for
a leak without washing your hands first.

25:35.967 --> 25:39.801
It feels like a bomb's just gone off
in your pants.

25:39.967 --> 25:41.400
That's it.

25:41.567 --> 25:45.560
A lifetime's worth of wisdom
crammed into under a minute.

25:46.207 --> 25:49.438
As soon as it's old enough,
I'll tell it all about you.

25:49.607 --> 25:52.838
Apart from how you eat spaghetti.

25:53.007 --> 25:57.398
Just make it understand why I'm not there.
I don't want it ending up like me.

25:57.567 --> 26:01.685
What happened to you was really rough.
The pool table, no note, no explanation...

26:03.607 --> 26:07.077
I think that's why I spent most of
my early life drifting, you know?

26:07.247 --> 26:11.763
I didn't have anything to live up to 'cause
I didn't know who I was, where I came from,

26:11.927 --> 26:15.920
just those two names they couldn't decide
on calling me - Rob or Ross.

26:16.087 --> 26:19.841
Hey... I'll look after it. You know I will.

26:20.007 --> 26:22.077
Yeah, I know.

26:25.847 --> 26:29.920
Excuse me, sir.
Just doing a spot of dusting here.

26:38.687 --> 26:41.759
Look, this is probably a long shot,
but if we can hit the right settings,

26:41.927 --> 26:44.202
it may be possible to communicate
trans-dimensionally.

26:46.527 --> 26:48.199
See you.

26:48.367 --> 26:50.198
Bye.

26:55.527 --> 26:57.961
- What's this?
- Supplies from Bud-Babe's ship.

26:58.127 --> 27:00.402
- No, this.
- It's the symbol for infinity.

27:00.567 --> 27:04.446
The snake eating its own tail, and thus
completing the everlasting circle of life

27:04.607 --> 27:05.960
that has no beginning or end.

27:06.127 --> 27:10.120
- What's it doing on here?
- The crate used to contain Ouroboros batteries.

27:10.287 --> 27:13.040
- Everlasting.
- Ourobo-what?!

27:13.207 --> 27:15.516
Ouroboros, sir, it's the name of the symbol.

27:19.807 --> 27:22.605
- What is it, bud?
- Ouroboros...

27:22.767 --> 27:25.884
It wasn't "Our Rob or Ross", it was Ouroboros.

27:26.087 --> 27:27.315
What was?

27:27.527 --> 27:28.846
The message that was written
on the side of me box!

27:29.047 --> 27:31.356
You came in a box? That explains everything.

27:33.407 --> 27:37.366
I know who my parents are.
I know who I am. I understand now.

27:37.567 --> 27:40.798
Explain, sir. The in-vitro tube,
the one Kochanski's got.

27:40.967 --> 27:43.197
The frozen embryo - it's me!

27:44.007 --> 27:46.601
At some point if the baby's born,
we must go back in time

27:46.767 --> 27:49.281
and leave him under the pool table
at the Aigburth Arms.

27:49.487 --> 27:52.001
We wrote Ouroboros on the box to explain!

27:52.207 --> 27:57.406
I'm my own father...
and Kris is my ex-girlfriend and me mum!

27:58.407 --> 28:02.195
You should write a letter to "Playboy".
I bet you anything it'd get printed.

28:02.407 --> 28:04.841
I've gotta get that test tube back.

28:11.327 --> 28:13.124
Wait!

28:13.767 --> 28:17.282
- What?
- I need the in-vitro tube! It's me!

28:17.487 --> 28:19.364
It's what?

28:21.767 --> 28:23.246
The Gelfs are back!

28:38.167 --> 28:40.886
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna jump!

28:41.087 --> 28:42.998
- You'll never make it!
- Kris, no!

28:47.007 --> 28:49.840
- Kristine!
- We've lost her, sir.

28:50.047 --> 28:51.605
No. No!

28:51.807 --> 28:53.957
Kristine!

28:54.167 --> 28:56.237
(PHONE RINGS)

28:56.647 --> 28:58.558
- Yeah?
- <i>Hi, it's me.</i>

28:58.767 --> 29:02.601
- Hi.
- <i>I've decided to stay. Just one proviso...</i>

29:02.807 --> 29:05.275
- Yeah?
- <i>Save my life, OK?</i>

29:05.967 --> 29:07.320
Cargo bay. Looking now.

29:13.087 --> 29:14.645
What's this?

29:14.807 --> 29:16.957
Mountaineering equipment
from Miss Kochanski's ship, sir.

29:17.127 --> 29:18.162
A crossbow?

29:18.327 --> 29:21.080
I thought it might come in handy
next time you run into your wife.

29:22.647 --> 29:27.163
<i>(KOCHANSKI) You've got about 20 seconds</i>
<i>before I'm out of reachI</i>

29:27.327 --> 29:29.045
Rope?

29:29.207 --> 29:32.404
Yes! Yes! Yes!

29:36.727 --> 29:38.957
<i>I'm getting a mite panicky hereI</i>

29:58.087 --> 29:59.679
Argh!

30:04.087 --> 30:05.805
Bastard!

30:09.807 --> 30:11.843
(PHONE RINGS)

30:16.607 --> 30:20.600
It's an obscene phone call, sir.
I think it's for you.

30:25.647 --> 30:30.323
I've brought you a drink, but don't think
it means I've gone all mushy on you.

30:32.407 --> 30:35.843
I'm gonna get up and work out a way
of re-establishing that linkway.

30:36.007 --> 30:38.885
It's too late, ma'am. The rip's self-repaired.

30:39.047 --> 30:43.643
- (WHINES) We're stuck with you!
- I'm gonna try anyway.

30:49.047 --> 30:50.526
Oh, ma'am?

30:50.687 --> 30:52.245
Yes, Kryten?

30:53.367 --> 30:55.642
Welcome aboard.

30:55.807 --> 30:57.798
Thanks, Kryten.

31:08.047 --> 31:13.246
For a long time, you'll think that you were
abandoned, but you weren't, man.

31:13.407 --> 31:17.958
You were put here to create a paradox,
an unbreakable circle.

31:18.127 --> 31:22.962
With us going round and round in time,
the human race can never become extinct.

31:23.127 --> 31:25.846
We're like... a kind of holding pattern.

31:30.767 --> 31:32.200
I'll see you, son.

31:49.807 --> 31:53.163
<i># It's cold outside,</i>
<i>there's no kind of atmosphere</i>

31:53.327 --> 31:56.603
<i># I'm all alone, more or less</i>

31:56.767 --> 31:59.884
<i># Let me fly far away from here</i>

32:00.047 --> 32:02.800
<i># Fun, fun, fun</i>

32:02.967 --> 32:06.482
<i># In the sun, sun, sun</i>

32:06.647 --> 32:09.957
<i># I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose</i>

32:10.127 --> 32:13.278
<i># Drinking fresh mango juice</i>

32:13.447 --> 32:16.678
<i># Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes</i>

32:16.847 --> 32:19.441
<i># Fun, fun, fun</i>

32:19.607 --> 32:23.202
<i># In the sun, sun, sun</i>

32:23.367 --> 32:26.086
<i># Fun, fun, fun</i>

32:26.247 --> 32:30.399
<i># In the sun, sun, sun #</i>
