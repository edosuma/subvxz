00:03.886 --> 00:06.013
This wasn't part of our agreement.

00:06.220 --> 00:10.682
You failed in your last mission.
The Klingon Empire is intact.

00:10.890 --> 00:13.435
You knew there would be
consequences.

00:13.685 --> 00:16.353
Please, I won't disappoint you again.

00:16.562 --> 00:21.274
We'll restore it, but only if you succeed
in your next mission.

00:21.524 --> 00:23.942
But you're disabling me.

00:24.151 --> 00:27.320
You won't need enhanced vision
where you're going.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.573
Proceed with the extraction.

"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

00:49.962 --> 00:53.381
"It's been a long time"

00:53.589 --> 00:57.427
"But my time is finally near"

00:57.634 --> 01:01.887
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

01:02.096 --> 01:05.015
"I will touch the sky"

01:05.224 --> 01:09.018
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

01:09.227 --> 01:12.229
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

01:12.438 --> 01:17.150
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

01:17.358 --> 01:20.277
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

01:20.485 --> 01:25.072
"I've got faith to believe"

01:25.281 --> 01:27.865
"I can do anything"

01:28.074 --> 01:32.577
"I've got strength of the soul"

01:32.786 --> 01:35.664
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

01:35.872 --> 01:41.209
"I can reach any star"

01:41.584 --> 01:45.337
"I've got faith"

01:45.546 --> 01:49.257
"I've got faith"

01:49.465 --> 01:54.261
"Faith of the heart"

02:13.215 --> 02:15.008
Hold the door.

02:16.050 --> 02:18.386
Hey, where were you last night?

02:18.595 --> 02:20.470
I decided to turn in early.

02:20.679 --> 02:22.139
Well, you didn't miss much.

02:22.347 --> 02:25.475
- What'd they show?
- Night of the Killer Androids.

02:25.726 --> 02:26.727
That bad?

02:26.935 --> 02:29.061
We've got 50,000 movies
in the database.

02:29.270 --> 02:31.731
There must be something
worth watching.

02:31.938 --> 02:33.606
You could always read a book.

02:36.692 --> 02:39.361
- Lieutenant.
- Ensigns.

02:39.903 --> 02:41.571
Enjoy the show last night?

02:46.575 --> 02:49.870
Those were two hours of my life
I'd rather have back.

02:55.124 --> 02:56.834
Good morning, sir.

02:57.625 --> 02:59.544
Morning, Daniels.

03:00.169 --> 03:03.380
- I thought this was Taylor's shift.
- I switched with him, if that's all right.

03:03.588 --> 03:04.589
No problem.

03:04.798 --> 03:07.633
Sir, I noticed we changed course.
May I ask why?

03:07.842 --> 03:10.302
There's a stellar nursery
not far from here.

03:10.510 --> 03:13.264
We detected several ships inside.

03:13.472 --> 03:15.390
We thought we might go say hello.

03:15.765 --> 03:19.268
- Very good, sir. More orange juice?
- No, thanks, I'm fine.

03:32.111 --> 03:33.362
What have you got?

03:33.571 --> 03:36.031
We've found one of the ships, sir.

03:36.531 --> 03:38.117
Put it up.

03:41.244 --> 03:43.538
It appears to be a transport vessel.

03:44.622 --> 03:46.206
Hail them.

03:47.582 --> 03:48.750
They're responding.

03:50.209 --> 03:51.252
Can I help you?

03:51.794 --> 03:55.922
My name is Archer.
I'm captain of the starship Enterprise.

03:56.131 --> 03:58.382
We're from Earth.

03:58.590 --> 04:00.467
We thought we'd introduce
ourselves.

04:00.677 --> 04:02.135
Pleased to meet you.
What do you want?

04:04.805 --> 04:06.430
Nothing.

04:06.806 --> 04:08.558
We're new to this region

04:08.766 --> 04:11.810
and we're eager to make contact
with other species.

04:12.018 --> 04:13.144
So...

04:13.645 --> 04:16.397
If you don't mind my asking...

04:17.147 --> 04:18.732
...what brings you here?

04:19.232 --> 04:21.067
A job.

04:21.274 --> 04:24.654
I'm escorting a group
of spiritually minded men

04:24.862 --> 04:27.739
on a pilgrimage
to the Great Plume of Agosoria.

04:27.989 --> 04:29.241
The what?

04:29.491 --> 04:33.953
Every 11 years, one of the protostars
gives out a neutron blast.

04:34.161 --> 04:39.040
These gentlemen believe
it's a sacred event.

04:39.374 --> 04:41.500
If you ask me,
it's just another ball of hydrogen.

04:42.084 --> 04:44.794
When is this Great Plume
due to erupt?

04:45.461 --> 04:46.879
Tomorrow.

04:47.463 --> 04:50.758
- Mind if we join you?
- It's your time to waste.

04:52.593 --> 04:58.555
I'd like to extend an invitation to you
and your passengers to visit Enterprise.

04:58.764 --> 05:00.599
I'll ask them if they're interested.

05:00.808 --> 05:02.517
I prefer to stay with my ship.

05:03.518 --> 05:05.061
Understood.

05:05.269 --> 05:09.689
- Mr...?
- Fraddock. Captain Fraddock.

05:14.528 --> 05:17.071
Looks like we could be having guests.

05:18.697 --> 05:21.699
Tell chef to prepare...

05:21.908 --> 05:23.450
...something.

05:32.123 --> 05:34.084
Seal's good.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.172
Welcome aboard.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.173
Captain Jonathan Archer.

05:43.133 --> 05:48.262
It's customary on Earth
to greet someone with a handshake.

05:49.763 --> 05:51.598
I'm Prah Mantoos.

05:51.807 --> 05:54.683
May Agosoria embrace you
into his cycle of renewal.

05:55.726 --> 05:56.769
Thanks.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.312
These are my fellow celebrants.

05:59.521 --> 06:04.984
We've travelled many light years from
different worlds to watch this event.

06:05.193 --> 06:07.069
I'm Commander Tucker,
chief engineer,

06:07.277 --> 06:11.030
and this is our science officer,
Sub-commander T'Pol.

06:12.490 --> 06:14.866
For you, captain.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.826
It's beautiful.

06:17.035 --> 06:20.412
- What exactly is it?
- A clock.

06:20.788 --> 06:23.832
It charts time
from the beginning of the universe.

06:26.335 --> 06:30.296
It's a spirit traditionally consumed
as the Plume reaches its full brilliance.

06:30.546 --> 06:32.547
You'll find it enhances the experience.

06:33.465 --> 06:35.050
I'm sure it does.

06:35.926 --> 06:37.760
You're very generous.

06:37.968 --> 06:40.720
I'm afraid the only thing we have
to offer you is our hospitality.

06:41.095 --> 06:43.765
That will be more than enough.

06:44.015 --> 06:46.141
Our chef has prepared
a meal in your honour.

06:47.142 --> 06:49.978
Normally, we fast
during the Time of Agosoria.

06:50.187 --> 06:55.024
But in this case,
I suppose we can break with tradition.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.151
Please.

07:08.493 --> 07:12.455
- Four months, three weeks, and...?
- Six days.

07:12.663 --> 07:15.582
You've travelled a great distance
in a short period of time.

07:15.790 --> 07:18.585
Warp 5 will get you
where you're going pretty fast.

07:18.793 --> 07:20.961
We've seen a lot since we left Earth,

07:21.211 --> 07:26.049
but I have to say that this place
is definitely one of the highlights.

07:26.257 --> 07:29.051
I'm pleased you appreciate
its beauty, captain.

07:29.259 --> 07:32.720
To us, it's more than just a simple
stellar nursery.

07:32.928 --> 07:37.558
According to our sacred texts,
this is where the universe began.

07:37.767 --> 07:41.311
- And the Great Plume of Aga...?
- Agosoria.

07:41.519 --> 07:43.313
Agosoria. How does that fit in?

07:43.563 --> 07:46.315
It represents
the continuing cycle of creation.

07:46.565 --> 07:49.109
It's not unlike the Hindu faith,
commander.

07:49.317 --> 07:53.321
They also believe that the universe
goes through repeated cycles of rebirth.

07:53.528 --> 07:56.448
I didn't realize you were familiar
with Earth religions, doctor.

07:56.656 --> 07:57.657
Oh, yes.

07:57.907 --> 08:00.702
In fact, while I was there, I made
a point to study a number of them.

08:00.910 --> 08:02.536
I spent two weeks
at a Tibetan monastery,

08:02.745 --> 08:06.123
where I learned to sing chords
with the high lamas.

08:06.332 --> 08:09.375
I attended Mass
at Saint Peter's Square.

08:09.584 --> 08:13.754
I was even allowed to observe the
Tal-Shanar at the Vulcan consulate.

08:14.004 --> 08:16.630
I understand Vulcans
are a deeply spiritual people.

08:16.881 --> 08:20.550
Our beliefs are based on logic
and the pursuit of clarity.

08:21.509 --> 08:23.511
Do you follow a particular faith,
captain?

08:24.637 --> 08:28.056
I guess you could say
I try to keep an open mind.

08:28.265 --> 08:31.852
Many who see the Great Plume
are often inspired by it.

08:32.059 --> 08:34.770
Perhaps you will be too.

08:38.857 --> 08:42.484
- Did you get to meet them?
- Two, briefly.

08:43.027 --> 08:46.154
- What were they like?
- Quiet.

08:46.362 --> 08:48.240
They're taking a tour of the ship.

08:48.449 --> 08:50.408
Looks like the captain's going all out.

08:50.658 --> 08:52.660
I hope he's not planning
to show them the armoury.

08:52.869 --> 08:53.952
Don't worry, lieutenant.

08:54.202 --> 08:57.955
They didn't look like the types who'd
go around stealing military secrets.

08:58.164 --> 09:00.916
Still, we're not familiar
with these species.

09:01.125 --> 09:04.085
Tactical systems should be off-limits.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.421
Starboard targeting sensor's out again.

09:07.629 --> 09:10.383
- Should I call Engineering?
- No, I'll take care of it.

09:10.966 --> 09:13.176
It'll only take a moment.

09:14.678 --> 09:16.846
You have the bridge, ensign.

09:24.601 --> 09:26.103
Aren't you gonna take the chair?

09:27.021 --> 09:28.730
What?

09:29.439 --> 09:31.691
You're in command.

09:36.154 --> 09:37.696
I'm fine right here.

09:38.363 --> 09:40.490
Haven't you ever wondered
what it's like?

09:40.990 --> 09:42.783
I can wait till I'm promoted.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.910
Okay.

09:57.753 --> 09:58.796
Nice fit.

09:59.213 --> 10:02.841
Bridge looks a lot different from here.

10:07.469 --> 10:10.597
Think anyone would mind
if I fired a torpedo?

10:16.935 --> 10:18.895
Permission to take my station.

10:19.562 --> 10:22.023
Sorry, sir.

10:29.737 --> 10:33.031
The gravimetric field
displacement manifold,

10:33.240 --> 10:36.159
commonly known
as the warp reactor.

10:36.368 --> 10:39.036
Just think of it as a great big engine

10:39.245 --> 10:42.622
but instead of using electricity
or chemical fuel,

10:42.831 --> 10:45.834
it runs on antimatter.

10:47.293 --> 10:49.212
See this swirling light?

10:49.420 --> 10:54.674
When matter and antimatter collide,
it creates a whole lot of energy.

10:54.924 --> 10:58.134
And we channel that energy
through those conduits over there,

10:58.343 --> 11:00.595
they lead to the two
large glowing cylinders

11:00.804 --> 11:02.721
you may have seen
on the outside of the ship.

11:02.972 --> 11:04.557
- The nacelles.
- That's right.

11:04.765 --> 11:08.393
Which contain warp coils that create
the subspace displacement field.

11:10.104 --> 11:14.065
I see you already know a thing or two
about starship engines.

11:14.315 --> 11:15.857
I'm a warp field theorist.

11:18.819 --> 11:23.072
Well, I guess that covers the basics.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.614
Any questions?

11:24.823 --> 11:28.367
How do you regulate positron flow
in your dilithium matrix?

11:29.118 --> 11:30.119
Good one.

11:30.786 --> 11:33.914
I'll bring up the schematic
of the reactor assembly,

11:34.122 --> 11:36.500
and you can see for yourself.

11:36.958 --> 11:39.877
If you'll just come with me.

11:41.586 --> 11:43.505
We use a series
of magnetic constrictors

11:43.755 --> 11:45.714
to align the positron stream.

11:45.923 --> 11:50.468
If any stray particles escape,
backups automatically kick in.

11:50.718 --> 11:52.762
During one of our training tests,

11:52.971 --> 11:55.722
we momentarily lost the primaries
and the backups.

11:55.931 --> 11:59.434
About a billion positrons
cut through the plating on three decks.

11:59.643 --> 12:02.145
Nearly caused a hull breach.

12:02.353 --> 12:05.523
We spent a month
redesigning the system.

12:05.731 --> 12:08.817
It hasn't given us a single
problem since.

12:16.864 --> 12:19.658
We're being hailed
by Captain Fraddock.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.745
He's probably calling
about the weather.

12:22.954 --> 12:24.663
On screen.

12:24.871 --> 12:28.123
You might want to focus your sensors
on that plasma lightning up ahead.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.125
We're aware of it.

12:30.334 --> 12:33.294
- You ever been in a plasma storm?
- Twice.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.713
Then you know
it can get a little bumpy.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.589
I suggest we try and go around it.

12:37.839 --> 12:39.132
Agreed.

12:39.341 --> 12:42.134
- Ensign.
- I'm already on it.

12:45.387 --> 12:51.351
There's your heart, lungs, liver,
another heart. Every organ.

12:51.559 --> 12:56.605
This imaging device also allows us
to examine your genetic structure.

12:57.356 --> 12:59.315
You'll be happy to know
you're in perfect health.

12:59.523 --> 13:01.651
Who would like to go next?

13:03.234 --> 13:05.111
Excuse me.

13:07.905 --> 13:10.367
Archer to the bridge. Report.

13:10.949 --> 13:13.660
We're circumnavigating
a plasma storm, captain.

13:13.911 --> 13:15.912
It's just turbulence
from the outer edge.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.497
They're very common in this region.

13:17.705 --> 13:20.373
I'm sure there's nothing
to worry about.

13:25.711 --> 13:27.963
That one hit our port bow.

13:28.379 --> 13:31.007
Power's down on C Deck,
subsection four.

13:31.883 --> 13:33.551
- No other damage.
- Ensign?

13:33.760 --> 13:37.763
The storm's moving in our direction.
I'm having trouble getting around it.

13:38.263 --> 13:40.349
What about the transport ship?

13:40.807 --> 13:42.975
He's far enough ahead.

13:43.184 --> 13:45.393
He made it past.

13:46.519 --> 13:49.356
We've got a power surge
in the impulse relays.

13:49.563 --> 13:51.899
Here's a good example of how
we can reroute the energy flow

13:52.107 --> 13:53.858
to protect our critical systems.

13:55.443 --> 13:59.238
I'm afraid we have to cut the tour
a little short. I'll be on the bridge.

14:19.212 --> 14:22.382
- Report.
- We're losing main power.

14:22.633 --> 14:24.383
Trip, what's happening?

14:25.134 --> 14:26.844
That last bolt struck
the warp manifold.

14:27.511 --> 14:29.179
We've got an
antimatter cascade, sir.

14:29.429 --> 14:31.723
If it reaches the warp reactor,
we're gonna...

14:44.984 --> 14:48.612
I think we're all right, captain.
The cascade stopped in its tracks.

14:50.404 --> 14:51.697
Good work, Trip.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.408
It wasn't me, sir.

15:01.955 --> 15:03.581
Sorry about the bad weather.

15:03.789 --> 15:08.753
We're used to it. I'm just grateful
there was no serious damage.

15:08.961 --> 15:13.006
If any of your group would like to watch
the Great Plume from our mess hall,

15:13.214 --> 15:15.424
they're welcome to come back
tomorrow.

15:15.632 --> 15:17.050
I'll let them know.

15:17.259 --> 15:19.527
- Have a great time, doctor.
- I plan to, captain.

15:19.635 --> 15:22.013
Thank you for letting me spend
the night with these people.

15:22.221 --> 15:25.682
- I'll expect a full report in the morning.
- Aye, captain.

15:26.057 --> 15:28.309
Hope to see you tomorrow.

15:30.436 --> 15:33.522
- Tucker to Captain Archer.
- Go ahead, Trip.

15:33.731 --> 15:36.233
Can you come down
to Engineering for a minute?

15:36.442 --> 15:38.234
On my way.

15:41.737 --> 15:43.697
What is it, Trip?

15:45.073 --> 15:46.866
Take a look at this.

15:47.199 --> 15:48.743
What?

15:50.452 --> 15:53.663
Right up there.

15:54.163 --> 15:57.459
- See that conduit?
- Yeah.

15:57.667 --> 15:59.460
It's an antimatter junction.

15:59.668 --> 16:02.379
It stopped the cascade
from reaching the warp reactor.

16:03.754 --> 16:04.964
What are you getting at?

16:05.548 --> 16:07.132
Somebody got in here
and disconnected it

16:07.340 --> 16:08.925
from the primary antimatter feed.

16:09.134 --> 16:13.387
If they hadn't, that cascade would have
continued right into the reactor core,

16:13.596 --> 16:17.807
and this ship would have gone up
just like the Great Plume of Agosoria.

16:21.728 --> 16:24.479
- One of your staff?
- I already asked.

16:24.688 --> 16:27.315
Nobody seems to know
anything about it.

16:28.315 --> 16:30.151
Sounds to me like you've got a hero

16:30.359 --> 16:32.777
who's a little reluctant
about taking credit.

16:33.236 --> 16:34.863
Talk to them again.

16:35.071 --> 16:37.114
Whoever did this
deserves a commendation.

16:37.322 --> 16:39.867
I'm telling you, sir,
I don't think it was one of my people.

16:40.117 --> 16:41.701
They would have said something.

16:43.954 --> 16:45.163
I spoke with every one of them.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.790
- How about the warp theorist?
- Him too.

16:47.999 --> 16:50.500
None of them went anywhere near
that conduit.

16:51.668 --> 16:56.547
If I told you I did it,
would there be some kind of reward?

16:58.715 --> 17:00.008
Thank you, captain.

17:00.925 --> 17:03.552
Well, maybe it was
the cycle of renewal.

17:04.970 --> 17:08.140
If anyone comes forward,
you'll let me know?

17:08.390 --> 17:10.809
Oh, you'll be the first.

17:21.023 --> 17:23.859
Sir, I need to speak with you.

17:24.068 --> 17:26.904
Why don't you talk to one of my
bridge officers. I'm a little busy now.

17:27.113 --> 17:29.239
- It's important.
- I'm sorry, I've got my hands full.

17:29.447 --> 17:31.325
It's about the Suliban.

17:31.701 --> 17:32.993
What about them?

17:33.201 --> 17:35.453
I believe that one of the pilgrims
who came aboard today

17:35.662 --> 17:37.079
is a Suliban soldier.

17:37.997 --> 17:39.540
His name is Silik.

17:39.790 --> 17:42.750
He's the man you fought with
on the Helix.

17:45.294 --> 17:48.296
How the hell do you know
what I did on the Helix?

17:50.005 --> 17:53.134
It might be best
if we discuss this in private.

17:53.884 --> 17:56.345
- My ready room.
- Better if we went to my quarters.

17:56.554 --> 17:57.596
What?

17:57.847 --> 17:59.931
You'll understand
when we get there, sir.

18:08.646 --> 18:12.565
Oh, please, have a seat.
I'm sorry about the mess.

18:12.774 --> 18:17.403
Sometimes I think my bunkmate
majored in chaos theory.

18:19.155 --> 18:20.781
What is that?

18:21.698 --> 18:23.534
That doesn't look like Starfleet issue.

18:23.742 --> 18:25.701
That's because I'm not a member
of Starfleet.

18:25.910 --> 18:29.204
Not that I wouldn't be honoured to be
one, sir, especially after spending time...

18:29.412 --> 18:31.123
Who are you?

18:31.706 --> 18:33.374
How do you know
what happened on the Helix?

18:33.582 --> 18:35.417
Did Silik tell you
who he was working for?

18:35.626 --> 18:37.877
I'm the one asking questions,
crewman.

18:39.254 --> 18:41.797
Did he mention
the Temporal Cold War?

18:44.133 --> 18:45.468
What do you know about that?

18:46.385 --> 18:48.512
A great deal more than you do, sir.

18:50.388 --> 18:54.265
If you're not a member of Starfleet,
then who are you?

18:55.433 --> 18:57.977
I work for
a different kind of organization.

18:58.186 --> 19:01.855
We make sure that people like Silik
don't interfere with historical events.

19:02.730 --> 19:04.649
I've never heard of a group like that.

19:05.191 --> 19:07.026
That's because it doesn't exist yet.

19:10.613 --> 19:15.616
So you're telling me
you're some kind of a time traveller?

19:16.158 --> 19:17.868
That's one way of putting it.

19:19.078 --> 19:21.162
Maybe this will help clear things up.

19:24.498 --> 19:27.042
This is how we keep an eye on
what's going on.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.044
You might call it
a temporal observatory.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.966
I know this must seem
a little overwhelming.

19:36.175 --> 19:41.470
Overwhelming doesn't quite cover it.

19:41.678 --> 19:44.681
I come from right about...
Right about here.

19:44.890 --> 19:47.809
Approximately 900 years from now.

19:49.227 --> 19:51.186
Are you human?

19:51.728 --> 19:53.647
More or less.

19:57.108 --> 19:59.193
And the people giving Silik orders?

19:59.443 --> 20:03.947
They are from an earlier century.
From about here.

20:04.572 --> 20:07.115
They can't manifest themselves
physically in the past.

20:07.324 --> 20:11.494
They can only partially materialize
to deliver information.

20:11.702 --> 20:13.162
But not you.

20:13.412 --> 20:16.206
In the years that followed,
we eventually perfected the process.

20:17.207 --> 20:18.501
Sounds dangerous.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.210
When time travel was
first developed,

20:20.418 --> 20:22.962
it wasn't long before people realized
that laws had to be made.

20:23.171 --> 20:24.880
All the species
who had the technology

20:25.088 --> 20:27.341
agreed it would only be used
for research.

20:28.300 --> 20:29.967
But it wasn't.

20:30.176 --> 20:32.761
That's what the Temporal Cold War
is all about.

20:34.596 --> 20:36.306
Look at this.

20:36.932 --> 20:40.476
This is a group of anthropologists
from 2769

20:40.684 --> 20:43.979
observing the construction
of the Great Pyramid at Giza.

20:44.188 --> 20:46.272
They're doing it
using the proper procedures

20:46.481 --> 20:48.775
set forth in the Temporal Accord.

20:48.983 --> 20:52.319
But there are factions
that ignore those procedures.

20:52.736 --> 20:55.321
Why are you telling me all this?

21:00.575 --> 21:04.161
Silik is the one who prevented
the reactor breach.

21:06.748 --> 21:11.043
Are you implying Silik
was sent here to save my ship?

21:12.043 --> 21:14.754
And if he hadn't, we would have
been destroyed today?

21:14.962 --> 21:16.963
I am not implying anything.

21:17.172 --> 21:19.382
All I'm saying is
that I was assigned here

21:19.591 --> 21:21.759
to capture Silik
when he came aboard.

21:21.967 --> 21:26.721
He is a threat, and I need you
to help me capture him.

21:27.597 --> 21:31.724
You're from 900 years in the future,

21:32.303 --> 21:34.169
and you need my help?

21:34.311 --> 21:36.188
The Suliban have been given
genetic enhancements

21:36.396 --> 21:37.938
that allow them to evade
most sensors.

21:38.189 --> 21:42.192
- They're nearly impossible to detect.
- I've noticed.

21:42.817 --> 21:45.195
I have special equipment
that can help track Silik,

21:45.403 --> 21:46.695
but it'll be far more effective

21:46.904 --> 21:49.947
if I can tie it into
your internal sensor grid.

21:50.156 --> 21:54.452
I'll need access to Main Engineering
and your command codes.

21:54.702 --> 21:56.412
But we have reason to believe

21:56.621 --> 21:59.623
that the 22nd century
is a front in this cold war.

21:59.831 --> 22:03.667
What happens here
could affect millennia to come.

22:03.876 --> 22:06.795
It's imperative that we find out
who Silik is working for,

22:07.004 --> 22:08.504
and what they're trying to do.

22:11.882 --> 22:14.760
If I decide to help you...

22:15.385 --> 22:17.512
...I can't do it alone.

22:17.971 --> 22:20.055
I need to inform some of my crew.

22:20.639 --> 22:22.391
The fewer the better.

22:28.146 --> 22:33.983
You're asking me to capture someone
who just saved my ship.

22:35.610 --> 22:37.360
Why should I trust you?

22:38.069 --> 22:40.948
You like your scrambled eggs soft.

22:41.157 --> 22:44.075
Have I ever brought them to you
any other way?

22:48.078 --> 22:51.372
- You're sure you don't want a glass?
- I'm sure.

22:52.457 --> 22:53.958
The Vulcan Science Directorate

22:54.167 --> 22:58.044
has studied the question of time travel
in great detail.

22:58.253 --> 23:02.840
They found no evidence that it exists,
or that it can exist.

23:03.047 --> 23:06.051
The Suliban woman I spoke with,
Sarin,

23:06.427 --> 23:09.178
she also used the phrase
"Temporal Cold War."

23:09.387 --> 23:11.389
- That's what Daniels called it?
- The same words.

23:11.638 --> 23:13.140
That proves nothing.

23:14.725 --> 23:17.560
What about the Suliban's
genetic engineering?

23:17.768 --> 23:20.353
Phlox says it's far beyond
their abilities.

23:20.603 --> 23:24.356
That doesn't mean that it was given
to them by visitors from the future.

23:24.565 --> 23:27.609
Until Daniels can offer you
concrete proof,

23:27.818 --> 23:30.571
I'd remain extremely sceptical.

23:30.821 --> 23:33.614
I'm telling you, he pushed
a button on this device

23:33.823 --> 23:35.700
and the whole room changed.

23:35.908 --> 23:38.201
On the Xyrillian ship,
I was in a holographic chamber

23:38.410 --> 23:41.413
where I could have sworn
I was in a boat at sea.

23:41.620 --> 23:46.541
If what Daniels says is true,
than Silik saved Enterprise.

23:46.749 --> 23:49.419
Maybe we shouldn't
look a gift horse in the mouth.

23:49.627 --> 23:51.920
If there's even a possibility
that this cold war exists,

23:52.170 --> 23:54.132
we can't ignore Daniels' request.

23:55.215 --> 23:57.551
Bridge to Captain Archer.

23:59.385 --> 24:02.430
- Yes, Hoshi.
- We're approaching the protostar, sir,

24:02.680 --> 24:05.140
and the transport ship
is requesting permission to dock.

24:05.348 --> 24:07.433
Some passengers would like
to take you up on your offer

24:07.641 --> 24:09.810
and observe it from the mess hall.

24:11.228 --> 24:14.605
Initiate docking procedures.
I'll be right there.

24:16.399 --> 24:17.733
One of them might be Silik.

24:18.568 --> 24:21.570
We don't have time to debate this
any longer.

24:21.778 --> 24:23.905
I want you to help Daniels.

24:35.914 --> 24:39.166
I always knew we'd be meeting people
from other planets,

24:39.375 --> 24:41.044
but other centuries?

24:44.213 --> 24:46.297
You're not buying any of this,
are you?

24:46.506 --> 24:49.008
If Daniels could travel through time,

24:49.217 --> 24:51.301
why not simply go back
one more day into the past,

24:51.552 --> 24:54.221
and prevent Silik from boarding
this ship in the first place?

24:54.428 --> 24:56.264
Maybe that's plan B.

24:56.806 --> 24:59.099
Or maybe he's really not
from the future.

24:59.724 --> 25:02.269
Then why make up
such a crazy story?

25:02.477 --> 25:05.438
He could be trying to conceal
his true intentions.

25:05.981 --> 25:08.440
I thought you scientists
were supposed to keep an open mind.

25:09.066 --> 25:11.734
There's a difference
between keeping an open mind

25:11.943 --> 25:14.946
and believing something
because you want it to be true.

25:17.781 --> 25:19.908
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

25:32.252 --> 25:35.712
Captain, that is a traditional greeting
on the morning of Agosoria.

25:35.921 --> 25:38.422
It means, "May the Plume
light your way."

25:38.631 --> 25:41.133
- I take it you enjoyed your visit.
- Oh, it was mesmerizing.

25:41.342 --> 25:44.719
Four hours of ritual prayer,
followed by the Kaana-sah,

25:44.928 --> 25:48.847
a series of exercises
designed to purify the body.

25:49.056 --> 25:52.059
I think I strained a leg muscle,
but it was well worth it.

25:52.267 --> 25:54.811
- How many decided to join us?
- Eleven, I believe.

25:55.019 --> 25:57.730
The others wanted to observe the star
from their ship.

25:57.939 --> 26:00.816
So that leaves six on the transport?

26:01.024 --> 26:04.276
I didn't take a head count,
but that sounds about right.

26:05.402 --> 26:07.987
Did any of them seem out of place?

26:08.196 --> 26:09.656
How do you mean?

26:09.864 --> 26:11.407
Did they all take part in the rituals?

26:11.615 --> 26:14.243
As far as I could tell, but our eyes
were closed most of the time.

26:14.451 --> 26:16.954
Is there something wrong, captain?

26:19.289 --> 26:22.500
No, just curious.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.965
You seem a little preoccupied.

26:33.299 --> 26:35.176
It's been a long night.

26:35.760 --> 26:39.430
Glad you had a good time.
Enjoy the view.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.432
I will.

26:43.934 --> 26:45.310
My equipment draws a lot of power.

26:45.519 --> 26:48.604
I'll need another 20 megawatts
routed to your sensor grid.

26:49.230 --> 26:52.440
- Commander?
- The grid can handle it.

26:53.107 --> 26:56.235
So I take it your brother isn't really
an orbital engineer at Jupiter Station.

26:56.443 --> 26:58.028
Actually, I don't have a brother.

26:58.236 --> 27:02.490
- And you didn't grow up in Illinois?
- I'm from a place called Illinois, sir.

27:02.698 --> 27:04.533
Just not the one you're familiar with.

27:04.742 --> 27:07.286
It's good to know Earth
will be around in 900 years.

27:07.494 --> 27:10.121
That depends on how
you define Earth.

27:10.997 --> 27:13.665
- Beg your pardon?
- You might want to initialise the grid.

27:13.874 --> 27:17.001
I'm ready to download
the biometric parameters.

27:17.210 --> 27:19.045
Right.

27:21.421 --> 27:22.589
What's this?

27:23.131 --> 27:25.549
It's very delicate. Please don't...

27:26.592 --> 27:28.386
Please don't touch it.

27:31.096 --> 27:34.057
You know, we've got a little pool
going in Engineering

27:34.265 --> 27:37.809
where we try to guess how far
the ship will travel each day.

27:38.018 --> 27:41.687
I don't suppose you could give me
a tip on tomorrow's distance.

27:41.896 --> 27:44.899
I'm afraid we don't monitor events
quite that closely.

27:45.107 --> 27:46.983
One of the power relays is off-line.

27:47.192 --> 27:49.402
Must have been damaged
during the plasma storm.

27:49.652 --> 27:53.490
J-37. It's about three meters
behind that bulkhead.

27:53.698 --> 27:55.657
I'll take care of it.

27:59.869 --> 28:01.954
J-37?

28:15.716 --> 28:17.050
Try it now.

28:28.517 --> 28:32.312
I know, I know,
your breakfast is two hours late.

28:33.562 --> 28:35.689
Don't give me that look.

28:36.315 --> 28:39.651
If it's any consolation,
I missed my breakfast too.

28:42.695 --> 28:45.072
What's the problem?

28:45.740 --> 28:48.116
You're not getting any cheese.

29:02.210 --> 29:06.089
If you're thinking of calling for help,
I'd advise against it.

29:08.716 --> 29:11.343
I'm not the one you should
be worried about, Jon.

29:12.969 --> 29:14.637
What are you doing here?

29:14.888 --> 29:18.724
I thought you might want to thank me.
I saved your life.

29:19.308 --> 29:21.934
The least you could do
is return the favour.

29:22.476 --> 29:26.772
There's someone here trying
to find me. I need to know who it is.

29:27.523 --> 29:29.441
I don't know what you're talking about.

29:31.359 --> 29:33.986
I detected tachyon radiation.

29:34.194 --> 29:37.655
You don't have anything
that emits tachyons.

29:37.864 --> 29:40.074
Who's looking for me?

29:40.950 --> 29:42.242
I don't know.

29:43.952 --> 29:46.537
Did they tell you that ridiculous story

29:46.746 --> 29:49.749
about their noble efforts
to protect history?

29:49.958 --> 29:52.334
The great Temporal Accord?

29:52.543 --> 29:56.963
They're lying to you, Jon.
None of it is true.

29:57.172 --> 30:01.466
Whoever contacted you
is working for another faction.

30:01.675 --> 30:05.344
They didn't come here to
protect history, they came to alter it.

30:05.845 --> 30:09.180
Who do you think was responsible
for the antimatter cascade

30:09.431 --> 30:11.308
that nearly destroyed your ship?

30:11.516 --> 30:13.058
It was them.

30:13.267 --> 30:15.395
I was sent to prevent it.

30:16.021 --> 30:18.814
And why would you wanna do that?

30:19.356 --> 30:21.691
The first time we met,
you tried to kill me.

30:21.941 --> 30:25.485
I saved your ship
because I was instructed to.

30:25.694 --> 30:29.989
By whom? What does Enterprise
have to do with your Temporal War?

30:31.198 --> 30:36.369
I'm not privy to that kind of information,
but I can tell you this:

30:36.578 --> 30:40.582
Whoever's looking for me
is a danger to your crew.

30:40.790 --> 30:43.917
If you want to continue
on your mission...

30:44.585 --> 30:46.252
...you'll help me find them.

30:47.712 --> 30:49.755
T'Pol to Captain Archer.

30:58.971 --> 31:00.304
Archer here.

31:00.513 --> 31:03.307
We've finished the modifications.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.269
Thanks.

31:06.477 --> 31:11.398
- I'll be there in a few minutes.
- Mr Daniels is eager to get started.

31:12.940 --> 31:14.650
He'll have to wait a few minutes.

31:14.859 --> 31:17.068
Archer out.

31:19.070 --> 31:21.446
You've been very helpful, Jon.

31:41.505 --> 31:43.423
It's beginning.

31:43.631 --> 31:45.633
How long before we see the Plume?

31:45.842 --> 31:50.221
Well, that's hard to predict.
Every cycle is unique.

31:51.805 --> 31:55.849
Would you care to recite
the Invocation of Renewal with us?

31:56.934 --> 31:58.894
I'd be honoured.

32:30.126 --> 32:32.796
- Does this mean it's working?
- It's working.

32:34.505 --> 32:36.674
- What is it?
- Suliban bio-signs.

32:36.883 --> 32:40.469
He's somewhere on this deck.
I can't isolate him, but he's close.

32:40.678 --> 32:43.721
Call Lieutenant Reed.
Tell him to seal off C Deck.

32:44.722 --> 32:47.265
It wouldn't hurt if he could
get down here with a security team.

32:48.809 --> 32:50.060
What's that?

32:53.687 --> 32:55.647
- You two should go.
- We're not leaving.

32:55.855 --> 32:56.898
Go.

32:57.148 --> 32:58.691
Bring help. Go.

32:58.900 --> 33:02.028
Evacuate Engineering! Everybody out!

33:06.990 --> 33:08.991
Did they tell you that the 22nd century

33:09.200 --> 33:11.536
was going to be
your final resting place?

33:23.503 --> 33:25.463
Still sceptical?

33:27.006 --> 33:29.174
Tucker to Captain Archer.

33:29.549 --> 33:31.426
Captain, are you there?

33:33.053 --> 33:34.470
He's in his quarters.

33:34.678 --> 33:36.889
- Tucker to Dr Phlox.
- Yes, commander.

33:37.098 --> 33:39.057
Meet us in the captain's quarters,
on the double.

33:39.265 --> 33:41.184
On my way.

33:58.573 --> 34:00.240
Easy, captain.

34:00.449 --> 34:02.785
Aside from a nasty headache,
you're going to be fine.

34:02.993 --> 34:05.078
You were stunned
by a particle weapon.

34:05.286 --> 34:06.746
It was Silik.

34:06.954 --> 34:10.791
I guess he decided
not to try and kill me this time.

34:10.998 --> 34:14.127
He wasn't quite as generous
when it came to Daniels.

34:14.335 --> 34:15.378
He's dead, sir.

34:18.672 --> 34:22.967
- Have our guests left yet?
- No, the Plume is just beginning.

34:30.097 --> 34:32.224
Enterprise to Captain Fraddock.

34:32.433 --> 34:34.100
Fraddock.

34:34.684 --> 34:36.978
I'm looking for one of your passengers.

34:37.188 --> 34:40.440
Have any of the ones who were here
returned in the last hour or so?

34:40.649 --> 34:43.025
- None.
- You're sure?

34:43.233 --> 34:46.777
The hatch has been sealed
the entire time.

34:47.110 --> 34:50.489
Thanks. Archer out.

34:51.531 --> 34:54.074
- Mr Reed.
- Yes, sir?

34:54.284 --> 34:56.409
We've got a Suliban
loose on the ship.

34:56.659 --> 34:59.746
I want you to lock down
every outer door and exit hatch.

34:59.955 --> 35:01.916
Post security teams on all decks.

35:02.124 --> 35:04.000
Understood.

35:07.420 --> 35:09.713
Do you think you can find him
using Daniels' sensors?

35:09.922 --> 35:11.882
I can sure as hell try.

35:12.089 --> 35:14.800
- Get to Engineering.
- Yes, sir.

35:15.301 --> 35:16.676
T'Pol.

35:16.885 --> 35:18.762
Thanks, doc.

35:32.106 --> 35:33.648
Captain?

35:33.857 --> 35:35.275
It's gone.

35:35.650 --> 35:37.943
- He took it.
- Took what?

35:38.194 --> 35:39.320
The device I told you about.

35:39.528 --> 35:41.906
The one Daniels used
to show me all those things.

35:42.530 --> 35:44.407
That kind of information
could give an advantage

35:44.616 --> 35:46.867
to whomever Silik's working for.

35:47.117 --> 35:49.329
Bridge to Captain Archer.

35:49.579 --> 35:50.787
Go ahead.

35:51.038 --> 35:53.832
Someone just used our com system
to transmit a message.

35:54.082 --> 35:57.543
- What kind of message?
- It's encrypted, sir.

36:12.180 --> 36:13.556
Anything?

36:13.806 --> 36:17.267
I'm sorry, captain. I can't make
heads or tails of most of this.

36:17.475 --> 36:21.729
These might represent Suliban
bio-signs, but I wouldn't bet on it.

36:42.370 --> 36:45.039
B Deck. Service junction 59.

36:45.248 --> 36:48.000
Somebody's trying to bypass
the lock-out codes for Launch Bay 2.

36:49.460 --> 36:51.294
Tell Malcolm to meet me
with a security team.

36:51.502 --> 36:54.505
Captain, I've got something
that might give you a leg up.

36:59.093 --> 37:00.760
It looks like he slipped through here.

37:00.969 --> 37:04.930
We could remove these conduits,
but it'd take some time.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.434
Sir?

37:25.071 --> 37:26.739
Stay here.

37:43.752 --> 37:46.463
Very clever. Careful, Jon.

37:46.672 --> 37:49.800
It'd be a shame to trigger
another antimatter cascade.

37:50.009 --> 37:52.677
There'd be nobody here to stop it.

37:52.885 --> 37:55.303
Put that device on the floor.

37:55.554 --> 37:58.598
It would be in your best interest
to let me take it.

37:58.974 --> 38:01.475
You keep saying you're here
to help us...

38:01.892 --> 38:05.437
...but I can't stop wondering what kind
of genetic enhancements you'll get

38:05.645 --> 38:08.564
for bringing back that little prize.

38:08.814 --> 38:12.484
Eyes in the back of your head?
A pair of wings?

38:12.901 --> 38:15.028
That's a cynical attitude, Jon.

38:15.821 --> 38:19.073
I thought your species
was more trusting.

38:56.477 --> 38:59.064
There's a vessel approaching
no bigger than a shuttlepod.

39:00.940 --> 39:03.109
It's Suliban.

39:13.241 --> 39:15.368
I'm not gonna ask you again.

39:17.994 --> 39:19.454
Put it down.

39:22.207 --> 39:25.584
You're going to kill me,
after I saved your life?

39:30.046 --> 39:33.550
You may have endangered
your future, Jon.

41:03.829 --> 41:06.290
- Bridge to Captain Archer.
- Yeah.

41:06.874 --> 41:09.626
A Suliban vessel just took
something in and went to warp.

41:09.834 --> 41:11.294
Should we go after them?

41:11.795 --> 41:13.587
No.

41:15.255 --> 41:17.381
Let them go.

41:29.517 --> 41:31.560
Come in.

41:33.187 --> 41:37.607
The transport ship has left.
We're ready to resume course.

41:39.191 --> 41:41.318
Have you learned how it works?

41:42.735 --> 41:44.653
Not a clue.

41:48.449 --> 41:51.993
Starfleet's in store
for one hell of a report.

41:54.037 --> 41:56.538
I'm not quite sure where to begin.

41:56.747 --> 41:58.749
I'd be glad to help.

42:01.959 --> 42:03.877
First thing in the morning.

42:04.085 --> 42:06.963
I don't know about you...

42:07.464 --> 42:09.466
...but I could use a good night's sleep.

42:09.674 --> 42:11.760
Agreed.

42:24.644 --> 42:28.063
Mr Reed, assign new quarters
to Daniels' roommate,

42:28.272 --> 42:31.065
and seal off cabin E-14.

42:31.316 --> 42:33.068
It's off-limits till further notice.

42:33.277 --> 42:35.195
Aye, sir.

42:36.696 --> 42:38.363
God knows what else is in there.

42:44.619 --> 42:46.203
Let's get back on the road, Travis.
