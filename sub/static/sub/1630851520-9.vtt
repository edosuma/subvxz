00:04.178 --> 00:07.137
Hmm. I have never decorated
a Christmas tree before.

00:07.181 --> 00:09.139
Do each of these ornaments
have a special meaning?

00:09.183 --> 00:11.881
Yeah, they're all free.

00:11.924 --> 00:15.145
That one I got for opening
a savings account.

00:15.189 --> 00:19.149
That one I got for eating
a 40-ounce rib eye.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.412
That racy one I got in Vegas.

00:21.456 --> 00:23.936
Don't turn it upside down
if there's kids in the room.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.547
Mm.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.505
And where did the tradition
of bringing a tree

00:27.549 --> 00:29.072
into the house come from?

00:29.116 --> 00:30.595
Oh, it goes way, way back.

00:30.639 --> 00:32.858
Yeah. My parents did it,
their parents did it.

00:32.902 --> 00:34.947
Uh, but who did it originally?

00:38.908 --> 00:39.952
Jesus?

00:41.258 --> 00:42.433
Hey.
Hey.

00:42.477 --> 00:43.782
Merry Christmas, everyone.

00:43.826 --> 00:44.914
Hey, Sunshine.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.351
Oh, sorry. Happy holidays, Al.

00:47.395 --> 00:49.092
Oh, you can say
Merry Christmas to me.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.093
Are you sure?

00:50.137 --> 00:51.573
I am sure.

00:51.616 --> 00:53.575
I am the expert
in what you can say to me.

00:55.011 --> 00:56.708
Is this a little muffler?

00:56.752 --> 00:58.710
Yeah, I got that
with an oil change.

00:58.754 --> 01:01.235
Oh, hey, can I talk to you
for a minute?

01:01.278 --> 01:02.801
Sure.

01:05.761 --> 01:07.893
That's a big gift discussion
happening right now.

01:07.937 --> 01:10.070
Someone's getting a PS5.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.723
Ah.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.725
What's up?Hey, so,

01:13.769 --> 01:16.076
keep an open mind,
but would you be okay

01:16.119 --> 01:17.903
if I took Hazel
on Christmas Day?

01:17.947 --> 01:19.905
Oh, that's easy. No.

01:19.949 --> 01:21.603
Look, it would just be
for a few hours.

01:21.646 --> 01:22.952
Freddy's parents really
want to do

01:22.995 --> 01:24.214
something special together.

01:24.258 --> 01:25.650
Oh, Freddy's parents
want to see her?

01:25.694 --> 01:27.217
Why didn't you just tell me?

01:27.261 --> 01:28.740
Of course I'll give up my child
on Christmas

01:28.784 --> 01:30.481
so your boyfriend's parents
can see her.

01:30.525 --> 01:31.482
You could just say no.

01:31.526 --> 01:32.527
That's what I led with.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.791
Not assuming anything,

01:35.834 --> 01:39.621
but Game-Zone offers
military discounts.

01:39.664 --> 01:41.971
They're open till 9:00.

01:55.985 --> 01:58.118
Hey, Riley. What you drinking?

01:58.161 --> 02:00.598
Ginger ale? Glass of milk?

02:00.642 --> 02:01.773
Ha, ha.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.775
So, how you doing?

02:03.819 --> 02:05.342
Eh, so-so.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.301
Gave my number to this guy
a couple weeks ago.

02:07.344 --> 02:08.998
Thought we had a moment.

02:09.041 --> 02:11.087
Thinking about spitting
in his beer.

02:13.045 --> 02:16.832
Well, he sounds like a jerk,
a handsome jerk.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.487
Look, I was gonna call.

02:19.530 --> 02:23.143
Things in my life
are kind of messy,

02:23.186 --> 02:24.970
I figured you wouldn't
want to deal with it.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.885
I can deal with a lot.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.149
Back in the Navy,
I was the one who had to tell

02:29.192 --> 02:32.456
200 angry sailors
when we were out of corn bread.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.502
[chuckles]

02:37.331 --> 02:38.506
[phone ringing]

02:40.508 --> 02:41.639
This is Holly.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.641
Hi, Holly, it's Riley.

02:43.685 --> 02:47.079
I was wondering
if I could buy you dinner?

02:47.123 --> 02:49.604
Riley who?

02:51.954 --> 02:54.478
Hassina, tell me what
this makes you think of.

02:54.522 --> 02:55.697
["Jingle Bells"
playing over phone]

02:57.699 --> 03:00.092
That's the song all
the ice cream men play in Kabul.

03:00.136 --> 03:04.749
Get this, it is a Christmas song
here, so it is always playing.

03:04.793 --> 03:07.012
Are you craving
ice cream all the time?

03:07.056 --> 03:09.667
All the time.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.930
Luckily, they sell ice cream
in every store.

03:11.974 --> 03:14.063
Even hardware stores have it.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.849
Oh. Where have you been?

03:17.893 --> 03:18.894
Date.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.069
It's 9:00 a.m.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.723
Good date.

03:22.724 --> 03:23.768
Oh, Hassina.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.683
Salaam. How are you?

03:25.727 --> 03:28.860
Not as good as you.
Look at that smile.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.688
Yeah, I went on a date
with Holly.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.690
Holly the alcohol seller?

03:32.734 --> 03:34.257
Yep.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.780
Bro, she's got a Harley.

03:35.824 --> 03:37.521
We rode all over the city.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.523
I've never sat in back before.

03:39.567 --> 03:40.916
I thought it would be
emasculating,

03:40.959 --> 03:44.224
but it gave me more time
to look around.

03:44.267 --> 03:45.529
I'm happy for you, Riley.

03:45.573 --> 03:47.575
Don't forget to invite me
to your wedding.

03:47.618 --> 03:49.968
Okay, bye, Hassina.

03:50.012 --> 03:53.407
Oh, my gosh, dude,
we had so much fun.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.973
She's got throwing knives.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.801
Throwing knives.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.150
And we were naked.

03:58.194 --> 03:59.413
That's not necessary
for the story,

03:59.456 --> 04:00.936
I'm just painting a picture.

04:03.286 --> 04:06.158
So, uh, what about Vanessa?

04:06.202 --> 04:08.422
All you've been talking about
is trying to get her back.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.162
Maybe I'm wasting my time.

04:10.206 --> 04:11.903
I did everything
she asked me to do.

04:11.947 --> 04:14.558
I got a therapist,
applied for disability.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.081
What's it get me?

04:16.125 --> 04:17.779
She's going to Freddy's parents'
for Christmas.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.563
She might be testing you.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.391
Who cares if she is?

04:21.435 --> 04:23.567
Holly likes me the way I am now.

04:23.611 --> 04:24.916
She likes me a lot.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.135
In fact,

04:26.178 --> 04:27.179
this morning she...

04:27.223 --> 04:28.616
Do not paint a picture.

04:32.881 --> 04:34.186
In the Christmas movies,

04:34.230 --> 04:36.276
people come to your house
and sing at you.

04:36.319 --> 04:39.279
Yeah, it's a seasonal form
of torture called caroling.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.845
Will people be doing it here?

04:40.889 --> 04:43.413
Not if Dad's sprinklers
still work.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.937
[chuckles] They do.
Checked them this morning.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.287
[knocking on door]

04:47.330 --> 04:49.593
Hello?Hey, in here!

04:49.637 --> 04:51.639
You're not supposed
to eat raw eggs,

04:51.682 --> 04:54.337
but I've had half this bowl
and I feel fine.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.338
Huh.

04:55.382 --> 04:56.774
Hello, Merry Christmas.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.210
Hello, Lois.How are you?

04:58.254 --> 05:00.517
Happy holidays, Al.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.780
You're right, it happens a lot.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.347
Merry Christmas, Lois.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.348
What you got there?

05:05.392 --> 05:06.480
It's your Christmas present.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.220
I can put it under the tree

05:08.264 --> 05:10.310
or you can open it right now
and wear it

05:10.353 --> 05:11.963
to your Christmas party.

05:12.007 --> 05:14.662
So I guess it's not
the socket wrenches I asked for.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.059
Oh, holy moly.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.539
It's so soft.

05:22.583 --> 05:23.975
Al, feel this.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.716
In Afghanistan, we
have the softest...

05:25.760 --> 05:28.328
Oh, wow.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.634
If you don't like it,
I can take it back.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.723
You better not.

05:32.767 --> 05:33.898
Ah, you look great.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.509
He does, doesn't he?

05:35.552 --> 05:37.511
It fits him so well.
Where'd you get it?

05:37.554 --> 05:40.165
Brunello Cucinelli.

05:40.209 --> 05:42.820
I never say this unless
I'm holding a gigantic fish,

05:42.864 --> 05:44.605
but take my picture.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.479
So, you let a naked woman
throw a knife at you?

05:49.523 --> 05:53.353
Let her? Doc, I dared her.

05:53.396 --> 05:54.484
You want to know what I think?

05:54.528 --> 05:57.531
You just described my job.

05:57.574 --> 06:00.708
I think the reason Vanessa
and I are always butting heads

06:00.751 --> 06:03.014
is because she wasn't
in the service.

06:03.058 --> 06:04.842
Holly's been deployed,
she gets me.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.366
Like you.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.716
So now I'm wondering,
if I had been with Holly

06:08.759 --> 06:10.108
all this time,

06:10.152 --> 06:12.676
would I be having
all these problems?

06:12.720 --> 06:15.505
You know there's a difference
between the start

06:15.549 --> 06:18.116
of a relationship
and the end of one.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.596
Yeah, but I don't
have to explain

06:19.640 --> 06:21.511
every little thing to her.

06:21.555 --> 06:22.860
She's been through it.

06:22.904 --> 06:27.038
Like, it's so hot
she's been to Okinawa.

06:27.082 --> 06:28.910
So have I.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.216
Don't wreck it.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.131
[chuckles]

06:33.175 --> 06:35.264
So, what do we do when
I have a breakthrough?

06:35.307 --> 06:37.745
Go out for beers?
Fire up stogies?

06:37.788 --> 06:41.401
You had a date.
Let's not get carried away.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.403
But...

06:43.446 --> 06:45.405
you can't talk about cigars
and not have one.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.450
[laughs]

06:51.280 --> 06:52.934
What do you want
for Christmas, Dad?

06:52.977 --> 06:54.892
Just to spend time
with you, baby.

06:54.936 --> 06:57.112
Great, crossing you off my list.

07:00.811 --> 07:03.074
Hey, uh...

07:03.118 --> 07:04.989
how would you feel
if I brought a friend

07:05.033 --> 07:06.556
to Grampy's Christmas party?

07:06.600 --> 07:08.253
A friend, huh?

07:08.297 --> 07:10.255
Yes. A friend.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.127
Is it a girlfriend?

07:12.170 --> 07:13.955
Maybe.

07:13.998 --> 07:16.436
Say it. Say "girlfriend."

07:17.698 --> 07:18.916
I won't bring her
if it's weird for you.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.657
No, you can bring her.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.746
Mom has Freddy.
You can bring someone.

07:22.790 --> 07:25.619
Thanks. I think you'll like her.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.316
Mind if I bring my boyfriend?

07:27.359 --> 07:28.535
What?

07:30.493 --> 07:31.625
Too easy.

07:36.804 --> 07:39.502
Might not want to stand there.

07:39.546 --> 07:40.503
Why not?

07:40.547 --> 07:41.678
Mistletoe.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.811
That sad little bush?

07:44.812 --> 07:46.378
If you're under it
with another person,

07:46.422 --> 07:47.815
you're supposed to kiss.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.686
Ah, sort of like when the camera
turns on you

07:49.730 --> 07:50.861
at a baseball game.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.950
No, it's...

07:52.994 --> 07:54.865

07:54.909 --> 07:57.128
Well, thank you for warning me.

08:04.005 --> 08:05.485

08:05.528 --> 08:06.834
We wouldn't miss it.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.705
That is one nice sweater.

08:08.749 --> 08:10.490
Thank you.
May I?

08:10.533 --> 08:12.013
I insist.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.536
Oh, yeah.

08:13.580 --> 08:14.798
Right?
Oof.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.800
The craftsmanship
is extraordinary,

08:16.844 --> 08:19.847
and I say that
as an experienced yarn worker.

08:19.890 --> 08:22.327
Yep, Freddy made this one
for me. Isn't it great?

08:22.371 --> 08:23.807
So colorful.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.548
All I see are my mistakes.

08:27.898 --> 08:28.899
There she is.

08:28.943 --> 08:29.900
Hi, Dad.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.511
Hey.[grunts]

08:31.554 --> 08:32.816
This is my friend I
was telling you about.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.688
Hi, Hazel. I'm Holly.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.646
I like your Chucks.Oh, thanks.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.822
I like your shoes.
Are they uncomfortable?

08:38.866 --> 08:40.737
You have no idea.

08:40.781 --> 08:43.566
Looks like it.
I'm gonna go do a lap.

08:46.047 --> 08:47.091
She's cool.

08:47.135 --> 08:48.658
Told you.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.834
So, uh, who's that?

08:50.878 --> 08:52.009
Who, Holly?

08:52.053 --> 08:53.707
That's Holly.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.579
And how do we know Holly?

08:56.623 --> 08:59.016
She works at the VFW bar.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.192
Yeah, she and Riley have been
hanging out for a week or so.

09:01.236 --> 09:02.542
Mm-hmm.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.413
And he's bringing her
to Christmas?

09:04.456 --> 09:06.894
Uh, let me check. Yes.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.420
Here you go.

09:12.943 --> 09:14.554
And one for you.

09:14.597 --> 09:19.167
And you don't drink,
but everybody loves magic.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.473
What?!

09:25.260 --> 09:28.698
Is it weird for you
to see them do that?

09:28.742 --> 09:30.482
No.
[chuckles]

09:30.526 --> 09:33.442
'Cause it's weird for me
to watch you watch them.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.581
What are those, Dad?

09:41.624 --> 09:44.758
We ran out of pigs.
They're just getting blankets.

09:44.801 --> 09:47.587
Hey, Art, where
would I find ice?

09:47.630 --> 09:50.328
Oh, come on, Holly.
You're a guest. Enjoy the party.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.635
It's in the
garage freezer.Copy that.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.289
Good sweater, Dad.

09:54.332 --> 09:55.986
I know, right?

09:56.030 --> 09:57.988
Ooh, looking good.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.990
I'm gonna get, like,
seven more of these.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.252
[chuckles]

10:01.296 --> 10:03.603
[chuckles]
I don't think so.

10:03.646 --> 10:04.908
Why not?

10:04.952 --> 10:07.258
Does the name
"Brunello Cucinelli"

10:07.302 --> 10:08.825
mean anything to you?

10:08.869 --> 10:11.611
Was he in The Godfather?

10:11.654 --> 10:15.919
He's a designer, and he makes
very expensive sweaters.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.268
How expensive?

10:17.312 --> 10:19.749
If the house catches fire,

10:19.793 --> 10:22.839
save the sweater, then
come back for Riley.

10:25.712 --> 10:28.149
I know what
you're thinking.

10:28.192 --> 10:30.934
You didn't know my bedroom
was gonna be this sexy.

10:30.978 --> 10:33.458
I'm wondering
whose ribbon rack you stole.

10:33.502 --> 10:36.113
There is no way
you earned all that chest candy.

10:36.157 --> 10:39.682
[scoffs]You still have no idea
how impressive I am.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.641
Oh, you hide it well.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.468
[laughs]

10:43.512 --> 10:45.122
I'm bored.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.908
Me, too.You are?

10:49.387 --> 10:52.390
You want to shoot some hoops?Really?

10:52.434 --> 10:54.697
As long as you're okay
with getting schooled.

10:54.741 --> 10:57.874
In those shoes?
I don't think so.

11:01.922 --> 11:04.228
[clears throat]

11:04.272 --> 11:07.710
Riley, some people are saying
they want to go caroling.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.799
Who?

11:09.843 --> 11:11.801
Just people.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.498
With songs in their heart.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.109
We don't want
to disappoint the people.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.112
Hey, can I talk
to you for a minute?

11:19.635 --> 11:22.725
Okay, I'll let everyone know
you're on board.

11:22.769 --> 11:26.511
You're kidding, right? Bringing
some random girl to Christmas?

11:26.555 --> 11:29.340
She's not random, and I don't
know what your problem is.

11:29.384 --> 11:30.907
Uh, my problem is
that you're doing it

11:30.951 --> 11:32.343
right in front of our daughter.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.084
I talked to her about it.
She's cool.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.825
Besides, you brought Freddy.

11:35.869 --> 11:38.349
Great party, man.
Thanks for having us.

11:38.393 --> 11:39.742
Thank you, Freddy.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.613
I'm glad you both could make it.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.747
You think it's a good idea
for me to do my magic trick?

11:44.791 --> 11:48.708
No.It's just that Mrs. Foster is
going to early Mass, so...

11:48.751 --> 11:49.883
No, Freddy.

11:51.232 --> 11:52.537
Stop smiling.

11:52.581 --> 11:53.930
[laughing]:
I can't.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.720
Al says you want
to go caroling?

12:00.763 --> 12:02.852
I did not say that.

12:02.896 --> 12:05.725
Okay, that makes more sense.

12:05.768 --> 12:07.857
Where's your sweater?

12:07.901 --> 12:09.859
I didn't want anyone
spilling anything on it.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.122
Oh, come on. If you're not
gonna wear it for Christmas,

12:12.166 --> 12:14.559
when are you
gonna wear it?I'll find a time.

12:14.603 --> 12:16.910
You know, if you don't like
it, you can just tell me.

12:16.953 --> 12:20.043
I love it. It's just, do you
know how much that thing costs?

12:20.087 --> 12:21.741
Don't worry about it.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.307
How can I not worry about it?

12:23.351 --> 12:26.310
I drive three towns over
for the cheap gas.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.312
If it's not your thing,
it's not your thing.

12:28.356 --> 12:29.923
It's not. I mean,

12:29.966 --> 12:32.360
what kind of person wears
a sweater that costs so much?

12:33.361 --> 12:35.232
I do.Seriously?

12:35.276 --> 12:38.148
What if it shrinks in the dryer?
What happens if you get moths?

12:38.192 --> 12:40.934
After you die,
does your family fight over it,

12:40.977 --> 12:43.066
or do you bury yourself
in it like King Tut?

12:43.110 --> 12:45.329
Are you done?

12:45.373 --> 12:48.245
I'm not trying to offend you,
but come on. [chuckles]

12:48.289 --> 12:50.639
Well, I am offended.

12:50.682 --> 12:53.947
And you don't
put it in the dryer.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.779
Mmm.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.911
You know,
Riley's just doing this

13:01.955 --> 13:03.608
to get a rise out of me.
[laughs]

13:03.652 --> 13:05.088
Take it easy on the punch.

13:05.132 --> 13:07.308
It's making you... talk.

13:08.309 --> 13:11.355
This is his father's party,
and he's ruining it.

13:11.399 --> 13:14.315
He's ruining
his father's party.

13:14.358 --> 13:18.145
Does anyone feel like caroling?
I hear it's fun.

13:18.188 --> 13:21.844
You know, not to mention,
he's using that poor girl.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.715
I'm gonna go
set him straight.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.717
Don't.What?

13:25.761 --> 13:27.850
Knock it off.
You're embarrassing me.

13:27.894 --> 13:31.288
I'm just saying
what everyone's thinking.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.290
Are you kidding?
You've been throwing a fit

13:33.334 --> 13:35.640
since we got here 'cause,
what, your ex has a date?

13:35.684 --> 13:37.860
Okay...I thought
you were here with me.

13:37.904 --> 13:40.558
I am. Just sit down.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.823
Thank your dad
for the nice party.

13:47.348 --> 13:49.959
Hmm.

13:50.003 --> 13:54.137
Maybe I will just
go caroling by myself.

13:54.181 --> 13:56.661
What the hell is wrong
with everyone?

13:56.705 --> 13:59.664
Vanessa, I love you,
but the only reason

13:59.708 --> 14:01.449
you're angry is because
Riley's happy.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.713
Leave him alone.

14:07.281 --> 14:10.197
[humming "Jingle Bells"]

14:12.416 --> 14:15.158
Uh, Mr. Art, you're not wearing
your beautiful sweater.

14:15.202 --> 14:18.205
It's in my bedroom
under the Picasso.

14:18.248 --> 14:21.164
Okay. Where's Lois?

14:21.208 --> 14:24.211
I don't know.
Probably out buying me a yacht.

14:24.254 --> 14:26.909
[phone ringing]

14:26.953 --> 14:28.389
Salaam, Hassina Jaan.

14:28.432 --> 14:29.912
HASSINA:
Salaam.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.348
How's the Christmas?

14:31.392 --> 14:35.004
Oh, it is wonderful
and magical, and...

14:35.048 --> 14:38.529
It is crazy.
Everyone is fighting.

14:38.573 --> 14:39.922
So, it's not like
in the movies?

14:39.966 --> 14:42.577
No, except for maybe
Die Hard.

14:45.928 --> 14:49.236
So how long have you
and my dad been... friends?

14:49.279 --> 14:51.107
We've been friends
for a couple of years,

14:51.151 --> 14:54.763
and "friends" for about a week.

14:56.852 --> 14:58.288
Oh. Hey!

14:58.332 --> 15:01.639
We out here playing basketball
or Barbies?

15:01.683 --> 15:04.425
Okay, I see you.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.255
So, what's the plan
with you guys?

15:08.298 --> 15:11.388
Man, you really drive
to the basket, don't you?

15:11.432 --> 15:12.781
I'm just trying to figure out

15:12.824 --> 15:14.870
whether it's worth
learning your last name.

15:17.351 --> 15:20.658
Beat me to 11,
maybe I'll tell you.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.488
Come on. Come on.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.495
Hey.

15:31.539 --> 15:33.280
Hey.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.935
Your party's going great.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.981
I mean, it's usually not the
host who leaves early, but...

15:43.725 --> 15:45.466
I don't know
what to tell you.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.121
I'm a simple guy.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.775
With a lot of opinions.[sighs]

15:50.819 --> 15:53.865
It's just who I am,
and I'm too old to change.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.476
[chuckles]

15:55.519 --> 15:56.999
I don't mind
that you have money.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.001
Y-You obviously do.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.351
But I earned it, and
I want to spend it

16:01.395 --> 16:04.485
on things that make
me happy, which was you

16:04.528 --> 16:07.357
until two hours ago.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.536
So, what do we do?

16:12.580 --> 16:16.323
Well, first, you
apologize for being rude.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.499
I think I did that.You did not.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.936
Oh.

16:21.893 --> 16:24.200
I am so sorry.

16:25.245 --> 16:29.379
And you don't get to make me
feel bad for the choices I make.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.904
So, you want me
to get my head around the fact

16:32.948 --> 16:37.300
that you're rich
and sexy and generous?

16:37.344 --> 16:39.955
I'll give it a shot.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.002
You're very brave.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.657
And next year,

16:46.701 --> 16:49.182
I'll give you
those socket wrenches.

16:49.225 --> 16:53.012
Next year? I like
the sound of that.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.759
Want to stick around
for the after-party?

17:01.803 --> 17:03.935
You gonna wear the sweater?

17:03.979 --> 17:05.154
That's all I'm gonna wear.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.200
[laughs]

17:13.728 --> 17:17.079
Hey. What are you doing in here?

17:17.123 --> 17:19.603
I drank too much.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.606
Where's your girlfriend?

17:22.650 --> 17:26.262
She went home.
Where's your boyfriend?

17:26.306 --> 17:28.395
He went home.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.528
Everyone's pissed at me.

17:31.572 --> 17:33.617
What did I do?

17:33.661 --> 17:36.359
[sighs]
Well...

17:36.403 --> 17:40.624
you are half in the bag and were
rude to everyone at the party.

17:40.668 --> 17:43.932
Kind of stole
my move there.

17:43.975 --> 17:46.195
I put up with so much from you.

17:46.239 --> 17:49.459
You were a mess for years,
and you cheated on me.

17:49.503 --> 17:51.461
You refused to get help.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.898
I'm so mad.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.074
[sighs]

17:55.117 --> 17:56.901
You're right.

17:56.945 --> 18:01.080
I'm sorry. I really am,
and I'm working on it.

18:01.123 --> 18:05.432
If you get better, and then
she gets you, how is that fair?

18:05.475 --> 18:07.651
Where is that coming from?

18:07.695 --> 18:09.784
I don't know.

18:12.656 --> 18:13.918
Are you saying

18:13.962 --> 18:16.443
you want
to give us another chance?

18:17.444 --> 18:18.793
I don't know.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.666
Oh, God.

18:22.710 --> 18:25.060
I hate being the messy one.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.153
Look,

18:31.197 --> 18:33.155
what if you're
better with Freddy,

18:33.199 --> 18:35.026
and I'm better
with someone else?

18:40.162 --> 18:42.208
Can you just leave me alone?

18:49.911 --> 18:52.174
I'll get you some water,
some coffee and a bucket.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.568
[groans softly]Maybe not in that order.
