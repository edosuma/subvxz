WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:02.200
Previously on "October Road"

00:02.300 --> 00:03.400
We're almost good, Nick.

00:03.400 --> 00:06.200
We just--We gotta get out some kinks.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.400
You're broke.

00:07.400 --> 00:08.500
What do you mean, 

00:08.500 --> 00:10.500
We're couple now.
We should do couple-y things.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.900
It's important to me, Eddie.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.600
Maybe until you're ready to step outside,

00:14.600 --> 00:16.400
I could be your window onto the world.

00:17.100 --> 00:17.800
Hi, Owen.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.800
-You guys know each other?
-Owen is my ex-husband.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.300
Ex-Husband, huh?

00:22.300 --> 00:23.300
It's a figure of speech.

00:23.300 --> 00:24.600
You have to knock it off with Ikey.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.300
You have to forgive him.
You can't--You can't stay mad.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.400
It's a terrible thing,
having no friends.

We're coming for ya!

00:42.500 --> 00:43.600
Where are you?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.600
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.300
We're gonna find you.

01:01.500 --> 01:04.000
We're coming for ya.

01:10.100 --> 01:11.500
I can hear you!

01:21.700 --> 01:23.300
Where the heck are you?

01:32.200 --> 01:33.500
I need a second!

01:33.500 --> 01:35.000
You can't call time-out.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.600
You gotta call 'em before we start.
Let him catch his breath.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.400
Yeah, when did you become 
such a fascist, Ike?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.700
You don't even know
what "fascist" means, Owen.

01:44.700 --> 01:45.800
I do.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
Name it.

01:48.200 --> 01:52.800
It's a political philosophy that places
the nation and the race above the individual.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.000
Phil!

01:54.000 --> 01:56.700
Exactly.
I was gonna say that.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.800
Come on!

02:00.000 --> 02:01.200
-What is it?
-Over there.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.400
-Where?
-In the bushes.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.200
Hey!

02:18.000 --> 02:19.600
Well, what have we got here?

02:20.600 --> 02:23.100
It's the five fairies
of the apocalypse, guys.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.900
We don't want trouble.

02:25.700 --> 02:26.800
Oh, is that so?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.200
Well, that's too bad, buddy, 
'cause we do.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.600
Let's beat them soft boys.
Who-di-who.

02:35.600 --> 02:36.400
Yeah!

02:36.900 --> 02:38.100
Sissies.
Hey!

02:41.000 --> 02:42.400
Aah! What the hell?!

02:44.100 --> 02:45.600
Aah! Ow! Ow!

02:46.400 --> 02:47.800
Aah! Aah!

02:52.300 --> 02:54.900
That's right, freaks.
You mess with us,

02:54.900 --> 02:57.500
You mess with the demons
of Dalton Woods.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.000
We'll finish
you losers off later!

03:00.000 --> 03:02.100
-Get out, Cataldo.
-Come on, boys.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.000
Man, Nicky.
Man, that was all-time.

03:06.300 --> 03:10.200
Man, you were like John Cassavetes
in "A Rosemary's Baby."

03:11.100 --> 03:11.900
Says you.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.800
I was going more for a Nikki Sixx
in Motley Crue thing.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.400
Whatever, man.
That rocked.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.400
You can come out now, 
superhero.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.300
Are you guys okay?

03:38.300 --> 03:40.000
Angela, 
that was all-time--

03:40.000 --> 03:42.200
All-time!
You're the man.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.700
If somebody's gotta
save your sorry butts, 

03:45.000 --> 03:46.200
Figured it'd be a girl.

03:46.700 --> 03:47.700
I gotta jet.

03:47.900 --> 03:50.700
Come over tonight if you guys
wanna watch "90210."

03:51.300 --> 03:54.900
Later, skaters, waiters
and smelly cheese graters.

03:54.900 --> 03:56.100
See ya!

04:21.000 --> 04:23.200
Broke? Like, broke broke?

04:23.200 --> 04:24.300
Yeah, broke broke.

04:25.100 --> 04:28.200
As in I may need to hold a bake sale
to pay for those eggs you just ate.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.700
How does that happen?

04:31.300 --> 04:33.700
I don't know.
Bad investments?

04:34.100 --> 04:36.500
Market downtick?
Recession.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.100
Things that
I don't know about, 

04:39.100 --> 04:41.400
Which is why I have
a business manager--

04:41.400 --> 04:43.800
Had a business manager, 

04:43.800 --> 04:47.200
Because now there's no 
business to manage.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.800
Oh, man.

04:50.100 --> 04:51.300
I'm sorry?

04:52.600 --> 04:54.600
I mean, 
it's kinda my own fault

04:54.600 --> 04:56.700
The whole finance world
is a mystery to me.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.200
My--My business manager--
He'd call me up, 

04:59.200 --> 05:02.900
And he'd ask me about
bond options, and I'd say, 

05:02.900 --> 05:05.600
"Other than Sean Connery, 
Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan?

05:06.100 --> 05:08.400
'Cause I don't know
what you're talking about."

05:09.400 --> 05:11.000
You could always
put pen to paper.

05:12.900 --> 05:13.800
Pen to paper?

05:13.800 --> 05:15.700
Mm. As in writing.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.700
You know, 
that thing you used to do.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.300
It's not that simple.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.200
Why not? I mean, 
you're a hotshot novelist.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.800
Your book is beloved, 
voice-of-a-generation style.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.400
Guaranteed, 
at the bare minimum, 

05:27.400 --> 05:31.300
There are dozens of magazines
who would pay you to write something.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.400
No.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.100
No what?

05:35.100 --> 05:38.800
Just... no, all right?

05:38.800 --> 05:40.400
Don't worry about it.
I'll figure it out, okay?

05:40.400 --> 05:42.300
-You don't need to worry about it.
-Okay, I was just trying to help.

05:42.300 --> 05:47.100
Yeah, well, finish your coffee, 
get out here ok? That will be help

05:50.400 --> 05:52.800
-Are you joking, dude?
-What?

05:54.600 --> 05:55.900
Fine. Whatever.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.400
I'll just see you later, 
okay?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Ok.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
You need to start dealing, 
you know that?

06:13.800 --> 06:17.400
Can I just say that nothing pleases me more

06:17.400 --> 06:21.300
Than getting to expose my lady to
"The Dirty Dozen" for the very first time?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.700
Well, can I just say
that nothing pleases me more

06:23.700 --> 06:27.000
Than being exposed to
"The Dirty Dozen" for the very first time?

06:28.300 --> 06:29.600
Lee Marvin

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
The last of the real men.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.400
Grizzled and great
and gray-haired...

06:47.800 --> 06:48.800
Where are you going?

06:49.200 --> 06:50.200
Salsa run.

06:50.300 --> 06:51.200
You want me to pause it?

06:51.500 --> 06:52.400
No, it's okay.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.500
<i>And your stupid old 
grandfather refused to go</i>

07:06.000 --> 07:07.900
<i>He said, and I quote, </i>

07:08.800 --> 07:11.100
<i>"Musicals make me sleepy."</i>

07:12.000 --> 07:13.600
<i>Why are you
telling her this?</i>

07:14.700 --> 07:16.400
<i>After all these years, </i>

07:16.400 --> 07:18.600
<i>After all those musicals
that we went to, </i>

07:18.600 --> 07:21.300
<i>He napped
through every one of them.</i>

07:21.800 --> 07:25.100
<i>I remember
a particularly good sleep</i>

07:25.200 --> 07:27.100
<i>During "Oklahoma!"</i>

07:27.200 --> 07:28.800
<i>See what I deal with?</i>

07:29.700 --> 07:32.300
Come visit us soon, Jenny.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.100
So can we go?

07:38.000 --> 07:38.700
Where?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.200
To Providence.
To visit them in the nursing home.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.700
I haven't been since January.

07:44.300 --> 07:45.300
Please?

07:46.500 --> 07:48.600
I-I don't know.
I hate nursing homes.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.700
They're so...

07:49.700 --> 07:51.200
Full of old people?

07:51.500 --> 07:52.600
Exactly

07:54.700 --> 07:57.000
-Eddie?
-Well, you go.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.000
Well, I want you to meet them.
It's important to me.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.600
Yeah, I will
one of these days.

08:02.700 --> 08:05.400
"One of these days"?
They're in their 80s, Eddie.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.200
-I just...
-What, Eddie?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.400
Where are we?

08:09.400 --> 08:11.200
Where are we
in this relationship?

08:11.500 --> 08:13.100
I can tell you one place we're not.

08:13.100 --> 08:14.600
And where's that?

08:14.600 --> 08:15.900
The nursing home.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.500
I just don't get why everything
has to be such a big deal--

08:22.500 --> 08:23.600
Everything.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.400
Now this is what happens.
Yup.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.500
It's all good and then...

08:27.500 --> 08:29.500
Quite suddenly, it's not anymore.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.800
It's like an endurance race.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.799
And the finish line doesn't exist.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.000
I have to say something to her.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.500
Mm. You should, Phys.

08:35.500 --> 08:36.200
Right?

08:36.200 --> 08:39.500
Who walks out on "The Dirty Dozen"
and doesn't feel the 
need to hit "pause"?

08:39.500 --> 08:41.500
Girls. Girls do.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.100
Women.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.200
Yeah, yeah.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.000
I'm going to my room

08:45.000 --> 08:48.700
In attempt to commit hari-kari
with a spork.

08:48.700 --> 08:50.300
I don't know.
Maybe I'm being a jerk, 

08:50.300 --> 08:55.000
But to drive all the way to rhode island
just to hang out with her grandparents?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.500
You didn't sign up for that.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.900
No way. Not even close.

08:57.900 --> 08:58.500
Thank you.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.200
No.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.400
Don't worry about it.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.700
That's her issues, not yours.

09:02.700 --> 09:03.500
You know what I mean?

09:03.500 --> 09:05.300
What she's doing is projecting.

09:05.300 --> 09:06.700
Yes!

09:06.700 --> 09:10.100
You okay, Phil?

09:10.100 --> 09:12.000
She's dead.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.400
Who's dead?

09:13.400 --> 09:14.700
Angela.

09:14.700 --> 09:15.400
Angela who?

09:15.400 --> 09:19.300
Angela Ferilli.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.200
She died in a car crash.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.400
Angela Ferilli's dead.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.800
Later, skaters, waiters

09:36.800 --> 09:39.200
And smelly cheese graters.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.600
See ya!

09:59.400 --> 10:03.000
Angela Ferilli is the coolest girl
ever born.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.800
She could be president one day.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.300
Ikey, am I wrong?

10:06.300 --> 10:07.600
You ain't wrong, 

10:07.600 --> 10:08.700
You got that right.

10:08.700 --> 10:11.600
Did you see her come out
with that slingshot?

10:11.600 --> 10:14.200
That was all-time!

10:25.400 --> 10:29.300
"Angela Bear, the former Angela Ferilli, 

10:29.300 --> 10:34.500
"Died April 9th in an auto accident
in Bishop Flats, Mass.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.500
"Survived by her husband Robert Bear

10:37.500 --> 10:40.600
"And their daughter Susie...

10:40.600 --> 10:46.500
Parents, yada-yada.

10:46.500 --> 10:49.400
April 9th? That was yesterday.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.700
She was still living in the flats.

10:57.300 --> 10:58.600
Right. Yeah... She was.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.300
Robert Bear...

11:02.300 --> 11:04.400
She married a guy named Robert Bear.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.000
She did.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.900
Hmm.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.600
I'll bet he's handsome.

11:12.200 --> 11:15.600
Angela's dead.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.200
That's crazy.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.000
This isn't right.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.100
I told you. Unavoidable.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.300
Mom got a job teaching in the district.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.900
We got schools.
We got districts.

11:26.900 --> 11:29.700
Bishop Flats is only three towns away.

11:29.700 --> 11:31.900
You guys need to come visit.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.300
Send me some of your stories, Nick,

11:35.300 --> 11:37.700
Especially the ghost ones.

11:37.700 --> 11:38.900
I will.

11:38.900 --> 11:41.800
Try not to let the headmaster
pinch you in the butt, Ikey.

11:41.800 --> 11:45.300
He does, I'll knee him
in the chestnuts.

11:45.300 --> 11:48.000
And you be nice to the girls, Latekka.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.400
I promise.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.700
My birthday's in two months, Owen.

11:52.700 --> 11:55.300
I'm gonna have a party at my new house.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.100
Make sure you guys come to
the Flats for it.

11:57.100 --> 11:57.900
I will.

11:57.900 --> 11:59.000
You better.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.100
I can turn into a butterfly, 
a bat or a bulldog, 

12:02.100 --> 12:05.100
And if you don't come see me, 
I'll come haunt you.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.200
We are so there.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.500
I hate butterflies and bats.

12:16.300 --> 12:19.700
I think I'll miss you most
of all, Scarecrow.

12:19.700 --> 12:22.500
Never cut that 
Sebastian-Bach hair, Phil.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.100
Sebastian Bach is lame.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.500
Skid Row's stupid.

12:25.500 --> 12:29.800
Sebastian Bach is an angel
in devil's shoes.

12:29.800 --> 12:33.900
"I Remember You" is the best song
in the history of songs.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.400
Yeah, it is a pretty good one.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.100
I gotta go.

12:43.400 --> 12:47.800
Later, skaters, waiters
and smelly cheese graters.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
What are we gonna do now?

13:04.700 --> 13:07.400
Daddy, what are we gonna do
for custody day?

13:07.400 --> 13:09.600
Ah! Ha ha!
Yeah, what are we gonna do?

13:09.600 --> 13:10.900
Whoa!

13:10.900 --> 13:13.000
Mmm. What's "custody day"?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.400
Mommy says it's today!

13:15.400 --> 13:17.300
Hey, guys, let's put your coats on.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.500
Custody day?

13:24.500 --> 13:26.300
Really? Alison?

13:26.300 --> 13:28.600
Custody day?

13:28.600 --> 13:30.700
This isn't all difficult enough?

13:30.700 --> 13:32.600
You have to give it labels?

13:32.600 --> 13:33.800
Bad negative labels?

13:33.800 --> 13:35.700
He must have heard me on the
phone with my mother.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.600
I didn't mean it like that.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.900
Custody day! Let's go, guys.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.300
Custody day!
Bye.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.500
- Bye, Mommy.
- Love ya. Love ya.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.300
- This is great.
- Custody day, custody day

13:49.500 --> 13:51.500
Am I being unreasonable?

13:51.500 --> 13:52.900
Do you think I'm being unreasonable?

13:52.900 --> 13:56.800
Not at all, but you have to acknowledge
That they are...

13:56.800 --> 13:58.400
Different than you and I.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.300
Men?

13:59.300 --> 14:02.200
Men are like boys with chesthair.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.900
Remember that and you'll never 
go wrong... 

14:03.900 --> 14:05.400
Or be disappointed.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.800
I just get so... mad.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.200
You know, part of me is like, 

14:09.200 --> 14:11.800
"Dude, you're dating Eddie Latekka.

14:11.800 --> 14:15.100
How lucky are you, except
all the wrong-doing.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.300
The other part of me...

14:16.300 --> 14:17.800
Can't do that.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.600
If only I could. Ugh!

14:21.600 --> 14:24.000
Ladies.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.600
I thought we'd barbeque.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.400
I got short ribs.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.800
Meadows, you in?

14:28.900 --> 14:30.100
Ray?

14:30.100 --> 14:33.500
If Hannah asked you to go visit 
her elderly grandparents
at the nursing home, 

14:33.500 --> 14:34.800
Would you?

14:36.900 --> 14:41.600
I feel li the correct answer
Could crucify Latekka, 

14:41.600 --> 14:44.700
So I'm gonna have to say, 

14:44.700 --> 14:46.800
Hell yeah!

14:46.800 --> 14:49.200
And I'd show up bearing gifts--

14:49.200 --> 14:54.900
Arthritis medicine, hearing aids, 
all 12 seasons of "Murder, She Wrote"

14:54.900 --> 14:59.300
I find it a little disconcerningthat you
"Murder, She Wrote" was on for.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.700
Jessica Fletcher rocked the casba.

15:01.700 --> 15:02.600
Where's Ace-man?

15:02.600 --> 15:03.900
He's in his room.

15:03.900 --> 15:05.300
I'm gonna say hi.
Okay.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.400
Would you indulge me one more "ugh"
toward all things Eddie?

15:09.400 --> 15:12.500
Absolutely. Go for it.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.200
Nick, Eddie, guess what I remember?

15:17.200 --> 15:18.600
What, Owen?

15:18.600 --> 15:21.100
You guys know what day it is today?

15:21.100 --> 15:22.100
Friday?

15:22.100 --> 15:24.400
Friday. May 25th.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.500
And that's significant... why?

15:26.500 --> 15:28.700
It's Angela's birthday today.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.100
And remember, she told us

15:30.100 --> 15:33.400
She's having a party
for all of her new friends.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.000
Then we know what we gotta do.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.700
What's that?

15:36.700 --> 15:40.700
We gotta get our butts
to the flats. Surprise her.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.900
Right, Nicky?

15:42.900 --> 15:44.200
Why not?

15:47.500 --> 15:49.500
Come on, guys!
This is gonna be cool.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.100
Did I just hear the doorbell
ring?

16:08.300 --> 16:10.100
No, Aubs was here.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.500
She, uh, 

16:11.500 --> 16:13.500
Brought a book over for me.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.000
A biography on Teddy Roosevelt.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.400
I told her you were here, 
um...

16:22.400 --> 16:24.500
And she didn't seem all that interested.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.600
Yeah, well...

16:26.600 --> 16:29.100
Everything okay there?

16:29.100 --> 16:32.400
It's fine. It's just...

16:32.400 --> 16:34.600
You ever feel like with the Dean

16:34.600 --> 16:37.800
Or Mom, like your head was gonna explode?

16:37.800 --> 16:40.000
Of course.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.600
It's combustable.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.700
Boys and girls together.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.500
You gotta take the good ka-booms
with the bad.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.800
The good ka-booms?

16:48.800 --> 16:54.100
The good ka-booms make
the bad ka-booms worth it.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.100
Yeah, I don't know much about much, 
kiddo, 

16:57.100 --> 16:58.500
But your Aubs--

16:58.500 --> 17:00.500
She's one of the good ka-booms.

17:05.201 --> 17:07.501
Hey you remember Angela Ferilli?

17:07.902 --> 17:10.702
Dad was a carpenter.

17:10.603 --> 17:12.803
They moved away when
we were little?

17:12.604 --> 17:16.503
Oh, I remember a Pete Ferilli carpenter.

17:18.005 --> 17:19.605
Don't remember Angela though.

17:19.669 --> 17:21.075
She was in my grade.

17:21.578 --> 17:23.037
What about her?

17:24.092 --> 17:25.571
Nothing. She...

17:27.858 --> 17:29.984
She was awesome, was all.

17:36.115 --> 17:38.460
I really don't mean to
disrespect your plan, Eddie, 

17:38.564 --> 17:40.298
But if the bus
doesn't get here soon, 

17:40.376 --> 17:43.544
<i>We may just make it in time
for Angela's sweet 16 party.</i>

17:43.646 --> 17:45.172
(Young Eddie)
Have a little faith, Philly.

17:46.695 --> 17:47.622
Have a little faith.

17:47.714 --> 17:50.323
Well, I brought lunch, 
just in case--

17:50.408 --> 17:53.374
Cream cheese
and pimento sandwiches.

17:53.462 --> 17:54.594
What's pimento?

17:54.695 --> 17:58.015
- Hey, what goes on, squares?
- Hey, did you break out again, 
Ikey?

17:58.106 --> 18:00.315
I heard we had
a birthday party to attend.

18:00.393 --> 18:01.998
We do, we do, we do!

18:04.287 --> 18:07.821
Here it comes!
All right.

18:10.517 --> 18:11.766
Why are you doing this?

18:11.880 --> 18:15.194
<i>Because it's a--
A thing.</i>

18:15.867 --> 18:17.179
Why is this a thing?

18:17.813 --> 18:20.143
How can you not ask
for pause-press?

18:20.797 --> 18:24.036
I just--I don't--
I don't understand how you can not ask
for pause-press.

18:24.124 --> 18:25.161
I was getting salsa.

18:25.239 --> 18:27.898
I understand that.
I don't take issue

18:27.981 --> 18:30.203
With the need to replenish
the all-important salsa bowl.

18:30.288 --> 18:32.106
But--But if you are gonna
replenish, 

18:32.181 --> 18:35.861
Just say, "Can you hit pause?"
Why is that a problem?

18:35.953 --> 18:37.379
<i>Why is this a problem?</i>

18:37.476 --> 18:39.644
You know "The Dirty Dozen"
is important to me.

18:39.742 --> 18:41.619
Because to you, 
I'm disrespecting not only you, 

18:41.689 --> 18:44.421
But Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, 
Clint Eastwood, 

18:44.493 --> 18:45.380
And all the rest of them?

18:45.929 --> 18:48.750
Clint Eastwood, of course, 
not being in the film.

18:49.820 --> 18:50.890
Who cares?

18:51.502 --> 18:53.877
Who cares?
It's just a movie, Phil.

18:54.941 --> 18:56.210
That's just it.

18:58.127 --> 19:01.641
<i>You don't get it.
Nothing is just a movie.</i>

19:01.735 --> 19:04.435
Are you kidding?
No! I am not.

19:05.016 --> 19:06.872
<i>I love that movie.</i>

19:07.004 --> 19:10.281
You know I love that movie, 
yet you blithely walk out

19:10.370 --> 19:14.916
For more salsa, which is, 
i think, not dissimilar to...

19:15.036 --> 19:17.729
To spitting my very own movie
back into my face!

19:17.818 --> 19:20.221
Okay, it's not your movie, 
dude.

19:22.410 --> 19:24.524
I need to feel like...

19:25.839 --> 19:27.720
When I share things
with you, 

19:28.358 --> 19:30.368
That you wanna share them
with me.

19:30.464 --> 19:31.392
<i>I do.</i>

19:32.486 --> 19:35.163
I mean, I really do.

19:36.294 --> 19:38.660
And I contend
with all of your...

19:39.757 --> 19:41.496
Idiosyncrasies.

19:41.575 --> 19:44.811
But just when I start to think
you're getting even remotely healthy, 

19:44.903 --> 19:48.386
You go and you lose it
over pause-press.

19:48.491 --> 19:49.632
You missed things.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.036
I didn't miss much.

19:53.963 --> 19:57.413
Just 12 military prisoners
on a suicide mission.

19:57.548 --> 19:58.947
They get dropped
behind enemy lines.

19:59.027 --> 20:02.448
They have to wipe out
a bunch of german dignitaries
at a french château.

20:03.507 --> 20:07.338
Franko, Posey... Maggott.

20:09.502 --> 20:13.772
I got it, Phil.
I so got it.

20:15.628 --> 20:17.557
My old friend died.

20:23.168 --> 20:24.962
And the funeral's
on Tuesday.

20:25.101 --> 20:26.700
I wanted to tell you that.

20:27.757 --> 20:28.982
I did.

20:29.089 --> 20:32.099
And then I was afraid
that if I did tell you, that you wouldn't...

20:33.827 --> 20:35.835
That I wouldn't what?

20:37.534 --> 20:39.865
That you wouldn't
pause-press.

20:59.152 --> 20:59.803
Hey.

20:59.913 --> 21:00.939
What can I get you?

21:02.051 --> 21:03.902
I just wanna talk.

21:04.046 --> 21:06.796
About what?
it's cool. I get it.

21:07.404 --> 21:09.052
I guess it just took a trip
to see my grams

21:09.140 --> 21:10.329
To put it in perspective.

21:10.419 --> 21:13.147
Nothing needs to get put
in perspective.

21:13.226 --> 21:15.408
It was--It was a disagreement.
That'll happen.

21:15.501 --> 21:17.328
It will. It's bound to.

21:17.480 --> 21:18.903
Sure.

21:20.973 --> 21:21.878
Okay.

21:22.551 --> 21:23.464
Yep.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.872
Except for one thing.

21:27.037 --> 21:30.030
Not okay.
Not okay at all.

21:30.155 --> 21:32.058
We've been hanging
for months.

21:32.209 --> 21:34.668
I've climbed
the Mount Everest of insecurity

21:34.768 --> 21:37.013
Just to get here, 
and no kidding, guy--

21:37.143 --> 21:38.422
It wasn't easy.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.143
So watching you squirm
over a 2-hour drive

21:41.241 --> 21:43.270
To see two people
who mean the world to me?

21:43.882 --> 21:46.939
Well, yeah, things do need
to be put into perspective.

21:47.555 --> 21:48.774
And they were.

21:48.928 --> 21:51.981
So either I can get you
something from my bar, or not.

21:52.532 --> 21:53.538
And if it's not, 

21:53.650 --> 21:56.790
Then I'd really apeciate you
just leaving me the hell alone.

22:08.342 --> 22:10.109
Aubrey?
It's me again.

22:10.726 --> 22:12.339
You ever gonna call me back?

22:12.980 --> 22:14.489
We should talk.

22:22.738 --> 22:23.552
Hey, Nick.

22:23.663 --> 22:26.221
Hey, what goes on, Sam?

22:26.324 --> 22:27.843
Me and mom
are running errands.

22:28.432 --> 22:29.750
I used to have errands.

22:30.329 --> 22:33.954
Sorry. He... Sam insisted
on coming in here.

22:34.637 --> 22:37.079
- We were just, uh, 
running some errands.
- I heard.

22:37.183 --> 22:39.975
- Nick used to have errands.
- Thank you, Sam.

22:42.258 --> 22:43.638
Hey, remember Angela Ferilli?

22:43.745 --> 22:46.796
Um... I don't think so.

22:46.883 --> 22:49.305
Ah, she might've moved away
before you got here.

22:49.426 --> 22:50.687
What about her?

22:51.330 --> 22:52.837
She died.

22:52.953 --> 22:55.431
Yeah, in a car crash
in Bishop Flats.

22:55.538 --> 22:57.155
Oh, my god.
That's terrible.

22:57.267 --> 22:58.513
I know. It's crazy.

22:58.616 --> 23:01.462
I mean, we haven't seen her
for, like, 18 years, but..

23:02.231 --> 23:03.818
Still...

23:05.084 --> 23:06.545
Are you going to the funeral?

23:07.697 --> 23:08.689
I wasn planning on it.

23:08.765 --> 23:09.681
You should go.

23:09.780 --> 23:12.637
- Really?
- Yeah, you should say good-bye.

23:12.758 --> 23:13.931
You should.

23:14.035 --> 23:15.834
Hey, Sam, 
when we were your age, 

23:16.554 --> 23:17.935
My friends and I--

23:18.468 --> 23:19.947
We would've followed
Angela Ferilli

23:20.044 --> 23:22.031
To the very ends
of the earth.

23:22.199 --> 23:25.981
<i>Hey you're locked into
WRXK rocks.</i>

23:26.093 --> 23:27.879
<i>These dudes are totally ill.</i>

23:27.977 --> 23:30.720
<i>Here's Cinderella
with "Coming Home."</i>

23:32.770 --> 23:35.110
<i>* I took a walk down a road *</i>

23:35.217 --> 23:40.511
<i>* it's the road
i was meant to stay *</i>

23:41.071 --> 23:43.580
<i>* I see the fire
in your eyes *</i>

23:43.669 --> 23:48.226
<i>* but a man's gotta
make his way *</i>

23:49.282 --> 23:53.615
<i>* so are you tough enough
for my love? *</i>

23:53.736 --> 23:57.250
<i>* just close your eyes
to the heaven above *</i>

23:57.353 --> 24:01.162
<i>* I'm coming home *</i>

24:01.271 --> 24:05.622
<i>* I'm coming home * </i>

24:10.374 --> 24:12.466
<i>* I took a ride in a world *</i>

24:12.575 --> 24:16.293
<i>* I'll be spinnin'
for the rest of my life *</i>

24:18.335 --> 24:20.615
<i>* I feel
your heart beatin', baby *</i>

24:20.724 --> 24:24.787
<i>* ooh, sometimes it cuts
like a knife *</i>

24:26.497 --> 24:30.375
<i>* so are you tough enough
for my love? *</i>

24:30.501 --> 24:34.006
<i>* just close your eyes
to the heaven above *</i>

24:34.113 --> 24:37.827
<i>* I'm coming home *</i>

24:37.929 --> 24:41.940
<i>* I'm coming home *</i>

24:42.111 --> 24:46.295
<i>* I'm coming home
where your love tonight *</i>

24:46.416 --> 24:49.896
<i>* can shine on me *</i>

24:50.476 --> 24:52.183
<i>* I'm coming home*
- Dorks.</i>

24:52.276 --> 24:58.512
<i>* where your loving arms
can set me free *</i>

25:06.999 --> 25:09.472
* ooh-Hoo-Hoo *

25:09.575 --> 25:12.243
- Talk to Pizza Girl?
- Nah.

25:12.879 --> 25:13.964
Talk to Janet?

25:14.076 --> 25:16.686
Yep.
I went over to Sully's.

25:16.806 --> 25:17.953
How'd it go?

25:18.590 --> 25:20.895
You ever hear the expression, 
"hell hath no fury like a girl

25:21.012 --> 25:23.731
Denied a visit to
her 80-year-old grandparents"?

25:23.875 --> 25:25.500
Why do they get so mad?

25:26.156 --> 25:29.783
Furious, frenzied, 
freaked-out mad?

25:30.420 --> 25:34.371
Your basic male--
His default emotion? Happy.

25:35.058 --> 25:38.070
Give him a meatball sub, 
a cold beer, nine innings

25:38.163 --> 25:40.906
And any Bruce Willis film
where Bruce gets to fire a gun, 

25:40.998 --> 25:43.436
And your basic male
is happy.

25:43.554 --> 25:45.325
Euphoric, even.
Yeah.

25:45.400 --> 25:46.463
But the female?

25:46.531 --> 25:50.963
Oh! The female has to have
everything just so.

25:51.062 --> 25:54.056
You know, whatever idea they
wake up in the morning with, 

25:54.124 --> 25:55.741
In their head, if that idea, 

25:55.820 --> 25:57.363
Notion, goal, 

25:57.466 --> 26:00.465
Is not summarily achieved, 
then say hello to bedlam

26:00.561 --> 26:03.411
Wrapped in mayhem, 
with a side order of chaos.

26:03.501 --> 26:04.873
I hear you, Chief.

26:07.293 --> 26:09.454
(Sighs) oh, man, 
Sundays are long.

26:09.566 --> 26:12.621
They are. They sure are.

26:15.217 --> 26:16.867
What do you got there?

26:19.217 --> 26:20.392
I found it this morning

26:20.504 --> 26:22.783
I was going
through all my old stuff.

26:33.736 --> 26:36.048
Main street.
Watch your step, boys.

26:36.837 --> 26:38.662
Ugh! I'm starving.

26:38.755 --> 26:40.558
Even pimento starving?

26:40.638 --> 26:43.036
Can someone please tell me
what pimentos are?

26:43.129 --> 26:45.669
It's a kind of pepper, 
often found stuffed in olives.

26:45.745 --> 26:48.563
Oh! I know those.
Um, olive red balls?

26:49.210 --> 26:51.098
Yes, Owen, olive red balls...

26:51.183 --> 26:53.752
Or as they're sometimes known, 
pimentos.

26:53.852 --> 26:55.762
Ah, whatever. I gotta eat.

26:56.433 --> 26:57.899
Don't rummage
in my bag, man.

26:58.019 --> 26:59.631
Come on, dude.
Uhh!

27:00.376 --> 27:04.345
Hey, come on guys. Come on.
Don't physical with Phil.

27:04.468 --> 27:05.358
What'd you say?

27:05.468 --> 27:06.899
I said, 
don't get physical.

27:06.983 --> 27:09.593
With Phil--"Physical Phil."

27:09.717 --> 27:11.505
From now on, 
you're "Physical Phil."

27:11.628 --> 27:14.103
<i>Nickname. Nickname.
Nickname.</i>

27:14.235 --> 27:15.440
Like that'll ever stick.

27:16.111 --> 27:17.136
Hey, what's this?

27:17.282 --> 27:19.417
Gimme that.
What is it?

27:19.577 --> 27:21.524
Nothing.
What is it, Physical Phil?

27:22.198 --> 27:25.373
- It's a present, isn't it? For Angela?
- It is?

27:26.518 --> 27:27.629
It is.

27:27.783 --> 27:29.427
Oh, what did we get her?

27:32.261 --> 27:34.361
<i>Nice, Phil.</i>

27:34.509 --> 27:37.273
(Both) "i Remember You."

27:37.976 --> 27:40.430
It's the Skid Row song--
Angela's favorite.

27:40.534 --> 27:42.696
She'll love it.
She'll be so happy!

27:43.330 --> 27:48.078
She'll turn into a butterfly, 
a bat or a bulldog.

27:48.800 --> 27:52.594
Let's go, guys, 
we're almost there.
* home *

27:53.179 --> 27:57.905
<i>* I'm coming home *</i>

28:21.403 --> 28:22.192
Hi, Nicky.

28:22.344 --> 28:23.303
Hey Dad.

28:28.282 --> 28:29.548
What you got there?

28:29.657 --> 28:31.621
Oh, I found, um...

28:31.733 --> 28:34.822
I found these old stories
I wrote in elementary school.

28:34.982 --> 28:36.751
Ma saved 'em all.

28:36.886 --> 28:39.630
Oh.
Works of a budding genius.

28:39.733 --> 28:42.603
Yeah, well, 
I don't know about that, but...

28:42.732 --> 28:45.658
This one--
It's about Angela Ferilli.

28:45.967 --> 28:47.643
Oh, the carpenter's kid?

28:47.799 --> 28:50.530
Yeah, but in this story, 
she's not a carpenter's kid.

28:50.643 --> 28:53.443
She's... kind of a magician.

28:54.629 --> 28:56.716
"Angela could change
into anything she wanted--

28:56.823 --> 29:00.047
"A butterfly, a bat
or even a bulldog." 

29:00.188 --> 29:01.981
"Depending on her mood, 

29:02.620 --> 29:06.392
"Which was really happy
or really sad.

29:06.565 --> 29:10.108
"But whether happy or sad, 
she was always pretty--

29:10.788 --> 29:14.503
"Pretty like a daffodil, 
which she could not change into, 

29:14.624 --> 29:18.235
"No matter how hard she tried, 
but she didn't need to, 

29:18.328 --> 29:22.680
"Because daffodils
were only one color--

29:22.815 --> 29:24.509
Golden yellow."

29:27.518 --> 29:30.022
"And Angela was all the colors
of the garden."

29:33.486 --> 29:34.215
Hey...

29:34.947 --> 29:35.481
Hmm?

29:35.584 --> 29:38.598
It sounds like you were
in love with this Angela.

29:39.290 --> 29:41.197
I think
I forgot about that.

29:41.320 --> 29:42.415
Forgot what?

29:43.945 --> 29:46.059
That we were all
in love with her.

29:59.188 --> 30:01.495
Okay, so I'll be back
in about an hour.

30:01.617 --> 30:04.031
Patty Walsh's labrador
got skunked.

30:04.144 --> 30:06.670
Oh, goodie.
Love it when you come home

30:06.753 --> 30:10.298
Smelling like hydrogen peroxide
and baking soda. Mmm.

30:13.188 --> 30:14.929
Are you reading
the obituaries?

30:15.538 --> 30:16.602
I am.

30:16.725 --> 30:19.439
And do you always?
I do.

30:20.044 --> 30:21.912
I like to see all the folks
I'm doing better than.

30:22.036 --> 30:23.781
You are deranged.

30:25.410 --> 30:28.906
Oh, is there anything in there
about Angela Ferilli?

30:29.058 --> 30:31.102
It was in yesterday's paper, 
actually.

30:31.220 --> 30:34.112
Pretty sad.
Did you know Angela?

30:34.242 --> 30:36.269
No, they moved
right before I got here.

30:36.386 --> 30:38.630
Yeah, she hung out
with the monkey squad--

30:38.740 --> 30:41.362
- Nick, Latekka and the others.
- Yeah, I know.

30:44.191 --> 30:45.778
What was she like?

30:47.695 --> 30:49.891
Well, she was 10
when I knew her, so...

30:50.048 --> 30:51.584
Right.

30:54.154 --> 30:55.918
She was all right.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.373
I mean, she had this strength
about her.

30:59.084 --> 31:03.494
Even at 10, you knew you were
in the presence of a badass.

31:04.789 --> 31:06.581
Kinda like you, 
Hannah Jane...

31:06.688 --> 31:08.204
If you rocked a slingshot.

31:09.482 --> 31:11.434
Long story.

31:12.460 --> 31:13.366
I'll see you later.

31:13.446 --> 31:15.026
Okay bye.

31:23.140 --> 31:25.827
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

31:25.961 --> 31:28.636
I know.
All of these kids look rich.

31:28.746 --> 31:30.642
Is the Flats a rich town?

31:31.718 --> 31:33.807
* Angela *

31:35.169 --> 31:38.533
I can't believe
you guys are here!

31:40.782 --> 31:42.752
This is crazy!

31:42.885 --> 31:44.473
I told you
we wouldn't miss it.

31:44.603 --> 31:47.489
No need for bats or butterflies!

31:48.086 --> 31:50.472
This is crazy.
Come on.
You guys want a dog?

31:51.146 --> 31:53.489
- Angie, when are you gonna
open presents?
- Soon.

31:53.586 --> 31:55.363
- Oh, guys, 
this is Grizzly.
- Hi.

31:55.456 --> 31:57.061
These are my homies
from the Ridge.

31:57.147 --> 32:02.639
This is Nick, Ikey, 
Owen, Phil and Eddie.

32:02.765 --> 32:05.381
Guys, this is Grizzly, 
my boyfriend.

32:06.676 --> 32:11.919
Whoa.
* Angela *

32:12.015 --> 32:13.546
So you guys want
some hot dogs?

32:13.649 --> 32:15.005
My dad's
the grillmaster general.

32:15.089 --> 32:17.446
Sure. We're starving.

32:17.544 --> 32:19.102
Come on then!

32:22.343 --> 32:24.062
Come on, guys.

32:24.218 --> 32:25.343
Hot dogs.

32:33.544 --> 32:36.296
These people are mostly nice, 
and Grizzly's cool.

32:36.394 --> 32:38.181
- Grizzly's a square.
- Yeah.

32:38.207 --> 32:39.913
Why do they even call him
Grizzly?

32:40.040 --> 32:43.671
I mean, he's not big.
He's not hairy.

32:43.778 --> 32:45.868
He certainly doesn't hibernate.

32:47.031 --> 32:48.634
You guys wanna head home?

32:49.324 --> 32:49.719
Yeah.

32:49.816 --> 32:53.086
What? Now? They haven't even
sang "Happy Birthday" yet.

32:53.823 --> 32:56.461
I gotta get
ck
to my cell before lights out.

32:56.605 --> 32:58.913
Uh, are we gonna say good-bye
to Angela?

33:00.106 --> 33:02.449
Come on, Owen. Let's go.

33:08.591 --> 33:11.938
Later, skater, waiter, 
and smelly cheese grater.

33:28.094 --> 33:31.886
<i>* we were so close together *</i>

33:34.038 --> 33:39.955
<i>* yeah, you felt like
a brother to me *</i>

33:41.241 --> 33:42.875
<i>* searching for</i>

33:42.987 --> 33:45.707
<i>* a little bit of truth</i>

33:47.139 --> 33:50.054

33:50.162 --> 33:52.789
<i>* inside of you</i>

33:54.424 --> 33:58.086
<i>* thought we could

34:00.879 --> 34:06.056
<i>* but there's more to life
than we'll ever know *</i>

34:07.707 --> 34:12.973
<i>* tell me why'd

34:13.170 --> 34:16.754
<i>* when i've got

<i>* to ask of you</i>

34:23.773 --> 34:29.552
<i>* will I see you in heaven? *

34:29.681 --> 34:35.313
<i>* shine your light from above *

and heavy hearts...</i>

34:35.902 --> 34:43.455
<i>* with your love

34:43.558 --> 34:46.498
<i>* won't you carry me?</i>

34:46.614 --> 34:49.902
<i>* won't you carry me home?</i>

34:50.005 --> 34:52.752
...whether it was
with Bishop Flats'

34:52.860 --> 34:56.995
Church charity drives
or the library at school, 

34:57.106 --> 35:00.704
She was always front and center.
She was an adventurer.

35:01.871 --> 35:06.120
<i>* well, faith is the answer *</i>

35:08.453 --> 35:13.432

35:50.072 --> 35:52.596
I was gonna
call you guys, but, uh...

35:55.421 --> 35:58.079
It's a sad day.
Yeah.

36:00.161 --> 36:02.686
Nick Garrett, 
old friend of Angela's.

36:02.815 --> 36:04.873
I'm really sorry
for your loss.

36:05.045 --> 36:06.290
This is Eddie.
Hi.

36:06.401 --> 36:07.567
- Owen.
- Hey.

36:07.688 --> 36:09.019
- Ikey.
- Hi.

36:09.674 --> 36:12.981
Rob Bear. Thank you.

36:13.273 --> 36:15.602
Thank you, Nick.

36:20.669 --> 36:23.313
This is something we meant
to give to your mom...

36:23.964 --> 36:25.479
A long time ago.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.073
Would you like to have it?

36:35.298 --> 36:39.484
<i>* well, faith is the answer *</i>

36:41.011 --> 36:44.810
<i>* can you spare some
to help guide me through? *</i>

36:44.923 --> 36:48.303
It says, 
"i remember you."

<i>* swim across the ocean *</i>

36:51.463 --> 36:53.138

37:22.915 --> 37:23.775
Who?

37:23.874 --> 37:25.382
Grizzly.

37:26.358 --> 37:27.898
She married Grizzly.

37:28.037 --> 37:30.235
What?
Rob Bear.

37:30.356 --> 37:32.896
Rob Bear. "Grizzly" bear.

37:33.022 --> 37:34.986
Remember we couldn't figure out
why they called him "Grizzly"?

37:35.097 --> 37:36.836
Because he wasn't big.
He wasn't hairy.

37:36.952 --> 37:38.980
Well, he certainly didn't
hibernate.

37:39.780 --> 37:43.285
Wow.
He was her meant-to-be.

37:43.441 --> 37:45.193
Yeah.

37:45.922 --> 37:47.387
We never stood a chance.

37:48.058 --> 37:49.724
Maybe if you think about it, 

37:49.872 --> 37:53.184
Ybe we've been searching for
Angela Ferilli our whole lives.

37:53.978 --> 37:55.165
You think?

37:56.856 --> 37:58.605
I know I have.

37:58.845 --> 38:00.886
Well, if you think
about it some more, 

38:01.043 --> 38:03.497
Maybe you guys have
already found her

38:03.629 --> 38:05.736
In what you got waiting
for you back in the Ridge.

38:17.088 --> 38:19.270
(Phil) I have something
I wanna share with you.

38:19.923 --> 38:21.070
Is that okay?

38:21.738 --> 38:23.083
Yes.

38:24.669 --> 38:26.215
It's a song...

38:27.842 --> 38:29.643
From a long time ago.

38:32.334 --> 38:33.925
And I hope you like it.

38:35.180 --> 38:37.213
But even if you don't, 
I'm...

38:37.821 --> 38:40.312
I'm just glad you're here
to listen to it.

38:43.443 --> 38:49.388
<i>(Skid Row - "I Remember You)"</i>

38:55.095 --> 39:00.188
<i>* woke up to the sound
of pouring rain *</i>

39:00.359 --> 39:05.551
<i>* the wind would whisper, 
and I'd think of you *</i>

39:05.685 --> 39:07.654
<i>* and all the tears you cry *</i>

39:07.771 --> 39:10.371
<i>* they call my name *</i>

39:21.879 --> 39:27.262
<i>* when love went blind, 
and you would make me see *
- I love it.</i>

39:27.379 --> 39:29.175
<i>* i'd stare a lifetime *</i>

39:29.274 --> 39:32.275
<i>* into your eyes
and I love you.</i>

39:32.422 --> 39:37.428
<i>* so that I knew
that you were there for me *</i>

39:37.977 --> 39:39.356
<i>* time after time *</i>

39:39.436 --> 39:43.431
<i>* you were there for me *</i>

39:43.543 --> 39:46.060
<i>* remember yesterday *</i>

39:46.747 --> 39:47.944
I was wondering if...

39:48.037 --> 39:51.596
We could... just sit?

39:51.756 --> 39:53.655
Of course we can, Owen.

39:53.766 --> 39:54.557
Of course we can.

39:54.665 --> 39:56.579
* through the sleepless nights *

39:57.671 --> 39:58.352
Pack a bag.

39:58.455 --> 40:01.663
What for?
We're going to Rhode Island.

40:01.801 --> 40:05.843
I got tickets to
"Bye Bye Birdie" in Providence.

40:05.977 --> 40:08.609
I figured me and Gramps
can get some nap time in.

40:13.228 --> 40:14.739
I can't write anymore.

40:14.868 --> 40:19.274
I don't know why.
I just... can't.

40:21.987 --> 40:23.509
And it scares
the hell out of me.

40:23.604 --> 40:26.440
<i>* ...would be like this *</i>

40:26.570 --> 40:28.982
<i>* you said, "i love you, babe" *</i>

40:29.106 --> 40:31.502
<i>* without a sound *</i>

40:32.188 --> 40:34.120
<i>* but I said i'd give my life *</i>

40:34.223 --> 40:37.239
<i>* for just one kiss *</i>

40:37.363 --> 40:39.474
<i>* i'd live for your smile *</i>

40:39.557 --> 40:43.181
<i>* and die for your kiss *</i>

40:43.265 --> 40:45.562
<i>* remember yesterday *</i>

40:46.350 --> 40:48.442
<i>* walking hand in hand *</i>

40:48.529 --> 40:50.757
<i>* i'd wanna hear you say *</i>

40:50.887 --> 40:54.289
* I remember... *
- Wait up, Angela!

40:59.570 --> 41:04.935
<i>* woke up to the sound
of pouring rain *</i>

41:05.042 --> 41:09.706
<i>* the wind would whisper, 
and i'd think of you *</i>

41:09.837 --> 41:11.576
(Boy) Angela! (Laughs)
