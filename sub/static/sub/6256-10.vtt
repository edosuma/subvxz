BRAY: <i>Come on, Miss Brennan!</i>
<i>Cut a cub</i>

06:46.663 --> 06:48.896

Braga have any enemies here?

06:48.932 --> 06:50.398
Or was it someone who
followed her from Brazil?

06:50.433 --> 06:51.699
It's an on-going
investigation, Wendell.

06:51.735 --> 06:53.095
You know I can't
tell you anything.

06:53.103 --> 06:54.543
How about a picture?
My camera's been

06:54.571 --> 06:55.870
waiting to capture
a beauty all day.

06:55.905 --> 06:57.538
Huh?
Flattery won't work.

06:57.574 --> 06:59.941
It'll work on me, doll.
He's waiting for you.

06:59.976 --> 07:02.477
And he is not happy.

07:03.747 --> 07:05.480
Hi.

07:05.515 --> 07:07.382
BRENNAN: <i>Dad, you have</i>
<i>to let me explain.</i>

07:07.417 --> 07:09.951
I'm not your dad now,
Officer Brennan.

07:09.986 --> 07:11.419
I need your weapon.

07:11.454 --> 07:14.022
And I need your badge.
I had to do this on my own.

07:14.057 --> 07:15.757
No one believed that Booth was
even in Los Angeles so I...

07:15.792 --> 07:17.125
You disobeyed

07:17.160 --> 07:19.127
my direct orders.
I almost caught him, Dad.

07:19.162 --> 07:20.495
Chief.

07:20.530 --> 07:21.996
But you didn't.
He got away.

07:22.032 --> 07:23.631
Because you didn't have
the proper backup.

07:23.666 --> 07:24.699
You wouldn't give me any!

07:24.734 --> 07:26.000
Badge and gun.

07:26.036 --> 07:27.702
You know,

07:27.737 --> 07:28.903
I stuck my neck out for you.

07:28.938 --> 07:31.205
Because I'm a woman.
Yes.

07:31.241 --> 07:33.274
But I can't do that anymore.

07:35.578 --> 07:37.912
I could be a
great detective, Dad.

07:37.947 --> 07:38.947
You know that.

07:38.982 --> 07:40.314
You let a murderer escape.

07:40.350 --> 07:41.350
I don't think Booth

07:41.384 --> 07:42.784
killed Eva Braga.

07:42.819 --> 07:44.018
I've studied his M.O. and...

07:44.054 --> 07:46.454
It doesn't matter
what you think.

07:46.489 --> 07:48.056
This is not your case.

07:48.091 --> 07:50.224
Now, if you want to stay
with the department,

07:50.260 --> 07:53.261
there's a stenographer's desk
out there next to Angela.

07:53.296 --> 07:55.296
MAN:
Sorry I'm late, Chief.

07:55.331 --> 07:57.698
This is, uh,
Inspector Aldo Clemens

07:57.734 --> 07:59.434
from Interpol.

07:59.469 --> 08:02.070
He has the lead
on the Braga case.

08:02.105 --> 08:03.905
This is my daughter, Temperance.

08:03.940 --> 08:06.674
Well, she's quite easy
on the eyes, Chief.

08:06.709 --> 08:09.077
You won't have eyes
if you keep talking like that.

08:09.112 --> 08:11.979
Booth did not kill
that woman, Chief.

08:12.015 --> 08:13.481
I've been tracking him
for years, my dear.

08:13.516 --> 08:15.983
So I think I know him
better than you.

08:16.019 --> 08:17.452
And I will be there

08:17.487 --> 08:18.653
when they flip that switch

08:18.688 --> 08:20.555
and fry him
like a breakfast kipper.

08:20.590 --> 08:22.557
The remains
weren't even warm.

08:22.592 --> 08:24.125
The bones weren't displaying...
That'll be all.

08:24.160 --> 08:27.528
Let me examine
the scene, please!

08:27.564 --> 08:29.864
You're making a mistake, Dad.

08:29.899 --> 08:32.066
I'm a good detective.
I'll prove it to you.

08:32.102 --> 08:34.669
I'm sorry, honey,
but you're suspended.

08:38.107 --> 08:39.907
Don't you dare take
one of those desks.

08:39.943 --> 08:42.176
You show them you're
as good as any guy in here.

08:42.212 --> 08:44.645
And you do it
for all of us girls.

08:45.748 --> 08:47.315
BRAY:
Ditto.

09:02.298 --> 09:04.932
BRENNAN: It's not time
to celebrate yet, Booth.

09:06.302 --> 09:08.302
Please put that away.

09:08.338 --> 09:11.906
How can a man enjoy a martini
with a gun pointing at him?

09:11.941 --> 09:13.708
I'm in no mood to joke.
I'm not joking.

09:13.743 --> 09:15.443
I imagine they took your badge
and gun-- that's the only

09:15.478 --> 09:17.778
reason you're holding
a peashooter like that.

09:17.814 --> 09:19.881
I'm not here to talk about me.

09:19.916 --> 09:21.649
Well, I know you're not here
to arrest me because I never

09:21.684 --> 09:23.417
leave any evidence.
You didn't.

09:23.453 --> 09:25.720
But they're convinced
you killed Eva Braga.

09:25.755 --> 09:27.955
Yeah, I imagine
they are, and you?

09:27.991 --> 09:29.924
It's not your style.

09:29.959 --> 09:31.592
For you, style is everything.

09:31.628 --> 09:32.960
After jewels.

09:32.996 --> 09:34.495
But unfortunately
there weren't any.

09:34.531 --> 09:36.264
They were all gone.

09:36.299 --> 09:38.232
Someone got there before me.

09:38.268 --> 09:40.434
And they took care
of Miss Braga, too.

09:40.470 --> 09:42.537
Which is why I have
a proposition for you.

09:42.572 --> 09:43.671
Please, darling.

09:43.706 --> 09:46.073
You're gonna make me blush.

09:46.109 --> 09:48.910
They're going to find a way
to arrest you for the murder.

09:48.945 --> 09:50.811
They've even brought in
Inspector Clemens

09:50.847 --> 09:52.180
from Interpol.
Clemens?

09:52.215 --> 09:54.215
(laughs)
That Brit drip.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.484
Look, Booth, you know all the
other people in your profession.

09:56.519 --> 09:58.386
Who else was
after Braga's jewels?

09:58.421 --> 10:00.188
You want me to help you
find the real killer

10:00.223 --> 10:03.057
to prove that you
should be a detective.

10:03.092 --> 10:04.425
The way I see it,
it's the only way for you

10:04.460 --> 10:06.127
to prove
you're not a killer.

10:06.162 --> 10:08.162
Hmm.

10:08.198 --> 10:11.432
Do we have a deal?

10:11.467 --> 10:14.235
Why not?

10:15.371 --> 10:17.939
Let's drink to it.

10:28.053 --> 10:30.720
BRENNAN: Professor Hodgins
is a brilliant paleontologist.

10:30.756 --> 10:32.555
BOOTH: This is no time to play
with dinosaurs, darling.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.624
Let's skedaddle.
I'm not your darling.

10:34.659 --> 10:37.327
Professor Hodgins.

10:37.362 --> 10:39.295
Professor Hodgins.
Yes?

10:39.331 --> 10:42.232
Who are you and how did you get in here?
Well, we chose the door.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.901
I'm Temperance Brennan
with the LAPD.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.269
This is Seeley Booth.

10:46.304 --> 10:48.271
I'm sorry, but
I'm working today.

10:48.306 --> 10:51.174
On my T Rex and
my velociraptor.

10:51.209 --> 10:53.076
Beautiful creatures.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.577
71 million years old
from the...

10:54.613 --> 10:57.046
BRENNAN:
Cretaceous period, I know.

10:57.082 --> 10:59.015
From the dromaeosaurid
theropod family.

10:59.050 --> 11:01.017
The professor really can't be
disturbed while he is working.

11:01.052 --> 11:02.285
Wait, Mr. Edison.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.488
You are familiar
with the velociraptor?

11:05.524 --> 11:07.023
BOOTH: I'm sorry, but you wouldn't
happen to have any gin?

11:07.058 --> 11:09.225
A conversation like this
and a man needs a martini.

11:09.261 --> 11:10.326
I'm quite familiar.

11:10.362 --> 11:11.628
This looks like
V. mongoliensis

11:11.663 --> 11:12.996
from Mongolia.

11:13.031 --> 11:14.931
I am impressed.
BOOTH: Well, so am I.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.332
But I still need that drink.

11:16.368 --> 11:17.934
I've read your research,
and I think you might

11:17.969 --> 11:19.602
be able to help us
catch a murderer.

11:19.638 --> 11:20.870
That is absurd!

11:20.906 --> 11:22.605
The professor
is not a flatfoot.

11:22.641 --> 11:26.042
But I'm sure he'll be
interested in this.

11:27.746 --> 11:28.878
BOOTH: You stole that
from the murder scene.

11:28.914 --> 11:31.781
Yes.
You're full of surprises.

11:31.817 --> 11:34.184
Professor Hodgins has
made amazing discoveries

11:34.219 --> 11:36.219
studying bones to determine
how dinosaurs died--

11:36.254 --> 11:38.455
why shouldn't he
be able to find clues

11:38.490 --> 11:39.589
on Eva Braga's bones

11:39.624 --> 11:40.824
that could lead us
to the killer?

11:40.859 --> 11:41.958
(scoffing):
Please, darling.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.293
I warned you, Booth.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.561
HODGINS:
She's right.

11:44.596 --> 11:46.429
It should be
theoretically possible.

11:46.465 --> 11:48.131
Looking at these, there was
clearly some kind of explosion.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.532
It's similar
to the damage

11:49.568 --> 11:50.728
from the lightning
that struck

11:50.735 --> 11:52.702
our coelurosaurian
theropod.

11:52.737 --> 11:55.071
But the explosion would've
obscured any other evidence.

11:55.106 --> 11:56.739
What else do you think
we can find?

11:56.775 --> 11:58.141
BRENNAN:
Positive identification,

11:58.176 --> 12:00.677
cause of death, evidence
of a struggle, if any,

12:00.712 --> 12:03.346
and anything else that could
point us to a specific killer.

12:03.381 --> 12:05.014
BOOTH: While you're asking
them for the impossible,

12:05.050 --> 12:06.916
why don't you see if they can
send a man to the Moon?

12:06.952 --> 12:08.051
HODGINS:
The young lady's idea

12:08.086 --> 12:09.419
is brilliant, sir.

12:09.454 --> 12:10.653
We should be
able to connect

12:10.689 --> 12:12.822
our research
to your mystery.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.557
But not without more
of the victim's bones.

12:14.593 --> 12:16.259
That shouldn't be a problem.

12:16.294 --> 12:18.127
No?

12:18.163 --> 12:19.128
You're a thief, aren't you?

12:19.164 --> 12:20.897
Let's see how good you are.

12:21.933 --> 12:23.633
A challenge.

12:26.938 --> 12:29.105
Bodies are so much
bulkier than jewels.

12:29.140 --> 12:31.140
And yet you seemed
right at home.

12:31.176 --> 12:33.443
I guess once a thief,
always a thief.

12:33.478 --> 12:35.144
I'll take that
as a compliment.

12:35.180 --> 12:37.180
So, have you
thought of a plan

12:37.215 --> 12:38.281
when they discover
her remains are missing?

12:38.316 --> 12:39.582
They won't.

12:39.618 --> 12:41.217
The coroner needs
a fresh corpse.

12:41.253 --> 12:43.586
That's why Eva Braga's
bones were in storage.

12:43.622 --> 12:46.389
Do you seriously think a couple of dusty
eggheads can help us find the killer?

12:46.424 --> 12:48.658
I guess you could say that
science is a hobby of mine.

12:48.693 --> 12:50.560
I like to think
that it could

12:50.595 --> 12:51.928
be the key
to solving crimes.

12:51.963 --> 12:53.203
Don't you have faith
in science?

12:53.231 --> 12:55.164
Course I do, darling.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.833
Without science,
we wouldn't have television,

12:56.868 --> 12:58.535
and I'm definitely
getting one of those.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.203
I told you not to
call me darling.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.772
You're used to getting
your way, aren't you?

13:02.807 --> 13:04.908
I wanted to drive,
and that's not working out.

13:04.943 --> 13:06.342
Mm, so perhaps
you could change.

13:06.378 --> 13:08.311
I was thinking
the same about you.

13:09.748 --> 13:10.880
Let's get these remains

13:10.916 --> 13:13.483
over to the professor,
shall we?

13:16.721 --> 13:19.756
I think we're the only
two people who believe Brennan.

13:19.791 --> 13:21.257
That's good
enough for me.

13:21.293 --> 13:23.326
I'm on my lunch break,
so this can't take long.

13:23.361 --> 13:24.994
BRAY: Vaziri is
the best fence in town.

13:25.030 --> 13:27.397
If anyone knows who stole
those jewels, it'll be him.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.799
How come you're only
a cub reporter, big boy?

13:29.834 --> 13:32.936
Injustice, but maybe
we can change that.

13:32.971 --> 13:35.004
Little early in the day
for a martini,

13:35.040 --> 13:36.040
isn't it, Vaziri?

13:36.074 --> 13:37.707
It's almost noon.

13:37.742 --> 13:39.342
Hmm! He's got a point.

13:39.377 --> 13:41.411
Since you're
drinking my booze,

13:41.446 --> 13:42.745
it's only polite to
introduce yourselves.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.647
Wendell Bray,
from the <i> Herald.</i>

13:44.683 --> 13:46.749
Angela Montenegro,
from the LAPD.

13:46.785 --> 13:47.984
Sort of.

13:48.019 --> 13:49.539
Then perhaps another
drink is in order.

13:49.554 --> 13:51.187
Seeley Booth is in town.

13:51.222 --> 13:53.623
Yes, and mixed up in some
nasty business, I've heard.

13:53.658 --> 13:55.959
Framed for Eva Braga's
murder, we're thinking.

13:55.994 --> 13:58.728
And since you fence
jewels for a living...

13:58.763 --> 14:01.130
A bit louder, my dear,
and we can dance to it.

14:01.166 --> 14:02.665
BRAY: The only thing
in Braga's safe

14:02.701 --> 14:03.900
was her body-- no jewels.

14:03.935 --> 14:05.401
MONTENEGRO:
We thought

14:05.437 --> 14:06.930
you might know what
happened to them.

14:06.954 --> 14:08.305
I do.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.906
At least six pieces
of the collection.

14:09.941 --> 14:12.742
She sold them to me when
she arrived in L.A. from Rio,

14:12.777 --> 14:15.445
all legal and aboveboard.
That's a first for you.

14:16.381 --> 14:18.348
I like to try new things.

14:18.383 --> 14:19.882
BRAY:
If she was so rich,

14:19.918 --> 14:21.584
why would she sell her jewels?
A word

14:21.620 --> 14:23.780
of advice, young man--
never try to understand a woman.

14:23.788 --> 14:25.254
MONTENEGRO:
Watch your step,

14:25.290 --> 14:28.224
Vaziri, unless you
want to wear that drink.

14:28.259 --> 14:30.893
Seeley is one of the best
in the business.

14:30.929 --> 14:32.562
He'd never ruin his reputation

14:32.597 --> 14:34.230
by killing anyone,
especially a woman.

14:34.265 --> 14:37.266
Now, if you'd like to throw
a drink in my face for that,

14:37.302 --> 14:39.902
be my guest.

14:44.709 --> 14:47.276
Thanks, Angela.

14:47.312 --> 14:49.879
Angela is trying to lift
the carbons of the files

14:49.914 --> 14:51.080
that are coming in
from Interpol.

14:51.116 --> 14:52.682
She'll try to stop by
after work.

14:52.717 --> 14:55.184
I've never had the law on my
side; you know, it's refreshing.

14:55.220 --> 14:57.220
She and a reporter
from the <i> Herald</i> talked

14:57.255 --> 14:59.288
with Vaziri who said
the jewels weren't stolen.

14:59.289 --> 14:59.963
He bought them.

14:59.987 --> 15:01.358
Well, that puts a new
wrinkle in the pants.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.260
If the jewels weren't stolen,
why was Eva Braga killed?

15:04.295 --> 15:05.395
Jealous lover?

15:05.430 --> 15:06.729
Sore loser in a
pinochle game?

15:06.765 --> 15:07.997
A poorly made omelet?

15:08.033 --> 15:09.298
I'm serious.

15:09.334 --> 15:10.667
I am, too.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.835
There are many reasons
for murder, darling.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.570
Hey, when do I get to drive?

15:14.606 --> 15:15.805
Maybe when you stop
calling me "darling."

15:15.840 --> 15:18.274
Should be a lot nicer
to your partner, you know?

15:18.309 --> 15:19.942
We're not partners.

15:19.978 --> 15:21.577
People working together
toward a common goal,

15:21.613 --> 15:23.513
that's pretty much
the definition of a partner.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.468
So, let's head out over
toward Fountain and Vine.

15:25.483 --> 15:27.583
I have to go home
and wait for Angela.

15:27.619 --> 15:30.119
She's not coming over
till after work.

15:30.155 --> 15:32.789
Come on, do your partner
a solid, will you?

15:32.824 --> 15:34.924
(tires squealing)

15:38.863 --> 15:41.698
Miss Brennan's
theory is brilliant.

15:41.733 --> 15:44.133
If we look at these remains
as if they were dinosaurs,

15:44.169 --> 15:45.601
then we should be able
to determine

15:45.637 --> 15:46.969
what happened
to this poor woman.

15:47.005 --> 15:48.604
But all this tissue.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.206
A hundred million years has
a way of removing it for us.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.841
Ah, yes.

15:51.876 --> 15:54.677
Unfortunately, we don't have
that kind of time.

15:54.713 --> 15:57.380
Must be another way,
there must be...

15:57.415 --> 15:59.882
Beetles.

15:59.918 --> 16:00.918
Beetles?

16:00.919 --> 16:02.485
Dermestid beetles.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.087
They thrive
on carrion.

16:04.122 --> 16:05.254
Yes, here, look.

16:05.290 --> 16:06.322
"Decomposing flesh."

16:06.357 --> 16:08.324
That is brilliant,
Professor.

16:08.359 --> 16:10.059
They will devour
the flesh

16:10.095 --> 16:12.328
and leave us with perfectly
clean bones to examine.

16:12.363 --> 16:14.997
Yes, Mr. Edison,
and if we can determine

16:15.033 --> 16:18.301
that a stegosaurus was killed
by the tail of an allosaurus

16:18.336 --> 16:22.371
150 million years ago, then
we should be able to determine

16:22.407 --> 16:25.241
what happened to this poor woman
yesterday evening.

16:26.745 --> 16:28.478
Professor.

16:28.513 --> 16:31.180
The clavicle.

16:31.216 --> 16:35.184
This damage was not
caused by an explosion.

16:35.220 --> 16:37.520
Interesting.

16:37.555 --> 16:39.322
Yes.

16:39.357 --> 16:41.657
(playing blues music)

16:43.428 --> 16:45.895
Booth, why did you bring us down here?
For the music, of course.

16:45.930 --> 16:47.363
You like music,
don't you?

16:47.398 --> 16:48.931
I don't believe this.
(laughs)

16:48.967 --> 16:50.600
Sarge!

16:50.635 --> 16:52.435
Booth!

16:52.470 --> 16:54.437
And you've brought
an angel with you.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.739
Temperance Brennan,
this is Sarge.

16:56.775 --> 16:58.875
We're partners.
Temporarily.

16:58.910 --> 17:00.209
Oh, I don't think
it's temporary.

17:00.245 --> 17:02.445
You two are made
for each other.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.847
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
Uh, sorry,

17:04.883 --> 17:08.351
but ever since that mortar
round went off next to me, I...

17:08.386 --> 17:10.118
I can see things.

17:10.155 --> 17:11.753
Hey, PeeWee, what

17:11.790 --> 17:13.122
can we offer our guests?

17:13.157 --> 17:15.458
Beans?

17:15.492 --> 17:16.893
Thanks,
PeeWee.

17:16.928 --> 17:18.394
Booth, we
should go.

17:18.429 --> 17:20.596
Oh, can't refuse
their hospitality now, can we?

17:20.632 --> 17:23.499
Oh, I got a little something
for you, too, here, Sarge.

17:23.535 --> 17:25.635
Sorry it's late.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.404
Much obliged, Corporal.

17:28.439 --> 17:30.106
Booth, what did he do for you?

17:30.141 --> 17:31.707
More than I can say.
Well, I'd like you

17:31.743 --> 17:34.010
to say something.
I'm sure you would, but for now,

17:34.045 --> 17:36.245
eat your beans
and enjoy the music.

17:36.281 --> 17:38.414

17:46.157 --> 17:48.791

17:52.706 --> 17:55.240
HODGINS: <i>It is certainly easier</i>

17:55.275 --> 17:57.642
on new bones than

17:57.678 --> 18:00.412
Are you thinking about becoming
a detective now, Professor?

18:00.447 --> 18:01.913
Sherlock Hodgins.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.515
Has a nice
ring to it.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.817
What else have you
found, Watson?

18:05.852 --> 18:08.987
Traces of, uh,
diatomaceous earth,

18:09.022 --> 18:11.256
sodium carbonate
and nitroglycerin.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.691
Yes, from the dynamite,

18:12.726 --> 18:14.826
but that couldn't have
been cause of death.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.528
With all due
respect, Professor,

18:16.563 --> 18:19.431
the woman was locked in a safe
with a stick of the stuff.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.199
I don't think
she had time to suffocate.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.068
Nor do I. Look
at the parietal.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.203
The concave
fracturing juxtaposed

18:25.238 --> 18:27.238
with the outward bowing
caused by the explosion.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.641
Blunt force trauma,

18:29.676 --> 18:32.143
like the kind caused by the tail
of an ankylosaurus.

18:32.179 --> 18:35.880
Which could have caused enough
damage to the brain to kill her.

18:35.916 --> 18:38.850
She was killed <i> before</i> she
was put into the safe.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.652
But then, why blow her up?
To obscure evidence.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.354
But theoretically, we should be
able to find tiny particulates

18:43.390 --> 18:46.558
in the bone, which might tell
us the true cause of death.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.594
I find I am quite enjoying
this, Mr. Edison.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.400
BRENNAN:
<i>No one will ever suspect</i>

18:55.435 --> 18:57.202
you're hiding out at my place.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.803
The couch is very comfortable.

18:58.839 --> 19:01.973
Right. So, you never let
anyone in your bedroom before.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.075
Must be cold in there.

19:04.111 --> 19:06.478
Men have been slapped for less.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.812
And more.

19:07.848 --> 19:09.948
You still haven't
told me about Sarge.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.416
(doorbell rings)

19:11.451 --> 19:13.184
The bedroom now.
Oh, miss.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.719
Go!
(giggles): Oh!

19:17.023 --> 19:19.491
(sighs)

19:24.131 --> 19:26.231
Are you talking
to someone in here?

19:26.266 --> 19:27.632
No. Why?

19:27.667 --> 19:31.436
Oh. Well, this person
who isn't here,

19:31.471 --> 19:33.872
don't make him sleep
on the couch, doll.

19:33.907 --> 19:35.573
Do you have
the carbons?

19:35.609 --> 19:37.108
All the information
collected so far

19:37.144 --> 19:38.543
on Eva Braga.

19:38.578 --> 19:41.112
So, Eva was dating
an American in Brazil.

19:41.148 --> 19:44.783
Some broke playboy named
James Aubrey III.

19:44.818 --> 19:47.852
Aubrey lives here and
recently came back from Rio.

19:47.888 --> 19:51.356
Rumor was,
he stole one of her rings.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.625
I haven't told your father
or the limey yet.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.727
Thanks.
No problem.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.395
So,

19:57.430 --> 20:00.999
Booth is a dreamboat
I'd like to take a sail on.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.334
How about you?
He's a jewel thief.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.936
No one's perfect, doll.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.771
Where is he hiding?

20:06.807 --> 20:09.240
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:09.276 --> 20:13.344
Okay, so, I'll get you
anything else I find.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.747
Good-bye, Booth.

20:15.782 --> 20:18.716
Take good care of her,
or I'll kill you.

20:23.089 --> 20:24.656
Quick. Get dressed.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.125
Aubrey should be at the Velvet Fox.
You know Aubrey?

20:27.160 --> 20:28.769
Oh, I almost robbed him
once when he had money.

20:28.793 --> 20:30.362
Almost?

20:30.363 --> 20:32.630
Oh, some people deserve
to be robbed, and others don't,

20:32.666 --> 20:34.732
What did I tell
you, Booth?

20:34.768 --> 20:36.401
That I had to sleep on the
couch, but I'll get over it.

20:36.436 --> 20:39.304
Now change. Quick.
We have to get to the Velvet Fox

BOOTH:
Right.

22:14.267 --> 22:15.934
Well, we're gonna make an
exception this time, old sport.

22:15.969 --> 22:16.969
DAISY:
Yes, Jimmy.

22:16.970 --> 22:18.169
Don't mind me,

22:18.204 --> 22:19.570
as long as the
story's good enough.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.773
Eva Braga is dead-- murdered.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.041
Oh.

22:23.076 --> 22:25.810
Yes, this is going to be
a good story.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.312
Eva?
Well, that's dreadful.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.080
Positively dreadful.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.549
Eva was paying your tab
in South America, right?

22:31.584 --> 22:33.451
I don't know what you're
talking about, old sport.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.786
He means...

22:34.821 --> 22:37.789
you need to find women
like me to bankroll you.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.557
It don't make
no never mind to me.

22:39.592 --> 22:40.758
Jimmy's a hoot,

22:40.794 --> 22:42.694
and calling him
"boyfriend"

22:42.729 --> 22:44.462
annoys Daddy to no end.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.564
AUBREY: Okay, so the cupboard's
a bit bare, old sport,

22:46.599 --> 22:48.666
but dead or alive,
how would I get Evie's money?

22:48.702 --> 22:50.001
BRENNAN:
You didn't need her money.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.636
Just her jewels.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.137
And with her out of the way...

22:53.173 --> 22:54.839
AUBREY: I'd never
kill anyone, my dear.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.374
It's them that you
should talk to.

22:56.409 --> 22:58.609
They were on the boat
when Evie came over.

22:58.645 --> 23:01.379
You see, she got bored with me
in Rio, and then I heard

23:01.414 --> 23:02.814
that she took up
with the Cuban

23:02.849 --> 23:04.882
on the boat.
The singer's his wife.

23:04.918 --> 23:07.752
Can't imagine she was
too happy about that.

23:07.787 --> 23:10.221
The fuzz is here.
I figured you'd want to know.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.990
Right. Okay, let's dance.

23:12.025 --> 23:13.958
No, too dangerous.
I'll distract them

23:13.994 --> 23:16.314
so you can talk to the singer.
You owe me a dance, darling.

23:17.864 --> 23:21.199
If you say anything to the cops,
old sport, you're toast.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.739
DAISY:
Oh, Jimmy,

23:27.774 --> 23:29.173

24:14.154 --> 24:15.653
Answers?
What kind of answers?

24:15.688 --> 24:17.321
Like who killed Eva Braga,
'cause right now,

24:17.357 --> 24:18.856
it's looking like you.
Yeah, why would I

24:18.892 --> 24:20.625
kill Eva Braga?
Because she was on the boat

24:20.660 --> 24:22.326
having an affair
with your husband.

24:22.362 --> 24:24.729
What? She and Rodolfo?

24:24.764 --> 24:26.697
(speaking Spanish)

24:26.733 --> 24:29.100
You contemptible Cuban cad.
How could you sleep with her?

24:29.135 --> 24:30.701
Who?
Eva Braga.

24:30.737 --> 24:32.570
(speaking Spanish)

24:32.605 --> 24:34.338
(groans)
I hate you.

24:34.374 --> 24:36.240
(speaking Spanish)

24:36.276 --> 24:38.743
Seeley. The heat's
closing in.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.745
We got to boogie, man.
I'm still trying to get

24:40.780 --> 24:41.879
these chowderheads to talk.
No time.

24:41.915 --> 24:43.281
Your girlfriend's in the car.

24:43.316 --> 24:44.882
Come on. Come on.
All right.

24:44.918 --> 24:45.918
All right, all right.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.285
I'm going to kill you!

24:47.320 --> 24:48.719
(Rodolfo speaking Spanish)

24:48.755 --> 24:49.987
Come over here right now.

24:50.023 --> 24:51.489
You get over here.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.825
(speaking Spanish)

24:57.382 --> 24:59.516
I thought I was
an early bird.

24:59.551 --> 25:01.551
I guess I'm the one who wants
to catch the worm. Coffee?

25:01.587 --> 25:04.588
I think it's time you
answered some questions, Booth.

25:04.623 --> 25:06.656
No "thank you" for the coffee?

25:07.559 --> 25:08.792
Thank you.

25:08.827 --> 25:10.427
(sighs)

25:10.462 --> 25:12.295
Are you protecting Sarge?

25:12.331 --> 25:13.797
Is he who we're
looking for?

25:13.832 --> 25:15.332
(chuckling):
If you think Sarge

25:15.367 --> 25:18.201
is the one who killed Eva,
you are a very bad

25:18.237 --> 25:19.669
judge of character.
I'm suspicious.

25:19.705 --> 25:21.238
It's part of
the job description.

25:21.273 --> 25:23.106
You don't have a job anymore,
remember?

25:23.142 --> 25:25.375
But since you asked...

25:25.410 --> 25:27.878
out of uniform, Sarge
wouldn't hurt a fly.

25:27.913 --> 25:30.180
He's seen enough
killings; so have I.

25:30.215 --> 25:32.449
But you paid him.
I take care of him.

25:32.484 --> 25:34.484
Like he took care of me
at Omaha Beach.

25:36.955 --> 25:39.322
Are you having
second thoughts about me?

25:40.926 --> 25:42.893
Do you really care?

25:43.796 --> 25:45.629
I shouldn't.

25:46.565 --> 25:48.131
(phone ringing)

25:51.336 --> 25:53.103
Hello?

25:54.006 --> 25:55.672
Yes.

25:56.608 --> 25:58.208
Yes.

25:58.243 --> 25:59.876
Thanks, Angela.

25:59.912 --> 26:01.278
The inspector and
my father know

26:01.313 --> 26:02.913
I was with you at
the Fox last night.

26:02.948 --> 26:04.314
One of the officers
saw us leaving.

26:04.349 --> 26:05.949
They're sending a team out
to look for us.

26:05.984 --> 26:07.617
I hate to run
before I had my coffee.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.320
Well, then knock it back,
because we've got to scram.

26:14.827 --> 26:17.294
These are Eva Braga's clothes,
taken from her closet.

26:17.329 --> 26:20.197
Should help us to positively
identify this poor woman.

26:20.232 --> 26:22.365
Size-four shoe.
Impossible.

26:22.401 --> 26:25.502
Look at the calcaneus
and the phalanges.

26:28.340 --> 26:31.174
Eva Braga was too large
to fit into these shoes.

26:31.210 --> 26:32.442
Bring me the dress.

26:32.477 --> 26:34.037
The woman only wore
the latest fashions.

26:34.046 --> 26:35.445
If this is her dress,

26:35.480 --> 26:38.849
it should fall
to the middle of her tibia.

26:40.219 --> 26:42.185
Look at the length
of the femur.

26:42.221 --> 26:43.520
She's at least

26:43.555 --> 26:45.722
four inches too tall
for a dress like this.

26:45.757 --> 26:47.123
Eva Braga doesn't
seem to be able

26:47.159 --> 26:49.492
to fit into her own clothes.
Which means

26:49.528 --> 26:51.628
that this is probably
not Eva Braga.

26:57.035 --> 26:58.635
What do you mean,
it's not Eva Braga?

26:58.670 --> 27:00.136
That's what the
professor said.

27:00.172 --> 27:01.838
The woman in the safe was
five-eight-and-a-half.

27:01.874 --> 27:03.406
None of Eva Braga's
clothes fit her.

27:03.442 --> 27:05.108
Wait a second.
Aubrey was seeing Eva Braga

27:05.143 --> 27:06.576
when he was in Brazil.

27:06.612 --> 27:08.979
If I had a sketch
of the dead woman,

27:09.014 --> 27:10.413
maybe Aubrey
could I.D. her.

27:10.449 --> 27:12.082
She must have
some connection to Braga.

27:12.117 --> 27:13.683
Well, the professor can show

27:13.719 --> 27:15.719
what a dinosaur looked like
from the bones.

27:15.754 --> 27:17.053
Angela is an artist.

27:17.089 --> 27:18.355
Perhaps she and the professor

27:18.390 --> 27:19.856
can make a sketch

27:19.892 --> 27:21.491
using the victim's skull.

27:21.526 --> 27:23.260
We have to get to a phone.

27:23.295 --> 27:24.661
Now I know why you
got suspended.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.430
They're all jealous of you.

27:33.105 --> 27:35.372
Aubrey. Hey.

27:35.407 --> 27:37.007
Aubrey!

27:37.042 --> 27:38.241
Seeley, old sport.

27:38.277 --> 27:39.609
Where's your beautiful
police officer?

27:39.645 --> 27:41.011
Listen, I don't have much time.

27:41.046 --> 27:43.580
Pity. I was hoping
we could all get a drink.

27:43.615 --> 27:45.448
They're trying to frame me
for Eva Braga's murder.

27:45.484 --> 27:47.317
Well, that's a frightful inconvenience.
And it turns out

27:47.352 --> 27:49.119
that the dead woman's
not even Eva.

27:49.154 --> 27:50.954
The murder victim--
you recognize her?

27:50.989 --> 27:52.923
(chuckling):
Seriously, old sport?

27:52.958 --> 27:54.824
You don't know who this is?
I don't think

27:54.860 --> 27:56.593
I'd be asking
if I did, old sport.

27:56.628 --> 27:58.828
Okay, then. While not
the best rendering, this is...

27:58.864 --> 28:00.263
(squishing thud, Aubrey groans)

28:00.299 --> 28:02.299
Aubrey, are you okay?

28:05.671 --> 28:07.938
(screaming)

28:07.973 --> 28:10.907
(people screaming and shouting)

28:18.167 --> 28:19.833
BRENNAN:
Whoever killed that woman

28:19.868 --> 28:22.703
must have killed Aubrey
to keep him from talking.

28:22.738 --> 28:23.904
Makes sense.

28:23.939 --> 28:25.238
You need another scotch?

28:25.274 --> 28:27.374
A double.

28:28.744 --> 28:30.677
He ditched me.

28:32.247 --> 28:34.715
Why would Booth take off and ditch me?
He must have had

28:34.750 --> 28:36.683
his reasons, sugar.
Or he was looking out

28:36.719 --> 28:38.852
for his own skin
because the heat was closing in.

28:38.887 --> 28:39.986
Not Seeley.

28:40.022 --> 28:41.555
All any of us really
know about him

28:41.590 --> 28:42.856
is that he's a thief.

28:42.891 --> 28:44.825
That doesn't make me
feel any better.

28:46.362 --> 28:48.628
You know why
that man steals, sugar?

28:48.664 --> 28:51.264
For justice.

28:51.300 --> 28:53.066
To right the wrongs he's seen.

28:53.102 --> 28:54.735
Eva Braga was his last job.

28:54.770 --> 28:56.403
I don't understand.

28:56.438 --> 28:59.306
He saw horrible things
in that war.

28:59.341 --> 29:03.009
D-Day, liberating the camps,
all the friends he lost.

29:03.045 --> 29:06.413
There were people
who made money from that war.

29:06.448 --> 29:07.748
Lots of it.

29:07.783 --> 29:10.484
They'd sell to Hitler
as easy as our side.

29:10.519 --> 29:13.653
It didn't matter to them
as long as they made a profit.

29:13.689 --> 29:16.423
Seeley couldn't let that stand.

29:16.458 --> 29:17.624
So he stole from them?

29:17.659 --> 29:19.226
And gave the money
to his chums

29:19.261 --> 29:23.296
who were having a rough time
since they came home.

29:23.332 --> 29:27.367
He said it was his way
of making things right.

29:27.403 --> 29:29.536
You fell for Robin Hood, sugar.

29:29.571 --> 29:32.139
(chuckles)
I haven't fallen for him.

29:32.174 --> 29:33.573
Then I stand corrected.

29:33.609 --> 29:35.409
But I don't believe you.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.947
Phone call for you,
Miss Brennan.

29:49.124 --> 29:50.524
This is Brennan.

29:50.559 --> 29:52.125
I have discovered
cause of death.

29:52.161 --> 29:54.728
There was still blood in the
fracture on the parietal.

29:54.763 --> 29:56.096
That's a bone
in the head.

29:56.131 --> 29:58.432
Also slivers of
polished wood.

29:58.467 --> 30:00.967
I believe she was pushed
down a flight of stairs.

30:01.003 --> 30:02.436
And the explosion?

30:02.471 --> 30:04.838
The decay of the nitroglycerin
in the trabecular

30:04.873 --> 30:07.207
tells me that the
explosion took place

30:07.242 --> 30:09.643
three hours before the
remains were discovered.

30:09.678 --> 30:11.044
Thank you, Professor.

30:11.079 --> 30:13.380
No. I should be
thanking you.

30:13.415 --> 30:15.749
You have opened up
an entire new branch

30:15.784 --> 30:17.451
of forensic science,
young lady.

30:17.486 --> 30:19.252
I'll talk to you soon.

30:20.189 --> 30:21.288
Good news?

30:21.323 --> 30:22.956
Booth couldn't
have killed her.

30:22.991 --> 30:25.058
He was nowhere near the
house at time of death.

30:25.093 --> 30:26.193
SINGER:
Hey! Hey!

30:26.228 --> 30:27.794
Booth!

30:27.830 --> 30:30.130
Hi. Sorry I left you back
there. Lately, people have

30:30.165 --> 30:32.532
a tendency to die around me.
Let me go, you brute.

30:32.568 --> 30:33.733
BOOTH:
Look at this.

30:33.769 --> 30:34.968
You recognize her?

30:35.003 --> 30:36.470
I don't know.

30:36.505 --> 30:39.673
(speaking Spanish)

30:39.708 --> 30:41.107
You know you're always
too late, don't you?

30:41.143 --> 30:42.209
Yes. I will work on that.

30:42.244 --> 30:43.343
Who is this?

30:43.378 --> 30:44.444
She might have been
with Eva Braga.

30:44.480 --> 30:45.812
I don't know.
The woman

30:45.848 --> 30:47.314
you said you were
fooling around with

30:47.349 --> 30:48.715
on the boat, who
said she was

30:48.750 --> 30:50.484
Eva Braga-- what'd
she look like?

30:50.519 --> 30:52.652
This is awkward, señor.

30:52.688 --> 30:54.454
Answer, Fuentes.

30:54.490 --> 30:57.457
She was...

30:57.493 --> 30:59.092
I'm sorry,<i> mi amorcita.</i>

30:59.127 --> 31:01.394
She was tall, dark, exotic,
with a sultry beaut...

31:01.430 --> 31:02.796
Ay!

31:02.831 --> 31:04.631
Pretty loose with those
adjectives, you louse.

31:04.666 --> 31:06.967
Goodness gracious, Booth,
this is Eva Braga.

31:07.002 --> 31:08.034
What?
The maid.

31:08.070 --> 31:09.769
It was the maid, Booth.

31:09.805 --> 31:11.338
The maid killed Eva Braga.

31:11.373 --> 31:13.507
What? The maid?
Come on!

31:13.542 --> 31:14.641
(speaking Spanish)

31:14.676 --> 31:16.176
BRENNAN:
<i>Aubrey was killed</i>

31:16.211 --> 31:18.345
<i>because he knew</i>
<i>the real Eva Braga.</i>

31:18.380 --> 31:20.180
Because he met her in
Rio, not on the boat.

31:20.215 --> 31:21.748
So it was the maid on the boat?

31:21.783 --> 31:23.083
Yes. And those
were her clothes

31:23.118 --> 31:24.417
they tried on Eva.

31:24.453 --> 31:25.952
That's why they
didn't fit.

31:25.988 --> 31:28.288
She stole Eva's
jewels, took off,

31:28.323 --> 31:29.823
posing as Eva
on the boat.

31:29.858 --> 31:31.925
So then the real Eva found out
her jewels were missing,

31:31.960 --> 31:34.094
figured out the maid took them
and came after her.

31:34.129 --> 31:36.162
The maid kills Eva
to protect her secret

31:36.198 --> 31:37.797
and frames you
because she knows

31:37.833 --> 31:39.566
you'll be coming
after her jewels.

31:39.601 --> 31:40.667
How would she know that?

31:40.702 --> 31:42.035
Because Eva Braga's family

31:42.070 --> 31:44.304
got rich during the war
selling arms

31:44.339 --> 31:46.139
to Hitler on
the black market.

31:46.174 --> 31:47.807
She knew you'd
never let that stand,

31:47.843 --> 31:50.076
not when you have Sarge
and PeeWee

31:50.112 --> 31:51.711
and the others to take care of.

31:51.747 --> 31:53.947
You seem to have me
all figured out.

31:53.982 --> 31:56.516
I'm a detective, remember?

31:58.287 --> 32:00.954
Got it. State Route 34.
See you in 15 minutes.

32:00.989 --> 32:03.723
(grunts)
My God.

32:03.759 --> 32:06.726
What are you doing here? You're
the man they're looking for.

32:06.762 --> 32:08.929
You get away from me. And you.
Save your breath, baby.

32:08.964 --> 32:10.363
We know
you killed Eva.

32:10.399 --> 32:11.998
Me? That's absurd.
And you killed Aubrey

32:12.034 --> 32:13.667
because he was going
to give you away.

32:13.702 --> 32:14.935
That's why you're leaving.

32:14.970 --> 32:16.937
No, I'm leaving
because I no longer

32:16.972 --> 32:19.573
have an
employer.

32:22.477 --> 32:23.910
What are you doing?

32:23.946 --> 32:25.512
BRENNAN: The light refracted
off this crystal

32:25.547 --> 32:27.213
will create a prism
which will show

32:27.249 --> 32:30.550
if there are blood traces
anywhere.

32:30.586 --> 32:32.719
Like there on the banister.

32:32.754 --> 32:35.021
A real maid would've cleaned
better, Camille.

32:35.057 --> 32:36.289
You're brilliant.
Of course I am.

32:36.325 --> 32:38.224
Why is everyone
always surprised by that?

32:38.260 --> 32:39.392
You are under
arrest for the...

32:39.428 --> 32:41.161
Both of you. In the closet.

32:41.196 --> 32:43.396
Put the gun on the
floor and slide it

32:43.432 --> 32:45.231
over here, or I'll kill him.

32:45.267 --> 32:47.133
BOOTH:
Don't do it.

32:47.169 --> 32:49.169
I've taken plenty
of bullets in my day.

32:59.181 --> 33:01.481
Move it.

33:10.192 --> 33:13.526
Open the closet
and get in.

33:13.562 --> 33:14.928
Go.

33:27.876 --> 33:29.776
Well...

33:29.811 --> 33:32.345
We should probably
try to escape.

33:32.381 --> 33:34.280
Yes, I imagine
we should.

33:35.784 --> 33:37.517
You, come with me.
What? No.

33:37.552 --> 33:38.818
You can't...
Yeah, I can, chump,

33:38.854 --> 33:40.353

calling the shots here.

33:40.389 --> 33:41.921
And if you ever want
to see your girl again,

33:41.957 --> 33:43.556

Sure. People talk when
they don't hate you.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.507

34:13.534 --> 34:14.766
Well, I don't believe you.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.469
Booth has to be the killer.

CLEMENS: You're just trying

34:18.672 --> 34:20.206

34:20.241 --> 34:22.475
His daughter is brilliant,
Jeeves.

34:22.510 --> 34:24.310
I wouldn't have been able
to give this beautiful artist

34:24.346 --> 34:25.945

34:25.981 --> 34:27.347

visionary help.

You really

34:29.150 --> 34:31.284
think I'm beautiful, Doc?

34:31.319 --> 34:32.851
The Golden Ratio

34:32.887 --> 34:35.755
is hard to argue with,
Miss Montenegro.

34:38.293 --> 34:39.726
As is the forensic fact

34:39.761 --> 34:42.661
that the murder occurred
three hours before

34:42.697 --> 34:44.429
Mr. Booth entered the house.
You actually believe all this?

34:44.466 --> 34:45.965
MAX:
Yes, I do.

34:46.001 --> 34:48.266
So, Inspector,
you're not needed here anymore.

34:48.303 --> 34:49.435
Are you serious?

34:49.471 --> 34:51.170
Very serious.

you bombastic twit.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.373

You will be hearing
