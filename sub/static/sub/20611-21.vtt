WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:04.372
- Here in the Forge,
the best bladesmiths

00:04.405 --> 00:06.240
in the world
have gone head-to-head,

00:06.274 --> 00:08.542
creating some of
history's deadliest weapons.

00:08.576 --> 00:11.712
A select few have
earned the title Champion.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.681
- Yes!

00:13.714 --> 00:16.050
- But tonight
in a "Forged in Fire" first,

00:16.084 --> 00:17.651
five of these iron warriors

00:17.685 --> 00:19.687
return for the
ultimate competition.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.523
You will have to earn
your spot at the anvil,

00:22.556 --> 00:24.092
and one of you
will be sent home

00:24.125 --> 00:26.160
before we ever light
the first forge.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.329
- I don't want to go home
without having the chance

00:28.362 --> 00:30.331
to swing a hammer.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.433
- Only one will emerge
as the best of the best,

00:32.466 --> 00:35.803
taking home $10,000
and leaving with the title

00:35.836 --> 00:38.272
Champion of Champions.

00:38.306 --> 00:45.179
*

00:45.213 --> 00:47.315
- My name's Neil Kamimura.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.383
I was asked to come back,
and I would never say no

00:49.417 --> 00:50.851
to my "Forged in Fire" family.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.853
What I feel I've come back for

00:52.886 --> 00:55.723
is to represent
the people just starting off

00:55.756 --> 00:57.758
and show them that
you can do this.

00:57.791 --> 01:01.195
The judges asked me to make
a competition chopper

01:01.229 --> 01:03.264
before I even got out here.

01:03.297 --> 01:06.400
I have no idea what they're
gonna do with it.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.469
- My name is Theo Nazz.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.371
Winning "Forged in Fire"
allowed me to turn my hobby

01:10.404 --> 01:13.641
into a full-time career
in knife making and teaching.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.377
The judges like to break
the rules and mix things up.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.746
So I really don't know
what I'm up against.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.282
- My name's
Kelly Vermeer Vella.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.850
I have no idea what they're
gonna do with my chopper.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.652
I've tried to guess.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.620
But I returned
to "Forged in Fire"

01:26.654 --> 01:29.157
just to prove to myself
that I'm not a one-hit wonder.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.625
*

01:31.659 --> 01:34.528
- My name's Raymond Smith,
and I'm back on "Forged in Fire"

01:34.562 --> 01:36.630
because last time I was here

01:36.664 --> 01:39.533
the other competitor
didn't meet the requirements,

01:39.567 --> 01:41.302
so it basically
was a default win.

01:41.335 --> 01:44.572
But after I won,
I was on a trip to California,

01:44.605 --> 01:46.407
and on the way back,

01:46.440 --> 01:47.475
a gentleman
I was sitting next to

01:47.508 --> 01:49.610
actually recognized me.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.712
And he was like, "I need your
autograph, and I need this."

01:51.745 --> 01:54.248
So I just give him
a business card, and here we go.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.484
- I am Nick Marcelja.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.352
Last time,
all three of my opponents

01:58.386 --> 02:00.721
had catastrophic failures
on their blades.

02:00.754 --> 02:04.892
So I'd like to prove
it wasn't really a fluke.

02:04.925 --> 02:08.629
After watching myself on TV,
I did find it interesting

02:08.662 --> 02:10.798
what you guys beep over
and what you don't.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.833
"I feel like crap."

02:12.866 --> 02:14.668
They let that go through,

02:14.702 --> 02:16.670
while, "I feel like [bleep]"
doesn't work.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.473
Get in there!

02:19.507 --> 02:22.510
- Champions,
Welcome back to the Forge.

02:22.543 --> 02:25.213
You're probably wondering
why there are five of you

02:25.246 --> 02:27.515
and there's only room
for four in this forge

02:27.548 --> 02:29.583
and why we asked you
to forge your best work

02:29.617 --> 02:31.219
in the form
of a competition chopper

02:31.252 --> 02:32.620
before you even got here.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.288
You're all champions.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.290
So this time,
we thought we'd do things

02:36.324 --> 02:38.959
a little bit differently
and raise the bar even higher.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.862
In a "Forged in Fire" first,
we're going to start

02:41.895 --> 02:44.865
with a test on these blades
you forged at home.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.468
You will have to earn
your spot at the anvil,

02:47.501 --> 02:49.503
and one of you
will be sent home

02:49.537 --> 02:52.673
before we ever light
the first forge.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.842
All right, let's meet the men
judging your work.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.910
Up first, two-time winner

02:56.944 --> 02:58.979
and our very first
Champion of Champions,

02:59.012 --> 03:00.881
Ben Abbott.

03:00.914 --> 03:03.251
- Holy crap.
Ben Abbott.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.818
He's the Champion of Champions,

03:04.852 --> 03:07.655
so how fitting
for him to be our judge.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.957
- Edged-weapons specialist
Doug Marcaida.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.993
Historic weapons re-creations
specialist David Baker.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.929
Since we like to throw people
right into the fire here,

03:15.963 --> 03:17.665
Ben, you're up.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.633
*

03:19.667 --> 03:21.435
- Hello, Champions.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.736
In this qualifying round,

03:22.770 --> 03:24.505
in order to test
the edge geometry

03:24.538 --> 03:26.607
and the overall construction
of your blade,

03:26.640 --> 03:30.278
I'm gonna chop into this log
ten times each.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.446
I'm glad it's you in there,
not me this time.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.515
Nick, you're up first.
Are you ready?

03:34.548 --> 03:36.784
- Oh, sure.
Let's do it.

03:36.817 --> 03:40.254
My blade is 80 layers of
ladder pattern Damascus

03:40.288 --> 03:42.423
with G10 handles.

03:42.456 --> 03:47.461
I tested my blade on 2x4s,
and it worked fine.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.297
But we'll see what happens.

03:49.330 --> 03:56.270
*

04:02.376 --> 04:04.478
*

04:04.512 --> 04:06.914
- Well, Nick,
your edge held up very well.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.783
I don't see any wiggles
in the blade.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.619
The handle has got
a nice feel to it.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.053
It didn't come out
of my hands.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.423
Good job.
- Thank you much.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.590
- Ray, you're next.
Are you ready?

04:16.624 --> 04:18.459
- I'm ready.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.795
I built my chopper
out of 5160 steel.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.030
I put an Osage handle
on it.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.632
I think it'll chop.

04:24.665 --> 04:31.639
*

04:42.583 --> 04:44.685
*

04:44.718 --> 04:47.455
- Well, Ray, your edge held up
very, very well,

04:47.488 --> 04:49.423
but didn't quite bite
into the wood

04:49.457 --> 04:51.692
as much as I would have liked
to have seen it do.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.894
I'm having a rough time
indexing this handle

04:53.927 --> 04:55.062
into my hand.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.864
It's kind of blocky.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.833
I did feel the knife
take a roll at one point

04:59.867 --> 05:03.637
because I just couldn't get
enough grip on the handle.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.639
- Kelly, you're up next.
Are you ready?

05:05.673 --> 05:07.841
- You bet.
- All right.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.577
- The competition chopper

05:09.610 --> 05:11.445
is 900-layer
laddered Damascus

05:11.479 --> 05:13.414
with a patriotic handle.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.716
It's freaking beautiful,
and I don't want it to die.

05:15.749 --> 05:22.723
*

05:28.629 --> 05:32.533
*

05:32.566 --> 05:34.568
- Kelly,
this is a beautiful knife.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.670
It chopped the wood very well.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.606
It's a purpose-built machine.

05:38.639 --> 05:41.975
I love the flag.
It's a nice touch...

05:42.009 --> 05:44.678
even though I'm English.
[both chuckle]

05:44.712 --> 05:46.380
Theo, you're up next.
Are you ready?

05:46.414 --> 05:47.881
- Let's do it.
- All right.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.718
- A forged 80CRV2

05:50.751 --> 05:52.753
with some 3D-printed
cast bronze medallions

05:52.786 --> 05:54.555
for a little extra grip
on the handle.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.524
I think I feel nervous.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.692
But I'm pretty sure
it's actually just eagerness

05:58.726 --> 06:00.694
and anticipation.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.030
I just want to see
how the chopper does.

06:03.063 --> 06:09.670
*

06:13.741 --> 06:17.110
*

06:17.144 --> 06:19.880
- Well, Theo, I was a little
nervous going into this

06:19.913 --> 06:23.417
at how thin of a blade this was,
but it held up perfectly.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.953
The handnd
is a little bit small,

06:25.986 --> 06:27.855
a little bit square.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.890
But it's a nice little chopper.
- Thank you.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.559
- Okay, Neil.
You're up next.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.527
Are you ready?
- Ready.

06:33.561 --> 06:36.930
I made mine
with 5160 spring, G10,

06:36.964 --> 06:39.099
and some locally grown
cocobolo.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.469
I think my competitors
are amazing,

06:41.502 --> 06:44.438
so I'm a little nervous...
you know.

06:46.039 --> 06:52.980
*

06:57.551 --> 07:00.621
*

07:00.654 --> 07:03.023
- Well, Neil,
your edge held up beautifully.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.726
It's still as sharp as
when it was made.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.762
Did quite a number
on the oak as well.

07:08.796 --> 07:11.499
Very comfortable handle.
Did very well.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.800
- Thank you.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.702
*

07:14.735 --> 07:16.136
- Being eliminated right away

07:16.169 --> 07:18.171
would really be
quite unfortunate.

07:18.205 --> 07:21.074
I don't want to go home
without even having the chance

07:21.108 --> 07:23.010
to swing a hammer.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.546
- Champions, first of all,
thank you all

07:25.579 --> 07:28.015
for bringing in blades
that were so well-made.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.918
It makes our decision
that much tougher.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.253
But unfortunately,
there's only room in this Forge

07:33.286 --> 07:35.122
for four of you.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.890
The decision has been made.

07:36.924 --> 07:40.027
It's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.195
*

07:42.229 --> 07:44.097
- Ray...

07:44.131 --> 07:47.167
unfortunately, your blade
did not make the cut.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.671
- Ray, I love the file work
on the back.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.873
It's a really handsome shape.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.075
But unfortunately, things have
to come down to small details.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.144
It just came down
to the fact

07:57.177 --> 07:59.279
that I had a really tough time
holding on to your handle,

07:59.312 --> 08:01.515
and I really couldn't transfer
as much force to the wood

08:01.549 --> 08:03.150
as I would have liked.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.152
- Ray, at this time,
I have to ask you

08:05.185 --> 08:07.588
to please leave the Forge.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.122
- One thing with making
something like this

08:09.156 --> 08:11.825
is it doesn't fit everybody.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.727
Sometimes that can
be the difference.

08:13.761 --> 08:15.763
But even though
I'm being sent home,

08:15.796 --> 08:17.831
I'm still a
"Forged in Fire" champion.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.299
Can't take that away.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.670
*

08:22.703 --> 08:24.071
- Good job, bladesmiths.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.939
You've earned a spot
at your anvils

08:25.973 --> 08:27.708
in the qualifying round.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.110
Now it's time to
get into the main event.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.680
Now, I'm sure you're all
looking at this drape

08:32.713 --> 08:34.948
with a little bit of anxiety.

08:34.982 --> 08:38.118
- This is Champion of Champions.
You can't count anything out.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.588
- Today we're not gonna be
providing you

08:40.621 --> 08:42.923
with just one steel or
two steels to work with.

08:42.956 --> 08:46.159
Instead, we're providing
you with this.

08:46.193 --> 08:50.664
*

08:50.698 --> 08:52.733
All of them.

08:52.766 --> 08:55.936
This is every type of steel
that we have in the Forge.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.838
Your first round challenge
is to use two or more

08:57.871 --> 09:00.273
of these materials
combined with powdered steel

09:00.307 --> 09:02.275
in a canister Damascus.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.745
The blade parameters
are as follows--

09:04.778 --> 09:06.980
The length of the blade,
not including the tang,

09:07.014 --> 09:09.650
must fall between
10 and 14 inches.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.084
The overall length
of your weapon

09:11.118 --> 09:13.253
must not exceed 22 inches.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.322
Now, one more thing--

09:15.355 --> 09:18.959
today we will not be
giving you any canisters

09:18.992 --> 09:21.161
that are of substantial size.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.330
Instead, you'll be
using these.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.698
*

09:24.732 --> 09:26.199
- Yay.
Baby cans.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.236
- This is
a 2-inch-by-2-inch can,

09:29.269 --> 09:31.204
and I imagine if you're
gonna make a blade

09:31.238 --> 09:33.240
that is between
10 and 14 inches,

09:33.273 --> 09:35.208
you're gonna need
more than one of these.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.812
- I've never done
a normal canister Damascus,

09:38.846 --> 09:41.214
let alone a teeny-tiny one.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.651
Great.
[laughs]

09:43.684 --> 09:45.185
- Bear in mind that
in the second round,

09:45.218 --> 09:47.020
you'll be attaching
handles to those blades

09:47.054 --> 09:49.089
to turn them into
fully functional weapons

09:49.122 --> 09:51.291
that will then be tested
for strength and durability

09:51.324 --> 09:53.727
in an ice chop,
and for sharpness

09:53.761 --> 09:55.729
in a water bottle slice.

09:55.763 --> 09:58.098
You will have three hours
to forge your blades

09:58.131 --> 10:00.267
with no design period.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.135
Good luck, bladesmiths.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.905
Your three hours starts now.

10:04.938 --> 10:08.375
All right, Ben, you've been
in this competition before.

10:08.408 --> 10:11.378
You've won it twice.
Got to defer to you.

10:11.411 --> 10:15.082
How did you do this challenge
easier and faster?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.850
- You got to do
time management.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.686
- Isn't the cube Damascus

10:18.719 --> 10:19.987
just basically half
a canister Damascus?

10:20.020 --> 10:21.321
- It is.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.657
- How much canisters
do you need?

10:23.691 --> 10:25.125
- Well, they can use as many
or as little cans as they like.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.761
But for a 10- to 14-inch blade,
I'd use two.

10:27.795 --> 10:30.230
- Well, it seems like all of our
smiths are using three cans,

10:30.263 --> 10:32.232
and Nick actually has four.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.134
- Three cans is quite
an aggressive number

10:34.167 --> 10:35.268
to be dealing with.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.437
- Ah.
[laughing]

10:37.470 --> 10:40.207
This challenge sucks.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.109
You want us to make
something difficult

10:42.142 --> 10:43.911
and then make it
even more difficult

10:43.944 --> 10:45.946
by making us use
little boxes.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.448
Thanks a lot.
Yeah.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.852
[groans] There we go.
There, they can bleep that out.

10:51.885 --> 10:55.155
I have done
canister Damascus before,

10:55.188 --> 10:57.324
so I paint it with the
Wite-Out on the inside.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.794
- What does the Liquid Paper
do for a smith?

11:00.828 --> 11:03.997
- The Liquid Paper keeps
the outside canister steel

11:04.031 --> 11:06.133
from welding to
the interior steel.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.268
- We've got a
Wite-Out explosion

11:08.301 --> 11:10.938
over on the table
where Nick is working.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.906
- I know it's got to be dry

11:12.940 --> 11:14.908
before I put
the materials inside.

11:14.942 --> 11:17.210
So I hold it in front
of the forge to dry it out.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.146
- Look at Nick. He's got his
Wite-Out on fire over there.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.414
- Oh, by the way,
Wite-Out burns.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.784
It turns into little candles.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.820
- The problem is, you can burn
off that Wite-Out

11:26.854 --> 11:29.389
Now you've got sections
that are gonna stick to the can

11:29.422 --> 11:31.191
and sections that aren't gonna
stick to the can.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.893
*

11:32.926 --> 11:35.095
- Let's talk about
this challenge.

11:35.128 --> 11:38.365
You have to use two of those
steels that were on the table,

11:38.398 --> 11:40.467
in addition to
the powdered steel.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.770
Which ones would you use, Ben?

11:42.803 --> 11:44.037
- You go with
the thing you know.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.739
They're all hardenable steel.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.340
The powder
is where it's most important,

11:47.374 --> 11:49.176
'cause you really want
to have powder

11:49.209 --> 11:51.444
as the very, very top,
because anything that isn't

11:51.478 --> 11:53.313
is gonna leave
a lot of gaps.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.415
- Having three hours
to do the challenge,

11:55.448 --> 11:57.284
I don't feel like I can
do the Wite-Out

11:57.317 --> 11:59.186
on all those canisters.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.254
There's got to be
some sort of sneaky way

12:01.288 --> 12:03.223
to, like, put it together
and a little bit faster.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.992
- We know that the canister is
mild steel and not hardenable,

12:05.025 --> 12:07.327
but Kelly's doing
something genius.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.463
She took a piece of W2 steel,
and she welded that

12:10.497 --> 12:13.333
to the top of her cans,
so that when she goes

12:13.366 --> 12:15.903
to forge-weld those
billets together--

12:15.936 --> 12:18.005
- She has a hard core.
- She has hard to hard.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.207
- The W2 hacks will go
towards the center of my blade,

12:20.240 --> 12:23.210
so I'll have bad stuff,
good stuff,

12:23.243 --> 12:25.445
good stuff,
good stuff, bad stuff.

12:25.478 --> 12:29.416
And I can grind the bad stuff
off of the blade edge.

12:29.449 --> 12:33.921
- I'm using 52100 ball bearings
combined with the 1095.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.824
With canister Damascus,
the hardest part

12:36.857 --> 12:37.858
is getting that shell off.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.993
So I'm simply not.

12:40.027 --> 12:43.163
But it's important to keep
the hardenable steel centered

12:43.196 --> 12:44.965
because that will be my edge.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.968
Cook.
Cook, you bastard.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.403
I have no idea what
I'm gonna forge.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.540
It really depends on
how much steel I end up with,

12:53.573 --> 12:56.276
'cause according to my math,
I'm only gonna end up

12:56.309 --> 12:59.246
with about 8 cubic inches
of useable material.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.115
If I do a third--
Oh, no. Okay, hold on.

13:02.149 --> 13:06.519
I may only end up
with about three pieces--

13:06.553 --> 13:08.555
Oh, the logic
on that doesn't work.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.925
[bleep]. Now I'm not 100%
sure that's the right--

13:11.959 --> 13:14.461
*

13:14.494 --> 13:16.263
I'm not a mathematician.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.431
*

13:18.465 --> 13:20.500
- The other bladesmiths
are talking about math

13:20.533 --> 13:22.903
and square footage
and cubic footage,

13:22.936 --> 13:24.537
and I'm like...

13:24.571 --> 13:27.875
So my plan is
to use the Wite-Out,

13:27.908 --> 13:29.576
cut the cans off,
and use the two types

13:29.609 --> 13:31.411
of ball bearings.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.314
So I get my first can
in the forge,

13:34.347 --> 13:36.583
and how long do I
actually leave it in there?

13:36.616 --> 13:39.252
- I know these cans
are smaller,

13:39.286 --> 13:41.521
but I'm worried that Neil
has not gone far enough

13:41.554 --> 13:43.623
down through the process
to truly get a good weld

13:43.656 --> 13:45.558
inside that can.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.527
- Yeah, and as soon
as it's open,

13:47.560 --> 13:49.396
all bets are off.
- Yeah.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.899
- Oh, [bleep] me.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.266
Ta-da,
it's not forged well.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.969
[laughs]
It didn't weld.

13:56.003 --> 14:00.073
Now I know I have to leave
the other cans in there longer.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.609
- One hour
has already elapsed!

14:02.642 --> 14:06.179
You have just two hours
remaining to finish your blades!

14:06.213 --> 14:08.281
*

14:08.315 --> 14:10.450
Ben, how much better is it to be
sitting there than out there?

14:10.483 --> 14:12.485
- I feel like
an ex-gladiator

14:12.519 --> 14:15.889
that's now sitting up
with all of the emperors.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.158
- I put a big cube
in each one of the boxes,

14:18.191 --> 14:20.360
as well as some
of the ball bearings.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.462
The steel feels like
it's welded together

14:22.495 --> 14:24.397
inside the canisters.

14:24.431 --> 14:25.999
So now it's time to start
getting those canisters

14:26.033 --> 14:27.567
off the outside.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.003
- Since he lit all that
Wite-Out on fire,

14:30.037 --> 14:32.172
I think he's gonna have
a lot of places in there

14:32.205 --> 14:33.974
that stuck together.

14:34.007 --> 14:37.177
- The one side peels off
fairly easily.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.312
Ha!

14:39.346 --> 14:42.249
But the other side doesn't
want to come off at all.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.584
I smash.
Make mess.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.520
As I expected,
getting the canisters

14:47.554 --> 14:50.523
off of the blocks of steel
is just a total--

14:50.557 --> 14:52.525
[groans]

14:52.559 --> 14:55.662
Golf clubs look easy,
at this point.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.131
Give me the golf clubs.
I'll do that again.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.133
*

15:00.167 --> 15:02.069
- I'm real confident
with my canister weld.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.670
I've never really had
any trouble with it.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.039
I've put all sorts of
stupid things in cans.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.674
Get off my thing,
you little bastard.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.642
I made a knife
out of my washing machine

15:09.676 --> 15:11.411
because it made me angry.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.514
- The masterful hammer strikes
that she's doing

15:14.547 --> 15:16.416
to open up the canisters
is amazing.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.518
- That doesn't surprise me.
She's a farrier.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.487
*

15:20.520 --> 15:23.390
- I got the steel
in the cans welded.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.293
Now I'm trying to forge-weld
the cans together.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.997
I'm going to try and fold
the one over the other one

15:30.030 --> 15:31.698
and make a stack of three

15:31.731 --> 15:34.334
and see if they'll stick
together to themselves.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.303
*

15:36.336 --> 15:39.439
I can see that my pieces
aren't welding together.

15:39.472 --> 15:42.309
Oh, come on, you [bleep].

15:42.342 --> 15:46.279
- Neil's been struggling, trying
to get three different sections

15:46.313 --> 15:48.481
folded over
and forge-welded together.

15:48.515 --> 15:52.319
- I feel like the judges
are here to not only break us

15:52.352 --> 15:55.422
but prove why we can be
Champion of Champions.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.190
I think it's a huge honor,

15:57.224 --> 15:58.758
and I think you should be broken
to earn it.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.094
So I can't quit.

16:01.128 --> 16:04.564
- I would take a second
to weld excessively.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.633
Make sure it's not
going anywhere

16:06.666 --> 16:08.701
and just squish the
ever-living [bleep] out of it.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.603
*

16:10.637 --> 16:13.273
As a teacher,
it's difficult to watch

16:13.306 --> 16:15.475
Neil struggle with his welds.

16:15.508 --> 16:19.579
I want him to succeed
so that when I win against him,

16:19.612 --> 16:21.481
it's even more rewarding.
[chuckles]

16:21.514 --> 16:24.617
- Now, Theo's billet's
looking really sharp.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.319
- Yep. And he's doing something
really smart.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.255
He's not drawing out
right away.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.623
He's just setting, setting,
setting those welds,

16:30.657 --> 16:32.625
making sure that
they're flawless.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.295
- 60 minutes remaining
to finish you blades!

16:35.328 --> 16:38.398
- Seems to be going together

16:38.431 --> 16:43.336
in a sort of messy,
nasty-looking pile of crap.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.472
I have all just
gnarly bits on it,

16:45.505 --> 16:48.541
which I hope are surface
imperfections

16:48.575 --> 16:50.810
that I can get down to good
steel in the middle of it.

16:50.843 --> 16:55.148
- I can actually see creases
down the edge of Nick's billet.

16:55.182 --> 16:58.085
- You can still see those flakes
hanging off the edge.

16:58.118 --> 17:02.255
- I need to grind that stuff off
so I can get it heat-treated.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.324
*

17:04.357 --> 17:08.828
- I'm feeling exhausted,
beat down,

17:08.861 --> 17:10.330
frustrated.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.699
Holy [bleep].

17:12.732 --> 17:14.667
I can do a lot
in a small amount of time

17:14.701 --> 17:16.569
as long as it's
stuck together.

17:16.603 --> 17:19.806
I'm just trying to get it
stuck together.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.075
- He's got those
delams everywhere.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.443
It's separating at the tip.
- Yeah.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.612
He's just trying to
hammer them out.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.748
- I've hit the full
panic mode.

17:28.781 --> 17:33.153
I realize that I will
have nothing

17:33.186 --> 17:35.788
to turn in to the judges.

17:35.822 --> 17:39.559
- If he doesn't put a knife in,
he's going home.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.162
[screams]
[bleep]!

17:44.264 --> 17:47.434
*

17:47.467 --> 17:51.371
I realize
that I will have nothing

17:51.404 --> 17:54.307
to turn in
to the judges.

17:54.341 --> 17:57.377
I told myself that if I get
stuck with a problem,

17:57.410 --> 17:59.446
then I need to abandon it,

17:59.479 --> 18:03.116
no matter what time
I have left on the clock.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.684
- Holy [bleep].

18:04.717 --> 18:06.553
Neil just grabbed
one of the small canisters.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.421
He's filling it
with ball bearings.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.623
- No way.
- He's grabbing another billet

18:10.657 --> 18:13.626
to start over with 35 minutes
left on the clock.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.896
- I don't think it's possible.
- We've seen miracles happen.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.166
- I'll die trying to make it.

18:19.199 --> 18:24.271
*

18:24.304 --> 18:26.473
- Kelly, in the quench.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.375
*

18:28.408 --> 18:31.244
She should have hard steel
all the way around.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.679
- It's so very soft.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.614
[bleep].

18:34.647 --> 18:37.384
I'm assuming it's just
the mild steel jacket.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.253
So I have to just go to town
with the angle grinder,

18:40.287 --> 18:43.323
trying to find a hard piece
in there somewhere

18:43.356 --> 18:45.192
so that I can do
a second heat treat.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.659
*

18:46.693 --> 18:48.261
- Nick just quenched.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.630
[Neil screams]
Come on!

18:50.663 --> 18:52.165
[Wil laughs]

18:52.199 --> 18:54.334
- I do make this thing at home

18:54.367 --> 18:57.737
where I take a 2-inch-by-2-inch
piece of steel

18:57.770 --> 19:01.241
and draw it out
as an example to show.

19:01.274 --> 19:04.211
So I know I can draw
a single can out pretty far.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.779
- 2 inches wide
by a 1/4 inch thick.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.881
You get 18 inches out
if you lose zero.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.518
Won't all these guys
be mad if he gets

19:11.551 --> 19:13.386
enough blade
out of one canister?

19:13.420 --> 19:15.255
*

19:15.288 --> 19:17.490
Neil is a freaking magic man.
Look at that.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.259
- He can leave can
on the outside.

19:19.292 --> 19:22.429
All he needs to do is expose
that center steel

19:22.462 --> 19:25.398
so he has hardened steel
on the edge of that knife.

19:25.432 --> 19:29.302
- Theo...letting his blade
cool down quite a bit.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.937
- Yeah.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.240
- I need to normalize
this blade.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.641
It's undergone a lot
of transformation.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.676
But it's big and thick
and heavy,

19:36.709 --> 19:39.212
so I can see that it's gonna be
down to the last minute.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.781
If this comes out
of the quench really warped,

19:41.814 --> 19:44.584
I'm gonna have
seconds to fix it.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.419
So fingers crossed.

19:46.453 --> 19:48.588
*

19:48.621 --> 19:51.658
- Theo and Kelly are in.
Come on, here we go.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.260
- Whoo!
- All right.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.794
- Neil's in.
- All the blades are in.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.764
- [bleep]!
[screams]

19:57.797 --> 19:59.832
*

19:59.866 --> 20:04.837
- Five, four, three,
two, one!

20:04.871 --> 20:06.706
Bladesmiths, shut
down your machines!

20:06.739 --> 20:11.711
Drop your tools, because
this champion's round is over!

20:11.744 --> 20:16.283
- This is the ugliest thing
I have ever made in my life.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.851
[chuckling]
But I put it all out there--

20:18.885 --> 20:20.720
everything I had.

20:20.753 --> 20:24.691
And that, to me, is what
I see as a champion.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.859
*

20:26.893 --> 20:30.330
- Bladesmiths, that was an
amazing round of competition.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.532
Now it's time for the judges
to take a closer look

20:32.565 --> 20:33.633
at your work.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.602
Theo, you're up first.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.904
*

20:37.937 --> 20:40.273
- The handle seems small

20:40.307 --> 20:42.609
in terms of its balance
for the blade.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.945
The way it is right now,
it's very forward-heavy.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.315
So hopefully you'll be able
to flare that out.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.616
Have an anchor here
to protect it

20:49.649 --> 20:51.518
from going away
from your hand.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.985
- Kelly, you're next.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.521
Please present your blade
to the judges.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.656
*

20:56.689 --> 20:59.592
- Well, Kelly, it's a beast.

20:59.626 --> 21:00.827
- [chuckles]

21:00.860 --> 21:02.562
- I like
the overall shape of it.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.397
The welds all seem
very tight.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.599
It's got a little bit of a warp,

21:06.633 --> 21:08.868
but that's well within grinder
range for something this thick.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.537
*

21:10.570 --> 21:12.004
- Nick, you're up.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.506
Please present your blade
to the judges.

21:13.540 --> 21:16.075
*

21:16.108 --> 21:18.478
- Well, Nick,
I see some issues

21:18.511 --> 21:20.480
with the cans that you
welded together.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.716
There's a lot
of delamination,

21:23.750 --> 21:26.018
and the big issue, you could put
a playing card in there.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.521
It's quite a massive crack.

21:28.555 --> 21:31.758
- I'm very worried that
a lot of that Wite-Out

21:31.791 --> 21:34.861
was still in those cans
back in here.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.063
That seam is running
from there to there,

21:37.096 --> 21:39.065
up the middle of this.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.767
And if this progresses
and as you remove this,

21:40.800 --> 21:42.669
my biggest concern is that
you're gonna open up

21:42.702 --> 21:45.872
areas in this knife
that are virtually hollow.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.907
- Neil, you're up.

21:47.940 --> 21:51.077
*

21:51.110 --> 21:53.546
- Well, Neil, if I were
these three guys,

21:53.580 --> 21:55.548
I'd be mad as hell at you,

21:55.582 --> 21:57.484
because you just
showed them they wasted

21:57.517 --> 22:00.620
two and a half hours
and multiple canisters

22:00.653 --> 22:03.856
to do what they could have done
with one can and 32 minutes.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.859
Needless to say,
it's a little rough.

22:06.893 --> 22:12.632
But the welds are tight,
and, my God, it's a knife.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.535
Well done.
- Thank you.

22:15.568 --> 22:19.439
- Bladesmiths, the judges have
completed their deliberation.

22:19.472 --> 22:22.542
It's time for one of you
bladesmiths to leave the Forge.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.811
*

22:24.844 --> 22:28.381
Nick, your blade
did not make the cut.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.583
- Nick, first off,
your energy in this forge

22:30.617 --> 22:33.386
is infectious.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.522
But in the end,
it came down to

22:35.555 --> 22:38.591
the deep void that runs
down the center of that blade.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.126
And that's why we've
got to let you go.

22:40.159 --> 22:42.762
I don't think there's
any way we can fix that.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.431
- Ow.

22:44.464 --> 22:45.932
- Nick, please surrender
your blade.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.567
*

22:47.600 --> 22:49.602
- I completely agree
with the judges.

22:49.636 --> 22:52.472
It looks like [bleep].
Beep that part.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.641
It's very frustrating
having made something

22:54.674 --> 22:56.576
that I'm not really proud of.

22:56.609 --> 23:00.647
But I'm still a champion,
so I'm doing all right.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.449
[imitates crying]
No, not really.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.984
*

23:05.017 --> 23:07.019
- Bladesmiths, congratulations.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.489
You've made it
to the second round.

23:09.522 --> 23:12.191
But your work is far from over
in this tournament of champions.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.461
Of course, in this
round of competition,

23:14.494 --> 23:15.928
you will be placing
handles on your blades

23:15.962 --> 23:17.930
to turn them into
fully functional weapons.

23:17.964 --> 23:20.533
You will have three hours
in this round.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.035
Your time starts now.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.704
*

23:24.737 --> 23:26.473
- And away we go.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.174
- Who do you think
has the most work to do?

23:28.207 --> 23:29.876
- I would say it's Kelly.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.744
The amount of steel she has
on her blade

23:31.778 --> 23:33.045
has to be ground out.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.213
- Up on your soapbox, huh?

23:34.246 --> 23:36.148
- I'm up on my box.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.785
So my plan for round two
is to camp out at the grinder

23:38.818 --> 23:40.152
for quite some time.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.488
I've got a big old knife.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.656
*

23:43.690 --> 23:46.693
My biggest concern is there's
not enough sanding belts

23:46.726 --> 23:48.495
in the state of New York

23:48.528 --> 23:50.563
for three of us
to finish our knives.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.665
I'm keeping an eyeball on Theo

23:52.699 --> 23:55.167
to make sure he's not robbing
all the good belts.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.470
I want my half of the belts,
damn it. [chuckles]

23:57.504 --> 23:59.038
- Very first thing
I'm gonna have to do

23:59.071 --> 24:00.940
is address the judges' concern

24:00.973 --> 24:02.208
that the handle seemed
a little bit small.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.110
There we go.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.646
- Theo, just to extend that
handle a little bit,

24:06.679 --> 24:08.247
and he's actually welded a
section

24:08.280 --> 24:10.850
to make his tang longer.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.752
- I want to make sure I made
a handle large enough

24:12.785 --> 24:14.220
for the judges.

24:14.253 --> 24:15.722
Can I get some hands on this?
- No.

24:15.755 --> 24:16.723
- Your hands are
bigger than mine.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.491
- Go over there.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.059
What are you doing over here?
Get out of here.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.861
We all looked at him
like he was on drugs.

24:21.894 --> 24:22.829
- I almost grabbed it.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.964
- Whatever.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.999
I have to just imagine that
my hand was sausage fingers.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.001
*

24:29.035 --> 24:31.704
- So the one genius thing
I think that Neil has done

24:31.738 --> 24:34.974
is he's set us up with the
expectation of a rustic blade.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.510
[laughter]

24:37.544 --> 24:40.112
- My design is like a two-piece
handle construction

24:40.146 --> 24:42.815
or four
or I don't know.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.884
Two per side,
I guess.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.686
[laughs]

24:46.719 --> 24:48.888
After winning "Forged in Fire,"

24:48.921 --> 24:51.524
I noticed
that I sell a lot of knives

24:51.558 --> 24:53.726
to first-time knife buyers.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.662
Typically, the majority
of them are girls.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.630
People better watch out.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.566
There's a lot of armed girls
out there now.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.834
[laughs]

25:01.868 --> 25:05.004
- We're about an hour
and 45 minutes into this,

25:05.037 --> 25:08.274
and Kelly hasn't stepped
away from the grinder yet.

25:08.307 --> 25:09.976
- Just need to get
a handle on,

25:10.009 --> 25:11.277
and then I can go back
to the grinder

25:11.310 --> 25:12.779
and work on my blade
some more.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.914
What do we got?

25:14.947 --> 25:16.983
- You can slap a handle on
pretty quickly if you have to.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.685
I just hate to see people
putting a handle on

25:18.718 --> 25:19.752
as an afterthought.

25:19.786 --> 25:21.320
- I used to get popsicles

25:21.353 --> 25:23.189
that looked just like this
when I was a kid.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.957
My biggest concern
about coming back

25:24.991 --> 25:28.227
is failing miserably
and being sent home

25:28.260 --> 25:30.162
on a Greyhound
'cause I don't even deserve,

25:30.196 --> 25:31.964
like, an airplane ticket.

25:31.998 --> 25:34.333
- There are just 60
tiny little minutes

25:34.366 --> 25:36.836
left on the clock!

25:36.869 --> 25:39.038
- I liked the blue theme
of the original chopper I made,

25:39.071 --> 25:40.973
and I decided to keep with it.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.175
Bluing the spine actually
helps the blade absorb shock,

25:43.209 --> 25:45.211
so it's nice and soft
in the spine

25:45.244 --> 25:47.246
and shock absorbing
for that ice chop.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.782
- He's softening the spine
to make sure that if anything

25:49.816 --> 25:51.918
were to happen,
it doesn't snap in two.

25:51.951 --> 25:55.755
- I went with a synthetic
material that I think is paper

25:55.788 --> 25:58.791
and other [bleep] I'm not
exactly sure about,

25:58.825 --> 26:01.761
but it matched the theme,
so I just kind of went with it.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.663
I think I was invited back

26:03.696 --> 26:05.164
because of the terrible jokes
that I told.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.133
I bought a dog
from a blacksmith.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.768
I know the dog
was from a blacksmith,

26:08.801 --> 26:10.202
because as soon
as I got him home,

26:10.236 --> 26:11.971
he made a bolt
for the door.

26:12.004 --> 26:14.941
[imitates rim shot]

26:14.974 --> 26:16.943
*

26:16.976 --> 26:21.080
- I finish off my handle,
so I decide to go straight

26:21.113 --> 26:23.616
to the acid etch, because
why are you gonna do

26:23.650 --> 26:26.352
canister Damascus
and not acid-etch it?

26:26.385 --> 26:27.854
That's the whole point.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.622
I want to see what's in there.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.123
- Ten minutes!

26:31.157 --> 26:33.225
- I'm running out of time.

26:33.259 --> 26:36.228
So I decide I need to leave
my handle fairly rough

26:36.262 --> 26:38.264
and try and put
an edge on it.

26:38.297 --> 26:41.133
Once I start getting down
to where it's tapering

26:41.167 --> 26:43.102
and looking more like an edge,

26:43.135 --> 26:45.104
I see, like, a little crack
showing up.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.273
Like, right on
the edge of the blade.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.408
I'm a little nervous,
but I don't have time

26:49.441 --> 26:51.377
to do anything about it.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.045
Bad Kelly.

26:53.079 --> 26:58.718
- Five, four, three,
two, one!

26:58.751 --> 27:02.354
Bladesmiths, drop your tools.
This round is over.

27:02.388 --> 27:05.091
*

27:05.124 --> 27:07.126
- I'm happy
I finished my blade.

27:07.159 --> 27:10.362
But I'm concerned about
delamination on the edge.

27:10.396 --> 27:12.164
I'm afraid that can be
a catastrophic failure

27:12.198 --> 27:14.233
that sends me home.

27:14.266 --> 27:17.269
- Champions, I'm gonna
take your blades.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.071
I'm gonna chop into these
ice blocks six times each.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.674
Never underestimate
ice's strength.

27:21.708 --> 27:24.076
It has sunk ships,
and it's broken blades.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.812
Neil, you're up first.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.680
- Bust them.
[laughs]

27:27.714 --> 27:29.215
*

27:29.248 --> 27:30.783
I'm nervous.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.284
If my blade chips

27:32.318 --> 27:35.221
into a million pieces
or breaks,

27:35.254 --> 27:36.823
then I'm done.

27:36.856 --> 27:43.796
*

27:46.799 --> 27:48.200
- Wow.

27:48.234 --> 27:51.303
*

27:51.337 --> 27:53.706
- Okay, Neil.
Your blade held up really well.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.775
It destroyed some ice.

27:55.808 --> 27:58.878
The handle is a little bit
wider than I'd prefer,

27:58.911 --> 28:01.147
but in all, it's a nice
heavy chopper

28:01.180 --> 28:03.215
for such a small blade
and for something made

28:03.249 --> 28:04.416
out of one canister.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.485
Nice job.
- Thank you.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.454
- Theo, you're up next.
Are you ready?

28:08.487 --> 28:10.990
- Yeah... [mutters]
Let's do it.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.992
*

28:13.025 --> 28:14.460
I'm a bit worried.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.863
But this test is
a very good icebreaker.

28:16.896 --> 28:20.199
[imitates rim shot]

28:20.232 --> 28:21.500
*

28:21.533 --> 28:22.935
Whoo!

28:22.969 --> 28:29.842
*

28:31.410 --> 28:33.112
- Holy crap.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.981
- [laughs]
He killed it.

28:35.014 --> 28:37.049
*

28:37.083 --> 28:38.885
Well, Theo,
as you can see,

28:38.918 --> 28:40.953
an extremely impressive
job on the ice.

28:40.987 --> 28:44.423
There is a little bit of
deflection of the edge up here.

28:44.456 --> 28:47.493
But overall, it held up
really well.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.095
- Thank you.

28:49.128 --> 28:50.462
- Kelly, you're up next.
You ready?

28:50.496 --> 28:52.098
- Oh, yeah.
- All right. Let's do it.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.400
*

28:54.433 --> 28:57.837
- Right now I'm
so, so, so nervous.

28:57.870 --> 29:00.006
I'm worried about those cracks
right on the edge.

29:00.039 --> 29:05.411
My blade could
very well blow apart.

29:05.444 --> 29:12.318
*

29:16.989 --> 29:18.490
[chuckles]

29:18.524 --> 29:20.192
*

29:20.226 --> 29:22.228
- Well, Kelly,
we've got some chips.

29:22.261 --> 29:26.498
I think it's right at the
forge weld near the edge here.

29:26.532 --> 29:29.468
But the rest of the blade
held up nicely.

29:29.501 --> 29:33.072
Nice job. Thank you.
- Thanks.

29:33.105 --> 29:36.042
- All right, champions,
this is the sharpness test.

29:36.075 --> 29:39.011
Now, to test the sharpness
of the edge of your blade,

29:39.045 --> 29:41.313
I'll be cutting through
these five water bottles.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.249
If your knife's sharp,
we should leave the bottom

29:43.282 --> 29:45.918
of those bottles
sitting on the deck.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.519
Neil, you ready?
- [laughs]

29:47.553 --> 29:49.121
Mine will get
thrown the farthest.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.123
[laughter]

29:51.157 --> 29:58.097
*

30:01.934 --> 30:03.602
*

30:03.635 --> 30:05.404
- Okay, Neil.

30:05.437 --> 30:09.341
That is a very stout edge.
It's sharp.

30:09.375 --> 30:11.510
We cut through three bottles,
nicked the fourth,

30:11.543 --> 30:13.379
shoved one out of the way.

30:13.412 --> 30:14.981
Well done.
- Thank you.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.315
- Theo, you're up.
Are you ready?

30:16.348 --> 30:17.483
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

30:17.516 --> 30:24.456
*

30:29.461 --> 30:31.230
*

30:31.263 --> 30:33.032
- All right,
you can see there are

30:33.065 --> 30:35.601
five water bottle bases
still on the table.

30:35.634 --> 30:37.503
They tipped over.
I'm not worried about that.

30:37.536 --> 30:38.871
All five cut.

30:38.905 --> 30:40.572
Good job.
- Thank you.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.474
- Kelly, you ready?
- I'm ready.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.610
- All right.

30:44.643 --> 30:51.583
*

30:53.219 --> 30:54.887
*

30:54.921 --> 30:56.322
That's a big knife.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.490
[laughter]

30:58.524 --> 31:01.160
We took four of these
bottles in half,

31:01.193 --> 31:04.897
but that thick profile pushed
everything out of the way.

31:04.931 --> 31:07.967
I don't even think I nicked
the last bottle.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.169
But it did the job.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.071
Nicely done.
- Thanks.

31:12.104 --> 31:14.140
- Bladesmiths, you've all done

31:14.173 --> 31:16.242
an excellent job
in this competition.

31:16.275 --> 31:19.345
However, only two can
move on to the finale.

31:19.378 --> 31:22.114
So it's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.450
*

31:24.483 --> 31:27.653
Kelly, your blade
did not make the cut.

31:27.686 --> 31:30.456
- Kelly, I really enjoy
watching you work.

31:30.489 --> 31:33.092
Nobody swings hammers
like farriers.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.194
But in the end,
those chips that popped off

31:35.227 --> 31:37.229
of your blade
in the ice chop,

31:37.263 --> 31:39.265
well, that's something
we can't overlook,

31:39.298 --> 31:40.599
and that's the reason
we're sending you home.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.334
- I understand.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.270
- Kelly, you're a
fantastic competitor,

31:44.303 --> 31:46.038
and I know the community
respects the hell out of you.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.940
But today I have to ask you

31:47.974 --> 31:49.408
to surrender your weapon
and please leave the Forge.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.377
*

31:51.410 --> 31:53.379
- In every competition
there's a winner,

31:53.412 --> 31:55.614
and there's people
that don't win.

31:55.647 --> 31:57.549
It's the Champions
of Champions,

31:57.583 --> 31:59.518
so to be in the middle
of that was pretty cool.

31:59.551 --> 32:02.188
When I get home,
I'm gonna make

32:02.221 --> 32:04.090
so many cans of Damascus.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.625
I'm gonna just start
stacking them together.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.594
I think I might just make
a Rubik's Cube

32:08.627 --> 32:10.062
out of canister Damascus.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.397
I think that would be amazing.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.633
*

32:14.666 --> 32:17.136
- Neil, Theo,
congratulations.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.438
You've made it into the finale
for this competition.

32:19.471 --> 32:22.208
There's only one thing
you have left to do.

32:22.241 --> 32:25.177
And that is to go back home
and re-create an iconic weapon

32:25.211 --> 32:26.445
from history...

32:26.478 --> 32:29.181
*

32:29.215 --> 32:31.450
The Tai Chi sword.

32:31.483 --> 32:34.153
*

32:34.186 --> 32:36.355
Emerging from China
over 2,500 years ago,

32:36.388 --> 32:38.690
the Tai Chi sword is known
as "The Gentleman of Weapons,"

32:38.724 --> 32:41.127
due to its refinement
and sophistication.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.029
Symbolizing
power and authority,

32:43.062 --> 32:45.197
the weapon is one of
the most common ancient weapons

32:45.231 --> 32:47.266
still in practice,

32:47.299 --> 32:49.335
with millions of students
studying it worldwide.

32:49.368 --> 32:50.736
Fast and light,
its straight double-edged blade

32:50.769 --> 32:53.339
was used for quick stabs
and lethal cuts,

32:53.372 --> 32:55.641
while the sword's fairly blunt
lower section

32:55.674 --> 32:57.676
was built
to block and deflect attacks.

32:57.709 --> 33:00.512
Its reputation is also
preserved in popular culture

33:00.546 --> 33:03.215
through its role as the coveted
Green Destiny sword

33:03.249 --> 33:06.085
in the film "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon."

33:06.118 --> 33:08.020
Your blade
must be double-edged,

33:08.054 --> 33:10.789
have a winged guard,
and pommel.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.159
- Last time I was on the show,
I made a naginata.

33:13.192 --> 33:16.462
In comparison, the Tai Chi
sword has a lot more blade.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.665
It's gonna be
a lot of work.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.400
- You will have five days

33:21.433 --> 33:23.135
at your home forge
to accomplish this.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.803
At the end of five days,
you will return

33:24.836 --> 33:27.073
and present your work to
our panel of expert judges.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.175
And only after they've
brutally tested them

33:29.208 --> 33:30.776
will they declare one of you

33:30.809 --> 33:32.544
the "Forged in Fire"
Champion of Champions

33:32.578 --> 33:34.780
and give you that cash.

33:34.813 --> 33:37.516
- I'm concerned because the
Tai Chi sword is really light.

33:37.549 --> 33:41.787
I probably have regular knives
that are heavier

33:41.820 --> 33:43.289
than that whole sword.

33:43.322 --> 33:45.691
So that's a challenge for me.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.726
- Good luck, bladesmiths.
We'll see you in five days.

33:47.759 --> 33:50.096
- Best of luck, man.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.731
*

33:52.764 --> 33:56.202
- It's a definite honor to be
in the position that I'm at.

33:56.235 --> 33:59.071
I got to build
a Tai Chi sword.

33:59.105 --> 34:01.473
I think they're confused.
I'm not Chinese.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.709
[laughs]
It's gonna be a hard job.

34:03.742 --> 34:08.080
This is the first time I've
ever made something this long.

34:08.114 --> 34:09.148
Holy [bleep].

34:09.181 --> 34:11.383
But I'm never gonna quit.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.519
*

34:13.552 --> 34:15.587
It's heavy.

34:15.621 --> 34:18.190
I guarantee you mine's gonna be
heavier than Theo's.

34:18.224 --> 34:19.491
I don't like
skinny little things.

34:19.525 --> 34:20.726
I like things with some stout.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.161
[laughs]

34:22.194 --> 34:24.430
This thing's monster.

34:24.463 --> 34:27.099
*

34:27.133 --> 34:28.667
- Here we are at my forge.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.402
The very first thing
I'm gonna do

34:30.436 --> 34:32.138
is start forge-welding
things together.

34:32.171 --> 34:33.739
Please go right.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.707
The biggest obstacle

34:35.741 --> 34:38.144
is the raw amount of forging
I have to do,

34:38.177 --> 34:40.846
then getting the guard to
forge-weld to the blade itself,

34:40.879 --> 34:43.815
and then being able to forge
the pommel on it as well.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.617
If the welds don't hold,

34:45.651 --> 34:48.154
everything
will be coming apart.

34:48.187 --> 34:50.589
How important are
guards on swords?

34:50.622 --> 34:52.591
They can be integral.

34:52.624 --> 34:54.560
[imitates rim shot]

34:54.593 --> 34:57.663
- I really need to make
a guard for this sword.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.631
It needs a guard
that's winged up.

34:59.665 --> 35:02.334
So what better than a bowl?

35:02.368 --> 35:05.237
There's a lot of pressure
to build something

35:05.271 --> 35:06.905
Champion of Champion-worthy.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.308
But I don't want to lose
who I am,

35:09.341 --> 35:13.145
which is taking anything
that anybody can get

35:13.179 --> 35:16.482
and create something
that can compete.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.650
This is, like, Chinese,
so they can eat soup out of it

35:18.684 --> 35:19.751
at the same time.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.787
[laughing]

35:21.820 --> 35:24.856
- Today's the quench.
Big moment of truth.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.826
Should have practiced
this motion with this new setup.

35:27.859 --> 35:31.497
If things go wrong right now,
I got to start again.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.299
So, no pressure.

35:33.332 --> 35:39.905
*

35:39.938 --> 35:42.474
Perfectly straight.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.410
Things went amazingly well.

35:44.443 --> 35:47.513
But now I got to work
on the handle material.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.381
It's definitely gonna be
the most challenging part

35:49.415 --> 35:50.849
of this weapon.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.185
Oh, come on, Theo.
[bleep] Christ.

35:53.219 --> 35:55.554
If I don't get this to sit well
inside of the little valley

35:55.587 --> 35:59.491
that I've created here,
it's gonna look horrible.

35:59.525 --> 36:00.892
*

36:00.926 --> 36:02.661
- Today is important.

36:02.694 --> 36:05.497
The blade has to be
heated evenly.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.533
Trying to get
the sword lighter

36:07.566 --> 36:09.301
has been
kind of difficult.

36:09.335 --> 36:11.970
And being that this is
the longest thing

36:12.003 --> 36:14.740
I've ever heat-treated,
I'm not really set up for it.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.775
*

36:19.311 --> 36:21.747
I can feel it
want to bend

36:21.780 --> 36:23.315
because of the weight
of the tip.

36:23.349 --> 36:25.551
So I am scared.

36:25.584 --> 36:30.689
If something goes wrong,
I won't have time to fix it.

36:30.722 --> 36:36.462
*

36:36.495 --> 36:38.597
- I can kind of feel it
want to bend

36:38.630 --> 36:40.566
because of the weight
of the tip.

36:40.599 --> 36:43.369
So I am a little bit scared.

36:43.402 --> 36:50.276
*

36:50.309 --> 36:52.678
My blade is straight.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.513
I don't have to re-quench it.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.515
I'm stoked.

36:56.548 --> 36:59.785
- Today's all about polishing
and finishing.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.687
I'm happy with the blade.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.789
If I win, the money
would most likely go

37:03.822 --> 37:06.258
to starting a new life
with my wife.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.626
I had to put that in there.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.361
I'd get in trouble if I didn't.

37:09.395 --> 37:11.263
Oh, God,
we're still recording.

37:11.297 --> 37:12.664
I'm sorry, Daisy.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.533
*

37:14.566 --> 37:16.802
- Theo, Neil,
welcome back to the Forge.

37:16.835 --> 37:19.471
Theo, tell us
about your blade.

37:19.505 --> 37:21.373
- It went very well.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.941
I did an integral guard
and pommel

37:22.974 --> 37:24.976
by forge-welding on
both of them.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.446
The blade's handle is
relatively simple construction

37:27.479 --> 37:30.015
so that it can be
beaten the [bleep] out of.

37:30.048 --> 37:33.352
- You sound monotone-ly
excited about that.

37:33.385 --> 37:35.387
Neil, how'd it go
for you, man?

37:35.421 --> 37:38.424
- Same recipe as
the last time I was here.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.559
Go to the junkyard,
get some stuff,

37:40.592 --> 37:42.394
because I didn't expect
to make it this far.

37:42.428 --> 37:43.995
[laughing]
- All right.

37:44.029 --> 37:46.865
Well, gentlemen,
up first is the strength test.

37:46.898 --> 37:48.967
Ben?

37:49.000 --> 37:52.304
- Champions, I'm gonna be
hitting this bamboo five times.

37:52.338 --> 37:54.973
Remember, it's not what
your sword does to the bamboo,

37:55.006 --> 37:56.808
but what the bamboo
does to your sword.

37:56.842 --> 37:59.378
Theo, you're up first.
How are you feeling?

37:59.411 --> 38:01.547
- A little nervous.
Let's go for it.

38:01.580 --> 38:08.454
*

38:16.962 --> 38:21.733
*

38:21.767 --> 38:24.069
- Well Theo, this is
a brute of a sword.

38:24.102 --> 38:27.105
The edge held up perfectly.
I don't see any problems.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.475
Still straight as an arrow.

38:29.508 --> 38:32.611
The handle is a little bit
difficult to really control.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.513
I would have liked a little bit
more meat on in,

38:34.546 --> 38:36.815
but very well done.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.016
- Thank you.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.651
- Neil, you're up next.

38:39.685 --> 38:43.021
- Boy, that's a tough test.
[laughs]

38:43.054 --> 38:44.690
That bamboo setup--

38:44.723 --> 38:47.493
it's literally
just blunt-force trauma.

38:47.526 --> 38:49.695
I don't think a lot of blades
can survive

38:49.728 --> 38:53.832
that kind
of jarring and punishment.

38:53.865 --> 39:00.772
*

39:04.142 --> 39:06.412
*

39:06.445 --> 39:08.747
- Well, Neil,
the sword is heavy.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.383
I wouldn't want to be
running around with it.

39:11.417 --> 39:14.119
There's a little bit of damage
that the bamboo gave back

39:14.152 --> 39:16.788
to your sword,
but it's still straight.

39:16.822 --> 39:19.658
Very well done. Nice job.
- Thank you.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.661
- Next up is the sharpness test.
For that, Dave.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.430
- All right, gentlemen,
I'm gonna be chopping

39:24.463 --> 39:25.731
through these tatami mats,

39:25.764 --> 39:27.833
using both edges
of your sword.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.068
Let's see if your blades
still have an edge.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.438
Theo, you're up first.
You ready for it?

39:32.471 --> 39:34.873
- Uh, yeah.
Sure.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.575
*

39:36.608 --> 39:38.076
I'm very nervous
at this point.

39:38.109 --> 39:39.945
This is the "make it
or break it" moment.

39:39.978 --> 39:43.749
I have to perform well
on this test.

39:43.782 --> 39:50.722
*

39:53.725 --> 39:55.193
- All right, Theo.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.895
Definitely a sharp blade.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.530
You can see the nice clean slice

39:58.564 --> 40:00.599
and then burying
into the second.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.101
I like the design.
It's definitely a solid piece.

40:03.134 --> 40:05.604
And that's one of
the nice things about it.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.706
I don't feel like
it's gonna go anywhere.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.641
Well done.
- Thank you.

40:09.675 --> 40:11.076
- All right, Neil.
You ready?

40:11.109 --> 40:13.078
- Yep.
[laughs]

40:13.111 --> 40:19.985
*

40:26.124 --> 40:29.127
*

40:29.160 --> 40:32.798
- So the biggest thing
is all that weight.

40:32.831 --> 40:36.668
About twice what it needs to be,
as far as weight goes.

40:36.702 --> 40:38.804
It's difficult to swing.

40:38.837 --> 40:42.073
And then the edge of this blade,
it's got a very stout profile,

40:42.107 --> 40:43.875
almost like an axe.

40:43.909 --> 40:47.779
Just kept it from cutting
all the way through.

40:47.813 --> 40:50.649
- Theo, Neil,
we took five champions.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.551
We whittled it down to two.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.085
But there can only be

40:54.119 --> 40:56.722
one "Forged in Fire"
Champion of Champions.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.524
That champion is...

40:58.557 --> 41:00.726
*

41:00.759 --> 41:02.828
Theo.
Congratulations.

41:02.861 --> 41:05.931
Neil, unfortunately, your weapon
did not make the cut.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.833
- Neil, you came up
and showed us

41:07.866 --> 41:09.501
that you had the heart
to make it to the finals

41:09.535 --> 41:11.570
and against
four other champions.

41:11.603 --> 41:14.573
But your sword took some damage
through the strength test.

41:14.606 --> 41:17.208
But more than that,
it's heavy.

41:17.242 --> 41:21.212
A Tai Chi sword is known to be
strong, sharp, and light.

41:21.246 --> 41:24.115
For those reasons,
we have to let you go.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.917
- Neil, please surrender
your weapon.

41:25.951 --> 41:29.020
- I 100% agree
with the judges.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.922
Theo earned it.

41:30.956 --> 41:33.525
But I don't look at this
as a failure in any means,

41:33.559 --> 41:35.694
because I gave it my all.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.096
I can walk away,
look everybody in the eye,

41:38.129 --> 41:39.965
and have everyone's respect.

41:39.998 --> 41:42.000
And that's worth more to me

41:42.033 --> 41:45.737
than any title
or any amount of money.

41:45.771 --> 41:47.839
*

41:47.873 --> 41:49.841
- Theo, congratulations.

41:49.875 --> 41:52.978
You are the new "Forged in Fire"
Champion of Champions

41:53.011 --> 41:54.880
and will be receiving
a check for $10,000.

41:54.913 --> 41:57.282
How do you feel right now?
- Whew.

41:57.315 --> 41:59.618
Boy, the butterflies
and the nerves are still going,

41:59.651 --> 42:01.286
but thank you, guys.

42:01.319 --> 42:03.021
- Please present your weapon
to the judges.

42:03.054 --> 42:05.691
I [bleep] won!
[grunts, laughs]

42:05.724 --> 42:08.727
My ego was pretty big
beforehand,

42:08.760 --> 42:11.296
and I think this is only going
to inflate it.

42:11.329 --> 42:14.933
Not a good thing,
not a bad thing...

42:14.966 --> 42:16.034
I think.

42:16.067 --> 42:17.002
*
