00:18.184 --> 00:21.312
lt's just a passport photo,
not the cover of Vogue.

00:21.388 --> 00:25.324
There's no reason l have to look
like hell in it, is there? Settle down.

00:25.392 --> 00:29.385
- We're on a schedule here.
- l know we're on a schedule here.

00:35.435 --> 00:37.130
Act natural.

00:46.613 --> 00:50.572
- l'll be back in ten.
- Make it five. l'll be around back.

00:50.650 --> 00:52.584
Relax, Billy.

01:00.026 --> 01:02.290
Lower itjust a bit. Yeah, that's it.

01:04.763 --> 01:07.130
Now, big smile. Yeah, hold it.

01:08.935 --> 01:13.269
- Big trip you got planned?
- Oh, you know, nothin' special.

01:13.339 --> 01:15.273
Just good to have a passport.

01:16.142 --> 01:19.634
lt looks like it's clearing up.
Might be a nice day after all.

01:20.146 --> 01:22.546
lt's just gonna take a few minutes.

01:25.685 --> 01:28.449
That comes to $6.95.

01:31.491 --> 01:34.392
Great. l left my money in the car.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.929
- l'll be back.
- l'll be here.

01:56.049 --> 01:58.847
Ow! Hey, you jerk!

02:01.721 --> 02:03.586
What?

02:10.363 --> 02:12.297
Billy?

02:14.367 --> 02:17.894
Billy, someone did something to me. Billy?

03:01.481 --> 03:03.346
Shoot.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.916
My God!

04:08.915 --> 04:11.349
What are your thoughts, Scully?

04:11.417 --> 04:15.251
Have the local police been
contacted by her abductor?

04:15.321 --> 04:19.620
- No demand for ransom?
- No, unfortunately. lt's going on three days.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.257
Any additional leads?

04:22.328 --> 04:26.025
No. No hair and fiber evidence.
The rain washed it all away.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.624
The autopsy came back
on the dead boyfriend.

04:28.701 --> 04:31.966
A puncture wound through
the eardrum and into the brain,

04:32.038 --> 04:34.199
possibly from a long needle or an awl.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.175
l'm still not sure how we figure
into this investigation.

04:37.243 --> 04:39.473
Did you see the photo?

04:39.545 --> 04:42.207
l assume that was taken by her abductor.

04:42.282 --> 04:46.776
lt was taken by a 65-year-old druggist
moments before she was abducted.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.378
That's a passport photo
from a local drugstore.

04:49.455 --> 04:53.289
The druggist was the last known person
to have seen Mary Lefante.

04:53.359 --> 04:55.987
He claims that wasn't the photo
he was taking.

04:56.062 --> 04:58.656
He says the photo
he was taking was normal.

04:58.731 --> 05:01.564
He only came to the police
when he heard she was missing.

05:01.634 --> 05:06.196
Well, whoever took this photo was
obviously privy to the woman's abduction.

05:06.272 --> 05:09.070
That is what you would think.

05:12.011 --> 05:15.947
lt's the damnedest thing.
Here it is, just like l left it.

05:16.015 --> 05:18.074
lt was under lock and key.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.381
- ls that where you keep it?
- Yeah.

05:20.453 --> 05:23.547
- Mind if l take a look?
- Please, help yourself.

05:25.024 --> 05:28.721
At first l thought l did something wrong
when l took the picture.

05:28.961 --> 05:33.830
There's that piece of paper you have
to pull off. You have to do thatjust right.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.762
l'm sure you did itjust fine.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.862
- Your film's out of date.
- ls that against the law?

05:40.073 --> 05:45.101
- No. l was just making an observation.
- l don't get much call for passport photos.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.272
The copy shop over at the mall
does 'em cheaper.

05:50.450 --> 05:51.781
Excuse me.

05:51.851 --> 05:55.582
l sure hope you find that
young woman safe and sound.

06:01.861 --> 06:05.661
Which one of us gets to use the stun gun
on Bruno Hauptmann back there?

06:05.732 --> 06:08.667
So he doesn't exactly stand out as a suspect.

06:08.735 --> 06:12.603
Mulder, take a look at this.
You see this smeariness here?

06:13.339 --> 06:15.239
l'm thinking it's heat damage.

06:15.308 --> 06:20.302
With the heater sitting under the film,
the emulsion probably melted.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.043
That would make it look like
she posed screaming for a passport photo?

06:24.117 --> 06:26.312
Plus, the film is two years out of date.

06:26.386 --> 06:31.653
The photographic chemistry could've
changed. The dyes... fade, they...

06:31.724 --> 06:35.717
- All right, so what's your theory?
- l'm not sure l have a theory.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.497
- Excuse me. You the two FBl agents?
- Agents Mulder and Scully.

06:42.568 --> 06:47.505
Sorry to have brought you all this way.
l'm afraid we might have wasted your time.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.571
Hey, Trott.

07:05.792 --> 07:09.159
lnspector Puett,
these are Agents Scully and Mulder.

07:09.228 --> 07:11.162
- Agents.
- lnspector.

07:11.230 --> 07:14.893
US postal inspector.
My office is investigating a mail theft...

07:14.967 --> 07:18.562
..which we've traced to your missing person,
Ms Mary Louise Lefante.

07:18.638 --> 07:20.105
She was a postal employee.

07:20.173 --> 07:24.906
A sorter at the Kurland Hills branch.
A number of unsigned credit cards

07:24.977 --> 07:29.243
in transit through that branch
never made it to their respective owners.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.044
She was intercepting them?

07:31.117 --> 07:36.214
And her boyfriend was signing them.
We ran him. He was into forgery, check fraud.

07:36.289 --> 07:40.851
Mary Lefante's passport photo. Do you know
how soon she wanted to leave town?

07:40.927 --> 07:43.919
- Did she know about your investigation?
- Probably.

07:43.996 --> 07:48.228
Though we didn't focus on her specifically
until after she came up missing.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.930
- You think she faked her disappearance?
- Looks that way to me.

07:52.004 --> 07:55.462
Yeah, but why would she stab
her boyfriend through the ear?

07:56.609 --> 07:59.043
The magic was gone?

07:59.111 --> 08:01.602
Did you find a camera anywhere here?

08:11.557 --> 08:15.755
You think this woman planted
that photo of herself in the drugstore?

08:15.828 --> 08:18.922
- What would be the point of that?
- l...

08:21.400 --> 08:23.493
Here it is.

08:26.105 --> 08:28.369
Stand back, Scully. lt's loaded.

08:29.809 --> 08:33.267
- What are you doing?
- ln the '60s a bellhop named Ted Serios

08:33.346 --> 08:37.282
became famous for taking
what he called ''thoughtographs''.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.409
He claimed that by concentrating
on an unexposed negative

08:40.486 --> 08:45.446
he could create a photographic
representation of what he saw in his mind.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.653
He did landscapes, cathedrals,
the Queen of England...

08:48.728 --> 08:51.356
- Thoughtographs.
- Also known as scotographs.

08:51.430 --> 08:55.264
Literature on thought photography
dates back almost to Louis Daguerre.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.529
So that makes it legitimate?

08:58.704 --> 09:00.865
Look at that.

09:01.407 --> 09:03.932
Oh, my God!

09:08.915 --> 09:11.645
- l think he was here, Scully.
- Who was here?

09:11.717 --> 09:15.050
Mary Lefante's abductor.
l think he stalked her.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.917
He could have come up right here.

09:19.992 --> 09:23.928
l think he came in here and looked at her
through the window, this close.

09:23.996 --> 09:26.362
Close enough to affect the camera film.

09:26.432 --> 09:28.798
Psychic photography?

09:28.868 --> 09:32.395
Mulder, it's obvious
that somebody doctored these images

09:32.471 --> 09:36.840
and planted them to be found here.
Maybe as some kind of a smoke screen.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.343
To conceal what? This isn't about mail fraud.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.846
That's just incidental. What if...

09:41.914 --> 09:44.678
What if someone had this ability?

09:44.750 --> 09:48.208
An image like this
would be a peek into that person's mind.

09:48.287 --> 09:52.383
- lnto their darkest fantasies?
- The fantasy of a killer.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.399
She's completely non-responsive.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.903
We did a tox screen and found traces
of morphine and scopolamine.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.404
- Twilite Sleep.
- The dental anesthetic?

10:40.473 --> 10:43.306
A painkiller cocktail.
lt's also for women in labor.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.776
- Would that account for her condition?
- No.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.843
What would?

10:48.514 --> 10:50.482
Give her a PET scan.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.622
All set.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.525
Oh, my God!

11:06.599 --> 11:08.863
What is it?

11:08.934 --> 11:14.873
She's been given a transorbital lobotomy.
lt used to be known as an ice-pick lobotomy.

11:14.940 --> 11:18.967
lt involves inserting a leucotome
through the eye sockets.

11:19.645 --> 11:22.239
We're looking for a doctor?
Someone with training?

11:22.314 --> 11:27.013
- Notjudging by this.
- Whoever did this, Mulder, did it wrong.

11:27.086 --> 11:29.020
Un...

11:30.723 --> 11:33.021
Un...

11:34.060 --> 11:36.358
Unruhe.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.663
Unruhe.

11:39.999 --> 11:43.230
- Mary.
- Un...

11:44.737 --> 11:46.034
Un...

11:46.105 --> 11:48.505
You'd better go in there and get her.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.341
Unruhe.

12:00.753 --> 12:02.618
Unruhe.

12:04.423 --> 12:06.220
Unruhe.

12:07.093 --> 12:10.062
We just got the call.
There's been a second abduction.

12:10.129 --> 12:12.097
Unruhe.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.570
You can roll. We're set here.

12:54.039 --> 12:57.031
Get that area taped off.

13:04.049 --> 13:06.040
Watch it.

13:06.552 --> 13:08.713
Excuse me, ma'am.

13:13.559 --> 13:17.893
- Mulder?
- Charles Selchik, certified public accountant.

13:17.963 --> 13:22.366
Dead from a stab wound through the ear.
Cleaning crew found the body.

13:22.434 --> 13:26.336
- What about the missing woman?
- His secretary, Alice Brandt, age 32.

13:26.405 --> 13:28.669
The family says
she was working late last night.

13:28.741 --> 13:33.644
- What's her connection to the first victim?
- Apparently none. But the MO is the same.

13:33.712 --> 13:36.476
- Yeah. The clock is running.
- Yeah.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.950
l keep thinking about what Mary Lefante
was repeating: ''unruhe.''

13:40.019 --> 13:44.922
The Michigan phone book has three different
spellings, but none within 80 miles of here.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.855
lt might be significant as a word.

13:46.926 --> 13:51.056
That's what l've been thinking.
ln German it means ''trouble'' or ''strife.''

13:51.130 --> 13:54.429
- Unrest.
- You took German in high school, Scully?

13:54.500 --> 13:58.061
- College.
- Unrest, huh?

13:58.137 --> 14:01.436
l'm working on these crime-scene photos
from the first abduction.

14:01.507 --> 14:06.843
lf we're lucky, the abductor gets a thrill
from returning to the scene of a crime.

14:06.912 --> 14:08.504
He wasn't there, Scully.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.981
- How do you know?
- lt would've affected the photos.

14:11.050 --> 14:14.178
- Trott, what did you find?
- Nothing much.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.653
There's no cameras or film here whatsoever.

14:16.722 --> 14:20.783
lt's all just accountants' offices,
so l don't know why there would be.

14:21.927 --> 14:25.454
ls that what we're looking for?
Evidence of psychic photography?

14:25.531 --> 14:27.158
lt may be the only evidence we get.

14:27.233 --> 14:30.100
l've got a forensics team coming from Detroit.

14:30.169 --> 14:33.764
What's here for them to find?
This guy's very good at what he does.

14:33.839 --> 14:36.433
He's left no witnesses, no latent prints...

14:36.508 --> 14:40.467
Only those photos, which makes me believe
he doesn't know he has that ability.

14:40.546 --> 14:44.107
We haven't found
any new psychic photos here either.

14:55.361 --> 14:57.295
Wait a second.

15:03.669 --> 15:04.829
l wanna show you something.

15:15.781 --> 15:17.646
Right here. This.

15:19.818 --> 15:21.615
And look.

15:21.687 --> 15:26.488
lt's the same company. What if the kidnapper
was working construction at both sites?

15:26.558 --> 15:29.186
He would've been able
to pick out the two women.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.856
- Check it out. Let me know what you find.
- Where are you gonna be?

15:33.399 --> 15:37.733
Back in DC. l want Special Photo to run this.
l still think the answer's in here.

15:37.803 --> 15:40.704
What if it's not?
This woman's time is running out.

15:40.773 --> 15:45.870
All the more reason to fully investigate
the one hard piece of evidence we do have.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.936
l'll be in touch.

16:10.903 --> 16:14.168
Get away from me!
Get away from me, you bastard!

16:14.640 --> 16:16.574
Let me go...

16:34.593 --> 16:37.027
Can you get rid of the blurriness here?

16:37.096 --> 16:40.930
Yeah. l just need to mark a place
where the blur comes to a point

16:41.000 --> 16:43.434
and let the computer do its business.

16:46.205 --> 16:48.935
Bingo. Lord, look at that!

16:49.008 --> 16:52.239
- This guy's an artist.
- Why do you say that?

16:52.311 --> 16:53.972
However he did this,

16:54.046 --> 16:57.413
however he put this together, it's seamless.

16:58.884 --> 17:01.717
What about this face?
Can you bring that up?

17:01.787 --> 17:03.414
Wait a second. Let's try.

17:10.429 --> 17:13.364
- l think l can sweeten it more.
- OK, do that.

17:27.112 --> 17:27.976
What have you got?

17:28.446 --> 17:32.577
From the construction company employees,
18 workers overlapped on both job sites.

17:32.651 --> 17:35.882
- We're checking, but so far nothing.
- What about day laborers?

17:35.954 --> 17:39.617
Mr lskendarian there
doesn't hire workers off the books.

17:39.691 --> 17:41.283
l don't want lRS trouble.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.955
But his foreman might hire cash-only
day labor without his knowledge.

17:45.030 --> 17:47.794
He's got seven job sites going now,
as many foremen.

17:47.866 --> 17:52.030
Gather officers to canvass. Which foreman
works the Midlothian Corporate Park?

17:52.104 --> 17:55.130
- Thatjob's finished.
- Find out where he is today.

17:55.207 --> 17:56.868
l'll take that one.

17:56.942 --> 17:58.204
Can l use your phone?

17:59.478 --> 18:01.537
OK, thank you.

18:01.613 --> 18:04.480
NClC shows no match for that man.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.657
What about this shape up here?
What is that?

18:19.531 --> 18:22.989
Can you take that and flip it
so that that's on the bottom?

18:28.273 --> 18:30.366
ls that a shadow?

18:32.945 --> 18:35.379
Yeah. lt is.

18:36.248 --> 18:38.546
lt's somebody's shadow.

18:41.019 --> 18:45.183
lt's the kidnapper's shadow.
lt's like he's looming over her.

18:45.257 --> 18:48.192
lt's like he... he's standing over her.

18:48.260 --> 18:52.128
He means to pass judgment on her,
like a god.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.513
Hello?

19:18.924 --> 19:20.585
Hello?

19:35.040 --> 19:36.769
Hello?

19:50.022 --> 19:51.683
Hello?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.963
Hi. Can l help you?

20:04.736 --> 20:06.601
l hope so. Are you the foreman?

20:06.672 --> 20:11.132
- Yes, ma'am. l'm Gerry Schnauz.
- l'm Special Agent Dana Scully.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.805
l'd like to ask you some questions
about the day laborers you hire.

20:15.013 --> 20:18.847
- What, is this some lRS thing or...
- No, sir, not at all.

20:18.917 --> 20:22.250
My crew's at lunch
if you want to talk to anybody, but

20:22.321 --> 20:25.552
everybody l've got on today
is on the books, as far as l know.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.826
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Yeah, sure.

20:30.629 --> 20:33.598
- Scullly.
- l may have something for you

20:33.665 --> 20:35.929
on the kidnapper. lt's

20:36.001 --> 20:38.367
- something about his legs.
- Yeah?

20:38.437 --> 20:42.168
They're unusually long.
They're out of proportion.

20:42.241 --> 20:46.610
l'm thinking he's either very tall,
or he's not, but wants to be.

20:47.679 --> 20:49.670
Scully?

20:50.048 --> 20:52.209
Scully, are you there?

20:57.923 --> 20:59.220
Unruhe.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.350
Stand where you are!

21:15.741 --> 21:17.732
Don't move!

21:20.245 --> 21:22.873
Stop or l'll shoot!

21:44.036 --> 21:46.630
Lace your fingers behind your head.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.597
Do it!

22:25.277 --> 22:28.075
- Who?
- Alice Brandt.

22:29.348 --> 22:33.808
The second woman that you abducted.
That's her name, Gerry.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.050
Where is Alice Brandt?

22:37.956 --> 22:39.719
l don't...

22:39.958 --> 22:42.756
l have no earthly idea
what you're talking about.

22:43.428 --> 22:45.362
Tell us where she is, Gerry.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.330
l'm sorry.

22:47.399 --> 22:50.926
This is a case of mistaken identity
or something.

22:51.002 --> 22:53.061
l honestly,

22:53.138 --> 22:56.574
honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.042
Explain this.

23:02.748 --> 23:08.118
We're running Sheetrock. l use that to start
the holes in it to keyhole in all the fixtures.

23:08.186 --> 23:12.646
- No. You used this to kill the two men.
- What two men?

23:12.724 --> 23:15.284
You used this on Mary Lefante!

23:15.360 --> 23:19.729
Who? Wait.
A minute ago it was Alice Brandt.

23:19.965 --> 23:23.924
l don't believe this.
l do not believe this is happening.

23:24.002 --> 23:27.938
You want to tell us about the first time
you were arrested, Gerry?

23:28.006 --> 23:33.205
ln 1980 you attacked
your father with an ax handle.

23:34.112 --> 23:38.811
You beat him so severely that he spent
the remainder of his life in a wheelchair.

23:39.451 --> 23:42.614
l was notjailed. l was institutionalized.

23:42.687 --> 23:46.316
l had a kind of chemical imbalance.

23:48.660 --> 23:53.256
Yeah. ''Gerald Schnauz, treated
for a paranoid schizophrenic disorder.''

23:53.331 --> 23:57.233
''Six years in Melvoyne Psychiatric Hospital.
Released 1986.''

23:59.004 --> 24:02.132
So what you been up to since 1986, Gerry?

24:03.208 --> 24:05.608
Taking care of my father.

24:05.677 --> 24:09.238
Looking after him 24 hours a day.

24:10.916 --> 24:13.009
Making amends.

24:16.621 --> 24:20.216
He passed away in January.

24:20.659 --> 24:22.991
How did you feel about that?

24:24.696 --> 24:26.755
Sad.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.593
lt says here you have a sister.

24:32.404 --> 24:34.895
Where is your sister, Gerry?

24:34.973 --> 24:37.032
She passed.

24:37.108 --> 24:40.669
Actually, it says here
she committed suicide ln 1980.

24:41.713 --> 24:44.079
God, that was a bad year.

24:45.517 --> 24:48.179
What else happened ln 1980, Gerry?

24:48.253 --> 24:50.448
Well, John Lennon got shot.

24:51.723 --> 24:54.556
Where are you going with this?
Are you Sigmund Freud?

24:54.626 --> 24:59.495
- Why don't you cut the BS?
- Why don't we get back to Alice Brandt?

24:59.564 --> 25:01.828
Where is she?

25:10.542 --> 25:12.772
You look troubled.

25:17.115 --> 25:19.208
Hey, Gerry?

25:23.488 --> 25:25.456
This your father?

25:29.861 --> 25:34.321
- Where'd you get that?
- You left that for me. Left it like a fingerprint.

25:40.672 --> 25:44.267
ls this what you see
when you close your eyes, Gerry?

25:53.518 --> 25:55.349
ls that what you see?

25:59.691 --> 26:01.352
Gerry,

26:01.960 --> 26:04.485
tell me where Alice Brandt is.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.764
She's safe...

26:11.469 --> 26:13.835
from the howlers.

26:19.711 --> 26:22.202
She's all right now.

26:24.149 --> 26:28.142
Gerry, tell me how l can find her.

26:53.311 --> 26:55.302
Over here!

26:57.882 --> 27:00.009
Right up ahead.

27:45.363 --> 27:48.890
Scully, that word unruhe, unrest -
it's bothering me.

27:48.967 --> 27:52.835
Maybe he thought he was curing them.
Saving them from damnation.

27:53.171 --> 27:56.698
From those things in the pictures.
He called them ''the howlers.''

27:56.775 --> 27:58.106
lt's over, Mulder.

27:58.176 --> 28:01.577
Then that photo wouldn't be his fantasy.
lt would be his nightmare.

28:01.646 --> 28:04.206
What the hell does it matter?

28:04.916 --> 28:07.146
- Because l wanna know.
- l don't.

28:19.464 --> 28:21.329
OK, Gerry.

28:22.567 --> 28:25.468
Put it all in here. Wallet, jewelry, everything.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.083
Eyes straight ahead.

28:46.324 --> 28:48.554
Let's step over to the table.

29:02.941 --> 29:04.875
What the...?

29:25.930 --> 29:27.261
Mulder.

29:30.869 --> 29:33.963
This wound's in the wrong place.
He was shot in the throat.

29:34.038 --> 29:35.972
He wasn't trying to save this victim.

29:36.040 --> 29:41.205
We just got a report of a robbery at the
drugstore where the first victim disappeared.

29:51.089 --> 29:53.057
What happened?

30:10.008 --> 30:11.999
Thank you.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.912
lt was Gerry.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.244
He took the passport camera and all the film.

30:18.316 --> 30:22.275
And morphine, scopolamine
hydrobromide and insulin syringes.

30:22.353 --> 30:26.551
- He's making more Twilite Sleep.
- He wants to continue his work.

30:28.426 --> 30:32.021
You know thatjob site
that l arrested him at, Mulder?

30:32.096 --> 30:36.760
What if he's picked out his next victim?
There were apartment buildings on all sides.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.429
You think you interrupted his stalking?

30:40.004 --> 30:41.096
Let's go.

30:41.172 --> 30:46.200
Hold on a second. Bring the car around.
l just wanna wait for this. l'll be right there.

30:56.721 --> 31:00.623
- Corning.
- Corning. Send units to Belmont Avenue.

31:00.692 --> 31:04.856
Check all the apartments near thatjob site.
l think he's heading back there.

31:04.929 --> 31:06.954
- Got it.
- Thanks.

31:23.781 --> 31:25.442
Ow!

32:02.420 --> 32:03.978
Scully!

32:05.056 --> 32:05.954
Scully!

32:11.629 --> 32:12.891
Scully!

32:42.060 --> 32:43.220
Sir?

32:44.162 --> 32:48.690
Agent Scully's Explorerjust turned up at
a park and ride about 20 miles up the US 81.

32:48.766 --> 32:52.668
- Any sightings?
- A report of an Audi stolen from the same lot.

32:52.737 --> 32:56.503
He's switching cars.
He's gonna do that two or three times.

32:58.743 --> 33:01.143
He's got six fingers here.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.713
Sir?

33:03.948 --> 33:07.475
He's got six fingers.
What about his apartment?

33:07.552 --> 33:09.850
We got a unit there. But he ain't comin' back.

33:10.054 --> 33:13.649
What about friends, coworkers?
Does he have a summerhouse?

33:13.725 --> 33:15.659
He doesn't have much of anything.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.321
We're running some phone numbers
from his wallet...

33:18.396 --> 33:20.728
Let me see his wallet.

33:26.270 --> 33:29.034
lt's his father's obituary.

33:31.442 --> 33:35.401
''Recipient of the Bronze Star Medal
during the Korean War.''

33:35.480 --> 33:38.711
''Gerald Schnauz Sr, DDS.''

33:39.951 --> 33:42.146
He was a retired dentist.

34:22.592 --> 34:25.061
He was here.

34:26.030 --> 34:28.396
Why would he take the chair?

35:23.521 --> 35:25.512
Let me go.

35:34.599 --> 35:38.194
lt's over, Gerry. Let me go right now.

35:58.623 --> 36:02.559
Yes, you do.
Everybody does. But especially you.

36:02.627 --> 36:04.356
Why?

36:05.563 --> 36:07.622
Why me, Gerry?

36:07.698 --> 36:10.565
Do l remind you of your sister?

36:12.003 --> 36:17.305
Why did your sister kill herself, Gerry?
What did your father do to her?

36:17.375 --> 36:19.866
He didn't do anything. lt was the howlers.

36:19.944 --> 36:22.845
OK. Then let's talk about the howlers.

36:28.252 --> 36:33.121
They live inside your head. They make you
do things and say things that you don't mean.

36:33.524 --> 36:38.723
And all your good thoughts
can't wish them away. You need help.

36:39.330 --> 36:41.093
You've got them

36:41.866 --> 36:43.697
right there.

36:44.468 --> 36:45.901
Don't you feel them?

36:45.970 --> 36:48.734
- l don't have them, Gerry.
- See?

36:48.806 --> 36:54.438
They made you say thatjust now
because they know l'm going to kill them.

36:54.512 --> 36:59.245
What if you're wrong, Gerry?
What if there are no such things as howlers?

36:59.317 --> 37:01.877
What if you made them up inside your head

37:01.953 --> 37:05.821
to explain the things
your sister said your father did?

37:06.624 --> 37:11.061
Great. Now they got you talking
like Sigmund Freud.

37:11.128 --> 37:13.596
l am on to you!

37:13.664 --> 37:15.962
l know your tricks!

37:17.101 --> 37:20.036
Besides, l've seen them

37:20.104 --> 37:23.096
in that picture that your partner showed me.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.108
Pictures don't lie.

37:25.643 --> 37:28.077
You saw them too.

37:28.145 --> 37:31.512
lf there are such things as howlers, Gerry,...

37:33.417 --> 37:37.444
they live only inside your head.

38:33.277 --> 38:34.869
Six fingers, right?

38:34.945 --> 38:38.813
- We've got the state police...
- Why are there six?

38:39.350 --> 38:40.146
What?

38:40.217 --> 38:45.780
We've got the state police looking as far
south as Grand Rapids. Still no sign of her.

38:48.492 --> 38:51.052
- Agent Mulder, what do we do?
- Damn it.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.869
One, two...

39:01.939 --> 39:04.373
There's five headstones.

39:10.781 --> 39:13.011
And the father makes six. Come on!

39:13.084 --> 39:15.245
Let's go! Let's go!

39:33.404 --> 39:35.531
Fan out! Check the tree line!

40:04.168 --> 40:07.035
What does... What does this mean?

40:08.172 --> 40:10.640
lt means you need help, Gerry.

40:22.319 --> 40:27.279
No, l think what it means
is that l don't have much time left.

40:34.732 --> 40:37.064
No, Gerry, stop!

41:12.937 --> 41:14.199
Scully!

41:17.074 --> 41:18.473
Mulder!

41:18.542 --> 41:20.100
ln here!

41:20.177 --> 41:23.806
Mulder, help! Mulder!

41:25.749 --> 41:27.683
Scully!

41:38.329 --> 41:40.957
- Are you hurt?
- No.

41:44.001 --> 41:45.866
Get an ambulance!

42:35.986 --> 42:38.682
Addendum to case report.

42:39.757 --> 42:41.691
After his death,

42:41.759 --> 42:46.219
a diary was found among
Gerald Schnauz's belongings,

42:46.964 --> 42:53.665
written in the second person and apparently
intended as an open letter to his father.

42:53.737 --> 42:57.002
lt includes the names of his victims.

42:57.074 --> 42:59.542
The women he desired to save.

43:01.011 --> 43:05.277
My name is contained in the last entry.

43:09.253 --> 43:13.656
l have no further explanation
for the existence of the photographs,

43:13.724 --> 43:16.625
nor am l confident one is forthcoming.

43:20.397 --> 43:22.922
My captivity forced me to understand

43:23.000 --> 43:26.697
and even empathize with Gerry Schnauz.

43:26.937 --> 43:30.236
My survival depended on it.

43:33.978 --> 43:38.438
l see now the value of such insight.

43:38.515 --> 43:43.043
For truly to pursue monsters,
we must understand them,

43:44.955 --> 43:48.015
we must venture into their minds.

43:51.228 --> 43:54.595
Only, in doing so,

43:54.665 --> 43:58.601
do we risk letting them venture into ours?
