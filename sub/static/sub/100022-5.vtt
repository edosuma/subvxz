02:13.452 --> 02:15.410
DiNoto? The fuck outta here!

02:15.494 --> 02:18.285
No, I did. His parents
knew my parents.

Vincent right in the back.

of the dugout right at him.

02:28.035 --> 02:31.285

walk to first,

02:31.369 --> 02:35.661

don't even see it comin'.

Well, I got a boxer's fracture
on my pinky.

02:50.035 --> 02:51.875
Yeah, I had to sit out
the rest of the season.

02:51.911 --> 02:53.035
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

02:53.118 --> 02:54.494
He sat out the rest of the year?

02:54.577 --> 02:56.035

05:39.160 --> 05:40.619
His lungs are filling

05:41.202 --> 05:42.410
Pneumonia?

05:42.494 --> 05:44.118
Pneumocystis pneumonia,
specifically.

05:44.202 --> 05:46.911
It's the most common infection

05:46.993 --> 05:48.619
We see this a lot.

is severely impaired.

He's showing advanced symptoms
of dementia as well.

05:59.577 --> 06:02.577

that he lacks capacity.

06:03.702 --> 06:05.619
What do you mean?

06:05.702 --> 06:08.118
He can't make decisions
for himself anymore.

06:15.285 --> 06:16.525
It's time for him to come home.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.202

in a hospital.

06:18.285 --> 06:19.535

06:28.744 --> 06:29.869
I know what he wants.

06:29.952 --> 06:31.702
Then you need to tell
his family.

06:31.786 --> 06:34.661
He hasn't seen his family
since 1969.

06:35.410 --> 06:36.619
I'm sorry.

06:36.702 --> 06:39.035
Legally,
there's nothing I can do.

06:39.118 --> 06:41.535

in this condition.

06:41.619 --> 06:42.827

- Gene.

06:55.786 --> 06:56.827
Doc?

06:59.327 --> 07:01.786

in my office.

07:29.494 --> 07:31.619

07:49.577 --> 07:52.327
Shoulda kicked the shit out

07:52.410 --> 07:54.952
Well, maybe he was just
trying to make a point.

07:55.035 --> 07:57.452
Say what you will about Frankie;
he had principles.

07:59.410 --> 08:01.077
Well, tell me this, then.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.303
How in the hell was he feeding

08:02.327 --> 08:04.452
that robust gambling habit
of his?

08:04.535 --> 08:06.869
He was skimming off the peeps
that much?

08:06.952 --> 08:09.035
He was selling a little coke
on the side.

08:09.118 --> 08:11.744

would go there. You?

08:13.869 --> 08:15.786

08:37.744 --> 08:39.993
and see a white guy
bleeding out from his neck,

08:40.077 --> 08:41.494
a black guy hovering over him,

08:41.577 --> 08:44.327
and two naked ladies
screaming their asses off,

08:44.410 --> 08:46.035
in their heads,
they see an arrest.

08:46.118 --> 08:47.369

till we can go out again?

08:53.494 --> 08:56.452
- Hmm?
- All right. Listen.

08:57.118 --> 08:58.369
Guy's in a coma.

08:58.452 --> 09:00.952
Now, we're keepin' vigil, like,
18 hours a day.

09:01.035 --> 09:02.911
As long as we're there
when he wakes up,

09:02.993 --> 09:04.553
we'll make sure
he has his story straight

09:04.577 --> 09:05.993

Ah, I can see that.

11:09.535 --> 11:12.452
You had a good run.
Lotta good times, yeah?

11:14.702 --> 11:16.077
We'll get you another.

11:33.911 --> 11:36.369
That's for the Hi-Hat
and the parlors.

11:36.452 --> 11:37.993
Paul's been tied up.

11:38.077 --> 11:41.410
It's all right. I know
the kid's having a tough time.

11:44.993 --> 11:46.243
How you holding up?

11:47.077 --> 11:48.118
I'm fine.

11:49.118 --> 11:51.619
- You don't look it.
- Really?

11:52.744 --> 11:55.118
Some asshole just killed
my brother.

11:55.202 --> 11:57.786
Hey, we're gonna find out
who did it.

12:00.952 --> 12:02.035
What?

12:02.118 --> 12:03.494
You sayin' you don't know?

12:05.535 --> 12:09.118
- Excuse me?
- I mean, who are you kiddin'?

12:09.202 --> 12:13.369
You think I didn't see what was
going on between you two?

12:13.452 --> 12:16.619
The Show Land money,
the porno tapes.

12:16.702 --> 12:18.410
You were up in his face
over that shit

12:18.494 --> 12:20.494
three weeks ago right in here.

12:20.577 --> 12:22.077
You've hated him for years.

12:22.160 --> 12:25.327
If you got something to say
to me, say it.

12:25.410 --> 12:26.661
Think I just did.

12:27.535 --> 12:29.285
It's okay, Rudy, I get it.

12:29.369 --> 12:31.410
You know, just business.

12:31.494 --> 12:33.410
Right? Isn't that
what you people say?

12:33.494 --> 12:34.661
You people.

12:41.911 --> 12:43.160
Did you like this place?

12:43.243 --> 12:45.535
Did you like holding court
behind the bar

12:45.619 --> 12:47.369
and being king of the party?

12:47.452 --> 12:50.243
Having the money to buy
whatever car you want,

12:50.327 --> 12:53.952
whatever clothes you want,
whatever drugs you want?

12:54.035 --> 12:57.035
Being able to fuck whatever
woman walked through that door?

12:59.577 --> 13:01.369
I been nothin' but good to you.

13:01.452 --> 13:03.369
And you lay this shit
at my feet?

13:09.035 --> 13:10.702
You got your money.

13:10.786 --> 13:12.160
I'll see you next week.

13:12.911 --> 13:14.077
Get your head right!

13:21.786 --> 13:23.952
Where'd you get that thing?

13:24.035 --> 13:25.827
You...
You know who you look like?

13:25.911 --> 13:27.702
You look like Joan Collins.

13:29.952 --> 13:31.869
Uh... Hank got it for me.

13:31.952 --> 13:33.535
He's taking me to
the company picnic;

13:33.619 --> 13:35.911
I didn't have a lot
of outdoor stuff, so...

13:40.494 --> 13:42.118
So, did you read it?

13:42.202 --> 13:45.243
I, uh... I glanced at it.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.369
What'd you think?

13:49.744 --> 13:51.243
I think it's...

13:52.202 --> 13:53.786
like a short story.

13:55.410 --> 13:58.993
And... Well, I don't know
anybody at The New Yorker,

13:59.077 --> 14:02.202
so, you know... it's a pass.

14:05.744 --> 14:07.160
It's good stuff.

14:07.243 --> 14:08.744
It's not a script.

14:08.827 --> 14:10.803
It's paragraph after paragraph
of people walking around

14:10.827 --> 14:12.202
having feelings.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.261
It's mostly action lines.
There's not even any sex.

14:14.285 --> 14:17.952
Oh, there's sex, but you would
have to read it to get it.

14:18.035 --> 14:20.993
It's not an H.W. International
picture.

14:21.077 --> 14:23.619
I... It's not even
a Candy Renee Femme-Erotica.

14:23.702 --> 14:26.661
To be honest with you, I don't
know what the fuck it is.

14:26.744 --> 14:29.243
Okay, but I know this:
I can't do anything for you.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.243
Come on. You fuckin' serious?

14:32.786 --> 14:35.118
You're not even gonna help me
with distribution?

14:35.202 --> 14:36.535
You're shooting on film, right?

14:36.619 --> 14:38.202
Yes, of course,
I'm shooting on film.

14:38.285 --> 14:40.136
All right, so, you...
You have a quick day there,

14:40.160 --> 14:42.952
you... you need to put together
some short ends,

14:43.035 --> 14:44.993
you can keep the camera
for an hour or two,

14:45.077 --> 14:46.243
have a blast.

14:46.327 --> 14:47.369
That I can do.

14:47.452 --> 14:49.869
What a cheap shit you are.

14:49.952 --> 14:53.202
Well, why don't you ask
Richie Rich, huh?

14:53.285 --> 14:55.702
Have him ante up
a few hundred thousand dollars.

14:55.786 --> 14:57.118
I can make three features

14:57.202 --> 14:58.595
with what he probably
wipes his ass on.

14:58.619 --> 14:59.619
Don't go there.

14:59.702 --> 15:01.285
Ah, listen, I'm not judging you.

15:01.369 --> 15:02.762
- Okay? that's how...
- You are judging me!

15:02.786 --> 15:04.219
That's how a lot of people
get it done.

15:04.243 --> 15:05.523
Let me be clear about something.

15:05.577 --> 15:07.786
I am not fucking this guy
for his money.

15:07.869 --> 15:09.369
Well, I never said that.

15:09.452 --> 15:11.869
Is that really what you think
of me after all these years?

15:11.993 --> 15:13.913
Well, you sure as shit
had no problem treating me

15:13.993 --> 15:15.118
like a customer.

15:15.202 --> 15:16.452
Hmm?

15:16.535 --> 15:18.744
You have no problem asking me,
uh, for cash

15:18.827 --> 15:20.911
every time you get a wild hair
about...

15:20.993 --> 15:23.053
-You really are
a fucking asshole!
- some fucking project.

15:23.077 --> 15:25.118
No, you know what?
I'm not an asshole.

15:25.202 --> 15:27.494
I'm the dumbest john ever.

15:27.577 --> 15:30.077
Because with you,
all I get for my money

15:30.160 --> 15:32.202
is a bunch of fucking headaches!

15:32.285 --> 15:34.535
Fuck you! Really.

15:35.577 --> 15:37.118
Fuck you, Wasserman!

15:41.160 --> 15:42.952
I don't understand
why you can't be there.

15:43.035 --> 15:44.555
It's a turn-off
to the clientele, babe.

15:44.619 --> 15:46.345
Guys see me hanging around
in the back of the club,

15:46.369 --> 15:48.011
- they know you're not available.
- I'm not.

15:48.035 --> 15:50.243
Yeah...
Well, you know what I mean.

15:50.327 --> 15:51.827
You're there to feed
their fantasy.

15:51.911 --> 15:53.744
Kiki said the same thing
when she set this up.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.285
Okay, then hang out
in the hotel room

15:55.369 --> 15:57.118
- while I work.
- Look.

15:57.202 --> 16:00.035
I've got a lot of meetings
on the calendar this week. Okay?

16:00.993 --> 16:03.118
VCA, Caribbean, Caballero...

16:03.202 --> 16:04.842
Plus, I need time
to work on my own thing.

16:04.911 --> 16:07.327
I forgot. "Your own thing."

16:08.577 --> 16:09.993
You're gonna miss your flight.

16:16.911 --> 16:18.661
I'll see you next week.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.993
The white zone is
for the loading and unloading

16:21.077 --> 16:24.535
of passengers only.
No standing any time.

16:31.452 --> 16:34.702
- Holy shit.
- You got something rose-colored?

16:42.661 --> 16:45.202
Who was that dark-haired guy
at the Three-Six-Six,

16:45.285 --> 16:47.702
runnin' his mouth
the night Frankie got shot?

16:49.869 --> 16:51.702
Italos?

16:51.786 --> 16:53.952
- The Italian, yeah.
- Mm.

16:56.410 --> 16:57.911
His name is Pasquale.

16:59.535 --> 17:00.786
He got a last name?

17:01.410 --> 17:03.118
Cacace.

17:03.202 --> 17:04.868
All right.
What was he doing there?

17:04.952 --> 17:06.952
He bought his coke from Frankie.

17:07.035 --> 17:09.911
It came from me, pure.

17:09.992 --> 17:12.743
But Frankie stepped on
the product too many times.

17:12.827 --> 17:15.452
All right, where can I find him?
Pasquale?

17:15.535 --> 17:17.285
Talk to Tommy Longo.

17:18.868 --> 17:19.911
Why Tommy?

17:19.992 --> 17:22.077
Pasquale's father is Gambino.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.410
Tommy made the connect.

17:25.285 --> 17:27.577
That motherfucker
hasn't said shit to me.

17:28.869 --> 17:31.452
If Tommy can't help you
find Pasquale,

17:31.535 --> 17:33.993
look for the malaka's car.

17:34.077 --> 17:35.869
There's not many of them
on the street.

17:35.952 --> 17:37.786
You got a make and model?

17:37.869 --> 17:42.077
It's a Mustang, SVO,
turbocharged.

17:42.160 --> 17:47.285
Dark gray. Hood scoop
on the right. Double spoiler.

17:47.369 --> 17:48.827
How the fuck you know all that?

17:50.327 --> 17:51.786
Greek men love cars.

18:04.410 --> 18:06.160
I passed all my classes
and everything.

18:06.243 --> 18:08.118
All As and Bs.
But that didn't matter.

18:08.202 --> 18:09.827
Why, what happened?

18:09.911 --> 18:11.327
When you fill out
the application

18:11.410 --> 18:12.494
on the nurse's license,

18:12.577 --> 18:14.452
they ask if you have
a police record.

18:15.452 --> 18:17.202
I coulda lied about it, but...

18:17.285 --> 18:18.911
I didn't want to have to live
with a lie,

18:18.993 --> 18:21.410
always worried that somebody's
gonna find me out.

18:21.494 --> 18:23.410
I think you made
the right choice.

18:23.494 --> 18:25.160
Yeah, well, I got denied.

18:26.369 --> 18:28.494
It's against the policy
even if it's just

18:28.577 --> 18:30.702
misdemeanors for solicitation.

18:30.786 --> 18:33.410
They say it shows
my "moral character."

18:35.243 --> 18:37.160
It's like all that hard work
didn't matter

18:37.243 --> 18:39.160
because I made mistakes
when I was a kid.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.661
But you're fighting it?

18:41.744 --> 18:43.410
You're damn right
I'm fighting it.

18:43.494 --> 18:45.775
I talked to some of those
free-of-charge lawyers they got,

18:45.827 --> 18:47.410
and they helped me
get a hearing.

18:50.077 --> 18:52.243
I was thinking...

18:52.327 --> 18:55.869
maybe if you could come
talk about how you know me...

18:55.952 --> 18:57.410
Of course.

18:58.285 --> 19:00.118
Just tell me where to go.

19:00.202 --> 19:01.869

31:41.118 --> 31:44.952
she had sex with men for money
who did not know her,

31:45.035 --> 31:48.369
and made money for men
who did not respect her.

31:48.452 --> 31:51.619
And yes, she was picked up
by the police many times.

31:53.452 --> 31:56.118
But she also earned her GED...

31:56.202 --> 31:57.827
and went to night school,

31:57.911 --> 32:00.952
and got a job in retail
selling clothes.

32:01.035 --> 32:03.744
When I first met her,
she had a book in her hand:

32:03.827 --> 32:05.369
A Tale of Two Cities.

35:03.993 --> 35:05.577

35:07.494 --> 35:09.035
Okay. Um...

35:10.243 --> 35:11.869

35:13.327 --> 35:15.786

this money for now?

35:16.786 --> 35:18.160

35:26.744 --> 35:28.845
and if I can get my own
eight-color press and a dryer,

35:28.869 --> 35:30.243
mine'll look way better.

35:30.327 --> 35:33.327
So, where are you gonna keep
your dryer and your...

35:33.410 --> 35:35.410
- eight... color press?
- Color press.

35:35.494 --> 35:37.452

200 a month.

35:39.535 --> 35:42.118

to get me up and running.

35:42.202 --> 35:43.744

you gotta...

35:43.827 --> 35:45.327

35:58.369 --> 36:00.369
What I think you need to do...

36:00.452 --> 36:03.952

36:04.035 --> 36:05.494

some confidence.

36:07.869 --> 36:09.369

a bunch of girls
I used to know from the street.

54:28.494 --> 54:31.535
There were so many good stories.

54:31.619 --> 54:34.035
Like, crazy stories!

54:34.118 --> 54:38.285
Funny stories.

54:39.827 --> 54:43.369
Scary ones, sometimes.
And I wanted to, um...

55:16.494 --> 55:17.869
Fuck. You know...

55:21.327 --> 55:25.786

in New York.

One of the things that she said
really inspired the storyline,

01:01:32.243 --> 01:01:35.160
as AIDS patients' health
began to deteriorate.
