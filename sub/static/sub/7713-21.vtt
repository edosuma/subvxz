and l am back

00:20.270 --> 00:21.646
in the form of
a new company,

00:21.730 --> 00:24.148
the Michael Scott
Paper Company.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.825
Okay.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.410
Not going to make this one.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.084
Love the hair.

00:46.463 --> 00:47.964
Morning, Michael.
MlCHAEL: Hello.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.551
They took away
my parking space,

00:51.635 --> 00:53.344
but they can't
take away my pride.

00:55.681 --> 00:56.973
(GRUNTS)

01:00.060 --> 01:03.980
l would like to invite
you all to come along
with me on a journey.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.198
Welcome

01:15.200 --> 01:17.785
to the Michael Scott

(CLANGS)

01:26.754 --> 01:28.171
(lNAUDlBLE)

01:54.990 --> 01:58.743
So, l thought we could
take the customer list

01:58.952 --> 02:00.203
and. . .

02:01.705 --> 02:03.247
And we could. . .

02:03.707 --> 02:05.792
You realize
you're not actually
talking to me, right?

02:05.876 --> 02:06.918
And. . .

02:07.002 --> 02:08.461
Hey, Kelly.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.506
Yes, Charles,
you wanted me.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.883
Oh. No, l meant
that Kelly.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.594
The new receptionist
is also named Kelly.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.430
So Kelly Kapoor has decided
to hover around my desk

02:19.556 --> 02:21.140
so that she can run
into Charles' office

02:21.225 --> 02:22.600
every time
he calls for Kelly.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.645
She thinks that if she says
"You wanted me" enough,

02:25.729 --> 02:27.563
he will, in fact,
want her.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.316
lt's not the worst plan
she's ever had.

02:30.734 --> 02:31.818
Oh, and Kelly. . .

02:31.902 --> 02:34.362
Yes, Charles,
yes, you wanted me.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.657
Okay, l'm going
to call you Kapoor,

02:37.741 --> 02:39.408
okay, and you Hammond.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.870
lf we're changing names,
can l be Erin?
lt's my middle name.

02:42.955 --> 02:45.039
Erin? Okay,
that's very pretty.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.207
Thanks.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.333
Well, you know what
my middle name is?

02:47.417 --> 02:50.127
Rajnigandha. And l hate it.
l hate it!

02:52.923 --> 02:55.299
l thought Rajnigandha
was a boy's name.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.471

03:04.268 --> 03:06.435
We are in the heart of it.

03:06.937 --> 03:11.858
And the surge of water
carries our business
out to the sea.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.192
What should we do now?

03:14.152 --> 03:18.030
We wait and hope
that people show up
to the pancake luncheon.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.866
l don't know. l think
l have done absolutely

03:19.950 --> 03:22.285
everything you can do
to prepare for the day.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.370
l've updated
our contacts,

03:24.454 --> 03:26.455
l have gotten quotes
from suppliers,

03:27.207 --> 03:29.000
l have sent out an Evite

03:29.084 --> 03:31.836
for our big grand opening
pancake Iuncheon.

Six yeses, one maybe,
only 1 1 nos.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.719
And 788 not-yet-replieds,

03:39.803 --> 03:43.472
but of that group,
782 have viewed it.

03:45.601 --> 03:49.562
l'm going to need
800 of these

03:50.105 --> 03:52.231
on nice bright paper.

03:52.316 --> 03:55.484
lt is a coupon
for unparalleled
customer service.

04:03.118 --> 04:06.662
l make that one copy
and l become the girl
who makes copies.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.957
And by the end of the day,
l'm receptionist again.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.793
And the worst part is
l like making copies.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.838
The paper comes out
all warm and stuff.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.175
And it's cold in there,
because it's technically
a closet.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.017
What do you think?

04:28.101 --> 04:29.310
Let me check.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.064
No! Clearly a hunter,

04:33.190 --> 04:35.942

an outfit together.
Thank you.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.361

l used to hate him,
hate him, hate him,
hate him.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.328
I studied him
to figure out why
I hated him so much.

04:47.913 --> 04:52.375
But that blossomed into
a very real friendship,
as these things often do.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.503
You should come in town
this weekend, man. Yeah.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.213
We'll hang out
Scranton-style.
Hey.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.048
You said you
were going to be out

a seven here in Scranton.

Sure.
Yeah?

She was a prostitute.

06:02.446 --> 06:04.363
Why was she
in this building?

06:04.448 --> 06:06.991
This whole place
used to be a brothel.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.909
There was a tavern
on the ground floor.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.370
That's crazy.
Yeah, isn't it?

06:11.705 --> 06:14.457
She was bludgeoned to death
by the business end
of a riding crop.

good at something?

Because the thing
you're saying l'm good at

button a bunch of times.

one's better than the other.

like one of those is better
than the other.

rushed into your penis.

with other people
in this office.

And l think l have come up
with the reason why.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.718
This office space
is too small.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.344
Definitely.
Okay.

10:37.429 --> 10:41.307
There are four corners
in this room.

10:41.641 --> 10:45.936
Each corner is to be
a personal space
for each one of you.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.189
Whichever corner you want,
and make it your own.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.482
We could work from home.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.443
Or you could fire
one of us.

less education.

Okay, guys,
thank you for the offers,

10:56.239 --> 10:58.115
but l want you to get pumped
about this corner idea.

10:58.199 --> 11:01.493
All right, one, two, three,
what are we going to do?

11:02.329 --> 11:03.871
Corner idea.
No, you're supposed to say,

11:03.955 --> 11:05.372
"Rock the house."
Rock the house.

11:05.457 --> 11:06.582
How would we know that?

11:06.958 --> 11:10.294
Hey, dude, do you know
what a rundown is?

11:11.755 --> 11:13.088
Use it in a sentence.

Can you get this
rundown for me?

be really good.

sounds like the rundown
is really important.

to do this rundown
of all my clients.

ask him what it. . .

was crazy.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.987
Jojo? Yeah.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.865
He did a doughnut
in the parking lot
in front of a cop.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.408
Then he yells, "Hey, cop,
you like doughnuts?"
