10:28.236 --> 10:29.498
Let's look there!

10:30.804 --> 10:35.983
Teddy! Teddy!
Where are you?

10:36.113 --> 10:38.289
Hmm. Keep looking,
everyone.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.425
[gasps]
Teddy loves coming here!

10:43.555 --> 10:46.297
Look! Here's the first
slide we ever slid.

10:46.428 --> 10:49.083
Wow. That's
pretty tall.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.824
Yeah. Teddy was
scared at first,

10:50.954 --> 10:52.608
but I held his hand.

10:52.739 --> 10:56.351
I guess I'll have to ride it
on my own from now on.

10:56.481 --> 10:59.571
Not today. Let's all go
down the slide together.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.965
Come on!Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!

11:05.795 --> 11:07.318
Whoo-hoo!Yeah!

11:07.449 --> 11:08.972
[laughing]

11:09.103 --> 11:11.409
Whoa!
[laughing]

11:11.540 --> 11:15.849
Oh! Whoa! Ah!
I almost lost my hat.

11:15.979 --> 11:18.373
Doesn't look like
Teddy's at the playground.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.114
Where next, Junior?

11:20.244 --> 11:21.637
Hmm...

11:21.768 --> 11:22.899
Remember,
we have to go

11:23.030 --> 11:25.685
exactly where you've
been with Teddy.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.382
Um...
[gasps]

11:27.512 --> 11:29.863
We played pirates.
This way!

11:29.993 --> 11:33.736
Oh! Junior never just
walks anywhere, does he?

11:35.912 --> 11:36.870
Uhh!

11:39.568 --> 11:41.091
Avast, ye matey!

11:41.222 --> 11:44.181
We're looking for Teddy
of the High Seas.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.705
Aye-aye, Captain Sunny.

11:45.835 --> 11:50.971
Aye! And other things
pirates say. Arrggh!

11:51.101 --> 11:53.843
Now let's go find
First Mate Teddy!

11:57.238 --> 11:59.370
Teddy!

11:59.501 --> 12:01.459
Oh. Aha! Oh.

12:01.590 --> 12:04.158
Teddy!

12:15.691 --> 12:17.780
Teddy?
Is that you?

12:17.911 --> 12:21.044
Here, doggy, doggy!
[gasps]

12:23.743 --> 12:24.744
Aah!

12:24.874 --> 12:26.397
Three bears!

12:26.528 --> 12:28.617
[laughing]

12:28.748 --> 12:31.446
Your bear hair
is really good.

12:31.576 --> 12:35.624
Maybe a little too good.
Poor Scratch.
Aah!

12:35.755 --> 12:38.758
Bears!

12:40.150 --> 12:41.978
Whenever Teddy and I
play pirates,

12:42.109 --> 12:43.763
we cross the stream
right here.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.416
That's what we did
this morning.

12:45.547 --> 12:49.246
Of course! And at the
muddiest, squishiest part!

12:49.377 --> 12:53.642
All right.
I'll do it for Junior.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.908
Blair,
what are you doing?

12:59.039 --> 13:00.344
Crossing the stream.

13:00.475 --> 13:01.824
We're supposed to do
everything

13:01.955 --> 13:05.132
exactly like Junior
and Teddy did, right?

13:05.262 --> 13:08.265
Um, we used the stones.

13:08.396 --> 13:09.963
[grunting]

13:10.093 --> 13:12.313
Whoa.
[grunts]

13:12.443 --> 13:14.271
Here, let me help you.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.665
Uhh!
[sighs]

13:16.796 --> 13:19.407
Oh! Usually when
I soak my feet,

13:19.537 --> 13:21.148
it's for a pedicure.

13:24.716 --> 13:29.156
And that's the story
of how I met Sunny.

13:29.286 --> 13:31.288
I know, right?

13:31.419 --> 13:33.029
It's a lot to take in.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.075
Hey, are you
gonna eat that?

13:37.338 --> 13:38.208
Thanks!

13:38.339 --> 13:41.298
[chomping]

13:41.429 --> 13:43.648
I feel like I can
tell you anything,

13:43.779 --> 13:45.215
Sir Bearlington.

13:45.346 --> 13:46.434
Mmm! Aw!

13:46.564 --> 13:48.262
I can't wait
to tell Sunny

13:48.392 --> 13:51.091
how glad I am
she got you for me.

13:53.528 --> 13:54.877
Arrggh!Arrggh!

13:55.008 --> 13:56.661
Arrggh!Arrggh!

13:56.792 --> 13:58.750
Huh?What's wrong, Junior?

13:58.881 --> 14:00.535
I never go any
farther than this.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.015
Why?

14:02.145 --> 14:06.802
Teddy thinks it's too
dark in those bushes.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.978
Then let's start looking
someplace else.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.632
There is no place else.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.895
We didn't go
anywhere else today.

14:13.026 --> 14:16.638
I've just got to face it.
Teddy's gone for good.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.814
Oh!

14:18.945 --> 14:22.383
Don't be sad, Junior.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.124
I'm sure gonna miss him.

14:24.254 --> 14:25.647
[sighs]

14:25.777 --> 14:29.651
Junior, what made Teddy
so special to you?

really thought about it.

I know it's not Teddy,

15:39.416 --> 15:42.332
but this guy
love adventures too.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.682
I'm sure he wants to
hear your stories

15:44.813 --> 15:46.771

really use a friend.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.599
Think you could

15:50.384 --> 15:52.212

My hat!

Aah!

15:59.088 --> 15:59.959
[groaning]

16:00.089 --> 16:01.525
I can't reach.

16:01.656 --> 16:02.700
[groans]

16:02.831 --> 16:05.442
The best hat
in the world

16:05.573 --> 16:08.968
and I didn't even get to
wear it for the whole day.

16:09.098 --> 16:11.274
Oh! First Teddy
disappears

16:11.405 --> 16:13.015
and now you lose
your hat.

16:13.146 --> 16:16.845
This day is
a complete disaster.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.328
[straining]

16:21.458 --> 16:22.807
It's no use!

16:22.938 --> 16:24.679
[straining]

16:24.809 --> 16:27.160
If only my arms
were longer.

16:27.290 --> 16:28.813
Or the bushes
were shorter.

16:28.944 --> 16:32.426
Maybe I can help.
Some ribbon,

16:32.556 --> 16:34.515
a hair clip...

16:36.778 --> 16:39.128
Done.
Uhh!

16:40.651 --> 16:43.263
[groans]

16:43.393 --> 16:47.571
I only have to
get it right once.

16:47.702 --> 16:50.096
I bet I can fit
through those bushes.

16:50.226 --> 16:53.360
Ooh. It's awfully
dark in there.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.101
I know you're not Teddy,

16:55.231 --> 16:58.060
but do you want to come
with me?

16:59.757 --> 17:01.107
[sighs]

17:01.237 --> 17:02.630
There has to be
some other way

17:02.760 --> 17:03.892
to get your hat
out of there.

17:04.023 --> 17:08.114
There is!
The Junior way!

17:11.421 --> 17:13.641
Junior, be careful![Junior straining]

17:13.771 --> 17:16.078
I love my hat,
but I love you more!

17:16.209 --> 17:20.169
[Junior straining]

17:20.300 --> 17:22.911
Junior, are you okay?

17:23.042 --> 17:25.348
[Junior straining]

17:25.479 --> 17:27.611
Arrggh!

17:27.742 --> 17:29.570
We got it!

17:29.700 --> 17:32.268
Yay!
Good job!
Way to go!

17:32.399 --> 17:34.749
Thanks, Junior.

17:34.879 --> 17:37.578
You looked so sad,
like how I felt

17:37.708 --> 17:38.840
when I lost Teddy.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.842
You tried to help me
get him back,

17:40.972 --> 17:42.713
so I wanted to help you.

17:42.844 --> 17:44.150
So did Roarfang.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.803
Who's Roarfang?

17:45.934 --> 17:48.284
My new toy
that Sunny made me.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.895
Oh! Does that mean
you're keeping him?

17:51.026 --> 17:53.594
You bet!
He's not afraid of the dark

17:53.724 --> 17:56.075
and his arms are great
at holding onto things.

17:56.205 --> 17:59.687
Well, thank you
and Roarfang

17:59.817 --> 18:01.689
for getting my hat.

18:01.819 --> 18:04.692
I'll still miss Teddy
and I'll never forget him,

18:04.822 --> 18:07.956
but now I have Roarfang
to go on adventures with.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.653
I think Teddy
would like that.

18:09.784 --> 18:10.959
Sorry to interrupt,

18:11.090 --> 18:12.830
but does this mean
we can go home?

18:12.961 --> 18:16.791
'Cause my shoes are
still super-squishy.

18:16.921 --> 18:17.922
[giggling]

18:18.053 --> 18:19.620
Sure! Race you there!

18:19.750 --> 18:22.013
Ah! I knew
he'd say that.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.624
[laughter]

18:24.929 --> 18:26.844
Doodle, we're back!

18:26.975 --> 18:29.717
Sunny! Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

18:29.847 --> 18:30.935
[laughing]
You're welcome,

18:31.066 --> 18:32.676
you're welcome,
you're welcome!

18:32.807 --> 18:34.548
Uh, for what?

18:34.678 --> 18:35.810
For my new buddy,

18:35.940 --> 18:38.421
furry friend,
and dance partner!

18:47.952 --> 18:49.780
Huh? That's not
Sir Bearlington.

18:51.608 --> 18:55.438

Hey, buddy!
Huh?

18:55.569 --> 18:56.744
[laughing]

18:56.874 --> 18:59.007
Wait.
He was here

18:59.138 --> 19:01.879
in the salon
the whole time?

19:02.010 --> 19:05.231
Still, we got cool
hairstyles out of it.

19:05.361 --> 19:08.059
[laughing]

19:08.190 --> 19:10.410
Where did you find
Junior's bear, Doodle?

19:10.540 --> 19:11.715
Junior's bear?

19:11.846 --> 19:13.891
[laughing]

19:14.022 --> 19:17.068
You mean...?
[sighs] Oh!

19:17.199 --> 19:19.070
He was in one of
the new supply boxes.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.899
I thought he was
a present for me.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.336
Guess that means
I'll have to

19:23.466 --> 19:25.686
cancel our picnic
tomorrow, huh?

19:25.816 --> 19:28.079
No, Doodle.
It's okay.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.343
You can keep him.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.432
[gasps]
Really?

19:32.562 --> 19:33.911
Yeah. Really?

19:34.042 --> 19:36.349
Uh-huh. I can
tell you love him

19:36.479 --> 19:37.872
as much as I do.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.090
Don't worry, Teddy.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.962
I'll still come
and visit.

19:41.092 --> 19:42.181
But now,
you and Doodle

19:42.311 --> 19:43.704
can take care
of each other.
