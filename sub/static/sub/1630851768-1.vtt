<i>Sometimes decisions
are made out of desperation.</i>

00:33.308 --> 00:38.413
<i>Sometimes those decisions
can destroy your life.</i>

06:35.537 --> 06:36.537
<i>Hello?</i>

06:37.873 --> 06:39.574
- Hi.
- <i>Hi, Ruby.</i>

06:41.110 --> 06:43.478
- Hi, Karen.
- <i>What's wrong?</i>

06:47.116 --> 06:51.187
- Is... is daddy there?
- <i>He's right behind you.</i>

08:16.038 --> 08:18.908
<i>There's no place
in the world you're more vulnerable</i>

08:18.941 --> 08:21.077
<i>than your bedroom at night.</i>

08:21.110 --> 08:23.746
<i>As Ruby's step-aunt,
Lydia, learns,</i>

08:23.779 --> 08:28.350
<i>it's a hard thing to shake when you
feel as though you're being watched.</i>

08:35.124 --> 08:36.392
I got popcorn.

08:36.425 --> 08:39.261
Yeah. I see that... everywhere.

08:41.297 --> 08:42.932
It's that healthy shit you buy.

08:44.233 --> 08:46.836
It's pretty dry
but I kind of like it.

08:49.438 --> 08:51.841
Smoked a fat blunt
a little bit ago.

08:51.874 --> 08:53.943
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

08:53.976 --> 08:56.145
- Yeah. I found it on the sidewalk.
- Kurt.

08:56.178 --> 08:57.980
It's fine.
It was in a ziploc bag.

08:58.013 --> 09:00.015
Oh my god, you're an idiot.

09:00.049 --> 09:03.786
- I'm so, so sexy.
- Yeah. You have your moments.

09:03.819 --> 09:05.921
This is not one of them.

09:28.477 --> 09:31.714
- You worked late.
- I know.

09:31.747 --> 09:33.182
I was so tired.

09:37.219 --> 09:39.355
Come get next to me.

09:39.388 --> 09:42.358
Okay. Move over.

09:42.391 --> 09:45.427
Please. Popcorn.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.869
Oh my god, you didn't
even brush your teeth.

11:02.838 --> 11:05.374
- You're not going to work today?
- Hmm?

11:05.407 --> 11:08.110
- What time is it?
- Relax. It's Saturday.

11:08.143 --> 11:11.046
Oh. Oh, you fucker.

11:12.848 --> 11:16.352
Oh, we're having a serious morning.

11:16.385 --> 11:18.520
You okay?

11:18.554 --> 11:20.556
You look exhausted.

11:20.590 --> 11:24.159
- Thank you.
- No, I think you're hot all cranky and tired.

11:28.330 --> 11:31.867
Mm. I didn't sleep
at all last night.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.869
I know. I slept like a baby.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.505
Yeah. I know.

11:36.538 --> 11:38.907
I don't know.

11:38.941 --> 11:40.209
I felt scared.

11:43.178 --> 11:44.313
No, I mean...

11:44.346 --> 11:46.315
No, what do you mean?

11:46.348 --> 11:49.885
Uh, it's just
bad dreams I think.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.988
You always make me
watch those fucked up movies.

11:53.022 --> 11:56.368
- You have to know what's out there in the real world.
- Oh, yeah, an alien hillbilly

11:56.392 --> 11:59.128
cannibal rapists are
what I could be faced with?

11:59.161 --> 12:01.130
They're always
looking for their next meal.

12:02.364 --> 12:04.400
Thank you for keeping me safe.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.568
I'll always protect you.
I'm your husband.

12:10.539 --> 12:13.142
- I'm gonna go get in the shower.
- Okay.

12:13.175 --> 12:14.310
Goodnight.

12:25.487 --> 12:26.822
Where are you, Kurt?

12:51.113 --> 12:55.084
<i>Lydia!
It's awesome here, Craig's got a keg.</i>

12:55.117 --> 12:58.354
- <i>Hey, that rhymes.</i>
- You're with Craig and Beth still?

12:58.387 --> 12:59.922
<i>Yeah, is that okay?</i>

12:59.955 --> 13:02.124
I thought you were
just going for one.

13:02.157 --> 13:04.526
<i>- I was, but lyd they got in...
- Hi, Lydia!</i>

13:04.560 --> 13:07.329
- Hi, Beth. Can you just come home?
- <i>Do I have to?</i>

13:07.363 --> 13:10.432
Kurt, please?

13:10.466 --> 13:14.536
<i>Okay, fine.
I'll be home in an hour.</i>

13:16.004 --> 13:17.940
- <i>Beth is so much cooler than you.</i>
- I know.

13:19.975 --> 13:21.977
- <i>Love you.</i>
- Love you too.

13:29.518 --> 13:31.320
That's a long hour.

14:39.221 --> 14:41.089
Where the fuck were you?

14:41.123 --> 14:44.159
Sorry, I had to finish my game.

14:44.193 --> 14:46.128
Fuck.

14:46.161 --> 14:50.399
- Relax, Jesus.
- Oh my god, you're such a fucking dick.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.061
Come on, you idiot.

15:26.636 --> 15:28.170
Why are you so mad?

15:28.203 --> 15:30.673
You said
you would be home in an hour.

15:30.707 --> 15:33.676
- You were so late.
- So? I was at Craig's.

15:33.710 --> 15:36.345
That's never been
a problem before.

15:36.378 --> 15:39.448
I was... I was scared.

15:39.481 --> 15:42.284
- Okay?
- Scared?

15:42.317 --> 15:43.385
Of what?

15:44.687 --> 15:46.789
I don't want to say.

15:46.823 --> 15:49.124
What?

15:49.157 --> 15:51.093
We drinking tonight?

15:51.126 --> 15:53.228
No.

15:53.262 --> 15:54.263
I wish.

15:56.599 --> 15:58.166
You wanna fool around then?

15:59.434 --> 16:00.434
It's like...

16:02.571 --> 16:06.108
- It's like 2:30.
- So?

16:06.141 --> 16:07.242
I'm tired.

16:08.477 --> 16:09.679
Please.

16:11.313 --> 16:12.347
Fine.

16:13.883 --> 16:16.819
Oh, god.

16:16.853 --> 16:18.520
You're so annoying.

16:38.307 --> 16:40.843
Sweet. I'm marked for abduction.

16:42.712 --> 16:43.712
What?

16:56.893 --> 16:57.893
Cool.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.777
- <i>Lyd?</i>
- Hi.

17:14.811 --> 17:17.546
<i>Hi. What time are you
coming tonight?</i>

17:17.580 --> 17:22.852
Uh, Kurt gets off work at 6:30
so we'll be there around eight.

17:22.885 --> 17:24.921
<i>Okay? Are we getting drunk?</i>

17:24.954 --> 17:27.189
<i>I really need you to say yes.</i>

17:27.222 --> 17:31.493
Uh, normally I would say no,
but I think I need to.

17:31.526 --> 17:35.263
- <i>Yes. Are you okay?</i>
- Yeah, no, I'm fine, Charlotte.

17:35.297 --> 17:38.533
I'm excited to celebrate
your birthday.

17:38.567 --> 17:42.905
<i>Yes, that's right! Okay, see you
tonight, wear something slutty.</i>

17:42.939 --> 17:45.307
I'm too old for slutty.

17:45.340 --> 17:46.809
<i>Ugh. Okay, grandma.</i>

17:46.843 --> 17:48.510
<i>Okay, I gotta go.
I'll see you soon, poon.</i>

17:48.543 --> 17:50.545
Okay, bye-bye.

17:50.580 --> 17:52.147
Bye.

19:01.050 --> 19:02.885
I thought you were gonna lose.

19:02.919 --> 19:05.387
I never miss!

19:05.420 --> 19:07.289
Right.

19:07.322 --> 19:09.524
Hey, what did you think
of Charlotte's new husband?

19:09.558 --> 19:12.427
Hmm...

19:12.461 --> 19:15.430
They didn't waste any time
getting married.

19:15.464 --> 19:17.299
He's old.

19:17.332 --> 19:18.801
Yeah, he's really old.

19:18.835 --> 19:20.703
- She can do better.
- Yeah.

19:22.571 --> 19:26.042
You want a beer?

19:26.075 --> 19:30.312
No, I want Tequila.

19:32.081 --> 19:36.284
Coming right up, sweet sugar.

19:36.318 --> 19:39.387
Candy... candy tits.

19:41.023 --> 19:44.627
Hey, if I had as much money
as Charlotte's new husband...

19:46.796 --> 19:48.631
Would you let me
do the ass thing to you?

19:48.664 --> 19:50.767
No, not even then.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.467
- Prude.
- Oh!

20:44.821 --> 20:46.856
Tequila!

20:48.490 --> 20:50.325
Fuck, you scared
the shit out of me.

20:54.831 --> 20:56.666
You gotta tell me
what's going on right now,

20:56.699 --> 20:59.367
because you have been acting
so fucking weird lately.

21:01.536 --> 21:03.538
- I can't.
- What do you mean you can't?

21:03.572 --> 21:05.842
- Are you...
- God.

21:05.875 --> 21:09.411
- Are you cheating on me?
- No, god, no.

21:09.444 --> 21:11.513
Then why
are you acting so sketchy?

21:13.616 --> 21:15.084
You're making me paranoid.

21:15.117 --> 21:16.551
Oh, fuck.

21:18.688 --> 21:20.890
Okay. Oh.

21:20.923 --> 21:23.059
I really didn't want to.

21:23.092 --> 21:27.063
I'm... I'm afraid
that will make it real.

21:27.096 --> 21:29.866
Doesn't really seem to do anything
if I pretend like it's not real.

21:29.899 --> 21:31.566
Real? What real?

21:33.202 --> 21:34.469
Frank.

21:37.073 --> 21:39.876
- Frank?
- I call it frank.

21:39.909 --> 21:42.678
When I was little,
if a movie scared me,

21:42.712 --> 21:44.881
I would always name
the monster or ghost

21:44.914 --> 21:49.085
like, you know, a regular name so
it wouldn't seem scary anymore.

21:49.118 --> 21:50.152
Okay.

21:51.621 --> 21:53.656
That makes sense.

21:55.591 --> 21:57.026
Hey. Hey. Hey.

22:03.799 --> 22:05.034
It's okay.

22:14.777 --> 22:19.181
So... so you're
scared of a monster?

22:19.215 --> 22:21.784
- No. No.
- What? Like a movie? Because I don't remember it.

22:21.817 --> 22:24.820
No. So...

22:24.854 --> 22:28.758
At night sometimes,
it feels like more lately.

22:28.791 --> 22:36.232
I wake up and... and I see
something standing in our room.

22:36.265 --> 22:39.969
Sometimes it's like
I can't even move.

22:40.002 --> 22:43.706
- Like I'm paralyzed.
- Like sleep paralysis.

22:43.739 --> 22:45.808
I saw this fucked up
doc on that.

22:45.841 --> 22:48.678
Lyd, you prob...

22:48.711 --> 22:50.980
You're probably
just having bad dreams.

22:51.013 --> 22:53.548
I'm sorry. I'll chill
with the weird movies.

22:53.582 --> 22:55.751
No, it's not that, I'm awake.

22:57.119 --> 22:59.588
It feels like
it wants to hurt us.

22:59.622 --> 23:02.091
I've just been too afraid
to tell you or say anything

23:02.124 --> 23:04.559
- because then it will be real.
- You're safe.

23:06.963 --> 23:11.067
Hey... you probably
just need more sleep.

23:11.100 --> 23:13.002
Both of us had too
much to drink tonight.

23:13.035 --> 23:16.238
- No, it's not that!
- Hey, nothing... here.

23:18.107 --> 23:22.845
Nothing is going to happen to you
when you're right next to me, okay?

23:39.862 --> 23:43.232
Hey, do you think that frank can
see us when we're having sex?

23:43.265 --> 23:44.566
Shut up.

23:46.235 --> 23:50.039
No. Have you asked him how old he is?
Because he's seen some pretty dirty stuff.

23:50.072 --> 23:54.844
That's not fucking funny, Kurt.
I shouldn't have said anything.

23:54.877 --> 23:57.013
- I'm kidding. Don't be mad.
- I'm sleeping.

24:25.808 --> 24:26.976
I see it.

24:53.969 --> 24:57.873
<i>Some people say
Charlotte got what she deserved.</i>

24:57.907 --> 25:01.243
<i>She had no sympathy for
her step-daughter, Ruby's death.</i>

25:01.277 --> 25:05.848
<i>And the only person she seemed
to truly care for was herself.</i>

25:05.881 --> 25:08.617
<i>But when you're alone
in your new big house</i>

25:08.651 --> 25:11.720
<i>late at night
and the power is gone,</i>

25:11.754 --> 25:15.758
<i>sadly, you can't even
see what's coming for you.</i>

25:15.791 --> 25:20.029
<i>But then again,
maybe that's a good thing.</i>

25:29.305 --> 25:31.073
There we go!

25:39.215 --> 25:40.215
Okay.

25:51.894 --> 25:53.195
Ah!

25:53.229 --> 25:54.997
I'm so glad
we can finally do this!

25:55.030 --> 25:57.867
- Me too.
- You look super cute.

25:57.900 --> 26:00.669
- Oh, you look great as always.
- I know, right?

26:00.703 --> 26:04.240
It's new, don't you just love.

26:04.273 --> 26:08.244
Ah. Oh, I've never heard
of this brand of wine.

26:08.277 --> 26:11.814
- Oh, well, it's nothing special but...
- Oh, you didn't have to do that.

26:11.847 --> 26:14.183
We have the most
amazing wine cellar.

26:14.216 --> 26:17.386
So, um, we'll just drink this one
after we're already drunk then!

26:17.419 --> 26:20.890
Yeah, totally. Totally.

26:20.923 --> 26:23.092
- Come in.
- Oh, yeah.

26:26.962 --> 26:30.099
Wow. Your home is beautiful.

26:30.132 --> 26:31.734
I know, right?

26:31.767 --> 26:33.278
My husband had the house
before we got married

26:33.302 --> 26:36.172
but the interior
design is all me.

26:36.205 --> 26:38.107
It looks great.

26:38.140 --> 26:40.176
Yeah. If you ever need
any help with design stuff,

26:40.209 --> 26:42.044
it's... it's my passion.

26:42.077 --> 26:43.779
Oh, thanks.

26:45.080 --> 26:47.283
I have been dying
to have you over.

26:47.316 --> 26:49.785
We have been in that pilates
class for months now,

26:49.818 --> 26:52.988
and I keep telling myself,
Charlotte, that girl is cool.

26:53.022 --> 26:55.224
You need to make some friends in here.

26:55.257 --> 26:59.728
Yeah, totally.
I'm glad we got to hang.

26:59.762 --> 27:02.231
- How long have you been living here?
- Oh, only six months.

27:02.264 --> 27:06.068
My husband and I got
married quick, so, he's older.

27:07.403 --> 27:13.142
But, yeah, I would have had you over
sooner but we're having some family shit.

27:13.175 --> 27:17.413
So, uh, my step-daughter
has been a nightmare lately.

27:17.446 --> 27:19.014
Um, so stressful.

27:19.048 --> 27:21.317
That must be
a big adjustment for you.

27:21.350 --> 27:24.887
Mm. That's an understatement.

27:26.155 --> 27:28.524
- Are they here now?
- Oh, god no.

27:28.557 --> 27:31.460
No. They took some
daddy/daughter trip to a cabin

27:31.493 --> 27:34.129
that he used to go to when his
older daughter was alive.

27:34.163 --> 27:39.134
- Oh, that's so sad. What happened to her?
- Suicide.

27:39.168 --> 27:41.537
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

27:41.570 --> 27:45.007
Mm-hmm. Some hikers
found her hanging from a tree

27:45.040 --> 27:47.443
in bloodlane forest.

27:47.476 --> 27:49.278
- Yeah.
- Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

27:49.311 --> 27:53.215
I know, thanks. It's made
everything so stressful for me.

27:53.249 --> 27:57.987
Like, the little one,
Karen, is such a mess now.

27:58.020 --> 28:01.824
It's making life way more
difficult than it has to be.

28:01.857 --> 28:04.260
I just really needed
this quiet girl time.

28:04.293 --> 28:09.531
Oh, I'm sure this must be a
really difficult time for them.

28:09.565 --> 28:13.235
I mean, yeah, I guess.
Ruby was basically my age.

28:13.269 --> 28:15.204
They had different moms
or whatever.

28:15.237 --> 28:19.541
I'm wife number four for Tom,
his lucky number four we say.

28:19.575 --> 28:22.544
He loves that.

28:24.413 --> 28:27.049
Anyway, this has been
all consuming

28:27.082 --> 28:30.419
and I don't want to talk about
them or any more bullshit anymore.

28:30.452 --> 28:36.392
- So tell me about you.
- Uh, well, there's really not that much to tell.

28:36.425 --> 28:39.561
Um, I work as a receptionist
at a dentist office.

28:39.596 --> 28:42.898
- Mm!
- And, um, I'm taking this really awesome

28:42.931 --> 28:46.101
writing class at night. So
I've really been enjoying that.

28:46.135 --> 28:48.337
No kids.

28:48.370 --> 28:52.241
Oh, no.
I have a cat named Louisiana.

28:52.274 --> 28:55.244
Louie for short. That's
where I'm from originally.

28:55.277 --> 28:57.379
Lucky.
Well, where are you living now?

28:57.413 --> 29:00.983
- I have an apartment right near the pilates studio.
- Oh, that's okay.

29:02.251 --> 29:04.153
Yeah. Thanks.

29:04.186 --> 29:07.122
Any special man in your life?

29:07.156 --> 29:10.092
- No, I'm single, but still looking.
- Ah!

29:10.125 --> 29:13.429
You shut up!
How are you still single?

29:13.462 --> 29:15.898
You're so cool.

29:15.931 --> 29:19.468
Okay, we're gonna go out,
we're gonna get dressed up super hot.

29:19.501 --> 29:23.272
You can borrow something of mine.
And I am going to be your wing woman.

29:23.305 --> 29:26.141
I mean, look around.
I'm telling you I never miss.

29:26.175 --> 29:30.279
I believe that. I'm just not
really a bar person.

29:31.547 --> 29:34.550
Well, how else are you
going to meet someone?

29:34.584 --> 29:37.620
I mean, this is
real fucking life, Lacey.

29:37.654 --> 29:39.988
Okay, listen to me.

29:40.022 --> 29:42.925
There is no such
thing as the perfect man. Okay?

29:42.958 --> 29:45.327
You just find one
that gets you close enough

29:45.361 --> 29:49.331
and buys you some nice shit and
gives you some companionship.

29:49.365 --> 29:55.404
Okay? My sister, Lydia, married for
love, and it is a fucking nightmare.

29:55.437 --> 29:57.005
Okay, he is such a loser.

29:57.039 --> 29:58.416
She's like this hot,
successful lawyer,

29:58.440 --> 29:59.975
she could get anyone she wants.

30:00.008 --> 30:02.277
And he, like, works at a brewery

30:02.311 --> 30:06.315
- and makes a third of what she does.
- Are they happy?

30:06.348 --> 30:08.550
I don't know. Who cares?

30:08.585 --> 30:11.954
I mean, she... she, like,
set the bar like so low.

30:11.987 --> 30:14.490
Oh my god.

30:14.523 --> 30:17.426
I guess I'm just hoping
that the fairy tale is real.

30:17.459 --> 30:19.361
Oh my god, that's cute.

30:19.395 --> 30:21.397
Well, it isn't, but that's cute.

30:21.430 --> 30:23.600
That's sweet. I love that.

30:23.633 --> 30:25.968
Oh.

30:26.001 --> 30:28.638
Oh my god, snacks.

30:28.671 --> 30:31.608
- Huh?
- I made healthy snacks.

30:31.641 --> 30:36.512
You have to try my hummus.
It is practically world famous.

30:36.545 --> 30:39.515
- Oh.
- Okay, let's get... oh, there we go.

30:39.548 --> 30:41.984
- Here. Yeah.
- Mm. Mm.

30:43.653 --> 30:47.322
Right in the hole.

30:47.356 --> 30:49.491
Well?

30:49.525 --> 30:50.459
Delish.

30:50.492 --> 30:54.997
Right? Oh!

30:55.030 --> 30:58.500
- Mm!
- I'm on a diet so I... I'm just watching my figure.

30:58.534 --> 31:02.237
- Mm. Boo.
- Mm.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.275
Oh my god.

31:06.308 --> 31:08.444
Oh, shit!

31:08.477 --> 31:11.480
Party time!

31:11.513 --> 31:13.683
- Just leave it.
- Okay.

31:15.150 --> 31:18.353
Oh my... oh my god, I just
had the best idea for you.

31:18.387 --> 31:20.255
- Oh my god.
- What?

31:20.289 --> 31:23.459
Okay, so, I'm not always into
like this, like...

31:23.492 --> 31:29.732
Um, like, hippy dippy stuff, but I'm sure
you can tell that I'm a very spiritual person.

31:29.766 --> 31:34.704
So, there's, like, this guy who basically
helps you manifest your dream, man.

31:34.737 --> 31:37.139
You, like, go to him
and tell him like your goals

31:37.172 --> 31:39.241
and qualities
that you're looking for.

31:39.274 --> 31:43.145
And, like, apparently
he's a miracle worker,

31:43.178 --> 31:46.616
he helped my friend,
Lexi, land such a catch.

31:46.649 --> 31:49.485
And I was going to go to him
myself but I didn't need to,

31:49.518 --> 31:54.757
because then Tom came along and, like,
I knew that I hit the jackpot.

31:54.791 --> 31:56.693
I was lucky
not to need the help.

31:58.527 --> 32:01.296
Tom has more money than god.

32:03.232 --> 32:04.801
Nice.

32:04.834 --> 32:07.469
Okay, hang on, I'm gonna text
you this life coach guru,

32:07.503 --> 32:09.672
whatever's contact,
just so you have it.

32:09.706 --> 32:12.709
Um, I don't even know what to call
him, he's like literally magic.

32:12.742 --> 32:14.620
- I don't know if I really...
- Just so you have it,

32:14.644 --> 32:17.546
you know, I don't want you
to die alone.

32:19.381 --> 32:22.585
What? Oh my god, I was kidding.

32:24.319 --> 32:26.689
- Do you think it's a breaker?
- I don't fucking know.

32:26.723 --> 32:30.425
Who knows? This house is so off.
What the fuck?

32:30.459 --> 32:32.629
I'm so sorry,
this is such a lame hang.

32:32.662 --> 32:34.640
- It's getting pretty late anyway.
- Oh, you know what?

32:34.664 --> 32:36.766
- I got candles.
- I'm getting pretty tired.

32:36.799 --> 32:39.636
So, um, do you need help
with anything before I go?

32:39.669 --> 32:41.403
No, girl, I'm good.

32:41.436 --> 32:43.740
Plus the maid's here
tomorrow, so fuck it.

32:43.773 --> 32:45.642
Okay, well, cool.

32:45.675 --> 32:49.211
Jesus Christ.

32:49.244 --> 32:51.513
The fuck is that?

32:51.547 --> 32:53.583
Oh, here we go. Okay,
come on, I'll walk you out.

32:56.418 --> 33:00.422
Oh, that's weird. I swear
I locked that when you came in.

33:00.455 --> 33:05.127
- That's creepy. Are you sure you're okay here alone?
- Oh, totally, girl.

33:05.160 --> 33:08.831
Yeah. That's so sweet of you to ask
though, but I'm a strong woman.

33:08.865 --> 33:10.767
Not afraid of the dark.

33:10.800 --> 33:15.504
Okay, well, this was fun.

33:15.537 --> 33:18.240
Yeah!
Okay. Well, you call that guy.

33:18.273 --> 33:20.142
Let's find you your dream man.

33:20.175 --> 33:23.412
- Yeah. Okay.
- I'm serious. I'll see you Saturday.

33:23.445 --> 33:25.147
- What?
- In class.

33:25.180 --> 33:26.783
- Oh, right, Saturday.
- Okay.

33:26.816 --> 33:29.686
Bye! Jesus Christ.

33:29.719 --> 33:32.287
The fuck is up with this power?

33:42.164 --> 33:44.499
What the fuck?

33:44.533 --> 33:45.735
Fucking cat.

33:47.536 --> 33:48.536
Fuck.

34:01.618 --> 34:03.552
Oh, god.

34:03.586 --> 34:05.387
Jeez.

34:12.227 --> 34:14.664
Oh, fuck. Fucking cat.

34:14.697 --> 34:16.131
Goddammit.

34:22.337 --> 34:25.474
Ruby... is that you?

34:28.978 --> 34:30.379
Hello?

34:35.718 --> 34:38.286
Okay. Fuck this.

34:56.238 --> 34:59.307
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

34:59.341 --> 35:01.376
I promise I won't skin you.

35:21.764 --> 35:23.231
Okay.

35:23.265 --> 35:24.433
Fuck you, cat.

35:24.466 --> 35:25.702
I'm going to bed.

35:34.376 --> 35:36.378
Okay.
You're officially an idiot.

35:36.411 --> 35:38.246
Go the fuck to bed.

35:42.350 --> 35:45.220
That's fine. That's fine.

36:27.329 --> 36:29.599
Shit.

36:39.474 --> 36:41.476
Okay.

36:41.510 --> 36:43.613
No! Oh my god. Okay.

38:03.726 --> 38:06.896
<i>True love
can come in many forms.</i>

38:06.929 --> 38:12.735
<i>Ruby's cousin, Mary,
had been searching for it all of her life.</i>

38:12.768 --> 38:17.106
<i>Even though she was lonely, she knew
the right one was out there somewhere.</i>

38:17.139 --> 38:20.442
<i>Just waiting for her.</i>

38:20.475 --> 38:23.813
<i>She always wanted
a fairy tale ending.</i>

38:23.846 --> 38:26.782
<i>But Mary had forgotten...</i>

38:26.816 --> 38:33.388
<i>Some fairy tales are the darkest
and most twisted stories of them all.</i>

38:39.762 --> 38:40.762
Good night.

38:43.933 --> 38:45.768
I miss you every minute.

39:17.166 --> 39:19.735
9:15.

39:56.939 --> 39:58.140
Oh, shit.

40:10.786 --> 40:13.856
Hello. Hi, nice to see you.
Nice to see you.

40:17.093 --> 40:20.596
Hi. Good to see you back.

40:20.629 --> 40:21.974
I don't think
we've officially met.

40:21.998 --> 40:24.200
I'm Pearl.

40:24.233 --> 40:25.901
I'm Mary Lane.

40:27.703 --> 40:30.840
Sorry, did you say
your last name was lame?

40:30.873 --> 40:33.075
Oh, no.

40:35.244 --> 40:37.713
It's Lane. Lane.

40:37.747 --> 40:39.782
Oh, sorry, my bad.

40:39.815 --> 40:41.584
Well, today is gonna be good.

40:41.617 --> 40:44.020
A lot of expression
in those movements, okay?

40:44.053 --> 40:46.288
I want to feel
what's inside of you.

40:46.322 --> 40:48.591
You're deep, Mary, I can tell.

40:50.192 --> 40:54.163
- Okay.
- Okay, now let's get started.

40:54.196 --> 40:57.066
I want you to take form
down on the ground.

41:00.169 --> 41:01.303
What are you?

41:02.972 --> 41:07.643
Now, close your eyes
and in your new form, jump!

41:09.111 --> 41:13.282
That's right. That's beautiful.
Now let's jump again, dig deeper!

41:13.315 --> 41:17.920
Yes! All right, now let's
get into the choreography.

41:17.953 --> 41:19.221
Uh...

41:19.255 --> 41:21.757
Five, six, seven, eight.

41:21.791 --> 41:25.828
One and two.
Three and four. Five and six.

41:25.861 --> 41:28.931
Breathe. Seven, eight. Nice.

41:28.964 --> 41:31.934
Okay, so, the next few weeks
we've come to the end

41:31.967 --> 41:37.706
of series one of movement, and I have an
extra assignment I think you all will enjoy.

41:37.740 --> 41:40.843
I want you to write down
the lyrics of the song

41:40.876 --> 41:46.082
that plays within you and within
your intentions of the movement.

41:46.115 --> 41:48.317
And we'll share them
at the final class.

41:48.350 --> 41:50.219
I can't wait to hear them.

42:01.163 --> 42:02.264
Stupid...

42:03.866 --> 42:07.303
- Sorry, sorry.
- Oh shit, yeah, I didn't see you.

42:07.336 --> 42:09.905
It's okay.

42:09.939 --> 42:12.875
We're gonna have
a hell of a night, I guess.

42:12.908 --> 42:14.777
We are?

42:14.810 --> 42:16.912
Yeah, because of
all that homework.

42:18.714 --> 42:22.384
- Writing lyrics and stuff.
- Right. Yeah, totally.

42:24.753 --> 42:29.692
- I'm brax.
- I know because I've seen you in class.

42:31.127 --> 42:36.031
- Yeah, i'm, um, Mary.
- Yeah, I know too, I guess,

42:36.065 --> 42:39.201
because they said your name out,
like, in class and stuff.

42:40.970 --> 42:42.905
- Yeah.
- Lane not lame.

42:42.938 --> 42:47.409
Yeah... totally.

42:47.443 --> 42:50.746
- I'll see you next week.
- Yeah, can't wait.

42:50.779 --> 42:55.951
I mean, the class, it's gonna be
a fun class and stuff.

42:55.985 --> 42:59.221
Yeah, um, cool.

42:59.255 --> 43:00.389
Okay.

43:01.924 --> 43:03.092
So stupid.

43:16.071 --> 43:18.073
Hey, boo.

43:18.107 --> 43:19.107
Guess what?

43:20.376 --> 43:22.411
I'm the biggest loser ever.

43:23.979 --> 43:27.416
That's why I'll never have
a boyfriend in my entire life.

43:27.449 --> 43:29.185
What's that?

43:29.218 --> 43:30.819
You don't give a shit
because you're dead

43:30.853 --> 43:32.154
and you're still my only friend?

43:33.422 --> 43:35.925
Great, yep. Thanks.

43:53.375 --> 43:55.744
Barbara...

43:55.778 --> 43:59.381
You can't just walk into my house,
we talked about this, remember?

43:59.415 --> 44:03.252
- Try to lock the door, then.
- No, that's not how it works.

44:03.285 --> 44:05.754
Some of your mail
came to my place again.

44:05.788 --> 44:10.492
- Your mom was gonna keep it and use it for crafts.
- Oh, okay, thanks.

44:12.795 --> 44:14.096
You're going out tonight?

44:14.129 --> 44:15.264
No.

44:17.266 --> 44:19.468
I had a long the day
and I'm really tired, so...

44:21.337 --> 44:24.907
I wish I could go out
but my mom is always up my ass.

44:24.940 --> 44:30.279
If she wasn't, I'd totally go to
a bar and bring some hot guy home

44:30.312 --> 44:34.250
and be down for whatever.

44:36.051 --> 44:39.154
- Why don't you ever bring guys home?
- I do, some.

44:39.188 --> 44:42.157
No, you don't,
I'm always watching.

44:42.191 --> 44:44.893
Okay, I'm going to bed, Barbara.

44:44.927 --> 44:47.863
You don't go to bed until after
<i>wheel of fortune</i> at 8:30.

44:47.896 --> 44:49.965
Okay, stop watching me.

44:52.368 --> 44:55.404
You know, if you don't use it,
it can close up.

44:55.437 --> 44:57.940
It's not going to close up.

44:57.973 --> 44:59.008
You should check.

44:59.041 --> 45:00.109
I'm not going to check.

45:02.311 --> 45:04.947
My cousin Leo
is looking for a girlfriend.

45:04.980 --> 45:07.349
I can always introduce you.

45:07.383 --> 45:10.352
He's starting to be a guy now
because he wants to see chicks naked.

45:10.386 --> 45:12.354
I'm good.

45:13.623 --> 45:15.391
I feel bad for you.

45:15.424 --> 45:16.424
Don't.

45:25.635 --> 45:27.303
This is gonna
sound stupid, but...

45:29.338 --> 45:32.308
I'm thinking about calling
this love coach guru guy,

45:32.341 --> 45:35.311
uncle Tom's new wife,
Charlotte, told me about.

45:35.344 --> 45:37.813
I don't know, I was...
She said that...

45:39.381 --> 45:43.952
He helped her find her friend,
like the love of her life or something.

45:43.986 --> 45:45.588
She's always going off about it.

45:48.290 --> 45:51.360
I don't know.
It's probably stupid. Stupid.

45:53.529 --> 45:57.366
No, you should call him.

45:57.399 --> 45:59.435
It was probably
your last chance.

46:02.071 --> 46:06.108
Okay, well... good night.

46:06.141 --> 46:07.509
I'm serious.

46:07.543 --> 46:09.945
I won't leave until
you promise to call him.

46:11.213 --> 46:13.182
You make me so sad.

46:13.215 --> 46:14.216
Okay.

46:16.686 --> 46:19.355
Okay. Okay,
I'll call him right now.

46:19.388 --> 46:21.957
Okay, you promise?

46:21.990 --> 46:25.027
Yes... I'll do it right now.

46:25.060 --> 46:28.030
Okay. I'll know if you don't.

46:29.632 --> 46:30.866
Okay, good night.

46:33.636 --> 46:36.105
Good night.

46:36.138 --> 46:39.074
- Bye.
- Bye.

46:39.108 --> 46:40.108
Bye, boo.

46:59.561 --> 47:01.130
Just do it. Okay.

47:02.364 --> 47:03.999
No.

47:06.101 --> 47:08.137
Just do it.

47:08.170 --> 47:09.238
I'm going to do it.

47:28.357 --> 47:31.260
Uh, hi, um...

47:31.293 --> 47:36.298
My name's Mary, uh,
I got your number from my aunt.

47:36.331 --> 47:40.369
I mean, my friend Charlotte,
she said you helped their friend, Lexi.

47:40.402 --> 47:44.573
She said you were like a love
coach miracle worker?

47:44.607 --> 47:47.209
Oh, you did? How did you know?

47:47.242 --> 47:49.178
Um...

47:49.211 --> 47:50.211
Uh...

47:51.413 --> 47:53.482
What... what do I...

47:53.515 --> 47:57.052
Yeah, I guess... I guess
you could say I'm open minded.

47:57.085 --> 47:58.520
What do I want?

47:59.789 --> 48:01.990
Oh...

48:02.024 --> 48:03.492
I want to be in love.

48:04.794 --> 48:07.029
I mean, that's... that's
what we all want, isn't it?

48:07.062 --> 48:09.131
I mean, maybe it doesn't,
I don't know.

48:12.167 --> 48:14.436
Uh, I've been single now for...

48:15.705 --> 48:17.539
God, like ten years.

48:19.308 --> 48:22.377
I mean, god, I didn't even
realize it'd been that long.

48:24.313 --> 48:27.216
Um, I live in the valley.

48:28.785 --> 48:31.053
What? Right now, like tonight?

48:33.656 --> 48:38.193
Yeah.
Okay. I'll text you my address.

48:38.227 --> 48:42.297
Hey. Okay. Okay.
Thanks. Well, hey, are you...

48:42.331 --> 48:43.365
Yeah, okay, he hung up.

48:48.638 --> 48:50.272
Oh my god.

48:55.110 --> 48:56.411
I'm actually sweating.

49:00.382 --> 49:02.551
- Hi.
- Mary.

49:02.585 --> 49:03.786
I'm very glad you called.

49:17.099 --> 49:22.772
Okay. The vibe I'm feeling from
you is crippling loneliness.

49:22.805 --> 49:23.805
Thanks.

49:25.407 --> 49:27.175
You called just in time.

49:27.209 --> 49:28.477
I mean, something's gotta give.

49:29.846 --> 49:31.413
- I...
- Tell me this.

49:34.449 --> 49:38.287
Have you ever manifested from
your imagination even as a child?

49:38.320 --> 49:39.521
Not sure what you mean.

49:39.555 --> 49:41.223
I mean, um...

49:42.759 --> 49:45.460
Like an imaginary friend
that you were convinced was real

49:45.494 --> 49:50.332
or a plant or a bike
or a toy that you believed

49:50.365 --> 49:53.435
- had feelings.
- I was a pretty shy and lonely kid.

49:53.468 --> 49:55.638
Shocking.

49:55.672 --> 49:58.373
Well, there was this giant tree
I used to sit under

49:58.407 --> 50:03.378
for hours when I was little,
and then one day my dad hung up a swing

50:03.412 --> 50:08.216
to surprise me and I totally freaked
out thinking that he was hurting it.

50:08.250 --> 50:11.420
- Did you ever talk to this tree?
- Sometimes.

50:11.453 --> 50:12.855
Perfect! Perfect.

50:12.889 --> 50:15.792
Okay, Mary, come here.
Mary, come here.

50:17.259 --> 50:21.698
- You created love with this tree.
- I guess.

50:23.633 --> 50:25.100
Okay, now, look at me.

50:26.836 --> 50:28.771
Now, look away. Now, look at me.

50:30.572 --> 50:33.610
Now, look away, look at me.

50:33.643 --> 50:35.243
Look at me.

50:36.913 --> 50:40.515
What I'm gonna ask you to do is going to
push you way outside of your comfort zone.

50:40.549 --> 50:44.453
You're gonna have to commit and
trust me in this process completely.

50:44.486 --> 50:47.556
Okay, I've done this successfully
many times before, Mary.

50:47.590 --> 50:50.593
But only those that were
willing to give 100%

50:50.627 --> 50:53.362
truly thrived from the process.

50:53.395 --> 50:54.840
What do...
What do I have to commit to?

50:54.864 --> 50:56.899
Will you give it
your commitment?

50:56.933 --> 50:59.669
- Um...
- Do I have your commitment?

50:59.702 --> 51:01.638
Yes or no?

51:01.671 --> 51:03.740
I don't know. I... no!

51:03.773 --> 51:07.309
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Just sit, you have it.

51:11.648 --> 51:12.849
Now, follow me here.

51:15.550 --> 51:17.319
I want you
to make up your dream man.

51:19.254 --> 51:20.823
- You like men, right?
- Oh, yes.

51:20.857 --> 51:22.725
Okay, so make them up.

51:23.993 --> 51:26.228
Give him a name.

51:26.261 --> 51:28.698
What does he look like?
How does he feel?

51:30.499 --> 51:31.659
What does he look like naked?

51:34.436 --> 51:38.641
Have inside jokes.
Know where he's coming from.

51:38.675 --> 51:42.845
Know what he loves,
what makes him angry or jealous.

51:42.879 --> 51:46.448
Manifest him
and believe that he's real.

51:48.785 --> 51:51.563
I know what you're thinking. You're
thinking, "terrible. Why would I do this?

51:51.587 --> 51:53.555
I want a real man."

51:53.589 --> 51:55.357
And of course
that's the goal, Mary.

51:56.592 --> 52:00.462
But people like you, they...
They ooze desperation and uncertainty.

52:00.495 --> 52:02.564
It scares relationships away.

52:02.598 --> 52:04.433
But...

52:04.466 --> 52:07.302
If you are
completely convinced

52:07.335 --> 52:12.541
within yourself, that you were in a deep,
meaningful and satisfying relationship,

52:12.574 --> 52:14.744
then suddenly all those
insecurities disappear

52:14.777 --> 52:19.916
and you open yourself up for
something real to come in to find you

52:19.949 --> 52:25.822
and desire you. Mary, i'm... I'm telling
you this is going to set you free.

52:25.855 --> 52:28.423
It's gonna put you on
a fast track to real love.

52:32.662 --> 52:35.965
Maybe I'm crazy
but that actually makes sense.

52:35.998 --> 52:39.534
Of course it does.
I take cash or check.

52:40.770 --> 52:44.674
I... ooh, I... I don't even...

52:44.707 --> 52:46.441
I don't even know
what I owe you.

52:46.475 --> 52:49.846
- I have...
- What do you owe me?

52:49.879 --> 52:50.947
Everything.

52:52.414 --> 52:56.451
But 200 is fine. That'll do.
I'm going to check back in in two weeks.

52:57.754 --> 52:58.755
Okay.

53:29.118 --> 53:30.987
Hey.

53:31.020 --> 53:32.822
Jeffrey.

53:39.996 --> 53:42.965
Today it was a fun day.

53:46.002 --> 53:49.972
You look really good
in that red shirt.

53:51.607 --> 53:52.775
Stupid.

53:59.081 --> 54:00.415
Okay, well...

54:02.151 --> 54:04.020
I'm gonna go to bed, so...

54:05.621 --> 54:07.489
Do you want to come, or?

54:10.059 --> 54:11.761
Okay, well,
don't stay up too late.

54:56.538 --> 54:58.007
Hi, babe.

54:59.642 --> 55:00.643
How was your day?

55:02.612 --> 55:05.513
Okay, well, let me tell you
what happened to me.

55:05.547 --> 55:09.051
I'm still in shock, kind of,
because it's...

55:09.085 --> 55:11.821
Do you remember my uncle, Tom,
and his new wife, Charlotte?

55:11.854 --> 55:15.591
Yeah, that's the one. I...
It's just, he called me on the drive home

55:15.625 --> 55:18.127
and something
kind of strange happened.

55:18.160 --> 55:20.428
She's gone missing.

55:20.462 --> 55:23.866
Yeah. Well, yeah.

55:23.900 --> 55:27.169
Well, he and my cousin, Karen,
were like on vacation

55:27.203 --> 55:31.107
and then when they got back to the
house, there was like blood all over

55:31.140 --> 55:33.676
the place and the cat
was covered in it.

55:33.709 --> 55:36.478
I know!

55:36.511 --> 55:40.716
Yeah. And no Charlotte.

55:40.750 --> 55:43.753
It's so scary.

55:43.786 --> 55:44.787
Oh...

55:47.023 --> 55:51.060
God. I know.
I feel so bad for my uncle.

55:51.093 --> 55:54.597
It's just, he's been through
so much with Ruby dying.

55:54.630 --> 55:56.799
And now this, it's like...

55:58.901 --> 56:01.103
Yeah, I know.

56:01.137 --> 56:04.607
She was a pretty terrible person

56:04.640 --> 56:09.078
but she didn't deserve to have
something awful happened to her.

56:09.111 --> 56:10.780
I know she was a nightmare.

56:10.813 --> 56:14.250
Just. I know,
but she brought us together.

56:14.283 --> 56:15.651
I know.

56:17.552 --> 56:18.587
You too.

56:20.256 --> 56:21.757
Yeah, I know.

56:23.192 --> 56:24.660
Yeah, maybe you're right.

56:24.694 --> 56:27.229
Maybe she's just
went away on vacation.

56:27.263 --> 56:30.599
She was a pretty
unpredictable person.

56:30.633 --> 56:32.735
Yeah.

56:32.768 --> 56:35.037
Yeah. I know.
They got married so fast.

56:35.071 --> 56:39.608
It's... oh. Stop.

56:42.678 --> 56:44.246
Yeah.

56:44.280 --> 56:46.548
Okay. You're right.

56:46.582 --> 56:47.984
I'll stay positive for them.

56:50.552 --> 56:51.587
Thanks.

56:53.122 --> 56:56.926
Hey, do you want
to cook dinner together? Okay.

56:56.959 --> 57:00.196
But I have to warn you, I only
know how to cook hot dogs.

57:00.229 --> 57:03.899
It's kind of... they are? Okay.

57:03.933 --> 57:07.036
They're mine too,
it's just so meant to be.

57:07.069 --> 57:09.038
It's... I...

57:09.071 --> 57:11.539
What?

57:11.573 --> 57:15.011
Fine. You can watch me
all you want, handsome.

57:22.585 --> 57:26.822
I'm not gonna lie, I'm getting
pretty buzzed.

57:34.096 --> 57:36.132
You are?

57:36.165 --> 57:39.534
I am pretty excited
to see you drunk.

57:45.274 --> 57:47.676
Are we ready for that?

57:49.945 --> 57:51.647
I don't know. I mean...

57:53.149 --> 57:57.053
It's... it's been a long time
since I've been with someone.

57:58.320 --> 58:00.555
Uh... god.

58:02.358 --> 58:04.894
You know I mean sex, right?

58:08.964 --> 58:13.836
Um... high school.

58:13.869 --> 58:14.937
Yeah.

58:16.205 --> 58:18.274
You're just my only
real boyfriend I guess.

58:19.875 --> 58:24.080
I don't know. I mean, I've been out
on some dates and stuff since, but...

58:25.848 --> 58:28.684
I never really met anyone
that I connected with.

58:30.719 --> 58:32.188
I know it's kind of weird.

58:35.191 --> 58:37.927
We were in band together.

58:37.960 --> 58:39.095
Stop.

58:43.199 --> 58:47.369
Oh, don't be jealous.

58:47.403 --> 58:48.838
No.

58:48.871 --> 58:52.908
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

58:54.710 --> 58:57.413
You're gorgeous.

58:57.446 --> 59:00.716
And you're all
I'm thinking about.

59:02.818 --> 59:04.787
Okay.

59:07.189 --> 59:09.091
Okay, well, hurry back.

59:09.125 --> 59:11.026
Okay.

59:12.695 --> 59:13.863
You're so...

59:16.799 --> 59:18.934
Okay.

59:18.968 --> 59:21.437
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

59:21.470 --> 59:23.239
Okay. This is what you wanted.

59:23.272 --> 59:25.174
This is what you wanted.

59:25.207 --> 59:26.942
Oh my god, you have to commit.

59:29.745 --> 59:31.714
You have to commit.

59:36.051 --> 59:38.387
Don't be scared
for once in your life.

59:38.420 --> 59:39.722
Don't be scared!

1:00:08.817 --> 1:00:11.320
She felt his fingers on her skin

1:00:11.353 --> 1:00:17.927
even though she had never even seen
his face. His breath on her neck,

1:00:17.960 --> 1:00:22.164
even though... he may
not have even ever taken one...

1:00:23.399 --> 1:00:25.334
He was alive for her.

1:00:25.367 --> 1:00:29.104
Made from dust and particles
and the tremble of her lip.

1:00:31.373 --> 1:00:35.344
He moved perfectly
with her because...

1:00:35.377 --> 1:00:40.015
He was a part of her.
They were one, they were love.

1:00:40.049 --> 1:00:44.920
- Oh, beautifully said, marnie.
- It's Mary, actually.

1:00:44.954 --> 1:00:46.455
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

1:00:46.488 --> 1:00:49.291
Oh, did you have input
on Mary's inner lyrics?

1:00:49.325 --> 1:00:50.926
Oh, me? Nope.

1:00:52.828 --> 1:00:56.198
I mean, yeah,
it was just really great.

1:00:56.232 --> 1:00:58.167
- Wow.
- Thanks.

1:01:01.470 --> 1:01:02.504
Okay.

1:01:14.149 --> 1:01:15.951
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

1:01:18.954 --> 1:01:21.857
- I really liked your lyrics.
- Oh, thanks.

1:01:21.890 --> 1:01:25.027
I know I already...
I already said that, but I...

1:01:25.060 --> 1:01:29.031
- I just wanted to say it again, so, uh...
- Okay.

1:01:31.900 --> 1:01:33.369
- Hey.
- Yeah?

1:01:33.402 --> 1:01:36.005
I know it's maybe late
for this kind of thing,

1:01:36.038 --> 1:01:39.875
- but would you want to grab some coffee.
- Right now?

1:01:39.908 --> 1:01:43.312
Yeah, now, or later?

1:01:43.345 --> 1:01:47.116
- Or now?
- Um, I don't know, I...

1:01:48.884 --> 1:01:52.187
Um, yeah, you know what? Sure.

1:01:52.221 --> 1:01:56.158
Okay, awesome. I know this really
cool place right down the street.

1:01:56.191 --> 1:01:58.060
- Cool.
- Alright.

1:01:58.093 --> 1:02:00.796
Okay. Oh, okay. Yeah.

1:02:03.232 --> 1:02:07.369
- Plants smell great.
- Yeah. They're amazing.

1:02:07.403 --> 1:02:08.904
Is that a homeless person?

1:02:11.006 --> 1:02:13.542
Barbara!
What are you doing in my yard?

1:02:15.144 --> 1:02:18.213
- I like it here.
- Go home.

1:02:37.166 --> 1:02:38.267
He's cute.

1:02:39.902 --> 1:02:43.005
Don't make him wait for it
or else he'll find someone else.

1:02:47.343 --> 1:02:48.444
Barbara, no!

1:03:04.026 --> 1:03:05.461
I love your house.

1:03:05.494 --> 1:03:06.629
Thanks.

1:03:08.464 --> 1:03:09.464
All right.

1:03:15.705 --> 1:03:19.041
You really didn't have to walk
me home. I live super close.

1:03:19.074 --> 1:03:20.943
Oh, it's...
No, that's... that's okay.

1:03:20.976 --> 1:03:24.513
I wanted to. I really loved
hanging out with you tonight.

1:03:24.546 --> 1:03:27.416
I wish we'd done it sooner.

1:03:27.449 --> 1:03:28.484
Me too.

1:03:31.387 --> 1:03:36.158
I actually have
had this little crush on you.

1:03:36.191 --> 1:03:38.527
What? Really? You have?

1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:43.666
Oh my god, I've been wanting to ask you
out since like the first moment I saw you.

1:03:43.700 --> 1:03:46.335
You were wearing those
pink pants and I was like...

1:03:47.637 --> 1:03:50.607
I mean, anyway, uh...

1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:53.041
You should have.

1:03:53.075 --> 1:03:56.145
Well, I'm not, uh, tired.

1:03:56.178 --> 1:03:59.014
Do you want to maybe
work on some of our...

1:03:59.047 --> 1:04:04.119
I'm sorry, I can't,
I gotta... I have to go. Okay?

1:04:04.153 --> 1:04:05.421
Is everything okay?

1:04:05.454 --> 1:04:09.726
Um, yes, yes!
I'll call you, okay?

1:04:09.759 --> 1:04:11.728
Uh...

1:04:13.195 --> 1:04:14.195
I...

1:04:20.737 --> 1:04:24.641
Weird. That was super weird.

1:04:24.674 --> 1:04:25.742
Jeff...

1:04:32.448 --> 1:04:33.515
Jeffrey...

1:04:35.718 --> 1:04:38.020
I'm... I'm sorry!

1:04:39.388 --> 1:04:43.025
It's nothing. He's nobody.

1:04:43.058 --> 1:04:45.294
You know, I'm sorry.

1:04:59.742 --> 1:05:00.742
Ow.

1:05:04.146 --> 1:05:05.414
Jeffrey.

1:05:10.419 --> 1:05:11.621
You're hurting me.

1:05:17.627 --> 1:05:20.395
Let me go.

1:05:43.118 --> 1:05:44.118
No...

1:06:05.742 --> 1:06:10.212
Okay, I'm sensing a lot of
tension, a lot of negative energy.

1:06:10.245 --> 1:06:12.147
Yeah, okay.

1:06:12.180 --> 1:06:13.180
You think?

1:06:15.484 --> 1:06:17.519
Mary...

1:06:17.553 --> 1:06:20.088
Why am I here
in the middle of the night?

1:06:20.122 --> 1:06:21.658
What can teru fix for you?

1:06:21.691 --> 1:06:25.728
- Everything, everything's fucked.
- Language.

1:06:27.864 --> 1:06:30.700
I did it.
I believed, I committed.

1:06:30.733 --> 1:06:35.203
I did what you said
and now he's fucking real.

1:06:35.237 --> 1:06:36.572
- Mary...
- And I met someone.

1:06:36.606 --> 1:06:39.308
- Mary, that is wonderful.
- Yeah?

1:06:39.341 --> 1:06:40.843
Yeah.

1:06:40.877 --> 1:06:43.813
But now I have a psycho,
jealous, invisible boyfriend

1:06:43.846 --> 1:06:45.715
waiting for me in my house!

1:06:45.748 --> 1:06:48.183
How do I make it stop?

1:06:48.216 --> 1:06:50.753
- Make it stop?
- Turn it off!

1:06:50.787 --> 1:06:54.624
Mary, it's your imagination.

1:06:54.657 --> 1:06:56.291
You just stop believing.

1:06:56.325 --> 1:06:59.696
No, that in there
is not my fucking imagination.

1:06:59.729 --> 1:07:02.632
I mean, it was...
It was nice and all.

1:07:02.665 --> 1:07:05.400
But now I have a real
living man who likes me back.

1:07:05.434 --> 1:07:07.737
He likes me back!

1:07:07.770 --> 1:07:09.237
And then I just...

1:07:10.539 --> 1:07:14.209
And now I'm in
the most fucked up

1:07:14.242 --> 1:07:16.378
love triangle of all time!

1:07:16.411 --> 1:07:18.380
Hey, your language
is seriously harshing my vibe.

1:07:19.616 --> 1:07:20.616
Uh-huh.

1:07:23.318 --> 1:07:27.289
Help me please, what do I do?

1:07:27.322 --> 1:07:29.659
Okay, listen to me,
listen to me.

1:07:29.692 --> 1:07:32.762
- Mm-hmm.
- I know it seems big and real and it's scary,

1:07:32.795 --> 1:07:38.233
but it's not, okay? It's simple.
The power of your mind,

1:07:38.266 --> 1:07:41.336
it's astonishing. All right?
You've been committing to this figment

1:07:41.370 --> 1:07:45.474
of your imagination for over six weeks.
You have opened yourself up

1:07:45.507 --> 1:07:50.345
and allowed yourself to become vulnerable,
you've allowed him to become real.

1:07:54.917 --> 1:07:55.917
Yeah?

1:07:59.421 --> 1:08:01.256
- Mary...
- Mm.

1:08:01.289 --> 1:08:02.524
Did you two have sex?

1:08:05.962 --> 1:08:07.730
That's beautiful.

1:08:07.764 --> 1:08:12.401
That... oh, that is beautiful.

1:08:12.434 --> 1:08:15.905
Okay, so, listen up.

1:08:15.938 --> 1:08:20.308
When you're ready to come back to
reality and rejoin the real world,

1:08:20.342 --> 1:08:26.214
you just stop believing in him, okay?
He doesn't exist if you don't allow him to.

1:08:27.617 --> 1:08:30.687
- He... he attacked me.
- Oh, don't be a victim, Mary.

1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:32.989
Come on, take your power back.

1:08:33.022 --> 1:08:36.391
- Invite your new man over and show, um...
- Jeffrey.

1:08:36.425 --> 1:08:38.260
Jeffrey.

1:08:38.293 --> 1:08:41.263
And show Jeffrey
that he is not needed anymore.

1:08:41.296 --> 1:08:45.802
Okay? That he has no place in
your world or within your mind,

1:08:45.835 --> 1:08:48.503
that you live amongst
our present reality

1:08:48.537 --> 1:08:50.907
of our time and space
right here on earth.

1:08:52.507 --> 1:08:53.507
Okay?

1:08:55.712 --> 1:09:02.384
So, are you saying that I just bring brax
over and Jeffrey will just fade away?

1:09:02.417 --> 1:09:06.656
- I can move on?
- Yeah, that's exactly what I just said, almost word for word.

1:09:08.725 --> 1:09:10.693
Do you want to come in
and see for yourself?

1:09:10.727 --> 1:09:13.261
Oh, no, no, I can't go in there.

1:09:13.295 --> 1:09:17.734
No. It's full of darkness, and the
presence I'm feeling in there is, uh...

1:09:17.767 --> 1:09:19.001
It's not good.

1:09:20.603 --> 1:09:21.938
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

1:09:24.006 --> 1:09:25.808
Okay.

1:09:25.842 --> 1:09:28.310
Oh, uh, don't forget.

1:09:28.343 --> 1:09:29.703
This is very important,
look at me.

1:09:30.980 --> 1:09:34.416
Recommend me to all your friends.
Follow me on all socials.

1:09:34.449 --> 1:09:35.952
- Okay?
- I will do.

1:09:35.985 --> 1:09:36.985
Okay.

1:09:44.459 --> 1:09:45.459
Fuck it.

1:09:49.098 --> 1:09:50.833
This is my life.

1:09:50.867 --> 1:09:54.369
Oh, man. I'm in control.

1:09:56.773 --> 1:09:58.373
Okay. I'm in control.

1:09:59.842 --> 1:10:02.612
I'm in control!

1:10:14.991 --> 1:10:17.425
Go the fuck away!

1:11:09.578 --> 1:11:12.615
- You okay?
- Yeah! I'm okay.

1:11:16.986 --> 1:11:18.988
Oh. Hold on. Yeah.

1:11:34.871 --> 1:11:37.907
- Nightcap?
- I'm not gonna say no to that.

1:11:37.940 --> 1:11:41.811
- Thank you.
- Um, let me take your coat.

1:11:41.844 --> 1:11:42.912
Oh, okay.

1:11:46.115 --> 1:11:47.449
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1:12:06.534 --> 1:12:07.535
I...

1:12:09.872 --> 1:12:12.909
Um...

1:12:16.112 --> 1:12:17.445
I know I sound really...

1:12:19.547 --> 1:12:21.516
Drunk and cheesy, but, um...

1:12:23.219 --> 1:12:28.090
These past few weeks have been
really fun hanging out with you.

1:12:29.725 --> 1:12:35.064
I... I think
you're really cute and funny.

1:12:35.097 --> 1:12:38.167
Thank you. Me too.

1:12:38.200 --> 1:12:42.570
I can't believe I found a girl
that likes my cat as much as I do.

1:12:42.605 --> 1:12:46.075
I might even like him
better than you.

1:12:46.108 --> 1:12:48.811
That's fair. I love him
pretty much more than anybody.

1:12:51.781 --> 1:12:55.718
Thanks for finally having me over here.

1:12:55.751 --> 1:12:57.687
Yeah.

1:12:57.720 --> 1:12:59.521
I think I might
like you the best.

1:13:10.967 --> 1:13:11.967
Yeah.

1:13:16.105 --> 1:13:18.774
Ow! What the fuck?

1:13:20.176 --> 1:13:23.179
Mary! What the fuck?

1:13:23.212 --> 1:13:25.614
I think someone just bit me.

1:13:27.950 --> 1:13:30.252
What the... where's my phone?

1:14:12.661 --> 1:14:14.063
Brax.

1:14:14.096 --> 1:14:15.607
I went to grab my phone
because I realized

1:14:15.631 --> 1:14:17.333
that I left it in the car.

1:14:17.366 --> 1:14:19.168
Hello? Are you...

1:14:29.812 --> 1:14:32.081
Did he seriously
take his coat and leave?

1:14:34.183 --> 1:14:35.684
Brax?

1:14:35.718 --> 1:14:36.719
Hello?

1:14:55.971 --> 1:14:58.007
It's fine.

1:14:58.040 --> 1:14:59.942
He'll call.

1:14:59.975 --> 1:15:01.277
He's not going to ghost you.

1:15:01.310 --> 1:15:04.947
No. No, he likes you.

1:15:04.980 --> 1:15:10.953
He does. Yeah,
yeah, he likes you. It's fine.

1:15:10.986 --> 1:15:12.088
I'll be okay.

1:15:13.889 --> 1:15:15.624
He'll call.

1:15:15.658 --> 1:15:18.627
Yeah. Okay. I'll just...
I'll just go to bed.

1:15:18.661 --> 1:15:19.661
Yeah.

1:15:46.989 --> 1:15:48.991
Mm.

1:15:49.024 --> 1:15:50.626
Brax, where did you go?

1:18:30.552 --> 1:18:32.821
Are you sure that
you're ready for this?

1:18:32.855 --> 1:18:35.124
I have to do it.
I know it's weird.

1:18:35.157 --> 1:18:38.327
- I just need to try.
- I'm here for you, baby k.

1:18:38.360 --> 1:18:41.130
Okay, look, we do this
and then we get super fucked up.

1:18:41.163 --> 1:18:43.866
Like, Lucy going down on that
guy on space mountain fucked up.

1:18:43.899 --> 1:18:46.235
- Deal?
- What? Why was that fucked up?

1:18:46.268 --> 1:18:49.938
Okay. One, you just met the dude. Two,
it was that girl from math class' dad, so.

1:18:49.972 --> 1:18:52.341
- So?
- So, so, you're a whore.

1:18:52.374 --> 1:18:55.612
Okay. Yeah, you're just jealous
because he liked me better than you.

1:18:55.645 --> 1:18:57.880
Have some respect. He was
there with his family, okay?

1:18:57.913 --> 1:18:59.882
Right. And I made it
the happiest place on earth.

1:18:59.915 --> 1:19:01.926
- Yeah. Thanks for the support guys.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Love you.

1:19:01.950 --> 1:19:04.520
- We love you.
- Mm-hmm. Let's just go before I chicken out.

1:19:04.553 --> 1:19:06.422
Okay.

1:19:06.455 --> 1:19:08.466
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Should
we take these Eddies first?

1:19:08.490 --> 1:19:12.461
- Dude, stop. No, don't do that.
- I'm gonna take one anyway.

1:19:14.496 --> 1:19:16.398
Oh, this is creepy, huh.

1:19:16.432 --> 1:19:18.100
We should knock,
should we knock?

1:19:18.133 --> 1:19:20.436
We can just, like, barge in.

1:19:26.208 --> 1:19:27.910
- Hello?
- Just go.

1:19:27.943 --> 1:19:29.078
Hello?

1:19:32.981 --> 1:19:35.250
Hello?

1:19:35.284 --> 1:19:37.996
- Dude, stop it, you're gonna summon the dead!
- Oh, god, how would that summon?

1:19:38.020 --> 1:19:40.198
"How would that summon?" Haven't
you seen any scary movie ever?

1:19:40.222 --> 1:19:41.457
- Shut up.
- Hello?

1:19:41.490 --> 1:19:44.293
- Jeez!
- Oh, fuck. Wow!

1:19:44.326 --> 1:19:46.995
You three got some tense energy.

1:19:50.933 --> 1:19:53.636
They're here for you. No?

1:19:53.670 --> 1:19:57.306
Um, yeah, I just
need some answers.

1:19:57.339 --> 1:19:59.541
They're just here for support.
I'm Karen.

1:20:01.510 --> 1:20:05.547
- Karen.
- Yeah, I know. I really got to change my name.

1:20:08.651 --> 1:20:13.255
Huh. I'm mistress Eden.
What can I do for you, Karen?

1:20:15.424 --> 1:20:20.095
I feel a lot of pain
radiating in you.

1:20:22.564 --> 1:20:25.567
I assume this is
about your sister.

1:20:25.602 --> 1:20:27.704
How the fuck did she know that?

1:20:27.737 --> 1:20:33.142
Yeah, I just need
some closure or something.

1:20:33.175 --> 1:20:35.310
My big sister's name was Ruby.

1:20:35.344 --> 1:20:38.147
She killed herself
almost three years ago.

1:20:38.180 --> 1:20:40.650
I just don't really get it.

1:20:40.683 --> 1:20:42.484
It's sort of
like eating me alive.

1:20:42.518 --> 1:20:44.453
I can't sleep.

1:20:44.486 --> 1:20:46.723
I just want to know why,

1:20:46.756 --> 1:20:51.527
what could have been so bad that she
would leave me, that she wanted to die.

1:20:53.328 --> 1:20:55.598
What made you come to me?

1:20:55.632 --> 1:20:58.701
Uh, yelp. You had
some really solid reviews.

1:20:58.735 --> 1:21:01.403
Yeah. Hopefully you'll keep
your four and a half stars.

1:21:03.338 --> 1:21:05.708
And what are your names?

1:21:05.742 --> 1:21:09.211
Um, Lucy. I'm Lucy.
Uh, this is... this is peepee.

1:21:09.244 --> 1:21:12.181
It's Peter, these bitches
call me peepee, I don't...

1:21:12.214 --> 1:21:15.451
No, it doesn't. Like, it suits him
though, right?

1:21:15.484 --> 1:21:18.353
Well, I'm not
one of your bitches,

1:21:18.387 --> 1:21:20.422
so I'll just call you Peter.

1:21:20.456 --> 1:21:24.727
- Okay.
- Lucy, Peter, please have a seat on either side of Karen.

1:21:24.761 --> 1:21:28.063
Karen, please
sit across from me.

1:21:28.096 --> 1:21:29.096
Um...

1:21:32.234 --> 1:21:34.169
Is this gonna be, like, scary?

1:21:35.471 --> 1:21:37.573
You can never predict the dead.

1:21:39.609 --> 1:21:43.579
- Fuck!
- You know, a reading like this,

1:21:43.613 --> 1:21:48.183
I usually charge 175 an hour.

1:21:48.217 --> 1:21:51.386
Don't worry about it.
My guy's freaking loaded.

1:21:51.420 --> 1:21:57.594
- What the fuck?
- Well, I was gonna offer 20% off, but in that case...

1:21:57.627 --> 1:22:02.632
It's fine, if you can help me reach her or
even just fucking feel better, I'll pay double.

1:22:02.665 --> 1:22:05.802
Hmm, fair enough.

1:22:05.835 --> 1:22:10.072
So, just so you're all aware...

1:22:11.608 --> 1:22:14.076
There is no system to this.

1:22:14.109 --> 1:22:16.512
Not one communication is alike.

1:22:17.847 --> 1:22:25.053
I need you to do everything
I ask without question.

1:22:26.321 --> 1:22:31.159
In a moment, I'm going to reach
out to your sister, Ruby.

1:22:31.193 --> 1:22:34.797
That being said, sometimes,

1:22:34.831 --> 1:22:39.167
when you call upon the dead,
others can answer...

1:22:40.469 --> 1:22:43.138
I have no control over this.

1:22:43.171 --> 1:22:46.709
You're opening up
a door to the unknown.

1:22:48.510 --> 1:22:50.379
Are you prepared for that?

1:22:52.582 --> 1:22:56.819
- I need you to say "yes".
- Yes.

1:22:56.853 --> 1:23:00.723
- Lucy?
- Um, yes.

1:23:00.757 --> 1:23:02.090
Peter?

1:23:04.727 --> 1:23:07.496
You guys really think we're
gonna meet a fucking ghost?

1:23:07.529 --> 1:23:10.132
- Peepee.
- Fine.

1:23:10.165 --> 1:23:11.768
Yes, whatever.

1:23:23.245 --> 1:23:27.215
Everyone, close your eyes.

1:23:31.921 --> 1:23:35.290
Open yourself up, Karen.

1:23:35.324 --> 1:23:38.795
Spread them open like
you did all last summer, Karen.

1:23:38.828 --> 1:23:40.897
Can you shut up?

1:23:40.930 --> 1:23:44.499
Allow your sister
to reach out to you

1:23:44.533 --> 1:23:49.338
in any way she feels she can.

1:23:49.371 --> 1:23:53.643
Ruby, I am open to you as well.

1:23:55.210 --> 1:23:58.180
Make my body your vessel.

1:24:00.349 --> 1:24:02.184
Ruby?

1:24:02.217 --> 1:24:03.786
Are you there?

1:24:05.888 --> 1:24:09.391
Ruby, you're safe.

1:24:12.795 --> 1:24:13.830
Ruby.

1:24:15.698 --> 1:24:17.566
We're waiting for you.

1:24:22.605 --> 1:24:24.339
Ruby?

1:24:24.373 --> 1:24:25.574
Are you there?

1:24:38.420 --> 1:24:41.490
Ruby, is that you?

1:24:44.359 --> 1:24:46.896
Okay, John Edward,
give us a show.

1:24:54.236 --> 1:24:56.571
I feel her.

1:24:58.875 --> 1:25:02.812
I... I feel her all over me.

1:25:05.447 --> 1:25:08.550
I'm going to count back from ten

1:25:08.584 --> 1:25:12.689
and allow the spirit
to consume me.

1:25:12.722 --> 1:25:19.261
When I get to one, I want you
to ask her your questions.

1:25:19.294 --> 1:25:22.264
Do you understand me?

1:25:22.297 --> 1:25:25.868
You will not be speaking to me.

1:25:25.902 --> 1:25:30.640
You will be speaking to Ruby.

1:25:30.673 --> 1:25:32.675
Yes. Yes.

1:25:32.709 --> 1:25:34.276
Ten...

1:25:35.812 --> 1:25:37.312
Nine...

1:25:38.547 --> 1:25:40.016
Eight...

1:25:41.450 --> 1:25:43.452
Seven...

1:25:43.485 --> 1:25:45.655
Six...

1:25:45.688 --> 1:25:47.422
Five...

1:25:48.958 --> 1:25:50.325
Four...

1:25:52.729 --> 1:25:53.763
Three...

1:25:55.530 --> 1:25:57.700
Two...

1:25:57.734 --> 1:25:59.367
One.

1:26:01.570 --> 1:26:03.840
Ruby? Is that really you?

1:26:07.476 --> 1:26:08.543
Yes.

1:26:08.577 --> 1:26:10.278
What the fuck? What the fuck?

1:26:10.312 --> 1:26:12.715
Okay, calm down.
Hey, calm down. Relax.

1:26:12.749 --> 1:26:15.027
What do you mean "calm down"? Was that
Ruby's fucking voice? She's a fucking ghost!

1:26:15.051 --> 1:26:17.395
- Yes, that is why we're fucking here.
- Yes, I didn't think it was

1:26:17.419 --> 1:26:19.598
gonna be real! I thought it was
gonna be some mental healing for k!

1:26:19.622 --> 1:26:22.058
- Not some...
- Stop! Hey, you need to stop!

1:26:22.091 --> 1:26:25.895
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

1:26:25.928 --> 1:26:27.764
I'm sorry. We're okay.

1:26:27.797 --> 1:26:28.798
Go ahead.

1:26:31.067 --> 1:26:33.335
Ruby?

1:26:33.368 --> 1:26:38.540
I need you to tell me why.
We had our deal.

1:26:38.573 --> 1:26:43.980
We were gonna get old and get that
farmhouse and fill it full of birds.

1:26:44.013 --> 1:26:48.416
We were going to leave her husband and
drink whiskey and bitch on the front porch

1:26:48.450 --> 1:26:50.519
like grandma did.

1:26:50.552 --> 1:26:53.355
Why did you leave me like that?

1:26:53.388 --> 1:26:55.357
How could you leave me behind?

1:26:58.094 --> 1:26:59.695
She says...

1:27:01.530 --> 1:27:04.432
She couldn't take it
any longer.

1:27:06.035 --> 1:27:08.070
Too much pain.

1:27:09.538 --> 1:27:12.074
What couldn't you take?

1:27:12.108 --> 1:27:13.575
The guilt.

1:27:15.711 --> 1:27:18.748
The consequences.

1:27:18.781 --> 1:27:20.817
Killed? For what?

1:27:22.885 --> 1:27:25.688
Killing Jamie.

1:27:25.721 --> 1:27:27.455
Who the fuck is Jamie?

1:27:27.489 --> 1:27:30.726
Jamie was her piece
of shit ex boyfriend.

1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:32.929
He died like a year before her.

1:27:32.962 --> 1:27:35.607
No, Ruby. You weren't there.
The police said it was like a drug deal

1:27:35.631 --> 1:27:37.934
gone wrong or something.

1:27:37.967 --> 1:27:39.869
Wrong!

1:27:42.038 --> 1:27:44.941
She never told
anybody the truth.

1:27:46.474 --> 1:27:49.544
She says she was there.

1:27:49.578 --> 1:27:51.614
Ruby, what happened?

1:27:54.150 --> 1:27:56.518
Ruby, what happened?

1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:11.667
Oh.

1:28:14.837 --> 1:28:15.838
Oh, god.

1:28:20.776 --> 1:28:22.078
I can see it.

1:28:35.157 --> 1:28:37.593
- I can see it.
- No, no. Okay. No.

1:28:37.627 --> 1:28:40.596
Fuck this. Fuck this.
I don't need to be here.

1:28:40.630 --> 1:28:44.700
I never even fucking met Ruby,
so, good luck with the ghosts

1:28:44.734 --> 1:28:48.536
and the... you guys, please...
Nah, fuck this, man.

1:28:51.874 --> 1:28:58.581
That night, Ruby waited up
for Jamie for hours.

1:29:02.051 --> 1:29:06.222
<i>She was always the odd
one out with Jamie and his roommates.</i>

1:29:06.255 --> 1:29:09.025
<i>They were always
messed up on drugs.</i>

1:29:09.058 --> 1:29:10.192
<i>She loved him.</i>

1:29:10.226 --> 1:29:11.426
Move.

1:29:12.695 --> 1:29:15.698
<i>Even though
it didn't make any sense.</i>

1:29:27.575 --> 1:29:29.946
There's my girl.

1:29:29.979 --> 1:29:32.248
Where the fuck were you, Jamie?
It's almost morning.

1:29:37.153 --> 1:29:38.621
I was off.

1:29:40.990 --> 1:29:43.025
You think you're
in charge now? Huh? Huh?

1:29:43.059 --> 1:29:45.493
- Stop. Stop!
- I don't answer to you now, do you hear me?

1:29:48.664 --> 1:29:52.635
You good? Hey.
You good, you good?

1:29:52.668 --> 1:29:55.871
You ever embarrass me like that
again, I'll fucking kill you. Got it?

1:29:55.905 --> 1:29:58.774
You're a fucking bitch, Ruby.
Nothing but a fucking bitch to return!

1:30:08.117 --> 1:30:10.485
Quit your crying.

1:30:17.593 --> 1:30:19.095
Shut the fuck up!

1:30:21.097 --> 1:30:22.798
I fucking hate this!

1:30:25.267 --> 1:30:27.535
I don't love you, I'd leave!

1:30:29.605 --> 1:30:31.874
I would never let you leave me.

1:30:31.907 --> 1:30:34.777
- I know what you want. I know what you want.
- Fucking stop!

1:30:34.810 --> 1:30:36.712
Fucking stop! Fucking stop!

1:30:40.649 --> 1:30:43.652
- No. No. Fucking stop it!
- I know what you want, you want this.

1:30:43.686 --> 1:30:45.254
- Stop it!
- You want this.

1:30:45.287 --> 1:30:47.890
No! Fucking...
Don't fucking touch me!

1:30:47.923 --> 1:30:50.292
No, please stop it.
Fucking stop it!

1:30:56.899 --> 1:30:59.567
Don't hit me!

1:31:00.970 --> 1:31:02.772
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

1:31:05.941 --> 1:31:07.076
Fuck. Fuck.

1:31:12.748 --> 1:31:13.883
Ruby!

1:31:15.985 --> 1:31:18.687
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1:31:18.721 --> 1:31:20.790
<i>Ruby knew that he meant it.</i>

1:31:20.823 --> 1:31:25.795
<i>If he got in that room, he was
fucked up enough to kill her.</i>

1:31:51.153 --> 1:31:52.288
Ruby!

1:31:53.823 --> 1:31:55.991
You're fucking dead!

1:31:56.025 --> 1:31:59.028
When I get this door open,
and I will,

1:31:59.061 --> 1:32:00.996
you're fucking dead!

1:32:03.299 --> 1:32:05.034
You're never going to leave me.

1:32:07.403 --> 1:32:09.105
I'm gonna kill you.

1:32:09.138 --> 1:32:11.974
You're never gonna leave me.

1:32:15.077 --> 1:32:17.213
Give me a big fucking knife.

1:32:17.246 --> 1:32:19.014
We're gonna gut this bitch!

1:32:23.919 --> 1:32:28.057
Oh, god. I don't know
what I'm doing.

1:32:29.959 --> 1:32:32.328
I don't know.
I wish I believed in god.

1:32:32.361 --> 1:32:35.197
I don't know who I'm praying to.

1:32:41.203 --> 1:32:45.374
If anything or anyone
can hear me...

1:32:45.407 --> 1:32:47.810
Please help me.
I'll do anything.

1:32:50.412 --> 1:32:53.048
Just don't let me die.

1:32:53.082 --> 1:32:55.351
Please don't let me
die like this.

1:33:01.790 --> 1:33:03.125
You're dead, bitch!

1:33:03.159 --> 1:33:05.361
You will belong to me.

1:33:07.196 --> 1:33:14.203
<i>This was the
first time she laid eyes on it.</i>

1:33:14.236 --> 1:33:15.304
I don't know.

1:33:21.911 --> 1:33:23.812
What are you?

1:33:23.846 --> 1:33:28.083
Your deepest
fear and your only chance.

1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:32.454
What do you want?

1:33:32.488 --> 1:33:36.392
Your mind. You serve me.

1:33:36.425 --> 1:33:38.127
You do what is asked.

1:33:41.163 --> 1:33:43.799
I am in you.

1:33:45.367 --> 1:33:47.736
I can't. I can't.

1:33:49.305 --> 1:33:52.875
When you die,
try not to fuck up my floor!

1:33:52.908 --> 1:33:55.377
The next one, he's in.

1:33:59.381 --> 1:34:01.283
You agree?

1:34:01.317 --> 1:34:05.087
Okay. Okay. I... yes.

1:34:06.522 --> 1:34:08.357
I agree.

1:34:08.390 --> 1:34:10.426
Show me.

1:34:10.459 --> 1:34:13.295
<i>Ruby realized
she was making a deal</i>

1:34:13.329 --> 1:34:17.299
<i>with something darker than
she could even understand.</i>

1:34:18.834 --> 1:34:23.105
I'm gonna cut you up and do things
to your body you can't imagine.

1:34:32.982 --> 1:34:34.049
Good.

1:34:42.958 --> 1:34:44.026
More.

1:34:52.534 --> 1:34:53.535
Fuck!

1:35:29.104 --> 1:35:31.173
So much darkness.

1:35:33.008 --> 1:35:35.477
I see what has happened.

1:35:35.511 --> 1:35:39.848
The things it showed her...

1:35:39.882 --> 1:35:41.350
Asked of her...

1:35:43.653 --> 1:35:45.487
Ruby had to do it.

1:35:47.256 --> 1:35:50.092
She had to die.

1:35:50.125 --> 1:35:51.994
Oh my god, that's so fucked.

1:35:52.027 --> 1:35:53.996
Ruby, I'm so sorry.

1:36:09.411 --> 1:36:11.980
It's trying to get in!

1:36:12.014 --> 1:36:14.983
I feel a portal opening!

1:36:15.017 --> 1:36:18.020
I warned you
that's gonna happen!

1:36:18.053 --> 1:36:22.891
- Stop it, please stop!
- I have no control over it!

1:36:22.925 --> 1:36:25.961
Ruby dying angered it!

1:36:25.994 --> 1:36:28.464
And now the darkness
from this thing

1:36:28.497 --> 1:36:31.601
is dripping through

1:36:31.634 --> 1:36:36.138
like a bloodline to the weak.

1:36:36.171 --> 1:36:40.008
It sense the vulnerable
and loss,

1:36:40.042 --> 1:36:43.045
the afraid among them.

1:36:43.078 --> 1:36:46.616
And it punished them
for her choices!

1:36:48.050 --> 1:36:50.620
Ruby broke her deal.

1:36:50.653 --> 1:36:55.324
Now the darkness
is seeping through!

1:36:55.357 --> 1:37:00.963
It was all a path to you, Karen!

1:37:00.996 --> 1:37:02.364
Stop it!

1:37:02.398 --> 1:37:05.434
The one she loved the most!

1:37:19.515 --> 1:37:21.316
Lucy, oh my god!

1:37:28.157 --> 1:37:30.092
Ruby?

1:37:30.125 --> 1:37:32.127
Oh my god, Ruby?

1:37:46.475 --> 1:37:48.544
No!

1:37:50.212 --> 1:37:52.649
I served you in my life.
I'm dead.

1:37:52.682 --> 1:37:56.418
It's fucking over!
Nobody called you here!

1:37:56.452 --> 1:37:57.453
Fucking go!

1:37:58.788 --> 1:38:00.289
- Go!
- Not without you!

1:38:02.090 --> 1:38:05.595
You have my body,
you took my life.

1:38:05.628 --> 1:38:07.162
It's fucking over.

1:38:08.765 --> 1:38:10.399
It's over!

1:38:15.337 --> 1:38:19.241
Mistress Eden, say goodbye,
we have to close it.

1:38:19.274 --> 1:38:21.076
Mistress Eden.

1:38:26.716 --> 1:38:30.319
Run!

1:38:30.352 --> 1:38:31.630
- We have to go now!
- What about Lucy?

1:38:31.654 --> 1:38:32.655
Not now!

1:38:33.455 --> 1:38:35.057
What the fuck is going on?

1:38:35.090 --> 1:38:37.426
- Okay, where the fuck is Lucy?
- Get in the car!

1:38:37.459 --> 1:38:39.662
- What?
- Get in the fucking car, peepee!

1:38:39.696 --> 1:38:42.030
Fuck. This is so fucked.
What is happening?

1:38:44.266 --> 1:38:45.768
Oh.

1:38:45.802 --> 1:38:47.804
So, um, is Lucy staying, or?

1:38:47.837 --> 1:38:50.707
- Drive!
- Okay, I'm getting pretty freaked out now!

1:38:50.740 --> 1:38:53.308
Can either of you explain to me
what the fuck happened in there?

1:38:53.342 --> 1:38:58.046
- Where the fuck is Lucy and who the fuck is that?
- Ruby.

1:38:58.080 --> 1:39:01.283
Ruby? Not to be rude or anything
but isn't Ruby fucking dead?

1:39:01.316 --> 1:39:04.520
- Boo.
- Oh fuck. Okay, cool. We're just hanging out with ghosts now.

1:39:04.553 --> 1:39:07.289
By the way. Really nice to meet you, Ruby.
I've heard great things.

1:39:07.322 --> 1:39:10.058
Um, so, can either of you
explain to me where Lucy is?

1:39:10.092 --> 1:39:12.528
