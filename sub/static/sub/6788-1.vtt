02:29.651 --> 02:30.735
Where's Jay?

02:34.739 --> 02:38.451
How long were those potatoes
under the fire? How'd you do that?

02:49.420 --> 02:52.507
- Somebody will see!
- No way.

02:58.262 --> 03:02.350
- Does Maryann kiss as good as I do?
- How would I know?

03:15.947 --> 03:20.451
- You said we were special.
- I meant everything.

04:06.247 --> 04:10.043
- That's not allowed.
- Come on.

04:15.381 --> 04:20.011
Come on. A man is not made out of stone.

04:23.806 --> 04:25.933
Somebody's there!

04:35.568 --> 04:39.030
We weren't doing anything.
We were just messing a...

04:49.749 --> 04:52.001
Please, don't!

05:02.762 --> 05:05.139
No!

07:19.565 --> 07:22.902
Hi, girl. Excuse me! Hi, boy.

07:23.069 --> 07:26.614
You speak English?
How far is it to Camp Crystal Lake?

07:26.781 --> 07:31.661
That far?
Okey-dokey. See you later.

07:40.486 --> 07:44.616
<i>It's 7:01 on Friday the 13th of June.</i>

07:44.782 --> 07:49.495
<i>This is Big Dave and it's time for you
lazybones to get out of bed.</i>

07:49.662 --> 07:53.208
<i>It's black-cat day in Crystal Lake.</i>

08:00.381 --> 08:03.468
<i>I must have seen that Kojak 82 times.</i>

08:03.635 --> 08:06.637
Excuse me. How far
is Camp Crystal Lake from here?

08:12.893 --> 08:15.896
What is it, Enos? About 20 miles?

08:16.063 --> 08:18.023
- About that.
- Camp Blood?

08:18.190 --> 08:22.152
- They're opening that place again?
- Lots of luck.

08:22.319 --> 08:25.447
- Can I get a bus or something?
- Not likely.

08:25.656 --> 08:30.911
You going out to the crossroads, Enos?
What about a lift? That would be halfway.

08:31.078 --> 08:34.581
No sweat, Trudy. Okay, kid, let's move it.

08:35.582 --> 08:39.336
- Name's Annie.
- All right, Annie, let's go.

08:46.635 --> 08:48.929
All the girls up there
gonna look as good as you?

08:49.096 --> 08:51.139
I don't know.

08:51.557 --> 08:56.228
- You're going to Camp Blood, ain't you?
- Goddamn it, Ralph, get out of here!

08:56.395 --> 08:59.522
- Leave people alone!
- You'll never come back!

08:59.730 --> 09:01.774
Oh, shut up, Ralph!

09:02.733 --> 09:06.070
It's got a death curse!

09:08.072 --> 09:11.033
He's a real prophet of doom, ain't he?

09:11.993 --> 09:13.035
Climb up, miss.

09:32.179 --> 09:36.684
He's causing problems enough
for your boss with all that talk.

09:38.060 --> 09:40.813
Goddamn nuisance.

10:04.878 --> 10:07.881
- He tell you anything?
- Who?

10:08.048 --> 10:10.675
Your boss. Steve Christy.

10:10.842 --> 10:14.679
I'll be cooking for 50 kids and 10 staff.

10:14.846 --> 10:20.352
- Campers will mostly be inner-city children.
- No, I mean about what happened.

10:23.146 --> 10:25.106
No.

10:29.945 --> 10:33.031
Come on. There's something
you're not telling me.

10:35.325 --> 10:40.579
- Quit. Quit now.
- Quit? Why would I want to quit?

10:41.497 --> 10:43.874
Camp Crystal Lake is jinxed!

10:44.083 --> 10:48.504
Terrific. Not you too. You sound
like your crazy friend back there.

10:48.671 --> 10:53.592
Well, maybe. Did Christy tell you about
the two kids murdered in '58?

10:54.385 --> 10:59.306
Boy drowning in '57? A bunch of fires?

10:59.473 --> 11:01.642
Nobody knows who did any of them.

11:01.809 --> 11:06.522
In 1962, they were going to open up.
The water was bad.

11:06.689 --> 11:09.900
Christy will end up like his folks:
Crazy and broke.

11:10.067 --> 11:14.989
He's been up there a year fixing up that
place. Must have dropped $25,000.

11:15.155 --> 11:19.034
And for what? Ask anybody.

11:19.702 --> 11:23.247
- Quit!
- I can't.

11:23.914 --> 11:27.126
Dumb kids. Know-it-alls.

11:27.293 --> 11:30.837
Just like my nieces. Heads full of rocks.

11:31.045 --> 11:36.759
- You're an American original.
- I'm an American original.

11:36.926 --> 11:42.181
- Dumb kid.
- At least I'm not afraid of ghosts.

12:03.119 --> 12:06.831
- Take care of yourself.
- No sweat. Thanks for the lift.

12:40.030 --> 12:44.076
Hey, Marcie. You really think
there'll be other gorgeous women...

12:44.243 --> 12:47.329
...at Camp Crystal Lake besides yourself?

12:47.496 --> 12:51.833
- Is sex all you ever think about, Ned?
- Hey, no. No. Absolutely not.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.045
Sometimes I just think about
kissing women.

13:57.190 --> 14:00.735
- You wanna give me a hand over here?
- Sure.

14:02.027 --> 14:04.613
Alice! I wanna get this tree stump out.

14:04.779 --> 14:08.366
Get on this side, you pull
on that side. Alice!

14:08.533 --> 14:09.826
Coming.

14:13.580 --> 14:16.583
- That's great. I'm Steve Christy.
- Jack.

14:16.750 --> 14:18.293
- Marcie
- Ned Rubinstein.

14:18.460 --> 14:21.171
Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.
This is Alice.

14:21.379 --> 14:23.590
Hi. Steve, Cabin B is all ready.

14:23.757 --> 14:28.345
- Where's Bill? Cleaning out the boathouse?
- Haven't seen him in half an hour.

14:28.553 --> 14:31.014
I wanted him to start painting. Brenda?

14:31.181 --> 14:35.810
- Setting up the archery range.
- I'd rather she paint. Come on. Let's go.

14:35.977 --> 14:38.021
I thought we had two weeks.

14:38.188 --> 14:41.399
Come on. I'll show you
where you can get changed.

14:49.991 --> 14:54.119
- Here, let me give you a hand with that.
- Thank you.

15:03.212 --> 15:05.005
You got it?

15:25.943 --> 15:28.320
You draw very well.

15:29.613 --> 15:33.200
Thanks. I wish I had more time to do it.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.035
Oh, dummy.

15:36.120 --> 15:39.582
- When did you do this?
- Last night.

15:40.958 --> 15:44.919
- Do I really look like that?
- You did last night.

15:50.341 --> 15:52.719
You're very talented.

15:54.846 --> 15:57.140
You're very pretty.

15:59.184 --> 16:02.020
This really isn't your cup of tea, is it?

16:02.812 --> 16:05.023
Any particular reason?

16:05.190 --> 16:09.360
It's just a problem I have.
It's nothing personal.

16:11.988 --> 16:14.741
- You wanna leave?
- I don't know. I may have to...

16:14.908 --> 16:17.911
...go back to California
to straighten something out.

16:21.039 --> 16:24.375
Come on. Give me another chance.

16:25.293 --> 16:28.713
Stay a week.
Help get the place ready.

16:29.172 --> 16:34.302
By Friday, if you're not happy,
I'll put you on the bus myself.

16:35.427 --> 16:39.556
All right. Friday. I'll give it a week.

16:46.146 --> 16:48.232
Thanks, Alice.

17:02.704 --> 17:05.915
Bill? Steve wants to know
if we need more paint.

17:06.083 --> 17:09.670
- Paint's all right. Need more thinner.
- Okay.

17:09.836 --> 17:14.842
- Alice. Did the others show up?
- Yeah, everybody except that girl Annie.

17:15.050 --> 17:20.012
- Think you're gonna last all summer?
- I don't know if I'm gonna last all week.

17:20.180 --> 17:22.766
- I'll tell Steve about the thinner.
- Fine.

17:37.780 --> 17:40.783
- You want it listed separately?
- Right.

17:40.950 --> 17:43.828
Brenda, I want you to
finish the archery range.

17:43.995 --> 17:48.291
If Annie gets here, get her started
in the kitchen. Do your best.

17:48.457 --> 17:50.668
I'll be back sometime after lunch.

17:50.835 --> 17:55.590
It's supposed to rain like hell,
so get as much done as possible.

18:01.304 --> 18:06.142
He neglected to mention that downtown
they call this place "Camp Blood."

18:06.309 --> 18:11.022
Next there'll be snakes in the
outhouse and crocodiles in the lake.

18:11.189 --> 18:14.275
No, the crocodiles are in the cabins.

18:42.511 --> 18:43.929
Are you crazy?

18:44.012 --> 18:48.266
Wanna see my trick shot?
It's even better.

18:49.476 --> 18:52.437
I don't believe you!

18:54.689 --> 18:58.360
You know, you're beautiful
when you're angry, sweetheart.

18:58.527 --> 18:59.569
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:59.736 --> 19:03.615
You come to help me or scare
me to death? You do that again...

19:03.782 --> 19:07.701
...I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
- I love that sexy talk!

19:32.142 --> 19:35.938
Hi. I'm going to Camp Crystal Lake.

19:50.369 --> 19:52.913
Guess I always wanted to
work with children.

19:53.080 --> 19:57.251
I hate when people call them "kids."
Sounds like little goats.

19:57.418 --> 20:01.838
But when you've had a dream
as long as I have, you'll do anything.

20:23.610 --> 20:27.614
Hey, wasn't that the road for
Camp Crystal Lake back there?

20:32.744 --> 20:35.121
I think we better stop.

20:37.707 --> 20:39.459
Please?

20:41.669 --> 20:46.049
Stop, please! Please! Stop!

20:46.591 --> 20:48.967
Please, stop!

22:12.383 --> 22:15.636
No. No.

22:17.847 --> 22:18.890
No.

22:30.734 --> 22:35.071
All right, move it out. A little to the left.
Little to the left.

22:39.201 --> 22:44.915
Move it out. Move it out. Okay,
little to the left. Now... No, no.

22:45.665 --> 22:49.503
Let's go. Okay. Okay. Good. Good.

23:01.598 --> 23:05.227
If you were a flavor of ice cream,
what would it be?

23:05.393 --> 23:09.356
- Rocky Road.
- Hey!

23:22.451 --> 23:25.412
What's that vitamin C
stuff do for you, anyway?

23:25.579 --> 23:29.792
Vitamin C is supposed to neutralize
the nitrates or something.

23:30.668 --> 23:34.129
What's the matter?
Do you see something?

23:37.091 --> 23:39.468
No. Nothing.

23:42.888 --> 23:47.101
Ned! Get out of here!

23:55.150 --> 23:58.487
Hey, you guys.
Ready to go back to work?

23:58.571 --> 23:59.280
Yeah.

24:02.491 --> 24:06.203
- Come on, Alice.
- Help! Help!

24:06.412 --> 24:11.667
- Something's wrong with Ned.
- Get a life preserver!

24:28.224 --> 24:30.518
- Can he swim?
- I don't know.

24:30.685 --> 24:33.521
- He's right around here somewhere.
- I got it.

24:33.688 --> 24:36.107
Go ahead, dive for him.

24:37.942 --> 24:39.944
- There he is!
- Come on. Help me.

24:40.111 --> 24:42.071
Watch his head.

24:48.203 --> 24:51.206
- Watch his head!
- Got him?

24:57.545 --> 25:01.049
- Can you give mouth-to-mouth?
- Yeah.

25:05.886 --> 25:08.889
- Oh, God.
- Come on, Ned.

25:09.556 --> 25:12.142
- Oh, Neddy!
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

25:17.731 --> 25:22.236
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, all right?

25:54.892 --> 25:56.602
Bill!

25:56.769 --> 26:01.440
Bill, come here, quick! Hurry!

26:05.152 --> 26:08.865
- What is it?
- There's a snake over there.

26:09.031 --> 26:10.783
Where?

26:17.707 --> 26:20.626
- What do I do?
- Kill it.

26:20.793 --> 26:22.170
It might bite.

26:22.336 --> 26:26.132
- Haven't you ever been in the woods?
- We're not in the woods.

26:26.299 --> 26:28.467
- Bill, what are you doing?
- There's a snake.

26:28.634 --> 26:31.137
- Why are we in here?
- Feet don't fail me now!

26:31.304 --> 26:33.222
- There it is!
- Oh, God!

26:35.474 --> 26:39.228
- I can't sleep with a snake in here.
- Nobody said anything about snakes.

26:39.395 --> 26:43.232
- Kill it!
- I can't get it until it comes out.

26:43.399 --> 26:46.484
- Well, call him!
- How do you call a snake?

26:46.651 --> 26:48.528
I'll flush him!

26:54.117 --> 26:56.161
- I got it.
- Where?

26:56.328 --> 26:57.496
Look out!

26:57.662 --> 26:58.997
I got him!

27:02.959 --> 27:04.711
Oh, God.

27:09.090 --> 27:11.343
Is it dead?

27:11.510 --> 27:14.971
Either that or it's got a very short clone.

27:16.056 --> 27:20.894
- Well, at least we know what's for dinner.
- Marcie!

27:25.524 --> 27:28.318
I'm making salad. Want me
to make some for everybody?

27:28.485 --> 27:32.030
- That would be great. There's hamburger...
- None for me.

27:32.197 --> 27:34.616
There are apples.
Know how to make apple pie?

27:34.783 --> 27:38.619
- Sure. No sweat.
- What is going on?

27:47.878 --> 27:49.964
Oh, shit.

27:51.966 --> 27:55.886
- Who are you people?
- Camp counselors. Ned is fooling around.

27:56.053 --> 27:57.930
- Right, just...
- Can it, Cochise.

27:58.097 --> 28:00.516
Steve Christy hire you people?
He pay you for this?

28:00.683 --> 28:02.893
- Nice bike.
- You been smoking, boy?

28:03.060 --> 28:05.729
Smoking? Don't smoke. Causes cancer.

28:05.896 --> 28:11.151
You just get off a spaceship or something?
Colombian gold. Grass. Hash. The weed.

28:11.318 --> 28:13.404
- What's he talking about?
- Don't get smart.

28:13.571 --> 28:18.159
- Me? I'm as dumb as they come.
- Not another word out of you, understand?

28:18.325 --> 28:21.954
Nothing's going on here.
We're getting the place in shape.

28:22.121 --> 28:23.164
For what?

28:23.330 --> 28:26.958
- Is there anything we can do to help?
- I'm looking for somebody.

28:27.125 --> 28:31.045
- Who's that?
- A guy named Ralph. The town crazy.

28:31.212 --> 28:34.007
There's no crazy people around here.

28:34.174 --> 28:39.304
I told you to sit on it, Tonto. I got word
Ralph was pedaling out this way...

28:39.512 --> 28:42.765
...spouting his gospel.
- We haven't seen anybody here.

28:42.932 --> 28:45.935
- Just us.
- This guy Ralph. Is he dangerous?

28:46.561 --> 28:49.272
Every time that loony gets drunk,
he gets his calling.

28:49.439 --> 28:53.067
I spend the morning in court,
he gets a week in jail.

28:53.234 --> 28:57.447
<i>Cycle Two, where are you?
Come in, Cycle Two.</i>

28:57.614 --> 29:01.117
This is Dorf. I'm out here
at Camp Crystal Lake. Over.

29:01.284 --> 29:04.621
<i>Haul it back in, Dorf.
Chief wants you back in town.</i>

29:04.787 --> 29:09.292
Roger that. 10-4. On my way. Out.

29:09.459 --> 29:11.961
Never keep the chief waiting.

29:14.214 --> 29:19.676
You kids keep your noses clean.
You'll be hearing from me if you don't.

29:22.930 --> 29:25.849
We ain't gonna stand
for no weirdness out here.

30:10.685 --> 30:16.691
I'm a messenger of God.
You're doomed if you stay here.

30:18.693 --> 30:22.363
This place is cursed. Cursed.

30:23.906 --> 30:27.368
- It's got a death curse!
- Who are you?

30:27.535 --> 30:29.579
What do you want?

30:29.745 --> 30:34.125
- God sent me.
- Get out of here, man!

30:34.292 --> 30:39.172
I got to warn you.
You're doomed if you stay.

30:39.338 --> 30:43.759
Go. Go!

30:54.896 --> 30:59.524
- I think we just met Ralph.
- God, what's next?

31:09.659 --> 31:14.664
You're doomed. You're all doomed.

31:39.856 --> 31:41.358
- Who likes them rare?
- Me.

31:41.525 --> 31:44.861
How can you guys eat that?
It looks like dead animals.

31:45.028 --> 31:48.615
Dead animals? That's the old counselors.
You cannibals!

31:48.782 --> 31:51.867
If you would mix this stuff right,
you'd get all the protein you need.

31:52.034 --> 31:54.995
Too bad Annie never showed.
She was supposed to be a good cook.

31:55.162 --> 31:58.916
- Don't expect me to play chef.
- The squaws are revolting.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.961
- Trouble?
- Yeah. A bad bulb or no power.

32:02.127 --> 32:04.296
Seems a little gloomy in here.

32:04.463 --> 32:06.966
Steve taught me how to use
the emergency generator.

32:07.132 --> 32:10.678
- Town power lines are lousy.
- Don't you love that macho talk?

32:10.886 --> 32:12.930
Emergency generator.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.057
- Want to give me a hand?
- Yeah.

32:15.224 --> 32:17.768
- Wait for me.
- Can you watch the burgers?

32:17.935 --> 32:20.938
- Sure.
- Burn them.

32:24.483 --> 32:28.362
- Think he's gonna be bent out of shape?
- I don't know.

32:28.529 --> 32:32.449
This looks almost like the one
at my uncle's cabin in Maine.

32:32.616 --> 32:36.162
- Well, here goes.
- What an antique.

32:44.335 --> 32:47.297
Well, what hath God wrought?

34:04.039 --> 34:05.833
Hello?

34:15.217 --> 34:17.386
Can I help you?

34:23.599 --> 34:27.103
Hello? Hello?

34:28.603 --> 34:31.607
- Come on.
- Coming, I'm coming.

34:34.902 --> 34:39.072
Wind's come up.
Shifted a good 180 degrees.

34:39.239 --> 34:42.201
Makes me want to hold onto you.

34:46.038 --> 34:49.792
- What about Ned?
- I don't love Ned.

34:49.958 --> 34:53.170
- He keeps acting like such a jerk.
- Neddy!

34:53.337 --> 34:56.174
- Don't call him.
- Thought you wanted to give him...

34:56.340 --> 34:58.217
...one of your motherly lectures.

34:58.384 --> 35:02.972
Look, Neddy's gonna do whatever
Neddy wants to do, you know?

35:03.139 --> 35:07.768
It's gonna storm. Gonna tear down
that valley like a son of a gun.

35:07.935 --> 35:10.480
I've been afraid of storms
since I was little.

35:10.646 --> 35:12.940
No. Really?

35:13.107 --> 35:18.153
I've had this dream about five or six
times where I'm in a thunderstorm...

35:18.820 --> 35:25.160
...and it's raining really hard. It sounds
like pebbles when it hits the ground.

35:25.327 --> 35:31.166
I hear it and I try to block it out
with my hands, only it doesn't work.

35:31.333 --> 35:34.336
It just keeps getting
louder and louder.

35:37.172 --> 35:40.342
And then the rain turns to blood...

35:41.051 --> 35:45.847
...and the blood washes away
in little rivers...

35:47.057 --> 35:50.352
...and then the sound stops.

35:51.812 --> 35:57.859
- It's just a dream.
- I know. I call it my "shower dream."

35:58.151 --> 36:02.697
Hey, hey. This is no dream.
Come on, we're gonna get soaked.

38:02.981 --> 38:05.818
Jack and Marcie are gonna get drenched!

38:05.984 --> 38:08.529
Not if they're where I think they are.

38:34.429 --> 38:36.431
That's nice.

38:37.014 --> 38:39.976
I know what we can do.
We'll play Monopoly.

38:40.143 --> 38:43.354
- I hate Monopoly!
- Not the way I play it, you don't.

38:43.521 --> 38:46.691
- Like what?
- We're going to play strip Monopoly.

38:46.858 --> 38:51.237
- I'll be the shoe.
- You have got to be kidding.

38:51.404 --> 38:52.989
What if Steve walks in?

38:53.156 --> 38:57.577
We'll give him a handicap.
He can keep his boots on. It's easy.

38:57.743 --> 39:03.291
Instead of rent, you pay clothes. Bill
can be banker. Unless he's chicken.

39:03.457 --> 39:06.127
Heaven help you if you land
in my hotel!

39:06.294 --> 39:09.714
Why don't you see if Marcie
left any of that grass?

39:10.298 --> 39:14.218
- What happened to my 500's?
- They're there. Where's my shoe?

40:25.955 --> 40:28.999
I'm not going to pass "Go"
without a glow.

40:29.166 --> 40:31.961
We rolled for you. You're going last.

40:32.127 --> 40:35.464
Community Chest cannot
give you your clothes back.

40:36.423 --> 40:39.635
Double sixes! I get to roll again!

40:39.802 --> 40:42.888
- We're being hustled.
- I think you're right.

40:47.059 --> 40:49.770
You are so fine.

40:56.735 --> 40:58.737
Where are you going?

40:58.904 --> 41:02.032
I gotta pee.
You're lying on my bladder.

41:05.327 --> 41:10.123
Hurry back, okay?
It's getting cold in here.

41:19.048 --> 41:22.260
- You'll save my place for me?
- Yeah.

41:40.195 --> 41:41.529
Five.

41:42.614 --> 41:46.910
- Baltic Avenue. I'll buy it.
- No one ever lands on Baltic Avenue.

41:47.076 --> 41:49.204
I think it's a pretty color.

41:51.372 --> 41:52.916
Come on.

41:53.875 --> 41:55.376
Eight.

41:56.878 --> 42:02.007
- Baltic Avenue. You owe me one boot.
- Coming.

42:02.174 --> 42:04.343
Alice draws first blood.

42:04.510 --> 42:08.388
- Terrible way to talk about my feet.
- Thank you.

42:08.555 --> 42:09.848
Who's next?

42:11.725 --> 42:15.103
You know I think I'm beginning
to like this game.

42:15.270 --> 42:18.232
Wait until he lands
on my old Kentucky home.

42:18.398 --> 42:21.151
- More beer? More beer.
- Let's see. A railroad.

44:23.605 --> 44:27.984
<i>Forty Yards to the Outhouse,
by Willie Makit.</i>

44:28.610 --> 44:31.863
Come on, kids,
you can do better than that.

44:33.447 --> 44:34.990
Jack?

44:40.120 --> 44:41.831
Jack?

44:46.293 --> 44:47.670
Jack?

44:56.846 --> 45:01.058
When I looked into that mirror,
I knew I'd always be ugly.

45:02.143 --> 45:06.939
I said,
"Lizzie, you'll always be plain."

45:10.943 --> 45:12.153
Hello?

45:49.772 --> 45:51.024
Ned?

45:54.861 --> 45:57.155
Hey, come on, you guys.

46:41.657 --> 46:43.951
It must be my imagination.

47:03.178 --> 47:04.721
- Hello.
- Shit.

47:04.930 --> 47:07.765
Worst run of bad luck
since Richard Nixon.

47:07.932 --> 47:09.725
You can call it quits.

47:09.934 --> 47:15.064
Fat chance! You're two steps
from Pacific Avenue and Skin City.

47:21.404 --> 47:24.824
What can I say?
It's not much, but I call it home.

47:28.661 --> 47:31.330
- I'll get it. I'll get it.
- Get the money.

47:31.664 --> 47:34.584
- God!
- It's blowing like crazy out there.

47:34.792 --> 47:38.921
I think I left the windows
in my cabin open. Shoot!

47:41.424 --> 47:44.927
We'll have to finish this game
some other night.

47:45.136 --> 47:47.680
Just when it was getting interesting.

47:48.473 --> 47:51.058
- See you guys in the morning.
- See you.

47:51.267 --> 47:53.603
- Good night.
- Good night.

48:01.902 --> 48:04.237
Look at this mess! Here.

48:04.446 --> 48:08.825
- Were you going to go ahead with it?
- I hadn't made up my mind.

48:08.992 --> 48:11.995
We'll have to finish
the game another night.

48:29.346 --> 48:34.935
- Is there anything else you want?
- No, thanks, Sandy. I'm fine.

48:35.143 --> 48:38.313
You can't go out in that rain.
You want to drown?

48:38.522 --> 48:41.775
I've got to.
I've got six new counselors at camp.

48:41.983 --> 48:45.320
They are babes in the woods,
in every sense.

48:45.487 --> 48:50.032
They'll be okay if they know enough
to come out of the rain.

48:50.241 --> 48:54.703
- Well, what do I owe you?
- Just a night on the town, Steve.

48:54.912 --> 48:59.792
- Come on now, you know what I mean.
- That's okay. Two and a quarter.

49:03.045 --> 49:04.588
Thank you.

49:17.143 --> 49:19.979
- Here's your change.
- No, you keep it.

49:20.187 --> 49:21.397
- Thank you.
- Sure.

49:21.605 --> 49:23.149
- Drive careful.
- I will.

49:23.357 --> 49:24.358
Good night.

52:50.310 --> 52:51.561
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:51.770 --> 52:55.732
- Thought that'd go through anything.
- Not dragging a trailer.

52:55.941 --> 52:57.400
Can you give me a lift?

52:57.609 --> 53:01.737
- I'll have a counselor bring me back.
- Why not?

54:22.275 --> 54:24.152
Help me!

54:49.009 --> 54:51.094
Help me!

55:18.997 --> 55:20.374
Hello.

55:24.253 --> 55:29.925
- Hello.
- Over here. Please somebody help me.

55:30.092 --> 55:31.385
Hello.

55:34.804 --> 55:36.097
Hello.

55:40.143 --> 55:41.435
Hello.

55:46.983 --> 55:48.234
Hello?

55:53.906 --> 55:59.579
Come quickly, please.
Come quickly. Help.

56:13.301 --> 56:16.637
Where are you? Hello.

56:36.531 --> 56:37.783
Hello?

56:44.331 --> 56:45.540
All right.

56:47.918 --> 56:50.670
Come on out! You're not funny anymore!

56:52.672 --> 56:54.633
It's not funny at all.

57:59.488 --> 58:00.739
Bill.

58:02.116 --> 58:06.495
- Hi. The generator is okay.
- I thought I heard a scream.

58:06.661 --> 58:10.623
- How can you hear in that wind?
- It sounded like Brenda.

58:10.832 --> 58:12.125
I'd better look.

58:12.333 --> 58:15.795
Somebody turned on the lights
at the archery range.

58:18.173 --> 58:19.966
I can't see anything.

58:20.842 --> 58:22.719
They're off now.

58:23.678 --> 58:25.722
I'm gonna check it out.

58:26.264 --> 58:30.727
- Bill. Can I come?
- Come on.

58:34.022 --> 58:35.398
Brenda!

58:36.149 --> 58:37.776
Brenda!

58:43.114 --> 58:44.824
Where is she?

58:46.618 --> 58:49.287
She must be with Jack and Marcie.

58:52.415 --> 58:54.292
- Alice?
- Yeah?

58:54.459 --> 58:55.752
Come here.

59:15.312 --> 59:18.398
What is going on?

59:21.985 --> 59:23.237
Come on!

59:29.701 --> 59:33.747
- Jack, open the door.
- Jack.

59:36.375 --> 59:41.547
- Where are they?
- I don't know. Come on.

59:45.092 --> 59:46.635
Brenda?

59:47.845 --> 59:49.303
Marcie?

59:50.555 --> 59:55.393
Jack? Neddy?

59:59.981 --> 01:00:02.650
Bill, I think we should call someone.

01:00:03.317 --> 01:00:05.570
If this is a joke, I'll brain them!

01:00:05.778 --> 01:00:10.491
I'm serious.
I really think we should call someone.

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:20.835
The sucker's locked.

01:00:21.043 --> 01:00:23.087
- Where's the key?
- I don't know.

01:00:23.254 --> 01:00:24.797
Wait a minute.

01:00:33.848 --> 01:00:35.558
Watch out.

01:00:40.187 --> 01:00:41.646
Be careful.

01:00:43.732 --> 01:00:45.358
Let me get the light.

01:00:53.366 --> 01:00:54.993
What's wrong?

01:00:55.535 --> 01:00:58.038
It's dead. Try the pay phone.

01:00:58.246 --> 01:01:00.540
Do you have a dime or a quarter?

01:01:01.082 --> 01:01:02.876
No. Check the desk.

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:12.844
Hello?

01:01:13.428 --> 01:01:15.639
This damn thing's dead too!

01:01:31.237 --> 01:01:33.239
What's the matter with it?

01:01:33.447 --> 01:01:34.907
It's wet.

01:01:35.074 --> 01:01:36.075
I don't know.

01:01:36.283 --> 01:01:39.954
Why don't we just hike out of here?
Get out. Right now!

01:01:40.162 --> 01:01:43.749
It's 10 miles to the nearest crossroads.
Steve will be back soon.

01:01:43.958 --> 01:01:47.294
We can use his jeep if we need
to get help. Don't worry.

01:01:47.461 --> 01:01:51.090
- There's some stupid explanation for this.
- Like what?

01:01:51.298 --> 01:01:55.010
We'll be laughing about this tomorrow,
I promise.

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:00.057
Let's get out of the rain.

01:02:05.146 --> 01:02:10.025
It's not bad enough to have Friday the
13th, we've gotta have a full moon too.

01:02:10.234 --> 01:02:15.030
We keep statistics. We have more
accidents, more rapes, more robberies...

01:02:15.197 --> 01:02:18.909
...more homicides, more of everything
when there's a full moon.

01:02:19.118 --> 01:02:21.786
It upsets people. Makes them nuts.

01:02:21.995 --> 01:02:24.747
You're making science
out of coincidence.

01:02:26.624 --> 01:02:29.461
I hear Ralph was out your way today.

01:02:29.669 --> 01:02:32.672
His wife was a nervous wreck
until we got him home.

01:02:32.881 --> 01:02:36.217
That's all I need,
Crazy Ralph running around.

01:02:36.426 --> 01:02:38.678
Well, the rain's stopping.

01:02:39.762 --> 01:02:41.556
It was a pisser while it lasted.

01:02:41.764 --> 01:02:45.435
<i>Sgt. Tierney, come in.
Sgt. Tierney, Car Niner.</i>

01:02:46.603 --> 01:02:47.979
This is Tierney.

01:02:48.146 --> 01:02:52.984
<i>Rescue squad with Jaws of Life.
Near mile-marker 17. Possible fatals.</i>

01:02:53.193 --> 01:02:55.570
<i>Three, maybe more, trapped.
Head on.</i>

01:02:55.779 --> 01:03:00.074
Roger. Acknowledge receipt.
Estimate arrival, 15 minutes.

01:03:09.876 --> 01:03:12.878
- I have to let you off here.
- Sure.

01:03:13.879 --> 01:03:15.088
Thanks.

01:03:15.297 --> 01:03:17.007
Good luck.

01:03:56.171 --> 01:03:57.631
Who is that?

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.138
What are you doing
out in this mess?

01:05:26.843 --> 01:05:28.970
What do you think happened?

01:05:29.346 --> 01:05:31.139
I don't know.

01:05:32.432 --> 01:05:35.185
The generator's probably out of gas.

01:05:35.393 --> 01:05:37.354
I'll go check it.

01:05:38.605 --> 01:05:40.857
Do you want me to come with you?

01:05:41.775 --> 01:05:44.860
Why don't you stay here
and try and sleep.

01:05:46.028 --> 01:05:47.321
I'll be right back.

01:07:18.161 --> 01:07:19.537
Full of gas.

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:06.542
Generator.

01:14:13.818 --> 01:14:16.403
What am I gonna do?

01:15:28.266 --> 01:15:30.560
Please! Oh, please!

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.273
Who are you?

01:15:36.107 --> 01:15:39.611
I'm Mrs. Voorhees.
An old friend of the Christys.

01:15:42.572 --> 01:15:44.449
No, no. There, there.

01:15:44.657 --> 01:15:47.327
I can't help you
if you don't calm down.

01:15:47.494 --> 01:15:52.248
But she's dead and he's dead.
Oh, my God! Poor Bill! Oh, God!

01:15:52.457 --> 01:15:55.793
- All right. Come on, dear. Show me.
- No. No!

01:15:55.959 --> 01:16:01.048
It's all right. I'll take care of you.
I used to work for the Christys.

01:16:01.256 --> 01:16:03.592
What's going on?
Help me get out of here!

01:16:03.801 --> 01:16:07.387
It's this place and the storm.
That's why you're upset.

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:10.516
No, no! They're all dead!
They're all dead!

01:16:10.682 --> 01:16:13.685
- All right. I'll go look.
- Don't leave me!

01:16:13.852 --> 01:16:15.646
They'll kill you too!

01:16:15.854 --> 01:16:17.981
I'm not afraid.

01:16:36.041 --> 01:16:39.294
Oh, my Lord!

01:16:40.295 --> 01:16:42.297
So young.

01:16:42.548 --> 01:16:44.174
So pretty.

01:16:45.217 --> 01:16:47.301
What monster could have done this?

01:16:48.761 --> 01:16:50.972
Bill is out there!

01:16:51.806 --> 01:16:54.809
Oh, God, this place!

01:16:55.226 --> 01:16:58.312
Steve should never have
opened this place again!

01:16:58.521 --> 01:17:01.065
There's been too much trouble here.

01:17:01.941 --> 01:17:04.235
Did you know a young boy drowned?

01:17:04.444 --> 01:17:07.029
The year before those two others
were killed.

01:17:07.238 --> 01:17:09.657
The counselors weren't paying attention!

01:17:09.866 --> 01:17:13.536
They were making love
while that young boy drowned!

01:17:14.829 --> 01:17:17.165
His name was Jason.

01:17:18.833 --> 01:17:22.253
I was working the day it happened.
Preparing meals.

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:24.922
Here. I was the cook.

01:17:25.131 --> 01:17:28.217
Jason should have been watched!
Every minute!

01:17:28.426 --> 01:17:30.052
He was...

01:17:33.097 --> 01:17:35.850
He wasn't a very good swimmer.

01:17:37.976 --> 01:17:40.520
We can go now, dear.

01:17:40.854 --> 01:17:44.107
I think we should wait for Mr. Christy.

01:17:44.274 --> 01:17:46.359
That's not necessary.

01:17:46.568 --> 01:17:48.361
I don't understand.

01:17:49.488 --> 01:17:51.364
Help me!

01:17:51.573 --> 01:17:52.866
Help!

01:17:53.074 --> 01:17:54.326
Help, Mommy!

01:17:54.534 --> 01:17:57.537
Help! Help, Mommy!

01:17:58.538 --> 01:18:00.707
I am, Jason.

01:18:01.041 --> 01:18:02.042
I am.

01:18:05.212 --> 01:18:08.131
You see, Jason was my son.

01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:10.884
And today is his birthday.

01:18:11.093 --> 01:18:13.553
Where's Mr. Christy?

01:18:13.762 --> 01:18:16.765
I couldn't let them open this place again.

01:18:16.932 --> 01:18:18.558
Could I?

01:18:19.184 --> 01:18:21.311
Not after what happened.

01:18:25.148 --> 01:18:28.818
Oh, my sweet, innocent Jason.

01:18:29.819 --> 01:18:32.154
My only child.

01:18:32.738 --> 01:18:33.864
Jason.

01:18:38.744 --> 01:18:40.371
You let him drown!

01:18:40.579 --> 01:18:43.666
You never paid any attention!

01:18:43.833 --> 01:18:46.752
Look what you did to him!

01:18:46.961 --> 01:18:51.173
Look what you did to him!

01:19:52.942 --> 01:19:56.196
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her!

01:20:00.075 --> 01:20:04.120
Don't let her get away, Mommy.
Don't let her live!

01:20:04.287 --> 01:20:08.333
I won't, Jason. I won't!

01:20:57.631 --> 01:20:59.841
Where are the goddamn bullets?

01:21:16.023 --> 01:21:17.150
Come, dear.

01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:21.863
It will be easier for you
than it was for Jason.

01:21:24.949 --> 01:21:28.661
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her!

01:21:30.747 --> 01:21:32.123
Kill her.

01:23:09.176 --> 01:23:12.096
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her.

01:23:12.388 --> 01:23:16.016
She can't hide.
No place to hide.

01:23:16.225 --> 01:23:19.061
Get her, Mommy. Get her!

01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:21.564
Kill her! Kill her.

01:27:51.911 --> 01:27:53.955
Get off me!

01:31:02.599 --> 01:31:05.268
Ten milligrams, Valium.
It's all right.

01:31:05.477 --> 01:31:07.604
It's all over. Everything's over.

01:31:10.856 --> 01:31:13.192
Roll over. Roll over, dear.

01:31:33.712 --> 01:31:36.006
Your folks are on the way up.

01:31:38.759 --> 01:31:41.011
Is anyone else alive?

01:31:42.513 --> 01:31:44.390
Are they all dead?

01:31:44.849 --> 01:31:46.475
Yes, ma'am.

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:52.481
Two of my men pulled you out of the lake.
We thought you were dead too.

01:31:53.399 --> 01:31:55.651
Do you remember very much?

01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:57.403
The boy.

01:31:57.570 --> 01:31:59.613
Is he dead too?

01:31:59.864 --> 01:32:03.366
- Who?
- The boy, Jason.

01:32:04.826 --> 01:32:05.869
Jason?

01:32:06.077 --> 01:32:11.040
In the lake. The one who attacked me.
The one who pulled me under the water.

01:32:12.876 --> 01:32:16.463
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

01:32:18.256 --> 01:32:19.883
But he...

01:32:26.264 --> 01:32:28.933
Then he's still there.
