WEBVTT

02:17.570 --> 02:19.505
- I'm at the corner of
Pacific and Franklin.

02:19.506 --> 02:23.676
I have a possible 283, east
side of Pacific, black SUV.

02:25.111 --> 02:26.111
Copy that.

03:20.967 --> 03:21.967
Aah.

05:46.546 --> 05:47.814
- That's good.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.092
Hey buddy, wake up.

06:01.928 --> 06:02.928
You okay?

06:04.263 --> 06:05.698
- Yeah, I'm fine.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.771
- See what we got goin' on here.

06:12.638 --> 06:13.638
Ah, yeah.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.142
That'll work.

06:19.645 --> 06:21.547
Let's see what this is.

06:29.589 --> 06:33.025
I'm gonna get some
help, come right back.

07:36.722 --> 07:40.425
- You know we coulda
done this online, right?

07:40.426 --> 07:42.494
- Yeah, I like to
meet face-to-face,

07:42.495 --> 07:45.598
get a handle on who
I'm dealing with.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.700
Say you got three
million of these.

07:48.701 --> 07:52.872
- Yeah, department store
security is a bad joke, so...

07:53.906 --> 07:55.774
- You hacked it yourself?

07:55.775 --> 07:58.710
- Mean, yeah, it was mostly me.

07:58.711 --> 08:00.779
- Do I get to meet
your partners?

08:00.780 --> 08:03.850
- Maybe, let's see the cash.

08:21.868 --> 08:22.702
- Deal's off.

08:22.703 --> 08:23.969
- Wait, what the fuck?

08:23.970 --> 08:24.904
Let me see that.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.371
- Sorry, gotta run.

08:26.372 --> 08:30.309
- You've seen the numbers
man, we gotta do this.

08:31.677 --> 08:32.943
- Is that so?

08:32.945 --> 08:34.212
- You've been askin' for
this meeting for weeks.

08:34.212 --> 08:36.147
I go through all this
trouble, and you bail?

08:36.148 --> 08:40.284
No, no, I showed you the data
man, now give me the cash.

08:40.285 --> 08:42.388
- Doesn't work like that.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.525
- Sit the fuck down.

08:54.133 --> 08:55.534
- Do you know what
Occcam's Razor is?

08:55.535 --> 08:57.770
- Fuck you, the money, now.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.873
- It's a philosophical idea
that the simplest answer

09:01.874 --> 09:04.043
is by far the most likely.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.214
That's a nice gun, H and K UPS.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.816
Chambered in 47.

09:11.951 --> 09:14.120
Austrian, expensive, rare.

09:16.155 --> 09:17.722
Now what's more likely,

09:17.723 --> 09:20.692
a small time hacker working
out of a dilapidated warehouse

09:20.693 --> 09:24.864
has four grand and some serious
gun-running connections,

09:26.565 --> 09:30.736
or you ordered an airsoft
replica off Amazon for 50 bucks?

09:34.640 --> 09:37.042
I'm gonna do you
a real big favor

09:37.043 --> 09:40.212
and forget you pointed
that gun at me.

09:43.549 --> 09:45.551
Don't make me regret it.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.081
- Ah, Special Agent
Corbin, I'm Samantha Vera,

10:16.082 --> 10:18.383
I'm suppose to escort
you to the scene.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.118
- You have ID, Agent Vera?

10:20.119 --> 10:21.354
- Yeah, um.

10:27.159 --> 10:28.560
- Then let's go.

10:28.561 --> 10:29.795
- Right, let's.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.904
Can I just say Agent Corbin,

10:39.905 --> 10:44.076
I'm really sorry about
Francesco, I know
he was your boss.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.011
- Belt.

10:47.179 --> 10:48.180
- Excuse me?

10:49.315 --> 10:51.116
- Your seat belt
Agent Vera, put it on.

10:51.117 --> 10:52.117
- Oh.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.794
- How long have
you been with us?

11:02.795 --> 11:04.763
- Ah, well, I wish I
could still use that whole

11:04.764 --> 11:07.632
"it's my first day excuse,"
but it's getting kind of old.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.634
Almost a year.

11:09.635 --> 11:10.635
And you?

11:11.704 --> 11:12.937
- And me what?

11:12.938 --> 11:15.440
- How long have you
been with the bureau?

11:15.441 --> 11:16.542
- Nine years.

11:18.411 --> 11:21.247
- How long did you
know Francesco?

11:24.550 --> 11:25.618
- Nine years.

11:29.488 --> 11:31.689
What'd they tell you?

11:31.690 --> 11:33.491
- Francesco had a heart
attack on the way to work

11:33.492 --> 11:37.430
and was pronounced dead
on scene by paramedics.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.635
What was he carrying?

11:44.103 --> 11:47.739
- What makes you think he
was carrying something?

11:47.740 --> 11:50.642
- They took you out
of an undercover
operation to ID a body,

11:50.643 --> 11:53.144
I mean, if we're
running red lights

11:53.145 --> 11:54.279
on the way to a heart attack

11:54.280 --> 11:57.782
there must be
something else in play.

11:57.783 --> 12:00.251
- Francesco may
have had a package.

12:00.252 --> 12:03.521
That's what we're
there to find out.

12:03.522 --> 12:04.523
- Copy that.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.993
- What'd you do before you
joined us Special Agent Vera?

12:08.994 --> 12:11.596
- I was with the Secret Service.

12:11.597 --> 12:13.565
Uniform division, someone
thought I was big enough

12:13.566 --> 12:15.401
to make a good shield.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.370
- So why'd you transfer?

12:19.738 --> 12:21.639
- My dad was with the
Secret Service for 20 years,

12:21.640 --> 12:24.275
and I watched the
doubt eat him up.

12:24.276 --> 12:25.910
- What doubt?

12:25.911 --> 12:28.780
- Doubt about where
the bad guys are.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.315
The way politics
are going these days

12:30.316 --> 12:34.752
I was gonna have to take a
bullet for some sexist asshole.

12:34.753 --> 12:38.123
FBI, cyber crime, it's
the future, right?

12:38.124 --> 12:39.791
- As opposed to?

12:39.792 --> 12:43.228
- Cyber crime's about
data, and data doesn't lie.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.563
- Think I knew your father.

12:45.564 --> 12:49.067
- I know you did, he
told me about you.

12:49.068 --> 12:50.068
We're here.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.814
- I'm gonna have to ask
you folks to step back,

13:02.815 --> 13:04.282
this is a crime scene.

13:04.283 --> 13:08.753
- I'm Special Agent Corbin,
this is Agent Vera, FBI.

13:08.754 --> 13:11.623
- This is an NYPD crime scene,

13:11.624 --> 13:14.425
but I'll let ya talk
to my supervisor.

13:14.426 --> 13:15.994
- The deceased was
an agent of ours,

13:15.995 --> 13:17.662
we're here to secure
his belongings.

13:17.663 --> 13:19.697
- Well in that case
you're outta luck.

13:19.698 --> 13:22.667
Somebody already
stole his belongings.

13:22.668 --> 13:24.169
- Well, that changes things.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.303
- How so?

13:25.304 --> 13:26.571
- It's now a
federal crime scene,

13:26.572 --> 13:29.808
I'm gonna have to
ask you to step back.

13:59.138 --> 14:00.973
- Special Agent Corbin.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.175
- Yes?

14:04.176 --> 14:06.311
- They're asking
for you in the van.

14:06.312 --> 14:07.312
- What van?

14:11.817 --> 14:15.320
- Agent Corbin, Michael
Gates, Homeland Security.

14:15.321 --> 14:18.423
This is Mr. Blake, he's
observing from another agency.

14:18.424 --> 14:19.891
- You guys got here quick.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.393
- Time is of the essence,
as I'm sure you know.

14:22.394 --> 14:23.862
- What else do we know?

14:23.863 --> 14:26.431
- We understand the deceased
was a federal agent,

14:26.432 --> 14:28.233
one of yours.

14:28.234 --> 14:31.035
- Agent Francesco was
head of cyber crimes unit.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.770
- Any idea what happened?

14:32.771 --> 14:34.572
- No blood, no obvious trauma.

14:34.573 --> 14:36.408
Could be heart attack.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.676
Why are you here?

14:38.677 --> 14:40.178
- 'Cuse me?

14:40.179 --> 14:41.879
- I'm here because my boss
is lying dead in the street.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.314
You pressed the panic button

14:43.315 --> 14:45.650
and got a mobile command
post set up in under an hour.

14:45.651 --> 14:47.118
- It's a good question.

14:47.119 --> 14:49.287
Do you know what
Francesco was working on?

14:49.288 --> 14:51.022
- I can't tell you that.

14:51.023 --> 14:53.024
- Because you don't know.

14:53.025 --> 14:54.292
- How do you know that?

14:54.293 --> 14:57.262
- Because I told him
not to tell anyone.

14:57.263 --> 15:00.064
Agent Francesco was
carrying a package,

15:00.065 --> 15:02.166
it seems to be missing.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.302
- What'd this package contain?

15:04.303 --> 15:06.971
- Something that
needs to be found.

15:06.972 --> 15:09.073
That's all I can
tell you right now.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.275
- I know you work in politics,

15:10.276 --> 15:11.509
and your bosses are allergic

15:11.510 --> 15:12.478
to anything they
might have to deny

15:12.479 --> 15:13.745
in front of a Senate inquiry,

15:13.746 --> 15:15.713
but I need to know what
it was so I can work out

15:15.714 --> 15:18.950
who took it and
how to find them.

15:18.951 --> 15:22.221
- Have you ever heard
of Brooklyn Tide?

15:23.255 --> 15:24.689
- No.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.125
- It's an anarchist hacker
group that was originally formed

15:27.126 --> 15:29.727
to monitor government
wiretapping.

15:29.728 --> 15:31.429
It seems that in the last year

15:31.430 --> 15:34.799
they've metastasized into
something much more radical.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.301
- You think they're involved?

15:36.302 --> 15:38.002
- We've been monitoring
them as a potential threat

15:38.003 --> 15:39.437
for some time.

15:39.438 --> 15:42.240
Past few weeks, the chatter's
been off the charts.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.175
And today, total silence.

15:44.176 --> 15:48.279
Communication blackout one hour
before Francesco went down.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.281
- Could be a coincidence.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.649
- We're hoping for the best,

15:51.650 --> 15:55.186
but we're preparing
for the worst.

15:55.187 --> 15:56.421
- What'd Francesco have on him

15:56.422 --> 15:58.756
that these people wanted?

15:58.757 --> 16:00.558
- Something we can't
afford to lose.

16:00.559 --> 16:01.793
- I need more than that.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.195
- We're not playing
politics Agent Corbin.

16:04.196 --> 16:06.364
I'd need direct authorization
from the President

16:06.365 --> 16:09.434
in order to tell you what
Agent Francesco was carrying.

16:09.435 --> 16:10.902
- We're workin' on it.

16:10.903 --> 16:14.472
- In the meantime, just
know that it must be found.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.140
- Can you tell me
what size it was?

16:16.141 --> 16:17.076
Was it a briefcase?

16:17.077 --> 16:18.609
- It's digital.

16:18.610 --> 16:21.312
- So it's something
small like a thumb drive.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.547
- Yes.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.749
- Then this could still
be a random robbery?

16:24.750 --> 16:25.983
- Which is why there
aren't roadblocks

16:25.984 --> 16:28.252
and a sky full a helicopters.

16:28.253 --> 16:29.887
Can't have people
asking questions,

16:29.888 --> 16:31.589
this has to be handled quietly.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.124
- If this was a
targeted operation,

16:33.125 --> 16:35.993
they have to authenticate
what they've taken.

16:35.994 --> 16:39.263
We're monitoring all data
locations, public and private,

16:39.264 --> 16:40.432
within miles.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.068
- Take this, it's secure.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.403
We can monitor your position

16:45.404 --> 16:48.506
and give you information
as you need it.

16:48.507 --> 16:52.678
Watch your six Corbin, we
already lost one agent today.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.054
- We're leaving?

17:02.055 --> 17:03.554
- Yes.

17:03.555 --> 17:04.922
- What'd they say?

17:04.923 --> 17:06.457
- Do you live around here?

17:06.458 --> 17:07.458
- Yes.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.926
- Say you need to
use the internet

17:09.928 --> 17:11.762
but you knew it was being
monitored, where would you go?

17:11.763 --> 17:13.598
- I'd go to a cafe,
they all have wi-fi

17:13.598 --> 17:14.766
and they're anonymous.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.367
- Within walking
distance of the scene.

17:16.367 --> 17:20.438
Cafe big enough to hide
in with multiple exits.

17:20.439 --> 17:22.708
- Definitely Cafe Mongoose.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.675
Are we getting coffee?

17:25.676 --> 17:26.744
- I guess so.

18:03.715 --> 18:06.117
- So do I get to know
what's going on here?

18:06.118 --> 18:08.653
- Certain government agencies
have lost something important

18:08.654 --> 18:10.054
and we're gonna get it back.

18:10.055 --> 18:11.389
- What did they lose?

18:11.390 --> 18:12.890
- They won't tell us.

18:12.891 --> 18:14.959
Francesco had it on him
when he left this morning,

18:14.960 --> 18:16.093
now he doesn't.

18:16.094 --> 18:18.729
- So someone killed him for it.

18:18.730 --> 18:19.898
- Possibility.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.672
- What else did they tell you?

18:27.673 --> 18:29.707
- What's your
security clearance?

18:29.708 --> 18:32.544
- Three, almost,
three-and-a-half.

18:33.979 --> 18:37.348
- They have half levels
of security clearance now?

18:37.349 --> 18:41.286
- Four, I have a level
four security clearance.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.557
Is this gonna be
like Training Day?

18:46.558 --> 18:48.526
- You think I'm gonna trick
you into smoking crack

18:48.527 --> 18:50.761
then get you to help
me rob a drug dealer?

18:50.762 --> 18:53.098
- No I mean, is this a test?

18:54.032 --> 18:55.800
- Yes, a test.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.236
That's the problem with having
so many federal agencies,

18:58.237 --> 19:00.906
jurisdiction gives
the game away.

19:02.274 --> 19:05.810
- Secret Service,
CIA, State Department,

19:05.811 --> 19:08.479
even the DOE have
their own people.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.614
- There's one government agency

19:09.615 --> 19:11.349
that can't operate on U.S. soil

19:11.350 --> 19:14.252
without congressional approval.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.254
- The Pentagon.

19:16.255 --> 19:19.490
- Pentagon doesn't solve
crimes, or collect secrets,

19:19.491 --> 19:21.659
they fight wars.

19:21.660 --> 19:25.664
- So, it's a weapon, it's
a weapon made of code.

19:27.032 --> 19:28.833
- If they knew to steal it,

19:28.834 --> 19:31.569
we have to assume they
know how to use it,

19:31.570 --> 19:35.007
or intend to sell it
to someone who will.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.189
Looks like we were
right, drive's here.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.191
- Funny place to
start world war three.

19:54.192 --> 19:55.560
How do you wanna do this?

19:55.561 --> 19:56.995
- Follow my lead.

20:10.909 --> 20:12.143
- Hi, what can I get you?

20:12.144 --> 20:13.244
- Coffee, black.

20:13.245 --> 20:14.179
- Sure.

20:14.179 --> 20:14.980
- Who are we looking for?

20:14.981 --> 20:17.348
- Something outta place.

20:17.349 --> 20:18.549
I'm gonna get their attention,

20:18.550 --> 20:21.887
watch and see if
anyone doesn't look up.

20:23.255 --> 20:24.889
Federal agents, I
need you to stop

20:24.890 --> 20:27.226
what you're doing right now.

20:48.780 --> 20:51.649
Someone who was just here on a
laptop, I need a description.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.986
Ask the girl at the counter.

20:58.724 --> 20:59.958
- Shit, Corbin.

21:00.826 --> 21:01.826
- Shit.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.133
- Which way?

21:09.134 --> 21:10.968
- If she had a car it
would've been waiting.

21:10.969 --> 21:12.804
Subway's too far away.

21:13.772 --> 21:14.773
The shuttle.

21:30.322 --> 21:32.056
- That was really great
what you did in there.

21:32.057 --> 21:33.424
- It was procedure.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.359
- No procedure I've ever read.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.328
- It's in there, trust me.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.130
- You know all the rules?

21:39.131 --> 21:40.731
- We're agents of the
United States government,

21:40.732 --> 21:42.466
we enforce laws.

21:42.467 --> 21:46.003
We don't get to make
things up as we go along.

21:46.004 --> 21:47.905
- Like Agent Clay?

21:47.906 --> 21:50.041
- You don't know anything
about Johnathan Clay.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.410
- We did a case study
on him in the academy.

21:52.411 --> 21:54.879
Most decorated agent in
the bureau until he turned.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.147
- Wasn't a traitor.

21:56.148 --> 21:59.116
He was a good man trying
to do the right thing.

21:59.117 --> 22:01.118
- Text book says otherwise.

22:01.119 --> 22:04.356
- Clay never saved
the textbook's life.

22:28.447 --> 22:29.381
- Shall we grab her?

22:29.382 --> 22:31.549
No, she's just a courier.

22:31.550 --> 22:33.818
I'm gonna find out who
she gives the drive to.

22:33.819 --> 22:35.486
- Protocol?

22:35.487 --> 22:36.487
- Yes.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.762
- How did Clay save your life?

22:44.763 --> 22:46.263
- It's not important.

22:46.264 --> 22:47.866
- I'd like to know.

22:49.935 --> 22:52.269
- We're on a raid,
an all-Russian crew,

22:52.270 --> 22:54.939
I got distracted and
suspect got the drop on me.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.108
- Wha'd he do?

22:57.242 --> 22:58.576
- Jumped in front of it.

22:58.577 --> 22:59.944
Took two in the
vest, spun around,

22:59.945 --> 23:01.345
shot the guy right in the face.

23:01.346 --> 23:03.347
- So he was good.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.015
- Depends on what
you mean by good,

23:05.016 --> 23:08.620
but yeah, he's the best
I ever worked with.

23:10.055 --> 23:14.191
- And would you've done the
same, I mean as Clay did?

23:14.192 --> 23:15.626
- I ask myself that a lot.

23:15.627 --> 23:16.627
- And.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.834
- If it was me, probably
would've stood there

23:23.835 --> 23:28.239
with a dumb look on my
face and watched him die.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.508
- Remind me not to
piss off any Russians.

23:30.509 --> 23:31.443
- We're not partners.

23:31.444 --> 23:32.677
- We are today.

23:48.393 --> 23:49.427
- Where are you?

23:49.428 --> 23:50.961
- We are watching.

23:50.962 --> 23:53.330
- Get me out of here, this
was not part of the plan.

23:53.331 --> 23:54.932
- It is under control.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.200
- Under control?

23:56.201 --> 23:58.502
I have two federal
agents chasing after me.

23:58.503 --> 23:59.770
Send someone to
pick up this thing

23:59.771 --> 24:01.739
or I'm gonna drop it
down the storm drain.

24:01.740 --> 24:04.441
- The FBI has
rules they must abide by.

24:04.442 --> 24:05.277
- What is that suppose to mean?

24:05.278 --> 24:06.811
- We do not.

24:06.812 --> 24:10.949
If you fail, the law will be
the least of your problems.

24:13.251 --> 24:14.585
- Well then get me out of here.

24:14.586 --> 24:16.387
- The next
building on the right,

24:16.388 --> 24:17.823
wait by the door.

24:23.328 --> 24:25.529
- She's gone into that building.

24:25.530 --> 24:27.531
- No, she's waiting
in the entrance.

24:27.532 --> 24:28.732
Cross the street
and walk past her.

24:28.733 --> 24:31.468
Tell me if she's gone inside.

24:31.469 --> 24:32.871
Put your coms in.

24:36.908 --> 24:38.510
- Wait.

24:41.913 --> 24:42.913
- Hurry.

24:44.649 --> 24:48.485
- Do you ever go to visit
him, in prison I mean?

24:48.486 --> 24:49.487
- Visit who?

24:50.555 --> 24:51.555
- Clay.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.192
- Wait.

24:55.193 --> 24:56.428
- They're here.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.630
- No, any more
personal questions,

24:59.631 --> 25:01.900
or can we go save the world?

25:03.401 --> 25:05.369
- Ready when you are.

25:05.370 --> 25:07.138
- I'm going.

25:12.878 --> 25:15.046
- Shit, she's gone inside.

25:45.110 --> 25:47.444
- Go around, there's
gotta be a way through.

25:47.445 --> 25:51.081
She has to be, get
to the station, I'll
try from this side.

25:51.082 --> 25:53.652
Federal agents, open the door.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.088
Where are you?

29:25.330 --> 29:26.864
There's a tunnel leading to 545,

29:26.865 --> 29:29.366
she's making for the front door.

29:29.367 --> 29:30.368
- I'm on it.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.706
- What's your position?

30:09.707 --> 30:10.807
- I have the
main entrance covered.

30:10.808 --> 30:11.743
- Do you have visual?

30:11.744 --> 30:13.178
- Nothing.

30:17.715 --> 30:18.650
- Where are you?

30:18.650 --> 30:19.450
- I'm by the front door.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.386
- I just came out of it.

30:22.787 --> 30:23.787
- Damn.

30:26.157 --> 30:27.392
- Where is she?

30:30.461 --> 30:31.461
- There.

31:07.865 --> 31:09.333
- Stay here, wait
for the next one.

31:09.334 --> 31:10.968
- What're you gonna do?

31:10.969 --> 31:13.504
- I'm gonna stop that train.

32:24.309 --> 32:27.611
This is Agent Jonathan
Corbin, authorization 78786.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.880
I need you to cut
power to grid 82.

32:29.881 --> 32:31.616
All the high voltage.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.786
They'll have backup power.

32:36.054 --> 32:37.387
No, you need to do
what I'm telling you

32:37.388 --> 32:39.923
or you lose your job.

32:39.924 --> 32:42.660
Throw the switch
or go to prison.

32:47.098 --> 32:48.799
- Attention,
due to a power outage,

32:48.800 --> 32:53.705
this train is being held
here until further notice.

33:59.937 --> 34:00.937
- Yeah.

34:01.806 --> 34:04.409
Oh just everything,
where are you?

34:07.612 --> 34:10.813
I didn't know who
else to reach out to.

34:10.815 --> 34:12.681
Look, I tried to
do something right

34:12.683 --> 34:15.620
and now it's just
all gone to hell.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.324
Oh that's so easy
for you to say.

34:26.531 --> 34:27.531
Really?

34:30.333 --> 34:31.333
Thank you.

34:35.005 --> 34:36.005
I gotta go.

34:48.686 --> 34:49.754
- Hey.

34:57.094 --> 34:57.929
- Any sign of her?

34:57.930 --> 34:58.930
- No, I just got here.

34:58.930 --> 34:59.764
- What about comin' up Franklin?

34:59.765 --> 35:01.665
- No, nothing.

35:01.666 --> 35:03.400
Shit, the museum,
there's a festival,

35:03.401 --> 35:05.535
she'll try and lose
us in the crowd.

35:05.536 --> 35:07.838
Should we call in NYPD so
we have more bodies on hand

35:07.839 --> 35:10.774
so we're not running
ourselves ragged?

35:10.775 --> 35:13.143
- No, once they get
wind of a terror threat

35:13.144 --> 35:14.911
they'll come in guns blazing,

35:14.912 --> 35:16.813
we'll never get to
ID who she's meeting.

35:16.814 --> 35:18.315
- Assuming we find her.

35:18.316 --> 35:20.117
- We'll find her.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.319
She's scared, she's
in over her head,

35:22.320 --> 35:24.621
she'll call the people
who put her up to this.

35:24.622 --> 35:25.789
- What are you thinking?

35:25.790 --> 35:26.724
- About what?

35:26.725 --> 35:28.291
- About who we're dealing with.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.527
- Well it's a pretty
narrow subset of groups.

35:30.528 --> 35:33.864
U.S. has many enemies, not
many willing to wage war

35:33.865 --> 35:35.065
against a super power.

35:35.066 --> 35:37.300
- Iran, North Korea.

35:37.301 --> 35:38.735
- They'd use their own people.

35:38.736 --> 35:40.604
They'd never farm it
out to freelancers.

35:40.605 --> 35:42.339
- Which leaves...

35:42.340 --> 35:45.575
- Domestic threats,
anti-nuclear protesters,

35:45.576 --> 35:48.678
freedom of information
kooks, hackers for hire,

35:48.679 --> 35:51.114
soldiers of fortune,

35:51.115 --> 35:53.383
slag at the bottom
of the terror barrel.

35:53.384 --> 35:56.453
- What's the plan of attack?

35:56.454 --> 35:58.255
- Go to the museum control room,

35:58.256 --> 35:59.556
see what you can
find on the monitors.

35:59.557 --> 36:01.092
I'll flush her out.

36:08.165 --> 36:09.432
- Yes.

36:09.433 --> 36:10.934
- You were told to
stay on the train.

36:10.935 --> 36:13.236
- Hey, you're not the one
sticking their neck out.

36:13.237 --> 36:15.839
They pulled the power and
the whole train stopped.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.708
- Follow orders from now
on or you will be shot,

36:18.709 --> 36:20.211
do you understand?

36:22.246 --> 36:24.447
They're coming for
you from the east.

36:24.448 --> 36:28.119
Take your jacket off,
leave it on the floor.

37:18.169 --> 37:20.904
- Can we zoom in right here?

37:20.905 --> 37:22.939
Hey Corbin, can you hear me?

37:22.940 --> 37:24.941
Alright, we got
eyes on the crowd.

37:24.942 --> 37:26.043
- Yeah, copy.

37:28.713 --> 37:31.615
She must've changed clothes.

37:31.616 --> 37:32.816
- That's very sophisticated,

37:32.817 --> 37:35.051
think she has a
trade craft for that?

37:35.052 --> 37:36.653
- No, but someone
must be helping her

37:36.654 --> 37:38.788
or she never woulda
got this far.

37:38.789 --> 37:42.993
- She could've gone further
down Eastern Parkway.

37:42.994 --> 37:44.861
- She's here somewhere.

37:44.862 --> 37:47.098
She's gonna make a mistake.

38:01.979 --> 38:04.681
- Move two steps to your left.

38:04.682 --> 38:06.616
Do you see the
poster on the wall?

38:06.617 --> 38:08.351
You gotta walk
straight towards it.

38:08.352 --> 38:10.354
Do not move out of line.

38:11.255 --> 38:13.257
- I still can't see her.

38:14.225 --> 38:15.225
Wait.

38:15.926 --> 38:17.293
- What is it?

38:17.294 --> 38:19.964
- Black jacket in the forecourt.

38:24.201 --> 38:25.636
- Go.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.647
- What?

38:37.648 --> 38:38.748
- Where'd you get that jacket?

38:38.749 --> 38:40.751
- I found it, it's mine.

38:43.521 --> 38:46.523
- She has help, some one who
knows where the cameras are.

38:46.524 --> 38:47.524
Someone

38:48.626 --> 38:49.626
up high.

38:56.167 --> 39:00.337
- Walk under the stairs and
stop under the third pillar.

39:42.646 --> 39:43.581
- Uh, shit.

39:43.581 --> 39:44.581
- Cassie.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.286
- Shit, shit.

39:52.823 --> 39:54.290
I have to move.

39:54.291 --> 39:58.362
- Stay where
you are, you're safe there.

40:03.934 --> 40:04.769
- San just...

40:04.770 --> 40:06.136
- Hey.

40:06.137 --> 40:07.504
- Don't talk, just move.

40:07.505 --> 40:08.805
- Why, why?

40:08.806 --> 40:11.141
- God dammit, because
people are watching.

40:11.142 --> 40:12.142
- Alright we got her.

40:12.143 --> 40:13.309
She's lost the jacket,

40:13.310 --> 40:14.611
she's heading east
towards the gardens now

40:14.612 --> 40:18.315
accompanied by a
brown-skinned male, late 20s.

40:28.125 --> 40:29.492
Is this her contact?

40:29.493 --> 40:31.394
- Could be, doesn't
look it though.

40:31.395 --> 40:32.762
- But we should
grab them, right?

40:32.763 --> 40:34.264
- No, not yet.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.765
- I mean, he's the next
link in the chain, right?

40:35.766 --> 40:36.900
- Not necessarily.

40:36.901 --> 40:38.168
- Who else would she be meeting?

40:38.169 --> 40:40.537
- Someone she'd call
when she's in trouble.

40:40.538 --> 40:42.138
Damsel in distress.

40:42.139 --> 40:45.074
- So he's just some civilian
in the middle of this?

40:45.075 --> 40:47.577
- His body language, he's
totally focused on her,

40:47.578 --> 40:49.012
I don't think he
knows what's goin' on.

40:49.013 --> 40:50.213
Let's hang back.

40:50.214 --> 40:51.414
- It's gonna be packed,

40:51.415 --> 40:52.549
surveillance is
gonna be a nightmare.

40:52.550 --> 40:53.983
- We'll have more cover.

40:53.984 --> 40:56.286
- And if there's a shootout,
lots of bystanders.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.954
- It won't come to that.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.088
- I hate crowds.

40:59.089 --> 41:00.690
- Why?

41:00.691 --> 41:01.991
- Rallies were always
a nightmare for
the Secret Service.

41:01.992 --> 41:06.029
All those possible
threats, no mobility.

41:06.030 --> 41:08.231
- Dad must be very proud.

41:08.232 --> 41:11.601
- He's a tough man to please,
I'd need to get a medal.

41:11.602 --> 41:13.703
- It's not all it's
cracked up to be.

41:13.704 --> 41:15.039
Mainly politics.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.774
- Like Clay?

41:17.775 --> 41:20.877
You got a medal when
he went to prison.

41:20.878 --> 41:22.713
- Something like that.

41:23.581 --> 41:26.150
Every service needs its heroes.

41:27.017 --> 41:28.452
And its villains.

41:36.427 --> 41:38.328
- Tell me, what's goin' on?

41:38.329 --> 41:39.562
- What?

41:39.563 --> 41:40.364
- You ask me to come
here and get you,

41:40.365 --> 41:41.865
and now you get angry.

41:41.866 --> 41:44.367
- No, no, I'm not angry,
okay, things just changed.

41:44.368 --> 41:48.471
- What coulda changed
since five minutes ago?

41:48.472 --> 41:51.575
- More than you
would think, come on.

42:00.718 --> 42:05.455
Hey, I'm sorry, thank
you, thank you for coming.

42:05.456 --> 42:06.956
Really.

42:06.957 --> 42:09.125
- I missed you, I tried to
tell you that on the phone.

42:09.126 --> 42:10.694
- I missed you too.

42:11.996 --> 42:14.330
- Well you kinda just
sorta disappeared.

42:14.331 --> 42:15.565
I mean I know you
said you wanted space,

42:15.566 --> 42:17.600
but I mean one day we were happy

42:17.601 --> 42:19.369
and the next, you
were just gone.

42:19.370 --> 42:22.705
- I know, I thought I
met someone special.

42:22.706 --> 42:24.140
- And what?

42:24.141 --> 42:25.075
- What do you mean?

42:25.076 --> 42:26.476
- Are you still with him?

42:26.477 --> 42:28.745
- He wasn't who
I thought he was.

42:28.746 --> 42:31.414
- You didn't answer my question,
are you still with him?

42:31.415 --> 42:32.750
- No, it's over.

42:43.193 --> 42:46.629
- What are your
thoughts on the new guy?

42:46.630 --> 42:49.299
- What are yours?

42:49.300 --> 42:51.468
- Civilian, like you said.

42:52.670 --> 42:53.736
He's doing that
dumb walk guys do

42:53.737 --> 42:55.905
when they try to look tough.

42:55.906 --> 42:57.507
- Think that'll hurt or help us?

42:57.508 --> 42:58.775
- What do you mean?

42:58.776 --> 43:00.810
- Is he gonna fight
to protect her?

43:00.811 --> 43:03.713
- Are you asking my
opinion as an agent?

43:03.714 --> 43:05.316
- Or a woman, both.

43:06.216 --> 43:08.851
- Well, he thinks he will,

43:08.852 --> 43:11.721
but when it comes down to it,

43:11.722 --> 43:13.590
it depends on how
much he loves her,

43:13.591 --> 43:15.926
and how much he has to lose.

43:18.162 --> 43:19.595
- Faltering courage
of those who know

43:19.596 --> 43:21.265
they're too pretty
to go to prison.

43:22.900 --> 43:24.167
- Something like that.

43:24.168 --> 43:25.601
- You're young to be so cynical.

43:25.602 --> 43:27.870
- You're old to be so romantic.

43:27.871 --> 43:29.605
- I like to think I'm a realist.

43:29.606 --> 43:33.777
- Great, 'cause as us kids
say, this shit just got real.

43:38.682 --> 43:40.650
- What am I suppose to
just drop everything,

43:40.651 --> 43:41.884
and take you back?

43:41.885 --> 43:43.286
After what you did?

43:43.287 --> 43:45.054
- I'm not asking you
to forgive me but,

43:45.055 --> 43:46.756
just give me a chance.

43:46.757 --> 43:48.359
- A chance to what?

43:49.727 --> 43:52.396
- A chance to make things right.

43:59.136 --> 44:01.237
- Things can't be
like they were before.

44:01.238 --> 44:04.907
I don't even know if
I can trust you again.

44:04.908 --> 44:06.577
- It's okay, I know.

44:14.785 --> 44:16.152
Hey, hey, follow me.

44:16.153 --> 44:17.387
- Wait, what, what's goin' on?

44:17.388 --> 44:18.588
- These people are following me.

44:18.589 --> 44:20.823
- Who, is it him, is he here?

44:20.824 --> 44:22.425
- Just come on.

44:22.426 --> 44:24.161
- I'm not gonna hide.

44:26.797 --> 44:28.132
Apparently I am.

44:34.571 --> 44:36.472
- What is it?

44:36.473 --> 44:38.207
- Time to make a move.

44:38.208 --> 44:40.343
- The only other entrance
is a municipal parking lot,

44:40.344 --> 44:41.844
and it's sealed off.

44:41.845 --> 44:43.513
- Stay back and make sure
they don't get past me.

44:43.514 --> 44:45.148
I'll wait 'til they're
isolated and move in.

44:45.149 --> 44:47.251
- Copy that, standing by.

44:51.288 --> 44:53.823
- Wait, c'mon, Cassie stop.

44:53.824 --> 44:55.324
- Sanchez, come on.

44:55.325 --> 44:56.859
- Where are we goin'?

44:56.860 --> 44:59.430
Just talk to me, Cassie talk...

45:00.597 --> 45:01.398
- Here.

45:01.399 --> 45:02.498
- What're you...

45:02.499 --> 45:04.000
- In here.

45:04.001 --> 45:05.268
- Where're you goin', I'm
not hidin', listen stop.

45:05.269 --> 45:06.836
- No, Sanchez you
don't understand.

45:06.837 --> 45:09.338
- Look, bay, bay, bay, bay,
I can handle this, okay?

45:09.339 --> 45:11.140
- No Sanchez,...

45:11.141 --> 45:12.876
- Stay where you are.

45:14.778 --> 45:16.679
- What the fuck man,
get outta the way.

45:16.680 --> 45:19.749
- Don't make this any
harder than it is.

45:19.750 --> 45:21.684
- What're you not listening?

45:21.685 --> 45:24.854
She's not goin' with you man,
get the fuck out the way.

45:24.855 --> 45:25.922
- You're one bad decision away

45:25.923 --> 45:28.224
from making a very big mistake.

45:28.225 --> 45:29.959
- Oh really, why don't
you tell me about it,

45:29.960 --> 45:31.427
give me one good reason.

45:31.428 --> 45:33.529
- I can give you two.

45:33.530 --> 45:35.031
This a Glock 19,

45:35.032 --> 45:37.767
it'll put a hole in your
head the size of my fist.

45:37.768 --> 45:42.538
Second, is this badge, which
gives me full authority

45:42.539 --> 45:45.308
of the United States
Government to do so.

45:45.309 --> 45:47.677
- You didn't say your
boyfriend was a fed.

45:47.678 --> 45:48.612
- He's not...

45:48.613 --> 45:50.146
- It's not a personal matter,

45:50.147 --> 45:53.516
she has stolen top-secret
documents in her position.

45:53.517 --> 45:55.051
- Is that true?

45:55.052 --> 45:56.719
- I had it, but I already
gave it to somebody else.

45:56.720 --> 45:59.188
- Give it up, it's in your bag.

45:59.189 --> 46:00.389
- No.

46:00.390 --> 46:02.058
- Are you serious,
just give him the bag.

46:02.059 --> 46:02.893
- No.

46:02.894 --> 46:04.327
- You got 10 seconds.

46:04.328 --> 46:06.629
- Cassie, whoa, hey, I
didn't sign up for this man,

46:06.630 --> 46:07.864
alright just give him the bag.

46:07.865 --> 46:10.399
- But, no, is this you
handling the situation?

46:10.400 --> 46:11.934
- Handling the situation?

46:11.935 --> 46:13.136
You're using me, that's the
only reason why you called.

46:13.137 --> 46:14.370
Give him the bag.

46:14.371 --> 46:15.605
- What, you said you
would protect me.

46:15.606 --> 46:16.306
- Protect, you want
me to protect you?

46:16.307 --> 46:17.840
- Yes.

46:17.841 --> 46:19.075
- Wha'da you want me to get
shot, is that what you want?

46:19.076 --> 46:21.077
- One more second
and you'll find out.

46:21.078 --> 46:22.078
- Just fucking give
him the bag, c'mon.

46:22.079 --> 46:23.913
- No, no, Sanchez, Sanchez stop.

46:23.914 --> 46:25.448
- The fuckin' bag, here
you go, here you go.

46:25.449 --> 46:27.284
- Lock her to the bus.

46:29.353 --> 46:30.720
- No.
- You serious?

46:30.721 --> 46:32.122
- Do it.

46:34.491 --> 46:35.425
- This is ridiculous.

46:35.426 --> 46:36.426
- Do it.

46:36.427 --> 46:37.793
- What're you doing?

46:37.794 --> 46:38.961
- This is some sick shit.

46:38.962 --> 46:41.464
- Sanchez, Sanchez
stop, what're you doing?

46:41.465 --> 46:44.200
Come on, Sanchez
it's me, it's Cassie.

46:44.201 --> 46:45.035
- No, no.

46:45.035 --> 46:46.035
- Stop.

46:47.471 --> 46:48.538
C'mon.

46:48.539 --> 46:49.373
- I'm sorry.

46:49.373 --> 46:50.373
- Sanchez.

46:51.341 --> 46:52.276
- You're the one that
fuckin' called me

46:52.276 --> 46:53.210
to use me like you usually do.

46:53.210 --> 46:54.144
- Fuck you.

46:54.144 --> 46:55.078
- No, fuck you.

46:55.079 --> 46:56.612
- Get the fuck away from me.

46:56.613 --> 46:58.682
You're useless, fuck you.

47:01.652 --> 47:03.320
Oh come on, Sanchez.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.929
- I've got the drive.

47:13.564 --> 47:16.633
Do not engage,
repeat, do not engage.

47:18.101 --> 47:19.101
Copy that.

48:33.443 --> 48:34.443
- Oh.

48:56.233 --> 49:00.003
- Sh, sh, you're okay,
just breathe, breathe.

49:02.205 --> 49:03.873
You're alright.

49:03.874 --> 49:06.043
I'm gonna take this, okay?

49:15.152 --> 49:18.488
We made a great team,
I have to do this.

50:17.247 --> 50:21.251
- Sit down, unless you
wanna die like your boss.

50:35.699 --> 50:39.435
You were injected with
potassium cyanide.

50:39.436 --> 50:42.672
When it reaches your
heart, you'll die.

50:43.874 --> 50:45.542
I have the antidote.

50:47.444 --> 50:48.945
Try not to scream.

50:59.956 --> 51:02.591
There's a lot more goin'
on here than meets the eye.

51:02.592 --> 51:04.059
- Ya think.

51:04.060 --> 51:08.364
- Be quiet and listen, or
you'll give yourself a stroke.

51:08.365 --> 51:10.766
We've been monitoring Brooklyn
Tide for some time now

51:10.767 --> 51:14.570
because we thought they'd
turn someone inside the FBI.

51:14.571 --> 51:15.572
Now we know.

51:17.140 --> 51:19.508
- That's how they knew to...

51:19.509 --> 51:21.678
- Be quiet, just be quiet.

51:25.348 --> 51:28.951
Agent Vera showed her colors
and now the drive is gone.

51:28.952 --> 51:29.952
Again.

51:35.091 --> 51:38.595
It's a crime for me
to even tell you this,

51:40.030 --> 51:42.599
but the drive contains a virus

51:43.834 --> 51:46.603
that can destroy a
nuclear facility.

51:49.506 --> 51:54.310
We developed it to destroy
the Iranian nuclear program

51:54.311 --> 51:56.679
but it can penetrate and destroy

51:56.680 --> 52:00.484
any military or civilian
reactor in the world.

52:04.020 --> 52:06.255
Brooklyn Tide has grown
increasingly radical

52:06.256 --> 52:07.723
over the last two years.

52:07.724 --> 52:10.092
There was a large
influx of money,

52:10.093 --> 52:12.362
and a change in leadership.

52:13.797 --> 52:17.933
And the money is coming
directly from the cartels.

52:17.934 --> 52:18.934
- Mexico.

52:19.903 --> 52:22.572
- Specifically the Gulf cartel.

52:24.841 --> 52:26.742
For the past few
years the Gulf cartel

52:26.743 --> 52:30.914
has been beaten up badly
by their west coast rivals.

52:31.982 --> 52:34.250
The San Onofre
reactor in California

52:34.251 --> 52:36.653
sits directly on the border.

52:38.822 --> 52:40.456
- If there was incident we'd...

52:40.457 --> 52:44.393
- We'd have to evacuate San
Diego and close the border.

52:44.394 --> 52:48.531
The western cartel would
lose its pipeline for weeks,

52:48.532 --> 52:49.599
maybe months.

52:52.068 --> 52:54.671
- Who'd make a play like that?

52:56.006 --> 52:59.174
- Someone familiar
with our organizations,

52:59.175 --> 53:01.878
someone who
understands reactors.

53:02.946 --> 53:04.346
Someone who wants revenge,

53:04.347 --> 53:07.617
even at the risk of
millions of lives.

53:08.919 --> 53:10.020
- He's here.

53:15.425 --> 53:19.662
- We have the park locked
down as best we can.

53:19.663 --> 53:22.232
NYPD is taking up positions but

53:23.900 --> 53:27.904
by tomorrow this thing
could be troubling down.

53:29.573 --> 53:32.174
- I know where she
is, I can get it back.

53:32.175 --> 53:33.410
- Agent Corbin,

53:35.512 --> 53:36.947
make sure you do.

53:38.081 --> 53:40.684
This could be our last chance.

54:04.541 --> 54:06.909
- Well this is a nice surprise.

54:06.910 --> 54:08.210
- It's a surprise,

54:08.211 --> 54:10.646
I don't know if
I'd call it nice.

54:10.647 --> 54:11.881
- You're alive.

54:13.249 --> 54:16.952
That was a condition,
deal breaker.

54:16.953 --> 54:19.723
- Generous to the last.

54:20.857 --> 54:23.892
- Where are you,
still on the street?

54:23.893 --> 54:27.229
- Waiting in an ambulance.

54:27.230 --> 54:29.598
- No hard feelings, right.

54:29.599 --> 54:33.103
- Of course not, better man won.

54:36.106 --> 54:38.274
You look nice in a dress.

54:43.013 --> 54:44.546
- How are you...

54:44.547 --> 54:47.817
- No need for that, not here.

54:49.719 --> 54:50.753
- How are you...

54:50.754 --> 54:52.321
- Still walking?

54:52.322 --> 54:55.958
Maybe our mutual friend isn't
as clever as he thinks he is.

54:55.959 --> 54:57.794
Where'd you meet him?

55:01.031 --> 55:02.031
- Online.

55:03.199 --> 55:05.702
- He approached you?

55:08.204 --> 55:10.306
- I used to read his posts on
the law enforcement forums,

55:10.307 --> 55:12.341
we got to chatting.

55:12.342 --> 55:13.677
- When?

55:14.678 --> 55:16.179
- Since I was 14.

55:21.618 --> 55:23.886
You know you don't
sound so good.

55:23.887 --> 55:25.521
- It's been a rough day.

55:25.522 --> 55:27.589
- Feel like you've
been hit by a truck?

55:27.590 --> 55:29.258
- Not physically.

55:29.259 --> 55:30.726
When someone you trust...

55:30.727 --> 55:33.696
- You should ask our friend,
he knows all about that.

55:33.697 --> 55:34.930
- And so will you.

55:34.931 --> 55:36.565
- What is that suppose to mean?

55:36.566 --> 55:39.435
- That he's playing
you, like everyone else.

55:39.436 --> 55:41.303
You're just another
pawn to be cast aside

55:41.304 --> 55:42.838
when you've played your part.

55:42.839 --> 55:45.741
- Is this where you try
to get inside my head?

55:45.742 --> 55:49.712
It took Clay five years,
you have 30 seconds.

55:49.713 --> 55:51.280
- Lying takes time,

55:51.281 --> 55:53.348
truth kicks you
right in the teeth.

55:53.349 --> 55:55.117
- What truth would
that be exactly.

55:55.118 --> 55:58.220
- That what you're
doing is wrong, and you know it.

55:58.221 --> 56:01.423
- Nuclear power is everything
that's wrong with this world.

56:01.424 --> 56:02.925
Our fear has become a commodity

56:02.926 --> 56:05.461
and those in power
profit from it.

56:05.462 --> 56:06.595
- Your dad tell you that?

56:06.596 --> 56:08.897
- My father has nothing
to do with this.

56:08.898 --> 56:13.069
- I think he has
everything to do with it.

56:13.937 --> 56:15.204
- He gave 20 years of his life

56:15.205 --> 56:18.674
protecting our
so-called leaders.

56:18.675 --> 56:20.909
And a few men in his detail
go to a brothel in Colombia

56:20.910 --> 56:25.614
where it's legal, and they
throw him under the fucking bus.

56:25.615 --> 56:29.651
No pension, stripped
of his decorations.

56:29.652 --> 56:33.823
He risked his life for them
and they fucking buried him.

56:36.092 --> 56:38.460
- Alright, the system is flawed.

56:38.461 --> 56:41.330
So you're gonna attack a
nuclear power plant to prove it.

56:41.331 --> 56:44.299
- No it's more than that,
it's about sending a message.

56:44.300 --> 56:46.969
- No, that's exactly what it is.

56:46.970 --> 56:50.005
You were hurt by the system
and you wanna hurt it back,

56:50.006 --> 56:52.608
but you'll only be hurting
the people who are part of it.

56:52.609 --> 56:56.613
It's not perfect, but
the alternative is chaos.

56:58.815 --> 57:01.351
- What do you know about hurt?

57:02.886 --> 57:04.319
- I had a friend,

57:04.320 --> 57:07.456
who I was closer to
than my own brother.

57:07.457 --> 57:11.927
He saved my life and I
sent him to prison for it.

57:11.928 --> 57:15.063
But that's my cross,
and I'll carry it.

57:15.064 --> 57:18.000
I don't wanna make kids
sick in California.

57:18.001 --> 57:21.171
- Who said anything
about California?

57:30.880 --> 57:32.848
- San Onofre, that's
where he wants the virus.

57:32.849 --> 57:34.516
- You're lying, we're
gonna put it online,

57:34.517 --> 57:35.918
we're gonna make them
decommission the reactors

57:35.919 --> 57:36.753
because they're vulnerable.

57:36.754 --> 57:38.220
- Where do you think...

57:38.221 --> 57:39.488
- And we're gonna show them
that they're all liars.

57:39.489 --> 57:40.290
- Where do you think all
the money's coming from?

57:40.291 --> 57:41.523
- They have funding.

57:41.524 --> 57:43.058
- The resources
to pull this off.

57:43.059 --> 57:44.960
The cartels gave 'em
10 million dollars

57:44.961 --> 57:46.528
to shut down the
rival's pipeline,

57:46.529 --> 57:48.063
this isn't about
changing anything.

57:48.064 --> 57:49.331
- Are you done?

57:49.332 --> 57:50.632
- It's about drugs,
money, and revenge.

57:50.633 --> 57:51.867
- Are you done?

57:51.868 --> 57:54.102
- I think we both
are, it's over.

57:54.103 --> 57:55.938
- No, it's not.

57:55.939 --> 57:58.775
Get off me you
freak, help, help.

58:30.173 --> 58:31.574
- Federal agent.

01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:01.863
Ah, shit.

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:05.835
- Looking for this?

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:09.938
You dropped it in the path.

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:12.841
Like you said, it's
better this way.

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:14.676
- Stay away from me.

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:15.677
- Or what?

01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:22.418
It was always
gonna come to this.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:28.290
Once you start running, it's
only a matter of time, Vera.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.025
- What do you know, you've
lived your whole fucking life

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.927
by the fucking book.

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:35.664
- It eats you up inside, always
looking over your shoulder,

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:36.933
living in fear.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:41.970
- So wha'da you gonna
do, you gonna shoot me?

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:46.975
- No, you're gonna make a
full confession to the FBI,

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:49.111
maybe they'll cut you a deal.

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:52.181
You didn't kill
anyone, you're a kid,

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:55.618
a good kid in my opinion.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.089
This doesn't have to be the end.

01:01:05.261 --> 01:01:06.862
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:08.096
- It'll never be okay.

01:01:08.097 --> 01:01:09.097
- No, no.

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:11.133
Clay.

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:13.636
Clay.

01:01:13.637 --> 01:01:15.170
- Ah, ah, wait.

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:16.139
You know if I pull
this knife out

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:17.406
she's as good as dead, right?

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:21.109
- It's not her you
want, she's just a kid.

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.611
- With all the times
I've been betrayed,

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:26.014
you'd think I'd be used
to it by now, right.

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.482
- You must be very
proud of yourself,

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:30.118
you found a child and
you made her your puppet.

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:32.554
- People says there's
nothin' to do in prison,

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:35.524
I think I found somethin'.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:36.758
- Tryin' to burn it all down.

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:39.161
You used to be better than that.

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:42.364
- Some people wanna watch
this nation burn, Corbin.

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.266
I could give a good
damn about it anymore.

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:46.468
- So everyone can
just go to hell?

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:49.138
- Not everyone Corbin, just you.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.942
- I'm under the Danaka
Bridge, agent down,

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:56.079
repeat agent down.

01:01:57.313 --> 01:02:00.249
Please, stay with me,
stay with me Vera.

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:04.453
Just breathe, breathe, breathe.

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:07.355
- Please don't tell my dad.

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:09.692
- No, no, no, just breathe.

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:42.384
Give yourself up Clay.

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:45.020
Half the NYPD's
closin' in on you.

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:46.856
You're shoot on sight.

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:52.093
- Really, all I see is
one broken down FBI agent

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:54.430
who's way out of his league.

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:57.766
- Why'd it have to be like this?

01:03:57.767 --> 01:03:58.768
- Like what?

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:03.738
- Us pointing guns
at each other.

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:05.074
We're partners.

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:11.213
You saved my life.

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:13.549
- And you sent me to prison.

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:19.088
- You put yourself in prison
when you took that money.

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:24.594
- I should be thankin' you,
prison taught me things.

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:31.933
- How not to give a fuck
about anyone but yourself.

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.769
- It's the system man.

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:38.240
- You wanna be
the one to end it.

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:39.408
- No, this is.

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:41.843
Sorry to break it
to you partner,

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:45.146
but sometimes the
bad guy gets away.

01:04:45.147 --> 01:04:47.415
- Is that what you are now?

01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:49.585
- That's who you made me.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.161
- You think that was fun for me?

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:01.863
Pointing the finger at my
best friend and saying,

01:05:01.864 --> 01:05:03.331
"Yes, I saw him
take that money."

01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:06.034
You think I enjoyed that?

01:05:06.035 --> 01:05:09.404
I had to go back to work the
next day a fucking pariah.

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:12.107
No one would even look at me.

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:15.011
You know what, I
didn't blame them.

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:18.013
- Fuck you Corbin.

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:19.881
- No, fuck you Clay.

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:21.082
You put yourself in that cell,

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:23.952
and you're gonna put
yourself in the morgue.

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:26.288
- I gave everything.

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:30.592
- We put our lives on the line
every day, that's the job.

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.861
I don't expect a fucking parade
and I certainly don't expect

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:35.530
anyone to pay for my mistakes.

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:37.932
- I woulda given my life
for this fucking country,

01:05:37.933 --> 01:05:40.536
right up until it took my soul.

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:45.073
- You don't have a soul.

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:48.476
- That's the first true
thing you've said all day.

01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:51.380
- I'm tired Clay,
let's call this.

01:05:56.285 --> 01:06:00.256
Someone's gonna shoot
you, might as well be me.

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:20.295
- You got one hell
of an overtime claim
coming for this one,

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:21.296
don't you?

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:25.033
You okay?

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:27.703
- No, no I'm not.

01:08:29.337 --> 01:08:31.107
- Any of that yours?

01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:35.277
- How much of this was set up?

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:39.613
- We knew Clay was
planning something.

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:42.750
He had someone on the inside.

01:08:42.751 --> 01:08:44.519
- So what happens now?

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.020
- Oh it's already happened.

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:48.023
Clay's dead,

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:50.759
The mole's dead,

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:55.863
all-in-all a pretty
successful day.

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:58.198
You might even
get another medal.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.200
- Keep it.

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:05.773
What about the cartels?

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:08.276
The Mexican government
isn't getting involved?

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:11.813
- Well they'll be
informed of course, but

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.983
what're they gonna do, declare
war on the cartels again?

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.917
- So you can threaten a
nuclear power station,

01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:19.988
target our operatives,
and just walk away?

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:23.725
- No one walks away
Corbin, you know that.

01:09:23.725 --> 01:09:25.059
This is as much
an information war

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.395
as it is about dead bodies.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.803
- We should make more
statutes of Grant.

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:37.939
- He's on the 50.

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:41.075
- Our greatest military leader
and our worst President.

01:09:41.076 --> 01:09:43.176
Perfect symbol of America.

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:44.912
Proof you can have all the world

01:09:44.913 --> 01:09:47.849
and no fucking clue
what to do with it.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.984
- You gettin' political on me?

01:09:49.984 --> 01:09:51.754
- Just doin' my job.

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:11.540
- Why don't you hold on to it.

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:16.110
It's probably safer
with you anyway.

01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:18.680
I think we've proved that.

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:19.949
- What's on it?

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:24.485
- What everyone
thought was on it.

01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:26.655
A couple of small changes.

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:31.860
It had to be real enough to
bring them into the open.

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:35.530
Hey don't lose it.

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:39.702
We can only play this game
when we still have secrets.

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:49.878
Don't think about it too much.

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:55.117
And get some sleep.
