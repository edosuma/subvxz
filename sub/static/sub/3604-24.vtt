to leave. I would take it
before I change my mind.

better than all of them.

looked at me,

29:47.370 --> 29:49.782
like I was some
kind of monster.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.745

with those scissors.

the only woman
who ever loved me?

you lost yourself, why
you've brought me back.

pretty good, huh?

31:38.064 --> 31:40.521

Mommy and Daddy weren't
getting along so well.

31:40.608 --> 31:41.848
I didn't even know
that you existed.

31:41.942 --> 31:44.729

I would take one look
at you and fall in love.

31:44.820 --> 31:47.482

I fell in love.

31:48.157 --> 31:49.522

You know, I know
what you're thinking,
and I can't.

31:51.452 --> 31:54.319
I can't just put a whammy
on Mommy, make her forget
everything and forgive me.

31:54.413 --> 31:58.326
No, I can't do that. 'Cause
we can't use our powers
on unsuspecting people.

the biggest challenges
we've seen in a generation,

33:06.402 --> 33:09.360
from terrorism to
global economic chaos.

33:09.446 --> 33:13.564
Our leadership is
ill-prepared to meet
these challenges.

33:14.869 --> 33:16.655
We need to shake up
the power structure
in Washington

33:16.745 --> 33:21.956
in order to bring real change
to America, and l have a plan
that will do just that.

33:22.585 --> 33:27.249

33:27.339 --> 33:29.500

My office has made
numerous phone calls
to the White House,

33:32.011 --> 33:36.880
but it seems the President
is just too busy to meet
with me face to face,

33:36.974 --> 33:40.637
too occupied keeping
the status quo,
business as usual.

33:40.728 --> 33:47.065
It seems he likes to talk
about change, but he isn’t
ready or willing to make it.

33:47.193 --> 33:51.061
/ know a way to bring real
purpose back to the White
House, back to this country.

33:51.155 --> 33:55.319
And / promise you that
when the President
agrees to meet with me,

33:55.701 --> 34:00.991
when he agrees to shake
my hand, real change
will come to this country,

34:01.415 --> 34:04.498
and nothing will
ever be the same.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.302
How is he doing this?

MR. BENNET:
He's a shape-shifter.

34:18.599 --> 34:21.636
And now he's one handshake
away from being the most
powerful man on Earth.

34:21.727 --> 34:23.183
Maybe the President
won't meet with him.

34:23.270 --> 34:24.259
Are you kidding me?

34:24.355 --> 34:28.018
After that vitriol? I'm sure
my staff's arranging a
sit-down with him as we speak.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.393

We're surrounded.
It's okay. It's okay.

37:35.504 --> 37:37.415
Just stay close to me,
okay? I'll protect us.

37:39.133 --> 37:40.373
Both to the side.

37:43.887 --> 37:45.002
Down there.

SYLAR: Looking for this?

38:00.279 --> 38:01.860
Get the hell
out of my body.

38:06.535 --> 38:07.945
Poor Nathan.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.824
You loathe yourself so much.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.203
What the hell are
you talking about?

38:28.056 --> 38:30.843
I've taken a stroll
through your life,
Senator.

38:31.477 --> 38:35.186
You've been handed so much
and yet you want to destroy

38:35.272 --> 38:39.811
the one part of yourself
that makes you truly
special. Your power.

38:40.235 --> 38:42.146
You have no idea
who I am.

38:42.237 --> 38:43.226
Sure, I do.

38:44.615 --> 38:49.905
Your mother gave me a very
useful ability to know the
history of any object I touch.

38:50.162 --> 38:53.074
You have been a bad boy.

38:54.416 --> 38:56.281
Deceiving your mother,

38:56.418 --> 39:00.787
turning on your brother,
your sweet, precious Claire.

39:02.883 --> 39:06.751
And this is
the jacket you wore when
you betrayed everyone.

39:08.096 --> 39:10.587
I don't need
to defend myself to you.

39:12.726 --> 39:16.310
You're pathetic.
You're a psychopath.

39:17.105 --> 39:20.848
People like you are the reason
I went to the President
in the first place.

39:20.943 --> 39:26.939
If you think for one minute
anybody's gonna believe
you're me, you're wrong.

39:29.785 --> 39:31.616
I'm not going to be you.

39:33.288 --> 39:35.119
I'm going to be
better than you.

39:38.085 --> 39:39.791
Goodbye, Nathan.

39:48.262 --> 39:50.423
What the hell
did you do that for?

39:50.514 --> 39:54.473
Petrelli's a US Senator.
We need to handle him
delicately.

40:01.650 --> 40:05.268
And you need
to become
Agent Taub again.

40:05.862 --> 40:09.821
We're moving to take
the rest of them down.
You should be part of that.

40:32.848 --> 40:36.682
We struggle to find
meaningful connections
to one another.

40:37.477 --> 40:39.513
We are the caring friend.

40:46.278 --> 40:47.859
The loving father.

The doting mother.

We fight and we love
in the hope that
somehow, together,

40:58.874 --> 41:01.832
we can understand
our significance
in the universe.

41:03.003 --> 41:07.713
But in the end,
no one can
share our burden.

41:09.217 --> 41:12.254
Each of us alone
must answer the question.

41:13.639 --> 41:14.845
"Who am I?

41:15.974 --> 41:18.090
"What does it mean
to be alive?

41:21.355 --> 41:26.065
"And in the vast
infinity of time,
how do I matter?"

41:36.953 --> 41:38.739
What are you doing?

41:40.165 --> 41:42.952
I told you
I need you
to be Taub.

41:43.502 --> 41:46.084
I'm not interested
in what you need anymore.

41:57.182 --> 42:01.141
Such a waste.
You just didn't
know your place.

42:03.313 --> 42:06.601
Agent Gordon,
send a clean-up crew to...

42:08.985 --> 42:10.145
Check that.

42:33.135 --> 42:34.500
