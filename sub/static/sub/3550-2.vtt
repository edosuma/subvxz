WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:05.476
IT WAS A JOYOUS OCCASION
UNTIL...

00:05.476 --> 00:08.079
DID I MISS ANYTHING?
 I'M ASKING YOU NICELY
TO LEAVE.

00:08.079 --> 00:11.312
IF YOU DON'T, I WILL DRAG YOU
OUT OF THIS CHURCH MYSELF.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.314
(crying)
I DON'T LOVE THESE BABIES.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.646
LYNETTE STRUGGLED
WITH HER PREGNANCY.

00:15.646 --> 00:17.318
STOP SAYING THAT.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.220
GABY MADE A COMMITMENT...

00:19.220 --> 00:21.021
I AM NOW OFFICIALLY
YOUR GUARDIAN.
 AND BREE...

00:21.021 --> 00:24.055
I'M MARRIED.
 TO A MAN
WHO'S BLACKMAILING YOU.

00:24.055 --> 00:26.327
JUMPED IN WITH BOTH FEET.
 AAH!

00:26.327 --> 00:29.300
I THINK WE COULD BE HAPPY HERE,
RIGHT, DANNY?
 NEW NEIGHBORS...

00:29.300 --> 00:32.603
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
TO A MOVIE SOMETIME?
 MOVED IN.

00:32.603 --> 00:35.306
LOOK, DANNY,
PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN.
 GO TO HELL.

00:35.306 --> 00:37.438
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO THAT KID?
 HE'S A TEENAGER.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.070
GO LOOK FOR HIM.

00:39.070 --> 00:42.273
AND EVIL MADE AN APPEARANCE
ON WISTERIA LANE.

00:48.149 --> 00:51.782
(Mary Alice) THE FIRST TIME
KAREN McCLUSKEY SAW ROY BENDER,

00:51.782 --> 00:54.825
SHE DID SOMETHING
SHE DIDN'T EXPECT TO DO.

00:54.825 --> 00:58.389
SHE SMILED.

00:58.389 --> 01:00.791
THE NEXT TIME THEY MET,

01:00.791 --> 01:04.364
ROY DID SOMETHING
 HE DIDN'T EXPECT TO DO.

01:04.364 --> 01:08.169
HE SMILED BACK.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.841
AFTER A WEEK
OF SLY FLIRTATIONS,

01:10.841 --> 01:15.346
KAREN AND ROY DID SOMETHING
 NO ONE EXPECTED THEM TO DO.

01:17.148 --> 01:19.480
(door closes)
 AND THEY DID IT TWICE.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.811
(barks)

01:22.483 --> 01:23.854
WITH EACH PASSING DAY,

01:23.854 --> 01:27.818
KAREN BEGAN TO FEEL SOMETHING
SHE HADN'T FELT IN YEARS,

01:27.818 --> 01:30.521
AND SHE REALIZED
SHE NEEDED TO KNOW

01:30.521 --> 01:34.295
IF ROY WAS FEELING
THE SAME WAY.

01:34.295 --> 01:37.097
(sighs)

01:37.097 --> 01:39.099
HAS IT BEEN AN HOUR YET?

01:39.099 --> 01:40.831
14 MINUTES.

01:40.831 --> 01:43.834
COME ON. YOUR DOCTOR SAID
YOU NEED TO WALK AN HOUR A DAY.

01:43.834 --> 01:46.207
THE LITTLE SNOT NOSE--

01:46.207 --> 01:49.210
I'D LIKE TO DROP DEAD
JUST TO PISS HIM OFF.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.142
DON'T EVEN JOKE ABOUT THAT.

01:51.142 --> 01:54.815
I LIKE HAVING YOU AROUND.
I LIKE IT A LOT.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.817
YOU REMEMBER
TO PUT THE SEAT DOWN.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.819
YOU CAN DRIVE AT NIGHT.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.322
(chuckles) A GIRL COULD
GET USED TO THAT.

02:01.322 --> 02:04.355
HOW MANY MINUTES
HAS IT BEEN NOW?

02:04.355 --> 02:07.828
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
HOW I FEEL, ROY.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.161
I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.

02:10.161 --> 02:12.863
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT... (sighs)

02:12.863 --> 02:15.336
YOU JUST GET ONE BIG LOVE
IN THIS LIFETIME,

02:15.336 --> 02:17.338
AND THAT WAS
MY HUSBAND GILBERT.

02:17.338 --> 02:20.341
AND AFTER HE DIED,
I FIGURED THE REST OF MY LIFE

02:20.341 --> 02:22.673
WAS ABOUT MAKING
MEATLOAF FOR ONE.

02:22.673 --> 02:25.916
THEN YOU COME ALONG AND...

02:25.916 --> 02:28.749
WELL... HELL.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.581
I LOVE YOU, ROY.

02:34.785 --> 02:38.789
ISN'T THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANNA SAY TO ME?

02:38.789 --> 02:40.791
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL.

02:40.791 --> 02:43.864
A WOMAN NEEDS
TO HEAR THE WORDS.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.567
(sighs) ALL RIGHT.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.240
HERE WE GO.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.842
WHAT THE HELL?!

02:51.842 --> 02:54.745
OH, MY GOD!

02:54.745 --> 02:58.309
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?!

02:58.309 --> 03:00.951
WE GOTTA CALL 9-1-1!

03:00.951 --> 03:05.716
FOR A MOMENT,
MRS. McCLUSKEY DIDN'T MOVE.

03:05.716 --> 03:07.688
AND WHETHER IT WAS
HER BOYFRIEND'S DISCOVERY

03:07.688 --> 03:09.189
OF JULIE MAYER

03:09.189 --> 03:11.762
OR HER REALIZATION

03:11.762 --> 03:14.265
THAT HE WASN'T GOING
TO SAY THE WORDS

03:14.265 --> 03:17.298
SHE DESPERATELY NEEDED TO HEAR,

03:17.298 --> 03:21.302
KAREN McCLUSKEY
SUDDENLY FELT THE URGE TO...

03:21.302 --> 03:35.846
AAH!

03:35.846 --> 03:38.349
IT WAS A SHAME
WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY,

03:38.349 --> 03:42.493
CONSIDERING HOW NICELY
THE MORNING HAD BEGUN.

03:42.493 --> 03:45.656
ONE NEIGHBOR WAS OUT READING
THE SPORTS SECTION,

03:45.656 --> 03:47.958
DELIGHTED TO SEE
THAT HIS TEAM HAD WON.

03:47.958 --> 03:49.600
(speaks inaudibly)

03:49.600 --> 03:52.433
A CHILD WAS
PLAYING WITH HER NEW DOLL,

03:52.433 --> 03:55.936
THRILLED TO DISCOVER
JUST HOW DURABLE IT WAS.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.768
(thudding)

03:57.768 --> 04:01.372
AND A WOMAN WAS WALKING
WITH THE MAN SHE ADORED,

04:01.372 --> 04:07.618
DETERMINED TO SAY SHE LOVED HIM
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.

04:07.618 --> 04:11.352
YES,
UP UNTIL THE SCREAMING STARTED,

04:11.352 --> 04:14.985
PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS
GOING TO BE A WONDERFUL DAY.

04:35.406 --> 04:38.749
(sputters)

04:38.749 --> 04:40.781
OH, GOOD. YOU'RE UP.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.913
UH, YEAH.

04:42.913 --> 04:44.054
GOOD MORNIN'.

04:44.054 --> 04:45.516
GOOD MORNING.

04:45.516 --> 04:47.017
MMM.

04:47.017 --> 04:48.559
MMM.

04:48.559 --> 04:51.562
DID YOU GO TO SLEEP WITH
A BREATH MINT IN YOUR MOUTH?

04:51.562 --> 04:53.524
THIS IS OUR FIRST MORNING

04:53.524 --> 04:55.826
WAKING UP
AS HUSBAND AND WIFE AGAIN.

04:55.826 --> 04:57.828
I WANTED IT TO BE PERFECT.

04:57.828 --> 05:00.070
WELL, IT COULDN'T BE
MORE PERFECT.

05:00.070 --> 05:03.033
MMM. MMM.

05:03.033 --> 05:05.075
MMM... YES, IT COULD.

05:05.075 --> 05:07.037
(sighs)

05:07.037 --> 05:09.440
HERE'S A BREATH MINT
FOR YOU.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.911
(laughs)
 (chuckles)

05:10.911 --> 05:12.913
AHH.
 (sighs)

05:12.913 --> 05:16.016
DID WE REALLY GET MARRIED
LAST NIGHT?

05:16.016 --> 05:18.519
EITHER THAT,
OR WE PAID A LOT OF MONEY

05:18.519 --> 05:20.521
TO WATCH OUR FRIENDS
GET DRUNK.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.052
(chuckles)
 COME HERE, MRS. DELFINO.

05:22.052 --> 05:23.624
ALL RIGHT.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.827
WE HAVE A HONEYMOON
TO GET STARTED.
 MMM.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.029
HEY, WHATCHA DOIN'?

05:29.029 --> 05:32.603
UH, NOTHING, SWEETIE.

05:32.603 --> 05:35.606
WHY DON'T YOU GO PLAY
IN YOUR ROOM FOR TEN MINUTES?

05:35.606 --> 05:37.067
TEN?

05:37.067 --> 05:39.640
I WANNA PLAY IN HERE.

05:41.071 --> 05:42.613
OKAY.

05:42.613 --> 05:44.645
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.917
IN FACT, I CAN'T THINK
OF A BETTER WAY

05:46.917 --> 05:48.919
TO START
OUR NEW LIFE TOGETHER--

05:48.919 --> 05:52.953
ALL OF US HERE,
JULIE'S HOME.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.955
YOU KNOW,
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS,

05:54.955 --> 05:57.988
WHEN I USED TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT I NEEDED TO BE HAPPY,

05:57.988 --> 05:59.990
THIS WAS IT.

05:59.990 --> 06:01.532
MM.

06:01.532 --> 06:04.034
THIS WAS THE PICTURE
I HAD IN MY HEAD.

06:04.034 --> 06:04.995
(chuckles)

06:04.995 --> 06:06.497
(chuckles)

06:06.497 --> 06:08.799
(Karen) AAH!

06:08.799 --> 06:10.701
HEY, DANNY. IT'S ANA.

06:10.701 --> 06:13.704
DID YOU GET MY MESSAGE
ABOUT GOING TO THE MALL LATER?

06:13.704 --> 06:16.677
OH, OKAY. THAT'S COOL.
UM, HOW ABOUT TOMORROW?

06:18.609 --> 06:20.881
YEAH, ME, TOO.
THE MALL BLOWS.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.154
WELL, GIVE ME A CALL
IF YOU WANNA HANG.

06:24.154 --> 06:26.557
(beep)

06:26.557 --> 06:28.018
SHOT YOU DOWN, HUH?

06:28.018 --> 06:31.992
I COULD GET DANNY BOLEN
ANYTIME I WANT.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.995
OKAY. WELL, LET ME KNOW
IF YOU NEED ANY HELP.

06:37.127 --> 06:40.501
NOT THAT I NEED YOUR HELP,
BUT...

06:40.501 --> 06:42.633
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

06:42.633 --> 06:45.676
HERE'S THE SECRET TO LANDING
A GUY--YOU HAVE TO IGNORE THEM.

06:45.676 --> 06:48.078
YOU ARE THE ONE
WHO ENDS THE CONVERSATION.

06:48.078 --> 06:51.982
YOU ARE THE ONE
TOO BUSY TO GET TOGETHER.
 AND?

06:51.982 --> 06:54.645
AND THAT'S IT.
TRUST ME, IT WORKS.

06:54.645 --> 06:56.647
HOW DO YOU THINK
I PLAYED THIS ONE?

06:56.647 --> 06:58.649
YOU DID NOT PLAY ME.

06:58.649 --> 07:00.020
LIKE A FIDDLE.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.022
YOU KNOW HOW MANY RUNWAY SHOWS
HE SAT THROUGH

07:02.022 --> 07:05.125
BEFORE I WOULD EVEN
LOOK AT HIM? SIX.
 IT WASN'T THAT MANY.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.728
SIX.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.501
AND WHEN HE FINALLY
ASKED ME OUT, I SAID, "OKAY."

07:10.501 --> 07:12.503
BUT THEN AT THE LAST MINUTE,

07:12.503 --> 07:15.906
I BACKED OUT,
SAYING I DIDN'T FEEL WELL.
 YOU WEREN'T REALLY SICK?

07:15.906 --> 07:17.067
GOD, NO.

07:17.067 --> 07:19.970
I HAD A PEDICURE AND THEN
WENT TO SARDI'S FOR DRINKS.

07:19.970 --> 07:22.473
AFTER THAT, HE WAS MY SLAVE.

07:22.473 --> 07:24.444
I RENTED A YACHT THAT DAY!

07:24.444 --> 07:26.046
REALLY? THAT'S HILARIOUS.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.749
A WEEK LATER,
HE GAVE ME THIS.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.921
I LOST THAT DEPOSIT!

07:30.921 --> 07:34.925
EAT YOUR WAFFLES!
I'M TEACHING!

07:34.925 --> 07:37.027
(Karen) AAH!

07:37.027 --> 07:40.661
(juice pouring)

07:40.661 --> 07:42.693
LOOK AT YOU.

07:42.693 --> 07:44.995
I KNOW.
MARTHA FRIGGIN' STEWART, EH?
 (chuckles)

07:44.995 --> 07:46.697
(light slap)
 (chuckles)

07:46.697 --> 07:50.741
HEY, ANA. YEAH. I'M--
I'M NOT MUCH OF A-A MALL GUY.

07:50.741 --> 07:52.743
YEAH.

07:52.743 --> 07:55.145
BUT, UH, I'LL SEE YOU
AROUND, OKAY?

07:55.145 --> 07:57.247
(beep)
 YEP. MORNIN'.

07:57.247 --> 07:59.249
WHERE WERE YOU
LAST NIGHT?

07:59.249 --> 08:00.851
OUT.

08:00.851 --> 08:03.614
YEAH, WHERE "OUT"?

08:03.614 --> 08:05.656
I DROVE AROUND
LOOKIN' FOR YOU.

08:05.656 --> 08:10.060
I COULDN'T SLEEP.
I WENT A LOT OF PLACES.

08:10.060 --> 08:11.161
HAPPY NOW?

08:11.161 --> 08:13.664
HEY! DON'T BE A WISEASS.

08:13.664 --> 08:15.666
WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

08:15.666 --> 08:18.098
NICK, GO TAKE YOUR SHOWER.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.169
(whispers) GO.

08:21.872 --> 08:23.974
(sighs)

08:26.006 --> 08:27.678
(sighs)

08:27.678 --> 08:30.981
12 ORANGES FOR A HALF A CUP
OF JUICE? THAT'S WORTH IT.

08:30.981 --> 08:33.644
(scoffs)
 NO, THANKS.

08:33.644 --> 08:36.647
OKAY, SO WE'RE STICKING WITH
THE MOODY TEENAGER THING, HUH?

08:38.889 --> 08:40.890
COME ON.
WHAT'D YOU DO LAST NIGHT?

08:40.890 --> 08:43.594
(mouth full)
I ALREADY TOLD DAD.

08:43.594 --> 08:45.896
I WENT OUT.

08:45.896 --> 08:47.227
DANNY, IT'S ME.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.229
WHAT DID I DO
WHEN PETER SPADARO

08:49.229 --> 08:52.062
PUSHED YOU OFF THE SWING SET
IN FIRST GRADE, HUH?

08:52.062 --> 08:54.064
I THREW A SLUSHEE
IN HIS MOM'S FACE.

08:54.064 --> 08:58.268
CLEARLY, I HAVE YOUR BACK.
TALK TO ME.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.914
I WENT OUT DRINKING.

09:07.578 --> 09:10.651
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
TO DO HERE, MOM.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.683
(sighs) LOOK...

09:12.683 --> 09:15.185
I KNOW THIS MOVE
HAS BEEN HARD ON YOU,

09:15.185 --> 09:17.688
BUT TRY TO MAKE
THE BEST OF IT, OKAY?

09:17.688 --> 09:21.031
TRUST ME, IT TAKES
A LOT MORE EFFORT TO BE UNHAPPY.

09:24.134 --> 09:26.336
OKAY.

09:26.336 --> 09:27.598
(clicks tongue)

09:27.598 --> 09:28.969
MMM.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.802
THANKS FOR BEING HONEST.
 MM-HMM.

09:31.802 --> 09:33.804
AND THAT'S FOR DRINKING.
 (mouths word)

09:33.804 --> 09:35.806
(Karen) AAH!

09:35.806 --> 09:40.150
MOM, WAS THAT YOU THROWING UP
IN THE BATHROOM THIS MORNING?

09:40.150 --> 09:43.583
UH... YEAH. I WAS JUST FEELING
A LITTLE NAUSEOUS.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.116
MM, SICK IN THE MORNING.

09:46.116 --> 09:49.019
IF YOU WEREN'T SO OLD,
I'D SAY YOU WERE PREGNANT.

09:51.361 --> 09:53.363
OKAY, GUYS,

09:53.363 --> 09:55.025
HERE'S THE DEAL.

09:55.025 --> 09:57.998
I HAD SOME BAD SEAFOOD
LAST NIGHT.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.270
AT THE WEDDING?
WE HAD CHICKEN.

10:00.270 --> 10:02.132
I MEAN AFTER THAT.

10:02.132 --> 10:05.135
I WENT OUT TO GET GAS,
AND I HAD...

10:05.135 --> 10:07.708
CLAMS.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.880
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHERE I ATE THEM.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.842
I JUST REMEMBER SEEING
THIS SIGN THAT SAID "CLAMS,"

10:11.842 --> 10:14.845
AND I THOUGHT, "OOH, I HAVEN'T
HAD CLAMS FOR A WHILE."

10:14.845 --> 10:17.147
SO I WENT IN AND HAD CLAMS,
BUT THEY WERE BAD,

10:17.147 --> 10:20.050
WHICH IS WHY I WAS THROWING UP.
UGH.

10:21.992 --> 10:25.195
WELL, MY POINT WAS,
NEXT TIME, PLEASE FLUSH.

10:26.997 --> 10:30.100
AND I'M DONE
WITH MY OATMEAL.

10:32.963 --> 10:34.234
(sighs)

10:39.810 --> 10:41.011
WHAT?

10:41.011 --> 10:43.313
WE SAID WE WEREN'T GONNA
TELL THE KIDS

10:43.313 --> 10:45.315
UNTIL AFTER
THE FIRST TRIMESTER.

10:45.315 --> 10:47.948
THAT'S NEXT FRIDAY.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.681
WOW, YOU ACTUALLY KNOW
THE DAY.

10:50.681 --> 10:53.854
WOW, YOU'RE REALLY INTO THIS.
 WELL, SOMEONE HAS TO BE.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.156
I'M NOT TELLING ANYBODY
UNTIL WE'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE

10:56.156 --> 10:59.029
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.
 REALLY?

10:59.029 --> 11:02.192
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S THE ONLY
REASON YOU'RE NOT TELLING THEM?

11:03.964 --> 11:06.036
(Karen) AAH!

11:06.036 --> 11:08.699
(knock on door)
 (groans)

11:08.699 --> 11:11.972
(grunts)

11:11.972 --> 11:15.005
I CAN'T OPEN MY EYES
ALL THE WAY. WHO IS IT?

11:15.005 --> 11:17.908
DID SOMEONE HAVE TOO MUCH WINE
AT THE WEDDING?

11:17.908 --> 11:21.151
I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS TOO DRUNK TO NOTICE.

11:21.151 --> 11:23.083
(chuckles)

11:23.083 --> 11:25.956
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.
I'M JUST LOOKING FOR BREE.

11:25.956 --> 11:28.158
OH, SHE'S NOT HERE.

11:28.158 --> 11:31.021
OH. WHERE'D SHE GO?
 I DON'T KNOW.

11:31.021 --> 11:33.163
I JUST WOKE UP,
AND SHE WAS ALREADY GONE.

11:33.163 --> 11:35.165
SHE'S NOT
IN THE TEST KITCHEN?

11:35.165 --> 11:39.069
NO. I JUST WANTED TO LET HER
KNOW I'M TAKING THE MORNING OFF.

11:39.069 --> 11:41.071
OH. WELL, I'M SURE
SHE'LL UNDERSTAND,

11:41.071 --> 11:43.073
GIVEN ALL
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

11:43.073 --> 11:45.075
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:45.075 --> 11:47.978
WELL, YOU KNOW, MIKE AND SUSAN
GETTING MARRIED.

11:47.978 --> 11:50.110
OH, I'M NOT UPSET
ABOUT THAT.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.081
REALLY?

11:51.081 --> 11:54.244
OH. GOOD. I'M GLAD.

11:54.244 --> 11:56.887
(laughs) I MEAN, IT'S NOT
AS IF IT'S GONNA LAST.

11:56.887 --> 11:58.348
EXCUSE ME?

11:58.348 --> 12:02.152
OH, MIKE DOESN'T REALLY
LOVE SUSAN.

12:02.152 --> 12:05.055
HE JUST FEELS SORRY
FOR HER.

12:05.055 --> 12:07.798
HE'LL BE BACK.

12:07.798 --> 12:09.830
(Karen) AAH!

12:09.830 --> 12:12.132
MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.104
(panting) OH!

12:14.104 --> 12:17.067
THAT... WAS AMAZING.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.909
YEAH.

12:18.909 --> 12:20.911
WHO KNEW YOU WERE
SUCH A WILD WOMAN?

12:20.911 --> 12:23.213
I'M NOT. I'VE NEVER
DONE THIS BEFORE.

12:23.213 --> 12:25.876
WELL, YOU ARE
A FAST LEARNER.

12:25.876 --> 12:27.217
NO.

12:27.217 --> 12:30.220
I MEAN, SEX FOR ME
HAS ALWAYS HAD TO HAVE

12:30.220 --> 12:32.422
AN EMOTIONAL, ROMANTIC
OR EVEN SPIRITUAL DIMENSION.

12:32.422 --> 12:35.425
I CAN SEE NOW YOU CAN TAKE ALL
OF THAT AWAY AND IT'S STILL...

12:35.425 --> 12:38.358
(inhales sharply)
MARVELOUS RECREATION.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.030
(chuckles)
 THE BEST THERE IS.

12:40.030 --> 12:42.833
EXCEPT, OF COURSE,
WHEN YOU ACTUALLY TRIED TO--
 I'M SORRY.

12:42.833 --> 12:45.135
I MEAN, REALLY.
 WELL, SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT.

12:45.135 --> 12:48.198
YOU'VE DONE THIS A LOT,
HAVEN'T YOU?

12:48.198 --> 12:51.301
YOU DON'T STAY THIS GOOD
BY SKIPPING PRACTICE.

12:51.301 --> 12:53.944
GOD, YOU'RE A PIG.
KISS ME.

12:53.944 --> 12:55.775
(moaning)

12:55.775 --> 12:58.148
(cell phone rings)

12:58.148 --> 12:59.149
OH!

12:59.149 --> 13:01.111
(ring)
 HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

13:03.153 --> 13:04.855
(sighs)
 (ring)

13:04.855 --> 13:07.787
WELL, THAT'S WEIRD.
IT'S MIKE.
 (beep)

13:07.787 --> 13:09.119
HELLO?

13:09.119 --> 13:11.421
HEY, KARL, LISTEN.

13:11.421 --> 13:13.423
THERE'S NO EASY WAY
TO SAY THIS,

13:13.423 --> 13:15.966
BUT SOMETHING'S HAPPENED
TO JULIE.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.802
(chatter on police radio)

13:28.238 --> 13:30.240
I MEAN,
SHE WAS JUST LYING THERE.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.442
WHAT IF WE HADN'T
FOUND HER IN TIME?

13:32.442 --> 13:34.144
THANK GOD YOU DID.

13:37.047 --> 13:38.348
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?

13:38.348 --> 13:41.551
I MEAN, JULIE'S, LIKE,
THE NICEST GIRL IN THE WORLD.

13:41.551 --> 13:43.954
I KNOW.
WHO'D WANT TO HURT HER?

13:43.954 --> 13:46.026
(door opens)

14:08.478 --> 14:10.480
(indistinct conversations)

14:10.480 --> 14:12.482
(Lynette) OKAY, I GOTTA GO.

14:12.482 --> 14:15.355
WE'LL CALL YOU FROM THE HOSPITAL
AS SOON AS WE HEAR ANYTHING.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.959
TELL SUSAN AND MIKE
WE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF M.J.

14:18.959 --> 14:22.262
THIS IS INSANE. HOW COULD
SOMEONE STRANGLE JULIE?

14:22.262 --> 14:26.236
I KNOW, AND ON OUR PROPERTY.
IT COULD'VE BEEN ME.

14:26.236 --> 14:29.239
I'VE NEVER HAD
MUCH UPPER BODY STRENGTH.

14:32.302 --> 14:35.976
I'D LOVE TO SAY
HE MEANS WELL, BUT...

14:35.976 --> 14:37.607
(door opens)

14:37.607 --> 14:40.410
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
 (door closes)

14:40.410 --> 14:42.412
WELL, THIS HORRIBLE THING
HAPPENED.

14:42.412 --> 14:45.115
WE'RE ALL OUT HERE
TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT.

14:45.115 --> 14:47.457
WHERE ARE THEY?

14:49.019 --> 14:51.161
OH, THEY WERE OUT HERE...

14:51.161 --> 14:53.163
FOR A MINUTE.

14:54.464 --> 14:56.466
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

14:56.466 --> 14:59.169
HOW MUCH DO WE EVEN KNOW
ABOUT THESE PEOPLE?

14:59.169 --> 15:02.232
NOT MUCH. THEY'RE FROM NEW YORK.
THEY HAVE A SON...

15:02.232 --> 15:04.234
DANNY, WHO I SAW

15:04.234 --> 15:08.238
COMING OUT OF A MOVIE
THE OTHER NIGHT WITH JULIE.

15:08.238 --> 15:10.540
SERIOUSLY? LIKE A DATE?

15:10.540 --> 15:12.212
SURE LOOKED THAT WAY.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.214
YOU KNOW,
WHEN WOMEN ARE ATTACKED,

15:14.214 --> 15:17.988
THE POLICE LOOK AT THE HUSBANDS
OR THE BOYFRIENDS FIRST.

15:17.988 --> 15:22.152
MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT WE GET
TO KNOW OUR NEW NEIGHBORS.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.129
OKAY, THEY ARE ALL
LOOKING AT OUR PLACE,

15:29.129 --> 15:32.202
AND I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE
ADMIRING OUR AZALEAS.

15:32.202 --> 15:34.504
WHY ARE THEY STARING AT US?

15:34.504 --> 15:37.137
OH, LET'S SEE. UH, WE'RE
THE NEW PEOPLE ON THE BLOCK,

15:37.137 --> 15:39.139
MRS. McCLUSKEY SAW YOU
FIGHTIN' WITH JULIE,

15:39.139 --> 15:41.441
AND, UH, THIS MORNING,
SHE TURNS UP ALMOST DEAD.

15:41.441 --> 15:45.145
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.547
I LIKE JULIE.
 THEN WHAT WERE YOU
FIGHTIN' ABOUT?

15:47.547 --> 15:50.620
NOTHIN'. IT'S PERSONAL.

15:50.620 --> 15:53.153
YOU'RE NOT GETTIN'
HOW SERIOUS THIS IS.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.585
IF THAT OLD LADY TALKS
TO THE COPS, WE GOT PROBLEMS.

15:55.585 --> 15:58.088
OKAY, OKAY. DANNY,
JUST TELL ME WHERE YOU WENT

15:58.088 --> 16:00.090
WHEN YOU WERE DRINKING
LAST NIGHT.

16:00.090 --> 16:02.092
I KEEP TRYING
TO REMEMBER.

16:02.092 --> 16:04.334
I... I THINK
I WAS AT THE PARK.

16:04.334 --> 16:07.167
I DROVE BY THE PARK.
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.599
I DRANK A LOT, OKAY?
IT'S A LITTLE FUZZY.

16:09.599 --> 16:11.541
THAT'S GREAT, DANNY,
YOU KNOW?

16:11.541 --> 16:14.074
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

16:14.074 --> 16:17.507
ALL RIGHT, IF ANYBODY ASKS,
LET'S JUST SAY

16:17.507 --> 16:22.212
HE WAS HOME WITH US.
 NO, BECAUSE IF ANYBODY
SAW HIM OUT, WE'RE DONE.

16:22.212 --> 16:24.614
MAYBE THE OLD LADY
WON'T TALK TO THE COPS.

16:24.614 --> 16:28.358
UH, MAYBE I WON'T NEED
AN ALIBI.
 DANNY, PEOPLE ARE ALREADY
LOOKIN' OVER HERE!

16:28.358 --> 16:31.291
MAYBE THAT IS BECAUSE
WE ARE HIDING IN OUR HOUSE

16:31.291 --> 16:34.764
LIKE GUILTY PEOPLE.

16:34.764 --> 16:37.767
NOW I AM GOING TO MAKE
SUSAN AND MIKE A MANICOTT'.

16:37.767 --> 16:41.601
AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO GET OUT
THERE AND START HUGGING PEOPLE.

16:45.605 --> 16:49.279
THE COPS ARE GOING DOOR-TO-DOOR
ASKING QUESTIONS.

16:49.279 --> 16:52.782
WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE THEY'RE HERE.

16:52.782 --> 16:55.315
WHAT AM I GONNA
TELL THEM, HUH?

16:55.315 --> 16:56.316
THE TRUTH--

16:56.316 --> 16:59.349
THAT YOU SAW THAT BOLEN KID
FIGHTING WITH JULIE.

16:59.349 --> 17:01.221
WELL, IT WAS JUST
A COUPLE OF WORDS.

17:01.221 --> 17:04.753
THEY'RE KIDS. THEY ARGUE.
IF I START POINTING FINGERS...

17:04.753 --> 17:07.727
YOU'RE JUST TELLING 'EM
WHAT YOU KNOW.
 WHAT IF I'M WRONG?

17:07.727 --> 17:11.361
I CAN'T HAVE ANOTHER FAMILY
ON THIS STREET HATING ME.

17:11.361 --> 17:13.303
WHO HATES YOU?

17:13.303 --> 17:15.805
OH, THE GAY GUYS.
I'VE SAID STUFF.

17:17.337 --> 17:20.109
LISTEN TO ME.

17:20.109 --> 17:22.512
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOTTA DO
THE RIGHT THING.

17:22.512 --> 17:24.374
YEAH.

17:24.374 --> 17:27.077
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO IT ALONE.

17:27.077 --> 17:29.549
I'M GONNA BE RIGHT HERE
WITH YA. AND...

17:29.549 --> 17:33.253
THERE WAS SOMETHING
I WANTED TO SAY BEFORE,

17:33.253 --> 17:36.386
AND I DIDN'T GET
THE CHANCE.

17:36.386 --> 17:40.230
IF YOU GOT HIT BY A BUS,

17:40.230 --> 17:43.233
I'D REALLY MISS YOU.

17:44.794 --> 17:47.367
THAT'S IT?

17:47.367 --> 17:49.799
OKAY.

17:49.799 --> 17:51.801
YOU'RE SHOWERING ALONE
TONIGHT.

17:51.801 --> 17:54.304
ALL RIGHT, I LOVE YOU.

17:54.304 --> 17:56.306
THERE.

17:56.306 --> 17:59.109
I SAID IT.

18:00.710 --> 18:03.853
DO YOU MEAN IT, OR IS THAT JUST
YOUR BETA-BLOCKERS TALKIN'?

18:03.853 --> 18:06.716
WE'LL FIND OUT IN AN HOUR.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.660
SO YOU CAN'T THINK
OF ANYONE

18:10.660 --> 18:13.663
WHO WOULD WANT TO HURT
YOUR DAUGHTER?
 (voice breaks) NO, I TOLD YOU.

18:13.663 --> 18:16.666
SHE'S A GREAT KID. EVERYBODY
LOVES HER. WHERE IS THAT DOCTOR?

18:16.666 --> 18:19.129
HE'LL BE HERE
AS SOON AS HE CAN.

18:19.129 --> 18:21.201
WAS SHE DATING ANYONE?
 NO.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.802
YOU SURE?

18:22.802 --> 18:25.805
YES, I'M SURE. IF SHE WAS
DATING SOMEBODY, I WOULD KNOW.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.278
HE SAID HE WOULD BE HERE.

18:28.278 --> 18:31.211
MRS. DELFINO, I KNOW
HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS FOR YOU.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.244
REALLY? HAS YOUR DAUGHTER
BEEN ATTACKED?

18:34.244 --> 18:36.246
HEY, UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:36.246 --> 18:39.249
HOW ABOUT WE DO THIS
AFTER SHE TALKS TO THE DOCTOR?

18:39.249 --> 18:40.390
OKAY.

18:42.152 --> 18:44.254
(elevator bell dings)

18:44.254 --> 18:46.396
OH!
 SUSAN! HOW IS SHE?

18:46.396 --> 18:49.829
WE DON'T KNOW YET.
UH, NOBODY'S TALKING TO US.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.131
DO YOU NEED SOMEBODY
TO TAKE CARE OF M.J.?

18:52.131 --> 18:54.264
UH, BOB AND LEE
ARE WATCHING HIM. THANKS.

18:54.264 --> 18:55.535
MRS. DELFINO?

18:55.535 --> 18:58.408
DR. HILL, WHAT IS GOING ON?
 SHE'S STILL UNCONSCIOUS.

18:58.408 --> 19:00.310
I'D LIKE TO RUN SOME TESTS

19:00.310 --> 19:03.343
TO MAKE SURE
THERE'S NO INTERNAL BLEEDING.
 WHAT KIND OF TESTS?

19:03.343 --> 19:06.346
BLOOD WORK, SOME X-RAYS.
 UM, CAN--CAN WE GO WITH YOU?

19:06.346 --> 19:08.348
(Dr. Hill) OF COURSE.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.922
CAN I TALK TO YOU?
 UH, WE REALLY NEED TO MOVE HERE.

19:12.922 --> 19:15.585
I-I-I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
GIVE HER AN X-RAY.

19:15.585 --> 19:18.458
LYNETTE, JUST LET HIM
DO HIS JOB.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.232
JULIE'S PREGNANT.

19:22.232 --> 19:23.433
WHAT?

19:23.433 --> 19:26.396
SHE MIGHT BE.
SHE'S NOT SURE.

19:26.396 --> 19:29.239
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:31.341 --> 19:33.643
SHE TOLD ME.

19:33.643 --> 19:36.806
IT'S NO PROBLEM.
I CAN GIVE HER AN M.R.I.

19:36.806 --> 19:40.350
THERE'S NO RADIATION,
SO IT'S SAFER FOR THE BABY.

19:59.969 --> 20:02.872
HEY, GUYS. WHAT'S UP?

20:02.872 --> 20:05.235
HEY.

20:05.235 --> 20:08.238
UH, WE'RE JUST TAKING SOME FOOD
OVER TO MIKE AND SUSAN'S.

20:08.238 --> 20:11.581
YOU KNOW, WE FEEL SO AWFUL
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
 NICK, YOU TALK TO THE GUYS.

20:11.581 --> 20:14.584
I'M GONNA GET THIS OVER THERE
WHILE IT'S STILL HOT, OKAY?
 OKAY.

20:14.584 --> 20:16.586
SO, NICK, AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
TO JULIE,

20:16.586 --> 20:18.648
WE'RE THINKING OF STARTING UP
A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.

20:18.648 --> 20:20.650
ARE YOU INTERESTED?

20:20.650 --> 20:22.922
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH,
OF COURSE. GREAT.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.994
DANNY MUST BE PRETTY SHAKEN UP.

20:24.994 --> 20:27.497
HE'S--HE'S PRETTY CLOSE
WITH JULIE, ISN'T HE?

20:27.497 --> 20:30.300
I THINK WE'RE ALL
PRETTY SHAKEN UP.

20:30.300 --> 20:33.763
WEREN'T THEY, UH,
DATING, THOUGH?

20:33.763 --> 20:35.435
NO, NO, JUST FRIENDS.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.308
UH, SHE WAS HELPIN' HIM
WITH SOME TUTORING.

20:38.308 --> 20:39.639
REALLY?
 YEAH.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.342
'CAUSE SOME PEOPLE SAW THEM
AT THE MOVIES TOGETHER.

20:42.342 --> 20:45.375
LIKE I SAID, JUST FRIENDS.

20:45.375 --> 20:46.846
OH.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.578
SO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH
THING--

20:48.578 --> 20:50.580
IS THERE, UH,
GONNA BE A MEETING?

20:52.322 --> 20:56.025
YEAH, WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.

20:58.388 --> 21:00.960
IS THIS--IS THIS REALLY ABOUT
THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH?

21:00.960 --> 21:04.634
'CAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY
ONE YOU'RE WATCHING IS MY KID.

21:04.634 --> 21:07.367
(Angie) HONEY!

21:07.367 --> 21:09.369
IT'S YOUR MOTHER.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.841
WE'RE DONE.

21:11.841 --> 21:14.904
RIGHT, GUYS?

21:14.904 --> 21:16.446
THANKS, HON.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.380
THAT, UH, DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
IT WAS GOING SO GOOD.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.382
YEAH, THEY WERE ASKING
ABOUT DANNY.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.384
IT'S LIKE YOU SAID
THEY WOULD.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.987
THEN IT IS TIME
TO GET OUR SON AN ALIBI.

21:32.021 --> 21:33.823
KATHERINE.

21:33.823 --> 21:35.725
I SAW YOU DRIVE IN.

21:35.725 --> 21:38.728
UH, YEAH, I JUST WANTED
TO COME HOME AND TAKE A SHOWER

21:38.728 --> 21:41.030
BEFORE I HEAD BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

21:41.030 --> 21:45.375
LOOK, I KNOW THINGS
HAVE BEEN... AWKWARD LATELY.

21:45.375 --> 21:49.479
BUT I HEARD ABOUT JULIE,
AND I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING.

21:49.479 --> 21:50.910
THANK YOU.

21:50.910 --> 21:54.313
I KNOW
SUSAN WILL APPRECIATE IT.

22:01.090 --> 22:04.794
SO... HOW IS JULIE?

22:04.794 --> 22:07.797
YEAH, WE DON'T KNOW.
THEY'RE STILL DOING TESTS.

22:07.797 --> 22:10.760
OH, GOD. I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

22:14.103 --> 22:16.736
YOU HAVE TO STAY STRONG,
MIKE.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.373
UH... KATHERINE?

22:26.976 --> 22:29.949
WHOA, WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:29.949 --> 22:32.682
JUST LETTING YOU KNOW
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

22:38.588 --> 22:40.590
(singsong voice) ANYTIME.

22:40.590 --> 22:43.463
(door closes)

22:43.463 --> 22:46.466
(Gabrielle) COME ON IN.
 (door closes)

22:46.466 --> 22:48.468
ANA,
THERE ARE TWO DETECTIVES HERE

22:48.468 --> 22:50.900
WHO WANNA ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS.

22:50.900 --> 22:53.072
WHAT ABOUT?

22:53.072 --> 22:55.074
WE'RE INVESTIGATING
THE JULIE MAYER ASSAULT.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.807
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT
AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00?

22:57.807 --> 23:00.480
OH, I CAN ANSWER THAT.
SHE WAS IN HER ROOM.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.482
WE HAVE A VERY STRICT
10:00 P.M. CURFEW.

23:02.482 --> 23:05.154
ACTUALLY, I WAS OUT.

23:05.154 --> 23:08.117
WHAT? I SAW YOU
GO INTO YOUR ROOM.

23:08.117 --> 23:12.422
YEAH, AND THEN I CLIMBED DOWN
THE TRELLIS AND I MET A FRIEND.

23:12.422 --> 23:15.094
CAN I BORROW YOUR MACE?
 PLEASE, MA'AM.

23:15.094 --> 23:18.167
MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR IT.
I SHOULD GET TO USE IT.

23:18.167 --> 23:21.130
WHO WAS THE FRIEND YOU MET?

23:21.130 --> 23:22.932
DANNY BOLEN.

23:22.932 --> 23:24.434
WAIT, DANNY BOLEN?

23:24.434 --> 23:27.076
AS IN THE GUY WHO BLEW YOU OFF
THIS MORNING?

23:27.076 --> 23:30.440
YES. HE'S A FRIEND. I WANT HIM
TO BE MORE THAN A FRIEND.

23:30.440 --> 23:32.912
MR. BOLEN SAID THAT
YOU STOPPED BY A LIQUOR STORE.

23:32.912 --> 23:36.085
NO. NO, NO. SHE'S 16.
SHE DOESN'T DRINK.

23:36.085 --> 23:37.747
YEAH, WE BOUGHT SOME BEER.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.592
HOW ABOUT A TASER?
YOU GUYS MUST CARRY A TASER.

23:42.592 --> 23:45.725
(scoffs) CAN ANYBODY
VERIFY YOUR WHEREABOUTS?

23:45.725 --> 23:48.458
WELL...

23:48.458 --> 23:50.159
DANNY.

23:50.159 --> 23:52.131
OKAY.

23:52.131 --> 23:55.204
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

23:56.506 --> 23:59.008
YOU KNOW WHY KIDS
ARE LIKE THIS NOW?

23:59.008 --> 24:01.741
BECAUSE YOU PEOPLE
WON'T LET US HIT THEM ANYMORE.

24:04.173 --> 24:07.176
(monitor beeping steadily)
 IF I FIND THIS BASTARD
BEFORE THE COPS DO,

24:07.176 --> 24:09.178
HE WON'T NEED A TRIAL

24:09.178 --> 24:11.951
'CAUSE I'LL KILL HIM
WITH MY BARE HANDS.

24:11.951 --> 24:14.954
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE MAD. I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR ANGER IN THIS ROOM.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.527
WE NEED TO STAY POSITIVE
FOR JULIE'S SAKE.

24:17.527 --> 24:19.689
DO WE EVEN HAVE A CLUE
WHO DID THIS?

24:19.689 --> 24:21.991
A JEALOUS BOYFRIEND, MAYBE?

24:21.991 --> 24:23.993
WAS SHE EVEN SEEING ANYONE?

24:23.993 --> 24:27.466
NO, NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.139
(sighs)
HI. IS THIS A BAD TIME?

24:30.139 --> 24:33.773
NO, NO. COME ON IN.
 OH, HOW IS SHE?

24:33.773 --> 24:35.505
STILL UNCONSCIOUS.

24:35.505 --> 24:38.147
WE'RE WAITING
FOR THE TEST RESULTS.

24:38.147 --> 24:40.580
KARL.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.752
BREE.

24:42.752 --> 24:45.515
YOU KNOW,
I NEED TO TALK TO LYNETTE.

24:45.515 --> 24:47.687
I'LL BE BACK IN TEN MINUTES.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.524
SHE MUST NEVER EVER KNOW
I SLEPT WITH YOU.

24:54.524 --> 24:57.026
BREE, MY DAUGHTER
WAS ATTACKED.

24:57.026 --> 25:00.499
I'VE GOT MORE TO WORRY ABOUT
THAN SUSAN GETTING MAD AT US.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.532
OF COURSE. I'M SORRY.

25:04.874 --> 25:08.107
LOOK, I KNOW WE SAID
WE'D GET TOGETHER THIS WEEK,

25:08.107 --> 25:10.610
BUT TILL THIS ALL
GETS SORTED OUT,

25:10.610 --> 25:13.543
I-I NEED A LITTLE TIME.

25:13.543 --> 25:16.185
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

25:19.849 --> 25:23.553
I DO WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

25:23.553 --> 25:26.095
REALLY.

25:26.095 --> 25:27.757
JUST NOT NOW.

25:27.757 --> 25:29.258
OKAY.

25:31.060 --> 25:32.732
MMM.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.133
MMM.

25:39.108 --> 25:40.239
DAD?

25:53.022 --> 25:56.956
SO WHAT DID THEY SAY?
 THE DOCTORS STILL DON'T KNOW.

25:56.956 --> 25:59.258
BUT SHE'S NOT PREGNANT.

25:59.258 --> 26:03.132
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I JUST HAD TO SAY SOMETHING.

26:05.995 --> 26:08.267
WHAT MADE YOU THINK
THAT SHE MIGHT BE?

26:08.267 --> 26:10.800
SHE TOLD ME.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.242
A FEW DAYS AGO,

26:13.242 --> 26:16.145
I WAS OUT IN MY YARD.

26:16.145 --> 26:17.977
I WAS UPSET.

26:17.977 --> 26:20.279
JULIE SAW ME
AND ASKED ME WHAT WAS WRONG.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.112
WE STARTED TALKING
ABOUT STUFF, AND...

26:23.112 --> 26:24.784
IT JUST CAME OUT.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.786
TH--AND YOU DIDN'T JUST...

26:26.786 --> 26:29.258
JUST IMMEDIATELY
PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL ME?

26:29.258 --> 26:31.791
SHE ASKED ME NOT TO.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.770
SO WHO'S THE GUY?

26:40.770 --> 26:43.172
I DON'T KNOW.

26:43.172 --> 26:44.774
SHE DIDN'T SAY?

26:44.774 --> 26:47.276
ALL SHE SAID WAS SHE'D GOTTEN
INVOLVED WITH SOMEONE

26:47.276 --> 26:49.979
AND THAT IT WAS COMPLICATED.

26:49.979 --> 26:52.882
COMPLICATED?
AND THAT'S THE WORD SHE USED?

26:52.882 --> 26:54.714
YEAH.

26:57.186 --> 27:00.319
BECAUSE... "COMPLICATED"
MEANS "TROUBLE,"

27:00.319 --> 27:03.893
SO YOU KNEW THAT SHE WAS
IN TROUBLE,

27:03.893 --> 27:06.926
AND YOU CHOSE
NOT TO COME TO ME?

27:06.926 --> 27:09.398
LIKE I SAID,
JULIE ASKED ME NOT TO.

27:09.398 --> 27:11.400
YOU ARE MY FRIEND,
NOT HERS.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.402
AFTER EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

27:13.402 --> 27:17.206
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU WOULD
BETRAY ME LIKE THAT.
 WHOA, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

27:17.206 --> 27:20.039
LYNETTE, MY DAUGHTER
IS HOOKED UP TO A MACHINE,

27:20.039 --> 27:22.641
AND A GUY WHO IS
 COMPLICATING HER LIFE--

27:22.641 --> 27:25.144
A GUY THAT I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW ABOUT--

27:25.144 --> 27:29.418
MIGHT'VE PUT HER THERE,
SO I DON'T NEED TO BE FAIR.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.122
(sighs)

27:35.284 --> 27:38.157
HEY, REGGIE.
THANKS FOR COMING SO QUICKLY.

27:38.157 --> 27:42.231
NO PROBLEM, MRS. SOLIS. HOW ARE
THOSE TWO LITTLE PRECIOUS ONES?

27:42.231 --> 27:44.363
WHAT?

27:44.363 --> 27:46.295
OH, MY KIDS.

27:46.295 --> 27:48.798
OH, YOU THREW ME OFF
WITH "PRECIOUS."

27:48.798 --> 27:51.040
(chuckles)
 THEY'RE THE LEAST
OF MY PROBLEMS.

27:51.040 --> 27:54.403
WE'VE TAKEN IN A TEENAGER.
 OOH. SORRY TO HEAR IT.

27:54.403 --> 27:56.776
YEAH, SHE'S BEEN USING THIS
TO SNEAK OUT AT NIGHT.

27:56.776 --> 27:59.248
THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU
TO TAKE IT DOWN.

27:59.248 --> 28:02.011
SHE CLIMBED DOWN THIS TRELLIS?
 YEAH, THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

28:02.011 --> 28:05.314
OKAY. IT'S JUST THAT
IT'S PRETTY BEAT UP.

28:05.314 --> 28:08.317
I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT IT COULD
HOLD MUCH MORE THAN THOSE ROSES.

28:08.317 --> 28:10.890
BUT THEN AGAIN,
WHY WOULD SHE LIE?

28:10.890 --> 28:12.321
I'LL GET MY TOOLS.

28:24.703 --> 28:28.307
(sighs)

28:28.307 --> 28:29.338
(crack)

28:29.338 --> 28:30.309
AAH!

28:30.309 --> 28:32.181
(thud)

28:32.181 --> 28:34.313
(dog barking in distance)

28:34.313 --> 28:36.415
I'M TELLING YOU,
SHE OPENED HER EYES

28:36.415 --> 28:39.118
FOR AT LEAST
10 OR 15 SECONDS.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.720
SHE CALLED ME "DAD."
 I BELIEVE YOU.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.722
WELL, WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
 WELL, IN LAYMAN'S TERMS,

28:43.722 --> 28:45.724
DRIFTING IN AND OUT
OF CONSCIOUSNESS

28:45.724 --> 28:47.757
IS BETTER
THAN FULLY COMATOSE.

28:47.757 --> 28:49.759
OUR MAIN CONCERN IS
THE INTRACRANIAL SWELLING.

28:49.759 --> 28:52.932
IN FACT, IF SHE WAKES UP,
WE MAY CHOOSE TO INDUCE COMA.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.935
WELL, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
 THE SWELLING WILL HEAL FASTER
IF SHE'S UNCONSCIOUS.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.967
BUT I'M CONFIDENT
SHE'LL RECOVER.

28:57.967 --> 29:01.110
(sighs) THANK GOD.
I SHOULD FIND SUSAN.

29:01.110 --> 29:03.212
(pager beeping)

29:03.212 --> 29:06.115
GOOD LORD.
THEY NEED ME IN THE E.R.

29:06.115 --> 29:08.117
UM, BEFORE YOU GO,
ONE QUICK QUESTION.

29:08.117 --> 29:11.120
WHEN JULIE WAKES UP, WILL SHE
REMEMBER WHAT SHE SAW OR HEARD

29:11.120 --> 29:13.783
DURING THE BRIEF MOMENT
SHE WAS AWAKE?
 I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

29:13.783 --> 29:17.026
BUT PEOPLE IN COMAS DREAM,
DON'T THEY?

29:17.026 --> 29:19.789
SHE COULD WAKE UP THINKING
SHE SAW SOMETHING ODD

29:19.789 --> 29:22.792
WHEN REALLY IT WAS JUST
A BIZARRE DREAM.
 NOT VERY LIKELY.

29:22.792 --> 29:25.134
HER BRAIN IS SWOLLEN. THAT HAS
TO CAUSE HALLUCINATIONS.

29:25.134 --> 29:27.336
I ONCE THOUGHT LAUREN BACALL
WAS IN MY BEDROOM,

29:27.336 --> 29:30.039
AND THAT WAS JUST
A HIGH FEVER.

29:30.039 --> 29:33.502
MA'AM, THERE'S BEEN A BUS CRASH.
I NEED TO GO.

29:33.502 --> 29:35.875
OH, I'M SORRY.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.877
UH, TALK TO YOUR FRIEND.

29:37.877 --> 29:40.309
YOU MAY BE SURPRISED
WHAT SHE REMEMBERS.

29:44.053 --> 29:46.415
(sighs)

29:48.217 --> 29:49.358
LIAR!

29:49.358 --> 29:51.320
WHAT?

29:51.320 --> 29:54.023
THERE IS NO WAY
YOU CRAWLED DOWN THAT TRELLIS,

29:54.023 --> 29:57.026
BECAUSE I JUST TRIED TO,
AND IT COLLAPSED ON TOP OF ME.

29:57.026 --> 29:59.298
WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER TO THAT?
 I DON'T KNOW.

29:59.298 --> 30:02.902
PULL BACK ON THE CARBS
AND TRY AGAIN IN TWO WEEKS?

30:02.902 --> 30:04.233
WH--

30:04.233 --> 30:06.375
ANA, THIS IS SERIOUS.

30:06.375 --> 30:08.377
WHY WOULD YOU LIE
TO THE COPS?

30:08.377 --> 30:10.880
DID DANNY ASK YOU
TO COVER UP FOR HIM?

30:10.880 --> 30:15.114
I'M NOT COVERING UP ANYTHING.
DANNY DIDN'T DO IT.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.416
WELL, THE POLICE THINK HE DID.
YOU DON'T KNOW THIS KID.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.319
I KNOW HIM BETTER
THAN THE COPS.

30:20.319 --> 30:23.452
YOU'RE JUST MAD BECAUSE
I DIDN'T TAKE YOUR ADVICE.

30:23.452 --> 30:25.895
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

30:25.895 --> 30:29.298
YOU TOLD ME TO PLAY HARD TO GET,
WHICH IS TOTALLY LAME.

30:29.298 --> 30:33.232
I FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO MAKE HIM OWE ME.
 AIDING AND ABETTING?

30:33.232 --> 30:36.565
THIS IS YOUR SOLUTION
ON HOW TO LAND A GUY?

30:36.565 --> 30:39.268
(scoffs)

30:39.268 --> 30:41.270
(beep)
 WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

30:41.270 --> 30:42.611
THE POLICE.
 NO!

30:42.611 --> 30:44.944
JULIE MAYER IS LYING
IN A HOSPITAL BED RIGHT NOW,

30:44.944 --> 30:46.946
AND DANNY MIGHT HAVE
PUT HER THERE.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.948
YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH.

30:54.984 --> 30:56.555
BREE, YOU'RE BACK.

30:56.555 --> 31:00.459
I BROUGHT YOU
YOUR FAVORITE BISCOTTI.
 AW, YOU ARE SO SWEET.

31:00.459 --> 31:03.392
AND I HEAR
JULIE'S DOING BETTER.
 MUCH BETTER.

31:03.392 --> 31:05.864
SHE'S JUST SEDATED NOW.
THE DOCTORS ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.537
OH, MY, THAT IS GOOD NEWS.

31:08.537 --> 31:11.340
YOU KNOW,
I WANTED TO TELL YOU AGAIN

31:11.340 --> 31:13.602
HOW MUCH I ENJOYED
YOUR WEDDING,

31:13.602 --> 31:16.505
ESPECIALLY THE PART WHERE
YOU AND KATHERINE MADE PEACE.

31:16.505 --> 31:19.148
WELL, I'M GLAD SOMEONE
ENJOYED THAT.

31:19.148 --> 31:21.150
BUT YOU ARE FRIENDS AGAIN,
RIGHT?

31:21.150 --> 31:23.983
I MEAN, YOU SAID ALL THOSE
LOVELY THINGS TO HER

31:23.983 --> 31:26.956
IN THE CHURCH.
 YEAH, BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH
FOR KATHERINE.

31:26.956 --> 31:28.958
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE GETS OFF

31:28.958 --> 31:31.460
BEING THE INJURED PARTY.
SHE TOOK MIKE FROM ME FIRST.

31:31.460 --> 31:34.293
BUT YOU AND MIKE WERE DIVORCED
AT THE TIME.

31:34.293 --> 31:37.326
AND--AND KATHERINE
WAS VERY LONELY.

31:37.326 --> 31:39.328
OKAY, RULE NUMBER ONE
OF THE FEMALE CODE--

31:39.328 --> 31:42.201
NEVER SLEEP WITH
YOUR FRIEND'S EX-HUSBAND.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.505
WELL, UH, PERHAPS
SHE SHOULD'VE SEEN

31:46.505 --> 31:48.507
THAT YOU STILL
HAD FEELINGS FOR MIKE.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.679
IT WOULD'VE BEEN DIFFERENT
IF SHE'D SLEPT WITH...

31:50.679 --> 31:53.182
OH, LET'S SAY FOR INSTANCE,
KARL.

31:53.182 --> 31:56.445
KARL? (scoffs) OH, YEAH,
LIKE THAT WOULD EVER HAPPEN.

31:56.445 --> 31:58.447
NO, KATHERINE'S A LADY.

31:58.447 --> 32:00.519
SHE'S NOT ONE
OF THOSE DUMB SKANKS

32:00.519 --> 32:03.322
THAT WOULD FALL
FOR KARL'S COME-ONS.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.925
SO YOU AGREE
IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT?

32:06.925 --> 32:09.028
MUCH DIFFERENT.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.459
WORSE.

32:10.459 --> 32:12.561
WORSE? WHY WORSE?

32:12.561 --> 32:17.466
BECAUSE KARL HURT ME.
HE CHEATED AND LIED.

32:17.466 --> 32:19.438
I MEAN, ANY FRIEND
WHO WOULD KNOW ALL THAT

32:19.438 --> 32:21.670
AND SLEEP WITH HIM ANYWAY?

32:21.670 --> 32:24.713
I WOULD NEVER
TALK TO HER AGAIN.

32:24.713 --> 32:27.476
I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR DEFENDING KATHERINE.

32:27.476 --> 32:29.318
BUT...

32:29.318 --> 32:32.581
I JUST DON'T NEED
A FRIEND LIKE HER IN MY LIFE,

32:32.581 --> 32:35.424
ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE
A FRIEND LIKE YOU.

32:35.424 --> 32:37.126
(chuckles)

32:46.965 --> 32:48.397
(knock on door)

32:48.397 --> 32:51.240
ORSON. COME IN.

32:51.240 --> 32:53.242
UH, I'M GETTING EVERYBODY
TO SIGN A GET WELL CARD.

32:53.242 --> 32:56.345
WE'RE SENDING IT OVER
TO JULIE.
 OH, THAT'S NICE.

32:56.345 --> 32:59.478
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD SIGN IT
SOMEWHERE INCONSPICUOUS,

32:59.478 --> 33:01.480
GIVEN RECENT EVENTS.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.352
OH.

33:03.352 --> 33:04.683
I SUPPOSE.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.355
BY THE WAY,

33:06.355 --> 33:08.357
THIS MORNING WHEN I SAID

33:08.357 --> 33:11.360
THAT MIKE AND SUSAN
WOULDN'T LAST?

33:11.360 --> 33:14.693
I KNOW YOU THOUGHT
I WAS CRAZY.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.365
NO.

33:16.365 --> 33:18.467
I DIDN'T THINK THAT...

33:18.467 --> 33:19.998
EXACTLY.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.330
(closes drawer)

33:21.330 --> 33:24.403
WELL, F.Y.I.,

33:24.403 --> 33:28.077
I STOPPED BY THEIR HOUSE TODAY
WITH A CASSEROLE.

33:28.077 --> 33:31.210
MIKE WAS THERE... ALONE.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.641
OH?

33:32.641 --> 33:35.214
LET'S JUST SAY
HE WAS GRATEFUL.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.786
VERY GRATEFUL.

33:37.786 --> 33:40.389
WHY WOULDN'T HE BE?

33:40.389 --> 33:44.193
GOD, YOU HAVE NO EAR
FOR INNUENDO AT ALL!

33:44.193 --> 33:46.195
HE MADE A PASS AT ME.

33:46.195 --> 33:51.200
WITH JULIE IN THE HOSPITAL
AND HIS MARRIAGE ONE DAY OLD?

33:51.200 --> 33:53.202
WELL...
 (click)

33:53.202 --> 33:55.634
IT MAY BE THE FIRST DAY,
BUT..

33:55.634 --> 33:57.166
(scratch)

33:57.166 --> 34:00.709
HE'S CLEARING HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS.

34:03.572 --> 34:06.044
OH, AND..

34:06.044 --> 34:07.516
PLEASE DON'T TELL BREE.

34:07.516 --> 34:10.219
I'D HATE FOR THIS
TO GET BACK TO SUSAN.

34:15.724 --> 34:17.726
HEY.

34:17.726 --> 34:20.159
HEY.

34:22.291 --> 34:25.164
I HEAR JULIE OPENED HER EYES.
THAT'S GREAT.

34:25.164 --> 34:28.097
YES. YES, IT IS.

34:28.097 --> 34:30.839
I'M SORRY
YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.703
YEAH, I'M NOT MAD.

34:37.146 --> 34:39.678
I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND

34:39.678 --> 34:42.411
WHY SHE WENT TO YOU
INSTEAD OF ME.

34:46.784 --> 34:49.788
THAT DAY
THAT JULIE FOUND ME CRYING?

34:51.820 --> 34:56.565
THE REASON SHE OPENED UP TO ME
WAS BECAUSE I TOLD HER THAT--

34:56.565 --> 34:59.198
AND NO ONE ELSE CAN KNOW
ABOUT THIS--

34:59.198 --> 35:01.530
I'M PREGNANT.

35:01.530 --> 35:03.802
YOU ARE?

35:05.534 --> 35:07.336
THAT'S AMAZING.
 (sighs)

35:07.336 --> 35:09.438
OH! OH.

35:09.438 --> 35:12.241
WAIT. WHY WERE YOU CRYING?

35:12.241 --> 35:14.243
OH... PFFT.

35:14.243 --> 35:17.416
LET'S SEE.
UH, I'M IN MY 40s,

35:17.416 --> 35:19.548
MY HUSBAND
IS BACK IN SCHOOL,

35:19.548 --> 35:22.491
I'M THE SOLE BREADWINNER,

35:22.491 --> 35:25.894
I DON'T KNOW HOW

35:25.894 --> 35:29.158
I'M GONNA DO
THIS WHOLE BABY THING AGAIN,

35:29.158 --> 35:30.629
AND...

35:30.629 --> 35:34.563
ALSO BECAUSE...

35:34.563 --> 35:37.206
WHAT?

35:41.370 --> 35:45.474
BECAUSE I CAN'T QUIET
THAT ONE VOICE IN MY MIND

35:45.474 --> 35:47.646
THAT KEEPS SAYING...

35:53.452 --> 35:56.785
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T.

36:00.789 --> 36:03.432
OH, HONEY.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.566
YEAH.

36:11.740 --> 36:14.873
LYNETTE, UH...

36:14.873 --> 36:19.408
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU THINK
IT IS YOU NEED TO DO.

36:19.408 --> 36:21.510
YEAH.

36:21.510 --> 36:23.412
I KNOW.

36:23.412 --> 36:25.514
LUCKY ME.

36:26.815 --> 36:31.320
IT'S WEIRD. EVERYBODY TALKS
ABOUT A KID BEING A GIFT.

36:31.320 --> 36:34.323
IT'S THE ONLY GIFT WHERE
YOU PUKE FOR NINE MONTHS

36:34.323 --> 36:37.326
BEFORE YOU RECEIVE IT AND THEN
SCREAM THE DAY IT ARRIVES.

36:37.326 --> 36:38.467
(laughs)

36:38.467 --> 36:40.369
(sniffles) THAT'S TRUE.

36:40.369 --> 36:42.871
BUT THEY ARE A GIFT,
LYNETTE.

36:45.974 --> 36:51.540
I KNOW THAT BECAUSE...

36:51.540 --> 36:54.843
I SPENT THE LAST FEW HOURS
THINKING THAT I WAS...

36:54.843 --> 36:58.447
(voice breaks)
GONNA LOSE MINE.

36:58.447 --> 37:02.220
I REALIZED THAT I WOULD...

37:02.220 --> 37:03.522
TRADE EVERYTHING I OWN,

37:03.522 --> 37:06.325
I WOULD GIVE EVERYTHING
I EVER WILL HAVE,

37:06.325 --> 37:12.661
FOR JUST ONE MORE DAY
AS JULIE'S MOM.

37:12.661 --> 37:15.504
AW.

37:17.636 --> 37:20.769
BUT I'M NOT TELLING YOU
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

37:23.011 --> 37:25.013
ACTUALLY, YOU ARE.

37:28.917 --> 37:31.820
AND I'M GLAD YOU DID.

37:34.523 --> 37:35.854
(sighs)

37:47.366 --> 37:50.899
(indistinct conversations)

37:50.899 --> 37:52.901
I HAD SOME BRIEFS TO FINISH,

37:52.901 --> 37:55.444
BUT I'D RATHER WORK HERE
THAN AT THE OFFICE.

37:55.444 --> 37:57.746
HEY, BREE.
YOU'RE STILL HERE?

37:57.746 --> 38:00.809
(cell phone ringing)
 OH, SHE'S KEPT ME COMPANY
ALL DAY. IS SHE A SAINT OR WHAT?

38:00.809 --> 38:03.482
MM.
 HEY, LEE.
THANKS FOR CALLING ME BACK.

38:03.482 --> 38:06.655
UH, I'M JUST CHECKING ON M.J.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.394
THIS HAS BEEN
THE LONGEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

38:18.567 --> 38:22.601
I THOUGHT I NEEDED
SOME TIME TO MYSELF.

38:22.601 --> 38:26.034
I WAS WRONG.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.608
I-I NEED YOU.

38:33.081 --> 38:35.484
(speaking inaudibly)

38:35.484 --> 38:38.487
I BOOKED OUR ROOM
AT THE MOTEL.

38:38.487 --> 38:41.420
HERE'S THE KEY.

38:43.452 --> 38:47.496
IF YOU COULD COME BY,
EVEN FOR JUST AN HOUR...

38:47.496 --> 38:49.998
WELL, IT WOULD MEAN A LOT
TO ME.

38:53.502 --> 38:57.005
(speaking inaudibly)

38:59.007 --> 39:01.570
PLEASE.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.645
I-I DON'T WANT
TO BE ALONE TONIGHT.

39:15.624 --> 39:18.787
NEITHER DO I.

39:21.730 --> 39:24.593
(dog barking in distance)

39:24.593 --> 39:27.396
HEY, GABY.
 HEY, YOU GOT A MINUTE?

39:27.396 --> 39:29.398
OH, I THINK I KNOW
WHY YOU'RE HERE,

39:29.398 --> 39:31.470
AND BELIEVE ME,
I AM AS TICKED OFF AS YOU ARE.
 ANGIE--

39:31.470 --> 39:32.971
NO, NO, NO, NO.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.973
DANNY SHOULD'VE NEVER
KEPT YOUR NIECE OUT SO LATE.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.975
WHEN I FOUND OUT,
I KICKED HIM SO HARD,

39:36.975 --> 39:39.908
HE'S STILL TRYING
TO GET THE SHOE OUT OF HIS BUTT.

39:39.908 --> 39:41.750
IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
 IT NEVER HAPPENED AT ALL.

39:41.750 --> 39:45.414
WHAT?
 ANA WASN'T WITH DANNY LAST
NIGHT. SHE NEVER LEFT THE HOUSE.

39:45.414 --> 39:47.416
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

39:47.416 --> 39:51.019
SHE SNUCK OUT. DANNY BOUGHT
HER BEER. THEY BOTH FESSED UP.
 ANA WAS LYING.

39:51.019 --> 39:52.921
WELL, WHY WOULD SHE LIE?

39:52.921 --> 39:55.824
BECAUSE YOUR SON
TOLD HER TO.

39:55.824 --> 39:58.527
WELL, MAYBE SHE WAS
CHANGING HER TUNE

39:58.527 --> 40:01.099
'CAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO GET IN TROUBLE WITH YOU.

40:01.099 --> 40:03.702
NO. NO!
SHE'S COVERING FOR DANNY.

40:03.702 --> 40:06.605
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
IMPLYING, BUT HE'S A GOOD KID.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.607
YOUR NIECE IS THE ONE

40:08.607 --> 40:10.609
THAT'S BEEN HOUNDING HIM
DAY AND NIGHT.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.611
HEY, I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE NICE HERE.

40:12.611 --> 40:15.544
I'M GIVING YOU A HEADS UP THAT
ANA'S TAKING HER STORY BACK.

40:15.544 --> 40:18.517
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
LET'S SLOW DOWN HERE, OKAY?

40:18.517 --> 40:21.089
CAN I AT LEAST
TALK TO THE GIRL

40:21.089 --> 40:23.091
BEFORE SHE GOES
POINTIN' FINGERS?

40:23.091 --> 40:25.594
TOO LATE. SHE'S TALKING
TO THE POLICE RIGHT NOW.

40:25.594 --> 40:28.497
(sighs)

40:37.566 --> 40:40.669
(male announcer
speaking indistinctly on TV)

40:40.669 --> 40:43.912
BABY, I SCREWED UP.

40:43.912 --> 40:46.715
WHAT HAPPENED?
 (sighs)
I NEVER SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU

40:46.715 --> 40:49.848
TO ASK THAT GIRL FOR AN ALIBI.
 DID SHE TALK TO THE COPS?

40:49.848 --> 40:52.721
YEAH, WHICH MEANS
THEY SHOULD BE HERE ANY SECOND.
 BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. I--

40:52.721 --> 40:55.684
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT.
YOU'RE A SUSPECT.

40:55.684 --> 40:57.956
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT
TO QUESTION YOU.
 MA...

40:57.956 --> 40:59.658
JUST LISTEN TO ME.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.690
TELL 'EM YOU WILL NOT WAIVE
YOUR MIRANDA RIGHTS.

41:01.690 --> 41:03.962
AND WE WILL HAVE A LAWYER
DOWN THERE AS SOON AS WE CAN.

41:03.962 --> 41:07.696
REMEMBER, HOW DOES A FISH
GET CAUGHT?
 HE OPENS HIS MOUTH.

41:07.696 --> 41:09.938
CALLED THIRD STRIKE
ON THE CORNER...

41:13.071 --> 41:15.774
(Mary Alice)
IT HAD BEEN A HORRIBLE DAY,

41:15.774 --> 41:18.106
AND PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

41:18.106 --> 41:20.849
WERE DOING THEIR BEST
TO RECOVER.

41:20.849 --> 41:25.183
ONE MOTHER WAS ABOUT TO SHARE
SOME GOOD NEWS WITH HER FAMILY

41:25.183 --> 41:30.589
WHEN HER SON SAW
A FLASHING LIGHT IN THE WINDOW.

41:30.589 --> 41:33.862
ANOTHER WAS BUSY
GROUNDING HER NIECE

41:33.862 --> 41:39.698
WHEN SHE NOTICED THE POLICE CAR
PULLING UP ACROSS THE STREET

41:39.698 --> 41:44.733
A WOMAN WAS PLANNING
A RENDEZVOUS WITH HER LOVER

41:44.733 --> 41:49.077
WHEN SHE SAW A YOUNG MAN
BEING TAKEN OUT OF HIS HOUSE.

41:54.012 --> 41:58.647
WITHIN MOMENTS,
EVERYONE HAD HEARD

41:58.647 --> 42:01.189
THE SON OF ONE HOUSEWIFE

42:01.189 --> 42:05.854
WAS SUSPECTED OF STRANGLING
THE DAUGHTER OF ANOTHER.

42:17.205 --> 42:21.570
YES,
IT HAD BEEN A HORRIBLE DAY.

42:21.570 --> 42:24.542
AND THE THOUGHT OCCURRED
TO ONE OLD WOMAN--

42:24.542 --> 42:28.747
THE DAYS AHEAD COULD BE WORSE.
