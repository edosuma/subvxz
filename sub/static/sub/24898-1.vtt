00:01.467 --> 00:03.466
Welcome back to Hollywood Plus.

00:03.467 --> 00:05.677
We have a huge exclusive
for you tonight.

00:05.702 --> 00:06.717
Harley Carter,

00:06.742 --> 00:09.271
star of TV's number one
detective drama Call Carter,

00:09.363 --> 00:11.868
and his wife, actress and
supermodel Winter Wood,

00:11.893 --> 00:14.088
have been the faces
of happily-ever-after

00:14.127 --> 00:16.260
here in Tinseltown for
almost five years,

00:16.779 --> 00:18.347
until right here in Malibu,

00:18.381 --> 00:20.301
Harley went after Steven Gattner,

00:20.489 --> 00:22.091
his long-time friend and co-star,

00:22.116 --> 00:25.111
in what can only be called
a red carpet bloodbath.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.057
Steve! Come here.

00:27.557 --> 00:28.757
Hey, come here.

00:28.791 --> 00:30.035
Steve, come here. Why are you running?

00:30.059 --> 00:31.174
First, you sleep with my wife?

00:31.198 --> 00:32.598
And then you come to my wrap party?

00:35.398 --> 00:36.598
You slept with my wife!

00:36.633 --> 00:38.251
I didn't touch Winter!

00:39.888 --> 00:42.884
Does this Malibu meltdown
signal the end of Harley-wood?

00:42.939 --> 00:45.640
I saw you! You were naked!

00:45.665 --> 00:47.140
I didn't touch her!

00:47.165 --> 00:49.539
Yes, you did! I saw your penis!

00:52.739 --> 00:53.755
Hello.

00:55.005 --> 00:56.012
Who?

00:56.653 --> 00:57.986
Vijay Gill?

00:59.712 --> 01:01.579
I didn't even know I had a junior agent.

01:02.634 --> 01:03.661
Well, I'm at the beach.

01:05.177 --> 01:07.708
Oh, Beverly Hills, 10:00 a.m.?

01:08.496 --> 01:10.130
Yeah, I'm not going to
be able to make that.

01:10.154 --> 01:12.043
See, I'm at the beach in Canada.

01:13.557 --> 01:15.237
Okay, you know what,
let me talk to Rhonda.

01:18.041 --> 01:20.475
Yeah, well, tell her I don't
want to talk to her either.

01:20.510 --> 01:21.549
Thanks.

01:22.679 --> 01:24.579
The question on everyone's mind:

01:24.614 --> 01:26.648
What's the next move for Harley Carter?

01:26.683 --> 01:28.180
I saw your penis!

01:28.384 --> 01:29.518
Stay tuned.

01:59.999 --> 02:02.338
Duck, one, two. Hands up.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.841
Duck, one, two. Hands up.

02:04.866 --> 02:06.337
Nice, crisp punches, give me six.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.437
One, two, three, four, five, six.

02:08.634 --> 02:10.235
Let's go. Empty the gas tank.
Here we go.

02:10.259 --> 02:11.560
Push. Let's go. Push.

02:12.176 --> 02:13.441
Sam!

02:14.706 --> 02:16.496
We're done. We're done.

02:17.951 --> 02:20.451
I don't understand why you
spend so much time here.

02:20.505 --> 02:21.888
I can't understand why you don't.

02:22.882 --> 02:23.943
That's why we carry this.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.112
You missed the morning briefing again.

02:26.185 --> 02:27.436
Family drama.

02:27.461 --> 02:29.261
Speaking of, Chief wants
you at Beach Four.

02:29.677 --> 02:30.874
For family drama?

02:31.080 --> 02:32.609
There's been a Harley Carter sighting.

02:33.351 --> 02:35.171
Harley Carter's at the beach?

02:35.478 --> 02:36.988
Wait. Harley Carter's in town?

02:37.359 --> 02:39.090
Yeah, I assumed you'd already know that.

02:40.950 --> 02:42.058
One more round.

02:46.861 --> 02:48.391
Oh, my God, you're him. Aren't you?

02:49.004 --> 02:51.067
If by "Him", you mean me,

02:51.092 --> 02:53.637
then yes, I am him.

02:53.662 --> 02:55.340
Hey, everybody, it's Charlie Carter!

02:56.080 --> 02:58.300
Come on. It's actually...

02:58.479 --> 03:01.726
Charlie Carter is the character I play.
I'm Harley Carter.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.624
You're a lot taller on TV.

03:03.687 --> 03:05.847
Yeah, well, I lose a couple
feet when I'm sitting down.

03:05.966 --> 03:07.725
At least I have a couple feet to lose.

03:08.167 --> 03:11.209
Why don't you stand up then
so I can knock you down?

03:11.234 --> 03:13.381
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I don't fight hobbits, okay?

03:13.507 --> 03:15.731
They're notorious nut punchers.

03:16.036 --> 03:17.692
Did you actually just call me a hobbit?

03:21.975 --> 03:24.998
I am so sorry.
I always miss on the first take.

03:25.023 --> 03:26.795
It's just lemonade.
Yeah, it's just stinging.

03:26.820 --> 03:28.068
Dude, get away from her!

03:30.310 --> 03:32.552
Hello, Shane. Is it me?

03:32.577 --> 03:35.287
Or is all this just a little déjà vu-y?

03:35.424 --> 03:36.636
What do you think my father would say

03:36.660 --> 03:38.360
if he found out you pulled a gun on me?

03:38.527 --> 03:40.174
He'll ask me why I
didn't pull the trigger,

03:40.198 --> 03:43.033
save him some college money.
Step away from the movie star.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.914
- TV.
- Oh, I know.

03:45.832 --> 03:47.332
Show's over, everybody.

03:49.708 --> 03:50.794
Sam!

03:51.640 --> 03:52.653
Ow!

03:52.678 --> 03:53.690
Why didn't you call?

03:53.715 --> 03:56.440
I was going to. But somebody
threw my phone in the lake.

03:57.050 --> 04:00.223
Can I give you a ride somewhere,
away from your adoring public?

04:00.248 --> 04:02.416
Yeah, sure, I'm staying at the Westin.

04:02.989 --> 04:04.352
Why aren't you staying at your house?

04:04.376 --> 04:07.284
Well, I didn't want the Yasudas
to think I was kicking them out.

04:07.309 --> 04:10.385
My God, you're afraid of
your own housekeepers.

04:10.410 --> 04:12.211
Um, everyone's afraid
of my housekeepers.

04:12.236 --> 04:14.304
All right, come on, I'll
buy you a cup of coffee.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.285
- Need a hand with that?
- Nah, I got it.

04:22.310 --> 04:23.417
- You sure?
- Yep.

04:27.547 --> 04:29.769
So, you want to talk about
what happened with Winter?

04:29.909 --> 04:31.355
You know what I did when I walked in

04:31.380 --> 04:33.527
on my wife and that guy?

04:35.245 --> 04:36.253
Nothing.

04:37.073 --> 04:38.433
So, I just backed out of the room,

04:38.458 --> 04:39.693
sat on my couch for a while

04:39.718 --> 04:41.786
and finally got up and
went to catch a movie.

04:42.529 --> 04:45.099
America's greatest detective
never saw the clues?

04:46.932 --> 04:49.946
You know, when I was in high school...

04:49.971 --> 04:51.190
When we were in high school...

04:51.750 --> 04:54.104
And I wanted to know if somebody
was a good guy or a bad guy,

04:54.128 --> 04:57.230
we'd just ask you.
And you were always right, always.

04:57.720 --> 04:58.759
And you missed this?

04:59.313 --> 05:03.099
It's Hollywood.
My spidey sense was going off 24/7.

05:03.130 --> 05:04.224
Everyone's faking something.

05:04.248 --> 05:05.974
You just get used to it after a while.

05:08.419 --> 05:09.794
It's really good to see you, Sam.

05:10.689 --> 05:13.216
It's good to see you too.
Call ahead next time.

05:13.319 --> 05:14.392
I would have.

05:14.417 --> 05:16.026
It's just that we haven't
really talked that much

05:16.050 --> 05:20.153
since that Christmas party
at your place. I got to ask.

05:20.178 --> 05:23.374
Did... Did something happen that night?

05:24.021 --> 05:25.287
You don't remember?

05:25.312 --> 05:27.413
I remember screaming "Hey, mistletoe"

05:27.488 --> 05:31.124
and then maybe saying something
kind of drunk-y, sleazy.

05:31.149 --> 05:33.824
Wow, it's not like you to forget things.

05:33.863 --> 05:35.449
Vodka is my kryptonite.

05:35.474 --> 05:38.884
I'm a little hurt that you don't
remember the rest of that night.

05:38.919 --> 05:42.144
Rest of the night?
So, something did happen?

05:42.169 --> 05:44.009
Well, nothing memorable, apparently.

05:44.034 --> 05:46.636
Well, Sam, come on.
You can't leave me hanging like...

05:46.660 --> 05:47.689
This is Detective Shaw.

05:48.853 --> 05:49.897
What's the address?

05:51.172 --> 05:53.473
I know where that is.
I'm 15 minutes out.

05:53.531 --> 05:54.547
Where we going?

05:54.902 --> 05:56.525
We're not going anywhere.
I'm going to work.

05:56.549 --> 05:58.509
But I'll have somebody
give you a lift from there.

05:59.024 --> 06:00.051
'Kay.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.119
Hey, is there going to be
press at this crime scene?

06:02.143 --> 06:03.942
'Cause I got some lemonade on my shorts.

06:10.717 --> 06:12.618
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey,
hey, stay in the car.

06:12.652 --> 06:14.280
I've seen my share of crime scenes.

06:14.347 --> 06:17.466
Harley, this isn't a set.
Stay in the car. And be quiet.

06:25.684 --> 06:26.832
You got here fast.

06:26.867 --> 06:29.031
Yeah, I was in the neighbourhood
when the call came in.

06:29.372 --> 06:30.773
This is the Childress house, right?

06:30.798 --> 06:33.407
Victim's male, late 50s, early 60s,

06:33.918 --> 06:35.251
single gunshot wound to the head.

06:35.602 --> 06:37.740
Poor guy was strapped to a chair.
He never stood a chance.

06:37.764 --> 06:38.878
Was it Childress?

06:38.912 --> 06:41.514
Yeah, his daughter Abigail called it in.

06:41.548 --> 06:43.764
She's not saying much yet.
She took a knock to the head.

06:43.850 --> 06:45.417
- Home invasion?
- Robbery,

06:45.761 --> 06:47.362
looks like a safe's
been cleaned out.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.991
Daughter confirmed it contained cash,

06:49.029 --> 06:50.496
some high-end jewellery, apparently.

07:01.115 --> 07:03.803
Oh, Sam, is this a thing up here now?

07:03.837 --> 07:06.098
Decorating your yard with tiny,
little hate crimes?

07:06.123 --> 07:08.390
You can't just wander
onto a crime scene.

07:08.441 --> 07:09.647
You think I want to be here?

07:09.689 --> 07:11.056
I'd way rather be taking a nap

07:11.411 --> 07:13.546
or having one of those
little butter tarts

07:13.580 --> 07:16.382
from Bronwyn's Bakery.
Tell me Bronwyn's is still open.

07:16.416 --> 07:19.024
Ooh, no, they closed in 2015.

07:19.555 --> 07:21.110
All right, well, nap it is.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.954
Okay, I'm having one of the
uniforms take you to the Westin.

07:23.979 --> 07:26.702
Okay, well, is it cool if I leave
my rental car at the beach?

07:27.349 --> 07:28.746
- You have a rental car?
- Yeah.

07:28.771 --> 07:30.038
Why was I driving you?

07:30.211 --> 07:31.820
I thought it'd give us a chance to hang.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.834
Oh, my God, I was chauffeuring you.

07:34.868 --> 07:37.406
You know I hate to drive.
Plus: quality time.

07:37.711 --> 07:40.339
Just go. And I will call you later.

07:40.531 --> 07:43.250
All right, good luck
with your crime scene.

08:27.854 --> 08:29.890
Hey, Harley, got a second?

08:30.924 --> 08:32.356
Get off our property!

08:35.495 --> 08:36.629
Go! Go! Go! Go!

08:36.663 --> 08:37.780
She's got a gun!

08:40.602 --> 08:41.625
Ah!

08:44.357 --> 08:45.560
I made coffee.

08:46.654 --> 08:47.717
Hi, Dot.

08:52.016 --> 08:53.183
It's great to see you guys.

08:53.208 --> 08:55.653
And I super appreciate how
you've taken care of the place.

08:56.067 --> 08:58.784
But we really need to dial
back the shooting at people.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.095
_

09:02.610 --> 09:05.144
_

09:05.169 --> 09:08.417
_

09:08.795 --> 09:12.368
Harley, you're like a son to us.

09:14.625 --> 09:16.892
_

09:17.244 --> 09:19.072
Guys, you know I speak Japanese, right?

09:20.981 --> 09:22.231
I'm kidding. I don't.

09:22.256 --> 09:24.802
Look, if you're worried about
the living arrangements,

09:24.931 --> 09:27.466
don't be. I'm only here to
get my head on straight.

09:27.547 --> 09:29.982
Hell, you guys have lived
here longer than I have.

09:30.016 --> 09:33.995
My house is your house,
but not legally your house.

09:34.068 --> 09:38.097
I still own it. I'll be in
my old room in the cabin.

09:38.122 --> 09:40.890
Harley, about that, we have a nephew.

09:40.956 --> 09:43.127
Who's coming to visit soon.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.438
Dot, Dot, Dot.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.231
You are famous. People are crazy.

09:51.352 --> 09:52.952
Okay, you know what, if I smell trouble,

09:53.118 --> 09:55.214
I'll work in the phrase
"Blow his head off"

09:55.239 --> 09:56.284
into the conversation.

09:56.309 --> 09:58.378
And that'll be your cue
to blow his head off.

10:04.635 --> 10:06.473
Oh, come on in.

10:11.530 --> 10:14.615
Oh, no, they cancelled
my show, didn't they?

10:15.444 --> 10:18.247
We have a warrant for the
arrest of Koji Yasuda.

10:19.269 --> 10:22.331
"Koji"? On what charge?

10:22.484 --> 10:24.198
Suspicion of murder.

10:36.778 --> 10:38.314
I'm sorry. Who is this again?

10:38.423 --> 10:40.150
Seriously? This is what we're doing?

10:40.184 --> 10:42.112
Look, you're the one who
waltzed into my station,

10:42.137 --> 10:43.440
expecting preferential treatment

10:43.465 --> 10:45.066
because of who you supposedly are.

10:48.742 --> 10:51.040
This is your life? I am so sorry.

10:51.065 --> 10:52.475
Harley, he's not going to talk to you

10:52.499 --> 10:55.756
about an open investigation,
or anything, apparently.

10:57.534 --> 10:59.436
Wait. Wait. Wait. Where are you going?

11:01.951 --> 11:03.196
I want to know why you think Koji

11:03.220 --> 11:04.622
had something to do with this.

11:05.949 --> 11:08.076
Aside from the fact that the
gun we found at the scene

11:08.119 --> 11:10.457
was registered in his name?
Ballistics are in.

11:10.831 --> 11:13.423
The bullet that killed Albert
Childress matches his gun.

11:13.745 --> 11:15.318
- Someone could have stole it.
- Harley.

11:15.470 --> 11:17.171
No, please, Detective, allow me.

11:17.314 --> 11:19.834
We also have a witness who
overheard a verbal altercation

11:19.859 --> 11:22.252
between Koji Yasuda and Albert Childress

11:22.277 --> 11:24.197
- two days before the murder.
- Koji allegedly...

11:25.486 --> 11:28.330
"Stay away from my family or
I'll kill you." That's a quote.

11:29.306 --> 11:30.509
What does Koji say?

11:31.018 --> 11:33.735
That information is found under
none of your damn business.

11:34.399 --> 11:35.431
Sir?

11:37.184 --> 11:38.741
Everyone will know by tomorrow.

11:42.968 --> 11:44.973
Koji confessed, Harl.

11:46.576 --> 11:48.067
He didn't even try to deny it.

12:02.481 --> 12:04.315
That's the victim's daughter.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.083
It's not like it is on TV, is it?

12:07.054 --> 12:11.538
Funny, I was just thinking it's
exactly like it is in the show.

12:11.563 --> 12:14.556
I mean, I'm sitting here
literally thinking she is good.

12:14.581 --> 12:16.220
She's got a real future ahead of her.

12:16.767 --> 12:19.887
Harley, her father is dead.

12:21.339 --> 12:22.543
I know.

12:25.246 --> 12:26.306
Here's the thing.

12:26.331 --> 12:28.165
If I can look at this
like it's my TV show,

12:28.190 --> 12:29.806
maybe we can figure this out.

12:30.390 --> 12:32.488
Is it that Harley or
Charlie Carter talking?

12:32.513 --> 12:34.399
Because, either way, it's terrifying.

12:34.682 --> 12:36.404
I need to talk to Koji.

12:36.487 --> 12:38.240
You need to not walk into my workplace

12:38.265 --> 12:39.567
and mouth off to my boss.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.489
Sam, this is Koji, okay?

12:41.514 --> 12:43.754
The same Koji who gave
me the most awkward

12:43.779 --> 12:46.767
birds and bees conversation
in the history of awkward,

12:46.832 --> 12:47.931
when I was 19.

12:47.990 --> 12:51.119
Harley, there are rules.
This is a police station.

12:51.178 --> 12:53.391
I know. I picked up on that immediately.

12:54.325 --> 12:57.062
Look, Sam, when my mom went...

12:59.097 --> 13:00.263
When my mom died,

13:01.251 --> 13:02.936
my grandparents didn't
have the slightest idea

13:02.960 --> 13:04.622
what to do with a 12-year-old boy.

13:05.051 --> 13:09.021
It was Dot and Koji who
really stepped up.

13:10.784 --> 13:11.784
I owe them.

13:13.845 --> 13:14.854
I love them.

13:18.122 --> 13:19.138
Damn it.

13:20.799 --> 13:22.205
I know you didn't do this.

13:24.088 --> 13:25.463
I did it. I killed him.

13:25.663 --> 13:28.299
What? Why?

13:28.611 --> 13:31.012
I do not need a reason.
I'm a bad-ass sicko.

13:31.696 --> 13:34.341
So, you knew this guy?

13:34.507 --> 13:38.076
I hate him. Craziness comes
over me just thinking about him.

13:40.407 --> 13:42.704
All right, Koji, so,
you killed this guy.

13:42.729 --> 13:44.469
Tell us how it all went down.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.687
It's all a blankness.

13:48.124 --> 13:49.724
Well, tell us what you do remember.

13:49.814 --> 13:52.950
I remember he was there.

13:52.975 --> 13:53.984
Where?

13:54.019 --> 13:55.464
There, where he was.

13:57.136 --> 13:59.058
Words were spoken, then...

14:00.189 --> 14:02.654
- blankness.
- What words, Koji?

14:02.679 --> 14:05.758
I don't remember.
The blankness include the words.

14:06.140 --> 14:07.998
Okay, time's up.

14:08.033 --> 14:09.953
I'll be back. Try and remember that.

14:18.243 --> 14:19.843
He doesn't even know
where the murder happened.

14:19.867 --> 14:22.402
I know. His story is a bucketful
of nuts. But he confessed.

14:24.262 --> 14:27.317
We need to be careful
how we move forward.

14:28.081 --> 14:29.581
So, we are moving forward.

14:32.417 --> 14:35.859
Okay, I think it's time I had
a heart-to-heart with Dot.

14:35.894 --> 14:36.901
Yeah.

14:40.451 --> 14:43.167
So, you're saying he did do it?
Koji went out and shot that guy?

14:43.201 --> 14:44.301
I didn't say that.

14:44.674 --> 14:46.070
You didn't say he didn't.

14:46.104 --> 14:48.315
- Yes.
- Yes what?

14:48.456 --> 14:50.784
Yes, I didn't say he did or didn't.

14:53.290 --> 14:54.645
What is your problem?

14:54.679 --> 14:56.710
Dot, this is your husband
we're talking about.

14:56.735 --> 14:58.222
I know Koji is.

14:58.417 --> 15:00.941
Dot, you got to tell me what you know.

15:01.691 --> 15:03.172
The real killer is still out there.

15:03.197 --> 15:04.633
What if they kill someone else?

15:04.658 --> 15:07.320
The police are probably not
even looking for other suspects.

15:10.183 --> 15:13.009
Someone other than Koji should
be sitting in that cell.

15:13.111 --> 15:15.373
And I need your help to put them there.

15:17.912 --> 15:21.165
All right, you know what,
you play your game.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.368
I'll play mine.

15:23.642 --> 15:28.045
On a completely separate note,
I found these Chucks in my room,

15:28.070 --> 15:29.604
along with a lot of underwear.

15:29.709 --> 15:31.691
Please don't buy me
underwear, okay, Dot?

15:31.716 --> 15:33.630
That's, like, a personal
shopping experience

15:33.655 --> 15:35.286
and not your responsibility.

15:35.637 --> 15:38.371
But I am going to keep the
Chucks because they're sweet.

15:47.448 --> 15:49.253
Usually, we just rent cars.

15:49.753 --> 15:52.170
Yeah, well, today,
I'm renting you with the car.

15:53.925 --> 15:55.365
So, why are we going to the morgue?

15:56.045 --> 15:57.488
We are going to the morgue

15:57.513 --> 16:00.194
because it's the first thing
you do in a case like this.

16:01.313 --> 16:02.913
I'm going to ask the medical examiner

16:02.947 --> 16:04.748
if there are any irregularities.

16:04.783 --> 16:08.024
And he or she is going to say "Oh,
there's this one thing."

16:08.251 --> 16:09.286
The next thing you know,

16:09.321 --> 16:13.106
I'm solving the case and having
pretend sex with Lucy Liu.

16:14.208 --> 16:15.591
"Lucy Liu", huh?

16:16.692 --> 16:19.146
Best pretend sex I ever had.

16:22.130 --> 16:23.966
I thought you wanted to see a dead body.

16:24.930 --> 16:26.611
Well, yeah, but not
just some random one.

16:26.706 --> 16:28.128
Isn't this research for your show?

16:28.153 --> 16:30.526
- What body did you want to see?
- Albert Childress.

16:30.551 --> 16:33.279
Heck no, that body is part
of an ongoing investigation.

16:33.304 --> 16:34.461
I can't just show it to you.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.314
I got a roofer who fell off a barn.
I could show you him.

16:37.601 --> 16:39.441
Why would I want to see a dead roofer?

16:39.466 --> 16:42.347
No, I just want to know if
there were any irregularities

16:42.372 --> 16:43.630
in the Childress corpse.

16:43.724 --> 16:45.647
All irregularities go in my report.

16:46.202 --> 16:48.692
Well, any irregularities that
didn't go in your report?

16:48.727 --> 16:53.526
Like, uhh, weird tattoos or
butterfly cocoon in the mouth?

16:54.714 --> 16:55.785
Seriously?

16:56.120 --> 16:57.425
Hey!

16:57.736 --> 17:01.171
People can't just walk in off
the street to gawk at corpses.

17:01.206 --> 17:03.174
Sorry, Sam. I knew he
was a friend of yours.

17:03.199 --> 17:05.534
And he said he was working with you.
It won't happen again.

17:05.559 --> 17:07.275
It's okay. My car's parked in the back.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.846
He was never here. I owe you a drink.

17:09.097 --> 17:11.511
Friday night, you can explain
to me what just happened.

17:11.901 --> 17:12.915
Yes.

17:16.830 --> 17:18.347
So, no irregularities?

17:18.816 --> 17:19.830
What?

17:19.856 --> 17:21.406
Well, this is the part where
you're supposed to say

17:21.431 --> 17:22.921
"It's probably nothing but."

17:24.835 --> 17:25.858
Well...

17:26.039 --> 17:27.068
Really?

17:28.099 --> 17:30.293
It's not nothing. It's
pretty significant.

17:30.318 --> 17:33.370
And it's in my report, of course.
But it is unusual.

17:33.405 --> 17:34.581
I'll be the judge of that.

17:34.606 --> 17:36.018
Actually, I'll be the judge of that.

17:36.042 --> 17:37.074
We'll be co-judges.

17:37.108 --> 17:38.448
It's the victim's wrists.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.993
Did anyone else just
hear the dramatic music?

17:42.018 --> 17:43.046
What about his wrists?

17:43.081 --> 17:45.028
There were ligature
marks, but no abrasions,

17:45.053 --> 17:46.316
nothing to indicate a struggle.

17:46.351 --> 17:47.918
Well, he had a gun pointed at him.

17:47.952 --> 17:50.352
True, but it's human
nature to test the bonds,

17:50.399 --> 17:51.794
to see if there's any wiggle room.

17:51.825 --> 17:53.016
Interesting.

17:54.048 --> 17:56.727
Are you suggesting that that
actually means something to you?

17:56.844 --> 17:59.305
No, but aren't you happy
I paused at the door?

18:07.523 --> 18:09.240
I rented Kyle for the whole day.

18:09.265 --> 18:11.367
I sent Kyle home. Kyle was never here.

18:11.392 --> 18:12.428
You were never here,

18:12.453 --> 18:14.487
unless you want to start sharing
a cell with your housekeeper.

18:14.511 --> 18:15.513
On what charge?

18:15.538 --> 18:17.865
You told her you were
working with the police.

18:18.006 --> 18:20.130
Koji didn't kill anyone.

18:20.251 --> 18:22.106
You heard that thing
about the victim's wrists.

18:22.131 --> 18:23.598
He did not put up a struggle.

18:23.630 --> 18:25.058
So, unless he wanted to die,

18:25.083 --> 18:27.124
there's some whole other
game being played here.

18:28.359 --> 18:31.394
Are you having a nervous breakdown?
Is that what this is?

18:31.419 --> 18:33.474
Because I would get it, you know,
you screw up your job...

18:33.498 --> 18:35.332
I have not screwed up my job.

18:38.970 --> 18:42.619
The studio's bluffing.
Jimmy Smits? He's, like, 80.

18:54.564 --> 18:57.688
Please tell you are the guy
who murdered the other guy.

18:58.961 --> 19:00.953
- What?
- Because if you killed him,

19:00.978 --> 19:02.218
then I can get the hell out of here.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.686
- Oh, okay, back to L.A.?
- First plane.

19:04.784 --> 19:05.826
Okay, I'm that guy.

19:05.851 --> 19:07.804
I killed whoever it is
you're talking about.

19:08.671 --> 19:13.333
Junior Agent Vijay
Gill, we meet at last.

19:13.442 --> 19:14.647
Would it be weird of me to ask

19:14.672 --> 19:16.125
what the hell you're
doing in my kitchen?

19:16.149 --> 19:19.036
You've been ignoring calls
from the studio and the agency.

19:19.293 --> 19:20.891
People are concerned.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.386
I have been tasked with
bringing you back home.

19:23.514 --> 19:26.374
- I am home.
- No, your other home, your work home.

19:26.436 --> 19:28.156
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

19:28.261 --> 19:29.332
Mr. Carter, wait.

19:29.887 --> 19:32.367
Look, I know this is
going to sound extreme.

19:32.392 --> 19:35.577
But I literally can't go back
to Los Angeles without you.

19:35.744 --> 19:37.515
Just because these people
repped Tom Cruise,

19:37.540 --> 19:40.408
does not mean they
control the borders. Go home.

19:43.424 --> 19:44.792
Mr. Carter, wait.

19:45.803 --> 19:46.962
Mr. Carter!

19:47.740 --> 19:51.165
Look, Mr. Carter,
I am a Canadian citizen, okay?

19:51.190 --> 19:54.062
They won't renew my work visa
unless I get you home with me.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.401
And they will fire you.

19:55.426 --> 19:57.093
I'm on hiatus.

19:57.160 --> 19:59.461
They will fire you and sue
you for breach of contract.

20:00.347 --> 20:01.878
Nobody's firing Harley Carter.

20:01.903 --> 20:04.081
You weren't there.
They were extremely vexed.

20:04.351 --> 20:06.230
They will fire you unless you apologize.

20:07.700 --> 20:08.714
They won't.

20:09.651 --> 20:10.683
They will.

20:10.929 --> 20:12.403
- They won't.
- They will.

20:12.742 --> 20:14.376
- They won't.
- They will.

20:14.432 --> 20:15.456
- They won't.
- They will.

20:15.481 --> 20:16.722
Vijay, they won't.

20:16.747 --> 20:18.472
- Mr. Carter, they will.
- They won't.

20:18.497 --> 20:20.190
- They will.
- They won't.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.382
If I change to "They won't",
will you change to "They will"?

20:22.406 --> 20:24.479
No, because in this conversation,
I'm Bugs Bunny.

20:24.504 --> 20:25.949
And you're Daffy. I'm always Bugs.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.407
Come on. Let's go for the record.

20:27.912 --> 20:28.926
- They won't.
- They will.

20:28.951 --> 20:30.996
The record is 55 minutes.

20:31.209 --> 20:32.876
Okay, where did you come from?

20:32.901 --> 20:34.468
I was always here. I let you in.

20:34.591 --> 20:36.829
No, I distinctly remember
the lady that let me in

20:36.854 --> 20:38.025
didn't have a shotgun.

20:38.101 --> 20:39.397
What are you doing with that thing, Dot?

20:39.421 --> 20:41.055
It's a free country.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.680
A free country that frowns upon

20:42.756 --> 20:44.812
armed seniors roaming the countryside.

20:44.837 --> 20:46.438
Just don't do anything crazy.

20:46.861 --> 20:51.047
Crazy like a TV detective
investigating a non-TV murder?

20:51.173 --> 20:52.203
Hmm?

20:54.004 --> 20:56.152
Wait. There was an actual murder?

20:56.177 --> 20:57.477
I almost saw the body.

20:58.167 --> 20:59.855
Charlie Carter is involved?

21:00.140 --> 21:02.307
The police think my
housekeeper killed someone.

21:03.216 --> 21:04.614
And you're sure she didn't?

21:04.695 --> 21:07.461
No, not her, her husband, Koji.

21:07.922 --> 21:11.399
Listen, Vijay. I can't go back to L.A.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.640
Dot and Koji practically raised me.

21:15.487 --> 21:16.954
And he did not do this.

21:19.541 --> 21:21.925
I'm in a real life
Charlie Carter mystery?

21:23.552 --> 21:24.786
Nobody is leaving.

21:24.811 --> 21:26.962
Okay, we got to tail
your housekeeper now.

21:31.662 --> 21:33.951
I was about to walk straight
into crazy town, wasn't I?

21:34.071 --> 21:37.246
I'm actually headed
that way myself. You drive.

21:46.146 --> 21:47.887
I can't believe we're
tailing a murderer.

21:48.054 --> 21:49.473
She didn't kill anyone.

21:49.498 --> 21:50.821
You said it yourself.

21:50.846 --> 21:53.102
Koji told Childress to
stay away from his family.

21:53.327 --> 21:54.961
Even if she didn't pull the trigger,

21:55.136 --> 21:56.571
she's neck-deep in this now.

21:57.713 --> 21:59.758
Whoa, whoa, whoa, she pulled over.
She pulled over.

21:59.783 --> 22:01.041
What do I do? What do I do?

22:01.066 --> 22:02.467
Right, there's a space
across the street. Just...

22:02.491 --> 22:03.497
Yeah.

22:04.138 --> 22:05.210
Okay, okay.

22:05.380 --> 22:07.261
Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch out.
What are you doing?

22:07.523 --> 22:09.491
Wow, could you be any more conspicuous?

22:09.516 --> 22:10.975
- Oh, God.
- I mean, is there a button

22:10.999 --> 22:12.419
that will shoot flames
out of this thing?

22:12.443 --> 22:13.458
I'm nervous!

22:13.483 --> 22:14.640
Yeah, well, you shouldn't be

22:14.665 --> 22:16.718
'cause you're doing as
terrible a job as you could.

22:16.993 --> 22:18.493
Sorry! Sorry, everyone.

22:19.035 --> 22:20.327
Almost got it, one more.

22:20.420 --> 22:21.444
Sorry.

22:21.523 --> 22:22.702
Go, go, go, in, in, in.

22:23.063 --> 22:25.303
Wow, that was awful.

22:26.846 --> 22:27.931
Do you think she saw us?

22:27.956 --> 22:30.625
No, she can't see very well.
That's why she uses the shotgun.

22:31.603 --> 22:32.691
Who's she with?

22:36.386 --> 22:39.231
Whoa, the daughter of the dead guy.

22:39.765 --> 22:41.027
Awesome!

22:41.336 --> 22:43.471
Okay, what is she doing
with the daughter of a man

22:43.496 --> 22:44.831
her husband supposedly killed?

22:47.531 --> 22:48.573
I got nothing.

22:48.795 --> 22:51.452
Maybe she paid your gun-toting
housekeeper to kill her dad.

22:51.539 --> 22:52.569
That's your theory?

22:52.594 --> 22:54.647
That my housekeepers are
secretly contract killers?

22:55.116 --> 22:56.374
What's your theory then?

22:56.399 --> 22:58.567
My theory is that your theory is stupid.

22:58.908 --> 23:00.948
Well, on the show,
you usually have a theory by now.

23:00.992 --> 23:02.393
So, who's stupid?

23:02.418 --> 23:04.439
Yeah, well, on the show,
I also have my own trailer

23:04.464 --> 23:07.579
and a woman who's only job is to
make me spicy tuna sandwiches.

23:12.458 --> 23:14.378
Now we're just watching
two people drink coffee.

23:15.773 --> 23:17.293
You can't read lips, can you?

23:20.615 --> 23:21.882
Vijay!

23:24.642 --> 23:30.411
She shovels the running zipper.

23:31.481 --> 23:33.960
Bobo, booboo.

23:34.089 --> 23:35.405
You could have just said "No".

23:36.096 --> 23:39.050
I wish we could just do what you
do on the show when you get stuck.

23:39.075 --> 23:40.143
What's that?

23:40.168 --> 23:42.417
You call up your street-wise
pal Davy Leach.

23:42.442 --> 23:44.097
And he points you in
the right direction.

23:44.365 --> 23:47.151
Of course, Leach always has his
own agenda. So, there's that.

23:48.112 --> 23:49.651
Vijay, phone.

23:51.307 --> 23:52.472
Who are you calling?

23:53.406 --> 23:56.742
Dave Leigh, coffee truck impresario,

23:56.767 --> 23:59.970
hey, man, have I told you
how much I love the truck?

24:00.105 --> 24:02.740
Four times.
So far, it's the only point you've made.

24:03.306 --> 24:06.341
Yeah, this is, uhh,
this is super awkward.

24:06.610 --> 24:07.911
I guess we really haven't talked

24:07.936 --> 24:09.946
since my writers came up
with that new character.

24:10.528 --> 24:12.898
Yeah, your junky, street-wise sidekick?

24:13.068 --> 24:14.793
Yeah, not based on you, you know?

24:14.818 --> 24:18.078
You're not a junky, anymore,
not that you ever were.

24:18.455 --> 24:20.536
You called him "Davy Leach".

24:20.870 --> 24:23.528
Yeah, that was, uhh... That was our bad.

24:23.553 --> 24:27.005
Davy Leach, Dave Leigh,
that's... That's super close.

24:27.030 --> 24:30.088
But by the same token, you know,
Charlie Carter, Harley Carter,

24:30.113 --> 24:31.739
people are always confusing the two.

24:32.381 --> 24:34.017
By "People", do you mean you?

24:34.042 --> 24:35.531
'Cause that's the word on the street,

24:35.556 --> 24:38.476
that you're running around,
playing detective.

24:39.543 --> 24:41.202
You and Sam do keep in touch.

24:41.835 --> 24:43.327
What do you want, Harley?

24:43.352 --> 24:44.442
Hey, what do you know about

24:44.467 --> 24:47.286
this whole Albert
Childress murder thingy?

24:49.129 --> 24:50.893
Koji didn't kill Albert Childress.

24:51.025 --> 24:53.347
Well, obviously. So, who did?

24:57.352 --> 24:58.495
Just give it to me.

24:58.520 --> 25:02.283
You know what, the last time
I helped you, I lost a toe.

25:02.330 --> 25:04.324
And I lost my favourite hat, okay?

25:04.349 --> 25:05.964
Nut up. It was Grade Eleven.

25:06.949 --> 25:08.955
All right, I want $20,000.

25:09.506 --> 25:10.517
What?

25:10.542 --> 25:14.642
For Davy Leach,
four years of Davy Leach, 20 grand.

25:15.478 --> 25:16.628
Deal.

25:19.686 --> 25:22.655
All right. Where's Dot?

25:22.986 --> 25:26.288
Funny you should ask.
I got someone tailing her as we speak.

25:26.323 --> 25:27.367
Let me see your phone.

25:27.900 --> 25:29.078
Where's your phone?

25:34.321 --> 25:35.950
Hey, it's Harley. What's going on?

25:37.083 --> 25:39.114
Seriously? Are you kidding?

25:39.948 --> 25:40.984
You're fired.

25:41.848 --> 25:44.063
No, you're not really fired.
I'll talk to you later.

25:45.508 --> 25:46.997
All right, my agent lost her.

25:47.168 --> 25:50.067
In his defence, he's an agent.
And she shot out his tires.

25:50.489 --> 25:53.027
Yeah, that sounds like Dot.
Did you talk to Tetsu?

25:53.474 --> 25:54.996
What is a Tetsu?

25:55.250 --> 25:57.503
Tetsu, Koji and Dot's nephew

25:57.528 --> 25:59.901
who's been living at your
house for the last few months.

25:59.926 --> 26:00.926
You didn't know.

26:01.148 --> 26:02.515
I did not know that.

26:02.540 --> 26:06.785
But I suspect I'm wearing his
sneakers, not his underwear.

26:09.305 --> 26:10.378
I got to go.

26:10.403 --> 26:11.844
You know what, I'm coming with you.

26:11.869 --> 26:13.837
Hey, man, I really appreciate your help.

26:13.862 --> 26:17.165
And unlike Davy Leach,
you do not have an ulterior motive.

26:17.424 --> 26:19.025
I want my 20 grand.

26:33.218 --> 26:34.852
Told you he'd suck you in.

26:34.877 --> 26:37.267
Yeah, but I'm getting 20 grand. You?

26:37.752 --> 26:39.537
All right, enough with
the chitty-chatty.

26:39.719 --> 26:41.381
Did you know that Koji had a nephew,

26:41.406 --> 26:43.639
- who has been living at my house?
- I didn't.

26:44.350 --> 26:46.862
I think the nephew might be
mixed up in all this somehow.

26:47.112 --> 26:49.690
Well, I did some checking
into Koji's story.

26:50.267 --> 26:51.276
And?

26:51.301 --> 26:53.899
And his bowling league said
he bowled a 280 on that night.

26:53.924 --> 26:56.017
So, he has an alibi,
whether he wants one or not.

26:56.626 --> 26:58.577
So, I brought a peace offering.

26:59.066 --> 27:02.499
Oh, if it wasn't for all the
weird tension between us,

27:02.652 --> 27:05.322
I'd say this is starting
to feel like the old days.

27:06.104 --> 27:07.783
The old days had a lot of weird tension.

27:11.264 --> 27:12.296
All right, stay here.

27:12.321 --> 27:14.131
Hey, hey, do you have a
permit for that piece?

27:14.156 --> 27:16.509
Do you really want to be having
this conversation right now?

27:16.533 --> 27:18.500
- Yes, I do.
- All right, go left.

27:18.535 --> 27:19.967
Stay, please.

27:37.903 --> 27:40.279
Hey, we need to talk.

27:47.777 --> 27:49.820
You want to tell me what
you were doing in my house?

27:51.151 --> 27:52.589
I think someone's after me.

27:52.969 --> 27:54.808
Tetsu and his aunt are protecting me.

27:55.523 --> 27:58.497
Who? Do you know who killed your dad?

27:59.142 --> 28:00.413
Did you see someone?

28:00.977 --> 28:02.552
No, I don't remember.

28:04.626 --> 28:09.297
I walked in the room.
There was just so much blood.

28:10.224 --> 28:12.864
Okay, it's okay. You're safe now.

28:16.231 --> 28:17.278
Just stay here.

28:18.208 --> 28:19.474
Get in the car.

28:23.768 --> 28:25.401
What the hell is going on?

28:25.426 --> 28:27.060
That was a warning shot.

28:27.085 --> 28:28.698
We just want to talk to him.

28:28.706 --> 28:31.050
Tetsu is here.
But Dot won't let Sam anywhere near him.

28:31.075 --> 28:32.669
Well, Abigail's here too.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.029
- Where?
- Out back.

28:34.536 --> 28:35.770
Not anymore, she isn't.

28:37.786 --> 28:38.848
Damn it.

28:39.490 --> 28:42.122
This is your fault.
I was just trying to keep him safe.

28:42.207 --> 28:43.220
From who?

28:43.245 --> 28:45.554
There's someone out there.
I didn't get a good look.

28:45.579 --> 28:47.039
I took a shot to scare them off.

28:47.064 --> 28:48.764
But here you come to mess things up.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.663
Abigail and Tetsu are friends.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.920
"Friends" make them sound
like they're eight.

28:54.404 --> 28:55.464
The lawn jockey.

28:55.498 --> 28:56.546
The what?

28:56.571 --> 28:59.507
Would Albert Childress have been
considered a tolerant fellow?

28:59.587 --> 29:01.776
No, racist dickhead and proud of it.

29:02.167 --> 29:04.649
Okay, Childress finds out that
Tetsu is dating his daughter

29:04.674 --> 29:06.190
and, what, threatens the kid?

29:06.543 --> 29:08.082
"Stay away from my family."

29:08.344 --> 29:10.215
That's what Koji was overheard saying.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.535
He was talking about his nephew.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.910
It doesn't mean that the
nephew didn't kill the old man.

29:14.017 --> 29:15.760
He takes the old man out of the picture.

29:15.785 --> 29:17.408
And then he runs away with his daughter.

29:17.554 --> 29:21.182
Tetsu didn't hurt anyone.
He was here with me all night.

29:22.041 --> 29:25.826
All right, Tetsu did not kill Childress.
Who the hell did?

29:25.857 --> 29:27.607
Probably whoever Dot just scared off.

29:27.632 --> 29:28.904
Who's still out there, right?

29:29.204 --> 29:30.220
Those kids are in danger.

29:30.245 --> 29:31.806
- All right, let's go.
- I'm coming too.

29:31.831 --> 29:34.142
- The more eyes, the better.
- On one condition.

29:35.088 --> 29:36.330
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

29:36.380 --> 29:39.955
I... I have a permit for this.
It's just not on me.

29:40.690 --> 29:44.292
As for you, you lock it up
until the police get here.

29:52.162 --> 29:54.392
Brenda, we have a situation
over at Harley's house.

29:54.669 --> 29:55.751
Send a couple of cars.

30:09.253 --> 30:10.565
What do you guys think?

30:10.603 --> 30:13.581
I remember this place.
It's the first place I got drunk.

30:13.605 --> 30:14.651
- Me too.
- Me too.

30:18.519 --> 30:20.009
They're inside.

30:22.552 --> 30:23.911
All right, be careful.

30:49.675 --> 30:52.906
Police, freeze now! Don't move!

30:54.639 --> 30:56.461
The star-crossed lovers.

30:57.695 --> 30:58.797
Tetsu.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.449
You're not in this country
legally, are you?

31:03.049 --> 31:05.684
That's why Dot and Koji have
been keeping you off the radar.

31:05.709 --> 31:07.143
He didn't kill my dad.

31:07.763 --> 31:09.432
Sam, can I talk to you for a second?

31:10.269 --> 31:11.582
What are we going to do?

31:11.612 --> 31:13.713
Come on, look at the guy.
It's not Tetsu.

31:14.856 --> 31:16.026
Why do you think that?

31:16.051 --> 31:17.986
It's always someone we met earlier,

31:18.011 --> 31:19.752
someone who we thought
was totally innocent.

31:19.777 --> 31:21.314
And then, in a shocking twist,

31:21.339 --> 31:23.607
it's revealed that they're
the one who actually did it.

31:23.632 --> 31:26.802
Harley, you do realize that life
is not like a TV show, right?

31:27.763 --> 31:30.168
A police investigation
doesn't just wrap up in a bow

31:30.380 --> 31:31.403
in the third act.

31:31.439 --> 31:33.817
Actually, it would be the fifth act.

31:34.186 --> 31:37.154
One-hour crime dramas typically
follow a five-act structure,

31:37.179 --> 31:39.564
which I can see doesn't
interest you in the slightest.

31:40.294 --> 31:41.330
Guys?

31:44.505 --> 31:45.640
We have a problem.

31:46.192 --> 31:48.024
I've never seen this guy before.

31:49.668 --> 31:50.963
So much for your theory.

31:52.237 --> 31:53.533
All right, take it easy.

31:58.546 --> 32:00.121
Drop the weapon. Or I'll kill him.

32:00.488 --> 32:02.112
No one needs to get hurt.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.930
Mark? What are you doing?

32:15.353 --> 32:16.555
Wait. You know this guy?

32:18.424 --> 32:19.598
Ex-boyfriend?

32:22.674 --> 32:24.742
The whiter shade of pale
the dad liked better.

32:29.666 --> 32:30.886
Did you kill my dad?

32:31.555 --> 32:32.925
That wasn't the plan.

32:34.843 --> 32:36.258
Childress didn't put up a struggle.

32:36.283 --> 32:38.718
So, either he wanted to die
or he wasn't expecting it.

32:38.978 --> 32:41.113
You and Childress were
in on this together.

32:42.193 --> 32:44.886
What? What are you saying?

32:45.016 --> 32:47.128
The old man did not like me much.

32:47.178 --> 32:49.655
But when he caught wind
of her new boyfriend,

32:50.327 --> 32:53.007
he came to me with a plan to
get him out of the picture.

32:53.564 --> 32:56.366
So, you faked a robbery,
trying to frame Tetsu.

32:56.807 --> 32:58.077
Why kill Childress?

32:58.102 --> 33:00.077
- She came home early!
- Daddy?

33:00.328 --> 33:02.206
It felt like the plan
was just falling apart.

33:02.608 --> 33:04.925
And I knew your dad was going
to throw me under the bus.

33:04.950 --> 33:07.472
So, I... Look, I just panicked.

33:11.651 --> 33:13.741
A man died because you panicked.

33:13.766 --> 33:15.171
No one liked him anyway.

33:15.196 --> 33:18.164
And it worked, even stealing
that gun from your house.

33:18.454 --> 33:20.214
Those people have a lot
of guns lying around.

33:20.289 --> 33:21.538
They do have a lot of guns.

33:22.154 --> 33:24.522
Abi, we're leaving.

33:24.656 --> 33:26.525
No, please no.

33:26.669 --> 33:27.744
You're my insurance.

33:30.579 --> 33:31.921
Whoa, whoa, no, no,

33:31.946 --> 33:34.710
we're good. We're good.
My bad, that was dumb. That was dumb.

33:37.366 --> 33:38.403
Come on!

33:43.847 --> 33:45.348
You won't get very far.

33:45.444 --> 33:47.675
These woods are crawling
with cops by now.

33:47.726 --> 33:48.875
Is that what you think?

33:50.740 --> 33:51.828
Don't move.

33:52.097 --> 33:54.432
I just wanted to apologize
for my buddy gunning you.

33:54.457 --> 33:55.854
I said stop.

33:55.879 --> 34:00.459
I'm here to say sorry on behalf
of Dave for gunning it earlier.

34:00.484 --> 34:01.498
Don't move!

34:01.523 --> 34:04.862
He should not have gunned it like that.
That was very bad.

34:04.887 --> 34:07.155
I will shoot right now, in the face!

34:07.180 --> 34:08.197
Sam!

34:10.362 --> 34:12.498
I'm so glad you guys
picked up on my code!

34:12.661 --> 34:14.897
I had to shoot him before
he picked up on it.

34:15.422 --> 34:17.322
You're going to be sorry you did that.

34:17.382 --> 34:20.607
You know, there are better distractions
than getting shot in the face.

34:20.679 --> 34:22.065
I went with a classic!

34:22.091 --> 34:23.324
What if I had missed?

34:23.784 --> 34:26.484
Missing is not your thing.

34:35.234 --> 34:36.474
What the hell took you so long?

34:37.134 --> 34:38.649
Looks like I missed the fun.

34:39.554 --> 34:40.846
I'll take him down to the station,

34:40.870 --> 34:43.355
get started on the paperwork. Come on.

34:44.177 --> 34:45.476
Where are the rest of the cops?

34:45.502 --> 34:46.675
They're en route.

34:46.699 --> 34:48.440
It's just that Mark
said something earlier,

34:48.465 --> 34:50.215
suggesting that no other
cops would be showing up.

34:50.239 --> 34:52.072
Well, he was wrong. Here I am.

34:52.297 --> 34:53.899
What are you getting at, Harl?

34:53.924 --> 34:55.891
Why don't we continue this conversation

34:55.917 --> 34:56.954
back at the station?

34:56.978 --> 34:58.973
How about we just wait
for backup to arrive?

34:59.737 --> 35:01.063
This is ridiculous.

35:01.466 --> 35:03.645
We've already got
the ex-boyfriend. Let's just go.

35:03.891 --> 35:05.333
How would you know that?

35:06.955 --> 35:09.094
How would you know that
he was the ex-boyfriend?

35:10.858 --> 35:12.048
Drop the gun, Sam.

35:13.486 --> 35:15.616
Dirty cop, staple of the genre.

35:17.570 --> 35:18.750
What is this about, Brenda?

35:18.823 --> 35:20.852
She's got two more.

35:24.808 --> 35:27.457
I'm just cleaning up another one
of my little brother's messes.

35:27.796 --> 35:29.163
He's your brother?

35:29.188 --> 35:30.960
How did you not know that
that was her brother?

35:30.984 --> 35:32.784
We're partners, not friends.

35:33.081 --> 35:34.693
All you had to do was
let us drive out of here.

35:34.717 --> 35:37.504
We would have disappeared.
But now we have a problem.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.203
You guys were home free.

35:39.228 --> 35:41.129
The cops were looking
for Tetsu, not Mark.

35:41.416 --> 35:44.184
So, why would you come after
these two, guns blazing?

35:44.209 --> 35:46.220
Because Abigail witnessed the murder.

35:47.005 --> 35:48.533
She says now that she
didn't see anything.

35:48.557 --> 35:49.838
But that's just the shock talking.

35:49.862 --> 35:52.275
Traumatic events can effect
the encoding of memories.

35:52.300 --> 35:55.322
It's called "Psychogenic amnesia".
And it's temporary.

35:55.963 --> 35:57.471
Still got that freaky memory, huh?

35:57.496 --> 35:59.986
Looks like mister TV detective
isn't just a pretty face.

36:00.838 --> 36:02.402
Let's see if we can do
something about that.

36:02.426 --> 36:05.182
The memory stuff was all true.
But mostly, I was just stalling.

36:05.207 --> 36:07.206
Freeze, dirt bag.

36:13.324 --> 36:14.332
You're welcome.

36:15.779 --> 36:16.845
Twist ending,

36:17.957 --> 36:18.962
called it.

36:29.545 --> 36:31.471
Ah, Dot, we could have gotten those.

36:31.496 --> 36:32.543
You still can.

36:32.568 --> 36:35.197
No, no, no, thank you.
I am not ungrateful, like this guy.

36:35.222 --> 36:36.238
Thank you.

36:36.373 --> 36:37.925
I'm glad you're free, Koji.

36:37.950 --> 36:39.441
And I hope it wasn't too horrible.

36:39.566 --> 36:40.807
The only thing horrible

36:40.855 --> 36:43.308
was Koji's mad dog killer performance.

36:43.359 --> 36:45.722
The police did not believe
me to be convincing either.

36:45.956 --> 36:47.762
He is a worse actor than you.

36:47.796 --> 36:50.692
Weird time to take a shot
at my acting, but whatevs.

36:51.035 --> 36:52.114
And this.

36:55.435 --> 36:58.489
Oh, oh, oh, check it out!

36:58.877 --> 37:00.544
"Be the Hero".

37:01.118 --> 37:03.287
Yeah, I may have mentioned to the mayor

37:03.312 --> 37:05.143
that thing that my mom used to tell me.

37:05.366 --> 37:06.424
Used to tell us.

37:06.982 --> 37:09.217
"If your life is a story, be the hero."

37:10.382 --> 37:12.304
- Uh-oh.
- What?

37:13.234 --> 37:17.562
"Therefore, Mayor Hamilton
is offering Harley Carter

37:17.587 --> 37:20.962
the position of consulting detective

37:20.996 --> 37:22.808
to the Bishop Police Department."

37:22.840 --> 37:23.905
- What?
- What?

37:24.325 --> 37:26.234
This is the first I'm hearing of this.

37:26.268 --> 37:27.913
I mean, you can't accept it.

37:28.108 --> 37:31.725
Of course I can't. Wait. Why can't I?

37:31.750 --> 37:35.386
How about because it's insane?
And Vijay would kill you.

37:35.944 --> 37:36.975
Oh.

37:37.246 --> 37:38.366
What?

37:38.391 --> 37:41.553
Nothing, they're just retelling
your whole life story,

37:41.578 --> 37:43.045
starting when we were kids.

37:43.519 --> 37:44.542
Our first case.

37:46.355 --> 37:48.925
I don't know where they
dig up all this old stuff.

37:49.558 --> 37:51.105
That's ancient history.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.508
Hey, do you guys want to
hear something weird?

37:59.070 --> 38:01.413
Is it about you two sleeping
together at a Christmas party?

38:05.441 --> 38:06.474
We didn't.

38:07.443 --> 38:10.411
You just peed in my closet and
fell asleep in my mom's bed.

38:10.446 --> 38:14.373
You are so mean! You are so mean!

38:14.398 --> 38:15.467
I'm the meanest.

38:16.849 --> 38:17.941
You were saying.

38:20.285 --> 38:23.285
These last few days, you know,

38:23.310 --> 38:26.942
despite all the punching,
kicking and shooting.

38:28.905 --> 38:30.065
I had so much fun.

38:30.768 --> 38:32.596
Now that's the Harley Carter I remember.

38:32.963 --> 38:34.221
But seriously though,

38:34.736 --> 38:37.472
you're not thinking of
accepting her offer, right?

38:37.506 --> 38:39.908
"Consulting detective"? Come on.

38:40.110 --> 38:41.658
I only play one on TV.

38:43.073 --> 38:44.073
Okay.

38:46.166 --> 38:47.561
So, you going to stick around?

38:47.850 --> 38:49.250
I'm on hiatus.

38:49.557 --> 38:50.962
I'm going to stick around like crazy,

38:50.986 --> 38:52.787
maybe get into a little trouble.

38:52.821 --> 38:56.344
Oh, goodie. I'll get the VIP
jail cell all ready for you.

38:57.515 --> 38:59.743
To the best hiatus ever.

38:59.783 --> 39:01.415
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

39:04.466 --> 39:06.901
You guys remember Robbie
MacDougall from high school?

39:06.935 --> 39:08.099
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:08.124 --> 39:09.567
Well, his grandma called me.

39:09.592 --> 39:12.154
She has not seen her
teeth since Tuesday.

39:14.505 --> 39:16.668
Guys, I have a few leads.
