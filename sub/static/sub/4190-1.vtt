02:06.894 --> 02:08.883
Why, hello there,
Mr. Neff.

02:21.171 --> 02:25.334
Working pretty late, aren't you,
Mr. Neff? Late enough. Let's ride.

02:28.644 --> 02:31.578
You look kind of all
in, at that. I'm fine.

02:32.013 --> 02:35.106
How is the insurance
business, Mr. Neff? Okay.

02:35.983 --> 02:37.779
They wouldn't ever
sell me any.

02:37.851 --> 02:39.579
They said I have something
loose in my heart.

02:39.652 --> 02:40.777
[Chuckles]

02:40.853 --> 02:43.150
I say it's rheumatism.
Yeah?

Office memorandum.

04:43.782 --> 04:46.682
Walter Neff to Barton Keyes,
Claims Manager.

04:47.986 --> 04:50.180
Los Angeles, July 16, 1938.

04:52.155 --> 04:53.621
Dear Keyes...

04:55.224 --> 04:58.215
I suppose you'll call this
a confession when you hear it.

04:58.294 --> 05:00.659
Well, I don't like
the word confession.

05:00.729 --> 05:02.855
I just want to set you right
about something you couldn't see...

05:02.931 --> 05:04.625
because it was smack up
against your nose.

05:05.799 --> 05:07.891
You think you're such a hot
potato as a Claims Manager...

05:07.968 --> 05:10.162
such a wolf on a phony claim.

05:11.271 --> 05:15.172
Maybe you are, but let's take a
look at that Dietrichson claim.

05:16.341 --> 05:18.570
Accident and double indemnity.

05:19.443 --> 05:22.605
You were pretty good in there
for a while, Keyes.

05:22.879 --> 05:25.506
You said it wasn't
an accident. Check.

05:25.915 --> 05:28.348
You said it wasn't suicide.
Check.

05:29.184 --> 05:32.346
You said it was murder. Check.

05:34.489 --> 05:37.013
You thought you had it cold,
didn't you?

05:37.090 --> 05:40.286
All wrapped up in tissue paper,
with pink ribbons around it.

05:40.360 --> 05:41.883
It was perfect.

05:42.495 --> 05:45.486
Except it wasn't, because
you made one mistake...

05:45.563 --> 05:47.462
just one little mistake.

05:48.700 --> 05:52.499
When it came to picking the
killer, you picked the wrong guy.

05:53.437 --> 05:56.166
You want to know who
killed Dietrichson?

05:56.806 --> 05:59.865
Hold tight to that
cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.

06:01.310 --> 06:02.867
I killed Dietrichson.

06:02.944 --> 06:05.810
Me, Walter Neff,
insurance salesman.

06:06.080 --> 06:09.014
35 years old, unmarried,
no visible scars...

06:11.184 --> 06:13.276
until a while ago, that is.

06:14.753 --> 06:16.413
Yes, I killed him.

06:18.122 --> 06:20.146
I killed him for money...

06:20.224 --> 06:21.815
and for a woman.

06:23.627 --> 06:27.790
And I didn't get the money
and I didn't get the woman.

06:29.999 --> 06:31.625
Pretty, isn't it?

06:33.101 --> 06:35.034
[Buzzing]

06:41.908 --> 06:42.896
[Buzzing stops]

06:45.477 --> 06:47.341
It all began last May.

06:48.613 --> 06:49.806
Around the end of May, it was.

06:51.982 --> 06:56.111
<i>I'd been out to Glendale to deliver
a policy on some dairy trucks.</i>

06:56.186 --> 06:59.677
<i>On the way back I remembered this
auto renewal near Los Feliz Boulevard.</i>

06:59.788 --> 07:01.687
<i>So I drove over there.</i>

07:01.957 --> 07:03.719
<i>It was one of those
California Spanish houses...</i>

07:03.791 --> 07:06.691
<i>everyone was nuts about
10 or 15 years ago.</i>

07:07.260 --> 07:10.194
<i>This one must've cost somebody
about $30,000.</i>

07:10.464 --> 07:12.727
<i>That is, if he ever
finished paying for it.</i>

07:12.798 --> 07:14.424
[Doorbell ringing]

07:15.634 --> 07:17.100
Is Mr. Dietrichson in?

07:17.168 --> 07:19.692
Who wants to see him? My
name is Neff. Walter Neff.

07:19.771 --> 07:23.001
If you're selling something... Look,
it's Mr. Dietrichson I want to talk to...

07:23.073 --> 07:24.232
and it's not
magazine subscriptions.

07:24.308 --> 07:26.707
Listen, Mr. Dietrichson is not
in. How soon do you expect him?

07:26.776 --> 07:28.970
He'll be home when he gets
here, if that's any help to you.

07:29.045 --> 07:30.773
(Phyllis)
What is it, Nettie? Who is it?

07:30.846 --> 07:32.642
It's for Mr. Dietrichson.

07:32.714 --> 07:34.806
I'm Mrs. Dietrichson.
What is it?

07:35.483 --> 07:36.949
How do you do,
Mrs. Dietrichson?

07:37.017 --> 07:38.950
I'm Walter Neff,
Pacific All Risk.

07:39.018 --> 07:42.180
Pacific all what? The Pacific
All Risk Insurance Company.

07:42.255 --> 07:44.245
It's about some renewals
on the automobiles.

07:44.323 --> 07:46.882
I've been trying to contact your
husband for the past two weeks...

07:46.959 --> 07:50.121
but he's never in his office.
Is there anything I can do?

07:50.194 --> 07:51.683
The insurance ran out
on the 15th.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.889
I'd hate to think of your
having a smashed fender...

07:53.964 --> 07:55.590
or something
while you're not...

07:55.665 --> 07:56.926
fully covered.

07:58.134 --> 08:00.397
Perhaps I know
what you mean, Mr. Neff.

08:00.469 --> 08:04.302
I've just been taking a sunbath.
No pigeons around, I hope.

08:05.306 --> 08:08.433
About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I hate to take up your time, but...

08:08.509 --> 08:09.839
Oh, that's all right.

08:09.910 --> 08:12.400
If you'll wait till I put
something on, I'll be right down.

08:12.478 --> 08:15.378
Nettie, show Mr. Neff
into the living room.

08:18.049 --> 08:19.379
Where would
the living room be?

08:19.451 --> 08:21.884
In there, but they keep
the liquor locked up.

08:21.952 --> 08:24.943
It's all right.
I always carry my own keys.

08:32.327 --> 08:33.986
<i>(Walter) The living
room was still stuffy...</i>

08:34.061 --> 08:35.721
<i>from last night's cigars.</i>

08:36.597 --> 08:37.756
<i>The windows were closed...</i>

08:37.832 --> 08:39.856
<i>and the sunshine coming in
through the venetian blinds...</i>

08:39.933 --> 08:42.162
<i>showed up the dust in the air.</i>

08:43.501 --> 08:47.130
<i>On the piano, in a couple of fancy
frames, were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola...</i>

08:47.205 --> 08:49.434
<i>his daughter
by his first wife.</i>

08:50.708 --> 08:52.937
<i>They had a bowl of those
little red goldfish...</i>

08:53.010 --> 08:55.409
<i>on the table behind
the big davenport.</i>

08:55.612 --> 08:56.839
<i>But to tell you
the truth, Keyes...</i>

08:56.913 --> 08:59.938
<i>I wasn't a whole lot interested
in goldfish right then.</i>

09:00.016 --> 09:03.974
<i>Or in auto renewals, or in Mr.
Dietrichson and his daughter Lola.</i>

09:04.052 --> 09:07.953
<i>I was thinking about that dame upstairs,
and the way she had looked at me...</i>

09:08.022 --> 09:10.717
<i>and I wanted
to see her again, close...</i>

09:10.790 --> 09:13.519
<i>without that silly staircase
between us.</i>

09:18.764 --> 09:21.231
I wasn't long, was I? (Walter)
Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

09:21.299 --> 09:24.790
Hope I've got my face on straight.
It's perfect, for my money.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.300
Neff is the name, isn't it?
Yeah.

09:26.369 --> 09:28.666
With two "F's," like in
Philadelphia, if you know the story.

09:28.737 --> 09:31.296
<i>What story?
The Philadelphia Story.</i>

09:31.540 --> 09:33.530
Suppose we sit down and you
tell me about the insurance.

09:33.608 --> 09:36.098
My husband never
tells me anything.

09:36.177 --> 09:39.543
Well, it's on your two cars,
the LaSalle and the Plymouth.

09:41.014 --> 09:44.005
We've been handling this insurance
for Mr. Dietrichson for three years...

09:44.083 --> 09:46.607
and we'd hate to see
the policies lapse.

09:47.018 --> 09:50.817
That's a honey of an anklet
you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

09:51.021 --> 09:53.545
As I was saying, we'd hate
to see the policies lapse.

09:53.624 --> 09:56.421
Of course, we give them 30 days.
That's all we're allowed to give.

09:56.493 --> 09:58.983
I guess he's been too busy down
at Long Beach in the oil fields.

09:59.062 --> 10:01.256
Couldn't I catch him at home
some evening for a few minutes?

10:01.330 --> 10:03.263
I suppose so. But he's
never home much before 8:00.

10:03.332 --> 10:04.662
That's fine with me.

10:04.732 --> 10:06.756
You're not connected with
the Automobile Club, are you?

10:06.834 --> 10:09.233
No, the All Risk,
Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?

10:09.302 --> 10:12.270
Somebody from the Automobile
Club has been trying to get him.

10:12.339 --> 10:15.171
Do they have a better rate?
If your husband's a member.

10:15.241 --> 10:16.298
No, he isn't.

10:16.375 --> 10:19.537
Well, then he'd have to join the club
and pay the membership fee to start with.

10:19.611 --> 10:22.306
I never knock the other fellow's
merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.

10:22.380 --> 10:26.338
The Automobile Club's fine. I can
do just as well for you, though.

10:26.416 --> 10:28.610
I have a very attractive
policy here.

10:28.684 --> 10:31.345
It wouldn't take me two minutes
to put it in front of your husband.

10:31.420 --> 10:33.979
For instance, we're writing a new
kind of 50% retention feature...

10:34.055 --> 10:36.079
in the collision coverage.

10:36.624 --> 10:39.057
You're a smart insurance man,
aren't you, Mr. Neff?

10:39.126 --> 10:41.685
Well, I've been at it 11
years. Doing pretty well?

10:41.761 --> 10:43.125
It's a living.

10:43.863 --> 10:47.423
You handle just automobile
insurance, or all kinds?

10:47.499 --> 10:50.934
All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft,
public liability, group insurance...

10:51.002 --> 10:53.435
industrial stuff and so on,
right down the line.

10:53.571 --> 10:54.832
Accident insurance?

10:54.905 --> 10:57.134
Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.228
[Chuckles]

10:59.074 --> 11:02.270
Wish you'd tell me what's
engraved on that anklet.

11:02.711 --> 11:05.235
Just my name.
As, for instance?

11:06.814 --> 11:08.542
Phyllis.
Phyllis, huh?

11:09.216 --> 11:12.013
I think I like that.
But you're not sure?

11:12.085 --> 11:15.247
I'd have to drive it around
the block a couple of times.

11:15.321 --> 11:18.050
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop
by tomorrow evening around 8:30?

11:18.123 --> 11:19.987
He'll be in then.
Who?

11:20.058 --> 11:23.288
My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?

11:23.360 --> 11:26.260
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of
getting over the idea...

11:26.329 --> 11:27.693
if you know what I mean.

11:27.764 --> 11:31.199
There's a speed limit in this
state, Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.

11:31.266 --> 11:34.530
How fast was I going, officer?
I'd say around 90.

11:34.836 --> 11:37.235
Suppose you get down off your
motorcycle and give me a ticket.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.534
Suppose I let you off
with a warning this time.

11:39.607 --> 11:41.335
Suppose it doesn't take.

11:41.408 --> 11:43.773
Suppose I have to whack you
over the knuckles.

11:43.843 --> 11:46.743
Suppose I bust out crying and
put my head on your shoulder.

11:46.812 --> 11:49.939
Suppose you try putting it
on my husband's shoulder.

11:50.014 --> 11:51.503
That tears it.

11:55.819 --> 11:59.185
8:30 tomorrow evening then.
That's what I suggested.

11:59.255 --> 12:01.916
Will you be here, too?
I guess so, I usually am.

12:02.024 --> 12:04.321
Same chair, same perfume,
same anklet?

12:04.392 --> 12:06.416
I wonder if I know
what you mean.

12:07.428 --> 12:09.327
I wonder if you wonder.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.398
<i>(Walter) It was a hot afternoon
and I can still remember...</i>

12:15.468 --> 12:18.402
<i>the smell of honeysuckle
all along that street.</i>

12:18.470 --> 12:22.701
<i>How could I have known that murder
can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?</i>

12:22.773 --> 12:23.966
<i>Maybe you would
have known, Keyes...</i>

12:24.041 --> 12:27.669
<i>the minute she mentioned
accident insurance, but I didn't.</i>

12:27.744 --> 12:29.608
<i>I felt like a million.</i>

12:30.312 --> 12:33.576
<i>I went back to the office
to see if I had any mail.</i>

12:33.816 --> 12:36.943
<i>It was the day you had that truck
driver from Inglewood on the carpet.</i>

12:37.018 --> 12:38.314
<i>Remember, Keyes?</i>

12:38.386 --> 12:40.785
Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes
wants to see you.

12:40.854 --> 12:42.753
He's been yelling for you
all afternoon.

12:42.823 --> 12:44.790
Is he sore, or just frothing
at the mouth a little?

12:44.857 --> 12:46.881
Park this for me,
will you, sweetheart?

12:51.529 --> 12:53.393
Hello, Walter.
Hi, George.

12:55.499 --> 12:56.624
Come on. Come on, Garlopis.

12:56.700 --> 12:58.564
You're not kidding anybody
with that line of bull.

12:58.635 --> 13:00.693
You're in a jam and
you know it. Says you.

13:00.770 --> 13:02.999
All I want is my money. Says you.

13:03.071 --> 13:05.698
All you're gonna get
is the cops. Hello, Walter.

13:05.841 --> 13:08.934
This is Sam Garlopis from
Inglewood. Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.

13:09.010 --> 13:11.944
Wrote a policy on his truck.
How are you, Mr. Garlopis?

13:12.012 --> 13:16.277
I ain't so good. My truck burned
down. Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.

13:17.049 --> 13:19.516
Every month hundreds of claims
come to this desk.

13:19.585 --> 13:21.882
Some of them are phonies,
and I know which ones.

13:21.953 --> 13:24.944
How do I know? Because
my little man tells me.

13:26.189 --> 13:29.055
What little man?
The little man in here.

13:29.291 --> 13:32.350
Every time one of these phonies comes
along, it ties knots in my stomach.

13:32.428 --> 13:33.860
I can't eat.

13:33.928 --> 13:37.158
Yours is one of them, Garlopis. That's
how I knew your claim was crooked.

13:37.232 --> 13:38.755
So what did I do?

13:38.832 --> 13:41.425
I sent a tow car over to your
garage this afternoon...

13:41.502 --> 13:43.366
and they jacked up that
burned-out truck of yours.

13:43.436 --> 13:44.959
And what did they find?

13:45.038 --> 13:48.336
They found what was left
of a neat pile of shavings.

13:48.807 --> 13:49.966
What shavings?

13:50.042 --> 13:53.602
The ones you soaked with
kerosene and dropped a match on.

13:54.879 --> 13:59.372
Look, Mister, I'm just a poor
guy. Maybe I made a mistake.

13:59.649 --> 14:01.741
That's one way
of putting it.

14:01.817 --> 14:04.046
I ain't feeling so good,
Mr. Keyes.

14:04.119 --> 14:06.348
Here. Just a minute. Sign
this and you'll feel fine.

14:06.421 --> 14:09.287
Sign what? It's a waiver
on your claim. Right here.

14:10.524 --> 14:11.888
Here?
Here.

14:15.494 --> 14:18.656
Now you're an honest man
again. Goodbye, Garlopis.

14:18.731 --> 14:20.664
But I ain't got no more truck.

14:20.732 --> 14:23.131
$2,600 is lot of dough
where I live.

14:23.201 --> 14:25.691
What's the matter, Garlopis, don't
you know how to open the door?

14:25.769 --> 14:29.067
Just put your hand on the
knob, turn it to the left.

14:29.939 --> 14:31.906
Now pull it toward you.

14:33.675 --> 14:36.666
That's the boy.
Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

14:40.681 --> 14:42.307
What kind of an outfit
is this, anyway?

14:42.382 --> 14:45.111
Are we an insurance company, or
just a bunch of dimwitted amateurs...

14:45.185 --> 14:46.412
to write a policy
on a mug like that?

14:46.485 --> 14:48.111
Now, wait a minute, Keyes.
I don't rate this beef.

14:48.187 --> 14:49.744
I clipped a note to that
Garlopis application...

14:49.822 --> 14:50.810
to have him
thoroughly investigated...

14:50.888 --> 14:52.616
before we accepted the risk.
I know you did, Walter.

14:52.690 --> 14:55.351
I'm not beefing at you. It's the
company. It's the way they do things.

14:55.425 --> 14:56.516
The way they don't do things!

14:56.593 --> 14:59.322
The way they'll write anything just
to get it down on the sales sheet.

14:59.396 --> 15:01.886
And I'm the guy that has to sit
here up to my neck in phony claims...

15:01.964 --> 15:04.898
so they won't throw more money out the
window than they take in at the door.

15:04.966 --> 15:06.796
Okay, turn the record over,
let's hear the other side.

15:06.868 --> 15:10.200
Well, I get darn sick of trying to pick
up after a gang of fast-talking salesmen...

15:10.270 --> 15:11.964
dumb enough to sell
life insurance to a guy...

15:12.039 --> 15:13.903
who sleeps in the same bed
with four rattlesnakes.

15:13.973 --> 15:16.566
Walter, I've had 26 years of this
and let me tell you, I'm getting...

15:16.642 --> 15:18.609
Yeah, and you've loved
every minute of it, Keyes.

15:18.677 --> 15:22.510
You love it, only you worry about it
too darn much, you and your little man.

15:22.581 --> 15:24.912
You're so darn conscientious,
you're driving yourself crazy.

15:24.982 --> 15:27.711
You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday
unless you looked at the calendar.

15:27.784 --> 15:30.377
Then you'd check to see if it was
this year's or last year's calendar.

15:30.453 --> 15:31.851
Then you'd find out
who printed the calendar...

15:31.920 --> 15:34.717
<i>and find out if their calendar checked
with the World Almanac's calendar.</i>

15:34.790 --> 15:35.983
Now, that's enough
from you, Walter.

15:36.058 --> 15:39.288
Now, get out of here
before I throw my desk at you.

15:41.628 --> 15:42.651
[Flicking match]

15:42.729 --> 15:44.320
I love you, too.

15:51.269 --> 15:53.293
<i>(Walter) I really did,
too, you old crab...</i>

15:53.371 --> 15:56.669
<i>always yelling your head off,
always sore at everybody.</i>

15:56.874 --> 16:00.536
<i>But you never fooled me with your
song and dance. Not for a second.</i>

16:00.610 --> 16:03.077
<i>I kind of always knew that behind
the cigar ashes on your vest...</i>

16:03.146 --> 16:05.545
<i>you had a heart
as big as a house.</i>

16:06.114 --> 16:08.775
<i>Back in my office there was a phone
message from Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

16:08.849 --> 16:10.577
<i>about the renewals.</i>

16:10.951 --> 16:13.851
<i>She didn't want me to come
tomorrow evening.</i>

16:14.020 --> 16:17.614
<i>She wanted me to come Thursday
afternoon at 3:30 instead.</i>

16:18.090 --> 16:21.422
<i>I had a lot of stuff lined up
for that Thursday afternoon...</i>

16:21.527 --> 16:23.460
<i>including a trip
down to Santa Monica...</i>

16:23.528 --> 16:27.293
<i>to see a couple of live prospects
about some group insurance.</i>

16:27.364 --> 16:30.457
<i>But I kept thinking
about Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

16:30.600 --> 16:33.067
<i>and the way that anklet
of hers cut into her leg.</i>

16:40.507 --> 16:43.168
Hello, Mr. Neff.
Aren't you coming in?

16:44.077 --> 16:45.805
I'm considering it.

16:47.747 --> 16:50.010
I hope you didn't mind
my changing the appointment.

16:50.081 --> 16:53.049
Last night wasn't so
convenient. That's all right.

16:53.118 --> 16:55.210
I was working on
my stamp collection anyway.

16:55.286 --> 16:57.446
I was just fixing some iced
tea. Would you like a glass?

16:57.521 --> 16:59.784
Yeah, unless you've got a bottle
of beer that's not working.

16:59.856 --> 17:02.449
There may be some. I never
know what's in the icebox.

17:02.559 --> 17:03.718
Nettie.

17:07.762 --> 17:11.321
About those renewals, Mr. Neff.
I talked to my husband about it.

17:11.398 --> 17:14.127
Oh, you did? Yes. He'll
renew with you, he told me so.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.760
As a matter of fact, I thought
he'd be here this afternoon.

17:16.836 --> 17:17.994
But he's not?
No.

17:18.069 --> 17:19.093
[Chuckles]

17:19.171 --> 17:20.762
That's terrible.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.396
Nettie!

17:24.175 --> 17:26.768
Oh, I forgot,
today's the maid's day off.

17:27.845 --> 17:30.745
Never mind the beer.
Iced tea will be fine.

17:30.813 --> 17:33.110
Lemon? Sugar?
Fix it your way.

17:34.816 --> 17:38.376
As long as it's the maid's day off,
maybe there's something I can do for you.

17:38.453 --> 17:41.615
Like running the vacuum cleaner. Fresh.

17:42.089 --> 17:44.488
I used to peddle
vacuum cleaners.

17:44.557 --> 17:46.490
Not much money, but you
learn a lot about life.

17:46.559 --> 17:50.255
I didn't think you'd learned
it from a correspondence course.

17:51.797 --> 17:54.026
Where'd you pick up
this tea drinking?

17:54.098 --> 17:56.292
You're not English, are you?
No. Californian.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.425
Born right here
in Los Angeles.

17:58.501 --> 18:01.594
They say all native
Californians come from Iowa.

18:02.705 --> 18:05.195
Mr. Neff, I...
Make it Walter, huh?

18:05.274 --> 18:07.138
Walter.
That's right.

18:07.542 --> 18:11.910
Tell me, Walter, on this insurance,
how much commission do you make?

18:12.112 --> 18:13.578
Twenty percent. Why?

18:13.647 --> 18:16.274
I thought perhaps I could throw
a little more business your way.

18:16.349 --> 18:18.942
I can always use it. I was
thinking about my husband.

18:19.018 --> 18:21.417
I worry a lot about him
down in those oil fields.

18:21.486 --> 18:23.783
It's very dangerous.
Not for an executive, is it?

18:23.855 --> 18:25.253
He doesn't just sit
behind a desk.

18:25.322 --> 18:27.619
He's right down there
with those drilling crews.

18:27.691 --> 18:28.918
It's got me worried sick.

18:28.993 --> 18:31.324
You mean, some dark night a
crown block might fall on him?

18:31.394 --> 18:33.861
Please don't talk like that.
But that's the idea.

18:33.929 --> 18:36.920
The other day a casing line
snapped and caught the foreman.

18:36.999 --> 18:39.796
He's in the hospital with
a broken back. That's bad.

18:39.867 --> 18:42.357
It's got me jittery
just thinking about it.

18:42.436 --> 18:44.665
Suppose something like that
happened to my husband.

18:44.738 --> 18:46.432
It could.
Well...

18:47.806 --> 18:51.104
don't you think he ought to
have accident insurance? Mmm-hmm.

18:52.143 --> 18:54.474
What kind of insurance
could he have?

18:54.545 --> 18:56.774
Enough to cover doctors
and hospital bills.

18:56.847 --> 18:58.905
Say $125 a week cash benefit.

18:58.982 --> 19:01.381
And he'd rate around
$50,000 capital sum.

19:01.450 --> 19:04.714
Capital sum? What's that?
In case he gets killed.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.919
Maybe I shouldn't
have said that.

19:07.989 --> 19:10.354
I suppose you have to think
of everything in your business.

19:10.424 --> 19:11.822
Well, your husband
would understand.

19:11.892 --> 19:14.689
I'm sure I could sell him on the
idea of some accident protection.

19:14.761 --> 19:16.318
Why don't I talk
to him about it?

19:16.396 --> 19:18.556
You could try,
but he's pretty tough-going.

19:18.631 --> 19:20.723
They're all tough at first.

19:21.533 --> 19:22.760
He has a lot on his mind.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.562
He doesn't seem to want
to listen to anything...

19:24.635 --> 19:27.467
except maybe
a baseball game on the radio.

19:27.805 --> 19:31.740
Sometimes we sit here all evening
and never say a word to each other.

19:31.841 --> 19:35.469
(Walter) Sounds pretty dull.
So, I just sit and knit.

19:36.845 --> 19:38.175
Is that what you
married him for?

19:38.246 --> 19:41.408
Maybe I like the way
his thumbs hold up the wool.

19:41.882 --> 19:44.145
Anytime his thumbs
get tired...

19:44.217 --> 19:46.582
Only, with me around,
you wouldn't have to knit.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.744
Wouldn't I? You bet
your life, you wouldn't.

19:51.823 --> 19:55.258
Wonder if a little rum
would get this up on its feet.

19:57.328 --> 19:59.852
I want to ask you
something, Walter.

20:02.098 --> 20:05.692
Could I get an accident policy for
him without bothering him at all?

20:05.767 --> 20:06.790
How's that, again?

20:06.868 --> 20:09.836
It would make it easier for you, too.
You wouldn't even have to talk to him.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.427
I have a little
allowance of my own.

20:11.505 --> 20:14.701
I could pay for it and he
needn't know anything about it.

20:17.143 --> 20:18.336
Why shouldn't he know?

20:18.410 --> 20:20.809
Because he doesn't want
accident insurance.

20:20.879 --> 20:24.814
He's superstitious about it. A lot
of people are. That's funny, isn't it?

20:24.882 --> 20:29.045
If there was a way to get it like
that, all the worry would be over.

20:29.987 --> 20:33.080
See what I mean, Walter?
Sure. I got good eyesight.

20:33.155 --> 20:35.884
You mean you want him to have
the policy without him knowing it.

20:35.958 --> 20:38.983
And that means without the insurance
company knowing that he doesn't know it.

20:39.060 --> 20:41.857
That's the setup, isn't it? Is
there anything wrong with it?

20:41.929 --> 20:43.259
No, I think it's lovely.

20:43.330 --> 20:45.763
Then, if some dark, wet night,
that crown block did fall on him...

20:45.832 --> 20:46.889
What crown block?

20:46.966 --> 20:50.059
Only sometimes it can't quite make it
on its own, it has to have a little help.

20:50.135 --> 20:51.465
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:51.536 --> 20:52.968
Of course, it doesn't have
to be a crown block.

20:53.038 --> 20:56.131
It can be a car backing over him, or he
could fall out of the upstairs window.

20:56.207 --> 20:58.299
Any little thing like that,
just so it's a morgue job.

20:58.376 --> 21:00.605
Are you crazy?
Not that crazy.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.407
Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
What's the matter?

21:06.749 --> 21:09.376
Look, baby,
you can't get away with it.

21:11.252 --> 21:12.843
You want to knock him off,
don't you?

21:12.919 --> 21:14.385
That's a horrible
thing to say.

21:14.454 --> 21:15.750
What'd you think
I was, anyway?

21:15.822 --> 21:18.187
A guy that walks into a good
looking dame's front parlor and says:

21:18.257 --> 21:20.224
"Good afternoon, I sell
accident insurance on husbands.

21:20.292 --> 21:21.553
"You got one that's been
around too long?

21:21.627 --> 21:23.287
"One you'd like to turn into
a little hard cash?

21:23.361 --> 21:25.260
"Just give me a smile
and I'll help you collect. "

21:25.330 --> 21:28.992
Boy, what a dope you must think
I am. I think you're rotten.

21:29.066 --> 21:31.260
I think you're swell, so
long as I'm not your husband.

21:31.334 --> 21:34.268
Get out of here. You bet
I'll get out of here, baby.

21:34.337 --> 21:36.531
I'll get out of here,
but quick.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.946
<i>(Walter) So I let her have
it straight between the eyes.</i>

21:49.015 --> 21:51.539
<i>She didn't fool me
for a minute, not this time.</i>

21:51.784 --> 21:53.250
<i>I knew I had hold
of a red-hot poker...</i>

21:53.318 --> 21:56.047
<i>and the time to drop it was
before it burned my hand off.</i>

21:56.788 --> 22:00.689
<i>I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of
beer, the one I had wanted all along...</i>

22:00.757 --> 22:04.624
<i>only I wanted it worse now, to get rid
of the sour taste of her iced tea...</i>

22:04.693 --> 22:06.592
<i>and everything
that went with it.</i>

22:06.695 --> 22:09.857
<i>I didn't want to go back to the office
so I dropped by a bowling alley...</i>

22:09.931 --> 22:12.455
<i>at Third and Western
and rolled a few lines...</i>

22:12.533 --> 22:15.626
<i>to get my mind thinking about
something else for a while.</i>

22:16.469 --> 22:20.700
<i>I didn't feel like eating dinner when
I left, and I didn't feel like a show.</i>

22:20.773 --> 22:24.173
<i>So, I drove home, put the car
away and went up to my apartment.</i>

22:26.010 --> 22:28.409
<i>It had begun to rain outside
and I watched it get dark...</i>

22:28.479 --> 22:30.537
<i>and didn't even
turn on the light.</i>

22:30.947 --> 22:32.413
<i>That didn't help me either.</i>

22:32.982 --> 22:34.312
<i>I was all twisted up inside...</i>

22:34.384 --> 22:37.216
<i>and I was still holding on
to that red-hot poker.</i>

22:37.586 --> 22:41.351
<i>And right then it came over me that I
hadn't walked out on anything at all.</i>

22:41.556 --> 22:43.887
<i>That the hook
was too strong...</i>

22:43.957 --> 22:46.516
<i>that this wasn't the end
between her and me.</i>

22:46.660 --> 22:48.251
<i>It was only the beginning.</i>

22:48.327 --> 22:49.350
[Doorbell ringing]

22:49.428 --> 22:53.761
<i>So at 8:00 the bell would ring and I'd
know who it was without even having to think.</i>

22:54.099 --> 22:56.760
<i>As if it was the most
natural thing in the world.</i>

23:00.504 --> 23:03.472
Hello. You forgot your hat
this afternoon.

23:04.273 --> 23:06.900
Did I? Don't you want me to bring it in?

23:07.609 --> 23:08.734
Sure.

23:10.545 --> 23:12.239
Put it on the chair.

23:20.953 --> 23:23.420
How'd you know where I live?
It's in the phone book.

23:24.289 --> 23:26.017
It's raining.
Yeah.

23:27.091 --> 23:28.955
Peel off your coat
and sit down.

23:32.062 --> 23:33.119
Your husband out?

23:33.196 --> 23:35.186
Yes. Long Beach. They're
spudding in a new well.

23:35.264 --> 23:37.424
He phoned he'd be late.
About 9:30.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.794
It's about time you said
you were glad to see me.

23:40.869 --> 23:42.301
I knew you wouldn't
leave it like that.

23:42.370 --> 23:45.361
Like what?
Like it was this afternoon.

23:45.439 --> 23:48.737
I must have said something that
gave you a terribly wrong impression.

23:48.808 --> 23:51.708
You must never think anything
like that about me, Walter.

23:51.777 --> 23:53.038
Okay.
No, it's not okay.

23:53.111 --> 23:55.943
Not if you don't believe me.
What do you want me to do?

23:56.947 --> 23:58.641
I want you to be nice to me.

23:59.450 --> 24:01.940
Like the first time
you came to the house.

24:02.018 --> 24:04.247
It can't be
like the first time.

24:04.320 --> 24:07.117
Something's happened.
I know it has.

24:07.923 --> 24:09.685
It's happened to us.

24:12.226 --> 24:16.218
I feel as if he was watching me.
Not that he cares. Not anymore.

24:17.597 --> 24:20.531
He keeps me on a leash
so tight I can't breathe.

24:20.599 --> 24:23.123
He's in Long Beach,
isn't he? Relax.

24:23.502 --> 24:25.526
Maybe I oughtn't
to have come.

24:25.603 --> 24:28.298
Maybe you oughtn't.
You want me to go?

24:28.372 --> 24:30.669
If you want to.
Right now?

24:30.741 --> 24:32.037
Sure, right now.

24:46.553 --> 24:47.985
[Walter sighing]

24:48.321 --> 24:51.551
I'm crazy about you, baby.
I'm crazy about you, Walter.

24:51.790 --> 24:54.349
That perfume on your hair.
What's the name of it?

24:54.793 --> 24:57.386
I don't know.
I bought it in Ensenada.

24:58.496 --> 25:00.656
You ought to have some of that
pink wine to go with it.

25:00.730 --> 25:03.630
The kind that bubbles.
All I got is bourbon.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.664
Bourbon is fine, Walter.

25:13.707 --> 25:15.571
Get a couple of glasses,
will you?

25:23.215 --> 25:25.148
Club soda?
Plain water, please.

25:26.818 --> 25:30.014
You know, about six months ago a guy
slipped on a cake of soap in his bathtub...

25:30.087 --> 25:32.418
and knocked himself cold
and was drowned.

25:32.889 --> 25:34.856
Only he had
accident insurance.

25:34.924 --> 25:37.448
So they had an autopsy and
she didn't get away with it.

25:37.526 --> 25:39.618
Who didn't?
His wife.

25:41.729 --> 25:44.196
Then there was a case of a guy
who was found shot.

25:44.298 --> 25:47.494
His wife said he was cleaning a
gun and his stomach got in the way.

25:48.201 --> 25:51.192
All she collected was a
three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.

25:52.037 --> 25:54.061
Perhaps it was
worth it to her.

25:56.307 --> 25:58.900
See if you can carry that
as far as the living room.

26:02.779 --> 26:05.872
It's nice here, Walter.
Who takes care of it for you?

26:05.948 --> 26:08.541
A colored woman comes in
a couple of times a week.

26:08.617 --> 26:11.676
Cook your own breakfast? Squeeze
a grapefruit once in a while.

26:11.786 --> 26:14.686
Get the rest down at the corner
drugstore. Sounds wonderful.

26:14.755 --> 26:16.483
Just strangers beside you.

26:16.924 --> 26:19.255
You don't know them
and you don't hate them.

26:19.425 --> 26:20.948
You don't have to
sit across the table...

26:21.027 --> 26:24.223
and smile at him and that daughter
of his every morning of your life.

26:24.296 --> 26:27.560
What daughter? You mean the
little girl on the piano?

26:27.932 --> 26:29.660
Lola. She lives with us.

26:29.734 --> 26:32.258
He thinks a lot more of her
than he does of me.

26:32.669 --> 26:35.068
You ever think of a divorce?
He wouldn't give me a divorce.

26:35.138 --> 26:36.570
I suppose because it'd
cost him too much money.

26:36.639 --> 26:39.198
He hasn't got any money. Not since
he went into the oil business.

26:39.275 --> 26:41.037
But he had
when you married him?

26:41.542 --> 26:45.637
Yes, he had.
And I wanted a home. Why not?

26:46.813 --> 26:50.111
But that's not the only
reason. I was his wife's nurse.

26:50.182 --> 26:53.776
She was sick a long time. When she
died, he was terribly broken up.

26:55.220 --> 26:57.312
I pitied him so.
And now you hate him.

26:57.522 --> 27:00.285
Yes, Walter.
He's so mean to me.

27:00.658 --> 27:03.319
Every time I buy a dress or a pair
of shoes he yells his head off.

27:03.393 --> 27:05.121
He never lets me go anywhere.
He keeps me shut up.

27:05.194 --> 27:06.888
He's always been mean to me.

27:07.196 --> 27:10.858
Even his life insurance all
goes to that daughter of his.

27:11.667 --> 27:14.066
That Lola.
Nothing for you at all?

27:14.168 --> 27:16.567
No. And nothing is just
what I'm worth to him.

27:17.637 --> 27:21.037
So you lie awake in the dark and
listen to him snore and get ideas.

27:21.674 --> 27:24.107
Walter, I don't want
to kill him. I never did.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.503
Not even when he gets drunk
and slaps my face.

27:30.380 --> 27:33.405
Only sometimes you wish
he was dead. Perhaps I do.

27:33.483 --> 27:37.213
Then you wish it was an accident,
and you had that policy for $50,000.

27:37.687 --> 27:39.813
Is that it?
Perhaps that, too.

27:41.990 --> 27:45.083
The other night we drove home
from a party. He was drunk again.

27:45.426 --> 27:48.986
When we drove into the garage, he just sat
there with his head on the steering wheel...

27:49.062 --> 27:50.790
and the motor still running.

27:51.297 --> 27:54.857
And I thought what it would be
like if I didn't switch it off...

27:55.701 --> 27:58.294
just closed the garage doors
and left him there.

27:58.369 --> 27:59.528
I'll tell you what
it'd be like.

27:59.603 --> 28:02.196
If you had that accident policy
and tried to pull a monoxide job...

28:02.272 --> 28:04.364
We've got a guy
in our office named Keyes.

28:04.441 --> 28:07.432
For him a setup like that'd be just
like a slice of rare roast beef.

28:07.543 --> 28:09.339
In three minutes he'd know
it wasn't an accident.

28:09.411 --> 28:11.503
In 10 minutes you'd be sitting
under the hot lights.

28:11.579 --> 28:13.739
In a half-hour you'd be signing
your name to a confession.

28:13.815 --> 28:15.645
But, Walter, I didn't do it
and I'm not going to do it.

28:15.716 --> 28:17.979
Not if there's an insurance
company in the picture, baby.

28:18.051 --> 28:20.143
They know more tricks
than a carload of monkeys.

28:20.219 --> 28:22.709
And if there's a death mixed up
in it, you haven't got a prayer.

28:22.788 --> 28:25.847
They'll hang you just as sure
as ten dimes will buy a dollar.

28:26.191 --> 28:28.215
And I don't want you
to hang, baby.

28:31.228 --> 28:33.195
Stop thinking about it,
will you?

28:36.733 --> 28:38.427
<i>(Walter)
So we just sat there.</i>

28:38.800 --> 28:42.860
<i>She started crying softly, like the rain
on the window, and we didn't say anything.</i>

28:43.137 --> 28:45.934
<i>Maybe she had stopped thinking
about it, but I hadn't.</i>

28:46.207 --> 28:47.230
I couldn't.

28:47.308 --> 28:50.743
Because it all tied up with something
I'd been thinking about for years.

28:50.810 --> 28:53.539
Since long before I ever
ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.

28:54.513 --> 28:56.480
Because you know
how it is, Keyes.

28:57.014 --> 28:58.173
In this business
you can't sleep...

28:58.249 --> 29:01.081
for trying to figure out all the
tricks they could pull on you.

29:01.151 --> 29:02.617
You're like the guy
behind the roulette wheel...

29:02.686 --> 29:05.984
watching the customers to make
sure they don't crook the house.

29:06.489 --> 29:09.719
And then one night, you get to thinking
how you could crook the house yourself.

29:09.792 --> 29:11.315
And do it smart.

29:11.393 --> 29:13.485
Because you've got that wheel
right under your hands.

29:13.561 --> 29:15.687
You know every notch in it
by heart.

29:15.929 --> 29:18.453
And you figure all you need
is a plant out front.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.595
A shill to put down the bet.

29:21.634 --> 29:22.759
And suddenly
the doorbell rings...

29:22.835 --> 29:25.268
and the whole setup is right
there in the room with you.

29:29.106 --> 29:32.199
Look, Keyes, I'm not trying
to whitewash myself.

29:33.176 --> 29:36.633
I fought it, only I guess
I didn't fight it hard enough.

29:38.247 --> 29:41.943
The stakes were $50,000, but
they were the life of a man, too.

29:42.884 --> 29:45.317
A man who'd never
done me any dirt, except...

29:46.020 --> 29:48.613
he was married to a woman
he didn't care anything about.

29:50.190 --> 29:51.383
<i>And I did.</i>

30:03.600 --> 30:06.534
Will you phone me? Walter?

30:09.438 --> 30:12.235
I hate him.
I loathe going back to him.

30:12.374 --> 30:15.240
You believe me, don't you,
Walter? Sure I believe you.

30:18.078 --> 30:21.205
I can't stand it anymore.
What if they did hang me?

30:21.281 --> 30:23.612
They're not going
to hang you, baby.

30:23.682 --> 30:25.239
It's better than
going on this way.

30:25.317 --> 30:26.476
They're not gonna
hang you because...

30:26.552 --> 30:28.348
you're gonna do it
and I'm gonna help you.

30:28.419 --> 30:31.114
Do you know what you're saying?
Sure, I know what I'm saying.

30:31.189 --> 30:32.678
We're gonna do it
and we're gonna do it right.

30:32.756 --> 30:35.883
And I'm the guy that knows
how. Walter, you're hurting me.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.950
There's not going to be any slip-up.
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.

30:39.028 --> 30:40.460
It's got to be perfect.

30:53.306 --> 30:55.830
Call me tomorrow. But not
from your house. From a booth.

30:55.907 --> 30:57.771
And watch your step
every single minute.

30:57.843 --> 31:00.970
This has got to be perfect, you
understand? Straight down the line.

31:01.679 --> 31:04.203
Straight down the line.

31:31.502 --> 31:33.332
[Rain pattering]

31:36.172 --> 31:37.900
[Car engine starts]

31:40.175 --> 31:41.937
[Car driving away]

31:46.747 --> 31:48.441
<i>(Walter)
That was it, Keyes.</i>

31:48.516 --> 31:51.541
<i>The machinery had started to
move and nothing could stop it.</i>

31:52.252 --> 31:55.709
The first thing we had to do was
fix him up with that accident policy.

31:56.154 --> 31:59.919
I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted
was his signature on an application.

32:00.458 --> 32:03.483
So I had to get him to sign without
his knowing what he was signing.

32:04.728 --> 32:08.561
And I wanted another witness besides
Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk.

32:09.331 --> 32:11.059
I was trying to think
with your brains, Keyes...

32:11.133 --> 32:13.259
because I wanted
all the answers ready...

32:13.334 --> 32:17.827
for all the questions you were gonna
spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.

32:18.071 --> 32:20.368
A couple of nights later
I went to the house.

32:21.140 --> 32:25.200
Everything looked fine, except I didn't
like the witness Phyllis had brought in.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.770
It was Dietrichson's
daughter, Lola.

32:28.747 --> 32:31.340
And it made me feel
a little queer in the belly...

32:31.415 --> 32:34.474
to have her sitting right there in
the room, playing Chinese checkers...

32:35.552 --> 32:37.143
<i>as if nothing
were going to happen.</i>

32:39.088 --> 32:40.714
(Walter) I suppose you
realize, Mr. Dietrichson...

32:40.789 --> 32:42.085
that, not being an employee...

32:42.157 --> 32:44.454
you are not covered by the
State Compensation Insurance Act.

32:44.525 --> 32:47.823
The only way you can protect yourself is
by having a personal policy of your own.

32:47.895 --> 32:49.054
Yeah, I know
all about that.

32:49.129 --> 32:50.595
The next thing
you'll tell me I need...

32:50.664 --> 32:54.190
earthquake insurance and lightning
insurance and hail insurance.

32:54.266 --> 32:55.994
If we bought all the insurance
they can think up...

32:56.068 --> 32:57.864
we'd stay broke paying
for it, wouldn't we, honey?

32:57.936 --> 33:01.803
What keeps us broke is you going
out and buying five hats at a crack.

33:01.873 --> 33:03.567
Who needs a hat in California?

33:03.640 --> 33:05.334
Dollar for dollar,
Mr. Dietrichson...

33:05.409 --> 33:07.842
accident insurance is the
cheapest coverage you can buy.

33:07.910 --> 33:10.776
Well, maybe some other time,
Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.

33:10.846 --> 33:11.937
Just as you say.

33:12.013 --> 33:14.810
Suppose we just settle that
automobile insurance tonight.

33:14.916 --> 33:16.109
Sure.

33:16.350 --> 33:19.750
All we'll need on that is for you
to sign the application for renewal.

33:19.887 --> 33:21.717
Phyllis, do you mind
if we don't finish this game?

33:21.788 --> 33:24.153
It bores me stiff.
Got something better to do?

33:24.223 --> 33:25.484
Yes, I have.

33:26.758 --> 33:28.588
Father, is it all right
if I run along now?

33:28.660 --> 33:31.787
Run along where? Who with? Just
Anne. We're going roller-skating.

33:31.862 --> 33:33.624
Anne who?
Anne Matthews.

33:33.698 --> 33:35.665
It's not that Nino
Zachetti again, is it?

33:35.732 --> 33:37.130
It better not be
that Zachetti guy.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.427
If I ever catch you
with that...

33:38.500 --> 33:39.864
It's Anne Matthews,
I told you.

33:39.935 --> 33:42.027
And I also told you
we're going roller-skating.

33:42.104 --> 33:45.197
I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont
and Franklin, the northwest corner...

33:45.273 --> 33:47.740
in case you're interested,
and I'm late already.

33:47.808 --> 33:50.367
I hope that's all quite clear.
Good night, Father.

33:50.544 --> 33:52.807
Good night, Phyllis. Good
night, Miss Dietrichson.

33:52.878 --> 33:54.868
I'm sorry. Good night, Mr... Neff.

33:54.947 --> 33:56.607
Good night, Mr. Neff.

33:59.651 --> 34:01.618
A great little fighter
for her weight.

34:03.020 --> 34:05.112
Now, if you'll just
sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.

34:05.189 --> 34:07.588
Sign what? The applications
for the auto renewals.

34:07.657 --> 34:09.623
So you'll be covered until
the new policies are issued.

34:09.692 --> 34:11.386
When will that be?
About a week.

34:11.460 --> 34:13.393
Just so I'm covered
when I drive up north.

34:13.462 --> 34:15.292
San Francisco?
Palo Alto.

34:15.362 --> 34:17.091
He was a Stanford man,
Mr. Neff.

34:17.164 --> 34:19.597
And he still goes to his
class reunion every year.

34:19.666 --> 34:23.226
What's wrong with that? Can't I
have a little fun, even once a year?

34:23.303 --> 34:24.963
Great football school,
Stanford.

34:25.036 --> 34:27.027
Did you play football, Mr.
Dietrichson? Left guard.

34:27.106 --> 34:28.732
Almost made the varsity, too.
Where do I sign?

34:28.806 --> 34:30.136
The bottom line.

34:34.777 --> 34:36.802
Both copies, please.
Sign twice, huh?

34:36.880 --> 34:38.176
Yes. One is
the agent's copy.

34:38.246 --> 34:42.205
I need it for my files.
Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

34:47.955 --> 34:49.420
Thank you,
Mr. Dietrichson.

34:49.489 --> 34:52.322
Don't worry about the check, I can
pick it up at your office some morning.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.621
How much you taking me for?
$147.50.

34:54.694 --> 34:57.389
I think that's enough insurance
for one evening, Mr. Neff.

34:57.462 --> 34:58.655
Plenty.

35:02.566 --> 35:05.227
Bring me some soda when you come
up, Phyllis. Good night, Mr. Neff.

35:05.301 --> 35:06.324
Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.

35:06.403 --> 35:08.996
I think you left your hat
in the hall, Mr. Neff.

35:24.517 --> 35:26.313
Good night, Mr. Neff.

35:28.987 --> 35:30.180
All right, Walter?
Fine.

35:30.255 --> 35:32.154
He signed it, didn't he? Sure
he signed it. You saw him.

35:32.222 --> 35:34.155
Now, listen. That trip to
Palo Alto. When does he leave?

35:34.224 --> 35:35.212
End of the month.

35:35.292 --> 35:36.280
He drives, huh?
He always drives.

35:36.360 --> 35:37.986
Not this time. You're gonna
make him take the train.

35:38.061 --> 35:39.618
Why? Because it's all
worked out for a train.

35:39.696 --> 35:42.061
Listen, baby. There's a clause
in every accident policy...

35:42.130 --> 35:43.994
a little thing called
double indemnity.

35:44.066 --> 35:46.966
The insurance companies put it in as
a sort of come-on for the customers.

35:47.034 --> 35:49.194
That means they pay double
on certain accidents.

35:49.270 --> 35:50.896
The kind that almost
never happen.

35:50.970 --> 35:53.460
Like for instance, if a guy
is killed on the train...

35:53.540 --> 35:55.973
they pay $100,000
instead of $50,000.

35:56.041 --> 35:58.474
I see. We're hitting
it for the limit, baby.

35:58.544 --> 36:01.068
That's why
it's got to be the train.

36:02.380 --> 36:05.212
It'll be the train, Walter.
Just the way you want it.

36:05.282 --> 36:07.181
Straight down the line.

36:26.566 --> 36:28.157
(Lola)
Hello, Mr. Neff.

36:29.568 --> 36:30.795
It's me.

36:31.535 --> 36:33.900
Is anything wrong?
I've been waiting for you.

36:33.971 --> 36:35.062
For me? Why?

36:35.139 --> 36:38.437
I thought you could let me ride
with you, if you're going my way.

36:43.579 --> 36:47.036
Which way would that be?
Down the hill. Down Vermont.

36:47.115 --> 36:50.106
Sure. Vermont and Franklin.
Northwest corner, wasn't it?

36:50.183 --> 36:51.513
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.

36:55.955 --> 36:57.922
Going roller-skating, huh?

36:58.057 --> 37:01.423
You like roller-skating?
I can take it or leave it.

37:02.594 --> 37:05.494
Only tonight you're
leaving it? Yes, I am.

37:06.897 --> 37:09.524
I'm having
a very tough time at home.

37:09.599 --> 37:12.965
My father doesn't understand
me and Phyllis hates me.

37:13.401 --> 37:16.927
Sounds tough, all right. That's
why I have to lie sometimes.

37:17.004 --> 37:18.402
You mean it's not
Vermont and Franklin?

37:18.472 --> 37:20.405
It's Vermont and Franklin
all right.

37:20.474 --> 37:23.601
Only it's not Anne Matthews.
It's Nino Zachetti.

37:24.778 --> 37:26.745
You won't tell on me,
will you?

37:26.812 --> 37:29.541
I'd have to think it over. Nino's
not what my father says at all.

37:29.615 --> 37:32.708
He's just had bad luck.
He was doing premed at USC...

37:32.784 --> 37:35.752
and working nights as an usher
in a theater downtown.

37:35.819 --> 37:38.480
Got behind in his credits,
flunked out.

37:38.622 --> 37:42.580
Then he lost his job for
talking back. He's so hot-headed.

37:43.793 --> 37:45.089
Becomes expensive, doesn't it?

37:45.160 --> 37:47.650
Guess my father thinks nobody's
good enough for his daughter...

37:47.729 --> 37:49.958
except maybe the guy that
owns Standard Oil.

37:50.030 --> 37:53.795
I wish he'd see it my way.
I can't give Nino up.

37:55.201 --> 37:57.395
It'll all straighten out,
Miss Dietrichson.

37:57.470 --> 38:01.633
I suppose it will sometime. This
is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.

38:04.074 --> 38:06.837
(Lola)
Nino? Over here, Nino.

38:15.517 --> 38:18.076
This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
Hello, Nino.

38:18.319 --> 38:19.785
The name is Zachetti.

38:19.854 --> 38:22.515
Nino, please. Mr. Neff gave
me a ride from the house.

38:22.589 --> 38:23.680
I told him all about us.

38:23.757 --> 38:25.121
Why does he have to
get told about us?

38:25.191 --> 38:27.181
We don't have to worry
about Mr. Neff, Nino.

38:27.259 --> 38:28.816
I'm not doing any worrying.

38:28.894 --> 38:30.190
Just don't you
broadcast so much.

38:30.261 --> 38:31.989
Well, what's the matter
with you, Nino?

38:32.063 --> 38:34.553
Why, he's a friend.
I don't have any friends.

38:34.631 --> 38:36.894
If I did, I like to pick
them myself. Come on.

38:36.967 --> 38:39.298
Look, sonny, she needed a
ride, so I brought her along.

38:39.368 --> 38:41.528
Is that anything
to get tough about?

38:41.604 --> 38:44.071
All right, Lola, make up your
mind. Are you coming or aren't you?

38:44.139 --> 38:45.935
Of course I'm coming.

38:48.475 --> 38:51.773
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff.
And thanks a lot for the ride.

38:51.846 --> 38:54.177
You're awfully sweet. Nino?

38:59.484 --> 39:01.280
<i>(Walter)
She was a nice kid.</i>

39:01.552 --> 39:04.520
<i>Maybe he was a little better
than he sounded.</i>

39:04.589 --> 39:08.024
<i>But right then it gave me a nasty feeling
to be thinking about them at all...</i>

39:08.091 --> 39:11.787
<i>with that briefcase right behind my head
that had her father's signature in it...</i>

39:11.861 --> 39:13.987
<i>and what that signature meant.</i>

39:14.063 --> 39:16.292
<i>It meant he was a dead pigeon.</i>

39:16.531 --> 39:20.432
<i>It was only a question of time,
and not very much time at that.</i>

39:20.500 --> 39:23.229
<i>You know that big market
up on Los Feliz, Keyes?</i>

39:24.003 --> 39:27.529
<i>That's the place Phyllis and I
had picked for a meeting place.</i>

39:27.607 --> 39:29.699
<i>I already had most of
the plan in my head...</i>

39:29.774 --> 39:32.071
<i>but a lot of details
had to be worked out.</i>

39:32.143 --> 39:35.703
<i>And she had to know them all
by heart when the time came.</i>

39:36.113 --> 39:38.740
<i>We had to be very careful
from now on.</i>

39:38.882 --> 39:41.509
<i>We couldn't let anybody
see us together.</i>

39:41.584 --> 39:44.484
<i>We couldn't even talk to
each other on the telephone.</i>

39:44.553 --> 39:47.419
<i>Not from her house
or at my office, anyway.</i>

39:48.155 --> 39:52.420
<i>So she was to be in the market every
morning about 11:00, buying stuff.</i>

39:52.659 --> 39:56.094
<i>And I could sort of run into
her there any day I wanted to.</i>

39:56.161 --> 39:58.492
<i>Sort of accidentally
on purpose.</i>

39:59.365 --> 40:01.855
Walter, I wanted to...
Not so loud.

40:03.301 --> 40:04.995
I wanted to talk to you,
ever since yesterday.

40:05.068 --> 40:07.194
Let me talk first.
It's all set.

40:07.271 --> 40:09.761
The accident policy came
through. I've got it in my pocket.

40:09.839 --> 40:12.773
I got his check, too. I saw
him down in the oil fields.

40:12.842 --> 40:14.968
He thought he was paying
for the auto insurance.

40:15.043 --> 40:17.909
The check's just made out to the
company, so it could be for anything.

40:17.979 --> 40:20.776
But you have to send a check
for the auto insurance, see?

40:20.848 --> 40:23.907
It’ll be all right that way, because
one of the cars is in your name.

40:23.983 --> 40:25.745
Open your bag. Quick.

40:26.653 --> 40:27.641
[Cash register bell dinging]

40:30.923 --> 40:32.321
Can you get in
the safe-deposit box?

40:32.390 --> 40:34.380
Yes. We both have keys.
Fine.

40:34.458 --> 40:36.755
But don't put the policy in
there yet. I'll tell you when.

40:36.826 --> 40:39.555
Remember, you never saw it, you
never even touched it, you understand?

40:39.629 --> 40:42.222
I'm not a fool. Okay. When
is he leaving on the train?

40:42.298 --> 40:43.764
That's just it. He isn't going. What?

40:43.832 --> 40:45.731
That's what I've been trying
to tell you. The trip is off.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.391
What happened?

40:49.003 --> 40:51.971
Mister, could you reach me
that package of baby food?

40:52.039 --> 40:53.699
That one up there?

40:55.641 --> 40:59.474
I don't know why they always
put what I want on the top shelf.

41:01.279 --> 41:02.438
Go ahead. I'm listening.

41:02.514 --> 41:04.879
He had a fall-down at the well.
Broke his leg. It's in a cast.

41:04.949 --> 41:07.678
Broke his leg?
What do we do now, Walter?

41:07.785 --> 41:10.378
Nothing. We just wait.
Wait for what?

41:10.453 --> 41:11.919
Until he can
take the train.

41:11.988 --> 41:13.215
I told you it's got
to be the train.

41:13.288 --> 41:14.618
But we can't wait.
I can't go on like this.

41:14.690 --> 41:17.681
Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and
do it quick, just to get it over with.

41:17.758 --> 41:20.521
There are other ways. We're
not gonna do it other ways.

41:20.594 --> 41:21.685
But we can't leave it
like this.

41:21.762 --> 41:24.696
What do you suppose would happen if
he found out about the accident policy?

41:24.764 --> 41:26.822
Plenty. But not as bad as
sitting in that death house.

41:26.899 --> 41:29.696
Don't ever talk like that. Don't let's
start losing our heads, that's all.

41:29.768 --> 41:31.962
It's not our heads.
It's our nerve we're losing.

41:32.036 --> 41:33.024
[Cash register bell dinging]

41:35.872 --> 41:37.202
Excuse me.

41:40.310 --> 41:41.901
We're gonna do it right.
That's all I said.

41:41.978 --> 41:43.467
It's the waiting
that's getting me.

41:43.546 --> 41:45.012
It's getting me
just as bad, baby.

41:45.080 --> 41:48.105
But we've got to wait.
Maybe we have, Walter, only...

41:48.183 --> 41:51.640
it's so tough without you.
It's like a wall between us.

41:53.454 --> 41:56.752
I better go, baby. I'm
thinking of you every minute.

42:02.794 --> 42:06.354
<i>(Walter) After that, a full week
went by and I didn't see her once.</i>

42:06.464 --> 42:09.921
<i>I tried to keep my mind off
her and off the whole idea.</i>

42:10.033 --> 42:12.899
<i>I kept telling myself that maybe
those Fates they say watch over you...</i>

42:12.968 --> 42:16.698
<i>had gotten together and broken
his leg to give me a way out.</i>

42:16.804 --> 42:20.762
<i>Then it was the 15th of June.
You may remember that date, Keyes.</i>

42:22.175 --> 42:25.507
<i>You came into my office
around 3:00 in the afternoon.</i>

42:26.178 --> 42:27.474
Hello, Keyes.

42:27.546 --> 42:28.773
I just came
from Norton's office.

42:28.848 --> 42:30.337
The semiannual sales
records are out.

42:30.415 --> 42:33.315
You're high man, Walter. That's
twice in a row. Congratulations.

42:33.385 --> 42:36.080
Thanks. How would you
like a cheap drink?

42:36.153 --> 42:38.643
How would you like
a $50 cut in salary?

42:38.722 --> 42:40.985
Do I laugh now or wait till
it gets funny? No, I'm serious.

42:41.057 --> 42:44.355
I've just been talking to Norton.
Too much stuff piling up on my desk.

42:44.426 --> 42:45.756
Too much pressure
on my nerves.

42:45.827 --> 42:47.851
I spend half the night
walking up and down in my bed.

42:47.929 --> 42:49.828
I've got to have an assistant
and I thought of you.

42:49.897 --> 42:51.295
Me? Why pick on me?

42:51.365 --> 42:53.889
Well, because I've got a crazy
idea you might be good at the job.

42:53.967 --> 42:55.365
That's crazy, all right.
I'm a salesman.

42:55.435 --> 42:58.631
Yeah. A peddler,
a gladhander, a backslapper.

42:59.204 --> 43:00.465
You're too good
to be a salesman.

43:00.539 --> 43:02.665
Nobody's too good to
be a salesman. Phooey!

43:02.740 --> 43:06.231
All you guys do is just ring doorbells
and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.

43:06.310 --> 43:08.470
What's troubling you
is that $50 cut, isn't it?

43:08.545 --> 43:10.068
Well, that'd trouble anybody.
Now look, Walter.

43:10.147 --> 43:13.115
The job I'm talking about
takes brains and integrity.

43:13.182 --> 43:15.081
It takes more guts than
there is in 50 salesmen.

43:15.151 --> 43:16.276
It's the hottest job
in the business.

43:16.351 --> 43:17.578
Yeah, but it's still
a desk job.

43:17.652 --> 43:19.778
I don't want to be nailed
to a desk. Desk job?

43:19.854 --> 43:21.445
Is that all you can see in it?

43:21.522 --> 43:24.490
Just a hard chair to park your
pants on from 9:00 to 5:00, huh?

43:24.558 --> 43:27.287
Just a pile of papers to shuffle
around, and five sharp pencils...

43:27.360 --> 43:31.728
and a scratch pad to make figures on,
maybe a little doodling on the side.

43:31.797 --> 43:33.821
Well, that's not the way
I look at it, Walter.

43:33.899 --> 43:37.994
To me, a claims man is a surgeon,
that desk is an operating table...

43:38.069 --> 43:40.901
and those pencils are scalpels
and bone chisels.

43:40.970 --> 43:44.769
And those papers are not just forms and
statistics and claims for compensation.

43:44.840 --> 43:47.967
They're alive.
They're packed with drama...

43:48.176 --> 43:50.370
with twisted hopes
and crooked dreams.

43:50.445 --> 43:53.675
A claims man, Walter, is a
doctor and a bloodhound and a...

43:53.747 --> 43:55.213
[telephone ringing]

43:56.149 --> 43:58.275
Who? Okay, hold on a minute.

43:58.551 --> 44:01.678
A claims man is a doctor and a bloodhound
and a cop and a judge and a jury...

44:01.753 --> 44:03.447
and a father confessor,
all in one.

44:03.521 --> 44:05.078
And you want to tell me
you're not interested?

44:05.156 --> 44:06.315
You don't want to work
with your brains?

44:06.390 --> 44:08.448
All you want to work is with
your finger on the doorbell...

44:08.525 --> 44:12.051
for a few bucks more a week.
There's a dame on your phone.

44:12.128 --> 44:14.652
Walter Neff speaking.
I had to call you, Walter.

44:14.730 --> 44:16.094
It's very urgent.
Are you with somebody?

44:17.599 --> 44:20.726
Yes, I am.
Can't I call you back, Margie?

44:21.435 --> 44:24.631
No, you can't. I've only
got a minute. It can't wait.

44:24.704 --> 44:28.002
Listen. He's going tonight. On
the train. Are you listening?

44:28.074 --> 44:30.667
Walter?
Yeah. I'm listening, Margie.

44:31.376 --> 44:33.900
Only, make it snappy,
will you? He's on crutches.

44:33.978 --> 44:37.310
The doctor says he can go if he's
careful. The change will do him good.

44:37.381 --> 44:40.144
It's wonderful, Walter. Just the
way you wanted it, on a train.

44:40.217 --> 44:42.776
Only with the crutches it makes
it much better, doesn't it?

44:42.852 --> 44:45.285
Yeah. Yeah,
that's 100% better.

44:46.888 --> 44:48.184
Hold the line a minute,
will you?

44:48.256 --> 44:50.985
Keyes, suppose I join you in your
office? That's all right. I'll wait.

44:51.059 --> 44:53.492
Only tell her
not to take all day.

44:55.262 --> 44:56.387
Go ahead.

44:56.729 --> 44:59.788
It's the 10:15 from Glendale.
I'm driving him.

44:59.866 --> 45:01.696
It's still the same
dark street, isn't it?

45:01.766 --> 45:05.030
And the signal is three honks
on the horn. Okay. Anything else?

45:05.803 --> 45:06.826
No.

45:07.104 --> 45:08.092
Oh, uh...

45:08.672 --> 45:10.263
what color did you pick?

45:10.340 --> 45:13.240
Blue. Navy blue. And the
cast is on his left leg.

45:13.977 --> 45:15.170
Mmm-hmm.

45:15.711 --> 45:17.234
Yeah, that suits me fine.

45:17.312 --> 45:19.575
This is it, Walter.
I'm shaking like a leaf.

45:19.647 --> 45:22.672
But it's straight down
the line for both of us.

45:22.750 --> 45:24.876
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.

45:26.953 --> 45:28.852
Sorry, Keyes.
What's the matter?

45:28.921 --> 45:31.650
Dames chasing you again? Or still?
Or is it none of my business?

45:31.724 --> 45:33.588
If I told you
it was a customer...

45:33.758 --> 45:35.816
Margie. I bet she drinks
from the bottle.

45:35.894 --> 45:37.758
Why don't you settle down
and get married, Walter?

45:37.828 --> 45:41.888
Why don't you, for instance? I
almost did, once. Long time ago.

45:41.964 --> 45:43.726
Now look, Keyes, I've
got to call on a prospect.

45:43.799 --> 45:46.323
Even had the church
picked out, the dame and I.

45:46.401 --> 45:48.630
She had a white satin dress
with flounces on it.

45:48.703 --> 45:51.535
I was on my way to the
jewelry store to buy the ring.

45:51.605 --> 45:54.198
And then suddenly that little
man in here started working on me.

45:54.275 --> 45:55.798
So you went back
and had her investigated?

45:55.875 --> 45:58.308
Yeah. And the stuff
that came out...

45:59.279 --> 46:01.644
She'd been dyeing her hair
ever since she was 16.

46:01.713 --> 46:04.237
There was a manic depressive in
her family, on her mother's side.

46:04.315 --> 46:05.941
She already had one husband.

46:06.017 --> 46:08.109
He was a professional
pool player in Baltimore.

46:08.186 --> 46:10.244
And as for her brother...
I get the general idea.

46:10.320 --> 46:13.948
She was a tramp from a long line of
tramps. Yeah. All right, all right.

46:14.023 --> 46:16.752
Now what do I say to Norton? What
about this job I want you for?

46:16.825 --> 46:18.382
I don't think
I want it, Keyes.

46:18.459 --> 46:20.949
Thanks just the same.
Fair enough.

46:21.896 --> 46:24.125
Only get this,
I picked you for the job...

46:24.198 --> 46:26.358
not because I think
you're so darn smart...

46:26.433 --> 46:29.765
but because I thought you were a shade
less dumb than the rest of the outfit.

46:36.941 --> 46:39.932
Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter.

46:40.177 --> 46:42.303
You're just a little taller.

46:53.221 --> 46:54.585
<i>(Walter)
Yes, Keyes.</i>

46:54.654 --> 46:58.248
<i>Those Fates I was talking about
had only been stalling me off.</i>

46:58.325 --> 47:01.691
<i>Now they had thrown the
switch. The gears had meshed.</i>

47:01.794 --> 47:04.421
<i>The time for thinking
had all run out.</i>

47:05.163 --> 47:08.893
<i>I wanted my movements accounted
for up to the last possible moment.</i>

47:08.966 --> 47:13.095
<i>So when I left the office I put my rate
book on the desk as if I had forgotten it.</i>

47:13.169 --> 47:15.193
<i>That was part of my alibi.</i>

47:16.639 --> 47:19.368
<i>From here on, it was a question
of following the timetable...</i>

47:19.441 --> 47:20.464
<i>move by move.</i>

47:22.309 --> 47:25.402
<i>I got home about 7:00 and
drove right into the garage.</i>

47:25.479 --> 47:28.413
<i>This was another item
to establish my alibi.</i>

47:29.782 --> 47:32.079
Hi, Mr. Neff.
Hello, Charlie.

47:32.150 --> 47:33.980
How about giving
the heap a wash job?

47:34.052 --> 47:35.211
How soon you gonna want it?

47:35.286 --> 47:36.684
I got a couple cars
ahead of you.

47:36.754 --> 47:38.277
Any time you get
to it, Charlie.

47:38.356 --> 47:40.585
I'm staying in tonight.
Okay.

47:40.690 --> 47:42.657
<i>(Walter) Up in my apartment
I called Lou Schwartz...</i>

47:42.726 --> 47:45.023
<i>one of the salesmen
that shared my office.</i>

47:45.094 --> 47:48.494
<i>He lived in Westwood, so it was a toll
call and there'd be a record of it.</i>

47:48.564 --> 47:50.861
<i>I told him I'd forgotten my
rate book and needed some dope...</i>

47:50.932 --> 47:53.866
<i>on the public liability bond
I was figuring.</i>

47:54.001 --> 47:57.766
<i>I changed into a navy blue suit
like Dietrichson was going to wear.</i>

47:57.837 --> 48:00.930
<i>Lou Schwartz called me back
and gave me a lot of figures.</i>

48:01.007 --> 48:03.440
<i>I stuffed a hand towel and a roll
of adhesive into my pockets...</i>

48:03.508 --> 48:07.500
<i>so I could fake something that
looked like a cast on a broken leg.</i>

48:07.578 --> 48:09.602
<i>Next, I stuck a card
inside the telephone box...</i>

48:09.680 --> 48:12.512
<i>so that it would fall down
if the bell rang.</i>

48:12.582 --> 48:16.073
<i>That way I'd know if anybody
had called me while I was away.</i>

48:16.151 --> 48:20.348
<i>Then I did the same thing to the
doorbell in case anybody came to see me.</i>

48:20.855 --> 48:24.483
<i>I left the apartment by the
service stairs. Nobody saw me.</i>

48:25.492 --> 48:28.756
<i>I walked all the way from my
apartment to the Dietrichson house.</i>

48:28.828 --> 48:30.192
<i>I didn't want
to take the bus...</i>

48:30.262 --> 48:33.924
<i>because there was always the chance that
someone might remember seeing me on it.</i>

48:33.999 --> 48:35.989
<i>I was being that careful.</i>

48:36.401 --> 48:38.994
<i>I could smell that
honeysuckle again.</i>

48:39.102 --> 48:42.264
<i>Only it was even stronger,
now that it was night.</i>

48:46.676 --> 48:49.872
<i>I slid the garage door open
as quietly as I could.</i>

48:50.211 --> 48:53.270
<i>She'd backed the sedan in,
just the way I told her to.</i>

48:53.347 --> 48:54.836
<i>I'd figured it was
safer that way...</i>

48:54.915 --> 48:57.974
<i>in case he got into the car
before she drove it out.</i>

48:58.051 --> 49:00.348
<i>I got into
the back of the car.</i>

49:00.420 --> 49:02.887
<i>I lay there on the floor
and waited.</i>

49:02.954 --> 49:06.047
<i>All the time I was thinking about that
dark street on the way to the station...</i>

49:06.123 --> 49:07.919
<i>where I was to do it...</i>

49:07.992 --> 49:10.755
<i>and the three honks on the
horn that were to be the signal.</i>

49:10.827 --> 49:13.226
<i>About 10 minutes later
they came down.</i>

49:13.296 --> 49:15.024
All right, honey?
Yeah, I'm all right.

49:15.097 --> 49:17.530
I'll have the car out
in a second.

49:35.380 --> 49:36.778
[Inaudible]

49:54.328 --> 49:57.626
Take it easy, honey. We've
got lots of time. Yeah.

50:16.979 --> 50:19.071
Remember what the doctor said.
If you get careless...

50:19.147 --> 50:20.875
you might end up
with a shorter leg.

50:20.949 --> 50:24.748
So what? I could break the other
one and match them up again.

50:25.119 --> 50:27.609
It makes you feel pretty good
to get away from me, doesn't it?

50:27.688 --> 50:31.384
It's only for four days. I'll
be back Monday at the latest.

50:47.469 --> 50:50.767
This is not the right street.
Why did you turn here?

50:53.207 --> 50:54.639
[Honking]

50:54.709 --> 50:56.835
What are you doing that for?

50:57.844 --> 51:00.311
What are you
honking the horn for?

51:00.646 --> 51:02.476
[Dietrichson choking]

51:22.930 --> 51:24.328
[Train horn blowing]

51:54.855 --> 51:57.015
[Bell ringing]

52:00.460 --> 52:02.450
You take care of the redcap
and the conductor.

52:02.528 --> 52:04.859
Don't worry. Keep away
from me as much as you can.

52:04.930 --> 52:07.397
Tell them I don't want to be
helped. I said, don't worry, Walter.

52:07.466 --> 52:09.695
You start as soon as
the train leaves.

52:09.767 --> 52:12.428
When you get to the refinery, turn
off the highway onto the dirt road.

52:12.502 --> 52:14.059
From there it's exactly
eight-tenths of a mile...

52:14.137 --> 52:15.569
to the dump beside the tracks.
Remember.

52:15.638 --> 52:18.162
I remember everything.
No speeding.

52:19.508 --> 52:22.203
You don't want any cops stopping
you with him in the back.

52:22.276 --> 52:24.641
Walter, we've been through
all that so many times.

52:24.712 --> 52:26.975
When you leave the highway,
turn off all your lights.

52:27.080 --> 52:29.172
I'll be back on
the observation platform.

52:29.249 --> 52:31.910
I'll drop off as close to
the spot as I can.

52:31.984 --> 52:35.043
Let the train pass,
then dim your lights twice.

52:37.589 --> 52:40.523
San Francisco train, lady? Car
9, section 11. Just my husband.

52:40.591 --> 52:43.081
Car 9, section 11?
This way please.

52:51.166 --> 52:53.099
Thank you. My husband
doesn't like to be helped.

52:53.168 --> 52:55.032
Car number 8. Up there.

53:00.340 --> 53:03.934
Car 9, section 11. Thank you.

53:06.545 --> 53:08.944
Here're the tickets. Take good
care of yourself with that leg.

53:09.013 --> 53:10.377
Yeah. You take it easy
driving home.

53:10.448 --> 53:13.883
I'll miss you, honey.
Section 11, sir.

53:15.785 --> 53:17.649
(Porter) All aboard! Thank you.

53:17.753 --> 53:19.879
Goodbye, honey.
All aboard!

53:21.155 --> 53:23.179
[Train whistle blowing]

53:25.692 --> 53:27.318
Good luck, honey.

53:35.934 --> 53:37.525
Porter, will you make up
my berth right away?

53:37.602 --> 53:38.659
Yes, sir.

53:38.737 --> 53:40.431
I'm going back to the
observation car for a smoke.

53:40.504 --> 53:42.198
Right this way, sir.

54:08.359 --> 54:10.326
[Train whistle blowing]

54:14.031 --> 54:15.497
(Jackson)
Like a chair?

54:17.700 --> 54:20.634
No, thanks. I'd rather stand.

54:22.037 --> 54:25.437
You going far?
Palo Alto.

54:26.307 --> 54:27.364
My name's Jackson.

54:27.441 --> 54:30.637
I'm going all the way
to Medford. Medford, Oregon.

54:31.044 --> 54:33.034
I had a broken arm once.

54:33.545 --> 54:36.843
That darn cast itches
something fierce, doesn't it?

54:36.949 --> 54:39.246
I thought I'd go crazy
with mine.

54:39.317 --> 54:43.377
Palo Alto's a nice little
town. You a Stanford man?

54:44.187 --> 54:48.384
I used to be. I'll bet
you left something behind.

54:49.158 --> 54:50.556
I always do.

54:50.726 --> 54:54.092
My cigar case. I guess I left it
in my overcoat back in the section.

54:54.162 --> 54:57.494
Would you care to roll
yourself a cigarette, Mister...

54:57.564 --> 54:58.552
Dietrichson.

54:59.066 --> 55:01.556
No thanks,
I really prefer a cigar.

55:02.268 --> 55:05.464
Maybe the porter could... Well,
I could get your cigars for you.

55:05.537 --> 55:08.903
Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.
If it's not too much trouble.

55:08.974 --> 55:12.773
Car 9, section 11. Car 9,
section 11. With pleasure.

55:57.044 --> 55:58.601
Okay. This has gotta be fast.

55:58.679 --> 56:02.170
Here, take his hat. Pick up
the crutches back on the tracks.

56:31.438 --> 56:33.302
Okay, baby. That's it.

56:49.285 --> 56:51.309
[Engine faltering]

[Engine choking]

57:24.012 --> 57:26.206
[Engine starting]

57:31.617 --> 57:33.379
All right. Let's go.

57:43.260 --> 57:45.090
<i>(Walter) On the way back,
we went over once more...</i>

57:45.161 --> 57:46.593
<i>what she was to do
at the inquest...</i>

57:46.663 --> 57:50.393
<i>if they had one, and about the
insurance, when that came up.</i>

57:50.532 --> 57:53.591
<i>I was afraid she might go to pieces
a little, now that we had done it.</i>

57:53.668 --> 57:58.262
<i>But she was perfect. No nerves. Not
a tear, not even a blink of the eyes.</i>

57:59.272 --> 58:02.331
<i>She dropped me a block
from my apartment house.</i>

58:03.142 --> 58:06.599
Walter, what's the matter?
Aren't you going to kiss me?

58:11.516 --> 58:14.143
It's straight down the line,
isn't it?

58:18.888 --> 58:22.345
I love you, Walter.
I love you, baby.

58:35.501 --> 58:39.266
<i>It was two minutes past 11:00, as
I went up the service stairs again.</i>

58:39.337 --> 58:43.329
<i>Nobody saw me this time either. In
the apartment I checked the bells.</i>

58:43.406 --> 58:46.397
<i>The cards hadn't moved.
No calls. No visitors.</i>

58:47.911 --> 58:51.869
<i>Then I changed my clothes again.
That left one last thing to do.</i>

58:52.847 --> 58:56.839
<i>I had to go down to the garage.
I wanted Charlie to see me again.</i>

59:03.523 --> 59:06.423
You gonna use your car, after
all? I'm not quite through.

59:06.491 --> 59:08.355
Well, that's all right,
Charlie.

59:08.426 --> 59:10.518
Just going up to the drugstore
to get something to eat.

59:10.595 --> 59:13.563
Been working upstairs all night. My
stomach's getting a little sore at me.

59:13.631 --> 59:15.222
Yes, sir, Mr. Neff.

59:17.167 --> 59:19.157
<i>That was all there was to it.</i>

59:19.235 --> 59:21.896
<i>Nothing had slipped,
nothing had been overlooked.</i>

59:21.970 --> 59:24.369
<i>There was nothing
to give us away.</i>

59:24.438 --> 59:28.066
<i>And yet, Keyes, as I was walking
down the street to the drugstore...</i>

59:28.142 --> 59:31.577
<i>suddenly it came over me that
everything would go wrong.</i>

59:31.645 --> 59:34.841
<i>It sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it's true, so help me.</i>

59:35.014 --> 59:37.413
<i>I couldn't hear
my own footsteps.</i>

59:40.585 --> 59:42.814
<i>It was the walk of a dead man.</i>

59:50.726 --> 59:53.285
That was the longest night
I ever lived through, Keyes...

59:53.361 --> 59:57.228
and the next day was worse, when
the story had broke in the papers...

59:57.298 --> 59:59.197
and they started talking
about it at the office...

59:59.266 --> 01:00:02.496
and the day after that, when
you started digging into it.

01:00:02.569 --> 01:00:06.504
I kept my hands in my pockets
because I thought they were shaking.

01:00:06.572 --> 01:00:08.801
I put on dark glasses so
people couldn't see my eyes.

01:00:08.874 --> 01:00:12.832
And then I took them off again so they
wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:15.605
I tried to
hold myself together, but...

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.937
<i>I could feel my nerves
pulling me to pieces.</i>

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:24.516
Oh, Walter?
Hello, Keyes.

01:00:24.786 --> 01:00:26.946
Come along. The big boss
wants to see us.

01:00:27.021 --> 01:00:29.318
The Dietrichson case?
Must be.

01:00:29.489 --> 01:00:31.456
Anything wrong?
Well, the guy is dead.

01:00:31.525 --> 01:00:35.426
We had him insured and it's gonna
cost us dough. That's always wrong.

01:00:35.494 --> 01:00:37.757
What have they got so far?
Autopsy report.

01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:41.457
No heart failure, no apoplexy, no
predisposing medical cause of any kind.

01:00:41.533 --> 01:00:43.397
Died of a broken neck.

01:00:43.534 --> 01:00:45.558
When's the inquest?
Had it this morning.

01:00:45.636 --> 01:00:47.694
His wife and daughter
made the identification.

01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:50.567
The train people and some of the
passengers told how he went through...

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.901
to the observation car.

01:00:51.974 --> 01:00:55.534
It was all over in 45 minutes.
Verdict? Accidental death.

01:00:57.144 --> 01:00:58.610
What do the police figure?

01:00:58.679 --> 01:01:01.340
That he got tangled up in his
crutches and fell off the train.

01:01:01.414 --> 01:01:03.040
They're satisfied.

01:01:03.116 --> 01:01:05.743
It's not their dough.
Come on, Walter.

01:01:07.219 --> 01:01:09.083
(Norton) All right. Thank
you very much, gentlemen.

01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:11.380
I believe the legal position
is now clear.

01:01:11.456 --> 01:01:13.787
Please stand by.
I may need you later.

01:01:13.857 --> 01:01:16.723
Come in, Mr. Keyes.
You, too, Mr. Neff.

01:01:21.063 --> 01:01:23.360
You find this an uncomfortably
warm day, Mr. Keyes?

01:01:23.431 --> 01:01:26.422
I'm sorry, Mr. Norton, but I
didn't know this was formal.

01:01:26.501 --> 01:01:27.865
Sit down, gentlemen.
Thank you.

01:01:27.935 --> 01:01:28.958
Any new developments?

01:01:29.036 --> 01:01:31.663
I just talked to this Jackson long
distance, up in Medford, Oregon.

01:01:31.738 --> 01:01:32.761
Who's Jackson?

01:01:32.839 --> 01:01:34.362
He's the last man who saw
Dietrichson alive.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.999
They were out on the observation
platform together, talking.

01:01:37.075 --> 01:01:39.133
Dietrichson wanted a cigar
and so Jackson went back...

01:01:39.211 --> 01:01:40.871
to get Dietrichson's
cigar case for him.

01:01:40.945 --> 01:01:43.310
When he returned to the observation
platform, no Dietrichson.

01:01:43.381 --> 01:01:45.245
Well, Jackson didn't think
anything was wrong until...

01:01:45.315 --> 01:01:47.282
a wire caught up with
the train at Santa Barbara.

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:50.079
They found Dietrichson's body
on the tracks near Burbank.

01:01:50.152 --> 01:01:52.642
Very interesting about
the cigar case.

01:01:52.721 --> 01:01:54.711
Anything else?
No, not much.

01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:57.780
Dietrichson's secretary says she
didn't know anything about the policy.

01:01:57.859 --> 01:02:01.225
There's a daughter, but all she
remembers is Neff talking to her father...

01:02:01.295 --> 01:02:03.524
about accident insurance
at their house one night.

01:02:03.596 --> 01:02:04.960
I couldn't sell him at first.

01:02:05.031 --> 01:02:07.965
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it.
He said he'd think it over.

01:02:08.033 --> 01:02:11.229
Later I saw him in the
oil fields and closed him.

01:02:11.303 --> 01:02:13.327
He signed the application
and gave me his check.

01:02:13.404 --> 01:02:15.803
A fine piece of salesmanship
that was, Mr. Neff.

01:02:15.873 --> 01:02:17.499
Well, there's no sense in
pushing Neff around.

01:02:17.573 --> 01:02:19.540
He's got the best
sales record in the office.

01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:22.873
Are your salesmen supposed to know a
customer is going to fall off the train?

01:02:22.945 --> 01:02:26.744
Fall off a train? Are we sure
Dietrichson fell off the train?

01:02:27.114 --> 01:02:29.411
I don't get it.
You don't, Mr. Keyes?

01:02:29.483 --> 01:02:30.972
Then what do you
think of this case?

01:02:31.051 --> 01:02:32.813
This policy might cost us
a great deal of money.

01:02:32.886 --> 01:02:35.012
As you know, it contains
a double indemnity clause.

01:02:35.088 --> 01:02:36.850
Just what is your opinion?

01:02:36.922 --> 01:02:38.650
No opinion at all.
Not even a hunch?

01:02:38.724 --> 01:02:41.089
One of those interesting
little hunches of yours?

01:02:41.159 --> 01:02:42.489
Nope. Not even a hunch.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:46.256
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've
formed a very definite opinion.

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:49.992
I think I know. In fact, I know I
know what happened to Dietrichson.

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:53.432
You know you know what?
I know it was not an accident.

01:02:56.805 --> 01:02:59.364
What do you say to that?
Me?

01:03:00.741 --> 01:03:03.140
Well, you've got the ball.
Let's see you run with it.

01:03:03.209 --> 01:03:06.769
There's a widespread feeling that just
because a man has a large office...

01:03:06.846 --> 01:03:08.005
[intercom buzzing]

01:03:09.848 --> 01:03:12.543
Yes? Have her come in, please.

01:03:13.084 --> 01:03:14.641
There's a widespread
feeling that...

01:03:14.719 --> 01:03:18.017
just because a man has a large
office, he must be an idiot.

01:03:18.088 --> 01:03:20.021
I'm having a visitor,
if you don't mind.

01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:23.058
No, no. I want you to stay
and watch me handle this.

01:03:23.125 --> 01:03:24.751
Mrs. Dietrichson.

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:31.363
Thank you very much
for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.

01:03:31.431 --> 01:03:34.194
I assure you I appreciate
it. This is Mr. Keyes.

01:03:34.267 --> 01:03:35.733
How do you do?
How do you do?

01:03:35.801 --> 01:03:37.825
And Mr. Neff. I've met
Mr. Neff. How do you do?

01:03:37.903 --> 01:03:40.462
Mrs. Dietrichson.
Won't you sit down?

01:03:43.108 --> 01:03:44.938
(Norton) May I extend our
sympathy in your bereavement?

01:03:45.009 --> 01:03:47.499
I hesitated before asking you to
come here so soon after your loss.

01:03:47.578 --> 01:03:51.240
But now that you're here I hope you won't
mind if I plunge straight into business?

01:03:51.314 --> 01:03:52.871
You know why we asked
you to come, don't you?

01:03:52.948 --> 01:03:55.541
No. All I know is that your
secretary made it sound very urgent.

01:03:55.617 --> 01:03:57.743
Your husband had an accident
policy with this company.

01:03:57.818 --> 01:03:59.512
Evidently you don't know that,
Mrs. Dietrichson.

01:03:59.587 --> 01:04:02.316
No. I remember some talk at the
house, but he didn't seem to want it.

01:04:02.389 --> 01:04:05.687
Your husband took the policy out
a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:08.249
You'll probably find the policy
among his personal effects.

01:04:08.327 --> 01:04:10.089
His safe-deposit box
hasn't been opened yet.

01:04:10.162 --> 01:04:12.152
It seems a tax examiner
has to be present.

01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:13.924
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I don't want you to think...

01:04:13.998 --> 01:04:15.430
you're being subjected to
any questioning...

01:04:15.499 --> 01:04:17.125
but there are a few things
we should like to know.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.223
What sort of things?

01:04:18.635 --> 01:04:20.795
We have the report of
the coroner's inquest.

01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:23.929
Accidental death.
We are not entirely satisfied.

01:04:24.006 --> 01:04:26.599
In fact,
we are not satisfied at all.

01:04:28.543 --> 01:04:31.170
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson,
we suspect...

01:04:32.413 --> 01:04:33.743
a suicide.

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:40.516
I'm sorry. Would you like
a glass of water? Please.

01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:46.619
Thank you.

01:04:52.594 --> 01:04:56.154
Had your husband been depressed
or moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?

01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:58.993
Did he have financial worries,
for instance?

01:04:59.067 --> 01:05:02.399
He was perfectly all right and I
don't know of any financial worries.

01:05:02.469 --> 01:05:04.595
Let us examine this
so-called accident.

01:05:04.671 --> 01:05:08.800
First, your husband takes out this
policy in absolute secrecy. Why?

01:05:08.941 --> 01:05:11.875
Because he doesn't want his family
to suspect what he intends to do.

01:05:11.943 --> 01:05:14.604
Do what? Next, he goes on
this trip entirely alone.

01:05:14.678 --> 01:05:18.272
He has to be alone. He hobbles all the
way out to the observation platform.

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:22.010
Very unlikely with his leg in a cast,
unless he has a very strong reason.

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:25.344
Once there, he finds he is not
alone. There is a man there.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:29.150
What was his name, Keyes? His name
was Jackson. Probably still is.

01:05:29.657 --> 01:05:33.353
So he gets rid of this Jackson with
some flimsy excuse about cigars.

01:05:33.426 --> 01:05:36.724
And then he is alone. And
then he does it. Does what?

01:05:36.796 --> 01:05:40.492
He jumps. Suicide. In which
case, the company is not liable.

01:05:40.866 --> 01:05:43.732
You know that, of course.
Now, we could go to court...

01:05:43.801 --> 01:05:47.600
I don't know anything. In fact,
I don't know why I came here.

01:05:47.804 --> 01:05:51.102
Just a moment, please. I said we could
go to court. I didn't say we want to.

01:05:51.173 --> 01:05:54.073
What I want to suggest is
a compromise on both sides.

01:05:54.143 --> 01:05:56.610
A settlement for a certain
sum, a part of the policy value.

01:05:56.678 --> 01:06:00.374
Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in
here, I had no idea you owed me any money.

01:06:00.447 --> 01:06:02.471
You told me you did.
Then you told me you didn't.

01:06:02.549 --> 01:06:04.982
Now you tell me you want to pay
me a part of it, whatever it is.

01:06:05.051 --> 01:06:07.382
You want to bargain with me,
at a time like this.

01:06:07.453 --> 01:06:10.819
I don't like your insinuations about my
husband, and I don't like your methods.

01:06:10.889 --> 01:06:14.619
In fact, I don't like you,
Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.

01:06:17.728 --> 01:06:18.785
[Door slamming]

01:06:19.429 --> 01:06:22.693
(Keyes) Nice going, Mr. Norton.
You sure carried that ball.

01:06:22.764 --> 01:06:24.128
Only you fumbled
on the goal line.

01:06:24.199 --> 01:06:27.395
Then you heaved an illegal forward
pass and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.

01:06:27.468 --> 01:06:30.402
Now you can't pick yourself up because
you haven't got a leg to stand on.

01:06:30.471 --> 01:06:33.496
I haven't, eh? She can go to court
and we can prove it was suicide.

01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:35.062
Oh, can we?

01:06:35.142 --> 01:06:38.975
Mr. Norton, the first thing that
struck me was that suicide angle.

01:06:39.044 --> 01:06:42.774
Only I dumped it into the wastepaper
basket just three seconds later.

01:06:42.847 --> 01:06:46.407
You know, you ought to take a look
at the statistics on suicide sometime.

01:06:46.483 --> 01:06:48.950
You might learn a little something
about the insurance business.

01:06:49.019 --> 01:06:51.145
Mr. Keyes, I was raised
in the insurance business.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.982
Yeah, in the front office.

01:06:53.055 --> 01:06:56.217
Come now, you've never read an
actuarial table in your life, have you?

01:06:56.291 --> 01:06:58.554
Why, they've got 10 volumes
on suicide alone.

01:06:58.627 --> 01:07:00.423
Suicide by race, by color,
by occupation...

01:07:00.494 --> 01:07:02.484
by sex, by seasons of
the year, by time of day.

01:07:02.563 --> 01:07:05.929
Suicide, how committed? By poisons,
by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.

01:07:05.999 --> 01:07:08.660
Suicide by poison, subdivided
by types of poison...

01:07:08.734 --> 01:07:11.361
such as corrosive, irritant,
systemic, gaseous, narcotic...

01:07:11.436 --> 01:07:12.902
alkaloid, protein,
and so forth.

01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:15.665
Suicide by leaps, subdivided
by leaps from high places...

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.866
under the wheels of trains,
under the wheels of trucks...

01:07:17.941 --> 01:07:21.205
under the feet of horses, from
steamboats. But, Mr. Norton...

01:07:21.444 --> 01:07:24.970
of all the cases on record there's not
one single case of suicide by leap...

01:07:25.047 --> 01:07:26.411
from the rear end
of a moving train.

01:07:26.481 --> 01:07:28.243
And do you know how fast
that train was going...

01:07:28.316 --> 01:07:31.284
at the point where the body
was found? 15 miles an hour.

01:07:31.351 --> 01:07:33.511
Now how can anybody jump off
a slow moving train like that...

01:07:33.587 --> 01:07:36.453
with any kind of expectation
that he would kill himself?

01:07:36.522 --> 01:07:38.216
No. No soap, Mr. Norton.

01:07:38.291 --> 01:07:41.384
We're sunk, and we'll have to pay
through the nose, and you know it.

01:07:41.459 --> 01:07:43.050
May I have this?

01:07:46.397 --> 01:07:47.988
Come on, Walter.

01:07:51.134 --> 01:07:53.328
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

01:08:09.782 --> 01:08:12.215
<i>(Walter) I could have hugged you
right then and there, Keyes...</i>

01:08:12.283 --> 01:08:13.840
<i>you and your statistics.</i>

01:08:13.918 --> 01:08:16.647
<i>You were the only one
we were really scared of...</i>

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.448
<i>and instead you were
almost playing on our team.</i>

01:08:19.656 --> 01:08:22.680
<i>That evening when I got home,
my nerves had eased off.</i>

01:08:22.758 --> 01:08:24.782
<i>I could feel the ground
under my feet again.</i>

01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:27.657
<i>And it looked like easy going
from there on in.</i>

01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:29.992
<i>That $100,000 looked
as safe for Phyllis and me...</i>

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:32.725
<i>as if we had the check
already deposited in the bank.</i>

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.426
[Phone ringing]

01:08:39.136 --> 01:08:43.538
Hello? Oh, hello, baby.
Sure, everything is fine.

01:08:44.375 --> 01:08:45.932
You were wonderful
in Norton's office.

01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:49.240
I felt so funny, I wanted to
look at you all the time.

01:08:49.312 --> 01:08:51.836
How do you think I felt, baby?
Where are you?

01:08:51.915 --> 01:08:54.508
At the drugstore.
Just a block away.

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:56.841
Can I come up?
Okay. But be careful.

01:08:56.919 --> 01:08:58.680
Don't let anybody see you.

01:09:10.029 --> 01:09:11.723
[Doorbell ringing]

01:09:24.973 --> 01:09:26.439
Hello, Keyes.

01:09:32.113 --> 01:09:34.740
What's on your mind?
That broken leg.

01:09:35.282 --> 01:09:38.375
The guy had a broken leg.
What are you talking about?

01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:41.975
Talking about Dietrichson. He
had accident insurance, didn't he?

01:09:42.254 --> 01:09:44.312
Yeah. Then he broke his leg, didn't he?

01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:46.322
So what?
And he didn't put in a claim.

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:50.156
Why didn't he put in a claim?
Why? What are you driving at?

01:09:50.327 --> 01:09:55.126
Walter, I had dinner two hours
ago and it stuck half way.

01:09:55.197 --> 01:09:56.891
That little man of yours
is acting up again, huh?

01:09:56.965 --> 01:09:59.296
There's something wrong
with the Dietrichson case.

01:09:59.367 --> 01:10:03.200
Why? Because he didn't file a claim?
Maybe he just didn't have time.

01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:06.261
Maybe he just didn't know that
he was insured.

01:10:08.441 --> 01:10:09.930
No. No, that couldn't be it.

01:10:10.008 --> 01:10:12.202
You delivered the policy
to him personally, didn't you?

01:10:12.277 --> 01:10:13.300
Yeah.
You got his check?

01:10:13.378 --> 01:10:14.537
Sure I did.

01:10:15.346 --> 01:10:18.280
Got any bicarbonate of soda?
No, I haven't.

01:10:19.016 --> 01:10:22.678
Walter, I've been living with
this little man for 26 years.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:25.846
And he's never failed me yet.
There's got to be something wrong.

01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:28.354
Well, maybe Norton was right.
Maybe it was suicide.

01:10:28.423 --> 01:10:30.014
No. Not suicide.

01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:33.684
But not an accident, either.
What else?

01:10:34.227 --> 01:10:35.454
Now look, Walter.

01:10:35.529 --> 01:10:38.497
A guy takes out an accident
policy that's worth $100,000...

01:10:38.564 --> 01:10:39.621
if he's killed on a train.

01:10:39.699 --> 01:10:41.598
Then two weeks later,
he is killed on a train.

01:10:41.667 --> 01:10:45.659
And not in a train accident, mind you,
but falling off some silly observation car.

01:10:45.737 --> 01:10:48.398
Do you know what the mathematical
probability of that is?

01:10:48.472 --> 01:10:51.372
One out of I don't know
how many billions.

01:10:52.141 --> 01:10:56.803
And add to that the broken leg. No,
it just can't be the way it looks.

01:10:57.346 --> 01:11:01.372
Something has been worked
on us. Such as what?

01:11:09.388 --> 01:11:10.581
Murder?

01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:12.954
Don't you have any peppermint
or something?

01:11:13.025 --> 01:11:15.822
Sorry. Want a little
soda water? No, no, no.

01:11:17.195 --> 01:11:18.183
(Walter)
Who do you suspect?

01:11:18.261 --> 01:11:20.194
(Keyes) Maybe I like to
make things easy for myself.

01:11:20.263 --> 01:11:22.287
But I always tend to suspect
the beneficiary.

01:11:22.366 --> 01:11:23.457
You mean the wife?
Yeah.

01:11:23.532 --> 01:11:26.091
That wide-eyed dame that just
didn't know anything about anything.

01:11:26.168 --> 01:11:28.192
You're crazy, Keyes.
She wasn't even on the train.

01:11:28.269 --> 01:11:29.530
I know she wasn't, Walter.

01:11:29.604 --> 01:11:31.833
I don't claim to know how it
was worked, or who worked it...

01:11:31.905 --> 01:11:34.338
but all I know is that
it was worked.

01:11:34.408 --> 01:11:36.136
I've got to
get to a drugstore.

01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:39.178
This thing feels like
a hunk of concrete inside me.

01:11:39.245 --> 01:11:41.940
Good night, Walter.
Good night, Keyes.

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.214
See you at the office
in the morning. Yeah.

01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:48.843
I'd like to move in on her
right now, tonight.

01:11:48.919 --> 01:11:53.082
If it wasn't for Norton and his
striped-pants ideas about company policy...

01:11:53.156 --> 01:11:55.817
I'd have the police after her
so fast it'd make her head spin.

01:11:55.891 --> 01:11:57.448
They'd put her
through the wringer...

01:11:57.526 --> 01:12:00.358
and, brother, the things
they would squeeze out.

01:12:00.428 --> 01:12:02.452
Only you haven't got a
single thing to go on, Keyes.

01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:04.827
Not too much.
Just 26 years experience...

01:12:04.898 --> 01:12:09.129
all the percentage there is, and
this hunk of concrete in my stomach.

01:12:11.303 --> 01:12:13.566
Can I have
one of those things?

01:12:24.414 --> 01:12:26.904
Good night, Keyes.
So long, Walter.

01:12:30.519 --> 01:12:31.678
[Elevator door shuts]

01:12:40.325 --> 01:12:43.521
How much does he know?
He doesn't know anything.

01:12:44.163 --> 01:12:46.323
It's those stinking
hunches of his.

01:12:46.397 --> 01:12:47.727
And he can't prove anything,
can he?

01:12:47.799 --> 01:12:51.791
Not if we're careful. Not if we
don't see each other for a while.

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:56.362
How long a while?
Until this dies down.

01:12:56.439 --> 01:12:57.427
You don't know Keyes.

01:12:57.506 --> 01:12:59.564
Once he gets his teeth into
something, he never lets go.

01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:01.335
He'll investigate you,
have you shadowed.

01:13:01.409 --> 01:13:04.206
He'll watch you
every minute from now on.

01:13:04.278 --> 01:13:06.768
You afraid, baby?
Yes, I'm afraid.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:11.838
But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of
us. We're not the same anymore.

01:13:11.917 --> 01:13:15.079
We did it so we could be together, but
instead of that it's pulling us apart.

01:13:15.153 --> 01:13:16.915
Isn't it, Walter?
What are you talking about?

01:13:16.987 --> 01:13:20.683
And you don't really care
whether we see each other or not.

01:13:22.158 --> 01:13:23.647
Shut up, baby.

01:13:27.896 --> 01:13:30.295
<i>(operator) Pacific All
Risk. Good afternoon.</i>

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.191
Hello, Mr. Neff.

01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:37.226
Hello.
Lola Dietrichson.

01:13:37.604 --> 01:13:40.538
Don't you remember me?
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:13:40.673 --> 01:13:42.867
Could I talk with you
just a few minutes?

01:13:42.942 --> 01:13:45.375
Somewhere where
we could be alone?

01:13:45.610 --> 01:13:47.804
Oh, yes. Come into my office.

01:13:54.150 --> 01:13:56.310
Is it something about
what happened?

01:13:56.385 --> 01:13:59.979
Yes, Mr. Neff.
It's about my father's death.

01:14:01.056 --> 01:14:02.647
I'm terribly sorry,
Miss Dietrichson.

01:14:06.392 --> 01:14:08.985
Lou, do you mind if I use the
office alone for a few minutes?

01:14:09.062 --> 01:14:10.961
No. It's all yours, Walter.

01:14:17.935 --> 01:14:19.492
Look at me, Mr. Neff.

01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:23.027
I'm not crazy. I'm not
hysterical. I'm not even crying.

01:14:24.107 --> 01:14:27.564
But I have the awful feeling
that something is wrong...

01:14:27.877 --> 01:14:31.676
and I had that same feeling
once before, when my mother died.

01:14:31.746 --> 01:14:32.769
When your mother died?

01:14:32.847 --> 01:14:35.246
We were at Lake Arrowhead.
That was six years ago.

01:14:35.315 --> 01:14:36.303
We had a cabin there.

01:14:36.383 --> 01:14:40.716
It was winter and very cold. My
mother was very sick with pneumonia.

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:42.748
She had a nurse with her.

01:14:42.854 --> 01:14:45.845
There were just
the three of us in the cabin.

01:14:45.957 --> 01:14:48.652
One night I got up and
went into my mother's room.

01:14:48.726 --> 01:14:50.590
She was delirious with fever.

01:14:50.661 --> 01:14:54.357
All the bed covers were on the
floor and the windows were wide open.

01:14:54.464 --> 01:14:55.623
The nurse wasn't in the room.

01:14:55.698 --> 01:14:57.892
I ran and covered my mother up
as quickly as I could.

01:14:57.966 --> 01:15:00.695
Just then I heard
a door open behind me.

01:15:01.335 --> 01:15:03.199
The nurse stood there.

01:15:03.738 --> 01:15:07.366
She didn't say a word, but
there was a look in her eyes...

01:15:07.541 --> 01:15:09.201
I'll never forget.

01:15:11.277 --> 01:15:14.370
Two days later,
my mother was dead.

01:15:17.682 --> 01:15:20.013
Do you know who
that nurse was?

01:15:20.217 --> 01:15:21.877
No. Who?
Phyllis.

01:15:22.352 --> 01:15:24.717
I tried to tell my father,
but I was just a kid then.

01:15:24.787 --> 01:15:27.949
He wouldn't listen to me. Six
months later she married him...

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:32.426
and I kind of talked myself out of the
idea she could have done anything like that.

01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:36.953
But now it's all back again, now that
something's happened to my father, too.

01:15:37.031 --> 01:15:40.864
You're not making sense, Miss
Dietrichson. Your father fell off a train.

01:15:40.934 --> 01:15:43.959
Yes, and two days before he fell off
that train, what was Phyllis doing?

01:15:44.036 --> 01:15:46.526
She was in her room in front of
a mirror, with a black hat on...

01:15:46.604 --> 01:15:47.934
pinning a black veil to it.

01:15:48.005 --> 01:15:51.405
As if she couldn't wait to see
how she would look in mourning.

01:15:51.508 --> 01:15:53.532
You've had a pretty bad shock,
Miss Dietrichson.

01:15:53.610 --> 01:15:55.236
Aren't you just
imagining these things?

01:15:55.345 --> 01:15:56.777
I caught her eyes
in the mirror.

01:15:56.845 --> 01:15:59.870
They had that look in them
they had before my mother died.

01:15:59.949 --> 01:16:01.438
That same look.

01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:03.912
You don't like
your stepmother, do you?

01:16:03.985 --> 01:16:05.815
Isn't it just because
she is your stepmother?

01:16:05.886 --> 01:16:08.319
I loathe her because she did
it. She did it for the money.

01:16:08.388 --> 01:16:10.719
Only you're not going to
pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?

01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:13.917
She's not going to get away with it
this time, because I'm going to speak up.

01:16:13.992 --> 01:16:15.481
I'm going to
tell everything I know.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:19.893
You'd better be careful, saying things
like... I'm not afraid. You'll see.

01:16:20.965 --> 01:16:22.363
[Sobbing]

01:16:28.203 --> 01:16:29.533
I'm sorry.

01:16:32.907 --> 01:16:35.204
I didn't mean to
act like this.

01:16:36.476 --> 01:16:39.535
All this that you've been telling
me, who else have you told?

01:16:39.613 --> 01:16:40.806
No one.

01:16:40.947 --> 01:16:43.437
How about your stepmother?
Of course not.

01:16:44.416 --> 01:16:45.939
I've moved out.

01:16:47.051 --> 01:16:49.177
I'm not living
at home anymore.

01:16:49.253 --> 01:16:51.812
And you haven't told that
boyfriend of yours? Zachetti?

01:16:51.888 --> 01:16:54.788
I'm not seeing him anymore.
We had a fight.

01:16:56.392 --> 01:16:58.222
Where are you living now?

01:16:58.294 --> 01:17:01.285
I got myself a little
apartment in Hollywood.

01:17:01.563 --> 01:17:04.531
Four walls, and you just
sit and look at them?

01:17:05.399 --> 01:17:06.888
Yes, Mr. Neff.

01:17:09.736 --> 01:17:11.259
<i>(Walter) So that evening
I took her to dinner...</i>

01:17:11.337 --> 01:17:14.999
<i>at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera
Street where nobody would see us.</i>

01:17:15.073 --> 01:17:17.063
<i>I wanted to cheer her up.</i>

01:17:17.475 --> 01:17:20.910
<i>The next day was Sunday and we
went for a ride down to the beach.</i>

01:17:20.978 --> 01:17:23.707
<i>She had loosened up a bit,
she was even laughing.</i>

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:27.340
<i>I had to make sure that she wouldn't tell
that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.</i>

01:17:27.416 --> 01:17:30.350
<i>It was dynamite,
whether it was true or not.</i>

01:17:30.552 --> 01:17:32.382
<i>And I had no chance
to talk to Phyllis.</i>

01:17:32.453 --> 01:17:34.647
<i>You were watching her
like a hawk, Keyes.</i>

01:17:34.722 --> 01:17:39.055
<i>I couldn't even phone her because I
was afraid you had the wires tapped.</i>

01:17:39.259 --> 01:17:43.251
<i>Monday morning there was a note on my
desk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.</i>

01:17:43.329 --> 01:17:46.297
<i>For a minute I wondered
if it could be about Lola.</i>

01:17:46.364 --> 01:17:47.830
<i>It was worse.</i>

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:52.358
<i>Outside your door was the last
guy in the world I wanted to see.</i>

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:03.500
Come in. Come in, Walter.

01:18:05.012 --> 01:18:07.912
Hello, Keyes.
I want to ask you something.

01:18:08.348 --> 01:18:10.212
After all the years
we've known each other...

01:18:10.283 --> 01:18:12.216
do you mind if I make
a rather blunt statement?

01:18:12.284 --> 01:18:13.875
About what?
About me.

01:18:14.486 --> 01:18:17.147
Walter, I'm a very great man.
Yeah?

01:18:17.221 --> 01:18:19.984
This Dietrichson business,
it's murder...

01:18:20.058 --> 01:18:22.048
and murders don't come
any neater.

01:18:22.125 --> 01:18:24.991
As fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever ran into...

01:18:25.062 --> 01:18:27.325
smart, tricky,
almost perfect, but...

01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:30.697
I think Papa has it
all figured out.

01:18:30.765 --> 01:18:34.598
Figured out and wrapped up in
tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:37.397
Go ahead. I'm listening.
You know what?

01:18:37.771 --> 01:18:40.705
That guy Dietrichson
was never on the train.

01:18:41.874 --> 01:18:43.898
He wasn't?
No, he wasn't.

01:18:45.477 --> 01:18:47.774
Now look, Walter. You can't
be sure of killing a man...

01:18:47.846 --> 01:18:50.973
by throwing him off a train
that's going 15 miles an hour.

01:18:51.048 --> 01:18:53.515
The only way you can be sure
is to kill him first...

01:18:53.583 --> 01:18:55.516
and then throw
his body on the tracks.

01:18:55.585 --> 01:18:57.779
Now that would mean either
killing him on the train...

01:18:57.853 --> 01:19:01.583
or, and this is where it really gets
fancy, you kill him somewhere else...

01:19:01.657 --> 01:19:02.850
and put him on the tracks.

01:19:02.924 --> 01:19:06.188
Two possibilities, and I
personally buy the second.

01:19:07.427 --> 01:19:08.950
You're way ahead of me,
Keyes.

01:19:09.062 --> 01:19:10.824
Well, look, Walter,
it was like this.

01:19:11.097 --> 01:19:14.759
They killed the guy, the wife
and a somebody else...

01:19:15.034 --> 01:19:18.434
and the somebody else took the crutches
and went on the train as Dietrichson...

01:19:18.503 --> 01:19:20.265
then the somebody
else jumped off...

01:19:20.337 --> 01:19:22.896
then they put the body on the
tracks where the train had passed.

01:19:22.973 --> 01:19:25.634
An impersonation, see?
A cinch to work.

01:19:26.442 --> 01:19:28.568
Because it was night,
very few people were about...

01:19:28.644 --> 01:19:30.167
they have the crutches
to stare at...

01:19:30.245 --> 01:19:32.712
they never really looked
at the man at all.

01:19:32.781 --> 01:19:34.941
Fancy all right, Keyes, but
maybe it's a little too fancy.

01:19:35.015 --> 01:19:38.381
Is it? I tell you, it all
fits together like a watch.

01:19:39.052 --> 01:19:40.951
Now let's see what we have
in the way of proof.

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:43.920
The only guy who really got a good
look at this supposed Dietrichson...

01:19:43.989 --> 01:19:46.115
is sitting
right outside my office.

01:19:46.191 --> 01:19:49.626
I took the trouble to bring
him down here from Oregon.

01:19:51.362 --> 01:19:54.194
Come here, Mr. Jackson.
Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.

01:19:54.297 --> 01:19:55.957
These are fine cigars
you smoke.

01:19:56.032 --> 01:19:57.760
Two for a quarter.
That's what I said.

01:19:57.833 --> 01:19:59.390
Well, did you study
those photographs?

01:19:59.468 --> 01:20:01.492
Yes, indeed.
I studied them thoroughly.

01:20:01.569 --> 01:20:03.399
Very thoroughly.
Have you made up your mind?

01:20:03.471 --> 01:20:05.461
Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford
man. Medford, Oregon.

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:07.700
Up in Medford we take our time
making up our mind.

01:20:07.775 --> 01:20:10.800
Well, we're not in Medford now.
We're in a hurry. Let's have it.

01:20:10.877 --> 01:20:13.106
Are these photographs
of the late Mr. Dietrichson?

01:20:13.179 --> 01:20:14.167
Yes.

01:20:14.713 --> 01:20:16.907
Then my answer is no.
What do you mean, no?

01:20:16.982 --> 01:20:19.176
I mean, this is not
the man that was on the train.

01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:20.443
Will you swear to that?

01:20:20.518 --> 01:20:22.508
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

01:20:22.586 --> 01:20:24.951
If I say it, I mean it. If I
mean it, of course I'll swear it.

01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:26.647
There you are, Walter.
There's your proof.

01:20:26.723 --> 01:20:28.383
This is Mr. Neff,
one of our salesmen.

01:20:28.457 --> 01:20:30.447
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff.
Pleased, indeed.

01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:31.890
How are you?
Very fine, thank you.

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:34.325
Never was better.
Sit down, Mr. Jackson.

01:20:34.395 --> 01:20:37.761
Just how would you describe the man
you saw on the observation platform?

01:20:37.831 --> 01:20:40.560
Well, I'm pretty sure
he was a younger man...

01:20:40.667 --> 01:20:43.635
about 10 or 15 years younger
than the man in these photographs.

01:20:43.702 --> 01:20:45.726
Dietrichson was about 50,
wasn't he, Walter?

01:20:45.805 --> 01:20:48.204
Fifty-one,
according to the policy.

01:20:48.273 --> 01:20:51.139
The man I saw was nothing like
51 years old.

01:20:51.375 --> 01:20:53.865
Of course, it was pretty dark
out on that platform.

01:20:53.944 --> 01:20:56.207
Come to think of it, he tried
to keep his back towards me.

01:20:56.279 --> 01:20:58.906
But I'm positive just the
same. Thank you, Jackson.

01:20:58.981 --> 01:21:01.414
Of course, you understand this
matter is strictly confidential?

01:21:01.483 --> 01:21:04.576
We may need you again down here in Los
Angeles, if the case comes to court.

01:21:04.653 --> 01:21:07.416
Any time you need me, I'm entirely
at your disposal, gentlemen.

01:21:07.488 --> 01:21:10.786
Expenses paid, of course.
Oh, yes. Yes. Of course.

01:21:12.358 --> 01:21:14.985
Get me Lubin,
in the cashier's office.

01:21:15.661 --> 01:21:17.719
Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.

01:21:17.796 --> 01:21:21.891
Listen. I'm sending a man named Jackson
down to you with an expense account.

01:21:21.966 --> 01:21:24.763
Well, we brought him down here from
Medford, Oregon in connection with...

01:21:24.835 --> 01:21:26.597
the Dietrichson claim.

01:21:27.670 --> 01:21:29.796
Well, take care of his
hotel bill, will you?

01:21:29.872 --> 01:21:30.963
Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff?

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.063
(Keyes)
Yeah. He'll be right down.

01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:33.663
No. Never been up there.

01:21:33.875 --> 01:21:36.468
Wait a minute.
You go trout fishing?

01:21:36.543 --> 01:21:40.205
Maybe I saw you up Klamath
Falls way. Nope. I don't fish.

01:21:40.514 --> 01:21:43.812
You don't go fishing,
Mr. Neff. Neff. It's the name.

01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:46.943
There's a family of Neffs
in Corvallis. No relation.

01:21:47.018 --> 01:21:49.417
Let me see. This man's an
automobile dealer in Corvallis.

01:21:49.487 --> 01:21:51.818
A very reputable man, too, I'm
told. All right, Mr. Jackson.

01:21:51.889 --> 01:21:53.412
Suppose you go down to
the cashier's office.

01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:54.956
Room 27 on the 11th floor.

01:21:55.024 --> 01:21:58.322
He'll take care of your expense account
and your ticket for the train tonight.

01:21:58.394 --> 01:21:59.382
Tonight?

01:21:59.494 --> 01:22:02.724
Tomorrow morning would suit me better.
There's a very good osteopath in town...

01:22:02.798 --> 01:22:05.595
I'd like to see before
I leave. Osteopath?

01:22:06.133 --> 01:22:09.192
Well, just don't put her
on the expense account.

01:22:10.103 --> 01:22:11.626
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.

01:22:11.705 --> 01:22:14.002
It's been a pleasure.
Goodbye.

01:22:16.308 --> 01:22:20.243
There it is, Walter. It's beginning
to come apart at the seams already.

01:22:20.311 --> 01:22:23.040
Murder's never perfect. Always
comes apart sooner or later.

01:22:23.113 --> 01:22:25.580
And when two people are
involved, it's usually sooner.

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:28.549
Now, we know the Dietrichson dame
is in it, and a somebody else.

01:22:28.618 --> 01:22:30.642
Pretty soon we'll know
who that somebody else is.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.586
He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime,
somewhere, they've got to meet.

01:22:33.655 --> 01:22:34.951
Their emotions
are all kicked up.

01:22:35.023 --> 01:22:38.458
Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.
They can't keep away from each other.

01:22:38.525 --> 01:22:40.992
They may think it's twice as safe
because there are two of them.

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:42.458
But it isn't twice as safe.

01:22:42.528 --> 01:22:45.690
It's 10 times twice as dangerous.
They've committed a murder...

01:22:45.764 --> 01:22:47.890
and it's not like taking
a trolley ride together...

01:22:47.966 --> 01:22:49.728
where they can get off
at different stops.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.063
They're stuck with each other
and they've got to ride...

01:22:52.136 --> 01:22:53.602
all the way to
the end of the line.

01:22:53.671 --> 01:22:56.002
And it's a one-way trip, and
the last stop is the cemetery.

01:22:56.072 --> 01:22:57.868
She put in her claim.

01:22:58.507 --> 01:23:01.100
I'm gonna throw it
right back at her.

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:08.443
Let her sue us if she dares.

01:23:08.515 --> 01:23:11.312
I'll be ready for her
and that somebody else.

01:23:11.385 --> 01:23:13.909
They'll be digging
their own graves.

01:23:22.359 --> 01:23:25.020
Mrs. Dietrichson?
This is Jerry's Market.

01:23:25.095 --> 01:23:28.086
We just got in a shipment of that
English soap you were asking about.

01:23:28.164 --> 01:23:31.724
Will you be coming by today?
Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.

01:23:58.788 --> 01:24:01.415
Hello, Walter.
Come over here.

01:24:05.126 --> 01:24:08.060
What's the matter?
Everything's the matter.

01:24:10.097 --> 01:24:11.427
Keyes is rejecting your claim.

01:24:11.497 --> 01:24:14.090
He's sitting back with his mouth
watering, waiting for you to sue.

01:24:14.167 --> 01:24:15.963
He wants you to sue,
but you're not going to.

01:24:16.034 --> 01:24:18.934
What's he got to stop me?
He's got plenty.

01:24:21.806 --> 01:24:23.170
He's figured out how
it was worked.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.036
He knows it was somebody else
on the train...

01:24:25.108 --> 01:24:26.938
and he's dug up a witness
he thinks can prove it.

01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:29.375
Prove it how? If he rejects
that claim, I have to sue.

01:24:29.445 --> 01:24:32.936
Yeah? And then you're in court and a
lot of other things are going to come up.

01:24:33.015 --> 01:24:36.848
Like, for instance, about you
and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

01:24:37.018 --> 01:24:38.848
What about me and
the first Mrs. Dietrichson?

01:24:38.919 --> 01:24:39.942
The way she died.

01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:43.045
And about that black hat you were
trying on before you needed a black hat.

01:24:43.122 --> 01:24:44.884
Lola's been telling you
some of her cockeyed stories.

01:24:44.957 --> 01:24:47.288
She's been seeing you. I've been
seeing her, if you want to know.

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.054
So she won't yell her head off
about what she knows.

01:24:49.127 --> 01:24:51.856
She's putting on an act for you, crying
all over your shoulder, the lying...

01:24:51.930 --> 01:24:54.261
Keep her out of this. All I'm
telling you is we're not going to sue.

01:24:54.331 --> 01:24:55.524
Because you don't want
the money anymore...

01:24:55.599 --> 01:24:56.792
even if you could have it,
because she's...

01:24:56.866 --> 01:24:58.059
made you feel like
a heel all of a sudden?

01:24:58.134 --> 01:25:01.398
It isn't the money anymore. It's our
necks. We're pulling out, do you understand?

01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:04.404
Because of what Keyes can do?
You're not fooling me, Walter.

01:25:04.473 --> 01:25:06.736
It's because of Lola,
what you did to her father.

01:25:06.807 --> 01:25:09.673
You're afraid she might find out
someday and you can't take it, can you?

01:25:09.744 --> 01:25:11.677
I said, leave her out of this.

01:25:16.648 --> 01:25:17.909
It's me I'm talking about.

01:25:17.983 --> 01:25:20.143
I don't want to be left
out of it. Stop saying that.

01:25:20.218 --> 01:25:21.616
It's just that it
hasn't worked as we wanted.

01:25:21.686 --> 01:25:24.313
We can't go through with it, that's
all. We have gone through with it.

01:25:24.388 --> 01:25:25.479
The tough part
is all behind us.

01:25:25.589 --> 01:25:28.056
We just have to hold on now
and not go soft inside...

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:30.856
stick close together
the way we started out.

01:25:30.926 --> 01:25:32.187
Watch it.

01:25:49.975 --> 01:25:52.568
I loved you, Walter,
and I hated him.

01:25:52.643 --> 01:25:56.134
But I wasn't going to do anything
about it, not until I met you.

01:25:56.212 --> 01:25:59.840
You planned the whole thing.
I only wanted him dead.

01:26:00.416 --> 01:26:03.077
And I'm the one that
fixed it so he was dead.

01:26:03.152 --> 01:26:06.848
Is that what you're telling
me? And nobody's pulling out.

01:26:07.021 --> 01:26:09.580
We went into this together, we're
coming out at the end together.

01:26:09.656 --> 01:26:13.386
It's straight down the line
for both of us, remember?

01:26:20.098 --> 01:26:21.758
<i>(Walter)
Yes, I remembered.</i>

01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:26.398
<i>Just like I remembered
what you had told me, Keyes...</i>

01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:28.937
<i>about that trolley car ride...</i>

01:26:29.005 --> 01:26:31.404
<i>and how there was no getting
off till the end of the line...</i>

01:26:33.041 --> 01:26:34.940
...where the cemetery was.

01:26:36.378 --> 01:26:39.642
And then I got to thinking
what cemeteries are for.

01:26:40.314 --> 01:26:42.543
They're to put dead people in.

01:26:44.284 --> 01:26:47.946
I guess that was the first time I
ever thought about Phyllis that way.

01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.543
Dead, I mean.

01:26:50.721 --> 01:26:53.314
And how it would be
if she were dead.

01:26:54.625 --> 01:26:57.422
<i>I saw Lola three or four times
that week.</i>

01:26:58.095 --> 01:27:01.928
<i>One night we went up into the
hills behind the Hollywood Bowl.</i>

01:27:02.131 --> 01:27:04.963
<i>I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it was only with her that...</i>

01:27:05.033 --> 01:27:07.466
<i>I could relax
and let go a little.</i>

01:27:37.625 --> 01:27:39.353
Why are you crying?

01:27:41.261 --> 01:27:43.490
Not gonna tell me, huh?

01:27:43.663 --> 01:27:47.564
Of course I will, Walter. I
wouldn't tell anybody else but you.

01:27:48.801 --> 01:27:51.701
It's about Nino.
Zachetti? What about him?

01:27:51.870 --> 01:27:54.736
They killed my father
together. He and Phyllis.

01:27:54.805 --> 01:27:57.295
He helped her do it.
I know he did.

01:27:58.108 --> 01:28:00.075
What makes you say that?

01:28:00.476 --> 01:28:03.774
I've been following him. He's been
to her house, night after night.

01:28:03.845 --> 01:28:06.244
It was Phyllis
and him all along.

01:28:06.515 --> 01:28:10.575
Maybe he was just going with me as a
blind. And the night of the murder...

01:28:10.651 --> 01:28:12.743
You promised me you weren't
gonna talk like this anymore.

01:28:12.819 --> 01:28:16.345
He was supposed to pick me up
after a lecture at UCLA.

01:28:16.422 --> 01:28:19.322
But he never showed up.
He said he was sick.

01:28:20.125 --> 01:28:21.216
Sick!

01:28:21.292 --> 01:28:22.690
[Sobbing]

01:28:23.294 --> 01:28:27.696
He couldn't show up, because the
train was leaving with my father on it.

01:28:33.302 --> 01:28:36.600
Maybe I'm just crazy.
Maybe it's all in my mind.

01:28:37.639 --> 01:28:39.663
Sure, it's all in your mind.

01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:43.835
I only wish it were, Walter,
'cause I still love him.

01:28:50.215 --> 01:28:53.615
<i>(Walter) Zachetti. Phyllis and Zachetti.</i>

01:28:55.319 --> 01:28:59.379
<i>What was he doing up at her house?
I couldn't figure that one out.</i>

01:29:01.024 --> 01:29:04.117
<i>I tried to make sense
out of it and got nowhere.</i>

01:29:04.626 --> 01:29:07.617
<i>But the real braintwister
came the next day.</i>

01:29:08.095 --> 01:29:12.190
<i>You sprang it on me, Keyes, after
office hours, when you caught me...</i>

01:29:12.265 --> 01:29:14.164
<i>down in the lobby
of the building.</i>

01:29:14.234 --> 01:29:16.463
Walter. Walter, just a minute.

01:29:21.105 --> 01:29:24.130
Hello, Keyes. Just hang
on to your hat, Walter.

01:29:24.209 --> 01:29:26.176
What for?
Oh, nothing much.

01:29:26.410 --> 01:29:29.310
That Dietrichson case
just busted wide open.

01:29:29.579 --> 01:29:32.604
How do you mean?
The guy showed. That's how.

01:29:33.816 --> 01:29:36.045
What guy?
The guy who helped her do it.

01:29:36.117 --> 01:29:37.811
The somebody else?

01:29:38.719 --> 01:29:41.414
No kidding? Yeah. She
just filed suit against us.

01:29:41.488 --> 01:29:42.784
It's okay by me.

01:29:42.856 --> 01:29:45.915
When we get them in that courtroom,
I'll tear them to pieces, both of them.

01:29:45.992 --> 01:29:48.221
Come on. I'll buy you a martini,
Walter. No thanks, Keyes.

01:29:48.293 --> 01:29:49.281
With two olives.

01:29:49.361 --> 01:29:51.658
No, I've got to get a shave and
a shoeshine. I've got a date.

01:29:51.730 --> 01:29:54.823
Margie. I still bet she drinks
from the bottle.

01:29:55.433 --> 01:29:57.161
They give you matches
when you buy cigars, you know.

01:29:57.234 --> 01:29:58.530
All you have to do is
ask for them.

01:29:58.602 --> 01:30:02.731
Don't like them, they always explode
in my pocket. So long, Walter.

01:30:07.075 --> 01:30:09.099
<i>(Walter)
I was scared stiff, Keyes.</i>

01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:12.242
<i>Maybe you were playing
cat-and-mouse with me.</i>

01:30:12.312 --> 01:30:15.474
<i>Maybe you knew all along
I was the somebody else.</i>

01:30:15.881 --> 01:30:20.078
<i>I had to find out, and I knew
where to look. In your office.</i>

01:30:52.644 --> 01:30:54.133
<i>(Keyes on dictation machine)
Memo to Mr. Norton.</i>

01:30:54.212 --> 01:30:55.872
<i>Confidential.
Dietrichson file.</i>

01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:59.443
<i>With regard to your proposal to put
Walter Neff under surveillance...</i>

01:30:59.516 --> 01:31:01.210
<i>I disagree absolutely.</i>

01:31:01.284 --> 01:31:03.649
<i>I have investigated his movements
on the night of the crime...</i>

01:31:03.719 --> 01:31:07.552
<i>and he's definitely placed in
his apartment from 7:15 p. m. On.</i>

01:31:08.156 --> 01:31:11.591
<i>In addition to this, I have known
Neff intimately for 11 years...</i>

01:31:11.659 --> 01:31:14.957
<i>and I personally vouch for him
without reservation.</i>

01:31:15.061 --> 01:31:16.049

01:31:19.598 --> 01:31:20.621
[Buzzing stops]

01:31:20.699 --> 01:31:23.599
<i>Furthermore, no connection
whatsoever has been established...</i>

01:31:23.668 --> 01:31:26.033
<i>between Walter Neff and
Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

01:31:26.103 --> 01:31:29.902
<i>whereas I am now able to report that
such a connection has been established...</i>

01:31:29.973 --> 01:31:32.099
<i>between her and another man.</i>

01:31:32.274 --> 01:31:35.140
<i>This man has been observed
to visit Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

01:31:35.210 --> 01:31:38.576
<i>on the nights of July 9th,
10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.</i>

01:31:39.314 --> 01:31:43.044
<i>We have succeeded in identifying
him as one Nino Zachetti...</i>

01:31:43.150 --> 01:31:45.640
<i>former medical student,
age of 28...</i>

01:31:45.719 --> 01:31:47.982
<i>residing at

<i>12281/2 North La Brea Avenue.</i>

<i>We have checked Zachetti's movements

01:31:55.025 --> 01:31:57.822
<i>and have found that
they cannot be accounted for.</i>

01:31:58.262 --> 01:32:01.492
<i>I am preparing a more detailed
report for your consideration.</i>

01:32:01.564 --> 01:32:05.260
<i>It is my belief that we already have
sufficient evidence against Zachetti...</i>

01:32:05.334 --> 01:32:08.393
<i>and Mrs. Dietrichson
to justify police action.</i>

01:32:08.669 --> 01:32:11.660
<i>I strongly urge that this whole
matter be turned over to the office...</i>

01:32:11.739 --> 01:32:13.672
<i>of the district attorney.</i>

01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:15.832
<i>Respectfully, Barton Keyes.</i>

01:32:19.545 --> 01:32:20.533
[Buzzing stops]

01:32:52.003 --> 01:32:55.733
Phyllis? It's Walter.
I've got to see you. Tonight.

01:32:57.174 --> 01:32:59.198
Yes, it has to be tonight.

01:32:59.809 --> 01:33:01.207
How's 11:00?

01:33:02.379 --> 01:33:04.175
Don't worry about Keyes.

01:33:04.246 --> 01:33:07.214
Just leave the front door
unlocked and put the lights out.

01:33:07.282 --> 01:33:10.216
No, nobody's watching
the house. Not anymore.

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:14.777
It's just for the neighbors. I
told you not to worry about Keyes.

01:33:15.856 --> 01:33:18.756
I'll see you at 11:00. Yeah.

01:33:20.559 --> 01:33:22.048
Goodbye, baby.

01:33:25.996 --> 01:33:27.724
<i>(Walter) I guess I
don't have to tell you...</i>

01:33:27.798 --> 01:33:30.459
<i>what I intended to do
at 11:00, Keyes.</i>

01:33:30.533 --> 01:33:34.093
<i>For the first time, I saw a way to
get clear of the whole mess I was in...</i>

01:33:34.170 --> 01:33:37.002
<i>and of Phyllis, too,
all at the same time.</i>

01:33:37.339 --> 01:33:39.465
<i>Yeah, that's what I thought.</i>

01:33:40.107 --> 01:33:43.473
<i>What I didn't know was that
she had plans of her own.</i>

01:34:25.876 --> 01:34:27.206
[Car approaching]

01:34:28.245 --> 01:34:29.233
[Car door closing]

01:34:42.957 --> 01:34:44.548
In here, Walter.

01:34:48.127 --> 01:34:49.991
<i>[Jazz music playing]</i>

01:34:59.403 --> 01:35:00.801
Hello, baby.

01:35:03.039 --> 01:35:05.734
Anybody else in the house?
Nobody. Why?

01:35:07.275 --> 01:35:10.175
What's that music?
A radio up the street.

01:35:18.685 --> 01:35:21.619
Just like the first time
I came here, isn't it?

01:35:21.687 --> 01:35:24.519
We were talking about
automobile insurance.

01:35:24.889 --> 01:35:27.413
Only you were thinking
about murder.

01:35:28.493 --> 01:35:30.392
I was thinking about
that anklet.

01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:32.324
And what are you
thinking about now?

01:35:32.395 --> 01:35:34.692
I'm all through thinking,
baby.

01:35:34.897 --> 01:35:37.160
I just came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?

01:35:37.399 --> 01:35:41.391
Where are you going? You're the
one that's going, baby. Not me.

01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:44.262
I'm getting off the trolley
car right at this corner.

01:35:44.338 --> 01:35:46.828
Suppose you stop being fancy.
Let's have it, whatever it is.

01:35:46.906 --> 01:35:50.341
All right, I'll tell you. A friend
of mine's got a funny theory.

01:35:50.743 --> 01:35:53.711
He says when two people commit a murder,
it's sort of like they're riding...

01:35:53.778 --> 01:35:56.405
on a trolley car together. One
can't get off without the other.

01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:58.777
They're stuck with each other
and they have to go on...

01:35:58.849 --> 01:36:01.146
riding together
clear to the end of the line.

01:36:01.217 --> 01:36:03.514
And the last stop
is the cemetery.

01:36:03.586 --> 01:36:06.748
Maybe he's got something
there. You bet he has.

01:36:06.855 --> 01:36:09.584
Two people are gonna ride to
the end of the line, all right.

01:36:09.657 --> 01:36:14.093
Only I'm not gonna be one of them. I've
got another guy to finish my ride for me.

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:17.617
Just who are you talking
about? An acquaintance of yours.

01:36:17.697 --> 01:36:19.027
A Mr. Zachetti.

01:36:19.098 --> 01:36:20.894
Come on, baby,
I just got into this thing...

01:36:20.966 --> 01:36:23.593
because I happen to know a little
something about insurance, didn't I?

01:36:23.668 --> 01:36:24.691
I was a sucker.

01:36:24.769 --> 01:36:27.532
I'd have been brushed off just as soon
as you got your hands on the money.

01:36:27.605 --> 01:36:30.266
Nobody wanted to brush you
off. Save it. I'm telling this.

01:36:30.707 --> 01:36:32.765
It's been you and that Zachetti
guy all along, hasn't it?

01:36:32.842 --> 01:36:34.433
That's not true.

01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:37.637
Doesn't make any difference
if it's true or not.

01:36:38.914 --> 01:36:42.405
The point is, Keyes believes Zachetti
is the one he's been looking for.

01:36:42.483 --> 01:36:45.542
He'll have him in that gas chamber
before he knows what's happened to him.

01:36:45.619 --> 01:36:48.985
What's happening to me all
this time? Don't be silly, baby.

01:36:54.259 --> 01:36:58.422
What do you think is gonna happen to you?
You helped him do the murder, didn't you?

01:36:58.496 --> 01:36:59.792
That's what Keyes thinks.

01:36:59.863 --> 01:37:02.126
And what's good enough for
Keyes is good enough for me.

01:37:02.198 --> 01:37:06.531
Maybe it's not good enough for me,
Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea.

01:37:06.602 --> 01:37:08.466
Maybe I'd rather talk.

01:37:08.604 --> 01:37:13.097
Sometimes people are where they can't
talk. Under six feet of dirt, maybe.

01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:17.466
And if it was you, they'd charge that
up to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?

01:37:17.544 --> 01:37:21.240
Sure they would, and that's
just what's gonna happen, baby.

01:37:21.681 --> 01:37:24.171
'Cause he's coming here
tonight, in about 15 minutes.

01:37:24.249 --> 01:37:27.706
With the cops right behind
him. It's all taken care of.

01:37:28.819 --> 01:37:31.082
That would make everything
lovely for you, wouldn't it?

01:37:31.155 --> 01:37:35.056
Right. And it's got to be done before
that suit of yours comes to trial...

01:37:35.124 --> 01:37:36.590
and Lola gets a chance
to sound off...

01:37:36.825 --> 01:37:39.884
before they trip you up on the stand, and
you start to go in drag me down with you.

01:37:39.962 --> 01:37:42.293
Maybe I had Zachetti here so they
won't get a chance to trip me up...

01:37:42.363 --> 01:37:43.795
so we can get the money
and be together.

01:37:44.198 --> 01:37:47.325
That's cute. Say it again. He came
here first to ask where Lola was.

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:49.458
I made him come back.
I was working on him.

01:37:49.536 --> 01:37:51.526
He's a crazy sort of guy,
quick-tempered.

01:37:51.604 --> 01:37:53.798
I kept hammering into him that
she was with another man...

01:37:53.872 --> 01:37:58.274
so he'd go into one of his jealous rages,
and then I'd tell him where she was.

01:37:58.343 --> 01:38:01.038
And you know what he would've
done to her, don't you, Walter?

01:38:01.111 --> 01:38:05.171
Yeah, and for once I believe you,
because it's just rotten enough.

01:38:06.048 --> 01:38:07.708
We're both rotten.

01:38:07.816 --> 01:38:09.476
Only you're
a little more rotten.

01:38:09.551 --> 01:38:11.643
You got me to take care
of your husband for you...

01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:15.246
and then you got Zachetti to take care
of Lola, maybe take care of me, too.

01:38:15.322 --> 01:38:18.381
Then somebody else would have come
along to take care of Zachetti for you.

01:38:18.458 --> 01:38:21.153
That's the way you operate,
isn't it, baby? Suppose it is.

01:38:21.227 --> 01:38:24.525
Is what you've got cooked up
for tonight any better?

01:38:25.364 --> 01:38:29.060
I don't like that music anymore.
Mind if I close the window?

01:38:44.811 --> 01:38:46.175
[Gun fires]

01:38:49.348 --> 01:38:52.282
You can do better than that,
can't you, baby?

01:38:52.518 --> 01:38:54.280
Better try it again.

01:38:57.055 --> 01:38:59.386
Maybe if I came
a little closer?

01:39:09.898 --> 01:39:12.388
How's this?
Think you can do it now?

01:39:21.407 --> 01:39:23.806
Why didn't you
shoot again, baby?

01:39:29.514 --> 01:39:33.472
Don't tell me it's because you've
been in love with me all this time.

01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:37.007
No, I never loved you, Walter,
not you or anybody else.

01:39:37.253 --> 01:39:40.483
I'm rotten to the heart.
I used you, just as you said.

01:39:40.555 --> 01:39:42.988
That's all you
ever meant to me...

01:39:44.158 --> 01:39:45.886
until a minute ago...

01:39:47.027 --> 01:39:49.654
when I couldn't fire
that second shot.

01:39:51.264 --> 01:39:53.993
I never thought
that could happen to me.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.559
Sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
I'm not asking you to buy.

01:39:57.635 --> 01:39:59.363
Just hold me close.

01:40:05.809 --> 01:40:07.298
Goodbye, baby.

01:40:07.476 --> 01:40:09.238
[Gun fires twice]

01:41:01.918 --> 01:41:03.179
Zachetti.

01:41:05.354 --> 01:41:06.684
Come here.

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:14.220
I said, come here.

01:41:16.964 --> 01:41:19.989
My name is Neff. Yeah,
and I still don't like it.

01:41:20.066 --> 01:41:21.692
What do you want?

01:41:21.768 --> 01:41:23.064
Look, kid.

01:41:24.236 --> 01:41:27.500
I want to give you a present.
This nice new nickel.

01:41:27.672 --> 01:41:29.730
What's the gag? Suppose you
go on back down the hill...

01:41:29.807 --> 01:41:31.398
to the drugstore
and make a phone call.

01:41:31.475 --> 01:41:33.567
Keep your nickel and buy
yourself an ice-cream cone.

01:41:33.643 --> 01:41:35.405
The number is Granite-0-3-8-6.

01:41:35.478 --> 01:41:38.037
Ask for Miss Dietrichson.
First name is Lola.

01:41:38.113 --> 01:41:39.204
She isn't worth a nickel.

01:41:39.281 --> 01:41:41.771
If I ever talk to her, it's not
going to be over any telephone.

01:41:41.849 --> 01:41:42.872
Tough, aren't you?

01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:44.974
Here, take the nickel and
call her. She wants you to.

01:41:45.052 --> 01:41:46.814
She doesn't want
any part of me.

01:41:47.087 --> 01:41:49.646
I know who told you that.
It's not true.

01:41:49.723 --> 01:41:52.247
Lola's in love with you.
She always has been.

01:41:52.324 --> 01:41:54.553
Don't ask me why.
I couldn't even guess.

01:41:54.627 --> 01:41:57.891
Here. Granite-0-3-8-6.
Now go on and call her.

01:41:58.563 --> 01:42:00.154
Go on. That way.

01:42:10.405 --> 01:42:12.565
(Walter)
It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.

01:42:13.941 --> 01:42:14.998
It's cold.

01:42:17.077 --> 01:42:20.671
I wonder if she's still lying
alone up there in that house...

01:42:20.747 --> 01:42:22.873
or if they've found her
by now.

01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:27.848
I wonder a lot of things.
They don't matter anymore.

01:42:28.853 --> 01:42:30.319
[Coughing]

01:42:32.122 --> 01:42:35.113
Except I want you to do
a favor for me, Keyes.

01:42:35.992 --> 01:42:40.927
I want you to be the one to tell Lola,
kind of gently, before it breaks wide open.

01:42:42.597 --> 01:42:46.293
And I want you to take care
of her and that guy Zachetti...

01:42:50.903 --> 01:42:53.700
so he doesn't get
pushed around too much.

01:42:55.674 --> 01:42:57.140
Hello, Keyes.

01:43:07.083 --> 01:43:09.209
Up pretty early, aren't you?

01:43:10.652 --> 01:43:13.984
I always wondered what time
you got down to the office.

01:43:14.722 --> 01:43:17.884
Or did that little man of
yours pull you out of bed?

01:43:17.958 --> 01:43:19.549
The janitor did.

01:43:20.393 --> 01:43:23.020
Seems you leaked a little
blood on the way in here.

01:43:23.095 --> 01:43:24.186
Yeah.

01:43:24.663 --> 01:43:26.527
Wouldn't be surprised.

01:43:27.966 --> 01:43:31.526
I wanted to straighten you out
on that Dietrichson case.

01:43:31.902 --> 01:43:33.300
So I gather.

01:43:34.972 --> 01:43:38.338
How long have you been
standing there? Long enough.

01:43:38.407 --> 01:43:41.398
Kind of a crazy story
with a crazy twist to it.

01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:44.300
One you didn't
quite figure out.

01:43:44.378 --> 01:43:46.811
You can't figure them all,
Walter.

01:43:47.448 --> 01:43:50.177
That's right.
I guess you can't at that.

01:43:51.451 --> 01:43:54.044
Now I suppose
I get the big speech...

01:43:55.087 --> 01:43:58.021
the one with all the
two-dollar words in it.

01:43:59.223 --> 01:44:01.019
Let's have it, Keyes.

01:44:02.392 --> 01:44:05.588
Walter, you're all washed up.

01:44:08.197 --> 01:44:10.721
Thanks, Keyes.
That was short anyway.

01:44:12.066 --> 01:44:14.192
I'm gonna call for a doctor.

01:44:16.403 --> 01:44:19.030
What for?
So they can patch me up?

01:44:20.107 --> 01:44:22.768
So they can nurse me along
till I get back on my feet?

01:44:22.842 --> 01:44:26.242
So I can walk into that gas chamber
up at San Quentin on my own power?

01:44:26.311 --> 01:44:27.902
Is that it, Keyes?

01:44:27.979 --> 01:44:29.639
Something like that.

01:44:30.614 --> 01:44:32.911
I've got a different idea.
Yeah?

01:44:32.983 --> 01:44:34.347
Look, Keyes.

01:44:34.717 --> 01:44:37.116
Suppose you went back to bed and
didn't find these cylinders...

01:44:37.186 --> 01:44:39.551
till tomorrow morning,
when the office opens...

01:44:39.621 --> 01:44:42.214
After that you can
play it any way you like.

01:44:42.291 --> 01:44:44.884
Would you do
that much for me, Keyes?

01:44:45.159 --> 01:44:49.094
Give me one good reason. I need
four hours to get where I'm going.

01:44:49.162 --> 01:44:52.358
You're not going anywhere,
Walter. You bet I am.

01:44:53.265 --> 01:44:56.165
I'm going across the border.
You haven't got a chance, Walter.

01:44:56.235 --> 01:44:57.792
Good enough to try for.

01:44:57.869 --> 01:45:01.304
You'll never make the border.
That's what you think.

01:45:02.005 --> 01:45:03.494
Just watch me.

01:45:03.941 --> 01:45:06.101
You'll never even make
the elevator.

01:45:06.342 --> 01:45:07.330
So long, Keyes.

01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:31.154
[Phone dialing]

01:45:36.967 --> 01:45:38.263
(Keyes)
Hello...

01:45:38.334 --> 01:45:40.961
send an ambulance to the
Pacific Building on Olive Street.

01:45:43.171 --> 01:45:45.138
Yeah. It's a police job.

01:46:04.955 --> 01:46:07.514
How you doing, Walter?
Fine.

01:46:09.758 --> 01:46:13.284
Only somebody moved the
elevator a couple of miles away.

01:46:13.862 --> 01:46:15.590
They're on the way.

01:46:19.933 --> 01:46:22.560
You know why you couldn't
figure this one, Keyes?

01:46:22.635 --> 01:46:24.124

01:46:33.744 --> 01:46:35.108

01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:38.503
I love you, too.
