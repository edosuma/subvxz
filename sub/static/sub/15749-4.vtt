00:01.583 --> 00:03.863
I just want a chance to make it up
to you and George.

00:03.903 --> 00:06.103
I don't remember you
ever being sober.

00:07.863 --> 00:09.863
Lost a bit of money. My money.

00:09.965 --> 00:12.485
It's a fine thing that Ellen Love
drops into the store.

00:12.525 --> 00:14.125
She encourages people to buy.

00:14.165 --> 00:16.565
Maintain a professional
relationship with her.

00:16.605 --> 00:20.245
Buying up the store on his credit.
People are talking.

00:20.285 --> 00:22.885
He's installed Miss Love in a flat.

00:22.925 --> 00:25.725
I'm Roderick Temple, I'm a painter.
Why don't you paint me?

00:25.765 --> 00:28.285
But I thought we were having lunch.
Not today.

00:45.125 --> 00:47.125
I hope you're wrong, Mr Grove.

00:48.285 --> 00:50.285
Miss Bunting, a moment.

00:53.645 --> 00:55.645
Miss Mardle, your assistance,
please.

00:55.685 --> 00:58.885
Is something wrong, Mr Grove?
Mr Selfridge?

01:01.285 --> 01:05.405
Miss Mardle, the hem of
Miss Bunting's skirts, please.

01:18.565 --> 01:20.565
Please say it isn't true.

01:32.045 --> 01:35.045
Miss Bunting,
this is our best lace and silk.

01:36.245 --> 01:38.765
I'm so sorry, Mr Selfridge.

01:39.925 --> 01:41.925
Consider that sorry and fired.

01:41.965 --> 01:44.965
I-I-I was going to pay for
everything, just as soon as my -

01:45.005 --> 01:47.805
You were one of the first people
that I hired.

01:49.005 --> 01:51.325
You don't steal from your work
family.

01:51.365 --> 01:54.685
It's a betrayal of everything
that we stand for.

01:54.725 --> 01:57.925
Don't you see that? Don't you see
that? Yes.

01:57.965 --> 01:59.565
I...

01:59.605 --> 02:03.165
Increase random checks of all
departments, starting tomorrow.

02:03.205 --> 02:05.205
I hate this. I hate it!

02:06.245 --> 02:09.645
I-I'm all on my own with an invalid
mother, Mr Grove.

02:09.685 --> 02:13.365
How am I to get another position,
without a reference?

02:14.685 --> 02:18.085
Mr Selfridge takes theft very
personally, Miss Bunting.

02:19.325 --> 02:22.445
He also takes staff problems very
personally.

02:22.485 --> 02:25.445
Why on earth didn't you come to us?

02:28.245 --> 02:30.765
I was too ashamed, Mr Grove.

02:36.565 --> 02:38.565
Collect your things.

02:52.365 --> 02:55.485
If you could get back to me...
Yes, that would be kind.

02:55.525 --> 02:57.525
Yes, indeed.

02:59.165 --> 03:01.885
Another hand-delivered card from
Miss Love, sir.

03:01.925 --> 03:04.685
Make some time for Mr Grove to see
me, tomorrow.

03:04.725 --> 03:07.845
We need to see about a replacement
for Miss Bunting.

03:07.885 --> 03:11.085
Miss Bunting's being replaced?
Anyone can be replaced.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.125
Good night, Miss Blenkinsop.

<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

03:57.765 --> 04:00.245
Smells nice. Yeah, it looks nice.

04:03.845 --> 04:06.445
Could you butter me a little bit of
bread? Yeah.

04:13.565 --> 04:15.565
Aggie?

04:16.725 --> 04:19.845
Mrs Payne must have left the front
door open. Agnes, come on, girl.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.805
Well, he can't get in, can he?
The locks have been changed.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.845
Hello?

04:26.925 --> 04:29.405
Agnes, you can't do this. We're a
family.

04:31.165 --> 04:33.165
I'm out on the streets.

04:33.205 --> 04:35.405
I don't have two brass farthings.

04:35.445 --> 04:37.765
Hey, eat it up, George, while it's
hot. Agnes?

04:37.805 --> 04:39.805
I need to talk to you.

04:44.205 --> 04:46.765
Agnes, open the door!

04:48.445 --> 04:51.845
George, are you in there?
George, it's all right.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.125
Agnes, I'm warning you.

04:55.165 --> 04:57.165
Open the door!

04:57.205 --> 04:59.205
This mutton's lovely.

04:59.245 --> 05:02.045
And the dumplings turned out well.

05:02.085 --> 05:04.525
Agnes!

05:04.565 --> 05:07.485
See that the car is waiting for us,
Fraser, thank you.

05:22.165 --> 05:25.205
Pa! Where are we going, anyway?
What's the big secret?

06:57.725 --> 07:00.005
Pavlova so close I could touch her.

07:01.205 --> 07:03.605
Thank you, Harry. A true gift.

07:06.125 --> 07:08.605
Bravo. Bravo. Bravo.

07:09.645 --> 07:11.245
Bravo.

07:13.325 --> 07:15.005
Woo!

07:16.765 --> 07:18.765
Oh, Frank.

07:22.005 --> 07:24.245
Her performance was so beautiful.

07:24.285 --> 07:26.485
She was so enchanting.

07:26.525 --> 07:29.765
I did cry. Did you? Yes.

07:29.805 --> 07:33.085
Beatrice would have loved this.
I wish she could've been here.

07:33.125 --> 07:36.165
How beautiful you look tonight, my
dear.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.805
Thank you, Lady Loxley.

07:37.845 --> 07:40.645
I've never seen Rosalie at such a
loss for words.

07:40.685 --> 07:42.685
Rosalie. Pa!

07:44.925 --> 07:47.685
I like the young - fresh and
untainted,

07:47.725 --> 07:49.965
before the world gets hold of them.

07:50.005 --> 07:53.605
But I suspect Rosalie will be safe
from that corruption,

07:53.645 --> 07:55.445
you'll see to that.

07:55.485 --> 07:58.445
Mr Selfridge, have we won you over
to the charms of the ballet?

07:58.485 --> 08:01.565
The look on my wife's face would've
won me over to anything.

08:01.605 --> 08:04.885
I've never seen you so enchanted.

08:04.925 --> 08:06.925
What struck you so?

08:08.165 --> 08:13.405
I don't know. Well, it was like a
moment of perfect beauty,

08:13.445 --> 08:15.845
where everything
just came together.

08:15.885 --> 08:19.685
I just wish everyone could enjoy
this.

08:19.725 --> 08:23.605
You are an idealist, my dear Mrs
Selfridge.

08:23.645 --> 08:27.725
Only the very select can enjoy such
a gift. No, I disagree.

08:27.765 --> 08:30.965
I think every woman should have
a Pavlova moment, like this.

08:31.005 --> 08:33.445
Ladies and gentlemen,
Madame Pavlova.

08:33.485 --> 08:35.485
There she is.

08:38.725 --> 08:40.325
My dear...

08:43.125 --> 08:46.325
Bravo, Miss Pavlova, you were truly
amazing.

08:46.365 --> 08:49.325
We Americans like to show our
enthusiasm, freely.

08:49.365 --> 08:51.805
Stunning, beyond words. You are too
kind.

08:53.045 --> 08:55.885
Thank you for coming so swiftly,
Frank.

08:55.925 --> 08:58.525
A girl likes to know that she can
still summon a gentleman

08:58.565 --> 09:00.165
at the click of her fingers.

09:00.205 --> 09:02.485
Not even a click, Miss Love, not
even that.

09:06.325 --> 09:09.285
So... do you have plans after the
show? Huh?

09:09.325 --> 09:11.565
I thought, perhaps, you and I...

09:11.605 --> 09:14.405
I want you to find out what's going
on with Harry. Oh.

09:14.445 --> 09:16.445
What do you mean?

09:16.485 --> 09:19.045
He doesn't come near me.

09:19.085 --> 09:21.485
He won't take my telephone calls.

09:21.525 --> 09:23.325
He doesn't respond to my notes.

09:23.365 --> 09:25.405
Is there anything I need to know,
Frank?

09:25.445 --> 09:27.125
Not that I'm aware of, Ellen, dear.

09:27.165 --> 09:28.965
You know Harry, he's his own man.

09:29.005 --> 09:30.725
He's my man.

09:30.765 --> 09:32.765
Look.

09:34.005 --> 09:36.245
Look at the things he's given me.

09:37.245 --> 09:40.685
Anything. 'Anything I want,'
that's what he said.

09:40.725 --> 09:42.725
Well, he's a very generous chap.

09:42.765 --> 09:45.565
Generous? Are you blind?

09:45.605 --> 09:47.605
Have you seen my apartment?

09:47.645 --> 09:49.885
The best of everything.

09:49.925 --> 09:54.485
That's not generosity, that's -
that's a man putting down roots.

09:54.525 --> 09:56.125
Roots?

09:56.165 --> 09:58.165
Ellen, I hope you're not...

09:58.205 --> 09:59.925
Surely you don't think...

09:59.965 --> 10:01.965
Why not?

10:02.005 --> 10:04.005
Lady Loxley was a Gaiety girl.

10:04.045 --> 10:06.445
She nabbed Lord Loxley.

10:06.485 --> 10:09.885
I'm sure that Harry has the same
intentions for me.

10:11.405 --> 10:14.445
He... just needs reminding, that's
all.

10:16.805 --> 10:18.805
That's all.

10:18.845 --> 10:20.845
Just reminding.

10:24.045 --> 10:25.805
Mm.

10:25.845 --> 10:28.085
Look. Oh, my dear girl.

10:55.485 --> 10:58.165
You didn't slide down, you fell
right off the horse.

10:58.205 --> 11:00.885
Actually, it was more of a pony, a
small pony.

11:00.925 --> 11:04.365
You're such a liar, Violette.
It was huge. I didn't fall.

11:04.405 --> 11:07.125
I thrashed you - Gordon, Violette,
enough!

11:08.125 --> 11:11.565
Beatrice, please, poppet. Just a
little more egg.

11:11.605 --> 11:13.845
Rosalie isn't telling enough.

11:13.885 --> 11:16.565
You do know I'm going to be a
ballerina, don't you?

11:16.605 --> 11:19.565
I thought you were going to be in
variety shows, like Ellen Love?

11:19.605 --> 11:22.805
Couldn't I do both? You could do
anything you set your mind to.

11:22.845 --> 11:26.045
Come on, she's a girl. Who beat you
at arm wrestling the last 10 times?

11:26.085 --> 11:28.365
You two!
Can I please eat my breakfast?

11:28.405 --> 11:30.005
Good morning. Mama!

11:30.045 --> 11:31.845
Mama, was she beautiful?

11:31.885 --> 11:34.085
Did you cry? Yes and yes.

11:34.125 --> 11:37.325
Rosalie, didn't you tell
your sister all about Pavlova?

11:37.365 --> 11:41.725
How do you explain female
perfection to an over-eager puppy?

11:42.885 --> 11:45.285
Well, all puppies have to learn, I
suppose.

11:45.325 --> 11:48.645
Best they don't pick up bad habits
from the beginning, though,

11:48.685 --> 11:50.685
hey, Rosalie?

11:50.725 --> 11:53.125
I should die if I could meet Anna
Pavlova.

11:53.165 --> 11:56.765
I might have to cancel a certain
arrangement, then. What a shame.

11:56.805 --> 12:00.765
You don't mean - I could mean
something. I could mean nothing.

12:00.805 --> 12:04.445
Oh, Papa,
40 kisses every day for a week.

12:04.485 --> 12:07.165
20 in the morning,
and 20 before bed.

12:08.285 --> 12:10.285
Impressive arithmetic.

12:10.325 --> 12:13.605
I tell you what, you make it
50 kisses and you've got a deal.

12:15.205 --> 12:17.605
Good morning, everyone.
Morning. Good morning.

12:17.645 --> 12:19.605
She'll be coming to the store
tomorrow

12:19.645 --> 12:22.005
and you'll all get a chance to meet
her.

12:22.045 --> 12:25.365
You, dear Rose, will have afternoon
tea with her.

12:25.405 --> 12:27.405
Oh, my! Who loves me?

12:27.445 --> 12:29.445
Who the heck in this room loves me?

12:29.485 --> 12:31.605
We do.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.005
Neaten the brooches.

13:38.005 --> 13:40.485
I'd like to see your best inset
collars, please.

13:40.525 --> 13:43.325
Finest gauze with a pearl motif,
preferably.

13:45.045 --> 13:46.765
We're not open yet, madam.

13:46.805 --> 13:50.885
I'm not a client, or I wouldn't be
here before doors opening.

13:50.925 --> 13:53.765
White and a silvery grey, if you
please.

13:55.645 --> 13:57.245
What do you want them for, madam?

13:57.285 --> 13:59.565
For the decolletage on the
mannequins, of course.

13:59.605 --> 14:02.125
You have to check with Miss Mardle,
Head of Accessories.

14:02.165 --> 14:05.085
I will, send her to me. Now,
collars, please.

14:21.445 --> 14:23.445
Did you see that, Doris?

14:23.485 --> 14:25.805
Her skirts are around her ankles.

15:05.685 --> 15:07.685
That motor van you're loading...

15:07.725 --> 15:10.125
I don't see the Selfridges livery
on the side.

15:11.845 --> 15:14.725
How often does it come? Mornings,
sometimes.

15:15.765 --> 15:17.765
It'll be back around three, today.

15:17.805 --> 15:20.925
It's always you that loads it?
I do what Alf and Sam tell me.

15:21.925 --> 15:24.125
What are you getting out of it? Eh?

15:25.325 --> 15:27.325
My wage, of course.

15:27.365 --> 15:29.365
What else should I be getting?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.685
Miss Irene Ravillious.

15:39.725 --> 15:42.685
London-trained at
the House of Lucile, no less.

15:42.725 --> 15:44.925
Our new visionary Head of Fashion.

15:44.965 --> 15:48.085
Liberty's loss
is very much our gain.

15:50.445 --> 15:52.965
She'll breathe new life into our
fashion department.

15:53.005 --> 15:55.005
Isn't that right, Miss Ravillious?
Well -

15:55.007 --> 15:56.807
In fact, she's so confident,

15:56.847 --> 16:00.447
that women's fashion might even
surpass accessories one day.

16:01.487 --> 16:04.167
Are you asking me, or telling me,
Mr Selfridge?

16:06.207 --> 16:09.327
A little bit of both, I guess.
That would be acceptable.

16:09.367 --> 16:13.287
So I'd even go so far as to predict
that, within my lifetime certainly,

16:13.327 --> 16:16.327
it won't just be the men who can
purchase ready-made for purpose,

16:16.367 --> 16:18.367
but also the ladies.

16:18.407 --> 16:20.407
What do you mean?

16:20.447 --> 16:25.007
A lady shall enter our store,
see a costume, say, 'I want that,'

16:25.047 --> 16:26.647
and purchase the very day.

16:26.687 --> 16:29.927
No fittings, no seamstress,
no waiting about.

16:29.967 --> 16:33.567
All well and good, Miss Ravillious,
but surely ladies tend to...

16:35.447 --> 16:37.047
..tend to...

16:38.047 --> 16:41.447
..tend to...
Tend to what, Mr Crabb?

16:43.007 --> 16:46.047
Shapes and sizes, Mr Selfridge.

16:46.087 --> 16:48.367
Precisely the point, Mr Crabb.

16:48.407 --> 16:51.127
We shall stock all shapes and sizes.

16:51.167 --> 16:53.167
Fashion will be big one day.

16:53.207 --> 16:55.527
Mark my words, it's just a matter of
time.

16:56.647 --> 16:59.287
Meanwhile, I have a great event
planned.

16:59.327 --> 17:01.447
Anna Pavlova, any of you heard of
her?

17:01.487 --> 17:03.287
Indeed. Yes.

17:03.327 --> 17:05.567
She will be on our shop floor.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.727
Surely not? Yes, Miss Mardle.

17:07.767 --> 17:11.166
The beautiful and unique Pavlova
will be on our store floor,

17:11.207 --> 17:14.487
for all to share -
from a Duchess to a lady's maid.

17:14.527 --> 17:16.807
An experience
they'll always remember.

17:16.847 --> 17:19.527
She'll mingle, Mr Selfridge?
You bet she'll mingle.

17:19.567 --> 17:21.567
I'm gonna pay her handsomely,
I might add.

17:21.607 --> 17:24.367
Every woman should have a Pavlova
moment.

17:25.406 --> 17:28.287
Meeting adjourned. Back to
your posts with vim and vigour.

17:28.327 --> 17:30.327
Thank you all.

17:32.487 --> 17:35.847
I can't help but notice that your
skirt is shorter than the usual.

17:35.887 --> 17:37.487
Is this the coming fashion?

17:37.527 --> 17:41.527
My skirts are shorter because I'm a
champion of the Rational Dress
Movement. The what?

17:41.567 --> 17:44.967
I believe clothes can serve a
purpose other than mere drapery.

17:45.007 --> 17:46.607
I use my bicycle to get about,

17:46.647 --> 17:49.247
consequently my skirts hang an inch
or two above the norm.

17:49.287 --> 17:52.167
And I don't bother with whalebone
corseting - too restricting.

17:52.207 --> 17:54.887
Vigorous exercise is sufficient to
keep my figure intact.

17:54.927 --> 17:58.167
You are entitled to your ways, of
course, Miss Ravillious,

17:58.207 --> 18:00.367
but may I advise you on our way in
the store,

18:00.407 --> 18:03.327
with regard to taking stock from
one department for another -

18:03.367 --> 18:07.207
Thank you, but I use my initiative,
as the staff manual decrees.

18:18.927 --> 18:20.927
Day's not ripe, don't mind if I do.

18:22.047 --> 18:24.127
I'm an upside-down creature, Frank.

18:25.167 --> 18:27.167
Day's my night, night's my day.

18:27.207 --> 18:30.207
You're a delectable, upside-down
creature. Cheers.

18:32.687 --> 18:34.687
I take it you've spoken to Harry?

18:34.727 --> 18:36.887
Is he coming to see me, today?

18:36.927 --> 18:38.927
I shouldn't think today.

18:40.607 --> 18:42.367
He's gonna be very busy.

18:43.407 --> 18:45.887
Oh, no, red stuff's my poison.
Thanks all the same.

18:45.927 --> 18:48.727
Why today in particular, Frank?

18:51.367 --> 18:52.967
Who is she?

18:54.087 --> 18:57.007
Who? Who, Frank? I'm sure it's just
business.

18:57.047 --> 18:59.047
That's why we press...

19:00.087 --> 19:02.487
Anna Pavlova is
visiting Selfridges, today.

19:02.527 --> 19:04.527
THE Anna Pavlova?

19:07.087 --> 19:08.847
I see.

19:08.887 --> 19:11.407
My dear, you know what men like
Selfridge are like.

19:11.447 --> 19:14.127
He's always in hot pursuit of the
next big thing.

19:14.167 --> 19:17.207
Take my advice
and leave well alone.

19:17.247 --> 19:19.967
She'll be gone like a puff of air
and I'm sure he'll be -

19:20.007 --> 19:22.327
I am the Spirit of Selfridges,
Frank. Ellen -

19:22.367 --> 19:24.287
How can I not be there to welcome
Pavlova?

19:24.327 --> 19:27.167
I have to be there. Oh!

19:27.207 --> 19:29.207
Just go, Frank!

19:33.727 --> 19:35.727
How much longer?

19:35.767 --> 19:37.927
I'm about to drop off.

19:42.367 --> 19:44.487
Just hold the pose, just another
while.

19:56.647 --> 19:58.247
I get the message.

19:58.287 --> 20:01.007
I'm being greedy. That's enough for
today.

20:07.887 --> 20:09.847
You know, it's such a rare quality,

20:09.887 --> 20:12.567
a woman so comfortable in her own
skin.

20:12.607 --> 20:14.847
I'm American, maybe that's it.

20:16.687 --> 20:18.687
No.

20:18.727 --> 20:20.727
No, that's not it.

20:28.287 --> 20:30.087
So when I can see - Ah-ah-ah!

20:30.127 --> 20:32.727
When it's ready for showing at the
Chelsea Arts Club.

20:32.767 --> 20:35.167
I was hoping to buy it as a gift
for my husband.

20:40.727 --> 20:43.367
Come with me to the club, Rose.
You'd love it there.

20:43.407 --> 20:46.647
There are some amazing paintings.
Now? No, no, I can't.

20:46.687 --> 20:50.127
Some amazing paintings -
No, really, I can't.

20:50.167 --> 20:52.167
We'll take our entrance from here.

20:52.207 --> 20:54.887
We will have a great deal of press
in this area.

20:56.087 --> 20:57.887
Have as many people gathered here,

20:57.927 --> 21:01.127
just beyond a roped off area,
right here.

21:03.087 --> 21:06.407
- All set for Pavlova's arrival?
- Yes, Mr Selfridge.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.367
Miss Ravillious? Yes, Mr Selfridge?

21:09.407 --> 21:12.527
We must make the most of her
presence. Sales-wise, you mean?

21:12.567 --> 21:15.527
So it's not just about giving women
a moment to remember?

21:15.567 --> 21:18.247
Business is about giving people what
they want.

21:18.287 --> 21:22.687
That's what keeps over 2,000 staff
employed.

21:22.727 --> 21:26.367
The more people purchase, the more
memories. Simple commerce.

21:26.407 --> 21:28.487
I am open to all of
your suggestions.

21:28.527 --> 21:31.047
Please feel free to use your
imaginations

21:31.087 --> 21:34.007
and both departments working
together.

21:35.087 --> 21:37.687
I welcome all of your ideas as soon
as possible.

21:37.727 --> 21:39.727
Thank you very much.

21:47.967 --> 21:52.207
Don't give Miss Ravillious anything
from accessories, unless I say so.

21:52.247 --> 21:55.527
Is that understood? Yes, Miss
Mardle. Sorry, Miss Mardle.

21:55.567 --> 21:58.247
Now, you heard Mr Selfridge,
any ideas, ladies,

21:58.287 --> 22:01.767
before Miss Ravillious gets in
there first and shows us up...

22:05.567 --> 22:07.567
Great idea, Miss Ravillious.

22:07.607 --> 22:11.327
All we have to do is add the white
braiding to our existing capes.

22:12.367 --> 22:14.527
See? How quickly can this be done?

22:14.567 --> 22:17.367
I'll get the seamstresses to do
what they can today

22:17.407 --> 22:20.567
then, if they sell, we can put them
on shifts through the night

22:20.607 --> 22:22.727
to be ready for tomorrow.
Excellent.

22:22.767 --> 22:26.567
Good idea. Have my wife's initials
sewn into the cape.

22:26.607 --> 22:29.087
I cannot wait to see her face.

22:35.727 --> 22:37.727
Come.

22:41.687 --> 22:44.967
I got them, Roger,
those tickets for Drury Lane.

22:46.447 --> 22:48.447
Oh.

22:48.487 --> 22:50.807
Josie, I'm so sorry.

22:51.927 --> 22:54.127
Oh, no. Please don't say you can't
come.

22:54.167 --> 22:57.287
Hettie's nurse asked for the night
off. I completely forgot.

22:57.327 --> 23:00.487
Let me pay for them. Take a friend
instead.

23:00.527 --> 23:02.527
It was my treat.

23:02.567 --> 23:04.567
Another time, perhaps.

23:06.407 --> 23:08.407
Oh, and while I'm here,

23:08.447 --> 23:12.207
Miss Ravillious needs to know she
can't pinch from other departments.

23:12.247 --> 23:14.447
You may find that

23:14.487 --> 23:17.407
she is looking for white braiding
from accessories.

23:17.447 --> 23:20.087
An idea she's putting to Mr
Selfridge as we speak.

23:20.127 --> 23:23.567
From my department? And she didn't
ask me to go and see him with her?

23:30.727 --> 23:33.487
It even goes with that, I think.
Mm-hm.

23:39.767 --> 23:41.567
Victor?

23:45.687 --> 23:49.487
Your George - you might wanna ask
him about the vans he loads.

23:49.527 --> 23:51.967
Well, how do you mean?
Well, just that.

23:52.007 --> 23:54.367
Just check
he knows what he's doing, is all.

23:54.407 --> 23:56.407
What do we think, Miss Towler?

23:56.447 --> 23:59.007
Which ribbon for rose buds? Hm?

24:00.847 --> 24:02.967
White, Mr Leclair. I agree.

24:03.007 --> 24:05.767
Thank you, girls.
You're welcome, Mr Leclair.

24:05.807 --> 24:07.807
Can we make a start?

24:10.607 --> 24:12.607
Yes, Mr Leclair. Good.

24:14.487 --> 24:16.327
Miss Mardle, with your permission,

24:16.367 --> 24:19.727
I'd like to move Miss Towler to the
fashion department for today.

24:19.767 --> 24:22.887
By all means, Mr Leclair. Move all
of accessories, why don't you?

24:22.927 --> 24:25.807
It's the way things are heading,
as far as I can see.

24:25.847 --> 24:27.847
Only Miss Towler. Thank you.

24:31.847 --> 24:33.847
Why not one of us?

24:34.887 --> 24:37.607
She's no better than you or me. Hm.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.367
Sometimes, I think I'll turn into a
boring chicken.

24:49.407 --> 24:51.287
Cluck-cluck.

24:51.327 --> 24:53.727
Wouldn't that be amusing, Mr
Colleano?

24:53.767 --> 24:55.927
Let me add some flavour, Lady
Loxley.

24:58.207 --> 25:00.207
Something original.

25:00.247 --> 25:02.247
Of course, Lady Loxley.

25:04.527 --> 25:07.407
Ah, Lady Mae, always a pleasure to
see you.

25:07.447 --> 25:10.607
Quite a coup you've pulled off, Mr
Selfridge.

25:10.647 --> 25:12.647
Pavlova in a shop.

25:12.687 --> 25:14.687
This shop.

25:14.727 --> 25:18.847
Actually, she's having tea with Rose
at 3:30, if you wanna join them.

25:18.887 --> 25:20.487
I certainly would.

25:20.527 --> 25:23.247
Your wife's company grows on me
with each encounter.

25:23.287 --> 25:25.487
Me too.

25:27.567 --> 25:30.167
How dare you speak about my beloved
Rossetti like that.

25:30.207 --> 25:31.967
His paintings make me swoon.

25:32.007 --> 25:34.967
Because they're overblown,
sentimental tosh. Here, here.

25:36.167 --> 25:38.287
Do I get a kiss every time you
disagree with me?

25:38.327 --> 25:40.007
Come on, Cora, kiss him.

25:40.047 --> 25:42.927
Mrs Buckingham, is your husband a
patron of the arts also?

25:42.967 --> 25:44.887
In a manner of speaking, yes.

25:44.927 --> 25:48.407
Buckingham? Buckingham?

25:48.447 --> 25:52.887
I can't say I know any other
American involved in that circle.

25:52.927 --> 25:54.927
Anyone else?

25:54.967 --> 25:57.887
The Buckinghams, they're relatively
new to London.

25:57.927 --> 26:00.567
I'm so sorry, I really am running
rather late.

26:00.607 --> 26:02.207
Oh!

26:02.247 --> 26:05.927
But thank you so much. I'm sorry,
but I'm so late -

26:05.967 --> 26:07.807
Tell us everything.

26:07.847 --> 26:11.047
Has your husband commissioned
paintings of you before? Tell us.

26:14.847 --> 26:18.847
Victor, what do you think you're
playing at?

26:18.887 --> 26:20.887
Satisfying the lady, Mr Perez.

26:27.287 --> 26:30.007
Gentleman's relish and a typical
Italian touch.

26:30.047 --> 26:32.247
Chopped olives and capers. Mm.

26:40.767 --> 26:43.447
You have an inspired touch, Mr
Colleano.

26:43.487 --> 26:45.567
I look forward to tasting more from
you.

26:45.607 --> 26:47.447
Any time you say, Lady Loxley.

26:47.487 --> 26:49.687
I say in a couple of hours,
Mr Colleano.

26:52.967 --> 26:56.607
Do let me know when Mrs Selfridge
arrives, I'm taking tea with her...

26:57.767 --> 27:00.287
..which sadly means I shall have to
reserve my appetite

27:00.327 --> 27:02.447
for any more of your creative
touches.

27:09.767 --> 27:12.367
Still, the pleasure is in the
anticipation.

27:13.567 --> 27:16.367
Don't you think? I can't rightly
say, Lady Loxley.

27:16.407 --> 27:18.407
I like to eat when I'm hungry.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.527
Welcome.

27:37.607 --> 27:40.287
Beautiful. Good to see you.
Thank you, Mr Selfridge.

27:40.327 --> 27:42.327
Gentlemen...

28:17.596 --> 28:19.916
Such beautiful emeralds.

28:19.956 --> 28:22.276
The finest, madam, from Columbia,

28:22.343 --> 28:26.263
mounted on white gold and fashioned
by our designers in Hatton Garden.

28:26.303 --> 28:28.303
Ooh!

28:28.343 --> 28:33.263
A child in a confectionery store is
what you make of me, Mr Selfridge.

28:33.303 --> 28:35.423
I like to spoil ladies,
Miss Pavlova.

28:35.463 --> 28:39.543
Your presence and pleasure suit the
image we want to convey.

28:41.543 --> 28:46.263
So how shall we transport all these
perfumes, lotions and petticoats?

28:46.303 --> 28:48.303
Do we have enough items of luggage?

28:51.213 --> 28:53.213
Spasibo.

28:56.733 --> 28:58.733
Oh!

28:58.773 --> 29:01.133
Ladies fashion, perhaps?

29:01.173 --> 29:03.173
Oh, yes, please.

29:13.013 --> 29:15.733
Where would you like us?
Just there, please.

29:20.773 --> 29:22.773
I love her dress.

29:25.613 --> 29:30.093
Oh, she's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen in my life.

29:30.133 --> 29:33.693
Don't you think, Kitty? Second only
to those jewels round her neck.

29:33.733 --> 29:35.733
Wherever could your mother be?

29:35.773 --> 29:38.493
Well, if Ma's not going, I'm not
either.

29:38.533 --> 29:40.653
Maybe Ma's waiting for us there.

29:40.693 --> 29:42.893
I'm surprised
she hasn't telephoned.

29:42.933 --> 29:45.773
You are coming to.
Right, then. Off we go.

29:46.893 --> 29:48.893
Goodbye.

29:54.333 --> 29:56.493
Thank you for
a wonderful afternoon.

29:56.533 --> 30:00.333
Mrs Buckingham, you simply cannot
miss what we are going to see.

30:00.373 --> 30:02.813
It's history in the making. She's
right.

30:02.853 --> 30:06.133
I can't, I really can't.
Help me, everybody.

30:06.173 --> 30:09.293
We're going to have manhandle
Mrs Buckingham all the way there.

30:09.333 --> 30:12.293
No, no, no. Tell her, Roddy. Tell
her.

30:12.333 --> 30:14.333
Very well.

30:14.373 --> 30:16.733
We're going to see Pavlova in the
flesh.

30:18.613 --> 30:20.613
See? I told you you'd thank me.

30:20.653 --> 30:22.653
Kidnap the lady, my friends.

30:22.693 --> 30:24.693
No. No, Roddy! Roddy, a word.

30:26.613 --> 30:28.613
Go ahead. Go ahead, we'll catch up.

30:30.333 --> 30:32.333
Is everything OK?

30:33.413 --> 30:35.093
What is it?

30:35.133 --> 30:37.893
Why wouldn't you want to come to
the biggest event in town?

30:37.933 --> 30:40.093
Because I'm supposed to be there
already.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.173
I'm Mrs Selfridge.

32:14.093 --> 32:17.413
They're not here for very long,
so get 'em while you can.

32:17.453 --> 32:19.453
Follow me, Miss Pavlova.

32:19.493 --> 32:21.693
Oh, my family's here. Excuse me.

32:21.733 --> 32:23.733
There they are.

32:23.773 --> 32:25.613
Hi, Mom.

32:25.653 --> 32:27.773
Where's Rose?
I thought she'd be here.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.513
No.

32:29.526 --> 32:31.526
Come meet Miss Pavlova.

32:31.566 --> 32:34.686
Miss Pavlova, this is my mother,
Madam Selfridge.

32:34.726 --> 32:37.766
How do you do? Anna Pavlova...

32:37.806 --> 32:41.486
I say, she's every bit as perfect
as the chief said.

32:43.446 --> 32:45.446
Some night this week, Roger, yes?

32:45.486 --> 32:48.726
Depends, my dear. Some of
the nurses do require supervision.

32:48.766 --> 32:52.046
It is really about the nurses
though, isn't it? It's not me.

32:52.086 --> 32:53.886
Of course not.

32:54.926 --> 32:57.406
We can't talk now, Josie, you know
that. Yes.

33:02.646 --> 33:05.246
It was wrong, I should've just told
you the truth.

33:05.286 --> 33:07.286
Yes, you should've.

33:07.326 --> 33:10.886
It's just... everybody know the
Selfridge name and I just...

33:10.926 --> 33:15.526
I guess, I just wanted to have
something that was, well, my own.

33:17.646 --> 33:19.646
Do you know, my father's right?

33:19.686 --> 33:22.446
I am an idiot. Oh, don't say that.

33:22.486 --> 33:25.246
No, I am. You're so kind and
talented. Kind and talented?

33:25.286 --> 33:28.806
I love our time together. Please,
say we can still be friends.

33:29.846 --> 33:31.846
Friends? Yes.

33:32.966 --> 33:35.726
It's no match for the famous Mr
Selfridge though, is it?

33:35.766 --> 33:38.206
You knew I was falling in love with
you.

33:38.246 --> 33:41.326
What was it? What? Was it revenge
for Ellen Love? Was that it?

33:42.566 --> 33:45.086
Half of London knows, don't tell me
you don't.

33:46.126 --> 33:48.126
Harry and I have our bond.

33:48.166 --> 33:50.166
How could he risk losing you?

33:50.206 --> 33:53.486
It's in his nature, he risks the
things that he loves.

33:55.086 --> 33:57.566
And it's my nature
to remain in love with me.

33:59.486 --> 34:01.166
I should go.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.206
Rose, please.

34:06.126 --> 34:07.926
Ellen Love, I didn't...

34:09.126 --> 34:11.126
Please, forgive me.

34:11.166 --> 34:13.166
I was tempted, Roddy.

34:14.686 --> 34:16.686
I owe you that much honesty, at
least.

34:27.406 --> 34:29.406
Gentlemen, it's Miss Love.

34:29.446 --> 34:31.766
Miss Love, this way. Miss Love.

34:31.806 --> 34:34.206
Over here, Miss Love, and a nice,
big smile.

34:34.246 --> 34:35.886
Over here, please, Miss Love.

34:35.926 --> 34:38.206
Now, are you sure this is a good
idea?

34:38.246 --> 34:40.246
Don't be silly, Frank.

34:44.206 --> 34:45.806
Mr Selfridge.

34:45.846 --> 34:48.565
Miss Pavlova, I had to come and see
you.

34:48.606 --> 34:52.206
Ellen Love, the Spirit of
Selfridges.

34:52.246 --> 34:54.246
I don't think I...

34:54.286 --> 34:56.766
Do you dance, Miss Love?

34:56.806 --> 34:59.126
Oh, I surely do. What fun.

34:59.166 --> 35:01.406
Another dancer, Mr Selfridge.

35:01.446 --> 35:05.166
Miss Love is of a contemporary
variety. Doris. Doris, look.

35:05.206 --> 35:07.766
I'm fascinated by this new dance
movement in Europe.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.806
I visited the Isadora Duncan School
in Paris.

35:10.846 --> 35:12.606
It was quite extraordinary.

35:12.646 --> 35:16.126
Or do you favour this more modern,
Bohemian style?

35:16.166 --> 35:18.686
Miss Love sings as well as dances.

35:18.726 --> 35:21.086
Don't you, Miss Love? Yes.

35:21.126 --> 35:23.566
It's so very kind of you to welcome
Miss Pavlova,

35:23.606 --> 35:26.166
but we can't keep you any longer,
Miss Love, please.

35:26.206 --> 35:28.486
Oh, no. No!

35:28.526 --> 35:32.406
Not at all. I have to a photograph
with Miss Pavlova.

35:32.446 --> 35:34.446
Miss Pavlova.

35:34.486 --> 35:37.646
Good publicity.
So sorry about this, Harry.

35:37.686 --> 35:39.686
Coo-ee, boys! Over here!

35:39.726 --> 35:42.446
Dad... A little Champagne?

35:42.486 --> 35:45.246
I'm a customer. Please, Dad.

35:45.286 --> 35:48.046
I've come in to do some shopping.
Dad, people are...

35:49.726 --> 35:51.726
You boys do make me smile.

35:51.766 --> 35:55.166
Beauty and elegance,
that's what the store is all about.

35:55.206 --> 35:56.806
Please - You're a shop girl!

36:01.246 --> 36:03.446
Get that drunk out of our store.
Yes, sir.

36:09.366 --> 36:12.046
You bitch! You should be ashamed of
yourself.

36:12.086 --> 36:14.446
I'm your father, anyhow.

36:14.486 --> 36:16.486
You little bitch.

36:16.526 --> 36:18.126
Happy now?

36:21.726 --> 36:23.966
Thank you, boys. That's enough.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.886
Ellen, with me, now, please.

36:32.926 --> 36:35.526
Mother, will you take the children
to the restaurant?

36:35.566 --> 36:38.926
Come along, children. Go ahead,
we'll see you soon.

36:38.966 --> 36:41.286
Aggie!

36:41.326 --> 36:46.286
Aggie! Agnes, you call this urchin
off me, or you'll be sorry, girl.

36:46.326 --> 36:48.926
Will you please just go?

36:50.286 --> 36:52.286
Lost your job, have you?

36:52.326 --> 36:55.966
See, you're no better than me, my
girl.

36:56.006 --> 36:58.606
You and that stupid, little chump.

36:58.646 --> 37:01.486
You're right. You've ruined
everything.

37:01.526 --> 37:04.646
You've done your damage, now what
more do you want?

37:05.686 --> 37:07.686
I want...

37:07.726 --> 37:11.646
I want some respect from my own
flesh and blood.

37:14.006 --> 37:16.286
I will never respect you.

37:16.326 --> 37:18.326
I hate you.

37:26.646 --> 37:28.646
Now get out of here.

37:41.486 --> 37:44.846
Your Pa is the reason you didn't
want me coming round your place.

37:46.326 --> 37:48.326
I thought it was me.

37:52.246 --> 37:54.246
It'll be all right, Agnes.

37:55.966 --> 37:57.966
No, it won't, Victor.

37:58.006 --> 38:00.326
He'll keep coming back.

38:02.246 --> 38:04.446
Miss Bunting got sacked for a lot
less.

38:04.486 --> 38:07.006
Go to him. Explain.

38:07.046 --> 38:09.046
Mr Selfridge'll understand.

38:09.086 --> 38:13.926
How could he understand what it's
like to have a father like that?

38:13.966 --> 38:15.966
He'll think I'm scum.

38:16.006 --> 38:18.006
Hey.

38:19.046 --> 38:21.246
No-one would ever think that about
you.

38:23.926 --> 38:26.086
I'll look after you, Agnes.

38:27.326 --> 38:29.326
Honest, I will.

38:35.846 --> 38:38.726
You've got your own family to look
after, Victor...

38:39.806 --> 38:41.806
..but thank you.

38:50.966 --> 38:54.766
Oi! Walk your sister upstairs
is what you need to do -

38:54.806 --> 38:58.286
But I have to - ..or there'll be
two of you looking for a job.

39:05.417 --> 39:08.797
And to show you the extent of our
gratitude to Miss Pavlova,

39:08.900 --> 39:11.620
we have one more gift to bestow.

39:13.100 --> 39:16.300
What could it be, Sonya? I can't
imagine, Madame.

39:16.340 --> 39:19.060
You were saying about
a new sable...

39:20.260 --> 39:22.260
You shall have a new sable too.

39:22.300 --> 39:24.620
And there is more? Ah, yes.

39:24.660 --> 39:28.020
The most prestigious gift our store
could offer.

39:28.060 --> 39:30.060
Your very own window.

39:31.300 --> 39:33.300
I think a photo is in order.

39:39.900 --> 39:42.700
You've given her a window?
Keep your voice down.

39:42.740 --> 39:45.820
Please - But, Harry - Let's get you
out of here, Ellen, right now.

39:45.860 --> 39:47.500
Will you call on me, this evening?

39:47.540 --> 39:49.860
Listen, your contract with
Selfridges is over.

39:49.900 --> 39:51.780
All right? Come on. Harry.

39:51.820 --> 39:54.940
Harry, why would you say that?
You've crossed the line.

39:54.980 --> 39:58.340
My family is here.
I don't see your wife anywhere.

39:58.380 --> 40:02.300
My wife is not your concern. The
point is, your reckless nature.

40:03.340 --> 40:07.020
Please, Harry. Please don't leave
me. Please, Harry.

40:08.100 --> 40:11.820
You can keep the flat and whatever
you want. Goodbye, Ellen.

40:11.860 --> 40:15.220
I'm sorry. No. Frank, take her home,
please. Please.

40:15.260 --> 40:17.260
I'm sorry.

40:19.380 --> 40:21.380
Come on, Ellen.

40:21.420 --> 40:23.420
Come on, dear.

40:31.420 --> 40:33.380
Henri? Would you excuse me?

40:33.420 --> 40:36.220
I wanna talk to you about Miss
Pavlova's window.

40:36.260 --> 40:38.260
Indeed, Mr Selfridge.

40:38.300 --> 40:41.420
I know exactly what I want and I'm
gonna work on it with you myself.

40:41.460 --> 40:44.860
I want it to be the talk of London
and I need it on display -

40:44.900 --> 40:46.620
Let me guess, this evening?

40:46.660 --> 40:48.660
Exactly.

40:49.780 --> 40:53.340
Now, if anyone could tell me
where the hell Rose is...

40:53.380 --> 40:54.980
I'm sure you will love it.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.500
Mom? Where's Mom?

41:04.540 --> 41:06.540
Thank you, Fraser.

41:06.580 --> 41:08.580
Mom!

41:08.620 --> 41:10.820
I danced with Anna Pavlova.

41:11.860 --> 41:13.620
Lady Mae clapped her hands off.

41:13.660 --> 41:17.020
I brought you a Pavlova cape
with your initials on it.

41:17.060 --> 41:20.620
Where were you, Ma? Have you any
idea what you've missed? I do.

41:20.660 --> 41:23.420
I'm sorry, everyone,
I wasn't feeling very well.

41:23.460 --> 41:26.180
Right, everyone get ready
for dinner, please.

41:26.220 --> 41:28.540
Better now, Mama? I'm much better.

41:28.580 --> 41:30.180
Thank you.

41:30.220 --> 41:32.220
Come on, dear.

41:35.060 --> 41:38.460
Should I be worried? No, no, I'm
feeling... I'm much better.

41:39.500 --> 41:42.540
You must have been feeling very bad
to miss tea with Pavlova.

41:43.660 --> 41:46.500
I appreciate your arranging that
for me, Harry...

41:48.460 --> 41:50.460
..but I couldn't make it.

42:41.420 --> 42:44.100
From the shop you love,
on Marylebone Street.

42:46.860 --> 42:50.180
Violet creams. Your favourite.
Yeah.

42:51.620 --> 42:54.380
And I've arranged to stay
the night, after all.

42:58.580 --> 43:00.580
I'll get fat.

43:11.220 --> 43:13.220
You're lovely.

43:13.260 --> 43:15.260
Very lovely.

43:27.660 --> 43:29.660
The window.

43:30.740 --> 43:32.740
It's beautiful, Madame.

43:40.260 --> 43:42.260
All in.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.460
Are you sure, Harry, old chap?

44:39.060 --> 44:41.060
Why aren't you at the store? I left.

44:41.100 --> 44:42.700
Who the bloody hell are you?

44:42.740 --> 44:45.860
I have certain conditions to put
before you.

44:45.900 --> 44:47.500
I'm here to tell you

44:47.540 --> 44:49.740
that your husband has not been
faithful to you.

44:49.780 --> 44:52.260
Oh, no, you don't. We need to have
this out.

44:52.300 --> 44:53.900
I'm meant to feel sorry for you?

44:53.940 --> 44:57.060
Well, maybe I will tomorrow,
but tonight you can go to hell!

44:58.942 --> 45:17.013
