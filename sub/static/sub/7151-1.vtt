00:48.760 --> 00:52.355
All my life, I've lived
and worked in the big city

00:52.440 --> 00:55.671
which, now that I think of it,
is kind of a problem,

00:55.800 --> 00:59.156
since I always feel
uncomfortable around crowds.

00:59.240 --> 01:02.073
I mean it.
I have a fear of enclosed spaces.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.555
Everything makes me feel trapped.

01:04.640 --> 01:08.599
I tell myself there's gotta be
something better out there.

01:08.680 --> 01:10.796
But maybe I... I think too much.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.838
I think everything
goes back to the fact...

01:13.960 --> 01:16.474
that I had a very anxious childhood.

01:16.560 --> 01:19.472
My mother never had time for me.

01:19.600 --> 01:23.229
When you're the middle child
in a family of five million,

01:23.320 --> 01:26.676
you don't get any attention.
How is it possible?

01:26.760 --> 01:29.433
And I've had
these abandonment issues.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.751
My father was basically a drone,
like I've said.

01:32.840 --> 01:35.513
And the guy flew away
when I was a larva.

01:35.600 --> 01:40.674
And my job, don't get me started,
because it really annoys me.

01:40.760 --> 01:44.355
l-I was not cut out to be a worker,
I'll tell you right now.

01:44.440 --> 01:47.273
l-l-I feel physically inadequate.

01:47.360 --> 01:50.397
My whole life,
I've never been able to lift...

01:50.480 --> 01:52.994
more than 10 times
my own body weight.

01:53.120 --> 01:57.318
And, when you get down to it,
handling dirt is, you know... urgh,

01:57.400 --> 02:00.039
is not my idea
of a rewarding career.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.998
It's this whole gung ho,
superorganism thing...

02:03.080 --> 02:05.719
that... that, you know, I can't get.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.552
I try, but I don't get it.

02:07.640 --> 02:11.394
I mean... I'm supposed
to do everything for the colony.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.074
A-and what about my needs?
What about me?

02:14.160 --> 02:17.994
I've gotta believe
there's someplace better than this.

02:18.080 --> 02:22.198
Otherwise, I would just curl up
in a larval position and weep.

02:22.280 --> 02:25.636
(Sighs) The whole system
makes me feel...

02:25.720 --> 02:27.711
(Exhales) insignificant.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.076
(Doctor) Excellent.
You've made a breakthrough.

02:31.160 --> 02:34.391
- I have?
- Yes, Z. You are insignificant.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.152
I am?

02:44.360 --> 02:46.271
(Chattering)

02:46.360 --> 02:48.476
(Ant) Ground floor.

03:09.160 --> 03:11.276
(Babies crying softly)

03:13.440 --> 03:15.874
- (Cries)
- Uh, worker.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.631
Soldier.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.551
Ooh. (Giggles)

03:22.640 --> 03:24.756
- Uh-oh.
- Worker.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.271
(Cries)

03:32.280 --> 03:34.316
(Ant) Let's try it again.

03:34.440 --> 03:39.150
Firm grip. Swing hard.
Back straight. Concentrate.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.077
Follow through.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.757
(Grunts)

04:06.480 --> 04:08.869
OK. Got to keep a positive attitude.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.713
Even though
I'm utterly insignificant.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.796
I'm-I'm insignificant, um,
but with attitude.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.110
- (Coughs)
- (Woman) Oh, sorry, Z,

04:18.200 --> 04:20.714
- I didn't see ya.
- Great, Azteca.

04:20.839 --> 04:23.354
I'm so meaningless, I'm invisible.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.436
- (Grunts)
- (Laughter)

04:26.560 --> 04:28.391
Now, you're getting it.

04:28.480 --> 04:31.836
After all, it's not about you.

04:31.960 --> 04:34.713
It's about us... the team.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.314
It's about... this.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.754
Uh, a giant hole in the ground?

04:40.840 --> 04:44.469
- OK, people. Are we feeling good?
- (All) Yeah!

04:44.560 --> 04:46.471
- Yeah.
- Great.

04:46.560 --> 04:51.509
Now, R-1734 through Z-7829,
you guys are on wrecking ball.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.352
- You got it.
- Swell.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.596
- You got it.
- (Ant) All right.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.750
(Enthusiastic shouts)

04:57.840 --> 05:00.308
Now, remember, Azteca,
"Be the ball."

05:00.400 --> 05:04.279
That's the main thing.
You know, be one with the ball.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.191
Would you cut it out already?

05:06.280 --> 05:09.590
Jeez. I love my work.
And you, well...

05:09.680 --> 05:11.989
You think too much.

05:12.080 --> 05:16.153
Come on, Z. Help us build
a bigger, better colony.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.231
And try to be happy about it.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.276
Sure, you know. I mean, why...

05:20.360 --> 05:23.591
How could I be unhappy being
construction equipment?

05:23.680 --> 05:26.274
- OK, workers, remember.
- Here it comes.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.158
- Be the ball.
- Oh!

05:29.240 --> 05:32.312
(Foreman)
Let the energy flow through you.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.552
G-grin and bear it. This is...
this is for the colony. Oh.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.312
- (All yelling)
- Ow!

05:40.400 --> 05:43.870
T-this is just a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.952
- Hang on. Here we go.
- Faster. Harder.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.474
Did you know
heights make me nauseous?

05:49.560 --> 05:50.515
No.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.909
(Ant) This is a ball!

05:53.000 --> 05:55.434
- (All yelling)
- Hey!

06:03.160 --> 06:06.709
- (Azteca) Oh, Z.
- Yes, yes. I dropped the ball.

06:10.560 --> 06:13.233
(Ant) Workers. They're weak.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.551
They lack discipline.
They lack commitment.

06:16.640 --> 06:20.349
General, I know there's
been a glitch or two,

06:20.440 --> 06:23.716
but everybody is working full tilt,
as it is...

06:24.640 --> 06:27.154
You can't help it, it's your nature.

06:27.240 --> 06:29.390
But in spite of your limitations,

06:29.480 --> 06:32.313
you will finish
this tunnel on schedule.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.197
Come hell or high water.

06:34.280 --> 06:38.193
Anyone who falls behind
will explain why to Colonel Cutter.

06:38.280 --> 06:42.876
And let me assure you, the colonel
is not as understanding as I am.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.757
Dismissed.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.117
Four more days, Cutter.
Four more days.

06:50.200 --> 06:53.875
Then we can bid farewell
to their kind of incompetence.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.313
Yes, sir.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.391
A fresh start.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.358
- Imagine it!
- A strong colony, sir.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.317
A colony we can be proud of.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.675
Yes, but we're not there yet.

07:04.760 --> 07:09.356
We just got word that a termite army
has mobilised against us.

07:09.440 --> 07:12.989
- Against us?
- We'll have to send troops...

07:13.080 --> 07:14.877
to attack their colony.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.269
Attack a termite colony, sir?

07:17.360 --> 07:19.316
- That's suicide.
- Exactly.

07:19.400 --> 07:23.188
- Do you have the list I asked for?
- Yes, General.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.239
These are the units
loyal to the queen.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.872
Hm. Then they're
the ones we'll be sending.

07:30.960 --> 07:34.077
It's a shame.
There's some fine officers here.

07:34.160 --> 07:38.233
Don't we need the queen's
approval to declare war?

07:38.320 --> 07:40.276
Our very next stop, Cutter.

07:42.440 --> 07:45.079
General,
we've been at peace for years.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.072
- Why would they attack?
- They want our land.

07:48.160 --> 07:53.234
They're desperate for new territory.
Perhaps they think we've grown soft.

07:53.320 --> 07:57.871
Why don't we dispatch an ambassador,
negotiate a new treaty?

07:57.960 --> 08:01.396
- We don't need to send soldiers.
- Believe me,

08:01.520 --> 08:04.876
every ant in this colony
is so precious to me.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.758
- (Grunts)
- That's why we must strike now.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.910
We have the element of surprise.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.798
If the termite troops
enter our colony...

08:12.880 --> 08:16.759
Yes, General,
I know what they can do to us.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.833
- Very well.
- You've made a wise decision.

08:21.920 --> 08:25.356
In fact, you've ensured
the future of this colony.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.151
Hello, General.

08:30.560 --> 08:33.438
Princess Bala. What a nice surprise.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.988
You look lovelier
each time I see you.

08:36.080 --> 08:40.073
Thanks. I hope you're not
just here on business.

08:40.159 --> 08:42.993
Oh, of course... (Chuckles)
of course not.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.680
Because, um, it might be nice...

08:45.760 --> 08:50.356
if we had a conversation once
before we get married.

08:50.440 --> 08:55.434
You're absolutely right. Schedule me
some private time with Princess Bala.

08:55.520 --> 08:58.876
Uh, sir, there is time now
for a personal moment.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.315
We're a few seconds
ahead of schedule.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.277
Excellent. Princess.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.830
Well, a few seconds isn't much,

09:06.920 --> 09:11.232
but I guess if it's quality time...

09:11.320 --> 09:15.836
So, how was your day?
Anything interesting happen?

09:15.920 --> 09:20.198
- We declared war.
- Declared war?

09:20.280 --> 09:22.157
Boy, talk about a rough day.

09:22.240 --> 09:26.199
Sir, I hate to interrupt,
but time stands still for no ant.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.111
Princess.

09:33.080 --> 09:37.676
Mom, could you remind me,
why am I marrying this guy?

09:37.760 --> 09:40.638
Bala, do we have to argue
about this again?

09:40.720 --> 09:44.508
We don't have anything in common.
The guy's a stiff.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.194
Yes, darling.
I know the General is...

09:47.280 --> 09:50.670
a little gruff
and somewhat overbearing at times,

09:50.760 --> 09:53.558
but I know that he cares about you.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.791
He's just not particularly good
at showing it.

09:56.880 --> 10:00.668
But he was very persistent
when he asked to marry you.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.432
But why me?

10:02.520 --> 10:06.195
Because you're the one
who has to continue my work.

10:06.280 --> 10:11.149
- What if I don't like my place?
- Everyone has their place, Bala...

10:11.240 --> 10:14.232
you, the soldiers, the workers.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.993
It's not that bad
being princess, is it?

10:17.080 --> 10:20.311
Would you rather be
carting around dirt all day?

10:20.400 --> 10:22.197
Mother, don't be so dramatic.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.316
(Music plays)

10:24.400 --> 10:27.198
At least they have some fun
every now and then.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.910
- Two aphid beers.
- Why'd I have to be born a worker?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.356
You soldiers get glory,
plus you get to go outside.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.477
You meet interesting insects,
you kill them.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.711
Yeah. But you get to spend
all day with those...

10:44.800 --> 10:47.360
beautiful worker girls.

10:47.440 --> 10:51.831
Weaver, they're career girls.
They're obsessed with digging.

10:51.920 --> 10:55.799
I don't think I'm ever
gonna meet the right girl for me.

10:55.880 --> 10:59.077
A girl for you?
I was talking about a girl for me.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.469
Don't you want your aphid beer?

11:01.560 --> 11:06.031
Call me crazy, but I can't drink
from the anus of another creature.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.758
Suit yourself.

11:09.680 --> 11:13.992
Ahh. Me, I'm cuttin' loose.
We got royal inspection comin' up.

11:14.080 --> 11:18.790
Standing around like an idiot while
a bunch of blue-bloods smirk at you.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.831
How do you put up with it?

11:20.920 --> 11:23.639
Z, I've known you
for a long time, right?

11:23.720 --> 11:25.915
You were born two seconds after me.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.276
And ever since then
I've listened to you complain.

11:29.360 --> 11:33.194
What are you bitching about?
We ants are running the show.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.191
We're the lords of the Earth.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.999
Hey, don't talk to me
about earth, OK?

11:38.080 --> 11:41.595
Cos I just spent all day
hauling it around.

11:41.680 --> 11:44.911
(Sighs) There's just
gotta be a better place.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.468
There is. I've been there.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.676
Sorry? Were you talking to me?

11:50.760 --> 11:53.672
There is a better place...

11:53.760 --> 11:55.432
Insectopia.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.158
Oh, really?

11:57.240 --> 11:59.435
Lunatic at three o'clock.

11:59.520 --> 12:03.513
You can't understand till you
go there and see it yourself.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.590
You can be your own ant there.

12:06.680 --> 12:09.035
The streets are paved with food.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.156
Nobody tellin' you what to do.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.639
No wars.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.278
No colony.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.718
- I shoulda never left.
- Oh. Fascinating.

12:18.800 --> 12:22.713
We were on a long-range recon.
I got cut off from my unit.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.429
Nothing like post-traumatic stress
disorder to complete your day.

12:26.520 --> 12:29.114
- Then I saw it! Insectopia!
- Hey!

12:29.200 --> 12:31.111
You head towards the monolith.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.749
Ten clicks past the canyons
to the land of red and white.

12:34.840 --> 12:37.195
You've had enough for one night.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.748
Come on. Before you get in trouble.

12:39.840 --> 12:43.276
Head for the monolith. Listen to me!
The monolith!

12:44.320 --> 12:46.197
That guy's got a screw loose.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.748
- Across the lake!
- Insectopia. Hmm.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.035
It'd be great if it were that easy.

12:51.120 --> 12:54.669
- Yeah. Dream on, Z.
- Cross the lake!

12:54.760 --> 12:57.558
Look for the land of red and white!

12:57.640 --> 12:59.631
Wow!

12:59.720 --> 13:03.190
This is so... gritty.

13:03.280 --> 13:06.317
Ten minutes, right?
This place is off limits.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.994
Just blame me.
Say it was all my idea.

13:09.080 --> 13:14.108
- It is all your idea.
- Besides, no one will recognise us.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.555
Come on, girls. What do you say?

13:16.640 --> 13:19.837
Let's take a walk on the wild side.

13:20.840 --> 13:24.515
(Dull voice on PA)
'OK, everybody, 6:15. Time to dance.'

13:24.600 --> 13:27.558
- Time to cut a rug, Z.
- Oh, no. That's OK.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.871
I'm gonna leave the rug
just the way it is, Weaver.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.430
(# Slow jazz)

13:41.800 --> 13:43.552
Step back, ladies.

13:43.640 --> 13:46.950
I'm gonna ask one of these
workers to dance with me.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.519
Oh.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.876
What a bunch of losers.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.669
Mindless zombies capitulating
to an oppressive system.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.512
Hi. Wanna dance?

13:57.600 --> 13:59.591
Absolutely.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.790
Follow me.

14:02.880 --> 14:06.395
So, how come I haven't seen you
around here before?

14:06.480 --> 14:10.234
Oh, I don't get out much.
I, uh, I work over at the palace.

14:10.320 --> 14:13.630
The palace?
I bet those royals really live it up.

14:13.720 --> 14:17.156
Course they're all...
you know... from inbreeding.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.389
What?

14:21.840 --> 14:23.398
Yowch!

14:24.880 --> 14:28.190
Y-y... yowch! Yowch.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.231
- Yooowch.
- What on earth are you doing?

14:35.320 --> 14:39.677
Well, actually, to tell you
the truth, I'm sort of making it up.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.193
Really?

14:41.280 --> 14:45.956
Why does everybody have to dance
the same? That's completely boring.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.951
It's no fun.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.429
(# Samba)

15:16.120 --> 15:18.509
Hey. Watch your step, worker.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.478
You watch yours
or you'll be in big trouble!

15:21.560 --> 15:24.791
Th-th-that's OK.
I'll... let him off this time.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.599
Are you crazy?
He's built like a pebble.

15:27.680 --> 15:32.390
- Aren't you gonna defend yourself?
- Hey, buddy. Get back in place.

15:32.480 --> 15:35.950
- Me? Uh... uh...
- What if he doesn't want to?

15:37.560 --> 15:40.120
Yeah. What if I don't like my place?

15:40.200 --> 15:43.556
- We got us a troublemaker.
- Buckle up, Spanky.

15:43.640 --> 15:47.838
This one goes out
to all the lazy workers.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.148
(Grunts)

15:49.240 --> 15:51.800
Watch that aggressive behaviour,
buddy.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.950
He's just a worker. (Muffled)

15:54.040 --> 15:57.077
- (Ants shouting)
- (Chuckles)

16:13.000 --> 16:17.471
Princess Bala! Princess Bala!
The guards are coming.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.358
- Let's get outta here.
- Wait.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.476
(Shouting and fighting)

16:22.560 --> 16:24.755
Princess? You're a princess?

16:24.880 --> 16:26.996
Uh... I gotta go.

16:27.080 --> 16:30.231
- When can I see you again?
- Let me think.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.992
Never.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.594
- Bye.
- No, wait!

16:36.200 --> 16:37.155
Oof!

16:40.520 --> 16:42.351
# What a day it has been

16:42.440 --> 16:45.273
# What a rare mood I'm in

16:45.360 --> 16:49.239
# Why, it's almost like
being in love

16:49.320 --> 16:54.997
# There's a smile on my face
for the whole insect race

16:55.080 --> 16:58.516
# Why, it's almost like
being in love #

16:58.600 --> 17:00.511
(Whistle blows)

17:09.319 --> 17:11.196
Yowch.

17:15.119 --> 17:17.395
(General chatter)

17:26.560 --> 17:29.711
- Can I get you another one, pal?
- No... thanks.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.076
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Yeah. I don't blame you.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.709
It's always slow in here
before those royal reviews.

17:36.800 --> 17:40.952
I guess soldiers need their shuteye
before they meet the queen.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.598
That's it!

17:42.680 --> 17:44.796
You know, I was once...

17:44.880 --> 17:46.552
See ya.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.715
(Snoring)

17:52.840 --> 17:55.354
Psst. Weaver.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.829
I figured it out. Weaver. Weaver!

17:57.960 --> 17:59.757
What? What?

17:59.880 --> 18:02.633
I got a great idea.
Switch places with me.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.359
Let me go to the inspection
instead of you.

18:05.440 --> 18:09.399
- What time is it?
- The royal family will be there.

18:09.480 --> 18:13.314
- This is the only way I can see her.
- See who?

18:13.400 --> 18:16.233
- Princess Bala.
- Are you nuts?

18:16.320 --> 18:19.039
You want me
to switch places with you?

18:19.120 --> 18:23.910
Do you know how much trouble you can
get into for impersonatin' a soldier?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.468
It's trouble
just listenin' to someone

18:26.560 --> 18:29.154
talkin' about
impersonatin' a soldier.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.912
You have to help me.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.913
If I can't see her again,
my life is not worth living.

18:35.040 --> 18:38.157
P-p-please, Weaver. Please.

18:38.240 --> 18:41.198
Switch jobs with me just, you know,
for a day.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.953
Th-think of everything
I've done for you.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.634
Hm. I can't think of anything.

18:46.720 --> 18:50.633
OK. So, think of all the things
that I'm gonna do for you.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.756
Would I meet some worker girls?

18:54.840 --> 18:57.991
Are you kidding?
They always go for the new guy.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.911
It's like a sport for them.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.199
And they will definitely go for
an adorable little insect like you.

19:05.280 --> 19:08.875
Weaver, I... I have to see her again.

19:08.960 --> 19:13.158
Z, what kind of chance
do you have with a princess?

19:13.240 --> 19:17.153
I mean, she probably
won't even remember you.

19:17.280 --> 19:21.273
(Sighs) l-I know it sounds nuts...

19:21.360 --> 19:23.396
but I have to try.

19:24.840 --> 19:26.831
- Oh, boy.
- (Marching music)

19:28.040 --> 19:30.110
Princess, fancy meeting you here.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.038
What do you say we... lose this crowd?

19:34.120 --> 19:37.556
Oh, me?
You know, I... I wear many hats.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.279
You'd have to call me
a Renaissance ant.

19:40.360 --> 19:41.998
(Man) Eyes right!

19:46.240 --> 19:50.119
- Beautiful! Just beautiful!
- Mm.

19:50.240 --> 19:53.277
- The precision. The order.
- Oh.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.636
Princess Bala! Princess Bala!
Hey. It's me.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.557
Remember Z from the bar?

19:58.640 --> 20:01.950
Princess Bala!
Princess Bala! Princess...

20:02.040 --> 20:04.634
Bala, you must encourage the troops.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.517
Wave.

20:06.600 --> 20:10.479
Oh. She sees me.
Excuse me, guys. l-I... Sorry.

20:10.560 --> 20:13.711
- I just got a better offer. Excu...
- Company halt!

20:18.120 --> 20:21.237
Princess! (Princess Bala!)

20:21.320 --> 20:23.629
Quiet there! Get back in rank.

20:23.720 --> 20:27.952
- You new, kid?
- Y-yes, but I'm gettin' out soon.

20:28.040 --> 20:30.190
I got a trial membership.

20:30.280 --> 20:33.272
Trial membership. (Chuckles)
Good one!

20:33.360 --> 20:35.954
- Name's Barbatus.
- Z.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.917
- Right face!
- Psst.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.879
(Whip cracks)

20:45.960 --> 20:47.439
Sacrifice.

20:47.520 --> 20:50.796
To some, it is just a word.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.950
To others, it is a code.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.634
- I'm bad at word games.
- (Chuckles)

20:55.720 --> 20:59.429
A soldier knows that the life
of one ant doesn't matter.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.351
What matters is the colony.

21:01.440 --> 21:04.796
He'll live for the colony,
fight for the colony,

21:04.880 --> 21:06.438
die for the colony.

21:06.520 --> 21:09.876
- This guy's crazy.
- I hear ya.

21:09.960 --> 21:14.590
At 0800 hours, we received word
that the termite enemy has mobilised.

21:14.680 --> 21:18.070
We have no choice
but to launch a pre-emptive strike.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.628
You are the queen's finest.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.393
I know you will all do your duty.

21:23.480 --> 21:26.153
I am proud to send you into battle.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.708
Into... I'm... I'm sorry. Into battle?

21:28.800 --> 21:33.032
- Dismissed.
- Left face! Forward march!

21:33.120 --> 21:35.873
I think there's been
a terrible mistake.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.793
The truth is
I just... came for the speech.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.314
Don't worry, kid.
I'll watch out for ya.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.633
- Sound off.
- One!

21:49.720 --> 21:51.631
- Two!
- Three!

21:51.720 --> 21:53.836
- Huh?
- Five!

21:53.920 --> 21:55.273
- Six!
- Seven!

21:55.360 --> 21:56.713
- Eight!
- Nine!

21:56.800 --> 21:58.153
- Ten!
- Eleven!

21:58.240 --> 21:59.593
- Twelve!
- Thirteen!

22:00.320 --> 22:04.029
# We ants go marching one by one
hurrah, hurrah

22:04.160 --> 22:08.711
(All) # We slaughter termites
just for fun, hurrah, hurrah... #

22:08.800 --> 22:11.234
So, these termites, th-they're...

22:11.320 --> 22:13.356
We're talkin' pushovers, right

22:13.440 --> 22:16.113
Not really,
they're five times our size.

22:16.200 --> 22:19.078
And they shoot acid
from their foreheads.

22:19.160 --> 22:21.037
Hey! Keep it movin', shorty!

22:21.120 --> 22:25.796
(All) # We ants go marching
two by two, hurrah, hurrah

22:25.880 --> 22:29.316
# We'll all be dead before
we're through, hurrah... #

22:29.400 --> 22:32.756
Say, exactly... what exactly
does our platoon do?

22:32.840 --> 22:36.992
I mean, will we be serving beverages
or processing paperwork?

22:37.080 --> 22:40.516
Our platoon has the best assignment -
first into battle.

22:40.600 --> 22:44.878
# We ants go marching three by three,
hurrah, hurrah

22:44.960 --> 22:46.552
(All) Hurrah! Hurrah!

22:46.640 --> 22:51.236
# We're off to face our destiny
hurrah, hurrah... #

22:51.320 --> 22:54.278
Let's not...
We're being too hasty here.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.476
These guys sound like bruisers.

22:56.560 --> 22:59.154
How were you figuring
on beating them?

22:59.240 --> 23:04.155
Superior numbers, kid. Overwhelm
their defences and kill their queen.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.913
Fellas, you're being
a little extreme.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.516
Let's influence their political
process with campaign contributions.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.518
I like you, kid.
You got a sense of humour.

23:15.640 --> 23:16.993
Forward!

23:17.080 --> 23:19.833
Come on!
Let's kick some termite butt!

23:19.960 --> 23:21.518
Over the top!

23:22.560 --> 23:25.597
- (All shouting)
- Yeeow!

23:33.480 --> 23:34.799
Yee-ha!

23:46.040 --> 23:47.837
(Shouting stops)

23:51.920 --> 23:54.957
- Where is everyone?
- Something's not right.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.552
Don't be scared, kid.

24:00.920 --> 24:02.751
- (Gasps)
- (Growls)

24:02.840 --> 24:05.115
They're here! Ahh!

24:05.720 --> 24:08.518
Attack!

24:19.240 --> 24:22.118
(Shouting, roaring and screaming)

24:26.880 --> 24:28.677
(Groans)

24:31.400 --> 24:32.958
Come on!

24:40.480 --> 24:42.232
- (Roars)
- Ahh!

24:47.600 --> 24:50.068
Barbatus, you saved my life.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.435
Don't get all sappy about it.

24:59.760 --> 25:02.513
- Hey, guys! Behind you!
- (Roars)

25:10.360 --> 25:12.112
Hey... hey, guys?

25:12.200 --> 25:14.475
Can somebody help me here?
Anybody...?

25:27.960 --> 25:29.234
Yeah!

25:29.320 --> 25:31.276
(Grunting)

25:32.360 --> 25:34.669
OK, mama! Unh!

25:34.760 --> 25:36.716
Yeah. Oof!

25:37.520 --> 25:40.751
Oh, yeah. Big guy comin' through.
(Grunts)

25:42.160 --> 25:43.991
I love it.

25:49.320 --> 25:52.437
Hey, hey, hey!
Take it easy, muscles.

25:53.560 --> 25:56.358
You're makin'
the rest of us look bad.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.271
What happened to Z?

25:58.360 --> 26:02.239
He's... takin' a personal day,
so I'm filling in.

26:02.320 --> 26:05.517
You fill in any more,
and you'll explode.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.632
Eh, you got a problem?

26:11.720 --> 26:16.236
No, uh... uh... Nobody told me
digging was so much fun.

26:16.320 --> 26:19.198
You know, you pick the dirt up.
You move it.

26:19.280 --> 26:23.478
You pick it up again.
You move it again. Lots of reps.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.710
You exercise the arms
and the thorax.

26:25.800 --> 26:28.473
Yes, I... I see what you mean.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.511
- Yeah. Fascinating.
- Sorry, sir!

26:30.640 --> 26:32.949
I was just chattin'
with my friend, sir.

26:33.040 --> 26:37.318
You know, I just had a chat
with General Mandible.

26:37.400 --> 26:41.439
Anybody who doesn't meet his quota
is going to be downsized.

26:41.520 --> 26:44.830
Come on. Cut him a break. He's new.

26:44.960 --> 26:49.954
Hey. What do you say we help
your attitude a little bit...

26:50.040 --> 26:54.511
by taking away
your rations for the day.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.431
Thanks for your time.

26:57.400 --> 27:01.393
I don't know what came over me.
Talking back like that?

27:02.160 --> 27:04.071
I must be losin' it.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.037
Sorry I got you in trouble.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.873
But, you can...
share my rations... Whoa!

27:08.960 --> 27:10.837
If you want.

27:10.920 --> 27:14.390
- Are you askin' me out to dinner?
- (Chuckles)

27:14.480 --> 27:16.436
Oh, no. I...

27:16.520 --> 27:20.798
Well, if you don't have
anything else planned...

27:20.880 --> 27:23.952
(Laughs) I'll check my calendar.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.792
You know,

27:25.880 --> 27:28.917
I'm kinda glad Z's takin' a breather.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.917
Kid!

28:01.000 --> 28:03.116
Kid, over here.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.198
Barbatus.

28:06.280 --> 28:09.750
Be honest, kid. Am I hurt bad?

28:09.840 --> 28:14.595
N-no. N-not at all. You're...
Actually, you're lookin' terrific.

28:14.680 --> 28:17.831
You got, you know,
swell colour in your cheeks.

28:17.920 --> 28:21.833
No. I can see it in your eyes.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.751
I'm a goner.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.991
Help me up, Z.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.752
(Sniffs)

28:29.840 --> 28:32.229
I c-can't feel my legs.

28:32.320 --> 28:36.950
You gotta hang in there, buddy.
I know you're gonna make it.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.235
Just take... take deep breaths.

28:39.320 --> 28:42.437
Because I'm gonna try
and find your body.

28:42.520 --> 28:46.354
It's bound to be...
out there... s-somewhere.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.552
(Coughs, sighs)

28:53.680 --> 28:56.114
B-Barbatus, hang on.

28:56.200 --> 29:01.718
- B-Barbatus.
- Don't make my mistake, kid.

29:02.960 --> 29:05.997
Don't follow orders your whole life.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.993
Think for yourself. Ohh...

29:13.360 --> 29:15.157
Barbatus.

29:28.360 --> 29:32.797
(Cutter) We're on schedule. Work
is completed on "A" section, sir.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.996
We're clearing "D" section now.

29:35.080 --> 29:38.277
I want double shifts
around the clock.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.079
- Is that clear?
- Crystal, sir.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.435
Good. What about section...

29:43.520 --> 29:46.557
- Excuse me, sir.
- This better be important.

29:46.640 --> 29:48.710
It's the termite battle, sir.

29:48.800 --> 29:53.476
The enemy was destroyed, but it was
a disaster for our troops, as well.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.950
Well, that's terrible. Terrible.

29:57.040 --> 30:00.316
There is good news, sir.
One soldier made it back.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.072
- No kidding.
- What?

30:02.160 --> 30:06.153
Word is spreading. The Queen
wants to meet the war hero.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.559
Damn!

30:07.640 --> 30:09.835
Good. Damn good.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.558
Uh, I'll handle this.

30:12.560 --> 30:13.959
(Footsteps approaching)

30:15.080 --> 30:17.674
- Congratulations, soldier.
- (Ahem)

30:18.720 --> 30:21.871
You're a little short for a war hero,
aren't you?

30:21.960 --> 30:27.273
A war hero? Sir, l-I don't
actually think that I'm a hero.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.396
Good. I don't like heroes.

30:29.480 --> 30:31.630
But, sir. You don't understand...

30:31.720 --> 30:33.711
(Crowd cheering)

30:38.840 --> 30:41.308
I... I didn't do anything.

30:41.400 --> 30:45.359
I mean, it was all horrible.
It was just... just a massacre.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.431
A-a massacre upon a massacre.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.909
That's good, soldier. Now, wave.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.353
(Cheering)

30:56.760 --> 30:59.399
There was nothing
you could do, Weaver.

30:59.480 --> 31:02.040
You didn't know
they were going to war.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.997
I just feel horrible.

31:04.080 --> 31:08.073
Poor Z.
I should have never let him go.

31:08.160 --> 31:12.278
Wait a minute.
That's no soldier. That's Z!

31:12.360 --> 31:16.319
Z? The little guy made it!
(Chuckles)

31:16.400 --> 31:18.118
(Crowd cheering)

31:19.960 --> 31:21.552
Let's go, soldier.

31:21.640 --> 31:22.789
(Cheers)

31:24.080 --> 31:25.593
(Cheers)

31:30.080 --> 31:34.153
As I was saying, son,
you are an ant after my own heart.

31:34.280 --> 31:37.955
An ant that looks Death
in the face and laughs.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.632
Well, the truth is,

31:39.720 --> 31:42.678
l-I just make belittling comments...

31:42.760 --> 31:45.832
and snicker behind Death's back.
(Chuckles)

31:45.920 --> 31:48.957
(Queen) General Mandible.

31:49.040 --> 31:53.397
Keep your comments to yourself.
Let me do the talking.

31:59.360 --> 32:00.873
(Yawns)

32:00.960 --> 32:04.748
May I present
Her Majesty the Queen.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.353
Charmed. Charmed.

32:06.440 --> 32:08.351
And the Royal Princess Bala.

32:08.440 --> 32:09.395
(Purrs)

32:09.480 --> 32:11.755
Welcome home, soldier.

32:11.840 --> 32:16.197
We cannot begin to express our
gratitude for your heroic efforts.

32:16.280 --> 32:19.511
The private asked me to convey
his humble appreciation.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.353
Please, please,
it was nothing, really.

32:22.440 --> 32:27.389
Just run-of-the-mill valour...
and extraordinary courage, you know.

32:27.480 --> 32:30.631
In battle,
there's very little time to think.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.917
One must attack! Attack! Attack!

32:34.000 --> 32:36.594
- (Chuckles) Well, indeed.
- (Muffled)

32:36.680 --> 32:41.196
As you can see, Your Highness, the
battlefield is fresh in his mind,

32:41.280 --> 32:44.795
so this is the perfect time
to debrief the private.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.792
Oh, please, General.
Not on our first date.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.235
(Chuckles) "Not on our first date."

32:50.320 --> 32:53.039
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

32:53.120 --> 32:55.873
Well, maybe. Then again, maybe not.

32:55.960 --> 32:59.430
And then... then again...
Yowch.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.034
That's it! The guy from the bar.

33:02.120 --> 33:04.793
- Don't... Shh.
- Bar? What bar?

33:04.880 --> 33:08.077
I danced with this guy at the bar
the other night.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.991
He was just a worker, then.

33:10.080 --> 33:13.709
- What were you doing at a bar?
- That's what I want to know.

33:13.800 --> 33:18.157
No. This isn't about me. I mean,
look what this worker's done.

33:18.240 --> 33:21.437
You're thinkin' of someone else.
I am a soldier.

33:21.520 --> 33:24.671
Exactly. You WERE a worker

33:24.760 --> 33:27.399
but now, you're a war hero.

33:27.480 --> 33:31.075
- He's a worker?
- A worker danced with my fiancée?

33:31.160 --> 33:33.071
F-fiancée?

33:33.160 --> 33:35.355
W-w-wait a minute.

33:35.440 --> 33:38.000
This is not how it looks.
I can explain.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.389
She was the one making all the moves.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.311
Arrest him.

33:42.400 --> 33:44.675
H-hey, wait, can't we discuss this?

33:44.760 --> 33:47.149
What are you doing? Let go of her!

33:47.240 --> 33:49.390
- He's taking her hostage!
- Huh?

33:49.480 --> 33:52.836
No. No, I'm not.
I mean, yes, I am.

33:52.920 --> 33:55.593
One more step
and the princess gets it.

33:55.680 --> 33:58.353
Oh, let go of me!

33:58.440 --> 34:00.635
Ow! Don't make me hurt her.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.597
Get off!

34:07.160 --> 34:10.311
(Both screaming)

34:15.960 --> 34:20.556
(Groans) Ugh. Oh.
What are you doing, you creep?

34:20.639 --> 34:23.552
Are you out of your puny little mind?

34:23.639 --> 34:26.279
(Ant) There they are! Let's go! Move!

34:26.360 --> 34:28.351
Oh, good.

34:28.440 --> 34:31.476
Here they come,
to rescue me... and kill you.

34:31.560 --> 34:32.879
Kill?

34:32.960 --> 34:35.757
- Hey, you guys!
- Stop! What are you doing?

34:35.840 --> 34:37.512
Get off, you little twerp!

34:37.600 --> 34:40.273
Don't throw away
everything we've got!

34:40.920 --> 34:45.357
What're you waiting for? Hello! Guys!

34:51.760 --> 34:54.228
- Huh?
- What is it?

34:57.600 --> 34:59.830
It's beautiful.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.275
Ridgeway, get out of there!

35:26.880 --> 35:28.552
- Oof!
- Oh!

35:39.000 --> 35:41.468
(Both sigh)

35:41.560 --> 35:45.075
- Oh, don't worry. I'm OK.
- You?!

35:45.160 --> 35:49.073
You're OK?
Hey, who cares about you?

35:49.160 --> 35:51.276
- I almost died.
- Calm down.

35:51.360 --> 35:55.148
Don't let a little
near-death experience ruin your mood.

35:55.240 --> 35:59.074
Hey, this is not a mood.
You're not listening to me.

36:00.320 --> 36:01.912
Where am I?

36:05.120 --> 36:10.592
Look, what's-your-name, just climb up
that tree and find out where I am.

36:10.680 --> 36:13.672
Look, th-the trick is not to panic.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.274
You know,
h-h-he w-who panics is lost.

36:16.360 --> 36:19.716
What am I saying? We are lost.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.832
- Whoa!
- (Gasps)

36:24.920 --> 36:26.273
(Chuckles)

36:26.360 --> 36:27.634
Ow!

36:29.240 --> 36:32.073
I've been kidnapped
by the village idiot.

36:32.160 --> 36:33.639
Who's the bigger idiot -

36:33.720 --> 36:37.030
the idiot, or the idiot
who gets kidnapped by the idiot?

36:37.120 --> 36:39.395
Did you talk those termites to death?

36:39.480 --> 36:43.359
I can't believe you tried
to pass yourself off as a soldier.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.271
Why are you stalking me?

36:45.360 --> 36:48.511
Don't you realise that I'm...
out of your league?

36:48.600 --> 36:51.831
YOU were cruising the worker bar
for action,

36:51.920 --> 36:53.956
And you happened to find it...

36:54.040 --> 36:57.669
the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker.

36:58.560 --> 37:02.269
Please. I was slumming it.
Don't you get it?

37:02.360 --> 37:07.115
I chose you because you were the most
pathetic little bug in the joint.

37:07.200 --> 37:11.159
I was gonna let you become part
of my most erotic fantasies,

37:11.240 --> 37:13.435
but now, you can forget that.

37:13.520 --> 37:17.957
You know, I guess what you prefer
is Old Blood and Guts.

37:18.040 --> 37:22.113
His idea of a romantic night out
is two seats at an execution.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.760
You really chose the right husband.

37:24.840 --> 37:26.671
For your information,

37:26.760 --> 37:31.231
the General and I
are deeply, deeply in...

37:31.520 --> 37:33.078
engaged.

37:33.160 --> 37:36.072
You come right back
down here this instant!

37:36.160 --> 37:39.869
We are marching straight back
to the colony so that I...

37:39.960 --> 37:42.793
(Bala continues in background)

37:45.160 --> 37:47.116
The monolith!

37:48.320 --> 37:50.914
Wonderful. That's an appealing offer.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.232
But, considering the options, you go.
I'm going to Insectopia.

37:55.320 --> 38:01.236
Oh, come on. Insectopia?
You're crazier than I thought.

38:01.320 --> 38:05.518
Yeah? Well, I happen to have it
on a very reliable source.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.875
(Ahem) Or... or should I say,

38:07.960 --> 38:09.951
a drunk, raving source?

38:10.040 --> 38:14.192
But the point is, I'm convinced
the place definitely exists.

38:14.280 --> 38:18.319
Stop! I order you to stop, worker!

38:18.400 --> 38:21.836
Hey, I got a name, OK? It's Z.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.798
And out here,
you can't order me around.

38:24.880 --> 38:27.678
All right. Fine. No problem.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.637
Oh...!

38:34.680 --> 38:36.477
(Rumbling)

38:36.560 --> 38:39.358
Wha-what? (Screams)

38:40.640 --> 38:42.870
- (Growls)
- (Gasps)

38:42.960 --> 38:45.997
Worker! Worker! Where are you?

38:46.080 --> 38:50.153
Z? Z? Wait for me.

38:51.160 --> 38:54.516
No more excuses, General.
I want my daughter back.

38:54.600 --> 38:58.115
I'm beginning to doubt
your ability to handle this.

38:58.200 --> 39:01.670
Your Highness, we will
spare no effort to bring her back.

39:01.760 --> 39:07.312
Princess Bala is... essential
to all our plans for the future.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.630
So he kills himself 100 termites,

39:09.720 --> 39:14.635
gets a few medals, then bada-bing,
bada-bip, bags himself the Princess.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.632
- He looks him in the eye...
- And says, "Bite me."

39:17.720 --> 39:19.472
To General Mandible?

39:19.560 --> 39:22.074
Buddy. Hey, hey, buddy.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.515
You heard about the war hero named Z?

39:24.600 --> 39:26.875
Runs off with the Princess, right?

39:26.960 --> 39:31.317
When they sent the guards after him,
he just looks at 'em and boom!

39:31.400 --> 39:35.473
- They burst into flames.
- Z? (Chuckles) You talkin' about Z?

39:35.560 --> 39:38.632
I know Z. He's a friend of mine.
I think you...

39:38.720 --> 39:42.395
- You know Z?
- Yeah. He's a worker.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.436
A worker? That's impossible.

39:44.520 --> 39:47.273
A worker can't do anything,
except work.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.237
Yeah. We got no choice.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.993
We do have a choice.
Uh, I mean, look at Z.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.753
He wanted something,
and he went for it.

39:54.840 --> 39:59.038
He's not alone. I was a soldier
and I switched places with him.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.678
You're tellin' me...

40:00.760 --> 40:03.558
- I don't have to be here?
- We've got a choice?

40:04.600 --> 40:08.149
They don't want you to know,
but we don't have to work.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.959
Workers control
the means of production.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.951
If Z don't dig, I don't dig.

40:13.040 --> 40:17.158
People, what is this,
an encounter group? Get back to work.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.355
Why?

40:18.440 --> 40:22.831
...on the tunnel! This guy, Z,
he's leadin' a revolution!

40:22.920 --> 40:24.797
I'll... get back to you.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.394
(All chattering)

40:33.880 --> 40:36.872
Think about it, Z... two ants.

40:36.960 --> 40:41.431
Who ever heard of two ants?
Two million ants, maybe. But two?

40:43.120 --> 40:47.159
Look, I'm hungry, I'm thirsty...

40:47.240 --> 40:49.800
And this whole desert thing?

40:49.880 --> 40:53.270
- It just doesn't work for me.
- Yada, yada, yada...

40:53.400 --> 40:55.709
It's about time you took me back.

40:55.840 --> 40:58.308
Take yourself back. Phew.

40:58.440 --> 41:01.796
Excuse me!
You kidnapped me, remember?

41:01.880 --> 41:05.555
That means you have
certain responsibilities.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.359
You can't just abandon me here.

41:08.440 --> 41:11.989
- It's better than the colony.
- You're not serious?!

41:12.080 --> 41:16.517
Maybe you were living it up,
but personally, this beats digging.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.990
If you'd ever done
a day's labour you'd know.

41:21.160 --> 41:23.754
Labour?
What do you know about labour?

41:23.840 --> 41:26.559
How would you feel
if you had to give birth

41:26.640 --> 41:29.393
every ten seconds
for the rest of your life?

41:29.480 --> 41:32.631
- Gee.
- Water!

41:36.640 --> 41:39.518
Ahh. All you think about is yourself.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.955
Nobody else ever thought about me.

41:42.040 --> 41:44.918
So I don't need anybody else.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.718
Unh!

41:46.800 --> 41:49.360
(Muffled) Help! Help me, Bala!

41:51.280 --> 41:55.398
Help! B-B-B-B-Bala!

41:55.480 --> 41:57.357
I'll get you out. Hold on.

41:58.240 --> 42:00.515
Help, Ba...

42:15.800 --> 42:18.109
(Both gasping)

42:20.400 --> 42:23.676
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

42:23.760 --> 42:27.753
Now, maybe we can put
this fantasy behind us...

42:27.840 --> 42:29.910
and head back to the colon...

42:30.000 --> 42:33.276
Oh, Z! What are you doing?

42:33.360 --> 42:36.989
- We've gotta cross the lake.
- Am I missing something?

42:37.080 --> 42:40.311
Didn't we just get OUT of the water?

42:41.160 --> 42:43.799
Bala, look,
what have you got to lose?

42:43.880 --> 42:49.079
I mean, think about it. Do you really
want to be Mrs Raving Lunatic?

42:51.680 --> 42:53.989
There's a better place.

42:55.360 --> 42:57.430
Z, please.

42:57.520 --> 42:59.954
Just... gimme one chance.

43:00.040 --> 43:02.235
If we don't find Insectopia soon,

43:02.320 --> 43:05.596
I promise
I'll take you back to the colony.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.433
(Bala) I hope you know
what you're doing.

43:22.520 --> 43:24.272
(Z) Yeah, me too.

43:29.280 --> 43:31.077
(Indistinct shouting)

43:32.080 --> 43:35.356
(Chanting) We want Z! We want Z!

43:35.440 --> 43:39.797
People, come on. I know some ants
who won't make their quota.

43:39.880 --> 43:42.314
Buzz off, pawn of the oppressor.

43:43.120 --> 43:47.113
(Chanting continues)
We want Z! We want Z!

43:48.120 --> 43:52.557
Sorry, sir. I came as soon as I
heard. I was debriefing the trackers.

43:52.640 --> 43:55.837
- And? What's the report?
- Well, this Z, sir...

43:55.920 --> 43:57.876
He's one slippery character.

43:57.960 --> 44:01.032
They lost Bala's trail
at the edge of the lake.

44:01.120 --> 44:03.111
The lake?

44:03.200 --> 44:05.873
(All) # All we are saying

44:05.960 --> 44:09.270
# Is give Z a chance... #

44:09.360 --> 44:11.749
What's that soldier doing there?

44:11.880 --> 44:15.998
It appears he's holding hands, sir.
With a worker.

44:16.080 --> 44:19.356
I don't like the way
things are going, Cutter.

44:19.440 --> 44:21.874
I'm counting on you for results.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.474
- Can I depend on you or not?
- Yes, sir.

44:24.560 --> 44:26.755
All right. Let's wrap this up.

44:26.840 --> 44:31.072
(Chanting)
We want Z! We want Z! We want Z!

44:32.160 --> 44:35.277
I've heard a lot about this Z.

44:36.480 --> 44:40.268
I even had the pleasure
of meeting him once.

44:41.440 --> 44:43.271
But where is he now?!

44:43.360 --> 44:45.794
Can anyone point him out?

44:47.840 --> 44:51.469
I mean, if this Z
cares so much about us,

44:51.560 --> 44:53.437
then why isn't he here?

44:54.800 --> 44:56.438
I'll tell you why.

44:56.520 --> 44:59.512
Because Z doesn't
give a damn about us.

44:59.600 --> 45:01.591
(Ants murmuring)

45:01.680 --> 45:05.275
That's why he kidnapped our princess
and ran away.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.551
Z is no hero.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.631
We are the heroes.

45:10.720 --> 45:14.793
We are the ones ensuring
the future of our great colony.

45:14.880 --> 45:18.589
And when we've completed
this magnificent structure,

45:18.680 --> 45:21.240
we will reap the benefits -

45:21.320 --> 45:24.198
more food and less work for everyone.

45:24.280 --> 45:25.838
(Murmurs of approval)

45:25.920 --> 45:28.639
And as further reward
for your efforts,

45:28.720 --> 45:31.154
every one of you
will get the day off...

45:31.240 --> 45:32.912
(Excited murmurings)

45:33.000 --> 45:38.518
so you can be the guests of honour at
the MegaTunnel dedication ceremonies!

45:38.600 --> 45:41.034
(All cheering)

45:44.160 --> 45:46.196
Mandible! Mandible!

45:46.280 --> 45:50.717
(Chanting) Mandible!
Mandible! Mandible! Mandible!

45:54.160 --> 45:56.310
Now, bring me that soldier.

45:58.160 --> 46:01.038
(Chanting) Mandible! Mandible!

46:11.120 --> 46:12.917
(Yawns)

46:35.120 --> 46:39.193
(Gasps) Oh, my God! Z! Come here!

46:53.520 --> 46:55.033
It's Insectopia!

46:59.080 --> 47:02.117
You were right. It really is here.

47:13.600 --> 47:16.956
- Huh?
- All right. All right!

47:17.040 --> 47:19.076
- You're a genius.
- Let's eat.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.912
Mmph!

47:23.160 --> 47:24.991
Huh. (Nervous chuckle)

47:27.120 --> 47:28.838
(Muttering)

47:30.880 --> 47:33.519
Well? What's the problem?

47:33.600 --> 47:36.876
- There's some kind of force field.
- (Buzzing)

47:39.280 --> 47:43.796
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me!
How do you get in?

47:46.080 --> 47:49.834
Yes, well, I'm afraid
this is a private function.

47:49.920 --> 47:54.232
- Who are your friends, dear?
- Crawling insects, poopsie.

47:54.320 --> 47:57.312
Oh. The poor dears.

47:57.440 --> 48:00.591
(Slowly) Uh, good morning.

48:00.680 --> 48:03.478
- Huh?
- Darling, really.

48:03.600 --> 48:07.195
Greeting every insect
that emerges out of the grass?

48:07.280 --> 48:12.115
Pardon me!
I guess you don't recognise me!

48:13.400 --> 48:17.871
I've been travelling
and I'm all... schlumpy.

48:17.960 --> 48:19.871
I'm Princess Bala.

48:19.960 --> 48:24.636
Oh! It's even worse.
They're Eurotrash.

48:24.720 --> 48:28.395
Darling, they're poor.
They're dirty. They're smelly.

48:28.480 --> 48:30.914
We have to help them.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.073
If you'll just wait right here,
we'll fetch you a little something.

48:35.160 --> 48:38.391
Oh, please, Muffy.
Not another crusade.

48:38.480 --> 48:43.554
Chippie, we have a social obligation
to the less fortunate.

48:43.640 --> 48:47.758
I know you laugh at my hobbies,
but this is important to me!

48:47.840 --> 48:50.718
Mm. You have such a big heart.

48:50.800 --> 48:53.872
That's why you're
my little cuddly-widdles.

48:53.960 --> 48:58.795
Oh, my big, strong pheromone factory.

48:58.920 --> 49:00.717
- Mmm!
- Oh!

49:02.000 --> 49:04.833
Oh, brother.
Suddenly I've lost my appetite.

49:05.800 --> 49:07.279
- You know...
- Muffy...

49:07.400 --> 49:09.436
I guess I had imagined Insectopia...

49:10.800 --> 49:13.189
I don't know... a little differently.

49:18.400 --> 49:20.277
- Oh, Muffy!
- (Gasps)

49:20.360 --> 49:23.796
- No! Oh, no! (Sobbing)
- Oh, no.

49:23.880 --> 49:26.348
- Rumbling
- Look out!

49:30.560 --> 49:34.599
Z, help me! Z!

49:34.720 --> 49:37.712
Don't let me... Don't let me go, Z.

49:41.240 --> 49:43.959
Get me out of here!

49:48.240 --> 49:49.798
Bala!

49:56.440 --> 49:59.318
Whoa, this is not good.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.677
Whoa!

50:08.400 --> 50:11.551
Whoa-oa-oa!

50:16.080 --> 50:19.197
(Bala screaming)

50:41.360 --> 50:43.112
Whoa!

50:51.520 --> 50:52.999
Hi.

50:53.080 --> 50:54.593
(Both screaming)

50:56.800 --> 50:59.189
(Thud)

50:59.280 --> 51:01.430
- Z?
- Yes?

51:01.520 --> 51:06.753
It looks like this is it, just
when... I was starting to like you.

51:06.880 --> 51:08.711
(Both scream)

51:15.880 --> 51:17.996
Who the hell is that?

51:27.880 --> 51:29.313
Uhh!

51:30.600 --> 51:33.114
That's enough.

51:33.200 --> 51:36.237
I ain't tellin' you nothin'.

51:36.320 --> 51:40.711
Soldier, the princess is vital
to the future of this colony.

51:40.800 --> 51:44.475
She must be returned
to take her proper place as queen.

51:44.560 --> 51:46.755
We already have a queen.

51:46.880 --> 51:50.429
As for your friend Z,
why should I hurt him?

51:50.520 --> 51:52.431
(Chuckles) He's not important.

51:53.840 --> 51:55.671
Now, soldier,

51:55.760 --> 51:58.752
we all know that one individual ant
doesn't matter.

52:00.080 --> 52:01.832
Not you...

52:01.920 --> 52:03.956
- not Cutter...
- (Door opens)

52:04.040 --> 52:06.315
- (Azteca grunts)
- Not even her.

52:06.440 --> 52:08.590
Azteca! (Groaning)

52:08.680 --> 52:11.274
Don't tell that tight-ass! Aagh!

52:11.360 --> 52:13.430
- (Grunting)
- Where is Z?

52:13.520 --> 52:16.592
- I don't know where he is!
- Hmm.

52:16.680 --> 52:18.352
That's too bad.

52:22.360 --> 52:25.477
(Azteca groaning)

52:25.600 --> 52:27.079
Wait!

52:27.160 --> 52:28.639
Insectopia.

52:28.720 --> 52:32.349
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's where he'd be going.

52:32.440 --> 52:37.594
Soldier, you think this is a game?
Insectopia does not exist.

52:37.680 --> 52:39.318
As a matter of fact...

52:39.400 --> 52:40.879
it does.

52:40.960 --> 52:43.872
- Sir?
- I'll brief you on the co-ordinates.

52:43.960 --> 52:46.838
You're gonna bring
the princess back.

52:46.920 --> 52:49.115
And as for Z... Kill him.

52:50.200 --> 52:53.078
But you said he didn't matter.

52:53.160 --> 52:57.199
It's for the good of the colony.
You made the right decision.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.636
Gentlemen, now you can see...

53:00.760 --> 53:04.514
how dangerous individualism can be.

53:04.600 --> 53:07.433
It makes us... vulnerable.

53:08.760 --> 53:10.671
Let's go.

53:10.760 --> 53:12.637
(Door slams)

53:12.720 --> 53:16.554
Take him back to the MegaTunnel.
Put him on the front line.

53:18.040 --> 53:19.598
Dismissed.

53:27.360 --> 53:31.990
(Sighs) Jeez, what was I thinking?
I almost got you killed.

53:32.080 --> 53:35.755
Z, you know, you really
shouldn't be so hard on...

53:35.840 --> 53:39.719
(Straining) That's it.
I'm taking you back to the colony.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.712
- Uhh! Ow! Oh.
- Uhh!

53:42.800 --> 53:46.110
Insectopia.
You know, I must've been crazy.

53:46.200 --> 53:47.792
- Z?
- But you know what?

53:47.880 --> 53:49.836
- I admit it when I'm wrong.
- Z.

53:49.920 --> 53:53.708
And this time, I gotta tell ya,
I was absolutely, 100%...

53:54.720 --> 53:57.188
correct.

53:57.280 --> 54:02.673
Have... have you ever seen
anything more beautiful in your life?

54:02.760 --> 54:07.276
- It's... Insect...
- Shh! Don't jinx it. Come on!

54:15.880 --> 54:20.351
# I can see clearly now
the rain is gone

54:21.760 --> 54:23.591
(Burps)

54:23.680 --> 54:28.151
# I can see all obstacles in my way

54:30.240 --> 54:35.189
# Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind

54:35.280 --> 54:38.477
- (Ladybug) Pardon us.
- # It's gonna be a bright

54:38.560 --> 54:42.189
# (Bright, bright)
Bright sunshiny day

54:42.280 --> 54:45.829
- (Insects squealing)
- # It's gonna be a bright

54:45.920 --> 54:49.595
# (Bright, bright)
Bright sunshiny day

54:53.480 --> 54:58.838
# Look all around
nothing but blue skies

55:00.800 --> 55:03.758
# Look straight ahead nothing but

55:03.880 --> 55:08.908
# Blue skies

55:15.320 --> 55:17.117
# Whoa

55:17.200 --> 55:22.593
# I can see clearly now
the rain is gone

55:22.680 --> 55:24.557
(Buzzing)

55:24.640 --> 55:28.235
# I can see all obstacles in my way #

55:28.320 --> 55:31.551
All right, everybody.
I want all teams in place,

55:31.640 --> 55:34.837
fully prepared
to seal the doors here and here.

55:34.920 --> 55:38.390
'Make certain the digging crew
stays on schedule...

55:38.480 --> 55:42.359
'for breakthrough
midway in the dedication ceremony.

55:42.440 --> 55:45.159
'Now all we need is the princess.'

55:58.920 --> 56:00.911
(Sniffs) Mm.

56:12.080 --> 56:16.039
- This stuff tastes like crap.
- Really? Let me try some.

56:17.600 --> 56:21.878
Hey, it is crap. Not bad.

56:21.960 --> 56:25.999
- Somebody needs to feed that fire.
- Dude, I did it last time.

56:26.080 --> 56:28.719
I'm not gonna get it.
It's not my job.

56:28.800 --> 56:33.237
What about the new guy?
He hasn't contributed yet.

56:33.320 --> 56:37.199
And... (Sighs) You know,
he just died in my arms like that.

56:37.280 --> 56:41.956
I... You know, I don't think
he ever once in his life...

56:42.040 --> 56:43.951
made his own choice.

56:44.760 --> 56:47.718
I never knew it was like that.

56:47.800 --> 56:49.870
I mean, up in the palace...

56:49.960 --> 56:53.999
Well, I guess we just let the general
make all the decisions.

56:55.880 --> 57:00.237
Let me ask you something. What
made you come to the bar that night?

57:00.320 --> 57:03.835
I guess I was looking
for a little trouble.

57:03.920 --> 57:06.912
Well, (Chuckles)
trouble's my middle name.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.676
Actually, my middle name is Marion,
but... don't spread that around.

57:11.760 --> 57:14.877
You're pretty strange.
You do know that?

57:14.960 --> 57:18.396
Well... (Ahem) Strange
isn't the word I would use.

57:18.480 --> 57:21.278
I like it.
You're not like anyone else.

57:21.360 --> 57:26.195
Actually, now that you mention it,
there is a certain strangeness to me.

57:26.280 --> 57:30.910
I mean, it's, you know, kind of
a bizarre quality. Some said "freak".

57:31.000 --> 57:33.753
But it's, uh, you know, complimentary.

57:37.280 --> 57:38.872
Hey, new guy!

57:38.960 --> 57:40.712
We need more wood.

57:43.160 --> 57:46.277
I'll be right back.
Just hold that thought...

57:46.360 --> 57:49.318
whatever it is you were thinking.

57:49.400 --> 57:52.995
Hey, you ever wonder why
they call you guys "pests"?

57:53.080 --> 57:56.834
(Mosquito) What if, like,
we're just these tiny things...

57:56.920 --> 58:01.198
and we're just, like, part of
this whole other huge universe...

58:01.280 --> 58:04.590
that's, like, so big
we don't even know it exists?

58:04.720 --> 58:07.632
(Ladybug chuckles)
Man, that is so deep.

58:08.560 --> 58:10.994
Perfect.
Nothing like manual labour...

58:11.120 --> 58:13.998
on the most romantic night
of my life.

58:14.080 --> 58:15.911
(Buzzing)

58:18.480 --> 58:22.712
Hi. I was in the neighbourhood
and I thought I'd drop in.

58:24.280 --> 58:28.068
This is, uh, very bohemian.

58:28.160 --> 58:30.230
Aloha, dude. Welcome to Insec...

58:30.320 --> 58:32.550
- (Groans)
- (Insects gasp)

58:32.640 --> 58:36.189
Sorry for interrupting.

58:36.280 --> 58:40.910
You see, our princess has,
uh, gone missing,

58:41.000 --> 58:43.150
and we're just sick about it.

58:44.880 --> 58:48.429
She's about yea tall,
fairly easy on the eyes.

58:48.520 --> 58:51.717
- Anybody seen her?
- (All) That's her.

58:53.440 --> 58:56.910
Don't worry, Princess,
you'll be back home soon.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.231
Listen, Cutter, I'm...
I'm not going back.

59:00.320 --> 59:03.756
(Sighs) The thing is, Princess,
I got orders.

59:03.840 --> 59:07.879
Orders? Can't you just once
think for yourself?

59:09.400 --> 59:12.949
Well, that was very impressive.
Where's Z?

59:14.160 --> 59:16.390
- Z? He's, uh...
- Dead.

59:17.680 --> 59:21.195
Z's dead.
You don't need to worry about him.

59:21.280 --> 59:26.035
Z's dead.
Well, he was an ant with ideas.

59:26.120 --> 59:27.872
Too bad for him.

59:27.960 --> 59:30.599
Princess, your colony needs you.

59:30.680 --> 59:32.796
- (Grunting)
- (Bala) Cutter!

59:32.880 --> 59:35.952
- Stop right now! Let go of me!
- Bala!

59:36.080 --> 59:37.957
Stop, you...

59:38.040 --> 59:39.439
Oh, no.

59:39.520 --> 59:42.273
(Muttering) What am I gonna do?

59:42.360 --> 59:45.557
All right, look.
Let's be rational about this.

59:45.640 --> 59:48.552
You know, Bala and I,
she's a princess...

59:48.640 --> 59:51.791
and I'm a...
I'm a soil-relocation engineer.

59:51.880 --> 59:55.156
So... You know...
On the other hand, uh...

59:55.240 --> 59:57.959
I've gotta go back for her.

59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.958
(Chippie, drunk)
I'll... give you a lift.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.157
Sss... Whoa! Ohh!

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.435
It's the least I can do.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:11.958
Besides... it's what my waddly-kiddles
would want.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.156
(Sniffling and sobbing)

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.118
Uh, look, how about
a cup of joe...?

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:21.034
- Well, old boy... saddle up.
- I saw a puddle of coffee there.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.475
It... Whoa!

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.437
(Both groaning)

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.117
(Z) Look out!

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.834
(Bala grunting)

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.115
Ah, Princess.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.636
- You're just in time.
- Take your hands off me!

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.188
General, what is going on here?

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:46.159
- I DEMAND an explanation.
- I'll explain... afterwards.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.198
- Is the south-east entrance secure?
- Yes, sir.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.077
Not afterwards. Now.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.793
I don't like the way you think
or the way you run this colony.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.111
And I don't like you.
The wedding is off.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:06.273
- Things are going to change here.
- You're right, Princess.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:10.353
Things are going to change.
Make her more comfortable.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.069
- (Gasps)
- She'll be here for a while.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:18.073
What do you think you're doing?
My mother will have your head.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:23.154
I doubt that. (Chuckles) Ah, you've
got a fighter spirit, Bala.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:26.152
Just what we need
to start our new colony.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.152
We'll rinse away
the filth from our gutters.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.471
We'll start anew,
with you by my side as my queen.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.551
You're crazy.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.877
I believe history
will see things differently.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.032
All right, gentlemen.
Take your positions.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.634
Someday... someday you'll thank me.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.633
(Chippie and Z moaning)

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.632
(Z) Pull up! Pull up!
Aah! There it is!

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.836
(Chippie mutters and hiccups)

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.235
Oof! (Coughs) Oh!

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.552
Well, then, go get
the woman you love, Z.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.949
So long, Chip. And thanks.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.518
You there.
Where do you think you're goin'?

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.194
Me? Oh, no, I was just...
You know, I...

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.316
You're not supposed to be here.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.279
Workers are to report
to the tunnel-opening ceremonies.

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:31.798
Yes, yes, of course. Well, I should
get going, then. I... (Ahem)

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.552
You know, the-the...

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:34.834
(Soldier) Hey!

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.957
- I'm going to the... the t-tunnel...

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.871
- Get moving.
- Better get...

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.475
I'm going to the
tunnel-opening ceremonies...

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.360
Excuse me, please.
Tunnel-opening ceremonies.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.318
- Hey!
- Opening the tunnel. They need me.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.960
- I'm the key man.
- Where are you going?

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.235
Tunnel-opening ceremonies.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:01.071
- (Crashing)
- (Bala) Hey! Let me outta here!

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.593
Hey!

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.959
Gosh, this-this day just keeps
getting better and better.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.514
(Bala shouting in distance)

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:19.953
(Bala) Are you listening to me
out there? I'm the princess!

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.837
Damn it!

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.590
- Wow, your manners haven't improved.
- Z!

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.035
(Gasps) Whoa! Whoa!

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.192
- (Gasps) Ooh!
- It's you. You came back for me.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.876
Well, yeah, I came back for you.
I have strong feelings for you.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:42.839
Let's face it, you're... you're...
you're beautiful...

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.913
A little combative at times,
but I think we can work on that.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.592
You talk too much.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:55.278
Gee, I think I'm about to become
the strong, silent type.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.479
Come on. The city's deserted.
We'd better get outta here.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:03.552
Z... (Sighs) We can't go.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:07.235
Mandible's insane.
He... he keeps talking about...

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.154
washing away the filth
and-and changing history and...

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:14.357
and I think he's going to try
to kill my mother.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.193
(Z) Not just your mother... everyone.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.430
- What's going on?
- Look.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.476
Here we are, safe in the city.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.393
But they're gonna seal
everybody off in the MegaTunnel.

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.436
And... here's the lake.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.875
You're right.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.155
We can't leave now.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.310
Come on. We gotta get down there.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.756
Today is the realisation of a dream.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.070
A dream of a proud colony.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:44.233
A pure colony. A colony reborn.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.356
(Cheering)

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:51.916
Moments from now
this tunnel will open.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.834
The past will be washed away
and a new day will dawn.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.876
(Cheering)

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.951
A stirring speech, General.

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.237
I wish my daughter
were here to appreciate it.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.233
Your Majesty, I know
how concerned you are about Bala.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.788
But my scouts
are on her trail and...

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.713
I don't want to discuss it.
Just find her.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.155
I will, Your Highness.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.031
Goodbye.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.437
(Soldiers talking)

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.071
(Ants chattering)

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.279
Seal up the doors.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:39.797
- Cutter, did you hear me?
- Sir, I've been thinking.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:44.158
Do we need to do this?
Look at what these workers have done.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.869
They got the right stuff.
Isn't there any other way?

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.076
Cutter, you're a fine officer.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.993
You have discipline,
courage, ability.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:57.596
But you seem to have a weakness for
the lower orders I find disturbing.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.195
- Now, are you with me?
- Sir, uh... I apologise.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.192
- All right, then. Seal it up.
- Yes, sir.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.432
(Grunting)

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.910
(Queen) As I look out
on this magnificent tunnel,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.070
I am filled with pride.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.958
- (Z) Jump!
- In these difficult times,

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:28.510
it is a great solace to know
that you, our workers...

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.909
- (Queen continues)
- Mom! Wait!

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.278
Every worker in the colony is here.
Hey, that guy owes me money.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:39.831
(Queen) This tremendous
accomplishment is a testimony to...

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:43.879
Go warn your mother.
I've gotta get to those diggers.

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:47.839
- There's not enough time.
- Leave the pessimism to me, OK?

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.751
- (Queen continuing)
- Ow!

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.398
- Ooh!
- Yeeow!

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:53.948
Excuse me! Sorry. Excuse me.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.157
When our expert diggers
break through to the surface...

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.595
- Mom! Stop!
- The sun will pour in...

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.717
Bala! Where've you been?
Are you all right?

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.950
- I'm fine.
- What happened?

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.640
Mother, we're in terrible danger.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.872
(Panting)

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.837
(Sighs)

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.309
Put your backs into it, people!

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:24.039
Wait! Hold... Hey, stop digging!

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.270
- Z? Is that you?
- We must stop!

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.635
- Z! You're back!
- (Bones crunch)

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.870
- Oh, Z! Oh.
- (Gasping) Weaver!

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.997
Z! What's the matter?

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:37.311
H-hold up, everyone.
Stop! Stop digging.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.960
- On whose authority?
- Your own authority.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.156
If you break through, we'll...

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.549
Drown. This tunnel is going to flood.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.790
We've got to get everyone out.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.791
(All murmuring)

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.395
Look, I got orders,
and those orders say "dig".

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.870
What if someone ordered you
to jump off a bridge?

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.714
Oh, I'm asking the wrong guy here.
Look, think for yourselves!

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:03.553
Gimme that!
I've had enough out of you.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.596
Get back to work.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.910
(Weaver) What's that noise?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.115
Uh-oh.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.916
- Let's get outta here!
- Run!

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.797
(All screaming)

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:17.189
(Weaver) Run! Keep going!

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:20.875
Everyone, listen to me.
We've all been deceived.

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:25.118
We need to calmly
head toward the exits.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:28.397
- Run for your lives! Flood!
- No. Don't panic.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:31.676
- Don't panic!
- Every ant for himself!

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.636
(Gasps)

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.676
(All screaming)

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.675
All the exits are blocked!

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.711
- What do we do?
- There's nothing we can do!

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.353
Yes, there is.
Weaver, give me a leg up.

01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:21.352
Everyone, listen to me!

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:23.908
- Who the heck are you?
- He's Z!

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.276
(All murmuring)

01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:31.478
Listen, we gotta help each other
get out before we all drown.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.755
- How?
- By making a ladder.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.033
A ladder!

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.872
Hey, if we built this,
we can do anything.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.191
- OK, let's move it!
- All of you, gather round.

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:42.837
You, start climbing.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.029
- Grab my arm.
- All right. Here I go.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.475
- Go, go, go!
- Right!

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.430
- Excuse me, Your Majesty.
- (Grunting)

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.199
Z, I've gotta help my Mom.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:01.068
Don't worry. I know almost
exactly what I'm doing.

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.471
I'll see you at the top.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.557
(Mandible) Gentlemen,
there comes a time...

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.790
in the evolution of a colony...

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:17.668
when the strong are meant
to rise above the weak.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.156
Now is that time.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.708
'Below us right now,

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.758
'the weak elements of the colony...

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.308
'are being washed away.'

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.956
Oh, God, we're not gonna make it.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.316
- We need more ants.
- You two better get up there.

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.630
Weaver, you can't hold it alone.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.870
Get going.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.791
Hang in there, buddy.

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.034
- Got it!
- Hurry up! Go, go, go, go!

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.712
(Gasps)

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.996
Our princess is secure,
and a glorious future is at hand.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.951
We can all stand proud.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.838
It is time for a new beginning.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.798
- (Soldiers gasp)
- What the hell is that?

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.235
I think that's the weak element, sir.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:31.199
- Gimme... gimme a hand!
- Z! You?

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.717
Let go! Don't you understand?
It's for the good of the colony!

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.156
Wha-what are you saying?
We are the colony!

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.796
(Soldiers gasp)

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.280
Cutter... what are you doing?

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.477
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:51.154
This is for the good
of the colony, sir.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.670
You useless, ungrateful maggot!

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.591
I am the colony!

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.240
- Look out!
- Oof!

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.276
(Screaming)

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.508
Z!

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.677
Men, let's move it!
Get these ants up here.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.312
- Keep it moving.
- Thank goodness we made it.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.277
Wait here.

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.358
- Uhh! OK.
- Thank you.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.072
Weaver.

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.512
Where's Z?

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:51.634
Oh, no.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.598
(Weaver) Back up, everybody, back up!

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:58.468
- Give him some air. Back up.
- Z, oh, Z.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.958
Please wake up.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.438
Oh, no...

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.958
(Inhales)

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.195
Huh?! (Coughing)

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.517
(All cheering)

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.757
Yowch!

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.794
You know, Weaver,
you still owe me that dinner.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.753
- (Kissing)
- Babylove.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.549
- We made it, Z!
- You da ant!

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.596
- Eh!
- You did it.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.716
We did it.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.995
- Oh!
- Fellas! Fellas, please!

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.913
- This is very embarrassing!
- (Laughing)

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.470
On the other hand,
I probably could get used to this.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:54.396
(Z) 'There you have it,
your average "boy meets girl,

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.712
'"boy likes girl, boy changes
underlying social order" story.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.190
'So what else can I tell you?
We rebuilt the colony.

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.195
'It's even better than before cos now
it has a large indoor swimming pool.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:10.431
'Bala and I are thinking
of starting a family.

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:14.513
'You know, just a few kids...
maybe a million to begin with.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:19.071
'I'm workin' with a new therapist,
you know, absolutely terrific.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:23.631
'He's putting me in touch with my
inner maggot, which is helping me.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.871
'And I finally feel like
I've found my place.

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.396
'And you know what?
It's right back where I started.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:33.631
'But the difference is,
this time I chose it.'

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.393
# Just what makes that little old ant

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:44.552
# Think he'll move
that rubber tree plant

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:49.515
# Anyone knows an ant
can't move a rubber tree plant

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.990
# But he's got high hopes

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.998
# He's got high hopes

01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.712
# He's got high apple pie
in the sky hopes

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:04.268
# So anytime you're gettin' low

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:08.831
# 'Stead of lettin' go
just remember that ant

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:11.957
# Oops, there goes
another rubber tree plant

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.958

another rubber tree plant)

# Oops, there goes
another rubber tree plant

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:24.037
# Once there was a silly old ram

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.918
# Thought he'd punch a hole in a dam

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.197
# No one could make that ram scram

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.872
# He kept buttin' that dam

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.191
# Cos he had high hopes

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.238
# He had high hopes

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.872
# He had high apple pie
in the sky hopes

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.033
# So anytime you're feelin' bad
'stead of feelin' sad

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.953
# Just remember that ram

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.873
# (Oops, there goes
a billion-kilowatt dam)

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:56.952

a billion-kilowatt dam

# Keep those high apple pie
in the sky hopes

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.434
# A problem's just a toy balloon

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:20.991
# They'll be bursting soon
they're just bound to go pop

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:24.117

Ker-plop
