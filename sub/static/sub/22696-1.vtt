SHOWBOX presents

00:42.783 --> 00:45.283
a S.I.G FILM / BARUNSON E&A production

00:54.993 --> 00:56.530
Hey, Sung Hoon.

01:10.168 --> 01:12.138
What's up?

01:14.252 --> 01:15.877
I'm still in law school.

01:57.092 --> 02:00.549
They're all born with silver spoons
in their mouths, except me.

02:33.648 --> 02:36.983
Anyway, next Friday…

02:39.493 --> 02:41.846
Hey, I'll call you back.

02:56.572 --> 02:58.780
- Let's get out of here!
- Wait up!

03:03.522 --> 03:04.576
Mom!

03:05.076 --> 03:06.076
Mom!

03:07.665 --> 03:08.988
Wake up!

03:09.221 --> 03:10.263
Mom!

03:11.075 --> 03:12.368
Wake up, Mom!

03:14.961 --> 03:15.918
Stay with me!

03:15.943 --> 03:16.943
Mom!

03:17.327 --> 03:18.327
No!

03:39.469 --> 03:41.327
Hold on, Mom!

03:47.068 --> 03:48.320
Taxi!

04:29.384 --> 04:30.673
Mom!

04:36.450 --> 04:37.575
Mom!

04:46.774 --> 04:48.539
No!

05:06.993 --> 05:11.533
RV: RESURRECTED VICTIMS

05:14.041 --> 05:15.334
7 YEARS LATER

05:16.125 --> 05:18.324
Thus, the prosecution seeks…

05:18.450 --> 05:21.575
the death penalty for the defendant.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.665
The court is adjourned.

05:30.908 --> 05:34.118
The sentencing will be
given on September 15th.

05:37.493 --> 05:38.658
I thought we had a deal!

05:39.325 --> 05:41.033
I told you he's my cousin!

05:41.575 --> 05:42.993
How could you do that?

05:44.575 --> 05:46.368
I asked for due punishment.

05:47.408 --> 05:49.033
The rest is up to the judge.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.149
Hey.

05:53.493 --> 05:56.783
What about the victim's family?

06:02.368 --> 06:05.493
He'll support the kids
till they go to college.

06:05.533 --> 06:09.950
And my client is repentant of his actions.

06:17.868 --> 06:19.325
To the victim's family…

06:21.450 --> 06:25.993
paying for the crime means
more than just money.

06:42.033 --> 06:44.533
Do you recall the mother

06:44.575 --> 06:49.118
who died in a motorcycle
robbery 7 years ago?

06:49.658 --> 06:54.618
The victim's son is now a prosecutor.

06:54.658 --> 07:00.033
In the trial of a man who killed a couple
and burned their house,

07:00.075 --> 07:04.533
he asked for the rare death sentence.

07:10.283 --> 07:12.658
SISTER
Missed Call (11)

07:14.368 --> 07:15.658
SISTER

07:18.158 --> 07:20.993
I'll call you after work.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.682
Where are you?

07:24.408 --> 07:26.283
Coming out of a trial. Why?

07:27.118 --> 07:29.368
Come home right now!

07:32.158 --> 07:33.533
Why? What's wrong?

07:34.243 --> 07:35.325
Jin-Hong…

07:36.493 --> 07:37.783
Mom is back.

07:40.283 --> 07:41.283
What?

07:42.033 --> 07:43.908
Mom came back!

07:44.317 --> 07:48.274
She's watching TV with me now!

07:48.299 --> 07:50.464
Is your husband home?

07:52.232 --> 07:54.450
She can't sleep without pills.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.243
She should be hospitalized again.

07:58.455 --> 08:00.665
You try convincing her to go.

08:20.835 --> 08:21.950
Hee-Jung!

08:27.563 --> 08:29.438
That's crazy!

08:32.751 --> 08:34.789
He's hilarious!

08:46.393 --> 08:48.308
Jin-Hong? You're home?

08:48.866 --> 08:50.616
- Mom, it's Jin-Hong.
- Hi.

08:51.925 --> 08:53.546
Who are you?

09:10.060 --> 09:11.853
You must be hungry.

09:14.936 --> 09:17.343
I told you to change first!

09:17.518 --> 09:19.268
But he's hungry.

09:26.096 --> 09:27.721
Hee-Jung!

09:28.086 --> 09:29.961
Hi, Jin-Hong.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.625
- Pastor!
- What?

09:32.135 --> 09:33.552
Deaconess Choi is back?

09:34.450 --> 09:35.993
Did you have a nightmare again?

09:36.903 --> 09:38.111
Welcome.

09:42.121 --> 09:43.968
How can this be!

09:46.496 --> 09:48.788
- Oh Lord!
- Oh Jesus!

09:49.163 --> 09:56.206
"God raised him from the dead,
freeing him from the agony of death…"

09:56.620 --> 09:57.995
Amen!

09:58.020 --> 09:59.020
Amen!

09:59.301 --> 10:01.633
Let us praise God together!

10:01.773 --> 10:06.533
There's a land that is fairer than day

10:07.253 --> 10:11.003
And by faith we can see it afar

10:12.243 --> 10:15.243
For the Father waits over the way

10:16.207 --> 10:17.825
Hee-Jung?

10:25.699 --> 10:27.114
Mom passed away.

10:29.390 --> 10:30.808
I know!

10:30.832 --> 10:32.832
And now she's back!

10:44.586 --> 10:45.754
Deaconess?

10:46.033 --> 10:48.908
Did you meet Jesus?

10:48.996 --> 10:52.246
Is heaven really beautiful?

10:52.271 --> 10:56.228
Did God entrust you with judgment?

10:57.483 --> 10:59.026
Judgment…

11:05.026 --> 11:06.111
Rane…

11:09.925 --> 11:10.925
Kama…

11:23.434 --> 11:25.008
What's happening?

11:30.708 --> 11:31.958
- Mom?
- Hee-Jung.

11:32.427 --> 11:33.760
- Hee-Jung!
- Mom!

11:34.584 --> 11:35.584
Sis…

11:45.376 --> 11:46.663
Mom!

11:46.688 --> 11:48.341
- Mom!
- Let me go!

11:55.273 --> 11:57.273
What's with you!

12:04.886 --> 12:05.886
Jin-Hong!

12:06.641 --> 12:07.641
Hold her!

12:12.618 --> 12:13.618
Mom!

12:24.805 --> 12:26.180
Mom!

12:28.568 --> 12:30.276
Jin-Hong! What do we do?

12:31.605 --> 12:33.395
Mom! Are you okay?

12:34.922 --> 12:36.422
You'll be alright.

12:38.835 --> 12:40.402
You called the cops?

12:40.427 --> 12:41.427
No, 911.

13:12.326 --> 13:13.326
Why is she here?

13:13.451 --> 13:15.951
The police were notified first.
We had no choice.

13:24.609 --> 13:25.777
Reflexes, normal.

13:25.865 --> 13:26.990
Vital signs, normal.

13:29.337 --> 13:30.795
Normal sensory processing.

13:30.999 --> 13:34.124
The first resurrected
victim appeared in the U.S.

13:36.093 --> 13:39.508
This file was released by the CIA

13:39.596 --> 13:42.471
to intelligence agencies around the world.

13:43.108 --> 13:46.358
He took me to his place that day.

13:46.987 --> 13:49.070
And he did a bad thing to me.

13:49.548 --> 13:52.216
Then he strangled me to hide the truth.

13:53.591 --> 13:56.049
I came back to make justice…

13:56.361 --> 13:58.654
There will be more people like me…

13:58.679 --> 14:01.096
coming back to life for the same reason.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.008
Also, in Macau,

14:04.468 --> 14:06.968
when a serial killer couldn't be caught,

14:07.286 --> 14:12.201
5 women appeared
and claimed to be the lost victims.

14:12.701 --> 14:16.743
2 of them even explained
where their bodies were buried.

14:22.941 --> 14:29.398
Later, the killer bled to death
after the women attacked him.

14:30.676 --> 14:36.843
Just like Roberta Oswald,
the women got their revenge.

14:37.288 --> 14:40.578
Then they burst into flames and vanished.

14:41.176 --> 14:44.718
Intelligence around the world has confirmed

14:45.093 --> 14:51.425
the resurrected appear when culprits
were not properly punished by law.

14:51.902 --> 14:56.110
Eyewitness accounts on the
Internet are calling them

14:56.215 --> 15:00.298
Resurrected Victims, or RV.

15:04.303 --> 15:07.968
Here is the first RV in
Korea, Choi Myung-sook.

15:08.596 --> 15:11.950
She died in a motorcycle robbery in 2008.

15:12.516 --> 15:16.348
7 years after her death,
she appeared at her home today.

15:16.979 --> 15:20.522
Then she attacked her son,
Prosecutor Seo Jin-Hong.

15:26.624 --> 15:27.624
Thus

15:27.763 --> 15:33.848
to prevent the spread of public panic
from this case,

15:33.913 --> 15:38.908
the NIS will conduct an investigation controlling
the media and all eyewitness accounts.

15:48.383 --> 15:51.425
The world is full of surprises.

15:53.675 --> 15:56.675
Take a leave of absence if you need to.

15:58.925 --> 15:59.925
Yes, sir.

16:00.284 --> 16:01.742
Don't worry.

16:01.800 --> 16:05.718
We're the only ones in Korea
who have the right to prosecute.

16:12.675 --> 16:16.343
Intelligence is in charge here.
Come to headquarters.

16:16.383 --> 16:17.383
Yes, sir.

16:20.633 --> 16:25.883
She majored in criminal psychology
in the U.S. after the police academy.

16:29.093 --> 16:30.650
What happened?

16:30.675 --> 16:31.675
No idea.

16:39.675 --> 16:41.025
Tell me.

16:41.050 --> 16:43.258
How many resurrected victims are there?

16:45.383 --> 16:50.675
At present, intelligence agencies
have counted 89 in total.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.550
Of course, she's the first in Korea.

16:55.008 --> 16:56.925
How many are still alive?

17:00.008 --> 17:06.633
All RVs have gotten their
revenge then vanished.

17:10.300 --> 17:15.133
There was a time when police chiefs
called young prosecutors 'sirs'

17:15.175 --> 17:18.800
and got slapped in front of their juniors.

17:18.843 --> 17:19.843
Close the door.

17:24.633 --> 17:30.218
Our commissioner wants to get
independent investigation rights

17:31.050 --> 17:35.508
from the prosecution before
the end of his term.

17:41.133 --> 17:43.300
This prosecutor was on the news today.

17:44.050 --> 17:46.675
- For seeking the death sentence.
- Right.

17:48.425 --> 17:51.383
His mother died in a motorcycle
robbery 7 years ago.

17:53.883 --> 17:56.175
Why reinvestigate her case?

17:58.008 --> 18:00.925
His mother came back to life.

18:03.175 --> 18:04.175
Pardon?

18:05.718 --> 18:08.383
Ever heard of RV?

18:09.093 --> 18:16.425
The dead mother appeared
and tried to attack her son.

18:17.508 --> 18:20.468
Which means she pointed
him out as the killer.

18:22.925 --> 18:28.218
I'll share necessary information with you
because you're a prosecutor.

18:28.718 --> 18:31.258
Things may get uncomfortable
for you, Prosecutor Seo.

18:32.425 --> 18:36.758
As soon as you became a prosecutor,
you took all her case files.

18:38.883 --> 18:41.133
I couldn't trust the investigation.

18:42.843 --> 18:46.133
Could you explain in detail?

18:48.097 --> 18:49.722
First…

18:49.834 --> 18:54.627
the case was filled with discrepancies.

18:56.508 --> 18:59.675
Based on CCTV footage,
the police said there was 1 culprit.

19:00.468 --> 19:06.843
They indicted an ex-convict who matched
the DNA found on Mom's hand.

19:09.159 --> 19:13.201
But the witness I found
said there were 2 culprits.

19:13.643 --> 19:20.468
And the descriptions
were different from the ex-convict.

19:22.352 --> 19:25.102
I also tracked down the motorcycle.

19:26.133 --> 19:29.968
The culprit must be
a wanted Chinese criminal.

19:30.008 --> 19:32.093
Many folks like that come here.

19:32.419 --> 19:34.211
He paid by credit card.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.865
He used a duplicated card from Chinatown.

19:37.252 --> 19:40.252
And the witness said he
had a Chinese accent.

19:41.363 --> 19:44.758
He was a three-time motorcycle thief.

19:44.942 --> 19:48.110
He turned up dead 45 days
later at the Han River.

19:48.925 --> 19:51.258
They estimated he died
about a month before.

19:51.546 --> 19:54.379
The DNA matched,
so they concluded he was the killer.

19:55.979 --> 19:57.501
Why'd Seo reinvestigate?

19:57.700 --> 20:01.093
If he were the real culprit
he would have had a Chinese accent.

20:01.150 --> 20:04.650
But he didn't. So Seo requested
that police reinvestigate.

20:04.875 --> 20:09.500
Then he checked out records
of people who left for China.

20:09.543 --> 20:14.625
He also asked Interpol for a list
of wanted Chinese criminals.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.625
But something is odd.

20:17.293 --> 20:18.293
What is it?

20:18.793 --> 20:22.958
Seo was the sole beneficiary
of his mother's $500K insurance.

20:25.583 --> 20:31.293
It could've easily been his salary
if he went to a law firm.

20:33.043 --> 20:35.250
He killed his mom for the insurance?

20:35.708 --> 20:37.125
That's too obvious.

20:38.875 --> 20:41.333
One odd thing about criminals,

20:42.583 --> 20:47.418
they always return to the crime scene.

20:49.543 --> 20:53.333
Seo could've taken the case files
for similar reasons.

20:54.958 --> 20:59.375
Check on the insurance, CCTV files,
and eyewitness statements.

20:59.418 --> 21:02.793
Get me Seo's alibi
and call history for that day, too.

21:04.168 --> 21:05.333
Yes, Chief.

21:09.250 --> 21:12.625
The son killed his mother?

21:25.500 --> 21:26.500
Ouch!

21:31.083 --> 21:32.668
Did you burn yourself?

21:33.083 --> 21:34.083
Yes.

21:34.708 --> 21:36.208
Could you get me a bandaid?

21:38.793 --> 21:41.543
I get good food at the law school.

21:41.583 --> 21:43.793
I have nowhere to put what you make.

21:46.557 --> 21:47.557
Here.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.543
Can't you wire the money?

21:52.333 --> 21:56.250
I'll bring it to you later
along with the food.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.333
But eating out is okay.

22:02.168 --> 22:03.418
Take an umbrella!

23:11.293 --> 23:13.793
Why did you ignore me!

23:33.181 --> 23:34.181
Hee-Jung?

23:34.206 --> 23:35.249
Hi, Jin-Hong.

23:35.274 --> 23:38.399
Why didn't you call? Is Mom okay?

23:38.424 --> 23:39.424
What?

23:39.827 --> 23:41.577
She'll be out soon, right?

23:42.500 --> 23:45.543
We're planning on taking her to Thailand.

23:50.668 --> 23:52.208
What in the world?

23:53.757 --> 23:56.502
We got disconnected?

23:57.459 --> 24:00.001
Why is the reception weak in here?

24:02.267 --> 24:03.267
Hee-Jung!

24:03.770 --> 24:05.895
Come to your senses!

24:07.700 --> 24:10.368
Mom kept saying in my dreams…

24:11.158 --> 24:12.868
"Keep my things."

24:12.908 --> 24:14.493
She said she'd be back.

24:15.033 --> 24:18.993
I honestly can't believe
she came back from the dead.

24:19.450 --> 24:20.533
Why not?

24:21.243 --> 24:23.368
You saw the video I took!

24:23.408 --> 24:25.450
That's why we're going to Thailand!

24:35.450 --> 24:39.283
She has no metabolism.

24:39.595 --> 24:44.888
And her brainwaves are weak,
as if in a comatose state.

24:53.783 --> 24:58.783
Perhaps some supernatural power
is judging humans.

25:01.283 --> 25:04.908
If humans do not pay for
their crimes justly,

25:04.950 --> 25:09.200
it's as if God steps in and
punishes them instead.

25:10.075 --> 25:12.993
If the world finds out about this,

25:14.450 --> 25:16.993
there will be sheer chaos.

25:17.618 --> 25:22.658
I found over 100 clips
on RV on the Internet.

25:23.353 --> 25:25.436
You think you can keep hiding it?

25:27.743 --> 25:31.033
Then how many UFO clips are there?

25:32.575 --> 25:38.450
If we reveal Choi Myung-sook's case,

25:38.770 --> 25:42.645
things will get awkward for you.

25:43.325 --> 25:48.618
RVs have never been wrong
in their targets for revenge.

25:49.825 --> 25:51.533
Have any failed?

25:56.243 --> 26:00.325
How many RVs have appeared exactly?

26:00.368 --> 26:03.993
How can you be sure that
all of them got revenge?

26:06.243 --> 26:10.700
She tried to attack me,
but she didn't hurt me.

26:15.417 --> 26:19.667
We must catch the real culprit this time.

26:21.493 --> 26:27.783
If what you say is true,
her killer must still be alive.

26:31.408 --> 26:32.200
Prosecutor!

26:32.243 --> 26:33.243
The killer is back.

26:34.521 --> 26:39.825
Check on any Korean-Chinese
who left 7 years ago and returned.

26:39.868 --> 26:40.868
Quickly, please.

26:41.725 --> 26:42.807
Yes, sir.

26:43.237 --> 26:46.447
There was a strange call for you
after you left yesterday.

26:47.404 --> 26:48.111
From whom?

26:48.136 --> 26:51.926
He said he knew your mother
and must speak to you.

26:53.598 --> 26:55.805
Track down where the call came from.

26:56.408 --> 26:57.408
Yes, sir.

27:04.614 --> 27:05.656
Do you remember

27:06.138 --> 27:09.720
the top high school student
who stabbed his mother to death?

27:09.745 --> 27:12.910
Where the mom fought him
off with a golf club?

27:16.658 --> 27:23.118
She was very strong to have fought
while being stabbed so many times.

27:25.908 --> 27:32.618
Since her husband died young,
her only hope must've been her son.

27:33.789 --> 27:35.452
I guess.

27:37.218 --> 27:40.468
Then why'd he kill his mom?

27:42.575 --> 27:43.743
Who is it?

27:49.326 --> 27:51.286
Are you Prosecutor Seo's sister?

27:52.568 --> 27:53.568
Yes.

27:57.371 --> 27:58.706
Please have a seat.

27:59.708 --> 28:02.043
Your mother looks lovely.

28:03.168 --> 28:05.168
Dad died when I was 7.

28:05.793 --> 28:10.333
Mom even drove a truck to support us.

28:10.833 --> 28:15.043
Even when Jin-Hong passed the bar,
she worked in a kitchen.

28:15.750 --> 28:17.043
She's amazing.

28:20.418 --> 28:27.418
She said Jin-Hong shouldn't
accept bribes just to support her.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.000
She even paid expensive insurance premiums…

28:35.625 --> 28:43.043
The report says you filmed
her with your phone.

28:45.333 --> 28:47.208
Didn't Jin-Hong tell you?

28:49.458 --> 28:50.500
No.

28:53.833 --> 28:59.875
Intelligence agents were just here.
They took everything.

29:05.125 --> 29:07.208
They told me not to say anything.

29:09.833 --> 29:11.250
Oh no.

29:14.793 --> 29:17.333
When did he start working out?

29:17.958 --> 29:22.293
Prosecutors tend to be heavy drinkers.

29:22.708 --> 29:26.208
But I heard your brother
doesn't drink at all.

29:26.750 --> 29:29.668
Was your mom very strict with him?

29:33.168 --> 29:35.458
Me taking psychiatric drugs…

29:36.750 --> 29:39.833
and Jin-Hong not drinking are the same.

29:41.208 --> 29:42.208
Pardon?

29:43.625 --> 29:49.168
Mom loved Jin-Hong more than life itself!

29:49.835 --> 29:56.085
Thinking Mom died because of him!
How could he drink!

30:03.043 --> 30:04.043
What is it?

30:05.708 --> 30:06.793
Bad reception?

30:08.793 --> 30:10.250
It's good in the bathroom.

30:13.833 --> 30:14.833
Over there.

30:18.293 --> 30:20.333
Seo is quickly on the move.

30:20.375 --> 30:23.750
He's going around with his investigator.

30:24.250 --> 30:25.293
Really?

30:26.583 --> 30:29.750
He's on the Chinese criminals
wanted list you gave me.

30:29.793 --> 30:31.250
His name's Li Chingchung.

30:31.293 --> 30:35.918
He left in 2008 and recently returned
with a fake passport.

30:35.958 --> 30:36.958
This way.

30:59.686 --> 31:00.893
He's Prosecutor Seo.

31:00.918 --> 31:02.958
- You're sure it's Li Chingchung?
- Pay up first.

31:07.833 --> 31:10.418
He exchanged the money and left
the day after she died.

31:17.958 --> 31:21.043
He doesn't leave his pad, eh.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.750
Gets what he needs delivered, eh.

32:00.256 --> 32:01.256
Chief!

32:01.271 --> 32:03.271
Seo caught on that we're tailing him.

32:03.793 --> 32:06.500
Our men lost him in Chinatown.

32:08.125 --> 32:09.958
Find out why he went there.

32:10.725 --> 32:12.265
Yes, Chief.

32:23.102 --> 32:24.520
The first bullet will be a dud.

32:24.545 --> 32:28.045
To shoot again, pull this to reload.

33:03.493 --> 33:05.019
Postal delivery!

33:07.131 --> 33:08.508
Hello?

33:08.869 --> 33:09.869
Who is it?

33:10.344 --> 33:12.719
I need a signature for the delivery.

33:18.968 --> 33:20.843
Please sign here.

33:21.633 --> 33:22.633
Okay.

33:29.550 --> 33:30.843
HELP ME

33:33.258 --> 33:36.883
The box is big. Could you open the door?

33:39.800 --> 33:41.691
Just leave it and go.

33:42.015 --> 33:43.765
Okay then.

33:50.783 --> 33:52.158
She's held captive, sir.

33:52.664 --> 33:54.168
Really?

34:03.008 --> 34:04.008
Run!

34:20.141 --> 34:21.974
Who are you? Wanna die?

34:43.132 --> 34:44.717
He's on the run! Hurry!

35:04.025 --> 35:05.329
What?

37:11.050 --> 37:12.435
Hurry!

37:22.234 --> 37:24.274
You have the right to remain silent.

37:24.299 --> 37:26.839
Anything you say can be
used against you in court.

37:27.358 --> 37:28.233
Got that?

37:28.258 --> 37:29.258
Screw you!

37:29.383 --> 37:30.383
Get in, fool!

37:59.425 --> 38:00.425
Nice to meet you

38:00.430 --> 38:01.430
Welcome.

38:03.194 --> 38:05.987
What the RVs in Macau said, "RANEKAMA"…

38:06.559 --> 38:09.434
It means 'For Revenge' in ancient Hebrew.

38:09.933 --> 38:13.105
Furthermore, the revenge
of RVs occurs only

38:13.130 --> 38:16.374
in the near place of
where they were killed.

38:17.683 --> 38:21.952
The fact that RVs always
appear in the rain is related

38:21.977 --> 38:25.624
to the fact that 80% of
the human body is H2O.

38:26.518 --> 38:29.903
And the iron content in
her blood is more than

38:29.928 --> 38:33.167
ten times higher than
that of normal humans.

38:34.268 --> 38:37.507
When the vengeance is
enacted, all these seem to be

38:37.532 --> 38:40.832
related to the strong magnetic
field that is formed.

38:45.225 --> 38:48.858
However, this is the first
case that RV has come

38:48.883 --> 38:52.292
back in a living state
after failing revenge.

38:54.225 --> 38:57.268
We visited here to find out the reason.

39:04.183 --> 39:05.475
Who are you?

39:09.058 --> 39:14.268
Choi Myung-sook.

39:15.268 --> 39:17.268
Aren't you already dead?

39:24.058 --> 39:26.018
Then why'd you come back?

39:30.225 --> 39:31.975
For vengeance…

39:34.183 --> 39:39.893
against my killer.

39:42.475 --> 39:44.268
Did your son kill you?

39:51.850 --> 39:54.433
Then why did you attack him?

39:57.600 --> 40:02.643
Because my son…

40:05.100 --> 40:07.975
made me die.

40:10.683 --> 40:12.433
Who sent you?

40:18.068 --> 40:21.610
Who ordered you to seek revenge?

40:25.350 --> 40:31.725
Choi Myung-sook.

40:44.700 --> 40:49.450
They must've gotten his DNA
from your mother's hand.

40:49.475 --> 40:52.018
Then why say someone else was the killer?

40:52.058 --> 40:53.268
It makes no sense.

40:55.069 --> 41:00.984
We'll know for sure by comparing
his DNA to what was on my mom.

41:02.975 --> 41:05.933
The guy that we caught is a perfect match.

41:06.643 --> 41:09.350
- So he's the real killer?
- Yes.

41:09.819 --> 41:12.734
They framed the wrong guy 7 years ago.

41:13.975 --> 41:14.975
Really?

41:22.997 --> 41:25.957
Choi Myung-sook's case is different.

41:25.982 --> 41:28.982
There's no telling what could happen.

41:29.350 --> 41:32.100
We can't keep saying it's the first case.

41:33.351 --> 41:35.518
What's with you?

41:36.683 --> 41:39.808
You said to cover it up
again, so I'll do my best.

41:40.643 --> 41:44.100
But it's like hiding my head in the sand.

41:45.359 --> 41:48.776
What's done is done. It's complicated.

41:49.498 --> 41:51.583
This time, the revenge
target is a prosecutor.

41:52.131 --> 41:55.631
And the police are on the hunt.

41:56.425 --> 42:01.675
But we're doing this for
the country and people.

42:08.218 --> 42:09.968
Just do as you're told.

42:10.956 --> 42:12.499
Don't complain.

42:16.218 --> 42:17.593
Rude bastard.

42:37.008 --> 42:40.550
He says he's only guilty
of illegal residency.

42:40.593 --> 42:41.593
Chief?

42:42.343 --> 42:45.468
He's been charged with 2 murders in China.

42:50.008 --> 42:55.383
If you're sent back to China,
you'll be shot within months.

42:56.068 --> 42:58.400
But the death sentence here

42:58.425 --> 43:04.218
hasn't been carried out in over 20 years.

43:14.883 --> 43:16.968
This man chased you earlier.

43:19.508 --> 43:21.175
You know him, don't you?

43:26.093 --> 43:27.343
He asks if he's a cop.

43:29.508 --> 43:31.175
Choi had another insurance.

43:31.218 --> 43:32.218
What?

43:32.758 --> 43:34.175
You can't go in, sir!

43:40.073 --> 43:42.400
A man and his daughter
died on the same day.

43:42.425 --> 43:44.800
The man's father received
Choi's other insurance payout.

43:45.425 --> 43:49.718
Myung Hyun-chul was 38
and Eun-ji was 9 when they died.

43:50.236 --> 43:51.026
Cause of death?

43:51.051 --> 43:54.676
Both died in traffic
accidents in Hongeun-dong.

43:57.258 --> 43:59.718
Isn't that where Seo lives?

44:00.972 --> 44:01.972
Yes.

44:16.308 --> 44:23.643
I'm a prosecutor who has been
investigating this case for a long time.

44:24.802 --> 44:28.135
I'm also the son of the woman
you killed 7 years ago.

44:29.564 --> 44:32.896
I know that the investigation
was fabricated.

44:33.253 --> 44:39.300
And I know that you didn't do it alone.

44:58.525 --> 45:01.482
As I snatched her bag and looked back…

45:01.855 --> 45:07.980
some weird guy appeared
and stabbed the woman madly.

45:12.206 --> 45:13.581
Who was he?

45:15.342 --> 45:16.800
- Stop!
- Move!

45:16.825 --> 45:18.283
Who are you?

45:22.252 --> 45:23.544
National intelligence.

45:24.651 --> 45:25.901
We're taking Li.

45:26.472 --> 45:29.264
Choi Myung-sook's case
is under our jurisdiction.

45:29.291 --> 45:32.666
The prosecution and police
have handed the case to us.

45:33.618 --> 45:35.158
You can check if you'd like.

45:49.458 --> 45:52.958
We're sending Li back to China.

45:53.250 --> 45:59.293
They've agreed to charge him
upon his arrival tomorrow.

45:59.499 --> 46:01.916
But we have to find the second culprit.

46:05.418 --> 46:10.083
And find the one who fabricated
the DNA results 7 years ago.

46:10.583 --> 46:12.708
You've already checked with forensics.

46:18.293 --> 46:19.293
Come in.

46:20.293 --> 46:21.543
INSURANCE PAYMENT RECORD

46:21.583 --> 46:22.918
Myung Jin-soo.

46:23.793 --> 46:25.125
Who is he?

46:28.500 --> 46:29.500
But why…

46:30.000 --> 46:32.750
Does Choi's family know?

46:35.500 --> 46:38.875
I've sworn to secrecy
with the policy holder.

46:41.125 --> 46:42.583
But she passed away.

46:47.293 --> 46:51.458
I don't know him. I just made the payout.

46:54.333 --> 46:57.918
She said that Jin-Hong could never know.

46:59.250 --> 47:00.875
So I never told him.

47:01.793 --> 47:03.418
Why? Is something wrong?

47:04.333 --> 47:06.000
Really? Hold on.

47:06.708 --> 47:07.918
He's not in the country.

47:08.583 --> 47:12.958
The researcher who submitted
the false DNA flew off to the U.S.

47:13.190 --> 47:14.815
He lives there now.

47:15.793 --> 47:17.293
I'll call you later.

47:18.500 --> 47:25.875
Someone fabricated the evidence
of Choi's killer and closed the case.

47:28.168 --> 47:29.000
9 years ago

47:29.043 --> 47:34.208
Myung and his daughter died
in unexplained traffic accidents.

47:37.208 --> 47:42.708
But Choi secretly made
Myung's father her beneficiary.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.043
Why?

48:00.250 --> 48:03.875
I definitely saw his body light up!

48:06.418 --> 48:11.918
I was totally shocked and terrified.

48:16.764 --> 48:22.679
The Macau women burst into flames,
then vanished too.

48:54.333 --> 48:55.500
Who's this?

49:14.918 --> 49:17.418
What the hell!

49:23.227 --> 49:28.435
Ra… Ne… Ka… Ma.

50:47.793 --> 50:48.793
Yes?

50:49.502 --> 50:50.502
Where are you?

50:50.543 --> 50:51.668
Same place as before.

50:52.125 --> 50:54.458
Do it and wrap up the case.

50:55.958 --> 50:57.668
Yes, sir.

51:01.250 --> 51:02.083
7 YEARS AGO

51:02.125 --> 51:03.583
Why here of all places?

51:05.418 --> 51:06.793
Why here, you ask?

51:07.625 --> 51:10.750
Over 500 bodies are found here every year.

51:13.070 --> 51:14.360
So many commit suicide.

51:14.385 --> 51:17.678
There's no telling how
many end up as fish food.

51:41.440 --> 51:46.730
If his body turns up,
they'll think it was a suicide.

51:47.608 --> 51:54.568
Or they won't want to identify
such a badly bloated corpse.

51:54.608 --> 51:58.858
With forensics on our side,
this is the best way.

51:59.275 --> 52:02.650
Might as well make use
of having the world's highest suicide rate.

52:15.775 --> 52:19.525
Why did you fabricate the DNA 7 years ago?

52:23.483 --> 52:25.400
Things are complicated.

52:26.068 --> 52:27.775
At least you cleared your name.

52:28.150 --> 52:31.233
Your mother died, and
you got the insurance.

52:31.733 --> 52:33.650
What else do you need?

52:33.693 --> 52:35.193
That makes no sense.

52:35.650 --> 52:38.108
None of this makes sense.

52:41.068 --> 52:44.358
Late at night after Seo passed the bar,

52:44.900 --> 52:48.443
9-year-old Myung Eun-ji
died in a hit-and-run.

52:48.483 --> 52:53.900
Her father was also found dead
on the street 4 kilometers away.

52:55.608 --> 52:57.358
I don't know them!

52:57.400 --> 53:00.650
And your mother secretly

53:00.693 --> 53:04.608
gave money to the man's father,
as well as her insurance payout.

53:08.108 --> 53:09.108
What?

53:09.891 --> 53:14.851
9 years ago, on the night
Seo Jin-Hong passed the bar…

53:16.358 --> 53:18.025
Tell me what happened.

53:29.193 --> 53:33.025
If you lie, you could be legally charged.

53:45.943 --> 53:49.943
We checked the CCTV footage at the scene.

53:49.983 --> 53:52.108
And all the eyewitness accounts.

53:52.851 --> 53:56.726
This man actually died 2 years earlier.

53:59.849 --> 54:03.056
The second culprit was Myung Hyun-chul.

54:04.400 --> 54:08.358
He appeared as an RV 2
years after his death.

54:09.108 --> 54:11.400
He got his revenge on Choi.

54:13.400 --> 54:16.068
Then he vanished in the rain.

54:24.108 --> 54:25.193
You mean…

54:26.862 --> 54:29.155
he died because of my mom?

54:29.943 --> 54:31.983
December 2nd, 2006.

54:32.358 --> 54:36.858
He died in an accident
in your neighborhood.

54:39.525 --> 54:44.358
His daughter was also found dead nearby.

54:49.900 --> 54:54.108
Your mom must've moved
one of them after the accident.

54:55.483 --> 55:02.733
Or perhaps one struggled to get help,
and then later died.

55:04.233 --> 55:09.483
Leave it to us to chase
such mirage-like phenomena.

55:15.816 --> 55:22.899
Choi got her revenge, so
she'll soon vanish, too.

55:32.108 --> 55:33.568
Seo Jin-Hong speaking.

55:34.275 --> 55:36.943
I found the person who
called you last night.

55:37.400 --> 55:40.858
His name is Park Yo-Han. He's an ex-cop.

55:42.295 --> 55:44.795
He worked at the station in Hongeun-dong.

55:44.820 --> 55:49.112
In 2006 he suddenly quit.

55:53.233 --> 55:57.525
The first officer to the scene
quit his job 9 years ago.

55:57.735 --> 56:00.650
He's become extremely on
edge, as if on the run.

56:00.675 --> 56:03.218
They say he's been living
in his shop lately.

56:26.108 --> 56:28.608
I'M SORRY

56:38.775 --> 56:40.318
SEO JIN-HONG

56:41.193 --> 56:42.358
Chief!

56:55.127 --> 56:56.792
He hasn't been dead for long.

57:16.175 --> 57:20.883
After seeing the CCTV footage
at the scene of your mom's accident,

57:20.925 --> 57:25.718
I suspected you were involved in her death.

57:26.133 --> 57:29.008
You could've crossed the street
before the light changed.

57:29.050 --> 57:34.508
But you walked slowly,
as if to wait for the accident.

57:37.383 --> 57:38.633
This was here for you.

57:49.425 --> 57:50.425
That night,

57:51.258 --> 57:58.843
a report came in past 1:00 a.m.
and I headed out.

58:03.883 --> 58:05.050
Mister!

58:07.593 --> 58:09.383
Are you okay, kid?

58:10.133 --> 58:11.343
Where's your dad?

58:11.925 --> 58:13.050
In his room.

58:32.258 --> 58:33.383
Mister!

58:36.843 --> 58:38.468
Wake up, sir!

58:38.800 --> 58:39.968
Get lost!

58:42.675 --> 58:45.508
Go bring my damn wife!

58:55.425 --> 58:56.593
Bastard.

58:59.383 --> 59:02.758
He's your father, right?

59:04.468 --> 59:10.718
If I take you now, your
dad might report me.

59:11.093 --> 59:14.050
He'll be okay when he's not drunk.

59:17.008 --> 59:18.925
Please don't go!

59:18.968 --> 59:20.718
It's okay. Don't worry!

59:20.758 --> 59:22.550
Please help us!

59:22.593 --> 59:24.883
It's okay. Don't cry.

59:24.925 --> 59:26.300
Take care!

59:31.133 --> 59:33.343
I returned to the station.

59:34.550 --> 59:37.593
An hour later, Choi Myung-sook came by.

59:38.468 --> 59:39.675
Is something wrong?

59:46.843 --> 59:49.925
He has a bright future ahead of him!

59:50.425 --> 59:53.843
All he knows is studying!
He made a mistake!

59:54.258 --> 59:55.550
Please let him off this once!

59:55.593 --> 59:57.336
No! Wait!

01:00:01.485 --> 01:00:04.817
Say that I stole the truck!

01:00:06.008 --> 01:00:07.008
Please!

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.318
I beg you!

01:00:09.343 --> 01:00:10.343
Please!

01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:12.050
I beg you!

01:00:13.093 --> 01:00:14.093
Please!

01:00:15.425 --> 01:00:16.593
Please, sir!

01:00:17.468 --> 01:00:21.968
So I returned the truck to its owner.

01:00:23.139 --> 01:00:28.307
I thought everything was over then.

01:00:39.862 --> 01:00:41.779
Officer! Over here!

01:00:45.164 --> 01:00:46.746
I was scared.

01:00:48.093 --> 01:00:49.883
If I went to prison,

01:00:51.425 --> 01:00:54.008
what would happen to my wife and kid?

01:00:55.675 --> 01:01:01.300
It wasn't for me, but for my family.

01:01:03.343 --> 01:01:07.758
If I just kept quiet,
no one would ever know.

01:01:09.758 --> 01:01:11.758
That's what I thought.

01:01:21.881 --> 01:01:30.256
But lately, I started seeing the dead girl.

01:01:32.198 --> 01:01:39.740
She kept chasing me around,
as if she wanted me to die.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:47.035
Prosecutor Seo Jin-Hong,
I hope you turn yourself in.

01:01:48.325 --> 01:01:52.992
We were all punished because of you.

01:01:53.557 --> 01:01:58.267
I can't get an arrest warrant
for a prosecutor with this will.

01:01:59.267 --> 01:02:04.432
But I may if I let this leak in the media.

01:02:06.593 --> 01:02:11.258
But without hard evidence
or a confession from you,

01:02:12.139 --> 01:02:15.432
it'll be hard to indict you.

01:02:16.218 --> 01:02:19.968
I don't remember anything.

01:02:21.968 --> 01:02:25.343
If you can't find other evidence of this,

01:02:26.596 --> 01:02:30.803
I'll find it myself.

01:02:52.096 --> 01:02:53.346
Jin-Hong? Where are you?

01:02:53.458 --> 01:02:54.458
Hee-Jung…

01:02:54.561 --> 01:02:58.061
When I came home drunk
late at night after passing the bar,

01:02:58.549 --> 01:03:00.424
what happened to Mom?

01:03:00.468 --> 01:03:01.468
Jin-Hong.

01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:03.365
The cops were here.

01:03:03.633 --> 01:03:05.468
They asked the same thing!

01:03:05.938 --> 01:03:09.145
They think you and Mom
killed someone back then.

01:03:10.065 --> 01:03:12.482
I said I didn't know anything.

01:03:12.883 --> 01:03:13.883
What?

01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:17.400
You got really drunk and ran off!

01:03:17.781 --> 01:03:20.906
You said you didn't remember
how your mom brought you home.

01:03:21.739 --> 01:03:23.603
Is something wrong?

01:03:40.262 --> 01:03:43.512
Man! I knew you'd pass the bar!

01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:47.756
If I ever do something wrong,

01:03:48.835 --> 01:03:50.710
you're letting me off! Got it?

01:03:50.768 --> 01:03:51.768
Fool!

01:03:51.893 --> 01:03:55.683
I'll put your dad on the witness stand.

01:03:56.475 --> 01:03:58.850
So he'll beat you in court!

01:04:01.725 --> 01:04:04.100
No problem! I don't care!

01:05:06.544 --> 01:05:08.178
Mom?

01:05:11.225 --> 01:05:13.433
- Cabbages on sale!
- Mom?

01:05:13.475 --> 01:05:15.350
- Big sale!
- Are you deaf?

01:05:15.393 --> 01:05:17.808
I told you not to sell here!

01:05:17.933 --> 01:05:18.933
What?

01:05:19.033 --> 01:05:20.908
You can't boss me around!

01:05:20.933 --> 01:05:21.933
Damn it!

01:05:21.958 --> 01:05:23.619
Please don't.

01:05:23.643 --> 01:05:25.308
You bastard!

01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:28.268
You crazy woman!

01:05:28.558 --> 01:05:30.683
Calm down! Back off!

01:05:30.725 --> 01:05:32.058
I'm dying here!

01:05:34.893 --> 01:05:36.808
I'm dying here!

01:05:37.143 --> 01:05:40.933
- Push me again, you fool!
- Stop acting!

01:05:41.933 --> 01:05:43.018
That's too much.

01:05:43.058 --> 01:05:45.100
That's enough, ma'am.

01:05:47.058 --> 01:05:49.850
Why don't you go home!

01:06:17.433 --> 01:06:18.893
TO HONGEUN-DONG

01:06:48.433 --> 01:06:49.433
Go on.

01:07:23.974 --> 01:07:25.726
Why isn't she vanishing?

01:07:39.808 --> 01:07:40.808
Chief?

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:45.868
Park Yo-Han was the first one
at the scene of Eun-ji's accident.

01:07:45.893 --> 01:07:48.350
The suspect was identified
after several years.

01:07:48.393 --> 01:07:51.768
He was found dead today at his workplace.

01:07:52.053 --> 01:07:53.053
Chief?

01:07:56.016 --> 01:08:02.141
How many cases have been closed
without having caught the killer?

01:08:04.095 --> 01:08:06.638
Probably dozens a year.

01:08:07.423 --> 01:08:08.423
Why?

01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:14.703
Choi Myung-sook may not
be the first RV in Korea.

01:08:33.893 --> 01:08:35.433
Stop the bus!

01:08:35.808 --> 01:08:37.430
Mister!

01:08:42.058 --> 01:08:43.268
Mister!

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:48.435
Please stop the bus!

01:09:02.712 --> 01:09:04.448
What's he doing?

01:09:04.591 --> 01:09:07.578
Mister! Stop the bus!

01:09:07.904 --> 01:09:10.194
The breaks won't work! Get back!

01:09:12.518 --> 01:09:13.518
Stop the bus!

01:10:35.833 --> 01:10:36.833
Mom…

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.600
Mom…

01:10:43.165 --> 01:10:45.080
Sorry, I ignored you then!

01:10:47.292 --> 01:10:49.116
I'm sorry, Mom!

01:10:50.034 --> 01:10:52.117
I'll do everything for you!

01:10:57.279 --> 01:10:59.279
You can rest now, Mom.

01:11:03.645 --> 01:11:04.645
Vroom!

01:11:53.649 --> 01:11:55.314
Must be Mom's.

01:12:11.975 --> 01:12:13.310
Geez!

01:12:14.893 --> 01:12:16.018
What was that?

01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:22.475
What in the world?

01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:26.166
Jin-Hong drove this here?

01:12:29.276 --> 01:12:30.276
Oh no!

01:12:30.825 --> 01:12:31.825
Oh my god!

01:12:32.283 --> 01:12:33.658
Is he out of his mind!

01:12:34.262 --> 01:12:35.347
What did he do!

01:12:37.738 --> 01:12:41.528
If you say anything, you're dead!

01:12:51.078 --> 01:12:52.078
Mom!

01:12:55.089 --> 01:12:56.131
Mom!

01:12:57.993 --> 01:12:59.700
Where are you going?

01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:02.450
Damn it!

01:13:29.908 --> 01:13:30.993
Eun-ji!

01:13:32.783 --> 01:13:33.825
Eun-ji!

01:13:35.408 --> 01:13:36.614
Kid!

01:13:36.730 --> 01:13:37.730
Eun-ji!

01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:44.970
Kid!

01:13:45.118 --> 01:13:46.118
Wake up!

01:13:47.205 --> 01:13:48.650
Eun-ji!

01:13:48.933 --> 01:13:49.933
My baby!

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.743
Who did this?

01:13:52.278 --> 01:13:53.278
Eun-ji!

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:55.200
Open your eyes.

01:13:55.377 --> 01:13:56.459
Daddy's here!

01:13:58.533 --> 01:13:59.825
Eun-ji! No!

01:14:01.686 --> 01:14:04.019
Why! No!

01:14:23.688 --> 01:14:25.348
That bitch!

01:14:32.908 --> 01:14:33.908
Stop!

01:14:35.408 --> 01:14:36.533
Pull over!

01:14:38.408 --> 01:14:39.408
Stop!

01:14:47.033 --> 01:14:48.033
Damn it!

01:14:53.425 --> 01:14:55.189
Stop the truck!

01:15:35.949 --> 01:15:40.409
Do you remember what happened last night?

01:15:46.885 --> 01:15:49.092
Why? What happened?

01:15:50.444 --> 01:15:55.069
You were drunk and lost in the street.

01:15:57.408 --> 01:15:59.118
I brought you home.

01:15:59.993 --> 01:16:01.075
Really?

01:16:05.364 --> 01:16:06.964
Sorry, Mom.

01:16:08.398 --> 01:16:10.941
Luckily, nothing happened.

01:16:12.408 --> 01:16:14.743
Come out when you're hungry.

01:17:34.533 --> 01:17:36.118
Don't you remember me?

01:17:39.717 --> 01:17:41.884
Why did you ignore me?

01:17:55.655 --> 01:17:57.862
Come to heaven with me.

01:17:58.318 --> 01:18:00.733
No!

01:18:12.632 --> 01:18:13.632
Mom…

01:18:28.961 --> 01:18:30.999
My son didn't do it!

01:18:31.914 --> 01:18:35.204
It was all my fault!

01:18:41.738 --> 01:18:42.778
Please…

01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:45.350
Please! Let him live!

01:18:46.536 --> 01:18:49.161
He didn't know. It's my fault!

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.283
I'll die again!

01:18:57.038 --> 01:18:58.434
I'll die a thousand times!

01:18:58.459 --> 01:18:59.459
Stop it!

01:19:02.644 --> 01:19:05.059
Please! I'll die a thousand times!

01:19:05.755 --> 01:19:06.755
Stop!

01:19:07.139 --> 01:19:09.639
Please! I'll die a thousand times!

01:19:10.036 --> 01:19:11.036
Stop it!

01:19:20.475 --> 01:19:21.600
That night…

01:19:22.055 --> 01:19:23.805
I was the one who hit you.

01:19:25.408 --> 01:19:26.908
I remember now.

01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:33.698
It's all my fault.

01:19:34.539 --> 01:19:36.156
Eun-ji!

01:19:36.165 --> 01:19:37.623
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:19:39.075 --> 01:19:40.118
Mom…

01:19:45.435 --> 01:19:49.767
You've suffered enough for me.

01:19:53.118 --> 01:19:54.118
Stop.

01:19:55.616 --> 01:19:57.426
I'm sorry.

01:20:23.783 --> 01:20:25.326
I'll set things right.

01:20:26.657 --> 01:20:30.407
I'll pay for my crime.

01:21:12.656 --> 01:21:16.366
Please forgive him!

01:22:17.563 --> 01:22:20.324
Mom! I passed the bar!

01:23:35.092 --> 01:23:40.132
Charged with killing a girl
while drunk driving 9 years ago,

01:23:40.175 --> 01:23:45.468
Seo Jin-Hong turned himself in before
the statute of limitations expired.

01:23:46.343 --> 01:23:51.968
Even before his trial,
Seo claimed he would not appeal.

01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:14.762
Defendant Seo Jin-Hong.

01:24:14.843 --> 01:24:18.968
Do you have any last words
before the verdict?

01:24:30.175 --> 01:24:33.383
According to the police,

01:24:35.425 --> 01:24:37.675
Eun-ji died because of me.

01:24:38.968 --> 01:24:40.133
That is true.

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:43.508
It's late, but I'd like to offer her
my sincerest apology.

01:24:44.508 --> 01:24:49.093
And I'd like to apologize to my mother too.

01:24:52.411 --> 01:24:53.536
To be honest…

01:24:56.883 --> 01:25:00.718
I saw my mom that day.

01:25:04.343 --> 01:25:08.093
She was standing across the
street waiting for me.

01:25:10.504 --> 01:25:14.922
I knew if I didn't run,
I wouldn't cross the street in time.

01:25:18.425 --> 01:25:20.508
But I just walked slowly.

01:25:24.258 --> 01:25:25.758
Why did I do that?

01:25:34.134 --> 01:25:35.851
I couldn't be bothered.

01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:43.675
All her life…

01:25:46.133 --> 01:25:52.508
she wanted me to have a bright future.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.883
But I didn't run across…

01:26:02.017 --> 01:26:03.892
because I couldn't be bothered.

01:26:07.925 --> 01:26:09.008
Until now,

01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:12.468
we've considered RV as 'judge' of revenge.

01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:18.075
But, in this case there was an error
in the basic role of RVs.

01:26:18.675 --> 01:26:21.593
What is your answer for this case?

01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:23.550
It wasn't an error.

01:26:24.173 --> 01:26:27.380
Rather, I see it as the perfect judgment.

01:26:27.968 --> 01:26:32.633
Seo realized his sin and
asked to pay the price.

01:26:34.966 --> 01:26:40.634
It's the first case that showed
forgiveness is possible over revenge.

01:26:40.879 --> 01:26:43.962
I hope it's remembered as that.
