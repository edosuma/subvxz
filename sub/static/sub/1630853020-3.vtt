00:13.840 --> 00:18.720
<i>Rognvaldr has betrayed his brother</i>
<i>and helped Brida to invade Eoferwic.</i>

00:19.240 --> 00:21.800
Do not be afraid, brother,
she's here to save us.

00:21.880 --> 00:26.160
<i>Whilst Brida has set Sigtryggr</i>
<i>a task he dare not refuse.</i>

00:26.240 --> 00:28.680
We will find your wife, you know we will.

00:28.760 --> 00:32.800
I will spare her life
if you bring me Uhtred.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.680
<i>Eadith has delivered</i>
<i>the gravest news.</i>

00:35.760 --> 00:38.960
Lady, I fear it is too late
to save you from this canker.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.600
I believe you will not see the spring.

00:41.680 --> 00:44.880
<i>In Winchester,</i>
<i>King Edward has found a new love.</i>

00:45.440 --> 00:47.680
Lady Eadgifu, eat with us.

00:48.280 --> 00:51.800
Lord King, I would be honored.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.000
<i>But Aethelhelm continues</i>
<i>to plot against him.</i>

00:54.080 --> 00:58.480
Inform the Saxon boroughs
not to give troops to assist him.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.600
This is the word of the king, is it?

01:00.680 --> 01:02.320
If asked, he will deny it.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.920
<i>Stiorra cannot stand by</i>
<i>and let her people be murdered.</i>

01:07.000 --> 01:09.840
Brida! You will pay for this!

01:09.920 --> 01:11.400
Then show yourself!

01:11.480 --> 01:14.880
<i>We must now enter the city</i>
<i>by stealth and save my daughter.</i>

01:16.400 --> 01:17.760
<i>Destiny is all!</i>

01:30.440 --> 01:31.520
Brida!

01:44.560 --> 01:45.680
Stiorra!

01:46.240 --> 01:49.280
Stiorra, do not do this!
Do not cross her!

01:55.880 --> 01:59.840
- See how the gods favor us, my Beloveds?

01:59.920 --> 02:01.480
See who they bring us?

02:01.560 --> 02:04.160
The gods will not forget
what you've done in their name.

02:04.240 --> 02:06.440
Hold your tongue,
or my men will cut it out for you.

02:06.520 --> 02:09.120
No. You will fight me.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.680
You have taken my city
and murdered my people.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.479
<i>You</i> will face me.

02:16.039 --> 02:18.520
Or will you hide behind your slaves?

02:19.920 --> 02:24.560
You have Uhtred's eyes. Perhaps I shall
keep them when I'm finished with you.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.360
- What's this?

02:28.440 --> 02:31.280
She was helping
some others escape. She went for me.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.600
There is no cause
for more bloodshed, Brida.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.240
Hella is a good servant,
she can be useful to you.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.000
Mm.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.120
What do you say, girl, hm?

02:48.080 --> 02:49.600
Will you make yourself useful?

02:55.080 --> 02:55.920
Good.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.680
Let her death be a warning to all of you

03:15.760 --> 03:18.480
who would stand
beside the Dane slayer's daughter.

03:35.560 --> 03:36.600
Keep moving!

03:42.920 --> 03:44.040
Make the square.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.400
Fight me, Brida.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.480
You're no warrior.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.480
I am the Queen of Eoferwic.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.120
I am my father's daughter.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.560
Perhaps you're afraid
the gods will favor me?

03:57.640 --> 03:59.440
You know nothing of the gods.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.440
Make the square.

04:08.480 --> 04:12.040
- Do not do this, Stiorra! Do not fight!

05:15.400 --> 05:16.400
We're in the city.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.480
Make a square!

05:50.200 --> 05:52.280
Well, now I know what a turd feels like.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.640
Stiorra.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.200
Stiorra, don't do this!

06:57.600 --> 06:59.720
You know what to do,
move quickly.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.920
Don't fight, Stiorra!

07:05.520 --> 07:07.160
We go on your signal.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.320
Shh.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.720
I'll get you out, be ready.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.880
Come on, you bastards, you!

08:15.960 --> 08:16.920
Ha-ha!

09:03.360 --> 09:04.680
Brida!

09:07.640 --> 09:11.640
Ah! You should not have come
for my children, Brida.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.480
It's not like the little priest
was using his cock.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.400
Sigtryggr!

09:35.720 --> 09:38.240
- Stiorra!

09:42.840 --> 09:45.320
Hold back some men
to help the townsfolk.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.040
Be ready!

10:27.720 --> 10:29.880
Vibeke, hide until I come for you.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.120
To the woods! Hide yourselves!

11:05.440 --> 11:06.440
Take cover!

11:29.760 --> 11:30.760
Vibeke!

11:33.120 --> 11:35.400
Vibeke! Vibeke, hold on!

11:35.480 --> 11:37.040
Mother! Mother!

11:43.680 --> 11:45.640
Vibeke, the gods will protect you!

11:51.080 --> 11:54.000
- Child, get back from the edge.
- Mother!

11:54.080 --> 11:54.920
Vibeke!

11:55.640 --> 11:56.920
Come to me.

11:57.480 --> 11:58.520
Don't go to him.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.200
Do not be afraid.
Give me your hand.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.200
Jump to me!

12:02.840 --> 12:05.720
- Vibeke. Jump to me. The gods are with us.
- Brida, no!

12:06.680 --> 12:09.600
- Give me your hand.
- Trust me, we can do this.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.440
You can do this, trust me.

12:11.520 --> 12:12.720
I will catch you!

12:14.320 --> 12:15.920
- No!
- Vibeke!

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Vibeke!

13:27.400 --> 13:30.560
Retreat! Retreat!

13:48.320 --> 13:49.160
Take him.

13:51.120 --> 13:54.120
I'm Sigtryggr's brother.
I'm Sigtryggr's brother!

13:54.880 --> 13:56.400
Sigtryggr, she made me.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.160
She made me!

15:01.880 --> 15:04.760
I knew you would come.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.920
You fought well, Stiorra.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.520
Brida escaped.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.520
Why did you let her live?

15:13.960 --> 15:20.320
Her child lay dead. There'd have been
no honor in taking advantage of her grief.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.600
She'll find more to follow her.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.240
Now is the time to end this.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.520
- We lost so many of our people.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.280
- If you don't go after her, I will.
- I will. I will.

15:33.440 --> 15:34.280
Finan.

15:34.360 --> 15:40.040
Sihtric. Fetch our men from Rumcofa.
The victory feasting will have to wait.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.560
Whatâ€¦ What is it, Lord?

15:42.120 --> 15:43.400
We must ride after Brida.

15:44.640 --> 15:45.760
Now.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.440
Uh, Lord, I must speak with you--

15:49.520 --> 15:51.800
Fetch Father Pyrlig.
He will be with the townspeople.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.880
Then stay here and make sure
the rest of the city is secured.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.400
- Brother, I have wronged you.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.640
I was deceived by the witch.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.400
- You will be silent.

16:22.520 --> 16:23.600
Wait! Please!

16:26.040 --> 16:27.320
I fought with you!

16:27.400 --> 16:31.240
No, you saw the tide turn
and sought only to save yourself.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.040
I saved your life.

16:39.680 --> 16:40.600
We're brothers.

16:43.720 --> 16:44.840
We're blood.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.240
To the woods!
Hide there until it's safe to come back.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.760
These men will take you to the others,
do not be afraid.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.160
You might as well have a bell
around your neck, boy.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.400
I'm sorry.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.080
Look, bodies.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.520
She came this way.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.160
Maybe we should fetch the others.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.360
I'm sorry.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.200
Your first battle, it is common.

18:21.040 --> 18:24.400
I emptied my guts into my brother
Ragnar's helmet after my first.

18:27.680 --> 18:32.040
You did well. Fetch the others,
tell them Brida is traveling north.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.040
- I'll go ahead.
- Uhtred, no.

18:34.120 --> 18:37.240
Brida escaped,
it was not your doing, you know that.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.480
You must stop blaming yourself.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.440
She did not escape.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.240
I let her go.

19:06.280 --> 19:07.440
Can this be true?

19:07.920 --> 19:11.400
The priest was quite certain
Lady Aethelflaed will not see the spring.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.640
The king has received no word
from his sister.

19:19.440 --> 19:24.160
It seems she will not seek
the support of Wessex

19:24.680 --> 19:26.400
before she names her successor.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.800
She only needs
the Mercian Witan's approval.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.560
They will all seek the throne
for their own sons.

19:32.120 --> 19:35.200
Whoever she names
will have a bloody battle on his hands.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.120
Mm.

19:40.080 --> 19:43.280
Unless she intends the throne
for the Lady Aelfwynn.

19:43.360 --> 19:44.480
Her daughter?

19:45.040 --> 19:48.280
What, you really think the Witan would
put aside their own ambitions so easily?

19:48.360 --> 19:52.160
They won't like it,
but there is an argument to be made

19:52.800 --> 19:54.880
for peaceful continuity.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.880
It avoids the infighting,
which we saw at Aethelred's passing.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.800
But perhaps that is not the only solution.

20:03.360 --> 20:10.240
- You have someone in mind?
- Who better than my grandson Aelfweard?

20:11.160 --> 20:12.640
He is nephew to the lady.

20:12.720 --> 20:17.360
He is a far more suitable choice
to continue her line

20:17.440 --> 20:21.720
and he is young enough that the ealdormen
will believe they can influence him.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.160
They will need persuading.

20:23.240 --> 20:25.400
Indeed.

20:27.680 --> 20:30.280
We must proceed with caution.

20:31.400 --> 20:35.280
Find out how loyal
the Witan are to Aethelflaed.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.120
I can send word to our friends
in Aegelesburg.

20:37.200 --> 20:40.480
Yes. Do it quickly.
This will not stay secret long.

20:40.560 --> 20:43.480
Mm. Not if that arseling priest
has anything to do with it.

20:48.560 --> 20:49.400
Lord!

20:50.880 --> 20:53.400
If Brida passed this way,
it was hours ago.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.680
We could always return at daybreak, Lord.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.840
With more men from Eoferwic,
we could spread the search wider.

20:58.920 --> 21:01.280
It will be too late. We must keep looking.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.160
The trail is cold, Uhtred.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.240
We return to Eoferwic!

21:22.640 --> 21:23.760
You will find her.

21:24.680 --> 21:25.680
Yes, I will.

21:30.560 --> 21:31.400
Lord King.

21:32.960 --> 21:36.520
I've had word from Mercia
that my men never reached Sigtryggr.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.680
Aethelflaed sent no help to Eoferwic.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.800
- I see.
- I do not understand it.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.720
Why would my sister endanger
the peace so recklessly?

21:46.880 --> 21:51.120
Perhaps the Lady Aethelflaed has done
what Wessex should have done long ago

21:51.200 --> 21:53.360
and cut ties with the enemy within.

21:54.240 --> 21:55.640
No, this is not like her.

21:56.360 --> 21:59.880
And why has there been no word
from Pyrlig?

22:02.040 --> 22:05.240
I will send a messenger to Aegelesburg.
We are missing something.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.880
Come on, you need to drink
to your first victory.

22:17.960 --> 22:21.160
This is the part where we usually enjoy
the gratitude of the local women.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.320
If Brida left any.

22:51.640 --> 22:52.920
I was blind.

22:53.880 --> 22:57.040
I opened the gates
and I let the wolves among my people.

22:57.120 --> 23:01.880
You led us to victory.
Eoferwic is restored, Stiorra's safe.

23:02.800 --> 23:06.040
They have all betrayed me.
Not just the one I called brother.

23:06.120 --> 23:10.440
I've been weak. I kept silent
as the Christians poisoned my people.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.720
I share your anger.

23:16.840 --> 23:19.880
- But the truce is held--
- The truce? There was no truce.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.520
It was all lies and trickery.

23:23.720 --> 23:27.320
The Christians' words are as false
as the God they pretend to love.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.040
And I was a fool to trust them.

23:29.680 --> 23:30.800
I think you're wrong.

23:30.880 --> 23:35.040
Why? Why do you defend them?
If Brida had threatened Christian Mercia,

23:35.120 --> 23:37.520
do you think Edward would have looked
the other way?

23:39.200 --> 23:43.080
But when Danes are under attack,
he turns against us.

23:43.960 --> 23:48.120
Uhtred, we are heathens to be sacrificed,
nothing more.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.680
Pyrlig said Edward did send men to Mercia
intended for your aid.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.920
You have won how many battles for them?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.360
This is how they repay you?

23:56.040 --> 23:59.280
They dishonor you.
They abandon your daughter?

23:59.920 --> 24:01.480
They do not have your oath.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.200
They forfeit your allegiance.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.800
Swear your loyalty to me.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.080
Stand beside your kin.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.040
Hm?

24:26.600 --> 24:28.000
My place is in Rumcofa.

24:35.120 --> 24:35.960
Mm.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.640
Father, Sigtryggr isâ€¦

25:16.080 --> 25:19.560
His brother's betrayal,
there's a shadow on him now.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.800
His pride is wounded,
he needs time to heal.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.960
It's not just his pride,
I know you see it too.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.440
He needs your guidance,
he'll listen to you.

25:34.560 --> 25:35.400
Will you stay?

25:53.520 --> 25:56.040
Drink this.
It'll help you sleep, Lady.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.040
You have a slight fever.

25:58.560 --> 26:01.480
I shouldn't sleep
until Father Benedict has visited.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.920
My mother was never going to let me
travel home without a priest.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.400
Benedict is here, my dearest.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.120
The lady should rest tonight.
She is weakened from the journey.

26:12.920 --> 26:16.960
She will be healed by God's grace,
not your potions.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.680
Will you help me
with my robe, Eadith?

26:34.600 --> 26:37.960
The sacrament of healing will restore you.

26:40.080 --> 26:44.000
"And the apostle said
unto them, 'Is any sick among you?

26:44.560 --> 26:47.280
Let him summon the priests of the church.

26:48.560 --> 26:52.720
And let them pray over him,
anointing him with oil,

26:52.800 --> 26:55.960
in the name of the Lord.'"

26:56.920 --> 26:57.920
God is good.

27:16.160 --> 27:19.320
<i>Per istam sanctan</i>

27:19.400 --> 27:22.560
<i>unctionem et suam...</i>

27:23.680 --> 27:27.280
<i>piissimam misericordiam...</i>

27:28.960 --> 27:32.000
<i>indulgeat tibi...</i>

27:32.760 --> 27:38.920
<i>Dominus quidquid per visum...</i>

27:40.600 --> 27:42.080
<i>deliquisti.</i>

27:50.520 --> 27:52.400
Our friends in Mercia have sent word.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.240
They say the Lady Aethelflaed
has allies among the ealdormen,

27:56.320 --> 27:59.800
but there are more who harbor bitterness
at her successes.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.760
Then they will name Aelfweard as Lord
when the time comes?

28:02.840 --> 28:05.760
I believe most
will be led by their greed.

28:05.840 --> 28:06.680
Mm.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.480
You must leave immediately.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.160
Make sure the Witan feelsâ€¦

28:13.280 --> 28:14.680
â€¦adequately respected.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.720
What if the lady returns
before I reach the ealdormen?

28:17.800 --> 28:20.320
That cannot happen. You must reach
Aegelesburg before she does.

28:20.400 --> 28:24.520
I will follow with Aelfweard,
once I have broken the news to the king.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.600
The palace is stirring.

28:43.080 --> 28:48.400
I must not be seen here.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.520
- It is early yet.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.400
Your wife has engaged me
in duties of the court.

28:59.600 --> 29:03.520
I believe I am to divert my energies
towards the art of embroidery.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.120
- Ah.

29:06.080 --> 29:08.680
I hear she is greatly enthused
by a farm girl

29:08.760 --> 29:14.160
who was blessed with a visitation
from Stâ€¦ Cuthbert, I think.

29:15.400 --> 29:17.760
The queen wishes the ladies of Winchester

29:17.840 --> 29:20.760
to construct a grand tapestry
in the saint's honor.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.480
Of course she does.

29:23.280 --> 29:26.400
In truth, I think she wishes
to keep an eye on me.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.120
- I will deal with her.
- No, there's no need.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.760
I do not wish to cause her pain.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.440
You will return tonight?

29:45.040 --> 29:47.000
Is that my king's command?

29:48.600 --> 29:49.440
It is my hope.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.640
A thousand pardons for the hourâ€¦

30:04.480 --> 30:05.480
Lord Aethelhelm.

30:13.400 --> 30:14.240
Well?

30:19.680 --> 30:22.320
There is no easy way
to deliver news of this kind.

30:26.120 --> 30:29.240
I have received sad tidings from Mercia.

30:30.880 --> 30:34.040
Your sister is gravely ill, Lord King.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.160
She is not long for this world.

30:37.240 --> 30:38.320
Impossible.

30:39.600 --> 30:40.920
- There is no doubt.
- No.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.440
Why would your spies learn this
before the king?

30:44.520 --> 30:46.280
We have seen in the past

30:46.360 --> 30:52.560
how the matter of the Mercian succession
can give rise to disorder.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.040
I imagine the lady wished

30:55.120 --> 30:59.480
to keep the matter of her condition secret
for as long as possible.

31:00.680 --> 31:01.520
It cannot be.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.120
I am deeply sorry.

31:09.560 --> 31:13.440
Of course, this explains why
the lady did not raise the Mercian army

31:13.520 --> 31:14.720
to aid Eoferwic.

31:17.880 --> 31:22.400
In any case, there are reports
that Sigtryggr has recaptured his city.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.200
A small mercy.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.560
Thank you, Lord Aethelhelm.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.000
You will travel to Mercia?

31:42.040 --> 31:44.760
Forgive me,
I will intrude on your grief no longer.

31:58.440 --> 32:00.560
- Lord.
- Finan, did you find Pyrlig?

32:00.640 --> 32:03.120
Uh, I searched until nightfall,
there was no sign.

32:03.600 --> 32:07.480
- He must have traveled back to the king.
- That is not like him.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.640
Uhtred, forgive me. Weâ€¦ We must speak.

32:11.720 --> 32:14.640
We go after Brida.
We can talk on the journey.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.080
It's the Lady Aethelflaed.

32:39.600 --> 32:40.760
Lord Aldhelm!

32:42.880 --> 32:45.160
<i> She lives but her strength fades.</i>

32:45.240 --> 32:48.520
She doesn't want her condition to be known
until matters are resolved.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.760
She will need your help
to enter the palace.

33:24.440 --> 33:27.720
Sheâ€¦
She will not see the spring.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
But she was in good health in Rumcofa.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.720
You must be mistaken in this, Finan.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.400
Iâ€¦ I wish I was mistaken.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.720
She does not have long.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.240
And you concealed this from me?

34:02.720 --> 34:06.080
Eadith begged me to wait until the battle
was won before I told you.

34:06.560 --> 34:08.760
Your mind was on your daughter.
It would've been wrong

34:08.840 --> 34:10.560
for me to add to your troubles.

34:13.679 --> 34:14.880
I'm sorry, Uhtred.

34:23.159 --> 34:24.000
It cannot be.

34:25.960 --> 34:26.800
It cannot be.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.960
You have loved each other for many years.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.880
We've all seen it,
even if the lady cannot speak of it.

34:33.960 --> 34:38.679
So I know the pain you've carried
since she took her vow.

34:41.040 --> 34:45.360
She would want you to be with her, Uhtred.
You must go to her.

34:48.159 --> 34:50.360
I thought one day we mightâ€¦

34:52.840 --> 34:54.400
I thought there would be moreâ€¦

34:59.719 --> 35:01.520
There is so much I should have said.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.160
There's still time.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.760
We ride to Aegelesburg!

35:20.840 --> 35:21.680
Stiorra!

35:23.600 --> 35:25.480
- Father?

35:27.280 --> 35:28.120
Father?

35:33.120 --> 35:34.440
Lady Aethelflaed is dying.

35:35.840 --> 35:37.080
I'm so sorry, Father.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.520
I must go to her.

35:41.400 --> 35:45.400
If Mercia finds itself without a leader
once more, you must be careful.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.160
You could come with us.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.800
It could help
heal the rift between your lands.

35:52.520 --> 35:55.680
No, my place is here with Sigtryggr.

35:56.960 --> 35:57.960
Yes, it is.

36:44.560 --> 36:45.800
We must keep moving.

36:49.680 --> 36:52.920
What about the last one?
Should I kill him here?

36:56.960 --> 36:57.800
Umâ€¦

37:00.440 --> 37:01.320
He comes with us.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.600
The gods delivered him to me.

37:06.680 --> 37:07.840
They will show me why.

37:20.680 --> 37:21.520
Mother?

37:23.000 --> 37:23.840
I am here.

37:25.280 --> 37:27.960
Aelfwynn.
Whereâ€¦ Where is she?

37:28.960 --> 37:32.200
The child should not see you this way,
dear one.

37:32.720 --> 37:34.680
Let us wait until you are a little better.

37:34.760 --> 37:37.200
Aelfwynn must be named as my successor.

37:38.440 --> 37:41.040
If she is on the throne,
she will be protected.

37:43.360 --> 37:44.960
I will fetch Lady Aelfwynn.

37:48.080 --> 37:52.200
- He's here.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.680
- He's here. Come and look! Come!

37:58.920 --> 37:59.960
Hey!

38:05.800 --> 38:06.640
Lady Aelfwynn.

38:13.040 --> 38:13.880
Your mother.

38:15.160 --> 38:18.280
Is this about
how I brought shame on her in Rumcofa?

38:18.800 --> 38:20.720
What more can there be to say
on the matter?

38:20.800 --> 38:22.600
Lady Aethelflaed only wishes
to speak with you.

38:22.680 --> 38:25.240
My mother wishes only to chide me
for doing what she cannot.

38:25.320 --> 38:28.360
Your mother has given
everything she has for Mercia!

38:28.440 --> 38:30.920
To protect her people,
to protect you, her only child.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.680
You're not just her hope for the future of
this kingdom. You're her heart, Aelfwynn.

38:36.320 --> 38:37.480
She thinks only of you.

38:43.320 --> 38:46.960
Come. She is eager to see you.

38:57.600 --> 38:58.680
Do you understand?

39:02.160 --> 39:06.440
Knowing my daughter will be Lady of Mercia
in my stead, it is all I wish.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.880
It will mean you are safe, Aelfwynn.

39:12.520 --> 39:14.000
You must agree to this.

39:15.880 --> 39:18.160
- I'm not ready.
- Listen to me.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.800
Word of my condition will spread.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.040
There are those who would seek to take
the throne for their own advancement.

39:26.120 --> 39:27.280
If they are successful,

39:27.360 --> 39:30.400
the first thing they will do is ensure
my daughter is disposed of.

39:31.080 --> 39:32.880
You frighten the child.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.560
She needs to know the truth.
There is no time...

39:38.520 --> 39:39.360
It fades.

39:40.880 --> 39:41.720
Mother.

39:43.440 --> 39:44.800
Do you suffer greatly?

39:46.520 --> 39:48.440
Do not be afraid.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.400
I know there is much you must sacrifice.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.600
It is a choice I also faced.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.600
I do not pretend it was easy.

40:03.880 --> 40:05.200
But you will not be alone.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.640
I will be strong.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.960
I'll do as you wish.
I'll serve as queen when you're gone.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.000
The Witan will stand behind you.

40:25.360 --> 40:26.520
I am sure of it.

40:34.600 --> 40:35.960
Come now, Aelfwynn.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.520
Let us visit the church together.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.480
Mother?

40:53.720 --> 40:55.440
You must rest.

41:14.360 --> 41:16.760
It pains her
to see you this way.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.960
It is a dreadful thing toâ€¦

41:21.920 --> 41:23.680
to face the loss of a child.

41:27.680 --> 41:29.400
I hope you know I am grateful.

41:30.600 --> 41:35.440
Oh, uhâ€¦
Lady, there's noâ€¦ no need.

41:38.440 --> 41:41.560
Will you do me one more service,
Lord Aldhelm?

41:43.880 --> 41:44.960
Anything.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.720
My daughter is young and willful.

41:52.320 --> 41:53.680
I know she is not ready.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.480
You must be her guide.

41:58.120 --> 41:58.960
Her advisor.

42:00.920 --> 42:01.760
She needs you.

42:03.040 --> 42:05.200
Mercia needs you.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.800
Of course. It will be my honor.

42:12.880 --> 42:14.960
No one has served Mercia more faithfully.

42:18.680 --> 42:20.800
We must act quickly.

42:21.520 --> 42:24.000
I will seek out the ealdormen.

42:26.960 --> 42:29.920
Thank you, Aldhelm.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.960
If this sad news is true,

43:01.040 --> 43:04.680
how is it Wessex has learned of it
before the ealdormen of Mercia?

43:04.760 --> 43:08.560
Lord Aethelhelm has many friends
across the kingdoms.

43:12.320 --> 43:16.480
All of you know the young Lady Aelfwynn
is not fit to rule.

43:19.800 --> 43:23.120
Does your master propose
an alternative solution?

43:23.200 --> 43:24.920
He does indeed, Lord Burgred.

43:25.880 --> 43:27.600
One he trusts you will all findâ€¦

43:28.680 --> 43:30.040
â€¦advantageous.

43:52.720 --> 43:56.240
We are greatly blessed to welcome Aalys
and her pilgrims to Winchester.

43:56.320 --> 43:57.480
Indeed.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.520
This is the young woman from Lewes?

44:00.160 --> 44:03.320
You see, the tapestry tells
of the deeds of St. Cuthbert,

44:03.400 --> 44:05.560
the saint she was visited by.

44:05.640 --> 44:07.320
Hm, remarkable.

44:08.320 --> 44:12.080
It is important the people see
your recognition of this miracle, Edward.

44:13.560 --> 44:15.080
Are you pleased with our work?

44:15.160 --> 44:18.760
God's glory shines through your laborers,
my Lady.

44:19.720 --> 44:22.560
We will be glad to carry your offering
to the Holy Isle.

44:23.600 --> 44:27.440
- You will take this to Lindisfarne?
- With your approval, Lord King.

44:28.880 --> 44:32.400
You see, when I heard Aalys was making
the pilgrimage to the Holy Isle,

44:32.480 --> 44:35.440
I knew you'd like to make
a king's blessing to their offering.

44:35.520 --> 44:37.560
It means so much to your people.

44:41.520 --> 44:44.960
Of course.
God be with you on your journey.

44:53.560 --> 44:56.760
Do you understand
that your show of piety may be seen

44:56.840 --> 44:59.120
as Wessex laying claim to the Holy Isle?

45:00.640 --> 45:03.360
King Constantin wants Lindisfarne
for Scotland.

45:03.440 --> 45:06.120
He could see this
as a deliberate act of provocation.

45:07.240 --> 45:08.200
I did not know.

45:11.160 --> 45:12.200
You did not ask.

45:20.280 --> 45:21.480
Lady.

45:22.520 --> 45:24.680
God knows your heart.

45:25.480 --> 45:28.520
- He feels your pain as His own.

45:29.520 --> 45:30.640
I will pray for you.

45:31.760 --> 45:36.760
That you will know God's will
for your life and His peace in your heart.

45:44.320 --> 45:47.760
This is not the moment
for you to provoke the king's displeasure.

45:47.840 --> 45:49.000
He disrespects me.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.440
And you will bear it
for the sake of your son.

45:52.320 --> 45:54.800
He is the only reason
we have a place here.

45:54.880 --> 45:57.440
I am aware of that,
but I'm tired of waiting--

45:57.520 --> 46:01.120
Aelfweard will be Lord of Mercia
within the week.

46:02.400 --> 46:06.520
There will be a Witan
when the Lady Aethelflaed dies.

46:06.600 --> 46:10.440
And my grandson will be named
her successor.

46:13.840 --> 46:17.000
He has bribed the Mercian ealdormen.
It is the only explanation.

46:17.560 --> 46:19.720
How long has he known
of my sister's plight?

46:21.320 --> 46:22.240
What will you do?

46:26.240 --> 46:27.520
Lord Aethelhelm.

46:33.480 --> 46:35.160
I will ride to Aegelesburg.

46:36.600 --> 46:39.760
God willing, my sister will be spared
long enough to receive us.

46:41.480 --> 46:42.960
A wise decision, Lord.

46:45.720 --> 46:49.760
I think it would be right if your son
were to travel with the delegation,

46:49.840 --> 46:51.840
Aelfweard is very fond of his aunt.

46:55.160 --> 46:57.320
Perhaps I could accompany him?

47:03.040 --> 47:05.320
He may be some comfort
to his cousin Aelfwynn.

47:06.880 --> 47:07.800
The poor girl.

47:18.320 --> 47:20.880
You'll see her, Lord.
We'll not be too late!

47:26.000 --> 47:29.640
Sigtryggr! Brother!

47:31.000 --> 47:32.600
Sigtryggr!

47:32.680 --> 47:33.800
Sigtryggr!

47:34.640 --> 47:36.520
Sigtryggr!

47:37.000 --> 47:37.840
Brother!

47:39.240 --> 47:40.520
Sigtryggr!

47:41.440 --> 47:45.360
- Sigtryggr! Brother!

47:49.680 --> 47:53.400
I know it is not an easy thing,
to condemn your brother to die.

47:56.320 --> 47:58.040
We are family!

48:04.480 --> 48:05.920
You are tenderhearted.

48:07.520 --> 48:08.720
That's why I love you.

48:09.520 --> 48:12.280
I know I must act.

48:13.080 --> 48:14.800
He must answer for his crimes.

48:19.240 --> 48:21.840
But all my life
I have protected him.

48:28.400 --> 48:29.680
I do not know what to do.

48:30.480 --> 48:32.640
He does not deserve your mercy.

48:35.200 --> 48:37.160
Perhaps we could let the gods decide.

48:46.480 --> 48:47.320
Brother.

48:49.400 --> 48:50.960
Brother!

49:01.160 --> 49:02.120
Brother.

49:04.200 --> 49:05.920
We are decided.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.560
You may choose a quick death here,
or you may trust your fate

49:09.640 --> 49:13.000
to a public trial,
but you must choose now.

49:13.080 --> 49:17.560
A trial?

49:17.640 --> 49:20.600
It's what you pretended to want
when you came here, wasn't it?

49:20.680 --> 49:23.000
A trial for your people under Danelaw?

49:32.080 --> 49:33.040
I know you.

49:34.080 --> 49:36.040
I know you are just.

49:36.960 --> 49:38.080
You're merciful.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.360
You will not condemn me.

49:42.440 --> 49:43.280
Choose!

50:23.280 --> 50:24.720
You brought them here!

50:43.200 --> 50:46.600
The prisoner will take the bar
in both hands!

50:46.680 --> 50:48.800
He will take nine steps,

50:48.880 --> 50:51.760
for the nine nights Odin hung
on the great tree.

50:51.840 --> 50:56.640
If he succeeds, the gods have favored him
and he will be pardoned.

50:57.680 --> 51:00.560
But if he fails, the gods have cursed him.

51:03.240 --> 51:05.240
And my sword is ready!

51:10.040 --> 51:11.120
Brother, Iâ€¦

51:12.520 --> 51:13.760
We begin!
