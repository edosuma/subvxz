00:13.514 --> 00:16.417
*

00:36.570 --> 00:42.110
* I look at you

00:42.143 --> 00:47.748
* And before my eyes,
it's true *

00:47.781 --> 00:54.555
* That the girl of my dreams

00:54.588 --> 01:00.561
* Is not quite what she seems

01:00.594 --> 01:06.400
* Open your door

01:06.434 --> 01:12.473
* Turn on the light

01:12.506 --> 01:18.512
* Show me some more

01:18.546 --> 01:24.785
* Tell me it's all right

01:24.818 --> 01:29.757
* Heaven is inside you

01:29.790 --> 01:36.264
* Heaven when I write you

01:36.297 --> 01:42.403
* Heaven, do you want me?

01:42.436 --> 01:47.775
* Is Hell just in my mind?

01:52.346 --> 01:53.681
(camera shutter snaps)

01:59.853 --> 02:02.856
*

02:12.600 --> 02:18.806
* Heaven is inside you

02:18.839 --> 02:25.213
* Heaven when I write you

02:25.246 --> 02:30.384
* Heaven, do you want me?

02:30.418 --> 02:36.424
* Heaven,
do you want me? *

02:36.457 --> 02:41.762
* Is Hell just in my mind?

02:41.795 --> 02:43.897
So, you working on
a little extra credit?

02:43.931 --> 02:45.933
It's kind of a thought exercise.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.301
DAVID:
About two dozen

02:47.335 --> 02:48.702
unsolved murders.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.439
I mean, it looks
pretty real to me.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.806
Ever since Don got hurt,

02:52.840 --> 02:55.309
I can't stop thinking
every violent act is,

02:55.343 --> 02:56.910
to some degree, explicable.

02:56.944 --> 02:57.745
You got a lot of different

02:57.778 --> 03:00.214
M.O.s here,
different victim types:

03:00.248 --> 03:01.915
men, women, children;

03:01.949 --> 03:04.918
shot, stabbed,
strangled, bludgeoned.

03:04.952 --> 03:07.688
Three of these are
pedestrian hit-and-runs.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.557
But there is a timeline pattern.

03:09.590 --> 03:10.824
You found a pattern in all this?

03:10.858 --> 03:14.528
Yep. By using some of the same
mathematical concepts that look

03:14.562 --> 03:16.864
for signs of intelligent life
in our universe.

03:17.798 --> 03:18.932
Ah, yeah, of course.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.903
It's not as "out there"
as it seems.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.939
The universe creates
an endless background

03:25.973 --> 03:28.242
of electromagnetic static.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.811
SETI-- the Search for
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence--

03:30.844 --> 03:34.782
uses algorithms to sift through
all this random cosmic noise

03:34.815 --> 03:37.918
to find a signal
that is complex yet repetitive,

03:37.951 --> 03:41.455
a non-natural pattern
created by an intelligence.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.791
I've adapted the signal
detection algorithm

03:43.824 --> 03:47.628
to analyze the pattern,
and I got...

03:47.661 --> 03:49.863
this spatio-temporal
visualization model.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.899
Its sequence is half lunar.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.602
It's indicative
of a recurring emotional need,

03:54.635 --> 03:56.804
buffered by planning
and surveillance.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.940
Okay, but if the M.O.s and
the victims are all different?

03:59.973 --> 04:01.442
He's a different type
of serial killer.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.045
All right.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.014
DAVID:
He's working

04:07.047 --> 04:08.382
on a theory.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.850
Serial killer nobody's

04:09.883 --> 04:11.018
noticed but him.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.620
How does he figure?

04:12.653 --> 04:15.823
Signals from deep space.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.626
Seems a little outside
the box, even for Charlie.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.628
Yeah, thing is,
a few years ago,

04:20.661 --> 04:22.996
Don got shot at a bank robbery
that Charlie had predicted.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.032
He retreated to his garage,

04:25.065 --> 04:28.869
and he buried himself
in an unsolvable math problem.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.671
Been in here 24/7
the past five days.

04:30.704 --> 04:31.539
LIZ:
You know, there's a

04:31.572 --> 04:33.407
symptom of posttraumatic
stress disorder

04:33.441 --> 04:34.542
called hypervigilance.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.943
Means you're always
looking out

04:35.976 --> 04:37.711
for potential
danger and threats,

04:37.745 --> 04:39.079
thinking you see it.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.648
And it's not really there.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.763
Oh. Trying to scare
me to death.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.031
What are you doing at the FBI
till 3:00 in the morning?

04:58.065 --> 04:59.032
Nothing.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.001
Nothing, huh?

05:01.034 --> 05:02.670
(groans)

05:02.703 --> 05:04.372
You're working some serial case.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.574
David told me.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.342
He thinks I'm overreacting?

05:08.376 --> 05:09.777
Charlie, hey,

05:09.810 --> 05:11.011
this isn't your fault.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.946
I know that.

05:12.980 --> 05:13.981
Well, you got to move on.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.116
Since when have
you ever moved on?

05:16.149 --> 05:17.485
Since I got stabbed.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.986
Sooner or later,
we're both

05:19.019 --> 05:21.389
gonna have to learn
we can't solve every problem.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.533
(truck backup warning beeping)

05:39.573 --> 05:42.576
Hey! Call 911!

05:56.424 --> 05:58.426
Ah, Betancourt,
thanks for coming.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.828
Yeah, no problem, JJ.
Whatcha got?

06:00.861 --> 06:03.096
Postal worker halfway
through his rounds

06:03.130 --> 06:05.866
popped in the head,
small-caliber, close-range.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.501
And what's he doing
in the alley?

06:07.535 --> 06:10.404
A resident says he uses
the alleyway as a shortcut.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.805
Maybe somebody
knew his routine.

06:11.839 --> 06:14.608
But your guy's working
on that angle.

06:14.642 --> 06:15.776
My guy?

06:15.809 --> 06:17.811
Yeah, the professor.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.848
He's yours, isn't he?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.683
Yeah. Yeah, he's ours.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.652
Well, the pattern isn't perfect.

06:24.685 --> 06:28.021
I mean, there are micro-clusters
that are currently anomalous.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.425
But the overall pattern is
extraordinarily regular,

06:31.459 --> 06:32.259
which is indicative...

06:32.292 --> 06:34.161
How many murders
in a micro-cluster?

06:34.194 --> 06:35.763
Two. Mostly.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.731
- Sometimes three.
- That's very micro.

06:37.765 --> 06:38.832
Yeah, but those are outliers.

06:38.866 --> 06:42.970
The macro-pattern is persistent,
statistically valid.

06:43.003 --> 06:46.707
Charlie, we both started here
on the same case five years ago.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.141
Okay? You know
I'm a believer

06:48.175 --> 06:50.511
- in what you do.
- And I'm asking for a lot.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.813
Working your theory would take
hundreds of man-hours.

06:52.846 --> 06:53.881
Everybody's already busy

06:53.914 --> 06:56.149
on confirmed crimes;
if I tried

06:56.183 --> 06:58.452
to reassign agents to work a
serial case

06:58.486 --> 06:59.152
that had no serial elements,

06:59.186 --> 07:00.954
outside of a
timeline pattern

07:00.988 --> 07:02.590
discovered by a mathematician,

07:02.623 --> 07:03.924
I mean, I'd get fired.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.627
This is what he's counting on.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.795
Excuse me?

07:07.828 --> 07:08.496
He knows serial killers

07:08.529 --> 07:10.764
get caught because of patterns,

07:10.798 --> 07:12.733
telltale traits,
compulsive behavior,

07:12.766 --> 07:17.137
so he switches his M.O.s,
his weapons, victim types

07:17.170 --> 07:18.071
on purpose.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.809
No repetitive behavior
means no pattern.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.811
No reason to expend
law enforcement resources

07:23.844 --> 07:25.245
to find one.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.915
All right, what do
you want me to do, Charlie?

07:27.948 --> 07:30.518
SETI telescopes--
always gathering data.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.786
I need more data.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.788
I'll take anything
you can give me.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.089
Okay, all right.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.626
There's a lot of
amateur work being done

07:38.659 --> 07:39.660
for serial killer data,

07:39.693 --> 07:42.129
and some of it is
surprisingly comprehensive.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.664
- Amateur work.
- Yeah. Uh...

07:43.697 --> 07:45.733
there's a guy we worked with
on a recent case.

07:45.766 --> 07:46.934
You should meet him.

07:51.539 --> 07:52.840
Good afternoon.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.508
- Huh?
- Hi. I'm...

07:54.542 --> 07:55.776
Oh! Professor!

07:55.809 --> 07:56.977
Welcome.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.812
Roy McGill. Oh, welcome!

07:58.846 --> 08:00.848
Hi. Such a pleasure.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.082
Hey, would you mind locking up?

08:02.115 --> 08:03.584
Thanks, buddy.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.785
Certainly.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.220
Oh, please forgive
the, uh, concrete decor.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.922
Nature of my
work requires

08:08.956 --> 08:10.724
an enhanced level of security.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.731
(whispers):
Welcome to the Truth Cave.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.299
You like it?
Pretty cool, right?

08:19.332 --> 08:20.934
Pretty cool.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.003
(quiet, high-pitched):
Yeah!

08:23.971 --> 08:24.972
You hungry?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.674
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.542
Oh! You got to hear this.

08:28.576 --> 08:29.342
Heads up.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.780
(whispers):
Watch this. Wait for it.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.815
Wait for it.
This'll be good.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.116
(eerie whirring)

08:36.149 --> 08:38.085
You know what that is?
Of course you don't.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.688
That's a sound recording
of a UFO

08:40.721 --> 08:41.789
from a Russian
friend of mine.

08:41.822 --> 08:42.823
Code name: Teeger Woods.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.758
Like Tiger Woods, but not.

08:44.792 --> 08:45.959
Huh?

08:45.993 --> 08:47.961
Art Bell's gonna run it
on his show tonight.

08:47.995 --> 08:52.065
Actually, I'm, um, I'm just here
to talk to you about...

08:52.099 --> 08:53.767
Serial killer, right?

08:53.801 --> 08:54.868
You know how I knew that?

08:54.902 --> 08:56.303
I have ESP.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.271
I don't have ESP.
I'm totally messing with you.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.340
Agent Sinclair
told me. Oh!

09:00.373 --> 09:01.875
Freakin' awesome, man!

09:01.909 --> 09:04.277
I always knew you and I
were gonna team up.

09:04.311 --> 09:05.679
I always knew it.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.781
I'm really just here
to collect some data...

09:07.815 --> 09:09.683
I'm a little surprised
it took the FBI so long.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.318
I mean, I've only got
the sixth most popular blog

09:11.351 --> 09:13.086
on serial killers.
(laughs)

09:13.120 --> 09:14.855
Oh. Do you want this seat?

09:14.888 --> 09:15.756
I'm fine.

09:15.789 --> 09:16.757
Oh, so am I.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.191
It's pretty comfortable.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.226
Oh!

09:19.259 --> 09:20.360
Hey, look at this.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.063
So, I found two murders

09:23.096 --> 09:26.900
that fit into your,
uh, timeline pattern.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.102
I tried to find
things that fit

09:29.136 --> 09:31.104
into the, uh, spatio-tempura

09:31.138 --> 09:33.340
that Agent Sinclair
sent me.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.776
By the look of it,
I didn't do a good job.

09:35.809 --> 09:36.777
I was really hoping

09:36.810 --> 09:38.378
to find more data than this.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.713
Not a problem.

09:39.747 --> 09:43.016
Not... a... problem.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.352
(whispers):
And we're off!

09:45.385 --> 09:47.855
Where are we going?

09:47.888 --> 09:51.191
Serial killer data central.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.761
(quiet, high-pitched):
Yeah!

09:53.794 --> 09:54.862
Gene Evans.

09:54.895 --> 09:55.929
CHARLIE:
It's a pleasure.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.065
You guys should have,
like, some sort of, like,

09:58.098 --> 09:59.366
you know, crazy,
uh, math handshake.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.902
Gene's into numbers, too.
Gene's an accountant.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.837
Mm, retired.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.906
Uh, and,
tabulating taxes

10:05.939 --> 10:07.975
hardly qualifies
as math the way

10:08.008 --> 10:09.977
Professor Eppes knows it.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.011
Gene is part of a network--

10:11.044 --> 10:12.913
amateurs who help
with police investigations.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.148
The number of missing persons
and unsolved murders

10:15.182 --> 10:18.151
can overwhelm most
agencies, so there's

10:18.185 --> 10:19.920
hundreds of us
around the country,

10:19.953 --> 10:23.390
and we... gather and tabulate
data as much as we can.

10:23.423 --> 10:26.326
Gene solved four missing person
cases in California

10:26.359 --> 10:28.395
and a murder case in Oregon.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.998
Well, "assisted" would be
closer to the truth.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.933
But the fact is, I stopped.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.135
Couple of years ago,
I got a bunch

10:35.168 --> 10:38.806
of phone calls, probably just
cranks, but it spooked the wife.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.407
Well, any information
you can provide

10:40.440 --> 10:42.142
would be much appreciated
here, Gene.

10:42.175 --> 10:45.112
When Roy described
your theory...

10:45.145 --> 10:47.314
something came to mind.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.316
These aren't
L.A.-area cases.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.886
They're all from up near, uh,
Fresno and Bakersfield.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.254
And several years ago.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.089
Yeah, but...

10:56.123 --> 10:57.691
the time patterns,

10:57.725 --> 10:59.960
the knowledge
of the victims' routines,

10:59.993 --> 11:01.762
uh, very similar.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.296
And-and then there's this.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.003
That's a constrictor knot.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.071
Simple and secure,

11:11.104 --> 11:13.073
but once you
get it tight,

11:13.106 --> 11:15.976
it's very difficult
to untie.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.046
Same knot was used in five of
the cases you're looking into.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.948
Whoa. Freaky.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.050
Have you shown any of this
to the police?

11:23.083 --> 11:25.753
Yes. A detective up
in Bakersfield.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.020
Brent Driscoll.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.961
LARRY: Charlie, you're living
and working

11:33.994 --> 11:35.262
out of boxes now.
You've become

11:35.295 --> 11:36.797
a previous incarnation of me.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.431
AMITA: What's taking you so
long?

11:38.465 --> 11:40.133
Do you need some help?

11:40.167 --> 11:41.769
I'm too busy.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.804
I need to find the
missing pieces here.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.072
Make one mistake,
people get hurt.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.375
Cognitive emergence work.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.778
God, you haven't even
touched this since Don's injury.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.112
AMITA:
Have you ever considered

11:52.145 --> 11:53.847
this might be an overreaction?

11:53.881 --> 11:54.848
My theory's correct.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.149
If you want to say that this is

11:56.183 --> 11:57.450
a reaction to Don's situation,
go ahead.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.086
No, I mean,

11:59.119 --> 12:01.354
come on, you're an
applied mathematician.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.424
You're applying math
to a problem.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.494
And there's something to be said
for cathartic endeavors.

12:07.527 --> 12:10.030
Well, let's say,
for hypothetical reasons,

12:10.063 --> 12:11.098
that I'm not crazy,

12:11.131 --> 12:13.000
that my timeline
pattern is correct.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.768
Let's say that there is

12:14.802 --> 12:17.037
a serial killer who
has avoided detection.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.006
Why the anomalies
in the timeline?

12:19.039 --> 12:20.073
Why the micro-clusters?

12:20.107 --> 12:21.141
What am I missing?

12:21.174 --> 12:24.411
Well, whatever is missing
lies beyond all of this.

12:24.444 --> 12:28.315
You seek to quantify
a single individual in some

12:28.348 --> 12:31.384
elegant, mathematical pattern.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.521
But the universe is full of
all these odd bumps and twists.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.523
And so are people.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.358
Now, perhaps your approach
needs to be

12:38.391 --> 12:41.161
less elegant, more complicated.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.931
Haven't we had
this conversation before?

12:43.964 --> 12:47.835
Well, now,
cosmologically speaking,

12:47.868 --> 12:50.804
everything that happens
has happened before.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.212
Can I help you find something?

12:59.246 --> 13:01.882
Yeah, I think I left
something in here, some files.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.016
For your serial killer case?

13:04.317 --> 13:06.386
It's an office;
people talk.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.488
So everyone thinks I'm crazy.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.522
You know about Kim Rossmo?

13:09.556 --> 13:11.424
Canadian detective,

13:11.458 --> 13:12.826
mathematician.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.127
His work on
geographic profiling

13:14.161 --> 13:16.196
was, was groundbreaking.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.430
Rossmo identified the same type

13:17.464 --> 13:19.099
of serial killer
as you're looking for--

13:19.132 --> 13:21.468
one that deliberately hides
any signs of a criminal pattern.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.303
He called them
stealth predators.

13:23.336 --> 13:26.039
They try to commit crimes
in such a way

13:26.073 --> 13:27.474
that the authorities
aren't even aware of it.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.176
Really?

13:29.209 --> 13:32.045
In Vancouver, he did something a
lot like what you're doing--

13:32.079 --> 13:34.147
working only off of a pattern.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.116
The police didn't believe
his theory that a cluster

13:36.149 --> 13:38.118
of disappearances was
the work of a single killer.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.119
So they fire Rossmo.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.454
Ten more deaths later,

13:41.488 --> 13:42.990
they realize that he's right.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.157
So they caught the killer

13:44.191 --> 13:46.927
with 31 bodies
buried on his property.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.097
I'd love to see
Rossmo's methodology.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.132
Had a feeling
you might be interested.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.971
Thanks, Matt.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.959
(screams)

14:18.992 --> 14:20.160
You're in my spot here.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.295
(groans)

14:22.329 --> 14:22.963
I fell asleep.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.165
I just had
the worst dream.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.267
I wonder why.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.436
What are you doing here?

14:29.469 --> 14:32.605
I like it here.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.274
I don't know what
it is, you know?

14:34.307 --> 14:36.043
I been shot.
I been beaten.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.477
How many sports
did I play as a kid?

14:37.510 --> 14:39.112
And I-I've never been
laid up like this.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.148
You got stabbed.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.184
How can you be so calm about it?

14:44.217 --> 14:46.653
Well, I mean, I survived,
for one thing.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.322
Who are you?

14:49.356 --> 14:50.890
What have you done
with my brother?

14:52.025 --> 14:53.360
I don't know, Charlie.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.195
All I can tell you
is I feel like

14:55.228 --> 14:57.364
job just doesn't own me anymore.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.598
Yeah?

14:58.631 --> 15:01.334
Well, that's got to be
the meds talking.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.502
Where you going?

15:02.535 --> 15:04.037
I might as well work.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.973
I don't want to have
another dream like that one.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.253
Uh...

15:20.287 --> 15:22.522
Charles?

15:22.555 --> 15:24.457
Hey.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.728
Um...

15:28.761 --> 15:29.762
is everything okay?

15:29.796 --> 15:34.334
My search for a non-random
signal has revealed

15:34.367 --> 15:35.602
not only an intelligence,

15:35.635 --> 15:39.106
but an extremely careful
and shrewd intelligence.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.607
It's not one area; it's three.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.275
He moves.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.443
What, the serial killer?

15:43.476 --> 15:45.345
Yeah. It became apparent
when I combined

15:45.378 --> 15:47.480
Gene Evans' data with
Kim Rossmo's methodology

15:47.514 --> 15:50.017
that this killer is
a stealth predator.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.185
He knows that too many murders
in one area gets attention,

15:52.219 --> 15:54.221
and so he moves.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.222
Terrific.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.024
A super-smart killer.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.625
Who's struck
three times in 18 years,

15:58.658 --> 16:00.693
starting in Northern California,

16:00.727 --> 16:02.562
and then
the Fresno-Bakersfield area,

16:02.595 --> 16:04.331
and now he's here.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.305
It's good to see you.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.306
Bye.

16:13.340 --> 16:16.176
Bye.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.410
Oh, dear.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.519
McGILL:
You do realize 7:00

16:26.553 --> 16:28.255
is an inhuman hour
to be calling somebody.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.056
We're very
close, Roy.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.523
I just need a
little more data,

16:30.557 --> 16:32.192
and I'm thinking
Gene's gonna have it.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.428
Oh, man, this is gonna blow
the doors off the Zodiac,

16:35.462 --> 16:37.364
Bundy, the Red Ripper.

16:44.271 --> 16:45.605
(calling out):
Gene?

16:45.638 --> 16:47.440
Martha?

16:49.576 --> 16:50.510
Hello?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.483
(dryer whirring)

16:56.516 --> 16:58.518
Let's check the garage.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.424
Well, car's still here.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.600
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.578
Gene Evans and his wife
don't fit the macro-pattern.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.814
They fit the pattern
of micro-clusters.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.216
What interests me is that

17:29.249 --> 17:31.084
Evans collected data
on the killings.

17:31.118 --> 17:33.553
Police interviewed a witness who
was driving by the Evans' house

17:33.586 --> 17:34.721
near the time of the killing.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.223
This is the description he gave

17:36.256 --> 17:37.490
of a man
he saw walking

17:37.524 --> 17:38.625
across their
front yard.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.529
Uh, David,
sheriff's homicide's asking

17:42.562 --> 17:44.164
if we're working
the Evans murder with them.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.332
Tell them we're looking at it

17:45.365 --> 17:46.866
for a possible link
to an FBI case.

17:46.899 --> 17:47.700
Okay.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.436
Do I tell them
we suspect a serial?

17:49.469 --> 17:51.704
No. Not yet.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.705
First, we need to see
if anybody

17:52.739 --> 17:55.508
had an ordinary motive
for killing Gene Evans.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.145
Want to be sure.

18:00.613 --> 18:04.584
My brother Gene and his wife
Martha were good people.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.286
What happened to them is wrong.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.788
Is there anyone who would
want to hurt them?

18:08.821 --> 18:11.291
I thought you knew
about that already.

18:11.324 --> 18:14.294
Former client said
Gene made a mistake

18:14.327 --> 18:16.863
on his taxes,
cost him his life savings.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.898
He threatened my brother.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.833
They had to get
a restraining order.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.902
There's police reports
and everything.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.637
The guy's a nut.

18:24.671 --> 18:25.705
What's this guy's name?

18:25.738 --> 18:26.806
Mark Horn.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.878
COLBY: You said you saw someone
outside the Evans' house

18:31.911 --> 18:33.480
the night that he and his wife

18:33.513 --> 18:34.681
were killed.

18:34.714 --> 18:35.815
Now, could this be the man?

18:35.848 --> 18:38.518
It was dark.

18:38.551 --> 18:41.288
And, like I told the sheriff's
detectives, you know,

18:41.321 --> 18:44.291
he had a jacket on
with the hood pulled up.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.792
But...

18:45.825 --> 18:48.361
yeah, that looks like him.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.230
Thank you.

18:50.263 --> 18:53.700
Uh, that guy, have you
arrested him yet?

18:55.902 --> 18:57.870
Guys, what about me
and my family?

18:57.904 --> 19:00.607
Are we gonna be
a target now?

19:08.348 --> 19:09.749
Whoa! Hey!

19:09.782 --> 19:10.850
Who are you?

19:10.883 --> 19:11.851
Why you going through
Charlie's stuff?

19:11.884 --> 19:13.853
I happen to be
Professor Lawrence Fleinhardt,

19:13.886 --> 19:16.923
holder of the Walter T. Merrick
Chair in Theoretical Physics.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.425
Oh, yeah? Can you prove it?

19:18.458 --> 19:20.460
Yes, if you'd care to hear
a lecture on

19:20.493 --> 19:23.296
the photoelectric properties
of Ly-Alpha emitters

19:23.330 --> 19:24.797
in a QZ2 plane universe.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.434
I-I have no idea
what just happened.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.602
But why are you going through
Charlie's stuff?

19:29.636 --> 19:31.838
Because, my young friend,
I think I have

19:31.871 --> 19:33.773
a Green Lantern book
in here somewhere.

19:33.806 --> 19:36.543
(whispers):
Green Lantern!

19:36.576 --> 19:38.978
"In brightest day,
in blackest night..."

19:39.011 --> 19:40.247
Yeah.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.581
"No evil shall escape my sight."

19:41.614 --> 19:42.582
Sight!

19:42.615 --> 19:44.951
(laughs):
I love the Lant.

19:44.984 --> 19:45.985
(sighs):
Oh. Yeah.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.920
Yeah. Charlie and I, we're, uh,

19:47.954 --> 19:50.690
we're investigating
a little FBI case. Shh.

19:50.723 --> 19:51.991
(whispers):
Keep it on the D.L.

19:52.024 --> 19:52.925
Oh, wait, so you must be

19:52.959 --> 19:53.926
the consultant, uh,
who specializes in,

19:53.960 --> 19:56.696
well, let's call them
unusual explanations.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.899
I think the Bureau refers to me
as "the conspiracy nut."

19:59.932 --> 20:01.701
Some of history's
greatest minds

20:01.734 --> 20:04.371
have been rejected
by society at large.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.706
(whispers):
Whoa, you're one of us!

20:06.739 --> 20:10.543
Well, actually, I prefer
the term "conspiracist."

20:10.577 --> 20:12.712
I drop the word
"nut" altogether.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.548
For example, I don't put
too much stock in cryptozoology.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.250
Oh, well, you should
take a look at

20:17.284 --> 20:18.751
my, uh, Bigfoot Web site
sometime.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.553
(chuckles) You'll be singing
a whole different tune.

20:20.587 --> 20:23.656
It's the same old lyric: silly
men dressed up in gorilla suits.

20:23.690 --> 20:24.857
McGILL: Oh, Charlie! Hey, good
timing.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.759
Oh, I got something important
to show you.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.461
Why don't you, uh,
step into my office.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.797
Your office. I was
just kidding with you.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.399
So, I took a look at

20:32.432 --> 20:34.801
your whole three-area idea,

20:34.834 --> 20:36.969
and I think I might have
identified a victim zero.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.505
High school girl

20:38.538 --> 20:40.373
murdered in 1988.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.041
Nancy Kershaw, 17.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.511
Found in a wooded area
near a public park.

20:44.544 --> 20:45.878
What's your criteria

20:45.912 --> 20:47.480
for identifying her
as a victim zero?

20:47.514 --> 20:48.881
My cr-- for identifying...

20:48.915 --> 20:50.750
I love your hair, by the way.

20:50.783 --> 20:51.884
Um, well,

20:51.918 --> 20:55.655
I took the earliest of
the three areas you identified--

20:55.688 --> 20:59.058
Stockton-- and I, uh,
looked for previous murders.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.159
LARRY:
If I may,

21:00.192 --> 21:02.895
you know, not all the people
murdered in that area

21:02.929 --> 21:04.431
can be linked to a cluster.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.798
This guy-- he's good.

21:05.832 --> 21:06.899
I got a copy of
the M.E.'s report.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.067
Check it out.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.303
See, right there.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.671
CHARLIE:
Constrictor knot.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.307
But that's not unique
to all these cases.

21:14.341 --> 21:15.542
If she is Victim Zero,

21:15.575 --> 21:17.910
serial killers will often start
with somebody that they know

21:17.944 --> 21:18.978
or live close to.

21:19.011 --> 21:19.979
Uh-huh.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.013
It's true.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.049
Nancy Kershaw had a boyfriend.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.150
A week after she
was killed,

21:24.183 --> 21:26.419
somebody claiming to be
the murderer called him up,

21:26.453 --> 21:28.755
threatened
to kill him, too.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.089
I'm good.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.426
Guys, I should be doing
this for a living.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.663
NIKKI: Gene Evans' disgruntled
client Mark Horn

21:36.696 --> 21:38.431
used a credit card

21:38.465 --> 21:40.667
at a gas station three miles
from the Evans' house

21:40.700 --> 21:41.968
on the night of the murders.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.003
Might not be good
for Charlie's serial theory.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.072
But it's good for solving
the Evans murder case.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.116
Mark Horn.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.118
I didn't do anything wrong!

21:59.151 --> 22:01.354
You got no reason
to arrest me!

22:01.388 --> 22:03.055
- Oh, yeah?
- Well, I guess

22:03.089 --> 22:03.890
we have
a difference

22:03.923 --> 22:05.825
of opinion. Come on.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.961
I was watching my daughter.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.563
You aren't allowed
around your daughter

22:10.597 --> 22:11.631
without her mother's permission.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.401
She is my daughter! Damn it.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.035
Why'd you lose custody?

22:16.068 --> 22:17.103
My wife didn't

22:17.136 --> 22:19.439
understand that I have to fight
for what is mine.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.407
NIKKI:
Gene Evans.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.108
He had a restraining order out
against you.

22:22.141 --> 22:23.109
- You violated it.
- Yeah.

22:23.142 --> 22:26.779
I wound up in a county jail when
I am the victim!

22:26.813 --> 22:30.783
I am not the one
they should be locking up.

22:30.817 --> 22:31.451
Who is?

22:31.484 --> 22:33.986
Gene Evans.

22:34.020 --> 22:34.987
Evans is dead.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.989
You went to his house
the night he was killed.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.094
I only drove by.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.497
Evans got that restraining order
out against you

22:44.531 --> 22:46.032
because you broke into his home.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.000
I needed his records.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.436
I didn't kill him!

22:51.804 --> 22:52.872
I needed him.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.709
Help me make the case
with the IRS.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.050
Hey.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.184
Hey.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.086
- Charlie's not here.
- I know.

23:07.119 --> 23:11.123
He's in his office running
another statistical analysis

23:11.157 --> 23:12.892
on his serial killer data.

23:12.925 --> 23:13.560
Mm.

23:13.593 --> 23:14.661
He can be pretty obsessive.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.596
You can never get through to him
when he's like this.

23:16.629 --> 23:19.031
The only way is to find a flaw
in his analysis,

23:19.065 --> 23:21.200
you know, prove he's not
following a valid line.

23:21.233 --> 23:25.171
I went over his work
looking for errors.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.105
I think there's

23:26.138 --> 23:28.007
a good reason for Charlie
to be obsessed.

23:28.040 --> 23:31.043
All right, why don't you
walk me through it then?

23:36.483 --> 23:39.486
DAVID: Mark Horn threatened Gene
Evans, broke into his home.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.153
We can place him in the vicinity
of the murder.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.855
Can you link him
to any of the other deaths?

23:42.889 --> 23:44.924
No, he was out
of the country for one cluster,

23:44.957 --> 23:46.759
in another state
for another one.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.595
DON: I just looked at those

23:48.628 --> 23:50.463
interrogation tapes.
There's no way that's the guy.

23:50.497 --> 23:51.564
Based on what?

23:51.598 --> 23:52.499
Based on the fact

23:52.532 --> 23:54.767
that he was arrested
for harassing Evans.

23:54.801 --> 23:55.868
I mean, if he's
gonna kill him,

23:55.902 --> 23:57.169
he's knows were gonna come
after him.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.739
Right, but Horn didn't try
to leave the area

23:59.772 --> 24:01.574
or conceal his whereabouts.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.242
Well, Amita showed me this work
she's doing on your timeline,

24:03.275 --> 24:05.011
and it answered
some questions.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.245
You say he's careful.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.781
He plans his attacks.
He scouts his victims.

24:08.815 --> 24:11.017
So why kill Evans
withoutthe usual interval?

24:11.050 --> 24:12.251
For the same reason
he kills this guy:

24:12.284 --> 24:15.221
'cause he's careful.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.188
NIKKI:
The killer didn't know

24:16.222 --> 24:17.590
that this postal carrier would

24:17.624 --> 24:19.258
be running three hours late.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.160
Which means that the mailman saw

24:21.193 --> 24:23.530
the killer
at the house of the last murder.

24:23.563 --> 24:26.866
Okay, so he kills the mailman
as a witness, but why Evans?

24:26.899 --> 24:30.236
Why? Because two days before
he dies, he goes online,

24:30.269 --> 24:33.272
said he's gonna start up
with his detective work again.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.907
And the killer decided
to stop him.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.809
So the micro-clusters happen

24:36.843 --> 24:39.846
when the killer covers
his tracks.

24:39.879 --> 24:42.281
We don't have hard evidence.
It's all circumstantial.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.282
And statistics.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.519
And the pattern,
which indicates another attack

24:46.553 --> 24:47.820
within the next 48 hours.

24:47.854 --> 24:50.823
I say we move now.
Look, I'll take responsibility.

24:50.857 --> 24:54.193
Okay, you all heard the man
on desk duty.

24:54.226 --> 24:55.161
Let's get to it.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.305
The one important
constant,

25:06.338 --> 25:08.875
his careful stalking
of his potential victims,

25:08.908 --> 25:10.276
sometimes for weeks.

25:10.309 --> 25:11.644
DAVID: There are often police
reports

25:11.678 --> 25:13.312
of prowlers
and peeping Toms

25:13.345 --> 25:14.313
prior to the killings.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.815
And yet you say he's careful?

25:15.848 --> 25:17.316
I think he likes
to spook his victims,

25:17.349 --> 25:18.918
let them catch glimpses of him.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.219
And even if they call
the police...

25:20.252 --> 25:22.221
Prowler reports aren't taken
as serious threats.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.023
COLBY: Well, if he's
gonna kill again,

25:24.056 --> 25:25.825
then maybe there'll be new
prowler reports

25:25.858 --> 25:27.193
and attempted break-ins.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.929
In L.A. alone, there'd have
to be hundreds a week.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.063
CHARLIE:
The most likely target

25:31.097 --> 25:32.999
is a couple in their mid-30s

25:33.032 --> 25:36.168
within an area of elevated
geographic probabilities.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.170
Single-family residence,
no locked gates,

25:38.204 --> 25:39.371
no alarm systems.

25:39.405 --> 25:43.075
A place to conceal a vehicle,
access to a major roadway.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.010
That gives us
a starting point.

25:48.981 --> 25:52.218
In your analysis, you, uh,
you left out Victim Zero.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.286
Well, that's because I don't
think that there's enough

25:54.320 --> 25:56.255
to link Nancy Kershaw
to the clusters.

25:56.288 --> 26:00.793
See, I would have to
agree with Roy here.

26:00.827 --> 26:02.762
I share his interest
in this Victim Zero.

26:02.795 --> 26:03.763
See?

26:03.796 --> 26:05.665
You see that?
Physics guy

26:05.698 --> 26:06.899
thinks there's something
to my idea.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.300
Well, now just consider,
Charles,

26:08.334 --> 26:10.369
you don't include Nancy Kershaw

26:10.402 --> 26:12.939
because she doesn't seem
to fit your pattern.

26:12.972 --> 26:16.042
But is that really a reason
to exclude data?

26:16.075 --> 26:18.310
Do you think her death
tells us something?

26:18.344 --> 26:20.880
Well, you know when we look
at the light from distant stars,

26:20.913 --> 26:24.817
we look at the past, millions,
maybe billions of years.

26:24.851 --> 26:27.286
That's how long it took
that light to reach the Earth.

26:27.319 --> 26:30.623
And yet, the undisputed
1862 UFO sighting

26:30.657 --> 26:32.224
during the Battle
of Vicksburg

26:32.258 --> 26:34.293
proves that extraterrestrials

26:34.326 --> 26:36.095
have mastered
superluminal velocity.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.630
But just returning
to the point here...

26:37.664 --> 26:38.530
Yes.

26:38.564 --> 26:40.132
If Nancy Kershaw is
the first victim,

26:40.166 --> 26:43.069
that tells us things about
the killer that he was

26:43.102 --> 26:46.706
very careful to hide
in subsequent crimes.

26:46.739 --> 26:49.642
She was in his orbit,
so to speak.

26:49.676 --> 26:50.910
Right, right. And remember,

26:50.943 --> 26:53.412
if our guy did kill her,
then he's the same guy

26:53.445 --> 26:55.181
who called up her boyfriend
and threatened to kill him, too.

26:55.214 --> 26:57.950
(whispers): So somebody out
there has heard his voice.

26:57.984 --> 27:02.088
All right, find out what you can
from the conspiracy community,

27:02.121 --> 27:04.090
and I'll get the FBI on it.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.727
Thank you,
astrology dude.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.296
Astronomy.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.231
Astronomy.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.033
Thanks.

27:14.066 --> 27:17.369
You remember what Gene Evans
told Charlie?

27:17.403 --> 27:19.005
That he shared
his research

27:19.038 --> 27:21.440
on serial killers
with a detective in Bakersfield?

27:21.473 --> 27:22.775
Yeah?

27:22.809 --> 27:24.143
Name's Brent Driscoll,
and guess what.

27:24.176 --> 27:25.745
He died last year.

27:25.778 --> 27:27.313
How?

27:27.346 --> 27:28.981
They said he fell, hit his head,

27:29.015 --> 27:30.750
and wound up drowned
in his backyard pool.

27:30.783 --> 27:31.784
Yeah.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.853
Doesn't that seem just a bit
suspicious to you?

27:33.886 --> 27:35.287
- Bakersfield PD look into it?
- Well, sure.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.956
But they didn't know
there was a killer

27:36.989 --> 27:38.457
who eliminates investigators
and witnesses.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.325
We need Driscoll's files.

27:39.358 --> 27:40.426
I'm driving up tomorrow.

27:43.429 --> 27:44.964
CHARLIE:
What do you have there?

27:44.997 --> 27:46.966
It's a home improvement project

27:46.999 --> 27:49.001
I hope you both
will help me out with.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.036
I told you I would.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.038
All right. So, front
and backyard landscaping.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.072
Take a look.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.406
You're asking him about it?

27:54.440 --> 27:57.043
What about me?
I own this house.

27:57.076 --> 27:59.746
Oh, yeah, like you care
what hedges he puts out there.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.147
Point made.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.181
(chuckles)

28:03.783 --> 28:04.483
How you doing there?

28:04.516 --> 28:05.718
(sighs)

28:05.752 --> 28:07.186
David's got half
the office trying

28:07.219 --> 28:09.989
to ID potential victims
by running

28:10.022 --> 28:11.958
down prowler reports.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.993
Hey, you guys remember
the first time, huh?

28:14.026 --> 28:14.927
That first serial case?

28:14.961 --> 28:16.963
Remember? It was right here in
this room.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.330
You figured it out
together.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.832
Remember?

28:19.866 --> 28:22.301
It was like a lifetime ago.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.036
Five years.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.938
Yeah, it was right before that
you had grown so far apart

28:25.972 --> 28:27.774
that I was the only thing
you had in common.

28:27.807 --> 28:30.009
I figured after I died,
you might spend years

28:30.042 --> 28:32.812
not seeing each other,
but, um, to tell you the truth,

28:32.845 --> 28:34.013
I'm not worried
about that anymore.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.221
(door opens)

28:42.254 --> 28:44.256
Hey, Charlie,
you got something new?

28:44.290 --> 28:46.959
No, I've got
something old.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.127
I was talking with Don

28:48.160 --> 28:50.496
and my dad about a previous
serial case we worked on,

28:50.529 --> 28:52.031
and it reminded me of this.

28:54.333 --> 28:57.303
So I analyzed these three
clusters, and it gave me

28:57.336 --> 28:59.171
these three
probable locations

28:59.205 --> 29:00.907
for the killer.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.074
(computer trilling)

29:02.108 --> 29:04.043
That's the Hot Zone equation.

29:04.076 --> 29:04.610
The very same.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.512
Now how does this work?

29:06.545 --> 29:08.180
Well, think of it like a...

29:08.214 --> 29:10.449
Can, uh, can I do this?

29:13.019 --> 29:14.286
It's like a lawn sprinkler

29:14.320 --> 29:16.022
spreading hundreds
of drops of water.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.858
Now, it's impossible to predict
where the next drop will fall,

29:18.891 --> 29:21.127
but if you take away the
sprinkler, from the pattern

29:21.160 --> 29:24.196
of the drops you could calculate
its location.

29:24.230 --> 29:27.233
You're saying that we can find
out where the killer lives?

29:27.266 --> 29:30.102
Yeah. We know that he's either
lived in

29:30.136 --> 29:33.005
or is linked to
these three areas.

29:33.039 --> 29:34.206
DAVID: You run a
comparative analysis

29:34.240 --> 29:36.108
against the prowler reports
we got?

29:36.142 --> 29:38.344
Oh, I love it
when a student grasps

29:38.377 --> 29:40.112
the full potential
of an application.

29:40.146 --> 29:42.414
(typing)
Top 30 potential victims,

29:42.448 --> 29:44.483
ID'd from police reports,
geographic areas,

29:44.516 --> 29:46.418
victim profiles.

29:46.452 --> 29:49.021
The numbers represent the
probability of their being

29:49.055 --> 29:50.056
the next victim.

29:50.089 --> 29:52.391
The best we can get is 23%?

29:52.424 --> 29:54.260
In the world of statistical
analysis, 23% means...

29:54.293 --> 29:54.927
Uh, can I do this one?

29:56.328 --> 29:57.997
It means get your ass in gear.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.103
Come on, guys.
Dinner's ready.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.371
COLBY: So, he tends
to attack couples,

30:05.404 --> 30:06.572
right?

30:06.605 --> 30:08.240
And also teenagers.

30:08.274 --> 30:11.543
Some with their parents asleep
in the same house.

30:11.577 --> 30:14.246
We got people
at the 30 residences

30:14.280 --> 30:16.148
that Charlie thinks are
the most likely targets.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.984
Yeah, maybe
we'll get lucky,

30:18.017 --> 30:19.018
so to speak.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.136
COLBY:
Hey, what's that movie

30:37.169 --> 30:38.070
with Al Pacino--
he's a cop,

30:38.104 --> 30:40.072
and he ends up sleeping
with Ellen Barkin,

30:40.106 --> 30:41.908
and then it turns out that her
ex-husband was the killer?

30:41.941 --> 30:42.909
Sea of Love.

30:42.942 --> 30:44.911
No, that wasn't it.

30:44.944 --> 30:47.546
Yeah, it is.
Seen it, like, five times.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.251
You a big Pacino fan?

30:52.284 --> 30:53.752
No. Michael Rooker fan.

30:58.024 --> 31:00.960
He was Henry in Henry: Portrait
of a Serial Killer.

31:00.993 --> 31:02.028
Oh, yeah, that guy.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.896
That guy's always the killer.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.231
No, he's not. You ever seen
The Replacement Killers?

31:05.264 --> 31:07.233
He was the cop.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.869
Hey, look there.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.060
FBI.

31:34.093 --> 31:35.494
- Get down!
- On your knees!

31:35.527 --> 31:38.164
Okay, don't shoot me!

31:42.168 --> 31:43.235
What the hell's going on?

31:43.269 --> 31:44.136
We're FBI.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.073
Leonard, is that you?

31:47.106 --> 31:47.673
You know him?

31:47.706 --> 31:48.240
MAN:
Leonard Philber.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.176
Friend of my daughter's.

31:51.443 --> 31:52.578
(crashing)

31:56.148 --> 31:57.283
What the hell are
you doing here?

31:57.316 --> 31:59.218
I was just gonna TP
a tree, man!

32:02.254 --> 32:03.289
DAVID:
FBI!

32:03.322 --> 32:04.957
(screams)
(gunshot)

32:04.991 --> 32:06.658
(screaming)

32:35.654 --> 32:38.490
Kill your light.
Kill your light.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.392
Did you see him?

32:40.426 --> 32:41.460
No.

32:50.436 --> 32:53.405
DAVID: He had a car hidden
nearby. He ditched it.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.707
Continued on foot
or had a second car somewhere.

32:55.741 --> 32:58.010
He had an escape route
planned out in advance.

32:58.044 --> 32:59.211
He knew exactly
where he was going.

32:59.245 --> 33:00.379
Everyone all right?

33:00.412 --> 33:02.548
Everyone's fine.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.516
All right. I'll get back to you.

33:04.550 --> 33:07.253
Well, it was the right place,
buddy, but he's gone.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.588
Damn it. He plans ahead.
He knew how to get away.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.423
Listen, I'm worried
that we've presented ourselves

33:11.457 --> 33:12.524
with an even bigger
problem here.

33:12.558 --> 33:13.792
- What do you mean?
- This guy's moved three times.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.562
Now that he was almost caught,
he's going to relocate again.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.099
So, the killer started

33:20.132 --> 33:21.733
in Northern California,
moved south,

33:21.767 --> 33:22.668
and now he's here in L.A.

33:22.701 --> 33:25.237
Like three points
of gravitational force,

33:25.271 --> 33:28.174
the killer residing
somewhere in them, unseen,

33:28.207 --> 33:31.443
exerting his destructive
influence like a black hole.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.412
Yeah. We need to narrow
each hot zone down

33:33.445 --> 33:35.647
and profile all the men in them
and look for a common link.

33:35.681 --> 33:36.882
That's a lot of legwork.

33:36.915 --> 33:39.351
All right. I'll get census lists
and Social Security records.

33:39.385 --> 33:40.619
We can start cross-checking.

33:46.492 --> 33:47.693
I found something
in the Driscoll files.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.695
Now, Driscoll's the detective
who worked with Gene Evans,

33:49.728 --> 33:51.797
and he supposedly drowned
in a pool last year.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.266
He interviewed a man
as a suspect

33:54.300 --> 33:55.501
in a murder in Bakersfield.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.770
Robert Posdner--
the guy who claimed he saw

33:58.804 --> 33:59.605
Gene Evans' killer.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.373
He was a witness
in the murder here.

34:01.407 --> 34:04.476
He was also a suspect
in a Bakersfield murder.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.712
Even I have to ask.
What are the odds?

34:06.745 --> 34:09.648
And Bakersfield files ID him
as Wayne Potvin.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.450
He's one of 19 suspects

34:11.483 --> 34:13.185
in the murder
of a married couple.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.187
Now, Driscoll questioned him,
did a background check.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.355
He came up clean.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.424
- It was a fake ID.
- COLBY: All right.

34:18.457 --> 34:20.692
We got more.
We ID'd about 250 men

34:20.726 --> 34:22.794
with ties to three
geographic areas.

34:22.828 --> 34:25.831
Ran their DMV photos
through facial recognition.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.199
Got four hits.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.235
Thomas Park,
David Palmer,

34:29.268 --> 34:31.637
Wayne Potvin,
and Robert Posdner.

34:31.670 --> 34:32.771
It's the same guy.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.440
- We got our killer.
- We still can't

34:34.473 --> 34:36.208
tie him through hard evidence
to even one murder.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.676
Well, we can at least get him
for faking his identity.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.145
That's not enough.

34:39.178 --> 34:41.447
We need to put this guy away
for serial murder.

34:42.781 --> 34:43.582
What's next?

34:43.615 --> 34:45.184
You tell me, boss.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.186
Right, okay. Um... We-We
put him under surveillance

34:47.219 --> 34:49.821
and we try to see if we can get
enough for a search warrant.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.323
Sounds good.

34:58.630 --> 34:59.665
MAN (over radio):
Follow Two to Follow One.

34:59.698 --> 35:02.201
The Eagle has landed.

35:03.869 --> 35:07.239
Follow One to Follow Two.
You've been made.

35:07.273 --> 35:08.307
Don't burn the target.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.641
Copy, Follow One. Breaking away.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.446
CHARLIE: It's just weird
knowing who the killer is

35:14.480 --> 35:16.182
and not being able to prove it.

35:16.215 --> 35:19.218
Yeah. It's not unlike that
period between forming a theory

35:19.251 --> 35:21.220
and then finding the proof
that supports it.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.322
Well, most theories don't
relocate, switch identities,

35:23.355 --> 35:24.856
and resume killing people.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.293
No, not that we know of.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.228
You realize, Charlie,
at some point,

35:29.261 --> 35:31.530
you're going to have
to focus on work here.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.432
You need help
with your particle analysis?

35:33.465 --> 35:35.267
No, no, no.
I'm not talking about me.

35:35.301 --> 35:36.335
I'm talking about you.
Your potential.

35:36.368 --> 35:38.337
Solving crimes
is important,

35:38.370 --> 35:40.639
but discovering the hidden
mathematical structures

35:40.672 --> 35:43.209
within brain operations...

35:43.242 --> 35:45.244
Guys! I got something.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.179
(wheezing and panting)

35:47.213 --> 35:48.380
- You all right?
- Uh-huh.

35:48.414 --> 35:49.881
Yeah, I'm good.

35:49.915 --> 35:53.385
My heart hurts, but I just ran
from the parking lot.

35:53.419 --> 35:55.354
What's that, like, 200 feet?

35:55.387 --> 35:56.222
Here's the thing.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.956
So, I was looking
at the whole, uh,

35:57.989 --> 36:00.526
Victim Zero case, right?
The high school girl?

36:00.559 --> 36:02.694
There was a fellow student
who was expelled

36:02.728 --> 36:04.363
from the same school
the year before.

36:04.396 --> 36:05.231
He was a suspect.

36:05.264 --> 36:07.433
- Thomas Park.
- CHARLIE: Thomas Park?

36:07.466 --> 36:09.835
That's one of the identities
the FBI suspect used.

36:09.868 --> 36:12.471
Bingo! This is so Zodiac.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.240
Frickin' awesome.

36:14.273 --> 36:16.308
Look at this. I got goose bumps.

36:16.342 --> 36:18.877
And it continues
down my spine.

36:18.910 --> 36:22.214
Thomas Park was 18 at the time
of Nancy Kershaw's murder.

36:22.248 --> 36:24.950
They knew each other
and it says here that

36:24.983 --> 36:27.319
he was a suspect
because he kept asking her out

36:27.353 --> 36:29.588
- and hanging around her house.
- Stalking her.

36:29.621 --> 36:32.324
Nancy Kershaw's boyfriend,
Steve Savard...

36:32.358 --> 36:33.425
now, he got to the house

36:33.459 --> 36:35.227
when the killer was still there.
He chased him away.

36:35.261 --> 36:36.628
Now, one week later,

36:36.662 --> 36:38.364
he was nearly killed
in a car accident.

36:38.397 --> 36:39.398
Someone cut the brake line.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.666
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.601
Couple of days after, uh,
Kershaw's murder,

36:42.634 --> 36:44.836
uh, her boyfriend received
a threatening phone call

36:44.870 --> 36:46.805
from somebody claiming
to be the killer.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.340
Steve Savard heard
the killer's voice.

36:48.374 --> 36:49.775
All right.
Do we know where he is now?

36:49.808 --> 36:51.643
Well, after the murder,
his family got scared.

36:51.677 --> 36:52.811
They moved
from Stockton to Nevada.

36:52.844 --> 36:53.979
Is he still
out of state?

36:54.012 --> 36:55.514
'Cause we need to find him
right now.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.283
Uh, I did.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.017
I used some of my contacts
to track him down.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.420
His flight should have
landed an hour ago.

37:01.453 --> 37:02.754
- Are you kidding me?
- Huh?

37:02.788 --> 37:04.790
- Are you kidding me?
- He's a little angry.

37:04.823 --> 37:05.791
You know, I just figured

37:05.824 --> 37:07.393
time was sensitive, right?

37:07.426 --> 37:08.727
So, I took the liberty of, uh...

37:08.760 --> 37:10.329
Of impersonating an FBI agent?

37:10.362 --> 37:12.431
I didn't tell anyone I was...

37:12.464 --> 37:14.966
I can't help what people assume.

37:16.602 --> 37:20.539
I went to work that day,
like any other day.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.841
COMPUTER (higher pitch):
I went to work that day,

37:22.874 --> 37:23.842
like any other day.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.677
Amita's designed an algorithm
that captures

37:25.711 --> 37:27.913
Robert Posdner's voice
from his Bakersfield interview.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.582
Ah. When he was interviewed
as a possible suspect?

37:30.616 --> 37:32.718
Yes, and she's mathematically
reconstructed it

37:32.751 --> 37:33.952
to have the same tone and timbre

37:33.985 --> 37:36.555
as his voice might have had
at age 18.

37:36.588 --> 37:39.525
We have some recordings
we want you to listen to, okay?

37:41.327 --> 37:42.828
Amita, we're ready.

37:44.062 --> 37:45.897
COMPUTER (higher pitch):
I went to work that day,

37:45.931 --> 37:47.399
like any other day.

37:47.433 --> 37:49.335
(beeps)

37:49.368 --> 37:51.637
COMPUTER (slightly deeper):
I went to work that day,

37:51.670 --> 37:51.937
like any other day.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.639
(beeps)

37:53.672 --> 37:55.474
COMPUTER (deeper, rougher):
I went to work that day,

37:55.507 --> 37:57.476
- like any other day.
- That one.

37:57.509 --> 37:58.610
There's, uh, one more.
(beeps)

37:58.644 --> 38:00.879
COMPUTER (higher, more nasal):
I went to work that day,

38:00.912 --> 38:02.147
like any other day.

38:02.180 --> 38:04.983
No. No, not that one-- the one
before it. That was the closest.

38:05.016 --> 38:08.320
Closest? Or the same guy that
threatened you 20 years ago?

38:08.354 --> 38:09.888
SAVARD: Well, you-you
altered it, right?

38:09.921 --> 38:10.856
'Cause now he's an adult.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.391
You tried to make it
sound like a teenager.

38:12.424 --> 38:13.825
Uh...

38:13.859 --> 38:16.294
Can I hear the recording
the way it is?

38:17.863 --> 38:19.398
Amita, play #3 straight.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.804
POSDNER (on recording):
I went to work that day,

38:25.837 --> 38:26.505
like any other day.

38:26.538 --> 38:27.973
(beeps)

38:29.441 --> 38:30.075
That's him.

38:32.411 --> 38:33.879
He said he killed

38:33.912 --> 38:35.080
Nancy...

38:35.113 --> 38:36.081
(voice breaks)

38:36.114 --> 38:37.683
...and he was going to kill me.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.385
You're sure?

38:39.418 --> 38:41.820
He murdered the girl I loved.

38:43.422 --> 38:46.057
Nearly killed me.

38:46.091 --> 38:48.660
My family moved
to another state.

38:51.563 --> 38:54.366
Everything changed.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.469
There's not a week
that goes by

38:57.503 --> 39:00.639
I don't wake up
from a dead sleep

39:00.672 --> 39:02.107
and hear that voice.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.646
Yeah... I'm sure.

39:16.422 --> 39:20.926
(car doors open and close)

39:20.959 --> 39:22.828
Robert Posdner.
FBI.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.162
Let me see your hands.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.698
It's Agent Sinclair, right?

39:27.799 --> 39:30.402
Robert? What's happening?

39:30.436 --> 39:31.570
- Ma'am.
- It's okay, honey.

39:31.603 --> 39:34.440
They're federal agents.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.441
Look at her.

39:35.474 --> 39:39.445
Poor thing has no idea.
It'll be a total shock.

39:42.113 --> 39:45.684
Honey, it's almost time to
pick up the kids, isn't it?

39:53.058 --> 39:54.860
Nobody knew about me.

39:55.994 --> 39:56.628
I liked it that way.

39:58.597 --> 39:59.831
Some serial killers, you know,

39:59.865 --> 40:01.500
they-they write
to the newspapers

40:01.533 --> 40:03.469
or they taunt the police.

40:03.502 --> 40:06.104
I never drew attention
to myself.

40:06.137 --> 40:09.941
I just wanted to go about
the things I needed to do.

40:11.076 --> 40:14.613
You know, most
serial killers...

40:17.082 --> 40:18.917
...they can't
control themselves.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.186
They're too damaged.

40:21.219 --> 40:24.490
They aren't careful.

40:24.523 --> 40:27.626
You need to plan,
if you're doing it right.

40:32.631 --> 40:34.232
You know, people who know me,

40:34.265 --> 40:37.469
they'll all say they never
suspected anything.

40:41.006 --> 40:42.040
Well, I made sure they didn't.

40:45.611 --> 40:47.679
That's my favorite part.

41:04.530 --> 41:08.133
Took you guys a long, long time
to find me, didn't it?

41:22.013 --> 41:25.283
I know there are reasons,
psychological motivations

41:25.316 --> 41:29.120
for why sociopaths
become serial killers.

41:29.154 --> 41:32.023
But this guy...

41:32.057 --> 41:35.026
He just seems evil.

41:35.060 --> 41:38.730
You really weren't expecting a
rational explanation, were you?

41:38.764 --> 41:40.065
I mean, with these guys,
you know,

41:40.098 --> 41:42.233
no matter how smart and focused
they appear to be,

41:42.267 --> 41:44.670
it always comes down
to an irrational rage.

41:44.703 --> 41:46.838
DAVID: And in the end, it's
rationality that caught him.

41:46.872 --> 41:48.740
Rationality and logic.

41:48.774 --> 41:50.742
That and a little obsession.

41:51.877 --> 41:52.944
LIZ:
Your brother gets

41:52.978 --> 41:55.714
stabbed, and you react
by catching a serial killer.

41:55.747 --> 41:58.083
You got a hell of a way
of working through things.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.685
Some people drink.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.620
Some gamble.

42:01.653 --> 42:02.721
I analyze data.

42:02.754 --> 42:05.691
(laughing)

42:07.826 --> 42:10.061
*

42:10.095 --> 42:13.198
So Charlie, how about tomorrow,
we unpack your office

42:13.231 --> 42:15.634
and get you set up
in your new, prestigious space?

42:15.667 --> 42:17.168
Yes, and locate
several books of mine

42:17.202 --> 42:18.670
I think got left
in your stuff.

42:18.704 --> 42:20.972
All right. I'm ready.

42:21.006 --> 42:22.140
ALAN: What about
you, Donnie?

42:22.173 --> 42:23.341
Hmm? You gonna be hanging
out with

42:23.374 --> 42:24.910
me for the next couple of weeks?

42:24.943 --> 42:26.578
Sorry, pal.
I'm back to full duty Monday.

42:26.612 --> 42:28.346
Ooh, there's a quick recovery.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.649
ALAN:
So, why don't you try to put

42:30.682 --> 42:31.449
some time
between injuries, huh?

42:31.482 --> 42:33.251
Trust me.
I plan to take it easy.

42:33.284 --> 42:34.085
Yeah, right.

42:35.854 --> 42:36.855
(sprinklers whirring,
Amita screams)

42:36.888 --> 42:37.856
Whoa!

42:37.889 --> 42:39.324
ALAN: They're supposed
to come on much later.

42:39.357 --> 42:41.960
LARRY:
Hey! This is a vintage linen!

42:41.993 --> 42:44.062
(shouting)

42:45.764 --> 42:49.701
* Counting numbered days...
