WEBVTT

00:10.135 --> 00:12.103
That hurt.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.061
You okay?
I don't know yet.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.944
I don't think
anything's broken.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.111
I think I'm okay, too.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.200
We in some kind
of a cave?

00:29.279 --> 00:30.531
I have no idea.

00:32.658 --> 00:33.659
Dude...

00:36.787 --> 00:38.414
It's a catacomb.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.378
This must be a church.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.334
Not just any church.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.260
This is the church
from the map!

00:47.297 --> 00:48.970
Oh, my God.

00:49.132 --> 00:52.102
Whatever they hid, they have
to have hidden it down here.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.345
Or they must have
buried it.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.644
Start with the floor. Look
for some kind of opening.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.441
Get the shovels.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.565
Sir. Sir.
He's bleeding.

01:01.645 --> 01:02.737
Back away.
Medic!

01:06.483 --> 01:08.201
Out of the way.
Out of the way.

01:10.696 --> 01:12.039
I got him. Balcony.

01:12.656 --> 01:14.124
Andy, Andy.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.451
Come on.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.919
Open the door.

01:19.121 --> 01:22.216
Hey, secure the building. Block access.
Nobody in or out.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.338
Get officers
on the street.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.394
Come on.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.020
Sir, sir.

01:40.309 --> 01:41.435
Give him space.

01:41.518 --> 01:42.770
Get them out of here.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.195
Where are the medics?

01:55.907 --> 01:57.124
Clear.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.292
Dead.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.836
All clear.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.880
We need space.
Move away!

02:12.716 --> 02:14.764
He's got to be in the building.
We couldn't have missed him.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.083
Unless he went out
that balcony.

02:16.928 --> 02:19.522
Or the roof. Call that in.
I'll check it out.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.147
Need a bus.
Apartment 1212, Plaza.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.012
Oh, God. Get the medics.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.594
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.262
Put pressure. Look at me.
Look at me.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.400
Hey, hey. Look up, look up!
You'll be fine.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.308
You got him?

03:49.813 --> 03:51.781
I got nothing.
Neither do I.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.155
Burying something
under these stones?

03:54.234 --> 03:56.154
I mean, that's kind of
overkill, don't you think?

03:56.194 --> 03:58.617
I mean, we are
in the catacombs

03:58.697 --> 04:00.857
of an ancient church in the
middle of the Black Forest.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.039
You really think the Crusaders
would have made it that difficult

04:03.118 --> 04:05.120
if they ever wanted to come
back for this thing someday?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.417
Well, we have to check,
because they might have,

04:06.496 --> 04:07.748
and we're not
coming back.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.031
But think about it,
archeology,

04:09.082 --> 04:11.835
anthropology, as we know it,
didn't exist back then.

04:11.918 --> 04:16.014
History wasn't something you studied.
It was something you made.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.716
Usually with
a lot of blood.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.103
I’m just
saying, I think...

04:22.596 --> 04:25.770
I think we need
to think like them.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.227
Okay.

04:28.310 --> 04:32.110
So, 800 years ago,

04:33.064 --> 04:34.361
people were
very superstitious.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.409
They wouldn't have
liked being down here.

04:36.693 --> 04:37.740
Right?

04:37.819 --> 04:39.196
So, maybe

04:40.197 --> 04:42.120
putting something behind
a bunch of dead people

04:42.199 --> 04:44.293
would give it a little more
security than just, you know,

04:44.367 --> 04:46.711
burying it under
any old stones.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.126
Protected by the
spirits of the dead.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.087
Exactly.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.047
Skull and crossbones.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.973
Crossbones
make an

04:59.049 --> 05:00.346
I'll start
with this one.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.138
Nothing personal, guys.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.356
Or gals.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.872
I'll call you when
the cinchona arrives?

05:14.356 --> 05:16.905
Uh-huh. Okay,
you're welcome.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.031
I should go
check on Kelly.

05:19.110 --> 05:22.740
Look, you don't have to do any more.
You've done plenty today.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.944
Don't you think we should
have heard from 'em by now?

05:25.075 --> 05:26.292
Yeah.

05:26.618 --> 05:27.790
Maybe.

05:28.703 --> 05:29.983
I'm trying not
to think about it.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.151
Maybe they're out
of cell service.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.005
Yeah, that's one of the
things I keep telling myself.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.257
I'll try to come up
with a few more for you.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.098
Okay, yep, coming!

05:46.596 --> 05:48.018
Maybe this is wrong, too.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.520
No, we're not done yet.

05:53.770 --> 05:54.942
Oh!

05:55.146 --> 05:56.693
Sorry, buddy.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.992
Better now than when you
were alive, though, right?

06:12.914 --> 06:14.040
Wow!

06:20.797 --> 06:22.557
I don't think there's
anything else up there.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.558
There's something
we're not seeing.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.139
Just like the maps
on the keys.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.086
The "X" was right
in front of us,

06:31.099 --> 06:33.318
but we couldn't see it until we
started thinking differently.

06:33.393 --> 06:37.114
Well, I'm thinking all these
bones look the same to me.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.565
No, it's got to be
down here somewhere.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.822
What if we're looking
too hard, you know?

06:42.152 --> 06:44.496
I mean, I don't see
an Nick.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.157
We need to go back
800 years.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.913
We kind of are
back 800 years.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.290
I don't think a lot has changed
down here in that time.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.669
I'm not talking about the place.
I'm talking about us.

06:54.748 --> 06:58.093
It's like you said. We're not
thinking the way they are.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.181
Nobody would come down
here without light, right?

07:07.344 --> 07:09.392
Not if they wanted
to see anything, no.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.145
And they would've been too
scared by the spirits, right?

07:13.600 --> 07:17.446
Yeah, and in a world
lit only by fire,

07:18.188 --> 07:20.691
they would have had, like,
you know, torches.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.367
So, what if light

07:27.280 --> 07:29.703
actually prevents
someone from seeing it?

07:31.368 --> 07:32.870
Wait a minute.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.957
If nobody would ever come
down here without torchlight,

07:37.040 --> 07:39.338
but what they hid can't
be seen with torchlight,

07:39.417 --> 07:43.968
then, yeah, I mean, fear alone would
have kept anybody from doing that.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.149
So, maybe we should
turn off the lights.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.305
Uh...

07:51.721 --> 07:53.723
Yeah, I mean,
I guess...

07:54.265 --> 07:55.391
Guess we could do that.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.978
Okay, dark.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.606
Well, it's not an
What's not an "X?"

08:00.689 --> 08:02.316
I can't tell what
you're looking at.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.867
Oh, my God,
that better be your hand.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.865
Look at those skulls.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.909
Seven of 'em.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.914
Kind of a circle.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.372
Don't look like a circle.
Looks more like a

08:16.454 --> 08:17.546
Oh, my God.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.966
For the seven
Grimm Crusaders.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.258
Holy crap.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.922
They're all facing in,
not out.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.221
What do you think those
seven are looking at?

08:30.885 --> 08:32.261
Let's find out.

08:56.870 --> 08:57.917
There's the

09:11.176 --> 09:12.268
It's done.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.678
Any complications?

09:13.762 --> 09:15.810
No. Send the car.
On its way.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.398
Make sure the driver
has my documents.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.820
He does.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.669
Marwan.
Can you hear me?

09:41.956 --> 09:43.378
Call 911.
I'll see if he's okay.

09:47.045 --> 09:50.299
Marwan. What happened?

10:09.484 --> 10:11.282
This is a seriously
old shield.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.075
I doubt they would have
just hidden a shield.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.701
It's probably
protecting something.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.211
Holy crap.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.421
Check it out.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.891
Careful, careful, careful.
It could fall apart.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.567
Those“.
I think it's bronze.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.319
Those look like keyholes.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.197
Four on this side,
three on the other.

10:51.442 --> 10:55.163
Seven locks, seven keys.
Let's give it a try.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.574
Oh, man.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.386
Not boding well.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.643
I got one.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.236
Oh, my God, Nick.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.866
Dude, this is it.
I mean, this is really it.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.030
We're touching history!

11:37.113 --> 11:40.583
I mean, this thing hasn't been
seen for, like, 800 years.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.410
I mean, I just... I think
we should take a moment

11:42.493 --> 11:44.621
and just, you know,

11:44.704 --> 11:46.627
recognize
the significance of this.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.712
Well, it's not open yet.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.965
I know, I know, but this is
momentous, even if it's empty.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.468
I mean,
we came this far!

11:54.547 --> 11:55.764
We found it!

11:55.840 --> 11:59.310
After all the others have searched
throughout the centuries!

12:01.638 --> 12:02.730
I know. I know.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.604
I mean, we should see if it
opens, but I'm just saying.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.901
We're gonna need the other
two keys or lock-picks.

12:13.983 --> 12:18.113
I forgot my lock-picks. I
should have brought my lock-picks.

12:18.196 --> 12:19.869
I mean, we can't take it
to a locksmith here.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.788
How do we explain what it is
or how we found it

12:21.824 --> 12:22.950
or any of it?

12:23.034 --> 12:24.911
We're gonna have to
take it to Portland.

12:25.954 --> 12:29.234
All right, well, the first thing we got to
do is figure out how to get out of here.

12:32.335 --> 12:35.885
I mean, we certainly can't climb
back up the way we fell in.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.433
Well, there's got
to be an entrance.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.761
All right,
I'll take this one.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.469
Hey, I think
I found the way out!

13:37.567 --> 13:38.864
This has to be it.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.296
I can't believe it.
It's horrible.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.463
Well, I have to go.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.041
- You take care.
- You, too.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.714
What happened?

13:55.793 --> 13:58.672
Somebody killed
Andrew Dixon.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.053
The guy running for mayor? Yes.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.635
He was shot at a rally
just a couple of hours ago.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.936
Oh, my God.
Did they get who did it?

14:06.095 --> 14:08.415
I don't know.
A customer just told me.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.225
She didn't know
anything more than that.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.403
Can I help you?

14:14.479 --> 14:15.776
Tony?

14:18.441 --> 14:19.721
Why didn't you
answer my letters?

14:19.984 --> 14:21.611
I know you got 'em. I checked
the address outside.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.866
I sent 'em here.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.869
Look, Tony, I have moved on with my
life, and I don't think we need...

14:25.948 --> 14:27.245
I need your help.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.624
The kind of help you need,
I... I can't give you.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.823
What's that
supposed to mean?

14:32.538 --> 14:33.698
I don't want
to get into this.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.542
You owe me.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.881
I don't owe you
anything.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.052
I went to jail for you.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.488
You didn't go to jail
for me, Tony.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.674
I robbed those people
'cause you were crashing.

14:42.757 --> 14:45.681
You robbed those people so you
and Carlos could get high!

14:45.760 --> 14:48.388
Well, Carlos is dead now.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.599
J.J.'s in Boise,
and Burt's in jail.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.308
I got no one left
to turn to.

14:53.476 --> 14:54.819
I need five grand.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.906
You can come up with five grand.
I mean, look at this place.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.358
Probably make that
in a day.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.823
You need to leave now.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.914
So you get your
little ass straight.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.291
Think you're better
than everyone.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.003
You know me, Rosie.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.002
And you should know better
than to piss me off!

15:24.173 --> 15:25.550
Get out!

15:25.675 --> 15:27.518
You owe me, bitch!

15:28.594 --> 15:30.141
Stop it!
Leave her alone.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.641
How much money
you got?

15:35.101 --> 15:36.227
I'm calling
the police.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.607
The hell you are.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.955
Still want
to call the cops?

15:48.030 --> 15:49.532
Tony, no!

15:53.661 --> 15:56.335
Oh, God!

16:15.099 --> 16:17.318
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.197
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.401
Oh, my God.
It can't be back.

16:25.485 --> 16:29.115
Oh, my God, it can't be back, it
can't be back. I don't want it back.

16:29.197 --> 16:32.667
Maybe... Maybe it's
just temporary.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.746
No, no, no, I can't have it back.
I never want it back.

16:36.829 --> 16:40.504
Don't... Please, you...
You can't tell Nick.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.677
Please, please promise me
that you won't tell him.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.846
He'll get rid of us.
Please, you can't tell him.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.218
I won't tell him,

16:46.297 --> 16:48.846
But you can't keep it from him if it...
If it happens again.

16:48.925 --> 16:52.020
It would be so much worse if he
found out and you hadn't told him.

16:52.637 --> 16:54.560
I can't go back
to being that.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.016
You are so different now.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.227
Maybe it would be different
even if it came back.

16:59.727 --> 17:03.152
You don't understand what it's
like being a Hexenbiest...

17:03.231 --> 17:07.281
What it does to you, the way
it makes you think and feel.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.406
It's not good.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.115
Maybe we can find a way
to boost the suppressant.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.474
We're out.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.941
All right,
hand me the stuff.

17:46.857 --> 17:48.530
All right, got it.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.660
Let's go.
Okay.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.212
That's a lot of light.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.421
Coming this way.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.723
Well, maybe somebody's lost and
it's a search party looking for...

18:13.175 --> 18:14.677
We should go.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.617
Was that the priest?

18:30.693 --> 18:31.945
Yeah, I think so.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.076
What the hell is the
priest doing out here?

18:34.155 --> 18:35.623
You think he knows
about the keys?

18:35.698 --> 18:38.451
No, I think the guy we scared in
the church made me as a Grimm.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.376
Oh, my God,
you're right.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.628
He obviously
told the priest.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.050
They're hunting us.

19:07.438 --> 19:08.815
He's calling for them
to go to him.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.178
He must have found
the catacombs.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.360
That ought to keep
'em busy for a while.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.964
Little bastard.
He bit me!

19:29.043 --> 19:31.671
No! Hey, no.
We don't have time. Go.

19:31.837 --> 19:32.838
Man!

19:48.354 --> 19:49.355
Did you get him?

19:49.438 --> 19:51.281
No. Somehow,
we missed him.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.076
Every room in that building has
been checked top to bottom.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.446
So we get nothing? No, we know who it is.
It's Marwan.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.655
Wait, you saw him?

19:57.738 --> 19:59.285
No, but it's him.
Then how do you know?

19:59.365 --> 20:01.993
Trubel confirmed he was in Portland,
and he was reported in the area.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.670
He must have attacked the cop that
made him. It was definitely Wesen.

20:04.745 --> 20:05.837
No, this doesn't make
any sense.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.837
Why would he kill a candidate
running for mayor of Portland?

20:08.916 --> 20:10.876
He's Black Claw. His targets
are bigger than this.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.465
Unless Dixon was Wesen.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.296
Was he?

20:15.589 --> 20:16.806
No, I don't think so.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.186
Feds are here.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.814
They're gonna be
all over this.

20:23.889 --> 20:24.981
What do we tell 'em?

20:25.057 --> 20:27.901
Can't ID Marwan, 'cause we
can't explain our source.

20:27.977 --> 20:29.604
Run them through it.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.317
Tell them you saw
a shooter in the window.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.820
Let them run their own
investigation, and stay out of it.

20:48.289 --> 20:49.290
Hey...

20:50.458 --> 20:52.631
Our car
is right in the middle.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.110
How are we supposed to get down
there without them seeing us?

20:58.674 --> 21:00.051
Call them.
Tell them you're here.

21:01.719 --> 21:02.936
What?

21:03.596 --> 21:04.813
In German.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.812
But they don't know me.

21:08.476 --> 21:11.025
What if you did it
while you were Woged?

21:11.103 --> 21:12.605
All Blutbaden do
not look alike.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.861
I know, but it's dark.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.860
And if they're looking
for a Grimm,

21:16.942 --> 21:18.285
the last place
they'd expect to find one

21:18.360 --> 21:20.408
is with a Blutbad in the
middle of the Black Forest.

21:20.488 --> 21:21.990
That's true.

21:23.032 --> 21:24.204
You have any better ideas?

21:24.617 --> 21:26.119
No, I guess I don't.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.979
Come on. Come on.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.356
It's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.316
Well, we can't outrun
all of them.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.696
They're not gonna know
which way we went.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.028
Well, then,
they're gonna split up.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.750
We're gonna have to
deal with some of 'em.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.116
One tire, each car.

22:05.199 --> 22:06.542
Shovels.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.035
They're coming.

23:20.316 --> 23:21.989
It's Marwan Hanano's.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.114
How'd you get it?

23:23.193 --> 23:24.753
He dropped it when
he was hit by a bike.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.415
Does he know you have it?

23:28.490 --> 23:30.584
No. He won't be awake
for a while.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.454
The names and numbers on it will
fill in a lot of blanks for us.

23:33.579 --> 23:36.128
Where is he? Paramedics took
him to Overton Medical.

23:36.498 --> 23:37.938
We have to get
the phone back to him.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.010
He mustn't suspect
it was out of his control.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.264
When he wakes up,
he'll call somebody.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.967
That could lead us to the Black
Claw cell that set this up.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.098
Make a copy of the SIM
card, put it back in.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.225
Make sure the phone and card
are clean of prints.

23:50.304 --> 23:52.227
And we'll see where the
son of a bitch takes us.

23:58.062 --> 23:59.609
I don't see 'em.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.565
We're going straight
to the airport.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.026
Damn it.

24:04.026 --> 24:05.026
Is your arm okay?

24:05.069 --> 24:08.448
That little creep-wad got me good, but
we're not gonna stop to deal with it.

24:08.530 --> 24:09.952
Just keep going.

24:48.946 --> 24:52.325
We should be getting home. You don't
have to stay with us tonight.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.828
His name is Tony.

24:55.911 --> 24:59.381
He was part of a group I used to
crash with for a while in Seattle.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.003
Sort of a low point
in my life.

25:01.917 --> 25:04.136
No money,
bad relationship.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.005
Experimenting with

25:07.256 --> 25:08.678
too many things.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.930
I wish I could just bury
that entire part of my life.

25:12.594 --> 25:15.768
You ever do anything like that when
you were young that you regret?

25:16.515 --> 25:20.019
Not really. I was kind
of a nerd student.

25:20.102 --> 25:22.855
I guess I wanted to prove to my
mother that I was nothing like her,

25:22.938 --> 25:24.815
so I became a lawyer.

25:25.441 --> 25:26.488
Oh.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.570
How you feeling?

25:29.653 --> 25:30.654
About the same.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.704
I haven't found
anything that could help.

25:34.783 --> 25:38.538
You won't. Dead Hexenbiest
isn't easy to come by.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.087
I'm sorry.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.093
- Spice & Tea...
- Rosalee, it's me.

25:49.173 --> 25:50.470
Monroe?

25:51.550 --> 25:52.642
Where are you?

25:52.718 --> 25:55.267
We're in a taxi in Stuttgart.
We're on our way to the airport.

25:55.345 --> 25:57.393
We're due in to Portland
at 9:50 tomorrow morning.

25:57.473 --> 25:58.645
Did you find anything?

25:58.724 --> 26:01.352
I probably shouldn't talk
about it on the phone.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.395
Don't say a word
to anyone,

26:03.479 --> 26:05.106
but let's just say
it wasn't for nothing.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.732
Is Adalind there?
Is Adalind there?

26:06.815 --> 26:08.032
She is.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.944
Nick wants
to talk to her.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.495
It's Nick.

26:13.322 --> 26:14.369
Nick?

26:14.448 --> 26:15.825
How are you and Kelly?

26:17.659 --> 26:19.457
We're good. How are you?

26:19.995 --> 26:21.247
We are...

26:23.499 --> 26:24.671
Coming home.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.627
Anyway, I just wanted you
to know that we're okay,

26:27.669 --> 26:28.841
and I'll see you soon.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.173
Safe flight.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.761
Monroe?
Love you.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.265
I love you.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.943
Portland mayoral
candidate Andrew Dixon was shot

26:47.022 --> 26:50.947
at a political rally at Lovejoy
Fountain Park this afternoon.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.575
The gunman or
gunmen have not been apprehended,

26:53.654 --> 26:56.248
and no suspects
have been identified.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.250
Dixon was leading in the...

26:58.325 --> 26:59.542
Yeah.
It's me.

27:02.538 --> 27:03.585
He's making a call.

27:03.664 --> 27:05.424
We've been trying to find you.
Where are you?

27:05.541 --> 27:07.043
In the hospital.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.799
What happened?
 I don't know.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.550
I got hit by a bicycle.
Get here.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.132
It's all over the news,
but there are no suspects.

27:13.507 --> 27:14.679
They've got nothing.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.305
Pick me up now.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.058
Track his phone.
He'll lead us to them.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.457
...Overton Medical Center.

27:19.847 --> 27:22.225
I'll be there
in 20 minutes.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.536
Anything? No, still
pulling surveillance.

27:34.611 --> 27:37.411
Anything within a square mile of the
building where the shot was fired.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.912
We have checked a lot so far.
Nothing yet.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.285
No, this guy's too good.

27:41.535 --> 27:43.128
He knew where every
surveillance camera was

27:43.203 --> 27:44.170
and picked his
route accordingly.

27:44.246 --> 27:45.338
Now, we need to find out

27:45.414 --> 27:46.961
when the information on the
rally was made available

27:47.040 --> 27:49.280
and if there was any connection to Dixon.

27:49.877 --> 27:50.877
Renard.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.842
I know
who shot Andrew Dixon.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.321
Caller says he knows
who shot Dixon.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.229
Who is this?

28:00.304 --> 28:02.477
The man you're
looking for is at Overton Medical.

28:02.556 --> 28:04.058
He may not be
there much longer.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.648
What... He's in the hospital?
How'd that happen?

28:08.687 --> 28:10.155
Is this a crank?

28:10.230 --> 28:11.277
Can't take that chance.

28:11.356 --> 28:12.448
We could
surround the hospital.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.492
No, if we go in big,
he'll see us coming.

28:14.568 --> 28:16.070
Then what do you want?

28:16.153 --> 28:17.325
Just us.

28:22.326 --> 28:24.454
He's exiting the front
entrance of the hospital.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.255
Now he's stopped.

28:27.331 --> 28:29.208
Waiting to be picked up.

28:40.469 --> 28:41.971
Moving again.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.059
Moving back
to the hospital.

28:47.392 --> 28:48.609
What's he doing?

29:26.306 --> 29:28.525
Moving pretty fast.
He's in a car.

29:29.351 --> 29:30.477
He's running.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.368
From who? From whoever
came to pick him up.

29:42.364 --> 29:43.991
No, something else
is going on.

30:09.683 --> 30:12.562
He's fighting. Whoever was
after him must've caught him.

30:12.644 --> 30:13.987
Now, who's
screwing this up?

30:37.586 --> 30:39.680
He's not moving.
He could be dead.

30:39.755 --> 30:40.802
All this for nothing.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.133
We still have
his contacts.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.642
And once they've realized
he's been compromised,

30:44.718 --> 30:46.140
they're going
to change it all.

30:46.595 --> 30:47.812
Tell me if he moves.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.772
Call it in.
Yes, sir.

30:57.147 --> 30:58.694
I need all
available units...

30:58.774 --> 31:00.117
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.868
His hair wasn't blond.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.411
He dyed it.

31:03.487 --> 31:04.909
Yeah, but I don't think
I would've recognized him

31:04.988 --> 31:06.490
if he hadn't run.

31:06.573 --> 31:07.699
That's him.

31:07.783 --> 31:09.376
Yeah, but how did the
person who called you

31:09.451 --> 31:12.125
and told you he was in the
hospital know it was him?

31:12.204 --> 31:15.299
The picture we put out,
he didn't look like that.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.961
Now, this whole thing has
to be some kind of setup.

31:29.346 --> 31:32.475
Yeah?
Marwan's cell is moving.

31:33.350 --> 31:34.476
To where?

31:34.559 --> 31:35.981
Renard's police precinct.

31:41.858 --> 31:45.408
...desire to see your neighbors
as well as yourselves thrive.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.794
Folks, Portland is
a great place.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.894
Portland is
a great place.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.209
You screwed it up.

32:35.620 --> 32:36.792
What are you
talking about?

32:36.872 --> 32:40.593
We put him in the hospital for a reason.
We needed his contacts.

32:40.667 --> 32:43.307
The accident that put him in the
hospital, that wasn't an accident.

32:44.171 --> 32:47.550
We had his phone, we had every contact,
every call, everyone he was working with.

32:47.632 --> 32:50.476
You knew what he did.
We needed him alive.

32:50.552 --> 32:51.672
Then you should have
told me.

32:51.720 --> 32:52.937
We didn't know you
were going to kill him.

32:53.013 --> 32:54.310
You're the one
who told me about him.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.982
How did you even know
he was at a hospital?

32:56.057 --> 32:57.479
We got a tip.
From whom?

32:57.559 --> 32:59.106
Who could give you
that kind of tip?

32:59.186 --> 33:00.779
You were set up.
By who?

33:00.854 --> 33:02.822
The people who brought
him here, Black Claw.

33:03.106 --> 33:04.107
You destroyed
months of work.

33:04.191 --> 33:05.591
Then you should
have said something!

33:06.818 --> 33:09.992
This was bad
for all of us.

33:22.709 --> 33:24.006
Sean.

33:26.963 --> 33:28.761
I thought about calling.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.934
I really need you tonight.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.450
I think it's time we
play a little rougher.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.459
You knew Dixon
was gonna get shot.

33:59.454 --> 34:01.206
Who the hell are
you working for?

34:07.254 --> 34:09.097
The people who are
gonna change your life.

34:44.748 --> 34:47.628
Lucien.
Sean Renard.

34:49.838 --> 34:51.181
Nice place.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.342
You want to tell me
what's going on?

34:53.425 --> 34:55.393
Dixon was meant to die,

34:56.136 --> 34:58.605
and you were meant to kill
the man that killed him.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.920
You were the one that told me
Marwan was in the hospital.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.109
And you're
a Zauberbiest.

35:03.184 --> 35:04.356
Which makes you
one of us.

35:06.187 --> 35:08.815
We could make you the most
powerful man in the city.

35:10.150 --> 35:11.868
And that's only
the beginning.

35:13.570 --> 35:14.696
You're Black Claw.

35:15.530 --> 35:16.747
Show him.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.000
You got to be kidding.

35:27.083 --> 35:30.053
You're a hero.
You can win.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.737
I'm so glad
you're back.

35:56.404 --> 35:57.747
Me, too.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.081
Ow.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.034
What happened?
I got bitten.

36:01.076 --> 36:03.396
We'll deal with it. We'll deal
with it later. Hey, Rosalee.

36:04.079 --> 36:05.199
Let's get everyone
over here.

36:09.250 --> 36:12.754
This does not look good. I think
it's infected. How does it feel?

36:12.921 --> 36:14.264
It hurts.

36:14.339 --> 36:17.013
You could have blood poisoning. I
think we should get you to a doctor.

36:17.092 --> 36:18.389
Yeah, yeah,
definitely.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.475
Got it.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.109
Get your keys.

36:32.649 --> 36:36.620
I hope whatever's in here is
worth it for everyone who died.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.289
Ready?

36:52.252 --> 36:53.253
Now.

37:21.197 --> 37:23.825
It's not opening.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.912
What do you mean, it's not opening?
The keys all clicked.

37:26.995 --> 37:28.497
It's got to take
more than the keys.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.924
Why? Why does it have to take more
than the keys? They're just locks.

37:30.999 --> 37:33.172
If they lock, they should open.
That's what locks do.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.091
There's some stuff between
the lid and the box.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.844
Looks like some
kind of sealant.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.641
What kind of sealant
holds for 800 years?

37:41.634 --> 37:43.102
Well, they were
all Grimms.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.726
Look, I'm just
spitballing here,

37:45.805 --> 37:48.183
but your blood did take away
Adalind's powers, right?

37:49.142 --> 37:51.486
So maybe,
I don't know...

37:52.228 --> 37:53.354
Will you get me
a knife?

37:53.438 --> 37:54.690
It sort of
makes sense.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.986
If this doesn't work, I'm busting
out the freaking hacksaw.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.193
Oh, my God.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.749
Okay, there better
be something inside that.

38:49.118 --> 38:51.212
Okay. There is.

39:18.439 --> 39:19.816
It's a stick?

39:20.733 --> 39:21.780
Looks like a stick.

39:22.151 --> 39:23.368
A really old stick.

39:23.444 --> 39:24.866
It can't be just a stick.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.619
Well, that's what
it looks like.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.247
They wouldn't
have buried a stick

39:30.076 --> 39:31.794
unless they were
some kind of dog Wesen.

39:31.870 --> 39:35.625
Maybe it's some kind of important
stick that belongs to a bigger

39:35.707 --> 39:38.677
piece of wood that means
something to somebody.

39:39.294 --> 39:42.218
Well, if it was a stick-mata...
Sorry, that was a reach.

39:42.297 --> 39:45.392
Maybe it's something like a stick from
the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.594
You're talking about the tree
that Eve picked the apple from

39:47.677 --> 39:49.099
in the Garden of Eden?

39:49.178 --> 39:52.398
If that's the case, then we just
flew halfway across the world

39:52.473 --> 39:55.898
and risked our lives for a stick
that has screwed up all of humanity

39:55.977 --> 39:57.097
since the beginning of time.

39:57.103 --> 39:58.821
Maybe that's why they
buried it in the first place,

39:58.897 --> 40:02.697
'cause the gates of hell are gonna open up,
and the world as we know it is gonna end.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.575
On that thought, maybe
you should put it back.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.622
The last thing we want are the gates
of hell opening up in Portland.

40:07.697 --> 40:09.620
Seems like
they already have.

40:09.699 --> 40:14.330
Okay, now let's get you to a doctor and get
your arm looked at before it falls off.

40:17.707 --> 40:21.007
Ho, ho, ho. There's some
writing on this cloth.

40:28.176 --> 40:30.725
I have no idea what language this is.
Do you?

40:34.432 --> 40:35.684
Monroe?
What's wrong?

40:36.559 --> 40:37.651
Huh?

40:38.770 --> 40:40.192
I, uh...

40:41.981 --> 40:43.358
I don't, uh...

40:44.025 --> 40:45.026
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey!

40:45.193 --> 40:46.445
Okay.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.951
He's passing out.
Come on. Get him down.

40:49.030 --> 40:50.498
Must be his arm.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.246
Hey, buddy.
All right?

40:52.367 --> 40:53.607
Oh, my God.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.412
Oh, I knew it.
It's blood poisoning.

40:56.704 --> 40:58.047
Quick, we need
a tourniquet, somebody.

40:58.122 --> 41:00.420
Put it on his arm before any more
infection gets to his heart.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.923
We can use my belt.
Here.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.299
Call 911.

41:04.379 --> 41:05.631
I think he's going
into shock.

41:05.713 --> 41:08.637
We need an ambulance. Got a
medical emergency.

41:09.842 --> 41:10.934
All right. Now what?

41:11.010 --> 41:13.104
We can't wait for an ambulance.
We have to get him to a hospital.

41:13.179 --> 41:14.931
Get him up. Let's get him up, come on.
Come on!

41:15.014 --> 41:17.483
Okay. Ho! Ho! Okay.

41:18.059 --> 41:19.436
Wait, wait.
Nick, we can't wait!

41:19.519 --> 41:21.237
Look at his arm.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.023
What's happening?

41:29.237 --> 41:30.409
I don't know.

41:33.741 --> 41:35.163
It's getting better.

41:35.243 --> 41:36.495
What?

41:41.749 --> 41:44.093
Anyone want to take a
stab at explaining that?

41:45.253 --> 41:46.470
Not me.

41:46.546 --> 41:48.298
I've never seen
anything like that.

41:54.429 --> 41:55.931
What did you do?

42:01.310 --> 42:02.812
What happened?

42:07.358 --> 42:08.575
This.
