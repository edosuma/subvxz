WEBVTT

00:07.270 --> 00:09.659
More on point than a sock.

00:19.580 --> 00:20.217
Coffee?

00:20.250 --> 00:22.389
I wasn't sure how you take it.

00:22.420 --> 00:24.513
Black is fine, thank you.

00:24.550 --> 00:25.517
I'm Joan.

00:25.550 --> 00:27.757
Tatiana.

00:27.790 --> 00:29.655
Please, don't interpret
the to-go cup

00:29.690 --> 00:31.578
as a sign that you need
to rush off

00:31.630 --> 00:33.427
no matter what
Sherlock tells you.

00:33.460 --> 00:35.519
I'll have you know, Watson,
that Tatiana is rushing off

00:35.560 --> 00:37.164
of her own accord.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.498
It's her morning
to deliver the sermon.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.667
Thank you for
the coffee.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.463
And you, for
last night.

00:43.510 --> 00:44.704
I'll let myself out.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.379
Mmm.

00:47.410 --> 00:48.672
Sermon?

00:48.710 --> 00:51.838
She's a pastor of some sort.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.576
And her last name is?

00:54.620 --> 00:56.588
Probably quite lovely.

00:56.620 --> 00:59.487
So, yesterday was
the archaeologist.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.249
And last week was

01:01.290 --> 01:04.487
the schoolteacher
and the magICIan?

01:04.530 --> 01:06.589
Mortician,
Sylvia is a mortician.

01:06.630 --> 01:09.428
The magician left on tour
about a month ago.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.234
I have to say, Watson,
I'm feeling a little bit judged.

01:12.270 --> 01:14.591
Y_ou're well aware that I
View sex as an exercnse.

01:14.640 --> 01:15.664
As do the women I entertain.

01:17.370 --> 01:18.462
No judgment.

01:18.510 --> 01:21.479
Just buy some
more to-go cups.

01:32.290 --> 01:33.484
(knocking)

01:33.520 --> 01:35.613
WOMAN:
Ms. Lanzer?

01:35.660 --> 01:37.582
Uh, Vincent is ready to start

01:37.630 --> 01:39.655
the rehearsal if you are.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.691
Good morning, Ms. Lanzer.

01:46.770 --> 01:49.364
Prima is on the move.

01:56.410 --> 01:58.503
Everybody, settle!

01:58.550 --> 02:00.575
Places, please.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.871
_ MAN:
All right, places.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.410
First cue.

02:03.450 --> 02:05.680
*

02:25.240 --> 02:27.208
Columns go.

02:27.240 --> 02:28.776
MAN (over radio):
Columns go.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.242
(loud crash nearby)

02:38.290 --> 02:39.712
What was that?

02:39.760 --> 02:42.558
MAN:
Lights! Lights!

02:42.590 --> 02:44.729
WOMAN:
What is that?

02:44.760 --> 02:47.228
(women screaming)

02:47.260 --> 02:49.524
(gasping)

03:30.610 --> 03:32.237
either ballet is ascendant
in the zeitgeist,

03:32.280 --> 03:34.601
or it's leaked
that a murder has occurred here.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.575
Half the company tweeted
their regrets for the deceased

03:37.610 --> 03:39.316
before we even got here.

03:39.350 --> 03:41.614
A couple of them even mentioned
that she was...

03:41.650 --> 03:43.311
cut in two.

03:43.350 --> 03:44.647
She was one of the dancers?

03:44.690 --> 03:46.487
Her name was Nell Solange.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.909
We noticed a few security
cameras on the way in.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.928
Apparently,
so did the killer.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.258
All the cameras
in and around the theater

03:53.300 --> 03:55.894
feed into one hard drive
In the manager's office.

03:55.930 --> 03:57.989
Unfortunately for us,

03:58.030 --> 03:59.736
the perp took it on his way out.

03:59.770 --> 04:00.964
Vincent Renatto.

04:01.000 --> 04:01.967
He's the company's
ballet master.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.501
Mr. Renatto?

04:03.540 --> 04:04.962
I'd like you to meet
our consultants,

04:05.010 --> 04:05.999
Mr. Sherlock Holmes

04:06.040 --> 04:08.975
and Ms. Joan Watson.
Our condolences for your loss.

04:09.010 --> 04:09.999
Thank you.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.972
I adored Nell, I...

04:12.010 --> 04:13.716
We're all reeling.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.342
I choreographed this piece
with her in mind.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.688
She was dancing the lead?

04:16.720 --> 04:18.847
Unfortunately,
during auditions,

04:18.890 --> 04:20.517
she never quite connected
with the role.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.357
Didn't give it
her full focus.

04:22.390 --> 04:24.858
So I had to cast a more
established dancer.

04:35.070 --> 04:37.265
Bisection.

04:39.740 --> 04:42.971
_ It's been a while
smce I've seen one of these.

04:43.010 --> 04:45.069
You'd think there'd
be more blood.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.873
You would.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.014
If being cut in half
was what had killed her.

04:52.090 --> 04:54.513
Her throat was slit.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.983
Preliminary time of death
was around 10:00 last night.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.520
We think she was
killed backstage,

04:58.560 --> 05:00.027
and then moved up
into the rigging.

05:00.060 --> 05:02.369
Perp coiled a wire

05:02.400 --> 05:05.096
around her waist,
so that in the morning,

05:05.130 --> 05:08.361
when the backdrop came down,
the wire would tighten,

05:08.400 --> 05:09.537
and...

05:09.570 --> 05:10.867
The killer wanted drama.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.537
Attention.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.798
Spectacle.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.444
Yeah, but the kill itself

05:16.480 --> 05:18.471
was pretty simple--
a single slice

05:18.510 --> 05:20.444
to the carotid artery
with a thin, sharp blade.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.017
The wound is shallow,
so the blade was probably small.

05:23.050 --> 05:24.381
Like a box cutter?

05:25.050 --> 05:26.711
Follow me.

05:29.690 --> 05:30.952
Marcus!

05:30.990 --> 05:32.890
I didn't realize
you were off desk duty.

05:32.930 --> 05:35.990
Yeah, Captain pulled some
strings with the commissioner.

05:36.030 --> 05:38.021
Still no gun, so I'm not
allowed to fly solo.

05:38.070 --> 05:39.537
But it's a start.

05:39.570 --> 05:40.935
We're pretty sure
this is the spot

05:40.970 --> 05:42.562
where Ms. Solange was killed.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.009
CSU found some blood drops.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.474
Sprayed the area with luminol,
and the whole floor lit up.

05:46.510 --> 05:47.738
Now, after she was dead,

05:47.780 --> 05:49.645
the killer wiped up her blood
with some towels,

05:49.680 --> 05:51.545
hid them in the bottom
of that trashcan.

05:51.580 --> 05:54.811
I found this wrapped
in one of them.

05:54.850 --> 05:56.579
(grunts)

05:56.620 --> 05:58.611
Well, we may well have
our murder weapon.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.015
CSU already looked it
over for prints.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.857
They won't know for sure
till they get it back

06:01.890 --> 06:04.484
to the lab, but they think
it's been wiped clean.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.781
See that design etched
on the handle?

06:05.830 --> 06:07.821
It's a flower.

06:07.860 --> 06:09.498
That's not just a flower.

06:09.530 --> 06:12.693
That is an iris.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.968
I can't believe it.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.467
I was looking
everywhere for it.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.865
I figured one

06:16.910 --> 06:19.572
of the core_ dancers must have
taken It as a souvenir.

06:19.610 --> 06:20.702
Souvenk?

06:20.740 --> 06:21.934
It's happened before.

06:21.980 --> 06:23.948
They take things
to remember me by.

06:23.980 --> 06:25.379
Or to show their friends.

06:27.780 --> 06:30.943
Please forgive my colleagues,
Ms. Lanzer.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.878
They don't follow the ballet.
They don't know that meeting

06:32.920 --> 06:35.388
Iris Lanzer means they are
in the presence of a master.

06:36.690 --> 06:38.726
Hmm.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.125
I myself had
the pleasure of seeing

06:40.160 --> 06:41.718
your Jeu de Cartes in London.

06:41.760 --> 06:42.988
It was inspired.

06:43.030 --> 06:44.725
Thank you.

06:44.770 --> 06:45.964
BELL:
Ms. Lanzer,
I have to ask.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.537
Why do you have a
personalized box cutter?

06:48.570 --> 06:50.208
HOLMES:
Every ballerina
has their own set

06:50.240 --> 06:51.798
of tools for preparing
their shoes

06:51.840 --> 06:53.137
to their own specifications.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.136
Box cutters are used
for trimming the soles.

06:55.180 --> 06:56.442
GREGSON:
When was the last time

06:56.480 --> 06:57.879
you saw your box cutter?

06:57.910 --> 06:59.673
Last week.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.779
I've been using a spare
ever since.

07:01.820 --> 07:04.914
Would you say that you
and Neil were rivals?
No, not at all.

07:04.950 --> 07:07.089
Nell was unformed as a dancer.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.883
Vince Renatto didn't seem
to think so.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.684
He told us that he wanted her
to dance the lead in this piece.

07:11.730 --> 07:15.518
He flirted with the notion
of Neil, but he chose me.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.892
We will need to know
your whereabouts last nIght.

07:17.930 --> 07:19.989
Do you think I...

07:21.270 --> 07:22.703
I left the theater
at 7:00.

07:22.740 --> 07:24.708
I went home.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.628
I was there all night.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.875
My housekeeper's a live-in.
She can vouch for me.

07:28.910 --> 07:30.548
Can you think
of anyone else

07:30.580 --> 07:32.969
who may have meant
Ms. Solange harm?

07:33.020 --> 07:34.840
I heard a rumor
that she broke up

07:34.880 --> 07:36.074
with her boyfriend,
Nicholas Orman.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.940
He used to be a dancer
with the company.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.241
I seem to recall
he had a temper.

07:39.290 --> 07:40.917
Thank you very much, Ms. Lanzer.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.621
We shall speak with him.

07:42.660 --> 07:44.958
And, again, a great honor
to meet you.

07:44.990 --> 07:46.548
GREGSON:
Come on. Marcus,

07:46.600 --> 07:48.852
you take McAndrews and pay
a visit to the ex-boyfriend.

07:48.900 --> 07:52.688
I'll put Ellis and Parker on
confirming Ms. Lanzer's alibi,

07:52.740 --> 07:54.628
all right? Okay.
MAN_:
Captain.

07:54.670 --> 07:56.035
Would you consider
a little company, Detective?

07:56.070 --> 07:57.867
The more, the merrier.

07:57.910 --> 08:01.209
Wait here.
I got to find McAndrews.

08:01.240 --> 08:04.869
You know you went a little, uh,
fanboy back there, right?

08:04.910 --> 08:06.719
"Fanboy"?
I don't think

08:06.750 --> 08:08.843
I've ever seen you treat
a suspect so politely.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.245
I don't believe
she IS a suspect.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.087
Explain that.

08:12.120 --> 08:14.611
You suggested she has motive
to kill Ms. Solange

08:14.660 --> 08:16.082
because she felt threatened,

08:16.120 --> 08:18.953
but_I don't believe a talent
as Immense as Ms. Lanzer

08:18.990 --> 08:21.026
is capable of viewing
another dancer as a threat.

08:21.060 --> 08:23.096
It would be like me
wanting to kill the world's

08:23.130 --> 08:25.621
second greatest detective.
Besides, she has an alibi.

08:25.670 --> 08:26.489
According to her.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.098
Iris Lanzer may be
an amazing dancer,

08:28.140 --> 08:31.007
but the Internet says
she's not a very nice person.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.270
She has a lousy reputation,
and last year,

08:33.310 --> 08:35.699
she ended up in court
for pushing down a photographer

08:35.740 --> 08:38.140
and smashing his camera.
Damning evidence,

08:38.180 --> 08:40.819
indeed, if the charge was
that she was a diva.

08:40.850 --> 08:43.546
She is. That doesn't make her
a murderer.

08:43.590 --> 08:44.989
(phone rings)

08:45.020 --> 08:48.183
Excuse me. Hey, Bill.

08:48.220 --> 08:50.256
What hospital is he in?

08:52.160 --> 08:54.151
Okay, yeah. I'll be there
as soon as I can.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.224
Problem?

08:55.260 --> 08:56.329
Haven for the Homeless,

08:56.360 --> 08:58.328
that charity
that I work for, um...

08:58.370 --> 09:00.736
one of the clients
went off his meds

09:00.770 --> 09:03.568
and got into some altercation
with a couple of cops.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.602
Go. I shall endeavor to keep
my fandom in check without you.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.629
MAN:
I.D. says his name

09:07.680 --> 09:09.079
is Morris Gilroy.

09:09.110 --> 09:10.805
He was standing
outside a bodega

09:10.850 --> 09:12.738
screaming at anyone
who walked by.

09:12.780 --> 09:15.578
Said he was looking
for his pal, "Freebo."

09:15.620 --> 09:17.884
We asked him to move along,
but he only got more worked up.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.286
And then finally he
took a swing at me,

09:20.320 --> 09:22.356
and then we had
to wrestle him down.

09:22.390 --> 09:25.587
He said his arm was hurt,
so we brought him here.

09:25.630 --> 09:27.325
Well, Mr. Gilroy
is in the system

09:27.360 --> 09:28.759
with the Department
of Homeless Services.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.290
I mean, he's schizophrenic

09:30.330 --> 09:32.662
but with no history
of aggression or violence.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.634
Oh, lucky me.
He made an exception.

09:34.670 --> 09:37.104
Well, obviously,
he's off his meds.
Yeah, you think?

09:37.140 --> 09:40.632
You said he was looking
for someone named "Freebo"?

09:40.680 --> 09:43.069
His pink elephant,
ifI had to guess.
I told you,

09:43.110 --> 09:45.146
he's not drunk. He's...
A nutbar. Yeah,
we got that.

09:45.180 --> 09:48.069
Freebo's gone.
The sergeant.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.644
They took him.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.942
They hit him
and they took him.

09:51.990 --> 09:55.380
Were you able to get any more
information about this Freebo?

09:55.420 --> 09:57.627
Uh, Ms. Watson,

09:57.660 --> 09:59.321
I already told you we're
not gonna collar him.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.191
But that's a
profeSSIonal courtesy.

10:01.230 --> 10:02.868
If you're thinking we're
gonna go out looking

10:02.900 --> 10:04.094
for his imaginary
friend...

10:04.130 --> 10:06.098
They took him!
Do you hear me?!

10:06.130 --> 10:09.258
They took Freebo!

10:09.300 --> 10:11.962
Morris, I'm Joan. I know you're
worried about your friend.

10:12.010 --> 10:13.204
They took him,

10:13.240 --> 10:14.275
and I got to find him.

10:14.310 --> 10:15.402
Who took him?

10:15.440 --> 10:17.874
Who? Morris,
(straining)

10:17.910 --> 10:20.640
I want to help you, but
you need to calm down.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.410
Okay, I need you
to calm down.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.645
Okay?

10:25.690 --> 10:27.419
You'll find him?

10:27.460 --> 10:30.020
You'll find Freebo?

10:30.060 --> 10:31.857
I will do my best.

10:31.890 --> 10:34.688
I promise.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.293
BELL:
Where exactly do you work,
Mr. Orman?

10:39.330 --> 10:42.128
I'm a dancer
at, uh, Jerzey Boyz.

10:42.170 --> 10:44.138
It's a club
over In Newark.

10:44.170 --> 10:46.707
When I quit ballet,
I needed the money.

10:46.740 --> 10:48.207
Especially after Nell moved out.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.969
She ended the relationship?

10:50.010 --> 10:51.705
She said she needed some space.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.139
What a crock.
She took up with another guy.

10:54.180 --> 10:56.045
Why do you say that?

10:56.080 --> 10:57.843
She was preoccupied.

10:57.890 --> 11:00.256
Always busy, always running off.

11:00.290 --> 11:01.848
She wouldn't tell me
the guy's name,

11:01.890 --> 11:03.926
no matter how many times
I asked.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.827
Eventually, she, uh, threatened
me with a restraining order.

11:06.860 --> 11:08.919
Said that she'd
talked to a lavwer.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.360
Hard to imagine how
she resisted your charms.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.436
You know what I think?

11:13.470 --> 11:15.358
I think that maybe this new
guy's the one that killed her.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.936
Maybe she, uh,
cheated on him, too.

11:16.970 --> 11:18.335
HOLMES:
Another possibility:

11:18.370 --> 11:20.099
You never got over her rejection

11:20.140 --> 11:21.402
and you murdered her.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.705
Nell was killed
last night, right?

11:24.750 --> 11:27.014
Last night, I worked.

11:27.050 --> 11:31.817
I was a big hit with
the generous ladies of Newark.

11:31.850 --> 11:33.488
Some of these bills have
phone numbers on them.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.489
Feel free to call
'em up and check.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.852
Nicholas Orman has
a rock-solid alibi.

11:38.890 --> 11:40.323
His manager confirmed
he was at work

11:40.360 --> 11:42.089
from 8:30
to midnight.

11:42.130 --> 11:44.098
GREGSON:
Then he's doing better
than Iris Lanzer.

11:44.130 --> 11:46.189
It turns out she_lied
to us this morning.

11:46.230 --> 11:48.369
Her housekeeper
was off last night.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.961
She's on her way to the station,
with her lawyer.

11:52.010 --> 11:53.477
MAN:
We have been over this.

11:53.510 --> 11:54.932
My client made
an honest mistake.

11:54.980 --> 11:57.278
Her housekeeper recently
changed her night off,

11:57.310 --> 11:59.141
and Ms. Lanzer
simply forgot.

11:59.180 --> 12:01.375
I went right to my room
when I got home.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.081
I turned in
shortly thereafter.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.509
Do you usually go
to bed that early?

12:05.550 --> 12:07.256
Before a dress rehearsal, yes.

12:07.290 --> 12:08.518
I need to be at my best.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.778
IfI was gonna kill Nell,

12:10.830 --> 12:12.058
I would've done it
on another night.

12:12.090 --> 12:14.194
Of course,
my client is joking.

12:14.230 --> 12:17.427
HOLMES:
Ms. Lanzer, do you know
the name of the man that Neil

12:17.470 --> 12:19.938
started seeing after she
broke up with Nicholas Orman?

12:19.970 --> 12:21.858
I've reached out to several
members of the company.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.765
No one seems _to know
who he IS.

12:24.540 --> 12:27.509
Nell and I weren't close...

12:27.540 --> 12:29.531
but to the best of my knowledge,

12:29.580 --> 12:31.377
she wasn't seeing anyone.

12:31.410 --> 12:33.310
And if Nicholas
told you otherwise,

12:33.350 --> 12:34.817
he's probably trying
to deflect suspicion.

12:34.850 --> 12:36.249
GREGSON:
Uh, Mr. Orman

12:36.280 --> 12:37.986
has an alibi
for the time of the murder,

12:38.020 --> 12:39.510
unlike you.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.280
Not to mention the fact
that it was your box cutter

12:42.320 --> 12:43.787
that was used
as the murder weapon.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.786
I told you,
someone must have taken it

12:45.830 --> 12:47.092
from my dressing room.

12:47.130 --> 12:48.825
Ithought
you said

12:48.860 --> 12:50.464
this wasn't going to take
more than an hour.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.491
You have somewhere
to be, Ms. Lanzer?

12:52.530 --> 12:54.339
As a matter of fact,
I need to get to the airport.

12:54.370 --> 12:56.258
Uh... (chuckles)
Excuse me?

12:56.300 --> 12:57.506
Oh, I'm catching
a flight

12:57.540 --> 12:58.564
to Montreal for
a master class

12:58.610 --> 13:00.168
I'm teaching tomorrow.

13:00.210 --> 13:01.802
It's been on
my schedule for weeks.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.171
Actually, I'd rather
that you didn't

13:03.210 --> 13:04.472
leave the city.
ATTORNEY:
I'm sorry.

13:04.510 --> 13:06.978
Is my client a suspect?
I didn't say that.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.045
But I'm not ready
to clear her, either.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.581
And since we are
in the middle

13:10.620 --> 13:12.383
of a murder investigation,

13:12.420 --> 13:14.513
some flexibility on her part
would be appreciated.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.050
IRIS:
This is ridiculous.

13:16.090 --> 13:18.479
If you need me,
I'll be in Montreal.

13:18.530 --> 13:21.328
Ms. Lanzer, I'm gonna give you
one last chance to reconsider.

13:21.360 --> 13:24.329
I'm gonna give you one last
chance to leave me alone.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.861
I did not hurt Nell.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.937
And if you keep implying
that I did, I will sue you.

13:29.970 --> 13:32.609
Detective.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.529
Iris Lanzer.
Don't touch me.

13:35.580 --> 13:39.368
You are under arrest
for the murder of Neil Solange.
ATTORNEY: Iris,

13:39.410 --> 13:41.549
I'll have you out in a
few hours. Don't worry.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.880
I would be remiss
if I didn't say I had my doubts

13:49.930 --> 13:51.579
about Ms. Lanzer's guilt.

13:51.630 --> 13:55.054
Yeah? Well, she didn't give
me much choice, did she?

14:02.270 --> 14:03.908
Hey.

14:03.940 --> 14:06.135
Hey. You missed some excitement
this afternoon.

14:06.170 --> 14:08.206
Yeah, I got a call from
Sherlock 20 minutes after

14:08.240 --> 14:09.878
I heard about
it on the news.

14:09.910 --> 14:12.947
Captain's been getting calls
from the tabloids all day.

14:12.980 --> 14:15.517
Obviously they think one
beautiful woman cutting another

14:15.550 --> 14:17.188
in half is gonna move
some papers tomorrow.

14:17.220 --> 14:18.585
Mm. Where's Iris now?

14:18.620 --> 14:20.156
Home. She made bail,

14:20.190 --> 14:21.612
but at least she can't
leave the country.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.628
So, I got your message.

14:23.660 --> 14:26.527
You're trying to track down a
homeless guy who may not exist?

14:26.560 --> 14:28.289
He exists.

14:28.330 --> 14:30.969
Army Sergeant
Zeke Frebeaux.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.560
Or, as his friend likes
to call him, Freebo.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.865
I found his picture at
one of the shelters.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.462
His jacket caught my eye.

14:39.510 --> 14:40.602
It's an official
Army-issued fleece.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.302
I was hoping you
could help me

14:43.350 --> 14:44.601
distribute that to, uh,
hospitals, radio cars.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.003
Yeah, yeah.

14:46.050 --> 14:48.268
Send me the file, all right?
Okay.

14:52.590 --> 14:54.581
(sighs)

15:04.730 --> 15:06.937
(pouring coffee)

15:08.470 --> 15:10.461
Good morning.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.933
Would you like some coffee?

15:12.980 --> 15:15.699
IRIS:
Uh, actually, I'd
prefer cappuccino.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.903
Do you have a machine?

15:25.750 --> 15:28.059
You seriously slept
with Iris Lanzer?

15:28.090 --> 15:29.512
It does evoke
a certain frisson, doesn't it?

15:29.560 --> 15:32.028
Mind you, it's the art
I find alluring, not the fame.

15:32.060 --> 15:33.425
Okay, she is a
murder suspect.

15:33.460 --> 15:34.722
In our case.
If anyone finds out...

15:34.760 --> 15:36.421
I'm feeling a little judged
again, Watson.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.599
It's probably because
I am judging you.

15:38.630 --> 15:40.962
I was very discreet.
As was Iris.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.139
Whom, I might add,
instigated the whole thing.

15:43.170 --> 15:44.398
She found me after she made bail

15:44.440 --> 15:46.704
and she stated her intentions
qUIte boldly.

15:46.740 --> 15:49.402
I sensed she wanted to learn
more about the Investigation.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.045
So, deciding that turnabout
was more than fair play,

15:52.080 --> 15:53.411
I thought I would
take the opportunity

15:53.450 --> 15:55.475
to learn more about her.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.181
Wait, you-you are claiming
that you had sex with her

15:57.220 --> 15:58.539
to advance the case?

15:58.590 --> 16:00.387
That was the primary
purpose, yes.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.354
Yesterday, at the station,

16:02.390 --> 16:04.620
I noticed a certain stiffness
in her right shoulder.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.150
She then cried out in pain

16:06.190 --> 16:07.418
when Detective Bell
attempted to move her

16:07.460 --> 16:09.052
by the same arm.

16:09.100 --> 16:12.399
This led me to suspect
a tear in her rotator cuff.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.068
It's an all-too-common
Injury In ballet,

16:14.100 --> 16:16.136
and one that hasn't yet
interfered with her dancing.

16:16.170 --> 16:18.365
It would make it impossible
for her to operate the pulley

16:18.410 --> 16:20.275
which was used
to move Ms. Solange's body,

16:20.310 --> 16:22.039
even with the counterweights.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.274
You know you could
have just asked her

16:23.310 --> 16:25.039
if she had a problem
with her shoulder.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.604
Actually, I couldn't,
'cause it's

16:26.650 --> 16:28.470
not uncommonfor _o|_de_r dancers
to lie about Injuries.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.147
So last night,
I paid particular attention

16:30.190 --> 16:31.316
to her range of movement,

16:31.350 --> 16:33.318
her avoidance
of certain pOSItions...

16:33.360 --> 16:35.487
Just cut to the chase.
My verdict: a small
but significant

16:35.520 --> 16:38.387
tear in her right rotator cuff.

16:38.430 --> 16:41.354
I am now quite convinced
that my initial instincts

16:41.400 --> 16:44.164
about her innocence
were correct.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.464
Sleep with her yourself,
if you don't believe me.
Oh, that's a great solution.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.331
Sherlock, Nolan
is expecting you.

16:50.370 --> 16:52.509
He'll give you full access
to my legal files.

16:56.610 --> 16:58.498
Who is, uh, um, Nolan?

16:58.550 --> 17:00.211
Her attorney.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.717
He handled the pushing case
against the photographer

17:01.750 --> 17:04.548
eight months ago and he's issued
several restraining orders

17:04.590 --> 17:06.410
against obsessive fans
over the years.

17:06.450 --> 17:08.418
You think one of them
Is trying to frame Iris?

17:08.460 --> 17:10.052
Join me at Nolan's office
to peruse his files

17:10.090 --> 17:11.125
and help me find out.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.697
I can't. I have
to go to Queens.

17:13.730 --> 17:17.188
Pursuing another development
in Hobo Hunt 2014?

17:17.230 --> 17:19.528
I got a hit off of Frebeaux's
photo that Marcus posted.

17:19.570 --> 17:22.130
Someone saw him arguing with
their neighbor the other week.

17:22.170 --> 17:25.139
Are you sure that tracking
Mr. Frebeaux warrants your time?

17:25.170 --> 17:27.070
I do have some experience
with street people

17:27.110 --> 17:29.169
and it's not uncommon _
for them to drop off the grid

17:29.210 --> 17:30.541
and then reemerge on their own.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.673
His friend
asked me to help.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.716
Iris Lanzer is an innocent woman
who's being railroaded

17:36.750 --> 17:39.310
by the NYPD.
A trial will bear that out.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.318
WOMAN:
I understand that, but...
You got that?

17:41.360 --> 17:42.679
Yeah, got it.
Front page, above the fold.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.823
Okay.
Thank you.

17:43.860 --> 17:46.124
Mr. Holmes, good
to see you again.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.151
Glad to know someone
in the department

17:48.200 --> 17:49.155
is not pre-judging my client.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.167
(click)

17:50.200 --> 17:52.088
Hmm.

17:52.130 --> 17:53.666
Huh.

17:53.700 --> 17:56.464
How do you like the, uh...
the old Commodore, hmm?

17:56.500 --> 17:59.230
Your automatic door closer.
I believe that is, uh...

17:59.270 --> 18:01.204
Exeter's Commodore model.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.502
Yeah, I recognize the, um...

18:02.540 --> 18:04.644
Quite the ear for detail.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.102
No wonder the police
keep you around.

18:06.150 --> 18:08.209
Yes, well.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.889
So, I take it these are
the files which pertain to cases

18:10.920 --> 18:12.478
you've handled for Iris, right?

18:12.520 --> 18:14.215
As I'm sure you've
figured out by now,

18:14.260 --> 18:16.888
she is a very
complicated person.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.184
But her money is no
less green, right?

18:21.360 --> 18:24.466
Well, you should see how many
hours I haven't billed her for.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.162
I don't represent Iris
for the money.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.896
I do it because
I admire her.

18:29.940 --> 18:32.431
Well, she is a
remarkable dancer.

18:32.470 --> 18:34.438
Oh, it's not just that. It's...

18:34.480 --> 18:36.129
It's her single-mindedness.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.899
She's completely committed
to her craft.

18:38.950 --> 18:42.317
I respect that. I think
I've learned a thing or two.

18:42.350 --> 18:45.581
So if I could get some help
just getting these to a taxi.

18:45.620 --> 18:49.909
Uh, respectfully, I'd rather
they not leave the firm.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.155
You're more than welcome
to go over them here.

18:52.190 --> 18:55.296
I have to leave for back-to-back
interviews about the case.

18:55.330 --> 18:57.423
I-I may require some time.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.789
Take all the time you need.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.263
Any credible suspect you find

19:00.300 --> 19:02.291
will make both
of our lives eaSIer.

19:02.340 --> 19:06.265
Also, because you may not
hear it from Iris,

19:06.310 --> 19:07.732
Thanks.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.743
Rachel Brown?

19:17.790 --> 19:19.246
Yes?

19:19.290 --> 19:20.712
I'm Joan Watson.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.729
I'm looking for a man
named Zeke Frebeaux.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.888
Apparently one of your neighbors
saw you arguing with him

19:26.930 --> 19:28.397
a couple weeks ago.

19:28.430 --> 19:30.295
Does he look
familiar to you?

19:30.330 --> 19:33.538
Of course he does.
He's my brother.

19:33.570 --> 19:36.596
Sorry about the mess.

19:36.640 --> 19:39.336
How long has your brother
been living on the streets?

19:39.370 --> 19:41.474
On and off
for about three years.

19:41.510 --> 19:44.707
Since he got back
from Afghanistan.

19:44.750 --> 19:48.379
He was diagnosed
with severe PTSD.

19:48.420 --> 19:51.480
And there were
problems with drugs.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.250
I try to track him down
every month or so.

19:54.290 --> 19:55.757
Two weeks ago,

19:55.790 --> 19:58.725
I found him camping out
at Gantry Plaza.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.456
I was able to get him
to come back here.

20:01.500 --> 20:02.728
For a good meal.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.888
New clothes.

20:05.930 --> 20:09.297
I begged him to stay,

20:09.340 --> 20:11.706
but he didn't want to.

20:12.970 --> 20:15.438
We, uh, had a fight outside,

20:15.480 --> 20:17.778
and that's probably
what the neighbor saw.

20:17.810 --> 20:20.244
Do you have any idea
where he might be now?

20:21.550 --> 20:24.587
He said something about
the shelter at St. Ignatius.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.349
I checked there.
They haven't seen him.

20:26.390 --> 20:29.382
It's so cold.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.320
You couldn't have made him stay.

20:33.860 --> 20:36.328
Here or at a shelter. He...

20:36.360 --> 20:37.964
He's an adult. He made a choice.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.366
If something's happened to him,
it's not your fault.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.637
(phone chimes)

20:47.410 --> 20:49.435
Well, I should get going.
IfI get a lead on your brother,

20:49.480 --> 20:50.447
I will let you know.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.606
You're s...

20:51.650 --> 20:53.311
You're still gonna look for him?

20:53.350 --> 20:54.612
Of course.

20:54.650 --> 20:58.381
I-I'm sorry.

20:58.420 --> 21:03.357
It just means a lot that someone
else is looking out for him.

21:03.390 --> 21:05.426
After reviewing Sharp's files,

21:05.460 --> 21:07.553
none of the fans Iris issued
restraining orders against

21:07.600 --> 21:09.921
struck me as viable suspects.
One of them died,

21:09.960 --> 21:11.598
one's battling cancer,

21:11.630 --> 21:14.599
one of them now herds sheep
in the Netherlands.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.438
But obviously, someone who lives
in this building has potential.

21:17.470 --> 21:20.473
Jake Picardo is the paparazzo
who took Iris to court

21:20.510 --> 21:22.535
for pushing him
and breaking his camera.

21:22.580 --> 21:25.378
_ He now resides
In apartment 10-D.

21:25.410 --> 21:28.413
I know you followed a lead
on the missing Mr. Frebeaux,

21:28.450 --> 21:30.384
but did you have to follow it
into an ashtray?

21:30.420 --> 21:33.651
You reek of smoke.
Someone at the house
I went to was a smoker.

21:33.690 --> 21:36.454
Someone at the house
you went to was a chimney.

21:36.490 --> 21:38.651
Mmm.
And they smoke Double T's.

21:38.690 --> 21:41.557
That is the cheapest
and most chemical-laden brand

21:41.600 --> 21:42.999
on the market.
Hmm.

21:43.030 --> 21:44.463
Still haven't read
my monographs

21:44.500 --> 21:45.922
on tobacco, I see.

21:45.970 --> 21:48.438
Back to Jake Picardo...
Iris recently renewed

21:48.470 --> 21:50.938
her restraining order
against him.
Why?

21:50.970 --> 21:54.599
Because she believed he had
started following her again.

21:56.410 --> 21:57.638
Iris Lanzer.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.648
Yeah, she's having
a rough week, isn't she?

21:59.680 --> 22:01.841
A fact which seems to give
you great satisfaction.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.348
What do you expect?
Bitch ruined my life.

22:04.390 --> 22:05.414
'Cause she
broke your camera?

22:05.450 --> 22:06.815
Which she refused to pay for.

22:06.850 --> 22:08.659
And then I take her to court,

22:08.690 --> 22:11.921
her lawyer says I dropped
my camera 'cause I was high.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.019
And then he introduces
all this testimony

22:14.060 --> 22:15.823
about how I had
this huge coke problem.

22:15.860 --> 22:19.398
Next thing I know,
my agency dropped me.

22:19.430 --> 22:21.569
A paparazzi agency fired you
over drug use?

22:21.600 --> 22:24.398
My boss was on some
clean-living kick at the time.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.738
Of course, six months later,
he's in rehab for oxy.

22:26.770 --> 22:28.374
But ever since that trial,

22:28.410 --> 22:30.401
all I get
are freelance gigs,

22:30.450 --> 22:32.406
which means I gotta pop
for every tip,

22:32.450 --> 22:34.577
every new piece
of equipment...

22:34.620 --> 22:35.917
Which reminds me,

22:35.950 --> 22:37.986
what do you think
of my new spy camera?

22:39.720 --> 22:42.712
'Cause it's, uh,
pretty fond of you, huh?

22:42.760 --> 22:44.853
I'm beginning to think
that you like it

22:44.890 --> 22:46.551
when women smash your cameras.

22:46.590 --> 22:48.399
Small wonder
you're so pleased

22:48.430 --> 22:49.795
with I_ris's_
current Situation.

22:49.830 --> 22:51.422
It must seem like
karmic retribution.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.438
The question is,
are you the kind of man

22:53.470 --> 22:54.835
who makes your own karma?

22:56.100 --> 22:58.068
Where were you two nights ago?

22:58.110 --> 23:00.738
Tuesday.
Uh, I was holed up in my van,

23:00.780 --> 23:02.907
waiting for one of those...
dumb kids

23:02.940 --> 23:05.101
from the vampire movies
to show at a club.

23:05.150 --> 23:06.549
He never did.

23:06.580 --> 23:07.615
Can you confirm that?

23:07.650 --> 23:09.811
No. Why would I need to?

23:09.850 --> 23:11.442
We're exploring the possibility

23:11.490 --> 23:14.118
that someone other than
Iris Lanzer killed Nell Solange.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.479
She's really

23:15.520 --> 23:16.487
got you snowed.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.885
I mean, if you knew

23:17.930 --> 23:20.694
even half_
of the manipulative crap

23:20.730 --> 23:23.153
she's into...
What kind of manipulative
crap are you talking about?

23:23.200 --> 23:24.758
And how would you
know about that?

23:25.900 --> 23:26.867
Was Iris right?

23:26.900 --> 23:28.436
Have you been following her?

23:28.470 --> 23:30.062
This has been fun,

23:30.100 --> 23:31.965
but I'd like you to leave.

23:32.010 --> 23:33.978
I got work to do and...

23:34.010 --> 23:34.999
(ringtone sounds)

23:35.040 --> 23:36.632
It's Detective Bell.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.069
He would like us back
at the precinct right away.

23:39.110 --> 23:41.544
I have a feeling
we'll be seeing you again.

23:41.580 --> 23:42.911
BELL:
Couple hours ago, a reporter

23:42.950 --> 23:44.884
at The Ledger received
an unmarked envelope

23:44.920 --> 23:46.888
containing this thumb drive.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.888
Now, there's
a voice mail on it

23:48.920 --> 23:51.150
that was left
by Iris Lanzer...

23:51.190 --> 23:53.181
for Neil Solange.

23:54.730 --> 23:57.858
IRIS: Nell, it's me.
Look, stop behaving

23:57.900 --> 24:01.836
like a hysterical little girl
and answer your phone.

24:01.870 --> 24:04.759
Did you really think you were
the first dancer I'd been with?

24:04.810 --> 24:05.902
Get this straight:

24:05.940 --> 24:07.498
You're not walking away from me,

24:07.540 --> 24:10.543
not without consequences.

24:13.050 --> 24:15.575
Now we know why we couldn't find
the new man in Nell's life.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.941
Because it_wasn't a man
at all; It was Iris.

24:25.060 --> 24:27.119
HOLMES:
You and Neil were
having an affair.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.958
Yes, but I didn't kill her.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.558
WATSON: Well, it certainly
seemed like you were ready to

24:31.600 --> 24:32.862
in that voice mail.
Well, I have

24:32.900 --> 24:34.868
a temper--
shouldn't be news to anyone.

24:34.900 --> 24:36.197
HOLMES: So, when
did your romance

24:36.240 --> 24:38.231
with Neil begin?

24:38.270 --> 24:40.773
A few months ago,
before we started work

24:40.810 --> 24:42.209
on the production.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.003
She broke off her relationship

24:44.050 --> 24:47.713
with Nicholas Orman
to be with you.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.843
She must have
been qUIte smitten.

24:49.880 --> 24:53.008
She was.

24:53.050 --> 24:56.816
But my interest in her
was a bit more practical.

24:56.860 --> 24:58.748
You were threatened by her.

24:58.790 --> 25:01.588
You thought she
might get the lead,

25:01.630 --> 25:04.064
so you seduced her and then
convinced her to step aside.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.999
Well, it worked.

25:07.030 --> 25:09.863
Just like it has before.

25:09.900 --> 25:13.677
That was the problem, actually.

25:13.710 --> 25:16.178
Nell had run into...
(sighs)

25:16.210 --> 25:18.872
one of my previous flings.

25:18.910 --> 25:22.277
She told Nell that I'd done
the same thing to her, and...

25:22.320 --> 25:25.118
that's when Nell called
and ended it.

25:25.150 --> 25:28.153
But if you were just using her,
why leave such an angry message?

25:28.190 --> 25:29.851
I mean, you already
had the lead.

25:32.860 --> 25:36.057
You'd actually begun
to care for her.

25:36.100 --> 25:39.160
My whole life,
I've loved the ballet.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.998
No person has ever compared.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.668
The idea that I might...

25:44.710 --> 25:48.305
give a role to anyone...

25:48.340 --> 25:50.774
I can't imagine.

25:53.920 --> 25:57.071
But with Neil...

25:57.120 --> 25:59.987
I finally...

26:00.020 --> 26:03.012
started to see
why someone might.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.920
The day after I
left the message,

26:06.960 --> 26:08.825
I apologized to her, and...

26:08.860 --> 26:11.260
she deleted it
right in front of me.

26:11.300 --> 26:15.134
Well, then how did it end up
in that reporter's hands?

26:17.640 --> 26:19.608
The other night,
you gave me your phone,

26:19.640 --> 26:21.107
um... to take some

26:21.140 --> 26:23.108
commemorative pictures.
I-I remember

26:23.140 --> 26:24.949
it was quite hot

26:24.980 --> 26:26.845
to the touch, the phone.

26:28.750 --> 26:31.617
It's been that way
for quite a while.

26:31.650 --> 26:32.844
Could I see it?

26:41.900 --> 26:43.868
Does the battery drain
quite quickly?

26:43.900 --> 26:45.629
Yeah. I figured

26:45.670 --> 26:47.023
it was just getting old. Why?

26:47.070 --> 26:51.029
_ Unusual heat is
an Indicator of... sprare.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.669
Yes, I think your phone
may have been cloned.

26:55.910 --> 26:57.673
And I have a fairly good idea

26:57.710 --> 26:58.847
who's responsible.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.678
So, Computer Crime Lab
found spyware

27:01.720 --> 27:04.018
on Iris Lanzer's phone,
just like you said.

27:04.050 --> 27:06.883
Now, he denied having anything
to do with it at first.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.717
Then we explained
that the phone's signals

27:08.760 --> 27:10.955
were being transmitted
back to his home IP address.

27:10.990 --> 27:12.355
That's when he lawyered up.

27:12.390 --> 27:14.995
All of this over
a broken camera.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.763
That's our cue.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.037
You got me, okay?

27:27.070 --> 27:28.799
I cloned Iris's phone,
and yeah,

27:28.840 --> 27:30.876
that's how I knew
they were... together.

27:30.910 --> 27:34.118
But I didn't leak that
voice mail to the press,

27:34.150 --> 27:35.970
and I didn't kill Nell.

27:36.020 --> 27:39.046
He does understand he's not
helping himself, doesn't he?

27:39.090 --> 27:40.910
Well, I can prove it.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.781
My client would like
to make a statement

27:43.830 --> 27:46.958
as to his whereabouts on the
night of Ms. Solange's death.

27:46.990 --> 27:48.924
But for the moment,
he pleads the Fifth.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.019
In the interest of aiding
the police's investigation,

27:51.070 --> 27:53.868
he'll waive that right,
provided the district attorney

27:53.900 --> 27:57.233
extends full immunity
on all charges.

27:57.270 --> 28:00.330
Before I can bring
this to the DA,

28:00.370 --> 28:04.101
I'm gonna need some sense
of what he was up to.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.347
(inhales)

28:07.380 --> 28:10.747
I was going to shoot a porno

28:10.790 --> 28:13.714
in Nell Solange's apartment

28:13.760 --> 28:16.320
with a bunch
of hidden video cameras.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.385
I wanted to catch
her and Iris

28:18.430 --> 28:20.079
in the act.

28:20.130 --> 28:22.018
I was gonna sell it

28:22.060 --> 28:24.028
to the highest bidder--
two smoking-hot dancers,

28:24.070 --> 28:26.061
one of whom
was Ms Lanzer.

28:26.100 --> 28:28.864
I could've named my price.

28:28.900 --> 28:31.505
I don't suppose you have
any way of verifying this?

28:31.540 --> 28:35.101
I set up three cameras
in Nell's bedroom,

28:35.140 --> 28:37.108
one in the shower.

28:37.140 --> 28:40.473
Pull 'em. You'll see
I was there most of the night.

28:48.820 --> 28:49.957
The police checked
Picardo's cameras.

28:49.990 --> 28:51.423
The footage confirmed his alibi.

28:51.460 --> 28:53.257
Okay, so he
didn't kill Nell.

28:53.290 --> 28:55.099
He still could have been the one

28:55.130 --> 28:56.927
that leaked that voice mail
to the press.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.769
It's unlikely that
he would lie about that

28:58.800 --> 29:01.394
given the nature of the other
things that he confessed to.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.068
I'm still of the opinion
that Iris is being framed.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.965
Which makes the killer
the most likely leaker

29:07.010 --> 29:09.205
of the message,
and so I've commenced scrubbing

29:09.240 --> 29:10.969
of the voice mail.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.341
Upon closer examination,

29:12.380 --> 29:15.372
I realized there were _two levels
of ambient n0Ise,

29:15.420 --> 29:18.548
which suggests it's a recording
of a recording.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.113
when she left the message;
the second captures

29:23.160 --> 29:24.525
the noises in the vicinity

29:24.560 --> 29:26.323
of the person
who recorded it again.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.999
IfI had to guess,
I would say they had

29:29.030 --> 29:31.999
physical access to Nell's phone.
It would've been a simple case

29:32.030 --> 29:34.237
of putting hers on speaker,
theirs on record.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.998
What are you doing
with that coat?

29:37.040 --> 29:38.200
Well, the guy that I visited

29:38.240 --> 29:39.867
yesterday in the hospital,
Morris Gilroy,

29:39.910 --> 29:41.571
he was released this afternoon.

29:41.610 --> 29:44.170
He's staying
at St. Ignatius shelter.

29:44.210 --> 29:45.177
That's not an answer.

29:45.210 --> 29:46.472
Well, he's on his meds now,

29:46.510 --> 29:48.068
so he should be clearer.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.111
I was going to go
to the shelter and see

29:50.150 --> 29:52.209
if he could tell me a little
more about Zeke Frebeaux.

29:52.250 --> 29:54.514
And while I was there,
I was gonna donate some clothes.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.118
So, can I take the coat?

29:56.160 --> 29:57.309
So, wh-why are you doing this?

29:57.360 --> 29:58.827
What, donating clothes?

29:58.860 --> 30:00.327
Eh, helping this man.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.998
Trying to find his friend.

30:02.030 --> 30:05.329
(quiet sigh)

30:05.370 --> 30:07.463
I've intruded. Sorry.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.832
No, it's...

30:09.870 --> 30:11.861
it's okay. It's...

30:11.910 --> 30:14.128
it shouldn't be a secret.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.398
Especially from you.

30:21.420 --> 30:25.311
My father is, uh...

30:25.350 --> 30:28.513
he's schizophrenic.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.482
And homeless.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.489
Your father lives in Scarsdale
and he's an author.

30:33.530 --> 30:35.498
No, that is my stepfather.

30:35.530 --> 30:37.998
My mother married him
when I was three.

30:38.030 --> 30:39.497
Uh, we all took his name.

30:39.530 --> 30:41.930
I-I'm talking
about my birth father.

30:46.270 --> 30:49.569
My mother was pregnant with me
when... when he got sick.

30:52.550 --> 30:55.610
I mean, she did her best, but...

30:55.650 --> 30:57.845
you know, it was a lot.

31:00.050 --> 31:03.417
They got divorced a few months
after I was born.

31:05.060 --> 31:08.894
He was in and out of
institutions for a while, but...

31:08.930 --> 31:12.468
for the last 15 years,
he's been on the streets mostly.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.195
Where?

31:15.240 --> 31:17.435
Here in New York.

31:17.470 --> 31:19.131
Do you see him?

31:19.170 --> 31:21.138
Well, that's why I volunteer.

31:21.180 --> 31:23.535
Sometimes he recognizes me.

31:23.580 --> 31:27.300
Sometimes he doesn't-- just
depends on if he's on his meds.

31:30.150 --> 31:32.311
I tried to get him
into a halfway house

31:32.350 --> 31:34.056
or a treatment program,
but, you know,

31:34.090 --> 31:37.685
he says he doesn't want it,
doesn't need it.

31:37.720 --> 31:42.020
It wasn't easy, but I realized
that I just had to accept it.

31:42.060 --> 31:44.620
I don't try
to talk him into it anymore.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.230
When was the last time
you saw him?

31:48.670 --> 31:51.366
It's been almost...

31:51.410 --> 31:53.162
two years.

31:53.210 --> 31:54.939
Mm.

32:02.020 --> 32:04.716
Program's done.
All right.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.945
Let me know how it goes.

32:13.660 --> 32:16.959
IRIS: Nell, it's me.
Look, stop behaving

32:17.000 --> 32:19.992
like a hysterical little girl
and answer your phone.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.133
(audio rewinding)

32:23.170 --> 32:26.139
Nell, it's me.
Look, stop behaving

32:26.170 --> 32:30.675
like a hysterical little girl
and answer your phone.

32:30.710 --> 32:33.247
I'm sorry about the other day.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.168
All the yelling and screaming.

32:35.220 --> 32:37.745
It's okay. You were having
an episode; that's normal.

32:37.780 --> 32:39.316
I know.

32:39.350 --> 32:41.716
What about when Ze_ke was taken--
were you IUCId then?

32:41.760 --> 32:43.182
It was late.

32:43.220 --> 32:45.427
I was maybe a block away.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.678
Saw some guy roughing him up.

32:47.730 --> 32:50.255
Forced him into a van.

32:50.300 --> 32:51.767
Can you describe him?

32:51.800 --> 32:53.427
White.

32:53.470 --> 32:55.097
I think.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.700
You said you already
checked for Zeke

32:57.740 --> 32:59.207
at the 23rd Street Shelter?

32:59.240 --> 33:00.537
Yeah, he hasn't been there.

33:00.570 --> 33:02.333
His sister
hasn't seen him, either.

33:02.380 --> 33:04.007
I don't know how much longer

33:04.050 --> 33:06.746
I can hold on
to his stuff for him.

33:06.780 --> 33:08.748
That's his bag?

33:08.780 --> 33:10.247
Can I take a look?

33:13.590 --> 33:15.751
Thanks.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.551
Double T.

33:23.600 --> 33:24.669
All he ever smoked.

33:24.700 --> 33:26.292
(chuckles)

33:34.140 --> 33:36.529
His folks.

33:36.580 --> 33:40.300
Oh. Thought you'd
recognize her.

33:40.350 --> 33:41.749
No.

33:43.250 --> 33:45.013
His sister.

33:48.120 --> 33:50.714
Does he have more than one?

33:53.630 --> 33:55.598
Mr. Holmes.

33:55.630 --> 33:59.088
My assistant told me
you came to visit.

33:59.130 --> 34:00.267
Comfy?

34:00.300 --> 34:01.836
I know that you're the one

34:01.870 --> 34:04.065
who recorded Iris's voice mail.

34:04.110 --> 34:07.739
Excuse me?
I also know_that
you recorded It here.

34:07.770 --> 34:09.704
What the hell
are you talking about?

34:09.740 --> 34:12.777
(click, whooshing)

34:12.810 --> 34:14.744
(click)
That noise.

34:16.350 --> 34:17.715
The distinctive noise

34:17.750 --> 34:19.217
of your trusty door closer.

34:19.250 --> 34:20.808
It makes a guest appearance

34:20.850 --> 34:23.819
on the recording's second layer
of ambient noise.

34:23.860 --> 34:27.159
Its appearance confounded me

34:27.190 --> 34:28.828
until I remembered

34:28.860 --> 34:31.727
that Neil had threatened her ex
with a restraining order.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.830
That she'd gone as far
as to consult a lawyer.

34:34.870 --> 34:36.792
You.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.832
Well, Iris was kind enough
to refer me.

34:39.870 --> 34:42.202
Nell and I met a couple
of times.

34:42.240 --> 34:44.276
That's no secret.

34:44.310 --> 34:47.108
Ultimately, she decided
not to follow through.

34:47.150 --> 34:49.573
But she did decide
to ask for your help with her

34:49.620 --> 34:51.542
when things grew messy
between them.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.615
A complicated situation for you

34:53.650 --> 34:55.618
'cause Iris was also
your client.

34:55.660 --> 34:58.879
I submit
that you recorded the meeting

34:58.930 --> 35:00.784
in order to avoid
a conflict of interest.

35:03.730 --> 35:06.699
Now, armed with proof

35:06.730 --> 35:08.891
of Neil and
Iris's affair,

35:08.940 --> 35:12.535
it struck you that if Nell
were to die at Iris's hand,

35:12.570 --> 35:15.175
and in dramatic enough fashion,

35:15.210 --> 35:17.770
the case _would become
a media sensation.

35:17.810 --> 35:21.143
First step--

35:21.180 --> 35:23.216
kill Nell.

35:23.250 --> 35:26.219
Or rather, prepare to kill her.

35:28.190 --> 35:31.182
You took Iris's
personalized box cutter,

35:31.230 --> 35:33.323
you went
to the theater the night

35:33.360 --> 35:35.351
before the dress rehearsal,
and you slit Nell's throat,

35:35.400 --> 35:38.369
and then you prepared her
for her grand entrance.

35:38.400 --> 35:42.689
Leaking Iris's voice mail
would demonstrate her motive...

35:42.740 --> 35:45.664
and the true nature
of their relationship.

35:45.710 --> 35:48.838
My office is not the only one
with that door closer.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.371
There must be... hundreds,

35:51.410 --> 35:53.378
thousands around the city.

35:53.410 --> 35:55.947
So, while that's a...

35:55.980 --> 36:00.485
good story,
you don't have any real proof.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.818
Well, I would say
that I had Iris.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.748
But I can't seem

36:04.790 --> 36:06.485
to reach her on her cell phone.

36:06.530 --> 36:10.250
She had a new one to replace
the one that was cloned.

36:10.300 --> 36:12.723
And I imagine you're
the only one with the number.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.237
As far as where she is,

36:14.270 --> 36:16.738
we agree she should keep
a low profile for now,

36:16.770 --> 36:18.408
so I set her up
someplace private.

36:18.440 --> 36:19.930
She'll have to come
to court eventually.

36:19.970 --> 36:21.631
Well, by that time,

36:21.680 --> 36:24.604
I will have convinced her
that you turned against us.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.902
You're just trying to trick her

36:26.950 --> 36:29.919
into incriminating herself.

36:29.950 --> 36:32.248
I would remind you
that the only attorneys

36:32.290 --> 36:34.485
who benefit
from cases of this magnitude

36:34.520 --> 36:36.988
are ones _ _
who have emerged Victoriously.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.829
I studied your
work, Mr. Sharp.

36:38.860 --> 36:42.250
You're a mediocre barrister
at best.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.268
I fear you may have stacked
the odds

36:44.300 --> 36:46.427
against your client too high.

36:46.470 --> 36:49.234
(clears throat)

36:51.640 --> 36:54.279
Iris Lanzer isn't going to jail.

36:54.310 --> 36:56.335
I promise you that.

36:57.980 --> 36:59.948
Now, if you'll excuse me...

36:59.980 --> 37:01.470
(clears throat)

37:01.520 --> 37:04.614
(click, whoosh)

37:04.650 --> 37:06.641
...I have work to do.

37:12.660 --> 37:14.628
(doorbell rings)

37:16.830 --> 37:18.661
Rachel, we're here for Zeke.

37:18.700 --> 37:21.021
He isn't here.

37:21.070 --> 37:23.334
That's funny,
because you and your house reek

37:23.370 --> 37:25.406
of his brand of cigarettes--
Double T's.

37:25.440 --> 37:28.432
I saw you throw an empty pack
away the other day.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.629
MAN:
Uh, they were mine,

37:29.680 --> 37:31.033
actually.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.479
Trying to quit.

37:32.510 --> 37:33.841
Can we help you?

37:33.880 --> 37:35.848
This is my husband Cliff.

37:35.880 --> 37:39.008
Cliff, this is the woman who's
helping to look for my brother.

37:39.050 --> 37:40.745
Zeke Frebaux is not
your brother.

37:40.790 --> 37:42.417
But that hasn't stopped you

37:42.460 --> 37:44.883
from cashing his veteran's
benefit checks, has it?

37:44.930 --> 37:47.421
Rachel told you
Zeke isn't here.

37:47.460 --> 37:49.018
Well, this search warrant says

37:49.060 --> 37:50.891
that we don't have
to take your word for it.

37:54.600 --> 37:57.433
A padlocked door
inside your house?

37:57.470 --> 38:01.770
You want to tell me what,
or who, you've got down there?

38:14.460 --> 38:17.088
There were three
homeless men altogether.

38:17.120 --> 38:20.920
One of them was on disability;
the other two were vets.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.393
That woman
and her husband

38:22.430 --> 38:23.920
had them chained
in their basement,

38:23.960 --> 38:25.325
collecting their benefits.

38:26.530 --> 38:28.589
Mr. Frebeaux's condition?

38:28.640 --> 38:31.029
All things considered, good.

38:31.070 --> 38:32.799
I spoke to his parents.

38:32.840 --> 38:35.775
They're hoping they can convince
him to come home this time.

38:35.810 --> 38:37.732
And if they can't?

38:37.780 --> 38:39.975
Well, it has
to be up to him.

38:46.750 --> 38:48.354
(sighs)

38:48.390 --> 38:50.813
You should be proud
of yourself, Watson.

38:53.460 --> 38:55.428
If only the
wheels of justice

38:55.460 --> 38:57.758
would turn as smoothly
in the case of Nolan Sharp.

38:57.800 --> 39:00.894
Well, he can't keep
Iris hidden forever.

39:00.930 --> 39:02.636
We'll find her.

39:02.670 --> 39:04.433
We'll explain.

39:04.470 --> 39:06.438
Oh, say we did.

39:06.470 --> 39:08.779
Won't prove anything.

39:08.810 --> 39:12.439
And while it would be greatly
satisfying to see her fire him,

39:12.480 --> 39:14.812
if might decrease her chances
of being exonerated.

39:14.850 --> 39:18.149
Well, she's being represented
by the same man who framed her.

39:18.180 --> 39:19.886
And as the actual murderer,

39:19.920 --> 39:21.911
he can use his intimate
knowledge of the crime

39:21.960 --> 39:23.609
to_ craft a defense
which Is far superior

39:23.660 --> 39:25.821
to that of a far less
homicidal attorney.

39:25.860 --> 39:28.749
Hmm. You should
have seen him.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.860
How utterly
confident he was.

39:31.900 --> 39:33.822
I'm sure he has some
ace in the hole,

39:33.870 --> 39:35.929
some piece of evidence
that he's holding back,

39:35.970 --> 39:37.892
something he's going to
use to exculpate Iris.

39:37.940 --> 39:39.532
Like what?

39:39.570 --> 39:41.106
I don't know.

39:41.140 --> 39:43.631
Perhaps he took a photograph
of himself

39:43.680 --> 39:44.999
as he slashed Nell Solange's
throat.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.870
Oh.
Perhaps
he smiled

39:46.910 --> 39:51.813
and winked at the camera
as he gave a big thumbs-up.

39:51.850 --> 39:53.818
What?

39:56.890 --> 39:58.755
While I doubt

39:58.790 --> 40:00.985
that they depict a smiling,
thumb-raising Nolan Sharp,

40:01.030 --> 40:03.658
there were pictures taken of him
that night.

40:03.700 --> 40:07.727
And I think he's going
to use them to exonerate Iris.

40:07.770 --> 40:10.034
_ _Iris Lanzer
Is an Innocent woman

40:10.070 --> 40:13.437
who the DA. has made the target
of a witch hunt.

40:14.710 --> 40:17.076
Yeah, savor the
moment, Mr. Sharp.

40:17.110 --> 40:19.908
From now on, the only person
you'll be defending is yourself.

40:19.950 --> 40:23.477
Ugh! Mr. Holmes,
is this going to take long?

40:23.520 --> 40:25.488
Because I'm due to address the
media on the courthouse steps.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.147
What do you think, Captain? Is
this going to take a long time?

40:27.190 --> 40:30.489
I'm thinking 25 to life.

40:30.520 --> 40:33.159
You mentioned the other day
that you often undercharged

40:33.190 --> 40:35.192
Iris for your hours.

40:35.230 --> 40:36.788
Her records
supported that.

40:36.830 --> 40:40.493
_It's not_ a crime
to give a friend a break.

40:40.530 --> 40:42.464
It is if you bi|| other
clients for that time.

40:42.500 --> 40:45.663
HOLMES:
Given the perfectly adequate
success of your practice,

40:45.710 --> 40:47.462
it seemed you must be making
up the difference elsewhere.

40:47.510 --> 40:49.239
It_wasn't much. It was
just a hunch, really,

40:49.280 --> 40:52.670
but sometimes, with the right
judge, a hunch is all you need.

40:52.710 --> 40:54.041
We procured a
search warrant

40:54.080 --> 40:56.173
to search your
offices this morning.

40:56.220 --> 40:57.676
We found this in your safe.

40:57.720 --> 41:00.188
HOLMES:
I recalled last night that

41:00.220 --> 41:02.256
Nell Solange's killer
stole the hard drive

41:02.290 --> 41:05.589
which collected the various
security feeds at the theater.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.257
I assumed at the time
he'd destroyed it

41:07.290 --> 41:08.791
'cause he_wantec_l
to protect his Identity,

41:08.830 --> 41:10.559
but that was before I realized

41:10.600 --> 41:12.591
that you and he
were one and the same.

41:12.630 --> 41:14.860
BELL:
We've already
reviewed the footage.

41:14.900 --> 41:16.629
_ Iris Lanzer
Isn't on there.

41:16.670 --> 41:18.194
Just some guy
in a mask.

41:18.240 --> 41:21.038
Funny thing is, he's about
your height and weight.

41:21.070 --> 41:22.606
HOLMES:
I'm curious, Mr. Sharp.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.130
Was the footage

41:24.180 --> 41:25.875
a fail-safe?

41:25.910 --> 41:29.573
A grenade to be unpinned
at trial, if and only if,

41:29.620 --> 41:31.884
your talents
as an attorney were insufficient

41:31.920 --> 41:33.217
to clear Iris's good name?

41:33.250 --> 41:36.253
Or was their appearance
as inevitable

41:36.290 --> 41:38.884
as your yen
for the spotlight is pathetic?

41:38.930 --> 41:40.886
GREGSON:
We've dropped all charges
against Ms. Lanzer,

41:40.930 --> 41:42.591
and we're placing you
under arrest

41:42.630 --> 41:44.996
for the murder
of Neil Solange.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.568
Don't worry about the reporters
outside. You look great.

41:55.810 --> 41:59.109
As, uh, relieved as I am
that the charges were dropped,

41:59.150 --> 42:01.744
my heart breaks
for Neil Solange.

42:01.780 --> 42:04.112
(sighs)

42:04.150 --> 42:07.039
She was very special to me...

42:07.090 --> 42:09.183
and I will truly miss her.

42:09.220 --> 42:12.553
Aside from being
an excellent dancer,

42:12.590 --> 42:14.558
as a person, she was...
What are those?

42:14.600 --> 42:16.852
Blankets. Extra blankets,
to be precise.

42:16.900 --> 42:18.720
I saw them in a closet,

42:18.770 --> 42:20.988
and I realized I haven't
needed them of late.

42:21.030 --> 42:23.237
Not with all the hot-blooded
company I've been enjoying.

42:23.270 --> 42:25.568
So, I thought we might
take them to the park and

42:25.610 --> 42:28.829
see if anyone was in need.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.337
I understand it's going
to be quite cold tonight.

42:31.380 --> 42:34.008
I'll get my coat.
