WEBVTT

00:02.927 --> 00:06.212
Jimmy. Jimmy.

00:07.390 --> 00:09.098
Stop! I said no!

00:10.685 --> 00:11.799
God!

00:11.894 --> 00:16.271
I sat my sorry ass on a torn-up bus
for three hours to hook up with you.

00:16.566 --> 00:18.225
If you only came to hook up,

00:18.317 --> 00:21.069
then you should've just stayed
in Charlottesville.

00:21.153 --> 00:22.316
Come on.

00:23.406 --> 00:25.149
You know I love you.

00:27.952 --> 00:29.779
- Come here. Come on.
- Jimmy.

00:29.870 --> 00:34.034
- Come on. Come on!
- Stop! Stop it or I'll scream!

01:29.355 --> 01:32.190
- Don't you lock the door?
- Nope.

01:32.275 --> 01:35.857
I got a call. Quantico.
Marine got killed in an exercise.

01:35.945 --> 01:37.108
How?

01:37.363 --> 01:40.317
Night training jump.
The guy's chute didn't open.

01:42.034 --> 01:43.445
This a boat?

01:47.039 --> 01:49.198
His reserve chute fail, too?

01:49.292 --> 01:53.788
I don't know. I tried your cell.

01:54.172 --> 01:56.211
Tried your hard line, too.

01:57.216 --> 01:58.545
Don't ask.

01:59.135 --> 02:01.377
You know, my dad gave me
a power sander for my birthday.

02:01.471 --> 02:04.044
I don't really power sand much.
You're welcome to it.

02:04.140 --> 02:07.509
Aside from that bare bulb there
and the plug going to that idiot box,

02:07.602 --> 02:10.056
you see a power cord
around here anywhere?

02:12.482 --> 02:14.439
You use hand tools, huh?

02:15.234 --> 02:18.069
I use my hands. Did you call Ducky?

02:18.154 --> 02:20.230
- Not yet.
- Give me your cell.

02:25.077 --> 02:28.363
- Coming, DiNozzo?
- He's a weirdo.

02:28.456 --> 02:31.576
Yeah. I got the... Light.

02:43.387 --> 02:45.179
He impaled an SUV?

02:45.264 --> 02:48.182
- Like he was laser-guided, sir.
- Where are the other jumpers?

02:48.267 --> 02:50.343
Over there, sir.
They landed in the drop zone,

02:50.436 --> 02:51.599
400 metres north of the road.

02:51.687 --> 02:52.850
Just one stick?

02:52.939 --> 02:55.477
Yes, sir. I guess the jumpmaster
held the others back

02:55.566 --> 02:57.108
when the victim's chute didn't open.

02:57.193 --> 02:58.953
Did you secure the paraloft
and the aircraft?

02:59.028 --> 03:00.570
Yes, sir. I also have the Marines

03:00.655 --> 03:02.466
who didn't make the jump
under guard at the hangar.

03:02.490 --> 03:04.843
Yeah, put them with the others.
Let's keep 'em all separated.

03:04.867 --> 03:06.065
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, my God.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.702
- These the witnesses?
- Yes, sir.

03:07.787 --> 03:08.818
My dad's gonna kill me!

03:08.913 --> 03:11.783
He's on duty and he doesn't know
that I took his SUV.

03:11.874 --> 03:13.914
- So your dad's a Marine?
- Yes, sir.

03:14.001 --> 03:17.417
Master Sergeant Tom Schaefer, sir.
He's a TI at Quantico.

03:17.505 --> 03:19.794
- Your dad a Marine, too?
- No way.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.376
You cold, Sarah?

03:22.969 --> 03:24.249
A little.

03:25.596 --> 03:26.841
How you doing?

03:28.849 --> 03:30.048
Thanks.

03:30.268 --> 03:32.509
- There you go.
- Thank you.

03:32.603 --> 03:36.601
Special Agent Gibbs.
Special Agent DiNozzo. NCIS.

03:38.943 --> 03:42.526
- Wanna tell us what happened?
- We were parked and...

03:42.613 --> 03:45.235
We were hanging out and
listening to Dashboard Confessional.

03:45.324 --> 03:46.403
What?

03:46.826 --> 03:49.115
- Emo.
- Emo?

03:49.662 --> 03:52.533
Emotional music.
You got to get a radio, Gibbs.

03:52.623 --> 03:55.541
Okay, so you were listening
to music and...

03:55.626 --> 03:58.627
- He smashed through the roof.
- And wham, pow, blood everywhere.

03:58.713 --> 04:00.456
I screamed and we ran out for help.

04:00.548 --> 04:02.985
I met them about a click down the road
on our way to the scene.

04:03.009 --> 04:05.297
I felt bad for leaving him there.

04:05.511 --> 04:07.967
- He was alive?
- I heard him groan.

04:08.055 --> 04:10.629
- It was a death rattle.
- You ever hear a death rattle?

04:10.725 --> 04:12.005
I was using that as a trope.

04:12.101 --> 04:13.726
- A what?
- A trope.

04:13.894 --> 04:16.730
A figurative use of expression.

04:16.814 --> 04:19.732
Yeah. Call her dad.
Have him pick her up.

04:19.983 --> 04:21.608
Does that mean I get to go?

04:21.694 --> 04:24.315
Not until after
Master Sergeant Schaefer gets here.

04:24.405 --> 04:27.489
I'm sure he's gonna have
a trope or two for you.

04:28.868 --> 04:31.988
- Ducky's here.
- And on a ladder. I'll get the monopod.

04:32.079 --> 04:34.487
The last time I was up this high

04:34.624 --> 04:37.992
I was hanging a piÃ±ata
at my nephew's birthday party.

04:38.502 --> 04:40.412
What have we got, Duck?

04:42.423 --> 04:43.668
Abrasions.

04:44.508 --> 04:47.082
The tree must have slowed him a bit.

04:47.178 --> 04:50.095
Purple discolouration,
neck's broken, I'd say.

04:50.348 --> 04:52.755
It's hardly surprising
given the rapid descent

04:52.850 --> 04:55.306
followed by
the equally rapid deceleration.

04:55.394 --> 04:59.178
Witnesses over there said that
he groaned after he decelerated.

04:59.273 --> 05:02.440
It's possible.
I won't know till I do the autopsy.

05:06.155 --> 05:08.611
Looks like a number
of his shroud lines failed.

05:08.699 --> 05:11.369
Enough of those go,
chute doesn't catch air,

05:11.452 --> 05:13.658
it tootsie-rolls,
let's you down like a Roman candle.

05:13.746 --> 05:16.996
- Were they cut?
- No, they look worn.

05:17.541 --> 05:20.412
Still got his reserve chute on.
Why didn't he pull it?

05:20.503 --> 05:23.872
Hey. Look who I found.
MP's weren't gonna let her pass.

05:23.964 --> 05:27.713
I got my sig and badge
but HQ didn't issue my photo ID.

05:29.887 --> 05:34.845
- God! Is this for real?
- Unfortunately, my dear, it is.

05:35.810 --> 05:40.519
- Put 'em on.
- Your first crime scene with us, Caitlin.

05:40.606 --> 05:42.100
What about Air Force One?

05:42.191 --> 05:44.397
It doesn't count.
You were in the Secret Service.

05:44.485 --> 05:48.186
Tony, take a team photo for posterity.

05:48.406 --> 05:50.066
Forget posterity.

05:50.533 --> 05:52.324
The sun's gonna be up soon.

05:53.077 --> 05:54.820
Welcome to NCIS.

05:59.291 --> 06:01.284
How did you know my size?

06:03.587 --> 06:06.754
Put 'em on.
You can't work a field in high heels.

06:09.385 --> 06:11.710
Depends on
the kind of work you're doing.

06:11.804 --> 06:15.552
Your mind, DiNozzo,
runs the gamut from "X" to "XXX."

06:15.933 --> 06:18.056
- Yeah?
- Photos, Tony.

06:18.602 --> 06:20.725
Yeah. Ducky?

06:21.897 --> 06:24.223
Why would Gibbs rip his hard line out

06:24.316 --> 06:27.483
and dunk his cell phone
in a jar of paint thinner?

06:27.570 --> 06:29.361
- Oh, dear.
- What?

06:29.447 --> 06:32.151
I should have realised the time of year.

06:33.451 --> 06:36.570
- It's his anniversary.
- Which marriage?

06:36.662 --> 06:38.619
The last one, of course.

06:38.706 --> 06:40.283
Isn't it always?

06:48.090 --> 06:51.625
Ducky, I'm not following.

06:52.052 --> 06:56.346
Every year, ex-wife number 3
gets drunk on their anniversary

06:56.432 --> 06:58.804
and calls him. Repeatedly.

06:59.977 --> 07:02.764
Why doesn't he change his number?

07:02.855 --> 07:06.271
I have no idea.
In case you haven't noticed,

07:06.358 --> 07:10.356
Gibbs is a man
of more questions than answers.

07:15.910 --> 07:17.368
Thanks, DiNozzo.

07:17.912 --> 07:20.663
You could be
the NCIS poster girl in that outfit.

07:31.926 --> 07:33.835
You JAG or NCIS?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.345
Do I look like a lawyer?

07:36.430 --> 07:39.680
Word's all over the base by now.
My men can't even call their family

07:39.767 --> 07:42.340
and let them know
that they're not the one who died.

07:42.436 --> 07:45.887
- Was Sergeant Fuentes married?
- He has a wife and son.

07:46.607 --> 07:49.394
Notification detail should be there
to talk to her by now.

07:49.485 --> 07:50.944
Word will get out who was killed.

07:51.028 --> 07:54.112
Sergeant Fuentes was
under my command. I'd like to see her.

07:54.198 --> 07:56.771
After we finish questioning
you and your men.

07:56.909 --> 07:59.780
- How long is that gonna take?
- I don't know.

07:59.912 --> 08:02.118
These men have another jump at 2100.

08:02.206 --> 08:03.451
They're jumping again tonight?

08:03.541 --> 08:07.159
We don't stop for casualties
in war, miss. Neither do we in training.

08:07.253 --> 08:08.628
Not true, Captain.

08:08.712 --> 08:12.164
They don't jump off a lower bunk
until we find out what happened.

08:12.258 --> 08:14.665
I don't take orders from NCIS cops.

08:14.760 --> 08:18.129
Special agents.
And you'll follow this order.

08:18.222 --> 08:20.096
Or what, Special Agent?

08:21.892 --> 08:23.766
I don't take orders
from your boss, either.

08:23.853 --> 08:26.972
I'm not calling my boss.
I'm calling yours.

08:28.983 --> 08:30.643
Commandant May?

08:31.402 --> 08:33.940
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

08:36.573 --> 08:39.195
I don't have a commandant
of the Marine Corps on my speed dial.

08:39.284 --> 08:41.158
The captain didn't know that.

08:41.328 --> 08:44.495
All right, DiNozzo, shoot and sketch.
Especially the static lines.

08:44.582 --> 08:47.286
Kate and I will start the interrogation.

08:47.418 --> 08:49.209
Jumping's got to be so cool.

08:49.295 --> 08:52.794
You wanna play paratrooper? Pay $180.

08:53.132 --> 08:56.335
Take your class
like all those other weekend warriors.

08:56.427 --> 08:58.882
Yeah, I have so many weekends free.

09:04.018 --> 09:05.809
Sergeant Fuentes lead your stick?

09:05.895 --> 09:09.263
Yes, sir. I was number two,
Ramsey was three, Brinkman four.

09:09.356 --> 09:12.191
First stick, you're up!
Fuentes, look sharp!

09:12.818 --> 09:16.650
Dafelmair, Ramsey, Brinkman.
Keep it tight.

09:16.739 --> 09:19.146
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Stand by.

09:19.241 --> 09:22.242
Go! Go! Go!

09:22.328 --> 09:24.616
After my chute deployed,
I looked around.

09:24.705 --> 09:26.745
I saw Brinkman's chute open above me.

09:26.832 --> 09:30.118
When I looked down,
I only saw one canopy below.

09:30.210 --> 09:32.962
I didn't know if it was, Paul or Thumper.

09:33.297 --> 09:36.084
- Thumper?
- That's what we called Fuentes, ma'am.

09:36.175 --> 09:39.341
It sounds crazy now, but he was
the squad's good luck guy, ma'am.

09:39.428 --> 09:41.385
- He was a walking rabbit's foot.
- Thumper.

09:41.847 --> 09:44.801
Yes, ma'am.
He always seemed to dodge the bullets.

09:44.892 --> 09:48.427
- We could tell you a million stories.
- Why don't you tell us just one?

09:48.520 --> 09:51.391
Well, sir. He bought himself
a new bike last week.

09:51.649 --> 09:55.481
Car ran a red light, he went over it
into a plate glass window.

09:55.569 --> 09:59.152
Dinged his collarbone a little.
Other than that, not a scratch.

09:59.239 --> 10:00.947
Dinged it a little?

10:01.492 --> 10:03.780
A day or two, he was fine, sir.

10:05.871 --> 10:07.200
Who reached him first?

10:07.289 --> 10:10.539
I did, sir. I saw him Roman candle
short of the field.

10:11.168 --> 10:13.920
As soon as I got out of my harness,
I took off to find him.

10:14.004 --> 10:15.083
You two?

10:15.172 --> 10:17.841
I hung up in a tree.
Dave gave me a hand.

10:17.925 --> 10:21.092
Saw Paul yelling. We joined him.

10:21.220 --> 10:25.467
I can't believe the way that
Thumper died. It was like a bad movie.

10:26.642 --> 10:29.394
Was he dead when you reached him,
Corporal Dafelmair?

10:29.478 --> 10:31.601
Yes, sir. He died on impact.

10:32.982 --> 10:34.939
I'm sure. Well, at least I hope he did.

10:35.025 --> 10:36.899
Why didn't he pull his reserve?

10:36.986 --> 10:40.070
Jumping from 1,300 feet,
your main fails,

10:40.489 --> 10:43.360
you have three, maybe four seconds
to react, ma'am.

10:43.450 --> 10:47.033
Okay, each of you need to prepare
a statement detailing what you saw.

10:47.121 --> 10:48.366
Yes, sir.

10:49.581 --> 10:53.745
No, no. Leave 'em.
Your gear is ours now.

11:02.219 --> 11:04.128
What'd you get out of that?

11:04.221 --> 11:07.424
- He didn't have time to pop his reserve.
- Why not?

11:08.392 --> 11:10.847
Obviously, his reaction time
was too slow.

11:11.729 --> 11:12.808
Nuts.

11:13.939 --> 11:15.599
Dinged collarbone.

11:15.941 --> 11:17.684
Injured clavicle hurts like hell.

11:17.776 --> 11:19.337
Takes more than
a couple of days to heal.

11:19.361 --> 11:21.852
Do you think
Corporal Dafelmair was lying?

11:21.989 --> 11:25.358
He was if he knew that Thumper was
taking painkillers so he could jump.

11:25.451 --> 11:26.909
That's stupid.

11:27.077 --> 11:29.948
No, that's a Marine.

11:33.379 --> 11:35.523
Our victim sustained a broken neck

11:35.611 --> 11:39.395
crushed vertebrae, multiple
leg fractures, a shattered pelvis...

11:39.490 --> 11:41.150
What about his clavicle?

11:41.951 --> 11:45.901
With all this massive skeletal damage,
you're curious about his clavicle?

11:46.247 --> 11:47.527
Humour me.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.660
Well, how did you know?

11:53.379 --> 11:57.329
There's a fine hairline fracture
on the left clavicle.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.998
- Which he...
- Incurred recently, but not last night.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.968
No, it's begun to mend.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.966
You two are beginning to scare me.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.179
Ducky, would that fracture
pain him much?

12:06.267 --> 12:08.141
Nothing too severe.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.014
But, of course,
the shock of a parachute opening

12:11.105 --> 12:12.932
would have hurt like blazes.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.222
How did you know?

12:14.317 --> 12:16.986
The girl in the SUV
said she heard him moan.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.401
Was he alive after impact?

12:20.323 --> 12:21.521
Briefly.

12:23.576 --> 12:27.526
Not too close, Caitlin.
I'll put it on the monitor.

12:27.622 --> 12:31.370
Yeah, he most certainly would have died
of massive trauma,

12:31.459 --> 12:33.866
but the technical cause of death

12:35.421 --> 12:38.956
was severing of the femoral artery.

12:40.635 --> 12:44.051
Yes, our young Marine bled to death.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.350
What happened to
the "Sad End to a Drano Drinker"?

12:53.439 --> 12:54.981
I did a new one.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.358
Art can't stand still, Tony.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.856
It was my favourite.
So, what's the new one?

13:01.030 --> 13:03.782
Self-inflicted gunshot wound
to the abdomen.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.029
Of course.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.762
I'm gonna call it "Blast from the Future".

13:06.786 --> 13:08.613
I figure with my
shotgun-shattered backbone,

13:08.704 --> 13:10.780
I've got, like, a Chagall feeling going on.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.447
- In a Manson Family way.
- Yeah.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.911
- Abby, you have my tox screen results?
- Yep, right over here.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.297
The victim tested positive
for Percocet and Vicodin.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.023
- Double your pleasure.
- Double your fun.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.338
What kind of levels?

13:23.427 --> 13:26.097
0.17. He was slow-juiced,
like a koala bear.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.015
My guess is that he popped it
right before he dropped.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.013
The Marines we questioned
in his string probably knew.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.309
- Why didn't they tell us?
- Semper Fi.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.022
You rat, you fry.

13:37.775 --> 13:38.938
Sorry.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.730
Was his reserve chute okay?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.813
Yeah, it was perfect.
All he had to do was pop it.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.658
Well, he might have
if his reflexes weren't slowed by opioids.

13:46.742 --> 13:47.857
Opioids?

13:47.994 --> 13:50.449
General term for opiates
and synthetic analgesics.

13:50.538 --> 13:54.203
- Go, Kate.
- You sure you were a Baltimore cop?

13:55.167 --> 13:57.493
Okay, he was too juiced
to pop his reserve.

13:57.587 --> 13:58.962
Maybe. Maybe not.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.525
You pump adrenaline when you jump.
Your main chute doesn't open,

14:01.549 --> 14:03.340
it would really kick into high gear.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.667
Gibbs, if he had
the reflexes to use it, why didn't he?

14:05.761 --> 14:06.876
I don't know.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.378
What did you find
from the shroud lines of his main chute?

14:09.473 --> 14:13.471
Fibre disintegration.
But not from textile fatigue.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.348
It's fluorescing
as some sort of cleansing agent

14:16.439 --> 14:18.894
but that didn't cause
this kind of damage.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.186
Edges look melted.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.564
I haven't tagged it yet,
but it was definitely an acid

14:23.613 --> 14:26.234
that shredded the lines holding
300 pounds of a jumping Marine.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.844
How long to find the acid
and check out the rest of those chutes?

14:28.868 --> 14:32.403
- I'm flying solo, so at least a day.
- Go faster if you had an assistant?

14:32.496 --> 14:35.747
- Definitely.
- Okay. You got the job.

14:36.459 --> 14:37.538
I get to do forensics?

14:37.627 --> 14:40.034
No, you get to schlep for Abby.
She gets to do forensics.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.139
Why didn't you tell us
you were a rigger, Corporal?

14:55.227 --> 14:56.805
Thought you knew, sir.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.094
Did you?

15:00.483 --> 15:01.562
What's next?

15:01.651 --> 15:04.272
Sign the log
and stick it in the chute pocket.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.737
Same signature.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.097
That was the log from Thumper's chute,
wasn't it, sir?

15:14.121 --> 15:16.161
Yeah. You packed it.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.039
Sir, I didn't know
he'd get one that I packed.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.534
The chutes are handed out randomly,
even when we jump.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.998
- Riggers usually go on jumps?
- On training runs, yes, sir.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.585
How many riggers jumped last night?

15:26.676 --> 15:29.345
Corporal Ramsey,
Brinkman, and Thumper, of course.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.587
- He was senior rigger.
- Figure we knew that, too?

15:31.681 --> 15:34.931
- Sir, we weren't trying to hide anything.
- Like hell you weren't, Corporal.

15:35.017 --> 15:38.801
You all knew Thumper was using
painkillers for that dinged collarbone.

15:39.855 --> 15:42.560
He died 'cause
he was too juiced to pull his reserve.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.355
Sir, there is no way
for anyone to sabotage a chute

15:45.444 --> 15:47.318
and count on it
getting to a specific jumper.

15:47.405 --> 15:48.965
- All those chutes packed here?
- Yes, sir.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.365
We prepped them at 0900.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.358
Put 'em on the trucks
for the jump at 1800.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.111
They were here for nine hours,
unattended?

15:54.203 --> 15:56.279
- Under lock and key, sir.
- Who's got the key?

15:56.372 --> 15:59.575
Captain Faul and Thumper,
as senior rigger, both have keys.

16:05.548 --> 16:09.592
You had a criminal record
before entering the Corps, Corporal.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.929
- I made a few mistakes, sir.
- Shoplifting.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.429
- Drug possession?
- That was a long time ago, sir.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.968
- Three years. Not so long.
- Look, sir, you have my file.

16:20.062 --> 16:23.478
You know the judge
gave me a choice, prison or the service.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.854
The Corps gave me
a second chance, sir.

16:26.694 --> 16:30.478
And I would never do anything to hurt it
or one of my brother Marines.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.943
Never, sir.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.463
Carl Sagan time.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.796
Sulphuric acid. That would
chew the shine off a trailer hitch.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.266
How'd you get into this?

16:59.602 --> 17:04.310
- Filled out an application.
- I mean forensics.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.940
When I was a kid, we lived near this lot

17:08.027 --> 17:10.946
where they brought all the burned-out
hulks from the gnarliest car wrecks.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.146
I used to sneak in there
at night and take pictures.

17:13.240 --> 17:16.775
It wasn't about the gore. It was about
figuring out how things happened.

17:16.868 --> 17:20.736
You know, like action, reaction,
and the science of the whole thing.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.657
I got hooked. How about you?

17:24.502 --> 17:26.957
Actually, I wanted to be a lawyer.

17:27.171 --> 17:31.714
I did a year in law school.
It felt like 10 years in prison.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.669
With really boring inmates?

17:36.180 --> 17:39.181
Admit it, you just like
strapping on a gun.

17:40.518 --> 17:43.305
- More than one.
- Really?

17:43.395 --> 17:45.886
You're packing more heat
than meets the eye?

17:46.357 --> 17:50.354
- Those your only tattoos?
- You show me yours, I'll show you mine.

17:53.823 --> 17:54.937
Go!

17:55.032 --> 17:58.199
- You ever jump?
- When I get an electric shock.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.617
Explains the lack of power tools.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.829
- You gonna do it?
- What?

18:03.332 --> 18:05.870
Spend a $180 to defy gravity?

18:05.960 --> 18:08.083
- Yeah, I think I am.
- Agent Gibbs.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.756
This came for you, sir.
I just missed you at the paraloft.

18:13.968 --> 18:16.209
- Thank you, Lance Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.883
- Who's it from?
- Ducky.

18:24.854 --> 18:28.519
"Jethro, the bean counters couldn't
find you, so they gave this to me.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.394
"I suggest you read
the instructions on call-blocking."

18:31.485 --> 18:33.063
That addressed to you?

18:34.280 --> 18:35.690
It works.

18:38.742 --> 18:41.316
Gibbs.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.535
Yeah. I can be there in 20.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.877
You know, some of these guys
freeze on their first jump.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.038
Have to be kicked
in the ass to get 'em out.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.170
- Not me.
- No.

18:54.383 --> 18:58.048
You fall in the category
"I want a kick in the ass on the ground."

18:58.762 --> 18:59.842
Go!

19:02.600 --> 19:06.348
- Very Electric Kool-Aid, Abby.
- I was thinking more Blue Man Group.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.564
Sergeant Fuentes' chute
wasn't the only one tampered with.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.973
- How many?
- Nine out of 16.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.558
Log book signatures
show different riggers packed the lot.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.562
How many
did Corporal Dafelmair pack?

19:16.655 --> 19:18.778
Four. The rest were packed by
Corporal Brinkman

19:18.866 --> 19:19.945
and Sergeant Fuentes.

19:20.034 --> 19:22.572
- Corporal Ramsey didn't pack any?
- Nope.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.598
When his signature
didn't show up on a single chute

19:24.622 --> 19:25.653
I called Captain Faul.

19:25.748 --> 19:29.448
He put Corporal Ramsey on a two-week
rigging suspension for sloppy work.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.583
And guess who wrote him up
for that sloppy work?

19:31.670 --> 19:34.126
Senior rigger, Sergeant Fuentes.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.122
We got motive.

19:36.216 --> 19:39.134
We have more than that.
Kate and I have a theory.

19:39.219 --> 19:42.754
- Why didn't you take to me this fast?
- You're like a piercing, Tony.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.932
It takes a while for the throbbing to stop
and the skin to grow back.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.889
- That's more than I wanted to know.
- What's the theory?

19:48.979 --> 19:53.059
Okay, every time you lace up your Docs
or cinch your laundry bag

19:53.150 --> 19:54.525
you leave some skin cells behind.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.935
It's the same with a parachute rigging.

19:58.113 --> 20:00.439
I pulled skin samples from
the deployment bags

20:00.532 --> 20:01.885
of the chutes that were futzed with.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.533
Did you get a DNA signature?

20:03.619 --> 20:07.070
All nine knots had a number of
different sets of skin samples

20:07.164 --> 20:09.869
but there's only one set
that's common to all nine.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.417
The saboteur.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.411
Our riggers of record
packed the chutes.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.255
Then someone came in and repacked
them, leaving some skin behind.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.668
Corporal Ramsey.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.292
Well, depending on how much
he knows about forensics

20:20.386 --> 20:22.046
he's either very smart or very dumb.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.366
There's got to be other chutes
that Corporal Ramsey packed

20:24.390 --> 20:26.299
in the paraloft inventory for comparison.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.974
Negatory. I checked. They were all
packed since he's been suspended.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.268
There's an armed forces' DNA Registry.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.847
All military personnel
are on record, right?

20:35.234 --> 20:36.396
Yeah.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.443
Then we got our guy.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.322
No. All we've got is a pile of dead skin.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.526
The only thing you can use the
DNA Registry for is to identify a body.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.743
There has to be a way around that.

20:49.289 --> 20:52.374
See? Now you're thinking like
an NCIS agent.

20:56.248 --> 20:58.918
We know that nine parachutes
were rigged to fail.

20:59.001 --> 21:01.290
The killer doctored them
and repacked them.

21:01.378 --> 21:04.000
Sergeant Fuentes died
as a result of that.

21:04.965 --> 21:07.088
That's premeditated murder.

21:08.010 --> 21:09.290
I'm sold.

21:10.095 --> 21:12.302
If I'm on the jury, you got my vote.

21:13.307 --> 21:17.091
We found DNA evidence
on the chute deployment bag knots.

21:17.186 --> 21:18.645
Belonging to your suspect?

21:18.729 --> 21:22.727
We believe so. To be certain, we have
to access the Armed Forces Registry.

21:22.816 --> 21:24.275
That's impossible.

21:24.360 --> 21:28.772
The Registry was set up to identify
remains only. He knows that.

21:29.198 --> 21:30.312
I do?

21:31.700 --> 21:35.283
He tried to use it when he went after
Commander Rabb for murder.

21:35.496 --> 21:36.610
He get him?

21:36.705 --> 21:38.994
No, because he wasn't guilty.

21:39.083 --> 21:41.122
You couldn't use the DNA Registry then.

21:41.210 --> 21:43.535
What makes you think
you can use it now?

21:44.088 --> 21:45.463
You, Lieutenant.

21:46.382 --> 21:50.545
You're a smart lawyer
and you know the law.

21:57.017 --> 21:58.476
I know why I'm here.

21:58.769 --> 22:01.307
I hope so. I requested you.

22:01.397 --> 22:03.769
Yeah, you requested me
because you think you can work me

22:03.857 --> 22:06.183
like you did last time,
when I ratted out Commander Rabb.

22:06.277 --> 22:10.060
You did not rat on anyone.
You told the truth.

22:11.865 --> 22:16.611
I gave my uniform an extra lint roll
this morning, Agent Gibbs.

22:17.162 --> 22:19.321
And you waltzing around
in my blind spot,

22:19.415 --> 22:21.538
not gonna intimidate me this time.

22:22.501 --> 22:24.707
We're at 24 hours now,
and soon it's gonna be 48.

22:24.795 --> 22:27.120
You've done investigations,
you know what that means.

22:27.214 --> 22:29.088
I've done Jagman investigations.

22:29.174 --> 22:32.425
Sure, at 48 hours your evidence begins
to degrade, disappear.

22:32.511 --> 22:36.212
Witnesses change their stories,
suspects improve theirs. I know.

22:36.307 --> 22:37.849
- So help us.
- No!

22:37.933 --> 22:41.384
You're not gonna get me to lawyer you
past an iron-clad prohibition

22:41.478 --> 22:43.186
that prevents tapping into DNA records

22:43.272 --> 22:45.893
that were designed to identify bodies,
not chase suspects.

22:45.983 --> 22:48.688
This guy is guilty. He killed him.

22:48.861 --> 22:51.778
Let him drop to his death
from 1,300 feet.

22:51.864 --> 22:54.699
- It doesn't matter.
- For every legal firewall

22:54.783 --> 22:56.491
there is a way around it.

22:57.745 --> 22:59.120
I can't help you.

22:59.788 --> 23:02.279
And can I please have my pen back?

23:02.875 --> 23:06.872
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure you can.
You're gonna need it.

23:06.962 --> 23:09.121
Because if I can't have my DNA

23:09.214 --> 23:12.381
I'm gonna need some
search authorisations signed.

23:14.887 --> 23:17.212
You knew Lieutenant Roberts
wasn't going to lawyer us

23:17.306 --> 23:18.883
access to the military DNA database.

23:18.974 --> 23:20.137
- Did I?
- You did.

23:20.225 --> 23:22.218
So why go through the exercise?

23:22.561 --> 23:26.144
Kate, I come from a long line
of horse traders.

23:26.231 --> 23:29.814
First rule, you pick
the best horse in the barn

23:29.902 --> 23:31.894
and you work the deal until it bursts.

23:31.987 --> 23:33.631
That way, when you go
for the second-best nag,

23:33.655 --> 23:35.399
you get her for a song.

23:35.491 --> 23:38.694
- The search authorisation.
- We didn't have probable cause,

23:38.786 --> 23:42.237
but the lieutenant,
he's a man who aims to please.

23:42.998 --> 23:46.747
You never work the system
when you can work the people.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.498
Did any of those horse traders
you come from get hung?

23:49.588 --> 23:50.963
Yeah. A few.

23:51.965 --> 23:54.088
Did you find out what Ramsey
was written up for?

23:54.176 --> 23:58.885
Yeah. Frayed lines, bent cones,
cuts in the canopy.

23:59.014 --> 24:01.775
I'll tell you, I hope this guy isn't going
to medical school at night.

24:01.850 --> 24:04.092
- Yeah, scuttlebutt is...
- Scuttlebutt?

24:04.186 --> 24:06.891
That's Marine for water-cooler gossip.

24:07.606 --> 24:10.275
The scuttlebutt is
that Ramsey took a swing at Thumper

24:10.359 --> 24:12.102
for getting him suspended.

24:17.449 --> 24:19.442
"Identity withheld."

24:19.993 --> 24:22.200
Probably the reason you married her.

24:23.455 --> 24:26.622
I mean, she probably hid
her real personality, as most women do,

24:26.708 --> 24:29.959
and, by that time,
it was too late 'cause you'd already...

24:30.963 --> 24:32.587
I'm gonna shut up now.

24:33.132 --> 24:34.211
Now?

24:34.675 --> 24:37.296
Did you really just say
"as most women do"?

24:37.386 --> 24:41.300
Meet me at the paraloft at 1400.
I'll execute our search authorisations

24:41.390 --> 24:42.932
to go through the riggers' lockers.

24:43.016 --> 24:47.477
- That's 2:00 Secret Service time, Kate.
- We used Zulu time, Tony.

24:47.855 --> 24:51.389
- Zulu time. Yeah, that would be...
- 1900.

24:51.900 --> 24:53.478
I knew that.

25:07.416 --> 25:10.666
Hey. Can I come up?

25:15.048 --> 25:16.840
Do I need a password?

25:19.678 --> 25:22.050
Maybe I'll just come up a little.

25:28.395 --> 25:30.851
You really should have a password.

25:31.815 --> 25:32.846
Why?

25:35.819 --> 25:38.026
It's never gonna be finished.

25:39.948 --> 25:41.573
My dad's dead.

25:42.242 --> 25:44.199
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

25:44.828 --> 25:46.204
Who are you?

25:49.124 --> 25:51.496
I'm Jethro Gibbs.

25:52.377 --> 25:53.540
NCIS.

25:53.629 --> 25:56.546
I don't have time to answer questions.
We're on our way to the funeral.

25:56.632 --> 25:59.419
- I'm not here to ask questions.
- Then why are you here?

25:59.510 --> 26:02.795
- He says I need a password, mom.
- What?

26:04.056 --> 26:06.725
I told him a tree house
should have a password.

26:12.356 --> 26:14.644
Yeah, Larry was building that for him.

26:15.609 --> 26:17.233
Doing a good job.

26:23.033 --> 26:24.693
Larry was a good man.

26:25.494 --> 26:27.949
A good husband and a good father.

26:28.288 --> 26:29.451
Good Marine.

26:31.291 --> 26:34.162
There are rumours
that his death wasn't an accident.

26:34.670 --> 26:36.793
Whatever happened, Mrs Fuentes,

26:37.589 --> 26:39.416
I'll find who's responsible.

26:44.429 --> 26:47.051
Billy, we have to go.

26:53.939 --> 26:56.145
Look at you.

26:57.401 --> 27:01.350
Dusty. Come here. Your hair's a mess.

27:01.446 --> 27:02.905
Where's your combs?

27:02.990 --> 27:05.397
Larry always told him to carry a comb.

27:05.492 --> 27:08.826
Like JFK. Whoever he is.

27:09.997 --> 27:13.033
He was a Navy guy.
Like your dad was a Marine.

27:16.086 --> 27:20.665
Navy guys and Marines,
they always look their best.

27:21.758 --> 27:24.878
Your dad would want you
to look your best today for him.

27:25.304 --> 27:28.673
I don't want the Marines
at the funeral to see me cry.

27:29.808 --> 27:32.180
Never be ashamed of tears, bud.

27:33.145 --> 27:35.814
- Marines don't cry.
- Yeah, they do.

27:36.523 --> 27:40.603
At JFK's funeral,
his son saluted the coffin.

27:41.987 --> 27:43.611
You know how to salute?

27:47.701 --> 27:48.946
Perfect.

27:51.997 --> 27:53.740
You salute your dad today.

27:55.250 --> 27:57.124
Nobody'll notice tears.

28:01.465 --> 28:02.959
We have to go.

28:11.391 --> 28:14.013
I believe you'll get whoever did this.

28:14.728 --> 28:16.804
You have my word.

28:23.820 --> 28:26.655
Got to keep your feet together,
cushion the impact.

28:27.532 --> 28:28.695
That's it?

28:29.159 --> 28:31.650
You signed the release
to notify next of kin, right?

28:31.745 --> 28:34.070
Just don't say "break a leg".

28:35.582 --> 28:36.697
All right.

28:40.420 --> 28:42.994
- How was that?
- Very ladylike.

28:43.173 --> 28:46.423
DiNozzo, what are you doing?

28:46.843 --> 28:49.928
I'm just doing a little research for Abby.

28:50.681 --> 28:51.961
For Abby?

28:52.808 --> 28:55.429
Well, maybe I'm serving two masters.

28:55.977 --> 28:57.555
You're serving one now.

29:00.524 --> 29:04.106
- How'd you get into NCIS?
- I smiled.

29:05.987 --> 29:09.736
I had the riggers' lockers sealed
immediately after the incident, sir.

29:14.162 --> 29:15.277
Keys.

29:42.858 --> 29:44.103
Got something.

30:03.879 --> 30:06.880
- Brass-stripper solvent.
- Read the contents.

30:13.764 --> 30:17.892
"Contains petroleum distillant,
ammonia, and sulphuric acid.

30:18.560 --> 30:22.178
"Harmful if swallowed."
Or applied to shroud lines.

30:23.565 --> 30:24.940
Ramsey's locker.

30:25.776 --> 30:26.974
That stuff's not mine.

30:27.068 --> 30:30.402
Sergeant Nutt,
place the corporal in custody.

30:30.489 --> 30:31.769
Tony, read 'em.

30:31.865 --> 30:34.985
"You have the right to remain silent
and make no statement at all.

30:35.076 --> 30:36.179
"Any statement that you make

30:36.203 --> 30:39.239
"can be used against you
in a trial or court-martial..."

30:42.584 --> 30:46.748
Scuttlebutt has it that you and Thumper
mixed it up in the paraloft.

30:47.589 --> 30:49.546
We exchanged words, sir.

30:50.008 --> 30:51.336
And fists.

30:51.593 --> 30:54.084
A punch or two was thrown.
Nothing serious.

30:55.055 --> 30:57.972
But I damn sure wasn't
angry enough to kill him, sir.

30:58.433 --> 31:00.805
Well, maybe you only meant
to scare him.

31:00.936 --> 31:05.763
But Thumper was on pain killers
and didn't have time to pull his reserve.

31:05.857 --> 31:08.692
I didn't touch his chute, sir.
How could I?

31:08.777 --> 31:12.027
I'm on suspension
and the paraloft is under lock and key.

31:14.032 --> 31:15.443
What'd you find?

31:15.617 --> 31:18.571
Hardware store
where our guy did one-stop shopping.

31:18.662 --> 31:20.868
Clerk's pretty fuzzy.
He does remember a Marine

31:20.956 --> 31:22.865
in a real hurry to copy a key.

31:27.254 --> 31:29.293
All you needed was a key

31:31.091 --> 31:32.585
like this one.

31:34.845 --> 31:37.217
I found this in Thumper's
personal effects.

31:37.305 --> 31:41.255
If that's the paraloft key, you won't find
one like that on my key chain.

31:41.518 --> 31:44.009
I've messed up some rigging, sir,
but never intentionally.

31:44.104 --> 31:47.473
A guy jumps with one of my chutes,
he puts his life in my hands.

31:47.566 --> 31:51.350
- I'd never breach that trust, sir. Never.
- Now,

31:57.284 --> 32:00.949
are you gonna tell me
that was a plant, too?

32:01.037 --> 32:03.991
It had to be. I'm not guilty, sir.

32:05.166 --> 32:07.740
They're always so sincere
when they say that.

32:08.003 --> 32:10.873
What if I was to give you an offer
to prove that?

32:11.339 --> 32:12.715
Anything, sir.

32:13.466 --> 32:16.337
You'd be willing to give us
a sample of your DNA?

32:18.054 --> 32:21.423
Someone put that box in my locker
and that key on my keychain.

32:21.516 --> 32:23.509
How do I know that
you don't have my DNA

32:23.602 --> 32:25.808
on something else they planted, too?

32:26.605 --> 32:27.933
You don't.

32:35.640 --> 32:39.969
DiNozzo, where'd you learn
how to write? China?

32:41.313 --> 32:43.804
I'd say Egypt. Looks
more like hieroglyphics.

32:43.898 --> 32:45.974
Hey! You were in a rush to read it.

32:46.443 --> 32:47.474
My mistake.

32:47.569 --> 32:49.755
Are those the interviews
with the Marines that didn't jump?

32:49.779 --> 32:51.632
It's not very
interesting unless you want to hear...

32:51.656 --> 32:55.108
Corporal Ramsey finally gave it up.
His mouth was drier than mummy dust.

32:55.201 --> 32:57.823
I had to swab it four times
to get a decent DNA sample.

32:57.912 --> 32:59.905
How long to test for a match
on those skin cells?

32:59.998 --> 33:03.118
Only if you want no runs, drips or errors
in court, you got to give me 24.

33:03.209 --> 33:04.787
Abby, clock's ticking.

33:06.254 --> 33:09.006
You don't expect a guilty man
to give up his DNA.

33:09.090 --> 33:10.371
He's rolling the dice,

33:10.467 --> 33:13.005
hoping for that
one-in-a-million shot it won't match.

33:13.094 --> 33:15.668
- Guilty people do that?
- All the time.

33:16.181 --> 33:18.422
Wait a minute, Kate has a point.

33:18.600 --> 33:22.348
What if Ramsey was set up?
What if he's innocent?

33:22.437 --> 33:24.015
What if he's telling the truth?

33:24.105 --> 33:26.810
We'll know in 24 hours,
but wouldn't bet on it.

33:26.900 --> 33:29.086
Yeah, well, you know what?
I don't like sitting on my ass

33:29.110 --> 33:30.521
waiting for a DNA match.

33:30.612 --> 33:32.439
There are only two other
possible suspects.

33:32.530 --> 33:34.404
Corporal Dafelmair or Brinkman.

33:34.491 --> 33:36.863
Nope, there's three.
You're forgetting Captain Faul.

33:36.951 --> 33:38.909
He's got a key to the paraloft.

33:39.579 --> 33:43.363
Where do you think you're going,
bubba? You got a report to finish.

33:45.418 --> 33:48.834
Sergeant Fuentes was one of
the finest NCO's in my command.

33:48.922 --> 33:53.334
He was tough on his riggers, but fair.
And I still find it difficult to believe

33:53.426 --> 33:56.000
his reporting Corporal Ramsey
drove him to murder.

33:56.096 --> 33:58.717
Corporal Ramsey
hasn't been proven guilty yet, Captain.

33:58.807 --> 34:01.677
You're holding him.
Scuttlebutt is he's confessed.

34:02.060 --> 34:05.061
Never knew a Marine captain
who believed scuttlebutt.

34:07.524 --> 34:09.849
How'd you prepare
the day of the exercise?

34:09.943 --> 34:13.608
I spent the morning at a chalk talk with
the Navy aviators piloting the C-130.

34:13.696 --> 34:17.315
- I noticed you used a Navy bird.
- Most of ours are deployed in Iraq.

34:17.409 --> 34:20.362
- You eat lunch with them?
- At the officers' mess.

34:20.578 --> 34:22.452
But after lunch,
we made a couple of dry runs,

34:22.539 --> 34:24.994
had another chalk talk
and then loaded up.

34:26.418 --> 34:27.532
Why?

34:27.627 --> 34:29.998
Do you have your paraloft key, Captain?

34:35.635 --> 34:37.426
Corporal Ramsey must have lifted.

34:37.512 --> 34:40.547
Sergeant Fuentes' key
long enough to make a duplicate.

34:40.849 --> 34:43.054
Corporal Ramsey made
a key to the paraloft?

34:43.143 --> 34:46.060
It's the only way he could have
slipped in to sabotage the chutes.

34:46.146 --> 34:47.639
Thank you, Captain.

34:48.690 --> 34:50.266
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:51.900 --> 34:54.226
Why didn't you just ask to see my key?

34:56.156 --> 34:59.489
Agent Todd is new.
Just teaching her how to interrogate.

34:59.826 --> 35:03.242
The paraloft was secured
between 0900 and 1800.

35:04.581 --> 35:06.787
That's why you wanted to know
what I was doing all day.

35:06.875 --> 35:08.203
You suspected me.

35:08.585 --> 35:10.458
If the captain were a suspect

35:10.545 --> 35:13.250
we would have read him
his rights, wouldn't we?

35:13.423 --> 35:15.462
Very good, Agent Todd. Great.

35:25.977 --> 35:27.602
Captain have an alibi?

35:27.937 --> 35:30.808
He was nowhere near the paraloft
when the chutes were sabotaged.

35:30.899 --> 35:34.564
- Ramsey's the dirt bag.
- Could still be Dafelmair or Brinkman.

35:34.652 --> 35:37.902
Sergeant Fuentes supervised
the riggers handing out chutes?

35:38.031 --> 35:41.150
Yeah, he watches his riggers
from the back of the truck.

35:41.993 --> 35:43.784
Corporal Ramsey participated.

35:43.870 --> 35:47.784
Well, he's on suspension from rigging,
not passing out chutes or jumping.

35:47.999 --> 35:50.870
He could have given Thumper
a dirty chute.

35:51.753 --> 35:53.081
What'd you say?

35:53.171 --> 35:55.840
Ramsey could have given
Thumper a sabotaged chute.

35:55.924 --> 35:57.466
No, you said "dirty".

35:59.886 --> 36:03.053
- What?
- With Gibbs you never know.

36:03.723 --> 36:05.965
Abby, I need to see
Sergeant Fuentes' reserve chute.

36:06.059 --> 36:08.051
You might wanna
take a look at this first.

36:08.144 --> 36:10.351
Now that I'm only running
one DNA analysis,

36:10.438 --> 36:13.143
I finally had time
to do a particle pick on the shroud lines.

36:13.233 --> 36:15.640
You're looking at infrared
of Bolivia's best.

36:15.735 --> 36:17.775
- Cocaine?
- Our killer's using it?

36:17.862 --> 36:19.238
No, the rock's too pure.

36:19.322 --> 36:22.358
The residue on his skin
is probably from cutting and weighing.

36:22.450 --> 36:25.819
Why don't I think Thumper was killed for
reporting Corporal Ramsey's rigging?

36:25.912 --> 36:28.699
- Where's Thumper's reserve chute?
- It's over here.

36:32.585 --> 36:34.993
I already checked it, Gibbs. It's clean.

36:40.009 --> 36:42.002
You know what, it's too clean.

36:42.679 --> 36:46.012
It's too clean for someone who
smashed through a tree and an SUV.

36:46.099 --> 36:48.175
Where's the other jump gear
we confiscated?

36:48.268 --> 36:51.185
I stored it in the ballistics lab
after I tested it.

36:53.439 --> 36:55.064
What are you looking for?

36:55.149 --> 36:59.313
Ramsey, Dafelmair's
and Brinkman's gear. Here's one.

37:01.531 --> 37:04.366
- What are you looking for?
- A screwed pooch.

37:21.884 --> 37:23.628
There it is. It's dirty.

37:25.221 --> 37:27.546
This is the reserve
that Thumper jumped with.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.300
Unlucky 13.

37:30.602 --> 37:33.306
Someone pulled a switch
after he hit the SUV.

37:39.235 --> 37:41.691
The cone's been soldered in place.

37:42.280 --> 37:45.316
Doesn't matter if those painkillers
slowed his judgement.

37:45.408 --> 37:47.199
He couldn't use this chute.

37:47.744 --> 37:49.368
Whose rucksack is this?

37:55.835 --> 37:59.121
Call Captain Faul.
Tell him jump ops can resume.

37:59.213 --> 38:01.289
- We got our killer.
- Do I tell him who?

38:01.382 --> 38:02.461
No.

38:02.842 --> 38:07.136
I don't want DNA evidence.
I want this bastard to confess.

38:08.931 --> 38:11.802
- How are we gonna do that?
- Wear this when we jump.

38:12.560 --> 38:13.935
Jump?

38:23.738 --> 38:24.901
Hey, Cap.

38:25.823 --> 38:27.899
Aren't you a little old to re-up?

38:28.576 --> 38:30.403
I hear there's a war on.

38:31.746 --> 38:36.574
Agent DiNozzo, can't tell if
you're enlisting or just listing.

38:36.668 --> 38:38.245
That's a good one.

38:38.336 --> 38:41.919
We're going with you boys.
NCIS training mission.

38:43.841 --> 38:45.751
Now why don't I believe that?

38:46.761 --> 38:48.837
Hell, why not?

38:49.138 --> 38:50.467
Hate to pass up the opportunity

38:50.556 --> 38:53.427
to toss a couple of NCIS agents
out of a plane.

39:01.609 --> 39:05.358
- Why are you jumping with us, sir?
- I always wanted to jump.

39:05.697 --> 39:07.654
Agent Gibbs came along to laugh.

39:07.740 --> 39:11.738
Hard to believe Dave killed Thumper
over a lousy two weeks' suspension, sir.

39:11.828 --> 39:14.116
- Yeah.
- Thumper rode him, sir,

39:14.789 --> 39:17.790
but no more than the rest of us.
It just doesn't make sense.

39:17.875 --> 39:21.291
- Oh, no!
- What? Chickening out?

39:22.380 --> 39:26.709
13. It's my first jump,
and my reserve is number 13.

39:27.093 --> 39:29.798
Wouldn't have
bothered Thumper, would it, guys?

39:32.348 --> 39:35.384
- Either of you superstitious?
- No, sir.

39:35.476 --> 39:39.225
Great! Why don't you swap
with Corporal Brinkman?

39:39.313 --> 39:42.433
- What's your reserve chute number?
- Four.

39:42.525 --> 39:45.811
Four? No, four is unlucky in China.

39:45.987 --> 39:49.153
- We're not in China.
- I don't care.

39:49.365 --> 39:51.737
- What's your number?
- Eight.

39:52.076 --> 39:54.698
Great! Eight's lucky in China.

39:59.250 --> 40:00.709
Is there a problem?

40:02.378 --> 40:03.541
No, sir.

40:07.341 --> 40:09.168
Stand up!

40:16.058 --> 40:17.173
Hook up.

40:22.023 --> 40:24.858
Thumper ride you, Corporal Dafelmair?

40:25.193 --> 40:29.653
- He rode everybody, sir.
- About being a drug dealer?

40:31.491 --> 40:33.816
That's his reserve chute you're wearing,

40:33.910 --> 40:36.365
the one you switched
on him when he landed.

40:38.873 --> 40:40.616
Don't know what
you're talking about, sir.

40:40.708 --> 40:44.042
You were the first one down.
First one to get to Thumper.

40:44.128 --> 40:46.335
Ramsey was helping Brinkman
out of a tree.

40:46.422 --> 40:48.462
- What's he saying, Paul?
- I don't know.

40:48.549 --> 40:52.214
Only takes a couple of minutes
to switch a bad chute for a good one.

40:53.304 --> 40:55.712
Marine Corps gave you
a second chance.

40:56.557 --> 40:58.911
When Thumper found out
you soiled the uniform by dealing drugs,

40:58.935 --> 41:00.014
he wouldn't do it.

41:00.102 --> 41:03.103
- I thought Corporal Ramsey was guilty?
- He is, sir!

41:06.651 --> 41:08.477
You thought wrong, Corporal.

41:09.195 --> 41:10.440
Prove it.

41:11.113 --> 41:13.984
What the hell are you doing?
His main can't open!

41:14.075 --> 41:15.189
He's got a reserve!

41:15.284 --> 41:18.404
Captain, this is nuts.
You going to put a stop to this, sir?

41:23.000 --> 41:25.040
Thirty seconds to drop.

41:26.212 --> 41:29.912
A confession and ratting out
your drug supplier will get you a deal.

41:36.722 --> 41:40.554
- How good a deal?
- Read him his Article 31s.

41:40.643 --> 41:43.644
- You have the right to remain silent.
- He doesn't deserve a deal!

41:43.729 --> 41:47.679
- Hey, back off!
- Come on. Cool it, man!

41:55.700 --> 41:57.858
Goodbye, DiNozzo.

42:01.873 --> 42:05.407
Military authorities arrested a Marine
and charged him with murder

42:05.501 --> 42:07.410
in connection
with Sergeant Larry Fuentes'

42:07.503 --> 42:09.911
tragic parachute mishap three days ago.

42:10.006 --> 42:13.090
- Corporal Paul Dafelmair based in...
- We ever gonna make the 11:00 news?

42:13.175 --> 42:15.382
Could have happened tonight
if you'd broke your neck.

42:15.469 --> 42:17.129
And is reportedly cooperating

42:17.221 --> 42:19.032
with authorities
in an ongoing drug investigation.

42:19.056 --> 42:20.254
Well, it's been a long one.

42:20.349 --> 42:22.494
Details of the investigation
are being kept under wraps.

42:22.518 --> 42:24.143
You leaving soon?

42:27.398 --> 42:30.434
All right. Good night.

42:32.612 --> 42:34.937
Dafelmair's family would not comment...

43:08.648 --> 43:09.928
Can I come up?

43:12.401 --> 43:14.145
You got a password?

43:14.487 --> 43:17.322
Yes, sir. Semper Fi.

43:20.034 --> 43:22.869
That's a good password. Come on up.

43:31.337 --> 43:32.617
All right.
