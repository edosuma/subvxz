"Add all wet food
disposer, please."

00:44.330 --> 00:48.170
"It is difficult for the
smell of rotting food."

00:51.370 --> 00:54.770
"Do not be bitten twice
by the same dog."

00:59.410 --> 01:02.810
"What have you done
with my sunglasses?"

02:47.530 --> 02:50.770
Okay, everyone. Then we start up.
Add your bags to the side.

02:53.010 --> 02:57.370
I know that you all wake up on the morning
and brush your teeth... hopefully.

02:57.450 --> 03:02.050
You drink coffee and smoke a cigarette.
You put on your dancing clothes...

03:03.770 --> 03:07.770
... and you will audition...
You go to work.

03:10.130 --> 03:12.810
But what is it that makes
you get a job today?

03:15.410 --> 03:17.650
What do today to more than one job

03:17.770 --> 03:21.810
And more than just a loop of
your silly little dance life?

03:22.850 --> 03:25.530
Five, six, seven, eight!

03:25.610 --> 03:30.530
One and two, three and four.
And five and six, seven, and that...

04:03.690 --> 04:06.330
ATHENA, how long have
you tryout for me?

04:09.170 --> 04:11.970
-Six year.
-Six years?

04:12.010 --> 04:14.290
I'm going to ask you one last time...

04:14.410 --> 04:17.810
How much do you want this?

04:17.890 --> 04:20.089
-Max, you know...
-Shut up!

04:20.209 --> 04:23.050
More than your family?

04:23.130 --> 04:27.130
-Yes.
-More than your friends?

04:27.210 --> 04:33.330
-What friends?
-Okay. You can go.

04:35.930 --> 04:38.010
Strangle me.

04:40.730 --> 04:42.610
Harder.

04:44.090 --> 04:47.890
-As if you rape me.
What?

04:48.010 --> 04:50.410
I like tough.

04:52.530 --> 04:55.170
Harder!

04:55.210 --> 04:58.050
Oh my God!
Oh my God, here I come!

05:02.130 --> 05:05.330
Oh, god...

05:05.410 --> 05:08.450
I think I'm still drunk.

05:10.770 --> 05:15.250
I'm usually good at
remembering names...

05:15.330 --> 05:18.530
-Bryan.
-Bryan...

05:20.490 --> 05:25.730
Yes, you, Bry... That was fun.

05:25.810 --> 05:28.490
Yes it was.

05:30.290 --> 05:32.490
Athena...

05:32.570 --> 05:34.450
Give me your hand.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.650
Do not leave me here.

05:41.490 --> 05:45.730
You asked me to rape you?
Did it really?

05:46.770 --> 05:48.650
Why?

05:48.730 --> 05:52.810
It was a long time since I was like this.
It is common nowadays?

05:58.250 --> 06:01.810
Every actress in LA smoke.

06:01.930 --> 06:07.010
-Have you fucked many actresses?
-Maybe it.

06:10.690 --> 06:15.370
But I'm still no actress.
-Not?

06:16.690 --> 06:20.370
The sex is better when the guy
thinks he fucks an actor.

06:20.450 --> 06:24.570
Kindergarten teacher comes
in a close second, but...

06:24.650 --> 06:27.370
... it is not as an actress.

06:27.450 --> 06:31.930
-Dagisfröken is right sexy, actually.
-I'm right sexy.

06:32.010 --> 06:34.890
How long have you been doing it?

06:37.010 --> 06:41.290
Not very long... because I'm not
really a kindergarten teacher.

06:47.770 --> 06:52.330
It appears that your fuck buddy
tries to get hold of you.

06:52.410 --> 06:55.210
Fuck buddy? No, rather boyfriend.

06:57.490 --> 06:59.410
I was joking!

06:59.530 --> 07:03.410
I can not tell if you're
funny, or totally raving mad.

07:03.490 --> 07:07.490
One must have a right peculiar sense
of humor if you think it's funny.

07:10.250 --> 07:13.730
Who is Jack?
-Hörru, we met five minutes ago.

07:13.810 --> 07:16.930
Add to pry into my phone!
Give it to me.

07:17.010 --> 07:18.970
Tell me first who Jack is.

07:19.050 --> 07:23.770
Jack... Jack is my father.
He calls me drunk sometimes.

07:25.370 --> 07:27.450
Prove it.

07:27.530 --> 07:31.210
I do not actually talk to...
with him now.

07:32.370 --> 07:34.890
It's because you're lying.

07:36.450 --> 07:39.770
I just lied about being an actress.

07:39.890 --> 07:44.370
And kindergarten teacher, so...
It does not look great out.

07:45.330 --> 07:50.610
You want me to prove it to you?
Okay, let's see what father Jack has to say.

07:53.450 --> 07:56.650
-Athena...
Okay, I believe you.

07:56.730 --> 08:03.330
It's your... That's dad, King Jack.
The Duke of soul.

08:03.370 --> 08:07.690
I want you to come to Florida
as soon as possible.

08:07.770 --> 08:10.370
I have a great news.

08:10.450 --> 08:15.290
I... have... cancer!

09:10.810 --> 09:14.770
-Honey bunny.
-Have you forgotten me?

09:14.890 --> 09:19.490
How hard I try, I could
never forget you.

09:41.250 --> 09:44.770
Is it just me...
or having your breasts become smaller?

09:46.130 --> 09:48.170
It's just you.

09:48.250 --> 09:51.810
Honey... Athena, come here.

09:53.130 --> 09:55.690
Come then.

10:03.330 --> 10:05.450
I'll take them. It is quiet.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.330
-Pink...
It's been pink for a while now.

10:12.410 --> 10:14.690
You have not visited me for three years.

10:16.130 --> 10:18.650
How's the dancing?

10:21.170 --> 10:25.970
I've heard that all young girls shave
vegetable country nowadays. Is it true?

10:26.050 --> 10:29.770
-Kålungar!
I'm not all the girls, so...

10:29.850 --> 10:31.450
...how should I know?

10:31.530 --> 10:34.130
But you bare down there, right?
-No...

10:34.210 --> 10:36.130
Not?

10:36.210 --> 10:42.690
It is said that one becomes more sensitive
there then, because of... the nerve fibers.

10:43.930 --> 10:47.330
-Nervtrådarna?
Yes, they claim it.

10:47.410 --> 10:50.010
If you want the people to know
that you have a small snorre...

10:50.090 --> 10:52.330
... driving the car!

10:53.330 --> 10:57.290
60 years old, 183 cm, 87 kg.

10:57.370 --> 11:00.530
No family history of
cancer or heart disease.

11:00.610 --> 11:05.570
Nothing at all, except for cataract
surgery in 2008, and high cholesterol.

11:05.650 --> 11:08.730
Did you, Honey Bunny?
In addition to cancer, I'm perfectly healthy.

11:08.810 --> 11:10.690
Watch closely now.

11:10.770 --> 11:15.530
The doctor will see a picture of my father's
lungs and we'll see how the cancer looks like.

11:16.890 --> 11:19.450
Based on CT scan and biopsy

11:19.530 --> 11:24.330
Can we determine that the tumor spreads
from the lungs to the lymph nodes.

11:24.410 --> 11:28.810
-Därefter it can spread to the brain.
What?

11:28.890 --> 11:31.450
Why, record?
Do you think there will be hearings?

11:31.530 --> 11:33.370
We see no signs of brain tumor.

11:33.450 --> 11:37.930
The doctor may be able to suggest a good Indian
restaurant, where we could eat afterwards...

11:38.010 --> 11:41.410
-Please Jack!
She calls me Jack. I'm her father.

11:41.490 --> 11:45.250
Should we try something like Papa Bear?
Should we try to listen to the doctor?

11:48.250 --> 11:54.170
-Okay. What about the lymph nodes?
-Lymfkörtlarna.

11:54.290 --> 11:57.610
You might look better if you
take off your sunglasses.

11:57.690 --> 12:01.050
-How did you know that?
-I do not understand...

12:01.130 --> 12:04.410
We are invisible.
-When he was wearing sunglasses indoors

12:04.490 --> 12:07.010
-must we pretend that he is invisible.

12:07.090 --> 12:11.770
You can not ask him to take off his
glasses, because you can not see him.

12:12.970 --> 12:14.970
Well.

12:15.050 --> 12:20.970
Because I can hear your voice
even though I do not see you-

12:21.050 --> 12:25.490
-must I assume that you wear
your invisible sunglasses...

12:25.570 --> 12:30.410
I want to ask you to take them off, so that
we can discuss treatment for your cancer.

12:34.770 --> 12:39.730
Wow! There you are! Awesome.

13:01.530 --> 13:06.050
It's okay to be scared.
But it is not.

13:08.850 --> 13:13.330
I have my Honey Bunny here.
You are here...

13:13.410 --> 13:16.690
-Jack!
-Don't call me Papa Bear.

13:16.810 --> 13:18.970
I'm serious.

13:19.050 --> 13:23.170
I do not have many left, I do
not want to throw them away.

13:23.250 --> 13:25.690
I love my dad!

13:27.050 --> 13:29.090
He is no dumming!

13:30.890 --> 13:34.130
I love you my princess.

13:34.210 --> 13:38.050
Promise you'll stay with me...
to the end.

13:42.650 --> 13:46.170
Then you promise to do everything
you can to defeat this.

13:46.250 --> 13:50.410
Okay... I switch to ultralight.

13:50.490 --> 13:54.010
No, you must stop completely.

13:54.090 --> 13:56.850
This time for good.

14:07.770 --> 14:11.050
For all nicotine-deprived
children in Africa, right?

14:45.170 --> 14:49.970
-Tjugofyra and thirty.
What? Just to park?

14:50.810 --> 14:54.050
-That's right.
-Behandlar be a brother like that?

14:54.130 --> 14:58.170
I just got the test results on lung
cancer test, which was positive.

14:58.250 --> 15:01.650
I have cancer. They did not solve
the ticket. Can you help me?

15:01.730 --> 15:05.970
-You can not redeem their ticket, so...
-Listen to, Superfly.

15:06.050 --> 15:10.570
I have one to three years to live.
Can not you help me?

15:10.610 --> 15:13.170
Please, Daddy, pay as we get home.

15:13.250 --> 15:15.170
Would you give me $ 25 to park?

15:15.250 --> 15:17.810
-No.
-Knip again, then.

15:17.890 --> 15:20.570
Seriously, what would you do?

15:20.690 --> 15:25.970
If you buy something in the
gift shop, solves the ticket.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.050
Is it true?

15:30.850 --> 15:33.450
I apologize. Thanks for the patience.

15:33.530 --> 15:38.130
Take it easy, buddy!
Sorry, but I have cancer.

15:38.210 --> 15:40.170
Here you are. Thanks brother!

15:45.410 --> 15:49.050
Iron nails too! I forgot to
ask India-doctor, we can eat.

15:49.130 --> 15:51.210
Iron nails too!

16:08.170 --> 16:10.970
-Let's go.
-Not those.

16:11.050 --> 16:14.890
We have not got all day.
-From now on, we eat organic.

16:14.930 --> 16:17.930
I had forgotten how much you
like to spend my money.

16:19.410 --> 16:24.210
A banana! It tastes like a banana.
Come on now.

16:29.890 --> 16:31.610
Now we, Athena!

16:48.890 --> 16:50.970
What is it, honey bunny?

16:51.050 --> 16:54.010
Salad. And my name is
Athena, for the third time.

16:54.090 --> 16:56.570
And I named Honey Bunny,
for the third time.

16:56.690 --> 17:00.290
What will be the main course?
-This is the main course.

17:00.370 --> 17:03.530
I mean, what's for starters?

17:03.610 --> 17:08.890
It is also the starter. It contains
chicken, grilled squash, onions...

17:08.970 --> 17:13.089
...pepper...
Here is everything - radishes, tomatoes...

17:13.170 --> 17:15.290
What's for dessert?

17:18.490 --> 17:21.010
You know what, I have to take this call.

17:26.530 --> 17:30.410
Do you want real food?
Do you want that? Okay.

17:30.490 --> 17:34.330
Dad, do you know where my orange pen is?

17:34.410 --> 17:38.930
How would I know what it is?
-I do not know.

17:39.010 --> 17:42.490
Why do you ask me, then?
-I do not know.

17:49.970 --> 17:54.730
All right, I'll be right back.
But I'm hungry now!

18:00.530 --> 18:04.370
If you do not want salad... here.

18:07.210 --> 18:09.890
Eat this. I will be back soon.

18:14.530 --> 18:18.010
Hi, I have a missed
call from this number.

18:18.090 --> 18:20.490
-Hello.
-Who is it?

18:20.570 --> 18:23.250
It's Bryan.

18:23.330 --> 18:26.210
-Who?
-Bryan.

18:26.290 --> 18:31.370
Sorry, I meet many people,
but I remember no Bryan.

18:31.450 --> 18:36.130
We met the other night. It was I who
heard the message from your dad.

18:38.930 --> 18:43.810
Did you get my number?
-Ringer I inconvenient?

18:45.570 --> 18:49.290
Look, I can not fuck now, I'm
out of town for a while.

18:49.370 --> 18:54.450
I did not call to...
I just wanted to check out how you have it.

18:56.170 --> 19:02.050
I get it. You light to rescue
a damsel in distress, right?

19:02.130 --> 19:05.050
What? No, do not turn me
on that you just said.

19:06.010 --> 19:09.890
I came to think of you and
got the urge to just call.

19:09.970 --> 19:14.050
I had not expected a hearing...
-I must go now.

19:16.890 --> 19:20.810
There, drink this. Big gulps.

19:22.930 --> 19:28.250
-Röker you now? You're only four.
I'm six and a half.

19:28.370 --> 19:32.050
That's right, you're six and a half.
Of course you are.

19:32.170 --> 19:36.570
Say. Believe me, it's not a
good idea to start smoking...

19:43.210 --> 19:45.770
Do not fuck with a hell - DAD

19:45.850 --> 19:49.810
-Stop, Honey Bunny! I'm serious.
You are rotten.

19:49.890 --> 19:52.650
-I'm not at all.
-Yes, the dad.

19:52.730 --> 19:55.690
Daddy do not behave always
as a father should.

19:55.770 --> 19:57.690
That he does.

19:57.770 --> 20:01.290
Do not you see it, you have definitely
been drinking the Kool-Aid.

20:01.370 --> 20:06.410
-Kool-Aid is colored.
Peak, he makes you a racist too.

20:06.490 --> 20:08.490
To what?

20:08.570 --> 20:13.050
Listen. Dad has his world, but
there is a real world, too.

20:14.090 --> 20:18.570
-Is LA the real world?
-Turn around.

21:52.890 --> 21:55.370
What are you doing?

21:56.650 --> 21:59.890
-Dricker Baileys over three ice cubes.
-Why?

22:00.010 --> 22:06.090
It was recommended on the bottle back.
Why are you still awake?

22:06.170 --> 22:09.650
I want to listen to you.
No, the old woman. Go back to bed.

22:09.730 --> 22:12.690
-But I do not want to...
-Seså, go to bed.

22:12.770 --> 22:16.690
-But I do not want to.
Tell him: "Good night, moon."

22:16.770 --> 22:20.290
But I do not want to go to bed!

22:20.370 --> 22:22.610
I count to three.

22:22.690 --> 22:26.130
One two...

22:26.210 --> 22:28.810
Good night, kitty. Good night, miss.

22:30.210 --> 22:32.330
Say goodnight to the boys.

22:33.730 --> 22:39.050
Good night, Miles. Good night, BB.
Good night, Coltrane.

22:39.130 --> 22:41.570
Good girl. Good night, my princess.

22:46.570 --> 22:48.650
Anyone who knows STRONGEST WINS
- PAPA BEAR

22:48.730 --> 22:50.810
REMEMBER ALAMO - PAPA BEAR

22:58.570 --> 23:00.970
HOSPITAL

23:01.050 --> 23:05.290
You can expect a lot of things, such
as lack of appetite, orkeslöshet-

23:05.370 --> 23:09.930
-håravfall, constipation, dry
mouth, difficulty swallowing.

23:10.010 --> 23:13.410
It is important that he
rests when he needs it.

23:13.450 --> 23:16.610
Here is a brochure from the lung
cancer patients' associations.

23:16.690 --> 23:19.850
-Thanks.
-Do you have any other questions?

23:19.930 --> 23:24.010
Yes, for how long underway
the first chemotherapy?

23:24.050 --> 23:28.730
In the six weeks. He was treated on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays for five hours.

23:28.810 --> 23:33.170
Then we see if the cancer has spread
and if he needs six weeks to.

23:33.250 --> 23:35.650
I have a proclamation to all.

23:35.730 --> 23:39.090
I have officially stopped smoking.

23:39.170 --> 23:43.010
We can probably all agree that it
is a step in the right direction.

23:43.090 --> 23:49.010
-Have you noticed any changes?
-Yes actually. Bange.

23:49.090 --> 23:53.930
As soon as I wake up... tough.

23:54.010 --> 23:56.890
It has not happened in years.
Why is that?

23:56.970 --> 24:02.050
-Blodtillförseln increases...
Wait, I have another question.

24:03.490 --> 24:07.490
May I handikapparkera
now that I have cancer?

24:17.650 --> 24:20.570
-I do not want to hear.
I have not said anything.

24:20.650 --> 24:23.530
I know what you're thinking.
-No...

24:23.570 --> 24:26.930
-She is here.
-Who then?

24:27.010 --> 24:29.130
I have not cooked so much food.

24:30.890 --> 24:33.010
Hey!

24:33.090 --> 24:37.330
Athena, this is Midas.
Seashell, this is my daughter Athena.

24:37.450 --> 24:40.770
Hey, Athena.
-Seashell?

24:40.810 --> 24:44.970
It really pronounced Say-chel, but
Jacky can call me whatever he wants.

24:46.290 --> 24:48.410
-Jacky?
Yes, Jacky...

24:55.410 --> 24:58.370
You pay therefore remains for
women to have sex with you?

24:58.450 --> 25:02.530
I do not pay women to have sex
with me, I pay them to go.

25:02.610 --> 25:07.610
I could die at any time. Would you
deprive me one last moment with Amazon?

25:07.690 --> 25:11.530
-What shit boot you are.
Do not be so prudish.

25:11.570 --> 25:13.730
Marriage is just a socially
accepted form of prostitution.

25:13.810 --> 25:16.170
Prostitution is illegal!

25:16.250 --> 25:19.770
Upon marrying the man promises to support
the woman and her promise to fuck him.

25:19.850 --> 25:22.650
The problems begin when she
did not keep their promise.

25:22.730 --> 25:25.570
-Here, I can not open it.
-What is it?

25:25.650 --> 25:30.450
Seriously, hey?
- "Hey"? Do not call me that.

25:30.530 --> 25:33.410
Call me anything like
their dad or Papa Bear.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.810
You can not even open the cover.
Is it really a good idea?

25:36.890 --> 25:40.570
The hand is malfunctioning, it has
nothing to do with cancer to do.

25:40.650 --> 25:44.170
I have not lost a single hair.
It's been a week.

25:44.250 --> 25:46.330
And everyone does not lose
her hair to chemotherapy.

25:46.410 --> 25:50.250
There is one left, I do not like to
throw away. A tablet will not hurt.

25:50.330 --> 25:52.610
Athena...

25:53.810 --> 25:56.770
Think of all the slack of children in Africa.

25:59.810 --> 26:02.250
Come on, help an old man.

26:06.730 --> 26:09.130
Please? Come on.

26:09.170 --> 26:11.130
Come on.

26:11.210 --> 26:14.210
-I hate you.
-No.

26:14.290 --> 26:17.650
-Put it hard?
-Something is in any case hard.

26:17.730 --> 26:21.610
Come here, Seashell. Sit here.
-Tackar.

26:35.610 --> 26:39.250
-What do you do?
I pray, dear children.

26:39.370 --> 26:42.330
My father does not ask, he is an atheist.

26:43.450 --> 26:46.330
Yes, but in the midst of all the world's galenskaper-

26:46.410 --> 26:51.170
-must we remember to be grateful.
-Tacksamhet for what?

26:51.250 --> 26:55.730
I think for example that it is good that
you are here with your father, Athena.

26:56.970 --> 27:00.050
Thanks, Amazon.
What are you thankful for?

27:00.130 --> 27:04.570
I am grateful to the drug companies
that they can create a pill

27:04.650 --> 27:08.210
-As can help an elderly cancer
patient to achieve an erection.

27:08.290 --> 27:10.130
It is enough...

27:10.210 --> 27:14.770
I am grateful to my father teach me
to drive, James Bond and my nails.

27:14.890 --> 27:16.890
And hugs.

27:16.970 --> 27:21.370
Excuse me, Father.
I seem suddenly to have lost my appetite.

27:24.410 --> 27:27.610
Now I know why the alligators
eat their offspring.

28:09.170 --> 28:12.290
-Your bitch!
-Oh my God!

28:16.330 --> 28:19.050
You are the only smaller and smaller.

28:19.130 --> 28:22.770
I've munched paleolithic diet for one year.
-AT hell with the LA-shit.

28:22.850 --> 28:25.730
I go on Snickers diet.
It shines on you.

28:25.810 --> 28:30.250
Thanks, Theena.
Come and sit down.

28:34.770 --> 28:37.450
So, what about the dance?

28:37.530 --> 28:42.810
It... I do not know, I do
not want to tempt fate.

28:42.890 --> 28:46.570
Do you want a beer or some wine?
The wine is pretty good here.

28:49.570 --> 28:53.610
What are you doing at home?
I'm just visiting.

28:53.690 --> 28:56.970
What are you doing here... together?

28:57.050 --> 29:02.610
Nat has not told you?
I'm her "plus one" now.

29:09.370 --> 29:13.050
Nat, you need to go to the bathroom?
I need to go.

29:14.010 --> 29:16.370
We would take with you if we could.

29:16.450 --> 29:20.010
It is the only place you can
not invite his "plus one" to.

29:25.810 --> 29:30.730
-Stop it! Everything is not about you.
What happened to the guy you're dating...

29:30.770 --> 29:35.570
Damn, what was his name? That Mike...
What happened to him?

29:35.650 --> 29:40.890
First, his name was Mitch And if you
really want to know... he was a Jew.

29:40.970 --> 29:44.090
-And?
-Missförstå me wrong, I love Jews.

29:44.170 --> 29:47.210
But Mitch... was very jew.

29:47.290 --> 29:51.170
He said that we could only get
married if I konverterade-

29:51.250 --> 29:55.130
And it was something with it...
that did not feel right to me.

29:55.250 --> 30:00.410
And the only non-Jew you found
happened to be my old boyfriend?

30:00.490 --> 30:06.010
Your boyfriend? Now you're confused.
There you understand well?

30:06.090 --> 30:09.050
He liked you for about a
minute when we were 17th

30:09.130 --> 30:13.930
And be honest, it was you
who broke up with him.

30:14.010 --> 30:18.850
You have not called
or emailed in ages.

30:18.930 --> 30:23.930
So long that this was able to
happen unless you have had a clue.

30:24.050 --> 30:28.050
What do you do at home?
Can you give me the toilet paper, please?

30:28.130 --> 30:30.610
Not until you tell me what you do at home.

30:36.810 --> 30:40.610
Does he make you happy?
Are you happy with Wes?

30:42.090 --> 30:45.610
Yes Yes.

30:48.050 --> 30:50.730
I'm sorry. I really am.

30:53.850 --> 30:57.770
If I thought you cared,
I would have told you.

31:00.050 --> 31:02.770
You thought surely invite me to the wedding?

31:02.850 --> 31:05.850
-Will you at the wedding, then?
-Yes I do.

31:05.930 --> 31:08.290
Please, give me the toilet paper.

31:10.010 --> 31:12.130
Hell, are you all right?

31:18.810 --> 31:21.730
You're pregnant...
But Wes knows nothing.

31:21.810 --> 31:25.650
I can not tell it until the third
month, otherwise he becomes totally...

31:25.730 --> 31:30.250
And his mother!
Is that the same guy that makes you "happy"?

31:31.210 --> 31:33.890
Okay, enough is enough.
Tell me why you're here.

31:35.530 --> 31:37.330
Tell me now.

31:37.930 --> 31:40.170
I dont hear anything!

31:45.370 --> 31:48.530
My dad has cancer.

31:49.570 --> 31:51.890
Oh my God!

32:14.730 --> 32:18.730
If anyone asks, just say
that your mother is dead.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.410
That's why you do not have someone's mother.

32:21.490 --> 32:25.850
But that's okay, because you
have the world's best dad.

32:25.970 --> 32:29.210
So Mom is in heaven?

32:32.450 --> 32:36.090
That the sky is just
bullshit, believe me.

32:36.170 --> 32:39.250
Some very smart people
invented himlen-

32:39.370 --> 32:42.690
-to sell cream cheese and toilet paper.

32:43.690 --> 32:48.810
What happens when you die?
I do not die.

32:48.890 --> 32:53.370
Do not you see? I'm here.

32:53.450 --> 32:57.330
I'm going nowhere.
I will not be me.

32:59.450 --> 33:02.810
Dad, have you found my orange pen yet?

33:06.010 --> 33:10.850
Come, my daughter, let me share with
you some words of wisdom. Okay?

33:13.370 --> 33:17.810
Sometimes you lose things in life.

33:17.890 --> 33:22.330
For example you have
lost your orange pen.

33:22.410 --> 33:29.130
Your cute little peanut brains do not
think that you really have lost it-

33:29.210 --> 33:31.530
-without just that you can not find it.

33:31.610 --> 33:35.530
And that's why you continue
to ask your dad about it.

33:35.610 --> 33:42.090
But it is very likely...
you never get to see that pencil again.

33:43.530 --> 33:46.010
It's gone.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.610
Do you understand?

34:09.010 --> 34:11.650
Athena!

34:23.170 --> 34:26.409
I have been at Costco and
then a delikatessbutik-

34:26.449 --> 34:31.489
-and bought a pastrami sandwich
for you, as I have here...

34:31.570 --> 34:35.850
I was at Bed Bath & Beyond and
then on a wonderful thrift store.

34:35.929 --> 34:38.889
And... Look here.

34:39.850 --> 34:42.810
There is a pillow on one side and...
a desk on the other.

34:44.610 --> 34:46.810
- Unbelievable, huh?
-Yeah, incredible.

34:46.889 --> 34:49.810
Wait until you see this.
It is the very best.

34:49.929 --> 34:53.050
Pièce de résistance,
or what it's called.

34:56.889 --> 34:59.330
A hotplate. Surely it's superb?

34:59.410 --> 35:02.730
Now you can cook for us.
No more salads, or not as many.

35:02.810 --> 35:07.250
What's wrong with the stove?
The reporter said I needed a new one.

35:07.330 --> 35:13.130
Such types always try to blow one, so i
bought this instead. Just check out.

35:14.690 --> 35:16.850
-So good as new.
-So good as new!

35:16.930 --> 35:21.250
-Hear, no more vitamins.
But they are useful!

35:23.530 --> 35:26.770
"What are you, Dad? What have you bought?"
Fun that you ask.

35:26.850 --> 35:31.370
I have purchased dumbbells to
realize my lifelong dream of...

35:31.450 --> 35:34.530
... to become a weightlifting...

35:50.490 --> 35:53.570
Yes, I bought the pasta pasta for you.

36:00.490 --> 36:03.850
-What animal am I?
-I do not know. Fish?

36:03.930 --> 36:06.050
What kind of fish?

36:10.010 --> 36:13.130
-He, Max.
-What kind of fish are I?

36:13.210 --> 36:17.930
No, I'm alone here.
You have my full attention.

36:20.250 --> 36:24.410
Va? Did I move on to the next withdrawal?

36:27.770 --> 36:33.370
Well, the next selection is the last one.
That sounds really good.

36:34.770 --> 36:36.930
So soon?

36:36.970 --> 36:42.170
No, no, it's... no problem.
It is certain.

36:44.050 --> 36:47.930
All right, see you in two weeks.
-Who then?

36:53.290 --> 36:55.690
Dad, then?

36:58.010 --> 37:00.010
Damn it.

37:02.530 --> 37:09.330
I do not know what to do.
I've worked so hard for this tour.

37:10.370 --> 37:12.810
Yes, but this is true for your father.

37:16.730 --> 37:22.210
I wonder why dad even got me.
He was hardly ready to be a father.

37:22.290 --> 37:27.690
-Where we have it. Do you see?
-It's the size of a grape.

37:27.810 --> 37:31.490
Have you noticed that our culture never
celebrate the death and divorce?

37:31.570 --> 37:35.610
Excuse me, this is not about
you, but for me and my baby.

37:35.690 --> 37:38.130
Look, Aunt Athena. I have a grape!

37:39.570 --> 37:44.290
Yeah, look...
You can not see it, right?

37:44.370 --> 37:50.730
You know, I never see anything
in the Magic Eye images either.

37:52.530 --> 37:55.570
If you do not want to sacrifice
your life, why did you come back?

37:55.650 --> 38:01.370
Because he asked me to do it.
Because he's your father.

38:06.410 --> 38:08.570
Come now. Hey.

38:08.690 --> 38:11.690
Hey. Come on, it's time to go now.

38:14.530 --> 38:17.610
-What time is it?
It's time to go, dad.

38:21.130 --> 38:26.570
You would be here at. 13. Where were you?
-Förlåt, but I'm here now.

38:26.650 --> 38:30.330
-Besvara question!
-Calm down.

38:30.410 --> 38:33.890
-Are you okay?
-I feel fine!

38:33.970 --> 38:36.210
Where the hell have you been?

38:38.970 --> 38:42.970
-I posed a question. Where have you been?
What would you have me say?

38:43.050 --> 38:45.250
Why were you late?

38:45.330 --> 38:48.850
The parking lot was full of idiots.
It is thenceforth good response?

38:48.970 --> 38:52.290
You are always late,
except for your damn arm!

38:52.330 --> 38:55.770
Oh my God! Why do you make
me feel crappy over trifles?

38:55.850 --> 39:00.210
I was ten minutes ago. Who the hell cares?
I dropped everything to help you.

39:00.290 --> 39:03.890
Would I make you feel crappy?
It can be only you themselves do!

39:03.970 --> 39:06.330
-Give me the keys. I drive!
Is that a good idea?

39:06.410 --> 39:09.930
I tell you what to do.
I'm the boss, you're hired!

39:10.010 --> 39:13.810
From now you call me 'boss'!
Give me the keys!

39:13.930 --> 39:16.890
You are a stupid little girl
who does not know anything!

39:16.970 --> 39:20.450
You can not run, do not come on
time, did not find parkeringsplats-

39:20.530 --> 39:24.210
And you'll be damned can not dance,
because then you'd have a job now!

39:25.490 --> 39:30.410
I got the hell chemotherapy!
In five freaking hours!

39:33.730 --> 39:36.890
Do not tell me how I should
live my fucking life.

40:15.850 --> 40:20.250
Dad! Dad...

40:20.330 --> 40:23.490
What? What's the matter?

40:24.890 --> 40:27.930
-What is it?
-Tandfen not like me.

40:28.010 --> 40:29.290
What?

40:29.330 --> 40:33.530
I lost a tooth and put
it under your pillow.

40:33.650 --> 40:35.850
Wait a minute.

40:35.930 --> 40:39.050
Have you lost a tooth?
Why did not you tell it?

40:39.130 --> 40:41.410
Why did not the tooth fairy me money?

40:44.210 --> 40:48.370
She might have had time off last night.
-No.

40:48.450 --> 40:52.170
Perhaps it was the many kids who
lost teeth yesterday and...

40:52.250 --> 40:56.130
... she could simply not
around to all the houses.

40:56.170 --> 41:00.650
But you said that when you lose a
tooth, you put it under kudden-

41:00.730 --> 41:04.730
And the tooth fairy will take it and give
it to the kids who do not have teeth yet.

41:06.810 --> 41:09.250
Yes, I said.

41:11.690 --> 41:15.250
Okay, I'll be honest with you.

41:18.410 --> 41:23.410
... Every time a child puts
a tooth under the pillow...

41:24.490 --> 41:31.210
... then the mother or father during the
night and replace the tooth for cash.

41:31.290 --> 41:33.490
What?

41:34.450 --> 41:39.930
Do you remember the Wizard of Oz was
actually a man behind the curtain?

41:40.010 --> 41:42.210
I have not seen it.

41:42.250 --> 41:45.330
We have never seen the Wizard of Oz?
Well... Does not it?

41:47.090 --> 41:51.250
I'm beginning to lose traction.
But you have seen 007 looks red.

41:51.370 --> 41:56.730
Tatiana Romanova meet James in Istanbul
for the return of Lecturer to England-

41:56.810 --> 42:00.490
But instead, it turns out that
the whole thing is a trap.

42:00.570 --> 42:07.370
That's how it is. The Tooth Fairy, life... marriage.

42:09.050 --> 42:15.410
It is believed that there is a way, but then
you realize that it is completely different.

42:16.650 --> 42:19.690
Do you understand what I mean? The...

42:19.770 --> 42:22.010
If you do that or not?

42:23.610 --> 42:26.410
I know something that you will understand.

42:33.130 --> 42:36.290
I do not know how many
teeth you have lost.

42:38.330 --> 42:40.770
This...

42:44.930 --> 42:46.850
... it should cover everyone.

42:52.690 --> 42:54.890
Romance is a pine that
stifle those who struggle...

42:54.970 --> 42:57.050
I'll live a lush life in a SMALL DEN
- FAR

44:37.930 --> 44:42.170
Can not rule that does not call a
girl who is with you directly?

44:42.290 --> 44:45.410
You know what they say about rules?

44:45.490 --> 44:48.210
That you will break them?
-Absolutely.

44:49.170 --> 44:51.490
Well, how are you?

44:53.290 --> 44:55.370
I feel just fine.

44:55.450 --> 44:58.050
How's your dad?

45:00.650 --> 45:04.050
He is still the same.
-Good. Good.

45:05.050 --> 45:10.530
-Yes...
I just wanted to say...

45:10.570 --> 45:16.330
... I'm always here...
If you want to talk or just... you know.

45:17.650 --> 45:19.690
When I'm here for you.

45:21.810 --> 45:24.650
Hey, Bryan, I have to stop now.

45:30.930 --> 45:34.370
You... you see the moon?

45:38.490 --> 45:41.290
Yes, I see it.

45:41.370 --> 45:45.970
You see halos?
No, no halo.

45:47.730 --> 45:52.330
I have always found it funny that two
people can look at the same HEAVEN

45:52.410 --> 45:55.930
-and still see two different
versions of the same thing.

46:00.410 --> 46:02.610
You, Bryan?
-Yes.

46:05.610 --> 46:07.970
Thanks for calling.

46:08.050 --> 46:11.610
You, Athena...

46:11.690 --> 46:17.010
-...hold on.
-Okay. Good night.

46:48.490 --> 46:51.690
I'm here to pick up my
father, Jack Morehead.

46:54.130 --> 46:56.530
Can you spell the last name, please?

46:58.050 --> 47:01.650
M-O-R-E-H-E-A-D.

47:15.450 --> 47:20.370
Dr. Halper, please come to
the reception desk, please.

47:20.450 --> 47:24.890
Dr. Halper to the reception, please.

47:31.650 --> 47:34.210
The doctor will in a minute.

47:51.650 --> 47:57.450
Hello! What do you mean allergic reaction?
The treatment is supposed to make him better.

47:57.530 --> 48:00.490
Some people get worse before they get better.

48:00.530 --> 48:03.250
Chemotherapy is a
shock to the body.

48:03.330 --> 48:07.090
-The shock handled very differently.
How he handled it?

48:07.170 --> 48:12.530
Not good. He was confused, very
irritable and started swearing...

48:12.610 --> 48:14.890
That's how he's always!

48:14.970 --> 48:19.730
He pulled out the needle and held it
against a nurse's neck. Does he do so?

48:21.730 --> 48:25.770
We gave him a sedative and then
decreased blood pressure significantly.

48:25.850 --> 48:29.890
We want to take some tests to be sure
that everything is as it should.

48:31.570 --> 48:36.330
Believe me, he's back home
in two days, maybe three.

48:36.410 --> 48:39.850
Believe me, you want him out after two.

49:09.970 --> 49:13.450
Shall the bill be paid or be kept open?
-Keep it open.

49:50.890 --> 49:54.810
-Is this seat taken?
No, go ahead.

49:56.490 --> 50:00.810
I've never been very
good at playing cool-

50:00.890 --> 50:04.130
-so I go straight to the point
and tell you why I'm here.

50:04.210 --> 50:06.530
You is not a Jehovah's Witness?

50:09.130 --> 50:11.330
What did you say your name was?

50:11.410 --> 50:17.130
We do not burden us with that silly burden
of trying to remember each other's names.

50:17.210 --> 50:20.890
You will not tell me your name?
I prefer that we go to a motel-

50:20.970 --> 50:23.690
-or a toilet is also
good, and then...

50:23.770 --> 50:27.370
... we say goodbye and
go our separate ways.

50:32.930 --> 50:37.530
If you are not accustomed to seeing
girls like you never talk to again?

50:41.090 --> 50:45.330
I apologize, but I have
probably politely decline.

50:59.250 --> 51:01.330
I have a friend who can fix morphine for you.

51:01.450 --> 51:06.330
He can buy a boat and we can sail around the
world until the pain becomes too severe.

51:06.410 --> 51:11.530
It was not the cancer that meant I
ended up here, without treatment.

51:11.610 --> 51:16.290
The medical profession is a bunch of
scumbags that makes the insurers say.

51:17.170 --> 51:20.250
Give me. No, with this.

51:20.330 --> 51:25.170
-Passa you, you're in the hospital now.
-Smiska me on the ass.

51:26.730 --> 51:31.330
-Look what the cat dragged in!
Hey, Athena.

51:31.410 --> 51:34.330
Hey, Amazon.
I'm not a disability.

51:34.410 --> 51:37.050
Tell me just thank you.
-No.

51:38.010 --> 51:40.690
This is the best part.

51:40.810 --> 51:44.570
-loved spy...
Who plays James Bond in it?

51:44.690 --> 51:49.610
-Stop it. Roger Moore.
Yeah, that was too easy. Everybody knows it.

51:49.690 --> 51:54.690
Who played Agent XXX?
-Barbara...

51:54.730 --> 51:57.650
-Barbara Bach.
-Very good.

51:57.730 --> 52:02.410
But the gun she used?
-Which of them?

52:02.450 --> 52:06.410
In the last scene against James.
What was her gun?

52:06.490 --> 52:13.010
-Oh, it was difficult.
It begins with W...

52:13.090 --> 52:17.890
-Walther PPK.
-Suveränt! My clever girl.

52:17.970 --> 52:21.770
Only girl in the class who
could identify firearms.

52:21.850 --> 52:27.410
I'm dying to eat anything but tasteless
sandwiches and butter like jelly.

52:27.490 --> 52:29.170
Sickening.

52:29.250 --> 52:33.930
Hello there! I actually have cancer.
It will kill me, not you.

52:34.010 --> 52:38.330
If you want the people to know that you
have a small snorre - drive the car! Good.

52:47.690 --> 52:53.650
Dad, I want to talk to you about something.
-"Dad"? Wow, I've been promoted.

52:53.770 --> 52:59.210
Dad, listen... I got a call...
There is one thing I want to talk about...

52:59.290 --> 53:01.370
Wait there.

53:02.850 --> 53:05.610
Wait there!

53:08.570 --> 53:13.810
Jack, I promise to come back.
I promise...

53:13.930 --> 53:17.370
Jack, this is my life...

53:31.210 --> 53:36.010
Dad, can I run?
No, I come from the hospital. I drive.

53:42.130 --> 53:45.730
That said, Dad, there's something
I want to talk to you about...

53:45.810 --> 53:49.810
I just came from the hospital.
Can not it wait?

54:01.490 --> 54:03.610
ADD ALL MOIST FOOD
IN disposer, THANKS

54:03.690 --> 54:05.890
I have a hard smell of rotting food
- CHIEF

54:12.610 --> 54:15.290
DO NOT BITE twice by the same dog
- CHIEF

54:17.570 --> 54:19.850
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH
MY SUNGLASSES ??? CHIEF

54:28.210 --> 54:30.610
Hey, time to take vitamins.

54:34.690 --> 54:37.930
I have so much pain in my
throat, I could not swallow.

54:38.010 --> 54:41.330
You want ice?
-Napp.

54:41.410 --> 54:43.290
What?

54:44.290 --> 54:47.410
I want you to buy a baby in the pharmacy.

54:48.410 --> 54:51.050
-Are you serious?
-Do it.

54:52.690 --> 54:54.970
-Okay.
-Wait.

54:55.690 --> 54:57.610
Have you taken my sunglasses?

55:01.490 --> 55:04.370
-Look here.
-Yeah, thanks.

55:05.770 --> 55:08.450
I do not remember that I put them there.

55:16.330 --> 55:21.370
Excuse me, can I help?
-Yes. I want to buy a baby.

55:21.450 --> 55:25.930
How old is the child?
-60.

55:29.770 --> 55:34.010
Wait, I have to go to the bathroom.
-Yeah.

55:40.450 --> 55:43.970
Let me just be, Athena.
-Okay.

55:58.330 --> 56:00.570
Do not just stand there. Help me up!

56:05.170 --> 56:07.850
Oh my God. Oh my God.

56:08.930 --> 56:11.290
-God, okay...
-Hurry.

56:11.370 --> 56:14.290
No, no, we can not!
That's his favorite pants.

56:14.410 --> 56:18.290
Jack Morehead. He said you
know him and you'd fix it.

56:18.370 --> 56:20.730
Very bad. Do not wash. Must throw.

56:20.810 --> 56:25.970
He sent me here...
-No. It ends up on other customers' clothes.

56:35.530 --> 56:41.970
I do not throw my favorite pants.
You've at least 14 of the same trousers.

56:42.050 --> 56:45.570
-I like them. They are my favorites.
I do not know what to say.

56:45.610 --> 56:47.890
-Wash them by hand.
-Excuse?

56:48.010 --> 56:52.810
It's just some shit.
No, it's actually a lot of crap.

56:52.890 --> 56:58.210
Sorry if I do not want my dad's poop
smells on your hands for a week.

56:58.290 --> 57:01.210
Do you know how often I had
your poo smell on my hands?

57:01.290 --> 57:05.770
When I was a baby?
-Continuously! For years!

57:05.810 --> 57:09.810
-This is a little different.
Do not be so damn fisförnäm.

57:09.890 --> 57:12.210
I raised you better than that!

57:41.570 --> 57:44.290
-What do you want?
-The clock is half past two.

57:44.370 --> 57:47.650
I can not see, smell
or taste of my lunch.

57:47.730 --> 57:54.170
-Betyder the mouth is better?
-kl. 15:00'll be here. Bye.

57:55.210 --> 57:57.770
Yes Boss.

58:34.170 --> 58:38.010
Where are they? Where are they?

58:38.090 --> 58:41.730
I know they're here somewhere.

58:41.770 --> 58:45.130
-Stop! Let them be!
You took the last package from the freezer!

58:45.210 --> 58:47.370
-I did not!
-Do not lie!

58:47.450 --> 58:49.930
-No!
-Do not lie to me!

58:53.210 --> 58:55.170
Do not fuck with a hell - DAD

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:09.730
You came!

01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:13.050
Obvious. You begged.

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:16.490
I begged not.
I know, sorry.

01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:20.250
You had called me and
then asked you casually.

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:27.090
What? What are you doing?

01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:30.970
Oh my God. Okay, should we do this?

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:35.250
Yeah, so do we. Now it's for something.

01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:39.170
-Let's go. How was the flight?
-It was long.

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:41.290
But I'm glad to be here.

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:44.850
I have not had the time... Enjoy.
-Tackar.

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:49.250
I have not had time to clean up,
so do not judge me, please.

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:51.290
I'm not judging you.

01:00:55.210 --> 01:01:00.650
You've been here before,
so feel at home...

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:27.650
I apologize. If you come back I
promise it will be different.

01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:32.170
I'm getting a nurse and I'll be nice.
Whatever you want.

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:39.410
I have quit smoking. Finito!

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:53.010
Honey Bunny... the goddess of wisdom...
I can not die alone.

01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:18.330
Focus! Come on, Athena!

01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:31.170
If you're going to be like this, then
how will it be during the rehearsals?

01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:33.210
Here we go!

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:40.770
Lift!

01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:43.890
Can the caller's phone be
turned off immediately!

01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:55.530
Can all belongings be stored
in the cabinets? Thanks!

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:03.970
I've done some grumpy porridge for you.

01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:08.250
Come on, Dad, I'm back!
It is hot, burn you.

01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:12.010
Dad, I'm here! Jack...

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:16.530
Jack.

01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:21.450
Jack?

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:35.010
Excuse me, it's your...
He is my father.

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:37.370
-Do you have authorization?
-Yes.

01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:40.090
Would you like us to start
the heart if it stops?

01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:44.370
-Excuse?
-Your father breathes with the help of a machine.

01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:47.170
The heart beats on its
own, but it will stay.

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:50.650
-Do you want then we start again?
-Yes.

01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:54.890
To do that, we must push with all
our might and cracking his ribs.

01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:57.290
-Do it then.
-You do not understand...

01:04:57.370 --> 01:05:02.570
No, it is you who do not understand.
Break the ribs if the heart stops.

01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:05.890
Well then.

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:27.450
As you can see in the brochure,
we have a great selection.

01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:39.570
Where you his daughter?
I'm his daughter.

01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:43.970
Yes, of course.
But what I wanted to ask was...

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:48.170
... if he has no wife?

01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:51.970
No, he has never been married.

01:05:52.050 --> 01:05:56.330
But your mother, then?
What's with her?

01:05:57.290 --> 01:06:01.210
Where is she?

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.650
I think she did as
Thelma and the Louise

01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:08.450
-and that her spirit hovering
somewhere over the Grand Canyon.

01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:13.970
No older siblings?

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:20.890
No guardian can help
with all of this?

01:06:20.970 --> 01:06:23.410
I am my own guardian.

01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:28.250
That.

01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:42.650
I can tell you that he took
a job as skrotförsäljare-

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:45.890
-istället to realize his dream
of playing jazz saxophone?

01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:52.970
I could tell that he did
not fight for his life...

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:55.010
... did not take it seriously...

01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:59.930
... and not thought about how his death
would affect those he left behind?

01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:08.450
Or how he paralyzed me
almost all my rela-

01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:10.930
-with someone from the opposite sex?

01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:16.290
I was allowed to tell them the truth?

01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:31.410
"Romance is ensuring that
stifles the fighting."

01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:37.450
"I'll live a lush life
in a little town."

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:43.130
"Anyone who feels the strongest will win."

01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:48.010
"Remember the Alamo."

01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:54.730
"Add all wet food
disposer, please."

01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:58.530
"It is difficult for the
smell of rotting food."

01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:05.530
"Do not be bitten twice
by the same dog."

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:56.170
Nice sunglasses.

01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:02.250
Do you want them?
I do not know what to make of it all.

01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:07.529
You should keep them.
-Yes...

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:11.649
Maybe you can tell me what to
keep and what I get to throw.

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:44.090
Please Theens, I can not.

01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:53.370
Sorry. Forgive me.

01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:56.370
Forgive me too.

01:09:57.450 --> 01:10:01.210
You should come over for
dinner before traveling.

01:10:01.290 --> 01:10:04.690
It would like Nat.

01:10:04.810 --> 01:10:07.210
Certainly.

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:09.610
We are always here for you.

01:10:09.690 --> 01:10:11.690
All three.

01:11:02.850 --> 01:11:06.490
TO MY honeybunny

01:12:18.370 --> 01:12:22.530
You must think that I am a big pig that
do not respond to calls or text messages?

01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:26.730
I can take a hint.
-There is no hint.

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:29.370
I had to return to Florida.

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:33.810
How's your dad?

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:39.490
Damn it. I'm sorry.

01:12:42.730 --> 01:12:44.930
What are you doing on Friday?

01:12:47.170 --> 01:12:51.330
You know, hanging out with
the guys, go clubbing...

01:12:51.370 --> 01:12:54.530
-Nightclub?
-Yes. How about you?

01:12:56.170 --> 01:13:00.370
I come home to you.
-So?

01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:03.730
I have no great hopes.
-I'm serious.

01:13:03.810 --> 01:13:05.930
How about eight?

01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:11.610
I have to check with the guys.
-Of course.

01:13:11.690 --> 01:13:16.450
But eight is good enough.
-Okay.

01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:19.810
Good. Messa your address.

01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:24.010
I'm doing it now.
Or after I have finished my...

01:13:24.090 --> 01:13:28.050
-Absolutely.
I'm on the 6.5 km... I must continue.

01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:51.370
-What's that?
-Bond-marathon.

01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:55.530
-Hörru, how do I look?
-As a slut.

01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:59.450
I'm back for a maximum of two hours. Okay?

01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:08.050
-Varsågod and her, Miss.
-This is not necessary.

01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:13.930
I know, but when invited someone
up on homemade food last?

01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:20.930
I was not sure whether
you eat meat or not-

01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:24.370
-because you actresses
tend to be vegans.

01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:28.610
I'm not an actress.
-I know. It was a joke.

01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:04.650
She looks like you. Your mom.

01:15:10.890 --> 01:15:15.370
Bald unit really emphasizes similarity.

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:41.850
Take it easy, I have
only three bottles.

01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:49.210
Are you going to tell me
what you really working?

01:15:55.610 --> 01:16:01.050
I... am... a stripper.

01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:07.450
Is it OK if we eat first?

01:16:40.570 --> 01:16:44.530
Look, I understand how hard you
have to have it right now.

01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:49.450
-No you do not.
-Yes I do.

01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:55.770
No... Do you think we are alike only
because your mother died of cancer?

01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:58.690
-Is that so?
What?

01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:03.290
Photo. You do not hide the fact
that she received chemotherapy.

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:07.370
Mom did not get chemotherapy,
it was me who got it.

01:17:07.450 --> 01:17:11.450
My family shaved their heads
when I started losing hair.

01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:19.370
You're not the only one in the world
who have suffered from that shit.

01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:28.330
I'm not good at this stuff.
-To eat or talk?

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:34.610
-This. All this!
-I'm just trying to get to know you.

01:17:34.690 --> 01:17:39.610
It is best that I can.
-Stop it. Now överdramatiserar you.

01:17:39.690 --> 01:17:44.090
No. I am unable to play
boyfriend-girlfriend.

01:17:44.170 --> 01:17:45.930
I do not want to do it.

01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:50.570
But two adult people who
talk over a meal, when?

01:17:50.650 --> 01:17:54.730
I did not come for you
to buy me nice dinner-

01:17:54.810 --> 01:17:57.810
-and tell that everyone has cancer.

01:17:57.890 --> 01:18:01.250
You just came to be empty
and meaningless sex.

01:18:03.330 --> 01:18:09.650
What kind of a gay who turn down a
half-naked girl in his living room?

01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:14.330
One who knows that you can
not fuck the pain away.

01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:19.450
Pain? My pain?
You're my fucking shrink now?

01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:23.130
Come on, we both know that you
do not have someone therapist.

01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:25.730
You bastard. What's that?

01:18:25.810 --> 01:18:30.730
A soufflé, as I have
done for dessert.

01:19:09.610 --> 01:19:12.610
It's Jack. You know what to do.

01:19:16.050 --> 01:19:18.290
Dad...

01:19:21.810 --> 01:19:25.530
I just wanted to say that...

01:19:26.530 --> 01:19:30.050
... I'm so terribly sorry.

01:19:30.130 --> 01:19:34.730
I'm so sorry for everything.

01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:42.250
I forgive you.

01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:49.330
I do. I forgive you.

01:19:58.570 --> 01:20:00.730
Dad, this is so difficult...

01:20:11.370 --> 01:20:13.890
I miss you.

01:20:18.970 --> 01:20:21.170
I love you.

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:15.450
Anyone who knows STRONGEST WINS.
- PAPA BEAR

01:22:30.170 --> 01:22:32.410
Pause music. Cancel!

01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:34.370
Athena.

01:22:38.010 --> 01:22:41.170
I'm sorry, Max.
I am really sorry.

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:44.370
Sorry.

01:22:48.810 --> 01:22:50.930
Welcome back.

01:24:23.690 --> 01:24:28.090
Smile! Smile heart. One two Three.

01:24:42.850 --> 01:24:44.770
Do you fix it?

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:53.010
Big smile, Athena. One two Three!

01:25:10.770 --> 01:25:13.370
I love you my princess.

01:25:14.970 --> 01:25:19.090
If you want the people to know that you
have a small snorre - drive the car! Good.

01:25:19.170 --> 01:25:22.570
Honey Bunny... Goddess of Wisdom...

01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:24.810
What is it, honey bunny?

01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:26.570
Look, Honey Bunny?

01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:29.050
Honey... Athena.

01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:48.010
Your orange pen is gone, forever.
It'll never see again.

01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:50.250
But it does not matter.

01:26:10.490 --> 01:26:12.770
TO MY honeybunny

01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:10.170
