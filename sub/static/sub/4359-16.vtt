<i> My sister Annie

 some experiment.</i>

00:55.560 --> 00:57.320
<i> But you know something?</i>

00:57.320 --> 01:00.080
<i> I guess 
 I'm not so average anymore.</i>

Hey, Alex.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.160
Oh, hi.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.320
You having a problem 
 with your locker?

01:12.320 --> 01:13.600
Yeah, it gets jammed.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.840
Oh, here, let me try.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.800
<i>( Bangs it )</i>

01:17.800 --> 01:18.960
Thanks.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.400
What do you have next?

01:20.400 --> 01:21.680
Social studies.

01:21.680 --> 01:24.160
I spent all night 
 working on this paper

01:24.160 --> 01:26.720
on subcultures 
 in western civilization.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.040
Miss Jenkins, 
 huh?

01:28.040 --> 01:30.840
Yeah. I'll be lucky 
 if I can survive

01:30.840 --> 01:31.920
the semester.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.600
<i>( School bell ringing )</i>

01:33.600 --> 01:34.680
I better go.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.200
Talk to you later.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.760
See you.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.560
Well, you two are 
 certainly becoming close.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.320
We were just 
 talking, Kelly.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.120
That's nice.

01:46.120 --> 01:47.160
I wanted to know

01:47.160 --> 01:49.160
if you were free 
 Sunday night.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.760
Me? What for?

01:50.760 --> 01:51.880
What do you think?

01:51.880 --> 01:54.040
My parents wonder 
 if you can baby-sit.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.560
They're willing 
 to forget

01:55.560 --> 01:57.040
the problems 
 last time.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.480
I'd do it, but Scott 
 and I have plans.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.080
Besides...

02:01.080 --> 02:04.280
Aren't you always looking 
 to make a little money?

02:04.280 --> 02:05.360
Sunday I'm busy.

02:05.360 --> 02:06.360
Really?

02:06.360 --> 02:08.360
Well, if you 
 change your mind

02:08.360 --> 02:10.840
let me know.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.000
What's 
 the matter?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.400
I can't find 
 my paper.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.240
I could have sworn 
 I put it in my notebook.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.720
Maybe it's 
 in your bag.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.160
Which is 
 in my locker.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.520
I've got 
 to go back.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.520
Alex, class 
 starts any minute.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.240
Save my seat.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.080
<i>( Zapping )</i>

02:58.240 --> 02:59.160
<i>( Screams )</i>

03:02.880 --> 03:07.440
<i>Atron: 
 Well, is this it?</i>

03:07.440 --> 03:10.280
Yes, Miss Atron.

03:10.280 --> 03:11.800
I see.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.680
It says that 
 although GC-161

03:13.680 --> 03:15.120
has definite potential

03:15.120 --> 03:17.200
regarding genetic 
 restructuring

03:17.200 --> 03:19.440
the results of this 
 research trial

03:19.440 --> 03:22.960
still prove 
 inconclusive?

03:22.960 --> 03:23.960
Mack!

03:23.960 --> 03:27.040
Our company has sunk 
 millions

03:27.040 --> 03:28.320
into GC-161.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.720
This is not 
 a bug spray!

03:30.720 --> 03:33.240
Well, it might help 
 if I knew

03:33.240 --> 03:36.840
the specific application 
 of the substance.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.640
I can't determine 
 the specific application

03:39.640 --> 03:42.840
till I get the results 
 from you.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.520
Look, Mack.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.600
I'm going to be 
 frank with you.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.720
There's a great 
 deal of concern

03:49.720 --> 03:51.560
surrounding 
 the continuation

03:51.560 --> 03:52.720
of this project.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.280
Now, this weekend 
 I'm meeting

03:55.280 --> 03:59.120
with some very 
 important investors.

03:59.120 --> 04:03.080
I need to give them 
 conclusive evidence.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.320
Re-run the tests 
 A.S.A.P.

04:05.320 --> 04:06.400
Ms. Atron...

04:06.400 --> 04:08.160
I want to be a team player.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.160
Good.

04:09.160 --> 04:10.640
<i>( Laughing nervously )</i>

04:10.640 --> 04:12.560
But my wife and I 
 spent months

04:12.560 --> 04:15.480
planning a trip 
 for this weekend.

04:15.480 --> 04:20.320
Oh, that is so sweet.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.600
Too bad you're 
 going to be busy.

04:26.200 --> 04:26.920
This is bad.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.160
I know my parents.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.200
When they hear 
 I have detention

04:30.200 --> 04:31.160
there's no way

04:31.160 --> 04:33.000
they'll let me 
 have a party.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.200
And I've already invited 
 like a million people.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.480
Detention, huh?

04:40.480 --> 04:42.280
I have to 
 admit, Mack

04:42.280 --> 04:45.040
I didn't think 
 you had it in you.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.440
It was 
 an accident.

04:46.440 --> 04:49.240
It's not like I plowed 
 into her on purpose.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.760
I didn't see 
 her coming.

04:50.760 --> 04:51.840
What do 
 you think

04:51.840 --> 04:53.160
your parents 
 will do?

04:53.160 --> 04:54.800
Since they're 
 going to be

04:54.800 --> 04:56.520
out of town 
 for the weekend

04:56.520 --> 04:58.840
I don't see why 
 they have to know.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.480
Welcome to detention, ladies.

05:07.480 --> 05:11.360
I'm sure you both know the 
 reasons why you're here.

05:11.360 --> 05:15.400
If not, you'll have plenty 
 of time to think about them.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.720
Since this is a 
 mandatory study hall

05:17.720 --> 05:20.080
I hope you brought 
 lots of homework.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.840
I'll be in a faculty meeting 
 in the next room

05:22.840 --> 05:25.480
if you need anything.

05:25.480 --> 05:29.800
I wonder what 
 happened to her arm.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.640
It was an accident.

05:31.640 --> 05:32.880
It's not like

05:32.880 --> 05:35.320
I plowed into her 
 on purpose.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.480
Oh. Well.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.840
I was caught in 
 the boys' locker room

05:38.840 --> 05:41.800
trying to steal 
 Coach Rooney's whistle.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.760
The captain of the volleyball 
 team dared me to do it.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.440
She said it proved 
 my team loyalty.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.600
No kidding.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.760
Yep.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.320
Wow, I love 
 your hat.

05:52.320 --> 05:53.760
Is that new?

05:53.760 --> 05:54.520
No.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.080
You know, 
 I was thinking.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.280
About this morning

05:59.280 --> 06:00.720
when I talked to you.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.080
Maybe I was 
 a little...

06:02.080 --> 06:03.200
What's the word?

06:03.200 --> 06:04.560
Rude?

06:04.560 --> 06:07.040
Uh, yeah.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.400
Anyway, I just wanted 
 to apologize.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.440
Fine.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.000
Great.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.240
Thanks.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.840
<i>Mrs. Mack: 
 Busy?!</i>

06:17.840 --> 06:19.360
George, you've 
 dedicated

06:19.360 --> 06:21.760
every waking moment 
 to this project.

06:21.760 --> 06:22.880
Enough is enough!

06:22.880 --> 06:25.040
We are not canceling 
 this trip.

06:25.040 --> 06:25.720
I know.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.200
But if I go now

06:27.200 --> 06:29.240
Danielle will probably take

06:29.240 --> 06:31.240
the GC-161 assignment 
 away from me

06:31.240 --> 06:33.040
if not worse.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.080
You've already done 
 all the tests.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.560
You've done 
 the research.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.680
What does this woman 
 want from you?

06:38.680 --> 06:42.040
She wants me 
 to re-run the tests

06:42.040 --> 06:44.480
to confirm the results.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.280
Well...

06:45.280 --> 06:47.200
Get scooter to do it.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.840
I'm the head of the 
 department, Barbara.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.320
Danielle won't accept

06:52.320 --> 06:54.120
any test results 
 on GC-161

06:54.120 --> 06:56.000
unless I sign off on them.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.720
George, Lava Hot Springs--

06:59.720 --> 07:01.800
it's very beautiful

07:01.800 --> 07:03.160
and relaxing.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.760
And it's very exclusive.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.520
She'll never know 
 you're not at the office.

07:07.520 --> 07:11.240
She has her ways.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.640
Figures.

07:15.640 --> 07:18.280
Annie finally lets me 
 borrow her shirt

07:18.280 --> 07:20.360
and Louis 
 decides to play

07:20.360 --> 07:23.040
spin the ketchup 
 bottle at lunch.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.480
Can you believe this?

07:24.480 --> 07:26.440
So, what's this about Kelly?

07:26.440 --> 07:28.280
After one day of detention

07:28.280 --> 07:30.800
she's trying to be 
 your best friend?

07:30.800 --> 07:32.240
This makes no sense.

07:32.240 --> 07:36.360
This is the same girl who 
 accused you of stealing, Alex.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.840
Look, I'm not 
 saying I trust her.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.320
But I have to admit

07:40.320 --> 07:42.720
she's trying really 
 hard to be nice.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.240
Fine.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.360
Just be careful, 
 all right?

07:56.120 --> 07:57.160
Hey!

07:57.160 --> 07:58.080
Hey.

07:58.080 --> 08:01.520
Oh, rubbing it 
 won't help.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.800
Use cold water.

08:03.800 --> 08:04.600
Here.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.680
Hey, it's coming out.

08:07.680 --> 08:11.760
Yeah, I think 
 it'll be fine.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.600
Kelly, why are you 
 being so nice to me?

08:14.600 --> 08:16.000
Alex, I feel awful

08:16.000 --> 08:19.200
about everything that's 
 happened between us.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.400
I know I haven't 
 made it easy.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.400
Sometimes it's hard being new

08:23.400 --> 08:24.920
trying to fit in.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.560
But now that I've 
 gotten to know you

08:27.560 --> 08:29.160
I want to start all over.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.360
I was hoping

08:30.360 --> 08:33.080
if you're not doing 
 anything tomorrow

08:33.080 --> 08:35.880
that we could hang out 
 or something.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.799
Aren't you doing 
 something with Scott?

08:38.799 --> 08:41.120
No, he has to work 
 all day tomorrow.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.320
Scott and I spend 
 plenty of time together.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.640
It's nice to do 
 something different.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.400
I think you and I would 
 have a lot of fun.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.480
What do you say?

08:50.480 --> 08:52.400
Give me a chance.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.800
We could hang out 
 at my place.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.120
I don't think so.

08:57.120 --> 08:57.960
Please?

09:00.480 --> 09:04.200
Well, if it means 
 that much to you...

09:04.200 --> 09:08.200
Of course, it could be 
 a little uncomfortable.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.000
My parents are still upset 
 about detention.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I'm sure you 
 can relate, right?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.280
Actually, 
 my parents

09:14.280 --> 09:16.080
are going away 
 this weekend.

09:16.080 --> 09:16.960
Hey, perfect!

09:16.960 --> 09:18.200
I'll call tomorrow

09:18.200 --> 09:19.600
to make plans, okay?

09:27.280 --> 09:29.600
Mrs. Mack: This 
 is so great, honey.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.200
I'm so glad 
 we came here.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.480
<i>Mr. Mack ( Muffled ): 
 Yeah, me too.</i>

09:34.480 --> 09:35.320
George?

09:37.320 --> 09:38.440
Barbara, I need

09:38.440 --> 09:40.800
to check in 
 with scooter soon.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.280
Relax.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.000
<i>( Pager beeping )</i>

09:52.000 --> 09:54.800
Don't destroy the house, okay?

09:54.800 --> 09:55.960
Come on, Annie.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.680
I'm just having 
 a friend over

09:57.680 --> 09:58.960
to watch 
 some videos.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.400
Can't you ever 
 trust me?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.000
Besides, when 
 have I ever

10:02.000 --> 10:03.320
destroyed 
 the house?

10:03.320 --> 10:04.760
There's a first time 
 for everything.

10:04.760 --> 10:05.760
Bye.

10:07.520 --> 10:08.680
Hi!

10:08.680 --> 10:09.440
Hi!

10:10.240 --> 10:11.520
You're early.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.200
Come in.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.160
Um, Annie

10:16.160 --> 10:19.560
shouldn't you be 
 leaving now?

10:19.560 --> 10:20.480
Bye, Annie.

10:22.560 --> 10:23.360
Do you mind

10:23.360 --> 10:24.640
if I call home?

10:24.640 --> 10:26.600
I promised my parents 
 I'd call.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.960
Sure. Use the phone 
 in the kitchen.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.240
Thanks!

10:33.520 --> 10:34.360
Hi! Hi!

10:34.360 --> 10:35.560
Hi.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.840
What are you guys doing here?

10:36.840 --> 10:39.320
I told you Kelly 
 was coming over.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.360
Oh, right, well

10:40.360 --> 10:41.680
we were on 
 our way to

10:41.680 --> 10:43.000
the diner. 
 The mall.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.760
The mall. 
 The diner.

10:46.760 --> 10:47.840
Actually

10:47.840 --> 10:50.800
we're still 
 deciding.

10:50.800 --> 10:51.960
Real smooth.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.000
I told you

10:53.000 --> 10:54.960
we should have 
 done the talking.

10:59.360 --> 11:02.160
Well, you see, 
 the truth is...

11:02.160 --> 11:03.360
We don't trust Kelly

11:03.360 --> 11:05.000
and we came to check on you.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.840
Give me a little credit.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.360
You don't have 
 to check up on me.

I can't recognize 
 half of them.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.640
Raymond... 
 allow me.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.760
This is Atron High School's

Hank Grillo, 
 A.K.A. Nothing.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.160
This is Sandy Taylor

11:54.160 --> 11:57.440
captain of the varsity 
 cheerleading team.

11:59.160 --> 12:00.720
And this is Joey Greene.

His dad owns 
 all the used-car dealerships

12:03.520 --> 12:05.120

12:20.640 --> 12:22.720
The next time 
 we go on vacation

12:22.720 --> 12:24.720
you should 
 bring your printer.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.080
Don't worry.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.880
Once I get the new data 
 from scooter

12:28.880 --> 12:31.480
I can input it 
 into the computer

12:31.480 --> 12:33.280
and send the info 
 to Danielle

12:33.280 --> 12:34.440
with my approval.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.320
Then... 
 I can relax a little.

13:04.080 --> 13:07.200
Then, my parents 
 are going to kill me.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.440
It's not 
 your fault.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.920
You can explain 
 how it really happened.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.360
It's not like you 
 sent invitations.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.280
Did you see the look 
 on her face

13:15.280 --> 13:17.600
when you showed up?

13:17.600 --> 13:18.640
Totally clueless.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.080
Gee, I wonder who did.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.480
Alex: 
 Enjoying yourself?

13:23.480 --> 13:26.080
Kelly: Alex... uh, we were 
 just talking about you.

13:26.080 --> 13:29.320
That's about the only honest 
 thing you've said today.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.800
Excuse me?

13:30.800 --> 13:32.280
Don't play dumb, Kelly.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.920
I know you planned this.

13:33.920 --> 13:36.160
After everything 
 you've done to me

13:36.160 --> 13:38.360
I still gave you 
 one more chance.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.840
How could you do 
 something like this?

13:40.840 --> 13:43.040

14:11.760 --> 14:15.720
Very interesting.

Great!

Funny how he always seems to be 
 in the men's room

14:52.880 --> 14:54.440
instead of the lab.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.680
You tell Mack I will deal 
 with him later.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.480
Not to worry, gentlemen.

 in detention together

15:47.120 --> 15:49.040
you and Kelly become... 
 "Friends"?

15:49.040 --> 15:51.040
Well, not exactly 
 friends.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.880
You invite her 
 to hang out.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.480
Ray and Louis and 
 Robyn and Nicole...

15:55.480 --> 15:57.640
They all stop by 
 to say hello.

15:57.640 --> 16:01.320
Well, just to make sure 
 everything was cool with Kelly.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.040
Well, apparently, 
 it wasn't

16:03.040 --> 16:05.440
because every kid 
 in Paradise Valley

16:05.440 --> 16:07.720
is making themselves 
 at home here.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.280
How could you let this happen?

16:12.240 --> 16:13.880
What are we 
 going to do?

16:13.880 --> 16:15.400
What do you 
 mean, "we"?

16:15.400 --> 16:16.640

It's not like I sent out 
 invitations.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.560

16:25.400 --> 16:26.440
Come on, Annie.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.760
I need your help.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.280
Okay.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.040
What we need 
 is a distraction.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.440
Do you think you can get 
 to the fuse box?

16:35.440 --> 16:36.440
What for?

16:36.440 --> 16:37.640
Use your powers

16:37.640 --> 16:40.120
to cause a surge 
 in the circuit breakers.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.480
Once there's 
 an electrical malfunction

16:42.480 --> 16:44.160
I'll take care 
 of the rest.

to put those powers 
 to good use.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.120
You have a lot 
 of work to do

20:24.120 --> 20:26.120
before Mom and Dad get home.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.640
<i>Mrs. Mack: 
 I can't wait to go home.</i>

20:32.640 --> 20:35.800
This trip has been 
 the most stressful vacation

20:35.800 --> 20:37.080
we've ever taken.

20:38.560 --> 20:39.520
George!

20:39.520 --> 20:42.240
What's Danielle 
 doing here?

20:42.240 --> 20:44.480
I saw her yesterday 
 in the lobby.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.480
I didn't want to ruin 
 our last night here so

20:47.480 --> 20:49.520
I was going 
 to tell you later.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.600
And...

20:51.720 --> 20:54.720
I'm going to deal with this...

20:54.720 --> 20:55.960
Right now.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.080
<i>( Panting )</i>

21:00.080 --> 21:00.920
Miss Atron!

21:00.920 --> 21:01.800
Mack!

21:01.800 --> 21:03.480
What are you 
 doing here?

21:03.480 --> 21:04.320
<i>( Panting )</i>

21:04.320 --> 21:05.560
I realized how urgently

21:05.560 --> 21:07.600
you needed 
 this information so

21:07.600 --> 21:09.840
I found out where you 
 were staying

21:09.840 --> 21:11.640
and I rushed right over.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.520
I hope you don't mind.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.440
It depends.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.480
Does it have 
 what I need?

21:16.480 --> 21:18.800
I don't think 
 you'll be disappointed.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.800
<i>( Panting )</i>

21:19.800 --> 21:21.200
Gentlemen...

21:21.200 --> 21:24.720
Looks like we have some 
 negotiating to do.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.080
Mack, good work.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.120
You've really 
 outdone yourself.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.920
Maybe you should take 
 a little time off.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.040
You look like 
 you could use it.

21:40.920 --> 21:43.800
<i>( Horn honks )</i>

21:43.800 --> 21:46.600
I think I just heard 
 the car pull up.

21:46.600 --> 21:50.080
<i>( Vacuum running )</i>

21:50.080 --> 21:54.520
<i>( Vacuuming continues )</i>

21:54.520 --> 21:57.680
This is cutting it close.

21:57.680 --> 22:01.120
<i>( Vacuum running )</i>

22:01.120 --> 22:03.320
<i>( Vacuum goes off, 
 light switch clicks )</i>

22:03.320 --> 22:04.400
<i>( Clears throat )</i>

22:05.480 --> 22:06.120
Hi!

22:06.120 --> 22:06.840
Hi!

22:06.840 --> 22:07.520
Hi, girls.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.240
How are you?

22:08.240 --> 22:09.240
Hi, sweetheart.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.720
Hey, look at the house.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.040
It looks great.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.320
We should leave town 
 more often.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.000
Annie, I owe you.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
<i>( Sighs )</i>

22:19.000 --> 22:19.720
Hmm.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.680
Don't worry.

22:21.680 --> 22:22.920
I know.

22:25.800 --> 22:28.280
<i>Nicole: So how did 
 it go with your parents?</i>

22:28.280 --> 22:29.320
Fine.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.600
I think they were glad 
 to be back.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.800
Hi, Alex.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.320
<i>( Giggles )</i>

22:34.320 --> 22:36.440
How could I have been 
 so stupid?

22:36.440 --> 22:38.880
Don't be so hard 
 on yourself, Alex.

22:38.880 --> 22:41.400
Hey, Alex, heard you 
 had a great party.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.640
Sorry I missed it.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.800
A bunch of us 
 went up to the lake.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.000
Really? I thought 
 you had to work.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.320
Who told you that?

22:48.320 --> 22:49.680
Kelly.

22:49.680 --> 22:52.840
That's strange.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.720
I told her we spend 
 lots of time together.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.360
I wanted to do 
 something different.

22:56.360 --> 22:57.520
<i>That is strange.</i>

22:57.520 --> 22:58.680
<i>( School bell rings )</i>

22:58.680 --> 23:00.160
I better 
 get to class.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.680
I'll... see you later.

23:01.680 --> 23:02.760
Bye.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.120
What's wrong?

23:14.120 --> 23:15.600
You won't believe this.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.640
I can't find 
 my make-up homework.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.400
I was sure 
 I had it with me.

23:19.400 --> 23:20.760
Hey, Alex...

23:20.760 --> 23:23.640
I have an idea 
 where your homework might be.
