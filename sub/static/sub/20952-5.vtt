WEBVTT

00:09.676 --> 00:13.981
It takes adaption, skills, endurance...

00:17.718 --> 00:22.089
...but it takes flexibility
to be able to use the whole body.

00:24.057 --> 00:25.659
<i>He's doing it!</i>

00:25.726 --> 00:29.429
I was a B-boy. Not just a street dancer.

00:29.496 --> 00:33.066
<i>So I'm confident with my body.</i>

00:33.133 --> 00:37.571
I'm good at what I like.
So if I get my groove on,

00:37.971 --> 00:40.274
it's going to work for me.

01:16.210 --> 01:21.181
-He's doing it!
-It shows how much he's...

01:36.930 --> 01:38.866
As far as I'm concerned, I'm a happy man.

01:38.932 --> 01:42.035
I'm always positive

01:42.102 --> 01:45.439
and optimistic.

08:19.966 --> 08:22.435
-So close!
-Satoshi!

08:30.310 --> 08:31.144
Go, Alfredo!

08:40.053 --> 08:44.291
With a little more patience,
I could have gone further.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.159
Maybe even finished it.

09:40.814 --> 09:46.420
My life changed
when I started seeing my now ex-husband.

09:46.486 --> 09:49.756
<i>I suffered psychological violence.</i>

09:49.823 --> 09:51.925
He destroyed my self-esteem.

09:52.025 --> 09:55.462
<i>It was a very tough experience.</i>

09:56.930 --> 10:00.600
In a way, it made me click.

10:01.067 --> 10:06.973
I found out about CrossFit
and I win because I set my mind to it.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.625
As I see it,
my biggest reward is my daughter.

10:24.691 --> 10:27.895
<i>Fanny, you're always with me...</i>

10:28.896 --> 10:31.899
...and this is for you.

10:40.106 --> 10:46.579
-Yes, Gina, that's it! Of course!
-You're a total warrior!

11:23.349 --> 11:25.752
-You deserve this, you got this!
-Come on, Gina!

11:26.319 --> 11:29.355
She fell by the third coil, my dear Gina.

11:29.422 --> 11:33.326
-Such a great effort, Gina. Very good!
-She fell like a warrior.

11:39.266 --> 11:42.069
I thought the coils were closer to me.

11:42.135 --> 11:45.439
<i>Oh, well...</i>
<i>It was a good one nonetheless.</i>

11:45.905 --> 11:47.440
<i>I'm so happy!</i>

11:49.042 --> 11:50.911
Tired, but happy.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.423
I had a hard time as a kid.

12:03.489 --> 12:06.960
<i>I was very skinny. A nerd.</i>

12:07.327 --> 12:10.063
<i>Shaolin fighting helped me,</i>
<i>made me strong.</i>

12:10.129 --> 12:12.865
<i>I entered this competition</i>

12:12.933 --> 12:16.503
<i>for all the nerds out there.</i>

12:16.570 --> 12:18.739
The people who are teased.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.814
Michael Pela, go for it, brother!

12:34.087 --> 12:37.791
Great potential,
but the Beast is merciless.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.107
Oh good, he made it.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.575
So far so good.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.377
I'm so relieved he made it!

13:41.188 --> 13:43.957
Just out of his reach!

13:44.023 --> 13:45.091
And down he goes!

13:54.601 --> 13:56.803
Very good.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.439
He is going to Level 2 now. He did well.

14:02.276 --> 14:05.379
-Wow, man.
-He was doing so well.

14:37.711 --> 14:42.916
I love extreme experiences,
to do things not many people do.

15:03.237 --> 15:06.006
Now he has tasted blood!

15:27.895 --> 15:30.430
I wanted to make some extra points...

15:31.265 --> 15:33.033
...so I pulled the green lever.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.270
If I had gone back,
I might not have made it,

15:36.336 --> 15:38.505
and my hand already hurts,
so I wanted to give it some rest.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.121
<i>My name is Roberto Perez.</i>

15:54.188 --> 15:56.390
<i>I'd like to honor my country's name</i>

15:56.456 --> 15:59.393
and show everyone
that Mexicans are great athletes.

16:00.092 --> 16:02.361
<i>I've been practicing Olympic gymnastics</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

16:04.230 --> 16:06.032
<i>Then I started to climb.</i>

16:06.098 --> 16:08.801
<i>I love what this sport gives me,</i>

16:08.868 --> 16:12.038
<i>because it's highly demanding,</i>
<i>both physically and mentally.</i>

16:12.104 --> 16:15.475
<i>I'd like to focus on mental strength</i>
<i>being my strong suit.</i>

16:15.541 --> 16:17.043
<i>I hope to surprise everybody.</i>

17:02.956 --> 17:04.925
Let's go, yeah! There you go!

17:04.992 --> 17:06.159
There he is.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.562
-Rober's a coil away...
-Just one more.

17:08.629 --> 17:10.731
It's the nearest one.

17:10.796 --> 17:12.632
I don't want to jinx it,
but there he goes!

17:15.735 --> 17:19.972
Always Mexico! Yes, sir!

17:51.170 --> 17:53.639
-Yes! That's it!
-Go, Mexico!

18:45.958 --> 18:47.994
I'm a fireman.

18:48.060 --> 18:52.498
<i>I wanted to do a job</i>
<i>where I could protect other people.</i>

18:52.965 --> 18:54.834
I will be the Beastmaster.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.473
-Tomomichi has great upper-body strength.
-Way to go!

19:33.207 --> 19:35.843
He's in trouble.
He can't afford to get stuck here.

19:35.909 --> 19:37.878
-He's almost there.
-Can he make it?

20:59.927 --> 21:03.764
He's in trouble.
He can't afford to get stuck here.

21:32.793 --> 21:35.662
<i>He's almost there.</i>

21:35.729 --> 21:37.497
<i>Can he make it?</i>

21:39.132 --> 21:41.802
No way! After all that effort!

24:40.781 --> 24:43.016
I practice parkour and free running.

24:43.083 --> 24:47.487
I go outside and practice

24:47.553 --> 24:51.256
in all the free places I can find.

25:44.311 --> 25:47.681
He is doing really well!
You think we'll see him on Level 3?

26:32.993 --> 26:34.061
What a shame!

26:39.333 --> 26:41.835
<i>My hand really hurts, but I did it.</i>

26:41.902 --> 26:45.239
As long as my hand's still attached,
I'm happy.

27:55.909 --> 27:57.277
Chico, no!

28:00.314 --> 28:03.650
It's a pity. He performed very well
in the first round.

28:03.717 --> 28:06.253
But unfortunately, Chico is out.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.322
It's a pity!

28:48.662 --> 28:51.465
-Yes! Well done, Rober!
-My man Rober!

30:18.385 --> 30:23.323
And that's 20 points for my man Rober!

30:53.453 --> 30:56.523
I'm proud,
but I thought I was going to finish it.

30:56.590 --> 30:58.825
Awesome. It was great, I loved it.

31:19.778 --> 31:22.447
I'm a <i>capoeirista </i>and an acrobat.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.487
<i>I teach in the Vidigal community</i>
<i>where I live,</i>

31:28.553 --> 31:32.591
and all my students said,
"Go and bring that trophy here, man."

31:32.958 --> 31:35.260
<i>I'll be the first</i>

31:35.327 --> 31:37.262
Ultimate Beastmaster.

31:40.265 --> 31:44.870
Attention ladies and gentlemen,
now a Brazilian, my countryman,

31:44.936 --> 31:46.938
is going to challenge the Beast.

31:47.007 --> 31:49.443
It's the great Alfredo Bermudes.

33:04.885 --> 33:06.620
Go to Point Thruster!

33:11.491 --> 33:12.326
Let's go, <i>tchÃª!</i>

33:23.203 --> 33:25.639
It's important
that he gets the Point Thruster,

33:25.706 --> 33:28.842
because only five pass
to the next phase, Anderson.

34:06.547 --> 34:08.148
Don't worry, Alfredo!

36:19.010 --> 36:24.082
On Level 1, I injured my hand
jumping off the Energy Coils.

36:24.151 --> 36:26.520
<i>On Level 2, my hand was still injured.</i>

36:26.587 --> 36:28.822
We'll see if I can manage to hold on.

37:13.834 --> 37:15.335
Come on, Hell! Come on!

37:15.402 --> 37:18.205
-Go!
-Pull yourself up!

37:59.279 --> 38:04.451
-No!
-Now he loses 40 points!

38:10.791 --> 38:13.126
I could have made it. That annoys me.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.969
My body's in pain,

38:25.036 --> 38:29.107
<i>but I'm going to push through this</i>
<i>with everything I've got.</i>

38:29.176 --> 38:32.980
<i>I have to do this</i>
<i>for all the members of Team Japan</i>

38:33.046 --> 38:38.185
who couldn't make it.

38:50.695 --> 38:52.497
-He's got good posture here.
-Go for it!

38:53.333 --> 38:55.536
Into the blood again!

39:07.181 --> 39:11.885
I had good height off the jump,
but just couldn't grab onto it.

42:11.798 --> 42:14.535
I am representing my country, my city,

42:14.601 --> 42:16.703
because I am one of the best in Brazil.

42:16.770 --> 42:19.173
And that's what I want to show.

42:19.239 --> 42:21.642
I want to show that I can be
at the top, in first.

42:47.298 --> 42:50.568
Nobody knows exactly
what's going on there.

42:54.341 --> 42:57.177
That's what I have to put up with.
Do you see this?

43:42.756 --> 43:44.925
Level 4! Come on!

43:44.992 --> 43:47.861
-Level 4!
-Level 4!

43:47.928 --> 43:51.298
-Come on, my Rober!
-Go, Rober!

43:51.362 --> 43:53.030
You got this, brother!

44:52.323 --> 44:55.526
-Come on, my Rober!
-Come on, buddy!

45:12.980 --> 45:15.549
He balances the platforms,
trying to get closer...

45:15.613 --> 45:18.883
-That's it!
-That's it. Well done, Rober! Awesome!

45:37.404 --> 45:40.140
That's it! Give it your all!

45:41.141 --> 45:45.012
Amazing! I loved the level.

45:45.078 --> 45:48.949
I tried to play it safe
and save strength for the finals.

45:49.016 --> 45:51.785
So I couldn't do the trapeze.
That would've been fun.

45:51.852 --> 45:53.987
But I enjoyed and I loved it.

45:54.051 --> 45:59.757
Huge competitors here.
It's a great vibe, I felt really good.

46:30.090 --> 46:33.260
Sometimes people don't know
what to expect from me.

46:33.324 --> 46:35.993
<i>They don't see the passion that moves me.</i>

46:48.339 --> 46:51.676
<i>My main motivation</i>
<i>is the personal challenge</i>

46:52.279 --> 46:55.716
of being here with great athletes
and showing what I'm capable of.

46:55.782 --> 46:57.217
<i>It's what motivates me the most.</i>

47:10.197 --> 47:12.599
<i>I'm here to give it all my passion,</i>

47:12.666 --> 47:15.235
<i>all my abilities and effort</i>

47:15.302 --> 47:17.304
to honor the name of my country.

47:17.371 --> 47:18.305
Go, Mexico!

49:20.727 --> 49:22.596
-Get him back up!
-No...

49:34.508 --> 49:36.710
Mexico!

49:59.233 --> 50:03.136
Mexico!

50:21.722 --> 50:24.324
Incredible, man. It's...

50:24.391 --> 50:26.159
I'm psyched, I don't believe it!

50:26.223 --> 50:29.493
I'm so happy to be here.
These are great competitors.

50:29.563 --> 50:33.767
I'd go through the obstacles again,
give it more, do it even better!

50:36.570 --> 50:40.374
Mexico!
