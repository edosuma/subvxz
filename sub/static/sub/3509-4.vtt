00:00.187 --> 00:01.136
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.193 --> 00:02.793
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.127 --> 00:04.853
Psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:05.091 --> 00:06.113
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.514 --> 00:07.114
Who am I?

00:07.203 --> 00:08.342
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.343 --> 00:08.743
Castle.

00:08.777 --> 00:09.437
Castle.

00:09.438 --> 00:11.138
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.192 --> 00:13.382
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:13.592 --> 00:14.411
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:14.658 --> 00:15.925
Beckett.
Aah!

00:16.198 --> 00:18.283
Beckett?
Could you get some backup, please?

00:18.634 --> 00:20.518
<i>And thanks to my friendship</i>
<i>with the Mayor,</i>

00:20.569 --> 00:22.203
<i>I get to be on her case.</i>
Oh!

00:22.237 --> 00:24.806
Do I look like a killer to you?
Yes, you kill my patience.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.474
<i>And together,</i>
<i>we catch killers.</i>

00:27.022 --> 00:29.924
I hate this case.
I know. Isn't it great?

01:05.453 --> 01:06.971
I have delicately placed

01:07.014 --> 01:10.083
one Graham cracker,
exactly six marshmallows,

01:10.088 --> 01:13.056
atop a perfectly melted
chocolate bar.

01:13.057 --> 01:14.724
In an omelet, darling,
really?

01:14.725 --> 01:16.159
Not an omelet.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.561
A s'morelet.
Uh-huh.

01:18.562 --> 01:20.697
Care for one?
No, thank you.

01:20.698 --> 01:22.633
What about you, sweetheart?

01:22.634 --> 01:24.551
Are you ready for your
taste buds to be launched

01:24.552 --> 01:26.987
into breakfast Nirvana?
Sure, thanks.

01:26.988 --> 01:29.339
Oh, is it okay if my friend
Ashley comes over tonight?

01:29.340 --> 01:31.508
Yes, of course. Now eat.

01:36.113 --> 01:37.564
Dad.

01:37.565 --> 01:40.250
Are there marshmallows in this?
Yes.

01:40.251 --> 01:41.885
And chocolate?
Yes.

01:41.886 --> 01:43.887
That's the point.
It's a s'morelet.

01:43.888 --> 01:47.190
I... I gotta go. Love you.

01:47.191 --> 01:48.959
Love you.
Bye, honey.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.694
Mmm.

01:52.132 --> 01:54.767
This is almost as good as my
chocolate mousse chimichanga.

01:54.768 --> 01:56.735
Aha.
I knew you'd reconsider.

01:56.736 --> 01:58.654
It's kinda like
David Hasselhoff.

01:58.655 --> 02:00.639
At first you're repulsed,
but then strangely,

02:00.640 --> 02:02.541
you're drawn in.
No, still repulsed. Bye.

02:02.542 --> 02:04.376
Mm.

02:04.377 --> 02:06.345
Wonder what's up with Alexis?

02:06.346 --> 02:08.614
She seems a little out of it.
Isn't it obvious?

02:08.615 --> 02:11.300
What?
Oh, she's in love.

02:11.301 --> 02:14.153
Alexis?
Oh, come on, darling.

02:14.154 --> 02:16.246
In case you haven't noticed,
she's not a little girl anymore.

02:16.256 --> 02:16.865
Thank you, mother.

02:17.023 --> 02:19.321
I think if Alexis were in love,
she would've told me.

02:19.331 --> 02:20.437
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

02:20.438 --> 02:23.596
The fact that she hasn't told
you is how we know it's real.

02:23.597 --> 02:25.397
Mother.

02:25.398 --> 02:29.268
Okay, and the fact that she...
Mentioned it to me last night.

02:29.269 --> 02:31.637
Who is he?
W-where did she meet him?

02:31.638 --> 02:33.622
I don't know.
She wouldn't say.

02:34.442 --> 02:36.460
No, diva's honor.
She didn't tell me anything.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.327
She didn't even tell me
his name.

02:39.328 --> 02:41.897
I can't believe she told you
and not me.

02:41.898 --> 02:43.051
I'm supposed to be
her go-to guy.

02:43.151 --> 02:45.619
Oh, darling,
of course you are.

02:45.620 --> 02:47.538
It's just, you know,
it's first love.

02:47.539 --> 02:49.623
It's magical, ethereal.

02:49.624 --> 02:52.092
It defies logic.

02:54.786 --> 02:57.154
Richard, your phone?

02:57.155 --> 02:58.639
Mm.

02:59.774 --> 03:02.660
Oh, Beckett. Maybe it's
a nice murder, darling.

03:02.661 --> 03:05.529
Brighten your day.

03:05.530 --> 03:07.698
Good boy.

03:07.699 --> 03:09.600
Castle.

03:09.601 --> 03:11.535
When Alexis took
her first steps,

03:11.536 --> 03:14.188
I was there to catch her
when she fell.

03:14.189 --> 03:16.640
The first time she rode her bike
without training wheels,

03:16.641 --> 03:18.642
I was the maniac
chasing her down the street

03:18.643 --> 03:19.537
screaming for her
to watch out

03:19.612 --> 03:20.967
for the old lady
with the walker.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.190
Even her first word--
let me guess. "Daddy"?

03:25.335 --> 03:27.336
No, it was "denouement."
Oh.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.288
I stressed story structure
from an early age.

03:28.298 --> 03:28.818
Uh-huh.

03:28.971 --> 03:33.023
Anyway, I'm afraid that this is
the beginning of the end

03:33.121 --> 03:35.121
of our special thing.

03:36.058 --> 03:37.926
Well, you know,
I wouldn't worry, Castle.

03:38.027 --> 03:39.659
I mean, I've seen the way
that she looks at you.

03:39.822 --> 03:42.791
Your real problem is that girls
who adore their daddies

03:42.792 --> 03:44.691
usually end up marrying guys
just like them.

03:44.927 --> 03:46.611
They do?
Dr. Parish.

03:46.612 --> 03:49.030
Good morning.
Got an I.D.?

03:49.031 --> 03:51.666
Not yet. How come you guys
never bring me coffee?

03:51.667 --> 03:54.369
I'm here before you
doing all the work.

03:54.370 --> 03:55.254
You can have
the rest of mine.

03:55.264 --> 03:56.754
Actually,
I don't drink coffee.

03:56.839 --> 03:59.307
But would it kill you
to bring me a bear claw?

03:59.308 --> 04:01.176
Speaking of killing.

04:01.177 --> 04:03.044
Single G.S.W. to the chest,

04:03.045 --> 04:05.614
large caliber,
probably a .45.

04:05.615 --> 04:07.983
Lividity suggests time of death
around midnight.

04:07.984 --> 04:09.751
Hey.

04:10.154 --> 04:12.122
I have those boxers.
Thomas Nash.

04:13.021 --> 04:14.455
Very pricey British brand.

04:14.456 --> 04:17.324
Amazingly soft. They're silk.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.695
I'm just saying, he was
probably very comfortable

04:21.696 --> 04:25.165
when he was shot and killed.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.634
So what was this guy
doing out here

04:27.635 --> 04:28.701
practically naked
at midnight?

04:28.711 --> 04:31.280
Don't bother with any of your
perverted theories, Castle.

04:31.452 --> 04:32.987
I found fibers
in the bullet hole.

04:33.052 --> 04:35.104
Which means he was wearing
clothes when he was shot.

04:35.114 --> 04:37.183
That doesn't make any sense.
The killer shot him

04:37.226 --> 04:39.227
and then hung around to take
his bloody clothes off him?

04:39.238 --> 04:41.173
Well, maybe the killer was
worried that there was

04:41.174 --> 04:42.972
forensic evidence on the clothes
that would connect them.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.628
Yo. Uni found this wallet out
in a garbage can near fifth.

04:46.629 --> 04:49.047
Photo on the license matches
Captain underpants here.

04:50.959 --> 04:54.028
Sorry. My nephew
loves those books.

04:54.029 --> 04:57.164
Daniel Goldstein, 25,
lives in Soho.

04:57.895 --> 05:00.147
Yeah, he's also got
a work I.D. from Berman Rose

05:00.148 --> 05:00.865
down on Wall Street.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.918
So he lived downtown
and he worked downtown.

05:02.919 --> 05:05.921
What was he doing way up here?
Let's take this down to the lab.

05:05.922 --> 05:07.640
Right.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.158
So I wear boxers.

05:09.159 --> 05:12.611
What do you wear--
thongs, cheekies?

05:12.612 --> 05:14.513
I told you mine.

05:14.514 --> 05:15.915
Bloomers?

05:15.916 --> 05:17.600
Granny panties?

05:17.601 --> 05:19.168
Commando?

05:22.034 --> 05:23.935
His clothes were taken?

05:23.936 --> 05:26.204
Why would anyone
take his clothes?

05:26.205 --> 05:28.173
We don't know, Ms. Goldstein.
Can you tell us

05:28.174 --> 05:29.554
what your brother might have
been doing in the park?

05:29.564 --> 05:31.241
That late? I have no idea.

05:31.483 --> 05:33.384
Well, the place
where Daniel was found

05:33.385 --> 05:35.286
is known for drug activity.
Was he using?

05:35.287 --> 05:36.821
No. He barely even drank.

05:36.822 --> 05:39.624
Did he have any enemies
or conflicts that you know of?

05:39.625 --> 05:42.026
No, no. Look, none of this
makes any sense.

05:42.890 --> 05:45.125
It's just--
it's not like him.

05:46.579 --> 05:48.880
Our parents both died
in a car accident

05:48.914 --> 05:49.748
when he was 12,

05:49.803 --> 05:52.805
and since then,
he's always been so cautious.

05:52.806 --> 05:55.174
What about dating? Was there
anyone special in his life?

05:55.175 --> 05:56.070
Oh, he wished, but no.

05:56.071 --> 05:58.738
No, he barely had a social life
or social skills.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.270
I mean, he was
such a sweetheart,

06:01.271 --> 06:03.539
but a dork, you know?

06:03.540 --> 06:06.127
And he was always
at work anyway.

06:06.434 --> 06:09.102
At Berman Rose?
What did he do for them?

06:09.103 --> 06:10.537
Created financial products.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.256
He was
this incredible math genius.

06:13.426 --> 06:15.344
Got his PhD from M.I.T.

06:15.345 --> 06:17.878
I thought for sure he'd be
a Professor or something,

06:18.028 --> 06:21.429
but these hedge funds,
they hire guys like him,

06:21.448 --> 06:24.017
and they pay them
obscene amounts of money.

06:24.018 --> 06:27.987
25 years old--he bought
my apartment for me.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.958
Excuse me.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.195
What's up?

06:36.196 --> 06:38.648
Lab got a fingerprint
off our vic's wallet.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.149
Anyone good?

06:40.150 --> 06:41.901
Uh...

06:44.171 --> 06:46.172
Awaiting court dates

06:46.173 --> 06:48.107
on three
aggravated assault cases

06:48.108 --> 06:50.677
in the past month,
Mr. D'AndrÃ©.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.779
You inflicted dozens
of broken bones,

06:53.854 --> 06:55.855
gouged out
one of your victim's eyes,

06:55.868 --> 06:58.269
bit off part of an ear
of another one.

06:58.270 --> 07:00.138
Sounds like committing murder
was inevitable.

07:00.139 --> 07:02.774
I'm just curious.
Why did you take his clothes?

07:02.775 --> 07:04.409
Wasn't me.

07:04.410 --> 07:06.411
Well, then why
were your fingerprints

07:06.412 --> 07:08.847
on a dead man's wallet?
Did he just happen to drop it,

07:08.848 --> 07:10.782
and you politely
picked it up for him?

07:10.783 --> 07:12.817
And why did
my detectives find

07:12.818 --> 07:16.121
this unregistered .45
in your apartment,

07:16.122 --> 07:18.056
which just happens to match

07:18.057 --> 07:20.428
the size of the bullet hole
in my victim?

07:22.068 --> 07:24.271
Hey.
If you're so innocent, Mr. D'AndrÃ©,

07:24.368 --> 07:25.968
why did you resist arrest

07:25.969 --> 07:29.405
and try to put one of
my detectives through a wall?

07:29.406 --> 07:32.575
<i>Your silence only makes you look guiltier.</i>
You know, the right turtleneck,

07:32.576 --> 07:35.498
<i>give me a reason...</i>
And no one is even gonna notice, bro.

07:36.313 --> 07:38.881
Maybe a scarf.

07:38.882 --> 07:41.384
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>just confess to the truth?</i>

07:41.385 --> 07:43.641
It's gonna come out
sooner or later.

07:43.651 --> 07:45.014
He was already dead.

07:45.158 --> 07:47.960
With a wallet lying
conveniently next to him?

07:47.961 --> 07:50.529
Uh, look,

07:50.530 --> 07:53.299
if you're not
going to admit to it,

07:53.300 --> 07:55.301
you might at least want
to try coming up with a story

07:55.336 --> 07:56.262
that's a little more convincing.

07:56.272 --> 07:57.863
It's what happened!

08:05.808 --> 08:07.309
Like you weren't scared.

08:07.310 --> 08:09.311
I want this guy
to fry, Beckett.

08:09.312 --> 08:10.379
Oh, he will,

08:10.421 --> 08:13.656
as soon as Lanie confirms that
that bullet is a .45.

08:13.657 --> 08:15.925
It's not a .45.
Are you sure?

08:15.926 --> 08:18.061
I'm positive.
.38?

08:18.062 --> 08:20.430
Nope. It's not
a .44 or a .357

08:20.431 --> 08:22.649
or a .22 or a 9 millimeter

08:22.650 --> 08:24.651
or any other kind of bullet
I've ever seen.

08:24.652 --> 08:26.106
So it's
a new kind of bullet.

08:26.270 --> 08:28.905
Oh, no. Not new at all.
Check it out.

08:31.977 --> 08:33.979
Oh, it's round.
You see that white coating?

08:34.029 --> 08:35.663
Yeah. What is it, oxidation?

08:35.739 --> 08:38.073
Lead oxide, to be exact.
Rust?

08:38.075 --> 08:40.076
Yep. Based on
the amount of it,

08:40.077 --> 08:42.245
I'd say that bullet
is 200 years old.

08:43.815 --> 08:47.652
A 200-year-old bullet
can only mean one thing.

08:47.689 --> 08:49.239
Time-traveling killer.

08:53.561 --> 08:57.163

-- for <font color=#00ffff>www.addic7ed.com</font> --

09:02.556 --> 09:05.734
Ergo, the killer
could've entered present time

09:05.751 --> 09:07.752
through a time ripple,
killed Goldstein,

09:07.753 --> 09:09.054
and then gone back through
the time ripple,

09:09.055 --> 09:10.889
which means we just have to
find the time ripple.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.926
Could you <i>please</i> stop saying
"time ripple"?

09:12.927 --> 09:15.702
Yeah. It sounds kinda dirty,
doesn't it?

09:16.556 --> 09:18.291
What if
the ripple closed?

09:18.338 --> 09:19.339
Time machine.

09:19.363 --> 09:21.364
We need a time machine.
Well, in this century,

09:21.365 --> 09:24.100
we still haven't ruled out
our big buddy Mr. D'AndrÃ©.

09:24.101 --> 09:26.653
Yeah, he just doesn't seem like
the time-travel type to me.

09:26.663 --> 09:28.122
Can't be
a time-traveling killer.

09:28.122 --> 09:30.140
Bullet had 200 years of rust
on it. If the killer had been

09:30.143 --> 09:31.592
a time traveler, the bullet
would've been brand-new.

09:31.602 --> 09:33.893
Unless time travel
causes rust.

09:33.993 --> 09:35.994
On your brain.
Have you followed up

09:35.995 --> 09:37.996
with the victim's sister
regarding the antique bullet?

09:37.997 --> 09:40.265
Yep. She has no clue about
antique bullets or guns,

09:40.266 --> 09:41.047
but there's somebody who does.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.920
Abe Sandrich--antique weapons
expert you requested.

09:45.026 --> 09:46.910
That reminds me,
I'm starving.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.798
I like .45s.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.449
Catch the right angle,

09:52.450 --> 09:55.102
this sucker could
take your head clean off.

09:55.103 --> 09:56.587
But...

09:56.588 --> 09:59.006
It's not the gun
you're looking for.

09:59.007 --> 09:59.744
Why is that?

09:59.754 --> 10:01.081
Barrel would've
had to be modified.

10:01.604 --> 10:03.056
This one's factory fresh.

10:03.066 --> 10:04.266
Well,
do you think D'AndrÃ© the giant

10:04.283 --> 10:04.816
was telling the truth

10:04.885 --> 10:06.886
when he said he found
the wallet in the grass?

10:06.887 --> 10:09.222
Well, the killer
did take Goldstein's clothes,

10:09.223 --> 10:11.191
so it's possible that
the wallet might have fallen out

10:11.192 --> 10:12.693
when he left the crime scene.

10:12.701 --> 10:13.469
What kind of a pistol

10:13.547 --> 10:14.767
would've fired that bullet?

10:14.777 --> 10:17.315
We usually
just call 'em lead balls

10:17.316 --> 10:19.450
for, uh, obvious reasons.

10:19.489 --> 10:22.187
I'd say a whole lot
of 18th century flintlocks--

10:22.191 --> 10:24.192
too many brands
to even speculate.

10:24.870 --> 10:26.871
You'll need to find
the actual pistol

10:26.872 --> 10:28.807
to match it to this lead ball.

10:28.808 --> 10:31.387
And how many people would own
that kind of antique pistol?

10:31.395 --> 10:33.711
It's hard to say.
They're considered collectibles,

10:34.063 --> 10:35.315
so they don't
have to be registered.

10:35.355 --> 10:37.824
Making it pretty smart
to kill someone with one.

10:37.834 --> 10:39.029
Oh, yeah.

10:39.129 --> 10:40.629
The guns may be old,

10:40.630 --> 10:43.132
but, uh, they got plenty
of killing left in 'em.

10:44.735 --> 10:46.169
So is, uh, D'AndrÃ© our guy?

10:46.355 --> 10:47.228
I'm afraid not.

10:47.238 --> 10:49.700
W-why did he go
all Hulk Hogan on me?

10:49.871 --> 10:52.406
Well, why did the scorpion
sting the frog? It's his nature.

10:52.407 --> 10:54.225
Yeah, well,
D'AndrÃ© will be seeing nature

10:54.247 --> 10:56.432
from behind bars from now on
for assaulting an officer.

10:56.450 --> 10:58.087
I'll see he gets the max,
Detective.

10:58.097 --> 10:59.125
Thank you, Captain.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.373
You can take a couple days
if you like, catch some movies.

11:01.383 --> 11:02.232
Read "Naked Heat."

11:02.462 --> 11:05.230
No. No need, sir.

11:12.596 --> 11:15.064
Still no luck with the clothes.
Unis looked in every garbage can

11:15.164 --> 11:16.832
within 5-block radius
of the park.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.927
What is so special
about these clothes

11:19.928 --> 11:21.613
that our killer
would take them?

11:21.621 --> 11:23.622
Maybe the killer came through
the time ripple naked

11:23.623 --> 11:26.124
and needed the clothes...

11:26.125 --> 11:27.826
Like in "The Terminator."

11:29.695 --> 11:32.281
Sadly, I don't have
a better theory at this point.

11:32.301 --> 11:33.968
So the question is,

11:33.969 --> 11:36.621
what did a Wall Street
number cruncher like Goldstein

11:36.622 --> 11:38.990
get himself into?

11:38.991 --> 11:40.992
Castle and I will go
to his firm.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.968
You guys see if you can track
down any antique gun enthusiasts

11:43.141 --> 11:44.742
on social media sites
or local clubs.

11:44.821 --> 11:46.548
Maybe someone from
Goldstein's life will pop.

11:46.558 --> 11:47.558
You got it.

11:49.727 --> 11:52.079
You know, I just don't get

11:52.080 --> 11:55.115
how someone could shoot
Goldstein, steal his clothes,

11:55.116 --> 11:57.084
and then not hang on
to his wallet.

11:57.085 --> 11:59.736
It just doesn't make
any sense.

11:59.737 --> 12:02.139
No.

12:02.140 --> 12:05.208
Maybe giant moths killed him
and then ate his clothes.

12:05.209 --> 12:06.944
Could be.

12:06.945 --> 12:09.846
Hey, Castle.

12:09.847 --> 12:12.256
If this case is boring for you,
you don't have to stay.

12:12.350 --> 12:15.030
No, I-I'm just checking my e-mails,
my texts, see if Alexis called.

12:15.214 --> 12:17.249
I can't believe she told
my mother she's in love

12:17.250 --> 12:19.051
and is holding out on me.
Oh.

12:19.052 --> 12:19.872
I'm gonna call her.

12:19.882 --> 12:21.967
No, no. You have to
let her tell you

12:22.121 --> 12:23.620
in her own time,
when she's ready.

12:23.630 --> 12:25.424
I'm the cool dad.
Why can't she be ready?

12:25.481 --> 12:26.031
Listen to me.

12:26.115 --> 12:28.000
My dad tried to do the same
thing when I was her age,

12:28.001 --> 12:30.302
and I ended up dating
a grunge rocker who smelled like

12:30.377 --> 12:32.545
wet flannel and clove cigarettes
for seven months.

12:32.546 --> 12:36.482
You do not mess with
a teenage girl and her hormones.

12:38.428 --> 12:40.062
You're right.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.498
I won't call her.

12:45.636 --> 12:47.603
Did you say something
about a giant moth?

12:47.604 --> 12:50.139
Nope.

12:51.608 --> 12:53.426
In his underwear?

12:53.427 --> 12:55.711
Danny's been working for me
for two years, but

12:55.712 --> 12:58.414
I just don't know what he'd
have been up to in the park.

12:58.415 --> 12:59.792
He wasn't exactly
the outdoors type.

12:59.887 --> 13:01.370
What about antique guns,
Mr. Murphy?

13:01.371 --> 13:02.807
Do you know anything
about them?

13:02.817 --> 13:05.197
Antiques? No. No,
he wasn't into guns at all.

13:05.489 --> 13:07.557
Well, I understand
that he worked long hours.

13:08.489 --> 13:09.311
Do you know when he left
last night?

13:09.411 --> 13:11.379
Uh, yeah,
right around 9:30.

13:12.256 --> 13:13.333
Oh, hey. Let me help you
with that.

13:13.433 --> 13:15.617
Thanks.
This is Julia Foster, Danny's assistant.

13:15.618 --> 13:17.419
This is Detective Beckett
and Richard Castle.

13:17.420 --> 13:18.854
Hi.
Hi.

13:18.855 --> 13:20.822
Were you here last night
when Goldstein left?

13:20.823 --> 13:24.459
Of course.
Any idea where he was heading?

13:24.705 --> 13:27.641
No, he just said good night.
And what about during the day,

13:27.642 --> 13:29.576
was there anything
out of the ordinary,

13:29.577 --> 13:31.511
any strange phone calls?

13:31.512 --> 13:35.682
No, just the usual
unhappy investor. Although...

13:37.149 --> 13:38.916
Although what?

13:38.917 --> 13:40.418
The Lower Tide Fund.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.311
What's that?

13:41.338 --> 13:43.673
It was one of the financial
products Daniel created for us.

13:43.674 --> 13:46.075
A synthetic C.D.O. cubed.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.077
English?
A really big bet

13:48.078 --> 13:50.146
that prices would return
to historical norms.

13:50.147 --> 13:52.132
So what happened?
It tanked.

13:52.133 --> 13:54.984
Hundreds of millions of dollars
were lost overnight.

13:54.985 --> 13:57.921
When was this?
Three months ago.

13:57.922 --> 13:59.846
There must have been
a lot of angry investors.

13:59.958 --> 14:03.439
We fielded scores of less-than-complimentary
messages from clients.

14:03.626 --> 14:06.628
More like apoplectic,
and a lot of them blamed Danny.

14:06.629 --> 14:08.864
All right, well, I'll need
a copy of all of these messages

14:08.865 --> 14:11.233
and a list of anyone who lost
their money in the fund.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.638
Any luck connecting
antique gun owners

14:16.639 --> 14:18.774
to investors in Goldstein's
failed fund, detectives?

14:18.775 --> 14:21.676
Nah. So far I've seen
a lot of cool, old guns

14:21.677 --> 14:24.062
on these social media sites
for antique gun lovers,

14:24.063 --> 14:27.282
but none of the owners pop
in Goldstein's life.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.984
Irwin "Quick Draw" Finkelstein,

14:28.985 --> 14:30.885
proud owner
of a remington outlaw

14:30.886 --> 14:33.054
made in 1875.

14:33.055 --> 14:34.990
Now that's
a great-looking gun.
Mm-hmm.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.840
Check it out, Esposito.

14:39.493 --> 14:41.127
Yeah, that's nice.

14:41.128 --> 14:43.847
See, back then, they were into
the artistry of it all.

14:43.848 --> 14:46.550
Yeah, they're like little
sculptures that can kill.

14:46.551 --> 14:48.468
Well, this list of
Lower Tide Fund investors,

14:48.469 --> 14:50.444
they all lost more than
a million bucks apiece.

14:50.454 --> 14:51.304
$1 million?
Mm-hmm.

14:51.322 --> 14:53.624
If I had that kind of scratch,
I'd put it in something safe,

14:53.670 --> 14:55.871
like my mattress.
Check it out.

14:55.872 --> 14:57.973
Ivan "Yosemite Sam" Podofski.

14:59.158 --> 15:00.609
Wait a minute.
Ivan Podofski?

15:00.610 --> 15:03.962
Yeah, what do you got?

15:05.798 --> 15:07.232
Boom.

15:07.233 --> 15:10.202
Looks like we have a winner.

15:10.203 --> 15:12.638
You're right. He does kinda
look like Yosemite Sam.

15:12.639 --> 15:14.139
On a bad hair day.

15:14.140 --> 15:15.274
Yeah, well, in addition

15:15.330 --> 15:16.721
to having
an antique gun collection,

15:16.926 --> 15:19.427
Mr. Podofski here lost
more than 4 million bucks

15:19.428 --> 15:20.970
in our vic's Lower Tide Fund.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.580
He also left
this message for Goldstein

15:22.659 --> 15:23.841
the day the fund flatlined.

15:24.751 --> 15:26.793
<i>They had a way of handling</i>
<i>folks like you</i>

15:26.889 --> 15:28.757
<i>in the old country,</i>
<i>Goldstein.</i>

15:28.758 --> 15:31.126
<i>It's called a firing squad.</i>

15:31.967 --> 15:35.869
Do you think he offered him
a blindfold and a cigarette?

15:42.557 --> 15:44.524
<i>They had a way of handling</i>
<i>folks like you</i>

15:44.525 --> 15:46.626
<i>in the old country,</i>
<i>Goldstein.</i>

15:46.627 --> 15:48.428
<i>It's called a firing squad.</i>

15:50.037 --> 15:52.605
I think some context
is in order.

15:52.606 --> 15:55.141
I had only just lost
$4 million.

15:55.142 --> 15:56.676
Yes, and in that context,

15:56.677 --> 15:58.611
you threatened
to kill Mr. Goldstein,

15:58.612 --> 15:59.536
and then he was killed.

15:59.546 --> 16:01.615
Where were you last night
between 11:00 and 1:00?

16:01.816 --> 16:02.908
Asleep in my bed.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.413
And can anyone
vouch for that?

16:04.584 --> 16:07.286
Me.
Myself and I got your back, too?

16:07.287 --> 16:09.221
Okay, look,
I know how this appears.

16:09.222 --> 16:12.591
But I think there's,
uh, an explanation.

16:12.592 --> 16:14.693
Fire away.

16:14.694 --> 16:18.898
Several months ago, I had
a consultation at Berman Rose.

16:18.899 --> 16:21.834
When I mentioned my guns,
Goldstein asked if I knew

16:21.835 --> 16:24.703
how he could get ahold
of a Sherlock Holmes gun.

16:24.704 --> 16:27.940
So you're pointing the finger
at Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?

16:27.941 --> 16:29.842
I'm saying that Goldstein
clearly had an interest

16:29.843 --> 16:31.811
in antique guns.

16:32.552 --> 16:35.022
Maybe that interest
got him killed.

16:35.032 --> 16:36.019
If you're so confident

16:36.119 --> 16:38.020
that Goldstein got mixed up
with someone else,

16:38.021 --> 16:39.955
I'm sure you won't mind
submitting your collection

16:39.956 --> 16:41.523
for testing with ballistics.

16:41.524 --> 16:43.358
These are antiques,
Detective.

16:43.359 --> 16:45.727
Would you prefer
being arrested for murder?

16:48.715 --> 16:51.333
Ballistics has taken
possession of Podofski's guns.

16:51.334 --> 16:52.750
They should have
preliminary results by tomorrow.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.554
They never prefer
to be arrested for murder.

16:54.612 --> 16:57.180
Hmm. All right. Keep at it.
Yeah.

16:57.859 --> 17:00.695
Yo. Just got a hit
from Goldstein's car

17:00.696 --> 17:02.363
from traffic enforcement.

17:02.364 --> 17:04.198
Parking ticket
from last night.

17:04.199 --> 17:06.008
No way.
What?

17:06.132 --> 17:07.887
This has gotta be a joke.
What are you talking about, Castle?

17:08.001 --> 17:10.102
Goldstein drives a DeLorean.

17:10.825 --> 17:13.760
The car used as a time machine
in "Back to the Future"?

17:13.761 --> 17:15.762
There's no way
that's a coincidence.

17:15.762 --> 17:17.664
The ticket was written
at 2:00 in the morning.

17:17.665 --> 17:19.499
That's postmortem.
Car should still be there.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.635
Yeah, East 82nd
between Lex and Third.

17:21.636 --> 17:22.939
That's a few blocks
from the park.

17:22.949 --> 17:24.449
Yeah, but if you're
gonna park illegally,

17:24.545 --> 17:26.512
why not park closer?
Hmm.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.948
Because he was going
somewhere on that block.

17:28.949 --> 17:31.818
Three more parking tickets
in the last several months,

17:31.819 --> 17:33.149
all on 82nd
between Lex and third.

17:33.159 --> 17:35.429
So he was going somewhere
regularly on that block.

17:35.431 --> 17:36.438
Maybe a girlfriend.

17:36.525 --> 17:38.699
Unless you think that's where
that time ripple is.

17:38.871 --> 17:40.972
Could be.

17:40.973 --> 17:42.756
Look into it.
Pick that car up.

17:42.798 --> 17:45.867
Gotcha.

17:48.921 --> 17:51.139
You gotta be kidding me.

17:54.276 --> 17:56.877
Well, it's definitely
Goldstein's car...

17:56.878 --> 17:59.213
Or a... time machine.

17:59.214 --> 18:01.582
Yep. If I'm not mistaken, that's
a flux capacitor in there.

18:01.583 --> 18:04.235
And that
is the reactor core.

18:04.236 --> 18:06.154
Maybe Castle was right.

18:06.155 --> 18:08.256
Goldstein came back
to the future,

18:08.257 --> 18:09.724
and he got whacked, huh?

18:09.725 --> 18:12.226
Why'd he keep coming here?
I don't know.

18:12.227 --> 18:14.228
Maybe there's something
in the car that'll help.

18:14.229 --> 18:16.397
Hope so. Lot of doors
to knock on.

18:16.398 --> 18:18.816
Wow.
Mm.

18:19.736 --> 18:22.421
Yo, Patty. I got a vic's car
that needs towing.

18:22.422 --> 18:25.624
It's at 238 East 82nd.

18:25.625 --> 18:28.277
It's an '81 to '82 DeLorean.

18:28.278 --> 18:31.230
New York plates J-L-D--

18:31.231 --> 18:33.949
Hey, Javi.

18:36.136 --> 18:37.586
Let me call you back.

18:39.083 --> 18:40.601
Excuse us, sir.

18:40.602 --> 18:42.636
I'm Detective Ryan.
This is Detective Esposito.

18:42.729 --> 18:44.048
Do you mind if we
ask you a few questions?

18:44.116 --> 18:46.434
Ah! Top of
the morning to you, constables.

18:46.532 --> 18:48.667
Lord Henry at your service.

18:49.956 --> 18:52.791
Uh, thanks. You mind telling us
where you got those clothes?

18:52.820 --> 18:54.871
Oh, not at all, dear boy.
I picked them up

18:54.872 --> 18:56.790
at the haberdashery
across the park.

18:58.100 --> 18:59.968
Well, gentlemen,
if that is all,

19:00.022 --> 19:01.990
I shall bid you good day.

19:01.991 --> 19:03.192
Just a second, pal.

19:03.238 --> 19:04.748
You know, we think those clothes
might have been involved--

19:04.758 --> 19:06.908
I said "good day."

19:07.106 --> 19:09.007
Sir, we need you to come down--
Good day!

19:09.008 --> 19:10.708
Whoa! Whoa!

19:10.709 --> 19:12.144
Ya! Ya!
Hey!

19:13.596 --> 19:16.181
Ah!

19:16.182 --> 19:17.749
You all right, bro?

19:17.750 --> 19:20.051
You're coming with me.
I'm fine.

19:20.052 --> 19:21.837
Unhand me, you rogue!

19:21.838 --> 19:23.755
All right.
Thank you, Ryan.

19:24.814 --> 19:25.648
How's Esposito?

19:25.744 --> 19:27.211
At home resting.

19:27.212 --> 19:29.180
So our Lord Henry's story
checks out.

19:29.181 --> 19:32.033
Ryan found a matching ascot
in a garbage can

19:32.034 --> 19:34.485
where Henry said
that he found the clothes.

19:34.486 --> 19:38.389
Our guy might be unstable,
but he is not our killer.

19:39.449 --> 19:43.419
So why was Goldstein
wearing this costume?

19:43.420 --> 19:46.105
Well, it's victorian,
antique...

19:46.106 --> 19:48.307
Kind of fits with
the whole time traveler theory,

19:48.308 --> 19:49.775
don't you think?

19:49.776 --> 19:52.695
I don't know what to think,
but the plot thickens.

19:52.696 --> 19:53.656
Forensics came back
on the clothes?

19:53.856 --> 19:56.025
Between the garbage can
and our homeless guy,

19:56.078 --> 19:58.579
there was quite a list
of gross-out substances,

19:58.580 --> 20:00.715
of which I will spare you
the details, but I did find

20:00.716 --> 20:03.050
something interesting
on the right hand glove

20:03.051 --> 20:05.052
and the right sleeve
of the shirt--

20:05.455 --> 20:07.627
potassium,
nitrate and sulfur.

20:07.637 --> 20:09.240
Gunshot residue?

20:09.340 --> 20:11.108
So Goldstein did not
go quietly into the night,

20:11.134 --> 20:13.836
he had a gun.
And he fired back.

20:19.275 --> 20:21.075
I got something here.

20:26.398 --> 20:27.916
Beckett.

20:32.154 --> 20:34.322
Another antique.

20:34.323 --> 20:35.933
Looks exactly like the one
that killed Goldstein.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.308
Yes it does.

20:40.343 --> 20:43.311
Let's say that our killer...

20:43.312 --> 20:45.881
Let's say that our killer
is standing...

20:45.882 --> 20:48.650
Over here.

20:50.636 --> 20:53.021
Goldstein was killed
all the way over there.

20:53.022 --> 20:55.523
A nice flat area
between them.

20:55.524 --> 20:58.493
What are you getting at,
Castle, some kind of game?
Not a game.

20:58.494 --> 21:01.830
Goldstein was wearing formal
turn-of-the-century clothes.

21:01.831 --> 21:04.299
He shot an antique bullet

21:04.300 --> 21:07.185
identical to the one
he was killed with,

21:07.186 --> 21:09.204
probably fired
from an identical gun.

21:09.205 --> 21:10.889
Four, five, six, seven.

21:10.890 --> 21:13.642
Lanie said he was
killed at about midnight?

21:13.643 --> 21:15.677
St. James church
is right over there--

21:15.678 --> 21:17.612
thanks--on Madison.

21:17.613 --> 21:19.614
I bet they could hear
the bells chiming

21:19.615 --> 21:21.483
all the way from over here.

21:21.484 --> 21:24.119
39, 40...

21:24.120 --> 21:25.554
Ish. Ha.

21:25.555 --> 21:28.990
They stood at about 40 paces
from one another.

21:28.991 --> 21:32.210
It wasn't a game.

21:32.211 --> 21:34.296
It was an old-fashioned duel.

22:08.255 --> 22:09.806
Who dares besmirch...

22:09.807 --> 22:11.158
Oh, God, don't shoot!
My honor?

22:11.240 --> 22:12.557
It's okay, Ashley.
He's not gonna shoot you.

22:12.613 --> 22:14.714
What the heck, dad?!

22:15.686 --> 22:17.954
I might be asking you
the same...

22:17.955 --> 22:19.756
Ashley?
This is Ashley?

22:19.757 --> 22:21.708
Ash, this is my dad, Rick.

22:21.709 --> 22:23.759
And I have no idea
why he's waving a gun.

22:23.769 --> 22:25.477
So nice to meet you,
Mr. Castle.

22:25.512 --> 22:26.279
You, too, Ashley,

22:26.306 --> 22:29.008
and I have a perfectly good
reason why I'm waving a gun.

22:29.009 --> 22:30.559
Excuse us.

22:32.579 --> 22:34.547
Explain yourself.

22:35.907 --> 22:38.208
I got this gun
for research for a case,

22:38.209 --> 22:40.378
which you might know if you
had checked in with me today.

22:40.452 --> 22:41.152
What's that supposed to mean?

22:41.162 --> 22:43.537
Let's just say, one of us
has nothing to hide.

22:43.924 --> 22:45.400
Perhaps you'd like
to explain yourself?

22:45.410 --> 22:46.462
What, that I was
kissing a boy?

22:46.638 --> 22:48.772
Is that a problem?
You tell me.

22:50.279 --> 22:52.448
Dad, the only reason
I invited Ashley over tonight

22:52.457 --> 22:53.524
was so you could meet him.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.207
Yes, well, me meeting Ashley

22:55.208 --> 22:57.509
has smeared the lip gloss
all over your face.

22:57.510 --> 23:00.179
Uh, I-I-I really
should be going.

23:00.180 --> 23:03.182
You can stay, Ashley.

23:03.183 --> 23:04.783
Oh, the gun.

23:05.729 --> 23:07.297
My bad.

23:07.298 --> 23:10.133
Please, Ashley, stay.

23:10.134 --> 23:13.236
You can check out the gun.
No, thanks.

23:13.237 --> 23:15.642
Call me later?
Yeah, if it's okay with your gun...

23:16.553 --> 23:17.854
Dad.

23:17.856 --> 23:19.606
Yeah, it's okay with me.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.075
Thank you.

23:21.076 --> 23:23.594
And I-I-I just want you to know
how much I respect Alexis.

23:23.679 --> 23:25.568
I mean, you don't have to worry
about issues of respect.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.428
She's probably the most
respectable person I know,

23:27.528 --> 23:29.563
and I-I respect you, too.

23:31.800 --> 23:34.134
That's good to know that.

23:34.135 --> 23:36.036
Thank you.

23:45.814 --> 23:47.881
I like him.

23:47.882 --> 23:49.917
He's respectful.

23:58.460 --> 24:00.327
Got it. Thanks.

24:00.328 --> 24:01.995
Hey.

24:01.996 --> 24:05.357
Hey. So Ivan Podofski's antique
gun collection all cleared ballistics.

24:06.218 --> 24:07.368
Well, at least some guy
in ballistics

24:07.406 --> 24:09.541
had fun firing 'em off.
Hmm.

24:10.296 --> 24:13.232
I also checked with Goldstein's
sister and coworkers.

24:13.315 --> 24:15.834
None of them know anything about
duels or victorian clothes

24:15.857 --> 24:18.808
or what Goldstein was doing
on East 82nd.

24:18.809 --> 24:20.977
Sounds like he had
a secret life.

24:20.978 --> 24:23.447
That somehow led to a duel.

24:24.793 --> 24:27.027
Maybe he figured someone
besmirched his honor.

24:27.028 --> 24:29.463
Maybe it was about a girl.
Matter of fact, Alexis,

24:29.464 --> 24:32.199
her new boyfriend--who has
a girl's name, by the way--

24:32.200 --> 24:34.585
he thought I was gonna
shoot him last night.

24:34.586 --> 24:36.570
Hey.
Hey. How's Esposito?

24:36.571 --> 24:38.212
He's sleeping in,
mostly because he can't move.

24:38.541 --> 24:40.462
Did you figure out what Goldstein
was doing on East 82nd?

24:40.472 --> 24:42.293
No, but get this. I'm going
through Goldstein's car,

24:42.294 --> 24:44.227
and I find a pile of receipts
he must have been planning

24:44.228 --> 24:45.662
to submit for reimbursement,

24:45.663 --> 24:48.098
one of 'em from three weeks ago
at a cafÃ©.

24:48.099 --> 24:51.468
On it, he wrote
"coffee with Troy Kenworth,"

24:51.587 --> 24:53.384
and that name
kinda rings a bell.

24:53.484 --> 24:55.536
One of the angry
Lower Tide Fund investors?

24:55.592 --> 24:57.526
No, but his father
Charles Kenworth was.

24:57.527 --> 24:59.711
Guy loses 2 million bucks,

24:59.712 --> 25:01.897
and then he loses his house,
his marriage,

25:01.898 --> 25:04.241
and then two months ago,
he killed himself.

25:04.251 --> 25:05.981
Did Troy have any priors?

25:06.130 --> 25:07.597
Yeah, more like afters.

25:07.598 --> 25:09.232
After his father
committed suicide,

25:09.233 --> 25:11.702
he was charged with assault
in four separate bar fights.

25:11.703 --> 25:14.504
Revenge... oldest motive
for murder in the book.

25:14.505 --> 25:17.374
Maybe Troy thought someone
besmirched his father's honor.

25:17.375 --> 25:21.178
And then he forced Goldstein
to settle the score.

25:21.179 --> 25:23.447
<i>Yeah, I was the one</i>
<i>who found his body.</i>

25:23.448 --> 25:27.200
<i>The report says</i>
<i>that he used a shotgun.</i>

25:27.201 --> 25:29.619
Hey.

25:30.590 --> 25:32.558
Why aren't you in there?

25:32.559 --> 25:34.828
Beckett's doing
a mothering thing.

25:34.875 --> 25:36.809
Wanted to limit
the testosterone on the room.

25:36.810 --> 25:39.779
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>walking in on that.</i>

25:39.780 --> 25:41.180
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:42.023 --> 25:44.925
<i>Pretty messy.</i>
<i>I try not to think about it.</i>

25:44.926 --> 25:46.794
<i>I understand.</i>

25:46.795 --> 25:48.762
But since then, Mr. Kenworth,

25:48.763 --> 25:51.698
you have charges pending
in four assault cases.

25:51.699 --> 25:53.801
I started drinking too much,
lashed out.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.736
But those were just
random people at bars.

25:55.737 --> 25:58.071
I mean, they weren't even
responsible

25:58.072 --> 25:59.373
for your father's suicide.

25:59.411 --> 26:01.412
But Goldstein...

26:02.850 --> 26:04.245
He put your father
in the fund

26:04.252 --> 26:05.487
that lost him
all of his money.

26:05.541 --> 26:07.708
I could understand
blaming him.

26:07.709 --> 26:10.244
I did, but then
I talked to him, and he said

26:10.245 --> 26:11.979
that he warned pop
to diversify.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.915
And the fact is,
dad and mom

26:13.916 --> 26:15.483
have been having problems
for years.

26:15.534 --> 26:17.769
When we lost the house,
and I had to drop out of school,

26:17.868 --> 26:19.802
it was the last straw,
and mom left him.

26:19.803 --> 26:21.538
That's what pushed him
over the edge,

26:21.581 --> 26:23.516
and ever since his death,
mom's been struggling

26:23.579 --> 26:25.032
to make payments
on our apartment.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.777
Is that why you went to go
see Goldstein three weeks ago?

26:28.159 --> 26:30.557
I wanted to find out if any
money was left in the account.

26:30.567 --> 26:31.956
And what did Goldstein
tell you?

26:32.056 --> 26:34.087
The truth.
All the money's gone.

26:34.486 --> 26:35.926
Well, that must have
made you pretty angry.

26:36.101 --> 26:38.036
Okay, I know
what you're getting at,

26:38.037 --> 26:40.671
but that meeting
is what turned me around.

26:40.849 --> 26:41.916
I haven't had a drink since,

26:41.952 --> 26:43.524
mom and I have been able
to stay in our place.

26:43.705 --> 26:45.706
I might even go back to school
next semester.

26:45.707 --> 26:48.643
All because Danny's a stand-up
guy, and he gave me a job.

26:48.644 --> 26:50.599
That's where I was
the night he got killed.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.810
At Berman Rose?

26:54.375 --> 26:55.377
Uh, no.

26:55.541 --> 26:57.309
What kind of a job
did Danny give you?

26:57.319 --> 26:58.460
I can't say.

26:58.511 --> 27:00.679
Look, I had to sign
a confidentiality agreement.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.248
Okay? I could be fired.
Or you could be arrested.

27:03.249 --> 27:05.650
Is this job on 82nd
between Lex and Third?

27:20.869 --> 27:23.187
What was the exact number
of pounds that Mr. Fogg bet

27:23.188 --> 27:25.238
that he could travel
around the world in 80 days?

27:25.239 --> 27:27.007
20,000.
Correct, sir.

27:27.050 --> 27:29.552
Name the volcano that led
to the center of the Earth.

27:29.553 --> 27:31.154
Oh, I want to say--

27:31.155 --> 27:33.556
NYPD. Open the damn door.

27:37.327 --> 27:40.079
âª The sound of the foghorn,
it tears me from my sleep âª

27:40.080 --> 27:42.331
âª I'm much too tired
for the waking âª

27:42.332 --> 27:44.066
âª but too wired
for the sheep âª

27:44.067 --> 27:46.652
âª and the anvil's
on the table âª

27:46.653 --> 27:49.505
âª the sword is on the door,
it's time to pick up... âª

27:49.506 --> 27:51.808
Hello!

27:51.809 --> 27:54.610
Where are we?
Victorian London.

27:54.611 --> 27:57.713
When are we?
1892.

28:00.163 --> 28:01.332
What is this place?

28:01.412 --> 28:04.714
The Gaslamp League,
a private steampunk society.

28:04.715 --> 28:06.182
Straight ahead

28:06.183 --> 28:08.118
you'll find our club president,
Owen Peterson.

28:08.119 --> 28:11.171
He's on the penny-farthing.

28:11.172 --> 28:12.939
All right then.

28:12.940 --> 28:14.925
âª And empty the contents
of your purse âª

28:14.926 --> 28:17.761
âª me and you, Watson,
me and you... âª

28:17.762 --> 28:20.447
Oh, it's the time machine
from "Time and Away."

28:20.448 --> 28:22.449
I love that movie.
Owen!

28:22.450 --> 28:23.950
Give us a poem!

28:23.951 --> 28:25.569
Steampunk.

28:25.570 --> 28:27.554
It's a subculture
that embraces

28:27.555 --> 28:29.539
the simplicity and romance
of the past

28:29.540 --> 28:32.642
at the same time, couples it
with the hope and promise

28:32.643 --> 28:35.679
and sheer super-coolness
of futuristic design.

28:35.680 --> 28:38.298
You're cloned, you say?
There are more of you?

28:38.299 --> 28:40.383
Well, the more the merrier!

28:40.384 --> 28:42.318
To ewes all, I'll be true.

28:47.591 --> 28:48.551
Excuse me, Mr. Peterson.
I'm Detective--

28:48.561 --> 28:50.381
Can I try that?

28:50.527 --> 28:52.261
Ah.

28:52.262 --> 28:54.162
I don't know
what to tell you, Detective.

28:54.163 --> 28:56.432
We all heard about Danny
yesterday. Hard to believe.

28:56.433 --> 28:57.466
We saw him here
the night before.

28:57.835 --> 28:59.570
Well, the way you and your
friends were yukking it up

28:59.727 --> 29:01.389
makes me feel like
you weren't so upset.

29:01.496 --> 29:02.930
We're just romantics,
Detective.

29:02.931 --> 29:04.781
Look at the world,
don't like what we see,

29:04.782 --> 29:05.866
so we recreate it here--

29:05.890 --> 29:08.659
an oasis where human potential
and ingenuity is limitless,

29:08.660 --> 29:12.095
where there's poetry and wonder
and meaning, even in death.

29:13.103 --> 29:14.139
What time did he leave that night?

29:14.149 --> 29:15.549
Around 11:30.

29:15.827 --> 29:17.193
Did he tell you
what he was doing?

29:17.203 --> 29:18.123
No.

29:18.163 --> 29:20.397
He went to the park
for a duel.

29:21.087 --> 29:22.104
What do you mean, a duel?

29:22.114 --> 29:23.946
The kind where people
shoot at each other.

29:24.380 --> 29:26.315
They were using
antique guns.

29:26.316 --> 29:29.384
Do you know anything
about that?

29:34.891 --> 29:36.858
Dueling pistols.

29:36.859 --> 29:39.594
With, uh, lead balls

29:39.595 --> 29:42.064
with white coating?

29:47.704 --> 29:50.405
This has been fired
recently.

29:50.406 --> 29:53.392
But they're just for show.

29:54.977 --> 29:57.029
Adam, stop! Stop!

29:57.030 --> 29:59.398
Oh, my God! Oh!
Oh, goodness!

30:01.818 --> 30:03.951
Out of the way!
Get out of the way!

30:03.961 --> 30:05.321
I think he's going
for the time machine!

30:06.650 --> 30:07.451
It's just a bunch
of interviews.

30:07.506 --> 30:08.908
I don't know why you didn't
take the whole day off.

30:08.987 --> 30:10.938
Because I'm fine.

30:10.939 --> 30:12.339
Murphy!

30:12.340 --> 30:14.608
Stop him!

30:14.609 --> 30:17.361
Oh! Oh! Ow! Aah!

30:23.441 --> 30:25.108
Hey, Esposito.

30:25.109 --> 30:26.926
How's your neck?

30:34.835 --> 30:37.303
Yeah, I shot him.

30:37.304 --> 30:39.572
He just kinda
crumpled over backwards,

30:39.573 --> 30:41.574
but I thought he was kidding.

30:41.575 --> 30:44.443
I jogged over expecting him
to jump up any second,

30:44.444 --> 30:46.879
but he was just--
just lying there so still,

30:46.880 --> 30:49.115
a-and then I saw the blood,
and I hear Julia.

30:49.116 --> 30:51.017
She's on her knees screaming,
"no. Please, God, no."

30:51.018 --> 30:52.451
I-I-I freaked out.

30:53.113 --> 30:54.948
We took his clothes,
and--and I just ran.

30:54.949 --> 30:57.250
Julia? You mean
Goldstein's assistant?

30:57.251 --> 30:58.718
He was in love with her.

30:58.719 --> 31:00.654
Had they been seeing each other
a long time?

31:00.680 --> 31:02.614
No, no,
Dan just kissed her once,

31:02.615 --> 31:04.583
a couple weeks ago
out at a bar,

31:04.584 --> 31:06.798
but she--she wasn't interested
in him.

31:06.808 --> 31:08.180
So you were involved with her?

31:08.558 --> 31:10.526
Not really involved,

31:10.527 --> 31:12.762
but Dan caught us
fooling around in my office

31:12.763 --> 31:14.363
late one night last week.

31:14.364 --> 31:16.465
And you couldn't think of
a better way of settling this

31:16.475 --> 31:17.260
other than a duel?

31:17.270 --> 31:18.558
We--we--we just thought
it would be funny.

31:18.778 --> 31:20.210
Danny swore
that we couldn't get hurt.

31:20.220 --> 31:20.951
Shooting at each other?

31:21.030 --> 31:22.897
He--he ran
all these complex equations.

31:22.898 --> 31:25.367
He said--said that at 40 paces,
there was no chance

31:25.368 --> 31:27.769
that we could actually hit
each other, something about

31:27.770 --> 31:30.555
18th century guns having
no rifling in the barrel.

31:30.556 --> 31:31.807
So if you couldn't
kill each other,

31:31.809 --> 31:33.743
what was the point
of the duel?

31:35.605 --> 31:37.339
To impress Julia.

31:37.340 --> 31:39.776
She would never
get serious with geeks like us.

31:39.805 --> 31:42.674
But we figured that maybe if--
if she saw us duel over her,

31:44.368 --> 31:48.404
then...
Maybe that one--that one of--

31:48.405 --> 31:51.708
one of us c--

31:57.414 --> 31:58.482
Julia confirmed that she was

31:58.549 --> 32:00.383
the only other person
present at the duel.

32:00.405 --> 32:01.839
No one else knew.

32:01.840 --> 32:03.341
All right. Let her go.

32:06.462 --> 32:08.379
How do you point
the gun at someone

32:08.380 --> 32:10.348
and shoot
and not expect to kill them?

32:10.349 --> 32:12.167
Well, they were blinded by
the romance of it all,

32:12.197 --> 32:13.498
and Goldstein did the math.

32:13.586 --> 32:15.554
Well, between this
and the Lower Tide Fund,

32:15.555 --> 32:17.422
maybe he wasn't such a genius.

32:17.423 --> 32:19.075
Or maybe
he's just unlucky.

32:19.085 --> 32:20.667
Well, then I've got a problem,

32:21.010 --> 32:23.412
because I have to make
a recommendation to the D.A.

32:23.413 --> 32:24.747
Between murder
and manslaughter,

32:24.755 --> 32:26.689
the difference being
life in prison

32:26.690 --> 32:29.894
or just a couple of years.

32:30.441 --> 32:33.276
I mean, are antique guns
really so inaccurate?

32:35.146 --> 32:37.814
Only one way to find out.

32:48.459 --> 32:49.826
âª Kiss kiss âª

32:49.827 --> 32:52.078
âª bang bang kiss kiss âª

32:52.079 --> 32:54.264
that's your target.
That's my target.

32:54.265 --> 32:55.732
Yeah, well, I--

32:55.733 --> 32:58.034
shoot your target.

32:58.035 --> 32:59.836
âª Bang bang âª

32:59.837 --> 33:01.705
âª kiss kiss âª

33:18.756 --> 33:20.757

33:28.232 --> 33:30.634

33:33.571 --> 33:35.939
âª

33:37.441 --> 33:38.941
Manslaughter it is.

33:38.942 --> 33:40.943
Yeah.

33:40.944 --> 33:45.080
âª

33:49.653 --> 33:51.237
Hey, dad.

33:53.440 --> 33:55.374
Hey, there's my girl.

33:55.375 --> 33:56.876
Come here.

33:56.877 --> 33:58.544
Hey.

33:58.545 --> 34:00.263
Mm. Oh, um...

34:00.264 --> 34:02.431
Sorry. Hang on.

34:02.432 --> 34:04.684
Okay. There we go.

34:05.869 --> 34:07.920
Hey, about, uh, last night,

34:07.921 --> 34:10.639
um, I was...
It was unexpected.

34:10.641 --> 34:12.842
Yeah.
I'm--I'm sorry.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.945
I'm sorry, too. I should've
told you Ashley was a boy.

34:15.946 --> 34:19.016
No, why, uh,
why spoil the surprise?

34:19.246 --> 34:21.002
So I have a question
for you,

34:21.003 --> 34:22.937
but it's
a little embarrassing.

34:22.938 --> 34:24.717
Ooh. I love
when you embarrass yourself.

34:24.726 --> 34:25.847
Dad.

34:27.319 --> 34:29.771
Well, hey, listen,
you can, uh...

34:29.860 --> 34:31.911
You can ask me
whatever you want,

34:31.913 --> 34:34.114
and... I promise,
I'll do my best

34:34.114 --> 34:36.784
to make it as unembarrassing
as possible.

34:38.579 --> 34:40.563
How do you know
when you're in love?

34:40.563 --> 34:42.148
I know it's an emotion...

34:42.149 --> 34:44.551
Well--
a feeling, and you can't exactly define,

34:44.552 --> 34:46.652
like, technically, how you know
when you're feeling it,

34:46.654 --> 34:48.588
but since
I've never felt it before,

34:48.589 --> 34:50.572
how do I know what I'm feeling
is even it at all?

34:50.574 --> 34:52.509
Except, of course,
for the fact

34:52.510 --> 34:55.128
that I'm feeling all these
things I've never felt before,

34:55.129 --> 34:57.164
like in my stomach and my throat
and even kind of in my ears.

34:57.254 --> 35:00.889
I mean, which just has to mean
that it's love, right?

35:00.978 --> 35:03.112
Considering I only feel them
when I'm with Ashley

35:03.113 --> 35:04.680
or thinking about him,

35:04.681 --> 35:06.982
I mean,
that's gotta be love, right?

35:06.983 --> 35:09.585
If--
'cause I'm feeling all these
things I've read about in poems

35:09.586 --> 35:11.704
and heard about in songs
but never completely understood,

35:11.705 --> 35:13.790
but now I do. I understand.
And I'm listening

35:13.791 --> 35:15.725
to all this music
and reading all this poetry

35:15.726 --> 35:17.693
in a completely new
and glorious light,

35:17.694 --> 35:19.662
which I think just has to mean
that it's love.

35:19.663 --> 35:21.364
What do you think?
I--

35:21.365 --> 35:24.300
I can't stop thinking about him,
daddy. I don't even want to,

35:24.301 --> 35:26.702
'cause he's the greatest,
sweetest, most adorable guy,

35:26.703 --> 35:30.272
and his nose crinkles when he
laughs, and I'm just so happy.

35:32.376 --> 35:35.478
Thanks, dad.
I love you.

35:37.748 --> 35:39.682
I feel so much better now.

35:45.763 --> 35:47.131
I'm glad we had that talk.

35:50.214 --> 35:51.548
Beckett.

35:51.549 --> 35:54.017
How do you know
when you're in love?

35:54.018 --> 35:56.320
All the songs make sense.

35:59.357 --> 36:01.692
Adam Murphy
didn't kill Goldstein.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.193
But he confessed.

36:03.194 --> 36:06.363
And I believe that he believes
he did it, but he didn't.

36:06.364 --> 36:08.749
Do tell.
It bothered me

36:08.750 --> 36:12.169
that we couldn't hit the target
at the shooting range,

36:12.170 --> 36:14.604
and so I ran ballistics
on the dueling pistols.

36:14.605 --> 36:16.590
The bullet
that hit Daniel Goldstein

36:16.591 --> 36:18.608
didn't match
either one of them.

36:18.609 --> 36:20.677
Adam couldn't
have killed him.

36:20.678 --> 36:24.047
You're talking full-on,
grassy knoll conspiracy theory.

36:24.048 --> 36:25.582
Not theory, fact.

36:25.583 --> 36:28.418
There was a third shooter,
and that's our killer.

36:40.184 --> 36:41.332
Hey, Beckett!

36:43.020 --> 36:44.320
Did you find
Adam Murphy's bullet?

36:44.518 --> 36:45.985
Lead ball.

36:45.986 --> 36:47.921
Yep.
He didn't kill Goldstein.

36:47.922 --> 36:50.757
But he did kill squirrelstein.

36:53.227 --> 36:55.061
What are the odds, huh?

36:55.062 --> 36:57.730
Oh, no.
They took his clothes, too.

36:57.731 --> 36:59.599
Could you?
Aww.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.651
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

37:05.129 --> 37:07.631
Okay, so we know that Goldstein
was standing right over here...

37:07.866 --> 37:09.484
Facing Adam,
who was right over there.

37:09.544 --> 37:12.363
Right, and if our killer
wanted to shoot him

37:12.364 --> 37:14.315
without either of them
seeing him,

37:14.316 --> 37:17.684
he would be standing
right over...

37:18.767 --> 37:21.302
There,
by that clump of trees.

37:25.124 --> 37:27.842
Detective,
I've got clothing fibers.

37:28.057 --> 37:31.192
Right where a shooter
would brace himself.

37:31.193 --> 37:32.978
This thread look familiar?

37:32.979 --> 37:34.996
Oh, I'd recognize
that burgundy velvet anywhere.

37:34.997 --> 37:36.965
Kinda says "steampunk,"
doesn't it?

37:36.966 --> 37:38.684
Matter of fact,

37:38.685 --> 37:40.869
I think I know
the murder weapon.

37:40.870 --> 37:43.789
Volcano in "Journey to
the Center of the Earth"--

37:43.790 --> 37:45.140
Snaefells?

37:45.141 --> 37:46.258
Castle.

37:49.996 --> 37:52.915
Couldn't stay away, huh?
Can I get you guys something?

37:52.916 --> 37:54.349
Sure, Troy.

37:54.350 --> 37:56.151
We're looking for a shooter.

37:56.152 --> 37:57.986
Actually, I think
we already found one.

37:57.987 --> 37:59.421
Nice uniform, by the way.

37:59.422 --> 38:01.256
We found
your father's shotgun.

38:01.257 --> 38:02.725
We know that you modified it

38:02.754 --> 38:04.755
in order to shoot
antique lead ball bullets.

38:04.780 --> 38:05.947
What are you talking about?

38:06.039 --> 38:07.640
Adam Murphy already confessed
right?

38:08.336 --> 38:10.237
Turns out Adam Murphy
couldn't have done it.

38:10.238 --> 38:12.718
It's a sciencey
ballistics thing.

38:12.968 --> 38:15.603
It was pretty clever,
firing your father's shotgun

38:15.604 --> 38:18.506
at the exact moment that Adam
and Goldstein fired their guns.

38:18.507 --> 38:19.974
Making Adam believe

38:19.975 --> 38:21.177
that he was the one
that killed Goldstein,

38:21.181 --> 38:23.048
right as the church bells
chimed midnight.

38:24.186 --> 38:27.355
Isn't that right?

38:27.356 --> 38:30.325
<i>âª</i>

38:33.429 --> 38:35.363
Seeing him in here
every night

38:35.364 --> 38:38.366
in that ridiculous outfit...

38:38.367 --> 38:41.052
Just throwing around
all that money?

38:41.053 --> 38:42.987
Why should he
get to live like that

38:42.988 --> 38:44.906
when my dad's dead?

38:49.129 --> 38:51.639
Knowing that our shooter
was a staff member at the club

38:51.649 --> 38:53.217
lead us straight back to Troy.

38:53.227 --> 38:55.447
He overheard Goldstein and Murphy
planning the duel,

38:55.535 --> 38:57.903
and took his opportunity.
And then Troy's alibi fell apart

38:57.904 --> 38:59.772
as soon as we started
interviewing other staff members

38:59.773 --> 39:01.707
who couldn't remember
seeing him there

39:01.708 --> 39:03.643
half an hour before
or after the duel.

39:03.644 --> 39:05.911
Dueling over a girl, avenging
the death of a loved one...

39:05.912 --> 39:07.166
Cuts to the heart
of romance.

39:07.176 --> 39:08.553
And the tragedy.

39:08.730 --> 39:11.365
Speaking of tragedy, did you
hear about Detective Esposito?

39:11.366 --> 39:13.867
No. What about him?

You have my undivided attention.

41:35.974 --> 41:38.376

to go on a date tonight.

41:38.377 --> 41:39.844

my go-to guy.

41:50.865 --> 41:53.734
Did gram put you up to this?

41:53.735 --> 41:57.471
I have no idea

41:57.472 --> 41:59.206
Pity date.
