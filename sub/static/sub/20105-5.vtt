<i>LIV: Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.544 --> 00:04.410
I found an interesting post
from a zombie-hater.

00:04.630 --> 00:05.461
<i>Harley Johns.</i>

00:05.672 --> 00:07.959
<i>His online signature links

00:11.553 --> 00:12.259
Let's get up and running.

00:12.471 --> 00:13.962
We don't have
any customers yet.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.137
Make some then.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.762
I've developed a serum
that could potentially undo

00:17.976 --> 00:20.889
<i>the memory loss that accompanies
the second zombie cure.</i>

00:21.104 --> 00:22.595
<i>RAVI: The serum is
completely ineffective.</i>

00:22.814 --> 00:24.601
<i>It won't be long
before you have an episode</i>

00:24.816 --> 00:26.148
too severe
for that inhaler to help.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.693
This is the real deal!
With real bullets!

00:28.904 --> 00:31.396
So, let's make sure they
do not leave you real dead!

00:34.368 --> 00:36.451
(GUNFIRE)

00:36.662 --> 00:38.494
It appears we've lost
the element of surprise.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.072
Thanks for the intel,
Captain Obvious.

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

00:43.835 --> 00:44.825
You gonna live?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.252
Affirmative.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.501
All right. Time's a wastin'.
There's hostages in there

00:52.719 --> 00:53.835
who aren't gonna
rescue themselves.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.465
Chug 'em if
you've got 'em, boys.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.681
We've gotta take that rooftop.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.394
Cover me.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.492
If we make it out of here,

01:18.745 --> 01:20.361
I'm transferring
to accounting.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.617
See you on the rooftop.

01:21.790 --> 01:22.746
Yeah.

You okay, man?

01:58.660 --> 02:00.196
Yeah, just a flesh wound.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.241
Thirty-five flesh wounds.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.604
When Major gets back
from his mission,

02:32.819 --> 02:33.684
I'll have to break
the news to him

02:33.904 --> 02:36.692
that the memory restoration
serum didn't work for Blaine.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.398
When Major takes the cure,

02:38.950 --> 02:40.066
he's going
to forget everything.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.151
What's Major doing
going on a mission?

02:42.371 --> 02:43.361
He shouldn't be leaving town.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.074
He could die any day.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.781
Well, he's got one
of our cure syringes.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.866
If he gets too bad,
he can inject himself.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.247
CLIVE: New case.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.711
I need to get your thoughts.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.371
Don't know how this works yet?

02:53.590 --> 02:56.378
As a general rule, I require
a dead body and a brain.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.333
She's right.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.420
We tend to meet you at what's
called a "crime scene," and then...

03:00.639 --> 03:02.175
The murder occurred
two weeks ago.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.425
It was Percy's case, but he's out
for a month with a back injury.

03:05.644 --> 03:06.760
Now it's mine.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.520
Vic's name was Roxanne Greer.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.431
Caucasian female in her 30s.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.061
Strangulation.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.187
Right.

03:14.403 --> 03:17.020
Sorry, Clive.
Roxanne Greer was cremated.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.361
No brain.

03:18.782 --> 03:19.818
Actually...

03:21.827 --> 03:23.034
I'm not putting that
in my mouth.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.362
The memory restoration serum
had no effect on Blaine.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.741
Blaine's human, I'm not.

03:26.915 --> 03:27.871
But that's not my problem.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.242
It's the color, right?
Blue isn't appetizing.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.121
She was a dominatrix, Ravi.

03:32.337 --> 03:35.205
A dominatrix who went by
the name Sweet Lady Pain.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.255
Oh, that?

03:36.466 --> 03:37.798
You're already a bit
on the bossy side,

03:38.009 --> 03:39.295
I doubt anyone
would even notice.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.592
Remember where we found her?

03:40.929 --> 03:44.764
In her dungeon, surrounded by freaky
sex toys and strangled by her own whip.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.432
Does that sound fun to you?

03:49.438 --> 03:50.053

03:50.439 --> 03:51.850
Here's the problem.
Detective Percy

03:52.065 --> 03:54.523
was certain Roxanne was
murdered by a client, but...

03:54.735 --> 03:56.226
You don't know
who her clients were.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.482
We needs visions, Liv.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.070
I'll get the frying pan.

Crawl over here, piggie,
and bring me my gloves.

04:22.220 --> 04:22.880
No.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.254
Someone's asking
to be punished.

04:25.474 --> 04:26.555
Is it you?

04:27.434 --> 04:28.140
Here.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.351
I thought so.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.894
This is where you end up when your
parents don't tell you they love you.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.354
Don't be so close-minded.

04:41.573 --> 04:45.066
A control freak like you could enjoy
being told what to do for a change.

Do you have
any fantasy life at all?

04:57.088 --> 04:58.204

04:58.423 --> 05:00.085
- People ate in here?
- Big whoop.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.633
Half my meals
are consumed in a morgue.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.086
You know that window up there,
Percy says in his notes

05:05.305 --> 05:07.297
that he thinks
the killer broke in that way.

05:07.516 --> 05:08.848
Why didn't she hear him?

05:09.434 --> 05:10.299
Don't know.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.191
A remote.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.359
I wonder what it controls.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.071
You see anything vibrating?

05:26.243 --> 05:27.233
Spy-Tech.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.819
You see a camera anywhere?

05:37.921 --> 05:39.002
Not a camera.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.251
That's a camera lens.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.181
The memory card is missing.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.679
What if the killer learned
his session was being taped,

05:55.897 --> 05:58.731
strangled Roxanne, and took
the memory card with him?

05:58.984 --> 06:00.441
Why does he break the window?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.446
Please try this on for me.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.517
I just saw D.A. Baracus.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.979
As in the zombie running
for mayor of Seattle.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.115
He was strapped to that bed,
begging Roxanne to whip him.

the whip is in the other hand.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.083
You sure it was him?

07:03.298 --> 07:04.254
Positive.

07:04.466 --> 07:05.547
This vision was different.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.507
Longer. Cleaner.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.006
Something about Ravi's blue
juice made it extra potent.

07:10.221 --> 07:11.712
Good. That's what we need.

07:11.932 --> 07:15.221
Let's pay Baracus a visit on the campaign
trail tomorrow and get him to talk.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.473

Qumarian separatists

for the good guys.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.342
Yeah.

The outfit's a bit much,
that's all I'm saying.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.553
I didn't ask.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.851
- There's Baracus.
- It's the best fries in town.

that image in my mind.

was a Hallmark movie

in comparison to the visions
I had last night.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.778

it kept me up all night.

anything triggering them.

Seattle not seeing Sweet Lady Pain.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.078
Yeah, but I don't recognize
any of them.

you forget them.

I owe this pleasure?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.766
Oh, sorry.

Down on all fours.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.113
- Lick it up.
- Excuse me?

09:34.657 --> 09:35.693
Why don't we talk in private.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.157
Yeah. Let's.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.155
What about my boot?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.539
Sorry to interrupt
your campaigning,

09:43.750 --> 09:45.833
but we're looking into
the murder of Roxanne Greer.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.627
- Who?
- You knew her as Sweet Lady Pain.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.964
I don't think I'm
familiar with... (CHUCKLES)

09:52.175 --> 09:54.633
I ate her brain and had a vision
of you wearing a gimp mask.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.801
You told Lady Pain
you were a bed-wetting,

09:57.013 --> 10:00.427
thumb-sucking liar
and unworthy of your success.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.136
Think that'll fit
on a bumper sticker?

10:02.310 --> 10:04.222
That's just two
consenting adults...

10:04.437 --> 10:05.769
Don't apologize.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.263
It's pathetic.

10:07.482 --> 10:08.848
So what happened?

10:09.025 --> 10:11.267
Did you discover the hidden
camera, lose your cool?

10:12.320 --> 10:13.436
There was a hidden camera?

10:13.863 --> 10:16.480
Wait! Are you asking me
if I murdered Sweet Lady...

10:17.033 --> 10:20.026
- Miss Greer?
- She was murdered on the evening of the 25th.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.319
Do you remember
your whereabouts that evening?

10:24.457 --> 10:25.368
Ah...

10:26.209 --> 10:27.666
I was at
a campaign fundraiser.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.665
So there must have been dozens of
donors present that can confirm it.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.255
Why don't you
just give me a few?

10:35.009 --> 10:36.216
(EXHALES)

10:36.427 --> 10:38.214
You want me to do
nine different sketches?

10:38.429 --> 10:40.796
Did you see the starting lineup
of a baseball team murder someone?

10:41.057 --> 10:44.095
I'm assisting Detective Babineaux
with a murder investigation.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.389
An anonymous witness
sent me Snapchats

10:46.604 --> 10:49.392
with photos they took
of possible suspects.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.441
As soon as I open the images,
they disappear.

10:52.694 --> 10:53.901
You could've saved us
both a lot of time

10:54.070 --> 10:55.186
if you'd just
screen-grabbed the images.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.113
When I want your advice,
I'll beat it out of you.

10:58.449 --> 11:02.033
Now be a good little sketch
bitch and pick up that pad.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.281
Excuse me?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.283
Oh, I think you heard me,
Jimmy.

11:05.790 --> 11:09.283
I think you hear me
loud and clear.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.078
Pick up the pad.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.162
Okay.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.584
- Suspect number one.
- Yeah.

11:21.264 --> 11:23.301
- Suspect number six.
- (SIGHING)

11:23.516 --> 11:25.883
Dimple chin, high cheekbones,

11:26.603 --> 11:28.560
barbells in each
of his nipples.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.605
This is kind of a
"from the neck up" situation.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.730
Draw the nipples, Jimmy.

11:35.987 --> 11:38.149
Elevating my blood sugar levels
might help me work faster.

11:38.615 --> 11:39.696
I brought my lunch.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.149
- Two bites.
- It's soup.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.199
Then two swallows.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.110
Okay.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.419
ROXANNE: Harder!

11:55.131 --> 11:56.247
Look at this.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.503
It's as filthy as you are.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.799
Please,

12:00.011 --> 12:02.378
do not punish me,
Sweet Lady Pain.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.929
Punish me. Punish me hard.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.006
Ah!

12:06.226 --> 12:07.683
I'll rub it until it's shiny!

12:08.478 --> 12:09.764
I'll rub it until it's shiny!

12:11.356 --> 12:13.473
(PANTING)

12:15.902 --> 12:18.064
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.271
That's right, you didn't.

12:21.616 --> 12:22.652
So you know,

12:22.867 --> 12:25.359
you just stared blankly at me
for, like, 20 seconds.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.785
Shut up.

12:27.622 --> 12:28.908
And no noodles.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.451
Just broth.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.623
I've never even heard of this
Sweet Lady Pain person.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.424
She was the local dominatrix
murdered in her dungeon.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.172
You reported the story
on the news.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.051
My job is to read the news,
not absorb it.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.054
Frankly, I resent being
questioned every time a hooker

12:49.269 --> 12:51.932
or stripper or dominatrix
gets killed in this town.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.138
Why don't you ever bug me when
somebody murders a plumber?

12:54.399 --> 12:55.515
You hang out with
a lot of plumbers?

12:55.733 --> 12:56.974
That was rhetorical.

12:57.193 --> 13:01.654
Look, hookers, strippers,
yeah, but a dominatrix?

13:01.864 --> 13:03.275
I'm a married man, Detective.

13:03.491 --> 13:07.326
I already give way too much of
my money to a woman who abuses me.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.654
We have
Sweet Lady Pain's client list.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.113
Your name's on it.

13:12.875 --> 13:13.831
Oh!

13:14.419 --> 13:16.411
Sweet Lady Pain's on Pike?

13:16.671 --> 13:19.414
I may have visited her
establishment once or twice

13:19.632 --> 13:21.715
for an investigative piece.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.009
Do you remember where you were
the night of her murder?

13:24.178 --> 13:26.841
Same place I am every time
you've accused me of murder.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.263
On the air.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.511
Were you aware
she recorded her sessions?

13:32.103 --> 13:34.686
Am I wrong
to find that unethical?

13:35.690 --> 13:37.852
The people of Seattle
rely on me

13:38.067 --> 13:40.229
as a symbol
of wisdom and integrity.

13:40.403 --> 13:41.939
This stuff didn't matter when
I was doing the weather,

13:42.155 --> 13:44.192
but now I am their anchor,
man.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.190
You have to find those tapes.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.991
For the good of our fair city.

13:51.706 --> 13:54.289
You two.
Stay the hell out of my case.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.996
Yeah, thought so.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.873
- What makes you think we're...
- Stop it.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.454
You're embarrassing yourself.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.540
The guy with the "Don't
Tread on Me" bumper sticker

14:03.760 --> 14:05.171
seen driving by
the Tuttle-Reid home

14:05.386 --> 14:06.718
the night before the murder...

14:06.929 --> 14:08.340
Harley Johns.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.172
Just imagine my surprise

14:10.391 --> 14:12.678
when I show up at his gun
range to question him,

14:12.935 --> 14:15.598
and Harley goes on a tirade
against the SPD.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.099
He claims we're harassing him.

14:17.315 --> 14:20.854
'Cause apparently a black cop and his
pale partner already interrogated him.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.105
And now he's lawyering up.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.027
- That's not how it went down.
- I don't care

14:24.197 --> 14:26.780
if you had a personal
connection to the victims.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.032
Stay away from my case.

14:31.913 --> 14:32.824
Both of you.

14:37.668 --> 14:41.002
Show of hands if you're
super turned on right now.

14:42.924 --> 14:44.381
You catch what he said?

14:44.634 --> 14:46.546
It was more his tone of voice.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.877
Harley Johns was
casing Wally's house

14:49.097 --> 14:50.463
the day before the murders.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.673
He feels like our guy.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.391
Yeah, but we've got no proof,

14:54.644 --> 14:56.385
and it sounds
like Harley's done talking.

14:57.688 --> 14:58.769
He won't talk to us,

14:58.981 --> 15:01.314
but maybe he'll talk to your
Fillmore-Graves friends.

15:01.526 --> 15:02.687
Why would he talk to them?

15:03.820 --> 15:05.777
I think we can
come up with a reason.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.619
Tell them what you told me.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.868
There's a man. Harley Johns.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.166
His brother worked down in
the basement of Max Rager

15:19.377 --> 15:20.913
and told him about
the zombies down there.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.290
He was killed in the massacre.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.997
Now Harley is preaching
violence against zombies

15:25.216 --> 15:27.503
on an Internet message board,
and it turns out

15:27.718 --> 15:29.505
he was seen driving by
the Tuttle-Reid house

15:29.720 --> 15:30.881
the day before the murders.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.887
- We should get rid of him.
- That's it?

15:33.099 --> 15:35.637
No trial? No jury?
Just an execution.

15:35.852 --> 15:38.890
Do we wait until he puts a bullet
in another little zombie boy's head?

15:39.105 --> 15:41.438
Let's not all forget
that I work with the police.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.231
No one's getting
rid of anyone.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.900
What we need is information.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.647
Now, he won't talk
to the police,

15:46.863 --> 15:48.195
but I bet he'll talk to you.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.523
- Why's that?
- Because you're gonna pay him to.

15:50.741 --> 15:51.948
I am?

15:56.330 --> 15:57.491
What's happening?

15:57.665 --> 15:58.951
A vision, I think.

16:00.668 --> 16:01.954
A long one.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.995
We may need to reboot her.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.506
<i>LIV: Suspect number 10,</i>

16:07.717 --> 16:11.006
square jaw, salt and
pepper stubble, full lips.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.713
Another anonymous Snapchat.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.265
And you didn't screen grab
this time because...

16:16.476 --> 16:19.560
Ask me another question, Jimmy,
and I will put you over my knee.

16:20.730 --> 16:21.891
Really?

16:24.484 --> 16:27.022
- How's it going?
- Maybe knock next time.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.946
I thought I made myself clear
when I said, "Shut your mouth."

16:33.075 --> 16:35.032
Glory be to the father and...

16:35.244 --> 16:36.280
ROXANNE: In Latin.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.156
What?

16:37.371 --> 16:38.703
(GASPS) Okay...

16:38.915 --> 16:41.202
(SPEAKING LATIN)

16:41.417 --> 16:42.498
Uh... (EXCLAIMS)

16:42.710 --> 16:44.622
(STAMMERING) Wait, wait, wait.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.375
(CONTINUING IN LATIN)
Ow!

16:47.590 --> 16:49.047
Oh, Latin!

16:49.258 --> 16:51.375
Oh, why hast Thou forsaken me?

16:51.594 --> 16:53.130
Oh! There's a pervert
spying on us!

16:53.346 --> 16:54.553
ROXANNE: Not again.

16:56.474 --> 16:57.715
You just did
the staring thing.

16:57.975 --> 16:58.761
Shut up.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.011
She's single, right?

17:04.022 --> 17:06.481
- Hey...
- Is for horses.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.854
Grabbing is for
friends and lovers,

17:09.237 --> 17:10.898
or people who enjoy
being sued.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.938
Where were you the night
of Roxanne Greer's murder?

17:13.156 --> 17:15.069
I'm a defense lawyer. I've
got a lot of dead people names

17:15.284 --> 17:16.569
swimming around in my noggin.

17:16.786 --> 17:17.776
Can you be more specific?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.323
Sweet Lady Pain.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.406
And when exactly
was she killed?

17:22.625 --> 17:24.867
Maybe we should move this
to somewhere more private.

17:25.169 --> 17:28.788
I'm not sure what you plan on measuring
in here, but I'd recommend a yard stick.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.459
Shut your mouth.

17:30.633 --> 17:31.999
Hmm. That's kind of my line.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.129
(DOOR OPENS)

17:34.512 --> 17:36.504
Your dog groomer
confirmed your alibi.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.423
If you don't mind, we'd still like
to ask you a couple of questions.

17:39.684 --> 17:40.765
Guess what? I mind.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.843
Get your ass
back in that chair.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.306
In lieu of laughing
in your face,

17:44.522 --> 17:46.354
I'm going to chuckle
to myself on the way out.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.021
Be a good boy,

17:51.279 --> 17:53.896
and I won't make you answer
Clive's questions in Latin.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.868
How long were you a client
of Sweet Lady Pain's?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.447
Any association between
myself and the deceased

18:03.666 --> 18:05.202
is purely speculative
on your part.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.375
Would you say you visited her
dungeon on a regular basis?

18:07.587 --> 18:09.203
I wouldn't say anything
that in any way would

18:09.422 --> 18:11.129
confirm or deny
visiting anywhere.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.083
I will say that the definition
of "regular basis"

18:14.302 --> 18:15.964
varies from person to person.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.550
Your "regular basis"
could be my "sporadic."

18:18.764 --> 18:21.598
Are there any other questions
you'd like me to expertly evade?

18:21.809 --> 18:25.052
Yes. Can you order a Catholic
schoolboy's uniform in a 44-tall

18:25.271 --> 18:27.103
or do you have to have that
specially made?

18:30.234 --> 18:32.191
You have very
specific ideas regarding

18:32.361 --> 18:34.193
my alleged connection
to the victim.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.818
Would it be accurate to say
that there's an existing record

18:37.033 --> 18:38.569
of Ms. Pain's sessions?

18:38.784 --> 18:41.197
Mmm, we can neither
confirm or deny that.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.946
Some of Roxanne's clients
mentioned she had a problem

18:44.165 --> 18:45.497
with an unwanted voyeur.

18:45.708 --> 18:46.789
Know anything about that?

18:47.001 --> 18:48.492
Assuming I was a client,
then yes.

18:48.711 --> 18:50.794
She may have also mentioned
that the peeping Tom

18:51.005 --> 18:53.042
had been a client who scared
the hell out of her.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.418
Could you identify him?

18:55.134 --> 18:58.753
If I had seen someone, then it is possible
that I could recognize said person.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.847
Do any of these men
look familiar?

19:09.106 --> 19:11.519
If I had seen a voyeur peeping
in Ms. Pain's window,

19:11.734 --> 19:14.442
and I am not saying
that I was ever there,

19:17.198 --> 19:19.315
I would be certain
it was this guy.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.201
Need a little help.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.829
There's a stool in the back.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.422
Dick.

19:36.634 --> 19:37.841
You say something?

19:38.594 --> 19:40.176
No, you're hearing things,
big fella.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.928
(SCOFFS LIGHTLY)

19:45.601 --> 19:48.560
Tell your grandma I'mma swing
by to roll her a few spliffs.

19:48.771 --> 19:51.980
Rheumatoid arthritis ain't gonna stop
no sweet lady from getting her swerve on.

19:52.191 --> 19:52.977
Yeah.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.527
Come on, let's go.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.070
How much will a U-boat
set me back?

20:02.284 --> 20:04.617
Twenty will get you
a ticket to ride, my friend.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.486
- Can I hook you up?
- Nah.

20:06.706 --> 20:10.245
Just professional curiosity.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.542
- Your stuff any good?
- Negatory.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.712
Quality Utopium is a relic
of a bygone era.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.415
Mr. Boss took out the crew
slinging Lucky U.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.338
Not all of them.

20:22.263 --> 20:22.878
What?

20:23.973 --> 20:25.384
(CHUCKLES) You?

20:26.851 --> 20:27.887
Straight up.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.642
My man!

20:31.105 --> 20:33.062
(LAUGHING)

20:33.315 --> 20:35.181
I got to try it once.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.767
It's a night
I'll never forget.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.899
Tangerine trees,
marmalade skies,

20:40.114 --> 20:41.355
the whole shebang.

20:41.907 --> 20:42.988
You want another taste?

20:44.535 --> 20:45.446
Yeah.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.277
(ROCK SONG PLAYING)

21:08.142 --> 21:10.304
(YELLING)
You wanna be a zombie?

21:10.519 --> 21:13.102
- What?
- A zombie. It's rad, I swear.

21:13.355 --> 21:16.814
If this is being a zombie,
then bring it on!

21:17.026 --> 21:18.938
(BOTH SCREAMING EXCITEDLY)

21:29.330 --> 21:31.538
This is torture
and I'm not even enjoying it.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.701
Tell me again how we know the
peeping Tom had a criminal record?

21:35.878 --> 21:36.959
We don't.

21:37.171 --> 21:38.787
We're taking
an uneducated guess.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.210
It's what you do
when you hit a dead end.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.421
We've got company.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.466
You needing me to get you
a teleprompter, Johnny?

21:52.561 --> 21:55.395
I was told not to speak
until my lawyer is present.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.524
Oh, Lord.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.150
I told you to meet me
in the waiting area.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.562
Do you see a coffee table
strewn with magazines?

22:03.781 --> 22:04.897
- No, I was...
- Shut your mouth.

22:05.115 --> 22:08.233
My client has information
in the Roxanne Greer case,

22:08.452 --> 22:09.192
but we have a conundrum.

22:09.411 --> 22:13.496
Relaying what he knows may or may
not indicate that he violated the law.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.994
Well, he either broke the law
or he didn't. Which is it?

22:16.210 --> 22:17.997
It's both. And it's neither.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.920
Now, we were willing to offer
you a resolution to your case

22:21.131 --> 22:24.124
if you were willing
to ignore a tiny white lie

22:24.343 --> 22:26.960
that barely
obstructed justice.

22:27.471 --> 22:28.382
Done.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.718
A couple days after Roxanne was
murdered, I received an email.

22:34.979 --> 22:38.939
The sender threatened to release a
video of my session with Sweet Lady Pain

22:39.149 --> 22:41.186
unless I paid them 10 grand.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.687
<i>(CRACKS WHIP) -Oui! Oui!</i>

22:45.906 --> 22:48.193
<i>Oui! Climate change!</i>

22:49.410 --> 22:50.946
"Climate change"
is my safe word.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.869
My client regrets not coming
forward with this information sooner,

22:54.081 --> 22:55.913
and for that,
he is very sorry.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.536
He doesn't look sorry to me.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.083
Maybe if he crawled
across the floor

22:59.295 --> 23:01.002
a couple times
on his knees.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.376
You're not crawling
across the floor.

23:03.591 --> 23:04.456
Yet.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.465
Look, my client made
an innocent mistake.

23:06.677 --> 23:09.044
I thought I could make the whole
thing go away by paying the money.

23:09.263 --> 23:12.301
Only an idiot would trust a
blackmailer to destroy the footage.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.883
Say it out loud.
"I'm an idiot."

23:15.144 --> 23:16.806
Detective, can you tell
your partner to stop

23:17.021 --> 23:18.603
verbally abusing my client?

23:18.814 --> 23:21.272
Tell your client
to stop asking for it.

23:21.692 --> 23:22.933
I have an important
bomb to drop

23:23.152 --> 23:25.439
if you're done
with your shenanigans.

23:26.614 --> 23:29.072
Good. Yesterday,
Mr. Frost received

23:29.283 --> 23:32.401
another request for money in
exchange for not releasing the video.

23:32.995 --> 23:35.157
You picking up what
I'm putting down, Detective?

23:38.751 --> 23:40.617
Where do we arrange the drop?

23:55.893 --> 23:58.351
- Vivian?
- I'm sorry, General, I'll have to call you back.

23:58.562 --> 23:59.598
My guest is here.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.520
There he is. Mr. Johns!

24:01.732 --> 24:03.940
I was told there was some sort of
a settlement for my brother's death.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.687
Come join me over here
if you will.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.815
You can sit there.
These are my top people.

24:08.030 --> 24:10.363
A.K. Fortesan runs
our military operations.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.440
Carey Gold runs
everything else.

24:14.370 --> 24:15.531
We understand you
lost your brother

24:15.746 --> 24:17.954
in the tragedy at
Max Rager headquarters.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.786
And as you know,
we purchased the company.

24:22.086 --> 24:25.079
I realize that $10,000 check
isn't gonna end your pain,

24:25.881 --> 24:28.589
but we hope that it will cover
the funeral expenses,

24:28.801 --> 24:30.713
and help your family
through this tough time.

24:30.928 --> 24:31.918
So what's the catch?

24:32.554 --> 24:33.544
There's no catch.

24:33.764 --> 24:34.971
Then I guess I'll be
on my way then.

24:35.224 --> 24:36.431
Mr. Johns, before you go,

24:36.642 --> 24:39.476
would you mind answering
just a couple questions?

24:40.646 --> 24:42.353
- There's the catch.
- (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

24:42.564 --> 24:44.681
We've read some of the
theories you've posted online.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.850
Zombies? Really?

24:47.653 --> 24:48.609
You can laugh,

24:49.113 --> 24:50.695
but I know it for a fact.

24:51.365 --> 24:53.357
My brother worked
in a secret lab there.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.237
He saw them up close.

24:55.452 --> 24:56.818
And he told me all about them.

24:57.413 --> 24:58.745
That's what
we're interested in.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.492
We want to compare notes.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.707
You know what this is?

25:05.212 --> 25:06.168
I think I do.

25:07.131 --> 25:09.965
I saw the carnage at the
Super Max party firsthand.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.459
People losing their minds,
attacking their friends...

25:12.678 --> 25:14.886
- The zombie outbreak.
- We're thinking a freak virus

25:15.097 --> 25:16.804
that caused the infected
to crave brains.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.803
You're just using different
words to say the same thing.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.726
Some of our men made it down
to the basement lab that night.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.600
We believe our men may have
been exposed to the virus.

25:25.274 --> 25:27.391
Are you familiar with
the Tuttle-Reid murders?

25:27.568 --> 25:28.934
I've heard stories
on the radio.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.977
Caleb Tuttle worked for us.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.779
The police said they found tubes
like these in his refrigerator.

25:33.991 --> 25:36.278
Tubes full of a brain paste.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.029
We suspect he was infected
that same night,

25:38.287 --> 25:40.904
and he swiped the tubes from
the Max Rager basement.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.739
HARLEY: What happened to the rest
of your men who went down there?

25:42.958 --> 25:46.372
We've quarantined them. So far,
none of them are craving brains,

25:46.628 --> 25:47.744
but we're worried about them,

25:48.172 --> 25:49.583
which is why
we brought you in.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.757
We wanted any information your
brother may have passed along to you

25:52.968 --> 25:54.004
that could help us.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.838
I know one foolproof test
to tell if they're zombies.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.054
Yes?

26:00.100 --> 26:03.593
Dave told me that zombies have a
pulse of about 10 beats per minute.

26:04.438 --> 26:06.270
If you wanna know if
your guys are brain eaters,

26:06.815 --> 26:08.181
just check their heart rate.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.145
Nice pro tip.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.226
<i>HARLEY: What do you plan to do
if any of your guys fail the test?</i>

26:12.446 --> 26:14.483
<i>A.K.: We'd have to weigh
our options at that time.</i>

26:14.698 --> 26:17.486
(CHUCKLES)
There's only one real option.

26:17.701 --> 26:19.943
Bullet in the head
and burn the bodies.

26:20.162 --> 26:21.653
These men are our friends.

26:22.164 --> 26:23.245
They have families.

26:24.374 --> 26:25.581
You're part of the problem,
then.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.079
I mean, don't you get it?

26:27.294 --> 26:28.751
It's coming.

26:28.962 --> 26:31.625
The zombie virus is gonna get
out, and it's gonna spread.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.173
And then it'll be us
versus them.

26:34.384 --> 26:38.003
We tried to warn people, but
they called us lunatics, fringe.

26:39.181 --> 26:41.218
But whatever, fine.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.642
They're gonna be zombie food,
and I won't shed a tear.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.348
Not us, though.

26:46.522 --> 26:48.434
See, we're taking this
seriously.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.900
We are well-armed, and
we're taking the war to them.

26:52.486 --> 26:54.648
And who, exactly, is "we"?

26:54.863 --> 26:56.729
Me and my fellow travelers.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.612
We're the ones who understand that if
you're not willing to do what it takes,

26:59.827 --> 27:02.911
you're gonna end up a zombie
or a zombie snack.

27:03.497 --> 27:04.613
Either way,

27:05.124 --> 27:06.365
you won't be spared.

27:16.009 --> 27:17.841
We appreciate your time,
Mr. Johns.

27:18.262 --> 27:19.343
You don't believe me, do you?

27:20.639 --> 27:24.223
I'm a bit more inclined to
believe something medical. A virus.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.925
"Zombies" is a bit of a leap.

27:26.854 --> 27:27.970
What do you call that?

27:30.607 --> 27:32.143
Are you sure
your brother didn't just

27:32.359 --> 27:35.067
send you a picture
from a zombie movie?

27:35.279 --> 27:37.145
Bury your head in the sand
if you want to.

27:37.364 --> 27:40.357
It's a shame. Military contractor
like you could be awful handy.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.738
Once the virus
starts to spread?

27:42.953 --> 27:44.285
By then, it'll be too late.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.209
We've learned a lot.

33:31.593 --> 33:34.051
His lungs are filling up with
fluid. He needs the cure. Now.

33:34.888 --> 33:36.049
Cure for what?

33:41.937 --> 33:44.099
- Don't inject him.
- We have no choice. He's gonna die.

33:44.314 --> 33:46.055
If we turn him human,
these wounds will kill him.

33:46.274 --> 33:48.311
- What? Turn him human?
- Then what's the plan?

33:48.527 --> 33:50.109
Pray the pleural effusion
doesn't kill him first?

33:50.320 --> 33:52.858
With the rats, the pneumonia was the
precursor to their brains melting.

33:53.073 --> 33:55.235
Get me an empty syringe with
the biggest needle we can find.

33:55.492 --> 33:57.654
I'll treat the effusion
with a thorancentesis.

34:00.789 --> 34:01.996
Help me get him on his side.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.708
This should buy us enough time
for his wounds to heal.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.130
You got this.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.138
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

34:25.605 --> 34:26.686
(WHOOPING)

34:33.405 --> 34:34.862
ALL: Cheers!

34:37.909 --> 34:38.989
What else do you need, boss?

34:39.244 --> 34:40.655
I'm good, slick.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.610
The grand opening
was a success.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.197
What do these fools
keep saying?

34:44.416 --> 34:46.032
It's Bengali for "cheers."

34:46.251 --> 34:47.913
We're serving tiger brains?

34:48.128 --> 34:51.087
No... The brains are from
a hospital in Bangladesh.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.710
- Oh!
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

34:54.342 --> 34:57.835
If only my old corner boy
buddies could see me now.

34:59.806 --> 35:02.014
A round of drinks on me!

35:02.267 --> 35:06.386
Don E.,
your humble proprietor.

35:06.605 --> 35:07.891
Cheers!

35:14.404 --> 35:15.315
(SNORING)

35:18.658 --> 35:19.489
Go to bed.

35:22.495 --> 35:24.361
I'll stay with Major.

35:24.581 --> 35:25.412
I'll, uh...

35:25.665 --> 35:27.327
I'll make another
pot of coffee.

35:27.751 --> 35:28.958
No.

35:29.169 --> 35:31.411
Get some rest, we need you
on your game tomorrow.

35:36.718 --> 35:38.755
I'll be right down the hall
if you need me.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.073
- Hey...
- Shh.

36:05.747 --> 36:06.863
Go back to sleep.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.499
What happened?

36:11.127 --> 36:12.993
The pneumonia was
gonna take you out,

36:13.838 --> 36:15.750
but we couldn't give you
the cure until

36:16.257 --> 36:18.419
your combat wounds
had healed a bit.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.630
What happened with Blaine?

36:21.888 --> 36:23.049
Did the memory serum work?

36:24.683 --> 36:25.890
It didn't.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.261
I'm so sorry, Major.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.148
(SIGHS)

36:37.112 --> 36:38.353
Then this is it.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.772
Once I heal up,

36:42.701 --> 36:44.033
I take the cure,

36:44.244 --> 36:48.363
and everyone I've ever known
is wiped from my memory.

36:49.165 --> 36:51.373
Maybe the cure won't have
the same effect on you.

36:51.584 --> 36:52.791
- Maybe you'll...
- Liv.

36:53.002 --> 36:53.992
Stop.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.712
I need you to do
something for me.

37:02.721 --> 37:03.837
Name it.

37:05.432 --> 37:06.764
Once I'm new me,

37:08.226 --> 37:10.468
keep reminding me of
what we meant to each other?

37:18.903 --> 37:19.893
(SIGHS)

37:21.281 --> 37:23.147
And give me a new name.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.528
One that's less silly.

37:26.703 --> 37:27.944
Gern Blanston.

37:28.872 --> 37:30.704
- Why not.
- (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

37:34.210 --> 37:36.372
Tell me about
the first time we kissed.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.792
That's one memory
I don't want to lose.

37:39.799 --> 37:43.088
It was more of a heavy
make-out session actually.

37:43.303 --> 37:44.794
You'd come over to "study."

37:44.971 --> 37:46.178
Remember what
you were wearing?

37:46.389 --> 37:47.345
I don't.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.055
Pajamas.

37:49.350 --> 37:51.307
- Laundry day pajamas.
- (LAUGHS)

37:51.519 --> 37:52.680
(CHUCKLING) I thought,

37:52.896 --> 37:54.979
"There's no way
this girl is into me."

37:55.190 --> 37:57.022
I was comfortable around you.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.895
- It's a gift you have, Gern.
- (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

37:59.527 --> 38:00.984
You put people at ease.

38:04.407 --> 38:05.488
(SIGHS)

38:07.952 --> 38:09.739
You looked beautiful.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.667
There's one silver lining
to forgetting everything.

38:21.508 --> 38:22.339
What?

38:24.636 --> 38:27.720
You'll knock me off my feet
all over again.

38:27.931 --> 38:29.422
(FOLK SONG PLAYING)

39:08.304 --> 39:09.636
(INHALES DEEPLY)

39:51.931 --> 39:53.172
Liv...

39:59.522 --> 40:00.558
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

40:01.900 --> 40:02.686
Come in.

40:08.573 --> 40:09.905
I can come back.

40:10.366 --> 40:11.231
It's okay.

40:13.578 --> 40:14.739
How's our patient?

40:15.830 --> 40:17.321
Keeping it together.

40:19.334 --> 40:20.290
(SIGHS)

40:23.963 --> 40:26.376
You are healing
enough to survive,

40:26.591 --> 40:28.878
even as a
relatively fragile human.

40:32.847 --> 40:33.553
It's time.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.508
The memory loss
won't be instant.

40:36.893 --> 40:38.634
It'll feel like a slow fade.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.891
With Blaine,
it took a couple of days.

40:42.732 --> 40:43.848
Got it.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.727
You know, I had
this whole speech planned.

40:48.905 --> 40:51.397
It was funny
and heartfelt, profound.

40:51.824 --> 40:54.282
But it feels like a waste if
you're just gonna forget it anyway.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.404
Let's just agree
it was brilliant.

41:00.541 --> 41:01.497
Yeah.

41:03.086 --> 41:04.952
Is there anything
you want to add, Liv?

41:05.964 --> 41:07.705
It's already been said.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.546
I'm gonna miss you guys.

41:20.937 --> 41:22.803
We're not going anywhere.
