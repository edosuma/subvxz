WEBVTT

00:05.297 --> 00:07.865
Dean! Dean!

00:07.932 --> 00:09.366
Don't shoot,
red-haired guy.

00:09.434 --> 00:10.184
Why not?

00:10.304 --> 00:11.625
Something's not right
about the game.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.277
We just took out a guy
who turned out to be

00:13.404 --> 00:14.695
a professional
paintball assassin.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.907
A professional?
Aah!

00:16.974 --> 00:18.175
That doesn't make sense.

00:18.242 --> 00:20.243
Why would someone
who gets paid to do things

00:20.311 --> 00:22.712
be at Greendale?

00:22.780 --> 00:24.981
Aah!

00:25.049 --> 00:27.451
I'm not playing!
I'm not playing!

00:27.518 --> 00:30.687
No, I'm the dean!
Stop shooting me!

00:30.755 --> 00:33.223
Aah!

00:36.561 --> 00:37.994
Hi, Pistol Patty.

00:38.062 --> 00:40.130
Did they take you hostage?

00:43.901 --> 00:45.769
Dean Spreck?

00:45.837 --> 00:47.571
Hello, Craig.

00:47.638 --> 00:48.939
City College.

00:49.006 --> 00:51.208
Now I understand everything.

00:51.275 --> 00:55.345
Now your whole evil plan
is clear as day.

00:55.413 --> 00:58.515
But if you need to explain it
to your men, I understand.

00:58.583 --> 00:59.883
It's simple, Craig.

00:59.951 --> 01:02.786
I posed as a fake
ice cream company,

01:02.854 --> 01:05.188
sponsored your
end-of-the-year picnic,

01:05.256 --> 01:08.158
and waved enough money
under your students' noses

01:08.226 --> 01:11.461
to provoke them
to destroy their own campus.

01:11.529 --> 01:13.163
Who hurt you, Steven?

01:13.231 --> 01:16.066
How could any dean be so mean?

01:16.134 --> 01:18.568
Oh, you haven't seen

01:18.636 --> 01:22.572
how mean this dean
can be...en.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.007
There's one!

01:25.076 --> 01:26.776
After him!

01:26.844 --> 01:29.880
Aah! Aah!

01:29.947 --> 01:32.115
Wait, did you say "bean"?

01:34.986 --> 01:42.955

01:48.666 --> 01:51.535
Guys. Guys.

01:51.602 --> 01:53.470
City College is trying
to destroy Greendale,

01:53.538 --> 01:55.071
and they're an unstoppable
juggle knob.

01:55.139 --> 01:56.239
- Juggernaut.
- Juggernaut.

01:56.307 --> 01:58.074
Which means if
we're gonna fight them,

01:58.142 --> 02:01.411
we have to form a school-wide
alliance of rebels.

02:01.479 --> 02:03.280
In other words, it seems
we've left the Western motif

02:03.347 --> 02:04.648
and are entering a more
of a <i>Star Wars</i> scenario.

02:04.715 --> 02:06.383
I know.

02:06.450 --> 02:07.584
I wish it happened sooner too.

02:07.652 --> 02:09.085
But if we surrender
our individuality

02:09.152 --> 02:10.220
to form a faceless regime,

02:10.288 --> 02:11.488
how are we any better than them?

02:11.556 --> 02:13.156
You're the worst.

02:13.224 --> 02:14.958
Okay, she is just
saying that to fit in.

02:15.026 --> 02:16.793
The floor recognizes Magnitude.

02:16.861 --> 02:18.395
First off, pop, pop!

02:20.631 --> 02:22.933
And second,
Magnitude's a one-man party.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.734
A one-man party
can't be in an alliance.

02:24.802 --> 02:25.902
That's a paradox.

02:25.970 --> 02:28.205
- I agree to disagree.
- Easy, paradox.

02:28.272 --> 02:29.406
We're all on the same side.

02:29.473 --> 02:32.008
But hasn't the other side
already won?

02:32.076 --> 02:33.443
Their goal was to make us
trash the school.

02:33.511 --> 02:34.644
We trashed it.

02:34.712 --> 02:36.079
Yeah, but we still
might have a chance

02:36.147 --> 02:37.080
to hit 'em where it hurts.

02:37.148 --> 02:38.381
- Their balls?
- No.

02:38.449 --> 02:40.317
- Just below their balls?
- Their wallet, Leonard.

02:40.384 --> 02:42.419
- I think it's called a taint.
- Oh.

02:42.486 --> 02:44.221
Why do you think
they sent in a ringer to win?

02:44.288 --> 02:46.289
It must be because we're entitled

02:46.357 --> 02:48.325
to the prize they promised--

02:48.392 --> 02:49.693
100 Gs.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.061
Ooh, I could use that money.

02:51.128 --> 02:53.296
This is why
we have to agree right now

02:53.364 --> 02:56.266
that whoever wins,
we give the money to Greendale.

02:57.768 --> 02:59.469
To repair the damage
and save our school.

02:59.537 --> 03:00.870
Abed, tell him.

03:00.938 --> 03:02.872
Whatever, pal. I ain't in it
for your revolution.

03:02.940 --> 03:03.974
I'm in it for me.

03:04.041 --> 03:05.675
Wait, Abed, this was your idea.

03:05.743 --> 03:07.043
I know, but I'm calling dibs
on the Han Solo role

03:07.111 --> 03:09.346
before Jeff
slouches into it by default.

03:09.413 --> 03:10.547
Star-Burns,
I need that vest.

03:10.615 --> 03:11.648
Oh, yeah, right.

03:11.716 --> 03:13.183
Give me the vest, Laser Breath,

03:13.251 --> 03:18.288
before our conversation
gets nasty.

03:18.356 --> 03:20.690
Question.
How long is the game gonna last?

03:20.758 --> 03:22.125
'Cause Andre's
home with the baby--

03:22.193 --> 03:24.494
Damn it, Shirley.
Forget your newborn child

03:24.562 --> 03:26.096
and think about
the people that need you.

03:26.163 --> 03:27.964
I can't afford to lose
a single soldier.

03:28.032 --> 03:29.933
- What?
- Oh, now you're the leader?

03:30.001 --> 03:31.468
I don't see you stepping up.

03:31.535 --> 03:33.670
I don't step up
to being leader, Troy.

03:33.738 --> 03:35.772
I reluctantly accept it
when it's thrust upon me.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.441
Oh, Jeff.

03:38.509 --> 03:40.143
Oh, my God.
What is that?

03:42.000 --> 03:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:55.726 --> 03:56.660
Magnitude!

03:56.727 --> 03:58.261
Pop...

03:58.329 --> 03:59.963
P...

04:00.031 --> 04:01.765
Pop what?
Pop what?

04:01.832 --> 04:07.570
What is he trying to say?
Pop what, Magnitude?

04:07.638 --> 04:09.339
Can you hear me?
Who is this?

04:09.407 --> 04:11.608
Oh, that's Jeff Winger.

04:11.676 --> 04:14.077
You are in trouble now.

04:14.145 --> 04:15.545
Jeffrey,
it's your friend, the dean.

04:15.613 --> 04:18.081
I'm safe!

04:18.149 --> 04:20.149
I can hear you,
Mr. Winger.

04:20.216 --> 04:23.186
This is City College's
dean Spreck.

04:23.254 --> 04:24.954
Hey, Spreck, you cheat.

04:25.022 --> 04:27.090
You can't spray people
with paint by remote.

04:27.158 --> 04:28.692
And you can't have
City College students

04:28.759 --> 04:29.793
in a Greendale game.

04:29.860 --> 04:31.494
All my men have been registered

04:31.562 --> 04:32.962
at Greendale for weeks.

04:33.030 --> 04:35.298
As for rules,
they're clearly defined

04:35.366 --> 04:36.666
in your school's agreement

04:36.734 --> 04:38.501
with my fake
ice cream company--

04:38.569 --> 04:41.471
If you get paint on you,
you're out.

04:41.539 --> 04:43.506
Well, I'm glad to see
there's paperwork involved,

04:43.574 --> 04:46.609
because we are going to win,
and you are gonna pay.

04:46.677 --> 04:49.979
Yay! Go,
Jeff Winger study group!

04:50.047 --> 04:52.482
Those guys are ballers, yo.

04:52.550 --> 04:54.684
I hope you like getting balled.

04:55.853 --> 04:57.987
Sir, this guy tried to charge us

04:58.055 --> 05:00.724
three paint balls
to use the bathroom.

05:00.791 --> 05:01.825
We were gonna shoot him,

05:01.892 --> 05:03.159
but tell him what you told us.

05:03.227 --> 05:04.327
Don't shoot me.

05:04.395 --> 05:06.229
Great.
Now shoot him.

05:06.297 --> 05:08.031
Sure, shoot me.

05:08.099 --> 05:12.969
You'd certainly be doing
Jeff Winger a big favor.

05:13.037 --> 05:14.070
Greendale human beings,

05:14.138 --> 05:17.574
it is now clear
that we have no choice

05:17.641 --> 05:20.043
but to team up
and defeat City College.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.177
I also have no choice

05:21.245 --> 05:23.246
but to accept the role
thrust upon me.

05:23.314 --> 05:24.848
And what role would that be?

05:24.915 --> 05:26.449
No time to squabble, Troy.

05:26.517 --> 05:28.284
"For Greendale" on three.

05:28.352 --> 05:29.819
One, two...

05:29.887 --> 05:31.020
Jeff, every second counts.

05:31.088 --> 05:33.256
"For Greendale" on two.
One...

05:33.324 --> 05:34.557
Guys.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.760
For Greendale!

05:36.827 --> 05:38.785
For Greendale!

05:40.444 --> 05:42.562
Greendale students...

05:42.802 --> 05:44.470
I understand you've unified,

05:44.537 --> 05:47.239
and intend to draw this game out.

05:47.307 --> 05:49.341
Well, if it's a war you want,

05:49.409 --> 05:51.844
it's a war you will lose.

05:51.911 --> 05:55.347
City College is stronger, faster.

05:55.415 --> 05:58.917
Our sperm counts are higher.
Even in our women.

05:58.985 --> 06:01.753
Resistance is as pointless
as your degrees.

06:01.821 --> 06:03.555
Honestly, ask yourself,

06:03.623 --> 06:06.692
what does "liberal arts"
even mean?

06:06.759 --> 06:08.360
Look, "Welcome to Greendale.

06:08.428 --> 06:09.795
You're already accepted."

06:09.863 --> 06:11.530
Losers.

06:14.367 --> 06:17.569
- Welcome to Greendale.
- You're already dead.

06:21.407 --> 06:22.541
Jackpot.

06:22.609 --> 06:24.943
Shirley, you keep watch
while we get these.

06:29.082 --> 06:30.082
Here.
Help me with this.

06:30.150 --> 06:31.950
Sure thing, your worship.

06:32.018 --> 06:32.951
Abed!

06:33.019 --> 06:34.520
Stop trying to be Han Solo.

06:34.587 --> 06:36.421
It's making me
embarrassed for you.

06:36.489 --> 06:38.257
Come on.
Admit it. You like it.

06:38.324 --> 06:40.559
I like having conversations
with adults.

06:40.627 --> 06:42.694
Playing <i>Star Wars</i>
is worn out and immature.

06:42.762 --> 06:46.331
You like me because I'm immature.

06:46.399 --> 06:50.402
There's not enough
immaturity in your life.

06:50.470 --> 06:52.004
I hope I don't
get shot waiting out here.

06:52.071 --> 06:56.808
I'd hate to go home to my babies.

06:56.876 --> 06:58.010
So reconnaissance indicates

06:58.077 --> 07:00.179
the key to City College's
strategy is

07:00.246 --> 07:02.814
the gatling gun inside
the ice cream truck,

07:02.882 --> 07:04.816
which we will charge en masse,

07:04.884 --> 07:06.018
overwhelming their defenses,

07:06.085 --> 07:07.986
and taking that gun
for ourselves.

07:08.054 --> 07:09.821
Well, that's not how
I would proceed.

07:09.889 --> 07:11.590
Troy, do you happen
to have a better plan?

07:11.658 --> 07:14.393
I do happen, Jeff.
I happen very much.

07:14.460 --> 07:16.228
We'll use sneak attacks

07:16.296 --> 07:18.230
to draw their patrol
to the library,

07:18.298 --> 07:19.998
where one of us
will pull the fire alarm,

07:20.066 --> 07:21.600
activating the sprinklers,

07:21.668 --> 07:23.869
which I will have rigged
using my super plumbing skills

07:23.937 --> 07:26.371
to shower everything
in the building with paint.

07:26.439 --> 07:28.006
Paint in sprinklers?

07:28.074 --> 07:30.175
- Are we the little rascals?
- I was.

07:30.243 --> 07:31.276
Have you heard your plan?

07:31.344 --> 07:33.011
You want to charge a machine gun.

07:40.119 --> 07:41.286
I've got something to say.

07:41.354 --> 07:43.222
I don't take orders from girls.

07:43.289 --> 07:45.023
Because they don't talk to me.

07:45.091 --> 07:46.625
Watch it, Quasar face.

07:46.693 --> 07:49.161
Annie's a good kid
and a better shot.

07:49.229 --> 07:51.663
So listen up,
or you'll be floating home.

07:51.731 --> 07:54.166
Thank you, Abed.
Sorry.

07:54.234 --> 07:56.735
Han.

07:56.803 --> 07:59.471
Okay, I think we should
split the troops in half

07:59.539 --> 08:01.873
and carry out both plans
simultaneously.

08:01.941 --> 08:04.643
Troy, your plan will lure people
off the ice cream truck,

08:04.711 --> 08:08.447
allowing Jeff's troops
to take the stronghold.

08:08.514 --> 08:10.282
You're welcome.

08:10.350 --> 08:11.850
I'm so glad
that we didn't shoot you.

08:11.918 --> 08:13.885
Now we have
the tactical advantage

08:13.953 --> 08:16.622
of knowing that Jeff Winger
wants to be a ballerina,

08:16.689 --> 08:20.726
and that his Achilles heel
is...wieners.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.461
That's just
the tip of the iceberg.

08:22.528 --> 08:23.695
For one more pudding,

08:23.763 --> 08:26.231
I'll tell you why
he's jealous of me.

08:26.299 --> 08:28.367
And you say that they kicked
you out of their study group

08:28.434 --> 08:29.701
- after two years?
- Yeah.

08:29.769 --> 08:31.603
What took them so long?

08:38.578 --> 08:41.446
Hey, thanks for sticking up
for me back there.

08:41.514 --> 08:44.249
This group gets so tangled
in each other's feelings,

08:44.317 --> 08:46.385
you're kind of a hero
for standing outside of it.

08:46.452 --> 08:47.719
Yeah, well, heroes are great,

08:47.787 --> 08:49.121
but I'll take a blaster
every time.

08:49.188 --> 08:52.090
Anyway,
just wanted to let you know.

08:52.158 --> 08:54.526
I don't think you're immature.

08:54.594 --> 08:56.862
I think you're great.

08:56.929 --> 08:58.497
For a no-good,

08:58.564 --> 09:02.067
laser-faced,
jabba scoundrel.

09:02.135 --> 09:03.635
You're good, kid.

09:03.703 --> 09:04.736
Don't get cocky.

09:09.842 --> 09:10.776
Hey!

09:19.919 --> 09:21.219
They're right on our tail.

09:21.287 --> 09:22.587
Operation "Troy's Awesome Plan"

09:22.655 --> 09:23.689
is living up to its name.

09:23.756 --> 09:25.791
Yeah, good for you.

09:25.858 --> 09:28.060
Looks like they're
taking Troy's bait.

09:28.127 --> 09:31.029
Squad "B" commencing
operation "Actual Operation."

09:31.097 --> 09:34.399
Everyone look alive.
Leonard, good enough.

09:34.467 --> 09:37.202
Greendale, it's been a pleasure
fighting with you.

09:37.270 --> 09:39.071
Some of us won't make it.

09:39.138 --> 09:41.873
But there is a place where we
will all see each other again,

09:41.941 --> 09:44.109
- and that place is Denny's.
- Which Denny's?

09:44.177 --> 09:45.577
We'll figure it out
later, Leonard.

09:45.645 --> 09:47.379
The one near the 15 exit?
I'm banned from there.

09:47.447 --> 09:48.947
Well, then I guess
I'll see you in hell.

09:49.015 --> 09:50.615
Then let's kick some taint.

09:50.683 --> 09:51.983
Okay. On my count.

09:52.103 --> 09:53.053
One. Two.

09:54.754 --> 09:57.823
Vicki!

10:15.908 --> 10:19.010
All right. Shirley, you have
the most important job, okay?

10:19.078 --> 10:20.445
Yeah, yeah, pull the fire alarm.

10:20.513 --> 10:22.681
Can we move this along?
I'm missing <i>CSI.</i>

10:22.749 --> 10:24.049
Enemy soldiers are incoming.

10:24.117 --> 10:26.985
I need everyone to evacuate
through the air vent--

10:27.053 --> 10:28.420
Garrett!

10:28.488 --> 10:30.422
I may be stuck in this vent.

10:30.490 --> 10:33.258
It is too early to tell.

10:47.673 --> 10:51.009
I think our only choice
is to try and shoot our way out.

10:51.077 --> 10:55.180
Right. Commence operation
"Troy's Awesome Leadership

10:55.248 --> 10:57.716
Is Never in Doubt" plan.

11:12.799 --> 11:13.732
That gun's too powerful.

11:13.800 --> 11:14.966
I'm scared.

11:15.034 --> 11:17.669
Hey, Quendra with a Q-U,

11:17.737 --> 11:19.404
they can kill most of us,

11:19.472 --> 11:21.440
but as long as nobody gives up,

11:21.507 --> 11:24.309
somebody will make it through.
Understand?

11:24.377 --> 11:26.812
Yes.

11:26.879 --> 11:28.680
Charge!

11:30.516 --> 11:32.851
Well, I'm out. We lost.

11:32.919 --> 11:34.019
See you at Denny's?

11:34.086 --> 11:35.921
Denny's is for winners.

11:53.439 --> 11:55.207
Leonard, we're losing.

11:55.274 --> 11:57.142
Britta, I've been in
a few real wars,

11:57.210 --> 12:00.212
but this one is actually
the most terrifying.

12:00.279 --> 12:02.047
Guys, we're dying out here.

12:02.114 --> 12:03.715
Well, we're dying too!

12:03.783 --> 12:06.785
They've trapped us in a dead end.

12:06.853 --> 12:08.320
Hey, kid.

12:08.387 --> 12:10.622
Someone's got to make it
out of here alive.

12:26.572 --> 12:28.540
I had a dream
it would end this way.

12:33.713 --> 12:36.047
Shirley, nobody's making it
out of the library.

12:36.115 --> 12:37.115
Pull the alarm.

12:37.183 --> 12:40.952
Britta, are you alive?
Britta? Britta?

12:42.822 --> 12:44.322
Oh, hell.

12:44.390 --> 12:45.924
Someone's got to win this.

12:53.833 --> 12:54.799
I'm out.

12:54.867 --> 12:56.535
Me too.

12:59.772 --> 13:02.574
Looks like this is it.

13:02.642 --> 13:04.442
Will you still be Han Solo
after we die?

13:04.510 --> 13:05.443
'Fraid not, doll.

13:05.511 --> 13:07.479
Once I'm gone, I'm gone.

13:07.547 --> 13:10.882
Oh. Okay.

13:16.289 --> 13:18.924
Got to do everything myself.

13:36.242 --> 13:44.249
♪ ♪

13:47.219 --> 13:48.219
We're all dead.
All of us.

13:48.287 --> 13:49.854
Paint raining from the sky.

13:49.922 --> 13:51.856
Everyone in the library is dead.

13:51.924 --> 13:54.059
Damn it.

13:57.697 --> 13:59.197
Kill him.

13:59.265 --> 14:00.632
Yes, sir.

14:05.171 --> 14:08.640
It's my h-heart.

14:08.708 --> 14:12.444
Hey, buddy, you okay?

14:14.213 --> 14:16.648
Cool.

14:20.853 --> 14:23.722
Eat paint, you storm-troopin',

14:23.789 --> 14:27.392
City College knob gobblers.

14:27.460 --> 14:28.627
Oh!

14:28.694 --> 14:31.062
You're it, kid.

14:49.982 --> 14:51.616
Shirley.

14:51.684 --> 14:53.018
What are we supposed to do?

14:53.085 --> 14:54.619
How 'bout we save
this school's ass?

14:56.155 --> 14:58.256
Deal.

14:59.825 --> 15:02.494
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

15:28.421 --> 15:29.554
- That's it.
- Is that it?

15:29.622 --> 15:30.789
- I think that's it.
- That's it?

15:30.856 --> 15:32.390
- We win!
- We win!

15:32.458 --> 15:33.858
Oh, we win!

15:37.863 --> 15:38.797
Ha ha ha ha--

15:39.932 --> 15:42.534
Oh!

15:42.601 --> 15:44.102
Yeah! We win! We win!

15:49.442 --> 15:51.209
All right! We did it!

15:52.578 --> 15:53.511
Wait, who are you?

15:53.579 --> 15:55.480
Your mother's lover.

15:55.548 --> 15:58.416
- What?
- What?

15:58.484 --> 15:59.484
I win!

16:04.623 --> 16:08.660
You owe me 100 Gs.

16:08.694 --> 16:11.196
And you can make the check out...

16:11.263 --> 16:14.632
to Greendale.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.167
Yay!

16:17.803 --> 16:20.004
Human beings!
Human beings!

16:20.072 --> 16:22.707
Human beings! Human beings!

16:22.775 --> 16:26.268
Human beings!
Human beings!

16:34.593 --> 16:36.503
- Nice.
- Ooh.

16:39.444 --> 16:41.003
- Okay.
- There it is.

16:41.123 --> 16:44.178
Final meeting of the semester
now in session.

16:44.246 --> 16:45.514
Final order of business--

16:45.634 --> 16:47.582
Pick a class we can all
take in the fall.

16:47.649 --> 16:49.751
We could just take Anthro 201.

16:49.818 --> 16:52.086
Too risky. Sequels are almost
always disappointing.

16:52.154 --> 16:54.322
Since when are you in favor
of playing it safe, Han?

16:54.390 --> 16:55.957
Cool down, Annie.

16:56.024 --> 16:58.126
I was only Han Solo
because the context demanded it.

16:58.193 --> 17:03.331
But here.

17:03.399 --> 17:05.133
Oh. Star-Burns.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.402
Yeah, he uses some kind
of crystal instead of deodorant.

17:07.469 --> 17:09.303
Guys, I know exactly
what we should do.

17:09.371 --> 17:12.973
We should see what Troy
thinks we should do.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.442
Had some good ideas today.

17:14.510 --> 17:17.979
Thanks, man.

17:18.046 --> 17:21.249
Okay. I've given this
a lot of thought,

17:21.316 --> 17:24.685
and I've decided
we should sleep on it.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.755
Just came back
for my day planner.

17:27.823 --> 17:29.424
Pretend I'm not even here.

17:29.491 --> 17:30.892
You guys are great at that.

17:30.959 --> 17:34.495
Come on, Pierce. We all know
this is no "day planner."

17:34.563 --> 17:35.630
Here it is.

17:35.697 --> 17:37.064
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:37.132 --> 17:39.100
it appears I'm running late
to drink a bottle of wine

17:39.168 --> 17:40.101
in my bathing suit.

17:40.169 --> 17:45.940
Pierce, wait.

17:46.008 --> 17:50.378
You know, I've been coming
to this school for 12 years.

17:50.446 --> 17:52.780
I've never been friends
with anyone here

17:52.848 --> 17:55.383
more than a semester.

17:55.451 --> 17:58.352
Probably for the same reason
I've been married seven times.

17:58.420 --> 18:02.123
I guess I assume eventually
I'll be rejected,

18:02.191 --> 18:05.726
so I, you know,
test people, push them,

18:05.794 --> 18:08.429
until they prove me right.

18:08.497 --> 18:10.031
It's a sickness.
I admit it.

18:10.098 --> 18:13.501
But this place
has always accepted me,

18:13.569 --> 18:14.602
sickness and all.

18:14.670 --> 18:17.038
This place accepted all of you.

18:17.105 --> 18:18.806
Sickness and all.

18:18.874 --> 18:21.442
It's worth thinking about.

18:21.510 --> 18:23.344
Um, I think we have
thought about it, Pierce,

18:23.412 --> 18:25.646
and you're right.

18:25.714 --> 18:27.582
And we were just picking a class

18:27.649 --> 18:30.985
we could all be in this fall.

18:31.053 --> 18:33.688
And we'd love for you to join us.

18:36.291 --> 18:37.525
No, thanks.

18:37.593 --> 18:39.126
I'm done with you guys.

18:39.194 --> 18:40.495
I like this school,

18:40.562 --> 18:42.697
but I'm done
with whatever you call this.

18:42.764 --> 18:46.968
Adios.

18:47.035 --> 18:48.736
- He was my ride.
- I'm going after him.

18:48.804 --> 18:50.171
No, he's just acting out.

18:50.239 --> 18:52.273
I've seen this behavior before.

18:52.341 --> 18:54.108
In cats.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.611
- My--my cats.
- It's true.

18:56.678 --> 19:01.210
And now he'll come
slinking back in five,

19:01.330 --> 19:05.686
four, three, two...

19:22.671 --> 19:32.499

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

19:38.125 --> 19:39.459
And then
one of the storm troopers

19:39.527 --> 19:41.238
shot the others,
and it was Pierce.

19:41.488 --> 19:43.877
And we won.
We saved Greendale.

19:44.435 --> 19:46.155
- Sounds like you guys had a lot of fun.
- Yep.

19:46.773 --> 19:48.243
Honestly, I don't know how
we're gonna top it next year.

19:48.363 --> 19:50.464
Oh, I got a pitch.
Why use guns?

19:50.584 --> 19:52.501
Take a hose and spray
the whole school with paint.

19:52.621 --> 19:54.251
- Every inch of it.
- Actually, we kind of did that.

19:54.371 --> 19:55.280
Haven't you been to the library?

19:55.400 --> 19:57.078
- I'm working my way there.
- Mm.

20:00.695 --> 20:02.333
Oh, you can just
put that anywhere.

20:08.020 --> 20:09.550
Doing anything fun
for the summer?

20:10.241 --> 20:11.829
- No plans.
- Cool.

20:12.355 --> 20:13.958
Cool, cool, cool.

20:14.078 --> 20:15.311
Slippery.
