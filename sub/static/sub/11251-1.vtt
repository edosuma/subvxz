01:48.600 --> 01:50.200
Ten-hut!

02:18.400 --> 02:20.260
Welcome home, Mr. President.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.900
Over here, Mr. President!

02:23.070 --> 02:24.150
Good to be home.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.440
Thank you.

02:39.540 --> 02:41.950
- What do you got?
- Let's go over it again.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.620
Who do I see first this morning?

02:44.800 --> 02:46.410
You've got Mr. Crenshaw at 11:30.

02:46.590 --> 02:49.710
I can't do two things at once, you know?
I got NSC at 2:30.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.000
- That'll only take half an hour.
- With Syria?

02:52.180 --> 02:54.140
You've got that radio address
to go over...

02:54.310 --> 02:58.100
...and the Legal Counsel speech
at the Monroe tomorrow night.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.010
- The Monroe?
- Welcome home, Mr. President.

03:01.190 --> 03:03.020
Yes, sir, the Monroe Hotel.

03:03.190 --> 03:05.180
Have you got someone to double
for me there?

03:05.360 --> 03:07.320
- We're working on it, sir.
- Good.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.850
Try to find someone
who looks like me this time.

03:12.030 --> 03:14.240
That last guy was a joke.

03:17.410 --> 03:20.000
Ladies and gentlemen, here he is...

03:20.170 --> 03:22.410
...the President of the United States.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.720
God bless you. Thank you.

03:37.890 --> 03:40.630
Welcome to Durenberger's, Mr. President.

03:40.810 --> 03:42.520
Thank you, one and all.

03:42.690 --> 03:46.230
Let me just say,
from one chief executive to another...

03:46.400 --> 03:51.860
...that there is no Chevrolet
like Durenberger's Community Chevrolet.

03:52.030 --> 03:53.770
Thank you, Mr. President.

03:53.950 --> 03:57.070
- Mom, that's not the president, is it?
- I sure hope not.

03:57.240 --> 04:02.360
I have the feeling that when people
find out about the $500 cash rebate...

04:02.540 --> 04:05.580
...on all Geo Storms
and Geo Storm convertibles...

04:05.750 --> 04:07.990
...that you're going to be even busier
than I am.

04:08.170 --> 04:10.160
You said it, Mr. President.

04:11.050 --> 04:14.960
See, I could veto this Simpson-Gardner
thing if I wanted to, but I don't want to.

04:15.140 --> 04:17.170
Do you know why I don't want to?

04:18.140 --> 04:20.130
It's got homeless shelters...

04:20.310 --> 04:22.350
...Head Start centers...

04:22.520 --> 04:23.560
...and, uh....

04:23.730 --> 04:25.190
Hot lunches.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.940
Hot lunches for little kiddies.

04:28.690 --> 04:32.190
If I kill it, I'm gonna look like a prick.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.600
I don't want to look like a prick.

04:35.030 --> 04:36.490
I want you to look like pricks.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.620
But, sir, we've tried to kill it.

04:40.790 --> 04:41.820
Twice.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.790
I don't think so, Howard, no.
If you'd killed it, it would be dead.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.830
When I kill something...

04:48.000 --> 04:49.790
...it always dies.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.830
- Doesn't it, Bob?
- Always did.

04:53.260 --> 04:56.340
Mr. President, with the work your wife
has done with the homeless--

04:56.510 --> 04:58.110
My wife.

04:58.510 --> 04:59.550
Norman.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.930
I don't want you to do this
because you're forced to.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.720
I want you to do this
because you want to.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.480
I want you to do it
because it's the right thing to do.

05:09.650 --> 05:14.110
I want you to do it because you're acting
in the best interests of your country.

05:17.870 --> 05:19.320
Well, I think that's it.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.080
- 6:30?
- Oh-ho!

05:34.260 --> 05:37.050
- Perfect.
- Great. I'll see you then.

05:37.550 --> 05:39.010
- How are you? Having fun?
- Hey.

05:39.180 --> 05:42.170
Yes. Good to see you.

05:42.350 --> 05:43.560
Ask me how I did.

05:43.730 --> 05:46.060
- How did it go? Yeah?
- I killed them. It was great.

05:46.230 --> 05:48.390
- See what you can do in here.
- Okay, what's up?

05:48.560 --> 05:50.850
Hey. How are you, Mabel? Hi, Jennifer.

05:51.020 --> 05:54.520
Mabel says it's too far on the bus.
Jennifer's boss tried to hit on her.

05:54.690 --> 05:57.810
And Lola's been in your office crying
for almost an hour.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.070
Lola, what happened?

05:59.240 --> 06:02.230
Oh, Mr. Kovic, it's not my fault.
I learn on the IBM, okay?

06:02.410 --> 06:04.030
- Yeah.
- Then they put me on the Wang.

06:07.210 --> 06:09.870
Don't worry. We'll think of something.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.660
Yeah. So tonight's the big night.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.250
Yeah. It's some big secret.
He won't tell me.

06:15.420 --> 06:16.880
Can't get out of it.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.670
It's gonna be fine.
We're gonna fix it.

06:19.840 --> 06:23.090
Honey, call, uh, Murray.
Tell him we're on our way, okay?

06:23.260 --> 06:25.300
It's Wednesday.
Everybody works on Wednesday.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.970
Can I borrow your--? Thanks.

06:29.350 --> 06:31.440
Don't cry. Murray.

06:31.610 --> 06:33.890
Dave, I can't hire anybody else. I can't.

06:34.070 --> 06:36.350
Murray, she flies on an IBM.

06:36.530 --> 06:40.360
I don't have enough work
for the people you already gave me.

06:40.530 --> 06:43.200
She's got three kids.
Her husband's a diabetic. Diabetic?

06:46.960 --> 06:49.320
Just a short-term thing.
Straight temp job.

06:50.790 --> 06:54.540
Please? Murray. Murray.

06:54.710 --> 06:56.370
I'll see what I can do.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.180
Thanks.

07:03.010 --> 07:04.630
You feel okay about this?

07:04.810 --> 07:06.300
Not yet.

07:06.470 --> 07:08.140
You will.

07:08.310 --> 07:10.270
Do you want to go play some ball?

07:10.900 --> 07:13.480
It's the middle of the afternoon.
I'm working.

07:13.650 --> 07:16.140
Me too. Okay, well, um, thanks, Murray.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.350
I'll see you tomorrow.

07:17.530 --> 07:20.900
- Bye, Lola, Kate, Adriana, Pam.
- Bye, Dave.

07:23.370 --> 07:25.650
<i>And the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet</i>

07:25.830 --> 07:27.740
<i>When the wind comes right behind the--</i>

07:27.910 --> 07:28.910
Aah!

07:29.120 --> 07:33.630
<i>Rain</i>
<i>Oklahoma</i>

07:33.730 --> 07:35.500
<i>Every night my honey lamb and I</i>

07:36.210 --> 07:38.960
<i>Sit alone and talk and watch a hawk</i>

07:39.130 --> 07:42.500
<i>Makin' lazy circles in the sky</i>

07:42.680 --> 07:45.340
<i>We know we belong to the land</i>

07:45.510 --> 07:48.100
<i>And the land we belong to is grand</i>

07:48.270 --> 07:50.100
<i>And when we say</i>

07:50.270 --> 07:53.680
<i>Yeeow! Ayipioeeay, whoo</i>

07:53.860 --> 07:59.100
<i>We're only saying</i>
<i>You're doing fine, Oklahoma</i>

07:59.780 --> 08:02.780
<i>Oklahoma</i>

08:03.910 --> 08:07.410
<i>O-K-L-A-H-O</i>

08:07.510 --> 08:09.410
<i>M-A</i>

08:09.750 --> 08:12.750
<i>Oklahoma</i>

08:15.250 --> 08:16.960
Mr. Kovic?

08:19.760 --> 08:23.630
I'm Duane Stevenson
with the United States Secret Service.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.340
We're with the federal government.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.800
I.... I swear I thought
that was a legitimate deduction.

08:29.970 --> 08:32.929
See, I do impersonations,
so I use that television with my work.

08:33.100 --> 08:35.809
Mr. Kovic,
we're not here about your taxes.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.559
On occasion, for security purposes...

08:40.740 --> 08:43.900
...the Secret Service hires someone
to double for the president...

08:44.070 --> 08:47.570
...at public functions
in exposed situations.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.400
Your government needs your help.

08:53.710 --> 08:55.110
Really?

09:02.590 --> 09:03.960
I like it.

09:04.130 --> 09:05.470
You look just like him.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.130
- You think?
- Mm-hm.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.040
And the coloring....

09:09.220 --> 09:12.560
- Coloring is excellent.
- You really cut his hair this short?

09:12.730 --> 09:15.060
- It's a perfect match.
- Doesn't come over the ears?

09:15.230 --> 09:18.060
- You understand what you'll be doing?
- Uh, yeah. You want me to wave.

09:18.160 --> 09:21.940
Wave from the door,
come down the stairs, get into the limo.

09:22.110 --> 09:24.480
You know, if you want me
to do other stuff, uh, I can.

09:24.650 --> 09:26.690
- If you want me to talk--
- Don't say a word.

09:26.860 --> 09:27.980
Right.

09:29.660 --> 09:33.700
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

09:57.850 --> 09:59.440
Thank you all.

09:59.610 --> 10:01.270
Thank you.

10:03.230 --> 10:04.650
Is there a lawyer in the house?

10:06.700 --> 10:07.980
You know...

10:08.160 --> 10:10.150
...just now as I was coming
to the podium...

10:10.320 --> 10:12.120
...I spotted my old friend,
Jordan Blankfort.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.330
Now Justice Blankfort...

10:17.460 --> 10:21.200
...who I haven't seen
since our law school days back at Yale.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.590
You know, just seeing him makes me...

10:24.760 --> 10:28.630
...kind of nostalgic
for those innocent days back then.

10:29.140 --> 10:30.920
About the worst thing we ever did...

10:31.100 --> 10:33.550
...was hoist somebody's underwear
up a flagpole.

10:35.140 --> 10:38.730
<i>We need standardized parole criteria...</i>

10:38.900 --> 10:43.270
<i>...that will guarantee a prisoner</i>
<i>will not be returned to the street...</i>

10:43.440 --> 10:48.190
<i>...until he has paid his debt to society.</i>

10:51.200 --> 10:54.070
<i>We need a judiciary</i>
<i>that is sensitive to the needs...</i>

10:54.240 --> 10:55.280
Okay, let's go.

10:55.450 --> 11:01.870
<i>...of the average American,</i>
<i>because that's what we were founded on.</i>

11:04.000 --> 11:05.540
The dreams...

11:05.710 --> 11:07.120
...the dreams of a few...

11:07.300 --> 11:09.340
...struggling pilgrims...

11:09.510 --> 11:12.250
...who imagined a system of laws...

11:12.430 --> 11:15.220
...of the people, by the people...

11:15.390 --> 11:20.100
...and for all the decent people
of this land! God bless you!

11:20.270 --> 11:21.600
God bless America!

11:51.630 --> 11:52.630
Hey.

11:53.550 --> 11:55.010
Let's move it up a half hour.

11:55.180 --> 11:58.720
You have the trade negotiations.
It needs to be handled.

12:06.020 --> 12:07.060
He's here.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.730
They weren't very enthusiastic.

12:10.900 --> 12:12.440
Of course, they're lawyers.

12:18.330 --> 12:20.110
Jesus Christ.

12:50.940 --> 12:52.680
You're a very handsome man.

12:52.860 --> 12:54.730
Thank you, Mr. President.

12:54.910 --> 12:57.940
Just get rid of the grin.
You look like a schmuck.

13:00.540 --> 13:02.030
He's all right.

13:04.120 --> 13:05.960
Wish me luck.

13:06.130 --> 13:07.660
- Call me if there's a war.
- Heh.

13:10.630 --> 13:11.670
Move him out.

13:17.220 --> 13:18.300
You're on.

13:57.340 --> 13:59.800
Okay, you ready?

14:32.170 --> 14:34.000
Mr. President?

14:36.050 --> 14:37.710
President Mitchell!

14:46.430 --> 14:48.770
God bless you! God bless America!

14:57.030 --> 14:58.060
Thank you very much!

15:14.210 --> 15:16.410
I'm sorry. I just couldn't help it.
I got carried away.

15:17.760 --> 15:19.670
I was pretty good though, wasn't I?

15:24.260 --> 15:28.600
I guess something important must be going
on for the president to go through all this.

15:29.980 --> 15:32.440
Something top secret.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.220
Baby?

16:09.350 --> 16:10.350
Hon?

16:16.980 --> 16:18.720
Mr. President?

16:34.170 --> 16:37.130
Doesn't look very good.
They say it hit both sides of his brain.

16:37.290 --> 16:39.160
If he makes it,
he's gonna be a vegetable.

16:39.340 --> 16:41.170
- I can't believe he'd do this.
- I know.

16:41.340 --> 16:43.670
- Where's the girl?
- She's a little upset right now.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.880
- We got her upstairs in the laundry room.
- Some nightmare.

16:47.810 --> 16:48.810
Bob.

16:49.350 --> 16:52.840
At some point,
we're gonna have to call the vice-president.

16:53.020 --> 16:55.890
- Don't call the vice-president.
- What?

16:56.060 --> 16:57.850
Just don't call him, Al.

16:58.020 --> 17:00.190
- The guy's in a coma, Bob.
- I don't give a shit.

17:00.360 --> 17:04.099
- Bob.
- This is mine, Al. It's all mine.

17:04.280 --> 17:07.150
I made him. I built him.

17:07.319 --> 17:10.490
And no Boy Scout is gonna come in here
and take it away from me...

17:10.660 --> 17:13.950
...just because he happens
to be vice-president of the United States.

17:33.770 --> 17:35.260
You know, uh...

17:35.900 --> 17:40.060
...if you guys want to do something for his
birthday, uh, I've got some great birthday stuff.

17:40.230 --> 17:42.770
I do this thing, uh....
My friends love this.

17:44.650 --> 17:47.770
The president and the first lady are going
to Club Med, for their vacation....

17:49.240 --> 17:50.240
Yeah.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.680
Oh, sir.

17:56.830 --> 17:57.830
What?

18:00.840 --> 18:01.840
What?

18:04.170 --> 18:05.170
What?

18:06.970 --> 18:09.000
Back to the cottage.

18:10.100 --> 18:11.100
What?

18:16.270 --> 18:17.880
We'll start by going on television.

18:18.060 --> 18:22.480
We'll admit he had a stroke,
but we'll say it was a mild stroke.

18:22.650 --> 18:24.480
- A mild stroke?
- Yes.

18:24.650 --> 18:28.610
And he ought to be up and around again
sometime soon.

18:28.780 --> 18:29.900
Up and around?

18:31.160 --> 18:32.160
How?

18:38.830 --> 18:40.240
You know...

18:40.420 --> 18:42.160
...I'm not scared.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.790
I think I've been pretty cooperative.
I'd just like to know where we're going.

18:49.970 --> 18:50.970
Nice.

19:03.860 --> 19:06.400
Dave. I'm Alan Reed,
White House communications director.

19:06.570 --> 19:09.440
And this is Bob Alexander,
our chief of staff.

19:09.610 --> 19:12.610
We met earlier at the hotel tonight,
remember?

19:12.780 --> 19:14.990
Can I get you something to drink?

19:15.160 --> 19:17.900
You sure? Coke, mineral water?
Something like that?

19:18.080 --> 19:19.540
I'm fine.

19:21.540 --> 19:25.750
But Dave, something has come up
and I think we need to talk about it.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.090
I'm so sorry.
I know I wasn't supposed to talk...

19:29.260 --> 19:32.300
- ...but I saw the crowd and I got excited--
- Heh.

19:32.470 --> 19:34.590
No, no, no,
we're not upset with you, Dave.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.760
We think you did a terrific job.

19:38.270 --> 19:39.720
Don't we, Bob?

19:40.390 --> 19:43.600
- Terrific.
- In fact, we think you did such a good job...

19:43.770 --> 19:46.260
...that we would like to...

19:46.440 --> 19:48.270
...extend things a little.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.030
- Extend things?
- Yes.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.810
Extend them.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.520
Come here.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.080
Try it out.

20:12.470 --> 20:14.590
- Try it out?
- Go ahead.

20:28.440 --> 20:29.560
How's that feel?

20:29.740 --> 20:30.820
Well, very nice.

20:33.780 --> 20:35.180
Dave...

20:36.330 --> 20:40.160
...the reason we invited you here tonight
is because...

20:40.330 --> 20:42.950
...something has happened
to the president.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.990
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

20:45.170 --> 20:47.710
I know, it's difficult for all of us...

20:47.880 --> 20:51.210
...but sometimes we need to put
our personal feelings aside and focus...

20:51.380 --> 20:53.250
...on the good of the country.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.540
What happened?

20:58.180 --> 21:00.470
It's actually kind of serious, Dave.

21:01.850 --> 21:04.840
I'm afraid the president's
not in very good shape.

21:05.350 --> 21:07.850
- Will he be all right?
- Oh, yeah.

21:08.020 --> 21:09.310
- Probably.
- We think so.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.480
Yes.

21:11.110 --> 21:12.110
Oh.

21:13.780 --> 21:14.780
Dave.

21:17.370 --> 21:19.480
Sometimes we need our friends...

21:19.660 --> 21:21.900
...and even our enemies, to feel...

21:22.080 --> 21:24.070
...safe and secure.

21:24.250 --> 21:27.120
We need them to feel
like they can go to bed at night...

21:27.290 --> 21:31.210
...knowing that President Mitchell
is fully in control.

21:32.300 --> 21:34.840
We need them to feel like...

21:35.010 --> 21:37.920
...he's sitting right here...

21:38.100 --> 21:39.380
...in this chair.

21:41.180 --> 21:42.180
Hey.

21:42.430 --> 21:44.270
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.220
Wait a minute. Uh....

21:50.440 --> 21:52.020
What about the vice-president?

21:52.190 --> 21:53.770
Vice-president?

21:55.860 --> 21:58.360
We didn't want to have to tell you this...

22:03.540 --> 22:05.950
...but the vice-president
is mentally unbalanced.

22:07.830 --> 22:10.700
- No.
- I'm afraid so.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.250
- Really?
- Yes.

22:13.420 --> 22:16.210
- Crazy?
- Certifiable.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.140
How much do you usually get paid?

22:25.060 --> 22:26.520
I don't know.

22:26.690 --> 22:28.220
Depends. Uh...

22:28.400 --> 22:32.360
Usually it's a barter kind of thing.

22:33.940 --> 22:35.100
Is this legal?

22:36.860 --> 22:37.860
Dave.

22:38.740 --> 22:42.450
Have you ever driven through a red light,
huh?

22:42.620 --> 22:45.330
You know, on an empty road...

22:45.500 --> 22:48.490
...when there's nobody around
and you know it's safe?

22:48.670 --> 22:51.250
I'm not sure. I might have.

22:51.420 --> 22:52.950
Well, let's say....

22:53.130 --> 22:56.960
Let's say your mother
is in the car and you...

22:57.130 --> 22:59.470
...have to get her to the hospital.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.050
You'd do it then for sure, wouldn't you?

23:02.510 --> 23:04.350
Yes, I guess I would.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.850
Now, let's say...

23:07.020 --> 23:08.680
...the whole country...

23:08.850 --> 23:10.590
...is in the car.

23:10.770 --> 23:14.110
The entire United States of America.

23:14.980 --> 23:17.320
- In the car?
- In the car.

23:17.990 --> 23:19.600
I see what you mean.

23:20.610 --> 23:21.610
Dave.

23:23.030 --> 23:24.990
The country is sick.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.080
And you're gonna get it to the hospital.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.660
These are the private quarters.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.920
The president's bedroom is on that side,
the first lady's is over there.

23:38.090 --> 23:40.380
- First lady?
- Don't worry, you won't even see her.

23:40.550 --> 23:41.960
They barely talk anymore.

23:42.140 --> 23:44.300
- You're kidding.
- It happens.

23:50.020 --> 23:52.230
And this is where you'll be sleeping.

23:57.530 --> 23:59.390
- Hmm.
- You all right?

23:59.570 --> 24:02.280
- It's very nice.
- Come this way.

24:02.450 --> 24:04.940
I'm sure you'll be comfortable here.

24:05.120 --> 24:08.280
We'll be back to get you first thing
in the morning.

24:08.450 --> 24:11.200
The Secret Service man
is right outside the door.

24:12.500 --> 24:13.710
Good night, Mr. President.

24:14.210 --> 24:15.540
Good night.

24:16.500 --> 24:17.960
Sleep tight.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.290
Thank you.

24:41.070 --> 24:42.070
Whoa.

24:49.540 --> 24:52.030
- Yes, Mr. President.
- Uh, nothing. Good night.

25:05.930 --> 25:07.090
Nothing.

25:07.260 --> 25:08.720
Good night.

25:33.580 --> 25:37.290
At 10:45 last night, President Mitchell,
coming home from the Monroe Hotel...

25:37.460 --> 25:40.420
...where he was giving a speech
to the American Legal Counsel...

25:40.590 --> 25:44.630
...suffered what doctors describe
as a minor circulatory problem of the head.

25:44.800 --> 25:48.460
Reports that he had suffered
a severe stroke are erroneous.

25:48.640 --> 25:52.010
Doctors report that he should be up
and back to his normal schedule soon.

25:52.180 --> 25:55.640
Now, let me stress again,
this is a minor medical problem.

25:55.810 --> 25:58.600
The president has complete use
of his faculties...

25:58.770 --> 26:01.260
...and retains full executive authority.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.520
Any questions?

26:02.690 --> 26:05.190
<i>The White House classifies</i>
<i>the president's condition...</i>

26:05.360 --> 26:08.030
<i>...as a slight circulatory problem</i>
<i>of the head.</i>

26:08.200 --> 26:09.530
<i>While technically a stroke...</i>

26:09.700 --> 26:13.240
<i>... White House spokesmen say the</i>
<i>president's condition is far from serious...</i>

26:13.410 --> 26:15.620
<i>...and he should be up and about</i>
<i>sometime soon.</i>

26:15.790 --> 26:19.200
Do you know how many different kinds
of laws we've broken?

26:21.380 --> 26:23.370
It's simple, Alan.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.420
We send the vice-president
to Africa or something.

26:26.590 --> 26:29.580
We dig up some dirt on him
and then we force him to resign...

26:29.760 --> 26:32.250
...and get our president
to nominate a new one.

26:32.430 --> 26:34.300
The whole thing
takes a couple of weeks.

26:34.470 --> 26:38.180
You mean, we get Dave
to nominate you as vice-president?

26:38.350 --> 26:42.220
- I was a senator, you know?
- Oh, I know.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.140
And when our poor president
has another stroke...

26:45.320 --> 26:47.480
...of course this time
much more serious...

26:47.650 --> 26:50.360
...our newly appointed VP becomes....

26:50.530 --> 26:51.530
Jeez.

26:52.450 --> 26:53.990
What about containment, Al?

26:54.750 --> 26:56.150
Thanks.

26:58.710 --> 27:03.250
Okay. We got the nurses for 50 grand
apiece, and the doctors for 100.

27:03.420 --> 27:06.790
- The older guy wanted head of the CDC.
- Is that everybody?

27:06.970 --> 27:09.460
Duane's guys,
he's got them all under control.

27:09.630 --> 27:11.380
Good. What about her?

27:11.550 --> 27:12.550
Her?

27:12.890 --> 27:15.430
Oh, the first lady?

27:15.600 --> 27:20.390
She was giving a speech at Bryn Mawr.
I managed to catch her before she left.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.560
And?

27:21.940 --> 27:26.520
I told her his blood pressure went up
after a little incident at the hotel.

27:27.030 --> 27:28.860
She seems to hate him now
more than ever.

27:29.030 --> 27:30.030
Fine.

27:30.490 --> 27:34.610
Everybody else is buying
the "minor stroke" story.

27:36.410 --> 27:39.830
Let's hope this yutz can pull it off.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.830
These are amazing results.
I must say, Mr. President...

27:43.000 --> 27:44.830
...even for a man with a minor stroke...

27:45.000 --> 27:47.840
...you seem to have made
a remarkable recovery.

27:48.010 --> 27:49.500
Oh, that's great.

27:49.670 --> 27:51.460
I'm feeling much better.

27:51.640 --> 27:54.720
No signs of paralysis.
No circulatory changes.

27:54.890 --> 27:57.010
Your ECG is completely normal...

27:57.180 --> 28:00.970
...and, uh, your blood pressure
has even gone down.

28:01.140 --> 28:04.010
Have you been exercising recently?

28:05.770 --> 28:07.980
Yes. I mean...

28:08.530 --> 28:10.860
...bicycling and, uh...

28:11.030 --> 28:12.240
...weight lifting.

28:12.410 --> 28:14.320
Looking after the diet. Uh....

28:16.280 --> 28:18.900
Polo, climbing.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.200
Like that.

28:22.370 --> 28:25.870
Well, judging by these tests,
I see no reason why you can't, uh...

28:26.040 --> 28:28.160
...return to work
within the next couple days.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.370
- Great.
- Good.

28:29.550 --> 28:30.550
Good.

28:35.350 --> 28:37.630
- Uh, Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

28:46.150 --> 28:47.560
Hold it.

28:48.230 --> 28:51.600
- Remember everybody's name, faces?
- Yeah.

28:51.780 --> 28:53.310
Keep it simple.

28:53.490 --> 28:56.150
Course. Watch.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.870
- Morning, ladies.
- Mr. President.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.080
Diane.

29:04.250 --> 29:06.210
- Good to see you.
- Well, welcome back, sir.

29:06.380 --> 29:09.370
Good to be back. Just a false alarm.
Nothing to be worried about.

29:10.460 --> 29:12.170
- Clara.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

29:12.340 --> 29:13.830
- Nice to see you.
- You too, sir.

29:14.010 --> 29:16.550
- It's good to be alive, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

29:16.720 --> 29:17.760
Randi.

29:17.930 --> 29:20.890
Oh, good morning, Mr. President.
I was really worried.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.760
- I didn't know what was going on.
- Heh.

29:22.930 --> 29:24.850
I'm so glad that you're feeling better.

29:25.020 --> 29:26.680
- Why didn't you call me?
- Well, uh....

29:26.860 --> 29:28.890
- You really had me worried.
- I'm fine. Well....

29:29.070 --> 29:30.600
I was really worried.

29:30.780 --> 29:32.360
- What's with her?
- Don't worry.

29:32.530 --> 29:34.810
She's emotional.
She's attached to the president.

29:34.990 --> 29:37.480
- Remember, you are the president.
- Ah.

29:37.660 --> 29:39.870
Okay, let's get back to work.

29:40.910 --> 29:43.450
Sick time is done. Let's call the-- Whoa.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.450
False alarm. I'm fine. Everything's fine.

29:49.750 --> 29:51.210
He's okay.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.700
Let's go over it again, huh?

29:53.880 --> 29:56.670
You met a girl. You fell in love.

29:56.840 --> 29:59.130
- And we're going away on a holiday.
- For a month.

29:59.300 --> 30:01.800
- A month?
- Right. Don't embellish.

30:02.770 --> 30:05.760
Um, do I need to dial nine?

30:07.730 --> 30:08.940
As soon as we sat down...

30:09.110 --> 30:11.440
...he pulls out this ring
and I got so emotional...

30:12.820 --> 30:15.260
...that I had to ask the waiter
to bring over another napkin.

30:15.360 --> 30:16.960
Hang on.

30:19.410 --> 30:20.650
Kovic Temps.

30:20.830 --> 30:23.860
Oh, hi, Dave. Where are you?

30:27.960 --> 30:29.620
You met who?

30:32.590 --> 30:34.420
You're going where?

30:35.300 --> 30:36.700
Cancun?

30:39.430 --> 30:41.890
Oh, I think that's great.

30:42.060 --> 30:45.470
She's very special. She's beautiful.
She's a princess.

30:45.640 --> 30:49.600
She's, uh, really exotic and wonderful.
Uh....

30:49.770 --> 30:52.260
She's, uh.... She's Polynesian.

30:52.440 --> 30:56.100
Well, half Polynesian
and, uh, half American.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.610
She's, uh, Amnesian.

30:58.110 --> 30:59.150
Hang up.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.410
Uh, she has a hang-up
about the royalty thing.

31:01.570 --> 31:04.410
- Hang up the phone.
- Don't talk about that when you meet her.

31:04.580 --> 31:07.700
I gotta go now. The plane's leaving.
Call you later. Bye.

31:08.710 --> 31:09.740
It worked.

31:12.420 --> 31:14.330
He's in love.

31:15.550 --> 31:17.210
Thank God.

31:17.380 --> 31:19.210
President continued his convalescence...

31:19.380 --> 31:21.720
...resting in the White House
for the second day.

31:21.890 --> 31:24.970
His personal physician pronounced him
in perfectly good health.

31:25.140 --> 31:27.130
I have examined him thoroughly...

31:27.310 --> 31:31.350
...and I don't believe that I have ever seen
the president in better shape.

31:31.520 --> 31:35.140
<i>The president was able to</i>
<i>attend to some official business on Wednesday...</i>

31:35.320 --> 31:39.110
<i>...and continues to be briefed</i>
<i>on all areas of national concern.</i>

31:39.280 --> 31:41.320
The upper house and the lower house.

31:41.490 --> 31:45.570
Senators are elected to six-year terms
and congressmen are elected to two.

31:45.740 --> 31:46.950
Judiciary?

31:47.580 --> 31:49.240
Veterans Affairs?

31:50.000 --> 31:51.710
- Mark Davis.
- Agriculture.

31:51.880 --> 31:54.460
Agriculture? Uh, uh, uh....

31:54.630 --> 31:56.740
Cows, cows, calves, Metcalf.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.540
Lawrence Metcalf. He's right there.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.960
<i>So confident is the</i>
<i>White House about the president's recovery...</i>

32:02.140 --> 32:06.350
...that the vice-president has been sent
on a 12-nation African goodwill tour.

32:06.510 --> 32:08.970
This is Sander Vanocur
at the White House.

32:09.140 --> 32:11.130
First thing we'll go over
is the mannerisms.

32:11.310 --> 32:13.470
Alan has worked out
a sort of training program.

32:13.650 --> 32:15.890
- Great.
- This is the briefing room.

32:16.070 --> 32:19.150
It's where the president
holds most of his press conferences.

32:19.320 --> 32:21.310
This may seem a bit strange at first...

32:21.490 --> 32:25.610
...but, uh, even professional politicians
have trouble getting used to the--

32:25.780 --> 32:27.700
A teleprompter.

32:27.870 --> 32:31.450
- A teleprompter. Is it hooked up?
- No, I don't think so.

32:33.420 --> 32:36.710
As I was saying, nobody expects you
to be Bill Mitchell overnight.

32:36.880 --> 32:40.000
The most important thing
to remember is his general presence.

32:40.170 --> 32:41.460
- Presence.
- Right.

32:41.630 --> 32:43.420
Now, whenever he stands
at a podium...

32:43.590 --> 32:47.630
...President Mitchell always has one hand
in the pocket of his coat.

32:47.810 --> 32:51.430
That's at a press conference. Otherwise,
they're almost always on the podium.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.890
Um, I'm not certain about that.

32:54.060 --> 32:55.520
Remember the convention speech?

32:55.690 --> 32:58.850
"An America,
stronger than the one we were given.

32:59.030 --> 33:01.940
An America,
prouder than the one we found."

33:03.240 --> 33:05.700
Right on the podium.
Except on "America," he points.

33:05.870 --> 33:07.650
You know, that is very good.

33:07.830 --> 33:09.190
Oh, I love that speech.

33:09.370 --> 33:10.580
Thanks. I wrote it.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.780
- You did?
- Yeah.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.620
It's great.

33:14.790 --> 33:17.910
"Somewhere, there is a distant light...

33:18.090 --> 33:21.830
...guiding us through this rocky shoal.

33:22.340 --> 33:25.960
America isn't what we say here tonight.

33:26.140 --> 33:31.180
It's in the faces and the smiles
of a Sunday afternoon.

33:31.350 --> 33:33.340
It's in the gentle kindness...

33:33.520 --> 33:35.380
...of the family kitchen...

33:35.560 --> 33:37.800
...as we gather together...

33:38.900 --> 33:41.110
...when the sun goes down."

33:47.320 --> 33:48.530
Can I keep this?

33:55.960 --> 33:58.320
- Thought I wasn't gonna see her.
- It's five minutes.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.830
She walks in, you wave to the press,
she leaves.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.920
The first lady. I mean, uh,
couldn't I start with a cousin?

34:04.090 --> 34:07.050
She hardly ever sees him.
She won't have a chance to tell.

34:07.220 --> 34:08.750
Stop whining.

34:08.929 --> 34:11.719
If you can convince her,
you can convince anybody.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.260
All right.

34:14.810 --> 34:17.020
We're ready for Mrs. Mitchell.

34:19.440 --> 34:22.270
As soon as she comes in,
we'll move you out to the balcony.

34:22.440 --> 34:26.650
All you have to say is,
"Thanks for doing this, Ellen."

34:26.820 --> 34:28.730
- "Thanks for doing this, Ellen."
- Exactly.

34:29.909 --> 34:32.620
She doesn't always like this stuff.
It might soften her up.

34:32.790 --> 34:34.870
"Thanks for doing this, Ellen."

34:38.830 --> 34:42.750
Why can't you die from a stroke
like everybody else?

34:49.300 --> 34:50.960
What are you staring at?

34:52.679 --> 34:56.920
Uh, ah, Mrs. Mitchell,
we're gonna do it right out here.

34:58.520 --> 35:00.140
Who was she?

35:01.150 --> 35:04.020
Another patriotic secretary?

35:04.440 --> 35:05.440
Hmm?

35:07.650 --> 35:09.240
Thank you for doing this, Ellen.

35:10.320 --> 35:11.690
Go to hell, Bill.

35:13.490 --> 35:16.110
- I think we can get started now.
- Oh.

35:16.290 --> 35:19.580
You can tell these two pit vipers
that this is the last one of these...

35:19.750 --> 35:21.870
...I'll be doing for a while.

35:22.290 --> 35:23.290
Okay.

35:26.710 --> 35:28.210
You're doing just fine.

35:43.650 --> 35:44.650
Wave.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.020
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

35:48.190 --> 35:49.860
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

35:50.030 --> 35:52.240
- Mr. President, how are you feeling?
- Fine.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.940
- Fine.
- Ready to get back to work?

35:56.540 --> 35:57.870
You bet.

35:58.040 --> 35:59.370
You bet.

35:59.540 --> 36:00.660
I'm out of here.

36:00.830 --> 36:01.830
Shit.

36:03.330 --> 36:05.790
Will you be making decisions?
Are you back in charge?

36:05.960 --> 36:08.080
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

36:08.260 --> 36:09.750
- Go!
- Go, go.

36:09.920 --> 36:10.960
Go, go, go.

36:22.810 --> 36:24.600
Don't you have anything to say to me?

36:28.110 --> 36:30.600
Thank you for doing this, Ellen.

36:32.410 --> 36:34.570
You don't change, do you, Bill?

36:39.450 --> 36:41.490
She hates me.

36:41.660 --> 36:42.660
Yes.

36:44.130 --> 36:47.370
Wave to the camera. Wave to the camera.

37:10.150 --> 37:12.190
Okay. Okay.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.820
Here we go. First off,
we're gonna talk to Ted...

37:14.990 --> 37:18.200
...on the, uh, new
Land Management Legislation.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.160
- Ted.
- Yes, sir.

37:20.330 --> 37:23.490
I think if you refer to Item 3
on the memorandum...

37:23.670 --> 37:26.330
...you'll be delighted to notice that the....

37:26.880 --> 37:28.870
Mr. President, slip your arms in there...

37:29.050 --> 37:32.130
...and the machine will do everything
your arms do.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.130
I once caught a fish...

37:42.430 --> 37:44.550
...this big.

37:46.520 --> 37:47.640
This is great.

37:52.650 --> 37:55.020
<i>Louie, Louie</i>

37:55.200 --> 37:56.730
<i>Whoa, baby</i>

37:56.910 --> 37:57.990
Everybody!

37:58.160 --> 38:00.020
<i>- We gotta go</i>
- Yeah!

38:00.200 --> 38:01.690
<i>Aye-yi-yi-yi</i>

38:02.580 --> 38:04.290
Good boy!

38:04.460 --> 38:06.540
Whoa! Ha, ha.

38:08.790 --> 38:09.870
Got you!

38:10.040 --> 38:13.410
This guy has had a rebirth.
This is a different fella in the White House.

38:13.590 --> 38:16.130
It doesn't happen often, Bob,
but you're right.

38:16.300 --> 38:19.670
There's a transformation. Don't know
what they're putting in the water.

38:19.850 --> 38:22.180
Nothing to do the water
or anything else you drank.

38:22.350 --> 38:26.310
He has faced death in the eye
and been transformed by it.

38:26.480 --> 38:29.390
- Your boss looks better since the stroke.
- Thanks, Mr. Speaker.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.020
- He's doing well.
- Thanks.

38:31.190 --> 38:32.730
- Tell him I send my best.
- I will.

38:32.900 --> 38:34.810
- Good luck.
- Good to see you.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.480
Let me ask you a question now
right off the bat.

38:39.660 --> 38:42.150
What is with President Mitchell lately,
huh?

38:42.330 --> 38:45.160
Has this guy been having too many
Happy Meals for lunch or what?

38:46.870 --> 38:49.710
Let's talk a little bit about desserts.

38:49.880 --> 38:54.210
What you don't want to do
is eat doughnuts.

38:54.380 --> 38:55.420
No doughnuts.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.130
Thank you, Arnold.

38:58.930 --> 39:00.960
Arnold, thank you so much.

39:01.140 --> 39:03.250
- Want to Indian-wrestle?
- Heh.

39:03.430 --> 39:04.430
Whoa!

39:06.310 --> 39:09.430
<i>Throwing out the ceremonial first pitch...</i>

39:09.600 --> 39:11.890
<i>...the President of the United States.</i>

39:46.390 --> 39:49.630
From the nation's capital,
<i>The McLaughlin Group.</i>

39:49.810 --> 39:53.600
An unrehearsed program presenting
inside opinions and forecasts...

39:53.770 --> 39:56.610
...on major issues of the day.

39:56.780 --> 39:59.060
Here's the moderator, John McLaughlin.

39:59.240 --> 40:02.480
Issue one, the new Bill Mitchell.

40:02.660 --> 40:04.490
Two weeks after his brush with death...

40:04.660 --> 40:07.370
...the president is suddenly bounding
around the country...

40:07.540 --> 40:09.780
...with the energy
of a high-school track star.

40:09.960 --> 40:11.990
Is this merely overcompensation...

40:12.170 --> 40:15.750
...or the indefatigable greatness
of a truly great man?

40:15.920 --> 40:17.250
<i>Freddie Barnes?</i>

40:17.420 --> 40:20.840
<i>John, the illness just crystallized</i>
<i>his thinking about his own presidency.</i>

40:21.010 --> 40:22.920
<i>He realized he didn't have</i>
<i>to be a zombie.</i>

40:23.090 --> 40:25.380
<i>He can show some life,</i>
<i>even act like a child.</i>

40:25.560 --> 40:28.640
<i>He's showing the strength of character</i>
<i>he did after he got elected.</i>

40:28.810 --> 40:31.890
<i>The guy got sick, right?</i>
<i>He recovered from his illness.</i>

40:32.060 --> 40:33.970
<i>He is now rejuvenated.</i>

40:34.150 --> 40:37.480
<i>On a political rehabilitation</i>
<i>scale of zero to ten...</i>

40:37.650 --> 40:40.140
<i>...rate the rehabilitation of our president.</i>

40:40.320 --> 40:42.400
<i>It's an eight. The zombie is gone.</i>

40:42.570 --> 40:44.660
<i>It's a three. The zombie will return.</i>

40:44.820 --> 40:46.440
<i>- Chris.</i>
<i>- I think it's 86.</i>

40:46.620 --> 40:50.910
<i>- He's still out to lunch, but looking good.</i>
<i>- The answer is eight.</i>

42:01.730 --> 42:03.020
So the, uh...

42:04.400 --> 42:06.770
...first lady and the president....

42:07.740 --> 42:10.700
What is that?
How long has that been going on?

42:11.040 --> 42:12.450
I can't say.

42:13.660 --> 42:16.330
You mean, you don't know
or you can't say?

42:17.580 --> 42:18.620
I can't say.

42:19.630 --> 42:22.430
Ah, can't say.

42:27.890 --> 42:32.550
So, uh, your job is to protect the president
all the time? That's your whole job?

42:32.720 --> 42:33.720
Yes.

42:37.140 --> 42:39.350
- Have a gun?
- Yes.

42:41.070 --> 42:42.600
Ever use it?

42:43.940 --> 42:45.060
Not yet.

42:55.160 --> 42:57.280
You know, I've always wondered
about you guys.

42:57.460 --> 43:00.200
The way they say you'd take a bullet
for the president.

43:00.380 --> 43:01.410
What about it?

43:02.250 --> 43:03.960
Is that really true?

43:04.130 --> 43:07.290
I mean, would you let yourself be killed
to save his life?

43:07.470 --> 43:08.670
Certainly.

43:14.270 --> 43:18.380
So that means now you would
get killed for me too.

43:32.200 --> 43:35.070
It would be wonderful for you
and great for the president.

43:35.240 --> 43:38.450
I'm sorry, the only time that I have available
is the 25th.

43:38.620 --> 43:40.860
- You out of your mind?
- That's the best I can do.

43:41.040 --> 43:43.200
I'm gonna get back to you.
I gotta go. Bye.

43:43.380 --> 43:45.660
You scheduled a whole day
with the first lady?

43:45.840 --> 43:48.000
- It's a homeless shelter.
- Oh, excuse me.

43:48.170 --> 43:49.290
It's gonna be great.

43:49.470 --> 43:52.210
Caring about his wife,
spending time on her favorite issues.

43:52.390 --> 43:56.130
I don't want him caring about his wife.
What about the vice-president?

43:57.350 --> 43:58.680
The vice-president?

43:58.850 --> 44:02.310
Well, you, uh, remember that First Liberty stuff
we almost got nailed on?

44:02.480 --> 44:03.480
Yeah.

44:05.070 --> 44:07.980
I just dumped it on him instead.

44:09.280 --> 44:10.940
- When does it break?
- Couple of days.

44:11.110 --> 44:14.030
Look at Dave's tracking polls.
They'll burn up in your hands.

44:14.200 --> 44:17.440
Seventy-three percent with seniors,
84 with working mothers.

44:17.620 --> 44:19.950
Alan, we still gotta control this guy.

44:30.420 --> 44:32.760
Why are you doing this, Bill?

44:32.930 --> 44:33.930
What?

44:34.140 --> 44:37.300
Since when do you care
about the homeless?

44:37.520 --> 44:39.720
- I care about the homeless.
- Oh, yeah.

44:39.890 --> 44:42.730
I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.

45:09.340 --> 45:14.000
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. President.

45:14.180 --> 45:19.220
Good morning, kids. How are you?
Thank you for that nice welcome.

45:23.520 --> 45:25.260
They're all kids.

45:25.440 --> 45:29.230
That's right, Bill. Kids are homeless too.

45:29.400 --> 45:30.640
- Where are the parents?
- H i.

45:30.820 --> 45:34.980
A lot of them are in shelters,
but some of them are still out on the street.

45:35.160 --> 45:36.820
Shake hands with the president.

45:36.990 --> 45:39.830
- Hi, there.
- How are you?

45:39.990 --> 45:41.910
- Hello, Mr. President.
- Hello.

45:43.290 --> 45:44.660
- What's your name?
- Brandon.

45:44.830 --> 45:46.290
How do you do?

45:47.380 --> 45:50.080
One of the things that happens
when kids become homeless...

45:50.250 --> 45:52.460
...is they start
to lose communication skills.

45:52.630 --> 45:55.000
So here at Helping Hand,
they play a lot of games...

45:55.180 --> 46:00.140
...that encourage the kids to relate
to each other and to express themselves.

46:00.310 --> 46:03.710
Oh, no, poor Joe.

46:03.890 --> 46:06.890
He has no hair.

46:08.310 --> 46:10.770
Oh, no, poor Joe.

46:11.320 --> 46:12.400
He has no--

46:12.570 --> 46:13.570
Eyes.

46:14.240 --> 46:16.600
Right. Very good.
Very good. Let's try one more.

46:16.780 --> 46:19.360
Everybody together now.
Everybody pay attention.

46:19.530 --> 46:22.990
Here we go. Oh, no, poor Joe.

46:23.160 --> 46:24.950
- He has no--
- Feet.

46:26.420 --> 46:29.620
Great, great, great. All right.

46:33.380 --> 46:34.840
Hi, there.

46:36.260 --> 46:37.920
What's your name?

46:38.840 --> 46:41.210
- David.
- David?

46:41.390 --> 46:43.130
Great name.

46:45.600 --> 46:48.220
What are you doing over here, David?

46:48.400 --> 46:50.000
Nothing.

46:52.190 --> 46:54.930
Hey, guys. Not now, okay?

46:55.530 --> 46:56.930
Thanks.

47:01.450 --> 47:04.030
Don't you like playing games
with the other kids?

47:04.370 --> 47:05.370
No.

47:08.370 --> 47:09.660
Do you like magic?

47:09.830 --> 47:11.240
It's okay.

47:11.420 --> 47:12.420
Okay.

47:13.300 --> 47:14.910
Watch this.

47:20.470 --> 47:21.680
Where'd it go?

47:21.850 --> 47:23.460
The answer is in this riddle.

47:23.640 --> 47:26.430
What can run all day
without ever getting tired?

47:27.310 --> 47:28.680
Do you know?

47:29.400 --> 47:30.930
I'll give you a hint.

47:31.110 --> 47:33.020
It's not your ear.

47:33.570 --> 47:34.900
And it's not your mouth.

47:35.900 --> 47:37.230
My nose.

47:37.400 --> 47:39.440
Your nose. Exactly.

47:39.610 --> 47:41.860
And look, oh, there it is.

47:42.030 --> 47:44.190
See? It was there all the time.

47:44.370 --> 47:45.480
It went up in the air.

47:48.750 --> 47:50.860
And fell on my nose.

47:52.500 --> 47:53.500
Yeah.

47:55.340 --> 47:57.370
Is the first lady still there?

47:58.050 --> 47:59.250
Mm-hm.

47:59.510 --> 48:01.120
Does she look mad?

48:02.140 --> 48:04.720
- Hmm, not really.
- Good.

48:05.600 --> 48:08.640
First cover of <i>Time</i> magazine
and I need a shave.

48:09.770 --> 48:12.010
Tough little moment with the dog.

48:12.190 --> 48:13.930
Here you are on the cover.

48:14.110 --> 48:15.600
- Oh, yeah?
- Front page.

48:15.770 --> 48:17.890
- That's you right behind me.
- Where, what?

48:18.070 --> 48:19.980
See? Okay, here's me.

48:20.150 --> 48:21.190
Now look over here.

48:21.360 --> 48:24.900
You see those 20 guys and then, bing,
there you are right behind the machine.

48:25.080 --> 48:27.410
- That's me?
- Yeah, looking very strong and, uh...

48:27.580 --> 48:29.110
...forbidding.

48:30.290 --> 48:32.410
Have you ever thought
about wearing a sweater?

48:32.580 --> 48:34.670
Just kind of blend in more. Um....

48:35.750 --> 48:38.750
Stand up. There you are again,
coming off the helicopter.

48:38.920 --> 48:41.960
Sweaters make my neck look too thick.

48:42.130 --> 48:44.880
Really? You got a sweater vest?
You could wear a tie.

48:45.050 --> 48:47.090
Think a sweater vest
would look good on me?

48:52.060 --> 48:54.390
Do you have the paperwork
on Simpson-Gardner?

48:54.560 --> 48:57.430
Uh, excuse me.
Yeah, hold on. It's right here.

48:57.610 --> 49:00.600
- Just came in.
- I think he's gonna veto it.

49:14.420 --> 49:17.620
Bill Mitchell...

49:22.340 --> 49:24.550
...votes no.

49:31.810 --> 49:35.890
<i>Hail to the chief</i>
<i>He's the one we all say "Hail" to</i>

49:36.060 --> 49:40.400
<i>We all say "Hail"</i>
<i>Because he keeps himself so clean</i>

49:40.570 --> 49:45.730
<i>He's got the power</i>
<i>That's why he's in the shower</i>

49:45.910 --> 49:47.150
<i>And he's just</i>

49:47.320 --> 49:50.030
I can't believe you would do
something like this.

49:50.200 --> 49:51.280
- Not even you.
- Aah!

49:51.950 --> 49:53.790
How could you?

49:54.960 --> 49:56.740
- How could I what?
- Don't patronize me.

49:56.920 --> 49:58.620
I'm not one of your little bimbos.

50:00.340 --> 50:02.450
And turn around.

50:02.630 --> 50:05.420
I'm talking to you.
Will you please turn around?

50:08.470 --> 50:10.260
Turn around.

50:16.100 --> 50:18.690
You know, if you want
to be the same old selfish...

50:18.860 --> 50:20.720
...bastard, um...

50:22.150 --> 50:23.690
...go ahead. I've gotten used to that.

50:23.860 --> 50:27.780
But don't put on this "man of the people"
routine and then do something like this.

50:28.700 --> 50:29.910
I don't understand.

50:30.080 --> 50:32.660
You know very well
that was not a Works Bill you vetoed.

50:32.830 --> 50:35.200
That would've given
those children homes.

50:35.370 --> 50:39.990
When I think of that spectacle you put on
with the little boy and the magic trick.

50:40.170 --> 50:42.580
Wait a minute.
What's wrong with the magic trick?

50:42.750 --> 50:45.920
It was some magic.
You made their funding disappear.

50:46.090 --> 50:48.080
Look, if there's been some mistake--

50:48.260 --> 50:49.590
There's no mistake, Bill.

50:49.760 --> 50:52.050
When you veto their funding,
that's not a mistake.

50:52.220 --> 50:55.840
When you hurt someone intentionally,
that is not a mistake.

50:56.980 --> 50:58.340
Look....

50:58.650 --> 51:01.100
Ellen. Ellen!

51:07.200 --> 51:11.200
Ellen. Ellen. Ellen.

51:14.700 --> 51:17.200
Call Bob. Call Alan.
Tell them I want to see them now.

51:17.370 --> 51:19.110
But it's 10:30 at night.

51:19.290 --> 51:20.910
You got it.

51:28.090 --> 51:31.580
What the hell is this?

51:31.760 --> 51:33.000
<i>The New York Times.</i>

51:33.180 --> 51:34.980
No, this.

51:36.230 --> 51:38.560
"President vetoes Works Bill."

51:38.730 --> 51:39.810
We vetoed that?

51:39.980 --> 51:40.980
No.

51:41.400 --> 51:43.100
We didn't veto anything.

51:43.270 --> 51:47.110
Dave, these things get awfully complicated
sometimes, and I think you have to--

51:47.280 --> 51:48.640
That shelter was in this bill.

51:48.820 --> 51:51.440
- Take care of this.
- Believe me, Dave, if we could have--

51:51.620 --> 51:53.230
Lots of shelters were in this bill.

51:53.410 --> 51:55.740
- Listen, you little shit.
- Dave. Dave.

51:55.910 --> 51:59.750
The budget is a very complicated thing.
Even I don't understand it sometimes.

51:59.920 --> 52:02.410
Occasionally, we have to make some cuts.
And in order--

52:02.580 --> 52:04.420
- But we went there.
- Dave.

52:04.590 --> 52:07.800
- We saw those kids.
- Yes, you did.

52:07.970 --> 52:11.460
And if you can find a way to cut
$650 million from the federal budget...

52:11.640 --> 52:13.590
...you can keep your lousy shelters.

52:15.890 --> 52:16.890
Okay.

52:19.270 --> 52:21.480
Oh, and by the way...

52:21.650 --> 52:24.390
...don't you ever send for me again.

52:44.250 --> 52:46.830
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see the president.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.210
Is that right?

52:48.380 --> 52:49.670
He asked me to come.

52:49.840 --> 52:53.580
- And your name?
- Blum. Blum. Murray Blum. B-L-U-M.

52:53.760 --> 52:55.470
- Come on, Dave.
- Sit down. It's okay.

52:55.640 --> 52:57.090
- Sit down.
- I don't want to sit.

52:57.260 --> 52:59.630
- I don't want to. Please.
- Murray, come on.

52:59.810 --> 53:01.300
Okay, fine.

53:02.310 --> 53:04.550
This place is probably bugged.

53:04.730 --> 53:08.310
It's not bugged. It's okay, Murray.

53:13.160 --> 53:16.360
You could get in so much trouble
if they find out.

53:16.530 --> 53:18.620
- With who?
- The government.

53:18.790 --> 53:20.820
I'm the government.

53:22.580 --> 53:24.240
Wild, huh?

53:24.920 --> 53:29.160
Murray, I can't tell you the whole story.
It's kind of a national emergency thing.

53:29.340 --> 53:31.130
You've gotta help me cut the budget.

53:33.340 --> 53:35.000
You gotta cut the budget?

53:35.180 --> 53:38.840
Yeah. About $650 million.

53:40.770 --> 53:42.300
You look hungry.

53:44.230 --> 53:46.640
Diane, could you come in here
for a minute?

53:47.190 --> 53:48.810
Just watch.

53:49.860 --> 53:52.980
- Yes, Mr. President?
- Yes, uh, we need two copies of the budget.

53:53.150 --> 53:56.400
And, uh, could you arrange for dinner for two
in the dining room?

53:56.570 --> 53:57.610
Right away, sir.

53:57.780 --> 54:00.150
And we have work to do
so we're not to be disturbed.

54:00.330 --> 54:02.490
- I understand, sir.
- Oh, and, uh....

54:02.660 --> 54:06.750
Do you think they could, uh, rustle up some
fresh bratwurst and some hot mustard?

54:06.920 --> 54:09.530
- I think that can be arranged.
- Thanks, Diane.

54:11.960 --> 54:15.580
- I love bratwurst.
- I know.

54:15.760 --> 54:18.590
Dave, I've been over this a bunch
of times. It doesn't add up.

54:18.760 --> 54:23.850
Who does these books? If I ran my
business this way, I'd be out of business.

54:27.400 --> 54:28.600
So, what can we do?

54:28.770 --> 54:32.020
I see a lot of places you could save,
but I can't make those choices.

54:32.190 --> 54:34.610
I'm not the president. I mean....

54:34.780 --> 54:39.270
You know, I mean, I'm not, uh, the one,
you know, pretending to be the president.

54:39.450 --> 54:40.450
Ah.

54:41.120 --> 54:42.580
I understand.

54:44.710 --> 54:46.490
Let me give it a try.

54:47.790 --> 54:50.580
- You?
- Yeah.

54:51.920 --> 54:53.290
Let me try.

54:55.090 --> 54:56.550
- Okay. You want to try?
- Yeah.

54:56.720 --> 54:59.880
All right. All right.
Here's something right here.

55:00.050 --> 55:01.210
Look at that.

55:14.230 --> 55:16.320
Good morning, Bob. How are you?

55:16.530 --> 55:17.860
All right.

55:18.030 --> 55:19.440
Good morning.

55:20.160 --> 55:21.160
Drew.

55:22.530 --> 55:24.450
It's a work of art.

55:24.950 --> 55:29.990
Look at this. "Vice-president's office linked
to S&L scandal." Alan, you're a genius.

55:30.170 --> 55:31.410
We're on our way.

55:31.590 --> 55:33.330
Say, what's with the cameras?

55:33.500 --> 55:35.750
Hundredth cabinet meeting.
It'll be a nice touch.

55:35.920 --> 55:37.210
- Oh, right.
- Morning.

55:37.380 --> 55:39.370
Good morning.

55:40.260 --> 55:41.800
Morning.

55:41.970 --> 55:44.090
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

55:44.260 --> 55:46.260
- How is everyone?
- Fine, thank you.

55:46.430 --> 55:47.800
Good, ahem.

55:52.730 --> 55:55.220
Okay. Before we get started, uh...

55:55.400 --> 55:58.270
- ...I'd like to go over the budget.
- Budget?

55:58.450 --> 56:01.400
- Do we have anything on the budget today?
- No, I don't think so.

56:03.910 --> 56:05.490
Now, I, uh....

56:05.660 --> 56:08.820
I think I've found some ways to put back
the homeless section...

56:09.000 --> 56:10.700
...of the Simpson-Gardner Works Bill.

56:10.870 --> 56:14.080
Mr. President, I don't believe
that's on your agenda today.

56:15.170 --> 56:17.630
No, it's a last minute change, Bob.

56:19.970 --> 56:25.380
Uh, now, uh, the way I see it,
we need $650 million in order to, uh...

56:25.560 --> 56:27.470
...keep the project.

56:28.180 --> 56:30.640
Now, some of this can be done.

56:30.810 --> 56:32.770
- Uh, through simple changes...
- It's all right.

56:32.940 --> 56:35.100
...in our cash management.

56:35.270 --> 56:36.760
Uh, for example...

56:36.940 --> 56:40.650
...uh, according to the OMB,
we've got, uh, 17 defense contractors...

56:40.820 --> 56:42.860
...who are delinquent in their contracts.

56:43.030 --> 56:44.360
Uh, now, is this true, Frank?

56:44.530 --> 56:46.450
Uh, I believe so, yes.

56:46.620 --> 56:49.080
So even though they're late...

56:49.250 --> 56:51.030
...we keep paying them on time?

56:51.620 --> 56:53.710
Well, in a sense....

56:57.500 --> 56:58.500
Yeah.

56:58.840 --> 57:01.500
Okay, now,
instead of giving them money...

57:01.680 --> 57:03.590
...for something they haven't finished...

57:03.760 --> 57:06.670
...we could hold back that cash,
stick it in interest-bearing--

57:06.850 --> 57:08.260
Mr. President.

57:09.930 --> 57:10.930
Yes.

57:16.940 --> 57:17.980
Nothing.

57:20.570 --> 57:21.770
Great.

57:22.570 --> 57:24.530
Uh, like I was saying, if we took that cash...

57:24.700 --> 57:27.240
...and stuck it
in even an ordinary savings account...

57:27.410 --> 57:31.120
...we'd be making
$23 million a month in interest.

57:31.290 --> 57:34.000
Well, technically, that's true, but, uh....

57:34.170 --> 57:35.170
Oh.

57:38.300 --> 57:40.040
I suppose it's true.

57:40.210 --> 57:42.410
Okay. Okay.

57:42.920 --> 57:46.130
Okay, so that's $23 million...

57:48.560 --> 57:50.920
...times 12 months.

57:51.600 --> 57:53.590
Okay. Good.

57:53.770 --> 57:54.850
Uh....

57:55.020 --> 57:58.860
Unfortunately, money management's
only gonna get us halfway to our goal.

57:59.020 --> 58:01.690
In order to get the rest of the money,
we're gonna have...

58:01.860 --> 58:04.480
...to start making some tough choices.

58:04.650 --> 58:05.770
Uh, the Commerce Department.

58:06.870 --> 58:08.450
Yes, Mr. President?

58:08.620 --> 58:13.410
Uh, you're spending $47 million
on an ad campaign...

58:13.580 --> 58:16.990
..."to boost consumer confidence
in the American auto industry."

58:17.170 --> 58:18.780
Yes, sir, uh....

58:19.750 --> 58:22.670
It's designed to bolster
individual, uh, confidence...

58:22.840 --> 58:25.960
...in a previous domestic
automotive purchase.

58:26.130 --> 58:29.170
So we're spending $47 million
so that somebody can feel better...

58:29.350 --> 58:31.300
...about a car
that they've already bought?

58:31.470 --> 58:35.470
- Yes, but I wouldn't categorize it that way.
- No, no, I'm sure that's important...

58:35.640 --> 58:39.510
...but I don't want to tell some 8-year-old
kid he's gotta sleep in the street...

58:39.690 --> 58:42.850
...because we want people
to feel better about their car.

58:45.400 --> 58:46.940
Do you want to tell him that?

58:49.780 --> 58:51.320
No, sir.

58:52.330 --> 58:54.660
No, I sure don't.

58:54.830 --> 58:57.700
Of course not.
Well, then, that's another 47 million.

58:57.870 --> 59:01.330
So this is good. We're doing good.
We're doing real good. We're on our way.

59:01.500 --> 59:04.670
Okay, let me just add that, uh,
to the tally here.

59:04.840 --> 59:07.170
That'll be plus 47....

59:07.340 --> 59:08.340
Nine.

59:10.350 --> 59:12.180
Five, carry the one...

59:12.350 --> 59:16.010
...makes $656 million...

59:16.180 --> 59:19.050
...which means we can keep the program.

59:29.280 --> 59:31.740
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you for your help.

59:31.910 --> 59:33.400
Well done.

59:33.700 --> 59:35.070
Thanks.

59:35.830 --> 59:37.490
Thank you.

59:46.170 --> 59:47.790
Uh, excuse me.

59:47.970 --> 59:49.170
Um....

59:49.510 --> 59:51.340
- Mrs. Mitchell.
- What is it, Jeff?

59:52.300 --> 59:55.220
You're not gonna believe
what your husband just did.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.850
I'm gonna kill him.

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:04.430
You can't kill a president.

01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:06.720
He's not a president.
He's an ordinary person.

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.360
I can kill an ordinary person.

01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:10.860
- Bob.
- I can kill 100 ordinary people.

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:12.030
Bob.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.700
He's only doing what you told him to do.

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:16.080
What I told him to?

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.860
I heard you. You said, "Cut $650 million
off the federal budget...

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.620
- ...and you can keep your shelters."
- I didn't mean it.

01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:25.500
Why would I want
to save a homeless shelter?

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:26.960
He was only doing his job.

01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:29.920
His job? His job? It's not his job!
It's my job!

01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:31.090
Bob.

01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:34.050
Will you calm down?

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:37.760
Was he on the Trilateral Commission?
Was he a senator?

01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:40.640
Was he in "Who's Who"
nine years in a row? Hello, Judy.

01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:42.600
- Hi, Judy.
- Hi.

01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:45.430
- I'll destroy him. I'll shred the bastard.
- Don't do this.

01:00:45.610 --> 01:00:48.650
- I'll lock him away for good.
- Then we'll all go to jail together.

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.830
What do you mean by that?

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:06.120
Just what you think I mean.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.580
Are you threatening me?

01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:14.150
Well....

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:16.720
Yeah.

01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:19.510
I guess I am.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.430
Thanks, Murray.

01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:28.440
You did great.

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:38.230
Hey, maybe you can come back sometime.
We can go to, uh, Camp David or something.

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:40.370
- Camp David?
- Yeah.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.540
Get out of here as fast as you can.

01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:08.770
Come on, seven.

01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:12.150
Come on, number six.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:28.910
We both lose.

01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:30.710
We both lose.

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:35.880
I saw your light was on, so I just....

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.260
Mind if I sit down?

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:41.550
Uh....

01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:44.010
No. Please.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.090
Would you like, uh....

01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:50.680
No, thanks.

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:04.160
That was quite a thing you did today.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.950
Anyone would've done that.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.210
I don't think so.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.460
You helped a lot of people.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.130
You know...

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.040
...it kind of reminded me...

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:26.220
...of that thing you did a long time ago
in the state legislature.

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.220
Oh, yeah.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.390
Hmm, me too.

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.900
You weren't in the state legislature.

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:43.910
Hi, I'm Ellen Mitchell.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.070
Who are you?

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.460
Look, I'll make this easy on you.

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:57.660
I never see him anymore.

01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:01.420
I barely know him anymore.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.390
I'd just kind of like to know where he is.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.100
This could get me into a lot of trouble.

01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:43.300
Open it, please, Duane.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.810
Oh, my God.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.770
I'm sorry, you're not allowed in here.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:00.560
- Mr. Alexander left strict instructions.
- I'll explain it to you later.

01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:05.770
Oh, no.

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:34.760
What happened?

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:36.890
It was a stroke.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.230
It's pretty bad.

01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:47.020
I don't understand.

01:05:48.330 --> 01:05:50.240
Is he going to...?

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.950
I'm sorry.

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:14.810
You're leaving?

01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:18.390
I'm not the first lady anymore.

01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:21.150
I shouldn't be here.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.100
Where are you going?

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:29.030
Home.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:32.240
Where's home?

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.820
Look, can we stop with the 20 questions?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.540
Because I'm really not in the mood.

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.420
Souvenirs. Towels and stuff.

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:52.340
You're leaving too?

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:58.140
I never wanted to hurt anybody.

01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:01.390
Heck, I even thought I was helping.

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.500
You know...

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:28.710
...you make this little deal
with yourself that...

01:07:28.890 --> 01:07:31.550
...you can put up
with all the other women...

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.260
...and you can even do
without a life.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.890
You can even do without children...

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:43.260
...because you believe
in what you're doing and you think....

01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:48.480
You thought you had a chance
to help people.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.830
How are you gonna get home?

01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:59.910
Um....

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:05.090
I don't know. I hadn't really...

01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:07.250
...thought it out that far.

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:13.010
Are you sure this goes somewhere?

01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:16.010
They say LBJ used it all the time.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.840
Duane said he'd leave a car
right over there.

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:06.390
When did you, uh, first know?

01:09:06.569 --> 01:09:08.350
I mean, about me?

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.189
In the car, I think.

01:09:12.819 --> 01:09:15.939
On the way to the shelter,
you looked at my legs.

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:20.160
Bill stopped looking a long time ago.

01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:25.170
I thought maybe it was in the shower, heh.

01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:28.670
No.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.140
Oh, my God.

01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:45.680
- What?
- Police.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:53.140
- What'd you do?
- I don't know.

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:04.160
- See your driver's license, sir?
- Here, sir.

01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:06.330
And registration.

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:11.870
- Um....
- No, uh, I, uh, must've left it at home.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.380
Step out of the car, please.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:20.100
- Both of us?
- Yes, both of you, please.

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:29.020
Well, you may not be aware...

01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:32.730
...but there is a posted "No left turn" sign
just down the block here.

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.360
You went right through it.

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:35.530
Oh.

01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:39.400
- I don't know what I was thinking.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:41.490
Oh.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.700
We're look-alikes.

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.110
Heh, we don't look like each other,
but I mean--

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:50.160
I know what you think. People hire us
to impersonate the president and first lady.

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:52.670
- We work out of an agency.
- You sure look like him.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.300
Thanks. We work very hard at it.
I mean, uh, she....

01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:58.000
She got her hair cut to look--
Perfect match.

01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:01.170
We just, uh, played the Sapperstein wedding.
They loved us.

01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:04.180
We did.... We did our, uh,
Club Med routine...

01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:08.260
...where the first lady and the president
go to Club Med, and there's Bill Mitchell.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.600
He's like,
"At 0700, I want an hour of volleyball.

01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:15.890
And then at 0830, I want a complete
briefing on the whole surf situation."

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:20.240
And then the big finale
at, uh, the Talent Club.

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:22.870
<i>The sun will come out tomorrow</i>

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.370
<i>Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow</i>

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:26.620
I'm okay.

01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:31.410
<i>There'll be sun</i>
<i>Just thinkin' about tomorrow</i>

01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:34.200
<i>Clears away the cobwebs</i>
<i>And the sorrow</i>

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.840
<i>Till there's none tomorrow</i>

01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:44.470
<i>Tomorrow, I love you</i>
<i>Tomorrow, it's only a day away</i>

01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:51.150
<i>Tomorrow, tomorrow, we love you, tomorrow</i>

01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:57.310
<i>You are only a day away</i>

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:03.520
Thank you. Thanks.
We haven't worked out the final harmony.

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:05.780
- This is a full-time job?
- Uh, yeah, lately.

01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:08.370
Lately, it's been, uh, pretty much full-time.

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:11.870
Mr. and Mrs. Kovic,
I'm not gonna give you a ticket.

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:13.250
You're not?

01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:16.580
I think you ought to save
all the money you have.

01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:19.420
- Not gonna give a ticket.
- Right.

01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:21.080
- Says we should save.
- Thank you.

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:23.470
Thanks. That's very funny, heh.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.300
- Listen, you're very good.
- Right.

01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:29.220
- But she needs a lot of work.
- Yes, I know. She's kind of new at it.

01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:30.470
Now, you drive safely, huh?

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:33.470
Thank you. Thank you, officer.
Thank you very much.

01:12:33.730 --> 01:12:34.730
Okay.

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:48.160
Uh, I'm not sure I'm this hungry.

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:51.790
Wait. This is a very special sandwich.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.250
This is good.

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:01.460
What's in it?

01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:03.590
That's a secret.

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:08.840
You have a lot of secrets.

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:10.550
I guess.

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:22.270
So, what do you do the rest of the time?

01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:24.420
You mean,
when I'm not running the country?

01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:25.730
Mm-hm.

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:30.540
I run a temp agency.
You know, secretaries and stuff.

01:13:31.210 --> 01:13:33.910
- You mean, you find people jobs?
- Yes.

01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:35.420
Hmm.

01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:37.380
Is that funny?

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:40.250
It's just more than most people
do around here.

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:44.460
Don't get carried away.
I'm not that good at it.

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.210
And your family?

01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:48.720
I mean, I assume you're married.

01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:51.510
I was.

01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:52.980
Once.

01:13:54.850 --> 01:13:55.890
It didn't take.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.900
You know, Dave--

01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:08.160
It is Dave, isn't it?

01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:12.240
I can't keep all of this a secret.

01:14:13.410 --> 01:14:15.120
Yeah, I know.

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:19.790
I liked doing it though.

01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:24.340
I mean, not the fancy stuff
with all the helicopters...

01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:26.670
...and the TV cameras...

01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:30.750
...but I liked saving that shelter.

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:35.090
I liked helping people
that I hadn't even met before.

01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:40.730
Just then, I felt like I wasn't
pretending anymore.

01:14:44.150 --> 01:14:46.190
I don't think you were pretending.

01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:00.530
What would you do
if you were still in there?

01:15:03.090 --> 01:15:06.800
I mean, if you had one more chance
to be president...

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:09.330
...what would you do then?

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.310
Lots of things.

01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:43.040
Excuse me. You can't stop here.

01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:45.550
Look, there's no visitors at--

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:49.210
- H i.
- Mr. President?

01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:57.220
- I'm sorry, sir, I didn't realize that--
- Just getting a little fresh air.

01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:59.010
Certainly, sir.

01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:01.680
I was wondering, if you don't mind,
how did you get--?

01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:04.220
The president wanted some ice cream.

01:16:30.930 --> 01:16:33.960
You make a nice president, Dave Kovic.

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:35.790
Thanks.

01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.740
See you.

01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:57.070
We are delighted you're visiting
the White House.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.450
Let's keep moving, folks. We're walking.

01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:02.330
A million visitors go through
the White House every year...

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:05.240
...making it the most frequently
toured home in the country.

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.750
We're walking, we're walking
and we're stopping.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.410
Whatever changes
from one administration to the next...

01:17:10.590 --> 01:17:12.880
...the White House always maintains
its dignity.

01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:14.170
We're walking.

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:17.550
He's walking. He's Bob Alexander,
our White House chief of staff.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.930
I can't believe it!

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.510
What an honor, really, for all of you.
We're walking.

01:17:21.690 --> 01:17:25.020
Forty-two presidents and their wives
have lived in the White House.

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:34.400
I had nothing to do with this.
He called it himself. I swear to God.

01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:46.750
What do you think you're doing?

01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:49.210
You mean, the press conference?

01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:52.670
I, uh, have a couple of ideas I wanted
to share with the country.

01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:55.170
Share?

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.040
Share?

01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.550
You don't call a press conference.

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.090
I call a press conference.

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.890
You're nothing. Do you understand?

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.850
You're nobody.

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.810
I'm not nobody.

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.690
You're lint!

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:12.600
You're a flea!

01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:15.230
You're a blip!

01:18:16.410 --> 01:18:17.810
Well...

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.870
...maybe I am.

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:22.290
But you're fired.

01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:25.410
What?

01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:28.830
I said you're fired. Go on, get out of here.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.210
- Oh, I'm fired?
- Yup.

01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:32.920
You're fired.

01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:37.080
- Fine.
- Fine?

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:38.760
Fine.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.890
The whole press corps is right out there.

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:45.850
Should I go tell them?
Or did you want to?

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:52.230
Darling, they're waiting in the Press Room.
I really think you ought to get in there.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.480
Oh.

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:54.780
Bob.

01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:58.530
I'm sorry. I thought we were alone.

01:19:07.290 --> 01:19:10.710
I'd like your resignation on my desk
by the time I get back.

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.090
Don't touch anything on that desk.

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:22.220
- How are you?
- How you doing?

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:23.390
H i.

01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:26.050
- Hey, guys. What's up?
- It's the vice-president.

01:19:26.230 --> 01:19:28.140
- What could it be?
- The ex-vice-president.

01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:31.310
He'll be a prison reformer
in Denver in a year.

01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:33.980
Okay, they're coming. Let's go.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.780
Good luck.

01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:52.910
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:54.370
I, uh....

01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:00.080
I'd like to begin
with an announcement that, uh...

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:03.090
...may come as a surprise
for many of you.

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:04.380
I've, uh...

01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:08.130
...asked Bob Alexander to resign
as White House chief of staff.

01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:15.850
Over the last few months, Bob and I
have come to believe in different things.

01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:21.700
He thinks this country's fine and we
should go about doing business as usual.

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.240
I just don't feel that way.

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:28.900
Not anymore.

01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:32.330
Because, hey, things aren't fine.

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:36.120
We've got so many problems, that we don't
even want to look at them anymore.

01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:39.460
They just blend together
into this great, big noise...

01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:42.550
...and pretty soon we can't even
hear ourselves think.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:45.090
But that's not even the worst part.

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:46.970
The worst part is that we....

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:50.350
We feel we can't do anything about it.

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:53.730
And that's a tragedy...

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:55.480
...because we can.

01:20:59.030 --> 01:21:02.520
But we don't know where to start.
Maybe that's what it is.

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.030
But I have an idea...

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.160
...of where we can start.

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:12.120
From today...

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:16.710
...I'm gonna make it the responsibility
of this government...

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:19.620
...to find a job for every American
who wants one.

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:27.640
Have you ever seen the look
on somebody's face...

01:21:27.810 --> 01:21:30.470
...the day that they finally get a job?

01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:33.470
I've had some experience with this.

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:36.100
They look like they could fly.

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:40.770
And it's not about the paycheck. It's about
respect. It's about looking in the mirror...

01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:44.280
...and knowing that you've done
something valuable with your day.

01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:48.490
And if one person could start
to feel that way, and then another person...

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:53.200
...then pretty soon all these other problems
we're facing may not seem so...

01:21:53.370 --> 01:21:55.160
...impossible.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:04.750
You don't really know
how much you can do until you...

01:22:04.930 --> 01:22:07.380
...stand up and decide to try.

01:22:17.150 --> 01:22:19.560
That's it. So let's get to work. Thank you.

01:22:19.730 --> 01:22:21.100
Mr. President.

01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:24.400
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:27.910
In the boldest initiative yet
of the new Bill Mitchell administration...

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:31.790
...the president has proposed a
comprehensive full employment program...

01:22:31.950 --> 01:22:34.870
...unparalleled since the days of FDR.

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:38.880
The proposal brought swift reaction,
here on Capitol Hill.

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:43.960
President Mitchell's right. Putting people
to work is what we ought to be doing.

01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:46.670
Better to have a job
than collecting a welfare check.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:51.090
We're here trying to carry the water for him.
I've carried water.

01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:54.050
And then now to say this.
This guy's out to lunch.

01:22:54.230 --> 01:22:56.470
He's, you know.... Somebody's--

01:22:56.650 --> 01:22:58.810
The lights are on, but nobody's home.

01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:03.190
I love it. It's great.
All we've gotta do is cut <i>Star Wars.</i>

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:07.270
I want to look at Mitchell's proposal.

01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:11.280
Like the program I presented
when I ran for president.

01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:14.820
Has the president taken leave
of his faculties? I ask you, Eleanor Clift.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.110
This is the definition
of modern leadership.

01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:20.450
Set out a bold goal and you don't say
how you're going to get there.

01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:22.960
They tried this in Russia
and wrecked the country.

01:23:23.130 --> 01:23:25.040
I wonder if the Communists got him.

01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.580
If you look at a photograph
of Bill Mitchell...

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:30.170
...taken before the stroke
and one right after...

01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:32.630
- What?
- ...you will see distinct differences.

01:23:32.810 --> 01:23:34.720
Are you saying this is a conspiracy?

01:23:34.890 --> 01:23:37.260
<i>Yes, I am saying this is a conspiracy.</i>

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.270
<i>Do you think you're a little paranoid?</i>

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:41.980
<i>No. Have you compared the photographs,</i>
<i>Larry?</i>

01:24:05.210 --> 01:24:08.170
Pfft, this is crazy.

01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:14.350
The <i>U.S.News</i> hammered us,
but they're always tough on that.

01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:16.800
- Rosenthal loved us in <i>The Times.</i>
- Oh, that's good.

01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:19.470
Mr. President,
Mr. Nance is waiting for you inside.

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:21.350
- Ah. Who?
- The vice-president.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.600
- The vice-president.
- Oh, the--

01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:28.810
Nance. I thought--

01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:31.860
Uh, get my, uh, I want my ears checked.
Would you do that?

01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:35.070
Sorry, I didn't understand.
Ever since the stroke I get a little--

01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:38.620
Oh, my God.

01:25:00.190 --> 01:25:02.050
Mr. President...

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.720
- ...these are a gift from the King of Togo.
- Oh.

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:07.810
- Fertility beads.
- Ah.

01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:11.150
These are from the people of Burundi.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.320
Oh.

01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:14.650
Thank you.

01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:16.990
They know hats in Burundi. Look at this.

01:25:20.370 --> 01:25:22.740
Mr. President,
may I speak frankly with you?

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.700
Yes, please. Sit down.
It's good to see you.

01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:33.220
I know we haven't always gotten along.
I know we've disagreed politically.

01:25:33.390 --> 01:25:37.100
And I suppose I know
what you think of me personally.

01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:41.890
But I've always tried to respect
the role you wanted me to play.

01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:46.680
When I've disagreed with this
administration, I've kept it to myself.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.020
When you wanted my support,
you always had it.

01:25:51.190 --> 01:25:52.190
Yes.

01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:54.150
Damn it, Bill.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.070
How could you do something like this
to me?

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.240
- Do what?
- Come on, we're not children.

01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:06.030
I didn't have anything to do with this
First Liberty nonsense and you know it.

01:26:07.210 --> 01:26:10.950
- First Liberty.
- All I've got is my integrity, Bill.

01:26:11.130 --> 01:26:12.130
Okay?

01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:15.170
That's all I have left.

01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:18.130
Now, I don't know why you've turned
your attack dogs on me.

01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:20.920
- They're not my attack dogs.
- What?

01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:23.470
I'll take care of this.

01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:26.270
- We made it up.
- What do you mean, you made it up?

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.230
Well, we had to, Dave.
The guy's a Boy Scout.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.270
But, Alan, this is wrong.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:32.640
Wrong?

01:26:33.190 --> 01:26:36.860
Oh, I know. It looks awfully bad
and I'm really embarrassed...

01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:38.190
...but it was Bob's idea.

01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:50.130
Have you spoken to the president?

01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:03.260
When I first began to look into the
allegations...

01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:06.520
...concerning First Liberty Savings
and Loan...

01:27:06.690 --> 01:27:10.810
...I thought the wrongdoing
was restricted to the vice-president's office.

01:27:11.730 --> 01:27:14.070
I think you better take a look at this.

01:27:16.150 --> 01:27:20.950
<i>But as I began to investigate,</i>
<i>I realized that this pattern of corruption...</i>

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.360
<i>...extended much higher.</i>

01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:28.160
<i>I was saddened to discover at least 15</i>
<i>separate acts of intervention...</i>

01:27:28.330 --> 01:27:30.750
<i>...by this administration...</i>

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:35.290
<i>...most with the full knowledge</i>
<i>of the president, and all of them illegal.</i>

01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:39.330
- Jesus Christ.
<i>- Federal regulators were influenced...</i>

01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:41.470
<i>...records were destroyed...</i>

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.430
<i>...and pressure was brought to bear...</i>

01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:46.380
<i>...in some cases...</i>

01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:49.930
<i>...by President Mitchell himself.</i>

01:27:50.110 --> 01:27:52.940
- Now he's making stuff up about me.
- He's not.

01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:57.650
He's not?

01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:01.030
You mean, I did all that?

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.780
You didn't. Bill Mitchell did.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.210
This is a mistake.
We shouldn't be doing this right now.

01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:17.870
I can't go into hiding.

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.300
What are you hiding?

01:28:27.890 --> 01:28:30.850
Mr. President,
what did you know and when did you know it?

01:28:33.690 --> 01:28:36.060
When will you have a confession?

01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:38.650
Will you answer these allegations?

01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:40.650
When will you make a statement?

01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:42.910
Is this job stuff just a smoke screen?

01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:46.070
Mr. President, did you commit the crime?

01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:51.370
Mr. President, I don't know any other way
to put it. This dog just won't hunt.

01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:55.250
We may be able to hold off on this
First Liberty thing for a little while...

01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:58.040
...but if you've been running around
with this new jobs--

01:28:58.210 --> 01:29:00.300
Just put us on a spit
and bring in the sauce.

01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:03.080
- If you could just wait for a couple months.
- Yeah, wait.

01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:04.970
- Yeah.
- No.

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:07.100
No, I don't want to wait a while.
We can't.

01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:09.850
Mr. President,
I understand how you feel...

01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:12.810
...but we're talking about obstructing
federal regulators...

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.940
...violating election laws.

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:18.440
I got people up on the Hill
talking impeachment.

01:29:18.610 --> 01:29:21.020
What is with President Mitchell lately,
huh?

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.690
I know the president's supposed to serve
four years, but now it may be 15 to 20.

01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:31.870
But we make fun of the president. We
knock the president. But it's a tough job.

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:36.500
<i>Take today. The president woke up,</i>
<i>broke the law, got caught, he pardoned himself.</i>

01:29:36.670 --> 01:29:38.040
<i>That is a full day.</i>

01:29:40.170 --> 01:29:43.630
<i>- Oh, and now political action groups--</i>
- Mr. President.

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.420
- May I come in?
- Oh, heh.

01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:50.800
A dirty business we're in, sometimes.

01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:51.980
Yeah.

01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.060
Mr. President...

01:29:57.230 --> 01:30:01.440
...whatever happens, I just wanted you
to know that I think your jobs program is...

01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:03.020
...a wonderful idea.

01:30:06.490 --> 01:30:07.650
Thanks.

01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:10.110
Not many people are gonna
pay much attention now, but....

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:13.490
Thanks.

01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:21.340
Uh, uh....

01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:23.840
Would you like to...

01:30:24.010 --> 01:30:26.220
...sit down for a minute?

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:28.800
Sure.

01:30:38.190 --> 01:30:39.310
Do you ever, uh....

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:40.480
Ahem.

01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:43.230
...think back to how you got started?

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:47.480
Um, heh....

01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:49.650
I was a shoe salesman.

01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:52.860
But not very happy about it.

01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:57.200
One day, my wife says to me:

01:30:57.380 --> 01:31:00.120
"Why don't you try running for office?

01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:02.830
You know? You talk about it all the time.

01:31:03.010 --> 01:31:04.500
Why don't you just go do it?"

01:31:04.670 --> 01:31:06.760
So I tell my boss...

01:31:06.930 --> 01:31:09.510
...I have a dentist appointment...

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:13.300
...and I go down
to the Registrar of Voters...

01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:15.260
...on my lunch break.

01:31:16.690 --> 01:31:18.890
Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.

01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:22.270
- Really?
- My wife was my campaign manager.

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:28.060
We had a budget of $2000
with advertising.

01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:35.700
How about you?

01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:38.780
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:42.000
How did you get started?

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.790
Kind of the same way.

01:31:59.230 --> 01:32:01.350
Vice-president's a good man, isn't he?

01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:07.740
Yes.

01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:12.110
He's a very good man.

01:32:19.290 --> 01:32:20.830
I don't want to lose you.

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:42.470
The president has requested this rare,
joint session of Congress...

01:32:42.650 --> 01:32:46.940
...so he can personally answer
the allegations raised by Bob Alexander...

01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:48.440
...his former chief of staff.

01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:51.950
<i>Frankly, it's hard to recall</i>
<i>the last time both houses of Congress...</i>

01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:55.450
<i>...convened without so much of an idea</i>
<i>of what the president plans to say.</i>

01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:58.360
<i>So one would speculate</i>
<i>that it's about the charges...</i>

01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:00.580
<i>...against the vice-president</i>
<i>and president..</i>

01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:04.870
<i>Those rumors have been circulating</i>
<i>on Capitol Hill now for several weeks.</i>

01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:08.630
It's time to go. Better get inside.

01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.510
- It's all set with Duane?
- All set.

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:11.710
Everything's here.

01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:13.300
Okay, let's go.

01:33:16.810 --> 01:33:18.010
Relax.

01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:20.260
Right.

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:23.300
- Enjoy the moment.
- Right.

01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:29.820
- Hello, Ben.
- Big day, Bob.

01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:32.350
- Thanks for coming. Come on in.
- I wouldn't miss it.

01:33:32.530 --> 01:33:34.740
- You know the Claghorns?
- Of course. Of course.

01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:36.440
Hey, Bob, what do you think?

01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:39.160
Put that away.
Let's wait till the speech first.

01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:46.310
The House will be in order.

01:33:50.670 --> 01:33:54.260
Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States.

01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:31.040
Thank you. Thank you.

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:32.880
Shh, shh, shh....

01:34:33.050 --> 01:34:34.540
Here it comes.

01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:39.170
<i>Mr. Speaker.</i>

01:34:39.810 --> 01:34:41.550
<i>Vice-President.</i>

01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:44.020
<i>Members of the Congress.</i>

01:34:44.850 --> 01:34:46.640
<i>Fellow Americans.</i>

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:52.560
I wish I could be here today
under different circumstances.

01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:57.950
There are a lot of things about this country
that we should be discussing.

01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:00.700
But I realize that's not possible now.

01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:06.240
As all of you know, my former chief of staff
has implicated me in a scandal...

01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:09.910
...involving
the First Liberty Savings and Loan.

01:35:10.090 --> 01:35:14.630
Once people start talking about a scandal,
it's hard to talk about anything else.

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.880
So fine, let's talk about it.

01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:20.880
Bob Alexander has accused me of....

01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:24.600
Let me read this to make sure I get it right.

01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:27.470
"Illegally influencing
government regulators...

01:35:27.650 --> 01:35:30.510
...on behalf
of major campaign contributors...

01:35:30.690 --> 01:35:33.730
...interfering with an ongoing
Justice Department investigation...

01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:38.270
...and violating federal election laws
in the area of campaign finance."

01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:40.530
Okay, let's get right to the guts of it.

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:43.320
Each one of these charges
is absolutely true.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.080
Die, you pond scum.

01:35:48.250 --> 01:35:51.790
I'm the president, and as they say,
the buck stops here.

01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:57.300
So I take full responsibility
for every one of my illegal actions.

01:35:58.590 --> 01:36:01.050
But, you see, that's not the whole story.

01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:06.260
And I think each one of you
is entitled to the whole truth.

01:36:07.190 --> 01:36:09.550
I have here written proof...

01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:16.770
...in the form of notes,
memoranda and personal directives...

01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:21.280
...proving that Bob Alexander
was also involved...

01:36:21.450 --> 01:36:25.320
...in each one of these incidents,
and in most cases, planned them as well.

01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:28.750
Alan.

01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:35.420
Now, allegations of wrongdoing have also
been made against Vice-President Nance.

01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:38.210
Now, as this evidence will prove,
at no time...

01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:41.550
...and in no way was the vice-president
involved in any of this.

01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:43.460
<i>Bob just made all that up.</i>

01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:48.170
Vice-President Nance...

01:36:48.850 --> 01:36:52.090
...is a good and decent public servant...

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:57.060
...and I'd like to apologize for any pain
this may have caused him or his family.

01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:14.330
And while we're on the subject...

01:37:15.130 --> 01:37:19.000
...I'd like to apologize
to the American people.

01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.010
You see...

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:25.420
...I forgot that I was hired
to do a job for you...

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:28.430
...and it was just a temp job at that.

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.560
I forgot that I had 250 million people...

01:37:30.730 --> 01:37:34.600
...who were paying me
to make their lives a little bit better.

01:37:34.770 --> 01:37:37.010
<i>And I didn't live up</i>
<i>to my part of the bargain.</i>

01:37:38.150 --> 01:37:39.480
<i>See....</i>

01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:43.320
I think there are certain things
you should expect from your president.

01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:48.240
I had to care more about you
than I do about me.

01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:51.240
I had to care more about....

01:37:52.330 --> 01:37:56.580
I had to care more about what's right
than I do about what's popular. Uh....

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.500
I ought to be willing to give up
this whole thing...

01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:05.210
...for something I believe in...

01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:08.840
...because if I'm not....

01:38:11.930 --> 01:38:13.890
If I'm not--

01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:21.690
If I'm not--

01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:25.570
If I'm not, then...

01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:28.570
...maybe I don't belong here in the first--

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.530
Get a doctor! Move it!

01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:39.460
Clear the aisle. Clear the aisle.

01:38:40.130 --> 01:38:42.170
<i>Calm yourselves.</i>

01:39:42.190 --> 01:39:43.480
Let's get him out of there.

01:39:43.650 --> 01:39:45.270
Quickly. Quickly.

01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:54.370
- Mitchell's that way.
- Stay back.

01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:18.980
Well?

01:40:20.230 --> 01:40:21.230
Well?

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.350
You okay getting home?

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:30.360
Yeah, it's not far.

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.820
Take care.

01:40:35.410 --> 01:40:36.410
Dave.

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.580
I would've taken a bullet for you.

01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:54.920
Thanks, Duane.

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.710
<i>The stroke hit at 8:42 p.m...</i>

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:12.960
<i>...just as the president was concluding</i>
<i>his remarks to a joint session of Congress.</i>

01:42:13.130 --> 01:42:15.050
<i>Spokesmen of the First Naval Hospital...</i>

01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:18.090
<i>...have confirmed</i>
<i>it was a massive edema.</i>

01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:21.760
<i>And unlike his previous stroke,</i>
<i>it has left the president fully incapacitated.</i>

01:42:21.930 --> 01:42:24.930
<i>The nation mourned</i>
<i>as President William Harrison Mitchell...</i>

01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:28.940
<i>...was laid to rest at Arlington National</i>
<i>Cemetery early this morning.</i>

01:42:29.110 --> 01:42:31.520
<i>After lingering in a coma</i>
<i>for almost five months...</i>

01:42:31.690 --> 01:42:34.530
<i>...the president succumbed Thursday</i>
<i>at 4:20 p.m.</i>

01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:38.190
<i>In a bittersweet ceremony in</i>
<i>the capital, Vice-President Gary Nance...</i>

01:42:38.370 --> 01:42:43.080
<i>...was officially sworn in today</i>
<i>as the 45th president of the United States.</i>

01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:47.740
<i>Under the terms of the 25th Amendment,</i>
<i>Nance has been acting with full authority...</i>

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:50.880
<i>...since Bill Mitchell's incapacitation.</i>

01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:53.500
<i>The new president promises</i>
<i>a leadership of fairness.</i>

01:42:53.670 --> 01:42:56.920
<i>I plan to continue</i>
<i>Bill Mitchell's call to arms.</i>

01:42:57.090 --> 01:43:00.340
<i>This isn't my presidency,</i>
<i>this is his presidency.</i>

01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:04.130
<i>And I can't think of a better way</i>
<i>to ensure his legacy...</i>

01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:07.100
<i>...than to continue the principles</i>
<i>he initiated.</i>

01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:10.730
<i>Bob Alexander and eight</i>
<i>other members of the Mitchell administration...</i>

01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:14.020
<i>...were indicted on 34 counts</i>
<i>of election law violations...</i>

01:43:14.190 --> 01:43:15.780
<i>...and obstruction of justice.</i>

01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:19.030
<i>Ironically, the indictments came</i>
<i>just 48 hours after final passage...</i>

01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:21.070
<i>...of the Bill Mitchell Jobs Bill...</i>

01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:23.910
<i>...for a comprehensive</i>
<i>employment program.</i>

01:43:25.410 --> 01:43:29.080
We have a limited amount of buttons,
so don't put any buttons in the envelopes.

01:43:29.250 --> 01:43:30.450
Honey.

01:43:32.050 --> 01:43:34.080
Dave Kobic. Time for a change.

01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:36.500
- No, no. Kovic. Kovic.
- Kovic.

01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:38.790
Tom. Tom.
We have a limited amount of posters.

01:43:38.970 --> 01:43:41.380
Just put them in the really busy places.

01:43:41.930 --> 01:43:43.590
She's terrific. She can do anything.

01:43:43.770 --> 01:43:47.310
- Just the flyers.
- Okay, well, she's changed.

01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:51.520
It's the middle of winter. They're gonna
turn off her heat. She needs a job.

01:43:55.650 --> 01:44:00.400
Open. Like this. Like this. Neat. Neat.

01:44:00.570 --> 01:44:02.780
- Hi.
- No buttons.

01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:05.240
Would you like to volunteer?

01:44:05.410 --> 01:44:07.570
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, you're a good man.

01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:11.240
Uh, did you get the fund-raising thing
I sent you? Yeah, City Council.

01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:14.660
- We have flyers here.
- Thanks. All right.

01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:16.800
We're on a roll now. Karen, you got a job.

01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:18.250
- Thank you.
- It's Monday.

01:44:18.430 --> 01:44:22.170
And everybody works on Monday.

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:36.190
- Hi.
- Hi, heh.

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:39.190
I understand you find people jobs?

01:44:39.570 --> 01:44:40.830
- Well....
- This is great, heh.

01:44:40.930 --> 01:44:44.400
Yeah, I'm, uh, running-- You look great.

01:44:46.770 --> 01:44:50.240
I saw you on TV at the funeral and....

01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:51.660
Well....

01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:53.790
That's finally over.

01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:01.630
Uh....

01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:04.800
Uh, why don't we go into my office?

01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:07.220
Excuse us.
