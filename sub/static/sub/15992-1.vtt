00:54.087 --> 00:59.218
<i>1936, Jesse Owens.
1960, Cassius Clay.</i>

00:59.292 --> 01:02.261
<i>And now in 1988,
the name on everyone's lips,</i>

01:02.328 --> 01:05.695
<i>US table tennis champion,
Randy Daytona.</i>

01:05.765 --> 01:09.861
<i>You've seen him
in Sports Illustrated, on
the Cinnamon Toast Crunch box.</i>

01:09.936 --> 01:13.667
<i>You may even already own
his McDonald's
collector's glass.</i>

01:13.740 --> 01:17.073
<i>The golden boy
who iced Iceland in round one,</i>

01:17.143 --> 01:20.306
<i>and checked off Czechoslovakia
in round two.</i>

01:21.214 --> 01:24.980
<i>So why don't
we take a moment to meet
the real Randy Daytona?</i>

01:25.685 --> 01:28.916
<i>Here he is showing us
his skills with
his lucky Def Leppard paddle</i>

01:28.988 --> 01:31.115
<i>that's won him
over 200 amateur matches.</i>

01:31.191 --> 01:36.026
<i>With him, as always, his coach
and father, Sergeant Pete
Daytona, of the US Marines.</i>

01:36.496 --> 01:39.260
<i>Randy,
you're only 12 years old,
and already they're saying</i>

01:39.332 --> 01:40.731
<i>that your name
will go down among those</i>

01:40.800 --> 01:44.531
<i>of the greatest
Ping-Pong players
ever to take up the sport.</i>

01:44.604 --> 01:47.198
<i>And right offhand,
I don't know
what those names are.</i>

01:47.273 --> 01:51.903
<i>Randy,
the eyes of all America,
and indeed the entire world,</i>

01:51.978 --> 01:53.445
<i>will be on you tonight.</i>

01:53.513 --> 01:55.481
USA! USA! USA!

01:55.548 --> 01:57.778
<i>2:45 am. The moment
you've all been waiting for.</i>

01:57.851 --> 02:00.012
<i>The men's table tennis
semifinals.</i>

02:00.086 --> 02:02.782
<i>Tiny balls, bouncing for gold.</i>

02:02.856 --> 02:04.380
USA! USA! USA!

02:04.457 --> 02:08.553
<i>Now, presenting
the United States of America,</i>

02:08.627 --> 02:10.390
<i>Randy Daytona!</i>

02:10.463 --> 02:11.589
<i>Here he is,</i>

02:11.664 --> 02:14.827
<i>entering to his unofficial
theme song, Rock of Ages,</i>

02:14.901 --> 02:17.096
<i>by the super group
Def Leppard.</i>

02:17.170 --> 02:19.468
I love you, Randy!

02:22.442 --> 02:24.774
<i>Hey, big guy,
I just want to make sure
you're ready.</i>

02:24.844 --> 02:25.868
Have you seen my dad?

02:25.945 --> 02:26.934
No.

02:30.783 --> 02:31.772
Where were you?

02:31.851 --> 02:33.842
<i>You think I'd miss this?</i>

02:39.559 --> 02:42.494
<i>You didn't put money on this,
did you?</i>

02:42.562 --> 02:44.291
Dad, you promised.

02:44.364 --> 02:45.854
Try not to think about it,
okay?

02:45.932 --> 02:48.457
<i>Now, presenting East Germany,</i>

02:48.535 --> 02:51.163
<i>Karl Wolfschtagg!</i>

02:55.508 --> 02:59.171
Deutschland! Deutschland!
Deutschland! Deutschland!

03:14.694 --> 03:16.753
May the best man win, huh?

03:19.399 --> 03:21.765
I will destroy him!

03:21.834 --> 03:23.597
Beat that Kraut!

03:40.653 --> 03:43.986
<i>Breathtaking intensity
surrounds the table</i>

03:44.057 --> 03:47.515
<i>as Daytona and Manslaughter
fire away at each other.</i>

03:49.896 --> 03:51.864
<i>Daytona's in the groove.</i>

03:54.534 --> 03:57.833
<i>Both men distancing themselves
from the table now.</i>

03:57.904 --> 04:00.930
<i>There's a high elevation lob.
Tremendous accuracy.</i>

04:01.007 --> 04:04.773
<i>And a smash by Manslaughter.
And Randy Daytona
makes the save.</i>

04:11.985 --> 04:14.783
<i>One more smash!
And now Daytona goes back.</i>

04:16.956 --> 04:18.548
<i>Farther back!</i>

04:19.358 --> 04:20.519
<i>Back!</i>

04:21.894 --> 04:25.330
<i>And the crowd rises
in anticipation!</i>

04:25.398 --> 04:26.695
<i>He stretches.</i>

04:26.766 --> 04:27.994
Look out!

04:28.968 --> 04:29.957
<i>Shit!</i>

04:33.606 --> 04:36.302
Randy? Randy? You okay?

04:36.376 --> 04:38.310
Randy? Randy?

04:38.845 --> 04:42.076
<i>Randy Daytona,
unable to finish.</i>

04:42.148 --> 04:45.311
<i>Match forfeit to East Germany.</i>

04:52.125 --> 04:53.285
Randy?

04:54.894 --> 04:56.862
<i>I'm going to Disneyland!</i>

05:08.007 --> 05:10.874
<i>Come on, guys.
Can't we talk about this?</i>

05:10.943 --> 05:13.309
Mr. Feng does not
extend credit.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.614
Gentlemen, time is money.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.017
Chop-chop.

05:22.655 --> 05:23.815
Jesus!

05:25.758 --> 05:28.192
<i>Well, that's the way the
cookie crumbles here in Korea.</i>

05:28.261 --> 05:31.128
<i>As Reno's golden boy
was humiliated
in the semifinals,</i>

05:31.197 --> 05:35.156
<i>and if he lives to be 100,
he'll never live down
that Disneyland line.</i>

05:35.234 --> 05:38.362
<i>If he returns to America,
a life of shame.</i>

05:42.809 --> 05:45.369
<i>Two tickets to paradise!</i>

05:45.445 --> 05:49.211
<i>Won't you pack your bags?
We'll leave tonight</i>

05:49.716 --> 05:53.413
<i>I got...
Two tickets to paradise!</i>

05:54.187 --> 06:00.387
<i>I got...
Two tickets to paradise!</i>

06:00.460 --> 06:01.825
<i>Let's go to heaven</i>

06:06.833 --> 06:08.767
<i>Yeah! Thank you!</i>

06:08.835 --> 06:10.632
<i>Take a bow, honey.</i>

06:10.703 --> 06:12.136
<i>There she is!</i>

06:12.205 --> 06:15.231
<i>All right,
let's keep the love going
for our very next act,</i>

06:15.308 --> 06:19.074
<i>The Peppermill's
very own Ping-Pong wizard...</i>

06:19.145 --> 06:21.443
<i>Randy Daytona!
Randy Daytona!</i>

06:21.514 --> 06:24.244
<i>Come on, let's bring him out.</i>

06:28.788 --> 06:31.484
<i>How's everybody feeling
this afternoon?</i>

06:36.996 --> 06:39.191
All right!

06:58.985 --> 07:00.782
<i>I don't want to work.</i>

07:01.120 --> 07:04.681
I just want to bang
on these drums
all day long. Am I right?

07:13.266 --> 07:14.494
Hey!

07:16.936 --> 07:18.301
Thank you!

07:22.942 --> 07:25.433
Hey, a volunteer!
How you doing, buddy?

07:25.511 --> 07:28.241
<i>I was just going
for more Cheese 'n Mac.</i>

07:31.784 --> 07:32.910
Stop!

07:35.922 --> 07:37.253
Thank you!

07:41.961 --> 07:44.555
<i>We're in the biz</i>

07:44.630 --> 07:49.260
to bring the bewonderment
of live theater
to these people,

07:49.335 --> 07:53.795
so they will stay
for the loosest slots
on The Strip.

07:53.873 --> 07:57.832
Not to give them
a heart attack, Randy!

07:57.910 --> 08:00.845
Sorry, Rick.
It will never happen again.

08:00.913 --> 08:03.541
<i>I know because you're fired.</i>

08:04.450 --> 08:07.476
Get your stink out
of my theater.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.550
Sorry, Randy.

08:13.626 --> 08:16.459
But some agent
was looking for you backstage.

08:16.529 --> 08:18.520
Maybe he missed the show.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.436
Thank you, Bethany.

08:24.770 --> 08:26.397
<i>My name's Sarah.</i>

08:27.073 --> 08:28.836
Are you kidding me?
Uh-uh.

08:29.475 --> 08:33.206
<i>You've called me Bethany
for the past five years.
It's fine.</i>

08:35.815 --> 08:37.611
Mr. Daytona?
Yeah.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.548
Ernie Rodriguez, FBI.

08:39.619 --> 08:42.486
<i>Oh, God! I didn't mean
to hurt that guy!</i>

08:42.554 --> 08:44.147
How could I know that
he had a bad heart?

08:44.222 --> 08:45.781
<i>That's not why I'm here.</i>

08:45.858 --> 08:49.294
Hey, actually, I thought
that was part of the show.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.695
Till the paramedics showed up,
I was laughing my ass off.

08:52.765 --> 08:53.789
<i>Well, am I in
some kind of trouble or...</i>

08:53.866 --> 08:54.890
No.

08:54.967 --> 08:56.366
I came to ask you
for your help.

08:56.435 --> 08:59.768
The FBI needs you to take part
in a top-secret mission.

08:59.839 --> 09:02.239
One that calls for a man
of your unique skills.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.115
<i>I'm not joking, man.
I'm FBI. I swear.</i>

09:11.183 --> 09:13.845
Come on, man.
You got a hidden camera
on you, right?

09:13.920 --> 09:17.219
<i>Cut it out.
You're not allowed to do that.</i>

09:17.290 --> 09:18.314
Fake gun and everything.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.256
<i>Now why don't you put on
some big boy pants</i>

09:26.332 --> 09:28.027
<i>and we'll go for a ride.</i>

09:32.038 --> 09:33.869
The man with the umbrella
is our target.

09:33.940 --> 09:36.340
<i>I think you'll want
to help us catch him, Randy.</i>

09:36.409 --> 09:37.876
His name is Mr. Feng.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.571
Mr. Feng?

09:40.746 --> 09:42.111
<i>That's the guy
that killed my father.</i>

09:42.181 --> 09:43.876
I know.

09:43.950 --> 09:46.043
His face
has never been photographed.

09:46.118 --> 09:49.986
This sketch is based
on the description
by a late agent of the ATF.

09:50.056 --> 09:52.024
<i>Wait a minute,
this guy looks like...</i>

09:52.091 --> 09:55.822
<i>George Takei? Mr. Sulu?
I know. It's not, though.
We checked him out.</i>

09:55.895 --> 09:58.090
<i>We have reason to believe
he's about to make</i>

09:58.164 --> 10:00.496
some kind of a major shipment
into the US.

10:00.566 --> 10:03.535
And what, man?
What do you want me
to do about it?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.036
What you were born to do.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.572
You see, Randy,
Feng is a Ping-Pong fanatic.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.904
He played for the Chinese
when he was a kid.

10:09.976 --> 10:12.274
Now every five years
he brings the best to him.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.711
A high-stakes tournament,
at a secret location.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.179
Invitation only.

10:16.248 --> 10:18.216
His men go to tournaments
all over the world,

10:18.284 --> 10:20.377
searching for
the best of the best.

10:20.453 --> 10:24.048
<i>You see that gold paddle?
That's the invitation.</i>

10:24.123 --> 10:27.388
<i>You, Randy,
you're our ticket in.</i>

10:27.460 --> 10:29.189
<i>I'm not a spy, man.</i>

10:29.295 --> 10:31.286
<i>Look, you don't have
to do anything
but play Ping-Pong, man.</i>

10:31.364 --> 10:33.059
You go to a few tournaments
and do your stuff.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.360
<i>If you're as good
as you used to be,</i>

10:34.433 --> 10:36.264
<i>I'm sure
you'll get an invitation.</i>

10:36.335 --> 10:38.428
<i>Look, this year Feng's
invited a who's who</i>

10:38.504 --> 10:40.335
of the international
most wanted list.

10:40.406 --> 10:42.169
<i>Randy, something big's
going down.</i>

10:42.241 --> 10:45.176
<i>Here's the thing.
You're bananas.</i>

10:45.244 --> 10:49.203
I do matinee shows.
I get introduced
by a cockatoo.

10:49.281 --> 10:51.613
<i>Mr. Daytona,
you're the only one
who can lead us to Feng.</i>

10:51.684 --> 10:52.810
<i>I've been authorized
to offer you</i>

10:52.885 --> 10:55.319
<i>anything in the government's
power if you help us out.</i>

10:55.388 --> 10:59.290
<i>You don't get it, do you, man?
I don't compete anymore!</i>

10:59.358 --> 11:00.689
Okay?

11:00.760 --> 11:02.785
Maybe I never should have.

11:16.909 --> 11:18.137
Caucasians.

11:18.878 --> 11:22.644
<i>Hey, Dad. I'm sorry
I haven't been around
in awhile.</i>

11:24.350 --> 11:28.514
<i>And again, I'm sorry about
abbreviating your dates
on the headstone.</i>

11:29.689 --> 11:34.388
<i>The numbers were, like,
100 bucks a pop, and
apostrophes were free so...</i>

11:47.106 --> 11:48.573
Excuse me?

11:48.641 --> 11:50.131
Excuse me!

11:50.743 --> 11:53.007
<i>The new slide's
a little close, isn't it?</i>

11:53.079 --> 11:57.209
What are you gonna do?
They sold the air rights
to the cemetery.

11:57.283 --> 11:59.774
They sold the air rights
to a cemetery?

11:59.852 --> 12:03.379
<i>It's a pretty okay
water slide, though.
It's called Eerie Canals.</i>

12:03.456 --> 12:08.450
<i>I guess it's a theme
that it's haunted. Something.</i>

12:08.527 --> 12:09.824
Look out!

12:15.868 --> 12:17.665
<i>All right. I'm in.</i>

12:57.543 --> 12:58.908
I love that smell.

12:58.978 --> 13:01.071
Good to be back
on the circuit again, huh?

13:03.215 --> 13:05.376
I meant pancakes.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.510
I love the smell of pancakes.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.780
<i>Okay, you're not here
to have fun.</i>

13:08.854 --> 13:10.845
<i>All right? You're here to win.
Get your head in the game.</i>

13:10.923 --> 13:12.550
What, do you think Feng
is gonna have scouts here?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.718
No, but you got to win here
to get to State.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.853
You are gonna win, right?

13:16.929 --> 13:19.056
I can take these punks.

13:19.131 --> 13:22.066
<i>All right, first up
we have Andy...</i>

13:23.502 --> 13:25.993
<i>Randy Daytona</i>

13:26.105 --> 13:30.838
<i>versus our four-time
Western Conference Champion,</i>

13:30.910 --> 13:32.844
<i>The Hammer.</i>

13:59.538 --> 14:01.005
<i>I don't know what the hell
he's talking about.</i>

14:01.073 --> 14:03.405
<i>I'm still trying to figure out
if it's a dude or a chick.</i>

14:16.889 --> 14:18.516
No mercy, Randy.

14:41.247 --> 14:43.875
Have your grandma
pull the car around.

14:57.496 --> 15:00.795
Can you dig it?

15:09.008 --> 15:10.942
Tastes good.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.479
11 to 3!

15:17.783 --> 15:20.251
<i>I told you I was rusty.
I haven't competed
in 19 years.</i>

15:20.319 --> 15:22.412
<i>Why don't you cut me
some slack, man?</i>

15:22.488 --> 15:23.978
I need some time to warm up.

15:24.056 --> 15:27.389
<i>Time we don't have.
Feng's tournament's
in two weeks.</i>

15:27.459 --> 15:29.757
Man, I got to get you
in shape.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.232
<i>We're here.</i>

15:36.869 --> 15:40.600
<i>The world's greatest
Ping-Pong instructor
owns a takeout restaurant?</i>

15:40.673 --> 15:43.073
<i>Don't hate.
The school's upstairs.</i>

15:46.078 --> 15:49.047
<i>This guy's blind,
so let me do the talking.</i>

15:49.114 --> 15:51.344
<i>Wong won't train just anybody.</i>

15:51.984 --> 15:53.849
<i>And he never trains gweilo.</i>

15:53.919 --> 15:55.614
<i>Who?
Gweilo.</i>

15:55.688 --> 15:58.748
<i>It means "round eye."
Gringo. You, man.</i>

15:58.824 --> 16:00.917
He only takes
Chinese students.

16:04.263 --> 16:05.594
Damn, bro.

16:06.332 --> 16:07.492
<i>Hey...</i>

16:13.772 --> 16:14.898
You okay, dude?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.236
Get out!

16:16.308 --> 16:18.503
<i>Get out.
I don't teach gweilo.</i>

16:19.745 --> 16:22.213
<i>How did you know that
we were gweilo?</i>

16:22.281 --> 16:26.877
Same way that I can tell
you are 30 years old.

16:26.952 --> 16:28.613
Too old to start training.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.213
Pudgy.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.588
You are filled
with self-doubt.

16:35.594 --> 16:37.789
And you use Lady Speed Stick.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.457
It was on sale.

16:47.439 --> 16:49.669
Feng was my most gifted pupil.

16:51.076 --> 16:54.512
He played table tennis
like the devil
in short shorts.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.372
But he had expensive taste.

16:58.717 --> 17:00.685
He began to steal and extort.

17:00.753 --> 17:04.450
Turning my school
of table tennis
into a den of thieves.

17:05.758 --> 17:09.022
And when I cast him out,
he joined the Triad.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.425
He lured my brother Le Ping
in with him.

17:11.497 --> 17:14.660
And when Le Ping tried
to go straight, he killed him.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.531
<i>Le Ping's daughter
was left fatherless.</i>

17:17.603 --> 17:20.333
<i>If you help Randy and me
get to Feng's, we'll nail him.</i>

17:20.406 --> 17:21.873
I give you my word.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.809
I will help you,
secret agent man.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.575
You will start training
tomorrow, Randy.

17:29.648 --> 17:33.175
Bring only your strength,
your honor
and a check for $300.

17:33.252 --> 17:35.345
Hey, secret agent man.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.821
I tell you something
right now, the truth.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.951
Your boy will not pull it off.
We need a natural.

17:42.027 --> 17:44.860
Something I can work with.
You know what I mean.

17:52.704 --> 17:54.433
Dude!
What?

17:54.506 --> 17:55.996
What did I miss?

18:00.679 --> 18:05.343
<i>Well, if it isn't
the infamous Randy Daytona.</i>

18:05.417 --> 18:09.114
How was Disneyland?
Did you meet Dumbo?

18:09.188 --> 18:11.520
Is it always this crowded?

18:11.590 --> 18:13.751
<i>Only when I'm not teaching.</i>

18:17.129 --> 18:20.155
<i>That's my niece,
Maggie Wong Mei Fei.</i>

18:22.034 --> 18:24.969
She brings her father,
Le Ping, great honor.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.809
<i>Wong's Mu Shu Palace,
how can I help you?</i>

18:40.452 --> 18:42.283
She will be the one
who will be giving you

18:42.354 --> 18:44.413
hands-on training.

18:44.490 --> 18:47.015
<i>Gives "wax off"
a whole new meaning.</i>

18:50.062 --> 18:54.658
<i>Rule one, gweilo.
No touching my niece.</i>

18:54.733 --> 18:55.722
Understand?

18:55.801 --> 18:57.200
Yeah, I understand.

19:15.354 --> 19:16.446
What?

19:47.586 --> 19:49.213
Table jockey.

19:49.288 --> 19:51.085
Let them work it out, man.
Let them work it out.

20:17.282 --> 20:18.749
What does she weigh?
Like, 40 pounds?

20:27.492 --> 20:28.857
<i>Come on, man.
They're gonna kick your ass!</i>

20:36.668 --> 20:38.465
<i>Who wants to... Oh.</i>

20:48.914 --> 20:49.972
Maggie!

20:50.048 --> 20:53.745
Your temper brings dishonor
to my Happy Mu Shu Palace.

20:58.023 --> 20:59.320
<i>You'll be sorry, Wong!</i>

20:59.391 --> 21:02.952
<i>And teaching gweilo
is forbidden. You know that!</i>

21:03.028 --> 21:04.655
<i>I'll tell the elders.</i>

21:04.730 --> 21:08.097
You will have
to face the Dragon.

21:10.202 --> 21:13.194
Let me tell you
what you can tell the Dragon.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.920
<i>Now, gweilo, we begin.</i>

21:34.593 --> 21:38.222
Ping-Pong is not
the Macarena.

21:39.765 --> 21:42.233
It takes patience.

21:42.301 --> 21:46.670
She is like a fine,
well-aged prostitute.

21:46.738 --> 21:50.139
It takes years
to learn her tricks.

21:54.379 --> 21:56.370
She is cruel.

21:56.448 --> 21:58.609
Laughs at you
when you are naked.

22:00.285 --> 22:03.721
But you keep coming back
for more and more.

22:03.789 --> 22:04.983
Why?

22:05.057 --> 22:08.356
Because she is the
only prostitute I can afford.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.496
<i>Gweilo, give me your paddle.</i>

22:12.564 --> 22:14.259
Here.

22:14.333 --> 22:20.033
Now, for the time being,
you will practice with this.

22:21.373 --> 22:22.965
What, are you crazy?

22:23.041 --> 22:25.874
<i>It's impossible, man.
Nobody can do that.</i>

22:27.346 --> 22:29.075
That was nice.

22:29.147 --> 22:30.375
All right.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.313
Come on.

22:36.722 --> 22:38.212
One more time.

22:44.396 --> 22:45.624
Come on.

22:55.173 --> 22:56.299
Do I have to eat that?

22:56.375 --> 22:59.811
To strengthen the body
and not the mind

22:59.911 --> 23:02.709
is to build a temple
on shifting sand.

23:04.349 --> 23:06.977
In my hand I hold a cricket.

23:09.421 --> 23:12.390
<i>What'd you do that for?
Don't take the cricket
from my hand.</i>

23:12.457 --> 23:14.948
<i>Who the hell said,
"Take the cricket
from my hand"?</i>

23:15.026 --> 23:16.926
<i>I just...
Put it back.</i>

23:18.330 --> 23:21.265
That is my lucky cricket.

23:23.568 --> 23:24.592
Oh.

23:25.937 --> 23:29.634
<i>Well, he just...
He flew out of my hand, man.</i>

23:31.109 --> 23:32.542
You squished him?

23:32.611 --> 23:33.976
No.

23:34.045 --> 23:35.410
You squished lucky cricket?

23:35.480 --> 23:36.469
No.

23:39.017 --> 23:40.814
Thanks a lot, kid!

23:44.689 --> 23:50.389
<i>So, Maggie,
what do you do
when you're not here?</i>

23:50.462 --> 23:53.226
<i>So sorry,
don't speak English.</i>

23:56.668 --> 24:00.434
<i>But didn't I hear
you speak English
on the phone yesterday?</i>

24:00.505 --> 24:04.066
<i>No, you must be mistaken,
because I don't speak
any English.</i>

24:04.142 --> 24:05.939
<i>I'm just trying
to get better acquainted.</i>

24:06.011 --> 24:08.946
<i>I know what you're trying
to get, table jockey.</i>

24:09.014 --> 24:10.948
For as long as I can remember,
guys have been in here

24:11.016 --> 24:14.008
with their hands all over me,
with your stupid come-ons.

24:14.085 --> 24:16.349
<i>"Give me a hand
with my balls, Maggie."</i>

24:16.421 --> 24:17.615
Let me guess.

24:17.689 --> 24:21.056
<i>You're not around girls much
or you probably wouldn't
play Ping-Pong, right?</i>

24:21.126 --> 24:23.117
Yeah, well,
I thought that your dad
played Ping-Pong.

24:23.195 --> 24:27.222
Do not compare yourself
to my father.
My father was a great man.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.994
<i>I'm not. It's just a game.</i>

24:29.067 --> 24:31.001
<i>It's not just a game!</i>

24:31.069 --> 24:34.766
It is a proud tradition
my family have devoted
their lives to!

24:34.840 --> 24:36.671
You treat that tradition
like a joke.

24:36.741 --> 24:40.336
Uncle says you have no honor.
I say you have no shot.

24:40.412 --> 24:43.347
So turn off the charm,
table jockey.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.148
Oh, God.

24:51.790 --> 24:54.588
You need to build
wrist strength.

24:54.659 --> 24:57.685
Eye-hand coordination.

24:57.762 --> 24:59.161
Endurance.

25:01.733 --> 25:03.758
Oh, come on!

25:03.835 --> 25:08.067
<i>You got me hitting balls
with spoons.
I'm swatting flies, now?</i>

25:08.139 --> 25:11.108
You not hit flies.
You hit bees.

25:11.676 --> 25:12.768
What?

25:14.412 --> 25:15.743
Come on!

25:18.049 --> 25:19.277
Oh, shit!

25:22.454 --> 25:23.921
Oh, shit!

25:31.930 --> 25:34.694
You are halfway
through your training.

25:34.766 --> 25:36.961
Now comes the difficult part.

25:37.602 --> 25:39.092
The backhand.

25:52.050 --> 25:55.850
You must believe in yourself
when no one else does.

25:57.188 --> 25:59.383
Like right now,
for instance.

26:03.595 --> 26:04.687
What?

26:05.964 --> 26:08.194
What do you mean
I hit the net?

26:08.733 --> 26:09.859
Dad!

26:10.735 --> 26:12.225
Freeze!

26:12.771 --> 26:14.432
Hands on your head!

26:18.176 --> 26:21.612
<i>Oh, that's right, man.
I'm in Chinatown.</i>

26:21.680 --> 26:23.443
<i>I'm sorry, man.</i>

26:25.283 --> 26:28.116
Want to pop off
a couple of rounds?
Always makes me feel better.

26:28.186 --> 26:29.676
Listen to me.

26:29.754 --> 26:33.087
Are you a real,
fully-licensed FBI guy?

26:33.158 --> 26:35.752
<i>I'm serious, man.
I mean, why...</i>

26:35.827 --> 26:40.287
You know, why would
a real FBI guy
take on a mission like this?

26:40.365 --> 26:43.630
Nobody else would
be caught dead
on Operation Ping-Pong.

26:43.702 --> 26:46.830
<i>All right, they don't expect
us to catch Feng.</i>

26:46.905 --> 26:49.032
They got 20 agents
working other angles, man.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.870
<i>I'm the backup plan.</i>

26:54.613 --> 26:56.774
Look, I joined the company
for action, man.

26:56.848 --> 27:00.045
You know, car chases,
hang-gliding,
James Bond stuff.

27:00.118 --> 27:03.019
Drinking martinis,
saving girls from danger.

27:04.322 --> 27:06.085
<i>I haven't gotten
to wear a tuxedo</i>

27:06.157 --> 27:08.819
<i>since my goddaughter Martha's
quinceañera, man.</i>

27:08.893 --> 27:12.260
<i>For the last five years,
I've been at a desk, typing.</i>

27:14.366 --> 27:16.493
<i>I'm up to 70 words a minute.</i>

27:19.104 --> 27:20.264
Hello.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.739
Maggie, is that you?

27:22.807 --> 27:24.138
Slow down.

27:24.876 --> 27:26.070
Slow down in English.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.885
What happened?

27:47.966 --> 27:50.196
<i>"Teaching outsiders
is forbidden."</i>

27:50.268 --> 27:52.828
<i>We've defied the elders,
now they're shutting us down.</i>

27:52.904 --> 27:56.396
They have
forbidden me to teach
in Chinatown, forever.

27:56.474 --> 27:58.942
<i>Well, don't worry.
The FBI's gonna find out
who did this.</i>

27:59.010 --> 28:01.774
We know who did it.
It is written right there.

28:04.549 --> 28:07.109
No, no, no, no. No FBI.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.619
We will settle this
in our own way.

28:11.556 --> 28:15.925
<i>Gweilo, only
you can restore our honor.</i>

28:15.994 --> 28:17.928
You must go to the elders.

28:17.996 --> 28:20.089
You must face the Dragon.

28:20.165 --> 28:21.723
Okay, well, time out.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.598
<i>We don't have time
for some ancient Chinese
pissing contest.</i>

28:24.669 --> 28:26.330
<i>Feng's match is coming up.</i>

28:26.404 --> 28:29.066
<i>And if we want Feng's scouts
to see Randy
win some trophies,</i>

28:29.140 --> 28:31.836
we got to get him out
to some tournaments.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.343
Foolish secret agent man.

28:33.411 --> 28:35.971
Real Ping-Pong
is not played for trophies.

28:36.047 --> 28:40.040
It is played in the shadows,
in dark alleys and backrooms

28:40.118 --> 28:43.747
for hard cash
and cheap, ugly women.

28:44.756 --> 28:49.352
<i>If gweilo beats the Dragon,
it will reach Feng's ears,</i>

28:49.427 --> 28:50.894
I assure you.

28:59.938 --> 29:03.897
<i>We're here.
The lair of the Dragon.</i>

29:03.975 --> 29:05.636
From here we go alone.

29:09.948 --> 29:11.074
Good luck, kid.

29:11.149 --> 29:12.582
Thanks, man.

29:21.926 --> 29:22.915
Randy, wait.

29:22.994 --> 29:24.325
Yeah?

29:24.395 --> 29:26.727
I want you to have this.

29:26.798 --> 29:27.787
It belonged to my father.

29:27.866 --> 29:29.128
Whoa.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.795
<i>Maggie, I can't take this.</i>

29:34.773 --> 29:36.570
<i>He'd have wanted you
to have it.</i>

29:36.641 --> 29:38.666
Take it, you are ready.

29:38.743 --> 29:40.938
It has defeated many enemies.

29:42.847 --> 29:45.008
Good luck, Randy.

29:45.083 --> 29:46.277
Thanks.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.419
<i>Come, gweilo.</i>

29:52.490 --> 29:57.393
The Dragon is the most
feared table tennis player
in all Chinatown.

30:18.516 --> 30:21.144
Welcome to the underbelly
of Ping-Pong.

30:21.219 --> 30:24.450
Where fortunes
are won and lost.

30:24.522 --> 30:28.390
<i>I'm exaggerating, of course,
but you get my point.</i>

30:28.459 --> 30:30.654
People bet on Ping-Pong here.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.625
<i>So you think you're good,
huh, gweilo?</i>

30:37.702 --> 30:39.932
Well, put money
where mouth is.

30:42.941 --> 30:45.409
$4. No pay, no play.

30:46.578 --> 30:49.069
<i>Got change for $5?
That's all I got.</i>

31:12.136 --> 31:13.763
<i>This guy doesn't seem
so tough to me.</i>

31:13.838 --> 31:15.703
That is not the Dragon.

31:18.943 --> 31:21.138
That is the Dragon.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.554
<i>Gweilo,</i>

31:37.328 --> 31:40.661
remember, you suck
when you are nervous.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.024
Thanks, Master.

31:51.709 --> 31:54.610
First player
to lead by 3, wins.

31:54.679 --> 31:56.340
<i>Gweilo loses,</i>

31:56.414 --> 32:00.646
Wong and his descendants
are banished
from Chinatown forever.

32:00.718 --> 32:03.346
And by extension,
all of Orange County.

32:09.427 --> 32:13.158
<i>Dragon says,
"This serve, no can defend."</i>

32:13.231 --> 32:16.598
No one has hit it back
in five years of table tennis.

32:32.550 --> 32:35.576
<i>She say, "No fair.
She wasn't ready."</i>

32:35.653 --> 32:38.952
<i>She say, "That wasn't real
no can defend serve.</i>

32:39.023 --> 32:42.720
<i>"This next one,
this, no can defend."</i>

32:45.830 --> 32:47.354
<i>"So watch out."</i>

33:01.212 --> 33:02.736
She say,

33:02.814 --> 33:06.648
<i>"Maybe we need
to take a break.
Get some fresh air. Cool off."</i>

33:32.143 --> 33:33.508
Yes!

33:34.312 --> 33:35.779
<i>I said, "Yes!"</i>

33:37.648 --> 33:39.673
That is right!

33:40.785 --> 33:42.150
Am I right?

33:42.420 --> 33:44.251
<i>Just say, "Yes."</i>

33:44.322 --> 33:45.414
Fine!

33:51.963 --> 33:53.294
Oh, jeez.

33:55.566 --> 33:57.295
Come on, little kid.

33:57.935 --> 34:01.371
<i>Don't be so hard on yourself,
you know. You got mad skills.</i>

34:12.817 --> 34:15.149
I warn you guys,
I know tai chi.

34:37.475 --> 34:38.772
<i>Here's your money.</i>

34:41.179 --> 34:43.704
<i>Unfortunately,
it's covered in snot.</i>

34:47.784 --> 34:49.980
I knew you could do it, man!

34:50.054 --> 34:51.543
He won, right?

34:55.359 --> 34:56.849
What the hell?

35:12.910 --> 35:14.309
Mr. Daytona.

35:15.780 --> 35:19.682
<i>Your balls have been tempered
in the fury of hell's Dragon.</i>

35:25.957 --> 35:27.720
Wow!

35:27.792 --> 35:31.956
My master, Mr. Feng,
would be honored
to have you at his tournament.

35:46.410 --> 35:50.312
Which way is the freeway?
I seem to have gotten
turned around.

35:50.414 --> 35:51.813
Oh, yeah.

35:57.788 --> 35:58.982
I knew that.

35:59.056 --> 36:00.045
Yeah.

36:01.459 --> 36:04.428
<i>Mr. Daytona, we'll see you
at the tournament.</i>

36:09.867 --> 36:12.165
What?
What am I missing?

36:12.236 --> 36:14.431
Oh, we got the golden paddle.

36:16.407 --> 36:20.901
As you can see, the paddle
contains a riddle in Chinese.

36:31.322 --> 36:34.849
<i>"On the longest day,
two hands reach
towards heaven.</i>

36:34.926 --> 36:36.826
<i>"We enter the clouds."</i>

36:38.062 --> 36:39.859
Of course.

36:39.931 --> 36:42.024
When both hands reach up
on what?

36:42.099 --> 36:44.158
<i>A clock. That's noon.</i>

36:44.235 --> 36:46.965
Longest day.
Wednesday, nine letters.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.199
<i>We enter the clouds,
that's got to be an airfield.</i>

36:49.273 --> 36:52.071
Yeah, but which airfield?
There are a dozen
in Orange County alone.

36:52.143 --> 36:54.805
John Wayne Airport, maybe.
They got
a private hangar there

36:54.879 --> 36:58.838
owned by a Japanese
corporation goes by
the name of Haiku Cargo.

36:59.684 --> 37:00.946
Check this out.

37:01.018 --> 37:04.385
<i>On the longest day.
Yeah. It's 5-7-5.
That's a haiku.</i>

37:05.489 --> 37:06.751
<i>That's impressive.
Yeah.</i>

37:06.824 --> 37:08.485
<i>It's on the back of
the paddle here in English.</i>

37:08.559 --> 37:09.992
Noon, Wednesday,
John Wayne Airport.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.655
Each player can bring
a coach, a doctor,
two carry-ons.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.823
<i>Goose, run them through
the hardware they'll need.</i>

37:14.899 --> 37:16.560
I have stripped
everything down for you.

37:16.634 --> 37:19.398
This is your homing device,
this is the transmitter.

37:19.470 --> 37:23.099
<i>So you just plant it,
flip the switch
and backup's on its way.</i>

37:23.174 --> 37:25.199
<i>Don't screw this up,
Rodriguez.</i>

37:25.276 --> 37:28.973
Do not signal
unless you have proof
of what Feng is up to.

37:29.046 --> 37:31.776
<i>We don't want theories.
We want him caught red-handed,</i>

37:31.849 --> 37:33.942
with hard evidence,
so we can put him away
for good.

37:34.018 --> 37:35.042
Yes, sir.

37:35.119 --> 37:36.518
So let me guess, fellows.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.782
<i>We're gonna stick this
in the heel of our shoe,</i>

37:38.856 --> 37:41.757
put it in
a tube of toothpaste,
something like that?

37:41.826 --> 37:44.886
<i>I think we'll have
to sneak this in
the old-fashioned way.</i>

37:44.962 --> 37:47.157
<i>What's the old-fashioned way?</i>

38:13.691 --> 38:15.181
God, slow down.

38:15.259 --> 38:17.284
We should go alone from here.

38:17.361 --> 38:20.853
Good luck, secret agent man.
Take care of Uncle, okay?

38:20.931 --> 38:23.229
Uncle can take care
of himself.

38:24.235 --> 38:25.463
Oh, man.

38:27.772 --> 38:30.263
<i>What's the stick for, man?
Come on.</i>

38:36.147 --> 38:37.671
Okay.

38:37.748 --> 38:42.708
Never hug a man with
a million bucks worth of
hardware up his crack.

38:42.787 --> 38:44.448
<i>Sorry.
It's okay.</i>

38:46.290 --> 38:48.520
Go ahead and kiss her already!

38:50.328 --> 38:51.852
<i>So embarrass...</i>

39:02.406 --> 39:04.135
<i>Come back, gweilo.</i>

39:21.192 --> 39:22.250
Bye.

39:30.935 --> 39:32.402
Nice plane.

39:34.105 --> 39:35.697
Team Daytona.

39:38.008 --> 39:39.771
This way, gentlemen.

39:48.919 --> 39:52.218
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Where we going, Tijuana?

41:14.305 --> 41:17.604
It is with great honor
that I present your host.

41:19.243 --> 41:22.144
The man
who sold the Dragon his fire,

41:22.213 --> 41:24.613
stole it back,

41:24.682 --> 41:26.582
and sold it again
to the Crips.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.743
Give it up for Master Feng.

41:50.174 --> 41:51.801
<i>How's my collar?</i>

41:56.113 --> 41:57.944
Man, we were
way off George Takei.

42:05.055 --> 42:06.522
Okie-dokie artichokie.

42:06.590 --> 42:09.923
First of all,
I know getting here
was the commute from hell.

42:09.994 --> 42:13.395
I have to be a smidge
off the beaten track here.

42:13.464 --> 42:19.096
Now, Ping-Pong,
or, as the Chinese say,

42:19.169 --> 42:20.261
<i>"Ping-Pong,"</i>

42:20.337 --> 42:24.899
sport of emperors
and bandits alike.

42:24.975 --> 42:29.002
I have assembled today,
for your entertainment
pleasure,

42:29.079 --> 42:33.812
the most talented
table tennis athletes
from around the globe.

42:33.884 --> 42:36.409
Legends, every one.

42:36.487 --> 42:38.955
<i>We have last year's
North American champion</i>

42:39.023 --> 42:41.651
and holder
of the Canadian cup,

42:41.725 --> 42:44.023
<i>Mr. Freddy "Fingers" Wilson.</i>

42:46.964 --> 42:48.226
Represent.

42:48.299 --> 42:52.395
Four-time Australian champion,
Mr. Wedge McDonald!

42:57.007 --> 42:58.167
Cutie.

42:59.109 --> 43:03.876
From Japan,
Mr. Yukito Nagasaki!

43:07.885 --> 43:11.821
<i>My personal odds-on favorite
from the '88 games,</i>

43:11.889 --> 43:16.292
possibly the greatest player
ever to emerge from the West.

43:16.760 --> 43:20.526
<i>He came out of retirement
to be here,
and it's an honor to have him.</i>

43:20.598 --> 43:25.058
<i>He's back and he's bad,
the one and only
Karl Wolfschtagg!</i>

43:25.869 --> 43:27.131
Yeah!

43:28.973 --> 43:31.567
So, we meet again.

43:34.678 --> 43:37.476
The years have not been
kind to you.

43:37.548 --> 43:39.379
I will not be either.

43:39.450 --> 43:42.977
We have champions from
every continent so, please,

43:43.053 --> 43:45.078
everyone, wear a nametag.

43:50.928 --> 43:55.490
And now, eat, drink, enjoy.

44:00.404 --> 44:01.928
My goodness!

44:02.006 --> 44:04.201
What a blast from the past!

44:07.044 --> 44:09.205
<i>If it isn't my old master.</i>

44:10.981 --> 44:12.676
Wong.

44:12.750 --> 44:15.548
<i>You old horn dog.
How's tricks?</i>

44:17.788 --> 44:23.192
<i>I've waited many years
to meet you again,
face to face.</i>

44:25.629 --> 44:27.324
Oh, thank you.

44:27.398 --> 44:32.802
<i>Tell me, Randy, does he still
dress as if he shops
at Elton John's garage sale?</i>

44:32.870 --> 44:35.270
So, Randy Daytona.

44:35.339 --> 44:38.672
<i>The golden boy
who couldn't even bronze.
You're Wong's new protégé.</i>

44:38.742 --> 44:42.940
Well, FYI,

44:43.013 --> 44:45.573
Wong always said
I was his greatest pupil.

44:45.649 --> 44:49.483
I said you could have
been great, but you never
finished your training.

44:49.553 --> 44:53.353
As I recall,
you kicked me out.

44:53.424 --> 44:57.383
But you did teach me
one thing, Master.

44:57.461 --> 44:58.723
Promptness.

44:58.796 --> 45:01.629
And you were 15 minutes late
to the banquet.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.189
Soup got cold.

45:16.947 --> 45:19.142
Oh, Feng!

45:26.557 --> 45:28.752
<i>Don't let it happen again.</i>

45:30.928 --> 45:33.192
Gentlemen. Athletes.

45:33.864 --> 45:35.593
I bid you toodles.

45:51.582 --> 45:56.952
<i>May I invite you to select
from one of Mr. Feng's
courtesans of pleasure.</i>

45:57.020 --> 45:58.612
Like sex slaves?

46:02.793 --> 46:03.987
No.

46:05.395 --> 46:07.454
<i>No, I couldn't do that.</i>

46:09.333 --> 46:11.426
<i>No, I couldn't. I couldn't.</i>

46:14.171 --> 46:15.399
No, no.

46:15.472 --> 46:17.940
I got this girlfriend
back home.

46:18.008 --> 46:21.444
<i>I mean, she's not
my girlfriend. "Yet."</i>

46:21.512 --> 46:23.503
Mr. Feng has gone
to great lengths

46:23.580 --> 46:27.016
to select the most
beautiful courtesans
from around the world.

46:27.084 --> 46:31.544
They are fully versed
in both the sensual
and the erotic arts.

46:32.322 --> 46:35.018
<i>Well, I mean,
I don't want to be rude.</i>

46:49.973 --> 46:51.304
<i>What's up?</i>

46:53.310 --> 46:55.540
<i>These are...
These are all...</i>

46:55.612 --> 46:57.603
These guys,
these are dudes.

46:57.681 --> 47:02.448
They are fully prepared
to satisfy each and every one
of your desires.

47:02.519 --> 47:08.355
Well, my desires
are pretty much
all satisfied up, right now.

47:09.359 --> 47:10.826
<i>So, I'm good.</i>

47:10.894 --> 47:12.862
You must choose one.

47:15.499 --> 47:18.059
<i>Look, tell Feng
they are all so great...</i>

47:18.135 --> 47:19.966
<i>Fine. I'll pick.</i>

47:20.037 --> 47:21.129
Gary.
Yo!

47:21.205 --> 47:22.229
Feeling good?
Oh, yeah.

47:22.306 --> 47:24.365
Hop to it.
The rest of you, get out.

47:24.441 --> 47:25.669
<i>That...</i>

47:29.179 --> 47:30.339
Can I talk to you
for a second?

47:30.414 --> 47:32.905
Sweet dreams, Mr. Daytona.

47:44.161 --> 47:47.130
I got a huge day tomorrow.
Big day.

47:47.197 --> 47:48.425
<i>Can you...</i>

47:48.498 --> 47:49.522
No can do.

47:49.600 --> 47:52.763
<i>Look, if I don't spend
the night in here, it's...</i>

47:54.538 --> 47:55.527
Are you kidding me?

47:55.606 --> 47:56.595
<i>No, I'm not kidding.</i>

47:56.673 --> 47:59.107
<i>If I had known
I'd end up as a sex slave,</i>

47:59.176 --> 48:02.077
<i>I never would've gone
to that audition in Orlando.</i>

48:02.145 --> 48:03.635
I thought I was gonna be doing
cruise ship shows.

48:03.714 --> 48:06.740
Next thing I know, boom.
Sex slave.

48:06.817 --> 48:08.978
Always read
the fine print, amigo.

48:09.052 --> 48:11.919
Hey, you want a brew?
I sure could use one.

48:12.923 --> 48:14.584
Yeah.
Yeah. Cool.

48:17.160 --> 48:18.821
Here you go, dude.

48:31.275 --> 48:32.469
<i>So... So.</i>

48:35.679 --> 48:37.112
Board game?
You want to play a board game?

48:37.180 --> 48:38.977
Yes, play a board game.
Okay, cool.

48:42.019 --> 48:43.543
Whoa, you got Boggle, huh?

48:43.620 --> 48:46.180
That sounds like
a challenge to me.

48:46.256 --> 48:48.349
Yeah, okay, sure.

48:50.694 --> 48:52.059
All right.

48:53.964 --> 48:56.524
<i>Sounds like somebody's
getting lucky.</i>

49:02.706 --> 49:06.802
Oh, no, no, dude.
I want a rematch.
Best out of seven!

49:06.877 --> 49:10.074
You can not defeat me.
I am the Boggle master.

49:10.814 --> 49:13.510
Kick some ass out there.
Kick some ass, all right?

49:13.583 --> 49:14.709
All right. Thanks, man.
Appreciate it.

49:14.785 --> 49:16.252
Be careful. Okay?

49:16.320 --> 49:18.185
All we did was play Boggle.

49:18.255 --> 49:20.746
Hey, how you doing, Master?
Good morning.

49:20.824 --> 49:22.792
<i>Oh, gweilo.</i>

49:22.859 --> 49:25.327
Have you tried
these pleasure girls?

49:25.395 --> 49:28.660
My girl, she really knows
how to handle a man.

49:28.732 --> 49:29.994
Oh, boy!

49:32.002 --> 49:35.438
What the hell is up
with these courtesans
of pleasure?

49:36.206 --> 49:38.902
Master had a fantastic time
last night.

49:40.344 --> 49:42.209
Oh, man.

49:42.279 --> 49:43.303
Yeah.

49:43.380 --> 49:44.870
Did you find anything?

49:44.948 --> 49:46.848
They got this place
locked down pretty tight,

49:46.917 --> 49:48.350
<i>but I'm gonna
snoop around today.</i>

49:48.418 --> 49:49.442
Okay.

50:03.266 --> 50:04.358
Huh?

50:05.202 --> 50:07.261
He needs to go to bathroom.

50:07.838 --> 50:11.797
Down the hall,
eighth door on the left.

50:11.875 --> 50:13.570
The switch is on the right.

50:40.303 --> 50:44.000
Welcome to
my tournament of champions.

50:44.074 --> 50:48.773
The tournament
is single elimination,
sudden death.

50:50.080 --> 50:51.377
Let the games begin.

50:51.448 --> 50:54.042
The game is to 11.

50:54.117 --> 50:55.379
Must win by two.

50:56.553 --> 50:58.612
<i>The first competitors are...</i>

50:59.089 --> 51:01.284
<i>Freddy "Fingers" Wilson.</i>

51:01.358 --> 51:02.382
Wonderful.

51:02.459 --> 51:04.256
This is Freddy Fingers.

51:12.536 --> 51:13.696
<i>And...</i>

51:15.105 --> 51:16.868
Randy Daytona.

51:22.512 --> 51:24.673
<i>Hello, Feng's mansion!</i>

51:27.984 --> 51:29.747
How was Disneyland?

52:02.018 --> 52:03.451
Good luck, man.

52:03.520 --> 52:05.681
Blow it out your ass, bitch.

53:09.853 --> 53:11.218
Game point.

53:22.265 --> 53:25.257
Randy Daytona is the victor.

53:28.371 --> 53:29.429
Randy!

53:29.506 --> 53:30.871
Give it up!

53:31.308 --> 53:33.606
Can I hear a word?

53:33.677 --> 53:36.305
<i>Can I hear a double "huh-huh"?</i>

53:50.961 --> 53:52.292
Randy.

53:53.630 --> 53:55.154
<i>Fantastique.</i>

53:56.333 --> 53:58.824
Wong always did have
an eye for talent.

53:58.902 --> 54:01.029
<i>Too bad they're not good
for anything else.</i>

54:03.340 --> 54:04.534
You killed him?

54:04.608 --> 54:05.768
Well, duh.

54:05.842 --> 54:08.811
<i>What part of "sudden death"
didn't you understand?</i>

54:45.949 --> 54:47.177
Ow!

55:02.799 --> 55:04.426
<i>What's up?</i>

55:04.501 --> 55:09.029
Come, walk with me.
Randy, I have
a proposition for you.

55:10.340 --> 55:13.400
<i>I won't bite.
Not anywhere that will show.</i>

55:18.682 --> 55:22.209
Guess a guy like you has to
have a lot of security around
all the time, huh?

55:22.285 --> 55:26.278
<i>Oh, them.
They're just for show.
Nobody'd try anything in here.</i>

55:27.691 --> 55:29.352
Give me the thing.

55:30.126 --> 55:32.560
This is the real security.

55:32.629 --> 55:35.120
The whole place
is wired to blow.

55:35.198 --> 55:39.862
<i>I'd hate to have to relocate.
The place ain't much,
but it's homey.</i>

55:43.073 --> 55:44.233
Voilà.

55:49.479 --> 55:54.348
<i>I don't usually
give strangers the full tour,
but I don't know. Randy...</i>

55:57.587 --> 55:58.952
I like you.

56:02.625 --> 56:03.990
Go ahead.

56:04.060 --> 56:05.425
After you.

56:11.835 --> 56:16.431
Guns is my new business,
and business is booming.

56:16.506 --> 56:19.566
These new polymer guns
go on sale Thursday.

56:19.642 --> 56:22.270
They go right through
a metal detector.

56:22.345 --> 56:23.972
Enough shop talk.

56:31.087 --> 56:33.487
Let me show you
my pride and joy.

56:34.991 --> 56:35.980
Snazzy.

56:36.059 --> 56:37.083
Yeah.

56:37.160 --> 56:39.856
<i>It's my own private table.
Custom made.</i>

56:40.830 --> 56:43.958
You have to wear
these vests to play.

56:44.033 --> 56:48.163
The batteries in them
store enough electricity
to kill 3.8 men.

56:48.238 --> 56:50.638
Every time you miss,
the voltage doubles.

56:50.707 --> 56:53.904
Two-nothing feels like
you just stuck a fork
in a toaster.

56:53.977 --> 56:56.468
<i>Nobody's ever made it
past three-zip.</i>

56:56.546 --> 57:00.312
This guy here,
five-time world champ.

57:03.086 --> 57:06.419
Randy, let me cut through
the bullpoop.

57:06.489 --> 57:11.893
<i>I'd like you to come
and work for me as my
personal assistantlhanger-on.</i>

57:13.530 --> 57:15.054
Me?
Yeah.

57:15.131 --> 57:16.223
Why?

57:16.299 --> 57:20.099
<i>Because I think
you'd make a wonderful
addition to the Triad.</i>

57:21.204 --> 57:22.262
Really? Me?

57:22.338 --> 57:24.272
Of course not, no.

57:24.340 --> 57:28.333
<i>I want you 'cause
it would break Wong's heart.</i>

57:28.411 --> 57:32.939
Me, his old pupil,
luring his protégé
to the dark side

57:33.016 --> 57:35.075
is such a Kodak moment.

57:41.658 --> 57:46.595
Do you have any idea
how hard it is
to get a panda these days?

57:46.663 --> 57:48.062
Really hard.

57:50.099 --> 57:53.830
<i>Maybe he's dead. I'm not sure.
I'm not really sure
what they eat.</i>

57:56.673 --> 57:57.935
Oh, well.

58:04.113 --> 58:05.546
Back to the old grindstone.

58:05.615 --> 58:06.877
Oh, man.

58:27.537 --> 58:31.029
<i>You're gonna come
to the Vishnu shrine
in the bamboo grove.</i>

58:31.107 --> 58:36.739
<i>You're gonna go, lower hand
low five, lower hand low five,
upper hand high five.</i>

58:36.813 --> 58:39.213
<i>And then you're in.
You got it?</i>

58:40.483 --> 58:41.575
What?

58:44.053 --> 58:46.453
<i>If the guns are there,
I'll set the beacon
and my guys will be here</i>

58:46.523 --> 58:48.286
before he scores another
point. All right? Relax.

58:48.358 --> 58:49.882
Just hurry!

58:58.935 --> 59:01.836
I blow you a fart.
How do you like that?

59:02.906 --> 59:07.502
Randy Daytona
versus Yukito Nagasaki.

59:56.626 --> 59:58.617
This one is for you, Daytona!

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:04.499
Set and match.

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:15.334
<i>Where's everybody at?</i>

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:17.743
Coming up after the break,
the final round.

01:00:17.814 --> 01:00:21.545
Randy Daytona
versus Karl Wolfschtagg.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:31.921
You are so close to defeat,
till it already reeks
of your cheap cologne.

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:36.295
<i>The joke's on you, pretty boy.
It's not cologne,
it's Lady Speed Stick.</i>

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:39.661
Thank you, Master.

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:51.739
Listen to me. You said that
you were gonna get me out
of here, right?

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:55.045
<i>They were supposed
to be here by now.
Look, don't worry, Randy.</i>

01:00:55.118 --> 01:00:56.449
I got a plan B.

01:00:56.519 --> 01:00:57.850
You got a plan B?

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.048
Trust me.
Meet me in the john
in two minutes.

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:09.195
<i>Welcome to Feng's bathroom.</i>

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:10.289
Hey.

01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:13.665
May I interest you
in an Altoid
or some Axe Body Spray?

01:01:13.736 --> 01:01:16.534
Hey, these shoes
look like they need a shine?

01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:26.512
Hi.

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:27.708
Hi.

01:01:27.784 --> 01:01:29.217
Daytona.

01:01:29.285 --> 01:01:34.018
I have said some cruel things
about you to my friends
here at the tournament.

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:36.752
I told them that the reason
that you hate me so much

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:39.351
is because I had sex
with your mother.

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:41.863
My mother died when I was two.
I hardly knew her.

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:44.764
<i>Yeah, I know.
It's a horrible thing to say.</i>

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:50.330
And yet these things
that I say,
over and over again,

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:55.338
I do not mean them.

01:01:56.946 --> 01:01:59.141
<i>'Cause, in truth,</i>

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:02.707
you are the greatest player
I have ever seen.

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:06.014
Other than myself.

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:09.422
Practicing in front
of a mirror.

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:12.459
Which I do.

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:15.525
Every day.

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:19.600
In the nude.

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:25.600
<i>I'm sorry for you
that your papa
is not here to see you.</i>

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:27.472
I think he would
be very proud of you.

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:29.204
Yeah.

01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:33.578
So proud of you
that he would probably bet
some money on you again.

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:37.652
I could use the cash. Ha-ha.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.621
<i>Tell your dead parents
I said, "What's up?"</i>

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:02.409
<i>We're staying.</i>

01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:05.174
Win or lose,
I got to play him.

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:10.514
<i>I can't keep running away
from that German fruit salad.</i>

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:13.020
Now I am proud.

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:17.025
It is better to die
like a tiger
than to live like a pussy.

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.959
<i>I'm gonna go tell Rodriguez.</i>

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:24.930
Rodriguez?

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:31.437
Rodriguez?

01:03:32.241 --> 01:03:34.004
Open! Eat it!

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:36.409
Eat it!

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:44.811
How was I supposed to know
you were gonna
change your mind?

01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:48.448
<i>Silence. What's done is done.
Let's hope it works.</i>

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:49.786
I hate you guys.

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:52.657
<i>Mr. Feng,
there's been an accident.</i>

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:53.922
Oh, no!

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:56.891
<i>What have you...</i>

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:58.934
I broke it.

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:02.797
Oh, my God!

01:04:02.872 --> 01:04:04.237
Did that hurt?
Yes!

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:05.467
Oh, dear.

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:12.378
I have no choice.
I have to disqualify you.

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:15.144
I suppose
Karl is our champion.

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:18.517
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:20.749
This is far from over,
Daytona!

01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:21.812
You suck!

01:04:21.924 --> 01:04:25.860
Hey! Hey, come on.
That stings. Who said that?

01:04:27.263 --> 01:04:31.199
Well, poop.
Randy, I was serious
about my offer, okay?

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:33.531
And e-mail me
when you make up your mind.

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:37.903
<i>I'm Pradafan1@gmail.com.
"Pradafan" is all one word.</i>

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:40.704
<i>I can't tell you
how disappointed I am.</i>

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:58.087
<i>I'm afraid your reputation
has preceded you,
Agent Rodriguez.</i>

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:01.723
Are you still waiting
for your backup?

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:07.134
Bad guys have
homing beacons, too.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:12.068
Competition will continue
as scheduled.

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:15.702
<i>Hope you're a good southpaw.</i>

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:31.659
Three-point game.
To the death.

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:36.425
Come on.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.520
<i>I'm cool, man. I'm cool.</i>

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:09.525
Oops. Clumsy, clumsy hippos.

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:11.395
You should be more careful
with your racquet.

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:13.526
<i>It's not like
I get these shoes for free.</i>

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:15.968
Oh, wait. Yes, I do.
I do get them for free.

01:06:16.038 --> 01:06:17.471
Time out.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:21.135
<i>Master, look.
It's your brother's paddle.
It's my winning paddle.</i>

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.768
<i>I mean, I don't know
what the hell
I'm gonna do now.</i>

01:06:22.845 --> 01:06:25.279
<i>Gweilo!
Have I taught you nothing?</i>

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:29.951
Game not in paddle.
Game in you.

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:34.420
You cannot change
what is past.

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:37.882
You must play for this man.

01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:44.059
Here, use this paddle.

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:48.633
It belongs to the greatest
player I have ever known.

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:02.975
Thanks, Master.

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:19.390
<i>Gunter, glieben,
glauchen, globen</i>

01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:24.595
<i>All right</i>

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:29.811
<i>I got something to say</i>

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:34.680
<i>Yeah, it's better to burn out</i>

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:37.810
<i>Yeah, than fade away</i>

01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:42.317
<i>All right</i>

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:51.464
<i>Gonna start a fire</i>

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:55.631
<i>Come on</i>

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:57.899
<i>Rise up, gather round</i>

01:07:57.973 --> 01:08:00.168
<i>Rock this place to the ground</i>

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:02.335
<i>Burn it up, let's go for broke</i>

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.743
<i>Watch the night go up in smoke</i>

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:07.078
<i>Rock on, rock on</i>

01:08:07.149 --> 01:08:09.276
<i>Drive me crazier</i>

01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:11.581
<i>No serenade, no fire brigade</i>

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:14.350
<i>Just pyromania, come on</i>

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:16.413
<i>What do you want?</i>

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:18.118
<i>What do you want?</i>

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:20.992
<i>I want rock 'n' roll</i>

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:22.962
<i>Yes, I do</i>

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:25.227
<i>Long live rock 'n' roll</i>

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:27.166
<i>Oh, let's go,
let's strike a light</i>

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:29.227
<i>We're gonna blow like dynamite</i>

01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:37.268
<i>There will be a slight change
in today's program
for the final match.</i>

01:08:37.345 --> 01:08:40.712
<i>The part of Karl Wolfschtagg
will be played by...</i>

01:08:47.055 --> 01:08:48.990
Maggie!
Randy.

01:08:49.058 --> 01:08:50.354
Maggie!
No, Randy, no.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:54.419
You get to play her
to the death.

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:57.488
I thought this would be
much more interesting, huh?

01:08:57.566 --> 01:08:58.897
You bastard.
What?

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:01.060
This is an outrage!

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.832
This is an outrage!

01:09:02.904 --> 01:09:06.305
<i>I demand retribution!
I did not come all this way...</i>

01:09:09.944 --> 01:09:12.004
Oh, great, blow dart, yeah?

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:13.975
Super.

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:26.589
Master, you got to
help me out.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.687
You got to give me
some advice, anything, please.

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:30.755
<i>Sorry, gweilo, I'm out.</i>

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:34.768
<i>"Game not in paddle,
game in you,"
is usually my big finish.</i>

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:44.734
I missed you.

01:09:44.813 --> 01:09:45.904
I missed you, too.

01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:49.678
Hey. Less talkie-talkie.
More Ping-Pong.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.845
Three-point game to the death.

01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:00.460
Maggie, come on.

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:02.759
<i>I'm not gonna play you, Randy.</i>

01:10:04.066 --> 01:10:07.194
It would be an honor for me
to give you my life.

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:11.272
One-zero. Randy Daytona.

01:10:19.782 --> 01:10:22.512
<i>I don't know why
you couldn't just say
that you love me.</i>

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:23.677
<i>I...</i>

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:25.377
One-One.

01:10:25.454 --> 01:10:27.149
<i>That's not fair.
That wasn't fair.</i>

01:10:27.823 --> 01:10:30.690
<i>Randy, I'm trying to sacrifice
my life for our love.</i>

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:32.522
Stop being such a dick!

01:10:34.763 --> 01:10:37.061
<i>I'm not gonna let you lose,
Maggie.</i>

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:40.427
Here we go.

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:46.798
This is not very honorable!

01:10:52.848 --> 01:10:54.509
I love you, Maggie.

01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:03.754
Boring. Kill them.
Kill them both.

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:05.953
<i>We're missing
Antiques Roadshow.</i>

01:11:09.665 --> 01:11:10.757
No.

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:18.772
Oh, crap!

01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:24.941
Get to cover! Come on!

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:28.882
You want to play rough?
Okay! Go! Go! Go!

01:11:32.254 --> 01:11:35.883
Stop it! Are you insane?
These are not replicas!

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:40.224
<i>Well, some of them are,
but they're
limited edition replicas.</i>

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:42.196
<i>Backup's right outside,
they just signaled.</i>

01:11:42.264 --> 01:11:44.926
<i>I didn't sneak in
two of these for nothing.</i>

01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:51.035
<i>This is the FBI.</i>

01:12:01.517 --> 01:12:03.007
Oh, my God!
What?

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:05.610
Wait a minute,
I forgot something, guys.

01:12:05.688 --> 01:12:06.677
What?

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:08.052
Come here, baby.

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:10.916
Wish me luck.

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.017
Good luck.

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:13.561
Get to the dock!

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:15.221
He took my Uzi.

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:27.008
Get away from the door!

01:12:31.113 --> 01:12:32.341
Sweet.

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:35.440
Well, that was awesome of me.

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:38.782
<i>Dude, I totally knew
you'd rescue me!</i>

01:12:38.887 --> 01:12:43.381
Okay! All right! Okay!
All right! As a friend!
As a friend, I rescued you.

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:44.483
Oh, right. Yeah. Right.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.959
Follow me!

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:48.954
This way. Up the stairs!

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:51.365
Oh, crap!

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:57.300
So what? What?
What are you gonna do?

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:59.364
You gonna murder me
like you murdered my father?

01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:01.636
You people sound
like a broken record.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:05.476
<i>"You killed my so-and-so
and you murdered
what's- his-face."</i>

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:09.039
<i>"I demand..."
Blah-blah-blah. Get over it.</i>

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:12.982
<i>Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Don't, don't, don't. Feng.</i>

01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:16.552
Listen, you kill me now,

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:19.560
<i>we're never gonna know
who Wong's best pupil is.</i>

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:21.592
For the record,

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:25.657
I think we all assume
that it is Randy.

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:32.264
You win, Wong.

01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:34.639
<i>Let's settle this,
once and for all.</i>

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:36.143
This rescue sucks, dude.

01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:37.644
I know.
Huh?

01:13:37.713 --> 01:13:39.510
<i>Not you, you're doing great.</i>

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:44.082
Guys. Guys. Guys!

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:52.717
You, take
the self-destruct doohickey.
Just show it to the FBI.

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:56.060
Explain the house
is rigged to blow.
That will buy us time.

01:13:57.733 --> 01:13:58.927
<i>Ready, gweilo?</i>

01:14:14.049 --> 01:14:15.573
Any last words?

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:18.210
Yeah.

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:23.687
<i>Self-destruct sequence
activated.</i>

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:32.566
<i>Five minutes to detonation
and counting.</i>

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.468
<i>It's your point, Feng.</i>

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:36.936
I know. My serve, I think.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.408
<i>What the hell are you doing?
It's over, Feng.</i>

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:42.808
<i>The Ping-Pong table
doesn't know that.</i>

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:46.279
If we stop playing,
it will kill us both.

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:48.111
<i>You mean,
you can't turn it off?</i>

01:14:48.183 --> 01:14:50.083
<i>God, that's so stupid!</i>

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:51.141
Randy.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.244
Get to the boat!

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.152
<i>Okay, let's get out of here.</i>

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:56.816
<i>I'm gonna save the panda!</i>

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:02.186
<i>The panda's dead!</i>

01:15:02.798 --> 01:15:05.790
All right, FBI!
You are all under arrest!

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:07.527
FBI!

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:10.530
FBI!

01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:17.736
Oh, shit!

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:24.316
<i>That's my point, Feng.</i>

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:31.957
But you missed the table!

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:33.790
I changed the rules a little.

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:35.489
I should have told you.

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:38.658
The way I play,
you could hit it off
anything you want.

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:41.168
One bounce, it counts.
My bad.

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:42.669
Son of a bitch!

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:13.727
Guys!

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:19.971
This guy looks really tough.

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:23.300
You take him.

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:00.914
<i>Two minutes to detonation.</i>

01:17:03.685 --> 01:17:05.949
<i>You should've taken my offer.</i>

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:09.684
<i>I would've given you anything.
Anything in the world!</i>

01:17:09.758 --> 01:17:11.749
I want my father back!

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:12.987
Lots of luck!

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:32.079
Come on, get up.

01:17:32.414 --> 01:17:35.611
Come on, fast, fast, fast.
Heads down. Heads down.

01:17:35.684 --> 01:17:38.812
Get your own boat, Pedro!
I call this one.

01:17:41.356 --> 01:17:43.620
Guys! Guys!

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:48.129
Me, the money
and the Chinese broad
are taking off.

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:51.360
You see this pen?

01:17:51.433 --> 01:17:56.336
This pen contains enough
cyanide to kill everyone
within 100-yard radius.

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:58.703
<i>Do you think I'd come in here
without a backup plan?</i>

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:01.800
<i>I'm FBI, pendejo!</i>

01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:04.641
<i>Now, here's
how it's gonna go down.</i>

01:18:09.618 --> 01:18:11.882
<i>Hola. You like chorizo?</i>

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:15.316
<i>Let's get out of here.
He's gonna be really mad.</i>

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:18.553
Randy!

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:22.423
<i>Remember
what I told you, gweilo!</i>

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:26.558
Feng only finished
one-half of his training.

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:31.097
Come on.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.951
<i>I believe it's my serve, Feng.</i>

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:50.514
Big deal.
I never finished the training.

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:54.358
<i>What's that mean?
I have no honor or something?</i>

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:56.454
It means you have
no backhand.

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:19.416
Oh, shit!

01:19:37.672 --> 01:19:43.042
<i>Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six...</i>

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:44.305
Jump!

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:49.112
<i>... five, four, three,
two, one.</i>

01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:08.365
Dude, that was amazing!

01:20:08.436 --> 01:20:09.460
I love you!

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:10.562
We are so proud of you!

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:13.733
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:16.039
Seriously, stop it!

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.992
You ready, pussycat?

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:43.833
Say hello to my little friend!

01:20:47.475 --> 01:20:48.499
Are you okay?

01:20:48.577 --> 01:20:50.442
<i>Let's go, pussycat,
one more time.</i>

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:51.536
You got it?

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:52.602
Yeah.

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:55.548
Oh, no!

01:20:58.787 --> 01:20:59.776
I heard that.

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:04.015
Okay, no more games.

01:21:06.761 --> 01:21:09.195
Let me help you with that,
Master.

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:12.266
There you go.

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:16.998
<i>Hey, I wanted to thank you
for everything
that you've done for me.</i>

01:21:17.072 --> 01:21:21.475
So I got you
a little something.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:26.272
<i>It's really not necessary.</i>

01:21:26.348 --> 01:21:28.316
But Master will accept.

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:33.150
<i>What is it?
Let me guess.
It's something small.</i>

01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:34.245
<i>No, don't...</i>

01:21:34.322 --> 01:21:36.222
<i>Cufflinks? It's a ring.</i>

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:37.815
I love jewelry.

01:21:39.127 --> 01:21:41.186
<i>I can't guess. What is it?</i>

01:21:42.063 --> 01:21:44.054
<i>It's a new lucky cricket.</i>

01:21:44.466 --> 01:21:45.455
Oh.

01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:52.597
Was.

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:55.770
I shall carry it
with me always.

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:56.936
Yeah.

01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:01.848
<i>Don't bother.
He's pretty much dead.</i>

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:04.176
No, no, no.
I will carry the box.

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:07.016
It will bring my spare change
great honor.

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:09.579
Okay, you do that.
You do that.

01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:11.089
<i>Hey, gweilo!</i>

01:22:12.327 --> 01:22:13.988
I just want to say

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:18.523
no hard feelings, huh?

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.434
<i>Good luck
on the new school, gweilo.</i>

01:22:22.537 --> 01:22:23.902
Thanks, man.

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:40.012
<i>Dragon say, "May Wong's
school of table tennis
last 1,000 years.</i>

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:42.886
<i>"Or at least until the lease
is up in August."</i>

01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:45.956
Oh, thanks.

01:22:46.027 --> 01:22:48.552
<i>It's nice.
Thank you very much.</i>

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:51.497
You know, I think
we all learned
a valuable lesson.

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:00.639
<i>Dragon say, "This is
not over yet, whitey!"</i>

01:23:04.846 --> 01:23:06.473
Walk it off, Randy.

01:23:08.183 --> 01:23:14.281
A true Ping-Pong player
must always be aware
of his surroundings.

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:21.527
Master, are you all right?

01:23:22.797 --> 01:23:25.095
I am going to Disneyland.

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:29.430
Maybe we should
keep this closed.

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:33.504
<i>There's a gate here.
There's a blind man
walking around.</i>

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:18.176
Feng!

01:24:21.022 --> 01:24:22.148
Shit!

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:05.827
<i>I'm not leaving without you,
Ying-Ying!</i>

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:11.429
<i>Panda's totally fake.</i>

01:25:53.915 --> 01:25:55.348
Feng, not Fang.

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:56.974
Feng?
Feng.

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:59.144
<i>I've been calling you Fang
this whole time.</i>

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:00.812
F-E-N-G.

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:01.947
Feng?

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:03.012
All right.

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:04.080
Please.
