Makes sense though. If you knew, you wouldn't be Go Seung Tak.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.300
[Spontaneous hemothorax]

31:07.340 --> 31:10.100
Someone important to me.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.220

Please say a few words.

31:43.380 --> 31:46.820
Is it true that President Jang regained consciousness?

31:46.820 --> 31:49.300
Thanks to all of you,

31:49.300 --> 31:50.380
he finally woke up.

31:50.380 --> 31:52.420
Will he recover after that?

31:52.420 --> 31:53.580
He has to be observed for a while.

31:53.580 --> 31:54.620
But I believe he will.

31:54.620 --> 31:56.220
As for the matter of the heir, does it remain unchanged?

Let me meet him.

A visit is not allowed for the time being.

Dr. An, have you seen the news?

34:15.659 --> 34:17.980
So, you will go there to check it?

34:17.980 --> 34:20.139
Yeah, that's what you will do.

34:20.139 --> 34:22.179
But do you know where the patient is?

Dr. An?

Here...?

35:53.940 --> 35:57.300
But I'm sure Vice President Han will take care of that.

37:37.860 --> 37:40.020
Please listen to me. Do we have to do this surgery?

37:40.020 --> 37:43.980
No worries. Autotransplantation may be successful.

37:43.980 --> 37:47.780
Surgery is risky and there is a risk of recurrence.

37:47.780 --> 37:51.940
That's not the way you are, Professor Cha.

37:51.940 --> 37:59.780
Don't blame me for your greed.

37:59.780 --> 38:07.260

1:07:52.940 --> 1:07:54.460
You have to give orders. You are the chief surgeon.

1:07:54.460 --> 1:07:55.900
What are you looking at? Are we close?

1:07:55.900 --> 1:07:57.900
Of course, revenge is childish. Do you think it is a noble character?

1:07:57.900 --> 1:07:58.820
Dr. Go.

1:07:58.820 --> 1:08:01.380
What on earth do those brats want?

1:08:01.380 --> 1:08:03.980
That brat will never get the card.

1:08:03.980 --> 1:08:04.940
Se Jin, no.

1:08:04.940 --> 1:08:06.500
That is not me.

1:08:06.500 --> 1:08:08.340
I cannot die like this.
