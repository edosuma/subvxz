WEBVTT

04:26.934 --> 04:28.476
Evening, handsome.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.520
-Hey, Lucille. How you doing?
-Okay.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.733
-Evening, Hank.
-Hey, Betty. How's your mama now?

04:35.817 --> 04:37.026
She's good.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.869
Here you go.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.507
So, how you been?

05:01.051 --> 05:03.552
-Pretty good. You?
-Pretty good.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.056
How's Sonny?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.518
He's all right, I guess.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.157
-Vera, how you doing?
-I'm good. How are you?

05:25.242 --> 05:26.242
I'm good.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.119
Here.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.454
Sorry.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.458
-You want a drink?
-Oh, yeah. Thanks, hon.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.836
Wild Turkey.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.931
-Now, I'm sore, so go easy, darling.
-Yes, ma'am.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.142
Bye.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.728
-Thanks, Vera.
-You're welcome.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.396
Yeah.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.002
What's the matter, hon? You look so sad.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.255
I'm fine. Hey...

07:06.176 --> 07:08.302
You wanna get something to eat?

07:13.141 --> 07:15.309
-Talk?
-You take care, Sonny.

07:43.547 --> 07:44.797
Morning, Pop.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.219
This shit's cold. I'm gonna get some more.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.386
What the hell
those niggers doing out there?

08:34.681 --> 08:37.349
I said something to you. Did you hear me?

08:39.519 --> 08:40.561
Yeah.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.396
Damn porch monkeys.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.065
Be moving in here soon.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.152
Sitting next to me.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.905
Watching my TV.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.993
There was a time
when they knew their place.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.955
Wasn't none of this mixing going on.

09:07.464 --> 09:10.174
Your mother, she hated them niggers, too.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.855
Tell them to get the hell off my property.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.776
-You put that thing down.
-We came by to see Sonny.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.903
I don't give a damn
who you come by to see.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.780
Get them out of here right now.

09:32.864 --> 09:36.283
Tell them. They're your buddies.
Tell them to get out of here.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.994
Well, what are you standing there for?

09:51.007 --> 09:52.925
You watch your ass, all right?

10:02.185 --> 10:05.437
We'll include a 1 1/2-pound bread machine
at no extra cost to you...

10:05.522 --> 10:07.690
-You got everything you need?
-Yep.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.567
...only while supplies last, so stay tuned.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.569
Now, let's join...

10:12.654 --> 10:15.364
-Be careful walking around.
-Yeah, yeah.

10:15.699 --> 10:18.367
...as he teaches us
the secrets of losing weight,

10:18.451 --> 10:21.704
being young and fighting
disease with fresh juices.

10:32.507 --> 10:34.383
You see these two boys here?

10:35.552 --> 10:36.885
They're my sons.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.805
They were on my property.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.890
Ain't no need to be scaring no little boys.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.767
They ain't coming to hurt you.

10:43.852 --> 10:47.646
Ain't no need to be letting off no shotgun
to tell them to leave, either.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.023
You understand?

10:49.899 --> 10:52.151
Well, then keep them off my property.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.612
They're friends of your son, okay?

10:55.697 --> 10:56.697
He invited them here.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.616
They ain't trespassing,
they ain't hurting nobody.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.662
Next time you wanna play cowboy,
I'm over here all the time.

11:05.749 --> 11:08.208
-Well, you keep them off my property.
-I think you heard me, sir.

11:08.293 --> 11:11.086
Yeah, well, I think you heard me, too.
All right?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.214
Come on, boys. Let's go.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.067
Shit.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.864
-You all right, Dappa?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.908
-You sure?
-Yeah. It was loose.

11:40.992 --> 11:41.992
Yeah?

11:44.454 --> 11:46.455
Do you see what you did, Sonny?

11:47.123 --> 11:49.375
Yeah, I'm sorry. It was my mistake.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.294
-Yeah, it was.
-It won't happen next time.

11:53.338 --> 11:56.048
Let's just keep going
till we get it right, huh?

12:05.600 --> 12:07.851
That's none of your goddamn business.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.897
No, I'm surprised
you talking like that to me,

12:11.981 --> 12:13.232
you being a woman and all.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.067
I'm a liberated woman.

12:15.693 --> 12:16.735
Better watch out, Georgia Ann.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.904
Tommy's gonna sue you
for sexual harassment.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.489
Oh, that's all right.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.745
Booter, how you doing?

12:28.415 --> 12:31.792
-Just give me the $2.50, Sonny.
-I got it, Booter.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.090
-You keep the rest of it.
-Thanks, Mr. Grotowski.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.512
Just like I said, no more mistakes, all right?

12:45.723 --> 12:48.058
I wanna make damn sure
nobody makes any mistakes,

12:48.143 --> 12:49.435
especially you.

12:52.689 --> 12:57.192
So when it gets time for us to do it,
you know, you can't mess up.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.699
That goes for me, too, and the rest of them.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.371
You ain't no different than us.
You can't screw it up.

13:11.624 --> 13:15.294
-That's Hank's boy.
-You think it's in the genes?

13:15.378 --> 13:16.962
Yeah, but he is a boy.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.257
He will be a man tomorrow.

13:20.383 --> 13:24.219
In England, they go as far
as to give the guy a party the night before.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.222
They call it the Monster's Ball.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.813
They don't want no lawyer, no preacher,
or anything like that around,

13:34.898 --> 13:36.732
so it's just you and me.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.488
Like I said,
we can't think about what he did

13:42.572 --> 13:46.283
or anything else about him.
It's a job. We have to do our job right.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.966
I've been drawing a lot. What about you?

14:45.134 --> 14:46.134
Yeah.

14:48.680 --> 14:52.641
Look here. We ain't got a lot of time.

14:53.810 --> 14:58.397
I'm gonna give you all my drawings
and all my clothes.

14:59.399 --> 15:04.319
When you get older, they may fit you,
and you may want to wear them.

15:05.488 --> 15:08.574
-I'm not gonna see you again after this?
-No.

15:09.826 --> 15:10.993
Why?

15:13.830 --> 15:15.289
'Cause I'm a bad man.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.665
Who says?

15:17.500 --> 15:18.667
I do.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.047
-But I want you to know something.
-What?

15:26.384 --> 15:27.634
You ain't me.

15:28.136 --> 15:31.388
-Yes, I am.
-No, you're not.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.392
You're everything that's good about me.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.104
You're the best of what I am,
that's what you are.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.400
This man you see sitting here today,
you ain't.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.034
Hey, baby. You look nice today.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.578
You always look nice.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.167
Tyrell, tell your daddy
what you won at school.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.627
Oh, yeah, right.

16:02.086 --> 16:05.380
My drawing is gonna be used
on the school magazine cover.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.674
-You know what I did?
-What'd you do?

16:07.759 --> 16:10.886
Go on. Just tell him.
Don't be playing no guessing game.

16:11.721 --> 16:16.391
I made a picture of you,
sitting alone, in jail.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.773
Theme was solitude.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.028
Way to go, Ty. Way to go. Put it there, boy.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.448
Not too bad.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.543
What's going on with the car?

16:45.254 --> 16:47.089
It's leaking radiator fluid.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.551
You need to take it in right away.
Have them check the hoses.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.971
That car get too hot,
you gonna be in trouble.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.063
The house?

17:04.607 --> 17:05.857
I'm losing it.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.277
I can't afford to make the payments
no more.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.364
Not no more.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.951
I'm sorry, baby.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.543
Ty, let me and your mama talk for a second.

17:24.627 --> 17:25.877
Okay.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.721
Come on now.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.810
Only reason I'm here
so you could say goodbye to your son.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.521
Okay.

17:44.605 --> 17:48.275
I been coming here
for damn near 11 years, Lawrence,

17:49.902 --> 17:51.278
and I'm tired.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.281
I'm tired of coming here.

17:55.867 --> 17:58.577
-Time.
-Come on, so soon?

18:05.334 --> 18:07.294
Well, I gotta get going, baby.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.392
It's time for me to go, Ty.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.687
I'm gonna call you.
You wait by the phone, okay?

18:26.063 --> 18:29.816
Come on now.
Come on, Ty, you gotta let go. Come on.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.651
Come on, Tyrell.

18:35.823 --> 18:39.534
For every time I hurt you, I'm sorry.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.036
Come on.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.706
Ma'am, let's go.

18:45.666 --> 18:46.875
Let's go.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.045
Ma'am, let's go.

18:51.214 --> 18:54.341
I know my way out of here. Come on, Tyrell.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.731
Well, he don't have
any outstanding appeals,

19:09.816 --> 19:12.984
so, looks like
we're definitely going to do it tonight.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.279
Everybody okay?

19:16.364 --> 19:18.657
-You all right, Georgia Ann?
-I'm okay.

19:21.244 --> 19:25.205
-Dappa, is that hood ready?
-Yeah. Yeah, it's fixed and ready to go.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.414
All right.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.292
Anybody got anything to say?

19:30.002 --> 19:33.839
-Tommy.
-He likes to draw. It calms him down.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.759
Draw. Okay.

19:38.386 --> 19:41.513
Phil, will you make sure he's got
whatever it is he needs to draw with?

19:41.597 --> 19:42.639
Yes, sir.

19:44.809 --> 19:47.727
All right.
Tommy, why don't you lead us in a prayer?

19:48.271 --> 19:49.271
Okay.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.944
Open cell 13!

20:00.616 --> 20:02.492
I'm here for your stuff, man.

20:02.577 --> 20:05.912
"Now know I that the Lord
saveth his anointed.

20:06.622 --> 20:12.252
"He will hear him in his holy heaven
with the saving strength of his right hand."

20:16.465 --> 20:19.676
-Be careful with this.
-Don't worry about it, man.

20:20.136 --> 20:21.678
Close 13!

20:24.807 --> 20:26.391
Worry's all I got.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.644
"...trust in chariots, some in horses,

20:30.229 --> 20:33.106
"but we will remember
the name of the Lord our God.

20:33.816 --> 20:38.028
"They are brought down and fallen,
but we are risen and stand upright.

20:38.613 --> 20:41.364
"Save, Lord, let the king
hear us when we call."

20:41.991 --> 20:46.244
Sky surfing is when you skydive
with a board attached to your feet

20:46.329 --> 20:48.079
and try to do different maneuvers.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.665
A camera flyer flies with a camera

20:50.750 --> 20:53.460
on top of their helmet,
filming the sky surfer,

20:53.544 --> 20:56.546
and flies interactively with the sky surfer,
capturing the moves.

20:56.631 --> 20:59.382
My camera flyer
is my husband Craig O'Brien.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.514
Now, I'm gonna put
these on nice and loose.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.100
Everything gonna be okay, right?

21:09.185 --> 21:10.352
Yes, sir.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.194
What about my last phone call?

21:20.446 --> 21:22.447
Warden says it's a bad idea.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.117
Turn around.

21:31.248 --> 21:34.542
Think maybe he could call my son
and tell him that I tried?

21:35.544 --> 21:37.212
I don't think so.

21:38.339 --> 21:39.422
Okay.

21:42.385 --> 21:43.802
Open 13!

21:57.358 --> 21:59.609
Our free fall is usually around 60 seconds,

21:59.694 --> 22:04.072
and the normal altitude that
we jump from is 12,500 feet.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.199
Let's go.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.372
Close 13!

22:21.090 --> 22:24.676
...starting to feel a little cramped
by your present surroundings?

22:25.553 --> 22:27.929
Maybe it's time to expand your horizons.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.473
Maybe it's time to think about Re/Max.

22:30.558 --> 22:33.601
Re/Max and associates lead
the real estate industry...

22:33.728 --> 22:36.229
I'm gonna be right back. Stay right there.

22:37.231 --> 22:40.442
Re/Max can help you find a new home
that meets all your needs.

22:40.526 --> 22:44.571
While selling your current house to
someone who'll find it absolutely perfect...

22:44.655 --> 22:47.073
If you're looking for results,
look for Re/Max.

22:47.158 --> 22:49.200
Nobody sells more real estate.

23:13.851 --> 23:18.146
Where's my paper and pencil?
It's my right to have my paper and pencil.

23:19.023 --> 23:20.315
I know it.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.525
Your paper and pencil's on the way.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.444
I promise you this.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.380
Hey.

24:06.070 --> 24:07.362
Thank you.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.366
You're welcome.

25:12.970 --> 25:14.262
Here you go, Lawrence.

25:18.809 --> 25:20.101
Is that done?

25:24.565 --> 25:25.648
Let's see.

25:28.110 --> 25:32.447
Wow. That's nice. That's real nice.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.825
I don't look this good in person.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.621
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.333
You're welcome.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.966
You all right, Lawrence?

25:52.843 --> 25:53.885
Sonny.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.722
-Just you breathe.
-Sonny.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.061
Sonny, sit down.

26:03.437 --> 26:05.563
Sonny, I said sit down.

26:06.815 --> 26:07.815
Sit down.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.110
Come on.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.410
Come on, Lawrence.
Come on, buddy. Come on, buddy.

26:19.495 --> 26:22.872
Let's go. It's all right.
It's all right. Just let go. Let go.

26:23.666 --> 26:28.002
Let go. It's all right.
Let go. Come on. Come on.

26:41.433 --> 26:45.144
I've always believed that a portrait

26:45.646 --> 26:47.480
captures a person

26:48.023 --> 26:50.066
far better than a photograph.

26:55.698 --> 26:59.367
It truly takes a human being
to really see a human being.

27:18.345 --> 27:19.595
Wait a minute.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.431
Come here.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.569
What the hell is this, Tyrell?

27:35.738 --> 27:38.197
What'd I tell you about eating this shit?

27:38.324 --> 27:40.325
Didn't I tell you don't be eating that shit?

27:40.409 --> 27:42.827
Look at this! Look at all this fat!

27:42.911 --> 27:44.829
This fat, fat ass!

27:44.913 --> 27:47.832
Look at all this nasty fat! Where they at?

27:49.752 --> 27:51.419
Look at all this candy.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.130
You ain't gonna eat all this candy!
You crazy?

27:54.214 --> 27:56.424
Look at this room. It's a mess.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.842
Why is it a mess, Tyrell?

27:57.926 --> 28:01.012
'Cause a fat little piggy lives in this room!

28:01.096 --> 28:03.097
Get your fat ass on this scale.

28:03.307 --> 28:06.601
Get on the scale!
What does it say? What's it say?

28:06.685 --> 28:10.271
-189.
-189.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.106
You ain't lost no weight!

28:22.284 --> 28:25.953
Come on. Come on. Come on.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.499
Let's go wait for your daddy to call.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.630
It is ordered and adjudged

29:59.715 --> 30:01.340
that the judgment pronounced and set forth

30:01.425 --> 30:03.885
in this order sentencing
the defendant to death

30:03.969 --> 30:07.263
in the manner and by the authorities
as provided by statute

30:07.347 --> 30:09.599
shall be executed at this time.

31:28.929 --> 31:32.306
Lawrence Musgrove, do you have anything
you'd like to say?

31:42.025 --> 31:43.651
Push the button.

32:58.935 --> 33:03.314
Hey. You know what you did?
Do you know what you did?

33:03.398 --> 33:07.360
Are you listening to me?
Do you know what you did?

33:07.444 --> 33:10.655
Do you know what you did?
You fucked him up!

33:10.739 --> 33:12.573
You fucked up that man's last walk!

33:12.658 --> 33:15.576
How would you like it
if somebody fucked up your last walk?

33:15.661 --> 33:19.038
You're like a goddamn woman.
You're like your fucking mother!

33:20.248 --> 33:22.792
You shouldn't have done that,
you son of a bitch!

33:22.876 --> 33:25.127
Get up, you fucking pussy! Come here!

33:25.545 --> 33:29.423
You are a piece of fucking shit!
Do you understand me?

33:29.841 --> 33:31.425
Hey, hey! Hold on, hold on.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.593
Get off me!

33:33.637 --> 33:37.306
Get your fucking hands off me,
you fucking nigger!

33:37.391 --> 33:38.516
Hank! Hank!

33:39.059 --> 33:43.396
-Hank, this ain't you.
-This is me, Phil. This is me!

33:43.480 --> 33:46.023
And I'm the man
who could have your goddamn job!

33:46.108 --> 33:50.194
Don't you ever let me catch you
touching anybody that outranks you again!

33:50.278 --> 33:52.321
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, sir!

33:52.406 --> 33:54.198
-Hank...
-Yes, sir.

33:54.908 --> 33:56.867
-I don't wanna hear it out of you.
-I just keep the peace.

33:56.952 --> 33:59.495
-You piece of shit! Piece of shit!
-Hey.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.793
You got...bleeding.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.462
Sonny.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.367
All right. Let's move. Get up.

34:38.452 --> 34:40.911
You get out of
my goddamn house right now.

34:41.288 --> 34:43.998
Hey! You get out!

34:45.333 --> 34:46.417
Come on!

34:49.463 --> 34:51.380
You lousy piece of shit.

34:53.759 --> 34:54.842
Get up.

34:55.343 --> 34:58.846
What you gonna do? Huh?

34:59.097 --> 35:00.514
What you gonna do?

35:05.353 --> 35:07.354
See? How do you like that, huh?

35:08.190 --> 35:11.150
Huh? Come on! Are you a tough guy now?
Are you tough?

35:17.032 --> 35:18.324
Say something.

35:19.743 --> 35:21.327
Say something!

35:36.551 --> 35:37.802
Get up.

35:48.063 --> 35:49.438
You hate me?

35:59.449 --> 36:00.616
Answer me.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.622
You hate me, don't you?

36:07.707 --> 36:09.083
Yeah, I hate you.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.213
I always did.

36:16.216 --> 36:18.259
Well, I always loved you.

36:28.645 --> 36:30.354
Give me them scissors.

36:51.626 --> 36:52.668
Here.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.638
Hold up, wait a minute.

37:05.473 --> 37:08.183
-Where you going?
-I wanna put these up.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.444
-How much?
-That'll be $2.85.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.550
Hey, Billy. Moving as fast as I can, man.

39:04.634 --> 39:07.011
Let me just get this dress on,
and I'm gonna be right out there.

39:07.095 --> 39:09.430
-You don't need to get dressed.
-Damn car's still acting up.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.223
Leticia, listen. It's not just your car.

39:11.307 --> 39:12.516
You've been late every day this week.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.351
Billy, I've been trying to get here.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.687
I need this money.
I'm gonna lose my house.

39:16.771 --> 39:20.190
Look, why don't you go home, relax,
take some time off, you know?

39:20.275 --> 39:21.942
You shouldn't be here right now, anyway.

39:22.027 --> 39:25.195
I know that. That's why
you should've had gave me the week off.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.488
With some pay.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.616
Hell, Leticia, I already got a new girl.

39:50.638 --> 39:51.805
Hank?

39:53.641 --> 39:55.392
Let's just get this over with quick.

39:55.477 --> 39:58.395
Is there a passage
you would like me to read?

39:58.480 --> 39:59.480
No.

40:00.648 --> 40:03.442
All I want to hear
is that dirt hitting that box.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.325
He was weak.

40:18.291 --> 40:19.500
You can say a little something, though,

40:19.584 --> 40:22.086
if you want to, once we've covered him up.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.002
-How you doing?
-All right.

41:45.086 --> 41:48.755
-You want to see a menu?
-No, that's all right. I know what I want.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.842
Okay, what you gonna have?

41:52.886 --> 41:57.389
A bowl of chocolate ice cream
and a cup of coffee.

41:58.391 --> 42:01.435
-Coffee. Black, sugar, cream?
-No, black.

42:04.564 --> 42:06.273
-That's it. Yeah.
-That it?

42:21.122 --> 42:22.664
Hey, Vera, it's Hank.

42:23.750 --> 42:25.042
Is it too late?

42:27.837 --> 42:32.257
Okay, chocolate ice cream. Here you go.

42:32.634 --> 42:36.136
I'm gonna... I'm gonna need
a plastic spoon for the ice cream.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.513
Oh! Goddamn!

42:39.557 --> 42:41.099
I'm sorry about that.

42:41.559 --> 42:44.978
-It's all right.
-Shit! I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.607
-Bring me some napkins or something.
-Okay. I'm sorry about that.

42:48.691 --> 42:49.733
It's all right.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.526
-And you said a what?
-Plastic spoon.

42:51.611 --> 42:52.986
Okay, I'll get it.

42:55.281 --> 42:58.325
-Where's Lucille?
-I'm trying to fill in for her.

43:15.343 --> 43:17.177
-I'm ready to pay this.
-Yep.

43:28.898 --> 43:33.026
-What's the deal there?
-I don't know. I just over-rang this thing.

43:36.698 --> 43:37.781
If you can't get that thing open,

43:37.865 --> 43:40.867
just tell me how much it is,
and I'll pay you for it.

43:41.703 --> 43:42.869
$3.92.

43:45.456 --> 43:47.874
There's $4.00. You keep the change.

43:50.003 --> 43:51.003
Thanks.

43:52.255 --> 43:54.881
Hey, cowboy.
Feel like some late-night pussy?

43:56.134 --> 43:57.301
Guess so.

43:58.219 --> 44:00.053
Haven't seen you in a while.

44:00.388 --> 44:01.847
Yeah, well...

44:03.182 --> 44:05.100
I ain't been feeling too good.

44:06.644 --> 44:10.022
Busy, a lot of things.
This and that and the other, you know?

44:14.444 --> 44:15.485
How you been?

44:15.570 --> 44:17.029
-All right.
-Good.

44:25.121 --> 44:26.496
So, how's Sonny?

44:34.672 --> 44:36.590
I can't do this tonight, Vera.

44:36.966 --> 44:41.678
-Are you sure, hon?
-No, not tonight. I'm sorry.

44:42.221 --> 44:45.349
No need to be sorry.
Let's just do it some other time.

44:46.642 --> 44:47.851
All right.

44:52.440 --> 44:55.275
-You can keep that money.
-I'm going to.

44:59.280 --> 45:00.489
Adios.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.814
-Have a seat, Hank.
-Thank you, sir.

46:58.733 --> 47:00.525
I appreciate you seeing me.

47:01.486 --> 47:03.278
What brings you here, Hank?

47:03.779 --> 47:06.031
Sir, I'm resigning.

47:06.699 --> 47:10.160
And, I wanted to come by
and tell you personally, you know?

47:14.790 --> 47:16.500
I appreciate that, Hank.

47:20.922 --> 47:24.257
Why don't we wait a few weeks
before we submit the paperwork?

47:24.967 --> 47:27.344
That wouldn't do anybody any good
to wait on that, though.

47:27.428 --> 47:29.137
I've got my mind made up.

47:31.557 --> 47:32.599
All right.

47:34.519 --> 47:36.061
We're gonna miss you.

47:42.985 --> 47:45.070
I brought my badge in and...

47:47.949 --> 47:49.574
Why don't you keep it?

47:50.368 --> 47:52.118
I ain't got no use for it.

48:20.648 --> 48:22.148
There you are, Pop.

48:28.781 --> 48:31.992
We got each other, Son.

48:34.370 --> 48:36.663
-Remember that.
-Yes, sir.

48:46.674 --> 48:48.091
I quit the team.

49:01.647 --> 49:03.273
That was a mistake.

49:11.198 --> 49:12.782
I can't do it anymore.

49:16.329 --> 49:18.496
You're reminding me of your mother.

49:23.210 --> 49:24.961
I guess that's bad, right?

49:27.673 --> 49:29.424
Your mother wasn't shit.

49:31.385 --> 49:33.053
That woman failed me.

49:38.476 --> 49:41.811
I got more pussy after she killed herself

49:43.606 --> 49:46.066
than I did when she was living as my wife.

49:52.698 --> 49:56.409
The point is...she quit on me.

49:58.996 --> 50:00.705
You're doing the same.

50:05.252 --> 50:06.961
God damn it!

50:09.298 --> 50:11.841
Let's go. Hand me my purse.

50:12.802 --> 50:14.386
Come on. Get out.

50:14.470 --> 50:16.680
-Mama, what's wrong?
-We got to walk.

50:41.622 --> 50:43.456
Boy, get out that street!

50:44.625 --> 50:46.751
Get yourself killed. Get over here.

50:46.836 --> 50:49.796
Don't do that. Don't do that.

50:52.758 --> 50:54.968
Oh, this?
I'm telling you, this is a jim-dandy.

50:55.052 --> 50:56.469
This is just what I'm looking for.

50:56.554 --> 50:57.595
And at the same time,

50:57.680 --> 51:00.390
it's the most expensive one
I've come across, you know?

51:00.474 --> 51:03.226
But if you're willing to talk on price under...

51:03.811 --> 51:05.562
-We put quite a bit of work in it.
-I bet you did.

51:05.646 --> 51:07.188
We can talk about it.

51:07.732 --> 51:09.691
You know what?
Let me think it over. You got my number.

51:09.775 --> 51:11.526
-Sure, I got yours.
-All right.

51:11.610 --> 51:13.069
-It was a pleasure.
-Sure.

51:13.154 --> 51:14.571
-Nice seeing you.
-I'll be talking to you.

51:14.655 --> 51:16.406
-You, too.
-Okay, see you.

51:29.253 --> 51:31.045
Come on, T. Let's go.

51:34.675 --> 51:36.217
That's what you think your mama look like?

51:36.302 --> 51:37.719
Yeah, sort of.

51:37.803 --> 51:39.554
-See you tomorrow morning?
-Yeah, see you.

51:39.638 --> 51:40.722
You, too, young man.

51:40.806 --> 51:42.056
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

52:13.756 --> 52:16.591
Come on, T! Come on! Get up!

52:18.636 --> 52:20.470
Come on, T! Get up!

52:24.433 --> 52:26.726
Help me! Wait!

52:27.478 --> 52:28.728
Wait!

52:31.190 --> 52:32.607
Come back here!

52:33.442 --> 52:34.859
Help us!

52:37.613 --> 52:39.239
Come help us!

52:40.074 --> 52:41.783
Help us!

52:56.507 --> 53:00.134
T, wake up, baby. Wake up.

53:00.553 --> 53:02.720
He was hit... He was hit by a car.

53:02.805 --> 53:04.013
Calm down. Calm down.

53:04.098 --> 53:06.391
We gotta get him to a hospital right now!

53:06.475 --> 53:07.642
Right now!

53:39.675 --> 53:41.217
Hey, y'all,
we're gonna need a gurney out here.

53:41.302 --> 53:43.845
-There's a kid. I think it's pretty bad.
-Gurney!

53:43.929 --> 53:46.306
We're gonna, we're gonna need some help.

53:55.232 --> 53:56.900
Are you the boy's mother?

53:56.984 --> 53:58.359
Please, follow me.

54:01.155 --> 54:02.488
Is that your boy?

54:04.283 --> 54:05.575
-No.
-No?

54:05.659 --> 54:07.201
What happened to him?

54:08.746 --> 54:10.455
I think he got hit by a car.

54:10.539 --> 54:12.248
That was his mother, went through there.

54:12.333 --> 54:14.834
-She said he was hit by a car.
-Hit and run?

54:15.210 --> 54:17.295
Like I said, I don't know. I picked them up...

54:17.379 --> 54:20.840
Listen, I need to file a police report
if it was a hit and run.

54:21.008 --> 54:22.467
Well, shit, I don't even know the people.

54:22.551 --> 54:23.593
I wouldn't know what to write.

54:23.677 --> 54:25.094
I wouldn't know the first thing about it.

54:25.179 --> 54:27.889
Just stay, tell the police what you did,
what you saw.

54:27.973 --> 54:29.849
It'll take you 5 minutes. I promise.

54:48.160 --> 54:51.829
Wait! Wait! Wait!

55:00.881 --> 55:02.465
That's my baby!

55:04.885 --> 55:06.844
That's my baby!

55:08.806 --> 55:11.015
I know you're not supposed
to move people and everything,

55:11.100 --> 55:13.601
but, shit, I didn't know what else to do.

55:13.727 --> 55:18.815
I mean, the boy was laying there,
and the woman was hysterical.

55:20.067 --> 55:21.150
I just did the best I could do.

55:21.235 --> 55:22.902
I just thought I'd better lug him in the car

55:22.987 --> 55:25.655
and get on to here as quick as I could,
so that's what I did.

55:25.739 --> 55:28.241
All right. Well, you did a good job.

55:29.201 --> 55:33.162
-So you were just passing by?
-Yeah, I was just passing by.

55:33.247 --> 55:35.123
I don't know that lady at all.

55:37.209 --> 55:39.002
I'm gonna give you my card.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.295
We're gonna do a follow-up...

55:41.380 --> 55:43.089
If we get anything, okay?

55:43.424 --> 55:45.508
And we might call you as well
if we need to.

55:45.592 --> 55:47.218
-That's all right.
-That'd be all right?

55:47.302 --> 55:50.054
-Whatever you need me to do.
-I got your number right there.

55:50.139 --> 55:51.264
All right.

55:54.685 --> 55:56.227
Is that it? Can I go?

55:58.147 --> 56:00.106
Yeah. Thanks.

56:05.237 --> 56:07.030
That boy make it all right?

56:08.073 --> 56:09.991
No. He died.

56:38.187 --> 56:41.355
Mrs. Musgrove,
I'm gonna give you my card,

56:41.440 --> 56:42.815
and you feel free to call me

56:42.900 --> 56:46.027
anytime that you can remember
anything about this, okay?

56:46.820 --> 56:48.196
And I am so sorry.

56:48.280 --> 56:51.407
Ma'am, could you get me something
to clean that off?

56:52.826 --> 56:54.619
That's my... That's my bag.

56:59.249 --> 57:00.333
Let me go.

57:02.169 --> 57:05.963
-Here's your purse.
-He gone. My baby.

57:06.048 --> 57:07.173
Yes, ma'am.

57:08.342 --> 57:12.678
He gone. He gone.

57:15.349 --> 57:17.517
You gonna take her home, ain't you?

57:19.353 --> 57:21.062
I don't really know her.

57:23.232 --> 57:26.067
-I'll take her home.
-I think that's a good idea.

57:26.151 --> 57:27.693
Yeah, I'll take her.

57:36.245 --> 57:39.122
Could you do me a favor
and throw that away for me?

57:39.206 --> 57:40.748
-Yes, sir.
-I'd appreciate that.

57:40.833 --> 57:42.208
Take care, ma'am.

57:58.183 --> 58:00.017
Now, where do you live, hon?

58:02.938 --> 58:05.815
Ma'am, you're gonna have to tell me
where you live.

58:08.402 --> 58:11.195
Now, I'm gonna go in your purse.
I'm just letting you know.

58:11.280 --> 58:14.991
I'm going in your purse
to try to find an address on you, all right?

58:53.530 --> 58:55.406
You probably ought to call
some of your kin people

58:55.490 --> 58:57.700
or one of your friends or something.

59:05.792 --> 59:07.293
I'm gonna have to go.

59:08.754 --> 59:10.379
You gonna be all right?

59:11.423 --> 59:15.009
Police told me to call the coroner's office
in the morning.

59:17.638 --> 59:18.721
I'm sorry?

59:19.806 --> 59:22.308
They told me to call the coroner's office.

59:22.935 --> 59:25.019
Said they gonna do an autopsy.

59:27.147 --> 59:29.649
I don't know
why they gonna do an autopsy.

59:31.318 --> 59:32.985
He was hit by a car.

59:39.409 --> 59:42.328
Well, I imagine it'll help them find out
who did it.

59:43.705 --> 59:45.998
You really believe they gonna do that?

59:47.251 --> 59:49.627
I believe they'll try their best, I do.

59:51.505 --> 59:54.840
He's a black kid.
You think they gonna do that?

1:00:04.351 --> 1:00:07.603
Here's your bag.
I'm just gonna leave it on the floor here.

1:00:15.070 --> 1:00:16.362
I'm real sorry.

1:01:05.287 --> 1:01:06.537
Mr. Grotowski?

1:01:07.247 --> 1:01:10.750
Just wanted to say sorry about Sonny.
We liked him a lot.

1:01:11.501 --> 1:01:12.918
We feel bad, sir.

1:01:17.591 --> 1:01:20.343
Which one of y'all is Willie,
and which one of you's Harry?

1:01:20.427 --> 1:01:23.679
This is Willie. That's Darryl.

1:01:26.558 --> 1:01:28.601
I'll see you. I appreciate that.

1:01:44.076 --> 1:01:47.453
I'm going over to the cafe.
Do you want me to give you a ride?

1:01:49.706 --> 1:01:51.457
Sure you don't mind?

1:01:52.125 --> 1:01:54.001
I'm going that way, anyway.

1:02:08.475 --> 1:02:10.559
Is this music all right with you?

1:02:12.396 --> 1:02:15.064
-'Cause I can change it.
-No, it's cool.

1:02:17.901 --> 1:02:19.443
You ain't got a car?

1:02:20.654 --> 1:02:21.821
It's broke.

1:02:22.823 --> 1:02:24.907
I'm saving to get me another one.

1:02:37.003 --> 1:02:39.171
$8.64. Thank you.

1:02:40.298 --> 1:02:41.340
Thank you.

1:02:42.551 --> 1:02:44.468
You have a good shift, okay?

1:02:45.220 --> 1:02:46.429
Thanks.

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:51.308
Thank you.

1:03:22.883 --> 1:03:23.883
Hey, Pop.

1:03:25.218 --> 1:03:27.636
-Lookie here.
-What are those for?

1:03:28.930 --> 1:03:30.598
I bought a gas station.

1:03:32.559 --> 1:03:33.684
That right?

1:03:37.898 --> 1:03:40.649
It's all bought and paid for. We own it.

1:03:44.446 --> 1:03:46.113
Don't say "we."

1:03:46.907 --> 1:03:48.032
You own it.

1:03:49.451 --> 1:03:50.993
I didn't buy it.

1:03:52.996 --> 1:03:54.246
Yeah, well...

1:03:54.706 --> 1:03:56.999
I wouldn't have bought no gas station.

1:03:58.293 --> 1:03:59.627
Is that right?

1:04:03.715 --> 1:04:06.217
I would've stuck to what I knew best.

1:04:06.676 --> 1:04:09.762
-What's that?
-Corrections Officer.

1:04:12.015 --> 1:04:13.015
Right.

1:04:14.184 --> 1:04:17.937
Well, I ain't a Corrections Officer no more.
I'm a gas station owner.

1:04:19.981 --> 1:04:22.566
I already made the deal. It's too late, Pop.

1:04:23.193 --> 1:04:25.903
-You want me to fix you something?
-No.

1:04:26.446 --> 1:04:27.696
Suit yourself.

1:04:32.619 --> 1:04:33.619
Hey.

1:04:53.807 --> 1:04:54.974
There you go.

1:04:57.310 --> 1:04:58.561
How you doing?

1:04:59.896 --> 1:05:01.146
I'm all right.

1:05:01.940 --> 1:05:03.065
Tired.

1:05:03.775 --> 1:05:06.819
-You gonna eat something?
-Chocolate ice cream.

1:05:07.904 --> 1:05:09.238
Plastic spoon.

1:05:11.783 --> 1:05:12.908
You got it.

1:05:17.372 --> 1:05:18.497
Thank you.

1:05:22.168 --> 1:05:23.335
Are you set?

1:05:25.839 --> 1:05:28.257
About time for you to get off, isn't it?

1:05:30.468 --> 1:05:32.761
Did you want me to give you a ride?

1:05:34.180 --> 1:05:37.725
No. I...
I wouldn't think to ask you to do that.

1:05:38.184 --> 1:05:40.019
It's right on the way home.

1:05:45.400 --> 1:05:48.694
-Sure you don't mind?
-No, I'd be happy to.

1:05:49.946 --> 1:05:51.155
Okay.

1:05:54.075 --> 1:05:56.702
-The one on Prospect Street.
-Clement's?

1:05:57.370 --> 1:05:59.747
-Yeah, Clement's.
-You bought Clement's?

1:05:59.831 --> 1:06:00.831
Yeah.

1:06:01.541 --> 1:06:04.835
I know Clement. Can't stand that man.

1:06:05.170 --> 1:06:07.463
Well, he ain't gonna be running it. I am.

1:06:07.547 --> 1:06:08.964
Well, that's good.

1:06:09.883 --> 1:06:11.383
Thanks for the ride.

1:06:12.636 --> 1:06:14.386
Can I ask you a question?

1:06:18.892 --> 1:06:20.559
Why did you help me?

1:06:22.896 --> 1:06:24.229
What do you mean?

1:06:24.314 --> 1:06:26.649
When you took me and my baby
to the hospital,

1:06:26.733 --> 1:06:28.150
why'd you do that?

1:06:34.991 --> 1:06:36.700
I don't know. I guess...

1:06:37.869 --> 1:06:39.203
I just...

1:06:41.915 --> 1:06:44.416
You know, doing the right thing, I guess.

1:06:52.842 --> 1:06:54.426
My son died.

1:06:58.139 --> 1:06:59.556
And...

1:07:02.936 --> 1:07:04.103
Well, he...

1:07:05.271 --> 1:07:06.980
He died, and then...

1:07:10.402 --> 1:07:12.486
I never was a very good father.

1:07:19.285 --> 1:07:20.828
He was a good kid.

1:07:25.875 --> 1:07:28.001
I guess that somehow I just...

1:07:30.964 --> 1:07:33.090
When I seen
what you're going through there,

1:07:33.174 --> 1:07:35.384
it made me think about something,

1:07:35.468 --> 1:07:38.053
or it reminded me of something,
I don't know.

1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:43.308
You know when you feel
like you can't breathe?

1:07:55.029 --> 1:07:56.864
And, you can't get out to...

1:07:59.701 --> 1:08:01.660
From inside yourself, you know?

1:08:01.745 --> 1:08:02.828
Really.

1:08:11.796 --> 1:08:13.589
Do you want to come inside?

1:08:18.595 --> 1:08:20.387
I like these curtains.

1:08:24.184 --> 1:08:26.518
I got these here curtains on credit.

1:08:27.645 --> 1:08:31.690
I never heard of anybody getting curtains
on credit before, that I know of.

1:08:34.235 --> 1:08:36.779
What you think? They cute. Ain't they cute?

1:08:37.572 --> 1:08:39.239
I love these curtains.

1:08:40.366 --> 1:08:42.409
They're good and red, all right.

1:08:42.869 --> 1:08:44.036
I got...

1:08:45.038 --> 1:08:48.791
I got these curtains right here on credit,

1:08:49.918 --> 1:08:51.376
and the man told me

1:08:53.004 --> 1:08:55.380
that I really
wasn't supposed to get this deal.

1:08:55.465 --> 1:08:57.049
But I think he kind of liked me,

1:08:57.133 --> 1:09:00.093
and he told me I could have these curtains
on credit.

1:09:00.887 --> 1:09:02.471
I said, "Hey, what the hell?

1:09:02.555 --> 1:09:04.765
"Some red curtains
would be great for my place."

1:09:04.849 --> 1:09:08.602
So I said, "Hey, I'll take it."
So I got me some red curtains.

1:09:09.145 --> 1:09:11.355
Damn straight, huh? Just...

1:09:13.650 --> 1:09:16.068
Boy, you sure suck that whiskey down,
don't you?

1:09:16.152 --> 1:09:18.237
I mean... Lord have mercy.

1:09:21.491 --> 1:09:24.827
My husband used to love him

1:09:24.911 --> 1:09:27.120
some Jack Daniels.

1:09:29.123 --> 1:09:31.708
Well, like I said, it's...
Yeah, it's a good drink.

1:09:35.964 --> 1:09:37.923
You wait right here.
I'm gonna show you something.

1:09:38.007 --> 1:09:39.216
Okay.

1:09:41.594 --> 1:09:42.928
Sit right here.

1:09:51.521 --> 1:09:53.689
What you got there, some kind of a,

1:09:53.773 --> 1:09:56.191
some kind of an annual,
a school annual or something?

1:09:56.276 --> 1:09:57.442
No. These...

1:09:58.027 --> 1:09:59.736
These pictures right here.

1:10:03.116 --> 1:10:05.617
These are my husband's drawings
right here.

1:10:08.621 --> 1:10:09.872
Lawrence.

1:10:09.956 --> 1:10:12.624
My husband, he drew those.

1:10:18.089 --> 1:10:21.633
He got himself electrocuted
over there in Jackson.

1:10:24.262 --> 1:10:25.846
He got himself...

1:10:30.476 --> 1:10:33.353
These right here, these are my son Tyrell's.

1:10:37.567 --> 1:10:38.984
He drew these.

1:10:39.819 --> 1:10:42.613
-He drew all of these right here.
-Yeah.

1:10:46.242 --> 1:10:48.952
Got his talent from the old man, then,
I guess.

1:10:49.787 --> 1:10:50.913
Didn't he?

1:10:50.997 --> 1:10:53.582
That's the only thing
that Negro ever gave that boy,

1:10:53.666 --> 1:10:55.542
was some drawing.

1:10:55.627 --> 1:10:57.252
Taught him how to draw.

1:10:57.921 --> 1:11:00.797
-It runs in families, things like that.
-Yeah.

1:11:01.215 --> 1:11:02.674
You know, he's...

1:11:05.929 --> 1:11:09.514
He was a good kid, you know?
He was a really good kid.

1:11:10.141 --> 1:11:11.683
He was so good.

1:11:12.226 --> 1:11:15.020
He was... He really loved me.

1:11:16.856 --> 1:11:19.942
-He really loved me.
-I understand.

1:11:23.738 --> 1:11:25.697
He was so fat.

1:11:27.450 --> 1:11:29.368
He was so fat, he wouldn't...

1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:35.624
I don't care what I brought in this house,
he'd just eat it up.

1:11:35.708 --> 1:11:37.793
I don't care what it was I brought in here.

1:11:37.877 --> 1:11:39.628
I bring some Popeyes Chicken,

1:11:39.712 --> 1:11:42.047
that boy eat the whole thing
before I even get a chance

1:11:42.131 --> 1:11:43.340
to get me a bite of the chicken...

1:11:43.424 --> 1:11:47.386
He'd just eat it up! He would eat his ass off!

1:11:48.346 --> 1:11:51.056
You ain't never seen nobody eat like...

1:11:53.601 --> 1:11:56.979
He would eat candy and gumballs.

1:11:57.063 --> 1:11:59.398
He made me take him over up there
to the super Kmart...

1:11:59.482 --> 1:12:00.482
Yeah?

1:12:00.566 --> 1:12:02.776
...and he put them quarters
in that gumball machine.

1:12:02.860 --> 1:12:03.860
Yeah.

1:12:04.237 --> 1:12:07.447
He had to wait till he get the red gumball.
He had...

1:12:08.032 --> 1:12:10.283
He always had to get the red gumball.

1:12:13.204 --> 1:12:15.414
He sounds like a character, I guess.

1:12:18.251 --> 1:12:22.462
He'd get that red gumball,
and he'd just eat on that red gumball.

1:12:32.807 --> 1:12:34.433
I was a good mother.

1:12:34.642 --> 1:12:39.354
I did every single thing I can think to do.

1:12:39.439 --> 1:12:43.859
I was really good. I was really good.
I was a good mother.

1:12:43.943 --> 1:12:46.028
I was a really good mom.

1:12:47.655 --> 1:12:49.364
I didn't want him to be fat like that.

1:12:49.449 --> 1:12:51.616
I did not want my baby to be fat like that,

1:12:51.701 --> 1:12:54.077
'cause I know, a black man in America,

1:12:54.162 --> 1:12:56.621
you can't be like that, and I tried to...

1:12:58.958 --> 1:13:02.210
I was just trying to tell him
you can't be like that.

1:13:02.295 --> 1:13:05.380
You can't be like that in America
and a black man.

1:13:05.465 --> 1:13:06.715
I was just...

1:13:10.511 --> 1:13:13.430
I'm not sure...
I'm not sure what you want me to do.

1:13:14.807 --> 1:13:16.808
I want... You know what I want.

1:13:17.226 --> 1:13:21.229
I want you to make me feel better.
I want you to make me feel better.

1:13:21.314 --> 1:13:23.523
I want you to make me feel better.

1:13:24.150 --> 1:13:27.319
I want you to make me feel good.
Just make me feel good.

1:13:29.197 --> 1:13:31.406
I just want you to make me feel good.

1:13:31.491 --> 1:13:35.494
Can you make me feel good?
Can you make me feel good?

1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:37.954
Can you make me feel good?

1:13:39.707 --> 1:13:41.625
Can you make me feel good?

1:13:43.169 --> 1:13:46.296
-Feel good! Make me feel good!
-I'll help you feel good.

1:13:46.881 --> 1:13:48.590
Just make me feel good.

1:13:48.674 --> 1:13:53.345
Just make me feel good.
I want... I want to feel good. I want to feel...

1:14:56.909 --> 1:15:00.412
Fill me up. Fill me up. Fill me up.

1:15:34.947 --> 1:15:36.072
Oh, my God.

1:15:45.291 --> 1:15:47.334
Fill me. Fill me.

1:17:11.460 --> 1:17:13.295
I felt you.

1:17:15.548 --> 1:17:19.259
I needed you. I needed you so much.

1:17:22.722 --> 1:17:24.556
I needed you so much.

1:17:26.225 --> 1:17:28.560
I haven't felt anything in so long.

1:17:33.149 --> 1:17:35.859
Thank you. Thank you.

1:18:31.290 --> 1:18:32.582
You okay?

1:18:37.505 --> 1:18:38.713
Me getting sick back there

1:18:38.798 --> 1:18:41.925
doesn't have anything
to do with you, all right?

1:18:53.437 --> 1:18:54.479
Pop?

1:18:58.484 --> 1:18:59.901
Hey, Pop?

1:19:01.654 --> 1:19:03.988
I'm in the damn bathroom!

1:19:08.202 --> 1:19:09.702
What the hell happened to you?

1:19:09.787 --> 1:19:12.372
Twisted my ankle trying to take a bath.

1:19:13.999 --> 1:19:16.793
Dadgummit, I told you to be careful.

1:19:20.923 --> 1:19:22.382
-Shit.
-Oh, goddamn.

1:19:23.884 --> 1:19:25.218
Wiggle your toes.

1:19:30.558 --> 1:19:33.184
-You feel that? Yeah.
-Yeah?

1:19:37.690 --> 1:19:38.857
I'm sinking.

1:19:39.817 --> 1:19:42.610
-What are you talking about?
-I ain't worth shit.

1:19:45.698 --> 1:19:48.199
-You stop that.
-I can't clean myself.

1:19:48.951 --> 1:19:51.619
Can't walk to the kitchen without falling.

1:19:52.329 --> 1:19:55.457
Can't get to the phone
before it stops ringing.

1:19:57.668 --> 1:19:59.836
I don't feel like a man anymore.

1:20:02.548 --> 1:20:03.882
You're a man, Pop.

1:20:05.384 --> 1:20:08.595
Can't even remember
what a woman smells like.

1:20:34.079 --> 1:20:35.914
-What, baby?
-There's a man.

1:20:37.041 --> 1:20:38.166
Where?

1:20:39.251 --> 1:20:40.376
All right.

1:20:41.587 --> 1:20:42.670
Thank you.

1:20:45.341 --> 1:20:46.591
How you doing?

1:20:46.842 --> 1:20:49.093
-Hey, how you doing?
-All right.

1:20:51.680 --> 1:20:53.264
What can I do for you?

1:20:54.433 --> 1:20:58.144
I got this '89 Comanche out there,

1:20:59.188 --> 1:21:01.523
and it needs a lube job
and points and plugs,

1:21:01.607 --> 1:21:04.901
and I was kind of wondering
if you could work on it for me.

1:21:05.694 --> 1:21:08.196
Yeah. Well, when...
When do you need it by?

1:21:08.614 --> 1:21:10.573
Just quick as you can, really.

1:21:12.117 --> 1:21:13.117
Maggie.

1:21:13.744 --> 1:21:16.037
Leave that alone, baby. Put that down.

1:21:18.832 --> 1:21:19.832
Yeah.

1:21:20.751 --> 1:21:23.670
I can get that to you
about tomorrow afternoon,

1:21:23.754 --> 1:21:25.255
late tomorrow night.

1:21:26.757 --> 1:21:28.132
I'd appreciate it.

1:21:29.969 --> 1:21:32.011
Maybe those boys of yours can...

1:21:32.179 --> 1:21:33.972
If they're not doing anything,
if they're not busy,

1:21:34.056 --> 1:21:37.016
you know, they could wash it
and wax it and everything.

1:21:37.101 --> 1:21:39.227
-I'm selling it.
-All right.

1:21:41.313 --> 1:21:43.523
Yeah, I'll ask them.
You know, tell them about it.

1:21:43.607 --> 1:21:45.441
I'm sure they won't mind.

1:21:48.070 --> 1:21:49.654
I can't take this.

1:21:52.992 --> 1:21:55.577
It was my son's. It'd mean a lot to him.

1:21:55.661 --> 1:21:56.911
I'm sure he'd want it that way,

1:21:56.996 --> 1:21:58.913
want somebody to have it
to get some use out of it.

1:21:58.998 --> 1:22:01.291
Well, I ain't saying I don't want it.

1:22:02.209 --> 1:22:04.127
I just can't take it.

1:22:05.504 --> 1:22:09.048
Well, I want you to have it. I really do.
It'd mean a lot to me.

1:22:14.972 --> 1:22:17.265
Let's just take it for a little spin.

1:22:20.644 --> 1:22:21.728
Come on.

1:22:24.356 --> 1:22:26.274
I ain't even got my shoes on.

1:22:26.525 --> 1:22:29.485
That's all right. We won't go far.
Let's go. Come on.

1:22:32.573 --> 1:22:34.282
Let's see how it drives.

1:22:44.752 --> 1:22:47.587
-What the hell is this?
-Stick shift.

1:23:15.866 --> 1:23:17.241
All right, then.

1:23:18.661 --> 1:23:19.744
Here's the insurance and title,

1:23:19.828 --> 1:23:21.663
all that kind of thing,
and all the papers you'll need.

1:23:21.747 --> 1:23:23.081
-It's all set.
-Okay.

1:23:23.165 --> 1:23:26.209
Listen, I'd sure like to see you tonight, so...

1:23:26.919 --> 1:23:30.171
-Well, we should do it.
-Yeah? Is that all right?

1:23:31.340 --> 1:23:32.507
Okay.

1:23:38.222 --> 1:23:40.598
-I'll see you later.
-Okay. See you.

1:26:08.413 --> 1:26:09.664
Hank?

1:26:12.334 --> 1:26:13.751
That's good. Right there.

1:26:13.836 --> 1:26:14.836
Hello?

1:26:16.713 --> 1:26:17.922
Hank!

1:26:20.592 --> 1:26:22.134
It's Leticia.

1:26:28.433 --> 1:26:30.351
I'm coming on in, Hank.

1:26:37.401 --> 1:26:38.401
Hank?

1:26:40.112 --> 1:26:41.279
Who are you?

1:26:44.950 --> 1:26:47.326
You just walked in my house?

1:26:48.161 --> 1:26:49.161
My bad.

1:26:49.663 --> 1:26:51.122
I thought...

1:26:51.206 --> 1:26:53.833
Hank? You looking for Hank?

1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:57.169
Yes. Is he here?

1:26:58.630 --> 1:26:59.797
Who are you?

1:27:01.341 --> 1:27:05.303
My name is Leticia Musgrove, and...

1:27:06.638 --> 1:27:11.350
Me and Hank is...friends.

1:27:13.312 --> 1:27:14.645
Musgrove?

1:27:19.735 --> 1:27:21.360
Please, little darling,

1:27:23.238 --> 1:27:24.989
have you got a cigarette?

1:27:26.325 --> 1:27:27.325
Yeah.

1:27:28.660 --> 1:27:31.913
But it look to me
like you don't really need to be smoking.

1:27:36.335 --> 1:27:39.587
Come on. Have you got one?

1:27:56.229 --> 1:27:57.438
Match?

1:28:09.701 --> 1:28:12.870
So, is Hank here?

1:28:14.873 --> 1:28:17.041
Yeah, yeah. He'll be back shortly.

1:28:17.918 --> 1:28:19.835
I'm Buck, his father.

1:28:22.589 --> 1:28:23.881
That for Hank?

1:28:25.175 --> 1:28:27.385
Yeah. It's a gift.

1:28:31.056 --> 1:28:32.598
I'll see he gets it.

1:28:48.907 --> 1:28:50.116
Damn.

1:28:56.081 --> 1:29:00.084
Hank must've done something right
to deserve a fine hat like this.

1:29:03.380 --> 1:29:04.588
Guess he did.

1:29:04.881 --> 1:29:09.051
In my prime,
I had a thing for nigger juice myself.

1:29:11.763 --> 1:29:13.472
Hank just like his daddy.

1:29:14.850 --> 1:29:17.601
He ain't a man till he split dark oak.

1:29:35.787 --> 1:29:39.749
Hey, Leticia. Hang on. Where you going?

1:29:40.625 --> 1:29:44.170
Hey, where you going? What happened?

1:29:44.254 --> 1:29:45.671
-I met your daddy.
-Listen, listen...

1:29:45.756 --> 1:29:48.257
-Just get out and talk to me...
-Get off me. Get your hands off me, Hank.

1:29:48.341 --> 1:29:50.384
You at least gotta give me a chance,
whatever he did.

1:29:50.469 --> 1:29:52.261
It don't matter a whole lot, do it, Hank?

1:29:52.345 --> 1:29:53.971
Please, give me a chance to prove to you...

1:29:54.056 --> 1:29:56.390
-Get off me!
-You're just gonna...

1:30:15.327 --> 1:30:16.577
We're family.

1:30:17.621 --> 1:30:19.663
I'm your father. Remember that.

1:30:24.086 --> 1:30:25.086
Hank?

1:30:28.090 --> 1:30:29.548
What's your problem?

1:30:34.846 --> 1:30:36.639
I believe that's it. There you go.

1:30:36.723 --> 1:30:37.848
Thank you.

1:30:38.850 --> 1:30:40.976
I didn't date that thing there
at the bottom line.

1:30:41.061 --> 1:30:43.104
-I didn't know if...
-No problem.

1:30:43.855 --> 1:30:46.148
Anything below that line, I didn't do.

1:30:49.611 --> 1:30:53.030
Now, you will take good care of him,
won't you?

1:30:53.115 --> 1:30:54.198
Oh, yes.

1:30:55.951 --> 1:30:57.201
Because...

1:30:58.703 --> 1:31:00.913
Well, I want him to go out in peace.

1:31:01.873 --> 1:31:04.041
You must love him very much.

1:31:07.671 --> 1:31:08.838
No, I don't.

1:31:10.340 --> 1:31:13.592
But he's my father, so there it is.

1:31:34.364 --> 1:31:37.825
They said they were going to get you
a television set tomorrow.

1:31:38.451 --> 1:31:40.536
Finally getting rid of me, huh?

1:31:41.830 --> 1:31:43.831
They're gonna take care of you.

1:31:44.207 --> 1:31:46.041
There's a telephone
down at the end of the hall.

1:31:46.126 --> 1:31:47.501
You can call me.

1:31:47.878 --> 1:31:49.003
This is it.

1:31:50.338 --> 1:31:51.547
I guess so.

1:31:54.259 --> 1:31:55.426
I'm stuck.

1:31:57.929 --> 1:31:59.138
Me, too.

1:32:02.475 --> 1:32:04.560
I don't want to go out like this.

1:32:06.897 --> 1:32:08.147
Me, neither.

1:32:13.361 --> 1:32:14.904
Goodbye, Pop.

1:33:12.629 --> 1:33:13.837
What?

1:33:17.050 --> 1:33:20.302
-Do you want your car back?
-No, I don't want the car back.

1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:23.514
I meant for you to keep that.

1:33:23.974 --> 1:33:24.974
What?

1:33:25.684 --> 1:33:28.352
I just wanted you to know
that I sent him away.

1:33:31.564 --> 1:33:33.565
Well, I ain't got time to talk.

1:33:34.484 --> 1:33:36.610
Well, I wish you would talk to me.

1:33:39.322 --> 1:33:40.823
Y'all ready to order?

1:34:14.482 --> 1:34:17.234
-How you doing, Ryrus?
-Hey. How are you?

1:34:17.319 --> 1:34:19.403
-I'm all right.
-Who Leticia?

1:34:22.073 --> 1:34:23.532
My girlfriend.

1:34:28.455 --> 1:34:29.997
Sheriff's Department.

1:34:30.206 --> 1:34:31.373
Hello?

1:34:45.263 --> 1:34:47.973
-Who's knocking on my door?
-It's the Sheriff's Department.

1:34:48.058 --> 1:34:49.433
Time to go, lady.

1:34:49.934 --> 1:34:51.852
-No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
-It's time to go.

1:34:51.936 --> 1:34:54.980
-No. Here, here, here.
-No, no. I don't take anything.

1:34:55.065 --> 1:34:56.982
You have to settle up with your landlord,
then I go away.

1:34:57.067 --> 1:34:58.359
I got the money. Here's the money.

1:34:58.443 --> 1:35:00.736
Ma'am, I suggest you get fully dressed.

1:35:00.820 --> 1:35:02.613
-Just give me a day.
-I'm going to put you out.

1:35:02.697 --> 1:35:05.074
-Nah, you ain't putting me out.
-No, no.

1:35:05.784 --> 1:35:08.619
I about got the money.
I'm just still saving it...

1:36:14.602 --> 1:36:18.063
I painted the ceiling and the wall
and just fixed it up a little bit.

1:36:18.148 --> 1:36:19.857
I figured that I ought to.

1:36:22.026 --> 1:36:25.404
I'll move your stuff in,
so you don't have to worry with it.

1:36:27.031 --> 1:36:28.031
So...

1:36:28.575 --> 1:36:31.452
You know, I'm going to go into the kitchen
and get a thing or two,

1:36:31.536 --> 1:36:32.619
so if you just want to...

1:36:32.704 --> 1:36:36.123
Really, just, you know, relax,
make yourself comfortable,

1:36:36.207 --> 1:36:38.250
whatever you want to do with it.

1:37:26.549 --> 1:37:27.799
This Tyrell's.

1:37:28.259 --> 1:37:31.470
I thought I'd put it up there.
That's my boy's room.

1:37:33.973 --> 1:37:35.724
-So...
-All right. Here.

1:37:38.269 --> 1:37:40.145
You can go up if you want to.

1:37:46.611 --> 1:37:48.195
Can I look at these?

1:37:48.780 --> 1:37:50.072
Yeah. Go ahead.

1:37:57.956 --> 1:37:59.581
That's him right there.

1:38:03.586 --> 1:38:05.212
He don't look like you.

1:38:06.673 --> 1:38:08.423
He got his mother in him.

1:38:22.647 --> 1:38:25.566
I don't mind sleeping across the hall there
if you want me to.

1:38:25.650 --> 1:38:27.943
I mean,
maybe you should sleep by yourself.

1:38:28.027 --> 1:38:32.114
No. I wouldn't feel good
if you left me in here all by myself.

1:38:33.866 --> 1:38:36.368
I just want you to be comfortable in here.

1:38:39.247 --> 1:38:41.373
I want you to be comfortable, too.

1:39:07.692 --> 1:39:09.484
I want to take care of you.

1:39:11.487 --> 1:39:12.487
Good.

1:39:13.656 --> 1:39:16.491
Because I really need to be taken care of.

1:39:54.405 --> 1:39:55.781
Can I touch you?

1:40:00.745 --> 1:40:02.079
You sure?

1:41:04.475 --> 1:41:05.934
Did you feel that?

1:41:08.813 --> 1:41:09.980
Oh, yeah.

1:41:20.158 --> 1:41:21.616
It felt good?

1:41:26.998 --> 1:41:27.998
Yeah.

1:41:33.337 --> 1:41:35.213
I didn't hurt you or anything?

1:41:37.717 --> 1:41:39.342
Not in no bad way.

1:41:56.778 --> 1:41:57.819
What?

1:42:01.032 --> 1:42:02.657
Nothing. I just...

1:42:06.662 --> 1:42:09.080
I'm gonna go out and buy some ice cream.

1:42:13.294 --> 1:42:15.337
-Now?
-Yeah.

1:42:18.049 --> 1:42:19.549
It just feels right.

1:42:25.973 --> 1:42:28.099
-Okay.
-Well...

1:42:31.813 --> 1:42:34.481
-Can you buy me some?
-Yeah.

1:42:36.150 --> 1:42:37.651
What kind you want?

1:42:40.279 --> 1:42:41.655
Chocolate.

1:45:49.844 --> 1:45:51.052
Hey.

1:45:52.138 --> 1:45:54.264
I bought some chocolate ice cream.

1:45:57.560 --> 1:45:58.935
Are you okay?

1:46:02.732 --> 1:46:03.982
You sure?

1:46:10.948 --> 1:46:12.532
You look real pretty.

1:46:15.286 --> 1:46:17.704
Let's go down to the steps. You want to?

1:46:19.331 --> 1:46:20.540
Let's go.

1:47:50.047 --> 1:47:52.715
I went by our station on the way home.

1:47:53.759 --> 1:47:55.135
I like the sign.

1:48:12.570 --> 1:48:14.988
I think we're gonna be all right.
