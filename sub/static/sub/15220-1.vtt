October.

01:24.497 --> 01:25.652
No, November.

01:30.469 --> 01:35.998
Seed corn. Ah...

01:37.754 --> 01:39.451
and where there's seed corn...

01:40.454 --> 01:41.822
there's pheasants.

01:49.957 --> 01:50.920
Did you get him?

01:54.498 --> 01:54.947
Lisa?

01:56.112 --> 01:57.799
Sibby said you always shortcut

01:57.799 --> 01:59.299
through the corn after practice.

02:00.394 --> 02:01.042
Sibby?

02:02.683 --> 02:04.981
Lisa wants to know if you're taking

02:05.184 --> 02:06.434
anyone to the gobbler hop.

02:06.434 --> 02:08.987
Oh boy!

02:09.625 --> 02:12.001
I knew he was shy, 
but that's ridiculous.

02:40.890 --> 02:44.451
Sam! You scared ten years out of me!

02:50.692 --> 02:51.984
Mom.

04:06.698 --> 04:08.002
Supper's ready!

04:09.576 --> 04:13.168
John...supper!

04:14.752 --> 04:16.168
Your father's getting deaf from all

04:16.168 --> 04:17.469
those years on the tractor.

04:18.385 --> 04:20.000
I tell him to stuff cotton in his ears.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.738
But does he listen to me? No.

04:22.841 --> 04:24.984
He could give stubborn lessons 
to a mule.

04:26.119 --> 04:27.060
What is it?

04:34.651 --> 04:38.632
What's wrong, Sam?

04:40.447 --> 04:41.510
Nothing, I'm...

04:44.220 --> 04:45.678
I'm just really glad to see you.

04:49.853 --> 04:50.609
I'll go get dad.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.849
Ah...there you are.

05:09.971 --> 05:12.629
Why don't you wipe Aggie down 
and hook her up?

05:14.694 --> 05:15.073
Yes sir.

05:21.711 --> 05:22.821
Hello Aggie.

05:23.787 --> 05:25.335
You stayed after practice to

05:25.335 --> 05:26.727
shoot baskets, didn't you?

05:27.979 --> 05:29.666
Uh, yeah. I guess I did.

05:30.595 --> 05:31.721
Well, I admire your dedication,

05:31.721 --> 05:32.843
but, uh...

05:34.042 --> 05:35.852
you got chores to do, son.

05:37.241 --> 05:38.197
It won't happen again.

05:40.277 --> 05:41.260
The Hell it won't.

05:42.939 --> 05:45.358
Sam, you're only 16.

05:47.645 --> 05:48.739
You can't expect to play as good

05:48.739 --> 05:50.532
as your brother did his senior year.

05:51.502 --> 05:52.578
Tom was all-state.

05:52.844 --> 05:55.908
Tom was 18. You're still growing.

05:57.003 --> 05:58.195
I'm not too sure about that.

05:59.206 --> 06:01.748
Harriet, you used to do a whole lot

06:01.748 --> 06:03.352
better, but,

06:03.352 --> 06:05.475
I guess we're all getting old.

06:06.916 --> 06:08.361
You're not old, Dad.

06:10.242 --> 06:12.243
You look just the way I 
remember you.

06:12.243 --> 06:14.546
What, since you left for school this morning?

06:16.589 --> 06:18.335
I love you, Dad.

06:24.713 --> 06:25.565
Mama says if you don't come to 
supper right now,

06:25.565 --> 06:28.017
she's gonna feed it to the hogs.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.314
Katey!

06:31.276 --> 06:33.254
Look at you.

06:34.003 --> 06:35.004
You can't have it!

06:35.004 --> 06:35.816
What?

06:35.816 --> 06:37.822
Daddy, he wants Tom's bedroom.

06:38.121 --> 06:39.335
Well, Tom said I could have it.

06:40.705 --> 06:42.337
Mama says I should have it 
because I'm a girl

06:42.337 --> 06:44.701
and girls need more room than guys.

06:44.701 --> 06:46.359
Why don't you let Sam use it 
till he goes

06:46.359 --> 06:47.832
to college in the fall.

06:47.832 --> 06:49.195
Daddy!

06:49.195 --> 06:52.084
It's Ok, Dad. She can have 
Tom's room.

06:52.084 --> 06:54.108
I can?

06:54.108 --> 06:55.012
Of course you can.

06:55.012 --> 06:56.683
You can have anything you want.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.377
You're my little sister.

06:59.783 --> 07:02.580
What happened to your shirt
 down there?

07:02.580 --> 07:05.439
Come on!

07:05.439 --> 07:08.208
Gee, Katey, you're getting heavy!

07:32.487 --> 07:33.910
It's all very good.

07:35.543 --> 07:36.628
I'm glad you like it.

07:41.526 --> 07:42.723
Talk down at the feed mill is that

07:42.723 --> 07:43.832
Coach Connelly's gonna try

07:43.832 --> 07:45.772
a combination zone this year.

07:46.294 --> 07:47.782
He did. We almost beat Bentleyville.

07:53.202 --> 07:54.377
Last year...

07:55.327 --> 07:57.483
uh, last year we almost beat
 Bentleyville

07:57.483 --> 07:59.740
playing that man-to-man.

07:59.947 --> 08:04.068
You know the key is gonna be 
stopping No Nose Pruitt.

08:05.356 --> 08:07.763
That boy scored 20 points 
against us last season.

08:07.763 --> 08:09.295
He was impossible to stop.

08:09.897 --> 08:11.010
How tall is he?

08:11.010 --> 08:12.773
6' 4".

08:12.773 --> 08:14.775
6'4"?

08:14.775 --> 08:18.137
No Nose is about 6' 4".

08:18.921 --> 08:20.298
Doesn't the poor boy have a nose?

08:21.556 --> 08:23.275
The tip was cut off
 in a reaping accident.

08:24.088 --> 08:24.795
Not a pretty sight.

08:25.025 --> 08:26.812
Wanna know what I heard
 on the phone with

08:26.812 --> 08:28.124
Mary Lou the other day?

08:28.124 --> 08:30.437
She said No Nose was gonna 
kill you on friday.

08:31.051 --> 08:34.094
Oh, Katherine, why would this 
No Nose wanna do that?

08:34.363 --> 08:36.486
Because he's sweet on Lisa Parson.
 Lisa asked Sam to

08:36.486 --> 08:39.159
take her to the dance after 
the game on friday.

08:40.567 --> 08:42.629
Do you know what Sam did?

08:42.629 --> 08:44.119
Katey....

08:44.119 --> 08:46.410
He ran away.

08:46.410 --> 08:46.886
Figures.

08:46.886 --> 08:50.850
I gotta do my chores.

08:51.936 --> 08:53.763
I made peach cobbler for dessert.

08:56.005 --> 08:57.255
Peach cobbler?

08:57.255 --> 08:58.884
Oh, that sounds yumola!

08:59.704 --> 09:00.924
It is.

09:00.924 --> 09:02.591
What is?

09:04.224 --> 09:07.800
It is...time to do my chores.

09:11.559 --> 09:13.984
Uh, you know, uh, Sam,
 there might not be any

09:13.984 --> 09:16.313
peach cobbler left by the time
 you get done.

09:17.873 --> 09:19.532
I'll save you a piece.

09:20.155 --> 09:21.409
Thanks, Mom.

09:26.581 --> 09:28.473
I got a funny feeling, John.

09:28.473 --> 09:30.300
Last time you said that 
we had a flood big enough

09:30.300 --> 09:31.767
to float the ark.

09:32.040 --> 09:35.181
1957...the year I was born.

09:36.424 --> 09:38.916
I always figured you were
 God's way of making it up to us.

09:42.216 --> 09:46.630
The mind of a mature man
 in the persona of a 16-year-old at

09:46.630 --> 09:49.243
the height of his sexual powers...

09:49.756 --> 09:52.412
the possibilities are mind-boggling!

09:53.060 --> 09:54.809
Or they would be ifyou didn't run away.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.364
Well, what would you do 
if you ran into a girl

09:57.364 --> 09:58.945
who you had a crush on 25 years ago?

09:59.584 --> 10:03.832
Don't answer that. I mean...

10:05.413 --> 10:06.660
I'm a kid again, Al.

10:09.636 --> 10:11.839
I'm 16...

10:13.781 --> 10:15.298
and I'm home.

10:15.547 --> 10:17.713
And my dad's alive.

10:18.573 --> 10:20.519
I know, Kid, I know.

10:21.622 --> 10:25.428
And your in Elk Ridge, Indiana,
 and it 19...

10:25.428 --> 10:28.857
...'69. Sometime around 
Thanksgiving.

10:28.857 --> 10:30.618
How did you know that?

10:30.618 --> 10:34.950
Well, um...'69 was my senior year,

10:34.950 --> 10:37.634
and we always opened 
the basketball season

10:37.634 --> 10:40.120
against Bentleyville 
the day after Thanksgiving.

10:41.186 --> 10:43.031
Which is why you're here.

10:43.658 --> 10:45.064
Why I'm here?

10:45.064 --> 10:46.122
Yeah.

10:46.122 --> 10:48.633
Well, I haven't really been thinking

10:48.633 --> 10:49.665
much about why I'm here.

10:49.665 --> 10:51.184
You're gonna love it, Sam.

10:51.184 --> 10:51.873
Yeah?

10:51.873 --> 10:53.999
Yeah. 
Well, your team lost that game, right?

10:53.999 --> 10:54.196
Well...no.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.836
No?

10:55.836 --> 10:57.943
No. You know, I--I--I lost the game.

10:58.995 --> 11:02.357
And No Nose best me on offense 
and on defense and

11:02.357 --> 11:04.452
when the ref wasn't looking
 he just plain beat me.

11:06.359 --> 11:07.693
You don't know how many nights
 I'd lay awake wishing

11:07.693 --> 11:09.380
I could play that game over.

11:09.983 --> 11:12.879
Well, you just got your wish, Kid.

11:14.531 --> 11:15.030
You're kidding.

11:15.030 --> 11:17.162
I would never kid about basketball.

11:17.894 --> 11:20.486
Ziggy says that game was
 a turning point in the lives

11:20.486 --> 11:22.996
of a lot of people.
 If you guys could of beat Bentleyville,

11:22.996 --> 11:25.309
you would have gone on
 to win the state championship.

11:25.309 --> 11:27.329
Elk Ridge? State champs?

11:27.588 --> 11:30.703
Yeah. And your coach
 would have accepted am offer

11:30.703 --> 11:34.757
to the University of Iowa,
 and eventually wound up in the NBA.

11:34.757 --> 11:39.490
Yeah. Two of your teammates, 
Moslick and Loregro,

11:39.490 --> 11:41.659
they'd have gotten 
college basketball scholarships.

11:41.885 --> 11:42.691
They ended up doctors.

11:42.691 --> 11:46.779
Last time I heard, 
Sibby was a bank teller at First Farmers,

11:46.779 --> 11:50.801
and Herky was a-a mechanic 
at John Deere.

11:52.655 --> 11:53.591
Herky?

11:54.063 --> 11:56.554
Al...I mean, that--that's wonderful!

11:56.852 --> 11:58.435
All I have to do is help them
 win the game?

11:58.821 --> 11:59.435
That's right, kid.

11:59.435 --> 12:04.277
You beat Bentleyville friday,
 you're outta here.

12:06.545 --> 12:13.047
Al, listen, um...
I--I--I don't want to be out of here.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.432
Sam...

12:16.839 --> 12:17.744
Come on Al.

12:17.744 --> 12:19.841
My--my dad dies of a coronary in '72.

12:19.841 --> 12:21.793
That gives me 3 years to prevent it 
and Katey,

12:21.793 --> 12:27.776
she elopes with Chuck....
somebody, an abusive alcoholic.

12:28.153 --> 12:30.183
How do you convince a 12-year-old 
she shouldn't

12:30.183 --> 12:32.204
marry some guy she hasn't 
even met yet?

12:32.424 --> 12:34.151
And Tom!

12:34.151 --> 12:37.527
Tom came home--
Tom comes home for Thanksgiving

12:37.527 --> 12:38.778
before shipping out to Vietnam.

12:38.778 --> 12:41.595
God, Al, I can save Tom!

12:42.594 --> 12:44.281
I don't think so, Sam.

12:44.513 --> 12:47.459
You can't change something that 
wasn't meant to be changed.

12:47.708 --> 12:48.614
Look, I can try.

12:48.614 --> 12:50.083
Like I did with Beth?

12:50.083 --> 12:51.114
Beth?

12:51.114 --> 12:52.145
Even though we tried,

12:52.145 --> 12:53.788
Beth still married that stupid lawyer,

12:53.788 --> 12:56.341
and I came home to an empty house.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.814
It wasn't meant to be.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.659
Yeah, well...It's different.

13:02.659 --> 13:04.453
What's different?

13:04.453 --> 13:05.744
The only thing that's different 
is because

13:05.744 --> 13:07.320
this time it effects you.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.081
Exactly.

13:08.081 --> 13:11.509
Look, Al,

13:11.509 --> 13:13.446
I've been leaping around 
putting right what God

13:13.446 --> 13:14.323
or Fate or Time

13:14.323 --> 13:17.830
or whoever it is that's leaping me
 wants put right. Why?

13:18.720 --> 13:21.109
Well, you got a lot of 
boy scout in you, Sam

13:21.109 --> 13:25.449
and, because, with luck, 
one of these leaps might be your leap home.

13:25.978 --> 13:26.565
I AM home.

13:26.565 --> 13:28.364
No, this is not your home.

13:28.364 --> 13:29.175
Yes I am!

13:29.175 --> 13:32.502
Well, it might been in '69,
 but this is not 1969.

13:32.502 --> 13:38.763
It is to me! 
Al...I think I'm being rewarded.

13:39.911 --> 13:43.258
Well, that might be true,
 but Ziggy says there's a 94.3% chance--

13:43.258 --> 13:43.803
Oh, I don't give a damn
 what that hybrid computer says.

13:43.803 --> 13:46.976
I can save my father and

13:46.976 --> 13:49.478
my brother's livers and 
change my sister's for the better.

13:49.478 --> 13:51.987
Now if you were in my shoes, 
what would you do?

14:03.702 --> 14:07.742
Morning, Sam.

14:08.119 --> 14:08.964
Morning, dad.

14:08.964 --> 14:11.340
Sam, you seen my cigarettes?

14:11.688 --> 14:14.179
Uh...no, not lately.

14:14.452 --> 14:15.477
I got a...

14:15.477 --> 14:16.789
extra pack of...

14:16.789 --> 14:18.543
Lucky's in here.

14:19.964 --> 14:20.806
Where's your mother?

14:21.180 --> 14:22.584
Cleaning the silverware for
 Thanksgiving.

14:23.461 --> 14:24.745
Thelma, you seen my cigarettes?

14:26.224 --> 14:27.864
They're in the pantry where 
they always are.

14:29.216 --> 14:30.008
Want any breakfast, dad?

14:30.407 --> 14:33.315
Just coffee. I'll eat breakfast 
after I finish milking.

14:33.558 --> 14:37.284
Oh, milking's done, the chickens are fed,
 and the hogs a slopped.

14:40.733 --> 14:41.595
I finished a half hour ago.

14:45.811 --> 14:46.760
What time did you get up?

14:47.058 --> 14:50.689
Oh, I don't know. Early. 
Couldn't sleep and...

14:53.646 --> 14:54.283
Did you find your cigarettes?

14:54.283 --> 14:56.204
No I have not found my cigarettes.

14:56.719 --> 14:57.723
You must have smoked them all.

14:57.723 --> 14:58.806
Couldn't have.

14:58.806 --> 14:59.807
It's only tuesday.

14:59.807 --> 15:01.104
A carton always lasts me till friday.

15:01.104 --> 15:02.552
You know that, Thelma.

15:04.536 --> 15:05.007
What is this?

15:07.648 --> 15:08.058
Coffee.

15:09.523 --> 15:14.283
Son, this may be a lot of things,
 but coffee it isn't.

15:14.607 --> 15:15.516
It's decaffeinated coffee.

15:17.686 --> 15:21.483
De...Decaffeinated?
 Old ladies drink decaffeinated coffee.

15:21.953 --> 15:23.942
And people who need to lower 
their caffeine intake.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.352
I like my caffeine intake.

15:27.229 --> 15:29.156
It gets my heart started.

15:29.653 --> 15:30.903
So do my cigarettes.

15:32.263 --> 15:33.419
I didn't know we had any 
decaffeinated coffee.

15:33.639 --> 15:35.741
I found it in the back of the pantry.

15:35.741 --> 15:39.636
Oh Lord. That was Grandma Nettie's.

15:39.636 --> 15:41.357
It's been there since she died.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.289
Tastes like it.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.398
I'll make you a fresh pot.

15:44.398 --> 15:47.431
Mom,
 regular coffee's not good for Dad.

15:47.431 --> 15:49.183
Since when?

15:49.183 --> 15:51.686
Too much caffeine elevates 
the blood pressure.

15:51.893 --> 15:53.236
Doesn't he sound like a doctor?

15:53.236 --> 15:54.965
No doctor I want to have.

15:55.356 --> 15:57.953
Well, since the milking's done,

16:00.801 --> 16:03.048
I guess I might as well have breakfast.

16:04.413 --> 16:05.464
Right here on the table, Dad.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.946
Some fruit, skim milk, 
some bran cereal- a healthy,

16:07.946 --> 16:09.525
well-balanced breakfast.

16:09.525 --> 16:16.034
For a hippie.
 For me, breakfast is eggs, bacon, 
hash browns-

16:16.414 --> 16:19.758
And a zillion milligrams of cholesterol 
to clog your arteries.

16:19.758 --> 16:22.528
And a cigarette with regular coffee.

16:23.438 --> 16:25.405
Dad, 
you're gonna have to stop smoking and

16:26.030 --> 16:29.671
cut out foods that are high
 in cholesterol and saturated fats.

16:29.972 --> 16:32.505
That's mostly eggs, milk, and cheese,
 Dad.

16:33.224 --> 16:36.227
Katherine Beckett, 
where did you get that shirt?

16:36.429 --> 16:38.404
Are you saying that we shouldn't 
eat what we raise?

16:38.404 --> 16:39.305
No. I'm not...

16:39.305 --> 16:41.491
Take it off this instant and 
give it back to her.

16:41.491 --> 16:43.949
A lot of kids wear them.

16:43.949 --> 16:45.054
No my daughter.

16:45.264 --> 16:46.772
I don't believe this. 
I don't belive this.

16:46.978 --> 16:49.364
Mary Lou's older sister Karen,
 she came home from college...

16:49.364 --> 16:50.666
Our son is anti-dairy.

16:50.666 --> 16:51.937
I'm not anti-dairy.

16:51.937 --> 16:56.327
...Looking like a hippie.

16:56.327 --> 16:57.404
I'm just trying to save--
 I want you to be healthy.

16:57.404 --> 16:59.372
I am healthy. 
I haven't had a cold since...

16:59.372 --> 17:00.401
Yuck! Skimmed milk?

17:00.401 --> 17:02.644
Since we almost lost Harriet in the drifts, 
and that was what?

17:02.644 --> 17:02.776
Six years ago.

17:02.776 --> 17:03.904
Six years ago.

17:03.904 --> 17:04.748
Take that shirt off Kathrine, now.

17:04.748 --> 17:10.215
I'm healthy because I work hard, 
I sleep good, and I eat dairy products.

17:11.877 --> 17:16.019
Did you know that a person can thrive
 on nothing but whole milk?

17:16.674 --> 17:19.384
Not survive, but thrive.

17:20.948 --> 17:24.441
All I'm saying is you spent your entire life
 eating food high

17:24.441 --> 17:27.368
in cholesterol and
 that promotes cardiovascualer disease.

17:27.862 --> 17:30.078
Now look, you can reverse the damage
 you've done

17:30.078 --> 17:33.682
if you stop smoking and
 start on a low-cholersterol,

17:33.682 --> 17:36.365
low-fat diet and start exercising.

17:38.378 --> 17:39.815
What the Hell do you think I do all day?

17:40.158 --> 17:43.727
Well, you work hard, 
but that's anerobic.

17:44.379 --> 17:48.602
You got to get on an aerobic 
exercise program that

17:48.602 --> 17:51.677
will help your cardiovascualer system
 get back into shape.

17:52.316 --> 17:53.979
He's gonna be a doctor.

17:54.770 --> 17:58.239
I know you mean well,
 but aside from my cigarettes,

17:59.279 --> 18:03.726
I'm about as healthy as an American 
could be, and that is damn healthy.

18:06.529 --> 18:09.351
Dad, you're wrong.

18:10.664 --> 18:12.635
After a lifetime of cigarettes and 
saturated fats,

18:12.872 --> 18:16.411
your arteries are as clogged 
as our water pipes.

18:16.811 --> 18:18.193
And if you don't do something about it---

18:18.193 --> 18:23.211
I'm going into town for some cigarettes. 
You need anything, Mother?

18:24.719 --> 18:27.533
Cranberries. Two cans. The whole kind.

18:33.170 --> 18:36.910
Sam, that was a horrible thing to say 
to your father.

18:36.910 --> 18:37.708
I know.

18:37.708 --> 18:40.709
I just want to shock him 
into taking care of himself

18:40.709 --> 18:46.657
so he'll live longer than another--
so he'll live longer.

18:46.657 --> 18:48.188
What makes you think he won't?

18:48.856 --> 18:50.918
Grandpa Beckett died when he was 57.

18:51.213 --> 18:54.668
You still haven't take off that shirt.

18:55.228 --> 18:56.292
And if you don't get a move on,

18:56.558 --> 18:58.551
you'll either miss your breakfast 
or the bus.

18:59.724 --> 19:01.390
Thanksgiving vacation starts today.

19:01.905 --> 19:03.319
Then you can help me clean the silver.

19:08.586 --> 19:09.835
What did you do with them?

19:10.621 --> 19:11.289
Pardon?

19:11.289 --> 19:13.757
Your father's cigarettes.

19:16.293 --> 19:19.458
I burned them with the trash.

19:20.969 --> 19:22.319
It's just a waste of money.

19:24.591 --> 19:27.489
What, my burning them 
or his smoking them?

19:28.529 --> 19:30.021
Mom, he's got to stop.

19:30.733 --> 19:32.395
You're as stubborn as your father.

19:32.790 --> 19:33.428
I'm his son.

19:33.428 --> 19:40.278
Well, maybe I can cut out some fat
 in our meals after Thanksgiving.

19:40.765 --> 19:41.196
That would be great.

19:42.279 --> 19:45.614
But I don't want to hear anymore
 about his father dying.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.050
No one knows better that Daddy
 how young his father was when he passed on.

19:50.749 --> 19:51.784
Yes Ma'am.

19:58.777 --> 20:01.151
Al! Did you hear? It's gonna work, Al!

20:02.464 --> 20:03.559
I´m gonna change the future.

20:04.529 --> 20:06.370
I hope so, Sam. I hope so.

20:07.779 --> 20:09.013
But, in the meantime...

20:09.280 --> 20:11.684
you gotta at the basketball practise
 in 30 minutes.

20:12.996 --> 20:14.251
I'm not goin the basketball praticse.

20:15.668 --> 20:17.581
Why? Don't you wanna see
 your old buddies again...

20:17.800 --> 20:18.905
shoot some hoops with uh...

20:19.320 --> 20:21.503
Sippy and uh... Jerky...

20:21.503 --> 20:22.943
Herky.

20:24.727 --> 20:26.460
That would be great...

20:29.685 --> 20:30.990
All like a dream, Al.

20:31.928 --> 20:33.117
Well, you better enjoy it.

20:33.117 --> 20:34.525
... before you'll wake up.

20:37.491 --> 20:39.336
Ok, ok.

20:40.523 --> 20:42.124
But I'm not playing that game on friday.

20:42.573 --> 20:43.949
Why not?

20:44.699 --> 20:46.323
'Cause I don't wanna leap, that's why not.

20:46.671 --> 20:49.852
Then you don't really believe that
 you're here to help your family?

20:50.151 --> 20:51.604
Of course I do.

20:51.604 --> 20:53.555
Then why you're worried about leaping...

20:53.956 --> 20:55.439
if you win the game?

21:03.910 --> 21:05.525
Cheerleader Stand up! Sit down!

21:05.525 --> 21:09.449
Fight! Fight! Fight! Cougars! Cougars!

21:10.323 --> 21:13.920
Fight! Fight! Fight! Yea, cougars!

21:14.159 --> 21:18.870
Move the ball around, guys. 
Don't be afraid to shoot that thing.

21:20.072 --> 21:20.698
That-a-baby!

21:21.471 --> 21:22.291
Slap this, Sibby. Again.

21:23.776 --> 21:25.984
Yeah!

21:25.984 --> 21:29.231
When you girls are done playing patty cake, 
I'd like your butts over here.

21:30.314 --> 21:35.558
Let's go! Let's go! 
Hey, you girls are pretty good...

21:36.646 --> 21:39.458
against each other,
 but come friday,

21:39.707 --> 21:41.325
you're not gonna be playing 
against each other, are ya?

21:42.054 --> 21:44.273
Friday, you're gonna be playing
 against Bentleyville and--

21:44.273 --> 21:45.599
No Nose Pruitt.

21:45.805 --> 21:46.834
Exactly.

21:47.254 --> 21:51.636
The most intimidating high school 
player I have ever seen.

21:52.599 --> 21:58.642
So, I've got someone bigger and
 uglier for you to scrimmage against.

21:59.771 --> 22:00.534
Kong!

22:04.651 --> 22:06.296
Kong will be taking Munja's place.

22:08.759 --> 22:11.017
Alright, let's go, girls! 
Come on, move!

22:12.065 --> 22:17.639
Red team this way.
 Watch that monkey, Sibby, watch him.

22:18.388 --> 22:19.343
See that?

22:22.090 --> 22:22.221
you didn't protect the ball, Sibby.

22:22.596 --> 22:26.511
Don't let him intimidate you, only I am allowed to intimidate you.

22:27.293 --> 22:28.338
All right, girls. Run it again.

22:32.508 --> 22:36.145
Don't tell me, let me guess. 
Herky is the guy with the hairy face.

22:36.145 --> 22:37.659
I know him, Al, I know him.

22:38.757 --> 22:43.921
The cheerleaders. 
I bet Lisa is the one with the cute pompons.

22:45.161 --> 22:46.235
They don't have po-

22:46.235 --> 22:46.365
Anytime before Thanksgiving,
 Beckett.

23:04.131 --> 23:05.654
Take him, Beckett, take him. 
Take the ball.

23:07.968 --> 23:08.552
Damn.

23:08.552 --> 23:13.340
Block that shot. Let's go.
 Hustle! Hustle!

23:15.156 --> 23:15.700
Who is that guy?

23:17.669 --> 23:23.566
You're good. I know you don't I?

23:27.282 --> 23:28.074
Will you at least give me a hint?

23:33.281 --> 23:33.697
Tom?

23:35.541 --> 23:36.999
Ah, hello, little brother.

23:49.025 --> 23:50.619
The first six weeks were 
the worst.

23:51.210 --> 23:52.173
Especially Hell week.

23:53.035 --> 23:55.376
We ran through evolutions
 24 hours a day.

23:55.766 --> 23:56.159
Evolutions?

23:56.159 --> 23:57.999
Training Exercises.

23:58.689 --> 24:00.947
If you trained 24 hours a day,
 when did you sleep?

24:02.758 --> 24:03.311
We didn't.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.791
I got a total of 24 hours sleep 
that whole week.

24:06.092 --> 24:08.920
Of course they fed us hot meals 
every six hours.

24:09.483 --> 24:12.576
That kept you going. 
That and learning not to think

24:12.785 --> 24:14.102
beyound the evolution that I was in.

24:15.142 --> 24:16.333
I know about that.

24:18.107 --> 24:19.243
Oh, do you now little brother?

24:19.517 --> 24:22.955
Well, sort of...I mean.

24:24.282 --> 24:26.050
I have to take things one evolution 
at a time.

24:26.332 --> 24:28.175
And, uh, 
what evolution are you in now?

24:31.859 --> 24:33.993
Figuring out how to keep you
 from going to Vietnam.

24:34.991 --> 24:36.480
Oh, don't tell me 
my little brother's a dove.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.233
Not exactly.

24:38.233 --> 24:39.132
Right.

24:39.836 --> 24:41.151
I'd hate to think of you as a hippie,

24:41.682 --> 24:44.642
burning your draft card, 
shouting "Hell no, we won't go."

24:45.356 --> 24:46.090
I'd never do that.

24:46.090 --> 24:50.808
Well, I've got to admit--
it's a catchy slogan.

24:55.764 --> 24:57.829
Look, Vietnam is a losing battle.

24:58.839 --> 25:00.376
It'll drag on for a few more years.

25:00.376 --> 25:03.568
It'll take more of us and
 more of them with it, but,

25:05.132 --> 25:08.443
in the end, 
we'll get out and the North is just gonna

25:08.443 --> 25:09.616
swallow up that South anyway.

25:10.004 --> 25:11.799
So your saying it'd be ok 
to go if we were winning?

25:12.015 --> 25:15.307
If you risk your life,
 it should mean something.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.460
You don't think i'm coming back 
do ya?

25:20.464 --> 25:22.576
That--That's a possibility.

25:23.213 --> 25:24.399
Yeah, I guess it is.

25:25.087 --> 25:27.180
But I didn't join the Seals 
to miss out on the action.

25:27.840 --> 25:30.043
Vietnam is not a 
basketball game, Tom.

25:30.043 --> 25:31.215
It's a war.

25:31.215 --> 25:33.038
What's happened to you, Sam?

25:33.443 --> 25:35.739
You used to be for the flag, 
apple pie, and the Fourth of July.

25:35.991 --> 25:40.341
I still am, but I just don't want
 my brother to die for a lost cause.

25:40.341 --> 25:44.339
Sam, in buds, they pushed us 
to the limit and then beyond until we collapsed.

25:44.954 --> 25:46.574
They did it to show us 
we have outlimits.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.338
Maybe that's what Vietnam
 is doing for America.

25:49.338 --> 25:52.181
It's showing us our limits. 
That's not a lost cause.

25:52.672 --> 25:56.139
You don't have to die for it.

25:56.859 --> 25:59.492
Well, if not, how about duty. 
I took an oath, Sam.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.385
To do my duty to God and country.

26:01.668 --> 26:02.707
I know that Tom--

26:02.707 --> 26:06.937
Besides, 
I'm not gonna get killed in Nam.

26:08.197 --> 26:09.082
You can't say that.

26:09.925 --> 26:14.392
But you can say that I will?
 The truth is, little brother,

26:15.182 --> 26:17.556
neither of us can see into the future.

26:22.820 --> 26:24.323
I can.

26:24.664 --> 26:25.717
Can what?

26:25.717 --> 26:28.997
See into the future.

26:30.977 --> 26:32.482
You can, huh?

26:35.236 --> 26:40.533
You're gonna flush two birds up there. 
Hit the first one and miss the second.

27:02.089 --> 27:04.021
How many times did you flush a brace of birds?

27:05.194 --> 27:05.994
Quite a few.

27:07.716 --> 27:09.699
And how many times 
did you miss the second bird?

27:11.311 --> 27:13.091
More than I care to admit.

27:13.594 --> 27:16.001
Sam's an extremely sensitive and 
imaginitive young man

27:16.001 --> 27:17.535
under a great deal of pressure.

27:18.583 --> 27:20.655
Pressure? What--
What kind of pressure?

27:21.391 --> 27:24.130
He's only 16, John, 
and with scholarship offers

27:24.130 --> 27:25.663
from how many colleges 
and universities?

27:25.865 --> 27:26.742
A dozen.

27:26.977 --> 27:28.311
Has he made a choice?

27:28.311 --> 27:35.739
Well, he's narrowed it down to 
MIT and Cal Tech, although...

27:35.949 --> 27:41.777
I think he's holding out for a basketball scholarship from Indiana State.

27:42.499 --> 27:44.277
Nah, I talked him out of that.

27:44.879 --> 27:46.563
Why?

27:46.563 --> 27:49.443
That professor from MIt told me that 
Sam's got a brain that

27:49.443 --> 27:51.648
comes along once in a generation.

27:52.402 --> 27:54.663
Maybe once in a couple of generations.

27:54.663 --> 27:56.518
He shouldn't waste it at Indiana State.

27:56.585 --> 27:58.688
I went to premed, at Indiana State!

28:00.822 --> 28:03.155
I'm sorry, doc... 
but you know what I mean.

28:04.043 --> 28:05.197
Ok, Tom, I understand.

28:05.446 --> 28:07.540
Being I'm like him, I had protested a little.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.942
Hum, I don't think so.

28:14.703 --> 28:15.442
Oh, Tom...

28:15.442 --> 28:18.868
Since Sam could walk his fault time like a puppy.

28:19.326 --> 28:21.731
Maybe if I had a mind like Sam's,

28:23.085 --> 28:26.114
I could create a fantasy to stop my brother
 from going to Vietnam.

28:26.676 --> 28:29.681
Then what he told Tom, he just made up?

28:29.957 --> 28:32.509
Obviously so. No one travels in time.

28:36.317 --> 28:37.739
But he may not have done it consciously.

28:38.825 --> 28:44.794
What are you saying, Doc?
 Are you saying that Sam's crazy?

28:45.860 --> 28:46.271
John.

28:46.271 --> 28:48.071
Well, Thelma, what else can you call it?

28:48.457 --> 28:50.958
He's not crazy, John, he's troubled.

28:51.364 --> 28:53.711
His mind has invented a creative way
 of handling it.

28:53.992 --> 28:57.061
It's a lot better than getting drunk 
or joy riding in a stolen car.

28:57.533 --> 28:58.905
So, what do we do, Doc?

28:58.905 --> 29:00.297
We go along with him.

29:00.297 --> 29:02.414
Try to accept that he may believe 
whathe's telling you.

29:02.665 --> 29:06.997
Then after some of the pressure's off, 
he'll realize that

29:07.236 --> 29:09.205
this travelling through time was 
nothing more than a

29:09.205 --> 29:11.465
wishful dream to help him cope with his fears.

29:14.231 --> 29:17.230
I hope this doesn't effect his playing
 against Bentleyville.

29:25.235 --> 29:26.491
Bad is good?

29:27.397 --> 29:29.199
Yeah, for awhile that was the slang.

29:29.483 --> 29:30.602
Far out.

29:31.337 --> 29:32.711
Nobody says far out anymore.

29:33.104 --> 29:38.044
They say, uh...well, awesome for awhile and

29:38.044 --> 29:39.774
then radical and then--

29:39.774 --> 29:40.621
Awesome?

29:40.621 --> 29:41.335
Yeah.

29:41.335 --> 29:46.647
Oh wow. That's a lot better than far out. 
Awesome.

29:47.782 --> 29:48.364
Oh boy.

29:48.364 --> 29:50.346
So, what else can you tell me about the future?

29:53.577 --> 29:59.282
Well, you're gonna meet a boy 
in a couple of years named Chuck.

29:59.796 --> 30:02.659
Yuck. I could never go with a guy named Chuck.

30:03.286 --> 30:04.315
You're gonna elope with him.

30:04.315 --> 30:07.675
Awesome.

30:10.722 --> 30:12.285
Katey, there's a little problem.

30:14.790 --> 30:17.594
Chuck has a--a drinking problem.

30:19.648 --> 30:22.158
Got it. Don't go out with Chuck...

30:23.563 --> 30:24.909
when I meet him.

30:28.650 --> 30:29.844
You're just humoring me, aren't you?

30:30.845 --> 30:34.573
Like Dad and Mom and Tom. 
None of you really believe me.

30:36.128 --> 30:36.880
Oh my God!

30:37.264 --> 30:39.585
If you really are from the future, 
you'd know if he's dead!

30:40.297 --> 30:40.772
Chuck?

30:40.772 --> 30:42.630
Paul McCartney. The White Album.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.944
If you play "Revolution Number Nine" backwards,

30:44.944 --> 30:46.996
the Beatles are singing "Paul is dead."

30:47.848 --> 30:53.662
No. Paul's not dead. Afterthe Beatles split up--

30:53.662 --> 30:55.229
The Beatles split up?

30:57.365 --> 30:58.679
Pretty soon, I think.

30:59.366 --> 31:01.782
Oh God. Wait till I tell Elaine.

31:02.811 --> 31:04.128
Paul forms this group called Wings and

31:04.128 --> 31:05.875
they come out with some really great tunes.

31:06.441 --> 31:09.563
And John? What's John gonna do?
 He's my favorite.

31:09.563 --> 31:16.878
Uh, Katey...John--

31:16.878 --> 31:19.315
Don't tell her.

31:22.240 --> 31:25.166
John is going to write my favorite song.

31:26.165 --> 31:27.088
You favorite song?

31:27.088 --> 31:27.599
Um-hmm.

31:28.006 --> 31:28.654
In the future?

31:28.654 --> 31:29.496
Yeah.

31:29.776 --> 31:32.507
Well, sing it to me.

31:32.507 --> 31:35.329
Or are you gonna use that 
swiss cheese brain excuse you

31:35.329 --> 31:37.811
gave me when I asked you 
who'd be my first boyfriend?

31:44.712 --> 31:47.261
Imagine there's no heaven.

31:50.783 --> 31:53.385
It's easy if you try.

31:56.628 --> 31:59.376
No Hell below us.

32:02.392 --> 32:05.668
Above us only sky.

32:07.993 --> 32:09.573
Imagine all the people

32:13.458 --> 32:17.749
living for today.

32:22.434 --> 32:23.738
Imagine there's no countries.

32:26.116 --> 32:28.706
It isn't hard to do.

32:31.508 --> 32:35.149
Nothing to kill or die for.

32:37.108 --> 32:39.996
And no religion, too.

32:42.322 --> 32:46.707
Imagine all the people

32:47.489 --> 32:53.739
living life in peace.

32:54.615 --> 32:58.007
You might say I'm a dreamer.

32:59.697 --> 33:03.198
But I'm not the only one.

33:05.634 --> 33:09.800
I hope someday you'll join us

33:12.042 --> 33:15.329
and the world will live as one.

33:17.465 --> 33:19.460
Imagine no posses--

33:21.075 --> 33:22.010
Katey, what it it?

33:22.453 --> 33:23.713
I've never heard that before.

33:24.243 --> 33:25.276
Of course not,

33:25.276 --> 33:27.903
Lennon's not gonna write it 
for another couple of years.

33:28.619 --> 33:29.866
No.

33:30.399 --> 33:31.203
Sam.

33:32.024 --> 33:33.651
Katey, what is it?

33:34.038 --> 33:35.284
I don't want to believe you.

33:35.504 --> 33:36.304
Why?

33:36.304 --> 33:38.190
I don't want to believe you know the future

33:41.222 --> 33:43.850
because if you do, Tommy's gonna die.

33:49.924 --> 33:50.739
Katey...

33:51.227 --> 33:51.553
Katey.

33:52.488 --> 33:55.318
I don't want my brother to die in Vietnam.

33:56.332 --> 34:00.028
Hush, child, hush. He's not going to die.

34:00.452 --> 34:01.876
What happened?

34:03.296 --> 34:04.458
Sam told her Tom's gonna die.

34:04.893 --> 34:05.593
I didn't.

34:05.875 --> 34:07.833
Sam, I told you to keep that to yourself.

34:08.270 --> 34:11.059
Tell them you made it up.

34:11.724 --> 34:12.342
I can't.

34:12.342 --> 34:19.039
Katey, come here. I'm not going to die, ok?
 I'm not gonna die.

34:19.559 --> 34:21.857
Sam, you're not changing anything.

34:21.857 --> 34:26.311
Your father still dies in '72, 
Tom still gets killed in Vietnam,

34:26.311 --> 34:28.226
and Katey still marries Chuck.

34:28.696 --> 34:30.851
You're not changing their future, Sam,

34:31.101 --> 34:33.446
all you're doing is making their present miserable.

34:33.446 --> 34:37.543
Ok. I made it up.

34:38.884 --> 34:41.054
I made it all up.

34:41.273 --> 34:46.417
I made up everything because
 I didn't want Tom to go to Vietnam.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.527
Oh, Sam.

34:47.527 --> 34:54.152
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:00.792 --> 35:01.747
Let him go, Tom.

35:02.439 --> 35:03.873
He needs to be alone.

35:14.896 --> 35:19.152
I know it hurts, Sam, but you did the right thing.

35:22.204 --> 35:27.844
I always do--I always do the right thing Al and

35:27.844 --> 35:31.930
where does it get me?
 Why can I always save strangers,

35:31.930 --> 35:34.143
but not the people I love?

35:35.042 --> 35:36.012
I don't know.

35:36.012 --> 35:37.513
Well, I'm not gonna do it anymore.

35:39.698 --> 35:43.642
I'm not gonna do it. You hear that!?

35:44.986 --> 35:46.321
Whoever you are! Whatever you are!

35:46.321 --> 35:49.778
I'm not doing it anymore! I quit!

35:52.398 --> 35:52.945
I quit.

35:56.632 --> 35:57.276
Sam!

36:13.911 --> 36:14.689
Feel better?

36:16.097 --> 36:19.057
No, no, I don't feel better.

36:21.851 --> 36:23.048
It's not fair, Al.

36:23.744 --> 36:25.411
I mean, come on, it's not fair.

36:27.407 --> 36:29.073
Well, I think, uh,

36:30.979 --> 36:32.550
I think it's damned fair.

36:34.927 --> 36:35.238
What?

36:36.255 --> 36:40.056
I'd give anything to see my father
 and sister for a few days.

36:40.570 --> 36:44.040
To be able to talk with them again,
 laugh with them,

36:45.488 --> 36:47.106
tell them how much I love them.

36:48.138 --> 36:53.535
I'd give anything to have what you have,
 Sam, anything.

37:04.614 --> 37:10.549
Dear Lord, do see fit to protect and 
watch over our son Tom.

37:14.176 --> 37:15.068
Amen.

37:15.068 --> 37:16.055
Amen.

37:16.055 --> 37:17.024
Amen.

37:20.332 --> 37:20.933
Amen.

37:42.916 --> 37:43.859
Are you going to pass me those cranberries,

37:43.859 --> 37:45.565
or are you going to sleep with them tonight?

37:52.228 --> 37:54.122
Are you going to go dancing with Lisa
 after the game?

38:19.076 --> 38:19.574
Hoo-yah!

38:19.844 --> 38:21.510
Hoo-yah? What's hoo-yah?

38:21.940 --> 38:23.396
It's a yell used in Seal training.

38:26.418 --> 38:28.913
Nope. That hook won't work against No Nose.

38:29.210 --> 38:30.229
He's bigger than you are.

38:31.931 --> 38:33.023
Try adding a jump to it.

38:35.693 --> 38:38.512
Did you have a good Thanksgiving, Sam?

38:38.929 --> 38:39.712
The best.

38:40.610 --> 38:40.809
What?

38:41.213 --> 38:43.250
You're the best.

38:44.063 --> 38:46.798
Thanks, but, uh, I'm not eligible to play,

38:47.050 --> 38:48.535
so learn to jump-hook.

38:49.049 --> 38:50.532
It'll impress the Hell out of Lisa.

38:52.502 --> 38:53.532
You know, he's right, Sam.

38:53.853 --> 38:57.487
A good jump-hook can melt a woman's heart.

38:58.323 --> 38:59.461
Just ask Bill Walton.

39:00.397 --> 39:01.565
Lisa's gonna marry No Nose.

39:01.565 --> 39:03.395
No Nose? Never.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.510
No, you're right, Sam.

39:05.886 --> 39:07.570
They get married in about a year,

39:07.570 --> 39:09.961
they have a couple of kids, and then, uh,

39:09.961 --> 39:11.115
oh, they get a divorce.

39:15.957 --> 39:17.718
Look, listen...come here.

39:19.611 --> 39:21.061
Stick your left arm in his face when you

39:21.061 --> 39:22.000
jump to hold him off.

39:23.996 --> 39:25.256
You gotta beat Bentleyville tomorrow.

39:27.495 --> 39:28.843
Revenge, little brother.

39:30.208 --> 39:30.615
Revenge?

39:31.522 --> 39:32.732
Yeah, don't you remember?

39:33.732 --> 39:34.976
Uh, no, not really.

39:35.303 --> 39:36.914
Come on. In my face.

39:37.521 --> 39:39.957
When I played for Elkridge,

39:39.957 --> 39:41.709
Bentleyville was the only team we didn't beat.

39:42.465 --> 39:47.349
Yeah, right. Give me the ball.

39:50.741 --> 39:54.694
Hey, Tom, how bad do you want this revenge?

39:55.538 --> 39:56.216
What?

39:56.216 --> 39:57.433
Would you be willing to trade for it?

39:57.433 --> 39:58.719
Sam...

39:59.431 --> 40:01.216
You dork. Don't you want to win?

40:01.901 --> 40:02.610
Just give me one day.

40:03.243 --> 40:04.122
A day?

40:05.875 --> 40:06.866
The 8th of April.

40:07.608 --> 40:08.941
The day Tom was killed.

40:09.253 --> 40:10.364
How do I give you a day?

40:10.880 --> 40:12.000
By doing what I ask.

40:12.289 --> 40:13.002
Which is?

40:13.002 --> 40:14.534
Find the deepest hole you can find

40:14.534 --> 40:16.269
and crawl into it for 24 hours.

40:16.508 --> 40:17.348
Oh, Sam...

40:17.583 --> 40:18.332
Come on.

40:18.332 --> 40:19.945
Don't start this again.

40:20.395 --> 40:21.230
He's right, Sam.

40:22.744 --> 40:25.459
Look, I'll win the game, I swear I will,

40:27.106 --> 40:30.438
you just give me...April the 8th.

40:32.050 --> 40:33.039
Oh, what the Hell.

40:34.010 --> 40:37.215
You beat Bentleyville tomorrow and 
on April the 8th,

40:37.645 --> 40:40.327
I will crawl into the deepest, thicest,

40:40.327 --> 40:42.067
concrete bunker in Vietnam.

40:42.352 --> 40:44.073
All right?

40:49.547 --> 40:54.096
OK. Hoo-yah!

41:04.976 --> 41:08.662
Defense! Defense! Not patty cake, defense!

41:08.955 --> 41:10.729
Patty cake? That's high fives!

41:10.729 --> 41:12.295
That's called a high five!

41:12.794 --> 41:14.008
And what are you yelling defense?

41:14.008 --> 41:16.165
You should be putting them into a press!

41:17.362 --> 41:19.472
I feel like Dennis Hopper in Hoosiers.

41:35.887 --> 41:37.009
Lucky shot, Sam. Lucky shot!

41:55.736 --> 41:56.588
Give him room, Sibby.

41:58.196 --> 42:01.975
Breathe, Sam. Deep...and slow.

42:01.975 --> 42:04.078
You just got the wind knocked out of you.

42:04.913 --> 42:06.133
I'm gonna kill that No Nose.

42:09.477 --> 42:10.663
Just kepp your promise.

42:13.884 --> 42:20.046
He's alright.

42:20.469 --> 42:21.724
Just win the game, all right?

42:21.949 --> 42:23.819
That a boy, Sam!

42:26.200 --> 42:27.855
You look a-a-a little shkay, Sam?

42:28.326 --> 42:31.202
Had the wind knocked out of him, yeah.

42:33.985 --> 42:34.710
Why the Hell's he talking to himself?

42:35.984 --> 42:36.963
I gotta win this game, Al.

42:37.264 --> 42:38.075
Game's over, Jerk.

42:39.694 --> 42:42.002
Don't listen to Sansabeak there,

42:42.002 --> 42:43.628
you got plenty of time.

42:43.628 --> 42:46.296
Now all you have to remember is 
that free throw shooting

42:46.296 --> 42:49.046
is 80% mental concentration.

42:49.046 --> 42:50.700
You just gotta think positively.

42:50.700 --> 42:52.883
You say to yourself,
 "I'm not gonna miss this free throw.

42:52.883 --> 42:54.507
I can't miss this free throw."

42:54.507 --> 42:56.176
All you have to do is concentrate.

42:56.176 --> 42:58.112
Concentrate on taking this little,
 tenny ball and

42:58.112 --> 43:00.016
putting it in this great, big hoop up there...

43:01.613 --> 43:03.127
would you go ahead and shoot?

43:04.434 --> 43:04.949
Thank you.

43:15.237 --> 43:17.296
He's alright, that's one.

43:27.198 --> 43:29.202
You gonna shoot or pose, wimp?

43:47.911 --> 43:49.294
so...we win by one.

43:49.633 --> 43:50.854
You gonna freeze the ball, wimp?

43:52.177 --> 43:53.826
Defense! Defense!

44:07.584 --> 44:09.020
You got 22 seconds, Sam.

44:17.826 --> 44:20.981
What are you waiting for? Shoot!

44:21.982 --> 44:24.898
Sam, shoot the ball.

44:26.897 --> 44:29.215
Come on, Sam, shoot. 
We're running out of time, Sam.

44:31.839 --> 44:32.808
Bye, Dad.

45:21.028 --> 45:22.142
Awesome!

45:24.245 --> 45:26.885
You did it, Sam! You changed history!

45:27.237 --> 45:29.277
You guys are going on to be state champs.

45:29.498 --> 45:32.593
Everything is working out 
just as Ziggy predicted.

45:33.124 --> 45:34.439
My brother--what about my brother, Tom?

45:35.463 --> 45:36.407
He's over there.

45:41.305 --> 45:41.997
Uh, Sam.

45:42.247 --> 45:43.259
Lisa doesn't marry No Nose!

45:43.925 --> 45:45.823
She doesn't marry you, either, but

45:45.823 --> 45:47.245
at least she doesn't marry No Nose

45:47.245 --> 45:48.747
and have a couple of bulldogs.

45:49.746 --> 45:50.729
What about Tom?

45:51.534 --> 45:52.924
Uh...it's coming up.

45:58.248 --> 45:59.969
I'm sorry, Sam.

46:00.979 --> 46:02.824
He's still killed in Vietnam.

46:04.287 --> 46:11.454
Sam! Hoo-yah! All right, little brother!

46:44.731 --> 46:45.534
Tom?

46:48.427 --> 46:49.222
He's dead.

46:50.236 --> 46:50.627
Magic-

46:51.525 --> 46:51.673
Tom.

46:52.385 --> 46:53.796
How'd you know they were there?

46:55.523 --> 46:57.001
Oh, boy.

46:58.305 --> 47:04.712
