00:30.865 --> 00:32.898
  - Look Mom, it's a plane.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.266
  - Oh yeah, it is a plane.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.001
     - What are those
     things on the bottom?

00:36.003 --> 00:37.202
  - So it can land on water.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.237
         - Like a duck?

00:38.239 --> 00:39.838
     - Yeah, like a duck.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.673
    Wait, can you hear that?

00:41.675 --> 00:43.008
         It's quacking.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.011
 Quack, quack, quack, quack.

00:52.453 --> 00:55.320
        (child cheering)

01:00.361 --> 01:01.960
         - Do it again!

01:01.962 --> 01:05.297
     - Oh wow, you are such
     an adrenaline junkie.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.366
     I'm gonna have to
     keep my eye on you.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.870
     - Hello, old person.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.908
     - Quinn, sweetie
     you can't say that.

01:15.910 --> 01:16.842
         I'm so sorry.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.778
 - Oh no, it's okay, I am old.

01:21.015 --> 01:23.148
  And how do you do, ma'am?

01:23.150 --> 01:24.917
     - How do I do what?

01:24.919 --> 01:27.019
 - [Mom] He means, how are you?

01:27.021 --> 01:28.454
             - Oh.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.622
     Me and my mom are
     shopping for cereal.

01:30.624 --> 01:31.824
     - Isn't that funny?

01:31.826 --> 01:33.258
          I am too.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.660
 - What's your favorite kind?

01:34.662 --> 01:37.763
  - Oatmeal, not as colorful
  as some, but I enjoy it.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.231
  What's your favorite kind?

01:39.233 --> 01:41.066
      - I can't have any
      of my favorites.

01:41.068 --> 01:43.769
 - Oh surely you must get a
 treat every once in a while.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.637
 - Oh we wish we could, right?

01:46.807 --> 01:50.109
     - Well, maybe you
     should try oatmeal.

01:50.111 --> 01:50.943
         - Is it good?

01:50.945 --> 01:51.910
     - It's good for you.

01:51.912 --> 01:54.346
     - Can we get oatmeal?

01:54.348 --> 01:56.148
     - You might be the
     first five-year-old

01:56.150 --> 01:57.683
    in history to ask that.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.085
 - Well, it's been a
 pleasure meeting you ladies.

02:00.087 --> 02:01.186
            Walter.

02:01.188 --> 02:03.956
     - My name's Quinn,
     and this is my Mom.

02:03.958 --> 02:04.756
          - Lizzie.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.225
         - A pleasure.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.960
     Hope she comes out
     of her shell one day.

02:07.962 --> 02:09.561
     - Tell me about it.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.231
     Well have a nice day.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.165
         - You, too.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.270
 - Are you ready for takeoff?

02:30.451 --> 02:32.451
    - Huh, you feel normal.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.721
     - My mother always
     told me I'm special.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.922
     - You drive ambulances
     for a living,

02:36.924 --> 02:39.091
     and you couldn't
     find a thermometer?

02:39.093 --> 02:40.893
      - What, and miss a
      chance to see you?

02:41.829 --> 02:43.328
  - Lizzie has a strict rule

02:43.330 --> 02:45.898
     about mixing work and
     her personal life.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.332
         I'm still new.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.800
 Let me ease her into the idea

02:48.802 --> 02:50.969
     of me dating someone
     from the hospital.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.612
         - Excuse me.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.314
  Hi, you work here, right?

03:02.316 --> 03:03.916
     - Last I checked,
     how can I help you?

03:03.918 --> 03:07.319
 - I'm Charley Allen, I
 hear you need an EMS pilot.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.487
  - Oh right, the interview,

03:08.489 --> 03:11.190
     I'm Felicia Page,
     deputy administrator.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.324
         This is Todd.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.692
     - Todd, how you doing?
     - Hi, Todd.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.360
Your interview's not till 9:30.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.662
     - Well you know, early
     birds and all of that.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.897
     - Right, well, Lizzie
     Beauman's our COO,

03:18.899 --> 03:20.065
    and she'll be conducting
    your interview,

03:20.067 --> 03:22.534
but I don't think she'll be
able to get to you before then.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.902
  - I can keep myself busy.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.171
 If you're looking for me,
 I'll be up on the heli-pad.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.606
 - Wait, you can't just go--

03:27.608 --> 03:28.907
 - Oh, I'm sure I'll find it.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.842
     Upstairs until I
     see the sky, right?

03:35.883 --> 03:37.149
      - Remember we have
      piano practice

03:37.151 --> 03:38.884
at Nana's this afternoon, okay?

03:38.886 --> 03:39.685
            - Okay.

03:39.687 --> 03:40.619
         - Turn please.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.855
     All right, all right.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.858
     Okay, there you go.

03:48.162 --> 03:49.795
     I love you so much.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.862
        - Love you too.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.600
         - Bye Sweetie.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.040
         Good morning.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.342
      - Morning, Lizzie.

04:03.344 --> 04:06.078
 The invoice for the incubators
 came in over budget.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.479
          - Pay it.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.281
  - I don't know if the
  board's gonna go for that.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.716
     - Well, ask them
     next to the nursery.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.852
 They can't say no next to
 a bunch of adorable babies.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.422
 - You miss being an OB-GYN.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.558
      - I help more as
      an administrator.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.593
      - Okay, I just
      noticed you hadn't

04:21.595 --> 04:23.695
      let your medical
      license lapse, so.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.798
     Doctor Kapoor is back
     from vacation today.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.634
     - Great, what else?

04:28.636 --> 04:30.068
    - Doctor Stadler called.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.105
      Saint Carmen's is
      in the running.

04:33.107 --> 04:34.039
  Her patient's in Georgia,

04:34.041 --> 04:36.308
     and she doesn't want
     risk too much travel.

04:37.011 --> 04:38.176
 - See if she can have lunch.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.579
    - Already booked, Monday
    at Collins Quarter.

04:40.581 --> 04:41.880
         - Look at you.

04:43.117 --> 04:45.284
    A patient asked for a
    consult in the OB wing.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.485
        - Felicia.
        - I know you're

04:46.487 --> 04:47.719
 staying out of patient care,

04:47.721 --> 04:49.354
      but they asked for
      you specifically.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.190
            - Fine.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.927
  There was something else.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.297
     Oh, the interview for
     the new EMS pilot.

04:58.299 --> 04:59.598
 - Oh yeah, I met him earlier.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.465
         - He's here?

05:00.467 --> 05:01.900
His interview's not until 9:30.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.369
 - I know, he seems very eager.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.271
    He said he'd be waiting
    for you on the heli-pad.

05:06.273 --> 05:08.173
    - Well, he is not
    supposed to be up there.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.474
      - I would have
      tried to stop him,

05:09.476 --> 05:12.144
    but there's no way he's
    getting past Marcus.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.245
         - Good point.

05:13.247 --> 05:14.446
     - I went over his
     resume this morning.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.815
    He's the best candidate
    we've had by miles.

05:16.817 --> 05:21.386
- Well, he'll have every
opportunity to impress, at 9:30.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.860
     Good morning, Miss?

05:30.397 --> 05:31.296
         - Hey, sis.

05:34.268 --> 05:35.734
  - What are you doing here?

05:35.736 --> 05:36.935
 - I wanted to see a doctor.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.170
     - You have a doctor.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.371
 - Fine, I wanted to see you.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.239
    - And I want you to have
    the best care possible,

05:41.241 --> 05:44.142
    which is why I referred
    you to Doctor Crawford.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.378
     - Doctor Crawford's
     not my sister.

05:47.281 --> 05:48.113
            - Okay.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.216
     Is everything okay?

05:51.218 --> 05:52.351
     Are you feeling fine?

05:52.353 --> 05:53.752
      - No, yeah, it's
      nothing like that,

05:53.754 --> 05:56.288
    just I'm due in 10 days,

05:56.290 --> 05:59.057
     and I was hoping you
     could say something

05:59.059 --> 06:01.993
    to just make me, I
    don't know, less scared?

06:01.995 --> 06:06.231
  - It is perfectly normal
  to feel scared, we all do.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.132
         - Okay good.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.334
 - And when this gets going,

06:09.336 --> 06:12.204
     feel free to take
     your husband's hand,

06:12.206 --> 06:13.905
      and squeeze it as
      hard as possible,

06:13.907 --> 06:17.008
      because it is our
      right as mothers.

06:17.010 --> 06:17.943
         - Thank you.

06:20.314 --> 06:21.713
  - So just because I'm
  not gonna be your doctor,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.014
      doesn't mean I'm
      not gonna be there

06:23.016 --> 06:24.349
     every step of the way.

06:24.351 --> 06:27.719
 You are in great hands,
 Doctor Crawford is the best.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.620
            - Right.

06:29.890 --> 06:33.625
 (bright instrumental music)

06:34.862 --> 06:37.596
 - So that actually happened.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.465
    - This isn't much pad
    for a chopper that size.

06:40.467 --> 06:41.867
 - If you need help bringing
 her down, let me know,

06:41.869 --> 06:43.001
         I don't mind.

06:43.003 --> 06:43.869
     - Come on, you throw
     down a postage stamp,

06:43.871 --> 06:45.337
    I'll find a way to land.

06:45.339 --> 06:46.271
        - Charles Allen?

06:47.241 --> 06:49.274
     - Yeah, you can call
     me Charley, though.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.611
    - Nice meeting you man.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.012
     - Marcus, it was
     great talking to you,

06:54.014 --> 06:55.280
  and I hope I can trust
  you as a flight controller

06:55.282 --> 06:56.448
     a lot more than I can
     trust these stories

06:56.450 --> 06:57.516
 you're throwing around here.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.884
  - You should be so lucky.

06:59.987 --> 07:00.886
        I like this guy.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.722
  - He seems very qualified.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.689
      - Yeah, that too.

07:09.062 --> 07:09.995
        - Looking good?

07:11.231 --> 07:12.798
            - What?

07:12.800 --> 07:13.832
      - The helicopter.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.066
         - Oh, yeah.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.469
     Propellers look good,
     struts are steady.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.404
        Dials are clean.

07:19.406 --> 07:22.107
     - Great, glad it's
     up to your standards.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.210
 Why don't we head downstairs
 and conduct the interview?

07:25.212 --> 07:27.045
     - Why don't we do the
     interview up here?

07:27.047 --> 07:28.447
     Enjoy some sunshine.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.649
  - I think it would be more
  professional in my office.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.819
 - Oh come on, everybody can
 use a little more fresh air.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.053
    - I don't like heights.

07:35.055 --> 07:35.987
  - Okay, well in that case,

07:35.989 --> 07:37.355
 why don't you just hire me,

07:37.357 --> 07:39.257
 and we can skip this whole
 interview thing altogether.

07:40.394 --> 07:43.428
  - I can't hire you without
  doing an interview.

07:43.430 --> 07:44.362
     - Well I was kidding,

07:44.364 --> 07:45.831
    though I don't know what
    an interview tells you

07:45.833 --> 07:47.299
     about how I can fly.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.900
- Questions are mostly routine.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.068
  - I'm not big on routine.

07:50.070 --> 07:53.104
     - It's a hospital,
     routine saves lives.

07:53.106 --> 07:57.509
    - People save lives,
    routine saves lawsuits.

08:01.215 --> 08:03.281
     - It's nice meeting
     you, Mister Allen.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.218
            - Wait.

08:08.055 --> 08:08.954
        Are you serious?

08:09.690 --> 08:10.755
 I promise you a better pilot

08:10.757 --> 08:12.424
will not walk through that door.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.603
  - [Lizzie] He's a cowboy.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.538
     A hospital is no
     place for a cowboy.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.806
 - He has tons of experience,

08:27.808 --> 08:29.074
    all his certifications,

08:29.076 --> 08:31.576
he even flew two tours in Iraq.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.278
        - He's military?

08:34.248 --> 08:35.380
 - If we want Doctor Stadler

08:35.381 --> 08:37.549
    to choose Saint Carmen's
    for her procedure,

08:37.551 --> 08:38.683
    we have to have a pilot,

08:38.684 --> 08:40.784
     even if it's just for
     the next few weeks.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.421
     - Fine, bring him
     in for an interview,

08:43.423 --> 08:45.924
  and maybe he'll make a
  better second impression.

08:54.601 --> 08:55.734
             Hi.

08:55.736 --> 08:56.635
            - Mommy!

09:02.376 --> 09:03.675
  - Did you have a good day?

09:03.677 --> 09:04.709
             - Yes.

09:04.711 --> 09:05.710
     - Okay, why don't you
     get your backpack?

09:05.712 --> 09:07.412
We're gonna be late for Nana's.

09:07.414 --> 09:08.680
            - Okay.
            - Okay.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.852
      (soft piano music)

09:16.557 --> 09:17.489
        - [Quinn] Nana!

09:17.491 --> 09:18.423
          - Quinnie!

09:19.626 --> 09:22.193
Hello, my little prized student.

09:23.497 --> 09:25.430
 So, have you been practicing?

09:25.432 --> 09:26.631
             - Yes.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.867
 - Good, you go get warmed up
 and I'll be right there, okay?

09:30.804 --> 09:31.703
          - Hey Mom.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.441
    - Quinn is just getting
    better and better.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.577
  Can't wait for our recital
  in a couple of weeks.

09:38.579 --> 09:39.811
Our duet's gonna steal the show.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.347
    - How do you feel about
    sharing your spotlight?

09:43.317 --> 09:45.183
      - Well if one must
      pass the torch,

09:45.185 --> 09:47.185
      least it be to my
      own granddaughter.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.161
             What?

09:57.331 --> 09:58.229
        Everything okay?

09:59.199 --> 10:01.266
     - Have you heard
     anything about Quinn

10:01.268 --> 10:03.702
 having trouble making friends?

10:03.704 --> 10:04.903
            - Quinn?
            - Yeah.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.205
 - No, I can't imagine that.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.306
         - I know, but,

10:09.242 --> 10:11.242
    she was working on this
    thing, a little book,

10:11.244 --> 10:12.911
 and on the cover she wrote,

10:12.913 --> 10:14.846
    mission: find a friend?

10:16.216 --> 10:17.749
     - If you want I'll
     do a little fishing.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.118
  - No, I don't think I was
  supposed to know about it.

10:20.120 --> 10:20.986
            I just,

10:22.889 --> 10:25.290
     I've been working
     so many hours and--

10:25.292 --> 10:27.626
     - Don't even start.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.494
  You are a terrific mother.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.263
 And don't feel bad about
 being a little snoopy either,

10:32.265 --> 10:33.832
      'cause that's what
      we mothers do.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.700
     - Okay, good to know.

10:35.702 --> 10:36.601
         - Yes it is.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.776
     - And after all the
     customers were gone,

10:44.778 --> 10:48.480
     the Prince turned to
     the Cobbler and said,

10:48.482 --> 10:53.218
 "I think this is the start
 of a beautiful friendship."

10:54.788 --> 10:55.687
            The End.

10:56.590 --> 10:59.457
     - Can you read it one
     more time, please?

11:00.293 --> 11:01.793
 - It's a good one isn't it?

11:01.795 --> 11:06.097
  Yeah, it shows us that we
  can make friends anywhere.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.732
         - Like where?

11:07.734 --> 11:08.967
        - Like anywhere.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.705
     Like, at a day-care,

11:15.709 --> 11:17.509
     or a piano recital.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.010
         - A hospital?

11:19.012 --> 11:21.046
 - Well, hospitals are places

11:21.048 --> 11:24.716
 where people work very hard
 to make people feel better.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.551
    - But you said anywhere.

11:29.623 --> 11:31.856
 - Yes, and it's your bedtime.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.091
             Okay.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.726
      Let's go to sleep.

11:34.728 --> 11:37.662
 All right, let me tuck you in.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.634
 I love you very, very much.

11:43.570 --> 11:44.469
          Goodnight.

11:58.118 --> 11:58.950
        - Good morning.

11:58.952 --> 11:59.818
        - Good morning.

11:59.820 --> 12:00.952
  Can I get a coffee, black?

12:00.954 --> 12:02.687
     - Of course, and
     for you, young lady?

12:02.689 --> 12:04.589
     - I'll have chocolate
     milk, black.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.759
         - You got it.

12:07.761 --> 12:08.827
         - Thank you.

12:11.865 --> 12:12.731
  How's your chocolate milk?

12:12.733 --> 12:13.798
         - It's yummy.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.366
 - All right, want to trade?

12:15.368 --> 12:16.134
             - No.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.035
     - Can I have a sip?

12:17.037 --> 12:17.936
             - No.

12:17.938 --> 12:18.937
      - Let's sit here.

12:20.974 --> 12:21.840
          All right.

12:22.609 --> 12:23.641
     How is it, too hot?

12:26.546 --> 12:27.846
     - Hello, young person?

12:28.982 --> 12:30.115
          - Walter!

12:30.117 --> 12:31.649
     Mom, look it's Walter!

12:31.651 --> 12:32.851
         - It is, hi.

12:32.853 --> 12:33.818
         Good morning.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.687
      - It's me, Quinn.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.088
     - How could I forget?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.257
- Me and my Mom just got coffee.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.925
  - You're drinking coffee?

12:40.927 --> 12:42.894
 - Well, it's chocolate milk.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.629
  But I could drink coffee.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.664
Nana says I'm mature for my age.

12:47.501 --> 12:48.533
      - Without a doubt.

12:51.838 --> 12:53.438
     Elizabeth, wasn't it?

12:53.440 --> 12:54.539
          - Lizzie.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.807
  We come here all the time,

12:55.809 --> 12:57.609
surprised we've never seen you.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.911
     - I'm trying to get
     out of the house more.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.447
      I thought it could
      improve my mood

13:02.449 --> 13:04.716
    by reading my newspaper
    around people.

13:04.718 --> 13:05.850
     - How's that working?

13:05.852 --> 13:09.654
- It's nice, I see people drink
their first cup of coffee,

13:09.656 --> 13:11.890
    gathering their strength
    for another day.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.258
     - We like to read too.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.493
    Last night Mom read me
    the one about the prince

13:15.495 --> 13:17.796
 and the guy who makes shoes.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.264
 - The Prince and the Cobbler.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.598
      - You've read it?

13:20.600 --> 13:25.170
 - My wife, she read it to
 my son when he was your age.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.039
     It's a wonderful tale
     about finding friends

13:28.041 --> 13:30.141
 in the most unlikely places.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.611
  In my experience, they're
  the best kinds of friends.

13:34.548 --> 13:36.614
     - What kind of
     coffee did you get?

13:36.616 --> 13:38.249
     - Actually, it's tea.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.051
 - We should have a tea party!

13:40.053 --> 13:41.519
         Can we please?

13:41.521 --> 13:44.055
 - Since when do you drink tea?

13:44.057 --> 13:44.889
         - I love tea.

13:44.891 --> 13:45.790
          - You do?

13:47.761 --> 13:51.129
      Really, don't feel
      like you have to.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.897
      - No no, no no no.

13:52.899 --> 13:54.299
    First the cereal aisle,

13:54.301 --> 13:58.269
  and now of all the sleepy
  cafes I could have chosen,

13:59.840 --> 14:01.272
  it almost feels like fate.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.875
 If you would do me the honor,

14:03.877 --> 14:05.877
     I would love to
     host you at my house

14:05.879 --> 14:07.478
     on Saturday for tea.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.147
             - Yay.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.048
     You can come too, Mom.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.884
 - Oh well, you're five so yes,

14:12.886 --> 14:15.220
 I think I'll be coming too.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.421
      - All right then.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.322
         It's a date.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.827
 - [Charley] First off, let
 me apologize for yesterday.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.996
     - If I were upset
     you wouldn't be here.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.665
     You move around a lot.

14:27.667 --> 14:28.800
        - I am a pilot.

14:28.802 --> 14:31.002
     - Got most of your
     experience overseas.

14:31.004 --> 14:34.505
    - Do you mind if we
    pick up after that part?

14:37.277 --> 14:38.176
         - Of course.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.814
     After you got back,
     you flew in Vegas,

14:42.816 --> 14:45.116
  four jobs in eight months.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.418
 - I'm sure if you call, they
 will all sing my praises.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.788
 - I did call them, and they
 did all sing your praises.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.758
 Why so much bouncing around?

14:54.794 --> 14:55.960
        - I don't know.

14:55.962 --> 14:58.563
    A rolling stone
    gathers no moss, right?

14:58.565 --> 15:01.566
 - You know that's an argument
 against rolling stones?

15:01.568 --> 15:02.400
          - Really?

15:02.402 --> 15:04.168
Who wants to be covered in moss?

15:05.138 --> 15:06.571
      It wasn't that I
      wasn't committed.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.307
  It's just things out there
  work better, short-term.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.945
      - How did you end
      up in Savannah?

15:13.947 --> 15:14.946
      - I grew up here.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.849
      - I got back about
      four months ago.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.184
      I'm not sure how
      long I'll be here,

15:20.186 --> 15:23.288
 but while I'm around I thought
 I'd make myself useful.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.990
     - So you're not
     settled here, then?

15:25.992 --> 15:27.058
 - What do you mean by settled?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.660
         - Long term.

15:28.662 --> 15:29.560
         - Maybe not,

15:31.064 --> 15:33.665
      but I've learned
      the hard way that,

15:34.734 --> 15:37.568
     it's what you do today
     that's more important

15:37.570 --> 15:38.970
      than what you're
      gonna do tomorrow.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.572
    So if you hire me today,

15:42.475 --> 15:44.075
    I'll make a difference.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.251
            - Okay.

15:54.654 --> 15:55.687
     We'll bring you on,

15:56.589 --> 15:58.957
     for a two-week
     probationary period.

15:58.959 --> 16:02.260
 No reason for either of us to
 commit if it's not a good fit.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.095
          Long term.

16:05.865 --> 16:06.931
         - Thank you.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.003
  - [Message Voice] Hey this
  is Luke, leave a message.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.072
    - Hey Luke, it's Lizzie.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.741
 I just wanted you to know that

16:16.743 --> 16:19.978
     Quinn is having her
     first piano recital

16:19.980 --> 16:21.879
        on Mother's Day.

16:21.881 --> 16:26.117
    So if you were thinking
    of getting me anything.

16:28.054 --> 16:30.855
  I know you're busy, but it
  would mean a lot to her,

16:30.857 --> 16:31.856
      if you would come.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.292
    Let me know, okay, bye.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.228
          Hi there.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.429
      What's in the bag?

16:38.431 --> 16:40.898
     - They wanted to come
     to the tea party.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.267
 - Well of course, let's go.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.248
             Okay.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.218
         There he is.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.185
      - Welcome, ladies.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.253
        Good afternoon.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.122
      - Good afternoon.
      - Welcome.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.256
         - Thank you.

17:05.258 --> 17:08.059
      - Hi Quinn, you're
      looking lovely.

17:08.060 --> 17:08.826
         - Thank you.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.060
     - Step right this way.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.898
- [Lizzie] That is so beautiful.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.733
      - Why can't our
      house have a lake?

17:18.605 --> 17:19.837
        - Good question.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.175
 - And here you are, Mister?

17:26.311 --> 17:28.913
    Sorry, what's his name?

17:28.915 --> 17:29.981
            - Beary.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.082
            - Beary?

17:31.084 --> 17:32.884
     Went to school
     with a Clyde Berry,

17:32.886 --> 17:34.185
      ancestor of yours?

17:34.954 --> 17:37.488
     Your uncle, really?

17:37.490 --> 17:39.657
     How is the old card?

17:39.659 --> 17:41.659
      - Shall I tell him
      Beary's not real?

17:45.165 --> 17:46.030
            A piano!

17:49.135 --> 17:51.135
    - Hey Quinnie, you have
    to ask permission--

17:51.137 --> 17:53.538
 - No, no no, it's all right.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.541
     Those keys could use
     a little exercise.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.995
         - Very good.

18:17.997 --> 18:20.565
  - Me and Nana are doing a
  recital on Mother's Day.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.500
      - Wonderful, what
      are you playing?

18:22.502 --> 18:24.402
     - Heart and Soul,
     have you heard of it?

18:24.404 --> 18:25.369
 - It's one of my favorites.

18:25.371 --> 18:26.871
- Nana's playing the hard part.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.040
I'm just playing the easy part.

18:29.042 --> 18:30.608
      Would you like to
      help me practice?

18:30.610 --> 18:31.509
 - Well, I'm a little rusty,

18:31.511 --> 18:33.044
 but I'd love to hear you play.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.650
          (gasping)

18:39.652 --> 18:41.419
    - [Lizzie] What's that?

18:41.421 --> 18:43.921
     - [Quinn] Look Mom,
     it's a duck plane.

18:43.923 --> 18:44.822
            - It is.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.225
        - That's my son.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.262
      - I wanna go see.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.196
         - Quinn, wait!

18:54.868 --> 18:56.267
        Quinn, wait up.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.044
         Wait, is that?

19:07.046 --> 19:07.945
         - Hey, boss.

19:09.415 --> 19:14.452
             - Hi.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.805
     - Seems like I missed
     a real shindig.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.776
     - We had a tea party.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.444
         - A tea party?

19:40.446 --> 19:41.979
 Wow, what'd you talk about?

19:42.782 --> 19:44.048
        - This and that.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.149
      - This, and that.

19:45.151 --> 19:47.018
     Well, you've been
     more than generous.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.924
- Unfortunately, we have to go.

19:52.926 --> 19:53.791
             - Oh.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.293
 - I hope not on my account.

19:56.462 --> 19:59.263
  - Why don't you thank
  Walter for having us over?

19:59.265 --> 20:00.464
     - Thank you, Walter.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.433
      - The pleasure was
      all mine, my lady.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.368
     - Next time you can
     come to our house.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.970
 - I wait with baited breath.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.872
     - Thank you again,
     for having us over.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.607
        We're just gonna
        grab our things.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.841
      - Take your time.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.176
        - Okay, thanks.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.011
  - See you at the hospital.

20:14.013 --> 20:14.845
             - Yep.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.284
            - Yeah.

20:33.833 --> 20:39.070
    ♪ What the world needs
    now is love sweet love ♪

20:40.039 --> 20:42.340
      - Dad, some stuff
      you need to sign.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.576
It'll update your car insurance.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.979
 - I don't drive much anymore.

20:47.981 --> 20:49.580
 - Yeah, still need insurance.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.383
      - Why don't we
      just sell the car?

20:53.286 --> 20:54.518
     - We're not selling
     the car, Dad.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.053
 How else would you get around?

20:56.055 --> 20:58.389
      - She did all the
      driving, you know.

20:58.391 --> 20:59.290
          - I know.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.491
- Took a couple of jokes for it,

21:00.493 --> 21:02.426
      but she always was
      the better driver.

21:10.436 --> 21:13.404
 - Have you eaten anything
 since your tea party, today?

21:14.173 --> 21:16.307
  - Not feeling very hungry.

21:16.309 --> 21:17.708
 - I can make you something.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.045
         Come on Dad.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.114
        A few hours ago,

21:23.116 --> 21:24.448
     you were out there
     playing Downton Abbey

21:24.450 --> 21:25.683
      with a bunch of
      stuffed unicorns.

21:25.685 --> 21:26.984
      - You told me to
      be more sociable.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.953
 - Please help me understand.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.055
     Why will you talk
     to them, but not me?

21:33.259 --> 21:35.259
- There's nothing to understand.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.135
         - My mistake.

21:45.805 --> 21:49.607
 (introspective piano music)

23:25.438 --> 23:27.938
     - The second he came
     in, he acted so odd.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.740
- So he's protective of his dad.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.108
    - Are Quinn and I
    really that threatening?

23:31.110 --> 23:32.243
  - I like to think that all

23:32.245 --> 23:33.744
     of the Beauman women
     are intimidating.

23:34.981 --> 23:37.148
  Hey, do you think that you
  would have had more kids,

23:37.150 --> 23:38.916
if you and Luke stayed together?

23:39.852 --> 23:40.885
        - Probably not.

23:41.687 --> 23:43.020
     He traveled too much.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.322
    - I remember he had more
    clothes in his suitcase

23:45.324 --> 23:46.424
      than his dresser.

23:46.426 --> 23:49.794
     - Yeah, it wasn't
     just the traveling,

23:49.796 --> 23:52.763
    it was, he would breeze
    in for the easy stuff,

23:52.765 --> 23:56.033
     play the hero, and
     then breeze right out.

23:57.203 --> 24:00.004
  - Well, you definitely
  deserve better than that.

24:00.006 --> 24:00.905
         - Thank you.

24:05.378 --> 24:07.611
        - Hey, hey boss.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.615
    Hey, I want to talk to
    you about the other day.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.984
     - Well, you weren't
     exactly welcoming.

24:13.986 --> 24:16.921
     - I may have misread
     the situation.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.323
      - It was a little
      girl's tea party.

24:19.325 --> 24:21.292
  What was there to misread?

24:21.294 --> 24:23.127
     - It's complicated,
     but what do you say

24:23.129 --> 24:24.462
 you and I bury the hatchet,

24:24.464 --> 24:27.431
 and we'll arrange Walter
 and Quinn another play date.

24:27.433 --> 24:31.836
 - I'd say it's best to keep
 our relationship professional.

24:31.838 --> 24:32.937
          Thank you.

24:32.939 --> 24:35.439
     - All right, I was a
     little bit of a jerk.

24:35.441 --> 24:36.807
     - Good, we both agree.

24:38.144 --> 24:41.312
      Now, this is when
      you tell me why.

24:44.350 --> 24:45.749
  - My Mom passed last year,

24:45.751 --> 24:49.153
  and things with my Dad
  and I have not been easy.

24:51.324 --> 24:52.356
  - I'm really really sorry.

24:52.358 --> 24:53.924
 - When I saw him with Quinn,

24:56.162 --> 24:58.462
     for just a second, I
     saw the old Walter,

24:58.464 --> 25:01.165
      and, this is gonna
      sound ridiculous,

25:02.735 --> 25:04.502
      but I was jealous.

25:06.973 --> 25:09.473
     - If it helps, Quinn
     is a very good sharer.

25:11.978 --> 25:12.843
            - Good.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.480
     I've gotta tell you,

25:16.482 --> 25:19.183
      when you guys left
      the other day,

25:19.185 --> 25:20.985
      my Dad went and
      sat at the piano.

25:20.987 --> 25:23.254
     He used to play for
     my Mom, all the time.

25:24.257 --> 25:26.190
But he doesn't do that anymore.

25:26.192 --> 25:29.026
     - So he hasn't played
     since your Mom?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.494
 - No, he hasn't touched it.

25:33.165 --> 25:35.366
     - Quinn is taking
     lessons from my Mom,

25:35.368 --> 25:37.835
  and she just, she saw the
  piano and got excited,

25:37.837 --> 25:40.371
     and I'm so sorry
     if it made him feel

25:40.373 --> 25:41.472
  uncomfortable in any way.

25:41.474 --> 25:43.874
 - No, no no no, the opposite.

25:44.844 --> 25:47.945
     I think Quinn had
     some effect on him.

25:50.716 --> 25:55.386
 - So I saw a book that Quinn
 was making in day-care,

25:57.189 --> 25:59.056
    mission: find a friend.

26:00.493 --> 26:03.160
         Yeah, I know.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.762
      I didn't read it,

26:04.764 --> 26:06.196
 but whatever her mission is,

26:06.198 --> 26:09.700
    I think your Dad has
    something to do with it.

26:12.204 --> 26:13.003
             - So?

26:13.005 --> 26:16.340
 - So, I will talk to Quinn,

26:16.342 --> 26:18.242
    and we'll figure it out.

26:19.812 --> 26:20.945
     - Awesome, thank you.

26:20.947 --> 26:23.747
 - Yeah well, sounds like
 they both could use a friend.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.083
        - Can't we all?

26:29.088 --> 26:30.254
        - See you later.

26:35.227 --> 26:38.028
 As you'll see, on the dossier,

26:38.030 --> 26:40.831
     Saint Carmen's has
     up-to-date facilities.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.399
     - You have a pilot?

26:42.401 --> 26:46.103
     - Yes, we have an EMS
     pilot on the staff.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.871
      He has all of his
      certifications.

26:47.873 --> 26:50.941
  - He has experience flying
  tissue for transplants?

26:50.943 --> 26:53.444
      - He actually, he
      worked overseas.

26:54.614 --> 26:56.447
         So, I mean--

26:56.449 --> 26:58.015
      - Doctor Beauman,
      I have no doubt

26:58.017 --> 26:59.583
that you have a lovely hospital,

26:59.585 --> 27:03.420
 but for my procedure I don't
 need, up-to-date and amazing,

27:03.422 --> 27:05.456
      I need cutting
      edge, and perfect.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.225
      Well it was very
      nice meeting you.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.527
    When I make my decision
    I'll let you know.

27:12.064 --> 27:13.097
        Doctor Stadler?

27:15.167 --> 27:16.066
            Please.

27:18.504 --> 27:19.903
 There may be other hospitals

27:19.905 --> 27:22.039
 with more advanced procedures,

27:22.041 --> 27:23.607
    bigger research grants.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.978
     But I know, that
     we have 42 doctors,

27:27.980 --> 27:31.949
     98 nurses, 13 lab
     techs, six custodians,

27:31.951 --> 27:34.385
     and yes, one very
     well-qualified pilot,

27:34.387 --> 27:35.819
  who will bend time itself

27:36.989 --> 27:39.823
    to make sure that your
    procedure is a success.

27:41.093 --> 27:45.262
  Now, ask me what the other
  hospitals don't have.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.332
         - What else?

27:48.334 --> 27:49.600
     - They don't have me.

27:50.569 --> 27:53.737
     I won't let so much
     as a thermostat

27:53.739 --> 27:56.607
 be at the wrong temperature
 when it comes time

27:56.609 --> 27:58.008
     for your operation.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.912
      - Well, leadership
      is very important.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.983
     I'll take that into
     consideration when
     I make my decision.

28:05.985 --> 28:06.850
  Thank you, Doctor Beauman.

28:06.852 --> 28:07.785
         - Thank you.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.785
  - What are you doing Dad?

28:41.787 --> 28:43.754
      - I signed those
      papers you needed.

28:43.756 --> 28:45.856
     The car insurance,
     a couple of others.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.393
     Hope you don't mind I
     didn't read them all.

28:49.395 --> 28:50.294
          - Thanks.

28:52.965 --> 28:55.032
     I can't believe you
     kept all of that.

28:56.202 --> 28:59.303
  - We used to have so much
  fun playing after church.

29:01.607 --> 29:02.906
        - Yeah, we did.

29:04.009 --> 29:06.844
 - Lizzie called, she invited
 us over to their house.

29:06.846 --> 29:09.379
  I thought I'd teach Quinn
  how to play croquet.

29:11.684 --> 29:13.751
- That sounds like a great idea.

29:14.687 --> 29:16.787
     - I understand if you
     don't want to come.

29:16.789 --> 29:20.357
 It's not always fun seeing
 your boss in a social setting.

29:20.359 --> 29:21.725
 - What are you talking about?

29:21.727 --> 29:22.793
     I wouldn't miss it.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.812
     - Good job, let's go.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.751
 - I can't tell you how great
 it is to see him like this.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.453
     It's the old Walter.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.389
- Well, having young kids visit
assisted living facilities

29:52.391 --> 29:56.226
  has been found to improve
  mood, cognitive function,

29:56.228 --> 29:57.361
        even life span.

29:59.532 --> 30:00.798
      - Maybe it's that.

30:03.669 --> 30:05.836
- Oh, I knocked the wicket over.

30:06.806 --> 30:08.705
     - By the way, who's
     Doctor Stadler?

30:09.842 --> 30:11.642
      - How did you find
      out about her?

30:12.411 --> 30:13.610
 - I keep my ear to the ground.

30:13.612 --> 30:14.778
 Sounds like she's a big deal.

30:14.780 --> 30:17.447
 - Yeah, yeah, she's amazing.

30:17.449 --> 30:20.684
 She developed this procedure
 for kidney transplants,

30:20.686 --> 30:23.020
  cuts recovery time by 80%,

30:23.022 --> 30:25.989
     makes rejection risks
     almost non-existent.

30:25.991 --> 30:29.893
If her procedure is successful,
the grant money alone.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.930
     - Yeah, nothing in
     a hospital's cheap.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.998
        - No, it isn't.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.466
     It's not just that.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.403
When I became an administrator,

30:39.405 --> 30:42.172
     it was my dream to
     build a housing wing

30:42.174 --> 30:43.907
    for patients' families.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.344
  The money she'd bring in
  would make that possible.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.547
         Who's winning?

30:50.549 --> 30:51.615
        - I don't know.

30:51.617 --> 30:52.482
     - Well you'd better
     figure it out.

30:52.484 --> 30:53.417
     Winner gets lemonade.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.052
    - What's the loser get?

30:55.054 --> 30:58.622
    - Lemonade, so the
    stakes are pretty high.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.357
- Tell Charley he's invited too.

31:03.229 --> 31:07.331
     - You are also
     invited for lemonade.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.199
- Well, who could pass that up?

31:14.473 --> 31:15.939
     That little girl
     had you on the run.

31:15.941 --> 31:19.576
 - My heart hasn't hit that
 many BPM's in a few decades.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.278
     - Use it or lose it
     though, right Doc?

31:21.280 --> 31:24.314
  - I try not to weigh in on
  friends' medical issues.

31:24.316 --> 31:25.515
             Here.

31:25.517 --> 31:26.350
     - [Walter] Thank you.

31:26.352 --> 31:27.551
      - Are you serious?

31:27.553 --> 31:29.920
 - Yeah, well in medicine it's
 important to stay objective

31:29.922 --> 31:31.588
     and if you know the
     patient personally--

31:31.590 --> 31:34.391
     - That must be our
     little Beethoven now.

31:38.364 --> 31:39.563
     - I was just kidding.

31:47.039 --> 31:47.871
         (whistling)

31:47.873 --> 31:48.939
         Pretty good.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.476
 - I still need more practice.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.311
 - Sounds pretty good to me.

31:54.313 --> 31:55.212
            - Yeah.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.148
     - How about you play
     something for us, Dad?

31:59.718 --> 32:01.618
- If you don't feel comfortable.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.621
 - Come on, you know the other
 half of Heart and Soul, right?

32:06.058 --> 32:07.291
    - It's been a long time.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.426
  - It's not been that long.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.494
         - It's fine.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.562
     - Nobody wants to
     hear me play anyway.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.998
 But if you like, I'll listen.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.168
Maybe I can offer some pointers.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.905
        (piano playing)

32:23.475 --> 32:24.942
     - Look if he doesn't
     feel comfortable,

32:24.944 --> 32:26.343
     he does not have to.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.645
  - You haven't been living
  with this, like I have.

32:28.647 --> 32:31.081
    If I didn't push him,
    he wouldn't do anything.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.182
     It's for his own good.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.650
        - He's grieving.

32:33.652 --> 32:36.186
    And that's just a
    process that takes time.

32:37.489 --> 32:40.457
  - Yeah, but a little pain
  now, for a lot less later?

32:40.459 --> 32:42.092
I'd want to be treated that way.

32:42.094 --> 32:44.428
      - Have you thought
      about getting him

32:44.430 --> 32:45.896
    some professional help,

32:45.898 --> 32:48.231
    someone who's not so
    close to the situation.

32:48.233 --> 32:49.700
 - I've been down that road.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.269
Professional help, close or not,

32:53.072 --> 32:54.705
 the real question is always,

32:54.707 --> 32:56.440
      are they putting
      the patient first?

32:56.442 --> 32:57.474
      Like family would?

33:02.614 --> 33:06.016
     I'm just gonna get
     some more lemonade.

33:21.000 --> 33:21.965
          Hey Pops.

33:24.536 --> 33:25.469
         - Long day.

33:27.406 --> 33:28.238
            - Yeah.

33:29.441 --> 33:32.042
  I snuck a nap in the
  on-call room after shift.

33:32.044 --> 33:33.076
        - Smart choice?

33:36.215 --> 33:39.016
 - Look I know you don't
 want to talk about this but,

33:41.353 --> 33:43.687
 we need to come up with a plan

33:44.656 --> 33:45.722
      about Mom's ashes.

33:49.895 --> 33:51.828
     - I didn't know you
     were in such a hurry.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.463
    - It's been over a year.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.599
  It's something she
  wanted us to do together.

33:57.236 --> 33:59.536
    Dad, I have dropped
    everything in my life--

33:59.538 --> 34:01.104
     - I didn't ask you to.

34:04.476 --> 34:05.876
  - Look, I know it's hard.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.112
 But this isn't just for me.

34:10.783 --> 34:11.782
      It's for you, too.

34:19.091 --> 34:20.590
     - Lizzie and Quinn
     asked me to come over

34:20.592 --> 34:23.860
 and make cupcakes for
 Quinn's rehearsal tomorrow.

34:23.862 --> 34:26.696
  Quinn asked if you'd come
  to, if you're interested.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.533
    - Yeah, it sounds good.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.741
         - 500 degrees?

34:37.743 --> 34:38.909
      - Is that too hot?

34:38.911 --> 34:40.643
      - Not if you're
      making briquettes.

34:41.914 --> 34:44.047
      - I told you I was
      no good at this,

34:44.049 --> 34:47.317
 but all the kids at Quinn's
 rehearsal are gonna thank you.

34:47.319 --> 34:48.318
      - Yes, they would.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.252
  When I was in high school,

34:49.254 --> 34:51.188
    Lizzie made brownies for
    my field hockey team,

34:51.190 --> 34:52.922
 and we used them as eye black.

34:54.359 --> 34:56.960
  - Thank you for the
  eggs, and the commentary.

34:56.962 --> 34:58.128
 - Like I would miss the chance

34:58.130 --> 34:59.629
     to meet the famous
     Walter and Charley?

34:59.631 --> 35:01.998
     - Oh, infamous really.

35:02.000 --> 35:02.799
            Walter.

35:02.801 --> 35:03.600
          - Barbara.

35:03.602 --> 35:04.468
     You must be fly-boy.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.303
     - Yeah, or Charley.

35:06.305 --> 35:07.938
     You must be the
     baker in the family?

35:07.940 --> 35:09.840
     - That's right, but
     there's not a lot

35:09.842 --> 35:11.641
      of competition in
      that department.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.910
     - Mommy, it came off.

35:15.114 --> 35:16.913
  - Stay right there, I'm
  gonna wash my hands, okay?

35:16.915 --> 35:18.748
     - I got it, I got it.

35:19.485 --> 35:22.152
    What do you have there?

35:22.154 --> 35:23.019
            Oh yeah.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.089
         Easy peazy.

35:26.091 --> 35:28.925
    Now, you gotta be
    honest with me, though.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.861
  Is that where you get all
  your superpowers from?

35:30.863 --> 35:32.329
 - I don't have superpowers.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.164
     - What? Are you sure?

35:34.166 --> 35:35.532
  You could have fooled me.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.101
         - Thank you.

35:38.103 --> 35:39.102
         - Of course.

35:39.104 --> 35:40.971
      - Look, all fixed.

35:49.014 --> 35:51.781
        (phone ringing)

35:53.051 --> 35:54.117
  - This is Doctor Beauman.

35:54.119 --> 35:56.286
    - Hello, this is
    Doctor Stadler calling.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.088
     - Hi, Doctor Stadler.

35:58.090 --> 36:00.323
     - I just finished my
     meeting at Sky Valley.

36:00.325 --> 36:03.260
     - Sky Valley, that's
     one of the best

36:03.262 --> 36:04.728
  hospitals in the country.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.630
      - It is, but they
      just didn't make

36:06.632 --> 36:08.465
 the same impression you made.

36:08.467 --> 36:09.299
             - Oh?

36:09.301 --> 36:10.667
 - If your offer still stands,

36:10.669 --> 36:12.903
 I'd love to perform my new
 procedure at your hospital.

36:15.774 --> 36:16.873
        Doctor Beauman?

36:18.210 --> 36:19.609
             - Yes,

36:19.611 --> 36:22.479
 yes, the offer still stands.

36:22.481 --> 36:24.447
     It would be our
     pleasure to have you.

36:24.449 --> 36:26.550
  - Great, you'll be
  hearing from my team soon.

36:26.552 --> 36:29.452
 I trust you'll start
 prepping things on your side?

36:29.454 --> 36:31.988
- To be honest, we already have.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.623
      - Figured as much.

36:33.625 --> 36:34.724
          Talk soon.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.860
      - Yes we will,
      thank you so much.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.974
  - Okay, you hear that one?

36:50.976 --> 36:51.975
      - It's a warbler.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.144
         - Pretty good.

36:54.146 --> 36:55.345
     But what color is it?

36:55.347 --> 36:57.113
      - Black and white.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.081
      - That's amazing.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.551
    - But you spend as much
    time in the air as I do,

37:01.553 --> 37:03.486
     you make friends
     with the neighbors.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.825
          (grunting)

37:08.827 --> 37:10.527
     - Well, duty calls.

37:10.529 --> 37:11.728
        See you tonight?

37:11.730 --> 37:12.529
            - Okay.

37:12.531 --> 37:13.330
         - All right.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.431
             - Bye.
             - Bye.

37:19.271 --> 37:20.737
 - He seems like a great guy.

37:20.739 --> 37:21.871
         - Yeah, he is.

37:23.242 --> 37:24.608
    I think he wants to make
    things more serious.

37:24.610 --> 37:27.210
        - Oh, all right,
        congratulations.

37:27.212 --> 37:28.144
          - Thanks.

37:28.146 --> 37:31.147
     I still haven't told
     Lizzie about us, yet.

37:31.149 --> 37:32.649
          - Why not?

37:32.651 --> 37:34.317
     - Lizzie's always
     been so adamant about

37:34.319 --> 37:36.686
  not mixing home and work.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.255
      - Really, she has?

37:38.257 --> 37:39.356
         - Big time.

37:39.358 --> 37:41.391
    She leaves the grounds
    to take personal calls.

37:41.393 --> 37:43.760
     She won't even deliver
     her own sister's baby.

37:43.762 --> 37:44.995
      I don't know what
      she'd say about me

37:44.997 --> 37:46.930
      dating somebody
      from the hospital.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.198
             - Hi.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.566
  I've been looking for you.

37:49.568 --> 37:50.700
         - What's up?

37:50.702 --> 37:52.102
    - Doctor Stadler called.

37:52.104 --> 37:54.471
    She chose Saint Carmen's
    for the procedure.

37:55.240 --> 37:56.740
      - That's amazing.

37:56.742 --> 37:57.641
          - I know.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.542
          - Lizzie!

38:00.279 --> 38:01.311
         - Congrats.

38:03.115 --> 38:05.248
     - It's very exciting
     for the hospital.

38:05.250 --> 38:07.817
  Oh she needs the serial
  number for the helicopter

38:07.819 --> 38:08.785
      for her paperwork.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.354
    - Okay, I don't know it
    off the top of my head,

38:11.356 --> 38:14.591
  but if you want to come
  up with me, we can get it.

38:14.593 --> 38:17.761
 - It's okay, you can just get
 it and run it by my office.

38:17.763 --> 38:20.297
  - Oh, that's right,
  you're afraid of heights.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.833
- Afraid is a very strong word.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.569
  - Well why don't you just
  come up there with me,

38:26.571 --> 38:28.838
  and then you'll know where
  to find it next time.

38:32.277 --> 38:36.012
         Three, tango,

38:36.014 --> 38:39.316
        foxtrot, fiber.

38:39.318 --> 38:40.183
     - Got it, thank you.

38:40.185 --> 38:41.284
      - Hey, slow down.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.187
     You've been up, right?

38:44.189 --> 38:45.055
             - No,

38:45.057 --> 38:46.122
        it's fine by me.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.491
    - There is nothing
    dangerous about flying,

38:48.493 --> 38:49.392
     especially with me.

38:49.394 --> 38:50.527
  - Well I'll have you know,

38:50.529 --> 38:53.196
    that acrophobia is very
    normal, and common.

38:54.166 --> 38:55.832
      - There's nothing
      common about you.

38:56.868 --> 38:58.668
      Come on, let's
      take a quick spin.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.371
 - It's the middle of the day.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.107
    What if a call comes in?

39:08.280 --> 39:09.512
          - Marcus?

39:09.514 --> 39:11.214
    - Go for flight control.

39:11.216 --> 39:13.450
     - Hey, I want to take
     Doctor Beauman up for

39:13.452 --> 39:15.618
     no more than an
     hour, are we clear?

39:15.620 --> 39:18.388
- All good, Allentown is
double staffed, they can cover.

39:20.926 --> 39:21.891
      - Says we're good.

39:23.628 --> 39:26.730
 Listen, anytime that you go,
 and you get uncomfortable,

39:26.732 --> 39:28.198
 we'll come right back down.

39:29.768 --> 39:30.633
          I promise.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.842
 Right in front, there you go.

39:38.844 --> 39:39.709
        Can you hear me?

39:39.711 --> 39:42.145
 - Yeah, yeah, I can hear you.

39:42.147 --> 39:43.546
  - You don't have to yell,

39:44.449 --> 39:45.715
  I don't have a crash cart,

39:45.717 --> 39:47.851
     so I'm gonna need
     you to breathe, okay?

39:48.987 --> 39:50.954
  - If my phone rings,
  will I be able to hear it

39:50.956 --> 39:52.722
     over the propeller?

39:52.724 --> 39:53.590
             - No.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.975
     You really should
     look out the window.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.343
 You're missing all the fun.

40:13.345 --> 40:15.078
      - Having a lot of
      fun, thank you.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.549
      - That's my Dad's
      house over there.

40:21.219 --> 40:22.285
     Don't you wanna see?

40:29.661 --> 40:33.196
  - Yep, I think I prefer
  the view from the ground.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.838
     - Can't wait to
     take you skydiving.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.773
     - I thought you said
     one step at a time?

40:43.775 --> 40:45.942
     - Actually I'm partial
     to giant leaps.

40:45.944 --> 40:46.943
        - I've noticed.

40:49.014 --> 40:52.749
  (light instrumental music)

40:57.689 --> 40:59.255
     What are you doing?

40:59.257 --> 41:00.657
 - I'm gonna bring her down.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.358
     - You're gonna
     land it down there?

41:02.360 --> 41:04.928
 - Lizzie, I have over 2,000
 hours of flight experience,

41:04.930 --> 41:08.665
  and I've landed in tighter
  spots than open meadow.

41:10.402 --> 41:12.068
 But if you really aren't
 comfortable with me landing,

41:12.070 --> 41:14.337
      I can take us back
      to the hospital.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.583
     Gives you a different
     perspective, right?

41:26.585 --> 41:27.917
             - Huh?

41:27.919 --> 41:29.385
     - Flying like that.

41:29.387 --> 41:32.522
 - Oh yeah, well, literally.

41:34.392 --> 41:35.592
  - Look what Quinn gave me.

41:35.594 --> 41:36.860
     - I gave her those.

41:37.796 --> 41:39.195
      She re-gifted me.

41:40.131 --> 41:42.532
    - Well, I will not let
    her kindness be wasted.

41:50.675 --> 41:52.008
     How was her rehearsal?

41:52.010 --> 41:52.775
            - Great.

41:52.777 --> 41:53.610
            - Yeah?

41:53.612 --> 41:54.611
- Yeah, the cupcakes were a hit,

41:54.613 --> 41:56.212
 thanks to you and your Dad.

41:57.582 --> 41:59.516
 She was very excited to share.

42:01.353 --> 42:02.886
    Always been very giving.

42:04.856 --> 42:08.091
  I guess every parent says
  that about their kid.

42:08.093 --> 42:09.726
        - Yeah, they do.

42:09.728 --> 42:11.194
    But Quinn is different.

42:12.230 --> 42:13.696
 She's a pretty special kid.

42:14.766 --> 42:15.665
            - Yeah.

42:17.736 --> 42:19.002
      When she got sick,

42:20.772 --> 42:22.472
  I thought it was the flu.

42:22.474 --> 42:24.807
    I thought, I'm a doctor.

42:25.544 --> 42:27.210
I know what the flu looks like.

42:29.648 --> 42:30.713
And when she didn't get better,

42:30.715 --> 42:33.182
     I finally took her in.

42:33.184 --> 42:35.184
 Her blood sugar levels were,

42:38.023 --> 42:39.022
        almost lost her.

42:41.059 --> 42:42.625
     - People make
     mistakes, you can't--

42:42.627 --> 42:45.461
 - No, I couldn't be objective.

42:46.565 --> 42:49.098
 Would I have made that mistake
 with someone else's kid?

42:50.569 --> 42:54.103
  Just, between her Dad
  leaving, and the insulin,

42:56.408 --> 42:59.442
  she's had to deal with so
  much adult stuff already.

43:02.314 --> 43:03.413
         It's not fair.

43:05.717 --> 43:06.616
        - No, it's not.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.352
     It's not fair, at all.

43:12.424 --> 43:14.223
     My Mom passed while
     I was deployed,

43:14.225 --> 43:19.429
     and I just needed to
     be somewhere else.

43:20.832 --> 43:22.799
      - I can't imagine
      how hard that was.

43:25.837 --> 43:28.071
 - You know in Alaska they have

43:28.073 --> 43:29.405
     all these little towns

43:29.407 --> 43:30.773
  that are completely
  surrounded by wilderness.

43:30.775 --> 43:33.276
     No roads, and I've
     got this buddy, Paul,

43:33.278 --> 43:35.011
     who flies in supplies,

43:35.013 --> 43:37.113
     he's got this squad
     of bush pilots.

43:38.083 --> 43:39.816
      - Sounds isolated.

43:39.818 --> 43:41.451
  - Actually, the opposite.

43:43.722 --> 43:46.656
    It's funny no matter how
    far apart people get,

43:46.658 --> 43:51.728
      they still find
      a way to connect.

43:54.099 --> 43:55.331
    - I know what you mean.

43:58.303 --> 43:59.469
     - I know that you do.

44:02.440 --> 44:06.075
 You know what, I want to show
 you something, come here.

44:18.456 --> 44:19.489
         - You okay?

44:20.825 --> 44:21.691
            - Yeah.

44:25.063 --> 44:27.130
      My Mom and Dad
      used to come here.

44:38.209 --> 44:39.575
See, it wasn't that bad, right?

44:39.577 --> 44:40.343
            Flying?

44:40.345 --> 44:41.210
    - I was only petrified,

44:41.212 --> 44:42.078
         half the time.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.413
            - Half?

44:43.415 --> 44:44.347
          Progress.

44:44.349 --> 44:47.250
     - Well, you may have
     had a calming effect.

44:47.252 --> 44:49.886
    - Well, human Dramamine,

44:49.888 --> 44:50.920
        at your service.

44:52.157 --> 44:53.089
          - Oh look.

44:54.959 --> 44:55.925
     - [Charley] You used
     to do this, right?

44:55.927 --> 44:57.427
  Didn't you deliver babies?

44:57.429 --> 44:59.595
      - Yep, every day.

44:59.597 --> 45:01.597
      - You know, if you
      loved it so much,

45:01.599 --> 45:03.232
     how come you became
     an administrator?

45:03.234 --> 45:06.235
     - As an OB, I was on
     call, all the time.

45:06.237 --> 45:08.471
     And when Quinn's Dad
     and I got divorced,

45:08.473 --> 45:11.340
 I went to the board and asked
 to be moved to administration,

45:11.342 --> 45:13.076
     so I could spend
     more time with her,

45:13.078 --> 45:16.112
  and still do what I love.

45:19.284 --> 45:20.883
 - Quinn is lucky to have you.

45:23.254 --> 45:24.821
          - Thanks.

45:24.823 --> 45:25.855
         It's funny,

45:27.826 --> 45:29.959
    I've never been
    nervous for a delivery,

45:29.961 --> 45:31.227
     but with my sister,

45:33.198 --> 45:35.064
    if I was her doctor and
    something went wrong,

45:35.066 --> 45:37.900
     I would never be able
     to forgive myself.

45:37.902 --> 45:40.236
 - It's a risk she's willing
 to take though, right?

45:41.573 --> 45:42.872
         Ah, I know.

45:43.608 --> 45:45.441
      Home and hospital,

45:45.443 --> 45:46.976
  never the two shall meet.

45:57.021 --> 45:58.254
          Found 'em.

45:58.256 --> 45:59.455
     - Oh, where were they?

45:59.457 --> 46:00.723
        - Laundry room.

46:00.725 --> 46:02.091
     - Oh yeah, thank you.

46:03.294 --> 46:04.460
- What's you got going on here?

46:04.462 --> 46:05.995
     - I thought I'd give
     Quinn some pointers

46:05.997 --> 46:07.630
    on reading sheet music.

46:07.632 --> 46:08.965
 - That's a nice thing to do.

46:08.967 --> 46:10.233
      - I'm enjoying it.

46:10.235 --> 46:11.501
        Marks on paper,

46:11.503 --> 46:14.604
    yet carry more meaning,

46:15.707 --> 46:18.274
 than can be expressed by
 all the words in the world.

46:24.883 --> 46:27.583
     - I took Lizzie up in
     the helicopter today.

46:27.585 --> 46:29.619
     - I thought she was
     afraid of heights.

46:30.655 --> 46:31.821
- There's not much she can't do

46:31.823 --> 46:33.422
 when she puts her mind to it.

46:36.394 --> 46:37.960
 I took her out to your spot,

46:39.564 --> 46:41.297
the one you used to take Mom to.

46:45.370 --> 46:47.904
     - Beautiful view
     of the water there.

46:47.906 --> 46:48.805
         - Yeah it is.

46:54.179 --> 46:55.378
     I miss her too, Dad.

47:11.329 --> 47:12.829
             - Hey.
             - Hey.

47:12.831 --> 47:15.898
 - You're helping Doctor
 Stadler get settled in okay?

47:15.900 --> 47:18.668
 - Actually there's been a
 small hiccup on that front.

47:18.670 --> 47:19.735
            - What?

47:19.737 --> 47:21.404
    - Well, we don't have an
    EMS pilot after today.

47:21.406 --> 47:23.272
     - What about Charley?

47:23.274 --> 47:24.874
         - You forgot?

47:24.876 --> 47:25.808
         - Forgot what?

47:26.911 --> 47:30.847
 Oh, today's the last day
 of his probationary period.

47:32.383 --> 47:33.883
- He is off today, I could go--

47:33.885 --> 47:35.985
- No no no, I'll go talk to him.

47:35.987 --> 47:36.853
            Thanks.

47:37.755 --> 47:40.756
      (knocking on door)

47:44.596 --> 47:45.461
             - Hi.

47:45.463 --> 47:46.362
         - Come on in.

47:52.737 --> 47:53.870
      - What's all this?

47:54.806 --> 47:56.339
        - Well, my Mom,

47:57.475 --> 48:00.376
  she used to do all the
  bookkeeping, so to speak.

48:00.378 --> 48:02.678
    So she was the signatory
    on their paperwork,

48:02.680 --> 48:05.281
    and when my Dad wouldn't
    return their calls,

48:05.283 --> 48:06.549
    they started calling me.

48:07.952 --> 48:10.319
- And that's why you came home.

48:10.321 --> 48:11.254
          - Partly.

48:11.256 --> 48:12.421
 I got most of this worked out.

48:12.423 --> 48:13.623
And there's this one other thing

48:13.625 --> 48:16.525
     that my Dad and I
     have to do together,

48:16.527 --> 48:18.895
    but I don't think he's
    quite ready for it yet.

48:18.897 --> 48:23.833
     - Okay, so when you're
     done with all of that,

48:23.835 --> 48:24.734
          then what?

48:25.870 --> 48:28.704
- I don't know, there's not
much keeping me here, is there?

48:33.745 --> 48:34.911
     - What if you stayed?

48:36.147 --> 48:37.647
     A little bit longer?

48:37.649 --> 48:42.051
 Look, I know, I know I forgot

48:42.053 --> 48:43.686
about your probationary period,

48:43.688 --> 48:46.722
      and we really need
      a pilot on staff.

48:46.724 --> 48:48.724
 - But I've never been
 anyone's long-term solution--

48:48.726 --> 48:51.193
    - Or Doctor Stadler goes
    to another hospital.

48:53.064 --> 48:56.265
    And it seems like your
    Dad is still struggling.

48:57.201 --> 48:58.567
     I'm sure it's nice to
     have family around.

48:58.569 --> 49:00.336
     - Honestly, I think
     he'd just rather

49:00.338 --> 49:01.938
 hang out with you and Quinn.

49:01.940 --> 49:03.572
      I think I just
      make things worse.

49:03.574 --> 49:04.674
     - That is not true.

49:05.877 --> 49:09.378
  - So, you only want me to
  stay for Doctor Stadler?

49:10.148 --> 49:11.047
          That's it?

49:13.051 --> 49:14.450
    - Just a few more days,

49:15.486 --> 49:17.420
     till we're done
     with the procedure.

49:20.625 --> 49:22.792
        - Okay boss, you
        can count on me.

49:23.728 --> 49:24.627
         - Thank you.

49:28.166 --> 49:29.699
 I'll let you get back to it.

49:37.442 --> 49:39.241
     I have an operating
     room on standby.

49:39.243 --> 49:40.943
     As soon as the tissue
     becomes available,

49:40.945 --> 49:42.144
     the theater is yours.

49:42.146 --> 49:43.279
      - And my patient?

49:43.281 --> 49:44.380
        - Arrived today.

49:44.382 --> 49:46.615
     He's in a room just
     next to the OR.

49:46.617 --> 49:48.117
     - You're the pilot?

49:48.119 --> 49:49.051
          - Guilty.

49:49.053 --> 49:50.386
        - You understand
        what's at stake?

49:50.388 --> 49:51.821
- Charley is more than capable--

49:51.823 --> 49:54.423
  - I have flown evacs from
  hot zones, touch and goes,

49:54.425 --> 49:56.826
  invasive maneuvers through
  anti-aircraft fire,

49:56.828 --> 49:58.594
    I'm pretty familiar
    with high-stakes flying.

49:58.596 --> 50:00.496
  - For my procedure,
  we'll have a tight window

50:00.498 --> 50:02.198
      for the tissue to
      still be viable.

50:02.200 --> 50:03.232
     Every second counts.

50:03.234 --> 50:04.166
    - When the call comes in

50:04.168 --> 50:06.335
     I will be airborne in
     under five minutes.

50:06.337 --> 50:08.471
     - There's a storm
     coming, high winds.

50:08.473 --> 50:11.040
  Our helicopter's already
  a little big for our pad.

50:11.042 --> 50:12.641
- And if it's too windy to land?

50:12.643 --> 50:15.511
     - We have a backup
     hangar 20 miles away.

50:15.513 --> 50:17.179
  - 20 miles, city traffic,

50:17.181 --> 50:19.081
     that's another 30
     minutes, maybe more.

50:19.083 --> 50:20.683
     - Won't be an issue.

50:20.685 --> 50:21.851
     I'll land on the pad.

50:25.123 --> 50:25.988
         - You sure?

50:27.025 --> 50:28.357
         - Yes ma'am.

50:28.359 --> 50:29.725
  - Okay, well if you don't
  make it back in time,

50:29.727 --> 50:31.427
 we'll do a normal transplant.

50:31.429 --> 50:33.996
  It's taken months to find
  a suitable candidate.

50:33.998 --> 50:36.098
  I won't risk the
  reputation of my procedure

50:36.100 --> 50:38.067
 if conditions are not perfect.

50:38.069 --> 50:39.001
         - Understood.

50:39.971 --> 50:40.870
         - Copy that.

50:44.175 --> 50:45.608
     Cheers, by the way.

50:47.078 --> 50:48.644
 - What are we cheers-ing to?

50:48.646 --> 50:51.480
  - To Saint Carmen's being
  HQ for that fancy pants

50:51.482 --> 50:54.116
Doctor Stadler's new operation.

50:54.118 --> 50:57.486
    - Well, she hasn't
    done the operation yet.

50:57.488 --> 50:58.788
        - What's wrong?

50:58.790 --> 51:00.523
  You have such a hard time
  letting yourself by happy.

51:04.062 --> 51:07.063
 - I've had a lot of practice
 managing expectations.

51:07.932 --> 51:10.132
     - See, I hate that.

51:11.302 --> 51:13.502
  You shouldn't have to
  manage your expectations.

51:14.772 --> 51:16.238
You deserve everything you want.

51:17.909 --> 51:19.241
         - Thank you.

51:19.243 --> 51:20.142
         - Of course.

51:21.446 --> 51:23.579
     - My friend up in
     Alaska gave me a call.

51:24.682 --> 51:26.415
 He has an opening for a pilot.

51:26.417 --> 51:27.249
             - Oh.

51:29.787 --> 51:31.120
        Congratulations.

51:31.122 --> 51:34.890
      I mean it's what
      you wanted, right?

51:36.694 --> 51:38.194
 - Yeah, it's what I wanted.

51:40.865 --> 51:44.867
  - But you'll stay
  through the surgery then?

51:45.736 --> 51:47.369
         - Of course.

51:47.371 --> 51:48.437
        - Great, great.

51:51.876 --> 51:52.675
          - Lizzie?

51:52.677 --> 51:54.977
     - No, hey, it's fine.

51:54.979 --> 51:59.048
  Like you said, you're no
  one's long-term solution.

52:00.518 --> 52:01.650
      After the surgery,

52:01.652 --> 52:03.385
we'll look for your replacement.

52:04.589 --> 52:05.454
             Bye.

52:12.530 --> 52:16.198
      (thunder rumbling)

52:16.200 --> 52:19.235
      (soft piano music)

52:20.204 --> 52:21.403
     - Weather's coming in.

52:22.507 --> 52:24.206
     I need to clean those
     gutters tomorrow.

52:24.208 --> 52:26.942
 - Mom, please let somebody
 help you with that, this time.

52:26.944 --> 52:29.912
  - Stop, these knees may be
  getting a little creaky,

52:29.914 --> 52:31.780
     but I can still climb
     an eight-foot ladder,

52:31.782 --> 52:33.149
     thank you very much.

52:34.986 --> 52:37.119
        Okay, what's up?

52:37.855 --> 52:38.954
 - I think Charley's leaving

52:38.956 --> 52:41.190
     after Doctor
     Stadler's procedure.

52:41.192 --> 52:42.124
         - Oh, Lizzie.

52:44.362 --> 52:45.427
          I'm sorry.

52:45.429 --> 52:46.896
         - No, it's,

52:48.232 --> 52:49.431
     it's kind of expected.

52:49.433 --> 52:53.802
     It's just Quinn has
     really taken to him.

52:53.804 --> 52:54.670
             - And?

52:56.107 --> 52:57.173
         - And what?

52:57.175 --> 52:59.008
      - And maybe you're
      a little taken

52:59.010 --> 53:01.944
     with the dashing
     young pilot, yourself?

53:01.946 --> 53:04.113
        Just, a little?

53:07.952 --> 53:09.218
    - Why didn't you remarry

53:09.220 --> 53:11.120
after you and Dad got divorced?

53:11.989 --> 53:13.322
  - Where'd that come from?

53:13.324 --> 53:16.325
     - I mean was it,
     life was too hectic?

53:16.327 --> 53:17.927
     Was it me and Barb?

53:19.163 --> 53:21.297
        - I just waited.

53:23.601 --> 53:26.302
      And I just didn't
      look that hard.

53:29.640 --> 53:31.373
Why are you asking me that, now?

53:34.111 --> 53:35.010
            - Luke,

53:37.114 --> 53:38.380
     I know he loved me,

53:40.084 --> 53:44.086
     and I know he loves
     Quinn so much,

53:44.088 --> 53:45.688
but he was always moving around,

53:45.690 --> 53:49.525
 and he was never there when
 we needed him the most.

53:49.527 --> 53:51.760
 - Wait, you're not regretting
 you got divorced, are you?

53:51.762 --> 53:54.063
 - No no no, nothing like that.

53:56.567 --> 53:59.702
    It's just, with Charley.

54:01.105 --> 54:02.171
            - Yeah?

54:02.173 --> 54:05.174
     - With Charley I
     see that same fear,

54:05.176 --> 54:06.642
      of standing still.

54:07.678 --> 54:08.844
         And I wonder,

54:10.982 --> 54:14.516
 I just don't want to bring
 another man into Quinn's life,

54:15.886 --> 54:17.219
    who's gonna leave again.

54:18.356 --> 54:23.092
 - Sweetheart, don't let fear
 keep you from being happy.

54:27.932 --> 54:28.931
         - Okay Mom.

54:35.139 --> 54:36.272
     All right, Sweetie.

54:36.274 --> 54:37.206
        It's your turn.

54:52.857 --> 54:55.024
         - 25 points.

54:55.026 --> 54:56.225
         Nicely done.

54:57.361 --> 55:01.330
 - Hey, you have your piano
 recital coming up, don't you?

55:01.332 --> 55:02.631
            - Mhmm.

55:02.633 --> 55:03.666
      - Are you nervous?

55:03.668 --> 55:04.733
        - A little bit.

55:04.735 --> 55:05.701
     - Oh you have nothing
     to worry about,

55:05.703 --> 55:07.136
  you're going to be great.

55:08.906 --> 55:11.573
        (phone buzzing)

55:11.575 --> 55:13.809
 - Sorry, I gotta take this.

55:16.247 --> 55:17.379
         Hey Felicia.

55:17.381 --> 55:19.248
     - Don't worry,
     she's gonna be okay.

55:19.250 --> 55:20.416
     - Who's gonna be okay?

55:20.418 --> 55:22.017
      - I assumed she
      called you first.

55:22.019 --> 55:23.252
 - What are you talking about?

55:23.254 --> 55:25.721
     - Your Mom, she's in
     the emergency room.

55:25.723 --> 55:26.622
            - What?

55:36.600 --> 55:37.599
            - Oh no.

55:37.601 --> 55:40.035
     - Mom, what happened,
     are you okay?

55:41.939 --> 55:43.238
      - No parent should
      ever have to hear

55:43.240 --> 55:45.040
their child say, I told you so.

55:46.577 --> 55:47.843
  - You cleaned the gutters.

55:47.845 --> 55:49.812
    - That ladder is not
    as sturdy as you think.

55:49.814 --> 55:51.146
        - Is it broken?

55:51.148 --> 55:51.980
     - The ladder's fine.

55:51.982 --> 55:53.649
      - Your hand, Mom.

55:55.720 --> 55:58.787
     - I think they called
     it a radar fracture.

55:58.789 --> 56:00.155
     - A radius fracture.

56:00.157 --> 56:01.557
         - I'm fine.

56:01.559 --> 56:03.525
     But what this means
     is that I can't play

56:03.527 --> 56:05.027
    in Quinn's recital now.

56:08.799 --> 56:10.199
  I'm just so mad at myself.

56:10.201 --> 56:12.634
  - No, no no no, look, the
  most important thing is

56:12.636 --> 56:14.236
      that you are okay.

56:15.639 --> 56:18.907
 - Fold this over, like that,

56:19.977 --> 56:22.845
    and this over like that,

56:22.847 --> 56:26.281
      and voila, you've
      got an airplane.

56:26.283 --> 56:27.082
             - Wow.

56:27.084 --> 56:28.016
         - Chuck it.

56:29.387 --> 56:30.319
          - It flew.

56:30.321 --> 56:31.320
 - You know what, my Dad and I

56:31.322 --> 56:32.788
used to make these all the time,

56:32.790 --> 56:35.324
     and if you catch
     the wind just right,

56:35.326 --> 56:36.959
     they will fly forever.

56:36.961 --> 56:37.960
  - Let's make another one.

56:37.962 --> 56:39.395
 - Let's do this, great idea.

56:39.397 --> 56:40.529
         Now remember.

56:40.531 --> 56:42.865
    - Well, she was cleaning
    out her gutters,

56:42.867 --> 56:44.600
 and she fell off the ladder,

56:45.336 --> 56:47.236
    and she broke her wrist.

56:47.238 --> 56:48.036
            - Oh no.

56:48.038 --> 56:48.837
          - I know.

56:48.839 --> 56:50.172
    - Is she gonna be okay?

56:50.174 --> 56:52.341
- She is going to be just fine.

56:53.878 --> 56:59.181
 But, she's not gonna be able
 to play your piano recital.

56:59.850 --> 57:01.650
 I know, Sweetie I'm so sorry.

57:01.652 --> 57:03.952
 I know how hard you practiced.

57:04.722 --> 57:05.821
     - What about Walter?

57:05.823 --> 57:08.424
     He know Nana's
     part, he could play.

57:08.426 --> 57:09.558
    - Well, you know Walter

57:09.560 --> 57:11.360
     hasn't played the
     piano in a long time.

57:11.362 --> 57:13.228
 - You know what, he'll do it.

57:13.230 --> 57:14.062
          - Charley?

57:14.064 --> 57:15.097
      - No, he'll do it.

57:16.300 --> 57:17.433
        - There you are.

57:17.435 --> 57:19.234
     The call just came in,
     they found a kidney.

57:23.874 --> 57:27.276
 - The kidney's in Banford,
 that's a three-hour roundtrip.

57:27.278 --> 57:28.944
     - Three hours is
     pushing our timeline.

57:28.946 --> 57:30.112
    - By then, we'll be in
    the middle of a squall.

57:30.114 --> 57:33.382
 Our heli-pad's a tight fit,
 even in the best conditions.

57:35.219 --> 57:36.485
    - Just be ready for me.

57:39.356 --> 57:40.289
        - Hey, Charley.

57:43.027 --> 57:44.226
      Please be careful.

57:46.030 --> 57:49.331
 - Come on, this isn't half as
 dangerous as cleaning gutters.

58:00.044 --> 58:00.943
            - Quinn?

58:04.882 --> 58:05.781
          - Got ya!

58:05.783 --> 58:07.182
         - Oh, Luke.

58:07.184 --> 58:08.116
         - Hey Lizzie.

58:09.153 --> 58:10.085
        - Daddy's here.

58:10.087 --> 58:10.986
         - Well yeah,

58:12.590 --> 58:13.622
         I see that.

58:13.624 --> 58:14.823
 - I'm sorry for popping in,

58:14.825 --> 58:16.658
     but I just wanted
     it to be a surprise.

58:17.428 --> 58:19.161
    - Well you surprised me.

58:19.163 --> 58:20.729
    - Hey she said something
    happened to your Mom,

58:20.731 --> 58:21.563
     is everything okay?

58:21.565 --> 58:22.664
        - Oh, yeah yeah.

58:22.666 --> 58:24.366
     She's gonna be fine,
     thanks for asking.

58:24.368 --> 58:26.201
     - Good, I'd love to
     stick around and help,

58:26.203 --> 58:27.736
      but I have to go
      to Italy for work,

58:27.738 --> 58:29.972
and it's this last second thing.

58:29.974 --> 58:31.507
 I just came to say goodbye.

58:43.220 --> 58:45.387
  - [Marcus] Hey, that storm
  hasn't slowed down any.

58:45.389 --> 58:46.555
     You need to be quick.

58:47.691 --> 58:50.325
  - Yeah, well I'll flap
  my arms as fast as I can.

58:54.465 --> 58:57.900
      (Quinn squealing)

58:57.902 --> 58:58.834
      - Do you know how
      much I love you?

58:58.836 --> 58:59.935
         - How much?

58:59.937 --> 59:02.004
    - What is the biggest
    number you can think of?

59:02.006 --> 59:03.205
         - One hundred.

59:03.207 --> 59:06.341
 - Well I love you more than
 a hundred, hundred, hundreds.

59:08.679 --> 59:11.179
     - You're coming to my
     piano recital, right?

59:11.181 --> 59:12.080
         - I'll try.

59:12.850 --> 59:13.749
          I'll try.

59:17.354 --> 59:18.587
          - Hi Luke.

59:18.589 --> 59:19.755
     - Hey Felicia, right?

59:21.225 --> 59:22.457
 - Have we heard from Charley?

59:22.459 --> 59:24.159
- He just flew over Chatterton.

59:24.161 --> 59:25.694
    - What's he doing
    flying in this weather?

59:25.696 --> 59:27.329
    - Lizzie, if you'd like
    to take Quinn home,

59:27.331 --> 59:29.031
     I'm happy to hold down
     the fort for a while.

59:29.033 --> 59:32.034
  - Okay great, hey, you're
  gonna go with Felicia,

59:32.036 --> 59:34.202
  and I'm gonna talk to your
  Dad for a second, okay?

59:34.204 --> 59:35.037
         - Bye Sweetie.

59:35.039 --> 59:35.938
        - Come on kiddo.

59:39.476 --> 59:40.776
         - You'll try?

59:40.778 --> 59:41.543
             - Liz.

59:41.545 --> 59:42.744
    - She's five years old.

59:42.746 --> 59:45.347
     When you say you'll
     try, she believes you,

59:45.349 --> 59:47.149
    because she doesn't know
    you the way that I do.

59:47.151 --> 59:49.184
      - Liz, there'll
      be more recitals.

59:49.186 --> 59:50.719
     Okay, it'll work out.

59:50.721 --> 59:51.653
        - You know what,

59:51.655 --> 59:54.456
  it doesn't just work out.

59:54.458 --> 59:55.657
 Messes don't just disappear

59:55.659 --> 59:58.794
     because someone always
     has to clean them up.

59:58.796 --> 01:00:00.062
  - That's not what I meant.

01:00:00.064 --> 01:00:01.563
     - What did you mean?

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:11.740
     Quinn is taking a nap.

01:00:11.742 --> 01:00:14.009
      Thank you so much
      for watching her.

01:00:14.011 --> 01:00:16.044
 - Oh please, it's no problem.

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:17.212
 - Well, Charley's due in soon,

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:18.513
     so I have to get
     back to the hospital,

01:00:18.515 --> 01:00:19.881
but I'll be back to pick her up

01:00:19.883 --> 01:00:21.216
     as soon as we're done.

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:22.284
     - Long as you need.

01:00:23.087 --> 01:00:23.986
         - Thank you.

01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:29.591
    Guessing Quinn asked
    you to play the recital.

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:33.662
            Walter,

01:00:34.632 --> 01:00:35.897
     if you're not ready,

01:00:35.899 --> 01:00:40.268
     you don't have to,
     I will understand,
     Quinn will understand.

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:45.407
          It's okay.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:47.175
            Really.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.746
  - When I was a young man,

01:00:50.748 --> 01:00:53.415
     I used to play
     piano in an old bar.

01:00:54.852 --> 01:00:58.453
  One night, this beautiful
  woman comes floating in.

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:00.489
     Now I'm finishing up,

01:01:00.491 --> 01:01:02.991
    and she comes over and
    asks me to play a song.

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:07.095
    What the World Needs
    Now is Love Sweet Love.

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:12.768
 So I fat-fingered my way
 through what I could remember,

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:15.137
  and I'm sure I'm bombing.

01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:19.508
      And she asked me
      to play it again.

01:01:22.446 --> 01:01:25.280
     And again, and again.

01:01:28.652 --> 01:01:31.219
  And from then on whenever
  she asked, I played it.

01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:33.655
        At our wedding.

01:01:35.426 --> 01:01:38.460
     When Charley came home
     from the hospital.

01:01:45.703 --> 01:01:48.470
    Then, she asked me to
    play it at her funeral.

01:01:56.013 --> 01:01:59.081
 And for the first time, I
 didn't play it when she asked.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:09.691
 I'll play at Quinn's recital.

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:13.095
      You have my word.

01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:22.170

         - If Charley,

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:55.370
    when Charley gets back,

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:57.005
     Doctor Stadler's
     gonna be in surgery

01:02:57.007 --> 01:02:59.174
      for hours and then
      there's post-op.

01:02:59.176 --> 01:03:00.909
     - Everything's ready
     just like you asked.

01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:01.810
         - No, it's,

01:03:03.747 --> 01:03:06.114
     Quinn has her piano
     recital tomorrow,

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:09.284
 so I'm not gonna be able to
 oversee all of the post-op.

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:13.321
    So I'm counting on you.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.725
         You can do it.

01:03:16.727 --> 01:03:17.659

             - Hey.

01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:02.370
     - Wind's really
     starting to kick up.

01:04:02.372 --> 01:04:03.572
     - Is it safe to land?

01:04:03.574 --> 01:04:05.941
         - Safe? No.

01:04:05.943 --> 01:04:06.808
          Possible?

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:11.246
    - Could it put our
    other patients at risk?

01:04:11.248 --> 01:04:13.181
     - Helicopters
     don't crash pretty.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.683
  But I will tell you this,

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:17.752
 if I trust anybody to land
 in this mess, it's Charley.

01:04:20.824 --> 01:04:21.723
            - Okay.

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:24.926
         - Excuse me.

01:04:26.563 --> 01:04:28.797
  - Well, we're still on the
  timetable you set for us.

01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:30.065
    - Barely, but if he has
    to land at the hangar.

01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:32.500
     - Then we'll do a
     standard transplant.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:34.769
    The patient comes first.

01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:37.706
 I know you've waited a long
 time for a suitable candidate.

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:39.074
     - No, you're right.

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:42.611
     - [Charley] Flight
     control, do you copy?

01:04:42.613 --> 01:04:44.279
 - That's a go, flight control.

01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:46.047
     - Little soupy up
     here, flight control.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:48.250
- Soupy? More like clam chowder.

01:04:48.252 --> 01:04:50.085
 - I'm about two minutes out.

01:04:50.087 --> 01:04:51.219
     Am I clear to land?

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:52.287
- You sure about this, Charley?

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:53.955
     - Am I clear to land?

01:04:55.759 --> 01:04:56.858
     - What do you think?

01:04:57.995 --> 01:04:58.860
             - No.

01:05:08.939 --> 01:05:10.171
      - Tell him to land
      at the hangar.

01:05:10.173 --> 01:05:11.072
     - You do not have
     permission to land,

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:13.675
    I repeat, you do not
    have permission to land.

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:17.979
        - I can do this.

01:05:17.981 --> 01:05:19.881
      - Sorry Charley,
      look it's a no-go.

01:05:19.883 --> 01:05:21.116
      Unless you have
      a clear air path,

01:05:21.118 --> 01:05:22.317
     you have to land at
     the hangar, okay?

01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:24.252
     - I'm telling you,
     Marcus, I can do this.

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:25.153
          - Charley.

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:27.389
          - Charley?

01:05:28.926 --> 01:05:30.191
          - Lizzie?

01:05:30.193 --> 01:05:31.259
  - I know you want to pull
  through for us, okay,

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:32.460
 but I can't let you do this.

01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:33.628
 - No offense, boss, but I got

01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:34.796
     a lot more experience
     flying than you do.

01:05:34.798 --> 01:05:36.798
     - It's too dangerous.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.500
 - You let me worry about that.

01:05:38.502 --> 01:05:40.101
 - I'm in charge, it's my call,

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:43.138
     and I'm telling you
     to land at the hangar.

01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:48.443
 - I'm coming in for a landing.

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:49.778
            - What?

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:50.946
  - Have some white jackets
  here to take the package.

01:05:50.948 --> 01:05:53.515
  - Charley, do not do this.

01:05:54.685 --> 01:05:57.252
  - I'm gonna get off com,
  it's time to concentrate.

01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:18.506
     - There he is, there
     he is, there he is.

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:29.784
        - Hang in there,

01:06:29.786 --> 01:06:32.654
         hang in there.
         - This is bad.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:34.255
      Wait wait wait,
      what is he doing?

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:35.457
  - He's trying a new angle.

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:37.258
      - No, no, give me
      the radio again.

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.426
     - Unless you can
     talk him out of it,

01:06:38.428 --> 01:06:41.629
     all you're gonna
     do is distract him.

01:06:50.974 --> 01:06:52.173
         It's steeper.

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:53.074
             - Yes.

01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:30.678
    - I may have had better
    landings in my day,

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.147
 but I believe this is yours.

01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:33.748
     - Thanks, hope you're
     as good at groveling

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.250
     as you are at flying.

01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:36.951
     - What's that mean?

01:07:39.623 --> 01:07:40.955
          See that?

01:07:40.957 --> 01:07:41.856
          No sweat.

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:49.531
- That was one of the most
selfish things I have ever seen.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.734
- Well it wasn't exactly a
field of daisies for me either.

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:54.702
- I am responsible for the lives

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:57.005
     of every single person
     in this hospital.

01:07:57.007 --> 01:07:58.907
 - You don't have the
 experience to make that call.

01:07:58.909 --> 01:08:00.341
    - What if it would have
    spun out of control

01:08:00.343 --> 01:08:01.276
        and hit the side
        of the building?

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:04.546
    What if something would
    have happened to you?

01:08:04.548 --> 01:08:07.082
     You were thinking of
     no one but yourself.

01:08:07.084 --> 01:08:08.616
 - I was thinking about you.

01:08:11.955 --> 01:08:14.522
 I know how much this procedure
 means to the hospital,

01:08:14.524 --> 01:08:16.224
and how much this means to you.

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.627
     I knew I could land
     that helicopter.

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:21.662
      Was it dangerous?

01:08:21.665 --> 01:08:23.531
    Yeah, flying a
    helicopter's dangerous.

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:24.966
  But everything worked out.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:32.674
        - You're fired.

01:08:32.676 --> 01:08:33.575
          - Lizzie.

01:08:44.654 --> 01:08:47.589
 - Oh hey, I heard Doctor
 Stadler made it into surgery.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:50.091
            Lizzie?

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:57.365

  - Mommy, you weren't
  supposed to see that yet.

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:16.678
     - Oh Sweetie, I'm so
     sorry, I didn't know.

01:10:17.948 --> 01:10:18.813
          Come here.

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:28.890
    I want you to know

 to find Mom a friend, okay?

01:10:31.094 --> 01:10:33.995
  You should never ever ever
  have to worry about that.

01:10:35.999 --> 01:10:38.032
    - I know, I just wanted
    to get you something

01:10:38.034 --> 01:10:39.167
      for Mother's Day.

01:11:04.861 --> 01:11:05.793
          - Walter,

01:11:15.338 --> 01:11:16.638
        you old coward.

01:11:51.107 --> 01:11:53.875
  Maybe now that Lizzie's
  had a chance to cool down.

01:12:00.417 --> 01:12:02.083
  - I'm gonna be fine, Dad.

01:12:02.085 --> 01:12:04.118
    Don't you start
    worrying about me, now.

01:12:05.155 --> 01:12:08.456
 - All right, that is enough!

01:12:09.326 --> 01:12:10.725
  Once the funeral was over,

01:12:10.727 --> 01:12:12.894
    you barely stuck around
    for a cup of coffee

01:12:12.896 --> 01:12:14.395
     before you were off,

01:12:14.397 --> 01:12:17.699
  so I've heard quite
  enough about poor Charley

01:12:17.701 --> 01:12:21.636
 and everything he's sacrificed
 for his poor pitiful father.

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:23.871
         I've had it.

01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:28.042
     - You didn't tell me.

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:32.914
      You didn't tell me
      how sick she was.

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:34.215
         - We thought,

01:12:34.217 --> 01:12:38.219
     we thought, you had
     enough to worry about.

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:41.689
    - Enough to worry about?

01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:45.893
 I never got to say goodbye.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.767
    When I got back I
    wasn't in a good place.

01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:54.669
         I was angry,

01:12:56.106 --> 01:12:57.505
     specifically at you.

01:13:01.811 --> 01:13:04.312
     So I took some time
     to clear my head.

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:06.748
 Maybe that was a mistake but,

01:13:08.651 --> 01:13:09.684
         I'm here now.

01:13:13.223 --> 01:13:14.389
 I'm trying to make it right,

01:13:14.391 --> 01:13:16.858
 and all I'm asking is for
 you to meet me in the middle,

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.993
 and you can't even do that.

01:13:30.874 --> 01:13:32.807
 - Charley, I know I haven't

01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:34.876
      been there for you
      the way I should.

01:13:37.847 --> 01:13:39.881
 But every time I look at you,

01:13:41.284 --> 01:13:43.050
          I see her,

01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:50.191
  and it reminds me that
  she's gone all over again.

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:55.797
     - You lost your wife.

01:14:05.608 --> 01:14:06.574
      But I lost my Mom.

01:14:15.418 --> 01:14:16.350
        I lost her too.

01:14:23.593 --> 01:14:26.561
     - Charley, I'm sorry.

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:46.013
 - My tummy feels all funny.

01:14:46.015 --> 01:14:48.683
     - Well, there are a
     lot of people here.

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:51.252
    You just have some
    butterflies, that's all.

01:14:51.254 --> 01:14:52.320
         - Butterflies?

01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:55.556
     - Yeah, so that
     feeling in your tummy,

01:14:55.558 --> 01:14:58.326
     those are butterflies
     taking flight.

01:14:59.596 --> 01:15:01.229
        It happens when,

01:15:05.802 --> 01:15:09.070
     when you really care
     about something.

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.174
     You're gonna do great.

01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:14.075
            - Okay!

01:15:32.428 --> 01:15:35.730
     (audience applauding)

01:15:39.235 --> 01:15:40.368
        - Can we stall?

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:43.204
     - I wish, if he
     doesn't get here soon.

01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:44.472
    - Where's Walter, Mommy?

01:15:45.909 --> 01:15:47.041
          - I know.

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:48.276
     You sure you can't
     play with one hand?

01:15:48.278 --> 01:15:49.544
          - I wish.

01:15:49.546 --> 01:15:50.711
          Oh honey.

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:51.979
         - Okay, hi.

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:54.549
      Listen, I know
      that you practiced

01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:56.050
     really really really
     hard for this,

01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:57.251
      and I am so sorry.

01:15:57.253 --> 01:15:58.853
      - I should be the
      one who is sorry.

01:15:58.855 --> 01:16:00.788
 I apologize for running late.

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:01.923
     We still have a spot?

01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:03.858
     - Yes, you're next.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.993
  - Can I tell you a secret?

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:07.728
         I'm nervous.

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:08.930
    - You have butterflies.

01:16:08.932 --> 01:16:11.832
- Yes, a thousand beating wings.

01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:13.434
 - That just means you care.

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:17.471
     - Oh, that's your cue.

01:16:17.473 --> 01:16:19.540
  Go knock 'em dead, kiddo.

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:23.678
(crowd cheering and applauding)

01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:32.186
      ("Heart and Soul")

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:33.648
     (audience applauding
     and cheering)

01:17:45.428 --> 01:17:46.327
            - Daddy!

01:17:47.063 --> 01:17:48.929
     - That was incredible.

01:17:48.931 --> 01:17:50.031
     Where did you learn
     to play like that?

01:17:50.033 --> 01:17:51.232
 - Nana and Walter taught me.

01:17:51.234 --> 01:17:54.635
 - Well, I hope you stay humble
 when you become a big star.

01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:55.736
          - I won't.

01:17:55.738 --> 01:17:57.538
      - You are your
      father's daughter.

01:17:58.508 --> 01:18:00.541
      For you, maestro.

01:18:00.543 --> 01:18:01.709
        - Glad you came.

01:18:01.711 --> 01:18:04.045
        - Well next time
        I say, I'll try,

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:05.846
         I'll mean it.

01:18:07.583 --> 01:18:09.150
 I got one more thing for you.

01:18:09.152 --> 01:18:10.384
            Hold on.

01:18:10.386 --> 01:18:11.385
         Here we go.

01:18:13.656 --> 01:18:14.822
- You know it, I'll hold those,

01:18:14.824 --> 01:18:17.792
 while you open your card,
 and I'll be right back, okay?

01:18:20.396 --> 01:18:21.462
        - It's for more.

01:18:24.067 --> 01:18:25.399
         - Thanks Dad.

01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:26.901
         - Come here.

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:27.902
         I love you.

01:18:31.274 --> 01:18:32.606
    - She was really great.

01:18:32.608 --> 01:18:33.541
            - Yeah.

01:18:33.543 --> 01:18:34.809
     Walter was great, too.

01:18:34.811 --> 01:18:35.910
        - He was, right?

01:18:35.912 --> 01:18:38.145
     Did talent just
     skip our generation?

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:39.647
  - We have other strengths.

01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:41.449
            - Maybe.

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:46.053
I called my friend up in Alaska,

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:49.724
 and he said that pilot job
 is mine if I still want it.

01:18:51.828 --> 01:18:53.294
    I'm flying out tomorrow.

01:18:57.333 --> 01:19:00.234
 - I'm really happy for you.

01:19:01.637 --> 01:19:02.570
          - Thanks.

01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:17.852
         - You be safe.

01:19:19.021 --> 01:19:22.189
     - You know me, I'm
     as safe as they come.

01:19:37.473 --> 01:19:38.339
             Dad?

01:19:40.343 --> 01:19:41.275
         - I'm ready.

01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:51.552
         - Here you go.

01:19:55.992 --> 01:19:57.525
    - All the Beauman women.

01:19:58.261 --> 01:19:59.827
  - Happy Mother's Day, Mom.

01:19:59.829 --> 01:20:00.661
         We love you.

01:20:00.663 --> 01:20:02.029
- And happy Mother's Day to you,

01:20:02.031 --> 01:20:04.365
     and you, your first.

01:20:04.367 --> 01:20:07.234
     - Yeah, it's her
     first Mother's Day.

01:20:09.572 --> 01:20:10.771
    - Hey, where's Charley,

01:20:10.773 --> 01:20:12.807
     I thought that he and
     Walter would be here.

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:16.610
      - I fired Charley.

01:20:16.612 --> 01:20:17.778
            - What?

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:20.714
      - Elizabeth Jane,
      you fired Charley?

01:20:20.716 --> 01:20:21.715
             Why?

01:20:21.717 --> 01:20:24.485
    - Well he did something
    brash, reckless.

01:20:25.588 --> 01:20:27.254
      Look, he was just
      trying to help,

01:20:27.256 --> 01:20:29.757
     but he put a lot of
     people in danger.

01:20:29.759 --> 01:20:31.425
        - Hire him back.

01:20:31.427 --> 01:20:32.493
             What?

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:33.694
     She just said he
     was trying to help.

01:20:33.696 --> 01:20:35.129
         Hire him back.

01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:37.932
     - Even if I wanted to,
     he took another job,

01:20:38.901 --> 01:20:39.900
          in Alaska.

01:20:41.704 --> 01:20:42.603
        Leaves tomorrow.

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:05.092
  - I've done you a dishonor
  after you passed, my dear.

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:11.198
  You were so full of life,

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:16.303
  you never would have
  wanted me to stop living.

01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:18.973
     You have a promise,

01:21:20.776 --> 01:21:23.177
     a promise from the
     bottom of my heart,

01:21:23.179 --> 01:21:25.312
        I will live and,

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.820
    I will love you forever.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:59.346
 (sentimental orchestral music)

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:21.035
 - Here she comes, hey mamma.

01:22:21.037 --> 01:22:22.870
 - Oh my back is killing me.

01:22:22.872 --> 01:22:24.905
  - [Lizzie] I am so sorry.

01:22:24.907 --> 01:22:26.273
  - Last night it was so bad

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:28.943
 I was Googling home
 remedies for inducing labor.

01:22:28.945 --> 01:22:30.644
     - You're almost there.

01:22:30.646 --> 01:22:31.545
         Have some tea.

01:22:32.381 --> 01:22:34.615
 - She was due, two days ago.

01:22:34.617 --> 01:22:35.616
 You don't think that there's--

01:22:35.618 --> 01:22:37.518
 - No, it's completely normal.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:41.755
     - You know why I've
     been bothering you

01:22:41.757 --> 01:22:42.690
  with all this baby stuff?

01:22:42.692 --> 01:22:45.225
- You want me to be your doctor?

01:22:45.227 --> 01:22:46.226
             - Yes.

01:22:46.228 --> 01:22:48.862
    Okay, I know you became
    an administrator,

01:22:48.864 --> 01:22:50.764
     so you could be
     there more for Quinn,

01:22:50.766 --> 01:22:53.867
    but I can tell you miss
    being an OB-GYN, too.

01:22:53.869 --> 01:22:57.071
     So I thought, helping
     me, I don't know,

01:22:57.073 --> 01:22:58.906
      you could get that
      feeling again.

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:01.675
     - That is so sweet.

01:23:01.677 --> 01:23:03.010
          Thank you.

01:23:03.012 --> 01:23:05.312
  - You're my big sister,
  it's the least I could do.

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:08.916
 And I think for the record,
 I'm the nice sister?

01:23:08.918 --> 01:23:09.683
            - Okay.

01:23:09.685 --> 01:23:10.851
    - And as a nice sister,

01:23:10.853 --> 01:23:13.387
     I would be remiss if I
     didn't tell you that,

01:23:13.389 --> 01:23:15.422
     you were crazy for
     letting Charley go.

01:23:16.592 --> 01:23:17.591
            - Barb.

01:23:17.593 --> 01:23:19.560
    - I'm just saying,
    you're gonna regret it.

01:23:19.562 --> 01:23:20.894
     - Well you know what?

01:23:20.896 --> 01:23:24.798
 He was the one that decided
 to take a job in Alaska.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.333
 - And did you ask him to stay?

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:29.536
    - Not in so many words.

01:23:29.538 --> 01:23:31.538
 - How many words did you use?

01:23:33.909 --> 01:23:35.342
     - When he was coming
     in for a landing,

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:36.510
    I had to make a choice,

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:39.580
 what's best for the hospital,
 over my feelings for him.

01:23:39.582 --> 01:23:42.616
 This is the exact situation
 that I was wanting to avoid.

01:23:42.618 --> 01:23:44.251
     - You think you made
     the wrong decision?

01:23:44.253 --> 01:23:47.988
- No, and he ignored me anyway.

01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:50.424
    - Sounds like a risk
    he was willing to take.

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:53.260
     - I need more milk.

01:23:55.664 --> 01:23:57.898
    You know what, I have to
    think about Quinn, too.

01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:02.169
  I mean, he's a pilot,
  what if something happens?

01:24:02.171 --> 01:24:04.605
     With everything that
     she's been through.

01:24:04.607 --> 01:24:05.539
          You know?

01:24:07.109 --> 01:24:07.941
             Barb?

01:24:07.943 --> 01:24:08.809
             - Oh!

01:24:08.811 --> 01:24:11.512
 - Okay, yep, yep, it's time.

01:24:11.514 --> 01:24:14.181
 All right, all right, great,

01:24:14.183 --> 01:24:17.284
 all right, we're gonna get
 to the hospital, you're good.

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:20.521
     All right, you want
     to go to the left.

01:24:20.523 --> 01:24:21.455
         Hey, Felicia.

01:24:21.457 --> 01:24:22.689
     - Room 3-A is clear.

01:24:22.691 --> 01:24:23.590
         - Thank you.

01:24:29.532 --> 01:24:30.431
         - Thank you.

01:24:34.103 --> 01:24:35.235
      - How's she doing?

01:24:35.237 --> 01:24:36.370
     - She's doing great.

01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:39.740
         Are you gonna?

01:24:39.742 --> 01:24:40.874
        - She's family.

01:24:40.876 --> 01:24:42.609
     The least I can do
     is deliver her baby.

01:24:46.949 --> 01:24:50.017
     I put up boundaries
     between home and work

01:24:50.019 --> 01:24:52.186
to protect the ones that I love,

01:24:52.188 --> 01:24:57.224
 but it turns out the only one
 I was protecting was myself.

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:04.698
  I know about you and Todd.

01:25:07.203 --> 01:25:08.936
- I was gonna tell you, I just--

01:25:08.938 --> 01:25:10.938
     - He's a great guy,

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:14.775
     and you two, make a
     really cute couple.

01:25:15.845 --> 01:25:18.212
 But, if he breaks your heart,

01:25:19.248 --> 01:25:21.248
I know a few orthopedic surgeons

01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:22.816
 who break bones for a living.

01:25:25.354 --> 01:25:26.286
      - Thanks, Lizzie.

01:25:28.491 --> 01:25:29.389
            - Yeah.

01:25:35.998 --> 01:25:39.533
 Okay Barb, you guys ready to
 get this show on the road?

01:25:39.535 --> 01:25:40.400
            - Yeah.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:42.369
     - You're doing great.

01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:43.270
          - Thanks.

01:25:47.109 --> 01:25:49.843
        (phone ringing)

01:25:52.815 --> 01:25:54.548
    - [Lizzie] Hi, you've
    reached Lizzie Beauman,

01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:55.482
  sorry I couldn't pick up,

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:56.450
 but if you leave me a message,

01:25:56.452 --> 01:25:57.651
     I will call you back.

01:26:08.297 --> 01:26:10.130
         - Oh, hi baby.

01:26:12.401 --> 01:26:13.367
      Thank you, Lizzie.

01:26:15.204 --> 01:26:17.971
      I mean I did do
      most of the work,

01:26:17.973 --> 01:26:18.805
         but thank you.

01:26:18.807 --> 01:26:19.873
        - Yes, you did.

01:26:23.412 --> 01:26:25.045
 I'll give you guys some time.

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:28.849
         - Hi Daddy.

01:26:33.956 --> 01:26:35.556
     Oh, are you sleepy?

01:26:50.372 --> 01:26:51.772
         What is it?

01:26:51.774 --> 01:26:53.240
      - Charley called.

01:26:53.242 --> 01:26:56.243
 - I thought you said he
 was going to Alaska, today?

01:26:56.245 --> 01:26:57.578
    - He was supposed to be.

01:26:58.714 --> 01:26:59.646
         - Go get him.

01:27:02.418 --> 01:27:03.684
     - You just had a baby.

01:27:03.686 --> 01:27:05.352
        - So? I'm fine.

01:27:05.354 --> 01:27:08.188
  But, you're fired, you're
  no longer my doctor.

01:27:08.190 --> 01:27:09.590
         Go get him.

01:27:09.592 --> 01:27:10.724
            - Okay.

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:11.592
             - Go.

01:27:21.003 --> 01:27:23.003
     - Come on, pick up,
     pick up, pick up.

01:27:36.952 --> 01:27:39.019
  Hey, Charley, it's Lizzie.

01:27:39.021 --> 01:27:41.388
 You've probably already left,

01:27:42.858 --> 01:27:44.324
 but maybe you haven't left,

01:27:44.326 --> 01:27:46.960
    and if you haven't left,
    please don't leave,

01:27:46.962 --> 01:27:50.030
     not until I tell you
     what I have to say.

01:27:50.032 --> 01:27:52.633
 You know what, never mind,
 this is just a waste of time.

01:27:56.672 --> 01:27:59.539
        (engine running)

01:28:01.076 --> 01:28:04.911
 ("What the Word Needs Now")

01:28:21.964 --> 01:28:24.665
        (phone ringing)

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:28.735
          - Lizzie?

01:28:30.939 --> 01:28:32.239
     You're hard to hear.

01:28:52.528 --> 01:28:53.427
            Charley?

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:55.696
            Charley?

01:28:57.099 --> 01:28:57.998
            Charley!

01:29:06.041 --> 01:29:06.940
            Charley!

01:29:22.324 --> 01:29:23.623
        - Are you okay?

01:29:23.625 --> 01:29:26.159
  - Everything's fine, yeah,
  it's good, it's good.

01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:27.728
 I think you forgot something.

01:29:39.808 --> 01:29:43.343
     I'm sure you two have
     plenty to talk about.

01:29:43.345 --> 01:29:44.911
 Hope you have a good speech.

01:29:52.321 --> 01:29:53.754
  - Your Dad is a good man.

01:29:56.024 --> 01:29:57.557
 - He does have his moments.

01:29:59.962 --> 01:30:01.061
     - You know the first
     time I met you,

01:30:01.063 --> 01:30:02.763
I thought I was gonna hate you.

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:06.466
 - That's not how I expected

01:30:06.468 --> 01:30:08.001
      this to start.
      - You're cavalier,

01:30:08.003 --> 01:30:13.240
 impulsive, you have an almost
 terrifying hero complex.

01:30:14.209 --> 01:30:15.442
- This isn't getting any better.

01:30:15.444 --> 01:30:16.810
      - And yet every
      time I'm with you,

01:30:16.812 --> 01:30:18.545
 every time I think about you,

01:30:21.517 --> 01:30:22.783
      I get butterflies.

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:28.789
     It means that I care

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:31.725
          about you,

01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:35.295
            so much.

01:30:39.201 --> 01:30:40.767
I was so closed off for so long,

01:30:40.769 --> 01:30:41.935
that my daughter had to make it

01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:45.639
    her own personal mission
    to find me a friend.

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:55.482
 Well, mission accomplished.

01:30:57.619 --> 01:31:01.555
 I don't want to separate
 my life into boxes anymore.

01:31:01.557 --> 01:31:04.991
    I want to live one life,

01:31:06.895 --> 01:31:07.794
          with you.

01:31:15.304 --> 01:31:16.336

    (acoustic guitar music)

01:31:37.392 --> 01:31:39.826
     - Was that the answer
     you were hoping for?

01:31:41.230 --> 01:31:44.664
  - I decided to stop
  managing my expectations.

01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:45.699
            - Good.

01:31:45.701 --> 01:31:46.600
            - Yeah.

01:31:56.512 --> 01:31:58.945
     - You know, she has
     a full tank of gas.

01:32:00.315 --> 01:32:01.548
         You up for it?

01:32:03.185 --> 01:32:04.050
            - Yeah.

01:32:05.153 --> 01:32:06.419
         I'm up for it.
