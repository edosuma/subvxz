I just don't understand         
this word association stuff.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.400
Right, allow me
                 to demonstrate.

00:09.500 --> 00:11.900
Now, I'll say a word,   
                and then you say

00:11.900 --> 00:13.100
the first word
              that you think of.

out of that, uh,

00:33.000 --> 00:34.700
Perhaps in the house
             Woody grew up in,

00:34.700 --> 00:37.700
the thermostat was
                at the bottom   
                  of the stairs.

00:37.700 --> 00:38.900
Actually, it was in the kitchen.

take cash or check.

No, no, or, uh, well,

00:42.600 --> 00:44.800
the, uh, the heater may have
    been in the, uh, cellar,

00:44.800 --> 00:47.000
and so it was at the
            bottom of the house.

Nope.

Woody,             
did you turn up the heat again?

Yes, Miss Howe.

I told you,           
     it's too hot in here.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.300
Now, if you keep turning it up, 
I have to keep turning it down.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.400
That wouldn't   
                be a problem

      the damn thermostat

Hi, Mom.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.600
...to share.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.500
Sam, you remember Laurie.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.700
Hi.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.700
( <i>laughing ):</i>          
               Wow.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.700
You used to be so...

07:18.700 --> 07:19.500
And now she's so...

07:19.700 --> 07:23.400
So, uh... hey, how are you?

07:23.400 --> 07:25.000
I'm fine, Mr. Malone.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.100
"Mr. Malone"?

07:26.100 --> 07:27.600
Hey, come on, I'm the same guy

07:27.700 --> 07:29.700
that used to push you      
         in the swings

07:29.700 --> 07:31.900
and give you            
        piggy-back rides

07:31.900 --> 07:33.200
and play with you           
        in the bathtub.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.400
No, that was me.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.800
Oh, right, right, right.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.100
Well, look at the two of you.

07:39.100 --> 07:41.400
Look at the three of us.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.000
Let's look at the two of you  
             again.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.300
Look, I know you two

07:46.400 --> 07:49.600
have a lot of catching up to do,
     but it was really good

07:49.700 --> 07:50.900
to see you                      
again, Sam.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.700
Oh, wow, I just flashed     
        on the way

07:52.700 --> 07:55.400
you used to make me hold        
your hand crossing the street.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.600
Anyway, I'll see you.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.700
Wait, wait, where you going?

07:57.700 --> 07:58.800
What's the rush?

07:58.900 --> 08:01.000
Why is my voice so high?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I got an idea.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.200
Uh, why don't, uh,

08:05.200 --> 08:07.800
why don't the three of us       
          uh, do, uh,

08:07.900 --> 08:10.400
one of those things we used   
    to do in the old days--

08:10.500 --> 08:12.500
You know, get an
                  ice cream cone
         together, or something.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.500
I would love that.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.600
Do you know                     
something, Sam?

08:14.600 --> 08:15.900
What?               
I am really glad

08:15.900 --> 08:17.700
that I picked up the phone      
and called you.

08:17.800 --> 08:18.700
Oh, me, too.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.500
Come on, Uncle Sammy.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.400
There's a lot of traffic        
out there.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.000
( <i>high-pitched laugh</i> )

08:31.800 --> 08:33.500
Looks like Sammy's              
heading for trouble.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.299
Yeah, looks like
             kind of a fun trip,
             though, doesn't it?

08:42.299 --> 08:44.200
Carla, did you have       
the soft drinks delivered

08:44.200 --> 08:46.100
to Mrs. Ridgeway's house
        for the party tomorrow?

08:46.100 --> 08:47.500
Yeah, yeah-- four cases.

08:47.500 --> 08:51.400
The kids will be burping
        all through Woody's act.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.600
Don't worry, with this outfit   
and these props,

08:54.600 --> 08:58.100
I'm going to have those kids    
rolling on the floor.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.200
Yeah, rolling around            
and burping--

08:59.200 --> 09:01.800
now <i>there's</i> an attractive image 
for you.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.800
You know, Woody, I envy you,  
          I really do.

09:03.900 --> 09:05.900
Creating laughter           
     can be a healing art.

09:05.900 --> 09:09.400
Sometimes a clown can do better 
      than a psychiatrist.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.600
Yeah, and you can fit more      
of them into a little car.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.200
Got my funny horn,              
my squirting flower,

09:17.200 --> 09:18.600
my joke book--
                can't miss.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.900
CARLA:                          
Oh, yeah?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.500
Let's see an example            
of a joke that can't miss.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.700
"Did you hear about             
                        Yeah.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.200
"the human cannonball?

09:25.200 --> 09:27.600
It's hard to find a man         
of his caliber."

09:29.000 --> 09:32.600
I don't, uh, hear any hilarity 
    ensuing there, Wood-man.

09:32.600 --> 09:35.400
Oh, you have to try them
        both at the same time--

09:35.500 --> 09:37.300
the props <i>and</i> the jokes.

09:37.300 --> 09:38.800
Try it again.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.500
Boy, this is going              
to be flop city.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.500
"Did you hear                   
about the human cannonball?

09:43.600 --> 09:45.600
It's hard to find               
a man of his caliber."

09:45.600 --> 09:46.700
( <i>horn honks</i> )

09:49.400 --> 09:54.000
( <i>laughter</i> )

09:54.100 --> 09:57.000
See? Can't miss.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.000
Let me try this.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.500
This looks like fun.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.100
Uh, all right. "You hear    
    about the sword swallower

10:02.200 --> 10:04.400
who only eats penknives
         'cause he's on a diet?"

10:04.400 --> 10:05.400
( <i>horn honks</i> )

10:05.400 --> 10:08.300
( <i>laughter</i> )

10:12.400 --> 10:14.600
All right, all right,           
you think that's funny?

10:14.600 --> 10:16.200
Go ahead, Norm,

10:16.300 --> 10:16.800
do another one.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.500
All right.

10:18.500 --> 10:22.300
Uh, "Did you hear about
         the, uh, the tightrope 
          walker who went nuts?

10:22.400 --> 10:24.500
They had to, uh,
         throw a net <i>under</i> him."

10:24.500 --> 10:26.600
( <i>horn honks</i> )

10:32.900 --> 10:33.900
You know, you're right.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.800
It <i>is</i> funnier when you do it.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.500
Here we go.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.100
Thanks, Uncle Sammy,      
        that was great,

10:43.200 --> 10:44.900
but I've got to get             
to aerobics class.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.000
I'll call you tonight,          
Mom.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.100
Bye, honey.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.100
God, kids are fun!              
                 Mmm.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.700
I especially loved taking her  
    to that department store

10:53.700 --> 10:55.200
and watching her little face  
        light up.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.800
Obviously.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.000
Hey, come on,

10:58.000 --> 10:59.300
what's the matter   
                    with you?

10:59.300 --> 11:00.400
I'm getting a little tired

11:00.500 --> 11:03.700
of having you invite Laurie     
along with us everywhere we go.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.300
Oh, now, come on.

11:05.300 --> 11:07.700
Mommy needs a little            
quality time for herself.

11:07.700 --> 11:11.600
Well, sweetheart, all 
          you had to do was ask.

11:11.700 --> 11:14.400
Listen, what do you say         
I pick you up around 8:00--

11:14.500 --> 11:15.600
just the two of us,

11:15.600 --> 11:17.000
all evening?

11:17.100 --> 11:18.300
Adults only.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.300
Mmm.              
                    Mmm.

11:21.300 --> 11:24.100
Caution, some scenes            
may be unsuitable

11:24.200 --> 11:25.500
for immature viewers.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.200
I'll close my eyes.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.700
SAM:                            
Oh, God!

11:34.700 --> 11:36.900
Why? What?

11:36.900 --> 11:37.900
What's the matter?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I guess I'm remembering
                what happened

11:40.000 --> 11:41.300
the last time you tried

11:41.300 --> 11:43.300
to pitch both ends 
             of a double header.

11:45.700 --> 11:46.800
Oh, boy.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.000
Is it that obvious?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.300
I think it was
            the drooling that   
                  gave you away.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.700
Yeah, well, see, the thing is

11:53.800 --> 11:56.000
that I'm really attracted       
to Laurie,

11:56.000 --> 11:57.700
and I want to ask her out,

11:57.800 --> 12:00.600
but I don't want to stop dating 
the mother at the same time.

12:00.700 --> 12:03.000
I mean, it's like               
a real problem, you know?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.200
Gee,

12:04.300 --> 12:06.100
must be a burden
             being so sensitive.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.500
Yeah.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.700
Uh, Sammy,      
                door number two.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.500
Hey, Laurie, what'd you
         do, forget something?

12:15.600 --> 12:17.600
Well, my class was canceled,    
so I was gonna find Mom

12:17.600 --> 12:19.100
and see if she wanted           
to grab some lunch.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.400
But I guess she                 
already left, huh?

12:20.500 --> 12:21.700
Yeah, just a few minutes ago.

12:21.700 --> 12:22.800
Oh, well, it's no biggie.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.200
Well, wait a minute,
            wait a minute.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.900
Listen, uh, if you      
        have a couple minutes

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
on your hand here...

12:27.000 --> 12:29.200
I'm about due for a break,
      aren't I, Rebecca?

12:29.200 --> 12:30.500
Hell yes, you've been           
back at work

12:30.600 --> 12:33.300
for almost five minutes.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.400
Wouldn't it be a hoot      
     if your uncle took you

12:35.400 --> 12:38.600
back to the same zoo,      
      but 15 years later?

12:38.600 --> 12:39.700
How about it, guys?

12:39.700 --> 12:41.200
Would that be a "hoot"          
or what?

12:44.300 --> 12:45.900
Uncle Sammy,                    
you're too much.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.600
I'll go bring                   
the car around.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.100
Great, I'll meet you      
        up there, okay?

12:49.100 --> 12:50.800
Just a minute.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.100
Zoos are kind of sad,           
you know?

12:52.100 --> 12:53.200
Huh?

12:53.200 --> 12:55.400
I mean, all those               
sedentary animals...

12:55.400 --> 12:57.300
can't move,                     
can't run free,

12:57.300 --> 13:00.300
they just sit there             
and drink

13:00.300 --> 13:04.000
and shovel food                 
in their faces.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.900
Sorry, man, that   
             is no kind of life.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.800
FRASIER:                        
Sam?

13:10.800 --> 13:13.800
You're trying to date           
your girlfriend's daughter.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.200
Now, isn't there                
a little voice

13:15.200 --> 13:16.300
in the back                     
of your mind

13:16.300 --> 13:17.700
trying to tell you              
something?

13:17.700 --> 13:19.700
Little voice?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.600
Your conscience?

13:21.600 --> 13:23.000
My conscience?

13:23.100 --> 13:26.000
You mean like  
                 Jiminy Cricket?

13:28.100 --> 13:30.100
Well, okay.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.400
Well, yeah,         
            as a matter of fact,

13:31.500 --> 13:33.300
I do hear         
              this little voice.

13:33.400 --> 13:37.600
But it's not coming from  
      the direction of my brain.

13:39.800 --> 13:40.800
CARLA:
                          Sammy,

13:40.800 --> 13:42.300
you better be careful.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.000
See, even Carla agrees with me.

13:44.100 --> 13:44.900
No, I'm just worried

13:44.900 --> 13:47.400
that he's going to blow
         it with both chicks.

13:47.500 --> 13:51.200
Mothers and daughters   
        talk to each other.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.400
Well, not in my family,
         but usually.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.500
Sweetheart, I've handled        
trickier situations

13:56.500 --> 13:57.600
than this before.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.000
You remember    
                the time I dated

13:59.000 --> 14:00.700
those lovely    
                Henshaw triplets

14:00.700 --> 14:02.200
all at the same time?

14:02.300 --> 14:03.900
Sammy, first of all,

14:03.900 --> 14:06.700
that was back when          
 you were drinking like a fish.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.400
And second of all,

14:08.400 --> 14:10.400
that was one chick.

14:24.500 --> 14:27.900
Frasier, you okay, bud?

14:27.900 --> 14:30.600
I'm a little            
        concerned here, Norm.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.900
My fingers are tingling.

14:32.900 --> 14:35.900
My hand's numb,     
            my feet are cold.

14:35.900 --> 14:37.900
Either I'm having   
            a heart attack

14:37.900 --> 14:39.600
or this new     
                French underwear
                Lilith gave me

14:39.600 --> 14:42.800
is too tight.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.700
Ah... cancel   
                 the paramedics.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.900
All right, all right.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.900
All right!              
     I'm going on tonight!

14:52.000 --> 14:54.400
I'm going on!   
What do you mean,               
in your theater group?

14:54.400 --> 14:56.600
Yeah, yeah.           
  The lead has a fever of 106.

14:56.700 --> 14:58.800
The rest of the cast      
 tried to drag him out of bed,

14:58.800 --> 15:00.000
but he kept falling down.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.700
I get to go on!

15:03.400 --> 15:04.500
Woody, are you                  
ready to go?

15:04.600 --> 15:06.500
We're going to be late          
for the kiddie party.

15:06.500 --> 15:10.000
Oh, Ms. Howe, I hate to let you 
down, but I can't be your clown.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.000
I'm playing Marc Antony.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.300
"Friends, Romans, countrymen."

15:15.400 --> 15:17.200
What are you                    
talking about?

15:17.200 --> 15:19.900
Countrymen-- people who live  
    outside the city.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
You know, shepherds,
            farmers, ranchers.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Woody, you can't                
desert me like this.

15:24.100 --> 15:26.000
I don't have time               
to get anyone else.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
This is the chance
          he's been waiting for.
Butt out!

15:29.100 --> 15:30.900
You are the one                 
who insisted I hire him

15:31.000 --> 15:31.900
in the first place.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.200
Well, I was merely
              suggesting...

15:33.200 --> 15:34.700
Where am I going to get         
another clown now?!

15:34.700 --> 15:36.200
I am ruined                     
and it's your fault.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.800
You're the one                  
who got me in this mess.

15:37.900 --> 15:41.000
You owe me a clown.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.600
Well, where do you think
        I can find one now?

15:42.600 --> 15:44.700
Gee, Frasier,      
             I mean, weren't you
             the one who said

15:44.700 --> 15:45.800
how much you    
                envied Woody?

15:45.800 --> 15:47.800
Well, yes,              
    I did say that...           
                And that clowns

15:47.800 --> 15:49.300
do more good than   
            psychiatrists?

15:49.400 --> 15:51.100
Well, surely          
    you're not suggesting...

15:51.100 --> 15:52.400
Yeah, you'll be great,     
        Dr. Crane.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.300
Stuff's all right here     
          in this box.

15:54.300 --> 15:55.800
You can't miss.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.100
Me?

15:57.100 --> 16:00.100
You want me to don  
            the jester's motley?

16:00.100 --> 16:01.500
It's got to be you, Dr. Crane.

16:01.500 --> 16:04.100
It takes a big man          
      to fill these shoes.

16:05.900 --> 16:06.900
Well, why not?

16:06.900 --> 16:09.500
I mean, they're just children  
        after all.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.200
And I always have had      
    a special rapport

16:11.300 --> 16:13.300
with the wee people.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.300
Where's the harm?

16:14.400 --> 16:15.500
All right,                      
let's go, Frasier.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.800
We're late already.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.300
Here's your outfit!

16:18.400 --> 16:19.400
Oh, gee, Woody, you know,

16:19.500 --> 16:20.600
I haven't had time              
to rehearse.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.300
I don't know anything           
about being a clown.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.200
You got any last minute advice 
            for me?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.500
Just be yourself.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.900
Ah, words of wisdom.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.200
Well, I'm out 
                  of here, okay?

16:32.300 --> 16:34.900
You think Bozo the Shrink       
    can really cut it?

16:34.900 --> 16:35.900
Are you kidding?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.100
That stuff is foolproof.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.400
The squirting flower, the horn, 
the trick handkerchief...

16:40.400 --> 16:41.200
What trick handkerchief?

16:41.300 --> 16:42.500
You never showed us that.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.100
That's the best one of all.

16:45.100 --> 16:47.000
You pull the handkerchief       
    out of your pocket

16:47.000 --> 16:49.400
and your pants fall down.

16:52.700 --> 16:55.800
Underneath I'm wearing     
        these ridiculous

16:55.900 --> 16:58.200
big red polka dot shorts.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.300
It's a riot!

17:02.300 --> 17:05.800
You mean Frasier's supposed   
  to be wearing those shorts?

17:07.700 --> 17:10.200
Oh, no.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.000
I forgot to give my underwear  
         to Dr. Crane.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.099
I should call.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.900
Well, no, no.          
I've got to get to the theater.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.000
Listen, Carla,         
somebody should warn him.

17:18.099 --> 17:19.099
Would you call him?

17:19.200 --> 17:20.099
Of course.

17:25.099 --> 17:27.300
( <i>laughing</i> )

17:31.400 --> 17:33.400
Okay, kids,         
            you say hi to Binky!

17:33.500 --> 17:36.400
KIDS:                           
Hi, Binky!

17:41.000 --> 17:42.300
Binky, do your act.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.300
I don't have an act,      
      I'm a psychiatrist.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.200
Show them your funny feet.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.400
I can't, I've got  
             these big shoes on.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.900
Oh, I see     
                  what you mean.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.400
Say, kids, what do you      
    think of these feet, huh?

17:59.500 --> 18:01.800
I got such big feet       
 because my mother was a goose.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.600
Want to hear me honk?      
         ( <i>horn honks</i> )

18:07.800 --> 18:10.600
The real clown was killed.

18:13.900 --> 18:15.700
Rebecca, what am I gonna do?

18:15.700 --> 18:17.500
I don't know what               
you're going to do,

18:17.500 --> 18:19.000
but you better think            
of something quick

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
because you're making...

18:20.000 --> 18:21.500
Do the flower deal.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.200
Oh, you mean this.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.000
( <i>laughing</i> )

18:26.000 --> 18:27.300
Hey, they like it!

18:27.400 --> 18:28.700
You want to see     
            that again, kids?

18:28.700 --> 18:30.100
Yeah!

18:34.300 --> 18:36.300
Hey, I'm a clown,   
            I'm a clown!

18:43.000 --> 18:44.700
Hey, guys...

18:44.700 --> 18:46.700
Wait till you hear this.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.700
I'm sitting at a table     
    in this restaurant

18:49.700 --> 18:52.600
with Judy and Laurie.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.200
The mother reaches over         
and grabs my knee and says,

18:55.200 --> 18:57.500
"Sam, I want you."

18:57.500 --> 18:58.800
Get out.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.200
Then I feel the daughter        
reaching over

19:01.200 --> 19:02.800
and grabbing my other knee.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.300
She says, "I want you,          
too, Sammy."

19:06.400 --> 19:08.000
Well, yeah, yeah?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.800
Then I woke up.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.700
You know what this dream means, 
        don't you?

19:15.800 --> 19:19.200
Mm-hmm, it means  
              you even dream    
              better than we do.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.300
No, no, it means        
     that Frasier's right.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.500
That my conscience          
    is getting to me.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.000
You know,      
                 I must feel bad

19:25.000 --> 19:26.800
that I'm going out          
        with this woman

19:26.800 --> 19:29.800
while I'm trying to score with 
 her daughter at the same time.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.000
Sammy, you're scaring me.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.800
How do you think I feel?

19:33.800 --> 19:36.100
I mean, this hasn't       
  ever happened to me before.

19:36.100 --> 19:38.300
I mean, you don't think that...

19:38.400 --> 19:41.000
that I'm getting scruples?

19:41.100 --> 19:43.300
Now you just stop it      
    right there, buddy boy.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.500
You're talking crazy.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.300
Damn it, I mean,

19:47.300 --> 19:48.500
I really hate this.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.900
I keep hearing this little voice

19:49.900 --> 19:51.700
and this time          
it's coming from my brain

19:51.700 --> 19:53.200
and it just, it won't shut up.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.600
And I got this feeling

19:54.700 --> 19:55.800
that it's going                 
to keep nagging me

19:55.800 --> 19:57.400
until I just                    
do the right thing

19:57.500 --> 19:59.600
and break it off                
with the daughter.

19:59.700 --> 20:02.100
Whoa, wait, wait,       
        Sammy, Sammy, listen.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.800
I could probably weather    
      this scruples stuff,

20:04.900 --> 20:06.500
but the guys...

20:06.500 --> 20:09.400
I mean, they look 
              up to you so much.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.400
Sammy.        
                  Sammy, please.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.700
Reconsider, okay?

20:12.700 --> 20:15.100
A mother and    
                her daughter.

20:15.100 --> 20:16.300
This was going 
                 to be something

20:16.300 --> 20:17.900
I could tell        
            my grandchildren.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.800
Oh, Sam, Sam.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.100
Listen, guys.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.300
I just have to do               
the right thing here.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.800
Hi.         
Hi.

20:28.800 --> 20:29.900
What ya doing?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.900
I want to talk to you.

20:31.900 --> 20:34.800
I hope I'm doing the right      
thing coming to you.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.700
My mom doesn't know             
I'm here.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.400
I don't know how                
to ask you this.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.100
I've never                      
done it before.

20:41.200 --> 20:44.200
Ooh...

20:44.300 --> 20:45.900
Go on.

20:45.900 --> 20:47.100
Sam, when I                     
was a little girl

20:47.100 --> 20:49.100
I used to think you were        
the most wonderful man

20:49.200 --> 20:50.400
in the whole world.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.600
I still do.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.100
But I'm not a little            
girl anymore.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.800
ALL:              
            Ooh...!

20:58.000 --> 20:59.500
Would you, uh,
                  wait a minute?

20:59.600 --> 21:01.100
I'll be right back.

21:01.100 --> 21:03.300
Remember those scruples?    
                        Yeah?

21:03.400 --> 21:04.600
To the showers.

21:10.300 --> 21:12.900
Say, Laurie,

21:12.900 --> 21:14.800
I want to tell you              
how happy I am

21:14.900 --> 21:17.100
that you feel you can           
come and talk to me.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.900
Because I feel that             
you and I have this...

21:19.000 --> 21:20.700
Oh, look at that.               
A new ring?

21:20.800 --> 21:22.900
That's what I came
              to ask you.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
What?                       
             I'm getting married

21:25.000 --> 21:26.400
and I want you  
                to give me away.

21:26.400 --> 21:30.100
Why you little,                 
sl... sly one.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.000
Who's the lucky guy?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.300
Oh, it's a guy  
                I met at school.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.100
We've been going together   
    a couple years.

21:38.100 --> 21:39.300
You know,

21:39.300 --> 21:41.700
he's a lot like         
    a young you, Sam.

21:43.800 --> 21:44.900
Thank you.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.700
I can't wait to give you away.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.400
Thank you, Uncle Sammy.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.400
I love you.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.000
Yeah, whatever.
                 Run along.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.400
I'm so sorry.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.300
Don't feel bad, Sammy.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.300
I let you guys down.

22:04.300 --> 22:05.600
CARLA:        
                  Listen, Sammy.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.300
Sure, things didn't
             go your way

22:08.400 --> 22:10.700
and, sure, we're      
          a little disappointed,

22:10.700 --> 22:12.100
but we'll get over it.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.400
What's important here

22:13.500 --> 22:16.500
is that you tried     
          to do the wrong thing.

22:18.100 --> 22:20.800
Hey, that's right,              
I did, didn't I?                
                        Sammy,

22:20.900 --> 22:22.200
( <i>chanting</i> ):          
         Sammy, Sammy!

22:27.200 --> 22:30.100
( <i>applause</i> )

22:30.200 --> 22:32.200
Thank you. Okay, now I think  
    there's some more

22:32.300 --> 22:33.500
cake and ice cream in there   
            for you.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.400
Yay!

22:35.400 --> 22:37.900
Oh, Binky, you were wonderful.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.100
I must admit I was              
a bit worried at first,

22:40.100 --> 22:42.100
it took us quite a while        
to warm up to you.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.500
Yes, well, thank you,   
        kind lady.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.500
See, actually I have
        a confession to make.   
    Ah?

22:45.500 --> 22:48.600
I'm really Dr. Frasier Crane,   
practicing psychiatrist.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.800
Clowning is     
                my avocation.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.400
And, Ms. Howe,

22:52.500 --> 22:54.500
I will be sure to       
        mention to my husband

22:54.600 --> 22:56.400
the splendid work     
          you did on this party.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.900
Thank you, Mrs. Ridgeway.

22:57.900 --> 23:00.600
Now, if you will       
         excuse me for a moment.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.900
You have no idea                
how lucky we are.

23:05.900 --> 23:07.100
That was Woody                  
on the phone.

23:07.100 --> 23:08.500
He called                       
to check up on us.

23:08.600 --> 23:11.800
That handkerchief               
is a trick handkerchief.

23:11.900 --> 23:13.600
If you had pulled               
that out of your pocket,

23:13.600 --> 23:16.000
your pants would have fallen    
down around your ankles

23:16.100 --> 23:18.400
and then we would've seen       
those skimpy underpants.

23:18.400 --> 23:19.600
Oh, good Lord.

23:19.600 --> 23:20.600
That's not the half of it.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.700
You see, I took off that    
    little French torture device

23:22.800 --> 23:24.000
that Lilith got me
              earlier today.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.600
I've been doing this
            al fresco.

23:27.900 --> 23:29.100
Dr. Crane,

23:29.200 --> 23:30.700
would you come here
             for a moment?

23:30.700 --> 23:32.200
I'd like you to
                 meet my mother.

23:32.300 --> 23:33.400
Why yes, I'd be delighted to.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.900
I've heard such wonderful things
        about her.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
( <i>sneezes</i> ) 
    Gesundheit, madam.

23:36.100 --> 23:37.100
Here's my handkerchief.

23:37.100 --> 23:38.200
REBECCA:
                        No!

23:38.300 --> 23:39.900
( <i>woman screams, loud thud</i> )

23:40.000 --> 23:42.700
MRS. RIDGEWAY:         
         <i>Mother? Mother?</i>
