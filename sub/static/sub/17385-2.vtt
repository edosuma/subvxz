08:19.969 --> 08:21.802
A mosquito. A mosquito.

08:21.904 --> 08:24.137
A mosquito? Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.740
Yeah, okay, bloodsucker.
Mosquito makes much more sense.

08:26.842 --> 08:28.451
Yeah, maybe I took a
little more literal,

08:28.476 --> 08:30.033
but when you think bloodsuckers,

08:30.058 --> 08:32.756
I-I always think, uh, you know,
mosquitoes, a swarm, maybe.

08:32.780 --> 08:36.250
Okay. So you're all gonna be
donating blood today, correct?

08:36.275 --> 08:39.128
All of us except for maybe one of us

08:39.153 --> 08:40.419
is, uh, is not gonna donate.

08:40.522 --> 08:42.657
I'm gonna be donating
something more valuable.

08:42.682 --> 08:45.316
I'm giving anybody who gives blood today

08:45.594 --> 08:48.929
a discount on anything
they buy at the Stash today.

08:49.031 --> 08:51.865
Wow. You're just a wuss
is what you're saying.

08:51.967 --> 08:53.301
I-I... eh.

08:53.326 --> 08:54.285
It's what everyone else is saying.

08:54.310 --> 08:56.483
- You may as well say it too.
- [laughter]

08:56.508 --> 08:57.841
Well, I'm pretty impressed.

08:58.084 --> 08:59.905
A lot of people focus
on her attractiveness,

08:59.930 --> 09:03.454
but, uh, her personality and her
snarkiness definitely came out.

09:03.479 --> 09:06.013
She was busting balls with
the rest of us and, uh...

09:06.115 --> 09:08.215
I caught you a couple times
staring at her snarkiness.

09:08.317 --> 09:10.550
[laughter]

09:10.653 --> 09:12.920
You seemed very impressed. [laughter]

09:13.022 --> 09:14.955
Sure is a lot of snark, Elvira.

09:15.057 --> 09:17.082
[laughter]

09:17.107 --> 09:18.677
- both: Right this way.
- Whoo!

09:18.702 --> 09:21.637
I think it's a fitting throne
for the Mistress of the Dark.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.307
This is nice, boys.

09:23.332 --> 09:25.099
Sure know how to treat a gal.

09:25.124 --> 09:26.600
While we're waiting for
the blood drive to begin,

09:26.702 --> 09:28.302
would you mind if I
asked you a question?

09:28.404 --> 09:29.770
No, go ahead. Fire.

09:29.872 --> 09:31.238
Forgive me if it's stupid, though.

09:31.340 --> 09:32.606
- Something...
- I'm expecting that.

09:32.631 --> 09:33.632
[laughter]

09:33.657 --> 09:35.385
Something just doesn't jive right.

09:35.410 --> 09:37.277
I mean, I thought you were a vampire,

09:37.513 --> 09:38.819
but you got no fangs,

09:38.844 --> 09:40.513
and you're out walking
around in the daytime.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.826
I do maybe look a
little bit like a vampire

09:42.851 --> 09:45.585
but it was actually my
mother was a famous sorceress.

09:45.688 --> 09:49.289
My dad was a film critic,
so I'm really not a vampire,

09:49.391 --> 09:51.502
although a lot of people
do mistake me for one.

09:51.527 --> 09:53.103
But unlike vampires like you,

09:53.128 --> 09:55.806
I give blood because I'm not a big wuss.

09:55.831 --> 09:56.487
[laughter]

09:56.512 --> 09:59.343
You must have seen
countless horror movies.

09:59.368 --> 10:00.521
Countless.

10:00.546 --> 10:03.714
So what are, say, your
top three favorites?

10:03.739 --> 10:06.807
Since we're on, like, kind
of a bloody theme today,

10:06.909 --> 10:09.076
- "Silent Night, Bloody Night"...
- Ooh.

10:09.178 --> 10:12.079
That was the first...
first film I ever hosted.

10:12.181 --> 10:14.025
"Blood Feast," uh...

10:14.050 --> 10:15.449
- Old school.
- Yeah.

10:15.709 --> 10:17.746
And, speaking of the best blood scenes,

10:17.771 --> 10:20.030
I got to go with my man Bryan there.

10:20.055 --> 10:22.622
I mean, "Carrie," talk
about buckets of blood.

10:22.725 --> 10:25.446
I mean, that was
literally buckets of blood.

10:25.471 --> 10:26.870
You know this is pig blood, right?

10:26.895 --> 10:28.479
- [laughter]
- I want it to be authentic.

10:28.504 --> 10:29.670
- [laughter]
- Oh, really? It really is?

10:29.695 --> 10:31.495
I was wondering what the smell was.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.496
So you're not just a TV and horror icon.

10:34.521 --> 10:36.280
You're also a comic book icon.

10:36.305 --> 10:37.499
How did that come about?

10:37.524 --> 10:39.016
I've been involved in the comic world

10:39.041 --> 10:40.790
for a long, long time.

10:40.815 --> 10:43.120
The very first one I
had was for my movie,

10:43.145 --> 10:46.365
"Elvira: Mistress of
the Dark," by Marvel.

10:46.390 --> 10:48.705
I mean, I remember going
to my first Comic-Con ever

10:48.730 --> 10:49.745
in San Diego

10:49.770 --> 10:52.963
and it was the basement of
some horrible hotel or motel

10:52.988 --> 10:56.390
or something and being,
like, the only girl there.

10:56.415 --> 11:00.150
Just 100,000 geeky
guys wandering around.

11:00.329 --> 11:02.362
I want to thank you for
signing my comic book that day.

11:02.464 --> 11:04.064
[laughter]

11:04.166 --> 11:05.685
No problem.

11:05.710 --> 11:08.129
Well, it's been amazing,
you know, to have you here

11:08.154 --> 11:09.336
to ourselves for a little bit,

11:09.361 --> 11:12.416
but it's time to open the doors
and let the blood start flowing.

11:12.441 --> 11:14.174
- Yeah, let's go.
- Let's go, man.

11:14.276 --> 11:16.043
- Let's go.
- After you.

11:16.145 --> 11:17.490
Big "Mystery Science Theater" fan?

11:17.515 --> 11:18.989
I am. I'm quite the MiSTie.

11:19.014 --> 11:21.214
I'm only $400.

11:21.316 --> 11:22.750
[laughter]

11:22.775 --> 11:24.075
- You donated blood, I see?
- I did.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.997
Fantastic. Some of us
are men around here.

11:27.022 --> 11:28.255
I can't hear what you're saying, Elvira.

11:28.357 --> 11:29.356
I can't hear a thing.

11:31.452 --> 11:34.709
You're obviously dressed
up for the big day here.

11:34.734 --> 11:36.666
What the hell are you supposed to be?

11:36.691 --> 11:39.044
I'm Cassidy from "Preacher."
The Irish vampire?

11:39.069 --> 11:40.676
Okay, I thought you just got up

11:40.701 --> 11:42.934
and put on your jeans
and came on down here.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.398
- [laughter]
- Usually his regular wardrobe

11:45.423 --> 11:47.172
doesn't look this cool, so he doesn't...

11:47.274 --> 11:48.640
- [laughter]
- he never rolls out like this.

11:48.665 --> 11:50.532
And you obviously...
we know who you are.

11:50.557 --> 11:52.156
Yeah, you look awesome.

11:52.412 --> 11:55.013
Hope you're practicing safe sucks.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.662
[laughter]

11:57.687 --> 11:58.979
And you.

11:59.004 --> 12:01.240
One of my all-time
favorite-favorite movies.

12:01.265 --> 12:03.532
I'd know you anywhere
except for the facial hair.

12:03.634 --> 12:05.116
[laughter]

12:05.141 --> 12:06.561
Dead ringer for Sissy Spacek, right?

12:06.586 --> 12:10.455
Dead ringer. A few extra
pounds, maybe, but...

12:10.480 --> 12:12.016
[laughter]

12:12.041 --> 12:13.953
As if Carrie didn't have
enough going against her.

12:13.978 --> 12:16.979
[laughter]

12:21.387 --> 12:24.223
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

12:24.325 --> 12:26.191
<i>♪</i> ♪

12:26.293 --> 12:27.726
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, doing good.

12:27.828 --> 12:29.800
Wondering if I could take
a look at that Tom Servo

12:29.825 --> 12:31.413
- in the case over there.
- Absolutely, Mike,

12:31.438 --> 12:32.598
- would you show her, please?
- Sure.

12:32.902 --> 12:34.301
Big "Mystery Science Theater" fan?

12:34.326 --> 12:36.068
I am, I'm quite the MiSTie.

12:36.170 --> 12:39.975
Ah, well, you're in a "Mystery
Science Theater 3000" safe zone.

12:40.000 --> 12:40.670
Oh!

12:40.695 --> 12:42.361
We love that television show, right?

12:42.502 --> 12:45.020
Where are the danger zones
for "Mystery Science Theater"?

12:45.045 --> 12:46.445
Where can't the MiSTies go?

12:46.470 --> 12:47.913
[laughter]

12:48.015 --> 12:49.314
- Oh.
- And here you go.

12:49.416 --> 12:50.949
- Oh, that's amazing.
- Huh?

12:51.051 --> 12:55.614
Now this is a screen-accurate
Tom Servo replica prop.

12:55.639 --> 12:57.264
Oh, that's amazing.

12:58.361 --> 13:06.564
_

13:06.700 --> 13:09.184
Now this is a gorgeous
piece, right Mike?

13:09.209 --> 13:10.135
Oh, my God, look at this.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.214
Quality hover skirt.

13:12.239 --> 13:13.527
All of this is tight,

13:13.552 --> 13:15.474
especially the springs
on the mannequin hands.

13:15.576 --> 13:16.608
Mouth moves.

13:16.710 --> 13:18.277
"Look, I'm Tom Servo."

13:18.302 --> 13:19.555
That's so cool.

13:19.580 --> 13:21.729
Yeah, you're pretty young for
a "Mystery Science Theater" fan.

13:21.754 --> 13:22.892
Where did you discover it?

13:22.917 --> 13:25.076
When I was little, like,
eight... eight or nine or so,

13:25.101 --> 13:26.255
and it was on TV.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.135
I think it was actually
"Cave Dwellers" was, like,

13:28.160 --> 13:30.692
my first episode that
I saw, and I was like,

13:30.724 --> 13:32.916
"Whoa, they're making fun of a movie?"

13:32.941 --> 13:34.909
I'd never seen that before.

13:34.934 --> 13:36.428
Yeah, that is an art form.

13:36.755 --> 13:38.822
They are doing that right off the cuff.

13:38.847 --> 13:41.597
It's a well-oiled machine,
and everybody likes to think,

13:41.622 --> 13:42.862
"Oh, well, I-I could do that too."

13:42.887 --> 13:43.936
I know you're one of those guys.

13:44.038 --> 13:45.979
Y-you... you annoy me so
much if you try to do it

13:46.004 --> 13:48.286
when we go to movies
and it pisses me off.

13:48.311 --> 13:50.454
You're not funny, you don't
have a sense of humor at all,

13:50.479 --> 13:52.690
I wish you'd stop trying
to riff on... on movies

13:52.715 --> 13:53.801
like the "Mystery Science Theater" guys.

13:53.826 --> 13:55.098
I disagree. I think I'm funny.

13:55.123 --> 13:56.114
- [laughter]
- I think I can do it.

13:56.216 --> 13:57.579
You know, some of
them are yelling at me.

13:57.604 --> 13:58.727
Mainly you and him.

13:58.752 --> 14:00.619
[laughter]

14:00.931 --> 14:02.792
"Mystery Science Theater,"
everybody must know

14:02.817 --> 14:03.799
what it is at this point.

14:03.824 --> 14:06.192
Maybe younger kids don't, man,
but the premise of the show

14:06.217 --> 14:08.267
was like, this dude Joel was trapped

14:08.292 --> 14:10.718
on the "Satellite of
Love" by two mad scientists

14:10.743 --> 14:13.067
and that he was forced to
watch these terrible movies,

14:13.092 --> 14:15.300
so in an effort to not go crazy,

14:15.325 --> 14:17.569
he built robot friends and they would do

14:17.594 --> 14:19.199
what they called riffing on the movie.

14:19.224 --> 14:21.426
The same things everybody does
with their friends, probably.

14:21.451 --> 14:22.504
I love the show.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.230
I mean, I've always, uh,
been drawn to bad movies.

14:25.556 --> 14:27.556
- And robots.
- And robots.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.359
I mean, it's an irresistible
combination for me.

14:30.461 --> 14:32.995
The way I always heard
the story was Joel Hodgson

14:33.097 --> 14:35.364
who created the show came out to L.A.

14:35.466 --> 14:37.700
and they gave him a sitcom deal

14:37.802 --> 14:39.735
to do a sitcom with Michael J. Fox

14:39.837 --> 14:43.005
and so as they were developing
it, he was just like,

14:43.107 --> 14:45.474
"I'm sorry, this is simply not funny,"

14:45.576 --> 14:49.011
and left the business
and went back to Minnesota

14:49.113 --> 14:51.514
and that's where he created
"Mystery Science Theater,"

14:51.616 --> 14:53.716
and that put him on the
map in a big, bad way.

14:53.818 --> 14:55.050
Smart guys, too.

14:55.153 --> 14:56.621
I mean, there's endless bad movies.

14:56.646 --> 14:57.920
Yeah, I mean, they're gonna...

14:57.945 --> 14:59.304
there's gonna be another
season, thankfully.

14:59.329 --> 15:00.089
Yes, that's right.

15:00.114 --> 15:01.539
There's going to be a new host.

15:01.564 --> 15:02.171
What do you think about that?

15:02.196 --> 15:03.259
Yeah, Jonah Ray.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.660
I... I think he can do it.

15:04.762 --> 15:06.195
I... I actually got to see him live.

15:06.297 --> 15:07.764
Like, actually riff.

15:07.789 --> 15:10.109
I can't believe they tapped
Jonah Ray and not you.

15:10.134 --> 15:11.901
[laughter]

15:11.926 --> 15:13.579
I-I-I know, I'm still
waiting for my phone call.

15:13.604 --> 15:14.982
Show her some of your skills on riffing.

15:15.007 --> 15:15.905
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Go for it.

15:15.930 --> 15:17.613
Do the scene where, like, Luke Skywalker

15:17.638 --> 15:19.041
is training with the helmet on.

15:19.143 --> 15:21.076
Look at him. Look it... this is awful.

15:21.179 --> 15:23.434
No wonder he wears that
mask. He's so ugly. Awful.

15:23.459 --> 15:26.048
[laughter]

15:26.073 --> 15:27.673
Yeah, I think my riffing
skills are pretty good.

15:27.852 --> 15:30.566
I think, yeah, I... you
know... I... I'm, you know,

15:30.591 --> 15:31.550
I'm not a professional. [laughter]

15:31.575 --> 15:33.088
Listen to that riffing right there.

15:33.191 --> 15:35.524
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, you know."

15:35.626 --> 15:38.561
[laughter]

15:39.897 --> 15:41.515
All right, so the Tom Servo piece.

15:41.540 --> 15:42.965
I mean, it's beautiful.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.632
It's got the string, you can
make the mouth move, right?

15:45.657 --> 15:47.837
- I'm only $400.
- [laughter]

15:47.862 --> 15:48.971
Does that sound like Servo?

15:49.333 --> 15:50.860
- It's pretty close.
- [laughter]

15:50.885 --> 15:52.858
- I'd say yes.
- Yeah. Yeah.

15:52.883 --> 15:56.445
I really wasn't looking
to spend that much today.

15:56.547 --> 15:59.782
Would you be able to maybe do $250?

15:59.884 --> 16:02.484
Oh. $250.

16:02.587 --> 16:03.752
I couldn't go that low.

16:03.854 --> 16:05.621
I could knock a couple
bucks off, though.

16:05.723 --> 16:08.440
How about, um, $350?

16:08.465 --> 16:12.734
$350? Could you do $300?

16:12.839 --> 16:14.073
I know you... I can tell you love it

16:14.098 --> 16:15.328
and we can smell our own.

16:15.353 --> 16:17.253
Um, I'll let it go for $300.

16:17.350 --> 16:18.950
Thank you.

16:19.207 --> 16:20.346
Pleasure. Thank you.

16:20.371 --> 16:21.403
- Thank you.
- Enjoy it.

16:21.505 --> 16:23.760
I will. Thank you guys.

16:23.785 --> 16:26.319
There she goes, another
satisfied customer.

16:26.344 --> 16:27.843
Don't let the door
hit you on the way out.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.411
- Wow.
- What was that about?

16:29.513 --> 16:30.946
Was that... was that...
was that your riffing?

16:31.048 --> 16:32.314
- That was my riffing, yeah.
- That was a riff?

16:32.416 --> 16:33.916
That... come on, bro,
you got to up your game.

16:34.018 --> 16:35.651
Yeah, up it like how?

16:35.753 --> 16:36.685
Like, say something funny.

16:36.804 --> 16:38.689
[laughter]

16:38.714 --> 16:40.866
How'd you like a present from Elvira?

16:40.899 --> 16:45.667
Something just for you
'cause I know what you like.

16:45.692 --> 16:46.691
You do?

16:50.880 --> 16:52.265
Come on over. Register this way.

16:52.367 --> 16:53.266
Hi, how are you?

16:53.291 --> 16:54.744
- How are you?
- Gave you the discount.

16:54.769 --> 16:56.176
Thank you. Thanks for donating.

16:56.201 --> 16:58.266
You come back when you're all
grown up and give blood, okay?

16:58.291 --> 16:58.915
All right.

16:58.940 --> 17:00.339
You did a wonderful
thing today. Thank you.

17:00.364 --> 17:02.252
Sit right here. Pretend
like you like me.

17:02.277 --> 17:03.543
All right. Right this way, guys.

17:03.645 --> 17:04.805
Thank you. Thank you.

17:04.829 --> 17:05.510
Thanks for donating.

17:05.535 --> 17:06.746
- Next.
- Yeah, come on over here.

17:06.848 --> 17:07.867
Hi, how are you?

17:07.893 --> 17:10.492
Both blood and cash are flowing.

17:10.518 --> 17:11.751
Ooh, sounds like a rap song.

17:11.853 --> 17:12.785
[laughter]

17:12.887 --> 17:13.963
That's amazing.

17:13.988 --> 17:16.199
We got people going
into the bloodmobile,

17:16.223 --> 17:18.290
coming out of the bloodmobile
right into the Stash,

17:18.393 --> 17:21.194
meeting Elvira, buying merchandise.

17:21.296 --> 17:22.962
It was a great day.

17:23.064 --> 17:25.297
Did you wonder at any point,
though, like, people give blood,

17:25.321 --> 17:26.413
they're a little bit lightheaded,

17:26.438 --> 17:27.424
they're a little bit woozy,

17:27.449 --> 17:28.812
and then they just wander into the Stash

17:28.837 --> 17:30.347
and start spending money
and maybe they're not sure

17:30.372 --> 17:31.271
what they're doing?

17:31.373 --> 17:32.272
[laughter]

17:32.610 --> 17:33.809
Caveat emptor.

17:33.834 --> 17:36.109
[laughter]

17:36.211 --> 17:37.110
Hi, how are you?

17:37.212 --> 17:38.378
Good, how are you?

17:38.480 --> 17:39.779
Did you guys both donate blood?

17:39.881 --> 17:42.166
Oh no, I'm here for moral support.

17:42.191 --> 17:44.417
Well, I'll just sign half
of your comic book then.

17:44.519 --> 17:46.445
You should go hang out
with Walt over there.

17:46.470 --> 17:47.497
[laughter]

17:47.522 --> 17:49.015
Thanks for coming down, you guys.

17:49.040 --> 17:49.822
Thank you. It was nice to meet you.

17:49.925 --> 17:51.257
Bye. Hey.

17:51.359 --> 17:52.558
Thanks... thanks for
donating. Right this way.

17:52.661 --> 17:53.637
Elvira in the Secret Stash.

17:53.662 --> 17:54.627
This is exciting.

17:54.652 --> 17:55.979
Whoa, you donated blood, I see?

17:56.004 --> 17:57.877
- I did.
- Fantastic.

17:57.902 --> 18:00.179
Looks like everybody's
pretty much giving blood.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.398
Oh, you know, I can't hear
what you're saying, Elvira.

18:02.423 --> 18:04.547
- Except some people.
- I can't hear a thing.

18:04.572 --> 18:05.704
Huh, what was that?

18:05.729 --> 18:07.837
Some of us are men around here.

18:07.862 --> 18:10.320
Some of us aren't. Anyway, Bye.

18:10.345 --> 18:11.748
I don't appreciate the blood-shaming

18:11.773 --> 18:13.108
that's going on here today, Elvira.

18:13.133 --> 18:13.980
[laughs]

18:14.082 --> 18:15.248
Thank you. Thank you for giving.

18:15.350 --> 18:16.684
- Right this way.
- Hey, how are you?

18:16.709 --> 18:20.006
You're not even acknowledging
the courage it takes

18:20.201 --> 18:21.453
to give a discount.

18:21.478 --> 18:24.347
Ha! Thanks, Chad. Great to meet you.

18:24.372 --> 18:26.971
- Yeah, you're a hero all right.
- Bye.

18:27.028 --> 18:29.296
Throughout the day I was doing my best

18:29.321 --> 18:30.293
to... to get him to give blood.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.418
I thought I would get him to crack.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.838
Elvira was doing her best.

18:32.863 --> 18:35.414
We were putting the...
the blood pressure on you.

18:35.439 --> 18:37.214
Ah, nice.

18:37.239 --> 18:38.271
You know I'm immune to that.

18:38.373 --> 18:40.249
Blood or peer pressure
doesn't work on me.

18:40.274 --> 18:41.320
[laughter]

18:41.345 --> 18:42.477
They tell you in high school,

18:42.502 --> 18:43.757
"Kids, look out for the peer pressure,"

18:43.782 --> 18:45.724
but they never tell you about
that deadly blood pressure.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.316
- [laughter]
- Not in high school.

18:48.717 --> 18:51.295
Wow, man, I saw smoke
coming out of that register.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.820
Looks like you were doing
pretty darn good there, Walt.

18:53.922 --> 18:55.855
We were. A lot of
plasma was moved today.

18:55.880 --> 18:59.083
Yeah, fantastic. Except
maybe, uh, yours, huh?

18:59.108 --> 19:00.719
No, not mine. But still.

19:00.744 --> 19:02.706
- Yeah, I know. I noticed.
- Still a great day.

19:02.731 --> 19:03.863
Well, how did it go?

19:03.965 --> 19:05.465
Gave.

19:05.567 --> 19:07.017
These are what real men look like.

19:07.042 --> 19:08.901
Look. Wow, congratulations you guys.

19:09.004 --> 19:10.611
You can't shame me, Elvira. You can't.

19:10.636 --> 19:11.485
- I can't?
- Nope.

19:11.510 --> 19:14.590
Well, if I can't shame
you, how about I give you

19:14.615 --> 19:16.743
a little incentive?

19:16.768 --> 19:17.570
Incentive?

19:17.595 --> 19:21.672
How'd you like a really
special present from Elvira?

19:21.697 --> 19:23.893
Something else just for you

19:23.918 --> 19:26.819
'cause I know what you like.

19:26.921 --> 19:27.820
You do?

19:27.922 --> 19:29.155
Yeah, just a second.

19:29.257 --> 19:30.156
I can give more blood.

19:30.258 --> 19:31.491
- [laughter]
- Yeah, seriously.

19:31.516 --> 19:35.127
My brand-new coffin table book.

19:35.152 --> 19:36.068
Oh, man.

19:36.093 --> 19:37.957
If you give blood, it's yours.

19:37.982 --> 19:38.596
Really?

19:38.621 --> 19:40.276
Uh-huh. It's hot off the press.

19:40.301 --> 19:41.401
Would you sign it?

19:41.503 --> 19:43.709
I will sign it, I'll sit on it.

19:43.734 --> 19:44.959
Whatever you want me to do.

19:44.984 --> 19:45.883
Sign it in blood?

19:45.908 --> 19:47.918
Good idea. Absolutely.

19:47.943 --> 19:48.707
All right.

19:48.732 --> 19:50.236
Everyone else just got a sticker.

19:50.261 --> 19:51.844
[laughter]

19:51.946 --> 19:53.546
That seems not right to me.

19:54.038 --> 19:55.348
- Deal.
- Okay!

19:55.450 --> 19:56.582
- We're doing it.
- All right.

19:56.684 --> 19:59.118
Awesome. I know what Walt likes.

19:59.609 --> 20:00.775
- Free stuff.
- Yeah.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.736
Yeah, free stuff.

20:01.761 --> 20:03.428
You... you guys should
have held out for more.

20:04.090 --> 20:05.422
Oh, maybe I shouldn't give it to him.

20:05.447 --> 20:08.088
Maybe I should just
give him a 20% discount.

20:08.113 --> 20:08.861
[laughter]

20:08.963 --> 20:10.930
Boom.

20:11.032 --> 20:13.839
All right, let's go. Let's go, big boy.

20:13.864 --> 20:14.856
It's not gonna hurt, right?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.802
No, no, no, doesn't hurt. It's fun.

20:16.827 --> 20:18.420
You're gonna love it.

20:18.445 --> 20:19.772
- Fun?
- You did it?

20:19.874 --> 20:22.074
Dracula himself gave up blood?

20:22.099 --> 20:23.042
Right there.

20:23.144 --> 20:25.416
Stuck it in, I gave what I had to give.

20:25.441 --> 20:26.245
It feels good.

20:26.347 --> 20:28.281
It sounds like they stuck it in here,

20:28.383 --> 20:30.348
but it sounds like she
stuck it in the heart, man,

20:30.373 --> 20:33.052
'cause she got you to give up
the blood in the first place.

20:33.077 --> 20:35.475
Actually, no, it would
be more my backside

20:35.500 --> 20:36.230
where my wallet is

20:36.255 --> 20:37.867
'cause I'm gonna flip
that book that she gave me.

20:37.892 --> 20:39.934
- Smart, man. Smart.
- [laughter]

20:39.959 --> 20:41.161
You're like, "The way to a man's heart

20:41.186 --> 20:42.727
is through his wallet
in his back pocket."

20:42.752 --> 20:45.431
[laughter]

20:45.533 --> 20:47.955
That's all the time we
got for this week, man.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.850
For "Comic Book Men," I'm Kevin Smith.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.603
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:51.628 --> 20:52.939
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:53.041 --> 20:56.742
And like they say on Krypton,
kids, blood bonds us all.

20:57.126 --> 20:58.437
Good night.
