00:00.883 --> 00:03.017
<i>u missed
on Glee: The Glee Club started
out as underdogs,</i>

00:03.069 --> 00:04.552
<i>singing show tunes in the choir
room, and now they're headed
to Chicago</i>

00:04.603 --> 00:06.387
<i>to compete for a national
championship.</i>

00:06.439 --> 00:08.323
<i>I mean, they made it
to Nationals last year
in New York,</i>

00:08.390 --> 00:09.908
<i>but they came in 12th.
It was sort of a nightmare.</i>

00:09.992 --> 00:12.110
<i>Rachel's nightmare totally
came true when she choked</i>

00:12.194 --> 00:14.729
<i>at her NYADA audition,
and literally all she's talked</i>

00:14.780 --> 00:16.614
<i>about for three years is New
York, Broadway, Streisand,
Broadway.</i>

00:16.699 --> 00:18.066
<i>Ugh!
And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

00:20.569 --> 00:21.619
(beeping)

00:21.704 --> 00:23.288
What's going on?
How bad is it?

00:23.372 --> 00:25.072
Her temperature's 101 degrees.

00:25.124 --> 00:27.459
Given the fact that Weezy's
complaining

00:27.543 --> 00:29.010
about an upset stomach,

00:29.077 --> 00:31.913
it's either Amazonian dengue
fever or the H1N1 super virus.

00:31.964 --> 00:33.381
Or I have
food poisoning.

00:33.432 --> 00:35.717
We all wanted burritos for
lunch, so we went to Chipotle,

00:35.768 --> 00:39.304
but Mercedes tried some dive
called "Señora Salsation."

00:39.388 --> 00:40.555
Will, word, please.

00:40.606 --> 00:42.590
With Monique down
for the count,

00:42.641 --> 00:45.593
<i>we are entering
the Hunger Games of
show choir competition</i>

00:45.644 --> 00:47.312
without one of our most
powerful voices.

00:47.396 --> 00:48.763
We need to have a plan.

00:48.814 --> 00:50.097
Right. Because New Directions!
doesn't win,

00:50.149 --> 00:51.766
that means you go back
to being co-captains

00:51.817 --> 00:53.067
of the Cheerios! with
Roz Washington.

00:53.119 --> 00:55.620
Your sniping is as expository
as it is wrong.

00:55.704 --> 00:58.206
Yes, I have fantasized
about handing that prize money

00:58.273 --> 01:01.576
to Principal Figgins
so I could buy back my sole
control of the Cheerios!,

01:01.627 --> 01:04.629
but my main concern right now
is for these kids.

01:04.712 --> 01:06.748
I want this one for them.

01:06.799 --> 01:09.450
I just don't want everything
we worked for to collapse

01:09.502 --> 01:11.219
because of one bad burrito.

01:11.286 --> 01:13.755
So here's what's gonna happen:
Mercedes, you're on bed rest,

01:13.806 --> 01:15.640
Quinn, you're stepping in.
No, no, no, I can't

01:15.724 --> 01:18.143
dance that number. I can't sing
it, either, not like...

01:18.227 --> 01:19.627
The Trouble Tones need you.

01:19.678 --> 01:20.812
And you're better than you
think you are.

01:20.896 --> 01:22.096
Tina, you, too.
You're in the Trouble Tones.

01:22.148 --> 01:23.464
Mr. Shue, this is my last
competition.

01:23.516 --> 01:24.966
I don't want to miss it.

01:25.017 --> 01:26.684
Amen, to that, sister.
That's why I'm putting you

01:26.769 --> 01:27.902
on a vitamin B-12 drip.

01:27.970 --> 01:29.103
We're flushing your system

01:29.155 --> 01:30.572
with Pedialyte, and I'm gonna

01:30.639 --> 01:33.391
fill that bathtub with ice
and see if we can't get

01:33.459 --> 01:35.109
your ambient body temperature
back down to normal.

01:35.161 --> 01:36.327
<i>Worked in Jacob's Ladder.</i>

01:36.412 --> 01:37.979
All right, we all have
our marching orders.

01:38.030 --> 01:38.830
Let's do it.

01:42.001 --> 01:43.835
Hey.

01:43.919 --> 01:45.420
You okay?

01:45.487 --> 01:49.657
What if we don't win? What's
gonna happen with those kids?

01:49.708 --> 01:51.042
It's a competition.

01:51.126 --> 01:53.595
They understand
that everybody can't win.

01:53.662 --> 01:55.346
But they never get to win.

01:55.431 --> 01:58.716
School's almost over,
forever for most of them.

01:58.801 --> 02:01.936
Can you imagine what
what it would be like
for them

02:02.004 --> 02:04.355
to have just a couple
of days walking the halls
as champions?

02:04.440 --> 02:06.941
It's something
they would carry
around with them

02:07.009 --> 02:08.359
for the rest
of their lives.

02:08.443 --> 02:10.562
If you're gonna lead
them to the promised land,

02:10.645 --> 02:12.363
you're gonna have
to have an attitude
adjustment.

02:12.448 --> 02:13.398
(sighs)
But, Will,
they're ready.

02:13.482 --> 02:15.233
You made 'em ready
for three years.

02:18.070 --> 02:20.154
But what if it wasn't enough?

02:22.291 --> 02:23.658
Will, you better
come downstairs.

02:23.709 --> 02:24.909
We got a problem.

02:26.545 --> 02:28.880
(kids yelling)

02:28.964 --> 02:32.634
Hey, calm down!
Hey, hey, calm down! Calm down!

02:32.701 --> 02:33.835
Fight, fight, fight!

02:33.886 --> 02:35.003
Hey, cool out!

02:35.054 --> 02:36.304
He's studying
for geography

02:36.371 --> 02:37.305
while we're trying
to rehearse! It's bogus!

02:37.372 --> 02:38.756
'Cause I already
know the dance!

02:38.841 --> 02:40.558
You dance like you
got your feet caught
in bear traps.

02:40.643 --> 02:42.376
You're trying
to gnaw them off.

02:42.428 --> 02:44.229
Mr. Shue, are you aware
that while we're arguing
about jazz squares,

02:44.313 --> 02:47.565
Unique is being handed the key
to the city by Rahm Emanuel?
Really?

02:47.650 --> 02:50.318
And plus my pillow and my
blanket fell into the pool.
Disaster.

02:50.385 --> 02:52.553
Look, I think everybody is
just a little tired.

02:52.605 --> 02:54.072
We've been rehearsing
for three straight hours.

02:54.156 --> 02:55.773
Yeah, and we'll rehearse
all night if we have to.

02:55.858 --> 02:56.691
We can rest after we've won!

02:56.742 --> 02:58.225
Just because we've lost Mercedes

02:58.277 --> 03:01.529
doesn't mean we can be anything
less than perfect. Perfect!

03:01.580 --> 03:02.830
That's easy for you to say.

03:02.898 --> 03:04.866
Okay, you know what?
You know what?

03:04.917 --> 03:08.169
Hey! I don't want
to hear any of this,
"We can't do it without her,"

03:08.236 --> 03:10.255
because guess what?
We don't have a choice.

03:10.339 --> 03:12.707
So be warned:
if you are not giving this

03:12.758 --> 03:14.425
everything you've got,

03:14.510 --> 03:17.211
I will go all
Lima Heights on
your sorry asses.

03:17.263 --> 03:18.346
Listen to yourselves.

03:18.413 --> 03:20.048
I know. I'm sorry.
I always go

03:20.099 --> 03:21.933
to the yelling place.
I have rage.

03:22.017 --> 03:26.054
No, it's a good thing.
A great thing.

03:26.105 --> 03:28.422
There is so much passion
in this room

03:28.474 --> 03:31.092
Even all your arguing,
it's about the work.

03:31.143 --> 03:32.894
You guys really wanthis.

03:32.945 --> 03:34.896
Okay, so let's take
a half-hour break,

03:34.947 --> 03:36.648
and then we'll run it
from the top.

03:36.732 --> 03:38.816
Mr. Shue, is it okay
if we keep going? We got

03:38.901 --> 03:39.767
the first slot,
which is, like, the death slot.

03:39.818 --> 03:41.069
We have to be amazing.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.453
Yeah, "Edge of Glory's"
a bitch.

03:42.538 --> 03:43.771
I said I'd be dancing
by nationals.

03:43.822 --> 03:45.039
I'll be damned if I don't.

03:45.107 --> 03:46.273
Okay, then let's
keep going.

03:46.325 --> 03:47.775
Mike, help the guys out
with the choreography.

03:47.826 --> 03:49.410
Artie, help Puck
with his geography.

03:49.461 --> 03:51.212
Ladies, "Edge of Glory."
Come on.

03:51.279 --> 03:52.630
Brittany, run us through it.

03:52.715 --> 03:54.832
From the chorus?
Yeah, from the chorus.
Let's do it.

03:54.917 --> 03:57.418
Watch out. We're gonna
do it. Okay. Ready?

03:57.469 --> 03:58.670
Five, six,
seven, eight.

03:58.754 --> 04:01.255
One, two, three, four, five...

04:01.307 --> 04:02.223
You okay?

04:02.290 --> 04:03.624
...six, seven, eight.

04:03.676 --> 04:05.727
One, two, three, four...

04:05.794 --> 04:06.928
Keep up.

04:12.434 --> 04:15.320
Looking for what's left
of your dignity?

04:15.404 --> 04:17.805
Nice to see you, too, Jessie.

04:17.856 --> 04:20.141
If I were you, I'd be
spending more time fing

04:20.192 --> 04:21.826
on how you're gonna wrap up
fourth place

04:21.910 --> 04:23.277
than looking for her.

04:23.329 --> 04:25.312
There's no way in hell
Carmen Tibideaux's coming here.

04:25.364 --> 04:26.664
Wait. How do you know
about Carmen?

04:26.749 --> 04:27.865
It's my business
to know everything

04:27.950 --> 04:29.000
that goes on with
my competition.

04:29.084 --> 04:30.651
I'm always looking
for that extra edge.

04:30.703 --> 04:33.171
I hate to think
you pull the same
choke job up there today.

04:33.255 --> 04:35.206
Look, I know exactly what
you're doing right now, okay?

04:35.290 --> 04:36.824
We didn't date for that long,

04:36.875 --> 04:39.326
and I don't even know how much
of it was actually real,

04:39.378 --> 04:41.129
but when you get nervous,
you get mean

04:41.196 --> 04:43.381
and you get really pale,
and then you start putting
your hands

04:43.465 --> 04:44.849
through your hair
like Danny Zuko.

04:44.933 --> 04:47.185
Look, you have no idea
the kind of pressure
I'm under.

04:47.269 --> 04:50.521
Last year, Vocal Adrenaline
only lost for the first time
in eight years.

04:50.606 --> 04:53.507
If we lose again
this year, that's it.
The dynasty is over.

04:53.559 --> 04:57.395
The mystique and aura
that we used to intimidate
our opponents with will vanish.

04:57.479 --> 05:00.698
I promised them that
I would reboot the program.
I'll be humiliated.

05:00.783 --> 05:02.066
You did help the program.

05:02.151 --> 05:03.517
What you did with
Unique was amazing.

05:03.569 --> 05:05.787
It was a pretty
inspired idea of mine.

05:05.854 --> 05:08.156
It was actually Kurt's
and Mercedes', but...

05:08.207 --> 05:10.742
But I implemented it.

05:10.826 --> 05:12.860
I don't know. I just think
these new rules are

05:12.911 --> 05:15.997
messing with my head; 33%

05:16.048 --> 05:18.800
of the numbers have
to be vintage? What does
that even mean?

05:18.867 --> 05:21.552
The only thing vintage
about me is my Tyrone Powers
haircut and my pager.

05:21.637 --> 05:23.671
Are you forgetting who you are,
Jesse, okay?

05:23.722 --> 05:25.840
<i>Your Bohemian Rhapsody was,
like, the benchmark performance</i>

05:25.891 --> 05:28.593
of every show choir
competition in the
past ten years.

05:28.677 --> 05:30.428
Most people don't realize

05:30.512 --> 05:32.146
I lost ten pounds
during that performance.

05:32.214 --> 05:33.514
You guys are
gonna do great today.

05:33.565 --> 05:36.234
Even though we're
definitely gonna beat you.

05:36.318 --> 05:38.569
Oh, cocky all of a sudden.

05:38.654 --> 05:40.354
I like it.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.889
Hey, everything okay?

05:41.940 --> 05:44.659
Yeah, everything's good.
I'm gonna go get ready.

05:44.726 --> 05:46.778
It was very good to see you.
You, too.

05:46.862 --> 05:49.247
Hi.

05:49.331 --> 05:50.397
Heard you two are getting
married.

05:50.449 --> 05:52.233
Yeah.

05:52.284 --> 05:55.169
Good for you.

05:55.237 --> 05:58.256
Good luck today.

05:58.340 --> 05:59.290
You, too.

06:04.179 --> 06:07.181
For me?
Well, it's for the wedding.

06:07.249 --> 06:10.084
For the Jewish part
where you smash the glass.
It'ske, the climax

06:10.135 --> 06:11.519
of the wedding, right?
Right before we kiss?

06:11.586 --> 06:13.070
Yeah, it's supposed to symbolize
the fragility of life

06:13.138 --> 06:14.722
or the destruction of the temple

06:14.773 --> 06:16.590
or something like that.
It's very sweet.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:16.642 --> 06:19.477
But whatever. I wanted
a piece of this town
to be there.

06:19.561 --> 06:21.279
This is the town where
everything's gonna change.

06:21.363 --> 06:23.564
We're gonna go from losers
to National Champs.

06:23.615 --> 06:26.150
Your optimism if very sexy.

06:26.235 --> 06:29.237
Well, I'm so optimistic, I put
my money where my mouth is.

06:29.288 --> 06:30.905
You want to bet me

06:30.956 --> 06:32.907
that your dork club is gonna
outdork all the other

06:32.958 --> 06:34.392
dork clubs
in the country?

06:34.460 --> 06:35.710
500 bucks.

06:35.777 --> 06:37.662
You're so on.

06:37.746 --> 06:39.464
Wait a minute.
That money was supposed

06:39.548 --> 06:40.965
to be for our honeymoon, okay?

06:41.049 --> 06:43.334
It was our money that we saved
from babysitting

06:43.418 --> 06:45.253
and the tips you made
at the tire shop!

06:45.304 --> 06:47.588
I'm gonna double it. I'm gonna
make it a thousand dollars.

06:47.639 --> 06:49.623
That's, like, an extra
two nights in Niagara Falls.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.175
What if we lose?
Not this time.

06:51.260 --> 06:54.428
Carmen Tibideaux is coming,
and we're gonna be perfect.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.397
And then we're
gonna get married,

06:56.464 --> 06:57.815
and I'm gonna smash this glass,

06:57.900 --> 06:59.317
and then we're gonna live
happily ever after.

07:01.019 --> 07:02.136
I love you.

07:10.812 --> 07:11.946
All right, gather around,
everyone!

07:11.997 --> 07:13.314
(kids cheer)

07:13.365 --> 07:16.334
I just want to say a few words
before we go out there.

07:16.418 --> 07:18.536
Hold on, Mr. Shue. Hold on.
You've given us

07:18.620 --> 07:20.922
a lot of pep talks
over the years, but remember,

07:20.989 --> 07:22.540
you told us once
that, you know,

07:22.624 --> 07:27.328
a teacher's job is done when his
students don't need him anymore?

07:27.379 --> 07:32.133
Okay. Finn, the floor is yours.

07:32.184 --> 07:34.302
Last night we all sat around
in a circle

07:34.353 --> 07:36.337
after you went to bed
and we told stories.

07:36.388 --> 07:38.105
But then we went around
the room,

07:38.173 --> 07:40.691
and everybody said what they
wanted to win this thing for,

07:40.776 --> 07:42.560
and we all said the same thing:

07:42.644 --> 07:44.946
we want to win this for you.
Yeah.

07:45.013 --> 07:47.231
And I know every year at school
Figgins gives away

07:47.316 --> 07:50.017
the Teacher of the Year award.

07:50.068 --> 07:52.453
But I don't think
any of us have to wait

07:52.520 --> 07:54.521
to see how we feel about that.

07:54.573 --> 07:57.241
You're, like, our
Teacher of a Lifetime.

07:57.326 --> 07:58.209
GIRL:
Yeah.

07:58.293 --> 08:00.244
Whoo!
Yeah, definitely.

08:00.329 --> 08:02.529
Thank you, Finn, all of you.

and give her this flower

19:06.069 --> 19:10.020
Well, Unique has left the building.
Try as I might, I can't conjure her.

19:10.024 --> 19:13.756
Wait, this is just stage fright. Think of the
last time you performed as Unique. You were smash.

19:13.757 --> 19:17.912
That was different. Nobody knew Unique. I didn't
have to be any one other than the one I truly was.

19:18.552 --> 19:21.107
Now everyone is coming for me. 
Jesse, the rest of my team, 

19:21.288 --> 19:24.761

a dress and sing.

19:39.266 --> 19:43.646

I can't handle it... I just can't handle it.

19:39.056 --> 19:41.406
You may not be able to handle it, 
but maybe Unique can.

19:41.980 --> 19:46.957
You gotta move through that fear and expectation.
At least that's what real stars do.

19:53.853 --> 20:00.853

-Yeah, but that's not how we roll in the New Directions.

25:28.482 --> 25:30.583
I am a show choir junkie.

25:30.651 --> 25:31.951
Some people
follow football;

25:32.002 --> 25:34.820
some people follow the NCAA

some people follow
the daily goings-on

wife and children.

25:38.375 --> 25:41.544
Not me. I follow competitive
high school show choir.

25:41.629 --> 25:43.346
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, my God!

25:43.430 --> 25:45.665
Seriously?
Did you blog just about me

25:45.716 --> 25:46.666
during that performance?

25:49.386 --> 25:51.638
You're welcome. It's already
got over three million hits.

25:51.689 --> 25:54.507
And secondly,
if you don't love show choir,

25:54.558 --> 25:57.009
then what exactly are you
doing here, Lindsay Lohan?

25:57.061 --> 25:58.194
If you have to ask

25:58.279 --> 26:01.064
why a 12-time Teen Choice Award
nominee

26:01.148 --> 26:02.782
is a celebrity judge,

26:02.849 --> 26:05.785

what the word celebrity means.

Freaky Friday.</i>

26:07.371 --> 26:08.571
And I'm here, Perez,

26:08.656 --> 26:10.573
because I care
about young artists

26:10.658 --> 26:12.191

26:12.243 --> 26:13.376
I know them.

26:47.778 --> 26:49.412
They didn't even
crack the top ten.

26:49.496 --> 26:52.732

the best singers and dancers.

not even a red button to push?

spin me around?

27:34.908 --> 27:37.710
Or I can then point
at a kid onstage and yell,
"I would work with you!"

27:37.778 --> 27:40.463
Really? I'm seriously
firing my manager.

27:40.547 --> 27:41.497

Hi.

38:45.688 --> 38:48.723
The 2012 William
McKinley High School

38:48.808 --> 38:50.525
Teacher of the Year Award
goes to...

38:53.613 --> 38:55.030
Mr. Will Schuester!

38:55.114 --> 38:57.065
Yeah!
(cheering)

39:01.070 --> 39:02.520
Way to go, buddy.

39:07.293 --> 39:08.743
Wait, just, uh...

39:08.828 --> 39:10.795
before you come up
to accept the award,

39:10.863 --> 39:12.831
we just wanted
to say a few things.

39:12.882 --> 39:14.716
Uh...

39:16.135 --> 39:19.421
Three years ago,
I thought I had it all.

39:19.505 --> 39:21.589
I was the quarterback of
the football team,

39:21.674 --> 39:23.642
I was dating
the head cheerleader.

39:23.709 --> 39:25.677
And then I met you, Mr. Shue,

39:25.728 --> 39:27.228
and I realized
everything I was missing.

39:27.313 --> 39:31.316
There's a lot of great teachers
at this school,

39:31.383 --> 39:33.685
who teach their students
a lot of important stuff,

39:33.736 --> 39:35.103
like how to drive
and-and fractions...

39:39.275 --> 39:43.078
...but you teach your students
how to dream.

39:43.162 --> 39:44.395
As far as I'm concerned,

39:44.447 --> 39:45.780
there's nothing more
important than that.

39:52.271 --> 39:54.472
Mr. Shue...

39:54.540 --> 39:55.974
when I first met you,

39:56.042 --> 39:57.642
I was just an
annoying Jewish girl

39:57.710 --> 39:59.477
with two gay dads
and a very big dream.

39:59.545 --> 40:01.997
Today...

40:02.064 --> 40:04.683
I still have two dads,
and I'm still Jewish,

40:04.750 --> 40:07.886
and I'm probably
just as annoying, but...

40:07.937 --> 40:11.473
I stand before you
headed to New York City

40:11.557 --> 40:12.924
come hell or high water

40:12.975 --> 40:15.226
and, um, I can honestly say

40:15.277 --> 40:16.895
that I couldn't have
done it without you,

40:16.946 --> 40:21.265
and I will carry you
every step of the way, so...

40:21.317 --> 40:23.034
Congratulations.

40:23.102 --> 40:24.452
Um... no one deserves this
more than you.

40:24.537 --> 40:26.938
We love you and...

40:26.989 --> 40:29.040
(sniffles):
this is for you.
