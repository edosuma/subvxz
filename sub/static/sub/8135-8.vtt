00:02.202 --> 00:04.295
Michael, he's coming right at us.

00:04.371 --> 00:06.703
I can see that.
Do something.

00:08.173 --> 00:11.610
Put him in the squad.
You're not serious.

00:11.678 --> 00:15.444
- Where's Devon? - Your friend was
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

00:16.649 --> 00:19.117
Oh, my God!

00:19.185 --> 00:21.153
Where are we going?

00:21.221 --> 00:23.212
To save Michael.

00:25.658 --> 00:27.922
Don't let him cross
that county line.

00:42.742 --> 00:47.907
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:47.981 --> 00:49.972
who does not exist.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.984
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.062 --> 01:04.587
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.664 --> 01:07.690
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:07.767 --> 01:11.259
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.968
Pull over.

02:57.210 --> 03:00.873
- Hey, rich car.
- This guy should be good for some big bucks.

03:10.456 --> 03:13.619
Your driver's license?

03:13.693 --> 03:16.753
What seems to be the problem, Officer?
I was going to ask you that.

03:16.829 --> 03:19.229
You got a burr up your muffler?

03:19.299 --> 03:23.065
- I beg your pardon? - You ran through
a posted intersection without stopping.

03:28.975 --> 03:32.308
- I don't wish to tell you your business,
Officer... - Then don't.

03:32.378 --> 03:36.337
But that sign is not
legally posted; it's hidden.

03:36.416 --> 03:39.112
You want to write up
the vehicle, Rex?

03:39.185 --> 03:41.619
Right, Sarge.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.064
You broke that light.
You'll pay for it.

03:55.134 --> 03:58.467
Me? Never touched it.

03:58.538 --> 04:01.735
A broken taillight,
running a stop,

04:01.808 --> 04:04.174
failure to produce license.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.611
You're running up quite a fine.
Which I have no intention of paying.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.207
That stop sign is nothing
but a poorly concealed trap.

04:11.284 --> 04:14.651
I think he's trying
to tell us that we set him up.

04:14.721 --> 04:16.689
Crudely put, but accurate.

04:16.755 --> 04:20.783
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll see if I
can find a lawyer to deal with this matter.

04:20.860 --> 04:25.024
- That'll come later. Let's put him in the squad.
- You're not serious.

05:38.171 --> 05:42.403
We're making real good time, buddy. We
should be at the Foundation in about an hour.

05:42.475 --> 05:46.878
I'm afraid there'll be a slight delay. I'm
going to have to make a pit stop very shortly.

05:46.946 --> 05:50.109
Pit stop? Quit kidding around.
You're not that human.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.777
I was using the term
in its literal sense, Michael.

05:52.852 --> 05:57.289
If you'll glance at my fuel gauges, you'll
see that I'm virtually operating on fumes.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.793
Boy, you're right. Bonnie really
goofed up this time, didn't she?

06:00.860 --> 06:03.556
It wasn't Bonnie's fault.
It's just that her route plan...

06:03.629 --> 06:05.859
didn't include the 200-mile diversion...

06:05.932 --> 06:08.423
involving you and that young lady
you met back in...

06:08.501 --> 06:12.130
Yeah. Never mind that.
I'll find you some blood, Dracula.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.140
A very inept analogy,
if I may say so.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.234
Blood has virtually
no combustible capabilities at all.

06:27.086 --> 06:31.819
Now remember, Michael, my synthesizers can
operate on any kind of combustible fluids.

06:31.891 --> 06:35.383
That's some kind of car, Mother.

06:35.461 --> 06:39.295
Oughta be good for one new tire
and a couple of hoses, at least.

06:39.365 --> 06:41.925
Give me the ice pick, will ya?

06:47.340 --> 06:50.104
I don't want to have to spend
a day getting my tanks purged.

06:50.176 --> 06:51.871
A very distasteful procedure.

06:51.944 --> 06:54.003
Okay, okay.

06:55.114 --> 06:58.277
Afternoon, mister.
What'll it be?

06:58.351 --> 07:00.478
Afternoon. Fill 'er up, please.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.895
Uh, where's your cap, buddy?

07:13.966 --> 07:16.560
That's okay. It's a little
complicated. I'll take care of it.

07:16.636 --> 07:19.571
- Check under your hood?
- No, sir, don't bother.

07:19.639 --> 07:21.300
Oh, no trouble.

07:32.385 --> 07:35.821
I wouldn't do that
to my tire, if I were you.

07:46.999 --> 07:49.229
That's enough help, my friend.

07:55.842 --> 07:58.106
Ow.

08:00.179 --> 08:04.172
You okay?
Uh, sure. Sure.

08:04.250 --> 08:08.346
How much do I owe you there?
Uh, nothin'.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.787
Forget it. It's on the house.

08:10.857 --> 08:12.882
Hey, thanks.

08:24.370 --> 08:27.305
- Some people.
- I know, buddy. I know.

08:27.373 --> 08:29.307
He do any damage?

08:29.375 --> 08:31.866
To me? You must be jesting.

08:31.944 --> 08:34.378
Perhaps with some plastique,
a jackhammer...

08:34.447 --> 08:37.678
a diamond-edged hacksaw,
he may have had an outside chance...

08:37.750 --> 08:40.150
of throwing out a circuit or two,
but damage?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.594
The least you can do is give me
some decent bread and water.

08:56.669 --> 09:00.605
- His Highness is still complainin', huh?
- Nonstop.

09:00.673 --> 09:04.575
You can listen to him for a while.
I'm due over at Sinclair Headquarters.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.238
I'm acting night watch commander
for the whole county tonight.

09:07.313 --> 09:09.281
What a delightful thought.

09:09.348 --> 09:12.647
Almost makes me feel glad
to be spending the night in jail.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.619
It's all yours, Rex, old buddy.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.918
Have a cool evening, hear?

10:02.134 --> 10:04.125
I don't know, KITT.
I don't know.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.899
Michael, if you didn't
want my expertise,

10:06.973 --> 10:09.567
why did you just program me
with all this data?

10:09.642 --> 10:13.134
- Okay, okay.
- Here it is, Michael.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.644
I'll take S.C. Over Notre Dame, but I
think you're dead wrong about Penn State.

10:17.717 --> 10:19.912
They'll never make the point spread.

10:19.986 --> 10:22.648
Hello.

10:22.722 --> 10:25.350
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Bonnie. What's up?

10:25.424 --> 10:27.915
Help.
Help? What's that supposed to mean?

10:27.994 --> 10:29.928
It means Devon's in jail.

10:29.996 --> 10:33.762
Devon's busted? Come on.
That's ridiculous.

10:33.833 --> 10:36.700
Unfortunately, it also
happens to be true.

10:36.769 --> 10:39.795
What did they get him for?
Assault with a deadly crumpet?

10:39.872 --> 10:42.705
He was on his way to meet
a reporter named Reston...

10:42.775 --> 10:45.039
when he was picked up
on a traffic violation.

10:45.111 --> 10:48.706
A traffic violation?
And he's probably gonna fight it, huh?

10:48.781 --> 10:52.410
This I would love to see.
Where's he being held?

10:52.485 --> 10:55.318
A little town called Lyndhurst Flats.

10:55.388 --> 10:59.154
Strange. That's exactly 412 miles
straight ahead of us on this route.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.125
Why I called.

11:01.193 --> 11:03.753
And that's where we're going.

11:19.111 --> 11:23.104
All right. Let's go.
Okay. All right.

11:23.182 --> 11:26.515
Well, well, well.
What've we got here?

11:26.585 --> 11:29.952
Our favorite member of the press,
Frank Reston, in person.

11:30.022 --> 11:34.152
You guys are absolutely hilarious.

11:34.226 --> 11:38.856
- Come on. Let's go.
- Wait a minute, bozo. You can't book me without a breath test.

11:42.268 --> 11:44.236
You're a troublemaker, Reston.

11:44.303 --> 11:47.397
We don't need no breath test
to tell that.

11:47.473 --> 11:50.965
Why don't you just get on in there?

12:02.488 --> 12:05.150
Reston? Frank Reston?

12:06.926 --> 12:09.554
Fifth Amendment, old boy.

12:09.628 --> 12:12.324
I'll have a Fifth Amendment.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.561
That's a great name
for a booze, huh?

12:15.634 --> 12:18.728
I'm Devon Miles.

12:18.804 --> 12:24.299
That's an okay name for a liqueur,
I guess, but... not for a real booze.

12:24.376 --> 12:28.005
I'm Devon Miles
from the Foundation.

12:28.080 --> 12:32.574
You wrote me a letter about
an investigation you're conducting.

12:32.651 --> 12:35.245
Oh, I remember you.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.915
How come you never wrote me back?

12:37.990 --> 12:41.585
I decided to come and talk
to you personally.

12:41.660 --> 12:44.595
Well, you picked
a lousy place for a meeting.

12:44.663 --> 12:46.722
We can't talk here.

12:51.303 --> 12:55.467
Wallace here.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.566
Hey, Sarge.

12:57.643 --> 13:00.237
You're never gonna believe
who we picked up on a D & D rap.

13:00.312 --> 13:03.008
The mayor.
Come on. Be serious.

13:03.082 --> 13:05.812
Frank Reston, that creep.

13:05.885 --> 13:10.015
That loudmouth reporter's been trying to nail
something on us for the last three and a half years.

13:10.089 --> 13:13.855
- Reston, huh? All you got was on drunk
and disorderly? - Yep.

13:13.926 --> 13:17.862
- That's it. - Too bad you couldn't get something
real good, something like a sex offense.

13:17.930 --> 13:22.833
Well, you know, Sarge,
something could be arranged.

13:22.902 --> 13:25.336
I'll tell you what.

13:25.404 --> 13:27.338
It's gonna be a slow night.

13:27.406 --> 13:30.967
Why don't you bring good old Frank
over here to see me at Sinclair.

13:31.043 --> 13:33.034
He and I are gonna
have a long talk.

13:33.112 --> 13:36.104
- Right away, Sarge.
- Thanks, Rex.

13:47.193 --> 13:50.594
Okay, guys, fun time's over!

13:50.663 --> 13:53.427
How much is it gonna cost me
to get outta here?

13:53.499 --> 13:55.865
Are you insinuating
that we might take a bribe?

13:55.935 --> 13:59.268
Oh, just a shot in the dark.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.136
I don't know what ever made me
think that I could corrupt...

14:02.208 --> 14:05.234
a couple of honest officials
such as yourselves.

14:05.311 --> 14:08.075
Look, why don't you
just take it easy, huh?

14:08.147 --> 14:12.516
I'd like to give you the same advice. These
fellows have a unique way of interpreting the law.

14:12.585 --> 14:16.419
You don't have to tell me about it, pal.
I know all about these guys...

14:16.488 --> 14:19.048
and their boss, Judge Paxton.

14:19.124 --> 14:22.059
- Ain't that right, boys?
- I wouldn't know about that.

14:22.127 --> 14:25.563
But I do know they want to see you at
headquarters in Sinclair. So let's get going.

14:26.732 --> 14:30.133
Well, suppose I don't wanna go
to Sinclair just right now?

14:30.202 --> 14:32.432
Well,

14:32.504 --> 14:35.940
the book doesn't say anything
about what you do or don't want.

14:36.008 --> 14:38.238
They tell me to take you,
you're gonna go.

14:40.079 --> 14:42.309
An offer I can't resist, huh?

14:44.183 --> 14:46.151
All right. Okay.

14:49.154 --> 14:51.145
Let's go.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.625
Easy.

14:55.694 --> 14:58.959
My mother'll get mad at you.

14:59.031 --> 15:01.056
All right. Let's go.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.387
KITT, you sure you know
where this place is?

15:24.456 --> 15:28.051
Of course I do. We're approaching
the city limits even as we speak.

15:30.896 --> 15:33.626
Hey, right you are, old buddy.
Michael,

15:33.699 --> 15:36.224
remember we're due
in Phoenix at 5:00 today.

15:36.302 --> 15:38.236
Yeah. That can wait.

15:38.304 --> 15:42.536
I wouldn't miss the chance to bail out our
illustrious leader for all the pasta in Italy.

15:55.621 --> 16:00.251
- Two officers are here to see you,
Judge Paxton. - Show them in.

16:01.226 --> 16:05.253
All right, Wallace. What's the
big emergency? What's the problem?

16:05.331 --> 16:07.891
It's that reporter, Reston,
we busted last night.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.901
What about him?

16:09.969 --> 16:14.565
We were sort of talking to him and
went a little overboard. He's dead.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.733
What?

16:16.809 --> 16:19.710
Look, we barely touched him,
Judge. I mean...

16:19.778 --> 16:22.838
Well, the guy just sort of
blacked out all of a sudden.

16:22.915 --> 16:25.349
You incompetent fools.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.351
Do you realize what this means?

16:27.419 --> 16:31.412
That's the last thing we need... For this
county to be swarmin' with investigators.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.550
Judge, I think we can cover it up.
Make it look like an accident?

16:34.626 --> 16:38.187
- No one will even know he's been arrested.
- Except that guy in jail.

16:38.263 --> 16:40.197
What are you talking about?

16:40.265 --> 16:44.224
Some British dude we picked up in
the speed trap. He's the only witness.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.606
Well, in that case,
you boys better make sure...

16:48.674 --> 16:51.575
you find a way
to keep his mouth shut...

16:51.643 --> 16:54.510
till this whole thing blows over.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.048
- Right?
- Right.

17:02.588 --> 17:05.989
Well, this looks like the place.

17:07.459 --> 17:10.951
Don't you go sightseeing, huh?
I shall return.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.465
- What if you're required to post a bond?
- Don't worry.

17:14.532 --> 17:18.435
I promise I won't
put you up for collateral.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.307
Sorry, Mrs. Reston, we can find
no arrest record for a Frank Reston.

17:26.377 --> 17:30.815
Who said anything about arrest?
All I want to know is where he is.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.046
I've checked down at the paper,
and they don't know.

17:34.119 --> 17:37.282
I've looked in every bar
in town. Nothing.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.290
He couldn't have just disappeared.

17:39.358 --> 17:43.124
If I were you, Mrs. Reston, I'd go home
and wait for him. He's bound to show up.

17:43.195 --> 17:46.995
- First of all, he's my ex-husband.
- I wish I could help, Mrs. Reston.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.160
Yeah, I bet you do.

17:55.874 --> 17:58.001
Hi.
What can I do for you?

17:58.077 --> 18:01.103
- Well, I'm here to pick up Devon Miles.
- Oh.

18:01.180 --> 18:04.149
Well, as you can see, Mr. Miles
is no longer staying with us.

18:04.216 --> 18:06.150
What'd he do, spring himself?

18:06.218 --> 18:10.621
No, nothing like that. We transferred him over
to Sinclair. It's about 20 miles from here.

18:10.689 --> 18:13.453
Why's that?
We're not equipped for long stays.

18:13.525 --> 18:17.962
Besides, your friend preferred a cell to a fine,
so we moved him where he'd be more comfortable.

18:18.030 --> 18:21.295
- When's his court appearance?
- You'll have to check with the county clerk about that.

18:21.366 --> 18:23.493
That's all. I'm busy.

18:33.579 --> 18:37.481
Excuse me. Seems like we got
a kind of similar problem.

18:37.549 --> 18:40.814
I'm kind of a stranger in town.
I was hoping maybe you could help me.

18:40.886 --> 18:43.150
Don't see why not.

18:43.222 --> 18:45.190
Look, I'm on my way to Sinclair.

18:45.257 --> 18:48.852
You're welcome to come along.
Maybe he's there.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.360
Okay. Thank you.

19:00.572 --> 19:03.871
Hey, this is some car.
Yeah, it is. Thanks.

19:03.942 --> 19:09.209
Wait a minute. Carol Reston? My boss, Devon
Miles, stopped off here to see a guy named Reston.

19:09.281 --> 19:12.614
Same fella?
Uh, yeah. It has to be.

19:12.684 --> 19:15.778
Any idea why?
No, not a clue.

19:15.854 --> 19:19.915
Well, maybe our meeting like this could turn
out to be a lucky break for both of us, huh?

19:19.992 --> 19:22.483
Maybe it could at that.

19:35.974 --> 19:37.908
When was the last time
you saw your ex?

19:42.314 --> 19:45.078
Of course, that was always
his excuse when we were married.

19:45.150 --> 19:48.347
What kind of work does he do?
He's an investigative reporter.

19:48.420 --> 19:51.719
And let me tell you,
in this town that's a full-time job.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.590
There.
There it is.

19:59.231 --> 20:02.098
Sorry, we haven't got
a Frank Reston or a Devon Miles.

20:02.167 --> 20:05.432
Wait a minute. The police at Lyndhurst
Flats just told me they sent 'em over here.

20:05.504 --> 20:08.439
- Now you're telling me you don't have 'em
in your jails here? - That's correct.

20:08.507 --> 20:10.839
- Well, I'm a little confused.
- You want me to call 'em?

20:10.909 --> 20:13.969
Yes, sir, I'd like you to call 'em. I'd
like to find some answers, if you don't mind.

20:14.046 --> 20:18.506
Uh, no, that's okay. We've gotta go back
there anyway. We'll straighten everything out.

20:18.584 --> 20:21.519
- Whatever you say.
- Wait a minute. We're not going anywhere.

20:21.587 --> 20:25.250
Michael, your boss is not here.
Please, let's just get out of here.

20:25.324 --> 20:29.055
You folks have a nice day...
on your way out of town.

20:34.866 --> 20:38.700
- What was that all about? - I think there's a few
things that you're not aware of.

20:38.770 --> 20:41.534
Yeah, like one,
the whereabouts of Devon Miles.

20:41.607 --> 20:44.599
All right. If you wanna go back
on your wild goose chase, go ahead.

20:44.676 --> 20:48.442
- I just thought you might like to know
what you're up against. - What do you mean?

20:48.513 --> 20:51.949
- Have you ever heard of Judge Paxton?
- No. Who is he?

20:52.017 --> 20:56.283
He runs this county. And from what Frank
tells me, he does it with an iron fist.

20:56.355 --> 20:59.984
If he wants someone to disappear,
nobody asks any questions.

21:00.058 --> 21:03.221
Carol, all Devon did
was break the speed limit.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.995
He, uh, enjoys his tailor-mades.

21:14.072 --> 21:17.803
My, my, what a smell.
All squeaky clean, are we?

21:17.876 --> 21:21.676
I've had the pleasure of
one of your antiseptic showers.

21:21.747 --> 21:25.308
Yes. Well, the county hates the thought
of nasty bugs in your designer pants.

21:25.384 --> 21:27.375
By the way, I love your accent.

21:27.452 --> 21:31.650
- Just a fitting, Pink. Save the socializing, huh?
- What's your shoe size?

21:31.723 --> 21:35.921
- Ten and a half, "D." - Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
We've just had a run on half sizes.

21:35.994 --> 21:38.485
You'll have to wear
two pair of socks instead.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.328
Here you go.
Thank you.

21:44.403 --> 21:48.806
Oh, we aim to please.
If you need anything else,
Your Highness, just ask for Pink.

21:48.874 --> 21:52.537
Come on before he
invites you to tea.

21:52.611 --> 21:56.012
There's some guy in town
asking questions about Devon Miles.

21:56.081 --> 21:59.448
Well, I don't doubt that.

21:59.518 --> 22:02.316
This just came in.

22:02.387 --> 22:06.619
Seems that Mr. Devon Miles
is the executive director...

22:06.692 --> 22:10.184
of the Foundation
of Law and Government.

22:10.262 --> 22:13.891
You have gotten us
into one fine fix, Wallace.

22:13.965 --> 22:18.868
Now, you listen to me,
and you listen good.

22:18.937 --> 22:22.566
We can't take the risk
of Miles talkin'.

22:22.641 --> 22:25.109
Judge, he can't do
much talkin' at the facility.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.611
I said I don't wanna
take any chances.

22:28.847 --> 22:34.444
Now, Miles is the only link
that can tie us to Reston.

22:34.519 --> 22:38.888
So I want Mr. Miles
out of the way... for good.

22:41.927 --> 22:45.886
Yeah. It's for you.

22:45.964 --> 22:47.898
- Wallace.
- Wallace?

22:47.966 --> 22:51.902
Butler. That smart-mouthed Knight
just left with Mrs. Reston.

22:51.970 --> 22:54.404
They're headin' back
to Lyndhurst Flats.

22:54.473 --> 22:56.839
I don't think either one
left here very happy.

22:56.908 --> 22:58.933
We'll take care of it.

23:01.413 --> 23:04.814
Pauly, come in.
This is Sergeant Wallace.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.511
Yeah, this is Pauly.
What is it, Sarge?

23:07.586 --> 23:10.419
We got a report on a black car.
License plate: KNIGHT.

23:10.489 --> 23:14.482
K-N-I-G-H-T. Came shooting through
town like a bat out of hell.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.925
- Where's he headed?
- Toward Lyndhurst Flats.

23:16.995 --> 23:19.964
He's about three miles ahead
of you, heading your way.

23:20.031 --> 23:23.262
Well, I should be coming up
on him real soon.

23:23.335 --> 23:25.826
That boy's gonna hurt somebody,
the way he's drivin'.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.964
- Would you mind helping us nail him?
- Not at all, Sarge.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.941
Thanks, Pauly.
We'll be right there.

23:42.988 --> 23:48.016
The more I see of this county's law
enforcement, the more suspicious I get.

23:48.093 --> 23:51.187
Yeah. If you knew
half as much as I do,

23:51.263 --> 23:53.629
you'd be positively paranoid.

24:09.214 --> 24:13.048
Michael, there's a large vehicle approaching
at high speed on the wrong side of the road.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.143
I advise evasive action.

24:15.220 --> 24:17.347
- What was that?
- I'll explain later.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.900
- I'm coming up on him now, Sarge.
- You know what to do.

24:31.736 --> 24:34.432
That truck sure picked
a bad time to pass.

24:38.009 --> 24:40.102
He's coming right at us.

24:41.413 --> 24:44.109
- Do something.
- Michael, hit the brake.

24:45.417 --> 24:48.614
Michael, put it in reverse.

24:48.687 --> 24:51.349
Just hang on.

24:51.423 --> 24:54.688
What the... No car can go
that fast in reverse.

24:56.461 --> 24:59.123
Michael, why reverse?
We could have jumped over.

24:59.197 --> 25:02.633
Because I wanna stay with these guys
and find out who put 'em up to it.

25:08.473 --> 25:11.306
Who can drive that good going
backwards at that kind of speed?

25:11.376 --> 25:13.970
What the hell
kind of a car is that?

25:41.573 --> 25:43.473
Look out!

25:43.542 --> 25:45.772
Whoa!

25:47.145 --> 25:51.946
- Aren't you sorry we gave that guy
such a hard time? - We're gonna fix him now.

25:52.017 --> 25:54.315
- You okay?
- I think so.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.446
That trucker sure has a strange way
of getting his jollies.

25:57.522 --> 26:00.616
That's only because
you think he was kidding.

26:10.435 --> 26:14.872
Anyway, as I was saying, the judge
has this county in his pocket.

26:14.940 --> 26:18.034
Not a buck changes hands that he
doesn't get a piece of somehow.

26:18.109 --> 26:22.603
- And Frank was onto this?
- That's what was keeping Frank alive.

26:22.681 --> 26:25.673
Look, five years ago,
Frank and I were
this real hotshot team...

26:25.750 --> 26:29.208
working on the biggest
newspaper in Texas.

26:29.287 --> 26:31.653
And then he started
drinking heavy and,

26:31.723 --> 26:35.989
well, one thing led to another,
and we wound up in Lyndhurst Flats.

26:36.061 --> 26:38.359
And that was mostly
the judge's fault too.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.762
Really? Why's that?

26:40.832 --> 26:45.531
Remember that skywalk that collapsed at the
Skylighter Hotel down here about three years ago?

26:45.604 --> 26:49.404
- Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do. A hundred
people were killed, right? - Right.

26:49.474 --> 26:53.911
Well, the judge's
principle source of income...

26:53.979 --> 26:56.311
was the Paxton Cement Company.

26:57.716 --> 27:02.551
Anyway, it seems that there was
too much sand and not enough
cement in that skywalk.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.385
And things got pretty hot
down here for a while.

27:05.457 --> 27:09.450
- And Frank found a story he could win with.
- Right.

27:09.527 --> 27:11.893
He could smell the Pulitzer prize...

27:11.963 --> 27:17.196
and just see the Washington Post or the New
York Times begging him to go back big-time.

27:19.137 --> 27:22.800
Anyway, he has been sniffing
at Paxton's heels for three years now...

27:22.874 --> 27:25.138
and getting nowhere fast.

27:25.210 --> 27:29.044
The story's there, all right.
It's just the proof isn't.

27:29.114 --> 27:31.878
Well, that's tough, huh?
It's tough for both of you.

27:31.950 --> 27:36.853
I mean, the connection's there
between Devon and Frank and the judge.

27:36.921 --> 27:40.254
But, I mean, where are they?
I mean, if they're not in the jails,

27:40.325 --> 27:44.091
where could the judge
be stashing them in this county?

27:44.162 --> 27:47.325
Killing them would be the easiest.
No. No, ease up.

27:47.399 --> 27:49.924
If the judge wanted to do that,
he could've done that a long time ago.

27:50.001 --> 27:54.199
If the judge put up with Frank all these years,
he's not about to do something that drastic now,

27:54.272 --> 27:57.503
especially with Devon Miles
in the picture.

27:57.575 --> 28:00.806
Well, of course, there is
the county correctional facility.

28:00.879 --> 28:02.574
Can we get in there?

28:02.647 --> 28:05.548
No way. Unless, of course,
we announce ourselves,

28:05.617 --> 28:07.881
and then I'm afraid we're gonna get
the same old runaround.

28:07.952 --> 28:11.945
Well, then we'll just have
to go in unannounced.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.957
Hmm.

28:59.437 --> 29:02.270
Pink, you awake?

29:02.340 --> 29:04.604
Shep, what are you doing here?

29:05.944 --> 29:08.708
- How'd you get those keys?
- It wasn't easy.

29:08.780 --> 29:12.773
Look, I got it all figured out. We're bustin'
outta here first thing tomorrow morning.

29:12.851 --> 29:14.819
- Shh!
- What's the matter?

29:15.754 --> 29:19.713
- Damn! Who's he?
- He's my new cell mate. His name's Devon.

29:19.791 --> 29:21.725
I think he's British or somethin'.

29:21.793 --> 29:25.490
I don't care what he is.
He's foulin' up my plan good.

29:25.563 --> 29:27.224
How?

29:27.298 --> 29:32.201
Because three is a crowd
when it comes to escapin;

29:32.270 --> 29:35.535
Put your mind at rest.
I have no intention of leaving this place...

29:35.607 --> 29:38.167
until I have my day in court.

29:38.243 --> 29:41.872
- That's what you think.
- Wait a minute. Why does he have to go with us?

29:41.946 --> 29:44.380
'Cause he knows we're goin',
that's why.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.418
What's to stop him from blowing the
whistle on us the minute we make our break?

29:48.753 --> 29:52.154
- You have my word.
- Right, we have his word.

29:52.223 --> 29:55.056
Shut up, Pink.
I say he's coming, and that's final.

29:55.126 --> 29:59.153
- I assume I have some say in this matter.
- Look.

29:59.230 --> 30:02.529
You either come out with us,
or stay here dead.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.932
Personally, I'd just
as soon not kill you.

30:05.003 --> 30:09.337
- The choice is yours.
- Thank you. What's your plan?

30:09.407 --> 30:12.399
- We get out in the truck.
- Truck? What truck?

30:12.477 --> 30:15.742
The one that starts with this key.
It'll be right outside in the morning.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.510
All we gotta do is get over
the wall, and we're home free.

30:18.583 --> 30:20.517
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

30:20.585 --> 30:23.611
How do you propose to climb
a 15-foot wall in broad daylight?

30:23.688 --> 30:25.622
I was working on it.

30:25.690 --> 30:27.590
You were working on it.

30:27.659 --> 30:31.720
The whole key to the success of this plan
is our success in getting over the wall,

30:31.796 --> 30:33.730
and you were working on it.

30:33.798 --> 30:36.460
- Well, you got a better idea?
- Not at the moment,

30:36.534 --> 30:39.264
but, if pressed, it wouldn't be
difficult to come up with one.

30:39.337 --> 30:42.738
Somehow, Devon, you don't strike me
as your typical jailbreaker.

30:42.807 --> 30:45.298
Yes, that's what the Gestapo thought.

30:45.376 --> 30:49.437
That's how I was able to escape from
two German prison camps during the war.

30:49.514 --> 30:52.210
That's kinda interesting.

30:52.283 --> 30:55.446
If you insist on my coming with you,
please give me the pleasure...

30:55.520 --> 30:58.546
of devising a suitable scheme
for our departure.

31:04.028 --> 31:07.088
- How much further?
- We got about 40 minutes before we get there.

31:07.165 --> 31:10.157
Maybe you can tell me some more
about this wonderful car of yours.

31:10.235 --> 31:13.261
Well, since we'll be going
into action real soon,

31:13.338 --> 31:17.832
I think this is as good a time as any
to introduce you to KITT.

31:17.909 --> 31:21.003
Kitt? Who's Kitt?

31:21.079 --> 31:23.479
- You're on, KITT.
- Very well, Michael.

31:23.548 --> 31:26.039
Allow me to introduce myself, Carol.

31:26.117 --> 31:29.985
I am KITT, whom you may regard as
the voice of the Knight Two Thousand.

31:30.054 --> 31:32.614
What was that?
A recording?

31:32.690 --> 31:35.124
Not exactly.
In fact, not at all.

31:35.193 --> 31:38.185
Now, if you'll allow me to continue,
I will attempt to describe...

31:38.263 --> 31:42.290
most of the qualities and capabilities
of this truly unique vehicle.

31:42.367 --> 31:44.198
You only got 40 minutes.

31:44.269 --> 31:46.203
I'll try to squeeze it all in.

31:46.271 --> 31:50.799
At any rate, starting with the indestructible
alloy that makes up my outer shell...

32:01.152 --> 32:03.643
Sign, Devon.

32:10.895 --> 32:14.456
- What the hell do you think you're doin'?
- You looked hungry.

32:14.532 --> 32:18.229
- Man, you're askin' for it.
- So are you, pal!

32:18.303 --> 32:21.136
That does it!

33:25.670 --> 33:27.661
Hold it!

33:59.504 --> 34:01.972
Way to go, Devon!

34:02.040 --> 34:05.066
Save the applause.
We're not out of the woods yet.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.621
- Wallace here.
- Yeah. You better get over here right now.

34:25.696 --> 34:30.531
- What's going on? - Three men just escaped from
the workhouse, and one of them is Devon Miles.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.775
- Excuse me, sir. Where is the warden?
- Someplace around. Who are you?

34:39.844 --> 34:43.371
I'm just a messenger. Judge Paxton sent me
over with an urgent message for the warden.

34:43.447 --> 34:45.382
Oh. Judge Paxton? Hmm.

34:45.449 --> 34:49.318
Well, I guess that's okay. You might start
looking for him in the administration building.

34:49.387 --> 34:51.446
Around to your left.
Thank you.

34:51.522 --> 34:54.116
By the way, what's
going on around here?

34:54.192 --> 34:58.891
- Three guys just busted outta here, and there's
gonna be hell to pay over that. - I bet. Glad it's not my problem.

34:58.963 --> 35:01.124
Thank you.

35:06.971 --> 35:11.067
They may be over the wall, but they're not off
the grounds. Step on it! We can still catch 'em!

35:28.726 --> 35:32.025
There they are!
We got 'em! No sweat!

35:41.606 --> 35:43.665
They're still gaining on us.

35:45.476 --> 35:48.172
There's no way.
We can't outrun 'em.

35:54.252 --> 35:56.186
Devon, watch out.
There's a work crew there.

35:56.254 --> 35:58.688
I have an idea.
What are you gonna do?

35:58.756 --> 36:00.724
You'll see.

36:02.593 --> 36:04.686
Oh, my God!

36:10.034 --> 36:11.968
Watch out!

36:28.119 --> 36:30.417
- Hey, KITT?
- Yes, Carol.

36:30.488 --> 36:34.948
- What's going on? - I'm receiving a transmission
from Michael. Go ahead, Michael.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.961
KITT, we just hit the jackpot.
Devon's here.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.053
Correction.

36:40.131 --> 36:42.998
Was here.

36:43.067 --> 36:45.661
Where's Devon?
That's what I'm trying to find out.

36:45.736 --> 36:47.829
He and two inmates
just busted outta here.

36:47.905 --> 36:50.840
Devon Miles busting out of jail.
I don't believe that.

36:50.908 --> 36:53.570
- Oh, it's true, all right.
- What was he doing here in the first place?

36:53.644 --> 36:58.138
Your friend was in the wrong place
at the wrong time, and so are you.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.684
Let's go, hero.

37:00.751 --> 37:04.243
I need help fast.

37:04.322 --> 37:06.085
Where are we going?

37:06.157 --> 37:08.125
To save Michael.

37:25.776 --> 37:28.210
Sarge, this is Saunders.

37:28.279 --> 37:31.373
- Yeah, what is it?
- We caught Pink and Shep in the pickup.

37:31.449 --> 37:35.044
- What about Miles? - We think he's hiding
in the grove down by the river.

37:35.119 --> 37:37.485
All right. Flush him out
and shoot to kill.

37:49.967 --> 37:53.994
All right. Get in the car.
Get in the backseat.

37:54.071 --> 37:57.734
- You'll never get out of here. They'll blow this
car to pieces. - We'll see about that. Get in there!

37:57.808 --> 37:59.742
Wallace is in trouble!

37:59.810 --> 38:02.335
- If he moves, put a hole in him!
- Open fire!

38:21.966 --> 38:26.062
Where are those groves
your partner was talking about?

38:26.137 --> 38:30.073
- Take a right at the next dirt road. - You
get on that walkie-talkie. You call your boys.

38:30.141 --> 38:33.304
Tell 'em you're on your way.
Forget it.

38:33.377 --> 38:35.470
Shoot him.

38:38.282 --> 38:42.241
- Saunders, listen to me.
- Don't worry, Sarge.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.914
He's hiding in the grove
down by the river.

38:44.989 --> 38:48.925
Keep him cornered, but don't... I
repeat, do not kill him. Wait for me.

38:48.993 --> 38:51.018
Whatever you say, Sarge,

38:51.095 --> 38:55.759
but I oughta tell you Judge Paxton's got
a $10,000 price tag on His Highness's head.

38:55.833 --> 38:58.529
These boys want at him pretty bad.

39:08.012 --> 39:11.277
We got him now!
He went this way! Come on!

39:39.143 --> 39:41.737
KITT, you got the scanners going?

39:41.812 --> 39:45.248
Michael, I'm picking up a single individual
being pursued by two others.

39:45.316 --> 39:50.413
It should be Devon.
Heading: 183. Range: 350 meters.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.422
Who said that?

39:52.490 --> 39:57.086
I'd love for you to stick around and
find out, but I'm afraid we need the room.

39:57.161 --> 40:00.255
Enjoy your flight.

40:28.793 --> 40:32.285
Your timing couldn't have
been more felicitous.

40:32.363 --> 40:35.526
"Felicitous"? That mean
you're glad to see me?

40:35.599 --> 40:39.160
I've never been happier
to see anyone in my life.

40:51.081 --> 40:54.050
I hit him!
I swear I hit that car!

40:54.118 --> 40:56.916
Come on!
We can't let 'em get away!

41:05.663 --> 41:10.157
- How do we get outta here? - You better
swing around and go back the way we came in.

41:18.909 --> 41:21.070
Damn farmers!

41:35.593 --> 41:38.721
We'll take the high road
and cut 'em off.

41:38.796 --> 41:41.230
There's one above us
and one below us.

41:46.270 --> 41:48.261
Michael, the brake.

41:50.207 --> 41:53.040
Look out!

41:59.350 --> 42:01.250
Now, that's incredible.

42:01.318 --> 42:05.721
- We still have to make it to the county line, though.
- We should have a clear shot now.

42:05.789 --> 42:08.883
Doesn't that deserve a word of thanks?

42:16.901 --> 42:18.994
Pauly, this is Saunders.

42:19.069 --> 42:23.472
Listen, I don't care what it takes.
Just don't let him cross that county line.

42:23.541 --> 42:26.874
You got it. Pete, are you
anywhere near the bridge?

42:26.944 --> 42:29.435
About a half a mile, Pauly.
What do you need?

42:29.513 --> 42:32.846
Block the bridge for me. There's a
guy in a black car that needs stopping.

42:32.917 --> 42:35.442
Will do, Pauly.

43:00.277 --> 43:04.509
I'll hold him here in the middle of the
bridge, Pauly. Sucker won't get past me.

43:18.896 --> 43:21.330
Michael, we're approaching
the county line.

43:21.398 --> 43:24.561
It's just over the bridge.
Thank God.

43:28.939 --> 43:32.340
Yeah, I'm on their tail.
We got 'em in a squeeze play.

43:44.221 --> 43:47.156
Uh-oh.

43:47.224 --> 43:49.920
Michael, I've done a scan
on the stalled vehicle ahead.

43:49.994 --> 43:52.485
Automotively speaking, there's
absolutely nothing wrong with it.

43:52.563 --> 43:55.589
It's a trap.

43:55.666 --> 43:59.193
We got 'em. We're gonna make
tin tortillas out of that flashy car.

44:04.642 --> 44:08.078
- Michael, don't you think you'd
better do something? - Hold on.

44:10.914 --> 44:13.940
You're not thinking of...
Oh, my word, you are!

44:18.022 --> 44:20.388
What is that?

44:42.846 --> 44:46.907
Good afternoon, Judge. I was beginning
to fear that you might not show up.

44:46.984 --> 44:49.953
Who are you? And how did
you get in here anyway?

44:50.020 --> 44:51.954
Oh, details. Mere details.

44:52.022 --> 44:56.891
The important thing is that I'm here,
and I'm quite sure that you know who I am.

44:56.960 --> 45:00.396
- Yes, Mr. Devon Miles.
- Very perceptive of you.

45:00.464 --> 45:02.728
But they told me you'd escaped yesterday.

45:02.800 --> 45:06.327
And how right they were,
but, as you see, I've come back.

45:06.403 --> 45:09.133
For what?
Why, to collect you, of course.

45:09.206 --> 45:12.573
Once we got away,
we went straight to the state police.

45:12.643 --> 45:16.511
They were very interested in our assorted
tales about you and your colleagues,

45:16.580 --> 45:19.105
especially in how
you killed Frank Reston.

45:19.183 --> 45:23.813
- Now, just a minute. - In point of fact,
they've already rounded up Sergeant Wallace,

45:23.887 --> 45:27.983
Officer Saunders and all the others,
whom, I'm happy to say,

45:28.058 --> 45:32.427
talked quite freely about a great
number of things, but mostly about you.

45:32.496 --> 45:35.693
So you see, Judge,
you've been bagged.

45:35.766 --> 45:37.700
Not on your life, Miles.

45:37.768 --> 45:40.669
I'm leaving, and you're
not about to stop me.

45:45.509 --> 45:47.443
My!

45:47.511 --> 45:49.843
That felt simply wonderful.

45:57.788 --> 46:00.951
I'd forgotten how exhilarating
freedom can be.

46:01.024 --> 46:04.983
Nothing like a little time in the slammer
to make you appreciate the wide-open spaces.

46:05.062 --> 46:07.121
True, but it was time well spent.

46:07.197 --> 46:10.030
We managed to clean up
some rather nasty business back there.

46:10.100 --> 46:13.365
The bad guys behind bars
and the good guys walkin' away.

46:13.437 --> 46:15.496
All except poor Frank Reston.

46:15.572 --> 46:18.370
I'm afraid he paid a rather heavy
price for his persistence.

46:18.442 --> 46:21.377
Yeah, but like Carol said
when she found out they killed him,

46:21.445 --> 46:24.710
by dying, he accomplished
everything he tried to in life.

46:24.782 --> 46:28.047
The story he left behind, Devon...
he's a cinch for the Pulitzer prize.

46:28.118 --> 46:31.485
It's rather an expensive price,
don't you think?

46:31.555 --> 46:35.582
- I wonder if he would have thought so.
- Yeah, I wonder.

46:39.062 --> 46:41.758
KITT, what's happening?
Why are you slowing down?

46:41.832 --> 46:44.596
I've picked up what could be a police
officer about a hundred meters ahead.

46:44.668 --> 46:46.932
That's okay.
You're only doing 55.

46:47.004 --> 46:51.498
I know, I know. But considering Mr. Miles's
tact when it comes to dealing with the police,

46:51.575 --> 46:54.669
I thought it'd be best
not to take any chances.

46:54.745 --> 46:57.908
Now, look here, KITT.
What are you trying to say?

47:17.935 --> 47:21.962
Michael Knight, a lone crusader
in a dangerous world,

47:22.039 --> 47:24.803
the world of the Knight Rider.
