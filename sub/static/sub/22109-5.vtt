D'oh!

02:11.699 --> 02:13.701
*

02:20.208 --> 02:21.609
Great birthday trip.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.445
One more thing to remind me
of my insignificance.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.680
(Grampa groans)

02:26.714 --> 02:30.484
Two adults, one student,
one boy who just phones it in,

02:30.518 --> 02:33.287
and a senior citizen veteran
on his birthday.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.556
Oh, and I'd like to apply
my astronaut discount.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.325
I'll need to see your diaper.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.128
Typical cheapskate Homer.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.697
Taking all the fun
out of turning 87.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.699
Get this stupid
party hat off me!

02:45.733 --> 02:46.700
What the...?

02:46.734 --> 02:48.402
Oh, I'll fix it.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.839
(Grampa groans)

02:55.576 --> 02:57.878
Woo-hoo! 182!

02:57.911 --> 03:00.681
Homer, that's your weight
on the moon.

03:00.714 --> 03:01.982
(shrieks)

03:02.015 --> 03:03.384
PLUTO (distorted):
I used to be a planet.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.586
Then one day they called
and said it was over.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.588
It's over when I say it's over!

03:07.621 --> 03:09.390
So sad.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.824
But I'll be back.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.393
I'm working on some stuff.

03:12.426 --> 03:16.163
Let's just say you might not be
seeing Halley's Comet no more.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.198

faintly inside)

03:22.603 --> 03:24.171
Losers.

NARRATOR: Forged in a nanosecond
in the Big Bang,

03:33.281 --> 03:35.749
our universe is so enormous,

03:35.783 --> 03:39.086
every NFL stadium
could fit inside it.

03:39.119 --> 03:41.389
And their parking lots.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.257
(crowd oohing, gasping)

03:43.291 --> 03:44.925
When's this show gonna start?

03:44.958 --> 03:46.694
It has started.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.563
(stammers) How can it have
started if I'm talking?

03:49.597 --> 03:51.098
Wouldn't that bother everyone?

03:51.131 --> 03:55.303
Quiet!
I can't hear the Big Bang!

03:55.336 --> 03:58.939
NARRATOR: Approximately
13.8 billion years ago...

03:58.972 --> 04:00.774
-(gasps) Billion?
-...the universe consisted of

04:00.808 --> 04:03.944
a tiny singularity
of enormous mass,

04:03.977 --> 04:07.915
which suddenly burst forth
in the greatest explosion ever.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.784
Fire in the theater!

04:10.818 --> 04:13.987
No! Your pupils aren't
ready for Earth light!

04:14.021 --> 04:16.390
(crowd screams, gasps)

04:16.424 --> 04:18.158
Damn it, I was developing film!

04:18.191 --> 04:20.494
(jazz band playing
"In the Mood" over stereo)

04:25.933 --> 04:27.801
Turn it up!

04:27.835 --> 04:29.169
I can't hear it!

04:29.202 --> 04:31.605
Louder!

04:32.940 --> 04:34.642
Keep it down!

04:34.675 --> 04:36.510
(tires screech, music stops)

04:40.348 --> 04:42.850
Mm, happy birthday.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.185
I never want to hear that again!

04:45.218 --> 04:47.421
* Happy birthday *

04:47.455 --> 04:50.324
* To you *

04:50.358 --> 04:52.693
* Happy birthday *

04:52.726 --> 04:55.629
* To you. *

04:55.663 --> 04:57.531
Say my name, you cowards!

04:57.565 --> 04:59.367
Make a wish, party pooper.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.669
Okay, I will.

05:01.702 --> 05:02.703
(man groans)

05:04.405 --> 05:05.806
That was a coincidence.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.942
I got you
the one birthday present

05:08.976 --> 05:10.644
you can really use.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.980
A call girl that kills me after?

05:13.013 --> 05:16.183
-A hearing aid.
-A hearing aid?

05:16.216 --> 05:19.152
Forget it. People will think
I'm old, dadgummit.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.488
You are old.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.657
You've lived long enough
to see your prejudiced attitudes

05:23.691 --> 05:25.158
come back into fashion.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.828
Lousy Greeks.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.899

*

05:58.291 --> 06:00.728
(laughs)

06:00.761 --> 06:02.095
Thank you.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.566
Bart! Bart!

06:05.599 --> 06:06.867
Wake up.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.602
-Yo. What's up?
-Listen.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.270
The planetarium said
the universe is

06:10.303 --> 06:12.740
13.8 billion years old.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.609
But I turned in a paper
where I said million!

06:15.643 --> 06:17.244
What do you want from me?

06:17.277 --> 06:18.912
(snake rattles)

06:18.946 --> 06:20.347
I was just wondering

06:20.380 --> 06:23.951
if you were planning on breaking
into the school anytime soon.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.753
You know, like, maybe tonight.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.054
Nope. Not till next month.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.288
Please.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.757
I'll do your homework!

06:29.790 --> 06:31.859
Sounds like you can't even
do your own homework.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.927
-Ouch.
-Yeah, you think about that

06:33.961 --> 06:36.430
while I'm breaking you
into the school.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.765
LISA:
Hmm.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.567
MARGE:
Who's breaking into the school?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.569
Bart's just talking
in his sleep!

06:41.602 --> 06:43.804
MARGE: I believe that.
Trust you. Good night!

06:47.575 --> 06:49.743
How did you know
this door was broken?

06:49.777 --> 06:51.278
Eh, Willie keeps me posted.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.946
I keep him in licorice.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.247
(grunts)

06:54.281 --> 06:56.950
Willie's riding
the red pony tonight.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.520
(moaning)

07:06.026 --> 07:08.328
Look who's got pumpkin stickers!

07:08.361 --> 07:10.731
Bart, those are for Halloween.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.433
Also Thanksgiving,
if there's some left over.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.809
Whoa! Where has this been
all my life?

07:21.842 --> 07:24.845
Come on, let's go!

07:24.878 --> 07:27.114
Okay. You fixed
your stupid paper,

07:27.147 --> 07:29.483
and I scored
the teacher's nicotine gum.

07:29.517 --> 07:32.352
She does that so she doesn't
smell like cigarettes, you know.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.354
Yeah, and she should also
get some booze gum.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.858
(mechanical buzzing)

07:37.891 --> 07:39.359
What's that?

07:39.392 --> 07:40.961
Maybe it's the ghost of that boy

07:40.994 --> 07:44.164
who had to climb that rope
in gym until his heart exploded.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.166
(gasps) You're making that up.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.201
Am I that creative?

07:48.235 --> 07:49.603
No.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.639
(mechanical buzzing continues)

08:00.080 --> 08:02.382
(mechanical buzzing continues)

08:02.415 --> 08:04.852
Oh, God.

08:04.885 --> 08:05.886
(gasps)

08:07.721 --> 08:09.022
Principal Skinner.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.291
Are you living in the school?

08:11.324 --> 08:14.995
Absolutely not.
And you have no proof.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.198
(groans)

08:20.433 --> 08:22.402
Seymour, why are you
living here?

08:22.435 --> 08:23.704
You have a house.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.472
With 30 pizzas on the way.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.640
30 pizzas.

08:26.674 --> 08:29.577
I can finally send mama
back to Italy! Mwah!

08:29.610 --> 08:31.244
It's not my house,
it's Mother's.

08:31.278 --> 08:35.215
But after what I just found out
she did, I can never go back.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.918
They say it's better to talk
about it, but I never will.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.352
-Okay.
-We understand.

08:39.386 --> 08:41.488
Seriously, don't ask
what it was.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.657
-Are you asking?
-I was stretching.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.025
Then why'd you only
stretch one arm?

08:45.058 --> 08:46.827
It's the only arm
that needed stretching.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.361
Fine, I'll tell you what it was.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.697
-You don't have to.
-Really, it's okay.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.698
We believe you.

08:50.731 --> 08:51.999
Ever since I was a kid,

08:52.032 --> 08:53.601
I-I wanted to be a drummer.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.335
-In a rock band?
-No.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.504
Marching.

08:57.537 --> 09:01.341
I would've given all I had
to be the dot on that "I."

09:01.374 --> 09:02.876
It's also called a "tittle."

09:02.910 --> 09:04.177
Don't you think I know that?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.113
I did everything I could
to make that band.

09:06.146 --> 09:10.117
In my application, I sent
songs and choreographies.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.152
(lively marching band music
playing)

09:21.895 --> 09:23.897
I'm a shoo-in!

09:29.803 --> 09:32.239
Then the fateful day came.

09:32.272 --> 09:36.109
Son, you got a letter from
Ohio State University.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.278
I'm too nervous to get up.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.748
-Do you want me
to read it to you? -Yes.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.484
I'm sorry.

09:44.517 --> 09:45.919
You were rejected.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.254
Uh, seems kind of thick.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.889
Well, they gave you
a lot of reasons

09:48.922 --> 09:50.223
why you weren't good enough.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.225
*

09:52.259 --> 09:54.061
That's so sad.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.396
There's more I have to tell you.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.399
I was going to surprise Mother
by papering her drawers,

09:59.432 --> 10:00.901
then I found this.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.169
I was accepted.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.336
She lied.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.172
That's so sad.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.807
-(Bart chuckles)
-What makes this really tragic

10:06.840 --> 10:08.909
is there was also
a personal handwritten letter

10:08.942 --> 10:10.277
from the Director of Admissions.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.454
(sniffs)
What's that smell?

10:21.488 --> 10:24.457
I'm making spaghetti
and kick balls.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.013
Does it get worse than that?

10:46.046 --> 10:47.715
How could it be worse than that?

10:47.748 --> 10:49.683
May I see the letter?

10:49.717 --> 10:52.686
(scoffs) I must say your
sympathy is a pleasant surprise.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.155
No, this is just the only
college acceptance letter

10:55.188 --> 10:56.489
I'll ever hold.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.160
Mm.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.366
So it's for all these reasons
that I will not be seeking

11:06.399 --> 11:07.868
a seat in the U.S. Senate.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.137
I will now take a few questions.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.340
Let me tell you the wonderful
present I just got.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.975
Dad! What a surprise!

11:15.008 --> 11:16.476
(under breath):
What's he doing here?

11:16.509 --> 11:18.145
Didn't we just
see him yesterday?

11:18.178 --> 11:20.247
GRAMPA: That's what they're
saying under their breath?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.816
How awful!
I want to hear all of it.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.485
Maybe if we pretend we're tired,
he'll go home.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.520
(all yawning)

11:29.689 --> 11:31.591
Thank God he can't hear us.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.593
And I'm glad these fake yawns

11:33.626 --> 11:35.695
are something we can do
as a family.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.365
What?! You, too?!

11:38.398 --> 11:39.867
Good-bye!

11:39.900 --> 11:41.001
Dad, wait!

11:41.034 --> 11:42.369
What's wrong with the old coot?

11:42.402 --> 11:45.538
I mean, what's wrong with you,
you sweet old coot?

11:45.572 --> 11:49.509
I got a hearing aid,
and I heard everything you said.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.445
We didn't mean
the mean things we meant.

11:52.479 --> 11:55.115
We just said them
because we meant them.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.183
(stammers angrily)

11:56.216 --> 11:58.451
I am gone forever!

12:01.321 --> 12:03.490
A little mall walk
will cheer me up.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.030
Uh-oh, old guy.
Don't make eye contact.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.465
Rubbing them is like
working dry lasagna.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.402
Old guy! Here he comes!

12:15.435 --> 12:17.204
He'll want to try
all my lotion samples.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.007
I'll have to explain
what "send" is on a cell phone.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.415
Come in! Come in!

12:28.448 --> 12:30.417
Well, that's more like it.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.518
(screams)

12:33.753 --> 12:37.557
(Lisa gasping, groaning)

12:37.590 --> 12:39.392
I had to cheat.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.929
I was doing it
for the bell curve.

12:41.962 --> 12:45.065
And with 99% of the vote in,

12:45.098 --> 12:47.734
the next president
is Lisa Simps...

12:47.767 --> 12:49.169
Wait a minute.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.605
I'm being told she cheated
on a paper in second grade.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.407
She is disqualified,

12:54.441 --> 12:57.244
making our next president
Kenny Hitler.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.847
No!

13:01.381 --> 13:04.117
Hey, welcome to
Bob Hope's USO Show,

13:04.151 --> 13:07.354
or as I like to call it,
Christmas away from Dolores.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.688
(rim shot, cymbal crash)

13:08.721 --> 13:10.958
Oh, that could've been me
on those drums.

13:10.991 --> 13:14.094
I would've gotten to rehearse
at his house in Toluca Lake.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.863
Toluca Lake!

13:18.798 --> 13:20.100
What'll it be?

13:20.133 --> 13:23.236
Can an old vet have a beer
and tell you his troubles?

13:24.671 --> 13:25.805
Sure.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.841
(no audio)

13:34.581 --> 13:37.584
And that's how
I opened the orange.

13:43.924 --> 13:47.360
So, uh, (chuckles) my mother
didn't tell me I got in.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.562
That's all right.
You can enroll now.

13:49.596 --> 13:50.830
-Can I?
-No!

13:50.864 --> 13:53.333
This is a school,
not an '80s comedy.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.235
That, uh, letter you sent me--

13:55.268 --> 13:57.070
is that something
you send every student?

13:57.104 --> 14:00.073
No, I only sent that once,
to you.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.408
When you didn't show up,

14:01.441 --> 14:03.911
that was the second worst day
of my career.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.078
What was the worst?

14:05.112 --> 14:07.814
The day the Big Ten expanded
to 14 schools.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.416
What are we, morons?

14:09.449 --> 14:12.920
We didn't even notice till
Northwestern pointed it out.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.590
Oh, I'm sorry, should I not have
told you about the letter?

14:17.624 --> 14:19.026
Uh, no.

14:19.059 --> 14:22.362
It's actually good,
because I'm no longer sad.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.997
I'm angry!

14:24.031 --> 14:27.434
It's time for a furious
self-guided tour of this campus.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.936
*

14:37.810 --> 14:40.713
I've never seen someone
walk the oval so many times.

14:40.747 --> 14:42.115
He's got to be dizzy.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.617
I switch directions
every other lap.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.456
-Oh, uh, Michigan sucks.
-What?

14:49.489 --> 14:51.624
That's how we say "excuse me"
around here.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.793
(bells chiming melody)

14:53.826 --> 14:56.964
CHOIR (to melody):
* Loser, loser *

14:56.997 --> 15:00.033
* Loser, loser *

15:00.067 --> 15:01.801
* Missed opportunity *

15:01.834 --> 15:03.636
* All over now *

15:03.670 --> 15:05.772
* You poor bastard. *

15:05.805 --> 15:07.740
Et tu, Brutus?

15:07.774 --> 15:09.376
Hey! (grunts)

15:09.409 --> 15:13.580
Okay, Mother, it's time for
an unpleasant confrontation.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.816
(school bell ringing)

15:16.849 --> 15:19.486
Class, I'm going to hand back
your astronomy papers.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.154
LISA:
Keep calm. Keep calm.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.390
No one knows
you did anything wrong.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.825
Lisa Simpson, come to my desk.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.660
(gasps)

15:27.694 --> 15:30.563
Miss Hoover, I have to confess.
I changed my paper.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.733
It said million,
but I knew it was billion.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.168
(sobs):
Oh, please.

15:35.202 --> 15:38.838
Maybe I can start a new life
in the other second grade class.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.007
(sobbing)

15:40.040 --> 15:41.508
I know you changed your paper.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.010
I don't care about your grade.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.777
Where the hell
is my nicotine gum?

15:44.811 --> 15:46.246
(sniffles)

15:46.279 --> 15:50.817
My brother had it, and he was
hanging around the class pet.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.287
I'll get you some more gum.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.488
You do that.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.190
*

16:08.301 --> 16:09.769
Can I help you?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.104
What are you doing here?

16:11.138 --> 16:13.040
Your mother rented me your room.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.442
You rented my room
to the town drunk?

16:15.475 --> 16:18.111
I am also the state drunk.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.546
(burps)

16:19.579 --> 16:20.913
What do you want?

16:21.981 --> 16:24.184
(gasps) You know?

16:24.217 --> 16:25.685
Yes. Yes, I do.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.720
Oh, son, forgive me.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.356
I'm so sorry.

16:29.389 --> 16:33.060
I just couldn't bear to lose you
like I'd lost everything else.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.629
Oh, I would've arranged for you
to live near me in the dorm.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.032
Oh, I can't live
in a college town.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.534
Can't control myself sexually.

16:41.568 --> 16:45.172
What you did to me was the worst
thing anyone could do to anyone,

16:45.205 --> 16:46.873
much less a mother to her son.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.741
I really don't know
what you could say.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.711
Son, I guess when
you get right down to it,

16:51.744 --> 16:55.648
I've always felt marching bands
are a colossal waste of time.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.251
The music and the walking
both suffer.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.419
You may have a point.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.789
And you'll always be
my little tittle.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.759
-Is that a tear?
-Maybe.

17:09.196 --> 17:10.530
(both sigh)

17:11.598 --> 17:13.500
Please, I beg you.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.202
Will you move back in?

17:15.235 --> 17:17.070
There are gonna have to be
some changes.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.871
What kind of changes?

17:18.905 --> 17:21.574
Well, I want the parental
controls taken off the TV.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.111
You'll just watch
booby programs.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.413
If I'm in the booby mood,
yes, I will.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.448
Welcome back, son.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.950
Looks like I got
a little brother!

17:30.983 --> 17:32.452
He's not staying, is he?

17:32.485 --> 17:33.853
You boys work it out.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.156
We sure will, Ma.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.129
You still haven't found Grampa?

17:42.162 --> 17:46.299
No. But I found this guy
who's willing to take his place.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.734
(Spanish accent):
I am Grandpapa.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.569
Gather the grandchildren

17:49.602 --> 17:53.206
that we might play
the Hungry Hungry Hippos.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.209
I don't think anyone can
replace our Grampa.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.877
Are you sure?
Your husband--

17:57.910 --> 18:00.313
she looked through
hundreds of grandpapas.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.615
This was my third callback!

18:02.649 --> 18:04.117
Make a choice.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.553
-(phone rings)
-Yello.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.989
Is this the no-good ungrateful
son of Abraham Simpson?

18:10.022 --> 18:11.991
-Speaking.
-I'm gonna send him back to you,

18:12.024 --> 18:13.993
and I don't want
to see him here again.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.895
This place is really depressing.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.730
And he does not help.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.833
There's a pathetic old drunk
peeing himself in the bathroom.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.101
That's a mirror.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.537
And it's not the bathroom.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.478
BART: (sighs)
When is Grampa gonna get here?

18:31.511 --> 18:32.645
GRAMPA:
I knew it.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.182
Still bad-mouthing me
behind my back.

18:35.215 --> 18:38.685
LISA: I can't believe it,
but I miss him so much.

18:38.718 --> 18:39.686
(confused grunt)

18:39.719 --> 18:41.154
BART:
I love him, too.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.790
I just can't say it to his
beautiful shriveled turnip head.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.091
Aw.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.528
I love how he knows
what every building used to be.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.230
And Maggie says...

18:52.732 --> 18:55.935
(mechanical voice):
U. R. A. D. Light.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.638
(sobbing)

19:00.307 --> 19:04.211
Come get your Grampa,
you sweet slices of melon.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.380
-Aw.
-(all sigh)

19:07.414 --> 19:09.916
Aw, we love you.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.186
Woo-hoo!

19:13.220 --> 19:14.854
D'oh!

19:17.156 --> 19:18.991
(dramatic orchestral music
playing over TV)

19:19.025 --> 19:20.227
What are you watching?

19:20.260 --> 19:21.794
It's a booby movie, isn't it?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.730
It's Emmy-winning premium cable.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.031
Do they show boobs?

19:25.064 --> 19:26.833
Not since they started
winning Emmys.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.034
Very disappointing.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.136
Well, I guess
I'll watch with you.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.404
What's that thing?

19:31.438 --> 19:33.540
It's a raven from
the Lannister's Maester.

19:33.573 --> 19:36.042
What's a Lannister?
What's a Maester?

19:36.075 --> 19:37.710
House Lannister
is the wealthiest fa...

19:37.744 --> 19:39.212
-Is that a dragon?
-Yes.

19:39.246 --> 19:40.913
This is stupid.

19:48.555 --> 19:51.190
* He walks down the street *

19:51.224 --> 19:54.327
* He falls in the hole, man *

19:54.361 --> 19:56.663
* Everyone knows Hans Moleman! *

19:56.696 --> 19:57.664
Who?

19:57.697 --> 20:00.700
Nobody knows Hans Moleman.

20:00.733 --> 20:01.701
Next.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.003
I was here first.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.004
(scanner beeps)

20:05.037 --> 20:06.038
* In the checkout line *

20:06.072 --> 20:08.341
* He doesn't even scan *

20:08.375 --> 20:10.443
* Nobody knows Hans Moleman. *

20:10.477 --> 20:13.680
I just need my heart pills.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.815
* Nobody knows Hans Moleman. *

20:56.088 --> 20:57.924
Shh!
