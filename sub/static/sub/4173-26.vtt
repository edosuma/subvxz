this a whirl.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.838

just to test it out.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.841
Hmm, I wish for an iced tea.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.344

specific enough.

10:52.886 --> 10:56.421
Oh, right, I forgot
in these kinds of stories
there's always a twist.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.922
But, but, but
I'm too smart for that.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.859
All I have to do is
be really clear
about what I want,

11:00.861 --> 11:03.895
like my next wish.
I'll be really sure
to clearly say,

11:03.897 --> 11:05.697
"I wish to control..."

11:05.699 --> 11:07.165
Aah! Cheese and crackers!

11:07.167 --> 11:08.667
(THUNDER CRACKING)

11:08.669 --> 11:09.967
Oh, you think
you're so clever,

11:09.969 --> 11:12.070
don't you,
Perry the Platypus?
Making me waste a wish?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.205
Nice try, pal.
But what you
don't realize is

11:14.407 --> 11:17.275
that this guy knows
the real waste
of a wasted wish is

11:17.277 --> 11:19.377
to waste the wish
that was wished wastefully.

11:19.545 --> 11:21.680
And I am not wasting
this wasteful wish.

11:21.682 --> 11:24.949
The point is,
I now have control
over cheese and crackers.

11:25.317 --> 11:26.918
Cheese, advance!

11:27.586 --> 11:31.423
Swiss! Smoky gouda! String!

11:31.425 --> 11:34.626
Individually wrapped
cheese food substitute!

11:34.628 --> 11:36.828
Ha! Cheese, snack attack!

11:37.363 --> 11:38.963
You, Limburger!
Hold on a second,

11:38.965 --> 11:40.063
(STUTTERS)
you're a strong cheese.

11:40.065 --> 11:41.933
Get this book shelf
off my foot.

11:56.816 --> 11:59.984
Oh, man.
If I wasn't so hungry,
this would be horrifying.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.723
Well, you may
have shredded it,
but you haven't stopped it!

12:07.927 --> 12:09.260
(LAUGHS)

12:10.963 --> 12:12.464
Uh...uh...

12:12.466 --> 12:13.965
Oh, I see.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.765
I don't know how I forgot
cheese was edible.

12:15.767 --> 12:18.903
By the way, I believe
you're over the five second
rule there, Perry the platy...

12:18.905 --> 12:19.603
Ow!

12:19.605 --> 12:22.440
Well, I hope you didn't leave
room for crackers!

12:22.608 --> 12:24.242
Crackers, go get him!

12:27.413 --> 12:29.981
Why do I have six boxes
of oyster crackers?

12:29.983 --> 12:32.584
Must have been
on sale. (GRUNTS)

12:32.818 --> 12:33.885
(CLUTTERING)

12:44.830 --> 12:46.765
Very clever,
Perry the Platypus,

12:46.767 --> 12:49.434
but let's see how you do
against the hard stuff.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.937
Parmesan, give him a taste
of your crystalline texture!

12:53.939 --> 12:54.939
(SCREECHING)

13:01.580 --> 13:03.047
(BLOWING)

13:03.049 --> 13:04.816
(ALL SQUEAKING)

13:11.991 --> 13:14.492
Ah, so you beat up
a bunch of snacks.
Big deal!

13:14.494 --> 13:16.394
But you forget,
Perry the Platypus,

13:16.396 --> 13:18.363
I still have one wish left.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.565
And I've learned
from my past two mistakes.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.667
I'm going to do
this one right!

13:22.669 --> 13:24.569
You know what it is I want,
Perry the Platypus?

13:24.571 --> 13:27.939
I want to be
the biggest ruler
of the... What?

13:28.440 --> 13:29.574
Oh, you're right!

13:29.576 --> 13:31.609
I say "ruler"
and I could end up being,

13:31.611 --> 13:33.309
like, a big wooden yardstick
or something.

13:33.311 --> 13:36.414
Good catch. Good, good catch,
Perry the Platypus.
Let me rephrase that.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.350
I want to be, specifically,
the monarch of...

13:39.352 --> 13:41.686
No, no. No, you're right,
that's a butterfly.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.788
Well, how about
the super-inten...

13:43.790 --> 13:45.590
No, no. Wait,
(STUTTERS) I know!

13:45.592 --> 13:48.593
I wish to be the head
of the Tri-State Area!

13:48.595 --> 13:50.028
Oh! Shoot!
I just heard that.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.963
(THUNDER CRACKING)

13:51.965 --> 13:53.565
Yep! (SIGHS)

13:53.567 --> 13:54.766
Yep, I'm a head.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.901
A big old head,
Perry the Platypus.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.001
That's what I wished for.

13:58.003 --> 14:01.573
Where are you going?
So, what? I don't need
your help. That's right.

14:01.575 --> 14:02.640
Just walk away,
Perry the Platypus.

14:02.642 --> 14:05.543
Oh, you're giving me
the smirk face.
Nice. Fine.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.346
Maybe I like being
a giant head, huh?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.982
Uh-oh. Oh!
I have to itch my nose!

14:10.984 --> 14:14.686
Oh, no! I can't.
Aah! (SNEEZES)

14:14.688 --> 14:15.753
(CAT MEOWING)

14:16.021 --> 14:19.023
Ow! Curse you,
Perry the Platypus!

14:19.025 --> 14:22.360
And you, too,
you giant inexplicable
floating baby head!

14:23.629 --> 14:25.563
Eh, knock it off!

14:29.935 --> 14:34.639
At dot, dot, dot, funny warts,
add the picture and...

14:34.641 --> 14:37.408
Ah! Back from
the commercial, are we?

14:37.410 --> 14:39.477
Shall I continue? Hmm.

14:39.612 --> 14:44.582
The final grim installment
in our  <i>Terrifying Tri-State</i>
<i>Trilogy of Terror</i>

14:44.584 --> 14:47.518
takes place in
an unassuming
suburban backyard

14:47.520 --> 14:50.588
<i>where five happy campers</i>
<i>and their platypus discover</i>

14:50.590 --> 14:53.791
<i>they may not know what they</i>
<i>are going to do today.</i>

14:54.126 --> 14:56.394
BUFORD: Suddenly,
from out of the shadows,

14:56.528 --> 15:00.765
the zombie bunny rabbit
appeared and then he
ate up all the marshmallows!

15:00.767 --> 15:01.900
(CHOMPING)

15:01.902 --> 15:05.169
BALJEET: Remember,
those marshmallows
are for everyone.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.071
The zombie bunny
doesn't care!

15:07.073 --> 15:09.540
Okay, it's my turn
to tell a scary story.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.540
Ooh! What's it gonna be?

15:10.542 --> 15:12.340
Suspense, stalker, horror,
action, adventure,

15:12.342 --> 15:16.014
or my personal favorite,
the campy costume alien
teen romance dramedy?

15:16.016 --> 15:17.714
Well, let's see
what's in this
weird book.

15:18.484 --> 15:22.288
"Make a doll come alive,
how to get three wishes,
giant floating rest of baby."

15:23.690 --> 15:24.488
Hey, check it out!

15:24.490 --> 15:28.159
It says here you have
to be careful not to spill
grape juice on a platypus

15:28.161 --> 15:30.595
or it will make
an evil platypus clone.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.763
I'm not really sure
why anyone would...

15:33.165 --> 15:34.499
Keep reading.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.733
Buford, stop!

15:35.868 --> 15:37.568
Aw, poor little guy.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.904
Buford, you shouldn't
pour anything on a platypus.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.606
I just wanted to see
what would happen.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.007
(CHATTERING)

15:43.208 --> 15:45.610
Well, he's dry,
but now he's purple.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.045
Whoa!

15:47.047 --> 15:48.579
Cool!
It actually worked!

15:48.581 --> 15:50.682
Who's my little
platypus clone?

15:50.684 --> 15:51.549
(GROWLS)

15:51.551 --> 15:52.549
What was that all about?

15:52.551 --> 15:55.853
What part of "evil clone"
are you not getting?

15:55.855 --> 15:58.456
Obviously, the "evil" part.

16:00.559 --> 16:03.861
I say we take off and nuke
the entire site from orbit.

16:04.063 --> 16:05.463
It's the only way
to be sure.

16:05.698 --> 16:06.898
Cheese and crackers.

16:06.900 --> 16:13.037
Oh, no! Look!
They are using our grape
juice box to make more!

16:13.539 --> 16:14.605
(ALL ROARING)

16:14.607 --> 16:19.577
Wow. This is such
a Halloween thing to happen
in the middle of summer.

16:19.579 --> 16:20.777
What are we gonna
do, Phineas?

16:20.779 --> 16:23.948
We have to contain
these duplicating
evil platypuses somehow.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.784
Uh, we could build
a vacuum that attracts
only platypus fur.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.720
No, no, then Perry
would be in danger.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.555
Uh, maybe an
alpha ray grid to...

16:30.557 --> 16:31.689
No, no, that's too much
radiation. Hmm.

16:31.691 --> 16:32.924
I can smell his
brain working.

16:33.092 --> 16:35.493
Oh, sure,
blame it on Phineas.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.895
I don't know, gang.
I'm kinda stumped
on this one.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.964
Fear not!
I know someone
who can help us.

16:39.966 --> 16:41.699
Follow me!

16:44.570 --> 16:46.704
(ALL ROARING)

16:56.982 --> 16:58.950
I don't get it, Baljeet.
Where are we going?

16:59.518 --> 17:02.053
Whenever I need
counsel on a problem,
I go to my life coach.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.187
Life coach?

17:03.189 --> 17:04.087
I am so hurt!

17:04.189 --> 17:07.659
Buford, this man is
the embodiment of
pure thought and wisdom.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.996
Well, well!
If'n it ain't Baljeet!

17:11.998 --> 17:13.865
Everyone, this
is Rusty Britches.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.700
Rusty, this is everyone.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.869
Well, I'm right pleased
to meet you kids!

17:17.871 --> 17:19.570
Wha... Howdy?

17:19.572 --> 17:22.673
Well, don't just stand there
with your hair on your head

17:22.675 --> 17:25.810
and your socks tucked into
your boots, come on in.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.046
Thank you for
the lemonade, Rusty.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.715
You're surely welcome.
Now what can I do you for?

17:30.717 --> 17:32.183
If I may, Mr. Britches.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.619
The city's been overrun
by evil platypuses,

17:34.621 --> 17:36.554
and we can't figure
out how to get rid of them.

17:36.688 --> 17:39.023
Well, that's a real beehive
in your well water.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.758
Let me get my
thinkin' bench.

17:42.127 --> 17:44.862
(CREAKING)

17:50.969 --> 17:53.304
Well, it's like
old Pap used to say.

17:53.306 --> 17:56.240
When your horse starts
drawing a bath instead
of a wagon,

17:56.575 --> 17:58.576
it's time to change
the welcome mat.

17:58.877 --> 18:00.276
Does anyone else
get the feeling

18:00.278 --> 18:02.013
we're really taking
our time with this thing?

18:02.015 --> 18:05.716
Look, Rusty, we really
appreciate your
colloquial prairie wisdom,

18:05.718 --> 18:08.152
but I think we have
to move along before
things get worse out there.

18:08.154 --> 18:10.054
Well, I reckon
you know best.

18:10.056 --> 18:13.758
It was right fine to meet...
Aw, cheese and crackers!

18:14.059 --> 18:16.227
This is supposed to be
for cleaning boats,

18:16.229 --> 18:18.362
but sometimes you gotta
wash with the wrong brush

18:18.364 --> 18:20.331
to get a colt
to the chaparral.

18:20.699 --> 18:22.166
Wash? Brush?

18:22.634 --> 18:23.733
Chaparral?

18:23.735 --> 18:26.037
That's it!
You're a genius,
Mr. Britches!

18:26.039 --> 18:29.674
Oh, shucks!
I'm just a simple
cowboy life coach.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.776
Ferb, I know what
we're gonna do today.

18:35.347 --> 18:39.383
So, since the evil platypuses
are made out of grape juice
stains and dark magic,

18:39.385 --> 18:41.819
these high-powered
bubble washers ought
to do the trick.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.822
Okay, suds up, people!
We're going platy-scrubbing!

18:44.957 --> 18:47.892

Soap's on, little tykes!

20:56.822 --> 20:59.390
Rusty, you did it!
They are all melting away!

20:59.392 --> 21:00.458
(BUGLE BLARES)

21:01.827 --> 21:03.561
You've saved my factory!

21:04.029 --> 21:06.397
Look, everyone!
It is Officer Concord,

21:06.399 --> 21:09.200
the juice-time
juice box flavor cop!

21:09.501 --> 21:11.502
Well done, everyone!
Let's dance!

21:11.504 --> 21:14.005
(MUSIC PLAYING)

21:14.007 --> 21:16.807
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:17.109 --> 21:18.309
Totally unbelievable.

21:18.311 --> 21:21.212
Which part? The unicorn
or Officer Concord,

21:21.214 --> 21:23.281
the juice-time
juice box flavor cop?

21:23.283 --> 21:24.515
Nah, the cowboy.

21:24.517 --> 21:25.950
You do not believe
in cowboys?

21:25.952 --> 21:27.985
Have you ever seen
one in real life?

21:32.024 --> 21:35.092
So, you see, if I had
a Macabre Book Mobile,

21:35.094 --> 21:37.228
those are the kinds of things
that could happen.

21:37.230 --> 21:38.429
I'm gonna be blunt,
Mr. Macabre...

21:38.431 --> 21:39.529
It's "Macabre."

21:41.166 --> 21:43.534
Mr. Macabre, I'm not gonna
give you a loan to buy
a Macabre Book Mobile.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.634
And why not?

21:44.636 --> 21:47.471
You have no detailed records
of assets, no inventory,

21:47.573 --> 21:49.440
nothing you can
use as collateral.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.542
Your stories don't
even make sense!

21:51.544 --> 21:53.444
It's a bad
business proposition.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.212
What if I were
to say "please"?

21:55.214 --> 21:56.881
That's not
gonna work.
Please?

21:56.883 --> 22:00.284
Get out.
Pretty please,
with a cherry on top?

22:00.919 --> 22:03.087
A cherry, huh?
(SIGHS)

22:03.089 --> 22:05.823
Okay, but this is
the last loan
I am giving you.

22:16.969 --> 22:20.438

(GRUNTS)

22:20.440 --> 22:22.506
I'm all right.
Hey, you go ahead
and read the credits,

22:22.508 --> 22:24.909
I'll just wait down here.

22:26.378 --> 22:27.578
It's kinda nice
down here, actually.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.281
There's a dandelion.

22:30.949 --> 22:32.550
It's all puffy
and ready to go.

22:33.051 --> 22:34.118
Here you go.

22:34.286 --> 22:36.454
(BLOWS)

22:36.456 --> 22:38.322
Logo ought to be
coming up any minute.

22:38.490 --> 22:39.990
There it is!
