36:50.960 --> 36:55.204
and the first to condone it.
Loudun is a nest of dangerous Huguenots.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.442
They outnumber we
good Catholics two to one.

36:57.520 --> 37:00.729
Every single Protestant in Loudun
remained loyal to the King and to France

37:00.800 --> 37:02.040
throughout the religious wars.

37:02.120 --> 37:05.044
Today's loyalty is no guarantee
against tomorrow's rebellion.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.521
I speak as I find.
Where is His Majesty's proclamation?

37:07.600 --> 37:12.049
Don't concern yourself with politics,
Father, your penitents are waiting.

37:17.720 --> 37:19.802
(TOLLING)

37:37.080 --> 37:39.287
MAN: Grandier! Grandier!

37:44.240 --> 37:46.368
I ask you once again,

37:46.440 --> 37:49.683
where is His Majesty's proclamation
authorizing this demolition'?

37:49.760 --> 37:53.128
For a common priest you act
uncommonly like a governor, Father.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.362
- Where is your authority?
-Here!

37:55.960 --> 37:59.282
By the authority of our late Governor,
Sainte Marthe.

37:59.960 --> 38:05.410
Assuring me full powers until such time
as a new election is held.

38:05.480 --> 38:06.481
Here!

38:06.560 --> 38:08.961
His Majesty's proclamation
has been delayed.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.691
The matter of a few days,
a mere formality.

38:11.760 --> 38:16.971
Should one more stone be torn
from our city walls, you

38:17.600 --> 38:21.002
will be dead before
it touches the ground.

-Thank you.

- Well done, Grandier.
-Well done.

-Well done, Father.

39:03.520 --> 39:04.760
(ALL EXCLAIM)

39:04.840 --> 39:07.320
It is a simple matter to understand,
Your Majesty.

39:07.400 --> 39:10.927
The self-government of the small,
provincial towns of France must cease.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.526
The first step is to pull down
all kinds of fortifications.

39:13.600 --> 39:14.647
Yes!

39:15.200 --> 39:16.884
So now it's the turn of our town.

39:16.960 --> 39:21.329
-Is everything to be torn down'?
-That is what they want.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.767
It is a trick, of course!

39:23.840 --> 39:28.971
Every time there's a so-called
nationalist revival, it means one thing,

39:29.920 --> 39:34.209
somebody is trying to seize control
of the entire country.

39:35.360 --> 39:39.365
The significance of our walls
is that we are self-governing!

39:39.440 --> 39:40.566
CROWD: Yes!

39:40.640 --> 39:42.244
Richelieu hates this.

39:42.840 --> 39:45.047
He deceives the King.

39:45.960 --> 39:49.726
If France is to fulfill her own destiny,
she must be free within herself.

39:49.800 --> 39:50.961
Yes!

39:51.320 --> 39:56.247
Ignorant and crafty provincials like us

39:56.320 --> 39:59.244
cannot see beyond the city walls.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.527
And so they are ordered to be torn down.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.925
Will it broaden our view'?

40:05.440 --> 40:07.363
Such men, sire, have little vision.

40:07.440 --> 40:10.046
Their loyalties are to their cities,
not to France.

40:10.120 --> 40:11.406
Yes!

40:11.720 --> 40:16.282
When a man is intent on power,
as Richelieu is,

40:17.160 --> 40:21.449
he can justify his actions
with absurdities.

40:22.600 --> 40:26.924
Fortifications provide opportunities
for Protestant uprising.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.126
Yes!

40:28.560 --> 40:32.724
With our walls gone,
we shall be defenseless,

40:33.600 --> 40:38.208
at the mercy of any enemy, as weak

40:38.280 --> 40:41.409
and as helpless as a country village.

40:42.560 --> 40:46.485
And with the security
of our independence gone,

40:46.560 --> 40:49.291
our freedoms would go, too.

40:50.560 --> 40:54.610
We must write to the King,

it's not surprising your priest

45:56.280 --> 45:58.408
If he were allowed to become

54:26.840 --> 54:28.080
Yes, Father.

I had a vision. I saw a man
walking across the waters of a lake.

To continue the evidence,

1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:56.725
my lords,

1:23:58.080 --> 1:24:01.482
we have heard testimony
from sober citizens,

1:24:01.560 --> 1:24:05.724
saying how they were bewitched by you
into attending a black Mass.

swearing again and again
that the accused is a sorcerer!

1:24:16.760 --> 1:24:20.810
And since, when duly constrained
by Holy Exorcist,

1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:24.487
the Devil is bound to tell the truth,
it follows that...

1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:25.686
Lies!

1:24:26.440 --> 1:24:27.930
Lies and heresy!

The Devil is a liar
and the father of lies.

If the Devil's evidence
is to be accepted,

1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:38.171
the virtuous people
are in the greatest of danger.

1:24:49.320 --> 1:24:51.448
But the Devil has spoken!

1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:53.488
And to doubt his word

1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:55.971

1:32:39.880 --> 1:32:41.166
Tell me,

1:32:41.440 --> 1:32:43.488
do you love the Church?

1:32:45.280 --> 1:32:46.327
Not today.

1:32:46.400 --> 1:32:48.482
LAUBARDEMONT: Do you want
to see it grow more powerful?

1:32:48.560 --> 1:32:52.645
More benevolent, until it embraces
every human soul on this earth?

1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:57.289
Then help us to achieve
this great purpose.

1:32:57.360 --> 1:33:00.728
Go to the marketplace a penitent man.
Confess.

1:33:00.800 --> 1:33:03.041
And by confessing,
proclaim to those thousands

1:33:03.120 --> 1:33:05.521
that you have returned
to the Church's arms.

1:33:06.760 --> 1:33:10.606
By going to the stake unrepentant,
you do God a disservice.

1:33:10.680 --> 1:33:12.489
You give hope to unbelievers.

1:33:12.560 --> 1:33:15.564
Such an act can mine
the very foundations of the Church.

1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:19.281
You are no longer important.

1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:23.004
Well, think.
Are you any longer important?

1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:26.291
I was never

1:33:27.880 --> 1:33:28.881
important.

1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:33.010
Then make a last supreme gesture
for the Catholic faith.

1:33:35.920 --> 1:33:38.207
Go away, Laubardemont.

1:33:38.280 --> 1:33:40.248
You are becoming tedious.

1:33:41.440 --> 1:33:44.842
Do you know that the King has gone back
on his word because of your crimes?

1:33:44.920 --> 1:33:48.845
The walls will come down,
the city will be destroyed. We have won.

1:33:48.920 --> 1:33:50.922
- You have lost!
-Won!

1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:52.240
Sign it!

1:33:53.400 --> 1:33:54.845
You will sign.

1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:29.526
Get up.

1:34:31.640 --> 1:34:33.165
What is this place?

1:34:33.240 --> 1:34:35.083
The convent of St Ursula.

1:34:35.160 --> 1:34:37.288
The place you have defiled.

1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:38.691
Do what must be done.

1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:44.485
(GROANING)

1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:50.604
Ask forgiveness of Sister Jeanne
and these good women you have wronged.

1:34:51.640 --> 1:34:53.688
I have done no such thing.

1:34:56.240 --> 1:34:57.810
I could only ask

1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:01.849
God will forgive them.

1:35:06.680 --> 1:35:08.967
He always spoke of your beauty.

1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:14.523
Now I see it with my own eyes
and know it's true.

1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:20.002
Look at this thing that I am

1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:23.682
and learn the meaning of love.

1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:28.323
Devil.

1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:32.321
Devil!

1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:35.920

BARRE: Forgive us, O God, who condemned
thee and Judas lscariot, the traitor.

1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:55.847
For he presses on thee
with perpetual flame,

1:35:55.920 --> 1:36:00.847
who shall see the end of time to the
wicked, cursed into everlasting fire,

1:36:00.920 --> 1:36:04.003
which is prepared for the Devil
and his angels.

1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:08.768
For thee, this one and the angels are
prepared worms which never die.

1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:10.763
Thou art the chief of accursed murder,

1:36:10.840 --> 1:36:15.448
thou are the author of incest,
the head of sacrilege,

1:36:15.520 --> 1:36:18.603

the teacher of heretics.

I must ask your forgiveness, priest,
for what I must do.

1:36:36.280 --> 1:36:38.328
But you can make a speech if you like.

1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:41.165
And before the fire is lit,
I shall strangle you.

1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:43.561
It will be quick, I promise you.

1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:50.249

I have finished confessing.

Give me the kiss of peace
and let me die.

1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:17.011
Kiss the Devil'? Kiss the evil fiend'?

He's off to Poitiers.

He's quite demented.

destroyed an innocent man.

to prove otherwise,

everyone has the same opinion.

Pity, that.

No, with Grandier gone,
you are no longer possessed.

- It's simple.
-What shall I do'?

Stay here quietly, of course.

1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:43.445
What else?

1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:46.611
Well, there'll be a few tourists
occasionally to brighten things up.

1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:51.447
But that won't last long. Soon the town
will die, you will be left in peace

1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:53.124
and oblivion.

1:42:53.680 --> 1:42:55.842
Oh, I almost forgot.
