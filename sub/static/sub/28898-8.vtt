WEBVTT

00:16.050 --> 00:17.170
Go ahead, Rue.

00:17.420 --> 00:19.380
I met someone.

00:19.880 --> 00:20.840
She's helped.

00:21.130 --> 00:23.210
Now, I want to stay clean.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.710
So, thank you.

00:28.050 --> 00:29.460
I'm really proud of you, Rue.

00:29.540 --> 00:31.750
You've come a long way.

00:32.210 --> 00:33.880
Just take your time.

00:34.250 --> 00:35.210
You're delicate.

00:35.710 --> 00:38.540
Every time I feel good,
I think it'll last forever.

00:42.540 --> 00:44.290
These states will wax and wane.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.380
I think I need your help.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.290
In bad times,
there would be good times.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.960
But also, in the good times...

00:56.050 --> 00:57.460
You're fucking dead to me.

00:57.540 --> 00:58.880
There would be bad times.

00:59.630 --> 01:00.750
You look different.

01:01.290 --> 01:02.590
I miss the old Kat.

01:03.460 --> 01:05.170
Leave Rue and her friends alone.

01:05.250 --> 01:06.210
Is that a threat?

01:07.000 --> 01:10.050
I guess it's true.
Life is always this way.

01:10.920 --> 01:14.130
You're okay, baby.
You're okay.

01:26.210 --> 01:28.710
One of the benefits
of showing up at the hospital

01:28.800 --> 01:30.840
in the middle of the night
with a kidney infection

01:30.920 --> 01:33.000
is that the first thing
they do...

01:33.090 --> 01:34.710
Take this with
a full cup of water.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.840
...is give you something
to bring down your fever

01:36.920 --> 01:39.170
and subdue the agonizing pain
you're in.

01:39.250 --> 01:41.500
- Is this Vicodin?
- Yes.

01:44.420 --> 01:47.380
- Five milligrams?
- Uh, yes.

01:47.460 --> 01:49.840
I know what you're all thinking.

01:51.380 --> 01:54.380
I, um, I got my wisdom teeth
taken out, like, a year ago,

01:54.460 --> 01:55.800
and they gave me Vicodin.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.630
It... It just wasn't...
It wasn't good for me.

01:57.710 --> 02:00.710
It really, really
upsets my stomach.

02:00.800 --> 02:03.920
- Oh. Okay.
- Yeah.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.630
- I think I'll just go with plain Tylenol.
- Are you sure?

02:07.710 --> 02:10.130
Kidney infections
are extremely painful.

02:10.500 --> 02:12.130
I'm sure.

02:13.210 --> 02:15.750
Unless...

02:15.840 --> 02:18.750
I can't quite remember
what they put me on instead.

02:18.840 --> 02:22.250
It was, like... I don't know,
it sounded like a candy name.

02:22.340 --> 02:24.500
It was like, uh, like Roxi...

02:24.590 --> 02:26.380
- like Roxis...
- Roxicet?

02:26.460 --> 02:30.170
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
Roxicet. Yeah.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.750
I'll go with that.
7.5 milligrams.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.000
- Okay. Let me check with the doctor.
- Thanks.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.590
It's not a relapse
if it's warranted.

02:39.670 --> 02:40.960
It's a hall pass.

02:41.050 --> 02:42.630
God, please don't get
in the way.

02:42.710 --> 02:44.750
According to the paperwork
that your mother filled out,

02:44.840 --> 02:47.630
it appears that you have some pretty
extreme substance abuse issues.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.670
So, I think you're right.

02:49.750 --> 02:52.170
We should just
stick with Tylenol.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.960
Huh. Okay, yeah.

02:55.050 --> 02:58.710
You know, if I ever
come back here with cancer,

02:58.800 --> 03:01.210
I really hope
you're not my doctor.

03:01.290 --> 03:04.840
Uh-huh, yeah, I'm serious.

03:05.380 --> 03:08.960
Wait. Can I...
Can I still get the Vicodin?

03:09.050 --> 03:12.420
They put me on Cipro,
which is the antibiotic they give to people

03:12.500 --> 03:14.460
that are exposed to anthrax,

03:14.540 --> 03:17.340
started me on Lexapro,
which is one of the few antidepressants

03:17.420 --> 03:20.170
that doesn't make me crazier.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.840
And kept me there
for three days.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.960
It was actually really nice.

03:26.050 --> 03:27.880
I love hospitals.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.750
If I could spend the rest of
my life in a hospital, I would.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.750
Hey.
Because when you're in a hospital,

03:32.840 --> 03:36.670
you have zero responsibilities.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.750
They make sure you eat,
sleep, stay hydrated,

03:39.840 --> 03:42.750
and if anything bad happens,
there's always a doctor nearby.

03:42.840 --> 03:43.920
Thank you.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.500
It's also the best place to be

03:45.590 --> 03:47.670
in the event of a mass shooting,

03:47.750 --> 03:51.050
unless the gunman kills
all the surgeons.

03:51.130 --> 03:53.590
The point is,
I had zero anxiety.

03:53.670 --> 03:56.500
Gel enhancement,
gel enhancement nails.

03:56.590 --> 03:59.290
- What are gel enhancement nails?
- Fake nails?

03:59.380 --> 04:03.050
Yes, fake nails.

04:03.130 --> 04:06.170
Then at nighttime,
when everyone's asleep,

04:06.250 --> 04:10.590
I close my eyes and imagine all the
little beeps to be the sounds of birds,

04:10.670 --> 04:14.840
and the lukewarm air blowing through
the vent to be a warm breeze.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.750
Your hospital bed can sort
of feel like a poolside chair

04:17.839 --> 04:20.709
on a hot summer night
in the Caribbean.

04:24.460 --> 04:26.630
Plus, Jules came to visit.

04:29.250 --> 04:32.210
Did all this happen
because I left?

04:32.290 --> 04:33.920
No.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.090
You promise?

04:39.840 --> 04:41.670
Yeah, I promise.

04:42.670 --> 04:45.420
I've felt like this
my whole life, Jules.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.800
Not all the time, but sometimes.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
You make it better, though.

05:02.170 --> 05:03.800
I'm sorry.

05:05.670 --> 05:07.210
For what?

05:10.750 --> 05:12.800
For not telling you the truth.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.590
For everyone who was
calling me manic,

05:15.670 --> 05:18.540
I was, like, 92 percent correct.

05:18.630 --> 05:21.710
But something was different
about Jules.

05:22.670 --> 05:26.050
Rue, you look fucking amazing.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.210
Jules, I am deeply
uncomfortable right now.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.170
Listen, you look hot.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.800
And the fact that you usually
dress like Seth Rogen,

05:36.880 --> 05:41.460
although you make it cute
sometimes, like, it crushes my soul.

05:41.540 --> 05:43.960
I don't dress like Seth Rogen.

05:44.050 --> 05:46.630
When was the last time you didn't
wear a hoodie and sweatpants?

05:46.710 --> 05:49.130
I don't know,
like... now.

05:49.210 --> 05:53.540
Exactly. Which is
why we're gonna finish.

05:53.960 --> 05:58.380
It was, like,
the most amazing weekend ever.

05:58.460 --> 06:01.750
I legit cannot stop thinking
about it, you know.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.420
It was, like, the first time...

06:04.500 --> 06:08.460
I ever felt like I had a family,

06:08.540 --> 06:13.000
that wasn't my dad,
or, like, you, kind of.

06:13.380 --> 06:15.800
And, oh, my God.
Rue...

06:15.880 --> 06:19.210
you would die for Anna.

06:19.290 --> 06:23.920
- Who's Anna?
- She's just, like, next level.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.250
I don't know.

06:25.340 --> 06:28.210
Did you guys, like,
hook up or something?

06:28.290 --> 06:31.500
Yeah.
It was kind of crazy.

06:31.590 --> 06:33.710
We went to the club,

06:33.800 --> 06:36.840
and the energy was, like,
crazy in there.

06:36.920 --> 06:39.750
It, like, matched hers,
and then I was feelin' it.

06:39.840 --> 06:43.170
And she just, like,
grabbed me and sort of like,

06:43.250 --> 06:47.170
pushed me down,
and like, kissed me.

06:47.250 --> 06:49.710
And... she fuckin' bit me.

06:49.800 --> 06:55.090
- What do you mean she bit you?
- Like, when we were hooking up, she, like, fully bit me.

06:55.170 --> 06:57.250
Look.

06:58.130 --> 07:00.290
Oh. Okay.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.800
- Did it, like, feel good?
- Yeah, it felt amazing.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.250
That's it, she just...

07:06.340 --> 07:08.960
Has anyone ever
done that to you?

07:09.050 --> 07:10.500
No.

07:10.590 --> 07:14.130
- Do you want to see what it feels like?
- I don't know.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.590
- Ow!
- What?

07:18.670 --> 07:20.670
- Ow!
- You don't like it?

07:20.750 --> 07:22.290
I don't think so.

07:23.670 --> 07:25.170
I see.

07:25.670 --> 07:27.380
But you like it.

07:27.460 --> 07:28.960
I liked it.

07:29.050 --> 07:31.460
I don't know.
You've gotta meet these kids.

07:31.540 --> 07:36.340
'Cause I swear, you would
fuckin' flourish in that energy.

07:37.340 --> 07:40.170
I've never felt
anything like it.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.840
There. Mm.

07:44.670 --> 07:46.800
I missed you so much.

07:56.250 --> 07:58.170
You look beautiful.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.050
Thanks. You, too.

08:03.590 --> 08:06.880
By the way, fuck Nate Jacobs.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.250
- Fuck Nate Jacobs.
- Mm-hmm.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.710
I know you're not supposed to
say this kind of shit out loud,

08:12.800 --> 08:14.840
but if I ever had the chance
I would fuckin'...

08:21.960 --> 08:24.290
What a fuckin' pussy.

Hi. I'm Leslie, Rue's mom.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.540
Hi, Leslie.

08:58.880 --> 09:04.090
They asked me to write a letter about what
your addiction has cost us as a family,

09:04.590 --> 09:09.130
and as I sat down last night
to write it,

09:10.500 --> 09:13.750
I couldn't stop thinking
about the day you were born.

09:15.130 --> 09:18.750
Holding you in my arms
for the first time,

09:18.840 --> 09:21.090
looking down at you,

09:21.880 --> 09:24.340
your sweet, beautiful face...

09:24.750 --> 09:29.800
I had never felt so much
love and joy in my entire life.

09:30.630 --> 09:32.460
And I thought that...

09:33.210 --> 09:36.670
what if in that moment
I heard a voice,

09:36.750 --> 09:39.500
some omniscient narrator
who said,

09:39.590 --> 09:41.880
"Here's what's going to happen.

09:41.960 --> 09:47.800
"Your daughter is gonna be
funny, and smart, and outgoing,

09:47.880 --> 09:50.340
You'll see it instantly,
from a young age."

09:50.420 --> 09:53.840
- Are you guys drinking wine?
- I mean, barely.

09:54.630 --> 09:57.800
We were waiting for you to leave so
we could get into the hard stuff.

10:01.250 --> 10:04.250
That's cool.
I'm not triggered or anything.

10:04.840 --> 10:07.630
Aah.
It's a joke.

10:07.710 --> 10:09.710
Okay, let's take
some pictures. Come on.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.880
"She'll be charismatic
and make friends easily."

10:12.960 --> 10:15.170
Aw, you guys look so cute.

10:15.250 --> 10:18.130
"She'll be kind and sensitive.

10:19.050 --> 10:21.500
"Maybe too sensitive.

10:22.290 --> 10:25.500
"She won't be an easy child.

10:26.130 --> 10:28.460
She'll struggle."

10:30.340 --> 10:33.050
Just walk in,

10:33.130 --> 10:35.590
and hold your head
up high, baby.

10:35.670 --> 10:40.420
"And in turn, you'll struggle
to understand her."

10:40.500 --> 10:44.500
- You look beautiful.
- I don't know.

10:46.050 --> 10:49.710
"To understand what's going on
inside of her head.

10:49.800 --> 10:53.210
"The night terrors
that can't be interrupted.

10:56.420 --> 10:58.920
"The times after dinner where

10:59.000 --> 11:03.590
"she'll just sit at the kitchen table
and count the tiles over and over,

11:03.670 --> 11:05.960
"until she hyperventilates."

11:08.460 --> 11:11.960
- Do you have a... a date?
- No.

11:12.050 --> 11:16.500
"To fight to hold her in your
arms, to tell her it's okay."

11:16.590 --> 11:19.050
Do you think this makes me
look stupid?

11:20.710 --> 11:23.380
No, not in the least.

11:26.050 --> 11:29.800
- "To calm down. The kicking.
- The screaming.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.880
"The anxiety of being harmed.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.670
"The transitions
from day to night,

11:36.750 --> 11:41.290
"from home to school,
from meal to meal.

11:41.380 --> 11:45.750
Of losing her mother
or father or little sister."

11:45.840 --> 11:47.340
Hey.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.340
You guys have such a beautiful home.
Aw, thank you.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.420
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.290
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

11:56.380 --> 11:58.590
- That's an understatement.
- "Of being alone."

11:58.670 --> 12:00.420
Hey. I really like her.

12:00.500 --> 12:05.000
"The panic attacks, mood swings,
confusion, disorganization."

12:05.090 --> 12:07.590
- Have fun, mija.
- I will.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.420
- Look at you!
- Oh, my God!

12:17.210 --> 12:20.050
"And all that rage.

12:20.130 --> 12:23.670
"Not just at you,
but at herself.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.210
"And the tough part is..."

12:25.290 --> 12:26.630
Aah!

12:27.500 --> 12:29.170
You want some, Cass?

12:29.250 --> 12:32.710
"...you'll feel as helpless to
help her as she does herself."

12:32.800 --> 12:35.050
- What is it?
- Gatorade and Everclear.

12:35.130 --> 12:38.050
- "You'll make mistakes.
- Small ones and big ones."

12:38.130 --> 12:40.000
Fuck it.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.880
Fuck it. Aah.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.710
"You'll look for help
from people who aren't helpful.

12:45.800 --> 12:49.420
"Or who don't actually
understand what's happening."

12:57.630 --> 13:00.920
"And the guilt will
never leave you."

13:04.290 --> 13:06.500
Love you, Grandma.

13:11.250 --> 13:14.050
"But if you remain
calm and patient,

13:14.130 --> 13:16.290
"if you listen closely,

13:16.380 --> 13:18.380
"you'll begin
to understand her more."

13:18.460 --> 13:20.090
You okay?

13:20.170 --> 13:22.420
Yeah, I'm just having
an asthma thing.

13:22.500 --> 13:28.340
"The counting, the repetition,
the need for symmetry.

13:28.420 --> 13:31.290
"That if you kiss her
left cheek before bed,

13:31.380 --> 13:33.250
"you have to kiss
her right cheek.

13:33.340 --> 13:36.920
"And her forehead.
Then her chin.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.920
"That it's about balance,
stability.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.710
"The need to organize her
feelings and thoughts, so...

13:44.800 --> 13:47.000
she can breathe easier."

13:47.090 --> 13:50.290
- I feel really good about tonight.
- Really?

13:50.380 --> 13:52.250
Yeah. I mean...

13:52.340 --> 13:54.000
I was thinking
this is the first time

13:54.090 --> 13:56.340
since the beginning of high
school that I haven't, like,

13:56.420 --> 13:57.800
been in love with somebody.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.340
Honestly, I love that for you.

14:02.750 --> 14:06.210
I've always, like,
really been into pickup trucks.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.880
You can take your shoes
off the dash.

14:18.540 --> 14:20.920
"And there will be
moments of relief...

14:21.000 --> 14:23.290
"...in her and in you."

14:23.380 --> 14:27.210
"Moments that feel so normal
and calm, and rewarding

14:27.290 --> 14:31.340
"that you'll find yourself
praying they last forever."

14:33.960 --> 14:36.710
"Even though she's only a child,

14:36.800 --> 14:40.460
and all the hard parts
have yet to even come."

14:44.920 --> 14:46.290
Kat.
Hi.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.420
Wow.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.170
♪ He take me shopping,

15:31.250 --> 15:34.420
What if these are, like,
the big moments in life?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.380
Like, my mom always talks
about how high school was

15:37.460 --> 15:39.380
like this big, monumental
part of her life.

15:39.460 --> 15:43.290
But I cannot imagine being 40 and
looking back at this, like, "Wow."

15:43.380 --> 15:46.170
Yeah, but that's because most
people peak in high school.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.540
I definitely
haven't peaked, so...

15:48.630 --> 15:50.210
I feel like I'm not even
a person yet.

15:50.290 --> 15:53.380
Yeah, I'm definitely at, like,
25 percent peakness.

15:53.460 --> 15:56.420
I feel like I'm at a hundred.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.090
But I can definitely get to 150.

15:59.170 --> 16:01.670
Honestly, I never thought
I'd make it this far.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.540
What do you mean?

16:03.630 --> 16:05.170
I don't know.
I just always had, like,

16:05.250 --> 16:07.960
this overwhelming anxiety
that something bad would happen.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.920
In all fairness,
last summer, there were, like,

16:10.000 --> 16:11.920
three weeks where
I thought you were dead.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.670
Okay, but she's been sober
for, like, three months.

16:14.750 --> 16:18.000
Weren't you in rehab,
like, six months ago?

16:19.250 --> 16:22.750
Uh, yeah.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.880
Maybe people are nostalgic
about high school

16:24.960 --> 16:27.920
'cause it's, like, the last time in
their life that they get to dream.

16:29.670 --> 16:35.210
After this is just bad jobs,
and bills, and bad husbands.

16:38.050 --> 16:41.090
Maybe I'm generalizing, but...

16:41.170 --> 16:43.500
I don't know.
Do you guys get what I mean?

16:44.210 --> 16:46.500
I don't know.
I kind of feel the opposite.

16:46.590 --> 16:50.340
I feel like high school's
super fucking suffocating.

16:50.420 --> 16:53.340
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:55.050 --> 16:56.710
Hmm.

16:59.210 --> 17:01.130

- Just a second.
- Are you, like, not hard?

17:53.420 --> 17:55.380
Not yet. Fuck.

17:55.460 --> 17:59.540
It... It doesn't really feel
like you're hard. I am. I'm...

17:59.630 --> 18:02.500
- I am hard.
- Nate, this isn't something you just, like, lie about.

18:02.590 --> 18:04.380
Maddy, I just got a lot of shit
on my mind, okay?

18:04.460 --> 18:06.540
- Like right now?
- Like, during sex?

18:06.630 --> 18:08.050
- Maddy, stop.
- Stop what?

18:08.130 --> 18:10.540
Talking. Stop talking.
Fuck.

18:10.630 --> 18:12.800
Okay, I'm officially turned off.
Just get off me.

18:12.880 --> 18:16.000
- Why the fuck are we even having sex?
- We weren't.

18:16.090 --> 18:17.750
You know what your
fucking problem is?

18:17.840 --> 18:20.130
You can't keep
your fucking mouth shut.

18:20.210 --> 18:21.710
Yeah, and you can't keep
your dick hard.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.670
Maybe the reason I can't keep
my dick hard is because

18:23.750 --> 18:26.000
everyone at school is spreading
these fucking rumors about me.

18:26.090 --> 18:28.210
- They're not rumors.
- They're facts.

18:28.290 --> 18:31.290
You literally had, like,
40 different guys' dicks in your phone.

18:31.380 --> 18:33.840
- I told you not to fucking tell anyone.
- Yeah, well, I told people

18:33.920 --> 18:35.250
before you told me
not to tell anyone.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.000
Yeah, but you told them
out of fucking context.

18:37.090 --> 18:39.250
Really?
What is the context?

18:39.340 --> 18:41.750
I'd tell you, but I don't even
fucking trust you anymore.

18:41.840 --> 18:44.290
Kind of like how you fuck me,
but you're not hard anymore?

18:44.380 --> 18:48.210
Huh? Keep talking.
Come on, keep fucking talking.

18:48.290 --> 18:50.290
Keep talking. Huh?

18:57.540 --> 19:00.710
Look, Nate, I don't mind
if you're into guys.

19:00.800 --> 19:04.210
- I'm not into fucking guys, Maddy.
- Sexuality is a spectrum.

19:04.290 --> 19:06.590
- Fuck. What the fuck are you talking about?
- It's not like anyone's

19:06.670 --> 19:09.290
100 percent straight
or 100 percent gay.

19:09.380 --> 19:11.960
Oh, that is 100 percent
bullshit.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.960
Hey, look,
I don't really know you.

20:01.050 --> 20:03.290
You might be a good girl,
you might not.

20:03.380 --> 20:05.380
But I do know my son.

20:06.050 --> 20:08.800
- Do you?
- I'm not defending him.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.880
But I do want to protect him,
and what I know is this relationship

20:11.960 --> 20:14.380
you two have is not sustainable,

20:14.840 --> 20:18.170
and it's only a matter of time
before it takes the both of you down.

20:18.250 --> 20:22.050
Sometimes two people in the universe
who aren't meant for each other

20:22.130 --> 20:24.090
find each other.

20:24.170 --> 20:27.960
You're a beautiful girl,
and a smart one.

20:28.800 --> 20:32.000
It's time to let go.

20:32.630 --> 20:36.210
Your whole family
is so fucking weird.

21:06.960 --> 21:09.210
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is it.

21:09.290 --> 21:11.420
This is the game you've
all been waiting for.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.380
- That's right, Bart.
- This is the first game back

21:13.460 --> 21:15.710
for the Hawks starting QB
Nate Jacobs.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.500
It could be the final game
of his high school career

21:18.590 --> 21:20.380
unless he can bring home the W,

21:20.460 --> 21:22.380
and get this struggling team
to regionals.

21:22.460 --> 21:25.380
Speaking of struggles,
he's had a lot off the field.

21:25.460 --> 21:27.460
- It's been a big topic of conversation...
- Come on, Hawks!

21:27.540 --> 21:29.880
...not only around the team,
but also in this community.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.880
Can he overcome this?

21:31.960 --> 21:34.590
I think Nate Jacobs is gonna
unify this ball club.

21:34.670 --> 21:36.710
Thankfully his teammates
have his back.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.460
We know the community
has his back.

21:38.540 --> 21:41.460
How much of the game is he
going to put on his back? Play!

21:41.540 --> 21:43.750
Here we go. It's game time.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.250
Red, twelve.

21:45.340 --> 21:47.540
Red, twelve. Hut.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.670
Maddy, don't.

22:14.340 --> 22:17.750
- Maddy. Don't do it.
- Fuck this.

22:24.460 --> 22:26.380
Can you dance?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.380
Um...

22:31.170 --> 22:34.000
- Can you dance?
- Fuck, yeah.

22:53.670 --> 22:56.340
I guarantee you Maddy and Nate
are gonna get married.

22:56.420 --> 22:59.340
And probably, like, divorced three
times, and in some strange way,

22:59.420 --> 23:01.960
live a pretty happy life.

23:02.460 --> 23:04.880
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.590
Yeah.

23:33.590 --> 23:34.960
Jules!

23:39.880 --> 23:41.420
Jules.

23:43.340 --> 23:45.880
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.840
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

23:51.090 --> 23:53.000
I like the way I dressed you,
but I'm worried

23:53.090 --> 23:55.250
I fucked with
your gender expression.

23:55.340 --> 23:58.130
Thank you?

23:59.170 --> 24:02.920
I feel a little stupid, so...

24:06.380 --> 24:08.960
Can I ask you a question?

24:09.540 --> 24:13.590
- Yeah.
- Why don't you kiss me?

24:16.250 --> 24:18.130
I kiss you.

24:18.670 --> 24:22.880
No. Why don't you, like,
kiss-kiss me?

24:24.000 --> 24:29.340
Um, I mean, did you want me
to, like, kiss-kiss you?

24:32.880 --> 24:34.750
I want you...

24:34.840 --> 24:38.340
to wanna kiss me so bad
that you don't even ask.

24:47.540 --> 24:49.960

and I'm so, so sorry.
It's...

27:20.670 --> 27:24.130
But that night at the carnival when you
were flirting with that girl, I just...

27:24.710 --> 27:28.380
I don't know. I just had, like,
this reaction, and I just, like, hated you.

27:29.460 --> 27:32.630
Whether that's fair or not,
I don't know. I...

27:34.880 --> 27:37.050
But, um...
I guess I just...

27:37.130 --> 27:41.250
I guess I just wanted to hurt you
as much as I imagined you'd hurt me.

27:41.340 --> 27:44.000
And I know that sounds
juvenile, but it's true,

27:44.090 --> 27:45.920
and I wouldn't even be
saying this to you,

27:46.000 --> 27:47.540
because you're actually
not like this.

27:47.630 --> 27:50.170
You're actually really kind,
and you're actually really nice,

27:50.250 --> 27:53.500
and I'm just... I just...
I'm so shitty,

27:53.590 --> 27:56.050
and I just wish I could
go back...

27:56.130 --> 27:58.710
Kat, I liked you since
I sat down next to you.

27:59.380 --> 28:01.590
You know, and I know that you think
there's, like, zero chance

28:01.670 --> 28:04.340
that we're gonna be
together forever, and, uh...

28:05.340 --> 28:06.960
I don't know.
I guess, we're both juniors,

28:07.050 --> 28:09.380
so you're probably right
about that.

28:10.670 --> 28:14.210
You know, I mean, like,
is one of us gonna get hurt?

28:15.540 --> 28:18.380
Yeah. Probably.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
But I'll do my best
to make sure that it's me.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.340
I'm crying.

28:29.420 --> 28:31.750
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.920
- Sorry. Was that awkward?

bad things happen to you.

34:07.380 --> 34:10.170
You've never done anything
illegal, Nate?

34:10.250 --> 34:11.670

your friend Jules?

34:11.750 --> 34:14.210
No, actually,
I'm talking about your dad.

34:32.460 --> 34:35.540
- What do you want, Rue?
- I want you to leave Fez alone.

34:35.630 --> 34:37.460
I want you to leave Jules alone.

again, I'll destroy your life.

I'll destroy your dad's life. I'll fucking
burn your whole shit to the ground.

34:44.750 --> 34:48.130
'Cause I personally have no problem
walking into any police station

34:48.210 --> 34:51.380
and telling them
that Nate Jacobs's daddy

34:51.460 --> 34:53.960
likes to fuck little kids.

34:57.130 --> 34:59.210
You look very pretty tonight.

34:59.960 --> 35:03.210

told you everything?

35:03.290 --> 35:05.380
You know what I like about her?

35:05.460 --> 35:07.880
She has these very real dreams.

35:07.960 --> 35:11.670
And I seriously think that
she's going to achieve them.

35:14.170 --> 35:16.380
If you look at everyone inside,

35:16.460 --> 35:18.290
most of them are going to go on

35:18.380 --> 35:22.800
to lives these lives that aren't
even fucking worth mentioning.

35:23.540 --> 35:25.250
Not Jules.

35:26.050 --> 35:27.920
What about you?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.670
Honestly,

35:30.420 --> 35:33.710
- I don't really give a fuck.
- Yeah, I gathered that.

35:34.380 --> 35:37.380
That's probably why you're spending all your
time with someone who's going to leave you

35:37.460 --> 35:40.340
and won't even remember who
the fuck you are in ten years.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.880

You, uh...

35:47.960 --> 35:50.250

the final play of the game.

36:04.170 --> 36:06.710

36:17.590 --> 36:19.960
Oh, he's off, he's off!
He's going!

36:20.050 --> 36:22.710
He's taking the game into his own hands.
There he goes!

36:22.800 --> 36:26.340
He's at the 30, he's at the 20.
I think he's gonna do it.

36:26.420 --> 36:29.960
He's at the line!
Yes! He made it!

36:58.920 --> 37:00.340
You may have won the game,

37:00.420 --> 37:02.590
but you lost control
of the team.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.460
And in the long run.
if you don't lead, you're gonna lose.

37:27.210 --> 37:29.710

a step back, Nate.
