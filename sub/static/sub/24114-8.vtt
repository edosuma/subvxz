WEBVTT

00:08.008 --> 00:09.300
<i>Previously on You Me Her...</i>

00:09.384 --> 00:10.969
I see you, Nina Martone.

00:11.052 --> 00:13.805
Andy is relentlessly posting
photos of him and his dad

00:13.888 --> 00:16.766
having a smile-off
somewhere in the woods.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.768
Say, has anyone ever written
a thesis about

00:18.852 --> 00:20.895
excessive cyber stalking
of ex

00:20.979 --> 00:22.105
-Iz.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.566
I'm pregnant.
This just feels right.

00:24.649 --> 00:27.819
And I don't wanna fuck it up.
I cannot fuck this up again.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.614
-Oh!
-Oh, no.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.075
I was gonna sneak out and catch
<i>Pillow Talk</i> at the Paramount.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.952
And you're welcome
to tag along if you want.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.747
Are you seriously asking me
on a date right now?

00:38.830 --> 00:40.457
Absolutely not. I already work insane hours
at Pinnacle.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.044
And if I make partner,
it's gonna be even worse, so...

00:45.128 --> 00:48.339
I was assuming you were coming home,
not coming to get us.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.758
And as long as we're being honest,

00:49.841 --> 00:51.384
I miss Hawthorne Heights.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.720
I'd rather sleep
under a fucking bridge.

00:53.803 --> 00:56.765
<i>They want in.</i>
<i>Offices, staff, the whole nine.</i>

00:56.848 --> 00:58.349
Oh, my God.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.518
I guess shit just got real, huh?

01:00.602 --> 01:02.145
It's okay. We'll figure it out.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.608
What if you really are
Mr. Right There in Front of Me?

01:06.691 --> 01:08.693
-Hey. Whoa, fuck, hold up.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.089
Were you guys just about to kiss?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.093
Hey.

01:34.552 --> 01:35.720
Andy's back.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.931
He was...

01:39.098 --> 01:42.018
And now he's standing there
right in front of us looking like...

01:43.102 --> 01:44.646
Looking like he could use a cold beer.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.773
Would you... would you like
a cold beer, Andy?

01:48.316 --> 01:50.944
Yeah, I'm gonna take that as a yes.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.155
No disrespect, uh...

01:56.741 --> 01:58.076
-Oh, it's still Shaun.

01:58.159 --> 02:00.328
Yeah, no disrespect, Shaun,

02:00.829 --> 02:03.540
but, uh, can I talk to you privately?

02:09.087 --> 02:10.046
Okay.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.215
Good on ya.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.594
Very mature, Nina.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.096
Super adult.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.056
For a second there,
I thought you were gonna--

02:20.140 --> 02:21.391
Uh!

02:22.350 --> 02:24.769
Do that.
That... that's what I expected.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.158
Lemon water instead of beer.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.994
What brought this on?

02:41.077 --> 02:42.829
Don't get all smug.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.206
It's just my regularly scheduled
liver cleanse.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.334
Okay.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.794
It's on my iCal.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.130
-No.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.260
On the phone,
you said you had a revelation.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.808
You first, I guess.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.020
Yeah.

03:08.187 --> 03:11.858
I didn't take this project just so
you could see me all cleaned up.

03:11.941 --> 03:14.569
And I didn't really call you
all those times

03:14.652 --> 03:17.113
just to brag about my latest chip.

03:17.196 --> 03:18.406
Okay, well, maybe a little.

03:20.491 --> 03:23.202
But mostly, um, I came here...

03:24.203 --> 03:26.956
...because I wanted to make sure
that all those things

03:27.040 --> 03:29.292
I was doing back then didn't...

03:29.375 --> 03:30.460
Ruin me?

03:32.128 --> 03:33.671
Yeah, something like that.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.425
And if you were hurting,

03:39.177 --> 03:42.639
I wanted to do anything and everything
I could to make it better.

03:45.516 --> 03:46.476
What's wrong?

03:49.312 --> 03:50.897
Well, Emma's back.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.399
And she's pregnant.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.653
And... we're together again,

03:57.362 --> 03:58.404
the three of us.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.782
-Ex-wife.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.784
-Mm-hmm.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.454
And... and Jack's the father?

04:06.537 --> 04:07.538
Yeah.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.666
She's keeping it.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.881
So what does that make you?

04:17.882 --> 04:20.677
We were together... when it happened.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.472
So the baby is ours, not just theirs.

04:24.555 --> 04:25.807
Jesus, Isabelle.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.434
-Please just listen to me.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.188
It is only a matter of time
before those two

04:32.272 --> 04:34.482
gravitate back to the world
that they know,

04:35.108 --> 04:36.693
to the way things were.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.196
How long are you gonna live their life
instead of your own?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.906
Are those boots?

04:43.116 --> 04:44.158
What?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.286
Are those...

04:47.078 --> 04:48.204
...boots?

04:49.497 --> 04:50.415
Yeah.

04:50.498 --> 04:53.960
Yeah, these are the boots that I didn't
get you for your 17th birthday.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.671
Only, um, a lot better.

05:00.717 --> 05:01.551
What?

05:06.222 --> 05:08.141
-Wow.
-Goddammit, Izzy.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.435
How many times am I gonna have
to run after you?

05:10.518 --> 05:12.520
-I'm just trying to--

05:12.812 --> 05:14.105
Is that what you think I need?

05:14.188 --> 05:15.606
What did I do?

05:15.690 --> 05:18.192
You didn't miss
my 17th birthday, Ben.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.902
What are you talking about?

05:19.986 --> 05:21.154
Oh, God.

05:22.530 --> 05:26.034
You were drunk already when we met
for lunch at a skank ass bar.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.162
You'd been AWOL for about,
I don't know, a month.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.622
You looked so sick,
it scared the hell out of me.

05:32.498 --> 05:33.583
You bought me boots.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.960
Wrong ones, wrong size.

05:36.502 --> 05:39.088
Downed about four double vodkas
in 20 minutes

05:39.172 --> 05:41.090
and then promptly dropped off
the edge of the earth

05:41.174 --> 05:43.176
until about this time last year.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.929
Maybe my life isn't what you expected

05:47.180 --> 05:49.682
'cause it sure as hell
is not what I expected.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.559
But I'm not broken.

05:52.602 --> 05:53.811
Not like you were.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.564
So if you came here to save me,

05:57.106 --> 05:58.524
you shouldn't have fucking come at all.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.343
Here it comes. Yes.
-Aw.

06:25.426 --> 06:28.721
What am I looking at here?
Is this, uh... UFO footage?

06:28.805 --> 06:29.847
Come on.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.808
-Aw...
-I'm kidding!

06:32.308 --> 06:33.476
You guys did good.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.145
Guys, congratulations.
Are you kidding me?

06:36.229 --> 06:37.772
You've been through it
three different times but...

06:38.022 --> 06:40.316
Hey!
I forget.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.400
Hey.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.361
Hey. How long have you been there?

06:43.444 --> 06:46.531
Sorry, I just had a really
weird meeting with my dad,

06:46.614 --> 06:50.076
so I'm just still a little, like, ah.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.496
She had a meeting with her dad?

06:53.579 --> 06:56.290
-We can talk about it later.
-Just sit down. I'll get you a glass.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.918
-Okay.
-Iz, this wasn't a planned thing.

06:59.001 --> 07:01.963
No, we were downtown
and hadn't seen the sonogram yet.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.005
Huh?

07:03.089 --> 07:05.466
Should I be mad? I caught you
guys having wine and cheese,

07:05.550 --> 07:08.052
-not an orgy.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.597
-I'm... I'm good.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.266
-Okay.
-Okay.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.018
Mm-hmm.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.857
Kind of looks like a gnocchi.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.733
Six weeks.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.861
-It's pretty accurate.
-Yeah.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.950
Hey, so Izzy, will you be
joining us as we celebrate

07:31.033 --> 07:33.578
our hard

07:34.078 --> 07:35.788
What?

07:35.872 --> 07:38.458
Isn't... isn't that the 4th of July?

07:38.541 --> 07:40.751
Did you guys move it
when I wasn't looking?

07:40.835 --> 07:42.628
-Ah.
-No, this is when Hawthorne Heights

07:42.712 --> 07:47.008
was incorporated, when we escaped
the brutal tyranny of Raleigh Hills.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.302
-Yes, my liege.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.304
See, Izzy? We still day drink

07:51.387 --> 07:54.015
even after selling our souls
for better schools and lower crime.

07:54.098 --> 07:56.517
Yes, we just make up
ludicrous holidays as an excuse.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.686
-Love you, babe.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.689
-You have to come.
-Mm.

08:04.108 --> 08:07.487
Unfortunately,
I have a shift at Directions.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.571
Oh.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.866
And then probably a...
Feels like a...

08:11.949 --> 08:14.076
...bad cold?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.078
You don't have to come.
It's okay.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.372
-I know it's not your thing.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.792
Did you say something?

08:21.876 --> 08:25.588
Uh-oh. It means the cold's
barreling through.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.927
Hey, you know, for future reference,
if you really wanna sell it,

08:31.010 --> 08:33.846
you gotta... you gotta almost,
like, abrade your esophagus.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.015
-Yeah. Uh-huh.

08:36.098 --> 08:37.433
That, I buy.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.786
You have a Master's degree?
Excellent.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.663
That's actually something
we insist upon for our nanny.

08:58.746 --> 09:02.375
Our toddler and pre-toddler
crave elevated discourse.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.628
I will bring my A game.
Maybe we'll start a book club.

09:08.297 --> 09:10.216
Wow. Great crowd.

09:10.299 --> 09:13.386
You know, if you hire me,
I'm literally here all week.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.888
-Oh. We have seen a lot of clunkers.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.640
Yeah, it's pretty grim out there, right?

09:17.723 --> 09:18.724
Hear it all the time.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.060
So French Lit.

09:21.143 --> 09:24.063
The employment possibilities
are infinite.

09:24.146 --> 09:26.065
My parents were thrilled.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.526
-I like to think I do.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.030
So obviously, you speak--

09:33.114 --> 09:34.490
<i>Français? Oui.</i>

09:34.574 --> 09:37.702
<i>Je parle couramment et j'aimerais</i>
<i>aider vos enfants à apprendre.</i>

09:37.785 --> 09:39.120
I don't know what you just said,

09:39.203 --> 09:41.622
but your very existence makes me wish
we had 11 more kids.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.750
I said, yes,
I am fluent.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.003
And I would be thrilled
to teach your children,

09:47.086 --> 09:49.505
-if you're okay with that.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.550
I'm only semi-fluent, though,
in Spanish. Sorry.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.552
-That is so disappointing.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.389
You're either a slaver or a cannibal.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.141
Does it have to be just one?

10:00.224 --> 10:03.686
Okay. This is officially one of
the three best days of my life.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.731
Honey, we have two kids. Are you saying
this is better than our wedding day?

10:06.814 --> 10:09.942
You got shitfaced, grinded on
my great-aunt, when she was 80, so yes.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.320
One of the three best days
of her life, I'll tell you that right now!

10:13.529 --> 10:16.157
She's laughing at my jokes, honey.
See that? She laughs at my jokes.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.992
I heard that, sweetie, yes.

10:18.075 --> 10:21.162
Anyway, on to the tawdry details,

10:21.245 --> 10:23.581
my rate is $40 an hour,

10:23.664 --> 10:25.458
minimum five hours per day,
five days per week.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.043
Time and a half after 6.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.465
Hello

10:33.841 --> 10:35.593
Guess we know why you don't teach.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.846
I tell you what, why don't you write ads

10:38.929 --> 10:41.557
for skin tag cream and I'll do your job?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.768
Better pay, shorter commute.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.272
It's funny 'cause it's true.

10:49.565 --> 10:50.858
Au revoir.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.580
Okay, so what about the law student?

11:04.664 --> 11:05.665
Um...

11:06.290 --> 11:08.793
Josh or Jake.

11:09.085 --> 11:12.213
The kid that showed up drunk
and eye fucked you the entire time?

11:12.296 --> 11:13.339
Yeah, yeah, that...

11:14.090 --> 11:15.299
that one.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.726
We can start looking at daycares.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.319
Thank you.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.157
Mm.

11:40.741 --> 11:41.909
Hey.

11:49.917 --> 11:52.086
-It's almost 9.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.630
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Come back to bed.

11:54.713 --> 11:57.091
Everybody knows breakfast
doesn't start till noon.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.927
We're going to Trough. It's, like,
<i>the</i> place in Hawthorne Heights.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.720
We used to eat there
every Sunday.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.390
Oh, if it's called Trough,
how can it not be super cool?

12:04.473 --> 12:06.767
It is. The wait
staff looks down on everybody

12:06.851 --> 12:10.146
like they can just barely tolerate you.
It's awesome.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.399
Well, there's, um, there's
an open thesis workshop at 10.

12:13.482 --> 12:14.817
I should go, too.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.653
Four pages of the menu are
devoted just to pancakes.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.071
-Mm.
-Four.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.197
It's hard to resist.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.742
Four.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.371
Damnit.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.374
What?
-I'm intrigued.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.586
-Oh, she's coming.
-Nice.

12:42.761 --> 12:44.305
Morning.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.977
You look like shit,
and I mean that literally.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.187
Uh-huh.

12:52.229 --> 12:54.523
You know, it started
with this chick that I'm in love with,

12:54.607 --> 12:55.983
gut-punched me.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.611
Then there was a lot of, uh...

12:59.987 --> 13:01.614
...I wanna say rum.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.992
I'm pretty sure the pirate part
was a dream, though.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.871
Yeah, woke up...
woke up here roughly 10 seconds ago.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.790
That's, uh, that's a great story.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.585
Bye-bye.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.795
Nin, Nin. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Please.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.631
I appreciate it, okay? Thank you.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.425
-Showing up so I can double you over.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.928
The terror in your eyes
before you caught your breath

13:24.011 --> 13:26.347
was so fulfilling.
-Well, it's not exactly--

13:26.430 --> 13:29.350
Look, I have a thesis workshop,
like, one minute ago.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.852
So this is where we part ways forever,
okay? I'm gonna wish you the best,
while secretly hoping

13:34.438 --> 13:37.233
that you stumble off a curb
into the path of a speeding bus.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.359
Wait.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.737
I'm depressed.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.156
Yeah, a speeding bus
should clear that right up.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.452
I stopped the meds, like, four years ago,

13:49.662 --> 13:53.832
which is around the time that
the serial monogamy thing started.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.545
You know, tap into the romance rush

13:57.628 --> 14:00.005
and then cut and run
as soon as it wears off.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.217
Where did you go?

14:05.678 --> 14:06.845
Salem.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.848
My parents' house.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.063
Fine. Outside Dennis Hall in an hour.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.733
-Thank you.
-And for fuck's sake, take a shower.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.110
Will do.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.575
I'm gonna sit back...

14:28.242 --> 14:29.952
I'm gonna sit back down for a minute.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.291
Did we step back in time or what?

14:35.374 --> 14:37.626
Mm. It's exactly how
I remember it.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.422
Uh, two, three years?

14:41.505 --> 14:44.133
Oh, wow. It's like
I'm bathing in history.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.138
Hey, there she is.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.181
You're back. Awesome.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.685
This place is lit today.

14:54.768 --> 14:55.936
Am I right?

14:56.020 --> 14:58.439
-Off the hizook.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.649
No, it's just...

15:00.733 --> 15:02.818
These people next to us are, like,
super extra, too.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.278
I don't know if you've seen 'em.

15:04.862 --> 15:08.407
Hey, so can we not?
Because I'm super hungover.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.160
She's playing a role.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.120
Would you like to take our order?

15:13.203 --> 15:17.124
Am I standing by your table
with a pen and a notepad?

15:18.334 --> 15:20.544
-Well, fuck me, then.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.882
Oh, you're so good at that.
I will have the uzhe.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.761
Stands for the "usual."

15:29.136 --> 15:31.263
We will both have the chocolate chip
blueberry pancakes

15:31.347 --> 15:33.098
-and a side of bacon. Thank you.
-That's right.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.975
And I will have the same.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.226
Yeah...

15:36.310 --> 15:38.854
We have such a good thing going on,
she and I. We have

15:38.938 --> 15:41.315
this dry banter back and forth.
I don't know if you guys noticed.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.483
-Yeah.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.693
I'm sure she sees it
the same way, too, babe.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.363
Hey, I'm really glad you came.

15:47.655 --> 15:48.948
I'm making an effort.

15:49.573 --> 15:52.576
And also, I'm gonna come by
Hawthorne Day.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.162
I'm bringing Nina for moral support,
but I'll be there.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.498
-Oh, cool.
-All right.

15:57.581 --> 15:58.582
All right.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.087
Right. I don't know why
I expected otherwise.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.214
What are you talking about?

16:05.297 --> 16:08.509
Mm. Just the first time the three of us
have been out together here.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.219
No, that... that's not true.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.763
Yep, just look at anybody,
anybody in this room.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.850
You know this wouldn't
happen downtown.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.230
We can take a vote now.
I vote for downtown.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.898
I'm gonna say something.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.317
No, we should say it together,
you know? Like a solidarity thing.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.569
No, you guys, please.
Do not... do not do that.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.571
I'm with unicorn here.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.198
Don't make it weird.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.075
Thank you.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.456
She is awesome.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.793
Yeah, she's... on fleek.

16:42.876 --> 16:43.961
Oh, God.

16:44.044 --> 16:47.631
Did you go on Urban Dictionary
before we got here? Because I, like...

16:48.424 --> 16:49.717
Do you even know what that is?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.552
Yeah, it's when if somebody
comes into a room.

16:51.635 --> 16:53.220
No.
-You give them like a salute.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.179
What?

17:00.436 --> 17:01.687
Hope you're happy.

17:01.770 --> 17:04.023
Your stupid abs broke my hand.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.025
Seriously?

17:06.859 --> 17:09.445
Probably not, but it hurts.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.990
-Hmm...
-I'm sorry.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.660
Why didn't you tell me?

17:17.870 --> 17:19.329
That I've been doing a lot of crunches?

17:19.413 --> 17:21.790
About your weird
self-treatment program.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.462
I... didn't figure it out
until I lost you.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.006
Okay,
you didn't lose me, Andrew.

17:29.089 --> 17:33.135
You choreographed a series of bullshit
arguments ramping to a breakup.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.012
Usual pattern?

17:35.512 --> 17:36.555
More or less, yeah.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.059
The difference is what happened after.

17:41.393 --> 17:44.688
I, uh, I got drunk.

17:47.483 --> 17:51.278
Did that sound more likely
to inspire sympathy in your head?

17:51.361 --> 17:52.696
For five days.

17:54.281 --> 17:57.743
Woke up in the hospital, and my parents
had to come and take me home.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.537
Then what?

18:00.621 --> 18:03.874
Got up one morning,
my pops already had my backpack filled.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.293
Meds included.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.548
Spent a couple weeks camping.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.801
Well, that explains
the weird woodsy selfies.

18:13.884 --> 18:14.927
Yeah.

18:18.472 --> 18:22.392
So... so wait, you're telling me
that... that women stopped

18:22.476 --> 18:25.521
working as your antidepressants
because...

18:25.604 --> 18:27.314
Because I fell in love for real.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.070
Fucking it up with you,
it ran me off the rails,

18:33.153 --> 18:35.531
over the cliff, and I, uh...

18:35.864 --> 18:38.117
So what? I take you back
or you off yourself?

18:38.992 --> 18:41.870
Really? You're gonna drop all your shit
on top of my shit?

18:41.954 --> 18:44.540
I just want you to know
what I said that night, I, um...

18:46.959 --> 18:48.418
It's not me, it's you?

18:48.502 --> 18:50.546
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with you.

18:53.340 --> 18:57.761
You are absolutely perfectly
Nina Martone.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.558
That's pretty fucking amazing.

19:06.770 --> 19:09.356
Uh, I am super late for work.

19:10.774 --> 19:13.986
And for the sake of my exit, let's just
both pretend I care about that.

19:16.572 --> 19:17.489
Okay.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.783
I'm gonna need a beat
to process this, okay?

19:21.368 --> 19:23.162
Yeah, definitely, definitely.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.459
Nice ass.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.378
-Too soon.
-Okay.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.393
Hey!

19:47.060 --> 19:48.604
How's that hand, Rocky?

19:48.687 --> 19:50.022
It's fine.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.692
It hurts. I, uh, I can't even make
a decent fist.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.695
Yeah, well, that's...
that's probably for the best.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.614
Here, let's see.

20:06.413 --> 20:07.706
You're being weird.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.209
How am I being weird?
I'm icing your hand.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.544
Say something.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.004
About what?

20:14.755 --> 20:17.758
About the fact that we were roughly
an inch from kissing again

20:17.841 --> 20:20.177
when Andy Cutler strolled back
into the movie.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.970
Oh, that.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.597
Yeah, I know, I totally blocked that out.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.308
I mean, that seems like
ages ago now, right?

20:27.851 --> 20:30.687
Well, apparently losing me
put him in a straitjacket.

20:32.856 --> 20:35.192
Does that make you feel better?

20:35.859 --> 20:37.069
A little.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.447
A lot.

20:40.822 --> 20:43.575
Is it just me or did he get smaller?

20:43.659 --> 20:45.702
Do you know? He looked anemic.
He looked ill.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.163
-I mean, he just curdled, I mean, he--

20:48.247 --> 20:51.583
Okay, okay, on a scale from one to ten,

20:51.667 --> 20:54.878
with the options being nine or ten,
how jealous are you right now?

20:54.962 --> 20:56.004
-Yeah.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.339
-Yeah.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.383
Of that little sad waif
you bitch beat yesterday?

20:59.466 --> 21:00.384
-Mm-hmm.
-Come on.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.135
You beat up a waif?

21:02.219 --> 21:04.012
Why? Actually, don't tell me.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.807
You can tell me on the way
to Hawthorne Heights. Hi, Shaun.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.809
Oh, shit. Sorry, Iz.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.894
-I-I can't go.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.688
I didn't have time
to formulate an excuse,

21:12.771 --> 21:14.648
but I just remember that I hate it there.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.317
You wanna go
to a super fun party?

21:17.401 --> 21:18.735
-I do.
-He doesn't.

21:18.819 --> 21:19.820
-He does.

21:19.903 --> 21:20.862
-Yes.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.698
You got this, right, bud?

21:27.160 --> 21:28.203
Fine.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.094
It was like a war movie.

21:44.177 --> 21:47.514
There was just explosions in the air
as far as the eye can see.

21:47.597 --> 21:49.433
We were taking heavy fire.
It was total chaos.

21:49.516 --> 21:51.727
People hiding behind trees
and shielding their children.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.062
In my memory, everything was
in slow motion.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.441
There was a kind of a dramatic soundtrack
playing in the background.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.651
And I dropped to my knees
like Willem Dafoe

21:59.735 --> 22:01.445
at the end of <i>Platoon</i>
with the silent scream.

22:01.528 --> 22:04.740
Yeah, but that actually happened.
I mean, you really did that.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.034
-Yep.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.495
And that, Hannah, is why we no longer
incorporate fireworks into Hawthorne Day.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.372
Fuck off...

22:12.456 --> 22:15.292
-I'm talking about Jack.
-Yeah, we get it, man. Thanks.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.669
Man, I'm feeling a little bit
on the outside looking in here. Oh, no, no, just... just laugh
when everybody else laughs.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.382
And then eventually
we'll all assume you were here.

22:22.466 --> 22:25.469
No, it must be intimidating with all this
history, but you'll find your place.

22:25.552 --> 22:29.014
Or not. No, you will.
I mean time will tell.

22:29.097 --> 22:32.059
Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, yeah.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.686
I mean, it's kind of like
leaving a paper trail

22:34.770 --> 22:36.521
on your way north
and burning all your numbers,

22:36.605 --> 22:39.024
and then just trying to drop back in
like it never happened.

22:39.107 --> 22:41.777
No, but like you said,
time will tell so...

22:42.569 --> 22:44.780
Uh, is this over me?

22:44.863 --> 22:47.532
Like a friendship triangle?

22:47.616 --> 22:49.618
-Because I will milk the shit out of it.
-Okay.

22:50.368 --> 22:51.995
I miss this.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.749
I miss... this place.
I miss you guys.

22:55.832 --> 22:58.293
I miss... pretty much all of it.

22:58.376 --> 23:02.380
You know, your unabashed sincerity is
kind of making me uncomfortable.

23:02.672 --> 23:05.675
Not as uncomfortable
as that Castro beard is making me.

23:05.759 --> 23:09.054
Castro beard? There's my guy.
How long have you had that in the hopper?

23:09.137 --> 23:10.680
-Tip of the hat.
-Tip of the... Just...

23:10.764 --> 23:12.682
-Sorry I got the bigger hat, too.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.392
It's okay.
I got the bigger penis.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.603
Hey, the Wilbergs are putting
their place up on the market.

23:16.686 --> 23:20.315
So if you ever decide that a third-story
loft with no elevator is not

23:20.398 --> 23:21.817
the ideal way to raise a child...

23:21.900 --> 23:24.402
I bet I could get you guys in
for an advanced screening.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.321
Hey, speaking of screening,
you know,

23:26.404 --> 23:27.697
we could probably finally figure out

23:27.781 --> 23:29.783
if the legends are true
and they really have

23:29.866 --> 23:32.786
a 4K stereo surround-sound
Dolby digital-theater system

23:32.869 --> 23:34.538
in their basement! My God!

23:34.621 --> 23:36.581
Wow. Do you guys need
some alone time or...

23:36.665 --> 23:38.917
-It's fine.
-Just really love technology.

23:39.000 --> 23:39.960
Oh, I get excited.

23:40.043 --> 23:42.337
So what do you say, Trakarskys,
do you wanna check it out?

23:42.420 --> 23:44.631
Izzy said she'd rather sleep
under a bridge.

23:44.714 --> 23:47.384
I don't think a home theater
system's gonna sway her.

23:47.467 --> 23:51.054
I mean, we can check it out, right?
What's the harm in that?

24:17.789 --> 24:19.374
You look lost...

24:20.792 --> 24:22.294
Are you looking for the party?

24:23.503 --> 24:25.463
I'm looking for my girlfriend.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.509
Or maybe my ex-girlfriend.
I'm not really sure anymore.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.470
Kylie.

24:36.349 --> 24:37.767
Izzy.

24:37.851 --> 24:40.896
God, I love that house.
What's not to love?

24:40.979 --> 24:42.689
I'd move there.

24:46.860 --> 24:49.196
Well, fuck.
