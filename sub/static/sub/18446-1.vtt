Why is that, toad boy?

01:31.224 --> 01:35.183
Because we wouldn't have.
This place is dangerous.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.253
There's a legend.
Four hundred years ago,

01:38.331 --> 01:41.164
a ship stopped near here
and left behind a treasure.

01:41.234 --> 01:45.796
Must be a big treasure for someone
to go to the end of the Earth to hide it.

01:45.872 --> 01:50.275
And for some gringo to go
just as far to dig it up. Huh?

01:53.680 --> 01:56.706
You're a smart boy, Miguel.
[Flies Buzzing]

01:56.783 --> 02:00.378

I'm gonna let you have

you say that.
Oh, I will.

a little of you too.

- "Movies"?
- Is the only thing
that keeps her in line.

06:48.741 --> 06:53.474
The blood inside gives
whoever possesses the key
total power over Lilith.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.946
It doesn't matter
where the key is.

I-I know. It-lt doesn't sound
like all that much,

07:37.857 --> 07:41.156
but ill do
great business foreign.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.695
And the cassette...
Believe me.

07:43.763 --> 07:48.393
You know the last picture
that I directed made a fortune.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.904
I don't need to tell you
what a piece of shit that was.

07:51.971 --> 07:56.203

When I was still acting
in motion pictures,
[Sighs]

08:14.427 --> 08:16.452
I couldn't get him
to call me back.

08:16.529 --> 08:19.589
Not a single
goddamn phone call!

08:19.665 --> 08:23.431
Now, of course,
he'd give his left nut
to work with me.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.995
[Thinking]
And I'd give my left nut
for this lunch to be over.

08:27.073 --> 08:31.942
Which brings me to why
I've asked you here today.

08:32.010 --> 08:35.538

08:40.986 --> 08:43.784
Just as well
you feel that way...

08:43.856 --> 08:48.054

is big enough for the both of us.

08:48.728 --> 08:51.196
[Chuckling]

08:51.264 --> 08:53.232
Which is why
I would like...

to propose
a friendly little competition.

08:57.069 --> 08:59.731

[Chuckling]
I hope you boys
are ready to have fun.

15:41.273 --> 15:44.902
Just the thought
of all that naked flesh
waiting foryou.

15:44.977 --> 15:48.606
I'd join you myself,
but somebody has
to watch the door.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.945

You're outta your mind,
old man.
Yeah.

We were gonna take you up,
but, uh, thanks,
we've changed our minds.

Changed your minds?
[Clicking Tongue]

16:25.918 --> 16:29.854

the only way out.
Come along, boys.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.362
Deputy,
you don't understand.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.422
My brother's been gone
for days.
Ma'am, I understand just fine.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.435
Right now,
I'm up to my eyeballs
in missing persons.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.437
I'll get
to your brother...

21:13.505 --> 21:16.269
after I've gotten
to all these cases first.

21:16.341 --> 21:18.332
I'm sorry.
That could
take forever.

21:18.410 --> 21:21.709
- Ma'am, I'm sorry.
- Fucking cops are unbelievable.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.876
- Great.
- Now thas just ridiculous.

21:25.951 --> 21:29.148
A pretty lady like you
being treated like that.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.917
Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help
overhearing.

21:31.990 --> 21:35.824
My name is,
uh, Rafe Guttman,
Guttman Investigations.

21:35.894 --> 21:38.226
I specialize
in missing persons.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.231
Can I get that back?

21:40.299 --> 21:42.290
I'm savin' trees.
Just doin' my part.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.767
I have an office.
Maybe you and I
could go talk...

21:44.836 --> 21:46.770
Watch what
you're doing, huh?
Rafe Guttman.

21:46.838 --> 21:48.772
We could talk about this.
Unless you want
to stay here...

21:48.840 --> 21:52.469
and let the A-Team get
to your brother's case.

21:52.544 --> 21:55.274
I've had a few run-ins
with the cops myself, Miss...

21:55.347 --> 21:57.872
I didn't catch your name.
Verdoux, Katherine.

21:57.949 --> 22:00.110
Look, Mr. Guttman...
Call me Katherine.

22:00.185 --> 22:02.983
I'm not sure that I'm ready
to hire someone right now.

22:03.055 --> 22:06.354
What are you waiting for?
Every minute you delay,
is harder to find your brother.

22:06.425 --> 22:08.552
You gotta trust me.
I'm an expert.

22:08.627 --> 22:10.561
Well, I guess
it couldn't hurt to talk.

22:10.629 --> 22:13.359
Of course it wouldn't.
And I'll be gentle.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.195
And, you know,
I can't believe it,

22:15.267 --> 22:17.497
but I'm actually
going to ask a woman this:

22:17.569 --> 22:20.402
Uh, haven't I met you
somewhere before?

22:20.472 --> 22:23.737
Must be my imagination.

22:23.809 --> 22:25.902
Well, anyway, we're here.

22:25.977 --> 22:29.344
And I know you're already
feeling a little bit better
about me, aren't you?

22:29.414 --> 22:32.008
[Chuckling]

22:32.084 --> 22:36.020
Why don't you plunk it down
right over there?

22:36.088 --> 22:38.215
So tell me
about your brother.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.656
We had a fight.
He went out,
and he never came back.

22:40.726 --> 22:43.627
[Chuckling]
Thas one hell of a tiff.

22:43.695 --> 22:47.859
That sort of stuff
happen all the time?
We argue a lot.

22:47.933 --> 22:52.131
Then he goes out,
gets drunk with his friends,
and usually he comes home.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.229
Yeah, not this time.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.934
I'll tell ya what,
I'm gonna need the names
of those friends.

22:57.008 --> 22:59.340
I'm gonna need some phone numbers,
some addresses.

22:59.411 --> 23:02.812
Maybe a photo, charcoal rendering.
You got anything like that?

23:02.881 --> 23:06.681
Yeah, I did bring
a picture with me.

23:14.559 --> 23:19.656
- What are you lookin' at?
- [Laughs] Uh, your clutch.
I'm a purse freak.

23:19.731 --> 23:23.758
I'm looking at you.
I swear to God I know you.
We've never met?

23:23.835 --> 23:27.202
I don't think so.

23:27.272 --> 23:31.265
Well, you know something, dearie,
if is any consolation to you,

23:31.343 --> 23:33.277
you're just not my type.

23:33.345 --> 23:35.506
That is comforting.
Believe me.

23:35.580 --> 23:40.950
Can I get you something?
Maybe a cookie, popcorn,
a little Prozac, dear?

23:41.019 --> 23:42.680
I'm fine.

23:42.754 --> 23:45.848
So this is your brother.
Jesus Christ.

23:45.924 --> 23:49.690
Wow. Same parents?
[Laughing]

23:49.761 --> 23:52.286
- Can I keep this?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

23:52.364 --> 23:54.025
I might have to wear this
in a locket.

23:54.099 --> 23:58.001
How much is this gonna cost me?
A hundred and fifty a day,
plus expenses.

23:58.069 --> 24:00.833
Now I know
I made a mistake.
No, come on.

24:00.906 --> 24:02.806
Don't club me
with the dramatics.

24:02.874 --> 24:07.277
I've got a half-price sale
this week on missing brothers.
How's that?

24:07.345 --> 24:09.813

24:17.889 --> 24:21.325
For Chriss sake,
what do you want now?

24:21.393 --> 24:26.057
You're reminding me why
being married to you drove me
to the brink ofhomosexuality.

24:26.131 --> 24:29.567
I'm not hiding out on you.
Business has been dreck.

24:29.634 --> 24:32.967

24:45.884 --> 24:48.717
I don't want paid for my time.
I want paid for helping you.

24:48.787 --> 24:52.746

25:24.823 --> 25:27.553
Yeah.
Listen, uh, you're Zeke,

25:27.626 --> 25:30.857
I'm Zeke.
Zeke, I'm looking
foryour friend, Caleb.

25:30.929 --> 25:35.059
You seen him?
I don't know anyone
named Caleb, Rafe.

25:35.133 --> 25:38.796
You don't know shot selection either.
You really gonna do that?

25:38.870 --> 25:41.930
You really thinking of that?
You're gonna pot the cue ball, man.

25:42.007 --> 25:46.444
Why don't you go to hell.
Why don't I get out of the way
of the shrapnel.

25:49.681 --> 25:52.206
Goddamn it!
[Rafe]
What did I tell ya?

25:52.284 --> 25:54.184
Whas happening, Tonto?

25:54.252 --> 25:56.550
[Laughing]
[Zeke]
Your shot.

25:56.621 --> 26:00.079
Are you still here, man?
I'm still here,
and that cue ball's still potted.

26:00.158 --> 26:03.457
I see you boys both
have a nose thing.
[Laughing]

26:03.528 --> 26:05.758
Maybe you watch
a little too much QVC, huh?

26:05.830 --> 26:08.094
Thas quick.
Fuck you.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.464
[Laughing]
Consider me fucked.

26:12.904 --> 26:18.501
Whas next on the shit shot
agenda here forZeke?
You cannot be serious.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.602
Really, you should think about
putting the three in the...
[Zeke] Look.

26:20.679 --> 26:23.773
- I don't know where Caleb is, all right?
- Uh-huh.

26:23.848 --> 26:27.011
- Him and Reggie,
they went off to get laid.
- Long trip.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.076
Why don't you get the fuck
outta my face, tiger?

26:29.154 --> 26:32.954
I'm there foryou, Zekey.
What about you, Stephen Hawking?

26:33.024 --> 26:34.992
You seen Caleb?
You seen his girlfriend?

26:35.060 --> 26:37.722
[Chuckling]
He ain't got no girlfriend.
[Chuckling] No.

26:37.796 --> 26:42.199
They went to a whorehouse.
Oh, you like whorehouses,
don't ya?

26:42.267 --> 26:45.498
At this point in your life,

##

56:20.410 --> 56:22.708
You're so right,
Vincent.

56:22.779 --> 56:25.680
We should definitely expand
into places like this.

56:25.749 --> 56:28.946
I want that one

Hi.

Excuse me, sir.

Can you please tell me
why you come here?

57:20.036 --> 57:22.834
This place
is unbelievable.
Hi, sweetie.

57:22.906 --> 57:25.272
You really get around,
don't you?

57:25.341 --> 57:29.277
You're into prostitution
and strip joints.
Mm-hmm.

[Lilith] I can't decide
what to do with you.

58:15.558 --> 58:19.688
Should I kill you
or let you live
and make you my dog?

what are you doing?

- How did you get in here?

59:21.858 --> 59:24.292
Katherine, I have something
I have to show you.

59:24.360 --> 59:26.954
You don't give up, do you?
Is like a sickness
with you or something.

59:27.030 --> 59:28.463
I went to the Mount Hope
Cemetery last night.

59:28.531 --> 59:32.023
The McCutcheon Mortuary held
an internment there yesterday.

59:32.101 --> 59:35.935
I took some photos.
These photos are the contents
of the coffin they interred.

59:36.005 --> 59:39.600
I think you're gonna
want to look at 'em.
Just take a look.

59:43.479 --> 59:46.448
Thas very nice.
You're worse than I thought.
You are really sick.

59:46.516 --> 59:48.984
There were two bodies
in that coffin
when I took the pictures.

59:49.052 --> 59:52.021
Two bodies.
Get your fuckin' hands off me.
Sure.

59:52.088 --> 59:54.750
At least come to the cemetery,
for Chriss sake! Take a look!

[Sighs]
Sorry, Jonas.
[Security, Rafe Arguing]

59:57.527 --> 01:00:02.055
Excuse me, sir.
Can you please tell me
why you come here?

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:10.172
There was a woman
at that table, wasn't there?

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:13.868
[Katherine On Tape]
You're into prostitution...
I wasn't talking to myself.

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:17.310

I know there was somebody
at that table. Oh, my God.

Look, there'sJ.C.
[Rafe] Where?

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:22.980
I don't see him.
Right there.

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:24.986
Well, I'll be damned.

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:27.818
There he is
with the demented Ewok,
Professor Loveless.

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.324
You know, Katie Scarlett,
never...

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:34.159
trust any man of God
with a boner.

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:37.461
I mean an erection.
Sorry.
No, boner's the right word.

01:00:37.533 --> 01:00:39.660
Wow.
What is he doing there?

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:43.035
It doesn't make any sense.
Les get our facts
in order.

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:48.635
We have Reverend Current
leaving a topless bar.
Thas an odd one.

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:53.739
And we have photos
and videotape with people
who didn't photograph or record.

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:55.750
Follow that thread
of thinking.

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:59.686
Did not photograph.
Did not record.
I don't want you to flee.

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:02.122
I'm gonna advance a weird,
Duchovnyan riff.

01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:04.591
What if what we're
dealing with here...

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:08.654
is, in fact... vampires?

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:11.791
Are you crazy?
Why is that crazy?

01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:13.859
Because I advance the theory
that the perpetrator
of our crimes...

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:17.235
is an eternal spirit who
sustains itself solely...

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:19.137
through the intake ofhuman
hemoglobin through a set
of protracted fangs?

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:22.541
Shut up, Rafe.

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:26.844
Although... you have been right
about a lot of other things.

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:28.850
Wow.

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:31.113
Were you being nice
to me there, Katherine?

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:35.453
No. I just said you have been right
about a lot of other things.
Okay.

Is he breathing?

Now, don't you start
with that bullshit.

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:28.696
She was at the factory.
McCutcheon had her.

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:31.494
And that guy who worked
for Current was there.
And her brother.

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:33.694

I gotta play by the rules here.

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:09.230
I know how you feel.
I didn't want to be a vampire either.

Besides, you know me.
I've always been a night owl.

doesn't hurt either, does it?

do you want?
I'm here to see Lilith.

I know I can't fight you all,
so I've come to join you.

I'll be sure to tell her.
- No.
