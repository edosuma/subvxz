00:13.547 --> 00:16.117
Chances are you haven't
been to this place.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.689
Chances are this is a
place you've never seen,

00:24.925 --> 00:28.061
other than maybe blurry
cell phone videos,

00:28.062 --> 00:31.365
old black-and-white newsreels
from World War II.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.800
Chances are bad things were

00:33.801 --> 00:38.738
happening in the
footage you saw.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.641
Myanmar: after 50
years of nightmare,

00:41.642 --> 00:44.244
something unexpected
is happening here.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.779
And it's pretty incredible.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.793
In Yangon, capital city
of Myanmar, it's dark.

01:33.794 --> 01:37.631
Blackouts are frequent with
the ancient power grid.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.303
What sources of light there are

01:43.304 --> 01:47.740
in the street cast an
eerie, yellow/orange hue.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.310
For almost 100 years
under British rule,

01:50.311 --> 01:51.978
this was Rangoon.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.680
In 1948, after helping the

01:53.681 --> 01:55.682
British fight off the Japanese,

01:55.683 --> 01:57.650
and with a new taste for
self-determination, the

01:57.651 --> 02:00.188
country gained independence.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.826
After a decade of
instability, however,

02:06.827 --> 02:11.231
the military consolidated
power and never let go.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.332
Elections?

02:12.333 --> 02:13.833
They came and went.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.569
The results ignored,
opposition punished

02:16.570 --> 02:19.372
or silenced entirely.

02:19.373 --> 02:22.209
Burma, now Myanmar, where
Orwell had once served

02:22.210 --> 02:25.178
as a colonial policeman,
where he'd first grown to

02:25.179 --> 02:26.546
despise the apparatus of a

02:26.547 --> 02:28.348
security state, became more

02:28.349 --> 02:32.084
Orwellian than even he
could have imagined,

02:32.085 --> 02:34.587
a nation where even
having an opinion

02:34.588 --> 02:36.190
could be dangerous.

02:42.730 --> 02:46.599
I am very honored to be here at

02:46.600 --> 02:49.636
this university and to
be the first President

02:49.637 --> 02:51.271
of the United States of America

02:51.272 --> 02:52.705
to visit your country.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.541
Morning in Yangon.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.443
To nearly everyone's surprise,

02:56.444 --> 02:59.045
there have been some huge
changes in recent months.

02:59.046 --> 02:59.980
The most difficult time

02:59.981 --> 03:01.714
in any transition is when we

03:01.715 --> 03:04.584
think that success is in sight.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.886
Nobel Prize-winning
democracy champion

03:06.887 --> 03:10.056
Aung San Suu Kyi, for
nearly 15 years under house

03:10.057 --> 03:13.393
arrest, was released, and
has now taken an active

03:13.394 --> 03:15.028
role in politics.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.565
Just as the door is opening,

03:18.566 --> 03:19.732
my crew and I are among

03:19.733 --> 03:21.067
the first to record what has

03:21.068 --> 03:25.004
been unseen for decades
by most of the world.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.306
Meanwhile, this Southeast Asian

03:26.307 --> 03:28.641
country of 80 million people

03:28.642 --> 03:31.177
is collectively
holding its breath,

03:31.178 --> 03:33.413
waiting to see what's next.

03:33.414 --> 03:37.217
And will this loosening
of government grip last?

03:44.091 --> 03:45.958
Of course, morning in Yangon

03:45.959 --> 03:48.729
has always been about tea.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.171
It's black, Indian-style tea,

03:59.172 --> 04:00.673
usually with a thick dollop

04:00.674 --> 04:03.444
of sweetened condensed milk.

04:05.012 --> 04:09.382
You want it sweet, less
sweet, very sweet, strong,

04:09.383 --> 04:10.318
less strong?

04:10.319 --> 04:11.784
Everybody's got a preference;

04:11.785 --> 04:14.487
everybody's got a
preferred tea shop

04:14.488 --> 04:17.656
where they know, presumably,
how you like yours.

04:17.658 --> 04:21.127
I said I'm only less
sweet, and a bit strong.

04:21.128 --> 04:23.796
Journalist and
publisher U Thiha Saw.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.198
We meet at the Say
Thai Cha Tea Shop.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.301
Anything could happen
in a tea shop.

04:28.302 --> 04:29.336
This place mean, uh, a lot

04:29.337 --> 04:31.304
of things, not just a place for

04:31.305 --> 04:33.341
breakfast and snacks.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.144
For 50 years of
paranoia and repression,

04:38.145 --> 04:41.180
tea houses were also the
main forum for guarded and

04:41.181 --> 04:44.551
not-so-guarded discussions
of the daily news,

04:44.552 --> 04:46.919
where you tried to piece
together the real stories

04:46.920 --> 04:48.821
behind the ludicrously chopped

04:48.822 --> 04:51.157
and censored newspapers.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.392
Carefully, of course, because

04:52.393 --> 04:54.026
informers and secret policese

04:54.027 --> 04:55.995
were also heavily represented

04:55.996 --> 04:59.366
in these hotbeds of
sedition and discontent.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.500
So, given your profession,

05:00.501 --> 05:01.601
how have you managed to stay out

05:01.602 --> 05:03.503
of prison all of these years?

05:03.504 --> 05:05.338
No. I was there.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.406
Oh, really?

05:06.407 --> 05:07.174
Two times.

05:07.174 --> 05:07.941
Two times.

05:07.942 --> 05:09.509
Once special Burma Police

05:09.510 --> 05:10.177
called me. "Hey U Thiha Saw,

05:10.178 --> 05:12.011
will you please come into office?
We need to talk."

05:12.012 --> 05:12.413
Right.

05:12.414 --> 05:17.083
So I went over there
and the total was...

05:17.084 --> 05:19.720
89 days in the prison.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.190
There was this very serious

05:24.191 --> 05:26.593
control that came with the first

05:26.594 --> 05:27.428
military government.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.228
Right.

05:28.229 --> 05:30.630
Press scrutiny and
registration debacle. So...

05:30.631 --> 05:32.599
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.866
We need to send in our copies

05:33.867 --> 05:35.902
to that office and then
take a look at everything.

05:35.903 --> 05:36.936
They would say, "Take this out.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.305
Take that out or black
this out," or just,

05:39.306 --> 05:40.707
"Take the whole story out."

05:40.708 --> 05:41.475
Magazines that would come

05:41.476 --> 05:43.776
into the country would
they cut out...

05:43.777 --> 05:45.712
Literally cut out
the-the pieces.

05:45.713 --> 05:46.746
Well, the people under this

05:46.747 --> 05:49.081
kind of tight censorship,
people become more,

05:49.082 --> 05:50.417
I think, creative.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.584
Take a look, careful reading,

05:51.585 --> 05:55.455
there may be something
between the lines, messages.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.590
Right. It was something
you were accused of, uh,

05:57.591 --> 05:59.893
sending these secret messages.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.567
In the back, a cauldron
of salty little fish

06:07.568 --> 06:10.136
bubble over hardwood coals.

06:10.137 --> 06:14.306
Fingers work mountains
of sweet bean,

06:14.307 --> 06:15.242
one of the fillings for

06:15.243 --> 06:18.244
the variety of pastries
that are stuffed, shaped,

06:18.245 --> 06:21.715
and put into an old stone oven.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.953
In another corner, the
heartening slap of

06:26.954 --> 06:29.489
fresh bread, pressed
against the clay wall

06:29.490 --> 06:31.190
of a tandoori.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.159
And, of course, eggs
bob and spit in the

06:33.160 --> 06:37.029
magical hell broth of
fish, spice, and herb.

06:37.030 --> 06:37.598
Mohinga?

06:37.599 --> 06:38.765
Uh, this I must have.

06:38.766 --> 06:39.766
Correct me if I'm wrong,

06:39.767 --> 06:41.834
if there's a national
dish, a fundamental,

06:41.835 --> 06:44.437
most beloved dish, would
it be... would it be this?

06:44.438 --> 06:46.372
Yeah, for example, take a
look at all this sweet

06:46.373 --> 06:46.774
stuff.

06:46.775 --> 06:48.107
This is Indian.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.842
These are Chinese, et cetera.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.512
But then mohinga
is a local thing.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.613
And it's popular not in the city

06:53.614 --> 06:54.781
but also in the rural areas,

06:54.782 --> 06:58.718
too, in a fish base with
some rice or noodles.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.454
We would sometimes we
put in some crispies,

07:01.455 --> 07:04.156
like fried beans or...
fried guts.

07:04.157 --> 07:04.825
Mm.

07:04.826 --> 07:06.292
So, these are some
coriander leaves.

07:06.293 --> 07:06.994
Yeah.

07:06.995 --> 07:08.127
You can mix some-some limes.

07:08.128 --> 07:12.265
Sprinkle some in here.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.701
Mm. Good textures.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.136
Particularly in the light of,

07:17.137 --> 07:18.671
uh, Obama's recent visit,

07:18.672 --> 07:21.373
these are interesting times.

07:21.374 --> 07:22.642
Significant changes for the

07:22.643 --> 07:24.711
first time in, you
know, 50 years.

07:24.712 --> 07:25.646
Yeah.

07:25.647 --> 07:27.580
There's one thing which
is quite significant.

07:27.581 --> 07:28.215
For example, take a look around.

07:28.216 --> 07:30.850
All kinds of people,
all age groups.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.151
But a couple of years ago,

07:32.152 --> 07:33.586
people would be... when you're

07:33.587 --> 07:37.389
talking about politics,
you... you tone down.

07:37.390 --> 07:37.658
Right.

07:37.659 --> 07:38.991
I mean, you would be whispering.

07:38.992 --> 07:39.760
But nowadays, people just being

07:39.761 --> 07:41.994
more... are being, uh, outspoken.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.196
So, this has all
become much more open.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.364
In last July, they're sort of

07:45.365 --> 07:47.534
relaxing the rules
about censorship.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.001
August 20th, we were called

07:49.002 --> 07:50.069
into the Unintel office,

07:50.070 --> 07:52.271
we being publishers, editors.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.506
And the director general of

07:53.507 --> 07:55.074
the department said, the boss,

07:55.075 --> 07:58.911
"Okay, 48 years and 20 days
of censorship is gone.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.179
That's it."

08:00.180 --> 08:02.615
Feel good?

08:02.616 --> 08:04.016
Yeah. That's what we've been

08:04.017 --> 08:05.417
waiting for so many years.

08:05.418 --> 08:06.353
I love the-the-the answer.

08:06.354 --> 08:08.521
It's a careful yes.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.356
Yeah. First, people within

08:10.357 --> 08:12.792
the country, we have
some doubt about,

08:12.793 --> 08:15.595
"Okay, is it real, the
changes and the reforms?"

08:15.596 --> 08:17.463
But, as now it's about a couple

08:17.464 --> 08:20.232
of years, and then now
people start believing that,

08:20.233 --> 08:21.901
"Oh, maybe, maybe it's real."

08:21.902 --> 08:24.036
The process is still very young.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.572
It is still possible when the

08:25.573 --> 08:26.906
generals stop and think, "Okay,

08:26.907 --> 08:27.940
that's enough is enough.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.041
Let's turn back all our stuff

08:29.042 --> 08:31.711
"I'm optimistic about the
changes and the reforms.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.514
But I'm still
cautiously optimistic.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.222
In Yangon, motorbikes
are outlawed.

08:43.222 --> 08:46.058
Why is a matter of much
rumor and speculation.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.361
So, it's the bus for me.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.702
Something seems
almost out of sync.

09:00.574 --> 09:03.643
Not too long ago, even
filming here officially

09:03.644 --> 09:06.245
as an open, professional
Western film crew

09:06.246 --> 09:08.148
would have been unthinkable.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.785
In 2007, a Japanese journalist

09:12.786 --> 09:14.453
was shot point-blank and killed

09:14.454 --> 09:17.089
filming a street demonstration.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.424
Be seen talking to anybody with

09:18.425 --> 09:19.592
a camera and there would likely

09:19.593 --> 09:22.596
be a knock on your door in
the middle of the night.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.098
Yet so far, confronted
with our cameras,

09:26.099 --> 09:30.002
a few smiles, and mostly
indifference at worst,

09:30.003 --> 09:32.171
shocking considering how
recently the government

09:32.172 --> 09:34.574
has started to relax its grip.

09:38.846 --> 09:39.946
We love to eat.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.948
And don't forget, for 50
years, we were under two

09:41.949 --> 09:44.116
dictatorships, and
especially under some

09:44.117 --> 09:46.886
socialists, you have not
a lot of things to do.

09:46.887 --> 09:50.489
But, you know, cook and
share food and... you know.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.659
This is Ma Thengi, a famous

09:52.660 --> 09:56.663
and very controversial
figure in public life.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.564
Myanmar or Burma?

09:58.565 --> 09:59.799
Myanmar, because that's

09:59.800 --> 10:04.503
original name since
the, uh, 13th century.

10:04.504 --> 10:06.572
Ma Thengi, like U Thiha Saw,

10:06.573 --> 10:08.741
has also spent time in prison.

10:08.742 --> 10:09.976
But on emerging after three

10:09.977 --> 10:11.477
years, she became in the minds

10:11.478 --> 10:14.881
of many an apologist
for the regime.

10:14.882 --> 10:18.084
Fairly or not, I
leave to others.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.219
Sometimes, outsiders, um, act

10:20.220 --> 10:22.321
as if, you know, it's only after

10:22.322 --> 10:23.923
the military junta went away

10:23.924 --> 10:25.892
that, you know, things happened.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.159
First we were sort of, like, in

10:27.160 --> 10:30.162
a fro... frozen state,
like Snow White.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.898
Dead.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.500
But her many well-known
books on the culinary

10:34.501 --> 10:36.202
traditions of Myanmar

10:36.203 --> 10:39.872
make her a compelling
advocate for Burmese cuisine.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.174
So you're very passionate
about the cooking

10:42.175 --> 10:43.509
and the cuisine here, and...

10:43.510 --> 10:44.844
Well, it's just that I like

10:44.845 --> 10:46.680
to eat and I eat like a pig.

10:48.515 --> 10:51.484
This is Yangon's
field restaurant.

10:53.220 --> 10:56.188
Salads, I think, are
the... the best of our food.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.456
I'm going to order a lot of

10:57.457 --> 10:58.758
salads that you haven't had.

10:58.759 --> 10:59.792
You know, it's going to be like

10:59.793 --> 11:01.060
a sort of a tasting thing.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.796
There's pic head salad
with kaffir lime leaf,

11:03.797 --> 11:06.766
long bean salad with
sesame and fish sauce,

11:06.767 --> 11:09.301
penny leaf salad,
even this salad of

11:09.302 --> 11:10.903
India-style samosa.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.004
Everything's out there
at the same time.

11:12.005 --> 11:12.639
Yes.

11:12.640 --> 11:13.973
No first course, second course.

11:13.974 --> 11:14.641
No, no, no, no.

11:14.642 --> 11:16.308
If I'm invited to a friend's

11:16.309 --> 11:18.778
house, the table would
be covered with dishes.

11:18.779 --> 11:19.212
Right.

11:19.212 --> 11:19.646
Covered.

11:19.647 --> 11:20.880
And it's really about the

11:20.881 --> 11:23.716
interaction between a lot
of colors, textures,

11:23.717 --> 11:24.284
and flavors in one dish.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.252
Yes. Yeah.

11:25.253 --> 11:26.786
Or... Different.

11:26.787 --> 11:27.654
Different.

11:27.655 --> 11:28.721
Yeah.

11:28.722 --> 11:29.389
Wow, I'm in love.

11:29.389 --> 11:29.723
That's good.

11:29.724 --> 11:32.725
Yes. It is.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.761
And of course there's
the maddeningly

11:34.762 --> 11:37.129
delicious condiments and
pickles with which to make

11:37.130 --> 11:38.731
each dish your own.

11:38.732 --> 11:41.000
You make a lot of different
combinations with each

11:41.001 --> 11:41.802
mouthful.

11:41.803 --> 11:43.235
Ah. And this is something

11:43.236 --> 11:44.570
very confusing in general in

11:44.571 --> 11:45.905
this part of the world.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.740
Everybody eats everything
differently, to-

11:47.741 --> 11:49.075
to very much to their taste.

11:49.076 --> 11:49.910
Anything goes.

11:49.910 --> 11:50.577
Anything goes.

11:50.578 --> 11:51.744
You make-every mouthful you

11:51.745 --> 11:54.414
can make as different
as you want.

12:11.264 --> 12:14.935
Credit cards accepted
almost nowhere.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.937
Cash machines, uh-uh.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.638
Wi-Fi? Internet?

12:19.639 --> 12:20.807
Rare.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.775
3G? You got to be kidding.

12:22.776 --> 12:25.277
If you need to exchange
money here, only crisp,

12:25.278 --> 12:28.714
absolutely new $100
bills accepted.

12:28.715 --> 12:32.419
In Myanmar, it's
another, older world.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.130
Oh, and what's up with this?

12:44.131 --> 12:47.499
With all the, uh, kissing
sounds, that smooching,

12:47.500 --> 12:48.335
kissing, you know,
sound that you're

12:48.336 --> 12:50.136
hearing all over the place?

12:50.137 --> 12:52.872
My wife would have been in,
like, 10 fights so far.

12:52.873 --> 12:56.008
Sorry? Who... who are
you smooching at?

12:56.009 --> 12:57.243
Bitch?

12:57.244 --> 12:59.345
This is how you summon a waiter

12:59.346 --> 13:01.480
in Myanmar. I know. I know.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.849
Try that at Hooters and you

13:02.850 --> 13:04.650
will be rightly ejected.

13:04.651 --> 13:07.020
It takes some getting
used to, for sure.

13:08.055 --> 13:11.023
Min lane is a big, noisy
seafood house where fish

13:11.024 --> 13:13.525
is prepared in the
style of Rhakine,

13:13.526 --> 13:14.726
the coastal province to the

13:14.727 --> 13:19.098
west named for the Rhakine
people, one of over 135

13:19.099 --> 13:21.367
distinct ethnic
groups around here.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.870
See, now we're talking Prawn
curry is one of those-

13:23.871 --> 13:24.737
one of those things everybody

13:24.738 --> 13:26.372
tells you you got to eat here.

13:26.373 --> 13:30.109
Prawns from the river,
in tomato curry.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.778
I tell you this, good sauce.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.113
Oh, that's good.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.348
That is some good
shit, my friends.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.920
We shall know them by the
number of their dead.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.727
Early morning in Yangon.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.262
Among the crush of commuters,

13:50.263 --> 13:54.533
shoppers, people trying
to make a living,

13:54.534 --> 13:57.870
rise up the last remnants
of empire, faded,

13:57.871 --> 13:59.906
often crumbling, but still there

13:59.907 --> 14:01.740
after all these years.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.943
These are the
offices, businesses,

14:03.944 --> 14:07.447
and public buildings of
the British colonials.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.324
The Sofaer building was once

14:18.325 --> 14:22.295
one of the swankest
department stores in Rangoon.

14:25.899 --> 14:26.999
A century ago, when Kipling's

14:27.000 --> 14:28.800
poem "Mandalay" was beckoning

14:28.801 --> 14:30.436
the overheated imaginations of

14:30.437 --> 14:31.570
a generation of young

14:31.571 --> 14:33.339
Englishmen, here you could buy

14:33.340 --> 14:36.943
fine Egyptian cigarettes,
French liqueurs.

14:36.944 --> 14:40.779
The floor tiles were shipped
over from Manchester.

14:40.780 --> 14:43.282
Now, people live here.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.750
A half-century as a pariah

14:44.751 --> 14:46.085
state has left very few of

14:46.086 --> 14:48.587
these buildings in good repair.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.089
And there are divergent views

14:50.090 --> 14:51.690
on whether to preserve them.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.961
For many, a reminder of
colonial subjugation.

14:54.962 --> 14:58.831
For others, a vestige
of a golden time.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.141
These days in Myanmar in the

15:08.142 --> 15:10.709
streets, on the docks, it's all

15:10.710 --> 15:12.211
about moving forward.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.845
In an economy ripe to explode

15:13.846 --> 15:15.381
if things continue trending in

15:15.382 --> 15:16.782
their current direction,

15:16.783 --> 15:18.050
the busy hustle and bustle of

15:18.051 --> 15:20.286
Yangon's port appears even

15:20.287 --> 15:22.021
busier today as workers prepare

15:22.022 --> 15:24.291
for the oncoming holiday.

15:28.028 --> 15:31.230
Hey, Chef. How are you doing?

15:31.231 --> 15:33.465
It firgures, doesn't it?

15:33.466 --> 15:34.700
Yeah, it does.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.135
Welcome to Myanmar.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.804
Philippe Lajaunie,
owner/proprietor of my old

15:38.805 --> 15:40.406
restaurant, Les Halles.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.641
It seems only natural that, uh,

15:42.642 --> 15:45.477
you'd be in Burma, Myanmar,
at the same time as me.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.678
Back before anything, before I

15:46.679 --> 15:49.081
wrote the book that changed
my life from broke-ass

15:49.082 --> 15:52.318
utility-grade chef to
whatever it is I am today,

15:52.319 --> 15:53.819
I'd never been to Asia

15:53.820 --> 15:55.988
until this guy sent me to Japan

15:55.989 --> 15:58.358
and got me hooked
on a continent.

15:59.659 --> 16:00.327
But there we go.

16:00.328 --> 16:01.860
Oh, nice.

16:01.861 --> 16:02.894
Chicken head.

16:02.895 --> 16:03.663
Yeah.

16:03.664 --> 16:06.498
That is the perfect
mood awakener.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.499
Oh, yeah.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.335
Philippe travels constantly.

16:09.336 --> 16:12.038
He's been bouncing
around Asia for decades.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.405
Like all good travelers,

16:13.406 --> 16:15.174
he's relentlessly curious and

16:15.175 --> 16:17.176
without fear or prejudice.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.610
It's fantastic.

16:18.611 --> 16:19.878
It makes perfect sense, then,

16:19.879 --> 16:21.280
that over cold brew and chicken

16:21.281 --> 16:22.914
necks in the Port of Yangon,

16:22.915 --> 16:24.516
Philippe is the one joining me

16:24.517 --> 16:28.188
to explore this particular
moment in Myanmar.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.024
That's the money tree.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.593
Oh, it is going to be a party.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.329
Yeah.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.532
Full moon party tonight.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.900
Full moon party, that's right.

16:41.901 --> 16:43.135
Now, what that
means, we have no idea.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.203
We don't know.

16:44.204 --> 16:47.174
There is only one way
to find out, I suppose.

16:48.641 --> 16:56.641
♪ ♪

16:58.051 --> 16:59.718
Well, it sounds like a party.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.555
Oh, it gets crazy from now on.

17:04.491 --> 17:07.492
It's Dsong Dai, Full Moon Day,

17:07.493 --> 17:10.128
a holiday marking the end
of the rainy season.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.598
And today marks the
beginning of three days of

17:12.598 --> 17:14.067
Break Out the Crazy.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.502
Giant speakers compete for

17:17.503 --> 17:19.405
attention, everybody cheerfully

17:19.406 --> 17:21.907
oblivious to the distortion.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.978
Cotton candy, trinkets,
tube socks, just like

17:26.979 --> 17:29.248
a New York street fair,
but with infinitely

17:29.249 --> 17:30.883
better food.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.752
Oh, are these the little birds?

17:33.753 --> 17:36.955
Yeah. These guys
are really good.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.990
Was flying just a bit
earlier this morning.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.592
I'll tell you, it's the
backbone of every street

17:40.593 --> 17:42.961
fair in the world, isn't
it, deep-fried food?

17:42.962 --> 17:44.130
That's right.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.432
And here they also have
the-the little, uh, uh,

17:46.433 --> 17:49.801
batter, where they break
a quail egg in it.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.103
One shot.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.338
It's really good.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.939
That's it? He's happy?

17:53.940 --> 17:55.006
All right.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.275
This is so tasty.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.277
Much less greasy than I
thought it would be.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.778
In fact, rather delicate.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.713
Yeah, any time you tell
me "crispy little bird,"

18:01.714 --> 18:02.682
I'm all over it.

18:02.683 --> 18:04.983
Good head. Good beak, too.

18:04.984 --> 18:05.885
Good beak.

18:05.886 --> 18:07.953
Crispy and tender.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.422
Oh, and they have rides.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.023
Check this out.

18:12.024 --> 18:15.627
Okay, it's a Ferris wheel,
but the power source,

18:15.628 --> 18:18.797
not unusual for these
parts, is not electric.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.399
It ain't gas.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.370
Oh man, are you kidding me?

18:26.173 --> 18:29.074
It's human power.

18:29.075 --> 18:32.678
You have to see
it to believe it.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.514
An absolutely
insanely dangerous,

18:35.515 --> 18:37.149
closely choreographed process

18:37.150 --> 18:38.550
of first getting the giant,

18:38.551 --> 18:40.719
heavily-laden wheel in motion,

18:40.720 --> 18:42.388
and then getting it up to top

18:42.389 --> 18:45.892
speed and keeping it there.

18:49.028 --> 18:49.896
Wow.

18:49.897 --> 18:51.964
Look at this thing
tilting out, too.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.934
That's the break.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.937
Three guys the other way.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.072
Note the footwear, by the way.

19:01.073 --> 19:02.208
And it's not just this one.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.509
Every couple of blocks, bigger

19:03.510 --> 19:05.277
and bigger Ferris wheels,

19:05.278 --> 19:09.080
each one with its own troop
of acrobatic spinners.

19:09.081 --> 19:12.518
And sure, going for a
ride is tempting, but...

19:12.519 --> 19:15.454
"CNN host implicated in death of

19:15.455 --> 19:17.623
four underage carnies."

19:17.624 --> 19:19.725
That's the thing just
came off the hinges,

19:19.726 --> 19:20.527
and next thing you know

19:20.527 --> 19:21.361
it was rolling down the street

19:21.362 --> 19:22.728
and sending those kids flying.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.129
"If I'd had any idea, I never

19:24.130 --> 19:26.732
would have taken a
ride," says Bourdain.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.033
No, I don't think so.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.135
Hard making a buck. But again

19:30.136 --> 19:31.803
and again, the seats are loaded

19:31.804 --> 19:34.906
with smiling families,
the team climbs aboard,

19:34.907 --> 19:36.642
and the circus begins again.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.709
Good luck.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.545
May you return to earth safely,

19:39.546 --> 19:41.348
with all of your limbs intact.

19:58.465 --> 20:01.099
Next day in the
Full Moon Festival.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.167
And whether you're looking out

20:02.168 --> 20:05.104
the window at a rural village..

20:08.608 --> 20:10.476
Or at the streets of Yangon,

20:10.477 --> 20:13.945
what's happening is
probably pretty similar,

20:13.946 --> 20:16.582
a tableau of dancing,
body painting,

20:16.583 --> 20:18.751
car-mounted speakers blasting.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.661
But it's also three
days of merit accruing,

20:29.662 --> 20:30.829
the practice of performing

20:30.830 --> 20:32.264
charitable or otherwise good

20:32.265 --> 20:35.534
works in the hopes of
jacking up your karma.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.836
Money trees are paraded around

20:37.837 --> 20:40.506
pinned with cash
donations for monks.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.508
Free banquets and
feasts are held.

20:42.509 --> 20:46.245
And many moments of
spiritual reflection.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.682
The majority of people here

20:50.683 --> 20:53.552
practice Theravada
Buddhism, the oldest,

20:53.553 --> 20:54.820
most conservative form of the

20:54.821 --> 20:56.355
religion, which, simply put,

20:56.356 --> 20:57.856
asserts that existence isut,

20:57.857 --> 20:59.391
pretty much a continuous cycle

20:59.392 --> 21:03.796
of suffering through
birth, death, and rebirth.

21:09.336 --> 21:10.169
Noisy today.

21:10.170 --> 21:13.005
Very noisy, very noisy, yes.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.243
The Morning Star Tea
House, where I've come,

21:18.244 --> 21:19.978
well, for a couple of reasons.

21:19.979 --> 21:23.214
Reason one: the must-have,
bone-deep, old-school

21:23.215 --> 21:26.518
favorite around here, La
Pet Tok, the salad of

21:26.519 --> 21:28.720
fermented tea leaves. I know.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.689
That does not sound good.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.393
But you'd be wrong
to think that.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.429
Take the fermented tea leaves.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.197
Add cabbage, tomatoes,

21:39.198 --> 21:42.000
lots and lots of crunchy
bits like toasted peanuts,

21:42.001 --> 21:44.603
season with lime and fish sauce.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.271
This is absolutely delicious.

21:46.272 --> 21:47.073
You like it?

21:47.073 --> 21:47.907
Oh, yeah. It's fantastic.

21:47.908 --> 21:49.441
Yes, yes, fantastic.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.209
Simple, delicious.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.243
Things not to be taken for

21:52.244 --> 21:53.445
granted if you've been in and

21:53.446 --> 21:55.280
out of the joint like this guy,

21:55.281 --> 21:58.216
Zarni Bo, activist, astrologer,

21:58.217 --> 21:59.785
and three-times convict.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.252
Yeah, everyone I've met in this

22:01.253 --> 22:04.089
country so far, in fact,
has been to prison.

22:04.090 --> 22:04.457
It-it seems, uh.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.425
Yes, this happens again and

22:05.426 --> 22:06.792
again for us in Myanmar.

22:06.793 --> 22:07.893
For almost six-six years?

22:07.894 --> 22:08.960
Six years, nearly six years.

22:08.961 --> 22:09.762
About six years.

22:09.762 --> 22:10.597
All the judgments are

22:10.598 --> 22:12.030
made by the kangaroo court. The

22:12.031 --> 22:13.765
navy, army, and the air force,

22:13.766 --> 22:16.267
these three officials are
sitting all together.

22:16.268 --> 22:17.769
They read off, uh, "This is your

22:17.770 --> 22:18.770
sentence," like that.

22:18.771 --> 22:19.639
Right.

22:19.640 --> 22:20.772
It happens. Only minutes.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.574
Pst, like that.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.410
Uh, what is life
like inside prison?

22:24.411 --> 22:25.578
Nice, nice, very nice.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.580
I have a hard
time believing that.

22:28.581 --> 22:29.215
No. Very nice.

22:29.216 --> 22:31.216
We can talk to each other,

22:31.217 --> 22:32.283
you know, saying some things.

22:32.284 --> 22:33.652
And we use a mirror to look each

22:33.653 --> 22:34.820
other. It's very nice.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.254
Access to books?

22:36.255 --> 22:37.623
No book. No writing thing.

22:37.624 --> 22:38.890
No paper.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.659
No, nothing at all.

22:40.660 --> 22:45.464
A mat and a blanket and
a plate and a bowl.

22:45.465 --> 22:46.065
Right.

22:46.066 --> 22:48.133
Only these are the
things that we possess.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.801
How's the food,
the food in prison?

22:49.802 --> 22:52.671
Soup. Rice with pea soup,

22:52.672 --> 22:55.674
only one meat meal for a week.

22:55.675 --> 22:56.775
That's on Thursday.

22:56.776 --> 22:59.411
You know that in prison,
it ends in prison.

22:59.412 --> 23:01.312
All the fish has no body,

23:01.313 --> 23:03.314
only the head and the tail.

23:03.315 --> 23:06.151
No middle part.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.654
I can look like that.

23:08.655 --> 23:10.321
So, there is hope for this

23:10.322 --> 23:11.823
country in your view, yes?

23:11.824 --> 23:13.592
Yes, yes, especially with the

23:13.593 --> 23:15.827
Buddhist belief, you know,

23:15.828 --> 23:17.162
how to live in situations.

23:17.163 --> 23:18.697
Dictators, you know, and the

23:18.698 --> 23:20.766
political pressures, or even

23:20.767 --> 23:23.502
discrimination, everything
is happening to us.

23:23.503 --> 23:24.603
But the Buddhists say,

23:24.604 --> 23:27.005
"Okay, that's about
past life love.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.842
If we go do something, the
next life will be good."

23:33.780 --> 23:35.647
There's something
pretty cool about meeting

23:35.648 --> 23:39.184
people who've been, for
so long, unable to speak,

23:39.185 --> 23:40.686
now so unguarded about

23:40.687 --> 23:43.790
their hopes and their feelings.

23:46.459 --> 23:52.865
♪ ♪

24:06.178 --> 24:09.347
Sizzling meats, the
clink of beer glasses,

24:09.348 --> 24:11.149
ringing bicycle bells.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.852
This is Yangon's 19th Street.

24:13.853 --> 24:17.388
Does Yangon rock? Can it rock?

24:17.389 --> 24:21.392
19th Street is like a
must-go place when you are

24:21.393 --> 24:23.394
in Yangon.

24:23.395 --> 24:26.665
Meet Burmese punk
rockers Side Effect and

24:26.666 --> 24:28.667
lead singer Darko.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.570
Uh, you can come here anytime.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.705
It will be lots of
people, like here.

24:33.706 --> 24:34.873
So, if you sit here long

24:34.874 --> 24:37.242
enough, you'll see every
musician in town?

24:37.243 --> 24:40.045
Yeah, you could say that.

24:40.046 --> 24:41.713
The citywide
curfew used to mean,

24:41.714 --> 24:43.682
"Close your doors at 11 p.m."

24:43.683 --> 24:45.917
Most shops and restaurants
still close early,

24:45.918 --> 24:47.953
but not here on 19th Street,

24:47.954 --> 24:50.556
where you can eat barbecue
late into the night.

24:50.557 --> 24:51.723
Wow.

24:51.724 --> 24:52.424
What do we have here?

24:52.425 --> 24:53.525
What, uh, grilled tofu?

24:53.526 --> 24:54.126
Yeah.

24:54.127 --> 24:55.426
And this is a pork tail.

24:55.427 --> 24:56.427
Pork tail, oh.

24:56.428 --> 24:57.863
Yeah.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.931
This barbecue is awesome.

24:59.932 --> 25:02.267
These young men show exactly
how determined you've

25:02.268 --> 25:06.805
got to be to rock,
especially in Burma.

25:06.806 --> 25:10.942
I like to say my early
influence was Nirvana.

25:10.943 --> 25:14.079
And then, Sex Pistols, Ramones,

25:14.080 --> 25:16.047
and stuff like that.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.449
What American bands do you hate?

25:18.450 --> 25:22.287
Especially, uh, um, Creed.

25:22.288 --> 25:23.089
Yes.

25:23.089 --> 25:23.956
Yeah.

25:23.957 --> 25:27.959
They are, like, the
worst band in the history

25:27.960 --> 25:31.063
of, like, the world.

25:32.431 --> 25:36.467
So, what's it like having
an indie band in Myanmar?

25:36.468 --> 25:38.236
Is it a little difficult?

25:38.237 --> 25:39.738
For sure. For sure, yeah.

25:39.739 --> 25:42.340
Before you reconnaissance or,

25:42.341 --> 25:43.474
you know, like, when you got

25:43.475 --> 25:46.645
the lyrics, you got
to submit the lyrics.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.513
So they're going to censor it.

25:48.514 --> 25:49.815
They're going to check it.

25:49.816 --> 25:53.251
And even sometimes they-
they will, you know,

25:53.252 --> 25:56.087
suggest to you some
words to change.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.488
Oh, that must be funny.

25:57.489 --> 25:59.791
Very funny, actually, you know?

25:59.792 --> 26:01.760
Now, is that still the case?

26:01.761 --> 26:03.829
Now, it's not like that anymore.

26:03.830 --> 26:04.996
They're not going to censor you.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.665
But it's going to be kind of

26:06.666 --> 26:08.199
risky, because you don't know

26:08.200 --> 26:09.701
what's going to happen to you

26:09.702 --> 26:12.739
if you write and sing
something wrong.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.807
So, let me ask this:
if all your dreams

26:15.808 --> 26:18.810
came true, where would
you want to play?

26:18.811 --> 26:19.712
New York City.

26:19.713 --> 26:21.146
You want to go to New York City?

26:21.147 --> 26:23.782
Yeah. Oh, it's my dream.

26:23.783 --> 26:26.217
You just need to be
strong, so that's what...

26:26.218 --> 26:28.854
That's what I keep
telling my band mates,

26:28.855 --> 26:30.689
you know, "Come on, be strong.

26:30.690 --> 26:31.523
Have faith."

26:31.524 --> 26:33.892
So. So I hope people
reach out to you,

26:33.893 --> 26:36.027
because making rock 'n'
roll is hard enough.

26:36.028 --> 26:39.631
Truly independent rock
'n' roll is even harder.

26:39.632 --> 26:41.700
And I'm guessing that making it

26:41.701 --> 26:43.501
here is harder still.

26:43.502 --> 26:46.705
So, gentlemen, you
deserve some success.

26:46.706 --> 26:49.175
People should hear you.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.392
So, you heard the sleeping
car lost a wheel?

27:07.393 --> 27:08.194
The what?

27:08.194 --> 27:09.061
The sleeping car lost a

27:09.062 --> 27:11.096
wheel, uh, and the dining car.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.097
So, we get a new.

27:12.098 --> 27:13.699
Well, no, we lost the
dining car, I hear.

27:13.700 --> 27:14.733
We lost the dining car,

27:14.734 --> 27:17.068
but even our original
sleeping car lost a wheel.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.906
So, we just have to
hope for the best.

27:21.440 --> 27:25.343
The night express to Bagan,

27:25.344 --> 27:27.112
600 kilometers of what will

27:27.113 --> 27:31.116
turn out to be kidney-softening
travel by rail.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.918
But Bagan, Myanmar's ancient

27:32.919 --> 27:35.787
capital, I've been
told, is a must-see.

27:35.788 --> 27:38.289
The true old English experience.

27:38.290 --> 27:41.292
The engine is a French
engine from the '70s.

27:41.293 --> 27:44.095
We've been told it's a
somewhat uncomfortable

27:44.096 --> 27:46.698
10-hour trip.

27:46.699 --> 27:47.633
So really, the question on

27:47.634 --> 27:49.467
this end of the journey is:

27:49.468 --> 27:52.570
come back on the train
or flying coffin?

27:52.571 --> 27:55.540
Mishaps on both Burmese
planes and trains are not,

27:55.541 --> 27:58.643
shall we say, unheard of.

27:58.644 --> 28:00.211
The Widowmaker Express.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.114
That is the choice.

28:04.383 --> 28:05.951
So, that may be the signal to,

28:05.952 --> 28:07.152
uh, depart at some point.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.587
Yeah. All aboard?

28:16.662 --> 28:18.163
Whoa, we're moving.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.231
Here we go.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.633
Here we go.

28:25.504 --> 28:26.438
Oh, that's it.

28:26.439 --> 28:28.840
We have reached our
cruising, uh, speed.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.608
Really? This is
cruising speed, we think?

28:30.609 --> 28:31.977
Just a bit.

28:31.978 --> 28:33.745
You could literally
outrun this train.

28:33.746 --> 28:34.980
We could jog ahead,

28:34.981 --> 28:37.182
have a nice meal in some, uh,

28:37.183 --> 28:39.417
you know, recommended,
uh, restaurant.

28:39.418 --> 28:40.352
We could catch up with it.

28:40.353 --> 28:44.290
It's like the
digestive, uh, walk.

28:47.760 --> 28:48.694
There we go.

28:48.695 --> 28:52.064
This is stop number one of 75.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.385
Heading north, the
scenery opens up.

29:14.386 --> 29:16.721
The space between
things gets wider,

29:16.722 --> 29:20.526
more pastoral, and
more beautiful.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.233
Looking around at my
fellow passengers,

29:28.234 --> 29:29.634
it could be hard to distinguish

29:29.635 --> 29:32.070
between the 135-plus ethnic

29:32.071 --> 29:36.074
groups that make up the
Burmese population.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.342
The very name "Burma"

29:37.343 --> 29:42.347
refers actually to only
one of these groups.

29:42.348 --> 29:44.549
What they all seem to
have in common, however,

29:44.550 --> 29:47.518
is thanaka, a face paint
and sunblock made

29:47.519 --> 29:51.923
from tree bark that masks
many of their faces.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.324
It's ubiquitous here.

29:53.325 --> 29:54.926
At first jarring to see,

29:54.927 --> 29:56.394
it quickly becomes something

29:56.395 --> 29:59.731
you get used to and
take for granted.

30:17.884 --> 30:20.285
Yangon's gravitational
pull broken,

30:20.286 --> 30:21.552
and with darkness falling,

30:21.553 --> 30:23.189
the train picks up speed.

30:26.558 --> 30:29.361
At times, terrifyingly so.

30:33.765 --> 30:34.966
I mean, this thing is going

30:34.967 --> 30:37.569
to derail at some point.

30:39.538 --> 30:40.771
They have lost how many wheels

30:40.772 --> 30:43.808
yesterday on this one train?

30:43.809 --> 30:46.811
So, truly, it's about
being in the right car,

30:46.812 --> 30:49.314
the one that keeps its wheel.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.482
Derailments, or "rail slips,"

30:51.483 --> 30:52.817
as they are referred to here,

30:52.818 --> 30:54.319
a somewhat more benign-sounding

30:54.320 --> 30:56.654
occurrence than, say,
"Rolling off the tracks into

30:56.655 --> 30:57.989
a rice paddy,"

30:57.990 --> 31:00.126
are not uncommon.

31:04.096 --> 31:05.730
And one can't help wondering

31:05.731 --> 31:07.132
what the engineer and conductor

31:07.133 --> 31:08.633
are thinking as the trainductor

31:08.634 --> 31:13.139
speeds heedlessly on,
faster and faster.

31:13.805 --> 31:16.674
I mean, it must be, what,
about 40, 50 miles per

31:16.675 --> 31:17.909
hour at this point.

31:17.910 --> 31:18.677
I wonder if anyone has ever,

31:18.677 --> 31:19.578
like, flown right out of their

31:19.579 --> 31:21.279
seat, out the window.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.182
Yes, small people, sure.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.918
You don't want to be,
like, holding a lap dog.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.353
Or a baby, or anything.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.688
I mean, it's...
Try pissing in the

31:30.689 --> 31:33.358
bathroom and find yourself
launched straight up

31:33.359 --> 31:35.760
into the ceiling, bringing
to a rude conclusion

31:35.761 --> 31:40.566
what was already an
omnidirectional experience.

31:44.103 --> 31:45.203
It's smooth now.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.239
It's very relaxing.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.675
What kind of beer did he have?

31:50.676 --> 31:52.344
I want the same.

32:28.880 --> 32:29.648
Samosa?

32:29.648 --> 32:30.482
Yes.

32:30.483 --> 32:31.749
Yeah.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.718
1,000?

32:33.719 --> 32:35.320
Done.

32:35.321 --> 32:39.090
Now, this is breakfast.

32:39.091 --> 32:41.926
Nearly 19 hours
into our 10-hour trip,

32:41.927 --> 32:43.428
and the night express to Bagan

32:43.429 --> 32:45.696
lurches and bounces onward over

32:45.697 --> 32:49.434
old and poorly
maintained tracks.

32:49.435 --> 32:52.370
Could have flown back to
New York for breakfast.

32:52.371 --> 32:53.771
I-I had time.

32:53.772 --> 32:57.042
What's in yours? Carrots.

32:57.043 --> 32:59.677
Root. I got potatoes in mine.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.346
How to make good food pretty.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.380
Look at this.

33:02.381 --> 33:03.848
A bouquet of fish.

33:03.849 --> 33:05.884
Indeed.

33:11.457 --> 33:12.424
So, this is it.

33:12.425 --> 33:15.361
This is the Plain of Bagan.

33:20.266 --> 33:21.632
Out the window, the modern

33:21.633 --> 33:23.301
world seems to fade away, ern

33:23.302 --> 33:25.703
then disappear altogether,

33:25.704 --> 33:27.072
like the last century never

33:27.073 --> 33:31.410
happened, or even the
century before that.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.046
We're traveling across the

33:34.047 --> 33:39.117
largest mainland nation
in Southeast Asia.

33:39.118 --> 33:40.418
But it should be pointed out

33:40.419 --> 33:41.486
that we are still within the

33:41.487 --> 33:44.755
confines of the
tourist triangle,

33:44.756 --> 33:48.426
areas permissible for travel.

33:48.427 --> 33:51.162
Whole sectors of this
country, much of it, in fact,

33:51.163 --> 33:54.999
are off-limits. Simply put,

33:55.000 --> 33:59.804
there is shit going on they
do not want you to see.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.606
A low-intensity conflict with

34:01.607 --> 34:04.442
the ethnic Kachin tribe
would be one of them,

34:04.443 --> 34:09.580
a wave of persecution and
deaths in Rhakine state.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.982
The country may be opening
up at its center,

34:11.983 --> 34:13.518
but all along the edges it's

34:13.518 --> 34:15.520
waging a desperate war to hang

34:15.521 --> 34:18.156
on to the status quo.

34:18.157 --> 34:22.628
Needless to say, the
status quo is not good.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.034
All right.

34:31.036 --> 34:33.772
Bagan, here we come.

34:47.886 --> 34:50.221
1,000 years ago, Bagan
was the capital for a

34:50.222 --> 34:53.791
long line of Bama kings.

34:53.792 --> 34:54.958
It's the sort of place where

34:54.960 --> 34:59.230
the old coexists
with the even older.

34:59.231 --> 35:00.166
As elsewhere in this part of

35:00.167 --> 35:02.833
the world, in many of the
Buddhist temples here,

35:02.834 --> 35:05.203
far older animist spirit-based

35:05.204 --> 35:09.207
beliefs coexist with
more recent Buddhism.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.409
And, in Myanmar,
worship of the Nats

35:11.410 --> 35:13.344
is widespread.

35:13.345 --> 35:16.814
Nats, as I understand it,
are more like Greek gods,

35:16.815 --> 35:18.816
former humans, demigods,

35:18.817 --> 35:20.585
spirits, often with very human

35:20.586 --> 35:22.820
qualities and failings.

35:26.057 --> 35:27.425
Dance performances pay homage

35:27.426 --> 35:29.594
to the individual Nats,

35:29.595 --> 35:31.262
performers claiming to actually

35:31.263 --> 35:32.863
channel them, bringing about,

35:32.864 --> 35:37.736
one hopes, a beneficial
spiritual possession.

35:42.574 --> 35:45.743
But I'm not just
here for a Nat Pwey.

35:45.744 --> 35:46.944
I have a list:

35:46.945 --> 35:49.180
things to eat in Myanmar.

35:49.181 --> 35:50.881
And this is one of them.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.284
Chicken curry.

35:53.285 --> 35:55.286
And from roadside
joints like this,

35:55.287 --> 35:56.954
nestled among the temple ruins,

35:56.955 --> 35:57.889
you're more than likely touins,

35:57.890 --> 36:02.293
catch a very enticing whiff.

36:02.294 --> 36:03.594
Just delicious.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.463
Spicy, but not to the point
that you want to scream

36:05.464 --> 36:09.133
out for mercy, but some heat.

36:09.134 --> 36:10.134
Slow simmered curry,

36:10.135 --> 36:12.036
served with a side of sour soup

36:12.037 --> 36:14.372
made from roselle leaves.

36:14.373 --> 36:16.307
With it, you get
fried, ground chilies,

36:16.308 --> 36:19.109
pickled bean sprouts...
You get the idea.

36:19.110 --> 36:20.945
They always have,
like, these relishes,

36:20.946 --> 36:22.247
these dippy type things, these,

36:22.248 --> 36:24.549
like, really interesting
salads, and I'm, like,

36:24.550 --> 36:26.551
not really a salad guy.

36:26.552 --> 36:29.554
The salads here are,
uh... they're happening.

36:29.555 --> 36:32.457
Spicy, sour, salty,
savory, just delicious.

36:32.458 --> 36:33.225
It's delicious.

36:33.226 --> 36:35.826
A plethora of
textures and flavors.

36:35.827 --> 36:36.827
This is a culture that's

36:36.828 --> 36:38.095
thought a lot about their food,

36:38.096 --> 36:41.666
clearly like eating,
like feeding people.

36:41.667 --> 36:42.667
They think a lot about those

36:42.668 --> 36:48.673
classic balances of flavors,
colors, and textures.

36:48.674 --> 36:51.477
Best restaurant in the
country so far, by the way.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.501
You'd expect this, an ancient

37:16.502 --> 37:19.670
city of nearly unparalleled
size and beauty,

37:19.671 --> 37:21.372
to be overrun with tourists,

37:21.373 --> 37:25.343
souvenir shops, snack
bars, tours on tape...

37:25.344 --> 37:26.344
But no.

37:26.345 --> 37:29.448
Oh, this is stunning.

37:29.881 --> 37:31.649
You'll encounter some
Western travelers at

37:31.650 --> 37:33.318
Bagan's temple sites for sure,

37:33.319 --> 37:36.554
but, generally speaking,
they're a hardy bunch...

37:36.555 --> 37:37.888
Even the bus tours here are not

37:37.889 --> 37:41.627
for the faint of heart
or the weak of spirit.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.027
But for the most part,

37:43.028 --> 37:44.228
you're far more likely to bump

37:44.229 --> 37:47.031
into a goat than a foreigner.

37:47.032 --> 37:52.737
This is so beautiful, so
much like an ode to human,

37:52.738 --> 37:54.639
you know, beliefs and adoration

37:54.640 --> 37:58.075
and worshiping
and-and... Slave labor.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.477
And slave labor.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.679
I'm thinking, you build
this many temples,

38:01.680 --> 38:04.081
thousands of them, in
a relatively short

38:04.082 --> 38:04.883
period of time?

38:04.884 --> 38:05.884
You know, chances are somebody

38:05.885 --> 38:07.552
was working for less
than minimum wage,

38:07.553 --> 38:08.653
let's put it that way.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.254
For sure.

38:10.255 --> 38:13.658
Ah, we could fly here.

38:13.659 --> 38:14.892
Look at that.

38:14.893 --> 38:18.229
Whew.

38:23.402 --> 38:26.236
A millennia ago, in
a period of just under

38:26.237 --> 38:30.274
250 years, over 4,000
structures like this

38:30.275 --> 38:32.478
were built here.

38:33.712 --> 38:34.879
They say that a Bama king,

38:34.880 --> 38:37.882
Anorata, began this project
after a conversion to

38:37.883 --> 38:41.820
Theravada-style Buddhism.

38:43.088 --> 38:46.425
They started a new temple,
like, every 14 days.

38:48.627 --> 38:52.096
Over 3,000 pagodas,
temples, and monasteries

38:52.097 --> 38:53.631
remain today.

38:53.632 --> 38:57.067
Inside almost every one
of them, a Buddha figure,

38:57.068 --> 38:59.804
each one different.

38:59.805 --> 39:02.440
And I like how integrated
it is with those

39:02.441 --> 39:04.775
trees, ox trails, and...

39:04.776 --> 39:06.477
Actually, funny you
should mention that.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.813
People used to live here,
but the government came

39:08.814 --> 39:10.781
along in the '80s, I believe,

39:10.782 --> 39:13.283
and relocated... it was a
mass relocation project.

39:13.284 --> 39:13.952
Right.

39:13.953 --> 39:15.920
So, any homes, anything, it

39:15.921 --> 39:18.122
was understood that this
is a good... you know,

39:18.123 --> 39:19.289
there's some tourist bucks here.

39:19.290 --> 39:22.394
They relocated the
entire population.

39:26.965 --> 39:30.501
We're in one of the first
mass waves of tourists.

39:30.502 --> 39:31.769
European tourists have been

39:31.770 --> 39:33.103
coming here in relatively small

39:33.104 --> 39:34.072
numbers for a long time.

39:34.073 --> 39:36.106
But the floodgates
have certainly opened.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.141
They're building hotels like

39:37.142 --> 39:40.144
crazy around this area,
what's called the

39:40.145 --> 39:41.145
Tourist Triangle.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.647
I really like this, too.

39:42.648 --> 39:44.982
This is silk and cotton poly.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.984
And what-what is this here?
Oh, this-this is a...

39:46.985 --> 39:49.454
This is a nice cloth.

39:49.455 --> 39:50.488
As Myanmar begins

39:50.489 --> 39:52.156
its shift towards accommodating

39:52.157 --> 39:53.591
increasing tourism and a

39:53.592 --> 39:55.526
service economy to go with it,

39:55.527 --> 39:57.862
there will be adjustments.

39:57.863 --> 40:00.531
There will be, of
course, a downside.

40:00.532 --> 40:02.433
Now, how much you pay?

40:02.434 --> 40:03.168
Okay.

40:03.169 --> 40:05.369
What's that going to mean?
How will the Burmese

40:05.370 --> 40:07.638
react to all of the goods-good

40:07.639 --> 40:10.007
and evils that
come with tourism?

40:10.008 --> 40:10.842
Okay, Mister.

40:10.843 --> 40:12.677
What about... you pay one. Okay.

40:12.678 --> 40:13.445
Perfect. It's perfect, yeah.

40:13.445 --> 40:14.045
Excuse me.

40:14.046 --> 40:15.646
It's going to mean mobility.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.682
It's going to mean
prosperity for some.

40:17.683 --> 40:19.484
Will mean a lot of bad
things, too, you know.

40:19.485 --> 40:20.685
It'll mean prostitution;

40:20.686 --> 40:22.119
it'll mean hustling.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.153
Here you go. Okay, my booth

40:23.154 --> 40:24.154
Unintel fine restaurant.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.157
Okay. And you, too.

40:27.158 --> 40:27.993
Everybody is selling to you,

40:27.994 --> 40:30.828
you buy Unintel, you
pay 20, you buy...

40:30.829 --> 40:31.730
I know, I know.

40:31.731 --> 40:32.797
But you don't buy postcard.

40:32.798 --> 40:33.665
Now, that's no fair.

40:33.665 --> 40:34.566
You buy postcard, also fair.

40:34.567 --> 40:35.900
But I don't need the postcard.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.334
We're told that
kids are dropping out

40:37.335 --> 40:40.004
of school to do this, the
double-edged sword of

40:40.005 --> 40:41.371
the service economy.

40:41.372 --> 40:42.540
You want to buy postcard?

40:42.541 --> 40:43.974
For, uh, only $5.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.476
One, two, three, more, five,

40:45.477 --> 40:47.112
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.486
What I'm amazed is how
friendly and open people

40:55.487 --> 40:56.187
are with us.

40:56.188 --> 40:58.055
It's very easy for me to sit

40:58.056 --> 41:00.858
here and say whatever I
want about the government.

41:00.859 --> 41:01.493
Right?

41:01.494 --> 41:03.193
We can go home.

41:03.194 --> 41:04.162
You know.

41:04.163 --> 41:06.565
Our lives will go on.

41:08.333 --> 41:11.836
We don't pay the
price for that show.

41:11.837 --> 41:14.404
Uh, everybody who helped us

41:14.405 --> 41:16.841
could very well pay that price.

41:16.842 --> 41:17.875
It should be pointed out that a

41:17.876 --> 41:19.510
lot of people did not.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.278
A lot of people were very
nice to us but said,

41:21.279 --> 41:24.248
"Look, I just... I've
already been in jail."

41:24.249 --> 41:26.250
You know?" I don't... I
really don't want to

41:26.251 --> 41:27.417
go back."

41:27.418 --> 41:29.219
Um, it's a very real concern.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.188
What happens to the
people we leave behind?

41:31.189 --> 41:32.023
You know, one would think that

41:32.024 --> 41:34.592
you can't... once freedom...
You know, they've tasted

41:34.593 --> 41:35.293
freedom, you know?

41:35.294 --> 41:40.230
Well, uh, uh, you know, you
can put the toothpaste

41:40.231 --> 41:41.365
back in the tube.

41:41.366 --> 41:41.933
You know?

41:41.934 --> 41:44.603
Uh, there's no doubt about that.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.137
But for the moment at least,

41:47.138 --> 41:50.474
things seem to be moving
in the right direction.

41:50.475 --> 41:53.578
A country closed off
to most for so long,

41:53.579 --> 41:55.813
sleeping, a 50-year
nightmare for

41:55.814 --> 42:00.450
many of its citizens,
finally may be waking up.

42:00.451 --> 42:01.586
To what?

42:01.587 --> 42:03.521
Time will tell.
