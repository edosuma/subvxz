doing down here?                

00:59.026 --> 01:00.625
You ought                       
to be in bed.                   

01:00.627 --> 01:04.729
     I feel too bad to lie down.
    Did you call Dr. Nelson?    

01:04.730 --> 01:06.497
Yeah, but he can't come.

it sounds like

                tell him?       

01:19.579 --> 01:24.182

Well, what am I supposed to do? 
I got a cold and a fever.

Oh, well, maybe if you ate      
  a little for your fever now,  

01:50.977 --> 01:54.245
you could starve a little       
 for your cold in the morning.

                    is that?    

02:28.148 --> 02:30.782

Frank Lorenzo                   
was telling me                  

05:49.749 --> 05:53.284
how they grow them              
in a special fertilizer.        

05:53.286 --> 05:56.754
        Oh, jeez, can't you     
        be delicate? I'm eating.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.889
  Ma, didn't you see the article
         in today's paper?      

05:58.891 --> 06:00.691
         They recalled          
a whole batch of mushrooms      

06:00.693 --> 06:01.859
because of food poisoning.      

06:01.861 --> 06:03.027
                     [SCOFFS]   

06:03.029 --> 06:06.965
Oh, my! I hope I ain't          
poisoned you, Archie.           

06:06.967 --> 06:08.566
                Don't be stupid.

06:08.568 --> 06:11.302
If you'd poisoned me, I'd be    
  heaving up all over the table.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.937
Archie.                         

06:12.939 --> 06:14.572
        Ma, when did you        
      buy these mushrooms?      

06:14.574 --> 06:16.841
      Day before yesterday.     

06:16.843 --> 06:18.076
That was before the recall.     

06:18.078 --> 06:20.278
The cans you bought might be    
some of the bad ones.           

06:20.280 --> 06:22.746
Arch, I don't think you should  
  be eating any more of that    

06:22.748 --> 06:24.782
until we find out what kind     
  of mushrooms these are.       

06:24.784 --> 06:26.184
            Listen, wise guy,   
                  if you think  

06:26.186 --> 06:28.252
     you're gonna ruin my dinner
    with all this bad news,     

06:28.254 --> 06:30.121
        you're wrong, because   
        I'm already finished.   

06:30.123 --> 06:31.689
Arch, I'm just                  
telling you--                   

06:31.691 --> 06:33.691
                     [BELCHES]  

06:41.633 --> 06:44.435
    Would you bring me my coffee
      over to the coffee table? 

06:44.437 --> 06:45.769
            All right.          

06:45.771 --> 06:48.539
Arch, I think we ought to       
check out those mushrooms.      

06:48.541 --> 06:52.443
  And I think that you ought to 
 check out of this here country.

06:52.445 --> 06:53.511
What?                           

06:53.513 --> 06:54.712
                You're always   
                burnin' down    

06:54.714 --> 06:56.714
            everything that     
             America stands for.

06:56.716 --> 06:58.916
America stands                  
for mushrooms?                  

06:58.918 --> 07:00.018
                Get out of here.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.553
            You and your heroes 
          like that Ralph Nader,

07:02.555 --> 07:05.523
 you're giving the whole country
    a pain in the butt.         

07:05.525 --> 07:07.725
Arch, you ought to be grateful  
for Ralph Nader.                

07:07.727 --> 07:09.860
Do you realize                  
that before 1968                

07:09.862 --> 07:12.830
there were hardly any cars      
recalled for being defective,   

07:12.832 --> 07:16.901
but in 1972 there were          
nearly 8 million cars recalled. 

07:16.903 --> 07:20.638
              And do you realize
                that in 1974... 

07:20.640 --> 07:22.907
                      who cares?

07:22.909 --> 07:25.643
Nader cares, Arch.              
And you should too.             

07:25.645 --> 07:27.412
You drive a cab                 
part-time.                      

07:27.414 --> 07:29.747
Ralph Nader may                 
save your life someday.         

07:29.749 --> 07:33.051
          How? By making people 
         scared to ride with me?

07:33.053 --> 07:36.187
        The only person         
     that's deflective is Nader.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.222
              Nader ain't       
      doing the country no good.

07:38.224 --> 07:39.924
 Oh, oh, oh. I get it.          

07:39.926 --> 07:43.027
What's good for General Motors  
is good for the country.        

07:43.029 --> 07:44.595
    You're damn right.          

07:44.597 --> 07:46.830
  BOTH: And Ralph Nader ain't   
  no good for General Motors!   

07:46.832 --> 07:48.332
                         No!    

07:48.334 --> 07:51.069
Here you are, Archie.           

07:51.071 --> 07:53.571
        Are you feeling         
         anything yet?          

07:53.573 --> 07:54.805
                      What?     

07:54.807 --> 07:57.241
I mean, are the mushrooms       
        getting to you?         

07:57.243 --> 08:00.244
          What, are you helping?

08:00.246 --> 08:01.745
             No!                

08:01.747 --> 08:03.114
            I'm feeling fine.   

08:03.116 --> 08:05.249
        I don't want to hear    
nothing more about mushrooms.   

08:05.251 --> 08:06.917
        Oh, that's good.        

08:06.919 --> 08:08.252
Not necessarily, Ma.            

08:08.254 --> 08:09.554
If he's                         
got botulism,                   

08:09.556 --> 08:11.922
the symptoms might not          
show for hours.                 

08:11.924 --> 08:13.057
                  If I got what?

08:13.059 --> 08:14.592
        Botulism.               

08:14.594 --> 08:18.529
    Get out of here. Nobody ever
    went crazy eating mushrooms.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.801
Arch, "botulism" means          
"food poisoning,"               

08:23.803 --> 08:26.036
and I think we ought to         
check those mushrooms.          

08:26.038 --> 08:27.705
      Oh, I think so too.       

08:27.707 --> 08:29.073
                What do you know
                    about it?   

08:29.075 --> 08:31.476
        He's nuts. I'll give you
             a for instance.    

08:31.478 --> 08:33.311
              How many different
             brands of mushrooms

08:33.313 --> 08:35.011
            are sold all over   
              this here country?

08:35.014 --> 08:36.514
         Oh, thousands.         

08:36.515 --> 08:37.548
                      All right.

08:37.549 --> 08:39.484
            And how many cans   
        do you think are bought?

08:39.486 --> 08:40.784
        Millions.               

08:40.785 --> 08:42.553
          So what do you think  
            the chances are     

08:42.554 --> 08:44.255
             of me getting      
            the one bad can     

08:44.256 --> 08:46.056
            out of all them     
        millions of cans?       

08:46.058 --> 08:48.493
            What is it,         
                100 to 1?       

08:49.628 --> 08:52.029
  What is that, the new math?   

08:55.033 --> 08:58.068
I'm glad you're all right,      
            Archie.             

08:58.070 --> 08:59.670
             One of the troubles
              with this country 

08:59.672 --> 09:02.906
     is that some little thing  
goes wrong, everybody panics.   

09:02.908 --> 09:04.875
Oh, hi, honey.                  
Honey.                          

09:04.877 --> 09:06.944
I'm sorry. I was                
on my way up, really.           

09:06.946 --> 09:08.412
     Oh, that's all right,      
            Michael.            

09:08.414 --> 09:09.580
                 I understand.  

09:09.582 --> 09:11.215
                Out of sight,   
                    out of mind.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.651
Oh. Honey, don't be that way.   

09:13.653 --> 09:16.687
Ma, did you put any mushrooms   
        in your stew today?     

09:16.689 --> 09:18.022
    Yeah. Why?                  

09:18.024 --> 09:20.391
            Oh, no.             
     Did everybody eat it?      

09:20.393 --> 09:22.527
     No, just Archie.           

09:22.529 --> 09:23.961
Why are you asking?             

09:23.963 --> 09:25.729
        Well, because I was     
         listening to the radio,

09:25.731 --> 09:27.231
                    and the news
                    was just on,

09:27.233 --> 09:29.767
            and they said that  
          three people in Queens

09:29.769 --> 09:31.502
             are in the hospital
                with botulism   

09:31.504 --> 09:32.770
                  from eating   
            canned mushrooms.   

09:32.772 --> 09:34.038
        Huh?                    
      You hear that?            

09:34.040 --> 09:35.239
Archie!                         

09:35.241 --> 09:37.141
              GLORIA:           
You know what else they said?   

09:37.143 --> 09:39.043
    One person died from it.    

09:39.045 --> 09:40.244
                Somebody died   
                      from it.  

09:40.246 --> 09:42.480
    All right, there's your     
    one dead guy out of 100.    

09:42.482 --> 09:44.682
    I'm in the clear.           

09:47.052 --> 09:49.687
She said somebody died          
in Queens.                      

09:49.689 --> 09:51.689
     Ah, she didn't say         
     nothing like that.         

09:51.691 --> 09:52.956
     Yes, Daddy, in Queens.     

09:54.493 --> 09:55.726
      What part of Queens?      

09:55.728 --> 09:56.927
         What brand of mushrooms
                 was it?        

09:56.929 --> 09:57.961
     Will you shut up?          

09:57.963 --> 09:59.163
What part of Queens?            

09:59.165 --> 10:02.233
    I don't know. They said     
    it was Pocono mushrooms.    

10:02.235 --> 10:05.336
 Pocono. Well, all right, don't 
  start a panic now, will you?  

10:05.338 --> 10:08.406
Edith, what brand of mushrooms  
did you buy?                    

10:08.408 --> 10:09.540
            I can't remember.   

10:09.542 --> 10:11.342
Come on, come on, come on.      
Think, will you?                

10:11.344 --> 10:12.343
Was they the Poconos?           

10:12.345 --> 10:13.877
            Arch, take it easy. 
            Don't panic.        

10:13.879 --> 10:15.580
    Will you stay               
    out of this?                

10:15.582 --> 10:17.147
Now, take it easy.              
Don't panic.                    

10:17.149 --> 10:18.782
Just think. Think.              

10:18.784 --> 10:20.318
             Yeah, I'm thinking.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.920
 All I can remember is there was
 something funny about the name.

10:22.922 --> 10:24.121
      Pocono's a funny name.    

10:24.123 --> 10:26.390
What's funny about it?          

10:26.392 --> 10:28.892
          They had a pink label,

10:28.894 --> 10:31.995
         and they was a bargain:
        three for 59 cents.     

10:31.997 --> 10:33.531
            So I got three cans.

10:33.533 --> 10:37.901
Are you telling me that you put 
three cans of poison in my stew?

10:37.903 --> 10:40.304
    Why don't we check the cans 
and see what brand they were?   

10:40.306 --> 10:42.240
Why don't you                   
stay out of this?               

10:42.242 --> 10:45.142
Edith, we got to check the cans 
and see what brand they were.   

10:45.144 --> 10:46.644
What did you do                 
with the cans?                  

10:46.646 --> 10:48.178
                 I put them in  
            the garbage pail.   

10:48.180 --> 10:49.580
You put them in                 
the garbage pail?               

10:49.582 --> 10:52.583
Look in that garbage pail       
in there.                       

10:52.585 --> 10:54.385
Get out of the way here.        
Let me look--                   

10:54.387 --> 10:55.986
Get out of the way!             

10:55.988 --> 10:57.588
There ain't no garbage          
in the garbage pail!            

10:57.590 --> 10:59.523
Oh, no, I put them              
in the trash can.               

10:59.525 --> 11:01.158
Look in the trash can           
      outside.                  

11:01.160 --> 11:03.761
You're in the way, Edith. You're
 in the way. You're in the way.

You want me to lay on the floor?

Sorry. Sorry.                   
                Get out of here!

16:25.850 --> 16:27.517
                I hope you ain't

              Well, you've come 
             to the wrong place.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.356
     They won't even look at you
         unless you drop dead.

Are all these people            
    ahead of us?                

16:37.262 --> 16:38.395

16:38.397 --> 16:40.731
        Nobody's ahead of me!   

16:40.733 --> 16:44.401

Hey, hey, doc--                 

16:51.877 --> 16:54.478
Hey, doc, I got a poison pain   
knifing right through me here.  

16:54.480 --> 16:55.679
    What's the matter           
         with this man?         

16:55.681 --> 16:57.147
                 He says he ate 
            poison mushrooms.   

16:57.149 --> 16:58.181
Yeah.

17:06.758 --> 17:08.492
        Right, where's the pain?

Well, it's all over, doc,       

17:09.929 --> 17:11.328
but I think it starts           
around here--                   

17:11.329 --> 17:12.762
        These mushrooms you ate,

17:12.765 --> 17:14.364
         they weren't Poconos,  
    by any chance, were they?   

17:14.366 --> 17:15.766
            I got a bulletin    
                on them today.  

17:15.768 --> 17:17.367
Yeah, that was the kind         
I had, Poconos.                 

17:17.368 --> 17:18.367
         All right, don't panic.

Let me try and read something   
here. Yeah, it's blurred.

No, she never puts that in      
 the stew, only the mushrooms.

Oh, jeez,

17:47.700 --> 17:49.399
          Some people           
    are very allergic to it.    

17:49.401 --> 17:51.168
         Is that right?         
    What's it do to someone?

17:52.304 --> 17:53.871
         In some cases          
it could cause arthritis.

             Oh...

that can bowl with arthritis.

all you can be is dead, huh?

         Okay, let's go         
    for the arthritis.          

18:13.759 --> 18:17.828
        All right, just relax

 This anecdote you give, uh...

          how are you           
     supposed to take that?

 Here, you go get me the number 
  of that law firm that I had   

20:24.156 --> 20:25.689

             the whiplash there.

Oh, what was                    
their name?                     

20:27.592 --> 20:29.293
      Oh, jeez, I forget.       
    Now, let me think.          

20:29.295 --> 20:30.694
  There was three Jewish guys,  

20:30.696 --> 20:32.796
     all with the same name     
      in the same family--      

20:32.798 --> 20:34.164
          Jewish name.          

20:34.166 --> 20:35.799
Well, what do you               
want me to do?                  

20:35.801 --> 20:39.069
Look them up in the Yellow Pages
under "Jewish lawyers"?         

20:39.071 --> 20:41.604
 No, that would take too long.  

20:41.606 --> 20:43.841
    Go get the shoebox          

20:43.843 --> 20:46.676

    all that useless paper.     

20:46.678 --> 20:49.880
There's a letter in there       
     from that firm to me.      

20:49.882 --> 20:51.114
  I don't know, Arch.           

20:51.116 --> 20:53.217
         I don't think          
    you got much of a case.     

20:53.219 --> 20:56.019
Ah, what are you talking about? 
Look at my hurt arm there.      

20:56.021 --> 20:58.322
        Look at the way         
    my eyesight went blurry     

20:58.324 --> 21:00.991
    from the lastitude          
  they put in them mushrooms.   

21:02.626 --> 21:05.162
  Arch, you still can't prove   
 that you ate Pocono mushrooms. 

21:05.164 --> 21:08.098
    Ah-hah, buddy boy,          
nobody can prove that I didn't. 

21:08.100 --> 21:10.400

    the good old USA,

till he's proved healthy.

 Come on, get out of my chair.

 shape of it. Get out of there!

                        Arch,   

21:31.723 --> 21:32.722
        you still need evidence.

21:32.724 --> 21:34.291
  What are you talking about?   

21:34.293 --> 21:36.193
          Look at all           
they put me through, huh.       

21:36.195 --> 21:37.827
Look at the way I hurt all over.

21:37.829 --> 21:40.530
What about the sworn testiphony 
  of your mother-in-law there?  

21:40.532 --> 21:42.766
    That's evidence, buddy.     
         We got a case.         

21:42.768 --> 21:44.034
 And let me tell you something. 

21:44.036 --> 21:47.737
A case like that could be worth 
    20, 25, 50 grand.           

21:47.739 --> 21:49.273
         I'm gonna make         
      them mushroom people      

21:49.275 --> 21:50.908
        put their mouth         
     where their money is.      

21:50.910 --> 21:52.142
What do you mean by that?       

21:52.144 --> 21:53.743
     I mean that the bosses     
        of that company         

21:53.745 --> 21:55.145
         ought to taste         
     every mouthful of food     

21:55.147 --> 21:57.281
 before it leaves the factory.  

21:57.283 --> 21:59.349
  How are they gonna do that?   

21:59.351 --> 22:00.617
     What do you mean, how?     

22:00.619 --> 22:02.219
     Ain't you never heard      
    of the olden days,          

22:02.221 --> 22:03.486
     in the days of kings?      

22:03.488 --> 22:05.923
    The king used to have a     
special cook to taste the food. 

22:05.925 --> 22:09.092
 If the cook dropped down dead, 
    the king says, "Hey..."     

22:10.795 --> 22:12.396
    Then the king went back     
         to the kitchen         

22:12.398 --> 22:14.097
      and made a sandwich       
          for himself.          

22:15.233 --> 22:17.301
Daddy, I think I found it.      

22:17.303 --> 22:20.437
Is this them? Rabinowitz,       
Rabinowitz & Rabinowitz?        

22:20.439 --> 22:24.007
                 That's them,   
             the three wise men.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.242
                 Now, Meathead, 

22:25.244 --> 22:27.144
        you're gonna see some   
            swift legal action. 

22:27.146 --> 22:28.845
          Get them on the blower
            for me there.       

22:28.847 --> 22:30.080
At this time of night?          

22:30.082 --> 22:31.748
             Go on. They've got 
        an answering service.   

22:31.750 --> 22:32.983
                Get them on     
                the phone there.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.651
         You wait and see now.  

22:35.786 --> 22:36.853
                    [SNEEZES]   

22:36.855 --> 22:38.355
Ah, don't be spraying           
into the phone.                 

22:38.357 --> 22:41.691
What do you want to do?         
Give the three Jews the flu?    

22:41.693 --> 22:43.427
Give it to me, here.            

22:43.429 --> 22:47.864
         Archie, I got          
    the most wonderful news.    

22:47.866 --> 22:50.100
Save it, save it,               
I'm dialing a number here.      

22:50.102 --> 22:51.734
         At Ferguson's just now,

22:51.736 --> 22:55.105
I saw some of the same mushrooms
      you had for dinner,       

22:55.107 --> 22:56.573
            and I brought       
            some of them home.  

22:56.575 --> 22:57.774
Oh-ho-ho,                       
great work, Edith.              

22:57.776 --> 22:59.109
You hear that?                  

22:59.111 --> 23:01.111
Your mother-in-law just brought 
home the poisoned evidence.     

23:01.113 --> 23:03.180
        Wait. I thought         
    they were all recalled.     

23:03.182 --> 23:05.115
    Only the Poconos, Mike.     

23:05.117 --> 23:06.916
     That's the good news.      

23:06.918 --> 23:10.687
 The mushrooms you ate, Archie, 
      were Top Caps, see?       

23:10.689 --> 23:13.323
Hold on. Is this the service--? 
Hold on just a second. What?    

23:13.325 --> 23:16.259
  They got the same pink label  
        as the Poconos,         

23:16.261 --> 23:18.495
        but the yellow is just  
          a special sticker     

23:18.497 --> 23:20.864
         that says "3 for 59."  

23:20.866 --> 23:22.799
             Ain't it wonderful,
                    Archie?     

23:22.801 --> 23:26.736
            You weren't poisoned
                at all.         

23:26.738 --> 23:29.973
"You weren't poisoned           
at all."                        

23:31.509 --> 23:35.678
Tell Rabinowitz forget it.      
We ain't got no case!           

23:35.680 --> 23:37.347
That's wonderful, Edith.        

23:37.349 --> 23:39.216
Do you know                     
what you done to us?            

23:39.218 --> 23:43.253
You just cost us $50,000.       

23:43.255 --> 23:44.754
              I'm sorry, Archie.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.223
And where does                  
that leave me?                  

23:46.225 --> 23:47.624
      Walking around here       

23:47.626 --> 23:51.028
  with a lot of that antitoxin  
  cruising through my system,   

23:51.030 --> 23:53.930
     looking for some disease   
            to attack.          

23:56.100 --> 23:58.368
                  Arch,         
          better luck next time.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.703
                Arggh!          

24:10.314 --> 24:11.381
        Mm-mm-mm.               

24:11.383 --> 24:13.316
 Ma, this mushroom omelet       
        is great.               

24:13.318 --> 24:15.452
 Daddy, you ought to            
      try yours.                

24:15.454 --> 24:17.687
  I mean, why waste             
  the shot you had?             

24:21.725 --> 24:25.529
            It's good to see you
        eating again, Gloria.   

24:25.531 --> 24:28.565
          I'm glad you shook off
            that terrible cold. 

24:28.567 --> 24:32.635
     Ah, clamp up, will you?    
            Clamp up.           

24:32.637 --> 24:37.006
     She shook off the cold     
 and then she shook it onto me. 

24:39.544 --> 24:41.978
                    [SNEEZES]   

25:04.902 --> 25:07.604
