00:00.372 --> 00:01.799
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.800 --> 00:04.269
I just remember the
atmosphere back then.

00:04.303 --> 00:05.719
If you really do miss it,
maybe you should come with me

00:05.739 --> 00:07.505
on my rodeo tour.

00:07.896 --> 00:09.307
There's nothing like it.

00:09.341 --> 00:12.932
Is there any way you'd ever
consider hiring me again?

00:12.952 --> 00:15.813
Welcome back.

00:15.847 --> 00:17.698
Well, I just got
my old job back.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.884
That's great.

00:20.215 --> 00:23.334
- I should get going.
- Ty?

00:24.093 --> 00:25.656
I miss you.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.047
Take care of yourself.

00:56.785 --> 00:58.321
Hey.

00:59.298 --> 01:00.705
Hi.

01:00.725 --> 01:03.927
- I'm Georgie.
- Hanna.

01:03.961 --> 01:06.596
Haven't I seen you before,
like at Maggie's or something?

01:06.630 --> 01:08.931
My sister and I deliver
baking there sometimes.

01:08.965 --> 01:12.686
Oh, right!
Your rhubarb pie is crazy good.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.144
Thanks.

01:14.164 --> 01:16.967
So do your horses have names?

01:16.987 --> 01:20.009
Lucas and Alexander.

01:20.260 --> 01:22.287
I was trying to listen,
but I didn't hear much.

01:22.307 --> 01:24.955
What's wrong with them?

01:25.414 --> 01:30.318
My brother, Paul, was taking
some kids on a hay ride,

01:30.353 --> 01:34.589
and Lucas and Alexander started
going faster and faster.

01:34.624 --> 01:36.925
Paul couldn't get them
under control.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.061
Everyone was just really scared.

01:40.095 --> 01:43.366
My brother thinks there's
something wrong with the horses.

01:45.734 --> 01:47.235
I'll start by
ground driving them.

01:47.270 --> 01:49.371
I wanna see how
they work together as a team.

01:49.405 --> 01:51.473
- We should just sell them.
- Let's not be hasty.

01:51.507 --> 01:54.108
Give Amy a chance
to figure it out.

01:54.143 --> 01:56.477
Amy worked with a team of
clydesdales a few years back.

01:56.511 --> 01:58.980
She had them in shape
in no time.

01:59.014 --> 02:00.682
Well, I've never worked
with percherons before,

02:00.716 --> 02:03.384
but give me a few days,
and I'll see what I can do.

02:03.418 --> 02:04.952
We should discuss money.

02:04.987 --> 02:06.788
This is on the house.

02:06.822 --> 02:09.657
Oh, no, that's far too kind.

02:09.692 --> 02:12.159
You know, last year when the
road to Heartland was washed out,

02:12.194 --> 02:15.037
the folks from your colony
were a big help to us.

02:15.057 --> 02:17.698
It's the least we can do.

02:17.732 --> 02:20.767
Well, our garden is producing
far more strawberries

02:20.802 --> 02:22.736
than we know what to do with,

02:22.770 --> 02:25.038
so you'll at least take
some of those off our hands.

02:25.073 --> 02:26.473
Deal.

02:30.912 --> 02:35.048
So... three weeks
on the road with Casey.

02:35.083 --> 02:37.650
- That's a long trip.
- Yeah, it was.

02:37.685 --> 02:40.120
- How was it?
- Fine.

02:40.154 --> 02:42.723
- Just fine?
- Great!

02:42.757 --> 02:45.491
- And Casey?
- What about her?

02:45.526 --> 02:47.627
Dad, you spent three
weeks on the road together.

02:47.661 --> 02:49.696
I wanna know how it went?

02:49.730 --> 02:51.397
We had a good time.

02:51.432 --> 02:54.734
- And now?
- And now I'm back.

02:54.768 --> 02:59.519
So catch me up.
How's everything at home?

02:59.539 --> 03:02.141
Uh, it's good.
Everything's good.

03:02.175 --> 03:05.244
You know, um, Katie's feet
grew two sizes.

03:05.278 --> 03:07.912
I keep having to give
her old shoes away.

03:07.947 --> 03:09.615
And Amy, she's... I don't know.

03:09.649 --> 03:11.049
She's... I think it's better,

03:11.083 --> 03:13.051
but she's putting on
a brave face.

03:13.085 --> 03:15.987
Wait, wait. Brave face.
What do you mean?

03:16.022 --> 03:19.223
You know, Amy and Ty, they...

03:19.258 --> 03:23.161
- You don't know, do you?
- Know what, Lou?

03:25.230 --> 03:28.033
Give me the run
down, from the top.

03:28.067 --> 03:30.135
The cat - Mr. Whiskers -

03:30.169 --> 03:32.537
has been vomiting
for five days now.

03:32.571 --> 03:35.673
The x-rays show a foreign body
in the upper intestine.

03:35.707 --> 03:37.775
So what's the plan?

03:37.809 --> 03:39.722
Well, you're gonna make a
small incision in the abdomen,

03:39.742 --> 03:41.381
and search the intestines

03:41.401 --> 03:45.082
and remove
whatever he swallowed.

03:45.116 --> 03:48.137
You want to do the honours?

03:49.454 --> 03:50.954
Are you serious?

03:50.989 --> 03:53.256
Yeah. You're more than capable.

03:55.359 --> 03:57.260
Uh... yeah.

04:11.041 --> 04:12.676
I'm surprised those people that
dropped off the horses were using a truck.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.678
Why's that?

04:14.712 --> 04:17.747
Well, don't they use like...
buggies and horses to get around?

04:17.781 --> 04:19.182
Uh, no. You're confusing
them with the amish.

04:19.216 --> 04:21.218
Hutterites are different.

04:21.252 --> 04:23.352
They run big, modern farming
operations on their colonies.

04:23.386 --> 04:25.788
Oh...

04:25.823 --> 04:28.157
Well, Hanna told me
about these guys.

04:28.192 --> 04:30.326
Do you think you can fix them?

04:30.360 --> 04:32.695
Don't you mean "we."
You're still my partner, right?

04:32.730 --> 04:34.797
Right.

04:34.832 --> 04:36.899
Okay, well, let's get
this harness on Alexander.

04:36.934 --> 04:38.567
All right.

04:41.671 --> 04:43.706
I'm not seeing anything.

04:46.243 --> 04:49.555
It has to be in there
somewhere. Keep looking.

04:50.847 --> 04:53.915
There's no protrusion, redness.

04:53.950 --> 04:58.319
Everything seems clear.
I don't understand.

04:58.354 --> 05:00.655
Well, you're the one
who took the X-ray.

05:00.689 --> 05:04.325
Are you sure it wasn't just
an artifact on the screen?

05:04.360 --> 05:07.062
- Ty?
- Uh, I-I-I...

05:07.096 --> 05:08.396
I'm ninety-nine percent sure, Scott.

05:08.430 --> 05:09.931
That's not good enough.

05:09.966 --> 05:14.222
Next time be a 100% sure.
Step aside.

05:15.471 --> 05:16.771
There's your problem
right there.

05:16.805 --> 05:18.473
You're looking in
the wrong place.

05:18.507 --> 05:21.776
What's that right here,
adjacent to the stomach?

05:21.810 --> 05:23.513
- Uh...
- Come on, you should know this.

05:23.533 --> 05:25.079
It's-it's the duodenum.

05:25.113 --> 05:29.416
Good. Does that look
normal to you?

05:29.450 --> 05:32.887
- No.
- That's our foreign body.

05:32.921 --> 05:34.631
Looks like you didn't
cut open this cat

05:34.651 --> 05:36.657
for no reason after all.

05:36.691 --> 05:38.325
Uh...

05:41.704 --> 05:44.098
I'm gonna get some fresh air.

05:49.404 --> 05:51.692
We need to talk.

Shouldn't you be happy?

You never thought I was good
enough for Amy in the first place.

06:39.085 --> 06:40.886
Oh, come on.
You got it all wrong, Ty.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.522
I might have been hard
on you, but...

06:44.557 --> 06:46.528
Comes with the territory.

06:48.695 --> 06:51.343
So... why are you here then?

06:51.363 --> 06:54.332
Because, as usual,
I'm the last to know

06:54.367 --> 06:56.133
that you and Amy are
no longer together,

06:56.168 --> 06:58.837
so I just wanted to have
a chance to say goodbye.

06:58.871 --> 07:01.506
And whether you believe it
or not,

07:01.540 --> 07:04.744
I like you... sort of.

07:06.111 --> 07:09.347
So, in case this is more
than just a temporary break,

07:09.381 --> 07:13.728
I just wanted to say...
all the best.

07:15.841 --> 07:17.255
Okay.

07:17.417 --> 07:19.456
Good luck.

07:20.395 --> 07:21.926
Thanks.

07:22.716 --> 07:24.458
Happy trails.

07:26.898 --> 07:28.532
You're sure about this
"break" though, right?

07:28.566 --> 07:32.118
Because the way I see it,
a break and breaking up...

07:32.403 --> 07:34.304
same thing.

07:34.338 --> 07:36.440
Now, it might not be
any of my business,

07:36.474 --> 07:39.242
but you and Amy have been
back and forth so many times,

07:39.277 --> 07:41.477
I get whiplash
just thinking about it.

07:41.512 --> 07:43.146
Frankly, I'm tired of it.
You must be too.

07:43.180 --> 07:45.614
So if you're gonna break up,
just break up.

07:45.634 --> 07:47.217
Tim, this is something...

07:47.251 --> 07:51.521
And, so you know, it gets
easier - living with regret.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.523
It takes practice.
It stings at first,

07:53.557 --> 07:57.127
but you can drink,
that's what I did for years.

07:57.161 --> 08:00.162
And eventually...
you learn to live with it.

08:00.196 --> 08:02.770
You convince yourself
it was for the best.

08:02.790 --> 08:06.592
I've grown,
I'm a better person.

08:06.612 --> 08:08.237
And then it just becomes this...

08:08.271 --> 08:13.522
dull, empty feeling
that you live with.

08:13.911 --> 08:17.279
So... you got that
to look forward to.

08:17.314 --> 08:20.149
Good luck.

08:24.513 --> 08:26.788
- Hey, Lise?
- Hey!

08:26.823 --> 08:28.737
There's some fresh coffee
in there.

08:28.757 --> 08:30.426
Thanks.

08:30.460 --> 08:35.174
I have a letter here
addressed to...

08:35.195 --> 08:38.698
Mr. and Mrs. Bartlett.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.701
Has a nice ring to it,
doesn't it?

08:40.721 --> 08:45.073
Mm-hmm. It does. Too
bad it's not my name.

08:45.107 --> 08:48.476
Well, it could be, couldn't it?
If you wanted it to be.

08:48.510 --> 08:51.746
Uh, yeah, I suppose.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.981
Lisa Stillman's been
my name my entire life,

08:54.015 --> 08:56.450
but... not even with Dan
did I change it.

08:56.485 --> 08:59.115
I'm not gonna change it now.

08:59.135 --> 09:01.389
But we didn't really talk about
that before we got married,

09:01.423 --> 09:04.845
you didn't expect me
to change my name, did you?

09:06.060 --> 09:09.429
Jack?

09:09.463 --> 09:12.766
So your total comes to $67.80.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.834
Oh! And I'll take
one of these too...

09:14.869 --> 09:16.536
If you sign it for me?

09:16.570 --> 09:19.039
Of course. I'd love to.

09:19.073 --> 09:20.740
You just missed my dad.

09:20.775 --> 09:22.409
He was in here talking
about what a great time

09:22.443 --> 09:23.810
you two had
on the road together.

09:23.844 --> 09:26.972
Really?
Worst three weeks of my life.

09:28.549 --> 09:29.749
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

09:29.784 --> 09:31.651
We had a great time...

09:31.685 --> 09:33.052
When he wasn't driving too fast,

09:33.086 --> 09:34.888
and spilling coffee in my truck.

09:34.922 --> 09:37.723
Yeah, he can be kind of
inconsiderate sometimes.

09:37.757 --> 09:38.590
Yeah, and then
he'll go and do something

09:38.625 --> 09:40.326
completely charming and sweet

09:40.360 --> 09:41.894
and you can't help but like the guy.
It's very annoying.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.662
Oh, you are describing
my entire childhood.

09:43.696 --> 09:45.864
You must be so scarred.

09:45.899 --> 09:47.499
You can read all about it
in my book.

09:47.534 --> 09:49.435
- I can't wait.
- Okay.

09:49.469 --> 09:51.837
Well, you know, we go for lunch
or something sometime.

09:51.871 --> 09:53.739
Yeah, I'd like that.

09:53.773 --> 09:55.974
Better idea. You and my dad

09:56.008 --> 09:57.810
should come by the ranch
tomorrow night for dinner

09:57.844 --> 09:59.244
and get to know
the entire family.

09:59.278 --> 10:01.647
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:01.681 --> 10:03.248
Okay, sure.

10:03.282 --> 10:05.183
Enjoy the book.

10:05.217 --> 10:07.486
Thanks. And, uh, I've never met
a famous author before.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.120
Oh, bad news.
You still haven't.

10:09.155 --> 10:10.721
Oh, don't be so modest.

10:10.756 --> 10:13.558
Everybody in this town
knows who Lou Fleming is.

10:13.592 --> 10:16.194
You know what? You I like.

10:16.228 --> 10:17.963
My dad better not mess this up.

10:17.997 --> 10:20.531
Bye.

10:20.566 --> 10:22.334
See ya.

10:31.078 --> 10:33.535
Good.

10:35.013 --> 10:38.215
- I really don't get it.
- What?

10:38.249 --> 10:40.518
Well, they're pulling on
the reins nice and evenly,

10:40.552 --> 10:42.687
they've got nice pressure.

10:42.721 --> 10:45.722
So far they seem to be
the perfect team.

10:45.756 --> 10:48.258
Then why
did Paul lose control during the hay ride?

10:48.293 --> 10:51.228
Um... I don't know.

10:51.262 --> 10:53.263
Should we keep
ground driving them?

10:53.298 --> 10:55.199
No. I have a better idea.

10:55.233 --> 10:58.869
Whoa, boys.

10:58.903 --> 11:01.137
I think it's time to try something
a little more challenging.

11:10.982 --> 11:12.883
And whoa...

11:12.917 --> 11:15.752
Good boys.

11:15.786 --> 11:18.154
There is nothing wrong
with these horses.

11:18.188 --> 11:20.689
They're doing exactly
what they're supposed to do.

11:20.724 --> 11:21.957
Maybe they got spooked
on the hay ride

11:21.992 --> 11:23.926
by like a snake or something.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.594
Well, apparently,
the hay ride

11:25.629 --> 11:28.898
wasn't the first time
they acted up.

11:28.932 --> 11:30.633
Yeah, I'm thinking this has a
lot more to do with the driver

11:30.667 --> 11:32.168
than it does with the horses.

11:32.202 --> 11:34.469
You mean Hanna's brother.

11:34.504 --> 11:37.439
Only one way to find out.

11:37.473 --> 11:39.074
Hey!

11:39.108 --> 11:41.109
Oh, hey, dad. You know,
you just missed Casey.

11:41.144 --> 11:43.278
She was in getting supplies.

11:43.312 --> 11:45.881
Oh, yeah! You two are coming for
dinner tomorrow, so don't forget.

11:45.916 --> 11:47.783
And tell Casey she doesn't
have to bring anything.

11:47.817 --> 11:49.384
Y-you invited
Casey for dinner?

11:49.419 --> 11:50.519
There you go. Enjoy.
Thank you.

11:50.553 --> 11:52.087
Yeah, I did.

11:52.121 --> 11:54.022
And she's not a vegetarian
or anything is she?

11:54.057 --> 11:55.790
'Cause I was gonna make
a braised lamb shank.

11:55.824 --> 11:57.359
- Here you go.
- Lou. Lou, stop.

11:57.393 --> 11:59.227
You have to call Casey
and tell her dinner's off.

11:59.262 --> 12:00.929
What? Why would I do that?

12:00.963 --> 12:03.532
Because I never asked you
to invite Casey for dinner.

12:03.566 --> 12:05.500
Dad, come on. don't
you think it is about time

12:05.535 --> 12:06.868
that your family meet the woman

12:06.902 --> 12:08.469
you've been spending
so much time with?

12:08.503 --> 12:10.638
It's not that serious, Lou.

12:10.673 --> 12:13.240
We... we had a little fun
and now it's winding down.

12:13.275 --> 12:14.776
- Winding down?
- Yes, to a natural

12:14.810 --> 12:16.510
and mutually understood ending.

12:16.545 --> 12:18.947
Uh-huh. And does, um,
Casey know about this

12:18.981 --> 12:21.115
"natural and mutually
understood ending"?

12:21.149 --> 12:24.185
Of-of course...
On-on some level.

12:24.219 --> 12:26.353
Unbelievable! You haven't
actually told her yet.

12:26.388 --> 12:28.855
It's an unfinished conversation.

12:28.890 --> 12:30.824
Dad, a woman does not
accept an invitation

12:30.858 --> 12:32.726
to meet a man's family

12:32.760 --> 12:34.761
unless she thinks the
relationship is going somewhere.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.253
Well, how do I know what
a woman's thinking?

12:36.273 --> 12:37.465
I don't read minds.

12:37.499 --> 12:39.466
You know what you're doing?
You're leading her on.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.602
- No, I'm not.
- Yes. Yes, you are,

12:41.636 --> 12:43.369
and there is nothing
I can't stand more

12:43.404 --> 12:45.772
than a man who leads a woman on.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.741
You know what? If you wanna
cancel this dinner, you go ahead.

12:47.775 --> 12:50.276
I'm not doing
your dirty work for you.

12:50.311 --> 12:54.214
I really liked her, dad.
She bought my book.

12:54.248 --> 12:56.570
I knew you'd mess this up.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.895
We're just gonna
take this nice and slow.

13:06.915 --> 13:09.322
An easy walk around the yard.

13:12.679 --> 13:15.200
- You all right?
- Fine.

13:21.875 --> 13:23.242
Okay, you need a
little more contact.

13:23.276 --> 13:25.544
Okay.

13:25.578 --> 13:27.046
You have too much
slack in your lines.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.813
Okay, okay.

13:28.848 --> 13:31.650
- Okay, pull up.
- I know what I'm doing.

13:31.684 --> 13:33.818
- Pull back on the reins.
- I'm pulling back!

13:33.853 --> 13:35.920
- Keep them on the road!
- Paul, just pull back!

13:35.955 --> 13:37.322
All right!

13:37.357 --> 13:39.758
- Paul!
- Whoa!

13:39.792 --> 13:41.293
Easy!

13:43.963 --> 13:48.108
Easy, boys. Good boys.

13:48.815 --> 13:52.327
And... whoa, boys. Whoa...

13:54.206 --> 13:56.941
I thought you were supposed
to be fixing these horses?

13:56.976 --> 14:00.879
Lucas and Alexander aren't
the problem, are they?

14:00.913 --> 14:04.315
Look, Paul, you don't have
to be embarrassed.

14:04.349 --> 14:06.426
I can give you some pointers
on how to drive?

14:06.446 --> 14:08.151
I know how to drive.

14:08.171 --> 14:10.988
Okay. Um...
Then maybe you're afraid

14:11.022 --> 14:13.090
and you're telegraphing
your fear to the horses.

14:13.124 --> 14:15.287
Is this what you do when you can't
figure out how to fix a horse?

14:15.307 --> 14:16.479
You blame the owner?

14:16.499 --> 14:18.195
Well... I'm not blaming.

14:18.229 --> 14:20.077
Look, I'm just trying
to help you.

14:20.097 --> 14:21.566
I don't want your help.

14:21.586 --> 14:23.701
- Why did you hire me?
- I didn't.

14:23.735 --> 14:25.826
My dad thought it'd be
a good idea.

14:25.950 --> 14:27.613
He was wrong.

14:36.446 --> 14:38.314
Hey, Ty. Catch.

14:39.817 --> 14:41.584
What's this?

14:41.619 --> 14:43.753
That's the foreign body
I removed

14:43.787 --> 14:47.657
from Mr. Whiskers intestine...
a nice shiny penny.

14:47.691 --> 14:49.299
You should've stuck around
for the extraction.

14:49.319 --> 14:51.160
It was pretty cool.

14:51.194 --> 14:53.829
Sorry I missed it.

14:53.863 --> 14:55.531
You know, Ty,
I double checked that X-ray

14:55.565 --> 14:58.300
before we started the operation.

14:58.335 --> 15:00.902
I knew it wasn't just
an artifact on the screen.

15:00.937 --> 15:03.606
Well, then, why did you ask me?

15:03.640 --> 15:06.942
I wanted to see how
you would react.

15:06.976 --> 15:09.911
Sometimes things don't go
according to plan during surgery.

15:09.946 --> 15:11.780
So, next time,
just take a breath,

15:11.814 --> 15:13.348
trust your instincts.

15:16.152 --> 15:18.887
I need you to stay overnight
and watch Mr. Whiskers.

15:18.921 --> 15:20.555
Oh, I've been here
since 6 a.m., Scott.

15:20.589 --> 15:22.758
Is that a problem?

15:22.792 --> 15:25.226
No, it's not a problem.

15:25.261 --> 15:29.271
Good. Keep the penny.
It's a souvenir.

15:30.699 --> 15:32.467
See you in the morning.

15:35.404 --> 15:38.673
Hi, Alexander. Lucas.

15:38.707 --> 15:40.808
You want a carrot?

15:46.112 --> 15:48.248
There...

15:50.886 --> 15:54.321
Hanna?

15:54.355 --> 15:57.158
Hanna, what're doing?
Wait!

15:57.192 --> 15:59.560
Wait up! Hanna!

15:59.594 --> 16:01.728
Hanna!

16:12.549 --> 16:15.813
Lou, when are Hanna and her mom
dropping off the baking at the diner?

16:15.818 --> 16:18.399
Uh, they usually drop it off in
the morning around nine, I think.

16:18.419 --> 16:20.968
But I'm not sure if they're
doing a delivery today.

16:20.988 --> 16:23.056
Did you want some breakfast or...

16:23.090 --> 16:25.392
Oh, okay, bye.

16:25.426 --> 16:26.926
Hey, Lou, when
you're in town today,

16:26.961 --> 16:29.028
can you stop by the vet clinic
and grab the west nile vaccine?

16:29.063 --> 16:31.231
Mm-hmm.

16:31.265 --> 16:33.233
- What's that look for?
- What look?

16:33.267 --> 16:35.668
Like you're judging me.

16:35.702 --> 16:37.871
Why would I judge you
because you're avoiding Ty?

16:37.905 --> 16:39.538
It's perfectly human.

16:39.573 --> 16:42.275
Cowardly maybe,
but... perfectly human.

16:42.309 --> 16:43.609
- Just this once, please?
- Look...

16:43.643 --> 16:46.145
I will do my sisterly duties
for you this time,

16:46.180 --> 16:48.982
but... you can't avoid him
forever.

16:53.286 --> 16:56.327
- So...
- So?

16:56.762 --> 17:00.158
There's... something
I need to tell you.

17:00.193 --> 17:02.395
Oh, great. You've got another love
child out there somewhere, don't you?

17:02.429 --> 17:05.017
What? No.

17:05.832 --> 17:09.634
I-I have just one love child.

17:09.667 --> 17:11.736
Secretly married?
Is that what it is?

17:11.771 --> 17:14.836
No, I-I told you all my secrets
on the road trip.

17:14.856 --> 17:17.532
I know, but I was only half
listening. Kinda boring.

17:17.553 --> 17:20.383
No...

17:21.480 --> 17:23.114
I got you something.

17:23.147 --> 17:25.049
What? What is this?

17:25.083 --> 17:28.051
It's just a little something
to thank you for...

17:28.086 --> 17:30.004
turning what could've been
a very lonely trip

17:30.024 --> 17:32.390
into something really special.

17:32.425 --> 17:35.192
You told me you like
to fly fish.

17:35.227 --> 17:38.095
The guy at the store
said you'd like it.

17:41.901 --> 17:43.969
You hate it.

17:46.805 --> 17:50.107
It's perfect. Really, I...

17:50.142 --> 17:51.708
Thank you.

17:51.743 --> 17:53.677
Look, I'm sorry.

17:53.711 --> 17:54.912
I know that you said
you had something to tell me

17:54.947 --> 17:58.381
and I...
I totally interrupted you.

17:58.416 --> 18:01.318
I wa-yeah, I
was going say...

18:01.352 --> 18:03.687
I was just going to say...

18:03.721 --> 18:05.422
that I hope you're ready
for dinner tonight,

18:05.457 --> 18:07.257
because meeting my family
is a big deal

18:07.291 --> 18:10.293
and you can always back out.

18:10.328 --> 18:12.195
No, actually, I'm
really looking forward to it.

18:12.229 --> 18:13.629
Great.

18:16.433 --> 18:18.380
That's great.

18:26.410 --> 18:28.043
Hanna!

18:28.078 --> 18:31.013
Uh, hi, Georgie.

18:31.047 --> 18:32.848
Are you gonna tell on me?

18:32.883 --> 18:35.671
Uh, no. Tell what?

18:35.691 --> 18:37.681
I wasn't supposed to be
at Heartland this morning.

18:37.701 --> 18:40.622
I barely got home in time
to help with the baking.

18:40.642 --> 18:44.193
If my mom found out,
I'd be in a lot of trouble.

18:44.227 --> 18:46.628
Well, I won't say anything.

18:46.663 --> 18:48.730
Thank you.

18:48.765 --> 18:51.833
You know, you didn't have
to run away this morning.

18:51.867 --> 18:54.636
I mean you can come see Lucas and
Alexander whenever you want.

18:54.671 --> 18:55.970
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:56.005 --> 18:58.740
Your secret's safe with me.

18:58.775 --> 19:00.709
- Hanna? Come!
- I better go.

19:00.743 --> 19:04.012
If you want,
you can come stop by later.

19:04.046 --> 19:06.047
- I'll try.
- Okay.

19:09.985 --> 19:13.188
You coming Katie?

19:13.222 --> 19:15.623
My cowboy hat's lost!

19:15.657 --> 19:17.225
Oh, no, I-I think
I saw it in your room.

19:17.259 --> 19:20.661
You go check.

19:20.696 --> 19:23.230
- Jack...
- Mm-hmm?

19:23.264 --> 19:26.600
- You don't wear a wedding ring.
- What's that?

19:26.635 --> 19:29.570
You don't
wear a wedding ring, right?

19:29.604 --> 19:31.138
- Right.
- And you've made that choice

19:31.172 --> 19:33.407
and I respect that.

19:33.442 --> 19:35.209
Just like you can respect
that I...

19:35.243 --> 19:36.944
don't wanna change my name.

19:36.978 --> 19:40.814
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:40.834 --> 19:42.817
It's not
really the same thing, but...

19:42.837 --> 19:44.918
What, I'm sorry?

19:44.953 --> 19:48.521
I said, it's not really
the same thing.

19:48.556 --> 19:50.423
Well, no, but they are
two traditions

19:50.458 --> 19:51.858
that we've chosen not to follow

19:51.892 --> 19:54.361
because we're a
non-traditional couple.

19:54.395 --> 19:56.916
Well, maybe some traditions
are worth holding on to.

19:56.936 --> 19:59.366
You mean like wearing
a wedding ring, for example?

19:59.400 --> 20:01.968
Or like changing
your last name, for example.

20:02.002 --> 20:04.304
Oh! There it is!

20:04.338 --> 20:06.173
Oh, looking good, Katie.

20:06.207 --> 20:08.240
- Bye, GG.
- Bye.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.242
We're gonna go
see pogie, GG...?

20:10.277 --> 20:13.379
GG, yeah. Great grandpa.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.949
Oh! Oh, that's good.

20:15.983 --> 20:17.543
Hi!

20:19.587 --> 20:22.789
Here you go. One dozen
west nile vaccines.

20:22.823 --> 20:27.106
Thanks. We keep on
running out of this stuff.

20:27.126 --> 20:29.307
So you've been inoculating
a lot of horses lately?

20:29.327 --> 20:32.095
Yeah, tons. Whole... herds.

20:33.826 --> 20:35.367
Right.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.970
So you're obviously not here
because Amy sent you?

20:38.004 --> 20:41.239
What? No, that's... crazy.

20:41.607 --> 20:44.012
It's okay, Lou. I get it.

20:45.066 --> 20:46.684
So how are you?

20:46.704 --> 20:48.313
I'm good.

20:48.347 --> 20:51.984
Yeah? 'Cause you don't...
You don't look so good.

20:52.822 --> 20:53.685
Thanks.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.121
I just mean you look tired.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.255
Well, I just worked
a night shift

20:57.289 --> 20:59.936
that sorta... kept going, so...

20:59.956 --> 21:01.593
By choice?

21:02.003 --> 21:03.661
Uh... not exactly.

21:03.695 --> 21:06.197
Scott's been on my case
ever since I got back.

21:06.232 --> 21:07.936
I think he's holding
a bit of a grudge, but...

21:07.956 --> 21:10.735
What do you mean?

21:10.769 --> 21:12.570
Well, he wasn't
exactly happy when I quit

21:12.605 --> 21:14.271
to go work at
the wildlife reserve,

21:14.305 --> 21:17.508
so I think he's still upset
about that.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.443
Well, I've known Scott
for a long time,

21:19.477 --> 21:22.840
and I think if that were true,
he would be straight with you.

21:25.283 --> 21:29.053
Anyway, I've gotta go.
It was good to see you, Ty.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.361
You too.

21:35.585 --> 21:38.094
Hey, Lou?

21:38.799 --> 21:41.498
Yeah?

21:41.864 --> 21:44.606
Can you tell Amy
that I said uh...

21:46.671 --> 21:48.705
Tell her that I said hello.

21:49.438 --> 21:51.659
I will.

21:56.413 --> 21:58.481
Are you being
a good boy, Lucas?

21:58.515 --> 22:01.084
You're not eating all of
Alexander's food again, are you?

22:01.118 --> 22:04.587
Lucas is greedier
than a prize-winning hog.

22:04.621 --> 22:08.831
Hey, Hanna, do you know why
Paul lost control of the wagon?

22:12.578 --> 22:14.469
Promise you won't say anything.

22:14.489 --> 22:16.732
Not to my dad. Not to anyone.

22:16.766 --> 22:20.302
- Okay.
- Promise.

22:20.336 --> 22:24.807
Paul doesn't like horses.
He likes machines.

22:24.841 --> 22:27.109
My brother would much
rather be fixing engines

22:27.143 --> 22:30.145
than taking care
of Lucas and Alexander.

22:30.180 --> 22:32.280
Well, then, why was he
taking those kids on a hay ride?

22:32.315 --> 22:34.950
Because my dad asked him to.

22:34.984 --> 22:38.553
The last thing Paul would ever
want to do is disappoint him.

22:38.588 --> 22:42.023
So then that story about
the horses was just a cover?

22:42.057 --> 22:43.991
He's ashamed.

22:44.026 --> 22:46.394
He doesn't want my dad
to know the truth.

22:46.429 --> 22:50.031
That's why he wants
to sell them.

22:50.065 --> 22:52.834
I don't want them to go.

22:52.868 --> 22:56.470
Sometimes I sneak into
the barn just to see them.

22:56.504 --> 22:57.972
There's lots of weeding
and canning I should be doing,

22:58.006 --> 23:01.909
but... Lucas and Alexander
are the best part of my day.

23:15.523 --> 23:17.758
What are you doing here?

23:17.792 --> 23:20.160
We invited her.

23:20.194 --> 23:23.430
Meh foen. Kumps geya.

23:23.465 --> 23:27.167
Paul, I know why
you wanna sell the horses.

23:27.201 --> 23:29.702
I think you're making
a big mistake.

23:29.737 --> 23:32.005
If you can't fix them, then
I don't have any other choice.

23:32.039 --> 23:33.706
Lucas and Alexander
are perfectly fine.

23:33.741 --> 23:35.441
You don't know that.

23:35.476 --> 23:39.789
Yes I do. I've...
driven the wagon before.

23:39.950 --> 23:41.214
When?

23:41.249 --> 23:43.583
Lots of times,
when no one's looking.

23:43.617 --> 23:44.850
This is your fault.
You did something wrong.

23:44.885 --> 23:46.753
You messed them up.

23:46.787 --> 23:48.632
That's what I'll tell dad
if you make a fuss.

23:48.652 --> 23:49.972
Stop it! You're such a liar!

23:49.992 --> 23:51.724
- Okay, Georgie...
- Get in the truck.

24:02.981 --> 24:04.428
No, we really
lucked out though.

24:04.448 --> 24:05.849
I mean the weather was good,

24:05.884 --> 24:07.751
we hardly had
any road construction.

24:07.786 --> 24:09.452
- Mm.
- That sounds like a perfect trip.

24:09.487 --> 24:11.789
Yeah, until Tim hit a dog.

24:11.823 --> 24:13.823
No. You're kidding!

24:13.857 --> 24:16.059
I nicked it. Barely.

24:16.093 --> 24:18.495
- Was he okay?
- He was fine.

24:18.529 --> 24:20.197
Yeah, five hundred
dollars in vet bills later.

24:22.667 --> 24:24.267
Okay, it's time
for you to go to bed.

24:24.302 --> 24:25.635
It is way past your bedtime.

24:25.670 --> 24:27.036
Let me do it. You stay.

24:27.071 --> 24:28.938
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, of course.

24:28.972 --> 24:30.039
Come on, honey,
let's get you ready for bed.

24:30.074 --> 24:32.675
I want Casey read me a story?

24:32.710 --> 24:35.377
Oh! Well, if Casey wants to
read you a story, let's do that.

24:35.412 --> 24:37.046
Are you kidding?
I would love to.

24:37.081 --> 24:39.716
Okay, but only two stories.
That's it.

24:39.750 --> 24:41.535
I'll try my best.

24:43.420 --> 24:46.189
Be strong.

24:49.926 --> 24:53.161
Did I mention
how much I like her?

24:53.196 --> 24:55.264
- I like her too.
- Yeah, she's great, dad.

24:55.298 --> 24:57.966
Yeah. Funny,
smart, beautiful...

24:58.000 --> 25:01.903
Only an idiot
would let a girl like that go.

25:01.938 --> 25:03.404
I can't believe you hit a dog.

25:03.439 --> 25:05.874
I just nicked it!

25:08.644 --> 25:11.847
What was that about?

25:11.881 --> 25:14.249
I made the mistake of confiding
in Lou about Casey,

25:14.283 --> 25:16.818
which is, frankly,
none of her business.

25:16.853 --> 25:19.920
Yeah, I guess it's none
of my business either.

25:19.955 --> 25:23.995
Jack, sometimes two people
go different directions.

25:25.193 --> 25:26.761
Happened to you and Lisa.

25:26.795 --> 25:28.563
You broke up for awhile
before you got married.

25:28.597 --> 25:32.734
That's true...
but I was being an idiot.

25:41.743 --> 25:46.333
Hello? Walter. Yes, hi.

25:46.915 --> 25:50.985
Um... actually, can you hold
for one moment?

25:51.019 --> 25:52.619
It's Hanna's dad.
He wants to know

25:52.654 --> 25:54.288
what's going on with Lucas
and Alexander.

25:54.322 --> 25:55.922
What're you gonna say?

25:55.956 --> 25:58.024
I think we should
tell him the truth.

25:58.058 --> 26:00.126
Well, you can't.
We promised Hanna.

26:00.161 --> 26:02.228
I know. But Georgie, keeping
this from Walter is wrong.

26:02.263 --> 26:04.878
Amy, a promise is a promise.

26:08.002 --> 26:09.936
Hi. Um... you know,

26:09.970 --> 26:12.939
I'm actually just gonna need
a few days to work with them.

26:12.973 --> 26:16.669
No, I know, but...

26:17.411 --> 26:21.147
Okay. Yeah, I understand.

26:21.182 --> 26:24.117
Okay. Have a good night.

26:24.151 --> 26:26.286
He's picking up
the horses tomorrow.

26:26.306 --> 26:27.687
Why?

26:27.721 --> 26:30.823
He found a buyer.

26:32.826 --> 26:36.329
Okay, so give me the run down.

26:36.363 --> 26:38.798
Well, the cow
gave birth last week,

26:38.832 --> 26:40.899
and she's been off her feed
for a few days now, so...

26:40.934 --> 26:42.100
judging from the sounds
of her stomach,

26:42.135 --> 26:45.337
I'd say it's a displaced
abomasum.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.706
How do we fix it?

26:47.740 --> 26:49.741
Make a small
incision in the abdomen,

26:49.775 --> 26:52.544
reach in and untwist
the stomach manually.

26:52.578 --> 26:54.947
- Easy, right?
- In and out.

26:54.981 --> 26:56.849
Shouldn't take more
than an hour.

26:56.883 --> 26:58.483
An hour, huh?

26:58.517 --> 27:01.422
Yeah, well... give or take.

27:02.087 --> 27:03.822
All right.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.624
I'll time you, then.

27:06.659 --> 27:09.227
Starting now.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.496
What do you mean?

27:11.530 --> 27:14.632
Well, I wanna see if you can
do this surgery in under an hour.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.533
You want me to
do the surgery?

27:16.568 --> 27:19.703
59 minutes and 38 seconds.

27:20.196 --> 27:22.073
37.

27:26.845 --> 27:29.546
Oh, that sounds like a
private family situation.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.815
I don't know that
I wanna get involved.

27:31.850 --> 27:34.184
No, we're not asking you
to get involved, grandpa.

27:34.218 --> 27:37.307
Well, then what're you asking?

27:37.927 --> 27:40.198
We just need a tiny favour.

27:42.927 --> 27:45.896
So... talked to Casey yet?

27:45.930 --> 27:47.898
No, I haven't
talked to Casey yet.

27:47.932 --> 27:49.832
Why is it so important
to you, Lou?

27:49.867 --> 27:52.302
You're like a terrier gnawing
at my pant leg.

27:52.336 --> 27:55.772
Excuse me? You know what?
Forget I said anything.

27:55.806 --> 27:58.775
No, I wanna know. Since when did you
become president of the Casey Fan Club?

27:58.809 --> 28:00.443
Is it just because
she bought your book?

28:00.477 --> 28:04.680
- That is not the reason.
- Well, then what is it?

28:04.715 --> 28:07.750
- It's hard to explain.
- Try me.

28:07.785 --> 28:09.852
You know what? I
admit I wasn't crazy

28:09.887 --> 28:12.054
about grandpa marrying Lisa
in secret,

28:12.088 --> 28:15.124
but now that they're together,
I feel like he has a person.

28:15.158 --> 28:16.926
Someone who will always
be there for him,

28:16.960 --> 28:19.796
and it gives me comfort
knowing that, okay?

28:19.830 --> 28:23.065
And I just... I want you
to have a person too, okay?

28:23.099 --> 28:25.034
I'm not saying
it has to be Casey.

28:25.068 --> 28:26.668
I'm just saying that you deserve

28:26.702 --> 28:28.549
to have someone special
in your life.

28:28.569 --> 28:30.039
Dad, you're...

28:30.073 --> 28:32.607
When you're not being
a major pain in the butt,

28:32.642 --> 28:36.178
you are a funny, gentle guy
with a big heart.

28:36.212 --> 28:38.713
A ridiculously big heart...
and I just...

28:38.748 --> 28:41.015
I just want you to be happy.

28:44.286 --> 28:47.188
Casey does make me happy.

28:47.222 --> 28:49.658
We laughed the entire time
we were on that road trip.

28:49.692 --> 28:53.161
I have never met anyone
like her.

28:53.195 --> 28:55.563
Then why are you
pushing her away?

28:59.435 --> 29:02.303
Oh, dad...

29:02.338 --> 29:05.373
You're falling in love
with her...

29:05.407 --> 29:08.142
and that terrifies you.

29:17.085 --> 29:19.252
So Amy had a couple errands
to run in town.

29:19.287 --> 29:21.088
She shouldn't be long.

29:21.122 --> 29:22.857
Oh, we'll load up the
horses and be on our way.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.943
Yeah, I'll give
you a hand in a minute.

29:24.963 --> 29:29.096
Uh... I'm just wondering...

29:29.130 --> 29:33.133
Do either of you two fellas know
anything about diesel engines?

29:33.167 --> 29:36.169
I've been tinkering on this hunk
of junk tractor all morning,

29:36.204 --> 29:38.705
and I... for the life of me,
I can't get it to run.

29:38.739 --> 29:40.507
Paul is the best mechanic
on the colony.

29:40.541 --> 29:42.442
You don't say?

29:42.477 --> 29:43.710
Why don't you have a look?

29:43.744 --> 29:45.522
Don't we have to meet
the buyer soon?

29:45.542 --> 29:48.180
We still have some time.

29:48.215 --> 29:49.983
Appreciate it.

29:57.057 --> 29:58.758
Are you sure they're
making their delivery today?

29:58.778 --> 30:00.959
I hope so.

30:00.994 --> 30:04.863
They better hurry up 'cause grandpa
can only stall Walter for so long.

30:04.898 --> 30:08.600
Look.
There they are.

30:13.868 --> 30:15.674
Hanna!

30:15.708 --> 30:17.042
Your dad's at Heartland.

30:17.076 --> 30:20.045
He's gonna sell Alexander
and Lucas.

30:20.079 --> 30:22.553
- I know.
- But we have to stop him.

30:22.573 --> 30:23.715
How?

30:23.750 --> 30:25.584
You said you've
driven the wagon, right?

30:25.618 --> 30:28.386
Well, we need to show your dad and
then he'll know Paul was lying.

30:28.421 --> 30:30.923
- No.
- Why not?

30:30.957 --> 30:34.025
It'll humiliate him.
I can't do that to my brother.

30:34.060 --> 30:36.227
Well, what about
Lucas and Alexander?

30:36.262 --> 30:39.797
I'd rather lose them
than risk my brother hating me.

30:39.831 --> 30:41.499
Do you have a brother
or sister, Georgie?

30:41.534 --> 30:44.135
- Yeah.
- So you understand.

30:48.075 --> 30:50.656
At least come say goodbye.

31:03.107 --> 31:04.440
And try it now.

31:11.946 --> 31:16.118
Boy, you made that look easy.
Good job!

31:16.152 --> 31:19.121
Quite the son you got there.

31:29.132 --> 31:31.000
Hanna?

31:31.034 --> 31:33.402
Vos tuesten doh?

31:33.436 --> 31:35.605
I came to say goodbye
to the horses.

31:35.639 --> 31:38.007
Mom said it was okay.

31:43.213 --> 31:45.280
You won't separate them, right?

31:45.315 --> 31:47.716
That'll depend. We may have to.

31:47.750 --> 31:49.584
They won't like being separated.

31:49.619 --> 31:51.786
They've always have each other.

31:51.821 --> 31:53.688
Say your goodbyes quickly. We
have a buyer waiting to meet us.

31:53.723 --> 31:55.124
Come on. Let's get them loaded.

31:57.060 --> 31:59.694
Come on,
let's get them loaded on.

32:02.832 --> 32:05.967
Goodbye.

32:06.002 --> 32:07.502
It'll be okay.

32:11.106 --> 32:13.474
We shouldn't sell them.

32:15.891 --> 32:19.047
It's not Lucas and Alexander's
fault I lost control of the wagon.

32:23.452 --> 32:25.753
What do you mean?

32:25.787 --> 32:27.922
I'm no good with horses.

32:27.956 --> 32:30.024
I don't understand them,
not the way Hanna does.

32:33.962 --> 32:36.263
She can even drive the wagon.

32:36.297 --> 32:38.265
Why did you keep this from me?

32:38.299 --> 32:40.634
I didn't want you
to be disappointed.

32:41.218 --> 32:43.871
I'm sorry, dad.

32:43.905 --> 32:46.040
Is what your brother said true?

32:46.492 --> 32:50.551
Yes. I can show you.

32:59.052 --> 33:02.276
Good. Lucas, good.

33:16.870 --> 33:19.238
- Damn it.
- What's wrong?

33:19.272 --> 33:21.840
Well, it's really twisted out.

33:21.874 --> 33:23.775
All right, step aside.
I'll do it.

33:23.810 --> 33:25.944
No, no, I... I got it.

33:25.979 --> 33:28.247
- I said step aside.
- I said I got it!

33:37.837 --> 33:39.455
There.

33:39.475 --> 33:40.892
It's back in place.

33:40.927 --> 33:43.929
- You sure?
- Yeah.

33:43.963 --> 33:46.927
- How sure?
- A hundred percent.

33:53.305 --> 33:56.587
All right,
everything seems fine.

33:57.976 --> 34:01.412
Good job.
Better close her back up.

34:01.447 --> 34:04.682
You only have
twelve minutes left.

34:09.588 --> 34:12.389
Last night...
dinner with the family...

34:12.422 --> 34:14.925
I'll tell you,
you really won everybody over.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.094
That's a tough crowd, trust me.

34:17.129 --> 34:19.797
Didn't win you
over though, did I?

34:19.831 --> 34:22.431
I'm not a fool, Tim.

34:22.467 --> 34:24.935
I grew up around rodeo cowboys
and that whole moving on

34:24.969 --> 34:26.734
to different towns,
different women

34:26.754 --> 34:29.473
is just second nature
to you guys.

34:29.507 --> 34:32.359
Well, I haven't been a
rodeo cowboy in a long time.

34:32.379 --> 34:34.311
Yeah, but you still have
that "moving on" look in your eye,

34:34.344 --> 34:36.846
and you have ever since
we got back from that trip.

34:36.880 --> 34:38.415
You know what I'm talking about.

34:38.449 --> 34:41.185
Casey, wait. Wait, wait.
You got this all wrong.

34:41.219 --> 34:44.788
Let's not make this harder
than it needs to be.

34:47.858 --> 34:49.559
I'll see you around.

34:58.716 --> 35:00.371
Thank you for your help, Jack.

35:00.391 --> 35:02.137
I'm sorry we wasted Amy's time.

35:02.172 --> 35:05.074
Oh, you didn't waste
her time at all.

35:05.108 --> 35:07.643
The important thing is,
you know the truth now.

35:07.678 --> 35:10.546
I guess the rest is up to you.

35:10.581 --> 35:13.782
- Have a good day, Walter.
- You too, Jack.

35:27.326 --> 35:31.483
Who among us could fix
that tractor as quickly as you did?

35:31.620 --> 35:33.823
None, to be sure.

35:35.538 --> 35:38.862
So don't for a minute think
that I'm not proud of you.

35:51.920 --> 35:53.755
You need to
work on your sutures.

35:53.789 --> 35:55.489
A few of your bites
were too shallow.

35:55.523 --> 35:58.259
Next time, be more consistent.

35:58.293 --> 36:01.236
Is this how it's gonna be
from now on?

36:01.256 --> 36:03.564
What?

36:03.598 --> 36:05.999
It's pretty obvious
you got a problem with me.

36:06.033 --> 36:07.801
I mean, I know you're
disappointed that I quit

36:07.835 --> 36:09.638
and I went to work
at the wildlife reserve,

36:09.658 --> 36:11.239
but you can't keep
taking it out on me,

36:11.259 --> 36:13.440
especially during surgery.

36:13.475 --> 36:17.144
You saw an opportunity
at the reserve and you took it.

36:17.178 --> 36:19.747
If I was your age,
I would've done the same thing.

36:19.781 --> 36:21.860
Well, then why are you being
so hard on me?

36:21.880 --> 36:25.618
I'm not being hard on you.
I'm pushing you.

36:25.653 --> 36:28.721
That's the only way you're
gonna be a great vet one day.

36:28.756 --> 36:31.271
From now on, I'm just gonna
throw you in the deep end,

36:31.291 --> 36:32.996
see if you can swim.

36:33.016 --> 36:34.895
Today you swam.

36:50.087 --> 36:52.412
Hey, stranger.

36:53.115 --> 36:54.213
Hey.

36:54.247 --> 36:56.561
I've been meaning
to ask you something.

36:56.921 --> 36:58.951
What?

36:58.985 --> 37:01.486
You brought Casey to dinner,
to meet the family.

37:01.521 --> 37:04.602
Does that mean it's serious?

37:06.551 --> 37:08.894
Actually, honey, I've...

37:08.929 --> 37:11.297
I'm not sure
it's gonna work out.

37:11.331 --> 37:16.119
Oh... that's too bad.
I'm... I'm sorry.

37:17.753 --> 37:19.800
Lou told me about you and Ty.

37:21.841 --> 37:23.574
Amy, I don't wanna
give you advice.

37:23.608 --> 37:26.650
God knows I'm hardly qualified...

37:27.556 --> 37:29.547
but... I'd like you
to promise me...

37:29.581 --> 37:32.183
that if you can't see your
future without somebody in it...

37:32.218 --> 37:36.313
whether that's Ty
or somebody else...

37:36.574 --> 37:38.789
you'll fight.

37:38.824 --> 37:42.360
You're strong.
You get that from your mother.

37:42.394 --> 37:47.044
So promise me...
fight for what's important.

37:48.322 --> 37:50.033
I promise.

37:50.068 --> 37:52.733
I love you.
I love you.

37:52.753 --> 37:54.813
Love you too, dad.

38:02.146 --> 38:06.090
I was looking at wedding rings today.

38:06.438 --> 38:09.389
- You were?
- No.

38:09.423 --> 38:11.071
That's mean!

38:11.091 --> 38:13.993
Do you really want me
to wear a ring?

38:14.028 --> 38:16.469
No, no... of course not.

38:16.489 --> 38:18.249
Do you really want me
to change my name?

38:18.269 --> 38:20.966
No, I don't.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.901
So you weren't upset
the other day?

38:22.936 --> 38:28.455
No. Maybe. Well,
just for a split second,

38:28.475 --> 38:30.543
and only because
you mentioned Dan.

38:30.577 --> 38:33.564
What does Dan have to do
with this?

38:34.981 --> 38:37.361
I don't know.

38:37.381 --> 38:39.684
You didn't change your name
for him.

38:39.719 --> 38:42.487
Well, I guess part of me
thought that you...

38:42.521 --> 38:44.089
might wanna change it for me...

38:44.124 --> 38:45.824
and not because
I expected you to,

38:45.859 --> 38:49.404
but... ju... just because...

38:50.596 --> 38:53.732
it's you and me and...

38:53.766 --> 38:57.402
we're somehow stronger
as a couple and...

38:57.436 --> 39:00.138
I know, that sounds crazy.

39:00.172 --> 39:05.124
No. But only because there's
no comparison to Dan.

39:05.144 --> 39:08.679
And I just... we don't need
to change our names and...

39:08.713 --> 39:11.649
put on wedding rings
to bind us together.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.685
We have more than that.

39:14.719 --> 39:17.021
So I'm always gonna be
Lisa Stillman,

39:17.055 --> 39:18.990
your loving wife.

39:19.024 --> 39:22.158
Yes.

39:22.704 --> 39:29.878
My loving, smart,
incredibly beautiful wife...

39:29.898 --> 39:31.602
Oh, yes.

39:36.583 --> 39:39.363
- Hi, Georgie!
- Hey!

39:39.383 --> 39:43.479
I just wanted to tell you that my
dad's keeping Lucas and Alexander.

39:43.514 --> 39:46.248
That's awesome!
What about your brother?

39:46.268 --> 39:48.318
Paul's been put in charge
of keeping all the farm equipment

39:48.352 --> 39:49.820
up and running at the colony,

39:49.854 --> 39:52.229
so he's like a pig in mud.

39:52.249 --> 39:54.557
And as long as I get all
of my weeding and picking done,

39:54.591 --> 39:56.592
I can visit the horses
whenever I want.

39:56.627 --> 39:58.695
I'm so happy for you, Hanna.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.619
What're you doing right now?

40:00.639 --> 40:03.466
Well, I was gonna go
ride Phoenix. Wanna come?

40:03.500 --> 40:05.234
I have a better idea.

40:07.938 --> 40:10.807
Come on, Lucas! Alexander!

40:15.678 --> 40:17.679
Come on, Lucas!
Come on, Alexander!

40:21.284 --> 40:23.636
Woo!

40:28.458 --> 40:30.692
Easy, boy, easy.

40:34.764 --> 40:38.467
Go on! Giddy up!
Alexander, Lucas, giddy up!

40:39.836 --> 40:42.437
Come on! Giddy up!

40:42.472 --> 40:45.698
Woo!

41:12.379 --> 41:14.835
Hey, Amy.
I, uh, just missed your call.

41:14.870 --> 41:16.946
I hope everything's okay.

41:21.109 --> 41:23.210
I know this might sound
kinda weird, but uh...

41:23.244 --> 41:26.646
I actually had my hand inside
a cow's abdomen today

41:26.680 --> 41:31.084
and it was...
it was sort of incredible.

41:31.119 --> 41:33.453
Anyways, I just wanted
to share that with you.

41:33.487 --> 41:35.514
Okay.

- Hey.

I just called you back.

41:50.971 --> 41:53.639
I'm sorry, I... I called, but...

41:53.673 --> 41:56.275
then I thought I'd just drop by.

41:56.310 --> 41:58.577
I just left you a message.

41:58.611 --> 42:01.213
Should I...
Should I listen to it?

42:32.445 --> 42:33.644

You've got no legal right
to keep her away from me.
