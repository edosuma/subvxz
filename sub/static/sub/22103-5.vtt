39:21.054 --> 39:23.883
-OR MAYBE HANNIBAL LECTER,
YOU KNOW? ONE OR THE OTHER.

39:24.013 --> 39:24.840
OR MAYBE BRUCE.

39:24.971 --> 39:25.972
-BRUCE WHO?

39:26.102 --> 39:27.800
-YOU KNOW, THE SHARK FROM JAWS.

39:27.930 --> 39:28.844
OR MAYBE CUJO.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.716
-SHUT UP.

39:30.846 --> 39:34.154
-OR MAYBE BENJI, OR DID YOU
SEE THAT MOVIE FREE WILLY?

39:37.636 --> 39:38.941
-HEY, FRIEND.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.423
-YOU KNOW MAYBE IF YOUR PARENT
HAD DONE THAT TO YOU

39:42.554 --> 39:44.294
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG,
YOU WOULDN'T BE SO OBNOXIOUS.

39:44.425 --> 39:46.035
I DON'T WANT TO BE
YOUR FRIEND SIMON.

39:46.166 --> 39:47.820
I DON'T WANT TO EVER SEE
YOU OR HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN.

39:47.950 --> 39:49.604
YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN
THOSE GUYS KILLED.

39:59.658 --> 40:01.703
-WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU TWO DOING?

40:01.834 --> 40:04.053
-LOOK, SUMMER, WE KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH IS DIFFICULT.

40:04.184 --> 40:06.012
-YEAH, WE DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE.

40:06.142 --> 40:07.840
-YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BOTHER.

40:07.970 --> 40:09.319
-WHY?

40:09.450 --> 40:11.496
-BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY
MADE MY CHOICE.

40:14.020 --> 40:15.935
I WANT YOU BOTH AS FRIENDS.

40:16.065 --> 40:19.852
WE ALL CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT
EACH OTHER TO LET THIS RUIN IT.

40:21.897 --> 40:23.290
OKAY?

40:24.813 --> 40:25.988
-OKAY.

40:27.468 --> 40:30.297
-I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
GUYS ACTUALLY JUMPED
OUT OF A BALLOON.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.733
-ME NEITHER.

40:37.478 --> 40:38.871
-BEAUTIFUL.
-WHAT'S THAT?

40:39.001 --> 40:41.526
-THAT IS A RAIL
FOR GARNER'S HORSE.

40:41.656 --> 40:42.744
WHAT'S THAT?

40:42.875 --> 40:44.224
-OH, I GOT THESE FOR KOJAK.

40:44.354 --> 40:45.704
THEY'RE BETTER FOR HIM
THAN TOOTSIE ROLL POPS.

40:45.834 --> 40:48.315
-DON'T GET THOSE
TOO CLOSE TO GARNER.

40:50.622 --> 40:51.623
LOOKS GOOD HUH?

40:53.407 --> 40:54.887
-HEY.
-OH NO.

40:55.017 --> 40:56.628
-OH NO, WHAT'S THIS?

40:56.758 --> 40:58.499
-WHERE'S KOJAK?

40:58.630 --> 41:01.894
-KOJAK IS BACK IN THE BARN,
AND I'M BACK RIDING THIS THING.

41:02.938 --> 41:04.549
-WHAT HAPPENED?

41:04.679 --> 41:07.160
-WELL, I WROTE UP MY REPORT,
AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS

41:07.290 --> 41:09.945
MY CAPTAIN DECIDED THAT
I DIDN'T DEMONSTRATE

41:10.076 --> 41:12.339
CONTEMPORARY POLICE DECORUM.

41:13.645 --> 41:15.298
-WHAT HAPPENED TO BILL PICKETT?

41:16.038 --> 41:17.562
-I TOLD HIM ABOUT BILL PICKETT.

41:17.692 --> 41:19.477
-WHAT ABOUT CLEANING UP
THE BEACH LIKE WYATT EARP?

41:20.652 --> 41:22.044
-HE SAID IF
I WANTED TO BE A COWBOY

41:22.175 --> 41:23.959
I SHOULD JOIN THE RODEO.

41:24.090 --> 41:25.308
-WELL, WHAT'D YOU TELL HIM?

41:25.439 --> 41:27.789
-NOTHING, I JUST BEGGED.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.270
[LAUGHTER]

41:32.968 --> 41:34.927
[ENDING THEME MUSIC]
