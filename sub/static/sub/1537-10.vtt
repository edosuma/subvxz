00:00.986 --> 00:04.455
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!

00:04.456 --> 00:06.657
Whoa, thank you, good sir!

00:06.658 --> 00:09.460
The elves will not starve
this night.

00:09.461 --> 00:11.061
- Any sign of our bogie?
<i>-  Negative.</i>

00:11.096 --> 00:12.496
Are you sure
our guy's gonna show?

00:12.497 --> 00:14.064
My C.I. said he walked
this route exactly

00:14.065 --> 00:15.332
the last three days.

00:15.367 --> 00:17.434
Fine, but in ten minutes,
we're calling this.

00:17.435 --> 00:19.203
I have to get back
to my ecstasy task force.

00:19.204 --> 00:20.804
We have to bag
a major giggle pig player soon,

00:20.805 --> 00:21.772
or they're gonna shut us down.

00:21.806 --> 00:24.808
Ho, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum.

00:24.809 --> 00:25.976
Presents!

00:25.977 --> 00:27.344
<i>God, you're bad at being Santa.</i>

00:27.379 --> 00:30.080
Jake, holy crap, 9:00.

00:30.081 --> 00:33.017
<i>The Pontiac bandit,
aka Doug Judy.</i>

00:33.051 --> 00:36.320
Okay, Santa, stay calm,
just like we practiced.

00:36.321 --> 00:40.057
Merry Judy,
Mr. Doug Judy Christmas.

00:40.058 --> 00:41.625
Damn it!
Peralta?

00:41.660 --> 00:42.793
No!

00:42.827 --> 00:43.827
Onion ring attack!

00:43.862 --> 00:46.630
Ah! Greasy!

00:46.631 --> 00:48.365
NYPD!
Stop where you are!

00:48.366 --> 00:50.801
Come on, Santa.
Why are you so fat?

00:59.177 --> 01:00.544
NYPD.
Clear out.

01:00.579 --> 01:02.646
Where are you?

01:02.647 --> 01:04.815
Ah!
Ah! Got you!

01:12.524 --> 01:15.059
Doug Judy, you're under arrest.

01:15.093 --> 01:16.093
Put your hands in the air.

01:16.094 --> 01:18.629
Hey, Rosa.
Merry Christmas, girl.

01:18.663 --> 01:19.964
Shut up.

01:19.965 --> 01:21.298
<i>Take a good look, kids.</i>

01:21.333 --> 01:24.368
This is what happens

Attention, everyone.

01:46.258 --> 01:47.858
<i>Holidays of many cultures
approach.</i>

01:47.892 --> 01:50.194
This truly is a joyful time.

01:50.195 --> 01:52.296
Join me
for a festive winter party

01:52.297 --> 01:54.365
at Shaw's bar this friday,
7:00 till 9:00.

01:54.366 --> 01:55.365
Any questions?

01:55.367 --> 01:56.400
A.M. or P.M.?

01:56.401 --> 01:58.035
I'm gonna let you
figure that one out.

01:58.036 --> 02:02.106
Also, I'd like to reiterate
None allowed.

02:02.140 --> 02:03.574
Enjoy this merry season.

02:03.608 --> 02:07.177
Good people of the nine-nine,
I present to you

02:07.212 --> 02:09.346
the seventh wonder of the world,

02:09.347 --> 02:13.584
Doug Judy, aka the Pontiac
bandit, foiled at last!

02:15.120 --> 02:16.387
All right!

02:16.421 --> 02:18.856
Wow, you guys,
thank you very much.

02:18.890 --> 02:19.990
All right, that's enough, Judy.

02:19.991 --> 02:21.992
This is my moment.
You are not to enjoy it.

02:21.993 --> 02:23.527
I can't help it.
I'm proud of you.

02:23.562 --> 02:24.862
You're like a son to me.

02:24.863 --> 02:26.363
A white, crispy son.

02:26.398 --> 02:28.098
How would that even work?
Am I adopted?

02:28.133 --> 02:30.534
No, your mother's
just really pale.

02:30.535 --> 02:31.535
Almost invisible.

02:31.536 --> 02:32.870
Okay.

02:32.871 --> 02:34.371
Anyways, it's a shame
I gotta ruin celebration

02:34.372 --> 02:36.307
by cutting a deal
and getting out of here.

02:36.308 --> 02:37.508
Never!
Right?

02:37.509 --> 02:41.812
I'm just saying, I know a lot
of real high-profile felons.

02:41.846 --> 02:44.882
Makes me
a very desirable tattletale.

02:44.916 --> 02:46.784
We will never cut
a deal with you,

02:46.785 --> 02:48.218
not after you screwed us
last year.

02:48.219 --> 02:51.188
You don't want any info on
a local burglary ring, perhaps?

02:51.222 --> 02:52.222
Not good enough.

02:52.223 --> 02:53.357
Testify, Captain!

02:53.358 --> 02:54.525
How about a guy
who makes fake credit cards?

02:54.559 --> 02:55.960
- Negative.
<i>-  You see that, Judy?</i>

02:55.994 --> 02:58.295
No matter what you say,
you're going to jail.

02:58.330 --> 02:59.697
What about drugs?

02:59.698 --> 03:03.500
Y'all ever heard of giggle pig?

03:03.501 --> 03:04.501
What do you know?

03:04.502 --> 03:05.669
We're listening.

03:05.670 --> 03:06.704
No, no, no, no, no,
we're not listening.

03:06.705 --> 03:07.705
We can't hear him.

03:07.706 --> 03:11.008
Everybody shoot your guns
in the air.

03:11.009 --> 03:13.277
Gina, you need to see this.

03:13.311 --> 03:14.545
Oh, Charles, I can't take that.

03:14.546 --> 03:16.447
It's clearly not cash,
and I don't have time

03:16.448 --> 03:18.349
in my life to return things.

03:18.383 --> 03:20.017
I found this at my dad's place
last night.

03:20.018 --> 03:21.185
It's from him to your mom.

03:21.219 --> 03:22.219
No!

03:22.254 --> 03:23.254
Yes!

03:23.255 --> 03:24.455
Boyle, this is bad.

03:24.489 --> 03:26.924
I thought our parents were
just having a casual fling,

03:26.925 --> 03:29.093
but presents is like
old people third base.

03:29.127 --> 03:30.494
No, that's rubbing butts
together.

03:30.528 --> 03:31.528
What?

03:31.529 --> 03:32.529
But this is very close.

03:32.530 --> 03:35.432
Gina, they may be
getting serious.

03:35.433 --> 03:36.634
Ugh!

03:36.635 --> 03:38.869
Don't you dare say that!

03:38.870 --> 03:41.672
Do you know how disgustingly
entangled our lives will be

03:41.673 --> 03:43.774
if our parents
turn into a real couple?

03:43.775 --> 03:45.276
Yes!
You think I want you

03:45.277 --> 03:48.045
and your mom horning in on
the Boyle boys mimosa brunches?

03:48.046 --> 03:49.079
That's our guy time.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.115
Ugh.
We need to figure out

03:51.116 --> 03:54.551
what is in this horrible
package, so we can determine

03:54.552 --> 03:56.153
where they're at
in their relationship.

03:57.255 --> 03:58.722
What if it's a romantic book

03:58.723 --> 04:01.425
or, like, a picture
of the two of them in a frame?

04:01.426 --> 04:03.460
Oh, or "his and hers" pajamas?

04:03.495 --> 04:05.296
The kind that dissolve
in your mouth.

04:05.330 --> 04:08.933
Ew, no!
No, Charles, ew.

04:10.368 --> 04:11.869
So this is
where all the tape went.

04:11.903 --> 04:14.872
I gotta put up this pictures
my daughters drew.

04:14.873 --> 04:16.572
And I need some
'cause I cut my hand.

04:16.608 --> 04:17.608
Hitchcock!

04:17.608 --> 04:18.909
Go to the hospital!

04:18.944 --> 04:20.344
And give 100 bucks
to some doctor

04:20.345 --> 04:22.212
to give me the exact same tape?

04:22.213 --> 04:23.647
I don't think so.

04:23.648 --> 04:26.116
Wow!
What's all this?

04:26.117 --> 04:28.052
I'm making a Christmas present
for Captain Holt.

04:28.053 --> 04:29.520
I know, I know.

04:29.521 --> 04:33.724
He has a strict "no gift"
policy, but I found a loophole.

04:33.725 --> 04:35.226
Like your loophole last year?

04:35.227 --> 04:38.429
So I was just gonna throw out
this brand-new squash racquet,

04:38.430 --> 04:41.131
but then I thought, "hey,
maybe the Captain could use it."

04:41.132 --> 04:42.132
I don't want your garbage.

04:42.133 --> 04:43.167
No, it was
a very expensive gift.

04:43.201 --> 04:46.670
Aha, suspicions confirmed.

04:46.671 --> 04:48.839
I asked the Captain
what qualified as a gift,

04:48.840 --> 04:51.308
and he said
anything I spent money on.

04:51.309 --> 04:54.678
Then I realized,
my time is worth nothing.

04:54.713 --> 04:57.781
Sounds like you're bragging,
but that's just a sad statement.

04:57.816 --> 05:00.150
I'm making a scrapbook
of his professional highlights.

05:00.151 --> 05:03.187
Newspaper clippings,
police reports, pictures.

05:03.221 --> 05:08.125
It's got every moment of his
career, "from Ray to Z."

05:08.159 --> 05:09.760
This is a very bad idea.

05:09.761 --> 05:12.363
I know, I'm not happy
with the title either,

05:12.364 --> 05:14.398
but my backup was
"keep holting on,"

05:14.399 --> 05:16.333
but that just makes him
sound like he's sick.

05:16.368 --> 05:19.737
All right, before we make
a deal with this evil monster,

05:19.738 --> 05:21.438
can I just ask something?

05:21.439 --> 05:23.340
Is giggle pig
really that important?

05:23.375 --> 05:26.644
My job, Rosa's job, and the fate
of this entire precinct

05:26.645 --> 05:28.812
all depend upon the outcome
of this task force.

05:28.847 --> 05:30.180
All right, fine.

05:30.181 --> 05:31.515
Diaz, what's our status
right now?

05:31.516 --> 05:32.483
<i>We've picked up
a bunch of dealers,</i>

05:32.517 --> 05:34.451
but our main target
is Tito Ruiz.

05:34.452 --> 05:35.686
We believe he runs
the whole operation,

05:35.687 --> 05:37.421
only we can't prove it
because none of his people

05:37.422 --> 05:38.421
<i>will turn on him</i>

05:38.423 --> 05:40.891
just because he bit off
a few noses.

05:40.892 --> 05:42.026
Babies.

05:42.027 --> 05:43.727
I say the only way we make
a deal with Doug Judy

05:43.762 --> 05:46.330
is if he can give us
the top guy, Tito Ruiz.

05:46.364 --> 05:47.798
I can give you Tito Ruiz.

05:47.832 --> 05:49.166
Oh, come on, Judy!

05:49.200 --> 05:50.834
I mean, how do we even know
this is real?

05:50.869 --> 05:52.136
This guy's a huckster!

05:52.137 --> 05:53.804
He's a lie guy.

05:53.805 --> 05:54.805
Peralta has a point.

05:54.839 --> 05:56.373
You have been a lie guy
to us before.

05:56.408 --> 05:58.509
Thank you.
Give me some details.

05:58.543 --> 06:00.411
Ruiz and I were cellies
in Attica in the '90s.

06:00.445 --> 06:01.612
He texted me last week.

06:01.646 --> 06:03.847
Needs some cars
to deliver his product.

06:03.848 --> 06:07.585
I said no
because drugs are stupid.

06:07.586 --> 06:09.086
Except for weed and sex pills.

06:09.087 --> 06:11.121
A man has needs.

06:11.156 --> 06:15.793
♪ Rosa, Rosa, Rosa, Rosa ♪

06:15.794 --> 06:18.495
♪ I can't think

06:18.530 --> 06:20.631
Enough crooning!

06:20.632 --> 06:22.533
Can you get us a face-to-face
with Ruiz?

06:22.567 --> 06:25.236
Yeah, but you gotta give me
zero jail time.

06:25.237 --> 06:26.203
No, that's not gonna happen.

06:26.238 --> 06:27.838
Ha-ha!
Stupid Judy.

06:27.872 --> 06:30.307
The D.A., however, will offer
a reduced sentence

06:30.308 --> 06:31.775
in return for Ruiz's arrest.

06:31.776 --> 06:33.344
5 years instead of 20.

06:33.378 --> 06:36.113
<i>Oh, that's tough</i>
but fair.

06:36.114 --> 06:38.382
I can see why you have such
intense daddy-stuff with him.

06:38.383 --> 06:40.217
Oh, yeah,
the guy without a daddy

06:40.218 --> 06:41.518
is the one with daddy issues.

06:41.519 --> 06:43.053
Explain that logic.

06:43.054 --> 06:45.256
Since I'm going to jail,
I wanna enjoy my time left

06:45.257 --> 06:47.057
on the outside.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.727
Put me up in a five-star hotel
like the Royce.

06:49.728 --> 06:51.529
Unlimited room service
and minibar privileges.

06:51.563 --> 06:54.131
Three-star hotel
like the Brooklyner.

06:54.132 --> 06:56.200
$60 a day meal allowance.
No minibar.

06:56.234 --> 06:58.569
<i>Four-star hotel like the Oneida.</i>

06:58.603 --> 07:01.205
200 in food,
no minibar or alcohol,

07:01.206 --> 07:03.507
but I get to go crazy
on candy and nuts.

07:03.541 --> 07:04.541
Agreed.

07:04.542 --> 07:06.710
Ow!
Oh, one last thing.

07:06.711 --> 07:09.480
Diaz has to be nice to me.

07:09.481 --> 07:12.316
I want her to call me big sugar.

07:12.350 --> 07:13.450
Ha, hugh mistake, bud.

07:13.451 --> 07:14.752
She'll never agree to that.

07:14.753 --> 07:17.288
No, I'm in.
Let's do this, big sugar.

07:17.289 --> 07:18.355
Ah!

07:18.356 --> 07:19.523
<i>What? All right, fine.</i>

07:19.524 --> 07:21.325
If this is going down,
I wanna be on this case,

07:21.326 --> 07:23.160
and my sole focus is Doug Judy.

07:23.161 --> 07:25.062
He never leaves my sights.

07:25.063 --> 07:27.064
Love it!
Pontiac bandit and Jake.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.333
Okay, okay.

07:47.367 --> 07:50.202
Okay, flat screen TV.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.570
King-sized bed.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.505
Hangers you can take
off the rod?

07:53.506 --> 07:56.408
This is what's up.
This place is nice.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.977
We should settle down here,
Rosa.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.912
Now if y'all excuse me,
I'ma go freshen up.

07:59.946 --> 08:02.014
I'm feeling stanky.

08:02.048 --> 08:04.249
Hold it!
Not so fast.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.151
What?

08:06.152 --> 08:07.152
Let's make out.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.988
Not yet.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.123
All right, there's no windows.
You can go in.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.492
But leave the door open,
and I'm hanging on to this.

08:13.526 --> 08:14.760
What in the world would I do
with that?

08:14.761 --> 08:16.562
Point it at my face
until my eyeballs dry out

08:16.563 --> 08:17.963
and I lose my sense of sight.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.698
Then shove it in my mouth,
so I can't yell for help,

08:19.699 --> 08:22.101
and finally run out the front
door and disappear forever.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.169
Nah, I was just gonna use it
to dry my undercarriage later.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.971
Ugh.
Would you just relax, okay?

08:25.972 --> 08:27.306
Stop being so paranoid.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.574
I'm playing ball.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.242
I got you.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.845
If you'll excuse me...

08:32.846 --> 08:34.212
All right, we can't be
too careful.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.381
Let's go over the plan
one more time.

08:35.381 --> 08:37.116
Doug Judy texts Ruiz
to set up a meet.

08:37.116 --> 08:39.018
We each have a hidden wire,
and we record Ruiz

08:39.019 --> 08:40.818
talking about giggle pig,
then take him down.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.388
<i>Tac team is on call
for backup...</i>

08:42.389 --> 08:44.222
What are you doing?
You look like a pervert.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.491
Putting a GPS tracker
in his shoe.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.393
He is not getting away
from me again,

08:47.394 --> 08:48.961
even if it means
putting my favorite hand

08:48.962 --> 08:50.863
into his rotten stink-boot.

08:50.864 --> 08:51.864
Okay.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.300
<i>Hoo-hoo!
Did you see the menu?</i>

08:54.334 --> 08:56.969
Lobster thermidor.
Baked Alaska.

08:57.003 --> 08:59.171
It's so fancy,
it don't even sound like food.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.973
Here, come on.
Order something.

09:01.007 --> 09:02.241
Order it. Do it.
Order it.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.709
No, thanks.
I'm on duty.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.044
Come on, Peralta.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.513
You gonna let the criminal
have all the fun?

09:07.514 --> 09:09.181
All right, fine.

09:09.182 --> 09:13.852
I'll have one lobster thermidor,
extra thermidor on the side.

09:13.853 --> 09:15.287
I have no idea
what I'm ordering.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.523
Me neither.
We're like culinary magellans.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.191
You know how we take this
to the next level?

09:19.192 --> 09:20.192
Robes!

09:20.193 --> 09:21.360
Robes!

09:22.395 --> 09:23.762
♪ Reunited ♪

09:23.797 --> 09:27.766
♪ And it feels so good ♪

09:27.801 --> 09:30.536
♪ Reunited ♪

09:30.537 --> 09:34.073
Okay, we just unwrap it,
we see what's inside,

09:34.074 --> 09:35.241
then we perfectly rewrap it.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.408
Our parents never know
what happened.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.311
Ugh, lord,
you're starting to sweat.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.247
You're gonna blemish
the wrapping paper.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.648
You're dabbing me really hard.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.316
You know what?
This is taking too long.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.852
Just scooch, you pooch.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.757
You are amazing.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.225
How did you do that?

09:53.260 --> 09:54.593
I always open my gifts
in advance,

09:54.594 --> 09:56.395
so I can rehearse my reactions

09:56.396 --> 09:58.564
and nail
those Christmas-morning candids.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.932
Check it out.

09:59.966 --> 10:01.900
Be-wonderment.

10:01.901 --> 10:05.437
Disbe-loving it.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.606
Sparkle-surprise.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.475
I like that.
Now focus up.

10:09.476 --> 10:12.645
Your dad got my mom...

10:12.646 --> 10:15.247
<i>A digital scale?
That's bad.</i>

10:15.282 --> 10:17.616
So bad, so wonderfully bad.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.785
Your dad might as well
have circled all the parts

10:19.786 --> 10:21.654
of my mom's body he didn't like
with a marker.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.155
You did that to me.

10:23.189 --> 10:24.290
And it didn't help at all.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.291
Nope.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.459
My mom is gonna hate this gift.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.862
And she'd hate it even more
if we were both there

10:29.896 --> 10:30.996
when she opened it.

10:30.997 --> 10:33.165
Should we do
a gift exchange dinner tonight

10:33.166 --> 10:34.166
with both our parents?

10:34.167 --> 10:35.167
Great idea.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.168
Maybe she'll slap him
in the face

10:36.169 --> 10:37.336
and never talk to him again.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.740
Sparkle-surprise, for real!

10:41.741 --> 10:44.176
Three lobster thermidors,
spaghetti and meatballs,

10:44.210 --> 10:46.130
Caesar salad with tater tots
instead of croutons.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.746
Oh, that's me.
Salad.

10:47.747 --> 10:48.981
I'm trying to eat healthy.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.950
I hear that.
Your body is a temple.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.952
All right, I'm searching it.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.420
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:54.421 --> 10:55.854
Peralta, what you doing,

10:55.855 --> 10:57.523
putting your fingers
in my fancy feast?

10:57.524 --> 10:58.591
What?

10:58.592 --> 11:00.159
How am I supposed to escape
using a lobster?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.594
Squeeze the lemon in my eyes,
so I can't see,

11:01.595 --> 11:02.895
stab me in the jugular
with a claw,

11:02.896 --> 11:04.029
and then shove the tail
down my throat,

11:04.030 --> 11:05.030
so I can't scream for help.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.032
I gotta keep my eye on you,
Judy.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.167
You're a slippery guy.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.568
Fair enough.
That I am.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.770
But for right now,
I'm all about helping you.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.273
So why don't you just chill
and eat some sexy-ass lobster?

11:14.307 --> 11:16.308
Okay, we held up our end
of the bargain.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.943
Text Ruiz now, friend.

11:17.944 --> 11:18.944
Fine.

11:20.947 --> 11:21.947
Tito, dot, dot, dot.

11:21.948 --> 11:22.948
You around, question mark.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.684
Wanna meet up, period.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.720
Speech to text,
we live in a magical age.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.421
It's like <i> The Jetsons.</i>

11:29.456 --> 11:31.690
By the way, this Tito dude,
he spooks real easy, so...

11:31.725 --> 11:33.058
No, there's no way
you're going in alone.

11:33.059 --> 11:34.226
We're coming with you.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.362
I've already got my cover story
worked out.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.130
My name is Dante Thunderstone.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.900
I stole my first car
at the tender age of nine.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.067
You had to fend for yourself

11:42.068 --> 11:43.402
since your mother was struck
by lightning.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.037
While she was pregnant with me.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.272
She passed.
I lived.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.073
Some say that makes Zeus my dad.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.108
Oh!

11:49.109 --> 11:50.109
Mythic.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.110
That's dope.

11:51.111 --> 11:55.381
And, Rosa,
you could be my wife...

11:55.382 --> 11:56.782
Rosa.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.851
Why would you take your wife
with you to meet a drug dealer?

11:58.885 --> 12:00.419
'Cause we're partners
in everything we do.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.453
Aw.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.690
Whoa.
Tito wants to meet up.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.225
Great, tell him to meet us
over here.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.426
We'll get him a lobster
and a robe.

12:07.460 --> 12:12.097
I mean no,
let's go catch him in the act.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.935
Sarge, I'm freaking out
about my gift

12:15.936 --> 12:17.136
that's not technically a gift.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.238
Somehow, that doesn't
surprise me.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.674
Something horrible has happened,
and I don't know what to do.

12:21.675 --> 12:24.243
Has Captain Holt ever told you
about the Brooklyn broiler?

12:24.277 --> 12:26.211
Yeah. Arsonist.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.948
Burned down 12 buildings
in crown heights.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.950
Captain's told me
about it many times.

12:31.952 --> 12:35.621
You flamed out.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.089
Dirt bag.

12:37.123 --> 12:40.526
Well, I think Captain
may have made a... mistake.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.628
What are you talking about?

12:42.662 --> 12:44.163
I was doing follow-up research
on the case

12:44.164 --> 12:46.265
for a fun "where are they now?"
Section,

12:46.266 --> 12:48.000
and I don't think the broiler
set three of the fires

12:48.001 --> 12:49.000
he was charged with.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.803
I gotta tell the Captain.

12:50.837 --> 12:52.071
Do you think he'll be upset?

12:52.105 --> 12:53.372
Probably not.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.307
I mean, he seems like
the kind of laid-back guy

12:55.308 --> 12:57.242
who delights in having
his mistakes exposed.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.312
Maybe next year
you can do a collage

13:00.313 --> 13:02.047
about low points
in his marriage.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.983
I know you're being sarcastic,
sarge,

13:03.984 --> 13:07.052
but I really do love
making collages.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.755
Ruiz's bodyguards.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.792
Prepare to be touched
in some real intimate places.

13:13.827 --> 13:14.826
I'm clean.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.061
Watch it.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.364
Where did you get those shoes,
man?

13:18.365 --> 13:20.099
<i>There he is.</i>

13:20.133 --> 13:21.433
Tito, what's up, my man?

13:21.434 --> 13:23.969
Doug Judy.
Who are they?

13:24.004 --> 13:25.738
That's my bodyguard, Selena.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.473
We're doing it on the D.L.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.341
He's an amazing lover.
I'm pregnant.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.844
Oh, nice!

13:31.845 --> 13:34.813
And this here is my partner,
Dante Thunderstone.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.048
The one and only.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.517
Brrrat, brrrat, brrrat!

13:38.518 --> 13:39.685
<i>Okay, Judy.</i>

13:39.719 --> 13:41.287
If we're gonna do business,
I gotta see how good

13:41.288 --> 13:42.288
you really are.

13:42.289 --> 13:43.522
<i>This is a test.</i>

13:43.556 --> 13:44.990
Go Jack that car right now.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.525
<i>Give him the tools.</i>

13:49.162 --> 13:50.162
No worries.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.866
That is a cinch to pinch.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.935
There's no way you're getting
in that car alone.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.337
Hey, where are you going,
Thunderstone?

13:58.338 --> 13:59.337
<i>To steal the car.</i>

13:59.339 --> 14:02.383
I Jack the rides.
Judy holds my tools.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.009
Fine.
Then you have two minutes.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.377
Only need one.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.179
That was tight.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.681
You played him like a boss.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.516
Thanks. Now I just need
to magically learn

14:10.517 --> 14:11.884
how to steal a car.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.519
Braat, braat!

14:16.344 --> 14:17.978
Okay, okay, all I have to do
is break into this car

14:17.979 --> 14:19.013
and drive it away without a key.

14:19.047 --> 14:20.314
Something wrong?

14:20.315 --> 14:23.117
Nope, just, uh,
warming up my stealing fingies.

14:23.118 --> 14:24.118
Relax, Thunderstone.

14:24.119 --> 14:26.687
It's easy.
Here.

14:26.721 --> 14:27.755
What are you talking about?

14:27.756 --> 14:29.290
Oh, just, uh,
telling Thunderstone

14:29.291 --> 14:30.591
how I move it
on the dance floor.

14:30.625 --> 14:33.127
Always start
with a side-to-side sway.

14:33.128 --> 14:35.429
Real smooth, real slow.

14:35.463 --> 14:36.931
Real smooth and real slow.

14:36.932 --> 14:38.933
Yeah, and when I feel
that groove, I pop it!

14:38.934 --> 14:40.534
Yeah.

14:40.569 --> 14:43.270
And I pull it, pull it back.
Pull it back hard.

14:43.305 --> 14:45.372
Whoo! Ha-ha!
Yeah.

14:45.407 --> 14:48.409
Yes, I love the way you dance,
Doug Judy.

14:48.410 --> 14:51.412
All right, this next part
is like french kissing.

14:51.413 --> 14:52.546
Got it.

14:52.581 --> 14:54.615
Jam it in there
and move it around wildly.

14:54.649 --> 14:58.052
I gotta ask, Peralta, do
the ladies enjoy that technique?

14:58.086 --> 14:59.553
Ten seconds.

14:59.588 --> 15:00.754
Come on.

15:03.391 --> 15:04.592
Ah, yes!

15:05.794 --> 15:08.229
Okay, let's go.

15:09.698 --> 15:11.632
Thank you, Charles, Regina,

15:11.666 --> 15:13.634
<i>for inviting us
on this double date.</i>

15:13.635 --> 15:17.071
Kind of like
a fun Christmas four-way, right?

15:17.105 --> 15:18.305
Well put, Lynn.
Yeah.

15:18.340 --> 15:20.040
<i>A very sweet sentiment.</i>

15:20.041 --> 15:21.876
Oh, my God!
I have an idea.

15:21.877 --> 15:22.877
Let's open presents.

15:22.878 --> 15:23.878
Okay.
Oh.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.246
I wanna see what everyone
got everyone

15:25.280 --> 15:27.715
and how everyone reacts poorly.

15:27.716 --> 15:29.483
Fun, fun.
I just hope you like it.

15:29.484 --> 15:30.584
I don't know.

15:33.455 --> 15:35.656
A digital scale?

15:35.657 --> 15:39.193
Lynn Boyle,
you're a horrible, horrible man.

15:39.194 --> 15:40.594
You went
way over our price limit.

15:40.595 --> 15:41.595
Yes, I did.

15:41.596 --> 15:42.897
And I love it!
Yay!

15:42.898 --> 15:45.566
<i>It's gonna go so great
in the guest bathroom.</i>

15:45.567 --> 15:46.800
What?

15:46.801 --> 15:47.768
Lynn and I are moving in
together.

15:47.802 --> 15:49.169
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

15:49.170 --> 15:50.371
<i>And the rent's a little steep,
so we promised</i>

15:50.372 --> 15:52.039
we would only exchange
small gifts.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.173
Mm-hmm.

15:53.174 --> 15:54.408
But you had to push it,
didn't you?

15:54.409 --> 15:55.409
I did.

15:55.410 --> 15:56.977
You naughty boy.

15:57.012 --> 16:00.481
I had to get my pookums
a present, pookums.

16:00.482 --> 16:04.151
Okay, well, this is wonderful,

16:04.185 --> 16:07.688
but I am needed elsewhere,
so I'm gonna take off.

16:07.722 --> 16:11.158
Thank you so much.

16:11.192 --> 16:13.127
Nog, nog.

16:13.128 --> 16:15.062
Little Christmas humor.

16:15.063 --> 16:17.631
Yes, the "nog" from "egg nog,"
used in place of "knock."

16:17.632 --> 16:20.134
I stand corrected.
He loved it.

16:20.135 --> 16:22.503
So I was just looking
through some old files,

16:22.504 --> 16:25.206
and I think I may have found
a mistake in a closed case.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.273
Which one?

16:26.274 --> 16:29.043
It was actually...
Now that I think of it,

16:29.044 --> 16:30.444
if I'm remembering correctly,

16:30.445 --> 16:32.379
and I could be wrong on this,
but...

16:32.380 --> 16:33.447
It's the Brooklyn broiler.

16:33.448 --> 16:35.349
What? That dirtbag
flamed out ages ago.

16:35.350 --> 16:36.684
Why were you looking
at that case?

16:36.718 --> 16:38.552
She was making you a gift...

16:38.553 --> 16:40.120
Not a gift, snitch.

16:40.121 --> 16:43.824
It didn't cost me anything,
just my worthless man-hours.

16:43.825 --> 16:46.360
"From Ray to Z"?

16:46.361 --> 16:48.062
<i>I thought I told you no gifts.</i>

16:48.063 --> 16:49.863
Take this away,
and bring me the broiler's file.

16:49.864 --> 16:51.232
I'll look into this mistake.

16:51.266 --> 16:52.967
Actually, the evidence
is part of the scrapbook,

16:52.968 --> 16:54.201
so I have to leave
the whole thing.

16:54.236 --> 16:56.103
<i>Fine, I'll look
at the relevant pages,</i>

16:56.104 --> 17:00.874
but as for the rest,
I will not peruse.

17:03.011 --> 17:05.246
Wow, sweet setup.
What do you make here?

17:05.280 --> 17:06.946
Don't worry about it.

17:06.948 --> 17:08.616
Oh, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

17:08.650 --> 17:10.617
We need 20 cars a week.

17:10.618 --> 17:13.621
I want to use them each once,
then dump 'em.

17:13.622 --> 17:16.123
Oh, well,
you picked the right man.

17:16.124 --> 17:18.092
So are we gonna make a deal
or what?

17:18.093 --> 17:20.027
Or do I need to talk
to your boss?

17:20.028 --> 17:21.161
You can talk to me.

17:21.162 --> 17:22.863
So you're the boss?

17:22.897 --> 17:25.432
Yeah, I'm the boss,
and this is my place.

17:25.467 --> 17:26.901
And in my place, people know

17:26.902 --> 17:29.270
they shouldn't ask
dumb questions.

17:29.271 --> 17:31.171
Got it?

17:31.172 --> 17:32.171
Yeah, I got it.

17:32.173 --> 17:34.929
I tried to tell him, Tito.

17:34.943 --> 17:37.244
All right, let's talk deets.

17:39.514 --> 17:40.581
Is that us?

17:40.615 --> 17:42.116
No, we gotta go right now!
Go, go, go!

17:42.150 --> 17:44.118
<i>On the ground!
NYPD!</i>

17:44.119 --> 17:45.553
NYPD.
Nobody move!

17:47.255 --> 17:48.255
Diaz!

17:48.256 --> 17:49.323
Don't need help.
Behind you.

17:49.324 --> 17:51.466
Bye bye, Peralta.
Here's your GPS.

17:51.467 --> 17:52.792
No!

17:53.355 --> 17:54.388
<i>Let's go!</i>

17:54.389 --> 17:56.490
Ha-ha, I got you!

17:56.491 --> 17:59.560
Yeah, you did, but your boy
Tito's getting away.

18:02.464 --> 18:05.066
Damn it!
Damn you, Doug Judy!

18:08.570 --> 18:12.940
I'll never forget you,
Dante Thunderstone!

18:20.048 --> 18:22.249
You have the right to remain
Doug Judy.

18:22.250 --> 18:23.684
Anything you Doug
or Judy can be used

18:23.685 --> 18:26.020
against you in a Doug of Judy.

18:26.021 --> 18:29.390
Sorry, I'm preoccupied by someone
who will remain nameless.

18:29.391 --> 18:30.758
I'll start over.

18:32.994 --> 18:36.297
Santiago, I want to thank you
for my gift.

18:36.298 --> 18:38.299
You like the scrapbook?
I don't know.

18:38.333 --> 18:41.836
I'm a man of my word,
so I did not peruse.

18:41.837 --> 18:44.972
The gift I'm referring to
was you pointing out my mistake.

18:44.973 --> 18:47.141
Do you know why
I don't accept gifts?

18:47.175 --> 18:50.044
Because you're so evolved,
you don't need material things.

18:50.078 --> 18:51.312
Because I don't like
brown-nosing.

18:51.313 --> 18:52.312
Oh.

18:52.314 --> 18:54.148
Youch, that was hard to watch.

18:54.182 --> 18:55.649
You told me to my face
that I made a mistake,

18:55.650 --> 18:58.052
and that's as far from
brown-nosing as one can get.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.052
I respect you for that.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.094
Now I have a gift for you.

19:00.122 --> 19:02.490
I have the complete
Brooklyn broiler files.

19:02.524 --> 19:03.691
He was given
three life sentences,

19:03.692 --> 19:04.925
and it should have been two.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.095
So I've already contacted
the D.A. about the error.

19:08.096 --> 19:10.197
Will you please help me figure
out who set those other fires?

19:10.232 --> 19:13.734
Ooh! More work!

19:13.735 --> 19:15.136
I know that sounded
sarcastic, but...

19:15.170 --> 19:16.237
Nobody thought that.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.238
Not for a moment.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.640
Great.

19:23.311 --> 19:26.180
Chaz-ma-taz, how we doing, baby?

19:26.181 --> 19:27.815
I thought you'd be
in an awful mood.

19:27.849 --> 19:30.651
Why would be upset
when I've never had more purpose

19:30.652 --> 19:32.053
in my entire life?

19:32.087 --> 19:33.554
Are you gonna poison my dad?

19:33.555 --> 19:35.156
No, our parents say
they're in love,

19:35.190 --> 19:39.126
but we both know that's just
their old brains disintegrating.

19:39.161 --> 19:43.698
We need to break them up for
their sake, for our sake,

19:43.699 --> 19:46.767
for the sake
of this great nation.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.703
Agreed.

19:48.737 --> 19:52.540
Ew! I forgot how clammy
your hands are.

19:53.909 --> 19:57.011
Mood unaffected.
Mood unaffected.

19:57.045 --> 19:59.413
Attention please!
Attention.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.882
I'm sorry to interrupt
your holiday revelry.

20:01.883 --> 20:03.718
It truly is a fun night.

20:03.752 --> 20:06.487
I'd like to propose a toast
to Detective Diaz

20:06.488 --> 20:08.990
and her task force,
who successfully brought down

20:08.991 --> 20:11.759
Tito Ruiz and his entire
giggle pig network.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.794
Great work, everyone.
Drink up!

20:13.795 --> 20:15.663
Yeah!

20:18.367 --> 20:20.468
Hey, so I checked again.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.602
Doug Judy still hasn't surfaced.

20:21.636 --> 20:23.404
Yeah, he has.

20:23.405 --> 20:25.940
He just sent me this.

20:28.110 --> 20:29.276
What's up, Peralta?

20:29.277 --> 20:31.245
Greetings from paradise.

20:31.246 --> 20:33.647
Actually, I'm a little
disappointed in the hotel.

20:33.648 --> 20:34.815
How do you mess up an omelet?

20:34.816 --> 20:36.784
It's just a flat egg.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.285
He pretty much just talks
about the omelet

20:38.286 --> 20:40.688
for the next ten minutes, but...

20:40.722 --> 20:41.989
About my escape.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.792
This is my associate Kyle.

20:46.295 --> 20:47.595
He drove the garbage truck.

20:47.629 --> 20:50.298
You may also remember him
as the room service water

20:50.299 --> 20:52.300
I had you tip so generously.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.901
Son of a bitch.

20:53.902 --> 20:56.037
Yup, and when he ordered
the lobster,

20:56.038 --> 20:58.139
it was code for Kyle
to follow him.

20:58.140 --> 20:59.440
Anyway, tell Diaz she loves me.

20:59.441 --> 21:01.509
Merry Christmas!

21:01.510 --> 21:02.943
Hey, first things first.

21:02.944 --> 21:05.212
I swear to you
we are gonna catch Doug Judy.

21:05.213 --> 21:06.947
Yeah, I know.

21:06.948 --> 21:08.182
We did it once.
We can do it again.

21:08.216 --> 21:10.718
No. We will catch him.

21:10.719 --> 21:12.920
More importantly, thank you.

21:12.921 --> 21:14.255
I know how hard
that was to make that choice

21:14.256 --> 21:15.556
and let him get away.

21:15.557 --> 21:17.925
No, it was an easy call.

21:17.926 --> 21:19.927
I know how much this task force
means to you.

21:19.928 --> 21:21.395
It means so much,
and it's been so stressful,

21:21.396 --> 21:23.064
and it went so well.

21:23.065 --> 21:25.399
Seriously, look at me,
I cannot stop smiling.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.401
How do people do this
with their faces?
