00:05.070 --> 00:06.169
BARCELONA, 2003

00:06.190 --> 00:09.080
How do you imagine your life
in the future?

00:09.210 --> 00:11.199
I picture myself
living in Senegal.

00:12.050 --> 00:13.169
What are you on about!

00:13.189 --> 00:16.149
By 30, I want to have lived
in three different continents.

00:16.170 --> 00:18.160
No more than three years
in each country.

00:18.179 --> 00:20.030
What will you live off?

00:20.050 --> 00:23.120
I'll work for Architectes
Sans Frontières, something like
that.

00:23.140 --> 00:26.030
Building aqueducts,
homes for people...

00:26.050 --> 00:29.070
If you don't get your act
together,
you won't make the grade.

00:29.089 --> 00:32.140
I will...
Come on, how do you picture it?

00:33.159 --> 00:35.219
-Studying.
-Come on, Mery, I mean it.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.210
As a dental surgeon, you already
know.

00:37.229 --> 00:39.109
Give me more details.

00:39.130 --> 00:41.119
My own clinic, a big house, two
kids.

00:41.219 --> 00:45.149
-Kids don't interest me.
-I want two: Federico and
Carolina.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.229
-With Gus?
-Yeah.

00:47.149 --> 00:51.079
But I'll have more boyfriends at
college,
or I'll worry about only having
one love.

00:51.100 --> 00:52.189
So we'll split up for a while.

00:52.210 --> 00:54.079
We'll date again after uni,

00:54.100 --> 00:57.179
marry at around 28,
and have kids.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.200
But I must be a mother before
I'm 30.

01:00.100 --> 01:02.049
It's awful...

01:02.159 --> 01:05.109
One day we'll be 30-year-old
ladies.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.049
There's plenty of time until
then.

01:12.230 --> 01:15.079
15 YEARS LATER

01:30.060 --> 01:31.230
SIXTH MONTH

01:58.180 --> 02:02.120
PERFECT LIFE

02:02.140 --> 02:05.120
WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE.

02:19.069 --> 02:22.139
Place your hands
on the mothers' bellies.

02:24.030 --> 02:28.000
Now imagine that every wave
that brings your raft closer to
shore

02:28.020 --> 02:32.150
is actually bringing you closer
to the birth of your child.

02:46.039 --> 02:50.170
You push your perineum
towards the rectum and to the
sides.

02:51.039 --> 02:53.110
All right? Press down hard.

02:53.129 --> 02:55.050
-Is that my vagina?
-Yes.

02:55.069 --> 02:56.210
Imagine that it's your vagina.

02:56.229 --> 03:00.099
You must carry on pressing
until it hurts.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.090
Right? Then you release the
pressure.

03:02.180 --> 03:05.219
That way you reduce the risk of
tears.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.020
You can do it yourself,
but it's best if someone does it
for you.

03:10.159 --> 03:11.229
You can do it for her, Gari.

03:12.009 --> 03:13.050
-Me?
-Yes.

03:13.069 --> 03:14.060
No, not me.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.120
But why not?

03:15.139 --> 03:16.229
No, I can't see it happening.

03:17.009 --> 03:19.129
Well then, a female friend can
help you.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.020
Or a boyfriend.

03:22.159 --> 03:23.170
Right.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.150
Hey...

03:29.009 --> 03:30.060
It's really swollen.

03:30.079 --> 03:32.110
That's okay. It's normal.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.139
Go for it.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.129
Like that?

03:37.139 --> 03:38.150
There, there.

03:39.069 --> 03:41.030
-More?
-Yes, go on.

03:42.129 --> 03:44.110
-Why the face?
-Huh?

03:44.129 --> 03:45.099
Does it disgust you?

03:45.120 --> 03:47.020
No. It's not that.

03:47.039 --> 03:49.039
I'm afraid of hurting you.

03:50.079 --> 03:51.150
What if we screw?

04:00.159 --> 04:04.189
So what do you call
what you are or what you do?

04:04.210 --> 04:07.210
You say,
"Hi, I'm Xosé and I'm..."

04:07.229 --> 04:09.189
A social caregiver.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.060
Caregiver...

04:11.080 --> 04:12.150
Caregiver.

04:13.069 --> 04:15.150
Caregiver... Take care of me.

04:16.129 --> 04:18.220
How can I care for you, then?

04:19.230 --> 04:21.170
Tell me: what are you and I?

04:22.050 --> 04:23.139
In what way?

04:24.069 --> 04:27.100
The fact that we're both naked
in bed together?

04:28.139 --> 04:29.120
Lovers.

04:29.139 --> 04:30.089
Lovers...

04:30.110 --> 04:31.079
Lovers.

04:32.060 --> 04:36.029
Lovers sounds like people who
hide.

04:36.149 --> 04:40.050
All right, but we're hiding from
Gari.

04:41.139 --> 04:42.189
Or shall we tell him?

04:43.069 --> 04:44.009
No, no.

04:44.029 --> 04:45.029
Sure?

04:45.050 --> 04:47.009
-Absolutely sure.
-Okay.

04:47.029 --> 04:49.079
-Do you want to tell him?
-No, no.

04:51.170 --> 04:53.100
Look, I can have...

04:53.199 --> 04:57.110
I could have a partner if I
wanted,
I don't owe Gari explanations.

04:57.129 --> 04:58.180
Right.

04:59.029 --> 05:01.079
I don't mean that what we have
is something.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.180
No.

05:06.050 --> 05:08.079
So, what's the plan?

05:08.209 --> 05:10.069
I mean...

05:10.139 --> 05:13.129
The idea is to keep meeting
here...

05:14.060 --> 05:15.180
doing this...?

05:17.009 --> 05:22.019
Well, I think that the plan
is to keep on meeting...

05:23.019 --> 05:24.110
and see what happens.

05:25.079 --> 05:29.029
Because you've just got out
of a pretty long relationship.

05:29.170 --> 05:31.199
And I just got divorced.

05:31.220 --> 05:33.149
Well, it was a year ago, but...

05:35.000 --> 05:36.050
Bit by bit.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.120
Yes, yes.

05:41.110 --> 05:43.090
Bit by bit. Sure.

05:45.230 --> 05:48.110
I'm not asking you for anything.

05:48.129 --> 05:49.209
No, no.

05:50.060 --> 05:51.069
Okay.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.149
Do you want to sleep over?

05:59.139 --> 06:01.040
-No.
-No?

06:03.079 --> 06:04.100
All right...

06:04.120 --> 06:06.079
It's already quite late.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.199
I'd rather go back to my
sister's.

06:10.060 --> 06:11.100
Okay.

06:13.120 --> 06:16.100
Come on, shake your ass!

06:28.069 --> 06:30.019
Name me a street.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.209
5, Viladomat.

06:31.230 --> 06:33.149
-What's this?
-Write down "five".

06:33.170 --> 06:36.079
-Say a number, María. Quick.
-Hey. Quick, hurry up.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.159
-Without thinking.
-Now!

06:37.180 --> 06:39.060
-Eight.
-Eight, María.

06:39.079 --> 06:40.159
Brilliant! 8, Muntaner.

06:40.180 --> 06:44.000
-What are you doing?
-Giving away my paintings to
people.

06:44.019 --> 06:45.189
Random people in Barcelona.

06:45.209 --> 06:48.149
Ding, dong. We have a packet for
you.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.149
Are you taking drugs?

06:50.170 --> 06:53.090
This is my house, María,
and I can do what I want.

06:53.110 --> 06:55.069
If you don't like it, beat it.

06:59.079 --> 07:03.069
God, what my poor nephew Juanito
is gonna have to put up with.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.170
His name isn't Juanito!

07:04.189 --> 07:07.170
It's gonna be Juanito
even if he's incognito!

07:07.189 --> 07:09.000
Take that, it rhymes!

07:52.180 --> 07:55.100
Come on, Paula.
You can get dressed by yourself.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.100
-What?
-Come on.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.019
Morning.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.100
Morning.

07:59.209 --> 08:01.089
-It's for Martina.
-Huh?

08:01.110 --> 08:02.110
It's mine, Martina!

08:02.129 --> 08:03.189
Come on, kids.

08:04.079 --> 08:07.149
-What is it?
-Look what we have for you
today.

08:07.209 --> 08:10.089
Look what I've got for Martina.
Open up!

08:10.110 --> 08:12.089
Shall I eat it? Look, look.

08:12.110 --> 08:14.069
No, sweetheart.

08:15.009 --> 08:17.069
Sorry, sorry, we're in a hurry.

08:17.089 --> 08:18.230
-Give it to me!
-Stop that, Paula!

08:19.079 --> 08:21.089
First stop, Martina.

08:24.009 --> 08:25.139
Okay, Paula, we're here.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.009
This isn't the time for reading.
You know how to do this.

08:29.029 --> 08:30.199
Come on. Ouch, damn!

08:31.040 --> 08:33.190
Do you have the rucksack?

08:35.120 --> 08:37.009
Okay, I'll include it.

08:37.029 --> 08:39.080
-Is the client here?
-They're waiting for you.

08:41.070 --> 08:45.019
KITTYONHEAT84:
Got a 30-minute window at 4pm.

08:45.039 --> 08:46.220
Meet where we did the other day?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.070
SEXYDARKGUY:
Impossible. Tons of work.

08:52.090 --> 08:53.129
The subsidiary's contract.

08:53.149 --> 08:55.200
Do people not eat around here?

08:57.129 --> 09:00.029
-He's a real artist, but...
-I'll print it out again.

09:00.049 --> 09:02.220
You could do
with reducing your working
hours.

09:03.009 --> 09:04.210
It's not necessary, thanks.

09:04.230 --> 09:06.129
For your own sake.

09:09.039 --> 09:11.080
I'll be right there.
Okay, ciao.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.190
Thanks for staying with her.

09:15.210 --> 09:19.009
I'd like a word with Pablo and
you
next week.

09:19.029 --> 09:22.009
It's not right that Paula
has to wait here every day for
an hour.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.110
You're absolutely right,
but I was with a client.

09:24.129 --> 09:27.049
-But it's every day.
-I know, sorry. Thanks so much.

09:27.070 --> 09:30.049
We need yoghurts
and then we're almost done,
kids.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.129
-No, no. I want that one!
-No, sweetheart, no.

09:34.210 --> 09:36.139
Hello there.

09:36.159 --> 09:39.000
-Hi, honey.
-Daddy!

09:40.220 --> 09:42.159
-What's up?
-You're late, huh?

09:42.179 --> 09:44.029
Yeah.

09:44.049 --> 09:47.100
They insisted on going to have a
beer.

09:48.059 --> 09:50.029
I couldn't say no, darling.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.009
Come here.

09:52.190 --> 09:56.019
Do you mind if I lie down a bit
before clearing up?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.090
MARIA AND CRIS

10:08.019 --> 10:09.129
CLASS OF 2003

10:09.149 --> 10:11.080
That was at high school!

10:12.129 --> 10:13.190
So cute.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.129
The twins!

10:18.210 --> 10:20.049
Incredible.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.110
Hold it there, Pauli.

10:22.129 --> 10:23.139
SCHOOL REUNION

10:23.159 --> 10:24.200
I'm not going.

10:25.179 --> 10:28.120
Of course we are.
We'll celebrate our teenage
years.

10:28.139 --> 10:29.190
I can't drink alcohol.

10:29.210 --> 10:31.200
All right. Make a toast with
water.

10:31.220 --> 10:33.070
That's bad luck.

10:34.019 --> 10:36.009
-It's because of Gustavo, right?
-No.

10:36.149 --> 10:38.000
Sure it's not because of that
idiot?

10:38.019 --> 10:39.129
Tell her it's not because of
him.

10:39.149 --> 10:40.120
-No.
-See?

10:40.139 --> 10:42.210
By the way,
he knows that you're pregnant.

10:43.080 --> 10:46.009
What? How do you know he knows?

10:46.029 --> 10:48.110
Laura told me,
she met him at a wedding.

10:48.129 --> 10:49.100
Who's Laura?

10:49.120 --> 10:50.149
A friend of ours.

10:50.169 --> 10:53.070
Move forward a bit.
It's difficult this way.

10:53.090 --> 10:55.009
But did she tell him everything?

10:55.200 --> 10:57.070
I mean, about Gari as well?

10:57.090 --> 11:00.039
I don't think so,
she doesn't know about it.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.019
Well, whatever.

11:03.039 --> 11:05.009
I'm not going anyway.

11:05.029 --> 11:06.169
All right, suit yourself.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.159
Are you putting cream on your
boobs?

11:10.179 --> 11:11.139
No, not really.

11:11.159 --> 11:14.169
-You'll get stretch marks.
-I don't care if I do.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.100
What are stretch marks?

11:16.120 --> 11:18.059
You get them when your skin
cracks.

11:18.080 --> 11:21.100
No, it doesn't crack,
sweetheart.
It stretches.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.230
What are you like...

11:23.009 --> 11:24.169
Think Gustavo will go?

11:24.190 --> 11:27.000
I'll be right back,
stay here with Paula.

11:28.090 --> 11:31.200
Yes, I do. Going to the party
is just his kind of thing.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.000
I don't want to go to the
reunion.

11:39.129 --> 11:41.190
Do you have lice in your
titties?

11:41.210 --> 11:43.220
No, it's because of the baby.

11:45.129 --> 11:47.129
You've got a baby in your
titties?

11:48.090 --> 11:50.059
No, in my tummy.

11:54.230 --> 11:56.139
Will he be called Juanito?

11:58.049 --> 12:00.029
No, he won't be called that.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.080
What will he be called?

12:03.139 --> 12:05.029
I don't know.

12:09.169 --> 12:11.129
I don't know what he'll be
called.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.200
What's wrong?

12:21.139 --> 12:23.149
Here, sweetie, rosehip oil.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.129
What's wrong?

12:25.149 --> 12:28.139
I won't be able to handle it all
by myself.

12:28.159 --> 12:32.100
Look at me, darling.
Look at me, you're not alone.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.070
I'm here for you, okay?

12:34.159 --> 12:36.100
And you have Gari.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.039
-And this duck.
-You have this duck.

12:40.190 --> 12:42.039
And my fanny has grey hairs.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.019
You what?

12:44.039 --> 12:47.110
I saw them the other day
when I gave myself a perineal
massage.

12:47.129 --> 12:49.080
My fanny has grey hairs.

12:49.100 --> 12:53.169
You're overthinking everything.
It's over. You have to switch
off, okay?

12:58.100 --> 13:00.059
CLASS OF 2003

13:09.009 --> 13:11.000
Oh, she's so pretty!

13:12.120 --> 13:15.120
-What's this?
-I can't remember!

13:28.149 --> 13:31.159
FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF A TIME
THAT MARKED OUR LIVES

13:32.129 --> 13:34.120
COME AND CELEBRATE

13:35.230 --> 13:37.039
HOW WE'VE CHANGED

13:37.059 --> 13:40.169
Give it up for my sister,
who made this fantastic video.

13:40.190 --> 13:42.059
Bravo!

13:46.179 --> 13:52.129
Friends, it's an honor to be
part
of Santa María's class of 2003!

13:58.000 --> 14:00.159
-But you haven't changed a bit.
-Well, not exactly.

14:00.179 --> 14:02.100
Yes, you look exactly the same.

14:03.090 --> 14:05.080
-What about you guys?
-Fine.

14:05.100 --> 14:07.090
You look great, congratulations.

14:07.110 --> 14:09.129
-Thanks.
-Is Gustavo here?

14:09.149 --> 14:11.120
It's not Gustavo's.

14:11.139 --> 14:14.190
-Oh, gosh...
-It's someone else's.

14:14.210 --> 14:16.169
Do you want water? I'll fetch
some.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.019
-No?
-No, thanks.

14:18.039 --> 14:19.210
I'll be right back.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.210
-Lovely to see you.
-Likewise.

14:22.230 --> 14:24.049
And how are you? Tell all.

14:24.070 --> 14:25.230
It's my turn, right? I'm good.

14:26.009 --> 14:28.039
Everything is great.
I can't complain.

14:28.059 --> 14:31.110
I have a wonderful husband,
two little girls I adore,

14:31.129 --> 14:33.039
and I work as a lawyer.

14:33.059 --> 14:36.230
You're the last person I
imagined
to be working at a law office.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.220
-Really?
-Julia, people change.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.230
But you were all sort of flower
power.

14:41.009 --> 14:43.169
You were the class hippy,
always on demos and rallys.

14:43.190 --> 14:48.039
But they don't just defend
rich businessmen in those
places, right?

14:48.059 --> 14:51.090
-Of course not. There are all
sorts.
-All sorts.

14:52.129 --> 14:53.169
-Awesome!
-Right.

14:53.190 --> 14:56.220
-These reunions are awesome.
-Yes.

15:01.129 --> 15:02.149
Hi.

15:10.070 --> 15:12.120
Don't worry, chew.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.129
Done.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.149
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:23.179 --> 15:27.019
-Short hair suits you.
-Oh, thanks.

15:28.230 --> 15:33.039
-You've changed your hairstyle
too, right?
-Yeah, I don't comb it now.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.169
-I preferred it before.
-Okay.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.070
So how are you?

15:40.090 --> 15:41.210
How's it going?

15:43.039 --> 15:46.159
Well, if you leave out the
piles,
sore legs,

15:46.179 --> 15:50.129
swollen ankles,
and having to wee every half
hour, fine.

15:52.039 --> 15:53.200
Do you get help?

15:53.220 --> 15:55.039
-The...
-Oh...

15:55.220 --> 15:57.139
The father?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.009
Well, it was a one-off thing.

16:00.070 --> 16:01.110
We're friends.

16:02.059 --> 16:03.129
He's really nice.

16:03.149 --> 16:05.179
-He's a botanist.
-Oh, great.

16:06.059 --> 16:07.200
-What about you?
-No.

16:07.220 --> 16:10.220
No, I'm not with anyone.

16:13.159 --> 16:14.159
I'm going to...

16:14.179 --> 16:16.169
See you.

16:18.230 --> 16:20.120
María...

16:21.049 --> 16:23.029
I'm really sorry.

16:24.139 --> 16:26.049
I was a jerk.

16:27.149 --> 16:28.120
Right.

16:28.139 --> 16:30.059
But a real jerk.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.080
I know.

16:35.039 --> 16:37.100
I hope you can forgive me some
day.

16:40.139 --> 16:41.200
Okay.

16:41.220 --> 16:43.190
You'll forgive me?

16:44.200 --> 16:47.000
I meant okay about what you
said.

16:47.019 --> 16:49.220
"I hope you can..." Okay, then.

16:52.090 --> 16:55.139
Hey, here's the star couple of
the party!

16:55.159 --> 16:57.039
Mariavo!

16:57.059 --> 16:58.230
María, Gustavo... Mariavo!

16:59.009 --> 17:01.129
-Remember that, huh?
-Well, actually, I didn't.

17:01.149 --> 17:03.039
-But now I do.
-I did.

17:03.059 --> 17:04.119
Jesus!

17:04.140 --> 17:06.099
-You're in the club!
-Yes.

17:06.119 --> 17:07.230
-A little Mariavo!
-Well...

17:08.009 --> 17:09.140
Congratulations!

17:09.160 --> 17:13.029
Commiserations, you never know,
huh?

17:14.119 --> 17:15.210
This song is so cool!

17:15.230 --> 17:17.160
Time to go and boogie, huh?

17:17.180 --> 17:19.089
-So glad to have seen you.
-Yes.

17:19.109 --> 17:22.039
-Mariavo...
-Mariavo.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.190
Mariavo.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.190
-What a pain.
-Big time.

17:27.230 --> 17:29.200
Shall we have a beer?

17:34.059 --> 17:35.230
To the girls!

17:36.230 --> 17:38.039
How's it going?

17:38.059 --> 17:42.009
I have a son and another on the
way,
and my working hours were
impossible.

17:42.029 --> 17:43.150
I spend the day giving up stuff.

17:43.170 --> 17:46.130
One day, I give up sleeping,
another day, waxing...

17:46.150 --> 17:49.150
Then a miracle occurred:
reduced working hours.

17:49.170 --> 17:52.170
Now I have time
and I don't feel like a bad
mother.

17:52.190 --> 17:56.190
But if you like your job,
reduced working hours is a
bummer.

17:56.210 --> 17:58.059
-Tough luck.
-Tough luck.

17:58.079 --> 18:01.160
No, you choose: work, kids,
or peace of mind.

18:01.180 --> 18:05.009
I'm into peace of mind.
The yoga I do leaves me
feeling...

18:05.029 --> 18:07.119
I didn't have to give up
anything.

18:07.140 --> 18:10.009
-Huh?
-I organize it with my husband.

18:10.029 --> 18:13.039
-He asked for reduced working
hours.
-Can you do that?

18:13.059 --> 18:16.019
He works afternoons
and stays with the kids in the
morning,

18:16.039 --> 18:17.180
and I go to the clinic.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.059
Now you're going to tell me
he helps around the house?

18:20.079 --> 18:22.210
He always cooks,
but because he really likes it

18:22.230 --> 18:24.140
and he's great at it.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.140
-Amazing!
-And he's good at eating you
out, too?

18:27.160 --> 18:29.170
I won't go into detail...

18:32.039 --> 18:35.059
That's no husband you've got,
that's a miracle.

18:35.079 --> 18:37.180
Honestly, he deserves an award.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.109
Well, he's getting one now.

18:39.130 --> 18:40.140
Really?

18:41.019 --> 18:42.160
Father of the Year.

18:42.180 --> 18:44.099
-Really?
-Look, look.

18:44.119 --> 18:47.079
-How do you mean Father of the
Year?
-Yes, yes.

18:47.099 --> 18:49.160
-Oh, how sweet.
-That's him.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.089
Let's see.

18:51.109 --> 18:53.079
Oh, this is too much.

18:54.119 --> 18:57.039
Excuse me.
Your attention, please.

18:57.059 --> 18:58.190
Hi, may I have your attention?

18:58.210 --> 19:02.039
The time has come
to give a big round of applause

19:02.059 --> 19:03.150
to this evening's star.

19:03.170 --> 19:06.210
Give it up for: The Father of
the Year.

19:22.029 --> 19:23.119
Eduardo...

19:23.140 --> 19:28.069
This award acknowledges the
tremendous
effort made in supporting your
wife

19:28.089 --> 19:31.210
in her duties as a mother and a
wife.

19:31.230 --> 19:35.150
And you did all of this
without quitting your job.

19:35.170 --> 19:38.069
This award and these applause
are for you.

19:47.059 --> 19:49.079
Thank you very much. Thanks.

19:49.099 --> 19:53.059
I want to dedicate this award
to the person I most admire:

19:53.079 --> 19:54.119
My father.

19:58.210 --> 20:00.009
-Are you coming?
-Huh?

20:00.029 --> 20:02.079
Her husband's cooking the fish
he caught.

20:02.099 --> 20:03.180
Oh, okay.

20:04.079 --> 20:07.130
That way we see for ourselves,
I still don't believe it.

20:07.150 --> 20:10.089
All right, fine.

20:10.109 --> 20:11.180
Come whenever you want.

20:12.200 --> 20:16.130
I don't want to say I'm pregnant
so they let me jump the queue.

20:16.150 --> 20:19.140
But I'm peeing myself.
There must be other toilets,
right?

20:19.160 --> 20:21.220
I'll take a look.
Bugger it!

20:22.000 --> 20:23.109
-Come with me.
-Where?

20:23.130 --> 20:26.009
-Come on.
-Where? Hang on.

20:26.029 --> 20:27.170
I'm weeing myself!

20:30.170 --> 20:32.119
Not so fast, I'll dribble.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.099
You shouldn't be listening to me
wee.

20:39.039 --> 20:41.000
Sounds the same as always.

20:47.230 --> 20:50.000
-Are you still there?
-Yeah.

21:39.119 --> 21:40.210
What's wrong?

21:41.059 --> 21:43.079
-Do I freak you out?
-No, no.

21:44.099 --> 21:46.150
It's okay. You can do it.

21:46.170 --> 21:48.150
It's even recommendable.

21:48.230 --> 21:50.000
Okay.

21:59.029 --> 22:00.160
Hang on.

22:12.190 --> 22:14.049
Just a sec.

22:39.049 --> 22:40.000
Thanks.

22:40.019 --> 22:41.220
Wow, it's unbelievable!

22:42.000 --> 22:45.029
Sure it is!
The rumors were right!

22:45.049 --> 22:47.200
After all this time,
as if nothing had happened.

22:47.220 --> 22:50.019
-Er... Excuse me a minute.
-Sure.

22:54.079 --> 22:55.180
What are you doing here?

22:55.200 --> 22:57.099
I came to give you a surprise.

22:57.119 --> 23:00.130
I told the film crew
I had an emergency.

23:01.109 --> 23:03.130
Right, but this is a school
reunion.

23:03.150 --> 23:06.089
I gatecrashed.
So I could party with you.

23:07.079 --> 23:10.000
God, Cris.
Lately we hardly see each other.

23:10.019 --> 23:13.220
Afterwards we can go to a hotel,
order some champagne...

23:14.000 --> 23:16.019
Right, and what about the kids?

23:16.039 --> 23:18.160
You need to be back home by 12.

23:18.180 --> 23:20.029
-Your mum's there.
-No, Pablo.

23:20.049 --> 23:22.049
She has a bad back,
she needs to sleep at home.

23:22.069 --> 23:24.130
Jesus, Cris.
It's okay just for one night.

23:24.150 --> 23:27.059
-She can sleep in our bed.
-I said no, Pablo. No.

23:27.079 --> 23:30.039
This is my night,
it's your turn to be with the
girls.

23:30.059 --> 23:32.069
Go home,
my mum is waiting to go.

23:32.130 --> 23:34.099
Fair enough, Cris.

23:34.119 --> 23:37.190
I'm trying to be a bit romantic,
making an effort...

23:37.210 --> 23:39.190
See you at home.

23:42.230 --> 23:44.000
Pablo!

23:45.000 --> 23:46.039
What?

23:47.150 --> 23:50.089
Why don't you ask for a
reduction
in working hours?

23:51.119 --> 23:53.170
You could spend more time
with the girls, right?

23:53.190 --> 23:56.059
Why this now?

23:56.079 --> 23:57.230
I've got tons of work.

23:58.009 --> 24:00.170
All these deals I'm closing
will be great for us.

24:00.190 --> 24:02.210
I have tons of work at the law
office,
too.

24:02.230 --> 24:05.130
Right, but I'm not asking you
to work less hours.

24:05.150 --> 24:08.089
Of course not. You don't need
it,
I do everything.

24:08.109 --> 24:09.079
What do you think?

24:09.099 --> 24:12.220
That I wouldn't like to spend
more time at home with my
family?

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
And do you think I wouldn't like
to be
more focused on my job?

24:16.019 --> 24:18.049
I'm fucking sick
of doing everything!

24:18.069 --> 24:21.150
And I don't get any bloody award
for being Mother of the Year!

24:21.170 --> 24:24.029
Are you listening to what you're
saying?

24:24.049 --> 24:25.190
Like you hate being with your
kids.

24:25.210 --> 24:28.089
Well sometimes I can't stand
them!

24:37.019 --> 24:40.049
Then I don't understand
why you want another kid.

24:44.009 --> 24:47.019
I've been taking the pill for
eight months.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.079
Hi, Federico.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.009
We don't know if we'll call him
Federico.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.069
Gari doesn't like it.
Says it's an old man's name.

25:24.140 --> 25:25.170
All right...

25:26.190 --> 25:29.049
Gari is mentally disabled.

25:31.160 --> 25:35.029
It isn't genetic,
he was deprived of oxygen at
birth.

25:35.220 --> 25:37.170
And the baby is fine.

25:39.049 --> 25:42.000
I was on drugs when...

25:42.119 --> 25:44.150
-And I didn't realize.
-On drugs?

25:45.130 --> 25:46.200
You?

25:47.029 --> 25:48.069
Yes, is there a problem?

25:48.089 --> 25:50.039
No, nothing. I don't know.

25:50.059 --> 25:53.130
It was the day of the notary.
The day you left me.

25:58.230 --> 26:00.200
Will he be able to be a father?

26:06.230 --> 26:08.019
Yes.

26:09.069 --> 26:11.109
He has a 43% disability.

26:11.190 --> 26:14.079
It's sort of borderline
intelligence.

26:14.099 --> 26:15.220
What about you?

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Meaning?

26:17.019 --> 26:18.140
Are you happy?

26:23.019 --> 26:24.029
Yes.

26:37.109 --> 26:39.069
Shall we do lunch tomorrow?

26:43.220 --> 26:45.049
Yes.

27:12.150 --> 27:15.130
I must survive...

27:15.230 --> 27:18.210
lying to myself.

27:23.099 --> 27:26.089
Silently, I lost heart in that
bar.

27:27.069 --> 27:30.029
Where an angel said to me
when I walked in:

27:31.109 --> 27:35.029
"Come and rise up like blue
smoke.

27:35.049 --> 27:37.170
Suffer no more, love."

27:38.230 --> 27:45.009
And tearing myself away,
something changed in my life.

27:45.029 --> 27:50.009
I will survive!

27:50.089 --> 27:53.099
I will look for a home

27:54.140 --> 27:58.099
among the rubble

27:58.119 --> 28:01.009
of my loneliness.

28:02.049 --> 28:05.039
A strange paradise

28:06.039 --> 28:08.059
where you are not to be found.

28:09.210 --> 28:14.000
And though it hurts,
I yearn for freedom.

28:17.109 --> 28:19.190
Even though it hurts me.

28:55.089 --> 28:57.220
I had sex with Gus in the gym.

29:03.150 --> 29:06.000
I'm cheating on Pablo.

29:16.039 --> 29:17.140
It's all right.

29:18.009 --> 29:20.220
Incredible to think 15 years
have gone by, right?

29:21.000 --> 29:22.089
Tell me about it.

29:24.069 --> 29:27.079
In 15 years from now we'll be...

29:28.099 --> 29:29.200
