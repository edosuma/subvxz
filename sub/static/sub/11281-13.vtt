00:03.837 --> 00:04.738
* Attack me with your love...

00:04.772 --> 00:05.906
CHRIS ROCK:
When I was 15 going on 16,

00:05.939 --> 00:09.043
the one thing I wanted most
was a kiss from a girl,

00:09.077 --> 00:10.311
and I didn't care who it was

00:10.344 --> 00:12.513
as long as she wasn't
in my family.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.782
At the time, I thought
I would only get a kiss

00:14.815 --> 00:16.584
one of a few ways.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.087
There was
"catch a girl, kiss a girl."

00:19.120 --> 00:22.656
She ran faster than Flo Jo.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.326
There was "kiss a girl
and run like hell."

00:25.359 --> 00:26.794
Huh!

00:26.827 --> 00:29.130
* The third one is irrelevant

00:29.163 --> 00:31.499
* 'Cause there's no time
or place *

00:31.532 --> 00:33.801
And there was spin the bottle.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.070
* Attack me
with your love, baby *

00:36.104 --> 00:38.206
Ooh!

00:38.239 --> 00:40.141
* Attack me with your love

00:40.174 --> 00:41.142
Hey, Chris.

00:41.175 --> 00:41.809
Hey, Tasha.

00:41.842 --> 00:42.810
Hey, Drew.
Hey.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.445
* Attack me with your love...

00:44.478 --> 00:45.679
Hey, man, you
still like Tasha?

00:45.713 --> 00:47.348
Does Angelina Jolie
like black babies?

00:47.381 --> 00:48.549
Yeah.

00:48.582 --> 00:49.850
You know she plays
spin the bottle.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.219
You're lying.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.220
For real.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.221
Everybody's playing.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.189
And he meant everybody.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.162
So, if I can get
in the game,

01:01.195 --> 01:03.131
maybe I can get
a kiss from her.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.064
Yeah, if you're lucky.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.666
If I was lucky,
I wouldn't be counting

01:05.699 --> 01:07.401
on an empty bottle
to get me a kiss.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.578
* Ah, make it funky now.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.703
Have you ever been to a
spin the bottle party?

01:42.736 --> 01:44.538
Hi. I don't believe
we've met before.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.174
My name is Greg.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.409
No, I haven't been
to a spin the bottle party.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.411
I mean, I haven't
been to a party.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.413
Why would you
even ask me that?

01:52.446 --> 01:53.847
Because I'm trying
to get into one.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.250
Hold on. You do
know what they do

01:56.284 --> 01:56.884
at those parties, right?

01:56.917 --> 01:58.619
Yeah. People kiss.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.489
Oh. I must be thinking of a
different kind of game, then.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.691
Greg wrote about that party
in his book,

02:03.724 --> 02:05.193
Ow, There's a Bottle in My...

02:05.226 --> 02:06.427
So, you ever
kiss anybody?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.296
Hah. Have I?

02:08.329 --> 02:09.630
You gotta be kidding me.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.199
Cousins don't count.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.234
Oh. Then no.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.769
Are you sure you really want
to play spin the bottle?

02:15.803 --> 02:17.205
I mean, there's
always a chance

02:17.238 --> 02:18.306
that you'll end up
kissing somebody

02:18.339 --> 02:19.440
that's... I don't know.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.441
Let's just say...

02:20.474 --> 02:21.542
Ugly!

02:21.575 --> 02:22.910
I don't think you get it.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.945
Tasha is at this party.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.248
There's no guarantee your
spin's gonna land on her.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.182
Listen, for me
it's a win-win.

02:28.216 --> 02:30.718
And all I know is,
I'm gonna get a kiss.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.455
Hey, Mr. Omar.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.789
Hey.

02:35.823 --> 02:36.790
Who died?

02:36.824 --> 02:37.758
Oh. Mr. Abernathy.

02:37.791 --> 02:41.629
Got decapitated
by a flying hubcap. Tragic.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.796
Tragic!

02:42.830 --> 02:44.198
Is that his wife?

02:44.232 --> 02:45.199
Mm-hmm.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.200
Mmm.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.269
See ya.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.803
Oh, hey, hey! Drew, Drew.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.473
You got, uh, five dollars
I could borrow?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.342
I don't loan money.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.944
Come on.
You know I'm good for it.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.946
Drew inherited one quality
from my father--

02:58.979 --> 03:02.316
he was a tightwad, and he saved
every penny he got,

03:02.350 --> 03:03.584
no matter how he got it.

03:15.996 --> 03:16.964
Here.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.932
Oh, thank you, son.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.701
When are you gonna
pay me back?

03:20.734 --> 03:21.502
Never!
Tomorrow.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.271
Cool.
Okay.

03:23.304 --> 03:26.840
Hey. Uh.. just keep the
change. That's all you.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.376
All right?

03:29.877 --> 03:30.844
Oh, hey, Tasha.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.112
What's going on?

03:32.145 --> 03:34.582
Nothing. Just need to pick up
some milk for my grandmother.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.851
Oh. Would you like me to spin
over there and get you a bottle?

03:37.885 --> 03:40.354
No. Why are you
acting weird?

03:40.388 --> 03:42.356
Oh, I just heard
that you were at a party

03:42.390 --> 03:43.424
in the neighborhood
the other night.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.292
What?

03:44.325 --> 03:45.726
Yeah, you know, spin the...

03:45.759 --> 03:46.727
Hi-ya!

03:48.696 --> 03:51.865
Look, don't you ever,
ever, ever repeat it.

03:51.899 --> 03:52.866
Okay.
Okay?

03:52.900 --> 03:53.667
I won't say anything.
Okay.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.669
I just wanted
to go to the next one.

03:55.703 --> 03:56.770
Well, it's
not up to me.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.606
Lisa sets up
the parties.

03:58.639 --> 03:59.740
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.008
Can you let me go?

04:01.041 --> 04:02.410
No. Promise you're not
going to tell nobody.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.411
:
I promise.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.578
Promise?
I promise.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.046
Again.
I promise.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.448
Promise.
I promise.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.482
One more time.
I promise.

04:08.516 --> 04:09.783
All right.

04:09.817 --> 04:13.921
Tasha went on to become the
first female Ultimate Fighter.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.789
I'm sorry, it's just if
my grandmother finds out,

04:15.823 --> 04:17.625
she'll kill me.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.827
Well, then, I just need
to talk to Lisa.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.995
You can't ask her,
she has to ask you,

04:22.029 --> 04:23.631
and you can't tell
her I told you.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.633
It was like getting
into the Mafia.

04:25.666 --> 04:29.036
All right, well, give me
something to work with.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.671
How do I get into the game?

04:30.704 --> 04:33.541
She likes Prince.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.843
Okay.

04:37.845 --> 04:42.316
Well, thank you for coming,
Lionel Richie family.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.017
While I was being choked
by Tasha,

04:44.051 --> 04:47.388
my mother's past
was being revived.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.690
Mm.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.092
"An old flame
will be reignited."

04:53.561 --> 04:54.928
What does yours say, baby?

04:54.962 --> 04:56.430
Oh, I don't care.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.465
They're all silly anyway.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.800
No, no, they're real.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.669
My wife writes the fortunes.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.937
She can see into the future.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.443
"Here comes Lance"?

05:09.477 --> 05:11.545
Lance?

05:12.680 --> 05:13.881
Rochelle?

05:13.914 --> 05:15.015
Is that you?

05:15.048 --> 05:16.517
Oh, my God.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.519
Lance, what are you doing
around here?

05:18.552 --> 05:20.521
I just bought another Laundromat
in the neighborhood.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.889
You know Sire Suds?

05:21.922 --> 05:23.357
That's you?
That's me.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.526
Washing machines
fit for a a queen.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.497
Oh, well, Lance,
this is my husband, Julius,

05:29.530 --> 05:31.131
and my daughter, Tonya.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.466
Hi.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.034
What a lovely family.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.936
But I always knew
you had good genes.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.771
:
Oh, stop it.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.741
Oh... What about you?

05:40.774 --> 05:41.775
Are you married?

05:41.809 --> 05:44.912
No, no, I, uh, let all
the good ones get away.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.146
Yeah, sorry to hear that.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.581
Nice to meet you, Larry.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.583
Lance.
Okay.

05:49.617 --> 05:52.420
It's great seeing
you again, Rochelle.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.121
Next time you come down, I'll
give you a few free loads.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.857
Also, here are some
coupons for, uh,

05:56.890 --> 05:58.759
a new dry cleaners
I'm opening.

05:58.792 --> 06:02.596
My father would take a coupon
from bin Laden.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.597
Thanks, Lurch.

06:03.631 --> 06:04.598
It's Larry.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.133
It's Lance.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.968
Take care.
Good-bye, Rochelle.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.070
Nice meeting you.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.972
All right, Lance.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.746
What?

06:20.748 --> 06:25.519
After tomorrow came and went,
Drew came and went off.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.987
Hey, Drew.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.088
My man.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.423
Where's my money?

06:29.457 --> 06:31.459
Oh...

06:31.492 --> 06:33.761
Man, I'm sorry, I totally
forgot all about that.

06:33.794 --> 06:34.862
It's okay.

06:34.895 --> 06:35.896
You can pay me now.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.198
Okay.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.668
You know what?

06:40.701 --> 06:42.736
I left my wallet
at the office.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.872
The office
in your back pocket?
So...

06:44.905 --> 06:46.507
can I pay you tomorrow?
Yeah,

06:46.540 --> 06:47.741
but I'm gonna have
to charge you interest.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.477
Interest?
15%.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.111
15%? That's outrageous.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.146
On the streets it's 17.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.048
I'm doing you a favor.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.049
I'll be back.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.184
Black Terminator.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.655
While Drew was trying
to settle a debt,

07:01.689 --> 07:03.824
I was trying to set up a score.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.062
Hey, Lisa.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.230
Chris.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.231
What you been up to?

07:11.264 --> 07:13.100
Oh, nothing, I've just
been around, you know,

07:13.133 --> 07:14.602
at home listening
to Prince, but...

07:14.635 --> 07:15.569
For real?

07:15.603 --> 07:17.838
I love Prince
and anything to do with him.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.473
She went
to see The Color Purple

07:19.507 --> 07:21.108
because she assumed
it was about Prince.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.142
Can I show you something?

07:22.175 --> 07:23.143
What?

07:23.176 --> 07:24.177
Do you remember at
the end of Purple Rain

07:24.211 --> 07:27.214
when Prince sprayed
everybody with his guitar?

07:27.247 --> 07:28.816
Yeah, I'll
never forget it.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.183
Yeah, well, check this out.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.686
Oh, my God, is that...?
Yes,

07:32.720 --> 07:34.855
it's the hose he attached
to the back of his guitar.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.524
Where did you get that?

07:36.557 --> 07:38.158
I found it in the street,
dummy.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.960
I got a friend
who lives in Minneapolis.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.729
Oh, my God, can I touch it?

07:41.762 --> 07:42.863
I'm not even touching that.

07:42.896 --> 07:43.997
Maybe.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.734
Look, what do you know about
this spin the bottle party?

07:49.570 --> 07:50.904
Who told you?
Nobody.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.005
No, somebody.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.507
Who?
I won't tell you.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.976
Who?
No.

07:56.009 --> 08:00.514
Okay, my house,
8:00 tomorrow night.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.750
Don't tell anybody.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.652
Thanks.

08:06.019 --> 08:09.723
Ever since that day,
I've always loved hose.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.567
Hey, Daddy.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.602
Hey, baby.

08:21.635 --> 08:24.838
Listen, I need you to do
something for me, okay?

08:24.872 --> 08:27.808
Okay.
Your mother's birthday
is coming up.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.977
Yeah, in three months.

08:30.010 --> 08:34.748
Right, and I want to throw
a little party for her

08:34.782 --> 08:37.150
and I was thinking of inviting
her friend Lance, but...

08:37.184 --> 08:38.151
I don't know...

08:38.185 --> 08:40.253
You want me to ask Mama
if she likes Lance?

08:40.287 --> 08:41.589
Yeah.

08:41.622 --> 08:44.658
Well, Daddy, I don't
think I can do that.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.760
At least not for free.

08:46.794 --> 08:49.262
Are you asking me for money?

08:49.296 --> 08:50.964
Are you asking me
to spy on Mama?

08:50.998 --> 08:52.633
It's not spying.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.702
I just want you to ask her
a couple questions.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.970
Well, how come
you can't ask her?

08:57.004 --> 08:59.172
Because here's five dollars,
that's how come.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.112
I'll take care of it.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.279
Thank you.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.683
Tonya made more money that
year than my father.

09:09.717 --> 09:13.353
At school, Greg was putting
his usual spin on things.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.321
Dude, you're so in there.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.657
Yeah, and Tasha's coming.

09:16.690 --> 09:17.858
Don't get
your hopes up.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.127
The statistical chances of you
actually getting to kiss her

09:20.160 --> 09:22.162
when there's six other players
at the party are about...

09:22.195 --> 09:23.631
six to one.

09:23.664 --> 09:26.333
Better than my usual
348 million to one.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.868
I'm not worried
about that.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.737
You shouldn't be worried
about it.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.174
:
I just don't know if
I'm gonna do it right.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.977
Lip-ups.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.879
What?
Lip-ups.

09:38.912 --> 09:39.680
Richie Cunningham
was afraid

09:39.713 --> 09:41.014
of the same thing
on Happy Days

09:41.048 --> 09:42.883
and the Fonz told him
to do lip-ups.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.652
Put your face on the floor
and push up with your lips.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.053
What

09:46.086 --> 09:47.788
I'm not kissing the floor.

09:47.821 --> 09:51.091
This is what happens when you
watch shows about white people.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.862
What are you doing?

09:54.895 --> 09:57.164
Oh, I was just looking
for a quarter I dropped.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.667
Oh. Well, it looked like
you were doing lip-ups.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.069
You know those don't work.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.004
The hardest part
about practicing kissing

10:04.037 --> 10:05.906
is trying to do it by yourself.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.876
TONYA:
Ugh!

10:08.909 --> 10:10.678
Boy, what is wrong with you?

10:10.711 --> 10:12.713
Can't a boy kiss himself
in the mirror in peace?

10:13.747 --> 10:15.916
Mr. Omar?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.417
Drew

10:17.450 --> 10:18.819
Where's my money?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.654
You said you were
coming back tomorrow.

10:20.688 --> 10:21.722
It is tomorrow.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.691
It's 4:00 in the morning, man.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.025
I want my money.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.394
Drew, I got to get up in
the morning and go to work.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.029
And I got to get up
and go to school,

10:29.062 --> 10:31.799
but I can't concentrate
because I don't have my money.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.702
Okay, okay.

10:34.735 --> 10:35.869
Can you give me another day?

10:35.903 --> 10:37.738
Fine.

10:37.771 --> 10:40.708
But another day is going
to cost you another dollar.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.043
And after tomorrow, that's it.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.778
What's it?

10:44.812 --> 10:45.679
Nothing.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.748
I'd just hate to see
something bad happen.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.416
What kind of something?

10:49.449 --> 10:51.685
Something tragic.

10:51.719 --> 10:54.187
Have a nice night.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.924
Drew went on to help found
Death Row Records.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.159
Omar's day had taken a turn
for the worse,

10:59.192 --> 11:01.729
but my night was about to get
a whole lot better.

11:01.762 --> 11:02.930
Come in.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.432
I need you to watch Tonya.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.266
What?

11:06.299 --> 11:07.434
I'll be back around 9:00.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.369
Okay, baby, be good.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.738
All right.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.206
In bed by 9:00
and stay out of my room.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.412
What are you looking at?

11:19.446 --> 11:22.850
About five to ten when I
drown you in that cereal bowl.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.319
I need you to do
something for me.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.421
What?
I'm going out,

11:28.455 --> 11:29.757
and I need you to stay here
and keep your mouth shut.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.191
That's five dollar's
worth of need.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.027
Fine. Mom will be back
at 9:00, be in bed.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.196
And if I don't get in trouble,
I'll pay you when I get back.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.231
Okay.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.167
Tonya invested
all of her extortion money

11:40.200 --> 11:41.468
and retired at 30.

11:42.635 --> 11:45.238
Playing spin the bottle
was one of the greatest moments

11:45.272 --> 11:46.974
of my teenage life.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.809
It was the best shortcut
to kissing girls,

11:48.842 --> 11:52.045
outside of becoming famous.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.848
Ooh, Susan.

11:54.882 --> 11:55.916
Mm.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.234
I wish that was me
kissing her.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.038
Please, please, please.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.541
Damn, damn, damn.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.045
Instead of spinning the bottle,

12:25.078 --> 12:27.080
I wanted to bust it
over his head.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.851
TASHA:
Chris, your turn.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.853
Finally!

12:36.023 --> 12:38.191
Hey, this ain't
the Logo channel.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.994
Spin it again, Chris.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.830
I needed the bottle
to point to a girl

12:42.863 --> 12:46.033
so I could take my lips
for a spin.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.082
It wasn't Tasha,
but I could pretend.

13:02.115 --> 13:08.355
* Yes, I'm saving all my love
for you... *

13:08.388 --> 13:10.423
*

13:10.457 --> 13:12.993
TASHA:
Dag, Chris, that's enough.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.930
You act like it's your first
kiss or something.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.265
Wait till I tell Greg.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.101
If you tell anybody,
I will break your lips.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.871
In that case, wait till I write
Greg a detailed letter.

13:27.274 --> 13:30.077
After my first kiss, the world
seemed like a different place.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.912
A girl's lips had touched mine.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.848
It was great, and nothing
was ever going to change that.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.025
So you're Chris?

13:45.058 --> 13:47.160
Yeah. Who are you?

13:47.194 --> 13:48.428
Nobody.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.498
Just a dude who wanted to know
who my girl was talking about.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.632
What?

13:52.665 --> 13:53.600
It's cool, man.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.602
I just want her
to be happy.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.504
But I still
love her though.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.606
But, you know, if you're
the one she wants,

13:59.639 --> 14:01.975
then, you know,
that-that-that's cool.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.576
That's cool. I'm gonna
just deal with that.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.611
Deal with that?

14:04.644 --> 14:06.246
Man, what are you
talking about?

14:06.279 --> 14:07.414
It's ai'ight, man.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.316
You won. You won.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.618
You know it, I know it,

14:11.651 --> 14:13.320
and Susan knows it.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.155
But check this out.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.190
If you mess up...

14:17.224 --> 14:19.059
I'll be there.

14:19.092 --> 14:22.529
Hopefully not with one glove
and a friend in a Bronco.

14:23.931 --> 14:26.033
I'm gonna be there, Chris!

14:26.066 --> 14:28.668
I will be there!

14:28.701 --> 14:30.470
While I had one foot
in the grave,

14:30.503 --> 14:33.473
Tonya was digging up dirt.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.109
Hey, baby.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.277
Hey, Ma.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.146
Can I ask you something?

14:39.179 --> 14:40.914
Sure. What is it?

14:40.948 --> 14:43.150
Did you ever kiss Lance?

14:43.183 --> 14:44.584
Smooth.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.687
That, Tonya, is none
of your business.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.656
Okay, well...

14:49.689 --> 14:52.926
do you love Lance more
than you love Daddy?

14:52.960 --> 14:54.161
Instead of beating
around a bush,

14:54.194 --> 14:55.595
Tonya took a chainsaw to it.

14:55.628 --> 14:58.298
ROCHELLE:
Well, since you're so interested
in knowing what happened,

14:58.331 --> 15:01.101
I guess I'll tell you.

15:01.134 --> 15:05.939
I was dating Lance
and then I met your father.

15:05.973 --> 15:08.241
You want to know why
I broke up with Lance?

15:08.275 --> 15:10.077
Why?

15:10.110 --> 15:12.579
Because your father was,

15:12.612 --> 15:17.150
is and will always be
the love of my life.

15:17.184 --> 15:18.718
Okay?

15:18.751 --> 15:21.021
Okay.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.689
That okay with you, Julius?

15:22.722 --> 15:25.192
Okay.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.998
Brooklyn was the home
of many modern trends,

15:31.031 --> 15:32.966
stalking was one of them.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.634
So was the sensitive thug.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.303
So was the restraining order.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.171
Years later,
Dwayne would go on to be

15:38.205 --> 15:40.373
the first guy from Brooklyn
to have a prison marriage

15:40.407 --> 15:44.377
with a girl he stalked,
stabbed and restrained.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.617
Hey, Chris.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.052
Who is Dwayne and why is
he following me around

15:52.085 --> 15:53.186
and standing outside my house?

15:54.221 --> 15:57.457
Oh, he's my boyfriend.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.360
But he wasn't acting right,
so I told him about our kiss.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.729
I thought you said
not to tell anybody.
You didn't, did you?

16:02.762 --> 16:04.197
We're not talking about me.
We're talking about you.

16:04.231 --> 16:07.034
And plus, you don't
have somebody following
you around in fatigues?

16:07.067 --> 16:08.168
Hey, calm down, okay?

16:08.201 --> 16:09.336
He ain't gonna do nothing.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.503
How do you know?

16:10.537 --> 16:11.671
I'll talk to him.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.340
Isn't that how
all this got started?

16:20.080 --> 16:22.382
Can I ask you a question?

16:22.415 --> 16:24.551
Sure.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.219
That kiss, I mean,
was it good?

16:26.253 --> 16:29.422
Was it too much lip,
too sloppy?

16:29.456 --> 16:32.759
It was... fine.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.761
You're a good kisser.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.196
Really?

16:36.229 --> 16:37.764
Yeah.

16:43.270 --> 16:47.240
At that moment, I had never
been more happy, or afraid.

16:47.274 --> 16:51.144
I had two kisses and a death
threat, and I was cashing out.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.146
Really.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.814
It was nice.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.351
If you tell anybody,
I will break your tongue.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.353
Shouldn't I be saying that?

17:00.387 --> 17:03.323
While I was counting
my blessings,

17:03.356 --> 17:05.725
Mr. Omar had to pay the piper.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.228
I know it's hard
to lose your husband.

17:08.261 --> 17:12.031
But remember, he's in
a better place right now.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.667
Drew?!

17:14.701 --> 17:16.269
Where's my money?

17:16.303 --> 17:18.305
Man, we're on our way
to a funeral.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.140
You want to make it two?

17:21.508 --> 17:23.510
You're not going anywhere
until I get my money.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.614
You got five dollars
I could borrow?

17:27.647 --> 17:29.149
Seven.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.183
Seven.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.619
This is coming out
of your bill.

17:32.652 --> 17:37.190
Mr. Omar hated paying back
money even if it wasn't his.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.591
Thank you.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.193
And, uh,
sorry about your husband.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.494
At least one of them is.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.300
While Drew collected his money,

17:47.334 --> 17:49.136
Susan called
to collect her man.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.814
Hey, Chris.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.015
Hey.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.218
Could you come down for a
second, I want to talk to you.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.319
Sure.
The funny thing about girls is

18:06.353 --> 18:09.122
even when they say
they don't care what you do,

18:09.156 --> 18:12.492
they still care
who you're doing it with.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.262
I heard about
you and Susan.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.163
Heard what?

18:16.196 --> 18:18.198
You know.
Everybody knows.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.166
She broke up with Dwayne
for you.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.333
Who told you that?

18:20.367 --> 18:21.501
Dwayne.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.902
Well, it's not true.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.504
Oh.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.140
I was going to say,
after one kiss, dang.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.142
I had no idea
what all that meant,

18:29.176 --> 18:30.377
but I took it as a compliment.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.545
So do you like her?

18:32.579 --> 18:34.747
I mean, she's all right.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.383
She a good kisser?

18:36.416 --> 18:37.684
Better than my pillow.

18:37.717 --> 18:38.885
It was cool.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.487
You think she's better than me?

18:40.520 --> 18:41.921
Kissing?

18:41.954 --> 18:43.423
No. Tetherball, stupid.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.791
I don't know.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.859
When you kissed Robert,
you looked pretty good.

18:46.893 --> 18:47.927
I did?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.196
Yeah.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.731
Is your mom home?

18:51.764 --> 18:53.833
Uh, no, why?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.935
Can we go upstairs for a second?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.069
What for?

18:57.103 --> 19:00.207
Hey, idiot, can't you see
what's happening here?

19:00.240 --> 19:01.774
I want to show you something.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.243
Okay, cool.
Thank you.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.577
Hi, Tasha.

19:04.611 --> 19:05.912
Hi, Chris.
Dang it.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.747
Hey, Mom.
Hi.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.416
Baby, when you're done here,
I want you to come help me

19:09.449 --> 19:10.783
with dinner, okay?
Okay.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.186
All right. Tasha, tell your
grandmother I say hello.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.355
Come on.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.757
Oh, I forgot I have
to wash the dishes.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.959
Oh, okay, well,
what were you going to show me?

19:19.992 --> 19:21.228
Nothing.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.930
I'll just see you later.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.266
I never did find out what Tasha
was going to show me,

19:26.299 --> 19:30.903
but after my first kiss,
I saw a whole new side of her.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.675
Yes, may I help you?

19:35.708 --> 19:37.310
Hi, are you Chris's mother?

19:37.344 --> 19:38.678
Yes.

19:38.711 --> 19:39.912
Why

19:39.946 --> 19:41.781
He was at a party with
my daughter, Susan,

19:41.814 --> 19:43.283
last Wednesday night.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.384
Oh, no, no, no,
I don't think so.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.419
Chris was here at home
watching my daughter for me

19:46.453 --> 19:47.487
on Wednesday night.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.458
Okay, well, somebody named Chris
was at that party

19:51.491 --> 19:53.460
and she said that he lived here.

19:53.493 --> 19:57.230
Look, I'm just trying to inform
everybody who was at the party

19:57.264 --> 19:59.599
that Susan was contagious
and she has the mumps.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.302
Well, I don't know
what you're talking about

20:02.335 --> 20:04.437
because Chris doesn't have
the mumps.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.339
One minute.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.308
Chris!

20:15.848 --> 20:18.918
Maybe the mumps will cushion
my butt-whupping.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.954
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:21.988 --> 20:25.992
