02:46.375 --> 02:49.168
- Hey, buddy. What's happening, babe?
- What's up, Nick?

02:49.253 --> 02:51.587
- We've got a young fop here, man.
- Yeah?

02:52.798 --> 02:55.258
Nice bike. Fast, huh?

02:56.635 --> 02:58.261
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.598
Wanna bet?

03:03.851 --> 03:06.435
Ain't you got nothing better to do
with your Sundays?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.813
Yeah, I got 50 on Nick, man.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.525
What do you say?

03:15.362 --> 03:18.281
Yeah, sure.
I'll take your Social Security.

03:18.574 --> 03:19.824
Take him, Nick.

04:45.035 --> 04:48.120
You're a real fucking wacko,
you know that, pal?

05:19.069 --> 05:20.611
Nicky, it's me.

05:20.904 --> 05:22.530
The school called again.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.907
We're another month behind.
That makes three.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.909
I told them we'd send a cheque, okay?

05:26.994 --> 05:29.412
Oh, I'm taking the kids to Mom's
on Saturday.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.038
You could have them the next Saturday.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.749
Listen, good luck today. Bye.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.713
Hi. Nick Conklin?
Barney Yudell, attorney.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.924
Do yourself a favour.
Wear a jacket and tie today.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.426
See you at 10:00.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.826
- Hey. How are you, pal, huh?
- Dad!

06:08.910 --> 06:10.536
- Hi, Dad.
- Come here. Hi, buddy. Give me a kiss.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.705
He got in trouble.
He called Sister Elizabeth a name

06:12.789 --> 06:14.707
- and she heard.
- What did you call Elizabeth?

06:14.791 --> 06:17.418
- An ugly goose.
- Ugly goose, huh?

06:17.461 --> 06:19.295
I've heard you say
worse things than that.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.089
Listen, honey, I want you
to give this money to Mommy, okay?

06:22.132 --> 06:25.134
- Okay.
- I'm gonna see you in about two days.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.636
- Have a good day at school.
- Okay.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.975
- All right, pal, you hanging on tight?
- Yeah.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.352
- You still want to go in the rain? Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:35.437 --> 06:36.771
All right.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.349
Dale, Nicky. Okay?

07:18.146 --> 07:20.356
Right here. Right here.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.194
What do you see, baby?

07:25.487 --> 07:27.863
Baby, I hope somebody's paying you
to wear that goddamn suit.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.323
- Almost.
- Come on. Get on.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.075
I don't want anybody seeing you
walk around like that.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.035
- Take me for a ride?
- Let's go.

07:35.872 --> 07:36.872
Look out, Nicky.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.542
Got some new Bostonians.
85 bucks a pop, babe.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.460
Let's hope they threw in some socks
with them.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.671
Ladies of the '80s are going for shoes.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.507
- Yeah? Where did you hear that?
- I read it in a magazine.

07:46.550 --> 07:49.218
They say it's the second place
they're looking.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.345
Listen, I was thinking.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.389
I hear that when Internal Affairs
comes to see you,

07:53.473 --> 07:55.224
it's not as bad
as when you go to see them.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.226
I don't know.
I'll let you know when it's over.

07:57.269 --> 07:58.435
- Here's the idea.
- Yeah?

07:58.520 --> 08:00.354
You dazzle the bastards.
You go in uniform,

08:00.397 --> 08:02.106
you show them your breast bars.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.066
I'm serious. A detective like you,

08:04.151 --> 08:05.985
you got commendations
up the ying-yang.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.070
They should be naming a wing in Attica
after you.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.113
Go ahead.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.952
Hey, Farentino, you ugly mug!

08:15.162 --> 08:17.413
Hey, Vincent. Off and on. Let's go.
Come on, huh?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.123
Grab your dick
and count to infinity, babe.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.207
Fuck you.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.001
Where we meeting? Scalari's?
Lunch on me.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.127
We'll see how it goes, babe.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.211
What do you mean,
"We'll see how it goes"?

08:24.254 --> 08:26.672
- We'll see how it goes.
- Conklin, if you don't show up,

08:26.840 --> 08:29.466
you're going to be in real trouble,
Conklin, okay?

08:29.551 --> 08:31.760
- 1300. Do or die.
- You got it.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.847
Hey, you watch your tail, cowboy.
All right?

08:35.515 --> 08:36.599
Yeah.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.933
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, baby.

08:45.984 --> 08:49.403
You'll walk, Nick, if you tell the truth
and you keep your wits.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.530
Run your mouth
and they'll screw you, man.

08:51.615 --> 08:52.907
I got nothing to hide.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.783
I hope not, for my sake.

08:56.328 --> 08:57.703
- Conklin.
- Hey, Bobby. How you doing?

08:57.787 --> 08:59.163
Hey, Nick.
Hey, listen, good luck tonight.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.456
Thanks, babe.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.792
- How's your lawyer?
- Hardly know him.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.128
Let me tell you something, Nicky.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.339
If these people get their way,

09:08.590 --> 09:10.633
you'll get to know him real well.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.094
Hell, you'll probably be sending
his kids through college.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.735
Well, you're...

09:30.362 --> 09:32.071
It's quite an impressive record.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.614
A regular hero.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.950
Tell me about Monty Ronan.

09:36.368 --> 09:39.245
Good cop. He's... He's the kind of guy

09:39.329 --> 09:41.664
you want backing you up
when the shit goes down.

09:41.748 --> 09:45.834
- That's what you think?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's what I think.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.837
- He's dirt and you know it.
- Oh, yeah?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.798
Well, you worked the streets
with him, huh?

09:50.840 --> 09:53.676
Hey, pal, we got 30 homicides a week,
you know.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.719
Tell us about Patrick Donleavy.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.264
All right, my client has no knowledge

09:58.348 --> 10:00.516
of any malfeasance
on the part of that officer.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.476
Your client's in a good position to know.

10:02.519 --> 10:06.605
28 June, '88,
your unit arrested three suspects.

10:06.856 --> 10:10.234
Cash was logged in
at $65,000 and change.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.195
We have reason to believe
there was over $73,000

10:13.238 --> 10:14.655
in the vehicle you impounded.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.824
- Says who?
- There are sources.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.827
Well, now we're listening to
the suspects instead of the cops, huh?

10:19.869 --> 10:21.328
It depends on the cop.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.956
I don't like heroes, Conklin.
They think the rules don't apply.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.418
Hey, look, I try to do my job, okay?
It ain't easy out there.

10:27.502 --> 10:28.502
And I'm clean.

10:28.545 --> 10:32.047
Well, Detective, you have, what?
A couple of kids at St John's,

10:32.132 --> 10:36.051
house payments, alimony, apartment.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.054
That's a king-sized nut.
I admire your thrift.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.806
Well, life's a bitch.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.558
We did the math, hero.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.269
You're at least 1,000 a month
in the hole.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.937
You're into the shylocks. You're taking.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.189
Hey, you want to charge me, okay,
you charge me.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.191
You want to jerk off,
you go back to your office.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.652
We'll charge you.
Someone will help us out.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.571
Nobody's got a softer centre
than a dirty cop.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.574
You want dirt, huh?
You go to City Hall, huh? Police Plaza.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.534
I mean, the whole goddamn system's
falling apart

11:00.577 --> 11:02.494
and you're busting my ass?

11:05.248 --> 11:06.832
- Suits, man.
- Come on.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.793
- You okay?
- Yeah.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.128
Okay.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.925
How's the girls in Japan?

11:20.388 --> 11:23.682
What is the most important control
exercised by the sergeant

11:23.767 --> 11:25.351
as a first-line supervisor?

11:25.435 --> 11:29.772
- A, cost control, B, manpower...
- B, manpower control.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.107
Manpower control, my ass.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.777
What are we going here for,
sergeant or Supreme Court Justice?

11:34.861 --> 11:37.154
If you want the braid, you gotta
know the stuff. How'd it go?

11:37.238 --> 11:38.489
- How you doing, Joe?
- Good, good.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.783
- Give me a Scotch, will you?
- Scotch?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.159
That bad, huh?

11:42.243 --> 11:44.328
They didn't know
whether to shit or go blind.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.537
Thanks, Joe.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.831
Joe, I think you'd better melt
a little cheese on that Scotch.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.249
He's gonna be drinking his lunch.

11:49.292 --> 11:52.628
To those gallant crime fighters,
Internal Affairs Division.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.004
- Fuck them.
- Fuck them.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.634
- You ought to think about that, pal.
- What's that? IAD?

11:58.718 --> 12:01.887
Ambitious guy like you,
fast way to get to headquarters.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.682
- You never know, babe.
- That's right. You never know.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.479
- You see Abolofia on the way in?
- Yeah, I saw him.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.523
He's importing Subarus now.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.858
Wise guys gotta eat, too, you know.

12:15.318 --> 12:19.071
Just my luck. I'm under investigation.
I'm having lunch with the mob.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.240
Intelligence probably got
this place wired.

12:21.324 --> 12:22.825
Yeah? Well, if you got a beef,

12:22.867 --> 12:25.369
all you got to do is
talk into my left titty here.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.331
Joe, what do you got for a special?

12:29.374 --> 12:33.001
I got a special for you that's so hot,
it's probably illegal.

12:34.629 --> 12:36.004
Look out!

12:37.507 --> 12:39.007
What's going on?

13:36.858 --> 13:38.317
Don't even think about it.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.236
It's done, babe.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.414
What? What did you say? What?

14:29.953 --> 14:31.370
Sit down. Sit down.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.830
Relax. Relax.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.713
It's all right. Let's eat.
Mind our business over here.

14:41.839 --> 14:44.508
Just eat. Relax. Mind your business.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.808
Joey, 911, babe. 911.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.309
Police! Everybody down!

14:54.394 --> 14:55.727
Police! Hold it there!

15:17.959 --> 15:18.959
Hold it!

15:19.419 --> 15:21.295
Get out of the way!

15:24.382 --> 15:26.049
What's going on?

15:27.218 --> 15:28.302
Hey!

15:31.472 --> 15:32.514
Watch it!

15:42.650 --> 15:44.568
Police! Get out of here!

15:59.000 --> 16:01.627
Get the fuck out of there! All of you!

16:07.342 --> 16:08.759
Police, guys.

16:08.843 --> 16:09.885
Guy came through here, where'd he go?

16:09.927 --> 16:10.969
There.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.804
All right, get out of here, all of you!
Get out!

16:16.976 --> 16:18.352
Out! Out! Out!

16:19.145 --> 16:20.395
Go! Get out!

17:20.164 --> 17:21.415
Nicky?

17:21.958 --> 17:23.458
Where are you, Nicky?

17:23.542 --> 17:24.960
Here, Charlie!

17:29.006 --> 17:31.299
You see me? You okay?

17:31.759 --> 17:33.301
You're getting up.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.637
I got him. Up!

17:37.932 --> 17:41.643
Okay. Here we go. Nice and easy.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.687
Come on. Come on.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.024
You little fuck. Come here!

17:48.735 --> 17:50.694
Come here, you little shit.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.654
All right. I got him.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.866
Take him out of here. Get him out.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.827
- Settle down, pal.
- Get him out of here.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.457
Yeah, yeah, just a second.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.208
We got him. Come on.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.585
You okay?

18:14.135 --> 18:15.343
Japanese mob.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.222
Well, our victims are certainly yakuza.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.892
Yeah. The Bureau's sending down a guy
to find out

18:21.976 --> 18:25.270
what the Jap mob and the mafia
were doing sharing a bottle of Chianti.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.772
So that means nobody knows nothing.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.315
Nobody knows dick.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.613
What's that? The paper the box was in?

18:34.739 --> 18:35.822
Yeah.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.116
The famous box.

18:39.702 --> 18:42.037
I'm gonna go down the stairs
and give our little darling a talk.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.663
I gotta make some calls.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.589
Mr Terauchi, thank you for coming.
This is Mr Izawa.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.716
He's my interpreter
during this interrogation.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.927
Our boy doesn't speak any English.

18:57.011 --> 18:59.679
He ain't talking
too much Japanese either.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.140
Who's this guy?

19:02.433 --> 19:04.434
It's the Japanese embassy.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.895
They want him first.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.357
My collar, my case.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.781
Hey, Captain,

19:18.783 --> 19:22.077
I got two clean homicides in there,
right?

19:23.412 --> 19:25.080
I almost bought it.

19:25.623 --> 19:28.333
Now, if they want him,
they can have him

19:29.252 --> 19:30.877
after 20 years to life.

19:35.591 --> 19:36.842
What's this?

19:36.926 --> 19:39.427
Japanese embassy talks
to the State Department,

19:39.512 --> 19:42.639
State to Police Plaza,
they to me and me to you.

19:42.974 --> 19:45.475
Shit rolls downhill. What can I tell you?

19:45.560 --> 19:48.979
They want somebody to take him back.
That's you and Vincent.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.940
This is bullshit, man.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.401
Do you want them
to keep hammering you, Nick, huh?

19:54.443 --> 19:56.653
From what I hear,
you already went off in their faces,

19:56.737 --> 19:59.030
which is exactly what they want.

19:59.323 --> 20:03.493
Take a breather, Nicky. Relax.
Get a geisha. Do us both a favour.

20:03.744 --> 20:04.828
Here.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.997
You give that to Internal Affairs.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.623
As long as they're going to be
in my apartment,

20:08.666 --> 20:10.792
they can water the fucking plants.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.336
I'll stand behind you 100%, Nick,

20:13.963 --> 20:15.630
as long as you're right.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.967
As long as you're right.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.430
May I ask him a few questions?

20:23.472 --> 20:25.849
Fine, be my guest.

21:00.009 --> 21:03.887
So what do you think it's costing the city
to ship this asshole home, huh?

21:04.096 --> 21:07.766
I don't know, but it ain't worth
the cost of the dirt to bury him.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.435
- You know Ronan, right?
- Ronan?

21:10.519 --> 21:11.603
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know Ronan.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.481
- Good cop.
- Yeah, he's a good cop.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.943
He's a good cop.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.613
- He is a good cop.
- All right.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.366
Busts his ass 14 hours a day,

21:24.450 --> 21:27.369
so he can end up in debt
for the rest of his life.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.913
I look at this asshole here.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.708
Man is wearing my house payments.

21:33.876 --> 21:36.086
Listen, just because Ronan
was desperate and he got tempted

21:36.170 --> 21:37.712
doesn't make him less wrong, Nick.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.881
That's bullshit, okay.
You take something off the top

21:39.924 --> 21:43.009
of some dealer you locked up,
you don't get crucified.

21:43.594 --> 21:45.553
You wait till you get a family, pal.

21:45.596 --> 21:48.723
Start there with the private schools,
the braces...

21:48.766 --> 21:51.184
The man is just trying to get by.

21:56.857 --> 21:59.067
What the fuck are you looking at?

22:55.499 --> 22:58.126
Madam, please fasten your seat belt.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.962
Excuse me, sir.
Is your seat belt fastened?

23:01.297 --> 23:02.547
What happened, Nick?

23:02.673 --> 23:04.799
I don't know, man. I think he got a...

23:04.842 --> 23:06.134
He bit his lip or something.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.387
Your seat belt tight, babe?

23:58.604 --> 24:00.939
Here we go, babe.
We got the local heat.

24:01.190 --> 24:02.857
You're looking for us.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.485
Detective Sergeant Conklin, New York.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.239
- Welcome to Japan, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

24:09.323 --> 24:13.785
I am Inspector Nashida,
Osaka Prefectural Police.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.079
This is my partner, Detective Vincent.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.833
Hey, do you got some paperwork for us?

24:19.875 --> 24:20.959
Oh, yes.

24:22.086 --> 24:25.713
Would you sign here and here, please?

24:33.597 --> 24:34.931
Thank you.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.393
- This is all for you.
- Thanks.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.862
- Key, please.
- He's got the key.

24:48.904 --> 24:49.904
Here you go.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.781
Thank you.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.544
Come on, Nicky.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.382
Off duty, Nicky. Off duty.

25:09.425 --> 25:12.093
We're gonna be in and out of geishas
like a Times Square pickpocket.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.761
I wanna go to sleep.

25:14.096 --> 25:15.805
Remember, ladies, if you get bored,

25:15.890 --> 25:18.266
- Hotel Meiji, Hotel Meiji.
- In your dreams.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.352
Detective Conklin,

25:21.437 --> 25:24.022
I am Inspector Yamato,
Osaka Prefectural Police.

25:24.106 --> 25:25.356
Son of a bitch!

25:45.586 --> 25:47.462
They were dressed as officers.

25:47.963 --> 25:49.422
It was in Japanese.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.758
All right?

26:07.024 --> 26:10.735
Captain, look.
They were wearing the uniforms, okay?

26:10.945 --> 26:14.113
They got the paperwork.
It's not like I'm giving them cab fare.

26:14.156 --> 26:16.574
Definite maybe. Definite maybes.

26:17.326 --> 26:18.952
Unseen. Definite no's.

26:18.994 --> 26:21.496
Yeah, it ain't a hell of a lot of fun
over here either, all right.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.498
Now, look, I went by the book, okay.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.501
- There's just no way to verify the ID.
- Nicky.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.382
- Maybe. I don't know.
- Nine definite maybes.

26:33.884 --> 26:37.095
Chief, can I score some coffee? Coffee.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.264
- Coffee.
- One?

26:39.348 --> 26:40.848
- No, two.
- The paperwork's in Japanese.

26:40.891 --> 26:43.017
What do you want me to do?
A strip search?

26:44.270 --> 26:46.271
I'm sitting here two hours, Captain.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.480
Hey! Hey!

26:47.856 --> 26:51.025
Hey! Hey! How much more time?

26:53.570 --> 26:55.363
No. We've got another no.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.740
He does that one more time,
I'm gonna cut it off.

26:57.825 --> 26:59.993
- Nothing, Cap.
- Nicky, look at this.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.870
Unbelievable. Identical strangers.

27:03.831 --> 27:06.082
All right, all right, okay.
But, listen, Captain,

27:06.166 --> 27:08.543
this is still an NYPD collar, right?

27:10.004 --> 27:12.714
Noodles? You're gonna hurt yourself.

27:12.923 --> 27:15.675
Let me just salvage the situation.
I'll take care of it.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.895
Now, what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

27:34.570 --> 27:38.156
Why don't you tell the fucking IAD suits
to go kiss my ass.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.365
Enough of this bullshit.

27:39.408 --> 27:40.533
We on?

27:42.745 --> 27:43.911
- Nicky?
- What?

27:43.954 --> 27:44.954
Game time.

27:45.039 --> 27:47.248
All right, we're on, we're on, Cap.
I'll call you later.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.042
Action.

27:50.627 --> 27:53.713
- Now, what did Ollie have to say?
- You don't wanna know, Charlie.

27:53.756 --> 27:56.132
This is bullshit having to wait this long.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.216
You're gonna be nice?

27:57.259 --> 27:59.969
Yeah. I'm gonna be nice.
I'm gonna be nice, all right?

28:00.054 --> 28:01.763
I just hope they've got a Nip
in this building

28:01.805 --> 28:03.306
that speaks fucking English.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.353
Assistant Inspector
Matsumoto Masahiro,

28:08.437 --> 28:11.939
Criminal Investigation Section,
Osaka Prefectural Police.

28:13.567 --> 28:16.027
And I do speak fucking English.

28:21.450 --> 28:22.700
Would you ask the superintendent

28:22.785 --> 28:25.495
were there any witnesses
at the airport, please?

28:33.045 --> 28:36.047
The superintendent said it's possible.

28:37.925 --> 28:41.135
Yeah, it's possible.
Manned space flight's possible.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.303
"Manned space" what?

28:42.346 --> 28:44.597
- Am I missing something here?
- Everything, kid.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.058
He says he's tired from the flying.
Jet lag.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.601
Can I get some coffee, please?
You want...

28:48.644 --> 28:50.144
- Two coffees.
- Coffee it is.

28:50.187 --> 28:52.146
We are wasting
valuable time here, okay?

28:52.189 --> 28:54.273
Now, if you tell us who this Sayto guy is,

28:54.316 --> 28:55.817
what the meet was about in New York,

28:55.901 --> 28:58.277
then maybe we can help you
with this airport thing.

28:59.113 --> 29:01.823
Did you translate every word?
I want every word translated.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.200
- You understand?
- Yes, I understand.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.506
Because of your negligence,

29:18.549 --> 29:21.259
a man we've wanted for a long time
has been lost.

29:21.343 --> 29:25.012
You do not have to drink tea,
but you should apologise.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.557
Our negligence, huh?

29:28.183 --> 29:30.935
Did we let the people
carrying your documents,

29:31.019 --> 29:33.729
wearing your uniforms,
waltz into a secure area?

29:35.691 --> 29:39.193
Look, we'll take some of the heat
for this, but we're not taking the rap.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.862
- Rap?
- The...

29:41.155 --> 29:44.031
- The bite, the fall. Come on, Charlie.
- Try blame.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.616
Blame, blame, blame.

29:49.705 --> 29:52.874
This document is an insurance policy.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.792
The guy speaks English.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.587
The police will find you a...

29:57.671 --> 29:59.547
- Superintendent Ohashi...
- Hey, we are the police, Charlie.

29:59.590 --> 30:03.301
You are foreigners,
nothing more than interested observers.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.386
Go home, Detective.

30:06.430 --> 30:09.474
You know, I'm about an uptown minute
of throwing you an international incident

30:09.558 --> 30:11.309
that's gonna make your head spin.

30:11.393 --> 30:14.937
Until you sign off on this dickhead,
his ass is mine.

30:17.232 --> 30:20.109
So we either work on this thing together
or I'm going to the press,

30:20.194 --> 30:22.862
I'm going to the embassy...
I'm gonna fire up such a shit storm

30:22.905 --> 30:24.655
you're gonna wish
you never heard my name!

30:24.740 --> 30:28.993
- All right, gentlemen. You can stay.
- Thank you.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.120
By the way, you have to leave your guns.

30:31.205 --> 30:32.914
Hey, Superintendent,
we are police officers.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.665
You are civilians here.

30:35.751 --> 30:38.419
It is illegal for you to carry a gun.

30:38.462 --> 30:39.670
- That's bullshit. What are you...
- We understand.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.214
Nicky, the gun.

30:43.842 --> 30:47.303
- Happy?
- All your guns, gentlemen.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.139
The wise guy.

30:50.224 --> 30:52.141
All right, you assign us a cop
who speaks English,

30:52.226 --> 30:55.144
knows his way around the streets
and can find his ass with two hands.

30:55.229 --> 30:56.270
What?

30:56.522 --> 30:59.524
He wants to say
he wants a tough motherfucker.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.485
- Of course, Detective.
- Good.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.780
- You will have one of our top officers.
- Thank you.

31:08.408 --> 31:11.410
We're in good shape here. Either that
or he's working on the dinner menu.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.706
It's been a gas, chief. Sayonara.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.959
Hey, where's our cop?

31:19.127 --> 31:20.753
It is my honour.

31:53.495 --> 31:55.746
Stay close, please, Detectives.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.589
Can we take...
Can we take a look at him?

32:46.673 --> 32:47.923
Just a moment.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.427
Yes, please.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.306
This is one of the phoney cops
at the airport.

32:56.141 --> 32:59.101
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.650
He's got no defensive wounds.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.610
Nice, clean, right-handed cut.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.197
And he's a fresh puppy.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.908
Perpetrator could be wet.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.036
Look at this.

33:19.414 --> 33:22.249
Nice. Maybe he's got two fives for a ten.

33:26.922 --> 33:30.299
Superintendent thanks you very much.
We should go.

33:31.134 --> 33:32.510
Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait.

33:32.594 --> 33:35.763
You wanna tell us what's going on?
I mean, fill us in.

33:35.847 --> 33:39.058
- Sato doing his own guy or what?
- Please, don't interfere.

33:39.101 --> 33:40.976
I've been ordered
to take you to your hotel.

33:41.061 --> 33:43.145
I am not interfering.
This is what I do for a job.

33:43.230 --> 33:44.563
What do I look like, chopped liver?

33:44.606 --> 33:46.816
Nicky, we're gonna get more
from a quiet look around than a fight.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.651
You are just observers.

33:48.902 --> 33:52.571
I usually get kissed before I get fucked.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.033
What did he say?

33:56.118 --> 33:59.745
Foreplay. He likes a little foreplay.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.445
- Detective!
- Mas, relax.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.572
He's not gonna break anything
he can't pay for.

34:40.495 --> 34:44.123
You gotta put peroxide on that.
That'll get rid of the bloodstain.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.127
- What are you?
- Detective Sergeant Conklin,

34:48.170 --> 34:49.920
Homicide, New York.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.880
So, how'd you get that blood?

34:53.341 --> 34:57.136
The girls wanna know if you're the guy
that lost Sato at the airport.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.056
Just off the plane,
you make the evening news.

35:01.349 --> 35:02.725
Very impressive.

35:04.144 --> 35:06.520
Americans who are less than perfect,
it's very amusing to them.

35:06.563 --> 35:09.023
Could I talk to you for a minute, please?

35:12.027 --> 35:14.737
You still didn't tell me
how you got the blood.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.531
The girl who found the body
was just a little bit upset.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.033
So I put my arms around her.

35:19.075 --> 35:20.159
- Wouldn't you?
- Yeah.

35:20.202 --> 35:21.869
- You got a cigarette?
- Sure.

35:21.912 --> 35:25.539
- Where you from? You from Boston?
- Chicago.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.375
Where'd you learn
how to speak Japanese?

35:28.460 --> 35:29.627
Chicago.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.546
So, did you know the victim?

35:35.050 --> 35:38.093
A couple guys came in here for a drink
and this is how it turned out.

35:38.178 --> 35:41.055
How about the killer?
Did you see the killer leave?

35:41.306 --> 35:44.058
Yeah, sure, and he wrote
his name and address down

35:44.100 --> 35:47.394
on the back of my dress
and he asked me to give it to you.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.479
Anything else?

35:48.563 --> 35:50.564
What are you busting my ass for?

35:51.399 --> 35:53.442
'Cause you could
get me killed, Detective.

35:53.527 --> 35:57.154
You see, there's a war going on here
and they don't take prisoners.

35:57.239 --> 35:58.864
What are you talking about?

35:58.907 --> 36:02.368
Between Sato and an old-time boss,
a guy named Sugai.

36:02.410 --> 36:03.953
Who knows about this?

36:04.538 --> 36:06.413
- Counting you and me?
- Yeah.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.082
Eleven million.

36:15.590 --> 36:18.592
Did that woman tell you anything,
Detective Conklin?

36:18.635 --> 36:20.386
Why the hell
would she tell me anything?

36:20.428 --> 36:22.179
I'm an observer.

36:22.681 --> 36:26.350
You tell Ohashi I'll report to him
when he's ready to report to me.

36:27.894 --> 36:30.729
I'm a police officer
just like you, Detective.

36:30.772 --> 36:32.439
Bullshit. You're a suit.

36:32.691 --> 36:36.026
Go tell Ohashi one good hand job
deserves another.

36:36.444 --> 36:37.862
I don't understand.

36:37.946 --> 36:39.113
Mas...

36:40.115 --> 36:44.451
Hey, Charlie, get your map out, will you,
babe? Find the directions to the hotel.

36:45.495 --> 36:48.122
- Don't you want a ride?
- We'll walk.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.958
What I want is a complete file
on Sato, all right?

36:51.001 --> 36:52.960
A full report
on what the hell happened here tonight

36:53.044 --> 36:57.965
and all other relevant information to
this case translated by 0900 tomorrow.

36:58.300 --> 37:01.010
- You got that, Matsumoto?
- Very well.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.553
Well, thank you.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.472
Let's go, Charlie. Come on.

37:05.974 --> 37:08.142
You'll have a long walk home.

37:08.184 --> 37:10.769
Fine. If I get lost, we'll call a cop.

37:13.523 --> 37:14.648
What?

37:25.994 --> 37:28.454
I mean, I like the guy.
I mean, I don't know why they wouldn't

37:28.496 --> 37:30.956
fill us in on a simple gang war,
but I like the guy.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.124
So, what's happening, baby?

37:32.167 --> 37:34.168
Tell me in four blocks,
we're walking 20 minutes here.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.921
Now, wait a second,
Mr We'll-Walk-Home-To-The-Hotel.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.173
What do I look like?
I work at the fucking UN?

37:39.257 --> 37:41.759
You got no idea
where the goddamn hotel is.

37:42.052 --> 37:44.053
Mr Conklin, is this an appropriate time
to ask you

37:44.137 --> 37:46.096
what's going down with Oliver?

37:47.807 --> 37:51.852
Yeah, some suits back home
think I cut a deal with Sato.

37:52.228 --> 37:53.687
They're full of shit.

37:53.730 --> 37:55.439
Hey, they're gonna believe
what they wanna believe.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.858
Well, don't worry about it.
I'll back you up.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.944
What the hell's going on here?

38:32.102 --> 38:34.103
What? What?

38:35.897 --> 38:37.398
What's your problem?

38:53.331 --> 38:54.832
I don't know, Nicky.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.875
Something tells me
we should cut our losses

38:56.918 --> 38:59.420
and let the locals handle it around here.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.381
I can't go back without him, Charlie.

39:08.388 --> 39:09.680
Sato Koji.

39:10.056 --> 39:14.476
He started young and rose quickly,
from street enforcer to minor boss.

39:15.770 --> 39:19.314
He controlled some of the docks
and some construction in Hawaii.

39:22.110 --> 39:25.112
Okay. Victim last night
was one of Sayto's guys, right?

39:25.155 --> 39:26.447
- Right.
- Sato's.

39:26.489 --> 39:27.614
Sato, right.

39:27.657 --> 39:31.577
And six hours earlier, he's suspected
of putting a hit on this guy...

39:33.872 --> 39:37.624
Okada Genkuro, damascene maker.
An artist.

39:37.709 --> 39:38.751
He's an engraver.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.378
Forty-eight hours later,
he's snapping caps at Scalari's.

39:41.463 --> 39:44.173
Masa, who's the monkey here
with Sayto?

39:44.257 --> 39:45.424
Sato.

39:45.467 --> 39:46.800
Sato, Sayto.

39:47.802 --> 39:50.471
Sugai Kunio, top oyabun.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.723
Like your mafia bosses.

39:52.807 --> 39:56.268
Construction, gambling, extortion.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.854
What's Sugai doing with Sayto?

39:58.938 --> 40:01.315
- I don't know.
- I don't believe...

40:01.399 --> 40:03.150
Wait, wait. Mas, wait one second.

40:03.193 --> 40:06.361
Look, even I know that Sayto
used to be the lieutenant for Sugai.

40:06.446 --> 40:08.906
Now there's a war going on
between the two of them.

40:08.990 --> 40:11.492
I mean, they're knocking each other off
left and right.

40:11.576 --> 40:13.786
Oh, these goddamn suits, man.

40:17.707 --> 40:20.334
Mas, what's with the SWATs out here?

40:20.460 --> 40:21.710
Exercise.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.337
Exercise?

40:23.671 --> 40:25.672
- Training, perhaps.
- Come on, Mas.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.341
You're gonna have
to start cutting us in here.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.842
The thing is, Charlie, I can't figure out

40:28.927 --> 40:31.053
what's in that box at Scalari's,
you know?

40:31.137 --> 40:34.098
- This guy Sugai into drugs?
- No drugs.

40:34.224 --> 40:36.725
- Steel. Liquor.
- Nicky.

40:38.394 --> 40:41.438
Horses. He owns part of Club Miyako.

40:48.196 --> 40:50.280
- Matsumoto.
- Yes.

40:50.490 --> 40:52.366
What's going on outside?

40:52.534 --> 40:55.327
They have a tip
about Sato's last hide-out.

40:55.370 --> 40:56.870
- Oh, they have a tip.
- They got a tip.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.706
- It's only a tip.
- It's only a tip, Nick.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.334
I promise I will keep you informed,
okay?

41:02.377 --> 41:03.544
- You promise?
- Yes.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.045
- That's good enough.
- All right.

41:05.672 --> 41:08.715
You got that file on Sato's guy...

41:09.259 --> 41:11.385
- Sekimitsu? Yes, sir.
- Sekimitsu. Yes.

41:11.427 --> 41:12.553
Yeah. Good.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.225
Police observers!

41:18.309 --> 41:20.310
It's okay! It's okay!

41:21.813 --> 41:23.438
Please. I need authorisation.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.941
No. It's only a tip, Mas.
It's only a tip. Come on.

41:26.109 --> 41:27.234
Let's go! Let's all tip!

41:27.277 --> 41:28.318
Training exercise.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.907
- Observers!
- You got it.

42:38.056 --> 42:39.973
- Observers!
- Okay, okay.

42:52.737 --> 42:55.239
Isn't that the guy from the airport?

43:03.790 --> 43:06.500
- That's one of the guys, right?
- Yeah, it's him.

43:15.009 --> 43:16.426
Easy, Nicky.

43:23.810 --> 43:25.185
Hi, sweetheart.

43:28.648 --> 43:30.732
You remember me, don't you?

43:31.609 --> 43:33.360
So where's your boss?

43:43.454 --> 43:44.579
Nicky, what are you doing?

43:44.664 --> 43:46.707
- I only wanna talk to the man...
- What are you doing?

43:46.749 --> 43:48.166
...for five minutes. That's all I wanna do.

43:48.209 --> 43:51.295
It's not proper. It's not proper.
You're a foreigner.

43:51.546 --> 43:53.588
This isn't New York.
We have rules here.

43:53.673 --> 43:55.382
You have rules here, huh?
Hey, look, pal,

43:55.466 --> 43:58.427
I've seen Sato's work, okay?
He ain't following your programme.

43:58.511 --> 44:01.430
- You must learn patience.
- Oh, fuck patience.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.070
He was here.

44:18.114 --> 44:19.489
I know it.

44:29.751 --> 44:31.877
Gentlemen, we have to go.

44:32.086 --> 44:35.130
We're observing, Mas. Just observing.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.424
Can I take a quick look?

45:36.609 --> 45:37.818
Charlie.

45:46.661 --> 45:48.995
- You get something?
- Yeah, I got something.

45:49.038 --> 45:51.373
We gotta share it with Mas.
He's in deep shit with his boss.

45:51.457 --> 45:52.457
Okay.

46:12.562 --> 46:13.979
You don't want to eat that shit, do you?

46:14.021 --> 46:16.440
- Put it there.
- Hand me that stick.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.236
Son of a bitch.

46:23.030 --> 46:24.865
Always said you're the best.

46:25.032 --> 46:27.367
- I owe you lunch, babe.
- Okay, babe.

47:00.067 --> 47:01.443
Where's Mas?

47:04.739 --> 47:06.239
Hey! Mas!

47:06.574 --> 47:08.575
We got good news for you, babe.

47:09.410 --> 47:11.244
What the fuck's his problem?

47:21.255 --> 47:23.590
I will have no more to do with you.

47:23.966 --> 47:25.258
Please get out.

47:27.261 --> 47:29.846
Look, what are you talking about?
I know you took a little heat

47:29.931 --> 47:31.014
for taking us on the raid...

47:31.098 --> 47:32.432
Superintendent Ohashi is
waiting for you.

47:32.475 --> 47:34.935
We understand. We're gonna
square you with Ohashi, Mas.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.937
Let us explain what happened.

47:37.271 --> 47:40.065
You've dishonoured me
and our department.

47:41.442 --> 47:43.068
You are a thief.

47:48.449 --> 47:50.408
I saw you take the money.

47:54.705 --> 47:56.706
You saw me take the money, huh?

47:57.291 --> 48:00.877
You know what it's like trying
to get something done around here.

48:00.962 --> 48:03.129
I've informed Ohashi of your crime.

48:03.214 --> 48:05.715
He has spoken to your captain
in New York.

48:05.925 --> 48:07.926
We know the kind of man you are.

48:07.969 --> 48:11.179
You dumb fuck! You don't know
one thing about me, all right? Listen!

48:11.639 --> 48:13.807
It's you and your self-righteous
bullshit, man,

48:13.891 --> 48:15.350
it's gonna cost me my goddamn job.

48:15.434 --> 48:17.143
Hey! Hey! I'm talking to you!

48:25.278 --> 48:27.946
If you pull it, you better use it.

48:31.867 --> 48:33.868
All right. Watch this, okay?

48:34.495 --> 48:36.329
I only want to do this once.

48:40.501 --> 48:42.544
All right. Look at this. Come here. Look.

48:42.628 --> 48:45.171
See how the impression part
leaves the ashes?

48:45.256 --> 48:47.007
It's because there wasn't
enough pressure.

48:47.091 --> 48:48.174
It should be higher.

48:48.217 --> 48:50.885
Now, this is good.
This is as good as it comes,

48:50.970 --> 48:52.178
but this ain't money.

48:52.263 --> 48:53.847
I don't know about the box at the club.

48:53.889 --> 48:56.224
Could've been samples,
could've been plates,

48:56.309 --> 48:58.643
but you guys got
a counterfeiting war going on.

48:58.686 --> 49:02.939
And you, pal, should talk to your partner
before you go to the suits, okay?

49:03.274 --> 49:04.899
So, fuck you very much.

49:06.193 --> 49:08.695
We were gonna cut you
in on the deal, Mas.

49:40.353 --> 49:42.395
Don't say you never had a good time.

49:42.438 --> 49:44.898
Don't say you never had a good time
with Charlie Vincent.

49:44.982 --> 49:46.691
All right! Kanpai, guys!

49:51.072 --> 49:52.447
Where's that American girl?

49:52.531 --> 49:54.032
You know, the American girl
that was here,

49:54.075 --> 49:56.493
you know, the one that was here.
Is she around tonight? You know, the...

49:56.577 --> 49:57.661
Mas!

49:58.996 --> 50:00.372
Come here, baby.

50:00.915 --> 50:03.917
Join us! Come on!

50:09.840 --> 50:12.759
Oh, baby, what is it?
It's still moving in my mouth.

50:13.969 --> 50:14.969
Good evening.

50:15.054 --> 50:16.846
Matsumoto the Mountie, huh?

50:16.931 --> 50:18.682
I haven't taken the silverware,
babe, all right?

50:18.766 --> 50:20.100
So why don't you just go take a hike.

50:20.142 --> 50:23.687
Come on, Nicky, what are you doing?
Mas, sit down. Join us.

50:24.438 --> 50:27.148
Superintendent Ohashi
would like to see you in the morning.

50:27.233 --> 50:29.067
Superintendent Ohashi
would like to see me.

50:29.110 --> 50:30.485
Give me a break.

50:32.279 --> 50:35.448
Mas, can you smoke
a little peace pipe here, guys?

50:35.533 --> 50:37.659
Everybody was doing
the right thing, right?

50:37.743 --> 50:41.162
We're all partners now.
Mas, please join us.

50:41.288 --> 50:44.374
Relax and have a good time.
Please, sit down.

50:44.458 --> 50:45.917
Come on, Mas.

50:46.669 --> 50:48.002
Thank you.

50:50.089 --> 50:52.340
Masahiro Matsumoto,
a famous detective!

50:52.425 --> 50:54.050
Famous detective!

50:57.972 --> 51:00.807
Conklin, I did my duty.

51:02.393 --> 51:03.935
These are the men I work for.

51:03.978 --> 51:05.311
Like I told you, pal,

51:05.396 --> 51:08.440
you talk to your partners first
before you go to the suits.

51:08.482 --> 51:09.983
- Okay?
- Come on, Nicky.

51:10.025 --> 51:13.319
Perhaps you should think
less of yourself and more of your group.

51:13.404 --> 51:15.572
Try to work like a Japanese.

51:16.240 --> 51:20.243
Listen. I grew up with your soldiers.
You were wise then.

51:20.661 --> 51:24.914
Now, music and movies
are all America is good for!

51:24.999 --> 51:28.084
Right? We make the machines.

51:28.169 --> 51:31.880
We built the future. We won the peace.

51:31.964 --> 51:33.757
And if there was one of you guys

51:33.841 --> 51:36.551
who had an original idea,
you'd be so tight

51:36.635 --> 51:38.428
you couldn't even pull it out of your ass!

51:38.512 --> 51:40.013
What the hell's going on here?
What are you guys?

51:40.097 --> 51:42.015
You got to argue all the time?

51:42.516 --> 51:44.309
- See you later.
- Come on, Nicky.

51:44.351 --> 51:47.103
What is this?
A conspiracy to fuck up my evening?

51:47.188 --> 51:49.314
What the hell's the problem here?

51:50.316 --> 51:51.858
Mas, what are you doing?

51:51.942 --> 51:53.943
This is good-time time, Mas. Okay?

51:54.028 --> 51:55.361
You know, kanpai time?

51:56.530 --> 51:58.865
- Up and down, huh?
- Up and down! In and out!

51:58.908 --> 52:01.534
Okay, kanpai.

52:19.136 --> 52:20.929
- Joyce.
- Can I talk to you, please?

52:22.765 --> 52:23.973
Jesus.

52:24.058 --> 52:25.600
All right, Chicago, look,
I need some help, all right?

52:25.684 --> 52:28.436
My tit's in the ringer.
I don't speak the goddamn language.

52:28.521 --> 52:30.563
So give me a couple minutes.

52:33.234 --> 52:34.567
You see that woman down there?

52:34.610 --> 52:36.778
You give her $50
and you go where she takes you.

52:36.862 --> 52:38.571
Then I'll find you.

52:52.503 --> 52:53.586
Hey, babe!

52:54.171 --> 52:55.338
Can we get a little mercy here?

52:55.422 --> 52:58.383
Some people are trying to eat.
Thank you very much.

52:58.592 --> 53:00.385
You like this stuff, huh, Mas?

53:00.427 --> 53:02.095
- Yes.
- Yes?

53:02.555 --> 53:05.139
- That's Amore.
- That's Amore!

53:05.224 --> 53:07.433
I was a teenager when it was new.

53:07.476 --> 53:10.895
And I was a teenager
when it was old, Mas.

53:10.980 --> 53:12.981
If you're gonna hang around
with the NYPD, Mas,

53:13.065 --> 53:15.859
- there's one thing you gotta do for me.
- What?

53:16.652 --> 53:20.071
You're gonna have to lose
the Kmart tie, babe. It's a fire hazard.

53:20.155 --> 53:23.741
I'm gonna give you a little gift,
straight from the Big Apple.

53:24.410 --> 53:26.786
From Charlie Vincent to you.

53:30.291 --> 53:32.333
- Thanks.
- It's my honour.

53:34.295 --> 53:35.670
I like you.

53:37.506 --> 53:38.715
Top-drawer, yes!

53:38.799 --> 53:40.925
Top-drawer, yes. Top-drawer, no?

53:42.761 --> 53:44.137
Hey, meatball! What are you doing?

53:44.221 --> 53:46.639
If you can't hit the note,
throw your hat on it, babe.

53:48.851 --> 53:51.644
- You could do better?
- I cannot tell a lie.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.438
Yes, I could do better.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.315
Then put it up or shut it up.

53:55.399 --> 53:56.983
For you, from me.

54:04.992 --> 54:06.159
Thank you.

54:06.243 --> 54:08.036
Don't quit your day job.

54:16.462 --> 54:17.837
That quick?

54:18.005 --> 54:19.672
What you talkin' 'bout?

54:22.551 --> 54:23.593
Hey!

54:26.180 --> 54:27.847
Hey, What'd I Say babe!

54:28.390 --> 54:29.724
Look at me, Mas.

54:45.366 --> 54:47.116
- Ray Charles!
- Yes!

54:49.203 --> 54:50.370
You and me!

54:53.332 --> 54:54.707
Detective, wait!

54:56.543 --> 54:58.461
Masahiro Matsumoto,
ladies and gentlemen!

55:02.508 --> 55:04.175
You and me, baby.

55:26.740 --> 55:28.992
Masahiro Matsumoto,
ladies and gentlemen!

55:29.076 --> 55:30.994
Osaka Prefectural Police Department!

55:31.412 --> 55:33.204
If you're looking for Sato,

55:33.747 --> 55:35.081
I can't help you.

55:35.457 --> 55:38.626
He hasn't been here in over a year.

55:39.253 --> 55:40.962
Who would he do regularly?

55:41.046 --> 55:43.256
And what makes you think
I pay attention?

55:43.340 --> 55:46.884
Honey, I think you'd recognise if one
of your customers had a different tie on.

55:52.224 --> 55:54.517
He had a different girl every time

55:54.977 --> 55:57.061
and I don't know
who he's doing regularly.

55:57.104 --> 55:59.313
- Lf that's where you're heading.
- Is that Sugai,

55:59.398 --> 56:01.190
- the one going at it with Sato?
- Right.

56:01.275 --> 56:03.776
And the girl with sequins
had blood on her hands.

56:03.819 --> 56:07.071
- You did your homework.
- All right. How do I get to him?

56:08.282 --> 56:09.490
Look,

56:10.325 --> 56:13.453
I've been living in this country
for seven years

56:13.495 --> 56:15.496
and I still can't read the headlines.

56:15.581 --> 56:17.749
Yes means no, maybe means never.

56:17.791 --> 56:20.376
You didn't answer my question.
How do I get to him?

56:20.461 --> 56:22.754
Let the police handle it.

56:23.589 --> 56:25.715
- No one's gonna help a gaijin.
- Gaijin?

56:25.799 --> 56:28.384
Yeah, a stranger,
a barbarian, a foreigner.

56:28.469 --> 56:29.802
Me and you.

56:30.387 --> 56:31.637
More you.

56:40.522 --> 56:42.857
- Gotta go.
- Chicago, wait. Hold on.

56:42.941 --> 56:46.069
You know, they got lights out there,
Wrigley Field now, you know?

56:46.153 --> 56:47.779
Yeah. Mom told me.

56:47.821 --> 56:48.821
Did she?

56:49.031 --> 56:51.157
She say it's not stupid to be scared?

56:51.200 --> 56:53.451
But you just can't stand still,

56:53.577 --> 56:56.996
and sometimes
you got to choose a side.

56:58.248 --> 56:59.415
I did.

56:59.958 --> 57:01.584
I'm on my side.

57:32.282 --> 57:35.201
- All right, drinks cost $125.
- 125 bucks.

57:35.410 --> 57:37.995
- How about the fish?
- 200 bucks.

57:38.789 --> 57:41.040
200 bucks! Holy shit!

57:41.333 --> 57:43.209
How much do you think
it'd cost if it was cooked?

57:44.044 --> 57:45.545
- Did you pay for it?
- No.

57:45.587 --> 57:48.047
Assistant Inspector
Masahiro Matsumoto

57:48.132 --> 57:51.884
signed it over to the
Osaka Prefectural Police Department.

57:51.927 --> 57:53.553
Best thing they've done for us
since we've been here.

57:53.595 --> 57:54.929
We was owed.

57:55.013 --> 57:56.597
You like this guy, huh?

57:56.682 --> 57:57.890
- Mas?
- Yeah.

57:58.058 --> 57:59.142
He's okay.

57:59.434 --> 58:00.935
What the hell's this?

58:04.064 --> 58:05.356
Come on, baby.

58:08.235 --> 58:11.195
I don't know, Charlie.
I can't figure this place out.

58:13.907 --> 58:16.909
Come out, babe. You want to play?
You and me. Come on.

58:17.744 --> 58:20.037
Come on. Right here.
Come on. Come on.

58:21.081 --> 58:23.166
That's it. That's it. Come on. Right here.

58:23.250 --> 58:24.584
Hey! Fuck!

58:24.626 --> 58:26.460
- Good, Charlie.
- Fuck me.

58:26.545 --> 58:29.255
- Good move, babe.
- Hey! Hey!

58:31.466 --> 58:33.843
- Real good, Charlie.
- Okay, good. Come on.

58:33.927 --> 58:35.595
Bring it back. We'll go again.

58:36.847 --> 58:38.264
You, bring it back.

58:39.933 --> 58:42.435
- Did you see that?
- Don't get fucking personal, all right?

58:42.477 --> 58:44.061
- Hey, fuck you!
- Hey!

58:44.104 --> 58:45.605
- Hey, Charlie.
- Fuck!

58:45.898 --> 58:48.608
Hey, Charlie, come on,
it's only a goddamn coat!

58:48.692 --> 58:50.526
He's got my fucking passport!

58:50.611 --> 58:53.946
- Come here, you little fuck! Come here!
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

58:55.073 --> 58:57.950
Come here, you fuck.
Come here! Come here!

59:00.621 --> 59:02.955
Hey, Charlie! Charlie!

59:05.459 --> 59:06.667
Charlie!

59:19.181 --> 59:20.389
You little shit!

59:35.155 --> 59:36.489
Hey, Charlie!

59:39.743 --> 59:41.285
Come here! Come here!

59:43.288 --> 59:44.330
Fuck!

59:50.462 --> 59:51.545
Oh!

59:51.630 --> 59:54.215
Oh, you little shit!

59:55.884 --> 59:58.052
Stay there, you little shit! Right there!

59:58.136 --> 59:59.470
Stay right there!

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.973
Oh, you little shit!

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:06.352
Oh, oh, you fuck. All right.

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.776
Come on, babe! Let's go!

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.164
Shit!

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:38.801
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:40.594
Come on.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:44.056
Come on! Who's first?

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:45.850
Come on!

01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:49.562
Charlie!

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:52.898
Get out of there, Charlie!

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.782
Get out of there! Get away!

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:04.535
Charlie!

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:10.791
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:17.048
You fuck!

01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:31.771
Charlie!

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.314
Get out of there!

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:41.447
Charlie!

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:40.673
You better come with me. Come on.

01:03:09.244 --> 01:03:11.370
He should have known better. He...

01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:16.709
He was raised in the city and...

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:21.672
See, my job...

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:26.218
You kind of see things
the way they really are.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:32.641
You don't have to see a person
whole one minute and...

01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:42.568
He was 28 years old.

01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:46.674
May I speak to Nick-san alone?

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:52.471
Sure.

01:05:03.775 --> 01:05:05.651
I'm very sorry for your loss.

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:12.241
I thought maybe you should know.

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:15.744
I made all arrangements for Charlie.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:19.582
Thank you.

01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:23.043
I feel... I feel that

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:27.756
if I had been with you,

01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:30.342
Charlie-san would...

01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:34.680
It would not have happened.

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:39.184
I'm very sorry.

01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:47.276
Charlie's things...

01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:52.072
We have a tradition.

01:05:53.742 --> 01:05:56.243
When someone close to us dies,

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.831
we keep something personal of his.

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.045
Can we do this another time?

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:10.049
Please, Nick-san.

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:37.826
This is for you.

01:07:00.725 --> 01:07:03.352
I can take anything I want?

01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:07.106
Anything.

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:28.293
I wanna go back
to Sato's hide-out, okay?

01:07:29.129 --> 01:07:30.629
Just you and me.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.981
There's always something, Mas.

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:52.151
Always something.

01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:02.953
Yeah.

01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:08.542
He had himself a real nice party.

01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:40.866
You feel safe?

01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:46.705
Well, feel safe!

01:08:48.166 --> 01:08:49.291
I'm here!

01:08:49.501 --> 01:08:50.501
Let's get this thing...

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:15.234
Nick-san, there's nothing here.

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:21.113
We should go.

01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:51.103
Masa.

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:55.649
Sequins.

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.285
Okay, here we go.

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:30.934
How can you be so sure?
It could be any girl's dress.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.772
Sometimes you gotta forget your head
and grab your balls.

01:10:37.358 --> 01:10:38.400
Balls?

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:41.069
- Balls.
- Balls.

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:44.031
Come on, hot dog.
You're going to lose her. Come on.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:06.011
All right. Let's keep in touch.

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:49.179
- All right. Masa, Masa, come in.
- Roger.

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:51.431
I got her.
She's on the other side of the market.

01:11:51.516 --> 01:11:52.975
I want you to bring the wheels around.

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:13.829
- Good?
- Oh, yeah. This is great. Yeah.

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:16.873
Pepper?

01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:19.167
Oh, yeah. Thanks, yeah.

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:34.266
Oh, yeah?

01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:41.398
Yeah.

01:12:46.404 --> 01:12:48.196
Big shot from New York, huh?

01:12:55.997 --> 01:12:58.749
- Nick-san.
- Yeah?

01:13:00.084 --> 01:13:01.585
There's something...

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:03.420
Maybe I should not ask.

01:13:03.463 --> 01:13:05.464
What? What? You can ask me
anything you want, Masa.

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:07.299
What do you wanna know?

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:12.345
These disturbing things
I hear about you in New York.

01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:21.229
A couple of guys
I used to work with in the department

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:24.191
took some money
from some drug dealers.

01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:26.276
It's no big deal.

01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:30.322
They stole?

01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:35.827
They... They liberated funds.

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:42.501
Theft is theft. There is no grey area.

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:47.297
Hey, Masa,
New York is one big grey area, okay?

01:13:53.805 --> 01:13:55.263
Did you take money?

01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:06.525
Yeah, I took money.

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.739
I'm not proud of it, okay? You know, I...

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:18.036
I had a divorce, I got kids, bills...

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:29.881
Did Charlie-san know?

01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:33.552
No.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.223
He was a policeman, Nick.

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:42.519
If you steal,

01:14:45.898 --> 01:14:47.274
you disgrace him

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:54.364
and yourself and me.

01:15:06.544 --> 01:15:07.586
Thanks.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.558
Masa, rise and shine, babe.

01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:05.685
We got action.

01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:09.606
She just went into the store over there.

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:13.610
There she goes.

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:19.240
Just a little morning walk.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.016
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:12.103
She's getting a cab. Mas, grab a taxi.

01:18:12.563 --> 01:18:13.605
Taxi!

01:18:19.487 --> 01:18:21.780
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:18:21.822 --> 01:18:23.990
That's the guy that set up Charlie.

01:18:24.784 --> 01:18:26.201
That's the switch.

01:18:29.997 --> 01:18:31.372
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:21.125
You each have one plate.

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:25.588
One for the front of the bill
and one for the back.

01:21:31.136 --> 01:21:33.304
Sato, have you
brought the plate with you?

01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:38.351
It is my only insurance.

01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:41.521
If I had brought the plate,
I would be a dead man.

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:45.066
Better get your cops.

01:21:51.282 --> 01:21:54.659
I sent one of the plates to America...

01:21:56.996 --> 01:22:00.331
to prove the quality
of my engraver's work.

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:03.584
This traitor took it
from my representatives

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:04.794
and then murdered them.

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:08.006
Look at him!

01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:12.844
He knows nothing of loyalty and respect.

01:22:14.555 --> 01:22:17.682
My men respect me, Sugai-san.

01:22:19.226 --> 01:22:20.393
I want my own territory.

01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:32.739
Your methods are crude
and disgraceful.

01:22:35.034 --> 01:22:38.328
You liked my methods well enough

01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:40.163
when they served you.

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:45.043
You must return the plate,
then we can discuss your future.

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:48.838
I want to be an Oyabun...

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:54.552
of equal standing to others...

01:22:56.347 --> 01:22:59.724
and I want my own territory

01:22:59.767 --> 01:23:01.642
far away from you.

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:13.404
Not one Oyabun in all Japan
would listen to such absurd demands.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:15.698
How old are you, Sato?

01:23:17.076 --> 01:23:19.410
Do you want to live a little longer?

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:22.580
Not as long as you, old man!

01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:23.724
Hold it!

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:19.614
Here I am, Nick!

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:21.324
Here!

01:25:21.867 --> 01:25:26.287
Almost as near
as when you let Charlie die, huh?

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:39.110
He's getting away!

01:26:50.247 --> 01:26:53.624
- Jesus!
- I told you, no guns.

01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:55.793
I thought we were working together,
god damn it!

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:57.712
He went right past you!

01:26:57.796 --> 01:27:00.423
Right past you, he went! Jesus Christ!

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:02.508
Look! The guy's getting away!

01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:08.598
Wait. What's going on?

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.017
We are going to put you on a plane.

01:27:11.101 --> 01:27:13.936
Should you return, you'll be arrested.

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:12.411
On behalf of Northwest Airlines,

01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:14.705
I would like to welcome you onboard.

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:18.459
We anticipate an on time departure
for this flight.

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:55.306
Masahiro Matsumoto?

01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:01.479
Thank you.

01:30:07.736 --> 01:30:08.903
Hey, Masa.

01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:11.489
Nick-san.

01:30:12.032 --> 01:30:14.158
Excuse me. Shoes.

01:30:14.993 --> 01:30:16.202
- Shoes.
- Oh.

01:30:18.121 --> 01:30:20.539
It's not possible. You are gone.

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:24.293
You know me. I don't go quietly, Masa.

01:30:25.212 --> 01:30:26.295
Thanks.

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.174
I need your help.

01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:34.845
I'm sorry, but you should not have come.

01:30:34.888 --> 01:30:36.806
You have done enough to him.

01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:08.295
Please pardon my son.

01:31:09.089 --> 01:31:10.339
He came to comfort me,

01:31:10.382 --> 01:31:13.217
but all he does
is show his disappointment.

01:31:13.635 --> 01:31:16.095
You never even told me
you had a son, Mas.

01:31:17.222 --> 01:31:18.556
It doesn't matter.

01:31:22.394 --> 01:31:24.395
I have been suspended, Nick-san.

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:27.898
I am no longer an assistant inspector.

01:31:32.737 --> 01:31:33.946
Oh...

01:31:34.865 --> 01:31:36.240
Jesus Christ.

01:31:38.827 --> 01:31:40.578
- I'm sorry, man. I...
- No!

01:31:41.079 --> 01:31:42.746
I knew what I was doing.

01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:46.375
Well, it's not over yet.

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:50.004
We can get him, Mas, you and me.

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:52.423
I cannot help you.

01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:55.259
- Nick-san, look at me.
- We can fix it, Mas.

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:57.136
You cannot fix everything.

01:31:57.929 --> 01:31:59.513
I am not like you.

01:32:01.641 --> 01:32:04.101
For a moment, I thought I could be.

01:32:04.144 --> 01:32:07.021
You can, all right.
You didn't do anything wrong, okay?

01:32:07.105 --> 01:32:09.565
- We kicked ass.
- It was for nothing.

01:32:09.608 --> 01:32:12.192
- Oh, come on, Masa. Come...
- Nick-san.

01:32:12.277 --> 01:32:14.153
I belong to a group.

01:32:16.489 --> 01:32:18.449
They will not have me anymore.

01:32:20.076 --> 01:32:22.453
You're digging a hole for yourself, Mas.

01:32:25.624 --> 01:32:28.834
Sometimes you got to go for it.

01:32:28.919 --> 01:32:30.127
Get out.

01:32:32.797 --> 01:32:33.881
Please.

01:32:50.815 --> 01:32:54.860
Yeah. Joyce. I want to speak to...
Joyce. Joyce-san. Yeah.

01:33:07.958 --> 01:33:09.500
Where's Sugai, Joyce?

01:33:12.379 --> 01:33:14.129
Can I find him in the bar?

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:17.216
Here's your food. Here's some cash.

01:33:17.926 --> 01:33:19.301
What about Sugai?

01:33:32.732 --> 01:33:34.358
You wanna find Sugai,

01:33:35.151 --> 01:33:37.069
this is where you'll find him.

01:33:37.737 --> 01:33:41.156
He loves golf.
He's here three times a week.

01:33:42.909 --> 01:33:45.035
You always try and get rid of me,

01:33:45.745 --> 01:33:47.371
you know, yet you're...

01:33:48.206 --> 01:33:49.707
You're always there.

01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:53.961
I think sometime we're going to have
to try to figure that one out.

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:58.465
You said you wouldn't give me
any more trouble, remember?

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:02.052
Joyce.

01:34:08.226 --> 01:34:09.893
I know you took a risk.

01:34:12.731 --> 01:34:14.064
Good luck, Nick.

01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:53.771
How you doing, pal?

01:34:53.855 --> 01:34:56.607
I want to talk to your friend Mr Sugai.

01:35:20.090 --> 01:35:22.758
Ask him to give Sugai this.

01:36:24.863 --> 01:36:26.697
What, are we going in there?

01:37:08.948 --> 01:37:13.118
You should be somewhere
over the Pacific now, Conklin.

01:37:14.412 --> 01:37:16.371
We should be rid of you.

01:37:17.624 --> 01:37:21.001
Do you have any idea who I am?

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:23.295
Yeah, I know who you are.

01:37:24.172 --> 01:37:25.214
No.

01:37:25.757 --> 01:37:29.927
If you did,
you wouldn't have given me this.

01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:33.222
Good stuff.

01:37:33.932 --> 01:37:37.226
This is an old bill, a prototype.

01:37:38.061 --> 01:37:41.480
The new ones will be
like everything we make...

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:43.774
Perfect.

01:37:43.858 --> 01:37:45.108
Perfect, huh?

01:37:46.361 --> 01:37:49.071
So, who's going to get the profits? You?

01:37:49.113 --> 01:37:50.364
Or Sato?

01:37:50.949 --> 01:37:53.242
See, I know he's got the other plate.

01:37:54.577 --> 01:37:56.495
That means you've got nothing.

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.748
He might as well be an American.

01:38:01.793 --> 01:38:05.003
His kind respect just one thing,

01:38:05.964 --> 01:38:06.964
money.

01:38:07.048 --> 01:38:09.716
So what are you into it for? Love?

01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:32.114
I was 10

01:38:33.992 --> 01:38:36.368
when the B-29 came.

01:38:37.328 --> 01:38:41.039
My family lived underground
for three days.

01:38:41.958 --> 01:38:44.793
When we came up, the city was gone.

01:38:46.045 --> 01:38:48.547
Then the heat brought rain,

01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:51.216
black rain.

01:38:52.468 --> 01:38:54.511
You made the rain black

01:38:56.389 --> 01:38:59.891
and shoved your values down our throat.

01:39:01.227 --> 01:39:03.812
We forgot who we were.

01:39:04.856 --> 01:39:08.859
You created Sato
and the thousands like him.

01:39:09.819 --> 01:39:11.987
I'm paying you back.

01:39:14.449 --> 01:39:17.868
Hey, you want the plate?
You get me close to him.

01:39:20.872 --> 01:39:22.873
You have no part in this.

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:26.501
I promised the other oyabuns

01:39:26.878 --> 01:39:28.712
there would be peace.

01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:31.548
They don't have to know.

01:39:31.674 --> 01:39:35.385
I'm bound by duty and honour.

01:39:36.679 --> 01:39:38.555
If you had time,

01:39:38.848 --> 01:39:41.516
I would explain what that means.

01:39:42.727 --> 01:39:43.935
Sugai-san.

01:39:45.063 --> 01:39:48.398
I am the solution to your problems.

01:39:49.734 --> 01:39:52.486
I can take him out. Okay?

01:39:53.321 --> 01:39:56.239
I'm nothing but a worthless gaijin

01:39:57.492 --> 01:39:59.910
and everybody knows
he killed my partner.

01:40:00.119 --> 01:40:01.244
Yeah.

01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:04.706
Right in front of you.

01:40:05.124 --> 01:40:06.792
I'm not impressed.

01:40:09.921 --> 01:40:13.924
You get me close, I'll hit the mark

01:40:14.926 --> 01:40:17.219
and you're going to be clean.

01:40:17.261 --> 01:40:19.888
Why should I trust you?

01:40:21.724 --> 01:40:24.059
Because you got nothing to lose.

01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:30.459
Four oyabuns will arrive here shortly

01:41:31.169 --> 01:41:33.170
with their bodyguards.

01:41:34.255 --> 01:41:36.673
Sato will also have a lieutenant.

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:18.144
But sometimes you have to go for it.

01:45:19.355 --> 01:45:20.730
Thanks, pal.

01:45:24.443 --> 01:45:26.027
This is not a farmer.

01:45:26.779 --> 01:45:27.862
What?

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:31.074
This is one of Sato's men.

01:45:33.661 --> 01:45:36.371
He's got his own double cross going on.

01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:39.374
Wonder how many of these other guys
are his men.

01:45:44.839 --> 01:45:46.715
- Okay, I'm going in.
- What?

01:45:46.757 --> 01:45:49.718
I'm going in.
You cover the front, all right?

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:52.679
You can do it. Okay, Mas?
You can do it.

01:47:17.056 --> 01:47:18.681
Sato, sit here.

01:47:38.702 --> 01:47:42.038
You must learn to value
our Yakuza code

01:47:42.122 --> 01:47:44.499
over your individual desires.

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:54.551
If I am granted
the recognition I deserve...

01:47:55.177 --> 01:47:58.847
my loyalty will set a new standard.

01:47:59.557 --> 01:48:01.224
Where's the plate?

01:48:08.107 --> 01:48:09.691
Where's the other plate?

01:48:15.239 --> 01:48:16.698
In a safe place.

01:48:33.299 --> 01:48:34.382
Sato.

01:48:34.925 --> 01:48:38.177
First you must accept responsibility

01:48:38.262 --> 01:48:40.054
for your past deeds...

01:48:41.015 --> 01:48:44.767
by making amends
in the traditional manner.

01:48:49.773 --> 01:48:53.067
If you refuse, there will be no truce!

01:51:13.208 --> 01:51:15.710
Now come sit beside me.

01:51:16.128 --> 01:51:18.129
We will toast our truce.

01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:44.447
Take the cup.

01:52:03.801 --> 01:52:05.051
I got him!

01:52:18.899 --> 01:52:19.982
Shit.

01:57:33.296 --> 01:57:35.840
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:58:02.242 --> 01:58:04.368
- So you made the news again.
- Yeah.

01:58:05.162 --> 01:58:07.037
You're a regular hero.

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:11.041
So, what did you decide?
Are you going to stay here?

01:58:11.251 --> 01:58:12.501
I don't know.

01:58:13.128 --> 01:58:16.297
A love-hate relationship
can last a very long time.

01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:17.965
Yeah.

01:58:21.803 --> 01:58:23.387
I want to thank you.

01:58:24.806 --> 01:58:27.641
- For what?
- For choosing a side.

01:58:36.943 --> 01:58:38.486
You're welcome.

01:58:41.448 --> 01:58:43.240
- Hot pepper?
- No, thanks.

01:58:43.325 --> 01:58:47.369
...Flight 159 for Tokyo
and Washington, D.C.,

01:58:47.787 --> 01:58:50.372
now boarding at Gate 4.

01:58:51.708 --> 01:58:53.959
Come on, don't give me that sad look.

01:58:54.377 --> 01:58:57.713
You know, they never found the plates.

01:58:59.216 --> 01:59:01.759
Not in the house, not in the road.

01:59:02.302 --> 01:59:05.679
Well, some lucky bastard,
he's probably set for life.

01:59:06.306 --> 01:59:08.390
I don't think I understand.

01:59:08.767 --> 01:59:12.311
If you got the two plates
and you know the right people,

01:59:12.395 --> 01:59:14.313
then all your problems are solved.

01:59:15.148 --> 01:59:16.941
I mean, who's ever going to know?

01:59:20.737 --> 01:59:23.906
This is final boarding announcement
for Northwest...

01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:25.699
I'm getting good at this, huh?

01:59:25.742 --> 01:59:30.037
...Flight 26,
service to Detroit and New York,

01:59:30.747 --> 01:59:33.249
please proceed to Gate 5.

01:59:37.837 --> 01:59:39.964
I don't want you coming to the gate,
okay?

01:59:40.048 --> 01:59:41.048
Why?

01:59:41.091 --> 01:59:44.802
Because I know you. You're gonna...
You're going to get sentimental.

01:59:45.762 --> 01:59:47.221
It's embarrassing.

01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:52.935
Nick-san.

01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:57.606
What did you get me? A bento box?

01:59:57.691 --> 02:00:00.150
I can eat it on the airplane
instead of that American shit.

02:00:00.235 --> 02:00:02.152
No. It's for your kids.

02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:04.321
Thanks.

02:00:06.908 --> 02:00:09.577
Oh, I got something here for you.

02:00:19.754 --> 02:00:21.046
No, Nick-san.

02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:23.966
Good friends do this.

02:00:28.305 --> 02:00:30.431
You watch your tail, cowboy.
