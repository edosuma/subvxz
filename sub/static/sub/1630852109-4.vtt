WEBVTT

00:06.200 --> 00:08.960
A NETFLIX SERIES

01:14.680 --> 01:16.880
Are you paid to be such a pain in the ass?

01:24.040 --> 01:26.360
Rolling in three, two…

01:28.120 --> 01:32.240
The other day I found the résumé
I wrote ten or 15 years ago.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.600
I read it and thought,
"Wow, I've done a lot of shit!"

01:35.680 --> 01:38.040
It's the profile
of a very versatile worker.

01:39.280 --> 01:42.120
A young one,
but with many different experiences.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.400
Quality stuff, big jobs…

01:44.480 --> 01:45.960
<i>Houston, we have a problem.</i>

01:46.040 --> 01:49.000
I almost cried, reminiscing
about how versatile I was.

01:49.080 --> 01:51.320
Then I remembered it was all bullshit.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.120
The truth is, nobody ever got back to me,

01:54.200 --> 01:55.520
and the armadillo said…

01:55.600 --> 01:56.960
What the fuck do you care?

01:57.040 --> 01:59.800
Make stuff up so you come across
as a graphic designer.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.080
Someone will buy it.

02:01.160 --> 02:03.680
But what if they call to check?

02:03.760 --> 02:07.040
Just stay in the gray area,
write things that can't be verified.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.200
Such as, you were the art director

02:09.280 --> 02:13.000
in an agency in Jakarta
that was swept away by the tsunami.

02:13.080 --> 02:15.800
Capitalism is gullible,
that's its weak spot.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.280
It doesn't have time to check on everyone.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.040
It's vulnerable…

02:20.120 --> 02:21.320
to bullshitters.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.120
I would send tons of résumés,

02:24.200 --> 02:28.400
and this was the foundation
of the great existential ambivalence

02:28.480 --> 02:30.320
that defined my life.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.040
On one hand, I felt depressed
and I felt like a failure

02:33.120 --> 02:34.960
because obviously nobody ever replied.

02:35.040 --> 02:38.760
I thought that this idea that
you could find a job by sending résumés

02:38.840 --> 02:40.960
was a big fat lie

02:41.040 --> 02:43.040
designed to prevent us from going

02:43.120 --> 02:45.800
on a killing spree
like in <i>Bowling for Columbine.</i>

02:48.720 --> 02:51.200
Maybe that worked once,
but the country has gone stale.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.080
Now you need your mom,

02:53.160 --> 02:55.760
your uncle, or a friend
to introduce you to their boss,

02:55.840 --> 03:00.040
and if he sees you have
the anthropomorphic traits required,

03:00.120 --> 03:01.600
he might park you somewhere,

03:01.680 --> 03:03.560
as long as the others don't hate you.

03:03.640 --> 03:06.000
But I was a sociopath
with useless friends,

03:06.080 --> 03:08.160
my family was full of sociopaths,

03:08.240 --> 03:10.560
and nobody could get me a job,

03:10.640 --> 03:12.840
so I would wait for the temp agency angel

03:12.920 --> 03:14.280
to come visit me.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.280
FULL-TIME JOB

03:15.360 --> 03:17.760
On the other hand, though,

03:17.840 --> 03:19.680
occasionally someone would call me.

03:19.760 --> 03:23.800
Did that make me believe in the system?
Of course not!

03:23.880 --> 03:25.080
I was even more upset!

03:25.160 --> 03:27.080
I had to go for an interview!

03:27.160 --> 03:31.760
And I'd have to smile
or they'd think I was an ungrateful shit.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.920
They'd always offer me jobs
I couldn't care less about, like…

03:35.000 --> 03:38.320
You're the perfect guy
to deliver to opticians

03:38.400 --> 03:41.320
a daily free paper on the underrated risks

03:41.400 --> 03:44.000
of counterfeit sunglasses
sold by cheap street stalls.

03:46.120 --> 03:49.880
I'd spend my time looking for work
to earn a living, but when I found any,

03:49.960 --> 03:52.080
I'd rather kill myself than do it.

03:52.760 --> 03:56.120
Which summarizes the lives
of three billion people on this planet.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.720
One day, Sarah asked me…

03:59.800 --> 04:02.920
You keep sending résumés,
but what do you want to do?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.720
What kind of question is that?

04:04.800 --> 04:07.840
I want a job that pays my rent
and my bills, a normal job.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.440
So why do you moan
about delivering papers?

04:10.520 --> 04:13.360
I wanted to kill myself too
when I started this job.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.000
But I want to be a teacher,

04:15.080 --> 04:17.840
I've been studying all my life for that.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.080
Instead, I sell toilet brushes.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.880
But what is your goal?

04:24.480 --> 04:25.920
That question floors me.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.440
The truth is, I have no goal.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.000
Sending résumés is a pointless exercise

04:30.080 --> 04:32.560
that serves to create an illusion

04:32.640 --> 04:34.840
of being integrated
into our social paradigm.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.480
So if they ask my mom…

04:36.560 --> 04:37.720
What does your son do?

04:37.800 --> 04:38.720
She can say…

04:38.800 --> 04:40.400
He's sending résumés.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.240
Which is better than…

04:42.320 --> 04:45.640
He masturbates like a maniac
and eats 800 plum cakes a day.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.160
But my job search

04:47.240 --> 04:50.240
didn't have a particular goal,
a particular aim.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.640
Subconsciously, I hoped

04:51.720 --> 04:54.920
that sooner or later
a catastrophe would hit us

04:55.000 --> 04:56.160
and someone would say…

04:56.240 --> 04:58.800
All right, this job thing is over.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.360
We're in a new cycle.

05:00.440 --> 05:01.720
We'll go out looting.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.080
For the next 200 years,
this is how we'll earn a living.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.760
We need two more strikers,

05:05.840 --> 05:08.800
a goalkeeper, and someone
comfortable with violence.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.480
I hoped that time would come
before I turned 50

05:13.560 --> 05:14.760
and that someone would ask Mom…

05:14.840 --> 05:17.400
-What does your son do?
-He's sending résumés.

05:17.480 --> 05:20.520
He wants an open space,
so he moved under a bridge.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.160
That's why I sent résumés,

05:22.240 --> 05:23.800
so that I could believe

05:23.880 --> 05:26.120
that my life was still following
the dotted line.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.080
But I refused to look down
because I feared that if I did…

05:29.160 --> 05:30.200
DEGREE - JOB

05:30.280 --> 05:34.360
…I'd see that I had deviated from
the line, that I was tearing randomly,

05:34.440 --> 05:36.680
and that the sheet of paper was a mess.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.440
Only two people could comfort me
when I felt like a failure.

05:42.520 --> 05:44.520
One was Secco. To his credit,

05:44.600 --> 05:48.080
he could make me feel like
a beacon of integration and normality.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.520
You've been fooled.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.080
People stopped working ages ago
after the Industrial Revolution.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.560
Everyone plays online poker.

05:55.640 --> 05:58.160
Enrico, Fat Federico, Cinnamon Man.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.360
You're the only one
who doesn't wanna learn.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.560
Then there was Alice,
who was just like me.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.160
We never told each other, but I know

06:05.240 --> 06:08.480
that she kept studying,
researching, and doing her PhD

06:08.560 --> 06:11.240
because she didn't know what else to do.

06:12.760 --> 06:16.240
She also wanted to believe that
her life was following the dotted line

06:16.320 --> 06:19.920
and kept putting off the time
when she'd have to look down.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.480
<i>You're a piece of shit.</i>

06:22.560 --> 06:25.160
<i>You call me</i>
<i>so that you don't feel like the only loser</i>

06:25.240 --> 06:27.320
<i>who can't find their place in the world.</i>

06:27.400 --> 06:29.160
True, but you're the same.

06:29.240 --> 06:33.240
I remind you that there's someone else
who's adrift with no working compass.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.960
Now that we were older,
we stopped the obvious flirting

06:37.040 --> 06:39.800
and had found what I thought
was a winning balance.

06:39.880 --> 06:40.720
In hindsight,

06:40.800 --> 06:43.920
maybe basing your emotional stability
on someone else's failings

06:44.000 --> 06:45.680
isn't a great strategy.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.400
But when the storm is raging,
you cling to anything.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.520
Well, after 15 years,

07:00.600 --> 07:02.480
I do write comics for a living.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.600
I have my own home.

07:03.680 --> 07:07.000
It's much bigger
than any other home I've lived in,

07:07.080 --> 07:08.600
and my mom says…

07:08.680 --> 07:12.240
It'd be such a nice apartment
if you looked after it.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.200
Your home is like a business card.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.000
If you don't have control over your home,

07:17.080 --> 07:20.040
it means you don't have
control over your life.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.040
And I'd like to tell her…

07:22.120 --> 07:23.960
It's so true, Parent 1.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.240
It's not that I have no control
over the house,

07:26.320 --> 07:27.440
I have no authority.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.600
I only rule over a part of it,

07:29.680 --> 07:31.360
about 70%.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.560
It's quite a lot. More than half.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.880
Sadly, the rest of the territory
is fragmented.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.320
You know how they say…

07:38.400 --> 07:40.360
Tito's regime was tough,

07:40.440 --> 07:43.400
but only he could keep
former Yugoslavia together.

07:43.480 --> 07:44.920
My house is the same.

07:46.080 --> 07:47.200
CALCARE'S HOME

07:47.280 --> 07:51.320
Unfortunately, I wasn't able
to maintain a united front.

07:51.400 --> 07:55.520
Over time, four kingdoms have seceded
and declared their independence.

07:55.600 --> 08:00.160
Each kingdom wants to prevail
and conquer the Sofa of Thrones,

08:00.240 --> 08:03.760
my fortress, laden with pastry crumbs,

08:03.840 --> 08:07.280
and a symbol of power
as it's located in front of the TV.

08:07.800 --> 08:11.240
It's the ideal place
for any human activity.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.520
-Working, eating, sleeping…
-Peeing too.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.880
-If you have a bottle handy.
-Shut up!

08:15.960 --> 08:18.760
One of the claimants to the throne
is Cardboard Castle,

08:18.840 --> 08:21.040
which, once upon a time, was the study,

08:21.120 --> 08:23.000
that mythical extra room

08:23.080 --> 08:25.280
that you don't know what to use for,
so you say…

08:25.360 --> 08:27.240
It'll become the study.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.920
The punishment for having
such a middle-class thought

08:30.000 --> 08:31.960
oozing with hubris

08:32.040 --> 08:33.880
is that, without even noticing,

08:33.960 --> 08:38.080
the room filled up with moving boxes
full of things I don't even remember,

08:38.160 --> 08:40.640
but that I'm sure are totally useless,

08:40.720 --> 08:44.400
since in five years
I've never needed to look for any of them.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.200
I've never said…

08:46.280 --> 08:47.640
Where is that robot dog

08:47.720 --> 08:50.880
that plays "Für Elise" in farts
if you press its tummy?

08:50.960 --> 08:53.560
But clearly it's stuff I can't throw away

08:53.640 --> 08:56.000
as we never know what the future holds.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.560
After coronavirus,
we know that for a fact.

09:01.560 --> 09:05.200
Oh, no! Another dystopic dictatorship
has outlawed music,

09:05.280 --> 09:08.080
destroyed all records,
and banned YouTube and Spotify!

09:08.160 --> 09:12.160
How will we teach our children
the beauty of symphonies?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.480
So the room can't be used.

09:26.560 --> 09:30.320
The boxes must stay as they contain
potential future resources.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.440
Then there's Tangle Trench,

09:32.520 --> 09:35.960
which is next to the TV
and the most dangerous spot in the house.

09:36.040 --> 09:39.160
It's where the cables
for the TV, the VCR, the satellite box,

09:39.240 --> 09:42.520
the DVD player, the PlayStation,
the Nintendo Switch, and the Xbox

09:42.600 --> 09:45.120
all join together in an illogical knot.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.240
I say "illogical" because
the cables shouldn't move,

09:48.320 --> 09:50.960
so nobody knows
how they got so tangled up.

09:51.040 --> 09:54.080
Not even if I consciously tried
to knot them up every day

09:54.160 --> 09:55.760
would I achieve this mess.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.800
I tried disentangling them, once.
Reckless fool!

09:59.880 --> 10:02.120
I pulled on a plug
and the TV fell on top of me.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.120
I couldn't find the PlayStation cable

10:04.200 --> 10:06.520
as they all looked the same.
Exasperated, I thought…

10:06.600 --> 10:10.280
Why did I do this?
I'll never be able to reconnect anything!

10:10.360 --> 10:12.440
A cable was strangling me

10:12.520 --> 10:14.320
and a USB port hissed in my ear…

10:14.400 --> 10:17.400
This is <i>our</i> home.

10:17.480 --> 10:18.880
Get the hell out of here!

10:20.040 --> 10:23.240
I haven't gone there since,
but I can see it growing.

10:23.760 --> 10:27.600
It's eaten up a couple of phone chargers
and the extension cord for the iron.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.960
Then there's Pointless Place.
It was supposed to be a table,

10:33.040 --> 10:35.640
but now it's completely covered
by random objects

10:35.720 --> 10:38.160
attracted by that flat surface.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.880
Clearing it is impossible

10:39.960 --> 10:44.000
as none of those objects
have a place in the house.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.120
If I decide to tidy up,
I see this ceramic chicken and think…

10:47.200 --> 10:48.080
Where do I put it?

10:48.160 --> 10:49.360
Or this plastic ball

10:49.440 --> 10:52.760
that projects a crappy impression
of a starry sky on the ceiling.

10:52.840 --> 10:55.680
I can't put it on top of the microwave.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.040
What about these 14 boxes of nasal spray,

10:59.120 --> 11:01.240
or a wooden dinosaur that was painted

11:01.320 --> 11:04.920
by an exploited seal pup
in an emerging market's zoo?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.680
It's like a giant refugee camp

11:07.760 --> 11:10.800
where all objects with nowhere to go
have found a safe haven.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.760
Once upon a time,
your mom would have said…

11:13.840 --> 11:15.480
Keep the stuff you want to keep,

11:15.560 --> 11:17.920
and the rest goes in the bin!

11:19.040 --> 11:21.160
Your mom was like Marshal Tito,

11:21.240 --> 11:23.480
and you're a tin-hearted hippie.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.840
Whenever I try, at best,
I can move three books to the shelf.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.560
One, actually.
I haven't read these two yet,

11:30.640 --> 11:32.280
so I'll keep them out.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.640
Minor Sofa is the last kingdom.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.640
It's the other sofa, because I thought…

11:36.720 --> 11:37.920
I can create an L shape,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.240
so I can invite lots of people over.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.920
The truth is, I never invite anyone
as I'm such a misanthrope

11:44.000 --> 11:46.280
and this is my cathedral of solitude.

11:46.360 --> 11:49.200
And so, in time, Sofa Two
has collected all sorts of trash.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.600
This gradual invasion is totally my fault
because one day I thought…

11:52.680 --> 11:54.560
I'll put the backpack here,

11:54.640 --> 11:56.680
people can move it if they want.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.080
But what looked like
harmless temporary clutter

12:00.160 --> 12:02.680
kept building new settlements,

12:02.760 --> 12:04.240
and every time I'd say…

12:04.320 --> 12:07.160
According to our treaty,
you could only get up to here.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.480
We've expanded.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.680
There are families there,
we can't evict them.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.720
Let's say the new border is here.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.520
Every day, the same crap.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.680
They kept moving
the border a little further.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.840
Little by little,
the whole sofa is now taken.

12:22.920 --> 12:26.760
And at night, when I drop my guard
after scarfing milk and sweets,

12:26.840 --> 12:29.120
I can see them plotting to conquer…

12:29.200 --> 12:31.160
the Sofa of Thrones.

12:31.240 --> 12:33.560
It gained its name
when I moved the cushions

12:33.640 --> 12:36.600
and I found some old yogurt containers

12:36.680 --> 12:38.640
and 874 pens and pencils,

12:38.720 --> 12:42.160
plus a knife for slicing ham
that I'd lost four years before.

12:42.240 --> 12:45.320
I felt like King Arthur with Excalibur.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.040
Having your life under control

12:48.120 --> 12:50.680
is not some tangible award
you put in a safe

12:50.760 --> 12:52.440
and that can never be taken away.

12:53.680 --> 12:54.840
It's a constant battle,

12:54.920 --> 12:59.480
and you need to defend
every centimeter you earn every day.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.920
Because if you drop your guard,
everything will be taken away.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.080
Rather than giving up my sofa,

13:05.160 --> 13:08.240
I'd give it a Viking burial
and burn the building down.

13:18.160 --> 13:25.040
TODAY 5:58 P.M.
600 KM FROM ROME

13:28.200 --> 13:30.280
Everything is going well,
but I smell of piss,

13:30.360 --> 13:33.560
I'm covered in grease,
I'm as sweaty as a kebab,

13:33.640 --> 13:34.960
and I'm about to get sick

13:35.040 --> 13:37.240
because of the drop in temperature.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.640
I'm freezing cold. It must be a mistake.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.080
Is this the refrigerator car?

13:41.160 --> 13:43.360
It can't be this cold!

13:43.440 --> 13:45.720
Aren't you freezing, guys? Is it just me?

13:45.800 --> 13:48.000
Nothing, they're fast asleep,

13:48.080 --> 13:51.360
unaware of the fact that the train
might be some sort of Noah's Ark

13:51.440 --> 13:52.560
used by a philanthropist

13:52.640 --> 13:55.600
to recreate the polar bear's
natural habitat

13:55.680 --> 13:57.040
before it becomes extinct,

13:57.120 --> 13:59.560
and we are the bear's food.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.640
An old lady makes a clever observation,

14:03.720 --> 14:07.040
probably thanks to her 450 years
on this planet.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.640
It's the AC.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.120
No shit, Sherlock!
It's 800 degrees outside!

14:11.200 --> 14:12.520
I know it's the AC

14:12.600 --> 14:15.600
and a not a portal
that connects the Earth to Pluto.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.760
But there should be a set gap

14:17.840 --> 14:19.680
between outside and inside temperature.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.240
You always need to bring a jacket
on a train.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.600
Such a know-it-all.

14:24.680 --> 14:25.840
A jacket, sure,

14:25.920 --> 14:28.400
but I'd need to wrap myself up
in a wildebeest's fur.

14:28.480 --> 14:31.960
When the heat outside could melt tarmac,

14:32.040 --> 14:34.040
I'd like to be able to board a train

14:34.120 --> 14:36.960
with attire that is compatible with that.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.400
A little bit cooler
so we can breathe, great.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.160
But it shouldn't feel like
entering a parallel world

14:45.240 --> 14:49.440
where life on Earth is about to disappear
because of a new Ice Age!

14:50.480 --> 14:53.760
I'm talking to myself,
as the old lady has fallen asleep too.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.120
What's the point?

14:55.200 --> 14:57.800
Old people have a broken
internal thermostat.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.800
Look at you, all wrapped up

14:59.880 --> 15:02.280
as if Rome in mid-July
was like the tundra.

15:03.280 --> 15:07.320
I can feel the other people judging me
for insulting a harmless old lady.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.560
Or maybe they think I'm exaggerating.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.680
But I can't understand
how they aren't freezing to death.

15:13.720 --> 15:17.120
All right, it's mostly
young Aryan tourist couples.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.920
This is like a sauna for them.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.560
Maybe a Viking lobby bought
the Italian railway system

15:21.640 --> 15:24.160
and now they set the temperature
on all trains.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.400
Whatever, the situation
has become untenable.

15:29.480 --> 15:33.840
I'm going into hypothermia.
Perhaps those around me aren't asleep.

15:33.920 --> 15:38.520
Maybe their vital signs are slowing down
because they're hibernating.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.480
Maybe we'll wake up and find out
it's 400 years into the future,

15:41.560 --> 15:42.880
like in <i>Futurama.</i>

15:43.400 --> 15:47.040
I start slapping myself.
Stay awake, Calcare!

15:47.120 --> 15:50.560
I think of Luke Skywalker
who spent the night on the frozen planet,

15:50.640 --> 15:53.160
killed the pseudo-goat
with his lightsaber,

15:53.240 --> 15:55.880
and slipped inside its carcass to warm up.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.400
I look around to see
if there's a pseudo-goat nearby.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.720
The only creature big enough to host me

16:01.800 --> 16:03.640
is a nun that must weight a ton.

16:03.720 --> 16:06.040
I don't like my odds.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.960
She has such a fierce face.
I might not prevail.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.920
Luke Skywalker had his lightsaber,
but I have nothing.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.800
What if the nun kills me
and turns me into a scarf?

16:19.120 --> 16:20.360
So I go to the bathroom.

16:20.440 --> 16:23.920
A tight space full of piss
has to be warmer than this.

16:29.800 --> 16:33.760
Do you know why you keep going on
about how cold it is?

16:33.840 --> 16:35.960
I was sweaty and I catch colds easily.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.480
My throat is delicate--

16:37.560 --> 16:40.480
Calcare, my job is to be your conscience.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.800
I must verify whether you know
why you keep going on about the cold.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.120
Then we can pretend
nothing happened, if you like.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.760
What a drag!

16:47.840 --> 16:50.160
Yes, I know.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.680
You need to say it.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.640
Otherwise, I'd think
about where we're going.

16:54.720 --> 16:55.600
Okay, we're good.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.000
The subject is aware,

16:57.080 --> 16:59.960
and therefore can keep
performing his pantomime.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.720
And now what?
Should we light a fire to warm up?

17:06.760 --> 17:09.080
You should never say things out loud.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.920
It's a surefire way to break the spell.

17:30.760 --> 17:35.400
TRAIN FROM ROME
ARRIVAL 6:15 P.M. - 20 MINUTES LATE

20:00.680 --> 20:03.000
