WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:02.910
Do you know what's missing?

00:03.040 --> 00:04.460
Sketches for my new line.

00:04.650 --> 00:06.770
The attack -- it was my fault.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.230
Has sam been in here tonight?

00:08.360 --> 00:10.690
She left, and I let her go,
and I shouldn't have.

00:10.830 --> 00:12.460
Sam,this is my brother, "X."

00:14.440 --> 00:15.740
Have a nice night.

00:16.239 --> 00:17.860
It doesn't mean anything.

00:18.020 --> 00:19.310
It means everything.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.970
I haven't had a drink in over eight yearS.

00:21.160 --> 00:22.490
Tonight, that's gonna change.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.840
I haven't had sex in over 22 years.

00:25.060 --> 00:26.550
And tonight  that's gonna change.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.250
I'm trying out as a point guard.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.690
What's next is the phone's gonna ring,

00:30.940 --> 00:34.430
and the answer is either gonna be a yes or a no.

00:34.590 --> 00:36.820
It's going to be a yes.

00:36.980 --> 00:39.020
You need to convince lucas to do the movie.

00:39.150 --> 00:41.030
And you'll make it the movie he wants it to be.

00:41.170 --> 00:43.730
I'll stay on the movie,'cause it matters to me.

00:43.950 --> 00:46.210
Any history of diabetes in the family? Cancer?

00:46.330 --> 00:48.440
My birth mother died of cancer.
Why?

00:48.580 --> 00:50.260
I just want to run some tests.

00:53.310 --> 00:55.590
<font color=#38B0DE>One Tree Hill  Season 6 Episode 13

01:03.410 --> 01:07.160
Hi. I have to tell you something.

01:07.680 --> 01:10.050
Peyton, are you okay?

01:10.700 --> 01:12.030
I know it's late.

01:13.620 --> 01:15.460
It's okay if it's late. What's up?

01:16.400 --> 01:20.190
I'm not sure that I can call you my fiance anymore.

01:21.420 --> 01:25.290
'Cause I was thinking maybe
I'd start calling you my baby daddY.

01:27.030 --> 01:27.780
Are we --

01:27.910 --> 01:30.040
I'm having your baby, lucas scotT.

01:30.540 --> 01:31.990
Our baby.

01:32.650 --> 01:34.060
We're pregnant.

01:34.250 --> 01:36.920
And, oh, god, I know it's sudden.

01:37.480 --> 01:38.860
I just really want you to be okay with it,

01:38.980 --> 01:41.190
because I'm very, very okay with iT.

01:41.310 --> 01:44.220
And -- oh, and it's early.
I mean, it's too early.

01:44.340 --> 01:45.900
It's too early to even tell anybody.

01:45.990 --> 01:47.010
I love you.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.820
I love you, peyton.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.590
I love you, too.

01:56.480 --> 02:00.020
I hate it when deb calls to tell us
that she's sleeping over at skills'

02:00.130 --> 02:02.660
because her sleeping is not sleeping,

02:02.770 --> 02:05.410
and it's the last thing want to hear about
before I go to sleep.

02:07.090 --> 02:09.030
That was the charleston chiefs.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.200
You're looking at their newest point guard.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.860
Oh, my god!

02:16.950 --> 02:19.870
Oh, my god! And you say I'm badass.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.100
Millie left me because of gigi.

02:29.620 --> 02:31.070
I'm sorry, man.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.620
Just say you told me sO.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.560
You know you're my boy, right?

02:36.260 --> 02:38.960
But I told you gigi was trouble, man --

02:39.130 --> 02:40.920
always wanting you to work late.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.630
And what comes after working late?

02:43.020 --> 02:44.250
Freaky deaky.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.790
We didn't freaky or deaky,but she wanted to.

02:48.140 --> 02:50.720
And then millie found a picture of gigi on my cellphone.

02:51.210 --> 02:52.450
You didn't erase it?

02:52.740 --> 02:53.790
No.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.690
It's erased now.

02:58.510 --> 03:00.230
I don't know.Maybe millie was right.

03:00.350 --> 03:02.900
Maybe I enjoyed all the attention from gigi,

03:03.000 --> 03:06.180
so maybe I deserve to lose heR.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.290
She'll come back.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.830
You didn't see her.

03:11.770 --> 03:14.620
I'm not sure she can come back from a broken heart.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.074

03:23.470 --> 03:24.540
Excuse me.

03:25.110 --> 03:26.200
Excuse me.

03:26.980 --> 03:28.430
I need some help.My daughter --

03:28.550 --> 03:30.430
well, she's not my daughter.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.350
She's my foster daughter -- sort of.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.590
She's -- she's gone missing or run away or something.

03:34.700 --> 03:35.880
Okay, ma'am, slow down.

03:35.990 --> 03:38.820
Okay. Not a ma'am.And I'm -- I'm sorry.

03:38.940 --> 03:40.790
It's just I've been up all night looking for saM.

03:40.900 --> 03:43.210
Her name is sam,and she's usually back by now.

03:43.330 --> 03:46.290
Okay, so, sam, and she's done this before?

03:46.600 --> 03:48.590
Yes, but just to annoy me.It's --

03:48.700 --> 03:50.400
and she comes back?

03:50.750 --> 03:52.570
Yes, but this is different because --

03:52.670 --> 03:54.360
okay, ma'am, so far, all you have is a kid

03:54.460 --> 03:57.080
who's not really yours and who always comes bacK.

03:57.290 --> 03:59.240
There's nothing much we can do about that.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.460
- So, that's it?
- I'm sorrY.

04:01.850 --> 04:04.560
Look, come down to the station tomorrow
if she hasn't returned, okay?

04:06.050 --> 04:08.240
To protect and serve, my ass.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.140
Rise and shine,porcupine.

04:17.079 --> 04:19.430
Can a guy get five more minutes?

04:19.560 --> 04:22.340
Okay, but today's a big day at the scott house.

04:22.770 --> 04:24.620
How big are we talking?

04:24.750 --> 04:28.270
Bigger than if christmas,
your birthday, and pizza friday

04:28.390 --> 04:30.910
all happened on "bring chester to school" day.

04:31.460 --> 04:32.650
You made the b-league team?

04:32.780 --> 04:33.800
That's right, I made it.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.030
I'm a charleston chief.
I start practice today.

04:36.350 --> 04:37.590
You did it!

04:38.630 --> 04:39.810
We did it.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.700
Yay!

04:48.220 --> 04:49.630
Morning, sam.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.260
HeY.Um...

04:54.780 --> 04:56.460
thanks for letting me crash.

04:57.420 --> 04:59.280
Jack's friends are my friends.

05:00.110 --> 05:03.770
And friends...do things for friends.

05:04.580 --> 05:05.900
So, where's jack?

05:06.700 --> 05:07.920
Out.

05:15.860 --> 05:20.180
You know, sam,
I really wish you hadn't gone through my stufF.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.650
The sketches?

05:25.440 --> 05:26.950
I know you took them.

05:27.980 --> 05:31.220
And now you've really pissed me off.

05:45.850 --> 05:47.160
What now, julian?

05:47.310 --> 05:49.390
Well, the director's threatening to walk,

05:49.530 --> 05:51.530
and you've been summoned to oz.

05:51.710 --> 05:53.890
The head of the studio wants to talk with you in an houR.

05:54.170 --> 05:55.620
What the hell happened?

05:55.730 --> 05:56.680
***Screw you.

05:57.570 --> 05:59.980
I have a flight in two hours,
and I'm not gonna do your damned joB.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.890
You're the producer.
Why don't you meet with the studio?

06:02.070 --> 06:03.680
Well, he wants to meet with you.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.110
And because you wrote a script for his studio,
you're his bitch.

06:07.270 --> 06:09.340
And as always, you're a dick.

06:09.490 --> 06:12.740
Look, lucas,I worked really hard to get this movie green-lit,

06:12.880 --> 06:15.430
and you screwed it up.So, get over there,

06:15.560 --> 06:18.470
avoid the 405, and save this movie.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.320
So, tell me what you told brooke davis about those sketches.

06:26.490 --> 06:29.070
I didn't tell her anything,
'cause I don't know anything.

06:29.310 --> 06:31.890
Look, I gave brooke the sketches.That's all.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.690
I didn't rat you out.
I didn't even know you took them.

06:35.510 --> 06:38.580
It was all my fault anyway.
I was the one shooting off my mouth.

06:38.710 --> 06:40.950
Oh, so, you're feeling guilty now.

06:41.190 --> 06:42.760
Brooke was good to mE.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.520
RighT.

06:44.870 --> 06:46.060
Because she took you in?

06:46.330 --> 06:48.690
Put you up in that big house?

06:49.150 --> 06:50.600
Saved you from what?

06:50.740 --> 06:51.870
From being like us?

06:58.400 --> 07:00.450
I used to like you, saM.

07:00.690 --> 07:04.200
I thought jack had caught himself a nice piecE.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.610
But I don't like people who forget where they belong.

07:09.190 --> 07:11.220
Dude, lay ofF.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.860
Somebody grew a pair of balls last night.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.020
Brooke tried to run away, too.

07:26.330 --> 07:28.060
I think you two need to take some time

07:28.190 --> 07:30.640
to think about what a couple of idiots you are.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.930
I thought you were sober.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.010
Not anymorE.

08:01.490 --> 08:03.240
What are you doing here so early?

08:04.840 --> 08:06.870
Apologizing for yesterday.

08:07.760 --> 08:11.100
I was having a rage-against-the-man,

08:11.200 --> 08:12.910
tortured-artist moment.

08:13.130 --> 08:14.480
Oh, god.

08:14.770 --> 08:16.510
Kill me.I'm the man now?

08:16.880 --> 08:18.030
No.

08:18.530 --> 08:21.380
You're the one who took a chance on me
and guided my career,

08:21.500 --> 08:24.190
and if you think I should record
the songs from the label,I will.

08:24.370 --> 08:28.100
Mia, I never want you to think
I don't believe in your music.

08:28.220 --> 08:29.840
I mean,you're my first artist.

08:29.970 --> 08:32.890
It's like being my first kid.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.470
And so, no matter what,I love you.

08:36.590 --> 08:38.250
And I'm gonna support yoU.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.620
But you got to tell me what's really going on.

08:42.350 --> 08:44.560
It's not like I'm not writing.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.940
It's like I can'T.The first record --

08:48.070 --> 08:51.030
well, honey, your first record
--that was a lifetime of worK.

08:51.390 --> 08:52.660
But you can do this.

08:52.770 --> 08:55.870
You have so many songs in you.I could see that year ago.

08:56.260 --> 08:57.870
And I still see it now.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.860
So, here's the plan --

09:00.990 --> 09:03.680
I'm going to buy some time with our label partners,

09:03.910 --> 09:07.790
and you are going to go write some kick-ass songs, okay?

09:07.920 --> 09:11.060
That is, if you ever want to get on that ranky tour bus again.

09:11.870 --> 09:14.030
I will. I promisE.

09:18.900 --> 09:21.070
Your mama totally rocked that.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.550
Peyton.

09:22.740 --> 09:23.630
Hey, brooke, what are you --

09:23.770 --> 09:25.290
sam's gone.

09:59.550 --> 10:01.550
Save it for practice, scotT.

10:01.810 --> 10:02.940
Bobby.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.640
What are you doing here?I thought dave shea was the G.M.

10:05.880 --> 10:09.040
He is. I'm your new coach.

10:09.330 --> 10:10.380
What?

10:10.530 --> 10:13.660
Yeah, the truth is,
my heart was never really into being a G.M.

10:14.050 --> 10:17.670
I guess I just needed someone to remind me
never to give up on a dream, you know?

10:17.910 --> 10:20.870
Yeah, I had a friend who did the same for me.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.790
So, is this, uh --is this your comeback?

10:23.920 --> 10:25.040
Well, not yet.

10:25.210 --> 10:28.000
I don't even know that I'm a good enough
coach to turn you into a point guard.

10:28.390 --> 10:29.680
But we'll give it a shot.

10:30.610 --> 10:32.140
Welcome back.

10:32.740 --> 10:33.900
You, too.

10:36.020 --> 10:37.860
Oh, man, this is awesome.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.510
My dad's a charleston chief.

10:39.620 --> 10:41.920
He's at camp now, he's gonna play point guard.

10:44.220 --> 10:47.340
Sorry. I bet basketball makes you think about "q" huh?

10:48.030 --> 10:50.680
Yeah.I miss him.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.570
I wish I could go to his grave and talk to hiM.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.610
But mom won't go.

10:55.930 --> 10:57.790
It makes her too sad.

10:58.140 --> 11:00.170
Sometimes I go with my mama.

11:00.300 --> 11:01.990
Maybe you can go with us next time.

11:02.210 --> 11:04.240
I wish I could go today.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.650
Maybe I can show you the way.

11:07.090 --> 11:08.450
okay

11:18.410 --> 11:19.770
Millie, can we talk?

11:19.890 --> 11:22.180
Actually, I'm kind of busy right now pencil sharpening.

11:22.380 --> 11:25.140
Brooke's sort of a slave driver
when it comes to pencil points.

11:29.290 --> 11:30.850
Talk to mouth.

11:32.140 --> 11:34.550
Look, everything can be taken back.

11:35.170 --> 11:36.840
- can it? - Yes.

11:37.040 --> 11:40.400
And by the way you're both hurting,
it's obvious that you still love each otheR.

11:41.530 --> 11:46.560
Besides...it's not fair to take it out
on some poor,defenseless pencil.

11:49.130 --> 11:51.030
Just talk to mouth.

11:56.870 --> 11:58.130
Lucas scott.

11:58.810 --> 11:59.910
Paul norriS.

12:00.320 --> 12:00.940
Great script.

12:01.110 --> 12:01.870
Thank you.

12:01.980 --> 12:04.230
To make it to the screen,
we'll need the right team behind iT.

12:04.360 --> 12:05.340
That's why I asked you here.

12:05.460 --> 12:06.470
I know.And about the director --

12:06.590 --> 12:08.240
I want to talk about the producer.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.480
Julian?

12:09.650 --> 12:10.760
Julian.

12:10.910 --> 12:12.130
What do you think of him?

12:12.300 --> 12:13.790
Look, mr. Norris, I --

12:13.910 --> 12:15.050
paul.

12:15.180 --> 12:19.740
Paul, I'in tnew his business and can't really judge juliaN.

12:19.910 --> 12:23.580
From what I hear,
I think you're actually the best one to judge julian.

12:23.780 --> 12:25.800
Look, what happened yesterday makes me think

12:25.950 --> 12:27.740
that julian doesn't know what he's doinG.

12:27.860 --> 12:30.120
Now I got an a-list director
who's threatening to walK.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.180
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's not your faulT.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.340
Julian's the producer. He should have been therE.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.990
I'm a straight shooter.

12:37.160 --> 12:39.550
I know julian well.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.700
He's an unpredictable loose cannon

12:41.800 --> 12:44.890
whose arrogance gets in the way of doi his job.

12:45.970 --> 12:47.540
We're talking straight here,right?

12:48.400 --> 12:51.290
So, why do you keep working with him?

12:52.120 --> 12:54.070
'Cause he's my son.

13:23.780 --> 13:27.070
If you're looking for numb 23,it's already taken --

13:27.580 --> 13:28.880
by me...

13:29.970 --> 13:31.600
devon foX.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.780
- I'm nathan --
- I know. Scott.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.390
All-american at maryland.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.830
Got thrown through a window,

13:38.930 --> 13:41.920
cost you about $20 million guaranteed cash.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.380
Thew away your shot at the nba.

13:44.510 --> 13:45.990
Not very bright, are you?

13:47.990 --> 13:49.650
Thought you were a two guarD.

13:49.780 --> 13:52.280
I used to be. Switching to the point.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.860
Bad move.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.540
See, I'm the point guard,and this is my team.

13:56.740 --> 13:58.380
This is my shot at the nba,

13:58.510 --> 14:01.240
and I can guarantee I ain't throwing it away like you did.

14:05.090 --> 14:08.170
Sure hope your son grows up arter than you, 15.

14:12.300 --> 14:15.660
I take it my son didn't tell you about our connection.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.710
Well, uh...

14:17.930 --> 14:21.410
julian's not exactly up front when it comes to me.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.730
He decided to use his mother's last name a few years ago.

14:25.890 --> 14:29.040
Said he wanted to blaze his own trail,be his own man.

14:29.150 --> 14:32.990
So, he moved into a little studio apartmentin north hollywood,

14:33.130 --> 14:35.070
got a P.A. Job,fell in love.

14:36.370 --> 14:37.830
How is peyton?

14:39.240 --> 14:40.330
We're good.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.980
Good for you.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.390
Scotch?

14:43.540 --> 14:44.850
Ah, no, thanks.

14:44.990 --> 14:46.360
Peyton's a good girl.

14:46.830 --> 14:48.980
She got julian to focus on something long enough to

14:49.100 --> 14:51.220
get his film to sundance.

14:51.370 --> 14:55.880
Yeah, I-I heard it did well,had a lot of --had good buzz.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.050
Buzz fades.

14:58.650 --> 15:00.300
You're a tough audiencE.

15:00.430 --> 15:01.780
That's why I'm successful.

15:02.140 --> 15:04.980
And my son is a lot of talk.

15:05.320 --> 15:07.320
He says he wants to make it on his own,

15:07.440 --> 15:10.130
but he still came to me
when he needed money to make this movie.

15:10.250 --> 15:13.530
Well, I got to say I'm glad you gave it to hiM.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.470
Julian never had a problem  finding a good thing.

15:16.620 --> 15:18.580
It's his follow-through that's lacking.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.150
Besides,this movie's a good investment.

15:21.290 --> 15:24.050
It'll make money,especially in middle america.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.240
But I still keep asking myself the same question.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.560
What's that?

15:28.880 --> 15:30.850
Same one you should be asking.

15:31.410 --> 15:34.110
Is julian interested in making a good movie

15:34.610 --> 15:37.110
or finding a way to get peyton back?

15:54.020 --> 15:57.950
Ever see a '7dove shattered into like a gatrilceon pies?

15:58.060 --> 16:00.230
Wow, peyton said it wasn't pretty in here.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.210
Peyton's a big fan of the understatement.

16:02.320 --> 16:05.190
Peyton is also a big fan of yours, and so am I.

16:05.300 --> 16:07.590
So, I am here to help you.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.650
Blast from the past! Where did you find this?

16:12.890 --> 16:14.900
Clearly, not in your washing machine.

16:15.630 --> 16:19.000
I practically lived in this thing
when we recorded the first time.

16:19.140 --> 16:21.010
I know.And then the tour came around,

16:21.120 --> 16:23.740
and you left it behind,
so I thought I'd take care of it for you.

16:26.980 --> 16:28.200
Thanks.

16:29.260 --> 16:31.330
What do you say we try and find the girl

16:31.460 --> 16:33.320
who used to wear that hoodie?

16:43.500 --> 16:46.240
You're making quentin's favorite cookies again?

16:48.300 --> 16:50.730
Yeah, sweetie, I-I guess I am.

16:52.670 --> 16:56.990
Um, why don't you go on outside
and have fun with jamie, okay?

16:57.110 --> 16:59.320
And just make sure you stay in the yard, all right?

17:29.010 --> 17:29.930
What'd she say?

17:30.040 --> 17:31.070
She said we can go.

17:31.240 --> 17:32.730
And she even gave us cookies.

17:32.860 --> 17:34.040
Come on!

17:52.320 --> 17:53.720
Sam's still not answering.

17:53.860 --> 17:54.970
Will you try her again, please?

17:55.090 --> 17:56.760
Okay, sweetie, but your driving --

17:56.860 --> 17:58.250
can you just slow it down a little,

17:58.350 --> 18:01.140
'cause you're upset and I'm -- I'm carsick.

18:01.250 --> 18:03.580
I'm sorry. I just...

18:04.620 --> 18:07.350
I told sam that she could always talk to me about anything.

18:07.500 --> 18:11.680
And the first anything that
she talks to me about,and I just stood there.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.080
Well, you were in shocK.

18:13.260 --> 18:16.020
I mean, did she say anything about where she got the sketches?

18:16.240 --> 18:19.100
No.I didn't even ask.

18:19.630 --> 18:23.490
I'm supposed to be her foster-mother-guardian person,

18:23.600 --> 18:25.690
and I just -- I let her go.

18:25.820 --> 18:27.390
I didn't tell her it was gonna be okay.

18:27.530 --> 18:29.270
I didn't tell her that I love her no matter what.

18:29.410 --> 18:30.940
She knows.We're gonna find her

18:31.070 --> 18:32.860
so you can tell her a thousand times.

18:33.010 --> 18:34.210
I hope so.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.010
Why isn't she answering her cell?

18:43.750 --> 18:44.680
Damn it.

18:44.820 --> 18:46.450
Your freak of a brother took my phone.

18:46.630 --> 18:48.780
Okay, we got to get out of here
and call the police or something.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.710
We don't go to the police.

18:50.990 --> 18:51.850
He's my brother.

18:51.990 --> 18:53.250
Screw that, jack.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.100
Your brother is a sketchy, thieving perv,

18:55.210 --> 18:56.930
and you don't have to live like this.

18:57.210 --> 18:58.400
He doesn't have to beat you,

18:58.530 --> 19:01.930
and you don't have to be scared to come home
at night or piss him off.You don'T.

19:04.950 --> 19:07.440
It's open. Let's go.

19:17.330 --> 19:20.600
No!Get the hell off of me!Jack! Jack!

19:30.440 --> 19:32.560
Jack's not gonna get you help.

19:33.220 --> 19:34.600
Please.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.560
brooke, sweetie,you are gonna walk a hole in the floor.

19:42.670 --> 19:44.100
I don't care. We need new floors anywaY.

19:44.340 --> 19:45.450
Sam!

19:45.720 --> 19:48.520
Julian, right now is not the time for
whatever it is you're shoveling.

19:48.710 --> 19:50.820
Not fair. You know I like feisty.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.020
You want feisty?

19:52.130 --> 19:53.890
Peyton, it's okay.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.530
I know you were looking for sam last night.

19:58.020 --> 20:00.190
The waitress at the diner ratted you out.

20:01.020 --> 20:02.540
Sam's a good kid.

20:02.990 --> 20:05.710
She is.Thank yoU.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.570
So, how'd that all turn out?

20:08.800 --> 20:11.540
She's still gone, and I have no idea where to start

20:11.650 --> 20:13.120
because I know nothing about her real life.

20:13.310 --> 20:15.460
I was so busy laying down the law --

20:15.580 --> 20:16.660
no stealing from my wallet,

20:16.770 --> 20:17.550
no breaking into my store,

20:17.660 --> 20:18.550
no boys in your room.

20:18.660 --> 20:19.860
You're a good mom.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.590
No boys in her room except for the one in her beD.

20:22.770 --> 20:24.080
You're a cool mom.

20:24.210 --> 20:26.920
Oh, my god, I'm a stupid mom.
Jack daniels.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.660
Not the drink.The boy that was in sam's bed.

20:29.820 --> 20:31.690
I can't believe I didn't think about this earlier.

20:31.810 --> 20:32.950
I have --I have to find him.

20:33.070 --> 20:34.000
Okay, we'll just ask haley.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.710
Wait, sort of floppy hair?

20:35.870 --> 20:36.660
YeS.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.300
Yeah, she was with him at the diner.
I'll keep an eye out.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.600
Maybe he's not so baD.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.370
You know what?

20:46.750 --> 20:49.380
You just got a glimpse of the guy I used to know.

20:50.480 --> 20:54.560
The whole julian-peyton thing has got to be on your mind.

20:55.150 --> 20:56.800
No, I'm not worried about it.

20:57.070 --> 20:58.860
You should be.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.680
You don't like your son too much, do you?

21:07.220 --> 21:09.020
Sometimes...

21:09.790 --> 21:12.770
You have a vision of who you want your child to be,

21:12.900 --> 21:17.010
and no matter what you do,they fall shorT.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.790
So, about the director --

21:20.660 --> 21:23.380
I heard things went a bit off course.

21:23.590 --> 21:27.180
You should know,
julian has some very definite opinions about the director,

21:27.320 --> 21:29.330
and like everything else,

21:29.540 --> 21:31.350
he and I want different things.

21:31.550 --> 21:32.600
What do you want?

21:32.930 --> 21:35.590
I want a director that understands the characters,

21:35.810 --> 21:38.730
you know? I mean, someone who sees
and appreciates the small moments,

21:38.850 --> 21:40.710
because that's what this movie's really about.

21:40.860 --> 21:42.920
And this guy's not that director.

21:43.150 --> 21:46.150
No. I'm sorry, sir,

21:46.280 --> 21:48.170
but he's not that director.

21:49.390 --> 21:52.660
Funny. That's what my son said.

21:54.820 --> 21:58.530
That's what my mama said,
but I still believe in ghosts.

21:58.740 --> 22:01.360
Me, too.Especially at night.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.620
You scared of them?

22:02.870 --> 22:04.060
NaH.

22:04.350 --> 22:07.020
'Cause I think quentin is a good ghost.

22:07.310 --> 22:09.670
Betcha he plays ghost basketball.

22:09.830 --> 22:11.090
For sure.

22:11.380 --> 22:13.950
I think some ghosts are like angelS.

22:14.130 --> 22:14.940
Yeah.

22:15.070 --> 22:19.500
I wonder why ghosts don't need wings to fly and angels do.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.280
We should google that.

22:21.490 --> 22:22.360
Yeah.

22:22.490 --> 22:24.340
Are you sure we're going the right way?

22:24.460 --> 22:26.410
Yeah, 'cause we're following that ghost.

22:27.450 --> 22:29.130
Gotcha, scaredy.

22:32.270 --> 22:35.630
Hey, gentlemen, get set up!

22:36.160 --> 22:37.440
Come on, 15.

22:37.730 --> 22:38.990
What, you scared?

22:39.150 --> 22:40.990
Thinking about how you're not going to the nba?

22:41.240 --> 22:42.480
Again?

22:43.060 --> 22:44.620
Is that all you got?

22:49.680 --> 22:53.690
Let's go! Come on! Go,go,go.

22:56.540 --> 22:57.980
Come on, guys.Fight through.

22:58.170 --> 22:59.330
Fight through.

23:00.410 --> 23:01.670
Let's go!

23:03.430 --> 23:04.690
Back on "D."

23:07.450 --> 23:08.350
Ball! Ball! Ball!

23:08.820 --> 23:10.620
Come on!I got ball! I got ball!

23:13.100 --> 23:14.190
Yeah.

23:17.150 --> 23:18.510
Gotcha, babe!

23:19.410 --> 23:20.520
Oh, yes!

23:21.390 --> 23:24.540
Scott, take a seat.

23:25.150 --> 23:26.660
Shupert, you're in.

23:28.760 --> 23:30.290
Get comfortable, 15

23:30.410 --> 23:32.210
get real comfortable.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.480
Let's go! Come on!

23:47.820 --> 23:49.130
It sucks, right?

23:49.270 --> 23:51.410
No, it doesn't sucK.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.740
You might want to tell your face that.

23:54.270 --> 23:57.030
Okay, let's start from the beginning.
What's the song about?

23:57.550 --> 23:59.920
Well, it's about me...

24:00.100 --> 24:03.040
writing a song so I don't have to record the label's crap.

24:03.230 --> 24:06.180
Okay, so, how did you write your first album?

24:06.330 --> 24:08.550
Because I'm pretty sure it wasn't about you writing a hit.

24:08.670 --> 24:11.670
No. It was about making myself feel better

24:11.800 --> 24:14.240
and embarrassing my tool of a boyfriend.

24:15.060 --> 24:16.930
Okay, so, that's what you need.

24:17.060 --> 24:18.500
A horrible assface of a boyfriend?

24:18.630 --> 24:22.220
No, you need the inspiration and
the fight that you got from that --

24:22.430 --> 24:24.730
you know, the challenge from living your own life

24:24.860 --> 24:27.490
instead of sitting on a tour bus or in a music studio,

24:27.620 --> 24:29.540
willing yourself to write a hit song.

24:29.730 --> 24:31.850
You got to get up and get out there.

24:32.370 --> 24:33.540
What?

24:35.810 --> 24:38.400
Go outside.Go take a walk.Talk to a stranger.

24:38.540 --> 24:40.680
Find whatever it was that made you stop

24:40.800 --> 24:42.670
what you were doing and write a verse down on a napkin.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.890
And then come back here and see what happens.

24:45.020 --> 24:48.600
- Seriously? - Trust me, it works.Bye!

24:52.100 --> 24:53.250
Where are you going?

24:53.450 --> 24:55.200
I guess to get a life.

24:55.830 --> 25:00.830
Oh. What's wrong?

25:01.610 --> 25:02.990
It's sam.

25:09.210 --> 25:10.920
I am so sorry.

25:12.690 --> 25:13.870
Me too.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.260
You have nothing to feel sorry abouT.

25:16.820 --> 25:20.050
I should have been more considerate
about your feelings about gigi.

25:20.770 --> 25:23.160
And if you'll give me another chance,

25:23.350 --> 25:26.530
I'll do whatever it takes to have you back in my life,

25:26.950 --> 25:29.310
because you're the best part of me, millicent.

25:30.090 --> 25:31.840
You're the best part of us.

25:32.050 --> 25:34.300
I had sex last night.

25:39.390 --> 25:43.710
Say somethinG.Please.

25:47.230 --> 25:48.760
I'm sorry.

25:49.420 --> 25:52.870
I was drunk, and it was a mistake.

25:52.990 --> 25:55.490
And I wish I could take it back, because

25:56.400 --> 26:00.100
it was supposed to be you --us, but...

26:08.060 --> 26:10.630
This is the last address I have for jacK.

26:10.780 --> 26:13.740
Okay, thank you.Thank you.
Thank you.I hope she's there.

26:13.890 --> 26:15.960
She's a teenage girl.Trust me, she's there.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.920
Okay, brooke, we should get going.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.300
I think that I need to go by myself.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.130
I don't want to show up there like some parent patrol,

26:25.330 --> 26:28.050
and sam and i need to talk alone.

26:28.360 --> 26:29.010
Are you sure?

26:29.150 --> 26:31.540
Yeah, I'm sure. I-I'll call you, though.

26:31.650 --> 26:33.260
- I'll call both of you. Thank you.
- Okay.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.740
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.790
God, I hope she is there.

26:40.930 --> 26:41.940
Yeah, me, too.

26:42.060 --> 26:44.290
It was terrifying not knowing where jamie was.

26:44.500 --> 26:47.080
Sometimes, I just want to lock him up and homeschool him.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.670
That's my plan.

26:50.390 --> 26:53.360
I mean, in, like, the future when I need a plan.

26:56.270 --> 26:59.770
Oh, my god!You're pregnant!

27:00.530 --> 27:02.140
I don't what you're talking about!

27:02.260 --> 27:04.800
You are pregnant!I have dibs on godmother!

27:16.660 --> 27:21.810
Make one sound and you'll be an orphaN.Again.

27:26.450 --> 27:29.830
So, like I said, I'm looking for my foster daughter, sam,

27:30.020 --> 27:34.330
and I think that she's friends with your brother.

27:34.510 --> 27:37.120
Sorry i don't much pay attention to jack's friends.

27:37.330 --> 27:40.100
Well, is he here? Maybe I could talk to him.

27:40.270 --> 27:41.350
Nope.

27:41.750 --> 27:43.270
We're alone.

27:44.680 --> 27:48.890
Do you know where he is or where he hangs out?
Maybe they're together.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.530
Do you think they're having sex?

27:54.770 --> 27:56.300
Mmm, no.

27:56.710 --> 27:58.400
What's wrong with sex?

27:59.480 --> 28:03.910
Look, I don't know where the kid is.
He comes and goes, okay?

28:04.440 --> 28:06.620
I'm just trying to pay the bills around here.

28:06.930 --> 28:10.260
So, the truth is, it's better when he's gone.

28:10.510 --> 28:12.580
One less mouth eating up my fooD.

28:12.770 --> 28:16.690
Speaking of mouths, yours is nicE.

28:21.450 --> 28:22.980
That's good work on the court today.

28:23.170 --> 28:24.560
Not good enough.

28:25.220 --> 28:27.520
Well, hang in here.You're just coming back.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.550
The game's gonna have you on the ropes for a bit.

28:29.690 --> 28:31.310
Yeah,that and my teammates.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.170
Look, nate, you scare a lot of these guys.

28:36.970 --> 28:41.560
This league is their nba, and they know it's not yours.

28:48.230 --> 28:49.690
Oh, hey, coach,

28:52.340 --> 28:54.270
you mind if I wear the number 12?

28:54.530 --> 28:56.650
it*** someone special

29:36.140 --> 29:38.980
I'm taking your spot,because I'm better than yoU.

29:39.660 --> 29:41.280
But here's the good news --

29:41.480 --> 29:43.340
when I get called up to the nba,

29:43.510 --> 29:45.480
you can have your job back.

29:46.870 --> 29:48.520
I'll see you tomorrow.

29:53.610 --> 29:55.490
My mama cries a lot.

29:56.060 --> 29:58.170
She doesn't think I know,

29:58.320 --> 30:00.620
but I can hear her sometimes in her rooM.

30:00.810 --> 30:03.760
My dad used to cry, too,when he was hurt.

30:03.950 --> 30:04.970
What did you do?

30:05.120 --> 30:06.570
I tried to be his friend.

30:06.780 --> 30:09.530
My mama told me that sometimes

30:09.740 --> 30:13.880
people have to cry out all the tears
to make room for a heart full of smiles.

30:14.380 --> 30:17.690
Hope my mama is almost ready for a smile.

30:18.360 --> 30:21.250
Andre?Jamie?

30:22.850 --> 30:26.720
Boys?Honey?

30:57.870 --> 30:59.790
You're an idiot, you know that?

31:07.210 --> 31:09.200
I appreciate the time today,lucas.

31:09.340 --> 31:10.710
You're very impressive.

31:10.850 --> 31:11.690
Thank you.

31:11.810 --> 31:14.510
Which is why I think we need the right producer.

31:14.710 --> 31:16.100
I'll be in touch.

31:18.030 --> 31:19.400
You firing julian?

31:19.590 --> 31:21.590
You can't have a problem with that.

31:23.980 --> 31:26.380
Look, you like the script, right?

31:26.580 --> 31:29.210
'Cause julian was a big part of making it great.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.190
I doubt it.

31:31.380 --> 31:34.040
I know my son.I know what he can and can't do.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.100
With all due respect, sir,

31:36.390 --> 31:38.530
I just found out I'm gonna be a fatheR.

31:39.240 --> 31:42.040
And if one day my son comes to me
and asks me to believe in him

31:42.170 --> 31:45.180
or take a risk or bet on him,

31:46.250 --> 31:48.910
I can't believe that I wouldn't do thaT.

31:50.850 --> 31:54.170
So, you believe in julian?

31:54.470 --> 31:57.600
I believe he wants to make a great movie, yeah.

32:00.640 --> 32:03.210
Okay, he stays.

32:08.970 --> 32:10.220
What are you doing here, man?

32:10.400 --> 32:11.710
Peyton called me .

32:13.390 --> 32:15.090
What the hell happened?

32:16.860 --> 32:18.480
I got injured...

32:19.600 --> 32:21.640
During the slamball finals.

32:21.860 --> 32:24.250
They started me on this pain medication.

32:26.030 --> 32:28.570
I don't know. I thought I was doing okay at firsT.

32:29.330 --> 32:31.170
But I guess it's true --

32:31.670 --> 32:34.100
once an addict,always an addict.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.450
Things with brooke...

32:39.320 --> 32:41.460
you know,you need help with this.

32:42.240 --> 32:45.220
I mean, u're an alcoholic who's working at a bar.

32:45.360 --> 32:48.150
I know, but it's not like I can just walk ouT.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.260
Then I'll take over for yoU.

32:52.610 --> 32:55.210
I'm the worst carpet salesman out there anyways.

32:58.550 --> 33:00.420
You'd do that for me?

33:01.330 --> 33:02.550
No.

33:02.790 --> 33:04.850
I'd do that for the other version of you.

33:08.480 --> 33:09.960
Okay.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.560
Thanks.

33:16.980 --> 33:17.720
Hey.

33:17.830 --> 33:18.980
Hey, is sam with you?

33:19.610 --> 33:20.620
Kind of.

33:20.810 --> 33:22.430
I need your help.

33:25.720 --> 33:29.830
So, if you see sam, just please
tell her to call or come home.

33:30.840 --> 33:33.770
It probably makes you feel good,
taking in some poor kid, huh?

33:34.660 --> 33:36.890
Like you're doing something special,

33:37.600 --> 33:39.830
slumming with us poor folk.

33:40.030 --> 33:42.700
You don't know anything about me.

33:43.670 --> 33:45.180
Have a nice night.

33:57.530 --> 33:59.320
Have a nice nighT.

34:16.010 --> 34:17.350
Where is she?

34:17.600 --> 34:19.320
I know she's in here!

34:26.889 --> 34:28.050
Get off!

34:30.550 --> 34:31.639
Sam!

34:32.110 --> 34:33.210
Sam!

34:37.370 --> 34:38.870
Sam!

34:40.750 --> 34:41.830
Sam!

34:42.610 --> 34:43.790
Sam!

34:45.800 --> 34:47.030
Sam!

34:48.770 --> 34:50.080
Oh, my god!

34:50.210 --> 34:52.190
Okay, okay, okay.Okay, it's okay.

34:52.310 --> 34:54.080
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.It's okaY.

34:54.190 --> 34:56.400
He's the one who attacked you.
You have to get out.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.550
I know. I'm not leaving you here.

34:57.710 --> 34:58.860
You have to get out of here.

34:58.970 --> 35:00.870
I am not leaving you here!

35:03.230 --> 35:04.470
Brooke!No!

35:04.580 --> 35:05.160
sam.

35:05.250 --> 35:06.430
Leave her alone!

35:06.550 --> 35:08.600
You need to teach that little slut some manners!

35:08.700 --> 35:09.800
Get off of her!

35:09.930 --> 35:11.430
Get off of her!

35:11.660 --> 35:13.000
Stop it!

35:13.380 --> 35:14.890
Leavher alone!

35:15.040 --> 35:16.940
Should have finished the job when I had the chance!

35:17.100 --> 35:18.180
Brooke!

35:29.760 --> 35:32.630
I love watching you crawl, miss davis.

35:38.030 --> 35:40.850
Oh, what's wrong? Does the weak, little rich girl want to leave?

35:43.110 --> 35:45.710
The weak, little rich girl thinks she'll stay a while.

35:48.920 --> 35:53.380
You filthy, thieving, heartless piece of trash.

35:53.620 --> 35:54.940
You ain't gonna shoot me.

35:55.060 --> 35:56.990
Like I said, you don't know me.

35:57.670 --> 36:01.200
I'm not the same girl from the store that nighT.She's gone!

36:01.770 --> 36:06.180
You took my life, and you turned it into a nightmare.

36:06.850 --> 36:11.560
And all I have thought about is that I hate you.

36:16.560 --> 36:17.760
Brooke?

36:17.890 --> 36:20.020
I hate you.

36:23.590 --> 36:26.010
Brooke, please, don'T.

36:27.440 --> 36:28.850
Please.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.170
I need you, mom.

36:41.420 --> 36:43.520
I hate you so much.

36:45.230 --> 36:47.970
But you're not worth any more of my time.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.120
And you're not worth my life.

36:55.390 --> 36:57.450
You have a nice night.

37:02.330 --> 37:03.250
It's okay.

37:03.370 --> 37:05.260
I'm so sorry.

37:07.080 --> 37:10.190
It's okay.It's okay.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.870
You're safe.You're okay.

37:16.730 --> 37:18.000
It's okay.

37:30.700 --> 37:32.250
Hi, big brother.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.830
Brought you your favorite cookies.

37:45.900 --> 37:48.340
I was wondering if you could help me.

37:51.570 --> 37:54.580
Andre fields!Oh!

37:56.730 --> 37:59.760
I told you not to leave the yard!
Why did you leave the yard!

37:59.960 --> 38:02.130
Don't you know you are all I have left?

38:02.420 --> 38:03.900
Oh, god.

38:04.540 --> 38:07.340
Come here.Come here.Come here.

38:07.950 --> 38:09.020
Okay, come here.

38:09.150 --> 38:12.300
I'm sorry, mama.I just want to talk to quentin.

38:13.270 --> 38:14.580
What?

38:14.830 --> 38:16.970
I just want to ask him to let you know

38:17.120 --> 38:20.280
that he's all right so you're not sad anymorE.

38:24.500 --> 38:26.410
Oh, baby.

38:27.200 --> 38:30.020
Come here.Come herE.I'm sorrY.

Hey. Uh, is peyton around?

38:52.230 --> 38:54.710
No.SorrY.

38:54.860 --> 38:58.370
Hey, you wouldn't by chance know
how to make a long island iced tea, would you?

39:13.460 --> 39:15.290
I'm sorry.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.690
So am I.

39:30.860 --> 39:33.830
So, you're, like, way better at this than i am.

39:34.250 --> 39:35.740
Do you want a job tending bar?

39:36.120 --> 39:37.920
I can'T. I'm only 18.

39:38.600 --> 39:39.940
Have fun.

39:42.040 --> 39:45.590
If it helps, I have no idea
what I'm doing in there, either.

40:04.690 --> 40:06.490
Come on,  let me get you guys home.

40:09.560 --> 40:12.080
Hey, look what I found.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.500
Quentin fields' wallet.

40:16.360 --> 40:17.880
Oh, my god.

40:18.830 --> 40:20.700
He killed quentiN.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.430
Oh!

40:36.580 --> 40:37.550
Hey.

40:37.670 --> 40:39.880
Hey, daddy. How is it? What's it like?

40:40.020 --> 40:41.060
When can we see you play?

40:41.180 --> 40:42.550
Slow down, buddy.

40:42.750 --> 40:44.350
First, tell me how your day was.

40:44.460 --> 40:46.820
Yeah, jamie, how was your day?

40:48.180 --> 40:49.960
No, you first, daddy.

40:50.090 --> 40:51.300
Is it a dream come true?

40:52.540 --> 40:54.510
Yes, it is, son.

41:03.730 --> 41:06.910
Hi.You're home.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.370
How did it go?

41:09.500 --> 41:11.910
