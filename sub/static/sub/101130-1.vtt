00:00.220 --> 00:02.969
(dramatic music)

00:19.080 --> 00:21.830
(dramatic music)

00:31.720 --> 00:34.390
(intense music)

00:40.880 --> 00:43.710
(static rumbling)

01:17.660 --> 01:20.500
(static rumbling)

01:30.820 --> 01:33.520
-  AF825,
maintain flight level 3-0-0.

01:38.870 --> 01:40.400
AF825, Prague Tower,

01:40.400 --> 01:42.300
I'm picking a raw target
at your 11 o'clock,

01:42.300 --> 01:43.890
not painting a transponder.

01:43.890 --> 01:46.140
May be at a low altitude
sector, do you copy?

01:47.470 --> 01:50.220
(dramatic music)

01:52.920 --> 01:56.010
AF825, Prague Tower, I repeat,
I am picking up a raw target

01:56.010 --> 01:58.080
at your 11 o'clock not
painting a transponder.

01:58.080 --> 02:02.020
It may be at a low altitude
sector, do you copy?

02:21.480 --> 02:26.480
(thunder rumbling)
(honking)

02:27.030 --> 02:29.440
(baby cries)

02:35.310 --> 02:37.930
-  AF825, I'd like
to advise Prague Tower

02:37.930 --> 02:40.300
that target cannot be at a low altitude.

02:44.540 --> 02:48.830
Target is above me, descending
through my 3-5-0, tower.

02:48.830 --> 02:50.270
-  Say again, AF825.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.660
(static crackling)

02:51.660 --> 02:53.300
AF825, roger, you have traffic

02:53.300 --> 02:55.210
at 11 o'clock and descending.

02:55.210 --> 02:57.710
(baby crying)

03:15.850 --> 03:20.770
(heart beating)
(rumbling)

03:21.730 --> 03:22.560
(static crackling)
(beeping)

03:22.560 --> 03:25.920
- Observing a lighted
object moving to our--

03:25.920 --> 03:27.740
(static crackling)
(mutters)

03:27.740 --> 03:28.960
Approaching our nine o'clock position

03:28.960 --> 03:30.330
at a high rate of speed.

03:31.730 --> 03:33.440
-  AF825, copy that.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.110
We're checking to see if
anyone knows who this is.

03:35.110 --> 03:35.690
Stand by.

03:35.970 --> 03:37.750
(static crackling)
AF825,

03:37.750 --> 03:39.750
can you see the aircraft type?

03:39.750 --> 03:40.840
- It's heading right for us.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.800
Course one three seven.
(beeping)

03:42.820 --> 03:44.960
This thing is moving like
a ballistic missile Prague Tower.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.390
(beeping drowns out pilot)

03:46.390 --> 03:48.360
Targeting the river.
- Pull up!

03:48.360 --> 03:51.000
- Bright lights, altering white to red--
(men screaming)

03:53.570 --> 03:56.320
(dramatic music)

03:59.810 --> 04:02.740
(baby crying)

04:02.740 --> 04:04.910
(booming)

04:14.730 --> 04:18.529
- Get her from the water!
(splashing)

04:18.529 --> 04:23.530
(thunder rumbling)
(static crackling)

04:27.390 --> 04:30.130
-  AF825,
repeat, we have lost target.

04:30.130 --> 04:32.660
Do you still have visual?

04:32.660 --> 04:33.910
- Negative, Prague Tower.

04:35.060 --> 04:36.380
-  AF825, I was painting

04:36.380 --> 04:38.690
an unidentified target coming
at you from eight miles,

04:38.690 --> 04:40.640
11 o'clock position and
now you're telling me

04:40.640 --> 04:40.660
11 o'clock position and
now you're telling me
that it's just gone?

04:40.660 --> 04:41.820
that it's just gone?

04:47.010 --> 04:48.410
- Affirmative, Prague Tower.

04:49.290 --> 04:53.660
It was there and then it wasn't.

04:54.650 --> 04:57.400
(dramatic music)

05:06.880 --> 05:08.720
-  Do you remember
that time we were running

05:08.720 --> 05:10.650
through the forest?
- Yes.

05:10.650 --> 05:12.730
-  And we had that
little dog, what was his name?

05:12.730 --> 05:13.560
Maxie?

05:13.560 --> 05:14.390
We named him--
- Maxie?

05:14.390 --> 05:15.340
-  Yeah, Maxie.

05:15.340 --> 05:17.720
And he latched onto the back of your pants

05:18.560 --> 05:19.560
and you kept running?
- No, no.

05:19.560 --> 05:20.890
- And he was pulling them down.

05:20.890 --> 05:22.820
And we could see your little bottom.

05:22.820 --> 05:23.680
- It's not true.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.530
- It was true, come on,

05:24.530 --> 05:26.560
you remember Maxie.
- No, no.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.150
Yeah, I remember!
- You remember Maxie.

05:35.510 --> 05:38.270
-  I don't remember
the drive being so beautiful.

05:40.310 --> 05:42.180
- Yeah, you always loved this drive.

05:43.130 --> 05:44.980
- How much longer until we get there?

05:48.310 --> 05:50.010
- You sound just like your mother.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.870
- That's the first time
you've said it to me since--

05:54.870 --> 05:56.820
- I'm glad you changed your mind, Teri.

05:58.850 --> 06:00.370
It's been way too long.

06:04.570 --> 06:05.640
- I love you, Daddy.

06:09.010 --> 06:10.900
Can't wait to see the cottage.

06:12.150 --> 06:14.230
(laughs)

06:20.610 --> 06:23.360
(engine revving)

06:37.920 --> 06:39.960
- Almost there.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.870
It's been a while, huh?

06:52.240 --> 06:53.070
Okay.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.450
It's a new day.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.650
Come on, your holiday begins now.

07:11.460 --> 07:12.290
All right.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.250
Come on, what are you waiting for, monkey?

07:17.250 --> 07:18.080
An invitation?

07:33.440 --> 07:36.020
(Martin sighs)

07:37.180 --> 07:40.030
Oh, sweetness, hey, hey, hey.

07:40.030 --> 07:43.260
I miss her too, Teri.

07:43.260 --> 07:46.670
I miss Mom more than you know.

07:46.670 --> 07:49.380
Hey, hey, no, no, that's not true.

07:49.380 --> 07:51.410
I speak three languages, okay?

07:51.410 --> 07:56.240
I speak, uh, English,
Australian, and American.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.670
All the places I've lived.

07:57.670 --> 08:00.350
- You've lived here for twenty years
and you still don't speak Czech.

08:00.350 --> 08:01.810
- Yeah, but I understand
every single world.

08:01.810 --> 08:05.480
- That doesn't pardon you.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.580
- You know, maybe it's the place,

08:08.580 --> 08:10.980
but I think so much clearer
when we're together.

08:11.890 --> 08:13.340
Hey, I did notice, it's pretty.

08:13.340 --> 08:14.910
- Thank you.

08:14.910 --> 08:15.790
It was a gift.

08:15.790 --> 08:16.620
- And I think it's great

08:16.620 --> 08:18.300
you're going back to
school here in Europe.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.300
Maybe eventually working at the company.

08:21.530 --> 08:22.830
So what changed your mind?

08:25.520 --> 08:26.470
- I met a guy.

08:28.600 --> 08:29.440
- What?

08:29.440 --> 08:30.700
- What?

08:30.700 --> 08:32.610
- I mean, that's, that's great.

08:32.610 --> 08:33.440
Really.

08:35.110 --> 08:36.690
So that's what changed your mind

08:36.690 --> 08:38.730
about coming up to the cottage.

08:38.730 --> 08:39.559
- Dad.

08:40.590 --> 08:41.630
It was hard.

08:42.580 --> 08:45.180
For both of us, when Mom disappeared.

08:45.180 --> 08:48.680
And I'm just really happy now.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.690
And I was hoping that you
would be happy for me.

09:01.260 --> 09:02.160
- What's his name?

09:04.850 --> 09:06.090
- Robert.

09:06.090 --> 09:08.680
(gentle music)

09:11.890 --> 09:13.170
- Can't wait to meet Robert.

09:13.170 --> 09:14.270
He's a very lucky man.

09:15.780 --> 09:17.330
But you'll always be my monkey.

09:20.930 --> 09:22.860
- Love you, Dad.
- Love you.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.860
Good night.
- Good night.

09:26.930 --> 09:28.930
(sighs)

09:37.860 --> 09:39.860
(sighs)

09:45.600 --> 09:48.870
(electricity crackling)

09:48.870 --> 09:50.130
Dad!

09:50.130 --> 09:52.490
What's wrong with the lights?

09:52.490 --> 09:54.990
(tense music)

10:16.680 --> 10:18.680
Dad, power's surging again.

10:19.730 --> 10:21.180
- Must be that old generator.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.870
Thought I had that fixed.

10:24.870 --> 10:26.630
- I thought you had that fixed.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.300
I'm tired, Dad, I'm going to bed.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.130
Good night.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.880
- Okay, I'll take it apart tomorrow.

10:33.740 --> 10:34.570
Good night.

10:36.590 --> 10:37.940
Or maybe Robert can fix it.

11:07.560 --> 11:11.630
- We choose to forget.
(static crackling)

11:21.550 --> 11:23.020
(static crackling)
(gasping)

11:23.020 --> 11:26.020
(car alarm beeping)

11:34.580 --> 11:37.670
(electronic humming)

12:02.290 --> 12:03.990
(glass shattering)

12:03.990 --> 12:04.830
- Teri?

12:05.880 --> 12:08.630
(dramatic music)

12:13.670 --> 12:15.330
Teri.

12:15.330 --> 12:17.580
(rumbling)

12:28.210 --> 12:29.050
Teri!

12:31.100 --> 12:36.010
(gasps)
(glass shattering)

12:38.290 --> 12:39.130
Teri!

12:47.760 --> 12:48.600
Teri?

12:50.430 --> 12:54.940
(fizzing)
(Martin groans)

12:54.940 --> 12:57.610
(door slamming)

13:14.240 --> 13:15.070
Teri!

13:16.660 --> 13:17.490
Oh, no.

13:27.430 --> 13:30.350
(glass clattering)

13:32.810 --> 13:36.630
(car alarm beeping)

13:36.630 --> 13:38.600
Teri!

13:38.600 --> 13:41.450
(static rumbling)

13:41.450 --> 13:43.870
(gun firing)

13:49.120 --> 13:50.030
Stop, Teri!

13:51.140 --> 13:52.060
Teri, wait!

13:58.740 --> 13:59.580
Teri!

14:02.480 --> 14:03.310
Hey, wait!

14:09.800 --> 14:10.630
Teri!

14:27.220 --> 14:28.050
Teri!

14:34.520 --> 14:37.600
(electronic humming)

14:46.340 --> 14:47.170
Teri!

14:48.500 --> 14:50.890
(dramatic music)
Teri!

14:50.890 --> 14:53.280
(booming)
(screaming)

14:53.280 --> 14:54.110
Teri!

14:55.640 --> 14:56.560
Teri, Teri!

14:59.010 --> 15:01.340
(splashing)

15:04.140 --> 15:05.550
(Martin screams)

15:05.550 --> 15:07.800
(thudding)

15:13.560 --> 15:16.890
(heart monitor beeping)

15:25.320 --> 15:27.400
(grunts)

15:52.910 --> 15:55.740
(machine beeping)

16:04.170 --> 16:05.140
- Mr. Fell?

16:06.120 --> 16:07.220
You're awake.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.120
- Hey.

16:15.910 --> 16:17.160
Teri?

16:17.160 --> 16:17.990
Where's?

16:20.920 --> 16:21.750
Where's Teri?

16:22.980 --> 16:23.810
Where is she?

16:26.570 --> 16:29.940
No, no, where is she--
- Shh, shh, shh.

16:29.940 --> 16:31.190
- Where's Teri?
- Shh.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.880
(people chattering)

16:43.680 --> 16:46.230
-  You sustained
a severe concussion.

16:46.230 --> 16:50.210
Expect headaches and some
severely bruised ribs.

16:50.210 --> 16:54.040
Also, mild hypothermia from exposure.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.040
If the police hadn't
found you when they did,

16:56.040 --> 16:58.200
it could have been much, much worse.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.050
-  She was a gift from above.

17:00.940 --> 17:01.770
Where is she?

17:01.770 --> 17:05.630
Uh, doc, why won't you
tell me where she is?

17:07.540 --> 17:08.890
-  I'm sorry.

17:08.890 --> 17:10.069
I'm not allowed to say.

17:10.069 --> 17:11.690
(Martin laughs)

17:11.690 --> 17:13.619
- You see, you see this?

17:13.619 --> 17:17.030
This is, this is, I'm okay.

17:17.030 --> 17:17.859
All right?

17:17.859 --> 17:19.260
There's nothing wrong with me.

17:20.710 --> 17:21.540
Please.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.250
Where's my daughter?

17:26.119 --> 17:26.950
- I can't.

17:35.860 --> 17:36.930
- Sorry, um.

17:41.690 --> 17:42.660
Excuse me, sir?

17:46.390 --> 17:49.360
Are you able to tell me what
happened to my daughter?

17:49.360 --> 17:51.860
(tense music)

17:53.600 --> 17:54.860
- Agent Ray Bowie.

18:09.510 --> 18:12.090
(door closing)

18:13.790 --> 18:15.710
- You a cop, Ray Bowie?

18:17.980 --> 18:18.910
Because if you're not a cop,

18:18.910 --> 18:22.910
I'd like to finish up
with the medical stuff.

18:22.910 --> 18:24.490
- Fine by me.

18:24.490 --> 18:26.920
But he's not gonna tell
you what you want to know.

18:28.070 --> 18:31.020
There's been a terrible
accident, as you know.

18:31.020 --> 18:33.080
An earthquake, big one.

18:33.080 --> 18:34.860
6.8, so I heard.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.320
Unusual for these parts, for sure.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.320
- No, I didn't know.

18:40.350 --> 18:42.060
- Your cottage is gone, Mr. Fell.

18:43.270 --> 18:45.540
Came down when the fault slipped.

18:46.950 --> 18:49.990
A fire, too, something
about a faulty generator.

18:49.990 --> 18:52.770
- Yeah, I, I remember, we were
having generator problems.

18:52.770 --> 18:55.080
- Must be why you and your
daughter ran into the woods,

18:55.080 --> 18:55.910
a fire?

18:57.110 --> 18:59.660
- No, I, I don't remember any fire.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.620
-  At least that's where
we found you, the swamps.

19:02.620 --> 19:04.400
Half a click from your cottage.

19:09.660 --> 19:10.490
- Where's Teri?

19:11.640 --> 19:15.100
- I hate to be the one to
break this to you, Mr. Fell,

19:15.100 --> 19:17.420
but we haven't been
able to locate her body.

19:17.420 --> 19:20.460
We're dredging the swamps now as we speak,

19:20.460 --> 19:21.710
so unless you can give me

19:21.710 --> 19:24.330
some place more productive to look.

19:30.110 --> 19:32.120
(machine beeping)
- She's all I...

19:45.930 --> 19:47.240
-  I'll give him a sedative.

19:47.240 --> 19:48.920
He needs to calm down and get some rest.

19:48.920 --> 19:52.050
- When Mr. Fell is sorted,
please let me know.

19:53.690 --> 19:55.680
We were just starting to get acquainted.

19:56.860 --> 19:58.020
I'll wait outside.

20:05.870 --> 20:07.450
-  Just relax, Mr. Fell.

20:07.450 --> 20:09.220
This will put you to sleep.

20:17.410 --> 20:18.960
I'll be outside if you need me.

20:35.340 --> 20:38.090
(dramatic music)

20:39.890 --> 20:42.560
(Martin groans)

20:55.180 --> 20:56.480
-  Show me the scene.

21:17.990 --> 21:19.550
Get me a five mile perimeter

21:19.550 --> 21:22.100
and let me know when the
crime scene photos are up.

21:24.270 --> 21:25.110
- Sir?

21:25.110 --> 21:26.760
Did you get anything?
- Not yet.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.090
Take care of that, Robert.

21:32.090 --> 21:35.920
-  Hey, hey, hey, you
can't go in there right now.

21:35.920 --> 21:36.750
Hey.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.500
(tense music)

21:42.030 --> 21:43.440
- He's running, let's go.

21:58.110 --> 22:01.550
-  All right, let's go that way.

22:01.550 --> 22:03.710
All right, let's go, let's go around.

22:03.710 --> 22:05.050
Back of the car.

22:31.180 --> 22:33.930
(dramatic music)

22:45.650 --> 22:48.490
-  Hey, Martin, are you okay?

22:53.920 --> 22:56.590
(phone ringing)

23:13.570 --> 23:16.640
(machine whirring)

23:16.640 --> 23:18.300
-  What the?

23:47.540 --> 23:50.290
(engine revving)

24:01.220 --> 24:03.970
(radio rumbling)

24:35.800 --> 24:38.970
(helicopter whirring)

24:41.850 --> 24:44.010
(groans)

24:44.010 --> 24:46.270
-  You are
in a restricted area.

24:46.270 --> 24:49.560
Turn your car around immediately.

24:49.560 --> 24:51.770
You are in a restricted area.

24:51.770 --> 24:54.450
Turn your car around immediately.

24:54.450 --> 24:57.730
I repeat: you are in a restricted area.

24:57.730 --> 25:00.480
Turn your car around immediately.

25:10.660 --> 25:13.660
(machinery beeping)

25:20.130 --> 25:23.300
(helicopter whirring)

25:26.090 --> 25:27.810
(groans)

25:27.810 --> 25:30.560
(dramatic music)

25:35.870 --> 25:37.030
No, not again.

25:40.020 --> 25:43.020
(machinery beeping)

25:53.270 --> 25:54.730
- Now, who would you be shooting at

25:54.730 --> 25:57.680
behind the wheel of
your expensive car here?

25:57.680 --> 25:58.510
- I remember.

25:59.770 --> 26:01.020
I remember what happened.

26:02.280 --> 26:05.200
Teri, wait!
(emotional music)

26:09.460 --> 26:12.130
There were about, about 20 of them.

26:12.130 --> 26:13.620
They were taking her there,

26:13.620 --> 26:15.580
over there, towards that harvester.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.530
-  You sure she wasn't
trying to take your car?

26:24.530 --> 26:25.360
- Excuse me?

26:27.190 --> 26:31.170
- You sure Teri, your daughter,
wasn't, say, mad at you?

26:31.170 --> 26:33.140
-  Why would she be mad at me?

26:33.140 --> 26:35.520
- Maybe because you two had
a fight about your wife,

26:35.520 --> 26:38.060
her mother, she disappeared
at this very cottage,

26:38.060 --> 26:39.970
what, almost two years ago?

26:41.670 --> 26:43.560
- You know nothing about my wife.

26:44.440 --> 26:47.340
- Looks like you were
chasing after someone.

26:47.340 --> 26:48.510
Took a shot with that.

26:56.190 --> 26:59.140
Luckily, she managed to get
behind the door before you did.

27:02.550 --> 27:03.380
Bang!

27:08.010 --> 27:08.840
We checked.

27:10.250 --> 27:11.480
Gunshot residue.

27:12.510 --> 27:14.020
-  What is, what is that?

27:14.020 --> 27:16.290
(tense music)

27:16.290 --> 27:17.390
What the, what the hell is that?

27:17.390 --> 27:18.220
Show me!

27:18.220 --> 27:19.050
No, that's Teri's!

27:19.050 --> 27:20.490
That's Teri's, show me that!

27:21.720 --> 27:22.550
What did?

27:23.650 --> 27:25.380
Yeah, I fired the gun.

27:25.380 --> 27:27.560
But that's not what happened.

27:27.560 --> 27:28.770
That is not what happened!

27:28.770 --> 27:31.670
- I thought you couldn't
remember what happened, Mr. Fell.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.590
(electricity fizzes)

27:34.590 --> 27:36.110
(grunting)

27:36.110 --> 27:37.540
(dramatic music)

27:37.540 --> 27:41.040
(speaking foreign language)
(guns firing)

27:41.110 --> 27:42.770
-  Stop. Hold fire, hold fire.

27:44.240 --> 27:47.410
(helicopter whirring)

27:55.240 --> 27:57.740
(guns firing)

27:59.090 --> 28:03.340
(man speaking in foreign language)

28:18.960 --> 28:19.660
- Mr. Fell!

28:19.660 --> 28:21.460
I need to talk to you about your daughter!

28:21.460 --> 28:23.710
(grunting)

28:26.850 --> 28:29.100
(shouting)

28:34.800 --> 28:35.670
-  Leave him here.

28:35.670 --> 28:37.490
Get it cleaned up.

28:37.490 --> 28:40.240
(dramatic music)

28:43.810 --> 28:48.810
(electricity crackling)
(pilot shouting)

28:48.880 --> 28:51.880
(footsteps falling)

29:03.210 --> 29:06.050
(heavy breathing)

30:16.690 --> 30:19.270
(somber music)

31:41.230 --> 31:43.980
(dramatic music)

32:02.680 --> 32:07.680
(engine rumbling)
(phone dialing)

32:07.950 --> 32:09.920
-  David, it's Martin.

32:09.920 --> 32:10.750
- Martin?

32:10.750 --> 32:11.640
Where the hell are you?

32:11.640 --> 32:12.760
What's going on?

32:12.760 --> 32:13.910
The cops have been calling.

32:13.910 --> 32:15.580
-  I don't know what
they are, but they're not cops.

32:15.580 --> 32:17.410
- Of course they're cops,
what else would they be?

32:17.410 --> 32:18.970
-  She's not dead, David.

32:18.970 --> 32:20.220
- What?
- Teri.

32:20.220 --> 32:21.680
She's not dead, David.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.150
I can't lose 'em both, David.

32:23.150 --> 32:24.400
Do you hear me?

32:24.400 --> 32:26.620
Not like this.
(birds cawing)

32:26.620 --> 32:28.380
I need a few days to figure this all out.

32:28.380 --> 32:31.130
(dramatic music)

33:18.350 --> 33:20.940
(horn honking)

33:24.920 --> 33:27.840
(static crackling)

33:30.900 --> 33:33.400
(tense music)

33:38.790 --> 33:41.540
(woman shouting)

33:42.930 --> 33:45.260
- She went in with the baby.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.950
(birds chirping)

33:58.850 --> 34:01.600
(dramatic music)

34:31.480 --> 34:34.230
(birds chirping)

34:49.030 --> 34:51.190
(booming)

34:52.409 --> 34:56.159
(static crackling)
(dramatic music)

34:56.159 --> 34:58.410
(groaning)

35:05.800 --> 35:08.550
(dramatic music)

35:24.630 --> 35:27.410
(phone dialing)

35:27.410 --> 35:28.740
-  Hello?

35:30.630 --> 35:31.550
- JoannaCZ?

35:33.200 --> 35:35.360
-  Who is this?

35:35.360 --> 35:36.710
- My name is Martin Fell.

35:37.640 --> 35:39.500
I got your number from the internet.

35:39.500 --> 35:43.160
No, wait, from the chat between you and--

35:43.160 --> 35:44.550
- The pilot.

35:44.550 --> 35:46.530
The AF825 is a pilot.

35:47.750 --> 35:50.290
He saw the symbol and the UFO.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.540
- Excuse me, hey, excuse me.

36:06.540 --> 36:08.120
Who are you?

36:08.120 --> 36:10.120
You can't get in here, please turn around.

36:10.120 --> 36:10.950
Turn around now.

36:10.950 --> 36:12.710
You, hey, do you hear me?

36:12.710 --> 36:13.810
You gotta back up now.

36:15.460 --> 36:16.770
-  You saw the symbol, didn't you?

36:16.770 --> 36:17.600
- What symbol?

36:17.600 --> 36:19.970
- A clockwise spiral with a center mark.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.700
You obviously know what I mean.

36:23.700 --> 36:27.050
Let me guess, you're seeing
it everywhere you look.

36:27.890 --> 36:28.720
- Yeah.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.290
- Ever since--
- The abduction.

36:31.670 --> 36:33.170
-  We choose to forget.

36:36.240 --> 36:38.460
Are you a believer, Martin Fell?

36:38.460 --> 36:39.290
- I don't know what to believe.

36:39.290 --> 36:41.670
I just, I just can't
quite remember everything.

36:41.670 --> 36:43.920
- Memory's a strange thing.

36:43.920 --> 36:46.000
We think it's set in
stone, but in reality,

36:46.000 --> 36:47.470
it's more like water.

36:48.650 --> 36:51.190
Anyone who's lost someone
knows the feeling.

36:51.190 --> 36:52.080
It's fluid.

36:53.000 --> 36:53.830
Water.

36:53.830 --> 36:54.660
- And I'm drowning.

36:55.720 --> 36:57.220
-  So am I.

36:59.950 --> 37:02.600
- They took my daughter, Teri.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.170
- Wait?

37:04.170 --> 37:05.000
Where are you?

37:05.000 --> 37:05.910
- I don't know.

37:05.910 --> 37:07.360
An internet cafe.

37:11.150 --> 37:12.210
Why?

37:12.210 --> 37:13.040
- Run.

37:14.010 --> 37:14.840
- Shit.

37:23.170 --> 37:24.000
(phone ringing)

37:24.000 --> 37:25.720
- Come on, Martin, come.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.580
-  Hi, you've reached Martin Fell.

37:27.580 --> 37:28.410
Please leave a message.

37:28.410 --> 37:29.440
-  Martin, call me back please.

37:29.440 --> 37:32.470
Tell me where you are
and I'll come meet you.

37:32.470 --> 37:33.520
- Give me your phone.

37:35.090 --> 37:36.580
(phone ringing)

37:36.580 --> 37:39.330
(dramatic music)

37:49.920 --> 37:52.170
(shouting)

37:54.030 --> 37:58.530
(thudding)
(grunting)

38:08.410 --> 38:09.760
- You lying son of a bitch.

38:11.350 --> 38:12.350
There wasn't a fire.

38:13.350 --> 38:14.320
No earthquake.

38:15.950 --> 38:16.890
Where is she?

38:18.900 --> 38:21.990
Where is she?!

38:21.990 --> 38:24.440
- Maybe you should answer
yourself that question.

38:26.380 --> 38:27.210
- Yeah?

38:31.500 --> 38:33.150
Maybe this has some answers, huh?

38:37.980 --> 38:39.490
You lying bastard!

38:46.710 --> 38:47.540
Back off.

38:48.950 --> 38:49.900
-  Let him go.

39:21.470 --> 39:24.130
(phone dialing)

39:28.090 --> 39:28.940
-  Hello?

39:29.950 --> 39:31.650
-  How did you
know they were coming?

39:31.650 --> 39:34.150
-  I didn't think
I'd hear from you again.

39:35.290 --> 39:37.090
- Agent Bowie was there.

39:37.090 --> 39:38.020
I took his tablet.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.520
There's so much information on here.

39:41.520 --> 39:42.760
I found a file.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.680
More like a collection
of case files on it.

39:46.980 --> 39:48.400
-  Go on.

39:50.550 --> 39:52.400
- Bowie knows everything
about Anna's disappearance

39:52.400 --> 39:54.410
two years ago from the cottage.

39:54.410 --> 39:55.240
Everything.

39:56.190 --> 39:59.140
(slamming)

39:59.140 --> 40:01.710
He's been tracking Teri and I ever since.

40:02.740 --> 40:04.240
-  Who's Anna?

40:04.240 --> 40:05.070
- My wife.

40:06.290 --> 40:08.250
There's hundreds of cases on here.

40:08.250 --> 40:10.560
All investigated by Agent
Bowie, all the same.

40:11.760 --> 40:14.240
Red, white, flashing, unknown object.

40:14.240 --> 40:17.160
Someone abducted or
missing after the event.

40:23.540 --> 40:26.040
A symbol, the symbol.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.540
Left all over the crime scene.

40:30.810 --> 40:32.310
-  You still there?

40:32.310 --> 40:33.140
- I got a ping.

40:33.140 --> 40:34.760
Confirming that it's his IMSI.

40:35.690 --> 40:37.450
- Yeah, I'm still here.

40:37.450 --> 40:38.760
He's got notes on these cases

40:38.760 --> 40:41.950
and he's stamped the
same thing on each one.

40:41.950 --> 40:42.780
Unchosen.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.750
What's Bowie covering up?

40:46.750 --> 40:47.900
- Confirmed.

40:47.900 --> 40:49.000
Placing the trace now.

40:50.160 --> 40:50.990
- Where?

40:52.750 --> 40:53.880
- Parizska Street.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.800
- His apartment, let's go.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.370
-  They're tracing your phone.

40:58.380 --> 40:59.210
We need to meet.

41:00.350 --> 41:02.330
Hang up, get on the bus,

41:02.330 --> 41:04.990
get off at the river, the stop at Brehova.

41:04.990 --> 41:07.110
Call me when you reach the water.

41:10.020 --> 41:11.420
- He's on a bus.

41:16.450 --> 41:19.110
And it stops K listopadu and Brehova.

41:20.250 --> 41:22.940
Which means he's going to the river.

41:22.940 --> 41:24.140
-  Where are you?

41:24.140 --> 41:25.610
-  I'm almost there.

41:25.610 --> 41:26.780
Where to next?

41:30.950 --> 41:32.120
-  There!

41:36.250 --> 41:38.500
(shouting)

41:41.850 --> 41:43.750
- Bowie, it's not him!

41:43.750 --> 41:44.600
What's wrong with you?

41:44.600 --> 41:47.380
- What's your problem, man?
- Shit!

41:47.380 --> 41:48.990
- Hey.

41:48.990 --> 41:51.490
(tense music)

41:53.850 --> 41:55.180
-  Yeah.

41:56.990 --> 41:58.310
Okay, where am I going?

41:58.310 --> 41:59.140
- With me.

42:05.560 --> 42:06.840
I know you.

42:06.840 --> 42:10.970
- Yeah, I, uh, I get
that a lot these days.

42:13.700 --> 42:14.530
Martin Fell.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.080
- Good to see you.

42:19.080 --> 42:20.500
- Yeah.

42:20.500 --> 42:21.330
- Come on.

42:27.260 --> 42:30.430
That's Jacek, I'm Jo,
short for Joanna, get in.

42:30.430 --> 42:32.080
And dump your phone in the river.

42:36.890 --> 42:39.640
(dramatic music)

43:15.470 --> 43:16.620
- I will circle back.

43:16.620 --> 43:18.570
They probably have eyes on us.

43:18.570 --> 43:19.870
Give you two a head start.

43:21.320 --> 43:23.890
I'll meet up with you at
the power plant, tomorrow.

43:23.890 --> 43:28.890
-  Okay.

43:28.920 --> 43:31.670
(engine revving)

43:34.400 --> 43:35.720
- Where are we going?

43:35.720 --> 43:36.670
- To see Lance.

43:46.230 --> 43:49.150
- It was like a campfire, only controlled.

43:49.150 --> 43:51.060
It's going red, white, red, white,

43:51.060 --> 43:53.590
so bright I could barely look at it.

43:53.590 --> 43:55.130
And if I did for too long,

43:56.230 --> 43:58.010
the brilliance looked like a combination

43:58.010 --> 43:59.800
of red and blue and green.

44:00.700 --> 44:03.400
And it created this incredible
pain behind my eyes.

44:06.050 --> 44:07.050
Running to the light.

44:08.410 --> 44:09.940
The ship.

44:09.940 --> 44:11.510
Knowing Teri was inside,

44:12.550 --> 44:15.010
just staring at it until it went white.

44:17.230 --> 44:18.930
It burned that symbol into my mind.

44:20.840 --> 44:24.820
I don't know, like I suddenly tuned it in.

44:24.820 --> 44:26.520
- Like maybe it was already there?

44:28.050 --> 44:30.070
- You think I've seen it before?

44:30.070 --> 44:31.670
- Not just you.

44:31.670 --> 44:32.500
We all have.

44:32.500 --> 44:34.200
All of us have seen it.

44:34.200 --> 44:35.610
- All of us?

44:35.610 --> 44:37.740
-  All the Unchosen.

44:37.740 --> 44:38.910
- Wait, Unchosen?

44:38.910 --> 44:41.660
- The ones that weren't
taken, like you, like me.

44:42.830 --> 44:45.490
Lance has been finding us
and bringing us together.

44:47.050 --> 44:48.200
- There's more like us?

44:56.250 --> 44:58.060
Someone was taken from you, too?

45:02.490 --> 45:05.850
- Someone was taken from
me, but I don't know who.

45:05.850 --> 45:10.610
I know who took them
and how, I know so much

45:10.610 --> 45:13.010
and that's why Bowie's
been after me ever since.

45:14.760 --> 45:17.510
- He seems to know an
awful lot about all of us,

45:17.510 --> 45:19.650
assuming I'm one of the Unchosens as well.

45:20.550 --> 45:21.770
- Well, according to Lance,

45:21.770 --> 45:23.720
you're the prize jewel of the Unchosen.

45:24.960 --> 45:25.790
- Me?

45:26.740 --> 45:27.570
Why me?

45:30.180 --> 45:31.480
- I'll let Lance tell you.

45:33.220 --> 45:34.710
By the way, how's your head?

45:34.710 --> 45:35.840
Is it still throbbing?

45:36.980 --> 45:37.810
- Won't stop.

45:38.980 --> 45:40.600
- The symbol.

45:40.600 --> 45:41.930
- Yeah, tell me why I keep seeing

45:41.930 --> 45:45.300
this crazy, swirling symbol
in my head everywhere I look.

45:45.300 --> 45:46.130
- It's a signal.

45:47.120 --> 45:48.680
- I don't follow.

45:48.680 --> 45:49.510
- A beacon?

45:49.510 --> 45:51.860
It's how they tell us where to meet them.

45:51.860 --> 45:55.020
- And you see this symbol
everywhere as well?

45:55.020 --> 45:55.850
- Not anymore.

46:01.170 --> 46:04.070
Now I only see it when
I cross paths with you.

46:04.070 --> 46:06.670
(dramatic music)

46:06.670 --> 46:09.390
(beeping)
- AF825 copy.

46:09.390 --> 46:10.910
We're checking to see if
anyone knows who this is.

46:10.910 --> 46:11.740
Stand by.

46:12.990 --> 46:15.940
AF825, can you see the aircraft type?

46:15.940 --> 46:18.330
(beeping)
(static crackling)

46:18.330 --> 46:20.330
(gasps)

46:23.660 --> 46:25.330
- Another nightmare.

46:29.610 --> 46:32.360
(sinister music)

46:55.990 --> 46:57.100
(electricity humming)

46:57.100 --> 46:59.850
(dramatic music)

47:01.700 --> 47:02.530
Martin?

47:12.200 --> 47:13.030
- Teri!

47:15.880 --> 47:18.290
(gun firing)

47:35.130 --> 47:36.800
(screaming)

47:36.800 --> 47:38.940
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

47:38.940 --> 47:40.610
It's okay, hey.

47:40.610 --> 47:41.450
It's a new day.

47:42.320 --> 47:43.470
Your holiday begins now.

47:46.250 --> 47:49.430
I just went back a ways to
see if we were being followed.

47:51.660 --> 47:52.610
I think we're safe.

47:59.300 --> 48:00.210
(sighs)

48:00.210 --> 48:01.700
- We're not safe.

48:01.700 --> 48:02.780
We gotta get outta here.

48:05.900 --> 48:07.000
- It was just a dream.

48:08.440 --> 48:10.330
- We never should have stopped.

48:10.330 --> 48:11.480
- Where are we going?

48:11.480 --> 48:12.900
Joanna?

48:12.900 --> 48:14.500
Okay, okay, wait up.

48:14.500 --> 48:17.520
♪ In the dark world ♪

48:17.520 --> 48:22.520
♪ You need light to bring you home ♪

48:24.290 --> 48:27.290
♪ It's a cold world ♪

48:27.290 --> 48:30.610
♪ I'll never let you be alone ♪

48:30.610 --> 48:34.240
(dog barking)
- So have you seen them?

48:34.240 --> 48:35.210
-  Briefly.

48:35.210 --> 48:37.340
-  Yeah, what do they look like?

48:37.340 --> 48:39.550
- Well, if you really want to know,

48:39.550 --> 48:40.750
there's, first of all,

48:40.750 --> 48:43.080
about a hundred different types of aliens.

48:43.080 --> 48:44.990
- That's where George Lucas got it right.

48:44.990 --> 48:45.820
- Very funny.

48:45.820 --> 48:47.250
- Sorry, Star Wars fan.

48:48.100 --> 48:50.550
- I can only talk about
the three that I've seen.

48:51.600 --> 48:55.310
There's the grays, which
have big heads, long limbs,

48:55.310 --> 48:57.230
about three to five feet tall.

48:57.230 --> 48:59.890
Then there's the masters of grays,

48:59.890 --> 49:01.490
usually aboard a ship.

49:01.490 --> 49:03.860
They're longer limbs, about
seven to eight feet tall.

49:03.860 --> 49:05.210
-  So what's the last type?

49:06.170 --> 49:08.070
- Not technically an alien.

49:09.040 --> 49:10.750
-  Well, not
technically an alien, then what?

49:10.750 --> 49:11.580
It's a?

49:12.820 --> 49:14.290
- A hybrid.

49:14.290 --> 49:15.760
- You mean an alien crossed with--

49:15.760 --> 49:16.810
- A human?

49:16.810 --> 49:18.470
- Jo, how is that possible?

49:18.470 --> 49:20.090
- I'm gonna leave that for Lance.

49:20.090 --> 49:22.890
He was in charge of Catch
Fire and, at the time,

49:22.890 --> 49:25.300
it was about communicating
with the aliens.

49:25.300 --> 49:28.200
- He says he communicates with
aliens and you believe him?

49:30.530 --> 49:31.370
- Martin, wait.

49:36.680 --> 49:39.470
- I do not communicate
with the visitors, Martin.

49:41.780 --> 49:42.930
You do.

49:42.930 --> 49:44.260
- Lance Ivanov,

49:46.540 --> 49:47.540
Martin Fell.

49:51.370 --> 49:52.450
- Lance Ivanov.

49:54.070 --> 49:54.920
I know that name.

49:55.950 --> 49:57.470
Do I know you?

49:57.470 --> 49:58.300
- Not yet.

50:00.510 --> 50:01.340
But you did.

50:05.770 --> 50:09.520
Last of us entering the base,
all safe. Forward.

50:13.060 --> 50:15.810
(dramatic music)

50:22.440 --> 50:23.790
-  From the aliens?

50:24.710 --> 50:28.030
- Would you believe me if I said yes?

50:31.700 --> 50:32.830
- He found the birds.

50:34.160 --> 50:35.650
- So what is this place?

50:37.360 --> 50:38.930
- The safehouse.

50:38.930 --> 50:40.660
Completely off grid.

50:41.700 --> 50:43.940
Self-sufficient in every way.

50:43.940 --> 50:45.690
We draw power from the panels above

50:46.590 --> 50:48.750
and we are hacked into a few aging,

50:48.750 --> 50:51.260
decommissioned military satellites.

50:51.260 --> 50:53.740
- A safehouse means you're in hiding.

50:53.740 --> 50:55.840
Hiding from what, Agent Bowie?

50:55.840 --> 50:58.220
Because you communicate with aliens?

50:58.220 --> 50:59.050
- Visitors.

50:59.050 --> 51:01.720
- But you don't know how to speak to them

51:01.720 --> 51:03.430
or understand their language.

51:03.430 --> 51:05.250
- I was hoping you would tell me.

51:05.250 --> 51:08.170
(beeping)
Humor me.

51:14.330 --> 51:19.080
(birds chirping)
(sighs)

51:43.450 --> 51:46.130
(sinister music)

51:46.130 --> 51:48.580
(booming)

51:48.580 --> 51:51.250
(Martin groans)

51:58.880 --> 52:01.060
Please--
- No, just don't.

52:01.060 --> 52:02.950
- Shh, shh, shh, please.

52:04.560 --> 52:05.820
Please, sit down.

52:07.560 --> 52:09.640
And give it a second try.

52:11.550 --> 52:12.800
We'll leave you alone.

52:39.080 --> 52:40.000
- Martin Fell.

52:41.560 --> 52:42.390
Positive.

52:49.570 --> 52:52.650
Yes, the same one from two years ago.

52:54.080 --> 52:55.410
No, he has the list.

52:57.700 --> 52:59.550
I don't think he realizes what it is.

53:03.860 --> 53:06.280
Of course, his name is on it.

53:09.530 --> 53:12.180
He doesn't remember a thing.

53:12.180 --> 53:14.130
Like all the other Unchosens.

53:17.590 --> 53:22.300
Sir, Operation Catch
Fire is secure for now.

53:26.230 --> 53:27.220
Don't I always?

53:45.310 --> 53:46.570
- We've located the car.

53:56.740 --> 53:58.090
- Welcome to the base camp.

54:03.550 --> 54:06.760
Martin, this is Andrej, my brother.

54:06.760 --> 54:07.720
He watches over me.

54:09.330 --> 54:10.960
- We've been waiting for you.

54:10.960 --> 54:11.790
- We?

54:13.570 --> 54:14.680
- All of the Unchosen.

54:15.630 --> 54:18.670
- Everyone here is what
we used to classify

54:18.670 --> 54:22.200
in Catch Fire program as an Unchosen.

54:22.200 --> 54:23.910
- Yeah, I recognize some faces.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.070
It's all on here.

54:26.070 --> 54:26.910
- Uh-huh.

54:26.910 --> 54:27.830
- Except my wife.

54:30.300 --> 54:32.320
She has a file, just no pictures.

54:32.320 --> 54:34.100
- All these people, like you,

54:35.410 --> 54:38.070
were with a loved one
when they were abducted.

54:39.850 --> 54:41.790
- I'm surprised he doesn't recognize more.

54:41.790 --> 54:42.660
- Yeah.

54:42.660 --> 54:44.260
- Why would I know these people?

54:47.150 --> 54:49.810
Look, I'm not here to join the
hole in the wall gang, okay?

54:49.810 --> 54:52.870
Jo brought me here because your
buddy Ray Bowie is after me.

54:52.870 --> 54:55.290
Because of something I
know or something I saw,

54:55.290 --> 54:57.860
maybe what's in those
files, I really don't care.

54:57.860 --> 55:00.280
- So what do you really
care about, Martin?

55:01.710 --> 55:02.540
- My daughter.

55:04.540 --> 55:06.790
Jo said you could help me find her.

55:06.790 --> 55:07.620
- Yes.

55:14.530 --> 55:16.030
All right.

55:16.030 --> 55:16.860
Let's walk.

55:24.400 --> 55:25.410
-  This is for you.

55:26.270 --> 55:27.100
- Thank you.

55:30.280 --> 55:32.730
-  How did you find Joanna?

55:32.730 --> 55:34.670
-  Online.

55:34.670 --> 55:35.760
I was searching for anything

55:35.760 --> 55:38.470
that could help me make
sense of what was happening.

55:38.470 --> 55:41.020
I guess I just stumbled upon her number.

55:41.020 --> 55:42.740
(Lance laughs)

55:42.740 --> 55:46.120
- You really believe you just
stumbled upon her number?

55:48.200 --> 55:50.880
If you check, I think you will find

55:52.090 --> 55:54.530
it's an unregistered SAT line.

55:56.730 --> 56:00.570
Joanna is not an Unchosen.

56:02.040 --> 56:05.960
I know she thinks she is but she's not.

56:07.830 --> 56:11.430
She's something more.

56:12.280 --> 56:15.190
(dramatic music)

56:15.190 --> 56:17.110
She was abducted.

56:17.110 --> 56:18.660
- What?

56:18.660 --> 56:22.310
- Then she was returned for a reason.

56:22.310 --> 56:25.420
And when she was, her memory was erased.

56:27.710 --> 56:29.560
- So the person she thinks she lost--

56:29.560 --> 56:31.460
-  Was the one she left behind.

56:46.810 --> 56:49.810
- Right, so, so Teri can return too?

56:51.040 --> 56:51.870
How?

56:53.520 --> 56:54.560
- Through you.

56:57.590 --> 56:58.420
- Me?

56:59.870 --> 57:01.960
- You don't just have the ability

57:01.960 --> 57:03.610
to communicate with the visitors.

57:04.610 --> 57:07.220
You've got a special ability

57:07.220 --> 57:10.090
to communicate with one specific visitor.

57:10.090 --> 57:11.240
- How do you know that?

57:13.190 --> 57:16.080
- I've been following
people like you for years.

57:16.980 --> 57:21.230
When Bowie realized that
there were people like you,

57:22.090 --> 57:26.340
civilian interpreters, who are able to

57:26.340 --> 57:28.680
tune into a higher frequency.

57:30.830 --> 57:32.350
- Higher frequency, huh?

57:32.350 --> 57:34.040
That's what you call it?

57:34.040 --> 57:37.200
- Catch Fire was created to document

57:37.200 --> 57:38.940
communication with the aliens.

57:38.940 --> 57:40.930
And we were almost there.

57:40.930 --> 57:43.970
Once we discovered you
and others like you.

57:43.970 --> 57:47.720
- So what happened?
(Lance sighs)

57:47.720 --> 57:48.560
- Bowie

57:50.650 --> 57:53.140
and even the others in that project

57:53.140 --> 57:57.240
began to think that it was a conspiracy,

57:57.240 --> 58:01.080
creating hybrids to act as sleeper cells

58:01.080 --> 58:02.530
amongst our own civilization.

58:04.040 --> 58:05.480
They are here.

58:06.520 --> 58:07.700
And more are coming.

58:08.700 --> 58:10.160
Lots more.
- When?

58:11.470 --> 58:12.810
- We don't know.

58:14.430 --> 58:16.010
Soon.

58:16.010 --> 58:16.840
(laughs)

58:16.840 --> 58:18.460
- So why do you think they're coming, huh?

58:18.460 --> 58:20.040
Why do you think they're coming?

58:20.040 --> 58:23.010
Why do you think they're coming?!

58:23.010 --> 58:25.600
- If you ask Bowie, to invade.

58:25.600 --> 58:27.580
- Well, I didn't ask Bowie, did I?

58:27.580 --> 58:29.510
Did you hear me ask Bowie?

58:29.510 --> 58:30.610
Didn't ask you either.

58:33.610 --> 58:34.440
I'm asking you.

58:36.350 --> 58:41.350
- Well, I think they are
bringing the hybrids home.

58:45.470 --> 58:46.860
- Home?

58:46.860 --> 58:47.690
- Yes.

58:48.590 --> 58:49.430
As simple as that.

58:51.630 --> 58:52.870
A kind of homecoming.

58:56.670 --> 58:58.070
- You ever have to use that?

59:00.160 --> 59:00.990
- Sometimes.

59:07.440 --> 59:09.210
- You mind if I join you?

59:09.210 --> 59:10.210
- Yeah, sit.

59:14.980 --> 59:15.980
- It's warm.

59:23.830 --> 59:25.920
- You told me that you don't remember

59:25.920 --> 59:27.470
a single thing about your wife.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.460
- No, I don't.

59:30.460 --> 59:31.730
(dramatic music)

59:31.730 --> 59:35.480
Can't even remember her face, me or Teri.

59:37.210 --> 59:38.810
- Do you have any photos of her?

59:41.000 --> 59:43.300
- It's like they all
disappeared when she did.

59:52.430 --> 59:53.260
Earlier.

59:54.660 --> 59:56.640
You said that you can see the symbol

59:56.640 --> 59:58.110
whenever we cross paths.

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.930
What did you mean by that?

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:06.650
- You're tuned to a higher frequency.

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.210
I'm sure Lance told you.

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.220
- Yeah, he did.

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.090
- I knew as soon as I heard your voice.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.440
I feel it sometimes too.

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:22.930
It's stronger when I'm near
someone who's high-tuned.

01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:23.770
Like you.

01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:31.360
(gentle music)

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.030
- Sir.

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:13.680
Would you step out of the car, please?

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.620
(scoffs)

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:16.880
- Jacek Palkowski!

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.850
Been waiting a long time to talk to you.

01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:19.930
(grunts)

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:21.360
Find out what he knows.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.660
We're moving at day break.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.680
- Breathe through your nose only.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.480
Not your mouth.

01:01:31.410 --> 01:01:32.350
Close your eyes.

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:37.870
And focus on your breathing.

01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:45.310
Feel the air flowing all the way in,

01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:46.700
to the back of your head.

01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:50.600
Once.

01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:53.990
(inhales) Take a deep breath.

01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:57.190
Twice.

01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:58.730
(inhales) Inhale.

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:01.870
And exhale, good.

01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:07.690
And you will find your nose moving

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:10.320
in the shape of the symbol.

01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:17.050
Now, you are tuned in.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.190
Keep breathing

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:28.200
as your nose begins to move
in a figure eight pattern,

01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:34.940
left to right, right to left.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.400
Up and down.

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:43.420
Now, you are connected
to your higher self.

01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:48.760
And keep on breathing and finally,

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:53.670
you will feel that your
nose starts to describe

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.110
the number one.

01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:59.450
Yes.

01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:01.400
Exactly.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
And this number one is always
affirmation to any question.

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:15.860
Now go ahead, Martin.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:29.080
- Teri.

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:39.100
Where are you, monkey?

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:41.770
It's me.

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:44.680
Where are you?

01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:57.150
Please, help me remember.

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:06.170
Help me remember.

01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:13.710
(exhales)

01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:17.840
- Yes.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:21.630
Yes.

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:25.800
What you have just experienced
is called telepathy.

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:29.050
You got it.

01:04:33.310 --> 01:04:37.970
(light music)
(buzzing)

01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:52.320
(tires screeching)

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:14.500
(radio chattering)

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:18.420
-  Hold your fire
until I give the signal.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.660
-  If you want to,
you can close your eyes.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.440
(humming)

01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:48.900
(humming)

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.740
-  I'm in position.

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:04.930
(dramatic music)

01:06:04.930 --> 01:06:07.100
(beeping)

01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:19.040
(humming)

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:32.120
- They're coming.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.780
(intense music)

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.560
- It's time to go.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.390
- Not yet.

01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:44.160
Buy me some time, Andrej.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.300
You two go.

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:47.500
-  Let's go.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:52.500
-  Hold your fire
until I give the signal.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:02.690
(explosion booming)
(man screams)

01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:05.280
(guns firing)
(man screams)

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.610
-  Come on!

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.980
(guns firing)

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:22.970
(guns firing)
(glass shattering)

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:23.850
(dramatic music)

01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:24.690
- Go, go!

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.360
(whistles)
- Come on, come on.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.110
(glass shattering)

01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:44.130
(gun firing)

01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:48.350
(woman screams)

01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:55.050
-  And to the left, let's go.

01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:04.480
We will hold them off for a while.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.440
- It's Bowie.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.270
How'd he find us?

01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:07.110
- He's here for me.

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.210
Geocaching.

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:10.040
- What about it?

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:13.550
- Just follow the sign that
means something to you.

01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:14.380
Okay?

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.200
The rest are decoys.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.140
Let's move on.

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:18.240
-  Go, go, go!

01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:21.399
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:24.390
It emerges on the other
side of the solar field.

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:27.550
Once you go, you will seal the hatch.

01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:29.630
It's your only option for escape.

01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:30.460
Good luck.

01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:35.080
Seal the hatch.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:38.080
(door locking)
Good.

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:41.649
(guns firing)

01:08:48.330 --> 01:08:50.080
-  Clear, clear!

01:09:16.090 --> 01:09:18.340
(thudding)

01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:23.000
(grunting)

01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:42.410
- It's nice to see you, Lance.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.930
(grunting)

01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:56.400
- Let him go.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:08.930
- Don't do it.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.860
- All right, go.

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:21.730
I'm not gonna say it again, go.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:33.280
- She's still alive.

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.870
- What did you say?

01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:45.620
- There is always another way.

01:10:53.410 --> 01:10:56.250
(engine rumbling)

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:06.550
-  What is this place?

01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:08.550
-  I don't know.

01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:12.780
So what's geocaching?

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:13.610
- It's a game.

01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:17.540
We used to play it with
Teri when she was a kid.

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:22.540
They hide things like money,
prizes, pictures, books.

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.860
And they post the exact location,

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.710
longitude and latitude up on websites

01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:30.710
and you go to these sites
and you use the coordinates

01:11:30.710 --> 01:11:31.710
like a treasure map.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.190
It's fun.

01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:40.050
-  So what did he say?

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:42.680
Follow the clues that
mean something to you.

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.260
- Yeah, right here.

01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:51.080
No, no, damn, come on you.

01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:54.540
There we go.

01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:56.360
No.
- Nope.

01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:59.120
- Uh, no, no.
- Mm.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.770
-  There we go.

01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:05.470
The international sign for geocaching.

01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:06.670
- Looks like the symbol.

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:13.140
(dramatic music)

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.810
-  Oh, crap.

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:18.980
(explosion booming)

01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:39.200
- Let's get after 'em.

01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.090
- Okay.

01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:48.180
(Martin grunts)

01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:55.840
-  It's taking
us deeper into the woods.

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:07.840
(Martin exhales)

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:11.290
- It's on the other side of this wall.

01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:14.310
- We can try and climb it.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.400
- Come on, there has to be a way in.

01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:26.540
Come on.

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:30.220
(groans)

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:32.720
(baby crying)

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:37.170
- You okay?

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.340
- Do we go east

01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:43.650
(baby crying)

01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:45.080
or is the entrance west.

01:13:49.210 --> 01:13:52.850
(angelic singing)

01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:55.030
I know where to go!

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:56.530
Come on, this way.

01:13:59.450 --> 01:14:01.620
(buzzing)

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.680
(machinery whirring and beeping)

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:17.030
- These are coordinates to locations, no?

01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:20.330
- Yeah, about a hundred of them.

01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:22.610
- Well, I only need the one they went to.

01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:24.970
They're on foot and the tunnel goes north.

01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:28.260
So I suggest we start with
the ones closest to there.

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.560
Take me to the nearest site on this map.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:33.350
-  Okay.

01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:38.350
(engine starting)
(dramatic music)

01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:53.420
(groans)

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.270
- There.

01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:17.320
Come on.

01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:30.100
(dramatic music)

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:54.510
- How close are we to these coordinates?

01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:57.060
-  Another two clicks
into the mountains, sir.

01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:08.110
-  I know this place.

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:12.850
-  It's where they used to live.

01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:13.900
Where they were kept.

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:15.890
- Where who was kept?

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.490
- I'm starting to remember.

01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:23.440
Lance was right, I've met him before.

01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:25.760
I've been here before.

01:16:27.570 --> 01:16:30.570
(voices whispering)

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:08.050
- Sir, what's going on?

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.410
- Blow the door, now.

01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:18.160
(dramatic music)

01:17:40.230 --> 01:17:41.060
- Teri?

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:42.990
Teri?

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.790
Teri?

01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:50.470
I'm looking for my daughter.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.430
I know you.

01:17:55.650 --> 01:17:57.150
You know where my daughter is.

01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:59.100
Her name's...

01:18:04.530 --> 01:18:05.360
Teri?

01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:08.700
Teri!

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:11.450
(dramatic music)

01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:19.090
Are you, are you, are you hurt?

01:18:19.090 --> 01:18:20.420
- I'm fine, Dad.
- Are you okay?

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:21.680
- I'm okay.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:23.860
-  I can't lose you again, monkey.

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:24.690
Oh my God.

01:18:25.530 --> 01:18:27.690
(booming)

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:31.930
- Let's go.

01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:44.380
- He's waiting for you, Dad.

01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:45.260
- No, no, I'm,

01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.610
I'm not leaving you.
- Go!

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:48.750
Go.

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:53.670
Just go!

01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:58.400
- Where are you going?

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.410
- We will make sure your time

01:18:59.410 --> 01:19:01.660
with Alpha I is not interrupted.

01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:07.830
- Hey, Jo.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.070
It's okay.

01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:14.520
I know what we have to do, it's okay.

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.930
Come on, come on.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:23.240
(voices whispering)

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.350
- What is this place?

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.950
- It's where the UN used to keep them.

01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:35.890
- Them?

01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:57.370
- Do you see that?

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:19.020
(voices whispering)

01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:23.600
- I know her.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.260
That's Flora.

01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:28.830
Abducted March 2004, at the age of 13.

01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:30.470
From Grand Junction, Colorado.

01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:37.090
(dramatic music)

01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:44.040
(whirring)

01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:11.910
(whooshing)

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:33.000
- You do not remember your
time with me here, before.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:33.830
- No.

01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:36.970
Tell me.

01:22:36.970 --> 01:22:38.170
Please help me remember.

01:22:40.090 --> 01:22:42.830
(dramatic music)

01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:44.630
(baby crying)

01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:45.460
- Teri?

01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:48.900
You're alive.

01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:55.720
- Robert?

01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:59.220
-  Throughout the universe,

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.150
(baby crying)

01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:07.000
the grays have been
coming here since 1947,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.140
when their first attempt to land on earth

01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:10.890
resulted in a crash at Roswell.

01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:14.900
We brokered a deal
between humans and grays.

01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:17.840
Technology for humanity.

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:24.180
- You're Fell's daughter.

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:25.270
Shoot her now!

01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:30.270
- No!
(gun firing)

01:23:31.730 --> 01:23:34.230
(guns firing)

01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:51.830
- They heralded in the age of technology

01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:54.400
while you slowly brought
them back from extinction

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.770
by giving them hybrids.

01:23:58.790 --> 01:24:00.870
(crying)

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:08.120
(guns firing)

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:12.600
(rumbling)
(triumphant music)

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:15.020
(gun firing)

01:24:19.330 --> 01:24:21.490
(yelling)

01:24:42.650 --> 01:24:45.560
(glass shattering)

01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:51.290
(yelling)

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.730
A life for the chip.

01:24:57.730 --> 01:25:01.200
Leading to fiber optics,
computers, internet.

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:04.670
But the council of ten
didn't trust in the deal,

01:25:04.670 --> 01:25:08.020
which eventually led to
certain human factions

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.300
pursuing the hybrids.

01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:11.080
And that's where you came in.

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.960
- And places like this?

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:15.820
- Yes.
- Hidden in the woods?

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:19.220
- A place to reunite hybrid families.

01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:21.630
Empathy and emotion is
a necessary sustenance

01:25:21.630 --> 01:25:25.880
for a part-human child,
which the grays lack.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:28.700
- Which made them dangerous
to those who were afraid,

01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:32.110
creating a need for a human
mother to stabilize the child

01:25:32.110 --> 01:25:34.010
out of fear that otherwise the hybrids

01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:35.720
would become easy to manipulate.

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:38.900
-  Yes.

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:40.900
So we had to keep them hidden.

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:43.690
Hidden from those who did not
understand our intentions.

01:25:43.690 --> 01:25:45.810
-  Who wanted to
control the power of the hybrids

01:25:45.810 --> 01:25:46.920
no matter the cost.

01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:49.970
- Yes.

01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:52.060
(crying)

01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:55.770
You are both beginning to remember.

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:02.380
- We're both?
(dramatic music)

01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:05.100
-  We choose to forget.

01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:06.860
- You mean Jo is Anna?

01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:05.340
(exhales)

01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:11.530
We chose to have our memories erased.

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:20.420
We chose to.

01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:23.430
Both of us, Anna.

01:27:27.130 --> 01:27:30.120
To protect everyone in our lives.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.750
Everyone that we cared about.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.480
(whooshing)

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:44.480
(sighs)

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:13.430
Oh my God.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.580
I've missed you so much, Anna.

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:23.590
- I miss you every day of my life.

01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:38.230
- That night you were taken.

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:40.560
- Was a long, long time ago.

01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:45.000
I know we discovered that you
tuned into a higher frequency.

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:49.250
- You couldn't have children.

01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:52.670
Yet you came back with a child.

01:28:52.670 --> 01:28:54.320
-  Teri was our gift.

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:57.330
-  It was decided
to keep your family intact

01:28:57.330 --> 01:28:58.190
no matter what.

01:28:59.890 --> 01:29:03.500
You and the others, with
your ability to translate.

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.070
-  We didn't
know that our own kind

01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:07.100
would come after us for it.

01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:08.420
-  We suspected.

01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:12.240
Human emotion often leads
to human miscalculations.

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.750
-  Bowie was
getting closer and closer

01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:17.250
and even with Lance
promising to protect her,

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.900
we knew he would eventually come for Teri.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.040
-  We asked you to hide her.

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:30.360
-  Hide her in plain sight.

01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:31.620
-  But we made sure we always

01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:33.420
had a way back to each other.

01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:35.010
- Yeah.

01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:36.010
To remember.

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:54.320
- There is always another way.

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:08.840
I will always know you.

01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:13.150
Always.

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.400
(crying)

01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:30.620
- There is always another way.

01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:31.450
Always.

01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:58.540
(dramatic music)

01:31:19.770 --> 01:31:22.100
There is always another way.

01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.820
- Always.

01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:38.400
-  There is always another way.

01:31:53.770 --> 01:31:56.880
- I don't remember the
drive being so beautiful.

01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:00.870
- Yeah, you always loved this drive.

01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:07.960
- How much longer until we get there?

01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:13.280
- You sound just like your mother.

01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:18.940
- I love you, Daddy.

01:32:20.370 --> 01:32:22.670
Can't wait to see the cottage.

01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:04.350

01:33:15.550 --> 01:33:17.720
