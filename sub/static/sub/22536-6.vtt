WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.195
Previously on
crisis...
_ We know that
Cla director Widener

00:03.200 --> 00:05.168
Is a close friend.

00:05.170 --> 00:07.024
How do you know me?
Francis (distorted):
We know everything.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.189
About all of you.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.599
To save your daughter's life,

00:09.610 --> 00:10.838
What will you do?

00:10.840 --> 00:12.432
(gunshot)
hey!

00:12.440 --> 00:14.203
What are you gonna do
with these soldiers?

00:14.210 --> 00:15.677
(distorted):
Ask your partner's sister.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.046
Let me come to you,
we can talk.

00:18.050 --> 00:20.041
You have those soldiers.
That's what you want.

00:20.050 --> 00:21.449
Meg:
The project went bad.

00:21.450 --> 00:23.509
I had to keep my
company clean of it.

00:23.520 --> 00:26.284
Jonas was connected
to It, so I...

00:26.290 --> 00:27.689
Severed that
relationship.

00:27.690 --> 00:29.112
Does your husband know
you were screwing him?

00:29.130 --> 00:30.449
I tracked him down.

00:30.460 --> 00:31.950
I shouldn't have
pushed you.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.587
It's better I know
the truth, right?

00:35.130 --> 00:36.495
This one here

00:36.500 --> 00:37.967
Is not good
enough for you

00:37.970 --> 00:39.369
To even look at.

00:39.370 --> 00:40.860
That you're not good enough.

00:45.470 --> 00:46.801
He will kill
you, Ian.

00:46.810 --> 00:47.970
He will kill you.

00:47.980 --> 00:48.969
Dunn, look
at this.

00:48.980 --> 00:50.572
These are those
two soldiers.

00:50.580 --> 00:52.047
Dunn:
These are the two
guys who are gonna

00:52.050 --> 00:53.472
Kill innocent
people In d.C.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.573
So is gibson
the hostage,

00:55.580 --> 00:57.070
Or the kidnapper?

00:57.090 --> 00:59.411
There's a downed power line
up ahead.

00:59.420 --> 01:01.308
Gonna hold you fellas up here
just a minute.

01:01.320 --> 01:04.255
(two gunshots)

01:04.260 --> 01:06.057
Reporter:
Day ﬁve of the bal/ara’ school
kidnapp/hg.

01:06.060 --> 01:07.584
Three students
have been released

01:07.600 --> 01:09.022
And now there are
unconﬁrmed reports

01:09.030 --> 01:10.395
That the death of
a ha/lard parent

01:10.400 --> 01:13.289
At the dc? was
kidnapp/ng-re/ated.

01:16.940 --> 01:19.261
Keep the ivs going.
We hold them here for a day,

01:19.280 --> 01:22.272
Then we take 'em to gibson
when we know we're clear.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.032
We won't be able
to get a Signal out,

01:24.050 --> 01:26.245
But the cia won't be able
to see under the power lines.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.945
I'll take first watch.
You good?

01:27.950 --> 01:29.349
If you call being in
the middle of nowhere

01:29.350 --> 01:31.682
In a metal box with
two black ops soldiers

01:31.690 --> 01:33.180
The cia is desperately
trying to find good...

01:33.190 --> 01:34.487
I'm great.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.021
Olsen:
All right.

01:44.030 --> 01:45.861
You're on speaker.
I'm here with legal.

01:45.870 --> 01:47.792
Just so it's official
and none of us

01:47.800 --> 01:49.768
Go to jail, we will do this
once for the record.

01:49.770 --> 01:51.032
State your names.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.905
Agent marcus finley.

01:52.910 --> 01:54.138
Agent susan dunn.

01:54.140 --> 01:55.903
Now, after I sign off on this,

01:55.910 --> 01:57.468
We will begin an operation

01:57.480 --> 01:59.903
To lure a kidnapper
or kidnappers

01:59.920 --> 02:01.410
Out of hiding,

02:01.420 --> 02:03.274
Using information seized
last night in a raid

02:03.290 --> 02:05.383
On the residence
of jonas clarenbach.

02:05.390 --> 02:07.915
And what's the nature
of this information?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.979
Dunn:
Files having to do with
the central intelligence agency.

02:09.990 --> 02:12.049
We know the kidnappers
are fixated on the cia

02:12.060 --> 02:13.288
And we have
reason to believe

02:13.300 --> 02:14.722
They will come
for these files.

02:14.730 --> 02:17.119
And have those cia files
been processed yet?

02:17.130 --> 02:18.666
Finley:
Not yet.

02:20.470 --> 02:22.438
My agents understand
that those files

02:22.440 --> 02:24.067
May contain information

02:24.070 --> 02:25.731
That we don't necessarily
know the meaning of.

02:25.740 --> 02:27.731
And you're willing to expose
these unvetted files

02:27.740 --> 02:29.139
To the kidnappers?

02:29.150 --> 02:31.072
Finley:
A dummy file

02:31.080 --> 02:32.445
Would tip off
the kidnapper.

02:32.450 --> 02:34.441
If he comes for it
and get spooked,

02:34.450 --> 02:36.008
He never goes back
to where he came from.

02:36.020 --> 02:38.079
We need to set the trap,
follow him back to the kids.

02:38.090 --> 02:40.285
And how will he know
the file is in your possession?

02:40.290 --> 02:42.758
There's a drain on the ballard
school surveillance cameras.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.751
Untraceable, but we
believe the kidnapper

02:44.760 --> 02:46.751
Has been monitoring our
daily parent meetings there.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.161
Du_nn:
Sir?

02:53.540 --> 02:54.893
Are we a go?

02:59.110 --> 03:00.407
Do it.

03:09.220 --> 03:11.438
(phone rings)

03:12.450 --> 03:13.986
What's up?

03:13.990 --> 03:15.287
Go on, I'll catch up.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.234
Beth ann,
do you trust me?

03:32.540 --> 03:34.576
I know you don't
trust anybody, but...

03:34.580 --> 03:36.878
Do you want
to trust me?

03:36.880 --> 03:38.142
Yeah.

03:38.150 --> 03:39.401
Yeah, Id...
I do.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.513
I'm gonna get us
all out of here.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.272
What? How?

03:44.550 --> 03:47.041
I'm gonna set
this place on fire.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.595
(school bell ringing)

03:56.600 --> 03:58.921
(talking quietly)

03:58.930 --> 04:00.761
You all right?

04:00.770 --> 04:02.362
I'm fine.

04:02.370 --> 04:05.168
Something to do with
that text you got?

04:05.170 --> 04:07.604
No.

04:08.780 --> 04:10.179
Okay.

04:10.180 --> 04:13.172
Get ready; they're
almost all here.

04:25.460 --> 04:27.655
(computer beeps)

04:30.130 --> 04:32.121
No, it's simple.
When I want to see you,

04:32.130 --> 04:34.963
I'll post a review
on the message board.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.461
Same when you
want to see me.

04:37.470 --> 04:38.801
(typing)

04:44.550 --> 04:46.541
Beth ann_: _
Look out, a guard is coming.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.552
Okay. He's gone.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.960
After you start
the fire, then what?

05:04.970 --> 05:06.289
Smoke.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.461
I smash a window,
let the smoke out.

05:08.470 --> 05:10.836
Maybe someone out
in the world sees it
and calls 911.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.330
Maybe it'll get you
beaten up like jin liao.

05:12.340 --> 05:13.602
Maybe it'll get us all killed.

05:13.610 --> 05:15.931
I get that you're scared.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.237
It's okay.

05:18.850 --> 05:21.318
But I'm doing this
whether you help me or not.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.480
The fbi's back at ballard,
briefing the parents.

05:28.490 --> 05:31.084
Dunn:
This is gonna be rough.

05:31.090 --> 05:32.648
Finley:
Yeah, with no information,

05:32.660 --> 05:34.082
It's gonna be hard

05:34.100 --> 05:35.829
Not to think the worst
about their kids.

05:35.830 --> 05:37.991
Maybe we should
just tell them.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.797
Tell them what?

05:39.800 --> 05:42.030
That we think
one of their own
might be involved.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.359
The file we took
from clarenbach

05:43.370 --> 05:45.008
Needs to be
processed first.

05:45.010 --> 05:46.363
We need to
figure out

05:46.380 --> 05:47.938
What gibson has to do
with those soldiers.

05:47.940 --> 05:50.602
Finley: How long before
the techs get through

05:50.610 --> 05:52.669
Processing
that file?

05:53.720 --> 05:55.870
What?

05:55.880 --> 05:58.678
I didn't exactly
turn it in yet.

05:58.690 --> 05:59.839
I still have it.

05:59.860 --> 06:00.884
Finley:
In your possession?

06:00.890 --> 06:02.357
Dunn:
In my apartment.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.487
Just hear me out. _
Okay, once that file goes in

06:04.490 --> 06:05.718
For processing,
it's in the system.

06:05.730 --> 06:07.027
Once it's in
the system,

06:07.030 --> 06:08.452
The cia knows
we have it.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.849
They're only gonna
get in our way.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.191
12 hours.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.293
We work that file,
just the two of us,

06:15.300 --> 06:17.768
For 12 hours, and
then we turn it over.

06:19.740 --> 06:21.799
Let's get this
done first.

06:22.810 --> 06:24.209
Excuse me!

06:24.210 --> 06:26.303
Would everyone
please take their seats.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.548
Yeah, open a line for me.

06:27.550 --> 06:30.576
(line ringing)

06:30.590 --> 06:33.411
Koz, I need you to leave
those soldiers immediately.

06:33.420 --> 06:34.682
We have a higher priority now.

06:34.690 --> 06:36.885
It's not that I can't do it,

06:36.890 --> 06:39.654
It's that this_is an extra that
was not preVIously discussed.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.651
I'm acting on new information.

06:41.660 --> 06:43.696
I'll tell you what, why don't
you give me the last four digits

06:43.700 --> 06:45.190
Of that swiss bank account

06:45.200 --> 06:47.088
_So I can do more than
just look at my money?

06:47.100 --> 06:49.239
Ha. That's for later.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.232
But for now, I can offer you
something better.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.764
Koz:
Yeah? What?

06:53.780 --> 06:56.533
One of the feds is the man
who killed your brother.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.007
This time, you can kill him.

07:07.890 --> 07:10.256
(door squeaks open)

07:25.810 --> 07:27.801
You guys almost finished?

07:27.810 --> 07:29.277
Packed away, ready to go.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.929
Here are
your keys.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.440
Good luck.
Thank you.

07:46.660 --> 07:48.821
All equipment is in place

07:48.830 --> 07:51.321
And operational.

07:56.670 --> 07:58.968
We good?

07:58.970 --> 08:00.528
We're good.
We're up.
Get out of there.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.148
(phone rings)

08:15.160 --> 08:17.310
Don't stop.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.979
(over earpiece):
Get out of there!

08:18.990 --> 08:20.423
The kidnapper's people
could be there any second.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.461
What can I do
for you, meg?
You can get my
daughter back.

08:30.470 --> 08:33.109
How, exactly,
am I going to do that?

08:33.110 --> 08:35.533
By telling me
how I'm involved
in the kidnapping.

08:36.540 --> 08:37.871
What have you been doing?

08:37.880 --> 08:39.507
I just have to watch the news

08:39.520 --> 08:41.408
To see that it has
something to do with the cia.

08:42.950 --> 08:45.043
So you tell me
how I'm connected

08:45.050 --> 08:46.312
To amber being taken.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.639
You don't want to know that.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.548
Let me be the judge

08:49.560 --> 08:51.721
Of what I don't want to know.

08:51.730 --> 08:53.186
If it compromises me,

08:53.200 --> 08:54.519
I'd have thought
that would make you glad.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.059
(gunfire)

09:07.410 --> 09:08.900
These soldiers
were part of

09:08.910 --> 09:10.673
An advanced training protocol.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.045
They were given a drug

09:12.050 --> 09:13.802
To help them survive
brutal conditions.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.549
An unexpected side effect

09:15.550 --> 09:17.245
Is that it repressed emotions...

09:17.250 --> 09:19.081
Empathy.

09:19.090 --> 09:20.409
Those soldiers knew
what they were doing,

09:20.420 --> 09:21.751
They just didn't care.

09:23.190 --> 09:24.418
I ordered
that drug, meg.

09:24.430 --> 09:27.183
Your company made it.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.350
This massacre brought to you
by porter pearce.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.225
So the kidnapping
is payback for that?

09:31.230 --> 09:32.925
The kidnapping
is collateral damage.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.488
I want the name
of the kidnapper.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.738
Maybe I don't know.

09:37.740 --> 09:39.901
Don't screw
With me, gabe.

09:39.910 --> 09:41.878
You're under attack,
you know your enemy.

09:41.880 --> 09:44.098
I'm supposed to
just give it to you,

09:44.110 --> 09:46.169
Or are we going
to do business here?

09:49.950 --> 09:52.418
I have something
you want.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.519
(lock clicks)

10:07.900 --> 10:10.095
What if there are people
living nearby

10:10.110 --> 10:12.533
And they don't even
know we're here?

10:12.540 --> 10:14.633
They're fighting about
walking their dog...

10:14.640 --> 10:18.406
Or who put the empty box
of cereal back in the cabinet.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.401
Ian, if we were
still out there,

10:20.420 --> 10:22.945
You would've
told me already.

10:22.950 --> 10:24.474
You used to_ tell
me everything.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.310
What do you want to know?

10:26.320 --> 10:29.756
Why'd you try and
attack that guard?

10:29.760 --> 10:31.785
What happened in that
room with you and amber?

10:31.790 --> 10:33.951
What happened?

10:33.960 --> 10:35.655
I found out what I am.

10:39.930 --> 10:42.467
You're high, aren't you?

10:42.470 --> 10:44.290
You gonna tell me to stop?

10:44.310 --> 10:46.767
No.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.476
But do those pills
really make you feel better?

10:51.410 --> 10:52.900
Just feel less.

10:55.420 --> 10:56.512
You remember when you asked me

10:56.520 --> 10:58.112
IfI wanted
to run away with you?

10:58.120 --> 11:00.418
Feels like a hundred years ago.

11:00.420 --> 11:03.253
If we got out of here tomorrow,
would you still want to go?

11:04.430 --> 11:06.182
I don't know.

11:07.530 --> 11:10.590
See, that's the thing, beth ann.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.192
Kyle and your dad--

11:12.200 --> 11:13.929
Thing's got better
in here for you.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.191
Not for me.

11:27.210 --> 11:30.668
What's up with you?
You give us a minute?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.385
You've been half
here all day.

11:32.390 --> 11:34.449
We're on an operation,
and you stop in the middle

11:34.460 --> 11:37.020
Of it like you forgot what
you're doing. I need to know

11:37.030 --> 11:39.453
If your head's
in the game.
It's my problem,

11:39.460 --> 11:41.223
Not yours.
We're partners!
It's my problem!

11:41.230 --> 11:43.050
Because that's what partners do?

11:43.070 --> 11:45.959
It's an option
you might want to explore.

11:54.640 --> 11:58.076
Texts from unknown caller
two hours ago.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.638
"I know
you're amber's mother."

11:59.650 --> 12:03.643
Four minutes ago:
"you're going to help me."

12:03.650 --> 12:05.208
If this is the kidnapper...

12:05.220 --> 12:08.018
Then I'm just another parent
they want to use on a mission.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.578
You text back?

12:09.590 --> 12:12.718
Yeah. No answer.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.220
This operation, we still go?

12:16.230 --> 12:19.529
And if they ask me to do
something in the middle?

12:19.530 --> 12:20.667
What if they do?

12:20.670 --> 12:22.490
What if they ask you
to do something today?

12:22.500 --> 12:23.899
You choose your job
or your daughter?

12:23.910 --> 12:26.606
I don't know.

12:26.610 --> 12:27.929
Come on, dunn.
She's your daughter.

12:27.940 --> 12:31.432
What do you do?
I don't know. I...

12:31.450 --> 12:33.975
I don't know
what a mother would do.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.347
I've never been one.

12:39.390 --> 12:41.483
I've never even been
an aunt.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.585
Finley, if I said
I'd know how

12:44.590 --> 12:49.050
I'd feel
when I got that call...

12:49.060 --> 12:50.527
It'd be a lie.

12:53.630 --> 12:57.066
But we can't cancel
this mi55ion.

12:57.070 --> 13:00.506
You know, it's the best shot
at finding those kids, so...

13:02.880 --> 13:04.233
I'm gonna step off.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.548
No, you do not do that. We go.

13:06.550 --> 13:09.474
We go.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.539
But we trace these texts.

13:11.550 --> 13:13.313
What are you doing?

13:13.320 --> 13:14.742
We put this text trace
through the system

13:14.760 --> 13:16.910
And the fbi finds out you lied,
you're gone from the bureau.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.057
So again, what are you doing?

13:19.060 --> 13:21.449
There's more than one system we
can run this on. I know a guy.

13:21.460 --> 13:22.620
You know a guy?

13:22.630 --> 13:25.326
I was a cop here.

13:31.940 --> 13:33.931
That's one
of the kidnappers.

13:33.940 --> 13:36.238
He was one of the fake
state troopers at the abduction.

13:36.240 --> 13:39.801
We're live, people.
This is it!

13:44.190 --> 13:45.543
Target moving.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.530
Images received.
It's running behind us.

14:02.540 --> 14:03.996
Start your decryptions,
please.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.763
There's... Nothing here
to decrypt.

14:11.010 --> 14:13.274
This doesn't seem
to be a cia file at all.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.670
This just ties you and
clarenbach to those soldiers.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.011
No, this isn't a case file.

14:19.020 --> 14:21.614
This is evidence.

14:21.620 --> 14:24.612
Jonas is collecting evidence.

14:24.630 --> 14:28.623
I guess he's not on board with
widener's little horror show.

14:28.630 --> 14:32.862
Jonas wants
to be a whistle-blower.

14:32.870 --> 14:34.963
What are you hiding,
jonas?

14:36.640 --> 14:39.029
And where are you hiding it?

14:49.750 --> 14:52.719
Here.
What's this here?

14:52.720 --> 14:55.712
Looks like blood chemistry
charts for the two soldiers.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.883
Got about
15-20 pages of it.

14:58.890 --> 15:00.255
Jonas is a chemist.

15:00.260 --> 15:01.750
That's how
a chemist writes code.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.227
Run decryptions on that.

15:04.730 --> 15:06.220
A map.

15:06.230 --> 15:08.528
How long will it take
to lock down?

15:08.540 --> 15:10.997
Could be half an hour,
maybe an hour.

15:11.010 --> 15:14.309
Send someone to find me
when you know what
it's a map of.

15:19.110 --> 15:20.372
He's finished with the file,
finley.

15:20.380 --> 15:22.314
You better get back here.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.599
Bogey contacted.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.429
I don't see anything yet.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.931
Working on it.
The tracker's infrared,
so we won't see anything

15:44.940 --> 15:46.635
Until we patch
into hq's feed.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.039
Hold on.

15:55.420 --> 15:56.978
The drone has it, sir.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.811
Stay back.
Leave him lots of space.

15:59.820 --> 16:01.685
Let him lead us to the kids.

16:11.430 --> 16:14.991
You look new to d.C., sir.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.729
Let me recommend
a program for you.

16:16.740 --> 16:18.230
Anything on clarenbach yet?

16:18.240 --> 16:19.730
No, nothing yet.

16:19.740 --> 16:20.900
Keep listening.

16:20.910 --> 16:22.332
Keep listening?

16:22.340 --> 16:24.069
_ There's a lot of
movmg pieces here, gabe.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.446
You don't expect them all
to stay lined up, do ya?

16:26.450 --> 16:29.419
It's your job
to keep 'em lined up.
Indeed, it is.

16:29.420 --> 16:33.481
But it'd be an awful lot
easier if you'd stop
shaking the board.

16:33.490 --> 16:35.708
Just keep listening.

16:59.950 --> 17:01.440
Target heading inside
the gas station.

17:01.450 --> 17:03.145
We have a visual
on the eXIts, Sir.

17:03.150 --> 17:04.947
_ All units_ _
maintain p05ition.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.468
You okay?

17:19.470 --> 17:21.358
Definitely not okay.

17:28.140 --> 17:30.176
A friend is going
to try and escape.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.807
VVho?

17:31.810 --> 17:33.471
I can't tell you.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.608
Beth ann, look at me.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.288
YOU need to trust someone.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.651
Kyle devore.

17:49.660 --> 17:52.424
The president's son?

17:52.430 --> 17:54.227
I didn't know you were friends.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.696
We are.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.895
We-we weren't, but we are now.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.207
What do I do, dad?

17:59.210 --> 18:01.508
He's going
to get himself killed.

18:01.510 --> 18:04.729
And he thinks that he needs
to be a leader like his dad.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.901
And then he trusted me
not to say anything, and...

18:09.380 --> 18:12.087
Sometimes you need to save
people from themselves.

18:12.090 --> 18:13.648
How?

18:16.020 --> 18:18.181
Every situation requires

18:18.190 --> 18:21.387
A different
and very speCIfic answer.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.119
Just try to understand
yourfnend,

18:24.130 --> 18:26.564
What he really needs...

18:26.570 --> 18:29.289
And find a way to
give it to him.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.939
The kid's smart to trust you,
beth ann.

18:33.210 --> 18:35.474
You'll figure it out.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.279
It's funny.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.043
What?

18:44.050 --> 18:47.816
A week ago you wouldn't have
come to me with this.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.801
We're going to get her.
It's a good plan.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.471
We just follow this guy
right back to where she is.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.759
Wait a minute.
He went in5ide to pay.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.455
Why would you go inside

19:25.460 --> 19:27.655
When you know everybody's
looking for you?

19:27.660 --> 19:29.252
These guys can hack
into the cia.

19:29.260 --> 19:30.955
They can't steal a credit card
to pay at the pump?

19:30.970 --> 19:32.289
Why gas up at all?

19:32.300 --> 19:33.619
You pull off a kidnapping
like this,

19:33.640 --> 19:35.096
You're smart enough
to gas up first.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.846
Target is traveling again.
Repeat: Target is traveling.

19:48.780 --> 19:51.169
We follow him
or we check out
that gas station.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.682
Target is in motion.
All units go now.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.311
Man (over radio):
Target is approaching
destination.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.049
Advance team one,
take your position.

20:36.560 --> 20:39.723
Sir, screen five,
we've id'd vehicles
used at the kidnapping.

20:47.870 --> 20:50.179
(mechanical whirring)

21:17.800 --> 21:20.963
Who is that kid?
I want an id now.
Checking.

21:29.780 --> 21:31.645
(computer beeping)
hold on.

21:31.650 --> 21:34.778
Got it. That's taylor bennet,
positive id.

21:34.790 --> 21:37.486
Repeat: We have
a positive id on a hostage.

21:45.500 --> 21:48.469
Empty.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.893
(cell phone ringing)

21:53.440 --> 21:55.874
Dunn.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.240
They found the kids.

22:04.650 --> 22:05.981
Man:
Team two, you're go
for approach.

22:13.690 --> 22:15.351
Four minutes till
he's back.

22:15.360 --> 22:16.691
You ready?

22:16.700 --> 22:18.656
No.

22:24.540 --> 22:26.599
What the hell?

22:28.040 --> 22:29.473
It's soaking wet.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.539
Did you do this?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.627
Hrt_ commander:
Hrt in p05ition, Sir.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.096
Hrt is go.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.619
(high-pitched alarm chirping)

23:27.600 --> 23:30.637
(alarm wailing)

23:32.040 --> 23:34.406
(alarm wailing)

23:45.350 --> 23:46.544
Sir?
What?

23:46.550 --> 23:47.949
It's corban bennet.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.188
VVho?
Taylor bennet's father.

23:49.190 --> 23:50.418
His watch team just called.

23:50.430 --> 23:51.681
He's missing.

23:51.690 --> 23:52.918
How long?

23:54.200 --> 23:56.521
What the hell is going on?

23:56.530 --> 23:58.748
(high-pitched alarm chirping,
alarm wailing)

24:04.200 --> 24:07.101
Move! Get the extinguisher!

24:09.080 --> 24:11.002
Who's responsible for this?

24:21.960 --> 24:23.257
These are mannequins, sir.

24:23.260 --> 24:25.581
Repeat: Mannequins.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.455
Woman:
Fbi took the bait.

24:27.460 --> 24:28.654
They hit the decoy mansion.

24:28.660 --> 24:31.128
Koz is in the clear.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.397
Strip his hat and glasses!

24:36.400 --> 24:37.833
No, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

24:37.840 --> 24:39.535
It-it's my dad!

24:41.580 --> 24:44.333
Id confirmed, sir.
That's corban bennet.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.910
Hrt, is anyone
else at location?

24:46.910 --> 24:48.002
Negaﬁve.

24:52.650 --> 24:53.878
Who did this?!

24:56.420 --> 24:57.853
Francis:
Pick a kid at random.

24:57.860 --> 24:59.851
You!

24:59.860 --> 25:01.589
No, don't hit her!
It was me.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.897
Kyle!

25:06.870 --> 25:09.464
Okay, shut it down.

25:09.470 --> 25:12.837
Punishment will begin
at 6:00 a.M. Tomorrow.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.535
All right, everybody
back to your bunks!

25:14.540 --> 25:17.998
Punishment begins tomorrow
morning at 6:00 a.M.

25:18.010 --> 25:21.275
Move!

25:23.450 --> 25:24.644
Francis: .
It was an Interest/ng ,o/an.

25:24.650 --> 25:26.015
He didn't think it through.

25:26.020 --> 25:28.215
He should've started
three fires.

25:28.220 --> 25:29.687
Split us up.

25:29.690 --> 25:31.715
That would've worked.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.789
(computer dings)

25:33.790 --> 25:35.781
The map has finished decrypting.

25:40.170 --> 25:42.161
Francis:
There it is.

25:42.170 --> 25:43.831
Get me koz again.

25:43.840 --> 25:47.298
(line ringing)

25:51.240 --> 25:53.708
(cell phone ringing)

26:02.890 --> 26:05.814
Francis:
Koz, I have your destination.

26:05.830 --> 26:09.288
Go find out
what jonas has been hiding.

26:11.770 --> 26:13.761
(grunts)

26:20.510 --> 26:22.068
Dunn.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.377
Olsen:
We got played.

26:23.380 --> 26:25.405
The man we followed
into the man5ion

26:25.410 --> 26:27.776
Was one of the hostage's father,
corban bennet,

26:27.780 --> 26:29.771
Dressed in
the kidnapper's clothes.

26:29.780 --> 26:31.270
It was a parent mission.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.917
They got changed here
at the gas station.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.182
We were right.

26:35.890 --> 26:38.211
Recognize that?

26:38.230 --> 26:40.289
Car got fixed
in a hurry.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.221
Sir, we got him.

26:45.230 --> 26:47.221
(tires screeching)

26:47.230 --> 26:49.869
(engine starts)

26:49.870 --> 26:51.758
Do not lose him.

26:58.550 --> 27:01.041
(cell phone rings)

27:03.750 --> 27:06.981
Trace came back
from those texts.

27:06.990 --> 27:08.287
Number belongs
to a joel shearing.

27:08.290 --> 27:09.552
Who is he?

27:09.560 --> 27:11.050
He's not the kidnapper.

27:11.060 --> 27:12.618
You sure?

27:14.390 --> 27:16.858
He's amber's biological father.

27:20.070 --> 27:21.594
(cell phone rings)

27:21.600 --> 27:23.488
What is your heading?

27:23.500 --> 27:25.764
(static crackling)

27:25.770 --> 27:27.135
Sir?

27:27.140 --> 27:28.402
Sir!

27:28.410 --> 27:30.833
Dunn?

27:33.610 --> 27:35.771
He's jamming us.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.247
If its coming from his car,
we drop back

27:37.250 --> 27:38.672
And get a call out
we lose him.

27:38.690 --> 27:40.749
Or we stay close and
go in with no backup.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.853
We do not lose him.

27:42.860 --> 27:45.511
No, we do not lose him.

27:56.440 --> 27:57.589
No, it's simple.

27:57.610 --> 27:59.134
When I want to see you,

27:59.140 --> 28:01.631
I'll post a review
on the message board.

28:01.640 --> 28:04.507
The same when you
want to see me.

28:20.530 --> 28:22.623
You can't show me that.

28:22.630 --> 28:25.326
People died, meg, because
of something I made.

28:25.330 --> 28:27.389
Jonas, stop talking
or I'll be subpoenaed.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.322
Something you paid for.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.797
Jonas.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.070
You understand what has
to happen now, right?

28:37.140 --> 28:38.471
(scoffs)

28:45.890 --> 28:47.084
Who are they?

28:47.090 --> 28:49.854
My fbi escorts.

28:49.860 --> 28:52.317
Because of the
kidnapping.

28:54.930 --> 28:57.353
I don't hear from you
for a year and a half,

28:57.360 --> 28:59.191
And three days ago,

28:59.200 --> 29:02.089
I start getting messages.

29:02.100 --> 29:03.738
I'm glad you responded.

29:03.740 --> 29:05.264
(quiet laugh)

29:05.270 --> 29:06.828
I think we both know my response

29:06.840 --> 29:08.398
To you is a conditioned reflex.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.404
You look like I remember.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.773
Even in this tragedy.

29:15.780 --> 29:17.418
How do I look, meg?

29:17.420 --> 29:20.412
I imagine I have
the face I deserve.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.211
You...

29:24.230 --> 29:26.653
Threw me away.

29:28.230 --> 29:30.221
I'd outlived my usefulness,

29:30.230 --> 29:32.551
And you threw me away.

29:32.570 --> 29:34.595
I would've left
my wife for you.

29:35.770 --> 29:38.364
I would've left it all for you.

29:40.610 --> 29:42.601
Let me go, jonas.

29:42.610 --> 29:45.534
(groans)

29:49.250 --> 29:51.377
You taste like I remember.

29:54.990 --> 29:58.016
I always liked this house.

30:00.090 --> 30:03.150
What inspired you
to start looking for me, meg?

30:03.160 --> 30:06.766
I saw a photograph of you
at the pakistani embassy.

30:06.770 --> 30:08.499
In an fbi file

30:08.500 --> 30:09.762
On the kidnapping.

30:09.770 --> 30:11.988
We can repair it.

30:12.010 --> 30:13.966
The damage we've done.

30:13.970 --> 30:15.506
I know what to do.

30:15.510 --> 30:17.330
We work together and we...
Jonas.

30:17.340 --> 30:19.808
I risked my life coming here!

30:21.410 --> 30:22.911
Let me tell you what happened,

30:22.920 --> 30:24.672
And we can repair the damage.

30:24.690 --> 30:27.181
I know what
happened, jonas.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.582
I know.

30:30.590 --> 30:32.319
How could you know?

30:32.330 --> 30:34.355
Who told you?

30:35.500 --> 30:37.354
It was widener.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.769
Don't give me to him.

30:43.770 --> 30:45.192
Please.

30:46.370 --> 30:47.530
Meg!

30:47.540 --> 30:49.337
You got to listen to me.

30:49.340 --> 30:51.706
Something big is happening.

30:51.710 --> 30:55.202
There isn't anything bigger
than my daughter, jonas.

30:56.820 --> 30:58.708
Sorry.

31:02.790 --> 31:05.452
I'm sorry.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.521
You're not her fbi escorts,
are you?

31:14.170 --> 31:16.024
(handcuffs jingling)

31:17.400 --> 31:19.868
Widener:
My men have clarenbach.

31:19.870 --> 31:22.031
I held up my end
of the deal.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.577
Now, you tell me who
the kidnapper is.

31:24.580 --> 31:26.741
Francis gibson.

31:26.750 --> 31:28.399
The man who took those children,

31:28.420 --> 31:30.308
Francis gibson.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.845
Gibson?

31:32.850 --> 31:35.318
He's a ballard parent.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.754
He doesn't seem capable.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.819
What does he want?

31:49.170 --> 31:50.933
Woma n :
What is that?

31:50.940 --> 31:53.101
It's what jonas was too afraid
to keep at his house.

31:55.710 --> 31:57.871
I'm running searches
on the people in those photos.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.438
They're all...
They're all dead?

31:59.450 --> 32:01.702
Yeah. How'd you know?

32:01.720 --> 32:04.075
Francis:
I’m guess/ng none
by natural causes.

32:04.080 --> 32:06.878
Accidents,
suspicious circumstances,

32:06.890 --> 32:09.188
Unsolved homicides.

32:09.190 --> 32:11.351
Boss, who are those people?

32:25.940 --> 32:29.330
(high-pitched whistling nearby)

32:34.210 --> 32:36.917
Koz: _
Hey, secret serwce!

32:36.920 --> 32:39.946
Remember me?!

32:39.950 --> 32:42.111
You remember my brother?!

32:42.120 --> 32:43.485
His brother?

32:43.490 --> 32:45.754
I guess I must
have killed him.

32:45.760 --> 32:49.127
Too bad about what happened
to your brother.

32:49.130 --> 32:51.451
If only someone taught
him how to fight,

32:51.470 --> 32:53.222
Maybe he'd still be here!

33:07.610 --> 33:10.477
Finley...
We need him alive.

33:22.830 --> 33:24.320
(door opens)

33:24.330 --> 33:25.752
(door closes)

33:31.000 --> 33:33.560
(loud bang)

33:51.520 --> 33:53.920
(grunts)

34:13.080 --> 34:14.547
(grunts)

34:26.060 --> 34:28.620
(joints crack, finley gasps)

34:32.930 --> 34:34.898
Tell me how he fought.

34:34.900 --> 34:38.666
Come on! Come on!
Let me hear it!

34:38.670 --> 34:41.662
How did my brother fight,
secret service?

34:41.680 --> 34:43.170
Huh?!

34:43.180 --> 34:44.909
Did he hit like this?

34:46.850 --> 34:49.273
Hit like that?!

34:51.880 --> 34:52.778
(gasps)

34:54.090 --> 34:55.819
(groans)

34:59.460 --> 35:01.519
Where are the kids?!

35:01.530 --> 35:03.794
You tell me or I drop you down!

35:03.800 --> 35:05.597
You're gonna
stop right there.

35:05.600 --> 35:08.398
Why would I do that?

35:08.400 --> 35:11.130
Well...

35:11.140 --> 35:12.937
There's a kid

35:12.940 --> 35:15.204
In the trunk
of a car

35:15.210 --> 35:18.600
And he's just waiting for you
to rescue him.

35:19.780 --> 35:22.544
So I get around the building,

35:22.550 --> 35:25.212
And I'll text you where he is.

35:29.220 --> 35:30.118
(gasps)

35:32.730 --> 35:35.619
I got the death penalty coming,

35:35.630 --> 35:36.949
So aim higher!

35:41.830 --> 35:45.664
I hit that pavement down there,
you get no kids.

35:46.840 --> 35:50.378
I make it to the fire escape,
you get one.

35:51.840 --> 35:53.705
Your choice.

35:54.750 --> 35:56.479
But I'm not coming back
onto the roof.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.619
How do I_know
you're not messmg With me?

35:58.620 --> 36:01.316
That's not What we do.

36:06.130 --> 36:07.529
(metallic clattering,
koz grunts)

36:11.630 --> 36:13.860
(pounding on door)
dunn:
Finley!

36:13.870 --> 36:15.826
Finley!

36:17.100 --> 36:19.159
Where is he?

36:19.170 --> 36:20.603
Where'd he go, finley?

36:20.610 --> 36:23.101
I lost him.

36:23.110 --> 36:24.600
(phone rings)

36:31.020 --> 36:32.840
But it was worth it.

36:32.850 --> 36:35.080
We lost her.

36:43.030 --> 36:45.749
Swat leader:
Target vehicle spotted.
We are approaching the vehicle.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.732
We've matched the ticket
to the vehicle.

36:51.670 --> 36:53.638
Headquarters, we have a hostage.

36:54.670 --> 36:57.434
It's a ballard kid.

37:18.730 --> 37:22.166
Kidnapper put a lot
on the line to find this place.

37:23.740 --> 37:25.196
Someone's been
working in here.

37:25.210 --> 37:26.359
Who are these people?

37:26.370 --> 37:29.669
Judge... Died last year.
Drowned in his pool.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.170
Miami, florida.

37:31.180 --> 37:33.171
Reporter, died six months ago,
home invasion.

37:33.180 --> 37:35.774
No arrests.
Seattle, washington.

37:35.780 --> 37:36.917
Francis:
Bank In vest/gator.

37:36.920 --> 37:39.047
Car wreck,
washington, d.C.

37:39.050 --> 37:41.439
Foreign intelligence officer,
fell from window. Broken neck.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.109
New york city.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.451
Congressman, hotel fire,
new orleans.

37:44.460 --> 37:47.349
Dunn, this one.
I know this one.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.885
Human rights activist,

37:49.900 --> 37:51.891
Gunned down in his home,
but it wasn't just him.

37:51.900 --> 37:53.629
Francis:
He was shot with his fam/ly.

37:53.630 --> 37:57.293
Men, women, children.

37:57.300 --> 37:59.063
This is the one that started it.

37:59.070 --> 38:00.901
This is when Widener realized
what happens

38:00.910 --> 38:02.707
When those soldiers
take that drug,

38:02.710 --> 38:05.201
What they will do.

38:05.210 --> 38:07.474
This was the blood
he put on me.

38:09.150 --> 38:12.369
These are the people who were
killed in that massacre video.

38:12.390 --> 38:14.449
Dunn, What did that
soldier tell us?

38:14.450 --> 38:17.783
We killed women and children.

38:17.790 --> 38:20.884
Finley, these people,
these deaths,

38:20.890 --> 38:22.778
These are assassinations.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.227
Why would the kidnapper

38:25.230 --> 38:27.892
Risk getting caught
to come and see this?

38:27.900 --> 38:29.561
I wanted to create that program,

38:29.570 --> 38:32.733
And use those soldiers
to defend this country.

38:32.740 --> 38:35.766
It was extreme, but extreme
measures were needed out there.

38:35.780 --> 38:37.179
For those soldiers

38:37.180 --> 38:39.478
To use their bodies,
their senses,

38:39.480 --> 38:43.268
Their wills to defend
this country out there.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.941
Widener is using them here.

38:44.950 --> 38:48.181
My program, my soldiers,

38:48.190 --> 38:49.782
And it wasn't just once.

38:49.790 --> 38:51.109
It's still happening.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.554
He's using them
as his own personal hit squad.

38:54.990 --> 38:57.424
What that soldier said before
they took him.

38:57.430 --> 38:59.489
He doesn't want to sleep
because he dreams

38:59.500 --> 39:01.365
Of the people
he's gonna kill next.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.359
The ones right here.

39:05.370 --> 39:07.235
It's not finished.

39:12.610 --> 39:14.771
What's up, kyle?

39:14.780 --> 39:16.179
Still kidnapped.

39:16.180 --> 39:17.841
You here to make sure I'm okay?

39:17.850 --> 39:20.114
No, I'm not.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.179
I'm here to talk about
what you did today.

39:22.190 --> 39:25.216
Yeah? What about it?

39:25.230 --> 39:27.858
Well...

39:27.860 --> 39:29.885
It was stupid.

39:29.900 --> 39:33.392
It would have worked if I had
trusted the right person.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.163
No.

39:35.170 --> 39:37.035
It wouldn't have worked.

39:38.470 --> 39:39.835
I'm gonna ask you a question.

39:39.840 --> 39:41.467
You need to think
before answering.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.971
Do you want to outsmart
these guys?

39:43.980 --> 39:45.629
You want to get out of here?

39:46.850 --> 39:47.942
Yes.

39:49.150 --> 39:52.540
You need a better plan, lqle.

39:52.550 --> 39:55.519
That's something I have
experience in,

39:55.520 --> 39:58.512
Something we can work on
together, if you're serious.

40:02.260 --> 40:04.091
Claren bach :
No, its simple.

40:04.100 --> 40:06.864
When I want to see you,
I post a review

40:06.870 --> 40:08.269
On the message board.

40:08.270 --> 40:11.194
The same when you
want to see me.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.259
I want
to see you now.

40:13.270 --> 40:14.760
(chuckles)

40:14.780 --> 40:16.930
I guess I should
turn over, eh?

40:16.940 --> 40:22.947
you build a life on trust

40:22.950 --> 40:26.545
though, it starts

40:26.550 --> 40:30.281
with love and loss

40:30.290 --> 40:34.454
and When your heart

40:34.460 --> 40:37.918
begins to rust

40:37.930 --> 40:43.129
oh, it's just...

40:43.140 --> 40:47.930
You ever going to tell me
what amber's father wants?

40:47.940 --> 40:51.034
Well, if he's the same
as he was 17 years ago,

40:51.040 --> 40:53.941
He wants to drop off misery
and pick up money.

41:00.450 --> 41:02.714
Finley, What if we don't get
the kids back?

41:02.720 --> 41:05.052
We won't stop looking.

41:05.060 --> 41:08.052
This guy is better than us.

41:08.060 --> 41:09.459
He's smarter than us.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.826
If he wants to send a kid home
in a bag,

41:11.830 --> 41:13.388
There's nothing
we can do about it.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.891
Cross that bridge
if we come to it.

41:15.900 --> 41:18.789
You don't want to be anywhere
near me if that happens.

41:20.840 --> 41:22.239
What's he doing, finley?

41:22.240 --> 41:24.435
This guy with these kids?

41:24.440 --> 41:26.078
The cia,

41:26.080 --> 41:28.401
The soldiers,
those murders...

41:29.620 --> 41:32.077
What is he doing?

41:35.420 --> 41:36.978
Come on.

41:39.020 --> 41:40.851
Where?

41:40.860 --> 41:42.919
Let's ask him.

41:53.710 --> 41:55.337
There's a hit squad
out there.

41:55.340 --> 41:57.001
We saw evidence
of that today.

41:57.010 --> 42:00.002
So did you. They're killing
innocent americans.

42:00.010 --> 42:02.501
Is this Why you
took those kids?

42:02.520 --> 42:04.010
(phone clatters)

42:09.220 --> 42:12.451
(phone ringing)

42:12.460 --> 42:16.123
