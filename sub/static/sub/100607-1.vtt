<i>I don't know.</i>

01:21.023 --> 01:23.023
- Eine <i>happy family!</i>
- <i>Just keep smiling.</i>

01:23.025 --> 01:24.992
- Smile.
- You just pulled off my ski!

01:24.994 --> 01:26.593
Honey,
don't put your thing on his ski.

01:26.595 --> 01:27.727
You're gonna get...

01:27.729 --> 01:30.396
- You're stepping on my ski!
- The underside?

01:30.398 --> 01:32.398
- <i>Like that?</i>
- <i>Closer together?</i>

01:32.400 --> 01:34.335
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- <i>Guys, smile.</i>

01:35.838 --> 01:37.770
Put your arms up.
Like this. Like that?

01:37.772 --> 01:39.039
Hey!

01:39.041 --> 01:40.107
Oh, my God!

01:40.109 --> 01:41.175
Finn!

01:41.177 --> 01:42.675
- You're on my ski, okay? Stop!
- Guys.

01:42.677 --> 01:44.477
Guys. Just separate the boys.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.578
And then I should...

01:45.580 --> 01:46.814
Guys, you're separated.

01:46.816 --> 01:48.985
Stop!

01:50.518 --> 01:51.751
Can you
say that again?

01:51.753 --> 01:53.053
<i>He wants me to get
on the underside.</i>

01:53.055 --> 01:54.121
<i>Are you serious?</i>

01:54.123 --> 01:55.755
<i>No, no, no.
Pete, stay where you are.</i>

01:55.757 --> 01:57.825
Don't shoot this part.
Wait till we're ready.

01:57.827 --> 01:59.793
Please stand up
straight.

01:59.795 --> 02:01.561
- Please look into the camera.
- I'm trying.

02:01.563 --> 02:03.463
Please just smile.

02:03.465 --> 02:05.332
<i>Come on, guys,
say "Austria!"</i>

02:05.334 --> 02:06.967
<i>Austria!</i>

02:08.170 --> 02:09.435
He wants poles up again.

02:09.437 --> 02:10.838
He wants us to keep
doing poles up.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.041
I don't know.

02:50.279 --> 02:51.711
A little crowded, huh?

02:51.713 --> 02:52.813
Yeah, it's lively.

02:52.815 --> 02:54.081
Yeah, I think it's
just that time of day.

02:54.083 --> 02:55.084
I think so, too.

02:56.252 --> 02:57.517
Oh.

02:57.519 --> 02:59.855
Sorry. Sorry.

03:04.526 --> 03:05.725
Honey,
have you noticed

03:05.727 --> 03:07.428
there are no kids around here?

03:07.430 --> 03:10.097
I mean, it seems kinda weird,
don't you think?

03:10.099 --> 03:12.665
Maybe it's just
different school schedules.

03:12.667 --> 03:13.869
Yeah, maybe.

03:14.536 --> 03:15.869
This way, this way.

03:15.871 --> 03:19.639
Hey, guys, stay where
I can see you, please.

03:19.641 --> 03:21.911
Hi. Thank you.
It's Stanton.

03:24.413 --> 03:25.879
Who are you texting?

03:25.881 --> 03:27.214
Uh, Zach.

03:27.216 --> 03:28.949
Zach-from-work Zach?

03:28.951 --> 03:29.984
Yeah.

03:29.986 --> 03:32.485
Oh. Why is he texting you?
Are you friends now?

03:32.487 --> 03:34.021
No. I just told him
about our trip,

03:34.023 --> 03:36.457
and it turns out that he
and his girlfriend, Rosie,

03:36.459 --> 03:38.425
they're traveling
through Europe as well.

03:38.427 --> 03:39.525
Oh, no kidding?

03:39.527 --> 03:41.028
Amsterdam, it seems,
at the moment.

03:41.030 --> 03:42.495
"Hashtag no agenda."

03:42.497 --> 03:43.663
Oh, come on.

03:43.665 --> 03:45.165
"Hashtag live your best life."

03:45.167 --> 03:46.934
Hashtag get better hashtags.

03:46.936 --> 03:48.768
Yeah. Right,
yeah, no, I know.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.503
- Hashtag don't do hashtags.
- Right.

03:50.505 --> 03:51.604
Hashtag stop
wasting your time.

03:51.606 --> 03:52.672
Right?

03:52.674 --> 03:53.807
With hashtags.

03:53.809 --> 03:55.309
Honey, can you get off
your phone now?

03:55.311 --> 03:56.509
- I'm all done. I'm all done.
- Good.

03:56.511 --> 03:58.680
- Okay.
- Let's just be here, okay?

03:59.581 --> 04:02.182
I see.

04:02.184 --> 04:03.283
Hello?

04:03.285 --> 04:04.418
Hello?

04:04.420 --> 04:07.154
Hello, I'm Charlotte.

04:07.156 --> 04:08.721
So, your flight was okay?

04:08.723 --> 04:09.923
Yeah, it was good.

04:09.925 --> 04:11.624
- At what time did you get in?
- Oh...

04:11.626 --> 04:13.626
Um, I think about
midday, I would...

04:13.628 --> 04:14.727
Yeah, I wanted to get
out on the mountain,

04:14.729 --> 04:15.996
ski before we checked in.

04:15.998 --> 04:17.697
Well, I'm sorry I was
not there to meet you.

04:17.699 --> 04:20.000
Now, what have
I got for you?

04:20.002 --> 04:21.268
You are...

04:21.270 --> 04:22.602
- The Stantons.
- Stanton.

04:22.604 --> 04:24.206
Yeah, I know.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.808
- Resort map.
- Oh, thank you.

04:27.810 --> 04:30.277
- Key cards.
- Great.

04:30.279 --> 04:31.478
Oh, actually,
I'm curious.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.081
Are there other kids
around here?

04:34.083 --> 04:35.115
No, not here.

04:35.117 --> 04:38.185
The town of Fiss,
maybe minutes of 20 from here.

04:38.187 --> 04:39.853
There is all families.

04:39.855 --> 04:42.356
But here is better.
It's lively.

04:42.358 --> 04:43.924
The Ibiza of the Alps.

04:43.926 --> 04:45.959
And you will want
to party all night.

04:45.961 --> 04:48.796
Now, in Europe,
we think it is unhygienic

04:48.798 --> 04:50.630
to sauna in the swimsuit,

04:50.632 --> 04:51.932
so everyone naked.

04:51.934 --> 04:55.402
Here the body
is not to be ashamed of.

04:55.404 --> 04:56.669
Well, speak
for yourself.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.941
No, your body is good.
Celebrate it.

04:59.508 --> 05:00.941
Okay. Yes.

05:00.943 --> 05:03.377
- I will for sure do that.
- Both.

05:03.379 --> 05:04.845
Yeah. No, no.
No question.

05:04.847 --> 05:06.180
- Good.
- We'll celebrate it.

05:06.182 --> 05:07.815
So I am here
as friend, <i>ja?</i>

05:07.817 --> 05:09.783
Do you want
to be my friend?

05:09.785 --> 05:11.684
- Oh. Oh, sure.
- Um...

05:11.686 --> 05:13.287
Then we are friends.

05:13.289 --> 05:15.189
- Oh. Great. Wonderful.
- Oh.

05:15.191 --> 05:16.724
Okay.

05:17.326 --> 05:19.128
Oh. Oh, sorry.

05:25.034 --> 05:26.100
Thank you.

05:26.102 --> 05:28.168
Thank you so much.

05:28.170 --> 05:32.738
Hey, guys, hang up your ski
stuff to dry, please.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.674
Boys, cool it.

05:34.676 --> 05:37.377
Put all that stuff
in drawers, okay?

05:37.379 --> 05:38.545
It hurts!

05:38.547 --> 05:39.847
Tell you something.

05:39.849 --> 05:43.083
Them sharing a queen
is gonna be a disaster.

05:43.085 --> 05:45.020
Honey.

05:45.788 --> 05:48.222
No. Now I'm done.

05:48.224 --> 05:49.356
Zach kept texting.

05:49.358 --> 05:51.091
Asking about Ischgl and
where we're staying, so...

05:51.093 --> 05:53.060
All right, but we're not
looking for them

05:53.062 --> 05:55.496
to no-agenda their way
here, are we, Pete?

05:55.498 --> 05:56.762
No. No, no, no.

05:56.764 --> 05:58.565
That's why I wanted
to finish that conversation.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.102
Yeah. Good.

06:00.936 --> 06:01.935
Look.

06:01.937 --> 06:05.038
I found my dad's old hat.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.040
I thought I'd bring it
and wear it on the slopes.

06:07.042 --> 06:08.175
No way.

06:08.177 --> 06:09.343
Have him here with us.

06:09.345 --> 06:11.247
That's so sweet.

06:12.348 --> 06:13.849
I love that.

06:16.252 --> 06:17.419
Yeah.

06:19.622 --> 06:22.890
Sorry if I've been,
you know...

06:22.892 --> 06:25.961
Oh. That's why
we're here. Right?

06:26.362 --> 06:27.528
Yeah.

06:27.530 --> 06:29.231
It's good for all of us.

06:41.544 --> 06:42.744
Okay.

06:43.913 --> 06:46.380
- We should stop, right?
- Yeah.

06:46.382 --> 06:47.783
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:48.284 --> 06:49.285
Done.

07:00.029 --> 07:01.395
Okay.

07:01.397 --> 07:04.331
Okay. Seriously.

07:04.333 --> 07:07.100
'Cause we're gonna want a
big breakfast in the morning.

07:07.102 --> 07:08.103
Yes.

07:10.339 --> 07:12.339
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:12.341 --> 07:13.739
I'm gonna
grab a shower.

07:13.741 --> 07:15.177
All right.

07:26.689 --> 07:27.990
Okay.

07:35.631 --> 07:36.830
Knock, knock.

07:36.832 --> 07:37.898
What?

07:37.900 --> 07:39.266
What?
What do you mean, what?

07:39.268 --> 07:40.334
What?

07:40.336 --> 07:41.902
Taking my clothes off.

07:41.904 --> 07:43.503
She said we're supposed
to celebrate our bodies.

07:43.505 --> 07:47.574
I knew you were gonna
pick up on that.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.413
Yeah. So we don't
lose each other.

08:26.415 --> 08:27.447
Good thinking, right?

08:27.449 --> 08:30.284
There wasn't much left
in the arts and crafts stuff

08:30.286 --> 08:32.386
except for these
back-to-school stickers,

08:32.388 --> 08:35.289
which the boys are not
gonna be too excited about.

08:35.291 --> 08:36.525
No. Yeah.

08:37.660 --> 08:39.493
They won't be too psyched.

08:39.495 --> 08:42.965
Honey, you're gonna wear that
under a helmet, right?

08:43.465 --> 08:44.765
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

08:44.767 --> 08:46.568
- Yeah. Yeah.
- For under. Mmm-hmm.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.874
Hey, boys,
we're leaving in five.

08:53.876 --> 08:55.709
Get your stuff together.

08:55.711 --> 08:56.843
Okay.

09:20.436 --> 09:22.271
Slow up, Finn!

09:22.838 --> 09:25.407
Hey, hey, hey! Stop!

09:28.043 --> 09:29.176
Whoa.
You gotta wait up

09:29.178 --> 09:30.812
for the rest of the
group, okay, bud?

09:30.814 --> 09:31.912
Okay.

09:40.889 --> 09:42.522
Oh, God.

09:42.524 --> 09:43.957
He's just
playing it up.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.258
Honey, honestly,

09:45.260 --> 09:46.760
it's just a phase.
You've gotta let it go.

09:46.762 --> 09:47.994
No, I know.

09:47.996 --> 09:49.129
'Cause, I mean,
the more you make of it...

09:49.131 --> 09:50.230
The more
we give attention to it...

09:50.232 --> 09:51.098
Right.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.199
It's gonna become
more of a thing.

09:52.201 --> 09:53.300
It becomes
a thing and, yeah.

09:53.302 --> 09:54.903
- Yeah. Yeah, got it.
- Exactly.

09:59.575 --> 10:01.276
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.249
Way to go, Em.
You're like a rocket.

10:11.720 --> 10:12.787
All right,
lookit, guys,

10:12.789 --> 10:14.187
this is what I'm thinking.

10:14.189 --> 10:17.057
I'm thinking we should just
have some soup right now

10:17.059 --> 10:20.427
and then we can have some of
those yummy pastries at 4:00.

10:20.429 --> 10:22.229
And then we'll still
be hungry for dinner.

10:22.231 --> 10:24.097
Doesn't that sound like a good
plan, you guys?

10:24.099 --> 10:26.666
Maybe we ski the Beast
after lunch.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.468
- I'll do that, Dad.
- Yeah.

10:28.470 --> 10:29.871
Oh. Um...

10:29.873 --> 10:31.204
I don't think it'll
be that challenging.

10:31.206 --> 10:32.739
It looks black
but it skis red.

10:32.741 --> 10:33.808
Really?

10:33.810 --> 10:35.008
American blue.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.310
Yeah. Several of
the black runs

10:37.312 --> 10:39.112
are American blue.
European red.

10:39.114 --> 10:40.981
They just call 'em black
for the prestige.

10:40.983 --> 10:42.482
Where did you hear that?

10:42.484 --> 10:43.417
I just know it. Yeah.

10:43.419 --> 10:45.018
It'll be fine.
You can handle it.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.153
How about this?
Why don't we go

10:46.155 --> 10:47.521
and we find
some good powder?

10:47.523 --> 10:49.489
And then we can get
in some practice runs,

10:49.491 --> 10:51.024
you know, for the, uh...

10:53.897 --> 10:55.662
Rodeo?

10:55.664 --> 10:58.200
No, Pete. For the...

11:03.405 --> 11:04.406
Wow.

11:19.755 --> 11:21.655
It's a controlled avalanche.

11:21.657 --> 11:22.722
Yeah.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.090
Is that okay, Pete?

11:24.092 --> 11:25.461
Yeah. It's fine.

11:29.866 --> 11:30.932
Mom?

11:35.504 --> 11:36.570
Mom!

12:23.887 --> 12:25.587
Pete?

12:35.597 --> 12:37.332
You good? You okay?

12:40.803 --> 12:42.170
Wow, huh?

12:46.208 --> 12:49.812
That was...
I mean, right?

12:50.947 --> 12:52.379
Nuts.

12:52.381 --> 12:53.382
Yeah.

12:56.285 --> 12:58.754
Those people are laughing.

12:59.321 --> 13:00.587
Everyone okay?

13:00.589 --> 13:01.623
Oh, hey.

13:03.392 --> 13:06.560
- Here we go. Uh...
- We'll clean all this off.

13:06.562 --> 13:07.995
What can I get for you?

13:07.997 --> 13:09.698
I'm gonna go with soup.

13:10.465 --> 13:11.731
Yeah.

13:11.733 --> 13:14.703
- Get the pastries later?
- Uh...

13:15.838 --> 13:16.839
Sure.

13:17.874 --> 13:19.809
But soup. Soup for now.

13:20.342 --> 13:21.343
Yeah.

13:22.377 --> 13:24.513
- Thank you.
- Phew.

14:06.655 --> 14:08.055
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

14:08.057 --> 14:09.456
Stop! Stop!

14:09.458 --> 14:10.457
Stop!

14:10.459 --> 14:12.525
Please.
Watch what you're doing.

14:17.532 --> 14:18.698
It's cool, yeah?

14:18.700 --> 14:20.835
No, it's not cool.
You could've crushed my son.

14:20.837 --> 14:21.902
You all right?

14:21.904 --> 14:22.905
Yeah.

14:27.076 --> 14:29.043
- Please.
- What is going on here?

14:29.045 --> 14:31.012
They stop not hard.

14:31.014 --> 14:32.145
What happened here?

14:32.147 --> 14:33.647
Let's just walk away
from this.

14:33.649 --> 14:34.915
Let's just walk away.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.451
Everything cool.

14:39.154 --> 14:40.589
You want help
with your shoes?

14:40.957 --> 14:42.555
No.

14:42.557 --> 14:44.125
What was all of that?
I don't get it.

14:44.127 --> 14:45.225
No, he wasn't looking

14:45.227 --> 14:47.427
and he slid the thing
back on him.

14:47.429 --> 14:48.762
Are you all right?

14:48.764 --> 14:50.298
Yeah, I'm good.

14:50.766 --> 14:52.234
He's fine.

14:53.002 --> 14:54.636
It just startled me.

15:14.891 --> 15:16.491
You look pretty.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.393
Thank you.

15:32.741 --> 15:33.943
Um...

15:34.877 --> 15:36.143
You think
you could...

15:36.145 --> 15:37.310
I'm just...

15:37.312 --> 15:38.378
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:38.380 --> 15:39.581
- Okay.
- Yeah.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.597
- Oh, it's crowded.
- Wow.

16:30.233 --> 16:32.099
So are you gonna say
something about...

16:32.101 --> 16:33.299
- Yay!
- Oh!

16:33.301 --> 16:35.069
My good friends!

16:35.071 --> 16:37.104
Oh, I think she wants us
to, uh...

16:37.106 --> 16:38.774
No, no, no.
She's just waving. Hi.

16:40.009 --> 16:41.407
No, now she's
kinda beckoning.

16:41.409 --> 16:42.475
- Okay.
- In a way.

16:42.477 --> 16:43.811
We'll make an excuse.

16:43.813 --> 16:45.179
There's no reason I take.

16:45.181 --> 16:46.247
Okay.

16:46.249 --> 16:48.082
Yeah. I think
it'd be rude now.

16:48.084 --> 16:49.415
- We're with her.
- Oh. Okay.

16:49.417 --> 16:51.252
- The woman in the white.
- No, we're not.

16:51.254 --> 16:52.485
Ah. Yes.

16:52.487 --> 16:53.788
Your white wine
and scotch.

16:53.790 --> 16:55.355
- Thank you very much.
- Perfect.

16:55.357 --> 16:57.624
And bring another round
for me and my friends, yes.

16:57.626 --> 16:58.725
Oh, no, I'm good for now. Yeah.

16:58.727 --> 16:59.927
Oh, no.
I think one is fine.

16:59.929 --> 17:01.929
- Thank you.
- No. It's smart to get now.

17:01.931 --> 17:05.032
The bar gets crazy.
The Ibiza of the Alps, yes?

17:05.034 --> 17:06.133
Oh, right.

17:06.135 --> 17:08.002
- I drink if you not.
- Okay.

17:08.004 --> 17:09.337
Going to clubs.

17:09.771 --> 17:11.038
Ah, ah, ah.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.173
Nice.

17:12.175 --> 17:14.307
So a night off, huh?

17:14.309 --> 17:15.876
So you find
you get enough time off.

17:15.878 --> 17:19.048
Oh, sure. Enough to catch
a dick whenever I like.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.448
That's great.

17:22.450 --> 17:24.419
Time is nice to have.

17:25.320 --> 17:26.821
Oh. We have guests.

17:26.823 --> 17:27.955
- Charlie.
- Hello.

17:27.957 --> 17:29.455
Hi.

17:29.457 --> 17:30.858
- Hello. Hi.
- Hello.

17:30.860 --> 17:32.725
- These are my friends, Billie.
- I'm Billie, yes.

17:32.727 --> 17:34.061
- My wife, Billie. Hi.
- And Pete.

17:34.063 --> 17:36.063
I was just talking
about you.

17:36.065 --> 17:37.264
All good, I hope.

17:37.266 --> 17:38.331
- Sure.
- Yeah.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.602
Well,
what has she been saying?

17:44.339 --> 17:46.040
It was pretty brief.
I mean...

17:46.042 --> 17:47.340
Yeah, she's a fan
of yours.

17:47.342 --> 17:48.474
Yeah, positive.

17:48.476 --> 17:49.676
- Positive stuff.
- Yeah.

17:49.678 --> 17:51.814
I said I can catch a dick
whenever I like.

17:52.647 --> 17:54.447
Is that...

17:54.449 --> 17:57.051
That's right.
That is what she said. Yeah.

17:57.053 --> 17:58.553
Right. Uh...

17:59.521 --> 18:02.455
Okay, no, I just
thought, you know...

18:02.457 --> 18:03.623
I thought...

18:03.625 --> 18:05.094
I was kidding.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.330
Why? You think
we're getting married?

18:09.332 --> 18:11.098
No! God, no!

18:11.100 --> 18:12.333
Okay.

18:12.335 --> 18:13.334
I didn't think
we're getting married.

18:13.336 --> 18:14.400
I just thought,

18:14.402 --> 18:17.271
we had a really
nice day today...

18:17.273 --> 18:19.106
I wanna go.

18:19.108 --> 18:21.077
I just, you know...

18:21.409 --> 18:22.711
Uh-huh.

18:23.846 --> 18:25.380
So you two
know each other from...?

18:26.048 --> 18:28.048
Oh, well, I'm...
Well, here.

18:28.050 --> 18:29.950
Yeah. Yeah,
I came in on Sunday

18:29.952 --> 18:31.886
and she showed me around.

18:31.888 --> 18:34.520
Yeah, but you are
a quick learner.

18:35.825 --> 18:37.657
Quick.

18:37.659 --> 18:39.692
And you have a good day
on the mountain?

18:39.694 --> 18:42.729
Ugh. We had a great day.
Great conditions.

18:42.731 --> 18:44.932
Just a real alpine experience.

18:44.934 --> 18:46.633
- Yeah.
- Well,

18:46.635 --> 18:49.136
we almost all died
in an avalanche.

18:49.138 --> 18:50.304
What?

18:50.306 --> 18:51.537
- But, yeah, it was great.
- Billie.

18:51.539 --> 18:52.739
It was fantastic.

18:52.741 --> 18:56.145
Billie, hold on.
I mean, there was a moment.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.578
It was an avalanche.

18:58.580 --> 19:00.647
- Good lord.
- Good fuck!

19:00.649 --> 19:02.482
- No, I mean, there was...
- Yeah.

19:02.484 --> 19:05.487
For a moment,
it could've felt dicey.

19:06.322 --> 19:08.789
Hang on a second.

19:08.791 --> 19:12.993
For quite a moment,
it felt incredibly dicey.

19:12.995 --> 19:14.962
- Seriously.
- Okay.

19:14.964 --> 19:18.564
And then it was over,
and it was fine.

19:18.566 --> 19:19.766
We were all fine.

19:19.768 --> 19:21.368
The kids were
really scared.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.037
Of course.

19:23.039 --> 19:24.671
No question.

19:24.673 --> 19:26.539
I mean, Pete,
what they saw was...

19:26.541 --> 19:29.276
Scary for them.
Absolutely.

19:29.278 --> 19:30.610
Yes.

19:30.612 --> 19:33.347
But we're here and they're
upstairs watching a movie.

19:33.349 --> 19:34.815
Just hanging out.

19:34.817 --> 19:37.017
And I guess,

19:37.019 --> 19:40.586
emotionally, we've just been
through a lot lately.

19:40.588 --> 19:43.456
My dad passed away
eight months ago.

19:43.458 --> 19:44.590
Yeah.

19:44.592 --> 19:46.293
- It happens.
- That's a shame.

19:46.295 --> 19:48.062
It's been a lot.

19:48.064 --> 19:49.865
So, uh, we came here.

19:50.665 --> 19:52.902
And that's why we're here.

19:53.601 --> 19:55.204
So let's just be here.

19:57.273 --> 19:58.571
- Okay.
- Here's to here.

19:58.573 --> 19:59.974
- Here's to here.
- Here's to here.

19:59.976 --> 20:04.111
My father was
a travel agent for 30 years.

20:04.113 --> 20:05.980
He never really went anywhere.

20:05.982 --> 20:08.949
His knowledge of the world
was based solely on research.

20:08.951 --> 20:12.119
When he retired, alongside
a good buddy of his,

20:12.121 --> 20:16.489
they received this exquisite
set of cut glassware.

20:16.491 --> 20:17.590
He had a special shelf
for them

20:17.592 --> 20:18.658
and he put them up there,

20:18.660 --> 20:19.793
and even when
we came to visit,

20:19.795 --> 20:20.894
he wouldn't bring them down.

20:20.896 --> 20:23.097
I don't know
what he was saving them for.

20:23.099 --> 20:25.299
Maybe nothing.

20:25.301 --> 20:27.935
But, went back home
for the funeral,

20:27.937 --> 20:29.269
I met with Hughie.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.603
That's the friend
of his dad's.

20:30.605 --> 20:31.972
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

20:31.974 --> 20:35.508
So we had a toast to Dad with
the same set of glasses,

20:35.510 --> 20:37.411
you know, over at Hughie's.

20:37.413 --> 20:40.080
And after, he just threw them
right into the dishwasher.

20:40.082 --> 20:43.618
And I asked him, "Do you use
those for every day?"

20:44.719 --> 20:46.188
And do you know
what he said to me?

20:47.456 --> 20:50.723
"Every day
is all we have."

20:50.725 --> 20:51.726
Yep.

20:53.829 --> 20:56.830
Powerful. Powerful stuff.

20:56.832 --> 20:59.433
So, I mean, to me, you know,

20:59.435 --> 21:03.671
today was today.

21:04.306 --> 21:05.638
Here's to today.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.974
Today!

21:06.976 --> 21:08.375
Yeah. Yeah.

21:08.377 --> 21:10.110
Even so, I think that

21:10.112 --> 21:12.146
you should report
to resort safety.

21:12.148 --> 21:13.113
Oh.

21:13.115 --> 21:15.082
Yes.
If only to give you ease.

21:15.084 --> 21:16.582
That's an excellent idea.

21:16.584 --> 21:18.718
Yes, that's what I wanna do.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.553
- Yeah.
- Right?

21:20.555 --> 21:22.158
- Great. Great idea.
- Yeah.

22:20.983 --> 22:22.449
<i>Ja?</i>

22:22.451 --> 22:24.485
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Guys.

22:24.487 --> 22:27.689
So we wish
to make a complaint.

22:28.924 --> 22:29.925
Yes?

22:33.095 --> 22:36.997
Uh, that there was an
avalanche that we, um...

22:36.999 --> 22:40.666
That caused
alarm yesterday.

22:40.668 --> 22:43.070
The controlled avalanche
from Zwolferkopf, yes.

22:43.072 --> 22:45.339
Well, you say
it was controlled,

22:45.341 --> 22:46.840
but I think
you need to know

22:46.842 --> 22:51.113
that people
really freaked out.

22:52.381 --> 22:53.983
But everyone was safe, yeah?

22:55.184 --> 22:58.318
Well, we don't
know that, in fact.

22:58.320 --> 22:59.955
I can tell you.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.055
Everyone was safe.

23:02.057 --> 23:02.990
Oh.

23:02.992 --> 23:05.826
Well, that's great.
That is such good news.

23:05.828 --> 23:08.295
'Cause that helps.
That helps to hear that.

23:08.297 --> 23:10.166
Yeah, I gotta
say just...

23:11.600 --> 23:13.534
I don't understand
why there weren't

23:13.536 --> 23:15.536
any warnings
posted anywhere.

23:15.538 --> 23:17.703
- There was a warning.
- What? Where?

23:17.705 --> 23:19.239
Posted at lifts, gondolas,

23:19.241 --> 23:22.009
hotel receptions,
restaurants, shops,

23:22.011 --> 23:25.579
bars, soda machines, toilets.

23:25.581 --> 23:27.314
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

23:27.316 --> 23:28.549
We didn't
see any of that.

23:28.551 --> 23:29.751
Well...

23:31.487 --> 23:33.822
- Um...
- Is that not correct?

23:34.156 --> 23:35.688
Maybe...

23:35.690 --> 23:37.858
Gosh. I might have
seen something

23:37.860 --> 23:39.526
that mentioned
snow conditions.

23:39.528 --> 23:41.828
Yes. They were everywhere.

23:41.830 --> 23:43.297
So you saw it?

23:43.299 --> 23:45.265
There were a lot of...

23:45.267 --> 23:46.400
I saw one sign.

23:46.402 --> 23:47.601
There was...

23:47.603 --> 23:50.103
Hold on.

23:50.105 --> 23:51.271
No, the point
I'm trying to make...

23:51.273 --> 23:52.839
- What is your point?
- Here's the point.

23:52.841 --> 23:53.974
What's your point?

23:53.976 --> 23:56.243
Warning or no warning,
mmm-hmm,

23:56.245 --> 23:57.678
seen it or not,

23:57.680 --> 23:59.712
we would just like
some acknowledgment

23:59.714 --> 24:02.284
that it was handled poorly.

24:06.956 --> 24:09.291
It was handled perfectly.

24:12.828 --> 24:15.562
No, it was not.

24:15.564 --> 24:16.863
- Yes.
- No!

24:16.865 --> 24:18.599
You cannot tell me

24:18.601 --> 24:20.567
that that was the way
it was supposed to go.

24:20.569 --> 24:22.636
- Yes, exactly like that.
- No!

24:22.638 --> 24:26.141
Snow went all over the plates.

24:27.843 --> 24:30.379
Snow went
all over the plates.

24:32.281 --> 24:35.382
Here's what I think
you're not picking up on.

24:35.384 --> 24:39.820
This was a huge event
for our family, okay?

24:39.822 --> 24:42.522
And, sir,
I don't wanna make this

24:42.524 --> 24:44.024
a legal matter between us.

24:44.026 --> 24:45.292
- I don't.
- Mmm. Billie.

24:45.294 --> 24:46.660
- No, I don't wanna...
- I know, but...

24:46.662 --> 24:47.794
What I'm saying
is what I don't want.

24:47.796 --> 24:49.730
We're not in America
where you sue

24:49.732 --> 24:51.398
because your coffee
is hot, madam.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.166
Screw you. I'm an attorney.

24:53.168 --> 24:55.269
Okay.
You've heard our complaint.

24:55.271 --> 24:57.738
Yeah, well,
someone needs to hear it.

24:57.740 --> 24:59.139
Thank you for your time.

24:59.141 --> 25:01.908
And "no thank you for your time" from me.

25:01.910 --> 25:03.812
That is for certain.

25:06.749 --> 25:08.382
- I've got it, okay?
- Okay.

25:15.291 --> 25:16.792
What a jackass, huh?

25:17.192 --> 25:18.492
Yeah.

25:18.494 --> 25:19.926
Who's a jackass?

25:19.928 --> 25:22.362
Oh, the man who's
supposedly in charge.

25:22.364 --> 25:23.499
That's who.

25:25.934 --> 25:27.936
Yeah, big jackass.

25:51.160 --> 25:52.559
Uh...

25:52.561 --> 25:54.061
Do you, um, have...

25:54.063 --> 25:55.064
Yeah.

26:18.687 --> 26:21.355
- <i>Like that?</i>
- <i>You want to get it like that.</i>

26:21.357 --> 26:22.522
<i>There you go.</i>

26:22.524 --> 26:24.958
<i>How much do you love
traveling with me?</i>

26:24.960 --> 26:27.262
<i>This much.</i>

26:51.653 --> 26:52.654
Mom.

26:54.156 --> 26:55.157
Mom.

27:00.596 --> 27:01.630
What?

27:03.399 --> 27:04.664
Oh, my God.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.967
- Pete?
- Mmm.

27:06.969 --> 27:08.969
What? Oh, okay.

27:08.971 --> 27:10.737
- Oh, my God.
- Should I wake up Em?

27:10.739 --> 27:12.139
Yes. Yes.

27:12.141 --> 27:14.809
And let's not watch people sleep.
I don't like that.

27:14.811 --> 27:16.011
We gotta go.

27:18.046 --> 27:19.913
Where are we going?

27:19.915 --> 27:21.148
Are we going to a
different mountain?

27:21.150 --> 27:22.616
No, better. It's gonna be great.

27:22.618 --> 27:23.885
Yeah, it's a
Daddy surprise.

27:23.887 --> 27:25.152
Um, I think I should go in

27:25.154 --> 27:26.686
and get something
from the buffet.

27:26.688 --> 27:27.988
We are late though.

27:27.990 --> 27:29.189
I'm starving.

27:29.191 --> 27:30.991
No, I'm gonna get
a little fruit, okay?

27:30.993 --> 27:32.259
No, you know,
we'll be fine.

27:32.261 --> 27:33.393
Dad! Dad!
Car! Car! Car!

27:33.395 --> 27:35.564
Can you pop
the trunk, please?

27:46.375 --> 27:47.507
We're here. Sorry.

27:47.509 --> 27:48.708
The Stantons?

27:48.710 --> 27:49.877
- Yep. That's us.
- Hi.

27:49.879 --> 27:51.144
They were just
about to go.

27:51.146 --> 27:52.479
Oh, I'm so sorry.
We overslept.

27:52.481 --> 27:53.947
Come on, guys.
Let's go. Let's go.

27:53.949 --> 27:56.516
Hey, we're heli-skiing, guys.
How cool is that, huh?

27:56.518 --> 27:57.584
Awesome!

27:57.586 --> 27:59.953
Yeah. A little Daddy treat.
Daddy thought of it.

27:59.955 --> 28:01.354
I'm so hungry.

28:01.356 --> 28:02.756
Once we get up
on the powder, bud,

28:02.758 --> 28:04.057
you'll forget all about that.

28:04.059 --> 28:06.726
Yeah, maybe they have
a protein bar or something.

28:06.728 --> 28:07.895
Do you have a bar?

28:07.897 --> 28:10.363
Ah, yes.
Yes, there is a seat belt.

28:10.365 --> 28:11.264
What?

28:11.266 --> 28:14.034
We really should
climb on now. Please.

28:14.036 --> 28:15.769
Oh, is there gonna be
a briefing?

28:15.771 --> 28:17.604
Yes, yes!
We can do that on the way!

28:17.606 --> 28:18.672
Please, come!

28:18.674 --> 28:19.739
Where's my glove?

28:19.741 --> 28:21.141
You mean we're just gonna go?

28:21.143 --> 28:22.242
Isn't there
any more information

28:22.244 --> 28:23.610
that we need to have?

28:23.612 --> 28:24.544
As in?

28:24.546 --> 28:26.613
We'll get all that
when we get on board!

28:26.615 --> 28:27.782
- Mom!
- What?

28:27.784 --> 28:28.916
I can't find my glove!

28:28.918 --> 28:30.550
Why are you
so stupid?

28:30.552 --> 28:31.819
Hey! Hey!

28:31.821 --> 28:33.420
No. Come here a second.

28:33.422 --> 28:34.856
Come here.

28:34.858 --> 28:37.057
Guys, what don't we do?

28:37.059 --> 28:38.558
Call people names.

28:38.560 --> 28:41.096
And so what do you say
now, Finn?

28:41.763 --> 28:42.830
I'm sorry.

28:42.832 --> 28:44.030
Good job, Finn.

28:44.032 --> 28:46.633
Hang on, Pete.
No, not good job.

28:46.635 --> 28:50.303
Look him in the eye right now
and say it loud and clear,

28:50.305 --> 28:53.242
so he can hear you
and understand you.

28:54.042 --> 28:55.475
I'm sorry!

28:55.477 --> 28:57.077
- We should go!
- There we go!

28:57.079 --> 28:58.745
Please! Please!

28:58.747 --> 29:00.547
We really should depart!

29:00.549 --> 29:02.415
The weather may change!

29:02.417 --> 29:04.150
Okay. It's just that
he's missing a glove.

29:04.152 --> 29:06.119
Wait a minute. What?
Change to what?

29:06.121 --> 29:07.220
Let's go!

29:07.222 --> 29:09.055
Every day is all we have!

29:09.057 --> 29:12.025
I understand that, Pete,
but he doesn't have a glove.

29:12.027 --> 29:13.426
We're missing a glove here,

29:13.428 --> 29:15.195
and she just said something
about the weather changing.

29:15.197 --> 29:17.063
They're gonna have
a spare glove! Yeah!

29:17.065 --> 29:18.265
You have a spare?

29:18.267 --> 29:20.100
I don't know!
Come! Please!

29:20.102 --> 29:21.836
They've gotta have
spare gloves!

29:21.838 --> 29:23.737
She just said
she doesn't know!

29:23.739 --> 29:24.872
Well, he can borrow yours!

29:24.874 --> 29:26.740
What? Then I'll
get cold, Peter!

29:26.742 --> 29:27.808
Okay, okay!

29:27.810 --> 29:28.876
He can borrow mine!

29:28.878 --> 29:31.979
It'll fly off!
It doesn't fit him!

29:31.981 --> 29:33.816
Do you have
spare gloves?

29:35.150 --> 29:37.617
Do you
have spare gloves?

29:37.619 --> 29:39.619
Protein bars?

29:39.621 --> 29:42.289
Billie, I spent two grand
on this, okay?

29:42.291 --> 29:44.792
- I'm well aware of that, Pete!
- Okay, let's go!

29:44.794 --> 29:46.660
Let's have a great time, okay?

29:46.662 --> 29:47.795
Come on!

29:47.797 --> 29:49.729
What? No!

29:49.731 --> 29:51.164
Pete, stop!

29:51.166 --> 29:54.069
Don't walk away
from us!

29:54.636 --> 29:57.038
We are missing gloves!

29:57.040 --> 29:58.672
The children
are starving!

29:58.674 --> 30:03.145
And there's something
about the weather changing!

30:07.683 --> 30:09.583
Get in the car!

30:12.154 --> 30:13.854
Do you want help, Mom?

30:13.856 --> 30:15.022
No, thank you!

30:15.024 --> 30:16.189
Are you sure?

30:16.191 --> 30:17.459
It's fine!

30:18.126 --> 30:19.894
Get in the car!

30:19.896 --> 30:21.630
In the car!

30:41.450 --> 30:43.619
Here's your glove, sweetie.

30:52.728 --> 30:53.830
Okay.

30:56.531 --> 30:59.766
All right. Well,
we still have the rest of the afternoon.

30:59.768 --> 31:01.670
What's everyone up for?

31:02.071 --> 31:03.503
Beach?

31:05.440 --> 31:07.240
If we gobble all this up,
we'll still have an hour,

31:07.242 --> 31:09.043
hour and a half
up on the mountain.

31:09.045 --> 31:11.879
I think we're gonna cut
our losses for today.

31:11.881 --> 31:13.346
Just hunker down
this afternoon.

31:13.348 --> 31:16.817
We could sit around the
fire and make popcorn.

31:16.819 --> 31:19.319
And then maybe later,
you boys can watch a movie,

31:19.321 --> 31:23.325
and you and I
can have some time.

31:25.727 --> 31:26.961
I love that idea.

31:26.963 --> 31:28.062
Me too.

31:28.064 --> 31:30.230
- Yeah. I think that's smart.
- Yeah.

31:30.232 --> 31:31.498
Fruit.

31:31.500 --> 31:34.802
Guys, put fruit
in yourselves, please.

31:34.804 --> 31:37.771
I could do something but
I feel really bad for Mom.

31:37.773 --> 31:39.106
All right,
I'm sorry.

31:39.108 --> 31:41.476
Oh, don't you love me?

32:04.867 --> 32:07.367
You're telling me
that they just showed up?

32:07.369 --> 32:09.502
No. They were nearby
and actually called.

32:09.504 --> 32:10.905
They just happened
to call?

32:10.907 --> 32:12.505
Billie, yes, they called.

32:12.507 --> 32:14.708
When? When did
they call actually?

32:14.710 --> 32:15.575
- When?
- Yeah. When?

32:15.577 --> 32:17.577
When I was
in the bathroom.

32:17.579 --> 32:18.511
You know Zach.

32:18.513 --> 32:20.213
No. No. Actually I don't.

32:20.215 --> 32:22.215
I don't know Zach, Pete.
Not well.

32:22.217 --> 32:24.451
Not like the way you know
your work buddy. Right?

32:24.453 --> 32:26.686
And I certainly don't
know the woman.

32:26.688 --> 32:29.522
I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't know how to play the phone call.

32:29.524 --> 32:30.559
Shh!

32:32.095 --> 32:33.560
- Can we help?
- Hey.

32:33.562 --> 32:35.528
- Oh, no. Stay seated.
- No. We're good.

32:35.530 --> 32:37.898
Yeah, you guys
just relax.

32:37.900 --> 32:41.367
I hope they like carrot
sticks and Goldfish.

32:41.369 --> 32:42.569
I'm sorry,
I should've...

32:42.571 --> 32:44.637
Yeah, well,
but now you can't.

32:44.639 --> 32:47.141
- Oh. Okay. Hey.
- Hey.

32:47.143 --> 32:48.608
Ugh, that looks so good.

32:48.610 --> 32:50.077
It does?

32:50.079 --> 32:51.212
All right.

32:51.214 --> 32:53.214
So, you guys,
let's hear about this trip.

32:54.316 --> 32:57.285
Well, I mean,
from what we remember,

32:58.187 --> 32:59.452
it's been epic.

32:59.454 --> 33:01.688
From what I've seen, yeah.

33:01.690 --> 33:02.890
It's been intense.

33:02.892 --> 33:06.794
We've hit, what, like,
three countries in four days.

33:06.796 --> 33:10.865
Just Tuesday, we were having
morning strudel in Dusseldorf

33:10.867 --> 33:11.899
and by that afternoon,

33:11.901 --> 33:13.968
we were hiking along
the Rhine River in France.

33:13.970 --> 33:15.468
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

33:15.470 --> 33:17.972
And, um,
there might have been some shrooms

33:17.974 --> 33:22.742
on one or all of those days.

33:22.744 --> 33:24.477
Does that sound weird
when I say it?

33:24.479 --> 33:26.247
No.
I loved the way you said it.

33:26.249 --> 33:27.447
"Shrooms"?
Do I sound like a narc?

33:27.449 --> 33:28.883
- Shroomies.
- Shrooms.

33:28.885 --> 33:31.085
- Shrooms. Just shrooms.
- Shrooms. We did shrooms.

33:31.087 --> 33:32.186
So you did shrooms?

33:32.188 --> 33:33.921
- Yes. We did shrooms.
- Yeah, we did.

33:33.923 --> 33:35.122
Okay, got it.

33:35.124 --> 33:36.489
I don't know, I think
the whole point of this trip

33:36.491 --> 33:38.424
was me just stepping
out of my comfort zone

33:38.426 --> 33:40.227
and following Rosie's lead,

33:40.229 --> 33:41.929
and so that's what
I've been doing,

33:41.931 --> 33:44.364
and I've just been
relinquishing all of this...

33:44.366 --> 33:45.665
Not relinquishing.
Expanding.

33:45.667 --> 33:46.599
Expanding.

33:46.601 --> 33:47.935
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sorry.

33:47.937 --> 33:48.903
Um, I've been expanding.

33:48.905 --> 33:51.071
His world.
It's a positive thing.

33:51.073 --> 33:52.139
- Okay.
- Yeah.

33:52.141 --> 33:53.207
Yeah.

33:53.209 --> 33:54.741
Like, you know
how blind people,

33:54.743 --> 33:56.944
all their other senses
get more intense?

33:56.946 --> 33:58.012
- Right.
- Yeah.

33:58.014 --> 33:59.146
Being with Rosie is like that.

33:59.148 --> 34:00.346
But I didn't even
have to go blind.

34:00.348 --> 34:01.414
Babe.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.050
- Seriously.
- Oh.

34:03.052 --> 34:05.186
I call her
Rosie the Riveting.

34:05.188 --> 34:06.719
He does.

34:06.721 --> 34:09.223
And it's so good for me,
'cause you know me, Pete.

34:09.225 --> 34:10.356
Yeah, I do.

34:10.358 --> 34:12.392
I mean, normally
I'm all about hotels and...

34:12.394 --> 34:13.726
- Right?
- Yeah.

34:13.728 --> 34:15.296
Room service,
crisp sheets.

34:15.298 --> 34:16.429
Right, right, right.

34:16.431 --> 34:17.697
You know,
at breakfast I'm thinking,

34:17.699 --> 34:18.866
"Okay, well,
where are we gonna have dinner?"

34:18.868 --> 34:20.633
And then, before I go to
bed, I'm thinking,

34:20.635 --> 34:22.837
"Well, tomorrow we should get
breakfast at that same place

34:22.839 --> 34:24.637
"because they have that
one thing that I like."

34:24.639 --> 34:26.372
We're experimenting
with new.

34:26.374 --> 34:27.574
Thank you.

34:27.576 --> 34:30.211
It's a really good
place for him to live.

34:30.213 --> 34:31.278
You have to live there.

34:31.280 --> 34:33.080
Hey, I know
I'm not leaving.

34:34.683 --> 34:36.784
Yeah, we just found
in each other this desire

34:36.786 --> 34:38.384
to share our lives
in a certain way.

34:38.386 --> 34:41.721
So it's about travel, adventure.

34:41.723 --> 34:43.489
We don't see
ourselves having kids,

34:43.491 --> 34:47.760
so it's about us
living for us.

34:47.762 --> 34:49.395
Hashtag no agenda.

34:49.397 --> 34:51.397
- I mean, we love that.
- Aw.

34:51.399 --> 34:53.466
That's all Rosie.
She nails the hashtags.

34:53.468 --> 34:55.803
- Thanks.
- Oh, you're the one.

34:55.805 --> 34:56.736
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:56.738 --> 34:57.805
And, I mean,
no agenda's

34:57.807 --> 34:59.006
what got us here
tonight, right?

34:59.008 --> 35:01.374
I mean, we didn't know
what tonight was gonna be,

35:01.376 --> 35:03.743
and then you texted
and here we are.

35:03.745 --> 35:07.380
Yeah, we don't even
have return tickets.

35:07.382 --> 35:10.650
Like, who knows what's next?

35:10.652 --> 35:12.518
Well, you kinda know
what's next, don't you?

35:12.520 --> 35:14.321
'Cause you have work
on Monday.

35:14.323 --> 35:16.090
Correct?

35:16.092 --> 35:17.057
Oh. Yeah, no,
I mean, for sure.

35:17.059 --> 35:18.325
Oh, no, yeah.
We'll get tickets home.

35:18.327 --> 35:20.327
I have to show
a commercial space

35:20.329 --> 35:21.931
- in Cambridge at 8:30, so...
- Mmm-hmm.

35:24.100 --> 35:26.100
Yeah.

35:26.102 --> 35:27.334
So what about you guys?

35:27.336 --> 35:29.036
You guys getting
in good ski days?

35:29.038 --> 35:30.337
Yeah. Yeah, good. Yeah.

35:30.339 --> 35:31.874
Cool.

35:34.609 --> 35:36.810
Um, I mean,
we did have a moment

35:36.812 --> 35:39.714
that was
a little unnerving.

35:40.883 --> 35:42.649
But we got over it

35:42.651 --> 35:44.385
and we've been having
a great time.

35:44.387 --> 35:46.387
God.

35:46.389 --> 35:48.088
Oh.

35:48.090 --> 35:49.455
Okay,
what happened?

35:49.457 --> 35:51.457
It was just an event
that we got through.

35:51.459 --> 35:52.692
- Yeah. That's it.
- That was all.

35:52.694 --> 35:54.128
It's good
to come through events.

35:54.130 --> 35:55.095
Exactly.

35:55.097 --> 35:56.964
No, we're good now.
Yeah, it was nothing.

35:56.966 --> 35:57.965
It wasn't nothing.

35:57.967 --> 35:59.699
No. Okay. Yeah. Okay.
That's the wrong word.

35:59.701 --> 36:01.434
At all.
I mean, it was something.

36:01.436 --> 36:02.669
Yeah.

36:02.671 --> 36:07.740
We were sitting
outside at a restaurant,

36:07.742 --> 36:11.312
and there was this huge bang.

36:11.314 --> 36:14.281
And suddenly,
this wall of snow

36:14.283 --> 36:16.417
comes rumbling down
the mountain,

36:16.419 --> 36:19.519
and it did not look
like it was gonna stop.

36:19.521 --> 36:21.454
It looked like
it was gonna kill us.

36:21.456 --> 36:22.722
For a moment.

36:22.724 --> 36:24.825
No! No! Absolutely not.

36:24.827 --> 36:28.362
Because other people
felt exactly the same way.

36:28.364 --> 36:30.364
They were getting up.
They were screaming.

36:30.366 --> 36:32.232
I screamed.

36:32.234 --> 36:34.734
And the kids were screaming.

36:34.736 --> 36:37.271
Because it felt
like this was it.

36:37.273 --> 36:39.008
That we were gonna die.

36:39.942 --> 36:41.110
Um...

36:43.179 --> 36:45.913
And I look over at Pete,

36:45.915 --> 36:49.517
and he had jumped up
and grabbed his phone.

36:52.021 --> 36:53.956
He was gone.

36:55.124 --> 36:57.126
Pete ran. Pete left us.

36:58.493 --> 37:00.863
I guess in his mind, um,

37:02.630 --> 37:05.134
he left us there
to get buried,

37:07.702 --> 37:11.637
because, um,
he could make it away,

37:11.639 --> 37:12.940
and we were too far away.

37:12.942 --> 37:15.142
You know, we were on
the other side of the, uh...

37:15.144 --> 37:16.243
I don't know.

37:16.245 --> 37:21.050
Anyway, so I throw my arms
around my children,

37:22.218 --> 37:26.552
and just wait, you know?

37:26.554 --> 37:29.691
I just wait for us
to die together.

37:30.192 --> 37:32.061
Sorry.

37:35.831 --> 37:40.036
Anyway, so then, um,
moments pass,

37:42.670 --> 37:44.805
and oh, my God,
I'm still there.

37:44.807 --> 37:47.877
And the kids stop screaming.

37:51.514 --> 37:54.549
And we're okay, we realize.
We're okay.

37:58.586 --> 38:00.790
And then Pete comes back,

38:02.590 --> 38:05.061
and just orders soup.

38:08.030 --> 38:09.165
So...

38:12.101 --> 38:13.333
That's intense.

38:13.335 --> 38:14.336
Yeah.

38:25.381 --> 38:27.083
But, you know,
I think...

38:28.350 --> 38:31.653
You know,
I think in a situation like that...

38:32.888 --> 38:35.089
I think it's probably
a survival reaction

38:35.091 --> 38:36.656
that kicks in.

38:36.658 --> 38:37.925
Right, Pete?

38:37.927 --> 38:41.161
You don't even have time
to think. It's a reflex.

38:41.163 --> 38:44.431
It's like when a sea cucumber
perceives a threat,

38:44.433 --> 38:47.468
it rapidly evacuates all of
its organs through its rectum.

38:47.470 --> 38:49.905
How could I have
possibly run away?

38:50.539 --> 38:52.506
- What?
- In ski boots?

38:52.508 --> 38:54.475
How is that possible?

38:54.477 --> 38:56.011
Can you run in ski boots?

38:56.412 --> 38:57.845
Wait, what?

38:57.847 --> 38:59.513
Zach, can you run
in ski boots?

38:59.515 --> 39:01.248
- It's not recommended.
- Oh, fine.

39:01.250 --> 39:02.449
Clomp away.

39:02.451 --> 39:04.084
Walk briskly away. I mean...

39:04.086 --> 39:05.052
No. You said "run."

39:05.054 --> 39:07.254
Rosie, can you
run in ski boots?

39:07.256 --> 39:08.754
Not very well, but...

39:08.756 --> 39:10.190
Boom. Exactly.

39:10.192 --> 39:13.227
Regardless, I wouldn't
leave my family to die.

39:13.229 --> 39:15.596
That's "boom, exactly."

39:15.598 --> 39:17.297
No, no, nor would I.
And I didn't.

39:17.299 --> 39:18.565
It's just she said you did.

39:18.567 --> 39:19.765
Yeah, because he did.

39:19.767 --> 39:21.835
For fuck's sakes, Billie.
Why are you...

39:21.837 --> 39:24.538
And I didn't leave you
to be buried.

39:24.540 --> 39:26.607
- I don't know.
- Well, I do.

39:26.609 --> 39:28.641
I was there
and I saw it differently.

39:28.643 --> 39:31.578
So then tell me, Pete.
What happened differently?

39:31.580 --> 39:33.347
Please.

39:33.349 --> 39:34.848
- The snow was coming.
- Right.

39:34.850 --> 39:36.483
Almost like an avalanche.

39:36.485 --> 39:38.886
Oh, now it's not even
an avalanche.

39:38.888 --> 39:41.654
I checked
on you guys visually,

39:41.656 --> 39:43.656
and when I made sure
that everyone was okay,

39:43.658 --> 39:44.994
I ran to get help.

39:46.195 --> 39:48.728
Hang on a second.
That doesn't even make sense!

39:48.730 --> 39:52.299
You knew that we were okay,
so you went to get help?

39:52.301 --> 39:53.300
What?

39:53.302 --> 39:55.668
It happened very fast.
It was very confusing.

39:55.670 --> 39:56.970
Right. Survival reaction.

39:56.972 --> 39:59.373
But I checked to
make sure you guys were okay

39:59.375 --> 40:01.310
and then I went to get help.

40:06.615 --> 40:09.082
That's not
what happened, Peter.

40:09.084 --> 40:10.884
Billie, I can accept
your version of the truth.

40:10.886 --> 40:12.619
Why can't you accept mine?

40:12.621 --> 40:15.721
Because mine is true
and not dumb.

40:15.723 --> 40:17.991
- You weren't there with me!
- Right!

40:17.993 --> 40:21.696
That's exactly right.
I was at the table with our children.

40:22.798 --> 40:26.166
I just love that
you're making me say

40:26.168 --> 40:28.703
that what happened for
you happened for me.

40:30.639 --> 40:31.840
Okay.

40:38.948 --> 40:41.181
I mean, Pete,
like a lot of times,

40:41.183 --> 40:43.749
the people involved
in automobile accidents

40:43.751 --> 40:45.452
get the events of the
accident completely wrong.

40:45.454 --> 40:48.055
- Stop pitching theories, Zach.
- Yeah, sorry.

40:48.057 --> 40:49.022
Fuck.

40:49.024 --> 40:52.859
Just come on
out here for a sec. Um...

40:52.861 --> 40:55.395
Sorry. We just
have one question.

40:55.397 --> 40:56.863
Billie, no.

40:56.865 --> 40:58.031
- Yeah, yeah.
- No.

40:58.033 --> 41:01.767
You can say...
I was talking with our friends

41:01.769 --> 41:04.638
about, uh, when we were
having lunch, remember?

41:04.640 --> 41:07.274
And then the avalanche
was coming,

41:07.276 --> 41:11.113
and, um, can you say
what happened next?

41:14.717 --> 41:16.416
They can say.

41:16.418 --> 41:19.920
It's for the story and,
um, they wanted to know.

41:19.922 --> 41:21.423
They can say,
right, Pete?

41:22.224 --> 41:23.225
Sure.

41:26.195 --> 41:27.796
The truth.

41:30.165 --> 41:31.300
Um...

41:33.602 --> 41:35.137
Dad ran away.

41:35.804 --> 41:37.070
And Finn?

41:37.072 --> 41:38.941
Is that what you think
happened, too?

41:40.843 --> 41:42.542
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.

41:42.544 --> 41:44.511
Okay, guys. Thanks.

41:44.513 --> 41:46.548
You can go back
to your funny movie.

41:55.324 --> 41:57.893
They're such great kids.

41:59.895 --> 42:02.029
You might have traumatized
them, you know that?

42:02.031 --> 42:03.297
Oh, I traumatized them?

42:03.299 --> 42:04.898
You care so much about
being right, don't you?

42:04.900 --> 42:06.900
No, I just wanna get
this straight.

42:06.902 --> 42:08.368
No, you just
want to get it right.

42:08.370 --> 42:11.538
So, congratulations, Billie, you win.
You're right.

42:11.540 --> 42:14.977
Everyone give Billie a
fucking round of applause.

42:16.512 --> 42:18.278
Hey, Pete?

42:18.280 --> 42:19.913
You left your family!

42:19.915 --> 42:22.051
That I am right about!

43:22.378 --> 43:25.481
Hey. Uh,
I'm gonna take a solo day today.

43:25.948 --> 43:28.315
Oh. Okay.

43:28.317 --> 43:30.917
So you and the boys
can have an adventure.

43:30.919 --> 43:32.052
Yeah, fine.

43:32.054 --> 43:33.653
Maybe we'll cross paths
on the mountain.

43:33.655 --> 43:35.756
Actually, I saw a leaflet

43:35.758 --> 43:38.625
for one of those
Alpine rail slides.

43:38.627 --> 43:40.894
The boys might
really enjoy that.

43:40.896 --> 43:42.529
It's at the family resort,

43:42.531 --> 43:46.101
the one that's just minutes
of 20 from here.

43:49.505 --> 43:50.570
Great.

43:50.572 --> 43:52.174
- Sure.
- Great.

43:56.111 --> 43:57.413
Oh.

44:00.015 --> 44:01.683
Getting an eyeful?

44:02.684 --> 44:04.418
Oh.

44:04.420 --> 44:05.685
Hello.

44:05.687 --> 44:06.987
No, no, no. I was just...

44:06.989 --> 44:08.655
And where is your team?

44:08.657 --> 44:10.757
Oh, I'm taking
a solo day today.

44:10.759 --> 44:11.992
Good.

44:11.994 --> 44:13.593
Adventure.

44:13.595 --> 44:14.928
Just for you.

44:14.930 --> 44:16.129
Yeah. Adventure.

44:16.131 --> 44:18.365
Fun. Just for you.

44:18.367 --> 44:19.834
Yeah. Fun.

44:19.836 --> 44:21.170
You want fun?

44:22.504 --> 44:23.505
Yeah.

44:23.873 --> 44:24.938
Fun.

44:24.940 --> 44:26.141
Good.

44:26.575 --> 44:27.943
- Oh!
- Come.

44:29.711 --> 44:31.445
Oh, I think that
this is the line right here.

44:31.447 --> 44:33.915
No, no, this wait
is not for you.

44:33.917 --> 44:35.317
Oh.

44:36.185 --> 44:37.751
Sorry.

44:37.753 --> 44:39.854
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:39.856 --> 44:40.954
Okay. Oh, great.
Well, once again,

44:40.956 --> 44:42.055
thank you so much
for your help.

44:42.057 --> 44:43.523
Adventure, yes?

44:43.525 --> 44:45.258
Now? Fun?

44:45.260 --> 44:47.795
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All of it. Right.

44:53.168 --> 44:54.367
Oh, you're coming?

44:54.369 --> 44:56.002
- Yeah. I come with.
- Ah.

44:56.004 --> 44:58.371
Wonderful. Yeah.

44:58.373 --> 45:00.908
So, I am interested
on another question.

45:00.910 --> 45:02.075
Oh, good. Okay.

45:02.077 --> 45:05.414
Have you had varied life
of sexual experience?

45:05.882 --> 45:07.080
What? I'm sorry?

45:07.082 --> 45:08.615
Have you had a varied life
of sexual experience?

45:08.617 --> 45:11.117
No, no, no. I'm not asking you
so that you would repeat that.

45:11.119 --> 45:13.253
We're in a public space.
I'm just saying.

45:13.255 --> 45:16.490
At that age, they rarely
bother with the English.

45:16.492 --> 45:18.893
Boy, you really get
right in there, don't you?

45:18.895 --> 45:21.929
I'm sorry. I just don't like
so much bullshit all the time.

45:21.931 --> 45:23.330
Yeah, I get that.

45:23.332 --> 45:25.432
I'm not a fan of the
bullshit myself either.

45:25.434 --> 45:27.869
- You just seem to me like...
- Like what?

45:27.871 --> 45:29.804
You haven't been
all the blocks around.

45:29.806 --> 45:31.505
- Me?
- Yeah.

45:31.507 --> 45:32.439
Oh, no, no, no.

45:32.441 --> 45:34.140
You'd be surprised
actually.

45:34.142 --> 45:37.377
In college, I had,
um, so many boyfriends.

45:37.379 --> 45:39.246
I mean, I really knew
my way around.

45:39.248 --> 45:41.014
I mean, I did my
fair share of...

45:44.653 --> 45:46.353
I don't like
to perform that.

45:46.355 --> 45:48.088
Nobody likes it.

45:48.090 --> 45:50.892
I just tend to do
only what I like.

45:50.894 --> 45:52.127
- Mmm.
- I masturbate.

45:52.594 --> 45:53.895
Every day.

45:53.897 --> 45:55.729
Because that is for me.

45:55.731 --> 45:56.964
And having sex
with guests...

45:56.966 --> 45:58.966
Yes, that is very for me.

45:58.968 --> 46:01.002
But you're married.
Is that right?

46:01.004 --> 46:02.536
- Are you? Is that the case?
- Yeah. Yeah.

46:02.538 --> 46:04.638
Okay. So how does
that work with everything?

46:04.640 --> 46:06.139
With your Mr. Charlie

46:06.141 --> 46:08.976
and whatever other
fellow you happen...

46:08.978 --> 46:11.211
Easy. I spend
the winters here,

46:11.213 --> 46:13.547
and in the summer,
my husband and I have the farm.

46:13.549 --> 46:15.048
And your husband
is cool with that?

46:15.050 --> 46:16.416
No, my husband,
my husband.

46:16.418 --> 46:18.287
- What?
- Can we shake hands?

46:19.388 --> 46:21.989
Now, should I tell my husband
about this? Should you?

46:21.991 --> 46:23.156
What are you
talking about?

46:23.158 --> 46:24.959
Our bodies touched.
We have a little intimacy.

46:24.961 --> 46:26.126
Oh, please.

46:26.128 --> 46:28.428
Well, why?
Why is there this absurdity?

46:28.430 --> 46:31.197
When these two parts of our
bodies touch, no big deal.

46:31.199 --> 46:32.265
Because it's very...

46:32.267 --> 46:33.733
But the other parts, oh, no.

46:33.735 --> 46:34.601
No.

46:34.603 --> 46:37.070
The bodies touch,
the special parts.

46:37.072 --> 46:38.605
- Well, yes, they're special.
- Oh, my goodness.

46:38.607 --> 46:41.308
What shall we do? The god
is angry in the heaven,

46:41.310 --> 46:43.778
- so the marriage must be over.
- Well, no, not that.

46:43.780 --> 46:45.579
The special parts
have rubbed.

46:45.581 --> 46:46.713
It's superstition.

46:46.715 --> 46:48.081
It isn't, actually.

46:48.083 --> 46:50.116
I mean, for instance,

46:50.118 --> 46:52.152
shaking hands doesn't make
babies, does it?

46:52.154 --> 46:53.753
- Oh, please.
- Well.

46:53.755 --> 46:54.855
Sex doesn't need
to make babies.

46:54.857 --> 46:56.057
No, I know that.

46:56.059 --> 46:57.657
And you don't need sex
to make the babies, yeah?

46:57.659 --> 46:58.592
Of course not, but...

46:58.594 --> 47:02.195
So, can we all just
move on now, please?

47:02.197 --> 47:05.398
But what I mean is,
is that in a relationship,

47:05.400 --> 47:09.202
it seems to me you need to
be on the same page, right?

47:09.204 --> 47:11.738
I mean, it's like a story,

47:11.740 --> 47:15.241
and you both have to be
in the same story.

47:15.243 --> 47:18.211
Well, I guess
I make my own story.

47:18.213 --> 47:19.880
Of course, yeah. But...

47:19.882 --> 47:21.015
I'm happy.

47:21.017 --> 47:22.317
Are you happy?

47:23.019 --> 47:24.286
Yeah.

47:26.455 --> 47:27.520
Good.

47:27.522 --> 47:28.388
Yeah.

47:28.390 --> 47:30.858
Then you're happy
with your story,

47:30.860 --> 47:33.126
and I'm happy with mine.

47:33.128 --> 47:34.895
- Okay.
- Yes?

47:34.897 --> 47:36.264
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yes?

47:36.933 --> 47:38.298
Yes. I said, "Yes."

47:38.300 --> 47:40.233
I said, "Yes."
Yes, yes, yes.

47:40.235 --> 47:41.603
- Good.
- Yeah.

47:46.843 --> 47:48.477
I'm a little sore.

47:49.177 --> 47:50.945
Mr. Charlie is an animal.

47:50.947 --> 47:52.445
Good, we're here.

47:52.447 --> 47:54.182
I can't sit.

47:56.418 --> 47:59.887
And now, Guglielmo will be
your instructor.

47:59.889 --> 48:01.989
Wait. What?
Who will be my what?

48:01.991 --> 48:03.492
Bye-bye. Have fun.

48:06.662 --> 48:08.095
You ready?

48:08.097 --> 48:10.965
Uh... I don't know.

48:10.967 --> 48:12.434
This way.

48:13.235 --> 48:14.902
This place is awesome.

48:14.904 --> 48:16.571
Yeah. Why aren't
we staying here?

48:17.073 --> 48:18.839
Yeah. It's fine.

48:18.841 --> 48:20.141
I mean, it's different.

48:20.143 --> 48:22.442
I don't know if it's better.
Just different.

48:22.444 --> 48:24.246
Finn!
Here it is!

48:24.746 --> 48:25.747
Let's go.

48:33.956 --> 48:35.089
So.

48:35.091 --> 48:36.222
So. Yeah.

48:36.224 --> 48:39.126
The first thing
of instruction is?

48:39.128 --> 48:41.194
I honestly have no idea.
I don't...

48:41.196 --> 48:42.997
Coffee.

48:42.999 --> 48:44.397
Oh. Okay.

48:44.399 --> 48:46.067
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

48:46.069 --> 48:47.634
<i>Buongiorno</i> to you.

48:47.636 --> 48:50.570
So, listen, actually Charlotte
said your name very quickly.

48:50.572 --> 48:51.941
- I didn't quite...
- Guglielmo.

48:52.741 --> 48:53.808
It's very simple.

48:53.810 --> 48:56.678
"Gu" like Google, "gli" like
we, "elmo" like helmet.

48:57.479 --> 48:58.378
Um, I...

48:58.380 --> 48:59.847
You can call me G.

48:59.849 --> 49:00.915
- G.
- Yes.

49:00.917 --> 49:01.982
G.

49:01.984 --> 49:03.717
Just to be clear,
I didn't sign up

49:03.719 --> 49:05.385
- for an instructor today.
- Uh-huh.

49:05.387 --> 49:06.586
'Cause I was gonna just take

49:06.588 --> 49:08.155
- a solo day.
- Uh-huh.

49:08.157 --> 49:10.091
Um, 'cause I'm
a pretty decent skier.

49:10.093 --> 49:11.291
And why stop at decent?

49:11.293 --> 49:12.392
No, I mean...

49:12.394 --> 49:13.727
There is better
than decent, no?

49:13.729 --> 49:14.995
Yes, of course,
there's better than decent, yeah.

49:14.997 --> 49:16.663
Okay. So,
you see this coffee?

49:16.665 --> 49:17.731
I do.

49:17.733 --> 49:19.599
It's decent. Yeah.

49:19.601 --> 49:21.135
- Uh-huh.
- Boring. Okay?

49:21.137 --> 49:22.235
Oh, hold it?

49:22.237 --> 49:24.337
Yes. But...

49:24.339 --> 49:26.040
Yeah. A-ha!

49:26.042 --> 49:28.209
Alpine coffee.

49:28.211 --> 49:29.777
Better.

49:29.779 --> 49:32.679
Yeah, that's better
than decent, I suppose.

49:32.681 --> 49:33.747
Yeah.

49:33.749 --> 49:35.082
Okay. Wow.

49:35.084 --> 49:36.819
Way better than decent.

49:45.862 --> 49:46.996
Mmm.

49:49.165 --> 49:50.530
So, thank you for the
better than decent.

49:50.532 --> 49:52.066
You're welcome.

49:52.068 --> 49:54.300
I appreciate it.
I'm gonna take off.

49:54.302 --> 49:56.137
Okay. Wait,
wait, wait. Billie.

49:56.139 --> 49:57.637
I'm gonna
tell you what, okay?

49:57.639 --> 49:58.505
Yeah.

49:58.507 --> 50:02.810
So, we will ski
together a little bit,

50:02.812 --> 50:05.745
and then after that
if you want to be solo,

50:05.747 --> 50:06.914
you be solo.

50:06.916 --> 50:09.018
Okay.

50:09.551 --> 50:10.483
Good, G.

50:10.485 --> 50:11.954
Yes. Give me five.

50:13.089 --> 50:14.289
Yes.

51:01.971 --> 51:04.038
Finn, buddy,
ease up on your brakes!

51:04.040 --> 51:05.538
It's no fun if you go slow!

51:05.540 --> 51:06.874
You're too close!

51:06.876 --> 51:08.978
Buddy, come on!
Your brother's way ahead!

51:26.361 --> 51:27.795
I warned you.
Here I come!

51:27.797 --> 51:28.931
Dad, stop!

51:30.967 --> 51:33.000
I'm coming for ya!

51:33.002 --> 51:35.035
I'm gonna tap you, okay?

51:35.037 --> 51:37.104
- No. Don't!
- What?

51:37.106 --> 51:38.504
Don't!

51:38.506 --> 51:40.607
Gonna get you, Finn!
I'm gonna get you, bro!

51:40.609 --> 51:43.177
- Don't!
- Dad's on your tail, bro!

51:43.179 --> 51:44.379
Don't!

51:45.413 --> 51:48.148
We post rules.
You cannot bump.

51:48.150 --> 51:49.582
No, I'm sorry.

51:49.584 --> 51:51.854
I know, but I barely tapped him.

51:55.124 --> 51:57.358
Let's see, they have
a toboggan run.

51:57.360 --> 51:59.126
Arcade.

51:59.128 --> 52:01.262
Uh, indoor
miniature golf.

52:01.264 --> 52:02.562
Lot of good stuff.

52:02.564 --> 52:04.832
Any of that sound good?

52:04.834 --> 52:05.968
I don't care.

52:09.872 --> 52:11.471
What's up?

52:11.473 --> 52:13.843
Doesn't seem like
you wanna be here.

52:14.442 --> 52:16.145
Of course I do.

52:17.412 --> 52:20.082
I love spending time
with you more than anything.

52:20.850 --> 52:21.851
Right?

52:22.417 --> 52:23.750
Is it about the slide?

52:23.752 --> 52:26.020
Okay, so Daddy got
kicked off the slide, yes.

52:26.022 --> 52:28.523
Because Daddy was
having too much fun.

52:32.929 --> 52:34.128
Okay, you know what?

52:34.130 --> 52:36.196
Let's just try to end this day
on a high note, all right?

52:36.198 --> 52:39.699
And you guys go ahead
and pick something right here.

52:39.701 --> 52:42.637
Go ahead. We can do
multiple things if you want.

52:44.106 --> 52:47.676
Can we just have screen
time back at our hotel?

52:49.145 --> 52:50.277
Sure.

52:50.279 --> 52:51.881
I like that, yeah.

52:52.882 --> 52:54.214
Yes!

52:54.216 --> 52:56.482
Good!

52:56.484 --> 52:59.188
Whoa.

53:01.424 --> 53:03.123
How about that?

53:03.125 --> 53:04.724
That's a lot
of work, huh?

53:04.726 --> 53:06.126
But good, yes?

53:06.128 --> 53:08.329
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

53:08.331 --> 53:11.432
So, how do
your calves feel?

53:11.434 --> 53:13.466
Well, I can feel them
all right.

53:13.468 --> 53:15.169
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

53:15.171 --> 53:16.236
Good.

53:16.238 --> 53:18.906
Maybe you want to,
yeah, take them out.

53:18.908 --> 53:19.807
Yeah, I think so.

53:19.809 --> 53:20.908
For, like, 10 minutes
or something.

53:20.910 --> 53:23.576
Yeah, my right boot
in particular

53:23.578 --> 53:25.680
is driving me crazy.

53:26.315 --> 53:27.448
They can
burn here, no?

53:27.450 --> 53:28.650
Yes.

53:33.456 --> 53:37.226
You know, sometimes
I can give people,

53:38.593 --> 53:42.129
on the calves or something,
like a rub, you know?

53:43.466 --> 53:46.200
Oh. Sometimes you can do that, can you?

53:46.202 --> 53:47.769
Yeah. That's something I do.

53:49.171 --> 53:50.304
Oh, you do?

53:50.306 --> 53:54.010
Yeah. Just to, you know,
relax out those tight muscles.

53:55.478 --> 53:56.977
It's recommended.

53:56.979 --> 53:57.911
Oh, really?

53:57.913 --> 53:59.645
Well, if it's
recommended, yeah.

53:59.647 --> 54:01.549
- Sure.
- Let me.

54:02.251 --> 54:03.551
Yeah.

54:05.754 --> 54:07.388
Sorry, I'm a little sweaty.

54:07.390 --> 54:08.690
It's okay.

54:09.291 --> 54:10.625
You have nice feet.

54:10.993 --> 54:12.359
Oh.

54:16.465 --> 54:17.933
So...

54:19.001 --> 54:20.269
I'm curious.

54:20.803 --> 54:22.002
Yeah?

54:22.004 --> 54:23.005
Who is Billie?

54:25.074 --> 54:26.075
What?

54:27.542 --> 54:29.575
Why is that silly?
I want to know.

54:31.814 --> 54:33.313
Um...

54:33.315 --> 54:34.950
It sounds sort of like a...

54:36.352 --> 54:39.086
Well, "who"?
How do you even answer?

54:39.088 --> 54:40.287
I am very confident,

54:40.289 --> 54:42.923
but I'm not afraid to
admit when I'm wrong.

54:42.925 --> 54:46.162
I tend to fall in love
too fast. Heal too slow.

54:46.761 --> 54:48.628
And I love to paint.

54:48.630 --> 54:50.864
And actually,
I'm very good at it.

54:50.866 --> 54:53.766
However, I cannot sing,
but that does not stop me

54:53.768 --> 54:55.971
from doing it every day.

54:57.772 --> 55:00.040
Skiing is a passion,

55:00.042 --> 55:03.676
but, you know,
just teaching feeds my soul.

55:03.678 --> 55:05.578
To witness people
surprise themselves,

55:05.580 --> 55:07.649
that's what I live for.

55:11.087 --> 55:14.323
And, uh, I am the only
child of a single mom,

55:15.657 --> 55:17.293
and she is my hero.

55:18.427 --> 55:20.360
Oh, that's lovely.

55:20.362 --> 55:23.265
That's how I answer.

55:25.334 --> 55:26.802
You know,

55:28.670 --> 55:31.706
you don't have to share
with me who you are, Billie.

55:33.708 --> 55:35.211
But you must promise me.

55:35.945 --> 55:36.910
What?

55:36.912 --> 55:39.146
Promise me you're not
gonna find it silly

55:39.148 --> 55:41.884
if someone wants to
make it about you.

55:42.418 --> 55:44.086
I promise that.

55:52.760 --> 55:54.230
Okay. Um...

55:55.264 --> 55:56.662
Thank you very much.

55:56.664 --> 55:59.133
I'm sorry. <i>Scusami.</i>
I apologize if I...

55:59.135 --> 56:00.434
Do not apologize.

56:00.436 --> 56:03.370
I did exactly
what I wanted to do.

56:03.372 --> 56:06.006
Yeah. And now
I, uh, wanna ski.

56:06.008 --> 56:06.874
Yeah.

56:06.876 --> 56:08.410
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

56:10.212 --> 56:11.213
Okay.

56:12.680 --> 56:14.515
But just to be clear,

56:14.517 --> 56:16.483
I could fuck you
right through that wall

56:16.485 --> 56:17.683
right now if I wanted.

56:17.685 --> 56:19.820
But I won't.
And I wouldn't.

56:19.822 --> 56:21.788
That much I know about me.

56:21.790 --> 56:25.227
In answer to your
earlier question.

57:11.773 --> 57:13.574
Oh, my God.

57:22.651 --> 57:24.053
Oh.

57:30.092 --> 57:31.093
Okay.

57:32.928 --> 57:34.830
Ah. There are my gloves.

57:55.750 --> 57:56.984
How was your solo day?

57:56.986 --> 57:58.619
It was great. Yeah.

57:58.621 --> 57:59.888
Awesome.

58:09.665 --> 58:11.200
Me and the boys had fun.

58:11.734 --> 58:13.133
Good.

58:13.135 --> 58:16.038
Yeah, we spent a good
while on the slide.

58:17.273 --> 58:18.274
Great.

59:00.015 --> 59:01.315
That's funny.

59:01.317 --> 59:02.249
Morning.

59:02.251 --> 59:04.084
- Morning, Dad.
- Morning.

59:04.086 --> 59:05.120
Hey.

59:07.623 --> 59:08.889
Everybody sleep okay?

59:08.891 --> 59:10.526
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

59:14.830 --> 59:16.231
Are we, um...

59:16.832 --> 59:18.832
Um, we're just...

59:18.834 --> 59:21.768
We're gonna just
do this for now.

59:21.770 --> 59:23.970
- Okay.
- Yeah.

59:23.972 --> 59:26.006
Yeah, Zach had texted
about joining us.

59:26.008 --> 59:28.008
I think Rosie's
sleeping in, so...

59:28.010 --> 59:29.811
Oh. Great.

59:29.813 --> 59:32.314
Okay. Well,
you guys have fun.

59:35.651 --> 59:37.451
Should we meet up for dinner?

59:37.453 --> 59:39.086
Maybe a place in town?

59:39.088 --> 59:40.155
Sure.

59:42.691 --> 59:44.291
So I'll text you.

59:44.293 --> 59:45.359
Okay.

59:45.361 --> 59:46.362
Cool.

59:47.296 --> 59:48.297
All right.

59:48.897 --> 59:49.963
All right, guys. Have fun.

59:49.965 --> 59:51.064
- Okay. We will.
- You too.

59:51.066 --> 59:52.132
- Bye.
- Bye.

59:52.134 --> 59:54.134
- Bye.
- Okay.

59:54.136 --> 59:56.605
I like pugs, too.
They're just unbeatable.

59:57.873 --> 59:59.541
I'm not gonna get over that.

1:00:10.252 --> 1:00:11.253
Whoo!

1:00:11.788 --> 1:00:12.988
Yeah!

1:00:15.190 --> 1:00:16.390
I mean,

1:00:16.392 --> 1:00:17.891
how great is this?

1:00:17.893 --> 1:00:19.459
Oh, my God! Look at this.

1:00:19.461 --> 1:00:21.695
It's like one of those
screensavers.

1:00:21.697 --> 1:00:24.097
We're in a stock image
right now.

1:00:24.099 --> 1:00:26.566
There's only one thing I have
to worry about right now.

1:00:26.568 --> 1:00:27.667
Okay.

1:00:27.669 --> 1:00:29.469
Only one obligation.

1:00:29.471 --> 1:00:31.138
And that's going down.

1:00:31.140 --> 1:00:32.372
- That's it.
- Yeah.

1:00:32.374 --> 1:00:34.741
- Just live your best life.
- That's it.

1:00:34.743 --> 1:00:35.843
Yeah.

1:00:35.845 --> 1:00:37.479
Every day is all we have.

1:00:38.247 --> 1:00:40.082
- Fuck yeah, man.
- Right?

1:00:40.416 --> 1:00:41.917
Fucking A.

1:00:46.955 --> 1:00:48.355
Whoo!

1:01:07.409 --> 1:01:09.409
Shit!

1:01:09.411 --> 1:01:10.612
Idiot!

1:01:27.996 --> 1:01:29.565
Do I seem
okay to you?

1:01:30.632 --> 1:01:32.800
Yeah. I think.

1:01:32.802 --> 1:01:34.802
You don't think
I have a concussion?

1:01:34.804 --> 1:01:36.436
No, I don't think so,

1:01:36.438 --> 1:01:38.371
because you didn't
puke or anything.

1:01:38.373 --> 1:01:39.406
No, no, no.

1:01:39.408 --> 1:01:40.875
No, I haven't
felt nauseous.

1:01:40.877 --> 1:01:42.678
Have I been
repeating myself?

1:01:44.680 --> 1:01:45.880
I don't know.

1:01:45.882 --> 1:01:48.215
I mean, like, you've asked me
a few times if you seem okay.

1:01:48.217 --> 1:01:50.350
- But that's it?
- Yeah.

1:01:50.352 --> 1:01:52.152
Hi. Hi.

1:01:52.154 --> 1:01:53.987
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

1:01:53.989 --> 1:01:55.288
Yeah. Uh...

1:01:55.290 --> 1:01:58.658
My friend just
wanted to say hi.

1:01:58.660 --> 1:01:59.661
- Ooh.
- Oh.

1:02:00.229 --> 1:02:01.461
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:02:01.463 --> 1:02:04.698
She likes the way
you carry yourself.

1:02:04.700 --> 1:02:06.466
- That's very kind.
- Yeah.

1:02:06.468 --> 1:02:07.503
Yeah, where, uh...

1:02:09.071 --> 1:02:10.670
Oh, yeah.
That's nice.

1:02:10.672 --> 1:02:11.839
Oh, my God.

1:02:11.841 --> 1:02:15.644
She thinks you are the
best-groomed man in this bar.

1:02:17.546 --> 1:02:18.678
Well, thank you.

1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:19.681
Yeah.

1:02:22.484 --> 1:02:24.050
Uh... Okay.

1:02:24.052 --> 1:02:26.255
That's okay, right?

1:02:27.356 --> 1:02:28.990
Check you out.

1:02:28.992 --> 1:02:30.490
What do we...

1:02:30.492 --> 1:02:34.929
I mean, do we
send a drink over?

1:02:34.931 --> 1:02:36.429
Should we go,
just talk to them?

1:02:36.431 --> 1:02:39.633
I think for me, you know,
with Rosie...

1:02:39.635 --> 1:02:41.468
No. No, no. Right.

1:02:41.470 --> 1:02:44.304
I mean, I'm already punching
above my weight there,

1:02:44.306 --> 1:02:45.505
and I don't want
to mess that up.

1:02:45.507 --> 1:02:46.941
Oh, my God,
no, you got a good thing.

1:02:46.943 --> 1:02:48.575
- Yeah. Totally.
- Yeah.

1:02:48.577 --> 1:02:52.178
She's, like,
changed my life and I love...

1:02:52.180 --> 1:02:53.881
Yeah, that's good to hear.

1:02:53.883 --> 1:02:55.083
I love it.

1:02:55.584 --> 1:02:56.516
I mean, you know,

1:02:56.518 --> 1:02:58.084
the whole
moving to Europe thing...

1:02:58.086 --> 1:02:59.352
I don't know if I'd
really want to be that far

1:02:59.354 --> 1:03:01.056
- from my family...
- Mmm-hmm.

1:03:01.657 --> 1:03:02.823
...and she's pretty adamant

1:03:02.825 --> 1:03:04.724
about not wanting
kids, but me...

1:03:04.726 --> 1:03:05.727
Right.

1:03:06.695 --> 1:03:08.128
I don't know.

1:03:08.130 --> 1:03:11.133
But for now, yeah.
Yeah, we're good.

1:03:12.035 --> 1:03:13.166
Wow.

1:03:13.168 --> 1:03:14.802
Man, I did not
hate that.

1:03:14.804 --> 1:03:15.870
Oh. Yeah.

1:03:15.872 --> 1:03:17.339
It's been a while.

1:03:18.307 --> 1:03:20.607
I used to be good
at flirting, too.

1:03:20.609 --> 1:03:21.675
Really?

1:03:21.677 --> 1:03:23.143
I mean, really good.

1:03:23.145 --> 1:03:24.812
Well, you have
that energy.

1:03:24.814 --> 1:03:25.947
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:03:25.949 --> 1:03:27.080
- Still?
- You do.

1:03:27.082 --> 1:03:28.214
- Hi.
- Hello again.

1:03:28.216 --> 1:03:30.051
- Sorry.
- Hello. Hi.

1:03:30.053 --> 1:03:31.618
It wasn't you.

1:03:31.620 --> 1:03:32.752
What's that?

1:03:32.754 --> 1:03:35.221
It wasn't you.

1:03:35.223 --> 1:03:37.858
She didn't like the way
you carried yourself.

1:03:37.860 --> 1:03:39.328
- Oh.
- It was him.

1:03:41.798 --> 1:03:43.330
The green man.

1:03:44.600 --> 1:03:46.000
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

1:03:46.002 --> 1:03:47.500
Hey, so what's your name?

1:03:47.502 --> 1:03:48.537
Bye.

1:03:56.111 --> 1:03:57.780
Yeah, she's right.

1:03:58.881 --> 1:04:00.883
That guy is a catch.

1:04:05.955 --> 1:04:07.756
Yeah, can I be honest
with you, Pete?

1:04:09.092 --> 1:04:10.925
I do see a resemblance.

1:04:10.927 --> 1:04:12.059
- No.
- Yes.

1:04:12.061 --> 1:04:13.727
Come on. No, it's okay.

1:04:13.729 --> 1:04:15.631
Honestly. I'm good.

1:04:16.431 --> 1:04:17.633
I'm so good.

1:04:18.500 --> 1:04:19.668
So much so.

1:04:23.772 --> 1:04:26.673
So, do you feel
like skiing more?

1:04:26.675 --> 1:04:28.109
No.

1:04:28.111 --> 1:04:29.812
Let's just keep drinking.

1:04:36.518 --> 1:04:37.584
Billie?

1:04:37.586 --> 1:04:38.652
Yes?

1:04:38.654 --> 1:04:40.453
Hey!
Oh, hi, guys.

1:04:40.455 --> 1:04:42.255
- Hi.
- You going up?

1:04:42.257 --> 1:04:44.959
Um, yeah.
We... Yes.

1:04:44.961 --> 1:04:46.226
Do you mind
if I...?

1:04:46.228 --> 1:04:48.662
Oh, sure, yeah.
Join us. Absolutely.

1:04:48.664 --> 1:04:49.797
- Mom.
- Yes?

1:04:49.799 --> 1:04:50.931
Can we go up
by ourselves?

1:04:50.933 --> 1:04:52.632
- Sure, yeah, if you want to.
- Yeah, let's do that. Yes!

1:04:52.634 --> 1:04:54.101
But can you wait for me
at the top? Okay?

1:04:54.103 --> 1:04:55.370
- Yeah, we will.
- Okay.

1:04:57.106 --> 1:04:58.238
Look at this.

1:04:58.240 --> 1:04:59.506
Yeah. Stunning.

1:04:59.508 --> 1:05:01.675
The sun
is really poking out now.

1:05:01.677 --> 1:05:02.744
Mmm-hmm.

1:05:04.881 --> 1:05:07.582
So, how you doing today?

1:05:08.517 --> 1:05:09.817
Um...

1:05:09.819 --> 1:05:12.686
I'm better, I guess.

1:05:12.688 --> 1:05:13.956
Well, I don't know.

1:05:14.924 --> 1:05:17.290
I am so sorry

1:05:17.292 --> 1:05:21.494
that you guys were there for
all of that the other night.

1:05:21.496 --> 1:05:23.064
I know that we just met.

1:05:23.066 --> 1:05:24.698
Why are you apologizing?

1:05:24.700 --> 1:05:28.201
Well, I shouldn't have
involved the kids like that.

1:05:28.203 --> 1:05:29.536
That was not wise.

1:05:29.538 --> 1:05:33.306
Okay, fine, but you have
nothing to apologize about.

1:05:33.308 --> 1:05:34.844
What he did was fucked up.

1:05:36.244 --> 1:05:38.745
Yeah, but...

1:05:38.747 --> 1:05:41.249
I probably shouldn't have
attacked him like that.

1:05:42.819 --> 1:05:44.517
He's grieving right now.

1:05:44.519 --> 1:05:47.220
A lot. 'Cause his dad died
about eight months ago.

1:05:47.222 --> 1:05:49.656
People die.
It happens. It sucks.

1:05:49.658 --> 1:05:51.224
But that doesn't excuse
why he ran away

1:05:51.226 --> 1:05:52.659
like a fucking pussy.

1:05:52.661 --> 1:05:55.495
You don't
owe him anything.

1:05:55.497 --> 1:05:57.432
You have a right
to be angry.

1:06:05.307 --> 1:06:06.708
Thank you.

1:06:08.211 --> 1:06:09.542
I'll tell you this much.

1:06:09.544 --> 1:06:12.113
If Zach ever did that to me,
I would kick him in the nuts

1:06:12.115 --> 1:06:14.247
and he would never
see me again.

1:06:14.249 --> 1:06:16.418
It's black and white.

1:06:17.220 --> 1:06:18.420
Well...

1:06:22.992 --> 1:06:24.191
I'm not sure.

1:06:24.193 --> 1:06:25.759
No, it is.

1:06:25.761 --> 1:06:27.295
It's black and white.

1:06:30.565 --> 1:06:32.900
How old are you?

1:06:32.902 --> 1:06:34.269
- Thirty.
- Oh.

1:06:50.418 --> 1:06:52.487
- We're home.
- Yeah.

1:07:13.142 --> 1:07:15.343
Mmm. Mmm-mmm.

1:07:33.262 --> 1:07:35.029
Hey, green guy.

1:07:39.302 --> 1:07:41.403
I got it. Got it.

1:07:43.772 --> 1:07:44.773
Jerk.

1:07:54.749 --> 1:07:55.883
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:07:55.885 --> 1:07:56.986
You all right?

1:07:58.020 --> 1:07:59.387
You gotta get some air.

1:08:00.223 --> 1:08:01.756
This place is dead.

1:08:02.859 --> 1:08:04.091
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:08:04.093 --> 1:08:05.425
Okay.

1:08:05.427 --> 1:08:08.064
We should get you out of here.
It's almost 7:00.

1:08:10.132 --> 1:08:12.902
Whoa. Okay. Hey.

1:08:13.602 --> 1:08:14.869
Okay.

1:08:14.871 --> 1:08:16.804
- I think it's time for pizza.
- No.

1:08:16.806 --> 1:08:19.006
- Or coffee or something.
- No.

1:08:19.008 --> 1:08:21.541
No. I gotta stay hungry

1:08:21.543 --> 1:08:24.111
for dinner
with my family. So...

1:08:24.113 --> 1:08:25.212
Yeah.

1:08:25.214 --> 1:08:26.646
I just think before
you see your family,

1:08:26.648 --> 1:08:28.148
it might be a good idea
to get some food.

1:08:28.150 --> 1:08:29.651
I love my family.

1:08:30.452 --> 1:08:33.053
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay?

1:08:33.055 --> 1:08:34.687
- I know.
- I do.

1:08:34.689 --> 1:08:35.724
I know.

1:08:36.792 --> 1:08:38.959
Billie and I didn't even
think of doing it

1:08:38.961 --> 1:08:40.693
for the longest time.

1:08:40.695 --> 1:08:41.696
Kids.

1:08:42.464 --> 1:08:44.597
So we did
the fertility thing.

1:08:44.599 --> 1:08:46.699
And then we
just said, you know,

1:08:46.701 --> 1:08:50.037
if science wants us
to be parents,

1:08:50.039 --> 1:08:51.437
then we'll be parents.

1:08:51.439 --> 1:08:53.876
If not, that's okay.

1:08:56.812 --> 1:08:59.445
And science
made us parents.

1:08:59.447 --> 1:09:02.016
Yeah, I mean, you got
a beautiful family.

1:09:02.018 --> 1:09:07.453
You lose a parent and
the ticking gets louder.

1:09:07.455 --> 1:09:10.157
I mean, you really wanna
know how old you are?

1:09:10.159 --> 1:09:12.192
Look at your kids.

1:09:12.194 --> 1:09:14.030
Every day they change.

1:09:17.033 --> 1:09:18.698
I mean, yeah, we get older.

1:09:18.700 --> 1:09:21.103
But you can't forget
about you.

1:09:22.038 --> 1:09:23.605
It happens.

1:09:24.407 --> 1:09:26.809
You think about yourself.

1:09:31.479 --> 1:09:32.982
Yeah, I know.

1:09:36.052 --> 1:09:37.719
Hey, Pete.

1:09:38.988 --> 1:09:39.989
Come here.

1:09:43.326 --> 1:09:44.526
Pete,

1:09:45.328 --> 1:09:46.894
we're gonna
get you coffee.

1:09:46.896 --> 1:09:48.796
I know.
That's what I said.

1:09:48.798 --> 1:09:49.799
Right?

1:09:50.266 --> 1:09:52.068
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1:09:54.103 --> 1:09:55.838
I got you.

1:10:20.329 --> 1:10:21.529
Yum.

1:10:22.898 --> 1:10:23.899
Yours?

1:10:24.632 --> 1:10:26.035
I'm not that hungry.

1:10:27.702 --> 1:10:29.602
Okay. Did you already eat?

1:10:29.604 --> 1:10:31.905
'Cause I didn't eat
to stay hungry.

1:10:31.907 --> 1:10:33.209
So I'm hungry.

1:10:35.978 --> 1:10:37.512
All right.

1:10:41.784 --> 1:10:43.718
Mom, keycard.
Keycard.

1:10:45.021 --> 1:10:46.088
Thanks.

1:10:52.194 --> 1:10:53.659
Billie? Billie, stop.

1:10:53.661 --> 1:10:55.329
Can I just say something?
Please?

1:10:55.331 --> 1:10:56.797
- Well, I...
- Can I?

1:10:56.799 --> 1:10:58.465
Pete, honestly,
it's not a good idea.

1:10:58.467 --> 1:10:59.800
No, I just...

1:10:59.802 --> 1:11:02.336
It's really not a good idea
to do this right now.

1:11:02.338 --> 1:11:04.171
Please. Let me just...

1:11:04.173 --> 1:11:06.507
Billie, just listen to me.

1:11:06.509 --> 1:11:09.109
What happened

1:11:09.111 --> 1:11:12.214
is what you said happened.

1:11:15.284 --> 1:11:16.651
I ran.

1:11:20.322 --> 1:11:22.858
I didn't know how
to make sense of it.

1:11:23.492 --> 1:11:25.161
I didn't want to.

1:11:26.328 --> 1:11:28.264
It's not like I didn't see it.

1:11:29.398 --> 1:11:31.965
I keep seeing it, Billie.

1:11:31.967 --> 1:11:34.303
I see it now.
How you look at me.

1:11:36.539 --> 1:11:38.606
And how our sons
look at me.

1:11:40.209 --> 1:11:41.743
I hate it.

1:11:44.646 --> 1:11:47.314
I was just afraid that
if I said it out loud,

1:11:47.316 --> 1:11:49.018
then it would be true.

1:11:49.751 --> 1:11:53.122
I'm just a selfish coward.

1:11:54.023 --> 1:11:55.155
Capable of...

1:11:55.157 --> 1:11:57.927
This is what you say
four days ago, Pete.

1:11:59.028 --> 1:12:02.662
Instead, you made me feel
like a complete idiot.

1:12:02.664 --> 1:12:04.431
Like it was my fault.

1:12:04.433 --> 1:12:05.966
I can't stop
an avalanche, Billie.

1:12:05.968 --> 1:12:08.469
No one is asking you
to stop an avalanche.

1:12:08.471 --> 1:12:10.237
What are you even
talking about?

1:12:10.239 --> 1:12:14.243
I just want you to want to
survive one with us, Pete.

1:12:43.405 --> 1:12:44.538
Morning.

1:12:44.540 --> 1:12:46.039
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1:12:46.041 --> 1:12:47.274
Morning.

1:12:47.276 --> 1:12:48.277
Morning.

1:12:49.044 --> 1:12:50.743
Morning.

1:12:50.745 --> 1:12:53.082
Looks like we got hit
with a big dump of snow.

1:13:02.124 --> 1:13:05.192
Should we, uh, head
to the top of the mountain?

1:13:05.194 --> 1:13:08.230
For a final run?
Tackle the Beast?

1:13:08.730 --> 1:13:10.199
Yeah, sure.

1:13:17.173 --> 1:13:19.640
Does that sound good?
Tackle the Beast?

1:13:19.642 --> 1:13:20.843
Sure.

1:13:22.244 --> 1:13:25.114
Unless I decide
to go to Switzerland.

1:13:50.772 --> 1:13:52.940
I hate skiing.

1:13:52.942 --> 1:13:54.441
- No, he doesn't.
- Finn.

1:13:54.443 --> 1:13:55.741
You're not in my body.

1:13:55.743 --> 1:13:57.678
It's cold and dumb.

1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:00.147
You're always wet and
it hurts when you fall.

1:14:00.149 --> 1:14:03.317
It takes forever if you
have to go to the bathroom.

1:14:03.319 --> 1:14:04.750
People are just stupid.

1:14:04.752 --> 1:14:05.986
They don't look
where they're going,

1:14:05.988 --> 1:14:08.057
so you're always scared
you're gonna die.

1:14:08.857 --> 1:14:11.260
And I have to go
to the bathroom.

1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:33.415
Oh.

1:14:34.250 --> 1:14:35.482
Hey, hey.

1:14:35.484 --> 1:14:37.017
It's okay, you guys.

1:14:37.019 --> 1:14:39.021
It's okay. You're fine.

1:14:40.256 --> 1:14:41.523
I'm here.

1:14:58.607 --> 1:15:01.010
You know, I think
I'm all skied out.

1:15:04.813 --> 1:15:06.346
I say we call it.

1:15:06.348 --> 1:15:07.948
Get some hot cocoa?

1:15:07.950 --> 1:15:09.885
- Warm up? Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:15:12.054 --> 1:15:13.989
Honey,
why don't you go ahead?

1:15:15.024 --> 1:15:17.359
We'll wait for you,
down at the bottom.

1:15:21.397 --> 1:15:22.531
Come on, guys.

1:16:19.888 --> 1:16:21.623
Where is she?

1:16:28.832 --> 1:16:30.299
Pete!

1:16:33.135 --> 1:16:34.570
Pete!

1:16:35.771 --> 1:16:36.838
Peter!

1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:38.105
Stay here.

1:16:38.107 --> 1:16:39.005
Dad!

1:16:39.007 --> 1:16:40.309
Just stay right here.

1:16:41.443 --> 1:16:42.611
Peter!

1:16:47.784 --> 1:16:49.418
Peter!

1:17:15.879 --> 1:17:17.079
Hey.

1:17:19.681 --> 1:17:21.383
You okay?

1:17:22.651 --> 1:17:24.486
This is for our boys.

1:17:25.053 --> 1:17:27.189
For how they see you.

1:17:31.026 --> 1:17:36.263
But as far as you
and I are concerned,

1:17:36.265 --> 1:17:39.901
if you don't like the way
that I look at you,

1:17:39.903 --> 1:17:43.003
then show me
something different.

1:17:43.005 --> 1:17:47.674
You show me someone
who really wants to be here.

1:17:47.676 --> 1:17:48.810
But I do.

1:17:48.812 --> 1:17:51.380
No, I mean
through it all, Pete.

1:17:52.614 --> 1:17:54.383
Because if you can't,

1:17:56.418 --> 1:17:59.354
then you can just go down
the mountain by yourself.

1:17:59.755 --> 1:18:01.657
No, I'm here.

1:18:02.458 --> 1:18:04.126
For all of it.

1:18:17.105 --> 1:18:19.174
Now rescue me.

1:18:26.715 --> 1:18:27.981
What happened, Mom?

1:18:27.983 --> 1:18:29.483
Yeah, are you okay?

1:18:29.485 --> 1:18:31.653
Yeah. I'm fine.

1:18:32.421 --> 1:18:33.755
She's good.

1:18:39.495 --> 1:18:40.994
Oh.

1:18:40.996 --> 1:18:42.664
I forgot my skis.

1:18:43.499 --> 1:18:45.131
Oh.

1:18:45.133 --> 1:18:48.003
Okay, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay.

1:19:03.418 --> 1:19:05.118
Please, guys, slow.

1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:06.355
Watch it!

1:19:10.359 --> 1:19:11.224
Hey!

1:19:13.897 --> 1:19:16.298
Until we meet
in a different lifetime.

1:19:17.766 --> 1:19:20.267
- Is he talking to you?
- Mmm.

1:19:20.269 --> 1:19:22.435
Yeah, that's, um,
my ski instructor.

1:19:22.437 --> 1:19:24.170
Oh, I didn't know
you took a ski lesson.

1:19:24.172 --> 1:19:25.572
Yeah, I told you that.

1:19:25.574 --> 1:19:26.575
You did?

1:19:27.109 --> 1:19:28.742
Wait, what?

1:19:28.744 --> 1:19:30.176
Hashtag we refuse
to leave.

1:19:30.178 --> 1:19:31.545
- Hi!
- Oh, hey!

1:19:31.547 --> 1:19:33.246
Hashtag not leaving.

1:19:33.248 --> 1:19:34.514
God.

1:19:34.516 --> 1:19:36.984
- I am getting so sick of that.
- I don't know why that's fun.

1:19:36.986 --> 1:19:39.020
- Oh, you guys.
- Hey.

1:19:39.022 --> 1:19:41.221
- Safe travels.
- All right. You too.

1:19:41.223 --> 1:19:42.524
Really nice
to meet you.
