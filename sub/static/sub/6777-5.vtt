ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, LP.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.636
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T
ACCEPT THE COMPLIMENTARY MAP

01:46.740 --> 01:48.139
AT THE TRAIL HEAD.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.663
MAYBE BECAUSE I'VE DONE
THIS HIKE 100 TIMES BEFORE.

01:50.770 --> 01:52.408
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO INSISTED

01:52.510 --> 01:54.831
ON MAKING A LEFI'
AT THE LAST MARKER.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.579
BECAUSE THE OTHER WAY
DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A TRAIL !

01:57.680 --> 01:58.874
THAT WAS THE TRAIL !

01:58.980 --> 02:00.743
FINE.

02:00.850 --> 02:03.045
EVERYTHING IS
MY FAULT.

02:03.150 --> 02:04.845
EVERYTHING
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.486
NOT EVERYTHING.

02:06.590 --> 02:08.455
JUST THE FACT THAT
WE'RE NOW TOTALLY LOST

02:08.560 --> 02:10.187
AND I'M TOTALLY
DEHYDRATED.

02:10.290 --> 02:12.724
OH, WELL, IF YOU WERE SO SURE
ABOUT THE DAMN TRAIL,

02:12.830 --> 02:16.425
WHICH YOU WEREN'T, THEN WHY
DIDN'T YOU JUST GO AND--

02:16.530 --> 02:19.328
WHAT IS THAT
DOWN THERE ?

02:21.100 --> 02:24.160
I TOLD YOU THERE WAS SOMETHING,
BUT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.

02:24.270 --> 02:25.532
YOU NEVER
BELIEVE ME.

02:25.640 --> 02:26.902
YOU THINK I'M JUST
LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

02:27.010 --> 02:28.170
NO, I DON'T.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.645
YES, YOU DO, JUST BE
HONEST FOR ONCE.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.275
OH MY GOD.

02:32.380 --> 02:35.178
SOMETHING'S MOVING.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.488
SOMEBODY'S IN THERE,
THEY'RE TRAPPED.

02:38.590 --> 02:39.750
NO, THEY'RE NOT.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.589
(canng)

02:55.540 --> 02:59.829
MUST'VE DRIVEN OFF
THAT DIRT ROAD UP THERE.

02:59.940 --> 03:01.771
IT'S BEEN SITTING
HERE FOR YEARS.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.973
PEOPLE ARE HORRIBLE.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.308
WHY WOULD THEY
HAVE AN ACCIDENT,

03:05.410 --> 03:07.139
AND THEN JUST LEAVE
THEIR CAR TO ROT ?

03:07.250 --> 03:11.243
MAYBE BECAUSE
THEY'RE STILL IN IT.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.031
OKAY, I'M FADING.

03:31.140 --> 03:32.869
I CAN'T EVEN
KEEP MY EYES OPEN.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.572
I NEED TO GET
A CUP OF COFFEE.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.898
YOU FELL ASLEEP WHEN WE WERE
ON THE PHONE LAST NIGHT.

03:37.010 --> 03:38.204
I DID NOT.

03:38.310 --> 03:39.618
( laughing )

03:39.720 --> 03:41.711
I WAS TALKING FOR LIKE
30 MINUTES STRAIGHT

03:41.820 --> 03:44.141
AND I WAS THINKING,
WOW, IT'S SO GOOD

03:44.250 --> 03:47.048
TO GET THESE
THINGS OUT, AND THEN...

03:47.160 --> 03:49.685
( snoring )

03:49.790 --> 03:51.257
I'M SORRY.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.793
I HAVEN'T SLEPT
IN LIKE THREE NIGHTS,

03:52.900 --> 03:55.357
I'VE BEEN DEVOURING THIS
CAMILLE CLAUDEL BIOGRAPHY.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.621
DO YOU REMEMBER ME
TELLING YOU THAT

03:57.730 --> 03:59.459
MY BROTHER'S GETTING
MARRIED ON SATURDAY ?

03:59.570 --> 04:01.731
YES, TO THE WOMAN
WITH NO CHIN.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.207
THAT'S RIGHT, SO I DIDN'T
TOTALLY BORE YOU.

04:05.310 --> 04:07.733
I KNOW IT'S KIND
OF LAST MINUTE,

04:07.840 --> 04:11.606
BUT I WAS THINKING MAYBE
IF YOU WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING...

04:11.710 --> 04:16.170
UM, I MEAN, IF IT WOULDN'T
BE COMPLETELY PAINFUL FOR YOU

04:16.290 --> 04:18.747
TO COME WITH ME ?

04:18.850 --> 04:21.956
UM--

04:22.060 --> 04:23.152
IT'S NOT A DATE.

04:23.260 --> 04:26.252
IT SOUNDS LIKE A DATE,
BUT IT'S NOT.

04:30.370 --> 04:31.496
OKAY, IT'S A DATE.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.797
YOU WOULD
BE MY DATE.

04:37.710 --> 04:38.836
SURE.

04:38.940 --> 04:40.999
I MEAN, WHY NOT ?

04:41.110 --> 04:43.249
OF COURSE
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.602
OKAY, IT GOT WEIRD,
DIDN'T IT ?

04:45.710 --> 04:47.143
AND I DID IT.

04:47.250 --> 04:49.480
I HATE LIFE.

04:54.890 --> 04:56.528
( clearing throat)

04:56.630 --> 04:58.928
WHAT'S WITH
THE CHITI'Y CHAT ?

04:59.030 --> 05:00.622
HMM ?

05:00.730 --> 05:02.322
YOU CAN FOCUS
ON YOUR WORK,

05:02.430 --> 05:04.159
OR YOU CAN GOSSIP
LIKE OLD BLIND WOMEN.

05:04.270 --> 05:06.932
IT'S YOUR DECISION.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.939
FINALLY YOU DRAW WHAT YOU SEE,
NOT WHAT YOU THINK YOU SEE.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.009
I LIKE IT.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.944
CLAIRE, YOU AND I
SHOULD TALK.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.820
LOOK, EVERYTHING
I DO SUCKS TODAY.

05:35.930 --> 05:37.227
I KNOW,
I'VE JUST LIKE--

05:37.330 --> 05:39.025
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT YOUR WORK.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.860
CLAIRE...

05:41.970 --> 05:45.565
( chattering )

05:50.880 --> 05:54.611
( laughing )

05:56.790 --> 05:57.939
THANK YOU.

05:58.050 --> 05:58.880
OF COURSE.

05:58.990 --> 06:00.685
OF COURSE.
THANK YOU.

06:00.790 --> 06:02.826
OKAY.

06:04.660 --> 06:07.390
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BELIEVE THIS.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.559
OLIVIER JUST ASKED ME
TO BE HIS ASSISTANT.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.319
AND I START
TOMORROW.

06:11.430 --> 06:13.591
I DON'T
BELIEVE THIS.

06:13.700 --> 06:16.134
I FEEL LIKE I JUST
WON SOMETHING.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.333
I NEVER
WIN ANYTHING.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.908
ME NEITHER.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.818
UM, I GUESS ANY
OF THESE WOULD BE FINE.

06:26.920 --> 06:31.118
HONEY, YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE TO PICK ONE.

06:31.220 --> 06:32.858
CHRIS, PLEASE.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.882
HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF CASKET

06:34.990 --> 06:36.457
WILL WOULD WANT ?

06:36.560 --> 06:38.585
HE DISAPPEARED OVER
25 YEARS AGO.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.749
AND I CAN HARDLY REMEMBER
HOW HE TOOK HIS COFFEE.

06:40.860 --> 06:43.829
I MYSELF LIKE
THE DELUXE AEGEAN.

06:43.930 --> 06:46.319
IT'S A LITTLE ON THE HIGH END,
BUT IT'S VERY CALMING.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.035
IT'S LIKE A SLOW,
LULLING RIDE ON...

06:50.140 --> 06:54.577
ON THE AEGEAN,
I GUESS.

06:54.680 --> 06:58.002
I NEED TO SIT DOWN.

06:58.110 --> 06:59.407
TAKE YOUR TIME,

06:59.520 --> 07:03.741
THERE'S NO HURRY, WE KNOW
HOW HARD THIS IS FOR YOU.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.456
HE, UM...

07:06.560 --> 07:10.189
WENT OUT FOR A NEWSPAPER
ONE DAY AND NEVER CAME BACK.

07:10.290 --> 07:13.953
SO, I FIGURED
HE DESERTED ME.

07:14.060 --> 07:15.698
WHICH MADE SENSE.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.461
BECAUSE WE WERE
ONE OF THOSE HORRIBLE

07:17.570 --> 07:20.289
GOT-MARRIED-TOO-SOON-FOR-ALL-
THE-WRONG-REASONS COUPLES.

07:20.400 --> 07:25.463
NOW, I FIND OUT
HE DIDN'T RUN AWAY AT ALL,

07:25.570 --> 07:27.936
HE DIED
IN A FREAK ACCIDENT.

07:28.040 --> 07:31.373
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH ALL THESE YEARS

07:31.480 --> 07:33.448
OF FEELING
LIKE HE DESERTED US ?

07:33.550 --> 07:35.814
HONEY, WE DON'T EVEN
NEED TO DO A FUNERAL.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.184
IT'S JUST
AN EMPTY RITUAL.

07:38.290 --> 07:42.488
ACTUALLY, THE CLOSURE
IT PROVIDES IS QUITE POWERFUL.

07:42.590 --> 07:44.626
AND QUITE HEALING.

07:44.730 --> 07:48.097
THE STRANGE PART
IS WHERE THEY FOUND HIM.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.169
IN THAT CANYON, IT WAS 10 MILES
FROM WHERE WE LIVED BACK THEN.

07:51.270 --> 07:52.669
WHAT WAS
HE DOING THERE ?

07:52.770 --> 07:55.933
WELL, MAYBE
HE GOT LOST.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.268
RIGHT.

07:57.370 --> 07:59.008
LOOKING FOR A NEWSPAPER
ON A DIRT ROAD

07:59.110 --> 08:00.134
IN THE MIDDLE
OF NOWHERE.

08:00.240 --> 08:04.108
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
HE WAS SEEING SOMEONE ELSE ?

08:04.210 --> 08:05.541
I...

08:05.650 --> 08:07.470
I HAVE NO IDEA.

08:07.580 --> 08:11.539
HE COULD HAVE BEEN.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.211
DIANE, LET'S JUST MAKE
A DECISION ON THE CASKET

08:16.320 --> 08:18.322
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

08:18.430 --> 08:21.149
WILL WAS JEWISH
SO I SUPPOSE--

08:21.260 --> 08:22.568
THE SAMPSON.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.297
IT'S PLAIN CEDAR.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.789
GOT IT.

08:50.730 --> 08:53.654
I CAN FINISH OUT THE WEEK,
IF YOU NEED, IT'S NO PROBLEM.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.627
CLAIRE, YOU GOT ANOTHER JOB,
GO DO IT.

08:56.730 --> 08:58.527
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S
AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY.

08:58.630 --> 09:00.996
TO LEARN FROM
OLIVIER CASTRO-STAAL,

09:01.100 --> 09:02.533
MAYBE EVEN HELP HIM
WITH HIS ART.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.631
AND JUST DO
SOMETHING MEANINGFUL,

09:04.740 --> 09:06.731
INSTEAD OF JUST,
YOU KNOW.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.000
FINE.

09:08.110 --> 09:09.338
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

09:09.440 --> 09:11.442
I WASN'T CRAZY ABOUT YOU DOING
PICKUPS AND DELIVERIES ANYWAY.

09:11.550 --> 09:12.847
WE HAVE ENOUGH
ACTUAL EMPLOYEES HERE

09:12.950 --> 09:14.417
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO PAY SOMEBODY EXTRA.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.114
OKAY, THAN KS.

09:17.220 --> 09:20.212
OH WAIT,
THIS IS FOR YOU.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.208
IS THAT
A GOOD-BYE GIFI' ?

09:22.320 --> 09:25.881
NO, IT'S A BOX OF BONES I JUST
PICKED UP FROM THE CORONER.

09:25.990 --> 09:27.526
WILLIAM JAFFE.

09:27.630 --> 09:29.029
HERE, CATCH.

09:29.130 --> 09:32.122
JUST KIDDING.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.405
I'M NOT SURE THIS
IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

09:38.510 --> 09:39.829
NO, NO,
IT'S PERFECT.

09:39.940 --> 09:41.339
LOOK, WE WERE SAVING SOME
BY USING CLAIRE,

09:41.440 --> 09:43.749
BUT WE CAN SAVE SERIOUS MONEY
WITH AN APPRENTICE.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.442
I'VE CRUNCHED
THE NUMBERS.

09:45.550 --> 09:46.619
YOU CAN
CRUNCH NUMBERS ?

09:46.720 --> 09:47.641
OF COURSE I CAN.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.479
LOOK, IT'S FREE LABOR,

09:49.580 --> 09:51.047
WE JUST HAVE TO GIVE HIM
A PLACE TO LIVE.

09:51.150 --> 09:52.913
HE GETS CREDIT
FOR MORTUARY SCHOOL

09:53.020 --> 09:55.159
AND WE DON'T HAVE
TO PAY HIM "BUPKISS".

09:56.460 --> 09:59.384
AS MR. F.
USED TO SAY.

09:59.490 --> 10:00.991
WELL ?

10:01.100 --> 10:02.453
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK
THIS HOUSE IS ALREADY

10:02.560 --> 10:03.766
GETTING
A LITTLE CROWDED.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.462
YOU MEAN, WITH
YOUR WIFE AND BABY ?

10:05.570 --> 10:07.060
I'M JUST SAYING...

10:07.170 --> 10:09.968
HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW SOMEONE
WILL WANT THE JOB ?

10:10.070 --> 10:12.334
I'VE GOT FIVE SENIORS
FROM CYPRESS LINED UP

10:12.440 --> 10:13.805
DYING TO INTERVIEW TODAY.

10:13.910 --> 10:15.172
I THINK
WE SHOULD DO IT.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.747
ALRIGHT, FINE.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.841
ISN'T SOMEONE GOING TO ASK ME
HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS ?

10:18.950 --> 10:21.817
AI-TER ALL, SINCE NONE
OF YOU ACTUALLY

10:21.920 --> 10:23.581
LIVE IN THE HOUSE ANYMORE,
I'LL BE THE ONE

10:23.690 --> 10:25.317
WHO IS FORCED TO COEXIST
WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER

10:25.420 --> 10:27.479
WHO COULD KILL ME
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

10:27.590 --> 10:28.750
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

10:28.860 --> 10:30.327
SHE'S RIGHT,
IT'S NOT FAIR TO HER.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.579
UH, MRS. F. ?

10:31.690 --> 10:33.851
WE COULD SAVE UP TO
$10,000 A YEAR

10:33.960 --> 10:36.190
ACCORDING
TO MY PROJECTIONS.

10:39.940 --> 10:43.535
I DON'T WANT LOUD
ROCK MUSIC IN THIS HOUSE.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.562
NO ROCK MUSIC,
GOT IT.

10:45.670 --> 10:47.774
SO, YOU GUYS WANT
TO TAKE A LOOK AT

10:47.880 --> 10:49.336
SOME OF THE RESUMES
THEY FAXED OVER ?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.806
ARE YOU KIDDING,
I'M DYING TO.

10:51.910 --> 10:54.708
YOU KNOW, MOM, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE A MARTYR ALL THE TIME.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.515
I AGREED
TO IT FOR YOU.

10:56.620 --> 10:59.088
YOU NEED TO MAKE MORE MONEY,
NOW THAT LISA IS A STAY-AT-HOME.

10:59.190 --> 11:00.384
A WHAT ?

11:00.490 --> 11:01.912
A STAY-AT-HOME MOTHER.

11:02.020 --> 11:03.783
LISA TOLD ME THAT'S
WHAT THEY'RE CALLED NOW.

11:03.890 --> 11:04.982
WHAT A TERRIBLE
EXPRESSION.

11:05.090 --> 11:06.899
LIKE YOU HAVE SOME
BRACELET ON YOUR FOOT

11:07.000 --> 11:08.024
THAT WILL RING
IF YOU LEAVE YOUR HOUSE.

11:08.130 --> 11:09.620
LISA'S GOING
BACK TO WORK.

11:09.730 --> 11:10.890
OF COURSE SHE IS.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.319
WHEN MAYA GOES
TO KINDERGARTEN.

11:12.430 --> 11:14.933
UH...

11:15.040 --> 11:18.237
WHY ARE YOU
HOLDING A MOUSETRAP ?

11:18.340 --> 11:19.932
I FOUND A BOX
OF THEM...

11:20.040 --> 11:22.304
REMEMBER WHEN WE HAD THAT
MOUSE INFESTATION YEARS AGO ?

11:22.410 --> 11:24.640
THOSE THINGS
ARE SO CRUEL.

11:24.750 --> 11:28.140
MICE HAVE GERMS,
THEY DESERVE TO DIE.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.282
* BECAUSE IT'S JUNE

11:31.390 --> 11:32.709
* JUNE, JUNE, JUNE, JUNE

11:32.820 --> 11:35.687
* JUST BECAUSE IT'S JUNE

11:35.790 --> 11:37.326
* JUNE

11:37.430 --> 11:39.318
* JUNE

11:39.430 --> 11:42.319
* JUNE, JUNE, JUNE

11:42.430 --> 11:44.796
* JUNE, JUNE

11:44.900 --> 11:47.437
* JUNE, JUNE, JUNE

11:47.540 --> 11:49.098
OKAY.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.339
WELL, LET'S JUST HOPE
THAT BAD REHEARSAL

11:51.440 --> 11:53.772
MEANS GOOD SHOW
TOMORROW NIGHT.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.201
GOODNIGHT,
EVERYBODY.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.170
DAVID ?

12:01.550 --> 12:04.110
WHAT, WAS
MY SOLO AWFUL ?

12:04.220 --> 12:05.084
NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:05.190 --> 12:06.179
IT'S, IT'S...

12:06.290 --> 12:07.552
IT'S GOOD.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.082
IT IS.

12:09.190 --> 12:11.579
BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO STOP
TRYING TO MAKE IT SO, UM...

12:11.690 --> 12:14.056
PERFECT.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.219
OH, OKAY.

12:16.330 --> 12:18.798
JUST TRY TO BE MORE
RELAXED WITH IT, OKAY ?

12:18.900 --> 12:23.462
OKAY, GREAT, WELL,
WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT.

12:24.810 --> 12:26.334
HEY, DAVID.

12:26.440 --> 12:27.600
WE'RE GOING OUT
FOR A DRINK.

12:27.710 --> 12:28.836
IT'S ONLY
GOING TO BE--

12:28.940 --> 12:32.501
A DRINK,
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

12:32.610 --> 12:35.147
DENNIS CAN KISS
MY LILY WHITE ASS.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.445
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
LIKE IT'S THE MET.

12:37.550 --> 12:39.108
HEY, HE'S JUST
TRYING TO...

12:39.220 --> 12:42.018
I MEAN, YOUR SOLO
IS A LITTLE...

12:42.120 --> 12:44.054
IT'S...

12:44.160 --> 12:45.320
WHAT ?

12:45.430 --> 12:46.579
IT'S PRISSY.

12:46.690 --> 12:49.864
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE
GIRL'S DOLL-HOUSE.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.824
LIKE A KITTY CAT
GREETING CARD.

12:51.930 --> 12:54.592
LIKE A POOFY WHITE
CUTESIE-PIE.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.292
THANKS, TERRY,
I GET THE POINT.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.402
GOD, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE IT SOUND...

12:58.510 --> 12:59.875
PRETTY.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.607
THAT'S THE POINT,
DEAR.

13:01.710 --> 13:02.938
DON'T.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.574
JUST SING FROM
SOMEPLACE REAL.

13:04.680 --> 13:08.138
( cheering )

13:08.250 --> 13:10.946
GOD, WHEN DID I BECOME
400 YEARS OLD ?

13:11.050 --> 13:13.484
ON YOUR LAST
BIRTH DAY.

13:13.590 --> 13:16.218
NOT THAT YOU WOULD REMEMBER
ANYTHING FROM THAT NIGHT.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.322
HE WAS ACTUALLY TRYING
TO CONVINCE THIS GUY

13:18.430 --> 13:20.853
THAT HE USED TO BE
IN CIRQUE DU SOLEIL.

13:20.960 --> 13:26.091
TER, SHOW HIM THE COMING DOWN
FROM A TRAPEZE LOOK, PLEASE.

13:31.470 --> 13:33.131
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.969
I'LL GET A CHECK
SO WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.538
THIS ONE IS OBSESSED
WITH "TRADING SPACES".

13:38.650 --> 13:41.471
WE'RE LUCKY
WE GOT HIM THIS LONG.

13:45.720 --> 13:49.554
LOOK, I KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO SAY ANYTHING, BUT I WILL.

13:49.660 --> 13:52.151
I FEEL WEIRD
NOT ACKNOWLEDGING IT.

13:52.260 --> 13:53.352
WHAT ?

13:53.460 --> 13:55.018
YOU KNOW--

13:56.000 --> 13:57.592
HOW WE KNOW
EACH OTHER.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.258
FROM CHORUS ?

13:59.370 --> 14:01.292
FINE, JUST PRETEND.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.765
WHATEVER.

14:02.870 --> 14:04.098
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.132
FROM THE BATHROOM
AT SEARS.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.470
IT WAS WHAT, SEVEN,
EIGHT YEARS AGO ?

14:08.580 --> 14:10.969
YOU JERKED ME OFF.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.877
THE SECOND STALL ?

14:12.980 --> 14:15.016
THE SECURITY GUY
ALMOST CAUGHT US ?

14:15.120 --> 14:18.112
I...

14:18.220 --> 14:21.417
HONESTLY, YOU'RE CONFUSING ME
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.782
OH, COME ON.

14:22.890 --> 14:24.357
YOU CHECKED ME OUT
IN AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIES,

14:24.460 --> 14:26.485
I FOLLOWED YOU
INTO HOME APPLIANCES,

14:26.590 --> 14:29.229
WE MET UP IN THE SECOND FLOOR
JOHN WHERE EVERYONE--

14:29.330 --> 14:30.365
THIS WASN'T ME.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.596
OH, PLEASE.

14:31.700 --> 14:35.261
FINE, BE THAT WAY.

14:38.470 --> 14:39.869
IS THAT ENOUGH ?

14:39.980 --> 14:41.231
DO YOU NEED MORE ?

14:41.340 --> 14:44.400
I THINK $40.00
IS TOO MUCH.

14:44.510 --> 14:47.616
SO, DAVID, IS YOUR BOYFRIEND
COMING TO THE CONCERT TOMORROW ?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.119
YEAH, HE'S SUPPOSED TO.

14:49.220 --> 14:52.417
I CAN'T WAIT
TO MEET HIM.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.848
GODDAMNIT.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.552
AREN'T THERE
INSTRUCTIONS ?

15:00.660 --> 15:05.097
A PAGE OF HIEROGLYPHICS SHOWING
NOTHING THAT CAME IN THIS BOX.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.965
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

15:09.070 --> 15:12.562
I'M CIRCLING PROBLEM PURCHASES
ON THE VISA BILL.

15:12.670 --> 15:15.036
PROBLEM PURCHASES ?

15:15.140 --> 15:18.143
THINGS WE BOUGHT
THAT MAYBE WE DIDN'T NEED

15:18.250 --> 15:21.344
OR COULD
BUY LESS OF.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.941
YOU MEAN
THINGS IOUGHT.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.814
WHAT ARE THESE
LITTLE SMILEY FACES ?

15:28.920 --> 15:30.182
GOOD PURCHASES ?

15:30.290 --> 15:32.326
NO, I WAS
JUST DOODLING.

15:32.430 --> 15:34.022
MMM.

15:34.130 --> 15:36.598
I DON'T SEE WHY THESE
ARE PROBLEM PURCHASES.

15:36.700 --> 15:37.667
THIS WAS LUNCH
WITH DAVID.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.362
I HAD TO EAT.

15:39.470 --> 15:41.438
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO SPEND $55.00.

15:41.540 --> 15:42.598
WHAT DID YOU HAVE ?

15:42.700 --> 15:44.008
A COUPLE OF
SANDWICHES.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.964
THIS COUNTRY
IS INSANE.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.674
WHAT ABOUT
THIS ONE ?

15:47.780 --> 15:49.338
YOU DROPPED $80.00
AT BOOK SOUP.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.670
I GUESS YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD OF LIBRARIES.

15:51.780 --> 15:53.372
LIBRARIES ARE
DEPRESSING.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.777
NATE.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.040
YOU'RE NOT
SINGLE ANYMORE.

15:56.150 --> 15:58.311
YOU CAN'T KEEP
SPENDING LIKE YOU ARE.

16:00.020 --> 16:04.423
OKAY, I'LL TRY
AND CUT DOWN.

16:04.530 --> 16:08.990
YOU KNOW, UNTIL
YOU GO BACK TO WORK.

16:11.600 --> 16:15.434
UM, ACTUALLY, I'M HOLDING OFF
LOOKING FOR ANOTHER JOB.

16:15.540 --> 16:16.859
REALLY ?

16:16.970 --> 16:18.562
FOR HOW LONG ?

16:18.670 --> 16:20.729
I DON'T KNOW,
WE'LL SEE.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.273
BECAUSE MY MOM SEEMS
TO THINK THAT

16:22.380 --> 16:25.178
IT'S UNTIL MAYA
STARTS KINDERGARTEN.

16:26.680 --> 16:30.684
THIS IS NOT A DECISION
YOU CAN MAKE WITHOUT ME.

16:32.490 --> 16:34.253
OKAY.

16:45.430 --> 16:46.226
HEY.

16:46.330 --> 16:47.968
THAT WAS
A LATE REHEARSAL.

16:48.070 --> 16:49.594
YEAH, WE JUST--

16:49.700 --> 16:52.032
YOU KNOW, THE CONCERT'S
TOMORROW NIGHT, SO...

16:52.140 --> 16:53.971
OH, WHAT TIME SHOULD
I BE THERE ?

16:54.080 --> 16:57.277
UH, 7:30.

16:57.380 --> 17:00.076
I DON'T GET OFF
UNTIL NINE AT THE EARLIEST.

17:00.180 --> 17:01.670
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ?

17:01.780 --> 17:04.442
DAVID, PLEASE DON'T TRY
AND MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY, OKAY ?

17:04.550 --> 17:06.848
I DID EVERYTHING I COULD
TO CHANGE MY SCHEDULE, BUT--

17:06.950 --> 17:08.315
I UNDERSTAND,
IT'S OKAY, REALLY.

17:08.420 --> 17:09.455
YOU'LL COME
TO THE NEXT ONE.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.357
BOY, JUST TWIST
THE KNIFE IN DEEPER.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.394
I'M GOING TO TALK
TO FRANK ABOUT THIS.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.695
KEITH, YOU REALLY
DON'T HAVE TO COME.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.665
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL,
I'M NOT ANGRY.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.295
REALLY ?

17:23.840 --> 17:25.102
THANK YOU...

17:25.210 --> 17:27.929
FOR BEING SO AWARE,
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

17:28.040 --> 17:32.079
WE REALLY ARE
MAKING PROGRESS.

17:36.650 --> 17:39.414
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
REALLY FUCKED UP.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.387
MISSING YOUR CONCERT
FOR THIS LAME-ASS JOB.

17:42.490 --> 17:44.651
I SHOULD JUST
CALL IN SICK.

17:44.760 --> 17:45.920
NO, DON'T.

17:46.030 --> 17:47.622
I DON'T GET IT.

17:47.730 --> 17:49.459
HOW DID MY LIFE BECOME
SO FUCKING MEANINGLESS ?

17:49.560 --> 17:50.959
I USED TO MAKE
A DIFFERENCE.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.334
I USED TO PROTECT
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.067
NOW, I JUST
PROTECT THEIR STUFF.

17:55.170 --> 17:56.489
WORK ISN'T
EVERYTHING.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.158
I GIVE YOU SOME MEANING,
DON'T I ?

17:58.270 --> 17:59.737
YOU GIVE ME MEANING.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.376
OF COURSE.

18:01.480 --> 18:04.142
BUT WE CAN'T BE EVERYTHING
FOR EACH OTHER, DAVID.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.741
I MEAN, THAT'S JUST
NOT POSSIBLE.

18:06.850 --> 18:10.684
( soft music )

18:26.130 --> 18:28.963
I'LL BE DONE
IN A FEW MINUTES, ARTHUR.

18:29.070 --> 18:30.708
YOU'RE A LITTLE EARLY.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.005
ACTUALLY,
I WAS A LOT EARLY.

18:33.110 --> 18:34.998
SO, I WALKED AROUND
THE BLOCK FOR A WHILE.

18:35.110 --> 18:39.240
AN ELDERLY WOMAN WHO WAS
ALMOST COMPLETELY BALD

18:39.350 --> 18:42.911
TOLD ME TO
GET OFF HER LAWN.

18:43.020 --> 18:44.988
MAY I ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION ?

18:45.090 --> 18:46.512
YOU CAN ASK.

18:46.620 --> 18:49.350
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE ME
OVER THE OTHER APPLICANTS ?

18:49.460 --> 18:51.655
I'M ONLY ASKING BECAUSE
I'M ALWAYS LOOKING TO IMPROVE

18:51.760 --> 18:53.523
MY INTERVIEW SKILLS.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.052
FAIR ENOUGH.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.765
IT WAS BETWEEN YOU
AND JUDY LINDAMAN,

18:57.870 --> 19:00.634
BUT WE JUST THOUGHT
YOU WOULD FIT HERE BETTER.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.402
BASED ON... ?

19:03.510 --> 19:04.807
WELL...

19:04.910 --> 19:08.801
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE WAY
YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR, UH...

19:08.910 --> 19:11.208
YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

19:11.310 --> 19:13.414
MY GREAT
AUNT PEARL.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.080
SHE WAS A VERY
SPECIAL WOMAN.

19:16.180 --> 19:18.182
I BARELY KNEW
MY PARENTS.

19:18.290 --> 19:21.214
THEY BURNED TO DEATH
IN A FIRE WHEN I WAS FIVE.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.151
OH, I'M SORRY.

19:23.260 --> 19:24.852
MY AUNT PEARL GAVE UP
EVERYTHING FOR ME.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.120
SHE HOME-SCHOOLED ME.

19:26.230 --> 19:27.424
YEAH.

19:27.530 --> 19:29.225
YEAH, YOU SEEM
A LITTLE...

19:29.330 --> 19:31.924
HOME-SCHOOLED.

19:34.970 --> 19:37.234
AH, SHIT.

19:37.340 --> 19:39.865
THESE COLLAGEN LIPS
ARE SUCH A BITCH.

19:39.970 --> 19:44.805
I'M GUESSING YOUR AUNT PEARL
DIDN'T LIKE CUSSING, HUH ?

19:44.910 --> 19:47.447
NOT ONE BIT.

19:47.550 --> 19:49.973
SHE WOULD HAVE TARRED ME
FOR THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.945
RICO, HAVE YOU...

19:52.050 --> 19:53.312
OH, MRS. F.

19:53.420 --> 19:55.684
THIS IS ARTHUR MARTIN,
OUR NEW APPRENTICE.

19:55.790 --> 19:56.779
HELLO.

19:56.890 --> 19:58.721
EXCUSE ME,
HAVE YOU SEEN NATE ?

19:58.830 --> 20:00.695
LISA'S LOOKING
FOR HIM.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.504
THAT'LL BE $62.90.

20:10.610 --> 20:13.374
THERE YOU GO.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.240
( beep)

20:17.350 --> 20:19.341
OH, I HAVE TO TALK
TO MY MANAGER.

20:19.450 --> 20:22.214
I NEED
CREDIT APPROVAL !

20:22.320 --> 20:24.538
THIS CD IS
SO GREAT FOR LIKE,

20:24.650 --> 20:28.814
TAKING DIET PILLS
AND CLEANING YOUR BATHROOM.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.790
WHAT ARE YOU DOING... ?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.094
UH--

20:36.200 --> 20:37.519
DO YOU EVEN LISTEN
TO ME WHEN I TALK ?

20:37.630 --> 20:39.393
OR DO YOU JUST HEAR STATIC
EVERY TIME I OPEN MY MOUTH ?

20:39.500 --> 20:41.434
HOW ON EARTH DO YOU EXPECT
MAYA TO GO TO COLLEGE ?

20:41.540 --> 20:43.929
YOU'RE THROWING EVERYTHING
WE HAVE TOGETHER

20:44.040 --> 20:46.258
AWAY FOR FUCKING BECK ?

20:47.380 --> 20:49.735
JUST SIGN HERE,
PLEASE.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.341
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

20:51.450 --> 20:53.475
I DON'T WANT THESE,
I CHANGED MY MIND.

20:53.580 --> 20:57.710
SO, CAN WE JUST
CANCEL THIS PURCHASE ?

21:32.250 --> 21:36.186
COME ON, CLAIRE, THE EARLY WORM
CATCHES THINGS, LET'S GO.

21:36.290 --> 21:39.225
OKAY, WHERE'S
YOUR STUDIO ?

21:39.330 --> 21:40.251
IN MY HOUSE.

21:40.360 --> 21:41.429
WHY IS THAT
YOUR BUSINESS ?

21:41.530 --> 21:43.725
ISN'T THAT WHERE
WE'RE GOING ?

21:43.830 --> 21:44.797
NO.

21:44.900 --> 21:46.720
WE'RE GOING TO
THE CENTURY CITY MALL.

21:46.830 --> 21:47.592
THE MALL ?

21:47.700 --> 21:49.395
BEST MALL
IN THE WORLD.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.728
I USED TO LIKE LIVINGSTON MALL
WHEN I TAUGHT AT RUTGERS.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.467
BUT THEN BAMBERGERS
WENT OUT OF BUSINESS

21:52.570 --> 21:54.606
AND IT ALL WENT
STRAIGHT TO HELL.

21:54.710 --> 21:55.608
WAIT.

21:55.710 --> 21:58.201
YOU NEED AN ASSISTANT
TO SHOP ?

21:58.310 --> 22:01.040
I NEED AN ASSISTANT
TO DRIVE ME.

22:01.150 --> 22:03.482
MY LICENSE WAS TAKEN AWAY
BY A JACK-BOOTED FASCIST.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.615
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I AM ALWAYS PERSECUTED,

22:05.720 --> 22:07.244
BUT IT HAS
ALWAYS BEEN SO.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.918
SO...

22:09.020 --> 22:10.317
I'M YOUR DRIVER ?

22:10.430 --> 22:12.227
YES, CAN WE GO NOW ?

22:12.330 --> 22:13.957
BRENTANO'S IS
HAVING A SALE.

22:14.060 --> 22:15.891
AND IF I EVER CATCH YOU
WITH MY TOOTHBRUSH AGAIN,

22:16.000 --> 22:17.968
YOU'RE DEAD MEAT.

22:27.710 --> 22:30.076
THIS IS MY BROTHER,
NATE.

22:30.180 --> 22:32.171
NATE, THIS IS
TOM JAFFE.

22:32.280 --> 22:34.145
WILLIAM JAFFE'S SON.

22:34.250 --> 22:36.218
OH, I DIDN'T
REALIZE HE HAD A...

22:36.320 --> 22:38.311
LOOK, I'M SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

22:38.420 --> 22:40.217
I WAS ONLY
A FEW MONTHS OLD WHEN HE...

22:40.320 --> 22:43.016
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.520
I NEVER EVEN
KNEW HIM.

22:45.630 --> 22:48.997
TOM WAS JUST DROPPING OFF
SOME OF HIS FATHER'S BELONGINGS.

22:49.100 --> 22:51.523
IT SEEMS KIND
OF STRANGE

22:51.630 --> 22:53.598
CONSIDERING THAT
THERE'S NO REAL BODY.

22:53.700 --> 22:55.292
WELL, IN SITUATIONS
LIKE YOUR FATHER'S,

22:55.400 --> 22:57.265
WE FIND IT HELPS
THE FAMILY TO PUT

22:57.370 --> 22:59.429
SOME OF HIS BELONGINGS
TO REST ALSO.

22:59.540 --> 23:02.600
WELL, I HOPE
THIS'LL DO.

23:05.210 --> 23:09.146
WAS YOUR FATHER
A LITTLE PERSON ?

23:09.250 --> 23:13.118
NO, THIS WAS THE ONLY SUIT
OF HIS MY MOTHER COULD FIND.

23:13.220 --> 23:16.087
IT WAS IN SOME BOX
HIS FAMILY HAD.

23:16.190 --> 23:18.226
IT'S FROM HIS
BAR MITZVAH.

23:18.330 --> 23:21.049
OH, AND THERE'S THIS.

23:21.160 --> 23:22.593
IT WAS
IN THE SAME BOX.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.122
IT EITHER BELONGED
TO HIM OR MY UNCLE.

23:24.230 --> 23:28.929
MY MOTHER THINKS SHE REMEMBERS
MY FATHER LIKING "BLUE BAYOU".

23:33.070 --> 23:36.608
WELL, I'M GOING TO GET FIRED
IF I'M NOT BACK BY TWO.

23:36.710 --> 23:39.178
SO, IF THAT'S ALL... ?

23:39.280 --> 23:43.944
YES, WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
AFTERNOON AT THE FUNERAL.

23:46.350 --> 23:47.715
THAN KS.

23:50.690 --> 23:53.727
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU ?

23:56.130 --> 23:59.019
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING SO CALM
ABOUT YOUR FATHER'S DEATH ?

23:59.130 --> 24:01.894
WELL, HE PROBABLY THINKS OF HIS
STEP-FATHER AS HIS REAL FATHER.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.297
AS HE SHOULD.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.061
HE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIS DAD.

24:05.170 --> 24:06.467
NOT A THING.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.629
HE HAS NO IDEA WHETHER
HE EVEN LIKED LINDA RONSTADT.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.538
DO YOU KNOW IF OUR DAD
LIKED LINDA RONSTADT ?

24:11.650 --> 24:13.470
AS A MATTER
OF FACT I DO.

24:13.580 --> 24:16.572
WHEN I CLEANED OUT
HIS RECORD COLLECTION,

24:16.680 --> 24:19.740
THERE WAS A COPY OF
"HEART LIKE A WHEEL" IN IT.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.724
HERE ARE
THE TEACUPS.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.388
AND THESE
ARE DINNER PLATES.

24:25.490 --> 24:27.253
AND THOSE UP THERE
ARE FOR CASSEROLES.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.658
AND THESE ARE
THE CEREAL BOWLS.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.422
PLEASE FEEL FREE
TO USE ANY OF THE DISHES.

24:32.530 --> 24:35.363
IS THERE ONE
I SHOULDN'T USE ?

24:35.470 --> 24:37.506
IT'S SILLY.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.362
THAT ONE USED TO BE
DAVID'S SPECIAL YELLOW BOWL.

24:39.470 --> 24:41.301
HE WOULD GET UPSET
WHEN ANYONE ELSE USED IT.

24:41.410 --> 24:43.776
BUT I'M SURE
HE WON'T MIND ANYMORE.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.677
LET'S NOT
TAKE THE CHANCE.

24:45.780 --> 24:47.873
WE'LL KEEP IT
OUT OF ROTATION.

24:47.980 --> 24:49.311
THANK YOU.

24:49.420 --> 24:52.583
NOW, YOU SEE
THE CHART I MADE ?

24:52.690 --> 24:55.215
EACH MEAL TIME IS
DIVIDED INTO TWO SHIFTS.

24:55.320 --> 24:56.548
ONE FOR EACH OF US.

24:56.660 --> 24:58.628
SO, WE NEVER HAVE
TO SUFFER THE AWKWARDNESS

24:58.730 --> 25:01.028
OF BOTH EATING
AT THE SAME TIME.

25:01.130 --> 25:02.154
THANK YOU.

25:02.260 --> 25:03.454
THAT'S VERY
THOUGHTFUL.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.322
WE JUST SIGN UP EACH DAY
FOR THE ONE WE WANT.

25:05.430 --> 25:08.661
SO, MY DINNER CAN
BE FROM SIX TO SEVEN.

25:08.770 --> 25:11.136
OR FROM
SEVEN TO EIGHT.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.434
EXACTLY.

25:12.540 --> 25:13.973
WHICH DO YOU
WANT TONIGHT ?

25:14.080 --> 25:16.105
I'LL TAKE SEVEN.

25:16.210 --> 25:19.043
ACTUALLY,

25:19.150 --> 25:22.176
I'LL TAKE SIX.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.986
OH GOOD, I HAD
A LATE LUNCH.

25:24.090 --> 25:26.240
JUST USE THAT PEN THERE
TO INITIAL IT.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.386
OF COURSE, OTHER PEOPLE
IN THIS HOUSE

25:28.490 --> 25:30.412
OBVIOUSLY ALSO
USE THE KITCHEN.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.659
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE
A SCHEDULE WITH THEM TOO,

25:32.760 --> 25:34.318
FEEL FREE
TO USE MY SYSTEM.

25:34.430 --> 25:36.921
LAUNDRY FACILITIES
ARE IN HERE.

25:37.030 --> 25:40.761
NOW, SUNDAY NIGHTS
ARE OFF LIMITS TO YOU.

25:40.870 --> 25:43.031
I'M VERY SORRY, BUT THAT'S
WHEN I DO MY LINENS.

25:43.140 --> 25:44.266
YES, MA'AM.

25:44.370 --> 25:46.509
I UNDERSTAND
COMPLETELY.

25:46.610 --> 25:48.771
I SHOULD WRITE
DOWN THAT PART

25:48.880 --> 25:51.769
ABOUT NEVER AIMING THE SHOWER
HEAD AT THAT PART OF THE TILE...

25:51.880 --> 25:53.108
NO NEED.

25:53.210 --> 25:54.973
IT'S ALL IN THE LITTLE BKLET
THAT'S HANGING BY THE SINK.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.638
WHAT A LOVELY ROOM.

25:56.750 --> 25:59.048
SUCH WARM LIGHT.

25:59.150 --> 26:00.651
IT DOES THE TRICK.

26:00.760 --> 26:06.187
"THE SECOND DRAWER STICKS
UNLESS YOU LII-T AS YOU PULL."

26:11.630 --> 26:13.291
THANK YOU.

26:13.400 --> 26:16.039
THAT'S VERY KIND.

26:16.140 --> 26:19.303
ALRIGHT THEN.

26:19.410 --> 26:21.401
THAT'S THE END
OF THE TOUR.

26:21.510 --> 26:23.944
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN NOW.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.006
THANK YOU.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.901
( door closing )

27:00.150 --> 27:02.209
NATE ?

27:05.690 --> 27:08.011
OH, MY GOD.

27:10.660 --> 27:11.922
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

27:12.030 --> 27:13.554
I SHOULD HAVE
CALLED FIRST.

27:13.660 --> 27:15.855
I WAS AFRAID
YOU WOULD...

27:15.960 --> 27:19.726
I NEED TO
TALK TO YOU.

27:19.830 --> 27:23.334
IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

27:25.110 --> 27:28.932
I WOULDN'T ASK YOU
IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT...

27:29.810 --> 27:31.004
I DON'T KNOW.

27:31.110 --> 27:32.748
I'VE GOT A LOT OF ERRANDS
I HAVE TO RUN TODAY.

27:32.850 --> 27:37.275
UH, CAN I
COME WITH YOU ?

27:39.550 --> 27:41.654
PLEASE ?

27:46.390 --> 27:50.121
IT SEEMS LIKE I JUST GOT THIS
THING SMOG CHECKED LAST MONTH.

27:57.400 --> 28:00.403
YOU KNOW, I CALLED YOU WHEN
I FIRST GOT BACK INTO TOWN...

28:00.510 --> 28:02.375
A COUPLE OF
MONTHS AGO ?

28:02.480 --> 28:04.971
AND I HUNG UP
WHEN YOU ANSWERED.

28:05.080 --> 28:10.712
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU WERE ALIVE.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.415
I'M SORRY,
IT'S JUST...

28:14.520 --> 28:16.112
AI-TER EVERYTHING
WE WENT THROUGH,

28:16.220 --> 28:18.450
TO NOT EVEN KNOW
IF YOU'RE ALIVE ?

28:18.560 --> 28:20.152
THAT'S...

28:20.260 --> 28:22.421
SAD.

28:23.900 --> 28:28.234
BUT APPARENTLY YOUR SURGERY
WAS A SUCCESS, RIGHT ?

28:28.340 --> 28:29.329
YEAH.

28:29.440 --> 28:34.036
WELL, THE A.V.M. RUPTURED
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT,

28:34.140 --> 28:36.233
AND ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE,
BUT THEY...

28:36.340 --> 28:38.205
FIXED IT.

28:38.310 --> 28:40.278
OH, THANK GOD.

28:42.780 --> 28:44.611
USE YOUR FUCKING
SIGNAL, WOMAN !

28:44.720 --> 28:47.848
YOU CAN
GO UP MY ASS !

28:48.820 --> 28:52.028
( radio playing )

28:54.030 --> 28:55.292
CLAIRE,

28:55.400 --> 28:59.769
I ONCE HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH AN OLDER MARRIED WOMAN.

28:59.870 --> 29:02.464
HER NAME WAS ASTRA.

29:02.570 --> 29:05.767
THAT MEANS STAR,
DID YOU KNOW THAT ?

29:07.670 --> 29:10.036
HAVE YOU EVER
COMMITTED INFIDELITY ?

29:10.140 --> 29:12.040
NO, NOT YET.

29:12.150 --> 29:15.119
BUT SOMEDAY,
HOPEFULLY.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.642
INFIDELITY IS
NOT FUNNY, CLAIRE.

29:16.750 --> 29:17.910
IT'S TRAGIC.

29:18.020 --> 29:19.715
ALL BETRAYAL
IS TRAGIC.

29:19.820 --> 29:23.312
I WAS 21 WHEN
WE FIRST MET.

29:23.420 --> 29:27.550
THE RADIO WAS PLAYING
"I WEAR MY SUNGLASSES AT NIGHT".

29:27.660 --> 29:31.460
SUCH AN INSIPID SONG,

29:33.370 --> 29:36.066
BUT NOW IT ALWAYS
MAKES MY HEART FEEL...

29:36.170 --> 29:39.765
SQUISHED.

29:43.010 --> 29:45.274
AW, SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

29:45.380 --> 29:46.506
YEAH...

29:46.610 --> 29:50.842
SHE'S THE BEST FUCKING THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

29:54.090 --> 29:56.513
SO, WHAT'S GOING
ON WITH YOU ?

29:56.620 --> 29:58.554
OH...

29:58.660 --> 30:01.595
I WENT TO SANTA FE
FOR A WHILE.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.066
I WAS IN
AUSTIN, TEXAS.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.889
A COUPLE OF WEEKS IN TAHOE,
BUT I JUST REALLY HATED IT.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.592
WHAT WERE
YOU DOING THERE ?

30:08.700 --> 30:12.534
JUST TRYING TO FIND A PLACE
THAT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.629
ARE YOU STILL
LIVING IN VENICE ?

30:17.740 --> 30:20.243
I'M STAYING AT
MY MOM'S RIGHT NOW.

30:20.350 --> 30:22.409
AND HOW'S THAT ?

30:22.520 --> 30:26.445
IT'S THE HARDEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE.

30:26.550 --> 30:27.687
OKAY.

30:27.790 --> 30:31.385
BAD NEWS,
YOUR CAR DIDN'T PASS.

30:31.490 --> 30:32.855
I CAN FIX IT.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.188
BUT I'LL NEED
ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.029
ALRIGHT.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.663
WELL, THAT TOTALLY
FUCKS UP MY AFTERNOON.

30:39.770 --> 30:41.567
YOU KNOW, I SAW
A PLACE UP THE STREET,

30:41.670 --> 30:43.490
WE COULD GET A DRINK.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.763
SO, WHAT'S
YOUR LIFE LIKE ?

30:46.870 --> 30:49.703
BEING MARRIED,
BEING A FATHER... ?

30:49.810 --> 30:51.675
IT'S GREAT.

30:51.780 --> 30:54.374
IT'S REALLY GREAT.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.742
I'M GLAD.

30:55.850 --> 30:58.546
YOU SO DESERVE
TO BE HAPPY,

30:58.650 --> 31:01.153
AFTER EVERYTHING
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.483
I MEAN IT'S
HARD SOMETIMES.

31:04.590 --> 31:06.581
YOU KNOW...

31:06.690 --> 31:08.555
RELATIONSHIPS
AREN'T EASY.

31:08.660 --> 31:10.525
REALLY.

31:13.170 --> 31:16.162
YOU JUST HAVE TO
WORK AT IT EVERY DAY.

31:16.270 --> 31:20.161
YOU CAN'T EXPECT EVERYTHING
TO BE PERFECT ALL THE TIME,

31:20.270 --> 31:24.240
AND YOU CAN'T GET SHAKEN
WHEN IT ISN'T.

31:24.350 --> 31:27.706
IF THERE'S A MOMENT WHEN
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN PRISON,

31:27.810 --> 31:30.711
I JUST HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT ALL THOSE MOMENTS

31:30.820 --> 31:32.185
WHEN IT FEELS SAFE.

31:32.290 --> 31:35.657
AND REMIND MYSELF
THAT THOSE MOMENTS

31:35.760 --> 31:37.614
OUTWEIGH THE PRISON
MOMENTS.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.654
BEING ALONE
IS THE PRISON.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.489
JUST THINKING
ABOUT YOURSELF.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.056
JUST BEING TRAPPED
IN THIS FUCKING VORTEX

31:43.160 --> 31:45.469
OF ALWAYS
WATCHING YOURSELF.

31:45.570 --> 31:48.459
WHICH I SUPPOSE IS OKAY
IF YOU'RE INTERESTING.

31:48.570 --> 31:53.974
THE TRUTH IS,
NOBODY'S THAT INTERESTING.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.832
OH GOD,
LISTEN TO ME.

31:55.940 --> 31:57.908
LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT
MOVIES OR SOMETHING.

31:58.010 --> 31:59.648
SORRY, I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN
A MOVIE IN LIKE A YEAR.

31:59.750 --> 32:02.378
ANYTHING ELSE ?

32:02.480 --> 32:05.017
NO.

32:06.850 --> 32:09.318
JUST THE CHECK.

32:10.790 --> 32:14.453
FUCK.

32:14.560 --> 32:17.028
SO BREN, WHAT'S THIS LITTLE
CATCHING UP SESSION ALL ABOUT ?

32:17.130 --> 32:19.769
I'M NOT SURE.

32:19.870 --> 32:24.569
ACTUALLY,
I AM SURE.

32:27.870 --> 32:31.374
THIS IS
SO DIFFICULT. ..

32:33.610 --> 32:34.975
I APOLOGIZE...

32:35.080 --> 32:37.548
FOR HAVING SEX
WITH OTHER PEOPLE

32:37.650 --> 32:40.118
WHILE BEING IN A COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.

32:40.220 --> 32:42.654
FOR NOT SHOWING UP
TO OUR SHARED REALITY

32:42.760 --> 32:46.526
BY ALTERING MY CONSCIOUSNESS
WITH VARIOUS SUBSTANCES.

32:46.630 --> 32:48.951
BUT YOU ALREADY
APOLOGIZED--

32:51.000 --> 32:52.763
OH, YOU'RE
MAKING AMENDS.

32:52.870 --> 32:55.998
I HATE THAT WORD.

32:56.100 --> 32:59.206
YOU'RE STILL DOING
THE WHOLE 12-STEP THING ?

32:59.310 --> 33:00.800
I'M DOING A LOT OF
DIFFERENT THINGS.

33:00.910 --> 33:03.834
MY LIFE IS...

33:03.940 --> 33:07.307
COMPLICATED RIGHT NOW.

33:07.410 --> 33:11.414
YEAH, WELL,
WHOSE ISN'T ?

33:13.620 --> 33:14.848
NO, NO, NO,
LET ME.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.211
OH.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.584
THAN KS.

33:23.630 --> 33:26.269
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF SHE'S ALIVE NOW.

33:26.370 --> 33:29.134
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
BEFORE I MET ASTRA

33:29.240 --> 33:33.108
I WAS CONSUMED BY
THIS PASSION TO CREATE,

33:33.210 --> 33:37.704
A PASSION I SEEM
TO HAVE LOST.

33:40.580 --> 33:43.811
I WAS NEVER REALLY
IN LOVE WITH HER, YOU KNOW ?

33:43.920 --> 33:46.286
OF COURSE
YOU WERE.

33:46.390 --> 33:49.553
YOU RIPPED A JASMINE BUSH
OUT OF THE GROUND FOR HER

33:49.660 --> 33:51.389
AND PUT IT
IN HER CAR.

33:51.490 --> 33:53.185
NO, NO, NO.

33:53.290 --> 33:55.554
I HAD JUST HAD
MY FIRST REAL SUCCESS,

33:55.660 --> 33:58.390
AND ALL EYES WERE ON ME,
WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO NEXT ?

33:58.500 --> 34:00.195
I WAS A COWARD.

34:00.300 --> 34:02.894
I FOCUSED ON
ANOTHER PERSON.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.503
I COULD HAVE
BEEN GREAT.

34:05.610 --> 34:10.377
AND SO CAN YOU.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.778
IF YOU GET LONELY,
HAVE SEX.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.519
BUT IF YOU MEET SOMEBODY WHO YOU
THINK MEANS SOMETHING TO YOU,

34:15.620 --> 34:18.589
YOU'RE DOOMED.

34:26.730 --> 34:31.463
( rap music)

34:45.880 --> 34:50.214
( male on security radio )
Car 438, Car 438,
do you receive me ?

34:50.320 --> 34:53.847
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

34:53.950 --> 34:56.680
Alarm going off
at 5636 Fremont Place.

34:56.790 --> 35:00.453
GOT IT,
I'M ON MY WAY.

35:27.120 --> 35:32.183
( radio chatter)

35:40.870 --> 35:42.633
YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.332
INSIDER JOB.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.101
MUST'VE KNOWN
THE OWNERS WERE AWAY.

35:46.210 --> 35:47.438
WENT STRAIGHT FOR
THE JEWELRY UPSTAIRS

35:47.540 --> 35:49.132
AND THE CASHBOX
IN THE LIBRARY.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.640
REAL NEAT AND CLEAN.

35:55.450 --> 35:57.975
YOU BOYS SURE YOU'RE GOING TO BE
OKAY CLOSING UP BY YOURSELVES ?

35:58.080 --> 35:59.115
YEAH.

35:59.220 --> 36:00.710
I THINK
WE CAN HANDLE IT.

36:00.820 --> 36:03.459
( laughing )

36:03.560 --> 36:05.050
FUCKING COPS.

36:05.160 --> 36:08.527
THINK THEY'RE
SUCH HOT SHIT.

36:09.700 --> 36:10.655
HEY.

36:10.760 --> 36:11.897
DION CORELLI.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.729
KEITH CHARLES.

36:13.830 --> 36:15.695
YOU WERE HOPING FOR
SOME ACTION, RIGHT ?

36:15.800 --> 36:18.803
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.366
I KNOW
THAT FEELING.

36:20.470 --> 36:24.270
HEY, HOW ABOUT
I BUY YOU A DRINK ?

36:26.110 --> 36:30.911
* STARTED OUT
LIKE A SONG *

36:31.020 --> 36:39.257
* IT STARTED QUIET AND SLOW
WITH NO SURPRISE *

36:39.360 --> 36:45.390
* AND THEN ONE MORNING
I WOKE TO REALIZE *

36:45.500 --> 36:52.429
* WE HAD A GOOD
THING GOING *

36:54.170 --> 36:58.675
* IT'S NOT THAT
NOTHING WENT WRONG *

36:58.780 --> 37:00.441
* WENT WRONG

37:00.550 --> 37:06.546
* SOME ANGRY MOMENTS OF COURSE,
BUT JUST A FEW *

37:06.650 --> 37:13.226
* AND ONLY MOMENTS NO MORE,
BECAUSE WE KNEW *

37:13.330 --> 37:19.496
* WE HAD THIS
GOOD THING GOING *

37:19.600 --> 37:25.038
* AND IF I WANT IT TOO MUCH
WAS THAT SUCH A MISTAKE *

37:25.140 --> 37:28.166
* A MISTAKE
AT THE TIME *

37:28.280 --> 37:35.618
* YOU NEVER
WANTED ENOUGH... *

37:35.720 --> 37:38.177
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S COMFORTABLE ?

37:38.290 --> 37:40.087
I DON'T KNOW WHEN
I GOT SO CLUMSY.

37:40.190 --> 37:42.385
I NEVER USED
TO BE THIS WAY.

37:42.490 --> 37:45.220
I THINK
IT'S TOO TIGHT.

37:45.330 --> 37:47.286
NO, IT'S FINE,
REALLY.

37:47.390 --> 37:51.053
IT WAS SO STRANGE I PUT
MY FINGER RIGHT ON THAT NAIL

37:51.160 --> 37:52.923
WHEN I HEARD YOU
COMING UP THE STAIRS.

37:53.030 --> 37:55.965
I MEAN, I'D SEEN IT STICKING
OUT OF THE WALL, BUT...

37:56.070 --> 37:57.469
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT IT ?

37:57.570 --> 37:58.764
I WOULD HAVE
FIXED IT.

37:58.870 --> 38:01.805
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE
SOMEBODY PUSHED ME.

38:01.910 --> 38:06.074
LIKE SOME KIND OF INVISIBLE
PERSON WANTED TO HURT ME.

38:06.180 --> 38:09.149
AND EARLIER
IN THE DAY,

38:09.250 --> 38:11.309
I TWISTED MY ANKLE
COMING DOWN THE STAIRS ?

38:11.420 --> 38:13.888
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU,
FOR SOMETHING.

38:13.990 --> 38:16.049
IT WAS AROUND FOUR.

38:16.160 --> 38:18.014
I COULDN'T
FIND YOU ANYWHERE.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.725
I WENT OUT
FOR A DRINK.

38:22.130 --> 38:24.155
WITH BRENDA.

38:24.260 --> 38:26.626
WHY ?

38:26.730 --> 38:30.837
SHE JUST SHOWED UP,
I WAS RUNNING SOME ERRANDS,

38:30.940 --> 38:32.100
SHE CAME ALONG.

38:32.210 --> 38:34.599
GETTING A DRINK
IS AN ERRAND ?

38:39.880 --> 38:41.575
WHAT DID SHE WANT ?

38:41.680 --> 38:44.547
TO APOLOGIZE FOR BEING
SUCH A CRAZY BITCH

38:44.650 --> 38:46.538
WHEN WE WERE
TOGETHER.

38:51.290 --> 38:54.657
ACTUALLY, IT WAS
PRETTY DECENT OF HER.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.159
WHAT ?

38:56.260 --> 38:58.251
LISA, IT WAS
JUST ONE BEER.

38:58.370 --> 39:00.258
YEAH, WELL, I REALLY
DON'T APPRECIATE FINDING OUT

39:00.370 --> 39:01.769
ABOUT IT
AFTER THE FACT.

39:01.870 --> 39:03.462
IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
BUT NEXT TIME,

39:03.570 --> 39:04.832
IF SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPENS,

39:04.940 --> 39:06.601
PLEASE, TELL ME FIRST
BEFORE YOU GO DO IT.

39:06.710 --> 39:08.530
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO,
COME ASK PERMISSION ?

39:08.640 --> 39:10.107
NO, BUT YOU COULD
HAVE SAID,

39:10.210 --> 39:12.075
"HEY, I WANT YOU TO MEET
MY WIFE," THEN INTRODUCED ME,

39:12.180 --> 39:15.672
AND SAID YOU WERE GONNA GO
CATCH UP WITH AN OLD GIRLFRIEND.

39:19.920 --> 39:22.115
YOU'RE RIGHT.

39:22.220 --> 39:24.859
I'M SORRY.

39:29.360 --> 39:31.920
RELAX, GUY, THE OWNERS
ARE IN ANTIGUA.

39:32.030 --> 39:33.292
THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO MIND.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.163
WE SHOULDN'T
BE DOING THIS.

39:35.270 --> 39:37.568
COME ON,
YOU DESERVE IT.

39:37.670 --> 39:40.207
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE GOING TO GET CAUGHT.

39:40.310 --> 39:43.837
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
WHO WOULD CATCH US.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.044
THIS IS SOME PLACE.

39:54.150 --> 39:55.515
YEAH.

39:55.620 --> 39:57.713
I BET THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE
DON'T EVEN APPRECIATE IT.

39:57.820 --> 39:59.378
PROBABLY NOT.

39:59.490 --> 40:01.890
NO ONE APPRECIATES
WHAT THEY HAVE.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.991
ESPECIALLY THE ONES
WHO HAVE MORE OF IT.

40:04.100 --> 40:07.160
FUCKING RICH PEOPLE.

40:07.270 --> 40:09.431
WHAT CAN YOU DO ?

40:09.540 --> 40:13.408
DON'T YOU EVER
JUST WANT TO--

40:18.080 --> 40:19.274
( laughing )

40:19.380 --> 40:21.814
THAT FELT SO GOOD.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.825
YEAH.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.650
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING, MAN ?

40:37.760 --> 40:39.125
LET'S FUCK
THIS PLACE UP.

40:39.230 --> 40:41.539
COME ON, THOSE IDIOT COPS
DIDN'T EVEN CHECK IN HERE.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.596
WE'LL GO TO TOWN
AND SAY THE ROBBERS DID IT.

40:43.700 --> 40:45.804
LET'S JUST
BREAK SOME SHIT !

40:45.910 --> 40:48.265
TEACH THOSE GREEDY
RICH FUCKERS A LESSON.

40:48.370 --> 40:49.576
YOU'RE CRAZY.

40:49.680 --> 40:53.104
COME ON GUY,
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

40:57.620 --> 41:00.748
HEY, CUT IT OUT !

41:02.660 --> 41:06.050
CUT IT OUT,
CUT IT OUT !

41:06.160 --> 41:09.823
OKAY, OKAY,
OKAY, OKAY !

41:09.930 --> 41:11.921
JESUS !

41:25.080 --> 41:28.243
YOU DID A GREAT JOB
TONIGHT, DAVID.

41:28.350 --> 41:30.272
YOU WERE AMAZING.

41:30.380 --> 41:32.541
DENNIS, CAN I BORROW YOU
FOR FIVE SECONDS ?

41:32.650 --> 41:35.357
THIS IS THE PART
WHERE PATRICK MAKES ME

41:35.460 --> 41:37.485
GO OVER EVERY
SYLLABLE HE SANG,

41:37.590 --> 41:41.151
DESCRIBING WHY EACH WAS
SO UNIQUE AND WONDERFUL.

41:41.260 --> 41:43.558
( laughing )

42:00.480 --> 42:01.572
HEY, TERRY.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.272
WHERE'S
YOUR BOYFRIEND ?

42:03.380 --> 42:06.383
HE HAD TO WORK.

42:06.490 --> 42:08.310
OKAY, IT WAS ME.

42:08.420 --> 42:10.456
IN THE SEARS BATHROOM,
YOU KNOW ?

42:10.560 --> 42:13.028
HONEY, I KNOW
IT WAS YOU.

42:13.130 --> 42:14.893
I NEVER FORGET A...

42:15.000 --> 42:16.297
FACE.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.049
GOD, IT FEELS
SO GOOD JUST TO SAY IT.

42:18.160 --> 42:20.321
I DON'T KNOW WHY I WOULDN'T
JUST ADMIT IT YESTERDAY.

42:20.430 --> 42:21.590
IT JUST SEEMED SO...

42:21.700 --> 42:23.736
SLEAZY, REPRESSED,
NOT THAT PRETTY ?

42:23.840 --> 42:26.559
YEAH, SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

42:27.610 --> 42:30.238
THAT TIME FOR ME
WAS SO DIFFICULT.

42:30.340 --> 42:33.503
I MEAN,
REALLY DIFFICU LT.

42:33.610 --> 42:37.376
I TRIED SO HARD
TO COMPARTMENTALIZE

42:37.480 --> 42:39.619
THAT PART OF MY LIFE,
BUT YOU CAN'T--

42:39.720 --> 42:44.384
SWEETIE, YOU DON'T NEED
TO EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

42:44.490 --> 42:47.721
I DON'T KNOW WHY THINGS SHOULD
HAVE TO BE SO HARD FOR PEOPLE.

42:47.830 --> 42:50.492
I GUESS BECAUSE
WE MAKE THEM THAT WAY.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.488
SO...

42:52.600 --> 42:55.296
YOU EVER JERK OFF
ANYONE ELSE IN THE CHORUS ?

42:55.400 --> 42:57.129
OF COURSE NOT.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.367
YOU ?

42:59.470 --> 43:02.337
A COUPLE.

43:04.080 --> 43:07.504
SO, IF I LET YOU UP,
NO MORE CRAZY STUFF ?

43:07.610 --> 43:10.716
NO, SIR.

43:18.760 --> 43:22.298
HOLY SHIT, MAN,

43:22.400 --> 43:27.360
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO PLAY SO HARD.

43:27.470 --> 43:31.668
I WAS JUST BLOWING OFF
A LITTLE STEAM.

43:31.770 --> 43:35.809
GET YOUR THINGS
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

43:39.050 --> 43:40.847
YOU EVER A COP ?

43:42.350 --> 43:44.238
NO.

43:46.890 --> 43:49.518
WELL, WHATEVER YOU ARE,

43:49.620 --> 43:53.829
YOU GOT A LOT OF SHIT
TO DEAL WITH.

44:23.620 --> 44:26.987
I COULD ALWAYS TALK TO WILL
BECAUSE HE WAS MY BEST BUDDY.

44:27.090 --> 44:30.355
SO, MY WIFE SAID WHY DON'T
YOU PRETEND THAT HE'S HERE ?

44:30.460 --> 44:32.291
WHAT WOULD
YOTELL HIM ?

44:32.400 --> 44:35.164
SO, I THOUGHT WHAT THE HELL,
I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

44:35.270 --> 44:38.091
SO, I SAY,

44:38.200 --> 44:40.236
GODDAMN YOU, WILL,
I'M MAD AT YOU.

44:40.340 --> 44:43.275
YOU'RE NOT GETTING BALD
AND BEFUDDLED AND FLABBY

44:43.380 --> 44:46.304
LIKE THE REST OF US
OLD TIRED MARRIED FOLK.

44:46.410 --> 44:49.140
YOU HAD THE RIGHT IDEA,
THOUGH.

44:49.250 --> 44:52.219
CUT OUT WHILE YOU WERE
IN YOUR PRIME.

44:55.090 --> 44:56.682
HANGOVER.

44:56.790 --> 44:59.588
WHAT TROUBLE DID YOU BOYS
GET INTO LAST NIGHT ?

44:59.690 --> 45:01.555
NONE, KEITH
HAD TO WORK.

45:01.660 --> 45:03.059
I HAD A CONCERT.

45:03.160 --> 45:03.990
YOU DID ?

45:04.100 --> 45:05.419
WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL ANYONE ?

45:05.530 --> 45:07.225
NEXT TIME.

45:07.330 --> 45:09.332
I'M GOING TO GO LIE DOWN
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

45:09.440 --> 45:11.829
ALRIGHT.

45:11.940 --> 45:14.431
YOU'RE GLAD THAT
YOU'RE NOT LIKE US,

45:14.540 --> 45:16.132
TIED TO THE OLD
BALL AND CHAIN.

45:16.240 --> 45:18.629
UNABLE TO DO WHATEVER
WE WANT WHEN WE WANT

45:18.750 --> 45:20.843
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DID.

45:57.850 --> 45:59.681
WHY DO YOU
LOOK SO SAD ?

45:59.790 --> 46:01.883
I WON'T
BE GONE FOREVER.

46:01.990 --> 46:04.709
I'LL BE BACK FROM MONTANA
IN A MONTH OR SO,

46:04.830 --> 46:06.718
AS SOON AS I GET
MARCIE OUT OF JAIL

46:06.830 --> 46:08.422
AND INTO SOME
SORT OF COUNSELING.

46:08.530 --> 46:10.191
WHICH I'M SURE
SHE'LL RESIST,

46:10.300 --> 46:12.063
ALWAYS DOES.

46:12.170 --> 46:13.819
DOES YOUR DAUGHTER
HAVE THESE EPISODES OFTEN ?

46:13.930 --> 46:15.397
PRETTY OFTEN.

46:15.500 --> 46:17.092
SHE'S A REAL NUTJOB.

46:17.200 --> 46:19.566
BUT WHAT CAN I DO,
I'M HER MOM.

46:19.670 --> 46:21.103
SHE REALLY
NEEDS ME.

46:21.210 --> 46:24.099
OH GOD, KIDS
ARE SUCH A DRAIN.

46:24.210 --> 46:26.678
THEY REALLY SUCK YOU DRY
IF YOU LET 'EM.

46:26.780 --> 46:29.146
MY KIDS DON'T NEED ME,
NOT AT ALL.

46:29.250 --> 46:31.275
THANK YOUR FUCKING
LUCKY STARS.

46:31.380 --> 46:33.610
SO, WHERE'S THAT COFFEE
YOU PROMISED ME ?

46:33.720 --> 46:37.656
CAN YOU WAIT
SEVEN MINUTES ?

46:37.760 --> 46:41.457
UM, NOT REALLY.

46:43.760 --> 46:46.820
( teapot whistling )

46:48.370 --> 46:51.294
( whispering )
Bettina, this isn't
right, get up.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.504
NO.

46:55.510 --> 46:57.501
I love spying.

46:57.610 --> 46:58.975
Well, I don't.

46:59.080 --> 47:01.071
Sure you do,
everyone does.

47:01.180 --> 47:02.943
We're all voyeurs
at heart.

47:03.050 --> 47:04.347
We're all just
dying to see

47:04.450 --> 47:06.714
everybody else's fucked up
weird private shit.

47:06.820 --> 47:10.517
( giggling )

47:16.900 --> 47:19.664
I'M GOING
TO MISS YOU SO MUCH.

47:19.770 --> 47:22.568
I'VE HAD SO MUCH FUN
WITH YOU.

47:22.670 --> 47:24.900
I WOULD NEVER
CROUCH HERE

47:25.010 --> 47:27.228
AND SPY ON ARTHUR
WITH ANYONE ELSE.

47:27.340 --> 47:33.006
DOLL, YOU GOTTA LEARN
HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN FUN.

47:33.110 --> 47:36.876
HE'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT
I WOULD CALL EYE CANDY.

47:39.290 --> 47:42.179
"UH-OH, I THINK I JUST
SWALLOWED MY TONGUE."

47:42.290 --> 47:44.281
( giggling )

47:49.230 --> 47:53.599
AND I KNOW THAT EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENS, HAPPENS FOR A REASON.

47:53.700 --> 47:57.864
I ONLY WISH THAT WILL
COULD HAVE KNOWN HIS SON, TOM.

47:57.970 --> 48:00.768
THERE'S SO MUCH
HE COULD HAVE TAUGHT HIM.

48:00.870 --> 48:02.804
THAT'S A LOAD
OF BULLSHIT.

48:02.910 --> 48:06.368
YOU MET MY KID,
HE TURNED OUT FINE.

48:06.480 --> 48:09.472
HE DIDN'T NEED A FUCK-UP
LIKE ME TO STICK AROUND.

48:09.580 --> 48:12.014
ME DRIVING OFF THE SIDE
OF THE ROAD THAT NIGHT

48:12.120 --> 48:14.111
WAS THE BEST THING
FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED.

48:14.220 --> 48:16.359
SERIOUSLY, DIANE AND I,
WE HAD A SHIT RELATIONSHIP

48:16.460 --> 48:18.416
WHICH TOTALLY WOULD HAVE
SCREWED UP THAT KID.

48:18.520 --> 48:21.683
JUST LIKE YOU AND LISA
ARE GONNA SCREW UP MAYA.

48:21.790 --> 48:23.189
FUCK YOU.

48:23.300 --> 48:24.324
YOU JUST WANT
TO STAY IN THIS

48:24.430 --> 48:26.159
TO PROVE WHAT A GOOD GUY
YOU CAN BE.

48:26.270 --> 48:27.965
NOT BECAUSE
YOU LOVE LISA.

48:28.070 --> 48:29.799
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT ME,
YOU FUCKING IDIOT !

48:29.900 --> 48:31.663
THERE ARE OTHER
LIVES AT STAKE.

48:31.770 --> 48:33.761
DON'T GIVE ME
THAT SHIT.

48:33.870 --> 48:35.929
YOU ARE SO
FUCKING TRAPPED.

48:36.040 --> 48:37.905
YEAH ?
YEAH.

48:38.010 --> 48:40.945
WELL, WHO ISN'T ?

48:41.050 --> 48:43.314
THE ONLY WAY NOT TO BE TRAPPED
IS TO NOT HAVE ANYTHING.

48:43.420 --> 48:45.445
YOU LOOK ME IN THE EYE
AND TELL ME THAT

48:45.550 --> 48:47.518
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T WANT
TO GET IN YOUR CAR

48:47.620 --> 48:49.815
AND JUST
START DRIVING

48:49.920 --> 48:52.320
AND NEVER LOOK BACK.

48:52.430 --> 48:54.728
COME ON...

48:54.830 --> 48:58.288
I DARE YA.

49:01.570 --> 49:05.802
BUT OF COURSE HE DID MANAGE
TO PULL OFF ONE BIG TRICK.

49:05.910 --> 49:09.300
HE MADE HIMSELF DISAPPEAR
FOR 25 YEARS.

49:10.640 --> 49:11.834
CLAIRE.

49:11.940 --> 49:14.602
CLAIRE.

49:14.710 --> 49:17.144
HI, I'VE BEEN
CALLING YOUR NAME.

49:17.250 --> 49:19.081
YOU DIDN'T
HEAR ME ?

49:19.190 --> 49:21.385
NO, SORRY, I WAS
TOTALLY IN MY HEAD.

49:21.490 --> 49:23.310
DID YOU GET MY MESSAGE
FROM LAST NIGHT ?

49:23.420 --> 49:25.923
OH, NO, I GOT IN
REALLY LATE.

49:26.030 --> 49:28.055
IT'S OKAY, IT WAS ABOUT
MY BROTHER'S WEDDING.

49:28.160 --> 49:31.220
GET THIS, THERE'S
A REHEARSAL DINNER.

49:31.330 --> 49:33.298
RUSSELL...

49:33.400 --> 49:37.598
MAYBE IT'S NOT SUCH A GOOD IDEA
FOR US TO, YOU KNOW...

49:37.700 --> 49:40.134
DATE.

49:41.340 --> 49:43.035
IT'S SO WEIRD
THAT YOU SAY THAT.

49:43.140 --> 49:44.903
IT'S SO WEIRD THAT
YOU SAY THAT,

49:45.010 --> 49:46.568
BECAUSE I WAS THINKING
THE SAME THING.

49:46.680 --> 49:49.171
AND I DIDN'T
WANT TO SAY IT

49:49.280 --> 49:52.249
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
I'D SOUND CRAZY

49:52.350 --> 49:54.648
BEING THE ONE WHO STARTED
THIS WHOLE THING.

49:54.750 --> 49:59.619
SO, YOU'RE OKAY, JUST LIKE
STAYING THE WAY WE ARE ?

49:59.730 --> 50:01.288
TOTALLY.

50:01.390 --> 50:03.722
TOTALLY.

50:06.570 --> 50:07.594
YES.

50:07.700 --> 50:08.860
GREAT.

50:08.970 --> 50:11.689
I HAVE TO GIVE
THIS STUFF TO OLIVIER.

50:35.130 --> 50:38.349
( dog barking )

50:47.110 --> 50:48.964
OH, I'M SORRY.

50:49.080 --> 50:51.935
DID I READ
THE CHART WRONG ?

50:52.040 --> 50:53.644
I THOUGHT YOU
INITIALED THE LATE LUNCH.

50:53.750 --> 50:55.741
I DID, I JUST
GOT HUNGRY.

50:55.850 --> 50:57.317
IS THAT OKAY ?

50:57.420 --> 50:58.614
OF COURSE.

50:58.720 --> 51:01.280
I'M GLAD TO HAVE
THE COMPANY.

51:02.390 --> 51:04.415
WOULD YOU LIKE
A LITTLE FRITTATA ?

51:04.520 --> 51:07.956
I WOULD LOVE
A LITTLE FRITTATA.

51:08.060 --> 51:11.291
(canng)

51:19.270 --> 51:21.830
I WAS JUST
FOOLING AROUND.

51:21.940 --> 51:23.828
I NEVER DREAMED
IT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK.

51:23.940 --> 51:26.500
THEY WORK,
THEY DEFINITELY WORK.

51:26.610 --> 51:28.840
I FEEL
SO TERRIBLE.

51:28.950 --> 51:32.386
AND IT WASN'T
EVEN MY CHEESE.

51:32.490 --> 51:34.583
THAT'S OKAY.

51:35.290 --> 51:36.655
ON THE OTHER HAND,

51:36.760 --> 51:38.216
THEY HAVE GERMS.

51:38.320 --> 51:41.619
THEY REALLY
DO DESERVE TO DIE.

51:46.970 --> 51:48.494
ARE YOU JUST
WAKING UP ?

51:48.600 --> 51:51.933
I WAS UP, THEN I WENT
BACK TO SLEEP AGAIN.

51:52.040 --> 51:54.907
WHY ARE YOU HOME
FOR LUNCH ?

51:55.010 --> 51:57.069
I WANTED
TO SEE YOU.

51:57.180 --> 51:59.341
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HOME
BEFORE ME LAST NIGHT.

51:59.450 --> 52:01.748
I WAITED UP FOR A WHILE,
BUT I MUST'VE FALLEN ASLEEP.

52:01.850 --> 52:03.511
WHAT TIME
DID YOU GET IN ?

52:03.620 --> 52:04.575
LATE.

52:04.680 --> 52:07.080
I THOUGHT YOUR SHIFT
ENDED AT 11:00.

52:07.190 --> 52:10.489
IT DID.

52:13.090 --> 52:14.626
I JUST DROVE AROUND.

52:14.730 --> 52:16.925
I NEEDED SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT THINGS.

52:17.030 --> 52:18.429
LIKE WHAT ?

52:18.530 --> 52:23.069
THIS JOB WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE TEMPORARY,

52:23.170 --> 52:25.206
BUT IT'S REALLY STARTING
NOT TO FEEL THAT WAY.

52:25.310 --> 52:28.131
LAST NIGHT I REALIZED
I NEEDED TO MAKE A MOVE

52:28.240 --> 52:29.832
AND DO SOMETHING
DIFFERENT.

52:29.940 --> 52:33.376
WHAT MADE YOU
REALIZE THAT ?

52:36.980 --> 52:39.312
IT'S JUST TIME.

52:39.420 --> 52:42.014
HOW WAS
YOUR CONCERT ?

52:42.120 --> 52:44.884
IT WAS...

52:44.990 --> 52:46.958
IT WAS GREAT.

52:47.060 --> 52:48.459
I REALLY WISH
YOU COULD'VE BEEN THERE,

52:48.560 --> 52:53.497
BUT I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU COULDN'T BE.

52:53.600 --> 52:57.434
* WELL, I WAS BORN TOO LATE
TO PLAY IN THE ROLLING STONES *

52:57.540 --> 53:01.306
* I DON'T KNOW JIMMY PAGE
I NEVER MET YOKO ONO *

53:01.410 --> 53:03.173

53:03.280 --> 53:05.748

53:05.850 --> 53:09.001

53:09.110 --> 53:10.941
WHOO-HOO !

53:11.050 --> 53:12.745
* DON'T DRIVE A CADILLAC

53:12.850 --> 53:16.058
WHOO-HOO !

53:16.160 --> 53:17.957
* NOT DEAD YET

53:18.060 --> 53:20.654
(yelling )

53:59.030 --> 54:02.193
* NOT DEAD YET

54:02.300 --> 54:06.407
* NOT DEAD YET

54:06.510 --> 54:09.775
* I'M A MAD DOG FIGHTING
WITH THE WALL AGAINST MY BACK *

54:09.880 --> 54:13.873
* YOU BETTER GET A BIGGER GUN,
YOU BETTER GET A BIGGER GUN *

54:13.980 --> 54:16.744
* NOT DEAD YET

54:16.850 --> 54:19.785
* NOT DEAD YET

54:19.890 --> 54:23.712
* NOT DEAD YET

54:23.820 --> 54:26.721
* I'M A WILD CARD WAITIN'
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DECK *

54:26.830 --> 54:30.698
* YOU BETTER GET A BIGGER GUN,
I'M NOT DEAD YET *

54:30.800 --> 54:33.860
* NOT DEAD YET

54:33.970 --> 54:36.996

54:37.100 --> 54:40.308
