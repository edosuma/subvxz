My name is Michael Westen.

00:02.870 --> 00:05.573
I used to be a spy until--

00:05.639 --> 00:07.975
- [ Man ] We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.
- [ Whistles ]

00:08.042 --> 00:10.444
[ Michael Narrating ]
When you're burned,
you've got nothing--

00:10.511 --> 00:13.114
no cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:13.181 --> 00:16.417
- You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?

00:16.484 --> 00:18.086
Miami.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.788
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.557
- You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you--
- [ Laughs ]

00:23.624 --> 00:26.494
- a trigger-happy
ex-girlfriend--
- Should we shoot them?

00:26.560 --> 00:29.330
an old friend
who used to inform on you
to the F.B.I.--

00:29.397 --> 00:31.632
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.068
- Family too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:34.135 --> 00:36.437
- if you're desperate.
- Someone needs
your help, Michael.

00:36.504 --> 00:40.774
Bottom line:
As long as you're burned,
you're not going anywhere.

00:46.046 --> 00:49.483
[ Michael Narrating ]
National intelligence agencies
and local law enforcement...

00:49.550 --> 00:52.019
work together more often
than you might think.

00:52.086 --> 00:55.256
Most metropolitan
police stations have an office
called a fusion center,

00:55.323 --> 00:57.791
where classified intel
is collected in one place.

00:57.858 --> 01:00.928
It's a great resource
if you need information fast.

01:00.994 --> 01:04.498
Unfortunately, it does involve
breaking into a police station.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.200
You sure
this is the move, Mike?

01:06.267 --> 01:08.802
To find the list
of the people who burned me,
I'd break into the Pentagon.

01:08.869 --> 01:11.505
Okay, but you don't even know if
you're gonna get what you need.

01:11.572 --> 01:15.243
The guy who stole it--
Justin Walsh--
worked with the D.O.D.

01:15.309 --> 01:18.946
Fusion center monitors
the communication of anyone
with a job in national security.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.681
They'll have something.
Okay.

01:20.748 --> 01:24.084
You're Mr. Elias Schmidt,
Shadyglade Neighborhood Watch.

01:24.152 --> 01:27.755
You got a meeting
with Officer Pepiol
in Community Outreach.

01:27.821 --> 01:30.491
His office is on the floor
below the center database.

01:30.558 --> 01:33.161
- Elias?
- Your friends call you Eli.

01:33.227 --> 01:36.130
It doesn't matter.
Once you get past security,
you're on your own.

01:36.197 --> 01:39.066
[ Groans ]
And no action-guy stuff,
okay?

01:39.133 --> 01:42.102
- Your gunshot wound's
gonna be a little tender.
- It's not tender, Sam.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.871
Keep the engine running.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.875
[ Michael Narrating ]
Because undercover cops
and confidential informants...

01:47.941 --> 01:49.510
don't like
their pictures taken--

01:49.577 --> 01:51.279
Here you go, sir.
Go on up.

01:51.345 --> 01:55.316
only the public areas
of police stations
are kept under surveillance.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.953
So once
you're past the lobby,

02:00.020 --> 02:03.657
the only cameras
you have to avoid
are the ones taking mug shots.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.726
Mr. Schmidt, I'm Officer Pep--
I think you're looking
for someone else.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.262
I'm here to see
Detective Marano,
Homicide.

02:12.933 --> 02:16.003
[ Michael Narrating ]
Get caught with a lock-pick set
in a police station,

02:16.069 --> 02:17.805
and you've got problems.

02:17.871 --> 02:21.209
A pair of cheap sunglasses
is less suspicious
and just about as effective.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.577
Modify them in advance,

02:23.644 --> 02:26.747
and you can use the stems
as a rake and tension tool.

02:26.814 --> 02:30.251
And if you get caught,
you're just a guy
with some busted sunglasses.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.819

[ Computer Beeping ]

02:46.767 --> 02:48.569
[ Beeping ]

02:50.904 --> 02:53.974
He checked in using
the name "Elias Schmidt,"
but never made it to my office.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.043
He's loose in this building.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.911
We've got a trespasser
in the facility.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.881
Lock down the exits.
We need to do a full
I.D. check.

[ Officers Chattering,
Shouting ]
[ Police Radio Chatter ]

03:10.291 --> 03:13.261
[ Michael Narrating ]
Police officers uphold
the chain of command as sacred.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.062
Act like you're in charge,

03:15.128 --> 03:17.998
and someone new to the force
won't dare question
your authority.

03:18.065 --> 03:20.234
Crazy son of a bitch
jumped!
He went out the window?

03:20.301 --> 03:22.536
The guy is out of his mind.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.806
Rookie, are you deaf?
Call all units outside. Go!

03:25.873 --> 03:27.808
Yeah! I'm on it!

03:29.977 --> 03:31.845
[ Officer ]
Escaped! Let's move it!
[ Siren Wailing ]

03:31.912 --> 03:33.547
Oh, come on, Mike.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.216
[ Officers Shouting ]
Check out back!

03:36.284 --> 03:37.751
Check the side!
Hold there!

03:39.287 --> 03:40.854
Time to go, Sam.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.823
I ever tell you
you're the reason
I drink, Mikey?

03:56.937 --> 03:59.540
[ Michael Narrating ]
It's hard to forgive someone
after a betrayal,

03:59.607 --> 04:01.875
even if it was for a good cause.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.978
There's nothing more difficult
to repair in the field
than trust.

04:05.045 --> 04:08.849
You know what? Next time
you're gonna pull something
like, I don't know,

04:08.916 --> 04:12.420
breaking into a fusion center,
I'd appreciate
a little heads-up.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.488
Well, you're here now.
And this is every e-mail...

04:14.555 --> 04:16.557
Walsh has written
in the last year.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.858
Sharing all I've got, Jesse.
I'm just saying.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.562
Whatever our past
disagreements may be,

04:21.629 --> 04:23.564
I'm still your partner
on this.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.899
Right. And when did you plan
on telling your partner...

04:25.966 --> 04:28.268
what you just discovered
in that stack there?

04:29.637 --> 04:31.672
You've read the same page
three times.

04:33.907 --> 04:37.978
Walsh sent messages
to alphanumeric
e-mail addresses...

04:38.045 --> 04:40.514
in Taiwan, Peru,
Bulgaria.

04:40.581 --> 04:43.216
It's disguised as a discussion
about stamp collecting,
but check it out.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.053
They're talking
about minimum bids,
delivery conditions.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.422
He's auctioning the list.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.658
We need to find out where
it's happening, intercept it.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.660
To track down guys like that,
it's gonna take some help.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.261
We're gonna need
somebody with some pull,

04:54.328 --> 04:55.796
somebody in the government.

04:55.863 --> 04:58.332
- What about your old handler?
- Marv? No.

04:58.399 --> 05:01.469
Besides, Marv's by the book.
If he helped us,
he'd file a report on it.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.136
You worked with the man
for eight years.

05:03.203 --> 05:05.906
You have no idea how to
motivate him to do it quietly?

05:05.973 --> 05:09.677
What, you want me
to blackmail him? Oh,
that's good. That's great.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.746
- You know what's at stake.
- [ Exhales ]

05:14.782 --> 05:18.018
There might be a way to get
to Marv. It's a low blow, man.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.953
It's gonna have to come
from somebody he doesn't know.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.255
I could call Sam.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.692

of your stuff from the house.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.994

wanna go back to the loft?

- Your shoulder's still leaking.
- I'm fine, Ma.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.465
No. You got shot.

05:31.532 --> 05:34.368
Yeah, but, thanks to Jesse,
just in the right spot.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.210
Tell you boys what.

05:43.276 --> 05:44.945
Why don't I make margaritas,

05:45.012 --> 05:47.014
and we'll work on clearing
the air between you two?

05:47.080 --> 05:49.750
I gotta run.
Fi's paying me
by the hour.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.352
Fi-- Fi got a job?

05:52.420 --> 05:54.855
- She didn't call me.
- Maybe she wanted you
to get your rest.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.736
You could've
mentioned...

docks his boat
out in the boonies.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.772
Sorry.
But I'm glad you came.

you'd be up for a gig.

Why not?
I'm all for
honest work.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.846
I meant us working together--
again, by choice.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.782
Okay. Can I just
say something real quick?

06:21.849 --> 06:24.217
And then we'll
never have to
bring it up again.

06:24.284 --> 06:28.121
When I found out you'd been
lying to me, it hurt. Okay?

06:28.188 --> 06:30.424
But I know you only did it
'cause Michael asked you to.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.292
You were being loyal to him.
I can respect that.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.528
I can forgive you for that.
So we're cool.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.830
All right? You're not the one
I have the issue with.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.669
- We should talk about
you and Michael.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.606
Just tell me
who we're meeting.

06:48.375 --> 06:52.145
He tried to buy a .357 from
a gun dealer friend of mine.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.147
But he was so upset,

06:54.214 --> 06:57.551
my friend gave him my number
instead of the gun.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.088
Stuart, I'm Fiona.
This is Jesse.

07:01.154 --> 07:04.157
- What is he, your muscle?
- No. I have plenty of muscle.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.193
He's more like a sidekick.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.596
Why don't you just tell us
about your problem, Stuart?

07:08.662 --> 07:10.798
My sister Stephanie's
in trouble.

07:10.864 --> 07:15.268
She fell in love with this
Venezuelan diplomat-- Marco.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.805
He's dirty.
Think he moves drugs.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.173
I warned her,
but she moved to Caracas.

07:22.643 --> 07:26.246
Didn't take long before
he started beating on her.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.982
So I went down there myself
and brought her back.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.852
- Good for you.
- Somehow, he found Stephanie.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.187
Now he's holding her
like a prisoner.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.990
I tried to get her.
All I got was this beating.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.293
I think he's gonna take her
back to Venezuela.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.762
So you haven't gone
to the cops yet.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.564
He's a diplomat.
He's practically
untouchable.

07:43.631 --> 07:46.967
He told the cops
Stephanie was on vacation,
and they just left. That's it.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.802
Don't worry.
We'll get her back.

07:48.869 --> 07:52.039

I want to come with you.

07:52.105 --> 07:55.509
I'm her big brother.
I'm supposed to protect her.

Scouting security

32:46.165 --> 32:49.701
Damn right. I mean--
You talk to your fed buddies?

32:49.768 --> 32:52.438
Yeah. Jesse's leaving
the case in the bag check
at the bus station.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.273
We make a call,
they pick it up.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.108
No questions,
no connections to us.

32:56.175 --> 32:59.478
Well, he'd better head out soon.
Traffic on the causeway's
gonna be a beast.

33:04.716 --> 33:08.387
Fortunately, the weapon
was in a standard
shockproof clamshell.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.357
I have a friend...

33:11.423 --> 33:14.993
who sells grenades
out in Hallandale
who had a spare.

33:15.061 --> 33:16.728
Tracker's ready.

33:16.795 --> 33:19.965
Nice range,
burst signal on a timer
so she can't sweep for it.

33:20.032 --> 33:22.934
- [ Device Beeps ]
- Wherever she takes it,
we will find her.

33:23.001 --> 33:26.472
Now all we need
is something nasty
to put in the case.

33:29.075 --> 33:32.578
[ Michael Narrating ] Making
fake weapons is a little-known
but important art.

33:32.644 --> 33:35.814
If you don't want
to put real killing power
in the hands of a bad guy,

33:35.881 --> 33:37.449
you need
a convincing substitute.

33:37.516 --> 33:41.153
A fake chemical weapon
has to be able
to pass a field test--

33:41.220 --> 33:43.089
usually a simple
chemical analysis...

33:43.155 --> 33:45.524
and a cruel demonstration
with a small animal.

33:45.591 --> 33:49.595
Strong pesticide mixed with
tear gas and diesel fuel
will do the trick...

33:49.661 --> 33:52.598
without killing anyone
who weighs more than 20 pounds.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.502
Try not to drop it
on your way to the station.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.975
Okay. It's been
an hour, people.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.212
Has it occurred to anyone
that maybe Natalie's
not going for this?

34:06.278 --> 34:08.013
Be patient, Jesse.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.683
People who are buying
chemical weapons aren't
generally forgiving types.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.985
She can't afford to risk
not having the real thing.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.786
I'm just saying, you know,

34:15.853 --> 34:18.290
maybe we could've
given her a better hint
than "the causeway"...

34:18.357 --> 34:20.426
to get her
to the right bus station.

34:20.492 --> 34:24.029
If it was
too easy, she'd get suspicious.
She'll figure it out.

34:24.096 --> 34:25.731
[ Beeping ]
Wait a minute.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.300
Yeah. She's got it.
It's on the move.
We're in business.

34:30.302 --> 34:33.871
She's in a black Sebring.
She's heading north.

34:33.938 --> 34:36.275
[ Over Headset ]
Sam, you and Mike
take the causeway.

34:36.342 --> 34:39.545
I'm gonna send Fi
northeast on Townsend.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.147
It's go time.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.661
So that's
the dragon lady's den.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.496
Never thought I would
miss the days...

34:57.563 --> 35:00.299
when places like this
were just used
for smuggling cocaine.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.675
She's got both cases, Fi.
Which canister's
the real one?

35:09.741 --> 35:12.478
The black one.
Mine was silver.

35:13.179 --> 35:15.214
Shall we do this?

35:15.281 --> 35:19.050
Uh, that's a chemical weapon
in there, Fi. We can't afford
to go in there shooting.

35:19.117 --> 35:23.088
This goes wrong and this
entire area's a hazmat site
for the next decade.

35:23.155 --> 35:24.990
I'll do this quietly.

35:25.056 --> 35:27.859
If "quietly" doesn't work,
we're coming in
to make some noise.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.628
Fair enough.

35:30.996 --> 35:32.931
[ Beeping ]

35:32.998 --> 35:34.065
[ Hammer Cocks ]
Hi again.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.067
Move and I kill you.

35:36.134 --> 35:39.338
[ Groans ]
You don't quit, do you?

35:39.405 --> 35:41.740
Can't you leave a girl alone
to make a living?

35:41.807 --> 35:43.542
You should've picked
another way to get rich.
Let's go.

35:43.609 --> 35:46.144
Wait. Just--
First, you gotta tell me.

35:46.212 --> 35:48.146
Did you really
switch out the case?

35:48.214 --> 35:50.716
Which one's real--
silver or black?

35:50.782 --> 35:52.551
[ Vehicle Approaches ]
Let's just leave it
as a mystery.

35:52.618 --> 35:55.120
It'll give you something
to think about in prison.
Let's go.

35:55.187 --> 35:56.988
Mmm, I don't think so.

35:57.055 --> 36:00.292
- See, you're cute
and you're clever.
- [ Vehicle Doors Open ]

36:00.359 --> 36:02.328
But your timing sucks.
[ Vehicle Doors Close ]

36:02.394 --> 36:05.264
Your little trick ate up my day,
so instead of getting
my hair done,

36:05.331 --> 36:08.934
I had to come straight
to the buy, and-- [ Sighs ]

36:09.000 --> 36:11.303
my buyers are here.
[ Door Opens ]

36:13.104 --> 36:15.841
- You don't wanna do this,
Natalie.
- Actually, I do.

36:15.907 --> 36:17.609
I really, really do.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.546
Hello, Karl.
Thanks for coming.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.681
We have ourselves
a little situation here.

36:22.748 --> 36:25.517
- Afternoon, guys.
- And you are who?

36:25.584 --> 36:27.753
He came to interrupt
the transaction.

36:27.819 --> 36:30.756
So do me a fave--
shoot him.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.358
You wanted to know
who I was, Karl.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.860
I'm the guy holding a gun
on a can of Novichok agent.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.828
All right,
I've seen enough.
Time to move.

36:36.895 --> 36:39.631
Fi, against five guys
with automatic weapons?

36:39.698 --> 36:42.934
Come on. We roll in there heavy,
Mike's not gonna last
two seconds.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.804
You wanted to know which one
was the real one?
Now you do.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.506
Oh, that's interesting.

36:48.574 --> 36:51.109
Michael's holding
my fake nerve gas hostage.

36:51.176 --> 36:53.445
I pull the trigger,
the bullet releases
the chemical.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.146
It'll spread
about 50 yards.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.549
First, your eyes will burn,
your face will go numb.

36:57.616 --> 37:01.487
If the exposure's not too bad,
you'll live about five minutes.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.622
Too bad the nearest hospital's
10 minutes away.

37:03.689 --> 37:06.425
Last chance to walk away.

37:06.492 --> 37:09.661
He's bluffing.
He's not gonna
kill himself for this.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.230
And you'd rather die
than give us that weapon, hmm?

37:15.634 --> 37:16.968
Try me.

37:20.839 --> 37:23.141
- [ Man ] Quick! Get out!

37:23.208 --> 37:24.776
Go! Go! Get to the cars!

37:24.843 --> 37:27.513
[ Michael Narrating ]
You never forget
your first exposure to tear gas.

37:27.579 --> 37:30.048
It feels like you're drowning
in your own fluids.

37:30.115 --> 37:33.319
There's a reason why nothing
induces panic like a gas attack.

37:33.385 --> 37:34.520
[ Coughing ]

37:34.586 --> 37:36.822
Smile, Natalie.
It's not like you're dying.

[ Sobbing ]
I have to go
to the hospital!

37:38.790 --> 37:42.093
No. Michael shot a cylinder
full of tear gas and pesticides.

Hey, I got
more good news for you.
You're gonna be a hero.

You are gonna call the F.B.I.
and tell them...

37:49.134 --> 37:51.703
where they can find
a stolen container
of Novichok agent.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.740
Natalie, you forgot
your chemical weapon
back there.

37:55.741 --> 37:56.942
Touché.

37:57.008 --> 37:59.110
Boy! You know, your buyers
and those Venezuelan guys...

37:59.177 --> 38:01.580
are gonna be asking
a whole lot of questions
when this goes public.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.749
So your best bet,
if you want to stay alive,

38:03.815 --> 38:05.817
is to make nice with the feds
and tell them everything.

38:05.884 --> 38:08.053
And I mean everything.
The number to dial is 911.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.822

from Homeland Security.

to dial that phone.

gave you anything.

for a world of hurt.

Before you go down this road,
I want you to ask yourself
something.

to get you two together.
