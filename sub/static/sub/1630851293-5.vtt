OTHER THINGS -- DIRECT PAYMENTS

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
OF $1400 TO MANY AMERICANS.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS CHAIR OF

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
49 REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
VOTED NO ON SATURDAY.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
>> John: YEAH, HE DID THAT.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
AND YOU DON'T GET CREDIT FOR

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE KNOWS

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HAPPEN.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
THIS EXACT SAME REASON THAT

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
PRINCE CHARLES DOESN'T GET TO

TWEET "GREAT INTERVIEW, OPRAH,

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
TO HELP MILLIONS OF AMERICANS,

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
AND IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
THAT EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
OPPOSED IT.

07:29.000 --> 07:29.000
AND IF ANY OF THEM EVER COME

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
-- I'M SORRY TO SAY --

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
TUCKER CARLSON.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
A MAN WHO GIVES "TUCKERS"

08:49.000 --> 08:49.000
AN EVEN WORSE NAME THAN THEY

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
ALREADY HAVE.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
THIS WEEK, AS HE SEEMS TO EVERY

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
WEEK, TUCKER SET OFF A BIT OF

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
A FIRESTORM.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
>> SO WE'VE GOT NEW HAIRSTYLES

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
AND MATERNITY FLIGHT SUITS,

08:57.000 --> 08:57.000
PREGNANT WOMEN ARE GONNA FIGHT

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
OUR WARS.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
IT'S A MOCKERY OF

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
THE U.S. MILITARY.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
WHILE CHINA'S MILITARY BECOMES

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
MORE MASCULINE, AS IT'S

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
ASSEMBLED THE WORLD'S LARGEST

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
NAVY, OUR MILITARY NEEDS TO

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
BECOME, AS JOE BIDEN SAYS, MORE

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
FEMININE -- WHATEVER FEMININE

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
MEANS ANYMORE, SINCE MEN AND

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
WOMEN NO LONGER EXIST.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
ABOUT, YOU PERFORMATIVELY

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
OUTRAGED WEDGE SALAD?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
HE'S PACKED A LOT IN THERE --

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
FROM TRANSPHOBIA, TO WEIRDLY

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
EXTOLLING THE MASCULINITY OF

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
CHINA'S NAVY, TO HIS COMPLETELY

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
MISPLACED OUTRAGE AT JOE BIDEN

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
OVER THOSE FLIGHT SUITS, WHICH

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
WERE PART OF AN INITIATIVE

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
THAT STARTED WHEN TRUMP WAS

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
PRESIDENT, AND ALSO INCLUDED

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
ENSURING THAT BODY ARMOR

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
ACTUALLY FITS WOMEN SERVICE

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
MEMBERS, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
A GOOD IDEA.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
THOSE COMMENTS SPARKED AN

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR CYCLE OF

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
CONDEMNATION, DEFENSIVENESS, AND

09:43.000 --> 09:43.000
HYPE.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY WEEK,

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
TUCKER HAS ANOTHER ONE OF THESE

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
MINI-CONTROVERSIES.

09:47.000 --> 09:47.000
LAST WEEK IT WAS THE DR. SEUSS

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
BULLSHIT.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
AND LOOK, I'D LOVE NOTHING MORE

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
THAN NOT TO PLAY INTO HIS WILDLY

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
OFFENSIVE SHTICK.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
YOU MIGHT EVEN BE THINKING,

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
"WHY GIVE HIM THE ATTENTION THAT

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
HE'S SO CLEARLY TROLLING FOR?"

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
BUT THE FACT IS, WE'RE NOT

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
GIVING TUCKER ANY ATTENTION HE'S

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
NOT ALREADY GETTING A LOT OF.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
THE NIGHT HE MADE THOSE FLIGHT

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
SUIT REMARKS, HE WAS THE MOST

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
WATCHED SHOW ON CABLE.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
HE AVERAGES OVER THREE MILLION

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
VIEWERS A NIGHT, AND DOES WELL

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
IN THE KEY 25 TO 54 DEMO --

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
MEANING YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
WATCHING HIM, AS WELL AS THE

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
NORMAL FOX AUDIENCE OF RETIREES

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
AND THEIR SAD, IMPRISONED PETS.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
HE'S SO IMPORTANT TO THE

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
NETWORK, THEY'RE EXPANDING HIS

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
PRESENCE -- LAUNCHING A NEW

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
VIDEO PODCAST AND LONG-FORM

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
DOCUMENTARY SERIES.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
TUCKER'S ALSO BEEN FLOATED AS A

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
POTENTIAL FUTURE PRESIDENTIAL

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
CANDIDATE, WHICH SHOULD BE

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
SERIOUSLY ALARMING, BECAUSE OF

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
ALL THE THINGS TUCKER IS --

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
A CONSPIRACY THEORIST, A

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
MISOGYNIST, ISLAMOPHOBIC,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
A TROLL -- ONE OF

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
THE MOST DANGEROUS IS THAT HE IS

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
THE MOST PROMINENT VESSEL IN

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
AMERICA FOR WHITE SUPREMACIST

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
TALKING POINTS.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
AND I ALREADY KNOW WHAT TUCKER

10:45.000 --> 10:45.000
WILL SAY ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
WHENEVER THE TOPIC COMES UP,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
HE HAS THE SAME REACTION:

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
>> WHITE NATIONALISM.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
LET'S BE LITERAL FOR A MINUTE.

10:57.000 --> 10:57.000
WHAT IS THAT EXACTLY?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT

10:59.000 --> 10:59.000
WHITE NATIONALIST MEANS AND

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
I'M NOT GONNA GO DOWN THAT

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
RABBIT HOLE WITH YOU NOW.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
>> WHY DOESN'T ANYONE EVER

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
DEFINE WHITE SUPREMACY?

11:03.000 --> 11:03.000
WHAT IS WHITE SUPREMACY?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
>> CAN SOMEBODY TELL US

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
IN VERY CLEAR LANGUAGE WHAT

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
A WHITE SUPREMACIST IS?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
>> John: OKAY, FIRST: "VERY

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
CLEAR LANGUAGE" SEEMS LIKE A

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
HIGH BAR TO CLEAR FOR A MAN WHO

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
SPENDS 85% OF HIS TIME MAKING

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
THE BEFUDDLED FACE OF A

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
13TH-CENTURY FARMER LEARNING

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
ABOUT BITCOIN.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
AND I PROMISE, WE'RE ACTUALLY

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
GOING TO GIVE TUCKER A PRETTY

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
CLEAR DEFINITION OF WHITE

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
SUPREMACY LATER IN THIS PIECE.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
AND HE SEEMS TO NEED ONE,

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
BECAUSE WHENEVER HE TRIES TO

11:25.000 --> 11:25.000
DEFINE IT HIMSELF, IT TENDS TO

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
BE SELF-SERVINGLY NARROW.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
>> THIS SHOW WAS NOT ON THE AIR

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
FOR SIX MONTHS BEFORE THERE WAS

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
AN ORGANIZED AND HIGHLY

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN BY PROMINENT

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
DEMOCRATS TO DENOUNCE US AS

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
WHITE SUPREMACIST.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED,

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
THE PEOPLE WHO WORK ON THIS

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
SHOW, MANY OF THEM KIDS, WERE

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED BY THAT.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
WHITE SUPREMACISTS?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
WHAT'S WORSE THAN THAT?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
THE PHRASE EVOKES IMAGES OF

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
BURNING CROSSES AND LYNCHINGS.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
IT'S AWFUL.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, I'M SO

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
SORRY, TUCKER.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOUR SHOW WAS

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
STAFFED ENTIRELY BY CHILDREN.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
I NEVER INTENDED FOR THEM TO GET

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
CAUGHT UP IN THIS.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
SO MY SINCERE APOLOGIES,

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
YOU TINY LITTLE RASCALS.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
BUT "I DON'T BURN CROSSES OR

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
LYNCH PEOPLE, SO I CAN'T BE A

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
WHITE SUPREMACIST" IS A PRETTY

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
WEAK ARGUMENT.

12:09.000 --> 12:09.000
IT'S LIKE SAYING "I CAN'T BE

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
AN ANTI-SEMITE BECAUSE I DIDN'T

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
DO THE HOLOCAUST" OR I CAN'T

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
BE A SEXUAL PREDATOR

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
BECAUSE I DIDN'T PRODUCE

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
"GOOD WILL HUNTING."

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
TO BE A TERRIBLE PERSON.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
AND TUCKER -- CONVENIENTLY FOR

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
HIM -- DOESN'T FIT NEATLY INTO

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
A LOT OF PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
"WHITE SUPREMACIST."

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
ESPECIALLY IF THEY SHARE HIS

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
DEFINITION, THAT IT MUST

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
REQUIRE BURNING CROSSES,

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
KLAN HOODS, AND A NAME TAG

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
THAT SAYS "HELLO, MY NAME IS

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
A RACIST."

12:33.000 --> 12:33.000
YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE FRIENDS WHO

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
THINK, "TUCKER CAN'T BE RACIST.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I'VE NEVER HEARD HIM SAY THE

12:37.000 --> 12:37.000
"N-WORD," AS IF THAT IS THE

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
FUCKING BAR.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
BUT FOR THE RECORD: WHITE

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
SUPREMACISTS THEMSELVES

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
SEEM TO BE BIG FANS OF WHAT

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
TUCKER'S BEEN DOING.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
JUST LISTEN TO DEREK BLACK, A

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
FORMER WHITE SUPREMACIST WHOSE

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
FATHER STARTED STORMFRONT

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
-- THE OLDEST, LARGEST WHITE

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
SUPREMACIST SITE ON THE INTERNET

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
-- TALK ABOUT JUST HOW MUCH HIS

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
FAMILY LIKES TUCKER'S SHOW.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
>> MY FAMILY WATCHES

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
TUCKER CARLSON'S SHOW ONCE AND

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
THEN WATCHES IT ON THE REPLAY

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT HE IS

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
MAKING THE WHITE NATIONALIST

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
TALKING POINTS BETTER THAN THEY

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
HAVE.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO GET SOME

13:09.000 --> 13:09.000
TIPS ON HOW TO -- HOW TO ADVANCE

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
IT.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
>> John: YEAH.

13:14.000 --> 13:14.000
THEY WATCH IT

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
ONCE TO ENJOY IT, AND A SECOND

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
TIME TO LEARN FROM IT.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
THEY WATCH TUCKER THE SAME WAY I

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
WATCH "THE DREW BARRYMORE SHOW."

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
FIRST TIME FOR FUN, SECOND TO

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
FIGURE OUT HOW SHE CAN

13:21.000 --> 13:21.000
SUCCESSFULLY PULL OFF A SEGMENT

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
IN WHICH A CHILD MAKES A

13:23.000 --> 13:23.000
SHIRLEY TEMPLE WHILE

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
STANLEY TUCCI QUIETLY DRINKS AN

13:25.000 --> 13:25.000
ENTIRE GLASS OF WINE ON A SCREEN

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
IN THE BACKGROUND.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WORK YOUR

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
MAGIC, DREW, BUT I WANT TO

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
LEARN.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
YOU'RE ADVANCING THIS FORM!

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
SO GIVEN THAT TUCKER

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
HAS THE ADMIRATION OF

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
WHITE SUPREMACISTS, AND THE EAR

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
OF MILLIONS OF YOUR RELATIVES,

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
COWORKERS, AND ELECTED

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
OFFICIALS, WE THOUGHT, TONIGHT,

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
IT'D BE WORTH TALKING ABOUT HIM

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
-- WHERE HE CAME FROM, WHAT HIS

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
TACTICS ARE, AND WHY WHAT HE

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
REPRESENTS IS SO DANGEROUS.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
AND LET'S START WITH SOME

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
BACK STORY.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
TUCKER GREW UP IN LA JOLLA,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
CALIFORNIA, WHERE HIS DAD

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
MARRIED AN HEIRESS TO THE

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
SWANSON TV DINNER FORTUNE.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
WHICH IS ALREADY INTERESTING.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
BECAUSE IF TUCKER'S GOT SAD

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
'70s SINGLE MAN FROZEN FOOD

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
MONEY, THAT MEANS HE'S BEEN

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
DOING GROUNDBREAKING SHOWS LIKE

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
"CUCKOLDING IS WHEN A HUMILIATED

14:02.000 --> 14:02.000
MAN WATCHES HIS WIFE HAVE AN

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
AFFAIR" FOR THE LOVE OF THE

14:04.000 --> 14:04.000
GAME.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
TO HEAR TUCKER TELL IT, HE GREW

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
UP IN A SIMPLER, BETTER TIME.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
HE ONCE WISTFULLY CLAIMED,

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
"RACIAL SOLIDARITY WASN'T

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
A WORKING CONCEPT IN MY

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA HOMETOWN.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
MOST PEOPLE BARELY HAD LAST

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
NAMES, MUCH LESS ETHNIC

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
IDENTITIES."

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
WHICH IS A PRETTY WEIRD THING TO

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
SAY IF YOUR FULL NAME IS

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
TUCKER SWANSON McNEAR CARLSON,

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
AND YOUR ETHNIC IDENTITY CAN

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
BEST BE DESCRIBED AS

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
"MY BROTHER'S NAME IS

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
BUCKLEY SWANSON PECK CARLSON."

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
THE ONLY WAY HE COULD GET ANY

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
MORE ETHNICALLY WHITE IS IF HE

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
JIZZED MAYONNAISE.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
AS A CHILD, TUCKER WAS SENT TO

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
BOARDING SCHOOL, WHERE HE

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
PROMPTLY DID TWO THINGS:

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
FAIL TO IMPRESS ANY NUMBER OF

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES AND

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
START DATING THE HEADMASTER'S

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
DAUGHTER, A HEADMASTER WHO IN

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
RETURN, ARRANGED TO GET HIM

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
INTO TRINITY COLLEGE.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
HE THEN BECAME A PRINT

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
JOURNALIST, REPORTEDLY AFTER HIS

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
FATHER TOLD HIM THAT JOURNALISM

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
WILL "TAKE ANYBODY."

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
WHICH, TO HIS DAD'S CREDIT,

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
DID KIND OF TURN OUT TO BE TRUE.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
TUCKER'S LEAP TO TV, THOUGH,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
CAME AS AN ACCIDENT --

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
SUPPOSEDLY, BACK IN THE '90s,

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
DAN RATHER'S SHOW CALLED

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
THE MAGAZINE WHERE TUCKER WAS

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
WORKING, LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
TO TALK ABOUT THE O.J. TRIAL.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
AND THE RECEPTIONIST THERE TOLD

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
HIM, "EVERYONE ELSE IS STILL AT

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
LUNCH.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
CAN YOU DO IT?"

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
WHICH MIGHT BE THE SINGLE

15:09.000 --> 15:09.000
WHITEST ORIGIN STORY I HAVE EVER

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
HEARD.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
"HEY, YOU!

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
YEAH, YOU WITH THE SKIN AND

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
FACE!

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
WE'VE GOT AN EXTRA CAREER LYING

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
AROUND.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
ARE YOU INTERESTED?"

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
BUT DESPITE HIS TOTAL LACK OF

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
PREPARATION, TUCKER WAS ALMOST

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
IMMEDIATELY HITTING ON THEMES

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
THAT HE'D BE ECHOING FOR THE

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
NEXT 25 YEARS.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
BECAUSE HERE'S ONE OF HIS VERY

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
FIRST TV APPEARANCES, IN THE

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
AFTERMATH OF THE O.J. VERDICT.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
>> LET ME ASK YOU, MR. CARLSON,

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
DO YOU THINK WE'RE HONEST WITH

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
EACH OTHER?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
>> OH, NO, OF COURSE NOT.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY IS

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
TERRIFIED OF -- OF ONE THING.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
YOU KNOW, WHITES ARE, OF COURSE,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
TERRIFIED OF BEING CALLED A

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
RACIST.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
BLACKS ARE TERRIFIED OF BEING

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
BELITTLED.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
OF COURSE.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
I -- I -- I THINK WE NEED --

15:45.000 --> 15:45.000
ACTUALLY PROBABLY LESS

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
I THINK IT MIGHT DO US GOOD

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
WERE WE TO IGNORE THE SUBJECT

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
A LITTLE BIT AND TREAT EACH

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
OTHER AS IF THERE WERE NO COLOR

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
BOUNDARY SEPARATING US.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
I THINK WE TALK ABOUT IT IN SOME

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
WAYS TOO MUCH.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, I'M PRETTY

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
SURE BLACK PEOPLE ARE LESS

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
TERRIFIED OF BEING "BELITTLED"

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
THAN OF BEING KILLED, JAILED,

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
ECONOMICALLY EXPLOITED, OR

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
INDEED, DENIED ACCESS TO

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
HEALTHCARE AFTER THEIR HEADS

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
LITERALLY EXPLODE FROM HEARING

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
SOMEONE IN A BOW TIE AND PLAID

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
BLAZER SUGGEST BEING CALLED

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
RACIST IS AS BAD AS ACTUALLY

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
EXPERIENCING RACISM.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
ALTHOUGH, I DO WANT TO QUICKLY

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
COME BACK TO THAT SPECIFIC

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
BOW TIE.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
BECAUSE, LOOK, I'M NOT KNOCKING

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
BOW TIES IN GENERAL.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
THEY'RE PERFECTLY FINE FOR

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
A CHILD ATTENDING HIS FIRST

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
COMMUNION, OR A HANNA-BARBERA

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
ANIMATOR WHO CAN'T DRAW NECKS --

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
BUT THAT BOW TIE IS TOO SMALL.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
EITHER COMMIT TO IT OR

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
DON'T, TUCKER.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
DON'T JUST PUT ON A TINY ONE AND

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
HOPE NO ONE NOTICES.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
NOW, FROM THERE, TUCKER BOUNCED

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
AROUND A BIT, WITH CANCELED

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
SHOWS ON BOTH CNN AND MSNBC.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
ALTHOUGH IN HIS TIME AT CNN, HE

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
DID MANAGE TO PRODUCE -- AND I

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
DON'T SAY THIS LIGHTLY -- THE

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
MOST 2003 CLIP OF ALL TIME.

16:48.000 --> 16:48.000
>> YOU WORKED WITH PEPSI

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
FOR A LONG TIME.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
CANDIDLY, JUST BETWEEN YOU AND

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
ME, HOW MUCH PEPSI DO YOU THINK

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
YOU DRINK ON AN AVERAGE DAY?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
>> I REALLY DO LIKE PEPSI.

16:55.000 --> 16:55.000
>> REALLY?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
>> I REALLY DO.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
>> WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE KIND?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
>> MY FAVORITE KIND OF PEPSI?

16:58.000 --> 16:58.000
PEPSI'S PEPSI.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
>> WELL, YOU DON'T DRINK

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
DIET PEPSI OR --

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
>> NO, JUST -- JUST REG -- JUST

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
REG -- REGULAR PEPSI.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
>> John: LOOK, I CANNOT STRESS

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
THIS ENOUGH:

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE!

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
DON'T DO GOTCHA JOURNALISM ABOUT

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
HER PEPSI CONSUMPTION -- NOT

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
ONLY HAS SHE BEEN THROUGH A LOT,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
SHE'S A STONE COLD LEGEND.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
SHE'S THE DEFINITIONAL DIVA OF

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
THE 2000s, AND I GUARANTEE YOU:

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
THERE ISN'T A HUMAN BEING ON

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
EARTH WHO DOESN'T PERK UP WHEN

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
THAT VIOLIN HOOK FROM "TOXIC"

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
COMES ON.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
♪ ♪

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
EXACTLY!

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
PUT SOME MOTHERFUCKING RESPECT

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
ON HER NAME, TUCKER, AND -- OF

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
COURSE -- #FreeBritney.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
AND WHILE TUCKER EVENTUALLY

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
FAILED UPWARDS INTO

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
A PRIMETIME FOX SHOW IN 2016,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
THE FASCINATING THING IS,

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
IF YOU GO BACK AND WATCH HIS

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
EARLIER CLIPS, YOU CAN SEE HIM

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
LEARNING THE TRICKS OF HIS

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
TRADE, RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
WATCH HIM TALK ABOUT

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
PAT BUCHANAN -- THE REPUBLICAN

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
FIRE-BRAND AND NOTED

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
ANTI-IMMIGRANT CRUSADER -- AND

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
BREAK DOWN ONE OF BUCHANAN'S

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
GO-TO MOVES, WITH THE PRECISION

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
OF A DEDICATED STUDENT.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
>> I MEAN, PAT DOES RAISE ISSUES

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
UNFORTUNATELY, PAT BUCHANAN

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
RAISES THEM IN A WAY THAT I

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
THINK IS DISCREDITED AND WHEN

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
ATTACKED, HE CAN ALWAYS FALL

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
BACK ON THE LINE, "WELL, THE --

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
YOU KNOW, THE TINY CABAL THAT

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
CONTROLS AMERICAN POLITICS

18:09.000 --> 18:09.000
DOESN'T LIKE ME BECAUSE I SPEAK

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
TRUTH TO POWER."

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
THIS IS ACTUALLY INCIDENTALLY

18:13.000 --> 18:13.000
ALMOST VERBATIM WHAT HE SAID THE

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
OTHER DAY, "THAT I OFFEND THE

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
PLUTOCRACY, THAT I'M A WANTED

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
MAN BY THE INSIDE THE BELTWAY

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
PEOPLE," AND IN EVERY SENSE,

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
CAST HIMSELF AS A -- AS A VICTIM

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
WHO WAS SORT OF A KAREN SILKWOOD

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
OF POLITICS, SOMEONE WHO'S SO

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
TRUTHFUL THAT HE'S BEING HUNTED

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
DOWN BY THE -- BY THE CONSPIRACY

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
THAT RUNS WASHINGTON.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I MEAN, IT'S ALL A BIT MUCH.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
>> John: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
TUCKER -- IT IS!

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
AND THAT IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY

18:41.000 --> 18:41.000
SALIENT POINT, IT'S JUST

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
INCREDIBLY HARD TO TAKE,

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
GIVEN WHO'S MAKING IT.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
IN THE SAME WAY IT WOULD BE HARD

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
TO LISTEN TO A LECTURE ON GUN

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
SAFETY AND OVERALL LIFE CHOICES

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
FROM TEKASHI69.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I DON'T CARE HOW GOOD YOUR

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
ADVICE IS.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
I'M NOT TAKING IT FROM YOU.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
BECAUSE "THE TINY CABAL THAT

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
CONTROLS AMERICAN POLITICS

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
DOESN'T LIKE ME BECAUSE I SPEAK

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
TRUTH TO POWER" IS NOW TUCKER'S

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
SIGNATURE MOVE.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
HE DOES IT ALL THE TIME,

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
WHENEVER HE'S CRITICIZED.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
A FEW YEARS AGO, HE LOST

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
ADVERTISERS AFTER SAYING, AND I

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
QUOTE, THAT IMMIGRANTS MAKE OUR

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
COUNTRY "POORER AND DIRTIER AND

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
MORE DIVIDED."

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
AND THIS IS HOW HE FIRED BACK.

19:15.000 --> 19:15.000
>> THOSE WHO WON'T SHUT UP GET

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
SILENCED.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
YOU'VE SEEN IT A MILLION TIMES.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
THE ENFORCERS SCREAM, "RACIST,"

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
ON TWITTER UNTIL EVERYBODY GETS

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
INTIMIDATED.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
IT'S A TACTIC, A WELL-WORN ONE.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
NOBODY THINKS IT'S REAL.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
AND IT WON'T WORK WITH THIS

19:28.000 --> 19:28.000
SHOW.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
WE'RE NOT INTIMIDATED.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
WE PLAN TO TRY TO SAY WHAT'S

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
TRUE UNTIL THE LAST DAY.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
AND THE TRUTH IS UNREGULATED

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
MASS IMMIGRATION HAS BADLY HURT

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
THIS COUNTRY'S NATURAL

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
LANDSCAPE.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
>> John: OH, FUCK OFF, TUCKER,

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
YOU RELENTLESSLY INDIGNANT

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
PICKET FENCE.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
HOW DID YOU GO FROM CRITICIZING

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
PAT BUCHANAN FOR THAT PRECISE

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
TACTIC TO BASICALLY IMITATING

19:51.000 --> 19:51.000
HIM?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
IT'S ALL -- TO BORROW A PHRASE

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
-- "A BIT MUCH."

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
BUT THAT TECHNIQUE GETS TO THE

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
ABSOLUTE HEART OF TUCKER'S SHOW:

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
SO OFTEN, HE POSITIONS HIMSELF

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
AS SOMEONE JUST ASKING THE HARD

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
QUESTIONS -- THE ONES THAT

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
"THEY" DON'T WANT YOU ASKING.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
QUESTIONS LIKE, "IS AFFIRMATIVE

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
ACTION RACIST?"

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
AND "SHOULD AMERICA BE SELECTIVE

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
WITH IMMIGRANTS?"

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
AND "HAS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
BECOME ANTI-WHITE AND

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
ANTI-MALE?"

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
JUST ASKING QUESTIONS, WHILE

20:12.000 --> 20:17.000
HEAVILY IMPLYING THAT THE ANSWER

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
TO THOSE QUESTIONS IS YES.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
BUT WHEN, IN TURN, ANYONE

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
QUESTIONS HIM, THEY'RE NOT JUST

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
CENSORING FREE SPEECH, THEY'RE

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
LAUNCHING AN ATTACK ON THE

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
FOUNDATIONS OF OUR DEMOCRACY,

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
AND THE VAST WORKING CLASS WHO

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
THIS HUMBLE TV DINNER

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
PRINCE SOMEHOW REPRESENTS.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
AND THE MOST TELLING THING ABOUT

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
TUCKER'S FRAMING OF HIMSELF AS

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
THE SCOURGE OF THE ELITES AND

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
THE HERO OF THE COMMON MAN IS

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
THAT, FOR TUCKER, WHO

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
CONSTITUTES "THE COMMON MAN" IS

20:39.000 --> 20:39.000
VERY SELECTIVE.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
TAKE ILHAN OMAR.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
JUST WATCH HIM LOSE HIS SHIT

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
OVER A CLIP HE'S ABOUT TO PLAY

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
OF SOMETHING SHE SAID.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
>> IF ANYONE SHOULD LOVE

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
AMERICA, IT'S ILHAN OMAR.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
THIS COUNTRY RESCUED HER FROM A

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
SQUALID KENYAN REFUGEE CAMP AND

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
MADE HER A NATIONAL FIGURE,

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
QUITE AN ASCENT.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
BUT ILHAN OMAR IS NOT GRATEFUL.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
SHE HATES US FOR IT.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
WATCH OMAR TELL US IT IS TIME TO

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
DISMANTLE OUR COUNTRY.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
>> AS LONG AS OUR ECONOMY AND

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
POLITICAL SYSTEMS PRIORITIZE

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
PROFIT WITHOUT CONSIDERING WHO

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
IS PROFITING, WHO IS BEING SHUT

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
OUT, WE WILL PERPETUATE THIS

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
INEQUALITY.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
SO WE CANNOT STOP AT CRIMINAL

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
WE MUST BEGIN THE WORK OF

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
DISMANTLING THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
OPPRESSION WHEREVER WE FIND IT.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
>> DISMANTLE THE AMERICAN

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
ECONOMY AND THE AMERICAN SYSTEM

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
OF GOVERNMENT, INSTITUTIONS THAT

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS BUILT

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
OVER HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
>> John: ALL RIGHT, THERE IS

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
ALREADY ENOUGH THERE IN THE

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
SNEERING CONDESCENSION THAT

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
ILHAN OMAR SHOULD BE QUIETLY

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
GRATEFUL HER ENTIRE LIFE BECAUSE

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
SHE WAS GRANTED ASYLUM WHEN SHE

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
WAS A CHILD.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
BUT LET'S JUST CONSIDER THE VAST

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
DISTANCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU JUST

21:55.000 --> 21:55.000
HEARD HER SAY AND WHAT HE SEEMED

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
TO HEAR.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO TUCKER,

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
DISMANTLING THE SYSTEM OF

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
OPPRESSION MEANS DISMANTLING

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
THE ENTIRE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
NOW, DID HE INADVERTENTLY MAKE A

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
NUANCED POINT ABOUT HOW SYSTEMIC

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
OPPRESSION IS DEFINITIONALLY

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
BAKED INTO EVERY LEVEL AND FACET

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
OF THAT VERY SAME SYSTEM?

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
YES, YES HE DID.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
AM I GOING TO GIVE HIM CREDIT

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
FOR DOING THAT?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
FUCK NO!

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
ESPECIALLY NOT WHEN THIS IS WHAT

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
HE SAID NEXT:

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
>> THE PROBLEM IS, THERE ARE

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
MANY OF US HERE WHO DO LIKE THIS

22:21.000 --> 22:21.000
COUNTRY.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
WE LIVE HERE.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
WE DON'T WANT TO DESTROY IT.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
WE HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO FIGHT TO

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
PRESERVE OUR NATION AND OUR

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
HERITAGE AND OUR CULTURE.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
>> John: WOW, "PRESERVE OUR

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
HERITAGE AND CULTURE."

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
THAT IS DIRECT.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
IN FACT, HIS PRE-WRITTEN CAPTION

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
THERE -- "WE HAVE TO FIGHT TO

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
PRESERVE OUR NATION AND

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
HERITAGE" DREW A LOT OF

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
COMPARISONS TO THE

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
"FOURTEEN WORDS," THE FAMOUS

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
WHITE SUPREMACIST SLOGAN THAT

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
SAYS, "WE MUST SECURE THE

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
EXISTENCE OF OUR PEOPLE AND

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
A FUTURE FOR WHITE CHILDREN."

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
AND WHEN YOU PUT THE TWO

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
TOGETHER, THERE IS, Y'KNOW,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
A SLIGHT SIMILARITY THERE.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I'M JUST SAYING -- IF YOU TYPED

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
TUCKER'S QUOTE INTO A BLANK WORD

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
DOCUMENT, NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN,

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
CLIPPY IS GOING TO ASK "ARE YOU

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
TRYING TO RECITE THE FOURTEEN

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
WORDS?"

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
OF COURSE, CLIPPY'S BEEN ASKING

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
THAT A LOT MORE EVER SINCE HE

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
STARTED SPENDING SO MUCH TIME ON

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
YOUTUBE.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
CAREFUL HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPEND

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
ON THERE, CLIPPY, IT'S TURNING

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
YOU INTO AN ASSHOLE.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
COME ONE, THAT SEEMS LIKE A

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
STRETCH.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
YOU CAN'T KNOW WHAT TUCKER MEANS

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
BY "OUR HERITAGE AND CULTURE,"

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT HE HASN'T

23:21.000 --> 23:21.000
ALWAYS BEEN THAT DISCIPLINED

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
ABOUT MESSAGING.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
IN THE LATE 2000s, HE USED TO

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
CALL INTO A RADIO SHOW HOSTED

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
BY SHOCK JOCK BUBBA THE LOVE

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
SPONGE.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
AND IN THOSE CALLS, THE THIN

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
VEIL COVERING HIS RACISM WOULD

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
OCCASIONALLY THROWN OFF, IN

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
MOMENTS LIKE THIS.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
>> IRAQ IS A CRAPPY PLACE FILLED

23:36.000 --> 23:36.000
WITH A BUNCH OF, YOU KNOW --

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
>> YEAH.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
>> SEMI-LITERATE PRIMITIVE

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
MONKEYS.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
BUT I JUST HAVE ZERO SYMPATHY

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
FOR THEM OR THEIR CULTURE.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
A CULTURE WHERE PEOPLE JUST

23:44.000 --> 23:44.000
DON'T USE TOILET PAPER OR

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
FORKS.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
>> John: OKAY.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
THAT ISN'T JUST INCREDIBLY

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
OFFENSIVE.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
IT'S ALSO THE KIND OF FACT-FREE

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
CULTURAL HOT TAKE THAT IS

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
THE ESSENTIAL TUCKER CARLSON

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE WHILE IT IS

23:57.000 --> 23:57.000
CLEARLY BY NO MEANS THE MOST

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
IMPORTANT THING THERE, FOR THE

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
RECORD: TABLE FORKS WERE

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
APPARENTLY FIRST USED IN THE

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
MIDDLE EAST AND BYZANTINE

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
EMPIRE, AND WERE STILL

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
"CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT" IN EUROPE

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
UNTIL CENTURIES LATER.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
IN FACT, WHEN THE NIECE OF A

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
BYZANTINE EMPEROR BROUGHT A CASE

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
OF FORKS TO VENICE FOR HER

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
WEDDING FEAST IN THE ELEVENTH

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
CENTURY, SHE WAS "ROUNDLY

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
CONDEMNED BY THE LOCAL CLERGY

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
FOR HER DECADENCE," WITH ONE

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
SAYING, "GOD IN HIS WISDOM HAS

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
PROVIDED MAN WITH NATURAL FORKS:

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
HIS FINGERS.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
THEREFORE, IT IS AN INSULT TO

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
HIM TO SUBSTITUTE ARTIFICIAL

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
METAL FORKS FOR THEM WHEN

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
EATING."

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A FULL

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
REFUTATION OF TUCKER'S LAZY

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
RACISM, IT'S ALSO A VERY FUN

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
FORK FACT.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
>> FORK FACT!

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
>> John: FORK FACTS ARE FUN!

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
THE POINT IS, WHEN YOU KNOW HOW

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
TUCKER SPEAKS WHEN HE SPEAKS

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
FREELY, THE FILTER THROUGH WHICH

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
HE PROCESSES THE WORLD FOR HIS

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
AUDIENCE BECOMES PAINFULLY

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
APPARENT.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
BECAUSE HE'S SMART ENOUGH NOT TO

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
OPENLY SAY INTO A CAMERA THAT

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
CERTAIN RACES ARE MORE DESERVING

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
OF SCORN, OR LESS WORTHY OF

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
RESPECT.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
HE WILL JUST HEAVILY IMPLY THAT,

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
DEPENDING ON WHO HE'S TALKING

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
ABOUT.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
TAKE THE CAPITOL RIOTS.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
TUCKER SAID THAT HE DEPLORED

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
THE VIOLENCE, BUT REPEATEDLY

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
COMPELLED HIS VIEWERS TO TRY AND

25:04.000 --> 25:11.000
UNDERSTAND WHERE THE PEOPLE

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
DEMONSTRATORS WERE COMING FROM.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
>> ON JANUARY 6TH, WE HAD A RIOT

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
AT THE U.S. CAPITOL.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
WHY DID THAT HAPPEN?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
IT HAPPENED BECAUSE MILLIONS OF

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
AMERICAN VOTERS WERE CONVINCED

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
THAT THE LAST ELECTION WAS NOT

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
FAIR.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
WHERE DID THEY GET THAT IDEA?

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
WELL, IT WASN'T SIMPLY BECAUSE

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
THE LAST PRESIDENT TOLD THEM SO,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
YOU'RE HEARING THAT NOW AS IF

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
THEY ARE ANIMALS WHO TAKE

25:25.000 --> 25:25.000
COMMANDS AND DO WHAT THEY'RE

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
TOLD, BUT THEY'RE NOT ANIMALS.

25:27.000 --> 25:27.000
THEY ARE PEOPLE.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
COME TO THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
ABOUT IT.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
THEY SAW THE RADICAL INCREASE IN

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
MAIL-IN VOTING, MILLIONS DID,

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
AND IT CORRODED THEIR FAITH AND

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
THE PUBLIC'S FAITH IN OUR

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
SYSTEMS OF ELECTION.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
>> John: OKAY, HOLD ON.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK THE ELECTION

25:45.000 --> 25:45.000
WAS RIGGED BECAUSE THEY SAW AN

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
"INCREASE IN MAIL-IN VOTING."

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
THEY THOUGHT THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
LIKE YOU REPEATEDLY TOLD THEM

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
AND THAT PLEA FOR UNDERSTANDING

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
THERE IS ESPECIALLY HARD TO TAKE

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
WHEN YOU CONTRAST IT WITH HOW

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
HE REACTED TO LAST SUMMER'S

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTS.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
>> PEOPLE LIKE THIS DON'T BOTHER

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
TO WORK.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
THEY DON'T VOLUNTEER OR

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
PAY TAXES TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
THEY LIVE FOR THEMSELVES.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
THEY DO EXACTLY WHAT THEY

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
FEEL LIKE DOING.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
THEY SAY EXACTLY WHAT THEY

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
FEEL LIKE SAYING.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
THEY SPRAY PAINT THEIR OPINIONS

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
ON BUILDINGS.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
ON TELEVISION, HOUR BY HOUR,

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
WE WATCH THESE PEOPLE,

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
CRIMINAL MOBS, DESTROY WHAT

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
THE REST OF US HAVE BUILT.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO THAT.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
THEY DON'T CONTRIBUTE TO THE

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
COMMON GOOD.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
THEY NEVER HAVE.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
YET, SUDDENLY THEY SEEM TO HAVE

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
ALL THE POWER.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
>> John: WELL, THAT'S QUITE

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
A DIFFERENT TONE.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
AND IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE WHO

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
GETS TO BE "AMERICAN CITIZENS

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
WHO CAME TO THEIR OWN

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
CONCLUSIONS," AND WHO GETS TO BE

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
"CRIMINAL MOBS WHO DESTROY WHAT

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
THE REST OF US HAVE BUILT."

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
DIVIDING LINE FOR TUCKER ON THAT

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
QUESTION IS, "HOW EASILY CAN YOU

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
SUNBURN?"

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
AND LOOK, MY POINT HERE ISN'T

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
THAT TUCKER IS INCONSISTENT, IN

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
ADDRESSING TWO VIOLENT PROTESTS

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
IN VASTLY DIFFERENT WAYS.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
IT'S THAT HE'S ACTUALLY

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
INCREDIBLY CONSISTENT, BECAUSE

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
IN BOTH INSTANCES, HIS CLEAR

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
TAKEAWAY IS THAT WHITE PEOPLE

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
SHOULD BE TERRIFIED AT THE IDEA

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
OF ANY SITUATION WHERE THEY

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
AREN'T IN POWER.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
THE MAIN NARRATIVE OF TUCKER'S

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
SHOW IS THAT POWER IS BEING

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
TAKEN AWAY FROM "YOU," HIS

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
VIEWER -- AND THAT THIS NEEDS TO

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
BE RESISTED.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
HE'S RUN SEGMENTS -- JUST ASKING

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
QUESTIONS, REMEMBER -- LIKE,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
"HOW EXACTLY IS DIVERSITY OUR

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
STRENGTH?"

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
AND HAS ARGUED NOT JUST THAT IT

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
ISN'T, BUT THAT IT'S A "THREAT

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
TO OUR EXISTENCE AS A COHESIVE

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
COUNTRY."

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
IN FACT, HE'LL OFTEN CALL TO

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
RESIST THAT THREAT WITH AN

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
INTERESTING CHOICE OF PHRASE.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
>> WESTERN CIVILIZATION

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
IS OUR BIRTHRIGHT.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
IT MAKES ALL GOOD THINGS

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
POSSIBLE.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
UNDEFENDED, IT COLLAPSES.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
AND SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
TO PRESERVE IT.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
>> IT'S A WAR, WITH ONE SIDE

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
TRYING TO ERASE ALL REMNANTS OF

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
ITS OPPONENT.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
IN THIS CASE,

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
WESTERN CIVILIZATION.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
>> IS THE CULTURE INTO WHICH

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
THEY'RE COMING, THE WESTERN

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
CIVILIZATION WE'RE TALKING

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
ABOUT, SUPERIOR TO THE CULTURE

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
THAT THESE IMMIGRANTS ARE

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
BRINGING?

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
>> DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
MOVE A LARGE MUSLIM POPULATION

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
INTO THE WEST AND SUCCESSFULLY

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
INTEGRATE THEM INTO WESTERN

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
CULTURE?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT ANYWHERE?

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
>> John: YEAH, FOR TUCKER,

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
IT SEEMS WESTERN CIVILIZATION IS

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
SOMEHOW BOTH THE MIGHTY AND

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
ESSENTIAL BEDROCK ON WHICH ALL

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
MODERN HUMAN EXISTENCE IS BUILT,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
AND ALSO, A DELICATE HOUSE OF

28:15.000 --> 28:15.000
CARDS THAT WILL COLLAPSE IF YOU

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
SO MUCH AS LOOK AT IT WRONG.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
AND AGAIN, HE'LL BE CAREFUL NOT

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
TO VERBALLY LINK RACE AND

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
CIVILIZATION, LIKE HE'S CALLING

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
IN TO A LOVE SPONGE'S RADIO SHOW

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
IN 2006.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
BUT HE WILL OCCASIONALLY DANCE

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
INCREDIBLY CLOSE TO IT.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
>> LET ME JUST STIPULATE.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
I AM FOR GETTING ALONG.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I AM FOR COLORBLINDNESS,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I'M FOR TOLERANCE, 100%.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IF THINGS

28:36.000 --> 28:36.000
RADICALLY CHANGE IN YOUR

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
COUNTRY, IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
SAY, WHAT IS THIS, AND MAYBE I

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY

28:40.000 --> 28:40.000
THAT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
COUNTRY I GREW UP IN.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
IS THAT BIGOTED?

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
>> John: UH, YEAH.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
YEAH, IT IS.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
THAT'S LIKE SAYING, "I'VE GOT

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
TEN FINGERS AND TOES, A POINTY

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
FACE WITH A LITTLE PINK ROSEBUD

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
MOUTH, A CAT-SIZED BODY, A LONG

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
WEIRD TAIL, AND I EAT GARBAGE.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
DOES THAT MAKE ME A POSSUM?"

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
YES!

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
YES, IT DOES!

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
THAT'S THE LITERAL DEFINITION OF

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
THE THING YOU JUST DESCRIBED!

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
AND THAT IS THE WHOLE THING WITH

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
TUCKER.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
HE MIGHT NOT SAY "BLACK" OR

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
"WHITE," HE'LL INSIST HE'S

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
"FOR COLORBLINDNESS," HE'LL

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
BUILD IN DENIABILITY BY PHRASING

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
THINGS AS A QUESTION -- LIKE,

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
WHAT DOES RACISM LOOK LIKE?

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
WHILE KIND OF EMBODYING THE

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
ANSWER.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
BUT WHEN YOU PUT ALL OF THIS

29:17.000 --> 29:17.000
TOGETHER, THE PATTERN IS CLEAR:

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
HE'S SCARED OF A COUNTRY THAT

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
"LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE ONE HE

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
GREW UP IN," BECAUSE DIVERSITY

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
ISN'T OUR STRENGTH, IMMIGRANTS

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
MAKE OUR COUNTRY POORER,

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
DIRTIER, AND MORE DIVIDED,

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
AND ANY ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THAT

29:27.000 --> 29:27.000
CULTURE IS AN ATTACK ON

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
WESTERN CIVILIZATION.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
ALL OF WHICH IS A LONG WAY OF

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
SAYING THAT WHEN TUCKER ASKS,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
"WHAT IS WHITE SUPREMACY?"

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
THE ANSWER IS BASICALLY THAT.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
IT'S A BELIEF THAT, IN A COUNTRY

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
WHERE WHITE PEOPLE ARE DOMINANT,

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
THAT'S ALL DOWN TO THEIR NATURAL

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
AND INNATE ABILITIES, AND ANY

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
EFFORT TO CHANGE THAT IS AN

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
AFFRONT TO THE NATURAL ORDER OF

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
THINGS.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
SO IT'S FRANKLY NO WONDER THAT

29:52.000 --> 29:52.000
GUY'S FAMILY WATCHES TUCKER

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
TWICE A NIGHT.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
OF COURSE TUCKER'S BEEN ENDORSED

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS.

29:57.000 --> 29:57.000
JAMES ALLSUP -- A FAR-RIGHT

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
ACTIVIST WHO MARCHED IN

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
CHARLOTTESVILLE -- ONCE SAID

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
THIS TO A CONFERENCE ROOM FULL

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
OF FELLOW WHITE SUPREMACISTS.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
>> AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
ENGAGING IN VERY EFFECTIVE

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
RHETORIC IS, OF COURSE,

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
TUCKER CARLSON.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
TUCKER IS HELPING MAINSTREAM

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
CONSERVATIVES CHANGE THE WAY

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
THEY THINK ABOUT POLITICS AND

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
CAUSING A MASSIVE SWATH OF

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
TRUMP VOTERS TO LOOK DEEPER

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
INTO MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
WE ALREADY TALK ABOUT.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
THE LEFT IS AWARE OF WHAT HE'S

30:21.000 --> 30:21.000
DOING AND HE'S AWARE OF WHAT

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
HE'S DOING, SO IT WORKS

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
PHENOMENALLY.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
[LAUGHTER]

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
>> John: OH, THAT MIGHT BE THE

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
SINGLE WORST LAUGH I'VE EVER

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
HEARD.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
AND I SAY THAT AS SOMEONE WHO'S

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
ALMOST FORGOTTEN WHAT HUMAN

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
LAUGHTER SOUNDS LIKE.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
I'VE BEEN STUCK INSIDE CASPER'S

30:39.000 --> 30:39.000
ASSHOLE FOR 12 LONG MONTHS NOW,

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
AND I'M SO DESPERATE TO HEAR THE

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
RESPONSE OF A LIVE AUDIENCE,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
BUT IF IT'S NEO-NAZI CHUCKLES,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
PINGPONGING OFF THE WALLS OF A

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
HOTEL BALLROOM,

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
I THINK I MIGHT BE OUT.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
AND LOOK, IF EVERYTHING I'VE

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
SHOWN YOU SOMEHOW STILL ISN'T

30:53.000 --> 30:53.000
ENOUGH -- LET'S HEAR FROM A

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
LITERAL FORMER GRAND WIZARD OF

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
WHITE SUPREMACISTS, DAVID DUKE.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
HE'S NOT ONLY TWEETED

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
APPROVINGLY ABOUT TUCKER IN THE

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
PAST, SAYING, "TUCKER IS RIGHT!"

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
AND "CAN'T CUCK THE TUCK!"

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
-- WHICH, AS ALL TUCKER VIEWERS

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
KNOW, REFERS TO WHEN A

31:06.000 --> 31:06.000
HUMILIATED MAN WATCHES

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
HIS WIFE HAVE AN AFFAIR.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
DUKE EVEN HAS A PODCAST,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
WHERE HE SOMETIMES JUST RECAPS

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
TUCKER'S SEGMENTS FROM THE NIGHT

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
BEFORE.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
LAST YEAR, WHEN ENDORSING TRUMP

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
FOR PRESIDENT, HE EVEN SUGGESTED

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
THAT TUCKER CARLSON SHOULD BE

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
HIS V.P., EXPLAINING TUCKER'S

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
VALUE TO THE WHITE SUPREMACIST

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
CAUSE LIKE THIS.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
>> HE DOESN'T USE THE WORD

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
"WHITE" VERY OFTEN, BUT THAT'S

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
THE UNDERLYING MESSAGE THAT HE'S

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
SHOWING.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
AND HE SHOWS THAT THERE IS

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
MASSIVE RACISM IN AMERICA

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE, WHILE AT

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
THE SAME TIME SAYING THERE'S NO

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
SYSTEMATIC RACISM.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
BUT PEOPLE GET THE MESSAGE.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
>> John: YEAH, PEOPLE DO GET THE

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
MESSAGE.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, IT'S NOT

31:41.000 --> 31:41.000
LIKE IT'S WRITTEN IN A COMPLEX

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
CODE.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
IT'S A WALKING YACHT CLUB

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
SCRUNCHING HIS FACE UP FOR AN

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
HOUR EVERY NIGHT AND SAYING TO

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
THE SPHINX TERRITORY HERE.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
AND ALL OF THIS IS WHY -- AS

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
TEMPTING AS IT IS TO DISMISS THE

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
CONTROVERSY THAT FOLLOWS TUCKER

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
EVERY WEEK AS ONE MORE ARTIFACT

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
OF OUR OUTRAGE CULTURE -- IT'S

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT WHAT

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
TUCKER IS SAYING IS FUCKING

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
OUTRAGEOUS.

32:09.000 --> 32:09.000
BECAUSE NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
MIND WOULD SIT DOWN, POP IN

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
THEIR HEADPHONES, FIRE UP

DAVID DUKE'S PODCAST AND THINK,

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
"HEY, I'M NOT

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
A WHITE SUPREMACIST."

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
BUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WATCH

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
TUCKER ON TV EVERY NIGHT,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
SPOUTING WELL-LAUNDERED VERSIONS

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
POINTS, AND THERE IS REAL HARM

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
IN THAT.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
BECAUSE WHILE WHITE SUPREMACY IS

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
CLEARLY DANGEROUS WHEN PROMOTED

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
BY SELF-AVOWED WHITE

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
