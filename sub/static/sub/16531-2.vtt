00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.739
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.178
Previously on Empire...
ANDRE:
Rhonda!

00:10.211 --> 00:11.579
(sobbing):
Andre messed up.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.414
Andre did mess up.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.549
What's your half brother Tariq
doing here?

00:15.583 --> 00:16.650
I know Lucious married Anika

00:16.684 --> 00:18.018
just to keep her
from testifying.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.087
If I can prove
that the marriage

00:19.120 --> 00:20.688
is fake, I can subpoena her.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.890
I know we're still good
as long as I see

00:22.923 --> 00:24.358
that fire in your eye.
What me and you had

00:24.392 --> 00:25.859
is dead.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.061
(breathing heavily)

00:27.095 --> 00:29.163
COOKIE:
Get yourself together.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.765
She is out there
taking your song.

00:31.799 --> 00:34.568
LUCIOUS:
We're gonna show
all these haters

00:34.602 --> 00:36.204
how dark hell can get.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.039
(doorbell chimes)

00:43.877 --> 00:45.879
(doorbell chimes)

00:48.382 --> 00:49.583
(doorbell chimes)

00:49.617 --> 00:51.085
*

00:54.622 --> 00:55.889
Thanks.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.232
(doorbell chimes)

01:08.269 --> 01:09.503
Thank you.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.881
PORSHA:
Cookie!

01:20.914 --> 01:22.816
Cookie, you gotta come see this,
Cookie!

01:22.850 --> 01:24.518
Would you shut up
all that noi...

01:26.520 --> 01:27.788
Oh, hell no.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.056
Uh-uh. Out.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.324
Take it out. All of it.

01:30.358 --> 01:31.159
What?

01:31.192 --> 01:32.393
Take it out.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.927
All right, get it,
get it out of here.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.329
You sure?
All of it?

01:35.363 --> 01:36.664
We can't keep
the espresso machine,

01:36.697 --> 01:38.098
a couple Jimmy Choos
or nothing?

01:38.132 --> 01:39.800
Out! All of it!

01:39.833 --> 01:41.902
That damn Lucious
needs to stop.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.437
I'm done with his ass.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.473
*

01:52.713 --> 01:54.148
WOMAN: Mm-hmm.
ANIKA: Um...

01:54.182 --> 01:55.916
Bella's a preemie,
and so she's gonna need

01:55.949 --> 01:57.151
some specific
attention.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.652
WOMAN:
Yes.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.488
How do you handle
stressful situations?

02:00.521 --> 02:02.990
Well, I assess
the baby's needs.

02:03.023 --> 02:06.494
Does she need to be fed,
or burped,

02:06.527 --> 02:08.996
or should I pick her up and...
LUCIOUS:
Wait. Hold on, hold on.

02:09.029 --> 02:10.431
Who in the hell are
all these people in my house?

02:10.464 --> 02:12.132
Oh, my God.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.301
Up, up, up, up, up.
Out. Come on.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.535
I'm sorry,
the interview's over.

02:14.568 --> 02:15.969
Out. Ladies!

02:16.003 --> 02:18.038
Ladies! Out!
I don't need a nanny.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.540
(Anika sighs)
LUCIOUS:
I said go!

02:19.573 --> 02:21.509
Lucious...
Get the hell out of here.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.244
Come on!

02:24.745 --> 02:27.615
Who gave you the permission
to hire a nanny?

02:27.648 --> 02:29.550
I need permission?

02:29.583 --> 02:30.818
In my house, you do.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.052
Or have you forgotten

02:32.085 --> 02:33.521
that the only reason you in here

02:33.554 --> 02:36.156
is because of that damn
federal investigation?

02:36.190 --> 02:37.658
I don't need people I don't know

02:37.691 --> 02:39.159
looking in my life, okay?

02:39.193 --> 02:40.394
(Bella crying)

02:40.428 --> 02:41.795
Oh, my God, Lucious,

02:41.829 --> 02:43.364
I need help.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.132
Okay? I cannot
do this by myself!

02:45.165 --> 02:47.868
I took care of Dwight
all on my own.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.136
I'll get Bella.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.504
No!

02:50.538 --> 02:51.972
You keep your crazy hands

02:52.005 --> 02:53.674
off of my baby.
You know what you're gonna do?

02:53.707 --> 02:55.042
You got one job
in this house,

02:55.075 --> 02:56.477
and that's a mother.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.746
Get in there and
do your damn job.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.014
(Bella continues crying)

03:01.048 --> 03:03.150
ANGELA YEE:
And we are back, peoples.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.518
And today we've got

03:04.552 --> 03:06.654
Jamal Lyon and City Councilman

03:06.687 --> 03:08.322
Angelo Dubois
in the building

03:08.356 --> 03:10.491
and we're talking about
violence in hip hop.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.726
Now, there's a question
that we've all been

03:12.760 --> 03:15.396
dancing around,
so I gotta ask:

03:15.429 --> 03:18.832
Jamal, at the Empire XStream
launch party, what happened?

03:18.866 --> 03:21.535
It looked like you
froze up onstage.
JAMAL:
No, I didn't freeze up.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.437
That's not what happened.
Well, was it something

03:23.471 --> 03:25.706
to do with you getting shot?
Because...

03:25.739 --> 03:27.708
PTSD is nothing to be
ashamed of, brother.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.344
I'm sorry?
Posttraumatic
stress disorder.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.579
You see, these

03:31.612 --> 03:32.846
African-American men, uh,

03:32.880 --> 03:34.615
they're the primary victims

03:34.648 --> 03:36.517
in gun violence
and they come from a culture...

03:36.550 --> 03:38.519
I-I'm sorry, I'm just gonna
jump in right there.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.220
With all due respect,

03:40.254 --> 03:41.622
you're not a doctor, Councilman,

03:41.655 --> 03:42.890
so please do not diagnose me.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.758
And-and furthermore,
as far as

03:44.792 --> 03:47.295
"victim" goes, I'm not that.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.563
If anybody's a victim,
it's actually Freda Gatz.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.964
ANGELO:
All right, well,

03:50.998 --> 03:53.033
then who put the gun
in her hands?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.802
YEE: Well, Councilman Dubois
has a point, now.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.203
How is Freda Gatz the victim?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.204
Well, then, why don't we all try

03:57.237 --> 03:58.272
to grow up where she grew up?

03:58.306 --> 04:00.474
See, it's that line of thinking

04:00.508 --> 04:01.809
that does a tremendous
disservice to black folk.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.243
Wait, I'm sorry.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.546
What-what country are we
living in? "Disservice"?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.247
It's actually not thinking;
it's a fact, Councilman.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.283
Urban, young, black children

04:09.317 --> 04:11.985
deal with poverty and racism,

04:12.019 --> 04:14.121
oppression from police
brutality itself,

04:14.154 --> 04:15.656
mass incarceration,
so how...
Understandable.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.991
How are we supposed to deal
with these circumstances

04:18.025 --> 04:19.427
if we marginalize
ourselves?

04:19.460 --> 04:21.094
Hmm.
I'll tell you how.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.563
Education.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.931
Opportunity.

04:23.964 --> 04:27.234
See, this is
what we promote

04:27.267 --> 04:29.269
in our program WOKE, all right?

04:29.303 --> 04:32.105
We Organize for Knowledge
and Empowerment.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.074
Well, Councilman,
why don't you tell Jamal Lyon

04:34.107 --> 04:36.477
how WOKE is taking on
racism and oppression?

04:36.510 --> 04:37.745
I have a better idea.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.780
Why doesn't Jamal
come and visit

04:39.813 --> 04:42.650
one of our anti-violence
summits this week?

04:42.683 --> 04:44.318
(mouthing)

04:47.688 --> 04:49.523
Come through, we'd love
to have you, sir.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.325
I'd love to.
I'm there.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.793
All right, yeah.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.162
Hmm.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.296
Jamal, what the hell
is wrong with you?

04:56.330 --> 04:57.297
Agreeing to do
some stupid summit

04:57.331 --> 04:59.367
with that bougie bitch.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.801
He wouldn't know the streets

05:00.834 --> 05:02.636
if it shot him in the ass.
Lord, I know, Ma.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.204
But you know what?
He was making sense
and you know it.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.640
You know, what you need to be
doing is making new music.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.942
See, doing that radio station
was just damage control.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.879
You need to get your ass back
onstage and prove to your fans

05:11.912 --> 05:13.514
that that brain fart
was a one-time thing.
Ma...
Ma, Ma...

05:13.547 --> 05:14.782
Excuse me, Mrs. Lyon...

05:14.815 --> 05:16.684
Ms. Lyon.
Ms. Lyon.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.285
Are you joining us
at the summit?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.454
No, I'm busy,
and so is Jamal.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.122
I guess he forgot
to tell you

05:22.155 --> 05:23.991
he's in the studio
all week.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.394
That's too bad.
The kids are huge fans of yours.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.661
As a matter of fact,

05:27.695 --> 05:29.697
they started
Snapchatting already.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.499
There we go.
Wow.

05:31.532 --> 05:32.900
ANGELO:
That one's Isaiah.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.535
He's a, uh,
he's a shining star.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.837
Mm-hmm.
Look, you know what?

05:36.870 --> 05:38.472
I'm-I'm gonna figure out
my schedule.

05:38.506 --> 05:39.707
You know, I'm not
gonna let them down.

05:39.740 --> 05:40.974
That would be great.
I appreciate that,

05:41.008 --> 05:42.075
from both of you.
Yeah, yeah.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.210
Mm-hmm.
We gotta go.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.211
I look forward
to seeing you both there.

05:44.244 --> 05:45.479
Uh-huh, bye-bye.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.214
Why you gotta
be so rude?

05:47.247 --> 05:49.249
'Cause we got
a FBI agent up our ass.

05:49.282 --> 05:50.684
We don't need
a politician, too.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.152
That man was being
so polite.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.421
I don't trust polite people,
stupid.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.394
LUCIOUS:
My Empire XStream launch

06:00.428 --> 06:02.763
might have had some difficulties

06:02.796 --> 06:05.332
had you not done
what you did.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.435
I mean, nobody's even
talking about Jamal.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.269
All anybody can talk about--

06:09.302 --> 06:11.338
the press and me alike--

06:11.371 --> 06:13.707
is this rare talent

06:13.741 --> 06:15.743
that just blew everybody away.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.611
SHINE:
You shouldn't have cut me off.

06:17.645 --> 06:20.914
We could've been making millions
with Nessa a long time ago.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.116
What I want to know is,
what do you want to do next?

06:23.150 --> 06:24.785
What's your next move?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.253
HAKEEM:
I tell you what.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.055
Me and Shine
already working on something.

06:28.088 --> 06:31.425
You know, I was thinking about
coming out with a living album,

06:31.459 --> 06:34.261
something like Yeezy with his
Life of Pablo situation.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.262
But bigger.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.564
And my homie Nessa,

06:36.597 --> 06:37.598
she gonna
help me do it,

06:37.631 --> 06:39.199
some of the tracks.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.434
Is that what you really want?

06:40.468 --> 06:42.369
With all the heat

06:42.402 --> 06:44.071
you got going on

06:44.104 --> 06:46.707
from being a part of
my Empire XStream launch,

06:46.740 --> 06:49.209
when the world is your oyster

06:49.242 --> 06:50.444
and you can put any name

06:50.478 --> 06:52.045
in your bucket list,

06:52.079 --> 06:54.381
and these are the only two
you want to work with?

06:54.414 --> 06:57.284
As far as you and
Hakeem working together,

06:57.317 --> 06:59.453
that's a whole nother
conversation.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.922
He's got an entirely new set

07:01.955 --> 07:04.257
of familial responsibilities
he's gotta handle.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.392
What's that got to do with it?

07:05.425 --> 07:06.727
LUCIOUS:
Bella's at home right now

07:06.760 --> 07:08.295
with her mother,
where you should be,

07:08.328 --> 07:11.899
but you've got
a convenient case of amnesia.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.634
But we're gonna talk
about that in private,

07:13.667 --> 07:14.968
'cause me and Shine...

07:15.002 --> 07:17.538
we got business to take care of.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.642
*

07:26.647 --> 07:29.517
You can keep
your fancy espresso machine,

07:29.550 --> 07:31.819
you can keep
your little fancy

07:31.852 --> 07:33.420
wine fridge...

07:33.453 --> 07:34.988
You know what?
Lucious, please,

07:35.022 --> 07:36.757
keep all of
this stuff, okay?

07:36.790 --> 07:40.027
In fact, give this to your wife.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.295
What are you trying
to do, impress me?

07:42.329 --> 07:44.632
You know I can buy
all of this stuff myself.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.866
All right, well,
why don't you just tell me

07:45.899 --> 07:47.100
what it is you need?

07:47.134 --> 07:48.936
What I need

07:48.969 --> 07:51.271
is for you to respect
my boundaries.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.806
Stop it with
all of this, Lucious,

07:52.840 --> 07:54.141
'cause it's not working.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.375
You handle
the business,

07:55.408 --> 07:56.644
I handle the music.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.878
That, and my three sons,

07:57.911 --> 07:59.379
that's all we need to discuss.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.949
Fine. From here on,
it's strictly business.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.216
Strictly business.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.452
Well, businesswise,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.655
you might want to come by
and see me later.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.523
Maybe you can take
a look at the artwork

08:09.557 --> 08:11.792
for Jamal's
Black and White album.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.661
Uh, Jamal doesn't want
to release

08:13.694 --> 08:15.295
the Black and White album.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.897
You know that,
Lucious.
Yeah, well,

08:16.930 --> 08:18.331
it's not about
what Jamal wants.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.801
Empire XStream
needs content.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.370
And Jamal needs for
his fans to forget about

08:23.403 --> 08:24.705
his little fainting,

08:24.738 --> 08:26.039
Justin Bieber moment.
Look,

08:26.073 --> 08:27.507
Tiana has a record

08:27.541 --> 08:28.909
that will be ready
by the end of the month.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.044
J Poppa's on his way
back from his tour,

08:31.078 --> 08:33.480
and V's single
is about to drop,

08:33.513 --> 08:34.815
so, there,
content.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.049
See, that's why
I love you.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.150
You're just amazing.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.418
Look,

08:38.451 --> 08:40.220
I mean that in
a strictly business way.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.488
Yeah. Right.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.890
I see you kept the gun.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.727
Bye, Fuh-Lucious.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.862
Nobody got time
for your mess.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.099
(sighs)

08:52.132 --> 08:53.801
They'll all come around.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.272
JAMAL:
Uh, over here,

08:59.306 --> 09:00.273
these are the recording studios.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.575
We'll go over there
in a little bit.

09:01.609 --> 09:04.544
This is where every single
Empire artist records.

09:04.578 --> 09:05.545
Um, that's the boardroom.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.047
They look like
they working;

09:07.080 --> 09:09.016
they not really
working.
(laughs)

09:09.049 --> 09:10.117
Oh, snap!
That's Lucious Lyon!

09:10.150 --> 09:11.518
Dad!

09:11.551 --> 09:13.553
Dad, wait, hold up.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.057
This is Councilman
Angelo Dubois.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.026
Mr. Lyon,
it's a pleasure.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.260
Oh, it's all mine.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.629
All right, all right.

09:21.662 --> 09:22.930
Mom and I met him
today at Power 105,

09:22.963 --> 09:24.431
so I'm kind of helping out

09:24.464 --> 09:25.866
with the anti-violence summit
with the kids.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.267
I'm Zeah,
Mr. Lyon.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.535
I'm gonna be an MC,
just like you.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.569
Want to hear something?

09:31.171 --> 09:33.273
Okay, go on ahead,
man, sure.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.975
All right, check.

09:35.008 --> 09:37.310
* First off, my main purpose
is to change the game *

09:37.344 --> 09:39.546
* Before I let you go,
bet you all know my name *

09:39.579 --> 09:42.249
* They call me Zey,
bet on me, catch a payday *

09:42.282 --> 09:44.885
* See, I'm a leader,
my flow cold, so grab a heater *

09:44.918 --> 09:47.287
* Before I let you go, OG,
it's great to meet you. *

09:47.320 --> 09:48.989
Ah!
(all cheering)

09:49.022 --> 09:50.557
(chuckling):
You had me nervous for a second.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.292
Man, I thought you was
coming straight for me.

09:52.325 --> 09:53.827
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.562
But we might have
to put you in the studio,

09:55.595 --> 09:57.898
seeing that Jamal
no longer makes music

09:57.931 --> 09:59.499
because he wants
to save the world.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.434
My dad likes
to come for me a lot,

10:01.468 --> 10:03.103
and it gets
very boring.
(chuckles)

10:03.136 --> 10:04.838
Besides, you're
missing the point.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.406
I'm now making music

10:06.439 --> 10:08.575
in order to save
the world.
All right.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.944
Zeah here's off
to MIT next year.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.646
3.8 GPA.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.314
Wow, that's impressive.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.416
You say your mama's
into this, right?

10:16.449 --> 10:18.085
I mean, I'm the one
that's on the panel.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.987
So why don't
we just hold the summit

10:20.020 --> 10:21.421
right here at Empire?

10:21.454 --> 10:22.589
(kids exclaiming)
Oh.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.824
Mr. Lyon, please...

10:23.857 --> 10:25.859
No, Lucious. Please.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.761
ANGELO:
I appreciate that,

10:27.795 --> 10:29.496
but we're good.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.164
We have a spot secured already;
the kids are excited...

10:31.198 --> 10:32.599
Well, why don't I
sweeten the deal

10:32.632 --> 10:35.535
and say Empire underwrites
the whole thing?

10:35.568 --> 10:37.671
Uh...

10:37.705 --> 10:38.939
Put me in an awkward...

10:38.972 --> 10:40.340
What do you think, kids?

10:40.373 --> 10:41.608
KIDS:
Yes!
Well, okay.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.843
There you have it.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.111
(chuckles)
It's a very,

10:44.144 --> 10:45.813
very generous offer,
Lucious.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.214
Thank you.
Extremely generous, Dad.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.449
What is this about?
Look, why don't we

10:49.482 --> 10:51.952
stream this whole thing live
on Empire XStream?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.553
(laughing)
I mean,
you've read about it

10:53.586 --> 10:55.622
and there's no better way
of getting your message out.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.490
Oh. Wow. You are
truly an angel, sir.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.959
Appreciate this.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.328
Keep doing what you're doing
with that.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.396
Oh, and by the way,
tell your mama about this

11:03.430 --> 11:05.833
so that she can facilitate
the music, all right?

11:07.935 --> 11:09.336
Nice meeting you,
Councilman.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.538
All right, sir.
Do well.

11:11.571 --> 11:12.740
*

11:14.842 --> 11:18.045
* It's the real, shawty,
I know you gotta feel me *

11:18.078 --> 11:20.047
* I asked them for a deal, said
if you could make us a Billie *

11:20.080 --> 11:22.983
* Been running this here,
I got a cramp in my Achilles *

11:23.016 --> 11:25.252
* Say you only get one shot,
I took nine *

11:25.285 --> 11:26.720
* Fif...

11:27.788 --> 11:31.358
No... that was it, Keem.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.260
Yeah?
Yes,

11:33.293 --> 11:34.527
that was hot.

11:34.561 --> 11:35.896
Oh, so...

11:35.929 --> 11:37.530
first you hate me,
then you love me.

11:37.564 --> 11:40.367
Is that it?

11:40.400 --> 11:43.603
* First you hate me,
then you love me *

11:43.636 --> 11:45.105
* First you hate me

11:45.138 --> 11:47.374
* First you hate me,
then you love me *

11:47.407 --> 11:49.409
* First you hate me,
then you love me *

11:49.442 --> 11:50.778
(snaps fingers)
Ooh, I got it.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.045
* First they hate you

11:52.079 --> 11:53.213
* Then they love you

11:53.246 --> 11:54.748
* Fo' sho',
no doubt *

11:54.782 --> 11:56.249
* They love you when they
see you got potential *

11:56.283 --> 11:57.584
* When you roll out

11:57.617 --> 11:59.052
* Hustle till it's all out

11:59.086 --> 12:00.120
* Bundle when it's cold out

12:00.153 --> 12:01.521
* And watch your every move

12:01.554 --> 12:03.190
* Yeah, they plotting
when you ball out *

12:03.223 --> 12:04.892
* They see you getting money
and you eatin' *

12:04.925 --> 12:06.226
* They want a plate

12:06.259 --> 12:07.594
* Dog eat dog out here

12:07.627 --> 12:08.862
* Bring ya kind of bait

12:08.896 --> 12:10.230
* Gettin' cheese all over

12:10.263 --> 12:11.765
* I'm kinda great

12:11.799 --> 12:14.201
* Just got me a Nu-Nu chick,
uh, time to skate *

12:14.234 --> 12:16.904
* I asked, if I was to go,
would she remember me? *

12:16.937 --> 12:18.438
* Got a lot of class,
but we lack *

12:18.471 --> 12:19.940
* A lot of chemistry

12:19.973 --> 12:22.209
* On to the previous,
bye, see ya *

12:22.242 --> 12:25.145
* All said and done,
it was a pleasure to meet ya *

12:25.178 --> 12:27.815
Man, we need something
to make this song legendary.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.482
Like, once they hear it,
they ain't gonna forget it.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.718
I mean, it has to be
something they know.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.987
You'll remember you,
remember me?
You'll remember...

12:34.021 --> 12:35.755
BOTH:
You'll remember my name!

12:35.789 --> 12:37.057
* Don't count me out

12:37.090 --> 12:38.591
* I'm here to stay

12:38.625 --> 12:40.560
* Before you know
I've changed the game *

12:40.593 --> 12:41.962
* You'll see

12:41.995 --> 12:44.798
* You will remember my name

12:44.832 --> 12:46.666
* Name, name *
* Name

12:46.699 --> 12:49.169
* Guess I'm on my A.I.,
put on for the city *

12:49.202 --> 12:51.738
* And I gave 'em all I can,
once you fall off *

12:51.771 --> 12:53.106
There you go, mama.
* They say bye,
you know I'm-a baller *

12:53.140 --> 12:55.408
* Overseeing all the downers
Uh!

12:55.442 --> 12:58.145
* Looking through the game,
all I see is real around us *

12:58.178 --> 13:00.413
* Yeah, yeah, how to deal
with all this tension *

13:00.447 --> 13:02.282
* When they quick
to switch up on ya *

13:02.315 --> 13:04.651
Ah!
* When it's all said and done

13:04.684 --> 13:06.153
* I will be

13:06.186 --> 13:07.821
* Number one

13:07.855 --> 13:09.089
* You'll see

13:09.122 --> 13:11.791
* You will remember my name

13:11.825 --> 13:13.626
* Name, name, name *

13:13.660 --> 13:16.129
* Oh
* Oh, oh, oh, oh. *

13:21.969 --> 13:23.470
What else?
Uh, Jamal is back in
the studio this week.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.505
Don't worry about Jamal.
I got him.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.674
What about your boy J Poppa?
He's ready to get back

13:27.707 --> 13:29.142
in the booth, so I lined up

13:29.176 --> 13:30.844
a bunch of brand-new
producers for him...

13:30.878 --> 13:33.380
Right, but isn't
his contract up with Empire?

13:33.413 --> 13:35.215
Is he gonna re-up?
Obviously.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.350
He ain't going nowhere.
He's very happy here.

13:37.384 --> 13:40.353
But, uh, you know, y-you said

13:40.387 --> 13:42.322
that you wanted
to talk to me about

13:42.355 --> 13:44.858
the A&R position, and I
actually have a lot of ideas,

13:44.892 --> 13:46.726
and if I could...
Wow, Becky,

13:46.759 --> 13:48.395
you look beautiful.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.863
Thank you.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.899
Hey, um, I got a gift.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.334
Don't worry, it's not for you.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.802
It's for Jamal.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.204
Uh...
Five minutes,

13:57.237 --> 13:58.671
that's it.
Please.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.041
Okay. I'll be back.
Mm-hmm.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.410
I was thinking about, um...

14:03.443 --> 14:06.046
our son's little problem.
And so I thought

14:06.079 --> 14:09.049
maybe if I got him a new track--
sometimes a new track

14:09.082 --> 14:11.919
can make you feel different
about where you are.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.521
But I knew he wouldn't
take it from me.
(music starts playing)

14:14.554 --> 14:17.357
But I thought you might say
it was from you.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.460
*

14:26.533 --> 14:27.800
(beat kicks in)

14:45.585 --> 14:47.554
(music stops)
Jamal doesn't have a problem.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.522
And I know what
you're doing, Lucious.
What am I doing?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.091
That's when we first met.
(boys vocalizing, beatboxing)

14:51.124 --> 14:52.759
BOY: * I started throwing bass,
she started... *

14:52.792 --> 14:55.428
* She said, "No, I don't
He is kind of cute.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.197
No, he's not cute.
* I only have a friend"

14:57.230 --> 14:59.766
* Come on,
I'm not even goin' for it *

14:59.799 --> 15:01.201
Don't-don't do it.
Wh-Where you going?

15:01.234 --> 15:03.103
* You

15:03.136 --> 15:06.406
* You got what I need
(vocalizing, beatboxing)

15:06.439 --> 15:09.742
* And you say
he's just a friend *

15:09.776 --> 15:11.211
* And you say he's just

15:11.244 --> 15:12.879
* A friend,
oh, baby *

15:12.912 --> 15:14.247
* You

15:14.281 --> 15:17.985
* You got what I need

15:18.018 --> 15:20.720
* And you say
he's just a friend *

15:20.753 --> 15:22.555
* And you say
he's just a friend *

15:22.589 --> 15:24.824
Boy...
* Oh, baby, you

15:24.857 --> 15:28.395
* Got what I need
Yeah.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.231
* And you say
he's just a friend *

15:31.264 --> 15:33.900
* And you say
he's just a friend *

15:33.933 --> 15:36.769
* Oh, baby, you
(chuckles)

15:36.803 --> 15:39.672
* You got what I need

15:39.706 --> 15:41.975
* And you say
he's just a friend *

15:42.009 --> 15:43.943
* And you say he's just
a friend *

15:43.977 --> 15:45.178
* Oh, baby

15:45.212 --> 15:46.746
* You...

15:46.779 --> 15:49.182
When I first saw you rap...

15:49.216 --> 15:51.318
changed my life.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.320
I knew right then and
there that I was...

15:53.353 --> 15:55.788
That you and I
were meant to be together.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.024
See, that...
That I...

15:57.057 --> 15:58.425
was meant
to do music.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.128
No, we-- you and I--

16:01.161 --> 16:03.163
were meant to be
making music together.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.532
Lucious, I need you
to understand

16:05.565 --> 16:06.866
that I am done.

16:06.899 --> 16:09.036
Okay?
Oh, Cook, this is nothing.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.471
I mean, look at everything
we done been through.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.373
(chuckling):
I mean, think about it.

16:13.406 --> 16:16.176
You remember the first time
I tried to out-dance you?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.812
No one could out-dance me
back then.

16:19.846 --> 16:20.880
(laughs)

16:20.913 --> 16:22.282
I will give Jamal the track

16:22.315 --> 16:24.017
and see if he's inspired.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.185
Thank you.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.486
(music starts playing)

16:27.987 --> 16:29.556
You're not gonna
wear me down, man.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.192
It's not gonna happen.
Done.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.696
*

16:38.231 --> 16:40.333
Where are you?

16:40.367 --> 16:42.502
Talk to me.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.237
I need your help.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.506
RHONDA:
Sorry.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.378
Can't help you
with those anymore.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.882
Where are you?

16:55.915 --> 16:57.917
Please.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.919
I-I need to see you.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.255
Where are you?!

17:02.289 --> 17:04.291
Where are you?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.229
Who you talking to?

17:12.299 --> 17:13.566
Rhonda.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.471
She's here?

17:21.274 --> 17:22.642
No.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.546
Oh, I just...

17:26.579 --> 17:28.648
(crying):
I'm not gonna make it, Jamal.

17:32.119 --> 17:35.255
Oh, she-she managed all
of this. It's like this...

17:35.288 --> 17:37.524
It-it changes, it
changes all the time.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.426
It changes all the time.
And she-she's...

17:39.459 --> 17:41.928
she kept track of it, you know?
She's-she took care of it

17:41.961 --> 17:43.796
for me, she's the one
that did it all.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.865
All right, well,
I'll help you with that.
No, she... I...

17:45.898 --> 17:47.134
It's all right,
no, no, no.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.036
I got...
Hey, listen, Dre...

17:50.069 --> 17:51.738
I can help you with this.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.441
I-I can't ask you
to do that, Jamal.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.643
I'm not gonna...
No, you can, actually.
It's cool.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.447
Shoot, I'm trying to wean myself

18:00.480 --> 18:02.349
off these stupid
pain meds anyway.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.319
I keep this chart.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.821
It just helps me
keep track of it, you know?

18:14.161 --> 18:17.096
I'm gonna keep your chart,
too, all right?

18:23.170 --> 18:25.738
Okay.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.774
(crying)

18:36.883 --> 18:39.118
*

18:45.825 --> 18:47.126
Lucious!

18:53.065 --> 18:55.034
What's up, Cook?

18:55.067 --> 18:56.269
What are you doing?

18:56.303 --> 18:58.305
What do you mean?

18:58.338 --> 18:59.706
You know who that is?

18:59.739 --> 19:01.941
Yeah, that's
Angelo Dubois, some

19:01.974 --> 19:03.343
petty government bureaucrat

19:03.376 --> 19:05.678
from some bougie-ass
Jack and Jill family.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.380
What about it?
What is wrong with you, Lucious?

19:07.414 --> 19:09.282
Last week you had
a FBI agent at the house,

19:09.316 --> 19:11.117
now you opening doors
for government officials?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.052
Really?
What are you talking about?

19:13.085 --> 19:15.822
I mean, Thirsty ran a check
on this dude. He had a DUI

19:15.855 --> 19:18.225
some 20 years ago.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.626
His family pulled some
strings and got him

19:19.659 --> 19:21.127
out of that.
Other than that,

19:21.160 --> 19:23.730
he's as about as square
as a damn checkerboard.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.198
Now, I was under the impression

19:25.232 --> 19:27.200
that you wanted
to do this summit thing.

19:27.234 --> 19:30.102
Mm. Is that what Jamal told you?

19:31.604 --> 19:33.506
Well, we both know
why he's doing it,

19:33.540 --> 19:35.708
so let's just end the damn cycle
and get it over with.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.009
Hey...

19:37.043 --> 19:39.145
Off of me.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.548
Jamal's got a problem.
You know that, right?

19:41.581 --> 19:44.150
What are you talking about, man?
This whole
"I want to end the cycle"

19:44.183 --> 19:46.152
is some BS
to cover the fact that

19:46.185 --> 19:48.555
that boy can't sing no more.
JAMAL: Mom.

19:48.588 --> 19:51.591
You remember Angelo?

19:51.624 --> 19:53.426
Mr. Dubois, I really

19:53.460 --> 19:55.662
don't appreciate you
exploiting my son's situation

19:55.695 --> 19:57.730
for your political tricknology.
Oh, Lord.

19:57.764 --> 20:01.434
So we gonna do your little
summit, and then you're

20:01.468 --> 20:03.703
gonna stay the hell out
of our business, is that clear?

20:03.736 --> 20:05.605
I'm hoping you'll feel a
little, little differently

20:05.638 --> 20:06.906
once-once you get to know me.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.175
Oh, I know... I know you plenty.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.443
I know plenty of you.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.044
Yeah, with
your with your

20:12.078 --> 20:13.580
high seditty-
talking ass

20:13.613 --> 20:16.449
with your little summits
and town hall meetings

20:16.483 --> 20:18.418
when you ain't doing nothing
but preaching to the choir.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.686
What are you really
teaching those kids?

20:19.719 --> 20:20.920
Oh, oh, those "victims,"

20:20.953 --> 20:22.422
like you keep calling 'em?

20:22.455 --> 20:24.591
I think I'm being misunderst...
Mr. Dubois,

20:24.624 --> 20:26.192
what you don't understand

20:26.225 --> 20:28.361
is those kids carry a
pain that people like you

20:28.395 --> 20:29.729
can't even begin to imagine.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.464
See, you ain't never

20:31.498 --> 20:33.700
had to overcome
nothing, have you?

20:33.733 --> 20:36.703
Now, what do you think
happens to one of those kids

20:36.736 --> 20:38.638
if they get into some nonsense?

20:38.671 --> 20:40.473
You know, kids
get into nonsense,

20:40.507 --> 20:42.208
but unlike you, they don't
have family connections

20:42.241 --> 20:44.477
to get them off a DUI scot-free.

20:44.511 --> 20:49.148
So who is going to give them
a second chance, huh? You?

20:49.181 --> 20:50.283
(chuckles)

20:50.317 --> 20:51.584
With your clean-shaven,

20:51.618 --> 20:53.553
slick-talking ass,

20:53.586 --> 20:57.324
acting all holier-than-thou,
could've killed somebody

20:57.357 --> 20:59.392
but didn't,
got a slap on the wrist

20:59.426 --> 21:00.760
for drunk driving ass?

21:00.793 --> 21:01.994
Get out of here.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.996
You a joke!

21:04.030 --> 21:05.732
Well, damn. Only other person

21:05.765 --> 21:08.267
I ever seen her go off
on like that is you.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.671
Angelo...

21:11.704 --> 21:12.972
I'm sorry, man.
That's all right.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.273
She's something else.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.914
(muffled): * I said,
"How do you like the show?" *

21:21.948 --> 21:23.983
* She said,
"I was very amused" *
Is that a radio?

21:24.016 --> 21:26.953
Porsha!
* She acted kind of strange

21:26.986 --> 21:29.255
* Then when I asked,
"Do ya have a man?" *

21:29.288 --> 21:31.658
* She tried to pretend,
she said, "No, I don't *
What is that?

21:31.691 --> 21:35.094
* I only have a friend"
Boys left the damn radio on.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.665
* Come on!

21:38.698 --> 21:40.299
* You!
Aah!

21:40.333 --> 21:42.335
Biz!
* You got what I need

21:42.369 --> 21:43.970
Who did this?

21:44.003 --> 21:46.305
* But you say
he's just a friend *

21:46.339 --> 21:49.108
Oh...
* And you say
he's just a friend *

21:49.141 --> 21:51.944
BOTH:
* Oh, baby, you

21:51.978 --> 21:54.647
* You got what I need

21:54.681 --> 21:58.117
* But you say
he's just a friend *

21:58.150 --> 22:00.553
* And you say he's just
a friend *

22:00.587 --> 22:03.656
* So I took blah-blah's
word for it at this time *

22:03.690 --> 22:06.493
* I thought just havin' a friend
couldn't be no crime *

22:06.526 --> 22:08.461
* 'Cause I have friends

22:08.495 --> 22:10.029
* And that's a fact, like

22:10.062 --> 22:12.832
* Agnes, Agatha,
Germaine and Jack *

22:12.865 --> 22:15.668
* Forget about that,
let's go into the story *

22:15.702 --> 22:18.070
* About a girl named
blah-blah-blah that adored me *

22:18.104 --> 22:20.907
* So we started talkin',
gettin' familiar *

22:20.940 --> 22:23.743
* Spendin' a lot of time
so we can build up *

22:23.776 --> 22:25.545
* A relationship

22:25.578 --> 22:28.080
* I called every day
to see how she was doin' *

22:28.114 --> 22:29.916
* Every time that I
called her it seemed *

22:29.949 --> 22:31.384
* Somethin' was brewin',
I called her room *

22:31.418 --> 22:33.185
* A guy picked up,
and then I called again *

22:33.219 --> 22:37.757
BOTH:
* I said, "Yo, who was that?"
"Oh, he's just a friend" *

22:37.790 --> 22:40.593
* Man, don't gimme that.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.395
(laughs)

22:42.429 --> 22:43.396
(music stops)
Yay!

22:43.430 --> 22:45.164
Thank you so much.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.399
That was great.
My pleasure.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.401
Anything for my man Lucious.

22:48.435 --> 22:51.237
You're righteous,
boss. I owe you.
Not even my birthday.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.705
Thanks, fellas.
Thanks, y'all.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.241
All right.
(laughs) Thank y'all, brothers.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.747
Now, you got to admit
that-that had to have

23:00.780 --> 23:02.281
gotten you a little bit, right?

23:02.314 --> 23:04.451
The music got me.
Yeah, the music.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.553
Now, I know we have a
lot of history together,

23:06.586 --> 23:09.556
but you can't keep
hitting me over the head

23:09.589 --> 23:11.558
with this "when we
first saw each other"

23:11.591 --> 23:13.560
sentimental crap.
Nah.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.862
Come here, come here.

23:15.895 --> 23:19.131
I got a little confession
I need to make to you.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.135
Now, that might've been

23:23.169 --> 23:25.972
the first time that
you saw me, but...

23:26.005 --> 23:28.808
that wasn't the first time
I saw you.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.042
* Sucker duck,
now that's clue number three *

23:30.076 --> 23:32.945
* You wrong 'cause it was EPMD

23:32.979 --> 23:35.782
* MCs, get off the bandwagon

23:35.815 --> 23:38.651
* I'm not bragging
but tagging... *

23:38.685 --> 23:40.086
So can I see you later?

23:40.119 --> 23:41.721
I got homework, Barry.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.389
But me and my sisters are
gonna get some water ice

23:43.422 --> 23:45.792
right after, so... maybe then.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.326
A'ight?
A'ight, bet.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.661
* That if he pulls my card

23:48.695 --> 23:50.897
* I'm good to flow, toe to toe

23:50.930 --> 23:51.998
* Blow to blow, without no H2O

23:52.031 --> 23:53.399
* Hey, yo...

23:53.432 --> 23:56.135
That jawn got a nice ass,
don't she?

23:56.168 --> 23:57.737
Do you know her?

23:57.770 --> 23:58.971
Nah.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.973
Good.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.943
'Cause I'm about
to make her mine.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.545
So watch your mouth.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.848
* This ain't a blast
from the past... *

24:08.881 --> 24:10.382
(chuckles)

24:12.785 --> 24:15.354
I swear, I must have sat out

24:15.387 --> 24:18.157
in front of that water ice shop

24:18.190 --> 24:20.292
for, like, two and a half hours

24:20.326 --> 24:22.328
just hoping
and waiting for...

24:22.361 --> 24:24.597
to get my little
rap right, so by the time

24:24.631 --> 24:27.133
you decided to come out, I would
be able to spit something

24:27.166 --> 24:29.435
that you might like.
So you knew I
had a boyfriend

24:29.468 --> 24:31.771
and you still
tried to get at me?
No.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.439
I knew that it was a long shot.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.441
I knew that you was this

24:35.474 --> 24:37.443
Catholic, studious girl...

24:37.476 --> 24:39.879
hanging out with some nerd.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.814
And why would a girl like you

24:41.848 --> 24:43.716
want to talk
to somebody like me?
Barry

24:43.750 --> 24:46.619
was not a nerd.
No, but he wasn't a gangster.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.320
That was me, all day long.

24:48.354 --> 24:51.123
And that's what I was,
and you knew that.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.792
You knew that was
what I was about,

24:52.825 --> 24:54.727
but instead of running,
you stuck around.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.462
Yeah, well, I was
young and simple.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.565
I should've
stayed with Barry.

24:58.598 --> 25:00.833
I'm serious, Cookie.

25:00.867 --> 25:04.403
You saw me in those streets
and you knew...

25:04.436 --> 25:07.807
that that wasn't my destiny.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.209
You knew that my destiny
was music

25:10.242 --> 25:13.079
and my destiny was you.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.388
How'd you do it?

25:24.223 --> 25:25.725
How'd I do what?

25:27.293 --> 25:29.996
I don't know anybody
who lost more than you.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.998
And you survived it,

25:32.031 --> 25:34.767
and you're-you're still here,
you're still fighting.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.238
You're a fighter, too, Andre.

25:39.271 --> 25:42.541
I mean, after I met
your grandmother,

25:42.575 --> 25:45.778
everything makes sense now.
And I admire you even more.

25:45.812 --> 25:48.347
I mean, Andre, look at
what all you've accomplished.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.382
Yeah, look where
that got me, Mama.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.787
You sure you don't want
to go back to church, baby?

25:54.821 --> 25:57.356
Oh.
Huh? Yeah. And, um...

25:57.389 --> 25:59.091
clear your mind, heal your soul.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.526
So much is...
What soul?

26:00.559 --> 26:01.861
Don't say that, And...

26:01.894 --> 26:04.764
What soul?

26:04.797 --> 26:06.398
Look, come here.
Sit down.

26:08.500 --> 26:09.969
I'm proud of you.

26:10.002 --> 26:11.971
No, no, no, no, no--

26:12.004 --> 26:13.806
I'm proud of you, Andre.

26:13.840 --> 26:17.476
Didn't nobody have no summits
for you when I got locked away.

26:17.509 --> 26:19.578
You figured it out
all on your own.

26:19.612 --> 26:21.480
You fought your way
out of the hood, baby,

26:21.513 --> 26:25.151
you got yourself into
Wharton. You did that.

26:25.184 --> 26:27.253
Against all obstacles.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.956
Against everything this world
throws at black people,

26:29.989 --> 26:33.926
you fought your way out.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.395
Keep fighting.

26:36.428 --> 26:40.099
Please, okay?

26:40.132 --> 26:41.801
'Cause I got you.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.736
I got you, no matter what.

26:43.770 --> 26:44.837
No matter what?

26:44.871 --> 26:47.106
No matter what, baby.

26:48.675 --> 26:51.410
(shuddering breath)

26:51.443 --> 26:52.679
You gonna be all right, baby.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.714
Okay.
Yes.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.785
Okay.
Okay.

26:58.818 --> 27:01.120
*

27:03.823 --> 27:06.358
See, on the trill I was thinking
I come back right here,

27:06.392 --> 27:08.427
drop some ad-libs
for a bar, man.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.529
Okay, yeah.
I say do it for two bars--

27:10.562 --> 27:12.464
it's gonna build the
anticipation for the hook,

27:12.498 --> 27:14.100
and that's gonna make it hard.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.367
Yeah, I agree.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.036
It needs to come harder.
Yeah.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.771
(music stops)
Or maybe we drop everything

27:18.805 --> 27:20.506
and keep
the bass line.

27:20.539 --> 27:22.541
Yeah?
SHINE: Yeah.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.610
Yeah, I think
you're on to something.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.012
All right, then.

27:26.045 --> 27:28.014
Hey, stand up for me, homie.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.648
Where'd you put
that bass channel I...

27:29.682 --> 27:31.150
(grunts)

27:33.419 --> 27:34.821
You must be out your
rabbit-ass mind,

27:34.854 --> 27:36.856
lookin' at my sister
like that.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.828
Think I'm playing?

27:41.861 --> 27:43.562
He'll be all right.

27:43.595 --> 27:45.297
Okay...

27:45.331 --> 27:47.700
what was you saying, Hakeem?

27:55.341 --> 27:56.709
* They don't wanna see us
make it *
* But we still gonna make it *

27:56.743 --> 27:57.910
* That's why
they always hatin' *

27:57.944 --> 27:59.178
* Why they always hating *

27:59.211 --> 28:01.313
* They don't really want
to see us win *

28:01.347 --> 28:04.350
* They rather see us dead
or in the pen *
* Watch out, watch out *

28:04.383 --> 28:07.386
* They don't wanna
see us make it *
* But we still gonna make it *

28:07.419 --> 28:10.389
* That's why we gonna make it
* Why they always hatin' *

28:10.422 --> 28:11.690
* Don't you know that
you was born to win? *

28:11.724 --> 28:13.159
* All you gotta do is stay up

28:13.192 --> 28:15.494
* Out the pen, stay awake
and watch out *

28:15.527 --> 28:17.930
* I'm tired of seeing
people dying *

28:17.964 --> 28:21.100
* On the news
all I see is crying *
* I swear I can't take it *

28:21.133 --> 28:23.035
* I need to see
my people trying *

28:23.069 --> 28:25.537
* In the jungle
just roll with the lions *

28:25.571 --> 28:28.674
* Just roll with a lion *
* 'Cause it's a jungle
out there, boy, it's a jungle *

28:28.707 --> 28:30.877
* It's a jungle *
* And they don't want you to
grow, they want to stunt you *

28:30.910 --> 28:33.780
* They wanna leave you back *
* We need to start
raising the bar *

28:33.813 --> 28:37.716
* Dream big
and just reach for the stars *
* All you gotta do is reach *

28:37.750 --> 28:40.186
* They don't wanna see us make
it *
* But we still gonna make it *

28:40.219 --> 28:42.688
* That's why we gonna make it
* Why they always hatin'? *

28:42.721 --> 28:44.757
* Don't you know that you was
born to win? *

28:44.791 --> 28:46.625
* All you gotta do
is stay up out the pen *

28:46.658 --> 28:48.560
* Stay awake and watch out.

28:48.594 --> 28:50.096
(cheering and applause)

28:50.129 --> 28:51.263
ANGELO:
Yes.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.199
Yes, yes.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.168
Thank you, young Zeah.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.139
And now let me introduce to you

29:00.172 --> 29:02.308
our guest of honor.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.243
Jamal Lyon.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.745
(cheering and applause)

29:09.816 --> 29:11.483
He himself a victim...

29:14.020 --> 29:15.721
(clears throat)

29:15.754 --> 29:17.890
Excuse me.

29:17.924 --> 29:20.726
I'm going to replace
the word "victim"

29:20.759 --> 29:22.661
with "survivor."
Yes.

29:22.694 --> 29:24.797
(applause)
Yes, survivor.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.132
Jamal Lyon,

29:26.165 --> 29:28.801
he himself a survivor
of gun violence.

29:28.835 --> 29:30.136
You see, these young men...

29:30.169 --> 29:32.238
Look, I know he
get on your nerves,

29:32.271 --> 29:33.840
but he is fine.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.507
ANGELO: ...they all come from
a place where violence

29:35.541 --> 29:37.309
is a natural go-to.

29:37.343 --> 29:40.412
But our goal is not
to save the world.

29:40.446 --> 29:44.750
Our goal is to pull them
upwards from violence

29:44.783 --> 29:47.319
and move them onward
to success.

29:47.353 --> 29:49.155
(applause)

29:49.188 --> 29:51.757
That was good,
though, wasn't it?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.692
Look, you look full, don't you?
(laughs)

29:57.163 --> 29:59.031
Hey, man, here you go.

29:59.065 --> 30:00.432
Thank you, thank you, man!

30:00.466 --> 30:02.835
Uh-uh, I'm keeping mine.

30:02.869 --> 30:05.437
Candace would kill me if I
didn't save her some crab legs.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.874
Most of 'em
are crackheads anyway.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.541
Well, maybe they
wouldn't be if someone

30:09.575 --> 30:11.777
had shared their crab
legs a little sooner.

30:11.810 --> 30:15.147
What are you,
Mr. Save-the-World now?

30:15.181 --> 30:16.448
With you by my side.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.650
By the time you
finish up at Howard,

30:18.684 --> 30:20.286
I'll be getting
out of med school

30:20.319 --> 30:21.787
and I can set up a practice

30:21.820 --> 30:25.357
in King of Prussia.

30:25.391 --> 30:26.993
All right,
forget King of Prussia...

30:27.026 --> 30:30.729
Look, Barry, stop.

30:30.762 --> 30:33.632
I'm-a be honest, a'ight?

30:33.665 --> 30:37.169
At some point, I want
the house and the kids

30:37.203 --> 30:38.905
and all that stuff that
you say, but right now?

30:38.938 --> 30:40.739
I don't know what I want

30:40.772 --> 30:43.910
except I know it's got
something to do with music.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.677
And I don't want to
feel locked down

30:45.711 --> 30:47.179
before I even give it a shot.

30:47.213 --> 30:51.017
Ya'mean?

30:51.050 --> 30:53.252
I understand, Loretha.

30:53.285 --> 30:55.054
It's your life.

30:55.087 --> 30:58.124
You won't get a second chance
to live it the way you want.

31:01.227 --> 31:02.561
ANGELO:
Now, yesterday

31:02.594 --> 31:05.597
I got chin-checked
by a remarkable woman

31:05.631 --> 31:07.833
who taught me the difference

31:07.866 --> 31:10.569
between being
a victim of circumstance

31:10.602 --> 31:13.339
and a survivor of
immeasurable pain.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.207
I have a feeling

31:15.241 --> 31:17.276
I'll be thanking
her over and over

31:17.309 --> 31:20.846
and over for that insight.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.949
Now I'd like to
bring up here onstage

31:22.982 --> 31:25.451
a man who is
a new friend of WOKE.

31:25.484 --> 31:28.620
The incredible Lucious Lyon.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.389
(cheering and applause)

31:38.830 --> 31:41.233
Thank you, Angelo.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.804
I'm very proud of these
young men and women here.

31:45.837 --> 31:48.440
You guys represent our future.

31:48.474 --> 31:52.211
And we are looking to you
to be great leaders.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.912
I have my son here.

31:53.946 --> 31:55.414
And as you all know,

31:55.447 --> 31:58.084
he almost lost his life

31:58.117 --> 31:59.751
trying to save my own.

31:59.785 --> 32:01.320
(applause)

32:07.026 --> 32:10.462
Now I know we all want to get to
the talking part of this summit,

32:10.496 --> 32:12.098
but before we do that,

32:12.131 --> 32:14.233
why don't we take a moment

32:14.266 --> 32:16.435
and have Jamal Lyon

32:16.468 --> 32:18.504
come up here and do a song,

32:18.537 --> 32:21.140
'cause he has not performed
since that event at the ASAs.

32:21.173 --> 32:22.408
And I think this would be

32:22.441 --> 32:24.910
a most fitting moment for him.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.312
(cheering and applause)

32:31.550 --> 32:32.751
Jamal. Jamal.

32:32.784 --> 32:33.986
Jamal.

32:34.020 --> 32:36.788
Jamal. Jamal. Jamal.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.024
ALL (chanting):
Jamal! Jamal!

32:38.057 --> 32:40.792
Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal!

32:40.826 --> 32:44.830
Jamal! Jamal! Jamal!
Jamal! Jamal! Jamal!

32:44.863 --> 32:47.266
Jamal! Jamal! Jamal!

32:47.299 --> 32:50.436
Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal!

32:50.469 --> 32:53.672
Jamal! Jamal!
Jamal! Jamal!

32:53.705 --> 32:56.175
Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal!

32:56.208 --> 32:58.677
(heavy breathing)

32:58.710 --> 33:00.612
(exhales heavily)

33:00.646 --> 33:02.648
(breathing heavily)

33:06.085 --> 33:07.353
(exhales shakily)

33:12.691 --> 33:13.925
(breathing heavily)

33:16.728 --> 33:18.697
Jamal.

33:18.730 --> 33:19.965
What are you doing?

33:19.998 --> 33:21.167
Huh?

33:21.200 --> 33:22.468
What's going on?

33:22.501 --> 33:24.570
(gasping)

33:24.603 --> 33:25.471
What the hell
is wrong with you?

33:25.504 --> 33:27.239
What he need to do

33:27.273 --> 33:28.907
is get his ass on that stage.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.042
'Cause the only way

33:30.076 --> 33:32.044
to deal with a problem, boy,

33:32.078 --> 33:33.679
is to deal with a problem.

33:33.712 --> 33:34.913
It keeps happening.
Shh, all right.

33:34.946 --> 33:36.382
It keeps happening.

33:36.415 --> 33:37.716
You really starting
to bore me, boy.

33:37.749 --> 33:38.984
I'm scared, all right?!

33:39.017 --> 33:40.186
That's what you want, right?

33:40.219 --> 33:41.353
(gasping)

33:44.022 --> 33:45.924
Well, yeah, I got a,
I got a pro-- I got a problem

33:45.957 --> 33:47.359
and I...

33:47.393 --> 33:49.228
can't get onstage.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.265
I can't...
I can't do it no more.

34:07.079 --> 34:09.081
*

34:09.115 --> 34:10.349
Yeah!

34:10.382 --> 34:12.518
(indistinct chatter)

34:12.551 --> 34:14.086
You were right.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.921
Jamal has a problem.

34:15.954 --> 34:18.023
So, what we gonna
do to fix it?

34:18.056 --> 34:20.025
I don't think

34:20.058 --> 34:21.627
this is something you need
to be smiling about.

34:21.660 --> 34:24.096
Well, you said the magic word.

34:24.130 --> 34:26.932
It's "we."

34:26.965 --> 34:28.900
I mean, that's how
it's always been,

34:28.934 --> 34:30.302
Lucious and Cookie,
you know?

34:30.336 --> 34:31.303
You and me against

34:31.337 --> 34:33.305
this crazy-ass world and...

34:33.339 --> 34:35.141
us versus everybody else.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.542
Excuse my interruption.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.210
I'm sorry.

34:38.244 --> 34:40.312
I just wanted to thank you both
for today.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.881
We couldn't have done it
without both of your support.

34:42.914 --> 34:45.217
You know, a lot of these kids,
they come from broken homes.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.786
You know, uh, divorce,
separation...

34:47.819 --> 34:49.721
Some parents never even...
(chuckles)

34:49.755 --> 34:51.123
...were together
in the first place.

34:51.157 --> 34:53.292
So it just
means a lot

34:53.325 --> 34:54.893
to have these kids
see you two

34:54.926 --> 34:57.129
together, getting along
even though

34:57.163 --> 34:59.097
you're not married
anymore.

34:59.131 --> 35:00.332
It's truly amazing.

35:00.366 --> 35:01.933
Black love. It's beautiful.

35:01.967 --> 35:03.469
"Black love..."

35:03.502 --> 35:04.970
Tell me something,
Councilman.

35:05.003 --> 35:06.172
Sir.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.574
Are you from a "broken family"?
No.

35:08.607 --> 35:09.808
No, not at all.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.510
My parents been together
50 years.

35:11.543 --> 35:12.944
50 years.
Wow, that...
Yeah.

35:12.978 --> 35:14.480
...that is something.
It's a blessing.

35:14.513 --> 35:15.514
Lucious and I ain't together.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.649
ANGELO: Oh.
Mm-mm, no.

35:17.683 --> 35:22.321
But we've been
ride or die for...

35:22.354 --> 35:25.924
Well, if I tell you that,
I'd be telling you my age.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.193
(both chuckle)
Ms. Lyon...

35:27.226 --> 35:29.094
Oh, no, Cookie.
(giggles)

35:29.127 --> 35:30.262
Well, Cookie...

35:30.296 --> 35:32.030
uh, you should come down
to the center sometime

35:32.063 --> 35:33.499
and speak to
the young women.

35:33.532 --> 35:34.800
I think they'd, uh,

35:34.833 --> 35:35.867
they'd get a kick
out of that.

35:35.901 --> 35:37.303
Well, you should
invite me over.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.770
I will.
I will, then, Cookie.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.539
Yes.
Lucious...

35:40.572 --> 35:43.309
Thanks again, man.

35:46.245 --> 35:49.181
I think you had it right
the first time.

35:49.215 --> 35:51.049
It's Mr. Lyon.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.662
*

36:05.397 --> 36:06.632
Mmm...
(gasps)

36:06.665 --> 36:07.899
(laughs)

36:07.933 --> 36:09.401
You scare me!

36:09.435 --> 36:10.769
I got good news.

36:13.739 --> 36:14.973
Good news?

36:15.006 --> 36:16.208
I love good news.
Tell me.

36:16.242 --> 36:18.043
I'm leaving Empire.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.046
How is that good news?

36:21.079 --> 36:22.814
'Cause I got
a offer from Vaughn.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.350
(scoffs)

36:24.383 --> 36:26.252
Hell, Lucious just
had him at the house.

36:26.285 --> 36:27.753
He's a snake.
What's the offer?

36:27.786 --> 36:30.922
Yo, it's a hell
of an offer, Beck.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.324
And the best
part about it...

36:32.358 --> 36:34.726
I negotiated for you
to come with me.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.862
Who asked you to do that?

36:36.895 --> 36:38.730
Lucious and Cookie
make you head of A&R yet?

36:38.764 --> 36:40.599
We are talking about it.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.403
The word on the street...

36:44.436 --> 36:46.272
is that they're looking
for somebody new.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.342
It's time for you
to bail, mama.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.578
You need to be somewhere
where you appreciated.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.783
And we make a dope-ass team,
Becky with the Good Hair.

36:57.816 --> 37:00.051
That's real talk.

37:00.085 --> 37:01.687
You know, Lucious gave me a job

37:01.720 --> 37:03.422
when no one else
would even talk to me.

37:03.455 --> 37:05.257
That's real talk.
I'm not doing this thing.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.259
Come on, this place
is going down in flames,

37:07.293 --> 37:09.194
you know that.
What are you
talking about?

37:09.227 --> 37:11.530
We got hits across the board.
You sound stupid right now.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.031
I'm not talking
about music!

37:13.064 --> 37:14.466
The feds is gonna come

37:14.500 --> 37:15.901
and they're gonna start
knocking the doors

37:15.934 --> 37:17.603
all down and around
this place.

37:17.636 --> 37:18.870
I love you, okay?

37:18.904 --> 37:20.406
I love you.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.073
But I'm not
letting my career

37:22.107 --> 37:23.942
go down with
this building.

37:23.975 --> 37:25.844
And you shouldn't either.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.282
*

37:36.288 --> 37:38.123
Not sure you should be
mixing those with Scotch.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.660
I sure am doing it
tonight, though.

37:41.693 --> 37:42.961
(chuckles)

37:45.263 --> 37:47.098
Been lying to myself,
y'all, 'cause...

37:49.267 --> 37:51.903
Walking around, acting
like everything's cool,

37:51.937 --> 37:53.138
just managing
a little pain,

37:53.171 --> 37:55.240
but...

37:55.273 --> 37:57.776
When I was up on the stage
at the Empire XStream event,

37:57.809 --> 38:01.513
I could see the lights
just flashing, flashing...

38:03.882 --> 38:05.116
And then Freda.

38:09.321 --> 38:10.922
It was wack.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.024
PTSD.

38:13.058 --> 38:14.460
Man...

38:14.493 --> 38:16.261
everybody messed up.

38:16.294 --> 38:19.598
Ain't nobody as messed up as
the Lyon brothers, I'm sorry.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.533
(all chuckling)

38:21.567 --> 38:23.902
But you know what we got
that nobody else does?

38:25.036 --> 38:26.304
We got each other.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.008
So here is how we win.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.344
Jamal... you gonna
beat this.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.680
Say it.

38:34.713 --> 38:36.114
I'm gonna beat this.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.383
Say it like you mean it.
Come on, man.

38:37.416 --> 38:38.650
I'm gonna beat this.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.118
You're back onstage
in no time.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.520
Hakeem...

38:42.854 --> 38:45.290
...you're a father.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.258
First of the Lyon sons.

38:49.395 --> 38:50.862
If you're ready
to step up,

38:50.896 --> 38:52.864
we got your back.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.299
You ready?

38:54.332 --> 38:56.034
I'm ready.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.235
ANDRE:
Say it again.

38:57.268 --> 38:58.804
I'm ready.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.406
Say it like a man, son.
You ready?

39:00.439 --> 39:02.073
I'm ready.
Yeah, my man.

39:02.107 --> 39:03.509
To Baby Bella.

39:03.542 --> 39:04.810
To Bella.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.878
To my daughter.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.847
To Ma.

39:11.617 --> 39:12.851
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

39:12.884 --> 39:14.119
Ah...

39:16.254 --> 39:17.623
HAKEEM:
What about you, Dre?

39:22.694 --> 39:23.929
Rhonda.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.365
I gotta get her out of my head.

39:27.399 --> 39:28.600
(inhales)

39:28.634 --> 39:30.502
So tomorrow,

39:30.536 --> 39:32.337
I'm gonna go
to our old place

39:32.370 --> 39:35.240
and I'm grabbing
the last of my stuff.

39:35.273 --> 39:37.543
*

39:41.780 --> 39:43.782
(distant siren wailing,
neighbors shouting faintly)

39:56.662 --> 39:58.764
* And you said
he's just a friend *

39:58.797 --> 40:01.366
* And you said he's just
a friend *

40:01.399 --> 40:03.569
* Oh, baby...
How many times
I got to tell you

40:03.602 --> 40:05.437
to stay away from that boy?

40:05.471 --> 40:06.772
But, Ma, you said
he's my brother.

40:06.805 --> 40:08.039
Tariq, you listen to me.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.408
You do not ever, ever

40:10.442 --> 40:13.745
say that out loud again,
not to anybody.

40:13.779 --> 40:15.313
Least of all to him.

40:15.346 --> 40:18.049
He may be
your half brother,

40:18.083 --> 40:19.284
but he is
not your friend.

40:19.317 --> 40:22.087
Him and his crazy-ass mama

40:22.120 --> 40:24.089
are the worst thing
that ever happened to us.

40:44.710 --> 40:45.977
(Bella fusses)

40:54.452 --> 40:56.454
(static crackles)

41:00.191 --> 41:02.193
(static crackles)

41:12.538 --> 41:14.540
(static crackles)

41:16.407 --> 41:18.009
(static crackles)

41:19.344 --> 41:20.579
(static crackles)

41:22.848 --> 41:24.850
(static crackles)

41:26.518 --> 41:27.753
(static crackles)

41:40.999 --> 41:44.135
You know what
I was thinking?

41:44.169 --> 41:47.305
We got all these
beautiful stuffed animals

41:47.338 --> 41:49.975
for our little girl.

41:50.008 --> 41:52.477
What in the world
are we doing with

41:52.510 --> 41:54.112
this thirsty-looking bear?

41:59.851 --> 42:03.454
Let's get Bella something
more befitting a princess.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.091
(static crackles)

42:09.695 --> 42:12.197
(exhales)

42:12.230 --> 42:14.232
*

42:22.473 --> 42:24.375
(tires screech, siren whoops)

42:28.079 --> 42:29.380
Hey, Officer.

42:29.414 --> 42:31.082
Step away from the car.

42:31.116 --> 42:32.618
Oh, no. No, sir,
I live right there.

42:32.651 --> 42:33.885
I mean I, uh,

42:33.919 --> 42:35.186
I used to live
right there.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.355
Lot of break-ins
in this neighborhood.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.724
You know anything about that?

42:45.163 --> 42:46.732
No, Officer, I don't know
anything about that.

42:46.765 --> 42:48.433
Why would I know
anything about that?

42:48.466 --> 42:50.535
What are you doing around here?
Like I told you,

42:50.568 --> 42:52.070
I used to live right there.

42:52.103 --> 42:54.305
Got any ID on you, yo?

42:59.144 --> 43:01.579
My wallet's in my car...

43:01.613 --> 43:03.014
yo.

43:04.349 --> 43:05.450
Oh, so you're a smartass, then.

43:05.483 --> 43:06.785
Huh. Smartass, okay.

43:06.818 --> 43:08.486
I'm moving, okay? I'm moving.
Hands on the vehicle.

43:08.519 --> 43:10.121
I don't have time for this.
Hey... would you
listen to me?

43:10.155 --> 43:11.657
Get your hands off me, man!

43:11.690 --> 43:12.891
(grunting)

43:12.924 --> 43:14.392
Hands behind
your back!
Ah!

43:14.425 --> 43:16.061
Stop resisting!

43:16.094 --> 43:18.930
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say...

43:18.964 --> 43:20.766
(Andre screaming)

43:20.799 --> 43:21.800
You're resisting, boy.

43:21.833 --> 43:24.970
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.

44:00.038 --> 44:01.039
Yeah.

44:05.476 --> 44:07.145
ANNOUNCER: You've just
watched Empire.

44:07.178 --> 44:09.915
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:11.649 --> 44:13.719
Do you two have any idea
what this number is?

44:13.752 --> 44:16.154
-Last night's winning Lotto.
-The number of cats
in your apartment.

44:16.187 --> 44:20.992
It's the amount of money
you two cost the city
working together for three days.

44:21.026 --> 44:23.594
You've been on the job 25 years.
Not a nick on you.

44:24.730 --> 44:26.531
You get partnered with Riggs
three days,

44:26.564 --> 44:29.467
you crashed two cars
and nearly got yourself killed.

44:29.500 --> 44:33.338
-You ever feel like you made
the wrong career choice?
-Yeah, the day I met you.

44:33.371 --> 44:36.141
ANNOUNCER:
Lethal Weapon. Wednesdays.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.576
Man, take
the damn shades off!

44:38.609 --> 44:40.211
Man, put the damn shades
back on.

44:40.245 --> 44:41.112
On Fox.
