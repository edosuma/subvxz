WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:02.768
- I still can't find out
what the connection is.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.437
Accountants, bikers,
3d guns, mexico,

00:05.473 --> 00:07.906
I have no clue
what is going on.

00:07.942 --> 00:09.775
- Want to walk it
through together?

00:09.777 --> 00:11.810
- What the hell?!

00:11.812 --> 00:13.379
- Please don't.
- What is this, like,

00:13.514 --> 00:15.013
A five-point plan
for making friends?

00:15.148 --> 00:16.715
- No, it is not, okay?
It is not that.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.385
It's a... Vision board
for people that I like

00:19.520 --> 00:21.319
And you should probably
take it as a compliment.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.921
- Oh, so it's like an ocd thing.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.656
- Good girl.
- What does he have to do

00:24.658 --> 00:25.791
With marc the biker?

00:25.926 --> 00:27.793
- Let's not stereotype,
he could be very, very scary.

00:27.795 --> 00:30.395
- Poopy. Poopy.

00:30.464 --> 00:33.332
- I highly doubt he shot anyone,
especially gabrielle.

00:33.467 --> 00:36.735
- Wow, len. Some things
really haven't changed.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.570
- That's not mine.
- Come on.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.440
- Kelly, it's not mine. Alright?
Marc gave it to me to sell.

00:41.509 --> 00:42.907
Hey, for real.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.477
I've been sober two years now.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.412
- Yeah, elliot's here.
There's no sign of jackie.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.648
- Jackie bailed, she had
some side hustle going on,

00:49.783 --> 00:51.149
She didn't even tell me.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.519
(sighing)

00:59.226 --> 01:01.793
- Gosh, I'm so sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry!

01:01.829 --> 01:04.362
- Ten minutes late.
Never thought I'd see the day.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.164
- I was looking into our
accountant friend, adam gentle,

01:06.233 --> 01:07.566
And you will not believe
what I found out.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.568
- Uh-uh. Nope.
- Wait 'til you hear it!

01:09.570 --> 01:11.070
- No work talk!

01:11.205 --> 01:13.305
Hey, can we get
another round, please?

01:13.440 --> 01:15.707
Axe-throwing was your
vision board wet dream, okay?

01:15.709 --> 01:17.375
So you might as well enjoy it.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.247
Come on!

01:22.316 --> 01:24.816
- You know what I really enjoy?
I enjoy talking about work.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.385
(sighs)
- alright, fine.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.787
How about this?

01:28.789 --> 01:30.322
You hit that target...
- Yeah?

01:30.324 --> 01:31.924
- ...You can talk about
whatever you want to.

01:31.926 --> 01:32.924
- For real?
- Yeah.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.326
- Okay.

01:34.461 --> 01:35.660
- Just that easy?

01:35.696 --> 01:36.694
- I don't know.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.100
- Not bad.

01:42.103 --> 01:43.668
- Well, that's probably
just beginner's luck.

01:43.704 --> 01:47.206
(sing-song): Right. What do
I want to talk about?

01:47.341 --> 01:49.207
Oh, what do I want
to talk about?

01:49.243 --> 01:51.376
It can be anything,
it can be anything.

01:51.378 --> 01:54.179
'cause you said! Here it is.

01:54.181 --> 01:57.815
Why are you so sunshiny and
uncharacteristically chipper?

01:57.852 --> 01:59.718
- I dunno.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.619
- You dunno?
What'd you do last night?

02:01.655 --> 02:04.022
- Nothing much.
Just hung out with len.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.424
You do not get to judge, okay?

02:06.426 --> 02:08.894
If I wanted someone to judge me,
I'd call my sister.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.162
- I'm not judging,

02:10.164 --> 02:11.897
And karina would judge
you because she cares.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.833
'cause len really, I just
feel like... I'm gonna say it.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.301
He's a terrible boyfriend.

02:16.303 --> 02:20.272
- First off, not my boyfriend.
Secondly, friends don't judge.

02:20.274 --> 02:22.307
- Friends judge.
Oh, you know what?

02:22.309 --> 02:23.609
Maybe best friends don't judge.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.044
(gasping)
oh, my god!

02:26.180 --> 02:27.779
Am I your best friend?

02:27.848 --> 02:29.214
(laughing)

02:31.385 --> 02:33.252
(grunting)
- oh, okay.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.253
That was some bad luck.
Not that I'm judging.

02:41.462 --> 02:42.460
- Okay.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.862
- What did you guys do?

02:43.864 --> 02:47.599
- I mean, we went for pizza.
We talked.

02:47.635 --> 02:50.468
You know, he's doing good.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.937
The sober thing is real.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.705
- You don't think he's trying
to lure you back in?

02:53.840 --> 02:55.540
- He's not going to, alright?

02:55.576 --> 02:58.243
I admit, in the beginning,
I was concerned

02:58.378 --> 03:00.679
That feelings would get
caught up and everything,

03:00.748 --> 03:03.682
But I feel like it's closure.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.684
You know?
Like I can finally move on.

03:05.753 --> 03:08.886
- Good. You know what, I'm glad.
I just hope you're right.

03:08.923 --> 03:10.688
- Listen...

03:10.724 --> 03:14.826
If I start falling
for his games, okay?

03:14.828 --> 03:16.761
You have my permission
to call me out on it.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.297
Okay, but...
- What?

03:19.333 --> 03:21.033
- On these conditions.
- Yes.

03:21.168 --> 03:22.433
- Privately.
- Of course.

03:22.469 --> 03:24.036
- One time.
- One time.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.638
- And you can't be
so annoying about it.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.640
- I'm never annoying.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.908
It would be my absolute honour.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.944
And you know what,
if he does step out of line...

03:36.717 --> 03:39.284
- Okay, okay, what?

03:39.286 --> 03:40.952
- You know what,
I think I remember you saying

03:40.988 --> 03:42.721
That you would pay
if I was winning.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.688
I think I'm winning.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.923
Hey, hi! I'm winning,

03:45.960 --> 03:48.660
So my bff over here
is gonna cover it.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.330
(chuckling)
oh, it's cool, you still got

03:51.332 --> 03:52.997
Two hours left
on your tab from this week.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.466
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

03:54.468 --> 03:56.134
Wait, how many times
has she been here already?

03:56.203 --> 03:58.003
- Never.
- This week!

03:58.005 --> 03:59.937
- Nuh-uh, I've never been here,
this is the first time.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.873
- Monday, Tuesday, Thursday?

04:01.909 --> 04:03.541
- None of it is true.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.210
- Mmm...
- Okay, you know what?

04:05.279 --> 04:07.546
I only came because I was
scoping out the place!

04:07.681 --> 04:09.147
Like, is this place good
enough for duff?

04:09.183 --> 04:10.749
- Scoping out the place...
- I wanted to see,

04:10.884 --> 04:12.284
Does she like this lane?
Does she like--

04:12.419 --> 04:13.485
(shouting)

04:13.620 --> 04:15.153
♪ I'm gonna run to you ♪

04:16.257 --> 04:18.623
♪ I'm gonna run to you ♪

04:20.361 --> 04:22.361
♪ 'cause when
the feeling's right ♪

04:22.496 --> 04:24.029
♪ I'm gonna run all night ♪

04:24.098 --> 04:26.297
Sorry, I didn't eat breakfast

04:26.333 --> 04:29.434
Because my mom threw out
all the refined sugar.

04:29.503 --> 04:32.170
- You know where you can find
a decent meal, right?

04:32.306 --> 04:33.572
Casa de nazeer.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.741
The guy can seriously cook,
wazowski.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.943
And I bet he has spoons, too.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.578
- Do you want some?
- No, seriously,

04:39.713 --> 04:41.146
I need you to get some,

04:41.148 --> 04:42.581
Because I cannot
stand to see you

04:42.716 --> 04:44.115
Tongue kiss that yogurt again.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.718
- Oh, look who it is. So...

04:46.720 --> 04:49.187
Results are in on
the pink cocaine len gave you.

04:49.189 --> 04:52.057
Marc's coke and the pandilla
quince coke from the airplane,

04:52.059 --> 04:53.725
Drum roll please.

04:54.862 --> 04:57.662
- Ha!
- Same stuff, it's a match.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.532
- So the sons of jupiter
and pandilla quince

05:00.534 --> 05:01.867
Are working together.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.069
- Then we have adam gentle,
financial advisor, mba,

05:04.138 --> 05:05.637
Proud father to a hairless dog,
who frankly

05:05.706 --> 05:06.738
Dresses better than I do.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.373
No, I don't want to hear it.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.275
I have a spin team
on the house already.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.943
- He's not our shooter.
- Probably not,

05:12.079 --> 05:13.478
But he crunches numbers
for marc tremblay

05:13.547 --> 05:15.947
Of the sons of jupiter,
and opp intel suggests

05:15.949 --> 05:18.683
He has ties to
pandilla quince associates.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.151
So, we get him,

05:20.220 --> 05:21.753
We get him to turn
on his criminal buddies.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.288
- Might not be that easy.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.490
I was just talking to one
of my buddies down in fraud.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.158
She's been looking into gentle,
but can never get him

05:27.227 --> 05:28.960
On anything, he's too good.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.763
They say he launders
my annual salary on a Tuesday.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.433
- Yeah, well, we are not fraud.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.234
Why? 'cause we are
better than them.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.668
(chuckling)

05:38.772 --> 05:42.407
Hi there, may I please
speak to adam gentle?

05:42.409 --> 05:44.342
Oh, yes, hey there, how are you?

05:44.378 --> 05:47.446
I hear you are the best
money man in town...

05:47.448 --> 05:50.615
Oh no, cost is not an issue.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.783
(chuckling)

05:52.686 --> 05:54.119
I see.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.054
Yeah, but if we could just...
Hello?

05:56.123 --> 05:57.122
Oh, okay.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.057
He only takes referrals.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.192
- Mm-hmm. That's what you get
for being cocky.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.195
- Ooh, pow-pow.
- We're gonna find a way in,

06:03.197 --> 06:04.495
We'll just look for a weak link.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.999
(sighing)
- sam. We already have a way in.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.534
Len can get in through marc.

06:09.669 --> 06:12.371
- Uh, no thank you.
You are not working with len.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.272
- I can work with len, okay?

06:14.308 --> 06:15.707
(scoffing)

06:15.709 --> 06:17.475
I just can't
go out with him.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.343
(whispering):
Work is a gateway drug.

06:19.380 --> 06:22.547
- Look, if we're gonna clear
richie, this is our best shot.

06:22.616 --> 06:25.016
Okay, I can take care of myself.
Ask the fellas.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.619
Hey guys, I can take care
of myself, right?

06:27.621 --> 06:29.987
- Oh, I'm not getting
involved in that one.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.090
- Kelly is very good
at taking care of herself.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.193
Maybe too good, if you ask me.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.105
- Uh-oh.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.540
- Morning, inspector.
- Hmm. Hold on.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.579
Mmm.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.347
Okay, lay it on me.

06:57.684 --> 07:00.051
- Davidson & mcconnell
filed an official complaint

07:00.120 --> 07:02.254
Against you this morning.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.989
(laughing)

07:04.124 --> 07:05.890
- Tyrannical behaviour.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.060
- Edwina, you're on
solid ground here.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.195
I'll deal with it at unit level.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.331
There's no reason for command
to get involved, okay?

07:13.333 --> 07:15.600
- I appreciate it.
- Hey.

07:15.735 --> 07:17.235
If we can't count
on each other...

07:20.407 --> 07:22.006
- I think we're
overdue for dinner.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.442
What are you doing next week?

07:23.577 --> 07:26.611
- Heading over there,
on one condition.

07:26.647 --> 07:29.214
And that is
if elizabeth is cooking.

07:29.349 --> 07:32.150
Because still recovering
from the pepperpot last year.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.586
(laughing, mimicking gagging)

07:34.588 --> 07:35.787
- Deal!

07:35.856 --> 07:38.789
- In the meantime,
just ignore those two.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.492
We don't want things
to escalate, okay?

07:40.494 --> 07:42.127
- Don't worry,
I've been around too long

07:42.129 --> 07:43.728
To let those fools get to me.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.231
- Okay.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.169
(sighing)

07:51.304 --> 07:52.837
- Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.706
How is marc not suspicious
about you setting up

07:54.775 --> 07:56.708
The meeting with adam?
- No, he's been after me

07:56.777 --> 07:58.043
To invest my money
for weeks now,

07:58.178 --> 07:59.578
I made it seem like
it was his idea.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.580
I figure between the two of us,
we can keep adam busy

08:01.715 --> 08:03.448
Long enough to stay out
of the house for 30 minutes.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.049
- No, I'm gonna run
things from the van.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.518
You're going in alone.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.186
- Oh...

08:08.255 --> 08:09.988
You know we work
better as a team.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.723
Remember the sex club?
- You know, len,

08:11.725 --> 08:14.258
Sometimes being part of a team
is knowing when to go in alone.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.194
- Or when to stay in your lane.
- Exactly, and sometimes

08:16.329 --> 08:18.430
Staying your lane leads
to a different part of the play

08:18.432 --> 08:20.398
Than saying in your lane, okay?

08:20.534 --> 08:22.133
- She always like this,
or just when she needs

08:22.202 --> 08:24.602
A manager to speak with?
- Hilarious, great, I'm a karen.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.471
Like I haven't been
called that before.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.740
- I missed that smile.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.612
(sighing)

08:36.750 --> 08:38.149
(phone vibrating)
- are you gonna open up

08:38.285 --> 08:39.850
The letters from these schools?

08:40.887 --> 08:42.220
(sighing)

08:43.257 --> 08:44.455
- What would be the point?

08:45.726 --> 08:47.759
Even if I got in,
mom's not gonna pay for it now.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.094
- Don't be ridiculous.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.262
Come here, baby boy.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.166
You show her those
acceptance letters,

08:55.235 --> 08:58.236
Maybe do a few chores
around the house,

08:58.371 --> 09:01.172
How could she resist
this beautiful face?

09:03.710 --> 09:04.876
(sighing)

09:05.011 --> 09:06.845
Dolly boy. I get it.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.647
I miss jackie too,
I love that girl.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.449
- Yeah, I never want
to see her again.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.250
- You're lying.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.522
You're lying,
I can see ls in your eyes.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.391
You call her back.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.859
Who knows why
she did what she did?

09:21.895 --> 09:23.461
Maybe she had a good reason.

09:24.398 --> 09:27.999
- Nah. I think I'm just done.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.403
(both sigh)

09:34.308 --> 09:35.606
- Oh, for god's sake.

09:35.642 --> 09:37.174
- Hey, barb.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.814
(laughing)

09:42.883 --> 09:44.415
- Look at you!

09:44.451 --> 09:46.751
- I'm sorry, I didn't
know who else to call.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.820
- Oh no, don't you dare
apologize.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.488
I promised your mom
I would check in on you!

09:50.524 --> 09:52.357
- How's she doing?
- Well, you know,

09:52.426 --> 09:54.292
She'd be better
if you visited her.

09:54.361 --> 09:55.826
- I actually have some money
for her lawyers,

09:55.862 --> 09:58.029
I was hoping maybe
you'd be able to get it to her.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.766
- Jesus, jackie, honey,
you know I can't get tangled up

10:01.768 --> 10:03.534
In this again.
- No, no, no, it's my money,

10:03.604 --> 10:05.303
I've been saving up for it.
Her lawyers aren't gonna ask

10:05.438 --> 10:07.105
Any questions about it,
they just kinda need a retainer.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.240
Essentially,
there's about 90k in here,

10:09.376 --> 10:11.743
Should be more than enough.
I would really appreciate it

10:11.878 --> 10:14.912
If maybe she didn't
know where it came from.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.583
- Hey, jackie!

10:18.718 --> 10:22.720
- Yo, shanika!
Girl, good to see you!

10:22.756 --> 10:25.256
Look at you, all grown up.
- Tell me about it.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.992
Two more months 'til barb's
gotta give me the boot.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.393
- Why? What's two months?
- That's when she turns 18,

10:29.429 --> 10:31.730
And then she is outta here!
(chuckling)

10:31.865 --> 10:34.866
But she knows, she's always
got an open door with me.

10:35.001 --> 10:36.534
- Speaking of open doors,

10:36.670 --> 10:38.269
Please tell me
you're staying here.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.937
- No, I'm gonna crash
on a friend's couch.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.872
I couldn't, I don't wanna do...
- No, no! Don't be silly.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.908
Your mom would kill me
if I didn't take you in.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.177
You can bunk with shanika.
- Barb, you got so many kids

10:46.312 --> 10:48.312
Under your roof already.
There's no way!

10:48.348 --> 10:50.615
- I know, that's why
I could use the help.

10:50.617 --> 10:51.615
(laughing)

10:54.287 --> 10:56.420
- For the record,
I have never been to a sex club.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.690
And if I had, I would not
be reminiscing about it

10:58.692 --> 10:59.691
In front of my colleagues.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.693
- Oh, my god.
It was a drug bust.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.027
Just chill out, alright?

11:03.096 --> 11:05.830
Besides, I told you, I'm good.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.772
How's it looking?

11:13.907 --> 11:16.574
- Security company
shut the system down remotely.

11:16.576 --> 11:19.310
Len's at the restaurant,
adam's on his way now.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.045
- Len couldn't have picked
a place farther away?

11:21.114 --> 11:22.647
We can practically see
the restaurant from here.

11:22.782 --> 11:24.782
- He's doing us a favour.
Play nice.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.152
- I am nice! It's one
of my defining qualities.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.453
Look...

11:39.166 --> 11:40.265
- So len, huh?

11:41.234 --> 11:42.200
- He's a good cop.

11:42.269 --> 11:45.302
- Kelly.
- Stop. It's work.

11:50.677 --> 11:53.611
Anyway, it's not
like you're available.

11:53.647 --> 11:56.013
(suspenseful music)

12:09.362 --> 12:11.663
<i> (sam): Test, testing.</i>
<i> Test, test, testing.</i>

12:11.798 --> 12:13.631
- Loud and clear.
- Red leather, yellow leather.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.266
Susie sells seashells
by the sea shore.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.301
- Sam, I got it, move on.

12:16.436 --> 12:17.502
- Okay, okay.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.803
(barking)
ahh! Oh.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.672
Hi, very nice to meet you.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.042
You seem like a very sweet
thing, whatever you... A dog.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.044
I think you're a dog.
So, so nice to meet you.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.513
So, if you could just here.
Come, come, come.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.648
(barking)
okay, great.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.117
- All good in there?

12:33.653 --> 12:35.253
- Oh gosh.
(dog growling)

12:35.255 --> 12:38.323
Whoa, this guy has some
really weird hobbies.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.124
<i> (kelly): Nix the sightseeing,</i>
<i> alright?</i>

12:40.193 --> 12:42.326
Focus on the study.
It's where he meets clients.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.862
- Focused.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.197
(growling)

12:50.403 --> 12:51.936
(barking)

12:52.773 --> 12:54.638
(phone vibrating)

12:56.142 --> 13:00.278
<i> (len): Hey, listen, babe.</i>
<i> I might be home late.</i>

13:00.280 --> 13:01.980
- What's wrong?

13:02.115 --> 13:03.514
<i> - Change of plans,</i>

13:03.583 --> 13:05.216
<i> He doesn't like my</i>
<i> choice of restaurant,</i>

13:05.218 --> 13:06.750
<i> Not that I blame him.</i>

13:06.787 --> 13:08.953
<i> So, we're gonna head over</i>
<i> to the accountant's house now.</i>

13:09.790 --> 13:11.222
- Define "now".

13:11.291 --> 13:13.491
(barking)
<i> (len): We're pulling up.</i>

13:13.626 --> 13:15.259
<i> See you at home.</i>

13:15.295 --> 13:16.927
(suspenseful music)

13:18.464 --> 13:20.431
<i> (nathan): Sam, get out</i>
<i> of there now!</i>

13:20.467 --> 13:22.033
(barking)

13:22.102 --> 13:23.568
- Um...

13:24.771 --> 13:26.037
Define "now".

13:32.312 --> 13:33.978
<i> (len): Great ride,</i>
<i> now that I'm looking at it,</i>

13:34.113 --> 13:35.146
<i> I understand...</i>

13:35.148 --> 13:37.315
- Hey, hey, what's the plan?!

13:37.384 --> 13:38.549
Kelly!

13:38.552 --> 13:39.950
- You've got
the red calipers, right?

13:39.986 --> 13:42.320
(kelly): Len! I caught you.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.788
I see you over there!

13:43.923 --> 13:46.123
This is your
accountant's house, right?

13:46.159 --> 13:48.926
Yeah... Let me guess,

13:48.995 --> 13:50.728
She must look
like a video vixen, huh?

13:50.764 --> 13:53.731
- Marie, please.
- Don't "please" me.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.333
- This is the accountant.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.336
- Oh, so what? I saw what
your lawyer friend looked like,

13:58.338 --> 14:00.305
And that didn't stop you from
trying to screw her either!

14:00.440 --> 14:03.608
<i> - Sam, plant the bug, clean up</i>
<i> and get the hell out of there.</i>

14:03.677 --> 14:05.476
<i> (sam): I'm gonna be a minute.</i>

14:05.512 --> 14:06.944
- Were you guys out
trying to meet women?

14:07.080 --> 14:08.713
- We just met ten minutes ago,

14:08.782 --> 14:11.449
We wouldn't have
even had the time

14:11.451 --> 14:12.717
Even if we wanted to.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.753
This is strictly platonic,
just for the record.

14:15.755 --> 14:18.089
<i> (kelly): I can't believe this</i>
<i> is happening to me again.</i>

14:18.158 --> 14:19.556
<i> I can't believe...</i>

14:19.593 --> 14:21.926
- Hey, hey.
What I did was inexcusable.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.561
But I'm not going back
there ever, okay?

14:23.563 --> 14:25.229
- Excuse me?

14:25.298 --> 14:27.164
(kelly sobbing):
I can trust you?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.766
- You can trust me.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.301
- I need to check on henrietta.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.769
- Mr. Accountant,
wait, one second, one second!

14:31.838 --> 14:34.105
<i>I wanna ask you something else!</i>
<i> (adam): Where are you?!</i>

14:34.107 --> 14:35.373
(barking)

14:35.508 --> 14:37.375
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

14:37.444 --> 14:39.377
What has gotten into you today?

14:39.446 --> 14:40.611
(whining)

14:41.815 --> 14:44.381
<i> Why don't we reschedule?</i>

14:44.417 --> 14:49.186
<i> I think I need to take</i>
<i> henrietta for a little walk.</i>

14:49.222 --> 14:50.721
- Great idea.
- Mm-hmm.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.523
(dog barking)

14:52.525 --> 14:55.193
- Let's go out.
Find some trouble.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.762
- I'm trying to stay
out of trouble.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.197
- If you guys are looking
for something to do,

15:00.233 --> 15:02.066
I have a five-pound
bag of potatoes

15:02.102 --> 15:04.468
That needs to be peeled.
- Actually...

15:04.504 --> 15:06.337
I do have something to do.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.138
- I'm coming with you.
Sorry, we gotta run barb.

15:08.174 --> 15:11.342
- Aren't you guys
forgetting something?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.910
Condoms, dental dams.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.013
- Oh, I don't need those.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.548
- Yeah, that's what
caden's mama said.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.916
Stock up.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.151
Not until you're 16.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.420
- Ageist.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.960
- Bye!
- Bye, guys.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.564
- Isn't it nice to get out
every now and then?

15:34.367 --> 15:35.600
Ah!
(snapping)

15:35.735 --> 15:37.801
I'd like to see
your mulch selection.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.676
(wind chimes clanging)

15:50.583 --> 15:53.117
- Elliot, I'm so sorry.
- What are you doing here?

15:53.119 --> 15:54.585
- Listen.
- I don't wanna talk to you.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.053
- Listen, listen, listen.
I needed the money

15:56.089 --> 15:58.589
For my mom's appeal. The cops
would've confiscated it.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.925
I cannot leave her in jail.

16:01.060 --> 16:02.826
- Okay. Why didn't you
tell me this before?

16:02.862 --> 16:04.595
- I didn't even know
what I was gonna...

16:04.597 --> 16:06.397
- Right.
- ...Do it until...

16:07.434 --> 16:08.599
(sighing)

16:08.635 --> 16:11.002
Your family is amazing.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.204
And for a second, I thought
I could even be part of it.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.006
But the thing is,
they're always

16:15.141 --> 16:18.008
Going to look at me
like I am a criminal.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.877
And the truth is,

16:19.879 --> 16:22.613
A lot of the time, I think
you're better off without me.

16:22.615 --> 16:26.351
- So you didn't think I'd want a
say in any of this at all?

16:26.486 --> 16:29.287
Because I specifically remember
my life being a lot better

16:29.289 --> 16:31.289
With you in it.
- Can I make it up to you then?

16:31.424 --> 16:33.457
Can we just start over?
- I'm already starting over.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.759
I'm gonna go to school.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.429
Or, I don't know,
live in some stupid residence

16:38.498 --> 16:40.364
And join a frat house
or something.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.366
Okay?

16:43.770 --> 16:46.170
All the dumb stuff I was gonna
do before you ruined my life.

16:46.305 --> 16:49.207
- I thought you said you liked
your life better with me in it.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.509
- Yeah, I did.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.045
But you ruined it, so...

16:54.847 --> 16:56.246
- It's cute, right?

16:56.282 --> 16:58.315
I can put it in our room.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.119
- I wouldn't trust
jackie to water that.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.256
- Who's that?

17:07.326 --> 17:09.059
- It doesn't matter.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.196
- That was like old times.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.798
- Tell the truth,
that felt good.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.267
- Yeah, just like all those
times I've saved your ass,

17:16.269 --> 17:17.535
What was that, the 100th time?

17:17.670 --> 17:19.503
- Listen, I told you,
we're better as a team.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.739
- That's debatable.
- Sorry, let me get that.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.006
- What?
- This.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.342
- Gimme that!
- This? Too late.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.278
- Hi.
(len): See you in there!

17:27.280 --> 17:29.614
- How are you? Can I talk
to you just for a second?

17:29.616 --> 17:31.949
No, no, please, wait, no.
I'm worried, duff.

17:31.951 --> 17:35.152
Okay, I'm sounding the alarm.
Woop, woop, ding, ding, ding!

17:35.188 --> 17:36.654
- No. Don't need it.
- Hey, listen.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.322
You said I could call you on it!

17:38.324 --> 17:40.257
This is me, calling you.
Boop, boop, boop!

17:40.259 --> 17:41.959
Hey duff, please pick up.

17:41.995 --> 17:43.761
- Alright, naz, we up?
- Yeah.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.196
He hasn't done anything
that interesting.

17:46.232 --> 17:49.000
He vacuumed, let his dog lick
his mouth, and that's about it.

17:49.135 --> 17:50.868
- Kelly and I got
night shift covered.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.636
- Cool.

17:53.807 --> 17:56.441
- Yeah, why don't you two
go and do your own thing?

17:58.511 --> 17:59.243
- No.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.846
- No, I got a different thing.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.915
- I just don't want
to miss any developments.

18:04.951 --> 18:08.619
Yeah, in it to win it.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.393
(popcorn crunching)

18:17.564 --> 18:20.465
- Oh my gosh, can you stop
masticating so loudly?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.299
(door buzzing)

18:23.269 --> 18:24.201
(crunching)

18:24.270 --> 18:25.870
I can still hear you.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.672
<i> - Hey.</i>

18:28.708 --> 18:29.841
- Hey, I've seen
that guy before.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.308
- Niccolo carbone.

18:31.310 --> 18:32.709
<i>- I need a favour off the books.</i>

18:32.745 --> 18:34.412
<i> - How much?</i>
<i> - 30 gs.</i>

18:34.547 --> 18:36.280
- Hot-headed new wave mafioso.
I tell you,

18:36.349 --> 18:38.882
If you could arrest a guy
on arrogance alone...

18:38.918 --> 18:41.018
- This doesn't make any sense.
- Agreed.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.920
Sons of jupiter
won't touch the mob.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.354
They see those guys,
they cross the street.

18:44.390 --> 18:47.091
There's no way they'd be
willing to share an accountant.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.992
<i> - I don't keep</i>
<i> anything on site here.</i>

18:49.028 --> 18:52.429
<i> But I could possibly arrange</i>
<i> for a drop-off this weekend.</i>

18:52.431 --> 18:53.898
- Yeah, if adam's been
playing both sides,

18:54.033 --> 18:55.366
He got bigger balls
than I ever thought.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.101
<i> - That's my man!</i>

18:57.170 --> 18:59.237
<i> I love you, brother.</i>
<i> - Love you too.</i>

19:00.406 --> 19:01.705
<i> - You said you'd think</i>
<i> about game night.</i>

19:01.741 --> 19:05.176
<i> - Oh, yeah. Yes, for sure.</i>

19:05.178 --> 19:07.178
<i> Brother, of course,</i>
<i> I'm looking forward to it.</i>

19:07.180 --> 19:08.379
<i> - Great.</i>
<i> - Hey, listen,</i>

19:08.514 --> 19:10.915
<i> You just focus on</i>
<i> getting me that capital,</i>

19:10.917 --> 19:13.584
<i> We're gonna make a plan, hmm?</i>

19:15.088 --> 19:16.921
- Wait, wait, wait,
run that back.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.322
Run it back, run it back.

19:18.457 --> 19:20.124
<i> - We're gonna make a plan.</i>
- Did you see that?

19:20.259 --> 19:22.526
Was that some kind of gang sign
or something, wazowski?

19:22.595 --> 19:24.996
- I've never seen it before.
I'm not yawning.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.531
It's just that this room
is short on oxygen.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.400
Because it is so crowded.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.936
- Well, why don't you go home
where there's bigger space?

19:31.938 --> 19:33.537
- That's okay.
- We're fine.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.540
- No, I don't know
if you will...

19:37.443 --> 19:39.309
(inaudible conversation)

19:41.447 --> 19:44.348
(soft music)

19:45.885 --> 19:47.484
(indistinct chattering)

19:47.554 --> 19:49.954
Hey guys, 'sup? Uh...

19:50.023 --> 19:51.455
I'm just about to head home,

19:51.591 --> 19:53.357
And I was wondering
if you could just do me

19:53.492 --> 19:55.059
A tiny, teeny,
mini little favour?

19:55.061 --> 19:57.361
Could you just check in on
duff before you leave?

19:57.496 --> 20:00.431
'cause she's got a night shift
with you-know-who.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.466
- Kelly doesn't want
anyone to check on her.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.135
Least of all me.
- Okay, I get it.

20:04.137 --> 20:05.770
You don't want
to come across as jealous.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.238
I totally understand. Naz?

20:07.373 --> 20:09.106
- You're very cute.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.175
But I'm not getting
involved in this one.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.010
- Are you kidding me?
What if I was about to

20:13.079 --> 20:14.512
Fall off a cliff?
Are you gonna do something?

20:14.514 --> 20:16.247
Or you just gonna stand there,
throw up your hands,

20:16.382 --> 20:18.482
"oh god, it's your life.
Hope you don't die!"

20:18.518 --> 20:21.319
- Kelly's not standing
on a cliff, she's skydiving.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.587
We need to trust her
to handle her business.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.589
- Yeah, and even
if we did say something,

20:25.592 --> 20:27.458
It's not like
she'd listen to any of us.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.659
- Listen, there's gotta
be someone

20:28.794 --> 20:30.560
That can get through to her.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.065
Bye.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.935
(gulls squawking)

20:43.676 --> 20:45.442
(vacuum buzzing)

20:48.648 --> 20:50.147
(indistinct chattering)

20:50.149 --> 20:52.149
(len and kelly laughing)

20:52.218 --> 20:55.552
- That is sad. Who buys
a vacuum for their crumbs?

20:55.554 --> 20:57.755
- Twenty bucks,
I bet you wazowski has one.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.556
- You guys have
excellent timing.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.158
You arrived perfectly in sync.

21:01.227 --> 21:02.760
I love that band.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.762
- Yeah, because we met
in the parking lot.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.931
<i> - Can I have a technician</i>
<i> sent out here today, please?</i>

21:06.933 --> 21:08.231
<i> I restarted the router,</i>

21:08.268 --> 21:10.167
<i> But the connection</i>
<i> is acting weird.</i>

21:10.169 --> 21:13.037
- His connection, do you think
our equipment screwed it up?

21:13.039 --> 21:15.573
- Either way, there's no way
a wireless tech

21:15.708 --> 21:17.708
Walks up in that place
and doesn't find our bugs.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.043
We gotta pull the plug, now.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.644
- We don't have
anything on him yet.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.447
- His stash.
His cash, his cash stash.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.849
Gentle told niccolo carbone
he keeps it off site,

21:25.885 --> 21:27.218
So we know it exists.

21:27.220 --> 21:28.853
- Alright, let's go
pay adam a visit.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.387
That money's dirty as hell.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.757
So if we find it, we have
grounds to confiscate it.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.425
He'll be in deep
with his clients.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.626
- I'll set up the meet.

21:35.695 --> 21:38.062
- No wait, the guy's
skittish, alright?

21:38.064 --> 21:40.331
This isn't slash-and-burn,
this is brain surgery.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.999
This time, I'm going in alone.

21:43.036 --> 21:45.102
(soft music)

21:47.206 --> 21:48.939
(indistinct chattering)

21:52.478 --> 21:54.378
- Karina.
(sighing)

21:54.447 --> 21:56.012
Wow.

21:56.049 --> 21:57.348
How's it going?

21:57.483 --> 21:59.417
- Alright, what's the occasion,
someone die?

22:03.222 --> 22:04.621
Wait, did someone actually die?

22:04.657 --> 22:06.290
- Kelly, you shouldn't even
be in the same building

22:06.292 --> 22:07.358
As this guy.

22:08.294 --> 22:09.727
- I'll be outside.
- Yeah.

22:10.596 --> 22:12.162
- Nice seeing you, karina.

22:16.402 --> 22:18.735
- Okay, I'm not doing this.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.104
- I am not not doing this.

22:20.173 --> 22:21.772
I drove all the way up here.

22:21.907 --> 22:23.441
Forty minutes just
to cross the border,

22:23.576 --> 22:25.909
And thanks to this baby,
I have to pee every 30 minutes.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.511
- Shh! Shh!

22:29.448 --> 22:30.915
- Okay, what?
- Oh, don't pretend

22:31.050 --> 22:32.315
This is no big deal.

22:32.352 --> 22:33.851
Have you forgotten
how much he messed you up?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.653
Sam was right to call me.

22:35.655 --> 22:38.255
- Sam called you?
Are you kidding me?

22:38.257 --> 22:40.457
Look, you don't get
to come and choose

22:40.593 --> 22:42.626
To be a sister
when you want to be, okay?

22:42.628 --> 22:44.461
I don't need your help.
- Len grierson knows

22:44.497 --> 22:46.597
All your buttons, kelly.
And he will press them.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.398
One week, you'll be
feeling sorry for him,

22:48.434 --> 22:50.000
Two weeks in,
you'll be back together,

22:50.002 --> 22:51.735
And he'll have you
thinking it was your idea.

22:51.804 --> 22:55.672
- Stop treating me
like I'm a helpless child!

22:55.708 --> 22:57.140
Okay?

22:57.176 --> 22:59.876
And he is not back in my life!

22:59.912 --> 23:03.046
It's work, karina.
It's just work!

23:03.682 --> 23:05.149
- Kelly.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.753
As much as I hate to say this,

23:10.823 --> 23:12.890
You're one of the smartest
people I know.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.092
But around that guy?

23:16.562 --> 23:17.895
You're an idiot.

23:21.033 --> 23:24.434
- Oh, idiot. Okay, well...

23:25.237 --> 23:27.037
You know what, karina?

23:27.073 --> 23:28.706
I think if you leave now,

23:28.841 --> 23:30.708
You might make it
back in time for lunch.

23:36.582 --> 23:37.715
- Okay.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.851
Believe it or not, kelly,
I was only trying to help.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.726
- Len, listen.

23:50.163 --> 23:53.597
If you do anything, I mean it,
anything to hurt kelly,

23:53.599 --> 23:55.799
I don't care if it's a paper
cut, or a mean little joke,

23:55.868 --> 23:58.401
Or you mess with her hair...
- That's not gonna happen.

23:58.438 --> 24:00.137
- Good. Because if it does,

24:00.206 --> 24:01.872
I'm gonna rip your intestines
out through your throat.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.008
- Graphic, but fair.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.878
- So we doing this or what?

24:09.882 --> 24:13.017
- She mad at you or me?
- Pretty sure that's me.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.559
- Hey, commander,
you got a minute?

24:21.561 --> 24:22.960
- What's wrong?

24:22.962 --> 24:24.695
- No, no, I was um...

24:24.764 --> 24:27.197
I could actually just
really use your advice.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.467
I'm trying to...

24:30.536 --> 24:33.036
You know, it's hard to know

24:33.105 --> 24:35.305
What one's place
is in something...

24:35.341 --> 24:38.041
Sometimes.
- Naz. Spit it out.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.713
- I'm trying
to decide when meddling

24:42.782 --> 24:44.448
Is part of my
professional duty,

24:44.583 --> 24:46.383
Or my friend duty,
or not my duty at all,

24:46.385 --> 24:47.717
And I should just
stay out of it.

24:47.753 --> 24:50.120
- Oh, are you talking
about kelly and len?

24:50.122 --> 24:51.588
Just... Mm-mm.

24:51.657 --> 24:54.257
- I'm talking about you,
commander.

24:54.927 --> 24:58.595
- Me? What about me?

25:00.433 --> 25:03.000
- It's mcconnell,
he's been saying some things.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.269
Things that are clearly untrue,
and most of us know that.

25:05.338 --> 25:07.204
- What sort of things?

25:07.339 --> 25:08.739
- Just some things
he was talking about

25:08.874 --> 25:10.474
In the squad room.
- Nazeer...

25:10.609 --> 25:12.943
What sort of things?

25:15.481 --> 25:17.348
- Accusations.

25:17.483 --> 25:19.683
Accusations...

25:19.818 --> 25:21.952
That are sexual in nature.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.353
(laughing)

25:23.389 --> 25:24.955
- Sexual?

25:25.090 --> 25:27.625
Sexual? Sexual how?

25:27.627 --> 25:29.360
- Harassment.

25:29.495 --> 25:32.963
Like, that you
propositioned him,

25:33.032 --> 25:35.833
And that he's paying the price
for turning you down?

25:35.835 --> 25:39.102
Look, the guy's talking about
filing another formal complaint.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.506
Boss, I can talk to him.
- No, no.

25:42.508 --> 25:45.742
I'm a big girl. I can
take care of this myself.

25:47.813 --> 25:49.380
(sighing)

25:53.319 --> 25:55.285
Mcconnell. Board room. Now.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.888
- Yeah, uh, I shouldn't
be alone with you.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.059
- Oh why, you think
I'm gonna proposition you?

26:02.128 --> 26:03.727
Buddy, I am a lesbian.

26:03.796 --> 26:06.930
No, look,
I am a married lesbian.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.999
But even if I wasn't,

26:09.068 --> 26:11.401
I wouldn't touch your lying,
bullying ass

26:11.437 --> 26:13.470
With a ten foot pole.

26:13.539 --> 26:15.139
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.007
There's no reason
to be so aggressive.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.610
(edwina laughs)
- oh, my god,

26:19.612 --> 26:21.979
You are disgusting.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.279
Oh!

26:23.316 --> 26:25.482
You're the kind of man
that gives cops a bad name.

26:25.484 --> 26:27.884
You give all men a bad name.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.420
You want aggressive?

26:29.555 --> 26:32.222
I will make
your life miserable.

26:32.224 --> 26:35.492
You open that lying mouth
of yours one more time,

26:35.494 --> 26:38.495
And I'll make sure
you swallow your teeth.

26:38.564 --> 26:39.696
You hear me?

26:39.765 --> 26:41.564
Oh, wait.

26:42.701 --> 26:46.469
I dunno, was that
aggressive enough for you?

26:47.573 --> 26:48.972
Asshole.

26:49.041 --> 26:51.175
- I'm gonna be in and out
of here in 10 minutes.

26:51.177 --> 26:53.110
<i> (sam): Make it seven.</i>
- Don't micromanage me,

26:53.112 --> 26:54.445
Wazowski.
<i> - Okay, it's fine,</i>

26:54.447 --> 26:56.380
But what if something happens
and I'm the only one that can...

26:56.449 --> 26:57.848
<i> - Stop!</i>
- No, okay.

26:57.917 --> 27:00.217
- My advice?
She doesn't blink first

27:00.352 --> 27:02.786
So if you want
to make up, on you.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.723
- Well, you and me,
we're different.

27:07.726 --> 27:09.459
She tells me everything.

27:09.528 --> 27:11.094
I'm her best friend.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.366
- So was I.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.803
(knocking on door)

27:23.676 --> 27:25.342
- Hey, adam, right?

27:25.477 --> 27:27.678
Look, I'm really sorry
to bother you, but marc...

27:27.813 --> 27:29.613
- It's okay,
I got len's message. It's okay.

27:29.748 --> 27:31.081
- Really okay?
- Come right in.

27:31.216 --> 27:33.250
- Thank you so much.
I really hate to call you

27:33.252 --> 27:35.285
Last minute, but I didn't know
what else to do. You know,

27:35.354 --> 27:37.488
Marc is in deep
with these real assholes.

27:37.623 --> 27:39.623
Him and len, they went after
this poker night or something

27:39.625 --> 27:41.558
<i> The other night, I don't know.</i>
(static)

27:41.627 --> 27:45.029
- Len. The connection is bad.
It's bad.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.497
- Maybe it's the area.
Wifi's down, remember?

27:48.267 --> 27:49.900
- Um, why didn't he call me?

27:49.969 --> 27:52.235
- Because they're holding marc
until they get the money.

27:52.271 --> 27:55.105
Len doesn't want to leave,
he's freaking out.

27:57.476 --> 27:58.509
- And how deep is he?

28:00.446 --> 28:01.645
- 14k.

28:01.780 --> 28:03.113
- For a card game?

28:03.248 --> 28:05.249
- And for the record,
I hate it, okay?

28:05.384 --> 28:07.517
I mean, it's one thing...

28:08.921 --> 28:10.120
...To do real business.

28:10.255 --> 28:12.756
It's a whole other thing
when you waste that
hard-earned cash

28:12.792 --> 28:14.591
On a poker game?

28:14.660 --> 28:16.526
<i> I keep trying to help him.</i>

28:17.463 --> 28:19.863
<i> (adam): You can't save people.</i>

28:19.998 --> 28:22.499
They gotta save themselves.

28:22.501 --> 28:24.234
- Yeah, yeah, but...

28:25.271 --> 28:27.404
We gotta stick by
the ones you love, right?

28:29.442 --> 28:31.475
<i> (adam): Let's go get</i>
<i> marc's money.</i>

28:31.477 --> 28:32.809
- Len.

28:33.612 --> 28:35.512
I think he lied to niccolo.

28:35.581 --> 28:37.281
I think the money's on site!

28:37.416 --> 28:38.749
- I promise, thank you so much!

28:38.818 --> 28:41.285
<i> - It's in my safe,</i>
<i> downstairs in the basement.</i>

28:41.420 --> 28:42.686
- I can't hear.

28:42.688 --> 28:45.288
I don't like this.
I don't like this.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.424
If I can't hear her,

28:47.559 --> 28:48.959
How do I know
if she's in trouble?

28:48.961 --> 28:51.028
(stammering)
this is what we want, okay?

28:51.030 --> 28:52.629
She gets to see
where he's hiding the cash.

28:52.698 --> 28:53.963
Give her a beat.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.365
You're not gonna
help your situation

28:55.434 --> 28:56.633
By getting in her face now.

28:56.702 --> 28:58.234
- You're right.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.036
(ominous music)

29:00.106 --> 29:02.038
You're right. Okay.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.640
I mean, she's a nicholson, so...

29:04.710 --> 29:06.510
She's got this.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.347
- Wow. This is some man cave.

29:16.088 --> 29:20.723
- You almost had me
with that sad boyfriend story...

29:20.760 --> 29:22.526
Officer.

29:22.595 --> 29:25.929
Marc would have told me
if he had a new poker game.

29:26.064 --> 29:28.898
- You don't want
to shoot me with that.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.034
- Oh, I don't want to
but I will if I have to.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.803
Because I have friends
who will cover for me.

29:33.839 --> 29:36.540
- Who? Niccolo? Marc?

29:37.543 --> 29:39.943
Those aren't your friends, adam.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.679
You're just a bank
for those guys.

29:43.349 --> 29:44.882
(chuckling)

29:45.017 --> 29:47.250
- Get your back against
that wall, please.

29:47.853 --> 29:49.119
- Alright.

29:50.222 --> 29:51.788
You're not really
gonna shoot that.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.629
- They don't care
if you wear a badge.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.899
You're an obstacle,
you get removed.

30:06.572 --> 30:08.438
- Yeah, it's been ten minutes
so... Alright.

30:08.507 --> 30:09.706
- Duff?

30:09.842 --> 30:12.176
Duff, you gotta give us a sign.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.912
- Hey, niccolo.
It's your bro, adam.

30:15.981 --> 30:18.182
Gimme a call back at your
earliest possible convenience

30:18.317 --> 30:20.717
Please, I have something that...

30:20.719 --> 30:22.518
I need your assistance with.

30:22.555 --> 30:26.389
- Where's your bro
when you need him, huh?

30:26.425 --> 30:28.425
See, I know guys like niccolo.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.393
Stay with them long enough,
they'll have you second-guessing

30:30.462 --> 30:32.128
Your own middle name
if you let them.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.797
I bet he says he'll come
over for game night, huh?

30:34.834 --> 30:36.733
But then it never happens.

30:36.802 --> 30:38.335
- Just because someone hurt you,

30:38.337 --> 30:39.736
Doesn't mean
everyone's a scumbag.

30:40.739 --> 30:42.706
(barking)

30:44.042 --> 30:45.775
(grunting)

30:49.181 --> 30:50.781
- Gtpd! Stop!

30:53.151 --> 30:55.118
- Hands in the air!

30:55.154 --> 30:57.020
(dog barking)

31:09.802 --> 31:10.967
(knocking on door)

31:12.238 --> 31:14.371
- Mcconnell filed
another grievance?

31:14.373 --> 31:15.505
- Yeah.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.109
- Well, can we please get
the knuckle-rapping over with?

31:19.111 --> 31:22.178
Because I've got a lot
on my plate, as you can see.

31:31.757 --> 31:34.725
- I'm sending you on secondment
while we look into this.

31:38.764 --> 31:40.463
- Come again?

31:40.499 --> 31:42.298
- 68 division.

31:44.270 --> 31:47.036
- Supervising uniforms?
Halfway across the city?

31:48.674 --> 31:51.674
Every inspector on staff
has said much worse

31:51.710 --> 31:53.143
With much less cause.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.678
- They insisted. It's just
while we look into things.

31:55.714 --> 31:57.680
- You said this wouldn't
go up the ladder.

31:57.716 --> 31:59.616
- We can't risk him
going to the press.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.419
We've got dozens of open
complaints against management

32:02.488 --> 32:05.789
This year alone.
I told you to let me handle it.

32:05.858 --> 32:07.857
- Ron, you know me.

32:07.893 --> 32:10.293
You, especially,
know what I've been through.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.429
Twenty years of this crap,
not once,

32:12.564 --> 32:14.230
Not once have I slipped.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.099
- It's not personal.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.968
We have to look
into every complaint.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.436
It won't be long.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.305
Michaels will hold it
down here for you--

32:21.440 --> 32:23.506
- Michaels? Michaels?

32:23.542 --> 32:25.242
You're gonna take everything
that I've built here

32:25.377 --> 32:27.377
And put it in the hands
of some mediocre white man?

32:27.446 --> 32:29.646
If it was anyone else,

32:29.781 --> 32:31.548
Would a grievance
have even been filed?

32:31.683 --> 32:33.983
I mean, haven't I earned
just one chance

32:34.019 --> 32:35.585
To act like a human being?

32:38.190 --> 32:39.656
- I'm sorry.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.326
(soft music)

32:49.868 --> 32:50.933
- Alright, what's gonna happen

32:50.970 --> 32:53.203
When we bring
your back end in here, huh?

32:53.205 --> 32:56.740
And your boys find out you led
us straight to the cartel?

32:56.809 --> 32:58.941
- We're halfway through
your files and transfers,

32:58.978 --> 33:01.077
We're already there.

33:04.016 --> 33:06.516
- They will kill me.
<i> (kelly): Who will?</i>

33:06.552 --> 33:08.218
<i> The sons of jupiter?</i>

33:08.287 --> 33:09.486
<i> Pandilla quince?</i>

33:09.621 --> 33:10.954
<i> The mafia?</i>

33:11.089 --> 33:13.389
- All of them. The coyotes.

33:14.259 --> 33:15.492
They're everywhere.

33:16.829 --> 33:18.294
<i> - The coyotes?</i>

33:19.531 --> 33:21.230
Were they behind the cop
shooting in marshall court?

33:21.266 --> 33:23.700
Was it a retaliation? What?

33:25.337 --> 33:26.770
Listen.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.173
There's an innocent boy in jail
right now because of this,

33:30.242 --> 33:33.410
So if you know something,
adam...

33:33.412 --> 33:34.878
Talk.

33:39.985 --> 33:41.852
- You want details?
I can give you details.

33:41.987 --> 33:45.122
But I want protection.
I want witness protection.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.357
I want a new identity,
the whole shebang.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.524
(len): You'll get that
when you talk.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.927
- No, no, my lawyer
will negotiate that.

33:50.929 --> 33:52.796
I can call her, right?

33:52.865 --> 33:56.332
And you can't send me to jail,

33:56.368 --> 33:57.934
'cause they'll
find me there too.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.807
Alright, yeah, someone'll bring
you to a safe house tonight.

34:04.843 --> 34:07.978
Sit on you, but tomorrow's
a brand new day

34:07.980 --> 34:09.679
And we're back to business.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.017
(door buzzing)

34:18.490 --> 34:20.624
Hey, um...

34:20.759 --> 34:22.225
Wait...

34:23.662 --> 34:25.428
Where are you going?

34:25.431 --> 34:27.230
- I'm not sure. Maybe maui?

34:27.232 --> 34:29.066
I've got twenty weeks
of vacation saved up,

34:29.201 --> 34:31.501
And I'm going to take all of it.

34:31.537 --> 34:33.170
- What? Wait!

34:34.273 --> 34:35.505
Why?

34:35.640 --> 34:39.242
- Ask michaels, because
he's your new unit commander.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.578
- Okay, don't joke, ed,
what are you talking about?

34:41.647 --> 34:46.183
- Kelly, just don't
let your guard down, okay?

34:46.185 --> 34:48.384
Because these people, they...

34:49.555 --> 34:52.021
They're just waiting
for you to make a mistake.

34:58.397 --> 35:00.130
(soft music)

35:00.132 --> 35:01.697
(sighing)

35:13.145 --> 35:14.477
- Hey, duff.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.215
Can I just talk to you
for a second, please?

35:19.184 --> 35:21.351
- No, 'cause I'm not
in the mood.

35:23.188 --> 35:25.822
- Uh, okay, maybe, uh...

35:25.957 --> 35:27.624
I shouldn't have...

35:27.759 --> 35:29.926
Called your sister,
but I just wanted you to know

35:29.995 --> 35:31.862
That I didn't ask her to come,
that's not what I did.

35:31.997 --> 35:34.297
She insisted. That was kind
of like... That was her idea.

35:34.432 --> 35:37.100
Honestly, duff, come on,
what did you expect me to do?

35:37.102 --> 35:39.035
'cause friends,
and that's what we are,

35:39.037 --> 35:40.770
We look out for one another.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.305
- No.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.507
Friends respect boundaries.

35:44.576 --> 35:47.911
And I told you a hundred times
I can take care of myself.

35:47.913 --> 35:50.513
- Yeah, but you also told me
that you were over him.

35:50.582 --> 35:54.250
Listen, sometimes in life,
people need back-up.

35:54.286 --> 35:56.653
Look, you went in there
on your own today,

35:56.722 --> 35:58.588
And what happened?
Really, what happened?

35:58.657 --> 36:02.058
You almost got yourself killed.
- Yeah, and I handled it!

36:02.060 --> 36:03.459
Like I always do,

36:03.529 --> 36:04.994
Without you breathing
down my neck!

36:05.030 --> 36:06.196
- Okay.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.930
I know what you think I am.

36:08.733 --> 36:09.999
I get it.

36:10.735 --> 36:12.001
It's like...

36:13.272 --> 36:15.672
It's like a loser
running around,

36:15.807 --> 36:18.642
Begging for your friendship
- stop doing that!

36:18.644 --> 36:21.945
And go home and handle
your own problems for once!

36:23.782 --> 36:25.348
- Fine.

36:26.484 --> 36:29.151
Fine, I'm gonna stop,
I'm gonna go home.

36:29.188 --> 36:31.154
'cause at least I got
a family to go home to,

36:31.223 --> 36:33.189
A family I actually like.

36:35.227 --> 36:36.426
- Yeah...

36:37.829 --> 36:41.397
No wonder you need a vision
board to connect with people.

36:42.167 --> 36:44.234
Because that right there...

36:45.437 --> 36:48.037
That is why no one
will want to be your friend.

37:08.526 --> 37:10.393
U still live here!

37:10.528 --> 37:11.728
- Hey!

37:11.797 --> 37:13.196
- You ever get the ac to work?

37:13.265 --> 37:16.333
- Eh, maybe twice
since you moved out.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.335
(both laugh)

37:18.470 --> 37:20.870
- You know, I could look at it.
- No. Thank you.

37:22.474 --> 37:25.942
But... I'm glad we did this.

37:27.212 --> 37:30.280
I needed it. I'm so pissed
off at sam right now.

37:30.282 --> 37:32.215
- She's just
looking out for you.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.417
You should let her some time.

37:37.356 --> 37:41.223
- Oh no, I'm not doing that.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.959
No!

37:44.096 --> 37:46.096
- Getting too old, got it.
No, got it.

37:46.098 --> 37:47.964
- Get your ass--
- got it, got it!

37:48.099 --> 37:50.166
(laughing)

37:51.903 --> 37:54.170
- God! Come on!
- What took you so long?

37:54.172 --> 37:55.705
- Cheater!

37:55.840 --> 37:58.541
- Maybe.
- I hate you.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.310
- You should.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.245
- Oh.
- But you don't.

38:02.247 --> 38:04.213
- You gonna start telling
me how I feel now?

38:04.283 --> 38:06.849
- Mm-mm. Done with that.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.718
Promise.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.653
I know my boundaries.

38:10.656 --> 38:13.790
I don't do rage,
and I don't do jealous,

38:13.792 --> 38:15.424
And I don't do drugs.

38:16.795 --> 38:20.129
Those three things were pretty
locked together for me, yeah?

38:21.800 --> 38:23.133
- Yeah.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.269
- I'm sorry I scared you.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.472
And I'm sorry I hurt you.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.277
But I am not sorry
for who I am now.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.079
I'm ready.

38:39.551 --> 38:40.750
- For what?

38:42.321 --> 38:44.254
- Life.

38:44.256 --> 38:45.688
Kids.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.289
House.

38:48.593 --> 38:50.493
Love, I guess?

38:51.229 --> 38:52.661
- Hmm.

38:55.634 --> 38:58.501
Anyway...
(chuckling)

38:58.537 --> 39:00.737
Have a good night, kelly.

39:11.717 --> 39:12.982
- Don't.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.188
- Don't what?

39:20.458 --> 39:21.891
- Don't go.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.263
♪ figures ♪

39:28.066 --> 39:30.065

(woman speaking on television)

39:35.974 --> 39:40.409
- It's unnerving to see
such a handsome young man

39:40.445 --> 39:42.545
Spending Friday night
with his grandmother

39:42.614 --> 39:44.480
Watching murder mysteries.

39:44.616 --> 39:47.683
- Yep, well, just getting
some quality time in.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.786
You're the one who's always
saying you're gonna die soon.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.955
- Not tonight, god willing.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.556
- Well, you never know.

39:53.691 --> 39:55.458
I could have put
poison in that tea.

39:55.494 --> 39:58.361
Get you back for tricking me
into talking to jackie.

39:58.363 --> 40:01.297
- She feels terrible,
I did her a favour.

40:01.333 --> 40:03.365
Plus, you were good together.

40:04.302 --> 40:06.035
- Elliot, what are you
doing here?

40:06.104 --> 40:08.771
- Oh, just getting some time
in with me before I die.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.773
- Oh, that is a wonderful idea.

40:10.776 --> 40:12.642
Don't move, nobody move,
I got it, I got this.

40:12.777 --> 40:16.379
Stay where you are.
Stay where you are. And...

40:17.715 --> 40:20.850
There. Honey, take a napkin.
Take a napkin.

40:20.886 --> 40:22.785
Hey mom, some to get yours.

40:22.788 --> 40:25.321
- Hey, I got into university.
- You did?

40:25.357 --> 40:26.755
- Oh.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.859
Well...

40:29.895 --> 40:31.794
You know what,
you're going to have to...

40:31.863 --> 40:33.530
- Is this gluten free?
- ...Get a good job,

40:33.665 --> 40:36.432
Because uh,
university's expensive.

40:37.469 --> 40:39.034
(scoffing)
- that's funny. You're paying.

40:40.472 --> 40:41.471
- Nope.

40:42.741 --> 40:46.475
No, not unless
I see you've changed.

40:46.511 --> 40:49.245
- Aw, come on.

40:50.415 --> 40:53.349
Friday night,
agatha christie,

40:53.351 --> 40:55.552
You two?
(laughing)

40:55.554 --> 40:58.354
If that's not changing,
I don't know what is.

40:58.490 --> 40:59.822
- Shh.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.761
(whispering): Just,
I'm so sorry,

41:05.763 --> 41:07.430
Do you guys think I have
a problem with boundaries?

41:07.499 --> 41:09.031
- What are boundaries?
- Yes.

41:10.168 --> 41:11.701
- You have the...

41:12.838 --> 41:14.504
(vacuum buzzing)
it's getting all over your...

41:14.639 --> 41:16.573
- Okay!
- I'm just saying you have to...

41:16.575 --> 41:18.707
- What is going on right now?
Stop!

41:19.644 --> 41:20.643
- Okay.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.982
- I cannot believe
this is my Friday night.

41:25.984 --> 41:28.384
- You're the one who said you
wanted to stay out of trouble.

41:28.420 --> 41:30.653
- Yeah, I know and for what?

41:30.722 --> 41:32.855
I am trouble.

41:32.858 --> 41:34.591
- Good.

41:34.593 --> 41:36.592
I've got something in the works.

41:37.295 --> 41:38.728
- What?

41:41.933 --> 41:43.332
- Snack time!

41:43.401 --> 41:44.600
- What is that?

41:44.669 --> 41:46.669
- Popcorn? Grabbers eat last.

41:46.804 --> 41:49.238
♪ to you ♪

41:49.274 --> 41:51.407
♪ you ♪

41:51.409 --> 41:52.675
♪ ooh ♪

41:52.810 --> 41:54.443
- I'll tell you later.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.379

41:58.283 --> 42:00.016
(sighing)

42:00.085 --> 42:03.286
(phone vibrating)

42:04.356 --> 42:05.955
- Who keeps calling you
this late, huh?

42:06.090 --> 42:07.624
(sighing)

42:07.626 --> 42:09.359
You got another man
I should know about?

42:09.494 --> 42:11.294
(chuckling)
- dozens,

42:11.363 --> 42:13.963
But don't concern yourself
with who's in the race.

42:14.098 --> 42:15.565
Just try to win it.

42:15.567 --> 42:17.366
(chuckling)

42:18.403 --> 42:20.002
It's three o'clock.

42:23.308 --> 42:25.241
What?

42:25.310 --> 42:26.976
(suspenseful music)

42:28.113 --> 42:29.245
(sighing)

42:29.380 --> 42:30.846
Yeah, send me the address.

42:32.017 --> 42:35.718
- I checked for a tail,
I took the side road.

42:35.853 --> 42:38.220
B-but the bike,

42:38.256 --> 42:40.322
It just came out of nowhere.

42:40.358 --> 42:42.592
- Okay, and you didn't tell
anyone you were moving him?

42:42.594 --> 42:44.660
- Nobody.
I don't know what happened.

42:44.796 --> 42:46.395
(len): Adam must've
tipped someone off.

42:46.431 --> 42:47.930
- Did he call his lawyer?

42:47.999 --> 42:49.532
- Yes, he did.

42:49.667 --> 42:51.133
But I didn't get his name.

42:51.169 --> 42:53.169
- Well, adam said
his lawyer was a woman.

42:53.238 --> 42:55.805
- Whoever he was talking to,
I'm pretty sure it was a guy,

42:55.874 --> 42:57.740
He kept calling him "brother".

43:05.317 --> 43:07.216
(ominous music)
