00:01.620 --> 00:04.275
[narrator] Previously on,
90 Day Fiance: The Other Way.

00:04.379 --> 00:08.413
We actually,
went to some orphanages here,

00:09.310 --> 00:10.413
Adopting a baby?

00:16.206 --> 00:17.275
I think it's crazy.

00:26.724 --> 00:28.551
The truth is
if it was up to me

00:28.655 --> 00:30.517
and the circumstances
were different,

00:30.620 --> 00:33.000
I would have preferred
to not rush into a marriage.

00:38.931 --> 00:40.275
Like I was really hoping,
that you would be

00:40.379 --> 00:43.965
open to using
your grandma's pastor.

00:44.068 --> 00:46.034
I don't want to get married
through religion,

00:46.137 --> 00:48.448
if our marriage
is going to end up
on divorce, Corey.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.137
I feel like,
I need to let Evelin
call the shots here

00:52.241 --> 00:54.448
because I feel like,
I am just super lucky

00:54.551 --> 00:57.620
that she's even agreeing
to go through
with the wedding.

01:01.379 --> 01:03.172
I actually asked him,
was there somebody else?

01:03.275 --> 01:04.931
Was there another
relationship?

01:05.034 --> 01:06.448
[Ariela] I guess
that's my question.

01:06.551 --> 01:10.275
Do you feel that his answers
gave you hope that
things can be fixed?

01:12.103 --> 01:13.413
Yes.

01:13.517 --> 01:15.862
[Ariela] Although, I'm not
sure what I think.

01:15.965 --> 01:18.241
I do feel good,
knowing that my mom

01:18.344 --> 01:20.793
came away
from talking with Bini
with a positive feeling.

01:25.655 --> 01:26.689
Oh yeah.

01:26.793 --> 01:28.448
[Jenny] I'm excited
and happy, right now.

01:28.551 --> 01:31.586
This is the first step
to starting
our marriage process.

01:51.931 --> 01:53.068
[sighs]

01:54.482 --> 01:57.241
-To our house and to...
-Our future.

01:57.344 --> 02:01.103
[Ellie] Victor and I
had a plan,
open beach bar in Providencia.

02:01.206 --> 02:04.344
But that plan
has totally got blown up
with the hurricane.

02:04.448 --> 02:08.034
You just focus on tourists.
You think money is everything,
money is not everything.

02:09.103 --> 02:10.448
Oh lord.

02:10.551 --> 02:13.689
Okay, if it's not everything
I'll stopped giving you money.

02:13.793 --> 02:16.275
You know,
I'm just gonna take a break.

02:16.379 --> 02:18.000
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

02:45.448 --> 02:47.172
[Steven] We're gonna need
the passports.

02:47.275 --> 02:49.793
Do you see
the birth certificates
in there?

02:49.896 --> 02:53.586
Yes, I see
my birth certificate
and yours.

02:54.068 --> 02:57.034
And the,

02:57.137 --> 03:00.068
affidavit for eligibility
of marriage, is that in there?

03:00.172 --> 03:01.103
-Yes.
-From the...

03:02.103 --> 03:04.206
-Foreign Ministry.
-Ministry.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.896
-Huh-uh.
-Very good.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.034
I know Alina is really nervous
that we're not going
to be able to get married

03:09.137 --> 03:12.551
before our tourist visas
expire in three weeks.

03:12.655 --> 03:14.413
So today, we're going
to the marriage office

03:14.517 --> 03:18.206
to turn in all the paperwork
and finally, pick a date
to get married.

03:18.310 --> 03:20.206
All right, well, let's go
and the taxi
is probably waiting.

03:20.310 --> 03:22.172
Oh-ho.

03:22.275 --> 03:23.862
[Alina] Going
to the marriage office

03:23.965 --> 03:27.310
to finally,
make an appointment

03:27.413 --> 03:28.586
to get married.

03:29.275 --> 03:30.827
It's such a relief.

03:33.241 --> 03:36.586
But, I'm still upset
that it took him so long

03:36.689 --> 03:39.517
because our visa will run out,

03:39.620 --> 03:41.310
and I will have to go
to Russia

03:41.413 --> 03:44.827
and Steven will have to go
back to America,
and long distance,

03:44.931 --> 03:47.758
that's not good
for our relationship.

03:47.862 --> 03:51.827
Because he might start
communicating with other

03:52.655 --> 03:53.896
girls again.

03:56.413 --> 03:58.034
[Steven] Does my hair look
okay, today?

03:58.137 --> 03:59.965
[Alina] Your hair
looks perfect.

04:00.068 --> 04:00.965
Okay.

04:02.206 --> 04:03.137
[Steven gasps]

04:06.862 --> 04:10.034
[Steven] I just like a huge
step of faith to be married.

04:10.448 --> 04:11.620
And I think,

04:11.724 --> 04:13.551
it's actually,
something really
beautiful about that,

04:13.655 --> 04:17.241
because we love each other
so much that even though
it's happening so fast,

04:17.344 --> 04:19.620
-we're still doing it,
which is kind of stupid.
-Yeah.

04:19.724 --> 04:21.551
But that's kinda
what love is all about,

04:21.655 --> 04:24.206
is being, dumb sometimes.

04:26.344 --> 04:27.482
-Yeah.
-So,

04:28.896 --> 04:29.724
[Alina] But,

04:30.413 --> 04:32.034
I was ready

04:32.137 --> 04:33.310
earlier than you

04:35.551 --> 04:37.965
and I wouldn't mind to

04:38.965 --> 04:41.137
start a little bit earlier,

04:42.034 --> 04:43.827
but that's okay.

04:43.931 --> 04:47.034
-Yeah, I kind of pushed it
to the last minute.
-Yeah.

04:49.689 --> 04:50.517
[Alina sighs]

04:52.206 --> 04:54.000
Yes, I'm very nervous.

05:00.862 --> 05:05.551
[Alina] If we will not be
able to get married
just as soon as possible.

05:07.068 --> 05:09.448
[speaking in Russian]

05:12.586 --> 05:15.793
I really want to go home
to Russia.

05:19.275 --> 05:20.068
Hello.

05:22.586 --> 05:24.896
Thank you. Can we sit down?

05:25.275 --> 05:26.172
Awesome!

05:27.206 --> 05:31.068
Welcome here.
Are your documents ready
already?

05:31.862 --> 05:32.689
Yeah.

05:34.379 --> 05:35.655
Can you show them, please?

05:35.758 --> 05:37.413
Yeah, let me grab those
for you.

05:38.689 --> 05:40.862
[Steven humming]

05:41.896 --> 05:42.724
Okay.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.206
[sighs]

05:52.965 --> 05:54.172
Your passports please.

06:21.275 --> 06:22.758
[woman]
And where is your affidavit?

06:26.103 --> 06:28.620
Affidavit is probably in...

06:30.103 --> 06:31.172
right here.

06:32.689 --> 06:35.275
-Oh, okay.
-[chuckles nervously]

06:40.827 --> 06:42.896
Please check
your information here.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.206
All right.

06:44.310 --> 06:46.620
-I think,
everything is correct.
-Yeah, that looks good.

06:53.931 --> 06:55.931
All your documents are okay.

06:56.034 --> 06:58.379
So we can start
your wedding procedure.

06:58.482 --> 07:00.137
[both ecstatic]

07:01.758 --> 07:03.896
[Steven] Wow, that's awesome.
Thank you so much.

07:06.965 --> 07:09.413
What do you think about
your wedding date?

07:09.517 --> 07:12.482
Um, when would be
the soonest possible?

07:21.137 --> 07:24.172
-On Wednesday at 5 'O' clock.
-[Steven] Yeah, we can do.

07:27.344 --> 07:30.000
Yeah, we just have to plan
the wedding in two days?

07:31.379 --> 07:33.103
Wow.

07:33.206 --> 07:36.241
Two days from now.
That's not a lot of time
to plan a wedding.

07:37.586 --> 07:42.413
And, I think if I were looking
at my life from the side,

07:42.517 --> 07:43.931
I'd probably be asking like,

07:45.448 --> 07:47.103
what is this kid doing?

07:47.206 --> 07:48.413
Like this is so fast.

07:51.551 --> 07:54.448
-Don't mess it up, babe.
-Okay.

07:54.551 --> 07:56.448
[Steven] I'm definitely
freaking out inside

07:56.551 --> 07:58.172
that Alina isn't baptized yet,

07:58.275 --> 08:00.275
and we still have
a lot of issues
that we are working on

08:00.379 --> 08:02.758
and we still have
a lot of expectations,
that could be different.

08:06.931 --> 08:10.000
He can understand
from the eyes,
you love each other.

08:10.103 --> 08:11.724
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

08:11.827 --> 08:15.000
But it seems like
the time that,

08:15.103 --> 08:17.586
the universe is telling us
to get married,
so we're gonna get married.

08:23.000 --> 08:23.827
Wow!

08:51.931 --> 08:54.344
[Ariela] Bini and I
have been together
in Kenya, for two months.

08:54.448 --> 08:56.551
Trying to improve
our relationship.

08:56.655 --> 08:57.758
[Biniyam] Are you happy?

08:57.862 --> 09:00.034
[Ariela] Of course, I'm happy
for Avi's birthday.

09:00.137 --> 09:01.758
My mom went home
a few weeks ago

09:01.862 --> 09:03.344
and it's been hard
without her.

09:03.448 --> 09:06.344
But, she encouraged me
to be more open to giving him
another chance.

09:06.896 --> 09:07.965
I think, you know,

09:08.068 --> 09:09.482
being his,

09:09.586 --> 09:14.103
his, abandonment issues
that he has, you know,
he probably thought,

09:14.206 --> 09:15.551
well she's gone now.

09:15.655 --> 09:18.000
Took my baby and she's gone.
I'll never see her
and him again.

09:19.034 --> 09:20.965
So, I think he went
out of control.

09:22.379 --> 09:25.310
But the way he's acting
right now,
seems that he's really,

09:25.413 --> 09:28.482
interested in having
his own family together.

09:28.586 --> 09:30.310
I mean, obviously,
things are not easy.

09:30.413 --> 09:33.310
There's a lot of like
other issues
that we have to deal with,

09:33.413 --> 09:35.034
but he's a great guy.

09:37.517 --> 09:39.034
[Biniyam] Oh yeah.

09:39.137 --> 09:41.000
Okay. So we're gonna ride
together with Avi.

09:42.068 --> 09:42.896
Okay.

09:44.034 --> 09:45.655
[speaking foreign language]

10:04.689 --> 10:05.517
Oh!

10:08.448 --> 10:09.965
[Biniyam] Yay!

10:10.068 --> 10:10.965
[Ariela] Oh my god!

10:11.068 --> 10:11.896
-Come on.
-[Avi mumbling]

10:13.655 --> 10:15.034
-[Ariela] Your not scared Avi?
-[Biniyam] Yay!

10:15.137 --> 10:16.448
-That's good.
-[Avi excited]

10:29.689 --> 10:33.620
I admit I was a little scared
when we got on here for Avi,

10:33.724 --> 10:36.448
but he's loving it.

10:36.551 --> 10:41.379
Bini loves Avi so much
and seeing how happy Avi is,
when he's with his dad

10:41.482 --> 10:44.241
and when he's with
the three of us
and we're happy together,

10:44.344 --> 10:47.965
makes me realize,
how important it is to try
and make things work.

10:52.620 --> 10:53.965
Think you learned a lot.

10:55.310 --> 10:56.206
Oh, what did I learn?

10:58.896 --> 11:00.689
Oh, I learned patience, huh?

11:01.689 --> 11:03.034
The point is, baby,

11:03.137 --> 11:04.620
that, you know, I'm happy.

11:04.724 --> 11:06.448
I wanted to come here
so that we could just

11:06.551 --> 11:07.793
spend time together
as a family.

11:07.896 --> 11:09.172
We could fix ourselves.

11:09.931 --> 11:11.344
When I went to the US,

11:11.448 --> 11:14.206
I felt like your behavior
just changed out of nowhere

11:14.310 --> 11:16.448
and you are acting
like a different person.

11:17.137 --> 11:18.448
And it was just really,

11:19.551 --> 11:20.586
shocking for me.

11:38.275 --> 11:40.827
I love you too.

11:40.931 --> 11:46.000
Bini has told me he's sorry
about the way he treated me
in New Jersey.

11:46.103 --> 11:48.551
Bini is telling me sorry
every day,

11:48.655 --> 11:51.482
but forgiveness is a process.

11:51.586 --> 11:54.965
Some days are great,
Some days are like, oh,
you know?

11:55.068 --> 11:58.448
Even though things are not
100% between Bini and I,

11:58.551 --> 12:00.620
I do really want to keep
my family together.

12:00.724 --> 12:03.275
So, I'm not willing
to give up yet.

12:05.482 --> 12:07.241
Just because I...

12:07.344 --> 12:09.758
stay now, even though
we had this horrible problem

12:09.862 --> 12:12.482
doesn't mean in the future,
that if you did
the same thing again,

12:12.586 --> 12:13.620
I would be okay with it,

12:14.206 --> 12:15.689
all right?

12:15.793 --> 12:18.103
I know, that if I went back
to Ethiopia,

12:18.206 --> 12:20.241
our relationship right now,
would be over.

12:22.206 --> 12:26.517
I came here to Kenya,
to be in a beautiful place
with my family

12:26.620 --> 12:28.655
without all the noise
from other people.

12:30.482 --> 12:32.862
I came back to Africa,
because I promised Bini

12:32.965 --> 12:34.689
I wouldn't keep him from Avi.

12:34.793 --> 12:38.103
But I don't think
it's sustainable to live
in Kenya, long term.

12:38.206 --> 12:40.344
We have to keep renewing
our visas all the time

12:40.448 --> 12:41.655
and we don't have stable work.

12:43.034 --> 12:46.172
So, since I don't want to go
back to Ethiopia,

12:46.275 --> 12:49.137
it seems to me that the US
is the best option.

12:49.241 --> 12:52.965
But I'm scared to tell Bini,
because I know,
this is gonna make him upset.

12:54.931 --> 12:56.137
My feeling is like

12:57.689 --> 12:59.793
I'd like us to try
to go to the US.

13:02.517 --> 13:05.379
Of course,
this is not forever.
So, yes, I understand.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.655
If you'd like to do that,

13:07.758 --> 13:10.655
then I think we could have
a really successful marriage
and a happy life together.

13:12.448 --> 13:15.758
It's been over a year,
since I applied for a K-1 visa
for Bini.

13:15.862 --> 13:20.206
And I still have no idea
what's going on
with the K-1 processing.

13:20.310 --> 13:23.137
When I first applied,
I wasn't even really gonna
go through with it.

13:23.241 --> 13:25.344
I was so happy with
living in Ethiopia. But,

13:25.448 --> 13:28.275
now I don't want to return
to Ethiopia.

13:28.379 --> 13:31.689
Everyone has been seeing
Bini's behavior,
he's not trying to hide it.

13:31.793 --> 13:35.344
So, it still hurts my pride
to think that other people

13:35.448 --> 13:37.931
are looking and laughing
at me basically.

13:41.689 --> 13:44.482
But, I will not ever live
in Ethiopia again.

13:49.172 --> 13:51.137
[speaking foreign language]

14:10.517 --> 14:12.068
You need to understand

14:12.172 --> 14:13.655
more about me

14:13.758 --> 14:17.000
and that means
that you need to know
where I come from

14:17.103 --> 14:19.620
and what my life was like
before I met you.

14:29.103 --> 14:29.965
I love you, babe.

14:32.758 --> 14:34.689
[Ari] Bini and I have had
a lot of challenges

14:34.793 --> 14:37.344
but we really
do love each other, so...

14:37.448 --> 14:39.620
I'm really hoping
this K-1 visa
will come through.

14:40.896 --> 14:42.448
[Bini] I really,
I love you so much.

15:04.724 --> 15:05.586
You love me?

15:05.689 --> 15:06.793
I love you, big jerk.

15:07.965 --> 15:09.448
I love you.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.655
[Ellie] I never even said,
I wanted it back.

15:23.862 --> 15:25.862
Where did this take
such a wrong term?

15:29.034 --> 15:31.137
We did just submit
our marriage application.

15:31.241 --> 15:35.000
So, we're going to be able
to marry in about 30 days.

15:35.103 --> 15:37.689
Actually, there's something
I need to tell you.

16:09.758 --> 16:13.758
[Ellie] Victor and I just got
in a huge argument
about money.

16:13.862 --> 16:20.206
We were just sitting here,
cheers'ing to like rebuilding
our house.

16:20.310 --> 16:22.310
Where did this take
such a wrong turn?

16:29.172 --> 16:34.275
I was just asking,
normal adult conversation
questions.

16:56.827 --> 16:58.379
[Ellie] That's what
you're worried about.

17:01.068 --> 17:02.586
You have a complex about it.

17:12.275 --> 17:13.448
You have a complex.

17:26.482 --> 17:29.206
I was worried, how we're gonna
actually live.

17:29.310 --> 17:30.379
That's a normal...

17:35.655 --> 17:36.448
That's a realistic...
That's a realistic...

17:42.482 --> 17:44.448
You don't even know anything
about this island.

17:44.551 --> 17:47.517
You think tourists
have been coming here forever?

17:47.620 --> 17:49.827
Tourists just start to come
here 10 years ago.

17:49.931 --> 17:51.586
What we do before 10 years?

17:52.586 --> 17:54.000
We survive.

17:54.103 --> 17:56.482
You get so defensive.

17:56.586 --> 18:00.172
You just worried about money
and money, money, money,
money, you know.

18:00.275 --> 18:02.586
Money is not all,
remember that.

18:07.310 --> 18:09.172
Whatever you're [bleep] crazy.

18:20.344 --> 18:21.413
I never even said,

18:22.206 --> 18:23.000
I wanted it back.

18:27.275 --> 18:30.517
I want to go outside actually.

18:37.793 --> 18:39.068
Psycho.

18:42.103 --> 18:44.482
[Ellie] If he has
these feelings about this,

18:44.586 --> 18:46.103
he could have,

18:46.206 --> 18:50.448
sat down with me rationally
and talked about it
not just attacked me,

18:51.172 --> 18:53.000
attacked my character.

18:55.275 --> 18:56.931
Basically,

18:57.034 --> 19:01.034
you know, basically thinks
I'm a piece of [bleep],
you know,

19:01.137 --> 19:06.896
which is really hard to take,
when all you've done is like
support that person.

19:14.896 --> 19:16.310
[Victor speaking]

19:31.827 --> 19:32.758
You know?

19:44.068 --> 19:46.310
[Ellie] I just would like
to leave.

19:47.620 --> 19:51.586
Like I want to
magically not be here anymore.

19:57.206 --> 19:58.413
[Ellie] That's crazy.

19:58.517 --> 20:02.275
It's, I don't even know
how I ended up
in this situation.

20:02.379 --> 20:03.586
I feel dumb.

20:03.689 --> 20:06.034
I feel like an idiot,
right now.

20:08.655 --> 20:11.448
Like was I that desperate?

20:11.551 --> 20:14.000
No, I thought,
I was like in love.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.724
[Victor] I feel like
it's over.

20:20.689 --> 20:23.551
I can't keep on going
with this, you know.

20:34.241 --> 20:37.689
I like, I just like, man,
I can't [bleep] --

20:38.586 --> 20:41.172
My heart can't take this

20:42.241 --> 20:43.482
anymore.

20:50.275 --> 20:52.689
So, how'd everything go
with your kids last night?

20:52.793 --> 20:55.620
[Kenny] I really don't want to
upset Armando
before the wedding,

20:55.724 --> 20:56.931
but I think he needs to know.

20:57.896 --> 20:59.379
Taylor did not like it.

21:02.620 --> 21:05.310
Brother! Hey, how's it going?

21:05.413 --> 21:07.586
Evelin and I
are getting married
in two weeks

21:07.689 --> 21:11.034
and not one person has agreed
to come on my side.

21:11.137 --> 21:15.862
I'm just calling to find out
if if you're able to
make it to the wedding or not?

21:15.965 --> 21:19.344
I do support your wedding,

21:19.448 --> 21:21.827
but I do have
reservations about it.

21:45.344 --> 21:48.034
[speaking Spanish]

21:54.413 --> 21:55.241
Come on girl.

21:56.517 --> 21:57.379
Great job.

21:59.206 --> 22:00.586
All right.

22:00.689 --> 22:05.172
The wedding's tomorrow
and I'm feeling
a lot of emotions.

22:05.275 --> 22:08.241
Just having all my family here
and Armando's family here,

22:08.344 --> 22:13.310
I hope it all goes well.
Um, I hope there's no drama.

22:13.413 --> 22:15.551
I feel like,
I'm forgetting something but,

22:15.655 --> 22:19.034
But I'm trying to keep
a smile on my face

22:19.137 --> 22:21.482
and enjoy every moment of it.

22:22.068 --> 22:23.689
[Armando] Got our shirts,

22:23.793 --> 22:26.551
our ties, our tuxes,
our pants.

22:26.655 --> 22:28.689
The basics, we got 'em.

22:28.793 --> 22:30.275
I think, we're good there.

22:31.586 --> 22:34.241
So, how'd everything go
with your kids last night?

22:34.344 --> 22:39.034
Well, I was meaning
to say some stuff to you
about it.

22:39.137 --> 22:43.206
I did talk about adoption,
how we went
to an orphanage and,

22:43.310 --> 22:44.689
Oh, you told them.

22:44.793 --> 22:47.586
You know, things got emotional
here and there.

22:47.689 --> 22:50.551
Last night I sat down
with my children
and talk to them about

22:50.655 --> 22:53.551
Armando and I
possibly expanding our family.

22:53.655 --> 22:55.517
I really don't want to upset
Armando

22:55.620 --> 22:57.413
or give him any more
to think about

22:57.517 --> 22:59.724
before the wedding,
but I think he needs to know.

23:00.793 --> 23:02.482
Taylor did not like it.

23:04.689 --> 23:06.965
She didn't like, like
adoption as a whole,

23:07.068 --> 23:10.413
like even if it was someone
half of age or like a baby?

23:10.517 --> 23:16.103
I just think, she just thinks
that I'm gonna start
a whole new family

23:17.206 --> 23:20.655
and forget about them
because I have a new family.

23:20.758 --> 23:23.448
Did you tell him that
I wouldn't want to have,
your baby?

23:23.551 --> 23:25.103
I didn't go that far.

23:25.206 --> 23:29.413
It got really tense, Armando.
Taylor was like crying.

23:29.517 --> 23:30.689
She cried a lot.

23:33.034 --> 23:36.103
Kenny's kids have always been
supportive of our relationship

23:36.206 --> 23:39.206
and they've always been
understanding.

23:39.310 --> 23:42.931
So, it's kind of sad to hear
that Taylor didn't like

23:43.034 --> 23:44.482
hearing that Kenny and I
want to adopt.

23:45.586 --> 23:48.172
It just makes me wonder
what Kenny is thinking.

23:49.724 --> 23:51.517
How are you feeling about it?

23:53.206 --> 23:55.137
I think as a whole
like they might not admit it,

23:55.241 --> 23:57.482
but they feel like
I took you away.

23:57.586 --> 23:58.965
You know, it's reality.

23:59.068 --> 24:02.034
I think they're past that,
I really do.

24:02.137 --> 24:04.379
[Armando] But it's reality
that, you know,

24:04.965 --> 24:06.793
you left because of me.

24:06.896 --> 24:10.551
So, I mean,
I see we're obviously,

24:10.655 --> 24:13.344
having a baby, that kind of,
makes it more like,

24:13.448 --> 24:15.241
you're just focused on me

24:15.724 --> 24:17.275
and us,

24:17.379 --> 24:19.551
and I can see
why that's hard for them.

24:19.655 --> 24:22.689
I definitely am fearful
that Kenny's kids
resent me.

24:22.793 --> 24:26.068
We have a good relationship
and they've expressed that,

24:26.172 --> 24:29.103
you know, they're so happy
for their dad being with me.

24:29.206 --> 24:31.965
But at the end of the day,
it's their dad,

24:32.068 --> 24:35.034
he's gone in another country
because this dude, you know,
and so,

24:36.034 --> 24:37.413
is there maybe you really

24:38.241 --> 24:39.896
how their feelings deep inside

24:40.724 --> 24:43.000
of Armando just came and

24:43.103 --> 24:45.000
ruined our family,
it took our dad away.

24:47.896 --> 24:52.206
I can see their struggle.
Again, I put myself
in their position.

24:52.310 --> 24:55.448
It's a lot for my kids
to take in.

24:55.551 --> 24:58.655
And I have to respect
their feelings and all that.

24:58.758 --> 25:02.793
And I told her, I said,
I will think about things
that you say.

25:02.896 --> 25:07.517
But as a whole, are you like
in the same spot you were
before you talked to them or

25:07.620 --> 25:09.448
were you kind of,
are you now kind of like...

25:11.034 --> 25:11.862
are we not...

25:13.827 --> 25:16.275
We're not gonna think about
any of that pressure

25:16.862 --> 25:18.275
for this weekend now.

25:18.379 --> 25:20.413
-We need to just...
-I don't know.

25:21.965 --> 25:24.896
I don't want to worry him
at all, but the truth be told,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.103
this is something,
I'm gonna have to wrestle with
and figure out.

25:31.275 --> 25:33.241
Navigating this
is not gonna be easy,

25:33.344 --> 25:35.758
but right now,
I just want to focus
on our wedding

25:35.862 --> 25:38.862
and we'll deal with all this
later on.

25:38.965 --> 25:42.344
I'm gonna enjoy myself
and I do really want
to make it about you and I

25:42.448 --> 25:44.758
and just think about us,
you and our love

25:44.862 --> 25:46.172
and I'm also,
of course, excited

25:46.275 --> 25:49.068
having my whole family
here to celebrate us.

25:49.172 --> 25:53.379
[Armando] But like, I will
admit though, I'm a little
nervous about tomorrow,

25:53.482 --> 25:56.758
our wedding is happening
and we're gonna be showing
lots of love.

25:56.862 --> 26:00.689
I think mostly knowing
you know the struggle
that my dad has had,

26:00.793 --> 26:05.586
how do you think
he'll react to us kissing
and us dancing together?

26:07.206 --> 26:08.793
A few weeks ago,
I got a text message

26:08.896 --> 26:11.137
from my aunt Brenda
about a conversation
my dad had,

26:11.241 --> 26:13.724
where she was saying,
my dad asked that
I be respectful.

26:16.034 --> 26:20.448
What my dad means
by being respectable,
is not showing affection

26:20.551 --> 26:22.827
in public,
in front of everybody
or anybody.

26:25.344 --> 26:27.275
It's one of those things that

26:27.379 --> 26:29.137
they know about,
but they don't want to see it.

26:30.862 --> 26:32.689
Because I think that's part of

26:32.793 --> 26:34.310
"the respect"
he was talking about,

26:34.413 --> 26:36.586
you know, to not be doing
those things in front of them.

26:36.689 --> 26:39.827
Well, don't get yourself
worked up over anything,
but...

26:41.275 --> 26:43.000
he's gonna see it all
tomorrow.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.448
Let's save it for tomorrow.

26:49.551 --> 26:53.448
Just be natural.
Just be you.

26:53.551 --> 26:57.344
This is supposed to be
the happiest day of our lives,
it's supposed to be our day,

26:57.448 --> 27:00.758
and I don't want him to be
afraid to show affection,

27:00.862 --> 27:04.310
to show his love for me
and for us
in front of his dad.

27:07.931 --> 27:13.241
Any one of my brothers says,
hey, I really want you here
for whatever, for a wedding.

27:13.344 --> 27:16.000
It doesn't matter,
where in the world it was.
I would be there.

27:16.103 --> 27:17.620
We were best friends
growing up

27:17.724 --> 27:20.000
and now we're not.

27:21.275 --> 27:23.379
A big reason for that was

27:24.172 --> 27:25.827
relationship with everyone.

27:49.724 --> 27:52.068
Brother! Hey, how's it going?

27:52.827 --> 27:54.172
Going good.

27:54.275 --> 27:55.931
[Corey] Evelin and I
are getting married
in two weeks,

27:56.034 --> 27:58.655
and there's a bunch of people

27:58.758 --> 28:00.241
coming on Evelin's side,

28:00.344 --> 28:03.206
and not one person has agreed
to come on my side.

28:04.413 --> 28:05.482
How's work?

28:05.586 --> 28:07.517
Long hours, but,

28:07.620 --> 28:08.793
getting used to it.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.724
Get into the swing of things.

28:10.827 --> 28:13.551
[Corey] Makes you really sad
and it makes me wonder why

28:13.655 --> 28:15.172
I don't have

28:15.275 --> 28:16.827
that sense of support.

28:16.931 --> 28:20.379
[Corey] If it's important
enough to you, you're gonna
make it happen.

28:20.482 --> 28:25.413
I'm just calling to find out
if you're able to
make it to the wedding or not.

28:25.517 --> 28:28.034
I know, before we had spoken,
you were kind of

28:29.103 --> 28:30.206
you weren't sure.

28:32.310 --> 28:35.620
Unfortunately, no,
I don't, I don't,
I won't be able to make it.

28:37.344 --> 28:40.241
And, I am sad about that.

28:40.344 --> 28:44.000
With Covid, it's just not
a good time
for really anybody.

28:44.103 --> 28:46.241
I know, we want to be there
to support you,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.344
-but,
-Yeah. No, I just --

28:49.448 --> 28:52.000
It is sad.
Yeah, the whole situation,

28:52.103 --> 28:54.344
it's a real big bummer for me

28:54.448 --> 28:58.206
you know, mom was saying like,
yeah, I'd be there if

28:58.310 --> 29:02.724
you know, if dad was around,
I know that we both would
have come and stuff like that.

29:02.827 --> 29:05.655
She's somebody that doesn't,

29:05.758 --> 29:07.931
she doesn't like traveling,
she's scared of traveling.

29:08.034 --> 29:09.620
I don't like, blame her.

29:09.724 --> 29:12.275
But, I truly do believe
though that

29:14.068 --> 29:18.482
if somebody wants
something badly enough,

29:18.586 --> 29:20.413
if it's important enough
to them,

29:20.517 --> 29:21.620
they'll make it happen.

29:23.068 --> 29:24.379
Any one of my brothers says,

29:24.482 --> 29:27.965
"Hey, I really want you here,"
for whatever, for a wedding

29:28.068 --> 29:29.793
for just to visit,
for anything,

29:29.896 --> 29:31.241
if it's very important
to them,

29:31.344 --> 29:34.448
it doesn't matter,
where in the world it was,
I would be there

29:34.551 --> 29:35.862
and that's honestly
how I feel.

29:35.965 --> 29:38.413
But I don't feel that sense

29:38.517 --> 29:40.068
of support in return

29:40.172 --> 29:41.896
and it's difficult for me
to deal with.

29:42.000 --> 29:42.827
I don't know.

29:44.689 --> 29:46.206
[Matt] Well,

29:46.310 --> 29:49.068
how many people
would it have taken
to show up

29:49.172 --> 29:51.448
that you would have felt
supported?

29:51.551 --> 29:54.310
Obviously, I would like
all of my family to be here.

29:55.241 --> 29:57.137
But,

29:57.241 --> 29:59.896
it would make
a big difference if just
one person had come.

30:01.172 --> 30:02.034
You know?

30:04.310 --> 30:06.655
You know, my relationship
with everybody.

30:06.758 --> 30:12.068
I feel like has deteriorated,
and I don't like feeling
the sense of separation.

30:12.172 --> 30:14.965
Just upsetting that
nobody's like come to visit.

30:15.068 --> 30:19.655
I get married one time
and I'm the only one here,

30:19.758 --> 30:23.000
it's just it gets to me,
you know what I mean?

30:23.103 --> 30:28.137
We obviously are family
and we love you, but the past

30:28.241 --> 30:31.310
three or four years
you've been down in Ecuador

30:31.413 --> 30:34.620
and um,
yeah we have grown apart.

30:37.827 --> 30:40.655
Um, it's not to say that
we don't support you but...

30:49.517 --> 30:51.310
When Evelin was living
in the US

30:51.413 --> 30:56.172
with my family,
it was really sad actually,
and it was really hard.

30:57.206 --> 30:58.655
Evelin didn't feel welcome.

30:58.758 --> 31:01.275
She basically kept herself
locked up in the apartment

31:01.379 --> 31:03.482
and she would come down
to eat dinners and what not

31:03.586 --> 31:07.448
but didn't really speak
with my family too much.

31:07.551 --> 31:09.689
-Evelin, how you doing?
-Good.

31:09.793 --> 31:11.034
Haven't seen you much today.

31:11.137 --> 31:12.931
It's too cold to get out.

31:13.034 --> 31:14.689
[Corey] Too cold!

31:14.793 --> 31:18.310
I never thought,
we'll live in a place
that isolated.

31:18.413 --> 31:20.172
That feel really trapped.

31:27.413 --> 31:28.206
Yeah, I know.

31:30.275 --> 31:31.931
So she gave me an ultimatum,

31:32.034 --> 31:34.931
come live with me in Ecuador
or we're done.

31:36.275 --> 31:37.827
[Matt] We were best friends
growing up

31:37.931 --> 31:41.103
and now we're not.

31:41.206 --> 31:44.931
And I think a big reason
for that was

31:46.275 --> 31:47.448
relationship with Evelin.

31:48.724 --> 31:51.965
The last time that I saw you
is when Evelin was here

31:52.068 --> 31:53.689
and we were not
on great terms.

31:55.103 --> 31:58.413
And she demanded that you go
live in Ecuador with her.

31:58.517 --> 32:02.034
She didn't want to live
in the United States because
she hated the United States.

32:02.137 --> 32:04.586
And you obliged,
and went down there

32:04.689 --> 32:07.517
because you wanted to save
the relationship,
and I get that. I do.

32:07.620 --> 32:11.344
But I mean,
we haven't seen you now
and that's just,

32:11.448 --> 32:13.793
it sucks, that she demanded
that of you.

32:15.793 --> 32:20.068
Seems like,
Evelin just makes decisions
based upon what she wants

32:20.172 --> 32:22.241
and doesn't really
think that --

32:22.344 --> 32:24.689
She doesn't take
your opinions into
consideration.

32:26.793 --> 32:30.413
I'm in love with Evelin.
I've spent,

32:30.517 --> 32:33.862
there's a reason I have spent
seven years with her
is because

32:33.965 --> 32:38.655
she is the person I love
and I'm making a big sacrifice

32:39.620 --> 32:40.620
because I love her.

32:42.172 --> 32:44.931
You do have to make
sacrifices for the people
you love.

32:45.586 --> 32:47.275
But,

32:47.379 --> 32:49.931
I just wish,
that you had to make less,
that's all I'm saying.

32:52.034 --> 32:53.655
Ultimately. I do

32:54.379 --> 32:56.206
support your wedding,

32:56.310 --> 32:58.862
but I do have reservations
about it, Corey,

32:58.965 --> 33:04.034
because of all of the past
disagreements we had.

33:04.137 --> 33:08.068
She's keeping you away
from the United States
and our family.

33:10.275 --> 33:11.827
[Corey] I knew
there was problems.

33:11.931 --> 33:14.137
I knew they didn't really
accept her that much.

33:14.241 --> 33:17.586
But this is the first time
that I'm actually hearing

33:18.862 --> 33:21.344
this for my brother
at least to this extent.

33:21.689 --> 33:22.827
But...

33:24.068 --> 33:25.448
then again,
it's my wedding.

33:25.551 --> 33:27.413
That shouldn't be a reason
for them not to come.

33:29.586 --> 33:33.448
You know, if they don't agree
with Evelin, that's fine.

33:33.551 --> 33:36.000
But they should still
be there for me.

33:36.103 --> 33:39.689
I mean, we're sorry
that we can't make it.
Honestly, we are.

33:40.482 --> 33:41.827
Yeah.

33:41.931 --> 33:47.862
I wish you the best,
and it's your wedding,
so enjoy it.

33:48.413 --> 33:49.724
You know?

33:50.517 --> 33:51.482
All right.

33:52.724 --> 33:53.827
Bye.

33:58.103 --> 33:59.103
You don't want to marry me?

33:59.206 --> 34:02.379
Absolutely 100%.
You do not want to marry me.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.724
[Jenny] This is stupid.
I'm not doing this anymore.

34:30.931 --> 34:31.896
[Jenny] Hi, baby.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
[Sumit] Hi, baby.

34:34.344 --> 34:36.000
-[Jenny] Hi.
-[Sumit] Hi.

34:41.655 --> 34:43.241
-[Jenny] Cheers.
-Cheers.

34:44.413 --> 34:46.172
-[Sumit] Good morning, to you.
-Good morning.

34:49.344 --> 34:51.172
-Very good.
-[Sumit] Thank you.

34:52.551 --> 34:55.310
So did you know that today,
like I have to

34:56.034 --> 34:57.344
go to my parents' house?

34:58.275 --> 34:59.068
Yeah, I know.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.448
[Sumit speaking]

35:16.965 --> 35:18.724
So it's just family only,

35:19.965 --> 35:22.482
not outsiders,
people who are not family.

35:31.379 --> 35:36.344
I asked my parents
if Jenny can come this time,
but they said not now,

35:36.448 --> 35:38.206
maybe some time later.

35:38.310 --> 35:41.965
I feel like still very hard
for them to accept Jenny

35:42.068 --> 35:44.379
as my future wife.

35:44.482 --> 35:48.275
But I hope they will
fully accept Jenny
in future sometimes.

35:49.758 --> 35:52.068
I mean, I'm happy.
I'm not hated by them anymore.

35:52.172 --> 35:54.206
Yeah, I know
that's gonna take time
for them.

35:54.310 --> 35:56.413
But when we do get married,

35:56.517 --> 35:58.310
then I think
we need to explain to them

35:58.413 --> 36:01.655
and start thinking about
including Jenny in functions.

36:02.137 --> 36:03.655
Mmm.

36:03.758 --> 36:06.241
We did just submit
our marriage application.

36:06.344 --> 36:09.137
So, your parents
need to hurry up
and get over it

36:09.241 --> 36:12.206
because we're gonna be
able to marry
in about 30 days.

36:17.379 --> 36:19.724
[Sumit] Actually,
there's something
I need to tell you.

36:26.482 --> 36:27.310
Uh.

36:28.482 --> 36:29.965
You know what?

36:33.965 --> 36:37.655
After filing
that marriage application,

36:37.758 --> 36:40.724
you know,
I was a bit nervous about it

36:40.827 --> 36:43.689
as he was saying that
he's going to file it
on the same day...

36:53.517 --> 36:57.206
Without me even knowing
you just call the lawyer
and told him to stop it.

36:57.310 --> 36:58.965
I mean why would you do that?

37:02.448 --> 37:03.379
I was nervous.

37:06.206 --> 37:08.689
We finally get
the green light to get married

37:08.793 --> 37:12.034
and then bam!
I'm blindsided by,
I don't, I'm scared.

37:15.586 --> 37:18.862
I'm hurt
that he didn't tell me
and I'm angry that he did it.

37:26.241 --> 37:28.517
-You've never been
in a real marriage.
-[Sumit] Yeah.

37:28.620 --> 37:30.206
Your other marriage
was not a real marriage.

37:30.310 --> 37:31.413
It doesn't even count.

37:43.103 --> 37:45.482
I can understand
if you're boyfriend
and girlfriend

37:45.586 --> 37:48.448
and that's all you are
and you never live together.

37:48.551 --> 37:51.103
You always live separately.
But that's not us.

37:51.206 --> 37:54.034
What you're thinking about
is not us.

37:54.137 --> 37:56.068
We are completely different
from that.

37:58.827 --> 38:00.724
He's known me
for such a long time.

38:00.827 --> 38:02.758
I'm the one he confides in.

38:02.862 --> 38:04.862
I'm the one he can trust.

38:04.965 --> 38:06.379
I'm the one that he loves.

38:06.482 --> 38:07.862
Why would I change?

38:07.965 --> 38:11.206
If anything, I would become
a lot more happy person

38:11.310 --> 38:14.586
and feel a lot more confident
if he would marry me.

38:16.655 --> 38:19.482
It's madness. I don't know
why he thinks that?

38:30.586 --> 38:32.068
How about supporting me?

38:32.172 --> 38:34.137
I stood by you
through everything.

38:34.241 --> 38:38.000
I've been by your side,
through everything,
I put up with everything.

38:38.103 --> 38:40.275
I have been through
hell and back, man.

38:40.379 --> 38:43.103
Especially you know,
learning that you were already
married and everything.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.034
How should I feel

38:45.137 --> 38:47.586
of everything that I've done
for you and given up for you,

38:47.689 --> 38:50.172
and you're still not sure
if you want to marry me
or not?

38:51.896 --> 38:54.344
Okay, I'm not gonna keep
giving you all the time in
the world.

38:54.448 --> 38:58.275
It's not fair
to keep me hanging
by a thin thread here.

38:58.379 --> 39:01.000
You have a green light,
we can get married.

39:01.103 --> 39:02.586
But at this point,

39:02.689 --> 39:05.103
if you're still saying
we're not going to get married

39:05.206 --> 39:08.931
or I'm still scared
or I need more time,
than I know for sure...

39:10.275 --> 39:11.896
that you don't want to
marry me.

39:13.793 --> 39:16.655
And I shouldn't be here then,
really, I shouldn't be here.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.068
I guess I'll be going back
to America now.

39:45.034 --> 39:46.586
Yeah, I guess I will be.

39:46.689 --> 39:47.655
Don't do that.

39:49.172 --> 39:51.965
-What am I supposed to do?
-Calm down.

39:52.068 --> 39:54.034
Calm down? I've been calm.
I think I've been

39:54.137 --> 39:55.931
-pretty damn calm.
-You need to be
calm down more.

39:56.034 --> 39:58.448
Been more calm,
than I should be.

39:58.551 --> 40:02.551
Either you want to marry me
and be with me
for the rest of your life

40:03.241 --> 40:04.034
or you don't.

40:05.517 --> 40:07.827
I do.

40:07.931 --> 40:10.896
Okay, so you're gonna call
the lawyer and tell him
to resume the process?

40:13.586 --> 40:15.344
I will, give me--

40:15.448 --> 40:16.586
I will, when?

40:19.931 --> 40:20.931
You don't want to marry me.

40:21.034 --> 40:24.172
Absolutely 100%
you do not want to marry me.

40:31.034 --> 40:32.689
What do you mean?
What does that mean?

40:37.758 --> 40:40.137
This is stupid.
I'm not doing this anymore.

40:44.241 --> 40:45.862
[bleep] embarrassing me.

40:51.275 --> 40:52.793
-Why are you embarrassing
the [bleep] me?
-Not at all!

40:52.896 --> 40:54.310
-What is wrong with you?
-No! I'm not.

40:54.413 --> 40:57.586
Don't you know how stupid
you look sitting there
saying nothing.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.586
I'm telling you
don't say anything. Calm down.

40:59.689 --> 41:02.034
I'm telling you.
I'm looking at you
with my eyes.

41:02.137 --> 41:03.931
You're saying just wait.
Just give me time.

41:04.034 --> 41:06.724
Just like, okay,
I'll go sit down in the house

41:06.827 --> 41:09.034
and I'll just sit there
and wait until you're ready.

41:09.137 --> 41:11.482
I'm telling, keep on telling,
yeah I will.

41:11.586 --> 41:14.586
We have already been given
this green light and still,

41:14.689 --> 41:17.379
that even still,
you're not ready to go.

41:17.482 --> 41:20.344
Nothing, I'm just
asking you to calm down.

41:20.448 --> 41:24.551
Okay, then go
do whatever you want to do.

41:25.931 --> 41:29.758
I think you basically,
are telling me
the truth right now.

41:29.862 --> 41:33.344
You don't want to marry me.
That's basically,
what you're saying.

41:33.448 --> 41:35.965
Go to your function,
go to your family.

41:39.482 --> 41:41.551
I think
I have decisions to make.

41:44.862 --> 41:47.137
[Jenny] "I'm scared. I'm afraid
you're gonna change."

41:47.931 --> 41:50.551
It's ridiculous.
It's just excuses.

41:52.137 --> 41:54.517
Still, he can't decide
if he wants to marry me
or not.

41:54.620 --> 41:56.896
Then maybe that means,
I shouldn't be here anymore.

41:58.517 --> 42:00.448
They can't just
keep letting him

42:01.241 --> 42:02.103
do this to me.

43:04.413 --> 43:07.206
-Good morning, you're awake.
-[Armando] Hey, babe. Yes.

43:07.310 --> 43:10.206
-It's wedding day!
-I know! I'm excited.

43:10.310 --> 43:12.793
-Are you excited?
-Yes, I woke up and like,

43:12.896 --> 43:15.931
last day as fiances.

43:16.034 --> 43:18.448
-God, I can't believe it.
I really can't.
-[laughs]

43:18.551 --> 43:21.310
It's amazing that
it's just come this far.

43:21.413 --> 43:23.793
And we've been waiting
for this day

43:23.896 --> 43:25.551
for a long damn time.

43:25.655 --> 43:27.586
And then we're gonna
split up today.
[laughs]

43:27.689 --> 43:29.137
[Armando] I know, but...

43:29.241 --> 43:30.965
It was good to wake up
next to you.

43:31.068 --> 43:33.586
I know, I just think
it's amazing.

43:33.689 --> 43:37.620
The best day of my life.
It truly is.

43:37.724 --> 43:40.517
I never dreamed at this age
that I would be...

43:42.310 --> 43:44.448
...actually getting married,

43:44.551 --> 43:49.379
and marrying the person
that I cannot believe
loves me for me.

43:49.482 --> 43:51.344
And I could not be happier.

43:54.827 --> 43:57.965
Uh, it's a blessing in itself
that I can be here

43:58.068 --> 44:00.827
But, um--
Like, I did wake up
this morning

44:00.931 --> 44:04.034
and I did kinda get
a little bit sick
to my stomach though,

44:04.137 --> 44:06.517
you know, just thinking of...

44:06.620 --> 44:09.551
My dad seeing us kiss
for the first time,

44:10.137 --> 44:11.551
and...

44:11.655 --> 44:15.000
Not liking it.
I don't want him
uncomfortable, and it's--

44:15.103 --> 44:18.206
Sorry to say,
but it is a little awkward

44:18.310 --> 44:19.655
to be in that position

44:19.758 --> 44:21.896
and to have to worry about it.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.034
I don't want them to be, like,
disgusted or anything
like that, like, "Ugh."

44:25.137 --> 44:28.551
Babe,
you can't think like that.

44:28.655 --> 44:31.586
I'm about to marry
the man of my dreams...

44:38.172 --> 44:41.517
They seemed very happy
last night for the most part,
that I've seen.

44:41.620 --> 44:43.034
You know, they're happy
for us, yeah,

44:43.137 --> 44:45.103
they were smiling
and they've even said before,

44:45.206 --> 44:47.206
oh, they support me,
they support us.

44:47.310 --> 44:50.724
But, he has to be respectful.
You know, those were
my dad's words.

44:50.827 --> 44:55.137
So like, does that still stand
on our wedding day,
is my concern.

44:55.241 --> 44:57.517
Does he expect us not to...

44:57.620 --> 45:01.862
So, you know, to not
disrespect him in any way,
by kissing or showing any...

45:02.931 --> 45:04.724
...affection.

45:04.827 --> 45:07.758
Well, it'd be disrespectful
for him to ask us not to.
[laughs]

45:07.862 --> 45:09.896
So... you know?

45:10.000 --> 45:12.551
He knows
what a wedding's about.
He knows it's gonna come.

45:12.655 --> 45:14.793
He's been to a wedding before.

45:14.896 --> 45:17.862
-I don't think
he thinks it, though.
-[Kenny] Well...

45:17.965 --> 45:20.620
Then he's gonna get
an eyeful. [laughs]

45:20.724 --> 45:23.034
-Eyeful?
How we gonna kiss?
-[Kenny laughs]

45:23.137 --> 45:25.551
Whatever comes natural.

45:25.655 --> 45:28.931
-We're not gonna make out
or anything like that?
-[Kenny] No! Stop!

45:30.275 --> 45:32.413
Whatever comes natural.
That's it.

45:32.517 --> 45:34.000
Don't overthink it.

45:36.517 --> 45:37.620
I know.

45:43.344 --> 45:45.275
I know you're starting
to freak yourself out.

45:45.379 --> 45:49.206
Well, not only that.
I'm worried about
our first dance too.

45:49.310 --> 45:52.310
Again, it's like,
all eyes on us.

45:53.172 --> 45:54.172
So it's...

45:55.517 --> 45:59.068
...scary, you know?
And like, how do we dance?

45:59.172 --> 46:03.103
-Cause I don't want my arms
up top like I'm a bride.
-[laughs]

46:03.206 --> 46:05.482
Just, again, natural.

46:05.586 --> 46:08.931
You can't analyze everything.

46:09.034 --> 46:12.000
[Armando] It's hard for me
to decide, like,
how we're gonna dance

46:12.103 --> 46:15.689
because, I've never had
slow danced with a man,
and I've never seen it.

46:15.793 --> 46:17.620
So I just don't know, like,
where the hands go.

46:17.724 --> 46:20.620
My nature a little bit
with Kenny is,
since he is a little shorter,

46:20.724 --> 46:23.172
is like, to put 'em on top.
But I don't want to feel
like I'm the bride.

46:23.275 --> 46:25.482
I feel like that's more
of a feminine thing.

46:25.586 --> 46:30.310
So, I'm a little lost
on what to do, like,
where do our hands go?

46:30.413 --> 46:32.620
-You're trying to analyze it.
-[Armando] Well,
I need to know

46:32.724 --> 46:34.482
where our hands-- I don't know
where to place them.

46:34.586 --> 46:36.000
Wherever you want
to put 'em.

46:37.068 --> 46:39.758
-Smack my ass. [laughs]
-[Armando] No.

46:39.862 --> 46:42.137
-No.
-[Kenny] Don't worry about it.

46:43.896 --> 46:47.206
Don't regress,
because you can't think
about that crap.

46:48.344 --> 46:49.241
You can't.

46:50.344 --> 46:53.068
It's actually like,
I know you've come out

46:53.172 --> 46:55.241
a couple times,
trying to come out and...

46:55.344 --> 46:57.413
A year-and-a-half
was your big coming out.

46:57.517 --> 46:59.655
But this is almost like
your official coming out,

46:59.758 --> 47:02.724
to all your family,
your extended family,

47:02.827 --> 47:04.413
-Yeah.
-[Kenny] Like,

47:04.517 --> 47:06.413
everyone's gonna see
the real you and I love it,

47:06.517 --> 47:09.206
and I think
it's a beautiful thing.
And...

47:09.310 --> 47:12.172
...I just want you
to embrace it. Take it all in,

47:12.275 --> 47:15.275
and just live in the moment
tonight.

47:15.586 --> 47:16.793
And...

47:18.241 --> 47:23.310
it's about us, but it's--
To me, it's really about you.

47:23.413 --> 47:24.896
Thank you, babe.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.655
I do agree
with Kenny saying this is like
another coming out for me.

47:27.758 --> 47:30.275
A lot of my extended family
I haven't seen

47:30.379 --> 47:33.551
since I came out.
So, this is like coming out
of the house to everybody.

47:33.655 --> 47:36.793
Everybody will be seeing
Kenny and I for the first time
together.

47:36.896 --> 47:38.896
So, I'm a little nervous
about that.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.310
I love you and I want it to be
about you as well.

47:42.931 --> 47:44.103
Okay?

47:45.310 --> 47:46.689
Shorter kiss than that,
though, tonight.

47:46.793 --> 47:50.448
-Oh, shut up.
-[Armando]
I'm kidding.[chuckles]

48:09.758 --> 48:12.379
-[Ariela] Hey, Bin?
-[Biniyam] Yes?

48:12.482 --> 48:15.275
-[Ariela] It's video call time
with the lawyer.
-Okay.

48:16.965 --> 48:19.310
It's been over
a month since my mom left

48:19.413 --> 48:21.965
and things have been okay
with Bini.

48:22.068 --> 48:23.827
I still feel traumatized
by the whole situation,

48:23.931 --> 48:26.620
even if I'm ready to forgive
Bini and move forward.

48:26.724 --> 48:27.896
It still stings.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.482
But I do feel
a lot more optimistic

48:31.586 --> 48:33.655
and a lot more motivated
to keep trying.

48:33.758 --> 48:38.551
Is this your good luck charm
for talking to the lawyer?

48:38.655 --> 48:41.965
It's been over a year
since I applied for
a K-1 visa for Bini.

48:42.068 --> 48:44.206
Thinking that might be
a good option for us,
just in case

48:44.310 --> 48:46.586
we decided not to live
in Ethiopia anymore.

48:46.689 --> 48:50.000
And now it seems to me that
the US is the best option.

48:51.413 --> 48:54.551
Hi, Bini. Hi, Ari.
How are you today?

48:54.655 --> 48:56.586
Good. Hi, Jessica.

48:56.689 --> 48:59.724
[Ariela] The whole time
we've been here in Kenya,
I've been checking every day

48:59.827 --> 49:01.689
to hear news
about the K-1 visa.

49:01.793 --> 49:06.689
And yesterday I got an email
saying that his process
is finally moving along.

49:06.793 --> 49:09.448
-So nice to see you.
-[Biniyam] Nice to see you,
nice to meet you.

49:09.551 --> 49:11.586
[speaking in other language]

49:26.206 --> 49:29.620
So I'm actually calling
with some fantastic news.

49:29.724 --> 49:33.620
We have received
our final packet
from the consulate.

49:33.724 --> 49:37.034
And we have
an interview date
in 19 days.

49:40.896 --> 49:43.448
Wow, that's actually
very soon.

49:43.551 --> 49:47.137
Yeah, I don't know
if we're ready for that.

49:47.241 --> 49:49.206
Maybe if Bini and I were

49:49.310 --> 49:51.103
in a happier place,

49:51.206 --> 49:53.000
I could focus more
on the excitement

49:53.103 --> 49:55.793
of all the firsts
that we're gonna have
in America.

49:55.896 --> 49:59.655
But, because of how much
he hurt me, it's hard
to be as excited

49:59.758 --> 50:01.896
as I might have been before.

50:02.000 --> 50:06.137
[Jessica] The interview takes
about 15 to about 30 minutes.

50:06.241 --> 50:09.448
I want both of you
to attend it, together.

50:09.551 --> 50:14.620
Okay, but,
I had read on online that,

50:14.724 --> 50:17.000
at least
for the embassy in Addis,

50:17.103 --> 50:21.551
they don't often let in
the American.

50:21.655 --> 50:23.517
[Jessica] So, for Bini
to say to the officer,

50:23.620 --> 50:26.206
"Hey, Ari was not allowed in,

50:26.310 --> 50:28.310
but she is waiting
for me outside."

50:28.413 --> 50:31.103
That shows support,
and that's very important.

50:31.206 --> 50:33.965
Because it's totally
different when if Bini's like,

50:34.068 --> 50:36.896
"Well, she's not here.
I don't know."

50:37.000 --> 50:40.620
You know? So, yes, I would
want both of you to be present

50:40.724 --> 50:43.172
and available
for the interview.

50:43.275 --> 50:44.655
I've been trying
not to think about the fact

50:44.758 --> 50:47.137
that one day Bini
would have to go back
to Ethiopia,

50:47.241 --> 50:49.965
and I might actually
have to go with him.

50:50.068 --> 50:51.689
But, the thought of going back
there right now,

50:51.793 --> 50:54.586
after everything
that's happened,
really upsets me so much.

50:54.689 --> 50:59.551
He's made me look stupid
in front of all my friends,
in front of his family.

50:59.655 --> 51:02.413
I just don't want to face
any of those people.

51:07.034 --> 51:10.206
[Jessica] One of the things
that I want
to touch base on

51:10.310 --> 51:12.586
is the COVID portion of this.

51:12.689 --> 51:15.793
Because in order to enter
the US consulate,

51:15.896 --> 51:19.413
you must not have any travel
for 14 days.

51:19.517 --> 51:22.000
So we're gonna have to go
to Ethiopia,

51:22.103 --> 51:24.448
and probably,
as soon as next week.

51:25.551 --> 51:29.034
Oh. my God. So, okay.
I'm freaking out now, so...

51:29.137 --> 51:32.655
-I should probably go
at the same time as him, then?
-Yes.

51:35.137 --> 51:39.206
I am in no way mentally
or physically prepared
to go back to Ethiopia.

51:39.310 --> 51:41.206
And now the lawyer's
telling me, like,

51:41.310 --> 51:46.862
"No, You have to go,
and you have to do it now!"
It's like, that's insane.

51:46.965 --> 51:49.206
It's gonna be
a crazy three weeks.

51:49.310 --> 51:52.103
-Yeah.
-[Jessica] But it's totally
gonna be worth it.

51:52.206 --> 51:55.413
Yeah. Yeah, I hope so.
I mean, I know so.

51:55.517 --> 51:58.172
Yeah. I'm just like,
it didn't register for me

51:58.275 --> 51:59.793
until like, when you say like,
three weeks?

51:59.896 --> 52:02.137
Wow, then I just,
now I'm like, really nervous.

52:03.241 --> 52:06.482
Yes. Three weeks.
But we will be ready.

52:06.586 --> 52:08.413
For the longest time
I was thinking like, "Oh,

52:08.517 --> 52:09.827
I'm gonna have to, like,
figure out

52:09.931 --> 52:12.241
how I can expedite
this visa?" And then
all of a sudden, like--

52:12.344 --> 52:14.965
Boom! It happened so much
faster than I imagined.

52:15.068 --> 52:17.793
You know? Now we're thinking,
like, three weeks and...

52:17.896 --> 52:20.310
Wow. I'm just so excited,
and I,

52:20.413 --> 52:22.310
just, I'm scared, I'm excited

52:22.413 --> 52:25.137
and I'm glad we have you
to help us.

52:25.241 --> 52:27.103
I'm sending you
really good wishes,

52:27.206 --> 52:29.172
-and we'll keep talking, okay?
-Okay, talk to you soon.

52:29.275 --> 52:31.862
-[Jessica] Bye.
-[Biniyam] Bye! [chuckles]

52:34.862 --> 52:37.827
I-- I feel like...

52:37.931 --> 52:41.689
That's not, you know,
I was like,
thinking, "Okay, just go,

52:41.793 --> 52:43.896
do it, get your paperwork
done, go by yourself."

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
And now I'm like,
I need to help you and...

52:47.103 --> 52:48.379
Yeah. If you--

52:52.034 --> 52:53.034
Hmm.

52:54.068 --> 52:57.137
Feels like things
are moving at lightning speed.

52:57.241 --> 53:00.172
I want this visa to go through
because I feel like
it's our only hope.

53:00.275 --> 53:03.068
But at the same time,
I don't know if I'm gonna
be ever ready

53:03.172 --> 53:04.896
to go back to Ethiopia.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.896
But if I don't,
it will hurt Bini's chances
of being approved.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.310
So, I'm really torn
about what to do.

53:22.655 --> 53:25.206
I don't really have
much say on this wedding.

53:25.310 --> 53:27.172
Kinda what Evelin wants,
is what Evelin gets.

53:27.275 --> 53:28.965
[Raul] I don't mean
to be rude, dude,

53:29.068 --> 53:31.000
but she's not thinking
about you,

53:31.103 --> 53:33.068
she's just thinking about her.

53:35.137 --> 53:36.344
[Jenny] I think
he likes things

53:36.448 --> 53:38.068
-the way that they are.
-Yeah. Yes.

53:38.172 --> 53:41.310
-We're not married,
but we're as a married couple.
-[Shaktimata] Yes.

53:41.413 --> 53:44.241
So he's getting all the perks,
without any responsibilities.

53:44.344 --> 53:46.379
-Yeah, that's...
-[Shaktimata] He should
be taking responsibility.

53:46.482 --> 53:49.172
He's a grown-up man.
Don't let him use you.

53:49.275 --> 53:50.931
Yeah.

54:16.000 --> 54:16.965
'Sup, buddy?

54:18.758 --> 54:21.310
Evelin and I
are getting married
in two weeks,

54:21.413 --> 54:24.448
and while I'm really excited
that this wedding
is happening,

54:24.551 --> 54:28.413
I'm just really bummed out
that I'm not gonna have
any support from my side.

54:29.931 --> 54:33.482
One person I always thought
would be at my wedding,
is Raul.

54:33.586 --> 54:36.965
But Raul and I actually
had a bit of a falling out
a few months ago.

54:37.068 --> 54:38.965
[Raul] What's been
going on, man?

54:39.068 --> 54:41.068
I haven't spoken
to you in a long time.

54:41.172 --> 54:44.793
You know, we used to be
super tight and now it's...

54:44.896 --> 54:45.896
We ain't.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.620
I know,
and I don't like that.

54:59.172 --> 55:00.724
And that hurts.

55:00.827 --> 55:02.172
Yeah, there's been a lot of...

55:03.517 --> 55:05.448
A lot of unnecessary drama,
I feel like,

55:05.551 --> 55:07.620
that happened when I went
to stay with you.

55:07.724 --> 55:09.275
[Corey] During the time
Evelin kicked me out

55:09.379 --> 55:11.586
because of the whole
Jenny situation,

55:11.689 --> 55:14.000
I stayed with Raul
for a few weeks.

55:14.103 --> 55:17.379
But I decided to move out
because it was just
causing more problems

55:17.482 --> 55:19.793
between me and Evelin
and our relationship.

55:21.793 --> 55:23.482
When you posted that,

55:23.586 --> 55:25.551
you know,
when we went out to eat

55:25.655 --> 55:28.586
and you invited
those two girls?

55:28.689 --> 55:30.137
Caused a lot of problems.

55:32.379 --> 55:36.103
When I was staying with Raul,
he invited me out
to go have dinner.

55:36.206 --> 55:41.620
And little did I know
he had invited two girls
to come join us.

55:41.724 --> 55:44.275
I didn't know who they were.
Raul invited them.

55:44.379 --> 55:48.103
They were his friends,
and they were both
already in relationships.

55:48.206 --> 55:51.827
Raul decided to take out
his phone and do
a social media story.

55:51.931 --> 55:56.482
Evelin obviously sees this,
and she gets really mad.

55:56.586 --> 55:59.586
Nothing happened.
We just had dinner,
and then we left.

55:59.689 --> 56:03.000
But it became
a much bigger problem
after that.

56:04.551 --> 56:06.482
Me and Evelin
had just separated,

56:06.586 --> 56:09.344
I'm staying with you,
she doesn't know
what we're doing.

56:09.448 --> 56:10.724
It looks bad, you know?

56:10.827 --> 56:15.310
I know that the intention
wasn't to set me up

56:15.413 --> 56:17.931
on a date with them.
That, I know that.

56:18.034 --> 56:19.793
But it...

56:19.896 --> 56:23.344
It appeared that way.
And I remember
specifically saying,

56:23.448 --> 56:25.827
"Raul, don't post that
because it looks bad.

56:25.931 --> 56:28.206
It's gonna make
Evelin really upset."

56:28.310 --> 56:29.896
It did cause
all of these problems

56:30.000 --> 56:33.482
and it could have easily
been prevented had you
just listened to me.

56:33.586 --> 56:37.379
I get everything you say,
but I never meant any harm.

56:37.482 --> 56:40.793
Maybe you didn't think
anything would come of it,
I don't know.

56:40.896 --> 56:43.931
But Evelin took it
the absolute wrong way.

56:44.034 --> 56:45.965
I was--
it's just me, dude.

56:46.068 --> 56:48.965
I post pictures of food,
pictures of girls,

56:49.068 --> 56:50.793
but sometimes it doesn't
mean anything.

56:50.896 --> 56:52.482
It's just what I'm doing
daily.

56:52.586 --> 56:54.655
And I'm not being a...

56:54.758 --> 56:56.551
I've been an ass sometimes,
to you.

56:56.655 --> 56:58.896
Dude, I want
to make it up to you.
You know?

56:59.000 --> 57:01.758
I wish nothing but the best
to you and to Evelin.

57:01.862 --> 57:03.724
-You're a really
good man, bro.
-Thanks.

57:03.827 --> 57:05.689
You're a really good person.

57:05.793 --> 57:08.241
Just sucks
that all this had to happen
at this moment.

57:08.344 --> 57:11.034
Because it did screw up
a lot of things, you know?

57:11.137 --> 57:13.827
Like, I'm so sorry.
But I have to say that

57:13.931 --> 57:15.344
you're not invited
to the wedding.

57:21.586 --> 57:22.862
Really?

57:22.965 --> 57:25.620
There's not an invite for you.

57:25.724 --> 57:27.344
So, I do apologize about that.

57:28.275 --> 57:29.586
She's like, "Corey, like,

57:29.689 --> 57:31.827
look, we can't have Raul
at the wedding."

57:33.344 --> 57:37.758
I've been Corey's friend
for a little over seven years,

57:37.862 --> 57:40.413
and I'm his only friend
in Ecuador.

57:40.517 --> 57:43.000
I've known Evelin
for more than 10 years.

57:43.103 --> 57:45.206
I've been so supportive
of both of them

57:45.310 --> 57:47.413
and I'm not invited
to the wedding.

57:47.517 --> 57:49.103
And it's just destroying me.

57:50.379 --> 57:52.896
I really-- You know,
I would like you to be there

57:53.000 --> 57:56.758
because I don't have-
I don't have anybody coming.

57:56.862 --> 57:59.344
Nobody from my family
is coming.

57:59.448 --> 58:02.586
None of my friends are coming.
Not one person.

58:03.896 --> 58:06.275
Not one person is coming.

58:06.379 --> 58:09.482
And you know what?
I don't like the fact that

58:09.586 --> 58:12.724
I'm your only friend,
and Evelin doesn't want me
to come to the wedding.

58:14.896 --> 58:19.448
I put myself
in his shoes, and...

58:19.551 --> 58:22.103
if it was my situation
and I was getting married,

58:22.206 --> 58:24.482
none of my friends,
family members,

58:24.586 --> 58:26.586
were there, I'll be--

58:26.689 --> 58:28.620
I probably wouldn't be able
to get married.

58:28.724 --> 58:32.241
I wouldn't feel
the emotional support
to do it.

58:32.344 --> 58:33.482
It's horrible.

58:33.586 --> 58:36.172
I don't really have much...

58:36.275 --> 58:38.344
Much say on this wedding.

58:38.448 --> 58:40.620
Kinda what Evelin wants
is what Evelin gets.

58:40.724 --> 58:42.344
Sort of. And...

58:42.448 --> 58:43.827
I don't mean to be rude, dude,

58:43.931 --> 58:46.275
but she's not thinking
about you,

58:46.379 --> 58:47.620
she's just thinking about her.

58:47.724 --> 58:51.103
I don't know, maybe you can
reconsider it? 'Cause...

58:51.206 --> 58:53.620
We've been friends
for a really long time and...

58:53.724 --> 58:56.793
[sighs] Right now, I just feel
like I'm on very thin ice.

58:56.896 --> 58:59.448
There are consequences
to my decisions.

58:59.551 --> 59:02.655
If I do anything wrong,

59:02.758 --> 59:05.310
like, she could
call off the wedding.

59:08.413 --> 59:11.413
I'm torn because
I'd really like to have
that support from Raul.

59:11.517 --> 59:13.689
But I know
the risks it brings.

59:13.793 --> 59:15.758
If Raul shows up
to the wedding,
that could really

59:15.862 --> 59:18.758
trigger Evelyn,
and it could be a disaster.

59:18.862 --> 59:21.034
I just feel all this pressure,
you know?

59:23.068 --> 59:24.241
What do I do?

59:26.310 --> 59:30.758
You know what?
Whether I'm invited or not,
I'm gonna be at that wedding.

59:30.862 --> 59:34.206
I feel it's the right thing
to do to show Evelin

59:34.310 --> 59:36.344
that there's people
that care about Corey.

59:36.448 --> 59:37.862
She needs to grow up,
you know?

59:37.965 --> 59:40.137
Evelin can't have
her own way in everything.

59:40.965 --> 59:42.793
That's not how life works.

59:46.344 --> 59:48.241
[speaking Russian]

1:00:18.551 --> 1:00:20.551
[speaking Russian]

1:00:22.724 --> 1:00:25.310
[Alina] Yesterday,
Steven and I got approval

1:00:25.413 --> 1:00:26.620
to get married.

1:00:26.724 --> 1:00:27.827
And now,

1:00:27.931 --> 1:00:31.517
our wedding is tomorrow,
and I'm very, very excited.

1:00:33.551 --> 1:00:35.413
[speaking other language]

1:00:41.862 --> 1:00:47.275
[Alina] While Steven is out
running errands
for our ceremony,

1:00:47.379 --> 1:00:49.896
I called a wedding planner.

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:51.793
She speaks Russian.

1:00:51.896 --> 1:00:53.379
[speaking Russian]

1:02:10.172 --> 1:02:13.827
[Alina] I was never expected
my marriage like this.

1:02:16.931 --> 1:02:21.034
But I'm still excited
that I'm gonna marry Steven

1:02:21.137 --> 1:02:22.965
and everything
is gonna be like...

1:02:23.068 --> 1:02:26.413
Really magic and special.

1:02:26.517 --> 1:02:27.724
[speaking Russian]

1:02:51.206 --> 1:02:53.517
-[Elena] Wow!
-[laughter]

1:02:54.724 --> 1:02:56.620
[speaking Russian]

1:03:34.965 --> 1:03:38.793
[Alina] It doesn't look like
a normal, white wedding dress.

1:03:38.896 --> 1:03:43.000
But, if I cared
about traditions,

1:03:43.103 --> 1:03:48.482
I wouldn't go to Turkey
and do my wedding here.

1:03:48.586 --> 1:03:51.448
I would stay in Russia
with my family

1:03:51.551 --> 1:03:54.275
and that's why I think
this dress

1:03:54.379 --> 1:03:56.379
is perfect for my wedding.

1:04:11.275 --> 1:04:13.172
[speaking Russian]

1:04:17.827 --> 1:04:20.344
Now that I have
my wedding dress,

1:04:20.448 --> 1:04:22.103
it feels so real

1:04:22.206 --> 1:04:24.827
that I'm getting married
tomorrow.

1:04:24.931 --> 1:04:28.000
But I still haven't tell
about it my mom.

1:04:28.103 --> 1:04:29.827
[speaking Russian]

1:04:35.793 --> 1:04:40.241
I'm nervous because
when my mom left Turkey,
two months ago,

1:04:40.344 --> 1:04:44.724
she had a lot
of concerns about us.
About Steven, especially.

1:04:44.827 --> 1:04:48.034
But, I hope
she will change her mind

1:04:48.137 --> 1:04:49.655
and be happy for us.

1:04:51.206 --> 1:04:53.068
[speaking Russian]

1:05:08.103 --> 1:05:09.034
[chuckles]

1:06:03.586 --> 1:06:04.724
But I'm still very excited

1:06:04.827 --> 1:06:07.965
because the most important
person is here,

1:06:08.068 --> 1:06:09.275
and it's Steven.

1:06:10.448 --> 1:06:12.586
[speaking Russian]

1:07:57.793 --> 1:07:58.758
[Ellie] Last night,

1:07:58.862 --> 1:08:02.034
Victor and I
got into this huge fight.

1:08:02.137 --> 1:08:04.034
And I don't even know

1:08:04.137 --> 1:08:08.517
if he's gonna come back
to San Andres,
or even if I want him to.

1:08:36.379 --> 1:08:40.482
Last night, Victor and I
got into, like,
this huge fight.

1:08:40.586 --> 1:08:43.034
It was-- It was definitely
like the biggest fight

1:08:43.137 --> 1:08:44.793
we've ever gotten into.

1:08:44.896 --> 1:08:48.896
It was crazy,
it went from like
zero to 60 really fast,

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:54.206
and today I'm feeling

1:08:54.310 --> 1:08:56.724
really upset about it,
and honestly,

1:08:56.827 --> 1:08:58.482
I don't even know

1:08:58.586 --> 1:09:00.758
if he's gonna come back
to San Andres,

1:09:00.862 --> 1:09:02.931
or even if I want him to.

1:09:10.137 --> 1:09:11.241
Hi, cutie.

1:09:12.034 --> 1:09:13.068
Come here.

1:09:14.448 --> 1:09:15.620
My BFF.

1:09:15.724 --> 1:09:19.034
At least somebody
in this house likes me.

1:09:19.137 --> 1:09:22.344
I feel sad leaving the island.

1:09:22.448 --> 1:09:24.448
It was just
kind of a metaphor

1:09:24.551 --> 1:09:26.482
of our relationship right now.

1:09:26.586 --> 1:09:30.103
It's just, like, destroyed
and in shambles

1:09:30.206 --> 1:09:32.103
and that's how I feel inside.

1:09:37.103 --> 1:09:39.137
[Victor] I don't know
what's happening today,
really.

1:09:39.241 --> 1:09:43.172
Maybe she just go alone,
maybe we go back together.

1:09:43.275 --> 1:09:45.517
We haven't been
communicating to each other

1:09:45.620 --> 1:09:46.931
since last night.

1:09:48.965 --> 1:09:51.862
But I would really love
to try to talk

1:09:51.965 --> 1:09:54.344
and see if we can fix this

1:09:54.448 --> 1:09:56.034
or what's gonna happen.

1:09:57.103 --> 1:09:58.275
Hello.

1:09:59.413 --> 1:10:00.827
How are you?

1:10:00.931 --> 1:10:02.758
-I'm okay, how are you?
-You're okay?

1:10:02.862 --> 1:10:04.275
I just come to offer you

1:10:04.379 --> 1:10:06.758
like if we could
go for a walk on the beach

1:10:06.862 --> 1:10:08.034
and have a talk?

1:10:08.137 --> 1:10:09.758
Yeah, for sure.

1:10:10.413 --> 1:10:11.344
[grunts]

1:10:26.413 --> 1:10:28.862
I still feel
like I love him,

1:10:30.586 --> 1:10:33.517
and part of me
wants to work on it

1:10:33.620 --> 1:10:35.275
but I don't know if there's--

1:10:35.379 --> 1:10:39.586
Like, if he's not willing
to admit

1:10:39.689 --> 1:10:42.620
or even apologize for, like,

1:10:42.724 --> 1:10:45.172
the way he treated me
last night, like--

1:10:45.275 --> 1:10:47.689
I mean, how can we, like,
move forward?

1:10:50.448 --> 1:10:53.172
Because right now I'm, like,
in defensive mode.

1:10:58.344 --> 1:10:59.241
Yeah.

1:11:00.724 --> 1:11:02.344
[Victor] I don't know if you
want we to sit here.

1:11:02.448 --> 1:11:03.758
[Ellie] Okay.

1:11:04.931 --> 1:11:06.448
[Victor] Hmm.

1:11:16.758 --> 1:11:17.965
So...

1:11:19.896 --> 1:11:22.275
I really want to,
I want this to work out

1:11:22.379 --> 1:11:26.275
and I know maybe
I overreacted last night.

1:11:26.965 --> 1:11:28.172
Um...

1:11:28.275 --> 1:11:30.344
It was not nice.

1:11:30.448 --> 1:11:33.931
Like, I woke up this morning
and I just felt

1:11:34.034 --> 1:11:36.862
kind of empty and sad.

1:11:36.965 --> 1:11:39.068
Like, I think
both of our behaviors

1:11:39.172 --> 1:11:40.793
wasn't that great.

1:11:40.896 --> 1:11:43.344
I mean, I didn't mean
to make you feel bad

1:11:43.448 --> 1:11:44.586
about the money.

1:11:45.931 --> 1:11:48.931
I just, do you think
you resent me?

1:11:49.034 --> 1:11:51.103
Like deep inside, you know,

1:11:51.206 --> 1:11:52.758
you would rather
be making the money

1:11:52.862 --> 1:11:54.241
or something like--

1:12:09.413 --> 1:12:10.827
You know?

1:12:10.931 --> 1:12:13.275
-And it's just
miscommunication, I think.
-Yeah.

1:12:13.379 --> 1:12:15.241
That's like
our problem right now.

1:12:15.344 --> 1:12:18.551
And like we've never had
that problem too much before.

1:12:20.620 --> 1:12:25.034
I just wanna work it out
and say I'm sorry
again for last night,

1:12:33.448 --> 1:12:37.000
I think we're both
emotionally tired right now

1:12:37.103 --> 1:12:38.655
and physically tired

1:12:38.758 --> 1:12:40.137
with the hurricane and like,

1:12:40.241 --> 1:12:44.068
losing everything, basically.
It's a lot.

1:12:44.172 --> 1:12:45.517
Yeah pan-- I mean you know

1:12:45.620 --> 1:12:47.689
I almost forget
there's a pandemic going on

1:12:47.793 --> 1:12:50.413
because of the hurricane,
you know?

1:12:51.896 --> 1:12:56.482
Victor's apology
seems sincere.
He seems really upset

1:12:56.586 --> 1:12:58.000
and you know,

1:12:58.103 --> 1:13:02.551
I regret talking to him
and yelling at him too.

1:13:02.655 --> 1:13:05.000
We both just need
to move on from that.

1:13:05.103 --> 1:13:08.344
We do love each other a lot
and you know,

1:13:08.448 --> 1:13:11.862
when we're strong
and everything's good, um,

1:13:11.965 --> 1:13:13.758
it's perfect.

1:13:13.862 --> 1:13:15.724
It's been hard
trying to be there for you

1:13:15.827 --> 1:13:18.551
and not always knowing
what to say,

1:13:18.655 --> 1:13:21.241
or what to do.
You know, I feel like

1:13:21.344 --> 1:13:24.931
you're definitely, like,
on edge and that makes sense.

1:13:25.793 --> 1:13:26.965
Sometimes I don't know

1:13:27.068 --> 1:13:28.689
how to react to that.

1:13:28.793 --> 1:13:30.862
You know, even though
I'm going through

1:13:30.965 --> 1:13:32.241
a hard time right now...

1:13:39.482 --> 1:13:41.655
I mean, I love you.
I know you love me.

1:13:41.758 --> 1:13:44.034
I know that we don't
wanna hurt each other.

1:13:44.137 --> 1:13:45.586
No, I mean,

1:13:45.689 --> 1:13:49.517
why should I want to hurt
the person that I love?

1:13:49.620 --> 1:13:52.931
I want to share
the rest of my life with.

1:13:54.413 --> 1:13:55.586
'Cause I'm on your side,

1:13:55.689 --> 1:13:58.310
I'm like your biggest fan,
you know?

1:13:58.413 --> 1:14:01.068
-I know.
You like my music.
-[laughs]

1:14:01.172 --> 1:14:04.000
-You like my cocktails
that I make.
-Yeah.

1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.068
[laughs] Do you think
you can cut my hair?

1:14:09.172 --> 1:14:10.724
Yeah, I can give you a style.

1:14:15.862 --> 1:14:18.551
I want to move forward.

1:14:18.655 --> 1:14:21.103
Okay, I think that's fine.

1:14:21.206 --> 1:14:23.551
I still love you.

1:14:23.655 --> 1:14:25.448
I still love you too.

1:14:34.413 --> 1:14:36.724
Wait, I have a present...

1:14:40.689 --> 1:14:42.896
And I know she still love me
and I wanna

1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:44.586
give it a go
with this relationship

1:14:44.689 --> 1:14:46.793
and I'm definitely ready to

1:14:46.896 --> 1:14:48.655
ask her to be my wife.

1:14:53.172 --> 1:14:54.000
[chuckles]

1:14:58.586 --> 1:15:00.793
Yeah. I love those shells.

1:15:33.310 --> 1:15:34.620
Will you?

1:15:39.103 --> 1:15:40.310
Will you marry me?

1:15:40.413 --> 1:15:41.689
Yes.

1:15:41.793 --> 1:15:43.379
[Victor] Okay.

1:15:46.689 --> 1:15:47.551
Thank you.

1:15:49.068 --> 1:15:51.551
[Ellie] Of course, I--
I wanted to say yes.

1:15:53.655 --> 1:15:55.586
I wouldn't want
to marry you last night.

1:15:58.689 --> 1:15:59.586
Yeah.

1:15:59.689 --> 1:16:01.551
This engagement is like

1:16:01.655 --> 1:16:04.137
a new step for us,
a new beginning.

1:16:07.206 --> 1:16:09.000
Yeah. Exactly.

1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:12.000
I don't know
if it's gonna fit.

1:16:12.103 --> 1:16:13.793
[both laugh]

1:16:16.344 --> 1:16:18.379
I'm gonna get married

1:16:18.482 --> 1:16:21.103
for the first time in my life.

1:16:21.206 --> 1:16:24.241
And it's gonna be
a nice moment.

1:16:25.275 --> 1:16:26.758
Think I'm gonna like it.

1:16:26.862 --> 1:16:28.068
Aw.

1:16:30.379 --> 1:16:33.413
[Ellie] The ultimate goal
is still to have our bar

1:16:33.517 --> 1:16:35.482
and live together, and--

1:16:40.793 --> 1:16:42.000
Just chill.

1:16:46.344 --> 1:16:48.000
[Ellie]
We have hurdles to deal with

1:16:48.103 --> 1:16:50.517
that we weren't actually
necessarily expecting

1:16:50.620 --> 1:16:51.724
but it feels good

1:16:51.827 --> 1:16:54.068
that we're
gonna do it together.

1:16:54.172 --> 1:16:55.827
It feels good.

1:17:04.034 --> 1:17:06.586
[Shaktimata] The fact that
he's stalling the process,

1:17:06.689 --> 1:17:08.310
that speaks volumes.

1:17:08.413 --> 1:17:10.103
It would speak volumes to me.

1:17:10.206 --> 1:17:12.758
He's not giving you
what you deserve, right?

1:17:12.862 --> 1:17:14.413
Just walk away.

1:17:14.517 --> 1:17:18.655
Maybe he does need
to be by himself for a while.

1:17:18.758 --> 1:17:21.931
Maybe then he'll find out
what does he really want.

1:17:43.448 --> 1:17:45.000
[Jenny] Hare Krishna.

1:17:49.379 --> 1:17:50.482
Earlier today,

1:17:50.586 --> 1:17:52.551
Sumit told me that he went
behind my back and stopped

1:17:52.655 --> 1:17:55.000
our marriage application
from being submitted.

1:17:55.103 --> 1:17:57.344
Then he left the house
to go to a family function

1:17:57.448 --> 1:17:59.275
that I'm not even invited to.

1:18:01.068 --> 1:18:04.241
I just don't even know
what's going on with Sumit,

1:18:04.344 --> 1:18:05.965
but I decided
rather than sitting around

1:18:06.068 --> 1:18:07.620
at home fuming,
I would rather go

1:18:07.724 --> 1:18:09.517
to the ISKCON temple.

1:18:09.620 --> 1:18:11.000
[quietly chanting]
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,

1:18:11.103 --> 1:18:12.551
Krishna, Krishna,
Hare Krishna...

1:18:12.655 --> 1:18:15.482
I've been back to the temple
a few times
since the first time I went,

1:18:15.586 --> 1:18:18.000
and it's always
a very calming place

1:18:18.103 --> 1:18:21.000
and I definitely
could use some calm right now.

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:25.724
Hare Krishna!

1:18:25.827 --> 1:18:28.241
Hare Krishna, Jenny.
How are you?

1:18:28.344 --> 1:18:29.758
I am good, how are you?

1:18:29.862 --> 1:18:32.241
-So nice to see you.
-I'm good, thanks.
Same here.

1:18:32.344 --> 1:18:33.827
Shall I sit with you
for a minute?

1:18:33.931 --> 1:18:36.448
-Please, would you?
-Yeah. Okay.

1:18:36.551 --> 1:18:39.137
So, how's everything?

1:18:39.241 --> 1:18:42.137
[sighs] As you can see,
I'm still here in India.

1:18:42.241 --> 1:18:45.965
Yes. Any changes
since we last talked?

1:18:46.068 --> 1:18:48.448
So many. Big changes.
Since the last time

1:18:48.551 --> 1:18:50.068
I talked to you--
Remember, I was telling you

1:18:50.172 --> 1:18:52.379
about my situation
of marriage and everything.

1:18:52.482 --> 1:18:53.620
Yes, I know.

1:18:53.724 --> 1:18:56.758
So finally, we got
his parents' approval.

1:18:56.862 --> 1:18:58.655
They're not gonna
stop us from marrying.

1:18:58.758 --> 1:19:00.827
They've been like
our biggest road block.

1:19:00.931 --> 1:19:03.379
-Mm-hm.
-So, we started
the process,

1:19:03.482 --> 1:19:05.551
-the application process.
-Mm-hm?

1:19:05.655 --> 1:19:07.068
And then it turns out that

1:19:07.172 --> 1:19:10.068
Sumit called the lawyer
and told him to stop and wait.

1:19:11.793 --> 1:19:14.206
He's not quite ready yet,
just wait.

1:19:14.310 --> 1:19:16.793
He's just says he's nervous
and he's so scared.

1:19:16.896 --> 1:19:18.827
He's-- He thinks
if he marries me

1:19:18.931 --> 1:19:21.137
it's gonna hurt
our relationship
and I'm gonna change.

1:19:22.172 --> 1:19:23.551
And what do you think?

1:19:24.931 --> 1:19:27.655
No. If anything, I'm gonna
become a lot more happier

1:19:27.758 --> 1:19:29.931
and feel
a lot more comfortable.

1:19:31.310 --> 1:19:33.241
Every month I'm so scared
and stressed out

1:19:33.344 --> 1:19:35.241
that they're not gonna give me
my visa extension

1:19:35.344 --> 1:19:37.931
and I'm gonna
have to leave India.

1:19:38.034 --> 1:19:40.206
If he would marry me,
that would end, and I--

1:19:40.310 --> 1:19:42.620
And then I would have
my peace of mind, you know?

1:19:42.724 --> 1:19:44.965
Yes, yes,

1:19:45.068 --> 1:19:46.689
and he needs to give you that.

1:19:46.793 --> 1:19:48.344
He keeps saying,
"I'll handle it.

1:19:48.448 --> 1:19:52.137
Just be calm. Don't worry,
I'm gonna handle it."

1:19:52.241 --> 1:19:53.827
His way of handling it
is not doing anything.

1:19:53.931 --> 1:19:55.344
-[laughs]
-Right?

1:19:55.448 --> 1:19:57.241
I guess so.

1:19:57.344 --> 1:20:01.000
Oh, well, if he really wanted
to be with you,

1:20:01.103 --> 1:20:03.206
he wouldn't leave any chance.

1:20:05.862 --> 1:20:09.310
And the, the fact that
he's stalling the process,

1:20:09.413 --> 1:20:11.172
that speaks volumes.

1:20:11.275 --> 1:20:12.689
It would speak volumes to me.

1:20:12.793 --> 1:20:14.586
-Yeah.
-I don't know about you.

1:20:16.068 --> 1:20:18.620
If he is not ready
to walk the mile for you,

1:20:18.724 --> 1:20:20.379
that much distance for you,

1:20:20.482 --> 1:20:22.724
then, where is the love?

1:20:26.344 --> 1:20:27.827
It is important for a man

1:20:27.931 --> 1:20:30.724
to give that status
to the woman.

1:20:30.827 --> 1:20:32.586
Because if there's
no formal relationship,

1:20:32.689 --> 1:20:34.172
then you know
in a few years' time

1:20:34.275 --> 1:20:36.586
he'll find some other woman
more attractive

1:20:36.689 --> 1:20:38.655
and he says "Okay,
we are not married.

1:20:38.758 --> 1:20:40.068
I'll go off to her."

1:20:40.172 --> 1:20:42.965
I mean, she invested
so much in him,
and then he walks off.

1:20:43.068 --> 1:20:45.172
There is no stability.
There is no commitment.

1:20:45.275 --> 1:20:46.620
What kind
of relationship is that?

1:20:46.724 --> 1:20:48.241
I think he likes things

1:20:48.344 --> 1:20:50.137
-the way that they are.
-Yeah. Yes.

1:20:50.241 --> 1:20:52.068
We're not married
but we're as a married couple.

1:20:52.172 --> 1:20:54.827
Yes, so he's
getting all the perks

1:20:54.931 --> 1:20:57.517
without any responsibilities.

1:20:57.620 --> 1:20:59.379
-Yeah, that's true.
-He should be
taking responsibility,

1:20:59.482 --> 1:21:00.724
he's a grown up man.

1:21:00.827 --> 1:21:02.517
Don't let him use you.

1:21:03.551 --> 1:21:05.965
Yeah, I agree. I know.

1:21:06.965 --> 1:21:08.758
You're right.

1:21:08.862 --> 1:21:12.275
I think we sometimes forget
what we owe to ourselves.

1:21:12.379 --> 1:21:13.620
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1:21:13.724 --> 1:21:15.448
So, I don't know.

1:21:16.517 --> 1:21:19.551
Maybe just go back.
Back to the US.

1:21:21.241 --> 1:21:24.586
Let him feel
how important you are for him.

1:21:24.689 --> 1:21:26.000
Let him miss me.

1:21:27.931 --> 1:21:30.137
I mean, I know the advice
she's given me is right.

1:21:30.241 --> 1:21:31.275
It's the correct advice,

1:21:31.379 --> 1:21:34.379
but it's not that easy for me
to just leave.

1:21:34.482 --> 1:21:36.379
Even with everything
that's happened,

1:21:36.482 --> 1:21:38.551
Sumit postponing the marriage

1:21:38.655 --> 1:21:41.862
and being afraid to marry me
and making up excuses,

1:21:41.965 --> 1:21:45.793
I still feel
more love from Sumit

1:21:45.896 --> 1:21:47.655
than I've ever felt
from anyone else.

1:21:49.068 --> 1:21:52.586
Honestly, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1:21:52.689 --> 1:21:55.551
I mean, and to think
of just leaving him,

1:21:55.655 --> 1:21:58.931
it's really hard.
I, I say I'm going to

1:21:59.034 --> 1:22:00.758
and I tell him I'm going to,

1:22:00.862 --> 1:22:03.344
but when it comes down to it,
I can't do it.

1:22:03.448 --> 1:22:04.827
And he knows that.

1:22:04.931 --> 1:22:06.655
I know. This is the problem
but I don't--

1:22:06.758 --> 1:22:08.206
That's why
there is no decision.

1:22:09.551 --> 1:22:11.689
He knows, oh,
she's just saying it.

1:22:11.793 --> 1:22:14.241
She'll stay.
She won't leave.

1:22:15.758 --> 1:22:17.000
How are you going
to convince him

1:22:17.103 --> 1:22:18.724
when you're not convinced
that you're gonna leave?

1:22:20.103 --> 1:22:22.965
She's right.
Every time I tell Sumit
that I'm gonna leave

1:22:23.068 --> 1:22:25.206
and go back to the US
and I don't do it,

1:22:25.310 --> 1:22:27.620
it's like I'm crying wolf.

1:22:27.724 --> 1:22:30.103
It's just pretty much
buying him more time I think.

1:22:30.206 --> 1:22:33.206
You have to know
that actually
you're going to leave.

1:22:33.310 --> 1:22:36.379
And the day you leave,
he will make a decision.

1:22:36.482 --> 1:22:38.000
So now I need to go, then--

1:22:38.103 --> 1:22:39.827
So you have
to take that step.

1:22:39.931 --> 1:22:42.620
It might be
very hurting to you...

1:22:42.724 --> 1:22:45.344
-Yeah, very.
-...to step away

1:22:45.448 --> 1:22:49.310
but if it makes both of you
arrive at a conclusion
in your life,

1:22:49.413 --> 1:22:51.034
then it's worth it, isn't it?

1:22:53.482 --> 1:22:56.103
He's not giving you
what you deserve, right?

1:22:56.206 --> 1:22:57.965
Just walk away.

1:22:59.482 --> 1:23:02.206
[Jenny] Maybe I really do
need to leave Sumit.

1:23:02.310 --> 1:23:04.758
I mean, I'm at a crossroads.

1:23:04.862 --> 1:23:09.172
Do I just keep giving Sumit
you know, time,

1:23:09.275 --> 1:23:12.586
or do I lose everything
and just go?

1:23:14.206 --> 1:23:16.827
If I want Sumit to know
how serious I am,

1:23:16.931 --> 1:23:18.965
then probably I should go.

1:23:20.448 --> 1:23:23.448
Maybe he does need
to be by himself for a while.

1:23:24.655 --> 1:23:26.931
Maybe then he'll find out
what does he really want.

1:23:28.551 --> 1:23:32.275
I need to be strong
and think about myself first.

1:23:34.793 --> 1:23:37.862
Even if it breaks my heart
into a million pieces.

1:23:43.448 --> 1:23:47.034
[man] Next time on
90 Day Fiance, The Other Way.

1:23:47.137 --> 1:23:48.517
How am I gonna
get through this day?

1:23:48.620 --> 1:23:50.241
[laughter]

1:23:50.344 --> 1:23:54.413
We've had a lot of obstacles
with his family,

1:23:54.517 --> 1:23:56.103
with me moving here.

1:23:56.206 --> 1:23:59.241
I can't believe this moment
has finally arrived.

1:24:03.172 --> 1:24:05.310
[Steven] Obviously,
it's hard for Alina

1:24:05.413 --> 1:24:07.482
not having her friends
and family at the wedding.

1:24:07.586 --> 1:24:08.793
Meow!

1:24:08.896 --> 1:24:11.931
So I'm gonna invite
some of the neighborhood cats.

1:24:12.034 --> 1:24:14.931
-This is for Alina, guys.
-[cat meows]

1:24:15.034 --> 1:24:18.000
[Jenny] Tomorrow,
I'm marrying Sumit

1:24:18.103 --> 1:24:19.827
and I'm feeling so excited.

1:24:19.931 --> 1:24:23.241
His parents said
they're not gonna stop us

1:24:23.344 --> 1:24:25.275
but we're choosing
not to tell them

1:24:25.379 --> 1:24:26.827
till after we're married.

1:24:31.172 --> 1:24:33.827
[Ariela] I'm not sure
if I want to go with you.

1:24:33.931 --> 1:24:35.275
Bini leaves to go back
to Ethiopia

1:24:35.379 --> 1:24:37.241
for his K-1 visa
interview tomorrow.

1:24:40.275 --> 1:24:41.586
I don't know.

1:24:41.689 --> 1:24:43.206
[Biniyam speaking
other language]

1:24:51.448 --> 1:24:54.000
Might throw up
down the aisle,
that would be the worst.

1:24:54.103 --> 1:24:55.827
I keep telling myself,

1:24:55.931 --> 1:24:59.517
"You're already married,
Evelin. Go through this."

1:24:59.620 --> 1:25:01.965
But I still am terrified.

1:25:02.068 --> 1:25:04.068
[speaking Spanish]
