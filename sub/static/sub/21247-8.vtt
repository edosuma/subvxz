00:04.438 --> 00:05.604
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:58.059 --> 01:00.159
(ROARS)

01:01.829 --> 01:04.396
(NARRATOR READING)

01:04.398 --> 01:06.298
(KION READING)

01:14.208 --> 01:15.841
Lion Guard,
keep digging!

01:17.745 --> 01:19.211
Faster!

01:19.213 --> 01:21.914
THURSTON:
Panic and run!
Panic and run!

01:21.916 --> 01:24.283
Kion!
The Zebras
are stampeding!

01:24.285 --> 01:25.551
We'll get to them.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.419
Right now we've
gotta stop this fire

01:27.421 --> 01:29.721
before it spreads
through the Pride Lands!

01:29.723 --> 01:33.725
Reposition!
Surround the flames,
but stay back!

01:33.727 --> 01:36.095
Beshte, we'll need
a new trench.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.296
You got it, Kion.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.666
(GRUNTING)

01:43.604 --> 01:45.671
Kion! The fire's
at the trench!

01:47.608 --> 01:49.108
Beshte, get out of there!

01:50.144 --> 01:52.077
(FIRE ROARS)
(GASPS)

01:52.079 --> 01:53.445
(GRUNTS)

01:56.717 --> 01:58.984
(FIRE SIZZLES OUT)

01:58.986 --> 02:01.153
Phew! That was close.

02:01.155 --> 02:03.789
(SIGHS) Good work, everyone.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.958
Ono? How bad's the damage?

02:05.960 --> 02:07.226
I'll see what I can see.

02:10.064 --> 02:14.500
Not bad, Kion. It looks like
the zebras still have
plenty of grass left to eat.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.635
The zebras! Ono!

02:19.406 --> 02:21.707
ONO:<i> Hapana.</i>
They're still stampeding!

02:24.078 --> 02:25.811
Till the Pride Lands end...

02:25.813 --> 02:27.746
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

02:30.818 --> 02:32.351
RAFIKI: Now, Makini...

02:32.353 --> 02:35.254
One of the Royal Mjuzi's
duties is to paint...

02:35.256 --> 02:37.523
The history
of the Pride Lands!
I know!

02:37.525 --> 02:39.358
And I really want to do
a good job!

02:39.360 --> 02:41.460
But I've never painted
anything before.

02:41.462 --> 02:42.861
I'm not sure how...

02:42.863 --> 02:45.364
If you knew how,
you would not need
to learn.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.698
Observe!

02:46.700 --> 02:48.100
Right, yes, okay.
But what do I...

02:48.102 --> 02:49.201
Shh.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.471
Yes.

02:52.473 --> 02:55.474
Ooh! You're listening to
the Lions of the Past,
aren't you?

02:55.476 --> 02:58.143
What are they
saying Rafiki? Huh?
What are they...

02:58.145 --> 03:00.612
Oh...<i> Shwari.</i>

03:00.614 --> 03:02.181
Be calm.

03:02.183 --> 03:07.553
Yes. The Lions of the Past
tell me what the painting
needs to be!

03:08.122 --> 03:09.988
And now I know.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.657
(CHUCKLES)

03:11.659 --> 03:14.560
(HUMMING)

03:14.562 --> 03:18.030
How did you do that?
You make it look so easy!

03:18.032 --> 03:20.399
(LAUGHS) It is easy!

03:20.401 --> 03:22.401
After it is hard.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.303
Okay...

03:27.041 --> 03:28.106
Hmm.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.510
(LOUD THUD)
Whoa!

03:31.512 --> 03:34.413
CHAMA: We made it!
MHAZA: It's perfect!

03:34.415 --> 03:37.816
I'm not exactly sure
that's what the painting
needed to be.

03:37.818 --> 03:41.820
Most likely it is not.
It seems we have visitors.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.056
Hmm.

03:44.058 --> 03:48.393
FURAHA: (WHOOPING) Three
wild guys like us can
really be at home here!

03:48.395 --> 03:50.829
Indeed. My horns
love this tree!

03:50.831 --> 03:53.332
(WHOOPING, LAUGHS)

03:53.334 --> 03:55.901
Who is living
the good life now, huh?

03:55.903 --> 03:58.670
I am. I am!
(LAUGHS)

03:58.672 --> 04:02.007
Oh, yes. That is funny
because you are tapping me

04:02.009 --> 04:04.743
and yet when I turn around
no one is there!

04:04.745 --> 04:06.011
(LAUGHING)

04:06.013 --> 04:08.046
(LAUGHING)

04:08.048 --> 04:11.583
Who are you three?
So young and full of life.

04:11.585 --> 04:15.921
Name's Chama,
this is Mzaha and Furaha.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.924
ALL: Chama cha Mzaha
na Furaha! Umph!

04:19.393 --> 04:21.426
(LAUGHING)

04:22.796 --> 04:24.796
And good news
for you, my friend.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.799
We fun guys
are living here now!

04:27.801 --> 04:28.967
(LAUGHS)

04:28.969 --> 04:30.702
Living the dream,
I'd say.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.037
(LAUGHTER)

04:33.807 --> 04:37.576
Live here? Ha!
You cannot live here.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.545
I need quiet
to train my apprentice.

04:40.547 --> 04:41.980
MAKINI: They won't bother me.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.815
They seem nice.
Makini?

04:43.817 --> 04:46.718
Hey, yeah! We are nice!
Nice and un!

04:46.720 --> 04:48.153
Just like you Rafiki!

04:48.155 --> 04:50.922
We see you
around the Pride Lands
talking with King Simba...

04:50.924 --> 04:54.793
(IMITATES RAFIKI)
Ha ha! I am wise,
and yet I have good time!

04:54.795 --> 04:57.829
Indeed! And that's
why we want to be
your neighbors!

04:57.831 --> 05:00.432
Come on, Rafiki.
It might be fun.

05:00.434 --> 05:04.469
Please. Please. Please?

05:05.406 --> 05:07.906
Eh... Very well.
Yay!

05:07.908 --> 05:09.841
(ALL CHEERING)

05:09.843 --> 05:13.211
As long as you are quiet!
(STOPS CHEERING)

05:14.448 --> 05:17.349
Makini must focus
on her training.

05:17.351 --> 05:20.485
She is painting for
the Royal Family tonight

05:20.487 --> 05:21.753
I am?

05:21.755 --> 05:22.821
You must be ready.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.457
Ha! You won't even
know we're here.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.925
Good. Come, Makini.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.594
(CHAMA BURPS LOUDLY)

05:30.664 --> 05:32.964
(CHUCKLES) Sorry,
won't happen again,

05:32.966 --> 05:34.966
(LAUGHTER)

05:34.968 --> 05:36.768
(LAUGHING)

05:36.770 --> 05:39.805
Zebras, the fire's out!

05:39.807 --> 05:42.207
BUNGA: Yeah!
You can stop running!

05:42.209 --> 05:44.009
(NEIGHS) Whoa!

05:46.013 --> 05:48.313
Can you tell me what you saw
when the fire started?

05:48.315 --> 05:52.184
Well, I saw the grass...

05:52.186 --> 05:54.052
Because you were grazing?

05:54.054 --> 05:55.721
Why, yes.

05:55.723 --> 05:59.224
Then I saw a big flash
of bright light!

05:59.226 --> 06:02.227
Wait. I actually know
what he's talking about.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.363
Lightning must have
started the fire!

06:04.365 --> 06:06.531
Lightning? But there
was no rain.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.233
That's because
it's dry lightning.

06:08.235 --> 06:11.870
It doesn't bring rain.
Quite common in
the dry season, really.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.005
Well there's nothing
to worry about now.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.674
You can all go back
to grazing.

06:15.676 --> 06:16.742
Fabulous.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.313
Uh, your grazing grounds
are this way.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.882
Oh. Right.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.184
Ono? Better
show them home.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.252
Affirmative.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.154
After me, zebras!

06:30.224 --> 06:32.791
You heard the bird.
After him.

06:34.695 --> 06:35.994
Zebras.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.930
RAFIKI: Ah, yes.
Much better!

06:38.932 --> 06:40.866
KION: Rafiki.

06:40.868 --> 06:44.002
I thought you were
training Makini for
the painting ceremony tonight.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.705
Makini is training.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.241
I am taking a break
from the noise.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.909
What noise?

06:50.911 --> 06:53.678
The noise that is
a young elephant,
monkey and antelope.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.114
They are now
living next to my tree!

06:56.116 --> 06:57.282
Next to your tree?

06:57.284 --> 06:58.850
Why aren't they
with their herds?

06:58.852 --> 07:00.952
Excellent question,
young hippo.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.054
And one I could not ask.

07:03.056 --> 07:06.858
They do not stop talking.
Except for when Makini talks!

07:06.860 --> 07:09.795
We'd better find out
why they're not
with their herds.

07:09.797 --> 07:13.465
Yes! And perhaps you
and the Lion Guard can take
them somewhere else.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.767
(CHANTING) Bug! Bug! Bug!

07:22.943 --> 07:25.610
And Furaha beats
his bug eating record!

07:25.612 --> 07:27.045
(CHEERING)

07:27.047 --> 07:31.483
Bug eating record?
Wait till you see
how many I can eat.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.985
I think I understand
your problem.

07:33.987 --> 07:36.154
(SCOFFS) Yeah.
You have three Bungas.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.658
Well, four now.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.761
Makini?
Is this practicing?

07:42.763 --> 07:45.464
I was just taking
a little break.
For inspiration!

07:45.466 --> 07:48.567
But now that
that's over I can really,
really focus on painting!

07:48.569 --> 07:51.102
Hey Chama.
Mzaha. Furaha.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.671
Why aren't you guys
with your herds?

07:52.673 --> 07:54.306
Uh... Short story, Beshte.

07:54.308 --> 07:56.575
They kicked us out.
You know how it goes.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.577
Kicked out?
By your own herds?

07:58.579 --> 07:59.744
Why?

07:59.746 --> 08:01.813
Beats... (BURPS) Me.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.482
(BURPING) Do not know.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.150
(BURPS) Nope.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.352
(SLURPS) Oh! Oh!
I can burp too!

08:07.354 --> 08:08.954
(BURPS)

08:08.956 --> 08:10.956
Ugh. Seriously?

08:10.958 --> 08:13.091
I'm sure it's some kinda
misunderstanding.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.494
Your herds are
probably worried about you.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.996
We can take you back
to your families.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.364
If that's what you want.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.933
Yes, yes.
Back to their families.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.135
Being with your herd
is part of your role

08:24.137 --> 08:25.504
in the Circle of Life!

08:25.506 --> 08:29.140
Circle of Life?
Whoa! In that case,
we better go back!

08:29.142 --> 08:30.942
You said it.
Indeed.

08:30.944 --> 08:34.145
But, uh, guess that means
we three gotta
say good-bye, huh?

08:34.147 --> 08:36.381
But without you
two fun guys

08:36.383 --> 08:39.150
I will just be one fun guy...

08:39.152 --> 08:41.553
Kion, the zebras
are all home safe!

08:41.555 --> 08:43.121
Good work, Ono.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.558
Now I'll need you
and Beshte to take Furaha
back to his troop.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.493
Affirmative,
You got it, Kion.

08:48.495 --> 08:51.696
Bunga, we'll take Chama
back to Ma Tembo's herd.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.832
Fuli, you've got Mzaha.

08:53.834 --> 08:57.068
Okay, you three. Come on.
Let's take you back home.

08:58.572 --> 09:02.140
ALL: (SADLY) Chama cha Mzaha
na Furaha... Umph.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.210
(LAUGHING WEAKLY)

09:05.212 --> 09:07.779
Okay, then.
See ya around, pals.

09:11.084 --> 09:14.252
I bet your troop is gonna be
happy to see you, Furaha.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.087
Happier than when
they saw me leave?

09:16.089 --> 09:19.157
Hey, Furaha! I see your
troop in those trees!

09:19.159 --> 09:22.227
(WHOOPING) Ready or not,
here comes fun!

09:22.229 --> 09:24.262
(WHOOPING)

09:24.264 --> 09:27.265
Tumbili! Tumbili!

09:27.267 --> 09:29.434
(GROANS) Furaha.

09:29.436 --> 09:32.737
You were thinking, "When is
that fun guy coming back?"

09:32.739 --> 09:34.839
Well, here I am!

09:34.841 --> 09:37.375
Cousins! Who here
missed Furaha?

09:37.377 --> 09:38.843
Hey, Tumbili.

09:38.845 --> 09:42.013
Can you believe Furaha was
living at Rafiki's Tree?

09:42.015 --> 09:43.915
He thought he had
been kicked out of the troop!

09:43.917 --> 09:45.550
Well, uh...

09:45.552 --> 09:48.420
You see, Beshte.
It is the Monkey way
to, uh...

09:48.422 --> 09:50.355
I knew you'd welcome him back!

09:50.357 --> 09:54.726
(SIGHS) Yes. Thank you
for bringing Furaha home.

09:54.728 --> 09:55.927
Enjoy your family.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.195
Bye, Furaha!

09:57.631 --> 09:59.798
(LAUGHING)

09:59.800 --> 10:01.466
Who is having fun now?

10:01.468 --> 10:04.235
(MONKEY YELPS)
MONKEY: Stop it, Furaha!

10:04.237 --> 10:07.572
BUPU: I don't care what
the Lion Guard wants us to do.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.808
We aren't taking
Mzaha back.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.443
But he's one of your kind.

10:11.445 --> 10:14.579
And he was sent away
for good reason.

10:14.581 --> 10:18.383
Okay, look. I understand
Mzaha might be a little...

10:18.385 --> 10:20.151
(LAUGHING)

10:20.153 --> 10:22.988
...different. But shouldn't he
be with his family?

10:22.990 --> 10:25.090
(MZAHA LAUGHING)

10:25.092 --> 10:27.325
(SIGHS) Take him back, Bupu.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.927
Don't feel like it.

10:28.929 --> 10:29.995
Please?

10:30.897 --> 10:33.164
Ah, yes. Very well.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.233
It never hurts
to be polite!
(MZAHA LAUGHING)

10:35.235 --> 10:38.269
Mzaha, you are back
with the herd!

10:38.271 --> 10:41.306
Oh, goodie,
I'm back! I'm back!

10:41.308 --> 10:43.475
Great! Thanks, Bupu!

10:43.477 --> 10:46.511
Who wants to play tag?
You? Or you?
(GRUNTS)

10:46.513 --> 10:48.346
I know you do!

10:48.348 --> 10:50.315
(SIGHS)

10:50.317 --> 10:53.685
I know how important
family is to you elephants,
Ma Tembo.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.320
That's true, Kion.

10:55.322 --> 10:59.357
But Chama was a disruption
to the herd.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.026
(TRUMPETS)

11:03.163 --> 11:06.464
That was
un-bunga-lieveable!

11:06.466 --> 11:08.133
Let's do it again!

11:08.135 --> 11:09.200
KION: Bunga!

11:11.171 --> 11:14.205
