00:01.102 --> 00:02.735
Previously
 on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.770 --> 00:05.106
You love him. Say it.

00:05.139 --> 00:07.041
I just want to be his
friend, just like I want
to be all of their friends.

00:07.075 --> 00:09.043
Why don't you understand me?
(scoffs)

00:09.077 --> 00:12.313
Why did she move here again?
She was offered
a killer job in town.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.748
Why else would she move here?

00:14.782 --> 00:18.652
You called me. You said,
"I will work for super cheap.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.788
I just really want to
live in West Covina."

00:20.821 --> 00:23.624
REBECCA: Josh found out
 I've been lying, and...

00:23.657 --> 00:25.393
instead of turning his back
on me,

00:25.426 --> 00:27.228
he just opened up.
I'm so happy

00:27.261 --> 00:30.598
that you're in town, and I
don't think you're crazy at all.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.600
I love him so much.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.736
* I was working hard
at a New York job *

00:35.769 --> 00:37.605
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

00:37.638 --> 00:39.340
* One day I was crying a lot

00:39.373 --> 00:40.541
* And so I decided to move

00:40.574 --> 00:42.276
* To West Covina, California

00:42.310 --> 00:43.511
* Brand-new pals
and new career *

00:43.544 --> 00:45.513
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

00:45.546 --> 00:48.349
* But that's not why I'm here

00:48.382 --> 00:50.484
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.220
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

00:52.253 --> 00:53.221
That's a sexist term.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.755
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

00:54.788 --> 00:56.090
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

00:56.124 --> 00:58.592
* She's so broken inside *

00:58.626 --> 01:00.228
The situation's
a lot more nuanced than that.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.263
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

01:02.296 --> 01:03.597
Okay! We get it!

01:03.631 --> 01:05.566
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

01:05.599 --> 01:07.435
Say it again.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.203
I love him.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.371
Say it with his name.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.505
I love Josh.

01:11.539 --> 01:12.740
Say his full name.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.742
(laughing):
Paula, I'm not...

01:15.676 --> 01:17.111
(sighs) I love...

01:17.145 --> 01:19.613
Joshua Felix Chan.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.249
(both laugh)

01:21.282 --> 01:23.517
"Mr. and Mrs. Bunch request
the honor of your presence

01:23.551 --> 01:25.253
"at the wedding
of their daughter

01:25.286 --> 01:28.756
Rebecca Nora Bunch
and Joshua Felix Chan."

01:28.789 --> 01:31.125
Paula, we're not close to
getting married, you know.

01:31.159 --> 01:34.762
It's not like I've been Googling
pictures of mixed-race babies.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.231
They're so cute-- they're so
much cuter than the plain ones.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.632
And you're not
in denial anymore,

01:38.666 --> 01:40.534
and that is the first step.
(gasps)

01:40.568 --> 01:42.770
Yay.
Yay. Okay,
so what's the plan?

01:42.803 --> 01:45.139
I have one. You break
into his apartment one night

01:45.173 --> 01:47.341
when you know Valencia is off
on one of her yoga retreats,

01:47.375 --> 01:50.444
he comes home,
you're in bed, naked.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.713
I did that at least ten times
in the '90s,

01:52.746 --> 01:55.783
and it worked every time.
He has

01:55.816 --> 01:57.418
a live-in girlfriend.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.187
I'm not gonna
just break them up.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.289
It's against my moral code.
Oh,

02:01.322 --> 02:03.391
your morals are not up to code,
honey.

02:03.424 --> 02:04.558
Hey.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.460
Sorry.
I just wish
there was some way

02:06.494 --> 02:08.461
for him to remember how it felt
when we were at camp together,

02:08.496 --> 02:12.166
you know? Every time we saw
each other, it was like...

02:12.200 --> 02:16.570
it was like Cupid's arrow went
straight through our hearts.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.738
Gotcha, Becks! (laughs)

02:17.771 --> 02:19.173
Josh!
Hey,

02:19.207 --> 02:20.474
I'll take a few of these

02:20.508 --> 02:22.610
and just ten of everything
and one boba tea to go.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.744
Wow, you're hungry.

02:23.777 --> 02:24.812
Oh, they're not for me.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.314
They're for my kids.

02:26.347 --> 02:26.947
Oh,

02:26.980 --> 02:27.848
hi.

02:27.881 --> 02:28.849
Paula.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.418
We met at Rebecca's party.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.420
Of course. Hello, ma'am.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.722
I'm not a... ma'am.
Now's not the time.

02:34.755 --> 02:35.856
What kids
are you buying candy for?

02:35.889 --> 02:37.391
Oh, it's this thing
I do every year.

02:37.425 --> 02:39.527
Um, volunteer at a program
for disadvantaged teens.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.595
Oh, my gosh,
that's so sweet.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.896
Well, I like to give back.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.366
They're a tough bunch,
but you know how kids are.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.201
You let 'em make a s'more
in the great outdoors,

02:47.235 --> 02:48.302
and their defenses just melt.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.571
S'more? W-W... Wait, s'when?

02:50.604 --> 02:52.206
S'where? With s'who? (chuckles)

02:52.240 --> 02:53.741
(laughs)
I like that. That's cute.

02:53.774 --> 02:54.742
Yeah.
Yeah, we go to Riverside

02:54.775 --> 02:56.577
and stay at this park overnight.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.745
It's just like summer camp.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.213
(echoing):
 Summer camp. Summer camp.

02:59.247 --> 03:01.349
Summer camp.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.250
PAULA:
That sounds

03:02.283 --> 03:03.751
like fun.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.487
And so romantic
for you and, uh, Valencia?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.356
Oh, she doesn't come.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.857
Actually,
she's not happy I'm going.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.359
She thinks I should be working.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.494
She has this theory
that time is money.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.795
You know who
loves camp?

03:14.828 --> 03:17.498
I mean, like, has a PhD in camp

03:17.531 --> 03:19.733
and could do a
lot for all those

03:19.767 --> 03:23.271
underprivileged...
whatever-they-ares, this one

03:23.304 --> 03:24.238
right here.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.940
Well, you know,
we're always looking for help.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.676
I'll-I'll tell them
you'll come to the office

03:28.709 --> 03:29.943
and see the camp director.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.612
Great. (chuckles)

03:31.645 --> 03:33.347
Okay. Got to jet. Um...

03:33.381 --> 03:34.882
Ooh, thanks so much.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.484
Okay, good to see you guys!

03:36.517 --> 03:37.751
Bye, Josh! Bye!
Bye!

03:37.785 --> 03:38.686
Bye!
Bye!

03:38.719 --> 03:40.554
Okay, you have got
to get into that camp.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.923
This is your chance to go back
when you two fell in love.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.892
Okay. I'm gonna go see
the camp director.

03:44.925 --> 03:45.826
(squeals)

03:45.859 --> 03:48.262
I can't run in these.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.298
(chuckles)

03:54.702 --> 03:57.838
You're just so cute
for buying candy for the kids.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.807
Even though
you know

03:59.840 --> 04:03.544
giving kids sweets
is like giving them cigarettes.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.812
Everybody loves candy.

04:04.845 --> 04:09.417
You're just so nice for doing
that camp program every year,

04:09.450 --> 04:12.052
passing up all those extra hours
at work

04:12.085 --> 04:14.788
that could get you promoted
to manager.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.890
You know, I don't mind.
I love those kids.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.293
Maybe because you're like
a big kid yourself.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.363
That's why you're so good
at talking to them.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.531
And one day,

04:23.564 --> 04:26.834
when we have kids and they say,
"Why don't we have shoes?"

04:26.867 --> 04:31.071
you can say, "So that other kids
can have candy."

04:31.104 --> 04:35.075
Um, V, sometimes it's like...
(scoffs)

04:35.108 --> 04:37.811
like you don't understand me
or...

04:37.845 --> 04:39.747
even believe in me.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.014
It sucks.

04:41.048 --> 04:44.585
What? Of course I do.
I believe that

04:44.618 --> 04:45.686
one day you will focus

04:45.719 --> 04:49.657
on our future
instead of fun stuff.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.692
Mmm.

04:52.860 --> 04:53.827
Your little nose.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.863
(squeaks)

04:58.466 --> 04:59.800
So, Josh said
you wanted to help.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.469
We would love for you to get
involved.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.436
You know, people think

05:02.470 --> 05:05.639
of West Covina
as this prosperous suburb...

05:05.673 --> 05:07.641
But ten percent of its residents
live below the poverty line.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.377
I know.
And I am willing to help.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.445
I've cleared my schedule.
So, here are my ideas.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.981
I can host a really good
game of tug-of-war,

05:14.014 --> 05:16.350
I know a great recipe
for organic bug juice,

05:16.384 --> 05:18.652
and don't even get me
started on my lanyard skills.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.788
Okay, we don't need
any more counselors.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.822
We're covered there.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.024
Okay. Forget the bug juice.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.493
Here's what I can offer:

05:25.526 --> 05:27.495
a female empowerment program.
Hear me out.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.398
I did it at my old high school
in Scarsdale. Huge success.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.633
All the girls ended up
on the Pill because of me.

05:32.666 --> 05:36.370
Listen, Rebecca,
when we say, "Get involved,"

05:36.404 --> 05:38.906
what we mean is,
"Give us money."

05:38.939 --> 05:40.541
Our lawyers wouldn't let us
put, "Just give us

05:40.574 --> 05:42.410
some damn money" on the posters.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.912
Well, great. Okay, so if I give
you money, I can come to camp?

05:44.945 --> 05:47.515
No, no. Donors don't come
to the camp, Ms. Bunch,

05:47.548 --> 05:48.782
no matter how much money
they give.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.652
Here you go.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.855
This'll do.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.057
(laughs)
Welcome aboard.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.528
You are the new Director
of Female Empowerment.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.695
Yes! (chuckles)

06:03.096 --> 06:06.467
(horn honking)

06:08.569 --> 06:10.838
(chuckles)

06:10.871 --> 06:13.807
(both sigh)

06:13.841 --> 06:16.410
I was thinking about seeing a
movie tonight. You want to go?

06:16.444 --> 06:17.811
Oh, never mind.

06:17.845 --> 06:18.946
I forgot you
and your friends
Mmm...

06:18.979 --> 06:20.981
ironically watch Empire.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.551
Yeah, it's not ironic
for me anymore.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.686
Taraji's my everything.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.588
(chuckles)
But I can blow it off.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.857
No. I don't want you to do that.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.426
Why not? I like you.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.728
(commentator speaking
indistinctly on TV)

06:34.762 --> 06:37.731
I like you a lot, Greg.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.567
(chuckles, mutters)

06:39.600 --> 06:41.569
"I like you a lot, Greg."

06:41.602 --> 06:44.004
That's-that's funny.

06:44.037 --> 06:47.741
Yeah, no,
I'm, like, excited about this.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.143
I have butterflies.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.712
You can't tell?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.714
It's subtle.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.148
I'm serious.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.851
We've been hooking up for
a few weeks, and I'm into it.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.187
I'm not seeing
other guys anymore.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.458
What?

07:04.492 --> 07:05.726
So obviously

07:05.759 --> 07:07.461
I told her we needed some space.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.229
Because not seeing other people

07:09.262 --> 07:11.832
is like an inch away
from hiring a wedding band.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.867
It's better this way.
We have too many differences.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.002
She likes Chuck Palahniuk,

07:15.035 --> 07:16.504
and I think it's pretty obvious

07:16.537 --> 07:18.171
after Fight Club,
he's a one-trick pony.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.740
Dude.
What?

07:19.773 --> 07:20.874
I've been watching
 The View lately,

07:20.908 --> 07:22.610
and you're a commitment-phobe.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.678
(chuckles)
I am not.

07:24.712 --> 07:25.813
You're, like,
making up problems

07:25.846 --> 07:26.914
as an excuse
to break up with her.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.082
I think your behavior
reflects a deep-seated fear

07:29.116 --> 07:31.084
that if you love somebody,
she'll leave you.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.854
It's probably rooted in
your childhood trauma.

07:33.887 --> 07:37.190
Stop-stop
with your armchair psychology.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.626
I appreciated that insight.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.093
You're the only
one who gets me.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.762
We're just not compatible.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.497
If the perfect girl walked in
right now

07:43.531 --> 07:45.899
and said, "Greg, I like you,"

07:45.933 --> 07:49.903
I would be into it. Totally.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.005
Hey! My beach buds!
Hey! Oh.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.841
Yeah.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.843
What's up? Oh, you must be
the dude that overslept.

07:55.876 --> 07:56.910
Hector.
Hector.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.512
So, uh,

07:58.546 --> 07:59.647
what's up with you?
You know,

07:59.680 --> 08:01.649
my, uh, ex-wife,
she took Madison

08:01.682 --> 08:05.653
for the weekend, and I have
just been stone-cold chillin'.

08:05.686 --> 08:06.820
(crying):
I know.

08:06.854 --> 08:10.190
I miss her, too,
Snail-iana Grande.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.059
How about you cats?
What have you guys been up to?

08:12.092 --> 08:14.061
You know, we were just
talking about trying

08:14.094 --> 08:15.696
to watch this fight,
but it's, uh, Pay-per-view,

08:15.729 --> 08:16.697
so it's a little expensive.

08:16.730 --> 08:17.698
The one you mean with the,

08:17.731 --> 08:19.700
the two guys that are
like this on the poster?

08:19.733 --> 08:20.568
That's the one.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.002
Yep.
Oh!

08:22.035 --> 08:23.070
Well, I was totally
planning on watching that.

08:23.103 --> 08:23.837
Yeah?

08:23.871 --> 08:24.905
You know what?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.039
Why don't you guys come over

08:26.073 --> 08:27.074
and we can all
watch it together?

08:27.107 --> 08:27.808
HECTOR:
Wha--?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.710
That would be awesome actually.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.278
I'm in. I don't have any plans
this weekend anymore.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.714
Free man.
No one tying me down.

08:33.746 --> 08:36.082
(laughs):
Oh, this is great then!

08:36.116 --> 08:37.317
This is awesome!

08:37.350 --> 08:39.787
And we'll have ourselves
a little party, you dig?

08:39.820 --> 08:41.722
I dig.
All right!
I-I also dig.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.890
You know, here's
a little known fact.

08:43.924 --> 08:47.094
I used to be the social director
of my frat back in college.
No.

08:47.127 --> 08:47.961
Yeah.
No way.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.863
They used to call me
king of the spread.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.566
Oh, nice, 'cause you had
your way with the ladies?

08:52.600 --> 08:54.668
No, it was because I make pâté.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.069
It's all in the onions.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.238
You have to caramelize
for, like, 18 hours.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.574
Which if I leave right now,

09:00.608 --> 09:03.911
I will have everything
ready to spready.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.679
Spready, all right.
Spready.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.748
I'll bring some crackers.
Oh, that'd be great, great.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.717
Um, lend an ear.

09:09.750 --> 09:10.651
Yeah.
Um,

09:10.684 --> 09:11.852
the, uh, fight?

09:11.885 --> 09:13.353
That's boxing, right?

09:13.386 --> 09:15.589
(bell dings)

09:15.623 --> 09:16.890
Okay, feeling good?
Feeling loose?

09:16.924 --> 09:18.158
Yeah.
Feeling cute?
Feeling 16?

09:18.191 --> 09:19.593
Yeah.
All right, get your
head in the game.

09:19.627 --> 09:20.327
Okay.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.329
Spit.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.764
Cut me.
Okay.

09:24.798 --> 09:25.866
All right.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.968
Inventory.

09:28.001 --> 09:31.204
Handi Wipes, trail mix,
flashlight, bug spray--

09:31.238 --> 09:32.873
Oh, some extra toilet paper.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.141
Heaven forbid you
have to use leaves.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.308
Oh, I got a rash one time.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.610
It almost made me infertile.

09:36.644 --> 09:39.012
Unfortunately, it did not.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.614
Do you need anything else?

09:40.648 --> 09:41.514
I don't think so, no.
Okay.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.250
Oh, there's one thing
I have to show you.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.718
So this is a letter

09:44.752 --> 09:46.654
that I wrote to Josh
our last day of camp.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.055
I was gonna give it
to him and then he...

09:48.088 --> 09:49.189
you know,
he broke up with me.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.624
So I was gonna mail it to him,
then I decided not to.

09:50.658 --> 09:51.692
So I decided to burn it,

09:51.725 --> 09:52.826
but then I didn't
do that, either.

09:52.860 --> 09:53.927
That's why it's
a little scorched.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.295
Anyway, I want to get him alone

09:55.328 --> 09:57.064
and read him this letter.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.732
And I think if I do,

09:58.766 --> 10:00.934
all of his feelings from when
we were together at camp--

10:00.968 --> 10:02.335
you know, falling in love
under the stars--

10:02.369 --> 10:03.671
it-it'll come back to him.

10:03.704 --> 10:04.872
Tell me what you think.

10:04.905 --> 10:08.909
* Dear Joshua Felix Chan

10:08.942 --> 10:13.146
* I remember the moment
it beg-- *

10:13.180 --> 10:14.247
Yeah, no.
Uh-uh.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.082
No, no, no.
What?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.149
Don't do this.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.284
This is dumb.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.852
You're a grown-ass lady.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.353
You don't need cutesy letters
from childhood.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.022
You just need to use
what God gave you.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.024
My charm and my wit?

10:24.057 --> 10:25.926
It's a weird name
for your boobs.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.728
Actually, my boobs names
are Bonnie and Clyde.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.663
And my ovaries
are Hustle and Flow.

10:29.697 --> 10:30.798
Oh, oh, oh!

10:30.831 --> 10:31.965
That is nice!

10:31.999 --> 10:33.133
Yeah, yeah, I know.
All right.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.401
Forget the letter.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.435
Okay.
All right?

10:35.468 --> 10:38.338
And just go...

10:38.371 --> 10:40.240
get him, kiddo. Boop.
Okay.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.910
Josh, Josh! Hey, hey, Josh!

10:42.943 --> 10:44.077
Hey! It's so cool
that you're here.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.178
Yeah.
I heard you're

10:45.212 --> 10:46.346
giving a lecture or something.

10:46.379 --> 10:49.449
Oh, yeah, gonna, you know,
help out the young females.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.684
Teach them about wage gaps,

10:50.718 --> 10:52.686
leaning in, glass ceilings,

10:52.720 --> 10:54.254
internalized misogyny,
slut-shaming, et cetera.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.156
So you look great.
Uh, thanks.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.958
My disciples. Watch this.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.960
Hey, ladies, be prepared
to shed your preconceived

10:59.993 --> 11:02.095
notions about your limitations.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.064
Be prepared
to get made fun of all weekend.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.934
You look like
a cabbage patch kid.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.102
That's funny. No, they're...

11:09.136 --> 11:10.838
They're just...
It's warming up. So, camp,

11:10.871 --> 11:13.907
huh? It's gonna be like old
times. It's gonna be so rad!

11:13.941 --> 11:16.243
Oh! Yeah.
Bang, bang. Do you want
to take a selfie?

11:16.276 --> 11:19.112
Oh, yeah, I need some good ones.
My LPPs are down.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.280
L... Hmm?

11:20.313 --> 11:21.381
Likes per post.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.017
Oh, got it, great.
Yeah.
Bro.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.253
We saved you a seat.
Cool. Um, sorry,
got to go, Becks.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.788
Uh, we'll do the selfie there.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.189
Okay. I...

11:29.222 --> 11:30.223
Selfie there.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.259
Cool, got it.

11:32.292 --> 11:35.963
Bet you wish you had
a glass ceiling over you now.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.365
That's not really
what a glass ceiling is.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.000
(cackling)

11:50.277 --> 11:51.845
(house music playing)

12:02.055 --> 12:04.124
(distorted):
* Having a few people over

12:04.157 --> 12:06.226
*

12:24.845 --> 12:26.546
* Having a few people over

12:26.579 --> 12:29.149
*

12:33.386 --> 12:35.956
(distorted):
* Having a few, few-few-few

12:35.989 --> 12:37.958
* Having a few people over

12:37.991 --> 12:39.359
* Having, have-have,
few, few-few

12:39.392 --> 12:41.494
* Having a few people over...

12:41.528 --> 12:42.996
*

12:50.904 --> 12:52.873
At this point
you're probably aware

12:52.906 --> 12:54.141
I'm having a few people over.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.310
(crowd clamoring)

12:57.344 --> 12:59.579
Little astringent.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.414
When does
the main fight start?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.150
There's still
three more undercard fights.

13:03.183 --> 13:06.887
I always forget
how boring boxing is. Uh...

13:06.920 --> 13:08.155
Yeah, I might want to bail.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.489
Oh, guys, come on,
come on, come on.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.824
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.893
We're just getting
started here, right?

13:12.926 --> 13:15.162
Plus I need, like, 20 more
minutes on the onions.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.130
We should go to that new bar
on East Cameron.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.899
Saw some honeys there
last week.
Oh, yeah?

13:18.932 --> 13:19.933
No, no, no, no,
no, no, guys.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.269
You want honeys? Hey,
come on, I know honeys.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.172
Look, I didn't want
to say this earlier,

13:25.205 --> 13:26.406
but my thought--
my plan was--

13:26.439 --> 13:29.843
at first we'd have a little bro
time, which is what this is,

13:29.877 --> 13:32.312
and then a honey hang, right?

13:32.345 --> 13:35.949
Just give it a second.
I got a plan.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.419
Come on, get in,
get in, bring it in.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.021
Sorry, sorry,
donor coming through.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.190
Donor coming through,
donor come through. Okay.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.424
All right.
All right, girls,

13:44.457 --> 13:45.893
uh, let's start with elbow tag.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.061
The classic game of tag
with a twist.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.329
You link arms
with a partner.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.563
So everyone grab a partner.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.032
Oh, teamsies.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.935
Sorry, Becks.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.203
Best lady wins.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.470
It's fine. She is
younger and faster.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.605
Kudos. (chuckles)

13:58.638 --> 14:00.140
Don't worry,

14:00.173 --> 14:02.609
Nicky will be your partner.

14:02.642 --> 14:05.278
Oh. Hi, Nicky.
What is Nicky short for?

14:05.312 --> 14:07.080
Samantha.
What?

14:07.114 --> 14:08.348
And I play to win.

14:08.381 --> 14:11.952
I admire that work ethic,
Samantha.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.921
* Get out of the classroom,
I'll meet you in the bathroom *

14:13.954 --> 14:15.956
* Climb out of the window,
find a car, go zoom, zoom *

14:15.989 --> 14:17.958
* Drivin' away,
we got to play... *

14:17.991 --> 14:19.226
No, you're going the wrong way.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.961
No, this way.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.629
Don't tell me what to do!

14:22.662 --> 14:23.630
Oh!

14:23.663 --> 14:27.367
Oh...

14:27.400 --> 14:28.535
Cabbage Patch down!

14:28.568 --> 14:30.537
(groaning)

14:33.340 --> 14:34.942
(sighs)

14:34.975 --> 14:38.111
"How... to get...

14:38.145 --> 14:40.580
"girls to your party

14:40.613 --> 14:43.116
right now."

14:43.150 --> 14:44.551
(phone chimes)

14:44.584 --> 14:46.586
"Sofistic8ed Party Casting"?

14:50.023 --> 14:51.925
WOMAN: Do you need to crank
your party up a notch?

14:51.959 --> 14:54.127
Well, now there are
hundreds of girls

14:54.161 --> 14:55.295
waiting to join the fun.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.396
Huh.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.397
Sofistic8ed Party Casting.

14:57.430 --> 15:00.133
The premier party casting app
on the market.

15:00.167 --> 15:02.135
You pay, they play.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.972
Get quality, upscale, classy,
local female guests

15:05.005 --> 15:06.639
to your party
in under 30 minutes.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.008
Well, it's local.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.276
That's good for the economy.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.078
Turn your regular party

15:11.111 --> 15:13.546
into a sophisticated party.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.182
Oh. Uh...

15:15.215 --> 15:17.184
Number of girls.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.086
Oh, gosh, I don't know.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.221
Um... 25?

15:21.254 --> 15:22.622
Wow.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.091
That's expensive.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.159
What looks good?

15:26.193 --> 15:27.560
You sure you're okay?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.696
Oh, this?

15:29.729 --> 15:31.164
Yeah, it's just
some busted capillaries.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.432
No big.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.135
So, um... hey, do you want to,

15:35.168 --> 15:37.037
like, go sit
at a table somewhere?

15:37.070 --> 15:40.573
I've been craving
some Josh Chan quality time.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.076
Oh, I'd love to,
but I got to sit with the boys.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.345
You know how camp is,
boys versus girls,

15:45.378 --> 15:46.980
girls have cooties, bleh.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.215
(laughs)
Right. Right, right.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.749
I was thinking the same thing,
like, ugh, you're so gross,

15:49.782 --> 15:51.251
get away from me.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.285
Okay. I'll catch you...

15:52.319 --> 15:54.321
Yeah.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.356
(sighs)

15:57.790 --> 15:59.993
Hey, can I...
can I squeeze inskies?

16:00.027 --> 16:00.994
Nope.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.362
I think it's just rachet.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.031
I admire that confidence.
It is crusty.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.165
Exactly.
Nothing, right?

16:05.198 --> 16:06.499
His name is Phil.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.734
His name
is Phil.
(laughter)

16:07.767 --> 16:08.735
First sign.
That should've been...

16:08.768 --> 16:09.802
Hey, I'm just gonna...

16:09.836 --> 16:12.205
Can I, can I scoot in here?
Can I scoot in here?

16:12.239 --> 16:13.473
You know what? I'm gonna be...

16:13.506 --> 16:14.774
sorry, I'm just gonna
be confident like her.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.443
I'm sorry, I'm just gonna
be confident like her

16:16.476 --> 16:17.610
and I'm just gonna get in.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.611
Great.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.180
Hey, is anyone else

16:20.213 --> 16:22.582
getting bitten up
by mosquitoes around here?

16:22.615 --> 16:25.218
Maybe it's just me
with my sweet, sweet skin.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.087
So I called him,
then I texted him,

16:27.120 --> 16:29.089
then I Snapchatted him;
never heard back from him.

16:29.122 --> 16:32.725
Next thing I know, he's on
a waterslide with some skank.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.061
And he tagged me in the picture.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.062
No, he didn't!
Yes!

16:35.095 --> 16:36.063
That is so like him.
He tagged me.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.064
Are you kidding?
Right?!

16:37.097 --> 16:38.398
So like him.
Dumb!

16:38.431 --> 16:40.200
You know what, that's,
that's a crazy thing to do,

16:40.233 --> 16:42.369
but honestly,
when we focus on men,

16:42.402 --> 16:43.736
it just makes them
more powerful.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.572
So just forget this guy.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.607
I promise you, in ten years,
you won't even remember him.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.608
JOSH:
#BaseballCap!

16:48.641 --> 16:50.610
(camera clicks, laughter)

16:50.643 --> 16:52.112
#Bandana!

16:52.145 --> 16:53.380
GIRL:
It's intentional.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.648
#TearTattoo!

16:55.682 --> 16:56.616
I'm sorry,
really quick question:

16:56.649 --> 16:57.650
Is there a place around here

16:57.684 --> 16:58.651
to take a photo?

16:58.685 --> 17:00.087
Like, away from everything else?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.654
To go into nature

17:01.688 --> 17:04.824
and just take a photo
of myself, alone?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.459
Good idea.

17:06.492 --> 17:07.594
Go be alone.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.362
Ooh!
(laughter)

17:09.396 --> 17:10.630
Went there.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.464
I really don't like
this woman-on... Look at me.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.567
I really don't like this
woman-on-woman aggression.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.536
Like, instead of
cutting each other down,

17:16.569 --> 17:17.770
we should be
building each other up.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.772
Like Kayla-- you, for instance,
have a real air of gravitas.

17:20.807 --> 17:21.840
I do not.

17:21.874 --> 17:22.842
I've been tested.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.675
Amen.
She has been.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.145
Several times.
Yeah.

17:25.178 --> 17:25.877
That's not what an air
of grav... never mind.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.079
Let's circle back to the photo.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.115
Where can I take a photo?

17:28.147 --> 17:30.283
Well, there's Blowie Point
at the top of the hill.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.085
Blowie Point?
Oh, 'cause it's windy?

17:32.119 --> 17:33.553
Yup.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.388
So windy it knocks you
to your knees.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.224
That's a hazard.
Mm-hmm.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.491
We should put
handrails up there.

17:38.525 --> 17:39.726
Okay, well,
I'll bring my windbreaker.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.295
Uh, thank you, sister friends.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.430
Girl power.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.198
Bye. Bye.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.566
(laughter)

17:46.599 --> 17:49.236
(women chatting, laughing)

17:53.706 --> 17:55.475
Now, this is a party.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.144
You really came through, D-Dawg.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.145
(laughs)
D-Dawg.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.212
(barks)

17:59.246 --> 18:00.713
Right?
Oh, yeah.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.449
Darryl just barked
like a dog.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.117
Are we sure he's not...
he's okay?

18:04.151 --> 18:05.185
WHITE JOSH:
He may not be.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.186
There's, uh...

18:06.219 --> 18:08.155
a lot of girls here, dude.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.656
GREG: Yeah, but men spend too
much time thinking about women.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.324
We should spend more time

18:11.358 --> 18:12.859
in-in drum circles,

18:12.892 --> 18:14.761
in wielding swords,
in chopping wood...

18:14.794 --> 18:17.297
What are we
talking about, man?

18:18.898 --> 18:20.600
Wait a minute.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.734
Is that...?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.173
Whoa.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.140
Ashley Pratt.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.608
Dude, you were in love
with her since, like...

18:28.641 --> 18:30.877
Kindergarten.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.245
She's perfect.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.749
That is the perfect woman.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.851
Ashley would never come
to our parties in high school.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.887
She's an actress in L.A. now,
did you know that?

18:40.920 --> 18:43.323
She played a sexy barista
on Last Man Standing

18:43.356 --> 18:44.824
and then a sad barista

18:44.857 --> 18:46.759
in the
 Entourage movie...
Okay.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.162
...and then in Battlestar
she was a space barista.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.697
I bet she makes hot coffee.

18:51.798 --> 18:52.899
Here she comes.
She's coming.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.367
She's coming. Just...
No, no, no.

18:54.401 --> 18:55.868
What do we say?
No, she's-she's stopping.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.537
She stopped.
That's fine.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.272
No, she's coming.
(mumbling)

19:00.773 --> 19:02.542
Josh. Uh, do you remember

19:02.575 --> 19:04.811
how you were telling me
about Instagram LPPs,

19:04.844 --> 19:06.213
Likes Per Post?

19:06.246 --> 19:07.780
Well, I'm reading
an article right now

19:07.814 --> 19:09.949
that says to maximize your LPPs,

19:09.982 --> 19:11.551
you want to take sunset photos.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.885
I know, right?

19:12.919 --> 19:14.521
They're actually
the most liked photos,

19:14.554 --> 19:16.423
behind fitness girls
with big butts

19:16.456 --> 19:17.424
and slow-motion dogs.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.458
Really?

19:18.491 --> 19:19.659
Yeah, they used an algorithm.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.294
Oh, no.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.795
Yeah, no... it's a math thing.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.931
So, anyway...
Oh.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.533
I think I'm gonna go
up the hill at sunset.

19:26.566 --> 19:27.800
and take some selfies
at Blowie Point.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.569
(snorts)
Blowie Point?

19:29.602 --> 19:30.870
Yeah, I know it's
really windy up there.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.605
I'm-I'm bringing
my windbreaker.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.507
But anyway, I just came
to let you know

19:34.541 --> 19:36.509
that tonight I think
my Instagram likes

19:36.543 --> 19:37.610
are gonna hit the trip digs.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.679
(clicks tongue)
Oh, maybe I should
go up with you.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.414
Um... ooh...

19:41.448 --> 19:42.949
I don't know if I want
you going up with me

19:42.982 --> 19:44.984
and competing with me
for Instagram likes.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.454
I kind of want to beat you
in that regard, you know?

19:47.487 --> 19:48.755
All right, you are on.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.457
Meet you up there at sunset.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.558
Okay.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.992
Now it's a challenge.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.462
I'll see you up there, Chan.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.829
Bring your windbreaker.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.431
(laughs)

19:58.465 --> 20:00.367
Oh, my God.
Hello.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.368
I know you guys

20:01.401 --> 20:02.502
from high school.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.603
You're Hector.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.772
You offered me pot
to go to a party

20:05.805 --> 20:07.340
and I punched you.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.575
I didn't press charges.

20:08.608 --> 20:09.976
You're White Josh.

20:10.009 --> 20:10.643
You're white

20:10.677 --> 20:11.978
and you look like Josh Chan

20:12.011 --> 20:12.979
who I, to this day,

20:13.012 --> 20:14.247
have a crush on.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.216
And you are...

20:18.485 --> 20:20.453
You are, um...

20:21.521 --> 20:22.989
Different high school. Private?

20:23.022 --> 20:24.023
Home-schooled.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.458
Yeah.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.726
You have a home-schooled look.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.595
What does that mean?

20:28.628 --> 20:29.496
No, I'm...

20:29.529 --> 20:30.863
No, I... hm-mmm.

20:30.897 --> 20:31.798
Uh, no.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.433
My locker was next to yours.

20:33.466 --> 20:34.467
Greg Serrano.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.669
Debate champion, math team,

20:36.703 --> 20:37.870
student body treasurer...

20:37.904 --> 20:39.806
Nope. Nothing.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.409
I campaigned on the platform
of personal pan pizzas.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.543
We never got those.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.677
Well, I was stuck

20:44.711 --> 20:46.613
with a lame duck
student council.

20:46.646 --> 20:47.747
(laughs)

20:47.780 --> 20:48.748
You're funny.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.683
Were you funny before?

20:50.717 --> 20:53.420
Yeah, I was hilarious.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.954
I just never said
the jokes out loud.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.756
Mmm.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.425
Do you want to get
a wine cooler?

20:58.458 --> 20:59.759
Sure.

20:59.792 --> 21:00.760
REBECCA: It's gonna be
 so perfect, Paula.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.829
We're gonna be on that hill

21:02.862 --> 21:05.798
under the rainbow of-of lights
and the sun setting,

21:05.832 --> 21:07.033
and I will read him that letter.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.368
(groans) That letter?

21:08.401 --> 21:09.502
Honey, we talked about this.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.571
And you understand what...

21:11.604 --> 21:13.740
Blowie Point is, right?

21:13.773 --> 21:14.974
Yes. Oh, my God.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.409
I have a windbreaker.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.844
And it has a hood.
Everyone's so worried

21:17.877 --> 21:18.945
about me in the wind.
Anyway,

21:18.978 --> 21:21.781
it's gonna be so beautiful,
because I really think

21:21.814 --> 21:25.385
all of the years of emotion
will just well up and...

21:25.418 --> 21:27.086
Speaking of welling up,
what's that on your chest?

21:27.119 --> 21:28.555
What? What are you
talking about?

21:28.588 --> 21:30.390
Um... it kind of looks like

21:30.423 --> 21:32.058
you're sporting a third nipple.

21:32.091 --> 21:34.427
Oh, my God.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.663
Oh, my... oh, my God,

21:36.696 --> 21:38.064
(Paula gasps)
it's the mosquitoes!

21:38.097 --> 21:40.433
You didn't use the bug spray
I packed for you?!

21:40.467 --> 21:42.702
Uh, that's not a sexy smell.

21:42.735 --> 21:45.472
You know, it's literally
intended to be repellent.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.440
You know what? This'll be fine.

21:47.474 --> 21:48.808
I'll put some concealer on this.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.743
That's what makeup's for.
Bing, bang, boom. Done.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.645
Babe, that doesn't look
like a regular bug bite.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.514
That looks like
an allergic reaction.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.516
You're not a doctor.
I have to go, okay?

21:56.549 --> 21:57.950
So, uh, bye.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.119
(quietly):
It's not... allergic.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.889
It's not an allergic... (sighs)

22:02.922 --> 22:04.757
(wheezing inhale)

22:04.791 --> 22:07.760
(wheezing): I can't breathe...

22:07.794 --> 22:08.895
my tongue's swelling...

22:10.863 --> 22:13.099
(wheezes)
Are you there, God?

22:13.132 --> 22:14.767
It's me.

22:21.073 --> 22:24.043
(distorted, echoing):
Wake up, honey. Wake up.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.078
Mm! What?

22:28.981 --> 22:30.717
Where am I?

22:30.750 --> 22:31.718
Am I in the matrix?

22:31.751 --> 22:33.553
Am I Neo?

22:34.454 --> 22:35.888
Am I Gretel? Where's Hansel?

22:35.922 --> 22:37.424
(whispers):
Did you eat him?

22:37.457 --> 22:39.459
You're in the medical center,
honey.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.461
You had a little incident.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.663
You went into
anaphylactic shock.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.433
(groans)
Ana... Oh, my God.

22:46.466 --> 22:49.469
Wait. Wait,
so how did I get here?

22:54.607 --> 22:56.576
Turns out,

22:56.609 --> 22:59.612
my dear, you are
allergic to mosquitoes.

22:59.646 --> 23:01.581
It's called skeeter syndrome.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.983
It's rare, but I saw it in Nam.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.818
Wow, you were in Nam?

23:05.852 --> 23:07.754
Last summer. It was great!

23:07.787 --> 23:09.656
I got a massage for two dollars.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.157
You should rest.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.025
You look like
a tornado survivor.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.094
(groaning)

23:15.127 --> 23:17.029
No, I can't rest.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.165
Oh, no, I can't rest.
I came here for one thing.

23:19.198 --> 23:21.534
Oh, the woman's
empowerment lecture.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.603
I'm looking forward to that.

23:23.636 --> 23:24.637
No, um, not that.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.773
I have to go make a boy
love me at Blowie Point.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.007
(grunting)

23:28.040 --> 23:30.009
You really should adjust
the way you talk

23:30.042 --> 23:32.111
about being in Nam--
it-it's quite confusing.

23:35.515 --> 23:36.215
(camera clicks)

23:36.248 --> 23:37.750
Hi.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.687
Hey. Working
on the perfect...

23:40.720 --> 23:42.622
selfie angle... Whoa.

23:42.655 --> 23:43.623
What happened to you?

23:43.656 --> 23:46.793
Oh, I'm just an allergic
bug tornado survivor.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.027
It's no big deal.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.662
That's why EpiPens
were invented.

23:49.696 --> 23:50.730
(laughs):
It's fine.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.064
You know,
maybe we should wait

23:52.098 --> 23:54.000
for the sun to go
down a little bit.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.035
Get a glow on our faces?

23:57.937 --> 24:01.073
That sounds great, yeah.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.676
Oh, let me, um...

24:05.077 --> 24:07.046
It's so funny
it's not windy at all up here.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.248
(chuckles)

24:09.281 --> 24:12.084
Oh, thank you.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.654
So, while we're waiting
for the sun to go down,

24:14.687 --> 24:16.022
I want to show you something.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.024
I was going through
some old stuff

24:18.057 --> 24:19.559
the other day,

24:19.592 --> 24:21.127
and I randomly came
across this old letter

24:21.160 --> 24:23.796
It's from our
Camp Canyon Grove...

24:23.830 --> 24:24.864
Oh!
days, yeah.

24:24.897 --> 24:25.698
And I was like,
"Oh, my God,

24:25.732 --> 24:27.600
I have to show Josh
this letter."

24:27.634 --> 24:29.902
So, do you,
do you want me to read it?

24:29.936 --> 24:31.203
Uh, okay.

24:32.672 --> 24:33.706
Great, it--

24:33.740 --> 24:35.742
Okay, cool.

24:37.109 --> 24:40.880
* Dear Joshua Felix Chan

24:40.913 --> 24:45.552
* I remember
the moment it began *

24:45.585 --> 24:47.820
* You were playing Frisbee
shirtless *

24:47.854 --> 24:51.558
* On the field across the lake
next to the Dumpster *

24:51.591 --> 24:53.693
* And your skin glistened
in the sunlight *

24:53.726 --> 24:56.696
* All your moles,
a constellation on your chest *

24:59.732 --> 25:03.202
* Dear Joshua,
when we frolic *

25:03.235 --> 25:07.907
* I feel like,
and not to be hyperbolic *

25:07.940 --> 25:10.242
* But I feel like
I could die of happiness *

25:10.276 --> 25:13.012
* When I'm nestled
in your hairless arms *

25:13.045 --> 25:14.714
* We're like
Tristan and Isolde *

25:14.747 --> 25:16.783
* Ancient lovers rotting
desperately in the forest... *

25:16.816 --> 25:18.718
(snickering)

25:18.751 --> 25:20.152
(dog barks in the distance)

25:20.186 --> 25:22.121
So, oh, oh,

25:22.154 --> 25:24.256
do you think it's funny?

25:24.290 --> 25:25.324
(laughs):
Yeah!

25:25.357 --> 25:26.626
Totally, right?

25:26.659 --> 25:29.095
16-year-olds
are absurd!

25:29.128 --> 25:30.262
I was a total

25:30.296 --> 25:31.664
doofus back then.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.266
And you were so dramatic
and, like, weird.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.269
I mean,
"rotting in the forest"?

25:37.303 --> 25:39.138
Like, what? (laughing)

25:39.171 --> 25:40.807
That's so weird!
Yeah.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.042
That's why I
showed it to you.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.877
That's why I showed
it to you, totally.

25:44.911 --> 25:47.614
And, yeah, I'm so glad
I'm not like this anymore.

25:47.647 --> 25:48.881
Come on, um,

25:48.915 --> 25:50.349
read-read
the rest of it.
Oh--

25:50.382 --> 25:51.751
What else does it say?

25:51.784 --> 25:53.219
Oh, it's like, the
rest of it's like,

25:53.252 --> 25:55.254
more of, like, the
same stupid, like,

25:55.287 --> 25:57.690
like, blah, blah, blah,
you know, Corn Pops.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.659
And yada yada,
fudgsicles

25:59.692 --> 26:01.360
and fireflies--
I mean, it's nothing.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.762
Can we take the selfie?

26:02.795 --> 26:03.963
I think the sun's perfect.
Oh, yeah.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.632
Oh, okay.
Okay.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.934
#SuperFunnyLetter.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.238
Yeah. Uh, cool.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.673
I got to go
empower some women.

26:13.706 --> 26:15.041
Okay.

26:23.650 --> 26:26.152
(indistinct chatter)

26:28.387 --> 26:30.823
Don't touch me.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.892
Why do we have
to do this again?

26:32.925 --> 26:34.193
(scoffs)
Mandatory, remember?

26:34.226 --> 26:36.696
(girl shushes)

26:36.729 --> 26:38.064
(chattering stops)

26:38.097 --> 26:39.165
Whoa.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.200
Hot mess alert! (laughs)

26:42.802 --> 26:44.236
(girls gasping)

26:45.404 --> 26:46.773
Gross.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.008
GIRL 2:
What happened to her?

26:49.041 --> 26:50.943
(clears throat)

26:50.977 --> 26:54.781
The word ovary
derives from the Latin oophor,

26:54.814 --> 26:57.784
which means "to bear."

26:57.817 --> 26:58.918
What's Latin
for "stupid"?

26:58.951 --> 27:01.187
(laughter)

27:02.855 --> 27:04.991
And what a heavy burden we bear

27:05.024 --> 27:07.927
as the women
in contemporary society.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.862
We are like oxen

27:09.896 --> 27:11.230
strapped to the yolk

27:11.263 --> 27:12.665
of the patriarchy...

27:12.699 --> 27:14.266
(girls mooing)

27:14.300 --> 27:16.035
That's not oxen.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.069
That's a cow.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.805
(laughter)

27:18.838 --> 27:21.841
And together as sisters,
we must pull the cart

27:21.874 --> 27:23.275
of feminism to--

27:23.309 --> 27:25.277
Is that a tampon?

27:26.879 --> 27:28.948
(crying):
Why are you so mean to me?

27:28.981 --> 27:31.083
(laughter continues)

27:31.117 --> 27:33.385
I have had the worst day.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.387
And I feel so sad

27:35.421 --> 27:37.990
and small right now.

27:38.024 --> 27:39.291
(laughter stops)

27:39.325 --> 27:42.194
Just leave me alone...

27:44.897 --> 27:46.766
Are you okay, Cabbage Patch?

27:46.799 --> 27:49.201
Why doesn't he love me?!

27:52.939 --> 27:53.906
Whoa.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.141
That bitch is thirsty.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.149
(sobbing):
I'm sorry.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.117
I shouldn't be here.

28:05.151 --> 28:08.921
I'm not one to speak
about feminism or empowerment.

28:08.955 --> 28:11.824
I am desperately in love
with a man

28:11.858 --> 28:14.727
who will never love me back.

28:16.262 --> 28:19.031
I'm the one
who needs to be empowered.

28:19.065 --> 28:21.067
(crying)

28:24.336 --> 28:26.372
(sniffling)

28:26.405 --> 28:29.108
Don't worry.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.912
We'll empower you up.

28:32.945 --> 28:35.114
What?

28:36.849 --> 28:38.084
GREG:
 I can't believe

28:38.117 --> 28:39.218
we ran into each other.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.319
I know.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.088
So, you're-you're
an actress now.

28:42.121 --> 28:43.890
Right, I Goog--
I read about that,

28:43.923 --> 28:45.424
I think in the, uh, uh,

28:45.457 --> 28:47.293
student, uh, newsletter.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.928
Yeah, well, I'm trying,

28:48.961 --> 28:50.797
but it's not going very well.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.064
Oh, come on.

28:52.098 --> 28:53.499
You were in Bones.

28:53.532 --> 28:55.768
I played a dead barista.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.904
And you didn't move once.

28:57.937 --> 28:58.838
(chuckles)

28:58.871 --> 29:00.206
You had coffee all over you.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.240
Was that hot?

29:01.273 --> 29:02.975
Uh, it wasn't real coffee.

29:03.009 --> 29:04.143
I was jok-- It's okay.

29:04.176 --> 29:05.411
Oh.
(both laughing)

29:05.444 --> 29:08.014
See?
See?

29:08.047 --> 29:09.816
I bought it, kind of.
Oh...

29:09.849 --> 29:12.819
Oh, this is why I should've been
talking to you in high school,

29:12.852 --> 29:15.321
instead of talking
to jerks and dumb jocks.

29:15.354 --> 29:16.355
It's okay.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.090
That was their time.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.358
Now they're doing time.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.360
(laughs) Hey-o!
Ah!

29:21.393 --> 29:23.329
(crying):
...we'd meet at sundown,

29:23.362 --> 29:26.465
and so I reading letter,
and he laughing at me

29:26.498 --> 29:29.368
and I saying,
"Corn Pops, blah, blah, blah,"

29:29.401 --> 29:32.438
but I meaning you just
broke my heart again!

29:32.471 --> 29:34.506
God, that reminds me
so much of Jaden.

29:34.540 --> 29:35.942
Mm.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.043
I was super into this guy.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.077
And he was only using me

29:38.110 --> 29:39.445
for my discount
at the taco place.

29:39.478 --> 29:42.081
At least you have a crush
on a guy like Josh.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.315
I mean, most of the guys
I go out with,

29:43.349 --> 29:46.585
they just send over a dirty pic
with a text that says "WYD."

29:46.618 --> 29:48.120
BOTH:
Mm.

29:48.154 --> 29:50.056
Why is Yanni dancing?

29:50.089 --> 29:51.557
What does that mean?

29:51.590 --> 29:53.225
Why is that pertinent?

29:53.259 --> 29:54.226
No.
No, no, no.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.995
What you doing?
Oh.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.563
It's like, if you can't
even type out a word,

29:57.596 --> 29:59.331
I'm not gonna
take my clothes off.
Mm.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.067
At least send an emoji.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.334
Like the chipmunk

30:02.368 --> 30:03.903
eating the block of cheese?

30:03.936 --> 30:05.137
I get that.
I'm coming over.

30:05.171 --> 30:06.405
No questions asked.

30:06.438 --> 30:07.874
Ladies, I don't know what to do.

30:07.907 --> 30:10.542
I have tried everything
to get Josh's attention

30:10.576 --> 30:12.211
and get him to love me,
but it-it's like,

30:12.244 --> 30:13.379
he doesn't even see me.

30:13.412 --> 30:14.413
Boys are tough.

30:14.446 --> 30:15.514
Life's tough.

30:15.547 --> 30:18.117
I taught myself to read
while I was locked in a box.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.418
Like, in jail?

30:19.451 --> 30:20.419
No.

30:20.452 --> 30:21.988
An actual box.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.022
Whoa.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.290
And in that box,

30:24.323 --> 30:26.292
I learned to never
put a man first.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.894
Or he'll lock you in the box.

30:27.927 --> 30:28.961
My God.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.429
I also learned
it's not a bad idea

30:30.462 --> 30:31.964
to keep almonds in your pocket
at all times

30:31.998 --> 30:34.867
in case of emergencies.

30:34.901 --> 30:35.701
Want one?

30:35.734 --> 30:37.904
Yeah, I am a little hungry,
thanks.

30:37.937 --> 30:40.472
See, but that is the one thing
a girl needs to teach herself

30:40.506 --> 30:42.474
over and over and over again.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.176
Never put a man first.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.278
Mm-mm.
Put yourself first.

30:46.312 --> 30:47.113
You're totally right.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.547
Like, I should read
Gloria Steinem

30:48.580 --> 30:50.182
and take a ceramics class

30:50.216 --> 30:51.383
and grow my pit hair out,
you know?

30:51.417 --> 30:52.418
It's like, stuff like that--

30:52.451 --> 30:53.652
ALL:
No.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.454
What you need
is a makeover.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.189
(dance music playing)

31:05.231 --> 31:07.266
* Put yourself first, girl,
worry about yourself *

31:07.299 --> 31:09.936
* Make yourself sexy
just for yourself *

31:09.969 --> 31:12.071
* So when dudes see
you put yourself first *

31:12.104 --> 31:14.406
* They'll be like, "Damn you're
hot-- want to make out?" *

31:14.440 --> 31:16.475
* Push them boobs up
just for yourself *

31:16.508 --> 31:19.078
* Wear six-inch heels
just for yourself *

31:19.111 --> 31:21.213
If it's just for myself,
shouldn't I be comfortable?

31:21.247 --> 31:24.250
* No, put yourself first
in a sexy way *

31:24.283 --> 31:26.485
* Pierce your ears
just for yourself *

31:26.518 --> 31:29.088
* Put a hole in your earlobe
just for yourself *

31:29.121 --> 31:31.223
* Brace yourself,
this is gonna hurt *

31:31.257 --> 31:32.324
* Put yourself first
in a sexy way... *

31:32.358 --> 31:34.226
(Rebecca screams)

31:34.260 --> 31:35.962
* Put yourself first, girl,
worry about yourself *

31:35.995 --> 31:38.597
* Wear fake eyelids
just for yourself *

31:38.630 --> 31:40.399
* So when dudes see you
put yourself first *

31:40.432 --> 31:42.001
* They'll be like--
Damn, you're hot *

31:42.034 --> 31:43.502
* Let's buy a house
in Portland *

31:43.535 --> 31:45.271
* Put yourself first for him

31:45.304 --> 31:48.374
* That's what you got to do

31:48.407 --> 31:50.276
* Put yourself first for him

31:50.309 --> 31:52.011
If I put myself first for him,

31:52.044 --> 31:55.414
then, by definition,
aren't I putting myself second?

31:55.447 --> 31:57.416
* Don't think about it too hard,
too, too hard *

31:57.449 --> 31:59.651
* Don't think about it
too hard, too, too hard *

31:59.685 --> 32:01.253
* It's a wormhole

32:01.287 --> 32:02.521
* It's a Mobius strip

32:02.554 --> 32:03.555
* It's snake eats tail

32:03.589 --> 32:05.224
* It's the infinity sign

32:05.257 --> 32:07.293
* Get a tattoo
of the infinity sign *

32:07.326 --> 32:08.560
* On your lower back

32:08.594 --> 32:09.728
* Just for yourself

32:09.761 --> 32:11.230
But I can't see my lower back.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.966
Also, can we go back
to the fake eyelid?

32:14.000 --> 32:15.501
Is that a thing now?

32:15.534 --> 32:16.602
ALL: Yes.

32:16.635 --> 32:19.038
* Put yourself first
in a sexy way *

32:19.071 --> 32:21.073
* Put yourself first for him.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.310
Thank you, sisters.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.045
I feel so much better now.

32:26.078 --> 32:27.980
(chuckling)

32:28.014 --> 32:29.982
Girls got to look
out for each other.

32:30.016 --> 32:31.250
Mm-hmm.
We got it.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.251
Oh, my God.

32:32.284 --> 32:33.385
Look who it is.

32:33.419 --> 32:35.021
Hey, girls.

32:35.054 --> 32:37.589
Wow, Becks, you look cool.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.725
You're all
"Becky from the block."

32:39.758 --> 32:41.493
(laughs awkwardly)
That's funny.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.529
JOSH:
Uh.

32:43.562 --> 32:46.732
Hey, uh, can I talk
to you for a sec, alone?

32:48.100 --> 32:52.204
Um, you know, like,
when I have time.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.673
Okay, uh, let me know.

32:54.706 --> 32:56.142
But now, now's good.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.509
I'm-I'm not doing anything now.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.145
So now's super-good.

32:59.178 --> 33:00.412
I don't have
anything going on.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.414
Now.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.754
I'm taking a hip-hop
class at my church.
Mmm.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.489
It's called "Grooves."
Oh, yeah?

33:10.522 --> 33:11.757
Hey, hey, daddy longlegs.

33:11.790 --> 33:13.225
Want to put a coaster
under that thing?

33:13.259 --> 33:15.494
Ma'am? Ma'am?
Sophistic8ted, I think not.

33:15.527 --> 33:16.495
You know,
actually, can...?

33:16.528 --> 33:17.329
I have an announcement to make.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.231
Can we just watch
the veneer, ladies?

33:19.265 --> 33:22.501
It's... not that...
you know, not that difficult.

33:22.534 --> 33:23.502
Geez Louise.

33:23.535 --> 33:24.770
Thank you.

33:24.803 --> 33:27.239
* They all wanna be,
wanna be me... *

33:27.273 --> 33:29.275
*

33:36.148 --> 33:37.749
I'm so bummed. I have to go.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.251
(chuckles)

33:39.285 --> 33:41.420
But you have my number now,
so text me, okay?

33:41.453 --> 33:43.689
Yes.
I'd really like
to see you again.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.691
Me too. That would be great.

33:45.724 --> 33:48.427
You're such a
down-to-earth guy,

33:48.460 --> 33:50.362
not like the
douche bags in L.A.

33:50.396 --> 33:51.430
(chuckles)

33:51.463 --> 33:53.432
I feel like

33:53.465 --> 33:56.168
you're the kind of person
a girl could really...

33:56.202 --> 33:58.770
settle down with someday.

34:00.606 --> 34:01.840
What?

34:01.873 --> 34:04.576
JOSH: Becks, I couldn't
stop thinking about it,

34:04.610 --> 34:06.578
and I went back up
to Blowie Point.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.847
So I found your letter.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.581
Oh, my God.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.451
Oh, you didn't read the
whole thing, did you?

34:18.757 --> 34:21.193
(snickers)

34:21.226 --> 34:23.195
Tristan and who?

34:23.228 --> 34:24.463
(snickers)

34:24.496 --> 34:29.201
REBECCA:
* Dear Joshua Felix Chan

34:29.235 --> 34:33.472
* It's music
when I hold your hand *

34:33.505 --> 34:36.208
* I loved you from the moment
that I saw you *

34:36.242 --> 34:39.478
* You're my hero,
I believe in you *

34:39.511 --> 34:41.746
* There's nothing you can't do

34:41.780 --> 34:45.217
* You make a difference
in the world *

34:45.251 --> 34:49.487
* And you make all the
difference in the world *

34:49.521 --> 34:52.791
* To... me....

34:54.926 --> 34:57.896
Oh, my God, Josh,
I... (laughs)

34:57.929 --> 35:00.299
I told you,
when I was that age,

35:00.332 --> 35:03.302
I was really dramatic and weird,
and I was so hormonal,

35:03.335 --> 35:04.570
so whatever I said
in this letter...

35:04.603 --> 35:06.705
Rebecca, what you said

35:06.738 --> 35:09.441
about believing in me, about...

35:09.475 --> 35:12.378
truly understanding who I am,

35:12.411 --> 35:16.148
no one has ever said
anything like that about me.

35:20.919 --> 35:23.622
Do you mind if I keep it?

35:23.655 --> 35:26.358
Not at all. Please.

35:26.392 --> 35:28.927
Cool.

35:28.960 --> 35:32.398
You know, all my life, I've
wondered if I was good enough

35:32.431 --> 35:36.402
or smart enough,

35:36.435 --> 35:39.938
but now I know
you've always believed in me.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.808
You always support me
in who I am.

35:42.841 --> 35:45.277
Getting me hired at Aloha's

35:45.311 --> 35:47.579
and coming to this camp.

35:47.613 --> 35:49.915
I love this camp.

35:54.220 --> 35:58.257
You never tried to change me.

35:58.290 --> 36:00.259
That means so much.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.827
You have no idea.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.699
It's ironic.

36:07.733 --> 36:09.435
You came here
to empower some girls,

36:09.468 --> 36:12.838
but instead you empowered
this goofball.

36:12.871 --> 36:15.607
(both chuckle)

36:37.629 --> 36:39.365
See you later, Becks.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.304
Bye.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.838
What the hell?

36:46.872 --> 36:48.907
You're a grown-ass woman.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.476
He should have been
kissing you on your mouth.

36:50.509 --> 36:52.478
Yeah, she's still
thirsty, Josh.

36:52.511 --> 36:55.647
Uh-uh,
I'm not thirsty anymore, Tanya.

36:57.283 --> 36:59.485
Right now,

36:59.518 --> 37:01.520
in this moment...

37:01.553 --> 37:03.889
(sighs)
I feel quenched.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.957
Gross.

37:10.462 --> 37:13.699
I'm, uh, I'm not ready
to say good-bye to this pâté.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.867
You mind if I take some with me?
Absolutely.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.002
Hey, you know what,

37:17.035 --> 37:18.770
you don't have to stick around
and help me clean up.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.672
Honestly, I mean, everybody
else has already bailed.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.408
Oh, no, no, it's cool, bro.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.676
I was also the social director
of my fraternity,

37:24.710 --> 37:27.546
so I also know that everyone
leaves you with a wet bathroom.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.381
How does it get so wet?

37:29.415 --> 37:31.550
No one knows.
(laughs)

37:31.583 --> 37:34.653
Hey, you know why I really
wanted to have a party?

37:34.686 --> 37:35.687
Huh?

37:35.721 --> 37:37.423
Well, it's just...

37:37.456 --> 37:39.691
like, it's really tough on me
when my daughter isn't around.

37:39.725 --> 37:40.959
I get a little sad.

37:40.992 --> 37:44.563
Just wanted to be
a little less... lonely,

37:44.596 --> 37:45.831
make some friends.

37:45.864 --> 37:48.967
Well, you made one.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.702
That girl with the tube top?

37:50.736 --> 37:52.438
No, I... I paid for her.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.506
I paid for all the
girls, actually.

37:54.540 --> 37:55.741
Uh...

37:55.774 --> 37:58.344
Oh, I'm sorry, you mean you.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.879
Yeah, yeah, that's...
(chuckles) that's what I meant.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.614
Oh, thank you.

38:02.648 --> 38:03.915
All right, I better jet.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.353
All right.
There you go.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.020
Yeah. Yeah.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.361
Later, bro.

38:15.394 --> 38:17.396
*

38:21.467 --> 38:23.001
Oof.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.608
*

38:37.816 --> 38:39.785
My health insurance
doesn't cover therapy,

38:39.818 --> 38:41.520
so I'm stuck with this.

38:41.553 --> 38:44.523
But it was in the library's free
book bin, so you know it's good.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.792
There is a dead spider
sticking out of the binding.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.060
So far it's been really fun.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.929
I've learned a lot

38:50.962 --> 38:54.800
about being emotionally naked.

38:54.833 --> 38:58.904
Ew. Throw on
an emotional robe, please.

38:58.937 --> 39:02.040
Heather, seriously, I'm sorry.

39:02.073 --> 39:05.043
If someone even hints
about being exclusive,

39:05.076 --> 39:07.045
I get nervous that
they're gonna bail.

39:07.078 --> 39:10.616
And according to this book,
it's because I am a...

39:10.649 --> 39:12.684
"dumbass."

39:12.718 --> 39:13.952
That's cool.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.687
You are who you are.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.956
So... bye.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.625
Uh, where are you going?

39:19.658 --> 39:21.493
I get real for one minute,
and you're out?

39:21.527 --> 39:24.362
Sorry, it's just
that I have a date.

39:26.732 --> 39:28.434
Is it Zeke?

39:28.467 --> 39:29.701
I drunk-Googled him.

39:30.602 --> 39:31.570
I get it.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.439
The abs, the tats, it works.

39:33.472 --> 39:34.440
No.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.975
Uh, the movie starts at 7:00.

39:37.008 --> 39:39.445
The date is with you, dummy.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.513
I was, like,
trying to do a cute thing.

39:41.547 --> 39:44.783
Again, s...
(laughs) so subtle.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.785
I... I'm in.

39:46.818 --> 39:49.621
I commit to this movie.

39:49.655 --> 39:51.156
Okay.

39:51.189 --> 39:54.460
But if we do this again,
you can't be an idiot this time.

39:54.493 --> 39:56.462
Never again.

39:56.495 --> 39:57.596
Come on, let's go.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.598
No, no, no, no, no, no.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.470
You need this.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.037
Yes, I do.

40:07.506 --> 40:08.874
(sighs)

40:14.980 --> 40:16.782
(door opens)

40:16.815 --> 40:18.517
How was your last trip to camp?

40:18.550 --> 40:20.051
Was it sad to say good-bye?

40:20.085 --> 40:21.553
I don't know...

40:24.723 --> 40:26.224
...'cause I didn't.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.493
Excuse me?

40:27.526 --> 40:29.495
I'm going back every year.

40:29.528 --> 40:30.496
It's who I am.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.498
It's important to me.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.533
I can't believe
you're talking to me like this.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.535
It's called empowerment.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.174
(humming)

40:43.208 --> 40:47.178
You know, they say you
can't go back in time.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.180
But "they" are dumb.

40:49.214 --> 40:51.517
'Cause you totally can.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.519
That trip to camp was a triumph.

40:53.552 --> 40:56.788
I mean, it wasn't just
a victory, it was a mandate.

40:56.822 --> 40:58.056
Like, you could invade

40:58.089 --> 41:00.058
any country
that you wanted to right now,

41:00.091 --> 41:01.693
because...

41:01.727 --> 41:03.529
he kissed you.

41:03.562 --> 41:06.097
I mean, he didn't kiss me,
he just kissed me on the cheek.

41:06.131 --> 41:07.833
Um, it's the way
that he kissed you.

41:07.866 --> 41:11.202
And listen to me,
a kiss on the cheek means...

41:11.236 --> 41:12.704
What does it mean?

41:13.705 --> 41:14.673
What does it mean?

41:14.706 --> 41:15.707
What-what does it mean?

41:17.776 --> 41:21.046
Well, sometimes
it means nothing.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.548
Mmm.

41:22.581 --> 41:23.815
Uh, sometimes it means
it's your Aunt Lucy,

41:23.849 --> 41:25.283
and she hasn't seen you
since you were 11,

41:25.316 --> 41:26.952
but sometimes...

41:26.985 --> 41:29.855
sometimes it means...

41:31.823 --> 41:34.793
...everything.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.828
It does?
It does?

41:40.065 --> 41:41.066
(both sigh)

41:46.071 --> 41:47.773
(banging)
MAN: Come on, Chloe.

41:47.806 --> 41:49.307
Let me out of the box.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.375
Say it again.

41:50.408 --> 41:53.311
MAN: Female wage disparity
needs to be rectified

41:53.344 --> 41:55.113
through congressional action.

41:55.146 --> 41:56.615
Good boy.

41:58.016 --> 42:01.186
MAN: Ugh, that was worth
at least three almonds.
