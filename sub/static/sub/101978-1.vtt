WEBVTT

01:53.673 --> 01:57.376
She was a strict mama.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.279
But she was fair.

02:04.517 --> 02:06.418
You know, whenever we was
in trouble as boys,

02:06.452 --> 02:08.588
she would always...

02:30.510 --> 02:33.245
Well, that's interestin'.

02:43.355 --> 02:45.157
I'm sure it's nothing.

03:25.898 --> 03:28.668
Steven?

03:28.701 --> 03:30.903
I think someone's out here.

03:30.937 --> 03:33.473
What?

03:33.506 --> 03:35.541
Someone's out here!

03:35.575 --> 03:37.877
I can't hear you.

03:37.910 --> 03:39.411
Behind you!

04:07.974 --> 04:09.776
Oh my God.

04:09.809 --> 04:12.310
Steven!

04:12.344 --> 04:13.880
Get up!

04:16.783 --> 04:18.250
Get up!

04:56.022 --> 04:57.890
Well, well, well.

05:01.828 --> 05:05.263
Looks like Christmas came early
this year, hmm?

05:14.006 --> 05:16.341
I know what you're thinkin'.

05:16.374 --> 05:18.410
You're thinkin' I heard about
this sort of thing happenin',

05:18.444 --> 05:20.312
but I didn't think it would
happen to little old me.

05:21.714 --> 05:23.850
Well, it has.

05:23.883 --> 05:25.952
But you're gonna be famous.

05:25.985 --> 05:29.489
You're gonna be on one of those
missing persons posters.

05:29.522 --> 05:32.959
When they send it out,
I'm puttin' it in my window.

05:32.992 --> 05:36.662
Not of your boyfriend,
'cause he dead.

05:36.696 --> 05:42.001
But you, I'm keepin' you alive.

05:42.034 --> 05:45.438
I got plans for you.

05:45.471 --> 05:48.908
And thusly, you and I should
get intimately acquainted.

05:48.941 --> 05:50.843
Don't you think, hmm?

05:53.012 --> 05:56.949
Excuse my hands,
I know they're cold, hmm?

05:58.684 --> 05:59.952
You know what I'm lookin' for,
huh?

06:03.556 --> 06:04.891
Found it.

06:08.928 --> 06:10.362
I'm impressed.

06:10.395 --> 06:14.399
Most girls, they try scream,
panic.

06:14.433 --> 06:16.502
Not you.

06:18.938 --> 06:20.940
Celeste.

06:20.973 --> 06:23.976
Huh, what a beautiful name.

06:24.010 --> 06:27.947
What a great picture.

06:27.980 --> 06:29.347
I'm Owen.

06:29.381 --> 06:31.383
You already met
my brother Oswald.

06:37.590 --> 06:39.826
Quiet.

06:39.859 --> 06:44.764
A quiet celestial being, hmm?

06:44.797 --> 06:47.533
I like that.

06:47.567 --> 06:48.968
It's good.

06:49.001 --> 06:53.539
It's real good.

06:53.573 --> 06:54.907
'Cause around here...

06:55.842 --> 06:58.778
Silence is golden.

07:02.148 --> 07:05.651
But I really mean that.

07:05.685 --> 07:09.088
You keep that tongue
inside your head.

07:09.121 --> 07:12.558
You use it, you lose it.

07:18.130 --> 07:20.466
You know what you
should be doin'.

07:20.499 --> 07:22.435
Go on!

07:23.903 --> 07:26.038
I hate
to leave you hangin' here,

07:29.208 --> 07:32.645
but I got work to do.

10:10.970 --> 10:13.906
You want to lay down?

11:01.420 --> 11:04.990
So tell us what
it's like to be 25?

11:05.024 --> 11:06.125
Why?

11:06.158 --> 11:09.261
So you can look back
at this when you're 50.

11:09.295 --> 11:10.930
Like she's gonna care.

11:10.963 --> 11:12.198
Of course, she's gonna care.

11:12.231 --> 11:13.666
25 years from now everyone's

11:13.699 --> 11:16.302
gonna be filming
everything they do, okay?

11:16.335 --> 11:18.404
Trust me.

11:18.438 --> 11:20.106
Why?

11:20.139 --> 11:21.774
Are they gonna be
as bored as you?

11:28.180 --> 11:30.683
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

11:38.324 --> 11:39.692
Fuck!

11:52.905 --> 11:55.040
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

11:55.074 --> 11:56.909
Jesus!

12:07.186 --> 12:07.987
What is it?

12:08.020 --> 12:08.687
It's the fuckin' rad...

12:08.721 --> 12:11.190
Get that thing out of my face.

12:11.223 --> 12:12.825
Fuck.

12:18.998 --> 12:20.366
What's going on?

12:20.399 --> 12:22.301
It's the radiator, I think.

12:22.334 --> 12:24.236
Alright,
just what we fuckin' need.

12:42.888 --> 12:43.889
I'm gonna walk.

12:43.923 --> 12:45.291
Pretty sure there's
a gas station up the road

12:45.324 --> 12:47.193
a few miles.

12:47.226 --> 12:49.128
Do you wanna walk with me?

12:49.161 --> 12:50.430
Do you need me to walk with you?

12:56.503 --> 12:59.338
Whoa, where you goin'?

12:59.371 --> 13:01.173
There's a gas station up
that way.

13:01.207 --> 13:03.443
If they can't fix the car,
at least, they'll have a phone.

13:11.050 --> 13:14.253
Okay, what's goin' on?

13:14.286 --> 13:16.155
What happened last night?

13:16.188 --> 13:19.158
Mm, it's not just last night.

13:19.191 --> 13:20.359
He's been lying about
where he's been

13:20.392 --> 13:21.827
the past few weeks.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.729
Some other chick?

13:27.467 --> 13:29.368
Uh, I don't know.

13:29.401 --> 13:31.337
All I know is I bring it up,
he shuts me down.

13:34.106 --> 13:35.975
I just wanna go home.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.549
Alright, then, I'll...

13:42.582 --> 13:45.317
I'll go with him,
make sure he gets done quick.

13:45.351 --> 13:46.785
Okay.

13:53.025 --> 13:57.096
Taylor, where you goin'?

13:57.129 --> 13:58.797
To help Mike.

13:58.831 --> 14:00.266
Don't go worrying about me.

14:01.501 --> 14:05.104
And let go off
of the fucking camera.

14:42.975 --> 14:48.247
♪ It's alright,
don't you worry ♪

14:48.280 --> 14:51.551
♪ It's alright, don't you cry ♪

14:54.386 --> 14:57.356
♪ It's alright,
don't you worry ♪

14:59.925 --> 15:02.227
♪ Because mama's still alive ♪

15:09.301 --> 15:11.170
Hey.

15:13.238 --> 15:14.073
What are you doing?

15:14.106 --> 15:15.475
Comin' with you.

15:15.508 --> 15:16.942
Why?

15:16.975 --> 15:20.112
'Cause I want to.

15:20.145 --> 15:21.313
It's just me.

15:21.347 --> 15:23.550
I told Chris to hang back
with Jenna.

15:23.583 --> 15:25.552
I told her
there'd be no time wasted.

15:42.401 --> 15:46.606
Hey, we got shit tickets
if we need 'em.

15:46.639 --> 15:47.640
What?

15:47.674 --> 15:49.642
Shit tickets.

15:49.676 --> 15:51.977
It's better than using leaves.

15:56.583 --> 15:59.184
How far out do you think we are?

15:59.218 --> 16:00.119
From home?

16:00.152 --> 16:02.287
Yeah.

16:02.321 --> 16:04.990
About 100 miles.

16:05.023 --> 16:06.593
How long to walk that?

16:09.161 --> 16:11.464
3 miles an hour.

16:11.498 --> 16:13.298
About 33 hours.

16:13.332 --> 16:15.033
It's like a day and a half?

16:15.067 --> 16:17.336
Without sleep, yeah.

16:17.369 --> 16:19.405
No wonder I never go anywhere.

16:19.439 --> 16:22.307
Yeah, well, we should have
stayed home last night.

16:22.341 --> 16:24.410
You really didn't have
a good time?

16:24.444 --> 16:25.678
For a guy who likes
to videotape people

16:25.712 --> 16:28.515
at every moment,
you're not very observant.

16:28.548 --> 16:30.983
Oh, you can stay here.

16:31.016 --> 16:33.720
But what if something happens
to you?

16:33.753 --> 16:35.220
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

16:35.254 --> 16:36.656
But what if it does?

16:36.689 --> 16:39.324
Then you'll be wiping your ass
with leaves.

17:31.578 --> 17:36.181
Mike, your eyeballs are
burning holes into my pockets.

17:36.215 --> 17:39.218
You sure Jenna's not coming.

17:39.251 --> 17:42.187
She doesn't wanna talk to you.

17:42.221 --> 17:43.490
She knows you're lying to her.

17:43.523 --> 17:44.591
She said that?

17:44.624 --> 17:46.493
Mmhmm.

17:48.126 --> 17:49.161
What do you think?

17:53.733 --> 17:58.605
What I think is
that your relationship's over.

17:58.638 --> 18:00.707
Has been for a while.

18:10.650 --> 18:13.686
So how far away
is this gas station?

18:13.720 --> 18:16.456
I don't know,
another half hour or so.

18:19.324 --> 18:21.260
Good.

18:29.802 --> 18:31.738
And pull out this time,
last time you didn't.

18:35.374 --> 18:36.576
What the fuck was that?

18:36.609 --> 18:37.544
What was what?

18:37.577 --> 18:38.110
I don't know.

18:38.143 --> 18:41.246
Didn't you hear that?

18:41.280 --> 18:42.615
Wait, you think they're coming?

18:45.451 --> 18:46.753
Shit.

18:59.666 --> 19:01.668
I told you they're not coming.

19:01.701 --> 19:03.870
Neither are we, apparently.

19:03.903 --> 19:05.638
Let's just get to someone
who has a phone

19:05.672 --> 19:07.540
and who can fix my car.

20:03.796 --> 20:06.566
Good times.

20:06.599 --> 20:08.400
It's weird.

20:08.434 --> 20:12.772
I tripped over a wire
and I found blood on a tree.

20:12.805 --> 20:14.741
So?

20:14.774 --> 20:18.444
It was a handprint.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.647
A hunter
could have gone hunting,

20:20.680 --> 20:22.815
killed a deer,
got some blood on his hands,

20:22.849 --> 20:24.717
and just wiped it on the tree.

20:27.920 --> 20:28.888
It's not hunting season.

20:49.408 --> 20:52.545
Aren't you worried
that he's gonna find out?

20:52.578 --> 20:53.546
If I were you,

20:53.579 --> 20:55.448
I'd be more worried
about Jenna finding out.

20:55.481 --> 20:56.616
Yeah, but I'm not the one

20:56.649 --> 20:58.350
who's supposed
to be her best friend.

20:58.383 --> 20:59.418
I'm not her best friend.

20:59.452 --> 21:00.453
Come on, Taylor,
you're the only girl

21:00.486 --> 21:02.689
she brought with her
on her 25th birthday trip.

21:02.722 --> 21:05.792
Well, she's not my best friend.

21:05.825 --> 21:07.694
Yeah, obviously not.

21:07.727 --> 21:09.729
I wouldn't worry about it.

21:09.762 --> 21:13.499
She finds out, she'll just
blame me and stay with you.

21:13.533 --> 21:14.734
Yeah, right.

21:14.767 --> 21:17.235
Yeah, right.

21:17.269 --> 21:18.971
That's what girls do.

21:39.424 --> 21:40.460
Did you find it?

21:40.493 --> 21:42.495
Yeah.

21:42.528 --> 21:43.963
And?

21:43.996 --> 21:45.932
I'll give it to you.

21:45.965 --> 21:48.601
It's fuckin' weird,
but whatever.

21:52.304 --> 21:54.607
You know, if it makes you feel
any better.

21:54.640 --> 21:57.744
I didn't have a really good time
last night either.

21:57.777 --> 22:01.481
I'm just saying it wasn't all
like woo-hoo for everyone there

22:01.514 --> 22:03.716
except for you.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.618
That doesn't help, Chris.

22:07.553 --> 22:09.455
Well, what happened?

22:09.489 --> 22:11.356
Maybe I can help.

22:18.731 --> 22:21.501
Life.

22:21.534 --> 22:22.802
Life happened.

23:13.052 --> 23:16.455
This place?

23:16.489 --> 23:17.957
Yeah.

23:17.990 --> 23:20.693
Looks ancient

23:20.726 --> 23:22.662
So what?

23:22.695 --> 23:24.329
Let's go.

23:31.671 --> 23:35.741
Hello?

23:35.775 --> 23:37.877
I'm sure they're just
in the back.

23:48.788 --> 23:51.123
Hello?

23:51.157 --> 23:52.792
Hello?

23:54.694 --> 23:55.561
Hello?

23:55.595 --> 23:57.897
Mornin'.

23:57.930 --> 24:00.800
Morning.

24:00.833 --> 24:03.002
Can I help you with somethin'?

24:03.035 --> 24:07.540
Yeah, car broke down
about 45 minutes back that way.

24:07.573 --> 24:08.808
Out of gas?

24:08.841 --> 24:11.844
No, the radiator's busted.

24:11.878 --> 24:12.678
Ouch!

24:13.980 --> 24:16.015
Ooh!

24:17.750 --> 24:19.485
Where you headed?

24:19.518 --> 24:22.054
Back to Spencerville.

24:22.088 --> 24:24.123
You live there?

24:24.156 --> 24:26.525
Yep.

24:26.559 --> 24:27.560
Together?

24:27.593 --> 24:28.794
No, no.

24:28.828 --> 24:30.696
We're just friends.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.632
Yeah, we're not together.

24:32.665 --> 24:33.866
We just fuck.

24:33.900 --> 24:36.168
Taylor.

24:38.537 --> 24:41.140
Well, let's get you folks back
on the road then.

24:43.976 --> 24:44.944
So you can fix it?

24:44.977 --> 24:46.145
Hell, no.

24:46.178 --> 24:47.914
But you still... you don't
even know what's wrong with it.

24:47.947 --> 24:49.448
I don't need to.

24:49.482 --> 24:52.919
I ain't got no replacement
radiators here anyhow.

24:52.952 --> 24:57.456
Best thing you folks can do
is call a tow truck.

24:57.490 --> 24:59.692
Get your asses back to the car,
you can get towed

24:59.725 --> 25:00.760
to Spencerville,

25:00.793 --> 25:04.063
and get it fixed there you know,
when you're home,

25:04.096 --> 25:06.866
safe and sound.

25:06.899 --> 25:11.003
Um, uh, okay, yeah,
that was plan B so...

25:11.037 --> 25:13.139
Well, boy, it's plan A now.

25:16.142 --> 25:17.543
You know the number?

25:17.576 --> 25:18.811
Off my heart.

25:35.628 --> 25:38.164
Willard, got a car,
needs to tow.

25:38.197 --> 25:40.099
Uh, 2½ miles south of here.

25:40.132 --> 25:43.069
Kid says they need
to go Spencerville.

25:43.102 --> 25:45.004
Mmhmm.

25:45.037 --> 25:46.238
What kinda car is it?

25:46.272 --> 25:47.640
'81 Monte Carlo.

25:47.673 --> 25:50.042
It's a Chev, radiator shot.

25:51.077 --> 25:53.012
Uh-huh.

25:53.045 --> 25:55.281
Hmm.

25:55.314 --> 25:57.984
Says he can be there
in a half hour.

25:58.017 --> 26:00.553
Great,
we'll start back right now.

26:00.586 --> 26:01.787
I mean friends
are there already, so...

26:01.821 --> 26:03.789
Your friends?

26:03.823 --> 26:06.192
Uh, yeah.

26:06.225 --> 26:09.862
We got two friends back
at the car.

26:09.895 --> 26:13.132
Oh.

26:14.166 --> 26:16.969
He says there's two more of them
back at the car.

26:17.003 --> 26:18.704
Mmhmm, I know.

26:22.074 --> 26:24.176
Well, look, um,
why don't you pick them up here?

26:24.210 --> 26:25.845
No sense them
walking all that way

26:25.878 --> 26:29.081
if you're
gonna drive past anyhow.

26:29.115 --> 26:30.883
Right, right.

26:30.916 --> 26:32.785
Alright.

26:34.053 --> 26:36.555
Half hour.

26:36.589 --> 26:39.091
It's Willard you said?

26:39.125 --> 26:41.027
Willard, that's right.

26:41.060 --> 26:42.962
Great.

27:05.885 --> 27:07.987
What is that?

27:17.863 --> 27:19.131
Did he just take our picture?

27:19.165 --> 27:21.367
Yeah.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.802
Where's your camera?

27:34.980 --> 27:36.048
That was fuckin' weird.

27:36.082 --> 27:36.615
Did you get it?

27:59.405 --> 28:01.740
Where the fuck
is this tow truck?

28:01.774 --> 28:02.442
Just relax.

28:02.476 --> 28:03.809
No, the guy's a fuckin' ass...

28:03.843 --> 28:06.312
Hey, keep your voice down.

28:06.345 --> 28:09.248
He even talks weird.

28:09.281 --> 28:11.851
I'm out.

28:11.884 --> 28:12.685
What are you doing?

28:12.718 --> 28:14.820
Just pick me up on the way.

28:17.823 --> 28:19.358
Pick you up on the way.

28:19.391 --> 28:21.360
Fuck you,
pick you up on the way.

28:37.977 --> 28:39.745
Dammit!

28:43.749 --> 28:45.017
Come on.

28:45.050 --> 28:46.719
Oh God.

28:55.027 --> 28:56.962
Oh, maybe we're
gonna be here all day s...

28:56.996 --> 29:00.766
Hey, uh, you alright back there?

29:03.802 --> 29:06.272
No!

29:06.305 --> 29:10.142
You, goddamn bitch,
you mother preacher cuss.

29:10.176 --> 29:11.210
Come on!

29:11.243 --> 29:11.877
Come on, baby.

29:17.983 --> 29:19.185
Yeah.

29:21.320 --> 29:22.354
What is that?

29:24.390 --> 29:26.292
Hobby of mine.

29:26.325 --> 29:26.992
Antique.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.061
Fuckin' if I get the...

29:32.031 --> 29:34.166
Son of a bitch!

29:34.200 --> 29:34.733
You okay?

29:35.801 --> 29:37.236
Yeah.

29:37.269 --> 29:40.873
One goddamn level won't budge.

29:40.906 --> 29:42.374
Why don't you
let me give it a go?

29:44.410 --> 29:46.078
Be my guest.

29:46.111 --> 29:47.813
Watch your finger.

29:56.556 --> 29:58.525
Yeah,
it's on there pretty tight.

30:09.101 --> 30:10.970
Why the fuck
would did he do that?

30:13.405 --> 30:15.307
I'm leaving.

30:19.345 --> 30:21.013
Wait.

30:56.415 --> 31:00.419
Maybe it's just some
weird dude taking photos of shit.

31:00.453 --> 31:01.987
Sure, way off the main road,

31:02.021 --> 31:05.024
it's miles and miles
from anywhere.

31:17.604 --> 31:19.539
What is it?

31:20.440 --> 31:21.940
It's us.

31:27.514 --> 31:29.915
Stay close to me
with that thing.

31:29.948 --> 31:32.017
Let's get
to this fucking gas station.

31:47.567 --> 31:49.436
Mike?

31:51.571 --> 31:53.440
Hello?

31:55.508 --> 31:56.008
Anyone?

31:56.041 --> 31:56.942
Help you?

31:56.975 --> 31:59.278
Holy shit,
you scared the fuck out of me.

31:59.311 --> 32:00.447
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.914
Where's my friend?

32:01.947 --> 32:04.149
Oh, um, bathroom.

32:04.183 --> 32:05.951
I called for
him, he didn't answer.

32:05.984 --> 32:08.954
Oh, it's... it's in the back,
kinda hard to hear.

32:08.987 --> 32:10.856
You can go on in if you want.

32:14.026 --> 32:14.893
That's alright.

32:14.927 --> 32:17.363
I'll wait for him outside.

32:17.396 --> 32:19.031
Suit yourself.

32:49.696 --> 32:51.397
Where's this bathroom?

32:56.503 --> 32:58.671
Mike, come on!

33:00.740 --> 33:03.510
Darlin', you wanna talk to him,
you go back there.

33:03.543 --> 33:05.612
I'm tryin' to concentrate now.

33:05.645 --> 33:07.312
It's delicate.

33:22.662 --> 33:24.296
Mike!

35:50.743 --> 35:51.744
Taylor.

35:51.778 --> 35:54.246
Taylor, Taylor!

35:54.279 --> 35:54.781
Taylor.

35:54.814 --> 35:56.783
Taylor, don't worry.

35:56.816 --> 35:58.518
Taylor, come on.

35:58.551 --> 35:59.452
Stop!

35:59.485 --> 36:00.352
Hey, stop!

36:03.388 --> 36:05.257
Stop.

36:09.161 --> 36:09.896
Good boy.

36:17.369 --> 36:21.774
That is one fine-lookin' piece
of meat you got yourself there.

36:21.808 --> 36:22.875
You really fuckin' her?

36:25.845 --> 36:27.580
Yeah?

36:27.614 --> 36:29.214
So you are together.

36:30.382 --> 36:32.351
Yeah?

36:32.384 --> 36:33.385
You're together.

36:35.387 --> 36:37.222
Oh.

36:37.255 --> 36:42.160
Now, you just... now, you got me
all confused Michael,

36:42.194 --> 36:46.933
because if that fine-lookin'
piece of meat is with you,

36:46.966 --> 36:50.570
then who on earth is this other

36:50.603 --> 36:53.740
equally-fine lookin' piece
of meat I found in your wallet?

36:53.773 --> 36:54.373
Hmm?

36:54.406 --> 36:56.174
Mmhmm?

36:56.208 --> 36:58.444
I mean they... they similar,
but they ain't the same.

36:59.244 --> 36:59.679
Huh?

37:05.718 --> 37:07.453
Did you just lie to me?

37:12.290 --> 37:15.260
Yeah, you did.

37:16.361 --> 37:18.296
You been a bad boy, Michael?

37:21.501 --> 37:23.636
Yeah, yep.

37:24.437 --> 37:25.303
Yep, you have.

37:26.673 --> 37:28.675
You've been sticking
your nasty little pecker

37:28.708 --> 37:30.743
in everythin' you can,
haven't you?

37:33.579 --> 37:34.947
It's alright.

37:35.782 --> 37:38.484
It's alright.

37:38.518 --> 37:40.285
We all bad around here.

38:09.816 --> 38:11.017
Oh, oh, oh.

38:11.050 --> 38:13.218
We're gonna have some fun today.

38:33.473 --> 38:34.474
What is it?

38:34.507 --> 38:36.374
It's another one.

38:38.778 --> 38:40.446
What's wrong?

38:43.415 --> 38:45.585
Bitch.

38:52.692 --> 38:56.462
That guy took the picture.

38:56.496 --> 39:00.298
Just like he took ours.

39:00.332 --> 39:02.535
Whatever's goin' on here,
it's fucked,

39:02.568 --> 39:06.038
and we gotta go right now!

39:06.072 --> 39:09.475
But why are they doing this?

39:09.509 --> 39:09.909
What?

39:09.942 --> 39:11.677
Cheating on us?

39:11.711 --> 39:13.411
Yeah.

39:14.412 --> 39:14.881
I just...

39:16.983 --> 39:20.720
I just don't get it.

39:20.753 --> 39:23.656
Okay.

39:23.689 --> 39:26.626
First boyfriend,
three awesome years together,

39:26.659 --> 39:28.761
best friends.

39:28.795 --> 39:30.663
He fucked around on me.

39:30.696 --> 39:33.699
I wanted to know why
just like you do now.

39:33.733 --> 39:36.002
You wanna know what he told me?

39:36.035 --> 39:39.438
You wanna know why he did it?

39:39.472 --> 39:41.908
Because he did.

39:41.941 --> 39:44.342
Because it happens.

39:44.376 --> 39:48.681
Because people are shitty
and that's what people do.

39:48.714 --> 39:50.983
And that's
the only truth you'll ever get.

39:55.655 --> 39:56.589
But I just don't...

39:57.857 --> 39:59.625
What the fuck!

40:12.438 --> 40:13.405
Run!

43:55.928 --> 43:56.929
Hey!

43:58.631 --> 43:59.932
Hey!

43:59.965 --> 44:01.033
Hey!

44:02.201 --> 44:03.669
Hey!

44:03.702 --> 44:05.604
Hey!

44:08.040 --> 44:11.143
Hey, you gotta help me.

44:11.177 --> 44:13.979
There's a crazy guy out there.

44:14.013 --> 44:14.780
- There's a...
- Hold on, alright.

44:14.814 --> 44:15.614
- There's...
- Well... well, hold on.

44:15.648 --> 44:16.682
- There's...
- Hold... what happened?

44:16.715 --> 44:19.018
- There's a man, he's got my friend.
- Calm down.

44:19.051 --> 44:20.920
We gotta call the
police right now.

44:20.953 --> 44:22.822
Alright, alright, I got a phone
in the... In the house.

44:22.855 --> 44:23.622
Go on, get in.

44:23.656 --> 44:24.857
Go on.

44:29.095 --> 44:30.930
Alright, we're safe.

45:19.044 --> 45:20.146
Alright,
it don't look that much,

45:20.179 --> 45:21.213
but there's a phone inside.

45:21.247 --> 45:22.748
Go on in.

45:38.898 --> 45:40.232
Oh, go ahead.

45:46.772 --> 45:48.174
I don't think it's working.

45:59.818 --> 46:03.022
You're gonna
wanna be careful with that.

46:03.055 --> 46:04.723
It's an antique.

46:10.430 --> 46:12.432
Never ceases to amaze me

46:12.465 --> 46:15.435
how desperation
makes people so blind.

46:18.871 --> 46:20.507
What do you want?

46:20.540 --> 46:21.740
What do I want?

46:26.278 --> 46:28.247
I wanna
lay down some ground rules.

46:30.983 --> 46:32.284
Yeah?

46:33.486 --> 46:36.755
1,

46:36.789 --> 46:38.958
you speak out of turn to me

46:38.991 --> 46:41.927
and I'll blow
that pretty jaw off.

46:43.530 --> 46:45.432
2,

46:45.465 --> 46:49.802
you do anythin' other than
exactly what I tell you to do,

46:49.835 --> 46:52.871
I'm gonna shoot off one
of your extremities.

46:52.905 --> 46:55.140
Maybe a hand at first,
I don't know.

46:55.174 --> 46:57.409
Do it again, a foot.

46:57.444 --> 46:59.878
Do it more than four times,

46:59.912 --> 47:02.314
I will blow off that pretty head
of yours.

47:10.322 --> 47:12.391
Understood?

47:12.424 --> 47:13.792
Why are you doing this?

47:16.028 --> 47:16.829
Oh, you...

47:17.564 --> 47:19.098
You don't... didn't get it?

47:21.100 --> 47:24.437
That's speakin' out of turn.

47:24.471 --> 47:26.805
You're speakin' out of turn.

47:26.839 --> 47:27.906
Understood?

47:36.348 --> 47:39.251
Come on, why don't you come
help me with somethin'?

47:39.285 --> 47:41.353
Go on,
you can make yourself useful.

47:41.387 --> 47:43.956
Come on.

47:43.989 --> 47:46.493
Come on.

48:04.577 --> 48:05.244
No.

48:05.277 --> 48:06.078
No.

48:06.111 --> 48:08.080
No, I don't know.

48:08.113 --> 48:09.148
No, go on.

48:31.471 --> 48:33.038
Well, go on.

48:33.072 --> 48:35.007
She ain't dead or nothin',
get her out!

48:45.618 --> 48:47.152
Come on.

48:47.186 --> 48:48.555
Don't be such a fuckin' sissy.

48:48.588 --> 48:50.457
Come on.

48:51.290 --> 48:52.925
Let's go!

48:59.599 --> 49:02.101
Well, let's not try to kill her
in the process, shall we?

49:05.605 --> 49:06.439
What are you doin'?

49:06.473 --> 49:07.674
Pick her up!

49:07.707 --> 49:09.174
Come on.

49:13.412 --> 49:16.382
I said, "Pick her up."

49:18.618 --> 49:22.287
Pick her up,
throw her over your shoulder,

49:22.321 --> 49:23.490
and let's walk her inside!

49:23.523 --> 49:25.023
No, fuck you!

49:25.057 --> 49:25.924
Do not...

49:25.958 --> 49:26.860
No.

49:26.892 --> 49:29.027
Take that tone with me,
you fuckin' cunt!

49:29.061 --> 49:30.229
You remember the rules?

49:30.262 --> 49:32.364
"You remember the rules?"
I said!

49:32.398 --> 49:33.666
You pick her up!

49:33.700 --> 49:36.268
Pick her up!

49:36.301 --> 49:39.639
Pick her up.

50:10.202 --> 50:11.403
Go on.

50:17.176 --> 50:20.045
You can go ahead
and put her over there.

50:39.466 --> 50:43.068
That'll do, darlin', for now.

51:36.523 --> 51:40.560
"To be...

51:40.593 --> 51:42.795
...or not to be."

51:44.697 --> 51:47.433
"That is the question.

51:50.503 --> 51:53.305
Whether 'tis nobler

51:53.338 --> 51:57.544
in the mind to suffer

51:57.577 --> 52:01.146
the slings and arrows

52:01.179 --> 52:04.149
of outrageous fortune."

52:07.520 --> 52:11.858
"Or to take arms

52:11.891 --> 52:15.728
against a sea of troubles,

52:15.762 --> 52:22.602
and by opposin' end them,

52:22.635 --> 52:25.170
to die, to sleep,

52:25.203 --> 52:26.371
no more."

52:27.640 --> 52:33.646
"And by a sleep
to say we end the hea...

52:33.680 --> 52:35.848
heartache,

52:35.882 --> 52:40.553
and the thousand natural shocks

52:40.587 --> 52:44.724
that flesh is heir to?

52:44.757 --> 52:49.127
'Tis a con... con...

52:50.430 --> 52:52.331
Consummation!

52:56.669 --> 52:59.472
"Consummation."

53:00.473 --> 53:07.614
"Devoutly to be wish'd to die,

53:07.647 --> 53:11.283
to sleep.

53:11.316 --> 53:15.153
To sleep, perchance to dream."

53:18.190 --> 53:23.896
"Ay, there's the rub,

53:23.930 --> 53:28.166
for in that sleep of death,

53:28.200 --> 53:31.236
what dreams may come,

53:31.269 --> 53:35.475
when we have
shuffled off this..."

53:37.644 --> 53:39.479
"Mortal coil."

54:29.662 --> 54:32.598
Yes, finally,
ladies, ladies, ladies,

54:32.632 --> 54:36.401
welcome back to the land
of the livin'.

54:36.436 --> 54:37.804
Oh, well, I thought you was
never gonna wake up.

54:40.006 --> 54:41.074
Now, that you have,

54:41.107 --> 54:43.609
I can see you're both
looking good enough to eat.

54:44.744 --> 54:46.946
Metaphorically speaking,
of course.

54:46.979 --> 54:48.881
We don't actually
eat people around here,

54:48.915 --> 54:52.719
that'll be a little too cliché.

54:52.752 --> 54:56.789
Our Ox, however,
he developed a taste

54:56.823 --> 55:01.894
for that warm, soft human flesh.

55:01.928 --> 55:03.930
No accountin' for his tastes.

55:03.963 --> 55:06.566
Mine, um, I'm more
of a steak man I guess.

55:06.599 --> 55:08.366
Like a thick juicy k...

55:08.400 --> 55:11.804
Hold on, y'all
ain't no vegetarians, are you?

55:11.838 --> 55:14.339
Good, 'cause I fuckin' hate
those people.

55:14.372 --> 55:15.441
I'm sorry, baby.

55:15.475 --> 55:17.744
I know those things might be
a little uncomfortable,

55:17.777 --> 55:21.814
but believe me when I say
they are for your own good.

55:21.848 --> 55:23.449
You don't understand
they're worse things

55:23.483 --> 55:24.851
than me here.

55:24.884 --> 55:27.687
My brother hears one word out
of your mouth,

55:27.720 --> 55:29.555
he will
cut your fuckin' tongue out.

55:30.823 --> 55:34.026
See, he crazy, you know?

55:34.060 --> 55:36.763
In the head.

55:36.796 --> 55:38.598
Now, who we got here.

55:38.631 --> 55:41.501
Let's do these introductions.

55:41.534 --> 55:44.604
You must be Taylor,
is that correct?

55:44.637 --> 55:46.806
Which makes you Jenna.

55:46.839 --> 55:48.941
Happy belated, by the way.

55:48.975 --> 55:51.309
In case, you all didn't know,
I'm Owen.

55:51.343 --> 55:54.981
I thought it might be prudent
to kick off these proceedings

55:55.014 --> 55:57.083
with a little demonstration.

55:57.116 --> 55:59.619
Oswald!

56:16.836 --> 56:19.337
Honey, he don't like it
when people stare.

56:31.984 --> 56:36.122
Now, manners are so
very, very important, ladies.

56:36.155 --> 56:38.057
That's why my brother here
is gonna show you

56:38.090 --> 56:42.762
fine young pieces of meat
exactly what will befall you

56:42.795 --> 56:45.498
if you do not do
what you're told.

56:46.833 --> 56:51.103
Oswald, go ahead.

57:30.209 --> 57:32.011
Shut up!

57:35.648 --> 57:39.986
Well, ladies,
I say that's pretty clear, hmm?

57:40.019 --> 57:43.923
No confusion, no ambiguity,
wouldn't you say so?

57:43.956 --> 57:45.925
We should take your
stunned silence as compliance.

57:46.726 --> 57:47.126
Hmm?

57:50.696 --> 57:53.499
Hey, take him outside.

57:53.532 --> 57:54.667
Cut him up
while he's still fresh.

57:54.700 --> 57:55.968
Go on.

57:56.736 --> 57:58.437
It's feedin' time.

58:02.775 --> 58:05.044
Goddammit.

58:05.077 --> 58:06.445
Hey, hey, hey

58:06.479 --> 58:07.079
Hey, hey, listen.

58:08.147 --> 58:09.949
Hey, hey, you gonna behave
if I take this out?

58:15.688 --> 58:16.656
Oh, alright.

58:16.689 --> 58:17.223
You're alright.

58:18.391 --> 58:21.961
Listen, no need to feel ashamed,
lots of people do that.

58:21.994 --> 58:24.964
It'll be alright,
it'll be alright.

58:28.034 --> 58:29.068
What the fuck is going on?

58:29.101 --> 58:30.670
Where's Mike?

58:35.141 --> 58:36.742
Now.

58:39.211 --> 58:43.015
I know, I know, this might
feel a little better though, hmm?

58:43.749 --> 58:44.784
Do you feel a little refreshed?

58:45.618 --> 58:47.520
Well, in answer
to your question,

58:47.553 --> 58:50.690
Michael will be here shortly.

58:50.723 --> 58:52.725
Of course, he may not be
in one piece when he gets here,

58:52.758 --> 58:55.127
but he will be here nonetheless.

58:58.130 --> 59:00.032
Which reminds me,

59:00.066 --> 59:03.636
and I don't mean to be
the bringer of bad tidings,

59:03.669 --> 59:04.270
but this one...

59:05.204 --> 59:06.839
She been carryin' on
with your old man

59:06.872 --> 59:08.541
behind your back.

59:12.878 --> 59:15.748
Oh, you already know.

59:16.649 --> 59:20.052
Well, ain't that somethin', huh?

59:20.086 --> 59:22.188
You know, I read this thing
somewhere once.

59:22.221 --> 59:24.023
It said the people
in this country think

59:24.056 --> 59:25.091
that cheatin' on 'em

59:25.124 --> 59:28.728
is just about the worst thing
you can do to 'em.

59:28.761 --> 59:31.063
The second worst is to kill 'em.

59:31.097 --> 59:31.864
You find that messed up?

59:34.667 --> 59:37.636
I'ma see Michael real soon.

59:37.670 --> 59:38.804
You want me
to say somethin' to him?

59:39.271 --> 59:40.072
You love him?

59:41.107 --> 59:41.741
You miss him?

59:43.175 --> 59:43.909
Or you hate him?

59:45.578 --> 59:48.214
You can tell me.

59:49.348 --> 59:51.317
You know, I don't really go in
for all that drama,

59:51.350 --> 59:53.786
I'm gonna let you two
work it all out,

59:53.819 --> 59:55.688
get your affairs in order.

01:00:47.807 --> 01:00:49.708
Taylor.

01:00:49.742 --> 01:00:50.776
Taylor.

01:00:51.744 --> 01:00:52.178
What?

01:01:17.803 --> 01:01:20.739
1, 2, 3.

01:02:02.781 --> 01:02:05.351
1, 2, 3.

01:02:51.063 --> 01:02:52.798
Get up, get up, get up.

01:03:07.313 --> 01:03:08.214
Where's the car?

01:03:08.247 --> 01:03:09.215
What?

01:03:09.248 --> 01:03:10.282
We called for a tow truck.

01:03:10.316 --> 01:03:11.317
Oh.

01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:13.052
Um, this way.

01:03:13.085 --> 01:03:14.386
This way.

01:03:42.881 --> 01:03:45.918
♪ When I die bury me ♪

01:03:45.951 --> 01:03:48.887
♪ Hang my balls
on a cherry tree ♪

01:03:48.921 --> 01:03:50.457
♪ When they ripe, take a bite ♪

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:53.058
♪ Don't blame me,
if they don't taste right ♪

01:04:06.473 --> 01:04:11.377
Hey, Michael.

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:14.246
You awake?

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.016
Psst.

01:04:22.121 --> 01:04:24.156
Oh what?

01:04:24.189 --> 01:04:25.257
Think you're
the first pretty boy

01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:26.925
to play dead to avoid the prod?

01:04:26.959 --> 01:04:28.260
Yeah, you ain't.

01:04:28.294 --> 01:04:30.396
And it ain't gonna be the last.

01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:31.363
Why are you doing this?

01:04:32.264 --> 01:04:33.433
Why am I doing this?

01:04:33.466 --> 01:04:34.701
Is that what you said?

01:04:34.734 --> 01:04:37.169
Why does everybody ask that same
fuckin' predictable question?

01:04:37.202 --> 01:04:39.071
'Cause it needs doin'.

01:04:39.104 --> 01:04:40.839
Now, I'd like to take a trip

01:04:40.873 --> 01:04:43.375
as soon as I can have you
giving me any trouble, though.

01:04:43.409 --> 01:04:45.944
I'd like to put you out again
I'm afraid.

01:04:45.978 --> 01:04:47.179
I know, I know.

01:04:47.212 --> 01:04:50.082
Oh, I know, I know,
but like I said...

01:04:52.051 --> 01:04:52.719
It needs doin'.

01:04:52.752 --> 01:04:54.253
Now, I'm in a good mood, okay?

01:04:54.286 --> 01:04:56.388
So I'm gonna give you a choice.

01:04:56.422 --> 01:04:57.624
How do you want it?

01:04:57.657 --> 01:05:00.426
You want Jenna
or you want Taylor?

01:05:01.494 --> 01:05:02.328
What?

01:05:02.361 --> 01:05:04.564
Michael,
that's the real question, yeah.

01:05:04.597 --> 01:05:07.534
Which girl's Michael
gonna choose?

01:05:07.567 --> 01:05:08.535
Jenna?

01:05:08.568 --> 01:05:10.637
She's nice, she's feisty.

01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:13.072
I like that.

01:05:13.105 --> 01:05:14.641
Taylor.

01:05:16.041 --> 01:05:16.576
Which one?

01:05:16.609 --> 01:05:17.444
Which one, which one?

01:05:17.477 --> 01:05:18.077
Which one?

01:05:18.645 --> 01:05:20.245
Yeah, you know what?

01:05:20.279 --> 01:05:22.582
I wanna be surprised.

01:05:22.615 --> 01:05:25.050
Don't tell me, don't tell me.

01:05:34.627 --> 01:05:35.628
Oh, there he is.

01:05:35.662 --> 01:05:37.262
Hey!

01:05:37.296 --> 01:05:38.964
Hey!

01:05:38.997 --> 01:05:41.066
Hey.

01:05:42.134 --> 01:05:44.437
Hey!

01:05:44.471 --> 01:05:45.404
Thank God, you're still here.

01:05:47.306 --> 01:05:49.007
Of course, I'm here.

01:05:49.041 --> 01:05:50.075
You called, didn't you?

01:05:50.109 --> 01:05:52.479
Yeah, but we need
to leave this place right now.

01:05:52.512 --> 01:05:54.213
Mmhmm, well, that is the plan,

01:05:54.246 --> 01:05:58.217
but like what the hell happened
to you?

01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:59.918
Some of these guys out there
and they...

01:05:59.952 --> 01:06:00.919
They killed our friend.

01:06:00.953 --> 01:06:02.154
What?

01:06:02.187 --> 01:06:03.155
Who?

01:06:03.188 --> 01:06:04.990
That guy Owen.

01:06:05.023 --> 01:06:06.593
Owen Watson?

01:06:06.626 --> 01:06:10.597
And had some crazy,
this fucking psycho, he, um...

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:12.197
Oswald.

01:06:12.231 --> 01:06:14.333
I know Owen.

01:06:14.366 --> 01:06:15.033
Don't know no Oswald.

01:06:15.067 --> 01:06:17.336
Oh, we have to get out of here!

01:06:17.369 --> 01:06:18.971
Can we go like right now?

01:06:21.508 --> 01:06:22.609
Please.

01:06:25.411 --> 01:06:27.312
Yeah, alright.

01:06:27.346 --> 01:06:28.947
Get in the car.

01:06:28.981 --> 01:06:30.650
We can't ride with you?

01:06:30.683 --> 01:06:34.153
Nobody rides in my baby but me.

01:06:34.186 --> 01:06:36.489
Now, just get in the car.

01:06:36.523 --> 01:06:38.257
- Fuck.
- Come on, Jen.

01:07:18.063 --> 01:07:23.135
So um,
you know about me and Mike?

01:07:23.168 --> 01:07:26.138
That's the last fucking thing
I wanna talk about right now.

01:07:26.171 --> 01:07:27.640
I know, I...
I just wanted to say that...

01:07:27.674 --> 01:07:29.208
Don't.

01:07:32.612 --> 01:07:35.047
I wanted to say thank you
for getting us out of there.

01:07:39.619 --> 01:07:41.488
Yeah, sure.

01:08:14.687 --> 01:08:15.488
What the fuck?

01:08:15.522 --> 01:08:17.189
Why did we stop?

01:08:37.209 --> 01:08:38.778
Get out, girls.

01:08:43.215 --> 01:08:46.618
I'm gonna give you five seconds
to get out of the car

01:08:46.653 --> 01:08:50.288
or I just shoot you
through the window.

01:08:50.322 --> 01:08:52.591
5, 4...

01:08:52.625 --> 01:08:54.158
What do we do?

01:08:54.192 --> 01:08:57.362
3, 2...

01:09:01.332 --> 01:09:03.603
Good girls.

01:09:03.636 --> 01:09:05.505
Couple of good girls.

01:09:08.841 --> 01:09:11.410
Now, despite what you
might be thinkin',

01:09:11.444 --> 01:09:15.113
I'm not the bad guy.

01:09:15.147 --> 01:09:18.116
I'm Willard.

01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:20.118
What's your name?

01:09:20.152 --> 01:09:21.621
Taylor.

01:09:21.654 --> 01:09:24.389
Taylor.

01:09:24.423 --> 01:09:26.158
I like that name.

01:09:28.493 --> 01:09:31.395
You?

01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:34.166
Her name is Jenna.

01:09:34.198 --> 01:09:36.769
Jenna.

01:09:36.803 --> 01:09:39.371
Jenna and Taylor.

01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:44.309
Oh, it's like uh,
porno names, huh?

01:09:48.514 --> 01:09:50.683
Alright.

01:09:50.716 --> 01:09:55.220
Now that that's over with,
start walkin'.

01:10:04.564 --> 01:10:08.300
You gonna make me count
to five again.

01:10:09.702 --> 01:10:12.505
Now, if you wanted to die,
sugar,

01:10:12.538 --> 01:10:15.273
you'd just stayed in the car.

01:11:09.361 --> 01:11:11.531
Just do what you're told,
that's all you gotta do,

01:11:11.564 --> 01:11:15.635
just do what you're told!

01:11:20.039 --> 01:11:23.308
Let me go to her,
let me go to her.

01:11:28.681 --> 01:11:33.418
This is what happens when you
don't do what you're told.

01:11:42.427 --> 01:11:44.664
I'm sorry.

01:11:54.841 --> 01:11:56.743
No!

01:12:11.958 --> 01:12:12.925
Where is Oxford?

01:12:12.959 --> 01:12:13.826
In his den.

01:12:15.962 --> 01:12:18.664
Shit load of
good he does you there.

01:12:18.698 --> 01:12:20.066
Not allowed to let him out.

01:12:25.571 --> 01:12:28.541
You ever heard the expression

01:12:28.574 --> 01:12:31.978
"waste not, want not"?

01:12:32.011 --> 01:12:34.447
No.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:39.018
Well, basically,
what it means is

01:12:39.051 --> 01:12:43.723
when you lock into pussy
that good,

01:12:43.756 --> 01:12:48.494
you don't go slicing it up.

01:12:48.528 --> 01:12:51.764
That's a fuckin' waste.

01:12:51.798 --> 01:12:55.668
You best not talk
to me like that, Willard.

01:12:55.701 --> 01:12:59.639
You don't call the shots
around here.

01:12:59.672 --> 01:13:02.441
When Owen's not around,

01:13:02.475 --> 01:13:05.310
I do call the shots around here.

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:09.982
Open the door.

01:13:19.826 --> 01:13:21.460
Out.

01:13:30.136 --> 01:13:31.470
Introduce yourself.

01:13:40.446 --> 01:13:42.949
You best fix that goddamn door.

01:13:42.982 --> 01:13:45.751
No.

01:13:45.785 --> 01:13:50.590
You do what the
fuck I tell you to do, boy.

01:13:51.123 --> 01:13:53.425
Don't call me "boy".

01:13:53.459 --> 01:13:55.661
Sometimes, I think it'd be best

01:13:55.695 --> 01:13:59.966
to just blow your goddamn fool
crazy head off.

01:14:01.934 --> 01:14:06.404
Make things a lot easier
for the rest of us.

01:14:15.181 --> 01:14:17.683
Owen would kill you.

01:14:24.557 --> 01:14:25.558
Yeah.

01:14:28.527 --> 01:14:31.197
Okay,
you just go on thinkin' that.

01:14:32.565 --> 01:14:33.432
Boy.

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:36.836
Don't call me "boy".

01:15:03.896 --> 01:15:06.198
Oh.

01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:11.170
Oh my God.

01:15:14.173 --> 01:15:18.044
I can get us out of here.

01:15:18.077 --> 01:15:20.613
How long have you been
in this place?

01:15:25.084 --> 01:15:27.119
What's wrong?

01:15:30.823 --> 01:15:32.692
What?

01:15:40.232 --> 01:15:41.968
Oh no.

01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:47.273
You're alive.

01:15:47.306 --> 01:15:49.208
That's what matters.

01:15:49.241 --> 01:15:52.144
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:15:52.178 --> 01:15:54.947
I'm gonna get your baby out
of here.

01:16:01.554 --> 01:16:03.255
Here, alright, come here.

01:16:48.801 --> 01:16:50.903
Here.

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:29.775
Stop.

01:18:53.125 --> 01:18:54.193
Willard.

01:18:54.226 --> 01:18:55.895
One of these days, Owen,
that little brother of yours

01:18:55.928 --> 01:18:58.431
is gonna fuck things up in ways
that we can't fix.

01:18:58.465 --> 01:18:59.365
Alright, what happened?

01:18:59.398 --> 01:19:01.267
You had two girls
up at the barn, right?

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:02.201
Yeah.

01:19:02.234 --> 01:19:04.270
But now, you only got one.

01:19:04.303 --> 01:19:08.207
They turned the tables on Oswald
and they were all but gone.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.042
I locked into 'em at the car
and brought 'em back,

01:19:10.075 --> 01:19:11.977
but then he's gotta go
and slice one of them up.

01:19:12.011 --> 01:19:12.912
Alright, hold your horses.

01:19:12.945 --> 01:19:14.246
Now, what the fuck's goin' on
with that?

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:15.314
Hold your horses, Willard!

01:19:15.347 --> 01:19:16.949
This has never happened
when your mother was here,

01:19:16.982 --> 01:19:17.950
do you understand?

01:19:17.983 --> 01:19:21.854
I mean for the love of Christ,
you rein him in!

01:19:21.887 --> 01:19:24.924
You know, you are here
by the grace of one person

01:19:24.957 --> 01:19:27.393
and one person only,
that sure is telling God.

01:19:27.426 --> 01:19:28.093
Willard!

01:19:28.127 --> 01:19:29.161
Willard!

01:19:43.943 --> 01:19:46.779
Oswald!

01:19:46.812 --> 01:19:47.913
Oswald!

01:19:49.482 --> 01:19:50.349
Oh, you.

01:19:54.186 --> 01:19:55.120
Oswald!

01:19:57.223 --> 01:19:59.792
Oswald!

01:19:59.825 --> 01:20:02.394
What in the fuck is goin' on?

01:20:03.362 --> 01:20:04.997
I just passed Uncle Willard
on the road.

01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:08.000
He tells me this whole place
has gone to hell!

01:20:08.033 --> 01:20:09.868
Oh, you can't talk to me?

01:20:09.902 --> 01:20:12.171
Oswald, hey,
what the fuck is goin' on?

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:15.207
Oswald!

01:20:17.309 --> 01:20:18.277
What?

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:21.514
Goddammit!

01:20:26.986 --> 01:20:29.221
What the fuck is this shit?

01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:31.857
I knew it!

01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:33.292
You can't do nothin' right.

01:20:33.325 --> 01:20:34.827
You can't do...
you're so stupid, Oswald!

01:20:35.394 --> 01:20:36.395
Shut up!

01:20:36.428 --> 01:20:38.230
No, you shut up.

01:20:41.333 --> 01:20:44.437
Don't talk to me like that!

01:20:46.905 --> 01:20:49.942
What the fuck is wrong with me?

01:20:49.975 --> 01:20:53.546
Oswald,
you can't do nothing right!

01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:54.581
Shut up!

01:20:54.614 --> 01:20:56.048
Alright, alright!

01:20:56.949 --> 01:20:57.416
Alright, alright.

01:20:57.450 --> 01:20:59.385
Alright.

01:20:59.418 --> 01:21:00.853
Oswald.

01:21:01.488 --> 01:21:02.121
Hey, alright.

01:21:02.154 --> 01:21:03.856
Hey, stop.

01:21:05.492 --> 01:21:06.493
I'm sorry.

01:21:06.526 --> 01:21:08.227
Okay, I'm...

01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:08.662
I'm s...

01:21:09.496 --> 01:21:11.230
I'm sorry.

01:21:11.263 --> 01:21:12.831
That wasn't delicate, I know.

01:21:12.865 --> 01:21:14.400
Come...

01:21:14.434 --> 01:21:16.569
Oswald, I'm sorry, come on.

01:21:17.303 --> 01:21:18.037
Come on.

01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:19.004

Oswald, okay,
look, listen to me.

01:22:06.919 --> 01:22:08.287
Listen to me.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.189
Sometimes, these things

01:22:10.222 --> 01:22:11.658
they just don't go the way
we planned, okay?

01:22:11.691 --> 01:22:12.991
That's just life.

01:22:14.293 --> 01:22:15.894
That's just life,
that's alright.

01:22:16.563 --> 01:22:17.329
That's alright, because...

01:22:17.363 --> 01:22:19.031
'Cause Owen gonna
take care of it.

01:22:19.064 --> 01:22:21.501
He gonna clean all this mess up.

01:22:21.534 --> 01:22:23.503
Wait, look, why don't you go...

01:22:23.536 --> 01:22:24.637
Why don't you go
clear your head,

01:22:24.671 --> 01:22:29.274
take a... take a walk and I'll...
I'll clean all this up.

01:22:29.308 --> 01:22:30.142
Yeah.

01:22:38.451 --> 01:22:40.185
Alright.

01:22:50.463 --> 01:22:54.032
Jesus, Jesus Christ.

01:23:09.047 --> 01:23:11.016
Perfect.

01:23:19.057 --> 01:23:21.326
Well,
I guess we don't need to worry about

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.530
which one of us
is daddy no more.

01:23:29.602 --> 01:23:33.105
Well, we'll just keep that
to ourselves, shall we?

01:23:34.507 --> 01:23:36.041
And Oswald was
so lookin' forward

01:23:36.074 --> 01:23:38.110
to bein' a daddy.

01:23:38.143 --> 01:23:43.115
Well, I think we both know
that's not a good idea.

01:23:43.148 --> 01:23:45.184
Alright,
let's get you out of here.

01:23:55.495 --> 01:23:56.395
Goddammit!

01:24:46.613 --> 01:24:48.413
Wake up.

01:24:48.448 --> 01:24:49.381
Wake up.

01:24:52.117 --> 01:24:53.085
It's okay.

01:24:53.118 --> 01:24:53.653
It's okay.

01:25:21.514 --> 01:25:22.582
Damn waste.

01:25:28.353 --> 01:25:30.289
Where is he?

01:25:30.322 --> 01:25:31.390
He's in there.

01:25:31.423 --> 01:25:32.492
Just keep quiet.

01:25:32.525 --> 01:25:33.593
We have to get out of here.

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:48.273
Oh!

01:25:48.307 --> 01:25:48.775
No.

01:25:48.808 --> 01:25:49.709
I can't.

01:25:50.677 --> 01:25:52.110
Alright, come on.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:55.180
Get in the truck.

01:25:55.213 --> 01:25:56.749
What?

01:25:56.783 --> 01:25:57.517
Get in the truck.

01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:58.551
What?

01:26:15.267 --> 01:26:15.735
What are you doing?

01:26:20.205 --> 01:26:21.908
I'm fuckin' this asshole up.

01:26:21.941 --> 01:26:24.242
No, let's go.

01:26:24.276 --> 01:26:24.777
We go.

01:26:24.811 --> 01:26:26.679
We can go now.

01:26:30.817 --> 01:26:33.519
Mike,
he's not the only one out here.

01:26:36.288 --> 01:26:36.923
Mike.

01:28:09.749 --> 01:28:11.684
Oswald!

01:28:19.859 --> 01:28:20.993
Go on.

01:28:21.027 --> 01:28:21.994
Make a run.

01:28:22.028 --> 01:28:23.563
Go on, I want you to.

01:28:23.596 --> 01:28:24.764
Go on.

01:28:24.797 --> 01:28:28.266
I'll cut you up so small,
my Ox won't even have to chew.

01:28:35.675 --> 01:28:36.709
Oswald!

01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:28.528
Oh, Mike, Mike, Mike.

01:29:34.834 --> 01:29:35.868
I'm sorry.

01:29:38.771 --> 01:29:40.807
Why can't we just go?

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.809
I... I can't do it, I can't.

01:29:46.212 --> 01:29:47.780
Well, you have to go, go on.

01:29:47.814 --> 01:29:49.081
No.

01:29:57.456 --> 01:29:57.990
Sic 'em.

01:30:13.005 --> 01:30:14.040
Oxford.

01:30:32.859 --> 01:30:33.626
Get her.

01:30:45.204 --> 01:30:48.574
Mmhmm, bye-bye.

01:30:48.608 --> 01:30:50.776
You go die.

01:31:08.694 --> 01:31:09.762
Hey, you!

01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:56.475
Waste not, want not.
