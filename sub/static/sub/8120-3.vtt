Good morning, Winnie.

Good morning! Happy anniversary!

00:56.360 --> 00:57.800
Thank you, love.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.240
Do you know, it only
seems like yesterday. I know!

01:00.240 --> 01:03.120
I was behind you as you
walked down that aisle.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.960
And I looked past you

01:04.960 --> 01:07.920
and I could see your Redser
in front of the altar...

01:09.080 --> 01:10.280
..in the coffin.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.080
LAUGHTER

01:12.080 --> 01:13.680
Weren't the flowers beautiful?

01:13.680 --> 01:16.160
Oh, yeah.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.000
I think I'll treat meself this year.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.240
A party? No, a trip away somewhere.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.800
Nowhere grand, you know, just maybe
Galway or the Isle of Man.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.680
Galway Races are on next week.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.560
That's right, Winnie.
I could do that.

01:28.560 --> 01:29.840
DOOR CLOSES

01:29.840 --> 01:32.240
Hiya, Mammy. Hello, son.

01:32.240 --> 01:33.920
How are you, Mrs McGoogan?

01:33.920 --> 01:35.400
Hiya, Rory.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.200
You look very down, love.
What's wrong?

01:38.200 --> 01:40.080
Did Take That break up again?

01:40.080 --> 01:42.760
Oh, Mammy, don't say that!

01:42.760 --> 01:45.320
I'd ride that Gary Barlow.

01:45.320 --> 01:49.960
LAUGHTER

01:51.160 --> 01:53.360
Did I say that out loud? Yes!

01:54.840 --> 01:56.560
It's poor Dino.

01:56.560 --> 01:59.800
He hates living in that hotel
since he lost his bedsit.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.280
Last week you said that you
already had an apartment.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.960
But that's what we thought.

02:03.960 --> 02:07.440
Now the owner is saying
he's not sure if we can have it
for a couple of weeks.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.400
If it's only two weeks,
he can stay here.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.480
With Dermot gone
there's plenty of room.

02:11.480 --> 02:12.840
Really? Yes!

02:12.840 --> 02:14.800
Oh, that'd be fabulous!

02:14.800 --> 02:16.680
Is that the time already?
I'd better go.

02:18.280 --> 02:22.240
And, Rory, tell Dino
I'll do that thing for him.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.640
What's Winnie doing for Dino?

02:25.640 --> 02:29.080
I'm not sure,
I wasn't really listening.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.640
And, Mammy, to thank you

02:30.640 --> 02:33.800
I'm going to do something
really special for ya.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.680
Oh, no, no.
There's no need... Well, yeah...

02:36.680 --> 02:39.160
I'm going to go in
and ring Dino now and tell him.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.720
Do you know,
I knew this was going to happen.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.320
Jimmy Gennochi said it would.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.280
Who the Jesus is Jimmy Gennochi?

02:46.280 --> 02:48.480
The psychic! He's amazing.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.880
I ring his psychic line once a week.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.520
He sees dead people.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.320
LAUGHTER

02:58.680 --> 03:01.360
He sees gobshites with credit cards!

03:01.360 --> 03:03.600
LAUGHTER

03:05.360 --> 03:06.800
Hello.

03:06.800 --> 03:10.120
Is that Saint Mary of the Universe,
Home for the Bewildered?

03:10.120 --> 03:11.800
Sorry, Elderly.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.440
LAUGHTER

03:13.440 --> 03:15.360
Yes. I'm enquiring about the cost of

03:15.360 --> 03:17.360
putting a man in there
for two weeks.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.440
Yes, well, I...

03:20.440 --> 03:21.840
Yes, I'll hold.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.360
DOOR CLOSES

03:23.360 --> 03:25.440
Winnie, I'm on hold.

03:25.440 --> 03:29.360
I'm trying to find somewhere to put
the man that God forgot...

03:29.360 --> 03:31.320
LAUGHTER

03:31.320 --> 03:33.240
..when I have me break.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.440
Put the kettle on.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.000
Hello, yes?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.600
I was speaking to
one of your colleagues...

03:39.600 --> 03:40.880
LAUGHTER

03:40.880 --> 03:43.360
Yes, concerning
the financial...

03:43.360 --> 03:45.040
Yes, I'll hold.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.840
Spend me feckin' day on hold!

03:48.960 --> 03:50.880
Hello, yes.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.200
Well, no, what I was trying to...
How long am I on hold?

03:54.200 --> 03:55.520
Well, let me see...

03:55.520 --> 03:58.320
I was ringing about putting
somebody into your home.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.880
But actually, I've been so long
on hold he's fuckin' dead!

04:00.880 --> 04:03.040
LAUGHTER

04:03.040 --> 04:05.720
APPLAUSE

04:10.000 --> 04:12.360
That's the fourth home
I've called this morning.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.640
I can't believe
the prices they're charging.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.280
For that kind of money,

04:16.280 --> 04:18.560
he can go to Galway,
I'll stay in the buckin' home.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.800
LAUGHTER

04:19.800 --> 04:22.080
Why? How much? Too much!

04:23.120 --> 04:25.000
I'll never get away
for this feckin' trip!

04:25.000 --> 04:28.720
Of course you will!
Someone will take him for two weeks.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.000
LAUGHTER

04:32.000 --> 04:33.480
Not me!

04:33.480 --> 04:37.200
I mean, I would, but Jacko could come
out of hospital any day, Agnes.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.920
Of course he could.

04:38.920 --> 04:40.720
LAUGHTER

04:42.280 --> 04:44.680
I can't believe
the price they charge.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.120
You know, the Heaven's Gate home
is cheap.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.960
But that's because they found
Legionnaires disease there.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.240
Did they?

04:51.240 --> 04:53.440
Grandad, pack your feckin' bags!

04:53.440 --> 04:55.200
LAUGHTER

04:55.200 --> 04:57.040
It's Bonanza Construction!

04:58.440 --> 04:59.800
What do you want?

04:59.800 --> 05:03.280
Right, Mrs Brown, it's time to
pick your sink and your taps.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.920
Am I on some kind of budget here?

05:04.920 --> 05:08.200
Doesn't matter what the price says,
you pick out whichever one you want.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.000
Oooh.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.240
Oh, I like that one.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.280
No, not that one.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.120
That's a nice one.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.840
No, they're very unreliable.

05:16.840 --> 05:18.520
An unreliable sink?

05:18.520 --> 05:20.840
Well, you wouldn't want
an unreliable sink.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.160
No, you wouldn't.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.040
LAUGHTER

05:26.040 --> 05:27.680
What about that one?

05:27.680 --> 05:29.440
No. That one?

05:29.440 --> 05:30.640
Nah.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.880
That one?

05:32.880 --> 05:34.240
What about that one?

05:34.240 --> 05:38.280
Now, you'd think that one was good,
but they suffer from tin worm.

05:38.280 --> 05:42.000
LAUGHTER

05:42.000 --> 05:43.360
Tin worm.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.400
Which one would you recommend?

05:46.400 --> 05:48.400
Well, now, it's up to you.
Keep looking.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.440
What about this one here?

05:52.440 --> 05:55.080
The one with the big red circle
round it and the X beside it?

05:55.080 --> 05:56.280
LAUGHTER

05:56.280 --> 05:57.720
Great choice!

06:00.320 --> 06:02.600
Right, Buffalo Bill,
unload the sink.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.600
You'll like it, Mrs Brown,
it's a lovely sink.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.960
Fine. I'm sure it will be fine.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.560
I'll tell Billy the Kid,
the plumber.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.120
When are you going to
start this job?

06:10.120 --> 06:12.360
Well, I have Jesse James
the spark starting Friday.

06:12.360 --> 06:15.400
And we'll be in to do the wiring
first thing on Monday. I'll see ya.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.240
Jesse James?
They're all very peculiar names!

06:18.240 --> 06:20.560
There's a lot of cowboys in this
business, Mrs Brown.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.880
LAUGHTER

06:21.880 --> 06:23.240
Yee-ha!

06:26.040 --> 06:28.480
I can't believe
he did that fuckin' joke!

06:28.480 --> 06:30.000
LAUGHTER

06:30.000 --> 06:32.880
You know, it's a pity Dr Flynn
can't sort something out

06:32.880 --> 06:34.560
for Grandad for a couple of weeks.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.000
Jesus, Winnie, you might
have something there.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.960
I think I need to call me a doctor!

06:44.280 --> 06:46.760
LAUGHTER

06:48.800 --> 06:51.240
And I've been very tired
in the mornings, you know?

06:51.240 --> 06:53.360
What with looking after Grandad.

06:53.360 --> 06:57.240
Patient, Agnes Brown.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.400
Age?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.360
Fine.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.360
Everybody needs a break, I suppose.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.480
Especially when you're
looking after Grandad.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.880
Weight? 145 pounds.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.640
That's cos I'm run down,
you know, looking after Grandad.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.520
175 pounds.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.920

07:18.560 --> 07:19.800

07:21.240 --> 07:24.920
LAUGHTER

07:24.920 --> 07:27.200

07:27.200 --> 07:30.000
I do shrink in me sleep,
that's cos of the stress.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.640
Grandad.

07:31.640 --> 07:33.760
I need to take your pressure,
Mrs Brown.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.520
I knew this was coming.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.280
You see, what I think...

07:37.280 --> 07:39.520
LAUGHTER

07:45.360 --> 07:46.640
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.360
What I could really do with is
Grandad going into hospital for

07:49.360 --> 07:50.880
a couple of weeks' respite care.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.160
Respite care's only given
to the really needy.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.840
I'm really needy.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.920
I'm really needy of a weeky breaky.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.280
LAUGHTER

07:59.280 --> 08:01.800
Your blood pressure's quite high.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.480
Are you surprised? I was tall
and slim before you got here.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.560
Now I'm a fat fuckin' midget!

08:08.560 --> 08:10.040
LAUGHTER

08:10.040 --> 08:12.080
I'll give you something
to take that down.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.320
What I really need is a holiday,
away from Grandad.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.520
Mrs Brown, the department would
come out and test Grandad.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.640
They'd see that he doesn't
need special care.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.120
What kind of tests?

08:22.120 --> 08:24.520
Well, they test him for dementia...

08:24.520 --> 08:27.840
Dementia, that's the one!
Get them down to test him.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.480
But he's not demented.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.400
Get them down to test him!

08:31.400 --> 08:32.920
LAUGHTER

08:32.920 --> 08:36.280
Fine, but I'm telling you now,

08:36.280 --> 08:38.720
he won't qualify.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.840
You leave that to me, Doctor.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.880
By the time they get here,
he'll be as mad as a fuckin' brush.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.240
LAUGHTER

08:46.240 --> 08:48.800
APPLAUSE

08:48.800 --> 08:50.080
We're here!

08:50.080 --> 08:51.640
Hello, boys.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.360
Oh, Mrs Brown, thanks very much
for allowing me to stay.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.760
No problem, Dino. I didn't know
you were homeless.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.640
If I'd known, I would have
invited you a lot sooner.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.000
Aw!

09:01.000 --> 09:02.440
Dino!

09:03.840 --> 09:05.760
Oh, Rory!

09:05.760 --> 09:07.600
Oh, Dino!

09:07.600 --> 09:09.760
Oh, Jesus!

LAUGHTER

09:16.440 --> 09:18.560
LAUGHTER

09:24.920 --> 09:26.080

09:26.080 --> 09:29.000
Good morning, Mrs Brown!

09:29.000 --> 09:30.520
What's all this?

09:30.520 --> 09:32.520
I've prepared a little
breakfast for you.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.920
You've a long day ahead,
so I thought I'd treat you.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.440
Breakfast for me?

09:36.440 --> 09:39.560
I haven't had breakfast
cooked for me...ever!

09:39.560 --> 09:41.800
Well, today's the day.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.800
Sit yourself down, now.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.040
Thank you very much, son.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.040
What's this shit?

09:50.040 --> 09:52.040
LAUGHTER

09:52.040 --> 09:53.800
I mean...what is this?

09:53.800 --> 09:55.680
It's Eggs Florentine.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.720
A lightly poached egg
with creamed spinach

09:57.720 --> 10:01.040
and a hollandaise sauce
on a grilled crouton.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.400
Toast.

10:02.400 --> 10:03.600
LAUGHTER

10:03.600 --> 10:05.800
Very good! Toast.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.040
DINO LAUGHS

10:07.040 --> 10:08.720
Right, I'm off.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.400

LAUGHTER

10:19.240 --> 10:20.520

10:20.520 --> 10:22.280
You just missed Heston Blumenthal.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.360
LAUGHTER

10:23.360 --> 10:26.600
Ah, Mammy, Dino's just
trying to be nice.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.920
I appreciate that,
but this is my kitchen.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.160
Let him be feckin' nice
somewhere else.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.880
Do you want a cup of tea, love?

10:32.880 --> 10:34.560
With a crouton?

10:34.560 --> 10:35.920
Just tea.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.280
Did you sleep all right, love?

10:37.280 --> 10:39.720
Oh, yeah...lovely!

10:39.720 --> 10:41.800
Will you tell Dino
to stop making that bed?

10:41.800 --> 10:43.520
My God, you'd think
he never slept in it.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.680
LAUGHTER

10:45.680 --> 10:46.800
Morning.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.360
Morning, Mrs McGoogan.

10:48.360 --> 10:52.840
Rory, tell Dino I'll be there
on time. Six o'clock.

10:52.840 --> 10:56.040
Er, yeah, right, I'll tell him.
I'd better be off. Bye!

10:56.040 --> 10:58.360
What about your feckin' tea?

10:58.360 --> 11:00.400
Winnie, get yourself tea,
will you? All right.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.240
I have to get Grandad
ready for his test.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.080
What test?

11:05.080 --> 11:07.600
The tester's coming
to test him for the home.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.040
It's like a quiz.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.640
Oh, I love quizzes.

11:10.640 --> 11:11.840
That's nice.

11:11.840 --> 11:14.160
LAUGHTER

11:14.160 --> 11:17.800
Now, Grandad, when the tester
gets here tomorrow

11:17.800 --> 11:20.040
and he asks you a question,
what have you to do?

11:20.040 --> 11:21.720
Get right answers.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.680
Is correct. And if you get
the wrong answers, he'll...

11:24.680 --> 11:26.120
Shoot me?

11:26.120 --> 11:27.320
LAUGHTER

11:27.320 --> 11:28.560
With a big gun!

11:30.160 --> 11:33.280
Now, I've asked around and the
first question they always ask is,

11:33.280 --> 11:35.200
"What is the highest
mountain in the world?"

11:35.200 --> 11:36.320
Everest.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.160
No, it's the Amazon!

11:39.160 --> 11:41.120
The Amazon's a river!

11:42.120 --> 11:44.560
LAUGHTER

11:44.560 --> 11:46.720
Look how confused you are!

11:46.720 --> 11:48.520
Why don't I ask Winnie?

11:48.520 --> 11:50.920
Winnie, what's the tallest
mountain in the world?

11:50.920 --> 11:52.440
What you said it was, Agnes.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.800
That's right!

11:54.960 --> 11:58.040
Now, Grandad, question two -

11:58.040 --> 12:01.040
"What singer is famous
for the moonwalk?'"

12:01.040 --> 12:02.360
Michael Jackson.

12:02.360 --> 12:03.560
LAUGHTER

12:03.560 --> 12:06.840
Neil Armstrong! Winnie?

12:06.840 --> 12:08.640
Neil Armstrong.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.120
Neil Armstrong.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.040
Oh, right answer!

12:13.040 --> 12:14.880
There you go. Yum, yum, yum.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.880
And the prize?

12:17.880 --> 12:19.840
A week in Galway for me!

12:20.920 --> 12:22.960
LAUGHTER

12:22.960 --> 12:25.080
APPLAUSE

12:29.680 --> 12:31.320
Here we go, Mrs Brown.

12:31.320 --> 12:34.280
A cider for you and a gin
and tonic for Mrs McGoogan.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.720
Winnie, where is she?

12:35.720 --> 12:38.360
She's on her way.
Oh, she was a fantastic model.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.640
Model? What do you mean, model?

12:40.640 --> 12:44.160
In the hairdressing competition.
Winnie was my model.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.120
It's a pity Rory wasn't in it.
I could have been his model.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.040
Oh, he was, Mrs Brown.
And he did have a model.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.200
LAUGHTER

12:57.960 --> 13:01.560
Jesus, I hope Winnie doesn't end up
looking like a feckin' badger.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.200
LAUGHTER

13:07.880 --> 13:10.400
Winnie's after finding
a fuckin' nest!

13:11.800 --> 13:13.880
So, where did you
park your motorbike?

13:15.120 --> 13:17.640
It looks like you've combed it up
from under your arms.

13:17.640 --> 13:18.720
LAUGHTER

13:18.720 --> 13:21.040
Agnes, darling.

13:21.040 --> 13:24.160
Well, what do you think?

13:25.560 --> 13:28.520
I've seen better hairstyles
on an elephant's testicles.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.080
LAUGHTER

13:30.080 --> 13:31.440
How are ya, Mammy?

13:32.840 --> 13:34.560
AUDIENCE: Oooh!

13:34.560 --> 13:36.640
So, who won your competition?

13:36.640 --> 13:38.120
Rory did!

13:38.120 --> 13:39.400
Congratulations.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.080
Yes, we did.
Though we weren't up against much.

13:43.360 --> 13:44.920
AUDIENCE: Oooh.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.560
I'll just go
and get us a drink, Dino.

13:49.920 --> 13:52.160
I would have been a good model!

13:52.160 --> 13:53.880
Well, Rory said you didn't qualify.

13:53.880 --> 13:56.040
What do you mean, I didn't qualify?

13:56.040 --> 13:59.720
Well, you probably have to have
a thick growth like mine.

13:59.720 --> 14:03.800
No, the category was
Hairstyles for Seniors.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.600
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

14:08.200 --> 14:11.520
APPLAUSE

14:13.960 --> 14:15.960
Was it, now?

14:18.280 --> 14:20.040
I love you, son.

14:20.040 --> 14:23.000
Oh, thank God. And, Mammy...
Yes, love.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.600
Remember I said I was going to do
something special for you?

14:25.600 --> 14:28.600
Oh, now, you don't...
Well, yes, you did.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.160
Well, Cathy's at home waiting
and so's your surprise!

14:32.160 --> 14:35.320
Well, what are we doing here?
Come on, let's get home!

14:37.920 --> 14:39.360
They're on their way.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.440
I've never taken part in one of
these before, Mr Gennochi.

14:43.440 --> 14:46.080
Cathy, you'll be fine.
You'll be fine.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.360
I wonder how Mammy's
going to take it.

14:48.360 --> 14:51.600
There is nothing frightening
about the spirit world, nothing!

14:51.600 --> 14:54.160
It's not the spirit world
I'm worried about!

14:55.480 --> 14:58.000
I can't wait for this
feckin' surprise!

14:59.800 --> 15:01.360
Shit, we've been robbed!

15:01.360 --> 15:02.840
LAUGHTER

15:02.840 --> 15:06.320
No, Mammy! Remember
the psychic I told you about?

15:06.320 --> 15:08.760
Psychic, my arse! Con man, you mean?

15:08.760 --> 15:10.160
Mammy, he's not a con man.

15:10.160 --> 15:13.200
He's a con man, or a charlatan
or a feckin' nutcase!

15:13.200 --> 15:15.760
And he's...he's in
my fuckin' sitting room!

15:15.760 --> 15:17.960
LAUGHTER

15:19.080 --> 15:20.480
Did he hear me?

15:20.480 --> 15:22.000
We all heard ya!

15:22.000 --> 15:23.840
Why didn't you fuckin' tell me?

15:26.640 --> 15:28.080

15:28.080 --> 15:29.760
LAUGHTER

15:31.360 --> 15:33.240
Aargh, aargh!

15:36.400 --> 15:38.440
Hello, how do you do?

15:40.080 --> 15:42.640
Mrs Brown, I don't know
how much Rory has told you.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.680
Do you not? And you're
supposed to be a psychic!

15:44.680 --> 15:46.520
LAUGHTER

15:46.520 --> 15:48.640
Well, he asked me
to come here tonight to try

15:48.640 --> 15:51.400
and contact
your late husband, Redser.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.800
Not going to happen, love.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.120
Mumbo jumbo, the whole feckin'
lot of it, mumbo jumbo!

15:55.120 --> 15:56.680
That is a shame, Mrs Brown,

15:56.680 --> 15:59.320
because you're much admired
in the spirit world.

15:59.320 --> 16:02.200
Much loved as a mother,
but I won't waste your time.

16:03.360 --> 16:06.480
Well, I mean,
seeing as how you're here,

16:06.480 --> 16:09.120
we could always have a short go.

16:09.120 --> 16:10.280
Are you sure?

16:10.280 --> 16:13.600
Well, I don't want to disappoint
my fans in the spirit world.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.120
Let me dim the lights.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.760
MRS BROWN LAUGHS

16:20.760 --> 16:24.160
It's not the London Palladium, love.
On or off, take your fuckin' pick.

16:24.160 --> 16:25.640
LAUGHTER

16:27.080 --> 16:29.320
Off. Rory, get the lights.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.480
Rory, come to the light.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.960
LAUGHTER

16:42.280 --> 16:43.600
Sorry.

16:43.600 --> 16:48.600
Now, can we all... Please,
can we all just hold hands?

16:51.360 --> 16:53.000
Who's that beside me?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.160
It's me, Agnes.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.400
Agnes, that's not my hand
you're holding.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.040
LAUGHTER

17:07.080 --> 17:11.120
Now, I want us all to close our eyes

17:11.120 --> 17:15.800
and concentrate on those
who are no longer with us.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.240
Close your eyes!

17:22.240 --> 17:23.760
You close your eyes!

17:23.760 --> 17:26.480
I'll close my eyes when you
close yours. Now, close your eyes!

17:26.480 --> 17:28.840
What are you now, the eye inspector?

17:28.840 --> 17:30.160
Close your buckin'...

17:30.160 --> 17:31.600
Aargh!

17:36.440 --> 17:38.520
What the... Is he all right?

17:38.520 --> 17:40.880
Never mind him,
I just wet me knickers!

17:40.880 --> 17:42.680
LAUGHTER

17:42.680 --> 17:46.200
I sense... I sense
a presence in this house.

17:46.200 --> 17:51.040
Somebody who refuses to pass over
to the spirit world.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.800
That's you, Grandad!

17:52.800 --> 17:54.520
LAUGHTER

17:54.520 --> 17:56.960
Mammy! Sorry.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.520
Speak to us.
Is there anyone out there?

17:59.520 --> 18:00.960
Speak to us!

18:00.960 --> 18:02.320
SOMEONE BREAKS WIND

18:02.320 --> 18:04.280
LAUGHTER

18:05.360 --> 18:07.000
That was definitely you, Grandad!

18:08.520 --> 18:11.520
Agnes, it's me!

18:11.520 --> 18:14.360
It's your husband, Redser.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.040
I don't believe it!

18:16.040 --> 18:18.520
Even in the spirit world,
he's pissed!

18:18.520 --> 18:20.120
LAUGHTER

18:20.120 --> 18:22.600
Mammy, don't give him
such a hard time!

18:23.680 --> 18:26.440
Agnes, do you miss me?

18:28.160 --> 18:29.280
Mammy!

18:29.280 --> 18:30.800
I'm fuckin' thinking.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.360
LAUGHTER

18:33.360 --> 18:34.440
I'm off, so...

18:34.440 --> 18:37.040
No, Daddy, don't go.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.760
Who's that? Who's that?

18:38.760 --> 18:42.520
It's your daughter, Cathy.
And Rory's here, as well.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.120
Hiya, Daddy!

18:44.120 --> 18:45.720
Ah, Rory!

18:45.720 --> 18:48.840
Have you found yourself
a nice little wife?

18:48.840 --> 18:50.360
What?

18:51.360 --> 18:54.520
Boyfriend, and his name is Dino.

18:54.520 --> 18:58.640
Ah, good for you, Cathy, and give
my love to the rest of the family.

18:58.640 --> 19:02.840
Give it to Mark and Trevor
and Dermot and Liam...

19:02.840 --> 19:04.360
Who the fuck is Liam?

19:04.360 --> 19:05.880
LAUGHTER

19:05.880 --> 19:09.200
I'd better go now,
but I'll see you soon, Agnes.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.520
Yeah, right, goodbye... Wait!

19:11.520 --> 19:13.120
What do you mean soon? How soon?

19:13.120 --> 19:15.120
Agnes, they're telling me up here

19:15.120 --> 19:18.920
that I'll be reunited
with my loved one

19:18.920 --> 19:22.280
tomorrow night at 11 o'clock.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.320
Tell me this is some kind
of feckin' joke!

19:27.520 --> 19:29.000
I gotta go!

19:31.000 --> 19:32.680
I think he's fuckin' gone!

19:39.200 --> 19:40.600
Hello?

19:40.600 --> 19:42.400
He fuckin' hung up.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.840
LAUGHTER

19:46.160 --> 19:48.000
Did you hear that, Rory?
Did you hear that?

19:48.000 --> 19:51.200
It's terrible! He thought Cathy
was married to Dino!

19:51.200 --> 19:52.600
Not that!

19:52.600 --> 19:54.120
Oh, yeah, right.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.840
But, Mammy, I thought you didn't
believe in any of that stuff.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.400
You're right, I don't.
I don't believe in that crap!

19:59.400 --> 20:00.560
Of course not, Mrs Brown.

20:00.560 --> 20:04.440
I mean, nobody actually believes
you're going to die
at 11 o'clock tomorrow night.

says is true,

I'm going to die in five minutes.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.080

the fuckin' countdown.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.920
LAUGHTER

21:07.920 --> 21:09.840
Probably not going to
die at all, Agnes.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.440
I'm not going to die.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.240
I mean, you're not that old.

21:13.240 --> 21:14.440
I'm not that old.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.360
You seem in good shape.
I'm in great shape.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.880
And Foley's is a safe place to be.
It is a safe place to...

21:18.880 --> 21:20.040
GLASS SHATTERS

21:21.520 --> 21:23.080
Sorry!

21:23.080 --> 21:26.000
You know, I know
I'm not going to die.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.680
Cos if I was going to die, my whole
family would be here tonight.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.120
LAUGHTER

21:31.120 --> 21:33.960
Exactly. How could you possibly die?

21:33.960 --> 21:35.000
Yeah.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.480
Unless from a heart attack or
a stroke, or a brain haemorrhage,

21:38.480 --> 21:40.120
which is basically a stroke.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.360
Winnie!

21:41.360 --> 21:42.880
Sorry!

21:42.880 --> 21:45.200
I'm just making the point
that we never know

21:45.200 --> 21:48.080
when death is going to
tap us on the shoulder.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.240
Or maybe this whole thing
is a big feckin' mistake?

21:50.240 --> 21:51.480
Aargh!

21:52.680 --> 21:53.760
Is she gone?

21:53.760 --> 21:55.680
ALL: No!

21:55.680 --> 21:57.480
Can I have a word with you,
Mrs Brown?

21:57.480 --> 21:59.120
Make it a quick one, son.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.720
LAUGHTER

22:01.720 --> 22:02.960
Winnie, get me a pint.

22:02.960 --> 22:06.120
Well, I'll get you
half a pint, Agnes.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.120
Pint it is.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.560
I just want to thank you
for letting me stay. Fine.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.640
And being so understanding!
Yeah, whatever.

22:16.640 --> 22:20.200
And, Dino, you don't have to
make that bed every day, really.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.040
It looks like
you haven't even slept in it.

22:23.400 --> 22:24.560
I haven't.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.200
What do you mean?
Where do you sleep?

22:26.200 --> 22:27.680
In Rory's bed.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.840
And where does Rory sleep?

22:30.200 --> 22:32.760
In Rory's bed. We sleep together.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.080
LAUGHTER

22:35.080 --> 22:36.160
Aargh!

22:36.160 --> 22:38.120
PEOPLE GASP

22:38.120 --> 22:39.400
I'm fine.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.240
ALL: Oh, for fuck's sake!

22:41.240 --> 22:43.080
It's just a shock, I'm fine.

22:44.240 --> 22:45.960
Where's the body?

22:45.960 --> 22:47.000
Too early!

22:47.000 --> 22:49.560
LAUGHTER

22:49.560 --> 22:52.960
CLOCK CHIMES

22:56.920 --> 22:58.480
LAUGHTER

22:58.480 --> 23:01.800
Please don't take me yet, Lord.

23:01.800 --> 23:04.080
I know this is the time

23:04.080 --> 23:07.360
when Redser is to be reunited
with his loved one.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.800
Aargh!

23:09.800 --> 23:13.160
His loved one! The bastard!

23:13.160 --> 23:15.120
Aargh!

23:16.200 --> 23:18.000
The double bastard!

23:18.000 --> 23:19.440
Aargh!

23:20.480 --> 23:22.960
The triple bastard!

23:22.960 --> 23:24.280
Aargh!

23:24.280 --> 23:25.920
LAUGHTER

23:25.920 --> 23:27.680
Well, that explains Rory!

23:30.040 --> 23:31.400
Crabs?

23:31.400 --> 23:33.120
Yes.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.840
Apparently Mr Foley gave away
the crabs that he didn't sell

23:35.840 --> 23:37.800
during the crab festival.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.640
Seven cases of food poisoning.
Pretty bad, too.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.440
I'm just glad I'm alive.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.640
Come on, let's go and see
Grandad's health inspector.

23:48.640 --> 23:51.720
Be gentle with him,
he tends to get confused.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.600
I'll leave you, Doctor.
Thank you, Doctor.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.240
Thank you, Doctor.
Goodbye, Doctor.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.320
Goodbye, Doctor.
Goodbye, Doctor.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.800
It's like buckin'
Holby City in here.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.120
LAUGHTER

24:02.120 --> 24:03.760
You need not be anxious, Grandad.

24:03.760 --> 24:06.880
Nobody's going to make you
uncomfortable.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.360
I'm glad to hear that,
cos he's been a bit jumpy lately.

24:10.400 --> 24:13.560
Aargh! Alien! It's an alien!

24:13.560 --> 24:15.280
LAUGHTER

24:20.120 --> 24:23.520
Grandad, do you know
who that is behind me?

24:24.680 --> 24:26.120
LAUGHTER

24:26.120 --> 24:27.280
Frankenstein.

24:29.240 --> 24:33.560
You know, this might be better if
I spoke to Grandad without you here.

24:33.560 --> 24:37.040
I'll be upstairs. I have
his bag ready, just in case.

24:40.760 --> 24:42.440
Alien! Alien!

24:42.440 --> 24:44.120
LAUGHTER

24:46.640 --> 24:50.080
Now, Grandad, I just want
you to relax,

24:50.080 --> 24:52.080
while I ask you some questions.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.720
Don't shoot me!

24:54.880 --> 24:57.840
What is the highest
mountain in the world?

24:57.840 --> 24:59.480
I know this one.

25:00.640 --> 25:02.240
The Amazon.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.680
Everest.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.520
No, it's the Amazon.

25:08.760 --> 25:13.760
Grandad, the head of the British
Royal Family is Queen...?

25:13.760 --> 25:15.280
Jemima!

25:15.280 --> 25:17.240
LAUGHTER

25:17.240 --> 25:18.840
Sorry, don't mind me.

25:18.840 --> 25:22.040
Actually, why don't you
sit down and join us?

25:22.040 --> 25:23.840
Oh, thank you.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.480
Now, Grandad,
who is the black singer

25:28.480 --> 25:30.200
famous for the moonwalk?

25:30.200 --> 25:31.360
Jackson.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.680
Neil Armstrong.

25:39.520 --> 25:41.400
Question four...

25:41.400 --> 25:44.160
LAUGHTER

25:44.160 --> 25:46.400
Question 20.

25:47.600 --> 25:52.360
In the Bible, what was the name
of Joseph the carpenter's

25:52.360 --> 25:55.680
very famous, mystical son?

25:57.040 --> 25:59.080
A carpenter, you say?

26:00.400 --> 26:02.560
Mystical son's name.

26:03.800 --> 26:06.000
I have it. Pinocchio!

26:06.000 --> 26:08.240
LAUGHTER

26:14.560 --> 26:15.920
DOOR CLOSES

26:15.920 --> 26:17.240
MRS BROWN LAUGHS

26:18.320 --> 26:20.240
That's him gone for
a couple of weeks!

26:21.640 --> 26:23.120
LAUGHTER

26:23.120 --> 26:25.000
What the fuck are you doing here?

26:25.000 --> 26:28.200
And where's Winnie? I thought
I heard Winnie down here.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.080
Where did you get all that money?

26:31.080 --> 26:33.680
I had a tenner on you to live.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.560
Each way!

26:38.560 --> 26:41.000
LAUGHTER

26:44.920 --> 26:47.960
Do you know, I learn
something new every day.

26:47.960 --> 26:51.880
For instance, you should never
judge anything, never mind a book,

26:51.880 --> 26:54.160
by its cover.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.440
I thought that psychic
was the real thing.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.440
But he's not, I'm alive!

26:59.440 --> 27:02.800
And I thought Rory
was cheating on me with Hillary

27:02.800 --> 27:04.400
and he wasn't.

27:05.680 --> 27:08.200
And the health tester thought
Winnie was off her rocker

27:08.200 --> 27:10.320
and she's not... Well, not much.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.120
LAUGHTER

27:12.120 --> 27:14.280
And gambling is a mug's game.

27:15.440 --> 27:19.040
Right, I'm off for me week
to the Galway Races!

27:20.320 --> 27:22.280
Are you coming or what?

27:24.520 --> 27:26.720
LAUGHTER

27:26.720 --> 27:28.960
APPLAUSE

27:30.280 --> 27:32.560
Good night!

27:32.560 --> 27:36.720
# Say hello to the queen
of Dublin town

27:37.840 --> 27:42.200
# As the best mum of all
She wears the crown

27:44.040 --> 27:47.080
# Mother hen watching all her chicks

27:47.080 --> 27:50.360
# Sassy old lady, full of tricks

27:50.360 --> 27:55.440
# It's a safe bet she'd never let
life get her down

27:56.360 --> 27:59.360
# She's Mrs Brown
Agnes

27:59.360 --> 28:01.880
# That's Mrs Brown
Agnes

28:01.880 --> 28:03.680
# Our Mrs Brown. #
