WEBVTT

00:03.403 --> 00:05.438
- PREVIOUSLY ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING: NEW YORK...</i>

00:05.472 --> 00:06.439
- GOOD JOB.

00:06.473 --> 00:07.640
- I'M ORIGINALLY FROM SWEDEN,

00:07.674 --> 00:09.576
AND I SOLD $1 BILLION DOLLARS
IN REAL ESTATE

00:09.609 --> 00:10.577
SO FAR IN MY CAREER.

00:10.610 --> 00:11.878
WHEE!

00:11.911 --> 00:13.913
- I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
REAL ESTATE RUNS IN MY FAMILY.

00:13.947 --> 00:15.849
MY DAD IS A CHAIRMAN
OF THE LARGEST

00:15.882 --> 00:18.051
REAL ESTATE BROKERAGE FIRM
HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.

00:18.084 --> 00:19.619
UP UNTIL NOW,
I'VE STUDIED REAL ESTATE,

00:19.652 --> 00:20.887
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

00:20.920 --> 00:22.956
I'M PUTTING IT TO USE
AS A FULL-TIME BROKER.

00:22.989 --> 00:25.291
- MICHAEL, I LOST--

00:25.325 --> 00:27.627
I'M--I LOST THE APARTMENT.

00:27.660 --> 00:28.628
- ONE, TWO, STICK.

00:28.661 --> 00:30.730
- I DIDN'T COME
INTO REAL ESTATE

00:30.764 --> 00:32.298
WITH ANY KIND OF HOOK-UP.

00:32.332 --> 00:33.900
OH, MY GOD.

00:33.933 --> 00:37.370
I'VE ENLISTED THE HELP
OF A PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZER.

00:37.404 --> 00:38.705
- HOLD ON, I GOT
TO CHECK IT OUT FIRST.

00:38.738 --> 00:39.939
- IT'S LIKE
RIPPING OFF A BAND-AID.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.207
- SHH.
OH, MY GOD.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.009
YOU GUYS
ARE STRESSING ME OUT.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.012
[upbeat music]

00:46.046 --> 00:47.547
- MY MOTTO IS,

00:47.580 --> 00:52.786
"EXPANSION ALWAYS
IN ALL WAYS."

00:52.819 --> 00:54.154
- I COME FROM
A REAL ESTATE FAMILY,

00:54.187 --> 00:56.389
BUT I GUESS YOU CAN CALL ME
THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.992
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:59.025 --> 01:00.160
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER

01:00.193 --> 01:01.528
IS THAT I WORK HARDER
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.829
- LOOK ME IN THE EYE, MAN.

01:02.862 --> 01:04.864
- YES, I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.444
[cell phone alarm chimes]

01:30.957 --> 01:34.227
- HEY, TONY.
I'M OFF TO WORK.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.368
- HEY.
- HEY.

01:41.401 --> 01:43.103
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- WOW.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.638
- THAT'S FOR ME?
- YES, THIS IS ALL FOR YOU.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.807
NOW THAT ADRIANNA'S
APARTMENT IS DECLUTTERED,

01:47.841 --> 01:49.876
I CAN FINALLY SELL THIS PLACE.

01:49.909 --> 01:52.112
IT'S REALLY HARD
TO ACCURATELY PRICE THIS,

01:52.145 --> 01:55.181
BECAUSE A DUPLEX ON
THE BOULEVARD IS UNHEARD OF,

01:55.215 --> 01:56.516
AND IT'S GOT
WHITE CARRARA MARBLE

01:56.549 --> 01:59.686
AND A DRY-CLEANING RACK.

01:59.719 --> 02:00.920
SO I'M GONNA
START OFF AGGRESSIVE

02:00.954 --> 02:02.389
AND SEE WHERE
THE MARKET TAKES US.

02:02.422 --> 02:04.324
WANT TO GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND RELAX A LITTLE BIT?

02:04.357 --> 02:08.828
AND THEN MAYBE
WE'LL GET LUNCH OR SOMETHING?

02:08.862 --> 02:11.798
- NO, WE HAVE TO STAY.

02:11.831 --> 02:14.267
- OKAY.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.537
ARE YOU BOTH
PLANNING ON STAYING?

02:17.570 --> 02:19.105
- HE'S SAYING HE'S STAYING.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.974
HE'S NOT MOVING.
WE'RE STAYING.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.275
- ULTIMATELY,
IT'S THEIR CHOICE.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.276
IT'S THEIR APARTMENT.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.978
I MEAN,
WHAT ELSE AM I GONNA DO?

02:25.078 --> 02:28.815
[doorbell rings]

02:28.848 --> 02:30.316
- HELLO.
- HOW ARE YOU?

02:30.350 --> 02:31.718
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:31.751 --> 02:32.919
- RYAN.
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

02:32.952 --> 02:34.788
BASICALLY, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW THE "J" LINE

02:34.821 --> 02:35.989
IN THE BUILDING AT ALL.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.391
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S A TWO BEDROOM, TWO BATH.

02:38.425 --> 02:39.826
SO THERE'S TWO FULL BATHROOMS,

02:39.859 --> 02:41.294
AND THE MASTER BEDROOM
ON THIS FLOOR.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.130
THIS CREATES A BIG,
OPEN ENTERTAINING SPACE.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.632
UNBELIEVABLE.

02:45.665 --> 02:46.900
BEFORE I CAN EVEN
START MY PITCH,

02:46.933 --> 02:48.968
ADRIANNA HAS
SNUCK IN BEHIND ME,

02:49.002 --> 02:51.771
AND IS JUST HOVERING
IN THE SAME ROOM.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.640
JUST...LURKING.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.275
AWKWARD.

02:55.308 --> 02:56.343
ALL RIGHT.
- BEAUTIFUL.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.678
- SHOW YOU
THE MASTER BEDROOM.

02:58.712 --> 02:59.679
MASTER BEDROOM?

02:59.713 --> 03:01.414
- OH.
- HI. I'M ADRIANNA.

03:01.448 --> 03:02.716
- ADRIANNA, TAMARA LAVILLE.

03:02.749 --> 03:05.518
NICE TO MEET YOU.
- PLEASURE.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.056
- WELL,
I LIKE WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

03:10.056 --> 03:12.892
- THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.260
- ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD, RYAN.

03:14.294 --> 03:16.629
- ALL RIGHT. AND THEN THIS
IS KIND OF A COOL FEATURE.

03:16.663 --> 03:18.131
[grunts]

03:18.164 --> 03:19.899
AND I THINK...

03:19.933 --> 03:22.168
SHE LOCKED THESE.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.270
I THINK
SHE LOCKED THE CLOSETS.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.605
- IT'S A WALK-IN CLOSET.

03:25.638 --> 03:27.440
- YEAH, IT'S A WALK-IN CLOSET
THAT GOES AROUND.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.409
HOLD ON ONE SECOND FOR ME.

03:29.442 --> 03:32.612
ADRIANNA?
DID YOU LOCK YOUR CLOSET?

03:38.151 --> 03:39.185
THAT'S COOL.
THAT'S COOL.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.186
NO WORRIES.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.088
SO THIS, TAMARA--

03:42.088 --> 03:43.857
SO I CAN'T REALLY
SHOW YOU WHAT'S IN HERE,

03:43.890 --> 03:45.458
BUT IT'S A BIG--
IT'S A WALK-IN CLOSET,

03:45.492 --> 03:47.460
AND IT'S GOT A DRY-CLEANING
RACK THAT GOES AROUND.

03:47.494 --> 03:49.896
- OH, I'M SO DISAPPOINTED
I CAN'T SEE THAT.

03:49.929 --> 03:50.897
- I KNOW.

03:50.930 --> 03:52.165
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

03:52.198 --> 03:54.100
THIS CLOSET IS THE KEY FEATURE
OF THIS APARTMENT

03:54.134 --> 03:55.468
FOR ANY WOMAN
THAT COMES AND SEES IT,

03:55.502 --> 03:57.370
AND NOW ADRIANNA'S
DENYING ACCESS?

03:57.404 --> 03:59.873
CAN I GET YOU ANY SAKI
OR ANY WATER OR SUSHI?

03:59.906 --> 04:02.208
- UH, LITTLE EARLY
IN THE DAY FOR SAKI.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.410
- LITTLE EARLY?
WHO SAYS THAT?

04:03.443 --> 04:04.811
IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY FOR SAKI.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.079
SO WHAT'D YOU THINK?

04:06.112 --> 04:08.882
- I THOUGHT IT WAS
A LITTLE OVERPRICED.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.183
- REALLY?

04:10.216 --> 04:11.851
- I REALLY THINK
THAT YOU NEED TO BE IN

04:11.885 --> 04:15.755
AT UNDER 4 MILLION IF YOU WANT
TO MOVE THIS QUICKLY.

04:15.789 --> 04:16.756
- YOU CAN'T GET THROWN OFF

04:16.790 --> 04:18.224
BY THE FIRST SHOWING
OF AN APARTMENT,

04:18.258 --> 04:21.194
BUT STILL THIS IS NOT
A GOOD START.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.510
- WELL, WHAT WE GOT, MARK?

04:37.544 --> 04:39.612
- ALL RIGHT, MIGUEL, I'VE GOT
SOME AWESOME STUFF TODAY.

04:39.646 --> 04:42.982
- I GUESS I'M QUITE
A CLOTHESHORSE.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.719
MY TAILOR TAKES PICTURES OF
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO WEAR A LOT,

04:45.752 --> 04:47.087
MIX AND MATCH STUFF FOR ME,

04:47.087 --> 04:48.355
BECAUSE I HATE
DOING IT MYSELF.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.256
IT'S A HUGE TIME-SAVER
FOR ME IN THE MORNING.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.892
I COULD JUST GRAB A PICTURE.
I KNOW I HAVE TO WEAR THIS.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.761
I GET DRESSED, BOOM,
OUT THE DOOR.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.731
PEOPLE SAY I DRESS
LIKE A 60-YEAR-OLD MAN.

04:57.764 --> 04:59.366
I ACCEPT IT.
I OWN IT.

04:59.399 --> 05:00.867
HEY, TREVOR.
HOW ARE YOU?

05:00.900 --> 05:02.802
TREVOR HAS BEEN
A REAL ESTATE POWERHOUSE

05:02.836 --> 05:04.804
IN NEW YORK
FOR 20 YEARS OR SO.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.040
YEAH, NO, NO, I'M VERY
FAMILIAR WITH 1055 PARK.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.608
I'VE BEEN WATCHING IT
COME OUT OF THE GROUND.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.110
I LOVE THAT BUILDING.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.678
I'VE REALLY BEEN
PURSUING TREVOR

05:11.711 --> 05:13.813
TO HELP SELL HIS UNITS
ON PARK AVENUE,

05:13.847 --> 05:15.648
SO I'M REALLY EXCITED
TO FINALLY HEAR FROM HIM.

05:15.682 --> 05:18.351
AND ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE I'M
A RELATIVELY NEW BROKER,

05:18.385 --> 05:21.254
AND HIS PROJECTS
ARE VERY PRESTIGIOUS.

05:21.287 --> 05:22.756
YEAH, NO, I'D LOVE
TO COME TAKE A LOOK.

05:22.789 --> 05:25.158
YOU TELL ME WHEN.
I CAN BE THERE ANY TIME.

05:25.191 --> 05:26.793
LATER TODAY'S FINE.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.069
- HELLO?

05:36.069 --> 05:37.604
- HI, CLAUDIA.
FREDRIK HERE.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.506
SO TODAY I HAVE
A LISTING APPOINTMENT

05:39.539 --> 05:42.208
WITH TWO FORMER CLIENTS,
CLAUDIA AND MICHAEL.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.811
THEY HAVE A BEAUTIFUL,
UPSCALE LOFT IN SOHO,

05:44.844 --> 05:47.714
AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING MORE FAMILY ORIENTED.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.482
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
I SOLD ONE OF CLAUDIA'S

05:49.516 --> 05:51.951
PRIOR APARTMENTS
FOR A RECORD-BREAKING PRICE.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.287
NOW I'M HOPING TO DO THE SAME
WITH THIS ONE.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.456
I'M 15 MINUTES AWAY.
- OKAY.

05:56.489 --> 05:59.159
- SOHO HAS THE BEST SHOPPING
ANYWHERE IN NEW YORK CITY.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.493
AND IT'S SO INTERESTING.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.128
YOU'RE STANDING THERE
ON THE COBBLESTONE STREET,

06:02.162 --> 06:04.130
AND YOU SEE ALL THESE
RETAIL AROUND YOU.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.398
THEN YOU LOOK UP,

06:05.432 --> 06:08.768
AND YOU WOULD NEVER EXPECT
THAT BEHIND THESE OLD,

06:08.802 --> 06:11.204
HISTORIC, CAST-IRON FACADES

06:11.237 --> 06:14.107
ARE AMAZING
RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.843
HUGE LOFTS.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.812
HI, LOVE.
HOW ARE YOU?

06:18.845 --> 06:19.813
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

06:19.846 --> 06:20.814
- NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.816
- YOU LOOK GREAT.
- LIKEWISE.

06:22.849 --> 06:24.384
- HI, GIRLS.

06:24.417 --> 06:25.385
- WOW.

06:25.418 --> 06:26.519
- I GOT SOME DOLLS FOR YOU.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.689
- WOW. DID YOU GET
MY GIRLS BUSTY DOLLS?

06:29.723 --> 06:31.057
- I WAS PLAYING WITH--

06:31.091 --> 06:33.727
I WAS PLAYING WITH DOLLS
TOO WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.128
OF COURSE CLAUDIA
GETS ANGRY AT ME,

06:35.161 --> 06:36.730
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT ALWAYS HELPS
TO BRING SOMETHING

06:36.763 --> 06:38.064
TO GET A LISTING.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.165
YOU KNOW, A LITTLE GIFT.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.935
WOW. HOLY MOLEY.
THE SIZE OF THIS.

06:41.968 --> 06:44.170
- COME ON IN.

07:15.935 --> 07:16.936
- LET'S GET TO THE POINT HERE.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.071
WHAT IS THE PRICE?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.072
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:19.105 --> 07:20.106
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.441
I MEAN,
IT'S TRULY, TRULY UNIQUE.

07:21.474 --> 07:23.610
HOWEVER, IT'S A LITTLE WORRYING
TO ME, THIS KITCHEN.

07:23.643 --> 07:25.211
- ALL RIGHT,
SO IT'S A LITTLE DATED,

07:25.245 --> 07:26.946
BUT I JUST GOT BACK
FROM ITALY,

07:27.047 --> 07:28.848
AND I SAW THE KITCHEN
THAT I WANT.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.418
- SOME PEOPLE
MIGHT LIKE THAT KITCHEN.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.053
I HATE IT.
IT'S IN METAL.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.287
IT FEELS REALLY DATED.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.556
IT'S, LIKE, TEN YEARS OLD.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.591
IN THIS MARKET,
PEOPLE WHO BUY A LOT

07:38.625 --> 07:41.127
WILL EXPECT
3-INCH THICK MARBLE,

07:41.161 --> 07:43.930
BEAUTIFUL,
CUSTOM-MADE CABINETS.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.398
SOMETHING MORE DRAMATIC.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.200
THIS IS THE HEART
OF THE APARTMENT.

07:47.233 --> 07:48.702
I HAVE--I HAVE A PRICE
IN MIND, YOU KNOW?

07:48.735 --> 07:50.637
WITH A NEW KITCHEN,

07:50.670 --> 07:52.472
I THINK 6 MILLION
IS THE PRICE THAT WE SHOULD GO.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.240
TO THE MARKET PRICES.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.513
- I DON'T THINK WE'RE
DOING ANYTHING FOR 6 MILLION.

08:00.547 --> 08:03.016
- I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GETTING
US OUT OF HERE FOR THAT.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.651
- SO WHAT IS YOUR NUMBER?

08:04.684 --> 08:06.019
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:06.052 --> 08:08.021
I DON'T THINK WE'D TAKE
ANYTHING LESS THAN SEVEN.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.090
- 7 MILLION.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.491
- YOU GOT US THAT
IN OUR OTHER PLACE.

08:11.524 --> 08:12.859
- YEAH, BUT IT HAD
A BEAUTIFUL KITCHEN.

08:12.892 --> 08:14.294
IT HAD BRAND NEW BATHROOMS.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.597
THAT TUB FOR, LIKE, $60,000
THAT YOU IMPORTED FROM TURKEY.

08:17.630 --> 08:21.234
I THINK THE BUYERS LOOKING
IN SOHO FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

08:21.267 --> 08:22.402
IT'S GONNA BE A CHALLENGE,

08:22.435 --> 08:25.271
BECAUSE AT SIX,
WE'RE LOOKING AT 1,350 A FOOT.

08:25.305 --> 08:29.109
AT SEVEN,
WE'RE OVER $1,500 A FOOT.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.577
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I SORT OF RESENT THAT,

08:30.610 --> 08:33.580
BECAUSE EVERYBODY ALWAYS HAS
TO DO THE SQUARE FOOTAGE THING.

08:33.613 --> 08:37.150
MOST LOFTS IN SOHO
ARE LONG AND NARROW,

08:37.183 --> 08:40.620
AND, UM, THIS TYPE OF LAY
YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE.

08:40.653 --> 08:42.555
THE MONEY THAT WENT
INTO THIS PLACE--

08:42.589 --> 08:43.790
THERE'S A HALF A MILLION
DOLLARS

08:43.823 --> 08:45.191
IN JUST AUDIO EQUIPMENT
HERE, SO--

08:45.225 --> 08:46.593
- OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THIS?

08:46.626 --> 08:49.095
LET ME TRY TO SELL YOU THE
6 MILLION IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.363
INSTEAD OF HAVING--

08:50.397 --> 08:52.065
- 6 MILL--
IT AIN'T GOING FOR 6 MILLION.

08:52.098 --> 08:53.900
- OKAY, LET ME TRY.
LET ME TRY. LET ME TRY.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.702
INSTEAD OF HAVING IT SIT
ON THE MARKET AT SEVEN

08:55.735 --> 08:56.803
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME,

08:56.836 --> 08:58.371
YOU TAKE THE 6 MILLION NOW,

08:58.405 --> 09:01.007
YOU ADD UP WHAT I SOLD
YOUR PREVIOUS LOFT FOR,

09:01.007 --> 09:02.442
YOU ADD ALL THAT MONEY UP,

09:02.475 --> 09:04.010
AND YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL
THAT MONEY IN THE MARKET NOW.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.478
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

09:05.512 --> 09:07.547
FIRST OF ALL, DON'T TELL ME
HOW TO INVEST MY MONEY.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.884
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T DO THAT.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.053
- OH, MY.
THIS IS GETTING FEISTY.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.188
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS
GONNA WANT TO NEGOTIATE,

09:15.221 --> 09:17.424
SO WE BASICALLY HAVE
TO GO AT 7 1/2 MILLION

09:17.457 --> 09:19.159
TO GET SEVEN,
WHICH HURTS ME EVEN MORE.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.061
- NO, 7 MILLION
IS THE NUMBER,

09:21.094 --> 09:24.764
AND THAT'S THE NUMBER
THAT I WANT.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.733
- OKAY, GUYS,
I WORK FOR YOU.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.335
I'M VERY LOYAL TO YOU.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.904
I'LL WORK TIRELESSLY
TO GET YOU THE MAXIMUM PRICE.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.038
- YES.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.306
- AND THAT'S
MY COMMITMENT TO YOU.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.275
YOUR COMMITMENT TO ME
IS A NEW KITCHEN.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.676
- MM-HMM.
- DING.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.211
- ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S FAIR. THAT'S FAIR.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.312
- I MEAN,
I'M NOT A MAGICIAN,

09:39.346 --> 09:40.847
BUT I'M GONNA FIND
THE RIGHT BUYER.

09:40.880 --> 09:41.848
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP.

09:41.881 --> 09:43.049
AND THEN, IN THE END,

09:43.049 --> 09:45.385
WHEN I GET AN OFFER
FOR, LIKE, 6.5,

09:45.418 --> 09:46.453
THAT'S WHEN I'M GONNA...

09:46.486 --> 09:48.054
[imitates gunshot]
WITH CLAUDIA.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.156
OKAY, LET'S SIGN
THE EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.792
AND IT'S A 6% COMMISSION.

09:52.826 --> 09:57.664
- YOU GET THE PRICE,
YOU GET THE COMMISSION.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.066
- WE NEED TO DROP THE PRICE.

10:00.066 --> 10:01.601
- YOU JUST WANT ME
TO MAKE YOUR JOB EASIER.

10:01.634 --> 10:12.379
WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST WORK HARDER?

10:12.412 --> 10:17.751
WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST WORK HARDER?

10:17.784 --> 10:19.652
- HEY. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

10:19.686 --> 10:20.854
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?
- HOW ARE YOU?

10:20.887 --> 10:22.122
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.123
- THIS IS MIGUEL,
MY CLIENT.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.124
- HI.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.125
- MIGUEL.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.126
- MIGUEL, YES.
THIS IS LANA.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.028
- HI. LANA.
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

10:28.061 --> 10:29.763
TWO FRENCH BROKERS,
LOIC AND OLIVIER

10:29.796 --> 10:31.231
HAVE CLIENTS FROM PARIS,

10:31.264 --> 10:33.533
AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AN
APARTMENT IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.835
NOW THIS IS PENTHOUSE
3J AND 4J

10:35.869 --> 10:37.370
THAT WERE COMBINED
TO CREATE A DUPLEX.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.639
SO THIS IS KIND OF
THE ENTERTAINING FLOOR.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.974
THEY RAISED THE CEILINGS,

10:41.007 --> 10:43.243
THEY DID THE VENETIAN PLASTER
ALL ALONG THE WALL.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.045
KIND OF MADE THIS
AN ENTERTAINMENT CENTER.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.312
AND THEN THEY OPENED THIS UP,

10:46.346 --> 10:47.981
SO WHEN YOU WALK DOWN,
EVERYTHING'S WHITE,

10:48.014 --> 10:48.982
EVERYTHING'S BRIGHT.

10:49.015 --> 10:49.983
THIS IS VERY UNIQUE.

10:50.016 --> 10:53.453
- [speaking French]

10:57.257 --> 10:58.625
- DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT--

10:58.658 --> 11:00.326
- [speaking French]

11:02.829 --> 11:04.698
- AND THEN YOU HAVE
THE DRESSING ROOM AREA THERE,

11:04.731 --> 11:07.167
AND THEN A FULL SUITE BATH.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.602
- [speaking French]

11:09.636 --> 11:11.604
- I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA

11:11.638 --> 11:13.139
WHAT THEY THINK
ABOUT THIS APARTMENT.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.674
I MEAN, EVEN
THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS

11:14.708 --> 11:16.076
ARE SPEAKING FRENCH.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.078
- [speaking French]

11:18.111 --> 11:20.513
- AFTER YOU.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.485
YOU HEAR THE STEREOTYPES
ABOUT FRENCH PEOPLE

11:25.518 --> 11:28.088
THAT THEY'RE RUDE OR ARROGANT
TOWARDS AMERICANS,

11:28.088 --> 11:29.289
WHICH IS TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.257
TOTALLY,
TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.859
THEY'RE JUST
THAT WAY TOWARDS ME.

11:32.892 --> 11:37.664
- [speaking French]

11:37.697 --> 11:39.265
- WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

11:39.299 --> 11:42.569
SURE.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.270
- BUT THE--

11:44.304 --> 11:46.906
FEW THINGS TO CHANGE.

11:46.940 --> 11:52.312
- ABOUT THE PRICE?

11:52.345 --> 11:54.014
OKAY.
- SO WE'LL--

11:54.114 --> 11:55.782
- SO YOU CAN MAKE ME AN OFFER.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.454
HOPEFULLY THESE PEOPLE
WILL COME BACK WITH AN OFFER,

12:01.488 --> 12:03.356
BUT, HONESTLY,
WITH THE FEEDBACK I'M GETTING,

12:03.390 --> 12:05.825
I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME
TO REDUCE THE PRICE.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.360
SO I'LL SEE YOU OUT
THIS WAY.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.771
- LET'S GO TO
CANAL AND GREENWICH.

12:17.804 --> 12:18.872
- OKAY.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.540
- THAT NEW SITE
THAT I'M LOOKING AT.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.476
[cell phone rings]
FREDRIK SPEAKING.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.446
HI, CLAUDIA.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.082
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU
FOR A WHILE.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.785
ARE YOU STANDING
IN YOUR NEW KITCHEN?

12:42.595 --> 12:44.531
WHAT--WHAT ABOUT THE PRICE,
THOUGH?

12:44.564 --> 12:45.932
BECAUSE IF THE KITCHEN
ISN'T DONE,

12:45.965 --> 12:48.902
YOU KNOW,
7 MILLION IS A LOT.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.808
IT'S VERY, VERY URGENT
SHE GETS A NEW KITCHEN,

12:54.841 --> 12:56.109
AND, ACTUALLY, IN MY WORLD,

12:56.109 --> 12:57.110
GET THE KITCHEN OUT.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.244
I'D RATHER SELL THAT APARTMENT

12:58.278 --> 13:00.246
WITH A HOLE IN THE GROUND
FOR THE KITCHEN

13:00.280 --> 13:01.781
AND SHOWING THEM
BEAUTIFUL VISUALS

13:01.815 --> 13:03.049
OF WHAT THE NEW, BEAUTIFUL,

13:03.083 --> 13:05.151
CUSTOM-MADE KITCHEN
IS GONNA LOOK LIKE.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.492
OKAY, LOVE.
I WORK FOR YOU AND NOBODY ELSE.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.661
I'M GONNA SELL THE APARTMENT.

13:14.694 --> 13:18.598
I JUST CAN'T PROMISE YOU THE
7 MILLION WITHOUT THE KITCHEN.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.817
- ADRIANNA'S APARTMENT HAS BEEN
ON THE MARKET FOR A WHILE NOW,

13:37.851 --> 13:39.552
AND I'VE GOTTEN
PLENTY OF FEEDBACK,

13:39.586 --> 13:41.821
AND EVERYONE AGREES THAT IT'S
JUST PRICED WAY TOO HIGH.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.089
- HEY, RYAN.
- HI.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.591
I WENT IN AGGRESSIVE,

13:44.624 --> 13:46.426
BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO MAKE
A DRASTIC CHANGE.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.460
SO...

13:47.494 --> 13:48.595
- YES.

13:48.628 --> 13:49.596
- YOU LOOK HOT, BY THE WAY.

13:49.629 --> 13:50.897
- HA, VERY FUNNY.

13:50.930 --> 13:55.235
- UM, SO WE HAVE HEAVY
INTEREST IN THE APARTMENT

13:55.268 --> 13:56.236
FROM THE FRENCHIES--
WALKED AROUND.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.637
- YES, YES.
- SO THEY LIKE IT.

13:57.671 --> 14:01.041
BUT IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO PULL AN OFFER OUT OF THEM

14:01.041 --> 14:05.311
WITH THE PRICE
BEING WHERE IT IS.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.380
LOOK, THE FEEDBACK THAT
I'M GETTING FOR THE APARTMENT

14:07.414 --> 14:08.882
IS THAT PEOPLE COME IN
AND THEY LOVE IT,

14:08.915 --> 14:10.583
BUT THEY ALL WANT
TO DO RENOVATIONS TO IT,

14:10.617 --> 14:12.152
BECAUSE IT'S VERY
PERSONALIZED.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.520
SO THE OFFERS
THAT I'M GONNA GET,

14:13.553 --> 14:16.322
THEY'RE GONNA FACTOR IN
THEIR FUTURE RENOVATION COSTS

14:16.356 --> 14:18.458
INTO THEIR PURCHASE PRICE.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.193
IT'S A TOUGH THING
FOR A SELLER TO HEAR

14:20.226 --> 14:22.162
THAT PEOPLE AREN'T
RESPONDING TO THEIR APARTMENT

14:22.195 --> 14:23.630
BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT LOOKS.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.332
THERE MAY BE SOMEONE WHO LOVES
THE WAY THE APARTMENT LOOKS,

14:26.366 --> 14:31.237
BUT TO FIND THAT PERSON,
IT COULD TAKE A LONG, LONG TIME.

14:31.271 --> 14:34.474
SO I THINK WE NEED
TO DROP THE PRICE.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.479
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

14:39.512 --> 14:43.683
- LIKE,
BY HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.920
- [sighs]

14:46.953 --> 14:48.588
YOU JUST WANT ME
TO MAKE YOUR JOB EASIER.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.657
IF I DROP THE PRICE,
IF IT'S EASIER FOR YOU TO SELL,

14:50.690 --> 14:52.125
YOU MAKE MONEY FASTER.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.527
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
WORK HARDER?

14:54.561 --> 14:56.262
- I AM WORKING
INCREDIBLY HARD.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.365
IF I KNOW THAT WE CAN DROP IT

14:58.398 --> 15:00.867
TO 3,895,000,

15:00.900 --> 15:03.136
THEN WE'RE GONNA GET THE BUYER
THAT WE NEED TO GET.

15:03.169 --> 15:04.671
I'M GONNA PULL IT OUT
OF THE FRENCHIES

15:04.704 --> 15:05.739
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

15:05.772 --> 15:09.142
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT I DO.

15:09.175 --> 15:10.343
- FINE. FINE.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.711
- ALL RIGHT. DEAL?

15:11.745 --> 15:13.880
- BUT BE QUICK.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.287
- TREVOR'S BUILDING'S ONE

15:21.321 --> 15:22.956
THAT I'VE BEEN WATCHING
REALLY CLOSELY.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.759
IT IS ON PARK AVENUE
ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.194
IT'S PROBABLY THE WEALTHIEST
PLACE TO LIVE IN THE WORLD.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.963
IT TAKES A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF SOPHISTICATION

15:30.063 --> 15:31.498
TO FIT IN
ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.267
TREVOR BUILT AN
ULTRA-MODERN GLASS STRUCTURE

15:34.300 --> 15:36.169
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF ALL THESE ORNATE,

15:36.202 --> 15:38.872
PRE-WAR LIMESTONE BUILDINGS.

15:38.905 --> 15:39.873
HELLO.

15:39.906 --> 15:40.874
- HI, MICHAEL.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.308
- HI, MIKE.
YOU MADE IT.

15:42.342 --> 15:46.413
- DINA IS THE ON-SITE AGENT
AT 1055 PARK AVENUE.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.414
HOW ARE YOU, TREVOR?

15:47.447 --> 15:48.882
- WELCOME TO 1055.

15:48.915 --> 15:50.984
- AND I'M CO-LISTING
ONE OF THE FIVE UNITS

15:51.084 --> 15:51.885
IN THE BUILDING WITH HER.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.486
SHOW ME AROUND, PLEASE.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.088
IT IS ALL GLASS.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.724
I MEAN, YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE ON PARK AVENUE.

15:57.757 --> 15:58.958
IT'S LIKE LIVING
IN A FISH BOWL.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.027
IT'S LIVING
IN A PIECE OF ART.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.800
THE STAGING IN THIS APARTMENT
IS AMAZING.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.202
I MEAN, IT WAS DONE BY ONE OF
THE TOP DESIGNERS IN MANHATTAN.

16:09.235 --> 16:11.671
IT'S SLEEK,
IT'S SEXY, IT'S MODERN.

16:11.705 --> 16:13.440
JUST LIKE THE BUILDING.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.375
ALL THE APARTMENTS
HAVE THESE GLASS STAIRCASES?

16:15.408 --> 16:16.643
- YES.
AREN'T THEY AMAZING?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.211
AND I'VE BEEN TOLD
BY THE DESIGNER

16:18.244 --> 16:20.113
THAT YOU CAN TAKE
A SLEDGEHAMMER TO THESE STAIRS

16:20.146 --> 16:22.682
AND THEY WILL NOT BREAK.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.154
IF THIS IS YOUR CHILD'S ROOM,

16:28.188 --> 16:30.290
THEN THEY HAVE, UH--

16:30.323 --> 16:33.059
LIFE IS ONLY
DOWNHILL FROM HERE.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.862
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN
MOVIE THEATER IN THEIR ROOM.

16:39.833 --> 16:40.967
- SO YOU HAD A GREAT TOUR?

16:41.067 --> 16:41.968
- WE HAD A GREAT TOUR.

16:42.068 --> 16:42.969
- THANKS VERY MUCH.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.604
- IT REALLY SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.140
IT'S NOT, UH, YOUR TYPICAL,
YOU KNOW--

16:47.173 --> 16:48.842
IT'S NOT
A PARK AVENUE BUILDING.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.443
I MEAN,
I COULD TELL YOU REALLY

16:50.477 --> 16:52.278
POURED YOUR HEART AND SOUL
INTO THIS BUILDING.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.480
IT'S AMAZING.

16:53.513 --> 16:57.217
- IT TOOK APPROXIMATELY
FOUR YEARS TO BUILD.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.351
IT SELLS ITSELF.

16:58.385 --> 16:59.886
- SHOULD I GO?

16:59.919 --> 17:02.288
I MEAN, YOU DON'T NEED ME HERE?
[laughter]

17:02.322 --> 17:04.657
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I'M GONNA HELP SELL IT.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.027
- THE IMPORTANT THING IS
TO GENERATE THE RIGHT TRAFFIC.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.428
- OKAY.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.929
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT FOR IT?

17:10.030 --> 17:14.134
- WE WERE, UH, EXPECTING

17:14.167 --> 17:18.505
APPROXIMATELY 6 1/2 MILLION.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.673
- HOW'D YOU GET
TO THAT NUMBER?

17:19.706 --> 17:22.108
JUST CURIOUS FOR MY OWN...
PROCESS HERE.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.309
- FROM THE COMPS.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.511
- I'VE LOOKED
AT THE COMPS TOO,

17:24.544 --> 17:26.513
AND NOW THAT
I'VE TOURED THE BUILDING,

17:26.546 --> 17:28.314
I JUST REALLY FEEL LIKE
WE'D GET MORE TRACTION

17:28.348 --> 17:30.250
IF WE CAN BRING THAT DOWN
TO 6 MILLION.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.851
- YOU THINK WE CAN MOVE IT
AT THAT?

17:31.885 --> 17:33.219
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.221
I MEAN, THERE'S SOME
OTHER STUFF RIGHT AROUND HERE

17:35.255 --> 17:37.691
IN THE LOW SIXES, BUT I LIKE
TO COME IN JUST UNDERNEATH THEM

17:37.724 --> 17:38.792
AND REALLY DRAW PEOPLE HERE.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.126
NOW ONCE
THEY'RE IN THE BUILDING,

17:40.160 --> 17:43.496
YOU KNOW,
IT'S AN EASY SELL.

17:43.530 --> 17:46.066
- IF YOU COULD DELIVER
6 MILLION,

17:46.066 --> 17:49.069
THAT'S SOMETHING
WE WOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.603
- THIS APARTMENT
AT $6 MILLION

17:50.637 --> 17:52.472
IS CLOSE TO $2,000 A FOOT.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.307
BUT, I MEAN,
THE PARK AVENUE ADDRESS ALONE

17:54.341 --> 17:56.076
REALLY JUSTIFIES THE PRICE.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.144
IF THIS APARTMENT WERE
A HUNDRED FEET TO THE RIGHT,

17:58.178 --> 18:00.380
YOU KNOW, FURTHER TOWARDS
LEXINGTON AVENUE,

18:00.413 --> 18:01.915
IT'D PROBABLY BE
A MILLION DOLLARS LESS.

18:02.015 --> 18:05.018
- OKAY.
LET'S GO WITH THE 6 MILLION.

18:05.018 --> 18:06.052
- LET'S GET THESE SOLD.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.420
- LET'S START.
- ABSOLUTELY.

18:07.454 --> 18:10.156
GETTING MY NAME ON A LISTING
IN TREVOR'S NEW BUILDING

18:10.190 --> 18:12.025
IS A MAJOR COUP FOR ME,

18:12.058 --> 18:15.028
BUT I REALLY WON'T PROVE MYSELF
UNTIL I SELL IT.

18:15.028 --> 18:16.129
- THANK YOU.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.897
- LOOK FORWARD
TO A SUCCESSFUL TRANSACTION.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.333
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.
- OKAY. THANKS, MIKE.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.109
- I'VE GOT ADRIANNA
TO LOWER THE PRICE,

18:29.142 --> 18:32.479
AND I'M GONNA GIVE
THE FRENCHY BROKERS A CALL.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.748
HEY, LOIC.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:37.650 --> 18:39.219
AND GIVE THEM THE IMPRESSION

18:39.252 --> 18:41.788
THAT I'M WORKING EXTRA HARD
FOR THEIR CLIENTS

18:41.821 --> 18:43.056
TO HELP GET THIS DEAL DONE.

18:43.056 --> 18:46.693
I'M GONNA DROP THE PRICE
TOMORROW MORNING...

18:46.726 --> 18:48.628
TO A LITTLE UNDER 4 MILLION.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.130
ALL RIGHT?

18:50.163 --> 18:55.602
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU GUYS--

18:55.635 --> 18:57.137
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.672
THERE'S TOO MUCH
INTO THIS APARTMENT.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.106
I'M DROPPING IT
TOMORROW MORNING.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.675
I'M GONNA GO LIVE WITH IT
UNDER 4 MILLION,

19:01.708 --> 19:04.277
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU HAVE
UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING

19:04.310 --> 19:06.179
TO BRING ME AN OFFER
FROM YOUR BUYERS,

19:06.212 --> 19:07.614
'CAUSE I'M--
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

19:07.647 --> 19:09.015
I'M TELLING
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.884
IF PEOPLE THINK THAT
THEY'RE GONNA LOSE A PROPERTY,

19:10.917 --> 19:13.286
THEN THEY'RE MORE APT
TO PULL THE TRIGGER.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.688
BECAUSE YOU WANT
WHAT YOU CAN'T HAVE.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.524
COME BACK TO ME
AND BRING ME AN OFFER.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.592
ALL RIGHT.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.394
TONIGHT I HAVE A DATE
WITH KELLY.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.063
UH, CASEY.

19:23.096 --> 19:25.832
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET THE BILL, HONEY.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.948
- I HAVE TWO GOALS
WITH THIS OPEN HOUSE.

19:42.048 --> 19:45.318
ONE OBVIOUS ONE IS TO GET OFFERS
AND INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.654
SO I WANT YOU TO TAKE--
WHEN PEOPLE COME IN,

19:47.687 --> 19:49.055
THE FIRST STATION IS HERE.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.423
- OKAY.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.425
- THE OTHER ONE IS TO HAVE
FEEDBACK BACK TO CLAUDIA

19:52.459 --> 19:53.460
ABOUT THE PRICE.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.928
OKAY, SO THESE
ARE THE SHOW SHEET.

19:54.961 --> 19:55.962
[bell rings]

19:56.062 --> 19:58.131
- WELCOME TO 84 MERCER.
- HI.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.265
- THANKS.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.367
- I'M ARIEL GRUBER.
- I'M ANYA.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.368
- LOOK AT ALL THOSE WINDOWS.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.469
- GOT A CLASSIC SOHO VIEW.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.571
- IT'S AMAZING.
- THIS IS THE KITCHEN.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.739
- YOU KNOW, I THINK--

20:05.772 --> 20:07.474
I THINK IT MIGHT NEED
JUST A BIT OF UPDATING.

20:07.507 --> 20:08.742
I MEAN, FOR A PLACE OF--

20:08.775 --> 20:10.543
YOU KNOW, THAT'S GOING
FOR THIS TYPE OF MONEY.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.911
- SHE HAS ACTUALLY,
THE SELLER,

20:11.945 --> 20:14.981
GONE TO ITALY THREE TIMES
AND PICKED OUT ONE KITCHEN.

20:15.015 --> 20:17.050
- SO SHE'S PLANNING
ON DOING THAT, UH,

20:17.083 --> 20:18.051
AS PART OF THE SALE?

20:18.084 --> 20:19.352
- YES.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.654
- BUT I THINK ANYBODY
SPENDING THIS KIND OF MONEY

20:21.688 --> 20:23.923
IS GOING TO WANT
TO PUT THEIR OWN STAMP ON IT.

20:23.957 --> 20:25.825
- WE'RE ASKING 7 MILLION.

20:25.859 --> 20:27.594
WHAT IS YOUR CLIENT
LOOKING FOR?

20:27.627 --> 20:29.662
- A LOT OF SPACE,
A LOT OF CHARACTER,

20:29.696 --> 20:31.364
AND REAL VALUE.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.933
I THINK WITH THIS ONE,
IF YOU LOWER THE PRICE,

20:33.967 --> 20:35.735
YOU CAN CALL ME.

20:35.769 --> 20:36.936
- YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
SEEN IT YET.

20:36.970 --> 20:40.407
- I GET AN IDEA OF IT.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.641
- I THINK EVERYONE'S
IN AGREEMENT.

20:41.675 --> 20:42.709
IT'S AN AMAZING SPACE.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.944
- IT, UH--I MEAN,
IT DOES SEEM HIGH.

20:44.978 --> 20:46.846
- BUT THE PRICE IS WRONG.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.416
- I WILL THINK
ABOUT THIS AND CALL YOU.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.785
- YOU HAVE FIVE,
SIX, SEVEN PEOPLE,

20:51.818 --> 20:53.286
THEY'RE ALL SAYING
THE SAME THING.

20:53.319 --> 20:54.454
THAT IS THE EVIDENCE.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.389
THE MARKET
HAS JUST PROVEN ITSELF

20:56.423 --> 20:58.725
THAT I WAS RIGHT.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.068
- THIS BROKER'S OPEN HOUSE
IS HUGE FOR ME.

21:08.068 --> 21:10.737
IT'S THE FIRST ONE
I'VE HOSTED ALL BY MYSELF.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.340
BASICALLY, I NEED
TO PROVE MY WORTH.

21:13.373 --> 21:16.943
TREVOR BROUGHT ME ON BECAUSE
PARK AVENUE IS MY TERRITORY.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.978
I HAVE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE
OF PARK AVENUE.

21:19.079 --> 21:21.181
I'VE LIVED AROUND THERE
MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE.

21:21.214 --> 21:23.183
I KNOW PARK AVENUE.

21:23.216 --> 21:24.284
UGH.

21:24.317 --> 21:25.385
MICHAEL.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.653
- ROBIN.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.888
MASSAGE THERAPIST
FROM EASTSIDE MASSAGE THERAPY.

21:28.922 --> 21:31.424
- I DO THINK THIS PROPERTY
HAS A ZEN-LIKE QUALITY,

21:31.458 --> 21:33.493
AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.695
BROKERS ARE ON THEIR WAY UP.
OPEN THE FLOOD GATES.

21:38.098 --> 21:39.766
- BEEN A WHILE.
- WELCOME TO 1055.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.334
HOW'S IT GOING?
- THANK YOU. GOOD, GOOD.

21:41.368 --> 21:42.969
- HI.
MICHAEL LORBER.

21:43.003 --> 21:45.105
DO YOU WANT A BACK MASSAGE
WHILE YOU'RE HERE?

21:45.138 --> 21:46.406
- BACK MASSAGE TOO?
WOW.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.540
- NICE.

21:47.574 --> 21:49.109
- DO YOU WANT TO SEE
THE APARTMENT FIRST?

21:49.109 --> 21:50.610
- YEAH, LET'S SEE
THE APARTMENT FIRST.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.512
- THE KITCHEN HAS
EVERYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.447
- OH, MY GOD.
- BEAUTIFUL.

21:54.481 --> 21:55.515
- I FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD BE

21:55.548 --> 21:57.217
WALKING DOWN THE AISLE
TO THIS MUSIC.

21:57.250 --> 21:58.551
[harp playing]
IT'S SO SOOTHING.

21:58.585 --> 21:59.586
EVERYONE LOVES IT.

21:59.619 --> 22:00.854
SO YOU HAVE THIS LANDING,

22:00.887 --> 22:02.722
WHICH THE DEVELOPER
PUT THIS GREAT BOOKCASE IN,

22:02.756 --> 22:04.190
SO THIS BECAME
A LITTLE STUDY AREA.

22:04.224 --> 22:05.191
- LOVE THAT.

22:05.225 --> 22:06.393
- IT'S A SPECTACULAR PROPERTY.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.627
- IT REALLY--
IT'S JUST UNIQUE.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.728
- SPECTACULAR.

22:08.762 --> 22:09.963
- HAPPY FEELING.
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.564
IT'S A VERY--
IT'S A TRANQUIL APARTMENT.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.066
IT'S JUST--IT'S CHEERY.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.601
I'M PLEASED.
THE TRAFFIC WAS DECENT.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.069
EVERYONE SEEMED
TO ENJOY THE SPACE.

22:16.069 --> 22:17.170
- AMAZING PROPERTY.

22:17.203 --> 22:18.505

IT'S ONE OF A KIND.

22:18.538 --> 22:19.806
- GREAT BROKER,
GREAT PROPERTY.

22:19.839 --> 22:20.907
- THANK YOU.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.076
I'M A NATURAL.
IT MUST BE GENETIC.

22:23.076 --> 22:25.078
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

22:25.078 --> 22:26.813
OKAY, LADIES, WE'RE DONE.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.248
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

22:28.281 --> 22:29.482
WE HAVE A FEW MINUTES.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.117
MAYBE I CAN GET A LITTLE
NECK MASSAGE?

22:31.151 --> 22:32.118
AH, RIGHT THERE.

22:32.152 --> 22:34.087
IS THERE, LIKE,
A KNOT OR SOMETHING?

22:40.193 --> 22:41.861
- HI.
HOW ARE YOU?

22:41.895 --> 22:43.096
ARIEL GRUBER.

22:43.096 --> 22:44.364
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

22:44.397 --> 22:46.166
- AS SOON AS THIS
POTENTIAL BUYER COMES IN,

22:46.199 --> 22:47.334
I SCAN HER.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.902
SHE IS DRESSED TO THE NINES,

22:48.935 --> 22:50.737
AND SHE'S DRIPPING IN MONEY.

22:50.770 --> 22:53.106
- THIS IS YOUR FIRST APARTMENT
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IN SOHO,

22:53.106 --> 22:54.908
OR HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN LOOKING
AROUND FOR A WHILE?

22:54.941 --> 22:56.476
- WE'VE LOOKED
IN SOHO, GRAMERCY.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.511
- HOW MANY BEDROOMS
DO YOU GUYS NEED?

22:58.545 --> 22:59.746
- AT LEAST THREE.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.114
- OKAY, GOOD.
- WOW.

23:01.147 --> 23:02.182
- THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.050
- THE LADDER'S INCLUDED?
[laughter]

23:04.050 --> 23:05.352
- TO GET TO THE EXTRA--

23:05.385 --> 23:06.920
- I'LL THROW IT IN FOR YOU.
HOW'S THAT?

23:06.953 --> 23:08.621
- WAIT, I DON'T THINK
I CAN GET UP THE LADDER

23:08.655 --> 23:10.590
IN MY DOLCE VITAS.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.492
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO THINK
OF SOMETHING ELSE THERE.

23:12.525 --> 23:13.560
- CAN GET AN ASSISTANT.

23:13.593 --> 23:14.928
- OKAY, LET ME
SHOW YOU THE KITCHEN.

23:14.961 --> 23:15.895
- I DON'T REALLY COOK.

23:15.929 --> 23:17.097
I HAVE PEOPLE COOK FOR ME,

23:17.130 --> 23:18.565
AND I DON'T EVEN DO
THE DISHES ANYMORE.

23:18.598 --> 23:19.933
I FOUND SOMEONE
TO DO THOSE TOO.

23:19.966 --> 23:21.167
- OH, WOW.
- OH, WOW.

23:21.201 --> 23:22.836
- I KNOW. I'VE REALLY
FIGURED IT OUT IN LIFE.

23:22.869 --> 23:25.772
- OKAY, THIRD BEDROOM.
- THANKS.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.207
THIS IS A DREAM ROOM FOR KIDS.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.608
- YES.
- WOW.

23:28.641 --> 23:30.510
BUT THE--AGAIN,
I LOVE THE ON-SUITE BATHROOMS.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.178
- BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS.

23:32.212 --> 23:33.546
- NO, HONEY.
MM-MM.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.215
- ARE YOU PLANNING
ON HAVING ANY?

23:35.248 --> 23:36.783
- LET'S NOT GO THERE.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.118
I HAVE A DOG,
AND THAT'S ENOUGH.

23:38.151 --> 23:40.186
- WHAT TYPE OF DOG?
- OH, SHE'S A DIVA.

23:40.220 --> 23:41.654
JAPANESE SPITZ.

23:41.688 --> 23:44.691
- A JAPANESE "SHPITZ"?

23:44.724 --> 23:47.827
BUT SHE LOOKS A LITTLE ANGRY.

23:47.861 --> 23:49.462
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT?

23:49.496 --> 23:50.930
- HONESTLY, NO, I HAVEN'T.

23:50.964 --> 23:52.198
IT'S AMAZING.

23:52.232 --> 23:53.566
- I MEAN,
I DON'T KNOW YOU YET,

23:53.600 --> 23:55.769
BUT YOU'RE SUPER BEAUTIFUL,
SO STYLISH.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.771
- VERY.

23:57.804 --> 23:59.172
- HE KNOWS--
HE KNOWS HOW TO SELL IT.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.607
- IF I WASN'T TAKEN,
I WOULD, LIKE,

24:00.640 --> 24:02.676
YOU KNOW, ASK YOU OUT.

24:02.709 --> 24:06.179
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU MIGHT
EVEN WANT TO CONSIDER AN OFFER?

24:06.212 --> 24:07.681
IT'S PRICED AT 7 MILLION.

24:07.714 --> 24:08.915
THAT'S THE ASKING PRICE.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.950
- I--HONESTLY,
I'D HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT,

24:11.051 --> 24:12.352
BECAUSE THERE ARE JUST
A FEW ISSUES

24:12.385 --> 24:13.353
THAT I WOULD WANT TO WEIGH

24:13.386 --> 24:15.121
AS FAR AS THE PRICE, AND...

24:15.155 --> 24:16.523
I JUST HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.857
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.459
- THANK YOU.
- IT WAS LOVELY MEETING YOU.

24:19.492 --> 24:20.927
- I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.462
- BYE.

24:29.703 --> 24:31.204
- HEY.
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

24:31.237 --> 24:32.772
- HOW ARE YOU?

24:32.806 --> 24:36.242
- I'M GOOD. I AM, LIKE,
AROUND THE CORNER, KIND OF.

24:36.276 --> 24:37.277
- OH, OKAY.

24:37.310 --> 24:38.445
- BUT TAKE YOUR TIME.

24:38.478 --> 24:39.612
I'M A NERVOUS GUY.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.081
I'M ALWAYS SCARED
TO ASK PEOPLE OUT.

24:41.081 --> 24:42.549
AND APRIL
WORKS FOR THE COMPANY,

24:42.582 --> 24:44.384
SO MY DAD
SET ME UP WITH HER.

24:44.417 --> 24:46.986
NO WORRIES.

24:47.087 --> 24:48.755
I'M FEELING A LITTLE PRESSURE
FROM MY FAMILY,

24:48.788 --> 24:51.291
BECAUSE MY BROTHER'S MARRIED,
HAS AN AMAZING FAMILY,

24:51.324 --> 24:53.460
GORGEOUS WIFE,
TWO AMAZING KIDS.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.862
THANKS.

25:03.203 --> 25:05.138
YOU KNOW, I'M ALWAYS
SO EARLY FOR EVERYTHING.

25:05.171 --> 25:06.306
IT'S JUST HOW I AM.

25:06.339 --> 25:07.707
IT'S ANXIETY.
IT'S JUST NEW YORK.

25:07.741 --> 25:09.576
I AM ALWAYS EARLY
FOR EVERYTHING.

25:09.609 --> 25:12.812
- HI.
- HEY. HOW ARE YOU?

25:12.846 --> 25:14.447
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

25:14.481 --> 25:15.815
- NICE TO SEE YOU.
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.

25:15.849 --> 25:16.850

25:20.920 --> 25:22.856
- HEELS.

25:26.192 --> 25:29.829
- NEW YORK CITY IS--
IS FULL OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN,

25:29.863 --> 25:35.335
AND IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO ME

25:35.368 --> 25:37.671
NOT TO DATE
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.673
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU, BUDDY?

25:39.706 --> 25:41.408
- I'M SORRY.

25:41.441 --> 25:43.977
- YEAH, THANKS.
- OH, MAN.

25:44.077 --> 25:45.145
ALMOST. ALMOST.

25:45.178 --> 25:47.814
TONIGHT I HAVE A DATE

25:56.790 --> 25:57.791
- WANT TO DO A TEQUILA SHOT?

25:57.824 --> 25:58.792
- BODY SHOTS?
JUST KIDDING.

25:58.825 --> 25:59.793
- DO YOU WANT TO DO
BODY SHOTS?

25:59.826 --> 26:01.027
DO YOU HAVE A BODY
FOR BODY SHOTS?

26:01.061 --> 26:02.328
I THINK YOU DO.
- OH, YEAH?

26:02.362 --> 26:04.030
- ISN'T THAT HOW I MET YOU,
DOING BODY SHOTS?

26:04.030 --> 26:05.031
- OH, YEAH.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.299
- SO YOU'RE A TRAINER?

26:06.332 --> 26:07.901
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO START
WITH A DRINK?

26:07.934 --> 26:11.671
OUR SPECIAL BELLINI
OR A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE?

26:11.705 --> 26:12.772
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

26:12.806 --> 26:14.941
- UH,
LET HER SEE THE WINE LIST.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.676
OR RED? WHITE?

26:16.710 --> 26:19.212
- WHATEVER YOU'D LIKE.
I'M NOT PICKY.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.947
- MAYBE A COCKTAIL?
YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU FEEL LIKE?

26:21.047 --> 26:23.183
WINE OR A COCKTAIL.
- YOU DECIDE.

26:23.216 --> 26:24.818
- I DON'T DO EITHER,
BUT I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU DO.

26:24.851 --> 26:26.386
SO IT'S OKAY.

26:26.419 --> 26:29.556
UH...COULD WE GET
SOME WATER PLEASE?

26:29.589 --> 26:30.957
- THIS TASTES LIKE CANDY.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.225
- CANDY?
- YEAH.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.226
- I TASTE LIKE CANDY.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.527
[laughter]

26:34.561 --> 26:36.062
- CASEY'S THE KIND OF GIRL

26:36.062 --> 26:38.698
THAT YOU GO OUT WITH
FOR A NIGHT TO--

26:38.732 --> 26:40.166
TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN WITH.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.401
AM I GONNA
FALL IN LOVE WITH HER?

26:41.434 --> 26:42.402
AM I GONNA MARRY HER?

26:42.435 --> 26:44.971
I DON'T THINK SO.

26:45.071 --> 26:46.439
CAREFUL.
- I KNOW.

26:46.473 --> 26:47.607
- CAREFUL.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.142
- THESE THINGS JUST
POP OUT AT ANY TIME.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.744
- YEAH.

26:50.777 --> 26:52.879
- MM.

26:55.482 --> 26:57.584
- I COME OFF REALLY SHY,

26:57.617 --> 27:02.322
BUT THAT'S JUST INSECURITY.

27:02.355 --> 27:03.790
YOU KNOW,
I STILL SEE MYSELF AS, LIKE,

27:03.823 --> 27:04.924
A SHORT, LITTLE FAT KID

27:05.025 --> 27:06.926
WITH GLASSES AND BAD TEETH
TYPE OF THING.

27:07.027 --> 27:08.228
YOU KNOW,
WHICH MAYBE I STILL AM.

27:08.261 --> 27:09.229
I DON'T KNOW.

27:09.262 --> 27:10.397
SINCE I GOT THESE VENEERS,

27:10.430 --> 27:12.599
LIKE, EIGHT YEARS AGO,
I ALWAYS GET FOOD--

27:12.632 --> 27:14.134
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

27:14.167 --> 27:16.169
- YEAH. WHY?
YOU THOUGHT MY TEETH WERE REAL?

27:16.202 --> 27:17.470
- THEY AREN'T?

27:17.504 --> 27:18.938
- OH, I HAD HORRIBLE TEETH
AS A KID.

27:19.039 --> 27:21.107
I DON'T THINK I SMILED TILL
I WAS, LIKE, OUT OF COLLEGE.

27:21.141 --> 27:22.676
OH, THANK YOU.

27:22.709 --> 27:23.843
OH, I'M SORRY.

27:23.877 --> 27:26.046
I DIDN'T NOTICE
YOUR GLASS WAS EMPTY.

27:26.046 --> 27:29.115
EMBARRASSING.

27:29.149 --> 27:32.218
- DO YOU WANT TO COME HOME
AND SEE MY--MY SNAKE?

27:32.252 --> 27:33.219
- I LOVE SNAKE.

27:33.253 --> 27:36.089
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YES.

27:36.122 --> 27:39.059
- WE SHOULD LEAVE
IMMEDIATELY.

27:42.062 --> 27:43.363
- [laughs]

27:43.396 --> 27:44.597
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:44.631 --> 27:46.166
- I GUESS I'M GETTING
MY CREDIT CARD OUT.

27:46.199 --> 27:50.704
- OH...

27:50.737 --> 27:52.906
- I DON'T KNOW.

28:00.680 --> 28:05.318
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET THE BILL, HONEY.

28:05.352 --> 28:06.720
[laughs]

28:06.753 --> 28:08.355
- THANK YOU FOR DINNER.

28:08.388 --> 28:09.756
IT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU.

28:09.789 --> 28:11.324
- ANY TIME.
- SO NICE TO CATCH UP.

28:11.358 --> 28:13.093
- I'M ALWAYS DOWN FOR
EXPERIENCING SOMETHING NEW.

28:13.126 --> 28:14.227
- YEAH.

28:14.260 --> 28:15.695
- AS LONG AS I'M IN BED
BY, LIKE, 10:00.

28:15.729 --> 28:16.896
I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

28:16.930 --> 28:18.932
YOU KNOW,
LOVE'S JUST ONE OF THOSE...

28:19.032 --> 28:22.068
TRICKY, LITTLE THINGS.

28:22.102 --> 28:24.270
- COME HERE, SEXY.

28:24.304 --> 28:27.040
THE SEXIEST BROKER
IN NEW YORK.

28:27.073 --> 28:29.809
- UGH. ALL RIGHT.

28:31.044 --> 28:32.445
EXCUSE MY FRENCH,

28:32.479 --> 28:34.214
BUT I DON'T GIVE A FLYING
[bleep] ABOUT YOUR RENOVATION.

28:34.247 --> 28:35.715
- YOU DON'T WANT
TO MAKE A DEAL THEN.

28:35.749 --> 28:45.191
YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE A DEAL,
WE JUST LEAVE. THAT'S IT.

28:45.225 --> 28:46.693
- DID YOU GET
WHAT I ASKED YOU FOR?

28:46.726 --> 28:48.328
- YEP.
FRENCH FOR DUMMIES.

28:48.361 --> 28:49.662
- [mocking laugh]

28:49.696 --> 28:51.331
THESE GUYS ARE GONNA HIT ME
WITH A LOW OFFER.

28:51.364 --> 28:52.599
I KNOW IT.
I KNOW IT.

28:52.632 --> 28:54.300
SO I NEED TO SAY,
"YOUR OFFER IS TOO LOW."

28:54.334 --> 28:56.302
THE FRENCH BROKERS
HAVE ASKED TO MEET ME,

28:56.336 --> 28:58.238
AND HOPEFULLY
IT'S TO MAKE AN OFFER.

28:58.271 --> 29:01.341
SO I'M BRINGING DINA
TO DO A LITTLE PREPARATION

29:01.374 --> 29:02.475
BEFORE THE MEETING.

29:02.509 --> 29:05.045
- TO MAKE AN OFFER...
[speaks French]

29:05.078 --> 29:06.279
- [repeats French]

29:06.312 --> 29:07.647
- "YOU" IS...
[speaks French]

29:07.681 --> 29:08.648
- [repeats French]

29:08.682 --> 29:09.783
- SO...
[speaks French]

29:09.816 --> 29:10.884
- AND THEN
HOW DO YOU SAY "LOW"?

29:10.917 --> 29:11.885
- [says word in French]

29:11.918 --> 29:14.020
- [says phrase in French]

29:14.020 --> 29:15.088
THAT SOUNDS SO FRENCH!

29:15.121 --> 29:17.157
[repeats phrase]

29:17.190 --> 29:18.892
I WANT TO GO IN THERE
AND KNOW A LITTLE FRENCH

29:18.925 --> 29:20.627
AND SAY,
"WHAT'S UP NOW?

29:20.660 --> 29:22.762
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
BILINGUAL ONES IN THE ROOM."

29:22.796 --> 29:24.898
[speaks French]

29:24.931 --> 29:26.366
SO WATCH OUT, FRENCHIES.

29:26.399 --> 29:28.034
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR.

29:28.034 --> 29:30.670
I JUST SPIT EVERYWHERE.
I'M CLEARLY FRENCH NOW.

29:30.704 --> 29:31.705
- THAT'S WHAT THAT IS?

29:31.738 --> 29:33.306
I THOUGHT THE WINDOW
WAS OPEN ON TOP.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.120
- I'M FEELING
SOME PRESSURE FROM TREVOR,

29:47.153 --> 29:48.555
'CAUSE SINCE
THE BROKER'S OPEN HOUSE

29:48.588 --> 29:49.656
FOR THE PARK AVENUE LISTING,

29:49.689 --> 29:51.057
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE QUIET.

29:51.057 --> 29:53.193
SO I REACHED OUT TO A LOT
OF THE BROKERAGE COMMUNITY,

29:53.226 --> 29:55.061
AND MY FRIEND ALEXA
THOUGHT SHE HAD A CLIENT

29:55.061 --> 29:58.198
THAT THIS UNIT
WOULD BE PERFECT FOR.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.232
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

29:59.265 --> 30:00.200
- THANK YOU.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.435
- HI.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

30:02.469 --> 30:04.437
- GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.
THIS IS CY.

30:04.471 --> 30:06.072
- HOW ARE YOU?
NICE TO MEET YOU.

30:06.106 --> 30:07.307
- AND THIS IS HIS NEPHEW,
DAVID.

30:07.340 --> 30:08.508
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- HI.

30:08.541 --> 30:10.410
- ALEXA'S KIND OF NEW
TO BEING A BROKER.

30:10.443 --> 30:12.312
I MAY NOT HAVE
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE,

30:12.345 --> 30:16.616
BUT I GOT
A LOT MORE THAN ALEXA.

30:16.649 --> 30:18.151
SO YOU HAVE YOUR
FORMAL DINING ROOM HERE

30:18.184 --> 30:19.352
OFF THE KITCHEN.

30:19.386 --> 30:21.755
- WHAT I REALLY
LIKE ABOUT IT IS, UH--

30:21.788 --> 30:22.756
IS THE LIGHT.

30:22.789 --> 30:23.923
- NOW, DOES IT BOTHER YOU GUYS

30:23.957 --> 30:28.561
THAT YOU CAN SEE OUTSIDE
AND THEY CAN SEE YOU?

30:28.595 --> 30:30.096
DOES THAT BOTHER YOU AT ALL?

30:30.130 --> 30:31.431
- UH, NOT AT ALL.

30:31.464 --> 30:33.500
I THINK, UH, I THINK
IT'S GREAT FOR MY PURPOSES.

30:33.533 --> 30:36.369
I PREFER THE--I PREFER
THE AMBIANCE AND THE LIGHT.

30:36.403 --> 30:37.971
- WAY TO GO, ALEXA.

30:38.004 --> 30:40.540
GOOD JOB TURNING ONE OF THE BEST
FEATURES OF THIS APARTMENT

30:40.573 --> 30:41.508
INTO A NEGATIVE.

30:41.541 --> 30:43.443
- OH, WOW.

30:43.476 --> 30:45.111
YOU KNOW,
THE ONE THING THAT BOTHERS ME

30:45.145 --> 30:48.014
IS JUST THE FACT
THAT THE WINDOWS DON'T OPEN.

30:48.048 --> 30:49.983
I FEEL, LIKE,
CLAUSTROPHOBIC,

30:50.016 --> 30:51.551
AND THAT THERE'S NO AIR.

30:51.584 --> 30:52.852
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

30:52.886 --> 30:54.087
- YOU GOT CENTRAL AIR.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.422
YOU DON'T NEED
TO OPEN THE WINDOWS.

30:55.455 --> 30:56.623
- I DON'T FIND IT--
ACTUALLY, I DON'T FIND IT

30:56.656 --> 30:57.891
TO BE AN ISSUE,
BECAUSE I THINK YOU DON'T

30:57.924 --> 31:00.527
REALLY WANT TO OPEN
THE WINDOWS.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.562
- IN TERMS OF THE BEDROOMS,

31:02.595 --> 31:04.397
I FIND THEM TO BE
A LITTLE BIT SMALLER.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.568
- I THINK--
I THINK THE BEDROOMS

31:08.601 --> 31:10.370
ARE DEFINITELY
A LITTLE BIT SMALLER.

31:10.403 --> 31:11.504
- I MEAN, THIS BEDROOM IS--

31:11.538 --> 31:13.106
TAKES UP THE WHOLE
WIDTH OF THE BUILDING,

31:13.139 --> 31:15.675
SO IT'S A 16 1/2-FOOT BEDROOM.

31:15.709 --> 31:17.077
IF YOU'RE GONNA
START DISCUSSING

31:17.077 --> 31:18.945
POSSIBLE NEGATIVES
TO A BUILDING,

31:18.978 --> 31:20.547
I'D WAIT TILL YOU'RE
OUT OF THE BUILDING.

31:20.580 --> 31:23.216
- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?
ARE YOU GOOD?

31:23.249 --> 31:25.785
- UH, REALLY IT'S GONNA
BE A PRICE ISSUE,

31:25.819 --> 31:28.355
BUT WE CAN TALK
ABOUT THAT SEPARATELY.

31:28.388 --> 31:30.623
- WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA HAVE
TO NEGOTIATE A LITTLE BIT.

31:30.657 --> 31:32.525
- YEAH, YOU JUST
GOT TO MAKE AN OFFER.

31:39.466 --> 31:41.201
[cell phone rings]

31:41.234 --> 31:42.469

31:54.247 --> 31:56.683
WHAT'S THE OFFER?

31:56.716 --> 31:59.252
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD OFFER.

31:59.285 --> 32:00.854
I THINK
IT'S AN AMAZING NUMBER.

32:00.887 --> 32:04.891
I MEAN, CLAUDIA SHOULD TAKE IT.
SHE REALLY SHOULD.

32:04.924 --> 32:06.493
YOU KNOW, I CAN DO IT.
I HOPE.

32:06.526 --> 32:08.061
SHE'S A TOUGH ONE.

32:08.061 --> 32:10.764
I'M GONNA CALL HER NOW, AND
I'M GONNA GIVE HER THE OFFER.

32:10.797 --> 32:12.265
THANK YOU.

32:12.298 --> 32:17.370
[phone trilling]

32:17.404 --> 32:22.275
CLAUDIA, FREDRIK HERE,
YOUR FAVORITE BROKER.

32:22.308 --> 32:23.743
WELL, I HAVE
REALLY GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

32:23.777 --> 32:26.680
ARE YOU SITTING DOWN?

32:26.713 --> 32:27.681
I GOT AN OFFER FOR YOU,

32:27.714 --> 32:29.349
AND THIS IS A VERY GOOD ONE.

32:29.382 --> 32:32.118

32:44.364 --> 32:45.899
IT'S A GOOD OFFER.
IT'S A GOOD NUMBER.

32:45.932 --> 32:47.400
IT'S A HUGE NUMBER.
6.2.

32:47.434 --> 32:49.369
AND THEN IT'S JUST LIKE--
WOMP.

32:49.402 --> 32:50.537
DO YOU WANT TO COUNTER?

32:50.570 --> 32:52.105
MAYBE, LIKE,
TRY TO MEET IN THE MIDDLE?

32:52.105 --> 32:56.142
YOU KNOW?

32:56.176 --> 32:57.677
EVERYBODY COUNTERS.

32:57.711 --> 33:00.647
$5. $100.
YOU GOT TO COUNTER.

33:00.680 --> 33:02.215
LET'S COUNTER, CLAUDIA.

33:02.248 --> 33:06.052
WE CAN'T JUST THROW
A $6.2 MILLION OFFER AWAY.

33:12.092 --> 33:13.727
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.062
WE HAVE WORKED ON IT.
WE WORKED ON IT FOR A LONG TIME.

33:20.567 --> 33:22.569
OKAY, LOVE.
I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR.

33:22.602 --> 33:25.171
MEETING IN PERSON
IS ALWAYS BETTER--ON THE PHONE,

33:25.205 --> 33:28.174
SO IF I SIT IN FRONT OF HER,
LOOK HER IN THE EYES,

33:28.208 --> 33:30.877
AND TELL HER,
"NOW LET'S LOWER THE PRICE--"

33:30.910 --> 33:32.245
I WON'T GIVE UP
UNTIL IT'S DONE.

33:32.278 --> 33:34.314
I WON'T--I WON'T.

33:34.347 --> 33:37.117
AYE-YI-YI.

33:53.133 --> 33:54.467
THEY'RE GONNA TAG-TEAM ME,

33:54.501 --> 33:56.236
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
THESE KIND OF BROKERS DO.

33:56.269 --> 33:57.470

- MAYBE THEN
THEY SHOULD PAY FOR IT.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.089
- YOU KNOW,
THE KITCHEN, YOU KNOW...

34:52.192 --> 34:54.194
- RIGHT, BUT I DON'T REALLY CARE
ABOUT THE RENOVATION

34:54.227 --> 34:55.428
YOU GUYS WANT TO DO.

34:55.462 --> 34:58.598
I CARE ABOUT THE RENOVATIONS
THAT MY GUYS DID.

34:58.631 --> 35:00.800
THE OFFER'S TOO LOW.
THE OFFER'S TOO LOW.

35:00.834 --> 35:02.902
I'M NOT GONNA CALL THEM
UNLESS YOU COME UP.

35:02.936 --> 35:06.339
- [speaks French]

35:06.373 --> 35:07.540
- TRY TO CALL.
WE'LL TRY TO CALL.

35:07.574 --> 35:12.212
- LET ME--
LET ME GIVE A CALL.

35:12.245 --> 35:13.213
- YOU'RE A NICE GUY.

35:13.246 --> 35:14.414
BETWEEN YOU AND ME...

35:14.447 --> 35:15.949
THERE'S NO WAY
WE CAN GET THIS DEAL DONE

35:16.049 --> 35:17.050
FOR ANYWHERE CLOSE TO 3.6.

35:17.083 --> 35:18.451
YOU GOT TO COME--
YOU GOT TO COME UP.

35:18.485 --> 35:20.754
[phone ringing]

35:25.058 --> 35:27.360
- [speaking French]

35:32.499 --> 35:35.535
<i>MERCI.</i>BYE.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.704
OKAY.
PARDON.

35:37.737 --> 35:41.374
UH...

35:45.078 --> 35:46.646
- GUYS, YOU ARE KILLING ME.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.415
YOU ARE LI--
YOU ARE LITERALLY KILLING ME.

35:48.448 --> 35:49.949
- 3.7.

35:49.983 --> 35:53.853
- IT IS THE ONLY DUPLEX...
ON THE BOULEVARD--

35:53.887 --> 35:55.822
- WITH RENOVATIONS.

35:55.855 --> 35:56.990
- THE RENOVATIONS
ARE METICULOUS.

35:57.090 --> 35:58.458
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR RENOVATIONS.

35:58.491 --> 36:00.326
I--REALLY, HONESTLY,
EXCUSE MY FRENCH,

36:00.360 --> 36:01.661
BUT I DON'T GIVE
A FLYING [bleep]

36:01.695 --> 36:03.663
ABOUT YOUR RENOVATION,
OKAY?

36:03.697 --> 36:05.632
HONESTLY, IT DOESN'T MAKE
A DIFFERENCE TO MY SELLER.

36:05.665 --> 36:06.666
- WAIT.

36:09.836 --> 36:12.238
- THIS NOW IS A BATTLE
BETWEEN BROKERS.

36:20.080 --> 36:22.048
- CLAUDIA?
- YES.

36:22.082 --> 36:23.183
- HI, LOVE.
- HI.

36:23.216 --> 36:24.918
- I FEEL LIKE I LIVE HERE NOW.

36:24.951 --> 36:26.619
- WHY?
YOU'VE SHOWN IT THAT MUCH?

36:26.653 --> 36:28.221
- MWAH. MWAH.
- I LOVE IT.

36:28.254 --> 36:29.956
- I'VE BEEN DOING REAL ESTATE
FOR A LONG TIME,

36:30.056 --> 36:32.625
AND I KNOW WHEN A SELLER
HAS OUT-PRICED HER HOME.

36:32.659 --> 36:35.595
IF CLAUDIA DOESN'T COME DOWN
FROM HER $7 MILLION,

36:35.628 --> 36:37.163
WE'RE NEVER
GONNA SELL THIS PLACE.

36:37.197 --> 36:39.065
EVER.

36:39.065 --> 36:42.068
UM...

36:42.102 --> 36:46.139
SO I'VE COME TO YOU
TO BEG YOU

36:46.172 --> 36:47.774
TO COME DOWN IN PRICE.

36:47.807 --> 36:50.176
7 MILLION IS TOO HIGH,
CLAUDIA.

36:50.210 --> 36:52.345
- I PERSONALLY THINK
THAT IT'S WORTH THAT

36:52.379 --> 36:53.713
AND EVERY PENNY MORE,

36:53.747 --> 36:58.618
BECAUSE OF THE DETAIL
THAT WE'VE PUT INTO THIS.

36:58.651 --> 37:03.790
I'M NOT BEING...
THICK-HEADED.

37:03.823 --> 37:05.258
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,

37:05.291 --> 37:09.295
THE THINGS THAT I'M SEEING
FOR $6 MILLION DO NOT COMPARE.

37:09.329 --> 37:11.464
I'VE BEEN LOOKING.
I'VE BEEN SEEING.

37:11.498 --> 37:14.734
I--I GET A SENSE FOR--
FOR THE MARKET,

37:14.768 --> 37:16.670
AND I DON'T THINK
IT'S WORTH A PENNY LESS.

37:16.703 --> 37:19.039
- THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE
ARGUMENT FROM ALL SELLERS.

37:19.039 --> 37:20.440
THEY'RE ONLINE AT NIGHT.

37:20.473 --> 37:22.876
THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING
LIKE THEIR OWN APARTMENT.

37:22.909 --> 37:24.310
I HEAR IT EVERY DAY.

37:24.344 --> 37:25.311
EMAIL THEM TO ME.

37:25.345 --> 37:28.314
WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

37:28.348 --> 37:31.051
IT'S BEEN ON THE MARKET.

37:31.051 --> 37:32.786
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T
FOOL THE MARKET.

37:32.819 --> 37:33.953
NO ONE CAN.

37:34.054 --> 37:35.288
IT'S BEEN IN
EVERY LISTING SYSTEM.

37:35.321 --> 37:36.656
WE'VE HAD AN OPEN HOUSE

37:36.690 --> 37:38.591
WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE
CALLING ON IT, AND IT'S LIKE--

37:38.625 --> 37:41.594
- SO WHAT--WHAT'S
THE BOTTOM LINE ON THIS THEN?

37:41.628 --> 37:44.264
- I GUESS IT'S AN ULTIMATUM.

37:44.297 --> 37:47.901
YOU NEED TO
COME DOWN IN PRICE.

37:47.934 --> 37:49.869
- OR YOU'RE LEAVING ME?

37:49.903 --> 37:52.405
- I CAN'T WITH
THE RIGHT CONSCIENCE

37:52.439 --> 37:55.542
KEEP ON REPRESENTING YOU,
THIS PROPERTY,

37:55.575 --> 37:56.509
FOR 7 MILLION.

37:56.543 --> 37:57.610
I'M DOING YOU A DISSERVICE.

37:57.644 --> 37:58.945
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE
A LOT OF TIME.

37:58.978 --> 38:00.714
I'VE KICKED THE FAMILY
OUT WHEN I'M SHOWING.

38:00.747 --> 38:01.915
I'M GONNA DO MORE OPEN HOUSES.

38:02.015 --> 38:04.084
I'M GONNA PUT MORE MONEY
OF MY OWN AND ENERGY,

38:04.117 --> 38:05.251
WHICH I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO,

38:05.285 --> 38:08.722
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA LEAD
TO THE 7 MILLION.

38:11.224 --> 38:13.126
- ALL RIGHT,
I DON'T THINK IT'S--

38:13.159 --> 38:14.761
I DON'T THINK IT'S HAPPENING.

38:14.794 --> 38:15.895
- IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

38:15.929 --> 38:18.598
LAST THING I WANT TO DO
IS LOSE THE LISTING,

38:18.631 --> 38:20.100
BUT I CANNOT CONTINUE.

38:20.133 --> 38:23.336
SHE'S DISCONNECTED
FROM REALITY AND THE MARKET.

38:23.370 --> 38:25.538
THERE'S NOTHING MORE I CAN DO.

38:25.572 --> 38:26.573
OKAY, GIVE ME A HUG.

38:26.606 --> 38:29.676
- ALL RIGHT, LOVE.

38:29.709 --> 38:31.044
- SAY HI TO THE GIRLS.

38:31.044 --> 38:32.045
- I WILL.

38:32.045 --> 38:33.913
- BYE, MERCER LOFT.

38:43.623 --> 38:45.058
- HEY, STRANGER.

38:45.058 --> 38:46.393
- HEY, ALEXA.

38:46.426 --> 38:47.727
- THANK YOU FOR MEETING ME.

38:47.761 --> 38:49.295
- MWAH. I'M JUST EXCITED
THAT YOU CALLED.

38:49.329 --> 38:50.430
OH, YOU GET TWO KISSES.

38:50.463 --> 38:52.132
HOW'S IT GOING?
HAVE A SEAT.

38:52.165 --> 38:53.600
- EVERYTHING IS GREAT.

38:53.633 --> 38:55.101
- YEAH?

38:55.135 --> 38:57.303
- SO--
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:57.337 --> 39:00.073
- SO YOU KNOW HOW MY BUYER
LOVED 1055 PARK?

39:00.106 --> 39:01.207
- YEAH.

39:01.241 --> 39:02.909
- HE THINKS
IT'S SO SEXY, SO COOL.

39:03.009 --> 39:04.210
- IT IS.
I'M GLAD HE LIKED IT.

39:04.244 --> 39:05.578
- YEAH.

39:05.612 --> 39:09.115
- THE QUESTION IS,
HOW MUCH DID HE LIKE IT?

39:09.149 --> 39:11.017
- I MEAN, HE LOVED IT.

39:11.051 --> 39:14.154
HE REALLY--
HE REALLY DID LIKE IT A LOT.

39:14.187 --> 39:15.889
- WELL, HOW MUCH?

39:15.922 --> 39:17.757
- HE ACTUALLY WANTS
TO PUT AN OFFER IN

39:17.791 --> 39:20.593
ON THE ENTIRE BUILDING.

39:20.627 --> 39:23.396
- SO THE WHOLE BUILDING.
WOW. OKAY.

39:23.430 --> 39:25.799
WOW.
HE REALLY LIKED IT.

39:25.832 --> 39:28.134
- HE SEES IT AS SUCH
A GOOD INVESTMENT,

39:28.168 --> 39:29.903
AND HE WANTS THE WHOLE THING.

39:29.936 --> 39:31.271
- OKAY.

39:31.304 --> 39:33.073
YEAH, I JUST...
THAT'S AWESOME.

39:33.106 --> 39:34.207
- I KNOW.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.809
- NO, I CAN'T WAIT
TO CALL MY CLIENT.

39:35.842 --> 39:37.444
THIS IS NUTS.
I MEAN, ARE YOU TELLING ME

39:37.477 --> 39:41.081
I CAN SELL FIVE UNITS
AT ONCE TO ONE CLIENT?

39:41.114 --> 39:43.850
I MEAN, THIS WOULD BE
AN AMAZING DEAL.

39:43.883 --> 39:45.685
OKAY,
I JUST HAVE TO FIND OUT--

39:45.719 --> 39:47.387
'CAUSE THERE ARE
FOUR OTHER APARTMENTS.

39:47.420 --> 39:48.455
I DON'T WORK ON ALL OF THOSE.

39:48.488 --> 39:49.456
- COMPLETELY.
I UNDERSTAND.

39:49.489 --> 39:50.457
- THEY COULD BE SOLD,

39:50.490 --> 39:52.158
OR UNDER CONTRACT AT LEAST.

39:52.192 --> 39:53.827
- RIGHT, WELL,
HERE'S THE THING.

39:53.860 --> 39:55.929
IF HE CAN'T HAVE
THE WHOLE DEAL,

39:55.962 --> 39:57.630
HE'S NOT IN IT.

39:57.664 --> 39:58.898
IT'S ALL OR NOTHING.

39:58.932 --> 40:00.133
- OKAY.

40:00.166 --> 40:02.435
THIS WOULD BE
A $30-MILLION-PLUS DEAL.

40:02.469 --> 40:04.137
PROBABLY MY BIGGEST EVER.

40:04.170 --> 40:06.072
THE COMMISSION
WOULD BE STRATOSPHERIC.

40:06.106 --> 40:07.674
IF I CAN PULL THIS DEAL OFF,

40:07.707 --> 40:10.677
IT'LL SOLIDIFY ME AS A TOP
UPPER EAST SIDE BROKER.
