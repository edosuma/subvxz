from where I had you staying.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.512
It's not like I said
stuff to him or nothing.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.680
- But he didn't come from nowhere.
- Okay,

19:09.682 --> 19:12.216
so I screamed a little
when carsen pulled my hair.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.485
This soldier boy and you
got something going?

19:14.487 --> 19:17.188
- <i>No.</i>
<i>- Tanya, don't fuck with me.</i>

19:17.190 --> 19:19.657
Okay, you know what? I did not
ask for any of this shit.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.827
I... carsen...
He got too rough with me.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.762
He got mean. He said
these two tweakers,

19:24.764 --> 19:27.532
that they could tag-team me
and share me or some shit

19:27.534 --> 19:30.368
- and teach me a lesson.
- All right, quiet down.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.374
I just...

19:36.376 --> 19:38.843
Wanna go back to, like, the
way it used to be, you know?

19:38.845 --> 19:41.379
Like, you used to...
Used to take me places,

19:41.381 --> 19:44.282
really nice... really nice places.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.686
We used to... we used to
sleep in your bed together.

19:51.557 --> 19:53.691
(Sniffles) You know? Remember?

19:55.928 --> 19:58.296
I don't like it like this.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.200
Of course you don't.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.902
Huh. Wanna come home with me?

20:04.904 --> 20:07.471

20:07.473 --> 20:09.640

20:40.940 --> 20:42.740
Who is she?

20:43.675 --> 20:45.543
Just a loose end.

20:46.511 --> 20:48.346
Clean this shit up.
Get the twats sold.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.714
We got work to do.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.749
Can we let this
little bitch come first?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.985
- What'd you say?
- <i>(Moaning continues)</i>

20:53.987 --> 20:56.254
Can we let this

20:56.256 --> 20:58.489
Carsen and Mikey
got killed last night.

21:00.859 --> 21:03.027
You fuckin' heard him. Get out!

21:03.029 --> 21:05.401
Man: Get the fuck out of here.
Let's go, move it.

You'll get off.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.926
Not what I did.

John, I'm telling you

- You're a fucking war hero.
- War hero?

22:20.573 --> 22:22.573
No one gives a shit about us.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.342
Don't be stupid, John.

- Hey, Hollis.

Been something of a ruckus,

I don't give a shit
how you keep yourself.

- Is he the quiet chink?
- <i>Uh... oh,</i>

- I guess so.
- (Sighs)

23:59.472 --> 24:02.773

I mean fucking John.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.608
Okay, uh, what about him?

24:04.610 --> 24:07.178
- Everything.
- All right, listen.

Mr. Hollis, I'm confused.

24:09.449 --> 24:13.050
No, you're stupid,
so I'll lay it out for you.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.186
I wanna know everything
about him that you do.

24:15.188 --> 24:18.522
So you'll have a copy
of his driver's license.

24:18.524 --> 24:20.624
I'll start with that.
Then I'll have his keys

we're at a dead end.

33:21.066 --> 33:23.734
That's why it's called
an investigation.

33:23.736 --> 33:25.736

Work the facts.

I've been on the phone

59:26.297 --> 59:28.764
- Why D.C.?
- John nguyen.

59:28.766 --> 59:30.966
It turns out he was a green beret.

59:30.968 --> 59:33.735
He's got a list of medals
half a page long.

59:33.737 --> 59:36.672
And check this out.

59:36.674 --> 59:38.707
He's famous.

- What am I watching?
- Just wait for it.

59:45.615 --> 59:48.750

Apparently being a guest
of the Taliban for a few weeks

01:00:15.879 --> 01:00:17.846

He's a decorated veteran.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.754

make him innocent.

What's the connection between them

01:00:39.036 --> 01:00:41.670
I don't know. Maybe this is the
tip of the shitberg or something.

01:00:41.672 --> 01:00:43.739
Maybe he's working his way
up the ladder.

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:47.242
All right, then let's find
out who's on the ladder.

01:00:47.244 --> 01:00:48.944
Start a board,

01:00:48.946 --> 01:00:51.013

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.416
Not yet.

01:00:54.418 --> 01:00:56.852
He's a suspect in four deaths.

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:58.754
Yeah, and they probably
all earned it.

01:00:58.756 --> 01:01:01.356
They're probably the guys
that killed his family.

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:04.159
And that's a fucking case we
haven't done shit on, isn't it?

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.762
So we're just gonna let him
do our job for us?

01:01:06.764 --> 01:01:08.664
Why not?

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:11.767
- He's more effective than we are.
- All right.

Okay, I'll think about it.

01:13:13.123 --> 01:13:15.123
This isn't a negotiation.

Jean Paul Mcintyre?

01:14:45.248 --> 01:14:47.148
Yes sir. Can I help you?

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:50.218
I got some questions
about John nguyen.

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:52.220
He's a friend of yours, right?

01:14:52.222 --> 01:14:54.522
Did you find out
who killed his family?

01:14:54.524 --> 01:14:56.057
We're working on it.

01:14:56.059 --> 01:14:58.893
Look, John has got himself

01:14:58.895 --> 01:15:02.530
mixed up with some very
dangerous individuals.

01:15:02.532 --> 01:15:04.265
Heh.

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:06.601
That's funny to you?

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:09.270
You ever been in combat?

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:13.107
This is what danger looks like.

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.581
Um, thank you for your service.

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:23.618
I'm sorry about the leg, but
what the fuck is your point?

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.087
What would you do
if it was your family?

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:30.791
What is it with you guys?

01:15:30.793 --> 01:15:33.895
I need information to do my job.

01:15:33.897 --> 01:15:36.597
I can't help if you don't
tell me something.

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:38.533

- <i>(Cellphone ringing)</i>
<i>- Excuse me.</i>

01:16:50.006 --> 01:16:52.206
I was his C.O.

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:56.310
So you understand,
I'm not here officially.

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:00.748
Roger that.

01:17:02.017 --> 01:17:04.986
Army never should have let him out
in the world the way they did.

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:08.022
They treated him like
surplus equipment,

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:12.093
like a car more expensive
to repair than replace.

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:16.631
How you doing, major?

01:17:16.633 --> 01:17:18.866
I ain't broken-down
enough yet, sir,

01:17:18.868 --> 01:17:21.769
- so I'm doing just fine.
- Good.

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:24.705
Is there a particular reason

01:17:24.707 --> 01:17:27.408
- you're here?
- You're gonna hunt him down.

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:30.077
That's what you do.
That's your function.

01:17:30.079 --> 01:17:32.680
Before you do,

01:17:32.682 --> 01:17:35.816
I thought you might like to
know in another time and place

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:38.285
you'd be thanking
the lord almighty Jesus Christ

01:17:38.287 --> 01:17:39.887
he was on your side.

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:43.658
John was a born leader.

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:46.694
And he's a true killer. Cold
as fuck if you're down range.

01:17:46.696 --> 01:17:48.863
But, man,

01:17:48.865 --> 01:17:50.998
he'd take candy bars,

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.267
hand 'em out to little kids

01:17:53.269 --> 01:17:55.336
just to see the look
on their faces.

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:57.838
Volunteer for vaccination details.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.809
You just don't get many men like that.
You know this, Mr. Mitchell.

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:05.746
I just thought someone
should know who he was.

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:08.416
You understand me?

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.719
I think someone out there

01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:13.954
should know who he is.

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:19.093
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:23.431
Hey, Griggs.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.867
What's your recommendation?

01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:29.203
I'd find the men
who killed his family

01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:31.305
and I'd put 'em away.

01:18:31.307 --> 01:18:34.341
Then I'd wait for John
to turn himself in,

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:35.976
because that's what he'll do.

01:18:35.978 --> 01:18:38.079
He won't run from what he's done.

01:18:38.081 --> 01:18:40.214
He's just not wired that way.

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:43.484
He believes in justice.

01:18:43.486 --> 01:18:46.287
And if you can't
deliver it, well then,

01:18:46.289 --> 01:18:49.256
you can be sure as hell John will.

01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:52.960
Good day, Mr. Mitchell.

01:19:08.343 --> 01:19:11.112
What you said really hurt, man,

01:19:11.114 --> 01:19:13.781
but I needed to hear that shit.

01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:18.486
I haven't left this house in weeks.

01:19:18.488 --> 01:19:21.088
Fuckin' weeks.

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:23.491
Every time I go out, some
motherfucker's gotta remind me

01:19:23.493 --> 01:19:25.826
I got my goddamn leg blown off.

01:19:25.828 --> 01:19:27.394
"Oh, we're so proud of you."

01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:29.930
"God bless you, you're so brave."

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:32.867
I see those motherfuckers
eyeballing my prosthetic,

01:19:32.869 --> 01:19:34.969
thinking, "this poor guy."

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:39.807

letting all that pity
make a bitch out of me.

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:48.149
But fuck that shit.

01:27:12.895 --> 01:27:15.729
<i>He was there that night</i>
<i>your family got barbecued.</i>

01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:18.565
<i>I wasn't there myself, but...</i>

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:20.334
<i>From what I heard</i>

01:27:20.336 --> 01:27:23.237
old Cory here had a pretty
good time with your sister.

01:27:23.239 --> 01:27:25.339
Hell,

01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:27.307
we all did. I just got to go first.

01:27:27.309 --> 01:27:29.309
- Fuck you.
- Farragut: Can we speed this up?

01:27:30.812 --> 01:27:32.613
Hollis:
<i>Put the cuffs on him.</i>

01:27:32.615 --> 01:27:33.947
Farragut: <i>Ah, Jesus.</i>

01:27:35.383 --> 01:27:37.351
<i>(Cuffs rattling)</i>

01:27:38.953 --> 01:27:41.355
All right. Kill the gimp.

01:27:41.357 --> 01:27:43.323
- No! You let him go!
- Jeez.

01:27:43.325 --> 01:27:46.293
You got me! You got me!

01:27:46.295 --> 01:27:49.296
- Let him go!
- Hey, aren't you gonna say please, John?

01:27:49.298 --> 01:27:51.465
Please! You got me!

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:56.336
It's cool, bro.

01:27:57.538 --> 01:27:59.840
Look at him.

01:28:04.379 --> 01:28:05.779
- <i>(Knife squelches)</i>
<i>- (Groans)</i>

01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:07.648
No! No!

01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:10.450
- (Gurgles)
- No!

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:13.320
Aah! No!

01:28:13.322 --> 01:28:15.022
No no!

01:28:15.024 --> 01:28:19.559
- <i>No! Oh fuck!</i>
<i>- Jesus Christ.</i>

01:28:19.561 --> 01:28:22.663
- No.
- Jesus, Hollis.

01:28:22.665 --> 01:28:25.365
Don't worry. You'll get your money.

01:28:25.367 --> 01:28:27.334
- You like money, don't you, mark, huh?
- Fuck!

01:28:27.336 --> 01:28:30.304
Getting your pretty little
wife all waxed and botoxed?

01:28:31.606 --> 01:28:33.573
How do you think I get that money?

01:28:33.575 --> 01:28:36.043
What do you think, I was out

01:28:36.045 --> 01:28:39.346
in a red fuckin' Santa suit
ringing a bell? Look at this.

01:28:39.348 --> 01:28:41.682
- (Moans)
- That's the tit you've been sucking on.

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:45.819
All right, Cory.
You think you can take him?

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:49.389
I'm gonna fuck this gook up.

01:28:49.391 --> 01:28:51.325
Take the cuffs off.

01:28:56.698 --> 01:28:58.532
- Sorry.
- You ain't sorry,

01:28:58.534 --> 01:29:00.367
but you will be.

01:29:03.705 --> 01:29:05.105
All right, come on, guys.

01:29:05.107 --> 01:29:06.506
Let's have some fun.

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.894
Don't you wanna know?

01:29:27.896 --> 01:29:29.062
Know what?

01:29:29.064 --> 01:29:30.464
If you still got it.

01:29:30.466 --> 01:29:32.366
Farragut: Finish it, Hollis.

01:29:32.368 --> 01:29:34.434
You got three guns on me.

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:37.738
Don't you wanna see if you can?

01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:40.741
Huh? What is it? You don't
wanna get your hands dirty?

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:48.482
If you want something done...

01:29:48.484 --> 01:29:50.417
Think I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:29:50.419 --> 01:29:51.818
Ugh!

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.053
That's all you got, soldier boy?

01:30:34.495 --> 01:30:35.662
Hollis!

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.468
I got him. Say the word, Hollis!

01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:43.537
(Choking)

01:30:54.682 --> 01:30:56.650
(Screams)

01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:05.559
(Growls)

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:10.697
<i>(Crickets chirping)</i>

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:25.245
John: I'm sorry, man.

01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:28.648
We fucked 'em up though.

01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:30.517
We got 'em.

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:33.253
(Sniffles)

01:31:34.589 --> 01:31:36.122
(Whispers) Fuck 'em.

01:31:47.535 --> 01:31:49.569
You still alive, kid?

01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:57.844
Still wanna know what
happened at the motel?

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:05.685
I got a pretty good idea
what happened there, kiddo.

01:32:07.054 --> 01:32:09.589
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:13.260
- What about all this?
- What about all this?

01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:19.099
I call this in, you're going
to jail for a very long time.

01:32:21.102 --> 01:32:22.736
I know.

01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:26.740
It's not gonna happen.
Not on my watch.

01:32:26.742 --> 01:32:28.608
But you're a cop.

01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:30.710
Yeah, I am.

01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:32.679
And that's not justice.

01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:42.088
This is a, uh,
certain kind of justice.

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:46.226
Everybody here got exactly
what they deserved.

01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:54.301
Except for him.

01:32:57.271 --> 01:32:59.606
He's my friend.

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:05.245
Yeah. He was.

01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:10.283
<i>I got this. Get out of here.</i>

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:35.775
<i>(Engine idling)</i>

01:34:00.868 --> 01:34:03.003
<i>(Bus hisses, door closes)</i>

01:34:04.372 --> 01:34:07.107
John: <i>I know that J.P.
Died with honor.</i>

01:34:10.177 --> 01:34:12.846
<i>And I know that my family</i>
<i>would be proud of me.</i>

01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:20.286
<i>I won't be ashamed and afraid</i>
<i>to see them again someday.</i>

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:27.227
<i>They say what doesn't kill us</i>
<i>makes us stronger.</i>

01:34:30.064 --> 01:34:32.298
<i>I don't know if that's true,</i>

01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:34.901
<i>but I know that</i>
<i>the nightmares have subsided.</i>
