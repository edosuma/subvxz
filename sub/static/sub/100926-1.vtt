WEBVTT

00:41.175 --> 00:42.908
- Stop it!
- You're in my space!

00:44.178 --> 00:46.080
Hey, hey hey!

00:47.114 --> 00:49.882
You guys
just got here.

00:49.884 --> 00:52.151
You two are gonna have a
lot more fun this weekend

00:52.153 --> 00:53.953
if you learn
to get along.

00:53.955 --> 00:55.955
Mm-hmm.

00:55.957 --> 00:59.424
You're gonna turn
your brains to mush.

00:59.426 --> 01:01.026
Well, there's nothing
to do and I'm bored.

01:01.028 --> 01:03.162
How about
reading a book?

01:03.164 --> 01:04.464
No, thanks.

01:06.766 --> 01:08.666
All right, that's it.

01:08.668 --> 01:11.203
Give 'em here.
Here we go, hand them over.

01:11.205 --> 01:14.039
You can do without your
phones for one night.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.041
You'll get them back
in the morning.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.676
So what are we
gonna do all night?

01:18.678 --> 01:21.715
Why don't we just
enjoy each other's company?

01:22.749 --> 01:25.450
I remember
when I was a boy...

01:25.452 --> 01:27.552
my grandfather
used to tell me

01:27.554 --> 01:29.422
the most amazing stories...

01:30.825 --> 01:34.860
and I really
miss those days.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.761
What else
was there to do?

01:36.763 --> 01:38.563
Oh...

01:38.565 --> 01:40.665
Well, I suppose
you're not interested

01:40.667 --> 01:44.870
in the true story of the
mansion with the secret doorway.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.171
What's the story about?

01:46.173 --> 01:49.574
Well, it's got heroes
and villains,

01:49.576 --> 01:52.878
and adventure,
and... magic...

01:52.880 --> 01:56.614
But you guys probably don't
wanna hear about all that.

02:01.022 --> 02:05.523
"It all started
on a beautiful sunny day.

02:05.525 --> 02:08.928
<i>The mansion sat
on many acres,</i>

02:08.930 --> 02:12.766
<i>like a small castle in the
middle of its own kingdom."</i>

04:22.830 --> 04:25.632
Rufus, hide.
She's coming.

04:34.741 --> 04:36.208
You're not getting away
this time.

04:36.210 --> 04:38.210
- Give me the book.
- Yeah.

04:38.212 --> 04:39.411
How about no?

04:42.016 --> 04:43.916
I've grown just as powerful
as you, Abbott.

04:43.918 --> 04:47.186
More evil? Definitely.
Just as powerful? We'll see.

04:50.024 --> 04:51.256
Give up this fight.

04:51.258 --> 04:52.991
Can't you see I'm trying
to save our world?

04:52.993 --> 04:55.027
Our world isn't
worth saving.

04:55.029 --> 04:57.296
Every world
is worth saving.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.730
Oh, just give me
the book, Abbott!

05:05.772 --> 05:08.739
Is this what you want?
Then go and get it!

05:08.741 --> 05:09.942
No!

05:09.944 --> 05:11.178
<i>Prohibulamos!</i>

05:14.949 --> 05:17.650
Rufus...

05:18.986 --> 05:20.154
Get out of here.

05:23.756 --> 05:25.326
Open!

05:34.734 --> 05:37.838
<i>Cengail imperio!</i>

05:44.111 --> 05:45.745
Abbot!

05:46.847 --> 05:48.180
Where's the amulet?

05:51.986 --> 05:54.155
How dare he
bind my powers?

06:01.328 --> 06:03.097
Hello?

06:05.199 --> 06:06.433
Hello?

06:07.801 --> 06:10.371
Is anybody here?

06:20.114 --> 06:22.414
Wait a minute.
You're telling me

06:22.416 --> 06:25.284
that there's secret portals
in someone's mansion

06:25.286 --> 06:26.751
and there was
a wizard battle?

06:26.753 --> 06:28.786
Exactly as I said.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.455
And a raccoon
came through it.

06:30.457 --> 06:33.492
- Not a raccoon!
- Then what was it?

06:33.494 --> 06:38.063
- Probably just a dog.
- Not a raccoon, or a dog.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.799
Do you want me to read
you the story or not?

06:40.801 --> 06:43.969
We're sorry.
I wanna know what it was.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.470
You'll find out
soon enough,

06:45.472 --> 06:47.806
just like Scott
and Emily did.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.075
Who were they?

06:50.077 --> 06:53.879
"Scott's grandmother owned the
mansion, you see.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.081
<i>And one fateful day,</i>

06:56.083 --> 07:00.254
<i>Scott and Emily became
part of the tale."</i>

07:22.376 --> 07:25.911
Emily, you have
the most beautiful smile.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.412
- Thank you!
- Don't you think so, Scott?

07:27.414 --> 07:29.316
- Mom...
- Just saying.

07:34.255 --> 07:36.188
Why didn't you tell me
they were here?

07:36.190 --> 07:38.190
All right, Mom.
We literally just got here.

07:38.192 --> 07:40.359
Oh...
Look at you!

07:40.361 --> 07:42.227
You're as tall
as your mother.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.462
- Hi, Grandma.
- Clara.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.397
- Hi, Mom.
- Mmm.

07:45.399 --> 07:49.268
Listen, do you have time
for tea before your flight?

07:49.270 --> 07:50.502
Good, good.

07:50.504 --> 07:54.206
She has been waiting
for over an hour...

07:54.208 --> 07:55.941
for you.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.414
Edgar, take their things
upstairs.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.021
I'll take care
of that.

08:12.159 --> 08:16.395
Scott! How lovely
to see you again.

08:16.397 --> 08:18.232
- And...
- Emily.

08:25.506 --> 08:28.040
Edgar, Lilith,
Norman.

08:28.042 --> 08:30.609
Nice to see you again.
It's been a while.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.344
It's Blade now.

08:32.346 --> 08:35.179
- What?
- I go by Blade.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.616
It's mysterious
and strong.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.051
Don't you think?

08:39.053 --> 08:40.187
No.

08:41.522 --> 08:44.155
Norman, Edgar and I
will be here for you

08:44.158 --> 08:45.993
should there be
anything you need.

08:51.465 --> 08:54.266
This house is amazing!

08:54.268 --> 08:57.269
When I was little, this place felt so...
big and scary.

08:57.271 --> 08:58.670
Oh, no.

08:58.672 --> 09:02.174
It's still just
as scary at night.

09:02.176 --> 09:04.976
Especially since your grandma
locked some of the rooms

09:04.978 --> 09:06.678
and won't let anybody
in them.

09:06.680 --> 09:12.019
And every night I hear sounds
coming from the same room.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.420
What do you
think it is?

09:15.422 --> 09:18.256
- Scott?
- I don't know.

09:19.993 --> 09:23.497
I think it's a body.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.299
A dead body.

09:27.301 --> 09:30.404
How is a dead body
making noises?

09:32.406 --> 09:34.539
Come on, let's go.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.277
What are you
doing, Edgar?

09:39.279 --> 09:41.279
I was just giving them
a hard time.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.181
Yes, well, let's not
have them snooping around

09:43.183 --> 09:45.317
where they don't belong.

09:45.319 --> 09:49.089
Get back to work or I'll
have you digging ditches.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.895
I want this one
over there.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.345
- Scott!
- What's up?

10:13.347 --> 10:14.681
I saw something
up there.

10:17.384 --> 10:20.118
That dude needs
a vacation.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.621
No, not Edgar.
I saw something else.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.492
Uh, can't hear you.
Music's too loud.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.134
Anything
worth selling?

11:09.136 --> 11:11.436
Shoot, I can't
see anything.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.339
We better get back before the old
bat notices that we're missing.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.441
Which one?

11:16.443 --> 11:19.478
I don't know.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.200
Hey! What's up?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.568
What are you doing here?

11:43.570 --> 11:45.537
I had to wait for
everyone to go to bed.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.573
Emily, we're not
little kids anymore.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.642
- You're gonna get me in trouble.
- Relax!

11:55.817 --> 11:57.850
- You're not leaving, are you?
- No.

12:00.855 --> 12:02.289
Are you going
to the school dance?

12:03.524 --> 12:07.125
I was thinking
about asking Megan.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.427
Megan. Why her?

12:09.429 --> 12:11.632
I don't know,
she seems... nice.

12:13.367 --> 12:15.669
You don't even know her.
She doesn't know you exist.

12:17.771 --> 12:20.205
Who are you going with?

12:20.207 --> 12:23.210
I don't know, might just...
stay at home.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.649
- I'll play you.
- You're on!

12:35.823 --> 12:39.192
- <i>Player 2 wins!</i>
- Come on!

13:10.892 --> 13:12.225
Scott.

13:13.527 --> 13:14.759
Scott, I heard
something.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.562
You're still here?
What time is it?

13:17.564 --> 13:20.265
I don't know.
I heard some weird noises.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.902
Maybe it's just Dracula
going out for a bite.

13:22.904 --> 13:24.569
I'm serious.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.806
Look, this house
is just old.

13:26.808 --> 13:29.341
- Don't let it get to you.
- Let's go check it out.

13:29.343 --> 13:30.675
All right, fine!

13:30.677 --> 13:33.180
But then you're going home
and I'm going to bed.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.264
You heard it that time?

13:56.637 --> 13:58.503
It's locked.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.641
It's coming
from that way.

14:13.720 --> 14:17.288
Stop it! You scared me!

14:17.290 --> 14:19.992
Don't frighten
your sister, Peter.

14:19.994 --> 14:22.427
It's okay
to be scared, though.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.830
I get scared myself
at times.

14:24.832 --> 14:28.266
Without fear,
there can be no courage.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.635
Now, let's see,
where was I?

14:30.637 --> 14:32.504
Oh, yes.

14:32.506 --> 14:36.708
"Emily and Scott
burst into the room."

14:36.710 --> 14:38.743
What are you guys
doing in here?

14:38.745 --> 14:40.846
It's the middle
of the night.

14:40.848 --> 14:43.314
We couldn't sleep,
so we just wanted to come in and...

14:43.316 --> 14:44.384
Read.

14:45.953 --> 14:48.353
You should go on
back to bed now.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.323
We apologize
for waking you.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.799
That was close.

14:59.801 --> 15:02.367
- Be quiet, Norman.
- I told you it's Blade!

15:02.369 --> 15:04.536
- Make me!
- Ugh! Stop it, you two.

15:04.538 --> 15:06.972
It's getting really hard
to take stuff from this house

15:06.974 --> 15:08.573
without being noticed.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.308
No, we need to find out
what's in there.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.743
There's nothing in there
of any value.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.346
I checked it years ago.

15:15.615 --> 15:16.882
Just remember...

15:16.884 --> 15:21.621
if you find any jewelry,
show it to me first.

15:24.025 --> 15:25.792
Turds.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.902
- I don't trust them.
- Me either, especially Lilith.

15:36.904 --> 15:39.437
There's something about
the way she looks at us.

15:47.748 --> 15:50.918
It will be fine.
It's just an old house, remember?

16:07.400 --> 16:10.537
- It's probably just a mouse.
- Yeah...

16:11.605 --> 16:13.306
Just a mouse.

16:42.702 --> 16:43.969
Ow!

16:46.007 --> 16:47.672
Wait! It's okay!

16:57.751 --> 17:01.655
- What's going on in there?
- I don't know! I'm not in there!

17:04.058 --> 17:05.325
There.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.964
- What is that thing?
- I don't know.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.363
We're not gonna hurt you.

17:52.639 --> 17:56.141
That's it.
Come on out.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.846
It's so cute.

18:08.055 --> 18:09.489
What the...

18:11.993 --> 18:13.593
Be careful!

18:15.729 --> 18:16.996
Hello.

18:16.998 --> 18:18.663
I wanna see.
I wanna look.

18:18.665 --> 18:21.901
There's some kind
of creature in there.

18:21.903 --> 18:24.502
But I can't get
a good look at it.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.406
I'm Emily.

18:27.975 --> 18:30.242
- This is my friend...
- Scott.

18:30.244 --> 18:32.577
You can talk?!

18:32.579 --> 18:34.013
Of course I can!

18:34.015 --> 18:36.547
I'm not a common raccoon
digging in the trash.

18:36.549 --> 18:40.551
Ahem. My name is Rufus.
Pleased to finally meet you.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.221
How do you know
my name?

18:42.223 --> 18:45.024
Your grandfather talked
about you all the time.

18:45.026 --> 18:46.091
How long have you
been here?

18:46.093 --> 18:47.893
Hmm. A few years now.

18:47.895 --> 18:50.628
Does my grandma know?

18:50.630 --> 18:53.966
No. After your grandfather
died, I kept hidden.

18:53.968 --> 18:55.935
- I wanna look!
- Hush, Norman!

18:55.937 --> 18:57.970
I told you
it's Blade now.

19:00.774 --> 19:03.978
Nice to meet you, Blade.
I'm Toilet Paper.

19:09.150 --> 19:12.650
- Where did you come from?
- Are you an alien?

19:12.652 --> 19:14.752
Hm. I don't think so.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.822
I come from the land
of Alainn,

19:16.824 --> 19:19.691
a magical world in a
kingdom parallel to yours.

19:19.693 --> 19:21.592
Cool! I'd like
to see it.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.829
Oh! You would have
loved it when it was lush.

19:23.831 --> 19:25.831
Flowers of every color
you can imagine,

19:25.833 --> 19:28.867
and rolling fields of
shimmering fairywing grass.

19:28.869 --> 19:33.571
Fairywing grass.
Sounds beautiful.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.874
Oh, it was.

19:35.876 --> 19:38.143
But sadly,
it's all gone.

19:38.145 --> 19:41.246
- What happened?
- We didn't take care of our world.

19:41.248 --> 19:44.116
There's a darkness
that covers the land.

19:44.118 --> 19:47.286
It's become dry and grey.

19:47.288 --> 19:49.622
My world is dying.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.560
I wanna see!
Let me see!

19:55.562 --> 19:56.629
Come on!

19:59.566 --> 20:01.266
Whoa!

20:01.268 --> 20:03.869
You came here
to escape?

20:03.871 --> 20:05.670
No, no, not to escape.

20:05.672 --> 20:08.173
Our Queen sent us here
on a quest to save my world

20:08.175 --> 20:10.009
and stop its extinction.

20:10.011 --> 20:11.609
But of course,
we were followed here

20:11.611 --> 20:14.346
- by an evil witch...
- Wait. You said "we."

20:14.348 --> 20:16.714
Oh, Abbott,
the Queen's head wizard.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.717
We got separated when he was
fighting the sorceress Lilith.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.087
No way!

20:22.089 --> 20:24.823
Did that thing just say
Lilith is an evil sorceress?

20:24.825 --> 20:26.358
If Lilith is a sorceress,

20:26.360 --> 20:28.093
I really am toilet paper.

20:28.095 --> 20:29.928
I can still
be Blade, right?

20:31.664 --> 20:33.765
I knew there was someting
not right about her.

20:33.767 --> 20:36.935
She's no threat.
Abbott's last spell bound her powers.

20:36.937 --> 20:40.806
Wizards? Magic doorways?
Lilith, a sorceress?

20:40.808 --> 20:43.741
- This is crazy!
- Scott, open your eyes.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.146
This is real.

20:46.147 --> 20:47.913
You said Alainn is dying,

20:47.915 --> 20:50.949
and you've been here
for years.

20:50.951 --> 20:52.851
How do you know
your world still exists?

20:52.853 --> 20:54.987
It does. Traveling
between worlds

20:54.989 --> 20:57.856
distorts time somehow.
I don't understand it completely.

20:57.858 --> 21:00.194
This is the door
between worlds.

21:06.901 --> 21:11.270
- There's nothing here.
- See? I told you. Crazy.

21:11.272 --> 21:13.172
There's something
there all right.

21:13.174 --> 21:15.240
You just need to have
the key.

21:15.242 --> 21:18.177
This is Abbott's amulet.

21:18.179 --> 21:21.880
With it, certain doorways
can lead to anywhere.

21:21.882 --> 21:23.317
Abbott is trapped
somewhere behind that one.

21:30.424 --> 21:34.326
- Just a closet.
- Trust me, it's a lot more than a closet.

21:34.328 --> 21:36.061
I wish I knew
how to use this.

21:36.063 --> 21:38.332
- It has writing I can't read.
- Here, let me see it.

21:41.102 --> 21:42.868
Your grandfather
wanted to help me,

21:42.870 --> 21:44.937
but he was too ill.

21:44.939 --> 21:47.772
He said if anyone could help,
it'd be you, Scott.

21:47.774 --> 21:51.210
He said you had his spirit and the
strength for a quest like this.

21:51.212 --> 21:54.980
Well, I don't know
who he was talking about.

21:54.982 --> 21:58.783
- That's not me.
- You might surprise yourself, Scott.

21:58.785 --> 22:02.154
Please, help me
find Abbott.

22:02.156 --> 22:04.022
I don't know...

22:04.024 --> 22:05.190
He can't do it
alone, Scott.

22:05.192 --> 22:07.692
Otherwise, he'd be
home by now.

22:07.694 --> 22:10.129
I just... don't know
if I can do it.

22:10.131 --> 22:12.833
It doesn't have to be just you.
You've got me.

22:14.201 --> 22:15.400
<i>Hold on
for a minute.</i>

22:15.402 --> 22:16.935
You're making this all up.

22:16.937 --> 22:19.304
Sarah might believe you,
but I don't.

22:19.306 --> 22:21.273
I don't think Grandad
would lie to us.

22:21.275 --> 22:23.944
Never have.
Never will.

22:25.279 --> 22:28.046
"Rufus' world
had a chance to be saved,

22:28.048 --> 22:31.782
but Scott didn't know if he had
the courage for such a quest."

22:31.784 --> 22:33.452
So what did he do?

22:33.454 --> 22:35.786
What would <i>you</i> do?

22:35.788 --> 22:38.957
I'd do it.
No question.

22:38.959 --> 22:40.993
If your grandpa
was standing right here,

22:40.995 --> 22:42.928
would you tell him "no"?

22:42.930 --> 22:45.364
He wanted to help Rufus
and he couldn't.

22:45.366 --> 22:48.066
You can.

22:48.068 --> 22:49.837
Hmm.

22:51.105 --> 22:54.373
Okay. We're in.

22:54.375 --> 22:56.041
Oh, thank you!
Thank you!

22:56.043 --> 22:57.742
Not too loud!

22:57.744 --> 23:00.045
- You don't wanna wake grandma!
- Sorry.

23:00.047 --> 23:01.513
They're gonna
help that thing!

23:01.515 --> 23:03.250
We better tell
Lilith.

23:10.257 --> 23:11.458
Look.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.429
I know what this is.
It's Latin.

23:17.364 --> 23:22.367
<i>"Quod ostium sit in mente
dico aperta."</i>

23:22.369 --> 23:25.204
- Can you translate it?
- Give me a second.

23:25.206 --> 23:28.140
This is "say open."

23:28.142 --> 23:31.910
And this means "in the
brain" or "in the mind."

23:31.912 --> 23:33.845
Something isn't right.

23:33.847 --> 23:36.817
In the mind...

23:37.985 --> 23:41.520
In the mind...
in the mind...

23:41.522 --> 23:44.323
A door! The door
is in the mind!

23:44.325 --> 23:47.192
Okay...
what does that mean?

23:47.194 --> 23:50.195
Rufus... did Abbott
go in someone's brain?

23:50.197 --> 23:52.564
Don't be silly.
He'd never fit.

23:52.566 --> 23:56.003
Guys! What does
the brain do?

23:57.871 --> 23:59.871
It thinks!

23:59.873 --> 24:03.244
Just picture the place you wanna
go and ask the door to open.

24:05.045 --> 24:07.045
Think of where Abbott is.

24:07.047 --> 24:09.081
I'm thinking
the forest,

24:09.083 --> 24:11.917
where Abbott is trapped.

24:11.919 --> 24:13.552
Open!

24:50.157 --> 24:51.556
Where is he?

24:51.558 --> 24:54.393
He wouldn't have gone
too far from the door.

24:54.395 --> 24:57.296
- Abbott!
- Abbott!

24:57.298 --> 24:59.097
We've come
to rescue you!

24:59.099 --> 25:01.633
It's me!
It's Rufus!

25:05.439 --> 25:07.172
- Where are they?
- They were just here.

25:07.174 --> 25:08.440
The big rat said
something about an amulet.

25:08.442 --> 25:09.975
They found the amulet?

25:09.977 --> 25:11.410
I don't know,
I couldn't see everything.

25:11.412 --> 25:14.646
It is not easy
listening through a wall!

25:14.648 --> 25:17.249
Uh... we did hear them say
you were a sorceress, though.

25:17.251 --> 25:18.585
Is that true?

25:19.620 --> 25:21.620
Maybe it is.

25:21.622 --> 25:24.022
So maybe you should
go find them...

25:24.024 --> 25:26.226
before I turn you both
into mice!

25:43.911 --> 25:45.677
Hmm.

25:45.679 --> 25:47.114
Oh! Oh!

25:51.352 --> 25:54.553
The end. What do you
want to do now?

25:54.555 --> 25:58.390
What?! Best ending <i>ever!</i>

25:58.392 --> 26:01.560
Very funny, Grandad.
Keep going.

26:01.562 --> 26:04.162
Okay.
Okay, you got me.

26:05.399 --> 26:08.967
"Scott and Emily
were alone in the forest,

26:08.969 --> 26:12.938
<i>wondering if they would ever
see their new friend again."</i>

26:12.940 --> 26:14.441
Whoa!

26:18.278 --> 26:19.444
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:19.446 --> 26:21.346
Hey, hey, hey, no!
No, no! No!

26:21.348 --> 26:23.949
No! No! Whoa!

26:23.951 --> 26:26.987
Ah! Ah! Ah!

26:28.622 --> 26:31.523
Maybe you should try
something else!

26:31.525 --> 26:33.291
Okay, fair enough! Uh...

26:33.293 --> 26:36.128
Ah, here we go! And...

26:37.464 --> 26:39.531
Ha!

26:45.272 --> 26:47.139
I can't believe
that worked!

26:47.141 --> 26:48.473
Ha!

26:48.475 --> 26:51.576
Are you okay?

26:51.578 --> 26:53.645
Yes!

26:53.647 --> 26:55.147
I'm fine.

26:57.017 --> 27:00.118
May I introduce the queen
of Alainn's head wizard,

27:00.120 --> 27:02.053
the great Sir Abbott?

27:04.324 --> 27:06.992
How exciting!
Where is he?

27:06.994 --> 27:10.729
Oh, boy! Lilith must've
really scrambled your brains.

27:10.731 --> 27:13.233
You're Abbott!
The Great Wizard!

27:14.735 --> 27:16.668
Me? Abbott?

27:16.670 --> 27:19.271
Well, the name
does sound familiar.

27:19.273 --> 27:21.740
Explains why
I can do this.

27:21.742 --> 27:23.742
- Whoa!
- Unfortunately,

27:23.744 --> 27:25.444
it's the only magic
I can remember.

27:25.446 --> 27:27.078
Ah, this is bad.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.680
- What's wrong?
- We're gonna need Abbott

27:28.682 --> 27:30.582
back to his old self again.

27:30.584 --> 27:32.219
Milady?

27:35.122 --> 27:37.522
Come on. Let's head
back to the mansion.

27:37.524 --> 27:39.624
You know, I was
in a mansion once.

27:39.626 --> 27:42.260
Terrible experience.
Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

27:42.262 --> 27:45.966
Unreasonably windy.
Also I remember it being extremely dusty.

27:52.639 --> 27:54.208
It's morning?

27:57.110 --> 28:00.278
I remember
this place.

28:00.280 --> 28:03.317
Um... where's
your spellbook?

28:04.651 --> 28:07.552
Yes! My spellbook!

28:07.554 --> 28:10.388
Passed down from wizard
to wizard for a thousand years!

28:10.390 --> 28:14.226
It contains spells to conjure
wonders beyond your imagination.

28:14.228 --> 28:16.261
And if it ever fell
into the wrong hands,

28:16.263 --> 28:19.066
it could end this universe
<i>as we know it!</i>

28:21.803 --> 28:23.836
You're forgetting
the most important thing.

28:23.838 --> 28:26.304
The book contains the spell
to create the magic dust

28:26.306 --> 28:28.240
that will heal our world!

28:28.242 --> 28:31.844
- Where is it, Abbott?
- I couldn't let Lilith have it,

28:31.846 --> 28:35.514
so I sent it to the only place
I could think of at the time.

28:35.516 --> 28:38.552
The National Library,
for some reason.

28:42.256 --> 28:43.790
Here.

28:46.426 --> 28:49.194
- What are we waiting for? Let's go.
- Don't be foolish!

28:49.196 --> 28:51.864
You can't get to the library through
that door! We have to find another door.

28:51.866 --> 28:53.799
That one's attached
to the forest.

28:57.872 --> 29:01.773
But I... smell food!

29:01.775 --> 29:04.175
And I'm not going anywhere
until I get a decent meal!

29:04.177 --> 29:06.711
Oh! I can't stomach
another squirrel.

29:06.713 --> 29:08.613
- No offense, Rufus.
- None taken.

29:08.615 --> 29:10.448
I'll go get us
something to eat.

29:10.450 --> 29:13.285
Emily, make sure
he stays here.

29:15.890 --> 29:17.622
Yeah, no.
We're gonna stay here.

29:17.624 --> 29:19.591
- He's gonna bring us some food.
- Oh...

29:19.593 --> 29:22.462
There's nothing to do here.
I've read all these books.

29:36.410 --> 29:38.677
You know...

29:38.679 --> 29:42.380
I think... it's starting
to come back to me.

29:42.382 --> 29:45.550
Oh, great. If Lilith
doesn't kill us,

29:45.552 --> 29:47.087
he just might.

29:53.293 --> 29:54.361
Good morning.

29:55.897 --> 29:58.763
I already ate breakfast.
I thought I'd let you sleep in.

29:58.765 --> 30:00.532
- Thanks.
- Did you sleep well?

30:00.534 --> 30:02.434
Yeah. I'm fine.

30:02.436 --> 30:05.303
So, what do you and Emily
have planned for today?

30:05.305 --> 30:06.605
I think we're gonna go
to the library.

30:06.607 --> 30:08.673
I was just about
to head to her house.

30:08.675 --> 30:10.843
Her parents are going to drive
us, if that's okay with you.

30:10.845 --> 30:12.444
Oh, it's fine, dear.

30:12.446 --> 30:15.246
I have a meeting with the local
ladies' flower club,

30:15.248 --> 30:17.515
so I'll be gone
most of the day myself.

30:17.517 --> 30:19.720
- So have fun.
- We will. You too.

30:22.623 --> 30:24.789
So, the experiment
goes horribly wrong,

30:24.791 --> 30:27.225
we have to shave
all of Rufus' fur off,

30:27.227 --> 30:29.194
and he looks sort of
like a wrinkly old man

30:29.196 --> 30:31.696
or a hot dog with wrinkles.
It was-it was hilarious.

30:31.698 --> 30:34.699
Ah. Food! Oh,
and you've got grapes!

30:34.701 --> 30:36.568
Oh, I missed grapes.
I love grapes. Mwah!

30:36.570 --> 30:37.870
Did you see Lilith?

30:37.872 --> 30:39.304
- No.
- Mwah!

30:39.306 --> 30:40.873
- We need to go. Now.
- Wait.

30:40.875 --> 30:44.643
People at the library are going
to flip when they see you.

30:44.645 --> 30:47.180
Here. This should work.

30:49.683 --> 30:50.816
Uh, no. No.

30:50.818 --> 30:53.218
No way. No way!

30:53.220 --> 30:54.586
Sorry, Rufus.

30:54.588 --> 30:56.655
We're gonna need you
to hide in here.

30:56.657 --> 30:59.292
Fine.

31:05.298 --> 31:06.731
Hmm. How degrading.

31:06.733 --> 31:09.835
You are one hairy baby!

31:09.837 --> 31:13.271
This is perfect.

31:13.273 --> 31:15.607
You know, I almost forgot
how aggravating you can be.

31:15.609 --> 31:17.676
I am never
gonna forget this.

31:17.678 --> 31:19.646
Open!

31:38.799 --> 31:40.532
Get me out
of this thing!

31:40.534 --> 31:42.369
I barely fit in here.

31:43.805 --> 31:45.370
Abbott, I want out of here.

31:45.372 --> 31:47.372
You gotta be quiet,
Rufus.

31:47.374 --> 31:49.809
What's going on out there?
I can't see anything.

31:49.811 --> 31:52.477
- Shh!
- Seriously?

31:52.479 --> 31:54.412
Abbott, she just
shushed me.

31:54.414 --> 31:56.281
- That's enough out of you.
- Hey!

31:56.283 --> 32:01.053
Oh, what a darling carriage!
Let me take a look at the angel.

32:01.055 --> 32:03.321
Beat it, lady.

32:03.323 --> 32:06.560
Security!
Security!

32:07.895 --> 32:09.895
Ow!

32:09.897 --> 32:12.865
Do you have to hit
every... single... step?

32:12.867 --> 32:15.533
Aww, is somebody cranky?
Do you need your bottle?

32:15.535 --> 32:17.469
Don't make me
hop out of here.

32:17.471 --> 32:19.706
Quiet, Rufus.
Babies don't talk.

32:22.009 --> 32:24.676
Here we are.

32:24.678 --> 32:26.377
Now let's see.

32:26.379 --> 32:29.815
M for "magic."
S for "spell book ."

32:29.817 --> 32:31.316
C for "cookbook?"

32:31.318 --> 32:33.418
- Cookbook?
- Yes.

32:33.420 --> 32:35.955
I have a secret recipe for the most
delicious chocolate chip cookies

32:35.957 --> 32:38.623
you've ever had.

32:38.625 --> 32:40.558
Those must be
some really good cookies.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.895
They are, and let's
put it this way.

32:42.897 --> 32:46.331
If that recipe ever fell
into the wrong hands,

32:46.333 --> 32:49.534
it could send humanity
spiraling...

32:49.536 --> 32:52.470
back into the Dark Ages.

32:52.472 --> 32:55.540
Oh, I remember! Ha!

32:55.542 --> 32:58.944
It's in the Great Reading Room!

32:58.946 --> 33:01.847
Shh!

33:01.849 --> 33:04.351
- Sorry! Sorry.
- Shh!

33:09.456 --> 33:12.925
So what we're looking for
is old, leathery, magical,

33:12.927 --> 33:15.828
and sort of book-shaped.

33:23.637 --> 33:26.038
My Grandpa used to
read this to me as kid.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.539
Ah,
Master Tolkien.

33:27.541 --> 33:29.707
One of the great record
keepers of our time.

33:29.709 --> 33:32.510
You know my grandfather was actually
at the Battle of the Five Armies?

33:32.512 --> 33:34.646
What?! The things
he wrote about are real?

33:34.648 --> 33:36.548
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Some stories are true.

33:36.550 --> 33:37.684
Big whoop.
Let's move on.

33:40.487 --> 33:41.619
<i>Hold on.</i>

33:41.621 --> 33:42.955
Do you know
what this means?

33:42.957 --> 33:44.756
Unicorns and fairies
could be real!

33:44.758 --> 33:47.759
Oh! And dragons!
Giants and ogres!

33:47.761 --> 33:50.129
And all kinds of things
that could eat you!

33:50.131 --> 33:52.797
I think you guys
are missing the point.

33:52.799 --> 33:55.466
Do you want to find out
what happens next or not?

33:55.468 --> 33:58.871
Rufus and Abbott are going
to find the book! I know it.

33:58.873 --> 34:00.873
Let's find out.

34:00.875 --> 34:04.176
What about this?
No. Good book.

34:19.759 --> 34:21.759
Now what?

34:21.761 --> 34:23.661
Just a slight delay,
Rufus, and shh.

34:27.034 --> 34:29.136
Guys. I see it.

34:30.137 --> 34:32.103
I see the book.

34:36.811 --> 34:38.578
How are we
going to get it?

34:39.880 --> 34:41.612
They're gonna catch us.

34:41.614 --> 34:42.984
I got this.

34:44.018 --> 34:45.485
You guys get the book.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.755
Well, follow me.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.027
Grab Rufus.

34:56.898 --> 34:58.998
Hello?

34:59.000 --> 35:02.700
Excuse me.
Someone's drawing in the books.

35:02.702 --> 35:06.038
I don't know the title, but one of
them has "first edition" printed on it.

35:06.040 --> 35:09.174
- Where?
- The back table.

35:31.198 --> 35:33.700
Watch this.
This takes skill.

35:41.175 --> 35:43.508
I guess I'm not as good as I thought.
Hmm... All right.

35:45.779 --> 35:48.648
The doors are locked!
We're trapped!

35:50.617 --> 35:52.086
Run for the door!

35:53.653 --> 35:56.989
- Get the amulet, Scott!
- We are going to jail.

36:04.798 --> 36:07.232
Sorry. Sorry.
Oh, no...

36:07.234 --> 36:09.536
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me!

36:25.953 --> 36:27.618
Scott!

36:27.620 --> 36:29.288
Come on! Let's get back
to the house!

36:29.290 --> 36:31.123
Where's Abbott?

36:31.125 --> 36:32.625
Got it!

36:34.962 --> 36:37.029
All right.
Hold on, Rufus.

36:37.031 --> 36:38.931
- Ramming speed!
- What?

36:38.933 --> 36:40.833
Whoa!

36:43.938 --> 36:45.237
Sorry, boyos.

36:47.574 --> 36:48.876
<i>Lacaris!</i>

36:53.047 --> 36:55.916
Oh, how I've missed you,
old friend. Mwah!

36:57.684 --> 36:59.684
Ow, ow, ow,

36:59.686 --> 37:03.188
ow, ow, ow, ow.

37:09.729 --> 37:11.796
I don't feel so good.

37:11.798 --> 37:13.932
- What is that?
- What are you looking at?!

37:18.072 --> 37:20.540
Rufus, we don't have
time for this. Come on!

37:25.745 --> 37:27.279
- Hey!
- Open!

37:27.281 --> 37:29.214
You gotta check that book out
before you leave!

37:29.216 --> 37:31.183
Actually, thank you so much
for keeping it safe,

37:31.185 --> 37:33.684
but you should really consider
upgrading your security.

37:42.363 --> 37:43.896
What were you thinking?

37:43.898 --> 37:45.898
What? We got the book,
didn't we?

37:45.900 --> 37:48.633
So, I guess you can go home
and save your world.

37:48.635 --> 37:51.303
Not yet. The book's
just the beginning.

37:51.305 --> 37:53.638
Most of the elements we need
for the spell are in your world,

37:53.640 --> 37:55.107
which is why we are here
in the first place.

37:55.109 --> 37:56.741
What elements?

37:56.743 --> 37:59.011
It's why I need the book.
Can't remember.

37:59.013 --> 38:01.814
Let's see here.
We have...

38:01.816 --> 38:04.715
Transformations, curses,

38:04.717 --> 38:06.819
summoning dragons.

38:06.821 --> 38:08.020
Love potions?

38:08.022 --> 38:11.223
Oh, no, no.

38:11.225 --> 38:13.826
Ah. Here we are.

38:13.828 --> 38:16.864
The spell
to heal my world!

38:17.932 --> 38:20.332
What? It's important
and simple.

38:20.334 --> 38:22.101
We only need
four elements...

38:22.103 --> 38:24.069
The bone of a dinosaur,

38:24.071 --> 38:25.670
the bark of a
thousand-year-old olive tree,

38:25.672 --> 38:28.140
and some volcanic stone.
Perfect!

38:28.142 --> 38:30.175
Wait. But you said four.

38:30.177 --> 38:31.443
That's only three.

38:31.445 --> 38:37.182
Well, we... already have
the fourth element.

38:37.184 --> 38:39.451
What is it?

38:39.453 --> 38:43.721
Well, it's...
it's a... it's a...

38:43.723 --> 38:45.090
the blood of a beast.

38:45.092 --> 38:47.758
- I'm sorry, what?
- I said it's...

38:47.760 --> 38:49.161
it's the blood
of a beast.

38:49.163 --> 38:50.695
We still
can't understand you.

38:50.697 --> 38:52.464
Oh, fine! It's
the blood of a beast!

38:52.466 --> 38:55.100
Oh, I see.
The beast is me.

38:55.102 --> 38:56.935
When were you planning
on telling me?

38:56.937 --> 38:58.904
Right after you
stab me in the back?

38:58.906 --> 39:02.773
Oh, Rufus.
You're my dearest and oldest friend.

39:02.775 --> 39:04.742
And you are no beast...

39:04.744 --> 39:07.379
but you <i>are</i> covered in fur,
so technically you are.

39:07.381 --> 39:10.215
Oh, come on.

39:10.217 --> 39:11.884
It's only a drop.
It won't even hurt.

39:11.886 --> 39:14.153
Fine. If it's
to save our world.

39:14.155 --> 39:17.022
But if a spell ever
requires wizard blood,

39:17.024 --> 39:19.091
you're in trouble!

39:19.093 --> 39:21.093
See? That's the spirit,
old friend.

39:21.095 --> 39:23.328
All right, who's ready
to save the world?

39:23.330 --> 39:24.795
Whoa!

39:30.371 --> 39:33.005
We're not going to break
into a museum, are we?

39:33.007 --> 39:34.772
I don't want to steal
a dinosaur bone.

39:34.774 --> 39:37.209
We don't have to.
We can just go straight to the source.

39:37.211 --> 39:40.112
There's an undiscovered
archaeological dig site.

39:40.114 --> 39:43.182
We just may have
to dig a bit.

39:43.184 --> 39:44.885
Open!

39:50.891 --> 39:53.192
Abbott!
Give it to me!

39:53.194 --> 39:54.893
Never!

39:57.898 --> 40:01.035
- It's mine!
- Why don't you go get your own book?

40:21.855 --> 40:23.855
Abbott, your book!

40:23.857 --> 40:25.824
What happened?

40:25.826 --> 40:27.194
Oh, no!

40:29.496 --> 40:31.796
Don't worry.

40:31.798 --> 40:34.499
She didn't get
the healing spell.

40:34.501 --> 40:37.269
Oh, no, this is bad,
really bad.

40:37.271 --> 40:38.503
What's wrong?

40:38.505 --> 40:41.073
It's the other pages.

40:41.075 --> 40:42.441
I can't remember
what's on them.

40:42.443 --> 40:46.044
Well. Come on, then.

40:55.089 --> 40:56.488
You got the book.

40:56.490 --> 40:58.523
- You got the book!
- Only half.

40:58.525 --> 41:01.593
I need the whole thing.

41:01.595 --> 41:04.429
Why do you need
that stupid book for anyway?

41:04.431 --> 41:06.498
Is it worth a lot of money?

41:06.500 --> 41:08.867
It's worth more than everything
in this house combined.

41:08.869 --> 41:10.135
Maybe fully intact.

41:10.137 --> 41:12.206
But half an old book
ain't worth nothing.

41:21.148 --> 41:24.449
If you have that book,
you can do magic, right?

41:24.451 --> 41:26.418
- What are you talking about?
- Hear me out.

41:26.420 --> 41:30.922
Lilith, if you get
the whole book,

41:30.924 --> 41:32.257
you could you turn stuff
into gold, right?

41:33.961 --> 41:35.427
My dear, simple man.

41:35.429 --> 41:37.296
If I had the rest
of this book,

41:37.298 --> 41:40.032
I could turn anything
into, well...

41:40.034 --> 41:41.535
anything.

41:43.971 --> 41:45.637
Help me find it

41:45.639 --> 41:50.077
and we'll all be rich
beyond our wildest dreams.

41:54.315 --> 41:55.614
Hey. Where you going?

41:55.616 --> 41:57.482
I'm going to get
my powers back.

41:57.484 --> 42:01.953
You two idiots wait here.
Guard the door.

42:01.955 --> 42:04.925
They'll be back soon enough
with the rest of my book.

42:10.064 --> 42:12.564
- We can't dig all this up.
- We won't have to.

42:12.566 --> 42:14.166
We'll make what we need
come to us.

42:14.168 --> 42:15.969
Now, stand back.

42:19.907 --> 42:21.340
Think he knows
what he's doing?

42:21.342 --> 42:24.309
Oh, come, now!
Have a little faith.

42:25.946 --> 42:28.146
Prehistoric bones
buried deep,

42:28.148 --> 42:30.982
reveal thyselves
at my feet.

42:30.984 --> 42:35.320
<i>Advocabit simul
dinosaurum ossium!</i>

42:42.196 --> 42:45.430
I don't think it worked.

42:45.432 --> 42:47.332
Well, let me look
at the spell book.

42:47.334 --> 42:50.369
Ah. See?
I'm a little rusty.

42:50.371 --> 42:52.671
I said "bones"
and not bone.

42:52.673 --> 42:54.506
- Abbott...
- I seem to have said

42:54.508 --> 42:57.109
"together" rather than alone.
Those words are so similar.

42:59.012 --> 43:00.447
Abbott! Look!

43:09.723 --> 43:11.289
Oh.

43:11.291 --> 43:13.260
Maybe it's... nice?

43:15.429 --> 43:16.930
Not nice! Not nice! Run!

44:01.108 --> 44:02.707
Come on!
Come and get me!

44:10.350 --> 44:12.050
Rufus!

44:12.052 --> 44:13.187
Whoa!

44:14.621 --> 44:17.189
Run! Get out of here!

44:17.191 --> 44:18.425
Open!

44:26.233 --> 44:28.502
- Are you hurt?
- Thanks for saving me.

44:30.170 --> 44:32.771
Aw, how sweet.

44:36.243 --> 44:38.210
- Oh, no.
- I totally saw that coming.

44:38.212 --> 44:39.644
Predictable.

44:39.646 --> 44:41.413
If you're so smart,
then what happens next?

44:41.415 --> 44:43.482
Rufus just got eaten again!

44:43.484 --> 44:45.486
Grandad will tell us
if you stop interrupting.

44:48.155 --> 44:52.057
"It was going to take
powerful magic to save Rufus.

44:52.059 --> 44:56.328
Unfortunately, Abbott wasn't
quite the wizard he used to be."

44:58.198 --> 45:00.732
A little help would be nice!

45:00.734 --> 45:02.334
Come on, Abbott!

45:04.705 --> 45:06.605
What are you doing?!

45:06.607 --> 45:10.108
Gah! I'm trying
my best here, Rufus!

45:26.760 --> 45:28.828
Ha... oh! Oh!

45:38.338 --> 45:40.405
Run! Run, Rufus, run!

45:40.407 --> 45:42.674
Open! Run, run, run, run!

45:53.487 --> 45:56.688
Oh... oh...

45:56.690 --> 45:58.256
Uh, where are you going?

45:58.258 --> 46:00.392
What do you mean,
where am I going?

46:00.394 --> 46:01.827
We've got to go get
the olive tree bark.

46:01.829 --> 46:03.662
What about Scott
and Emily?

46:03.664 --> 46:05.497
What about them?

46:05.499 --> 46:07.334
They're not here.

46:12.539 --> 46:14.773
You're right.
They're not here.

46:14.775 --> 46:17.175
Don't just stand there.

46:17.177 --> 46:18.844
We've gotta go find them!

46:18.846 --> 46:21.513
Hey! Aren't you
forgetting something?

46:24.318 --> 46:27.419
I am not
gonna ask you guys again!

46:27.421 --> 46:29.354
Give me the book!

46:29.356 --> 46:31.723
You already checked us.
We obviously don't have it.

46:31.725 --> 46:33.491
Don't get smart
with me, girl.

46:33.493 --> 46:35.794
I have a feeling everything
is smart compared to you.

46:35.796 --> 46:37.429
I oughta...

46:37.431 --> 46:39.431
Leave her alone!

46:39.433 --> 46:40.866
That's enough.
Where's the book?

46:40.868 --> 46:42.835
Why do you want it
so badly?

46:42.837 --> 46:46.438
Ah, so Lilith can use it
to make us wealthy.

46:46.440 --> 46:47.741
Oh! Hey, Edgar.

46:49.209 --> 46:50.775
Why should we
give it to her?

46:50.777 --> 46:53.211
What if we keep the book

46:53.213 --> 46:56.681
and turn stuff into gold
for ourselves?

46:56.683 --> 46:57.819
We don't need her.

46:59.620 --> 47:01.653
That might be
the most intelligent thing

47:01.655 --> 47:02.888
I've ever heard you say.

47:02.890 --> 47:04.857
Thank you very much.

47:04.859 --> 47:06.791
We could get the book
and we could be gone

47:06.793 --> 47:08.560
before Lilith ever knows
what happened.

47:10.263 --> 47:12.263
Yeah! Hey, Edgar.

47:12.265 --> 47:13.799
What are you going
to turn into gold first?

47:13.801 --> 47:16.201
I'm gonna get
a solid gold knife

47:16.203 --> 47:18.236
with "Blade" etched
right into it.

47:18.238 --> 47:20.605
No, no, you're thinking
too small. It's too small.

47:20.607 --> 47:22.407
A solid gold car!

47:22.409 --> 47:25.911
Now you're thinking.

47:25.913 --> 47:28.580
A solid gold car?

47:28.582 --> 47:30.717
Wouldn't the weight
blow out the tires?

47:34.755 --> 47:36.388
He's got a point.

47:36.390 --> 47:39.624
No. The tires are
solid gold too.

47:39.626 --> 47:41.559
Solid gold tires!

47:45.967 --> 47:47.666
Sorry, mates.

47:47.668 --> 47:49.336
Don't have time for this.

47:52.639 --> 47:54.339
- Hi.
- Rufus!

47:54.341 --> 47:56.341
- You're alive!
- Barely. No thanks to him.

47:56.343 --> 47:57.642
I'm not sure I've ever
been eaten alive

47:57.644 --> 47:59.244
twice in one day before.

47:59.246 --> 48:01.881
First of all, the alligator
didn't swallow you.

48:01.883 --> 48:03.949
Secondly, the T-Rex
didn't have a stomach.

48:03.951 --> 48:06.351
So technically,
you have not been eaten at all today.

48:06.353 --> 48:08.653
Thanks for saving us.

48:08.655 --> 48:10.488
Rufus was going to leave
you guys behind.

48:10.490 --> 48:12.691
Wait. What?
I never said that!

48:12.693 --> 48:16.296
You totally did. Now let's get
out of here before they wake up.

48:19.533 --> 48:21.834
Oh, right!

48:21.836 --> 48:23.971
Scott, can you put that
in your backpack for me?

48:25.706 --> 48:26.740
Ew!

48:27.741 --> 48:29.008
All right!

48:29.010 --> 48:30.742
Next stop, olive tree.

48:30.744 --> 48:32.777
Hopefully it's easier than
getting the dinosaur bone.

48:32.779 --> 48:34.880
Ah. Well.
It is and it isn't.

48:34.882 --> 48:36.648
But it's in a park.

48:36.650 --> 48:37.883
That doesn't
sound so bad.

48:37.885 --> 48:39.551
Well, it's not
entirely true.

48:39.553 --> 48:42.554
Actually, it's in a
mysterious, magical forest.

48:42.556 --> 48:44.456
Plus, it will be very
dangerous, lots of predators.

48:44.458 --> 48:46.793
But! The entrance
is in a park.

48:48.062 --> 48:51.429
Open!

49:16.057 --> 49:18.258
<i>Potentious regresium!</i>

49:31.973 --> 49:34.639
Ugh! We almost had 'em!

49:34.641 --> 49:36.775
And then they got away.

49:40.480 --> 49:43.849
Oh, man!
This is nasty.

49:43.851 --> 49:45.918
What is this?

49:45.920 --> 49:49.788
It's a potion to get
my powers back.

49:49.790 --> 49:52.124
Did it work?

49:52.126 --> 49:53.593
Well, let's see.

49:58.799 --> 50:03.703
Oh, yes.
It certainly did.

50:08.542 --> 50:10.744
Much better.

50:16.150 --> 50:19.617
Oh, no! She got
her powers back.

50:19.619 --> 50:21.519
Now it's really
gonna get exciting!

50:23.124 --> 50:25.390
Okay, settle down, Peter.

50:25.392 --> 50:27.860
Yeah, I want to hear
what happens.

50:27.862 --> 50:33.665
"They needed two more items
to perform the healing spell."

51:09.603 --> 51:11.136
Hey! Pick that up!

51:11.138 --> 51:14.006
Don't just leave
your trash lying around.

51:14.008 --> 51:15.473
And why should I
listen to you?

51:15.475 --> 51:17.011
Give me that plank
with wheels.

51:19.947 --> 51:21.748
Hmm.

51:23.851 --> 51:26.551
Whoa, dude!
That's sick!

51:26.553 --> 51:28.455
That's nothing.

51:30.457 --> 51:33.160
Whoa! He's all right.

51:35.196 --> 51:37.963
You think that's amazing,
watch this.

51:41.501 --> 51:42.602
Ooh!

51:44.805 --> 51:47.505
Hey, man.
What is that?

51:47.507 --> 51:50.508
I am not a "that."
I'll have you know

51:50.510 --> 51:54.246
I am a respected member
of the kingdom of Alainn.

51:54.248 --> 51:57.515
I'm the sidekick to the head
wizard Abbott over there.

51:57.517 --> 51:59.985
See this knife?
The Queen gave this to me.

51:59.987 --> 52:01.921
For slaying an ogre.

52:01.923 --> 52:05.623
My grandfather fought
in the Battle of Five Armies.

52:07.594 --> 52:09.694
We're going
to a Renaissance Fair.

52:09.696 --> 52:11.897
Cool, man.
I love the outfits.

52:11.899 --> 52:13.999
Hey, if this is
for a costume contest,

52:14.001 --> 52:15.868
I mean, little dude
got it in the bag.

52:15.870 --> 52:17.102
Yeah, he does.
Yeah, he does.

52:17.104 --> 52:19.671
Where am I?

52:19.673 --> 52:21.073
Hey, well,
good luck.

52:21.075 --> 52:24.111
Oh! Hey!

52:25.246 --> 52:26.479
Stay safe.

52:33.720 --> 52:35.586
That was nice of you.

52:35.588 --> 52:37.856
Oh, I was having second
thoughts about that spell.

52:37.858 --> 52:39.524
Why?

52:39.526 --> 52:41.829
I could've just as easily
blown off their heads.

52:55.810 --> 52:57.209
The entrance
to the magical forest

52:57.211 --> 53:01.646
should be somewhere
around here.

53:01.648 --> 53:04.083
<i>Orducia Resermos!</i>

53:08.289 --> 53:11.158
Ah. This reminds me of home.
I'll scout ahead.

53:23.304 --> 53:26.807
Abbott, what exactly
happened to your world?

53:28.275 --> 53:29.776
Could it happen here?

53:33.314 --> 53:35.715
Yes. Yes, it can.

53:37.018 --> 53:39.852
My world used to be
a lot like yours.

53:39.854 --> 53:42.655
But my people
grew careless...

53:44.158 --> 53:46.325
greedy.

53:46.327 --> 53:48.027
And what was once
beautiful and green

53:48.029 --> 53:51.964
became dark and desolate.

53:51.966 --> 53:53.700
You're gonna
fix it, right?

53:54.701 --> 53:55.936
I'm gonna try.

53:57.670 --> 53:59.670
But you need to take care
of your world.

53:59.672 --> 54:02.241
Don't let it get so bad that
magic's the only way to fix it,

54:02.243 --> 54:05.144
because I might
not be around.

54:05.146 --> 54:08.182
It can start with you.

54:09.783 --> 54:12.119
Oh! We're close!

54:23.998 --> 54:25.332
Hey! Rufus
just found the tree.

54:26.901 --> 54:29.937
Get off the ground!
It's dirty! Hurry up.

54:34.375 --> 54:35.941
<i>They almost kissed!</i>

54:35.943 --> 54:37.409
I think I'm going
to be sick.

54:37.411 --> 54:41.113
It's not as bad
as you think, Peter.

54:41.115 --> 54:42.948
I think it's romantic.

54:42.950 --> 54:46.651
Ah, to be young
and in love.

54:46.653 --> 54:49.121
Nothing seems impossible.

54:49.123 --> 54:51.190
One day you'll find out.

54:51.192 --> 54:52.424
I don't think so.

54:52.426 --> 54:54.393
Love is a wonderful thing,

54:54.395 --> 54:56.761
and to give it to someone?

54:56.763 --> 54:59.098
There's just
nothing like it.

54:59.100 --> 55:01.601
It's like the way
that I love you two.

55:03.070 --> 55:05.404
"Emily followed her heart,

55:05.406 --> 55:10.075
and she knew deep inside
that Scott felt the same way.

55:10.077 --> 55:11.243
But for the moment,

55:11.245 --> 55:14.679
they had other things
to worry about."

55:19.786 --> 55:21.686
And here we are.

55:21.688 --> 55:25.157
That looks like a
thousand-year-old tree to me.

55:25.159 --> 55:28.460
You just need a piece of bark, right?
I can get it.

55:28.462 --> 55:31.130
It's not gonna be
that simple.

55:31.132 --> 55:34.335
What we need is sun-kissed bark
from the top of the tree.

55:36.303 --> 55:38.305
Somebody's gonna have
to climb for it.

55:40.174 --> 55:41.907
Nope. Nope. I'm out.

55:41.909 --> 55:43.842
You know
I don't do heights.

55:43.844 --> 55:45.277
Ahem.

55:45.279 --> 55:46.879
I thought
you came here to help.

55:46.881 --> 55:48.949
Help, yes.
Die, no.

55:51.218 --> 55:53.318
All right. Fine.

55:53.320 --> 55:55.220
But when I tell this
story to my children,

55:55.222 --> 55:56.889
it's going to be
more epic.

55:56.891 --> 55:58.891
Rufus,
the brave. No!

55:58.893 --> 56:01.994
Rufus, the Great Protector
of the Kingdom!

56:11.472 --> 56:13.805
I need to learn
how to say no.

56:13.807 --> 56:15.675
You can do it, Rufus!

56:41.802 --> 56:43.835
Ha ha! I got it.

56:43.837 --> 56:45.705
Yeah! Let's go, Rufus!

56:48.075 --> 56:50.509
- Whoa!
- Rufus!

56:53.480 --> 56:54.913
Do something!

56:54.915 --> 56:56.148
Fine.

56:56.150 --> 56:57.849
Wait! You might hit him!

56:57.851 --> 56:59.952
Whoa! Whoa!

57:02.489 --> 57:05.224
- Put me down!
- Put me down!

57:05.226 --> 57:06.491
Oh, come on, come on,
come on.

57:06.493 --> 57:07.993
Abbott!

57:07.995 --> 57:10.395
Help me!

57:10.397 --> 57:12.297
Ah!

57:12.299 --> 57:16.501
<i>Owl maorga, le do thoil
titim mo chara.</i>

57:18.939 --> 57:21.573
What did you say to him?

57:27.214 --> 57:28.981
Ow.

57:28.983 --> 57:31.083
Oh. But hey!

57:31.085 --> 57:33.051
I remembered
how to speak owl!

57:33.053 --> 57:35.187
Did you know
that owls

57:35.189 --> 57:38.123
don't have a word for "owl"
in their own language?

57:38.125 --> 57:41.960
I almost died, and that's
what you have to say?

57:41.962 --> 57:44.029
You should be happy.
I just saved your life.

57:44.031 --> 57:46.064
Happy is not exactly
the word I'd use.

57:46.066 --> 57:49.101
Rufus, you're my oldest
and dearest friend.

57:49.103 --> 57:50.969
You know I love you.

57:50.971 --> 57:53.405
Well, the feeling's mutual.

57:53.407 --> 57:55.440
I love you too, Rufus.

57:55.442 --> 57:58.944
And I return my love
to you, my lady.

57:58.946 --> 58:00.979
Yeah. And...

58:00.981 --> 58:04.016
I like you too, Rufus.

58:04.018 --> 58:06.118
Ahem. Okay.

58:06.120 --> 58:10.022
Really? It's not hard to tell
someone you love them, Scott.

58:10.024 --> 58:13.160
- What?
- Never mind.

58:19.199 --> 58:23.068
Ah... to be young
and clueless.

58:23.070 --> 58:25.537
Oh, and if anybody cares,
I got the...

58:25.539 --> 58:27.239
Ugh, never mind.

58:35.316 --> 58:36.984
Yes...

58:39.153 --> 58:41.055
Open!

58:49.330 --> 58:50.662
All we need is
a little volcanic stone

58:50.664 --> 58:52.130
and we're home free!

58:52.132 --> 58:55.300
Volcanic stone?
How fun.

58:55.302 --> 58:58.003
- Lilith!
- How do you plan

58:58.005 --> 59:01.106
on getting
to a volcano...

59:01.108 --> 59:04.242
so quickly?
Oh, yes.

59:04.244 --> 59:06.411
The...

59:06.413 --> 59:07.579
amulet.

59:07.581 --> 59:10.248
We need to make
a run for it.

59:10.250 --> 59:14.553
Don't underestimate me,
Abbott.

59:14.555 --> 59:16.621
You can't bind
my powers forever.

59:16.623 --> 59:18.423
- What's wrong with her?
- Seem like someone's had

59:18.425 --> 59:21.593
a little Restoration of Magical
Powers brew. Nasty stuff.

59:21.595 --> 59:26.098
Though I never understood
why it needed a dirty sock.

59:56.463 --> 59:57.898
Run!

59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.902
Get a room.

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:07.608
Open!

01:00:16.417 --> 01:00:18.116
This is incredible.

01:00:18.118 --> 01:00:20.385
Where are we?

01:00:20.387 --> 01:00:24.222
We are at the edge
of the world.

01:00:24.224 --> 01:00:26.291
Too close. if you ask me.

01:00:34.735 --> 01:00:36.735
<i>"No one said a word,</i>

01:00:36.737 --> 01:00:39.704
<i>as they stood
in amazement and wonder.</i>

01:00:39.706 --> 01:00:45.143
They were at the edge of one of
the most desolate places on earth.

01:00:45.145 --> 01:00:50.048
All they had to do was collect
a volcanic rock, and with it,

01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:53.118
they would be one step
closer to healing Alainn."

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.786
Well, that doesn't
sound too hard.

01:00:54.788 --> 01:00:58.623
Harder than you think,
but they have each other.

01:00:58.625 --> 01:01:00.325
Rufus is my favorite.

01:01:00.327 --> 01:01:02.761
He's strong and loyal
and courageous.

01:01:02.763 --> 01:01:05.497
I don't think the others
have done too badly.

01:01:05.499 --> 01:01:08.033
Emily figured out
how to use the amulet.

01:01:08.035 --> 01:01:10.502
Abbott has saved everyone
many times,

01:01:10.504 --> 01:01:12.103
especially Rufus.

01:01:12.105 --> 01:01:15.307
- Mm.
- What about Scott?

01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:19.277
He saved Emily from that
dinosaur skeleton thing.

01:01:19.279 --> 01:01:21.279
Don't care.
Rufus is the best.

01:01:21.281 --> 01:01:24.249
In the end, it's going to take
all of them working together

01:01:24.251 --> 01:01:26.451
to save Rufus' world.

01:01:29.056 --> 01:01:30.422
What are you doing?

01:01:30.424 --> 01:01:32.157
We're running
out of time.

01:01:32.159 --> 01:01:34.759
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. "We?"

01:01:34.761 --> 01:01:36.628
We're simple thieves.

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:39.297
Plus, you said you were
gonna make us rich.

01:01:39.299 --> 01:01:41.666
Yeah, we're tired
of getting zapped.

01:01:41.668 --> 01:01:43.803
So, why don't you let us know
how it works for you?

01:01:43.805 --> 01:01:47.105
'Cause we're done.

01:01:47.107 --> 01:01:49.407
Oh, you're done
all right.

01:01:49.409 --> 01:01:51.745
Oh, Edgar.
Blade, dear.

01:01:53.514 --> 01:01:56.314
See? She knows
it's Blade.

01:01:56.316 --> 01:01:58.851
Whose side are you on?

01:01:58.853 --> 01:02:00.587
<i>Rodentia transformulus.</i>

01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:33.118
That was too easy.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.519
Hey. We got it.

01:02:34.521 --> 01:02:35.888
Oh.

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:38.492
Perfect.
Let's go home.

01:02:41.161 --> 01:02:42.360
Lilith.

01:02:42.362 --> 01:02:44.729
You've nowhere
to run, Abbott.

01:02:44.731 --> 01:02:48.166
Give me what I want
and I'll let you live.

01:02:48.168 --> 01:02:50.337
The other half of the book,
if you please.

01:02:51.605 --> 01:02:53.204
Give it to me

01:02:53.206 --> 01:02:55.440
or I'll just take it
from your dead hands.

01:02:55.442 --> 01:02:57.142
You know what?

01:02:57.144 --> 01:02:58.476
I would love
to see you try.

01:02:58.478 --> 01:03:01.313
Really?

01:03:01.315 --> 01:03:03.615
You're bringing a knife
to a wizard battle?

01:03:03.617 --> 01:03:04.884
She's got a point.

01:03:04.886 --> 01:03:06.553
We're rooting
for you, buddy!

01:03:21.535 --> 01:03:23.368
You are not the wizard
you once were, Abbott.

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:25.604
I think I'm doing
pretty good.

01:03:25.606 --> 01:03:27.305
Try spending two years in the
forest, in your underwear,

01:03:27.307 --> 01:03:30.342
eating squirrels
and see how <i>you</i> fare.

01:03:30.344 --> 01:03:32.577
- No offense.
- None taken.

01:03:32.579 --> 01:03:35.815
Let's see how well you hold up
against your own magic!

01:03:39.753 --> 01:03:43.455
Born from the deep
and liquid fire,

01:03:43.457 --> 01:03:47.459
I command the dark
and terrible...

01:03:47.461 --> 01:03:50.130
dragon fire!

01:03:55.369 --> 01:03:57.837
Did... did you just rhyme
fire with fire?

01:03:57.839 --> 01:04:00.340
You wrote it.

01:04:02.476 --> 01:04:04.812
She's...
she's right. I did.

01:04:14.588 --> 01:04:18.523
Ho! That is a lot scarier
in person!

01:04:18.525 --> 01:04:21.493
Why do you have a spell
for an evil dragon?

01:04:21.495 --> 01:04:22.962
It seemed like
a good idea at the time!

01:04:22.964 --> 01:04:24.396
And what time was that?

01:04:24.398 --> 01:04:26.932
I was going
through a phase!

01:04:34.842 --> 01:04:38.243
My, aren't you scary.

01:04:40.747 --> 01:04:42.917
Burn them!

01:05:03.871 --> 01:05:05.405
Hide!

01:05:54.721 --> 01:05:56.858
No... No....

01:06:10.537 --> 01:06:13.072
No! The amulet!

01:06:13.074 --> 01:06:15.473
Looks like we're all
stuck in this realm now.

01:06:15.475 --> 01:06:16.811
Nighty-night.

01:07:19.907 --> 01:07:21.675
Whoa! Oh!

01:07:24.846 --> 01:07:27.681
Whoa!

01:08:13.895 --> 01:08:16.127
Open!

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:19.033
Run.

01:08:41.188 --> 01:08:43.858
I can finally
get out of this dump.

01:09:11.953 --> 01:09:13.821
I remember who I am.

01:09:17.959 --> 01:09:19.091
I remember everything.

01:09:20.995 --> 01:09:22.760
I'm Abbott,

01:09:22.761 --> 01:09:24.761
the Great Wizard of Alainn,

01:09:24.764 --> 01:09:26.631
Keeper of the Book of Spells,

01:09:26.633 --> 01:09:29.201
Traveler Between Worlds!

01:09:29.203 --> 01:09:33.037
And about to be
Slayer of Dragons!

01:10:08.275 --> 01:10:09.975
Oh!

01:10:09.977 --> 01:10:11.310
You've wasted
enough of my time.

01:10:11.312 --> 01:10:13.212
Give it to me! Now!

01:10:13.214 --> 01:10:15.680
You are so fired when my
grandma hears about this!

01:10:15.682 --> 01:10:18.119
She can't fire me,
'cause I quit!

01:10:28.996 --> 01:10:30.131
Rufus!

01:10:31.132 --> 01:10:33.165
Lilith!

01:10:50.251 --> 01:10:52.851
What? I don't want
to hear anymore.

01:10:52.853 --> 01:10:54.685
Don't you want to hear
how it ends?

01:10:54.687 --> 01:10:56.788
Nope. I'm done.

01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:58.790
Yeah, this story's terrible.

01:10:58.792 --> 01:11:01.226
The story isn't done yet.

01:11:01.228 --> 01:11:03.862
A lot can happen
in a few pages.

01:11:03.864 --> 01:11:06.300
I guess, but Rufus
can't be dead.

01:11:19.712 --> 01:11:20.813
Open!

01:11:20.815 --> 01:11:22.381
Fool!

01:11:22.383 --> 01:11:23.951
You can't destroy me!

01:11:26.753 --> 01:11:29.323
This is for Rufus.

01:11:34.395 --> 01:11:36.261
No! No!

01:11:52.413 --> 01:11:53.979
Rufus.

01:11:53.981 --> 01:11:55.983
Rufus...

01:12:02.256 --> 01:12:03.390
Don't be sad.

01:12:08.295 --> 01:12:12.665
The magic dust doesn't <i>only</i> have
the power to heal our world.

01:12:15.136 --> 01:12:18.806
But I <i>will</i> need the elements
from your backpack, Scott.

01:12:20.307 --> 01:12:21.942
And my spell book,
if you don't mind.

01:13:26.307 --> 01:13:29.508
Blood of the beast
and ancient bone,

01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:32.978
olive bark
and volcanic stone.

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:35.914
From the past
and living old,

01:13:35.916 --> 01:13:39.851
grant the power,
new life take hold!

01:14:03.077 --> 01:14:07.045
It only takes a few grains.

01:14:12.319 --> 01:14:14.253
It's not working.

01:14:14.255 --> 01:14:16.457
Give it a second.

01:14:23.163 --> 01:14:26.200
Rufus!

01:14:28.936 --> 01:14:31.372
What did I miss?

01:14:32.906 --> 01:14:34.139
Did we win?

01:14:34.141 --> 01:14:36.942
We did. We won.

01:14:36.944 --> 01:14:38.545
Scott, help me out
with this.

01:14:47.288 --> 01:14:48.989
Thank you.

01:14:51.292 --> 01:14:53.292
Now. We need to go.

01:14:53.294 --> 01:14:55.127
Thank you both.

01:14:55.129 --> 01:14:57.462
We could have never completed
our quest without you.

01:14:57.464 --> 01:15:00.232
And our kingdom is forever
in your debt,

01:15:00.234 --> 01:15:01.867
as are we.

01:15:01.869 --> 01:15:03.502
Will we ever
see you again?

01:15:03.504 --> 01:15:05.304
Some day.

01:15:05.306 --> 01:15:07.339
You never know what our
futures may have in store.

01:15:07.341 --> 01:15:08.809
Take care
of each other.

01:15:09.643 --> 01:15:11.443
We will.

01:15:11.445 --> 01:15:13.914
And try to do a better job
of taking care of your world.

01:15:16.483 --> 01:15:18.383
Hey, Rufus.

01:15:18.385 --> 01:15:20.319
I know I'm hard on you.

01:15:20.321 --> 01:15:23.324
And, honestly,
I'm hard to deal with.

01:15:24.958 --> 01:15:27.526
But you're the only
true friend I've ever had.

01:15:27.528 --> 01:15:30.996
And I care
a great deal for you.

01:15:30.998 --> 01:15:33.598
Now, come on,
Great Protector of the Kingdom.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.369
And don't you forget it.

01:15:37.171 --> 01:15:39.440
Open!

01:15:56.323 --> 01:15:59.024
Ho! Really? You two?

01:15:59.026 --> 01:16:00.258
I would've never
saw that coming.

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:01.560
I just came back
for my spell book.

01:16:01.562 --> 01:16:03.897
Rufus! Did you know
this was going on?

01:16:14.575 --> 01:16:17.943
Have you two seen Lilith
or Edgar or Norman?

01:16:17.945 --> 01:16:19.711
No.

01:16:19.713 --> 01:16:23.348
I set this whole table
by myself.

01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:25.484
So, how was your day?

01:16:25.486 --> 01:16:27.185
Did you learn anything
at the library?

01:16:27.187 --> 01:16:29.488
Yes, lots.
We only have one planet

01:16:29.490 --> 01:16:31.223
and we have
to take care of it.

01:16:31.225 --> 01:16:35.193
His grandfather always said
knowledge opens doors.

01:16:35.195 --> 01:16:37.963
We went into
the locked room upstairs.

01:16:37.965 --> 01:16:40.432
I told you not to go
into that room, Scott.

01:16:40.434 --> 01:16:43.101
I'm sorry,
but Rufus and Abbott

01:16:43.103 --> 01:16:45.003
needed our help
to save their world.

01:16:45.005 --> 01:16:47.472
Rufus and Abbott?

01:16:47.474 --> 01:16:50.409
They came from another world through
the magical doorway in the attic.

01:16:50.411 --> 01:16:53.245
We helped them make a magic dust
to keep their world from dying.

01:16:53.247 --> 01:16:56.715
Stop it. I don't want
to hear any more about Rufus.

01:16:56.717 --> 01:17:00.051
Your grandfather would
tell me stories about him.

01:17:00.053 --> 01:17:02.554
I don't know
how you found out about it.

01:17:02.556 --> 01:17:05.023
The last year,
with your grandfather's illness,

01:17:05.025 --> 01:17:07.225
was very difficult.

01:17:07.227 --> 01:17:09.327
I don't think
he knew the difference

01:17:09.329 --> 01:17:13.698
between reality
and make-believe sometimes.

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:16.001
- Grandma...
- This isn't funny.

01:17:16.003 --> 01:17:17.571
We're telling the truth.

01:17:19.373 --> 01:17:22.276
Look! It's real!

01:17:42.162 --> 01:17:44.097
It's real, Scott?

01:17:45.766 --> 01:17:48.035
It's all real?

01:17:50.304 --> 01:17:52.471
There's magic
in this world too.

01:17:52.473 --> 01:17:53.574
What magic?

01:17:54.575 --> 01:17:56.775
Love.

01:17:56.777 --> 01:17:59.446
It's the way Scott is
looking at you right now.

01:18:00.747 --> 01:18:02.447
His grandfather
looked at me that way

01:18:02.449 --> 01:18:05.484
every day of his life.

01:18:05.486 --> 01:18:08.153
I still remember
the first time.

01:18:08.155 --> 01:18:12.491
That's when I knew
how much he loved me

01:18:12.493 --> 01:18:14.661
and how much I loved him.

01:18:16.563 --> 01:18:19.698
Cherish every day.

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.366
Having you two here

01:18:21.368 --> 01:18:26.373
reminds me of what it's like
to be alive and loved.

01:18:28.075 --> 01:18:30.275
Love.

01:18:30.277 --> 01:18:33.345
It's the most powerful magic
I've ever seen.

01:18:37.618 --> 01:18:39.684
So... Emily.

01:18:39.686 --> 01:18:41.121
You got a date
for the dance?

01:18:42.723 --> 01:18:45.825
- Rufus?
- You're going to the dance with Rufus?

01:18:45.827 --> 01:18:48.226
Scott! Emily!

01:18:48.228 --> 01:18:51.129
Did you forget something?
Is the magic dust working?

01:18:51.131 --> 01:18:52.597
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That was a month ago now.

01:18:52.599 --> 01:18:54.401
The kingdom needs
your help once more.

01:18:58.472 --> 01:18:59.807
What do we need to do?

01:19:05.847 --> 01:19:08.649
- They did it!
- I would love to see real magic.

01:19:11.118 --> 01:19:13.785
Time for bed.
It's getting late.

01:19:13.787 --> 01:19:15.754
Oh, come on,
grandpa!

01:19:15.756 --> 01:19:18.390
What about Rufus?
He needs their help.

01:19:18.392 --> 01:19:20.828
And that's a story for another night.
Come on.

01:19:22.362 --> 01:19:25.697
- You promise?
- Yes, I promise.

01:19:25.699 --> 01:19:28.266
- Good night.
- Good night, grandpa.

01:19:28.268 --> 01:19:29.770
Good night.
