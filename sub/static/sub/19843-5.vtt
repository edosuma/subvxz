00:58.180 --> 01:00.091
I wanna tell you about this great
new product.

01:00.350 --> 01:01.840
It will only take a minute of your time.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.977
I guarantee you've never seen anything
like this.

01:06.060 --> 01:07.550
At an estimated triple profit...

01:07.730 --> 01:09.436
Hitting the market in two weeks...

01:09.730 --> 01:15.145
With a revolutionary, synthesised opiate
offering security and versatility.

01:15.740 --> 01:17.981
Pills, patch, powder, drops.

01:18.570 --> 01:20.197
It's 100% pure...

01:20.490 --> 01:22.117
100% of the time.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.908
Boasting a faster absorption rate,
a slower metabolic rate...

01:26.540 --> 01:28.371
and the most exciting part,

01:28.750 --> 01:31.207
the CP450 liver enzyme inhibitor.

01:31.380 --> 01:34.463
Which prevents the human body from ever
building a tolerance to it.

01:34.880 --> 01:35.926
So, as you can see...

01:36.340 --> 01:39.639
The value of this particular heroin
is unprecedented.

01:40.050 --> 01:42.803
Why not let an expert be the judge?

01:55.740 --> 01:59.562
Oh, honey, you don't need to worry
about that mess anymore.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.116
This is ridiculous.

02:36.820 --> 02:37.980
What the hell is this?

02:41.030 --> 02:41.940
If you broke him...

02:42.120 --> 02:44.611
My mum always told me
patience is a virtue.

02:58.340 --> 03:00.046
It's like the first time.

03:03.140 --> 03:04.129
Oh, my God!

03:05.390 --> 03:06.880
How much can I order?

04:30.930 --> 04:32.477
And it isn't opium based?

04:33.100 --> 04:36.479
Every test I ran on that sample
proves it's chemical.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.721
No need to harvest opium
from foreign countries.

04:40.780 --> 04:44.602
In fact, the most amazing aspect
of this drug

04:44.910 --> 04:46.616
is that there's nothing illegal about it.

04:46.780 --> 04:47.735
Mm.

04:47.990 --> 04:51.369
So with the right supplies,
any amount can be made in a real lab.

04:51.830 --> 04:53.786
Whoever the Einstein is behind this

04:53.960 --> 04:56.827
made sure there'd be no limit to how much
one can make.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.206
Hmm.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.457
A drug like this could mean a major
epidemic in this city.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.170
I'm gonna deal with this.

05:06.510 --> 05:08.592
- Wow. How are you...
- Hey.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.176
Thank you so much for your help, Sandi.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.185
Thank you.

05:32.750 --> 05:36.072
Inside, you'll find all the reports
from federal, state, and local agencies.

05:36.370 --> 05:39.828
Our chemical plant on Staten Island
has passed every onsite inspection.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.582
I have 15 documented cancer diagnoses
that say you're wrong.

05:45.090 --> 05:47.547
I acknowledge how terribly unfortunate
this is,

05:47.760 --> 05:50.137
but Rand Enterprises had nothing
to do with it.

05:50.550 --> 05:51.801
So it's just a coincidence that

05:51.970 --> 05:54.473
all the victims live within_ a one-mile
radius of your faCIIIty?

05:54.640 --> 05:56.801
We have been compliant
with every applicable

05:56.980 --> 05:59.016
environmental law and regulation.

05:59.690 --> 06:01.851
I'm afraid you're looking for something
that simply isn't there.

06:02.020 --> 06:03.726
We'll be hiring our own team
to do the looking.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.487
That's your prerogative.
We have nothing to hide.

06:07.910 --> 06:10.196
But if you do manage to establish

06:10.370 --> 06:12.691
a connection to the emissions
from that plant...

06:13.160 --> 06:15.151
our company still followed the law.

06:15.540 --> 06:16.996
Then the laws are wrong.

06:17.870 --> 06:19.701
If that's true,
your fight doesn't belong here.

06:20.670 --> 06:23.878
Rand Enterprises cannot be held
responsible for governmental guidelines.

06:35.140 --> 06:36.300
I think we're done.

06:51.780 --> 06:54.237
It's being shipped in
through the new Rand pier, Ward.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.207
Is that heroin?
You bring drugs in my office?

07:07.380 --> 07:09.086
Look, I had to find out
what we're dealing with.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.546
What makes you think
this has anything to do with us?

07:11.720 --> 07:14.507
Hai-Qing Yang.
He's head of the Yang Clan Company.

07:15.970 --> 07:16.959
What are you talking about?

07:17.140 --> 07:19.882
The Yang Clan Company. It's a front.

07:20.060 --> 07:21.516
For what? The Hatchet Men.

07:21.690 --> 07:23.476
It's a criminal syndicate.

07:26.650 --> 07:29.733
Hai-Qing Yang used to have a deal
at our pier.

07:30.110 --> 07:31.850
When we bought it, we shut them out.

07:32.070 --> 07:35.949
Now, they got pretty angry,
but don't worry, I cleared it up.

07:36.410 --> 07:38.037
- Hatchet Men?
- Yes.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.201
I asked Hai-Qing what the Hand
wanted with the pier,

07:41.370 --> 07:43.122
and then they sent me a box.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.161
This was inside.

07:46.130 --> 07:47.199
It's a message.

07:47.710 --> 07:49.837
Do you know how crazy this sounds?

07:50.050 --> 07:51.119
It's not.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.217
Look at the symbol on the bag.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.175
A snake? It's not a snake.

07:59.350 --> 08:01.932
It's the symbol for Shou-Lao the Undying.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.010
The Undying?

08:04.310 --> 08:05.470
From K'un-Lun.

08:06.150 --> 08:08.311
Shou-Lao made me a living weapon.

08:08.690 --> 08:11.397
Okay, now you've lost me.

08:11.650 --> 08:13.606
- The dragon.
- Ah.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.487
Look, don't you see?

08:15.910 --> 08:17.070
It's all connected.

08:18.870 --> 08:20.906
Okay.

08:21.870 --> 08:22.859
Let me make this simple.

08:23.920 --> 08:28.038
The Hand is using our company to smuggle
synthetic heroin into the city.

08:28.710 --> 08:30.337
We need to stop it.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.837
Harold said so himself. You were there.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.176
And you've figured all of this out

08:37.350 --> 08:41.229
because some Chinese dude left a box at
your door?

08:42.310 --> 08:44.847
- Yes.
- No.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.431
- But Harold...
- That's between the two of you.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.233
I have real business
in the real world to deal with.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.241
Fine.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.780
I'll leave you to it then.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.410
Thanks.

09:09.880 --> 09:10.790
Hey!

09:22.430 --> 09:24.728
- Megan?
- Yes, Mr Rand?

09:25.140 --> 09:26.846
You're an assistant, right?

09:27.770 --> 09:30.352
Does that kind of mean
you're like my apprentice?

09:30.520 --> 09:32.317
No, I'm here to help with scheduling,

09:32.480 --> 09:34.277
phone calls, day-to-day stuff
around the office.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.273
Oh, like this morning when I wanted
to speak to one of our Rand scientists.

09:37.450 --> 09:39.236
- Exactly.
- Right.

09:39.580 --> 09:44.529
So, um, if I wanted you to go out and buy
me, say, a box of Fruit Roll-Ups...

09:45.330 --> 09:46.570
You'd have to do it.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.239
I could make that happen.

09:48.420 --> 09:49.705
- Do you want some Fruit Roll-Ups?
- No.

09:51.170 --> 09:54.412
But I, uh... I do need to know when the
next shipment arrives

09:54.590 --> 09:55.579
at the Red Hook Pier.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.000
- Could you tell me that?
- No.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.538
Mm.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.961
But if you like, I can call Sarah Galvin
in Transport

10:02.140 --> 10:03.676
and have her bring that information
up to you.

10:03.850 --> 10:05.090
I'm on my way down now, anyway.

10:05.270 --> 10:06.510
She's right off the elevator
on the fourth floor.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.510
I'll let her know you're coming.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.510
I'm so glad we had this talk.

10:20.450 --> 10:22.771
- Going to lunch.
- Yes, Mr Meachum.

10:22.950 --> 10:24.110
Me too.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.240
How'd the meeting go?

10:27.410 --> 10:29.628
Exactly what you said.
They don't have a case.

10:30.580 --> 10:32.628
You don't seem especially happy about it.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.041
Just questioning things, I guess.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.790
What kind of things?

10:41.300 --> 10:43.348
Are we on the right side of this?

10:47.770 --> 10:48.839
I don't know.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.939
Did you know that some gang called
the Yang Clan had a deal with Patel

10:55.110 --> 10:57.271
before we made that pier acquisition?

10:59.030 --> 11:01.157
Someone was using it. Who cares?

11:11.540 --> 11:13.167
Have you been talking to Danny?

11:14.130 --> 11:15.119
No.

11:16.670 --> 11:19.753
Then what are you trying to say?

11:20.800 --> 11:23.542
You wanna know the truth
about that meeting?

11:25.640 --> 11:27.016
It was brutal.

11:28.350 --> 11:29.931
Just looking at those people
in their faces,

11:30.100 --> 11:32.307
knowing exactly
what they were suffering from.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.390
That's because you're a good person.

11:42.740 --> 11:45.573
Because you're also a good
businesswoman...

11:46.540 --> 11:48.940
and that means you have to make
hard decisions.

11:50.290 --> 11:52.531
You have to find a balance...

11:53.500 --> 11:56.992
and you do that better than most of us.

12:00.130 --> 12:03.258
Why can't I stop asking myself
if we're doing something wrong?

12:03.640 --> 12:05.255
Regarding the plant?

12:05.430 --> 12:06.499
You know we're not.

12:06.680 --> 12:09.137
As it stands now, no.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.381
But what if they discover something new
in the future?

12:12.940 --> 12:14.146
There are laws that don't exist yet.

12:15.650 --> 12:19.142
No one can live their lives
like that, Joy.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.606
I know. I know, I just...

12:23.450 --> 12:24.986
I wish it was my fault.

12:25.990 --> 12:29.778
Sounds ludicrous... but at least then
there'd be something I could do about it.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.030
Help them.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.611
You know what this is really about, right?

12:35.710 --> 12:37.530
I was so scared when Dad got sick.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.206
These people are just grasping
for the same answers I did.

12:41.380 --> 12:42.586
We can't blame them.

12:44.050 --> 12:47.258
Everyone wants the ability to prevent
bad things from happening...

12:48.470 --> 12:51.428
but, unfortunately,
sometimes it's just a matter of chance.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.933
That's the last thing
a control freak wants to hear.

13:11.870 --> 13:13.076
I'm gonna go talk to him.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.329
Mr Rand?

13:22.380 --> 13:23.870
Sorry, do I know you?

13:24.050 --> 13:28.043
I read about that drug thing you did in
the paper.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.007
You have the power to change things
at this company.

13:31.970 --> 13:34.848
That's why I... I wanted to show you this.

13:35.770 --> 13:36.930
My son.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.760
That's his fourth-grade photo.

13:39.480 --> 13:40.890
Class picture day.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.896
He has cancer.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.362
I don't understand.

13:48.660 --> 13:52.118
He got it from the Rand chemical plant
near where we live.

13:52.450 --> 13:56.705
It's spewing poison into the air,
the ground, all around us.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.541
I didn't know. I...

14:02.710 --> 14:04.291
You're different than the others.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.659
Compassionate.

14:06.590 --> 14:07.966
Please, will you help us?

14:10.970 --> 14:12.506
I am so sorry.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.089
We'll make this right.

14:27.530 --> 14:28.485
Okay, switch left.

14:35.000 --> 14:35.989
Okay, push kicks.

14:37.330 --> 14:38.456
Let's try that again.

14:38.540 --> 14:39.450
Use your hips more.

14:39.580 --> 14:40.740
Better.

14:42.540 --> 14:43.916
Oh, what was that? Come on, hit me.

14:44.090 --> 14:45.626
Okay. Okay. Okay.

14:50.050 --> 14:52.098
You are not to be underestimated, Claire.

14:53.050 --> 14:55.518
Hell, I'm still getting used to bringing
the hurt...

14:56.020 --> 14:57.635
instead of fixing it.

14:57.930 --> 15:00.091
Well, for what it's worth...

15:00.560 --> 15:02.767
I've never had a student
progress as fast as you have.

15:05.480 --> 15:09.769
Guess I got tired of people doing things
for me all the time.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.770
Tell me about it.

15:13.030 --> 15:14.827
In that case, we better keep practicing.

15:14.990 --> 15:16.116
Okay.

15:26.590 --> 15:27.625
Hey.

15:29.010 --> 15:29.999
Hey.

15:31.890 --> 15:32.879
Hi.

15:34.260 --> 15:36.308
You're Danny Rand, right?

15:36.470 --> 15:38.017
I've seen you on the news.

15:39.390 --> 15:41.688
_ Talk about
a riches-to-rags-to-rlches story.

15:41.980 --> 15:43.516
Yeah, it's been, uh...
It's been pretty crazy.

15:45.070 --> 15:48.312
Yeah, well, you live in this city long
enough, nothing surprises you anymore.

15:52.950 --> 15:54.861
Um... One sec.

15:56.830 --> 15:59.242
Hi, Danny.

16:00.290 --> 16:01.200
Need something?

16:01.370 --> 16:04.578
I, uh, just wanted to have a talk
with you.

16:05.000 --> 16:05.910
Uh-huh.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.502
Well, um,
it'll have to wait till I'm done.

16:09.170 --> 16:11.832
Oh, but I ordered takeout.

16:12.760 --> 16:13.636
You what?

16:15.850 --> 16:19.388
Sorry.
I'm in the middle of a lesson.

16:19.560 --> 16:20.970
- Claire Temple.
- Hey.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.515
How do you two know each other?

16:25.860 --> 16:26.815
Oh, well, um... she...

16:26.900 --> 16:28.219
We... We don't really...

16:28.400 --> 16:31.392
She gave me a couple of bucks when I lived
in the park.

16:32.110 --> 16:33.441
I see.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.405
Oh, what the...

16:37.240 --> 16:39.731
Excuse me, hi.
What the hell is going on?

16:42.250 --> 16:43.820
I told you, I ordered takeout.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.569
No, no, no, no, no.

16:46.750 --> 16:51.335
You cannot just show up here with all
of this stuff expecting some...

16:51.550 --> 16:55.259
- Is this a date?
- What? No. Of course not.

16:56.430 --> 16:58.671
I mean, uh, unless you want it to be.

16:58.850 --> 16:59.919
- No.
- Okay.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.010
Good.

17:01.180 --> 17:02.920
It's definitely not that.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.892
- Oh, wow.
- I just...

17:07.060 --> 17:08.049
I need your help.

17:08.860 --> 17:10.316
And that requires candlelight?

17:11.480 --> 17:14.449
This was my dad's favorite place.
It's the only takeout I know.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.485
Smells good.

17:19.780 --> 17:21.111
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.952
You know, I'd be thrilled to spend the
rest of my session

17:27.130 --> 17:28.836
just joining the two of you.

17:32.590 --> 17:34.376
I've never had takeout like this before.

17:34.550 --> 17:36.757
- Oh, the thing is, it's...
- It's a great idea.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.597
It's a really, really good idea.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.557
You ’re a’h‘ferent than the others.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.589
Compassionate.

17:44.770 --> 17:47.762
P/ease, W/7/ you help us?

17:47.980 --> 17:49.550
I am so sony.

17:50.150 --> 17:51.139
We 7/ make this n'ght.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.776
What an idiot!

17:54.070 --> 17:55.640
Does he have any idea what he just did?

17:55.820 --> 17:58.732
I'm sure he has no idea that he was
speaking for the entire company.

17:58.910 --> 18:00.366
What do you wanna do about it?

18:00.580 --> 18:01.569
Well...

18:02.540 --> 18:05.998
We weren't gonna settle before,
and we're not gonna settle now.

18:06.790 --> 18:09.532
Especially when they're asking double
the original number.

18:09.710 --> 18:10.665
That's blackmail.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.547
They didn't have a leg to stand on before.
Now they do.

18:14.170 --> 18:16.502
The principal shareholder
of Rand Enterprises

18:16.670 --> 18:18.422
has accepted responsibility.

18:19.550 --> 18:20.756
Right.

18:23.600 --> 18:28.970
"The... board member was coerced into...

18:29.190 --> 18:31.647
an admission of fault
under false pretenses.

18:32.230 --> 18:35.529
No legal connection has been drawn
between...

18:42.080 --> 18:43.820
We'll win this in court.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.618
A case like this could take years.

18:47.790 --> 18:49.417
Still cheaper than settling.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.286
Ward, they're threatening to release
this video by the end of the day.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.621
So? Doesn't buy them anything.

18:55.210 --> 18:57.041
Just because you have a guilt complex
going on with all this.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.335
Oh, don't throw this back at me!

18:58.510 --> 19:00.967
I always act in the company's
best interest.

19:01.550 --> 19:03.347
I just wanna make sure your emotions

19:03.510 --> 19:06.263
aren't clouding the fact
that this was clearly a setup.

19:06.430 --> 19:07.385
Who cares what it was?

19:07.560 --> 19:09.721
I'm saying we have to consider
what it looks like.

19:13.980 --> 19:15.641
Let me think about it, okay?

19:19.280 --> 19:20.656
I'll have Megan gather the board.

19:20.820 --> 19:23.311
Make sure the idiot is in attendance.

19:23.870 --> 19:26.156
Throwing Danny to the wolves will only
make this worse.

19:26.330 --> 19:27.615
You know, before all this shit went down,

19:27.790 --> 19:30.953
he's in my office,
running his mouth about a dragon?

19:34.880 --> 19:37.371
He's in a completely different world, Joy.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.041
He lives in ours now.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.250
Thank you.

21:08.890 --> 21:11.381
To the precious Buddha,
the unsurpassable teacher.

21:12.180 --> 21:14.842
To the precious dharma,
the unsurpassable protection.

21:15.650 --> 21:18.722
To the precious sangha,
the unsurpassable guides.

21:19.360 --> 21:23.182
To you three rare
and supreme sources of refuge, I offer.

21:42.050 --> 21:44.541
So, when you were at that monastery,

21:44.840 --> 21:49.254
could you get a burger,
or was it all just vegetarian crap?

21:50.890 --> 21:53.176
We only ate vegetables we grew
in the monastery.

21:53.470 --> 21:55.938
But sometimes I'd sneak out
with my friend Davos.

21:56.390 --> 21:57.891
We'd, uh, go eat some donkey.

21:59.520 --> 22:00.509
Donkey?

22:03.360 --> 22:04.930
Donkey's actually pretty good.

22:05.900 --> 22:08.812
My grandmother could stir fry the shit out
of donkey and veggies.

22:09.530 --> 22:10.986
I'll take your word for it.

22:14.450 --> 22:15.997
Mm.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.496
When you weren't sneaking out...

22:19.540 --> 22:21.201
were you just waiting around...

22:21.790 --> 22:23.337
what, meditating?

22:25.260 --> 22:26.409
Not exactly.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.216
We learned martial arts.

22:31.220 --> 22:32.676
That must have been tough.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.049
What with you being so young.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.426
Mm.

22:35.810 --> 22:37.186
It was what it was.

22:38.520 --> 22:39.760
Well, still...

22:40.060 --> 22:42.563
After everything you'd been through
with the crash.

22:44.280 --> 22:47.818
I don't know, that would have been a
really hard thing for me to have handled.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.229
Mm.

22:50.570 --> 22:51.810
I, um...

22:52.740 --> 22:53.729
I focused on my training.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.826
Anything that distracted me from that,
I renounced.

23:00.790 --> 23:02.667
Material attachments, uh...

23:03.880 --> 23:06.587
indulgent activities,
romantic entanglements.

23:08.050 --> 23:10.507
Wait, you... you took a vow of chastity?

23:12.640 --> 23:15.461
Yeah. Of course.

23:22.360 --> 23:25.181
Why did you wait this long?

23:25.480 --> 23:26.811
To come back, I mean.

23:27.650 --> 23:31.234
The way was closed.
I had to wait for it to open again.

23:35.410 --> 23:37.401
So, you said you wanted to talk about
something?

23:38.040 --> 23:38.950
Oh.

23:39.120 --> 23:40.610
Yeah, I, um...

23:41.370 --> 23:42.325
Ijust, uh...

23:42.500 --> 23:44.912
I don't really know where to start.

23:47.550 --> 23:50.929
I would love to stick around
and hear more,

23:51.090 --> 23:52.751
but I've gotta get going.

23:53.720 --> 23:54.789
You don't have to go.

23:57.470 --> 24:00.223
Yeah. Um. Do you mind?

24:00.560 --> 24:02.596
No, take whatever you want.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.439
Cool?

24:15.830 --> 24:16.819
Namaste.

24:17.910 --> 24:19.946
See ya.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.666
What's going on?

24:24.170 --> 24:25.159
Are you okay?

24:29.420 --> 24:30.580
It's Rand.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.711
Some bad people have gotten on the inside.

24:35.930 --> 24:36.919
Criminals.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.928
They're using the company as a cover
to conduct their own business.

24:42.810 --> 24:44.266
What kind of business?

24:45.520 --> 24:47.476
They're trying to get a synthetic heroin
into the city.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.475
Heroin?

24:50.780 --> 24:52.486
Okay, you need to go to the police.

24:52.650 --> 24:55.107
No. That would just make it worse.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.445
Rand would be held responsible,

24:57.620 --> 24:59.485
and they'll just find another way to get
their drugs in.

24:59.660 --> 25:01.400
So what are you gonna do?

25:01.910 --> 25:03.616
Well, look...

25:04.000 --> 25:05.627
Ward doesn't believe me.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.537
But ifI can prove to him it's really
happening...

25:09.710 --> 25:11.120
He'll have to help me shut it down.

25:12.130 --> 25:13.461
To prove it, you need evidence.

25:13.630 --> 25:14.710
Mm.

25:16.140 --> 25:19.462
There's a shipment tonight at 8:30
at the Rand pier.

25:20.390 --> 25:21.550
There's an inspection process

25:21.770 --> 25:24.887
before the containers get loaded
onto the trucks and sent out for delivery.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.510
They open each one up... and boom!

25:28.440 --> 25:30.897
Stacks and stacks of synthetic heroin.

25:31.070 --> 25:32.640
Wouldn't they hide it?

25:32.820 --> 25:34.276
They don't have to.

25:34.740 --> 25:36.196
They own the pier.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.070
I just need you to watch my back.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.115
You're joking.

25:47.290 --> 25:48.700
You want me to come with you?

25:50.090 --> 25:51.079
Yes.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.541
I'm just a karate teacher, Danny.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.460
No, you're not. You're a fighter.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.790
Look, I know you've been testing yourself
at an underground fight club.

25:59.970 --> 26:01.050
- What._..
- I get It!

26:01.220 --> 26:03.131
You... You're unsatisfied,
you're restless.

26:03.390 --> 26:04.721
I know those feelings.

26:04.980 --> 26:07.130
Years and years training in K'un-Lun
wasted,

26:07.310 --> 26:08.641
waiting on a threat that never arrived.

26:08.810 --> 26:10.687
- This is crazy.
- It's not crazy.

26:11.190 --> 26:12.646
People die from this.

26:13.280 --> 26:16.397
If this synthetic heroin gets on
the streets, it'll affect your students.

26:16.570 --> 26:17.730
It'll be on their streets,

26:17.910 --> 26:20.276
and everything you've done for them will
have been for nothing.

26:21.450 --> 26:22.530
I need your help.

26:25.790 --> 26:27.451
We can do a lot of good together.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.456
I'd have to cancel
my evening classes...

26:30.630 --> 26:31.619
Hey, listen. Hey.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.003
If it helps, you can forget about rent
this month.

26:35.720 --> 26:36.755
I already said no.

26:38.300 --> 26:39.585
I bought your building.

26:43.850 --> 26:45.090
I'm your new landlord.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.311
I want the leak under my sink fixed.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.019
As the memo ind/eaten;

27:03.200 --> 27:06.988
the class action suit against
our Staten Island chemical plant

27:07.160 --> 27:10.493
has escalated rather quickly.

27:11.710 --> 27:16.204
I had hoped that Mr Rand would be here

27:16.710 --> 27:19.372
to speak for his actions, but...

27:20.720 --> 27:23.291
the concept of work hours
is still foreign to him.

27:29.310 --> 27:32.859
However, we're a team and we need
to support our colleague

27:33.020 --> 27:37.730
as he continues his transition
back to this life and this company.

27:37.900 --> 27:43.816
So... let us do what we do best
and save the day.

27:44.990 --> 27:49.495
I've carefully weighed our options.
And after consulting with Joy...

27:50.460 --> 27:52.109
I've reached a conclusion.

27:53.830 --> 27:56.549
Settling would be a mistake.

27:59.590 --> 28:03.629
Paying these people off admits there's
something to hide, when there isn't.

28:03.970 --> 28:07.519
This was an act of pure manipulation,
and I'm calling their bluff.

28:07.890 --> 28:10.302
I think you might be letting right
and wrong

28:10.480 --> 28:12.436
interfere with what's best
for the company, Ward.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.726
Really, Lawrence?

28:13.900 --> 28:16.186
Are you willing to sacrifice $200 million

28:16.360 --> 28:19.932
during one of the most challenging
fiscal years this company has ever had?

28:20.110 --> 28:23.443
The bad publicity could cost us even more
in the long run.

28:23.820 --> 28:25.776
Can we honestly take that kind of risk?

28:25.950 --> 28:27.486
We settle here,

28:27.700 --> 28:32.239
and suddenly everyone is knocking
at the door, looking for a handout.

28:32.420 --> 28:34.126
This looks bad.

28:34.290 --> 28:35.780
They'll boycott our products.

28:39.420 --> 28:42.002
If there is one thing
that we can all agree on,

28:42.260 --> 28:45.252
it's that my brother has never given us
a reason to doubt him.

28:47.140 --> 28:48.505
Look at his track record.

28:49.270 --> 28:51.591
Every decision has been impeccable.

28:51.770 --> 28:57.265
I may not always see it at the time,
but he has never once failed this company.

28:58.610 --> 29:00.100
If we can trust Ward,

29:00.820 --> 29:02.811
we can trust this is a risk worth taking.

29:06.740 --> 29:08.446
Shall we have the vote?

29:23.670 --> 29:24.830
Awesome.

29:39.400 --> 29:40.515
I think I may lose my lunch

29:40.690 --> 29:43.067
watching you disgrace my katana
with your
WUX/a
bullshit.

29:45.530 --> 29:47.907
All right. Show me your style.

30:27.660 --> 30:28.979
You're pretty good.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.366
It's just meant to be used
the Japanese way.

30:37.670 --> 30:38.785
Hey.

30:40.330 --> 30:41.536
Check this out.

31:00.690 --> 31:01.850
You're amazing.

31:07.820 --> 31:10.106
Play time's over. Let's get going.

31:10.780 --> 31:12.065
We need your phone to take pics.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.288
- You got it?
- Uh... Yeah.

31:18.540 --> 31:19.609
Everything all right?

31:19.790 --> 31:21.917
My phone was on silent
for meditation.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.331
The office has been calling.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.456
Are we doing this or what?

31:26.510 --> 31:27.579
Lead the way.

31:29.340 --> 31:31.797
Danie/ Rand ’s miraculous return
to Rano’ Enterpr/ses

31:31.970 --> 31:33.597
is making headlines once again,

31:33.760 --> 31:37.218
after a Video where he apologises
for a corporate scano’a/

31:37.390 --> 31:39.267
puts the fate of the company at stake.

31:39.440 --> 31:40.634
Suck on that, Dad.

31:40.810 --> 31:42.437
A spokesperson
for the class action suit . .

31:42.610 --> 31:44.259
. . . claimed that Rano’ Enterprises

31:44.360 --> 31:45.645
callous/y turned a blind eye

31:45.820 --> 31:48.641
when it was brought to their attention
that a chemical plant

31:48.820 --> 31:49.946
may have been respon5/b/e

31:50.110 --> 31:53.159
for 15 cases of cancer in a Staten Island
neighbourhooo;

31:53.320 --> 31:55.697
endangering the lives
of innocent ch/io'ren.

32:55.800 --> 32:56.926
Better put that hood up.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.262
- Does it bother you?
- What?

33:05.190 --> 33:06.555
That everyone knows me now.

33:06.730 --> 33:09.642
It doesn't bother you?
All that attention seems annoying.

33:09.820 --> 33:11.276
Ah, I got used to it as a kid.

33:11.360 --> 33:13.442
Well, just watch yourself.

33:14.070 --> 33:15.150
How so?

33:15.490 --> 33:17.947
You've gone from homeless man
to billionaire in a matter of days.

33:18.280 --> 33:22.990
All that money, press, power,
makes you a target.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.610
People may try to take advantage.

33:27.580 --> 33:28.626
You didn't.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.289
Hey!

33:39.300 --> 33:41.302
Those guards are carrying machine guns!

33:41.470 --> 33:44.268
Yeah, 'cause they haven't got the faintest
idea how to fight.

33:44.980 --> 33:46.095
This wasn't the deal.

33:47.270 --> 33:50.433
You can go home if you want.
Eat leftover takeout,

33:50.610 --> 33:52.931
wait for the repairman
to fix your kitchen sink.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.060
Fight strangers in cages.

33:55.740 --> 33:57.059
You think I'm proud of that?

33:57.320 --> 33:59.447
Come on. It is what it is.

34:02.290 --> 34:03.780
First time I fought in the cage...

34:04.620 --> 34:07.032
I convinced myself
it was just about the money.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.241
For my students, for my dojo.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.949
Then I went a second time.

34:13.710 --> 34:14.870
It's okay.

34:15.300 --> 34:16.710
It feels good, winning.

34:17.090 --> 34:19.331
What felt good was hurting those guys.

34:20.930 --> 34:22.136
Really good.

34:23.060 --> 34:24.209
Scared me.

34:24.770 --> 34:28.763
Yeah, well...
the world hasn't exactly been kind to us.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.977
But maybe doing something like this...

34:37.070 --> 34:39.277
Walk where I walk,
and they'll never see us.

34:52.500 --> 34:53.740
Hey, come here.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.549
Thanks for doing this.

35:11.730 --> 35:14.437
Don't thank me yet.

35:16.150 --> 35:18.198
It's just nice having someone to count on.

35:20.860 --> 35:22.191
You have the Meachums.

35:23.280 --> 35:24.360
Joy...

35:27.370 --> 35:28.496
Do you have someone?

35:32.920 --> 35:34.410
Let's just get this over with.

36:14.750 --> 36:15.739
Hey.

36:17.670 --> 36:21.049
If it sounded like I was prying earlier,
I apologise.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.136
I'm not good at this stuff.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.629
What stuff?

36:28.930 --> 36:30.056
Talking.

36:33.850 --> 36:35.010
If it helps...

36:35.610 --> 36:39.569
I don't even know what I'm doing or saying
until it's taken the wrong way, so...

36:43.200 --> 36:45.691
I'm sorry if I misread your intentions
with the takeout.

36:48.290 --> 36:49.655
As Lord Tuan says,

36:50.660 --> 36:53.458
"One never really knows
one's own true intentions."

36:54.250 --> 36:55.410
So...

37:01.590 --> 37:04.172
Yeah, you might as well.
What's our timeframe on that?

37:04.340 --> 37:06.968
Hey, we need to get closer.

37:44.170 --> 37:46.297
All right. Here it comes.

37:46.510 --> 37:47.579
Open 'em up.

38:01.650 --> 38:03.186
What the hell is that?

38:04.950 --> 38:06.019
Supplies?

38:07.030 --> 38:08.156
I don't know.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.620
Danny.

38:20.790 --> 38:23.372
Look, we're on the right track, okay?
Trust me.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.500
It's just more equipment.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.251
Why would they need guns
unless they have something to hide?

38:34.560 --> 38:35.800
All right.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.686
This is the one. It's gotta be.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.410
Keep an eye out for me.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.701
Wait, what?

39:03.170 --> 39:04.410
Danny!

39:54.180 --> 39:55.670
Let's lock this one up.

40:12.360 --> 40:13.440
Shit.

41:29.650 --> 41:31.311
Danny...

41:59.050 --> 42:01.598
Has found its way
nicely to Marks

42:01.770 --> 42:02.964
Up the ﬁeld.

42:03.810 --> 42:04.970
Oh, that’s a lo ve/y ball.

42:07.600 --> 42:08.851
Who are you?

42:09.980 --> 42:11.186
Who are you?

42:11.730 --> 42:13.357
Radovan, the chemist.

42:14.860 --> 42:16.270
I'm Danny.

44:09.600 --> 44:11.556
Hey, you're coming with me.

44:11.730 --> 44:13.857
No. Leave me, I beg of you.

44:14.020 --> 44:16.602
I got you. Come on, I got you.

45:15.580 --> 45:17.832
That was crazy. How did you...

45:19.090 --> 45:20.159
Is he shot?

45:20.340 --> 45:23.002
He's been stabbed.
We need to get him to a hospital.

45:23.170 --> 45:24.216
Jump in.

45:24.380 --> 45:28.043
You don't_understand. _
I'm a wanted man in several countries...

45:28.680 --> 45:31.171
unless they find me first.

45:32.600 --> 45:34.636
If we don't help him, he's gonna die.

45:36.690 --> 45:37.725
Oh...

45:38.650 --> 45:40.891
We know a nurse.

45:41.480 --> 45:44.483
I'm sure you're aware of this.
That video has gone viral.

45:55.250 --> 45:56.239
Ward?

45:58.500 --> 45:59.535
Ward.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.080
Hey.

46:03.420 --> 46:05.172
- Hey, wake up.
- Mm.

46:07.970 --> 46:10.131
Look at me. What did you take?

46:11.010 --> 46:12.591
Tell me what you took. I need to know.

46:13.220 --> 46:14.175
Ward!

46:15.600 --> 46:16.589
Mm.

46:18.440 --> 46:19.850
I'm fine.

46:23.320 --> 46:25.231
Well, that makes one of us.

46:26.320 --> 46:27.856
All right, look, I don't know
what's going on here,

46:28.030 --> 46:31.522
but I do know that we have a problem,
and I need you in your right mind

46:31.700 --> 46:33.440
to help me figure out how to correct it.

46:42.250 --> 46:44.548
Shouldn't listen to Joy.

46:44.800 --> 46:45.789
Hmm.

46:46.720 --> 46:47.869
Mm-hm.

46:49.890 --> 46:51.209
Why are you doing this to yourself, Ward?

46:56.730 --> 46:58.049
Doing it to him.

46:58.940 --> 47:00.396
Who? Danny?

47:01.440 --> 47:02.600
Shh.

47:05.110 --> 47:06.316
He'll hear.

47:09.490 --> 47:10.696
Okay.

47:13.580 --> 47:15.070
Hey, um...

47:17.290 --> 47:18.860
You're scaring me.

47:22.290 --> 47:23.587
No way out.

47:25.630 --> 47:26.699
Yes, there is.

47:28.340 --> 47:30.501
We're gonna fix this, okay?

47:33.050 --> 47:34.176
Mm.

47:36.390 --> 47:37.550
Mm.

47:39.100 --> 47:40.431
You stood by me.

47:45.610 --> 47:46.850
We're family.

47:51.990 --> 47:53.275
Oh, God.

47:54.240 --> 47:56.322
- Give me your credit card.
- Yeah.

47:56.740 --> 47:57.650
Hey.

47:57.830 --> 47:59.366
Whatever it costs. Here.

48:01.830 --> 48:03.457
His lung is collapsing.

48:04.000 --> 48:04.989
He's going into shock.

48:05.170 --> 48:06.455
I have to improvise a chest seal.

48:16.850 --> 48:18.465
When he inhales...

48:20.480 --> 48:23.722
the card should suck into the wound...

48:24.860 --> 48:28.739
Stop the air from going into his chest and
collapsing his lung.

48:29.900 --> 48:32.983
When he exhales...

48:33.660 --> 48:35.480
The one unsealed side...

48:36.990 --> 48:38.196
Should...

48:39.910 --> 48:42.071
Allow the air to escape.

48:43.920 --> 48:45.285
And let his lung...

48:46.790 --> 48:48.417
Re-expand.

49:07.900 --> 49:08.935
That was impressive.

49:10.280 --> 49:11.850
Hope you don't want your card back.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.770
What are we gonna do with him?

49:17.160 --> 49:18.900
I was hoping he could stay here.

49:20.290 --> 49:21.530
I have lessons here, I...

49:21.700 --> 49:24.362
We can move him to your bedroom.
We'll figure something out.

49:24.870 --> 49:26.246
I'll hire security guards.

49:26.420 --> 49:27.956
You can't trust anyone!

49:30.460 --> 49:32.166
Hey, hey, hey. Relax.

49:32.340 --> 49:35.002
- Take me back. Take me back.
- Shh. No, you need to relax.

49:35.180 --> 49:36.636
It's okay, you're safe here.

49:37.600 --> 49:39.340
- Sabina.
- Hey, shh...

49:39.510 --> 49:40.716
Is that your wife?

49:41.470 --> 49:42.596
Do you want us to call her?

49:42.770 --> 49:44.010
My daughter.

49:44.640 --> 49:45.800
They have her.

49:46.770 --> 49:47.930
Who has her?

49:49.440 --> 49:50.566
The Hand.

49:52.530 --> 49:53.849
Oh, shit!

49:54.740 --> 49:56.230
You gotta be kidding me.

49:57.370 --> 49:58.359
What?

50:01.240 --> 50:02.696
You know about the Hand?

50:03.870 --> 50:04.746
Yeah.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.160
What do you know?

50:08.380 --> 50:11.338
That you just started a war by taking him
from them.

50:11.500 --> 50:12.660
Do you realise that?

50:13.590 --> 50:16.923
My colleague at Metro-General Hospital
was gutted.

50:19.430 --> 50:21.216
It was an army of ninjas...

50:21.390 --> 50:23.096
...and they tried to kill me, too.

50:25.810 --> 50:27.220
It was all covered up.

50:28.480 --> 50:29.970
Forced me to quit my job.

50:31.610 --> 50:32.929
They've been here all along.

50:33.110 --> 50:35.180
The Hand is everywhere.

50:38.110 --> 50:39.657
Why did they want you here in New York?

50:39.820 --> 50:41.117
Heroin.

50:42.080 --> 50:44.196
I invented their formula.

50:48.580 --> 50:50.491
You were gonna make it here and export it
to the world.

50:50.670 --> 50:51.659
Yes.

50:52.300 --> 50:53.665
He's the source.

50:55.970 --> 50:57.369
That's what the Hand does.

50:58.050 --> 51:00.507
They kidnap children
to control their parents.

51:01.390 --> 51:02.675
I've seen it myself.

51:06.730 --> 51:09.016
Sabina is all that matters.

51:11.110 --> 51:12.316
Then I'll find her.

51:16.190 --> 51:17.691
Wait a minute.

51:18.150 --> 51:22.439
Okay, this is not something a rich kid
from the Upper West Side

51:22.620 --> 51:24.030
can just "handle," okay?

51:24.200 --> 51:28.614
This is a job that requires someone with
special...

51:29.920 --> 51:30.955
skills.

51:32.130 --> 51:33.245
Exactly.

51:33.710 --> 51:36.508
Okay, we all have our limitations.
You have to accept yours.

51:36.670 --> 51:37.659
Listen...

51:38.880 --> 51:41.007
...I know I'm not the best businessman...

51:41.180 --> 51:43.751
...and I don't think
I'll be the CEO my father was.

51:43.930 --> 51:44.965
But this?

51:45.890 --> 51:48.131
I've been training my whole life for this.

51:49.640 --> 51:52.768
This is the one thing I know I can do
better than anyone else.

51:54.020 --> 51:56.147
I am the only one who can defeat them.

52:00.740 --> 52:04.153
God! My mother says I can't escape
meeting people like you.

52:05.240 --> 52:06.480
That it's my destiny.

52:10.330 --> 52:13.538
'Cause if you really believe that you can
take these sons of bitches out...

52:16.000 --> 52:17.752
...then I have to believe, too.

52:21.550 --> 52:23.086
But going against them on your own,

52:23.260 --> 52:25.387
that's some foolish bullshit,
no matter who you are.

52:27.640 --> 52:28.766
He's not alone.

52:31.850 --> 52:32.930
Hey...

52:34.150 --> 52:35.890
I can't ask anything more from you.

52:36.980 --> 52:38.277
You've done enough already.

52:40.110 --> 52:41.270
You don't have to.

52:44.120 --> 52:45.235
This is my choice.

53:12.100 --> 53:14.898
I don't know who this guy was
or where he came from,

53:15.610 --> 53:16.804
but he could fight.

53:21.490 --> 53:24.311
I'm telling you, he punched through
solid metal with his bare hands.

53:24.660 --> 53:26.230
His hands?

53:27.660 --> 53:30.072
Are you sure it wasn't his fist?

53:33.210 --> 53:34.700
I guess.

53:45.640 --> 53:46.755
KneeL
