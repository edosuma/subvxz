WEBVTT

00:00.115 --> 00:01.714
I really love my dad and brother,

00:01.749 --> 00:03.860
but sometimes I don't fully understand

00:03.862 --> 00:06.458
their male-bonding
rituals, especially this one.

00:06.459 --> 00:07.931
- Boy battle!
- Boy battle!

00:07.999 --> 00:09.366
Let's go. Come on!

00:09.435 --> 00:10.766
How are you gonna
win regionals next week

00:10.836 --> 00:12.302
if you don't know the fundamentals?

00:12.370 --> 00:15.671
Some of the rituals are
just too gay, even for me.

00:15.740 --> 00:18.674
Okay, if purple nurples are legal...

00:18.743 --> 00:21.010
Aah! Oh, god! Ah!

00:21.079 --> 00:22.545
Jimmy, listen, that's enough!

00:22.613 --> 00:25.014
Hey, hey, hey!

00:25.083 --> 00:27.550
Take your fight club down
to your divorce apartment.

00:27.618 --> 00:29.685
I'm sorry I fought for that,
'cause it really sounds weird.

00:29.754 --> 00:30.954
Let's just call it a basement.

00:31.021 --> 00:32.488
Also, I was cleaning out the garage.

00:32.557 --> 00:34.056
What would you like me
to do with this tent?

00:34.124 --> 00:36.492
Look at that.

00:36.561 --> 00:38.728
This is the tent I
bought when you were born

00:38.796 --> 00:40.730
so I could take you camping.

00:40.798 --> 00:42.832
Huh. I don't remember that.

00:42.900 --> 00:44.833
Well, again, you were just born.

00:44.902 --> 00:46.068
Well, what do you say, Jimmy?

00:46.136 --> 00:47.469
You want to take her out
this weekend, break it in?

00:47.537 --> 00:49.004
Can we use leaves as toilet paper?

00:49.073 --> 00:50.705
I've always wanted to try that.

00:50.774 --> 00:52.908
Oh, of course we
can, but not all of them.

00:52.977 --> 00:54.743
Remember, "leaves of
three, let them be,"

00:54.811 --> 00:56.478
especially when it comes to your butt.

00:56.546 --> 00:58.413
That's very good advice, Pat.

00:58.482 --> 01:01.249
Also, if a grizzly
bear attacks, don't run.

01:01.317 --> 01:03.050
Just puff yourself up to
make yourself look bigger.

01:03.119 --> 01:04.150
Have fun.

01:04.220 --> 01:06.554
Well, this is gonna be great, huh?

01:06.623 --> 01:09.323
Start a new tradition
with the O'Neal men.

01:12.629 --> 01:14.061
Aren't you forgetting something?

01:14.130 --> 01:16.230
Oh, good call, Kenny.

01:16.299 --> 01:18.266
Eileen, could you make
us some sandwiches?

01:18.334 --> 01:20.902
Uh, real men make
their own sandwiches!

01:20.970 --> 01:22.937
That's not why I went "ahem."

01:23.006 --> 01:24.372
I went "ahem"

01:24.440 --> 01:26.107
because if you're going on
a father/son camping trip,

01:26.175 --> 01:29.110
shouldn't you take all of your sons?

01:31.247 --> 01:33.614
What's so funny?

01:33.682 --> 01:35.749
Kenny, come on. You hate nature.

01:35.818 --> 01:36.950
I do not.

01:37.019 --> 01:38.051
Don't you remember what happened

01:38.120 --> 01:39.620
when you went to the
butterfly sanctuary?

01:39.688 --> 01:41.555
There, on that
young man's shoulder,

01:41.624 --> 01:44.425
is the very rare incandescent luna moth.

01:44.493 --> 01:47.694
Only 30 of them
exist in the United States.

01:49.864 --> 01:51.798
My point is, just because I'm gay

01:51.866 --> 01:55.135
doesn't mean I can't
do man things, you know?

01:55.203 --> 01:58.738
Like bonding with my brother
and my dad on a camping trip.

01:58.807 --> 02:01.874
I mean, "Into the Woods" is
one of my favorite musicals.

02:01.944 --> 02:03.543
Listen, if this is
something you really want to do,

02:03.611 --> 02:04.945
of course you can come.

02:05.013 --> 02:06.078
Come on.

02:06.147 --> 02:08.413
First job... take that tent outside,

02:08.483 --> 02:10.149
- make sure it's got a rain fly.
- Rain?!

02:10.884 --> 02:12.952
You think it might rain?

02:13.020 --> 02:16.965
Synced and corrected by VitoSilans

02:18.025 --> 02:20.560
Okay, I'm off to confirmation class.

02:20.628 --> 02:21.994
Your last one.

02:22.063 --> 02:23.829
It's really not that big of a deal, Mom.

02:23.897 --> 02:25.097
It's the biggest deal.

02:25.166 --> 02:27.266
In just a week, the archbishop
will confirm you

02:27.335 --> 02:28.800
as an adult member of the church.

02:28.869 --> 02:30.269
My little Catholic girl

02:30.338 --> 02:32.471
is becoming a little Catholic woman.

02:32.539 --> 02:34.506
Well, I'm gonna grab a
little Catholic apple.

02:34.575 --> 02:35.941
You want to get some
coverage of that, too?

02:36.010 --> 02:38.477
Don't be ridiculous. Of
course I do. Hold it up.

02:40.547 --> 02:43.281
Where's Kenny?

02:43.350 --> 02:44.783
Do you think he changed his mind?

02:44.852 --> 02:46.451
He most certainly did not!

02:48.000 --> 02:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:02.668 --> 03:04.802
What's up, muchachos?

03:04.871 --> 03:07.038
Kenny, we're going for
one night, not one lifetime.

03:07.107 --> 03:08.706
I know. I know this seems like a lot,

03:08.774 --> 03:10.708
but last night, I watched
a wilderness expert

03:10.776 --> 03:12.843
demonstrate the ins and
outs of outdoor survival.

03:12.912 --> 03:14.512
- Bear Grylls?
- Reese Witherspoon.

03:14.580 --> 03:16.213
I watched "Wild" twice.

03:16.281 --> 03:19.483
So, anything we might
need is in these three bags.

03:19.552 --> 03:22.987
Oh, hey, who wants a luna bar?

03:25.024 --> 03:26.991
"Whole nutrition bar for women"?

03:27.059 --> 03:28.358
Yeah, I know. I looked at the
packaging and saw a moon,

03:28.427 --> 03:29.559
and I thought "camping!"

03:29.628 --> 03:31.628
Kenny, you can't take all
these bags. Pick one.

03:31.696 --> 03:33.663
Come on, but the... these bags

03:33.732 --> 03:36.799
contain the necessary
tools for survival.

03:41.573 --> 03:42.939
We really need this?

03:43.008 --> 03:44.908
I don't know how you're gonna
make a cappuccino without foam,

03:44.976 --> 03:47.410
but, sure, I guess
we're the Donner Party.

03:53.251 --> 03:55.852
Feel my hands.

03:55.921 --> 03:57.001
Feel how soft my hands are.

03:57.055 --> 03:59.689
Why are they so spongy?

03:59.758 --> 04:01.257
Because of the dead sea mineral mud.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.325
It's in the lotion my boyfriend, Yossi,

04:03.394 --> 04:04.826
sells at his kiosk in the mall.

04:04.895 --> 04:06.862
Well, hopefully he treats
you better than the guy

04:06.931 --> 04:08.830
who sells pillow pets at
his kiosk in the mall.

04:08.899 --> 04:10.366
I can't help it. I have a type.

04:10.435 --> 04:12.000
Which dress do you like better?

04:12.070 --> 04:13.669
I'm not sure how to say this,

04:13.737 --> 04:16.539
but trying to dress younger
than your age always backfires.

04:16.607 --> 04:18.505
- Remember my overalls?
- I'll never forget.

04:18.576 --> 04:20.096
You weren't wearing a shirt underneath.

04:20.110 --> 04:22.043
No, the dress isn't for me.

04:22.112 --> 04:24.112
It's for Shannon's confirmation.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.081
She's at her last class right now.

04:26.149 --> 04:29.851
I hate to break it to you, but
I just saw her at the mall.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.720
Oh, I seriously doubt that.

04:31.789 --> 04:33.388
It's probably just
someone who looks like Shannon.

04:33.457 --> 04:35.457
No, I said, "Hi, Shannon."
She said, "Hey, Aunt Jodi."

04:35.525 --> 04:37.024
And then I tried to
sell her some lotion.

04:37.094 --> 04:37.925
What?

04:37.994 --> 04:38.926
I'm sorry,

04:38.995 --> 04:40.128
but Yossi had to go to the bathroom,

04:40.197 --> 04:41.529
and I offered to watch his kiosk.

04:41.598 --> 04:43.565
I mean, he's all alone out there!

04:43.633 --> 04:45.133
Oh, you're talking
about the Shannon thing.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.033
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:46.103 --> 04:48.136
That's not good.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.105
Ugh, it's so hot out!

04:50.173 --> 04:52.439
I can feel the sweat
pooling in my belly button!

04:52.508 --> 04:55.142
I don't know why you
chose to wear jeans on a hike,

04:55.211 --> 04:57.244
denim being one of the
least breathable fabrics.

04:57.313 --> 04:59.480
I compensated with these flip-flops,

04:59.548 --> 05:01.582
one of the most breathable shoes.

05:01.651 --> 05:03.484
How you holding up back there, Kenny?

05:03.552 --> 05:05.319
Doing all right with
that monster bag of yours?

05:05.387 --> 05:09.889
Mm. I infused my water
with lemon and cucumber.

05:09.958 --> 05:11.492
Now, if "Wild" taught us anything,

05:11.560 --> 05:14.428
it's that we are all
capable of more than we think.

05:14.497 --> 05:17.564
Also, don't do heroin in an alleyway

05:17.633 --> 05:19.633
or someone might steal your wallet.

05:19.701 --> 05:20.967
Ah, damn it!

05:21.036 --> 05:22.636
I blew a flip-flop.

05:22.704 --> 05:24.671
Why would you wear those hiking?

05:24.740 --> 05:27.073
You said that we were camping, which
means that we sleep in a tent

05:27.142 --> 05:29.242
and we eat beans and then we go home.

05:29.310 --> 05:32.278
Not to worry... I have an
extra pair of Timberlands in my bag.

05:32.347 --> 05:35.515
What? You brought an
extra pair of hiking boots?

05:35.583 --> 05:36.983
Yeah, I didn't want
to end up like Reese,

05:37.052 --> 05:38.151
you know, when her toenail falls off

05:38.219 --> 05:39.619
and then she throws
her shoe in the canyon.

05:39.688 --> 05:42.208
And then she screams because it
reminds her of shooting a horse.

05:42.223 --> 05:43.656
Didn't really get that part.

05:43.724 --> 05:45.258
Well, hey, thank
goodness Kenny's prepared.

05:45.326 --> 05:47.760
Hate to risk your feet with
the regionals next week.

05:47.828 --> 05:48.994
Oh, that reminds me.

05:49.063 --> 05:51.130
I was gonna save
this until later, but...

05:54.235 --> 05:55.434
I have so many questions.

05:55.503 --> 05:58.704
Um... I mean, most of
them start with... Why?

05:58.773 --> 05:59.853
Well, they're for your meet.

05:59.874 --> 06:01.394
I got them made for the entire family.

06:01.408 --> 06:03.776
So, if you can't wrestle 'cause
you hurt yourself hiking,

06:03.844 --> 06:05.544
I'm just gonna be a guy
with a boy on his shirt.

06:05.612 --> 06:07.046
A boy in a leotard.

06:07.114 --> 06:08.781
But that's not gonna
happen, thanks to Kenny.

06:08.849 --> 06:10.783
You're really turning into
quite the outdoorsman.

06:10.851 --> 06:13.152
Well, out of the closet and...

06:13.220 --> 06:15.487
♪ Into the woods ♪

06:17.757 --> 06:19.724
How was confirmation class?

06:19.793 --> 06:21.493
Oh, you know,

06:21.562 --> 06:24.829
just the father and the
son and the holy spirit.

06:24.898 --> 06:25.830
The uszh.

06:25.899 --> 06:27.699
I know you weren't in class.

06:27.767 --> 06:30.234
Aunt Jodi said she saw you at the mall.

06:30.303 --> 06:31.969
Do you trust that Yossi guy?

06:32.038 --> 06:33.871
'Cause I'm pretty
sure that dead sea lotion

06:33.940 --> 06:35.472
comes from a dirt lot in Naperville.

06:35.541 --> 06:37.141
Do not change the subject.

06:37.210 --> 06:39.210
Why were you not at confirmation class?

06:39.278 --> 06:41.913
Because I don't want to get confirmed.

06:41.981 --> 06:44.248
Shannon, this is not your choice.

06:44.317 --> 06:45.649
Actually, it is my choice.

06:45.719 --> 06:47.218
Confirmation is supposed to be

06:47.286 --> 06:49.086
the first adult decision
I make in the church.

06:49.121 --> 06:52.656
And before I make that
decision, I have some questions.

06:52.725 --> 06:54.425
Fine. What do you want to know?

06:54.493 --> 06:55.593
Well, to begin with,

06:55.661 --> 06:57.528
if the first two
people were Adam and Eve,

06:57.597 --> 06:59.197
where did Cain and Abel get their wives?

07:00.999 --> 07:02.833
I am sick of this sass.

07:02.901 --> 07:04.201
That's it.

07:04.269 --> 07:05.702
Do I need to bring
in the special forces?

07:05.771 --> 07:07.204
Do you want me to call Father Phil?

07:07.272 --> 07:08.671
Mm, not especially,

07:08.741 --> 07:11.041
but you just have to
do what's right for you.

07:13.311 --> 07:17.214
And that was shade, not sass.

07:17.282 --> 07:18.749
Oh.

07:22.420 --> 07:23.386
Oh!

07:25.257 --> 07:26.389
Well, thanks for bringing this, Kenny.

07:26.458 --> 07:27.557
Gosh, I never even knew

07:27.626 --> 07:30.560
there was such a thing
as a collapsible banjo.

07:30.629 --> 07:32.027
Yeah, saw it on "Shark Tank."

07:32.096 --> 07:34.364
Mark Cuban shot it
down, but I believe in it.

07:34.432 --> 07:35.965
Me too.

07:36.033 --> 07:38.734
Well, nature calls.

07:38.803 --> 07:40.435
If I scream once, I need more leaves,

07:40.504 --> 07:42.204
and if I scream twice, there's a bear.

07:42.273 --> 07:45.374
Your extra-credit hiking
boots are killing my feet.

07:45.442 --> 07:47.810
Oh, well, I have Epsom salts, moleskin.

07:47.879 --> 07:49.378
I may even have an extra pair

07:49.446 --> 07:50.237
of gel inserts in
my bag if you want me...

07:50.238 --> 07:51.337
Okay, we get it.

07:51.382 --> 07:53.282
You're the best camper in the world.

07:53.350 --> 07:55.510
Okay, will you please just
slow your roll a little bit?

07:55.552 --> 07:57.152
- You're making me look bad.
- I'm sorry.

07:57.220 --> 08:00.088
I'm not... I'm not
trying to make you look bad.

08:00.157 --> 08:02.658
I'm trying to make me look good.

08:02.726 --> 08:06.561
Look, I want to be a part of
all the... O'Neal men traditions.

08:06.630 --> 08:09.264
You know, boy battles, nipple pinchin'.

08:09.332 --> 08:12.066
This trip wasn't about you
proving your manhood.

08:12.135 --> 08:13.902
It was a chance for me to soften up Dad

08:13.970 --> 08:15.303
for the news I'm about to drop.

08:15.371 --> 08:17.305
What is it?

08:17.373 --> 08:19.240
I'm gonna tell you,

08:19.309 --> 08:20.574
but you have to promise not to tell Dad.

08:20.643 --> 08:21.976
I promise.

08:22.045 --> 08:23.111
I quit wrestling.

08:23.180 --> 08:25.280
You what?

08:25.348 --> 08:26.781
I quit the team.

08:26.849 --> 08:28.616
There are no regionals next week.

08:28.685 --> 08:31.251
Uh, there are. I am just not in them.

08:31.321 --> 08:35.923
Jimmy, wrestling is
your whole entire life.

08:35.991 --> 08:37.157
And Dad's.

08:37.226 --> 08:39.327
He is making some very,
very poor fashion decisions

08:39.395 --> 08:40.594
based on it.

08:40.663 --> 08:42.696
- This is going to kill him.
- I know!

08:42.764 --> 08:44.198
That's why I haven't told him yet.

08:44.265 --> 08:45.999
But thank you for... for
spelling it out for me.

08:46.068 --> 08:49.002
I'm sorry, but I have
something that is going to cheer you up.

08:51.773 --> 08:53.173
You brought hot chocolate?

08:53.242 --> 08:54.274
Actually...

08:58.880 --> 09:00.647
It's Mexican drinking
cho... you know what?

09:00.716 --> 09:02.215
Just  why
don't you enjoy that?

09:02.283 --> 09:04.317
- Don't forget your garnish.
- No.

09:07.507 --> 09:09.272
I like sandwiches!

09:09.341 --> 09:10.908
Good morning, camper.

09:10.977 --> 09:13.377
It is 6:30. Yeah.

09:13.445 --> 09:16.881
Up and at 'em.

09:16.949 --> 09:18.382
This is balls.

09:18.450 --> 09:20.584
Camping sucks.

09:20.653 --> 09:22.319
This is worse than "Naked and Afraid."

09:22.388 --> 09:24.388
I'm just... I'm cold
and I'm very frustrated.

09:24.456 --> 09:27.391
So, while I was
meditating with the sunrise,

09:27.459 --> 09:28.758
I was thinking,

09:28.827 --> 09:30.827
you should just tell Dad
the truth about wrestling.

09:30.829 --> 09:31.961
I have a better idea.

09:32.031 --> 09:33.630
Last night, while I was
tossing and turning,

09:33.698 --> 09:35.098
I came up with a brilliant plan.

09:35.167 --> 09:37.934
I am going to physically injure myself.

09:38.003 --> 09:40.103
- What?
- Dad said so himself.

09:40.172 --> 09:42.338
If I'm hurt, I can't
camp and I can't wrestle.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.007
It's a one-two punch. It's
two birds, one stone.

09:44.075 --> 09:45.508
It's two for the money! Bang, bang!

09:45.577 --> 09:48.310
Did you eat those
berries I told you to put down?

09:48.379 --> 09:50.446
Of course I did, and
they were delicious.

09:50.515 --> 09:52.749
The points is, is that I'm
not gonna do anything permanent.

09:52.817 --> 09:55.151
You know, just something that
takes two weeks to heal,

09:55.219 --> 09:56.619
and then wresting season will be over.

09:56.688 --> 09:57.753
I have 10 toes.

09:57.821 --> 10:00.789
That's, like... Eight more than I need.

10:00.858 --> 10:02.691
- No...
- Let's go, boys!

10:02.760 --> 10:04.393
- Tough day ahead!
- Okay, no, Jimmy.

10:04.462 --> 10:06.628
You need your toes. You
need all of your toes.

10:06.697 --> 10:08.697
- Just tell Dad the truth.
- I'm sorry, Kenny.

10:08.766 --> 10:10.966
I know you love my
toes, but they got to go.

10:15.505 --> 10:17.439
Thank you so much for
coming, Father Phil.

10:17.507 --> 10:18.574
Oh, my pleasure.

10:18.642 --> 10:20.341
I actually like making house calls.

10:20.410 --> 10:22.711
It's fun to walk down the
street in my priest outfit.

10:22.780 --> 10:25.047
Oh. Well,
I had to do something.

10:25.115 --> 10:26.555
It's my responsibility as her mother

10:26.584 --> 10:28.316
to make sure this confirmation happens.

10:28.385 --> 10:29.985
After that, she can
send herself to hell.

10:30.054 --> 10:31.352
Well, rest assured, Eileen.

10:31.421 --> 10:33.788
I've talked to grooms with
cold feet, grieving widows.

10:33.856 --> 10:36.857
I even had a walk-on part as
a chaplain on "Chicago P.D."

10:36.926 --> 10:39.561
So a doubting
teenager is a piece of cake.

10:39.629 --> 10:40.795
Oh, I hope so.

10:40.863 --> 10:42.964
I've succeeded in
getting two Catholics confirmed,

10:43.032 --> 10:44.865
but this third one is
teetering on the brink.

10:44.934 --> 10:46.201
Yeah, I said I've got it.

10:46.269 --> 10:47.301
Go forth, Father.

10:47.369 --> 10:49.470
Come on back down if you need me.

10:49.538 --> 10:51.205
I don't think I will.

10:51.273 --> 10:53.373
Okay.

10:53.442 --> 10:54.575
- Thank you!
- Enough!

10:54.644 --> 10:56.510
Look, my Mom inviting you over

10:56.579 --> 10:58.545
is a little too "Exorcist" for my taste,

10:58.615 --> 10:59.981
but I have questions

11:00.049 --> 11:01.548
and no one is willing to answer them.

11:01.618 --> 11:04.050
Well, that's what I'm here for.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.719
Now, what are you curious about?

11:05.787 --> 11:07.321
Is it the immaculate conception?

11:07.389 --> 11:09.709
Because a lot of people
confuse that with the virgin birth.

11:09.725 --> 11:11.225
No, that's kid stuff.

11:11.293 --> 11:12.426
Let's not waste each other's time.

11:12.495 --> 11:14.928
What I'm curious about is the pope.

11:14.997 --> 11:16.263
Well, fire away.

11:16.332 --> 11:17.697
How can a group of fallible men

11:17.766 --> 11:19.566
elect a fallible man as their leader

11:19.635 --> 11:21.868
who then becomes
infallible through the election?

11:23.304 --> 11:26.172
The pope is only infallible in
matters of faith and morals

11:26.241 --> 11:28.108
when he's speaking ex cathedra.

11:28.176 --> 11:29.776
Well, that seems like
cherry-picking, but fine.

11:29.845 --> 11:33.546
Next question... if all
God's children are created equal,

11:33.615 --> 11:36.182
how come that infallible
man can't be a woman?

11:36.251 --> 11:38.384
This is why I chose a profession

11:38.453 --> 11:40.520
where I couldn't have children.

11:44.626 --> 11:46.559
All right, you guys hang
out here for a second.

11:46.628 --> 11:48.594
I'm gonna go see if I can
spot Shadow Lake from up there.

11:48.663 --> 11:50.463
Oh, hey, Kenny, you
didn't happen to bring any...

11:50.532 --> 11:52.965
That's my boy.

11:55.502 --> 11:57.202
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:57.271 --> 11:58.904
Which one of these
rocks looks like it'll cause

11:58.973 --> 12:00.773
the most amount of injury but
the least amount of pain?

12:00.841 --> 12:02.107
Just stop. Stop.

12:02.176 --> 12:04.076
Breaking your toe is not the answer.

12:04.145 --> 12:06.545
This is the part in
"Wild" where Reese sees the fox

12:06.613 --> 12:07.546
but it's not really there.

12:07.614 --> 12:08.881
It's not there, Jimmy!

12:08.949 --> 12:11.416
I'm sick of being held to
an impossible standard!

12:11.485 --> 12:13.652
I'm... I'm not a champion wrestler.

12:13.720 --> 12:16.087
I'm not Reese Witherspoon.

12:17.291 --> 12:18.456
This is it. This is definitely the one.

12:18.525 --> 12:20.485
Okay, go distract Dad while
I drop this on my toe.

12:21.795 --> 12:23.562
I always assumed my straight brother

12:23.630 --> 12:25.930
had an easier time bonding with my dad,

12:25.999 --> 12:27.598
but maybe it was harder

12:27.667 --> 12:30.168
because the bar was so much higher.

12:30.236 --> 12:33.137
I'm gonna get you
home with all your toes.

12:33.206 --> 12:35.139
How are... how?

12:35.208 --> 12:37.175
By setting gay
people back a hundred years.

12:39.879 --> 12:41.946
Dad!

12:42.015 --> 12:43.647
I can't do this!

12:43.716 --> 12:45.949
My calves are cramping,

12:46.018 --> 12:47.538
and I'm missing a "Housewives" reunion.

12:47.553 --> 12:50.354
I just... I can't
carry this bag another step.

12:50.423 --> 12:51.822
I need to go home.

12:51.890 --> 12:53.524
What? But you were doing so great.

12:53.593 --> 12:55.859
I'm sorry. I hope you're
not too disappointed.

12:55.928 --> 12:57.494
I'm not disappointed.

12:57.563 --> 12:59.362
I'm proud of how much you've done

12:59.431 --> 13:01.131
and that you were
willing to even give it a go.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.365
Thanks.

13:02.434 --> 13:03.700
Well, guess there's
only one thing to do.

13:03.769 --> 13:05.836
- Go home?
- I'm gonna name a toe after you.

13:05.904 --> 13:07.938
No, nobody's going home.

13:08.006 --> 13:09.606
Jimmy, you're gonna
have to carry Kenny's pack.

13:09.674 --> 13:11.641
- O'Neal men don't quit.
- No, no, I don't think that's...

13:11.710 --> 13:12.943
No, he'll be fine. Don't
worry about him.

13:13.011 --> 13:14.778
It'll build up his
endurance. It's a win-win.

13:14.847 --> 13:16.713
Two birds, one stone. Two for the money.

13:16.781 --> 13:17.780
Bang, bang!

13:17.849 --> 13:20.650
I'm so sorry.

13:22.053 --> 13:24.654
What do you have in here, rocks?

13:24.723 --> 13:26.522
Aw, come on. I don't want to
hear any belly-aching, Jimmy.

13:26.591 --> 13:28.491
This is gonna be great
training for your meet next week.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.726
And if you win, you're on to state.

13:29.794 --> 13:31.461
I already got a great
idea for the shirts, too.

13:31.529 --> 13:33.195
It's gonna be a picture of Jimmy

13:33.264 --> 13:34.864
wearing the shirt on the shirt.

13:34.932 --> 13:36.565
Okay, stop making shirts!

13:36.634 --> 13:39.568
I... I quit the wrestling team.

13:39.637 --> 13:42.004
What? When?

13:42.073 --> 13:43.572
- Last week.
- Well, then there's still time,

13:43.641 --> 13:45.474
'cause you're gonna go
back to that coach on Monday,

13:45.542 --> 13:47.376
tell him you made a mistake, and
ask him to get back on that team.

13:47.444 --> 13:48.744
No, I'm not gonna do that.

13:48.812 --> 13:50.679
- I hate wrestling.
- What?

13:50.748 --> 13:52.481
And also, camping sucks

13:52.549 --> 13:55.350
and should involve way less walking.

13:55.419 --> 13:56.752
Oh! Oh!

13:56.820 --> 13:59.588
And by the way, Kenny
was pretending to be weak.

13:59.657 --> 14:03.692
He is a... he is a very
macho homosexual camper.

14:08.765 --> 14:09.597
How'd it go?

14:09.666 --> 14:11.766
Uh, uh, not well.

14:11.835 --> 14:14.769
Uh, Sh-Shannon has a
lot of difficult questions.

14:14.838 --> 14:15.904
But isn't it your
job to have the answers?

14:15.972 --> 14:17.772
I mean, isn't that
why I asked you over here?

14:17.841 --> 14:19.140
Isn't that what you
promised me you'd do?

14:19.209 --> 14:21.542
Enough with the
questions. You both are relentless.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.912
I have to go.

14:24.980 --> 14:26.714
I'm sorry.

14:26.783 --> 14:29.784
But you said it'd be a piece of cake.

14:29.852 --> 14:31.185
What about the grieving widows?

14:31.253 --> 14:32.553
What about "Chicago P.D."?

14:32.622 --> 14:35.022
I was cut, okay?! I looked in the lens!

14:40.595 --> 14:43.063
Shannon, I don't know
what you asked Father Phil,

14:43.132 --> 14:45.012
but he ran out of here like
he'd seen the devil.

14:46.535 --> 14:47.667
Shannon?

14:54.710 --> 14:56.810
Where did she get a fire ladder?

14:56.878 --> 14:59.912
That's so well-anchored.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.098
Shannon, it's your mother.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.974
I have left several
messages, and I think I tweeted at you.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.602
What is the point having a cellphone

15:08.603 --> 15:11.069
if you don't answer or call me back?

15:11.138 --> 15:12.571
Oh, someone's calling.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.607
Oh, fish! It's Jodi. Hang on.

15:14.675 --> 15:17.777
Jodi, what is it? There's an emergency.

15:17.845 --> 15:20.279
Shannon's run away from
home, and she's abandoned her faith

15:20.347 --> 15:22.080
and her family, and I
have no idea where she is.

15:22.149 --> 15:23.415
I just saw your tweet.

15:23.483 --> 15:25.284
She's at the mall again, and
she just sold me a Pretzel.

15:25.352 --> 15:26.672
What? What are you talking about?

15:26.686 --> 15:27.846
She works at Tilly's Pretzels.

15:27.854 --> 15:29.888
Apparently, that's why
she was here yesterday.

15:29.957 --> 15:32.690
She has a job? She's 14 years old.

15:32.759 --> 15:34.759
She makes pretzels like a 20-year-old.

15:34.828 --> 15:36.094
Maybe you should come by and get her,

15:36.163 --> 15:37.729
and then you can meet
Yossi while you're here.

15:37.798 --> 15:39.398
He's having a great deal on hand lotion.

15:39.433 --> 15:40.732
It's only 99 bucks a bottle.

15:40.801 --> 15:41.900
If you buy one at full price first.

15:41.968 --> 15:44.035
No, I'd rather wait for her here.

15:44.103 --> 15:46.137
And I need to see if
it sticks with Yossi

15:46.205 --> 15:48.706
before I buy any product.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.815
Look, I know this male-bonding
trip sucked for you guys,

15:57.883 --> 16:01.485
but I have to say, it was
a personal triumph for me.

16:01.554 --> 16:04.555
I'm gonna press these wild
flowers in a memory book.

16:06.359 --> 16:08.659
Okay, why
don't you two stop acting

16:08.727 --> 16:10.727
so macho and actually talk?

16:10.796 --> 16:13.964
Fine. Jimmy, are you ready to talk yet?

16:14.032 --> 16:15.966
No, I'm not.

16:16.034 --> 16:17.334
See what I'm dealing with?

16:17.402 --> 16:19.570
I'm gonna go watch the
bulls in my divorce apartment...

16:19.638 --> 16:21.438
I mean my basement!

16:21.507 --> 16:24.407
<i>As annoying as I found their
straight-male rituals,</i>

16:24.477 --> 16:27.243
<i>there was only one way to fix this.</i>

16:27.312 --> 16:29.245
Boy battle!

16:33.751 --> 16:34.717
Boy battle?

16:38.056 --> 16:39.422
Boy battle.

16:39.491 --> 16:41.992
Straight guys are so simple.

16:52.169 --> 16:54.203
See? You love this.

16:54.271 --> 16:56.338
Why on earth would
you want to give it up?

16:56.407 --> 16:58.975
Because you put too much pressure on it.

16:59.043 --> 17:01.443
Me being a wrestler is the
only thing you care about.

17:01.512 --> 17:03.312
What?

17:03.381 --> 17:04.713
That's what you really think?

17:04.781 --> 17:05.881
Yeah.

17:05.949 --> 17:08.183
You even took me on a camping trip,

17:08.252 --> 17:10.852
and all you could talk
about was the match.

17:10.921 --> 17:12.887
I took you on a camping
trip because you're my son

17:12.955 --> 17:14.689
and I like to spend time with you.

17:14.758 --> 17:16.724
And, sure, I like
that you're a wrestler.

17:16.792 --> 17:19.193
- I enjoy going to your matches.
- Enjoy?

17:19.262 --> 17:22.531
You had t-shirts printed for the
whole family with my body on it.

17:22.598 --> 17:24.132
I mean, I look good.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.599
Well, listen, if I'm pressuring you,

17:25.602 --> 17:27.035
it's because you're really
good at wrestling

17:27.103 --> 17:28.737
and I think that's your
ticket into college.

17:28.805 --> 17:30.672
So I can be a wrestler in college?

17:30.741 --> 17:32.306
No, so you can be in college.

17:32.375 --> 17:34.075
I don't know if you pay
attention when your grades come out,

17:34.144 --> 17:36.877
but you get what we
generously call an athlete's report card.

17:36.946 --> 17:40.848
So, you really wanted me to
wrestle for me, not for you?

17:42.252 --> 17:44.752
Look, as far as I'm
concerned, once you get into college,

17:44.820 --> 17:46.487
I don't care if you ever wrap your arms

17:46.556 --> 17:47.855
around another man ever again.

17:49.559 --> 17:52.059
Unless, of course, it's to
give your old man a hug.

17:53.796 --> 17:55.162
Come on.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.266
Attaboy.

18:00.836 --> 18:03.170
See? That's much bet...

18:03.238 --> 18:05.238
Aah!

18:05.307 --> 18:06.573
Oh.

18:06.641 --> 18:10.510
I'll think about it.

18:10.579 --> 18:13.280
Why do I keep
my keys in my back pocket?

18:13.348 --> 18:14.847
Ohh.

18:20.822 --> 18:24.791
All right, let's just
get this over with.

18:29.530 --> 18:33.265
So, is this how it's
gonna be between us?

18:33.334 --> 18:35.034
One day, your father will move out,

18:35.103 --> 18:37.203
Jimmy will move
out, Kenny will move out,

18:37.271 --> 18:40.072
and suddenly I'm just renting a
room to a lying pretzel maker.

18:40.141 --> 18:41.907
Look, I'm sorry I lied to you, Mom,

18:41.976 --> 18:44.243
but I knew you
wouldn't let me have the job.

18:44.312 --> 18:46.945
All this time, I thought
you were in confirmation class,

18:47.014 --> 18:48.914
taking a step towards adulthood.

18:48.983 --> 18:50.423
I am taking a step toward adulthood.

18:50.451 --> 18:51.550
I've been working.

18:51.619 --> 18:53.152
I was there for less than two weeks,

18:53.221 --> 18:54.820
and they made me shift manager.

18:54.888 --> 18:56.888
I have the combination to the safe.

18:56.957 --> 18:58.790
Look, Shannon, I don't
know what else to do.

18:58.859 --> 19:01.893
Your being confirmed is
very important to me.

19:01.962 --> 19:03.795
Isn't that reason enough to do it?

19:03.864 --> 19:05.330
I love going to church as a family,

19:05.398 --> 19:06.898
but I also have a questioning mind,

19:06.967 --> 19:09.300
and it's hard for me to
believe in things I don't see.

19:09.369 --> 19:11.169
That's why I love my job.

19:11.238 --> 19:13.338
I know what I'm doing,
I know why I'm doing it,

19:13.406 --> 19:14.939
and I know who I'm working for.

19:15.008 --> 19:18.343
Okay, then let me ask you a question.

19:18.411 --> 19:20.945
- Have you met Tilly?
- No.

19:21.014 --> 19:23.814
And yet you trust that
at the end of the week,

19:23.883 --> 19:26.417
this Tilly lady will write you a check

19:26.486 --> 19:28.019
for all the hard work you've done.

19:28.087 --> 19:30.621
And then you take that
check and you deposit it in a bank

19:30.690 --> 19:32.823
and trust that they'll keep it for you.

19:32.892 --> 19:34.959
That's faith.

19:35.028 --> 19:36.994
Well, actually, Tilly sold the company

19:37.063 --> 19:38.829
to a private equity firm in 2007,

19:38.898 --> 19:40.965
but I get what you're saying.

19:41.034 --> 19:44.035
I guess if I can give our
failed banking system so much leeway,

19:44.103 --> 19:45.869
maybe I could do the same for god.

19:45.937 --> 19:47.871
You're smarter than most people.

19:47.939 --> 19:49.839
You get that from me.

19:49.908 --> 19:52.209
So, I'm not gonna
make you get confirmed,

19:52.278 --> 19:54.978
and I'm not gonna
make you quit your job.

19:55.047 --> 19:57.981
I'm gonna trust in your
maturity to make the right decision.

19:58.050 --> 20:01.851
I mean, you bought
yourself a fire ladder.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.987
I bought fire
ladders for the whole family.

20:04.056 --> 20:05.789
There's one under each of your beds.

20:05.857 --> 20:07.957
You people never plan for disaster.

20:09.094 --> 20:10.694
Hey.

20:10.762 --> 20:11.861
Where you off to?

20:11.930 --> 20:13.897
- Wrestling practice.
- Really?

20:13.965 --> 20:16.066
It is a good path to
college, and it's easier.

20:16.134 --> 20:17.300
School is hard.

20:18.903 --> 20:19.868
Where you off to?

20:19.937 --> 20:21.370
Confirmation class.

20:21.439 --> 20:22.405
Really?

20:22.473 --> 20:23.739
I figured when it comes to god,

20:23.808 --> 20:25.074
it's like putting your fingers

20:25.142 --> 20:26.542
anywhere near the pretzel-dough cutters.

20:26.611 --> 20:28.744
Better to be safe than sorry.

20:36.253 --> 20:37.920
Are you both crying?

20:37.988 --> 20:41.023
Seriously, you guys need to man up.

20:47.950 --> 20:49.389
Okay, so I think the horse

20:49.390 --> 20:51.376
might represent Reese's lost innocence.

20:51.391 --> 20:52.790
- Mm-hmm.
- She's hot.

20:52.859 --> 20:55.460
She just lost her
toenail and she's crying.

20:55.528 --> 20:57.127
Well, she's hot when she cries.

20:57.196 --> 20:59.396
- Dad, please help me out here.
- Well, she is pretty fit.

20:59.398 --> 21:00.697
She's been hiking for months,

21:00.766 --> 21:02.599
and, you know, she did a
lot of heroin before that,

21:02.668 --> 21:03.828
so, yeah, she's gonna be slim.

21:03.836 --> 21:05.903
Oh, she's finally gonna take a shower.

21:05.972 --> 21:07.104
Good for her.

21:07.173 --> 21:09.340
Yeah, we get to see Reese's pieces.

21:09.408 --> 21:11.308
No, male bonding is overrated.

21:11.377 --> 21:12.576
- Hey!
- Come here.

21:12.644 --> 21:13.677
What are you doing?

21:13.746 --> 21:15.645
Get off of me! Get off of me!

21:15.714 --> 21:17.113
I don't boy battle!
