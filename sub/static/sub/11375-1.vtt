01:34.437 --> 01:38.316
- So, Betsy, why am I doing this?
- You're tired, stressed,

01:38.441 --> 01:43.237
and they'll carry you out of the office
on a stretcher if you don't get some rest.

01:43.362 --> 01:47.033
- Duncan can take care of things.
- Duncan? Are you kidding me?

01:47.158 --> 01:52.163
He is your partner. And believe it or not,
he is just as worried about you as I am.

01:52.288 --> 01:57.293
Go. It's a vacation. You're late already.
I won't let you put this off this time.

01:57.418 --> 02:00.129
OK, OK, I'm not gonna put it off.

02:00.254 --> 02:03.549
But I am taking those plans.
They're not good enough.

02:03.674 --> 02:07.136
Now, how do you know that this spa
is any good anyway?

02:07.261 --> 02:09.305
Fine. I-I'm fine.

02:10.139 --> 02:14.268
- Don't forget to exercise.
- Exercise? Exercise is not rest.

02:14.477 --> 02:18.898
- Sure you know where you're going?
- Yes. I'm very good with directions.

02:19.023 --> 02:22.109
Betsy, I'm completely lost. I'm sorry.

02:23.986 --> 02:26.030
I thought I was on 128,

02:26.155 --> 02:30.243
but I'm in the middle of the woods,
and, uh, I don't like it.

02:32.536 --> 02:34.622
Yeah. Hang on a second.

02:35.164 --> 02:37.667
OK, wait. I've got... I've got the map.

02:37.792 --> 02:42.213
I've got the map here. You know what?
There's... there's no Bear Mountain.

02:42.338 --> 02:45.091
There's no sign. I've been looking for it.

02:45.216 --> 02:47.843
Yeah, I did. I... I...

02:47.969 --> 02:50.680
Oh! Wow, wait. There's the sign. I got it.

02:50.805 --> 02:53.766
All right. I'll see you in a week.

02:53.891 --> 02:55.935
OK, thanks. Bye.

03:09.448 --> 03:13.494
Your room's in the Timber Lodge,
which is to the left.

03:14.120 --> 03:18.541
In the main lodge, we have a full
weight room, Lifecycles, step machines,

03:18.666 --> 03:22.670
spa, yoga, aerobics, cycling workouts.

03:22.837 --> 03:25.756
I was really hoping for, like, a quick fix.

03:25.881 --> 03:29.385
Uh, do you have anything
that involves just lying down?

03:30.011 --> 03:32.555
- A massage?
- Yeah.

03:33.055 --> 03:36.142
Um, I'll have one a day, and not too early.

03:36.976 --> 03:38.686
How's 10am?

03:38.811 --> 03:40.354
Eleven?

03:40.479 --> 03:42.940
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

03:45.484 --> 03:47.528
Oh!

03:48.487 --> 03:50.448
Virgil! Oh!

03:50.573 --> 03:52.533
God! There... Oh!

03:52.658 --> 03:55.244
No, no, no, no. Harder. Just right...

03:55.369 --> 03:56.412
Oh!

03:56.537 --> 04:00.875
No, you can't stop. Just a little more...

04:01.000 --> 04:03.377
- Come on, time's up.
- No, no... Oh!

04:06.172 --> 04:08.633
Virgil, you have to come live with me.

04:08.758 --> 04:11.344
What would your husband say?

04:11.469 --> 04:14.013
- I'll see you.
- Oh...

04:14.138 --> 04:17.099
That's it. I'm getting a divorce!

04:19.226 --> 04:21.853
- Amy, are you out there?
- Yeah?

04:21.978 --> 04:24.023
Come on in.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.697
- Hi, I'm Virgil.
- Hi.

04:31.822 --> 04:35.701
Take your clothes off
and hop up on the table. I'll be right there.

04:35.826 --> 04:37.787
You sound like a genius at this.

04:37.912 --> 04:42.375
Oh, yeah, Einstein, Gandhi...
Virgil Adamson, massage therapist.

04:44.293 --> 04:48.464
Do you want me...
sunny-side up or down?

04:49.298 --> 04:52.218
Mm, on your stomach, I think.

04:54.637 --> 04:57.890
I'm gonna start off... somewhat deep.

04:59.684 --> 05:04.313
And, uh, you let me know
if you want anything deeper.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.606
Deeper is good.

05:05.731 --> 05:08.276
Where I come from, all you get is shallow.

05:08.442 --> 05:11.237
Ah! A New Yorker.

05:14.073 --> 05:16.117
Now, how do you know that?

05:16.242 --> 05:18.619
Oh, it's all here in the shoulders.

05:19.829 --> 05:24.292
Here's that honking horn
of the taxi you missed.

05:24.417 --> 05:27.128
Here's the... rumble of the subway.

05:27.253 --> 05:30.339
Right in here is the screech of the wheels

05:30.464 --> 05:33.843
cos you're late,
and that's why you have that tension.

05:33.968 --> 05:36.721
You... get into the city very often?

05:36.846 --> 05:41.601
Do you want to talk or a... massage?

05:41.726 --> 05:44.395
Shutting up now.

05:55.281 --> 05:56.908
Mm-mm.

06:04.290 --> 06:06.334
Mm...

06:12.715 --> 06:15.259
That too deep?

06:15.384 --> 06:19.180
No, um... It's... fine.

06:21.349 --> 06:23.476
Oh, it is too deep.

06:24.685 --> 06:27.355
Maybe we should stop for today.

06:27.480 --> 06:30.316
Here's a Kleenex.

06:30.441 --> 06:33.736
I don't... I don't know why I'm crying.

06:38.115 --> 06:41.577
There must've been a lot of stuff built up.
I'm sorry.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.079
Sure.

06:44.163 --> 06:48.167
I'm gonna go now,
unless you'd like me to stay.

06:48.292 --> 06:50.253
Could you, please?

06:50.378 --> 06:53.214
Oh, sure... Sure.

07:00.763 --> 07:03.432
Do you always make the girls cry?

07:03.558 --> 07:04.850
Always.

07:06.185 --> 07:07.520
Just relax.

07:07.645 --> 07:08.646
OK.

08:17.465 --> 08:18.799
Hey, Virgil.

08:18.925 --> 08:21.135
- Virgil!
- Caroline! You look good.

08:21.260 --> 08:25.264
Oh, thank you. What a compliment!
See you tomorrow.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.060
Hey, Virgil!

08:30.269 --> 08:33.313
Can I take your bag?
I'll meet you in the lobby.

08:33.438 --> 08:36.859
Hey! Virgil!

08:37.943 --> 08:40.071
- Hi!
- Hi.

08:40.196 --> 08:41.864
It's... Amy...

08:41.989 --> 08:44.033
- Amy Benic.
- Oh. Yeah.

08:44.158 --> 08:46.035
I didn't recognise you
with your clothes on.

08:47.203 --> 08:50.915
You fell asleep,
so I thought it best if I just left.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.084
Oh, thank you.

08:53.918 --> 08:57.797
My God, you're the skater.
I saw you... last night driving in.

08:57.922 --> 08:58.923
Really?

08:59.048 --> 09:02.093
Yeah! You're good with that stick.
Are you on a team?

09:02.218 --> 09:04.845
Are you a hockey fan?

09:04.971 --> 09:08.975
I don't know. I don't really know
much about it, but it looks like fun.

09:09.100 --> 09:11.811
I skated as a kid,
but I've got two left feet.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.023
Well, this is my ride.

09:18.109 --> 09:19.110
Tommy?

09:19.777 --> 09:22.071
Hey, Virge.

09:24.073 --> 09:27.702
I just wanted to apologise
for falling apart like that.

09:27.827 --> 09:31.038
Um, I was just in a weird place. Sorry.

09:31.163 --> 09:34.500
- And now?
- Now I'm feeling good.

09:34.625 --> 09:36.794
So I wanted to thank you.

09:36.919 --> 09:41.090
- For making you cry?
- No. I made me cry.

09:41.215 --> 09:43.801
But you were very kind to me. Thank you.

09:43.926 --> 09:46.470
Virgil! Virgil, let's move it.

09:46.596 --> 09:49.807
I'm gonna see you tomorrow.
I booked another massage.

09:49.932 --> 09:52.727
- OK. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Nice to see you.

09:52.852 --> 09:55.521
OK. All right.

09:57.690 --> 09:59.734
See you.

10:00.151 --> 10:01.277
Oh, my God.

10:02.528 --> 10:04.488
What?

10:04.614 --> 10:07.491
I'm sorry. I didn't... realise...

10:08.326 --> 10:09.410
Wow.

10:09.535 --> 10:12.663
- Hey, you already apologized once.
- Oh, God.

10:12.788 --> 10:17.293
- No need to overdo it.
- OK. I'll see you tomorrow.

10:17.418 --> 10:19.378
See you tomorrow.

10:19.503 --> 10:20.588
Bye.

10:55.873 --> 10:58.084
Jessie, get off the bed.

11:00.628 --> 11:04.048
There you are. Come here, boy.

11:04.173 --> 11:07.969
You're more like a sleeping-eye dog
than a Seeing Eye dog.

11:08.094 --> 11:12.265
Come here, you. Come on.

11:12.390 --> 11:14.809
There's a game on.

11:14.934 --> 11:16.978
Come on.

11:17.478 --> 11:21.023
Hey, I met a girl today.

11:21.148 --> 11:25.361
- She had an amazing voice. It was
- A charade sheet. OK!

11:25.486 --> 11:28.114
smooth like butter.

11:28.239 --> 11:32.118
And she smelled like...
cinnamon and nutmeg.

11:32.243 --> 11:35.955
Sounds more like a recipe
for a coffee cake than a girl.

11:36.455 --> 11:39.959
You're here! I didn't hear you.

11:40.751 --> 11:44.964
As this game starts, Sundstrom
goes for the puck. Winds it around.

11:45.089 --> 11:48.050
- So, how are the kids?
- Oh, the usual.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.553
They need a lot of attention. Here.

11:52.972 --> 11:56.642
- So, who's the girl?
- Oh, just a spa girl. Client.

11:58.144 --> 12:00.146
Gone in a week.

12:00.271 --> 12:05.026
Look, if you like coffee cake that much,
we can sprinkle cinnamon on Jessie.

12:05.151 --> 12:08.654
- Too old for me.
- Who? Jessie or the girl?

12:08.779 --> 12:11.073
Not jealous of a coffee cake, are you?

12:12.074 --> 12:14.702
- Coke?
- I'm fine.

12:14.827 --> 12:16.787
Your lunch is ready.

12:16.913 --> 12:21.626
- Chicken's at 3 o'clock.
- Rice is at 6 o'clock. Beans are at 9,...

12:21.751 --> 12:25.171
- ..and the news is at 1 1 .
- One day, I'm gonna switch 'em.

12:25.296 --> 12:29.800
Yeah. And one day I'll play forward
for the New York Rangers.

12:30.885 --> 12:33.930
- You need better jokes.
- Or a new sister.

12:34.055 --> 12:36.599
Mm, I'd work on the jokes if I were you.

12:37.808 --> 12:40.102
Aren't you gonna watch some hockey?

12:40.228 --> 12:44.148
You want to grade some spelling tests?
I'm next door if you need me.

12:44.273 --> 12:46.359
OK. Thanks a lot.

12:47.944 --> 12:49.987
So, this girl...

12:50.363 --> 12:53.157
We talked for a long time at the bus stop.

12:55.284 --> 12:57.328
She thought I could see.

13:00.998 --> 13:03.000
I really love coffee cake.

13:35.199 --> 13:38.703
Oh! Oh! Whoa! Oh!

13:38.828 --> 13:40.871
Oh, shoot.

13:44.834 --> 13:46.919
Coming, coming!

13:47.044 --> 13:49.797
Hang on! Hang on. OK.

13:52.174 --> 13:53.968
Coming!

13:55.678 --> 13:58.097
- Hi.
- Oh, my God. Hi.

13:58.222 --> 13:59.974
My turn to apologise.

14:00.099 --> 14:03.394
- I should have told you I was blind.
- Well,

14:04.020 --> 14:07.607
we're even.
Apologies cancel each other out.

14:07.732 --> 14:12.153
You wanna come in? Sorry. I just got out
of the shower. I have to change.

14:12.278 --> 14:14.322
Promise I won't look.

14:14.780 --> 14:16.824
Uh-huh!

14:19.160 --> 14:23.456
Uh... I sort of spilled
some stuff on the floor.

14:23.623 --> 14:28.878
Here, why don't you sit down on the bed?
I'm just gonna go change. Be right back.

14:29.754 --> 14:31.797
All right.

14:32.215 --> 14:35.968
You didn't have to come all the way
back up here just to apologise.

14:36.093 --> 14:39.889
- I was in the neighbourhood.
- You were in the neighbourhood?

14:40.014 --> 14:42.016
Oh, all right, I'll confess.

14:42.141 --> 14:47.855
I was watching hockey with my dog,
and, um... I was describing you.

14:47.980 --> 14:49.565
What?

14:49.690 --> 14:55.571
I was describing how great you smelled.
My sister thought I was describing a cake.

14:55.696 --> 14:58.115
Anyway, I started thinking of you here

14:58.241 --> 15:02.286
in the midst of your tofu shake
and really boring yoghurt.

15:02.411 --> 15:06.249
I thought maybe you'd want to
get some air, take a walk around town.

15:07.250 --> 15:11.003
- Just see what we see.
- See what we see?

15:11.128 --> 15:15.132
- Figure of speech.
- You mean, right here, right now?

15:15.925 --> 15:19.387
- Great! I'm blind and you're deaf.
- What a pair.

15:20.555 --> 15:22.431
52 lampposts... Pinecrest.

15:22.557 --> 15:25.851
Up here on our left
is my sister Jennie's school.

15:26.686 --> 15:29.522
She's really great with these kids.

15:29.647 --> 15:32.275
You see that guy across the street?

15:32.400 --> 15:34.986
- Over in the doorway.
- Uh...

15:35.111 --> 15:37.697
- He's chain-smoking, right?
- Oh, yeah!

15:37.822 --> 15:41.909
That's Bruce. We watch
the game together sometimes.

15:43.452 --> 15:47.832
Here comes Nancy. She's the librarian.
Gets me any book I want in Braille.

15:47.957 --> 15:51.627
- Hey, Nancy!
- Hey, Virgil! I got that book in for you.

15:51.752 --> 15:54.505
Still haven't got that old jalopy fixed.

15:54.630 --> 15:57.383
If I got it fixed,
how would you know it was me?

15:57.508 --> 15:58.467
Hi.

15:58.593 --> 16:02.513
- Nancy, this is Amy. Amy, Nancy.
- Hi, Amy. Nice to meet you.

16:02.638 --> 16:05.600
- Have fun.
- Be careful, honey. He's all hands.

16:05.725 --> 16:07.768
- Be nice.
- Yeah!

16:10.313 --> 16:14.317
Nice town you have here.
You're very popular with the ladies.

16:14.442 --> 16:17.445
Oh, yeah. Moved here when I was eight.

16:17.570 --> 16:20.615
They figured it was a good place
for me to grow up in.

16:20.740 --> 16:23.451
It's a bit geriatric, but... it works.

16:25.536 --> 16:28.581
Do you mind me asking
how long you've been blind?

16:28.706 --> 16:30.666
No, not at all.

16:30.791 --> 16:35.922
It started when I was one.
Completely gone by the time I was three.

16:36.047 --> 16:38.007
Congenital cataracts,

16:38.132 --> 16:42.345
with a dose of retinitis pigmentosa
thrown in for good measure.

16:42.470 --> 16:43.221
Huh.

16:43.346 --> 16:47.225
So... So, you see no bright lights?

16:47.350 --> 16:48.267
Nothing?

16:48.392 --> 16:50.353
Nope. Blind as a bat.

16:50.478 --> 16:55.149
Actually, blinder. Um, bats emit sonar.
I wish I had that sonar.

16:55.274 --> 16:58.236
I don't have a sixth sense. Or a fifth one.

16:58.361 --> 17:00.696
Never wrote a book like Helen Keller.

17:00.821 --> 17:03.366
Wish I could play the piano
like Ray Charles.

17:03.491 --> 17:07.203
I really wish I could sing
like Stevie Wonder. But I can't.

17:07.328 --> 17:10.330
Got it. Huh.

17:12.750 --> 17:18.673
So, what do you, uh, think,
of our, uh, little Sleepy Hollow?

17:19.549 --> 17:23.719
It has a very nice feel to it.
Genuine lines, good use of space.

17:23.844 --> 17:28.724
I'd do something more stimulating with
the newer buildings, but that's just me.

17:28.849 --> 17:30.476
Wow!

17:30.726 --> 17:34.355
What's you?
Are you a writer for Architectural Digest?

17:34.480 --> 17:36.941
Um, no, I'm actually an architect.

17:37.066 --> 17:40.069
That's what I do.
I have a partnership in New York.

17:40.194 --> 17:41.988
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:42.113 --> 17:43.573
Wow.

17:44.991 --> 17:47.034
Well...

17:47.535 --> 17:49.537
This is the end.

17:49.662 --> 17:51.622
Guess we should go back.

17:51.747 --> 17:55.209
Well, what's out there,
past the end of the street?

17:56.294 --> 17:58.337
Nothing.

18:00.298 --> 18:04.343
Well, there is a, um,
old run-down building off to the left.

18:04.468 --> 18:07.013
Kind of like an old gas station.

18:09.056 --> 18:11.100
Would you describe it to me?

18:11.475 --> 18:13.269
OK.

18:13.394 --> 18:16.439
Um... It's kind of dilapidated

18:16.564 --> 18:21.235
and it's sitting in between
two great big trees in a field.

18:21.360 --> 18:25.865
The trees are like a man and a woman.
The man is asking the woman to dance.

18:25.990 --> 18:30.244
And the woman is... on her toes,
trying to decide if she's got the guts.

18:31.913 --> 18:35.207
Oh, God, I'm an idiot.
What a stupid description!

18:35.333 --> 18:37.126
No.

18:37.835 --> 18:40.671
I really like the... dancing trees.

18:44.467 --> 18:47.386
We better get going. It's starting to rain.

18:47.511 --> 18:50.223
Well, there's a little breeze, but l...

18:50.848 --> 18:53.017
Oh, my God.

18:53.142 --> 18:55.019
OK. Oh, my God!

18:55.144 --> 18:57.271
Uh, OK. Wait, let's go this way.

19:04.362 --> 19:06.739
Oh... Oh, my.

19:07.865 --> 19:10.326
I can't believe how fast that happens.

19:10.451 --> 19:14.538
- Oh, do you like the rain? I love the rain.
- Well, sometimes.

19:14.664 --> 19:16.707
I love the rain.

19:18.876 --> 19:23.047
Oh, I feel everything at once.

19:23.172 --> 19:27.093
It's the best way for me
to understand dimension in a room.

19:27.218 --> 19:28.636
Do you hear it?

19:28.761 --> 19:32.640
Coming down off the ceiling,
all the walls?

19:33.933 --> 19:35.518
Do you hear that?

19:36.602 --> 19:38.479
It's hitting a puddle.

19:38.604 --> 19:42.066
It's echoing the sound across.
There's no walls.

19:44.110 --> 19:47.989
What's that? Oh, a drainpipe.

19:48.114 --> 19:50.908
You hear that? That's high up.

19:51.033 --> 19:52.493
Rafters?

19:52.618 --> 19:53.619
Yeah.

19:56.872 --> 20:01.586
It's got its own rhythm. You hear that?
Ping, ping, ping, ping, ping.

20:01.794 --> 20:04.714
And that... that sound way up.

20:06.340 --> 20:08.718
Uh, well, it looks like there's...

20:08.843 --> 20:13.723
No, no, just listen. No, come here.
Close your eyes.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.643
Listen with your whole body.

20:20.688 --> 20:24.400
Feel it? Right in your chest.

20:24.525 --> 20:27.987
Oh, that's beautiful, that, uh,

20:28.112 --> 20:31.782
that little sound like a... like a whisper.

20:31.908 --> 20:33.868
Mm.

20:33.993 --> 20:37.914
It's the wind blowing a branch
across the windows.

20:42.001 --> 20:44.503
I can feel everything when it rains.

20:44.629 --> 20:46.505
I wish it would rain inside.

20:46.839 --> 20:48.883
Rain all around us.

20:51.052 --> 20:53.262
Einfühlung.

20:53.387 --> 20:57.934
- What's that?
- It's an architectural term.

20:58.059 --> 21:01.646
It means... to share a feeling.

21:04.398 --> 21:07.693
I-l don't think I've ever felt like this before.

21:23.543 --> 21:26.671
I wanted you to know I was smiling.

21:52.363 --> 21:55.283
Virgil, before you lost your sight,

21:56.826 --> 21:59.870
do you remember...
seeing anything at all?

22:00.288 --> 22:02.957
I do. One memory.

22:05.501 --> 22:07.879
People say it's the clouds.

22:09.171 --> 22:11.215
But I don't think it was.

22:12.008 --> 22:14.051
Cos I could touch it.

22:15.553 --> 22:17.054
It was a

22:17.847 --> 22:19.891
puffy thing.

22:20.558 --> 22:22.518
Must've been important.

22:22.643 --> 22:24.854
It's a good memory.

22:26.564 --> 22:28.900
I remembered it all these years.

22:29.984 --> 22:32.528
How 'bout you? What...

22:32.653 --> 22:34.447
What's your first memory?

22:35.948 --> 22:36.949
OK.

22:38.910 --> 22:39.911
Um...

22:43.456 --> 22:46.459
I was two, or maybe three.

22:49.670 --> 22:53.007
And I remember being at the beach
with my parents.

22:54.383 --> 22:56.427
It was cold outside.

22:56.761 --> 23:02.600
So, I had to snuggle down
between the both of them in the sand.

23:03.392 --> 23:06.562
And we all watched
the sun set over the horizon.

23:06.729 --> 23:08.773
Horizon. That's a tough one.

23:09.315 --> 23:12.777
I can't feel it. I don't know what it is.

23:12.902 --> 23:15.863
It's the line
where the earth meets the sky.

23:17.740 --> 23:19.784
It's the end of the world.

23:20.368 --> 23:23.037
When I was a kid, l-l used to think

23:23.162 --> 23:26.499
that if I walked far enough,
I could actually reach it.

23:26.624 --> 23:29.252
I thought that if I could,

23:29.377 --> 23:32.046
if I could stand on it

23:32.797 --> 23:35.675
and just look out over the edge,

23:36.133 --> 23:39.929
that I would be able to see
something more beautiful

23:40.054 --> 23:42.848
than anything I had ever known.

23:43.432 --> 23:49.522
No-one's ever explained horizon
to me before so I could understand it.

24:04.912 --> 24:08.541
- You're very good at what you do.
- It's what I do.

24:08.666 --> 24:12.295
- It's what I can do.
- Do you enjoy it?

24:13.504 --> 24:15.548
Sometimes I enjoy it.

24:16.215 --> 24:18.885
Some times more than others.

24:20.261 --> 24:22.805
And this time?

24:22.930 --> 24:24.849
This time...

24:26.100 --> 24:32.690
This time I feel like I can... see everything.

24:32.815 --> 24:33.816
Everything?

24:37.862 --> 24:38.946
Time's up.

24:41.365 --> 24:43.576
And I've got Mr. Ketchum.

24:43.701 --> 24:45.912
All 200lbs of him.

24:46.037 --> 24:49.999
- I felt like we were just getting started.
- Yeah.

24:50.124 --> 24:52.168
Me, too.

24:56.339 --> 24:57.340
Amy?

25:01.344 --> 25:03.846
Cos... you're a client,

25:03.971 --> 25:07.016
I'm not supposed to get that close to you.

25:07.391 --> 25:09.435
You're not?

25:09.894 --> 25:12.480
So, what does that mean?

25:12.605 --> 25:17.360
It means you have to stop paying me,
and come over to my house for dinner

25:17.485 --> 25:19.737
so we can finish the massage.

25:33.334 --> 25:34.502
Hello?

25:34.627 --> 25:37.338
- Hi, Virgil, it's Amy.
- Amy, hey!

25:37.463 --> 25:39.966
You're in for a real surprise. I'm cooking.

25:40.091 --> 25:42.260
So, what time are you coming over?

25:42.385 --> 25:43.386
Virgil,

25:43.511 --> 25:47.014
I can't come. I'm so sorry.
I'm calling from the road.

25:47.139 --> 25:50.434
I have to go back into the city.
An emergency's come up.

25:50.560 --> 25:53.145
This project that I'm in charge of

25:53.271 --> 25:56.816
is going down the drain
and... I gotta go back in and save it.

25:56.941 --> 25:59.068
I'm... Goddamn, I'm sorry.

25:59.193 --> 26:01.195
- But I'm gonna come back, OK?
- OK.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.489
- I feel terrible, but...
- Bye.

26:03.614 --> 26:05.658
OK. Bye.

26:14.959 --> 26:17.003
Stupid!

26:17.461 --> 26:20.882
You're right, Mr. Falk.
Something is missing.

26:21.007 --> 26:25.428
We realise that now.
We just need time to find out what.

26:25.553 --> 26:28.890
Fine, but y'all know
the schedule we're on.

26:29.015 --> 26:32.268
We will take care of it.
We won't let you down.

26:34.228 --> 26:36.188
OK, all right.

26:36.314 --> 26:40.902
Just don't... don't say it. I know you were
never happy with the design anyways.

26:41.027 --> 26:42.987
I wasn't gonna say it.

26:43.112 --> 26:47.074
Yeah, but you'd have tinkered with it
till it went away, right?

26:47.199 --> 26:49.493
You know what this means to us.

26:49.619 --> 26:52.496
I know. I know the whole speech.

26:52.622 --> 26:54.665
Good. Then, I won't have to make it.

26:54.790 --> 26:58.127
Now the guy's hooked,
you've got your second chance.

26:58.252 --> 27:02.089
By the way,
we all deserve a second chance.

27:02.215 --> 27:03.841
OK.

27:03.966 --> 27:06.135
Now, see these two trees?

27:06.344 --> 27:09.513
It's time to give them a second chance.
They'll stay.

27:09.639 --> 27:14.435
We'll design everything around them.
They are the most beautiful thing there.

27:14.560 --> 27:19.232
And, in the car, I thought of
an addition for the Tribeca lobby.

27:19.357 --> 27:23.903
- It'll add so much life to the place.
- Uh, so what's... going on here?

27:24.028 --> 27:26.739
We sent off Hydra,
the three-headed monster.

27:26.864 --> 27:29.325
We get back Mary Poppins in return?

27:29.450 --> 27:32.286
What, I can't have a couple of ideas?

27:34.205 --> 27:37.959
OK, OK. You know, I had my little trip.

27:38.084 --> 27:42.547
I rested, I exercised.
Thank you very much, Betsy.

27:42.672 --> 27:45.299
And, uh,

27:45.424 --> 27:47.468
I met a guy.

27:49.178 --> 27:51.847
- This is too modern for me.
- Come on, Betsy!

27:51.973 --> 27:54.559
We're all friends. Sit down, sit down,

27:55.309 --> 27:57.562
or you'll be fired.

27:58.145 --> 28:00.106
You met a guy? That's...

28:00.231 --> 28:03.067
- That's great. Great... Super...
- Thank you.

28:03.192 --> 28:05.444
So, uh, spill the beans.

28:05.570 --> 28:09.282
Nothing to spill, you know.
He's a great guy. He's smart,

28:09.407 --> 28:11.075
funny,

28:11.200 --> 28:12.410
blind.

28:13.327 --> 28:16.455
Oh, I thought you said he was blind.
Uh, he was blond?

28:16.581 --> 28:18.124
That, too.

28:21.544 --> 28:25.506
I'm sorry. That's fun... Uh, blind blind?

28:25.631 --> 28:31.220
Like... like... white cane,
tap, tap, tap blind? Come on!

28:31.345 --> 28:34.640
I know you like a challenge.
Hell, you married me, but...

28:34.765 --> 28:37.143
OK. Thank you
for your understanding, sir.

28:37.268 --> 28:40.229
OK. It's not... my problem any more.

28:40.354 --> 28:42.815
Duncan, don't be a jerk.

28:42.940 --> 28:44.233
You still work here?

28:52.033 --> 28:54.827
Everyone's gone for the day.

28:54.952 --> 28:59.040
That's OK. I'm just gonna work here
a little bit longer.

28:59.165 --> 29:01.209
Just doing something.

29:10.051 --> 29:10.968
What?

29:11.093 --> 29:15.431
I just want to know more about the guy.
Is that so wrong?

29:15.556 --> 29:19.310
Listen, my father had severe cataracts
a few years back.

29:20.311 --> 29:23.439
Do you have any idea
what you're getting into?

29:26.150 --> 29:31.364
Have you ever listened to the rain?
I mean, really listened?

29:31.906 --> 29:35.201
This... like that smell-the-roses thing?

29:35.326 --> 29:37.370
No, it is not.

29:38.079 --> 29:42.416
Betsy, I've... for the past five years,

29:42.542 --> 29:46.087
lived with a man who has
the emotional content of a soap dish.

29:46.212 --> 29:48.589
The only time I ever saw him cry

29:48.714 --> 29:52.385
was when he was doing
our tax returns three years ago.

29:52.510 --> 29:54.303
I need more than that.

29:54.428 --> 29:58.099
And there's something about this guy...

29:59.350 --> 30:04.105
He makes me feel like I'm... I'm waking up
after being asleep for a long time.

30:04.230 --> 30:07.441
I mean, I'm inspired again.
I can draw again.

30:08.484 --> 30:11.988
And... the way that he touches me...

30:13.447 --> 30:15.324
Oh... Here we go, it's the sex.

30:15.449 --> 30:18.077
No, no! No sex. Not yet!

30:18.202 --> 30:19.537
No...

30:20.454 --> 30:26.377
It's just that when... when he touches me,
I feel like he does it... to know me better,

30:26.544 --> 30:28.921
not to get something from me.

30:29.046 --> 30:31.757
And when he listens to me,

30:31.883 --> 30:35.761
it's as though my words
are the last sounds on the planet.

30:35.887 --> 30:38.973
And even though
he doesn't know what I look like,

30:39.098 --> 30:41.767
I feel like he really knows who I am.

30:43.644 --> 30:46.355
He just moves me, that's all.

30:47.899 --> 30:49.567
Does he have a brother?

31:03.873 --> 31:06.334
Whoo! Wayne Gretzky, look out!

31:06.459 --> 31:08.669
Amy?

31:09.420 --> 31:11.297
How long have you been here?

31:12.506 --> 31:13.674
About an hour.

31:15.218 --> 31:18.179
No. I went up to the lodge
and you weren't there.

31:18.304 --> 31:20.806
So, I guessed, and here you are.

31:22.308 --> 31:24.852
- You're really good at that.
- Thanks.

31:24.977 --> 31:27.188
My dad taught me.

31:28.314 --> 31:30.983
So, how do you like my pond?

31:31.317 --> 31:33.361
It's beautiful.

31:35.905 --> 31:39.116
I'm so surprised you're here.
You want to go skating?

31:39.242 --> 31:40.910
I didn't bring any skates.

31:41.035 --> 31:44.330
- Come on. It's all right.
- Wait, what do you mean?

31:44.455 --> 31:47.833
- Uh, this is ice. I don't have any skates.
- Come on.

31:48.501 --> 31:51.170
I used to take my sister Jennie out
like this.

31:51.295 --> 31:54.006
Take my stick.
Put it over there on that branch.

31:54.549 --> 31:55.550
OK.

31:58.469 --> 32:00.846
- Yeah? Ready?
- Uh...

32:00.972 --> 32:05.184
Now, don't think about skating.
Think about gliding.

32:05.309 --> 32:09.105
So, uh, don't think about the ice.
Don't look down.

32:09.230 --> 32:13.734
Take your mind off it. Tell me,
how did you become an architect?

32:13.859 --> 32:14.860
OK.

32:14.986 --> 32:19.115
I was in art school in college and...

32:19.240 --> 32:21.492
- Aaaah...
- Don't look down.

32:21.617 --> 32:24.871
I didn't know what I was
going to do with myself.

32:24.996 --> 32:30.459
And then I met this guy who was
an architectural grad student.

32:31.127 --> 32:33.880
And he opened up
this whole new world for me.

32:34.005 --> 32:36.048
Don't look down.

32:36.173 --> 32:40.803
So, me and the grad student
got married and

32:40.928 --> 32:45.766
we started a company... Oh, sorry.
But we're divorced now. It's OK.

32:45.892 --> 32:48.686
Uh, we got divorced about a year ago.

32:48.853 --> 32:53.065
But we're still working together,
which is kinda crazy...

32:53.190 --> 32:55.610
What? Um, wait. Oh!

32:55.735 --> 32:57.778
Whoa!

32:57.904 --> 33:00.323
- You OK?
- Yeah.

33:00.781 --> 33:01.866
Yeah.

33:09.540 --> 33:11.500
Did you think I meant to do that?

33:11.626 --> 33:14.712
Yeah. Did you?

33:15.046 --> 33:16.756
Yeah.

33:20.593 --> 33:22.887
Oh, God, this is so hard.

33:23.638 --> 33:24.764
What?

33:24.889 --> 33:27.183
Um, well,

33:27.308 --> 33:31.979
I'm looking at you, right?
And there's this, uh,...

33:32.104 --> 33:35.066
..there's this... thing I do with my eyes,

33:35.191 --> 33:38.361
when I'm glancing out
from under my eyelashes

33:38.486 --> 33:40.821
and sort of giving you this sexy look.

33:40.947 --> 33:44.700
And then I realise it doesn't matter to you.

33:44.825 --> 33:46.869
No, it doesn't matter.

33:49.121 --> 33:50.456
Let me see.

33:57.338 --> 33:59.382
Eyes.

34:01.801 --> 34:03.844
Nose.

34:05.513 --> 34:07.557
Mouth.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.437
You're very beautiful.

34:14.938 --> 34:17.817
Thank you. So are you.

- Hello?
- Hi, I'm in the bathroom.

36:26.946 --> 36:28.698
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

36:28.823 --> 36:31.534
Um... I'm Jennie, Virgil's sister.

36:31.659 --> 36:33.828
Hi, I'm Amy Benic.

36:34.829 --> 36:37.456
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.752
- Hi.
- Hi. Here, here.

36:42.712 --> 36:46.966
So, I was at the market before school,
and I thought you might like...

36:47.091 --> 36:49.677
Apples... and bananas.

36:49.802 --> 36:52.346
He's a show-off.
He smells 'em a mile away.

36:52.471 --> 36:56.350
- The apples are on the bottom shelf.
- Two o'clock, I know. Thanks.

36:56.475 --> 36:59.395
Do you, uh... Do you want some coffee?

36:59.520 --> 37:00.980
OK.

37:01.105 --> 37:02.982
Amy, how long are you in town?

37:03.107 --> 37:04.150
Argh!

37:04.275 --> 37:06.861
- You OK?
- Yeah! I'm fine.

37:06.986 --> 37:08.195
You're bleeding!

37:08.321 --> 37:12.658
The first thing with a blind man is -
don't change anything. It's too dangerous.

37:12.783 --> 37:14.368
Jennie...

37:14.493 --> 37:17.496
Listen, it's OK...
Goddammit, I said I'm OK!

37:17.622 --> 37:20.458
It's just a chair. It happens to everybody.

37:21.083 --> 37:22.168
Really.

37:22.293 --> 37:26.255
I've got parent meetings tonight.
Your dinner's in the freezer.

37:26.380 --> 37:28.007
It's in the lower corner.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.469
It's nice to have met you, Amy.

37:31.594 --> 37:34.680
- You, too, Jennie.
- Thanks.

37:37.808 --> 37:40.519
Well, she's just being an older sister.

37:40.770 --> 37:44.273
She's just being jealous.
Do you want some coffee?

37:44.398 --> 37:46.442
- Yeah
- OK.

38:32.738 --> 38:33.739
Hey!

38:35.491 --> 38:36.826
- Virgil.
- Hi.

38:36.951 --> 38:37.785
Hey.

38:37.910 --> 38:41.914
I've been looking all over for you.
I have some great news.

38:42.039 --> 38:46.252
- That Atlanta project of yours?
- Oh, no, something much better.

38:47.295 --> 38:49.505
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

38:49.630 --> 38:52.049
I'm all ears.

38:55.136 --> 38:57.179
- Hi.
- Hey.

38:58.598 --> 39:00.474
- Let me catch my breath.
- OK.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.435
All right.

39:02.727 --> 39:03.728
OK.

39:04.729 --> 39:07.773
Have you ever wondered
what it would be like to see?

39:07.899 --> 39:09.692
Sure.

39:09.817 --> 39:14.155
Like, uh, whether there's, uh,
life on Mars,

39:14.280 --> 39:18.701
or whether or not the... aliens
built the pyramids.

39:19.994 --> 39:22.580
OK, but if there were a chance,

39:22.705 --> 39:27.710
if something could be done
to give you sight, would you take it?

39:28.586 --> 39:32.381
Well... What are we talking about here?

39:35.426 --> 39:38.763
- Um, I saw that article on Doctor Aaron.
- Who?

39:38.888 --> 39:42.683
He's... He's the leading eye surgeon
on the Eastern seaboard.

39:42.808 --> 39:46.604
And I called him up
at Manhattan Eye and Ear.

39:46.729 --> 39:49.315
And I spoke to him about you.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.817
I'm sorry, you... you called this guy?

39:51.943 --> 39:54.111
Yes, and he just faxed me back

39:54.237 --> 39:57.823
and he said that he would be
very excited to see you.

39:57.949 --> 40:01.744
He thinks that in your case
there might be a chance of reversal.

40:01.869 --> 40:03.871
What do you think?

40:05.998 --> 40:08.543
I guess I'm, uh...

40:08.668 --> 40:12.171
I forgot that it's
Help the Handicapped Week.

40:12.588 --> 40:15.841
I... I thought you'd be excited.
What's the problem?

40:15.967 --> 40:19.804
That's the point, Amy.
There is no goddamn problem.

40:25.434 --> 40:27.436
- Hi.
- Hi, Jennie.

40:27.562 --> 40:29.772
You did great work today.

40:29.897 --> 40:32.191
- See you tomorrow.
- OK, thanks.

40:32.316 --> 40:34.443
- Hi.
- Amy, right?

40:34.569 --> 40:37.572
Right.
Um, could I speak to you for a minute?

40:37.697 --> 40:41.242
- Yeah. Something wrong?
- There's something I don't understand.

40:41.367 --> 40:44.704
I saw that article on Dr Aaron
and I called him.

40:44.829 --> 40:47.206
- He's willing to see Virgil.
- Bye, Jennie.

40:47.331 --> 40:48.875
In fact, he's anxious to see him.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.836
But when I told Virgil
he acted as if I was trying to...

40:51.961 --> 40:54.839
What don't you understand?

40:54.964 --> 40:57.842
Well, if I had spent
nearly all my life blind,

40:57.967 --> 41:02.054
and there was the remotest possibility
that I could regain my sight,

41:02.179 --> 41:03.723
I would be all over that.

41:03.848 --> 41:06.684
When there's something
you've adapted to,

41:06.809 --> 41:10.021
you'd change it
without knowing the consequences?

41:11.606 --> 41:13.065
Oh...

41:13.190 --> 41:17.320
We're very happy here, Amy.
Virgil has everything he needs.

41:21.532 --> 41:22.992
Wait.

41:23.117 --> 41:25.328
Everything that he needs?

41:25.453 --> 41:30.291
Does he need to go through life blind
if there's a possibility that he could see?

41:30.416 --> 41:33.794
I would give him my eyes
if it would help him see. But it won't.

41:33.920 --> 41:36.797
I learned a long time ago
to stop believing in miracles.

41:36.923 --> 41:40.426
- I see where you're coming from.
- Yes, you do. And Virgil doesn't.

41:40.551 --> 41:42.303
Why can't you accept that?

41:42.428 --> 41:44.597
He spent his first eight years

41:45.014 --> 41:49.477
having his eyes probed, pierced,
prodded, poked at by doctors,

41:49.602 --> 41:52.396
faith healers, spiritualists, medicine men.

41:52.521 --> 41:56.776
My father lined them up outside the door.
It hurt and disappointed all of us.

41:56.901 --> 41:58.486
And it almost killed him.

41:58.611 --> 42:01.072
He doesn't need to go through that again.

42:01.197 --> 42:04.325
So, now maybe you understand.

42:08.788 --> 42:10.373
He gets it out to...

42:10.498 --> 42:12.792
No, no, no!

42:12.917 --> 42:15.753
I can't believe you guys
are doing this to me!

42:15.878 --> 42:17.672
I can kick better than you guys!

42:17.797 --> 42:19.549
What? Virgil!

42:21.050 --> 42:22.134
Amy?

42:22.260 --> 42:23.511
Hey.

42:25.137 --> 42:30.184
Hi, Amy. Just a... Ranger game.

42:33.354 --> 42:36.315
- Are they losing?
- Well, no, I'd, uh,

42:36.440 --> 42:40.111
prefer to think of it as not winning.

42:40.236 --> 42:42.572
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:42.697 --> 42:45.741
Do you want to, uh, come in?

42:45.867 --> 42:48.369
Get a Coke or, um, beer or something?

42:48.494 --> 42:50.746
No, I'm fine. I just, uh...

42:50.872 --> 42:55.209
I just wanted to come to see you
before I had to go back to the city.

42:55.334 --> 42:58.379
Oh! Spa days are over?

42:59.463 --> 43:02.675
- I've got to go back to work.
- Mm-hm.

43:03.175 --> 43:07.889
I wanted to apologise for stomping around
in your life like Big Foot today.

43:08.014 --> 43:10.141
It... wasn't my place. I'm sorry.

43:10.266 --> 43:12.560
Here. Here.

43:14.228 --> 43:18.482
See, um... See the tree over there?
Across the drive?

43:19.692 --> 43:21.193
Yeah.

43:21.819 --> 43:26.198
- How far away is it?
- Guessing, about 25ft.

43:26.324 --> 43:31.579
Mm, to you maybe.
But to me, it's 14 steps.

43:31.704 --> 43:36.000
14 steps and I get to the tree.
But if I think about something else,

43:36.125 --> 43:42.465
if I go too slow, or if I rush,
then l... smash right into it.

43:48.262 --> 43:49.180
OK.

43:49.305 --> 43:54.685
Well, I guess l, you know,
I should go... pack.

43:56.229 --> 44:01.067
Oh, you like smashing into trees?

44:29.804 --> 44:30.805
Amy?

44:32.640 --> 44:35.351
I'm over here.

44:35.476 --> 44:40.022
- I couldn't sleep.
- Well, come back in bed.

45:12.305 --> 45:14.473
I want you to hear one thing.

45:14.682 --> 45:16.517
What?

45:16.642 --> 45:19.353
- That I'm... happy.
- Haven't we been through this enough?

45:19.478 --> 45:23.065
- You're not being fair.
- I don't want to see you get hurt.

45:23.190 --> 45:24.775
- That's your point?
- Yes.

45:24.901 --> 45:28.696
- So, what's your advice?
- I'm worried about you, that's all.

45:28.821 --> 45:31.908
- No, that's not the point.
- Yes, it is the point.

45:32.033 --> 45:34.660
- That's what you're saying.
- No, that's...

45:34.785 --> 45:37.121
- You're acting like a child.
- You are, too.

45:50.259 --> 45:52.678
- Hi.
- Hi. Is everything all right?

45:52.803 --> 45:54.597
Yeah.

45:54.722 --> 45:56.557
No...

45:56.682 --> 45:59.852
I didn't like the feeling last night
of waking up

45:59.977 --> 46:03.189
and... thinking you weren't there.

46:05.608 --> 46:07.652
Let's go to New York.

46:14.450 --> 46:19.038
♪ The way you sip your tea ♪

46:19.163 --> 46:22.917
♪ The memory of all that... ♪

46:24.001 --> 46:28.923
♪ No, no
They can't take that away from me ♪

46:30.925 --> 46:34.637
Honey, it is
the most beautiful New York day.

46:34.762 --> 46:38.307
Crisp and clear. There are
white, puffy clouds above the city.

46:38.432 --> 46:40.184
Maybe like the ones you saw.

46:40.851 --> 46:43.980
No, the ones I saw
I could hold in my hand.

46:44.105 --> 46:45.147
Watch out!

46:45.815 --> 46:46.524
Oh!

46:48.317 --> 46:54.991
♪ They can't take that away from me ♪

46:55.408 --> 46:59.412
The cataracts act like a curtain
across the window of sight.

46:59.537 --> 47:01.581
And if the disease to the retina

47:01.706 --> 47:05.585
is reduced or in check, which is
impossible to know at this point,

47:05.710 --> 47:08.754
but if that is the case,
using this new procedure,

47:08.880 --> 47:12.091
there is a good possibility
we can give you sight.

47:12.216 --> 47:14.302
Sounds expensive.

47:14.677 --> 47:17.471
Well, there's an opportunity
for all of us here.

47:17.597 --> 47:21.934
Not often do we get to restore sight
to someone with extended blindness.

47:22.059 --> 47:25.104
I'm sure we can get the lnstitute
to pick up the bill.

47:25.229 --> 47:30.026
- I've been through all this before.
- Believe me, I know.

47:30.151 --> 47:33.654
But it's nothing as invasive
as what you went through as a child.

47:33.779 --> 47:37.491
I mean, uh, 25 years ago,
cataract surgery was in the Dark Ages.

47:37.617 --> 47:39.660
We've come a long way since then.

47:39.785 --> 47:45.291
And, uh, Dr Goldman here will perform
the surgery. He's one of our best.

47:45.416 --> 47:47.501
What if it doesn't work?

47:47.627 --> 47:52.757
Well, then you'd be
no worse off than you are now.

47:53.299 --> 47:56.093
I mean, basically,
what have you got to lose?

47:58.304 --> 48:00.473
So, this is my place.

48:00.598 --> 48:04.018
There's a great park around the corner.
We're in Tribeca.

48:04.143 --> 48:05.436
- Ho-ho-ho!
- Sorry.

48:05.561 --> 48:10.691
Ethan, watch out.
Hey. This, my friend, is Virgil.

48:10.816 --> 48:13.110
- Virgil, Ethan.
- Ethan.

48:13.569 --> 48:15.696
- Are you blind?
- Yeah.

48:15.821 --> 48:18.324
- Cool. See ya.
- See ya.

48:18.449 --> 48:21.285
- Kids think I'm cool.
- You are.

48:22.245 --> 48:24.914
OK, here we are.

48:26.123 --> 48:28.209
This is my loft.

48:28.334 --> 48:33.172
- Can I put this down here?
- Yeah, anywhere. I'll just get it later.

48:33.297 --> 48:37.385
OK, can I do some blind 101?

48:37.510 --> 48:41.973
You just walk me down the center
and point out all the obstacles.

48:42.098 --> 48:46.310
If you want to move anything,
once you move it, don't move it again.

48:46.435 --> 48:48.813
Otherwise, crash.

48:48.938 --> 48:50.690
OK, got it.

48:50.815 --> 48:54.026
Well, to our right
is the living-room section.

48:54.151 --> 48:58.072
There's a couch and some low tables,
and a chair at two o'clock.

48:58.197 --> 49:05.121
OK, over here at 10, um, there is a post.
And I've hit this many times, so...

49:05.246 --> 49:08.124
Over to the right is...

49:08.249 --> 49:11.085
Whoa, a little further right, the bed.

49:11.210 --> 49:14.338
In front of it is a low table
you could hurt your shin on.

49:14.463 --> 49:17.508
Uh, three o'clock there is a TV.

49:17.633 --> 49:21.804
And this is, uh, my desk here.

49:21.929 --> 49:24.140
I have a computer.

49:24.265 --> 49:28.644
- And, uh, I've got my model here of...
- What's this?

49:29.687 --> 49:32.315
Mm... It's a... sculpture.

49:33.733 --> 49:36.444
- You did it.
- Yeah.

49:36.569 --> 49:39.906
Art school. It's not very good.

49:40.031 --> 49:43.367
It's a mother holding her baby.

49:43.492 --> 49:46.037
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, whatever.

49:46.162 --> 49:48.873
I mean, I can never finish it.

49:48.998 --> 49:52.084
OK, come on.

49:52.752 --> 49:55.338
Then we have reached
the end of the room.

49:55.463 --> 49:58.591
- The wall of windows.
- Hm. Do they open?

49:58.716 --> 49:59.717
Yeah.

50:01.344 --> 50:02.470
Oh, shoot. Oh.

50:02.595 --> 50:03.596
Sorry.

50:06.891 --> 50:09.685
- Sorry about that.
- It's OK.

50:12.730 --> 50:14.148
What are they?

50:14.273 --> 50:17.026
Um, they're my plans.

50:17.235 --> 50:21.531
Designs for jobs I'm working on.
Like the Atlanta mall we're bidding on,

50:21.656 --> 50:25.743
or... I don't know,
we have the Tribeca lobby. It's what I do.

50:27.537 --> 50:30.998
What are the plans? Are they drawings?

50:31.123 --> 50:35.211
Yeah, some of them are drawings.
The one you're touching is a drawing.

50:35.336 --> 50:40.299
Some of them are computer-generated
and blueprints. But I drew this one.

50:50.935 --> 50:54.021
What are you thinking about?

50:56.440 --> 50:59.277
I want to have this operation.

50:59.485 --> 51:01.571
You mean it?

51:06.325 --> 51:07.326
Yes.

51:09.245 --> 51:13.165
I-A map. US hydrosolic.

51:15.668 --> 51:20.298
US stay go. US pulse. US l-A.

51:20.423 --> 51:23.092
Retina looks good.
All right, balance saw.

51:24.969 --> 51:28.306
And the hydrodissection now, please.

51:29.015 --> 51:32.393
- Cortical cleavage.
- Irrigation system.

51:32.518 --> 51:35.146
- First cut.
- I-A map.

51:36.522 --> 51:38.524
Coffee?

51:38.649 --> 51:40.526
Oh, thanks.

51:40.651 --> 51:42.695
It's pretty bad.

51:46.324 --> 51:50.745
So, Virgil never talks about his parents.
Do they know?

51:50.870 --> 51:55.082
Well, our mom died when I was 18
and, uh, Virgil was just a teenager.

51:55.208 --> 51:59.420
And our, uh, father... Well, he left us

51:59.545 --> 52:01.214
quite a while ago.

52:01.339 --> 52:03.925
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

52:07.303 --> 52:09.513
Ugh, you're right, that is bad.

52:11.432 --> 52:15.269
That must have been tough on you,
taking care of him all alone,

52:15.394 --> 52:17.772
after your mom died.

52:17.897 --> 52:19.941
Well, he's my brother.

52:21.943 --> 52:22.818
Ready?

52:23.653 --> 52:26.531
And now the Sinskey hook, please.

52:26.739 --> 52:31.536
- US hydrosolic.
- I can see the optic nerve and the retina.

52:31.661 --> 52:33.704
US pulse.

52:34.330 --> 52:35.540
Patch.

52:35.998 --> 52:38.918
That's it. Let's patch him up, Tracy.
Terrific.

52:45.633 --> 52:48.261
- Hello?
- Virgil, we're here.

52:51.013 --> 52:52.014
Hi.

52:54.767 --> 52:56.811
- Hi.
- How you doing?

52:58.187 --> 53:00.106
How are you feeling?

53:00.690 --> 53:05.820
Well, a bit like a tequila hangover.
But I can't remember the party.

53:05.945 --> 53:08.281
The doctor said that you did great.

53:08.406 --> 53:11.868
- Did it hurt a lot?
- Just the operation.

53:13.202 --> 53:17.790
Hey, how's my hair? I'd hate for
my first seeing day to be a bad hair day.

53:17.915 --> 53:20.251
Looks good.

53:20.376 --> 53:22.753
Who are those, um, people?

53:22.879 --> 53:24.463
There's a camera crew.

53:24.589 --> 53:27.508
For posterity.
We're gonna make you famous here.

53:27.633 --> 53:32.263
We're sending this closed-circuit into
one of our conference rooms. Is that OK?

53:32.388 --> 53:33.055
Sure.

53:33.180 --> 53:38.561
- OK, you ready to get started?
- Yeah. Let's... see what we see.

53:38.686 --> 53:40.730
All right.

53:40.855 --> 53:43.107
You mean right... right now?

53:43.232 --> 53:44.525
OK.

53:44.650 --> 53:47.862
- Is that all right?
- Yeah. I'm just... a little nervous.

53:47.987 --> 53:49.155
OK?

53:49.280 --> 53:53.242
All right, let's start taking the first one off.

53:53.367 --> 53:55.870
This is just the outside.

54:03.753 --> 54:05.504
OK, phase one.

54:07.715 --> 54:11.469
Take off the, uh, right patch.

54:17.934 --> 54:19.769
And the left.

54:21.145 --> 54:22.146
OK.

54:23.397 --> 54:25.441
And there we go.

54:26.567 --> 54:27.610
OK.

54:34.992 --> 54:37.078
So, what do you see?

54:40.373 --> 54:41.999
Oh, my God...

54:50.633 --> 54:52.677
Well, what do you see?

54:53.302 --> 54:54.887
I don't know.

54:55.012 --> 54:57.056
Can you see Amy?

54:57.932 --> 54:59.976
I'm over here, Virgil.

55:03.229 --> 55:04.689
I don't know.

55:07.567 --> 55:11.362
- Can you see your sister?
- Virgil, are you OK? Are you OK?

55:11.487 --> 55:14.407
Oh, God! This isn't right.
Something's wrong.

55:14.532 --> 55:16.325
- What's wrong?
- There's a problem.

55:16.450 --> 55:19.579
- It'll be fine.
- It's not fine. Don't say it's fine!

55:19.704 --> 55:22.331
- This can't be seeing.
- What do you see?

55:23.082 --> 55:25.209
Argh! Oh, that's bad!

55:28.337 --> 55:30.172
Oh, my God!

55:30.298 --> 55:32.216
- Stop moving!
- Get the lights out!

55:32.383 --> 55:34.886
- Get them out of here!
- What can we do?

55:36.470 --> 55:39.515
OK, Virgil, they've gone. Let's calm down.

55:39.640 --> 55:43.269
- OK, all right.
- It's all right, it's OK, they've left.

55:43.394 --> 55:46.856
I gotta think. Something's wrong.
This can't be seeing.

55:46.981 --> 55:48.774
- Come on.
- It's OK, just relax.

55:48.900 --> 55:50.860
OK, I need to think.

55:50.985 --> 55:52.820
What can we do?

55:52.945 --> 55:55.239
Um, give me something in my hands.

55:56.157 --> 55:56.949
OK.

55:58.451 --> 55:59.243
OK.

56:01.621 --> 56:04.832
OK. OK.

56:04.999 --> 56:09.003
Good.
Now, just use your sense of touch.

56:09.128 --> 56:11.964
Just associate now.
What do you see in front of you?

56:12.089 --> 56:13.299
Oh...

56:14.217 --> 56:16.260
Use your touch.

56:16.636 --> 56:18.679
I'm right here, Virgil.

56:39.158 --> 56:40.826
- It's a can.
- Good, good.

56:40.952 --> 56:45.498
- What's going on?
- Associating. His fingers tell his brain,

56:45.623 --> 56:49.752
then his brain tells his eyes.
Then he recognizes what's in front of him.

56:52.880 --> 56:57.635
OK, Virgil, let's, uh,
give your eyes a rest. OK?

56:57.760 --> 57:01.681
We should all be very happy.
We've got something.

57:09.438 --> 57:11.774
With extended blindness...

57:11.899 --> 57:14.694
- Dr, may I speak to you for a moment?
- Sure.

57:14.819 --> 57:18.865
What the hell just happened in there?
ls that what you call seeing?

57:18.990 --> 57:23.411
It's a little complicated.
It is clear that he is seeing.

57:23.536 --> 57:27.248
He's picking up images.
Apparently his retina is intact.

57:27.915 --> 57:31.419
For all intents and purposes,
it's a success.

57:31.544 --> 57:34.964
A success? He's lost.
He can't see me, or his sister.

57:35.089 --> 57:37.133
He can only see a Coke can.

57:37.258 --> 57:40.386
And that's only after he held it.
He could do that before.

57:40.511 --> 57:44.891
Believe me, he can see you.
He just doesn't understand what he sees.

57:46.100 --> 57:51.188
- So, is this temporary? Will this go away?
- Well, there is a visual therapist.

57:51.314 --> 57:54.191
It's a fella named Phil Webster.

57:54.317 --> 57:57.653
He's unorthodox,
but he's probably our best bet,

57:57.778 --> 58:00.698
considering the unique aspects
of this case.

58:00.823 --> 58:04.076
I'll contact him right away.
But there's no guarantees.

58:04.202 --> 58:07.079
- He might be able to help us.
- No guarantee?

58:07.371 --> 58:09.749
Look, we are all on new ground here.

58:10.333 --> 58:12.335
Let's try to be optimistic.

58:12.460 --> 58:14.212
I mean, he can see.

58:27.475 --> 58:29.518
Oh...

58:31.479 --> 58:33.689
Uh... Hello?

58:36.525 --> 58:38.569
Oh...

58:47.662 --> 58:49.539
Oh...

58:58.422 --> 59:00.466
Mm.

59:01.259 --> 59:02.927
Hello?

01:00:21.172 --> 01:00:22.089
Amy?

01:00:24.342 --> 01:00:26.385
No, it's Jen.

01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:28.804
Huh...

01:00:34.894 --> 01:00:35.895
S...

01:00:37.271 --> 01:00:39.315
So this is you.

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:43.194
This is me.

01:00:48.908 --> 01:00:52.662
Everything's gonna be all right,
soon as we can get you home.

01:00:52.787 --> 01:00:55.998
I'm not gonna go home.
I'm gonna stay in New York,

01:00:56.123 --> 01:01:00.294
where the doctors are
and where they can take care of me.

01:01:00.586 --> 01:01:04.632
I can't stay here,
and... you can't go through this alone.

01:01:05.132 --> 01:01:07.385
Who's gonna take care of...

01:01:10.638 --> 01:01:12.682
Amy?

01:01:14.934 --> 01:01:16.978
She's gonna look after you?

01:01:18.604 --> 01:01:20.982
She knows nothing about the blind.

01:01:21.107 --> 01:01:23.776
But I'm not blind any more, Jennie.

01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:26.112
OK.

01:01:26.237 --> 01:01:28.239
- Two weeks.
- No.

01:01:28.364 --> 01:01:30.032
Not one day.

01:01:30.157 --> 01:01:33.369
I'm not...
I'm not gonna do anything to lose her.

01:01:38.875 --> 01:01:40.918
OK.

01:01:47.383 --> 01:01:49.677
Hey.

01:01:49.802 --> 01:01:53.931
- Hey.
- Virgil's finishing getting ready.

01:01:54.056 --> 01:01:56.225
Would you mind walking me to my car?

01:01:56.350 --> 01:02:00.438
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm scared to death.

01:02:02.189 --> 01:02:05.818
I've spent my whole life
looking for holes he might fall in.

01:02:06.652 --> 01:02:09.488
I'd run up ahead and cover 'em up.

01:02:10.406 --> 01:02:13.075
Everywhere I look here, I see holes.

01:02:14.285 --> 01:02:17.914
Well, hopefully
he'll start seeing them for himself.

01:02:18.039 --> 01:02:22.668
Believe me, Jennie, I don't want him
to get hurt any more than you do.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.339
What hurt Virgil the most
was his father leaving.

01:02:27.048 --> 01:02:29.967
He thought it had to do with his blindness.

01:02:30.092 --> 01:02:34.305
That he hadn't tried hard enough.
Or he could have been better.

01:02:35.973 --> 01:02:38.226
I'm not going anywhere, Jennie.

01:02:38.351 --> 01:02:41.062
A blind child can't see
those close to them.

01:02:41.187 --> 01:02:46.192
They never learn how to reach out.
If he's unhappy, or in pain, or confused,

01:02:46.317 --> 01:02:47.985
Virgil won't reach out.

01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:51.447
He goes behind a wall,
a place we can't go to.

01:02:52.406 --> 01:02:56.744
He just needs to have somebody
be there for him when he comes back.

01:02:58.704 --> 01:03:00.706
OK.

01:03:12.843 --> 01:03:13.844
OK.

01:03:15.054 --> 01:03:17.890
Well, this is it, this is home.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.601
Oh, God.

01:03:20.726 --> 01:03:22.812
Whoa. You OK?

01:03:23.312 --> 01:03:25.356
Stop the world, I wanna get off.

01:03:25.481 --> 01:03:27.441
- We'll go slow...
- What's that?

01:03:27.567 --> 01:03:32.488
Wh... Oh, it's a shadow, sweetie.
It's nothing. You can walk through it. See?

01:03:35.741 --> 01:03:37.952
- Hey, Virgil, it's Ethan.
- Hey.

01:03:38.369 --> 01:03:40.621
Are you all right? You look kinda funny.

01:03:40.746 --> 01:03:43.875
You should see
what you look like from here.

01:03:44.667 --> 01:03:48.379
- OK. We're gonna go upstairs now.
- All right. Hey, Zach!

01:03:48.504 --> 01:03:50.548
God, I feel like such a child.

01:03:50.673 --> 01:03:56.178
It's OK. We're gonna find
that Webster guy and get his help, OK?

01:04:00.182 --> 01:04:02.226
Here we go.

01:04:02.852 --> 01:04:05.605
- Keep your eyes closed for one second.
- OK.

01:04:10.526 --> 01:04:11.694
OK.

01:04:11.819 --> 01:04:13.654
Oh...

01:04:13.779 --> 01:04:15.489
Oh, no, I'm sorry, sweetie.

01:04:15.656 --> 01:04:18.159
- No, I wanna see it.
- It's too much.

01:04:20.203 --> 01:04:23.664
- Does this look like this all the time?
- No. Oh, God!

01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:27.710
While we were at the hospital,
I asked Betsy to come over here.

01:04:27.835 --> 01:04:30.504
I wanted to make it special. I'm sorry.

01:04:30.796 --> 01:04:34.008
Oh. Maybe I'd better sit down.
I'm kinda dizzy.

01:04:34.634 --> 01:04:35.635
OK.

01:04:39.305 --> 01:04:42.058
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's great.

01:04:42.183 --> 01:04:45.353
Let me just look at you though.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.564
Can you see me?

01:04:48.689 --> 01:04:49.690
Yes.

01:04:52.777 --> 01:04:54.904
Can I see all of you?

01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:58.074
All of me? Like all of me?

01:04:58.199 --> 01:05:01.285
Oh, God! If you want to.

01:05:01.661 --> 01:05:05.706
I'm so nervous. I can't believe this.
What if you don't like what you see?

01:05:05.831 --> 01:05:07.875
That's impossible.

01:05:09.502 --> 01:05:11.837
I'll close my eyes.

01:05:12.713 --> 01:05:16.676
No. No, no. This is your first seeing day.
You have to see everything.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.143
So, this is what beautiful looks like.

01:06:33.628 --> 01:06:38.883
Right. OK. Virgil, it says here
you went blind as a child,

01:06:39.008 --> 01:06:42.011
before you developed
a visual vocabulary.

01:06:42.136 --> 01:06:44.847
You have a problem with depth of field,

01:06:44.972 --> 01:06:47.308
space, shape, size and distance.

01:06:47.725 --> 01:06:52.730
It's fascinating. There's only been
20 cases of this in the last 200 years.

01:06:52.855 --> 01:06:58.027
Your eyes work, but your brain
hasn't learned to process the information.

01:06:58.152 --> 01:07:02.490
You are mentally blind.
Neurologists call this visual agnosia.

01:07:02.615 --> 01:07:04.951
Well, I call it pretty screwed up.

01:07:05.076 --> 01:07:09.247
That's a much better term.
I'll bring it up at the next meeting.

01:07:09.372 --> 01:07:13.751
It would be difficult to get grant money
for the pretty-screwed-up foundation.

01:07:14.961 --> 01:07:17.880
I have something I'd like to read to you.

01:07:18.005 --> 01:07:21.592
Oh. Rugelach? I made it myself.

01:07:22.885 --> 01:07:24.053
Dammit.

01:07:24.178 --> 01:07:26.556
Uh, my glasses, I can never find 'em.

01:07:26.681 --> 01:07:29.308
Mrs. Fenster! Help!

01:07:32.853 --> 01:07:35.398
Thank you. Happens all the time.

01:07:35.523 --> 01:07:38.276
OK, Alberto Valvo.

01:07:38.401 --> 01:07:42.488
Uh... "Sight Restoration
after Long-term Blindness."

01:07:42.613 --> 01:07:43.906
Ah...

01:07:44.031 --> 01:07:47.994
"One must die as a blind person
to be born again

01:07:48.119 --> 01:07:50.371
as a sighted person."

01:07:50.496 --> 01:07:54.250
"However, it is the interim,
the limbo between two worlds,

01:07:54.375 --> 01:07:55.835
that is so terrible."

01:07:58.087 --> 01:08:01.048
There you go, pal. You're in limbo.

01:08:01.173 --> 01:08:06.053
That... That's it? Limbo? I mean...
That book doesn't have anything else

01:08:06.178 --> 01:08:11.642
- that might help with Virgil's condition?
- Limbo's not so bad. It's like New Jersey.

01:08:11.767 --> 01:08:15.646
You can see where all the good stuff is.
You just have to get there.

01:08:15.771 --> 01:08:19.692
I know, I know,
you were expecting Anne Bancroft.

01:08:19.817 --> 01:08:22.528
A dramatic breakthrough
out by the water pump.

01:08:22.653 --> 01:08:24.697
Sorry, I'm just a professor.

01:08:24.822 --> 01:08:28.326
I teach people how to teach the blind
how to become independent.

01:08:28.451 --> 01:08:32.830
Unfortunately, there's no manual
on what you're going through.

01:08:32.955 --> 01:08:38.044
I'd like to help, but like the rest of things
in life, it's really up to you.

01:08:39.337 --> 01:08:42.590
Are you crazy? I'm completely confused.

01:08:42.715 --> 01:08:46.385
You said you'd like to help,
so we came here for help...

01:08:46.676 --> 01:08:51.140
- All right, all right, you want a lesson?
- Yes!

01:08:51.265 --> 01:08:54.227
Here we go. Lesson number one.

01:08:55.019 --> 01:08:57.063
Repeat after me...

01:08:57.188 --> 01:09:00.024
The rain in Spain stays mainly...

01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:02.944
Look, I'm kidding! It's a joke.

01:09:04.694 --> 01:09:06.697
What's this?

01:09:10.785 --> 01:09:13.287
It's an... It's an apple.

01:09:13.412 --> 01:09:16.874
Good, good.
You've now won the toaster oven.

01:09:17.291 --> 01:09:19.001
OK.

01:09:22.587 --> 01:09:24.340
What's this?

01:09:24.924 --> 01:09:26.968
It's an apple.

01:09:27.093 --> 01:09:31.721
Good, but is it an apple
or just a picture of an apple?

01:09:37.228 --> 01:09:41.064
OK. So, uh, this is a joke, right?

01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:46.153
What are you saying?
That our... my eyes lie?

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:49.365
Your eyesight can
and will play tricks on you.

01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:54.453
No matter what I could teach you,
they'll still play tricks on you.

01:09:54.579 --> 01:09:58.291
- You've gotta trust your instincts.
- I don't have any.

01:09:58.416 --> 01:10:01.460
My instinct is to close my eyes
and feel my way out of here.

01:10:01.586 --> 01:10:05.840
That's a self-preservation instinct.
But you have others.

01:10:05.965 --> 01:10:10.928
Virgil, you have to learn to see,
just like you learned to speak.

01:10:11.053 --> 01:10:14.140
Perception, sight, life

01:10:14.265 --> 01:10:19.478
is about experience, reaching out
and exploring the world for yourself.

01:10:19.604 --> 01:10:23.316
It's not enough to just see.
We've got to look as well.

01:10:24.275 --> 01:10:27.195
Immediately following the operation

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:31.365
the patient experienced
extreme disorientation.

01:10:31.574 --> 01:10:34.076
Images and colours
had no meaning for him.

01:10:34.202 --> 01:10:36.287
But now,

01:10:36.412 --> 01:10:38.456
just weeks after surgery,

01:10:38.581 --> 01:10:44.629
Mr. Adamson has mastered the ability
to define shape and distance,

01:10:44.754 --> 01:10:48.549
giving him confidence
to move about his environment.

01:10:50.509 --> 01:10:51.928
He is still

01:10:52.053 --> 01:10:56.057
confused by new images
just as a child would be fascinated by

01:10:56.182 --> 01:10:58.684
everyday objects
that we take for granted.

01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:00.645
Look up.

01:11:01.979 --> 01:11:03.231
What is it?

01:11:03.356 --> 01:11:06.442
It's art. Dubuffet.

01:11:07.527 --> 01:11:09.820
This is art?

01:11:09.946 --> 01:11:14.659
Oh, now that has to be art! Look at that.
That is beautiful.

01:11:14.867 --> 01:11:18.246
Uh, no,
that's just somebody being destructive.

01:11:18.704 --> 01:11:21.624
- The words read something pretty nasty.
- What is it?

01:11:21.749 --> 01:11:23.793
It says pigshit.

01:11:25.211 --> 01:11:28.714
His progress is steady
but Virgil still relies on his touch

01:11:28.839 --> 01:11:32.802
- to interpret objects in his surroundings.
- It's a dog!

01:11:35.471 --> 01:11:37.098
I'm sorry, yes.

01:11:37.682 --> 01:11:40.726
His understanding
of three-dimensionality

01:11:40.851 --> 01:11:43.187
is very limited and confounding to him.

01:11:43.437 --> 01:11:46.232
Wow, listen to the bells.

01:11:46.357 --> 01:11:48.401
What's that? That lump?

01:11:50.403 --> 01:11:53.030
Oh, that's... that's a homeless person.

01:11:53.155 --> 01:11:55.283
You just walked right past him.

01:11:55.741 --> 01:11:57.660
You didn't even look.

01:11:57.785 --> 01:12:03.082
Well, some things you choose not to see.
You can't look at everything, Virgil.

01:12:03.207 --> 01:12:06.043
I don't want to look away.
I want to see everything.

01:12:06.168 --> 01:12:09.171
What the hell are you looking at?
Get outta here!

01:12:09.297 --> 01:12:13.968
He also has difficulty with scanning.
That's putting the whole picture together.

01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:23.811
I've got 10 years' experience
at Bear Mountain, in all kinds, really.

01:12:23.936 --> 01:12:27.106
Deep-tissue, therapeutic, shiatsu.

01:12:27.231 --> 01:12:29.692
That's fine. Let's get you started.

01:12:30.067 --> 01:12:34.405
Here's your l-9, W-4,
basic employment package. Fill these out.

01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:36.365
Take 'em over to Connie.

01:12:40.786 --> 01:12:43.998
Oh, gosh, you know what?
I forgot my glasses.

01:12:44.123 --> 01:12:45.875
I'll take this home,

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.128
- and fill it out, and bring it back, OK?
- All right.

01:12:49.253 --> 01:12:53.299
This includes his ability to read,
meaning he has

01:12:53.424 --> 01:12:55.468
a total lack of visual memory.

01:13:02.058 --> 01:13:05.394
Sweetie, it might help if you kind of...
take the word...

01:13:05.519 --> 01:13:08.689
No, it won't help, Amy.
I told you, it's not helping.

01:13:08.814 --> 01:13:12.276
I know what I'm supposed to do.
I just can't do it, OK?

01:13:12.401 --> 01:13:16.113
I can't read. When I reach the last letter
I can't remember the first.

01:13:16.239 --> 01:13:19.534
I can't fill out an application.
Somebody has to do it for me

01:13:19.659 --> 01:13:22.537
Like I'm blind, but I'm not blind.

01:13:22.828 --> 01:13:25.206
Your helping isn't helping.

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.544
OK, I'm sorry.

01:13:30.253 --> 01:13:33.172
This is an unexpected
physiological flaw,

01:13:33.297 --> 01:13:37.969
and one that we hope that, uh,
Virgil will be able to overcome.

01:13:39.762 --> 01:13:42.515
Well, that's it for today. Thank you.

01:13:46.102 --> 01:13:49.814
Mr. Adamson, Christie Evans from NYN.
Could you give us an idea

01:13:49.939 --> 01:13:52.149
- of what you're going through?
- That hurts.

01:13:52.275 --> 01:13:56.404
- Do you need to have that light on?
- Yeah. In terms of your operation,

01:13:56.529 --> 01:13:59.240
were the results met
with your expectations?

01:13:59.365 --> 01:14:02.243
Um, I didn't have any expectations.

01:14:03.035 --> 01:14:07.456
Information? In Pinecrest, New York,
for a Jennie Adamson.

01:14:09.542 --> 01:14:12.253
Um, here, maybe try this.

01:14:12.378 --> 01:14:13.838
What's that?

01:14:13.963 --> 01:14:16.007
You tell me.

01:14:17.133 --> 01:14:19.051
I don't know, it's a crocodile.

01:14:19.176 --> 01:14:23.306
- Come on, concentrate.
- I don't want to concentrate, Amy.

01:14:23.431 --> 01:14:26.517
Can't we just have one meal
where it's not about my eyes?

01:14:26.642 --> 01:14:28.686
I just want to sit here and eat.

01:14:29.353 --> 01:14:30.980
Just trying to be helpful.

01:14:31.105 --> 01:14:33.232
Let's talk about something else.

01:14:33.357 --> 01:14:37.111
How was your day? What happened?

01:14:37.236 --> 01:14:38.946
Fine. Nothing.

01:14:39.071 --> 01:14:44.619
Yeah... No, we were invited to a party
tomorrow night. Duncan's birthday.

01:14:46.537 --> 01:14:48.497
Is that it?

01:14:49.874 --> 01:14:51.918
What do you mean is that it?

01:14:52.084 --> 01:14:56.005
I'm telling you something
I thought you'd have a response to.

01:14:56.422 --> 01:14:58.466
Sorry, is that not enough?

01:15:00.009 --> 01:15:03.054
OK. I'll go. Uh...

01:15:03.638 --> 01:15:06.515
Why haven't you finished your sculpture?

01:15:07.934 --> 01:15:09.936
Where did that come from?

01:15:10.061 --> 01:15:12.396
I wanna know. I'm there every day and

01:15:12.522 --> 01:15:15.483
I, um, think it's perfect, it's beautiful.

01:15:15.608 --> 01:15:18.444
You said you didn't like it
and it wasn't finished.

01:15:18.569 --> 01:15:22.573
You said it like you never would.
So, that's why I'm asking.

01:15:23.324 --> 01:15:26.702
It's something I care a lot about,
and I can't get right.

01:15:26.827 --> 01:15:32.041
I see it in my head and I can't do it right.
It's beautiful and I'm failing it.

01:15:32.416 --> 01:15:35.294
So, maybe I'm not an artist.

01:15:41.008 --> 01:15:42.510
What's that?

01:15:44.637 --> 01:15:47.390
It's a lobster.

01:15:47.723 --> 01:15:49.850
People eat this?

01:15:52.645 --> 01:15:56.399
- OK, a measuring cup?
- Try again.

01:15:56.524 --> 01:15:59.652
Hey, you cheated!
You told me you couldn't touch.

01:15:59.861 --> 01:16:02.196
Sometimes you have to touch.

01:16:03.447 --> 01:16:05.783
- A cheese grater?
- Yeah.

01:16:08.369 --> 01:16:09.787
Hello?

01:16:10.872 --> 01:16:14.125
- It's me.
- Jennie! Hi!

01:16:15.001 --> 01:16:17.211
What are you doing here?

01:16:17.336 --> 01:16:20.423
You're being so mysterious.
Just tell me why we're here.

01:16:20.548 --> 01:16:23.050
- Well, um...
- What?

01:16:23.175 --> 01:16:26.053
- Our father's here.
- What?!

01:16:26.178 --> 01:16:29.724
I recognised his voice
the minute I answered the phone.

01:16:29.849 --> 01:16:31.851
Wha... Which one is he?

01:16:32.935 --> 01:16:36.272
There he is. He's the one
with the clipboard, the phone.

01:16:36.397 --> 01:16:39.192
- I... Oh, no, no, I can't see him.
- Yes, you can.

01:16:39.317 --> 01:16:42.778
- Jennie!
- Virgil, he's our father.

01:16:42.904 --> 01:16:45.489
He heard about the operation
and asked to see you.

01:16:45.615 --> 01:16:48.075
I'm not ready. No, no, Jennie.

01:17:15.978 --> 01:17:18.022
Virgil?

01:17:28.115 --> 01:17:30.159
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:34.914
Were you asleep?

01:17:35.206 --> 01:17:37.250
No, I just...

01:17:38.251 --> 01:17:40.711
..forget about the lights sometimes.

01:18:10.408 --> 01:18:13.786
You know,
I've been thinking about that party and

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.832
we don't have to go if you don't want to.
It's no big deal.

01:18:18.291 --> 01:18:23.337
It's your partner's birthday party.
You want me to meet your friends?

01:18:26.299 --> 01:18:27.300
Yeah.

01:18:40.771 --> 01:18:42.732
Glass of red or white?

01:18:45.318 --> 01:18:48.237
- Which one's red?
- That's red, that's white.

01:18:51.282 --> 01:18:53.409
That's the white. You want white?

01:19:06.047 --> 01:19:08.174
Quiet. Shh! He's coming!

01:19:08.299 --> 01:19:10.885
Kill the lights.

01:19:11.010 --> 01:19:14.639
- What's happening?
- It's for the surprise.

01:19:18.184 --> 01:19:21.646
- What?
- Nothing. You just had a hair out of place.

01:19:24.232 --> 01:19:26.359
What is this? What... You didn't?

01:19:26.776 --> 01:19:29.403
Surprise!

01:19:33.407 --> 01:19:34.909
Is he all right?

01:19:35.034 --> 01:19:38.371
Yeah. He's just kidding around.
He always plays jokes.

01:19:38.496 --> 01:19:41.207
Save me some cake!

01:19:48.130 --> 01:19:50.591
Hey, you. How's it all going?

01:19:50.716 --> 01:19:55.346
OK. He's progressing slowly,
but he's doing the best he can.

01:19:55.471 --> 01:19:59.559
Actually I was asking about
the mall designs, but, uh, that's OK.

01:19:59.684 --> 01:20:03.020
It's understandable.
So, how is it going?

01:20:03.145 --> 01:20:06.107
It's not quite what you expected, is it?

01:20:06.232 --> 01:20:08.609
What do you mean?

01:20:08.734 --> 01:20:11.737
You like this guy,
you want to help him out.

01:20:11.863 --> 01:20:14.824
Sometimes good intentions
aren't enough.

01:20:14.949 --> 01:20:17.243
Look at me, I'm still a jerk.

01:20:17.869 --> 01:20:19.787
Yeah. You are.

01:20:21.455 --> 01:20:23.916
Well, happy birthday, jerk.

01:20:31.883 --> 01:20:34.093
Aah. So, uh...

01:20:34.218 --> 01:20:37.305
We are expected in Atlanta tomorrow
with the plans.

01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:40.641
Duncan, I can't go.
There's just too much going on.

01:20:41.893 --> 01:20:42.894
Hey.

01:20:43.895 --> 01:20:47.273
Virgil, I wanted you to meet Duncan.
Duncan, Virgil.

01:20:47.398 --> 01:20:50.651
How's it going? Congratulations.
It's good to see you.

01:20:50.776 --> 01:20:54.572
- It's good to see anything.
- Come on, Duncan, let's dance.

01:20:54.697 --> 01:20:56.741
Duty calls.

01:20:56.866 --> 01:20:59.660
Amy, sorry about Atlanta.
Could have used you.

01:21:04.207 --> 01:21:06.417
Wha... What was that? Atlanta?

01:21:06.542 --> 01:21:10.963
Oh, he tried to spring a meeting on me.
I told him I wouldn't go.

01:21:11.088 --> 01:21:13.132
Did you change your hair?

01:21:13.674 --> 01:21:15.718
I just combed it.

01:21:23.559 --> 01:21:27.271
Do you think what Webster says is true,
that the eyes lie to us?

01:21:29.815 --> 01:21:31.984
- No, I don't.
- So, what does...

01:21:32.109 --> 01:21:35.029
What does you kissing Duncan say?

01:21:35.655 --> 01:21:38.699
- Oh, God...
- You kissed him. What does that say?

01:21:38.824 --> 01:21:43.871
- It says it's his birthday.
- I haven't seen a kiss like that before.

01:21:43.996 --> 01:21:48.042
Well, that's what
a birthday kiss looks like.

01:21:48.167 --> 01:21:50.002
What's this look mean?

01:21:50.127 --> 01:21:51.796
What look?

01:21:51.921 --> 01:21:55.216
This look. It's strange.
I don't understand what it means.

01:21:55.341 --> 01:21:57.593
- Nothing.
- What does it mean?

01:21:57.718 --> 01:22:00.930
It doesn't mean anything.
We're just talking.

01:22:01.055 --> 01:22:04.183
I'm just looking back at you.
It doesn't mean anything.

01:22:04.308 --> 01:22:06.227
Let's dance.

01:22:25.329 --> 01:22:28.708
Don't you want to dance some more?
Try this. It's fun.

01:22:32.169 --> 01:22:33.337
They just do letters.

01:22:36.132 --> 01:22:38.175
You wanna try? Just...

01:22:39.218 --> 01:22:41.429
- You just...
- I don't belong here.

01:22:43.973 --> 01:22:46.809
It's just a stupid dance. Virgil!

01:22:46.934 --> 01:22:49.854
- Hey, look.
- No, fuck looking!

01:22:52.148 --> 01:22:54.192
Oh, my God.

01:22:54.358 --> 01:22:56.402
- Take me home.
- Are you OK?

01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:02.700
- Honey, are you all right?
- Just take me home.

01:23:29.143 --> 01:23:31.896
God, you never stop, do you?

01:23:33.272 --> 01:23:36.234
Well, I've got to get it right.

01:23:36.943 --> 01:23:40.279
Besides, my plane leaves
first thing in the morning.

01:23:40.404 --> 01:23:42.448
Plane?

01:23:43.282 --> 01:23:45.326
I didn't think you were going.

01:23:46.744 --> 01:23:48.788
I'll only be gone a day or two.

01:23:52.041 --> 01:23:54.293
It's, uh, giving you problems, huh?

01:23:54.418 --> 01:23:56.003
What?

01:23:56.587 --> 01:23:59.090
This or us?

01:24:00.132 --> 01:24:01.551
Us.

01:24:03.511 --> 01:24:07.139
Amy, I wake up every morning and I

01:24:07.265 --> 01:24:09.600
stare and stare.

01:24:13.145 --> 01:24:16.440
And I'm looking at a total stranger.

01:24:16.566 --> 01:24:18.609
You don't see me?

01:24:19.068 --> 01:24:21.320
I was talking about me.

01:24:23.614 --> 01:24:25.658
You, I feel like

01:24:27.869 --> 01:24:30.454
I saw you better when I was blind.

01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:34.959
Well, you're not blind any more.
I'm sorry if that disappoints you.

01:24:37.086 --> 01:24:40.548
Look, I'm done here.
It's late and I gotta get up early.

01:24:41.674 --> 01:24:46.554
I'm gonna go to bed before
we both say things that we don't mean.

01:25:13.497 --> 01:25:15.791
Come on, Katie, your mom's waiting.

01:25:19.128 --> 01:25:21.088
- Hi.
- There you go.

01:25:21.214 --> 01:25:24.926
Hey, Virgil!
So you came crawling back, huh?

01:25:25.051 --> 01:25:26.052
Bye.

01:25:28.221 --> 01:25:30.598
You wanna join us? I could use your help.

01:25:30.723 --> 01:25:33.559
- Oh, no, I'll wait here till you're done.
- OK.

01:25:33.976 --> 01:25:36.187
Casey, come on, let's call it a day.

01:25:40.483 --> 01:25:44.445
- How is it, working with the kids?
- Great. They're the best.

01:25:44.570 --> 01:25:46.822
And they're the easiest because

01:25:46.948 --> 01:25:49.825
they're so eager
to make their way in the world.

01:25:49.951 --> 01:25:53.579
It's the adults who get stubborn.
Where did you go to blind school?

01:25:53.704 --> 01:25:55.748
I didn't. My father, uh,...

01:25:56.707 --> 01:26:00.878
I was just in regular school.
I picked it up... on my own.

01:26:01.003 --> 01:26:03.047
Oh... Great.

01:26:10.471 --> 01:26:11.472
Apple.

01:26:11.597 --> 01:26:14.100
We've gotta move on to vegetables.

01:26:14.225 --> 01:26:18.479
Come on, I got a place for you.
Should relax those eyes a bit.

01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:22.817
Seeing sucks.

01:26:22.942 --> 01:26:25.069
- Oh, you gotta be kidding.
- It sucks.

01:26:25.194 --> 01:26:28.197
You can say that,
sitting in these prime viewing seats?

01:26:28.322 --> 01:26:30.408
Forget your eyes.
Get your head examined.

01:26:30.533 --> 01:26:32.577
I'm serious.

01:26:32.869 --> 01:26:35.496
When I was blind, I couldn't see.
Don't laugh.

01:26:35.621 --> 01:26:40.543
I mean, people don't have expectations.
They know what you are.

01:26:40.668 --> 01:26:42.169
Or they think they know.

01:26:42.295 --> 01:26:44.672
They get on with it. They deal with it.

01:26:44.797 --> 01:26:47.633
Yeah.
Didn't get what you counted on, did you?

01:26:48.050 --> 01:26:51.137
Oh, boy. And now,
here's where it gets complicated.

01:26:51.262 --> 01:26:53.931
Now I can see,
but I don't know what I can see.

01:26:54.056 --> 01:26:56.601
Because your eyes play tricks on you,

01:26:56.726 --> 01:26:59.770
you see things that you don't wanna see.

01:27:00.813 --> 01:27:02.857
Jealousy.

01:27:03.107 --> 01:27:06.819
What's most important to you right now?
Seeing, or um...

01:27:07.403 --> 01:27:08.654
Amy.

01:27:08.779 --> 01:27:12.074
That's what I thought.
So we're not talking eyes here,

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.243
we're talking the heart.

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:16.787
The other night I was watching TV.

01:27:17.496 --> 01:27:21.083
One of the major disadvantages
of regaining sight, by the way.

01:27:21.209 --> 01:27:23.461
- There was this famous pianist.
- A what?

01:27:23.586 --> 01:27:27.715
Piano player. And he's about
six, seven hundred years old.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.134
- Will this be a long story?
- Could be.

01:27:30.259 --> 01:27:33.054
And they bring out
this seven-year-old prodigy.

01:27:33.179 --> 01:27:36.057
He plays Chopin,
backwards and forwards,

01:27:36.182 --> 01:27:40.478
with one arm tied behind his back,
spinning plates. Brilliant.

01:27:40.603 --> 01:27:45.399
The old master listened appreciatively
and at the end he said,

01:27:45.525 --> 01:27:48.611
"You played the piano very well."

01:27:48.736 --> 01:27:52.615
"Maybe one day
you will learn to make music."

01:27:54.033 --> 01:27:56.869
I think I know what you're saying.

01:27:56.994 --> 01:27:59.914
I don't know
if I'll ever be able to make music.

01:28:00.498 --> 01:28:02.333
You just gotta focus.

01:28:02.458 --> 01:28:04.502
Here. See my hand?

01:28:04.877 --> 01:28:07.964
- Yeah.
- All right. Now focus on it.

01:28:08.422 --> 01:28:12.218
Forget about everything else,
and that will be difficult here,

01:28:12.343 --> 01:28:14.387
but just look.

01:28:18.182 --> 01:28:22.144
And your point is?
OK, so, that's what? Seeing?

01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:24.856
No, Grasshopper, that's looking.

01:28:24.981 --> 01:28:26.899
Looking! You watch the fist.

01:28:27.024 --> 01:28:29.110
You see it'll hit you,
but did you want it to?

01:28:29.235 --> 01:28:31.404
- No.
- No. That's looking.

01:28:31.529 --> 01:28:34.031
Virgil, my advice after three beers,

01:28:34.156 --> 01:28:39.120
you'll see a lot, but none of that matters
if you lose sight of what you want.

01:28:42.123 --> 01:28:44.166
I love it.

01:28:46.878 --> 01:28:50.256
But... I don't care for the trees.

01:28:54.176 --> 01:28:56.846
I think we should lose them.

01:29:13.279 --> 01:29:16.115
The man just doesn't care for trees.
I dunno.

01:29:16.282 --> 01:29:20.661
How can the man not care for trees?
They were the best part of the location.

01:29:21.329 --> 01:29:23.247
We'll just have to change them.

01:29:23.372 --> 01:29:26.751
No harm there.
You'll come up with something better.

01:29:27.752 --> 01:29:31.214
Hey, um, let me buy you a drink, huh?

01:29:32.089 --> 01:29:34.550
Get those creative juices flowing.

01:29:34.675 --> 01:29:36.677
Oh, I think I have to go to bed.

01:29:36.802 --> 01:29:39.388
Come on. Look, they're playing our song.

01:29:39.847 --> 01:29:41.891
"Mack The Knife" was our song?

01:29:53.027 --> 01:29:55.821
See?

01:29:55.947 --> 01:29:57.990
Not so bad, huh?

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:01.244
Not so bad.

01:30:05.498 --> 01:30:08.376
It's nice dancing together again.

01:30:09.502 --> 01:30:11.546
Yeah.

01:30:13.548 --> 01:30:17.468
Do you remember the first time?

01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:21.722
Your sister's wedding in Connecticut?

01:30:23.307 --> 01:30:27.019
Yeah, it was beautiful
with all those red leaves falling.

01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:29.856
I'd love to go back some time.

01:30:29.981 --> 01:30:31.649
Mm.

01:30:31.774 --> 01:30:33.818
So would l.

01:30:37.488 --> 01:30:39.907
What happened to us?
Why'd you give up on us?

01:30:41.784 --> 01:30:45.413
I don't know. I think we... did it too fast,
you know.

01:30:45.538 --> 01:30:49.750
I was just a kid then,
falling in love with architecture.

01:30:49.959 --> 01:30:52.253
I never fell in love with architecture, but

01:30:53.129 --> 01:30:55.172
I know I fell in love with you.

01:30:56.173 --> 01:30:57.884
That's bullshit.

01:30:58.009 --> 01:31:00.761
Ah, well, hey. It used... It used to work.

01:31:22.867 --> 01:31:25.620
Oh, God, I'm sorry, I can't do this.

01:31:26.037 --> 01:31:28.289
This is wrong. I have to go home.

01:31:28.414 --> 01:31:31.083
You have to go home?

01:31:32.752 --> 01:31:34.795
To be a baby-sitter?

01:31:35.421 --> 01:31:37.465
Don't say that.

01:31:42.261 --> 01:31:43.387
Amy.

01:32:01.656 --> 01:32:02.740
Virgil?

01:32:11.082 --> 01:32:12.333
Virgil?!

01:32:12.458 --> 01:32:14.627
- He's gone, Amy.
- Gone?

01:32:14.752 --> 01:32:15.920
Gone where?

01:32:16.045 --> 01:32:18.923
The park.
Said he was looking for something.

01:32:38.526 --> 01:32:39.569
Virgil!

01:32:41.821 --> 01:32:43.865
Hey, Virgil!

01:32:49.036 --> 01:32:50.580
Virgil, watch out!

01:32:50.705 --> 01:32:53.165
Watch out!

01:32:54.333 --> 01:32:57.879
Jesus, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:32:58.004 --> 01:33:01.007
I was watching the cab
as it got closer to me.

01:33:01.132 --> 01:33:02.758
It's perspective.

01:33:02.884 --> 01:33:06.888
Yeah, but you'll get yourself killed
doing that in the street.

01:33:07.054 --> 01:33:09.432
I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry.

01:33:12.727 --> 01:33:14.645
Oh, boy.

01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:19.233
I went to the loft and you weren't there.
I thought that you had left.

01:33:20.026 --> 01:33:22.069
I thought about it.

01:33:23.237 --> 01:33:25.573
So, I came out here

01:33:25.698 --> 01:33:29.660
to try and see the horizon
that you described so beautifully.

01:33:32.914 --> 01:33:37.585
Oh... Oh, well you can't see it from here.
There's too many buildings.

01:33:38.085 --> 01:33:41.380
But that doesn't mean
it's not still here, right?

01:33:41.505 --> 01:33:45.134
Just because you can't see it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

01:33:45.259 --> 01:33:48.846
Right. Just because you can't see things

01:33:48.971 --> 01:33:54.435
doesn't mean that they don't exist.
I mean, that... that's what faith is, right?

01:33:57.021 --> 01:33:58.356
What's that look?

01:33:58.481 --> 01:34:01.234
What does that look mean?
That's a new look.

01:34:02.985 --> 01:34:05.363
Virgil, I have to tell you something.

01:34:05.655 --> 01:34:07.698
I was getting confused.

01:34:07.823 --> 01:34:10.701
But that doesn't excuse how I've acted.

01:34:12.787 --> 01:34:16.874
See, I thought I saw you slipping
further and further away from me.

01:34:16.999 --> 01:34:20.962
And I didn't see
that you were slipping away from me.

01:34:21.087 --> 01:34:22.713
I...

01:34:22.838 --> 01:34:26.926
Amy, uh, oh...
I don't know why I didn't tell you, but

01:34:27.051 --> 01:34:29.095
I want to say this. When...

01:34:29.929 --> 01:34:33.057
Well, Jennie came to see me
and I went to see my father.

01:34:33.850 --> 01:34:35.893
And I couldn't see him.

01:34:38.145 --> 01:34:40.106
I was afraid.

01:34:40.231 --> 01:34:42.441
I... felt like I was letting him down.

01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:45.278
Like I feel like I've let you down.

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:49.323
The only thing I ever wanted

01:34:51.158 --> 01:34:53.202
was to be whole.

01:34:54.245 --> 01:34:56.539
Not just to be able to ride a bike,

01:34:57.123 --> 01:35:00.126
or play in the playground like other kids,

01:35:00.251 --> 01:35:02.295
or go on a date.

01:35:04.839 --> 01:35:07.675
But to be whole,
to be needed by somebody,

01:35:08.426 --> 01:35:10.469
like I needed them.

01:35:13.389 --> 01:35:17.185
And the first time I ever felt like that
was with you.

01:35:21.022 --> 01:35:25.359
I know I have a lot to learn,
but I can see.

01:35:27.570 --> 01:35:29.780
And I don't want you to give up on me.

01:35:32.408 --> 01:35:34.702
I won't, Virgil.

01:35:37.079 --> 01:35:41.542
When I was in Atlanta
I realised how much that I need you.

01:35:43.794 --> 01:35:45.922
And I want you to come home with me.

01:35:49.926 --> 01:35:52.053
Until the operation, five weeks ago,

01:35:52.178 --> 01:35:54.764
Virgil had been a... touch person.

01:35:56.015 --> 01:36:03.189
Someone whose vocabulary, whose
sensibility, whose picture of the world

01:36:03.314 --> 01:36:06.359
is based on tactile, non-visual terms.

01:36:06.484 --> 01:36:09.737
But now, as a sighted person,

01:36:09.862 --> 01:36:13.741
by focusing single-mindedly on his goal,

01:36:13.866 --> 01:36:19.372
Virgil has a new-found ability
to understand distance and shape,

01:36:21.082 --> 01:36:23.459
color, perspective.

01:36:24.168 --> 01:36:28.297
And though there are still miles to go
in his learning process,

01:36:28.422 --> 01:36:33.261
for all medical intents and purposes,
he is... becoming a seeing person.

01:36:33.386 --> 01:36:35.429
- Hey!
- What?

01:36:36.222 --> 01:36:39.725
You want me to see, don't you?
Aren't I supposed to look?

01:36:39.851 --> 01:36:42.228
- Oh, my God!
- What?

01:36:42.353 --> 01:36:44.313
She is so flirting with you!

01:36:44.438 --> 01:36:46.232
What?

01:36:46.357 --> 01:36:48.401
- What's that look?
- What look?

01:36:48.818 --> 01:36:51.821
That look. You have so many looks.

01:36:51.946 --> 01:36:55.283
Uh, it was probably a jealous look, huh?

01:36:58.578 --> 01:37:00.830
It was the response to that look.

01:37:00.955 --> 01:37:04.292
OK, all right.
You wanna see my other looks?

01:37:04.417 --> 01:37:07.879
OK, this is what... sad looks like.

01:37:10.798 --> 01:37:14.844
Here is jubilation. Yippee!

01:37:14.969 --> 01:37:16.387
Careful.

01:37:16.512 --> 01:37:20.474
This is, uh, terrible... fear.

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:23.227
Extreme suspicion.

01:37:25.396 --> 01:37:28.608
It's all your fault.
I have an idea!

01:37:28.733 --> 01:37:30.026
Argh! Argh! Argh!

01:37:33.613 --> 01:37:35.323
Rrrargh!

01:37:40.828 --> 01:37:44.290
This is... I love you.

01:37:44.498 --> 01:37:46.959
Oh, this look I love.

01:38:05.228 --> 01:38:07.897
Yesterday, the clouds...

01:38:08.022 --> 01:38:10.608
No, in the sky, not my eyes.

01:38:11.067 --> 01:38:15.238
Oh, and purple.
Purple's the most amazing color.

01:38:15.530 --> 01:38:19.408
And Amy said yesterday
that we saw birds and...

01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:21.827
Um, um... What were they?

01:38:22.245 --> 01:38:23.621
- Pigeons.
- Pigeons!

01:38:23.746 --> 01:38:27.750
- Tell her about the fish market.
- Dozens of 'em. And the fish market!

01:38:27.875 --> 01:38:30.753
Salmon and, uh, crabs and octopus.

01:38:30.878 --> 01:38:34.215
How does anyone eat a octopus? OK.

01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:37.385
No, I don't know when I'll be back,
but I'll call soon.

01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:39.554
OK.

01:38:39.762 --> 01:38:41.305
Me, too. Bye.

01:38:41.514 --> 01:38:43.432
OK. Close your eyes.

01:38:47.436 --> 01:38:50.940
- Present.
- Oh, a tie!

01:38:51.816 --> 01:38:53.860
It's a large tie, too.

01:38:56.028 --> 01:38:58.739
There's gonna be an opening
for the lobby.

01:38:58.865 --> 01:39:01.200
They're gonna have a party. And

01:39:01.325 --> 01:39:03.411
I thought we could both
dress up to celebrate.

01:39:03.536 --> 01:39:05.913
It's your first time seeing
any of my work finished.

01:39:06.038 --> 01:39:08.040
- That's great.
- Huh!

01:39:11.043 --> 01:39:12.420
What's the matter?

01:39:12.545 --> 01:39:14.589
Nothing. It's really great.

01:39:15.131 --> 01:39:17.174
I like it a lot.

01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:20.636
You sure? It looks like it fits.

01:39:22.221 --> 01:39:24.265
You look great in it.

01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:25.725
Thanks.

01:39:54.337 --> 01:39:56.839
Hey, Virge, Virge! Where are you going?

01:40:06.182 --> 01:40:07.183
OK.

01:40:12.438 --> 01:40:14.398
- What does that mean?
- What?

01:40:14.524 --> 01:40:18.444
This, um, thing you did with your mouth.
What does that mean?

01:40:18.569 --> 01:40:24.158
Well, uh, I'm only...
registering sparks of activity.

01:40:24.575 --> 01:40:27.620
Retinal sparks, followed by nothing.

01:40:28.663 --> 01:40:31.123
So, uh, how long has this been going on?

01:40:31.249 --> 01:40:33.543
A couple of days.

01:40:33.668 --> 01:40:35.711
Have a seat.

01:40:37.713 --> 01:40:41.634
Your, uh...
Your retinal function is down 10%.

01:40:41.759 --> 01:40:45.596
I'm afraid the retinal disease
seems to have returned.

01:40:45.721 --> 01:40:49.267
But you corrected that.
You... I was healed of that. So...

01:40:49.392 --> 01:40:51.435
Well, l...

01:40:52.186 --> 01:40:55.064
I mean, I don't know whether, uh,

01:40:55.231 --> 01:41:00.152
you didn't have the blood vessels
to supply enough oxygen to your retinas.

01:41:01.779 --> 01:41:04.866
I wish there were an easy way to say this.

01:41:13.291 --> 01:41:15.334
When?

01:41:16.544 --> 01:41:18.588
Well, it's hard to say. Uh...

01:41:19.922 --> 01:41:22.216
A month. Two weeks.

01:41:24.343 --> 01:41:26.387
Today?

01:41:29.223 --> 01:41:31.267
I don't know.

01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:41.504
You look good.

01:42:42.046 --> 01:42:44.715
Hey, how do I look?

01:42:47.927 --> 01:42:49.971
I want some answers.

01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:52.974
Why did you leave?

01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:57.311
Because I was blind, or because
I gave up on your idea of me seeing?

01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:02.233
To the point. I like that.
That's something you got from me.

01:43:02.358 --> 01:43:05.111
You make jokes?
I haven't seen you in 20 years,

01:43:05.236 --> 01:43:07.071
you find out I can see,
you want to see me,

01:43:07.196 --> 01:43:10.366
- and you make jokes?
- Can we talk about this later?

01:43:10.491 --> 01:43:13.452
No, answer my question.
Why did you leave?

01:43:17.874 --> 01:43:21.919
I woke up every morning
and looked at you... and failure.

01:43:22.044 --> 01:43:24.088
My own failures.

01:43:25.256 --> 01:43:28.009
If I couldn't get my own son to see, then...

01:43:31.304 --> 01:43:34.056
But it's water under the bridge now, right?

01:43:35.183 --> 01:43:38.978
You can see! Hell, I knew you could!

01:43:39.103 --> 01:43:41.147
Yeah, I can see.

01:43:43.649 --> 01:43:45.776
And I'm going blind again.

01:43:48.112 --> 01:43:50.323
You're the first person I've told.

01:43:51.866 --> 01:43:56.329
I wanted to see you, look in your eyes,
while you explained my whole life.

01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:00.666
You know what you did to Jennie?
To my mom?

01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:05.671
You shouldn't have done that,... Dad.

01:44:06.589 --> 01:44:08.633
You shouldn't have left.

01:44:09.967 --> 01:44:12.011
You shouldn't have left.

01:44:47.129 --> 01:44:51.050
Yeah, a little bit higher, like an inch...
Half inch. Good.

01:44:51.634 --> 01:44:54.095
Hold that thought, wait.

01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:56.264
Hey!

01:44:57.306 --> 01:44:59.350
What are you doing here?

01:45:00.601 --> 01:45:04.313
God, I didn't want you to see it yet.
It's not done.

01:45:04.438 --> 01:45:06.023
I came to see you.

01:45:06.148 --> 01:45:08.818
I wanted to tell you something. OK?

01:45:11.821 --> 01:45:14.156
I had this idea, OK? Bear with me.

01:45:14.282 --> 01:45:17.743
Cos things are going so great
and you're doing so well,

01:45:17.869 --> 01:45:22.373
and I've got the Atlanta mall,
so we've got more money coming in,

01:45:22.498 --> 01:45:28.504
I thought that we could take a trip.
A sort of, um, a seeing celebration.

01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:30.673
A seeing celebration?

01:45:31.090 --> 01:45:32.091
Yeah.

01:45:32.216 --> 01:45:35.678
I thought that we could, um,
that we could go to Egypt.

01:45:35.803 --> 01:45:38.347
We can both see the pyramids
for the first time.

01:45:38.472 --> 01:45:41.475
- Amy...
- And then I could take you to Paris.

01:45:41.601 --> 01:45:43.853
I could show you Notre Dame,

01:45:43.978 --> 01:45:47.732
with the gargoyles
and the water with the light on it,

01:45:47.857 --> 01:45:52.236
and the stained glass. You'll love it.
There's so much I want to show you.

01:45:52.361 --> 01:45:56.490
The windows and the water.
We'd have the most wonderful time.

01:45:57.450 --> 01:45:59.493
What do you think?

01:46:03.456 --> 01:46:05.499
I think...

01:46:08.544 --> 01:46:12.006
There is...
There is one place I'd like to see.

01:46:55.049 --> 01:46:57.093
Whoo!

01:48:15.922 --> 01:48:18.132
Virgil! Virgil.

01:48:23.971 --> 01:48:26.682
- Are you OK?
- The puffy thing.

01:48:27.975 --> 01:48:31.103
This is the puffy thing. This is the cloud?

01:48:32.146 --> 01:48:36.234
You found the puffy thing.
Oh, my God! It's cotton candy.

01:48:36.651 --> 01:48:38.694
Oh, my God.

01:48:49.956 --> 01:48:53.960
Thank you so much
for taking me here. This was wonderful.

01:49:00.383 --> 01:49:02.426
Are you OK?

01:49:03.719 --> 01:49:05.763
Yeah... I'm just

01:49:05.930 --> 01:49:08.558
having a... bad eye day.

01:49:10.268 --> 01:49:12.311
It's a lot to take in.

01:49:13.646 --> 01:49:15.690
I'm OK now. It's just...

01:49:16.148 --> 01:49:19.360
I'm sorry.
These people wanna get by over here.

01:49:19.485 --> 01:49:21.988
- What?
- These people on the right.

01:49:22.113 --> 01:49:24.407
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Excuse us.

01:49:29.579 --> 01:49:33.249
Honey, what's going on?
What's happening with your eyes?

01:49:35.918 --> 01:49:37.169
Blackouts.

01:49:37.879 --> 01:49:39.881
This one's the longest.

01:49:40.006 --> 01:49:42.508
I just want to go home, OK?

01:49:42.633 --> 01:49:48.097
Baby, wait... one second.
Has this... happened before today?

01:49:54.687 --> 01:49:56.731
I'm going blind.

01:49:57.481 --> 01:49:59.525
What?

01:50:00.484 --> 01:50:03.863
What do you mean?
What's wrong? I mean, what...

01:50:03.988 --> 01:50:07.116
You've... had blackouts.
Maybe your eyes are overworked.

01:50:07.241 --> 01:50:09.994
You've been seeing so much,
getting so excited.

01:50:10.119 --> 01:50:13.039
- No.
- We can... go to the doctor

01:50:13.164 --> 01:50:16.834
and he'll tell us what's happening.
I mean, maybe, you know,

01:50:16.959 --> 01:50:21.047
- it's just been too fast...
- Amy, can we just go home?

01:50:24.675 --> 01:50:26.677
Baby, let's go to the doctor...

01:50:26.802 --> 01:50:29.847
I saw Dr Aaron.
There's nothing they can do.

01:50:29.972 --> 01:50:31.849
We'll go to another doctor.

01:50:31.974 --> 01:50:35.394
What... do you want me to say?
You want it explained another way?

01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:37.563
I'm going blind.

01:50:38.064 --> 01:50:41.359
- Let's...
- That's what's happening. I'm going blind.

01:50:41.484 --> 01:50:43.528
I just...

01:50:44.529 --> 01:50:45.947
..wanna go home.

01:50:46.572 --> 01:50:49.700
Baby, don't give up.
We got... We got you to s...

01:50:49.825 --> 01:50:51.869
I just want to go home.

01:51:00.503 --> 01:51:02.547
It was a good game.

01:51:20.064 --> 01:51:22.108
What are you doing?

01:51:22.525 --> 01:51:24.569
I'm leaving.

01:51:24.694 --> 01:51:29.073
What do you mean?
You're leaving... this apartment?

01:51:29.365 --> 01:51:32.618
You're leaving New York,
or you're leaving me?

01:51:33.578 --> 01:51:35.621
I'm going home.

01:51:37.748 --> 01:51:40.001
What, are you going home to Jennie?

01:51:45.006 --> 01:51:47.466
Is she gonna take care of you now?

01:51:47.592 --> 01:51:50.344
I'm not going through this bullshit again.

01:51:50.595 --> 01:51:51.679
Bullshit?

01:51:52.763 --> 01:51:58.436
- That's what this has been? Bullshit?
- Yes, it's bullshit! Who are we kidding?

01:51:58.895 --> 01:52:00.938
I'm blind. I can't see.

01:52:01.063 --> 01:52:03.733
OK? I don't belong here.
I'm not meant to see.

01:52:03.858 --> 01:52:08.571
Goddamn right, you're blind.
I'm here for you, and you don't even look.

01:52:10.156 --> 01:52:12.200
Why are you shutting me out?

01:52:12.325 --> 01:52:15.912
Why didn't you tell me
what was going on with you?

01:52:16.829 --> 01:52:20.416
Do you know
why I remembered the cotton candy?

01:52:20.791 --> 01:52:25.171
Because it's the one thing in my life
I remember with my father that was good.

01:52:25.296 --> 01:52:29.050
After I went blind, he pushed to try
to make me into something that I'm not.

01:52:29.175 --> 01:52:32.094
Then he turns his back on me
when his plans fail.

01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:34.347
But I'm not turning my back on you.

01:52:34.764 --> 01:52:37.308
I promised you I wouldn't give up on you.

01:52:37.433 --> 01:52:41.729
Don't give up on me!
Give up on the idea of me seeing!

01:52:41.854 --> 01:52:44.690
Didn't you want something more
out of your life?

01:52:44.815 --> 01:52:47.568
That's all I wanted
to give you a chance for.

01:52:47.693 --> 01:52:51.531
Jesus Christ! Did you think
you'd sit in that school bus

01:52:51.656 --> 01:52:54.075
and work in the spa the rest of your life?

01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:57.954
Didn't you have dreams?
To see or learn or do more than that?

01:52:58.079 --> 01:53:03.000
- You have so much to give of yourself.
- And so much to be taken away.

01:53:03.709 --> 01:53:05.962
Oh, God... Agh!

01:53:08.381 --> 01:53:10.424
Goddammit.

01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:14.303
Your sculpture.

01:53:17.557 --> 01:53:19.600
I'm sorry.

01:53:20.643 --> 01:53:24.230
It's just...
We both didn't get what we wanted.

01:53:26.732 --> 01:53:28.776
I wanted you.

01:53:30.236 --> 01:53:34.073
When you asked me here
did you ever think it wouldn't work out?

01:53:34.198 --> 01:53:36.909
That... I might not be able to see?

01:53:39.787 --> 01:53:43.583
Did you ever think about
what it would be like to just

01:53:43.708 --> 01:53:47.962
be with me, the blind man?

01:53:55.553 --> 01:53:57.597
There's my answer.

01:54:37.386 --> 01:54:41.349
Jessie, aah... look at you.
Let me look at you.

01:54:42.892 --> 01:54:44.936
What a beautiful color you are.

01:54:46.854 --> 01:54:49.315
What a good dog.

01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:53.236
Everything's the same as when you left.
Nothing's changed.

01:56:37.215 --> 01:56:39.258
- Hello?
- Hi.

01:56:39.383 --> 01:56:41.427
Hi.

01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:44.514
Hey, Jess.

01:56:45.473 --> 01:56:47.517
Hi.

01:56:47.808 --> 01:56:50.186
I picked up some things at the store.

01:56:50.311 --> 01:56:53.981
Some, uh, T-shirts...
Socks, you're probably out.

01:56:54.106 --> 01:56:55.983
You are so beautiful.

01:56:57.944 --> 01:57:00.905
Why didn't you tell me
you were beautiful?

01:57:01.364 --> 01:57:04.575
I just told you
what you needed to know, that's all.

01:57:05.535 --> 01:57:07.578
Look at me.

01:57:07.703 --> 01:57:10.122
Why do people look away?

01:57:13.876 --> 01:57:15.920
What do you want?

01:57:16.295 --> 01:57:18.339
I want to see you.

01:57:18.673 --> 01:57:21.300
Isn't there anything more you want?

01:57:21.425 --> 01:57:24.971
You've spent your whole life
as blind as I was.

01:57:25.096 --> 01:57:28.015
Virgil, please. This is your home.

01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:32.603
Don't worry about things
that don't matter to you. You're safe here.

01:57:32.728 --> 01:57:36.649
You matter to me.
This was a great place to grow up.

01:57:36.774 --> 01:57:38.818
It was very safe.

01:57:39.485 --> 01:57:41.529
But I grew up.

01:57:42.905 --> 01:57:46.200
I can't even imagine
the things you gave up for me.

01:57:46.325 --> 01:57:49.078
I just want to look at you.
Look at me, Jennie.

01:57:50.496 --> 01:57:54.208
I wanna say thank you.
I love you from the bottom of my soul.

01:57:55.126 --> 01:57:57.420
And I want to give you your life back.

01:58:06.095 --> 01:58:07.096
I can't.

01:58:08.764 --> 01:58:10.808
Yes, you can.

01:58:13.769 --> 01:58:15.813
Jennie,...

01:58:18.149 --> 01:58:20.193
...I'm reaching out.

01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:32.557
Growing up blind, I had two dreams.

01:59:33.432 --> 01:59:35.476
One was to see.

01:59:35.601 --> 01:59:38.688
The other was to play hockey
for the New York Rangers.

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:45.361
After the... miracle
of my brief period of sight,

01:59:45.653 --> 01:59:50.449
if I had to choose, I'd rather play hockey
for the New York Rangers.

01:59:52.118 --> 01:59:56.372
It wasn't that seeing was so bad.
I saw a lot of things.

01:59:56.497 --> 02:00:01.502
Um, some were really beautiful.
Others were scary.

02:00:03.713 --> 02:00:06.549
Some things, I'm, um, already forgetting.

02:00:09.051 --> 02:00:11.512
A particular look in a pair of eyes,

02:00:13.306 --> 02:00:15.349
clouds.

02:00:17.810 --> 02:00:22.690
Those images will stay with me
long after the light fades.

02:00:24.984 --> 02:00:29.447
As a blind man, I think that I see

02:00:29.572 --> 02:00:33.826
a lot better than I did
while I was sighted.

02:00:35.161 --> 02:00:38.289
Because I don't really think
we see with our eyes.

02:00:39.290 --> 02:00:42.919
I think, um, we live in darkness when

02:00:43.544 --> 02:00:46.839
we don't look at
what's real about ourselves,

02:00:47.465 --> 02:00:50.384
or about others, or about life.

02:00:51.594 --> 02:00:55.765
I think, uh, no operation can do that.

02:00:56.265 --> 02:00:57.266
And

02:00:58.434 --> 02:01:00.811
when you see what's real

02:01:00.937 --> 02:01:02.980
about yourself,

02:01:03.689 --> 02:01:05.483
then you've seen a lot.

02:01:05.608 --> 02:01:06.817
Good boy.

02:01:06.943 --> 02:01:08.986
And you don't need eyes for that.

02:01:09.654 --> 02:01:11.697
Want a bite?

02:01:27.296 --> 02:01:29.799
- You missed.
- Missed?

02:01:30.216 --> 02:01:31.384
Amy?

02:01:32.593 --> 02:01:33.594
Hey.

02:01:34.929 --> 02:01:35.930
Hi.

02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:43.062
Um...

02:01:43.187 --> 02:01:45.147
I was just in the neighbourhood.

02:01:47.692 --> 02:01:50.903
No, uh, Phil told me
that you were working here.

02:01:51.612 --> 02:01:54.866
And I thought
maybe I could find you in the park.

02:01:56.951 --> 02:02:02.748
I rushed, didn't l? 14 paces to the tree,
and I made us slam right into it.

02:02:02.874 --> 02:02:04.917
We tried.

02:02:05.251 --> 02:02:07.378
Are you happy?

02:02:08.462 --> 02:02:10.506
I'm... I'm trying to be.

02:02:11.507 --> 02:02:13.634
Work is good. I went out on my own.

02:02:13.759 --> 02:02:15.720
What happened to Duncan?

02:02:15.845 --> 02:02:17.805
He's building mini malls.

02:02:20.725 --> 02:02:22.226
Where's Jessie?

02:02:22.351 --> 02:02:25.229
Jessie's at home with Jennie.
This is Pierce.

02:02:26.397 --> 02:02:27.398
My new dog.

02:02:28.316 --> 02:02:30.234
He's a good boy.

02:02:30.359 --> 02:02:32.153
Hello, Pierce.

02:02:32.278 --> 02:02:34.322
Hello, sweetie.

02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:39.911
Virgil, I finished the sculpture.

02:02:41.078 --> 02:02:43.456
I didn't know where it was going to go.

02:02:43.956 --> 02:02:46.000
But that was OK.

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:50.546
I really enjoyed
letting it take on its own life.

02:02:50.838 --> 02:02:52.924
Letting it be just what it was.

02:02:53.049 --> 02:02:56.427
Without me pushing or doubting myself.

02:02:58.179 --> 02:03:00.681
And what it was, was beautiful.

02:03:02.183 --> 02:03:04.227
I saw the horizon.

02:03:05.394 --> 02:03:07.438
It's out there.

02:03:08.648 --> 02:03:11.567
Even though I may not
ever be able to touch it,

02:03:13.361 --> 02:03:15.404
it's worth reaching for.

02:03:18.908 --> 02:03:20.952
You showed me that.

02:03:25.039 --> 02:03:27.291
Thank you.

02:03:34.131 --> 02:03:36.175
Um...

02:03:36.592 --> 02:03:39.887
- Do you wanna walk?
- See what we see?

02:03:41.597 --> 02:03:44.684
Yeah, just... see what we see.

02:04:20.887 --> 02:04:22.847
- Lead on, Macduff.
- OK.
