It was to a cell phone

00:29.620 --> 00:31.990
<i>And today those

00:32.140 --> 00:33.540
Did you even consult
a lawyer before

00:33.540 --> 00:35.470
you shot a man with a drone?
Gideon: We both know that

00:35.480 --> 00:39.180
this is as much about the fact
that your ex-wife works here.

00:39.180 --> 00:41.550
This is a crowbar. Just plug it
in to the district servers.

00:41.550 --> 00:42.910
It'll pry open
an encrypted back door

00:42.920 --> 00:44.480

I'm not doing that.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.480
Yes, you are.

00:49.090 --> 00:50.560
Where'd that car come from?

00:50.560 --> 00:52.220
Brandt: <i>I don't know, squad.
Out of nowhere.</i>

00:52.230 --> 00:54.260
I'd say they got somebody
on a computer looking

00:54.260 --> 00:55.260
out for them, too.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.560
What is that?
- Secret lab.

00:58.570 --> 01:01.000
1309, squad, we have
three armed assailants

01:01.000 --> 01:02.400
approaching gideon's house.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.200
The stuff that I work on down
here is highly experimental.

01:05.209 --> 01:07.040
And completely illegal.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.940
<i>The guy in the mask

Get on the ground now!

01:43.910 --> 01:45.410
Yeah, this is base, yeah?

01:45.410 --> 01:47.280
We got a problem
with the video surveillance.

01:48.450 --> 01:51.420
Oh, great.
The radio's down too?

01:51.420 --> 01:53.820

No.

criticizing Reeves.

singling out Reeves personally.

02:58.050 --> 03:01.690
Gideon Reeves has turned
our city into a target,

03:01.690 --> 03:05.120
<i>and once and for all,
he should be held accountable.</i>

03:05.130 --> 03:06.790
He's serious.

03:06.790 --> 03:08.730
I've already had
two calls from city hall.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.700
He's going after us? That...

03:10.700 --> 03:13.400
He knows that we were the ones
that got attacked, right?

03:13.400 --> 03:14.670
Did you mention that?

03:14.670 --> 03:16.970
All he sees is a chance
to send you packing.

03:16.970 --> 03:19.040
The assistant state's
attorney is already here,

03:19.040 --> 03:20.810
waiting to help
with your luggage.

03:20.810 --> 03:23.040
Well, we have
a terrorist to catch, right?

03:23.040 --> 03:25.340
He tried
to kill me.
- And me.

03:25.350 --> 03:27.180
We need to talk about ada.

03:27.180 --> 03:28.650
That's a complicated situation.

03:28.650 --> 03:29.810
Is it?

03:29.820 --> 03:31.550
She confessed to working
with a hacker.

03:31.550 --> 03:33.550
The same hacker
who tried to kill us.

03:33.550 --> 03:35.220
I know, but...
- But what?

03:35.220 --> 03:37.660
She should be in interrogation,
not sitting in the ops center.

03:37.660 --> 03:39.520
She's a criminal.
That's debatable.

03:39.530 --> 03:41.990
This isn't. She's not a cop.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.330
I mean, am I wrong here?

03:43.330 --> 03:46.260
I'll admit
the kid's grown on me, but,

03:46.270 --> 03:49.400
gideon, we're sworn to uphold
the law here, and she broke it.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.540
No question ada did some things
that she should not have.

03:52.540 --> 03:53.870
She was trying to help.

03:53.870 --> 03:54.870
She saved lives.

03:54.870 --> 03:56.410
But she took one to do it.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.540
Gideon, you and I have had
this conversation.

03:58.550 --> 04:00.180
Nobody gets to change the rules,

04:00.180 --> 04:02.010
not even
if it's for a good reason.

04:02.020 --> 04:04.350
Not you, not me,
and especially not ada.
- Okay!

04:04.350 --> 04:07.590
Okay, yes, yes, yes, but...
Reality check here...

04:07.590 --> 04:09.420
We are going up
against a hacker.

04:09.420 --> 04:10.860
Not just any hacker.

04:10.860 --> 04:12.860
A hacker
that ada personally knows.

04:12.860 --> 04:15.530
So unless you're planning
on getting a graduate degree

04:15.530 --> 04:17.529
in computer science
in the next half hour,

04:17.529 --> 04:20.130
I mean, pretty sure we need her.

04:20.130 --> 04:22.270
Conrad: For now I'm
inclined to agree.

04:22.270 --> 04:24.600
Murph, gideon's got
to talk to the a.S.A.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.240
We got a bad guy to catch.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.270
I think it's best we get on it.

04:32.150 --> 04:35.050
Murphy, hey, I really am
so sorry about all of the...

04:35.050 --> 04:38.620
You're sorry? It's a little late
for that now, don't you think?

04:38.620 --> 04:39.780
Yeah. Um...

04:39.790 --> 04:41.150
When you and gideon got here,

04:41.150 --> 04:42.790
I defended you.

04:42.790 --> 04:44.290
I trusted you.

04:44.290 --> 04:46.390
Then you turn around and stab us
in the back like this?

04:46.390 --> 04:48.890
You put everything
that we worked for at risk.

04:48.900 --> 04:51.400
So what the hell good
is your sorry gonna do

04:51.400 --> 04:52.800
when this district is shut down?

04:52.800 --> 04:54.800
Yeah, I thought so.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.230
Now I have a suspect
to interrogate.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.140
And if it wasn't for gideon,
it would be you.

05:00.940 --> 05:03.470
Mayor salgado wants
the 13th district

05:03.480 --> 05:06.310
to stand down,
effective immediately.

05:06.310 --> 05:08.080
Ah, so, what? We're just
supposed to walk away?

05:08.080 --> 05:10.250
The mayor realizes we're
actually doing a job, right?

05:10.250 --> 05:11.780
Is he gonna order
all the criminals

05:11.790 --> 05:13.350
to stand down as well?

05:13.350 --> 05:16.150
He's getting approval from the
city council for an injunction,

05:16.160 --> 05:18.860
giving the 12th district
control of the 13th.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.760
The leadership... you, the
captain... will be suspended.

05:21.760 --> 05:24.460
You have been after the 13th
since I got here.

05:24.460 --> 05:26.760
No, no, no. This isn't about me.

05:26.770 --> 05:29.100
This is about your arrogance.

05:29.100 --> 05:31.770
Yes, yes, yes, that is true.
You are right.

05:31.770 --> 05:34.440
I was. I was arrogant.
Danny reghabi,

05:34.440 --> 05:36.770
dv8, whatever he's called...

05:36.780 --> 05:39.440
He's coming after the 13th
'cause of me, but you know

05:39.450 --> 05:40.650
what else is true?

05:40.650 --> 05:42.510
We are dealing
with a very dangerous person.

05:42.520 --> 05:44.120
And we are the only district

05:44.120 --> 05:46.280
that could even begin
to handle him.

05:46.290 --> 05:48.120
So, if you have to...

05:48.120 --> 05:50.120
I don't know...
Arrest me, shoot me,

05:50.120 --> 05:51.620
whatever, knock yourself out.

05:51.620 --> 05:54.290
As long as I'm here,
I have a job to do.

05:54.290 --> 05:56.860
According to your prints,
you're Jack nagle.

05:56.860 --> 05:59.200
Priors for armed robbery,
assault and

05:59.200 --> 06:01.170
being a dumbass crook
in general, so,

06:01.170 --> 06:02.700
you want to tell me
how you ended up

06:02.700 --> 06:04.140
working for Danny reghabi?

06:04.140 --> 06:05.970
I'm sorry. Dv8.

06:05.970 --> 06:06.970
Nope.

06:06.970 --> 06:08.310
Here's the deal.

06:08.310 --> 06:10.140
We got you on attempted murder,

06:10.140 --> 06:12.740
home invasion and weapons
charges, all on video.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.050
So unless you want to die
in prison, start talking.

06:17.020 --> 06:20.550
Gideon:
Ah, I see Murphy's
working her magic.

06:20.550 --> 06:22.090
How'd it go
with the a.S.A.?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.760
Huh?
Oh, just a misunderstanding.

06:23.760 --> 06:25.660
He's buying me a lobster
at Shaw's,

06:25.660 --> 06:27.160
hanging my portrait
at city hall.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.760
How's the interrogation going?

06:28.760 --> 06:29.830
I've seen better.

06:29.830 --> 06:32.400
Ada, bring up the
biometric chair feed.

06:35.170 --> 06:37.600
How do you know Danny reghabi?

06:37.600 --> 06:39.870
I'm not telling you
a damn thing.

06:39.870 --> 06:41.610
He's got to be
protecting someone.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.340
Probably himself.

06:43.340 --> 06:46.240
Danny is frighteningly good
at getting to anyone, any time,

06:46.250 --> 06:47.280
anywhere.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.910
Ooh, hear that, murph?

06:48.920 --> 06:51.250
<i>Sounds like this guy's more
scared of our psycho hacker</i>

06:51.250 --> 06:52.880
<i>than he is of going to jail.</i>

06:52.890 --> 06:56.720
<i>That might be something
you can use, huh?</i>

06:56.720 --> 06:58.060
Do you really think

06:58.060 --> 07:00.120
keeping your mouth shut's
gonna keep you safe?

07:01.130 --> 07:02.460
Do you have any idea

07:02.460 --> 07:04.530
what Danny can do to you
if we don't catch him?

07:04.530 --> 07:07.970
We can't protect you in jail.

07:09.570 --> 07:11.270
Gideon:
Yeah.

07:11.270 --> 07:13.370
Spiking him there, murph.
Let him have it.

07:13.370 --> 07:16.210
All it takes is one digital
favor to the Aryan nation,

07:16.210 --> 07:17.540
and you're bleeding out
in the showers

07:17.540 --> 07:18.910
with a swastika
carved into your back.

07:18.910 --> 07:19.910
You can't do that.

07:19.910 --> 07:21.380
It won't be us doing anything.

07:21.380 --> 07:24.550
Your only hope is
if we catch this guy.

07:24.550 --> 07:27.220
Maybe he'll forgive you,
let you walk away.

07:27.220 --> 07:30.050
I mean, I don't know.
You know him more than I do.

07:31.620 --> 07:33.690
I don't know much, okay?

07:38.730 --> 07:39.900
I'm listening.

07:39.900 --> 07:40.970
We were supposed to meet him

07:40.970 --> 07:43.230
at a train yard
at 52nd and Western.

07:43.240 --> 07:46.100
The job paid 50 grand a piece.
That's it.

07:46.110 --> 07:47.570
That's all I know.

07:47.570 --> 07:49.740
I'm gonna give you
a little pro tip.

07:49.740 --> 07:51.940
Next time you take a job
from a psychopath,

07:51.950 --> 07:53.310
I'd ask more questions.

07:54.980 --> 07:57.250
<i>We got to check out
that train yard.</i>

07:57.250 --> 08:00.020
I'm taking every available unit
and heading out there now.

08:00.020 --> 08:02.120
Wait.<i> You</i> are?

08:02.120 --> 08:03.750
That son of a bitch

08:03.760 --> 08:05.460
came after you,
he came after Murphy.

08:05.460 --> 08:06.920
Hell, he came after all of us.

08:06.930 --> 08:10.330
It's time I got out on the
streets, made my feelings known.

08:20.610 --> 08:22.610
You know, you're the captain.

08:22.610 --> 08:24.510
You could've taken
one of the caddies.

08:24.510 --> 08:27.610
Hey, I let you put a camera
in it, didn't I?

08:27.610 --> 08:31.220
<i>Call me old-fashioned,
but I like my ride just fine.</i>

08:32.789 --> 08:33.990
1309, squad.

08:33.990 --> 08:36.020
Listen, you have to be careful.

08:36.020 --> 08:38.190
I've seen what this guy can do,
and he's not messing around.

08:38.190 --> 08:40.789
Copy that, 1309.
Neither are we.

08:40.789 --> 08:42.530
Brandt:
<i>Easy there, crusher.</i>

08:42.530 --> 08:45.360
Me and goss are the only two
cops who have ever come close

08:45.370 --> 08:46.630
to busting this guy.

08:46.630 --> 08:48.470
We're getting
first crack at him.

08:48.470 --> 08:50.800
Conrad:
<i>I don't care who nails dv8.</i>

08:50.800 --> 08:53.640
<i>We got to work together,</i>

08:53.640 --> 08:55.170
<i>keep our eyes open.</i>

08:55.170 --> 08:57.140
God only knows
how he's gonna come at us.

09:01.850 --> 09:03.450
Captain!

09:08.190 --> 09:10.250
1309, squad,
we need an ambulance!

09:14.930 --> 09:17.230
Conrad! Conrad, you okay?

09:17.230 --> 09:19.230
Brandt, help me out with this!

09:19.230 --> 09:21.000
You two, go check
the other cars!

09:21.000 --> 09:23.030
Dude just ran right through
a red light.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.500
No, he didn't.
Brandt, look.

09:25.510 --> 09:27.410
They're all green.

09:27.410 --> 09:29.840
<i>Squad, do you see this?
What the hell is going on?!</i>

09:29.840 --> 09:31.040
I'm trying to get into
the transportation system,

09:31.040 --> 09:32.040
but something's wrong.

09:32.050 --> 09:33.610
That's putting it mildly.

09:36.880 --> 09:40.620
Someone has hacked
the entire transportation grid.

09:44.420 --> 09:46.020
Someone?

09:46.030 --> 09:48.090
Murphy...

09:48.090 --> 09:49.930
It's him.

09:53.300 --> 09:56.700
Oh, I think his ribs
are broken.
- All right, all right.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.340
We got you, captain, right here.

10:00.410 --> 10:01.810
What the hell is that?

10:01.810 --> 10:03.370
I don't know. I found it
in the back of the cruiser.

10:03.380 --> 10:04.640
It's space bandages
or something.

10:04.640 --> 10:07.550
Female voice:
<i>Please indicate your emergency.</i>

10:08.750 --> 10:10.780
<i>Place the dressing labeled</i>

10:10.780 --> 10:12.650
<i>a-15 on the wound</i>

10:12.650 --> 10:14.320
<i>and apply...</i>

10:14.320 --> 10:17.220
<i>Check the patient
for internal bleeding...</i>

10:17.220 --> 10:19.590
Hey, hey, hey, you stay there!
You back up!

10:19.590 --> 10:21.060
Come on! Back up!

10:21.060 --> 10:23.260
Cobb, this is crazy.

10:23.260 --> 10:24.500
Oh, man.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.660
You okay? Okay.
I'm good. I'm good.

10:26.670 --> 10:28.930
1309, squad,
we got multiple car accidents.

10:28.940 --> 10:31.070
We need medical assistance now.

10:40.110 --> 10:43.450
I see you, you bastard.

10:43.450 --> 10:44.850
Paramedics are on the way, 1309,

10:44.850 --> 10:47.120
but they're gonna be a while.
We have crashes across

10:47.120 --> 10:48.620
30 blocks.
- Ada,

10:48.620 --> 10:50.490
there has to be a way
into that system.

10:50.490 --> 10:52.020
Yes, normally there would be,

10:52.030 --> 10:53.960
but this hack isn't
at the central computer.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.760
He must have hardwired his way
into one of the field offices.

10:56.760 --> 10:57.800
How would he do that?

10:57.800 --> 10:59.200
Because he has a small piece

10:59.200 --> 11:00.600
of hardware called a crowbar,

11:00.600 --> 11:02.100
and it punches a back door
through any system

11:02.100 --> 11:03.100
that it's wired into.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.100
Like the thing he used

11:04.100 --> 11:05.270
to hack gideon's servers.

11:05.270 --> 11:08.270
Yes, and that's how
he learned all of his secrets.

11:08.270 --> 11:11.710
That's it. I am gonna rip
this guy a new...

11:11.710 --> 11:13.680
Hey, hey, hey.

11:13.680 --> 11:14.950
Captain, captain.

11:14.950 --> 11:16.710
Computer thing says
you got to lay down.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.520
Look, I don't take orders from
some talking first aid kit.

11:19.520 --> 11:20.520
Besides, a lot of people

11:20.520 --> 11:22.450
got bigger problems
than me right now.

11:22.460 --> 11:24.320
Cap, we need to get you help.
Got you. I got you.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.690
No.

11:26.390 --> 11:27.530
A lot more people gonna get hurt

11:27.530 --> 11:29.390
if we don't figure this out
quick.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.200
1309, squad,
how can we figure out

11:32.200 --> 11:34.130
something to do
with this traffic situation?

11:34.130 --> 11:36.470
Somebody has to get over to
the district transit authority,

11:36.470 --> 11:40.170
find whatever they have
wired into the system,

11:40.170 --> 11:41.670
<i>and...</i>
Smash the hell out of it?

11:41.670 --> 11:43.510
Once again, you read my mind.

11:43.510 --> 11:46.080
All right. I need you two to get
to the district transit office

11:46.080 --> 11:47.410
and do whatever it takes
to get back online.

11:47.410 --> 11:49.750
I'm not leaving the captain.
Hey.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.150
I made my first bust
when you two were in diapers.

11:52.150 --> 11:54.250
Don't make the mistake
of disobeying orders.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.490
Now go.

11:55.490 --> 11:56.590
Come on.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.990
Yes, sir.

11:59.530 --> 12:02.490
Cap, are you sure
you're all right?

12:02.500 --> 12:05.360
As long as you get out there
and shut this guy down,

12:05.360 --> 12:07.060
I'll be just fine.

12:07.070 --> 12:08.500
Take care of him.
- All right?

12:08.500 --> 12:11.570
Damn.

12:16.340 --> 12:17.440
Mr. Reeves...

12:17.440 --> 12:19.110
Oh, good, you're still here.

12:19.110 --> 12:20.950
I was hoping
that you would stick around

12:20.950 --> 12:22.280
to kick us while we're down.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.610
You want to tell me
what's going on?

12:23.620 --> 12:26.680
Be a lot easier to tell you
what's not going on.

12:26.690 --> 12:29.020
Um, we're trying to keep
the entire district

12:29.020 --> 12:30.220
from falling apart.

12:30.220 --> 12:32.790
Your ex is leading the charge.

12:38.130 --> 12:40.530
So, what am I supposed
to tell the mayor?

12:40.530 --> 12:42.800
That he's ugly.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.800
That he's bald. Oh,
how about this? How about this?

12:44.800 --> 12:47.370
Tell him we have
a district-wide cyber attack

12:47.370 --> 12:48.610
on our infrastructure.

12:48.610 --> 12:50.270
And if he knows anything about

12:50.280 --> 12:53.140
massively parallel information
processing systems...

12:53.150 --> 12:54.610
We could use his help.

12:54.610 --> 12:56.210
Otherwise, he should
probably just stick

12:56.220 --> 13:00.450
to pounding his desk
and blaming me for everything.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.160
Goss: <i>Man, I've seen a lot
of Chicago traffic,</i>

13:13.170 --> 13:14.230
<i>but never like this.</i>

13:20.740 --> 13:21.910
You good?

13:23.480 --> 13:25.480
No.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.680
Captain was hurt back there,
and we just walked off.

13:27.680 --> 13:28.950
Just left him.

13:28.950 --> 13:30.450
Because he ordered us to.

13:30.450 --> 13:32.180
Yeah, well, I don't care.
I don't like it.

13:32.190 --> 13:34.020
Don't like any of it.
I can see that.

13:34.020 --> 13:36.650
I screwed up. I saw that car,
I saw it coming.

13:36.660 --> 13:38.690
Just going too fast.
He was going straight

13:38.690 --> 13:40.260
for the captain.
- Oh, come on.

13:40.260 --> 13:42.290
You couldn't have known
that that car...
You don't know that.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.630
You don't know that.
I ju... I froze.

13:44.630 --> 13:46.830
It was a car
going 45 Miles an hour.

13:46.830 --> 13:49.200
I-it was chaos all around.
There was no way...

13:49.200 --> 13:52.040
Which is exactly why I should
have been on my game.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.800
I seen this before. I seen...

13:53.810 --> 13:55.870
I seen this overseas. Some guy,

13:55.880 --> 13:59.440
he gets distracted, can't do
his job, people get hurt.

13:59.450 --> 14:01.280
Brandt, listen to me.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.310
You're not "some guy,"
all right?

14:03.320 --> 14:04.520
You're my partner,

14:04.520 --> 14:06.720
and right now
we got a job to do.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.250
So I'm gonna need you
to pull it together.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.790
Yeah... Roger that.

14:17.330 --> 14:19.800
Squad, we're en route to the
transportation department now.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.570
Copy, 1305. Keep us posted.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.740
All right. I checked
all the police servers.

14:24.740 --> 14:27.070
I didn't find any
crowbars, router taps,

14:27.070 --> 14:29.140
or any other hardware hacks.
All right, all right, good.

14:29.140 --> 14:30.370
Maybe we've at least cleaned up

14:30.380 --> 14:32.240
dv8's digital rat droppings

14:32.250 --> 14:33.510
here at the station.

14:33.510 --> 14:35.580
Hey, murph, how's
it going out there?

14:35.580 --> 14:37.150
We're approaching the area,
squad, but there's gonna be

14:37.150 --> 14:38.480
a hell of a lot of ground
to cover.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.420
Okay. We got more units
on the way.

14:40.420 --> 14:42.590
We're gonna use the drones
as a perimeter.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.960
Copy. The train yard our suspect
identified is up here.

14:52.370 --> 14:53.830
Gideon.

14:53.830 --> 14:56.030
Gideon, the car
just went dead on me.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.040
Gideon:
<i>What? It what?</i>

14:58.040 --> 15:00.170
I repeat, the car is dead.

15:00.170 --> 15:03.010
What? Get...
Get all the body cams up.

15:05.610 --> 15:08.710
<i>1312, squad, we're s.O.L., too.</i>

15:08.710 --> 15:11.380
Oh... how the hell
is he doing this?!
Some kind of remote hack

15:11.380 --> 15:13.450
into our electrical systems.
He did the same thing to me

15:13.450 --> 15:15.590
a few weeks ago.
I thought we were protected

15:15.590 --> 15:16.950
against those kind of hacks.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.460
Once again, under normal
circumstances, we would be.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.620
But I wrote the software.

15:20.630 --> 15:22.060
Danny and I had
the same teacher,

15:22.060 --> 15:24.700
and he knows all of my tricks
and then some.

15:24.700 --> 15:27.900
So... is anyone still rolling
out there?

15:28.740 --> 15:30.870
No, gideon.
He shut them all down.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.020
Murphy, I don't know
what to tell you.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.650
Looks like we've had
a security breach of our own.

15:34.670 --> 15:37.040
If he's coming at us this hard,
we have to be close.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.740
We'll move by foot. Use
the drones to monitor the area.

15:39.740 --> 15:43.510
<i>Let's just get them out.</i>
Okay, we're posting them
at major streets now.

15:49.190 --> 15:51.150
Uh, what the hell?

16:01.730 --> 16:03.530
Gideon, what's going on?

16:03.530 --> 16:05.070
Pete, Pete, Pete.

16:05.070 --> 16:06.900
Uh...

16:06.900 --> 16:09.270
I don't know. I don't know.
Some kind of malfunction.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.410
Oh, I don't like
the look of this.

16:13.410 --> 16:16.280
Yeah. For once, rookie,
I'm with you.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.220
Gideon, is that you?

16:26.660 --> 16:28.760
That is definitely not me!

16:28.760 --> 16:29.960
Get down now!

16:35.460 --> 16:37.000
Gideon, we're under fire.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.500
Gideon: <i>All right, all right.
Can you take cover</i>

16:38.500 --> 16:40.070
<i>in one of the cruisers?</i>

16:42.270 --> 16:44.270
No, we're locked out.

16:44.270 --> 16:47.670
There must be some kind
of stronger control signal

16:47.680 --> 16:49.910
in the area overriding ours.

16:51.850 --> 16:53.680
He's running the whole thing
through an aes algorithm.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.950
He's broken the
signal encryption?

16:55.950 --> 16:59.190
How is dv8 doing any of this?

16:59.190 --> 17:01.520
Gideon, he's the only person
I've ever met

17:01.520 --> 17:04.660
who might be smarter than you.

17:05.589 --> 17:08.260
I need you to do
everything you can

17:08.260 --> 17:10.359
to pinpoint dv8's location.

17:10.369 --> 17:12.700
Pete, let go of that stick.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.000
Earth to Pete!

17:14.000 --> 17:16.640
I need you to get every bit
of jamming equipment we have

17:16.640 --> 17:19.270
into the van right now.

17:25.950 --> 17:28.550
Murphy: <i>Reyes, Cobb,
switch your guns to taser.</i>

17:28.550 --> 17:30.650
Aim for the propellers!

17:30.650 --> 17:31.890
Oh, sure, detective.

17:31.890 --> 17:33.650
Aim for the little
toy helicopter props

17:33.660 --> 17:34.890
a hundred feet away?

17:41.300 --> 17:42.560
They're moving targets.

17:42.570 --> 17:44.300
That's very observant, rookie.

17:44.300 --> 17:47.570
That also makes us
sitting ducks.

17:47.570 --> 17:49.300
All right, enough of this crap.
I'm gonna try

17:49.310 --> 17:51.470
something different.
Cobb!

17:58.810 --> 17:59.810
Go, reyes.

17:59.820 --> 18:00.880
I'll cover you.

18:09.830 --> 18:12.230
Cobb.

18:12.230 --> 18:14.190
What?
- Come on, buddy,
wake up. Wake up.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.360
If you try and give
me mouth-to-mouth,

18:16.370 --> 18:17.600
I'm gonna shoot you myself.

18:21.670 --> 18:26.040
Hold, please. Hold, please.

18:26.040 --> 18:27.870
District 13. Sergeant Charles.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.340
How can I help you?

18:30.350 --> 18:32.080
Oh, yes, sir, Mr. mayor.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.450
Hold one second, please.

18:33.450 --> 18:35.380
Anybody seen gideon?

18:35.380 --> 18:39.290
Hello. I got the
mayor on the line.

18:39.290 --> 18:41.120
Somebody get me gideon Reeves

18:41.120 --> 18:42.290
right now.
- I'll take it.

18:42.290 --> 18:44.460
I'll take it.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.200
Mr. mayor, it's a.S.A. Murphy.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.630
I called for gideon Reeves.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.230
<i>Yeah, I'm aware of that.
He's occupied.</i>

18:52.230 --> 18:55.200
Not for long. I just got off
the phone with judge barnett,

18:55.200 --> 18:56.540
and I've got a court order

18:56.540 --> 18:58.640
authorizing you
to shut him down.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.200
Murphy: <i>Squad,
we're still under attack.</i>

19:01.540 --> 19:03.580
I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.

19:03.580 --> 19:04.810
What the hell does that mean?

19:04.810 --> 19:06.610
Sir, with all due respect,

19:06.620 --> 19:08.650
it sounds like you want
to stop gideon Reeves

19:08.650 --> 19:10.250
more than the hacker
going after him.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.890
Now, that hacker
may be pulling the trigger,

19:11.890 --> 19:14.820
but it's Reeves who put a target
on this city's back.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.490
Now, I want them both gone,
and I want it done now.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.430
<i>Can you make that happen,
Mr. Murphy?</i>

19:20.430 --> 19:22.730
No, sir, I can't.

19:22.730 --> 19:24.900
My son's mother is out there,
and she is in danger.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.100
<i>And right now</i>

19:26.100 --> 19:28.240
gideon Reeves is the only one
that can help her.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.570
So if you want
to shut down the 13th,

19:30.570 --> 19:31.970
you're gonna have to do it
yourself.

19:37.150 --> 19:39.480
That's the sexiest thing
I've seen all day.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.360
Man:
I clearly had the right of way.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.520
That light was green.

19:49.530 --> 19:50.990
How much farther to
transit authority?

19:50.990 --> 19:52.590
About a half hour on foot.

19:52.590 --> 19:54.430
How about we don't do it
on foot? Right here.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.070
Chicago police.

19:59.030 --> 20:01.100
What? Did I do something wrong?

20:01.100 --> 20:02.700
No, sir, but you can
do something right.

20:02.710 --> 20:04.630
Police emergency. We need
to borrow your vehicle.

20:17.490 --> 20:18.650
Oh.

20:18.650 --> 20:21.890
Trying to assemble
delicate electronics back here.

20:21.890 --> 20:24.220
I know, I know. But because
of all the traffic jams,

20:24.230 --> 20:26.830
I'm trying to stick
to the back streets.

20:26.830 --> 20:28.800
I thought I told you
to organize this van.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.500
Why would you put
radio transmitters

20:31.500 --> 20:32.900
next to solenoids?

20:32.900 --> 20:35.400
Because they're
in alphabetical order.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.470
Who puts electronic parts
in alphabetical order?
Seriously?

20:38.470 --> 20:41.410
The same guy who's gonna smash
a chair over his boss' head

20:41.410 --> 20:42.580
if he doesn't quit

20:42.580 --> 20:43.840
yelling at him.

20:43.850 --> 20:46.080
All right, fair enough.

20:57.260 --> 20:59.330
Oh, God.

21:00.930 --> 21:02.600
Okay, okay.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.930
Ah.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.200
What are you doing?

21:05.200 --> 21:07.270
Jamming the control signal

21:07.270 --> 21:09.840
so I can finally land
these bad boys.

21:16.210 --> 21:18.180
Really?
- You're damn right.

21:18.180 --> 21:19.180
All right,

21:19.180 --> 21:21.650
but you owe me 250,000 bucks.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.720
Dv8's got to be pretty close

21:26.720 --> 21:29.890
to be able to break
the encryption on one of these.

21:29.890 --> 21:31.730
Unfortunately, "close"
isn't gonna do us

21:31.730 --> 21:33.190
a whole lot of good right now.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.730
<i>We need an exact location.</i>

21:34.730 --> 21:36.300
I might be able to help you
with that.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.700
<i>If you send me the drone's
radio signal log, I can use it</i>

21:38.700 --> 21:40.400
to find out where
it was being controlled from.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.800
I like it.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.770
<i>He used our tech against us.</i>

21:43.770 --> 21:45.740
<i>It's about damn time</i>

21:45.740 --> 21:47.940
<i>we used his against him.</i>

21:58.550 --> 22:01.990
Okay.
Okay.

22:01.990 --> 22:03.490
Okay, ada.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.930
Now... should be able
to download the information

22:06.930 --> 22:09.600
from the signal that was used
to take down those drones.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.470
Yeah. I'm hooking into our own
network of radio towers now.

22:12.470 --> 22:14.150
I should be able
to find something shortly.

22:16.670 --> 22:18.550
Are you sure you want to depend
on her for this?

22:19.580 --> 22:21.170
Murphy, she can hear you
right now.

22:21.180 --> 22:22.740
I know.

22:22.740 --> 22:24.340
Gideon:
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

22:24.350 --> 22:26.250
<i>She made mistakes.</i>

22:26.250 --> 22:27.850
I get it.

22:27.850 --> 22:29.120
So have I, murph.

22:29.120 --> 22:30.480
Big...

22:30.490 --> 22:33.290
Juicy, terrible mistakes

22:33.290 --> 22:34.790
ever since I took over the 13th.

22:34.790 --> 22:36.090
That's not...
- Look,

22:36.090 --> 22:38.930
I have been disrupting things
all of my life

22:38.930 --> 22:41.030
in the name of success.

22:41.030 --> 22:43.130
Aerospace, robotics...

22:43.130 --> 22:44.870
I forced my kindergarten teacher

22:44.870 --> 22:46.470
into an early retirement.

22:46.470 --> 22:48.840
But you know what every last one

22:48.840 --> 22:50.470
of those successes was built on?

22:50.470 --> 22:51.840
My failures.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.670
I got where I am

22:53.680 --> 22:55.280
because I screwed up, murph.

22:55.280 --> 22:56.780
A whole lot.

22:56.780 --> 22:59.710
<i>I have a successful
rocket company</i>

22:59.720 --> 23:01.980
<i>because I blew up a buttload
of rockets first.</i>

23:01.980 --> 23:04.850
<i>And 'cause people like ada
stuck with me,</i>

23:04.850 --> 23:07.390
<i>even through those mistakes,
all right?</i>

23:07.390 --> 23:09.090
We're still a team.

23:10.530 --> 23:11.730
All right.

23:11.730 --> 23:13.630
I'm with you.
- All right, good.

23:13.630 --> 23:16.130
'Cause it's really
frigging cold out here

23:16.130 --> 23:18.470
and I'm running out of big
speech-y things to say, so...

23:20.240 --> 23:21.900
Ada: <i>Gideon, I think
I found something.</i>

23:21.900 --> 23:23.540
Now that's what I want to hear.

23:23.540 --> 23:24.740
Where is he?

23:24.740 --> 23:26.510
I... that's the problem.

23:26.510 --> 23:29.080
I don't know what kind of
security protocol he's using.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.340
And his transmission signal
seems to be moving.

23:31.350 --> 23:33.380
<i>30 seconds ago
it was coming from Ashland</i>

23:33.380 --> 23:35.920
<i>and now it's coming
from 35th and archer?</i>

23:35.920 --> 23:37.750
What's he using,
some kind of proxy setup?

23:37.750 --> 23:39.190
I mean, if he is,

23:39.190 --> 23:41.420
<i>it's incredibly advanced.</i>

23:41.420 --> 23:43.590
He's on a train.
- What?

23:43.590 --> 23:46.090
He's not using fancy software,
gideon.

23:46.090 --> 23:47.930
He's on the 'l' train.

23:47.930 --> 23:50.300
Ada, was he going
southwest on wabash?

23:51.870 --> 23:53.330
Yeah. Yeah, he's on a train.

23:53.340 --> 23:55.370
Now, see? Team.

23:55.370 --> 23:56.600
Right?

23:56.610 --> 23:57.940
Ada, where can we find this guy?

23:57.940 --> 23:59.670
Okay. If you guys head South,

23:59.680 --> 24:01.940
you can probably intercept him
at the dearborn train yard.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.280
But I'm not gonna be able
to pinpoint him

24:03.280 --> 24:04.540
closer than a few hundred feet.

24:04.550 --> 24:07.110
Gideon:
<i>Okay, one problem at a time.</i>

24:07.120 --> 24:09.450
Everyone, back
to your posts now.

24:09.450 --> 24:11.750
We got work to do.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.750
Ada.
- Hey.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.860
What's the situation?

24:15.860 --> 24:18.630
Um, we might have
a location for Danny reghabi.

24:18.630 --> 24:19.960
Good.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.430
What about Brandt and goss?

24:21.430 --> 24:24.300
Any progress getting the
district moving again?

24:24.300 --> 24:26.070
It's hell out there.

24:26.070 --> 24:28.370
Yes. Th-they're approaching
the transit building now.

24:28.370 --> 24:29.570
Conrad:
1305.

24:29.570 --> 24:30.800
What's your status?

24:30.810 --> 24:33.910
Brandt:
<i>1305, squad.</i>

24:33.910 --> 24:35.110
We had a, uh,
transportation issue,

24:35.110 --> 24:37.780
but, uh, we worked it out.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.550
Yeah, but it looks
like the d-21 cops

24:39.550 --> 24:42.180
already beat us to the punch.

24:45.550 --> 24:47.150
Hey. What's going on?

24:47.160 --> 24:48.960
Security guard got killed.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.560
Bullet to the back of the head.

24:53.260 --> 24:56.060
<i>Squad, district 21 is on-site
investigating a homicide.</i>

24:56.060 --> 24:57.330
<i>We're definitely
in the right place,</i>

24:57.330 --> 24:59.230
<i>but we got no idea
what we're looking for.</i>

24:59.230 --> 25:00.770
Okay. What you're looking for

25:00.770 --> 25:02.000
is a telecom center.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.270
It's gonna be away
from the computers.

25:04.270 --> 25:05.910
It's a place where
sensitive electronics

25:05.910 --> 25:07.340
are wired up for transmission.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.140
It's probably where dv8
was able to hack

25:09.140 --> 25:10.840
with a small piece of hardware.

25:10.850 --> 25:12.850
You sure he hasn't tapped
into their computer?

25:12.850 --> 25:14.250
No. The system is fine.

25:14.250 --> 25:15.520
It's just that the, uh, signal

25:15.520 --> 25:17.120
keeps getting hijacked
before it can make its way

25:17.120 --> 25:18.590
to the transportation grid.

25:18.590 --> 25:21.190
<i>Honey, I understand about
a third of what you just said.</i>

25:21.190 --> 25:22.920
Just tell me where
we're supposed to look.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.660
I'm thinking if he killed
a security guard,

25:24.660 --> 25:26.690
he must've needed
to get inside the building,

25:26.700 --> 25:29.160
which means he's not doing
anything on the ground floor.

25:34.470 --> 25:36.500
There's a hell of a lot
of crap up there.

25:36.510 --> 25:39.470
Yup, which means a hell of a lot
of ways to mess stuff up.

25:39.470 --> 25:40.870
Let's go.

25:42.380 --> 25:44.310
1309, what's your 20?

25:44.310 --> 25:46.050
Gideon:
<i>We're getting close, squad.</i>

25:46.050 --> 25:48.180
All right, my access
to the district transpo system

25:48.180 --> 25:51.050
is limited, but my best guess
is that you're looking for

25:51.050 --> 25:53.820
the train that came in
on track 7.

25:53.820 --> 25:57.290
That train is scheduled to make
a stop for a track change...

25:57.290 --> 25:59.790
<i>Now. I-is there any way
that you guys can make it?</i>

25:59.800 --> 26:01.190
Murphy:
Already did.

26:04.700 --> 26:05.970
There, there.

26:09.740 --> 26:12.470
It's got to be that one, right?

26:12.470 --> 26:14.540
All right, listen up,
we need to be careful.

26:14.540 --> 26:16.410
This guy's been working on
killing us since yesterday.

26:16.410 --> 26:18.650
We give him another shot,
he's not gonna hesitate.

26:18.650 --> 26:20.080
Ada: <i>Okay, guys,
according to the system,</i>

26:20.080 --> 26:22.020
this track change
doesn't take very long,

26:22.020 --> 26:23.220
so you don't have much time.

26:23.220 --> 26:24.480
<i>You have to get a move on.</i>

26:24.490 --> 26:26.410
Right, 'cause we've been
standing around all day?

26:30.090 --> 26:31.460
Go!

26:42.270 --> 26:43.370
Murphy:
This car's empty.

26:43.370 --> 26:44.500
Head for the side door.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.880
Go, go, go!
Come on.

26:51.050 --> 26:52.150
All aboard.

27:01.460 --> 27:04.220
Brandt: <i>She was right,
there's a hell of a lot</i>

27:04.230 --> 27:05.230
of gak up here.

27:05.230 --> 27:07.360
Goss:
"High voltage, keep out"?

27:07.360 --> 27:08.800
You got to be kidding me.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.700
Ada didn't say anything
about getting fried to death.

27:12.700 --> 27:16.440
Now, what are we
looking for, exactly?

27:16.440 --> 27:18.540
Something that looks like
it doesn't belong in there.

27:24.780 --> 27:27.910
Hey. Hey.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.450
You with me?

27:29.450 --> 27:30.750
Yeah.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.820
Those are a lot of wires.

27:32.820 --> 27:34.620
I don't even know
where to start.

27:36.290 --> 27:38.060
Wait, what's that?

27:38.060 --> 27:39.490
Right there, come here.

27:39.490 --> 27:40.560
You see that?

27:41.500 --> 27:42.900
Is that it?

27:42.900 --> 27:45.270
This is not good,
we got to call somebody,

27:45.270 --> 27:46.330
the power company, or...

27:46.330 --> 27:47.600
We don't have that kind of time,

27:47.600 --> 27:48.920
people are getting
hurt out there.

27:51.110 --> 27:53.270
Uh... okay.

27:53.280 --> 27:54.910
All right, all right, I'm on it.

27:54.910 --> 27:58.810
Now, it looks like the only way
through is-is right here,

27:58.810 --> 28:01.080
but I don't-I don't have eyes
on the damn thing.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.120
No, no, no, no,
I can see it from here.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.520
But you're gonna have
to make the reach,

28:04.520 --> 28:05.750
my arms aren't long enough.

28:05.750 --> 28:06.750
Are you serious?

28:06.760 --> 28:08.250
I can guide you.

28:09.620 --> 28:11.660
Look, we can do this, Brandt.

28:11.660 --> 28:13.860
This is what the captain
ordered us to do.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.430
Look, come on, man,
the longer we wait,

28:15.430 --> 28:17.660
the worse it's gonna get
out there. Come on.

28:18.630 --> 28:21.100
Yeah, yeah.

28:26.540 --> 28:28.880
Okay, uh...

28:28.880 --> 28:31.540
Lower your hand
about half an inch.

28:31.550 --> 28:33.210
A little higher.

28:33.220 --> 28:35.550
Oh, stay-stay to the right,
stay to the right.

28:35.550 --> 28:36.550
Whoa, whoa, watch the wires.

28:36.550 --> 28:38.380
Watch the wi...

28:38.390 --> 28:39.490
Damn it!

28:39.490 --> 28:40.490
Ah!

28:40.490 --> 28:42.160
Brandt, you okay?

28:43.160 --> 28:44.720
Hey, hey.

28:46.290 --> 28:47.990
You can do this.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.800
You can do this.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.470
Yeah.

28:54.740 --> 28:55.800
Okay.

28:57.370 --> 28:59.240
Okay.

29:03.250 --> 29:04.410
You got me?

29:04.410 --> 29:05.950
I got you.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.920
Whoa, stay to the right.

29:11.920 --> 29:12.990
There.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.260
Uh, little higher.

29:16.260 --> 29:17.590
There.

29:17.590 --> 29:19.160
That's good, you're touching it.

29:21.030 --> 29:22.230
You got it.

29:24.100 --> 29:25.100
Yes!

29:25.100 --> 29:27.600
Ah!

29:29.100 --> 29:30.100
Ah!

29:33.210 --> 29:34.940
1305, squad.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.040
Be advised, the
transmitter's been located

29:37.050 --> 29:39.180
<i>and neutralized.</i>

29:41.120 --> 29:42.180
Ada: Yes!

29:50.030 --> 29:51.690
We have any idea
where this guy is?

29:54.230 --> 29:56.830
He has to be
in one of these cars.

30:00.870 --> 30:03.300
How are we covering each other
going through these doors?

30:03.310 --> 30:05.810
I didn't say
it was gonna be easy.

30:05.810 --> 30:07.810
You wait back here, gideon.

30:07.810 --> 30:09.980
I'm pretty much all-in
on this one, murph.

30:09.980 --> 30:11.640
Hey, uh, ada?

30:11.650 --> 30:13.480
I need you to get
the cruisers to us

30:13.480 --> 30:14.910
<i>soon as they're back online.</i>

30:14.920 --> 30:17.320
<i>Oh, tell Pete to get me
the jammer.</i>

30:17.320 --> 30:19.220
<i>We're gonna need
everything we got.</i>

30:19.220 --> 30:21.320
Yeah, without access
to his system,

30:21.320 --> 30:22.760
that's not gonna do us
much good.

30:22.760 --> 30:23.820
<i>Huh.</i>

30:23.830 --> 30:26.730
I think maybe
I can help with that.

30:32.900 --> 30:33.900
Gideon, wait.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.640
No, no, no, no time to wait.

30:35.640 --> 30:39.010
Okay, got his computers, yes.

30:39.010 --> 30:41.370
So, looks like
a wireless transmission system.

30:46.410 --> 30:48.680
Well, look who's here.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.680
Uh-uh.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.520
That's enough.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.190
Screw you.

30:54.260 --> 30:55.360
Screw you.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.930
You like it? It's
called a hot suit.

30:59.930 --> 31:01.530
A lot of power company
guys wear them

31:01.530 --> 31:03.100
when they're working
on the lines.

31:03.100 --> 31:04.960
The metal threading
helps protect you

31:04.970 --> 31:06.300
from high voltage shock.

31:06.300 --> 31:08.130
Oh, also cops who
think they can trust

31:08.140 --> 31:09.700
a fascist billionaire's tech.

31:09.700 --> 31:10.700
Danny?

31:10.710 --> 31:12.810
I prefer dv8, thanks.

31:12.810 --> 31:14.440
And whatever you're
about to tell me about

31:14.440 --> 31:17.140
putting my gun down or not
making this worse for myself,

31:17.150 --> 31:18.540
you can save your breath.

31:18.550 --> 31:20.610
Drop your guns.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.480
Or the genius mind
of gideon Reeves

31:24.490 --> 31:26.290
gets splattered
all over this train.

31:37.230 --> 31:39.230
Gideon:
Okay, so...

31:39.230 --> 31:41.030
Just tell us what you want.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.240
Oh, my friend,
that list is long.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.470
Well, you don't have much time.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.070
What do you think, you're
just gonna just ride

31:46.070 --> 31:47.640
in this train forever?

31:47.640 --> 31:49.240
You think we're actually
gonna let you shoot him

31:49.240 --> 31:50.240
and just walk away?

31:50.250 --> 31:51.510
We're not gonna let you do that.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.050
The thing is, you're not
really in a great position

31:54.050 --> 31:55.580
to bargain, officer Murphy.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.480
And I've got myself
a few billion dollars' worth

31:57.490 --> 31:58.920
of hostage here.

31:58.920 --> 32:01.350
Captain, you're needed
at the front desk.
Not now.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.490
It's urgent, sir,
the FBI is here.

32:08.100 --> 32:11.100
Ada, I'll be back soon as I can.

32:11.100 --> 32:12.830
Okay, yeah.

32:14.270 --> 32:16.370
Murphy, is there any way
you can buy some time?

32:16.370 --> 32:17.840
I think I can stop the train.

32:19.340 --> 32:20.440
Okay.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.610
Let's just... let's
just calm down.

32:23.610 --> 32:25.040
You have all the power here,

32:25.050 --> 32:27.110
so why don't you just
tell us how this goes?

32:27.120 --> 32:29.580
Yeah.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.350
Let's talk like rational...

32:31.350 --> 32:33.290
Okay, maybe not
rational, all right?

32:33.290 --> 32:34.450
Intelligent, yes?

32:34.460 --> 32:35.960
Let's talk like
intelligent human beings.

32:35.960 --> 32:37.360
Unbelievable.
- What?

32:37.360 --> 32:38.790
Even with a gun to your head,

32:38.790 --> 32:40.460
you can't keep
your smart mouth shut?

32:40.460 --> 32:43.960
This whole 13th district
experiment, it ends today.

32:43.970 --> 32:46.070
In fact, it's already started.

32:46.070 --> 32:47.570
So, ada, if you're watching,

32:47.570 --> 32:50.540
<i>tell the feds I say hi.</i>

32:51.810 --> 32:53.570
Conrad: What the hell do
you think you're doing?

32:53.580 --> 32:55.480
We have a warrant
for her arrest.

32:55.480 --> 32:58.080
Look, she is in the middle
of dealing

32:58.080 --> 32:59.410
with a hostage situation.

32:59.410 --> 33:01.150
And we're in the middle
of an investigation.

33:01.150 --> 33:02.580
We have information
she was involved

33:02.580 --> 33:03.850
in multiple federal crimes.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.090
I'm telling you,

33:06.090 --> 33:08.550
we have an authorization
and a warrant.

33:08.560 --> 33:10.320
Conrad: Look, this
is my personnel here.

33:10.330 --> 33:11.590
This is my district!

33:12.990 --> 33:14.060
What did you do?

33:14.060 --> 33:16.160
I held her accountable,
that's all.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.300
Now, you're angry with me.

33:19.300 --> 33:20.500
Why punish ada?

33:20.500 --> 33:22.770
<i>'Cause she's just as guilty
as you are.</i>

33:22.770 --> 33:24.000
<i>Maybe even more so.</i>

33:24.010 --> 33:26.340
<i>She was one of us</i>

33:26.340 --> 33:28.140
before she started
helping you turn this city

33:28.140 --> 33:30.540
into your own
little police state.

33:32.910 --> 33:34.310
Murphy:
<i>Please, ada.</i>

33:34.320 --> 33:35.780
I'm trying to get into
the transportation computers.

33:35.780 --> 33:37.650
I'm working as fast as I can.

33:39.690 --> 33:42.420
You're interfering in a case.
You're putting lives in danger.

33:42.420 --> 33:45.530
She is in direct violation
of a federal plea agreement.

33:45.530 --> 33:47.590
Are you sure you want to thump
your badge at us?

33:53.370 --> 33:55.370
Look, we're far from perfect.

33:55.370 --> 33:56.700
But we're trying
to protect people.

33:56.700 --> 33:58.200
Is that right?

33:58.210 --> 34:00.110
Well, today
they're gonna find out

34:00.110 --> 34:02.140
just how well-protected
they are.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.540
They're all gonna know.

34:03.550 --> 34:04.640
How, exactly?

34:04.650 --> 34:05.710
Let's just say there's gonna be

34:05.710 --> 34:07.780
a little demonstration
of just how powerless

34:07.780 --> 34:10.650
the mighty 13th district
really is, detective.

34:10.650 --> 34:11.820
Look, you don't need to do this.

34:11.820 --> 34:13.850
One more step and he dies.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.159
- Conrad:
Okay, wait, hold on, hold on.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.360
I need to talk...
Adelaide Hamilton.

34:26.730 --> 34:27.800
You're under arrest.

34:27.800 --> 34:30.040
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
God, come on.

34:39.909 --> 34:42.080
Drop it!
You're under arrest.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.150
And I'm not in taser mode,
smart-ass.

34:46.350 --> 34:47.920
You got him?

34:47.920 --> 34:49.790
Yeah. But now
we have to stop him.

34:56.100 --> 34:58.830
Murphy:
Just sit your ass right there.
We're not through with you yet.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.500
What are all these for?
- Okay,

35:00.500 --> 35:02.500
without ada here to help me
sort it out, I'm not sure.

35:02.500 --> 35:05.370
But this one was
disabling the cruisers

35:05.370 --> 35:08.370
and I got those back online.
A lot of this stuff here

35:08.380 --> 35:10.180
looks like it was for

35:10.180 --> 35:11.280
hacking the drones.

35:11.280 --> 35:12.510
And the rest?

35:12.510 --> 35:15.180
Well, that's what
I'm worried about.

35:15.180 --> 35:16.550
This one.

35:16.550 --> 35:18.120
There's mapping software

35:18.120 --> 35:20.620
and some sort of...

35:20.620 --> 35:22.020
Servo control

35:22.020 --> 35:23.690
mechanism?
I-I...

35:23.690 --> 35:24.720
Meaning?

35:24.730 --> 35:25.960
It's for...

35:25.960 --> 35:28.490
Remotely controlling devices.

35:30.030 --> 35:31.360
Oh, my God.

35:31.370 --> 35:33.030
Look at this.

35:35.140 --> 35:37.970
It's targeting software
for an automated weapon.

35:37.970 --> 35:40.110
What? Where is it?

35:40.110 --> 35:41.370
Uh...

35:41.380 --> 35:42.640
Hard to be 100% sure.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.240
The mapping overlay
is for downtown.

35:44.250 --> 35:46.980
That's between
wacker and Michigan.

35:46.980 --> 35:48.650
Gideon, that's where
city hall is.

35:50.250 --> 35:52.080
Can we stop it?

35:52.090 --> 35:54.750
No. No, it's...

35:54.760 --> 35:56.490
It's an automated program.

35:56.490 --> 35:58.820
It would take too long
to break the encryption.

35:58.830 --> 36:01.490
Then we'll break him.

36:01.500 --> 36:04.000
We found your little surprise.
Turn it off now.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.560
Why on earth would I do that?

36:05.570 --> 36:06.900
Don't dig yourself
a deeper hole.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.600
Oh, the hole isn't mine.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.770
It's a grave
for the 13th district.

36:11.770 --> 36:14.110
I've thought a lot about this,
Mr. Reeves,

36:14.110 --> 36:16.310
how to end
your experiment for good.

36:16.310 --> 36:17.510
Nobody seems to mind

36:17.510 --> 36:20.080
the cops killing
innocent people.

36:20.080 --> 36:22.520
But I think a bloody corpse
or two at city hall

36:22.520 --> 36:23.820
might shake everybody's faith

36:23.820 --> 36:26.420
in the gideon Reeves revolution,
don't you?

36:27.360 --> 36:29.690
Please. You've made your point.

36:29.690 --> 36:31.460
No, I haven't.

36:31.460 --> 36:34.590
Not until I bring
your brave new world

36:34.600 --> 36:35.930
to an end.

36:35.930 --> 36:37.800
Murphy:
He's stalling.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.930
We need to get to downtown
before it's too late.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.700
Enjoy the show.

37:25.850 --> 37:27.580
Wait, this is an emerg...

37:27.580 --> 37:29.320
What are they saying?

37:31.250 --> 37:32.920
I'm listening to hold music.

37:32.920 --> 37:35.350
Scott: Look, I'm just
trying to say, Mr. mayor,

37:35.360 --> 37:37.260
now may not be the best time
for a press conference.

37:37.260 --> 37:38.920
Salgado: Oh, it's the perfect
time. Take a look at this.

37:38.930 --> 37:41.760
The city council
just authorized that injunction.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.200
The 12th district
is taking over the 13th.

37:44.200 --> 37:48.100
Listen, I was there.
I saw exactly what's going on.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.370
And I saw gideon trying to help.

37:50.370 --> 37:52.610
He's trying to clean up
a mess that he made.

37:52.610 --> 37:53.710
Aide:
Mr. mayor? Mr. mayor,

37:53.710 --> 37:55.540
I have gideon Reeves
on the phone for you, sir.

37:55.540 --> 37:58.180
Oh, speak of the bastard
and he pops up.

37:58.180 --> 38:01.110
Hey, Reeves. Perfect timing,
I was just about to go outside

38:01.120 --> 38:02.780
and tell your friends
in the press

38:02.780 --> 38:04.050
that we're shutting you down.

38:04.050 --> 38:06.390
Whatever you are doing,
cancel it.

38:06.390 --> 38:07.620
You are in danger.

38:07.620 --> 38:09.890
Nice try, Mr. Reeves.

38:09.890 --> 38:11.520
I'm serious. You can't...

38:11.530 --> 38:14.530
Uh, yes, I ca...
Listen, you son of a bitch,

38:14.530 --> 38:16.960
I know that you think that
your money gives you the right

38:16.960 --> 38:18.860
to tell everybody
in this town what to do,

38:18.870 --> 38:22.130
but I'm here to tell you
that you are sorely mistaken.

38:22.140 --> 38:24.040
No, no, no,
this is not about me!

38:24.040 --> 38:26.140
Oh, it's all about you,
Mr. Reeves.

38:26.140 --> 38:29.280
It's about you finally
getting what you deserve.

38:32.210 --> 38:34.650
I don't... ah...

38:34.650 --> 38:36.480
What happened?

38:36.480 --> 38:39.020
The asshat hung up on me!

38:44.090 --> 38:46.830
Gideon, we're not getting
anywhere with this traffic.

38:46.830 --> 38:49.060
All right, give me one sec.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.660
Squad, this is gideon.
Conrad, you there?

38:51.670 --> 38:53.000
Conrad:
<i>What's left of me.</i>

38:53.000 --> 38:54.770
Captain, we need
to get to city hall.

38:54.770 --> 38:56.670
Lights and sirens
are not gonna cut it.

38:56.670 --> 38:58.470
I hear you,
but without ada around...

38:58.470 --> 38:59.840
Gideon:
<i>I know, I know.</i>

38:59.840 --> 39:01.340
<i>Just go to her computer.</i>

39:01.340 --> 39:02.580
Gideon, I can't...

39:02.580 --> 39:03.840
<i>You have to.</i>

39:03.850 --> 39:05.080
We got to clear this traffic.

39:05.080 --> 39:06.510
There's no other way.

39:06.510 --> 39:09.850
Listen, I... I can barely
check my e-mails, much less...

39:09.850 --> 39:11.450
<i>All right, well,</i>

39:11.450 --> 39:13.350
I'm gonna talk you through it.
Okay, she's already in

39:13.350 --> 39:15.450
the-the transportation
department interface.

39:15.460 --> 39:17.190
Tell me what's up

39:17.190 --> 39:18.360
Uh,

39:18.360 --> 39:20.360
"rail system emergency braking."

39:20.360 --> 39:22.630

Thank you for coming.

40:21.160 --> 40:23.090
As I'm sure you know,

40:23.090 --> 40:26.690
this has been a difficult day
for the city of Chicago.

40:26.690 --> 40:29.090
And we'll be sorting out
exactly what happened

40:29.100 --> 40:30.860
for some time to come.

40:30.870 --> 40:34.270
But right now one thing
is painfully clear:

40:34.270 --> 40:36.540
The technological experiment

40:36.540 --> 40:38.770
launched in our 13th district

40:38.770 --> 40:40.840
by billionaire gideon Reeves

40:40.840 --> 40:43.140
has failed.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.850
What are you doing?
The drones...

40:49.850 --> 40:52.280
Gideon: No, no, no,
it's not for the drones.

40:52.290 --> 40:54.020
Then what?

40:54.020 --> 40:56.620
Reeves has talked about...

40:56.620 --> 40:59.260
Making our city safer.

40:59.260 --> 41:01.960
The trouble is,

41:01.960 --> 41:03.900
his own ego,

41:03.900 --> 41:06.300
his own arrogance

41:06.300 --> 41:07.900
has gotten in the way.

41:07.900 --> 41:10.700
All right, this jams
electrical signals, right?

41:10.710 --> 41:13.040
So, dv8 has an automated
sniper rifle out there.

41:13.040 --> 41:14.540
If I can scramble
the electronics,

41:14.540 --> 41:15.980
I might be able to stop it.

41:15.980 --> 41:18.480
But I just need to remove
the regulator circuits,

41:18.480 --> 41:21.080
so it transmits a wider
range of frequencies.

41:21.080 --> 41:24.150
Just spare me the details and
make sure you fry that thing.

41:24.150 --> 41:27.920
Reeves talks about improvements,

41:27.920 --> 41:30.260
he talks about revolution,

41:30.260 --> 41:33.060
he talks about disruption.

41:33.060 --> 41:34.930
But where does he talk about

41:34.930 --> 41:40.570
the people impacted
by his reckless reforms?

41:40.570 --> 41:42.600
Sure, the world is changing,

41:42.600 --> 41:44.500
and change is good.

41:44.510 --> 41:46.340
But what happens

41:46.340 --> 41:49.710
when that change is too fast?
