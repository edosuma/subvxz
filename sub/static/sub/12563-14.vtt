00:22.955 --> 00:24.372
Bam.

00:24.374 --> 00:27.325
Is there anything
you don't do well at the beach?

00:29.596 --> 00:31.046
Not in front of your brother.

00:31.048 --> 00:32.830
Nah, he's in CFO mode.

00:32.832 --> 00:34.132
He can't process anything

00:34.134 --> 00:35.684
but high-limit credit cards right now.

00:35.686 --> 00:37.102
Is that... hold...

00:37.104 --> 00:39.054
yeah, we take AmEx, Visa,
Mastercard, and Discovery, Henry.

00:39.056 --> 00:40.639
And make sure you mention
our affinity program too.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.274
I'm on it. I rest my case.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.608
So, do you play?

00:43.610 --> 00:45.527
Beach volleyball? I'm okay.

00:45.529 --> 00:47.112
Just okay?

00:47.114 --> 00:48.446
I know, you like to be challenged.

00:48.448 --> 00:51.149
Good, okay. Okay, bye.

00:51.151 --> 00:52.901
Where'd our potential clients go?

00:52.903 --> 00:54.619
They're coming back with friends.

00:54.621 --> 00:57.572
Oh, there was nobody.

00:57.574 --> 00:59.124
What're you guys talking about over here?

00:59.126 --> 01:00.858
Besides sex on the beach?

01:02.212 --> 01:04.162
We were discussing Harper's
mad volleyball skills.

01:04.164 --> 01:06.665
Really? You have
mad volleyball skills, huh?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.833
It's the official sport
at my family reunion.

01:08.835 --> 01:10.868
And this year's reunion is this weekend.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.253
So I should try to get some practice in.

01:12.255 --> 01:13.421
Cool.

01:13.423 --> 01:14.923
What are the unofficial sports?

01:14.925 --> 01:17.041
We like our bocce ball beer fest.

01:17.043 --> 01:20.178
And our parcheesi pizza contest
gets downright ugly

01:20.180 --> 01:22.063
when grandma's
competitive streak comes out.

01:22.065 --> 01:23.715
Oh, my God, you should totally bring Hank.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.150
Wait, wait, wait, Ev...

01:25.152 --> 01:26.718
Dude, you're the parcheesiest
person I've ever met.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.486
My family would love to meet you.

01:28.488 --> 01:30.188
Really?

01:30.190 --> 01:32.490
Well, I do know my way
around a parcheesi board.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.242
You also know your way around a grandma.

01:34.244 --> 01:35.643
You can total... that sounds really weird.

01:35.645 --> 01:38.062
- Yeah.
- Okeydokey.

01:38.064 --> 01:39.664
So, you're in?

01:39.666 --> 01:42.417
Yeah. I'm in.

01:42.419 --> 01:45.837
Awesome. I'll call home
and add you to the guest list.

01:45.839 --> 01:50.074
Perfect.

01:50.076 --> 01:52.961
- I'm so sorry.
- About what?

01:52.963 --> 01:54.579
I just threw you under the bus, man.

01:54.581 --> 01:57.682
I... I threw you
on the bus to Kubelickville.

01:57.684 --> 02:00.852
I... want to be
on the bus to Kubelickville.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.188
Yeah, meeting her family
doesn't freak me out at all.

02:03.190 --> 02:05.306
You really like this girl, huh?

02:05.308 --> 02:06.608
I do.

02:06.610 --> 02:08.393
Oh, my God.

02:08.395 --> 02:11.529
I have the perfect luggage for your trip.

02:14.316 --> 02:15.533
Are you ready for this?

02:15.535 --> 02:16.985
I am so ready for it.

02:16.987 --> 02:19.871
- Here you go.
- Okay.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.439
- Oh.
- It's your new Hank bag.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.742
To replace the other one.
The one that you left...

02:23.744 --> 02:25.377
Wherever the hell it is
you went last week.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.712
You like it?

02:27.714 --> 02:29.013
Well, I won't have to introduce myself.

02:29.015 --> 02:30.114
I know.

02:30.116 --> 02:31.449
It's fine for now.

02:32.452 --> 02:33.951
Hankmed. How can I make you
feel better today?

02:33.953 --> 02:34.919
Yes.

02:41.310 --> 02:42.960
Here. Try this.

02:42.962 --> 02:44.729
Oh, hey, thanks a lot.

02:44.731 --> 02:46.147
I hope the official water boy
isn't around.

02:46.149 --> 02:47.565
I don't want to step on any toes.

02:49.569 --> 02:52.320
Hans, let's take five.

02:52.322 --> 02:53.571
- I'm Cameron Krissy.
- Hank.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.023
Nice to meet you, Ha...

02:55.025 --> 02:57.642
Yeah, you too.

02:57.644 --> 03:01.029
- Here you go, Cam.
- Oh, thanks.

03:01.031 --> 03:02.080
Look, I'm a doctor,

03:02.082 --> 03:03.665
and that sounds pretty bad.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.049
You may need something
stronger than water.

03:05.051 --> 03:07.085
Well, I'll take something later.

03:07.087 --> 03:08.203
Can't stop now.

03:08.205 --> 03:09.821
Spoken like a true pro.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.339
Oh, I'm not a pro.

03:11.341 --> 03:13.208
I coach at a junior college in Arizona.

03:13.210 --> 03:14.759
You're trying to go pro.

03:14.761 --> 03:17.212
And just a few qualifying
points away from doing it.

03:17.214 --> 03:19.214
Which is why you're here.

03:19.216 --> 03:21.433
That and the chance
to work with actual pros.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.435
Like Jessica Slater and Aubrey Powers.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.636
And you?

03:24.638 --> 03:26.805
I'm just here for the potential injuries.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.307
The tournament doc had to
drop out at the last second.

03:29.309 --> 03:31.509
I almost had to do the same thing.

03:31.511 --> 03:34.062
My partner quit volleyball
a few weeks ago.

03:34.064 --> 03:37.282
I had to scramble to find
a replacement for her.

03:37.284 --> 03:38.733
Is the replacement any good?

03:38.735 --> 03:42.203
She's fine. For now.

03:42.205 --> 03:44.689
Huh. Well, I can't help you with that,

03:44.691 --> 03:47.325
but call if the cough doesn't improve.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.359
Thanks.

04:15.321 --> 04:20.057
Are you nervous?

04:20.059 --> 04:21.358
A little bit.

04:21.361 --> 04:24.913
I've never done a photo shoot like this.

04:24.915 --> 04:26.247
Well, you will be great.

04:26.249 --> 04:27.949
And you'll have
all that support around you.

04:27.951 --> 04:30.118
And the photographers,

04:30.120 --> 04:32.453
the publicists, the magazine staff.

04:32.455 --> 04:35.406
And, of course, Georgette.

04:35.408 --> 04:37.208
Who?

04:37.210 --> 04:39.294
The supermodel I'm posing with.

04:39.296 --> 04:41.763
I'll be leaning on her for support.

04:41.765 --> 04:46.134
Among other things.

04:55.528 --> 04:58.613
Slater back to serve.

04:58.615 --> 05:00.431
Right here. Got it.

05:00.433 --> 05:04.268
- Get it, get it!
- Right here.

05:04.270 --> 05:05.820
Wow, wow!

05:05.822 --> 05:08.623
So, these ladies mean business.

05:08.625 --> 05:10.775
Hank, all ladies mean business.

05:10.777 --> 05:11.960
I'll keep that in mind

05:11.962 --> 05:13.444
when I take your grandma down
in parcheesi.

05:13.446 --> 05:15.613
Try talking that smack to her face.

05:15.615 --> 05:17.749
No, I'm really looking forward to it.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.250
Me too.

05:19.252 --> 05:21.285
High line by Powers.

05:21.287 --> 05:23.321
Great play out of the net!

05:23.323 --> 05:27.592
Nice! Oh, nice!

05:27.594 --> 05:29.227
Great set. Hey, great set.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.562
Aubrey, Aubrey.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.679
What's wrong?

05:31.681 --> 05:33.598
- Aah.
- Hey, can we get a medic?

05:33.600 --> 05:34.732
Yeah, coming in.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.517
Excuse me.

05:36.519 --> 05:37.769
Take it easy.

05:37.771 --> 05:41.272
Take it easy. Relax, relax.

05:41.274 --> 05:42.273
Hey. Hey, Aubrey.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.025
It's okay.

05:44.027 --> 05:45.526
What happened?

05:45.528 --> 05:47.912
My legs just gave out, like jell-o.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.497
Rapid breathing, no wheezing.

05:49.499 --> 05:51.148
Hank, is there anything I can do?

05:51.150 --> 05:52.500
Yes. Call 911.

05:52.502 --> 05:54.786
Okay.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.588
- Aubrey, do you have asthma?
- No.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.755
How 'bout any allergies?

05:57.757 --> 05:58.957
Just a lot of pain.

05:58.959 --> 06:02.927
- Where is the pain?
- Everywhere.

06:24.143 --> 06:27.643
Royal Pains 4x14 - Sand Legs

Sync and corrections by atrn97g

06:31.209 --> 06:33.010
Aunt Aubrey, are you okay?

06:33.012 --> 06:35.363
Yes, sweetie, but can you
get your mom for me?

06:35.365 --> 06:38.449
Okay.

06:38.451 --> 06:40.568
Shortness of breath,
dehydration, and pain.

06:40.570 --> 06:42.570
This could be sickle-cell anemia.

06:42.572 --> 06:45.456
I need to get a line going fast.

06:47.544 --> 06:49.327
Does your family have
a history of sickle-cell?

06:49.329 --> 06:50.912
Not that I know of.

06:50.914 --> 06:53.998
I'm not getting anything.
Try the other arm.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.667
You may have the trait
without the full-blown disease.

06:55.669 --> 06:57.001
During heavy activity,

06:57.003 --> 06:58.703
it can cause what's called
"exertional sickling."

06:58.705 --> 07:00.171
This never happened to me before.

07:00.173 --> 07:01.923
The first episode can occur anytime.

07:01.925 --> 07:03.808
Her veins are collapsed from dehydration.

07:03.810 --> 07:05.593
Ambulance will be here in five.

07:05.595 --> 07:07.211
What else can I do?

07:07.213 --> 07:08.546
I need that official's platform.

07:08.548 --> 07:10.481
Okay.

07:10.483 --> 07:12.400
Without fluid or resuscitation,

07:12.402 --> 07:14.519
she could go into rhabdomyolisis
before the ambulance gets here.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.020
What's the platform for?

07:16.022 --> 07:17.788
If we can invert her, gravity
will distend the neck vein

07:17.790 --> 07:19.107
so I can get a line into the jugular.

07:19.109 --> 07:20.992
Come here, guys. Bring it over here.

07:20.994 --> 07:22.744
Right up to her feet. That's it.

07:22.746 --> 07:23.945
Line it up with her.

07:23.947 --> 07:26.581
Okay, good.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.282
All right, everybody grab a limb.

07:28.284 --> 07:29.784
And let's lift. One, two, three, lift.

07:29.786 --> 07:31.703
And feet up.

07:31.705 --> 07:32.670
Feet-first, that's it.

07:32.672 --> 07:34.672
Slide her up all the way.

07:34.674 --> 07:38.793
Okay, perfect.

07:38.795 --> 07:43.431
Harper, I need you to prep
saline and a thin strip of tape.

07:43.433 --> 07:46.851
Let me see. Yeah, there it is.

07:46.853 --> 07:49.887
Just cleaning your neck.

07:49.889 --> 07:54.559
Now, you're gonna feel a slight pinch.

07:54.561 --> 07:57.145
Okay, line, please.

07:57.147 --> 07:58.946
Thank you.

08:00.699 --> 08:03.234
Secure. Tape.

08:03.236 --> 08:06.437
Thank you.

08:06.439 --> 08:09.907
Okay, excellent.

08:09.909 --> 08:11.826
The ambulance should be here soon.

08:11.828 --> 08:13.494
The paramedics will give you oxygen

08:13.496 --> 08:15.046
and something for the pain.

08:15.048 --> 08:17.749
Okay, we got it.

08:17.751 --> 08:19.167
Aubrey, you're gonna be okay.

08:19.169 --> 08:20.168
She's gonna be okay.

08:20.170 --> 08:23.054
Thanks for your help.

09:05.214 --> 09:09.100
Looking for me having a drink?

09:09.102 --> 09:12.353
No, I... I, um... I was just...

09:12.355 --> 09:13.871
it's nice to see you, Paige.

09:13.873 --> 09:16.507
It's nice to see you too.

09:16.509 --> 09:18.943
That's a pretty color.

09:18.945 --> 09:20.778
Special occasion?

09:20.780 --> 09:22.113
No, I just like waddling around town,

09:22.115 --> 09:23.698
not being able to touch anything.

09:23.700 --> 09:26.016
With a stone like that,

09:26.018 --> 09:27.919
I wouldn't touch anything with dry nails.

09:27.921 --> 09:30.538
- Is that an antique?
- Lawson family heirloom.

09:30.540 --> 09:33.407
Have you and Evan set a date yet?

09:33.409 --> 09:34.909
Next Christmas.

09:34.911 --> 09:37.211
Next Christmas.

09:37.213 --> 09:39.080
It's a year and a half from now.

09:39.082 --> 09:41.833
We decided to wait, because
once I start art school, I...

09:41.835 --> 09:43.334
I won't have any time to plan.

09:43.336 --> 09:44.802
Art school.

09:44.804 --> 09:46.053
Parsons.

09:46.055 --> 09:49.540
I... I didn't know we had that in common.

09:51.927 --> 09:53.377
I assume that you don't sculpt.

09:54.380 --> 09:55.847
Mostly draw and paint.

09:55.849 --> 09:58.048
If I lived in the Hamptons,
that's what I'd do.

09:58.050 --> 09:59.383
The light here is beautiful.

09:59.385 --> 10:04.522
I spent the whole morning
painting on the beach.

10:04.524 --> 10:06.157
I'm gonna miss it in the city.

10:06.159 --> 10:09.577
It's a small price to pay
for an education at Parsons.

10:09.579 --> 10:11.612
Even if I will be the oldest student.

10:11.614 --> 10:14.949
Art has no age limit.

10:14.951 --> 10:18.002
And I've learned that life
can surprise you at any time.

10:20.907 --> 10:22.373
Paige...

10:22.375 --> 10:27.244
When I told you I went to rehab,
that was the truth.

10:27.246 --> 10:31.432
I was serious
about turning my life around.

10:31.434 --> 10:35.052
The only addiction
I have now is green tea.

10:37.523 --> 10:38.923
I'm sorry I doubted you.

10:38.925 --> 10:41.309
You want to...

10:41.311 --> 10:43.027
waddle around town together?

10:43.029 --> 10:46.814
All right.

10:46.816 --> 10:48.199
Well, that's quite a site.

10:48.201 --> 10:50.701
No, not her.

10:50.703 --> 10:51.736
Her.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.938
Georgette.

10:53.940 --> 10:55.039
Think she's pretty?

10:55.041 --> 10:57.158
No, I wouldn't say "pretty."

10:57.160 --> 11:02.129
I'd say "genetic perfection," actually.

11:02.131 --> 11:05.416
Jeremiah.

11:05.418 --> 11:06.500
What do you think?

11:06.502 --> 11:08.002
Think she's pretty?

11:08.004 --> 11:10.137
Forehead vertically aligned with the jaw,

11:10.139 --> 11:11.455
zero poikiloderma.

11:11.457 --> 11:13.457
Poikila... are you kidding me?
Is that even a word?

11:13.459 --> 11:15.292
It means her skin is flawless.

11:15.294 --> 11:17.428
Well, she has a severe
lack of poikiloderma, then.

11:17.430 --> 11:20.314
Her proportions are ideal, if improbable.

11:20.316 --> 11:23.467
I'd say maybe
one in every 3 million women.

11:23.469 --> 11:25.319
Though she may develop chronic back pain

11:25.321 --> 11:27.905
because of the size of her...

11:27.907 --> 11:30.491
Okay.

11:30.493 --> 11:31.609
Why are you asking about her?

11:31.611 --> 11:32.743
Is she a patient? Please say yes.

11:32.745 --> 11:33.744
No.

11:33.746 --> 11:37.815
I was just curious.

11:42.087 --> 11:43.421
Poikilo...

11:43.423 --> 11:46.841
What now...

11:54.333 --> 11:56.550
Another great dig by Krissy!

11:56.552 --> 11:58.636
Her game is really coming along.

11:58.638 --> 12:00.604
We're gonna take a quick break, folks...

12:00.606 --> 12:03.107
- Oh, hey, Hank.
- Hey!

12:03.109 --> 12:05.476
How's Aubrey? Heard she'll
be out for at least a month.

12:05.478 --> 12:07.812
Yeah, she'll be okay, but that's true.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.281
- Then it's real.
- What?

12:10.283 --> 12:12.566
I was invited to try out
to be Jessica's new partner.

12:12.568 --> 12:14.902
Whoa, Cameron, that's huge, isn't it?

12:14.904 --> 12:17.521
You don't seem too excited about it.

12:17.523 --> 12:20.491
Nausea came along
with the tryout invitation.

12:20.493 --> 12:22.076
It's probably just nerves.

12:22.078 --> 12:23.360
Well, it may be nerves,

12:23.362 --> 12:25.362
and I can give you some
anti-emetics for the nausea.

12:25.364 --> 12:26.831
Great.
Thanks.

12:26.833 --> 12:27.832
Yeah, sure.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.199
But given the cough,

12:29.201 --> 12:30.851
I'd like to take you
to the boathouse for a workup.

12:30.853 --> 12:31.869
Okay?

12:31.871 --> 12:35.423
Hank, this is the opportunity
of a lifetime for me.

12:35.425 --> 12:37.207
I can't blow it.

12:37.209 --> 12:38.926
I don't think not feeling well

12:38.928 --> 12:40.845
is considered "blowing it" in any sport.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.546
I don't care about not feeling well,

12:42.548 --> 12:44.181
I care about missing spikes and digs

12:44.183 --> 12:46.734
and kills because I'm not feeling well.

12:46.736 --> 12:49.720
Right now, I need to step up
and find my sand legs.

12:49.722 --> 12:51.355
Not in Dubai.

12:51.357 --> 12:53.190
Well, you definitely have
the determination of a champion.

12:53.192 --> 12:54.692
- Just do it. Get it done.
- I do now.

12:54.694 --> 12:55.993
Okay? All right. Get back to me.

12:55.995 --> 12:57.745
When my old partner
quit to start a family,

12:57.747 --> 12:59.563
I wondered if it was a sign.

12:59.565 --> 13:01.499
Then my yoga-head sister convinced me

13:01.501 --> 13:03.451
to visit a sweat lodge in Apache County.

13:03.453 --> 13:05.836
Isn't a sweat lodge in
the desert a little redundant?

13:05.838 --> 13:08.789
Well, I was looking for perspective.

13:08.791 --> 13:12.676
I mean, it took years
for my partner and me

13:12.678 --> 13:14.512
to develop trust
both on and off the court.

13:14.514 --> 13:17.048
I didn't know if I could
find that with someone else.

13:17.050 --> 13:19.183
Hmm. And what'd the sweat
lodge have to say about that?

13:20.386 --> 13:21.752
All that perspiring made me think

13:21.754 --> 13:23.938
about how much I've put into this dream.

13:23.940 --> 13:26.107
Volleyball may be a team sport,

13:26.109 --> 13:28.359
but I owe this opportunity to myself.

13:28.361 --> 13:30.528
Sounds like you found peace of mind.

13:30.530 --> 13:33.314
So, why won't my body observe the peace?

13:33.316 --> 13:35.483
Let's see if we can find out.

13:42.707 --> 13:45.442
Very nice.

13:45.444 --> 13:47.294
Great. That's it.

13:47.296 --> 13:48.746
That is so it.

13:48.748 --> 13:50.581
You love each other.

13:50.583 --> 13:53.584
- Yes!
- I'm... I'm sorry, Jill. I...

13:53.586 --> 13:56.220
I know that this is a very
long voicemail, but I just...

13:56.222 --> 13:59.056
I need a friend to tell me
that I am not crazy

13:59.058 --> 14:00.591
for being here.

14:00.593 --> 14:01.892
I'm not crazy, right?

14:01.894 --> 14:03.594
Oh, of course, you...

14:03.596 --> 14:04.728
you can't answer that.

14:04.730 --> 14:07.264
Okay, call me back. I miss you.

14:07.266 --> 14:08.265
Quiet on the set, please!

14:08.267 --> 14:10.234
The next person I hear talking

14:10.236 --> 14:11.936
is taking the shortcut
back down to the street.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.138
Thank you.

14:14.140 --> 14:16.306
Now, really lose your inhibitions.

14:16.308 --> 14:20.611
Be silly, be in love.
Okay? Enjoy each other.

14:30.255 --> 14:33.424
Stop.

14:33.426 --> 14:36.544
Ow. Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow. I hit my eye.

14:36.546 --> 14:39.880
Jesus Christ. Set medic, please.

14:39.882 --> 14:41.215
Set medic!

14:41.217 --> 14:43.500
- She's not on set right now.
- It really hurts.

14:43.502 --> 14:44.752
Well, of course she's not on set.

14:44.754 --> 14:46.103
Why would she be on set?
She's a set medic.

14:46.105 --> 14:46.904
We're looking for her.

14:46.906 --> 14:48.172
So, go look.

14:48.174 --> 14:50.141
It hurts, and I can't see.

14:50.143 --> 14:52.276
Can someone please help georgette?

14:52.278 --> 14:54.445
I'm sorry.

14:54.447 --> 14:57.648
I can.

14:57.650 --> 14:58.616
Who are you?

14:58.618 --> 15:00.017
Divya?

15:06.406 --> 15:09.291
The eye drops will treat
the corneal abrasion.

15:09.293 --> 15:12.043
I called in the prescription.
Should be waiting for you.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.246
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

15:21.504 --> 15:24.973
I... I have no idea what came over me.

15:24.975 --> 15:27.592
I am so sorry I came.
I'm sorry I snuck in.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.394
I'm very flattered.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.680
And seeing you do that with another man

15:31.682 --> 15:33.682
would have made me feel
the exact same way.

15:33.684 --> 15:35.850
It would?

15:35.852 --> 15:37.719
And I wouldn't have come to his aid.

15:37.721 --> 15:39.854
I would've let him go blind.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.691
They're ready for you, Rafa.

15:42.693 --> 15:45.193
Okay, thank you.

15:45.195 --> 15:48.496
Are you sure you're okay with this?

15:48.498 --> 15:49.864
Yes.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.951
I should be getting another break soon.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.002
Will you wait for me?

15:54.004 --> 15:55.420
Wait, yes.

15:55.422 --> 15:58.957
Uh, watch, not so much.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.913
Mm.

16:05.915 --> 16:07.849
He's even hotter in person.

16:07.851 --> 16:10.635
Right? Probably has
girlfriends in every city.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.854
Especially with
an exotic name like "Rafa."

16:12.856 --> 16:14.806
Actually, I hear he's very taken.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.358
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.476
Some gorgeous, dark-skinned goddess

16:18.478 --> 16:23.198
with an equally-exotic name that
I can't remember at the moment.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.283
I hear he's totally devoted
to her, and to their son.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.436
Every chance he gets,
flies home to see them.

16:28.438 --> 16:29.988
But he never talks about them

16:29.990 --> 16:32.490
so he can keep all of his female fans.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.658
Mm-hmm.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.467
Nice. Very nice.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.919
Come on, let's tickle!

16:44.921 --> 16:48.139
Oh, yes. Tickle her back. Oh, yeah.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.342
Well, good news, Howard.

16:50.344 --> 16:53.094
Looks like that stray volleyball
didn't fracture your nose.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.263
But it's not labor day weekend
in Dubai, is it?

16:55.265 --> 16:56.731
- Let me get that for you.
- Good guess.

16:56.733 --> 17:00.018
Execute the transfer, email
the group, and call me back.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.519
Sorry, doc. What were you saying?

17:01.521 --> 17:02.570
Just that you're all set.

17:02.572 --> 17:03.805
Ah. What do I owe you?

17:03.807 --> 17:05.306
Oh, no, I'm working for the tournament.

17:05.308 --> 17:06.808
You can tell your boss the courtside seats

17:06.810 --> 17:07.909
should come with a healthcare plan.

17:07.911 --> 17:08.993
They do. Me.

17:08.996 --> 17:11.613
For your trouble.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.080
Oh, no... I...

17:13.083 --> 17:16.284
Call me. I'll help you invest that.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.286
Listen, I'm good.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.154
But Evan...

17:20.156 --> 17:24.092
Howard, this is Evan R. Lawson,
CFO of Hankmed.

17:24.094 --> 17:26.094
Evan, this is Howard Katz
of Open Door Capital.

17:26.096 --> 17:27.679
Evan Lawson?

17:27.681 --> 17:29.714
I feel like we met.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.182
Vip room at South Pointe?

17:31.184 --> 17:33.101
No, I've never been there.

17:33.103 --> 17:35.637
But, uh, I'll be following up with you

17:35.639 --> 17:37.055
just to make sure you're pleased

17:37.057 --> 17:38.673
with our level of care
and everything, okay?

17:38.675 --> 17:40.809
Nice to meet you.

17:40.811 --> 17:42.560
Hey, I told you, we can't
lose on this deal.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.946
Just follow my orders.

17:44.948 --> 17:48.066
Uh, just one second.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.284
Nope. Normal.

17:49.286 --> 17:50.568
What are you doing?

17:50.570 --> 17:51.736
Worrying. Are you okay?

17:51.738 --> 17:53.154
That guy had "whale" written all over him.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.523
What that guy has written all over him,

17:55.525 --> 17:56.858
you don't want to be reading.

17:56.860 --> 17:58.393
Well, yeah, he's
a little cliche, but I mean...

17:58.395 --> 17:59.327
No, look, Henry, I...

17:59.329 --> 18:02.997
I do know him, okay? From the city.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.633
That guy lost a lot of people
a lot of money.

18:05.635 --> 18:07.802
We do not want him as a client.

18:07.804 --> 18:09.971
We don't even want him
as a patient. Trust me.

18:09.973 --> 18:11.005
Okay.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.425
Hank, thank you so much.

18:13.427 --> 18:15.310
Those anti-nausea meds did the trick.

18:15.312 --> 18:16.878
That is great news, Cameron.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.513
Yeah. I'm going for a run on the beach.

18:18.515 --> 18:19.814
Try and channel my nerves

18:19.816 --> 18:21.933
- before the big tryout with Jess.
- Good idea.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.069
Head east, take a left
at the lifeguard station.

18:24.071 --> 18:26.354
There's a great jogging path
there, totally quiet.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.890
Wow, you are really full-service.

18:28.892 --> 18:31.159
Well, you know.

18:31.161 --> 18:32.827
Ooh, Ev, I got to get to Shadow Pond.

18:32.829 --> 18:33.778
I will catch you later.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.029
Sayonara.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.030
- Hi, Paige.
- Hi.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.615
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.401
Guess what just happened.

18:40.403 --> 18:42.236
Mani-pedi nirvana?

18:42.238 --> 18:46.040
I just had a great conversation with Lou.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.542
Lou called you?

18:47.544 --> 18:49.243
No, I bumped into her in town.

18:49.245 --> 18:51.412
Just coincidentally, you bumped into her?

18:51.414 --> 18:54.516
- Totally.
- Hmm.

18:54.518 --> 18:58.103
Maybe I've been
holding her past against her.

18:58.105 --> 19:01.139
I mean, it's possible she
completely changed, isn't it?

19:01.141 --> 19:03.391
Yeah.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.610
Of course, yeah, it's...

19:05.612 --> 19:08.313
People leave their past behind
all the time.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.866
- It's Lou.
- Oh.

19:11.868 --> 19:12.817
Hello?

19:12.819 --> 19:14.769
Hi.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.762
You're sure you're getting
my results, not tweeting them?

19:40.764 --> 19:43.314
Thanks for your patience, Dmitry.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.766
Here they are now.

19:44.768 --> 19:48.269
Okay.

19:48.271 --> 19:49.354
Everything looks normal.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.105
Yeah, we may even be able

19:51.107 --> 19:53.107
to release you from glycemic prison,

19:53.109 --> 19:55.243
and let you rely just on Stanley.

19:55.245 --> 19:59.247
Stanley, you may be back to work soon.

19:59.249 --> 20:02.450
Your white count is good.
Your rash is resolving.

20:02.452 --> 20:05.587
You may be back
to political intrigue soon.

20:05.589 --> 20:07.321
You're still mad at me, eh?

20:07.323 --> 20:10.124
Not everyone is used to you
pulling a gun on them, Dima.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.593
Oh, so he does that a lot.

20:11.595 --> 20:14.295
Only when he wants to make a point.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.881
And the point we made, didn't we, Boris?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.850
It appears we may have.

20:18.852 --> 20:22.003
Ah, so your venture was successful.

20:22.005 --> 20:25.190
Not yet, but...

20:25.192 --> 20:27.442
Seems to be moving in the right direction,

20:27.444 --> 20:29.677
thanks to our little field trip.

20:29.679 --> 20:31.646
Shall we make it official, Dima?

20:31.648 --> 20:33.347
Yeah, why not?

20:33.349 --> 20:35.450
Why are you looking at me?

20:35.452 --> 20:38.286
Well, in keeping
with Russian tradition, Hank,

20:38.288 --> 20:41.573
Dmitry would like to celebrate
his success in the vodka room

20:41.575 --> 20:44.826
by sharing a toast.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.193
If you don't mind.

20:46.195 --> 20:48.546
Give your body
till Saturday night to recover,

20:48.548 --> 20:50.164
and if you're still doing fine,

20:50.166 --> 20:52.967
then I'm sure a sip of some very
premium vodka won't kill you.

20:52.969 --> 20:54.502
Thank you so much.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.421
Would you care to join us for a drink?

20:56.423 --> 20:58.089
Uh, no, thank you. I'll be out of town.

20:58.091 --> 21:02.376
Plus I've already had my toast
in the vodka room.

21:03.929 --> 21:07.682
Gentlemen.

21:18.827 --> 21:20.194
Hey.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.613
You sure you and Jeremiah are okay

21:21.615 --> 21:23.164
managing the Hankmed tent alone?

21:23.166 --> 21:25.450
We're not gonna be alone.
We'll have each other.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.834
Oh, how sweet.

21:26.836 --> 21:28.469
Yeah, go ahead. Do your thing.
We've got it covered.

21:28.471 --> 21:30.838
Thanks. I appreciate it.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.040
- Ooh.
- Nice.

21:37.079 --> 21:38.880
What's wrong?

21:38.882 --> 21:40.548
What?

21:40.550 --> 21:42.400
Are you feeling guilty about
leaving the tournament early,

21:42.402 --> 21:44.251
or are you just getting
cold feet about the big trip?

21:44.253 --> 21:45.753
No, I told you, I'm looking forward

21:45.755 --> 21:47.188
to getting some away time with Harper.

21:47.190 --> 21:48.222
And meeting her family.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.391
- It's gonna be awesome.
- Okay.

21:50.393 --> 21:53.895
I can't really blame you for
moving forward so fast with her,

21:53.897 --> 21:57.482
'cause Harper's... you know, she rocks.

21:57.484 --> 22:00.151
Yeah. Yeah, she kinda does.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.403
She really does, but I... I also
don't want to underplay

22:02.405 --> 22:04.438
the fact that this is
like a big step for you.

22:04.440 --> 22:08.910
In the past,
you've struggled with big steps.

22:08.912 --> 22:10.328
Nice!

22:10.330 --> 22:11.329
Oh, nice play!

22:15.552 --> 22:17.635
Uh, I'll... I'll be right back.

22:17.637 --> 22:21.339
Cameron?

22:21.341 --> 22:23.508
Cameron.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.093
Hank, what's happening to me?

22:30.629 --> 22:31.879
Okay, easy.

22:31.881 --> 22:35.183
Let's get you right up here on this table.

22:35.185 --> 22:39.520
Okay.

22:39.522 --> 22:42.256
Okay, deep breath in and out.

22:42.258 --> 22:45.426
Again.

22:45.428 --> 22:47.728
I hear crackling.

22:47.730 --> 22:49.063
Cameron, I need you to say "99."

22:49.065 --> 22:50.064
99.

22:50.066 --> 22:52.149
- Again.
- 99.

22:52.151 --> 22:54.735
- One more time.
- 99.

22:54.737 --> 22:56.437
- Okay.
- Couldn't I just say 297?

22:57.624 --> 22:59.207
Hank is checking for fremitus.

22:59.209 --> 23:01.075
Oh, fremitus. What's that?

23:01.077 --> 23:03.944
Palpable vibration
over areas containing fluid.

23:03.946 --> 23:04.996
Yours is abnormal.

23:04.998 --> 23:06.947
Wh... why can't I vibrate normally?

23:06.949 --> 23:08.716
Because of a pleural effusion.

23:08.718 --> 23:10.001
A pleural what?

23:10.003 --> 23:11.485
Fluid within the membrane
surrounding your lung,

23:11.487 --> 23:13.087
- restricting its movement.
- Sorry.

23:13.089 --> 23:14.555
- Can we do anything about that?
- Yes.

23:14.557 --> 23:15.873
A thoracentesis.

23:15.875 --> 23:17.174
Okay, it really hurts. I can't breathe.

23:17.176 --> 23:18.392
Okay, we've got to do this now.

23:22.180 --> 23:23.598
Okay, Cameron, you'll feel

23:23.600 --> 23:25.099
a little pressure now on your right side.

23:25.101 --> 23:26.100
Okay.

23:36.194 --> 23:40.481
Okay, once the fluid is all
gone, you'll feel much better.

23:40.483 --> 23:44.452
Okay, and now you'll feel
a lot more pressure.

23:53.545 --> 23:56.764
Good.

24:00.719 --> 24:02.720
Jeremiah, would you hold that for me?

24:02.722 --> 24:05.773
Thank you.

24:05.775 --> 24:09.677
Okay.

24:19.905 --> 24:21.355
Can I have the needle?

24:21.357 --> 24:23.207
When I give you the go-ahead,
open the line, okay?

24:23.209 --> 24:25.042
And...

24:25.044 --> 24:29.830
open the line.

24:29.832 --> 24:31.048
Good.

24:31.050 --> 24:35.419
Good suction.

24:35.421 --> 24:37.805
Oh, my God. That's much better.

24:37.807 --> 24:40.040
Would you hold that for me? Thank you.

24:40.042 --> 24:42.760
Cameron, this won't solve
the underlying problem.

24:42.762 --> 24:44.545
Which is what?

24:44.547 --> 24:46.147
I'll send the fluid for analysis,

24:46.149 --> 24:48.516
but based on your symptoms,
I think you have pneumonia.

24:48.518 --> 24:51.986
- How long till it clears up?
- It's hard to predict.

24:51.988 --> 24:53.688
I'll give you a shot of antibiotics now,

24:53.690 --> 24:54.905
and more to take tonight.

24:54.907 --> 24:56.524
I'm confident that'll do the trick,

24:56.526 --> 24:57.891
and we'll check in again in the morning.

24:57.893 --> 25:00.995
Okay.

25:08.704 --> 25:12.540
- I'm glad you called.
- Me too.

25:12.542 --> 25:14.508
You have a nice handle on pink.

25:14.510 --> 25:16.877
Thank you.

25:16.879 --> 25:19.347
It used to be more bubble-gummy,

25:19.349 --> 25:23.100
but I've been working on adding some gray.

25:23.102 --> 25:25.469
I'm more of a sculptor and a welder.

25:25.471 --> 25:27.588
Maybe that's why my sun is looking

25:27.590 --> 25:29.473
like it's made out of cast iron.

25:33.095 --> 25:34.528
Can I see more of your work?

25:34.530 --> 25:36.930
Uh...

25:36.932 --> 25:38.866
Okay.

25:38.868 --> 25:43.320
But go easy on me.

25:43.322 --> 25:46.607
Wow.

25:46.609 --> 25:51.212
You are one tough young woman.

25:51.214 --> 25:52.463
What makes you say that?

25:52.465 --> 25:55.332
Your work is strong and edgy.

25:55.334 --> 25:56.751
It's not at all bubble-gummy,

25:56.753 --> 25:58.919
if you don't mind my saying.

25:58.921 --> 26:00.171
No, I...

26:00.173 --> 26:04.058
I actually appreciate the feedback.

26:04.060 --> 26:05.676
My parents, um...

26:05.678 --> 26:07.428
They've always supported my art,

26:07.430 --> 26:10.964
but as a hobby, not as a career.

26:10.966 --> 26:13.100
I... I'm... I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean to...

26:13.102 --> 26:16.187
Paige, I am grateful to the Collins.

26:16.189 --> 26:19.273
They loved you, they took care of you,

26:19.275 --> 26:21.075
they raised you incredibly well.

26:21.077 --> 26:25.362
That's everything I ever
dreamed of for my daughter.

26:25.364 --> 26:28.148
Thank you.

26:30.836 --> 26:33.871
By the way, where are you
staying while you're here?

26:33.873 --> 26:35.956
Oh, well...

26:35.958 --> 26:38.092
- I'm camping.
- What?

26:38.094 --> 26:41.429
Well, the hotels in the
Hamptons are way too expensive.

26:41.431 --> 26:44.548
But I... I love sleeping
underneath the stars.

26:44.550 --> 26:46.434
No, I'm calling The Blackstone.

26:46.436 --> 26:47.601
What's that?

26:47.603 --> 26:48.686
It's a club my family belongs to.

26:48.688 --> 26:50.638
They make rooms available to members.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.940
Oh, well, that's not necessary.

26:52.942 --> 26:55.476
No, I'm gonna meet you there,
help get you checked in,

26:55.478 --> 26:56.894
and then we'll have lunch.

26:56.896 --> 27:01.065
It'll be perfect.

27:01.067 --> 27:03.067
Okay.

27:06.955 --> 27:08.405
Hey.

27:08.407 --> 27:10.825
Thanks for covering me tomorrow.
Really appreciate it.

27:10.827 --> 27:13.327
Oh, I... I hope you enjoy
Dr. Kubelick's family gathering.

27:13.329 --> 27:16.130
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I hope so too.

27:17.999 --> 27:20.334
Will Divya be coming in today?

27:20.336 --> 27:22.136
Uh, no. She's off today.

27:22.138 --> 27:23.971
Oh, like she was yesterday.

27:23.973 --> 27:26.507
Yeah, it's good that she's
spending some time on herself.

27:26.509 --> 27:29.810
I'm glad to see her so happy.

27:29.812 --> 27:32.980
I am too.

27:32.982 --> 27:35.850
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

27:35.852 --> 27:37.101
Jessica chose me.

27:37.103 --> 27:41.221
What? Cameron, that's awesome!

27:41.223 --> 27:43.524
Why am I always more excited
about these things than you are?

27:43.526 --> 27:45.893
Emotionally, I'm excited, but...

27:45.895 --> 27:49.280
Physically, I feel like my
head's still buried in the sand.

27:49.282 --> 27:52.616
Okay, well, let's take a look.

27:52.618 --> 27:55.786
Have a seat.

27:59.958 --> 28:02.376
Deep breath in and out.

28:02.378 --> 28:04.512
And again.

28:07.216 --> 28:09.967
Sounds better.

28:09.969 --> 28:12.386
So, how'd the replacement take it?

28:12.388 --> 28:15.105
She seemed as relieved as I was.

28:15.107 --> 28:16.640
We just weren't clicking.

28:16.642 --> 28:18.776
Fever's down to 100 degrees.

28:18.778 --> 28:20.477
But that's still a fever, though.

28:20.479 --> 28:22.146
Yeah, but the antibiotics are working.

28:22.148 --> 28:23.480
Not as fast as I'd like.

28:23.482 --> 28:24.932
Not as fast as I'd like either, but...

28:24.934 --> 28:26.784
what if I've already
given Jessica my best?

28:26.786 --> 28:28.569
What if I've got nothing left in my tank?

28:28.571 --> 28:30.454
I mean, do you think I need to back out?

28:30.456 --> 28:33.908
If you're really not feeling
up to it, then yes, you should.

28:33.910 --> 28:36.493
But I suspect the pneumonia's

28:36.495 --> 28:38.078
not your biggest problem right now.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.664
Uh... wh... what is?

28:40.666 --> 28:42.917
You finally got what you wanted.

28:42.919 --> 28:44.218
Now you have to deliver.

28:44.220 --> 28:46.136
I mean, that can overwhelm
anyone with anxiety.

28:46.138 --> 28:48.639
Do I need a prescription for that?

28:48.641 --> 28:51.809
Yes, you do. And here it is.

28:51.811 --> 28:53.260
You don't have to play
until tomorrow, right?

28:53.262 --> 28:55.429
Get some rest.

28:55.431 --> 28:57.097
Give your body a chance to recover,

28:57.099 --> 28:58.599
and don't worry about anything else.

28:58.601 --> 29:00.684
- Okay.
- Okay?

29:00.686 --> 29:02.770
Maybe you'll find your sand legs

29:02.772 --> 29:06.807
by believing they're already there.

29:11.780 --> 29:14.164
She's such an exciting artist,

29:14.166 --> 29:17.451
and she said that I inspired her
to do more painting.

29:17.453 --> 29:19.152
Which is why you bought her these brushes.

29:19.154 --> 29:20.871
I can't wait to see
what she does with them.

29:20.873 --> 29:22.139
Did I tell you she likes my edgy stuff?

29:22.141 --> 29:23.156
You did.

29:23.158 --> 29:24.592
Did you even know I had edgy stuff?

29:24.594 --> 29:25.876
I did not.

29:25.878 --> 29:28.045
- Ah, there she is.
- Okay.

29:31.833 --> 29:33.601
Hi.

29:33.603 --> 29:35.302
Is everything okay?

29:35.304 --> 29:39.640
I am so sorry, Paige.
I... I... I shouldn't have come here.

29:39.642 --> 29:42.359
To The Blackstone?
Why? Did something happen?

29:42.361 --> 29:44.528
No, not to The Blackstone,
to the Hamptons.

29:44.530 --> 29:46.563
To your home.

29:46.565 --> 29:48.015
What are you talking about?

29:48.017 --> 29:50.851
Last summer,

29:50.853 --> 29:53.370
I hired a private investigator.

29:53.372 --> 29:56.023
I gave him about half of my money,

29:56.025 --> 29:58.242
and a DNA sample.

29:58.244 --> 30:01.161
And then I never heard from him again.

30:01.163 --> 30:03.964
I took him for some huckster.

30:03.966 --> 30:06.667
He... he...

30:06.669 --> 30:11.005
he called me about an hour ago.

30:11.007 --> 30:14.508
There's a woman in Michigan that he found.

30:14.510 --> 30:18.012
Her DNA matches mine.

30:18.014 --> 30:20.481
I am so sorry, Paige.

30:20.483 --> 30:23.150
I'm not your mother.

30:34.367 --> 30:35.734
Yeah, me too.

30:35.736 --> 30:37.085
All right, look, the second you get this,

30:37.087 --> 30:41.040
please, just call me. Thank you.

30:41.042 --> 30:44.710
My family eagerly awaits us.

30:44.712 --> 30:46.128
Is everything okay?

30:46.130 --> 30:47.546
Yeah, I'd just like a status update

30:47.548 --> 30:48.714
on this player I was treating,

30:48.716 --> 30:50.215
but I can't reach Jeremiah.

30:50.217 --> 30:52.217
Must've gotten busy in the tent.

30:52.219 --> 30:53.802
How 'bout calling her directly?

30:53.804 --> 30:56.772
I tried. Straight to voicemail.

30:56.774 --> 30:58.423
How could someone so young and healthy

30:58.425 --> 31:01.226
get pneumonia and not be
more responsive to antibiotics?

31:01.228 --> 31:02.695
How long has she been symptomatic?

31:02.697 --> 31:04.530
She's had the cough for a week,

31:04.532 --> 31:05.731
prior to that, no illness.

31:05.733 --> 31:07.432
Volleyball players travel a lot.

31:07.434 --> 31:09.401
Maybe her immune system
was weakened by fatigue.

31:09.403 --> 31:13.572
She was in a sweat lodge
in Arizona two weeks ago.

31:13.574 --> 31:15.440
Okay.

31:15.442 --> 31:16.709
There was that hantavirus outbreak

31:16.711 --> 31:18.276
in Apache County a couple years back.

31:18.278 --> 31:20.278
Hantavirus?

31:20.280 --> 31:21.914
Look, I know it's not
an everyday diagnosis,

31:21.916 --> 31:23.499
but the incubation period lines up,

31:23.501 --> 31:25.283
along with her cough, nausea, and fever.

31:25.285 --> 31:26.301
Yeah, but...

31:26.303 --> 31:27.953
I should get another lactate level.

31:27.955 --> 31:29.054
I mean, if it's still below four,

31:29.056 --> 31:30.222
I can get her to the hospital

31:30.224 --> 31:31.757
before she goes into
massive respiratory failure.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.425
So, it was below four yesterday.

31:33.427 --> 31:34.810
Metabolic acidosis

31:34.812 --> 31:36.095
can spiral things out of control quickly.

31:36.097 --> 31:38.230
She's not in metabolic acidosis.

31:38.232 --> 31:40.298
I don't know that for sure.

31:46.022 --> 31:47.856
I guess you should go check on her.

31:47.858 --> 31:50.442
I think I should.

31:51.696 --> 31:54.196
I'm sorry, Harper.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.400
Hey!

32:20.974 --> 32:24.309
You left the photo shoot
without saying good-bye.

32:24.311 --> 32:26.862
And you didn't call me back yesterday.

32:26.864 --> 32:28.947
Were you busy rescuing more supermodels?

32:28.949 --> 32:32.451
Do you have a wife and child in Argentina?

32:45.298 --> 32:48.333
Who told you that?

32:48.335 --> 32:49.635
Is it true?

32:49.637 --> 32:52.604
I do have a child.

32:52.606 --> 32:55.307
With an ex-girlfriend, not a wife.

32:55.309 --> 32:58.093
But I suppose that's not the point.

32:58.095 --> 32:59.711
You lied to me.

32:59.713 --> 33:00.679
No.

33:00.681 --> 33:02.214
No, I never lied.

33:02.216 --> 33:05.651
Every time you looked at me

33:05.653 --> 33:10.155
and said those suave
little things you said,

33:10.157 --> 33:11.273
you lied to me.

33:11.275 --> 33:13.075
We only met recently,

33:13.077 --> 33:14.559
and I didn't know where this was going.

33:14.561 --> 33:16.945
So, I didn't want to mention it yet.

33:16.947 --> 33:18.947
It felt like too much too soon.

33:18.949 --> 33:22.334
Do you know what this feels like?

33:22.336 --> 33:23.786
If I were to mention my son immediately

33:23.788 --> 33:27.405
to every woman I slept with, I...

33:28.742 --> 33:32.261
So, that's what I am. Just...

33:32.263 --> 33:33.295
One of those.

33:33.297 --> 33:34.513
No.

33:34.515 --> 33:36.348
Or should I say...

33:36.350 --> 33:39.351
That's what I <i>was.</i>

33:39.353 --> 33:40.469
Divya.

33:40.471 --> 33:45.557
Divya...

33:45.559 --> 33:46.758
Divya.

33:52.816 --> 33:55.234
I have to say, Hank,
that epidemiologically,

33:55.236 --> 33:57.202
the odds of a hantavirus case
are very slim.

33:57.204 --> 33:58.737
We need to find her now, Jeremiah,

33:58.739 --> 33:59.822
she could be in serious...

34:02.710 --> 34:04.326
trouble.

34:08.665 --> 34:11.583
Krissy! For another point.

34:13.002 --> 34:14.636
Well, she doesn't seem to have contracted

34:14.638 --> 34:16.755
- a negative sense RNA virus.
- Hank!

34:16.757 --> 34:19.623
I'm feeling so much better.

34:19.626 --> 34:21.793
Yeah, I could see that.

34:21.795 --> 34:22.895
And I'm so glad.

34:22.897 --> 34:25.230
The antibiotics must have kicked in.

34:25.232 --> 34:28.433
Here.

34:28.435 --> 34:29.935
Normal temperature.

34:29.937 --> 34:30.902
Well, thanks to you.

34:30.905 --> 34:32.237
I mean, I took your advice

34:32.239 --> 34:33.688
about resting and not sweating anything.

34:33.690 --> 34:35.824
Other than that pneumonia
out of my system.

34:35.826 --> 34:37.192
Well, I guess that did the trick.

34:37.194 --> 34:38.694
And you didn't even need a lodge.

34:38.696 --> 34:41.196
Wait, aren't you supposed to be away?

34:41.197 --> 34:43.581
Change of plans.

34:43.583 --> 34:45.617
Well, I hope you can
stick around for the match.

34:47.288 --> 34:48.652
Oh, wish me luck.

34:48.655 --> 34:49.755
I think you're past needing it.

34:49.757 --> 34:52.991
11-10, folks.
We've got a tight one brewing.

34:52.993 --> 34:55.010
I'll head back to the tent.

34:55.012 --> 34:59.097
Sorry you came back for nothing.

35:04.855 --> 35:07.055
Krissy! With a spectacular diving save

35:07.057 --> 35:08.440
to earn the point.

35:11.945 --> 35:13.445
Hey, babe.

35:13.447 --> 35:14.679
Hey.

35:14.681 --> 35:15.847
And don't call me that.

35:15.849 --> 35:17.366
What are you doing here?

35:17.368 --> 35:20.619
Aren't you supposed to be losing
a geriatric parcheesi showdown

35:20.621 --> 35:21.904
in Rhode Island right now?

35:21.906 --> 35:26.825
Change of plans.

35:30.247 --> 35:35.167
Uh, sorry, guys, I'll see you inside.

35:35.169 --> 35:36.168
Hey.

35:36.170 --> 35:38.670
Hey. How's your family?

35:38.672 --> 35:41.039
Good. How's your patient?

35:41.041 --> 35:44.509
She's doing better.

35:44.511 --> 35:47.396
- So, you made it back in time.
- I did.

35:47.398 --> 35:51.650
Um, turns out it was just pneumonia.

35:51.652 --> 35:55.854
In fact, Cameron and her partner
won the whole tournament.

35:55.856 --> 35:57.990
Wow, that's great.

35:57.992 --> 36:00.359
She must've been happy
you were there for her.

36:00.361 --> 36:04.613
Yeah.

36:04.615 --> 36:06.748
So...

36:06.750 --> 36:08.450
are we on for a jog Monday morning?

36:08.452 --> 36:12.287
'Cause I gotta say, I miss
my workout partner already.

36:12.289 --> 36:14.957
Actually, Hank, I think
I'm gonna have my associate

36:14.959 --> 36:19.962
cover for me next week too,
and not rush back so fast.

36:19.964 --> 36:22.914
Yeah, um...

36:22.916 --> 36:26.918
Well, have fun up there. And...

36:26.920 --> 36:30.939
and tell your family...

36:30.941 --> 36:33.025
I'm really sorry I missed out.

36:33.027 --> 36:37.529
I will. Bye, Hank.

36:54.547 --> 36:57.615
So...

36:57.617 --> 36:59.951
you came back because of a patient?

36:59.953 --> 37:04.956
I thought I did.

37:04.958 --> 37:10.345
But now I think I used a patient
to hold myself back.

37:10.347 --> 37:13.965
Well...

37:13.967 --> 37:16.735
Yeah, I mean, it... it was a big step.

37:16.737 --> 37:19.688
I thought I blew a major call today.

37:22.526 --> 37:27.446
Turns out I blew two.

37:43.855 --> 37:46.272
No, Jill, I said...

37:46.274 --> 37:48.691
I said, "how could I think
that this would become"

37:48.693 --> 37:50.609
"more than just a fling?"

37:50.611 --> 37:53.446
I know, I know, you're right.

37:53.448 --> 37:56.298
Anyway.

37:56.300 --> 37:57.950
Oh!

37:59.737 --> 38:00.836
It's over now.

38:00.838 --> 38:04.406
Which is good, I think.

38:04.408 --> 38:07.760
I wish that you were here, Jill.

38:07.762 --> 38:12.798
I could use a drink.

38:12.800 --> 38:13.799
Jill?

38:13.801 --> 38:16.802
Hello?

38:16.804 --> 38:18.053
Jill, can you hear me?

38:18.055 --> 38:19.522
Jill?

38:32.652 --> 38:35.654
I wasn't sure what kind
of drink you wanted, so...

38:35.656 --> 38:39.441
Covered my bases.

39:07.187 --> 39:10.155
Oh...

39:27.708 --> 39:30.543
What?

39:30.545 --> 39:33.462
The DNA results.

39:33.464 --> 39:37.466
Lou is officially not my mother.

39:42.472 --> 39:44.273
I'm worried about you.

39:44.275 --> 39:46.392
Why? I'm fine.

39:46.394 --> 39:49.478
Oh, yeah?

39:49.480 --> 39:50.512
You're kinda fine.

39:50.514 --> 39:51.981
For now.

39:51.983 --> 39:54.516
But this has been
a huge life ordeal for you.

39:54.518 --> 39:56.819
And you're gonna be alone.

39:56.821 --> 39:59.705
Evan...

39:59.707 --> 40:01.373
If there's one thing I know for sure,

40:01.375 --> 40:03.292
it's that I am not alone.

40:03.294 --> 40:06.462
You've been my constant through all this.

40:06.464 --> 40:10.699
You've been my rock.

40:10.701 --> 40:11.834
In fact...

40:11.836 --> 40:14.202
More than anyone else,

40:14.204 --> 40:18.173
you have been my family.

40:19.476 --> 40:22.544
You've been my family too.

40:25.549 --> 40:29.768
So, what are we waiting for?

40:29.770 --> 40:31.820
Are... are you saying
what I think you're saying?

40:31.822 --> 40:33.155
I think I am, yeah.

40:33.157 --> 40:34.239
Let's remove all doubt.

40:34.241 --> 40:36.025
Paige Collins, I want to marry you.

40:36.027 --> 40:40.228
And I want to do it
as soon as humanly possible.

40:40.230 --> 40:43.499
Okay, but what about school,
and what about...

40:43.501 --> 40:44.867
I agree, we can come up with

40:44.869 --> 40:46.835
50 reasons why it's a crazy idea.

40:46.837 --> 40:48.954
We only need one reason
to just do it anyway.

40:51.375 --> 40:54.793
Well, I've always wanted
a December wedding, but...

40:54.795 --> 40:56.128
So, why wait till next December?

40:56.130 --> 40:57.513
There's one coming up in a few months.

40:57.515 --> 41:00.599
I mean it.

41:02.053 --> 41:04.353
Does that mean yes?

41:04.355 --> 41:05.387
- Yes!
- Okay.

41:43.309 --> 41:44.476
Dr. Lawson.

41:44.478 --> 41:46.428
Aren't you scheduled to be out of town?

41:46.430 --> 41:48.564
Yeah, change of plans.
Udo, what happened here?

41:48.566 --> 41:50.399
Yeah, we don't know.

41:50.401 --> 41:51.650
Perhaps an electrical fire.

41:51.652 --> 41:53.068
We think it started
in the old meat locker.

41:53.070 --> 41:54.520
The vodka room.

41:54.522 --> 41:55.821
- Yes.
- Where's Boris?

41:55.823 --> 41:57.139
We tried to get in.

41:57.141 --> 41:59.541
The door appears to have been
locked from the inside!
