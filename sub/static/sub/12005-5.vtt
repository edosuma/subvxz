00:04.823 --> 00:06.523
I'm sober, Kathryn.

00:06.558 --> 00:08.626
I've been sober for 11 and a half years.

00:08.660 --> 00:12.296
- What are you doing?
- Trying to figure out what to do with myself

00:12.330 --> 00:14.398
now that I'm no longer a hairdresser.

00:14.432 --> 00:17.401
- Reggie?
- Hi! What's it been, 15 years?

00:17.435 --> 00:20.137
- Yeah.
- Kathryn, this is Zane.

00:20.171 --> 00:21.238
Zane, Kathryn.

01:16.261 --> 01:17.961
My last class was study hall.

01:17.996 --> 01:21.098
Hey, do you have any of those
sea-salt pita chip thingies?

01:21.132 --> 01:22.966
Yeah. Wait wait wait!

01:23.001 --> 01:25.102
- Wash your hands.
- Oh, sorry.

01:25.136 --> 01:27.805
I'm doing pottery with
Regina... throwing clay.

01:27.839 --> 01:29.973
It's super wet and shapey.

<i>- She can do that with her hands?
- That's the cool part.</i>

01:32.844 --> 01:35.946
She just tells me what to do and I do it.

01:35.980 --> 01:38.649
It's like I'm her hands.
Total vulcan mind meld.

01:38.683 --> 01:40.784
Well, I'm gonna be making
Turkey meatballs later.

01:40.819 --> 01:42.619
Maybe you can come and be my hands.

01:42.654 --> 01:44.488
That's hilarious. You know what...

01:44.522 --> 01:45.656
I think I'm just gonna
have dinner over there

01:45.690 --> 01:48.392

03:27.225 --> 03:28.559
Hey, can I interrupt for a second?

03:28.593 --> 03:31.295
- Absolutely you may.
- So I'm thinking about applying

03:31.329 --> 03:33.297
- to Washington University.
- Oh!

03:33.331 --> 03:35.499
- Wash U.
- But it's competitive,

03:35.533 --> 03:38.402
so a family connection

03:38.436 --> 03:41.271
- would really help out.
- Okay.

03:41.306 --> 03:44.208
Grandpa Bill went to Wash U, didn't he?

03:44.242 --> 03:46.443
Toby, you get good grades,

03:46.478 --> 03:49.179
you're going to a good
school. You're gonna be fine.

03:49.214 --> 03:52.616
Honey, he's not wrong. These days
you have to press every advantage.

03:52.650 --> 03:55.519
A recommendation from someone
who hasn't been there in 40 years?

03:55.553 --> 03:58.288
- What good is that gonna do?
- Can I at least ask, though?

03:58.323 --> 04:02.292
- I mean, what's the harm?
- Well, it's your application.

04:02.327 --> 04:04.561
Do what you want.

04:04.596 --> 04:06.597
I need a bathroom break. Be right back.

04:09.334 --> 04:12.402
Well, I know Grandpa Bill isn't coming over

04:12.437 --> 04:15.339
for Sunday dinners, but I
can't even ask for a favor?

04:15.373 --> 04:19.176
He said yes. I'd just run with that.

04:19.209 --> 04:22.312
Two vodka rocks, one with a twist. Hang on.

04:32.557 --> 04:35.158
Excuse me. You're with Zane, right?

04:35.193 --> 04:36.627
- Um...
- Oh, sorry.

04:36.661 --> 04:38.562
Not asking for a status update.

04:38.596 --> 04:40.597
It's just could you take
this tray up to the guys?

04:40.632 --> 04:42.533
I'm a little slammed here.

04:42.567 --> 04:45.168
- Sure.
- You are over 21, right?

04:45.203 --> 04:46.570
(Chuckles) Nice try.

04:46.604 --> 04:50.407
A little flattery to grease
the wheels. You know what? Here.

04:50.441 --> 04:52.175
For you.

04:52.210 --> 04:54.278
I call it a "headless horseman."

04:54.312 --> 04:56.346

I at least want to ride in a limo.

05:04.556 --> 05:07.224
Who is selling their soul?

05:07.258 --> 05:09.593
Zane's trying to book us into
some corporate death march.

05:09.627 --> 05:12.362
It's event, Stan. It's an event.

05:12.397 --> 05:15.198
You call it what you want,
I don't do background music.

05:15.233 --> 05:18.101
Try being unemployed. That'll
get you over your integrity.

05:18.136 --> 05:20.571
Please. He's a drummer.
They're never unemployed.

05:20.605 --> 05:24.241
Here is to working for an honest living.

05:24.275 --> 05:25.542

- Salut.</i>

05:27.145 --> 05:29.279
- Is that yours?
- Oh, um...

05:30.315 --> 05:31.582
I'm on a cleanse.

05:31.616 --> 05:34.117
I gotta hit the little drummer's room.

05:36.454 --> 05:39.289
- I liked your set.
- I liked having you here.

05:39.324 --> 05:43.293
You are not gonna call me a
"muse" at any point, are you?

05:43.328 --> 05:46.196
- Not out loud, no.
- (Laughs)

05:47.532 --> 05:49.499
I'm gonna have to go pretty soon.

05:49.534 --> 05:52.603
No no... you gotta stay for my next set.

05:52.637 --> 05:55.439
Zane, I have to make breakfast at 7:00 A.M.

05:55.473 --> 05:58.442
Okay, I turn on a coffee pot, but still.

05:58.476 --> 06:00.143
Look, Reggie, you're here.

06:00.178 --> 06:02.346
The night's young. The music's good.

06:02.380 --> 06:04.548
I will have you home by midnight.

06:04.582 --> 06:07.284
I promise.

06:07.318 --> 06:09.252
(Sighs)

06:09.287 --> 06:11.154
Can I get a club soda?

06:11.189 --> 06:13.357
And, here, you can take this.

06:25.562 --> 06:28.453
_

06:28.940 --> 06:30.107
What?

06:35.046 --> 06:37.748
"Graves"? Uh, no.

06:37.782 --> 06:40.684
I... throwing clay.

06:40.718 --> 06:43.420
Pottery?

06:43.454 --> 06:45.722
My mom is teaching me.

06:47.124 --> 06:48.998
_

06:48.999 --> 06:51.461
Uh, painting mostly.

06:51.496 --> 06:54.197
But, yeah. You?

06:54.870 --> 06:57.496
_

07:07.097 --> 07:09.972
_

07:12.174 --> 07:16.558
_

07:16.559 --> 07:17.754
Okay.

07:17.789 --> 07:19.790
Yeah, I'll check it out.

07:23.594 --> 07:24.995
- Hey.
- Hey there.

07:25.029 --> 07:27.531
I, uh... I heard

07:27.565 --> 07:30.600
that you play. And I started a little

07:30.635 --> 07:32.903
pickup game at lunch. So you should join.

07:32.937 --> 07:37.574
I really haven't played much
since they cut our basketball team.

07:37.608 --> 07:39.810
You know what? If you can
dribble or you can shoot

07:39.844 --> 07:42.579
you're gonna be the M.V.P.
of this team. I promise you.

07:42.613 --> 07:44.548
(Laughing)

07:44.582 --> 07:47.417
So it looks like you're
starting to feel at home here?

07:47.452 --> 07:50.353
Yeah, you know, when
life gives you lemons...

07:50.388 --> 07:52.322
Wait... hey! We're not lemons.

07:52.356 --> 07:53.590
Bad choice of words.

07:53.624 --> 07:55.492
- Bad A.S.L.!
- (Laughing)

07:55.526 --> 07:58.428
Stupid expression anyway because
I don't even like lemonade

07:58.463 --> 08:01.031
- or lemons.
- Oh, that's too bad.

08:01.065 --> 08:04.201
Because my lemon meringue is awesome!

08:04.235 --> 08:06.303
- Mmm! Hey man.
- (Both chuckle)

08:06.337 --> 08:08.271
So no lunchtime hoops.

08:08.306 --> 08:10.907
- What about a little one-on-one after school maybe?
-_

08:16.047 --> 08:19.950
Actually I have plans
after school with Travis.

08:19.984 --> 08:21.952
Do you know Travis? He's deaf?

08:21.986 --> 08:24.721
We're gonna take out my food truck.

08:24.756 --> 08:25.856
All right.

08:36.768 --> 08:37.701
Hey.

08:39.604 --> 08:40.669
So that's it.

08:41.549 --> 08:44.200
_

08:44.201 --> 08:46.309
Does the play take place in...

08:46.344 --> 08:49.146
I don't know the sign for "dungeon"...

08:49.180 --> 08:51.181
Like a castle basement?

08:51.182 --> 08:52.348

08:54.028 --> 08:57.011

08:59.549 --> 09:00.598

09:00.599 --> 09:08.547
_

09:09.767 --> 09:11.768
Uh...

09:13.938 --> 09:16.807
You know what you could do? Projections.

09:16.841 --> 09:21.578
Maybe some Soviet photos
or artwork or something.

09:21.612 --> 09:25.215
Oh! You could hang fabric

09:25.249 --> 09:28.518
in like strips, yeah, something sheer,

09:28.553 --> 09:30.287
that way it has all these layers.

09:31.015 --> 09:31.805
_

09:31.806 --> 09:33.910
_

09:33.911 --> 09:37.961
Students? Students, can
we gather together please?

09:37.995 --> 09:40.230
I'm sorry to inform you that your director

09:40.264 --> 09:43.967
will not be able to continue
with this production.

09:44.001 --> 09:48.805
As you know, Carlton has
brought in some new programs,

09:48.840 --> 09:52.108
and we've had to eliminate others.

09:52.143 --> 09:54.644
And in spite of these changes,

09:54.679 --> 09:57.647
we are still struggling financially.

09:57.682 --> 10:01.551
And, as difficult as it
is for me to tell you this,

10:01.586 --> 10:04.621
we will not be able to do

10:04.655 --> 10:06.823
the spring production this year.

10:10.565 --> 10:12.475
_

10:13.351 --> 10:14.431
_

10:14.432 --> 10:17.234
No, no one has been fired.

10:17.268 --> 10:21.404
We cannot pay the director's
salary and he had to move on.

10:21.439 --> 10:26.076
I thank you all for your energy

10:26.110 --> 10:29.145
and your passion and your understanding.

10:29.180 --> 10:31.281
We'll try again next year.

10:32.917 --> 10:35.886
I'm really sorry.

10:38.866 --> 10:41.574
_

10:41.575 --> 10:43.585
_

11:00.191 --> 11:01.900
_

11:02.915 --> 11:07.800

11:07.801 --> 11:11.413

11:11.414 --> 11:12.855

11:14.340 --> 11:15.190

11:16.292 --> 11:20.870

11:20.871 --> 11:22.759

11:23.400 --> 11:24.655

11:25.440 --> 11:26.970

11:27.771 --> 11:31.462

11:33.080 --> 11:34.332
_

11:34.333 --> 11:38.177
_

11:38.178 --> 11:39.225
_

11:40.375 --> 11:41.818
_

11:45.677 --> 11:49.213
And just like that, the
entire drama program gets cut?

11:49.247 --> 11:50.547
It wasn't ally a whole program.

11:50.582 --> 11:52.449
It was more of an after-school thing.

11:52.484 --> 11:54.284
You know, sweetie, if
you want to paint sets,

11:54.319 --> 11:56.186
there's this really
great program at Buckner.

11:56.221 --> 11:58.255
Well-funded in part by us, I might add.

11:58.289 --> 12:00.924
Dad, I am not going back to Buckner.

12:00.959 --> 12:02.793
That's the bummer about this whole thing.

12:02.827 --> 12:04.928
I was finally starting to fit in at Carlton

12:04.963 --> 12:06.830
and now this is yet another thing

12:06.865 --> 12:09.099
that was killed off by the hearing kids.

12:09.133 --> 12:13.036
That's what they said? They cut the
play because of the hearing program?

12:13.071 --> 12:14.805
They might as well have.

12:14.839 --> 12:17.508
You know what? I'm just... I'll be...

12:17.542 --> 12:20.677
- Back for dinner.
- I'm gonna make a couple of calls about this.

12:20.712 --> 12:23.380
Oh, mom, no. I wouldn't.

12:23.414 --> 12:24.715
Honestly, it's a done deal.

12:24.749 --> 12:27.551
Have you not seen your mother in
action? Nothing is a done deal.

12:27.585 --> 12:30.387
Fighting for arts in public education?

12:30.421 --> 12:32.589
They better watch out.

12:32.624 --> 12:35.392
Hey! Can I talk to you guys?

12:35.426 --> 12:38.128
- Changing of the guards.
- No, stay.

12:38.162 --> 12:42.132
I want to take the food truck
out again tomorrow after school.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.134
Sweetie, we talked about this, okay?

12:44.168 --> 12:47.037
You are too young to be
setting up shop by yourself.

12:47.071 --> 12:50.841
My mom said it was okay. And I won't
be alone. I'm going with Travis.

12:52.143 --> 12:54.144
Regina says it's okay...

12:54.178 --> 12:57.748
Okay, but I want you back here by 9:00.

12:57.782 --> 12:59.016
- Okay, of course.
- All right.

12:59.050 --> 13:00.817
Yes. Thank you!

13:10.530 --> 13:11.828
Hey hey!

13:11.863 --> 13:14.898
Why all the secret signing?

13:14.933 --> 13:16.767
Nothing!

13:18.503 --> 13:20.537
So why Wash U, huh?

13:20.572 --> 13:22.606
- Well, you went there.
- (Chuckles)

13:22.640 --> 13:25.309
I kind of like the idea of
keeping up a family tradition.

13:25.343 --> 13:27.511
Well, your father didn't go there.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.212
He didn't go anywhere.

13:31.182 --> 13:35.319
I guess sometimes family
traditions skip generations.

13:38.056 --> 13:41.258
- So what else do you have?
- What do you mean?

13:41.292 --> 13:43.994
Well, you did two years
of lacrosse and quit.

13:44.028 --> 13:46.830
You have any other extracurriculars?

13:46.864 --> 13:48.865
Are you fluent in any languages?

13:48.900 --> 13:50.968
A.S.L... sign language.

13:51.002 --> 13:54.605
- Ever since Daphne... my sister...
- Yeah, I know who you mean.

13:56.608 --> 13:59.776
Well, music really
takes up most of my time.

13:59.811 --> 14:02.779
- I have a band...
- A rock and roll band, I bet.

14:02.814 --> 14:05.616
Yeah! Well, alternative rock, but yeah.

14:05.650 --> 14:09.286
You know, the kids you're
competing against...

14:09.320 --> 14:12.356
They've been doing solos
with the St. Louis symphony.

14:12.390 --> 14:14.257
- Well, that's...
- And I just read

14:14.292 --> 14:17.060
about a kid whspent his summer

14:17.095 --> 14:19.329
excavating Mayan ruins in Guatemala

14:19.364 --> 14:22.299
and then got the findings
published in an archeology journal.

14:24.369 --> 14:26.336
So from where I sit,

14:26.371 --> 14:29.906
there's just not much
here to distinguish you

14:29.941 --> 14:32.009
from hundreds of other
kids who are applying.

14:32.043 --> 14:35.112
Well, that's why I wanted
to ask for your help.

14:36.981 --> 14:38.015
Can I have some ketchup?

14:42.120 --> 14:44.554
<i>- Do you have any use for this?
- Kathryn: No.</i>

14:44.589 --> 14:45.689
I use an electric.

14:46.758 --> 14:49.493
Oh, um, sorry. Anyway, this meeting?

14:49.527 --> 14:52.462
Yeah, it's this afternoon. And I plan
on going into that principal's office

14:52.497 --> 14:56.433
with a battering ram. And I would
love to have more parents with me.

14:56.467 --> 14:58.502
I am so with you on saving arts programs.

14:58.536 --> 15:01.338
But I can't this afternoon.
I have a job interview.

15:01.372 --> 15:03.607
- That's terrific. Where?
- Answering phones at a spa.

15:03.641 --> 15:06.576
That could be fun... discounted massages?

15:06.611 --> 15:08.478
At this point, I'll take anything.

15:08.513 --> 15:10.480
Because clearly I need
to get out of the house.

15:12.283 --> 15:14.251
So are your arms hurting?

15:14.285 --> 15:15.485
(Sighs)

15:15.520 --> 15:17.087
Not if I don't use them.

15:19.023 --> 15:21.124
And don't worry, I'm not depressed.

15:21.159 --> 15:24.027
I'm just in my robe because I was out late.

15:24.062 --> 15:25.929
Really?! Is this with... ?

15:25.963 --> 15:29.800
Zane. I saw his band last night.

15:29.834 --> 15:31.902
I knew it. Did I call it or what?

15:31.936 --> 15:35.739
You did. I'm just not sure
it's the right call for me.

15:35.773 --> 15:37.841
- Why not?
- Look at my life.

15:37.875 --> 15:41.945
This isn't exactly the time for me to
be hanging out and listening to jazz,

15:41.979 --> 15:45.716
and arguing about art and politics
and then going out for pancakes.

15:45.750 --> 15:47.551
Why not?

15:47.585 --> 15:49.419
Because I'm not in my 20s.

15:49.454 --> 15:51.521
I need a job, a place of my own

15:51.556 --> 15:53.797
and a husband who isn't out
getting other people pregnant.

15:55.526 --> 15:57.394
Sorry.

15:57.428 --> 15:59.496
I know you're going
through a lot right now,

15:59.530 --> 16:02.265
but that's exactly why you need to go out.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.334
See, this is my point. When times are tough

16:04.368 --> 16:07.104
that's when you need creativity the most.

16:07.138 --> 16:09.406
Stimulation, inspiration,

16:09.440 --> 16:13.110
expression... these are
the things that renew us

16:13.144 --> 16:16.113
and keep us growing so we
can fight through another day.

16:16.147 --> 16:18.949
You are ready to talk to
that principal, aren't you?

16:20.118 --> 16:21.184
Yeah.

16:21.219 --> 16:24.187
I appreciate the value
of arts in education,

16:24.222 --> 16:26.723
- Kathryn, I do.
- I know you do...

16:26.758 --> 16:28.119
But that doesn't balance my budget.

16:28.126 --> 16:31.995
And if I don't balance my budget,
then there is no more Carlton.

16:32.029 --> 16:35.565
Then give it to us. Let the
parents take over the play

16:35.600 --> 16:37.601
and you just worry about saving the school.

16:37.635 --> 16:39.836
Please! It would mean so much to them.

16:39.871 --> 16:41.705
We just lost the director.

16:41.739 --> 16:44.508
I don't have a salary
or a production budget.

16:44.542 --> 16:46.710
I think the ship has sailed on this one.

16:48.713 --> 16:50.347
<i>- Daphne: Thank you.
- * I turned the corner</i>

16:50.381 --> 16:52.482

16:52.517 --> 16:56.119

17:27.852 --> 17:29.786
Hi, how can I help you?

17:29.821 --> 17:31.588
Uh, two of the specials.

17:31.622 --> 17:33.523
Okay, spicy or regular?

17:33.558 --> 17:34.858
- Spicy.
- Spicy.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.650
_

17:39.651 --> 17:41.361
_

17:41.532 --> 17:42.666
Yeah.

17:42.700 --> 17:45.302
- Is he throwing gang signs at you?
- No no,

17:45.336 --> 17:47.671
- it's sign language. We're deaf.
- For real?

17:47.705 --> 17:50.340
- But you heard what I said.
- I read your lips.

17:50.374 --> 17:51.474
Cool.

17:51.509 --> 17:54.110
Who do you work for? I've
never seen this truck before.

17:54.145 --> 17:55.512
- Oh, it's mine.
- Yours?

17:55.546 --> 17:57.247
- Mm-hmm.
- Damn.

17:57.281 --> 18:00.016
I can hear and see perfect...
all I got is an old bike.

18:00.051 --> 18:01.384
(Laughs)

18:03.287 --> 18:05.288
Hey, you know what you
should do? Put your picture

18:05.323 --> 18:07.958
on the side of the truck,
call it "deaf hot tacos."

18:07.992 --> 18:10.927
With a face like yours, guys will
be lining up around the block.

18:10.962 --> 18:13.096
Thanks. Enjoy.

18:18.777 --> 18:21.212
_

18:22.707 --> 18:25.675
Ooh, scary.

18:25.710 --> 18:27.043
I'm sorry about the mess.

18:27.078 --> 18:28.945
I promise I'm going to clean it up.

18:28.980 --> 18:32.515
No, it's fine. It's nice
having you work here.

18:34.518 --> 18:36.887
I hate to bother you
while you're in "the zone,"

18:36.921 --> 18:38.788
but I just wanted to tell you

18:38.823 --> 18:41.491
that some wonderfully
committed Carlton parent

18:41.525 --> 18:43.526
spoke to principal rose this afternoon

18:43.561 --> 18:46.429
and it looks like the play is back on.

18:46.464 --> 18:49.466
- Seriously? Who did that?
- Me.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.235
That's amazing! Thank you.

18:52.270 --> 18:54.404
Rehearsals start tomorrow after school,

18:54.438 --> 18:56.273
and I am so excited!

18:56.307 --> 18:59.042
Why are you so excited?

18:59.076 --> 19:03.179
Well, as you know, they had to
cut the salary of the director

19:03.214 --> 19:06.216
because of the budget, so it
became a volunteer position.

19:06.250 --> 19:09.052
- You volunteered.
- Yeah.

19:09.086 --> 19:10.987
It's just a stopgap measure.

19:11.022 --> 19:14.824
Are you really qualified
to do something like this?

19:14.859 --> 19:17.961
I've been in a lot of plays and I directed
the holiday pageant at the church...

19:17.995 --> 19:20.764
Right, uh... yeah, I know.

19:21.933 --> 19:23.733
I'm sure it's gonna be fine.

19:25.536 --> 19:28.438
Hey, how did it go with your grandfather?

19:29.540 --> 19:30.807
Uh, actually not so good.

19:30.841 --> 19:33.643
What do you mean? Is he going
to make the call or what?

19:33.678 --> 19:36.446
I don't know. He didn't say.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.616
Huh. So what did he say?

19:39.650 --> 19:42.452
That I am not Wash U material.

19:42.486 --> 19:47.157
- He said that?
- Well yeah, that I'm...

19:47.191 --> 19:49.392
Like everybody else that's applying.

19:49.427 --> 19:51.428
Did you tell him about your music?

19:51.462 --> 19:55.198
I tried, but he just
kept calling it a hobby.

19:55.232 --> 19:57.167
Honestly, I don't even care.

19:57.201 --> 19:59.069
Okay, you know what? Listen to me.

19:59.103 --> 20:01.338
Your music, your band... these are things

20:01.372 --> 20:03.907
that are going to set
your application apart.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.075
And your grandfather...

20:08.746 --> 20:10.747
(Clears throat) he's not the kind of man

20:10.781 --> 20:12.048
to offer a lot of approval.

20:12.083 --> 20:14.651
He's got his own ideas

20:14.685 --> 20:16.553
about how things should go.

20:16.587 --> 20:19.622
And if you want to go your
own way... like, let's say,

20:19.657 --> 20:22.692
turn down a football scholarship
to the University of Iowa

20:22.727 --> 20:24.661
to play baseball in the major leagues...

20:24.695 --> 20:26.730
no amount of success

20:26.764 --> 20:28.531
will make him come around.

20:28.566 --> 20:30.700
All he sees

20:30.735 --> 20:33.269
is that you didn't do it his way.

20:36.440 --> 20:39.376
Well, if I did it his way, I'd
better start high school again.

20:39.410 --> 20:41.244
Now you listen to me.

20:41.278 --> 20:43.980
This afternoon, you
put it out of your head.

20:44.015 --> 20:47.984
You finish those applications.
He does not get to derail you.

20:48.019 --> 20:50.887
- But, dad, I...
- No buts, Toby.

20:50.921 --> 20:53.289
You get those applications in.

21:01.903 --> 21:03.137
So, what was the theory again?

21:04.112 --> 21:06.313
Family connections are gonna
help Toby get into college?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.282
- Did he talk to your dad?
- Oh yeah.

21:08.316 --> 21:11.251
Just long enough to start thinking
he doesn't have a shot at getting in.

21:11.286 --> 21:14.855
- How did he do that?
- I know exactly how he did it.

21:17.192 --> 21:20.794
Peering over his glasses like
you both know it's the truth,

21:20.829 --> 21:23.063
and if you can't admit it, you're a coward.

21:23.098 --> 21:25.165
Okay,

21:25.200 --> 21:27.134
we know Toby.

21:27.168 --> 21:31.038
He may get pushed off
his axis for a day or two,

21:31.072 --> 21:32.806
but he'll think about it

21:32.841 --> 21:34.775
and he'll come back stronger than ever.

21:34.809 --> 21:37.644
- You sure about that?
- He's not like you, John.

21:37.679 --> 21:39.880
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means he didn't grow up

21:39.948 --> 21:42.383
having to defend himself all the time.

21:42.417 --> 21:45.386
He has a loving father

21:45.420 --> 21:47.388
who supports him. He'll take it in

21:47.422 --> 21:49.656
and then remember who is.

21:51.259 --> 21:53.260
Reggie, come on, it's
not even midnight yet.

21:53.294 --> 21:55.262
What, is your car gonna
turn into a pumpkin?

21:55.296 --> 21:57.297
Have you seen my car? Because
that would be an improvement.

21:57.332 --> 22:01.135
Okay, have you had the
Martinis at the green mill?

22:01.169 --> 22:04.104
- Because if you haven't...
- Zane, I gotta get home.

22:04.139 --> 22:06.440
Do you understand?
Responsibility, daughter,

22:06.474 --> 22:10.177
- crappy jobs to apply for.
- All of which will still be there

22:10.211 --> 22:12.312
- after the Martini.
- (Laughs)

22:12.347 --> 22:15.249
<i>Have you even had a day job?</i>

22:15.283 --> 22:17.151
Uh, hell yes.

22:17.185 --> 22:20.187
Reupholstering furniture in my
Uncle's shop. I was miserable.

22:20.221 --> 22:22.990
By the way, it's not like I'm
living a life of leisure here.

22:23.024 --> 22:25.092
But it's a hell of a lot more fun.

22:26.928 --> 22:28.028
(Sighs)

22:28.062 --> 22:30.063
You know what?

22:31.966 --> 22:35.068
Maybe I'm just not in a fun
place in my life right now.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.970
Uh-oh.

22:37.005 --> 22:39.473
You live in Oz,

22:39.507 --> 22:41.809
and I am in Kansas

22:41.843 --> 22:44.611
in, like, the middle of a tornado.

22:44.646 --> 22:47.581
- Hold on...
- And honestly? I don't even like jazz all that much.

22:47.615 --> 22:49.616
(Chuckles)

22:49.651 --> 22:51.585
There she is.

22:51.619 --> 22:54.254
There's the girl I remember.

22:54.289 --> 22:56.423
I think she is long gone.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.459
You don't think I haven't changed either?

22:58.493 --> 23:01.361
I have two grown girls. I have an ex-wife.

23:01.396 --> 23:04.097
I'm putting together gigs week to week.

23:04.132 --> 23:06.099
I know.

23:07.302 --> 23:09.903
And I really like hanging out with you.

23:09.938 --> 23:11.839
But...

23:11.873 --> 23:13.907
I gotta deal with the tornado.

23:22.784 --> 23:24.084
(Sighs)

23:28.756 --> 23:30.624
Take care of yourself.

23:50.245 --> 23:52.079
(Exhales)

24:33.855 --> 24:36.456
- Hey there.
- Damn, those tacos were good.

24:36.491 --> 24:38.625
- Thanks.
- What do you put in them?

24:38.660 --> 24:40.360
My secret ingredient.

24:40.395 --> 24:43.263
Hey, how do you say
"taco" in sign language?

24:43.298 --> 24:45.332
Just how it looks... like this.

24:45.366 --> 24:47.134
That's cool.

24:47.168 --> 24:49.169
- What's your name?
- Daphne.

24:49.203 --> 24:51.371
So, Daphne,

24:51.406 --> 24:53.273
you wanna go out sometime?

24:55.043 --> 24:56.209
<i>(Faint rattling)</i>

24:56.244 --> 24:57.911
Uh...

25:00.214 --> 25:01.815
Do...

25:03.084 --> 25:05.719
No, don't! No!

25:05.753 --> 25:09.022
- (Screaming)

25:10.858 --> 25:12.693

25:12.727 --> 25:15.762
(Sobs, gasping)

25:37.338 --> 25:39.080
_

25:40.434 --> 25:42.599
_

25:43.900 --> 25:45.577
_

25:46.622 --> 25:49.509
_

25:49.510 --> 25:51.407
_

25:51.408 --> 25:53.407
_

25:55.555 --> 25:58.174
_

25:58.175 --> 26:00.685
_

26:05.861 --> 26:07.170
_

26:09.191 --> 26:10.321
_

26:11.120 --> 26:12.387
_

26:14.634 --> 26:15.873
_

26:16.784 --> 26:19.677
- _
- _

26:19.678 --> 26:21.844
_

26:29.262 --> 26:31.330
Hey.

26:31.364 --> 26:33.999
How did it go the park?
Did you have enough shrimp?

26:35.001 --> 26:36.969
Yeah, we had enough.

26:37.003 --> 26:39.238
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, um,

26:39.272 --> 26:41.974
I'm just tired. I'm going to go to bed.

26:42.008 --> 26:43.075
Okay.

26:45.245 --> 26:47.813
(Sighs)

26:51.906 --> 26:54.447
_

26:54.821 --> 26:56.989
Looks like it.

26:57.969 --> 27:00.040
_

27:00.042 --> 27:02.561
Hello, everybody! Hello!

27:02.595 --> 27:04.697
Um, gather around, please.

27:04.731 --> 27:06.765
Come on, don't be shy.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.767
My name is Kathryn.

27:08.802 --> 27:12.538
- And let's put on a play!
-_

27:15.342 --> 27:17.509
I know that you already

27:17.544 --> 27:21.580
started rehearsals...

27:21.614 --> 27:23.382
Um, uh,

27:23.416 --> 27:25.250
this is so exciting.

27:25.285 --> 27:28.153
I have my own interpreter.

27:29.752 --> 27:31.578
_

27:32.058 --> 27:34.860
We're all storytellers, right?

27:34.894 --> 27:39.865
So please, join me for the
story of Romeo and Juliet.

27:42.135 --> 27:44.970
Okay.

27:45.004 --> 27:47.639
This is the story ball.

27:47.674 --> 27:49.942
When you hold it, you have

27:49.976 --> 27:52.511
the power over the story.

27:52.545 --> 27:55.514
Okay? Oh wait, I see...

27:55.548 --> 27:58.550
You have to sign and hold the
ball... that's not gonna work.

27:58.585 --> 28:00.786
So okay.

28:02.422 --> 28:03.522
Let's make it

28:03.556 --> 28:05.657
- an imaginary ball. Yeah?
-_

28:07.594 --> 28:11.163
All right, here, Bay, catch!

28:12.165 --> 28:15.534
Okay, uh... once there was

28:15.568 --> 28:18.370
a girl named Juliet

28:18.405 --> 28:21.140
and she did not want to

28:21.174 --> 28:25.043
marry the guy she was supposed to marry...

28:27.380 --> 28:30.115
<i>Interpreter: "So she got into a spaceship</i>

28:30.150 --> 28:32.084
and starts heading off into space."

28:32.118 --> 28:34.720
"We're not talking about
going off into space!

28:34.754 --> 28:36.188
That's stupid."

28:38.691 --> 28:41.059
<i>"The Soviet Union? That wasn't stupid?"</i>

28:41.094 --> 28:42.795
Wait, hold it, hold it.

28:42.829 --> 28:45.964
We don't use the word
"stupid"! All ideas are welcome!

28:45.999 --> 28:48.567
Come on, everybody. Okay... excuse me?

28:48.601 --> 28:50.602
Everyone, come back, please.

28:50.637 --> 28:52.871
You... in the blue? Can
someone get her attention?

28:52.906 --> 28:56.375
Please. Okay, now who has the ball?

28:56.409 --> 28:58.377
Who has the imaginary ball?

28:59.746 --> 29:01.413
You stay here, okay?

29:07.620 --> 29:10.189
- Hello.
- Hey.

29:11.257 --> 29:13.225
You and Toby in the same week.

29:13.259 --> 29:16.495
- It must be my birthday.
- Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.

29:18.331 --> 29:21.400
You know, I don't even hear
from you people for six years,

29:21.434 --> 29:24.169
and the day you show up,
you ask me for a favor?

29:24.204 --> 29:26.071
Calling you wasn't my idea.

29:26.105 --> 29:27.940
I tried to talk him out of it.

29:27.974 --> 29:29.975
- I thought we had a nice meeting.
- Oh yeah?

29:30.009 --> 29:32.177
Is that what you think?
You think it was nice?

29:32.212 --> 29:33.946
He asked you to make one call.

29:33.980 --> 29:36.048
- I know what he asked me.
- Then why couldn't you do it

29:36.082 --> 29:38.650
without all the little digs?

29:38.685 --> 29:40.018
I told him I'd make the call

29:40.053 --> 29:42.688
<i>after he beefed up his resume.</i>

29:42.722 --> 29:44.723
You weren't supposed to critique him.

29:44.757 --> 29:47.459
He wasn't asking for your opinion.

29:47.494 --> 29:48.894
Maybe, just maybe,

29:48.928 --> 29:50.863
he wanted a little support.

29:50.897 --> 29:53.632
He's got some stiff competition.
If he can't take that...

29:53.666 --> 29:56.368
Oh yeah... yeah right. Yeah.

29:56.402 --> 29:59.238
The Bill Kennish no-bull straight talk.

29:59.272 --> 30:02.207
Well, thank you for being the only person

30:02.242 --> 30:04.176
to tell it to him like it really is.

30:04.210 --> 30:06.245
You turned out all right.

30:06.279 --> 30:08.447
You can't take credit for me.

30:08.481 --> 30:11.250
What I've done, I've done in spite of you.

30:11.284 --> 30:13.118
(Chuckles)

30:13.152 --> 30:16.288
You came all the way out here to
pick that same old fight with me?

30:16.322 --> 30:18.891
Some things just never change, do they?

30:20.860 --> 30:23.795
You know,

30:23.830 --> 30:26.698
every once in a while I ask
myself if I did the right thing

30:26.733 --> 30:28.967
keeping you out of my kids' lives.

30:29.002 --> 30:32.604
And I just want to thank you
for removing any of that doubt

30:32.639 --> 30:34.506
once and for all.

30:41.405 --> 30:43.862
Yes. Hello. I was hoping to speak with Cindy.

30:46.026 --> 30:47.994
Hi, Cindy, this is Regina Vasquez.

30:48.028 --> 30:50.696
We met yesterday about
the receptionist position?

30:52.666 --> 30:54.834
Oh, you filled it.

30:56.537 --> 30:57.770
Uh-huh, right.

30:57.805 --> 31:00.606
Well, I mean, I don't have
specific receptionist experience

31:00.641 --> 31:02.922
but I ran my own business for
12 years, which I thought...

31:06.680 --> 31:08.714
Well, if you have any other openings...

31:11.218 --> 31:12.618
(Sighs)

31:12.653 --> 31:14.554
Well, I will think about that.

31:14.588 --> 31:16.155
Thanks so much.

31:17.324 --> 31:19.091
(Groans)

31:26.016 --> 31:28.948
_

31:28.949 --> 31:30.490
_

31:30.491 --> 31:34.858
_

31:34.859 --> 31:36.812
_

31:36.813 --> 31:40.710
_

31:40.711 --> 31:42.363
_

31:42.364 --> 31:45.503
- _
- _

31:47.240 --> 31:48.488
_

31:49.920 --> 31:51.250
_

31:53.123 --> 31:55.890
_

31:56.485 --> 31:57.991
_

32:01.702 --> 32:04.203
Kathryn wanted you to have this.

32:08.208 --> 32:11.344
They are the outlines to the stage.

32:11.378 --> 32:14.347
She's looking for new set-design ideas.

32:17.251 --> 32:19.218
<i>"But Bay already had a great idea."</i>

32:19.253 --> 32:23.022
- It was just some projections.
- Oh, that sounds great!

32:23.056 --> 32:25.958
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It just hadn't come up yet.

32:25.993 --> 32:28.027
Oh. We'll talk about it at home.

32:28.061 --> 32:31.797
But I want you to know
that I am open to all ideas.

32:40.020 --> 32:41.392
_

32:41.775 --> 32:44.744
Yeah. That's my mom.

32:46.166 --> 32:49.430
_

32:49.616 --> 32:51.817
She just wanted to.

32:51.852 --> 32:54.387
(Sighs)

32:54.938 --> 32:57.639
_

32:57.640 --> 33:00.462
_

33:00.463 --> 33:05.164
That's my other mom. This mom
doesn't really have a life of her own,

33:05.198 --> 33:08.167
so she's always putting herself into mine.

33:17.110 --> 33:19.145
(Exhales)

33:22.416 --> 33:24.116
Mom.

33:26.253 --> 33:28.187
Is that what you think of me?

33:28.221 --> 33:30.089
That I don't have a life?

33:30.123 --> 33:33.659
That I'm someone you need to apologize for?

33:33.694 --> 33:34.860
No.

33:34.895 --> 33:36.696
And to who?

33:36.730 --> 33:39.932
That mean girl? Her opinion
means that much to you?

33:39.967 --> 33:42.702
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

33:42.736 --> 33:44.637
I have feelings, Bay.

33:44.671 --> 33:47.673
I am not just a robot
who just provides for you

33:47.708 --> 33:50.443
and then disappears
until you need me again.

33:50.477 --> 33:51.644
Mom... mom!

33:55.282 --> 33:56.549
That's not what I think.

33:56.583 --> 33:59.218
You think that because I am not artistic

33:59.252 --> 34:01.454
or independent enough for you,

34:01.488 --> 34:04.190
you don't have to be
kind to me or supportive?

34:06.126 --> 34:07.994
Bay, I did this for you.

34:08.027 --> 34:09.395
No, you didn't.

34:09.429 --> 34:11.931
I'm sorry, mom, but you did this for you.

34:11.965 --> 34:14.000
You asked me to save your drama club!

34:14.034 --> 34:16.135
I didn't ask you to
join it! It was my thing.

34:19.840 --> 34:23.042
In two years you're going to
be out of the house forever.

34:25.045 --> 34:27.913
And this that we have together right now?

34:27.947 --> 34:29.715
It's going to be gone.

34:31.752 --> 34:34.620
I just wanted to make
it last a little longer.

34:43.630 --> 34:45.563
(Sighs)

35:00.693 --> 35:01.989
_

35:01.990 --> 35:02.990
_

35:07.132 --> 35:09.554
_

35:11.785 --> 35:13.757
_

35:21.048 --> 35:23.070
_

35:23.071 --> 35:24.967
_

35:34.334 --> 35:35.923
_

35:43.740 --> 35:46.148
_

35:47.902 --> 35:52.200
_

35:52.201 --> 35:56.078
_

35:59.231 --> 36:02.202
_

36:09.713 --> 36:11.469
_

36:11.470 --> 36:13.718
_

36:15.521 --> 36:18.676
_

36:18.677 --> 36:21.473
_

36:23.900 --> 36:26.262
_

36:28.856 --> 36:30.690
(Exhales sharply)

36:35.863 --> 36:37.630
(Kathryn sighs)

36:39.900 --> 36:41.601
Hey.

36:42.803 --> 36:46.372
You'd think I'd have learned
to label these buttons.

36:46.406 --> 36:48.441
It's so hard to find a match.

36:49.676 --> 36:51.611
I'm sorry about what I said to Natalie.

36:53.680 --> 36:56.215
I know that you have a life.

36:57.451 --> 36:59.418
You know you weren't wrong

36:59.453 --> 37:03.155
about me barging in on your drama club.

37:03.190 --> 37:05.224
<i>You didn't ask for that.</i>

37:05.259 --> 37:08.027
And as soon as I can find a
replacement, I'll step down.

37:08.061 --> 37:10.229
That's not what I want.

37:13.267 --> 37:16.269
Sometimes it's not just
about what you want.

37:16.303 --> 37:19.071
I know.

37:21.975 --> 37:24.977
I'm sorry. I feel so bad.

37:30.984 --> 37:33.686
Honey, come here.

37:35.722 --> 37:39.492
You are not the first
daughter to torment her mother.

37:39.526 --> 37:40.860
(Both laugh)

37:40.894 --> 37:43.663
I'll get over it.

37:43.697 --> 37:46.499
(Sniffles)

37:50.404 --> 37:53.439
- But I'm not sure I really like this Natalie.
- (Chuckles)

37:53.473 --> 37:56.509
I didn't either... at first,

37:56.543 --> 37:59.178
but she'll come around.

37:59.212 --> 38:01.414
Mmm.

38:01.448 --> 38:04.116
I can't wait. (Laughs)

38:05.285 --> 38:07.386
Hey, I got your text.

38:07.421 --> 38:09.255
Hey. So,

38:09.289 --> 38:11.223
I have been in touch with Darryl,

38:11.258 --> 38:13.392
my old batting coach with the
Royals. He's a Wash U alum.

38:13.427 --> 38:16.062
Turns out his brother is a Dean over there.

38:16.096 --> 38:18.264
<i>He wants to sit down with
you and call his brother</i>

38:18.298 --> 38:20.199
who's got a little pull.

38:20.233 --> 38:23.002
- Oh.
- C'mon! This is great news.

38:23.036 --> 38:25.738
Yeah, it's just...

38:25.772 --> 38:27.740
I don't know. I've been thinking.

38:27.774 --> 38:30.943
I only applied to Wash U because
my counselor said I should.

38:30.978 --> 38:34.680
- If you don't want to go there...
- Any college really.

38:34.715 --> 38:38.718
I mean I only applied because
that's what you're supposed to do...

38:38.752 --> 38:41.721
Ah, no no. It's about growing up

38:41.755 --> 38:43.489
and starting life as an adult.

38:43.523 --> 38:45.658
But college isn't the only way to do that.

38:45.692 --> 38:47.827
You said you never grew
up faster than that summer

38:47.861 --> 38:51.430
you played baseball for that
Cape COD league when you were 17.

38:51.465 --> 38:54.667
- I was on a different path.
- I don't even know if I have a path.

38:54.701 --> 38:56.569
See that right there?

38:56.603 --> 38:59.538
That is exactly what
your grandfather wanted:

38:59.573 --> 39:02.608
get under your skin and
make you doubt yourself.

39:02.642 --> 39:05.478
Dad, this isn't about you
and grandpa and who's right.

39:05.512 --> 39:08.180
It's about me and what I want.

39:08.215 --> 39:11.183
You know what, it's okay to
be nervous or even have doubts.

39:11.218 --> 39:13.252
College is a big change,

39:13.286 --> 39:16.055
but you have the entire
summer ahead of you.

39:16.089 --> 39:18.124
Do what you want...

39:18.158 --> 39:20.393
travel, play music, loaf around.

39:20.427 --> 39:22.928
No pressure.

39:22.963 --> 39:25.231
You do not have to make
up your mind right now.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.968
Well, I have made up my mind.

39:30.037 --> 39:31.904
I'm not going to college next year.

39:36.276 --> 39:39.712
Hey. So did you do

39:39.746 --> 39:41.781
a set design idea?

39:42.568 --> 39:45.063
_

39:45.752 --> 39:46.852
Oh.

39:46.853 --> 39:48.810
_

39:48.922 --> 39:51.624
No, I get it.

40:01.535 --> 40:04.370
We have a pretty serious situation here.

40:04.404 --> 40:08.574
The school has no money
for any of this... nothing.

40:08.608 --> 40:11.644
Not for sets, not for costumes,

40:11.678 --> 40:13.579
not for interpreters

40:13.613 --> 40:16.315
and definitely not for drama teachers.

40:17.517 --> 40:20.186
So we need to be doing this,

40:20.220 --> 40:23.055
all of us,

40:23.090 --> 40:25.224
solely out of love.

40:27.127 --> 40:29.228
Love for the theater,

40:29.262 --> 40:33.132
and love for working together as a team...

40:33.166 --> 40:35.935
each of us with different talents

40:35.969 --> 40:38.237
and different ideas, coming together

40:38.271 --> 40:41.207
to create something that just might be...

40:43.076 --> 40:44.877
great.

40:46.246 --> 40:49.982
So if you're ready to do this with me,

40:50.016 --> 40:52.818
then stay. And if you're not,

40:52.853 --> 40:54.153
then it's time to go.

41:05.832 --> 41:08.567
Good. Then let's get started.

41:08.602 --> 41:11.504
I've made some copies
of the opening scene...

41:12.572 --> 41:13.906
and here you go.

41:25.519 --> 41:28.754
<i>- Zane: Hey.
- Did I miss your whole set?</i>

41:28.788 --> 41:30.623
Perfect timing actually.

41:30.657 --> 41:32.725
We were just about to
go get something to eat.

41:32.759 --> 41:34.894
You guys go. I'm not that hungry.

41:34.928 --> 41:36.829
<i>Bartender: Aw man, jackpot!</i>

41:36.863 --> 41:39.632
Somebody left like half a Bordeaux.

41:39.666 --> 41:41.600
It's a $300 bottle, people.

41:41.635 --> 41:43.702
- Who's in?
- Can't pass that up.

41:43.737 --> 41:45.571
Regina?

41:49.876 --> 41:52.912
You know, you look fantastic tonight.

41:52.946 --> 41:55.481
<i>Where are you guys headed?</i>

41:56.716 --> 41:59.585
Uh, Emerald City.

41:59.619 --> 42:03.789
<i>* it's just a vacation... *</i>

42:06.893 --> 42:09.862
<i>- bartender: Nice, right?
- Beautiful.</i>

42:09.896 --> 42:11.797
Guess you're done with that cleanse.

42:11.831 --> 42:14.867
All done.

42:14.901 --> 42:17.536
So, Regina, what do you do?

42:17.571 --> 42:19.772
Cosmetology for a lot of years,

42:19.806 --> 42:23.609
but I'm open to something new right now.

42:23.643 --> 42:24.643
Regina came here

42:24.678 --> 42:26.545
ever since T.J. was running it.

42:26.580 --> 42:29.748
- No.
- (Regina chuckles)

42:29.783 --> 42:31.850
You're the one that can dance, right?

42:31.918 --> 42:34.553
- Oh, she can?
- I've heard of her!

42:34.588 --> 42:36.555
(Conversation fades)
