it's like the future is music

like it's from 2002.

industry sort of shit.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.193
Little trick, little trick.

01:58.800 --> 02:02.554
The first rule of the music industry
is that the music doesn't matter.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.833
It's about who you know.

02:04.880 --> 02:09.078
That's why it's very useful to have
a manager like me... I mean,

02:08.400 --> 02:11.710
I don't know anyone, but they don't
know that I don't know anyone.

<i>would do it.</i>

Are we having a meeting?

Yes!

10:27.520 --> 10:28.555
So is this your office?

10:30.840 --> 10:33.229

10:40.040 --> 10:42.110
It's fine. I'm just gonna get you to
sit back and relax,

10:50.280 --> 10:51.759
Yeah, no, I won't let it get in
your eyes, that's fine.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.395
I'm keeping it back.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.150
I heard the government put like
chemicals in shampoo...

10:56.720 --> 10:57.948

What are you using?

11:20.440 --> 11:21.668
Yeah, just read it out the back.

we need to start questioning it.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.508
Sorry about that.

18:33.720 --> 18:39.352
Yeah? How about that?
Have fun cleaning that up.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.793
I told you I was gonna do
the talking.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.549
I know, I know, but I just did a
little bit of business.

18:37.720 --> 18:38.675
That's why you fucked it up.

18:38.960 --> 18:39.949
I thought you knew him?
You said you know him.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.472
I did know him.
He was showing off.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.394
Hi. Are you waiting for someone?

19:00.240 --> 19:02.470
- Yeah.
- Come in and wait, that's fine.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.590
DJ BEATS: <i>Roche thought it would be a
<i>good idea actually</i></i>

19:03.960 --> 19:05.188
<i>if we went on a
<i>parenting course.</i></i>

19:05.240 --> 19:06.309
<i>It was when he asked</i>

19:07.640 --> 19:09.790
whether babies ever come out
the arsehole by accident.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.958
Well, that's a simple mistake
to make,

19:11.160 --> 19:12.718
they are very close to each other.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.148
Yeah, I've heard that before.

19:19.920 --> 19:24.516
Hi. I'm Tina. I'm 25 weeks,
and we're having a boy, little Tyler.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.715
Oh! Named him already,
congratulations.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.632
All right, I'm Darren.
Obviously, I'm not pregnant

19:28.760 --> 19:31.513
but I was involved in the process.
So you know!

19:33.160 --> 19:37.358
- Hello, I'm Jack.
- Hello, I'm Laura. I'm 23 weeks,

19:35.680 --> 19:37.989
and we've actually decided to
keep it a surprise.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.754
Oh! Good for you. Lots of people do.
Not everyone wants

19:39.960 --> 19:41.393
everyone to know,
so there we go.

19:44.240 --> 19:48.199
- Hello. My name's Kevin Bates.
- Hello, Kevin.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.998
AKA Beats. AKA the Albino Seal.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.155
Right, so, erm...

19:53.520 --> 19:57.638
And this is a picture of my partner
Roche.

19:54.840 --> 19:55.875
Right.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.755
She's not here yet,
'cause she had an emergency at work.

20:00.440 --> 20:03.159
- Ah, so she is joining us.
- Yeah, she is coming.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.275
That's all right, man, you can have
a go on mine if she doesn't turn up.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.392
(CHUCKLES) Love that.
What's your name, mate?

20:06.920 --> 20:08.831
- Darren. This is Tina.
- Hiya.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.312
Hello, Tina. Don't worry,
I don't want to have a go on you.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.913
(CHUCKLES) I mean, I would if...
And you weren't...

20:17.120 --> 20:18.712
I'm afraid we're going to have to
start now.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.235
How are we getting on?

20:19.960 --> 20:21.393
Nearly done aren't we, Steves?

20:22.800 --> 20:25.234
What? Is it radio meeting? Sorry.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.518
It's all right. It's good that
you're so comfortable.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.278
I get weird about haircuts.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.912
I took a load of valium earlier
just to calm me down.

20:33.840 --> 20:37.549
Ah. Why not, eh?
Just get him finished up...

20:35.040 --> 20:36.029
Yeah, yeah.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.229
...and out. And we'II... cool.
- Okay. Great.

20:41.360 --> 20:42.554
Okay.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.998
Always better
with a bit of gel, innit?

20:49.760 --> 20:55.392
Just gonna... This is where you'll
really see the transformation.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.154
STEVES: Wow.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.998
Okay. So, would you like
to just hold your baby

21:04.280 --> 21:06.953
how you think
a baby would be held.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.551
Just support the neck, Kevin.

21:09.880 --> 21:10.835
Doing a lovely job there.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.592
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.073
- Oh, hello. You must be...
- It's Roche.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.314
- Hello there.
- Hi.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.997
My dad used to do that one...
Wahey!

21:20.560 --> 21:23.791
Kevin! We are treating these dolls
like babies at the moment so...

21:21.840 --> 21:22.909
Yeah, I know, but they're not.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.999
INTERVIEWER: <i>Do you have high</i>
<i>expectations then,</i>

21:26.120 --> 21:28.350
<i>for Beats, like at the birth time?</i>

21:29.680 --> 21:32.831
I have high expectations of Kevin,

21:33.680 --> 21:37.275
but I also am aware
of what Kevin will be able to do.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.551
<i>So, in the sense that,</i>

21:38.520 --> 21:41.080
I have high expectations of what
I would like him to do,

21:42.440 --> 21:46.035
but I have very low expectations
of what I actually expect him to do.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.551
But, babies,
do they like jokes and that?

21:47.880 --> 21:50.474
You know, like, not proper jokes,
but joke stuff.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.518
Babies like to laugh, of course,
like everybody,

21:53.520 --> 21:55.431
they've got the same emotions as us.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.038
MICHE: Brilliant. Wow!

21:57.760 --> 21:59.910
I like how you do the little space
in between each strand.

21:58.920 --> 21:59.875
Do you like that?

22:00.960 --> 22:02.234
Yeah. It's my own
little technique actually.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.078
Can I ask you if I can get a
picture of the hair

22:05.280 --> 22:06.235
just to put on my gallery?

22:09.360 --> 22:12.318
Yeah, yeah, model shot. Modelling.

22:10.880 --> 22:12.029
Smile.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.319
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

22:15.720 --> 22:18.280
Great. Okay, perfect.
So I think we're all done now.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.354
Oh, yeah, take that off, yeah.

22:23.480 --> 22:26.074
- Great, I love it, I really love it.
- VIP treatment.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.598
All right. Do you want
me to give you this ting now or...

22:29.760 --> 22:32.593
- No, no. Just do it later.
- All right.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.269
Okay. Wow!

22:33.840 --> 22:36.308
You look like a, erm...
like a footballer or something.

22:36.600 --> 22:39.160
Proper celebrity look. Wow!

22:38.880 --> 22:40.233
Better with the hat on though, innit?

22:41.240 --> 22:42.639
Look like a crackhead
without the hat.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.235
Ah. All right, see you later.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.756
- Bye.
- Thank you.

22:49.000 --> 22:49.955
TANYA: Bye.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.513
- STEVES: Bye.
- Oh, wow!

22:59.640 --> 23:02.552
He just put the hat straight on.
What's he doing?

23:06.240 --> 23:09.391
He smelt of drugs.
He smelt of drugs.

23:09.240 --> 23:12.038
Just seems pointless. You can't sell
things on the internet.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.749
How would you get the money?

23:13.240 --> 23:15.674
Mate, trust me, okay?
Everyone's doing it right now.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.516
People don't wanna go to the shop
to buy music,

23:17.440 --> 23:19.158
people don't wanna go to labels,
mate.

23:20.520 --> 23:23.159
It's all about downloading, yeah,
the internet.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.798
Nah, I still reckon the internet's
going to blow over any day...

23:25.960 --> 23:27.791
Nah, mate. Trust me, okay?
Think about it.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.470
Right now we live in
the "now" generation!

23:33.600 --> 23:38.594
People want everything now!
Instant coffee! Fast food!

23:35.520 --> 23:37.238
Fast internet! Even fast sex.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.431
Three minutes max.
You know what I mean?

23:39.720 --> 23:41.631
Get it in, stick it back out,
clean yourself up

23:41.520 --> 23:43.112
and get the hell out!
You know what I mean?

23:43.520 --> 23:45.317
I don't even know what you're
talking about anymore.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.992
Like, you started off and then
always just goes back down to sex.

23:53.720 --> 23:58.475
Yeah, sorry. I'm just very sexually
frustrated at the moment.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.313
Yeah, it's...

24:01.400 --> 24:03.630
- You did great today, Miche!
- Thank you.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.591
Looks like we've got a natural
hairdresser in our midst!

24:05.960 --> 24:07.279
Aw, thanks!

24:09.280 --> 24:12.397
You did well actually because he was
a bit of a tricky customer.

24:12.960 --> 24:16.396
He was off his face actually.
Druggie eyes, I know that.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.598
Yeah, well you know what they say,

24:16.480 --> 24:17.879
you've got to be able to handle
people from all walks of life

24:19.480 --> 24:22.278
as a hairdresser.
So, just doing my job really.

24:24.560 --> 24:29.429
That is very true. Next time you
come in, Mrs. Beaumont,

24:26.560 --> 24:28.357
it might be our Miche here
cutting your hair!

24:29.600 --> 24:32.433
Oh, my God. I would love that.
I've never cut long hair before.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.197
It'd be really a dream come true.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.516
Have you ever thought of going
a bit shorter?

24:39.760 --> 24:41.910
So what I want you to do
is open your nappies

24:44.200 --> 24:48.432
and I want you to tell me whether you
think you've got a healthy nappy

24:46.200 --> 24:47.713
or an unhealthy nappy.

24:49.920 --> 24:53.435
(GROANS) That's mental. Is that real?

24:52.760 --> 24:54.591
No it's not real. Calm down!

24:55.000 --> 24:56.877
Excuse me, is this real?

24:57.880 --> 25:00.553
No, Kevin, it's not real, it's just
for the purposes of the exercise.

25:06.520 --> 25:07.475
Okay, cool.

25:09.560 --> 25:12.393
Yeah, it's mustard. Sorry does that
mean that it's unhealthy?

25:11.000 --> 25:12.228
INSTRUCTOR:
What do you think, Kevin?

25:13.240 --> 25:15.276
I think it would be a bit painful to
shit out pure mustard.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.834
(LAUGHING)

25:16.680 --> 25:18.272
That's Darren. That's Darren.

25:18.440 --> 25:19.998
It's just mustard for the purposes
of the exercise.

25:19.720 --> 25:20.789
What did you get?

25:21.880 --> 25:23.836
- We got peanut butter in ours.
- Peanut butter.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.592
Yeah, seriously spread that shit
on some toast.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.073

This is just representative...

25:26.720 --> 25:27.675
This is just representing...

25:28.840 --> 25:30.751
I've had shits like peanut
butter before.

25:30.520 --> 25:31.999
Can we settle, please,
so we can learn?

25:33.080 --> 25:35.230
- Can we settle so we can learn?
- DJ BEATS: Ah that's disgusting.

25:36.320 --> 25:39.198
And... there we go, it's official.

25:41.840 --> 25:46.960
Our records are now available
to purchase, exclusively online.

25:45.360 --> 25:48.670
Oh, mate! That's embarrassing.
I've now been officially

I'll probably move
to a nice part of Hounslow.

I'll probably get
a double Portakabin.

26:18.360 --> 26:19.588
So double-decker Portakabin.

26:21.560 --> 26:24.552
We're gonna have a castle in
Jamaica, slash clubhouse.

26:22.720 --> 26:23.675
It's one of my plans.

26:24.280 --> 26:25.633
You can come down
on holiday to Jamaica.

26:25.480 --> 26:26.469
Yeah, and I'll visit you boys
in Jamaica,

26:26.760 --> 26:27.829
I'll still be micro-managing them.

- From my office in Hounslow.

I tell you what, you've signed
this one, so it's a limited edition.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.439
We could actually probably
charge more for that.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.991
Love that.
Whack it on for a grand.

26:38.160 --> 26:39.388
Really? A grand?

26:40.600 --> 26:42.795
Two grand? Actually you're right.
I think any more than that

26:45.880 --> 26:50.032

- Nah, this is if it all goes well.
