WEBVTT

00:15.999 --> 00:17.999
What?

00:19.999 --> 00:23.250
No... tell me.

00:26.167 --> 00:27.776
I don't know.

00:27.876 --> 00:32.359
Just seems like whenever
I get close to you,

00:32.459 --> 00:37.442
you pull away from me.

00:37.542 --> 00:40.859
(<i>sighs</i>)

00:40.959 --> 00:44.109
Why do you do that?

00:44.209 --> 00:49.250
What are you
so afraid of telling me?

00:54.709 --> 00:56.292
Phoebe, don't.

01:01.125 --> 01:03.125
I want to know.

01:04.292 --> 01:07.000
I deserve to know.

01:09.292 --> 01:12.083
Phoebe, you don't know
what you're asking.

01:15.999 --> 01:17.442
(<i>sighs</i>)

01:17.542 --> 01:18.150
Whatever it is,

01:18.250 --> 01:21.899
you can't keep
running from it.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.692
And you can't
keep pretending

01:23.792 --> 01:25.899
that it's not
coming between us.

01:25.999 --> 01:30.584
You can't keep
hiding from the truth.

01:32.167 --> 01:33.209
(<i>roars</i>)

01:39.501 --> 01:43.626
That wasn't so
difficult, was it?

01:45.667 --> 01:46.776
What are you doing here?

01:46.876 --> 01:49.275
Reminding you
of your inner nature, Belthazor.

01:49.375 --> 01:51.899
One that would be
in your best interest

01:51.999 --> 01:54.899
to re-connect with... soon.

01:54.999 --> 01:56.983
I won't let you down.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.899
You already have.

01:58.999 --> 02:01.067
You vowed to destroy
the witches.

02:01.167 --> 02:04.150
Instead you bedded one of them?

02:04.250 --> 02:07.125
That was a mistake. I...

02:09.542 --> 02:13.484
Find demonic help if
you have to, Belthazor,

02:13.584 --> 02:16.609
but you better find a way
to kill the witches,

02:16.709 --> 02:18.501
or...

02:19.417 --> 02:21.417
...we'll kill you.

03:21.375 --> 03:26.899
(<i>indistinct conversations</i>)

03:26.999 --> 03:30.317
(<i>music playing</i>)

03:30.417 --> 03:30.899
All right, look.

03:30.999 --> 03:33.692
We know that Belthazor
is not going to stop

03:33.792 --> 03:34.899
until he kills us.

03:34.999 --> 03:35.899
Phoebe?

03:35.999 --> 03:37.275
Phoebe!

03:37.375 --> 03:37.818
Hi.

03:37.918 --> 03:38.651
I hate to interrupt

03:38.751 --> 03:39.651
your whole staring off

03:39.751 --> 03:41.776
into space
aimlessly thing

03:41.876 --> 03:42.899
that you got going
on right now,

03:42.999 --> 03:44.900
but in case you forgot,
evil Triad agent.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.899
Like you would ever
let me forget, Prue.

03:46.999 --> 03:48.942
Well, if he's as
powerful of a demon

03:49.042 --> 03:49.899
as Leo says he is,

03:49.999 --> 03:51.401
he's probably going to be
immune to our powers.

03:51.501 --> 03:53.484
That's why we need to practice
our counter attacks

03:53.584 --> 03:55.317
so the next time
he shows up,

03:55.417 --> 03:56.983
we can get some demon flesh.

03:57.083 --> 03:58.359
White meat or dark meat?

03:58.459 --> 04:00.983
Well, I don't like the idea
of demon fillet either,

04:01.083 --> 04:02.526
but it might help us with

04:02.626 --> 04:04.192
the vanquishing
potion.

04:04.292 --> 04:05.501
Hello?

04:05.918 --> 04:07.899
Phoebes!
Cole is 45 minutes late.

04:07.999 --> 04:09.567
You would think he
would be on time

04:09.667 --> 04:12.192
after he sleeps
with a girl, you know?

04:12.292 --> 04:13.275
PIPER:
Can we fast forward,

04:13.375 --> 04:14.287
because I got Fastball coming in

04:14.297 --> 04:16.442
in a couple of days
and I need to get

04:16.541 --> 04:18.709
some stuff done.
Cole!

04:19.625 --> 04:21.209
He's here. He's here.

04:21.959 --> 04:22.651
(<i>sotto</i>):
I'm sorry,

04:22.751 --> 04:24.025
but we have to stop
seeing each other, okay?

04:24.125 --> 04:26.734
Why? Because... because I
gotta kill you, that's why.

04:26.834 --> 04:27.120
Smooth.

04:27.130 --> 04:30.567
All right, we are
practicing the, uh...

04:30.667 --> 04:31.899
Sorry I'm late.

04:31.999 --> 04:32.818
It's okay.

04:32.918 --> 04:34.584
...the earthquake
drill...

04:34.999 --> 04:35.651
...tomorrow at 3:00.

04:35.751 --> 04:36.859
PIPER:
Sorry, Madam President,

04:36.959 --> 04:38.401
but I have a doctor's
appointment.

04:38.501 --> 04:40.942
PRUE:
Piper, you never know
when an earthquake

04:41.042 --> 04:42.067
is going to strike.

04:42.167 --> 04:42.899
I guess not.

04:42.999 --> 04:44.900
I guess I will
reschedule then.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.900
Phoebe, we need to, uh, talk?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.442
PRUE:
Uh, Phoebe,
earthquake drill

04:49.542 --> 04:50.484
tomorrow at 3:00.

04:50.584 --> 04:52.150
Okay, but if you need me
there by 3:00,

04:52.250 --> 04:53.037
you have to loan me your car

04:53.047 --> 04:54.234
'cause I have class
right afterwards.

04:54.334 --> 04:55.037
That's fine,
just try not

04:55.047 --> 04:56.609
to leave my gas tank
empty this time.

04:56.709 --> 04:57.609
I left
your gas tank

04:57.709 --> 04:58.899
empty once, okay?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.484
Get over it. Let it go.

05:00.584 --> 05:02.899
Twice.
I'm sorry, what
were you saying?

05:02.999 --> 05:04.899
Actually, if we could, uh...

05:04.999 --> 05:07.275
PRUE:
Oh, and, Phoebes,
I need the car back

05:07.375 --> 05:08.192
by 5:00 because I have

05:08.292 --> 05:09.567
a photo shoot
at P3 tomorrow.

05:09.667 --> 05:10.899
P3?

05:10.999 --> 05:11.651
Did you forget

05:11.751 --> 05:12.983
to inform the owner of P3?

05:13.083 --> 05:14.401
PRUE:
I'm sorry,
but my location

05:14.501 --> 05:15.899
fell out at the last moment

05:15.999 --> 05:16.734
and I couldn't
find you

05:16.834 --> 05:18.234
and I thought that
you would say yes.

05:18.334 --> 05:19.025
Of course you did.

05:19.125 --> 05:20.526
And did you forget about
the homeowners' meeting

05:20.626 --> 05:22.484
that's at our house
tomorrow afternoon?

05:22.584 --> 05:23.776
PRUE:
I totally spaced.

05:23.876 --> 05:25.192
Um, Phoebes,
will you cover for me?

05:25.292 --> 05:25.734
No way.

05:25.834 --> 05:27.899
On the last one it took
them two and a half hours

05:27.999 --> 05:29.109
to decide where to put
the garden gnomes.

05:29.209 --> 05:32.067
Um, all right,
do you want the car or not?

05:32.167 --> 05:32.900
I hate you.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.150
No you don't, you love me.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.899
I'd love to get
back to work.

05:35.999 --> 05:39.083
Okay, you two kids behave.

05:42.542 --> 05:43.275
Um...

05:43.375 --> 05:44.317
sorry about that.

05:44.417 --> 05:44.899
Sister stuff.

05:44.999 --> 05:47.999
You know, there's a fine line
between love and hate.

05:48.999 --> 05:50.526
So what did you want
to talk about?

05:50.626 --> 05:54.109
Um, actually I have to go.

05:54.209 --> 05:55.899
Wh...

05:55.999 --> 05:57.025
Wait. What?

05:57.125 --> 05:58.484
I'm sorry, Phoebe.

05:58.584 --> 05:59.234
It's just this...

05:59.334 --> 06:02.776
big case I've been working on,
I think I just

06:02.876 --> 06:06.959
had an epiphany
on how to win it.

06:09.584 --> 06:11.334
Forgive me.

06:12.999 --> 06:14.959
(<i>sighs</i>)

06:19.999 --> 06:25.834
Tell the Triad I've figured out
how to destroy the Charmed Ones.

06:37.167 --> 06:38.900
No, I'm planning
on getting to P3

06:39.000 --> 06:40.526
early to confer
with the stylist.

06:40.626 --> 06:42.818
All right, I'll see
you there. Bye.

06:42.918 --> 06:44.359
Hey, where's Phoebe?

06:44.459 --> 06:45.025
I'm here.

06:45.125 --> 06:46.899
Do you guys know if Cole called?

06:46.999 --> 06:48.609
Not since the last
time you asked.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.567
Okay, I need some
sisterly advice.

06:50.667 --> 06:53.234
Is he doing the whole
"blow her off after sex" thing

06:53.334 --> 06:54.899
and I'm just
not reading the signs?

06:54.999 --> 06:56.150
Probably not,
since the signs

06:56.250 --> 06:59.442
Prue read as an empath
prove that he loves you.

06:59.542 --> 07:01.818
Okay, well supernatural
guarantees aside,

07:01.918 --> 07:04.942
I am getting the feeling
that he is avoiding me.

07:05.042 --> 07:08.651
I mean, I have no
idea where we stand.

07:08.751 --> 07:10.109
Well, maybe it's got
something to do

07:10.209 --> 07:12.417
with whatever
he's hiding from you.

07:14.292 --> 07:15.501
Demon!

07:17.751 --> 07:18.859
(<i>grunting</i>)

07:18.959 --> 07:21.000
PRUE:
Piper, watch out.

07:22.334 --> 07:24.484
Uh, excuse me.

07:24.584 --> 07:25.918
(<i>grunts</i>)

07:27.417 --> 07:28.999
Piper, now!

07:30.292 --> 07:32.417
Ouch!

07:33.334 --> 07:35.209
You got skin!

07:37.999 --> 07:38.818
Hey, Leo,
do you think

07:38.918 --> 07:40.859
you could make yourself
look like Brad Pitt?

07:40.959 --> 07:42.734
PRUE:
All right, you guys,
that was, um, good,

07:42.834 --> 07:43.859
although, Phoebe,
I think you need

07:43.959 --> 07:45.983
more force on your kick,
and, Piper, a little less

07:46.083 --> 07:47.900
hesitating on the slicing
and dicing, okay?

07:48.000 --> 07:48.899
Should we try it again?

07:48.999 --> 07:52.150
No, I'd like to have
a boyfriend left

07:52.250 --> 07:53.359
when this is over.

07:53.459 --> 07:54.900
Okay, where are your keys, Prue?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.442
PRUE:
Hey, don't forget
to pick up food

07:57.542 --> 07:58.370
for the homeowners'
meeting.

07:58.380 --> 08:00.150
Okay, now how am I possibly
gonna pick up food

08:00.250 --> 08:02.109
when I have to get
your car back right away?

08:02.209 --> 08:05.417
Well, I can't do it.
I have to prep for my shoot.

08:06.292 --> 08:09.542
What? Don't look at me.

08:11.792 --> 08:16.609
I guess I'll reschedule my
doctor's appointment... again.

08:16.709 --> 08:18.834
You're cute.

08:24.792 --> 08:27.734
Have you ever
destroyed siblings?

08:27.834 --> 08:28.899
Sisters?

08:28.999 --> 08:30.275
MAN:
Sisters?

08:30.375 --> 08:33.899
I pit nations
against each other.

08:33.999 --> 08:37.417
I start wars, riots.

08:38.250 --> 08:40.317
I've reviewed
your resume, Andras.

08:40.417 --> 08:42.150
Rather unfocused
actually.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.401
My needs are
very particular.

08:44.501 --> 08:47.109
I can infect anybody.

08:47.209 --> 08:49.834
Anybody who's angry.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.983
That's your way in,
through anger?

08:53.083 --> 08:56.401
I see it
in my victims.

08:56.501 --> 08:57.526
It envelops them.

08:57.626 --> 09:01.234
Then I turn
that anger into rage,

09:01.334 --> 09:03.150
rage that
continues

09:03.250 --> 09:06.025
until they commit
an act of violence.

09:06.125 --> 09:09.692
Think you could work your magic
on the Charmed Ones?

09:09.792 --> 09:12.692
You said sisters, not witches!

09:12.792 --> 09:15.899
Ah, but they are sisters,
first and foremost,

09:15.999 --> 09:19.150
and that, I believe,
is their Achilles' heel.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.899
Break that bond
and we break

09:21.999 --> 09:23.776
the very foundation
of their powers.

09:23.876 --> 09:26.734
Without their powers,
they're defenseless.

09:26.834 --> 09:30.792
Which sister
shall we start with?

09:32.999 --> 09:34.899
The most vulnerable.

09:34.999 --> 09:38.526
The youngest.

09:38.626 --> 09:39.818
Class went late,
and then I had

09:39.918 --> 09:42.734
to go to the library to get
a book for Psyche class,

09:42.834 --> 09:45.192
so I'm running a little late,
but I will be there.

09:45.292 --> 09:48.484
Yeah, very funny.
"I was born late." Ha-ha.

09:48.584 --> 09:51.484
I promise I'll be there,
Okay?

09:51.584 --> 09:53.150
I'll be home s...

09:53.250 --> 09:54.109
soon.

09:54.209 --> 09:55.792
Gotta go. Bye.

09:56.709 --> 09:59.484
Uh... what are you doing here?

09:59.584 --> 10:01.067
I got a break in my case,

10:01.167 --> 10:03.899
decided to take
the afternoon off.

10:03.999 --> 10:04.359
Wow.

10:04.459 --> 10:07.818
That must have been quite an
epiphany you had last night.

10:07.918 --> 10:10.192
Yeah, it was.

10:10.292 --> 10:13.818
I came
to apologize, Phoebe,

10:13.918 --> 10:15.983
for walking out on you
so abruptly.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.776
That was rude.

10:17.876 --> 10:20.359
Yeah, it was rude.

10:20.459 --> 10:22.192
I'd love to make it up to you.

10:22.292 --> 10:23.942
I made
early dinner reservations

10:24.042 --> 10:25.150
as Risso's.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.818
Mm, I have
to get Prue's car back.

10:28.918 --> 10:31.234
I was hoping we could talk.

10:31.334 --> 10:32.234
About what?

10:32.334 --> 10:37.401
About the other night,
you and me, where we stand.

10:37.501 --> 10:40.692
Um... I would like to.

10:40.792 --> 10:43.899
I actually would
really like to,

10:43.999 --> 10:47.234
but I promised Prue
that I'd do...

10:47.334 --> 10:49.918
the homeowners'
meeting tonight, so...

10:52.999 --> 10:54.484
(<i>chuckles</i>)

10:54.584 --> 10:57.150
That's all right, I understand.

10:57.250 --> 11:00.667
It was worth a try.

11:04.292 --> 11:06.626
Uh...

11:08.999 --> 11:10.359
Cole,

11:10.459 --> 11:10.942
um...

11:11.042 --> 11:14.651
I could probably get Piper
to handle the meeting.

11:14.751 --> 11:16.983
Yeah?
You sure she won't be angry?

11:17.083 --> 11:17.942
Oh, she's gonna be furious,

11:18.042 --> 11:22.484
but she'll just suppress it
and take it out on me later.

11:22.584 --> 11:24.526
Um...

11:24.626 --> 11:26.734
you pick me up in an hour?

11:26.834 --> 11:28.999
I'll be there.

11:30.125 --> 11:32.459
(<i>both playfully growl</i>)

11:37.918 --> 11:40.417
(<i>engine starts</i>)

11:46.834 --> 11:48.918
(<i>honks</i>)

11:54.501 --> 11:56.317
...a restraining order.
Oh, yes, yes,

11:56.417 --> 11:58.899
I'll countersue and
my son is a lawyer.

11:58.999 --> 12:01.818
Your son is a fool probably.

12:01.918 --> 12:03.792
(<i>arguing continues</i>)

12:03.999 --> 12:04.899
Oh, watch the, uh...

12:04.999 --> 12:06.818
(<i>Piper screaming</i>)

12:06.918 --> 12:08.359
Oh! Prue!

12:08.459 --> 12:11.442
Welcome to Prue's world
of cluttered photography.

12:11.542 --> 12:14.234
I can't believe I
got roped into this.

12:14.334 --> 12:14.983
How did you get roped

12:15.083 --> 12:16.983
into heading
the refreshment committee?

12:17.083 --> 12:18.609
They didn't have time.

12:18.709 --> 12:19.192
And you do?

12:19.292 --> 12:20.359
Well, my doctor's
appointment

12:20.459 --> 12:22.899
doesn't count
as high priority.

12:22.999 --> 12:25.359
I mean, couldn't you make
something simpler?

12:25.459 --> 12:26.734
You know, chips and dip?

12:26.834 --> 12:27.859
Leo, I was a chef,

12:27.959 --> 12:29.025
I can't make chips and dip!

12:29.125 --> 12:31.484
Maybe you need to tell
your sisters how you feel.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.359
Or better yet,

12:32.459 --> 12:33.072
next time just say no.

12:33.172 --> 12:35.651
Okay, Leo, you obviously
do not have sisters.

12:35.751 --> 12:37.567
One minute you're
arguing about something,

12:37.667 --> 12:38.899
and then suddenly
you're arguing

12:38.999 --> 12:41.109
about who stole whose
Malibu Barbie in 1979.

12:41.209 --> 12:41.983
(<i>footsteps</i>)

12:42.083 --> 12:43.899
Hey, is Phoebe home yet?

12:43.999 --> 12:44.526
No!

12:44.626 --> 12:44.942
And...

12:45.042 --> 12:47.275
where-where is all
the mineral water?

12:47.375 --> 12:49.067
Uh, there's some
down in the basement.

12:49.167 --> 12:50.709
I'll get it.

12:56.250 --> 12:56.900
It's our property,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.609
it's our money,
and we are building a fence.

12:59.709 --> 13:00.526
Goat cheese pizza

13:00.626 --> 13:02.776
and onion tartlets
for the vegetarians.

13:02.876 --> 13:03.913
Thank you, dear.
Look, we want
our privacy,

13:03.923 --> 13:06.484
we've had enough
of your snooping.
(<i>woman gasps</i>)

13:06.584 --> 13:07.317
Thank you.
Snooping?!

13:07.417 --> 13:08.651
PIPER:
And the...
Snooping.

13:08.751 --> 13:09.734
The chicken sautÃ©

13:09.834 --> 13:10.899
has peanuts, in case

13:10.999 --> 13:12.899
anybody's allergic.
Oh, thank
you very much.

13:12.999 --> 13:15.167
Look, we have
talked to a...
Phoebe!

13:16.584 --> 13:18.275
Nice of you to show.

13:18.375 --> 13:19.692
Uh, Piper...

13:19.792 --> 13:21.275
Look, we have talked
to a lawyer.

13:21.375 --> 13:22.899
And according to the by-laws,

13:22.999 --> 13:24.067
we have the right to...

13:24.167 --> 13:24.899
I need a huge favor.

13:24.999 --> 13:26.150
Can I talk to you upstairs?

13:26.250 --> 13:27.999
Oh, no you don't.

13:28.751 --> 13:29.751
Phoebe!

13:30.667 --> 13:33.067
Phoebe, this is not fair.

13:33.167 --> 13:33.899
I know, it's not,

13:33.999 --> 13:35.567
but the last thing I expected

13:35.667 --> 13:37.067
was for Cole to ask me out,

13:37.167 --> 13:38.067
(<i>sighs</i>)
okay?

13:38.167 --> 13:39.401
So could you please
cover for me?

13:39.501 --> 13:42.899
I-I already rescheduled
my doctor's appointment twice.

13:42.999 --> 13:44.859
Well, Leo was a doctor

13:44.959 --> 13:45.899
before he died.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.776
That's really not the point.

13:47.876 --> 13:48.120
I know.

13:48.130 --> 13:50.025
And I would never ask,
but this is important.

13:50.125 --> 13:50.942
He wants to have "the talk."

13:51.042 --> 13:52.899
(<i>sighs</i>)
You know, are
we a couple,

13:52.999 --> 13:54.567
or are we a one-nighter?
Are we friends?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.484
Are we friends
that had a one-nighter?

13:56.584 --> 13:57.651
Okay, I get it.

13:57.751 --> 14:00.859
Ever planning on
unfreezing the neighbors?

14:00.959 --> 14:02.734
PHOEBE:
Piper, just this once?

14:02.834 --> 14:03.899
You know how much I want

14:03.999 --> 14:05.484
this relationship to work.

14:05.584 --> 14:06.150
(<i>sighs heavily</i>)

14:06.250 --> 14:09.417
Well, I guess I don't
have much of a choice.

14:10.751 --> 14:12.334
Oh!

14:13.999 --> 14:14.567
(<i>sighs</i>)

14:14.667 --> 14:15.651
You are so helping me

14:15.751 --> 14:16.329
run this meeting.

14:16.339 --> 14:18.317
(<i>twinkling</i>)
They're calling.

14:18.417 --> 14:20.899
Oh, no, no, no.
No, Leo! Oh!

14:20.999 --> 14:22.567
(<i>sighs</i>)

14:22.667 --> 14:24.734
You chicken!

(<i>sighs</i>)

14:25.709 --> 14:28.083
(<i>overlapping shouts</i>)

14:44.125 --> 14:45.899
Andras?

14:45.999 --> 14:46.651
If Phoebe's right,

14:46.751 --> 14:48.899
Piper will be primed
and ready for you.

14:48.999 --> 14:50.983
I thought we were
starting with Phoebe.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.067
We did.

14:52.167 --> 14:54.067
I did.

14:54.167 --> 14:55.899
She's the reason Piper's angry,

14:55.999 --> 14:58.025
and she'll be the reason
Prue gets angry.

14:58.125 --> 15:02.317
You just make sure you're there
to capitalize on that.

15:02.417 --> 15:03.899
Don't you need me to enrage

15:03.999 --> 15:07.192
all three of the sisters
for your plan to work?

15:07.292 --> 15:10.692
You infect Piper and Prue,

15:10.792 --> 15:13.192
I'll bring Phoebe back home.

15:13.292 --> 15:15.899
They'll blame her
for everything.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.234
Your legend is
well deserved, Belthazor.

15:19.334 --> 15:20.609
(<i>scoffs</i>)

15:20.709 --> 15:21.442

about to score
one of the biggest victories

15:25.042 --> 15:26.859
in centuries...

15:26.959 --> 15:29.692
you don't seem
very happy about it.

15:29.792 --> 15:33.209
Just do your job.

15:35.417 --> 15:37.584
(<i>car door beeping</i>)

15:41.918 --> 15:44.567
Your fence will block
the sun from my flowers!

15:44.667 --> 15:45.317
Well, then I suggest

15:45.417 --> 15:46.899
you take it up
with the sun!

15:46.999 --> 15:47.776
Oh, great. Great idea.

15:47.876 --> 15:51.734
Okay, uh, why don't you
build a shorter fence?

15:51.834 --> 15:52.150
Or move

15:52.250 --> 15:53.899
your flower bed?
No, it is not

15:53.999 --> 15:55.317
my azaleas that are

15:55.417 --> 15:56.859
the problem here.

15:58.751 --> 15:59.818
We will see you in court.

15:59.918 --> 16:03.317
Okay, everybody,
please try to calm down!

16:03.417 --> 16:04.442
Phoebe.

16:04.542 --> 16:05.484
Phoebe.

16:05.584 --> 16:06.776
Those are my earrings.

Hey!

All right, everybody shut up!

I have had it with your

petty problems
and your stupid fence

16:20.999 --> 16:21.899
and your stupid flower bed!

16:21.999 --> 16:22.859
There are bigger problems

16:22.959 --> 16:24.899
in the world to worry about.

16:24.999 --> 16:27.025
Just get a life and grow up!

16:27.125 --> 16:29.900

You can't speak
to us like that!

With pleasure!
Go on!

We should build a fence

to keep you in!

16:40.709 --> 16:41.037
Good idea!

16:41.047 --> 16:43.651
I'll speak to your sister
about the way you behaved!

Better idea!

wore a penguin costume.

No!

Yes!

17:21.751 --> 17:23.608
I was 15, leave me alone.

Bet you were cute.

And I had to
do this walk.

(<i>laughs</i>)
Oh, no, don't.

17:30.167 --> 17:31.734
I did the walk.

Yeah, I think I have.

I'm still living
with my two sisters,

17:54.375 --> 17:56.442
and still going
to college, you know.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.317

like to work past that.

Um, it's more

18:03.876 --> 18:06.584
out of necessity.

18:07.999 --> 18:08.776
But it...

18:08.876 --> 18:10.734
You know,
enough about me.

18:10.834 --> 18:12.275
Tell me about you.

Oh.

I'm sorry.

18:33.292 --> 18:35.692
I know how that feels.

18:35.792 --> 18:38.442
Um, I never knew my mother.

18:38.542 --> 18:41.776
And my father left
when I was really little.

18:41.876 --> 18:44.734
So we were raised
by my grandmother.

18:44.834 --> 18:47.484
And she's not with us any more.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.609
But you still have your sisters.

18:49.709 --> 18:50.359
Yeah.

And I thank God for them
every day.

I don't know what I-I would do

Are you okay?

I have to tell you.

Okay, look, if we're
not gonna talk about us...
No.

gonna talk about you,

No, I didn't forget.

I loaned my car to
someone, and obviously...

20:08.334 --> 20:11.275
they obviously forgot
to fill the tank.

Keep it down,

All right.

21:01.250 --> 21:02.417
(<i>Piper gasps</i>)

21:13.999 --> 21:15.609
I had a great time tonight.

21:15.709 --> 21:19.067
Better than being at
the homeowners' meeting?

21:19.167 --> 21:22.067
Mm, a little.

21:22.167 --> 21:24.025
Okay, you're married.

21:24.125 --> 21:24.818
What?

21:24.918 --> 21:26.899
That's the big secret,
you're married.

21:26.999 --> 21:28.442
You have three kids,
and two dogs,

21:28.542 --> 21:29.899
and a really cute cat, right?

21:29.999 --> 21:31.734
And I'm the seven-year itch?

21:31.834 --> 21:33.109
You found me out.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.109
(<i>chuckles</i>)

21:34.209 --> 21:36.484
Can't get anything past me.

21:36.584 --> 21:39.899
No, I guess not.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.751
Um...

21:43.209 --> 21:46.083
about the other night.

21:47.667 --> 21:51.942
Are you sorry that we, uh...

21:52.042 --> 21:54.899
Not at all.

21:54.999 --> 21:56.501
Are you?

21:56.999 --> 21:58.859
Depends on what happens next.

21:58.959 --> 22:02.818
Too bad you can't
predict the future.

22:02.918 --> 22:04.999
Who says I can't?

22:06.751 --> 22:09.999
(<i>chuckles</i>)

22:21.959 --> 22:23.834
Mmm.

22:24.999 --> 22:26.734
Are you sure
you don't want to come in?

22:26.834 --> 22:30.417
Better get back to

Right.

Phoebe.

22:42.292 --> 22:44.334
Yeah.

22:46.083 --> 22:47.899

Shut up!

23:29.626 --> 23:30.692
You know what?
I am so sorry

23:30.792 --> 23:32.983
I didn't check with you
about your stupid little club,

23:33.083 --> 23:34.899
but I was too busy
being the only witch

23:34.999 --> 23:35.899
concerned about
the Triad!

23:35.999 --> 23:36.900
Oh, right. Without the mighty

23:37.000 --> 23:38.567
Prue Halliwell,
we'd all be dead!

23:38.667 --> 23:39.692
Get over yourself, Prue!

23:39.792 --> 23:40.287
PHOEBE:
Sisters,

23:40.297 --> 23:41.899
what has gotten into you two?
By the way,

23:41.999 --> 23:43.899
you owe me for a car tow
and a tank

23:43.999 --> 23:44.899
of gas, you
little leech!

23:44.999 --> 23:46.734
I'm sorry. Is it
Gang Up On Phoebe Day,

23:46.834 --> 23:47.526
and nobody told me?

23:47.626 --> 23:48.942

23:49.999 --> 23:50.899

Yeah, so
while you get

23:53.083 --> 23:54.899
we are stuck picking up your

23:54.999 --> 23:55.900

23:56.000 --> 23:58.651
What's the matter Prue, jealous?

23:58.751 --> 23:59.275
All work and no

23:59.375 --> 24:01.484

even more boring?

24:01.584 --> 24:04.234
Oh, yeah, there's a lot
to be jealous of, Phoebe.

24:04.334 --> 24:06.025
What, jealous
that I'm still in school,

24:06.125 --> 24:07.567
jealous
that I'm still unemployed,

24:07.667 --> 24:09.275
and jealous that
I am still living

24:09.375 --> 24:10.192
off of my sisters?!

24:10.292 --> 24:11.692
PIPER:
Yeah, Grams said
you'd never

24:11.792 --> 24:12.899

Hmm.

I am so sick of the fact

24:14.083 --> 24:15.109
that I-I have
been saddled with

24:15.209 --> 24:17.275
the two of you my entire life!

24:17.375 --> 24:18.651
Whatever. I'm leaving.

24:18.751 --> 24:19.692
Oh, sure.
You're such

24:19.792 --> 24:20.899
an immature
brat, you leave

24:20.999 --> 24:22.317
every time you can't
hack something!

24:22.417 --> 24:24.734
Well, there's nothing
keeping me here now, is there?

24:24.834 --> 24:25.859
PRUE:
Oh, well, I
see that you

24:25.959 --> 24:27.567
inherited Dad's talent
for bailing!

24:27.667 --> 24:29.734
That's because
the two of us couldn't deal

24:29.834 --> 24:30.692
with living with the two of you!

24:30.792 --> 24:33.651
Well, at least I'm not so stupid
I had to do college twice.

24:33.751 --> 24:36.359
Well, at least
I actually had the courage

24:36.459 --> 24:37.734
to go away to college.

24:37.834 --> 24:38.859
What's the matter, Piper?

24:38.959 --> 24:39.859
The real world too much for you?

24:39.959 --> 24:43.942
I am so sick of the two of you
ganging up on me and judging me!

24:44.042 --> 24:46.275
I am so sick
of saving your asses!

24:46.375 --> 24:49.899
I'm sick of being taken
for granted, and those are mine!

25:46.334 --> 25:47.651
You tell me.

25:47.751 --> 25:50.899
Uh, well, we had a little...

25:50.999 --> 25:51.442
Tiff.

25:51.542 --> 25:53.109
Must have been more
than a little,

25:53.209 --> 25:54.275
because They felt it.

25:54.375 --> 25:55.192

"They felt it?"

Uh...

26:09.125 --> 26:10.359

What happened

26:10.459 --> 26:11.109
to our powers?

26:11.209 --> 26:12.899
That's what we have
to figure out.

26:12.999 --> 26:14.359
Let's start
with your little tiff.

26:14.459 --> 26:17.401
Well, that's a bit
of an understatement.

26:17.501 --> 26:19.234
It was big.

26:19.334 --> 26:20.899
How big?
PRUE:
Um,

26:20.999 --> 26:23.942
do you remember Pearl Harbor?

26:24.042 --> 26:24.692
(<i>sighs</i>)

26:24.792 --> 26:25.899
Look, okay,
so what triggered it?

26:25.999 --> 26:28.442
Uh, I don't know,
just little things, I guess.

26:28.542 --> 26:31.359
I really didn't want
to do this stupid meeting and...

26:31.459 --> 26:32.734
PRUE:
My car ran
out of gas,

26:32.834 --> 26:35.109
and because of that,
I missed my job.

26:35.209 --> 26:35.734
That's it?

26:35.834 --> 26:37.651
Yeah. I mean... it's weird.

26:37.751 --> 26:39.899
We were angry,
but we shouldn't have been

26:39.999 --> 26:41.899
<i>that</i> angry.
It was almost

26:41.999 --> 26:42.899
like something...

26:42.999 --> 26:45.442
Something sort of
came over us.

26:45.542 --> 26:47.359
Yeah, like something
like Belthazor.

26:47.459 --> 26:49.859
Oh, it doesn't track,
because no matter what he does,

26:49.959 --> 26:52.067
he doesn't have the power
to take away yours.

26:52.167 --> 26:53.567
So back to
your argument.

26:53.667 --> 26:56.567
You yelled, and you...
threw stuff?

26:56.667 --> 26:58.899
Well, we did a little bit more
than that.

26:58.999 --> 27:01.692
We used our powers.

27:01.792 --> 27:03.899
On each other?

27:03.999 --> 27:05.275
All right,
well then,

27:05.375 --> 27:06.651
that's what
happened.

27:06.751 --> 27:09.776
Your powers are rooted
in your bond as sisters.

27:09.876 --> 27:10.899
Using them
against each other

27:10.999 --> 27:12.275
must have
severed that bond.

27:12.375 --> 27:14.067
All right, you-you-you need
to repair the damage

27:14.167 --> 27:16.899
to your relationship fast,
because without your powers,

27:16.999 --> 27:17.899
you are extremely vulnerable.

27:17.999 --> 27:19.734
So, you need to
get Phoebe...

27:19.834 --> 27:20.776
Phoebe's gone.

We don't even have
basic powers anymore.

29:30.292 --> 29:31.287
I cannot believe
this is happening.

29:31.297 --> 29:34.734
What I don't understand is,
how could Belthazor make us

29:34.834 --> 29:35.526
that angry?

29:35.626 --> 29:36.609
That's not his power.

29:36.709 --> 29:38.192
LEO:
No, it's not, but it is

29:38.292 --> 29:39.542
his.

he doesn't just create
it out of thin air.

I was just so angry.

31:45.918 --> 31:47.876
(<i>sniffles</i>)

31:49.584 --> 31:54.417
And thank you for
being there for me.

32:05.751 --> 32:07.667
(<i>Phoebe sighs</i>)

32:26.501 --> 32:28.999
(<i>whispers</i>):
I can't.

32:30.876 --> 32:32.983
I can't.

32:33.083 --> 32:35.234
What do you mean?

32:35.334 --> 32:37.818
(<i>sighs</i>)

32:37.918 --> 32:39.899
Oh, Phoebe...

32:39.999 --> 32:42.067
you need to go home...

32:42.167 --> 32:43.776
now.

32:43.876 --> 32:46.899
What?

32:46.999 --> 32:48.109
Why?

32:48.209 --> 32:51.401
Because you're...

32:51.501 --> 32:53.900
vulnerable right now.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.375
I don't...

32:57.334 --> 32:59.959
We shouldn't do this.

33:00.292 --> 33:04.417
(<i>inhales and exhales
loudly</i>)

33:05.459 --> 33:08.859
(<i>whispers</i>):
You need to go home.

33:08.959 --> 33:11.484
You need to go

33:11.584 --> 33:14.459
and figure out what happened.

33:19.999 --> 33:22.526
You're right.

33:22.626 --> 33:25.125
Yes, I do.

33:43.083 --> 33:45.459
Thank you.

33:54.999 --> 33:57.542
You're welcome.

34:03.999 --> 34:05.900
So, the rumors are true!

34:06.000 --> 34:07.899
You've fallen for a witch!

34:07.999 --> 34:09.899
What are you doing here?
Get out!

34:09.998 --> 34:11.899
The great Belthazor!

34:11.998 --> 34:13.525
Who would have
ever thought?

34:13.626 --> 34:14.609
I can hardly
wait to see

34:14.708 --> 34:16.150
what the Triad
will do when I

34:16.250 --> 34:17.567
tell them you failed!

34:17.667 --> 34:21.109
I'll kill you
before you ever get the chance!

34:21.208 --> 34:21.899
Yeah?

34:21.998 --> 34:26.042
Then you really are
a traitor, aren't you?

34:29.998 --> 34:31.983
Pissed off, are you?

34:32.083 --> 34:32.775
Good.

34:32.876 --> 34:36.208
Because there's something
you don't know about me.

34:36.501 --> 34:39.417
I can possess
my victims, too.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.998
(<i>roaring</i>)

34:48.998 --> 34:50.958
(<i>sighs</i>)

34:51.667 --> 34:53.998
(<i>sighs</i>)

34:58.542 --> 35:00.999
(<i>panting</i>)

35:03.751 --> 35:05.899
ANDRAS' VOICE:
Now, let's go finish

35:05.999 --> 35:08.692
what we started, shall we?

35:08.792 --> 35:11.900
(<i>chuckles</i>)

35:12.000 --> 35:13.709
Yeah.

35:15.000 --> 35:15.983
Well, if you hear from her,

35:16.083 --> 35:17.899
just tell her
to call home, okay?

35:17.999 --> 35:20.818
It's an emergency.
Thanks.

35:20.918 --> 35:21.692
So, she's not at the club,

35:21.792 --> 35:23.526
and none of her friends
have seen her.

35:23.626 --> 35:24.983
Did you try Cole?
No answer.

35:25.083 --> 35:27.776
If something happens to her,
I'll never forgive myself.

35:27.876 --> 35:29.401
Nothing is going to happen.

35:29.501 --> 35:31.025
Leo, something happened
to Grams,

35:31.125 --> 35:32.317
something happened to Mom.

35:32.417 --> 35:33.899
It kind of runs in the family.

35:33.999 --> 35:36.999
(<i>door opens and shuts</i>)

35:37.999 --> 35:38.983
Phoebe, thank God.

35:39.083 --> 35:41.899
Has the tribal
council spoken?

35:41.999 --> 35:44.692
Am I booted
off the island?

35:44.792 --> 35:47.234
Are you okay?
Yeah.

35:47.334 --> 35:48.275
Where were you?

35:48.375 --> 35:50.484
I was at Cole's.

35:50.584 --> 35:52.900
And after a lot
of talking and
a lot of tears,

35:53.000 --> 35:54.818
he convinced me to come home

35:54.918 --> 35:56.317
and deal with
what happened.

35:56.417 --> 35:58.192
Belthazor is what happened.

35:58.292 --> 35:58.899
What?

35:58.999 --> 35:59.899
PIPER:
Abbreviated version--

35:59.999 --> 36:02.776
he used some underling spirit
to enrage us,

36:02.876 --> 36:05.067
and when we fought,
we lost our powers.

36:05.167 --> 36:08.776
No more Triquetra,
no more power of three.

36:08.876 --> 36:09.692
We have no powers?

36:09.792 --> 36:11.899
But that means that...

36:11.999 --> 36:14.317
That he's going
to try and come kill us.

36:14.417 --> 36:16.025
Which when
you didn't come home,

36:16.125 --> 36:18.899
we thought
that he had already...

36:18.999 --> 36:21.584
No, it's okay; I'm fine.

36:22.999 --> 36:23.900
So, what do we do?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.899
A spell, a vanquish, a potion?

36:25.999 --> 36:26.776
LEO:
You need to try

36:26.876 --> 36:28.667
and restore your
bond as sisters.

36:30.751 --> 36:33.751
I'll, uh, give you some privacy.

36:35.999 --> 36:36.899
Hmm.

36:36.999 --> 36:39.234
A potion would be easier, huh?

36:39.334 --> 36:40.999
Oh, yeah.

36:42.999 --> 36:43.899
PIPER:
Um...

36:43.999 --> 36:48.484
Phoebe, Grams didn't say
you'd never amount to anything.

36:48.584 --> 36:50.899
That was just me being mean.

36:50.999 --> 36:52.484
She was...

36:52.584 --> 36:54.442
is very proud of you.

36:54.542 --> 36:55.942
Well, we all know that sometimes

36:56.042 --> 36:59.651
I'm not the most responsible
person in the world.

36:59.751 --> 37:00.859
PRUE:
No, Phoebe,

37:00.959 --> 37:03.192
that's all kind of ancient
history isn't it?

37:03.292 --> 37:04.859
I mean,
you've grown up a lot,

37:04.959 --> 37:06.567
and I'm sorry
if I don't treat you

37:06.667 --> 37:08.150
like you have all the time.

37:08.250 --> 37:09.484
It's okay.

37:09.584 --> 37:10.692
And since Mom died...

37:10.792 --> 37:12.150
PIPER:
You did take care of us,

37:12.250 --> 37:14.983
and you do still look out
for us all the time,

37:15.083 --> 37:16.692
and we don't

37:16.792 --> 37:17.983
always say thank you.

37:18.083 --> 37:20.899
Sometimes
we take you for granted.

37:20.999 --> 37:22.025
I don't think I'm the one

37:22.125 --> 37:25.667
who's been taken for granted
around here.

37:28.751 --> 37:29.067
You know,

37:29.167 --> 37:31.899
who needs Oprah
when we can do it ourselves?

37:31.999 --> 37:35.083
(<i>chuckling softly</i>)

37:35.918 --> 37:38.417
Do you think
we have our powers back?

37:40.999 --> 37:42.899
(<i>gasps</i>)

37:42.999 --> 37:44.899
PRUE:
All right, no.
You try.

37:44.999 --> 37:46.692
Oh, mine aren't working either.

37:46.792 --> 37:48.626
We worked on
our issues!

37:49.501 --> 37:51.317
(<i>grunting</i>)

37:51.417 --> 37:52.234
Leo!
No, wait.

37:52.334 --> 37:53.859
You guys run,
I'll hold him off.

37:53.959 --> 37:57.626
No Prue, we're
in this together,
no matter what.

37:59.999 --> 38:01.542
Look, the Book!

38:05.876 --> 38:07.442
(<i>growling</i>)

38:07.542 --> 38:10.484
(<i>grunting and groaning</i>)

38:10.584 --> 38:11.818
Okay, that's new.

38:11.918 --> 38:14.150
Demon with
demon filling.

38:14.250 --> 38:18.999
Nobody crosses me!

38:19.459 --> 38:22.899
(<i>screaming</i>)

38:22.999 --> 38:24.292
Uh-oh.

38:25.125 --> 38:26.999
PRUE:
Okay, positions.

38:32.959 --> 38:34.150
PRUE:
Uh, Piper...

38:34.250 --> 38:35.999
Whoa.

38:39.626 --> 38:40.999
Piper, the knife!

38:42.501 --> 38:43.999
(<i>yelling</i>)

38:45.751 --> 38:47.292
Oh! Ah!

38:55.459 --> 38:57.484
(<i>groaning</i>)

38:57.584 --> 38:58.999
(<i>moaning</i>)

39:00.417 --> 39:03.876
(<i>grunting</i>)

39:06.375 --> 39:08.959
(<i>groans</i>) Okay.

39:13.375 --> 39:14.234
He's gone.

39:14.334 --> 39:15.401
At least for now.

39:15.501 --> 39:16.999
PIPER:
Ow.

39:17.709 --> 39:18.150
Are you okay?

39:18.250 --> 39:19.983
Yeah. Good thing
I'm already dead.

39:20.083 --> 39:21.192
Did you get him?

39:21.292 --> 39:22.692
Oh, yeah.

39:22.792 --> 39:23.567
Ugh!

39:23.667 --> 39:25.567
Uh... I got a slice.

39:25.667 --> 39:26.899
PRUE:
Mmm. Yum,

39:26.999 --> 39:28.734
the other white meat.

39:28.834 --> 39:29.818
Better him than me.

39:29.918 --> 39:31.150
PHOEBE:
Well, at least now

39:31.250 --> 39:33.025
we could work on a
vanquishing spell.

39:33.125 --> 39:37.042
Well, we better hurry
before Belthazor's encore.

39:42.375 --> 39:46.526
âª Eyes that rise
to meet me halfway âª

39:46.626 --> 39:49.109
âª Up among the stars âª

39:49.209 --> 39:51.067
âª You may be from Venus âª

39:51.167 --> 39:52.899
âª But I'm definitely
not from Mars âª

39:52.999 --> 39:56.109
âª You're an ocean,
you're an ocean âª

39:56.209 --> 40:00.567
âª Settle down, settle down,
what's the commotion? âª

40:00.667 --> 40:02.067
âª I'm an island âª

40:02.167 --> 40:03.899
âª But you're an ocean âª

40:03.999 --> 40:07.192
âª It's a stormy sea
of love and emotion âª

40:07.292 --> 40:13.250
âª You've got me suspended
motionless in time... âª

40:20.751 --> 40:22.359
Hey, how did the
photo session go?

40:22.459 --> 40:24.234
Not as good as if
it had been done here,

40:24.334 --> 40:26.275
but definitely better
for our relationship.

40:26.375 --> 40:28.275
Well, the next time,
just give me some warning,

40:28.375 --> 40:30.234
and I'll be happy
to accommodate you.

40:30.334 --> 40:31.900
Oh, I promise.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.442
By the way, how was
your doctor's appointment?

40:34.542 --> 40:34.995
It was fine.

40:35.005 --> 40:36.859
Everything was normal
except my stress level.

40:36.959 --> 40:38.484
PHOEBE:
Oh, I don't mean
to stress you out

40:38.584 --> 40:40.651
even more, but I ran into
Ellen and Claire,

40:40.751 --> 40:44.025
and they said they
worked everything
out with Mrs. Snyder.

40:44.125 --> 40:45.899
What did you say
to them, anyway?

40:45.999 --> 40:47.109
Oh, uh, nothing.

40:47.209 --> 40:48.818
I just spoke my mind.

40:48.918 --> 40:51.859
Maybe you should handle
all the meetings.

40:51.959 --> 40:53.150
No. Absolutely not.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.109
Wow, you're getting good
at saying no.

40:55.209 --> 40:56.234
(<i>laughing</i>)

40:56.334 --> 40:57.859
Thank you.

40:57.959 --> 40:58.776
Anyway, I think it's good

40:58.876 --> 41:01.709
that we got everything
out on the table.

41:01.959 --> 41:03.484
And for the sake
of innocents everywhere,

41:03.584 --> 41:06.484
I think that we should always
just tell each other

41:06.584 --> 41:07.776
how we feel.

41:07.876 --> 41:08.899
Well, not always.

41:08.999 --> 41:11.192
We might kill
each other.

41:11.292 --> 41:12.234
(<i>laughing</i>)

41:12.334 --> 41:13.899
Okay, then most of the time.

41:13.999 --> 41:18.234
Just enough to keep demons away
from splitting us up.

41:18.334 --> 41:20.959
I agree with that.

41:25.626 --> 41:28.692
Haven't heard
from Cole yet, huh?

41:28.792 --> 41:29.734
No.

41:29.834 --> 41:32.983
I still can't figure
that guy out.

41:33.083 --> 41:35.667
But I will.

41:41.667 --> 41:43.859
TRIAD MEMBER 1:
I warned you, Belthazor.

41:43.959 --> 41:47.401
I warned you what would
happen if you failed us.

41:47.501 --> 41:50.776
He's done more than fail us.

41:50.876 --> 41:52.692
He's betrayed us.

41:52.792 --> 41:56.109
You've betrayed
the Source.

41:56.209 --> 41:58.401
You showed sympathy
to the witches.

41:58.501 --> 42:03.876
And squandered
a golden opportunity.

42:07.167 --> 42:10.999
You are allowed
one final statement.

42:15.999 --> 42:19.899
I've got nothing to say.

42:19.999 --> 42:22.209
Except...
Ah!

42:25.459 --> 42:27.999
(<i>screaming</i>)

42:30.999 --> 42:34.542
(<i>yelling</i>)

42:39.000 --> 42:41.876
(<i>yelling continues</i>)
