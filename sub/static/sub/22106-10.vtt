Well, not technically
nuclear, but... Yeah.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.627
If we use that one, we die too.

16:02.628 --> 16:06.331
The bottom piece destroys
the Ancestor from within.

16:06.332 --> 16:09.300
Can we just whack it with
a hammer and call it good?

16:09.301 --> 16:11.936
The Ancestor
is near indestructable.

16:11.937 --> 16:13.672
These weapons were designed
to do what others can't.

16:14.173 --> 16:15.273
If we have this weapon,

16:15.274 --> 16:18.243
then why did you need Silas' crystal?

16:20.913 --> 16:24.349
The inside of the Ancestor
is like a giant maze.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.117
And we need someone familiar
with the landscape

16:26.118 --> 16:29.620
to create a space for the weapon
and guide us to it.

16:29.621 --> 16:33.091
Only a Skin Rider can do that.

16:33.092 --> 16:35.193
You go inside the Ancestor?

16:35.194 --> 16:37.195
Our brain states do.

16:37.196 --> 16:38.963
That's what the middle piece does.

16:38.964 --> 16:41.432
And Silas helps you?

16:41.433 --> 16:45.970
A portion of Silas is in this crystal.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.205
We attach it to the middle piece,

16:47.206 --> 16:48.673
it filters out the parasite,

16:48.674 --> 16:51.343
but maintains the data
about the Ancestor.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.280
How do we trigger this thing?

16:56.281 --> 16:57.382
We don't know.

16:57.383 --> 17:00.151
Yellow doesn't know either.

17:03.789 --> 17:07.290
I don't mean to be blunt,
but this is suicide.

17:07.291 --> 17:10.228
There are too many unknowns,
too many pieces.

17:10.229 --> 17:12.630
You only half-understand
this weapon.

17:12.631 --> 17:15.266
Your only contigency will kill you.

17:15.267 --> 17:17.101
You have little awareness
of your adversary or

17:17.102 --> 17:18.136
of the terrain.

17:18.137 --> 17:22.272
You have a sharp stick as a weapon.

17:22.273 --> 17:23.340
Look, I applaud your courage,

17:23.342 --> 17:25.309
but if you do this,

17:25.310 --> 17:26.310
you are going to lose.

17:26.310 --> 17:27.512
Gee, Ezra.

17:27.512 --> 17:28.480
Why don't you tell us
how you really feel?

17:28.481 --> 17:30.748
If we don't do this, we lose.

17:30.749 --> 17:33.117
How are we going to grow crops,

17:33.118 --> 17:35.520
raise children if we have to
lock ourselves in here?

17:35.521 --> 17:36.654
We'll starve.

17:36.655 --> 17:37.589
This is why they sent us.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.024
I DON'T CARE why they sent us.

17:40.025 --> 17:42.360
We are the human race, not them.

17:42.361 --> 17:44.762
We decide how we grow, how we live.

17:44.763 --> 17:45.797
Not them.

17:45.798 --> 17:48.800
We want the same thing, Ezra.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.534
That doesn't mean anything.

Abram and Feena said they
would move into another room

I cannot find Kylie
anywhere in the facility.

28:43.288 --> 28:44.988
What if she didn't even come this way?

28:44.989 --> 28:47.324
What if she went north
to be with the other settlers?

28:47.325 --> 28:49.159
They've been more family
to her than we have.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.461
She would never find them.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.595
Not easily.

28:51.596 --> 28:53.197
She knows that.

28:53.198 --> 28:55.199
She was angry we weren't taking action,

28:55.200 --> 28:57.267
so this is her taking action.

28:57.268 --> 28:59.837
Just keep your cool when we find her.

28:59.838 --> 29:01.238
My cool?

29:01.239 --> 29:03.874
She's grounded for
the rest of her life!

29:03.875 --> 29:06.043
We're not on the best terms
with her yet.

29:06.044 --> 29:08.212
Just keep that in mind.

29:08.213 --> 29:09.780
We're her parents, Lynn.

29:09.781 --> 29:11.448
Our job is to be her parents.

29:11.449 --> 29:12.817
That doesn't mean being angry.

29:23.795 --> 29:25.996

safe to have a fire?

29:25.997 --> 29:28.499
Either that or we freeze to death.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.300
Relax.

29:29.301 --> 29:30.934

29:30.935 --> 29:32.269
Nobody is going to find us--

29:37.742 --> 29:38.809
What's with the fire?

29:38.810 --> 29:41.178
Do you want Skin Riders to kill you?

29:41.179 --> 29:42.412
Told you.

29:42.413 --> 29:44.148
Hey, it took me an hour to build that.

29:44.149 --> 29:45.482
And if you die because of it,

29:45.483 --> 29:47.317
you will have wasted
a lot more than an hour.

29:47.318 --> 29:49.153
I'm guessing your parents
don't know you're here.

29:49.154 --> 29:50.187

29:50.188 --> 29:52.289

29:54.826 --> 29:56.660
I know this world better than you do.

29:56.661 --> 29:58.662
I've trained more,
I've survived longer.

29:58.663 --> 30:01.165
I have a way better chance
of doing this than you do.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.666
She has her father's tact.

30:02.667 --> 30:05.035
I understand that you're angry, Kylie,

30:05.036 --> 30:06.370

30:06.371 --> 30:08.972
Out of respect for your parent,
we can't let you come with us.

30:10.275 --> 30:11.808
So respect for my parents
is a greater priority

30:11.809 --> 30:15.279
than the safety and survival
of the human race?

30:15.280 --> 30:17.181
She makes her point.

30:17.182 --> 30:18.182
It's not that simple, Kylie.

30:18.183 --> 30:20.350
Actually, yes, it is.

30:20.351 --> 30:22.019
If this fails, we all fail.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.321
And my parents might not want
to accept that as a fact,

30:24.322 --> 30:25.489
but it's a fact.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.391
Your chances improve with me helping.

30:27.392 --> 30:28.559
Feisty.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.893
I'll give her that.

30:29.894 --> 30:31.461
If you want to stay warm,
we should keep moving.

30:31.462 --> 30:33.031

30:33.298 --> 30:34.798
Well, then.

46:03.260 --> 46:04.827
I find that hard to believe.

46:04.828 --> 46:08.798
Oh, that wasn't me.

46:08.799 --> 46:12.335
I suspect the girl in the
forest buried you.

46:12.336 --> 46:16.639
She was quite fond of your family.

46:16.640 --> 46:19.342
Or Silas.

46:19.343 --> 46:21.110
There's no telling with him.

46:24.181 --> 46:32.181
And now, Ezra, I will kill you again.

46:32.322 --> 46:34.190
Stupid pride.

46:34.191 --> 46:37.193
You could have killed me
when I first came in here.

46:37.194 --> 46:39.595
But you couldn't miss
the chance to gloat.

46:39.596 --> 46:42.598
To prove how much stronger
you are than humans.

46:42.599 --> 46:44.934
Who are you trying to convince, Jax?

46:44.935 --> 46:45.968
Me?

46:45.969 --> 46:49.372
Or yourself?

47:15.799 --> 47:16.500
GO!

48:02.879 --> 48:03.981
Neat, huh?

Still out there.

48:11.488 --> 48:14.156
You're supposed to guide me
to the bottom piece.

48:14.157 --> 48:14.725
The weapon.

Only Skin Riders can create space

48:27.437 --> 48:29.338
within the Ancestor from memories.

48:29.339 --> 48:32.174
That's why you needed me.

Only I could have brought this here.

Don't you see?

No, I don't see.

The cabin, Ezra.

48:40.784 --> 48:42.285
It's a Trojan horse.

48:42.286 --> 48:44.353
I bring it from my memory

48:44.354 --> 48:48.190
