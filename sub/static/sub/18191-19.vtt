Narrator:
PREVIOUSLY ON "CHASING LIFE"...

00:02.202 --> 00:05.573
ARE YOU GUYS, A: DATING,
OR B: JUST OTHER STUFF?

00:07.641 --> 00:09.042
B.

00:09.076 --> 00:10.778
I REALIZED THAT MY PERIOD
WAS TWO WEEKS LATE.

00:11.010 --> 00:13.214
I TOLD JAKE
AND HE WROTE ME A CHECK

00:13.246 --> 00:14.714
SO I COULD TAKE CARE OF IT.

00:14.749 --> 00:18.452
BETH KINGSTON,
WILL YOU MOVE IN WITH ME?

00:18.486 --> 00:19.754
I WANT TO TAKE A YEAR OFF
TO TRAVEL.

00:19.786 --> 00:21.655
O...KAY.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.158
Natalie:
I KIND OF MADE OUT
WITH YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.359
- UM, DOMINIC?
- IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

00:26.393 --> 00:29.129
YOU'VE GOT, LIKE,
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.632
I NEVER FELT THIS WAY
ABOUT ANYONE.

00:35.101 --> 00:37.804
Man singing:

- IT'S A VULNERABLE ORGAN.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.819
IT BREAKS EASILY.

00:52.051 --> 00:55.555
SOME PEOPLE ARE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

00:55.588 --> 00:57.258
WHEN IT'S FULL.

00:57.290 --> 01:00.161
AND THEN
THERE'S EVERYBODY ELSE.

01:00.194 --> 01:03.597
I HAPPEN TO BE
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.400
I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN LOVE BEFORE.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.403
April:
THAT IS SO ROMANTIC.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.272
( chuckles )
YEAH.

01:12.305 --> 01:14.141
WE HAD DINNER
AND THERE WAS CANDLES,

01:14.174 --> 01:17.811
AND THEN GRAHAM ASKED ME
TO MOVE IN WITH HIM.

01:17.844 --> 01:20.313
WOW.

01:20.347 --> 01:24.185
RIGHT?
( sighs )

01:24.218 --> 01:27.153
BUT, BETH,
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DATING,
LIKE, BARELY SIX MONTHS.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.489
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE FAST?

01:29.522 --> 01:31.325
NOT REALLY, NO.

01:31.358 --> 01:34.594
I CARE ABOUT GRAHAM
MORE THAN ANY GUY I'VE DATED

01:34.628 --> 01:36.329
IN A REALLY LONG TIME.

01:36.362 --> 01:39.165
AND HE'S RIGHT.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.201
WE WON'T SEE EACH OTHER
IF WE DON'T MOVE IN TOGETHER.

01:41.234 --> 01:44.405
AND I KIND OF LIKE THE IDEA
OF WAKING UP WITH HIM
EVERY MORNING.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.105
THAT'S GOOD.

01:46.140 --> 01:49.109
IT'S JUST I REMEMBER
DOMINIC TALKING

01:49.143 --> 01:52.212
ABOUT HOW CHALLENGING
IT COULD BE

01:52.246 --> 01:56.115
TO LIVE WITH GRAHAM
SOMETIMES, AND...

01:56.150 --> 01:58.618
BUT IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S RIGHT,
THEN I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.353
THANKS.

02:00.387 --> 02:03.224
- I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS TOO.
- MM-HMM.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.426
LEO AND I ARE GIVING IT
ANOTHER CHANCE.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.295
WOW.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.265
YOU DON'T LIKE HIM,
DO YOU?

02:12.299 --> 02:14.268
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.471
JUST I'M-- I'M SKEPTICAL.

02:17.504 --> 02:20.139
I WOULDN'T MIND
SEEING SOMETHING TO CONVINCE ME

02:20.174 --> 02:22.543
THAT THIS GUY IS GOOD ENOUGH
FOR MY BEST FRIEND.

02:22.575 --> 02:26.146
WELL, HERE'S AN IDEA.

02:26.180 --> 02:29.250
WHY DON'T WE DO
A DINNER PARTY

02:29.283 --> 02:31.384
WITH OUR BOYFRIENDS?
LIKE A DOUBLE DATE?

02:31.418 --> 02:33.721
THIS WAY I CAN
GET TO KNOW GRAHAM

02:33.753 --> 02:36.389
AS MORE THAN DOMINIC'S ROOMMATE
WHO COMPLAINS ALL THE TIME,

02:36.423 --> 02:39.492
AND YOU CAN GET TO KNOW LEO
AS MORE THAN THE GUY

02:39.526 --> 02:41.295
THAT MESSES WITH MY HEAD.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.764
BUT, WAIT,
DO WE HAVE TO COOK?

02:43.796 --> 02:45.399
PLEASE.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.433
YET ANOTHER REASON
WHY I LOVE YOU TO DEATH.

02:47.468 --> 02:50.204
- UH...
- OH, WAIT, NOT DEATH.

02:50.236 --> 02:53.740
I DIDN'T MEAN DEATH.
NO DEATH. NO DEATH, SORRY.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.909
- AWKWARD.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.200
I WANT TO TAKE A YEAR
TO TRAVEL,

03:21.235 --> 03:22.870
BUT SHE KEEPS DROPPING
THE MOST OBVIOUS HINTS

03:22.902 --> 03:26.372
ABOUT APPLYING TO COLLEGES,
"JUST IN CASE."

03:26.407 --> 03:29.842
LIKE THAT'S HER WAY
OF BEING SUPPORTIVE.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.246
WHAT DID YOUR PARENTS DO
WHEN YOU SAID

03:32.278 --> 03:34.381
- THAT YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO COLLEGE?
- THEY WERE FINE WITH IT.

03:34.414 --> 03:35.415
THEY'RE INTO
"WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY."

03:35.449 --> 03:36.984
GOD, I AM SO JEALOUS.

03:37.216 --> 03:38.852
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE
JUST SHOWING OFF.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.320
( all laughing )

03:40.353 --> 03:41.722
SO YOU SEEM GOOD.

03:41.754 --> 03:43.389
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU, BUT--

03:43.424 --> 03:45.391
BUT LAST TIME YOU DID,
I WAS CRAZY.

03:45.425 --> 03:48.461
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
- ACTUALLY, YOU DID.

03:48.495 --> 03:50.930
YOU, LIKE, LITERALLY SAID
I WAS CRAZY.

03:50.965 --> 03:52.832
RIGHT, THAT.

03:52.865 --> 03:54.668
UH, SORRY SORRY.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.736
I MEAN, IT'S FINE.
YOU WEREN'T WRONG.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.906
UH, BUT I'M BACK
ON MY MEDS NOW.

03:58.938 --> 04:01.975
- AND YOU FEEL OKAY?
- YEAH, I FEEL FINE.

04:02.008 --> 04:03.843
I MEAN, I ONLY STOPPED
TAKING THEM

04:03.877 --> 04:05.245
TO PISS OFF MY PARENTS.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.247
AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.449
SO I'M SORRY TO SAY, BREN,

04:09.483 --> 04:10.818
BUT IN THE SUCKY PARENTS
DEPARTMENT,

04:10.850 --> 04:12.485
I'M ALWAYS GONNA WIN.

04:15.823 --> 04:18.292
( Leo and April giggling )

04:18.324 --> 04:20.761
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ALMOST
STOPPED DOING THIS.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.997
- LET'S NEVER STOP DOING THIS.
- OKAY.

04:23.029 --> 04:26.600
WAIT WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TOMORROW NIGHT?

04:26.634 --> 04:29.702
- NO STOPPING.
- SERIOUSLY.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.372
BETH AND I WANT
TO HAVE A DINNER PARTY
WITH YOU AND GRAHAM.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.673
IT'LL BE FUN.

04:33.706 --> 04:36.476
YEAH, WHAT WOULDN'T BE
MORE FUN THAN HAVING DINNER

04:36.509 --> 04:37.778
WITH YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND'S
ROOMMATE?

04:37.810 --> 04:40.413
- GRAHAM WILL BEHAVE.
- YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT BETH?

04:40.447 --> 04:41.749
I BET SHE HATES ME.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.018
WHAT? NO.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.653
I KNOW YOU TELL HER EVERYTHING.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.521
NOT EVERYTHING.

04:48.555 --> 04:52.492
SHE JUST DOESN'T
REALLY KNOW YOU... YET.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.726
( sighs )

04:55.963 --> 04:57.665
OKAY.

04:57.697 --> 04:59.566
BUT, LOOK,
IF THEY GANG UP ON ME,

04:59.600 --> 05:02.935
I CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE
FOR MY ACTIONS.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.771
MMM. AH!

05:04.805 --> 05:08.574
OH, IS IT TIME
FOR A LITTLE SHOW?

05:08.608 --> 05:09.976
NO, IT'S TIME TO GET READY

05:10.009 --> 05:11.377
FOR YOGA AT SUPPORT GROUP.

05:11.411 --> 05:15.581
OH, YEAH,
UM, ABOUT THAT...

05:15.615 --> 05:17.384
YOU LOVE YOGA NIGHT.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.886
YEAH, BUT I'VE--

05:18.918 --> 05:20.319
I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT IT,

05:20.353 --> 05:24.524
AND I-- I THINK I'M DONE
WITH SUPPORT GROUP.

05:24.557 --> 05:26.627
WHAT? WHY?

05:26.660 --> 05:29.562
WELL, I MEAN,
GIVEN THE PAST MONTH,

05:29.596 --> 05:32.432
I THINK I NEED A LITTLE LESS
CANCER IN MY LIFE.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.600
IT'S BEEN ALL CANCER
ALL THE TIME.

05:34.634 --> 05:37.603
I JUST FEEL LIKE
I NEED TO DISTANCE MYSELF

05:37.637 --> 05:39.338
SO I CAN--
I CAN MOVE ON, YOU KNOW?

05:39.372 --> 05:41.108
FOCUS ON RIGHT NOW.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.776
OKAY.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.446
GUESS I'LL JUST
HAVE TO FIND

05:45.478 --> 05:46.713
SOMEONE ELSE
TO HELP ME STRETCH.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.560
( whispering )
WHO ARE WE HIDING FROM?

06:00.593 --> 06:02.362
( sighs )

06:02.396 --> 06:04.464
NO ONE. I JUST THOUGHT I SAW

06:04.497 --> 06:06.432
ONE OF MY CLIENTS
WHO'S KIND OF CLINGY

06:06.466 --> 06:08.468
AND I DIDN'T WANT IT
TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE IF I WAS,

06:08.502 --> 06:10.670
- YOU KNOW...
- ( laughs )

06:10.704 --> 06:12.538
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE LIAR,

06:12.572 --> 06:15.576
WHICH IS SURPRISING,
SINCE YOU SPEND ALL DAY

06:15.608 --> 06:19.980
PRETENDING TO BE INTERESTED
IN PEOPLE'S BORING STORIES.

06:20.012 --> 06:22.449
THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS BORING.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.584
( clears throat )

06:23.617 --> 06:26.552
SO WHY ARE YOU SNEAKING AROUND?

06:26.586 --> 06:29.589
IS IT BECAUSE YOU ATTACKED ME
IN YOUR OFFICE

06:29.622 --> 06:31.625
AND NOW YOU'RE HAVING REGRETS?

06:31.658 --> 06:33.860
'CAUSE PERSONALLY,
I THOUGHT IT WAS HOT.

06:33.894 --> 06:37.497
I'M NOT SAYING IT WASN'T.
YOU KNOW--

06:37.531 --> 06:39.066
- HOT.
- RIGHT.

06:39.098 --> 06:43.971
IT'S JUST THAT, I--
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR
ANYTHING SERIOUS RIGHT NOW,

06:44.004 --> 06:47.507
IN TERMS OF THE SEX.

06:47.540 --> 06:50.476
AND, I MEAN, IT WAS NICE.

06:50.511 --> 06:54.581
NICE? NOT NICE.
IT WAS ENJOYABLE.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.483
- OH.
- IT WAS DEFINITELY ENJOYABLE

06:56.516 --> 06:59.485
- AND NICE.
- YEAH.

06:59.519 --> 07:02.689
- PLEASE SAY SOMETHING.
- JUST SO YOU KNOW,

07:02.723 --> 07:04.824
I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR SERIOUS EITHER.

07:04.858 --> 07:08.661
LAST TIME WAS EASY.
LET'S JUST KEEP IT THAT WAY.

07:08.694 --> 07:13.132
IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I'VE HAD EASY.
EASY SOUNDS PERFECT.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.737
WELL, WANT TO HAVE IT
AGAIN SOON?

07:21.440 --> 07:23.843
SURE.
WHY NOT?

07:23.877 --> 07:26.512
YEAH.
TOMORROW NIGHT?

07:26.547 --> 07:28.682
TOMORROW NIGHT.

07:28.714 --> 07:30.550
MMM.

07:32.019 --> 07:35.088
WERE YOU ACTUALLY
ON YOUR WAY OUT?
'CAUSE YOU CAN GO NOW.

07:35.122 --> 07:38.658
YES, I WAS.
( laughs )

07:40.060 --> 07:41.595
( door opens )

07:43.863 --> 07:46.567
( music playing )

07:52.038 --> 07:53.973
( laughs )
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

07:54.007 --> 07:56.742
MAYBE I'M BIASED,
BUT IT CAN'T BE THE FOOD.

07:56.776 --> 07:59.512
NO, IT'S A WORK THING.
I'M MEETING JONATHAN RICHMAN'S
MANAGER AT 7:00

07:59.545 --> 08:01.081
FOR THIS REVIEW THAT I'M DOING.

08:01.113 --> 08:03.983
- IT'S ONLY 6:30.
- I KNOW.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.588
IT WAS GREAT RUNNING INTO YOU
AT THE BOOKSTORE.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.822
YOU KNOW, I CHECKED OUT
YOUR BOOK AFTER YOU LEFT.

08:09.856 --> 08:12.625
- AND?
- I STILL DON'T GET THE HELMETS.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.696
WELL, CREATING FICTIONAL
PERSONAS IN REAL LIFE.

08:15.728 --> 08:16.997
IT'S LIKE-- IT'S CONCEPTUAL.

08:17.029 --> 08:18.764
IT'S PRETENTIOUS.

08:18.798 --> 08:22.735
I TAKE IT YOU'RE INTO MUSIC
THAT'S A LITTLE MORE--

08:22.769 --> 08:26.005
AWESOME?
YEAH, I'M KIND OF
A KATY AND KESHA GIRL.

08:26.038 --> 08:28.040
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I ONLY EVER
LISTEN TO PARTY MUSIC.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.810
I LIKE SOME CLASSIC STUFF.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.245
YEAH? LIKE WHAT?

08:31.278 --> 08:35.048
WELL, MY DAD
USED TO BRING ME RECORDS
WHENEVER HE VISITED.

08:35.081 --> 08:39.653
- SPRINGSTEEN, THE STONES,
THE HOLLIES.
- MM-HMM.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.990
I USED TO BE OBSESSED
WITH THAT SONG, "THE AIR
THAT I BREATHE."

08:43.023 --> 08:44.658
LOVE THAT SONG.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.559
IT'S SO GOOD, RIGHT?

08:46.592 --> 08:48.629
YEAH, THOSE RECORDS WERE,
LIKE, THE ONLY WAY

08:48.662 --> 08:51.298
I FELT CONNECTED TO HIM
WHEN HE WASN'T AROUND.

08:51.530 --> 08:54.567
I GUESS
THAT'S KIND OF A BUMMER, BUT--

08:54.600 --> 08:56.669
NO, GIVES THE MUSIC
A LOT OF POWER.

08:56.702 --> 09:00.606
ALL MY FAVORITE ALBUMS,
THERE'S SOME KIND
OF STORY THERE.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.808
YOU PROBABLY THINK
THAT SOUNDS PRETENTIOUS.

09:02.842 --> 09:05.544
THAT'S WHY YOU DO
WHAT YOU LOVE.

09:08.615 --> 09:11.652
APRIL.

09:11.684 --> 09:14.120
- HEY, GUYS.
- LOOK WHO I RAN INTO.

09:14.153 --> 09:15.688
I'M HERE FOR WORK.

09:15.721 --> 09:18.759
COOL. I WAS JUST GOING
TO GET A TEA TO GO.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.326
OH, I GOT YA.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.265
EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH YOUR HEALTH?

09:26.299 --> 09:29.235
- BRENNA SAID
THERE WAS A SCARE?
- YEAH, I-- I'M OKAY.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.038
THANKS FOR ASKING.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.975
THANK YOU.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.611
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
DON'T WORK TOO HARD.

09:38.644 --> 09:39.980
NO CHANCE OF THAT.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.114
SEE YA.

09:42.581 --> 09:44.017
SO THAT WAS WEIRD.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.953
I DON'T KNOW WHY I PANICKED.
I JUST FELT LIKE WE WERE--

09:46.986 --> 09:49.255
WE WERE DOING SOMETHING WRONG?
I KNOW.

09:49.288 --> 09:50.990
BUT WE'RE NOT.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.725
WE'RE ALLOWED TO BE FRIENDS,
RIGHT?

09:52.759 --> 09:54.594
I MEAN,
APRIL'S WITH SOMEONE ANYWAY,

09:54.628 --> 09:56.697
WHICH DOESN'T MATTER,
SINCE WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING
ABOUT DATING.

09:56.730 --> 10:00.200
RIGHT. I MEAN,
WE ONLY MADE OUT THAT ONE TIME,

10:00.232 --> 10:01.934
BEFORE WE KNEW EACH OTHER.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.705
HARDLY COUNTS.

10:04.738 --> 10:09.710
SO LET'S JUST KEEP BEING FRIENDS
AND NOT WORRY ABOUT IT, OKAY?

10:09.743 --> 10:11.845
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF WE'RE FRIENDS,

10:11.878 --> 10:13.647
I SHOULD HAVE YOUR NUMBER,
RIGHT?

10:18.818 --> 10:21.654
OKAY.

10:21.687 --> 10:22.788
BACK TO WORK.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.826
NICE SEEING YOU, FRIEND.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.102
SO I HEARD THERE MIGHT BE
TROUBLE IN PARADISE.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.705
YOU MEAN BETWEEN LEO AND ME?

10:38.739 --> 10:41.341
I'M AFRAID YOUR SOURCE
IS INACCURATE.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.710
OH.
SO WHERE IS HE?

10:43.744 --> 10:48.414
UM, HE DECIDED
THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO COME
TO SUPPORT GROUP ANYMORE.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.384
HE KIND OF WANTS
TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM CANCER
NOW THAT HE'S HEALTHY.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.019
OH.

10:53.052 --> 10:54.821
WHY, WHAT'S UP?

10:54.855 --> 10:57.691
WELL, I'M HELPING
WITH THIS FUNDRAISER
FOR PRIVATE PARTS CANCER.

10:57.724 --> 11:00.927
YOU KNOW, TESTICLE, BREAST,
OVARIAN, CERVICAL.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.763
- HOW PHILANTHROPIC.
- YEAH.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.998
WELL, IT'S THIS WEEK
AND THERE'S STILL
A TON TO DO.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.832
WELL, I CAN VOLUNTEER.

11:06.866 --> 11:09.035
AND I BET A LOT OF MY FRIENDS
WOULD WANT TO HELP TOO.

11:09.068 --> 11:11.437
I KNOW I STILL OWE YOU
AFTER THAT AMY SNOW SITUATION.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.306
WELL, THAT'D BE GREAT.
THANKS.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.043
BUT WHAT WE REALLY NEED
IS AN M.C.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.378
I WAS GOING TO ASK LEO
BECAUSE HE'S KIND OF
A BIG DEAL.

11:18.412 --> 11:21.947
I HEARD HE WAS SORT OF
A ONE-MAN MAKE-A-WISH FOUNDATION
BEFORE HIS SURGERY,

11:21.981 --> 11:24.051
AND HE WAS ON TV A LOT
FOR HIS DAD'S CAMPAIGN.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.052
- YOU SOUND LIKE A FAN.
- WELL, YEAH.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.855
AND WE HAVE THE SAME TASTE
IN WOMEN.

11:28.889 --> 11:32.292
SO HOW CAN I GET HIM TO HOST?

11:32.325 --> 11:34.326
DO YOU THINK IF YOU ASKED HIM,
HE'D DO IT?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.830
YEAH, I'LL GET HIM TO DO IT.

11:36.863 --> 11:37.963
AWESOME.

11:40.966 --> 11:44.136
( thunder rumbling )

11:44.171 --> 11:47.340
( vibrating )

11:56.750 --> 11:59.219
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

11:59.251 --> 12:00.720
ARE YOU OKAY?

12:06.025 --> 12:08.461
I TRIED TO TALK TO MY PARENTS.

12:08.495 --> 12:11.498
I TOLD THEM I DIDN'T LIKE
HOW MUCH TIME THEY WERE SPENDING
AWAY FROM HOME,

12:11.730 --> 12:13.432
AND MY MOM--
SHE DIDN'T EVEN LET ME FINISH.

12:13.466 --> 12:17.403
SHE JUST STARTED YELLING AT ME
ABOUT HOW I DON'T UNDERSTAND
RESPECT.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.840
I'M SO SORRY.

12:19.873 --> 12:23.243
COULD I STAY HERE TONIGHT?

12:23.275 --> 12:25.879
UM...

12:29.448 --> 12:33.019
YEAH.
JUST BE REALLY QUIET, OKAY?

12:38.758 --> 12:40.793
I FEEL LIKE I DO EVERYTHING
THAT SHE WANTS,

12:40.826 --> 12:42.361
AND IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

12:42.394 --> 12:44.865
LIKE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT SHE WANTS ANYMORE.

12:44.898 --> 12:48.000
I MEAN, COME ON,
HOW ARE YOU NOT ENOUGH?

12:48.033 --> 12:51.538
YOU'RE THE BEST DAUGHTER
SHE COULD POSSIBLY HOPE FOR.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.508
SHE DOESN'T THINK SO.

12:54.540 --> 12:57.309
WELL, SHE'S WRONG.

13:09.422 --> 13:12.826
( music playing )

13:15.528 --> 13:18.431
- Graham: HERE'S ONE.
- AH, NO.

13:18.465 --> 13:21.801
I'M NOT LIVING THERE.
I WORK LATE, AND THAT T STOP
IS SKETCHY.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.836
MMM.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.542
WHY ARE YOU, LIKE,
THINKING ABOUT WHETHER
THAT'S LEGIT?

13:28.575 --> 13:30.177
IT'S LEGIT.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.544
WELL, WHAT IF I
JUST WALKED YOU HOME
FROM THE T EVERY NIGHT?

13:31.577 --> 13:33.547
THEN I'D END UP
DEFENDING BOTH OF US.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.581
LET'S JUST BE HONEST
WITH OURSELVES.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.585
AND YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY,
BUT SAFETY MAKES A LOT
MORE SENSE AS A DEAL-BREAKER

13:38.817 --> 13:40.287
THAN NOT HAVING AN ELEVATOR.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.190
UH, A.K.A., TREMENDOUS
POWER SUCK AND OIL SUCK,

13:43.222 --> 13:44.890
TWO LIMITED RESOURCES
IN OUR WORLD.

13:44.924 --> 13:47.159
IT IS SO LIKE YOU
TO HAVE A LIST OF THINGS

13:47.193 --> 13:49.296
THAT YOU DON'T WANT
IN AN APARTMENT.

13:49.328 --> 13:53.299
YOU DON'T WANT AN ELEVATOR,
YOU DON'T WANT A COFFEE SHOP
WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.402
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE
LIVE NEAR A COFFEE SHOP, RIGHT?

13:55.434 --> 13:57.370
WE'RE GOING TO END UP
SPENDING FIVE BUCKS A DAY

13:57.403 --> 13:59.239
ON LATTES THAT WE COULD
JUST MAKE OURSELVES.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.509
OKAY OKAY, SO NO ELEVATOR,
NO COFFEE SHOP NEARBY.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.312
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
THAT YOU JUST CAN'T TOLERATE?

14:05.345 --> 14:08.148
YEAH, YOUR MATTRESS.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.149
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY MATTRESS?

14:10.182 --> 14:13.419
NOTHING.
JUST MINE'S WAY BETTER.

14:13.452 --> 14:16.255
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- ( sighs )

14:16.288 --> 14:19.192
GUESS I HAVE TO SHOW YOU NOW.

14:19.225 --> 14:21.995
COME ON.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.630
HEY, YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY
GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT YOU
ON THIS WHOLE MATTRESS THING.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.500
OH, YEAH, WE'RE GOING
TO BATTLE IT OUT FOR AT LEAST
20 MINUTES.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.501
GO GO GO GO!

14:29.536 --> 14:31.538
20 MINUTES.
START NOW, GO!

14:34.274 --> 14:37.576
- HI.
- Woman: HI.

14:37.610 --> 14:41.581
I'M-- I'M DR. CARVER.
ARE YOU MY 3:00?

14:41.615 --> 14:43.883
ACTUALLY, NO.
I'M HERE TO SEE OWEN.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.552
OH, SORRY.
I JUST ASSUMED BECAUSE
YOU SEEM TO BE FROM HERE--

14:46.586 --> 14:49.188
I AM.
VIVIAN GORDON.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.590
I'M OWEN'S WIFE.

14:50.624 --> 14:53.525
I WANTED TO SEE HIS NEW OFFICE
SO I THOUGHT I'D SURPRISE HIM,

14:53.559 --> 14:55.629
BUT HE MUST BE
TAKING A LONG LUNCH.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.498
WOULD YOU MIND LETTING HIM KNOW
I STOPPED BY?

15:03.168 --> 15:05.471
( knocking )
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

15:05.504 --> 15:07.907
I COULD BARELY READ THIS,
BY THE WAY.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.476
YEAH, WELL, MY HANDWRITING
SUCKS WHEN I'M ANGRY.

15:10.509 --> 15:14.614
- WELL, WHY ARE YOU--
- I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING
YOUR LOVELY WIFE EARLIER.

15:14.648 --> 15:17.116
PLEASE TELL ME
THAT WAS FOR A GREEN CARD.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.053
WERE YOU EVER GOING
TO MENTION THAT YOU'RE MARRIED?

15:23.556 --> 15:25.591
VERY SORRY.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.596
IT'S COMPLICATED.
WE JUST--

15:30.629 --> 15:32.999
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO, IT'S NOT.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.000
AS SOMEONE WHO'S
BEEN CHEATED ON BEFORE,

15:35.034 --> 15:38.004
IT'S NOT COMPLICATED.
YOU DON'T CHEAT.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.673
SIMPLE RULE OF RESPECTING
ANOTHER PERSON.

15:40.706 --> 15:43.076
OR IN THIS CASE, TWO PEOPLE--
HER AND ME.

15:43.109 --> 15:46.346
I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU'D
BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE.

15:46.379 --> 15:47.980
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

15:48.014 --> 15:50.149
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FIND OUT

15:50.182 --> 15:53.552
THAT YOU'VE BEEN
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF FOR YEARS
BY SOMEONE YOU LOVE,

15:53.586 --> 15:56.523
OR TO MEET THE OTHER WOMAN
IN YOUR OWN HOME, OR--

15:56.556 --> 15:59.591
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:59.625 --> 16:01.727
YOU DON'T DESERVE
TO KNOW ANY OF THIS.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.962
SARA, WAIT.

16:03.996 --> 16:07.267
JUST LEAVE.

16:19.511 --> 16:21.480
MMM,
THIS CHICKEN'S AMAZING.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.482
THANKS.
BETH HELPED.

16:23.515 --> 16:26.452
BY HOLDING THE TAKE-OUT BAG
WHILE YOU PAID FOR IT?

16:26.485 --> 16:28.554
YEAH, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

16:32.024 --> 16:35.294
UM, LOOK, I THINK
I SHOULD CLEAR THE AIR HERE.

16:35.327 --> 16:39.065
UH, IF YOU'RE PICKING UP
ON AN UNDERLYING HOSTILITY,
I APOLOGIZE.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.668
IT'S JUST DOM'S MY BOY.
YOU STOLE HIS GIRL.

16:41.701 --> 16:45.205
BUT HE'S MOVED ON,
SO I'M GOING TO TRY
TO DO THE SAME, OKAY?

16:45.238 --> 16:48.006
UM, THANK YOU.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.676
YEAH, PUT IT RIGHT THERE.
OW.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.080
SO HOW IS
THE APARTMENT SEARCH GOING?

16:54.114 --> 16:56.048
- GREAT.
- NOT GREAT.

16:56.081 --> 16:57.783
OH, YOU GUYS
ARE MOVING IN TOGETHER?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.385
WELL, CONGRATS.

16:59.418 --> 17:00.787
THANKS.

17:01.019 --> 17:02.621
HAVE YOU EVER LIVED
WITH ANYONE BEFORE?

17:02.654 --> 17:05.325
UM, ROMANTICALLY? NO.

17:05.357 --> 17:08.595
I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD
ANY LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS
TO SPEAK OF.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.663
UM, IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO PLAN A FUTURE WITH SOMEONE

17:10.696 --> 17:12.664
WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE A FUTURE.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.233
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.300
THAT MAKES SENSE.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.635
YOU THINK THAT'S ALL IT WAS,
THOUGH?

17:16.669 --> 17:20.073
DID YOU MAYBE HAVE A FEAR
OF COMMITMENT? OW.

17:21.673 --> 17:23.710
MAYBE WE BOTH DO.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.546
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER LIVED
WITH A BOYFRIEND EITHER.

17:26.578 --> 17:29.249
I DON'T THINK
THAT NECESSARILY MEANS
HE HAS A FEAR OF COMMITMENT.

17:29.281 --> 17:33.586
IN FACT, LEO COMMITS
A LOT OF HIS LIFE TO INSPIRING
OTHER CANCER PATIENTS.

17:33.619 --> 17:36.155
SEE? I'M A GOOD PERSON.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.691
OH, AND LEO, I RAN INTO JULIAN
LAST NIGHT AT SUPPORT GROUP.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.792
APPARENTLY,
YOU'VE INSPIRED HIM TOO.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.694
HE IS ORGANIZING
THIS CANCER FUNDRAISER

17:42.729 --> 17:44.798
AND HE WANTS YOU TO HOST.
I THINK THAT JUST MEANS,

17:44.830 --> 17:46.633
LIKE, SHOWING UP,
MAYBE MAKING A SPEECH.

17:46.665 --> 17:50.769
UH, YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE BEEN SUCH A MESS LATELY.

17:50.804 --> 17:53.539
I DON'T THINK
I'M THE BEST PERSON
FOR THAT KIND OF THING.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.142
I'VE SEEN YOU SPEAK IN PUBLIC
FOR YOUR DAD BEFORE.
YOU'RE AMAZING.

17:56.175 --> 17:59.179
WELL, YEAH, BUT I ALWAYS HAD
A SPEECHWRITER FOR THOSE THINGS.

17:59.211 --> 18:01.513
I DON'T-- WE ALREADY TALKED
ABOUT THIS, REMEMBER?

18:01.548 --> 18:04.116
UM, I KIND OF ALREADY TOLD HIM
THAT YOU'D DO IT.

18:04.150 --> 18:08.086
I'M SORRY.
I'LL TELL HIM THAT I CAN'T.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.355
THAT'S OKAY, I'LL TELL HIM.

18:10.390 --> 18:13.593
I COULD SPEAK.
YOU KNOW, I LIKE SPEAKING.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.296
YEAH, WE'RE WELL AWARE
OF THAT.

18:16.328 --> 18:18.565
( phone ringing )

18:18.597 --> 18:20.165
YELLO?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.768
HEY, IT'S DOMINIC.
YOU WORKING?

18:21.800 --> 18:24.269
YEAH, BUT I CAN TALK
FOR A FEW.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.839
SO I RODE BY THE SIDEWALK SALE
THIS MORNING.

18:26.873 --> 18:31.611
AND I AM NOW THE PROUD OWNER
OF A HOLLIES ALBUM FROM 1974,

18:31.644 --> 18:33.378
THE ONE THAT HAS
"THE AIR THAT I BREATHE" ON IT.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.280
NO WAY.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.749
WELL, ACTUALLY,
YOU'RE THE PROUD OWNER,
IF YOU WANT IT.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.585
YOU GOT IT FOR ME?

18:38.617 --> 18:40.487
It was just
a couple of bucks.

18:40.519 --> 18:42.855
WELL, THANKS.

18:42.888 --> 18:44.490
I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT.

18:44.523 --> 18:46.759
SO ANY BIG PLANS TONIGHT?

18:46.792 --> 18:49.162
UH, I WAS JUST
GOING TO HEAD HOME.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.263
YOU KIND OF LIVE
OVER BY DOWNTOWN, RIGHT?

18:51.297 --> 18:53.398
UH, YEAH, NEAR WHERE YOU WORK,
I THINK.

18:53.432 --> 18:56.802
Yeah, I'm actually there now.
Probably gonna be here late.

18:56.836 --> 19:00.640
WANT TO JUST SWING BY
AND GRAB THE RECORD?

19:00.673 --> 19:02.642
IS ANYONE THERE?

19:02.674 --> 19:04.877
LIKE APRIL?

19:04.911 --> 19:06.679
NO, IT'S JUST ME.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.681
NOT THAT IT WOULD MATTER
IF THERE WERE.

19:08.714 --> 19:11.317
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.355
UM...

19:15.387 --> 19:17.490
Brenna:
SO REMEMBER WHAT I SAID?

19:17.523 --> 19:19.491
LET ME GO TALK TO HER
AND DON'T COME OUT HERE

19:19.526 --> 19:21.361
UNTIL I TELL YOU TO, OKAY?

19:23.296 --> 19:26.699
HEY, MOM.
CAN WE TALK FOR A SECOND?

19:26.732 --> 19:30.435
HONEY, I JUST NEED 15 MINUTES
TO DECOMPRESS AND GRAB
A GLASS OF WINE.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.838
- MOM, JUST--
- PLEASE, BRENNA, JUST--

19:36.843 --> 19:38.845
( sighs )

19:40.212 --> 19:42.347
PLEASE DON'T FLIP OUT, OKAY?

19:42.382 --> 19:45.183
I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.787
THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAY
YOU WANT, RIGHT?

19:47.819 --> 19:49.655
SO I'M BEING HONEST.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.758
GREER CAME OVER HERE
LAST NIGHT.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.192
SHE HAD NOWHERE ELSE
TO GO.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.260
SHE WAS HERE LAST NIGHT?
YOU STAYED OVERNIGHT?

19:55.295 --> 19:57.262
I GOT IN THIS HUGE FIGHT
WITH MY PARENTS

19:57.297 --> 19:59.265
AND I COULDN'T STAY THERE.
I WAS DESPERATE.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.467
IT WAS REALLY BAD.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.936
MY MOM HAS BEEN GETTING UPSET,
LIKE, EVERY DAY.

20:03.970 --> 20:07.539
I THINK SOMETHING'S GOING ON
WITH HER AND ME.

20:07.574 --> 20:11.877
I DON'T REALLY KNOW,
BUT I JUST-- I CAN'T GO HOME.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.614
- I'M SORRY, GREER.
- MOM, PLEASE,

20:14.646 --> 20:17.951
CAN SHE JUST STAY HERE
UNTIL SHE FIGURES OUT
WHAT TO DO?

20:17.983 --> 20:20.853
DO YOUR PARENTS EVEN KNOW
YOU'RE HERE?

20:20.886 --> 20:23.522
NOT EXACTLY.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.358
WELL, I'D FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE
CALLING THEM

20:26.392 --> 20:27.961
SO THEY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.

20:27.993 --> 20:31.364
I MEAN, I DON'T NEED THEM
ACCUSING ME OF ANYTHING.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.666
OKAY.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.736
( record playing )

20:36.769 --> 20:41.607
THIS SONG IS SO HAPPY-SAD.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.241
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

20:43.276 --> 20:44.544
YEAH.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.980
IT SOUNDS EVEN SADDER
ON VINYL.

20:47.012 --> 20:50.249
REMINDS ME OF WHEN I WAS,
LIKE, 12,

20:50.282 --> 20:53.286
THROWING THINGS
ACROSS MY ROOM IN A RAGE.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.454
VIOLENT KID, HUH?

20:55.488 --> 20:58.691
JUST ANGRY.

20:58.724 --> 21:01.594
BEING A LOVE CHILD
CAN DO THAT TO A GIRL,

21:01.627 --> 21:03.997
UNTIL YOU MAKE PEACE WITH IT.

21:04.029 --> 21:05.964
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

21:05.999 --> 21:10.803
I DON'T KNOW.
I GOT TIRED OF BEING ANGRY
ALL THE TIME.

21:10.836 --> 21:14.039
AND I STARTED TO SEE MY DAD
AS THIS FLAWED GUY

21:14.272 --> 21:16.843
WHO DID THE BEST THAT HE COULD,

21:16.875 --> 21:18.443
WHICH WASN'T GREAT.

21:18.478 --> 21:22.414
BUT I BASICALLY REALIZED
THAT IF I SHUT HIM OUT,

21:22.448 --> 21:24.049
I'D LOSE HIM.

21:24.282 --> 21:27.053
AND THEN I WOULDN'T
HAVE A DAD AT ALL,
SO I WENT WITH IT.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.488
AND I'M GLAD I DID.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.856
THAT'S PRETTY MATURE OF YOU.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.924
REALLY?

21:32.959 --> 21:34.527
WOW.

21:34.559 --> 21:36.663
NO ONE'S EVER
CALLED ME MATURE BEFORE.

21:36.695 --> 21:39.965
SERIOUSLY, I WISH I COULD DEAL
WITH MY STUFF LIKE THAT.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.501
DO TELL.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.569
LATER.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.605
WHY NOT NOW?

21:57.650 --> 21:59.885
WHAT?

21:59.919 --> 22:04.057
I TOLD YOU,

22:04.089 --> 22:07.460
JUST FRIENDS.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.430
I'M GETTING ALONG
REALLY WELL WITH APRIL LATELY.
I DON'T WANT TO MESS IT UP.

22:10.462 --> 22:13.865
ARE YOU REALLY GOING
TO LET GIRL CODE KEEP YOU
FROM SOMETHING?

22:13.900 --> 22:14.967
YES.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.436
I DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF GIRLFRIENDS

22:17.470 --> 22:19.038
OR HALF SISTERS.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.441
♪ ...is the air
that I breathe... ♪

22:21.473 --> 22:23.409
OKAY.

22:23.442 --> 22:25.611
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

22:25.644 --> 22:29.048
♪ All I need is the air
that I breathe... ♪

22:29.082 --> 22:32.617
THANKS FOR COMING TONIGHT
AND FOR BRINGING ME HOME.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.554
OH, YEAH,
YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL

22:34.586 --> 22:36.622
ON THE MEAN STREETS
OF BEACON HILL.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.557
HMM.

22:38.590 --> 22:41.461
YOU'RE WELCOME.
IT WASN'T AS BAD AS I THOUGHT
IT WAS GOING TO BE.

22:41.493 --> 22:43.695
YEAH.

22:45.565 --> 22:46.999
- IS EVERYTHING--
- ( knocking )

22:47.032 --> 22:49.736
UM, SORRY.

22:51.403 --> 22:52.939
JULIAN.

22:52.971 --> 22:55.407
IT'S KIND OF LATE.
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING
TO DO THIS TOMORROW.

22:55.441 --> 22:57.009
DID YOU COME HERE
BY YOURSELF?

22:57.042 --> 22:58.443
UH, NO, MY MOM DROVE ME.

22:58.478 --> 23:01.079
DON'T BOTHER.
SHE PARKED ON THE NEXT BLOCK.

23:01.114 --> 23:03.048
I HAVE A REPUTATION
TO UPHOLD, YOU KNOW.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.617
OKAY.

23:05.651 --> 23:07.452
- NOW ARE THEY FINISHED?
- UH, PLEASE.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.721
I HAVE A REPUTATION
TO UPHOLD TOO, YOU KNOW.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.758
COME ON IN.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.127
SORRY.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.097
SIGNS.
SHE'S GETTING THE SIGNS
THAT SHE PRINTED UP

23:19.132 --> 23:20.833
AT THE NEWSPAPER
FOR THE FUNDRAISER.

23:20.866 --> 23:23.635
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.
I MEAN, WE BOTH INVITED,
LIKE, TONS OF PEOPLE.

23:23.669 --> 23:25.104
THANKS FOR HELPING OUT,
BY THE WAY.

23:25.137 --> 23:27.539
OH, RIGHT.

23:27.573 --> 23:30.442
UM, I'M-- I'M SORRY, BUDDY.
I KNOW APRIL SAID
THAT I COULD DO IT,

23:30.476 --> 23:32.878
BUT I ACTUALLY--
I CAN'T.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.548
OH, UH, WHY NOT?

23:37.916 --> 23:39.951
WHY ARE YOU
GOING THROUGH ALL THIS TROUBLE?

23:39.986 --> 23:42.622
- WHAT'S-- WHAT'S HER NAME?
- WHO?

23:42.654 --> 23:45.458
COME ON,
YOU'RE A 14-YEAR-OLD BOY
ORGANIZING A FUNDRAISER.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.026
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME GIRL
INVOLVED.

23:47.058 --> 23:49.095
I'M DONATING ALL THE MONEY
WE MAKE TO THIS ORGANIZATION

23:49.127 --> 23:51.763
TO HELP MY FAMILY PAY OFF
SOME OF THE MEDICAL BILLS
LAST YEAR.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.532
OH.

23:53.566 --> 23:56.001
YOU KNOW, APRIL TOLD ME
THAT CANCER ISN'T REALLY
YOUR THING ANYMORE.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.436
I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF SAD

23:58.471 --> 24:01.106
BECAUSE PEOPLE USED TO
REALLY LOOK UP TO YOU
BECAUSE OF IT.

24:01.140 --> 24:04.911
I MEAN, HAVING PEOPLE
LOOK UP TO YOU FOR ANYTHING
IS KIND OF AWESOME.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.646
YOU SHOULDN'T TURN YOUR BACK
ON THAT,

24:07.680 --> 24:10.682
ESPECIALLY
WHEN YOUR AMAZING GIRLFRIEND
ASKS YOU TO DO IT.

24:10.715 --> 24:13.152
'CAUSE THERE ARE GIRLS
AND THEN THERE'S APRIL.

24:13.185 --> 24:16.655
SHE'S IN, LIKE,
A WHOLE DIFFERENT CATEGORY.

24:16.689 --> 24:20.992
SO EVEN THOUGH
I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR A GIRL,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.601
I'M GONNA TAKE THE SOFA,

24:28.634 --> 24:30.869
BUT I WAS WONDERING
IF WE COULD TALK FOR A SEC.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.204
YEAH, SURE.
WHAT'S UP?

24:34.207 --> 24:36.209
( closing door )

24:37.210 --> 24:39.679
UM, NOTHING MUCH,

24:42.181 --> 24:44.951
EXCEPT YOU KIND OF
KISSED ME LAST NIGHT.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.052
OH, YEAH.

24:47.086 --> 24:50.189
THAT.
( laughs )

24:50.222 --> 24:54.093
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.862
I WASN'T PLANNING IT.

24:55.894 --> 24:58.998
I MEAN, I DEFINITELY
WASN'T EXPECTING IT.

24:59.030 --> 25:01.800
BUT I DIDN'T HATE IT
EITHER.

25:01.834 --> 25:05.770
BUT I WANTED TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING,

25:05.805 --> 25:08.039
AND IT MAY SEEM
KIND OF RANDOM.

25:08.074 --> 25:11.042
IT'S ABOUT WHAT
YOU TOLD KIERAN AND ME
THAT NIGHT AT THE GALLERY.

25:11.076 --> 25:12.912
OKAY.

25:12.944 --> 25:15.080
I WAS JUST WONDERING,

25:15.114 --> 25:18.651
DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE REASON
YOU WANTED TO DATE A GIRL?

25:18.683 --> 25:21.119
I'M JUST CURIOUS
BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE.

25:21.153 --> 25:24.222
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
AFTER YOU WENT THROUGH
ALL THAT WITH THAT GUY,

25:24.257 --> 25:26.125
THAT YOU'D FEEL SAFER
WITH A GIRL.

25:28.260 --> 25:31.864
I MEAN,

25:31.897 --> 25:36.669
IT MIGHT BE THE REASON
I NEVER HAD SEX WITH KIERAN.

25:38.136 --> 25:41.840
IT'S HARD
TO GET THAT KIND OF THING
OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

25:41.874 --> 25:45.076
I STILL THINK ABOUT IT.

25:45.111 --> 25:49.949
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
I THINK ABOUT HOW OLD
THE BABY WOULD BE BY NOW

25:49.981 --> 25:54.686
OR IF HE OR SHE
WOULD BE WALKING YET.

25:58.924 --> 26:03.895
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY
I STARTED LIKING YOU.

26:03.930 --> 26:07.032
I MEAN, THAT WAS JUST

26:07.066 --> 26:09.268
ABOUT YOU.

26:10.702 --> 26:13.873
I WAS IN A DARK PLACE
BEFORE I MET YOU,

26:13.905 --> 26:17.276
BETWEEN MY DAD DYING
AND APRIL.

26:17.309 --> 26:20.112
AND THEN I STARTED
TO GET TO KNOW YOU.

26:20.145 --> 26:23.782
AND I DON'T KNOW.

26:23.816 --> 26:27.185
IT WAS LIKE THE SUN

26:27.219 --> 26:31.057
WAS FINALLY COMING OUT
AFTER A MONTH OF RAIN.

26:31.089 --> 26:34.292
OR WHATEVER, I'M SORRY.
THAT SOUNDED SUPER DUMB.

26:34.326 --> 26:37.797
NO.
IT DOESN'T.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.382
IT'S PERFECT, RIGHT?
IN A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD,

26:56.615 --> 26:58.250
SINCE THAT'S SO IMPORTANT
TO YOU.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.720
- YOU'RE ANNOYING.
- NO ELEVATOR, BUT WE'RE
ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

27:00.752 --> 27:02.221
THERE'S AN UNPRETENTIOUS
COFFEE SHOP

27:02.253 --> 27:04.123
HALF A BLOCK AWAY
FOR YOUR BLATANT CONSUMERISM.

27:04.155 --> 27:05.691
- ( laughs )
- AND THEY'RE WAIVING
THE DEPOSIT.

27:05.724 --> 27:07.727
- I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY GREAT.
- RIGHT?

27:07.759 --> 27:09.627
- YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE TWO-YEAR LEASE, RIGHT?
- YUP.

27:09.662 --> 27:12.030
- WAIT, WHAT?
- THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO DEPOSIT.

27:12.064 --> 27:13.365
THE LEASE IS A LITTLE LONGER.

27:13.398 --> 27:15.067
TWO YEARS ISN'T A LITTLE.

27:15.101 --> 27:18.069
I-- I'D ASSUMED, LIKE,
SIX MONTHS.

27:18.104 --> 27:19.939
WHY WOULD YOU ASSUME
SIX MONTHS?

27:19.971 --> 27:21.740
I MEAN, MOST LEASES
ARE, LIKE, A YEAR.

27:21.773 --> 27:24.276
BECAUSE THE LAST TWO
THAT I SIGNED WERE
FOR SIX MONTHS,

27:24.309 --> 27:27.012
YOU KNOW,
WITH OPTIONS TO GO
MONTH-TO-MONTH AFTERWARDS.

27:27.046 --> 27:31.282
SO YOU'RE LITERALLY
SAYING THAT YOU WANT
A SHORT-TERM COMMITMENT.

27:31.317 --> 27:34.420
TWO YEARS JUST SEEMS
LIKE A REALLY LONG TIME.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.922
YOU KNOW, WHO EVEN KNOWS
WHERE WE'LL BE IN A YEAR?

27:36.955 --> 27:39.025
I MEAN, I ASSUME
WE'LL WANT TO BE HERE,

27:39.057 --> 27:40.759
LIVING TOGETHER, RIGHT?

27:40.792 --> 27:42.761
I'M SORRY, I'M TRYING.
I REALLY AM.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.763
I JUST HAVEN'T LIVED ANYWHERE
FOR THIS LONG,

27:44.797 --> 27:45.964
SINCE I LEFT HOME.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.034
YOU DO REALIZE THAT
IT'S GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE

27:48.067 --> 27:50.435
TO FIND EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT
WITH A SIX-MONTH LEASE.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.971
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS ASK.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.241
WOW. I GUESS IT'S TRUE
WHAT THEY SAY

27:56.275 --> 27:57.910
ABOUT PEOPLE
OF YOUR GENERATION,

27:57.942 --> 27:59.412
JUST ALWAYS WANTING
EVERYTHING ON THEIR TERMS.

27:59.444 --> 28:01.814
MY GENERATION?
GRAHAM, YOU'RE 29.

28:01.846 --> 28:04.817
WELL, SOMETIMES YOU ACT
LIKE A VERY YOUNG 23.

28:06.384 --> 28:08.721
DID I MENTION
WE ALLOW LARGE PETS?

28:12.157 --> 28:14.727
( knocking on door )

28:18.029 --> 28:19.164
SARA.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.967
WE NEED TO FINISH
OUR CONVERSATION.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.303
OKAY.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.376
I WANT TO KNOW WHY
YOU CHEATED ON YOUR WIFE.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.181
YOU'RE JUST JUMPING
RIGHT IN THERE, HUH?

28:35.213 --> 28:37.282
I'M SORRY, DID YOU WANT
TO HAVE SMALL TALK?

28:37.316 --> 28:39.151
I MEAN, I KIND OF THINK
WE'RE PAST THAT.

28:39.184 --> 28:41.353
OKAY.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.256
UM, IT'S COMPLICATED.

28:44.289 --> 28:45.990
AGAIN WITH THE "COMPLICATED."

28:46.025 --> 28:47.992
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
WELL, LET'S SEE.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.828
YOUR NEEDS
WERE NOT BEING MET,

28:49.862 --> 28:52.498
YOUR MASCULINITY
WAS THREATENED AND
YOU NEEDED VALIDATION,

28:52.730 --> 28:57.135
SO YOU STRAYED SEXUALLY.
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE BEARD.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.404
YOU'RE WRONG.

29:03.308 --> 29:06.311
OKAY. YOU KNOW,
MAYBE WHAT I'M WONDERING

29:06.345 --> 29:09.481
IS ARE YOU STILL ATTRACTED
TO YOUR WIFE?

29:09.515 --> 29:12.484
YES.
ABSOLUTELY.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.920
BUT ARE YOU STILL
IN LOVE WITH HER?

29:14.953 --> 29:17.155
VERY MUCH.

29:17.189 --> 29:19.924
MORE THAN SHE PROBABLY KNOWS.

29:19.959 --> 29:24.762
LOOK, BEFORE VIVIAN AND I
EVEN GOT MARRIED,

29:24.797 --> 29:28.267
WE TALKED ABOUT CHEATING,
HOW WE FELT ABOUT IT,

29:28.299 --> 29:31.971
AND IF IT WAS JUST PHYSICAL,
THAT WE'D RATHER NOT KNOW.

29:32.003 --> 29:35.840
'CAUSE YOU KNOW,
LIFE IS LONG.

29:35.875 --> 29:38.243
AND SO IF WE WENT
THROUGH A PHASE WHERE
WE WERE FEELING A LITTLE--

29:38.277 --> 29:40.980
SHE PROBABLY TOLD YOU THAT
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR.

29:41.012 --> 29:43.781
NO, SARA.

29:43.816 --> 29:46.317
( chuckles )
YOU DON'T KNOW HER.

29:48.420 --> 29:49.888
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

29:49.922 --> 29:53.491
WELL, VIVIAN AND I HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO GET PREGNANT

29:53.526 --> 29:55.493
FOR YEARS.

29:55.528 --> 29:59.832
AND WE'RE ON
OUR FOURTH ROUND OF I.V.F.

29:59.865 --> 30:01.567
WE NEVER HAVE SEX ANYMORE.

30:01.799 --> 30:06.571
AND WHEN WE DO,
IT'S SO CLINICAL.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.874
AND THE STRESS
HAS JUST MADE US

30:08.907 --> 30:11.042
NEED SOME SPACE
FROM EACH OTHER.

30:11.076 --> 30:15.013
BUT I DO THINK THAT WE'RE GOING
TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK

30:15.047 --> 30:16.815
AND GET BACK
TO A GOOD PLACE, THOUGH.

30:16.848 --> 30:18.817
AND SO WHEN WE DO,

30:18.851 --> 30:22.253
YOU KNOW, I THINK
WHAT VIVIAN DOESN'T KNOW
WON'T HURT HER.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.856
AND FOR ALL I KNOW,
SHE'S DOING THE SAME THING.

30:24.890 --> 30:27.026
AND YOU REALLY
WOULDN'T WANT TO KNOW?

30:27.058 --> 30:31.196
WELL, AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WHAT GOOD IS THAT GOING
TO DO ME?

30:31.230 --> 30:33.065
I MEAN, IF YOU HAD FOUND OUT

30:33.097 --> 30:35.867
THAT YOUR HUSBAND
WAS CHEATING ON YOU
RIGHT AFTER IT HAPPENED,

30:35.901 --> 30:39.003
DO YOU THINK YOUR LIFE
WOULD BE BETTER?

30:43.541 --> 30:46.578
( both giggling )

30:46.612 --> 30:50.015
THANK YOU GUYS
SO MUCH FOR HELPING OUT
WITH THE FUNDRAISER TODAY.

30:50.048 --> 30:52.084
IS LEO MEETING US THERE?

30:52.116 --> 30:54.420
UM, I DON'T THINK SO.
I DON'T KNOW.

30:54.452 --> 30:56.087
IT'S KIND OF A BUMMER,
ACTUALLY.

30:56.121 --> 30:58.423
- ( doorbell rings )
- April: I'LL GET IT.

31:02.193 --> 31:05.330
( both laughing )

31:05.364 --> 31:07.633
GREER?

31:09.401 --> 31:11.537
- BRENNA.
- Father: WE GOT A CALL FROM
YOUR MOTHER, BRENNA.

31:11.569 --> 31:12.938
SHE SAID YOU WERE HERE.

31:12.971 --> 31:14.640
YOU COULD HAVE CALLED FIRST.
WE WERE JUST--

31:14.873 --> 31:16.541
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH BRENNA.

31:16.575 --> 31:19.644
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I CAN ACTUALLY THINK FOR MYSELF.

31:19.877 --> 31:22.347
Mother:
WE'RE NOT IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR JUDGMENT.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.183
OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT.
NOTHING I DO EVER IMPRESSES YOU,
MOM.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.118
YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE.

31:27.152 --> 31:29.020
AND YOU KNOW,
IT'S REALLY HARD GROWING UP

31:29.054 --> 31:30.990
THINKING NOTHING I DO
IS GOOD ENOUGH.

31:31.022 --> 31:33.625
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.493
GET YOUR THINGS.
YOU'RE COMING HOME.

31:35.527 --> 31:39.664
NO. YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE TOWN
AND THEN SHOW UP

31:39.897 --> 31:42.534
AND PRETEND YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT MY LIFE.

31:42.567 --> 31:46.038
LIKE, I WENT OFF MY MEDS
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.973
YOU LET NANNIES
AND PSYCHIATRISTS RAISE ME

31:49.008 --> 31:52.644
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO DO.
YOU SUCK AS PARENTS.

31:52.677 --> 31:55.681
OH, AND BY THE WAY, MOM,
THERE IS NO WAY

31:55.913 --> 31:57.482
I'M GOING TO BOARDING SCHOOL.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.117
WHAT'S SHE TALKING ABOUT?

31:59.151 --> 32:01.987
- WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.
- GO AHEAD,

32:02.020 --> 32:03.989
THREATEN TO WITHHOLD MONEY
FROM ME.

32:04.022 --> 32:07.960
I'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.
I'LL BE STAYING WITH BRENNA

32:07.992 --> 32:10.663
UNTIL YOU LEARN HOW TO TREAT ME
WITH SOME RESPECT.

32:12.431 --> 32:13.598
OKAY.

32:15.200 --> 32:18.103
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY
LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE,
WE WON'T STOP YOU.

32:32.718 --> 32:36.221
YOU'RE KIND OF MY HERO
RIGHT NOW.

32:42.060 --> 32:44.028
HEY.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.364
HEY.

32:46.699 --> 32:49.535
- UM, DO YOU WANT TO COME IN?
- AM I ALLOWED?

32:49.567 --> 32:51.103
I KIND OF THOUGHT
AFTER THIS MORNING,

32:51.135 --> 32:53.038
YOU MIGHT MAKE ME TALK TO YOU
OUT IN THE HALLWAY.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.972
THE HALLWAY? COME ON.

32:55.007 --> 32:57.409
NO, THERE'S A PERFECTLY
GOOD CLOSET RIGHT OVER THERE.

33:05.384 --> 33:09.721
UH, HEY, SO I--
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT EARLIER.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.323
ME TOO. IT'S--

33:11.356 --> 33:14.526
THIS-- THIS IS JUST HARD.

33:14.559 --> 33:15.760
YOU KNOW?

33:15.993 --> 33:19.064
WELL, I'M ABOUT TO MAKE IT
REALLY SIMPLE FOR US.

33:19.097 --> 33:20.766
SO AGAINST ALL ODDS,

33:20.999 --> 33:23.067
AND I MEAN ALL,

33:23.102 --> 33:26.372
I FOUND US ANOTHER PLACE,
MEETS OUR NEEDS,

33:26.404 --> 33:28.606
INCLUDING YOUR NEED
FOR A SIX-MONTH LEASE.

33:28.640 --> 33:31.376
ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS SIGN.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.215
WOW.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.617
OR-- OR NOT.

33:39.651 --> 33:42.354
CAN I--
CAN I JUST HAVE A SECOND?

33:42.387 --> 33:44.757
- YEAH YEAH. WHAT'S WRONG?
- I JUST--

33:44.789 --> 33:47.759
THIS JUST, UH...

33:47.792 --> 33:50.261
WOW, IT FEELS REALLY FAST,
DOESN'T IT?

33:50.295 --> 33:52.330
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

33:52.364 --> 33:56.734
I MEAN, US MOVING IN.
( laughs )

33:56.769 --> 34:00.138
YOU-- YOU'RE BRINGING THIS UP
NOW?

34:00.172 --> 34:02.473
I'M GIVING YOU EVERYTHING
THAT YOU WANT.

34:02.508 --> 34:05.644
YEAH, I--
I DON'T KNOW.

34:05.676 --> 34:09.447
I THINK I JUST--
I-- I NEED TO

34:09.481 --> 34:13.217
THINK ABOUT IT MORE.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.190
OKAY.

34:25.097 --> 34:27.331
( chattering )

34:33.271 --> 34:35.574
IS IT PETTY
TO BE DISAPPOINTED

34:35.606 --> 34:38.443
THAT LEO IS CLEARLY
NOT EVEN SHOWING UP?

34:38.476 --> 34:41.112
I MEAN, IT'S JUST THIS ONE THING
I ASKED HIM TO DO.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.650
ARE YOU RIGHT AND THIS
IS JUST ANOTHER RED FLAG

34:44.682 --> 34:47.318
THAT HE'S GOING
TO HURT ME AGAIN?

34:47.351 --> 34:49.621
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:51.489 --> 34:54.226
I AM LITERALLY THE WORST PERSON
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

34:54.259 --> 34:56.862
HE WAS TOTALLY
BENDING OVER BACKWARDS

34:57.094 --> 34:59.731
TO GIVE ME EVERYTHING
THAT I WANTED AND BEING
SO FLEXIBLE.

34:59.764 --> 35:03.235
- GRAHAM?
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

35:03.268 --> 35:05.871
I USED TO LOVE
HAVING THE FREEDOM

35:06.103 --> 35:07.139
TO JUST LEAVE
AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE.

35:07.172 --> 35:08.306
YOU KNOW,
LIVE IN DIFFERENT PLACES.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.342
AND NOW I HAVE THIS JOB
THAT DEPENDS ON ME

35:10.375 --> 35:12.643
AND A BOYFRIEND
THAT WANTS TO LIVE WITH ME
FOR, LIKE, EVER.

35:12.677 --> 35:15.813
OH, I DON'T THINK I'M READY
TO BE THIS GROWN-UP.

35:15.847 --> 35:18.851
I'M-- I'M JUST--
I'M NOT USED TO THIS KIND
OF PERMANENCE, YOU KNOW?

35:18.884 --> 35:23.722
BETH, THERE ARE
SO MANY STEPS BEFORE THIS
IS A PERMANENT COMMITMENT.

35:23.755 --> 35:25.791
YOU CAN ALWAYS BREAK A LEASE.

35:25.824 --> 35:29.293
THIS IS JUST ONE SMALL STEP
DOWN THE ROAD

35:29.327 --> 35:31.396
OF BEING TOGETHER FOR REAL.

35:32.697 --> 35:35.233
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
GOD, YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

35:35.266 --> 35:38.704
I'VE-- I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO LOSE HIM OVER THIS.

35:38.737 --> 35:41.606
MAYBE WE BOTH NEED
TO COMPROMISE A LITTLE MORE.

35:41.639 --> 35:45.210
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I NEED
TO MANAGE MY EXPECTATIONS
BETTER WITH LEO.

35:45.244 --> 35:47.646
I MEAN, HE'S DEALING
WITH A LOT OF STUFF RIGHT NOW.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.815
SO MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
LET HIM BE WHO HE IS.

35:50.849 --> 35:54.219
Leo ( amplified ):
TESTING, ONE TWO.

35:54.253 --> 35:56.521
HELLO HELLO.
THIS THING ON?

35:56.554 --> 35:57.922
- HELLO?
- ( feedback )

35:58.155 --> 36:00.192
OH, A LITTLE FEEDBACK.

36:00.224 --> 36:02.927
TESTING.
THERE WE GO.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.463
HEY, GUYS.

36:11.936 --> 36:13.572
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE ALL GOING THROUGH.

36:13.605 --> 36:17.775
THINKING MAYBE IF I'M LUCKY,
I GOT A YEAR LEFT,

36:17.809 --> 36:22.246
OR TWO IF I GET INTO
THAT CLINICAL TRIAL, RIGHT?

36:22.280 --> 36:25.449
I NEVER EXPECTED TO TURN 22,
LET ALONE 25.

36:25.483 --> 36:29.387
NOW I'M NOT HERE BECAUSE
I THINK I CAN CURE CANCER,

36:29.420 --> 36:31.456
ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
( laughs )

36:31.489 --> 36:36.228
BUT MAYBE I CAN BE AN EXAMPLE

36:36.260 --> 36:38.396
OF SOMEONE WHO BEAT THE ODDS.
BECAUSE IT HAPPENS.

36:38.429 --> 36:42.601
NOW WE ALL HAVE PRIVATE PARTS,

36:42.634 --> 36:44.969
BUT THERE'S ONE PART
I CONSIDER PRIVATE

36:45.202 --> 36:46.438
THAT NOT EVERYONE DOES.

36:46.471 --> 36:49.273
THE HEART.

36:49.307 --> 36:52.311
IT'S A VULNERABLE ORGAN.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.278
IT BREAKS EASILY.

36:54.313 --> 36:58.449
AND SOME PEOPLE
ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO KNOW
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

36:58.483 --> 37:01.253
WHEN IT'S--
WHEN IT'S FULL.

37:01.286 --> 37:03.322
AND THEN
THERE'S EVERYBODY ELSE.

37:05.590 --> 37:07.525
I HAPPEN TO BE
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.728
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE BEFORE.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.530
OR I HADN'T

37:12.563 --> 37:14.231
UNTIL NOW.

37:16.601 --> 37:18.570
HE'S NEVER SAID THAT BEFORE.

37:18.603 --> 37:22.907
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.
I APPROVE, BY THE WAY.

37:22.940 --> 37:25.577
I ALMOST
DIDN'T COME HERE TODAY.

37:25.610 --> 37:28.547
BUT SINCE I'VE SOMEHOW
MANAGED TO STAY ALIVE,

37:28.579 --> 37:30.548
I WANT TO LIVE THE RIGHT WAY.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.284
I WANT TO BE THE GUY
THAT STEPS UP,

37:32.317 --> 37:36.655
I WANT TO BE THE GUY
THAT PEOPLE SHOULDN'T EVER
UNDERESTIMATE.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.826
LOVE WILL DO THAT TO YOU,
I GUESS.

37:40.858 --> 37:43.862
YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF
DOING THINGS

37:43.894 --> 37:47.833
YOU NEVER COULD IMAGINE
IN A MILLION YEARS.

37:57.675 --> 38:00.679
( all applauding )

38:03.447 --> 38:05.650
( laughs )

38:22.668 --> 38:24.001
Sara:
I GOT GOOSE BUMPS.

38:24.036 --> 38:25.536
IT WAS SO ROMANTIC!

38:25.570 --> 38:27.338
AND IN FRONT
OF ALL THESE PEOPLE.

38:27.371 --> 38:30.409
HE'S SO GREAT.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.543
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WEREN'T
JUST HOOKING UP

38:32.577 --> 38:34.545
WITH YOUR IMMIGRATION LAWYER
NEXT DOOR,

38:34.579 --> 38:36.547
MAYBE HE WOULD
PROFESS HIS LOVE FOR YOU

38:36.581 --> 38:38.550
ON THE COURTHOUSE STEPS.

38:38.583 --> 38:41.052
UNLIKELY.
THINGS HAVE BECOME COMPLICATED.

38:41.085 --> 38:42.788
ARE YOU OKAY?

38:42.820 --> 38:44.588
I'M FINE.
YEAH, MORE THAN FINE.

38:44.623 --> 38:48.492
I ACTUALLY THINK SOME--
SOME GOOD MAY HAVE COME FROM IT.

38:48.527 --> 38:50.494
DO I WANT TO HEAR THIS?

38:50.528 --> 38:52.864
IT GOT ME THINKING
ABOUT YOUR FATHER

38:52.898 --> 38:56.867
AND HOW I'VE BEEN REPRESSING
A LOT OF ANGER.

38:56.902 --> 38:58.936
REALLY TOXIC STUFF.

38:58.969 --> 39:01.639
AND I ACTUALLY REALIZE THAT

39:01.672 --> 39:04.976
IF THINGS HADN'T HAPPENED
HOW THEY DID,

39:05.010 --> 39:08.413
EVEN THE REALLY PAINFUL PARTS,

39:08.447 --> 39:09.981
I WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT
ON SOME OF THE GREAT THINGS.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.583
( girls giggling )

39:11.615 --> 39:14.719
I WOULDN'T BE
WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW,

39:14.753 --> 39:17.889
WHICH IS PRETTY HAPPY.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.530
SO THEY HAVEN'T TRIED
TO CALL YOU OR ANYTHING?

39:25.563 --> 39:27.398
I THINK I SCARED THEM.

39:27.431 --> 39:29.768
OH, GOOD.
