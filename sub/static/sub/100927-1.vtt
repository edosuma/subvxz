03:43.541 --> 03:48.410
Mr. Eiseley, my condolences.
He was a good man.

03:48.412 --> 03:53.683
He was a good man.
Thank you for coming out.

03:54.151 --> 03:57.088
Mr. Eiseley!

03:59.457 --> 04:02.426
Your father owes my bank $5,000.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.758
Owes?

04:03.760 --> 04:05.394
That's right.

04:05.396 --> 04:08.332
Does a man have to keep paying
his debts even after he's dead?

04:09.266 --> 04:10.633
In fact he does.

04:10.935 --> 04:13.003
That's ridiculous.

04:14.405 --> 04:16.974
The foreclosure
is effective immediately, sir.

04:19.209 --> 04:21.077
Jimmy!

04:22.745 --> 04:23.912

08:15.845 --> 08:18.082
Jesus Christ!

08:43.440 --> 08:45.976
What are you looking at, Indian?

08:51.782 --> 08:53.415
I bet ya he's gonna try to

08:53.417 --> 08:56.620
scalp us in the middle of
the night. Ain't ya Indian?

08:57.287 --> 08:59.656
Would you shut up and play.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.994
Ain't ya?

09:42.766 --> 09:44.733
Thanks.

09:44.735 --> 09:46.701
Name's Joe Running Elk.

09:46.703 --> 09:48.539
Stratton Eiseley.

11:13.524 --> 11:15.325
Alright, here we go.

11:44.521 --> 11:46.189
So uh...

11:46.590 --> 11:48.657
what brought you down here?

11:48.659 --> 11:51.159
Oh, I came down here
hoping to find some work

11:51.161 --> 11:53.297
on the railroad, but

11:53.597 --> 11:56.567
It's not often
enough that we find it.

12:00.437 --> 12:02.639
What about you, what do you do?

12:04.074 --> 12:07.108
I don't know anymore.

12:07.110 --> 12:10.645
Four percent
of the American people

12:10.647 --> 12:15.250
own eighty five percent
of the wealth of America.

12:15.252 --> 12:18.653
How
many men ever went to a barbecue

12:18.655 --> 12:21.423
and would let one man
take off the table what's

12:21.425 --> 12:24.259
intended for nine-tenths
of the people to eat?

12:24.261 --> 12:26.494
What's Morgan, and Baruch, and

12:26.496 --> 12:29.266
Rockefeller, and Mellon
gonna do with all that grub?

12:30.001 --> 12:33.770
Leave something else for the
American people to consume!

12:34.104 --> 12:38.308
We say to America 125 million

12:38.542 --> 12:39.909
Hey Gus.

12:39.911 --> 12:41.043
Hey Stratton.

12:41.045 --> 12:42.177
Could I use your phone?

12:42.179 --> 12:43.144
You bet.

12:43.146 --> 12:44.446
Thanks.

12:44.448 --> 12:48.416
No luxurious mansions empty!

12:48.418 --> 12:51.319
None walking the streets.

12:51.321 --> 12:53.757
None impoverished!

12:54.358 --> 12:56.025
None in war!

12:56.027 --> 12:59.761
But that all may live in the
land that the Lord has provided

13:00.898 --> 13:02.733
Could I have 1868 please?

13:03.734 --> 13:05.268
Thank you.

13:10.140 --> 13:12.442
How are you Susan?

13:14.879 --> 13:18.448
I was uh I
was wondering um

13:21.485 --> 13:23.888
I was wondering if I
could borrow some money?

13:26.390 --> 13:29.292
Susan, you
know this isn't easy for me.

13:32.429 --> 13:34.598
The bank took everything.

13:37.035 --> 13:38.903
Damn right it is!

13:39.603 --> 13:41.772
What the hell is
that suppose to mean?

13:51.015 --> 13:53.415
Well while your at it, why don't
you uh, pin the stock market

13:53.417 --> 13:54.852
crash on us too!

14:00.791 --> 14:02.793
Shit!

14:20.410 --> 14:23.012
Well I better be off Gus.

14:23.014 --> 14:24.146
Alright, we'll see ya.

14:24.148 --> 14:25.615
Thank you.

14:27.818 --> 14:29.921
Alright,
tell me your grand idea.

14:36.027 --> 14:38.228
Alcohol.

14:41.099 --> 14:43.565
You want us to make liquor?

14:43.567 --> 14:45.333
What do you say huh?

14:45.335 --> 14:46.768
Partners in crime?

14:46.770 --> 14:48.570
Are you crazy?
We can't make moonshine here!

14:48.572 --> 14:51.573
Not here. The mountains.

14:51.575 --> 14:53.844
Ah, I
don't know Stratton

14:59.884 --> 15:03.587
I look around and I
see a lot of people waiting.

15:05.857 --> 15:10.692
Waiting for food, waiting for
jobs, waiting for the dollar

15:10.694 --> 15:12.662
waiting for it to improve.

15:21.304 --> 15:23.306
Look at that open space.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.879
There's
a life up there to be lived.

15:34.584 --> 15:36.518
What about supplies?
We don't have anything.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.890
I kept a few
things from my pop's place.

15:39.190 --> 15:40.925
Enough to get us started.

15:47.798 --> 15:52.369
Alright. Alright, we'll do it.

15:53.905 --> 15:57.074
We just going to
have to convince Grandpa

16:01.012 --> 16:04.081
I don't
think this is a good idea.

16:06.117 --> 16:08.052
It'll be like it was before.

16:09.619 --> 16:13.124
We can hunt and
live in the old ways again.

16:13.925 --> 16:18.495
We never sold whiskey,
it's not the Indian way.

16:19.629 --> 16:22.200
That's the only difference.

16:23.267 --> 16:27.337
And we don't have to live by the
White's laws anymore.

16:28.172 --> 16:30.407
What if they find us?

16:32.210 --> 16:36.013
No, Stratton, he knows of place
where we'll never be found.

Put it on my tab Gus.

17:15.652 --> 17:18.386
Joe I told you
the last time, you're over your

17:18.387 --> 17:20.521
limit and you still owe us $24.

17:20.522 --> 17:22.090
Twenty four?

17:22.093 --> 17:23.590
What if we pay cash?

17:23.593 --> 17:27.595
Boss said we got to make even on
tabs before I serve you again.

17:27.597 --> 17:29.599
Alright Gus.

17:30.968 --> 17:34.939
Here's uh
30 cents for the whiskey

17:35.805 --> 17:40.011
and here's 30 cents for
you to give them to me.

17:41.711 --> 17:44.282
Alright, but its the last time!

17:44.781 --> 17:46.984
You're my man Gus!

17:56.826 --> 17:58.760
When money's
tight and hard to get,

17:58.762 --> 18:01.332
and your horse is an also ran,

18:01.665 --> 18:03.633
when a pile
of debt is all you got,

18:04.035 --> 18:07.369
glass a whiskey,
is your only man.

18:07.371 --> 18:09.206
I'll drink to that.

18:16.013 --> 18:19.482
So uh, when did
your people start ranching?

18:19.917 --> 18:22.353
I must've been
about eight or nine.

18:23.220 --> 18:26.924
When we were younger,
we were still hunters, but

18:28.092 --> 18:29.860
times change.

18:30.760 --> 18:33.097
It's tough for Grandpa.

18:35.498 --> 18:38.000
When the spring comes
I can see it in his eyes,

18:38.002 --> 18:42.004
he's, he still seems to be
searching the horizon waiting

18:42.006 --> 18:44.574
for the buffalo to return.

18:46.377 --> 18:48.511
You know they never do.

18:51.514 --> 18:54.251
Those teepee
days are gone for good.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.021
That's a shame.

18:58.222 --> 18:59.787
Hey Joe!

18:59.789 --> 19:01.892
You want to
make some money?

19:02.826 --> 19:05.294
This here's
Whistler, he handles our runs.

19:05.296 --> 19:08.197
Whistler here's the list,
show the boys the store room.

19:08.199 --> 19:10.633
Alright, come on boys.

19:13.971 --> 19:16.105
How about a
topic, before Rhett

19:16.107 --> 19:19.443
drowns himself
in a dreamy whiskey sea.

19:19.944 --> 19:22.211
How about
something on the frontier?

19:28.618 --> 19:32.189
Uh, Grace Loren?

19:32.622 --> 19:36.293
Yes, yes I'm
Gracie, call me Gracie.

19:36.693 --> 19:38.828
Stratton Eiseley.

19:41.132 --> 19:43.365
Alright where do
you want the whiskey?

19:43.367 --> 19:46.270
Oh, just stack them over here.

19:51.409 --> 19:56.613
"I wanted to live deep and
suck out all the marrow of life"

19:57.014 --> 19:59.448
"..to drive life into a corner.
And reduce

19:59.450 --> 20:02.217
it to its lowest terms,
and if it proved to be mean,

20:02.219 --> 20:05.588
well, get to the whole
and genuine meanness of it."

20:08.825 --> 20:11.761
It's a pleasure
to meet you folks.

21:13.357 --> 21:15.656
You shouldn't be here son

21:15.658 --> 21:16.724
I'm sorry

21:16.726 --> 21:17.926
this is private property.

21:17.928 --> 21:19.561
didn't have anywhere to sleep.

21:19.563 --> 21:23.367
Well, I'm sorry about that,
but I can't have you here.

21:24.602 --> 21:28.472
Listen, do you think I can just
sleep here a couple more hours?

21:28.838 --> 21:31.008
I'll be out by
first light, I promise.

21:31.275 --> 21:32.407
Well...

21:32.409 --> 21:33.944
I'd awfully appreciate it.

21:34.445 --> 21:37.414
You be sure to be
out of here real early.

21:37.982 --> 21:39.915
And please don't
make a habit of this.

21:39.917 --> 21:41.183
No sir, I won't.

21:41.185 --> 21:42.251
Okay.

21:42.253 --> 21:44.054
Thank you.

22:46.183 --> 22:47.249
Hey!

22:48.652 --> 22:51.587
Jeez, Stratton. You
scared the hell out of me.

22:51.589 --> 22:53.956
What you doing
sleeping on the job Whistler?

22:55.025 --> 22:56.592
What if I'd been Jim Harris?

22:56.594 --> 22:58.093
Thank God you ain't!

22:58.095 --> 23:00.197
That be like waking up
to a rattler in your pants.

23:01.699 --> 23:03.332
Well, what can I do for you?

23:03.334 --> 23:06.769
Well. What do you say to
me taking over for the night?

23:08.872 --> 23:10.805
Uh, I don't
know. I need the money

23:10.807 --> 23:12.509
We'll split it 50-50.

23:12.943 --> 23:14.042
What's the catch?

23:14.044 --> 23:17.448
No catch. I need the money too.

23:19.350 --> 23:20.985
50-50?

23:21.585 --> 23:26.688
Alright, I can do that.
Yeah. Here's your list.

23:26.690 --> 23:28.457
I suppose you know the rest.

23:28.459 --> 23:29.591
You bet.

23:29.593 --> 23:31.960
Thanks a lot,
you have a good night.

23:31.962 --> 23:34.164
You too Whistler.

23:49.079 --> 23:51.814

the bend and then pull over!

28:24.989 --> 28:27.188
You want to go for a walk, maybe

28:27.190 --> 28:28.657
get out of
here for a little bit?

28:29.660 --> 28:30.794
Yes.

28:32.195 --> 28:34.064
My father didn't have
much faith in the government,

28:34.765 --> 28:38.400
so ranching was a way
to get him out of town and

28:38.402 --> 28:40.170
pretty much out of the system.

28:41.605 --> 28:43.538
But today, there's too many damn
laws and regulations you know

28:43.540 --> 28:45.373
Thomas Jefferson, he envisioned

28:45.375 --> 28:49.177
a country governed
and supported by farmers,

28:49.179 --> 28:51.881
but today
the government just tries to rip

28:51.883 --> 28:54.284
the rug right
out from under them.

28:55.686 --> 28:59.556
The way I see it,
moonshine can't be regulated.

29:01.258 --> 29:03.760
They either
catch me, or they don't.

29:09.033 --> 29:10.868
So you're a writer.

29:11.234 --> 29:13.136
How did you know I'm a writer?

29:13.403 --> 29:16.106
I mean, who else
quotes Thoreau at a party?

29:19.643 --> 29:21.343
What kind of stuff do you write?

29:21.345 --> 29:23.513
I'm a novelist

29:24.481 --> 29:26.851
but lately, I've
been writing screenplays.

29:27.284 --> 29:29.119
You write for the pictures?

29:30.420 --> 29:31.486
So surprised?

29:31.488 --> 29:33.455
No, no, I just ain't never seen

29:33.457 --> 29:35.256
a picture written
by a woman that's all.

29:35.258 --> 29:36.524
Does that mean I can't?

29:36.526 --> 29:39.194
No, no,
I'm just making an observation.

29:39.196 --> 29:42.130
Yeah well, I don't think a pair
of testicles is gonna make me

29:42.132 --> 29:45.533
any better at writing stories
and putting them down on paper.

29:45.535 --> 29:47.636
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to

29:47.638 --> 29:49.206
Uh huh.

29:52.809 --> 29:55.880
So you're a writer.

30:29.013 --> 30:32.547
Long ago,
some grizzlies turned themselves

30:32.549 --> 30:36.921
into human beings and
came to live among my people.

30:39.623 --> 30:41.690
They dressed in bear skins and

30:41.692 --> 30:44.929
wore bear claw necklaces.

30:53.037 --> 30:56.740
And they would rub red
clay into their bodies so hard,

30:57.541 --> 30:59.676
they'd be covered in blood.

31:05.315 --> 31:08.251
The bear people
killed every enemy.

31:10.787 --> 31:13.490
If one of their own was killed,

31:15.059 --> 31:17.895
their medicine was so strong,

31:18.996 --> 31:23.366
they could bring
the dead back to life.

31:34.377 --> 31:38.313
One day, a warrior
from my tribe named Owl,

31:38.315 --> 31:40.850
lost in battle and went to the

31:40.852 --> 31:43.320
leader of the
Bear Clan for help.

31:48.458 --> 31:50.995
The chief of
the bears said this

31:56.234 --> 32:01.438
"I am chief of
the bears! I cannot be killed!

32:08.578 --> 32:11.883
I have brought you here
to give you my medicine."

32:15.920 --> 32:19.422
From then on, Owl
could not be killed in battle.

32:25.595 --> 32:27.865
That
is the story of the Bear People,

32:29.000 --> 32:33.770
who were great healers
and could never be killed.

33:28.025 --> 33:29.992
The smoke
will protect you from

33:29.994 --> 33:33.597
the elk's nose
and bring you no harm.

34:18.976 --> 34:22.947
You go up around towards the
meadow and I'll come around.

34:23.313 --> 34:24.579
Good luck.

34:24.581 --> 34:26.616
Yep, you too.

37:29.934 --> 37:31.801
Did you see anything?

37:35.206 --> 37:37.039
Stratton?

37:37.041 --> 37:39.174
Did you see anything?

37:39.176 --> 37:41.744
Uh no.

38:19.682 --> 38:22.951
You want to, you want to line
this bead up on the end now,

38:22.953 --> 38:25.788
with your notch back here.

38:26.123 --> 38:29.358
And it's important to keep it
firm against your shoulder

38:29.360 --> 38:32.427
otherwise it'll
knock the hell out of you.

38:32.429 --> 38:35.633
Now I don't want to overload
you with too many things but,

38:36.066 --> 38:40.004
you want to exhale
just before you take your shot

38:40.905 --> 38:42.540
and when you do

38:42.907 --> 38:44.640
You
don't want to pull the trigger,

38:44.642 --> 38:47.710
you just
want to slowly squeeze it.

38:48.745 --> 38:50.713
Alright?

38:51.549 --> 38:53.217
Let me
go set the cans up.

38:59.789 --> 39:00.821
Okay

39:00.823 --> 39:02.424
You ready?

39:02.426 --> 39:05.894
Yeah, I think so.

39:05.896 --> 39:07.164
Like this?

39:08.232 --> 39:09.830
Yep, yeah uh, now uh
make sure you hold it tight.

39:09.832 --> 39:12.002
And
make sure you line up that bead.

39:25.316 --> 39:27.184
I didn't
know you knew how to shoot.

39:27.651 --> 39:30.387

think to ask me now did ya?

40:40.591 --> 40:44.028
with your soda
pop deliveries around town.

40:44.595 --> 40:46.263

Nah, I got this one.

47:27.431 --> 47:29.232
Hold it right there Stratton!

Mabel, uh 1243

48:10.807 --> 48:12.375
Shit!

48:17.814 --> 48:19.414
Alright, back to your cell.

48:19.416 --> 48:20.815
Hold on it didn't go through.

48:20.817 --> 48:23.953
One call, that's the
rule. Back to your cell.

48:23.955 --> 48:27.791
One call that
goes through that's the rule.

48:28.226 --> 48:30.293
Back to your cell.

48:41.772 --> 48:42.771
1243!

49:33.024 --> 49:35.590
"Where
in the past ye walked

49:35.592 --> 49:38.793
according to
the course of this world,

49:38.795 --> 49:41.798
according
to the power of the air.

49:45.136 --> 49:50.540
The same spirit now worketh in
the children of disobedience,

49:52.342 --> 49:54.143
among whom we had our

49:54.145 --> 49:57.447
conversations about the lusts
of the flesh and of the mind

49:58.049 --> 50:02.786
and were by nature
the children of wrath."

50:46.264 --> 50:48.099
Damn it.

50:49.367 --> 50:52.201
Oh its nothing under
heaven but an attempt to bind

50:52.203 --> 50:54.502
and rivet the old
breweries and the old

50:54.504 --> 50:55.905
distilleries around the neck of

50:55.907 --> 50:57.772
the American
people for their own profit.

50:57.774 --> 50:59.875
Where will
the money come from?

50:59.877 --> 51:01.243
They say that Uncle Sam"

51:02.412 --> 51:04.015
So no luck with Gracie?

51:05.216 --> 51:09.118
No. Give me two.

51:09.120 --> 51:11.519
"I'll fight the saloon
from the Hawaii to Hoboken,

51:11.521 --> 51:13.688
I'll kick it as long
as I have a foot.

51:13.690 --> 51:15.790
I'll punch it as
long as I have a fist.

51:15.792 --> 51:17.825
I'll butt
it as long as I have a head.

51:17.827 --> 51:19.694
I'll bite it as long
as I have a tooth ."

51:19.696 --> 51:23.232
Stratton, there's some old
Indian here to post your bail.

51:23.234 --> 51:25.535
Joe's grandfather he says.

51:43.787 --> 51:45.755
Hi, Gracie.

51:52.562 --> 51:54.731
I came to apologize.

51:59.602 --> 52:02.570
Would you let me in so we
can talk like civilized people?

52:02.572 --> 52:05.109
Oh why start now?

52:07.244 --> 52:11.581
Gracie, I'm sorry. Now
would you please let me in?

52:25.296 --> 52:26.962
What about the money?

52:26.964 --> 52:29.630
I'm sure you're quite willing
to share my bank account

52:29.632 --> 52:32.935
I don't want
your goddamned money.

52:32.937 --> 52:35.737
Even now you still
think it's about the money?

52:35.739 --> 52:37.774
How are you going
to make a living up here?

52:38.175 --> 52:41.278
You going to
marry some simpleton rancher?

52:43.014 --> 52:45.883
Let's face it
Gracie, you need me.

52:47.584 --> 52:50.921
I need you
like a hole in my head.

52:51.222 --> 52:54.689
I would rather starve
to death than spend another

52:54.691 --> 52:56.758
night in your bed
wondering how many ditsy

52:56.760 --> 52:58.293
actresses you
made it with that day.

52:58.295 --> 52:59.827
That only happened once!

52:59.829 --> 53:03.065
Oh, should I name them?
Let's see, Susie, Caroline

53:03.067 --> 53:04.565
Just stop.

53:04.567 --> 53:06.703
Stop. You listen to me.

53:07.138 --> 53:10.272
You can't leave
me, I won't allow it.

53:11.541 --> 53:12.540
Who the hell are you?

53:15.046 --> 53:19.016
Stop it! Stratton
stop it, he's my husband!

53:26.490 --> 53:28.257
We're getting a divorce, and I

53:28.259 --> 53:29.659
What?

54:18.641 --> 54:21.178
Stratton...

54:30.387 --> 54:32.389
Gracie.

54:33.324 --> 54:35.690
How you doing Joe?

54:35.692 --> 54:38.963
Better than some apparently.

54:40.164 --> 54:42.632
He won't even talk to me, huh?

54:44.935 --> 54:47.471
Well he's pretty angry.

54:48.239 --> 54:51.008
What about you, Joe,
are you angry at me too?

54:52.143 --> 54:54.378
It's none of my business.

54:56.779 --> 54:58.180
Hey, why don't
you come up to camp

54:58.182 --> 55:00.817
before you go
and have some coffee. Huh?

55:15.065 --> 55:17.032
Sorry you
came all the way up here,

55:17.034 --> 55:20.371
but Stratton's pretty stubborn.

55:21.071 --> 55:23.272
I thought you come to see me.

55:25.042 --> 55:27.309
Oh you're wonderful Flying Bear,

55:27.311 --> 55:29.077
you can always
make me feel better.

55:29.079 --> 55:31.313
I thought we were
gonna have a chess game.

55:31.315 --> 55:34.082
Well maybe you could come to my
house and we could play there.

55:34.084 --> 55:36.618
She already asked
me to come to her house,

55:36.620 --> 55:37.920
Stratton should know better than

55:37.922 --> 55:40.022
to leave me
alone with his woman.

55:40.024 --> 55:42.224
Grandpa! You
should be ashamed of yourself!

55:42.226 --> 55:43.992
Actually I was going to invite
all three of you to

55:43.994 --> 55:45.394
my house tomorrow
to watch some films.

55:45.396 --> 55:47.129
You can show
movies at your house?

55:47.131 --> 55:49.464
Yeah, I have a western
and a Felix the Cat short.

55:49.466 --> 55:52.034
You have Felix
the Cat at your house?

55:52.036 --> 55:53.468
You've seen Felix the Cat?

55:53.470 --> 55:55.306
He's the number one fan!

56:02.213 --> 56:04.448
Please convince
Stratton to come tomorrow night.

56:05.649 --> 56:07.418
I'll do my best.

56:08.785 --> 56:09.817
Bye Joe.

56:09.819 --> 56:11.721
See you Gracie.

56:20.631 --> 56:24.201
Welcome to the
Gracie Loren picture show.

56:30.773 --> 56:32.474
Hi Stratton.

56:32.476 --> 56:33.877
Gracie.

56:38.983 --> 56:41.218
Hey, where'd you
get the projector from?

56:41.619 --> 56:44.088
Collected
under the philanderers tax

56:44.888 --> 56:46.857
never mind.

56:47.658 --> 56:49.226
Oh, I made popcorn.

57:24.028 --> 57:25.562
Hi Gracie.

57:26.563 --> 57:28.299
What are you doing here?

57:29.300 --> 57:31.700
I was driving by and I uh

57:31.702 --> 57:33.203
Driving by?

57:34.905 --> 57:37.141
Well anyway, I'm here now.

57:38.309 --> 57:40.344
I see your friend's here again.

57:42.446 --> 57:45.080
Maybe we
could shake hands, make up.

57:45.082 --> 57:47.518
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

57:48.052 --> 57:50.387
Just
let me introduce myself around.

57:51.522 --> 57:55.159
My God! It's like
a wild west show in here!

57:55.526 --> 57:57.928
Cowboys and
Indians and the whole bit.

57:59.430 --> 58:02.230
I don't
believe we've officially met,

58:02.232 --> 58:04.535
my
name is Michael Giovanni.

58:24.688 --> 58:28.125
So Stratton, ever fought a duel?

58:28.992 --> 58:32.194
You do have a pair of pearl
handled six shooters don't ya?

58:32.196 --> 58:34.498
Michael, we're
trying to watch the movie.

59:12.669 --> 59:15.906
You okay?

59:25.382 --> 59:28.452
Don't you think he'd look
good in a white cowboy hat?

59:29.086 --> 59:31.422
Coming in to save all
the maidens in distress?

59:43.167 --> 59:44.766
Stratton where are you going?

59:44.768 --> 59:47.571
Wait! Stratton please don't go!

59:50.641 --> 59:53.241
Damn it Michael, I
want you out of my house!

59:53.243 --> 59:55.377
Not my fault
the cowboy can't take a joke.

59:55.379 --> 59:57.512
I guess your
hearing ain't so good,

59:57.514 --> 59:59.414
Gracie said she
wanted you out of her house!

59:59.416 --> 01:00:03.120
Alright, alright. I'm going.

01:00:13.197 --> 01:00:15.532
We better go get
Stratton he's pretty drunk.

01:01:36.014 --> 01:01:37.447
Stratton I'm sorry.

01:01:49.961 --> 01:01:51.461
Come here.

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:11.081
Sometimes
Stratton, I look at you

01:02:11.748 --> 01:02:14.384
and I see someone else.

01:02:16.119 --> 01:02:18.322
From another time,

01:02:20.157 --> 01:02:22.793
its

sheriff in these here parts?

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:38.735
Shut up!

01:03:39.569 --> 01:03:42.537
Quit squirming
and tell me who I'm talking to.

01:03:42.539 --> 01:03:44.506
My name is Michael Giovanni.

01:03:44.508 --> 01:03:46.176
Italian name?

01:03:47.177 --> 01:03:48.946
Yes sir.

01:03:49.413 --> 01:03:51.082
You don't look Italian.

01:03:51.715 --> 01:03:53.916
My family is
from Northern Italy.

01:03:53.918 --> 01:03:55.652
Gandy dancer?

01:03:56.154 --> 01:03:57.485
I beg your pardon?

01:03:57.487 --> 01:03:59.523
Do you work on the railroad?

01:03:59.857 --> 01:04:01.891
The railroad? No.

01:04:01.893 --> 01:04:04.194
Uh, I'm from California.

01:04:04.862 --> 01:04:06.697
That figures.

01:04:07.597 --> 01:04:10.467
So, what can I do for you?

01:04:11.568 --> 01:04:14.136
Well, I have
some information about an

01:04:14.138 --> 01:04:15.907
illegal liquor distillery.

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:29.352
Alright, we're
burning daylight. Let's go.

01:04:51.475 --> 01:04:52.609
What are you doing?

01:04:53.844 --> 01:04:55.111
Tom's supposed to pick up
another load this afternoon.

01:04:55.113 --> 01:04:57.081
He just did a run yesterday.

01:04:57.481 --> 01:04:59.483
Can you give me hand with this?

01:05:01.886 --> 01:05:04.088
Don't you
think we have enough money?

01:05:04.654 --> 01:05:05.957
What do you mean?

01:05:07.091 --> 01:05:09.459
I mean, do we really need
to do another run so soon?

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.063
Going soft on me?

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:16.333
We already got caught
once, I just think it's risky.

01:05:17.068 --> 01:05:18.568
You worry too much.

01:05:19.237 --> 01:05:20.938
Ah.

01:05:35.352 --> 01:05:37.454
Damn it!

01:05:41.458 --> 01:05:43.558
Stratton, why don't
we just go back to camp.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.462
Let's just wait a little longer.

01:05:55.539 --> 01:05:57.841
If he's not here by
now, he isn't coming.

01:06:01.812 --> 01:06:04.414
Well then
we'll do it by ourselves.

01:06:05.615 --> 01:06:09.086
Who was it that said,
we don't do runs anymore?

01:06:09.954 --> 01:06:12.089
I'll see
you in the morning then.

01:06:21.899 --> 01:06:24.501
You're a fool you know that?

01:06:44.188 --> 01:06:45.822
Where's Stratton?

01:06:46.823 --> 01:06:49.260
He's making
the deliveries himself.

01:06:49.826 --> 01:06:51.963
I thought you hired a runner.

01:06:52.997 --> 01:06:54.495
He didn't show.

01:07:20.091 --> 01:07:23.292
Civilization and
society rests on morals.

01:07:23.294 --> 01:07:25.327
Morals rest on religion.

01:07:25.329 --> 01:07:27.029
Religion rests on the Bible and

01:07:27.031 --> 01:07:29.365
on faith in God
and in Jesus Christ!

01:07:29.367 --> 01:07:32.201
The Bible doesn't condemn
any man because of his wealth.

01:07:32.203 --> 01:07:34.769
The Bible says that the man that
don't provide for his family is

01:07:34.771 --> 01:07:36.372
worst than an infidel!

01:07:36.374 --> 01:07:39.540
America needs a title
wave of the old time religion!

01:07:39.542 --> 01:07:41.377
According to our
standard of gold and

01:07:41.379 --> 01:07:42.810
Boys how we doing?

01:07:42.812 --> 01:07:44.115
Good.

01:07:45.482 --> 01:07:47.450
Carson, come
over here for a minute.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:51.854
What do you know Harris?

01:07:51.856 --> 01:07:53.289
Damn sight
more than you.

01:07:54.859 --> 01:07:57.026
How's my boy from Kentucky been?

01:07:57.028 --> 01:07:58.127
Good, good.

01:07:58.129 --> 01:08:00.031
That's great!
No problems at all?

01:08:00.563 --> 01:08:02.033
Nary a one.

01:08:03.334 --> 01:08:06.434
Hey listen,
take, take that hat off and let

01:08:06.436 --> 01:08:08.172
me get a look at you.

01:08:10.573 --> 01:08:13.175
You know the
thing I like about you is:

01:08:13.177 --> 01:08:15.110
you've always
been good at math.

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.246
Now I don't know about that!

01:08:17.247 --> 01:08:19.081
No listen, you are, you are.

01:08:19.082 --> 01:08:22.084
For example, I mean if
one of these crates went

01:08:22.086 --> 01:08:25.988
out of here with
15 jars in it rather than 20,

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:28.859
you'd, you'd
notice that wouldn't you?

01:08:29.591 --> 01:08:31.926
Yeah, yeah.
Of course I would.

01:08:31.929 --> 01:08:33.661
Yeah, sure you would.

01:08:37.033 --> 01:08:39.701
That you will
never rest until this of

01:08:39.703 --> 01:08:42.438
God hating, Christ
hating, whiskey soaked,

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:44.038
Sabbath breaking

01:08:44.041 --> 01:08:47.675
blaspheming, infidel,
bootlegging old world is bound

01:08:47.676 --> 01:08:51.481
to the cross of Jesus Christ
by the golden chains of love!

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:39.063
Oh, thank
God you're okay.

01:09:40.231 --> 01:09:41.899
I was so worried.

01:09:43.767 --> 01:09:46.001
You don't have to worry anymore.

01:09:46.002 --> 01:09:48.604
Joe and I
decided that's our last run.

01:09:49.606 --> 01:09:51.408
I'm glad.

01:09:52.009 --> 01:09:54.609
Did you sell all of it though?

01:09:55.913 --> 01:09:58.149
Don't worry
there's plenty extra.

01:09:59.216 --> 01:10:01.749
So are you
going to retire to some

01:10:01.751 --> 01:10:04.186
exotic destination now?

01:10:04.188 --> 01:10:08.625
Well I thought
I might move to Californy,

01:10:09.427 --> 01:10:11.060
make a life in motion pictures.

01:10:11.062 --> 01:10:13.797
Oh, my dreams have come true.

01:10:19.503 --> 01:10:21.172
It's funny.

01:10:22.106 --> 01:10:24.875
Now that I have some money,

01:10:25.309 --> 01:10:28.012
I don't have
a clue what to do with it.

01:10:30.847 --> 01:10:33.714
I'm starting
to understand the old ways that

01:10:33.716 --> 01:10:35.920
Flying Bear talks about.

01:10:38.122 --> 01:10:40.824
Living here is true freedom.

01:10:45.196 --> 01:10:47.062
What do you say to
shacking up with a mountain man?

01:10:47.064 --> 01:10:49.366
Isn't that what I'm doing?

01:10:49.934 --> 01:10:51.902
I guess it is.

01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:54.338

I can't keep
moving. We just gotta stop.

We can't stop.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.019
I can't see how a few minutes
is gonna make a difference.

01:15:39.089 --> 01:15:40.722
I said move!

01:17:04.308 --> 01:17:06.176

01:17:23.727 --> 01:17:25.195
Where did they go!

01:17:26.296 --> 01:17:28.865
Don, hold her here.

01:17:28.867 --> 01:17:30.332
Robby, you come with me.

01:17:30.334 --> 01:17:32.503
And Don if you
see them, shoot them on sight!

01:17:37.841 --> 01:17:39.574
I'm going to relieve myself.

01:17:39.576 --> 01:17:40.775
Here.

01:17:40.777 --> 01:17:42.246
No, I don't
want it. I don't want it.

01:17:42.679 --> 01:17:45.082
I'd probably end
up shooting myself.

01:17:45.582 --> 01:17:46.683
Alright then.

01:17:52.589 --> 01:17:55.223
I don't want to do this.

01:17:55.225 --> 01:17:58.059
I just want to go home.

01:17:58.061 --> 01:18:01.431

01:18:04.501 --> 01:18:07.671

can still work it out?

01:18:08.973 --> 01:18:10.774
Of course we can.
