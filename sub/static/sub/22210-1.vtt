00:02.001 --> 00:03.368
<i>Last season, on</i> The Flash...

00:03.462 --> 00:04.452
Iris West...

00:06.173 --> 00:08.039
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

00:08.383 --> 00:09.669
I'm not Caitlin anymore.

00:10.219 --> 00:12.085
- You're not Killer Frost?
- I'm not.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.423
I'm something else.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.801
And I need to figure out what that is
on my own.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.224
Cecile Horton, I love you.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.098
<i>That's definitely not a breach.</i>

00:25.359 --> 00:27.021
<i>The Speed Force is unbalanced.</i>

00:27.236 --> 00:29.353
- It's a Speed Force prison.
- Without a prisoner.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.233
- It goes unstable.
- How do we stop this?

00:34.743 --> 00:36.405
<i>My name is Iris West,</i>

00:36.495 --> 00:39.078
<i>and I was supposed to marry
the fastest man alive,</i>

00:39.164 --> 00:40.496
<i>but six months ago, he left.</i>

00:41.833 --> 00:44.496
<i>Barry, it's time.</i>

00:45.504 --> 00:46.494
Barry.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.378
This isn't fair.

00:48.674 --> 00:50.711
We're supposed to have our happy ending.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.252
I'm ready to be Iris West-Allen.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.635
And you always will be,

00:55.639 --> 00:57.551
but you have to
keep living your life, okay?

00:58.100 --> 00:59.841
Keep running. For me.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.223
Promise me you'll run, Iris.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.388
I promise.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.859
<i>I promised him I'd run.</i>

01:15.576 --> 01:17.693
<i>So that's what I've been doing
these last six months.</i>

01:18.036 --> 01:20.278
<i>Running as fast as I can.</i>

01:29.339 --> 01:30.580
I can't find her, Cisco.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.964
Boy, I gotta work out more.
She's really stepped up her game.

01:35.387 --> 01:37.549
Then let's turn up ours.
I don't have eyes on her.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.134
<i>- Iris?</i>
- Copy, I'm on it.

01:39.933 --> 01:40.923
Looking.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.426
- Got her.
<i>- And?</i>

01:43.854 --> 01:44.844
Duck!

01:44.938 --> 01:46.145
I don't see no duck.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.140
Peekaboo.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.359
Your only warning, boys.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.144
Stay back.

01:53.780 --> 01:54.861
She meant the other "duck."

01:54.948 --> 01:57.656
Yeah, I cannot believe you actually
thought she meant a "duck" duck.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.192
Where is she, Iris?

02:00.287 --> 02:01.869
She's headed for the Keystone Bridge.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.742
If she gets out of this city,
we're gonna lose her for good.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.368
You guys have to stop her now.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.786
I'm gonna catch her this time.

02:07.753 --> 02:08.869
I hate teleporters.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.231
Three... Three.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.602
<i>She jumps to every third rooftop.</i>

02:34.196 --> 02:36.062
Cisco, she's gonna jump
to the Broome Tower.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.317
- When she lands, stop her.
<i>- On it.</i>

02:37.407 --> 02:38.818
- Dad, meet them at the bottom.
<i>- Copy.</i>

02:38.909 --> 02:39.899
- Wally...
<i>- I know what to do.</i>

02:45.207 --> 02:46.197
Come on.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.624
Peekabooyah!

03:00.222 --> 03:01.303
Dead bang, fellas.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.013
Look at that.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.723
We got her.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.147
I'm so proud of us.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.778
That was a good hustle out there,
Team Vibe.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.196
It's Team Kid Flash, but thank you.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.528
Okay, not your finest hour, gentlemen.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.238
What are you looking at me for?
I was the one that put her down.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.745
And Wally and I helped him out
with the assist. Classic maneuver.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.542
Yeah. It actually went
exactly as we planned it.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.664
Exactly as we planned it.

03:32.754 --> 03:33.790
You don't believe us? Ask Joe.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.917
Joe, go ahead and tell her how
this went exactly as we planned.

03:36.091 --> 03:38.333
- Peekaboo fell right into our trap.
- I'm not doing that.

03:38.468 --> 03:41.302
And we aren't exactly
catching bad guys at our old rate.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.595
One out of every three metas

03:42.681 --> 03:44.638
that we fought in the last six months
has escaped.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.975
Temporarily, yes,
but Team Kid Flash is on the case.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.518
Son, I love you,

03:50.188 --> 03:51.850
but ain't nobody feeling Team Kid Flash.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.226
It's like too many syllables.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.353
Okay, guys. Maybe a little less
fooling around

03:55.444 --> 03:56.980
and a little more
taking things seriously.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.107
It's up to us
to protect this city, right?

03:59.865 --> 04:01.026
Because there is no one else.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.947
Wally, why don't you
go to the Speed Lab?

04:06.329 --> 04:08.286
I've programmed a new
training simulation for you.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.363
It should only take four hours.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.079
Four... What? No. What about
family dinner tonight? I'm...

04:12.878 --> 04:14.210
You know what? Training sounds amazing.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.495
Okay.

04:16.882 --> 04:17.872
See you at home, boss.

04:20.552 --> 04:24.011
Cisco, you want to share
what you're thinking?

04:24.765 --> 04:27.348
I'm thinking it'd be a lot better off
if we weren't one man down.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.641
<i>I only have a couple more boxes
to bring over.</i>

04:36.943 --> 04:40.277
We have no more room
in the garage or the basement.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.856
Right. Or we could just get rid of
some more of your stuff.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.023
Like what?

04:44.159 --> 04:47.903
Like, babe, do you really need
all the smelly old records in there?

04:48.371 --> 04:50.237
- Oh, Cecile.
- Records?

04:50.499 --> 04:53.788
You mean my vintage jazz LP collection

04:53.877 --> 04:57.621
that I painstakingly and carefully
collected over the last 30 years?

04:58.089 --> 04:59.830
- Really?
- Those are my loves, babe.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.963
They're going in the coffin with me
when I die.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.921
Okay, maybe we could bury them now,

05:06.014 --> 05:08.051
and you can just join them
at a later date.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.173
<i>Oh, you gotjokes.</i>

05:09.267 --> 05:10.803
- Oh, wow.
- You're lucky I gave you a key,

05:10.894 --> 05:12.760
because I'm starting to rethink
this whole move-in thing.

05:12.854 --> 05:13.935
No, you're not.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.517
- No, I'm not.
- No, you're not.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.264
Because you love me.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.399
Why don't I go make us some coffee?

05:24.032 --> 05:25.068
Obvious.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.651
<i>Okay, so...</i>

05:29.579 --> 05:31.866
Ever since Julian
moved back to London,

05:32.374 --> 05:35.617
they have been short-staffed
in the crime lab at CCPD.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.203
And I've been stalling Singh
with this whole story

05:38.296 --> 05:40.663
of Barry being on a sabbatical
in the Czech Republic.

05:40.799 --> 05:43.007
And they want to hire someone
to replace him.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.049
Yeah, they should. They need the help.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.597
- Barry's not coming back, so...
- You don't know that.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.340
Yes, I do.

05:52.394 --> 05:53.384
Sweetheart,

05:55.730 --> 05:58.598
I'm very proud of you
for taking the lead

05:58.692 --> 06:00.354
with Wally and Cisco at S.T.A.R Labs.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.273
I let you have your space

06:03.363 --> 06:06.697
so that you'd have time
to deal with what happened.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.904
Dad, I'm fine. Okay?

06:09.494 --> 06:11.486
I'm not. We lost him, Iris.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.825
My son. Your everything.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.198
Dad, what do you want me to do?

06:16.585 --> 06:18.201
Curl up in a ball and cry all day?

06:18.753 --> 06:19.743
I can't do that.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.372
Barry told me to be strong.
I'm being strong.

06:23.842 --> 06:26.255
When H.R. died, we had a funeral.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.089
We spoke about his life.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.715
Maybe we should do
the same thing for Barry.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.175
Give us all permission to grieve.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.763
And what are we going to bury, Dad?

06:37.480 --> 06:38.846
That empty suit in the lab?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.320
You know what? Thank Cecile for dinner.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.567
I'm going to get going, okay?

07:27.238 --> 07:28.354
Wally? Cisco?

07:28.782 --> 07:29.772
We're up.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.749
Guys, what are we looking at?

07:41.127 --> 07:42.117
Holy Ronin.

07:49.761 --> 07:50.751
It's a samurai.

07:51.262 --> 07:52.548
Anybody speak Japanese?

07:55.934 --> 07:57.926
Tell me he did not just speak Japanese.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.264
I can do things.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.557
<i>The Flash.</i>

08:05.276 --> 08:06.687
Yeah. You're looking at him, pal.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.687
<i>You're not the Flash.
You're not the best.</i>

08:10.448 --> 08:12.440
<i>Bring me the Flash.</i>

08:12.534 --> 08:13.524
I'm sensing an "or else."

08:14.119 --> 08:16.486
<i>Or else, your city falls.</i>

08:17.372 --> 08:18.488
<i>The Flash ain't coming.</i>

08:19.124 --> 08:21.912
Furthermore, Mifune, we're gonna
need you to sheath that sword

08:22.002 --> 08:23.368
<i>before somebody gets hurt,</i>

08:23.920 --> 08:25.377
<i>somebody like you, for instance,</i>

08:25.880 --> 08:27.621
'cause you're up against
some bad <i>hombres.</i>

08:28.508 --> 08:30.465
Now, what do you think
you're gonna do against us

08:31.928 --> 08:33.009
with a sword?

08:45.608 --> 08:46.644
You guys okay?

08:48.987 --> 08:50.603
The hell kind of sword is that?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.071
<i>You have one day.</i>

08:52.490 --> 08:54.402
<i>If the Flash does not face me,</i>

08:54.743 --> 08:56.700
<i>Central City dies.</i>

09:06.421 --> 09:08.663
<i>The Flash hasn't been seen
in almost six months,</i>

09:08.757 --> 09:12.091
<i>leaving us to speculate what can
save us from this newest threat.</i>

09:12.510 --> 09:14.627
There are other superheroes
in this town.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.046
Yeah, and your boy Kurosawa over there

09:17.140 --> 09:20.258
blew us away like rag dolls,
performing his reverse Excalibur.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.018
We haven't faced
anything like this before.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.891
Why do you think
he only wanted the Flash?

09:25.440 --> 09:26.601
He said he wants to fight the best.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.557
He's threatening to destroy the city.
Do we think he can he do it?

09:28.651 --> 09:29.641
I say yes.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.853
- Then he has to fight the Flash.
- Who isn't here.

09:34.699 --> 09:35.689
What if he was?

09:37.243 --> 09:38.324
Iris, you said it yourself.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.028
Just us trying to keep the city safe,
we're barely getting it done.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.822
And this guy, he's no joke.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.208
If we don't offer up the Flash,
there's gonna be serious damage.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.248
People are gonna die,
and that's gonna be on us.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.331
We need to bring Barry back.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.124
Cisco, we can't.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.468
If Barry comes out,
the Speed Force prison goes...

09:56.638 --> 09:57.628
Becomes unstable.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.304
Could destroy the city, the whole world.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.173
Which is exactly what
we're trying to prevent.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.303
What if I can solve that?

10:02.894 --> 10:04.931
- In the next 24 hours?
- Yes!

10:05.271 --> 10:06.887
Guys, I've been working on this.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.142
For how long?

10:10.026 --> 10:11.233
Since the night he left.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.147
- Cisco...
- I've had help.

10:13.488 --> 10:17.528
I've consulted with Harry and Tina
and Tracy and Felicity and Curtis,

10:17.784 --> 10:19.650
and I'm pretty sure
I've figured out a way

10:19.828 --> 10:22.411
to stabilize the Speed Force prison
and free Barry

10:22.705 --> 10:24.867
without unleashing another
lightning storm on the city.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.666
I just need a couple more things.

10:34.676 --> 10:35.962
- Maybe we should.
<i>- No.</i>

10:36.511 --> 10:39.094
You've been working on this
for how long and you never told us?

10:39.180 --> 10:41.092
I didn't want to say anything
until I was certain.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.890
Are you certain that the Speed Force
won't take Wally in his place?

10:44.060 --> 10:45.346
Are you certain that you can even

10:45.436 --> 10:48.053
close it before it rips Central City
in two?

10:48.773 --> 10:50.765
Are you certain that
Barry is even still alive?

10:50.942 --> 10:52.308
He's got to be.

10:54.529 --> 10:55.815
Iris, you of all people,

10:57.073 --> 10:58.359
how can you not be in on this?

10:59.534 --> 11:00.820
Because Barry is gone.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.662
That is the only thing
any of us can be certain about.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.496
Now, let's do what we can do to come up

11:06.583 --> 11:08.074
with a plan to take out this samurai.

11:08.710 --> 11:09.700
<i>Okay?</i>

11:11.880 --> 11:12.870
Okay?

11:13.256 --> 11:14.246
Okay.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.583
I'm gonna need some coffee.

11:28.771 --> 11:29.761
Hello.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.606
My, what a selection.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.228
You got any recommendations?

11:35.236 --> 11:36.943
Yeah. Drink somewhere else.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.237
What can I get you?

11:38.448 --> 11:40.815
Let's go with something sweet

11:41.159 --> 11:44.243
but deceptively strong with lots of ice.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.538
Shirley Temple coming right up.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.701
What is a nice girl
with two doctorates and a PhD

11:51.794 --> 11:53.751
doing in a rat's nest like this one?

11:54.464 --> 11:56.376
Working. How'd you find me?

11:56.466 --> 11:59.425
I'm great with computers, and I have
my own satellite. You do the math.

11:59.802 --> 12:00.792
You vibed me.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.378
I vibed you. Yes.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.674
You're looking a lot less frosty
than the last time I saw you.

12:07.018 --> 12:09.260
You said you weren't her,
but you weren't Caitlin either.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.017
It's just me, Cisco. I'm just Caitlin.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.349
How'd you do it?

12:16.569 --> 12:17.559
What do you want?

12:17.695 --> 12:20.062
Well, a stiffer drink for starters.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.111
If you're back to normal,
I have to know.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.442
<i>Why didn't you come back to us?</i>

12:26.913 --> 12:28.745
Okay, I get it. That's fine.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.700
I'm not gonna make you answer that,
but we really could've used you.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.788
Barry's still stuck in the Speed Force?

12:34.671 --> 12:35.661
You knew about that?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.877
I'm gonna get him out,
but I need your help.

12:44.806 --> 12:45.796
Everything okay?

12:47.433 --> 12:48.423
Everything's fine.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.134
Yeah, everything's great, pal.
Do you mind?

12:50.228 --> 12:51.218
I'm talking to the lady.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.769
I'm sure there's someone else
you can find in here

12:52.855 --> 12:54.642
to commiserate with
over poor life choices.

13:00.738 --> 13:01.728
Thank you.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.281
Look, I figured out how to save Barry,

13:06.077 --> 13:07.318
but I can't do it without you.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.786
You see that samurai
that showed up today?

13:09.872 --> 13:11.033
Yes.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.162
He's threatening to blow up the city,
and we need Barry to stop him.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.210
So help us out, please,

13:18.089 --> 13:19.079
Caitlin?

13:20.633 --> 13:21.840
My shift's over in an hour.

13:23.886 --> 13:24.922
Girl, I got time.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.134
Oh... This is good.

13:28.683 --> 13:29.924
Is there anything you can't do?

13:30.226 --> 13:31.433
Move on, apparently.

13:34.731 --> 13:35.721
Hang tight.

13:35.940 --> 13:36.976
You're coming home, buddy.

13:41.029 --> 13:43.567
Hey, Cisco, can you pull up
the Mockingbird satellite?

13:44.032 --> 13:45.398
We're tracking down this samurai.

13:47.410 --> 13:48.400
Cisco?

13:50.079 --> 13:51.069
Wally?

14:04.886 --> 14:06.673
Mr. West. Mr. West.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.428
So what are we doing out here, Cisco?

14:08.556 --> 14:09.922
It seemed an appropriate venue.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.348
We've had good luck here before.

14:11.476 --> 14:14.344
- Why do we need good luck?
- Because we're bringing Barry back.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.855
- Cisco, Iris said...
- I know what Iris said, Joe.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.232
I also know Barry said everyone would
look to me after he was gone.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.310
So look to me.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.070
The four of us? We can do this.

14:26.449 --> 14:27.860
What do you mean, "the four of us"?

14:28.242 --> 14:29.232
Hi, Joe.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.616
It's okay. She's Caitlin again.
Our Caitlin.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.868
<i>She's here to help us. So?</i>

14:37.085 --> 14:38.075
What do you say?

14:40.713 --> 14:41.749
You better be right.

14:43.758 --> 14:44.748
I am.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.637
Joe, I know that I can never make up

14:50.723 --> 14:53.431
for the things that I did
to you, to Cecile.

14:54.644 --> 14:55.634
I just hope...

14:56.354 --> 14:58.095
I just hope that one day
you can forgive me.

15:01.609 --> 15:02.599
Come here.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.358
Let's bring everybody home today, okay?

15:07.490 --> 15:08.480
You got it.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.905
So how are we going to bring Barry back
without blowing a hole in the world?

15:11.994 --> 15:14.657
Ha! In the spirit
of bringing back old friends,

15:15.498 --> 15:18.536
may I present the Speed Force bazooka.

15:18.668 --> 15:19.704
Ah.

15:19.794 --> 15:22.832
I've made a few slight modifications,
as Captain Solo would say.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.255
Caitlin and I spent all of last night
working out some kinks,

15:25.341 --> 15:26.502
fine-tuning the Quark Sphere.

15:26.717 --> 15:27.833
<i>- The what?
- The Quark Sphere.</i>

15:28.136 --> 15:29.843
Filled with Barry's
unique genetic marker

15:29.929 --> 15:31.795
and programmed to track his specific DNA

15:31.889 --> 15:33.801
using the electrical current
of the Speed Force.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.803
Once we track Barry and we pull him out,

15:35.893 --> 15:37.850
the Quark Sphere
will trick the Speed Force

15:37.937 --> 15:39.348
- into thinking he's still there.
<i>- Hey, Wally,</i>

15:39.939 --> 15:41.430
can you put that on the center pylon?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.609
- Ready.
- Let's bring our boy home.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.240
Quark Matter
scanning electrical current.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.336
Triangulating Quark Matter
on his location.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.297
I've got a lock on something.

16:07.842 --> 16:08.832
It's him.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.168
It's him!

16:11.637 --> 16:12.627
Now, Cisco!

17:26.796 --> 17:28.537
I can't believe you did this
behind my back.

17:28.631 --> 17:31.169
- You would've tried to stop us.
- Because it was a waste of time!

17:31.509 --> 17:33.375
I don't understand.
This should have worked.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.669
Or you could have killed us all.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.719
I don't know, Iris.
I think we were pretty close.

17:38.266 --> 17:41.850
I'm sorry, "we"? Where have you been
the last six months again?

17:41.936 --> 17:43.052
She was only trying to help.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.436
Look, guys, we need to concentrate

17:45.523 --> 17:47.560
on stopping this samurai
who's trying to destroy the city,

17:47.650 --> 17:50.267
- not on Barry.
- Dude, what is your deal?

17:51.112 --> 17:52.478
It's like you don't even want him back.

17:52.655 --> 17:53.691
Hey, hey, hey!

17:55.658 --> 17:57.820
Cecile, can I call you back in a minute?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.151
<i>We're in the middle of something here.</i>

18:00.580 --> 18:01.570
What?

18:02.290 --> 18:04.907
State police picked him up
on the 112 outside Ivy City.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.037
That's 300 miles away.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.870
Yeah, one of the cops
was a Keystone vet, recognized him.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.579
I knew it would work. I knew it.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.919
You should prepare yourselves.

18:24.645 --> 18:25.635
Barry.

18:31.819 --> 18:32.809
<i>Barry.</i>

18:41.829 --> 18:43.161
Nora shouldn't be here.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.581
Your mom isn't here, Barry. It's...

18:48.210 --> 18:49.200
It's me, Iris.

18:50.671 --> 18:51.661
<i>You're home.</i>

18:53.174 --> 18:55.837
Your Honor, I'm innocent.
I didn't do this.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.133
I didn't kill anyone.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.468
Can you hear the stars? Singing.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.177
Rhyming. Chiming. Timing.
Every hour, every minute.

19:03.601 --> 19:06.844
You said the city was safe,
that there was no residual danger.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.054
But that's not true.
What really happened that night?

19:09.190 --> 19:12.308
The city is safe. You saved it.
You saved us all.

19:19.325 --> 19:23.069
Stars melting like ice cream.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.573
Dream. Gleam.

19:26.207 --> 19:29.666
Nothing seems... Nora shouldn't be here.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.914
I'm guessing this isn't just shock?

19:32.254 --> 19:34.041
<i>Shock results from a drop
in blood pressure.</i>

19:34.131 --> 19:35.497
This is neurological.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.174
It's a whole new way
of looking at physics.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.636
It will change the way
that we think about everything.

19:42.348 --> 19:46.092
From a single atom to an entire galaxy.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.771
The stars are so loud.
Loud. Cloud. Proud.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.026
Dad and I are both okay.

19:56.404 --> 19:57.565
We're going to be fine.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.738
I'm just not sure I'm like you, Oliver.

20:02.493 --> 20:04.450
We need to get him back
to S.T.A.R Labs now.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.211
<i>What's the diagnosis?</i>

20:15.798 --> 20:17.209
Does he have brain damage or something?

20:17.299 --> 20:18.915
He's actually scary healthy.

20:19.093 --> 20:22.086
His neural transmitters are functioning
at five times the normal speed.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.050
- Then what's wrong?
- I have two theories.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.723
One is that he's suffering
from a form of schizophasia.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.301
That's where you assign
the wrong definitions to words.

20:29.812 --> 20:30.893
So from his perspective,

20:30.980 --> 20:32.642
all that nonsense he's saying
makes sense.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.730
It's too bad we don't have a translator.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.852
No, but we can make one.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.562
<i>If his brain's schizophastic,</i>

20:40.656 --> 20:42.067
and these symbols
represent different words,

20:42.158 --> 20:43.569
he could be sending us a message.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.818
And we just need the right algorithm
to decrypt it.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.454
You said you had two theories.
What's the other one?

20:50.708 --> 20:53.166
We know that the Speed Force
exists beyond space and time.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.368
To us, Barry was only in there
for six months,

20:55.463 --> 20:58.297
but to him,
it could have been 10,000 years.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.548
All that time in isolation,
it could have caused dementia.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.255
That may be all of him that's left.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.183
So how do we find out which one it is?

21:11.896 --> 21:13.853
I can decrease the sedative,
wake him up.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.773
I think I've got
the perfect song for that.

21:21.572 --> 21:22.904
Are you sure this is appropriate?

21:23.032 --> 21:25.866
Yeah, it's a good luck charm.
I mean, it worked before.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.244
Last time, he was in a coma,
not a pantemporal extradimension.

21:29.455 --> 21:32.072
Well, then waking up to Gaga
shouldn't seem too freaky.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.408
Hey, Barry.

21:35.169 --> 21:37.661
Hey, it's me.

21:38.839 --> 21:39.829
Cisco,

21:40.549 --> 21:44.919
a.k.a. Vibe, a.k.a. your BFF. Yeah.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.220
Hey, buddy.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.383
Hey.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.854
While you were gone,
I made you a new suit.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.603
Do you want to take it out for a spin?

22:00.110 --> 22:01.442
The stars are raining.

22:02.988 --> 22:06.322
Draining. Paining. Too soon.

22:06.992 --> 22:10.076
I think maybe later. No, thank you.

22:10.538 --> 22:14.031
I'm not hungry.
He didn't do those things.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.162
He didn't hurt my mom.
I was there that night.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.789
There was a man. Plan.

22:19.922 --> 22:20.912
No plan.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.425
We're going to need more diapers.

22:27.596 --> 22:28.586
Diapers.

22:29.265 --> 22:30.301
You keep drawing, buddy.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.723
You keep drawing.
I'm going to figure this out.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.929
- Caitlin?
- I don't know.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.355
Guys, can I get the room for a second?

22:50.661 --> 22:51.651
Barry.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.788
I don't know if you can hear me,

22:59.420 --> 23:01.286
<i>or if you're trying to send us
a message somehow.</i>

23:02.381 --> 23:03.872
Hey, I did what you told me to.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.757
I kept running. I kept moving forward.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.887
Because I knew that
if I stopped to look back,

23:10.973 --> 23:13.511
then I would remember
that you weren't behind me anymore.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.686
And it's been so hard.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.516
And when Cisco said
that he could bring you back,

23:23.611 --> 23:24.897
you know, I didn't know what to think.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.573
What if it didn't work?
What if you were dead?

23:31.327 --> 23:34.365
I mean, I thought it would be like
losing you all over again.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.879
I never imagined this, though.

23:48.719 --> 23:51.211
I don't know what I would do
if this is all that's left of you,

23:52.890 --> 23:56.884
if this is all that's left of
the amazing man that I know and love.

24:00.022 --> 24:01.263
Please come back to me.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.235
Tell me you're still my Barry.

24:13.369 --> 24:14.359
Guys.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.085
Barry. Barry, stop!

24:26.090 --> 24:27.171
Bring him to the Pipeline.

24:27.675 --> 24:28.665
He's too fast.

24:35.766 --> 24:36.927
Expecting someone else?

24:39.269 --> 24:41.682
We need to get him in a containment cell
before he does that again.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.016
Samurai's back.

24:47.444 --> 24:49.276
More like Samurai Jackass.

24:49.363 --> 24:50.649
No, that's a rough draft.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.275
It hasn't even been a full day yet.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.365
He said he'll level the city
if we didn't bring him the Flash.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.444
Well, let's give him what he asked for.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.491
You wanted me.

25:06.797 --> 25:07.787
Here I am.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.352
<i>You're not the Flash.</i>

25:30.863 --> 25:31.853
Wally.

25:39.329 --> 25:42.197
<i>If I don't get the real Flash
by nightfall,</i>

25:42.708 --> 25:44.119
<i>the city goes down.</i>

25:58.057 --> 25:59.389
How long till I can get back out there?

25:59.558 --> 26:01.265
Wally, he sliced
right through your fibula.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.684
If you weren't a speedster,
I'd be amputating your leg right now.

26:04.354 --> 26:05.515
Okay. How long?

26:07.649 --> 26:08.730
Four to five hours.

26:09.943 --> 26:11.184
We don't have that kind of time.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.268
You know what? I'm fine.

26:13.447 --> 26:15.188
Son, son, son.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.774
You've done everything you can do.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.150
Relax.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.035
- Any luck?
- No, not yet.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.162
The computer keeps telling me
it's random gibberish.

26:27.461 --> 26:29.544
- Maybe it is.
- No, it's not.

26:29.755 --> 26:31.621
Barry's trying to send us a message,
I know it.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.665
I mean, he spent all this time
in the Speed Force.

26:33.759 --> 26:37.048
Maybe now he knows the answers
to life, the universe, and everything.

26:37.304 --> 26:40.547
So you think all this crazy writing
is Barry's way of telling us 42?

26:41.725 --> 26:42.886
Yes, exactly.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.017
Have I mentioned
how much I miss having you around?

26:53.904 --> 26:55.361
I'm gonna keep working on this.

26:55.614 --> 26:56.821
Unless you have any ideas.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.693
Nope. It's all Greek to me.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.906
Great Caesar's ghost.

27:04.581 --> 27:07.824
This analysis is based on
a monoalphabetic substitution cipher,

27:08.001 --> 27:09.663
but what if it's polyalphabetic?

27:09.753 --> 27:11.244
What if it's like Greek?

27:11.547 --> 27:13.413
Like the symbols are a unique alphabet.

27:16.176 --> 27:17.383
Excelsior.

27:18.303 --> 27:19.794
- What is it?
- Cisco figured it out.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.174
He figured out
how to crack Barry's code.

27:21.265 --> 27:22.301
You did? What does it say?

27:22.641 --> 27:24.223
Hold on one sec. It's loading.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.550
Come on.

27:26.103 --> 27:27.139
Loading, loading, loading.

27:27.229 --> 27:28.390
And it says...

27:30.399 --> 27:32.140
"This house is bitchin'."

27:34.736 --> 27:35.943
"This house is bitchin'"?

27:37.072 --> 27:38.153
That doesn't sound like Barry.

27:38.448 --> 27:39.438
No.

27:39.533 --> 27:40.944
No. No, it doesn't.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.359
It's because it's not.

27:57.759 --> 27:58.749
Whoa.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.423
Don't tell me you have Frankenstein
under there.

28:02.556 --> 28:03.592
It's Barry's new suit.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.141
Right now, I'm having trouble
seeing it as anything

28:07.227 --> 28:08.388
other than a waste of time.

28:08.937 --> 28:09.973
- Cisco...
- I know.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.230
I should have listened to you.

28:13.901 --> 28:15.813
Barry was never trying
to communicate with us.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.352
But I believed in him.

28:19.573 --> 28:20.563
I really did.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.617
Sometimes, I feel like, if I believe
in something hard enough,

28:24.703 --> 28:25.910
that'll make it real.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.410
You know what the worst part is?

28:32.252 --> 28:33.493
I didn't do this to save the city.

28:36.590 --> 28:40.630
I did it because it gave me an excuse
to bring him back.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.054
I did it because I miss my friend.

29:15.712 --> 29:16.702
Much better.

29:17.547 --> 29:18.628
You said it yourself.

29:19.633 --> 29:21.090
She goes looking for danger.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.604
I thought cleaning him up
would make me feel better, but...

29:44.533 --> 29:45.523
Yeah.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.194
The more he looks like himself,

29:49.288 --> 29:50.870
<i>the more it reminds you how lost he is.</i>

29:52.499 --> 29:54.616
<i>You have to believe
that things can get better.</i>

29:55.335 --> 29:58.169
There is an answer for every question.

30:00.549 --> 30:02.165
I don't think I know
how to anymore, Dad.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.259
I know that feeling.
I was struggling with it, too.

30:06.763 --> 30:08.846
But I figured it out.

30:11.685 --> 30:12.675
How?

30:12.936 --> 30:13.926
Church.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.227
You haven't gone to church
since I was a kid.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.307
I know.

30:19.693 --> 30:22.481
Cecile suggested it.
Thought it would help.

30:23.697 --> 30:25.689
But I swear,

30:26.700 --> 30:28.612
one of the priest's homilies...

30:29.119 --> 30:30.109
It was like...

30:30.537 --> 30:31.778
It was like he wrote it for me.

30:33.123 --> 30:36.912
"Strength means nothing without faith."

30:39.671 --> 30:41.458
And I started realizing

30:42.966 --> 30:47.210
that my strength
didn't stop me from thinking

30:47.596 --> 30:49.258
I'd lost you to Savitar

30:49.431 --> 30:52.014
or that we'd never see Barry again.

30:53.977 --> 30:57.436
Cecile reminded me to have faith,

30:59.775 --> 31:01.061
and I believed.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.189
And here you two are.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.157
You've got strength, baby girl.

31:14.498 --> 31:15.659
You just need a little faith.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.412
<i>Joe, Samurai's 24 hours are up.</i>

31:18.668 --> 31:19.658
Got to go.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.566
Come get me.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.608
<i>I don't see the Flash.</i>

31:52.869 --> 31:54.861
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to make do with us.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.464
Iris! Hold your fire.

32:08.677 --> 32:09.667
You want the Flash?

32:10.470 --> 32:11.460
Take me.

32:11.972 --> 32:12.962
<i>Why?</i>

32:13.557 --> 32:14.673
Because he'll come for me.

32:15.559 --> 32:18.427
<i>And how do you know this?</i>

32:20.397 --> 32:21.387
I believe.

32:25.652 --> 32:26.813
Iris!

32:34.327 --> 32:36.239
Hey, Samurai's got Iris.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.536
She gave herself up to him.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.075
- What?
- Why would she do that?

32:42.502 --> 32:43.663
<i>How do we get her back?</i>

32:48.341 --> 32:51.049
Barry, Iris is in trouble.
She needs your help.

32:51.136 --> 32:54.174
I doubt restraint is how
you got to be the man you are today.

32:54.264 --> 32:57.302
Play way, no way, highway, byway!

32:57.851 --> 32:59.763
Please, son. Please.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.269
<i>I wanna help you with all this,
and I will.</i>

33:02.355 --> 33:04.813
But right now, she needs our help,
or she's gonna die.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.353
Barry, did you hear what I said?
Iris is gonna die.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.115
Barry's gone.

33:24.503 --> 33:25.584
You know what else is gone?

33:27.380 --> 33:28.416
The new suit.

33:30.383 --> 33:31.373
What's happening?

33:32.219 --> 33:33.300
The Flash is back.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.224
Do you see how fast he's running?

33:40.644 --> 33:42.180
I've never gone that fast.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.344
No one has.

33:54.908 --> 33:56.740
Where is this samurai taking Iris?

33:56.826 --> 33:58.033
They're already way past Danville

33:58.119 --> 34:00.202
and the only thing out there is
the flat lands and...

34:00.872 --> 34:01.862
And what?

34:38.659 --> 34:39.992
Come on, Barry. Catch her.

35:26.916 --> 35:30.409
<i>Flash. Welcome home.</i>

35:32.130 --> 35:33.120
<i>Barry.</i>

35:38.303 --> 35:39.293
You came back to me.

35:42.724 --> 35:43.714
Always.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.738
Pupils are equally reactive to light,

35:59.824 --> 36:02.032
and your vitals are amazing.
You're in perfect health,

36:02.118 --> 36:03.154
even for you.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.532
I'd like a urine sample
just to confirm,

36:05.664 --> 36:06.871
<i>but everything looks great.</i>

36:07.207 --> 36:08.323
Man, you love urine.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.575
You love the testing of urine.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.252
The testing of the urine...
You know what I meant.

36:13.546 --> 36:14.832
Why do you have to ruin science?

36:15.298 --> 36:16.379
It's good to have you back.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.165
Right back at you.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.001
Good to have you back.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.587
- How you feeling?
- I feel great.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.302
Yeah, I feel incredible.
I don't know. It feels like...

36:27.352 --> 36:28.433
I've been reborn.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.561
Well, okay, speedy Jesus.

36:31.981 --> 36:34.314
Seriously, though, I mean,
it hurts me to admit it,

36:34.401 --> 36:36.609
but you may be
the fastest speedster ever.

36:37.737 --> 36:39.729
I mean, you were in the Speed Force
for six months.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.314
Maybe you were soaking up its energy.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.023
Maybe.

36:43.535 --> 36:44.992
How was everything while I was gone?

36:45.078 --> 36:46.910
Oh, yeah. It was really cool.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.329
Team Kid Flash had
everything under control, so...

36:49.416 --> 36:50.657
That's not our name.

36:51.459 --> 36:54.202
But still we have some mysteries
left to solve.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.955
Like our flying samurai robot.

36:57.507 --> 36:58.964
Android samurai...

36:59.467 --> 37:00.503
Samuroid.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.585
Oh-oh, we back, baby!

37:03.263 --> 37:05.926
Yeah, someone created this,
and it must be for a reason.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.634
Does the phrase,
"This house is bitchin',"

37:09.936 --> 37:11.097
mean anything to you?

37:11.730 --> 37:12.720
No.

37:13.732 --> 37:14.722
Should it?

37:15.734 --> 37:18.317
No. Just know that when you were
in your <i>Beautiful Mind</i> phase,

37:18.403 --> 37:20.360
you were talking straight up nonsense.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.233
I don't remember any of that.

37:22.949 --> 37:25.032
Last thing I remember was going
into the Speed Force with my mom

37:25.118 --> 37:26.609
and then saving Iris.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.990
So how'd you know Iris was in trouble?

37:31.958 --> 37:32.948
I don't know.

37:34.335 --> 37:35.325
<i>Mmm.</i>

37:36.337 --> 37:37.373
Well, thanks for bringing me home.

37:39.174 --> 37:40.210
You're very welcome.

37:42.051 --> 37:45.135
Hey, Cisco.
Thanks for believing when I couldn't.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.097
- See you tomorrow, boss.
- Yeah.

37:54.189 --> 37:55.930
I know we left some
questions unanswered,

37:56.024 --> 37:57.640
but I have to know.

37:59.486 --> 38:00.693
Are we gonna see you tomorrow?

38:01.404 --> 38:02.986
Yeah, you will.

38:06.159 --> 38:07.275
We back, baby.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.239
We back, baby.

38:19.255 --> 38:21.167
- Where have you been?
- Doesn't matter.

38:21.674 --> 38:22.664
Really?

38:23.843 --> 38:25.050
Tell Amunet I'm out.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.087
You wanna quit, Snow?
It doesn't work that way.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.007
You do what Amunet says
for as long as she tells you.

38:31.601 --> 38:34.594
Not anymore. Now, leave me alone.

38:36.231 --> 38:37.847
You don't tell us what to do.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.441
Don't make me frosty.

38:45.031 --> 38:47.023
You wouldn't like me when I'm frosty.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.781
What's the matter? Brain freeze?

38:52.205 --> 38:54.367
Touch my hand again,
and I'll freeze yours off,

38:54.791 --> 38:56.202
maybe some other parts, too.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.333
Tell Amunet I'm done.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.004
Don't let your beer get warm.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.341
Time to have some fun.

39:16.688 --> 39:17.678
Not yet.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.357
Oh, no. No, no, no.

39:22.443 --> 39:23.433
No, no, no.

39:28.783 --> 39:29.773
Not again.

39:36.666 --> 39:39.204
Are you tired?
Do you wanna get some sleep?

39:39.711 --> 39:42.294
No, I feel like
I've been asleep for months.

39:45.967 --> 39:49.256
I... I couldn't bring myself
to sleep in our bed alone.

39:53.725 --> 39:54.886
I couldn't even look at that.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.228
It's been really hard, Barry.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.523
Hey, I'm back.

40:04.277 --> 40:06.234
And I'm never going anywhere ever again.

40:07.864 --> 40:08.980
I tried to keep going,

40:10.742 --> 40:12.699
to keep fighting,
to keep running like you said.

40:12.785 --> 40:13.775
You did.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.404
You kept everyone together.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.915
I'm so proud of you, okay?

40:21.836 --> 40:23.372
Look, it sounds funny,

40:24.839 --> 40:26.205
but maybe this was a blessing.

40:27.050 --> 40:29.167
You being gone for six months
was a blessing?

40:29.510 --> 40:33.675
I just... I can't tell you
how I feel, Iris. It's like...

40:34.807 --> 40:38.926
Everything that was wrong in my life,
the pain of my past, my mistakes,

40:39.020 --> 40:40.352
it's all just washed away,

40:40.438 --> 40:42.521
and all I see is you and us

40:43.232 --> 40:44.439
and our future together.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.442
Iris, it's gonna be great.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.779
Central City needs the Flash.

40:58.873 --> 41:00.330
I'll be right back, I promise.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.469
The samurai served its purpose.

41:22.605 --> 41:24.688
<i>As in 12th century
feudal Japan,</i>

41:25.274 --> 41:27.357
<i>a time when the military class
was powerful,</i>

41:28.403 --> 41:31.737
<i>their execution methodical
like ours.</i>

41:34.826 --> 41:38.160
Well, it worked.
The Flash is back in Central City.

41:38.621 --> 41:40.908
<i>It appears things are going
as planned.</i>

41:42.917 --> 41:44.249
As if there were any doubt.

41:50.883 --> 41:51.999
What's our next step?

41:54.929 --> 41:56.295
I'm thinking.
