01:27.379 --> 01:30.423
NARRATOR: Here we are,
floating peacefully in the sky.

01:30.549 --> 01:33.176
Metro City, the jewel in the crown.

01:33.719 --> 01:37.263
Beautiful, isn't it? But how did we get here?

01:37.723 --> 01:42.226
A century ago, the founders of Metro City,
seeing our world was changing,

01:42.311 --> 01:45.813
took Mount Sofia and lifted it
out of the Earth and into the sky

01:46.482 --> 01:50.401
to be an oasis, a floating paradise.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.155
We don't really know
what happens these days

01:54.239 --> 01:57.366
on the strange and mysterious Surface
we left behind.

01:57.451 --> 02:03.289
But life in Metro City is better than ever,
thanks to our friends, the robots.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.417
Robots do our shopping.

02:07.211 --> 02:10.630
They cook for us. They serve our meals.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.007
They take good care of us.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.593
They even do the really important things

02:15.677 --> 02:18.721
like reminding us to call Mom
on her birthday.

02:19.264 --> 02:22.308
Whether it's raising our children,
building our buildings,

02:22.392 --> 02:26.145
taking care of our city
or making sure we're all fit and healthy,

02:26.230 --> 02:29.106
for these guys, no job is too big

02:30.859 --> 02:32.527
or too small.

02:32.653 --> 02:37.782
Plus, robots do a lot of the things that
frankly we just don't want to do anymore.

02:38.617 --> 02:39.659
Oh, no!

02:39.743 --> 02:42.745
NARRATOR: Don't worry, folks,
that street will get clean.

02:42.955 --> 02:46.415
The best and brightest of them get picked
for the more exciting tasks.

02:46.959 --> 02:50.503
This lucky guy is starting the first day
at his new job.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.255
(CRASH)

02:53.549 --> 02:57.969
And it's all thanks to this man, Dr. Tenma,

02:58.053 --> 03:01.806
head of the Ministry of Science
and father of modern robotics.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.517
Thanks to him and
the incredible innovations he introduced...

03:04.601 --> 03:06.727
Hey, Toby, isn't that your dad?

03:07.062 --> 03:08.354
- It sure is.
- Hush!

03:08.939 --> 03:13.192
NARRATOR: Our friends, the robots, help us.
Thousands are created every day,

03:13.277 --> 03:16.195
and thousands are disposed of
in the great unending cycle

03:16.280 --> 03:19.240
that sustains life in our great city.

03:19.324 --> 03:22.994
Thanks for everything, guys.
May you rust in peace.

03:23.287 --> 03:24.287
(LAUGHING)

03:24.580 --> 03:26.789
Okay, students. Ready for a pop quiz?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.666
- What?
- SPORTY BOY: Oh, no.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.876
Begin.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.338
- SPORTY BOY: Oh, man.
- I am so busted.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.549
(ALL GRUMBLING)

03:46.351 --> 03:48.185
Yes, Toby. Is there a problem?

03:48.270 --> 03:51.147
There's no problem.
I'm just finished, and I'd like to leave.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.481
Finished?

03:52.816 --> 03:55.651
For rocket science,
it wasn't exactly rocket science.

03:56.153 --> 03:59.155
I don't suppose there's much point
in you staying.

04:00.282 --> 04:01.908
- Good luck, guys.
- GIRL: Jeez.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.581
Just like his father.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.335
Hello, Master Toby.
Did you have a good day at...

04:12.419 --> 04:14.086
Think fast, Orrin.

04:14.671 --> 04:18.007
Thank you, Master Toby.
Very good throw, by the way.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.637
- Hello, Son.
- Hello, sir.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.180
- How was school?
- Oh, great.

04:24.514 --> 04:28.476
Moustachio dropped a pop quiz on us,
but I'm pretty sure I got 100%.

04:28.560 --> 04:32.897
That's good, Son, very good,
but I don't want you to become complacent.

04:33.357 --> 04:37.193
It's important to keep studying.
Onward and upward, Toby.

04:37.486 --> 04:38.611
Sure, Dad.

04:40.781 --> 04:44.283
I'm aware I said I'd take you
to that symposium on quantum mechanics,

04:44.368 --> 04:46.661
but I'm afraid
I have to take a rain check again.

04:46.787 --> 04:50.873
- But you promised.
- I'm sorry, Toby, but it's unavoidable.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.876
President Stone has brought forward
the unveiling of the Peacekeeper.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.545
The Peacekeeper?
You've got to be kidding me!

04:56.713 --> 04:59.215
I never kid. Goodbye, Son.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.427
The Peacekeeper, huh?

05:03.637 --> 05:07.431
Hey, Orrin, change of plan.
Take me to the Ministry of Science.

05:07.641 --> 05:12.144
I'm sorry, Master Toby, but your father
gave me strict instructions to...

05:12.729 --> 05:16.565
Stop that! What are you doing back there?
Hey! Hey!

05:17.401 --> 05:19.485
Next stop, Ministry of Science.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.155
(HORNS HONKING)

05:29.079 --> 05:31.414
You ready to blow me away today, Tenma?

05:31.623 --> 05:34.166
To make my hair stand up,
to knock my socks off?

05:34.376 --> 05:38.421
- Yes, yes, metaphorically speaking.
- STONE: Well, that's the spirit.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.549
Dr. Elefun is an esteemed colleague
of mine, Mr. President.

05:41.633 --> 05:45.594
He may be resistant to having his discovery
used for military purposes.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.555
Well, you leave Dr. Elefun to me.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.223
- TOBY: Dad!
- SOLDIER 1: Hold that kid!

05:49.725 --> 05:52.268
What are you doing here?
I gave Orrin specific instructions to...

05:52.436 --> 05:53.394
(THUMPING)

05:53.478 --> 05:55.229
Ow, ow.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.190
I wanted to see the demonstration.
You're always talking

05:58.275 --> 06:00.109
- about the Peacekeeper and...
- Really, Toby.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.069
- Your boy?
- Yes, sir.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.612
Well, let him tag along.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.905
Releasing potential threat.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.949
It'll be good for him, educational.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.284
Yes, sir.

06:08.869 --> 06:12.747
So, you're interested in robots, son?
Robot weapons?

06:12.831 --> 06:16.333
Absolutely, though I'm sure you'll agree
the latest D-Class Interceptor

06:16.418 --> 06:19.587
underlying deployment-to-target system
is quite old-fashioned.

06:19.671 --> 06:20.921
(SIGHS)

06:21.381 --> 06:23.132
Nobody likes a smarty-pants, kid.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.509
Take this boy to a safe place
and keep him there.

06:25.594 --> 06:26.552
What the...

06:26.636 --> 06:28.471
- Dad!
- I think it's for the best, Toby.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.139
But you said I could see the Peacekeeper.

06:30.223 --> 06:34.143
You still can,
on tonight's news with everybody else.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.353
ELEFUN: Ladies and gentlemen,

06:36.730 --> 06:40.399
allow me to present Blue Core energy.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.069
- Wow.
- ELEFUN: Blue Core energy,

06:43.612 --> 06:46.072
a new self-sustaining power source

06:46.156 --> 06:50.367
much stronger than nuclear energy
and infinitely cleaner.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.870
The raw materials came from space.

06:53.163 --> 06:58.375
A fragment of a star millions of light-years
away that no longer even exists.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.170
This is now all that's left of it.

07:01.379 --> 07:05.591
Properly harnessed,
this small sphere could transform

07:05.675 --> 07:10.387
not only Metro City,
but life for those on the Surface, as well.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.435
Imagine cleaning up Earth's water.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.604
Imagine bringing back the forests.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.482
Imagine overcoming the effects
of centuries of pollution.

07:21.775 --> 07:25.319
I know he's a bit of a dreamer,
but he's a brilliant scientist.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.697
He's a dangerous idiot
who happens to have a high IQ.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.617
Unfortunately, there's no such thing
as a free lunch.

07:31.827 --> 07:35.121
When we extracted the positive blue energy
from the fragment,

07:35.205 --> 07:40.167
we were left with this highly unstable
by-product, negative red energy.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.377
STONE: I like that one.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.463
Women voters are partial
to the color red, you know.

07:44.548 --> 07:47.925
Until we discover how to
safely dispose of it... What...

07:48.135 --> 07:49.677
What are you doing? Stop!

07:50.554 --> 07:54.056
- Keep the cores apart or you'll kill us all!
- Do as he says.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.811
This is outrageous!
What are you intending to do with it?

07:58.895 --> 08:01.897
(CHUCKLES) I'm gonna give
the people of this city

08:01.982 --> 08:04.150
- a reason to re-elect me.
- How?

08:04.359 --> 08:08.028
The only way you can, Doctor.
I'm gonna kick some butt.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.910
- This is so unfair.
- Now cool off, hotshot.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.662
Please don't leave me in here, sir!

08:16.746 --> 08:19.123
I can't stand small places.
Anywhere but here!

08:19.541 --> 08:23.460
Jeez, kid. You're like 13 years old.
It's time you grew a backbone.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.965
Thanks for the life lesson,
and thank you for this.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.718
ELEFUN: As one friend to another,
don't do this, Tenma.

08:30.844 --> 08:34.346
Come on, Elefun. You know as well as I do,
without military funding

08:34.472 --> 08:38.058
all of our research, including yours,
would grind to a halt.

08:38.684 --> 08:39.768
Start it up.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.872
I told President Stone,
"You gotta bring out the big guns."

09:00.081 --> 09:01.498
"Onward and upward, Toby."

09:02.209 --> 09:03.500
Load the Blue Core.

09:11.468 --> 09:15.763
Hold on. This Blue Core,
it's all sweetness and light, right?

09:15.972 --> 09:18.557
I mean, "Save the dolphins,"
"Give peace a chance," and so forth?

09:18.808 --> 09:20.976
It's pure positive energy.

09:21.686 --> 09:26.148
Call me a dreamer, but I think we'll get a bit
more bang for our buck using the red one.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.483
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

09:27.609 --> 09:28.817
Oh, you're not joking.

09:28.902 --> 09:33.781
Sir, we're not putting something that
dangerous into something that dangerous.

09:33.865 --> 09:36.742
Listen, Tenma, I've got an election to win.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.954
I need my robot to be a fighter, not a lover.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.665
- Load the red one.
- I won't.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.251
Well, then I'll do it. Move over, sweetheart.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.585
- Hey!
- No!

09:48.797 --> 09:50.798
It's like a video game.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.015
Core loaded.

10:00.809 --> 10:01.850
Piece of cake.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.852
HECKLER: Activate weapon drones.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.361
DRONE: I hate this job.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.282
(EXCLAIMS)

10:16.366 --> 10:17.950
I gotta get a better look.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.786
SOLDIER 1: Time to check the classifieds.
SOLDIER 2: I hear you.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.713
STONE: It's using that drone against
the other drones. How's that possible?

10:30.797 --> 10:33.799
TENMA: It's called "adaptive technology."
It can absorb and control anything.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.509
STONE: Well, I may have
flunked out of college,

10:35.593 --> 10:37.386
but I was right about the Red Core.

10:37.512 --> 10:40.222
You scientists think
you're the only ones with the brains.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.019
Huh? Sir?

10:58.658 --> 11:01.327
Dad! Dad!

11:01.411 --> 11:03.537
- Toby!
- Dad!

11:03.621 --> 11:06.248
I can't open it! I can't open it!

11:07.042 --> 11:08.667
Help me, Dad! Help!

11:08.877 --> 11:10.127
- Toby!
- Dad!

11:10.587 --> 11:13.756
TENMA: It's going to be okay, Toby.
I'm going to get you out!

11:14.132 --> 11:17.009
Everything's going to be fine, I promise.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.101
Toby!

11:26.936 --> 11:28.270
(BEEPING)

11:32.233 --> 11:33.442
Fire now.

12:02.680 --> 12:06.141
Where's Toby? Where's my son?

12:08.353 --> 12:10.604
I'm so sorry, Tenma.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.116
Toby.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.451
(PANTING)

12:26.830 --> 12:28.330
It's all my fault.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.419
(BEEPING)

13:29.809 --> 13:30.809
(BABY CRYING)

13:30.894 --> 13:31.894
(CHILD LAUGHING)

14:07.263 --> 14:08.931
He hasn't eaten or slept for days.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.433
- I know.
- He's gone crazy, hasn't he?

14:11.935 --> 14:15.437
If you lose your son like that
and you don't go crazy,

14:15.730 --> 14:17.105
you're not a human being.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.274
Clear the lab.

14:35.875 --> 14:40.963
It looks just like him, doesn't it?
A perfect replica.

14:41.256 --> 14:44.508
Plus, I've uploaded all of Toby's memories.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.887
- It will think it is Toby.
- Don't expect too much, Tenma.

14:49.556 --> 14:53.141
It has the most advanced defense systems
ever created.

14:53.351 --> 14:54.893
I won't lose him again.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.688
Did you bring what I asked?

14:57.772 --> 15:00.148
I couldn't refuse a grieving father.

15:05.238 --> 15:09.116
The Core is unpredictable.
I can't guarantee what effect...

15:09.325 --> 15:12.077
It's gonna make it perfect! Perfect!

15:12.912 --> 15:14.329
Just like Toby was.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.439
Dad?

16:23.191 --> 16:24.399
Toby.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.864
Whoa. Whoa.

16:31.574 --> 16:32.616
Dad!

16:33.409 --> 16:35.077
Welcome back, Son.

16:35.620 --> 16:40.248
Thank you, Elefun.
I'm going to take it, him, home now.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.002
Quality time. Bonding. All the good things.

16:44.587 --> 16:45.837
Bye, Dr. Elefun.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.507
Bye, Toby.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.802
Incredible.

17:12.865 --> 17:13.990
Dad?

17:15.076 --> 17:16.367
(GASPS)

17:16.452 --> 17:19.954
Good morning, Son. How do you feel?

17:20.039 --> 17:25.210
Uh, kind of weird.
Have I been sick or something?

17:25.294 --> 17:29.297
No, you're fine, Toby. You're perfect.
You're wonderful.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.591
Oh, that's good, 'cause...

17:33.511 --> 17:34.803
(CRYING)

17:36.848 --> 17:39.558
Um, are you okay?

17:43.020 --> 17:44.146
(ORRIN SCREAMS)

17:44.313 --> 17:48.567
No. I must be malfunctioning.
Wires crossing, short-circuiting.

17:48.651 --> 17:51.236
It can't be you. You're...

17:52.655 --> 17:54.197
Oh, my gosh!

17:54.615 --> 17:56.199
You're... You're...

17:56.284 --> 17:57.659
Hey, Orrin, you okay?

17:57.827 --> 18:00.829
You're gonna be late for school.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.372
(CHUCKLING)

18:03.833 --> 18:09.379
Well, I must say,
it's very nice to see you again.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.507
Sit down, Toby. I wanna talk to you.

18:12.717 --> 18:15.469
- Sure, Dad.
- It's about school.

18:15.553 --> 18:18.346
I've decided
you shouldn't go anymore, Son.

18:18.681 --> 18:21.558
I'm gonna teach you at home myself.

18:21.726 --> 18:22.726
Sounds good to me.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.729
Hey, Orrin, looks like we're gonna be
hanging out together.

18:26.063 --> 18:32.152
Together? Well, that'll be very nice,
Master Toby.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.946
- Oh, dear.
- Please, Toby,

18:35.031 --> 18:37.866
- just let the robot do its thing.
- Sorry.

18:38.993 --> 18:42.996
Hey, if you're going to be home-schooling
me, what about the Ministry? Yourjob?

18:43.080 --> 18:46.750
My job now is to be your father.

18:46.834 --> 18:47.876
Huh.

18:48.002 --> 18:50.170
I am so freaked!

18:52.590 --> 18:54.508
Let's start you out with something familiar.

18:55.343 --> 18:58.053
Four-dimensional calculus.
It's your favorite.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.222
I guess it is.

19:00.306 --> 19:04.434
If sir wishes,
perhaps I could help Master Toby with...

19:05.061 --> 19:09.231
Oh, bad idea. Bad idea. I'm a robot.
What am I thinking?

Good. Good.

Bravo. Wonderful. Excellent, Toby.
First rate, Son. First rate.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.117

20:02.201 --> 20:04.661
Yes! You asked for it every night.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.289
That's not quite what I...

20:07.373 --> 20:11.167

- Whoa! Close.
- Way to go, Orrin. You're the man.

20:58.966 --> 21:03.595
Yes. You know, I haven't had
this much fun since, well, ever.

21:03.846 --> 21:05.055
Check this out.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.264
Oh!

I'm impressed.
Not knocked out, but impressed.

Oh!

Now, that is impressive, Master Toby!

What are you doing? I said to read
these books, not destroy them.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.475
(STUTTERING) I just wanted to
test da Vinci's theories.

21:50.685 --> 21:57.232
I um, perhaps encouraged Master Toby, sir.

22:01.529 --> 22:05.156
You should not be wearing that hat.

22:05.825 --> 22:10.370
A robot should not be wearing my son's...
Toby's hat.

22:18.963 --> 22:22.424
Dad, it's fine. I don't even like the hat.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.430
I think you should go to your room.

22:47.950 --> 22:49.784
I think I've made a terrible mistake.

I thought he would be like Toby,

Strange? Strange how?

22:58.961 --> 23:02.464
He's brilliant as Toby was, but different.

23:02.965 --> 23:06.551
Well, you can't expect him to
be a carbon copy. Give him time, Tenma.

23:06.635 --> 23:07.969
You don't understand.

23:08.971 --> 23:11.097
He was meant to replace Toby,

23:11.182 --> 23:15.852
but every time I look at him,
it just reminds me that Toby is gone

23:17.438 --> 23:19.230
and he's never coming back.

35:24.498 --> 35:26.207
Someone's in trouble?

Oh, no.

- It's a kid.

ZANE: We want robots, not kids,
you stupid garbage-eater.

36:08.959 --> 36:10.793
So, where are you from, non-robot?

36:11.169 --> 36:13.003
I'm from Metro City.

36:13.088 --> 36:16.882
(SARCASTICALLY) Metro City! Can you
believe it, guys? He's from Metro City,

36:16.967 --> 36:19.260
- and he's actually talking to me.
- Are you feeling okay?

36:19.427 --> 36:21.053
Oh, my gosh! He talked to me twice.

36:21.221 --> 36:24.890
Well, this is definitely going in my diary
as the most exciting day of my life.

36:24.975 --> 36:28.018
Okay, I get it.
You don't like people from Metro City.

36:28.270 --> 36:31.689
ZANE: Metro City.
Robots waiting on you hand and foot.

36:31.773 --> 36:34.400
I'd love to visit, just for one day.

36:34.985 --> 36:36.318
They wouldn't let you in.

They have a strict "No losers
from the Surface allowed" policy.

36:40.115 --> 36:41.782
Anyway, why would you want
to go someplace

36:41.867 --> 36:43.701
where people think you're garbage?

36:44.369 --> 36:46.120
I mean, look at this.

36:46.955 --> 36:48.956
Can you believe someone
just threw it away?

36:49.040 --> 36:50.791
Nu-uh! Finders keepers.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.961

I don't know yet. Looking for something,
I guess, somewhere.

36:59.426 --> 37:00.676
Did you run away?

37:00.969 --> 37:05.139
Not exactly.
They sort of suggested I find a new place,

37:05.682 --> 37:07.057
whatever that means.

37:07.142 --> 37:09.226
Dude, it means they kicked you out.

Uh, sorry. I'll pick it up.

Yes, please.

for me asking, but are you exempt

Well, that's not much of a name.

No, you want something

- Yeah, or the Annihilator.

It's modern, a little space-age. I love it.

39:27.323 --> 39:29.616
Thanks, guys. Well, I better get going.

39:29.826 --> 39:31.827
Show Astro the plan!

As you wish, comrade. This is Hamegg!

- Nice.
- The likes of him enslave our kind.

I know. I hate losing, too. You want proof

the more abused,

back on their feet.

what a nice-looking kid like that

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:34.005
is doing in a place like this.

That ain't no kid, folks.

01:00:36.008 --> 01:00:40.636
That's a robot from Metro City.

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:46.434
Get this, folks. Astro personally told me
he doesn't think much

He didn't say that.

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:57.695
He didn't say he was a robot, either.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:01:00.531
This is what we've all been waiting for,

01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:04.493
