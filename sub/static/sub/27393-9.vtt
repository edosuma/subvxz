WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:12.721
[Alexa] It was New Year's Eve
in my beautiful new room,

00:12.804 --> 00:13.805
and life was good.

00:14.264 --> 00:18.143
Three months ago, I could barely sleep
because I was waiting for my test results.

00:18.226 --> 00:20.895
Now I could barely sleep
because I was so excited

00:20.979 --> 00:23.231
for my sweet 16 party, and the year ahead.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.441
[knock on door]

00:24.816 --> 00:28.653
Hey! According to my checklist,
Taboo is in your closet.

00:28.903 --> 00:32.699
Ha-ha! Yeah, I can't wait
to rule game night! [chuckles]

00:33.908 --> 00:35.660
It is your New Year's tradition.

00:35.744 --> 00:39.164
Yeah, I do love to start
every New Year dominating. [chuckles]

00:39.247 --> 00:41.332
Put your clothes away!
Oh, that's crooked.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.625
Just warmin' up!

00:44.711 --> 00:46.463
She's crazy, but she's right.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.175
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:51.509 --> 00:52.761
live and in person,

00:53.178 --> 00:55.263
put your hands together for...

00:55.680 --> 00:58.183
the paycheck that gets me over
the $2,000 mark,

00:58.266 --> 01:01.227
-and gets me to London!
-Congratulations!

01:01.311 --> 01:02.520
-Oh, take our photo!
-Okay.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.148
[Alexa] Yass!

01:05.231 --> 01:06.733
Now one of the three of us.

01:07.901 --> 01:08.902
[camera clicks]

01:09.110 --> 01:10.111
[giggles]

01:10.195 --> 01:12.447
I'm so proud of you
for making this happen.

01:12.530 --> 01:13.865
I'm proud of me too.

01:13.948 --> 01:14.783
By the way,

01:14.866 --> 01:18.787
I'm going to want another photo of me
at school making my payment for the trip.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.080
On its due date.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.875
Are these the centerpieces for your party?

01:23.958 --> 01:25.877
Yeah, so I finally picked a theme...

01:26.461 --> 01:27.462
Mardi Gras!

01:27.545 --> 01:30.507
Yeah, it's fun and crazy
and a little too loud.

01:30.882 --> 01:31.716
Like me.

01:32.675 --> 01:34.594
And it's a celebration.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.847
You know, with you being healthy
and everything you've been through,

01:38.181 --> 01:39.724
you'll have a reason to party.

01:39.849 --> 01:41.392
[door knocking]

01:41.768 --> 01:44.062
Hey, Lex, can I borrow
your curl-defining cream?

01:44.145 --> 01:45.688
It's your curl-defining cream.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.234
I know. I'm really here to tell you
that I'm going

01:49.317 --> 01:52.445
to an epic New Year's Eve party.
[chuckles] Seniors only.

01:53.029 --> 01:54.948
Yeah, well, I think you're having
a senior moment

01:55.031 --> 01:57.659
because that's the hundredth time
you've told me.

01:58.576 --> 02:01.704
Enjoy whatever sad things sophomores do
on New Year's Eve.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.998
Well, you know what? In two years,

02:04.082 --> 02:07.544
we're going to be seniors and you're
going to be a sophomore again. Ha-ha.

02:10.797 --> 02:11.923
Yeah, it checks out.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.383
[audience laughing]

02:13.508 --> 02:15.176
Whatever. In two years,

02:15.260 --> 02:18.012
they'll still be talking about
how historic tonight was.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.430
Oh, and don't ask me

02:19.514 --> 02:22.267
about the awesome tradition
that happens at midnight

02:22.350 --> 02:23.977
'cause I'm sworn to senior secrecy.

02:24.352 --> 02:28.064
Everybody jumps in the freezing lake
with their clothes on! [laughs softly]

02:28.148 --> 02:29.774
[gasps] I've said too much.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.695
I can't wait to turn his room
into a yoga studio.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.573
Who cares about being a senior?

02:36.739 --> 02:39.325
With your birthday party
and my London trip,

02:39.534 --> 02:41.870
this is going to be the best year
of our lives.

02:41.953 --> 02:45.832
I'm gonna keep doing this whole
wanting stuff and going after it thing.

02:46.708 --> 02:47.584
From now on,

02:48.334 --> 02:49.419
I'm being bold.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.088
-Hmm. I like it.
-Yeah.

02:52.714 --> 02:57.177
No excuses, no fears, just me out there,
getting what I want.

02:58.803 --> 03:01.681
Right now, do you want to get to work?
Because you're gonna be late.

03:01.764 --> 03:04.392
Oh! I do! And boldly!

03:09.063 --> 03:12.066

[spritzing]

03:43.181 --> 03:45.975
I added a little extra whipped cream
to your mocha.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.978
[chuckles] Yeah, I'm being bold.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.271
I ordered black tea.

03:50.855 --> 03:51.731
So you did.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.237
Oh, nice! Extra whipped cream.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.614
[Barry whistling]

04:00.531 --> 04:03.368
Barry seems happy. That's unsettling.

04:04.035 --> 04:07.830
Yeah, well, it's time to take down
the Christmas decorations. [chuckles]

04:08.164 --> 04:11.042
Or, as he calls it,
"The most wonderful time of the year."

04:12.627 --> 04:14.671
Now I'm going to go de-holiday the roof.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.093
You're back! Oh, how was your Christmas?

04:20.176 --> 04:23.638
Great! My grandma and I got food poisoning
from old lettuce!

04:23.721 --> 04:25.515
So we had tons of time to catch up.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.893
Christmas in Chicago was fun too.

04:29.185 --> 04:31.646
Well, not as fun as throwing up
with your grandma,

04:31.729 --> 04:33.273
but you can't have it all.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.693
Hey, I'm getting your drinks right now.

04:37.819 --> 04:38.653
[thud]

04:39.946 --> 04:42.448
Did someone just push Frosty off the roof?

04:42.532 --> 04:44.492
Barry's taking the decorations down.

04:44.742 --> 04:45.994
Still murder in my book.

04:47.704 --> 04:48.538
Hmm.

04:49.539 --> 04:53.251
Did I mention
that Ryan gave me the sweetest gift?

04:53.501 --> 04:56.754
You mean the eight texts that said,
"Ryan gave me the sweetest gift"?

04:56.838 --> 04:58.464
What did you say to him
when you opened it?

04:58.548 --> 05:00.842
Well, I didn't see him
when he dropped it off,

05:00.925 --> 05:02.427
so I just texted him thank you.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.887
-Oh! What did he text back?
-Um...

05:06.097 --> 05:07.307
"Glad you like it."

05:08.266 --> 05:10.560
Then Katie replies, "I really do!"

05:10.643 --> 05:12.353
Ryan: "So happy to hear that."

05:12.437 --> 05:14.522
-"Happy you're happy to hear that."
-"Oh, good!"

05:14.605 --> 05:15.815
-"Good, good."
-"Cool!"

05:16.149 --> 05:18.234
- "Cool!"
-"Well, thanks again."

05:18.359 --> 05:19.360
"You're welcome again."

05:19.444 --> 05:22.905
And it goes on like that for another 50
or 60 texts until this morning

05:22.989 --> 05:25.283
when Katie sent: "Going to work."

05:26.075 --> 05:27.327
That's so romantic!

05:27.410 --> 05:31.164
Or just endless banter between two people
who really like each other,

05:31.247 --> 05:33.458
-but are too chicken to say how--
-I really like Ryan!

05:33.958 --> 05:36.044
-[Hannah] Really?
-[Alexa and Reagan] Finally!

05:36.169 --> 05:39.172
-[sighs] I guess I always have.
-[Hannah] Yeah!

05:39.464 --> 05:42.675
I just didn't want things to be weird
and ruin our friendship.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.678
So what's the next move?
Because these texts have to stop.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.639
I'm going to tell Ryan how I feel.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.018
Yeah, that's what a bold person does.

05:53.227 --> 05:56.522
I just need to find a quiet moment
between us when we get back to school.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.733
Are you crazy? It's New Year's Eve.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.069
Ask him to hang out
and do it during the fireworks.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.779
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.155
Okay, I'll text him.

06:04.405 --> 06:05.365
Or you can tell him now.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.324
Hey!

06:06.407 --> 06:07.992
-[Katie] Oh!
-[girls] Hey!

06:09.035 --> 06:09.952
Okay.

06:11.245 --> 06:14.415
Uh, I just thought I'd stop by
since Katie said she was working.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.417
Yeah, it's great to see you, Ryan.
[chuckles]

06:17.335 --> 06:18.753
It's good to see you.

06:19.295 --> 06:20.922
And the text chain lives on.

06:22.298 --> 06:25.385
Hey, what are you doing
for New Year's tonight?

06:25.760 --> 06:27.804
Want to hang with me
and watch the fireworks?

06:27.887 --> 06:30.056
Yes! I mean...
[chuckles] ...sure.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.975
I mean... [clicks tongue]
Yeah, I could probably make that work.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.145
[thud]

06:37.146 --> 06:39.357
We can watch the fireworks from the roof!

06:40.441 --> 06:41.567
I'm in! [chuckles]

06:42.110 --> 06:43.361
Me too! [giggles]

06:43.444 --> 06:46.072
So... who all's gonna be there?

06:46.280 --> 06:47.990
Like, you and me...

06:48.074 --> 06:50.118
[giggles] Yep, yep, you...

06:50.868 --> 06:53.079
-You and me...
-[both chuckle]

06:53.496 --> 06:55.123
...and Alexa and Hannah and Reagan.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.211
Oh, so it's a group thing!
Yeah, that's fine. [laughs]

07:00.962 --> 07:02.588
A group thing can be fine.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.048
Is it... is it safe up there?

07:04.132 --> 07:07.718
Good question 'cause I do not want
to fall through another roof.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.096
[audience laughing]

07:10.638 --> 07:11.848
Well, uh...

07:12.223 --> 07:13.433
I'll see you later then.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.350
Yeah.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.853
[Katie chuckles]

07:23.234 --> 07:24.569
That was amazing.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.612
But how dare you invite us!

07:26.696 --> 07:29.031
Wasn't it, so you could tell him
that you like him?

07:29.115 --> 07:30.366
And I'm going to.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.744
I just thought it'd be easier to be bold
with my friends around.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.956
But this means we have to figure out a way
to get the roof key from Barry.

07:37.039 --> 07:40.042
You know what? I'm just gonna tell him
I need the keys.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.252
[sighs] You are bold.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.212
Um...

07:43.504 --> 07:45.339
-I am a hard worker.
-No.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.383
-This is important.
-No.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.426
Hear me out.

07:48.509 --> 07:49.844
Fifty cents more an hour.

07:49.969 --> 07:53.639
No, I just wanna watch the fireworks
from the roof tonight with a few friends.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.725
-No.
-I'll be responsible.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.727
-Roof only. You can trust me.
-Fine.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.896
Huh? Ha! Yay!

07:59.979 --> 08:01.481
-[Katie chuckles]
-[keys jingle]

08:02.106 --> 08:06.986
Lock up first, no drinks, and make sure
it looks exactly like it does right now.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.615
Actually cleaner.
This place is disgusting.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.045
This is so exciting!

08:24.128 --> 08:27.089
I'm able to stay up until next year
playing games!

08:27.173 --> 08:29.175
-[Dave chuckles]
-Yup!

08:30.927 --> 08:34.430
-[Jack screeches in delight]
-Jack! You just got your cast off.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.807
Remember how you broke your arm
in the first place?

08:37.808 --> 08:39.602
Running around Dave and Laurie's couch.

08:40.811 --> 08:41.854
Oh!

08:41.938 --> 08:43.940
[audience laughing]

08:44.607 --> 08:46.067
[Lucas sighs] What a day!

08:46.150 --> 08:49.195
Or getting ready for "What a night!"
Ha-ha!

08:49.612 --> 08:51.697
Party prep started with an 8 a.m. run,

08:51.781 --> 08:54.158
followed by the gym, a haircut,

08:54.283 --> 08:56.452
and practiced my entrance
for the party tonight.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.955
[softly] Ooh! And it is good.

09:00.623 --> 09:04.252
Hey, Mom and Dad. Happy New Year's Eve.
How are you?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.754
This party is a big deal.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.423
-Seniors only.
-[both] We know!

09:11.050 --> 09:14.845
Look, I'm sorry I'm missing game night,
but staying in is an old person thing.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.724
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go
soak my feet and take a nap.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.354
[Jennifer]
All right, it's time to draw for teams.

09:23.479 --> 09:26.649
[Laurie] Well, listen, whoever is
my partner needs to look alive, okay?

09:26.732 --> 09:29.318
I'm not about to lose
my five-year winning streak.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.863
Oh, Dave. All right! We've got our teams!
[chuckles]

09:33.239 --> 09:34.824
Wait. I got Laurie!

09:34.907 --> 09:37.868
Oh, my first game night
and I'm partners with the champ!

09:37.952 --> 09:40.162
All right, Jack.
Come on, huddle up, all right?

09:40.329 --> 09:42.582
We've gotta talk Pictionary strategy.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.250
We should have a team handshake.

09:44.917 --> 09:45.751
Okay.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.296
[exhales]

09:51.924 --> 09:53.968
Already seeing that team chemistry.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.053
[audience laughing]

09:59.307 --> 10:03.561
[Alexa] This is so romantic.
New Year's Eve on a rooftop.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.271
[Hannah] Under the stars.

10:05.354 --> 10:08.232
Perfect view
of the abandoned tire factory.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.028
So, I figured out how to tell Ryan
I like him.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.989
I'm gonna walk right up to him and say...

10:16.115 --> 10:17.241
"Hey, Ryan.

10:17.325 --> 10:20.828
You know how you crack a peanut
and there's usually

10:20.911 --> 10:23.289
two nuts and not just one?"

10:24.707 --> 10:25.541
Oh, no.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.255
[Jack] Um... a watch?

10:33.799 --> 10:35.760
No. Um, a robot?

10:40.723 --> 10:41.974
-A robot watch?
-[buzzer rings]

10:42.058 --> 10:44.268
[both] That's a stop light.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.897
-Oh, yeah, I see it now. [giggles]
-[Laurie] Yeah!

10:49.565 --> 10:51.567
Well, you guys win. Again.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.319
[Dave] New champs!

10:53.402 --> 10:55.321
[both chortle]

10:55.404 --> 10:57.782
Look at me. I'm winning.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.950
I'm like the new Laurie.

11:00.826 --> 11:01.994
Oh, no, no, no.

11:02.161 --> 11:05.081
[chuckles] No, I'm still the Laurie.
We're not done.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.541
You still have to play Speak Out.

11:08.459 --> 11:09.877
Come here.
[clears throat] All right.

11:10.294 --> 11:12.755
This is important. So you've gotta listen,
all right?

11:12.838 --> 11:16.842
All you have to do
is figure out the words I'm trying to say.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.095
Wow, this is easy.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.180
I understood almost all of that.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.848
How many points do we get?

11:24.642 --> 11:26.686
-We're not playing yet.
-Oh!

11:26.811 --> 11:28.646
Okay. I'm gonna have to put
the mouthpiece in,

11:28.729 --> 11:30.648
and it's gonna be really hard
to understand me,

11:30.731 --> 11:33.567
so you've got to really focus
on the syllables and the emphasis.

11:33.651 --> 11:34.694
Got it, teammate.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.779
Let's do that after we win.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.365
Okay, here we go.

11:43.911 --> 11:46.372
All these years, I never realized
how beautiful your gums are.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.457
[audience laughing]

11:48.791 --> 11:50.793
[all laughing]

11:51.836 --> 11:56.006
[muffled]
A conference... for fans... of mannequins.

11:57.633 --> 12:00.511
[Jack laughs uncontrollably]

12:00.928 --> 12:04.932
[muffled]
A conference... for fans... of mannequins!

12:05.015 --> 12:06.600
[continues laughing]

12:06.684 --> 12:08.894
She's saying words,
but I can't understand them!

12:09.019 --> 12:11.021
[Jack continues laughing]

12:11.731 --> 12:14.984
Oh! Nothing like the sound
of your child's laughter.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.112
This is a disaster.

12:21.824 --> 12:22.825
Hey, guys.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.161
-[girls] Hey!
-[Katie] Hey! Welcome.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.789
New Year's Eve. Know what I'm saying?

12:29.123 --> 12:31.208
[chuckles] Be right back.

12:32.209 --> 12:35.546
Okay. What's the plan? You guys said
you'd come up with something.

12:35.629 --> 12:39.049
We're still working it out,
but just stall him with small talk.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.387
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.847
It's really incredible up here.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.724
-Oh, thanks.
-Yeah, great idea.

12:46.807 --> 12:49.518
I didn't even know Wired had a roof
until I started working here.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.436
Yeah.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.439
I'm gonna be right back. [giggles]

12:53.522 --> 12:56.400
Okay. Uh... what have you got?

12:56.484 --> 12:57.777
I think you're gonna like it.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.487
Picture this:

13:00.613 --> 13:01.655
[Alexa] You're cool.

13:01.739 --> 13:02.948
You're calm.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.868
You found something to stand on,
like a stage.

13:07.703 --> 13:11.040
You'll get everyone's attention
and confidently announce:

13:11.332 --> 13:13.375
"I have something important to say."

13:13.459 --> 13:15.461
[audience laughing]

13:15.711 --> 13:17.546
[Reagan] Then Hannah will play a song.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.215
[romantic music playing]

13:21.008 --> 13:23.803
That's your cue to look at Ryan
and tell him...

13:23.886 --> 13:25.805
[Alexa] I should have said this sooner,

13:25.888 --> 13:27.890
and I can't hold it back any longer!

13:29.642 --> 13:31.393
[Reagan] Then say it, Katie!

13:31.477 --> 13:33.103
[audience laughing]

13:33.229 --> 13:36.357
[Alexa] When we first met,
I thought you were really cool.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.236
Now that I've gotten to know you,
I know you're more than cool.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.071
You're one of a kind!

13:42.947 --> 13:44.949
[Reagan] Aww!

13:45.908 --> 13:47.827
You're one of a kind too.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.830
I guess that makes us two of a kind.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.957
[Alexa] Yeah, we are.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.252
That's why I have to tell you how I feel.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.628
I like you, Ryan.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.799
I really like you
with every bit of my heart!

14:09.515 --> 14:10.516
Pretty great, right?

14:10.683 --> 14:14.854
[gasps] It's perfect,
and I'm gonna make it happen, right now.

14:29.785 --> 14:30.619
[sighs]

14:33.038 --> 14:34.039
Excuse me.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.166
Attention, please.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.586
Got something to say.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.755
Listen up, people!

14:43.966 --> 14:46.594
Uh, I... I'm saying something now.
[chuckles]

14:47.303 --> 14:48.679
[Katie searching for words]

14:48.762 --> 14:53.100
Wow, my tongue is super, super dry.
[chuckles]

14:56.061 --> 14:57.313
[coughing]

14:59.982 --> 15:01.859
I'm okay. Just one sec.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.822
I know the Heimlich,
but I just ironed this.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.036
So, it's not a complete disaster.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.747
While you were coughing,
I noticed Ryan was looking at you.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.625
Yeah, yeah.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.923
[muffled]
Pugs... practice... jumping... rope.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.884
-Pugs practice jumping rope!
-[Dave] Woo!

15:27.259 --> 15:28.218
She's right!

15:28.385 --> 15:30.471
[muffled]
Bees... have... little... knees.

15:30.554 --> 15:31.805
Bees have little knees!

15:31.889 --> 15:33.307
Woo!

15:33.390 --> 15:35.351
-[buzzer rings repeatedly]
-[Jennifer chuckles]

15:35.434 --> 15:37.603
I feel like I've found my calling!

15:37.686 --> 15:39.438
The scoreboard agrees.

15:39.521 --> 15:42.733
Uh, Nobody's Puppets, 30 points.
Team Laurie--

15:42.816 --> 15:45.152
Zero! We know we have zero, Dave.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.531
[sighs] Okay, listen.
We're not done, all right?

15:49.615 --> 15:50.449
[clears throat]

15:52.993 --> 15:55.037
Little partner! All right.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.163
Time to rally!

15:56.872 --> 15:58.415
[yells] I said it's time to rally!

15:58.749 --> 15:59.833
Did we win?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.586
No, sweetie. We killed you.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.130
Good job, Mom.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.883
All right. Come on, you. Time for bed.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.010
[Laurie] No, no! It's not even midnight!

16:10.094 --> 16:11.470
Okay? I've got more games.

16:11.553 --> 16:14.139
Yeah, we've got Boggle,
and we have Catch Phrase.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.182
Thank you. Bye.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.019
All right.
Honey, play me in Yahtzee! All or nothing.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.854
Babe, I'm so tired.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.398
I choose nothing.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.568
That's because you're scared!
I win by forfeit!

16:29.071 --> 16:30.948
Laurie, one. [chuckles]

16:40.457 --> 16:42.001
What did you want to show me?

16:42.084 --> 16:44.628
I have a new way to tell Ryan I like him.

16:44.712 --> 16:48.882
I'm writing "I like you, Ryan"
in the foam of a latte.

16:48.966 --> 16:52.011
It's romantic, and playful...

16:52.720 --> 16:55.931
[bitterly]
and surprisingly hard to execute.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.100
[audience laughing]

16:58.684 --> 17:00.644
Are all of these your fails?

17:01.562 --> 17:05.858
I... like to call them my stepping stones
to success.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.194
Well, I'm going to help myself
to a cup of...

17:09.862 --> 17:11.238
"I like..." errrrr.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.244
This is a really cute idea,
but while you're down here,

17:17.327 --> 17:18.412
Ryan is up there

17:18.495 --> 17:21.790
listening to Hannah talk about
her My Little Pony fan fiction.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.128
You guys, it's almost midnight!
You're gonna miss the fireworks.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.548
Uh... Okay, okay. Forget the lattes.

17:29.631 --> 17:32.676
I'm just going to go up there
and tell Ryan I like him,

17:32.760 --> 17:33.802
right before the fireworks.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.930
That's a great idea,
and you'll look so good in that lighting.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.559
Really? Thank you! You too.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.186
-Oh, really?
-Really.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.312
-We should go.
-Oh, yeah.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.818
[Katie sighs and clears throat]

17:50.986 --> 17:53.572
I just.... I just need a second
to get in the zone.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.657
Okay. Good luck.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.622
-Oh, here we go!
-All right!

18:02.081 --> 18:03.082
You've got this.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.252
[all] Ten...

18:07.336 --> 18:08.629
nine...

18:08.712 --> 18:09.755
eight...

18:09.838 --> 18:10.714
seven...

18:11.381 --> 18:12.591
six...

18:12.674 --> 18:13.926
five...

18:14.009 --> 18:15.427
four...

18:15.511 --> 18:16.470
three...

18:16.553 --> 18:17.679
two...

18:17.763 --> 18:18.847
one!

18:18.931 --> 18:21.016
-Happy New Year!
-[fireworks]

18:21.767 --> 18:23.602
[party horns blowing]

18:27.731 --> 18:29.650
-Hi, Ryan.
-Hey, Katie. Happy New Year.

18:32.986 --> 18:35.197
I just thought I wanted to say...

18:39.159 --> 18:40.494
Happy New Year!

18:42.788 --> 18:44.414
Happy New Year to you, too.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.383
[exhales] Wow!

18:54.675 --> 18:55.592
Ha!

18:56.093 --> 18:58.637
"Quail!" Ha-ha! 45 points. [laughs]

18:59.263 --> 19:01.723
That's what happens
when you leave a triple word open.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.060
Oh, honey, I'm so glad you came back down
to play with me.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.646
It's only slightly worse
than the nightmare I was having.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.526
"Tat." Three points.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.947
Honey, you should have put it next
to the S and gotten a double word score!

19:17.698 --> 19:19.908
-You're letting me win, aren't you?
-Happy New Year!

19:19.992 --> 19:21.201
I love you!

19:23.287 --> 19:26.456
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
I'm ready for my epic party.

19:27.124 --> 19:28.458
So glad I took that nap.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.836
Wait. Have you been upstairs
this whole time?

19:31.086 --> 19:33.630
Don't wait up.
I'll see you in the new year!

19:33.714 --> 19:35.716
[chuckles]
Have fun at your little game night.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.720
-Should we stop him?
-No! I wanna see how this plays out.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.390
Why does my phone say 1 a.m.?

19:44.850 --> 19:46.852
[scoffs] Why do I have 47 messages?

19:47.436 --> 19:49.771
Why are there pictures
of people at the party?

19:50.230 --> 19:52.524
Why are they already crawling
out of the lake?

19:53.108 --> 19:55.027
Because you slept through everything.

19:55.777 --> 19:58.572
-[blows party horn]
-[both] Happy New Year!

20:00.616 --> 20:04.119
I'm not in any of these pictures!
What am I going to tell people?

20:04.203 --> 20:07.331
Tell them the truth. You're a sleepy boy.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.541
What do I do now?

20:10.125 --> 20:11.168
I'm wide awake.

20:11.251 --> 20:12.502
You could join us in Scrabble.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.296
Now you're just being mean.

20:21.553 --> 20:22.429
This was fun.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.223
I'm looking forward to your birthday.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.683
Thanks for the invite.
You know, you're really going all out.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.186
Yeah. Well, with everything
that's happened,

20:29.269 --> 20:31.897
it makes turning 16 that much sweeter.

20:32.731 --> 20:33.982
What's happened?

20:35.275 --> 20:38.195
Uh... You know, things and stuff.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.114
Aw. I love our super vague conversations.

20:44.701 --> 20:46.370
-[Katie] That was fun.
-[boy] I know.

20:46.495 --> 20:47.955
[indistinct chatter]

20:48.163 --> 20:51.250
Hey, latte to go?
We've got tons left over.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.085
-No, thanks.
-Yeah, enjoy.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.256
Bye, guys. Happy New Year!

20:58.632 --> 21:00.717
I'm sorry you didn't get to tell Ryan
how you feel.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.177
You know, it's...

21:02.719 --> 21:03.762
it's not over.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.682
I just realized
that I'm not a big public moment girl.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.642
Ha! You are not.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.062
I was just agreeing with you.

21:13.355 --> 21:16.942
Look, tonight didn't turn out
the way I was imagining, but...

21:17.317 --> 21:20.320
when the time's right,
I'll pull him aside and talk to him.

21:20.737 --> 21:24.116
Just the two of us.
You know, start with my peanut story.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.285
He'll get it.

21:26.827 --> 21:27.786
And...

21:28.412 --> 21:29.830
I'll tell him I like him.

21:30.747 --> 21:33.250
Yeah, if it's meant to be, it'll be.

21:33.750 --> 21:37.421
Well, when you get the chance, don't even
think about when you choked on your latte.

21:37.504 --> 21:38.839
That was so last year.

21:38.922 --> 21:42.009
Thanks. Thank you. [chuckles]

21:42.718 --> 21:45.012
-[Alexa] Happy New Year! Love you!
-Bye!

21:45.095 --> 21:47.180
[Ryan] I think that's everything.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.349
Oh, you got the lights! Thanks.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.934
Yeah. Need anything else?

21:51.018 --> 21:52.728
The two of us got it from here.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.063
You know what? I do need help.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.690
Yeah, could you go unlock the door?

22:02.487 --> 22:04.531
[mouthing]

22:05.365 --> 22:07.075
-Good night, Ryan.
-Good night!

22:10.454 --> 22:11.663
[Katie sighs]

22:11.997 --> 22:13.999
-[keys jingling]
-[Ryan huffs]

22:16.126 --> 22:16.960
[Katie] It's...

22:17.502 --> 22:19.629
It's kind of peaceful
when the lights are down.

22:19.713 --> 22:20.881
[Ryan] Yeah, it is.

22:21.715 --> 22:22.591
I like it.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.426
[Katie] Yeah. [chuckles]

22:26.720 --> 22:27.554
You know...

22:29.306 --> 22:30.390
Uh, well...

22:32.017 --> 22:34.728
Well, you know how when you crack open
a peanut,

22:34.811 --> 22:37.105
there's usually two nuts inside, and...

22:37.856 --> 22:39.066
not just one?

22:41.735 --> 22:42.569
Yeah.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.529
Yeah?

22:45.113 --> 22:46.031
Okay!

22:46.114 --> 22:48.784
Well, yeah. See, I knew you'd get it!
[chuckles]

22:51.536 --> 22:54.790
So there's something
I wanted to tell you... all night.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.001
You can tell me.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.379
Ryan...

23:01.838 --> 23:03.673
I really like...

23:05.425 --> 23:07.594
Oh, my gosh. The latte machine!

23:08.095 --> 23:09.304
Oh, my!
[screams]

23:09.388 --> 23:11.681
Okay! I forgot to check the dial!

23:11.765 --> 23:14.851
I was supposed to turn it off
if it got to 11, and it's at 15!

23:14.935 --> 23:17.979
-What happens at 15?
-Oh! That.

23:18.688 --> 23:20.273
[Ryan whimpers]

23:20.357 --> 23:22.734
Aah! Ooh! Hot! Um...

23:23.610 --> 23:24.736
-[Ryan] Yeah.
-Okay.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.697
Oh, my God!

23:28.740 --> 23:30.992
Oh, it's a fire! Fire!

23:31.451 --> 23:33.578
I... I... I've got it! Okay.

23:34.329 --> 23:36.039
-The pin.
-[Katie] Move!

23:36.415 --> 23:39.084
[screaming at the top of her lungs]

23:45.298 --> 23:47.300
-[Ryan huffs]
-[Katie sobs]

23:51.263 --> 23:52.097
So...

23:53.390 --> 23:54.307
uh...

23:55.016 --> 23:56.685
you were going to say something?

23:59.229 --> 24:00.439
-I'm in big trouble.
-Yeah.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.889
We'll do this together
