"Cops" is filmed on location

00:31.367 --> 00:33.433
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:33.467 --> 00:36.000
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:36.033 --> 00:39.000
in a court of law.

00:39.033 --> 00:41.233
-I've been in Richmond County
for the last 13 years,

00:41.267 --> 00:43.367
and I just recently started
volunteering my time

00:43.400 --> 00:46.600
to speak at different
organizations, to help
the community understand

00:46.633 --> 00:49.367
things that goes on
in law enforcement
on a day-to-day basis.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.167
I really have enjoyed
that opportunity

00:51.200 --> 00:53.300
to speak to them, and give them
the opportunity
to ask questions.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.867
I really think I'm gonna be
in it for a while,

00:54.900 --> 00:58.933
probably for the next 10
to 15 years of just
enjoying this opportunity,

00:58.967 --> 01:00.567
giving back
to the community.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.933

02:37.433 --> 02:39.333
-Okay, I'm just getting off,

-Get down.
-I'm tryin'.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.200
-We're inside a parking lot.

02:59.267 --> 03:00.533
-You stay down.

03:00.567 --> 03:02.133
Turn around.

03:03.833 --> 03:07.100
-Get that helmet off.

Subject in custody.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.733
-(radio chatter)

03:12.767 --> 03:13.833
-Put your hands out.

03:13.867 --> 03:14.867
-Hey, man, why you running?

03:16.300 --> 03:17.500
Roll over for me.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.100
Sit up.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.533
Got a license on you, man?

03:29.567 --> 03:31.500
-Uh, it's in my back pocket
right here, I think.

03:31.533 --> 03:33.133
-Why you running?

03:33.167 --> 03:35.900
-Because... I'm not supposed
to have the bike out.

03:35.933 --> 03:37.500
It comes through right here.

03:37.533 --> 03:39.100
See it?

03:39.133 --> 03:42.067
-This way?
-Yeah.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.567
-So you're not supposed
to have the bike out?

03:43.600 --> 03:44.967
-Yeah?
-Who's is it?

03:45.067 --> 03:47.067
It's my bike, but it's salvaged,
we fixing it, and I wanted

03:47.067 --> 03:48.833
to take my girl out on a ride.

03:48.867 --> 03:52.567
-Why didn't you just stop?
-Because... I'm not supposed--
it's a salvage title,

03:52.600 --> 03:55.567
not um, down...
for the rider title.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.967
-Why you try to k--
you gonna kill yourself, man.

03:58.067 --> 04:01.233
-Right, this is why
I wasn't inclined
to stop.

04:01.267 --> 04:03.533
I don't mind, I was wrong,
I was out of line.

04:03.567 --> 04:06.733
I'm not gonna sit here
and fight you, pretend to lie,
I was outta line.

04:06.767 --> 04:07.900
I just didn't want
to get her hurt.

04:07.933 --> 04:09.467
-Have we detained her yet?
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.800
-Run her for me real quick
and see if she's okay.
-Uh, we got her.

04:11.833 --> 04:13.733
-Um... y'all gonna arrest her?

04:13.767 --> 04:16.133
-We're tryin' to make sure
she don't have no warrants
or anything on her.

04:16.167 --> 04:17.733
If she's clean,
she's gonna be good to go, okay?

04:17.767 --> 04:19.600
-I wondered if at all possible
could she get my, uh,

04:19.633 --> 04:21.067
my bank card, and stuff
in my wallet?

04:21.067 --> 04:22.400
-Yeah, I'll give it to her.

04:22.433 --> 04:25.067
She's clean? All right.
-Yeah, she's good.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.333
-How you doin'?
-Fine.

04:28.367 --> 04:30.567
-You wasn't scared
when you was on there
with him?

04:30.600 --> 04:32.400
-Um, no. Not really.

04:32.433 --> 04:35.200
-You wasn't scared at all,
you weren't afraid he was
gonna wreck, anything like that?

04:35.233 --> 04:36.600
-No.
-Have y'all done this before?

04:36.633 --> 04:38.333
-No, this is my first time
ridin' the bike.

04:38.367 --> 04:40.700
First time ridin' the bike.
How long you known him?

04:40.733 --> 04:42.900
-Uh, it's about two years now.
-Two years?

04:42.933 --> 04:44.867
That's your
current boyfriend now?

04:44.900 --> 04:47.300
And he was just tryin'
to impress you
on a motorcycle.

04:47.333 --> 04:50.067
-Oh, no, I guess
I wanted to try it,
that was all.

04:50.067 --> 04:51.600
-Well, did you tell him
to stop, or you tell him

04:51.633 --> 04:53.067
to keep going,
or what you told him?

04:53.067 --> 04:55.367
-I didn't tell him anything,
I just rode, 'cause I'm like,

04:55.400 --> 04:57.100
uh, shocked, kind of.

04:57.133 --> 04:58.500
-So you's holding on
tight, right?

04:58.533 --> 05:00.600
-Yeah.
-Hopin' he didn't
fall off of it.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.233
-(laughs)
Basically.

05:02.267 --> 05:04.233
-Okay.
All right, um...

05:04.267 --> 05:05.967
you gonna be free to go, okay?

05:06.067 --> 05:08.167
Stand up for me, okay?

05:09.733 --> 05:12.267
-I'm gonna give you
his, um, wallet.
-Okay.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.967
-I'm gonna keep his IDs, okay?
-All right.

05:15.067 --> 05:18.533
The keys to the bike?
-No, the motorcycle
gonna get towed, okay?

05:18.567 --> 05:20.100
-He wanna talk to you
more before you go?
-Yeah.

05:20.133 --> 05:21.433
You come on over here.

05:21.467 --> 05:24.567
-Hey, I just wanna tell you
again I'm sorry, but listen,

05:24.600 --> 05:28.300
I put that money on top of--
uh, the cabinet in that
silver pan, on top

05:28.333 --> 05:31.400
of the cabinet.
Uh, tell the lady
for the rent they can wait.

05:31.433 --> 05:32.867
Uh, let 'em know
the situation, let 'em know

05:32.900 --> 05:34.600
however he understands it,
don't say anything...

05:34.633 --> 05:35.700
and he'll work it out.
-Right.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.500
-Love you, baby.
-I love you, too.

05:38.533 --> 05:40.067
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

05:40.067 --> 05:42.100
-I made a bad decision.
-I know.

05:42.133 --> 05:45.067
-If she wasn't
on the motorcycle, would you
have kept going?

05:45.067 --> 05:48.467
You'd a thought about it?
-Honestly... y'all would've
never caught me.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.733
-Would never caught you?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.767
What size is that motorcycle?
-A 650.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.433
-650?
-See, on the top speed,
we probably could get

05:55.467 --> 05:57.633
about 180, 200, maybe.
-Mm-hmm.

05:57.667 --> 06:00.433
-So your top speed,
you keep up with me,
but on acceleration, no.

06:00.467 --> 06:03.800
All I would have did was
pulled over till you caught up
to me, and then as soon

06:03.833 --> 06:06.767
as you caught up,
I woulda took off and you
woulda been over it.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.133
-Okay.
-I'da been gone.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.067
-So this is not your first--
This your first time doin' this?

06:10.067 --> 06:13.300
-Yeah. Well, I--
I just say that because
I'm a very good bike rider.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.633
-Okay.
-But I love her,
and I shouldn't be

06:15.667 --> 06:17.900
taking that risk.
I'd never take a risk
with another human life

06:17.933 --> 06:20.300
on there.
I'd risk my own life,
but I'm not gonna risk hers.

06:20.333 --> 06:22.333
-Yeah, 'cause guess what,
you could've-- the danger
behind it,

06:22.367 --> 06:23.833
'cause that car
that stopped in front of you,

06:23.867 --> 06:25.467
if you wouldn't turn around,

06:25.500 --> 06:28.133
you'd a hit the back of it.
Right here at Twiggs and, uh,
James Brown.

06:28.167 --> 06:32.300
Um...
-I mean, that's what I said,
with her, understand,

06:32.333 --> 06:34.533
the balance is different,
the weight is different,
-Yeah.

06:34.567 --> 06:38.067
and all that is different.
With me on that, that
wasn't even an issue at all.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.333
Intersection stuff, man.
-Don't you-- You gotta

06:40.367 --> 06:42.267
think about the people,
the lives you put in jeopardy.

06:42.300 --> 06:43.500
You put her life in jeopardy.
-Right.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.133
-Yours.
-Right, that's why
I had to stop.

06:45.167 --> 06:47.333
-Other people. So, I'm glad
nobody pulled out
in front of us, 'cause...

06:47.367 --> 06:50.967
you'd a t-boned him.
Both of y'all be hurt real bad.
-That's why I stopped.

06:51.067 --> 06:53.367
-You goin' to jail, okay,
for felony attempt to elude
an officer.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.667
It was a bad decision.
You learn from it.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.600
-I got my degree in Biology,
I always wanted to be
a marine biologist

07:00.633 --> 07:03.167
and ended up gettin'
my Masters degree
out in Washington State.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.333
And while I was there,
worked for Washington
Fish and Game.

07:06.367 --> 07:09.100
Got tied in with their
Fish and Game Patrol,
and I got hooked

07:09.133 --> 07:11.267
on law enforcement,
and realized that my skills

07:11.300 --> 07:12.933
that I learned
in the science field

07:12.967 --> 07:15.233
applied to law enforcement.

07:15.267 --> 07:18.067
And pretty much studied
criminals like I did fish.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.733
We're headin' to a bar.
There's a dispatch report
and there's a fight.

07:22.767 --> 07:25.200
Female wearin' a bikini,
and she has her small child
there.

07:25.233 --> 07:28.467
Apparently she left
her child at the bar,
and she's runnin'.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.367
-You guys hear me out,
my husband and...

07:34.400 --> 07:35.933
(inaudible)

07:35.967 --> 07:38.800
...and his friends between
the last four days.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.300
This is not--
This is not fun,
this is not a joke,

07:41.333 --> 07:43.967
this is dead serious.
I've asked these people...
-Hi.

07:44.067 --> 07:46.300
-Who are you?
-Oh, I'm just a witness.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.333
-Okay.
-Whew.

07:48.367 --> 07:50.867
-Sorry, I'm a little
out of breath, I had to sprint

07:50.900 --> 07:52.233
'cause she was gonna
leave her kid.

07:52.267 --> 07:54.600
She left the kid
in the stroller there,
and just started--

07:54.633 --> 07:57.067
boltin' down 18th Street.

07:57.067 --> 07:58.700
-What for,
what's she runnin' for?
Any idea?

07:58.733 --> 08:01.367
-Drunk as (bleep), yeah.
-Do you know her?

08:01.400 --> 08:04.200
-No. She come into
the tavern down here.
-Yup.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.800
With the kid.
-With the kid.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.700
-Okay.
-Drinkin'. And we all
took offense to it

08:08.733 --> 08:14.100
-Yup.
-She snapped, slammed her beer
on the-- on the bar.

08:14.133 --> 08:16.400
-Okay.
-Little girl was out
of her stroller...

08:16.433 --> 08:19.367
-Just kinda roamin'
around the bar?
-She fell-- fell down on top

08:19.400 --> 08:24.467
of her daughter.
She got all mad at us,
'cause we said no.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.967
-Okay.
-9-1-1.

08:27.067 --> 08:28.067
You know...

08:28.067 --> 08:29.533
-Thanks, man.

08:29.567 --> 08:31.533
Chamberlin Automotive.
-I'll be goddamn it
if I lose my daughter.

08:31.567 --> 08:33.233
-We are at...
-I'm just gonna let
you all know that.

08:33.267 --> 08:36.167
Right now!
I don't (bleep) care.
-How much-- How much

08:36.200 --> 08:39.667
have you had to drink today?
-I've had about three beers
and three shots.

08:39.700 --> 08:43.133
-Okay.
-Test me, I wish you
(bleep) would.

08:43.167 --> 08:44.967
-We will. So, just--
-Please do.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.367
-Relax.
Does that make sense to be--

08:47.400 --> 08:50.600
-'Cause I'm gonna take this
to all to court, and I'm
gonna beat your all cases.

08:50.633 --> 08:53.433
-Take what?

08:53.467 --> 08:55.733
What are you gonna
take to court?
-You're gonna find out,

08:55.767 --> 08:57.567
because I'm not even
gonna say nothin' else.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.767
-Okay. Basically,
at this point in time--
-Please step away

08:59.800 --> 09:01.767
from my daughter.
-Ma'am...

09:01.800 --> 09:04.500
-This is me askin'
you nicely. I don't care
what you're askin'.

09:04.533 --> 09:06.667
I don't care what you're askin'.
-Put your hands
behind your back.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.467
-No, dude, because you
don't have the physical right--

09:08.500 --> 09:10.733
you don't have
the physical right, bud,
and this is me askin' nicely.

09:10.767 --> 09:14.133
-Put your hands behind
your back.
-Relax.

09:14.167 --> 09:16.133
-You done popped my (bleep).
-Relax.

09:16.167 --> 09:18.100
-You done popped it
out of place,
and you know it.

09:18.133 --> 09:20.933
I'm physically, I'm relaxed,
and you know it.

09:20.967 --> 09:25.100
Your-- Your-- You guys
are (bleep) under (inaudible)'s
name and you know it.

09:25.133 --> 09:26.367
And he knows it, too.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.433
-Okay.
-I don't wanna hear
what you (bleep) know.

09:28.467 --> 09:31.600
What I'm sayin' is
what's (bleep) now because
that's under attorney.

09:31.633 --> 09:34.767
-I'm just...
-You (bleep) that's under three
different attorneys,

09:34.800 --> 09:37.767
and you're about
to have your case beat.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.467
My (bleep) is under
three different people.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.433
-Hey, I'm just gonna tell you,
-You, you, and you--

09:41.467 --> 09:43.167
-you're not my concern.
-I-- That's fine.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.067
-That's my concern.
-That is my concern, too.

09:45.067 --> 09:47.467
-It doesn't seem like it
if you're at the bar
doin' shots and drinkin' beer.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.467
-Okay, I'm at the bar
doin' shots, tryin' to find
a job.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.567
-Is that the way to do it?
-I don't know how else
to do it, because

09:53.600 --> 09:55.433
none of my friends
and family will help me.

09:55.467 --> 09:57.467
-Well, let's go have a seat
in the car real quick, okay?

09:57.500 --> 09:59.533
-Okay, if I can take
my daughter, that is fine.

09:59.567 --> 10:01.667
As long as I can have her
by my side, I don't care.

10:01.700 --> 10:05.367
Please don't do this,
I don't know why
everybody's blamin' me.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.100
-Have a seat in the car.
-(radio chatter)

10:08.133 --> 10:11.833
-Have a seat in the car.
-And then my daughter is sittin'
way over there.

10:11.867 --> 10:14.200
-So, she already admitted
that she was at the bar
drinkin' beer,

10:14.233 --> 10:16.633
doin' shots,
everything else like that.
-She's drinkin' vodka

10:16.667 --> 10:17.967
outta this water bottle.
-Is that vodka?

10:18.000 --> 10:24.033
-Yeah.
-So... that witness tells me
that she came in

10:24.067 --> 10:29.033
to apply for a job,
started doin' shots...
gets mad at the whole thing,

10:29.067 --> 10:32.467
'cause she let her kid
wander around? They told her
to leave.

10:32.500 --> 10:36.733
She slams her beer down,
trips over the child,
hits the floor. That's when

10:36.767 --> 10:39.533
everybody stood up
to try to intervene,
and she took off runnin'

10:39.567 --> 10:41.567
this way when everybody
showed up, so...

10:41.600 --> 10:44.533
-This is in front of
my two-year-old daughter.
This isn't funny.

10:44.567 --> 10:46.333
-That's what we're
worried about.
-Exactly. I'm worried

10:46.367 --> 10:48.600
about the same thing.
-So we wanna talk to you...

10:48.633 --> 10:51.167
-So why is that no...
-We need to have her
go someplace safe

10:51.200 --> 10:56.167
while we do that, Mom.
-Someplace safe? And what
the (bleep) is that?

10:56.200 --> 10:59.233
-Hey, Officer Swagler
back here is gonna give you
a PBT test, all right?

10:59.267 --> 11:02.067
It's just a breathalyzer test
to see what your blood alcohol
level is.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.900
-No. No. No.
Then what is the state limit?

11:03.933 --> 11:05.667
-The state limit?
-Yes. Yes.

11:05.700 --> 11:08.800
-For driving, it's .08.
-.08? Let's do it, then.

11:08.833 --> 11:11.467
-For driving, okay.
Go ahead and blow.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.067
Blow.
There you go.

11:14.067 --> 11:17.067
-Can I see it, please?
-Yeah. Sure.

11:17.067 --> 11:21.800
-.08, right?
-Yeah. Oh, you're past
a 0.1.

11:21.833 --> 11:24.300
-Well, that's fine, but if I'm
hammered and you're here to
pick up after me,

11:24.333 --> 11:30.633
there's nothing you
or these officers can do.
.08 is legal limit.

11:30.667 --> 11:32.500
-You're over that.
-Right. You're over that.

11:32.533 --> 11:35.067
-Okay, exactly, but if I'm
havin' someone else pick up
after me, there's nothin'

11:35.067 --> 11:39.900
you guys can do after that.
My husband assaulted me
and my daughter!

11:39.933 --> 11:46.100
There's nothing you guys
can do! I'm worried about
from this...

11:46.133 --> 11:50.233
Please do. Please do.
-Mary? It appears to have
stopped at-- woop, still

11:50.267 --> 11:51.567
goin' up.
-Let's go up, then.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.067
Let's please do.
-It stopped at a 1.182.

11:54.100 --> 11:58.867
-Exactly. Why are you
holding us up then? 1.83.
-Right, it moved up

11:58.900 --> 12:02.700
right before I let go.
-No, but get your (bleep)
handcuffs on me-- off me,

12:02.733 --> 12:07.600
bud, because I'm callin'
my (bleep) lawyer right now.
No, bud, don't put your hands

12:07.633 --> 12:09.833
on me, bitch.
I'm callin' my lawyer...
-You need to just relax

12:09.867 --> 12:11.900
for a second, okay,
take a deep breath.
-I'm callin' my (bleep)

12:11.933 --> 12:15.833
attorney...
-Your-- Your grandmother--
Your grandmother is on the way.

12:15.867 --> 12:19.267
She's very concerned,.
And so your grandmother's
on the way up here, okay?

12:19.300 --> 12:23.367
Our concern right now
is you and your daughter.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.467
-I'm Officer Coughennower
with the Des Moines
Police Department,

12:25.500 --> 12:28.067
and basically,
the whole situation behind
this gal comin' in here.

12:28.067 --> 12:31.433
She told us that she was looking
for employment,
-She was.

12:31.467 --> 12:34.867
-and that she came in here,
and she started drinkin',
and then...

12:34.900 --> 12:37.833
-I never served her.
-So she brought in
all her own stuff...

12:37.867 --> 12:39.400
-Yeah, she brought... yeah.

12:39.433 --> 12:43.967
And she was talking
to a guy. I told her that,
you know, if you guys

12:44.067 --> 12:47.700
wanna talk, that's fine,
but the kid needs to be
watched. She was rollin' around

12:47.733 --> 12:51.067
on the ground, in the bar...
-Unsupervised.

12:51.067 --> 12:53.333
-Unsupervised.
-And then, at one point
in time,

12:53.367 --> 12:56.333
she slammed a beverage down
on the bar, got upset,
tripped over the child

12:56.367 --> 12:58.633
or the stroller...
-She kicked the kid
in the face.

12:58.667 --> 13:00.233
-Really?
-She kicked her.

13:00.267 --> 13:01.767
Yeah, and when...
-Completely outta control.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.967
I went outside tryin'
to get the kid out
of the screaming match.

13:04.067 --> 13:07.200
-Yeah.
-And then she came out,
followed me, and grabbed

13:07.233 --> 13:10.967
the kid off of me.
-Okay. Great job for callin'
9-1-1 and gettin' everybody

13:11.067 --> 13:14.167
goin' on this, okay?
Um, she's goin' to jail.
She struck the kid.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.933
She's obviously intoxicated
in public, cannot take care--
-The kid won't be, like,

13:17.967 --> 13:21.333
go back to her.
-Well, at this point right now,
no, she's gonna have

13:21.367 --> 13:23.567
to demonstrate that she's able
to be a parent again,

13:23.600 --> 13:25.367
and that's just not behavior...
-Okay, good.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.133
-that's-- you know, conducive
with bein' a parent.

13:29.633 --> 13:33.067
-We work high crime areas,
uh, high narcotics, gangs.
Our u-number's

13:33.067 --> 13:35.500
40 Zebra. Uh, that's
how they know us.

13:35.533 --> 13:38.267
We're with the Crime Control
Division of Harris County

13:38.300 --> 13:41.967
Sheriff's Office.
So that's why we have
zebra's hanging

13:42.067 --> 13:43.667
from-- from our mirrors,

13:43.700 --> 13:45.933
If you ever see a zebra.

13:45.967 --> 13:49.567
This car's missin'
a front license plate.
We'll go ahead and stop him.

13:52.067 --> 13:55.600
-(radio chatter)

13:58.267 --> 14:00.900
-What's up, man?
The reason you're bein' stopped
is no front license plate.

14:00.933 --> 14:02.900
-You have a driver's license
on you?
-Yes, sir.

14:02.933 --> 14:04.900
Come on out.

14:04.933 --> 14:06.567
Go stand over there
for me.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.300
You don't have any weapons
or anything on you?
-No, sir. Uh, yes, uh, yes,

14:09.333 --> 14:10.733
my knife right here.
-In here?

14:10.767 --> 14:11.933
-Yeah.
-All right, turn around.

14:11.967 --> 14:14.933
-That's only for work.
-That's fine.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.733
-Have you ever been
in trouble before?
-Uh, no, sir.

14:19.767 --> 14:21.267
-Okay.
-No, not at all...

14:21.300 --> 14:26.700
-All right, go stand
over there. All the way
over by the house.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.500
Uh, he says he's-- he don't
have a driver's license.
He said he'd never been

14:31.533 --> 14:34.500
in trouble.
He seemed pretty nervous,
his hands were shaking

14:34.533 --> 14:37.733
when he gave me his ID.

14:37.767 --> 14:38.933
Where were you born?

14:38.967 --> 14:40.933
-Uh, Houston.
-You're born in Texas?

14:40.967 --> 14:43.533
-Yes, sir.
Okay. You ever get in trouble
anywhere else?

14:43.567 --> 14:45.300
-No, sir.
-No. You don't ever go
to the East Coast

14:45.333 --> 14:46.933
or anything like that?
-Oh, no, sir.

14:46.967 --> 14:48.767
-You know you gotta
get your registration
fixed, right?

14:48.800 --> 14:49.833
You can stay over there.

14:49.867 --> 14:51.133
-Um, I was about to do that
right now.

14:51.167 --> 14:53.467
-Right now?
-Not right now,
but I get paid tomorrow.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.267
-I was gonna say
'cause this isn't the DMV, bud.

14:55.300 --> 14:57.267
-I get paid tomorrow, sir.
-Okay.

14:57.300 --> 15:01.467
-I was just, 'cause
right now, I kinda am,
uh, I'm not gonna lie to you,

15:01.500 --> 15:03.167
I'm kinda homeless.
-Uh-huh.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.700
-And I'm just waitin'
for my first paycheck,
so I-- I can fix everything.

15:06.733 --> 15:08.067
-So you don't live here?

15:08.067 --> 15:09.267
-Huh?
-You don't live here?

15:09.300 --> 15:10.833
-Oh, I seen you, so I didn't
wanna pull right here,

15:10.867 --> 15:12.267
'cause it's just gonna
stop everything.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.833
So I just pulled in,
I already seen y'all,
with the lights.

15:14.867 --> 15:17.533
-You were gettin' ready
to turn left before I even
turned on my lights, bud.

15:17.567 --> 15:19.267
-Sorry, what?
-You were gettin' ready
to turn in here

15:19.300 --> 15:20.467
before my lights
were even on.

15:20.500 --> 15:24.633
-Oh... since I live
down there. Uh... Shady Oaks.

15:24.667 --> 15:27.567
-I thought you were homeless.
-Huh? Oh, I stay with a friend.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.067
I stay on the couch.
-Is there a reason
you're so nervous?

15:30.100 --> 15:32.133
-Oh, no. (laughs)
It's just, I'm tired.

15:32.167 --> 15:33.633
-Have you ever been
pulled over before?

15:33.667 --> 15:35.267
-No, sir,
this is the first time.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.500
-Do you have
anything illegal in this car?
-Oh, this is the second time.

15:37.533 --> 15:39.967
-Do you have anything
illegal in this car?
-I-- I don't-- I shouldn't have.

15:40.067 --> 15:41.667
-Okay. You don't mind
if I take a quick look?
-Um...

15:41.700 --> 15:43.500
-Make sure you don't
have any guns or anything
in there?

15:43.533 --> 15:46.533
-Oh... (laughs) go ahead, sir.
-Just take a seat right there,

15:46.567 --> 15:47.700
-Yeah, for sure.
-on that bench.

15:49.267 --> 15:51.067
-No guns, sir.
-Okay, good.

15:51.100 --> 15:54.067
-(laughs)
-Seemed like he didn't really
want me to look in here.

15:54.067 --> 15:58.600
'Cause usually when you see
this, it's-- there's marijuana
somewhere, 'cause

15:58.633 --> 16:01.233
that little sleeve joint,
whatever they wanna call it.

16:01.267 --> 16:04.433
Before I keep lookin', man,
honesty's the best policy,
all right?

16:04.467 --> 16:07.167
You got
any marijuana in the car?
-Uh... I probably do

16:07.200 --> 16:09.100
have a little bit.
-Where's it at?

16:09.133 --> 16:10.767
-Uh...
-Just stay there,
just tell me.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.733
-It may be
in the middle console.
-Okay.

16:12.767 --> 16:16.333
-Or, uh...
maybe in the trunk.

16:16.367 --> 16:19.200
-Okay.
-Um. I might have--
I'm not gonna lie,

16:19.233 --> 16:22.333
I might have... a little bit...
a little bit of coke.

16:22.367 --> 16:24.433
-Uh-huh. You might have
a little bit of coke?
-Yeah.

16:24.467 --> 16:25.600
-Okay.
-Uh...

16:25.633 --> 16:27.067
-Come here real quick.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.933
-Yeah. I'm not
gonna lie to you.
-I understand. I understand.

16:28.967 --> 16:30.367
-Put your hands
behind your back.
-Yes, sir.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.967
-We're just gonna make sure.
-I ain't gonna lie to you, sir.

16:33.067 --> 16:35.633
-Where's this little bit
of cocaine gonna be?

16:35.667 --> 16:38.933
-Uh... maybe in my backpack.
-Maybe your backpack?

16:38.967 --> 16:40.367
-Yeah?
-Okay.

16:42.700 --> 16:46.833
He says he's homeless,
but then he says he's stayin'
down the street.

16:46.867 --> 16:49.733
Says he pulled in here
'cause he saw me, but he
was pullin' in here

16:49.767 --> 16:53.400
before I even had my lights on,
so... he's obviously
just tryin' to get in here

16:53.433 --> 16:54.800
and get away from us.

16:54.833 --> 16:56.200
-Where's it gonna be
in your backpack?

16:56.233 --> 16:59.133
-Uh, probably that front pocket.
-This one?

16:59.167 --> 17:03.367
-Okay.
-That's a little more
than a little bit.

17:03.400 --> 17:06.800
Personal use,
do you sell, or...?
-No, personal use, sir.

17:06.833 --> 17:10.600
-Okay.
-I... 'cause I work a lot.
I work a lotta hours.

17:10.633 --> 17:12.800
-You got some methamphetamine
in there, too?
-I got it, yeah,

17:12.833 --> 17:15.067
I got a little bit.
It's all personal use, though.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.067
-That's all personal use.
-It's all personal use, sir.

17:17.067 --> 17:18.933
That's why they're not
baggied up or nothin'.

17:18.967 --> 17:22.067
-So what you're telling me
is you smoke methamphetamine...
-No, I sniff it.

17:22.067 --> 17:27.733
-You sniff-- okay, so you
snort methamphetamine...
cocaine.... and marijuana?

17:27.767 --> 17:31.567
-Uh, well, that's only
to go to sleep. But I don't
do it while I drive.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.433
-I'm not on it
right now or anything,
it's just to stay up.

17:34.467 --> 17:36.533
-Well, I understand.
I'm not talkin' about
when you're drivin',

17:36.567 --> 17:39.300
I'm just sayin', that's a--
that's a variety right
there, brother.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.233
-(laughs)
-We're gonna go back
to the honesty, okay?

17:41.267 --> 17:44.433
I didn't have my lights on,
you turned in here, were you
tryin' to get away

17:44.467 --> 17:47.067
from me?
-No, sir.
No. Once I turned,

17:47.100 --> 17:50.567
I seen your lights on the car.
-I didn't have my lights on
when you turned, bud.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.100
-I'd seen them, sir.
Yeah.
-Okay.

17:53.133 --> 17:57.467
-So I was like, okay.
You know... I already knew
I was gonna get stopped

17:57.500 --> 18:00.833
because of the license plate.
-Mm. All right, bud.

18:00.867 --> 18:05.733
Is that gonna be it?
-And maybe a personal scale
just to weigh my stuff.

18:05.767 --> 18:08.067
I have peace of mind, you know,
I mean, that I'm not
