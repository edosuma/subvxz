<i>Strike Back...</i>

00:03.450 --> 00:04.650
You going somewhere?

00:04.675 --> 00:05.875
I can't do this anymore.

00:06.932 --> 00:07.937
What's that?

00:07.938 --> 00:09.268
It's a list of my
requirements if I'm gonna

00:09.293 --> 00:10.632
come work for Section 20.

00:10.657 --> 00:11.678
Work for Section 20?

00:11.703 --> 00:13.938
Me and your boy saved the
lives of all those hostages.

00:13.963 --> 00:16.090
That hotel would have gone up in
flames if it weren't for us!

00:17.647 --> 00:19.533
The is the man that
we think is Latif?

00:19.558 --> 00:21.290
This man is Abasi Sawalha.

00:21.488 --> 00:23.588
Latif outmaneuvered us all.

00:23.613 --> 00:25.770
You will tell me everything
I need to know.

00:25.795 --> 00:27.682
You were brought in
to identify Latif,

00:27.707 --> 00:30.087
a man whom it turned out
you'd never even seen.

00:30.112 --> 00:32.458
If Latif, connects back to
what happened to me in Iraq.

00:32.482 --> 00:33.793
You don't want to prove all
this just to end up with a

00:33.818 --> 00:35.018
bullet in your brain, do you?

02:26.429 --> 02:27.830
What
the fuck is going on?

02:27.864 --> 02:30.499
I'm standing out like
a dildo in Disneyland.

02:32.336 --> 02:35.338
<i>Hold your position. Sierra one, camera up.</i>

02:35.372 --> 02:37.006
We see you.

02:38.342 --> 02:41.144
<i>Target</i>
<i>one is approaching.</i>

02:41.178 --> 02:45.648
Target one, Beruti
Lefu. South African national.

02:45.683 --> 02:48.185
Middle-ranking
underworld player.

02:48.219 --> 02:54.092
Seen here with a known
contact of... Latif.

02:57.430 --> 03:00.932
<i>Okay, got</i>
<i>eyes on the "Three Stooges."</i>

03:03.136 --> 03:05.471
Looks like they got to
where they're going.

03:08.374 --> 03:10.843
He's hired muscle and
he's on the move.

03:10.877 --> 03:12.512
I want you up there.

03:12.546 --> 03:14.180
I want to know what
he's carrying.

03:14.215 --> 03:17.350
But, most of all, I want
to know who he's meeting.

03:36.670 --> 03:38.604
<i>Status?</i>

03:38.639 --> 03:39.639
Sierra in position.

03:39.673 --> 03:41.674
Kilo in position.

03:41.709 --> 03:43.910
Delta in position.
Hey, who are you talking to?

03:43.944 --> 03:46.079
All right,
let's move in three...two...

03:46.114 --> 03:47.180
Who are you talking to?

03:47.215 --> 03:49.049
No one, buddy, no one.
Just keep cooking, huh?

03:49.083 --> 03:51.284
What the hell is that?
Who are you talking to?

03:51.318 --> 03:52.352
Not now,
buddy, not now, huh?

03:52.386 --> 03:53.453
What the fuck?

03:53.487 --> 03:54.955
Who are you talking to?
God!

03:58.026 --> 04:00.561
You're
talking to God?

04:00.595 --> 04:02.097
That's fucking funny, huh?

04:02.131 --> 04:04.666
Hey God!
He's talking to you.

04:07.069 --> 04:09.537
Hey, God, the American
is talking to God!

04:09.572 --> 04:11.139
Hey, shh, shh...
Come on.

04:11.173 --> 04:12.407
Shoosh?
Yeah.

04:12.441 --> 04:16.077
Ahh! Ahh!

04:17.846 --> 04:19.313
Do you hear that?

04:19.346 --> 04:20.880
Yeah, let's go!

04:23.418 --> 04:25.386
Target visual!

04:28.122 --> 04:30.123
<i>Targets on the move!</i>

04:32.260 --> 04:35.295
Capture. Do not kill.
Repeat, capture, do not kill.

04:40.300 --> 04:41.500
Fuck!

04:54.347 --> 04:55.514
Fuck!

04:59.587 --> 05:01.655
Stop!
Put the gun down!

05:03.024 --> 05:04.925
Shit.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.494
<i>Give me status.</i>

05:08.763 --> 05:12.132
<i>Confirm.</i>
<i>Target is alive.</i>

05:13.067 --> 05:14.435
Is he alive? Confirm.

05:14.469 --> 05:15.536
<i>Is he alive?</i>

05:15.570 --> 05:17.304
Shit. Target two is down.

05:17.338 --> 05:18.939
<i>I repeat, target two is down.</i>

05:33.554 --> 05:36.123
Shit!

06:00.816 --> 06:03.418
Stay down!

06:08.958 --> 06:12.160
For fuck sake.
Capture, not kill.

Yep. Let's
hit the road.

<i>All doors locked,</i>

08:38.739 --> 08:40.607
Unit 71, travelling.

08:40.642 --> 08:41.942
Okay, you are free to go.

08:41.976 --> 08:43.177
Roll, Jedi.

09:23.451 --> 09:24.919
You'd
better hope he talks.

09:24.920 --> 09:25.790
If I hadn't taken him out,

09:25.799 --> 09:27.019
he would've killed you.

09:27.022 --> 09:28.856
He only got that
chance because of you.

09:28.890 --> 09:30.924
I don't need you rushing
to my assistance, Sergeant.

09:30.959 --> 09:32.560
Okay.

09:32.594 --> 09:34.295
You end up killing two of the men
we're supposed to bring in.

09:34.329 --> 09:36.297
Threatening our
only lead to Latif.

09:36.331 --> 09:37.631
If it hadn't
been for Scott...

09:37.666 --> 09:40.300
Talking about me again?

09:40.335 --> 09:41.735
Well?

09:41.769 --> 09:44.471
He's the muscle, the
petty thief from Soweto.

09:44.506 --> 09:46.373
We're not being held
up by a common criminal.

09:46.407 --> 09:47.441
Right, with me.

09:47.475 --> 09:48.675
Yes, Ma'am.

09:56.985 --> 09:59.019
Now, let me make this clear.

09:59.054 --> 10:01.111
Whoever it is you're
most afraid of right

10:01.136 --> 10:02.336
now is nothing...

10:02.657 --> 10:04.658
Compared to me.

10:09.063 --> 10:11.465
All right.
He's got good family?

10:11.500 --> 10:15.770
Yeah. You've got a
mother...got a father...

10:16.805 --> 10:18.107
And two sisters.

10:18.141 --> 10:22.278
Right. Find them.
Bring them in. Leave no trace.

10:22.312 --> 10:24.948
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Wait!

10:24.982 --> 10:27.951
I don't know who the man
is we were going to see.

10:27.985 --> 10:29.619
I didn't see his face.

10:29.654 --> 10:32.990
What was in the case? Hmm?

10:34.492 --> 10:36.860
What was in the case?

10:36.894 --> 10:39.296
Look, what happened out there,
happened because of us.

10:39.330 --> 10:40.664
There is no "us."
Kate...

10:41.515 --> 10:44.318
Michael, you made your
feelings perfectly clear.

10:44.336 --> 10:47.071
When we're out there, you
can treat me as a soldier.

10:48.541 --> 10:50.909
He sold route maps
for an armored truck company.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.377
Get them all on the phone!

10:52.412 --> 10:54.847
I want every truck, every driver,
stopped and secured, now!

10:59.219 --> 11:02.355
This isn't where
my dad lives.

11:02.389 --> 11:06.092
Don't you worry, lad. You'll
see your dad soon enough.

11:51.006 --> 11:52.840
Terry...

11:52.874 --> 11:55.209
Jeff, that's my boy.

11:55.243 --> 11:56.677
Jeff, that's my son.

11:58.746 --> 12:00.680
Terry, what the fuck?

12:20.535 --> 12:22.737
<i>Unit 71, state your position.</i>

12:23.772 --> 12:25.440
If we go out there,
we are dead.

12:25.474 --> 12:27.242
- <i>This is command control...</i>
- <i>Understand?</i>

12:27.277 --> 12:29.711
<i>Come in, over.</i>
<i>Jeff, that's my boy.</i>

12:29.746 --> 12:33.515
You understand?
That's my fucking boy!

12:33.549 --> 12:35.316
<i>This</i>
<i>is command control...</i>

12:35.351 --> 12:40.188
<i>Unit 71. Come in, over...</i>
<i>Unit 71? Please respond.</i>

12:40.223 --> 12:41.390
I'm picking that up...

12:41.424 --> 12:42.625
You can't pick that up, Jeff.

12:42.659 --> 12:44.928
<i>Unit 71, please respond.</i>

12:44.962 --> 12:47.163
That's my boy!
<i>This is command control!</i>

12:47.197 --> 12:49.999
<i>Please, state your</i>
<i>position, over.</i>

12:51.735 --> 12:54.571
<i>State your position, Unit 71.</i>

12:54.605 --> 12:57.808
<i>Unit 71, state your</i>
<i>position, over...</i>

12:57.842 --> 13:00.744
Jeff!

13:00.778 --> 13:02.846
Jeff, fuck man!

13:02.880 --> 13:05.916
<i>Unit 71, please,</i>
<i>come in, over.</i>

13:05.950 --> 13:07.551
Oh!

13:07.585 --> 13:08.618
Fuck.

13:22.433 --> 13:24.868
Yeah, listen to your dad.
Come over here for a moment.

13:24.902 --> 13:27.637
Hey. Hey, where are
you taking my son?

13:27.671 --> 13:29.138
- Take me.
- Stay there.

13:29.206 --> 13:30.707
Where are you taking him, sir?

13:32.843 --> 13:35.378
I want you
to look at the trees.

13:36.813 --> 13:39.315
You see the way they
bend in the wind?

13:41.452 --> 13:44.788
I want you to watch the
shapes that they make. Okay?

13:49.327 --> 13:50.361
Please...

13:50.395 --> 13:52.763
That's a fine boy
you have there.

13:56.868 --> 13:58.235
Go.

14:38.475 --> 14:40.510
Come on,
Hugo! Come on, let's go!

14:51.855 --> 14:53.689
Hugo, move! Hugo!

14:53.724 --> 14:55.491
Aw, fuck me!

15:05.169 --> 15:06.736
For fuck's sake.

15:13.376 --> 15:16.011
Take his hands off. Put a
bullet through his teeth.

16:07.789 --> 16:09.790
How did we miss this?

16:09.824 --> 16:12.592
A call did go out. The robbery
was already in progress.

16:12.627 --> 16:15.061
All three guards were shot.

16:15.096 --> 16:17.063
What's strange is that
no money was taken.

16:17.097 --> 16:18.330
What about the other guy?

16:18.365 --> 16:21.100
Shot, hands severed, jaw
blown to pieces, presumably...

16:21.134 --> 16:22.901
To hide his identity, yeah.

16:22.936 --> 16:25.003
Well, the only survivor
was the little boy.

16:25.037 --> 16:27.346
Son of one of the dead guards.
He was abducted near his

16:27.371 --> 16:28.916
home earlier in the afternoon.

16:29.007 --> 16:30.074
Jesus...

16:30.109 --> 16:32.443
The CCTV in the back of
the van was sprayed...

16:32.478 --> 16:34.129
But we've managed to
reconfigure some of the images

16:34.154 --> 16:35.686
captured just beforehand.

16:42.019 --> 16:43.319
Daniel Connolly.

16:43.353 --> 16:44.553
Hardcore IRA.

16:44.588 --> 16:47.055
The Good Friday Agreement
put him on the run.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.258
Kosovo, Chechnya...

16:49.292 --> 16:53.795
Now, he touts himself around
as some kind of mercenary.

16:53.829 --> 16:55.732
All right, there was something
else on that van.

16:55.757 --> 16:56.957
I want to know what it was.

16:57.999 --> 17:02.135
This is not about money.
This is about hate.

18:48.412 --> 18:50.579
What's the matter?

18:53.650 --> 18:55.117
Tell me.

18:56.853 --> 18:59.154
I had a dream last night.

19:02.725 --> 19:07.795
I was a boy, back at my
mother's old house.

19:12.101 --> 19:14.904
You could smell the chips
frying in the kitchen.

19:16.239 --> 19:19.809
And the creaky floorboard, on
the bottom step.

19:25.383 --> 19:28.152
I came down the stairs
and opened the front door.

19:31.223 --> 19:33.424
Someone was standing there...

19:35.060 --> 19:37.328
Someone I knew.

19:39.898 --> 19:41.332
Yeah?

19:48.241 --> 19:49.641
They'd come to kill me.

19:52.479 --> 19:54.046
To kill me...

20:09.529 --> 20:10.696
Teague!

20:20.808 --> 20:22.642
So?

20:22.676 --> 20:26.112
Hugo downloaded the
files, before he got shot.

20:30.351 --> 20:32.518
We're going visiting.

20:35.556 --> 20:39.625
But Daniel, the data's no
good to us without a hacker.

20:39.659 --> 20:40.726
We don't have Hugo.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.828
Well, there's another
Hugo coming.

20:49.202 --> 20:50.402
Hey.

20:51.537 --> 20:52.437
What you got there?

20:52.472 --> 20:53.739
What have I got?

20:53.773 --> 20:55.675
Yeah.

20:55.709 --> 20:57.343
That, Sergeant, is a
future-proof, impenetrable

20:57.368 --> 20:58.847
encryption data storage unit.

20:59.212 --> 21:01.346
Wow.
Mmm-hmm.

21:01.381 --> 21:07.085
You know, in my experience,
nothing is impenetrable...

21:07.119 --> 21:09.487
We know it wasn't money, they
were after, so what was it?

21:09.521 --> 21:11.088
Data, on the
encryption device.

21:11.122 --> 21:12.222
What kind of data?

21:12.256 --> 21:13.423
Well, that we don't know.

21:13.457 --> 21:15.558
Different units belong
to various organizations.

21:15.592 --> 21:17.869
But, somehow, I doubt they
were interested in the payroll

21:17.894 --> 21:19.194
for the Cape Town ballet,

21:19.228 --> 21:21.396
or the University's
annual accounts.

21:21.430 --> 21:22.864
They might just
be interested

21:22.898 --> 21:26.000
in the security protocols
of a major defense contractor.

21:26.034 --> 21:27.935
ATAT Systems.

21:27.969 --> 21:31.038
Who's the main
man here, in Cape Town?

21:31.073 --> 21:32.506
Kenneth Bratton.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.876
- Did you say, "Bratton"?
- Yeah.

21:36.779 --> 21:38.913
You have our
attention, Sergeant.

21:41.150 --> 21:44.453
Chemical weapons
guy. Latif.

21:44.487 --> 21:46.021
Could be something.

22:25.089 --> 22:25.155
Mr. Bratton.

22:28.225 --> 22:31.194
Who are you people?
How did you get in here?

22:39.569 --> 22:40.703
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

22:40.737 --> 22:42.605
Lovely family, Ken.

22:44.574 --> 22:46.876
What have
you done with them?

22:48.545 --> 22:53.215
They're fine.
They'll be fine.

22:54.885 --> 22:56.152
What do you want?

22:56.186 --> 22:58.554
Oh, I think you know
exactly what I want.

23:15.072 --> 23:18.141
You know Bratton was captured
by the Republican Guard in Iraq?

23:18.175 --> 23:20.310
And, that, John Porter...
John Porter got him out.

23:20.344 --> 23:22.445
In February, 2003. No
weapons designer should have

23:22.470 --> 23:23.929
been anywhere near there.

23:24.015 --> 23:26.013
And that was about the
same time Scott was booted

23:26.038 --> 23:27.238
out of Delta Force.

23:28.119 --> 23:30.253
What if there's a connection?

23:30.287 --> 23:32.489
The man that got shot in
the face at the heist...

23:32.523 --> 23:33.689
May have been Hugo Lynch.

23:33.690 --> 23:34.991
A computer hacker that
worked with Connolly.

23:34.992 --> 23:36.426
Why?

23:36.460 --> 23:38.996
Because a new computer
hacker just came to town.

23:39.030 --> 23:41.364
An American know
as Julian Buckley.

23:41.399 --> 23:43.106
Wanted for cleaning
out the United Bank of

23:43.131 --> 23:44.331
Ireland two years ago.

23:44.402 --> 23:45.669
And he's been flagged?

23:45.703 --> 23:47.404
Mmm-hmm. By Interpol.

23:47.438 --> 23:49.776
In from Kinshasa. Paid for
his ticket in cash two

23:49.777 --> 23:50.937
hours before the flight.

23:50.942 --> 23:52.709
And you think he's a
replacement for Lynch?

23:52.744 --> 23:55.580
I think it's a
possibility, Colonel.

23:55.614 --> 23:57.753
I've tracked his hire
car to an address in

23:57.778 --> 23:58.978
the Bo-Kaap area.

24:00.753 --> 24:03.990
Colonel, I'd like to
volunteer to talk to Bratton.

24:04.024 --> 24:06.659
Volunteer?
Yes, Ma'am.

24:06.693 --> 24:08.160
No. Stonebridge?

24:09.696 --> 24:10.959
All right, I need you
guys out in the field.

24:10.984 --> 24:12.063
Finally.

24:12.064 --> 24:14.147
You're gonna be tracking a
man called Buckley.

24:15.199 --> 24:16.686
Sergeant Richmond
will brief you.

24:17.469 --> 24:19.803
I need you to go and see Bratton.
Okay.

24:19.838 --> 24:21.705
All right? Kid gloves.

24:23.941 --> 24:25.442
You have your orders.

24:44.831 --> 24:47.165
You know, I'm the one that
should be talking to Bratton.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.600
Now's not the time.

24:48.634 --> 24:51.136
Now's not the time.

24:51.170 --> 24:52.837
Well, let me remind you
of something, buddy.

24:52.872 --> 24:54.057
I'm the guy that got
kicked out of the army for

24:54.060 --> 24:55.260
something that I did not do...

24:55.307 --> 24:57.171
And pricks like Bratton are
out there playing, "Hide the

24:57.196 --> 24:58.424
fucking chemical weapons."

24:58.677 --> 24:59.777
You don't know that.

24:59.811 --> 25:01.946
I do know that.

25:01.980 --> 25:03.737
There's something else
I know. I got screwed

25:03.762 --> 25:04.962
over in Iraq, by someone.

25:05.050 --> 25:06.584
I wanna find them.
I wanna kill them.

25:06.618 --> 25:07.919
I thought you were with
me on that one?

25:07.953 --> 25:09.721
Yeah, I just think, maybe,

25:09.755 --> 25:11.623
you're letting your personal life
get in the way of this mission.

25:11.657 --> 25:13.091
Personal life?

25:14.260 --> 25:16.294
That's fucking funny,
coming from you.

25:16.329 --> 25:18.664
What are you talking about?

25:18.698 --> 25:20.099
I'll tell you what I'm
talking about, Michael.

25:20.133 --> 25:21.400
If you wanna play hide
the sausage with Kate...

25:21.434 --> 25:22.902
Oh, that's genius
coming from you!

25:22.936 --> 25:25.471
You have no fucking clue
what you're talking about.

25:25.506 --> 25:27.274
Prick.

25:27.308 --> 25:28.575
Asshole.

25:32.446 --> 25:33.679
That's him.

25:33.714 --> 25:36.248
I've never been so glad to
see a terrorist in my life.

26:10.116 --> 26:12.250
Thank you for
seeing me so quickly.

26:12.284 --> 26:13.385
It's fine.

26:13.419 --> 26:14.719
I know the British
High Commission...

26:14.754 --> 26:17.589
Isn't in the business of
wasting people's time.

26:17.623 --> 26:19.090
And you're
here as a...?

26:19.125 --> 26:21.493
Criminal Intelligence liaison
with the South African police.

26:21.527 --> 26:22.728
Right.

26:22.762 --> 26:24.997
Uh, Miss Marshall,
this is Darin Morgan.

26:25.031 --> 26:26.064
Pleasure.

26:26.099 --> 26:27.265
You're with ATAT?

26:27.300 --> 26:29.468
He's our military consultant.

26:30.636 --> 26:32.737
Just oiling the
wheels, that's all.

26:34.307 --> 26:36.307
If you'd like to
come through...

26:43.214 --> 26:45.649
Thank you for your concern.

26:45.683 --> 26:47.317
As a result of the robbery...

26:47.352 --> 26:49.026
I've already requested
that our security codes

26:49.027 --> 26:50.054
are changed immediately.

26:50.055 --> 26:52.161
Well, if I can advise
you, sir, I do think you

26:52.186 --> 26:53.386
need to be careful.

26:53.693 --> 26:55.594
Of course.

26:55.628 --> 26:58.964
Have you had any
contact with this man?

26:58.998 --> 27:00.132
No. Who is he?

27:00.200 --> 27:01.700
His name is Daniel Connolly.

27:01.735 --> 27:04.870
We believe he may be allied
with a terrorist called Latif.

27:04.905 --> 27:06.739
He's the one who attacked
the hotel in India.

27:06.774 --> 27:08.863
His stated aim is to attack
the West with a weapon of

27:08.864 --> 27:09.909
mass destruction.

27:09.910 --> 27:12.244
Well, he's looking
in the wrong place.

27:12.279 --> 27:15.280
We design weapon systems here
but we don't house them.

27:15.315 --> 27:17.353
That would be against
South African law. And

27:17.378 --> 27:18.578
we're very scrupulous.

27:21.053 --> 27:22.486
Your family not around?

27:22.521 --> 27:25.623
No, school holidays.
They're at our beach house.

27:25.657 --> 27:26.957
Sounds nice.

27:26.991 --> 27:29.760
Hmm. Yeah, it is.

27:35.700 --> 27:38.330
I appreciate the
offer, but really my security

27:38.355 --> 27:39.555
is more than adequate.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.475
I understand you were
in Iraq, before the invasion.

27:43.509 --> 27:44.742
Yeah, that's right.

27:44.777 --> 27:46.111
Doing what, might I ask?

27:46.178 --> 27:48.513
I was asked to report on
Saddam's weapons stock.

27:48.548 --> 27:50.515
Which was non-existent?

27:50.550 --> 27:54.019
Well, he fooled
cleverer men than me.

27:58.358 --> 27:59.859
It's my card.

28:01.361 --> 28:02.528
Thank you.

28:14.643 --> 28:19.514
She's military.
What did she want?

28:19.549 --> 28:23.452
Uh, something about the,
uh, bank job robbery.

28:23.486 --> 28:26.155
And, what's that got
to do with Iraq?

28:26.189 --> 28:27.389
I don't know.

28:28.591 --> 28:30.892
Let me speak to a
contact in Whitehall.

28:30.926 --> 28:33.927
I'll find out where she's
from and get them to back off.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.164
We don't want
any trouble, Ken.

28:52.614 --> 28:54.415
What the fuck is going on?

29:06.463 --> 29:08.430
Fuck, I think he made us.

29:08.465 --> 29:10.332
No, he didn't make us.

29:11.802 --> 29:14.470
Shit. He made us.
Move, move, move!

29:14.504 --> 29:16.205
Go around, buddy!

29:17.907 --> 29:20.975
Move, move!

29:25.847 --> 29:28.716
Stop! Stop!

29:32.021 --> 29:34.990
Stay down!
Stay down, now!

29:35.024 --> 29:37.759
Stay down! Fuck!

29:54.112 --> 29:56.880
Fuck!

29:56.914 --> 29:59.749
Someone call an ambulance!

30:08.792 --> 30:10.026
Get down!

30:15.367 --> 30:18.169
Move, fucking move!

30:20.606 --> 30:22.106
Fucker!

30:30.382 --> 30:32.282
Get out of the way!

30:32.316 --> 30:34.418
What
the fuck are you doing, man?

31:17.997 --> 31:20.065
Michael, get a medic!

31:20.100 --> 31:22.968
Fuck!

31:28.509 --> 31:30.676
Yeah?

31:30.710 --> 31:32.745
You were supposed to
call 20 minutes ago.

31:32.779 --> 31:34.880
Yeah, I'm here now, huh.

31:34.914 --> 31:36.715
<i>The Kimberly Hotel.</i>

31:36.749 --> 31:41.119
<i>Be there in 10 minutes, no</i>
<i>weapons, or the deal's off.</i>

31:41.154 --> 31:43.855
Kimberly Hotel,
10 minutes, got it.

31:52.931 --> 31:54.765
Don't worry about that.
Come on, come on, come on.

31:59.569 --> 32:03.238
Bring that up.

32:03.272 --> 32:05.606
Colonel Grant, you
wanted to speak to me?

32:05.641 --> 32:08.352
When you met with Kenneth
Bratton did you, at any point,

32:08.377 --> 32:09.877
intimate that he was lying?

32:09.945 --> 32:12.146
Certainly not. Although
I'm fairly certain he was.

32:12.181 --> 32:13.716
Well, he's put in a
complaint about you,

32:13.741 --> 32:14.941
and wants you to back off.

32:15.550 --> 32:16.750
What does the
Ministry say?

32:16.785 --> 32:18.452
Well, they're all
twitchy aren't they?

32:18.487 --> 32:20.533
ATAT's one of the
largest publicly-traded

32:20.558 --> 32:21.656
companies in the U.K.

32:21.657 --> 32:24.259
Yes, and Connolly
is targeting them.

32:24.293 --> 32:25.793
He should be as concerned
about that as we are.

32:25.828 --> 32:27.329
Then, why isn't he?

32:27.363 --> 32:29.765
Excuse me. Stonebridge and Scott
need to speak to you urgently.

32:31.935 --> 32:33.336
<i>Colonel, Buckley's down...</i>

32:33.370 --> 32:35.438
<i>And Scott's going</i>
<i>to take his identity.</i>

32:35.473 --> 32:36.673
Run that by me, again.

32:36.707 --> 32:38.876
Scott took a call
on Buckley's phone.

32:38.910 --> 32:40.878
Yeah, the bloke heard
an American accent,

32:40.912 --> 32:42.447
<i>must've thought</i>
<i>it was Buckley.</i>

32:42.481 --> 32:44.115
Yeah, 'cause we all
sound the same, right?

32:44.150 --> 32:45.960
And you're seriously
suggesting Scott goes in

32:45.985 --> 32:47.185
there as Buckley, unarmed?

32:47.553 --> 32:50.555
That's right. The only thing is,
he has 10 minutes to get there.

32:50.590 --> 32:52.624
How do we know Connolly
won't recognize Buckley?

32:52.658 --> 32:55.693
He had half a torn playing
card, in his pocket.

32:55.728 --> 32:56.995
We just don't think he will.

32:57.029 --> 32:59.597
There's also the fact that
Buckley's an expert hacker.

32:59.632 --> 33:01.399
What's she saying?

33:01.433 --> 33:02.968
Well, I can brief
him in Cyber Ops.

33:03.002 --> 33:04.569
In ten minutes?
On the phone?

33:04.604 --> 33:06.838
Well, the alternative is
we surround the building.

33:06.872 --> 33:08.707
Bring his contact in
for interrogation.

33:08.741 --> 33:11.209
Yeah, but if we do that,
Connolly's in the wind.

33:13.346 --> 33:15.013
Put Scott on.

33:15.047 --> 33:16.248
Scott.

33:18.384 --> 33:19.985
Yeah?

33:20.019 --> 33:21.686
I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

33:21.721 --> 33:23.488
Yeah, I'm listening.

33:23.523 --> 33:25.390
Patch this through.

33:37.170 --> 33:40.005
No, Colonel, I've got
his file in my hand.

33:56.256 --> 33:57.890
It's a green light, buddy.

34:11.436 --> 34:13.771
And she's
Irish, is she?

34:13.806 --> 34:17.108
Kate Marshall.
Captain Kate Marshall.

34:17.143 --> 34:19.077
She's British Army
intelligence.

34:21.648 --> 34:24.150
Darling, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

34:25.853 --> 34:27.719
We have a contact at the
Ministry of Defense in London.

34:27.755 --> 34:32.592
She's assigned to some special
tactical unit. Led by...

34:34.728 --> 34:37.263
Colonel Eleanor Grant.

34:40.902 --> 34:43.603
Look, I'm telling
you everything I know.

34:43.638 --> 34:45.272
I'm cooperating
with you completely.

34:45.306 --> 34:47.674
I just want to know that my
family are going to be safe.

34:55.114 --> 34:57.016
This'll soon be over, Ken.

34:58.120 --> 35:00.354
I have a good
feeling about this.

35:00.388 --> 35:03.624
It's all going
to end perfectly.

35:25.815 --> 35:27.849
We're late.

35:27.884 --> 35:29.851
Yeah, well...

35:29.886 --> 35:32.755
He doesn't show up, I'll
just have myself a drink.

35:32.789 --> 35:34.390
If I hear gunfire,
I'll come help.

35:34.425 --> 35:38.494
Don't worry yourself, buddy.
You hear gunfire, I'll be dead.

35:39.930 --> 35:43.366
Here, that's mine.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.068
I got Buckley's.

36:03.688 --> 36:06.323
Can I grab a Laphroaig
on the rocks, please?

36:06.358 --> 36:07.525
La-what?

36:07.559 --> 36:08.959
Laphroaig, uh...

36:08.993 --> 36:12.062
Just give him a scotch. Neat.

36:13.765 --> 36:16.500
Thanks, what
are you drinking?

36:18.403 --> 36:20.170
Same.

36:20.204 --> 36:21.938
Can you make that two?

36:34.318 --> 36:37.153
Fuck me, that taste like...
Shite. Yeah.

36:37.187 --> 36:38.454
Everything here is.

36:38.488 --> 36:42.424
Well, I don't
know about that.

36:42.458 --> 36:44.959
Quite a lovely Irish
accent going on, huh?

36:44.994 --> 36:46.661
Thank you.

36:46.695 --> 36:50.665
You, uh, you
meeting someone?

36:50.699 --> 36:53.434
Yeah. You.

36:56.439 --> 36:58.473
There's a room upstairs.

37:00.810 --> 37:02.644
Want to see it?

37:30.141 --> 37:32.208
Take your clothes off.

37:34.845 --> 37:36.612
What's the matter?

37:36.646 --> 37:39.615
I'm just wondering whether
you're going to fuck me or kill me.

37:39.649 --> 37:41.149
Take them off, and
you'll find out.

37:45.588 --> 37:46.721
What about you?

37:46.755 --> 37:49.257
Good things come
to those who wait.

37:52.695 --> 37:54.663
Is that a promise?

37:59.736 --> 38:00.870
Well?

38:00.904 --> 38:02.105
Turn around.

38:08.045 --> 38:09.713
Do I get the part?

38:12.884 --> 38:14.550
You sure do.

38:18.655 --> 38:20.756
Who's that?
A friend.

38:20.790 --> 38:23.525
I love a threesome.

38:23.559 --> 38:25.860
That's not the kind of
threesome I was talking about.

38:25.894 --> 38:27.895
What's wrong? Not
pretty enough for you?

38:27.930 --> 38:30.832
Fuck, no! Ahh...

38:42.313 --> 38:43.981
Shit.

39:15.644 --> 39:18.513
I'm looking for a friend
of mine. Big guy. American.

39:18.547 --> 39:20.147
Upstairs.

39:50.614 --> 39:52.581
<i>Scott's been taken, I'm in pursuit.</i>

39:52.616 --> 39:56.051
<i>Charlie one is a gray-panel</i>
<i>van heading north.</i>

39:56.086 --> 39:57.286
Checking coordinates.

39:58.355 --> 40:00.123
Bringing you onto visual.

40:01.259 --> 40:02.659
We've got you.

40:02.693 --> 40:04.094
Zero one, do you
have eyes on the van?

40:04.128 --> 40:06.497
Negative, I have no
visual of Charlie one.

40:06.531 --> 40:08.632
We're trying to track
Scott by his cell phone.

40:08.666 --> 40:11.268
That's not gonna work! Scott
gave me his cell phone!

40:11.302 --> 40:13.470
He took Buckley's with him.

40:13.504 --> 40:15.022
<i>I have two exits up ahead.</i>

40:15.047 --> 40:16.247
<i>Muizenberg or the airport?</i>

40:16.674 --> 40:19.008
Julia, do you hear me?
Muizenberg or airport?

40:19.042 --> 40:20.843
Satellite locked
on Charlie one. Switching.

40:20.877 --> 40:22.978
<i>Two exits there. Which one?</i>
<i>Muizenberg or the airport? Talk to me.</i>

40:23.012 --> 40:24.613
Exit 26.
Muizenberg.

40:24.647 --> 40:26.114
You've got them. They're right
there with you. Right there!

40:26.148 --> 40:28.249
Shit!

40:28.284 --> 40:30.273
<i>Charlie one</i>
<i>is in the wind. I repeat,</i>

40:30.298 --> 40:31.498
<i>Charlie one is in the wind.</i>

40:32.788 --> 40:33.855
Shit.

40:35.058 --> 40:37.426
Satellite
uplink's been lost.

40:42.933 --> 40:46.136
The accepted wisdom is that,
whoever's in charge in Egypt...

40:46.170 --> 40:50.374
In Libya, wherever, there's
always opportunities.

40:51.743 --> 40:54.344
My enemy's
enemy is my friend.

40:55.413 --> 40:57.180
Should be our
company motto.

40:59.450 --> 41:01.717
You all right
there, Ken?

41:01.752 --> 41:03.853
Of course.

41:03.887 --> 41:06.121
"My enemy's enemy
is my friend."

41:07.390 --> 41:09.725
If there was a problem,
you'd tell me, right?

41:09.759 --> 41:11.393
You'd be the first.

41:39.391 --> 41:41.793
Mr. Buckley,
I presume.

41:50.303 --> 41:52.704
I liked her welcome
much better.

41:52.738 --> 41:53.905
You were late.

41:53.940 --> 41:55.173
I was followed.

41:55.208 --> 41:56.374
Oh yeah? By who?

41:56.409 --> 41:57.609
How the fuck should I know?

42:00.279 --> 42:03.314
See, the thing is...

42:03.348 --> 42:08.385
I have a unit of British military
intelligence looking for me.

42:08.420 --> 42:10.688
Section 20...

42:12.190 --> 42:13.357
Good for you.

42:13.392 --> 42:17.062
It's headed by a woman
called Eleanor Grant.

42:17.096 --> 42:19.031
Do you know her?

42:19.065 --> 42:21.967
No. I don't know her.

42:24.705 --> 42:26.175
See, back in the day,
she used to send

42:26.200 --> 42:27.400
pricks just like you...

42:30.176 --> 42:31.443
To kill me.

42:31.477 --> 42:33.779
Do you want my fucking
services or not?

42:33.813 --> 42:36.080
Oh, yes, I do,
very much.

42:39.351 --> 42:41.619
But you're not
Julian Buckley.

42:48.726 --> 42:50.894
You're a fucking liar.

42:54.099 --> 42:59.237
And fucking liars like you
all get the same treatment...

43:11.851 --> 43:16.321
Fuck. Fuck.

43:17.723 --> 43:19.524
Fuck you!

43:22.093 --> 43:25.328
Last coordinates were down
in the valley. Laurensford.

43:25.363 --> 43:26.930
It's farm country.

43:26.964 --> 43:29.432
All right, it's open country,
proceed with caution.

43:29.466 --> 43:30.433
Do you understand?

43:30.467 --> 43:31.835
<i>Roger that.</i>

43:45.582 --> 43:46.782
Shit.

44:05.902 --> 44:08.470
Fuck. Shit.

44:33.731 --> 44:34.931
Eyes on Charlie One.

44:39.470 --> 44:41.572
Fuck me!

45:06.466 --> 45:08.000
Stonebridge, report.

45:26.818 --> 45:28.018
Fuck.

45:36.928 --> 45:38.329
Fuck!

45:44.269 --> 45:47.738
Fuck you! Fuck!

45:55.580 --> 45:57.581
Fucking...!

46:15.267 --> 46:16.567
Sergeant, report!

46:16.601 --> 46:17.935
Fuck you!

46:17.969 --> 46:19.203
That was Scott.

46:20.738 --> 46:23.406
I'm going in.

46:23.441 --> 46:24.440
Jesus!

46:24.475 --> 46:26.042
<i>Fuck.</i>
