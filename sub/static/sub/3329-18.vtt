WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:04.625
Whew! I'm beginning to think

00:04.670 --> 00:08.060
that some clients aren't
worth the 20 feet in the cold.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.308
Maybe it's time to un-nail
that basement door, huh?

00:14.240 --> 00:16.208
That's the
sex blanket.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.104
I have asked you
not to call it that.

00:18.150 --> 00:20.778
Who is she and what time
IS she coming over?

00:20.820 --> 00:22.685
How would you like to spend
the next three days

00:22.720 --> 00:25.041
at the Hotel Lutece,
enjoying the finest pampering

00:25.090 --> 00:27.411
that Western civilization
has to offer? On me,

00:27.460 --> 00:29.223
of course.
Already booked you a room.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.682
Actually, it's the least
I could do, considering

00:30.730 --> 00:32.197
as I was about _
to request-slash-adVIse

00:32.230 --> 00:33.652
that you make yourself
scarce for a few days.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.156
A few days?

00:35.200 --> 00:37.259
Her name-- to answer
your Initial question--

00:37.300 --> 00:39.495
is Agatha Spurrell.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.429
She's an esteemed
British climatologist.

00:42.470 --> 00:45.109
She's in New York to deliver the
keynote at a global conference.

00:45.140 --> 00:47.779
We met several years ago,
when she was consulting Father

00:47.810 --> 00:50.370
_ on a_land deal
In the BraZIIIan rain forest.

00:50.410 --> 00:52.469
At about the same time,
I was investigating a man

00:52.520 --> 00:54.215
who'd thrown his wife
in the Splugen Pass

00:54.250 --> 00:56.480
in the Swiss Alps. Agatha

00:56.520 --> 00:58.818
helped to prove that visibility
was quite good on the day

00:58.850 --> 01:01.080
in question, and that
the wife's death was not

01:01.120 --> 01:04.351
the accident that the husband
claimed it to be.

01:04.390 --> 01:06.790
She's proven herself quite
useful on a number of occasions.

01:06.830 --> 01:09.219
And we also find ourselves

01:09.270 --> 01:10.862
compatible in matters
of the flesh.

01:10.900 --> 01:13.368
Wait, are you cleaning up?

01:13.400 --> 01:16.608
Do not mistake caution
for sentiment, Watson.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.733
I'm just moving a few
breakables out of the way--

01:18.770 --> 01:20.135
some rare volumes.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.636
We do have a tendency to...
spread out.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.568
I'm impressed.

01:23.610 --> 01:26.272
A sex partner you're not kicking
out the minute you're done.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.538
But... mixing pleasure
with an irregular?

01:28.580 --> 01:30.241
It seems a little risky,

01:30.290 --> 01:31.541
you know?

01:31.590 --> 01:34.218
Agatha is not
your regular irregular.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.251
_ We_both have the mental
dlSClpllne to compartmentalize.

01:36.290 --> 01:38.383
Anyway,
I'm having the woman

01:38.430 --> 01:40.227
over for her benefit, not mine;
there's a good deal

01:40.260 --> 01:42.262
of pressure
surrounding her speech.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.723
I merely offer myself sexually
to help her de-stress.

01:44.770 --> 01:47.136
And I will take the hotel.

01:47.170 --> 01:49.365
I'm gonna go pack.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.431
*

02:14.300 --> 02:16.393
(loud thump)

02:20.370 --> 02:22.361
You got to be
kidding me.

02:24.810 --> 02:27.233
What the hell, man?!

02:34.250 --> 02:36.286
(tires screeching)

02:36.320 --> 02:37.685
No! No!

02:37.720 --> 02:39.711
(groaning)

02:42.730 --> 02:44.721
(engine rewing)

02:44.760 --> 02:46.625
No! Wait, no!

02:46.660 --> 02:48.196
(screams)

03:21.600 --> 03:23.522
Even you cannot deny the
hypocrisy-- the world's elite

03:23.570 --> 03:27.392
swarming into the city via their
private jets and luxury SUVs

03:27.440 --> 03:29.567
to decry the dangers
of global warming.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.862
Celebrity is a
microphone, Sherlock.

03:31.910 --> 03:34.799
People like that will fly
their private jets regardless.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.446
Better they put their privilege
to good use, don't you think?

03:38.480 --> 03:39.640
Wailing Goggle Man alone

03:39.680 --> 03:41.545
must burn enough fuel in a year

03:41.580 --> 03:42.740
to send a rocket to Mars.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.519
Wailing Goggle Man?

03:44.550 --> 03:46.654
Yeah, you know,
the Irishman with the songs.

03:46.690 --> 03:49.579
Bono. His name is Bono.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.621
(phone ringing)

03:53.530 --> 03:55.521
Detective?

03:57.970 --> 04:00.768
I'll inform Watson, and we'll
meet you there presently.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.530
You must forgive me.

04:03.570 --> 04:05.606
Duty calls. You have a key.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.801
The brownstone is yours
to come and go as you please.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.001
Actually, I was hoping we could
discuss something this morning.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.348
My schedule's so full
for the rest of the week,

04:12.380 --> 04:13.938
I'm not sure we'll
get another chance.

04:13.980 --> 04:17.347
I promise I won't
take long.

04:20.860 --> 04:23.488
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

04:23.530 --> 04:26.397
Hey, where you been?

04:26.430 --> 04:29.399
Stalled train. I take it
that's the lion's share

04:29.430 --> 04:31.489
of the crime scene
being carted off.

04:31.530 --> 04:33.498
It's going to the garage
at the precinct.

04:33.540 --> 04:34.962
The body's on its way
to the morgue.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.831
_ This street feeds
right Into the tunnel.

04:36.870 --> 04:38.804
IfI had held the scene
anylongen

04:38.840 --> 04:41.001
we'd be getting calls
from the mayor's office.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.645
The victim's name was
Galen Barrow-- 26.

04:43.680 --> 04:46.342
He was a driver for one of those
ride-sharing companies.

04:46.380 --> 04:49.042
Zooss? It's like the Greek god,
but with two Os and two 55.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.480
The dot-com mavens will not rest

04:51.520 --> 04:53.579
until every word
has been mangled.

04:53.620 --> 04:54.848
That's "word" with one "0."

04:54.890 --> 04:57.051
Looks like the killer
was driving a yellow cab.

04:57.090 --> 04:58.557
Paint transfer
all over the Victim's car.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.898
Multiple impacts--

04:59.930 --> 05:01.420
no way this was
an accident.

05:01.460 --> 05:03.098
BELL: There has been
a lot of tension between

05:03.130 --> 05:04.529
the cabbies
and the ride-sharing guys

05:04.570 --> 05:05.867
the last few months.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.868
Some bar fights,
a few other tangles,

05:07.900 --> 05:10.664
but, far as I can tell,
this is the first murder.

05:14.010 --> 05:16.001
(mutters)

05:22.020 --> 05:24.011
(sniffles)

05:46.010 --> 05:48.035
(Holmes sniffing)

05:50.650 --> 05:52.811
Smell that.
The pavement?

05:52.850 --> 05:55.739
Vomit.
That doesn't look like puke.

05:55.780 --> 05:58.715
That's because the vomiter was
drinking on an empty stomach.

05:58.750 --> 05:59.910
(sniffs)

05:59.960 --> 06:02.451
Gin. A particularly
cheap brand of gin

06:02.490 --> 06:04.549
called Pascal's.
You can tell

06:04.590 --> 06:06.649
from the distinct blend
of impurities and flavorings.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.759
I'll take your word for it.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.597
So you think the
killer threw up.

06:10.630 --> 06:13.064
Leaning out of the driver's seat
would leave him about there.

06:13.100 --> 06:16.900
Yeah. I saw
an empty bottle of Pascal's

06:16.940 --> 06:18.669
on the curb around the corner.

06:18.710 --> 06:20.598
Hadn't been there for very long.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.076
Could be the cabbie threw it out
the window after he did this.

06:24.110 --> 06:25.771
I'll have our guys bag it

06:25.810 --> 06:27.812
and get a swab of that.
(phone chirps)

06:31.750 --> 06:33.718
The department
reached out to the TLC

06:33.760 --> 06:35.648
to try to find out if any cabs

06:35.690 --> 06:37.851
came in with front-_end
damage this morning.

06:37.890 --> 06:40.791
Looks like we got a hit
at a fleet in Queens.

06:40.830 --> 06:44.425
MAN: Driver said
he lost control on some ice

06:44.470 --> 06:45.789
and hit a pole.

06:45.830 --> 06:48.765
He brought it in like
this at around 6:00.

06:50.770 --> 06:54.638
Well... I'd say
he's telling the truth.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.808
Uh, the car we're looking for
would be more banged-up,

06:57.850 --> 07:00.512
but we appreciate you
letting us take a look.

07:00.550 --> 07:01.710
I wish your guys
said on the phone

07:01.750 --> 07:03.638
that someone
killed a Zooss driver.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.840
I'd have saved
you the trip.
Why is that?

07:05.890 --> 07:08.984
The driver did this--
name's Rasheed.

07:09.020 --> 07:11.523
He leases by the week and
sends everything he makes

07:11.560 --> 07:13.198
back to his family
in Bangladesh.

07:13.230 --> 07:15.528
Guys like that
don't care about Zooss

07:15.560 --> 07:17.699
or Goober or whatever
they're called.

07:17.730 --> 07:20.665
Fleet hacks aren't having
any trouble picking up fares.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.804
All right, then
who is upset about Zooss?

07:22.840 --> 07:25.809
If you ask me, you're
looking for a private owner.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.979
A guy who took out a
mortgage to buy a medallion,

07:28.010 --> 07:30.570
and that cab is how
he puts food on the table.

07:30.610 --> 07:33.249
Those medallions cost,
what, a million dollars now?

07:33.280 --> 07:35.043
They did,
but the price is going down

07:35.080 --> 07:36.616
thanks to
the ride-share companies.

07:36.650 --> 07:37.844
In other cities,
it's already bad,

07:37.890 --> 07:39.710
and people here see
the writing on the wall.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.887
It's like the market for
your house dropping out.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.785
A lot of these guys,

07:43.830 --> 07:46.048
they're up to their eyeballs
in debt, and now...

07:46.090 --> 07:48.058
they're underwater.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.795
I'd kill over that.

07:52.230 --> 07:55.836
BELL: Hey. Thought you'd
still be at the morgue.

07:55.870 --> 07:57.906
Mr. Barrow's body
was a disappointment.

07:57.940 --> 08:00.238
It was devoid of any clues
as to his killer's identity,

08:00.280 --> 08:02.077
so I came here.

08:02.110 --> 08:04.249
Your trip to the fleet was,
of course, equally fruitless.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.510
And how did you know that?

08:09.820 --> 08:12.084
This is a chrome bumper strip.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.815
It is not from
Galen Barrow's car,

08:13.860 --> 08:16.522
but rather from the cab--
a Ford Crown Victoria.

08:16.560 --> 08:17.822
It became wedged
into the wreckage

08:17.860 --> 08:19.999
and then pulled off
as the cab backed away.

08:20.030 --> 08:22.863
It's significant
because the last model year

08:22.900 --> 08:26.734
when Ford Crown Victorias had
chrome bumper strips was 2003.

08:26.770 --> 08:28.169
Would you
care to guess

08:28.200 --> 08:30.805
how many active yellow cabs
are Ford Crown Victorias

08:30.840 --> 08:32.307
manufactured in 2003 or earlier?

08:32.340 --> 08:35.207
Something tells me
you already checked.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.949
Five. And all of them
have been accounted for.

08:38.980 --> 08:41.710
I don't understand.
Are you saying It wasn't a cab?

08:41.750 --> 08:44.583
Not an active cab, no.
But a retired one?

08:44.620 --> 08:46.713
The dispatcher we talked to
thought the perp

08:46.760 --> 08:49.115
might be a private owner,
someone who was still driving.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.718
I'm beginning to think
the killer

08:50.760 --> 08:52.022
is not a cab driver at all.

08:53.030 --> 08:54.190
The attack happened
when Galen Barrow

08:54.230 --> 08:55.857
was beginning his shift.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.266
That's a predictable time
and place to find him.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.768
The killer was driving
a more than decade-old

09:00.800 --> 09:03.109
_ retired cab--
a vehicle whose presence

09:03.140 --> 09:05.665
is far less likely
if left to chance.

09:05.710 --> 09:08.270
So you think someone killed
Barrow for another reason,

09:08.310 --> 09:11.006
but then wanted it to look like
it was an angry cab driver.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.712
It's a possibility I think
we should at least explore.

09:13.750 --> 09:16.014
If it's true, it stands
to reason that the killer

09:16.050 --> 09:19.588
acquired that vehicle
expressly for the task,

09:19.620 --> 09:21.110
so you should refocus
your search to identify

09:21.160 --> 09:22.889
recently-sold cabs that match

09:22.930 --> 09:26.081
the aforementioned make
and years of production.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.223
I'll pull the sales records
and let you know what I find.

09:28.260 --> 09:31.320
I'll attempt to gather
information about Mr. Barrow.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.691
We can meet later at the
brownstone to review it.

09:33.740 --> 09:37.130
Uh, what about Agatha?
All that de-stressing?

09:37.170 --> 09:40.799
I think a homicide
takes precedence, don't you?

09:49.150 --> 09:51.118
Oh, you must be Agatha.

09:51.150 --> 09:53.618
And you must be Joan.
Oh, no, no, please, sit.

09:53.660 --> 09:56.083
I was hoping we'd
cross paths at some point.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.656
When Sherlock told me
he'd exiled you

09:57.690 --> 10:00.090
on my account,
I was mortified.

10:00.130 --> 10:02.098
If the Lutece is exile,
I will take it. Anyway,

10:02.130 --> 10:04.667
he's making up for it with
the crme brle bill alone.

10:04.700 --> 10:07.237
But I promise you I will be out
of your hair before you know it.

10:07.270 --> 10:10.728
Oh... he's made too much
of that, I'm afraid.

10:10.770 --> 10:12.260
We're not teenagers.

10:12.310 --> 10:13.675
At any rate,

10:13.710 --> 10:15.405
no need to rush.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.670
Sherlock's too busy to socialize
tonight-- busy with the case.

10:17.710 --> 10:19.246
Is he here?

10:19.280 --> 10:21.271
He said he'd be
in the office if I need him.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.015
The office.

10:23.050 --> 10:24.847
The one downstairs
in the basement?

10:29.120 --> 10:30.382
Are you hiding?

10:30.430 --> 10:32.386
Excuse me?

10:32.430 --> 10:34.751
Are you hiding here
in my office?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.995
From Agatha.

10:37.030 --> 10:39.828
As you are well aware,
I find changes in environment

10:39.870 --> 10:42.031
conducive to my process.
And what reason

10:42.070 --> 10:44.436
could I possibly have
for hiding from my own guest?

10:44.470 --> 10:46.108
I don't know.

10:46.140 --> 10:49.029
Adhering to my theory
that Galen Barrow's murder

10:49.080 --> 10:51.799
is not related
to the Livery War of 2015,

10:51.850 --> 10:54.318
I began to look
at other aspects of his life.

10:54.350 --> 10:56.147
As it turns out,

10:56.180 --> 10:58.444
Internet journalist
was his vocation of choice.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.708
Only started driving for Zooss
a couple of months ago,

11:00.760 --> 11:02.387
probably to supplement
the paltry sums

11:02.420 --> 11:04.684
he was paid for his blogs. What?

11:04.730 --> 11:07.949
You are totally
hiding from her.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.935
Something happened this morning.

11:12.970 --> 11:16.758
Agatha made a rather...
imposing request of me.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.938
She wants to make it official.
I knew it.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.333
I knew it was only
a matter of time

11:21.380 --> 11:23.200
before one of these women
fell in love With you.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.740
You cannot maintain multiple

11:24.780 --> 11:26.714
long-term physical
relationships

11:26.750 --> 11:28.741
without one of them turning
serious. I don't care how good

11:28.780 --> 11:30.145
you think you are at
compartmentalizing...

11:30.190 --> 11:32.988
Agatha is not in love with me.

11:33.020 --> 11:36.114
Oh. Then what's
the problem?

11:36.160 --> 11:38.958
She's asked for a donation.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.355
What, to an
environmental group?

11:40.400 --> 11:42.698
To her uterus.

11:43.930 --> 11:48.435
She has asked for my... issue.

11:48.470 --> 11:50.961
She wants to have a baby
with you?

11:51.010 --> 11:52.978
She's asked only
for my genetic material.

11:53.010 --> 11:55.808
Her expectation as to my
involvement in the child's life

11:55.840 --> 11:57.478
would end there.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.148
What did you say?

11:59.180 --> 12:02.445
Do I exude the traits
of fatherhood to you?

12:02.480 --> 12:05.381
(phone ringing)

12:05.420 --> 12:07.149
Detective.

12:07.190 --> 12:09.454
BELL: Well, that suggestion
of yours paid off.

12:09.490 --> 12:12.152
We looked into recent sales
of retired yellow cabs

12:12.190 --> 12:15.398
and found an '03 Crown Vic
that traded hands last week.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.398
A couple of detectives
went to the buyer's house

12:17.430 --> 12:19.990
to check it out; guy told them
it had been stolen.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.996
And his reason
for not reporting the theft?

12:22.040 --> 12:23.439
They asked him
the same question,

12:23.470 --> 12:26.337
and he tried
to bolt out the back door.

12:26.370 --> 12:29.271
They're bringing him down
to the station now.

12:30.810 --> 12:34.177
Gordon Meadows,
I'm Detective Bell.

12:34.220 --> 12:37.485
This is Mr. Holmes,
Ms. Watson.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.181
We've just been informed

12:39.220 --> 12:41.359
that you're a
registered sex offender.

12:41.390 --> 12:45.349
You were arrested for trading
in child pornography in 2008.

12:45.390 --> 12:49.451
We're curious. What's your
affiliation with Galen Barrow?

12:52.170 --> 12:55.560
Why'd you buy that taxi
last week?

12:55.600 --> 12:57.932
It was too old to put into use.

12:57.970 --> 13:01.133
I needed a car.

13:01.180 --> 13:04.274
And the price was right.

13:04.310 --> 13:06.505
And your reason
for running from the police?

13:09.380 --> 13:11.439
How long have you had
that irritation on your skin?

13:11.490 --> 13:13.856
I don't... I don't know.

13:13.890 --> 13:16.381
It's called
airbag dermatitis.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.183
Usually clears up
in a couple of days.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.448
Which means that you were
recently in the front of a car

13:20.500 --> 13:21.899
whose airbag deployed.

13:21.930 --> 13:24.364
BELL:
See, that's interesting.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.493
Especially considering
how Mr. Barrow died.

13:26.530 --> 13:28.134
We're also pretty sure

13:28.170 --> 13:30.138
whoever killed him
threw up at the scene.

13:30.170 --> 13:31.865
We're just waiting on the DNA.

13:31.910 --> 13:35.505
Your DNA's
already on file.

13:35.540 --> 13:38.907
So maybe it's time
you got out in front of this.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.545
I didn't have a choice.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.512
To do what?

13:46.520 --> 13:48.511
All of it.

13:48.560 --> 13:53.224
Buying the cab, driving
it into that man.

13:53.260 --> 13:55.228
They-they made me do it.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.626
I had to drink
a half a bottle of gin

13:57.670 --> 13:59.160
just to work up the courage.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.896
Are you saying you were coerced?

14:05.340 --> 14:09.970
A few months ago,
I started going to...

14:11.980 --> 14:13.311
...a schoolyard

14:13.350 --> 14:15.568
in, uh, Washington
Heights,

14:15.620 --> 14:19.010
somewhere where no one
would recognize me.

14:19.050 --> 14:21.518
I swear, I-I didn't
do anything.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.883
I just... I just wanted to look.

14:25.930 --> 14:28.990
_ But it was still
a Violation of your parole.

14:29.030 --> 14:32.591
I started getting texts.

14:32.630 --> 14:35.098
Photos of me

14:35.140 --> 14:36.493
at the school.

14:36.540 --> 14:38.667
Someone was blackmailing you.

14:38.710 --> 14:41.531
They said they wanted $5,000
or they would tell the police

14:41.580 --> 14:43.571
what I was doing.

14:43.610 --> 14:48.240
I knew that I would go back
to jail, s-so I paid.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.641
Everything was
quiet for a while.

14:52.690 --> 14:57.286
Then, a few days ago,
I get a new text.

14:57.330 --> 15:01.198
A picture of that
poor man, Barrow,

15:01.230 --> 15:03.460
with a bunch of
instructions.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.922
They were telling me

15:04.970 --> 15:09.464
where he would be,
when he would be there.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.503
That I had to use a cab.

15:14.410 --> 15:16.275
The cops who came
to my house,

15:16.310 --> 15:17.675
they have my phone.

15:17.710 --> 15:20.474
Look at it, please.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.978
It's all there.
You'll see.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.625
I'll have the
phone brought up,

15:31.660 --> 15:33.218
but that guy seems
pretty confident

15:33.260 --> 15:34.955
it's gonna back
his story.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.468
Seems unlikely he would have
preemptively fabricated evidence

15:37.500 --> 15:39.661
of a blackmailing
just in case he was arrested.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.258
So we might have caught
the killer,

15:41.300 --> 15:42.699
but someone else
wanted Barrow dead.

15:42.740 --> 15:45.436
He was just the weapon.

15:50.680 --> 15:53.342
WATSON: Mrs. Guerrero, Galen
Barrow was a regular writer

15:53.380 --> 15:55.371
for your Web site, wasn't he?

15:55.420 --> 15:58.344
It's such a shock
for everybody here.

15:58.390 --> 16:01.188
We're all still trying to get
our heads around what happened.

16:01.220 --> 16:02.983
The news said
it was a hit-and-run,

16:03.030 --> 16:05.225
but now you think
he was targeted?

16:05.260 --> 16:07.057
There is evidence that
supports that, yes.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.455
We have the driver in custody.
It looks like he was coerced.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.328
using burner phones.

16:13.370 --> 16:15.361
Those numbers are
no longer in use.

16:15.400 --> 16:18.506
(scoffs)
Everyone liked Galen.

16:18.540 --> 16:21.429
We didn't know much
about his personal life.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.278
Mostly, our contributors
work from home.

16:24.310 --> 16:26.107
But it's hard to imagine anyone

16:26.150 --> 16:27.742
wanting to hurt him.

16:27.780 --> 16:30.578
Is it possible that his work
here put him in harm's way?

16:30.620 --> 16:32.508
Perhaps during his research
for an article,

16:32.550 --> 16:34.211
he witnessed something untoward.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.388
Honestly,
he would have loved that.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.227
He was ambitious.

16:39.260 --> 16:40.352
He saw himself doing

16:40.400 --> 16:42.254
real investigative journalism
one day.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.564
Mostly what we had for him
was gallery openings,

16:44.600 --> 16:46.761
city council meetings.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.394
His last piece
was on craft beers.

16:49.440 --> 16:52.159
If you wouldn't mind, we'd like
to review his recent work.

16:52.210 --> 16:55.771
Oh, of course.
Anything I can do to help.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.444
Hmm, this might be something.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.378
A couple of months ago,
Galen interviewed

17:05.420 --> 17:08.059
a fashion designer
named Bobby Alacqua.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.057
Do not doubt my ability
to multitask.

17:12.090 --> 17:13.398
Bobby Alacqua.

17:13.430 --> 17:15.318
Might be something.
Well, the interview

17:15.360 --> 17:17.328
was just a puff piece,
but I recognized the name.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.689
There was an arrest
at his boutique last week.

17:18.730 --> 17:21.267
One of his employees
was trafficking cocaine

17:21.300 --> 17:23.109
and using the store as a front.

17:23.140 --> 17:25.358
So maybe Galen saw something
he shouldn't have.

17:25.410 --> 17:26.536
Yeah.

17:29.380 --> 17:31.575
So how'd it go here last night?

17:31.610 --> 17:35.410
Agatha and I did not have sex,
if that's what you're asking.

17:35.450 --> 17:38.180
Did you talk more?
About me helping
to create another human life?

17:38.220 --> 17:39.812
No, we did not.
Is it really so...

17:39.850 --> 17:41.351
Yes.
But I don't...

17:41.390 --> 17:43.255
What facet
of my being would suggest

17:43.290 --> 17:45.258
that I have any desire
to reproduce, hmm?

17:45.290 --> 17:46.723
Is it my optimistic outlook?

17:46.760 --> 17:48.557
Or perhaps the nostalgic fuzzies

17:48.600 --> 17:50.761
that you hear me spouting
about my own upbringing?

17:50.800 --> 17:52.392
Well, you're reading
about Agatha.

17:52.430 --> 17:54.091
She's obviously on your mind.

17:54.140 --> 17:56.529
I'm attempting to understand
what could have caused her

17:56.570 --> 17:59.130
to so egregiously violate
our sexual contract.

17:59.170 --> 18:00.398
Until last week,

18:00.440 --> 18:02.135
I hadn't seen her for months.

18:02.180 --> 18:03.670
So perhaps
she had a brush with death

18:03.710 --> 18:05.473
or suffered _
a traumatic brain injury.

18:05.510 --> 18:08.445
So now you have to have
brain damage to want a baby?

18:08.480 --> 18:09.617
Your words.

18:09.650 --> 18:11.845
Agatha's what, 36? 37?

18:11.890 --> 18:15.382
If you intend to reduce this
to some tired clock analogy...

18:15.420 --> 18:17.285
It's a thing. It happens.
If that's all this was,

18:17.330 --> 18:20.697
she could've gone to any number
of banks for her spermatozoa.

18:20.730 --> 18:23.324
Instead, she turned
to a confirmed misanthrope

18:23.370 --> 18:24.667
and recovering drug addict.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.635
I ask you, Watson, who
in their right mind

18:27.670 --> 18:31.333
would favor my genetic material
over...

18:31.370 --> 18:32.837
Yes?

18:32.870 --> 18:34.633
You were right.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.500
You should look into
that cocaine-et—couture shop

18:36.540 --> 18:37.643
you mentioned--
sounds promising.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.477
Where are you going?
Calls to make.

18:39.510 --> 18:41.842
Personal matter.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.484
Who dresses you, girl?

18:44.520 --> 18:46.613
(chuckles)
I dress myself.

18:46.650 --> 18:49.380
You ought to come work for me.
You had an employee

18:49.420 --> 18:52.150
who_was arrested here
for movmg drugs in the store.

18:52.190 --> 18:55.421
Riclq was a good worker.
Organized, self-starting.

18:55.460 --> 18:56.654
If it wasn't for the part
about him dealing coke,

18:56.700 --> 18:57.894
I'd have made
him manager.

18:57.930 --> 18:59.522
Anyway, I thought
he cut a deal.

18:59.570 --> 19:00.798
What else is there
to talk about?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.535
Actually, I was investigating
a different crime,

19:02.570 --> 19:04.231
but it might be related.

19:04.270 --> 19:06.807
There was a reporter named
Galen Barrow who interviewed you

19:06.840 --> 19:08.637
for this Web site
called TownSoNice.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.568
I remember. Cute.

19:10.610 --> 19:12.578
Was there any chance that he was
in contact with Riclq

19:12.610 --> 19:13.941
or any of Ricky's associates
while he was here?

19:13.980 --> 19:15.641
Nuh-uh. We didn't
meet here.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.545
I had some business uptown,
so we met at a coffee shop

19:17.590 --> 19:19.342
across the street
from his apartment.

19:19.390 --> 19:20.812
Uh, where uptown was this?

19:20.860 --> 19:23.454
First Avenue, in the 805.

19:23.490 --> 19:24.957
I can look it up.

19:24.990 --> 19:27.322
And you're sure
he said this was his apartment.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.952
That boy apologized
about a thousand times

19:29.000 --> 19:31.468
that he made me come to him;
and when we wrapped it up,

19:31.500 --> 19:34.389
I saw him go
into his building. Why?

19:38.540 --> 19:40.508
I received your texts.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.929
You invited Ms_. Guerrero in
for questioning?

19:42.980 --> 19:45.744
Galen interviewed Bobby Alacqua
on the Upper East Side,

19:45.780 --> 19:48.317
across from a building that
Galen said was his apartment.

19:48.350 --> 19:50.215
But then I remembered
he lived in Brooklyn.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.842
So you looked up the occupants,

19:51.890 --> 19:53.858
and you found the name
Lydia Guerrero.

19:53.890 --> 19:56.279
This morning,
she said she barely knew him.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.856
Obviously, that wasn't true.

19:57.890 --> 20:00.450
You think
they were playing couch quail?

20:00.500 --> 20:01.694
GREGSON: If that means
having an affair,

20:01.730 --> 20:03.698
yeah, we do.

20:03.730 --> 20:06.426
So, Lydia's married to a lawyer
at a big corporate firm.

20:06.470 --> 20:08.358
Compared to what she's
making at the Web site,

20:08.400 --> 20:09.833
he's definitely
the breadwinner.

20:09.870 --> 20:11.508
Leaves us with
a couple p055ibilities.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.508
Either the husband found out
about the affair

20:13.540 --> 20:15.269
and he arranged the hit
on Galen;

20:15.310 --> 20:18.370
or Galen threatened
to expose the affair,

20:18.410 --> 20:19.672
and Lydia set
up the hit.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.416
Either way, your visit
to her this morning

20:21.450 --> 20:22.849
must have rattled her,

20:22.880 --> 20:25.542
because I didn't invite her
to come down here.

20:25.590 --> 20:27.319
I was about to

20:27.360 --> 20:31.319
when she called
and she... asked to come in

20:31.360 --> 20:33.555
with her attorney.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.551
I know I wasn't...

20:36.600 --> 20:39.421
completely forthcoming before.

20:39.470 --> 20:41.893
I talked to my lavwer,
and she's impressed upon me

20:41.940 --> 20:43.828
that I need to tell you
what I know.

20:43.870 --> 20:45.462
Well, by all means.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.478
We are avid fans
of civic duty here.

20:47.510 --> 20:49.432
BELL: But if you're
here to tell us

20:49.480 --> 20:52.404
you were sleeping with Galen
Barrow, we already had a hunch.

20:52.450 --> 20:53.644
How...

20:53.680 --> 20:54.908
GREGSON: _
He was seen entering

20:54.950 --> 20:57.441
your apartment on First Avenue.

20:57.490 --> 21:00.288
That isn't your
primary residence, is it?

21:00.320 --> 21:02.288
It belonged to my mother.

21:02.320 --> 21:03.981
When she passed,
my husband and I kept it

21:04.030 --> 21:05.884
so we could have a place
in the city.

21:05.930 --> 21:08.455
Was your husband aware that you
were putting your pied--terre

21:08.500 --> 21:09.990
to such classic use?

21:10.030 --> 21:11.895
LYDIA:
No, he never knew a thing.

21:11.930 --> 21:14.364
You sure
about that?

21:14.400 --> 21:15.731
Positive.

21:15.770 --> 21:17.431
You said earlier

21:17.470 --> 21:20.473
that the man
who killed Galen was coerced.

21:20.510 --> 21:22.728
Coerced as in blackmailed?

21:22.780 --> 21:24.839
Because I was blackmailed, too.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.314
Funny, you didn't mention that
this morning.

21:27.350 --> 21:28.749
I was trying
to protect my marriage.

21:28.780 --> 21:30.486
I was afraid.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.738
And I didn't do the right thing
at first. I'm sorry.

21:32.790 --> 21:36.510
Why don't you tell us
about the blackmail.

21:36.560 --> 21:40.599
(sighs) About six months ago,
someone started sending

21:40.630 --> 21:42.757
pictures of me and Galen
outside the apartment.

21:42.800 --> 21:46.327
Then text messages came
demanding money,

21:46.370 --> 21:48.497
instructions where to leave it.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.337
Look and you'll see.

21:50.370 --> 21:52.429
Did you comply with the demands?
Whoever it was,

21:52.470 --> 21:54.700
I just wanted to pay them off
and be done with it.

21:54.740 --> 21:58.779
The wording is pretty similar
to the ones we saw yesterday.

21:58.810 --> 22:01.347
Was Galen aware
of the blackmail?

22:01.380 --> 22:05.680
He hated
that I was giving them money.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.483
I begged him
to just drop it.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.056
But he investigated it anyway.

22:09.090 --> 22:11.456
LYDIA: Ithought
I'd gotten through to him.

22:11.490 --> 22:14.357
We had to break things off,
he had to move on, but...

22:14.400 --> 22:16.129
Then when you said that the man

22:16.160 --> 22:18.469
who killed him was being
blackmailed, too?

22:18.500 --> 22:20.491
I don't think Galen
let it go after all.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.462
GREGSON:
Mrs. Guerrero,

22:22.500 --> 22:24.400
have you ever heard
the name Gordon Meadows?

22:26.070 --> 22:28.129
Your husband's firm
do any criminal work?

22:28.180 --> 22:30.398
Maybe Mr. Meadows
is a client.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.907
I don't think so, no.

22:32.950 --> 22:34.770
Excuse me.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.418
I'm sorry. Give us a moment.

22:39.450 --> 22:41.452
Joan?

22:46.790 --> 22:48.428
What are you doing?

22:48.460 --> 22:49.620
Gordon Meadows's phone.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.525
CCS already
checked it out.

22:51.570 --> 22:53.765
There was nothing on it that
would help ID. the blackmailer.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.165
Not directly, no.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.088
But we seek a connection
between Mr. Meadows

22:57.140 --> 22:58.505
and Ms. Guerrero,
do we not?

22:58.540 --> 23:00.428
An explanation
as to how someone was aware

23:00.480 --> 23:02.471
of the transgressions
of a sex offender

23:02.510 --> 23:05.502
and the dalliance of a cougar
and her cub reporter.

23:05.550 --> 23:06.972
And I believe
I found one.

23:07.010 --> 23:10.514
One that might also explain
Galen Barrow's decision

23:10.550 --> 23:13.815
to become a part-time driver.

23:13.860 --> 23:16.954
Both the blackmail
victims used Zooss.

23:21.830 --> 23:23.195
This is ridiculous.

23:23.230 --> 23:24.993
We don't have
the kind of information

23:25.030 --> 23:28.136
that you're
looking for.
No?

23:28.170 --> 23:32.129
Does not each of your users
sign away his or her privacy

23:32.170 --> 23:33.671
the moment they
install your app?

23:33.710 --> 23:36.076
Have we not, every one
one of us, volunteered

23:36.110 --> 23:38.203
to carry around the most
sophisticated surveillance

23:38.250 --> 23:39.877
and tracking device
known to man?

23:39.910 --> 23:44.415
Brandon, would you please
fire up Olympus?

23:46.020 --> 23:50.719
This is a bird's-eye view of
every car online in real time.

23:50.760 --> 23:51.920
You call it "Olympus"?

23:53.900 --> 23:57.222
View from the clouds, the logo--
Greek mythology.

23:57.260 --> 23:58.659
Oh, we get it.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.565
I'm showing it to you
to make a point.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.761
This is literally
all the information

24:02.800 --> 24:04.961
we have on our users.

24:05.010 --> 24:07.672
Where they are,
where and when we pick them up,

24:07.710 --> 24:09.598
where and when
we drop them off-- that's it.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.779
"That's it."

24:11.810 --> 24:13.744
You're describing
your level of omniscience

24:13.780 --> 24:16.749
that's traditionally ascribed
to God and Father Christmas.

24:16.780 --> 24:18.111
BELL:
Mr. Frazer, we think

24:18.150 --> 24:19.742
someone in your
company has been using

24:19.790 --> 24:22.088
this data to find people
with things to hide.

24:22.120 --> 24:24.657
Cross-referencing
users names, for example,

24:24.690 --> 24:25.952
with criminal records

24:25.990 --> 24:28.026
to see who might be doing things
they shouldn't.

24:28.060 --> 24:30.563
Figuring out who's having
affairs based on where they go,

24:30.600 --> 24:31.965
what time and for how long.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.560
WATSON: Two of your
customers were blackmailed.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.636
In both cases, there was
a direct correlation

24:36.670 --> 24:38.809
between their usage of Zooss
and the activities

24:38.840 --> 24:40.808
the blackmailer was able
to use against them.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.001
BRANDON: For argument's
sake, let's say

24:43.040 --> 24:44.769
someone here could do
what you're saying.

24:44.810 --> 24:45.879
No one would.

24:45.910 --> 24:47.810
He'd be an idiot.

24:47.850 --> 24:50.546
Once you last a year here,
you vest, you get stock options.

24:50.590 --> 24:51.943
85% of our employees

24:51.990 --> 24:53.582
are paper millionaires.

24:53.620 --> 24:55.679
Nickel-and-dime extortion
makes no sense.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.518
"We are Big Brother incarnate,

24:58.560 --> 25:00.699
but trust us because our motives
are purely finanCIal."

25:00.730 --> 25:02.129
WATSON:
Whether you believe

25:02.160 --> 25:04.799
someone did it or not,
we have that subpoena.

25:04.830 --> 25:07.196
We'd like your employee records
and data.

25:07.230 --> 25:11.064
All due respect, this has got
a pretty broad reach.

25:11.110 --> 25:13.578
I'd like our lawyers
to take a look at it first.

25:13.610 --> 25:15.100
HOLMES:
Indeed.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.973
They might contest the invasion
of privacy as being too ironic.

25:18.010 --> 25:20.774
BELL: You want to drag your
feet on this, feel free.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.048
Just keep in mind,

25:22.080 --> 25:23.616
this investigation
could be handled quietly,

25:23.650 --> 25:25.641
or it could show up
on the evening news.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.214
I don't know what
that would do

25:27.250 --> 25:30.822
to your stock options,
but it's your call.

25:32.190 --> 25:34.124
Brandon, could you please
get these folks

25:34.160 --> 25:35.297
everything they need?

25:38.270 --> 25:41.762
It says, if we follow
the same traject...

25:41.800 --> 25:42.960
Agatha?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.331
Sherlock. These two gentlemen...

25:44.370 --> 25:45.837
More potential donors?

25:45.870 --> 25:47.132
If she's asked you

25:47.170 --> 25:48.933
to fetch mettle, gentlemen,
I advise against it.

25:48.980 --> 25:50.231
Her motives are impure.

25:52.850 --> 25:54.841
(whispering):
What the hell are you doing?

25:54.880 --> 25:57.986
You really think
I wouldn't realize?
Realize what?

25:58.020 --> 26:00.341
You've entered_ into another
arrangement With my father.

26:00.390 --> 26:02.654
Only this time, instead of
approving a land deal,

26:02.690 --> 26:04.328
you're expected
to produce an heir.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.089
I know that
his foundation has funded

26:06.130 --> 26:07.825
your research through 2023.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.088
That's quite a commitment.

26:09.130 --> 26:10.893
Only, I think
you could have done better.

26:10.930 --> 26:13.228
It's going to take a lot longer
to raise our love child.

26:13.270 --> 26:15.636
I think you're confusing
correlation with causation.

26:15.670 --> 26:17.865
And I think you're confusing
procreation with masturbation.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.764
Father is thinking of himself
and no one else.

26:19.810 --> 26:21.869
I represent the end
of the Holmes line,

26:21.910 --> 26:23.070
and that just won't do.

26:23.110 --> 26:24.805
You're right.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.772
The idea did originate
with your father,

26:26.810 --> 26:28.744
but_ there's no
qUId pro quo.

26:28.780 --> 26:30.748
The funding has
been guaranteed.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.849
Do you honestly imagine
his lawyers won't be able

26:32.890 --> 26:34.255
to bind up that generous request

26:34.290 --> 26:35.848
behind some
trumped up technicality?

26:35.890 --> 26:38.358
My research is a good
investment, even for him.

26:38.390 --> 26:40.824
You don't know him
the way I do.
I know you.

26:42.930 --> 26:46.627
I have been thinking about a
baby for almost two years now.

26:46.670 --> 26:49.059
I realized at a certain point
that while I did not want

26:49.100 --> 26:50.965
the fuss of a marriage,
I did want to be a mother.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.739
I hadn't planned
beyond that.

26:52.770 --> 26:55.307
I was just glad to
have made the decision.

26:55.340 --> 26:57.069
And then, quite
coincidentally,

26:57.110 --> 26:58.907
I happened to run
into your father.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.770
I'm surprised he didn't offer
to seed you himself.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.242
He got me thinking.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.885
And the more I
thought about it,

27:04.920 --> 27:06.842
you are, without question,

27:06.890 --> 27:08.881
the most remarkable
man I've ever known.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.388
You're brilliant, strong.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.182
You've made a career
out of helping people.

27:13.230 --> 27:15.221
There should be more
of you in the world.

27:17.060 --> 27:19.028
You think I'm
being selfish--

27:19.070 --> 27:21.288
this urge to create
a new human life,

27:21.340 --> 27:22.830
one that's a part of me.

27:22.870 --> 27:25.065
But you're being
selfish, too.

27:25.110 --> 27:28.876
You have these gifts,
Sherlock, this goodness.

27:28.910 --> 27:30.070
So share them.

27:30.110 --> 27:32.340
See what happens.

27:32.380 --> 27:35.713
Might not be as
wretched as you think.

27:41.890 --> 27:43.209
What are you doing?

27:43.260 --> 27:44.921
I know you're territorial
about this setup.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.882
I know you don't
like me to touch it.

27:46.930 --> 27:48.693
A judgment you have
repeatedly validated.

27:48.730 --> 27:50.869
I was just trying to
hook up the Olympus data

27:50.900 --> 27:53.221
from Zooss, but it doesn't look
like we have the right wiring.

27:53.270 --> 27:54.897
(claps hands)
Oh.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.259
Come on.

27:56.300 --> 27:57.858
(sighs)

27:57.910 --> 27:59.901
Thank you.
Ooh.

28:01.910 --> 28:04.140
(sighs)

28:04.180 --> 28:06.102
What about the personnel
files they turned over?

28:06.150 --> 28:07.947
Have the police
found anything?

28:07.980 --> 28:09.777
Well, no one has a record,
if that's what you mean.

28:09.820 --> 28:11.708
That's why I wanted to look
at the Olympus records.

28:11.750 --> 28:13.854
I thought maybe we could trace
Gordon Meadows

28:13.890 --> 28:16.085
and Lydia Guerrero's moves
the last few months.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.850
See which employees
logged on at what times.

28:20.830 --> 28:22.889
So, how did it go with Agatha?

28:22.930 --> 28:25.125
Oh, I was right.
My father is the instigator.

28:25.170 --> 28:27.889
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.464
Do you plan to reproduce?

28:29.500 --> 28:31.138
Excuse me?

28:31.170 --> 28:33.035
Are you going
to procreate at some point?

28:33.070 --> 28:35.277
I don't know. I mean,
I think about it sometimes.

28:35.310 --> 28:37.198
I don't... Why?

28:37.240 --> 28:38.798
(sighs)

28:38.850 --> 28:41.114
(computer chimes)
How did you do...?

28:41.150 --> 28:43.038
Don't be _ashamed.
We can Sign you up

28:43.080 --> 28:44.809
for a remedial course
at a senior center.

28:44.850 --> 28:47.011
(phone chimes)

28:47.050 --> 28:50.156
Marcus. He says
he just got a call from a woman

28:50.190 --> 28:52.886
whose brother was
a programmer at Zooss.

28:52.930 --> 28:56.058
Right up until...
he was murdered last month.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.037
I recognized him
when I saw the news.

29:03.070 --> 29:07.063
He came to see me _
after what happened to Patrick.

29:07.110 --> 29:09.999
And he questioned you?

29:10.040 --> 29:12.099
I didn't know
he was a driver for the company.

29:12.150 --> 29:13.447
He said he was a reporter.

29:13.480 --> 29:15.072
He was both.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.815
We believe he started driving

29:16.850 --> 29:18.112
because he was digging
into Zooss.

29:18.150 --> 29:20.118
What did he want to know?

29:20.150 --> 29:22.983
Mostly about
Patrick's job,

29:23.020 --> 29:26.922
like if I knew about any
problems Patrick had at work.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.951
I didn't.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.797
You_r brother's
case is unsolved.

29:30.830 --> 29:32.969
The detective wrote that it
was a robbery gone wrong.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.991
Did you think it
was more than that?

29:35.040 --> 29:36.860
Not until today.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.266
Somebody attacked him
outside of his apartment,

29:39.310 --> 29:40.937
stole his wallet.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.130
They had a pipe.

29:43.180 --> 29:45.569
We thought
that he was gonna pull through.

29:45.610 --> 29:49.876
Maybe if someone had
found him sooner.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.946
Oh, he was in the hospital
for a few days.

29:52.990 --> 29:55.584
Were you able to talk to him
before he passed?

29:55.620 --> 29:59.158
They had him
in a medically-induced coma.

29:59.190 --> 30:00.953
There were complications.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.127
He never woke up.

30:03.160 --> 30:05.958
We thought it was

30:06.000 --> 30:08.434
like the cop said-- a mugging--

30:08.470 --> 30:11.268
but when I saw
this guy was killed, I just...

30:11.310 --> 30:13.198
I thought I should
say something.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.299
It_ seemed like too
big a c0inCIdence.

30:15.340 --> 30:18.878
Now, uh, it's possible
that Patrick detected

30:18.910 --> 30:21.845
the presence of a blackmailer
inside Zooss.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.017
That's why he was targeted.

30:23.050 --> 30:25.143
It would be very,
very helpful for us

30:25.190 --> 30:27.044
if we could look at his
cell phone and his computer.

30:27.090 --> 30:28.978
Do you still have those?

30:29.020 --> 30:31.853
All his stuff is still
at his place in Cobble Hill.

30:31.890 --> 30:33.858
I've been meaning
to go back there.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.856
It's just,

30:35.900 --> 30:38.289
that's where it happened,
out front.

30:38.330 --> 30:41.936
It's been hard... going back.

30:41.970 --> 30:45.201
Yeah, yeah.
Perhaps we could go for you.

30:47.040 --> 30:49.133
I mean, the longest conversation
that he and I ever had was

30:49.180 --> 30:51.239
probably when he interviewed
to take the room.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.646
Um... when_he
wasn't working,

30:53.680 --> 30:55.409
he was just
watching basketball.

30:55.450 --> 30:57.475
Like, 24/7.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.401
I don't think the murders
of Patrick Kemp and Galen Barrow

31:20.440 --> 31:21.998
are related after all.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.349
That was fast.

31:24.380 --> 31:26.905
Given the nature
of Kemp's wounds,

31:26.950 --> 31:30.010
I'm sure you
concurred, as did I,

31:30.050 --> 31:33.019
with the NYPD's
initial assessment.

31:33.050 --> 31:36.679
_ It was not
an intentional murder.

31:36.720 --> 31:40.178
With a little more luck,
he might have survived.

31:40.230 --> 31:42.994
Now I think we know why.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.389
Sports almanacs?

31:46.430 --> 31:50.059
I'd wager-- pun intended--

31:50.100 --> 31:52.534
that Patrick Kemp was attacked
over gambling debts.

31:52.570 --> 31:55.038
I'm not getting
a very sporty vibe here.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.377
Precisely.

31:56.410 --> 32:00.073
His roommate said he was
obsessed with basketball,

32:00.110 --> 32:03.045
but there's not a whiff
of fandom in here.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.241
He's a collector of
statistical almanacs

32:05.290 --> 32:09.078
and team schedules, spreadsheets
of games won and lost.

32:09.120 --> 32:13.523
But there's not so much as a
T-shirt with a team logo on it.

32:13.560 --> 32:16.495
No, it seems that his interest
was purely financial.

32:16.530 --> 32:19.328
Well, maybe he just preferred
shirts with collars.

32:19.370 --> 32:21.167
If I'm wrong,
where is his guitar?

32:21.200 --> 32:23.065
Where are any of
the creature comforts

32:23.100 --> 32:24.465
that you might expect
an upwardly mobile

32:24.510 --> 32:25.534
young programmer to acquire?

32:25.570 --> 32:28.004
I submit that he's

32:28.040 --> 32:31.976
pawned them all in an ultimately
unsuccessful attempt...

32:32.010 --> 32:34.615
to keep up with the vig...

32:34.650 --> 32:37.175
and perhaps buy an unusual
amount of burner phones.

32:37.220 --> 32:39.541
Actually, that makes sense.

32:39.590 --> 32:41.353
I think you're right.

32:43.660 --> 32:47.027
Patrick Kemp wasn't killed
by the blackmailer at Zooss.

32:47.060 --> 32:50.154
He wa the blackmailer at Zooss.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.690
Kemp died over a month ago.

32:51.730 --> 32:53.664
Galen Barrow died
three nights ago.

32:53.700 --> 32:56.237
If Kemp was
the blackmailer,

32:56.270 --> 32:58.158
who had Barrow killed?

33:05.810 --> 33:07.300
Sherlock?

33:07.350 --> 33:09.318
HOLMES:
Up here!

33:12.450 --> 33:14.452
(footsteps approaching)

33:20.130 --> 33:21.358
(sighs)
What's all this?

33:21.400 --> 33:23.095
The view from Olympus.

33:23.130 --> 33:24.290
Or views, rather.

33:24.330 --> 33:25.524
This is from last Monday,

33:25.570 --> 33:27.197
Tuesday, Wednesday,

33:27.230 --> 33:28.436
so on and so forth.

33:28.470 --> 33:30.233
But we only asked
for this data

33:30.270 --> 33:32.158
so we could help identify
the blackmailer.

33:32.210 --> 33:34.303
We already know
it's Patrick Kemp.

33:34.340 --> 33:35.807
The same Patrick Kemp

33:35.840 --> 33:39.606
who died four weeks before
Galen Barrow was murdered.

33:39.650 --> 33:42.210
We know that Barrow
sought to undo

33:42.250 --> 33:45.310
a blackmailer at Zooss,
but it occurred to me,

33:45.350 --> 33:48.478
what if he'd stumbled across
some other secret along the way?

33:48.520 --> 33:51.080
I thought that tracing
his movements might point us

33:51.130 --> 33:53.621
in the direction of
the orchestrator of his murder.

33:53.660 --> 33:55.799
You think he was getting
too close to someone else?

33:55.830 --> 33:57.798
Someone who knew
about Kemp's activities.

33:57.830 --> 33:59.593
Someone who also had
something to lose.

33:59.630 --> 34:00.790
The cars are moving

34:00.830 --> 34:02.798
so fast--
did you accelerate the feed?

34:02.840 --> 34:04.569
What better way
to trace the movements

34:04.610 --> 34:07.829
of several thousand Zooss users
over several months?

34:07.870 --> 34:10.703
Wait. You watched everything
they gave us in one night?

34:10.740 --> 34:13.243
As you can see,
I'm almost entirely caught up.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.578
What happened to just studying
Galen's movements?

34:15.620 --> 34:19.181
I defy you to look at the city
from this vantage point

34:19.220 --> 34:20.744
and not discern
certain patterns.

34:20.790 --> 34:22.451
What do you mean?

34:24.460 --> 34:27.179
Bryce Newsome--
he is a scoundrel.

34:27.230 --> 34:28.822
Quite prone
to one-night stands.

34:28.860 --> 34:31.226
There is hope, however,
'cause he's taken to seeing

34:31.270 --> 34:33.329
a therapist
every Tuesday night at 7:00.

34:33.370 --> 34:35.099
Leon Kennard, ad executive.

34:35.140 --> 34:36.869
He requires a change of scenery.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.606
Why else would he be
paying visits

34:38.640 --> 34:41.279
to his company's competitors
during his off hours?

34:41.310 --> 34:42.732
April Lindgren.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.577
Her comings and goings
are the very definition

34:44.610 --> 34:47.670
of predictable, or at least they
were until several weeks ago.

34:47.710 --> 34:50.349
Her son has been diagnosed with
some form of cancer-- leukemia,

34:50.380 --> 34:51.608
judging by the experts
she's conferred.

34:51.650 --> 34:52.878
She's been spending

34:52.920 --> 34:54.751
the bulk of her time
at the hospital.

34:54.790 --> 34:57.884
Although she did pay a recent
visit to a funeral home...

34:57.920 --> 35:00.354
presumably to make arrangements.

35:00.390 --> 35:03.518
Why did you just put yourself
through all this?

35:03.560 --> 35:07.360
(sighs) Actually,
I didn't intend to, but...

35:07.400 --> 35:09.197
once I started...

35:09.240 --> 35:10.832
Okay, say you're right.

35:10.870 --> 35:13.703
The person who killed Galen
Barrow had something to lose.

35:13.740 --> 35:16.629
Maybe someone at Zooss figured
out he was poking around

35:16.680 --> 35:19.103
and had Galen killed
to protect the company.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.540
Like I was saying...
If you think that
someone from Zooss

35:27.590 --> 35:30.150
is behind Galen Barrow's murder,
you're right.

35:30.190 --> 35:33.353
But you're wrong-- it's not to
do with protecting the company.

35:33.390 --> 35:35.255
What are you talking about?

35:35.300 --> 35:39.361
Olympus. It gave me the answers
that we seek several hours ago.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.231
I know who the killer is.

35:41.270 --> 35:43.261
We're going to see him
this morning.

35:52.210 --> 35:53.802
My assistant
just told me

35:53.850 --> 35:55.738
you were here; she said
you have more questions.

35:55.780 --> 35:57.475
Mr. Falchek, have a seat.

35:57.520 --> 35:59.249
Should I get Eric
and the others?

35:59.290 --> 36:01.417
No, no. We'll be
speaking with them presently.

36:01.460 --> 36:04.349
Does the name Felice Armistead
mean anything to you?

36:04.390 --> 36:06.483
No. Why would it?

36:06.530 --> 36:08.418
She's a Zooss user.

36:08.460 --> 36:10.655
Has been since
September 2013.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.194
I'm confused.

36:13.230 --> 36:14.834
Is this the person
you think killed Galen?

36:14.870 --> 36:18.465
No. It's the person
we think he was killed over.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.262
HOLMES:
As a customer,

36:20.310 --> 36:23.370
I'd classify her usage
as mundane.

36:23.410 --> 36:26.504
Her pickups and drop-offs
were almost exclusively...

36:26.550 --> 36:27.505
Hey!

36:27.550 --> 36:29.211
...from her home or her office.

36:30.620 --> 36:32.542
She utilized your cars
to frequent

36:32.590 --> 36:34.854
a number of, you know,
bars and restaurants,

36:34.890 --> 36:38.348
as well as a fairly
tight circle of...

36:38.390 --> 36:40.858
friends and family.

36:40.890 --> 36:42.448
Then one day,

36:42.500 --> 36:45.765
a deviation.

36:45.800 --> 36:49.463
She used one of your vehicles
to visit a police station.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.559
Would it interest
you to know

36:51.610 --> 36:53.407
that of all the Zooss
users in Manhattan,

36:53.440 --> 36:55.499
only 36 people have
used your cars to go

36:55.540 --> 36:57.929
to or from a police station
in the last six months?

36:57.980 --> 36:59.948
The average citizen
pays a visit

36:59.980 --> 37:02.778
to a precinct
once in a lifetime. Hmm?

37:02.820 --> 37:04.583
They are places
to be avoided.

37:04.620 --> 37:07.714
So these individuals stood out
like 36 sore thumbs.

37:07.750 --> 37:09.718
As it turns out,
19 of them

37:09.760 --> 37:11.728
work in and around
the department.

37:11.760 --> 37:14.558
Cops, attorneys,
administrators.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.022
Ten were witnesses
who were asked

37:16.060 --> 37:17.948
to give a statement,
and the remaining seven

37:18.000 --> 37:19.695
went there
to report a crime.

37:19.730 --> 37:21.561
Ms. Armistead was
one of those seven.

37:21.600 --> 37:22.931
GREGSON:
She told a detective

37:22.970 --> 37:24.938
about some disturbing e-mails

37:24.970 --> 37:26.801
she'd been receiving--
some creep

37:26.840 --> 37:29.968
with an anonymous server
kept sending her messages.

37:30.010 --> 37:31.705
"I'm watching you."

37:31.750 --> 37:33.604
"I know what you're wearing."

37:33.650 --> 37:35.447
"I know who you're with."
Many of the e-mails

37:35.480 --> 37:36.879
wer_e_a lot more
eprICIt than that,

37:36.920 --> 37:38.478
but that's neither
here nor there.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.942
The point is, she
was being stalked--

37:39.990 --> 37:42.311
stalked by someone who
always seemed to know

37:42.360 --> 37:43.952
exactly where she was.

37:43.990 --> 37:47.448
And you're telling me
this because...?

37:47.490 --> 37:50.357
One night, her stalker got brave
enough to break into her house.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.561
He was picking through her
drawers when she surprised him.

37:52.600 --> 37:53.999
There was a struggle.

37:54.030 --> 37:55.759
He broke her cheekbone
before he got away.

37:55.800 --> 37:56.960
HOLMES:
The next day,

37:57.000 --> 37:59.662
she took a Zooss car
to go and stay

37:59.710 --> 38:01.507
with her parents
in Westchester.

38:01.540 --> 38:02.837
Obviously,
she failed to understand

38:02.880 --> 38:04.905
that her stalker
had been using Olympus

38:04.950 --> 38:06.542
to watch her all along.

38:06.580 --> 38:08.969
WATSON: Now, we found
records that indicate

38:09.020 --> 38:11.887
you cut off Patrick Kemp's
access to Olympus

38:11.920 --> 38:13.444
seven weeks ago.

38:13.490 --> 38:14.889
Probably because
you realized

38:14.920 --> 38:17.753
he was blackmailing people--
you kept it quiet.

38:17.790 --> 38:20.588
If you hadn't, you could've
brought the whole company down.

38:20.630 --> 38:22.450
HOLMES: Not that we think
you did what you did

38:22.500 --> 38:24.559
to protect your shares
at the company. No.

38:24.600 --> 38:27.023
You did it to protect
your favorite peephole

38:27.070 --> 38:29.459
into the life
of your favorite prey.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.559
I wondered when and where
you first laid eyes

38:31.610 --> 38:33.464
on Miss Armistead,

38:33.510 --> 38:35.603
so I attempted to
track your movements

38:35.640 --> 38:38.677
using Olympus over the
last several months.

38:38.710 --> 38:42.043
Turns out, you don't partake
of your own company's service.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.672
Wonder why.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.846
I want a lawyer.
GREGSON:
That's fine.

38:46.890 --> 38:48.915
He can join us for the lineup

38:48.960 --> 38:51.554
you're gonna be in
at the station.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.683
Miss Armistead didn't get a very
good look at you that night,

38:53.730 --> 38:56.449
but her description was enough
to make me think of you.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.388
I predict she'll have

38:58.430 --> 39:00.694
little trouble
picking you out.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.676
I assume, since you
asked to meet me here

39:16.720 --> 39:18.608
rather than _
a room downstairs,

39:18.650 --> 39:21.653
you've decided not
to impregnate me.

39:21.690 --> 39:23.988
At least, the old-fashioned way.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.367
(sighs)

39:36.940 --> 39:39.431
It's okay, Sherlock.

39:39.470 --> 39:41.131
The things I
said yesterday--

39:41.170 --> 39:42.808
I put too much
pressure on you.

39:42.840 --> 39:45.900
You made some good points.

39:45.950 --> 39:48.373
Not enough to
sway you though.

39:49.450 --> 39:51.441
You were right.

39:51.490 --> 39:54.755
I am... remarkable.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.881
That's precisely why
I can't help you.

39:59.930 --> 40:01.750
What does you being amazing
have to do...

40:01.800 --> 40:03.688
No, no, no.
I didn't say I was "amazing."

40:03.730 --> 40:05.095
I said I was "remarkable."

40:09.100 --> 40:10.931
The things that I do,

40:10.970 --> 40:14.701
the things that
you care about, um...

40:14.740 --> 40:17.607
you think that I do them
'cause I'm a good person.

40:19.610 --> 40:22.477
I do them 'cause it would
hurt too much not to.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.886
Because you're a good person.

40:25.920 --> 40:29.185
No, it hurts, Agatha.

40:29.220 --> 40:30.812
All this.

40:32.730 --> 40:34.891
Everything I see,

40:34.930 --> 40:38.798
everything I hear,
touch, smell.

40:38.830 --> 40:41.958
The conclusions
that I'm able to draw.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.798
The things that are
revealed to me.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.831
The ugliness.

40:49.710 --> 40:53.202
My work focuses me.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.115
It helps.

40:57.120 --> 41:00.749
You say that I'm using my gifts.

41:00.790 --> 41:02.815
I say I'm just treating them.

41:05.860 --> 41:10.490
So I cannot, in good conscience,

41:10.530 --> 41:12.760
pass all of that
on to someone else.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.760
Sorry.

41:19.770 --> 41:21.772
*

41:29.080 --> 41:31.878
(lock clicking)

41:31.920 --> 41:33.182
(door opens)

41:33.220 --> 41:35.688
(sighs)

41:35.720 --> 41:38.553
So did Agatha really decide
to go home one day early,

41:38.590 --> 41:40.251
or did you just not want
to pay for another night

41:40.290 --> 41:41.791
at Lutece?

41:41.830 --> 41:43.092
The bearskin rug is gone.

41:43.130 --> 41:45.724
It is now safe
to move about the brownstone.

41:45.770 --> 41:48.989
Well, I'm sorry things
didn't work out between you two.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.689
No, you can't be sorry because
there was nothing to work out.

41:50.740 --> 41:51.832
And there was nothing
to work out

41:51.870 --> 41:53.098
because there's nothing
between us.

41:55.580 --> 41:56.729
I was just taking advantage
of her absence

41:56.780 --> 41:58.031
to dig through some cold cases.

41:58.080 --> 42:01.004
Well... you want company?

42:01.050 --> 42:03.871
No, thank you.

42:05.990 --> 42:07.582
How about some ice cream?

42:09.820 --> 42:11.685
You know, it's the stuff
that people eat

42:11.730 --> 42:12.958
when they're feeling
a little down.

42:14.290 --> 42:17.555
I have everything
I need right here.

42:19.900 --> 42:21.959
Okay.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.298
What-what kind of ice cream?

42:26.370 --> 42:28.577
I'll bring you
a couple of choices.

42:34.680 --> 42:35.669
