<i>[J.D.] Since my scooter was in the shop,</i>
<i>I didn't know how I'd get to work,</i>

00:06.506 --> 00:09.270
<i>but luckily, my neighbor,</i>
<i>Ronald, lent me his ride.</i>

00:10.243 --> 00:11.801
<i>Ronald's six.</i>

00:11.911 --> 00:15.574
<i>But I still got there in time to steal</i>
<i>the guard's Arts & Leisure section.</i>

00:15.648 --> 00:17.582
Hello!

00:17.917 --> 00:22.081
<i>Around here, everyone has</i>
<i>some sort of morning ritual.</i>

00:22.155 --> 00:26.592
<i>Getting help on the word jumble from</i>
<i>your dyslexic tracheotomy patient...</i>

00:26.659 --> 00:28.388
T-P-l-P-O-E.

00:28.461 --> 00:30.986
[Gasps] Pot pie.

00:31.064 --> 00:34.158
Save your voice, Marsha. Mmm. Save it.

00:37.637 --> 00:39.502
[Squeaks]

00:39.572 --> 00:43.531
<i>[J.D.] Cursing out an innocent orderly</i>
<i>over a stolen physical therapy tub...</i>

00:43.643 --> 00:47.272
Damn it, you better find it!
Physical therapy tubs don't disappear!

00:47.347 --> 00:49.815
[Squeaking]

00:49.883 --> 00:53.751
<i>Or, for some, just a relaxing</i>
<i>afternoon soak on the roof.</i>

00:55.922 --> 00:59.688
Oh, come on. Let me in.
This totally covers my boys.

01:03.029 --> 01:08.296
Try and get in here in that thing, I'll
give you a four-story atomic wedgie.

01:08.368 --> 01:09.733
<i>[Watch beeps]</i>

01:15.775 --> 01:17.140
[Screams] My eyes!

01:19.612 --> 01:21.773
- [Crashing]
- [J.D. Screams]

01:24.150 --> 01:25.640
[J.D.] Yeah, it hurt.

01:25.718 --> 01:28.380
But when you accept
the keys to the hog,

01:28.455 --> 01:32.152
you become a lifetime member
of the danger club.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.659
Excuse me, fine ladies,

01:36.496 --> 01:38.396
but I've got lives to save.

01:40.366 --> 01:43.267
- Oh! Ronald's gonna be mad.
- He's six.

01:43.336 --> 01:46.499
- What's he gonna do? Kick my ass?
<i>- Again?</i>

01:47.073 --> 01:50.236
Check this chart. Guy says
he's been in pain for three months.

01:50.343 --> 01:52.311
<i>For doctors, pain is complicated.</i>

01:52.412 --> 01:55.904
<i>Every patient handles it differently,</i>
<i>depending on their race...</i>

01:55.982 --> 01:57.279
Does what hurt?

01:57.350 --> 01:58.510
<i>... gender...</i>

01:58.618 --> 02:01.178
Ow! I just bit the inside of my lip.

02:01.254 --> 02:04.781
Nothing has ever hurt so badly!

02:04.858 --> 02:06.621
<i>... or even their sex life.</i>

02:06.693 --> 02:09.594
Oh, yeah! That feels good!

02:09.662 --> 02:12.893
<i>Since there's no way to truly gauge</i>
<i>how much pain someone's in,</i>

02:12.966 --> 02:14.991
<i>we have to rely on an archaic chart.</i>

02:15.068 --> 02:18.629
Mr. Peele, you're about a seven
on the pain chart.

02:24.444 --> 02:25.877
Yep, you're a seven.

02:25.945 --> 02:27.469
What's a 10?

02:27.547 --> 02:30.914
[Screaming]

02:33.253 --> 02:34.550
That's a 10.

02:37.624 --> 02:41.082
# <i>I can't do this</i>
<i>all on my own</i>

02:41.161 --> 02:44.528
# <i>No, I know</i>
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

02:47.667 --> 02:49.635
# <i>I'm no Superman</i> #

02:53.573 --> 02:54.835
<i>[J.D.] After four years,</i>

02:54.908 --> 02:58.537
<i>I'm comfortable helping myself</i>
<i>to the nurses' muffin basket.</i>

03:03.783 --> 03:07.344
<i>Blueberry-cran-carrot-zucchini</i>
<i>poppy-seed-chocolate-chip.</i>

03:07.420 --> 03:08.978
All right, everybody.

03:09.055 --> 03:12.582
Last one here has to do
a double shift this weekend!

03:16.696 --> 03:18.561
Keith, you just lost your weekend.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.599
What? I totally beat Lisa!

03:20.700 --> 03:22.600
Call that androgynous husband

03:22.669 --> 03:25.001
and tell him or her
you're mine this weekend.

03:25.071 --> 03:27.039
But I feel like I edged out James.

03:27.106 --> 03:29.404
We're not clear on the ground rules.

03:29.475 --> 03:32.205
The last one to touch my face.
I'm not gonna like that.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.838
The last one to touch my bot...
No, that's illegal.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.473
I'll just e-mail everyone.
That's what I'll do.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.916
In this day, that's what you do.
OK, over here.

03:40.019 --> 03:43.648
Guys, Mr. Jenkins spent all night
without being treated.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.953
Now, I know he's homeless

03:46.025 --> 03:48.186
and smells like
an obese man's two-sie.

03:48.261 --> 03:50.752
- Hey!
- Sorry, thought you were dozing.

03:50.830 --> 03:56.291
The thing is, it doesn't matter if he's
homeless or some senile racist...

03:56.369 --> 03:59.634
- Which people do I hate again?
- Immigrants, Mr. Bursick.

03:59.706 --> 04:01.173
You hate all immigrants.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.301
- And why do I hate...?
- I don't have time, Mr. Bursick.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.408
Guys, if I give you a patient,

04:07.480 --> 04:09.744
I expect you to work
your butts off for him.

04:09.816 --> 04:13.479
And P.S.,
Mr. Jenkins is a Vietnam vet.

04:13.553 --> 04:18.047
So let's take care of him
like he took care of our nation.

04:18.124 --> 04:19.853
Get out of here!

04:20.927 --> 04:24.693
That's how you light a fire
under their butts. Some inspiration!

04:24.764 --> 04:28.996
Too much talking, too much talking,
too much talking, too much talking.

04:29.068 --> 04:34.028
Why did you order a BMP test
on my patient, Mrs. Wilk, last night?

04:34.107 --> 04:36.769
- Because she's my patient.
- Interesting,

04:36.843 --> 04:40.802
- seeing as I admitted her.
- And I treated her last night.

04:40.880 --> 04:46.147
- Dr. Dorian, why do I hate all...?
- They're stealing all of our jobs.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.710
Stealing all of our jobs.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.552
Perry, we spent an equal
amount of time with Mrs. Wilk.

04:51.658 --> 04:54.218
Seeing as we're both attendings,
i.e. "equals,"

04:54.327 --> 04:57.296
why don't we let her decide
who her doctor is, huh?

04:57.397 --> 05:02.460
Or we could skip the day trip
to Unnecessary-land,

05:02.535 --> 05:07.268
and instead, simply concede
that Mrs. Wilk is my patient

05:07.340 --> 05:10.707
and that, while we are both attendings,
we are in no way equals.

05:10.810 --> 05:16.476
We are, in fact, not equals.
We are... hmm, unequals.

05:17.850 --> 05:21.081
- I choose Dr. Dorian.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

05:21.154 --> 05:25.113
I don't even believe it!
I don't believe it-lieve it-lieve it!

05:25.191 --> 05:27.056
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

05:27.126 --> 05:29.822
Yes! I'm shaking!
Look at this! It's crazy-talk!

05:29.896 --> 05:32.421
He played hearts with me all night.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.125
[Moans]

05:34.200 --> 05:36.327
You're a very strange man,
aren't you?

05:36.402 --> 05:38.131
I was a preemie.

05:39.939 --> 05:41.099
[Whimpering]

05:42.041 --> 05:43.770
Mr. Peele, I have run every test,

05:43.843 --> 05:46.505
and I cannot find any medical reason
for your pain.

05:46.579 --> 05:47.876
[Groans loudly]

05:47.947 --> 05:52.043
<i>[J.D.] Then Elliot did what every good</i>
<i>doctor does when they're truly stumped.</i>

05:52.118 --> 05:54.882
<i>- She pawned him off.</i>
- I've called a surgical consult.

05:54.954 --> 05:58.651
- [Groans]
- Help has arrived! Help has arrived.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.215
Turkelton.

06:00.293 --> 06:04.252
<i>And then Turk said what every surgeon</i>
<i>says when he's not sure what to do.</i>

06:04.864 --> 06:06.695
Hmm. Mind if I slice you open?

06:06.766 --> 06:09.257
[Both scream]

06:09.335 --> 06:10.768
Uncool!

06:12.572 --> 06:14.506
OK, listen up, everyone!

06:14.574 --> 06:19.910
I'm sure you all got the flier I made
reminding everyone of the staff picture.

06:19.979 --> 06:21.640
I need to know by a show of hands

06:21.714 --> 06:24.239
how many of you aren't
gonna be able to make it.

06:24.784 --> 06:27.617
Oh, come on!

06:27.687 --> 06:31.020
Aren't you guys embarrassed
by our last three staff pictures?

06:38.030 --> 06:43.468
Laverne, I'm gonna need a little of your
church enthusiasm to help sell this.

06:45.638 --> 06:48.163
Damn it, everyone!
We are a family!

06:48.241 --> 06:50.072
A family, people!

06:50.143 --> 06:54.079
- And I know we love each other.
- Love's all we've got!

06:54.147 --> 06:58.914
So can't we just take 10 minutes
from our day to take a real staff photo?

06:59.018 --> 07:01.043
# <i>Yes, we can!</i>

07:01.721 --> 07:04.281
# <i>Yes, we can!</i> #

07:04.390 --> 07:07.848
- Tambourine's a little much.
- Carla, I don't photograph well.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.828
On my driver's license,
I look like Gary Busey.

07:11.831 --> 07:14.732
They say the same thing about me.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.632
See ya later, Elliot.

07:18.704 --> 07:22.333
I am gonna let Big Bob here
give the first excuse.

07:22.408 --> 07:26.344
- Blah, blah, blah. I'm not doing it.
- I'm caught on his collar!

07:26.412 --> 07:29.176
This picture is happening!

07:29.816 --> 07:30.874
No, it's not.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.850
Oh, what do you know, mop jock?

07:32.919 --> 07:34.944
I've predicted a couple things:

07:35.021 --> 07:38.286
The kitchen fire of '97,
the kitchen fire of '98,

07:38.357 --> 07:40.416
the arson conviction
of Luis the cook,

07:40.493 --> 07:44.520
and the termination of the hospital's
"Convicts-to-Cooks" program.

07:44.597 --> 07:47.327
The bottom line, not gonna happen.

07:47.934 --> 07:52.701
# <i>Not gonna happen!</i>
<i>No, not gonna happen!</i>

07:52.772 --> 07:54.899
# <i>Not gonna happ...</i>

07:55.541 --> 07:59.375
By the way, I, uh...
I won't be at the picture either.

08:00.046 --> 08:03.812
You'll be there.
You'll all be there.

08:04.951 --> 08:06.009
Hello!

08:06.085 --> 08:10.044
If you're wondering what a "Thank you
for being my doctor" card looks like,

08:10.156 --> 08:12.681
it looks a little something like this.

08:12.758 --> 08:15.226
"Happy anniversary, gals"?

08:15.294 --> 08:18.457
Oops. This one's for my Aunt Judy
and her lady friend.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.897
- Must've grabbed the wrong card.
- Newbie...

08:21.000 --> 08:24.697
Oh, right, your imaginary warning light.
Don't be mad, Perry.

08:24.770 --> 08:27.136
This day was bound to come.
I've studied you.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.868
I've taken your best qualities
and my best,

08:29.942 --> 08:32.775
and I've combined them
into something even better.

08:32.845 --> 08:35.905
Much the way that iced tea
and lemonade were joined

08:35.982 --> 08:37.677
to become an Arnold Palmer.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.913
Incidentally, has anyone ever
done less to become famous?

08:40.986 --> 08:43.751
I mean, "Yay for me!
I mixed two drinks together."

08:43.856 --> 08:46.120
Arnold Palmer is a golfer.

08:46.192 --> 08:50.822
I'm sure he has lots of hobbies, Perry.
The man's a drink mogul. "Dear..."

08:50.897 --> 08:53.195
<i>[J.D.] In a hospital,</i>
<i>even the best of moods</i>

08:53.266 --> 08:56.360
<i>can be ruined simply</i>
<i>by somebody handing you a chart.</i>

08:59.572 --> 09:01.437
Do you have any family, Mrs. Wilk?

09:01.507 --> 09:06.604
No. I was married twice.
Divorced one, the other died.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.237
Wrong one died.

09:09.282 --> 09:14.242
Look, Mrs. Wilk, you have something
called systemic amyloidosis.

09:14.353 --> 09:18.915
Now, it's in your liver now, but it'll
eventually shut down all your organs.

09:18.991 --> 09:23.928
There is a treatment,
but it's very invasive and, at best,

09:23.996 --> 09:26.965
it'll just give you a little more time.

09:30.169 --> 09:33.536
- Well, I've had a great life, so...
- Say no more.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.905
I'm gonna take amazing care of you.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.040
OK.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.643
- How's it going today?
- Crappy.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.239
I had to tell an old lady
she's dying. You?

09:45.318 --> 09:48.185
OK. Elliot turfed this
chronic pain patient to me.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.712
I have no idea what's wrong,
so I have to do exploratory surgery.

09:51.791 --> 09:54.885
<i>[J.D.] I always wondered what</i>
<i>exploratory surgery was like.</i>

09:55.528 --> 09:57.689
I've made the first incision.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.492
I'm going in.

10:00.866 --> 10:03.027
- [Grunting]
- [Squishy sounds]

10:06.372 --> 10:08.272
Nurse, hat!

10:10.242 --> 10:13.700
Colon. Why'd it have to be the colon?

10:17.984 --> 10:20.714
Removing the golden tumor.

10:22.888 --> 10:25.413
[Shouting]

10:31.197 --> 10:32.858
Ladies...

10:36.235 --> 10:37.896
They knew the risks.

10:38.904 --> 10:41.134
Watch out for colon darts.

10:41.207 --> 10:42.572
Where's the donut truck?

10:42.642 --> 10:45.008
I got paged there was
a donut truck out here.

10:45.077 --> 10:47.307
I got paged there was a handbag sale.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.610
Where's the booby-touching booth?

10:49.682 --> 10:53.413
Weird. Like everyone was lured
by the thing they want most.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.250
Hey, you're not getting your ass kicked.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.290
Hold the phone! Look!

10:58.758 --> 11:00.316
Bleachers!

11:00.426 --> 11:02.053
Ladder!

11:02.128 --> 11:04.426
Bucket of combs!

11:04.497 --> 11:07.261
She's trying to take the picture.
Scatter!

11:10.269 --> 11:13.602
Nobody move! Laverne, door!

11:13.673 --> 11:15.698
Nobody's getting past here, baby!

11:18.678 --> 11:21.238
OK, everybody.
One, two...

11:21.347 --> 11:23.076
And three.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.482
What are you doing here?

11:27.553 --> 11:29.714
Mrs. Wilk was asking me questions

11:29.822 --> 11:33.553
that I actually thought would be
best answered by you.

11:33.626 --> 11:36.993
Why did that sweaty attorney
ask me if my affairs were in order?

11:37.063 --> 11:41.090
Because I wanted to make sure
that you're as comfortable as possible.

11:41.167 --> 11:44.933
- As comfortable as possible? For what?
- I'm going to sit for this.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.636
For the place that you're going.

11:48.708 --> 11:54.078
The big puffy clouds, bright lights,
all your old friends...

11:54.180 --> 11:57.081
- Seattle?
- No, no, no. Not Seattle.

11:57.149 --> 12:01.108
The... You know,
the "dying peacefully" place.

12:01.187 --> 12:05.453
- What are you talking about?
- Now, I'm going to stand.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.054
This morning, you told me
you'd had a great life.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.756
Exactly. And I'd like to continue it.

12:13.199 --> 12:17.260
This is just a misunderstanding.
Sorry. Tell her it's a misunderstanding.

12:17.336 --> 12:19.201
He's tried to kill before.

12:19.271 --> 12:23.435
<i>In a hospital, the words "I'm sorry"</i>
<i>can mean a lot of different things.</i>

12:25.211 --> 12:27.145
So, the surgery went fine.

12:27.213 --> 12:30.546
Unfortunately, I didn't find
any medical reason for your pain.

12:30.616 --> 12:33.744
<i>It can mean, "I'm giving up on you."</i>

12:34.186 --> 12:35.619
I'm sorry.

12:36.722 --> 12:39.190
<i>It can mean you're not sorry at all.</i>

12:40.359 --> 12:42.793
Sorry your picture didn't come out.

12:42.862 --> 12:44.227
Yeah.

12:46.432 --> 12:50.596
<i>And, sometimes, "I'm sorry" can mean</i>
<i>your services are no longer needed.</i>

12:51.070 --> 12:52.833
I'm sorry, Dr. Dorian.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.634
So you gave her the old
death sentence, did ya?

12:55.708 --> 12:59.610
In the business, we call that a rookie
mistake, but thanks for playing.

13:06.819 --> 13:09.287
Who the hell's responsible for this?

13:09.355 --> 13:13.291
<i>Not even my giant mouthful of</i>
<i>apple-pear-orange-banana-cherry-berry</i>

13:13.359 --> 13:15.987
<i>could lift my depression</i>
<i>about losing my patient.</i>

13:16.061 --> 13:17.824
Hand over your stethoscope.

13:18.864 --> 13:19.831
What?

13:19.932 --> 13:22.799
In victory, I get your stethoscope.
It's a trophy.

13:22.868 --> 13:26.201
Back in olden times, I'd have made
a necklace out of your teeth.

13:26.272 --> 13:29.036
I find this highly unprofessional.

13:29.942 --> 13:32.968
Now, I'm going to check on Mr. Jenkins,
your war hero.

13:33.045 --> 13:35.707
I feel he, too,
deserves a competent doctor.

13:35.781 --> 13:38.341
In fact, I'm gonna take
all of your patients.

13:38.417 --> 13:39.384
And consequently,

13:39.485 --> 13:42.818
your only reason for getting out
of that lacy, over-pillowed,

13:42.888 --> 13:46.756
four-poster virgin cocoon
you call a bed every morning.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.823
Gotta get Mrs. Wilk back.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.530
Who gave her a shade remote?

13:54.633 --> 13:57.295
I didn't even know
we had shade remotes.

14:00.940 --> 14:04.842
Aww, either your picture didn't come
out, or we're full of vampire doctors.

14:04.910 --> 14:08.607
<i>[J.D.] Vampire doctors?</i>
<i>How did he hear about my screenplay?</i>

14:09.048 --> 14:11.710
I don't know why you did it,
but I know it was you.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.911
- How?
- Because it's always you.

14:13.986 --> 14:17.422
- It's not always me!
- [Man screaming]

14:17.489 --> 14:19.650
[Crashing]

14:19.725 --> 14:24.162
Who the hell put tiny wheels
on my shoes?

14:24.230 --> 14:26.596
That's his fault.
He took a nap in the lounge.

14:26.699 --> 14:30.829
Why would you ruin this for me?
I didn't even ask you to be there!

14:30.903 --> 14:32.063
Imagine that.

14:32.171 --> 14:35.538
I've been here 13 years,
and I don't rate as part of the family.

14:35.641 --> 14:37.506
Did you want to be in the picture?

14:37.576 --> 14:41.068
No. It's just... I don't...
Who... It's...

14:41.146 --> 14:42.773
I gotta go.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.519
I actually love these.

14:49.121 --> 14:52.090
Miss Brooks,
your blood work looks fine.

14:52.858 --> 14:56.385
But I'd like to take one more sample,
just for me.

14:59.698 --> 15:03.327
- [Sucking sounds]
- [Moaning]

15:07.640 --> 15:11.167
You taste a little anemic.
Get that down to the lab, buddy.

15:11.243 --> 15:15.202
- Right away, Dr. Acula.
- It's what they call me.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.839
How you doing?

15:16.949 --> 15:18.314
The end.

15:18.384 --> 15:22.013
So Dr. Acula is a doctor and a vampire?

15:22.087 --> 15:24.055
He's both.
And at the very end,

15:24.123 --> 15:27.092
I'm gonna put "Dr. Acula"
across the screen,

15:27.192 --> 15:29.422
take that period,
get it out of there,

15:29.495 --> 15:33.591
squish it together,
it'll say "Dracula."

15:33.666 --> 15:35.190
That is an awesome ending!

15:35.267 --> 15:38.327
Um, thank you for telling me
what I already know, Turk.

15:42.141 --> 15:45.304
Frick! It's Mrs. Peele!
One of us has to talk to her.

15:45.411 --> 15:49.347
First one to chug their Slushee
is off the hook. Come on! Here we go!

15:49.748 --> 15:52.512
[Screams]

15:54.019 --> 15:56.249
Brain freeze!

15:56.322 --> 15:58.950
Why is my husband being discharged?

15:59.024 --> 16:02.187
- Mrs. Peele, we really could not...
- [piercing scream]

16:02.294 --> 16:03.818
Turk, come on!

16:04.029 --> 16:06.463
It's so cold!

16:06.799 --> 16:11.361
Mrs. Peele, even though Dr. Turk
is incapacitated by his beverage,

16:11.437 --> 16:14.201
- he is a fantastic surgeon.
- Uh-huh.

16:14.273 --> 16:17.242
And he didn't find anything.
And I am a great doctor...

16:17.309 --> 16:20.574
- Nyahhh.
...and I didn't either.

16:21.580 --> 16:24.743
Don't you think that maybe
the pain could all be in his head?

16:24.817 --> 16:26.978
Last week, we were all watching TV

16:27.052 --> 16:30.078
and he was in too much pain
to get up and use the bathroom,

16:30.155 --> 16:33.318
so he soiled himself on the couch
right in front of our son.

16:33.425 --> 16:34.756
How do you explain that?

16:35.394 --> 16:38.329
Maybe there was a good game
on television.

16:40.099 --> 16:41.430
Probably not.

Hey, sport!

17:01.320 --> 17:02.981
[Grunting]

17:04.823 --> 17:06.882
You just lit your pipe
on my title page.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.483
I heard Mrs. Wilk gave you the axe.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.461
She said, "I've led a great life,"

17:11.530 --> 17:14.863
and every doctor knows
that's code for "I'm ready to die."

17:14.933 --> 17:16.992
How old do you think I am, Dorian?

17:17.069 --> 17:20.698
<i>There's no way to answer and not</i>
<i>get in trouble. Change the subject.</i>

17:20.772 --> 17:24.675
Sir, I would be honored if you
and Enid would join me on Sunday

17:24.742 --> 17:26.869
for some homemade jambalaya.

17:26.944 --> 17:30.039
Well, it would be good for Enid
to get out of the house.

17:30.115 --> 17:33.141
<i>My God! He's thinking about it.</i>
<i>Change the subject back!</i>

17:33.218 --> 17:35.186
You're 78, sir.

17:35.287 --> 17:38.051
- You think I'm that old?
- Jambalaya.

17:38.123 --> 17:40.489
- I'm 57, numbnuts.
- Really?

17:40.592 --> 17:43.561
- I know they say 57 is the new 40...
- Who?

17:43.662 --> 17:47.621
...but it seems all people see when they
look in my direction is some old guy.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.958
I was in the mall
hanging out at Brookstone

17:51.036 --> 17:53.129
and some kid asked me if I was lost.

17:53.205 --> 17:55.833
Brookstone.
Were you looking for gadgets, sir?

17:55.908 --> 17:59.241
If that's what you call
trolling for mall ass, then yeah.

17:59.311 --> 18:04.010
The point is, you think Mrs. Wilk
is old enough to die.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.916
I'm betting she doesn't agree.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.382
How am I supposed to know
the Janitor has feelings?

18:12.491 --> 18:14.220
We should've believed Mr. Peele.

18:14.293 --> 18:17.194
It's not like somebody
poos their pants for no reason.

18:17.262 --> 18:21.028
- Turk did that in college on a bet.
- Carla did not know that story.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.067
Thank you.

18:22.167 --> 18:25.796
<i>Sometimes when you feel guilty,</i>
<i>it's a storm cloud over your head.</i>

18:25.871 --> 18:29.637

- [Wind howling]

18:38.417 --> 18:41.386
<i>I knew there was only one way</i>
<i>to make the guilt storm go away.</i>

18:41.487 --> 18:44.047
Mrs. Wilk, I'm sorry.

18:49.394 --> 18:51.954
Mrs. Wilk, I just wanted to say
I was wrong

18:52.030 --> 18:55.591
to think you wouldn't want to try
every possible treatment there is

18:55.701 --> 18:57.931
to avoid, you know...

18:58.003 --> 19:00.301
...the place with...

19:00.739 --> 19:05.108
You know, there's clouds
and the Space Needle...

19:05.878 --> 19:07.140
Seattle.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.736
Yes, you were.

19:09.515 --> 19:11.415
But thank you.

19:12.284 --> 19:13.911
You're welcome.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.452
You got a lot of pluck
for an older gal.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.491
How old do you think I am?

19:19.558 --> 19:20.923
Jambalaya!

19:20.993 --> 19:23.325
<i>There are a lot of ways</i>
<i>to make amends.</i>

19:25.063 --> 19:27.964
<i>It can be as simple</i>
<i>as including someone...</i>

19:29.735 --> 19:30.895
Hey.

19:32.804 --> 19:34.704
I want you to be in the picture.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.509
[Whimpers]

19:43.649 --> 19:44.980
[Cracking]

19:47.819 --> 19:51.084
- I thought you were trying to kill me.
- I fought the urge.

19:51.823 --> 19:54.553
- OK.
- Thanks.

19:54.626 --> 19:57.789
<i>... or as complicated</i>
<i>as committing to a difficult journey.</i>

19:57.863 --> 20:00.696
Mr. Peele, we believe your pain's real.

20:00.766 --> 20:03.701
And you're not going anywhere
until we figure it out.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.365
Thank you.

20:09.741 --> 20:12.710
<i>The important thing is to regain</i>
<i>the respect of your peers.</i>

20:12.811 --> 20:16.042
Say, Newbie,
I, uh, I gotta hand it to you.

20:16.114 --> 20:19.413
It took the heart of a lion
to apologize to Mrs. Wilk like that.

20:19.484 --> 20:20.451
Thank you.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.180
It took the incompetence
of a bewildered jackass

20:23.255 --> 20:24.950
to make that error to begin with.

20:25.023 --> 20:27.992
You never make assumptions
based on your own perceptions.

20:28.093 --> 20:29.856
- Just never do it.
- Really?

20:29.962 --> 20:32.988
You've been spending time
treating my guy, Mr. Jenkins?

20:33.065 --> 20:35.192
He's a veteran.
He deserves as much.

20:35.267 --> 20:36.996
He's just a homeless guy.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.799
I made up the war veteran story
to motivate my boys.

20:39.871 --> 20:41.930
But, what are you gonna do?

20:42.007 --> 20:44.532
Oh, come on.
You've gotten me like 100 times.

20:44.610 --> 20:47.511
I finally got you once.
It was bound to happen, right?

20:47.579 --> 20:51.106
I see your point.
Kindly blow it out your ass.

20:54.486 --> 20:56.954
- How did you get them to come down?
- Fear.

20:57.623 --> 20:58.954
OK, everybody.

20:59.024 --> 21:02.585
One, two, three!

21:02.661 --> 21:05.425
