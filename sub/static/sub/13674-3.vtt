00:07.008 --> 00:08.999
(J‘ Slowjazz on piano and violin)

00:11.053 --> 00:12.964
(Car horns honking)

00:20.396 --> 00:23.354
— (Dishes clinking)
— (Food sizzling)

00:23.482 --> 00:25.063
(Man) Duok's ready for veg.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.683
(Janette) All right, let's sauce it.

00:26.819 --> 00:29.356
(Chefs chattering)

00:39.373 --> 00:41.409
(Mutters)

00:43.336 --> 00:45.622
(Whispering)

00:47.381 --> 00:49.497
J‘ Better stash that J‘

00:49.634 --> 00:52.546
J‘ Don't be surprised
if she asks where the cash at J‘

00:52.678 --> 00:55.340
J‘ | see she wearing them jeans

00:59.560 --> 01:01.596
Hey, brah, I'm going uptown.
You can handle that?

01:01.729 --> 01:04.562
— Remember me?
— Hey, man, fuck you.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.359
Motherfucker.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.274
(Laughs)

01:20.414 --> 01:22.405
Oh!

01:31.133 --> 01:32.998
(Doorbell dings)

02:16.804 --> 02:18.089
Toni Bernette.

02:28.024 --> 02:30.982
(People chattering)

02:33.029 --> 02:35.862
(Music continues)

04:31.981 --> 04:35.519
— What did the call come out as?
— Call? There was no call on it.

04:35.651 --> 04:39.314
Communications was pretty spotty —
108s and in-progress stuff only.

04:39.822 --> 04:42.108
They weren't transmitting
ordinary calls for service.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.777
So how did you end up here?

04:43.909 --> 04:46.742
A guy flags me on Basin Street,
tells me about a body here.

04:46.871 --> 04:49.408
Not my district, but what the hell?

04:49.540 --> 04:53.283
I figure the least I can do is mark the spot
for whenever the world comes back online.

04:53.419 --> 04:55.455
About how many days into it?

04:55.588 --> 04:59.547
Three, maybe four, maybe five.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.631
Days kind of blended together, you know.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.887
Yeah. What time?

05:04.013 --> 05:08.052
Late morning,
maybe 10:00, 11:00, around then.

05:08.184 --> 05:12.268
I pull up, a couple dozen assholes,
black and white, walking out of there.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.808
They got whiskey, beer, cigarettes.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.271
ljump out at them.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.356
And you see the kid Abreu laying out here.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.147
Out here?

05:20.279 --> 05:21.735
lnside.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.905
Inside?

05:25.034 --> 05:27.150
Well, the family was told on the street...

05:27.286 --> 05:29.072
Marais Street actually.

05:29.205 --> 05:31.196
Marais Street? Nah.

05:31.332 --> 05:36.076
He's inside, laying over a shelf which
must have got pulled down in the looting.

05:36.212 --> 05:38.669
The body was going ripe actually.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.840
Inside this store.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.881
I think it was right there.
That's how I wrote it up.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.380
Whoa, whoa, you wrote a report on it?

05:49.517 --> 05:51.382
I didn't have any RTFs.

05:51.519 --> 05:55.683
Crazy—shit time it was, we were using them
for toilet paper, I swear to God.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.315
So no report?

05:57.441 --> 06:00.148
Well, there was a package of paper plates
laying there by the kid.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.484
So I grab one, lwrite it up.

06:02.613 --> 06:05.571
A white male, early 20s,

06:05.699 --> 06:07.564
dark hair, blue eyes,

06:07.701 --> 06:09.566
six feet maybe,

06:09.703 --> 06:11.955
About 160—165, a skinny dude.

06:12.081 --> 06:15.073
No visible scars,
tattoos, what—have—you.

06:15.209 --> 06:16.870
Driver's license says he's, uh...

06:17.002 --> 06:19.869
— Joseph Abreu.
- Right.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.870
Gunshot wound to head.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.872
Gunshot wound?

06:24.009 --> 06:25.749
So the kid was shot?

06:25.886 --> 06:28.172
Of course he's shot.
I had casings — three on the floor.

06:28.305 --> 06:31.422
— Wait, you found bullet casings here?
— Three.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.845
Either nine mil or .380 from the look.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.390
But this isn't a homicide, right?

06:37.523 --> 06:39.605
DMORT pended it.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.348
If you say so.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.350
lt's above my pay grade.

06:43.487 --> 06:45.023
| just wrote up what I had

06:45.155 --> 06:47.862
and handed it to my captain
along with the casings.

06:47.992 --> 06:50.779
Captain laughs his ass off
when I hand him the plate.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.595
Yeah.

07:12.725 --> 07:14.306
That's about all we rehearsed.

07:14.435 --> 07:18.053
Listen, we could play everything again.
Nobody would know the difference.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.689
You should finish the set solo.

07:19.815 --> 07:22.101
I'm gonna look at some pictures
and listen for a while.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.020
OK, cool.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.201
(Woman) Hey.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.252

07:52.389 --> 07:55.131

07:55.267 --> 07:58.009
Double espresso, a Coca—Cola,
Scotch neat,

07:58.145 --> 07:59.806

07:59.938 --> 08:01.348
Mm.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.518
— Now you done made her angry.
- She's always angry.

08:03.651 --> 08:06.563
So for tonight, you planning on playing
everything from the new album

08:06.695 --> 08:09.528

08:09.657 --> 08:13.024
Nah, play it all. Just give me something with
your left hand to fill it out on Friend.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.115

— Uh—huh.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.373
Y'all read that Downbeat review?

08:21.502 --> 08:23.663

08:23.796 --> 08:27.004
About the only ones.
Soundscan reading out 60% national coverage.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.668
So far 2,300 sales.

08:28.801 --> 08:31.008
Now you want to be
popular or acclaimed?

08:31.136 --> 08:34.628
That dude in the Downbeat — what did
he call you? A postmodern Coltrane.

08:34.765 --> 08:35.971
(Laughter)

08:36.100 --> 08:39.308
Yeah, you, quote, serve up
a chilly brew, unquote.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.097
Oh no, man. I don't write this shit.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.391
Direct quote from the bartender —

08:43.524 --> 08:46.891
"Fumble—nuts and his bucanero
can go fuck each other."

08:47.027 --> 08:50.110

09:34.575 --> 09:35.530
(Keyboard plays note)

09:35.659 --> 09:37.069

09:48.589 --> 09:51.456

09:54.928 --> 09:57.761
Brah, it's B—flat.
I know what I'm fucking reading.

09:57.890 --> 10:00.302
Man, are you talking B—flat concert

10:00.434 --> 10:02.345
Oh, you mean concert. My bad.

10:02.478 --> 10:05.436
Man, you motherfuckers sound

10:05.564 --> 10:07.555
- Now come on.
— Well, if we had decent charts...

10:07.691 --> 10:09.556
Man, listen, lwould have
had Wardell's charts here,

10:09.693 --> 10:11.194
but I asked
Andrew Lloyd—Webber instead.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.026
— They're still waiting.
- (Laughter)

10:13.155 --> 10:14.986
Oh, I can tell right now
I'm putting together a band

10:15.115 --> 10:17.572
with some contrary motherfuckers.
Just use your ears, brah.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.657
Say, brah, get off the phone, brah.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.823
- You can call them back.
— I'm on the fucking phone.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.742
Voicemail, motherfucker.
Tell them to go to it.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.116
— (Loud laughter)

10:27.252 --> 10:29.413
Man, count it off, Ray. Shit.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.881
(Horns clashing)

10:35.010 --> 10:37.217

10:37.346 --> 10:39.302
Hold on.
Lay out, lay out, lay out.

10:39.431 --> 10:40.887
(Horns only)

B—flat.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.843
B—flat!

10:47.314 --> 10:49.179
There, that's it, that's it.
Come on, come on.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.726
(Bass and keyboard join in)

10:50.859 --> 10:54.568
J‘ Sneakin' Sally through the alley

10:54.696 --> 10:57.312
J‘ She ain't got no drums... J‘

10:57.449 --> 10:59.405
(Horn blaring)

10:59.535 --> 11:01.696
(Seagulls screeching)

11:06.750 --> 11:08.206
Aw, man.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.836
lt's crowded like this every day?

11:09.962 --> 11:11.543
Some days better than others.

11:11.672 --> 11:16.086
Shit, what you gonna do when you got
one ash can to dump half the city into?

11:17.678 --> 11:19.760
Ain't no other dump open?

11:19.888 --> 11:22.721
We was dumping everything

11:25.519 --> 11:28.682
till they closed that dump,

11:28.814 --> 11:31.055
And this bitch been closed since '86.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.103
Now they're dumping shit

11:34.236 --> 11:36.818
Now tell me that ain't gonna fuck shit up.

11:36.947 --> 11:39.609
Fools making it up as they go along.

11:39.741 --> 11:42.824
The paper plate? Yeah, I remember.
How am I gonna forget that?

11:42.953 --> 11:46.116
So a report was made
on Joseph Abreu?

11:46.248 --> 11:48.830
— The shooting victim from the store, right?
- Yeah.

11:48.959 --> 11:51.575
Yeah, I Frisbee'd it over
to the First District.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.668
The body was discovered in the First.

11:53.797 --> 11:56.163
— It was their catch.
— Did you call Homicide?

11:56.300 --> 11:59.508
It was for them to liaison. You gotta remember
there were bodies everywhere.

12:03.181 --> 12:05.012
Thanks for this.

12:05.976 --> 12:09.685
The man gave me the job on the promise
l'd haul the old shit away.

12:11.106 --> 12:15.475
You got your appointment tomorrow,
don't you? That Road to Home shit?

12:15.611 --> 12:17.818
The day after, 2:00pm.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.232
And it's Road Home.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.114
What?

12:24.161 --> 12:26.618
The program — it's not Road to Home.
It's Road Home.

12:26.747 --> 12:29.614
Man, it says www.roadtohome,

12:29.750 --> 12:31.866

12:34.087 --> 12:37.796
I'm gonna go with Road Home. And we'll see

12:40.093 --> 12:41.299

— They got this one cop,

12:41.428 --> 12:42.964
he's on the hunt for any funeral
without permits,

12:43.096 --> 12:45.587
chasing everybody away
unless they slip him some street bail.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.009
Which motherfucker is this?

12:47.142 --> 12:48.848
The one with the buzz cut,
looks like the marine.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.308
Him, yeah.

12:50.437 --> 12:54.680
Unless they bring the permit fees back down,
there ain't gonna be no more parade.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.148
I know. The city's gone crazy since
them shootings in January.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.939
Clubs suing the city, right?
Trying to get them to drop their fees.

13:00.072 --> 13:02.028
By the time it goes to court, who knows?

13:02.157 --> 13:04.273
Would you listen to that, man?

13:04.409 --> 13:07.071
Man, Derrick's smoking on that, man.

13:07.204 --> 13:11.413
Dinerral, I still see you sitting across the street
in the play lot, half—pint you be,

13:11.541 --> 13:13.998
rat—a—tat—tatting on a plastic five—gallon,

13:14.127 --> 13:16.618
feathering a trash lid for a high—hat.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.086
Antoine Batiste.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.500
— Fuck that.
— (LaDonna) Oh!

13:19.633 --> 13:24.502
Triple Jameson. For the next 10 minutes
I don't need none of your bullshit, please.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.472
City of music — I can't even find a tenor sax

13:28.600 --> 13:30.636
who knows how to transpose
keys in his head.

13:30.769 --> 13:31.849
(Laughs)

13:31.979 --> 13:33.185
LaDonna.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.770
— I ain't said a damn thing.
— Don't.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.106
Hey, Antoine, you're in my bar.

13:38.235 --> 13:42.274
Which is another thing. ljust got a band
put together and we need some gigs.

13:42.406 --> 13:44.317
Seems to me I heard talk

13:44.449 --> 13:47.691
that you were thinking about getting
some live music up in here.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.114
I might let you audition.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.953
Audition? Never!

13:52.082 --> 13:53.947
(Laughing)

13:54.084 --> 13:56.040
(Song playing on radio)

14:10.726 --> 14:12.717
(Song stops)

14:43.800 --> 14:44.880
(Rustling)

14:45.010 --> 14:46.841
Who's that?

14:46.970 --> 14:48.676
(Thuds)

14:48.805 --> 14:50.796
Who's that? Anybody there?

14:59.399 --> 15:02.266
This is the police.
Anybody up there?

15:06.031 --> 15:09.523
I'm a cop with a gun, seriously!

15:10.577 --> 15:12.613
(Thud)

15:14.581 --> 15:19.200
Every 30 minutes, so that the rest of you
can idle your SUVs in rush hour,

15:19.336 --> 15:23.079
we lose a football field's worth of land
to the Gulf of Mexico.

15:23.215 --> 15:25.831
But God forbid the Federal Government

15:25.967 --> 15:28.049
should let us negotiate
higher leasing fees

15:28.178 --> 15:30.214
with these fucking greedheads.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.464
Today it's the wetlands
and oil companies.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.465
Yesterday she was ranting about

15:35.602 --> 15:39.595
how the Humane Society is spending more
on relocating dogs and cats

15:39.731 --> 15:42.347
than Nagin is spending
on getting people's electric back on.

15:42.484 --> 15:43.815
And the profanity...

15:43.944 --> 15:46.811
— Giving voice to her father.
- I'm sure she is.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.232
And I'd let her run with it,

15:48.365 --> 15:52.825
but the more I do,
the more she seems to turn on me.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.113
Maybe a change of venue.

15:54.246 --> 15:55.736
I'm open to suggestions.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.783
The zoo always looking for volunteers.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.827
She's a free—the—beasts advocate.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.076
Politics, then. An internship,

16:02.212 --> 16:05.329
maybe City Hall or the courthouse
or one of the other agencies.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.878
Lusher has a volunteer
requirement, right?

16:09.010 --> 16:11.467
I know Oliver Thomas pretty well.

16:11.596 --> 16:15.714
Yeah, President of the City Council should
be able to manage an unpaid internship.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.716
I'll make a call.

16:17.853 --> 16:19.844
Do it now.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.595
(Desiree) Day after tomorrow,
3:00 sharp,

16:21.731 --> 16:23.187
Theophile Jones Elie Elementary.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.568
You're interviewing with the head bandleader,
so wear your tie.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.275
I pressed your suit.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.895
I'm putting a band together, Desiree.
You know how I am.

16:30.031 --> 16:32.238
I need to concentrate
on one task at a time.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.153
You're going to get this job, Antoine.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.197
Assistant bandleader,
$24,000 a year.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.321
I might could make that much in half the time
once we start getting the gigs.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.197
If this band happens, you might get gigs.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.791
But even then, that's off—the—books
cash money, Antoine.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.502
And we've got to show the bank
we got real salaries to qualify.

16:46.631 --> 16:47.666
Yeah, baby, but I...

16:47.799 --> 16:49.790
Get this school job.
Between your salary and mine

16:49.926 --> 16:51.882
we'd more than qualify for a home loan.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.879
Or do you want us all the way out here
in this dump forever?

16:55.015 --> 16:56.425
Damn.

16:56.558 --> 16:57.889
(Quietly)
l'll dump your ass.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.100
Shit. Please?

17:00.228 --> 17:03.470
I mean, I'll look, but there's no way
I can tell what's missing.

17:03.607 --> 17:07.395
(Janette) Fuck me.
This can't be happening. It never ends.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.860
— I'll try to get down there tomorrow.
- Yeah, you should.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.776
lwill. Bye.

17:26.004 --> 17:29.167
Chef, l have a problem
back home in New Orleans.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.506
My house was broken into.

17:31.635 --> 17:36.095
And l have to take tomorrow off,
get a flight down there and deal.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.430
I can be back the day after.

17:39.434 --> 17:43.302
You know, you made
a commitment to be here.

17:43.438 --> 17:46.225
More important, you made
a personal commitment to me

17:46.358 --> 17:48.519
and to the people you work with to be here.

17:48.652 --> 17:52.065
— Chef, everything I own...
— Do l have a life?

17:52.781 --> 17:55.113
This is my life.

17:55.242 --> 17:58.200
Commitment. That's all | ask.

17:58.328 --> 18:01.161
l have to file a report with the police.
The insurance won't...

18:01.289 --> 18:05.157
You know, I can teach skills.
I can teach people how to cook.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.249
Character —

18:07.379 --> 18:08.915
that, I can't teach.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.039
Go. Go to New Orleans.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.632
Do your... whatever it is.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.797
Thank you, Chef. I'll be back Friday.

18:18.974 --> 18:21.181
(Song playing on jukebox)

18:36.866 --> 18:38.857
(Knocking)

18:42.372 --> 18:44.033
(Music stops)

18:44.165 --> 18:46.030
(Loud knocking)

18:46.167 --> 18:48.579
Closed. Closed.

18:48.712 --> 18:51.499
Nah, I'm lost. I'm looking for this place
that's called Sidney's.

18:51.631 --> 18:55.044
Sidney's? You want to head back
to Saint Bernard, turn left.

18:55.176 --> 18:57.007
lt's down there where Saint Claude
come in.

18:57.137 --> 19:01.346
— Saint Claude?
— Yeah, but they're closed about now too.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.510
I'm supposed to meet
my family down there.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.055
They're supposed to have a band playing
for my daddy's birthday.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.688
On Wednesdays?

19:07.814 --> 19:10.180
I don't think they have
live music on Wednesdays.

19:10.317 --> 19:13.024
You think I could use your phone to call
down there to see if they're still there?

19:13.153 --> 19:16.236
— Got no phone, mm—mm.
- You got a cell phone?

19:16.364 --> 19:18.525
— What's your name?
- Mike.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.274
— Your family name.
— Last name?

19:21.411 --> 19:23.026
Yeah, family.

19:23.163 --> 19:26.075
Oh, you mean my daddy?
Mike, same as mine.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.827
Tell you what.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.459
I'm gonna call NOPD,

19:31.588 --> 19:34.204
get them to come out here
and help you out, all right?

19:34.341 --> 19:36.047
(Phone ringing)

19:36.176 --> 19:38.041
Nah, that's all right.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.464
(Woman) 911, what's your emergency?

19:40.597 --> 19:44.806
Yeah, I'd like a police car
out to my place. Gigi's.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.061
Corner of Annette and Urquhart.

19:47.187 --> 19:50.475
- Your name is Gigi?
— No, my name is not Gigi.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.598
Someone out by my door.
He don't look right.

19:52.734 --> 19:56.773
— Ma'am, that's a separate number.
— I know the number for non—emergencies.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.270
(Girl) Hey, Miss LaDee.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.647
OK, ma'am, please tell me
that address again.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.399
(Phone beeps)

20:27.769 --> 20:30.010
Hey, you said
Saint Claude and what now?

20:31.815 --> 20:34.477
You head back to Saint Bernard,

20:34.609 --> 20:36.224
two blocks...

20:46.329 --> 20:48.115
The fuck you think you're doing?

20:48.248 --> 20:49.784
Get out!

20:49.916 --> 20:51.998
Get out! Get out!

20:56.339 --> 20:58.330
OK, take it. Take everything.

20:58.466 --> 21:01.048
There's $200 in there.
Just take it and leave.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.921
Get the fuck up out of here.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.174
You hear me? Get!

21:09.310 --> 21:10.766
Nah.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.886
Mm—hm.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.273
Get the fuck out!

21:17.402 --> 21:19.358
Get the fuck up out of here.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.361
(Music playing)

21:34.169 --> 21:37.002
J‘ Every time | close my eyes

21:37.130 --> 21:41.043
J‘ I seem to see Louisiana

21:41.176 --> 21:44.339
J‘ I can hear those people singing

21:44.471 --> 21:48.214
J‘ In that free and easy manner

21:48.349 --> 21:51.341
J‘ I've been a rover, now that's all over

21:51.478 --> 21:55.141
J‘ Beneath the clover I'll soon be found

21:55.273 --> 21:58.481
J‘ I'm on my way now,
just any day now

21:58.610 --> 22:01.317
J‘ l'm delta bound J‘

22:04.199 --> 22:06.110
(Applause)

22:09.204 --> 22:11.866
The band's gonna take a little break right now
and have a drink.

22:11.998 --> 22:15.161
Hope you'll do the same.
We'll be right back.

22:16.211 --> 22:19.169
- Good set.
— You just walked in, motherfucker.

22:19.297 --> 22:21.003
You got me.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.754
You know anyone looking
for guitar or piano?

22:24.886 --> 22:26.797
I gotta get my ass off Royal Street.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.215
What are you looking for?

22:28.348 --> 22:31.840
Anything — blues, R&B,
country, folk, bluegrass,

22:31.976 --> 22:34.558
gospel, kids' parties,
Viking funerals, whatever.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.643
Have you tried posting
at the music exchange?

22:36.773 --> 22:38.104
Two weeks ago.

22:38.233 --> 22:40.440
Man, I don't know. I'll ask around though.

22:46.115 --> 22:48.276
(Distant siren wailing)

23:03.091 --> 23:05.673
(Sirens wailing)

23:05.802 --> 23:07.667
I need help.

23:07.804 --> 23:10.637
Can someone please help me?
This woman is hurt.

23:13.268 --> 23:14.633
What happened?

23:14.769 --> 23:16.680
Don't know. The door to her bar was open.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.929
I went inside and found her laying there.

23:19.065 --> 23:22.228
— What happened, honey?
— Is there anywhere I can set her down?

23:22.360 --> 23:25.272
Anywhere?
Please, she's bleeding.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.316
Jordan, get me a wheelchair.

23:27.448 --> 23:29.905
(People shouting)

23:30.034 --> 23:32.525
Look, I apologize
and it's not necessary,

23:32.662 --> 23:36.120
but I have to ask — you know if she carries
any type of insurance?

23:47.176 --> 23:49.337
(Police radio chatter)

23:53.558 --> 23:55.549
(Policeman) Police! Search warrant!

23:55.685 --> 23:58.768
- (Music playing)
- (Policemen shouting)

24:08.239 --> 24:10.150
(Object crashes, music stops)

24:15.538 --> 24:18.245
If you got anything that's gonna stick,
please say so now.

24:28.051 --> 24:30.212
(People chattering)

24:31.929 --> 24:34.671
— Shh.
— I need something. It hurts bad.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.844
(Woman) Call CT. Cecile's back
and she's not alone.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.810
No, no, no. Cecile, get him out of here.

24:40.938 --> 24:43.350
He can't tell the difference
between night and day.

24:43.483 --> 24:47.067
Out. You keep bringing these crazies in, you're
taking up all the beds for the sick people.

24:47.195 --> 24:50.062
He's hallucinating.
His blood pressure is 190/100.

24:50.198 --> 24:53.235
Sir... Sir, are you OK?

24:53.368 --> 24:54.699
Yes, ma'am, l'm OK.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.658
He says he's fine.
You take him home.

24:56.788 --> 24:59.780
You leave him here, I'm walking him
right back out the door.

25:01.417 --> 25:04.204
I can't give you anything till I get
doctor's orders. | wish I could.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.248
- (Nurse) Sir.
— LaDonna. What the hell?

25:06.381 --> 25:08.337
— Excuse me, sir, you can't be in here.
- I'm her husband.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.502
What happened, baby?

25:11.302 --> 25:14.089
Why wasn't I called right away?
How long has she been here like this?

25:14.222 --> 25:17.885
She came in very disoriented. We called as
soon as she was able to give us a number.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.176
Nothing's broken,

25:21.312 --> 25:24.054
but, Mrs. Williams, I'm going to need...

25:24.190 --> 25:25.930
- Who are you?
— l'm her husband.

25:26.067 --> 25:28.524
Good. Good you're here with your wife.

25:28.653 --> 25:31.395
But for the moment I'm gonna have to ask you
to please step outside.

25:31.531 --> 25:33.522
- I'm staying right here.
— Sir, I need you to step...

25:33.658 --> 25:35.444
God damn it, I am not moving!

25:37.870 --> 25:41.533
Please, Larry. It's OK. Please.

25:52.969 --> 25:57.133
Mrs. Williams, would you allow me
to examine you for sexual assault?

26:02.729 --> 26:04.890
(Distant dog barking)

27:00.787 --> 27:04.200
You'll feel a little pressure inside.

27:17.345 --> 27:21.088
OK, take slow, deep breaths.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.809
(Man on radio) The board is full, Bobby,
all the way to Miami.

27:30.942 --> 27:33.900
(Bobby) That's right. I'll tell you,
you're one of the best Saints fans.

27:34.028 --> 27:35.814
You're always optimistic.

27:37.865 --> 27:40.072
Jesus on the cross, you're fast.

27:40.201 --> 27:43.364
Those other crews are at least a week from
finishing, and you're done a week early.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.361
You said you'd have some more for me.

27:45.498 --> 27:47.363
I can get more, no problem.

27:47.500 --> 27:52.870
In fact, how about for you
a bigger proposition?

27:53.005 --> 27:54.506
I'm listening.

27:54.632 --> 27:56.338
Let's do this over drinks,

27:56.467 --> 27:58.799
Hotel L'Espere, 7:00 tonight?

28:00.096 --> 28:02.212
And don't run late. I got dinner plans.

28:06.644 --> 28:08.509
Sorry to keep you waiting.

28:08.646 --> 28:11.888
Third shift had a bad night
and we're still cleaning up for them.

28:12.817 --> 28:17.060
I talked to the officer on my Abreu kid,
took him back to the scene, in fact.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.697
And?

28:18.823 --> 28:20.654
Kid's found dead inside a store,

28:20.783 --> 28:22.648
nowhere near Marais Street,

28:22.785 --> 28:24.776
and he's shot to death.

28:27.081 --> 28:30.494
The officer found three casings
and he wrote up a report on it.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.787
Get this — on a paper plate.

28:32.920 --> 28:37.038
He hands it to his captain, who says he sent it
over to the First District where it belonged.

28:37.174 --> 28:38.880
And you checked with the First?

28:39.010 --> 28:42.127
Not so easy to do.
The captain who commands over there,

28:42.263 --> 28:45.255
l sued him five, six years ago
for profiling on traffic stops.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.632
Of course you did!

28:47.768 --> 28:50.976
They told the family
he was found on the street.

28:51.105 --> 28:53.437
No one says anything about any shooting.

28:53.566 --> 28:55.852
Well, the kid's looting maybe, takes a bullet.

28:55.985 --> 28:58.727
Someone says less than he should,
trying to spare the family.

28:58.863 --> 29:00.603
Yeah.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.276
Maybe, but...

29:02.408 --> 29:04.569
But what?

29:05.244 --> 29:07.485
You should have seen that father's face.

29:07.622 --> 29:09.704
No one spared him anything.

29:12.793 --> 29:14.954
They took everything —

29:16.297 --> 29:21.291
my purse, my phone,

29:21.427 --> 29:24.169
— my keys, everything.
- Rest, babe.

29:24.305 --> 29:27.297
Shh, rest, OK?

29:27.433 --> 29:30.425
(Cell phone ringing)

29:32.104 --> 29:34.140
I gotta get this.

29:38.194 --> 29:39.400
Yeah?

29:40.321 --> 29:42.277
No, no, we're still at the hospital.

29:42.406 --> 29:47.070
Look, don't tell her mother or the boys.
I'll talk to them when | get back, OK?

29:49.288 --> 29:50.744
Ma'am, l'm Detective Leroy.

29:50.873 --> 29:53.410
I'm gonna need to talk to you
if you're ready to do that.

29:55.378 --> 29:56.788
Not now.

29:56.921 --> 30:00.129
Ma'am, the sooner I'm able
to get information...

30:00.257 --> 30:02.088
I can't.

30:02.218 --> 30:04.209
Not now.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.716
I'll come back in a little while.

30:55.396 --> 30:57.808
Tore through my shit good.

30:59.942 --> 31:01.853
Had plenty of time,

31:01.986 --> 31:04.898
considering how long
it took the cops to get here.

31:14.790 --> 31:18.248
Is there anything I can do? Y'know?

31:25.676 --> 31:27.212
On a plate? Come on.

31:27.344 --> 31:29.801
5D officer wrote it up on a paper plate.

31:29.930 --> 31:31.841
Something you'd remember.

31:31.974 --> 31:34.135
Came over to you guys
from Malatesta at 5D.

31:34.268 --> 31:37.101
— I got nothing on it.
— Prioleau in Homicide has the file now.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.641
It's not a homicide.
DMORT pended the thing.

31:39.774 --> 31:41.059
Then talk to Prioleau.

31:41.192 --> 31:44.935
l have. They got no plate report,
got no casings, nothing from you guys.

31:45.071 --> 31:48.359
First call they got was from an ambo unit
for a decomp body only.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.945
This is for that bitch, ain't it?

31:52.078 --> 31:55.241
— She fucking sued me, you know.
- Well...

31:55.372 --> 31:57.363
She's a scab puller.

31:57.500 --> 32:00.833
Whatever fits into some grand conspiracy
is all she wants to know.

32:02.129 --> 32:06.122
— She say we got a report and casings?
— Yeah.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.842
She still thinks Kennedy was whacked
by the Marcellos and LBJ.

32:09.970 --> 32:14.464
And you're gonna carry water for her?
Shame on you, Terry.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.017
(Lively music playing)

32:31.117 --> 32:33.153
No, no, no. Hold, hold, hold. Hold up.

32:33.285 --> 32:36.869
No, brah, it's... J‘ Bap—ba, bap—ba...

32:36.997 --> 32:40.831
- That's what I'm playing.
— No, brah, it's... J‘ Bap—ba, bap—ba...

32:40.960 --> 32:42.871
No, I'm playing...

32:43.003 --> 32:44.834
(Plays with different phrasing)

32:44.964 --> 32:47.706
— Yeah, I know. That's what we're saying.
- No, I'm playing...

32:48.384 --> 32:50.750
(Plays with different phrasing)

32:50.886 --> 32:52.922
No, brah. Show him, dawg.

32:55.641 --> 32:58.053
No, no, no, hold up, hold up.
That shit ain't right either.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.971
— Motherfucker, man.
- What?

33:00.104 --> 33:03.267
Say, brah, I know you didn'tjust tell Raymond
Weber that he dropped the beat, did you?

33:03.399 --> 33:05.515
— Yeah, I did now.
— Got to be careful, dawg.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.063
Yo, Ray, when was the last fucking time
you dropped the beat?

33:08.195 --> 33:09.355
Me? '83.

33:09.488 --> 33:13.072
Second week of the jazz festival.
Sheet music flew off the stand, man.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.282
l bent down to pick it up,
missed my snare drum, brah.

33:15.411 --> 33:17.072
Got to be more careful.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.240
(Richard) Man, even when it's right,
it sounds wrong.

33:19.373 --> 33:20.704
We need a guitar to fill up the hole.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.448
I don't know where to find
no guitar player, man.

33:22.585 --> 33:24.325
I know horn men and rhythm and all.

33:24.461 --> 33:26.122
But guitars? Shit.

33:26.255 --> 33:27.995
Charlie and Detroit, they got gigs.

33:28.132 --> 33:31.090
And the rest are just white boys
with bad hair playing them cowboy keys.

33:31.218 --> 33:33.300
— (Laughter)
— All right, listen, man,

33:33.429 --> 33:35.169
let's just pick it up where we left off. Come on.

33:35.306 --> 33:36.341
One, two, three...

33:38.017 --> 33:40.099
J‘ Think about the good things now

33:40.728 --> 33:43.595
J‘ Think about the bad things now

33:43.731 --> 33:46.438
J‘ Think about the right things

33:46.567 --> 33:48.148
J‘ Think about the wrong things... J‘

33:50.529 --> 33:52.815
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

33:52.948 --> 33:54.404
Somebody's still not with it.

33:55.534 --> 33:58.276
— You, man.
— (Laughter)

33:58.412 --> 34:00.243
You're right. Grayson's got no love for you.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.987
- I'm shocked.
- (Police radio chatter)

34:02.124 --> 34:06.458
But regardless, he's got no memory
of reports or casings or paper plates.

34:07.421 --> 34:10.208
And I checked with Homicide.
Nothing made it to them either.

34:10.341 --> 34:13.925
So Malatesta and the 5D cop are crazy
or lying? Those are my choices?

34:14.053 --> 34:16.544
I don't know what to tell you,
but I took this as far as I'm gonna.

34:16.680 --> 34:19.342
Terry, I'm not looking for a fight here,
just a couple of answers.

34:19.475 --> 34:22.717
I've done what I can. I gotta run —
a shooting call for my district.

34:22.853 --> 34:26.016
(On radio) ..he was shot in the left leg
and in the hand.

34:28.901 --> 34:31.062
Mr. Williams, would you
please come with me?

34:31.195 --> 34:32.935
I need you to sign your
wife's discharge papers.

34:33.072 --> 34:34.653
Can you bring them in here for me to sign?

34:34.782 --> 34:36.738
I'll stay with Mrs. Williams.

34:36.867 --> 34:38.732
I'll be OK, honey.

34:38.869 --> 34:41.986
The quicker you check her out,
the quicker she can get home.

34:42.122 --> 34:44.909
Please, I gotta get out of here.

34:46.168 --> 34:47.669
Yeah.

34:50.339 --> 34:52.671
(Coughing)

34:54.134 --> 34:57.001
OK.

34:57.137 --> 35:01.301
These are to prevent any possible
sexually transmitted diseases.

35:07.898 --> 35:09.889
Some water.

35:13.404 --> 35:15.736
OK, here's another one.

35:15.864 --> 35:17.855
OK.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.125
All right.

35:27.251 --> 35:31.494
And these are specifically
to reduce the chance of HIV.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.849
Here you go.

35:47.563 --> 35:49.178
Once more.

35:51.150 --> 35:52.560
OK.

35:52.693 --> 35:55.184
We refer to this as plan B.

35:55.321 --> 35:59.655
These pills contain hormones
which will prevent any possible pregnancy.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.274
It's your choice
if you want to take them or not.

36:02.411 --> 36:04.072
You take one now

36:04.204 --> 36:06.331
and we give you another
to take 12 hours later.

36:06.457 --> 36:07.742
(Door opens)

36:08.792 --> 36:12.159
Ms. Williams, is it OK if we talk now?

36:13.130 --> 36:15.246
Thank you.

36:15.382 --> 36:17.464
I didn't want my husband...

36:17.593 --> 36:19.299
I understand, but the sooner we can talk,

36:19.428 --> 36:21.384
the better chance we have
of making an arrest.

36:24.975 --> 36:26.886
Can you describe who attacked you?

36:31.815 --> 36:33.851
Take your time.

36:35.944 --> 36:38.321
(Music playing)

36:39.073 --> 36:41.155
(Nelson) So we flip this
motorboat over

36:41.283 --> 36:42.989
and we're in the water.

36:43.118 --> 36:45.985
And my dad sees his boss
on the dock yelling,

36:46.121 --> 36:48.282
"You crazy fucking wetbacks! "

36:49.666 --> 36:53.033
My dad just smiles.
And he says to us later,

36:53.170 --> 36:57.584
"You can either own the boat
or end up cleaning it. It's up to you."

37:00.260 --> 37:03.002
— Hey!
- Hey.

37:05.224 --> 37:07.966
So now you got a plan for me?

37:13.065 --> 37:15.306
For being first to make your number.

37:15.442 --> 37:18.024
I appreciate personal initiative.

37:18.153 --> 37:20.895
How would you like to be the new
associate vice president

37:21.031 --> 37:22.817
for demolition
and debris removal

37:22.950 --> 37:25.441
for Hidalgo & Hidalgo Limited
of Dallas, Texas?

37:25.577 --> 37:27.784
- What?
— You'll handle all my demo contracts

37:27.913 --> 37:30.780
from here on out — divvy up the work,
take whatever you can get to

37:30.916 --> 37:32.998
and give the rest to whoever can get
the job done.

37:33.127 --> 37:35.618
And, oh, you handle
all the paperwork back to P&J in Florida

37:35.754 --> 37:37.790
because I don't want to be
bothered with details.

37:39.425 --> 37:41.290
And for this | get what?

37:41.427 --> 37:43.964
5% on all of it.

37:44.096 --> 37:47.384
So if I get, say, a quarter million
in work orders,

37:47.516 --> 37:49.882
you take $12,500 off.

37:50.018 --> 37:53.010
Not to mention however much
of the actual contract you want to cover.

37:55.482 --> 37:58.940
— What stays with you?
- Me? 50%.

38:00.779 --> 38:04.271
No shame in my game.
I'm the man making it rain, right?

38:13.250 --> 38:15.161
No drink for you?

38:15.294 --> 38:17.501
She's way better company.

38:23.010 --> 38:25.251
J‘ On the sidewalk

38:25.387 --> 38:28.129
J‘ Sunday morning

38:28.265 --> 38:30.176
J‘ Lies a body

38:30.726 --> 38:32.512
J‘ Oozing life... J‘

38:34.021 --> 38:36.137
So you know what he tells
the poissonier?

38:36.273 --> 38:38.559
"Listen to your fish."

38:38.692 --> 38:40.557
Listen to the fish?

38:40.694 --> 38:42.195
(Laughs)

38:42.321 --> 38:44.186
"Listen to your fish."

38:44.323 --> 38:46.439
(Laughs)

38:46.575 --> 38:48.941
So are you doing all right with Susan?

38:49.077 --> 38:51.534
Yeah, I'm... I'm good.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.200
Good.

38:54.333 --> 38:58.201
Um... You can have the bedroom.
I'm fine out here.

38:58.337 --> 39:00.669
No, Jacques, you've done enough.

39:01.423 --> 39:02.333
Janette...

39:02.466 --> 39:06.505
No, I'm good on the sofa.
I'll be out early in the morning anyway.

39:12.935 --> 39:14.721
My favorite.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.434
(Car horns honking)

39:18.065 --> 39:20.226
(Lively jazz)

40:08.073 --> 40:10.234
(Scattered applause)

40:12.494 --> 40:15.201
Thank you. That was the title track
to the new recording Walk—up,

40:15.330 --> 40:17.195
— Jon Batiste on the piano.
- (No applause)

40:17.332 --> 40:19.288
Tony Jarvis on the sax.

40:20.210 --> 40:24.078
We'll be right back with another set.
Y'all don't go nowhere now.

40:24.214 --> 40:26.170
Keep on swinging, Delmond.

40:31.013 --> 40:32.628
It's a rough one tonight, Jack.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.629
Half—empty is half—full, dig?

40:34.766 --> 40:37.348
It's gonna be one big old obituary —

40:37.477 --> 40:40.844
"Jazz died at 115 years or whatever it is.

40:40.981 --> 40:43.063
"Cause of death:
nobody gave a shit anymore."

40:43.191 --> 40:45.933
Easy, brah. I bet we'll pack the place
tomorrow night.

40:46.069 --> 40:48.651
Saw your reviews though.
You're like the wine at Cana —

40:48.780 --> 40:51.362
everybody asking Jesus
why he saved the best for last.

40:51.491 --> 40:54.449
It's the best thing I recorded, man.
Shitjust ain't moving, though.

40:54.578 --> 40:56.694
The old ways just don't
work anymore, do they?

40:56.830 --> 40:59.913
— What do you mean?
— Well, if I want to fill this room,

41:00.042 --> 41:02.408
you got music you're trying to move,
it's a brave new world.

41:02.544 --> 41:06.878
We're getting enough hits on the website.
I'm not sure the club listings even matter.

41:07.007 --> 41:09.339
— What's your site seeing?
— My site?

41:09.468 --> 41:11.424
You got a webpage, right?

41:11.553 --> 41:13.214
Facebook page?

41:14.806 --> 41:16.671
Myspace?

41:17.434 --> 41:19.925
Del, who in fuck is your manager?

41:21.063 --> 41:22.519
It's the whole internet thing.

41:22.648 --> 41:25.560
You got a kid in Shmenge, ldaho,
sees you on Facebook,

41:25.692 --> 41:27.978
he's iTuning you ten seconds later —
kerching!

41:28.779 --> 41:32.772
Your people need to be seeding this stuff.
Won't grow othenNise.

41:41.792 --> 41:44.249
(Distant train horn blaring)

41:50.092 --> 41:51.798
You done for the night?

41:58.850 --> 42:01.262
You ain't throw a stitch
in five minutes there.

42:03.772 --> 42:05.637
lt's December, Chief.

42:05.774 --> 42:07.935
Less than three months.

42:08.068 --> 42:11.026
(Honoree crying)

42:16.993 --> 42:18.369
Oh hell, yeah.

42:18.495 --> 42:20.907
You're gonna get a job today, Antoine.
I ain't playing.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.787
(Woman) May | help you?

42:26.920 --> 42:28.535
New Orleans east.

42:28.672 --> 42:30.663
(People chattering)

42:39.516 --> 42:41.723
(Man) 173.

42:49.693 --> 42:51.524
Excuse me.

42:52.279 --> 42:54.019
Thank you.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.532
God damn.

42:59.661 --> 43:01.868
I'm not gonna make my flight.

43:01.997 --> 43:05.330
Look, that's all the receipts we could find —
the gas and the electric.

43:05.459 --> 43:08.201
We were told two documents with
the address would be enough proof.

43:08.336 --> 43:11.043
I'm sorry. I know it's a lot of papenNork,
but it's required.

43:11.173 --> 43:13.164
Come on, let's go.

43:16.970 --> 43:20.713
— Down the rabbit hole.
— Mm—hm.

43:22.768 --> 43:25.475
— Joey was shot?
- Mm.

43:25.604 --> 43:28.641
— In a store?
- Mm-hm.

43:28.774 --> 43:30.264
Who do they think did it?

43:30.400 --> 43:34.643
They don't know. There's some question
as to whether evidence was recovered

43:34.780 --> 43:38.113
or whether reports on this exist at all.

43:38.241 --> 43:42.575
See, the police work
after the storm was...

43:42.704 --> 43:44.660
what it was.

43:45.499 --> 43:46.864
So what now?

43:47.000 --> 43:50.333
l'm... I can't stay any longer
than I already have.

43:50.462 --> 43:52.327
I'm out of comp days.

43:52.464 --> 43:54.580
You should go home, Mr. Abreu.

43:55.634 --> 43:58.250
l'll learn what I can and call you.

44:01.014 --> 44:03.972
— Remind me again.
— The racetrack, Thanksgiving.

44:04.100 --> 44:05.636
Seventh race, Provocative Touch.

44:05.769 --> 44:07.384
You told me to wheel her for the exacta.

44:07.521 --> 44:10.137
That's right, yeah.
From Dallas, right?

44:10.273 --> 44:13.265
Right. I said I would stop past
when I got a moment.

44:13.401 --> 44:15.858
- Here I am.
— Consultant, huh?

44:15.987 --> 44:17.773
Around here "consultant" ain't nothing

44:17.906 --> 44:19.988
but another word for
unindicted co—conspirator.

44:20.116 --> 44:22.528
(Laughs) Well, look, like I was saying,

44:22.661 --> 44:24.743
Waco, San Antone, Dallas —

44:24.871 --> 44:26.862
my firm's done work all over Texas.

44:26.998 --> 44:28.829
Upgrading infrastructure's
what we know.

44:28.959 --> 44:31.917
And let me tell you, even without the storm
this town needs an upgrade or two.

44:32.045 --> 44:36.630
(Chuckles) Mr. Hidalgo, we appreciate
all the help that comes from out of state.

44:36.758 --> 44:40.592
But to quote the standing wisdom,
all politics is local.

44:40.720 --> 44:43.006
- Meaning?
— Who in this town are you working with?

44:43.139 --> 44:45.221
Who sent you?

44:46.184 --> 44:48.391
I'm no carpetbagger, councilman.

44:48.520 --> 44:50.886
I'm just a good—vote Democrat
here to do some good.

44:51.022 --> 44:53.229
Don't take this personally,
but over the past year

44:53.358 --> 44:55.269
we've been inundated with people
from elsewhere making money

44:55.402 --> 44:56.892
that's supposed to go to our recovery.

44:57.028 --> 44:58.859
So I'm gonna ask you again.

44:58.989 --> 45:00.729
Who in this town are you working with?

45:02.826 --> 45:04.691
CJ Liguori is a friend.

45:04.828 --> 45:07.695
(Laughs) Not exactly
a good—vote Democrat.

45:07.831 --> 45:10.618
Well, I'm comfortable
on either side of that aisle.

45:10.750 --> 45:12.286
— I'm sure.
— And the long view

45:12.419 --> 45:14.159
has you running for mayor in three years,

45:14.296 --> 45:16.662
especially with all the buyer's remorse
over Nagin.

45:16.798 --> 45:18.083
I like the long view.

45:18.216 --> 45:21.049
Right now I'm just taking it
from one day to the next.

45:21.177 --> 45:24.385
I lost my house.
I lost my brother recently.

45:24.514 --> 45:26.254
I'm just living in the here and now.

45:26.391 --> 45:30.600
Well, if tomorrow comes,
remember me, Councilman,

45:30.729 --> 45:33.141
cos I brought Texas rain for Karen Carter's
campaign last month.

45:33.273 --> 45:34.809
I'll bring that same rain for you.

45:34.941 --> 45:36.727
Couldn't help Karen in that race.

45:43.491 --> 45:45.743
Councilman Thomas, your messages.

45:45.869 --> 45:49.737
Councilman Filco,
Chief Riley, Toni Bernette.

45:49.873 --> 45:52.831
Her daughter's showing up today
for that afterschool internship.

45:55.795 --> 45:58.002
— Sorry about your brother.
- Thank you.

46:00.508 --> 46:03.545
(Helicopter blades whirring)

46:08.767 --> 46:10.553
You don't need to walk me in.

46:10.685 --> 46:13.062
Mom's the boss. I do as I'm told.

46:13.188 --> 46:15.179
Whatever.

46:16.441 --> 46:17.806
What's going on?

46:17.943 --> 46:19.979
— It's a press conference.
— Oh, OK.

46:20.111 --> 46:22.318
The Mayor's naming a new recovery czar.

46:22.447 --> 46:25.905
Recovery czar?
Last of the Romanovs.

46:32.707 --> 46:35.323
— (People chattering)
— (Man) What the fuck is goin' on?!

46:35.460 --> 46:38.247
The first floor
of my house went under.

46:38.380 --> 46:40.416
You? Much damage?

46:43.218 --> 46:45.334
I moved to New York.

46:45.470 --> 46:47.131
The city, not the state.

46:47.263 --> 46:49.254
(Woman) 197.

46:49.391 --> 46:51.677
But I got a call telling me my house
got robbed.

46:51.810 --> 46:53.766
They took everything worth taking.

46:57.107 --> 47:02.568
l'm scheduled for a hearing on January 3rd,
but I can't make that date.

47:02.696 --> 47:06.939
I already had to beg my boss
for the time to check on my house.

47:09.077 --> 47:11.864
So you're here today
without a scheduled appointment?

47:15.375 --> 47:20.085
(Sighs) Mm—mm—mm.

47:20.213 --> 47:22.670
(School bell ringing)

47:22.799 --> 47:24.915
(Children shouting)

47:52.537 --> 47:54.323
It's a Tacoma 9 series.

47:55.081 --> 47:57.242
A scratch on the back, broke tuning peg.

47:57.375 --> 48:00.617
So anyone comes in looking to sell,
he stole it, all right?

48:00.754 --> 48:02.244
All right, brah.

48:16.770 --> 48:18.385
(Woman) ..and never paid rent.

48:18.521 --> 48:19.852
How could it not be my house?

48:19.981 --> 48:21.721
I got your notification in the mail

48:21.858 --> 48:24.395
and I did call and get an appointment
for early January,

48:24.527 --> 48:26.859
but I'm down here now because my house
was broken into.

48:26.988 --> 48:29.855
I can only deal with people
who were scheduled for today.

48:29.991 --> 48:31.606
It all seems to be in order.

48:31.743 --> 48:32.823
Really?

48:32.952 --> 48:34.613
Yes, sir. You're set.

48:34.746 --> 48:36.202
I'm working in New York right now. I can't...

48:36.331 --> 48:38.822
There's nothing I can do.
Appointments are scheduled so that people...

48:38.958 --> 48:41.040
But I'm here now. I'm not gonna be able
to be here next month.

48:41.169 --> 48:42.955
It was hell coming down here just the once.

48:43.088 --> 48:44.999
— State Farm, huh?
— Mm.

48:45.131 --> 48:47.463
Screwed me too.

48:47.592 --> 48:50.584
— You're not here at your appointed day.
- I know.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.711
Could you cut me a break, please?

48:52.847 --> 48:55.304
If I cut you one, l have
to out everyone else one too.

48:55.433 --> 48:56.673
And then where will we be?

48:56.810 --> 48:59.677
I don't know.
We'd all get a break, then.

48:59.813 --> 49:01.895
Wouldn't that be a nightmare, huh?

49:03.817 --> 49:08.607
OK, you're good to go for your photo ID
and fingerprinting, for real.

49:08.738 --> 49:10.603
Thank you, ma'am.

49:10.740 --> 49:12.776
(Sax and drums playing)

49:18.915 --> 49:21.031
Say, man, you know,
Woodrow looking for you.

49:21.167 --> 49:23.909
Talking about how you run
his cell phone to death.

49:24.045 --> 49:26.036
Sure as hell did.

49:27.674 --> 49:29.539
Thanks, brah.

49:30.593 --> 49:33.926
There's a kid in Idaho needs him some
Delmond Lambreaux, huh?

49:34.055 --> 49:36.216
Yeah, maybe.

49:36.349 --> 49:38.590
You aren't gonna tell me
that you expect the label

49:38.726 --> 49:42.685
to do co—op advertising in The Boise Bugle
or whatever it's called?

49:42.814 --> 49:44.725
— Facebook.
— Facebook?

49:44.858 --> 49:47.440
Yeah, Myspace, the blogosphere, MetaFilter.

49:48.653 --> 49:50.393
Meta—who?

49:50.530 --> 49:55.240
Delmond, come on. You put out
a modern jazz recording, a good one.

49:55.368 --> 49:58.485
But the stuff sells what it sells.

49:59.205 --> 50:01.742
You know what? You're fired.

50:01.875 --> 50:03.536
l'm fired?

50:03.668 --> 50:06.535
Because I can't find a couple hundred
thousand discerning Americans

50:06.671 --> 50:09.754
to shell out for a jazz quintet's latest, l'm fired?

50:09.883 --> 50:12.374
Come... Is that what you're saying, Delmond?

50:12.510 --> 50:14.501
I'm saying go fuck yourself.

50:17.724 --> 50:20.887
J‘ Well, we had a love

50:21.019 --> 50:23.761
J‘ That was in between

50:24.314 --> 50:28.182
J‘ And to me it was like a dream

50:28.610 --> 50:32.944
J‘ If we'd stayed together till June

50:33.489 --> 50:35.946
J‘ Baby, bride and groom

50:36.075 --> 50:42.412
J‘ That's why I
got to get you off of my mind

50:42.540 --> 50:46.874
J‘ I know it's just a matter of time

50:47.003 --> 50:51.087
J‘ You found somebody new

50:51.216 --> 50:54.003
J‘ And our romance is through...

50:54.636 --> 50:56.046
Play it, baby.

50:56.179 --> 50:57.589
Yeah!

51:05.230 --> 51:07.221
Ow!

51:07.357 --> 51:09.348
All right!

51:28.044 --> 51:30.285
J‘ Yeah, yeah

51:30.421 --> 51:33.879
J‘ Yeah

51:34.008 --> 51:35.964
J‘ Got to get you

51:36.094 --> 51:38.756
J‘ Off of my mind

51:38.888 --> 51:42.346
J‘ I know it's just a matter of time

51:43.559 --> 51:47.177
J‘ You found somebody new

51:47.313 --> 51:50.350
J‘ And our romance is through

51:50.483 --> 51:52.519
J‘ That's why I

51:52.652 --> 51:57.316
J‘ Got to get you off of my mind

51:57.448 --> 52:00.906
J‘ I know it's just a matter of time J‘

52:01.661 --> 52:02.696
Oh!

52:11.337 --> 52:13.248
Yeah! Yeah!

52:13.381 --> 52:14.837
Whoo—hoo!

52:14.966 --> 52:18.049
Lord have mercy,
we finally got one down, huh?

52:18.177 --> 52:19.132
— Yeah!
- Yeah.

52:19.262 --> 52:21.127
Now all we need is eight
or nine more, baby,

52:21.264 --> 52:23.129
— and you've got you a set.
— There you go, baby.

52:23.266 --> 52:25.598
At that rate we'll be
in the clubs by summer.

52:25.727 --> 52:27.718
- (Laughter)
— (Antoine) You see, I'm tired of y'all

52:27.854 --> 52:29.719
complaining for real. Come on now.

52:29.856 --> 52:31.721
That's your job.
You're the bandleader.

52:31.858 --> 52:33.974
You know something?
I've paid for this room until 6:00.

52:34.110 --> 52:36.146
And l was gonna say let's move on
to that Joe Tex thing,

52:36.279 --> 52:39.316
but now I'm gonna say fuck all of y'all.
I'm gonna go get me a drink or two now.

52:39.449 --> 52:40.939
(Laughter)

52:41.075 --> 52:43.111
— You're bad. You're bad.
— (Wanda) I heard that.

52:48.916 --> 52:51.202
(Music playing, muffled)

53:19.572 --> 53:22.564
(Reporter) Edward Blakely,
a college professor in Australia

53:22.700 --> 53:25.237
and a go—to man for cities during disasters.

53:25.370 --> 53:27.952
He helped New York after September 11,

53:28.081 --> 53:32.541
San Francisco after the '89 earthquake,
and now New Orleans.

53:32.668 --> 53:35.956
That, I think, is not a question
that anyone can answer.

53:36.089 --> 53:37.795
What are you gonna be doing next year?

53:37.924 --> 53:39.585
Can you believe this guy?

53:39.717 --> 53:43.005
I'm not answering questions
unless they're really questions.

53:43.137 --> 53:46.220
That sounds like a threat.
The best way is my experience.

53:46.349 --> 53:49.091
(Reporter) And which ways will that translate
to making our lives better?

53:49.227 --> 53:51.058
Come back next year.

53:51.187 --> 53:52.973
The guy's a carpetbagger.

53:53.106 --> 53:55.188
All politics is local. You know that?

53:55.316 --> 53:57.056
It's true.

53:57.902 --> 54:00.143
And what are you having,
sweetheart?

54:01.781 --> 54:03.772
— (Man) J‘ Tipitina
— (Guitars playing)

54:03.908 --> 54:05.773
J‘ Tra—la—la

54:05.910 --> 54:07.775
J‘ Tra—la—la la

54:07.912 --> 54:10.153
J‘ Tra—la—la

54:10.289 --> 54:13.497
J‘ Tipitina oola malla walla dalla

54:13.626 --> 54:16.117
J‘ Tra ma ti na—na

54:18.381 --> 54:20.167
J‘ Hey

54:35.398 --> 54:37.013
J‘ Come on, baby

54:37.650 --> 54:39.481
J‘ We'll go ballin'

54:39.610 --> 54:43.478
J‘ We're gonna have ourselves a time

54:43.614 --> 54:47.152
J‘ We're gonna oola malla
walla tralla dalla

54:47.285 --> 54:49.867
J‘ Drink some mellow wine J‘

54:52.290 --> 54:54.326
Fess made it sound easier than that,

54:54.459 --> 54:56.871
— but he had a piano.
— (Laughter)

54:59.088 --> 55:00.874
'Sup, brah?

55:02.550 --> 55:05.257
I need a guitar, electric,

55:05.386 --> 55:08.093
and an amp, 30 watts at least.

55:10.641 --> 55:12.347
Man, it ain't that.

55:12.477 --> 55:14.342
Cops kicked in the door
on my roommates

55:14.479 --> 55:16.435
and left the door open behind them.

55:16.564 --> 55:19.146
So whatever didn't get broke
got stolen.

55:19.275 --> 55:22.563
Look, audition.

55:22.695 --> 55:24.526
R&B thing.

55:24.655 --> 55:27.237
I need to make this happen.

55:27.366 --> 55:29.402
And you ain't gonna pawn
my shit, right?

55:29.535 --> 55:31.821
Harley, I fucking swear on my life.

55:35.249 --> 55:37.956
How about your Telecaster?

55:38.085 --> 55:41.327
The Danelectro. Take it or leave it.

55:46.594 --> 55:48.050
This here's The Hometown Blues

55:48.179 --> 55:50.966
with apologies to Thomas Wolfe
and Doc Watson.

55:52.141 --> 55:55.679
J‘ | wish I'd never come back home... J‘

56:05.655 --> 56:09.944
The doc says you can take Vicodins
as often as you need.

56:12.703 --> 56:14.659
All right.

56:14.789 --> 56:16.404
I didn't know where you were.

56:16.541 --> 56:18.532
I call the bar, no answer.

56:18.668 --> 56:20.533
I call your mother's, no answer.

56:20.670 --> 56:22.501
I call the cops, no help.

56:22.630 --> 56:26.214
I'm doing 100 on the HO down here.
I'm scared to death.

56:31.097 --> 56:34.305
You want another pillow or something?

56:35.977 --> 56:38.389
I'm just so damn glad that you're OK.

56:41.774 --> 56:43.639
You know, that Vicodin —

56:43.776 --> 56:46.233
I can write as many refills as you want.

56:47.446 --> 56:49.402
A pillow would be good.
