<b>Tell the boss...</b>

00:07.860 --> 00:11.650
<b>I won't go back until I settle up</b>

00:11.650 --> 00:13.540
<b>with that chain user.</b>

01:34.990 --> 01:40.030
<b>Chasing x And x Waiting</b>

01:43.020 --> 01:45.290
<b>Hisoka, who joined the Phantom Troupe</b>

01:45.290 --> 01:48.040
<b>for a chance to fight the leader, Chrollo,</b>

01:48.710 --> 01:51.040
<b>has proposed that Kurapika, 
who seeks revenge</b>

01:51.040 --> 01:53.260
<b>on the Troupe, join forces with him.</b>

01:55.220 --> 01:58.540
<b>Well? It's your call.</b>

01:59.330 --> 02:00.800
<b>Will you work with me?</b>

02:01.300 --> 02:03.150
<b>Or will you fight alone?</b>

02:11.910 --> 02:13.270
<b>Go ahead.</b>

02:16.250 --> 02:17.300
<b>It's me.</b>

02:17.300 --> 02:18.830
<b>Kurapika, it's terrible...</b>

02:18.830 --> 02:21.080
<b>The man we captured has escaped.</b>

02:21.080 --> 02:23.200
<b>Escaped? On his own?</b>

02:23.660 --> 02:24.520
<b>No,</b>

02:24.520 --> 02:25.920
<b>some Troupe members</b>

02:25.920 --> 02:29.010
<b>disguised themselves as 
Mafia and came for him.</b>

02:30.020 --> 02:31.020
<b>What about the leader?</b>

02:31.020 --> 02:34.210
<b>We've been unable to reach him.</b>

02:35.350 --> 02:37.700
<b>We're heading toward pattern B.</b>

02:37.700 --> 02:39.290
<b>Return immediately.</b>

02:39.590 --> 02:40.610
<b>I understand.</b>

02:44.370 --> 02:47.100
<b>Hisoka, I have a question for you.</b>

02:47.860 --> 02:50.180
<b>Do you know what became 
of the Scarlet Eyes?</b>

02:50.180 --> 02:53.610
<b>Unfortunately, that was 
from before I joined.</b>

02:54.180 --> 02:58.180
<b>The boss sells every item after 
admiring it for a while.</b>

02:58.760 --> 03:01.280
<b>The Scarlet Eyes should be no exception.</b>

03:01.820 --> 03:03.720
<b>That is all I know.</b>

03:05.270 --> 03:07.200
<b>But keep this in mind.</b>

03:07.660 --> 03:11.870
<b>A spider will not stop moving 
until you crush its head.</b>

03:12.950 --> 03:14.780
<b>I asked if you wanted to team up,</b>

03:14.780 --> 03:16.980
<b>but I was not suggesting that 
we fight side by side.</b>

03:17.490 --> 03:21.070
<b>Merely that we exchange information, 
in a give-and-take relationship.</b>

03:22.010 --> 03:24.610
<b>If it ceases to be beneficial to either party,</b>

03:24.610 --> 03:27.820
<b>there will be no further 
obligation to cooperate.</b>

03:27.820 --> 03:29.300
<b>Simple enough, yes?</b>

03:32.350 --> 03:33.920
<b>What do you say?</b>

03:34.540 --> 03:37.020
<b>I'll be here tomorrow, 
at the same time.</b>

03:45.780 --> 03:48.160
<b>So, what do we do now?</b>

03:48.430 --> 03:50.560
<b>The leader is probably dead.</b>

03:51.010 --> 03:53.420
<b>And we haven't completed the mission...</b>

03:53.880 --> 03:56.540
<b>Shouldn't we report this to the boss?</b>

03:56.960 --> 04:00.020
<b>That little girl's our boss in name alone.</b>

04:00.020 --> 04:02.370
<b>It was someone else who hired us.</b>

04:03.320 --> 04:06.550
<b>Light Nostrade, her father.</b>

04:06.960 --> 04:09.140
<b>He gave the orders,</b>

04:09.140 --> 04:11.560
<b>and the leader received them.</b>

04:12.140 --> 04:15.150
<b>But the leader was the only one 
who knew how to contact him.</b>

04:16.970 --> 04:20.570
<b>It seems we have no choice but to report 
what's happened to the boss.</b>

04:23.060 --> 04:25.090
<b>Boss... Boss.</b>

04:31.610 --> 04:33.340
<b>What time is it?</b>

04:33.340 --> 04:35.090
<b>It's 2 AM.</b>

04:35.090 --> 04:37.940
<b>Huh? What about the auction?!</b>

04:37.940 --> 04:39.470
<b>It's been called off.</b>

04:39.470 --> 04:40.470
<b>Huh?</b>

04:40.470 --> 04:42.590
<b>Called off? Why?</b>

04:42.980 --> 04:45.840
<b>The auction was attacked by thieves.</b>

04:46.220 --> 04:46.860
<b>Huh?</b>

04:46.860 --> 04:51.500
<b>Baise, Ivlenkov, and Tocino 
died during the attack.</b>

04:51.900 --> 04:53.080
<b>What?</b>

04:53.080 --> 04:56.540
<b>We can't reach the leader, 
so he's probably done for.</b>

04:56.540 --> 04:57.630
<b>No way.</b>

04:58.110 --> 04:59.730
<b>What about the mummy?</b>

05:00.650 --> 05:02.600
<b>Was it really stolen?</b>

05:02.600 --> 05:04.430
<b>I wanted it so much...</b>

05:06.020 --> 05:09.120
<b>The Mafia community moved the 
merchandise to a safe location.</b>

05:09.750 --> 05:11.960
<b>Oh, that's great!</b>

05:11.960 --> 05:14.200
<b>So when is the next auction?</b>

05:14.200 --> 05:15.470
<b>We don't yet know.</b>

05:15.470 --> 05:17.120
<b>What? Why not?</b>

05:17.500 --> 05:21.620
<b>In any event, the leader 
handled all communication,</b>

05:21.620 --> 05:23.390
<b>so we don't know anything.</b>

05:23.800 --> 05:26.990
<b>We cannot act until we have orders.</b>

05:26.990 --> 05:29.640
<b>I don't know anything about that.</b>

05:30.170 --> 05:32.830
<b>So, ask Daddy.</b>

05:32.830 --> 05:35.100
<b>His number's on my phone.</b>

05:36.350 --> 05:38.270
<b>Squala, make the call.</b>

05:38.270 --> 05:40.110
<b>Huh? Why me?!</b>

05:40.440 --> 05:43.270
<b>You're the most experienced member left.</b>

05:43.270 --> 05:44.170
<b>You should be the leader.</b>

05:44.170 --> 05:44.990
<b>No way!</b>

05:44.990 --> 05:45.990
<b>Out of the question!</b>

05:45.990 --> 05:49.090
<b>I'm not the leader type.</b>

05:49.090 --> 05:52.250
<b>Perhaps we should take a vote, to be fair?</b>

05:52.630 --> 05:55.370
<b>We need to make the call quickly.</b>

05:56.200 --> 05:58.500
<b>I vote for Kurapika.</b>

05:59.130 --> 06:01.370
<b>He was the one who 
apprehended the bandit,</b>

06:01.370 --> 06:03.580
<b>and he has shown excellent judgment.</b>

06:04.080 --> 06:07.010
<b>I believe he would make the best leader.</b>

06:07.300 --> 06:10.290
<b>No objections here. 
I vote for Kurapika.</b>

06:12.180 --> 06:13.540
<b>That's that...</b>

06:13.540 --> 06:14.980
<b>You make the call.</b>

06:17.250 --> 06:18.340
<b>I understand.</b>

06:19.020 --> 06:22.620
<b>As the interim leader, 
I'll call Mr. Nostrade.</b>

06:22.620 --> 06:26.990
<b>This is only until we confirm 
what's become of Dalzollene.</b>

06:27.790 --> 06:30.840
<b>Any final decision will be 
Mr. Nostrade's to make.</b>

06:33.270 --> 06:36.010
<b><i>I never expected to get 
a chance so soon...</i></b>

06:38.600 --> 06:41.180
<b>It would be inappropriate for 
me to call him directly,</b>

06:41.180 --> 06:43.470
<b>so would you provide an 
introduction, boss?</b>

06:43.970 --> 06:45.020
<b>Sure.</b>

06:50.530 --> 06:52.900
<b>Then, I'm putting him on now.</b>

06:53.720 --> 06:54.700
<b>Hello?</b>

06:55.420 --> 06:58.560
<b>Is it true that Dalzollene has been killed?</b>

06:58.560 --> 06:59.630
<b>Yes.</b>

07:00.100 --> 07:01.720
<b>I find that hard to believe.</b>

07:01.720 --> 07:03.310
<b>He is a <i>Nen</i> user.</b>

07:04.180 --> 07:05.970
<b>He's trained to withstand</b>

07:05.970 --> 07:08.890
<b>ten gunshots without sustaining injury.</b>

07:08.890 --> 07:11.740
<b>He was killed by a group of outlaws 
known as the Phantom Troupe.</b>

07:12.980 --> 07:14.100
<b>The spiders?</b>

07:14.700 --> 07:16.610
<b>I had an opportunity to see them in action.</b>

07:16.610 --> 07:20.210
<b>One of them stopped a 
bazooka rocket with one hand.</b>

07:20.590 --> 07:23.620
<b>I am Kurapika, the interim leader.</b>

07:23.620 --> 07:26.710
<b>Could you please issue us our orders?</b>

07:27.080 --> 07:30.530
<b>First, I'd like to hear your 
opinion as interim leader.</b>

07:31.310 --> 07:32.520
<b>I believe we should</b>

07:32.520 --> 07:35.780
<b>get your daughter out of 
Yorknew City immediately.</b>

07:36.270 --> 07:38.120
<b>If anything unexpected happens,</b>

07:38.120 --> 07:40.310
<b>we would be unable to protect her.</b>

07:41.570 --> 07:45.260
<b>I agree with your assessment, 
but my daughter also has a say.</b>

07:45.630 --> 07:48.800
<b>I want to respect her wishes when possible.</b>

07:49.930 --> 07:52.240
<b>My top priority is her safety.</b>

07:54.300 --> 07:55.650
<b>I understand.</b>

07:55.650 --> 07:57.850
<b>I'm on my way now.</b>

07:57.850 --> 07:59.660
<b>I should arrive by tomorrow evening.</b>

08:00.090 --> 08:02.750
<b>I shall do my best to persuade Neon.</b>

08:03.560 --> 08:06.040
<b>You will be the new leader, Kurapika.</b>

08:07.910 --> 08:09.390
<b>Here is your first order.</b>

08:09.690 --> 08:12.720
<b>Keep an eye on Neon until I arrive.</b>

08:12.720 --> 08:13.930
<b>Understood.</b>

08:16.730 --> 08:19.790
<b>Your father will arrive tomorrow night.</b>

08:19.790 --> 08:20.840
<b>Really?</b>

08:20.840 --> 08:21.890
<b>Yay!</b>

08:21.890 --> 08:24.270
<b>I'll get him to buy me lots of clothes.</b>

08:24.630 --> 08:28.520
<b>You are to wait in your room until then.</b>

08:28.900 --> 08:30.180
<b>What?</b>

08:30.180 --> 08:31.900
<b>I want to see the casino...</b>

08:32.750 --> 08:34.130
<b>Stay here with the boss.</b>

08:34.130 --> 08:34.920
<b>Huh?</b>

08:34.920 --> 08:36.220
<b>S-Sure...</b>

08:36.750 --> 08:38.700
<b>I'll be downstairs, investigating.</b>

08:59.770 --> 09:01.310
<b>Here we go!</b>

09:01.630 --> 09:04.470
<b>That building you were in is owned by</b>

09:04.470 --> 09:06.980
<b>a dummy corporation for 
the Nostrade Family.</b>

09:07.710 --> 09:09.940
<b>Can you get a list of buildings</b>

09:09.940 --> 09:13.030
<b>the Nostrade Family owns in this area?</b>

09:13.030 --> 09:14.130
<b>Of course!</b>

09:14.570 --> 09:18.950
<b>I can also see if anyone's checked 
in using the Nostrade name.</b>

09:24.550 --> 09:27.080
<b>Here, I brought more beer.</b>

09:27.440 --> 09:29.080
<b>Oh, thanks.</b>

09:31.740 --> 09:32.850
<b>Here.</b>

09:32.850 --> 09:35.380
<b>You should get a Hunter License, Uvo.</b>

09:36.030 --> 09:38.530
<b>You can get all kinds of 
information from this website,</b>

09:38.530 --> 09:40.350
<b>as long as you have the money.</b>

09:41.130 --> 09:44.670
<b>Unlike you guys, I dislike 
the idea of money.</b>

09:44.670 --> 09:46.670
<b>If there's something I want, I take it.</b>

09:46.670 --> 09:47.810
<b>How splendid...</b>

09:47.810 --> 09:49.360
<b>You are the model thief!</b>

09:51.120 --> 09:51.860
<b>Here we go.</b>

09:52.480 --> 09:55.360
<b>They own two other buildings.</b>

09:55.860 --> 09:59.020
<b>And there are three hotels 
where members are staying...</b>

09:59.750 --> 10:03.230
<b>Well, this should be a short search.</b>

10:04.220 --> 10:05.370
<b>Thanks.</b>

10:06.040 --> 10:07.290
<b>I appreciate it.</b>

10:08.270 --> 10:10.380
<b>Wh-What was that for?!</b>

10:11.240 --> 10:13.110
<b>Well, I'm off, then.</b>

10:13.660 --> 10:15.080
<b>What about the beer?</b>

10:15.080 --> 10:16.760
<b>You guys can finish it.</b>

10:17.110 --> 10:19.260
<b>Make sure you dispose of the body.</b>

10:19.810 --> 10:21.420
<b>Try to make it quick.</b>

10:22.140 --> 10:22.760
<b>Yeah.</b>

10:23.530 --> 10:24.250
<b>Bye.</b>

10:24.250 --> 10:25.020
<b>Uvo!</b>

10:25.900 --> 10:27.020
<b>Huh?</b>

10:27.900 --> 10:29.900
<b>Don't get careless.</b>

10:31.030 --> 10:32.000
<b>Yeah.</b>

10:41.910 --> 10:43.540
<b><i>Family members?</i></b>

10:44.350 --> 10:46.190
<b><i>I'll start with them.</i></b>

10:53.370 --> 10:54.290
<b>Look at this.</b>

10:54.710 --> 10:55.740
<b>What's that?</b>

10:56.110 --> 10:59.010
<b>A list of buildings owned 
by the Nostrade Family?</b>

10:59.010 --> 11:01.210
<b>There's a list of Family members...</b>

11:01.210 --> 11:03.300
<b>I didn't know this information was available.</b>

11:03.880 --> 11:06.990
<b>This website can only be 
accessed by pro Hunters.</b>

11:07.430 --> 11:12.250
<b>With this information, 
they can locate this room.</b>

11:13.160 --> 11:15.420
<b>A website for pro Hunters...</b>

11:15.970 --> 11:19.190
<b>Then if one of the enemies is a pro Hunter...</b>

11:19.540 --> 11:20.920
<b>We're in big trouble.</b>

11:21.230 --> 11:24.200
<b>We need to take the boss 
and find a different room.</b>

11:24.200 --> 11:26.830
<b>Eh? In the same hotel?</b>

11:26.830 --> 11:29.200
<b>It's faster and avoids needless movement.</b>

11:29.660 --> 11:31.820
<b>But we cannot use fake names.</b>

11:31.820 --> 11:34.340
<b>We'll have Melody or Basho register the room.</b>

11:34.750 --> 11:38.050
<b>Make sure everyone, 
especially the boss, stays inside.</b>

11:38.050 --> 11:39.070
<b>Got it.</b>

11:39.570 --> 11:41.660
<b>Don't check out of this one.</b>

11:42.220 --> 11:44.220
<b>Kurapika? What about you?</b>

11:45.500 --> 11:46.720
<b>I'll stay here.</b>

11:46.720 --> 11:47.520
<b>Huh?</b>

11:47.940 --> 11:50.230
<b>You can't mean to...</b>

12:01.510 --> 12:04.570
<b>I-I don't think that's a Family member.</b>

12:04.570 --> 12:07.260
<b>He's a bodyguard for the boss' daughter...</b>

12:07.790 --> 12:09.080
<b>Daughter?</b>

12:09.460 --> 12:10.400
<b>Yeah...</b>

12:10.400 --> 12:13.840
<b>She's a strange one who 
collects human body parts.</b>

12:13.840 --> 12:16.070
<b>Eyeballs and organs...</b>

12:16.880 --> 12:21.220
<b>Oh, and she's an incredibly 
accurate fortune teller.</b>

12:21.220 --> 12:22.590
<b>Fortune teller?</b>

12:22.920 --> 12:25.640
<b>She has a long list of Mafia clients...</b>

12:25.640 --> 12:28.780
<b>Some community elders basically worship her.</b>

12:33.160 --> 12:35.640
<b>After all, our boss</b>

12:35.640 --> 12:39.120
<b>made his fortune by using 
his daughter's power.</b>

12:39.120 --> 12:39.780
<b>Hey...</b>

12:39.780 --> 12:41.290
<b>C-Cut me some slack?</b>

12:41.290 --> 12:42.640
<b>I told you everything I know.</b>

12:42.640 --> 12:43.480
<b>Please spare me!</b>

12:49.400 --> 12:51.370
<b><i>Someone who can see the future...</i></b>

12:52.270 --> 12:55.620
<b><i>She knew the attack would happen?</i></b>

12:56.590 --> 12:58.910
<b><i>The boss was right.</i></b>

12:58.910 --> 13:01.940
<b><i>There weren't any traitors.</i></b>

13:05.540 --> 13:08.540
<b>Currently, we have a 3,000,000 diamond</b>

13:08.540 --> 13:11.220
<b>and 2,400,000 Jenny in leftover cash.</b>

13:11.220 --> 13:15.390
<b>And we also have the 2,750,000 
Jenny from the arm wrestling.</b>

13:15.860 --> 13:19.150
<b>That gives us a total of around 8,000,000.</b>

13:19.610 --> 13:22.710
<b>We need to turn this into at least 9 billion,</b>

13:22.710 --> 13:26.420
<b>the minimum opening bid for <i>Greed Island</i>...</b>

13:27.000 --> 13:30.410
<b>I don't see how we can manage that 
through legitimate channels.</b>

13:30.690 --> 13:33.730
<b>I wouldn't call that arm wrestling legitimate.</b>

13:34.350 --> 13:38.920
<b>All the challengers toward the end were 
half desperate losers trying for revenge.</b>

13:39.380 --> 13:42.920
<b>That's fine. 
That was my goal.</b>

13:42.920 --> 13:43.890
<b>Huh?</b>

13:44.420 --> 13:47.500
<b>We want as many people as 
possible to embellish the tale.</b>

13:47.500 --> 13:48.930
<b>What do you mean?</b>

13:49.350 --> 13:51.340
<b>The arm wrestling was meant as bait.</b>

13:51.340 --> 13:52.580
<b>Bait?</b>

13:52.580 --> 13:55.430
<b>To draw out the moles.</b>

13:55.430 --> 13:58.990
<b>Moles? Why do we want moles?</b>

13:58.990 --> 14:02.330
<b>Pipe down now. 
I'll explain everything.</b>

14:05.280 --> 14:06.950
<b>Come on down!</b>

14:07.220 --> 14:09.110
<b>Let's have some 
conditional auctioning fun!</b>

14:09.110 --> 14:12.370
<b>We have a diamond worth 3,000,000.</b>

14:12.370 --> 14:14.830
<b>The winner will be determined 
through arm wrestling.</b>

14:15.240 --> 14:18.920
<b>The first person to beat this 
boy wins the diamond.</b>

14:19.590 --> 14:21.880
<b>You must pay a 10,000-Jenny entry fee.</b>

14:22.190 --> 14:24.150
<b>What? He's just a kid.</b>

14:24.150 --> 14:25.320
<b>I'll give it a shot.</b>

14:25.320 --> 14:26.640
<b>Don't bother.</b>

14:26.640 --> 14:29.760
<b>That kid beat five hundred people yesterday.</b>

14:30.010 --> 14:31.040
<b>Huh?</b>

14:31.040 --> 14:34.400
<b>Over twenty ended up with broken arms.</b>

14:34.400 --> 14:35.810
<b>Seriously?!</b>

14:38.840 --> 14:41.580
<b><i>The stories are spreading nicely.</i></b>

14:41.580 --> 14:42.880
<b><i>In that case...</i></b>

14:44.050 --> 14:45.370
<b>Move.</b>

14:46.860 --> 14:49.540
<b>Oh, do we have our first challenger?</b>

14:49.540 --> 14:50.760
<b>No.</b>

14:50.760 --> 14:51.510
<b>Huh?</b>

14:52.340 --> 14:55.040
<b>I already know that my man 
can't beat your kid.</b>

14:55.580 --> 14:57.510
<b>I was watching yesterday.</b>

14:57.510 --> 14:58.810
<b>Then what do you want?</b>

14:58.810 --> 15:00.920
<b>Interested in making some real money?</b>

15:01.250 --> 15:02.540
<b>Meaning?</b>

15:02.850 --> 15:05.410
<b>I know where you can make big bucks</b>

15:05.410 --> 15:08.550
<b>instead of the pocket change 
you're getting here.</b>

15:08.930 --> 15:10.640
<b>You can make hundreds...</b>

15:10.640 --> 15:13.100
<b>No, thousands of times more.</b>

15:21.550 --> 15:23.590
<b>Are they moles?</b>

15:23.590 --> 15:26.710
<b>Yeah, looks like we landed a big fish.</b>

15:26.710 --> 15:28.130
<b>Huh? Fish?</b>

15:28.130 --> 15:29.460
<b>Don't you mean moles?</b>

15:29.460 --> 15:32.200
<b>Stop talking. 
It doesn't matter!</b>

15:35.440 --> 15:36.580
<b>Here we are.</b>

16:01.940 --> 16:04.780
<b>Oh! I can feel the bloodlust.</b>

16:04.780 --> 16:07.730
<b>The arm wrestling competition here 
accepts all comers, and it pays out.</b>

16:08.010 --> 16:10.080
<b>The spectators bet on each match,</b>

16:10.080 --> 16:13.130
<b>and the winner receives ten 
percent of all bets placed.</b>

16:13.130 --> 16:16.000
<b>We're talking billions bet on each match.</b>

16:16.810 --> 16:19.870
<b>That would mean millions with each win!</b>

16:19.870 --> 16:21.940
<b>You could win even more...</b>

16:21.940 --> 16:25.620
<b>I'll be taking fifty percent of your 
earnings as my commission.</b>

16:25.970 --> 16:28.340
<b>Fifty percent? Isn't that a little high?</b>

16:28.340 --> 16:31.730
<b>You can't participate 
unless I enter your name.</b>

16:31.730 --> 16:33.840
<b>Besides, you can bet your own money.</b>

16:34.420 --> 16:36.670
<b>You'll get great odds with that kid,</b>

16:36.670 --> 16:38.810
<b>and earn back your stake 
a hundred times over.</b>

16:38.810 --> 16:41.060
<b>That's right! I'm in!</b>

16:41.060 --> 16:42.460
<b>Go, Gon!</b>

16:42.460 --> 16:43.480
<b>Huh?</b>

16:44.030 --> 16:46.780
<b>Well? Any other challengers?</b>

16:46.780 --> 16:48.180
<b>Got one right here!</b>

16:51.160 --> 16:53.490
<b>This kid's up for the challenge.</b>

16:54.660 --> 16:55.680
<b>Very well.</b>

17:01.290 --> 17:06.350
<b>Sorry, but the arm wrestling is canceled!</b>

17:06.350 --> 17:09.920
<b>We'll be doing some 
conditional auctioning now!</b>

17:11.270 --> 17:13.300
<b>Why was it canceled?</b>

17:13.300 --> 17:15.510
<b>U-Uh, I don't know.</b>

17:15.820 --> 17:20.010
<b>To win, you must play 
hide-and-seek!</b>

17:20.970 --> 17:22.360
<b>Hide-and-seek?</b>

17:22.360 --> 17:25.110
<b>We'll start by passing out flyers!</b>

17:27.570 --> 17:30.650
<b>Examine the pictures on the flyer.</b>

17:31.390 --> 17:36.410
<b>Those seven people are your targets!</b>

17:36.830 --> 17:39.390
<b>Hey, that girl with glasses was...</b>

17:39.870 --> 17:42.160
<b>Yep, she arm wrestled me.</b>

17:42.620 --> 17:46.900
<b>Hey, are they the ones responsible 
for what happened last night?</b>

17:46.900 --> 17:50.470
<b>Yeah, you mean the attack on the auction?</b>

17:51.890 --> 17:53.830
<b>In order to win the bid,</b>

17:53.830 --> 17:57.430
<b>you must capture and deliver a target to us.</b>

17:57.430 --> 17:59.960
<b>For each target brought in,</b>

17:59.960 --> 18:03.810
<b>you will receive a nice sum of 2 billion Jenny!</b>

18:07.180 --> 18:08.790
<b>There is no time limit.</b>

18:08.790 --> 18:11.220
<b>It doesn't matter if the 
target is dead or alive.</b>

18:11.220 --> 18:14.190
<b>Please contact us once 
you've captured one!</b>

18:14.500 --> 18:16.350
<b>Two billion each?</b>

18:16.350 --> 18:19.200
<b>If we catch them all, we'd have 14 billion!</b>

18:19.970 --> 18:24.080
<b>It'll cost you 5 million Jenny to participate!</b>

18:24.870 --> 18:26.420
<b>We're joining in, right?</b>

18:26.420 --> 18:27.400
<b>Yeah...</b>

18:35.170 --> 18:38.450
<b>Yeah, that's right. 
I'll fax you the information.</b>

18:38.450 --> 18:40.090
<b>Search the Net for information.</b>

18:40.090 --> 18:42.020
<b>We'll pay for anything concrete.</b>

18:43.630 --> 18:45.580
<b>We need to hurry.</b>

18:45.580 --> 18:47.080
<b>There's no rush.</b>

18:47.080 --> 18:48.850
<b>They won't be able to catch our targets.</b>

18:48.850 --> 18:50.130
<b>Huh?</b>

18:50.130 --> 18:52.750
<b>After all, the Mafia's having 
trouble handling them.</b>

18:53.130 --> 18:54.360
<b>What do you mean?</b>

18:54.710 --> 18:58.890
<b>This conditional auction is 
nothing but a bounty hunt.</b>

18:58.890 --> 18:59.940
<b>In other words,</b>

18:59.940 --> 19:04.490
<b>the Mafia is admitting that, alone, 
it can't capture these targets.</b>

19:04.920 --> 19:06.730
<b>You have a point...</b>

19:06.730 --> 19:11.000
<b>They were willing to suspend 
everything to track them down.</b>

19:11.490 --> 19:15.500
<b>I just heard that the underground 
 auction was attacked last night.</b>

19:15.810 --> 19:17.480
<b>The underground auction?!</b>

19:18.220 --> 19:20.260
<b>Was it them?</b>

19:20.840 --> 19:24.010
<b>That's why there's a 
reward for their heads?</b>

19:24.510 --> 19:28.720
<b>Yep, they must be nuts to 
steal from the Mafia.</b>

19:29.150 --> 19:32.520
<b>And we already know who would 
be crazy enough for that.</b>

19:35.530 --> 19:37.030
<b>The Phantom Troupe!</b>

19:42.770 --> 19:43.880
<b>Oh, right...</b>

19:43.880 --> 19:45.920
<b>What's Kurapika up to?</b>

19:45.920 --> 19:48.430
<b>Yeah, he should be in the city,</b>

19:48.430 --> 19:49.810
<b>but he hasn't made contact.</b>

19:50.370 --> 19:51.790
<b>I'll call him.</b>

20:17.110 --> 20:18.370
<b>He isn't answering.</b>

20:18.370 --> 20:19.840
<b>Is he working?</b>

20:19.840 --> 20:20.970
<b>Working?</b>

20:20.970 --> 20:24.320
<b>I heard that he's been 
working as a bodyguard.</b>

20:24.780 --> 20:27.280
<b>Probably for some VIP...</b>

20:27.280 --> 20:29.000
<b>He's trying to track down the Scarlet Eyes,</b>

20:29.000 --> 20:31.330
<b>so it must be someone in the underworld.</b>

20:31.720 --> 20:34.500
<b>What if he was guarding that 
person at the auction house,</b>

20:34.500 --> 20:36.460
<b>and got caught up in the attack?</b>

20:36.760 --> 20:39.250
<b>He wouldn't have been 
caught up in the attack.</b>

20:39.250 --> 20:43.560
<b>If the Troupe attacked, he'd be 
actively tracking them down.</b>

20:44.110 --> 20:47.470
<b>It's possible that he's already 
captured two or three.</b>

20:48.140 --> 20:49.860
<b>I hope you're right...</b>

21:13.040 --> 21:14.310
<b>Alone?</b>

21:14.890 --> 21:16.580
<b>I'm impressed.</b>

21:18.230 --> 21:19.570
<b>Where do you want to die?</b>

21:21.150 --> 21:23.620
<b>I'll humor any requests.</b>

21:25.670 --> 21:28.720
<b>I'd prefer a deserted wasteland, 
with no one nearby.</b>

21:29.600 --> 21:32.160
<b>Since I'll have you screaming 
at the top of your lungs.</b>

21:35.710 --> 21:40.510
<b>Uvogin has come to avenge his 
capture and restore his pride.</b>

21:41.390 --> 21:43.540
<b>And Kurapika has been waiting</b>

21:43.540 --> 21:46.210
<b>for the chance to exact revenge 
upon the Phantom Troupe.</b>

21:47.540 --> 21:50.500
<b>Their battle is about to start.</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:06.110
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:06.110
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

23:01.400 --> 23:02.950
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:02.950 --> 23:03.650
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.650 --> 23:05.300
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:06.620 --> 23:07.470
<b>It's Gon</b>

23:07.470 --> 23:08.320
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:08.320 --> 23:09.460
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:08.530 --> 23:19.460
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:09.460 --> 23:11.230
<b>Today, we introduce Squala.</b>

23:10.970 --> 23:12.990
<b>One of Neon's bodyguards.</b>

23:11.230 --> 23:12.570
<b>He's one of Neon's bodyguards!</b>

23:12.570 --> 23:14.410
<b>He can control dogs with <i>Nen</i>.</b>

23:12.990 --> 23:19.460
<b>A Manipulator who 
controls his pet dogs.</b>

23:14.410 --> 23:15.300
<b>He's a Manipulator.</b>

23:15.300 --> 23:18.230
<b>He's actually dating Eliza-san, Neon's maid.</b>

23:18.230 --> 23:18.840
<b>Meow!</b>

23:18.840 --> 23:19.790
<b>Woof!</b>

23:24.800 --> 23:27.420
<b>Next time: Condition x And x Condition.</b>

23:27.420 --> 23:30.420
<b>Explain the difference in thirty words.</b>

23:30.420 --> 23:31.840
<b>A condition is a rule.</b>

23:31.840 --> 23:34.260
<b>A condition is a covenant with yourself!</b>
