WEBVTT

00:02.176 --> 00:04.526
Good session, JJ.
Sorry I kept spilling on you,

00:04.569 --> 00:06.919
but I am worthless
before my soup.

00:06.963 --> 00:07.703
Kenneth:

00:07.746 --> 00:09.009
Hi, DiMeos.

00:11.011 --> 00:11.924
Hey, you.

00:16.581 --> 00:17.887
See you all
next week.

00:18.801 --> 00:20.194
Maya: Kenneth.

00:20.237 --> 00:23.284
We all had a family meeting
with our eyes a second ago,

00:23.327 --> 00:24.894
and we're all in agreement
that has to stop.

00:24.937 --> 00:28.071
What does?Saying "hey, you" like that

00:28.115 --> 00:30.204
to anyone
you've briefly dated.

00:30.247 --> 00:31.248
As a rule,
we'd like to keep

00:31.292 --> 00:33.685
the hyper-sexualized greetings
to a minimum.

00:33.729 --> 00:35.861
If I have to follow the rule,
you should, too.

00:36.906 --> 00:39.343
Okay.
I said it one time.

00:40.736 --> 00:42.085
Hey, you.

00:43.695 --> 00:44.479
Hey, you.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.048
Hey, you.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.442
I have a life.

00:51.486 --> 00:54.184
I have needs.
Call me romantic.

00:54.228 --> 00:55.229
Nobody's calling you
romantic.No one's calling you
romantic.

00:55.272 --> 00:56.404
But when I've been
with someone,

00:56.447 --> 00:58.101
it means something to me.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.668
"Hey, you"...

00:59.711 --> 01:01.191
...is my tip of the cap

01:01.235 --> 01:03.150
to a beautiful
experience.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.545
Hey, you.

01:11.549 --> 01:14.422
What? You're the only one
with a history?

01:14.465 --> 01:17.425
--Captions by VITAC--

01:19.818 --> 01:21.298
Romance!

01:21.342 --> 01:25.259
Your next film
is going to be a romance

01:25.302 --> 01:29.263
from the 12th century tale
of "Tristan and Isol--"

01:29.306 --> 01:31.395
Forget it.

01:31.439 --> 01:33.180
I got dumped,
and I need to feel good again.

01:33.223 --> 01:35.356
Sue me. What?

01:35.399 --> 01:39.273
"How strictly are you
defining romance?"

01:39.316 --> 01:41.362
You may not make a movie
about the romance

01:41.405 --> 01:42.711
between a killer
and their weapon.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.237
Your film must make me
believe in love again.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.370
Anything less
will get an "F."

01:49.413 --> 01:50.545
You have one hour.

01:50.588 --> 01:53.243
Listen to me,
I sound just like Jamie.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.245
Take your time.

01:56.377 --> 01:57.334
Take your time.

01:57.378 --> 01:59.554
Maya: Hello,
prospective investors.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.947
We are two mums of
kids with disabilities,

02:01.991 --> 02:04.341
and we are starting a business
for people like us.

02:04.385 --> 02:06.256
Here's
a fascinating statistic

02:06.300 --> 02:07.736
about the adaptive-clothing
industry.

02:07.779 --> 02:08.954
Blah, blah, blah.

02:08.998 --> 02:09.825
Shocking, right?

02:09.868 --> 02:11.957
I had no idea.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.524
But what I do know is,

02:13.568 --> 02:15.352
insert completely improvised
yet heartfelt anecdote

02:15.396 --> 02:16.266
about parenting.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.834
But why tell you about
our amazing products

02:18.877 --> 02:19.791
when we can
just show you?

02:26.494 --> 02:28.800
Whoa!
I did not see that coming.

02:28.844 --> 02:30.019
And I loved it!

02:31.412 --> 02:33.370
It worked. It worked.Amazing, right?

02:33.414 --> 02:35.981
And I remembered to wear
clothes underneath this time.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.853
Okay, let's talk
about market strategies,
competition analysis,

02:37.896 --> 02:39.463
and a design
and development plan.

02:39.507 --> 02:42.379
Oh, Melanie,
you are a godsend.No, you're the godsend.

02:42.423 --> 02:44.468
I mean, when John left,
I thought my life was over.

02:44.512 --> 02:46.383
And now I have a friend,
a dream,

02:46.427 --> 02:49.343
and no fewer than six
tear-away business suits.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.040
Not a great use
of our capital.
Hmm.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.955
Oh, shoot. I got to go get Logan
from school.

02:52.998 --> 02:54.043
Kenneth can
go and get him.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.218
Can he?

02:55.262 --> 02:57.220
I-Is Kenneth something

02:57.264 --> 02:58.178
you can lend your friends

02:58.221 --> 03:00.484
like a "Mad Men" DVD set?

03:00.528 --> 03:02.530
Did you specifically
use that as an example

03:02.573 --> 03:05.228
because you've borrowed
our "Mad Men" DVD set

03:05.272 --> 03:06.577
and have as yet
to give it back?

03:08.144 --> 03:09.145
I'll go get Logan.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.234
A romance?

03:11.278 --> 03:12.279
Where do we even start?

03:14.019 --> 03:18.415
"We could draw on
our own romantic pasts."

03:22.419 --> 03:23.725
Yeah.

03:23.768 --> 03:25.814
You know, if you're
looking for romance,

03:25.857 --> 03:27.859
you should've seen me
in the planetarium earlier.

03:27.903 --> 03:29.296
This girl, Izzy,
came in,

03:29.339 --> 03:32.429
and we had
insane chemistry.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.518
And how does this help us
with our movie?

03:34.562 --> 03:36.433
You need to cast Izzy and me
as the leads.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.000
We'll fall in love,

03:38.043 --> 03:40.263
and you'll get
the best on-screen romance

03:40.307 --> 03:42.700
since a certain Harry
met the Hendersons.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.529
Sound like a plan?

03:47.183 --> 03:48.619
Sure.

03:48.663 --> 03:49.533
I'm excited, too, guys.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.102
Whoa!

03:53.145 --> 03:54.408
All those years,

03:54.451 --> 03:56.236
we have not lost
the sound.Or the look.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.585
-Wore these in '92.

03:57.628 --> 03:59.064
I had them altered.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.283
-Yeah.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.416
Hey. We got the sound
and the look.

04:02.459 --> 04:03.330
I think we should gig.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.157
Come on.
We're grown-ups now.

04:05.201 --> 04:07.116
It'd be pathetic.
This -- This is just for us.

04:07.159 --> 04:07.899
Yeah, you're right.

04:07.943 --> 04:08.857
That was a cheap escape

04:08.900 --> 04:10.293
we needed
when we were young

04:10.337 --> 04:12.252
because we had
nothing else.

04:12.295 --> 04:15.080
We were broke,
lived in crappy houses.

04:15.124 --> 04:16.517
We hated our jobs.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.084
Yeah, remember those days?

04:19.868 --> 04:22.087
-Anyhoo, "Satisfaction."
-Yes.

04:23.132 --> 04:26.614
♪ I can't get no

04:26.657 --> 04:29.486
♪ Satisfaction

04:29.530 --> 04:30.879
♪ 'Cause I try

04:30.922 --> 04:33.273
♪ And I try

04:33.316 --> 04:35.100
♪ And I try

04:35.144 --> 04:36.450
♪ And I try Dylan: Whoa.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.886
You guys are amazing.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.235
Really?

04:39.279 --> 04:40.367
Yeah, I guess
we kind of are.

04:40.410 --> 04:43.326
Don't. Jimmy doesn't
need adoration.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.501
No, no, no, no, no.
Let her finish.

04:44.545 --> 04:45.546
What was that song?

04:45.589 --> 04:46.503
Uh, it's called
"Satisfaction."

04:46.547 --> 04:47.504
And you wrote it?

04:52.335 --> 04:53.423
Yes. Yes, I did.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.557
Jimmy, come on.

04:56.600 --> 04:57.775
Wewrote it.We wrote it.

04:58.907 --> 05:01.344
You want this one?
Yeah.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.694
Oh. You must be Izzy.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.392
You're game
to be in the movie?

05:05.435 --> 05:07.568
Actually, I have no interest
in leaving my comfort zone,

05:07.611 --> 05:08.830
and I would not like
to be in the movie.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.354
That was acting.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.315
Hey, now!

05:15.358 --> 05:16.620
Oh, is that Penn and Teller
over there?

05:16.664 --> 05:18.970
'Cause it looks like we're
about to make some magic.

05:19.014 --> 05:21.233
Oh, yeah, and, uh,
one of us doesn't talk.

05:23.758 --> 05:26.238
Can I, uh, talk to you
over here for a sec?

05:27.936 --> 05:30.242
Don't you ever
one-up me again,

05:30.286 --> 05:31.635
especially
in front of Izzy.

05:31.679 --> 05:32.810
Sorry?

05:32.854 --> 05:34.856
No, I-I'm sorry.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.336
Same team.

05:36.379 --> 05:37.772
Thank you so much
for casting me and Izzy.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.513
Yeah.

05:39.556 --> 05:40.862
Shall we begin?

05:40.905 --> 05:42.603
Yes. Uh...

05:42.646 --> 05:45.040
"Izzy, you obviously
know Ray."

05:45.083 --> 05:45.910
Who's Ray?

05:45.954 --> 05:47.042
I'm Ray.

05:47.085 --> 05:49.131
From the planetarium?

05:49.174 --> 05:51.351
You accidentally
sat on my lap.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.961
It was charming
and hilarious.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.397
Oh, that was a boy?

05:54.441 --> 05:56.356
Your scream sounds
like a girl's.

05:56.399 --> 05:57.487
Play your cards right,

05:57.531 --> 05:58.880
you'll hear that
girlish scream again.

05:58.923 --> 06:00.360
Why would I
want that?

06:00.403 --> 06:01.970
Hmm, this is so us.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.409
Hey.

06:06.453 --> 06:07.932
Well, there you are!

06:07.976 --> 06:10.457
And there you are!

06:10.500 --> 06:13.416
Did you send in
the contracts?
No.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.200
What about
the projections?Whoopsie.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.420
Melanie,
what's wrong?

06:17.464 --> 06:18.595
Where's the focus
and drive...

06:18.639 --> 06:20.641
...that's gonna make me
a thousand-aire?

06:20.684 --> 06:23.034
Ah, hi, Maya.Oh, hi.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.253
Hey, you.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.999
Would you excuse me?

06:38.528 --> 06:40.574
Joyce, now Melanie.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.227
Am I the only woman
who has entered this house

06:42.271 --> 06:43.838
that you haven't defiled?

06:43.881 --> 06:45.666
Jealousy is not
a good color on you.

06:45.709 --> 06:46.971
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

06:47.015 --> 06:48.582
You'll ruin her.

06:48.625 --> 06:51.149
Or she gets better.
That Statue of Liberty?

06:51.193 --> 06:53.587
No-good drunk when I found her.
That's a true story.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.589
Relax, Maya.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.112
You're so worried about
your little business.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.462
I can promise you nothing's
going to get in the way.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.638
Listen, I got
to pick up Taylor.

07:01.682 --> 07:03.814
Ooh. Mango juice?

07:03.858 --> 07:06.513
So thirsty.

07:06.556 --> 07:07.470
Mm.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.559
Mm-hmm. Mm.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.256
Mmm.

07:11.300 --> 07:14.738
What a bizarre manifestation
of sexuality.

07:14.782 --> 07:17.088
Aaron: All right.
Let's see your chemistry.

07:17.132 --> 07:19.439
This is the scene where
you two fall in love.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.571
He's talking about
the characters, of course.

07:21.615 --> 07:24.269
Aaron, do you know
how that sounded?

07:26.707 --> 07:29.579
"This was a mistake.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.581
Action."

07:31.625 --> 07:32.626
The only trophy
that matters to me

07:32.669 --> 07:34.758
is the magazine writer
standing in front of me.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.064
Kiss me.

07:38.327 --> 07:39.676
I really
don't want to.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.549
Uh, the line's, uh,
"What took you so long?"

07:42.592 --> 07:44.115
Yeah, but the book I read
said I can't act something

07:44.159 --> 07:45.421
that doesn't feel true.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.380
"Was that book
'How to Get Fired'?"

07:48.424 --> 07:51.079
Okay, uh...
We have options.

07:51.122 --> 07:53.734
Let's find a version of Ray
that you have chemistry with.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.300
Makeover montage!

07:56.606 --> 07:57.738
Is that a version?

07:57.781 --> 07:59.087
'Cause I don't like it.

08:00.567 --> 08:03.134
You guys, I can't get
your song out of my head.

08:03.178 --> 08:04.135
That's nice to hear.

08:04.179 --> 08:05.528
If you like that,
maybe you'd like

08:05.572 --> 08:06.921
one of
our original songs --

08:06.964 --> 08:08.662
anotherone of
our original songs.

08:08.705 --> 08:10.533
Shall we play
our protest song, boys?

08:10.577 --> 08:11.665
"Draft Dodger"!

08:11.708 --> 08:13.362
1, 2, 3, 4!

08:13.405 --> 08:14.537
♪ Uncle Sam

08:14.581 --> 08:17.932
♪ Don't ship me off
to fight in ♪

08:17.975 --> 08:19.716
And here we would
name some countries

08:19.760 --> 08:21.065
where there might be
a war going on,

08:21.109 --> 08:23.807
But really, it was an era
of unprecedented peace --

08:23.851 --> 08:26.767
Stop, stop. That song makes
me want to become emancipated.

08:26.810 --> 08:29.117
But "Satisfaction's"
a winner.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.292
You guys
should do shows.

08:30.335 --> 08:31.685
All right.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.817
"Satisfaction."
Here we go.

08:33.861 --> 08:36.298
I am
the world's first trillionaire.

08:36.341 --> 08:37.560
But as
my butler said...

08:37.604 --> 08:39.083
No.

08:39.127 --> 08:40.694
It's like
the Sarge said.

08:40.737 --> 08:42.652
Who cares if you're
the world's best sniper if --

08:42.696 --> 08:44.611
It's like
the Wolfman said --

08:44.654 --> 08:46.743
Who cares if you're
the best vampire in the world

08:46.787 --> 08:48.745
if you don't have love?

08:48.789 --> 08:49.616
Kiss me.

08:51.356 --> 08:54.577
Cut. "Sorry.
What is the problem?"

08:54.621 --> 08:55.578
I think
the problem's the script.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.931
He says,
"Great feedback.

09:00.975 --> 09:03.499
Come over for
a re-write tonight.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.718
Can't wait."

09:07.634 --> 09:09.200
Okay. I've got
a lot of stuff to go over.

09:09.244 --> 09:10.332
Let's get down
to business.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.464
Music to my ears.I've run the numbers.

09:12.508 --> 09:14.597
Kenneth has over
600 Facebook friends.

09:14.641 --> 09:15.946
550 of those are women.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.948
Now, okay, see, here's
where it gets interesting.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.341
Of the 14 Tiffanys,

09:19.384 --> 09:21.430
6 of them work
at the same Dry Bar,

09:21.473 --> 09:22.953
4 of them
have real '80s hair.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.651
Could we just
get down to work?

09:24.694 --> 09:26.478
It's just --Yeah.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.524
Hey, you. You...

09:28.568 --> 09:29.699
Big business meeting, huh?

09:29.743 --> 09:31.614
Uh, what time do you
figure you'll break?

09:31.658 --> 09:32.615
Probably around dinner.

09:32.659 --> 09:33.877
See, it was
just that, um,

09:33.921 --> 09:37.315
I had a little
picnic plan brewing.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.752
-Aww.
-You know what?

09:38.795 --> 09:40.231
Just take the rest
of the day off.

09:40.275 --> 09:42.016
You seem
a bit distracted.You don't mind?

09:42.059 --> 09:43.757
Go on.
Yeah, have fun.Thank you, partner.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.715
Okay.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.935
Maya, thanks
for being cool.

09:47.978 --> 09:50.154
Are we good?
You know what?
It's fine.

09:50.198 --> 09:51.678
I mean, her ex has
the kids this weekend,

09:51.721 --> 09:52.809
so we'll just
work then.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.637
Ooh, about that.

09:54.681 --> 09:57.248
I was cooking up
a surprise getaway.

09:57.292 --> 09:58.772
Well, I support that.
Yeah?

09:58.815 --> 10:00.948
Yeah. Just don't take
Melanie.

10:00.991 --> 10:02.950
I'm sorry. You can't.

10:02.993 --> 10:04.908
I can't?

10:04.952 --> 10:07.215
You said this wasn't
gonna get in the way,

10:07.258 --> 10:08.608
and it is in the way.

10:08.651 --> 10:09.739
You cannot have her.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.611
Oh, well, we will
just see about that.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.221
Yeah, we will.
Okay, then.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.789
I guess I'll just borrow
a picnic basket and go.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.834
Get out!

10:17.878 --> 10:19.793
Are you sure we're allowed
to practice here?

10:19.836 --> 10:21.490
The janitors
owed me a favor.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.622
Following up
on that later.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.624
A band with such
a fresh, new sound

10:24.667 --> 10:26.626
deserves a respectable
practice space.

10:26.669 --> 10:27.931
Look, Dylan.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.498
The truth is...

10:29.541 --> 10:31.935
Oh, no.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.894
Where did all these kids
come from?

10:33.937 --> 10:36.636
Dylan, seriously,
we're grown men.

10:36.679 --> 10:37.637
We're not playing
for a bunch of --

10:41.031 --> 10:42.946
I was so sure
I wasn't going to do it.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.774
That rocked!

10:46.080 --> 10:50.084
We're gonna do another one now
called "Draft Dodger"...

10:50.127 --> 10:52.042
Screw it! This one's
called "Born to Run."

10:52.086 --> 10:53.914
1, 2, 3, 4!

10:53.957 --> 10:56.699
"Layla."

10:56.743 --> 10:59.484
"Baba O'Riley."

10:59.528 --> 11:02.531
We call this one
"Side Two of Abbey Road."

11:02.574 --> 11:03.880
Thank you so much.

11:03.924 --> 11:04.968
We're gonna take a short break.
We'll be right back.

11:05.012 --> 11:07.710
Oh, Daddy, you're here.
Dylan's dad?

11:07.754 --> 11:08.972
This is my dad,
Todd.

11:09.016 --> 11:11.192
He's a record company
executive.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.368
I told him that
he should sign you.

11:13.411 --> 11:15.979
Their songs are,
like, instant classics.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.502
How does that
first one go?

11:18.765 --> 11:19.940
Um...

11:19.983 --> 11:22.812
I-I can't get no...

11:22.856 --> 11:24.988
satisfaction.

11:25.032 --> 11:27.948
I can't get no satisfaction,
so forth.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.558
And they're
great performers, too.

11:29.601 --> 11:31.603
Uh, do that dance you do
during the song.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.310
Something like that.

11:42.353 --> 11:43.659
What do you
think, Dad?

11:46.880 --> 11:48.533
I think
they're fantastic.

11:49.883 --> 11:52.363
And if I hadn't just
signed a similar act,

11:52.407 --> 11:54.888
we'd be begging
to work with you.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.283
T-Thank you.
That is really very generous.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.546
Uh, before I go,

12:01.590 --> 12:04.941
uh, I was wondering if any of
you want to play a song I wrote

12:04.985 --> 12:07.901
called "Smells Like
Teen Spirit."

12:07.944 --> 12:10.120
Sure.
Check out what
Daddy wrote, Addie.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.557
Izzy's parking.

12:12.601 --> 12:13.994
Let's fix this movie.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.735
Come on, man.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.345
Just write a script
that makes me look awesome

12:17.388 --> 12:19.608
and makes her
fall in love with me.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.392
You can do it.
You're a creative genius.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.569
-Hello.
-Izzy!

12:24.613 --> 12:27.485
All right. Time to salvage
this terrible script.

12:29.923 --> 12:32.055
How lucky you found
a women in business conference

12:32.099 --> 12:34.318
this weekend.
I know.
What are the chances?

12:34.362 --> 12:36.190
I should tell you that,
at times,

12:36.233 --> 12:38.932
it will feel like a dog show.Hmm.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.324
Melanie: It's too bad.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.370
Kenneth was disappointed when
I told him I was leaving town.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.764
Oh, he knows our business
comes first.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.853
And you know,
regarding Kenneth,

12:46.896 --> 12:48.898
there are a few things
that you should know.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.204
He --

12:51.901 --> 12:53.337
Is right here.

12:54.208 --> 12:54.991
Hey, you.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.257
It feels like
we're playing Wembley!

13:00.301 --> 13:02.738
Soak it up, guys,
because tonight,

13:02.782 --> 13:05.741
for these kids, we are
the greatest band in the world.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.438
I want
to sing one.

13:07.482 --> 13:08.962
I'm tired of backing
you guys up.

13:09.005 --> 13:11.138
But you can't sing.And you can't
play guitar,

13:11.181 --> 13:12.443
but it doesn't
stop you.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.141
Easy, guys. Let's --
Let's just play.

13:14.184 --> 13:17.057
This is all
so small-minded.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.101
I'm out of here.
Come on, babe.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.668
Who is she?!

13:19.711 --> 13:21.365
Forget it.
Uh, "Free Fallin'."

13:21.409 --> 13:23.193
Ah, let's do
something fresher.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.499
"Wonderwall."Uh, new guy,

13:24.542 --> 13:25.848
that's not
really our sound.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.154
Well, "Free Fallin'"
isn't your sound either.

13:27.197 --> 13:28.808
You stole it
from John Mellencamp.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.812
No, no, don't look that up.
No, put your phones away.

13:32.855 --> 13:33.987
It's Tom Petty.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.640
Also, yeah, dude,
it's Tom Petty.

13:35.684 --> 13:36.641
You're a music exec?

13:38.078 --> 13:40.994
JJ, we are banging our heads
against a wall here, man.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.691
Izzy, you hungry?

13:42.734 --> 13:44.040
What do you say to some of
my famous braciole?

13:44.084 --> 13:46.651
No.
I love our banter.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.392
JJ, you should use this
in the script.

13:51.178 --> 13:54.137
"I'm going to get
some fresh air.

13:54.181 --> 13:55.008
You enjoy."

13:55.051 --> 13:58.098
I'm too tired
to stand.

13:58.141 --> 13:59.926
"Wow, sounds tough."

13:59.969 --> 14:02.145
Right.
That was terrible. Um...

14:02.189 --> 14:04.278
I shouldn't talk at all.

14:04.321 --> 14:06.976
Oh, God,
I made it worse.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.239
Uh, "Come on.
I have an idea."

14:11.067 --> 14:12.503
Izzy: Okay.

14:12.547 --> 14:15.855
"Maybe a car hits her,
and he saves her."

14:15.898 --> 14:17.900
No.
Why is this so hard?

14:17.944 --> 14:21.034
You seem to understand human
behavior in your other movies.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.560
"You saw my movies?"

14:25.603 --> 14:27.301
Yeah.

14:27.344 --> 14:28.432
They're great.

14:30.347 --> 14:33.263
"I'm suddenly very open
to your input."

14:33.307 --> 14:35.700
Well,
I don't know what to do.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.572
I'm no good at connecting
with people.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.401
I once had a lizard
I got close to.

14:42.316 --> 14:45.014
"Was he a football star
or a war hero?"

14:45.058 --> 14:47.060
No.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.540
Oh, you're being
charming.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.107
Write him like that.

14:51.151 --> 14:55.024
He should be real,
not perfect,

14:55.068 --> 14:59.115
someone who has a hard time
putting themselves out there

14:59.159 --> 15:01.030
but does it anyway.

15:01.074 --> 15:04.077
And he doesn't have
to save her life, you know.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.079
In these movies, it's more
about, like, a touch,

15:06.122 --> 15:09.082
and they feel
a connection.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.999
You write scary well.

15:13.042 --> 15:13.956
Pretend like
you're scared.

15:16.176 --> 15:18.526
How sweet.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.702
-Did you guys plan this?

15:21.790 --> 15:22.965
Uh, pretty much.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.185
Such a fun surprise.

15:25.228 --> 15:26.316
Ooh, let me go
freshen up.

15:28.884 --> 15:32.496
How dare you come here
and ruin our weekend.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.629
You only brought her here
to ruin myweekend.

15:34.672 --> 15:36.239
You just don't want me
to be happy.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.545
This is about
our business,

15:37.588 --> 15:40.461
and it cannot survive
with you interfering.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.506
She's gonna
have to choose.
Yeah.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.944
Yeah, either a lifetime
of ripping off pants

15:44.987 --> 15:47.250
or your dumb
adaptive-clothing line.

15:49.861 --> 15:52.125
Oh, you had to Tiffany
yourself up, didn't you?

15:52.168 --> 15:54.388
Melanie,
we need to talk,

15:54.431 --> 15:55.998
all of us.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.434
Are you two
breaking up with me?

15:57.478 --> 15:59.523
Don't be ridiculous.Oh, absolutely not.

15:59.567 --> 16:02.613
But we do need you
to break up with one of us.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.009
-Yeah.
-Wait, what?

16:07.053 --> 16:10.926
Melanie, we both
care about you so much,

16:10.970 --> 16:13.189
but sharing you
just isn't working out.

16:13.233 --> 16:16.062
So we need you
to pick one of us.

16:16.105 --> 16:18.107
-Me.
-Oh, please.

16:18.151 --> 16:21.197
Let the woman whose life
was in shambles before
she met me think.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.330
Wow. Look, I'm just getting
to know both of you.

16:23.373 --> 16:24.722
And now you want me
to pick one or the other?

16:27.812 --> 16:29.205
I'm sorry.
I choose neither.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.383
No, see, no,
you have to choose one.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.867
Sweetheart,

16:38.910 --> 16:41.087
I know you're mad.
It's just...

16:42.262 --> 16:45.787
Life's hard, and it felt good
to get some glory,

16:45.830 --> 16:47.484
just for
one brief moment.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.965
I'm sorry.
Can you forgive me?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.402
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

16:52.446 --> 16:56.232
Well, I think
what happened is,

16:56.276 --> 16:59.061
you thought we wrote
"Satisfaction,"

16:59.105 --> 17:02.238
so I lied
and said I did.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.284
And that felt great.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.372
And then a bunch
of your friends

17:05.415 --> 17:06.764
thought we wrote
"Satisfaction."

17:06.808 --> 17:08.114
Then we got caught,

17:08.157 --> 17:10.899
and then
I bought chocolate milk,

17:10.942 --> 17:11.943
and now we're here,
yeah.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.425
-So no takeaway?

17:15.469 --> 17:17.210
Not really, no.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.038
No, I think
I'm just an idiot.

17:19.081 --> 17:22.345
Well, I guess you could say
that we lived dangerously,

17:22.389 --> 17:23.477
we paid the price,

17:23.520 --> 17:25.914
and we -- we survived
to tell the tale.

17:25.957 --> 17:30.266
And that is what
rock 'n' roll is all about.

17:30.310 --> 17:31.876
Now, see, that feels
like a takeaway.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.792
I learned nothing,
and I would do it again.

17:34.836 --> 17:37.360
In fact, do you have any friends
who weren't here tonight

17:37.404 --> 17:39.145
but also don't know
a lot about music?

17:39.188 --> 17:41.234
The track team?The track team.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.583
Right in front of me
all this time.

17:42.626 --> 17:44.367
Come on.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.108
Why can't you be
more like her?

17:46.152 --> 17:48.545
And she chose neither of us.
It's over.

17:48.589 --> 17:50.199
You didn't even
fight for her?

17:50.243 --> 17:53.420
As the lead
in a romantic comedy,

17:53.463 --> 17:57.337
I know you cannot
take no for an answer.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.600
"Actually, Izzy pointed out
that trope

17:59.643 --> 18:01.471
has a really toxic
message."

18:01.515 --> 18:03.517
"Don't take no
for an answer."

18:03.560 --> 18:05.084
I like it.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.259
Yeah. Impress her.

18:06.302 --> 18:08.130
Win a karate tournament.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.175
Become a billionaire

18:09.218 --> 18:11.351
and save the dumb dock
where her dad works.

18:11.394 --> 18:12.917
What was I thinking?

18:12.961 --> 18:15.094
Melanie and I
are meant to be together.

18:15.137 --> 18:18.053
I'm gonna stop talking
to my diverse sidekicks

18:18.097 --> 18:19.359
and go
and get the girl.

18:22.666 --> 18:23.624
Where are you going?

18:23.667 --> 18:26.279
To get more
mango juice.

18:26.322 --> 18:28.281
Good luck getting
Melanie back, Mom!

18:28.324 --> 18:30.196
You're blocking me in!

18:30.239 --> 18:32.154
Then I guess
I'll get there first!

18:35.810 --> 18:37.203
Maya, get out.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.204
I'm winning her back,

18:38.247 --> 18:39.683
and I'm not taking no
for an answer.

18:39.727 --> 18:43.339
Do you have any idea
how toxic that trope is?

18:44.340 --> 18:47.691
We need to talk.Shh! It's the library.

18:47.735 --> 18:49.345
I've been quiet
long enough.

18:49.389 --> 18:51.260
I didn't
go looking for this,

18:51.304 --> 18:53.393
but I felt something
last night.

18:54.611 --> 18:56.526
Don't listen to him.
He's just going to hurt you.

18:56.570 --> 18:57.440
Shh!

18:57.484 --> 19:00.095
I have to work so hard

19:00.139 --> 19:01.444
to be understood,

19:01.488 --> 19:02.880
but you just saw me.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.056
It was scary.
Izzy: Oh.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.450
Should I
leave you alone?

19:07.494 --> 19:09.409
That scares me
even more.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.500
Wow.
That was really good.

19:13.543 --> 19:16.067
Um, should I
kiss him?

19:19.201 --> 19:21.508
Where did you
find this girl? Yes!

19:21.551 --> 19:24.163
Kenneth, I understand
why you're upset.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.686
I mean,
I know you like Melanie.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.557
But you have
to understand --

19:27.601 --> 19:29.951
with JJ going away
to college next year --

19:29.994 --> 19:31.909
Maya, this isn't
about you.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.999
Are you sure?
Feels like it is.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.610
You know why you've never
seen me in a relationship?

19:36.653 --> 19:38.960
Because ever since
I met you,

19:39.003 --> 19:42.268
my whole life has been
about you and your family.

19:42.311 --> 19:44.357
But who cares.

19:44.400 --> 19:48.274
In Maya-land, nothing exists
outside of the DiMeos.

19:48.317 --> 19:50.493
Well, I get
to have something, too.

19:50.537 --> 19:53.540
Oh, Kenneth, I can really
see how you feel.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.326
Maya!

19:58.893 --> 20:01.765
Come on!
I gave you a ride, lady!

20:01.809 --> 20:04.028
Let me have this!

20:05.421 --> 20:07.510
What are you
doing here?
Melanie,

20:07.554 --> 20:09.425
you are
an amazing woman,

20:09.469 --> 20:12.254
and you deserve to have
an equally amazing partner.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.300
Now, maybe we can
work this out

20:14.343 --> 20:16.650
where you don't have to choose
between me or Kenneth.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.739
But if you have
to choose...

20:18.782 --> 20:21.394
Can you hear my voice
at this level?

20:21.437 --> 20:22.960
Choose Kenneth.

20:23.004 --> 20:24.310
Really?
But you're still mad at him.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.355
Well, I mean,
things got weird.

20:26.399 --> 20:27.748
But, you know,

20:27.791 --> 20:31.142
I like how he dresses like
it's summer all year round.

20:31.186 --> 20:33.101
And I love
how he sings

20:33.144 --> 20:35.321
what he needs to tell you
when he could...

20:35.364 --> 20:38.411
♪ Just bloody say it

20:40.500 --> 20:43.416
But, I mean, what I like best
about him is that he's kind

20:43.459 --> 20:45.505
and he's fantastic
with my son

20:45.548 --> 20:48.899
and he has a very,
very big heart.

20:48.943 --> 20:50.684
And he really likes you,
Melanie.

20:50.727 --> 20:53.513
Well, shouldn't he
be telling me all this?

20:53.556 --> 20:54.557
I'm the one
sacrificing you,

20:54.601 --> 20:56.080
so I didn't want him
coming in here

20:56.124 --> 20:57.386
and messing it all up.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.432
Plus,
I wanted the big moment.

20:59.475 --> 21:02.086
Please forgive him,

21:02.130 --> 21:04.393
and I promise
I won't interfere anymore.

21:09.398 --> 21:10.356
Hey, you.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.358
Oh, God, you heard.

21:12.401 --> 21:17.450
♪ You're so special
to me ♪

21:18.494 --> 21:20.757
Oh. Oh, right.

21:23.456 --> 21:24.326
Ew.
