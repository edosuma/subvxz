00:06.834 --> 00:08.166
PREVIOUSLY ON
"PRIVATE PRACTICE"...

00:08.208 --> 00:11.291
THE THREE FETUSES ARE JUST TOO
MUCH FOR YOUR BODY TO HANDLE.

00:11.333 --> 00:14.166
THEY'RE 20 WEEKS. A FEW MORE,
AND THEY'LL BE VIABLE.
I CAN'T LOSE MY WIFE.

00:14.208 --> 00:16.417
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SICK?
I WAS DIAGNOSED
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

00:16.458 --> 00:17.917
DOES NAOMI KNOW?
NO.

00:17.959 --> 00:20.750
THE SEX DIDN'T HAVE TO MEAN
WE WERE A HAPPY COUPLE AGAIN,

00:20.792 --> 00:23.542
BUT IT HAD TO MEAN SOMETHING.
THAT MOMENT HAS PASSED.
WE CAN MOVE ON WITH OUR LIVES.

00:23.583 --> 00:25.542
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU.
(Pete) HE HAS
A RIGHT TO BE MAD.

00:25.583 --> 00:27.667
YOU TOLD HIM
YOU COULDN'T BE WITH HIM

00:27.709 --> 00:30.041
AND YOU STARTED
SLEEPING WITH ME.
BUT YOU ARE NOT THE EX-HUSBAND
OF MY BEST FRIEND.

00:30.083 --> 00:33.041
I WAS COMING UP HERE TO TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME TODAY,

00:33.083 --> 00:37.542
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
ALL THE REAL ACTION IS UP HERE.

00:37.583 --> 00:40.542
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

00:40.583 --> 00:43.583
(ventilator
clicking and hissing)

01:09.917 --> 01:11.458
HE'S STILL HERE.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.458
(Sam) I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.000
YOUR WIFE DECIDES TO BE
A SURROGATE,

01:16.041 --> 01:18.000
AND SHE ENDS UP IN A COMA,

01:18.041 --> 01:20.000
PREGNANT WITH
SOMEONE ELSE'S TRIPLETS.

01:20.041 --> 01:22.041
HE WON'T GO HOME.

01:22.083 --> 01:25.166
HE JUST SITS THERE,
TALKING TO HER.

01:25.208 --> 01:27.041
IT'S AWFUL.

01:27.083 --> 01:29.041
HE LOVES HER.
ADDISON...

01:29.083 --> 01:32.041
I HAVE TO CHECK
ON THE FETUSES.
ADDISON, IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

01:32.083 --> 01:35.041
YOU COULD'VE KEPT
YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

01:35.083 --> 01:37.041
SHE SAW US. SHE KNEW.

01:37.083 --> 01:40.458
THERE WAS NOTHING TO SEE.
NOTHING HAPPENED. WHEN YOU--
NOTHING HAPPENED, REALLY?

01:40.500 --> 01:42.959
SO THERE'S--THERE'S NOTHING
FOR NAOMI TO BE MAD ABOUT?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.959
WE NEVER--
SHE SAW WHAT SHE SAW
BECAUSE IT WAS THERE.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.041
NOW MAYBE YOU'RE AFRAID
TO ACT ON IT, BUT IT WAS THERE.

01:49.083 --> 01:52.041
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, THAT IT
WOULD BE BETTER IF WE HAD--

01:52.083 --> 01:54.291
I MEAN, IF YOU AND I
HAD SLEPT TOGETHER,

01:54.333 --> 01:56.959
YOU'RE SAYING IT WOULD BE OKAY
THAT NAOMI IS MAD?
THEN AT LEAST
WE COULD BE TOGETHER

01:57.000 --> 01:59.959
INSTEAD OF WHATEVER THIS IS.
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE IS TO YOU,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.041
BUT SHE IS IMPORTANT TO ME.
SHE'S MY--SHE'S EVERYTHING.

02:03.083 --> 02:05.291
SO THEN WHAT AM I?

02:05.333 --> 02:08.250
YOU... HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,
AND I HAVE PETE.

02:08.291 --> 02:10.875
SO WE ARE NOTHING.
I HAVE TO GO.

02:10.917 --> 02:12.250
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

02:12.291 --> 02:14.166
(ventilator
clicking and hissing)

02:14.208 --> 02:16.000
EDDIE.

02:17.583 --> 02:20.917
YOU SHOULD EAT SOMETHING,
HAVE SOME COFFEE.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.750
WE FOUGHT ABOUT IT,
YOU KNOW...

02:25.792 --> 02:27.667
HER DOING THIS

02:27.709 --> 02:29.375
CARRYING THESE BABIES.

02:29.417 --> 02:33.041
I TOLD HER
I DIDN'T WANT HER TO.

02:33.083 --> 02:36.041
I TOLD HER THAT WE COULD MANAGE
WITHOUT THE EXTRA MONEY.

02:36.083 --> 02:38.625
EDDIE,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

02:38.667 --> 02:42.166
I WAS ALREADY WORKING TWO JOBS,
AND WE WERE JUST SCRAPING.

02:42.208 --> 02:46.041
SHE WANTED TO HELP.

02:46.083 --> 02:49.041
(crying) SHE AGREED TO BE
A SURROGATE, YOU KNOW, NOT A--

02:49.083 --> 02:50.834
AN INCUBATOR.
I'M SO SORRY.

02:50.875 --> 02:53.041
YOU KNOW, WHAT--
WHAT IF SHE'S AWARE?

02:53.083 --> 02:55.583
I MEAN, WHAT--WHAT IF
SHE'S IN PAIN?

02:55.625 --> 02:57.041
LOOK AT HER.

02:57.083 --> 02:59.208
LOOK AT HER.

02:59.250 --> 03:02.041
SHE'S IN LIMBO,
I'M... IN HELL,

03:02.083 --> 03:04.333
AND MY KIDS ARE A WRECK,

03:04.375 --> 03:07.041
AND ALL OF YOU JUST SIT AROUND
HOVERING AND--AND WAITING

03:07.083 --> 03:10.041
TILL YOU CAN EMPTY HER OUT
AND THROW HER AWAY.

03:10.083 --> 03:12.041
IT'S NOT RIGHT.
EDDIE, COME WITH ME, OKAY?

03:12.083 --> 03:14.041
LET'S GET SOME FOOD
OR SOME COFFEE.

03:14.083 --> 03:16.041
JUST SOME FRESH AIR.
NO.

03:16.083 --> 03:17.625
YOU NEED A BREAK.

03:17.667 --> 03:20.041
SHE WOULDN'T WANT THIS,
TO BE LIKE THIS.

03:22.083 --> 03:24.041
(sighs)
I WANT TO PULL THE PLUG.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I CAN DO THAT, RIGHT?

03:36.083 --> 03:38.667
HE WOULDN'T JUST BE
PULLING THE PLUG ON KAYLA.

03:38.709 --> 03:41.500
WHAT ABOUT THE BABIES
SHE'S CARRYING?
I UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION.

03:41.542 --> 03:44.458
AND IT DOESN'T HORRIFY YOU?
THE FETUSES AREN'T VIABLE
OUTSIDE OF THE WOMB.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.291
EDDIE ASKED ME TO EXPLAIN
THE PROCESS TO HIM,

03:47.333 --> 03:50.083
NOT SECOND-GUESS
HIS MORAL JUDGMENTS.
WELL, THERE ARE
TWO PEOPLE DOWN THE HALL

03:50.125 --> 03:52.875
WHO ARE THE PARENTS
OF THOSE BABIES.

03:52.917 --> 03:55.083
THEY SHOULD HAVE A SAY.
I'M SORRY KAYLA'S IN A COMA.

03:55.125 --> 03:57.667
BUT SHE'S NOT IN ANY PAIN,
AND IF YOU REALLY THINK

03:57.709 --> 04:00.041
IT'S SOMEHOW MORE HUMANE
TO EUTHANIZE HER THAN TO

04:00.083 --> 04:03.417
KEEP HER ALIVE LONG ENOUGH
TO BRING THREE BABIES TO TERM--
OKAY, THE TIME TO STOP THIS

04:03.458 --> 04:06.041
WAS BEFORE YOU CONVINCED KAYLA
TO ROLL THE DICE.
YOU--

04:06.083 --> 04:08.417
CALM DOWN, THE BOTH OF YOU.
NOW WE ARE WHERE WE ARE.

04:08.458 --> 04:10.417
EVEN THOUGH NONE OF US
ARE COMFORTABLE

04:10.458 --> 04:13.417
WITH WHAT EDDIE WANTS,
ADDISON IS RIGHT.

04:13.458 --> 04:15.625
WE'RE OBLIGATED TO HONOR IT.

04:15.667 --> 04:18.041
KAYLA'S ONLY ONE OF
THE PATIENTS IN THAT ROOM.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.834
THERE ARE THREE OTHERS,

04:20.875 --> 04:22.834
AND SOMEONE
NEEDS TO PROTECT THEM.

04:22.875 --> 04:25.041
I'M GONNA
TALK TO ANGIE AND SIMON.

04:25.083 --> 04:29.083
YOU'D BE KILLING THREE BABIES.
HOW CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THAT?
YOU KILLED MY WIFE.

04:29.125 --> 04:32.083
DO ANY OF YOU
GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THAT?
ALL RIGHT, COULD WE ALL JUST
TAKE THIS INTO THE HALL?

04:32.125 --> 04:34.500
WE ASKED EDDIE
TO TALK OUTSIDE.

04:34.542 --> 04:38.625
HE WOULDN'T LEAVE KAYLA.
I'M SORRY. I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING
IF THIS HADN'T HAPPENED.

04:38.667 --> 04:42.291
KAYLA IS A WONDERFUL PERSON.
SHE'S GIVEN US EVERYTHING.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.917
BUT SHE WANTED TO DO THIS,
EDDIE.

04:44.959 --> 04:47.792
SHE WANTED TO CARRY THESE
BABIES. YOU KNOW SHE DID.
SHE NEVER WANTED
TO LIVE LIKE THIS.

04:47.834 --> 04:49.166
LISTEN TO THAT THING.

04:49.208 --> 04:51.458
IT SHOVES AIR INTO HER
AND IT SUCKS IT OUT.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.041
SHE'S HOOKED UP TO THIS,
THIS, A-ALL THIS CRAP.

04:54.083 --> 04:57.041
THAT'S NOT LIFE.
I WANT HER TO HAVE PEACE.

04:57.083 --> 04:59.709
SHE WILL.
NOW!

05:02.083 --> 05:05.041
I MEAN, I KNEW IT WAS TIME
TO MOVE OUT OF NAOMI'S HOUSE,

05:05.083 --> 05:07.709
BUT BETSEY HATES
THE NEW APARTMENT. I HATE IT.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.709
THE CARPETS ARE BEIGE.
THE WALLS ARE BEIGE.

05:09.750 --> 05:12.041
THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS BEIGE.
MY WHOLE LIFE IS BEIGE.

05:12.083 --> 05:14.041
UH-HUH.
DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOU'RE,

05:14.083 --> 05:15.792
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
JUST TREADING WATER?

05:15.834 --> 05:18.500
NOTHING'S MOVING FORWARD.
YOU'RE STANDING STILL.

05:18.542 --> 05:21.750
EVERYBODY ELSE--
NO, I DON'T.
HERE'S SOME FREE ADVICE.

05:21.792 --> 05:24.500
KINDERGARTEN'S OVER.
TRAINING WHEELS ARE OFF.

05:24.542 --> 05:27.041
NOBODY'S GONNA CATCH YOU
IF YOU FALL.

05:27.083 --> 05:29.500
IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR LIFE,
YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

05:29.542 --> 05:31.166
YOU REACH DOWN,

05:31.208 --> 05:33.583
YOU PULL ONE FOOT OUT OF
THE MUD, THEN THE OTHER.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.000
YOU WALK AWAY FROM IT.
YOU CAN'T WALK, YOU CRAWL.

05:36.041 --> 05:38.792
YOU DO SOMETHING. JOIN A GYM.
JOIN A CLUB. JOIN A CULT.

05:38.834 --> 05:40.375
DO SOMETHING, ANYTHING.

05:40.417 --> 05:42.625
WHAT YOU DON'T DO
IS WHINE TO ME ABOUT IT.

05:50.542 --> 05:52.083
WHAT?

05:52.125 --> 05:54.959
ADDISON IS HEARTBROKEN
YOU WON'T SPEAK WITH HER.

05:55.041 --> 05:57.208
I'M NOT GONNA
TALK ABOUT IT.

05:57.250 --> 06:00.041
IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WORK,
THAT'S FINE.

06:00.083 --> 06:02.750
OKAY. WELL, LUCAS IS SICK.
THE NANNY JUST CALLED.

06:02.792 --> 06:05.000
SHE'S SICK NOW, TOO,
SO I GOTTA GO.

06:05.041 --> 06:08.250
I'LL PROBABLY BE OUT
A DAY OR TWO.
OKAY, WHATEVER YOU NEED.

06:08.291 --> 06:10.542
PETE.

06:10.583 --> 06:13.125
I HOPE THE LITTLE GUY
FEELS BETTER.

06:13.166 --> 06:14.959
THANK YOU.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.125
(motor whirs)

06:18.166 --> 06:21.041
OKAY, I-I-I KNOW WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT THE KISSING.

06:21.083 --> 06:23.041
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN
AVOIDING YOU.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.458
I HAVEN'T.
IT'S JUST THAT, UH...

06:25.500 --> 06:27.041
I'M SEEING WILLIAM,
AND I--

06:27.083 --> 06:30.166
WILLIAM'S OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
SWITZERLAND, ON BUSINESS.

06:30.208 --> 06:33.291
NO, HE'S NOT. NO.
WE HAVE A DATE TONIGHT.

06:33.333 --> 06:36.375
IT'S CANCELED.

06:36.417 --> 06:38.291
HE LEFT? FOR HOW LONG?

06:38.333 --> 06:41.458
HE DIDN'T SAY.
AND HE TOLD YOU?

06:41.500 --> 06:44.458
WOW.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.667
THAT'S GREAT.

06:46.709 --> 06:49.000
YEAH, THAT'S JUST...

06:49.041 --> 06:51.000
GREAT.

06:51.041 --> 06:52.667
NAOMI.

06:52.709 --> 06:55.458
(motor whirs)

06:58.291 --> 07:01.291
THIS IS THE MONEY I OWE YOU
FOR THE BUY-IN ON THE PRACTICE.

07:01.333 --> 07:04.917
I KNOW I WAS KIND OF
A JERK ABOUT IT AT THE TIME,

07:04.959 --> 07:08.208
BUT THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR FLOATING ME.
YOU SURE YOU CAN AFFORD IT?

07:08.250 --> 07:10.834
YEAH. I'M GOOD. I'VE BEEN
PUTTING MONEY ASIDE.

07:10.875 --> 07:13.333
DIDN'T WANT THE DEBT
HANGING OVER ME.

07:13.375 --> 07:16.458
I NEVER MADE AN ISSUE OF IT.
WASN'T ABOUT THE MONEY.
YEAH, MONEY'S USUALLY
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.041
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
NOTHING.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.041
YOU LENT ME MONEY.
I'M PAYING YOU BACK.

07:21.083 --> 07:24.208
I'M TRYING TO BE A GROWN-UP.
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.
IS VIOLET BACK?

07:24.250 --> 07:26.208
BECAUSE THIS WHOLE
GROWN-UP THING SOUNDS LIKE--

07:26.250 --> 07:29.959
SHE'S NOT BACK.
I'M GROWING UP ALL ON MY OWN.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.750
TAKE THE CHECK.

07:36.083 --> 07:39.458
IS THIS THE LAST THING
BETWEEN US?

07:39.500 --> 07:41.458
DON'T MAKE IT
MORE THAN IT IS.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.125
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID
MONEY'S NOT ABOUT MONEY.

07:44.166 --> 07:46.834
SOMETIMES IT IS.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.250
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:05.291 --> 08:07.583
CHARLOTTE,
THIS ISN'T THE--

08:07.625 --> 08:09.959
SHUT UP, SHELDON.

08:15.542 --> 08:18.625
HOW LONG TILL
THE BABIES ARE VIABLE?

08:18.667 --> 08:22.041
SIX, SEVEN WEEKS.
LOOK, IF YOU WOULD
JUST GIVE US THAT.

08:22.083 --> 08:23.959
NO.
(Charlotte) MR. LINDY.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.041
I'M CHARLOTTE KING,
HOSPITAL CHIEF OF STAFF.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.041
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

08:28.083 --> 08:30.500
UH... I HAVE
A MEDICAL POWER OF ATTORNEY,

08:30.542 --> 08:33.333
AND I WANT TO TAKE MY WIFE
OFF OF LIFE SUPPORT.

08:33.375 --> 08:35.834
SHE'S CARRYING OUR BABIES.
NOW I TOLD YOU
WHAT I WANT--

08:35.875 --> 08:38.417
WE GOT A LAWYER.

08:38.458 --> 08:40.041
LOOK...

08:40.083 --> 08:42.750
WE DIDN'T WANT THIS
TO BECOME A LEGAL THING,

08:42.792 --> 08:45.041
BUT NOW...
MAYBE IT HAS TO.

08:45.083 --> 08:47.041
YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT.
(Charlotte)
ACTUALLY, MR. LINDY,

08:47.083 --> 08:49.041
A JUDGE WILL HAVE TO
DECIDE THAT.

08:49.083 --> 08:51.208
I SUGGEST YOU GET
AN ATTORNEY OF YOUR OWN.

08:51.250 --> 08:53.041
BUT SHE'S MY WIFE.

08:53.083 --> 08:55.041
I KNOW THAT,
AND I'M SO SORRY.

08:55.083 --> 08:58.250
BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW, I NEED
EVERYONE OUT OF THIS ROOM.

08:58.291 --> 08:59.875
I'M NOT LEAVING.

08:59.917 --> 09:02.458
YOU ARE. TILL THIS IS LEGALLY
RESOLVED, I HAVE TO ACT.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.208
ESSENTIAL MEDICAL PERSONNEL
ONLY IN THIS ROOM.

09:05.250 --> 09:07.208
I-I'M NOT LEAVING
MY WIFE ALONE.

09:07.250 --> 09:10.583
I'M NOT KEEPING MY KIDS
FROM SEEING THEIR MOTHER.

09:10.625 --> 09:13.041
I REALLY AM SORRY.

09:13.083 --> 09:16.166
(scoffs) HOW DID YOU
LET THIS HAPPEN?

09:16.208 --> 09:20.417
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

09:23.875 --> 09:25.834
I WANT TO
HELP HIM SOMEHOW.

09:25.875 --> 09:27.834
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO.

09:27.875 --> 09:30.834
IT'S A LEGAL THING,
NOT MEDICAL. WE'RE OUT OF IT.

09:30.875 --> 09:34.250
IT'S JUST HORRIBLE. THERE ARE
NO--NO GOOD OPTIONS.
SOMETIMES, IT'S--

09:37.458 --> 09:39.208
JUST LET HER GO.
NO. NAI.

09:39.250 --> 09:42.208
SAM AND I NEVER MEANT TO HAVE
FEELINGS FOR EACH OTHER.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.208
IT JUST HAPPENED.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.375
BUT IT NEVER WENT ANYWHERE
BECAUSE OF YOU.

09:46.417 --> 09:49.125
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT ME.
(scoffs) MAD?

09:49.166 --> 09:51.750
NAI.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.041
DID YOU EVER LOVE ME?

09:54.083 --> 09:55.458
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.417
WAS I SECOND CHOICE?
WHEN DID ALL THIS START?

09:57.458 --> 09:59.417
WHEN--WHEN WE WERE
IN MED SCHOOL?
NO.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.750
WH-WHEN YOU WERE MAID OF HONOR
AT MY WEDDING?

10:01.792 --> 10:03.667
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT, NAOMI.

10:03.709 --> 10:06.667
IT IS LIKE THAT.
I-I CAN'T STOP WONDERING.

10:06.709 --> 10:09.250
EVERYTHING IS TAINTED
WITH THIS.

10:09.291 --> 10:11.667
HE--HE IS THE FATHER

10:11.709 --> 10:14.041
OF MY CHILD, ADDISON,
AND THERE'S A BOND THERE,

10:14.083 --> 10:16.250
AND MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
EXPECT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

10:16.291 --> 10:20.041
BUT YOU DON'T GET FRIENDSHIP?
THAT'S WHY WE BACKED OFF,
NAOMI, FRIENDSHIP.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.166
GOD, I...
I'M SECOND-GUESSING

10:22.208 --> 10:25.166
EVERYTHING THAT HAS
EVER HAPPENED BETWEEN US.

10:25.208 --> 10:29.041
I'VE LOST EVERY GOOD MEMORY
OF OUR MARRIAGE...

10:29.083 --> 10:31.041
AND OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.

10:31.083 --> 10:34.500
NO, NO,
I AM NOT MAD.

10:34.542 --> 10:36.041
(sniffles)

10:36.083 --> 10:37.875
YOU TWO HAVE...

10:37.917 --> 10:39.959
BROKEN MY HEART.

10:45.917 --> 10:47.250
(Lucas crying)
(Addison) PETE?

10:47.291 --> 10:49.583
(nasal voice)
IN THE KITCHEN.

10:49.625 --> 10:51.333
WE LEFT
HIS SPECIAL BLANKET HERE.

10:51.375 --> 10:53.333
I THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP
CALM HIM DOWN. (sneezes)

10:53.375 --> 10:55.125
OH. ARE YOU SICK?
OH.

10:55.166 --> 10:57.125
AW, YOU HAVE A FEVER.
OH, YEAH, STAY AWAY.

10:57.166 --> 10:59.083
YOU DON'T WANT THIS.
TRUST ME.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.125
I-I FELT FINE
A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO.

11:01.166 --> 11:04.041
OH, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE
CARE OF HIM WHEN YOU'RE SICK.

11:04.083 --> 11:06.041
YEAH, WELL, IT DOESN'T WORK
THAT WAY. IT'S MY JOB.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.333
YOU KNOW WHAT? (kisses)
LET ME HELP.

11:08.375 --> 11:10.959
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.
YOU GUYS HAVE STUFF HERE.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.959
JUST GO UPSTAIRS
AND GO TO SLEEP.
ARE YOU SURE?
HE'S GOT A FEVER.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.542
HE'S GONNA BE CRANKY.
(fussing)

11:15.583 --> 11:17.959
MY HOUSE, MY RULES.
I'M A BABY DOCTOR.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.542
(chuckles)
WE WILL BE FINE.
ALL RIGHT? GO TO BED.

11:20.583 --> 11:22.542
THANK YOU.
(crying)

11:22.583 --> 11:24.041
HUH?
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.041
(motor whirring)

11:26.083 --> 11:27.583
(candy clatters)

11:27.625 --> 11:29.166
BINGE EATING.

11:29.208 --> 11:31.625
OH, JUST SHUT UP.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.625
(chuckles) WILLIAM LEAVING
GETS YOU THAT UPSET?

11:33.667 --> 11:36.041
NO. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS.
THERE ARE--

11:36.083 --> 11:39.041
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
THAT ARE WRONG AT ONCE.

11:39.083 --> 11:41.041
DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT?

11:41.083 --> 11:44.041
NO. WHAT I WANT IS FOR THIS
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.542
PUT THE CHOCOLATE DOWN
AND COME HERE.
OH, GABRIEL--

11:46.583 --> 11:49.000
CHOCOLATE DOWN NOW.

11:51.083 --> 11:53.583
(candy clatters)

11:53.625 --> 11:56.208
WHAT?

11:56.250 --> 11:59.417
COME HERE.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.417
SIT DOWN.
NO--

12:03.458 --> 12:05.375
SIT DOWN.

12:05.417 --> 12:07.250
(sighs)

12:27.250 --> 12:29.125
MM.

12:34.250 --> 12:37.834
NOW ISN'T THAT
BETTER THAN CHOCOLATE?

12:40.250 --> 12:43.834
SO, UM, WHY ARE YOU HERE
INSTEAD OF DR. MONTGOMERY?

12:43.875 --> 12:46.875
SHE HAS SOMEONE
SICK AT HOME.
THE BABY
JUST HIT EIGHT MONTHS.

12:46.917 --> 12:49.125
I WAS HOPING SHE'D TELL ME
IT WAS TIME TO GET OFF THE COUCH

12:49.166 --> 12:51.125
AND JUST LET THE BABY
COME WHEN IT COMES.

12:51.166 --> 12:53.125
BED REST IS STARTING
TO MAKE ME CRAZY.

12:53.166 --> 12:55.917
WELL, MAYBE I CAN TELL YOU THAT
AFTER I DO THE EXAM. OKAY.

12:55.959 --> 12:57.709
YOU'RE REALLY YOUNG,
AREN'T YOU?

12:57.750 --> 13:00.041
HOW LONG SINCE YOU
GOT OUT OF MED SCHOOL?

13:00.083 --> 13:02.083
I'M NOT A DOCTOR.
I'M A MIDWIFE.

13:02.125 --> 13:05.041
IS SHE REALLY UNAVAILABLE?

13:05.083 --> 13:07.417
CAN WE CALL HER?

13:07.458 --> 13:10.000
(Addison) OKAY. YEAH.
(Lucas crying)

13:10.041 --> 13:12.250
JUST EXPLAIN TO HER THAT
YOU HAVE TO CHECK HER CERVIX.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.250
If it's dilated,
send her to the hospital.

13:14.291 --> 13:16.667
If not, just check again
tomorrow, okay?

13:16.709 --> 13:20.041
NO, I KNOW ALL THAT. UH, SHE
JUST WANTED TO CONSULT YOU.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.917
CAN'T WE JUST RESCHEDULE?!
NO OFFENSE.
(Lucas continues crying)

13:22.959 --> 13:24.291
(mouths words)

13:24.333 --> 13:27.667
(crying)
COME ON, BABY.
TRY TO RELAX.

13:27.709 --> 13:31.875
UH, ADDISON, UH,
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
He's just been up all night.

13:31.917 --> 13:34.250
I can't... get him
to be comfortable.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.083
I'm good with babies, Dell.

13:36.125 --> 13:38.542
I AM. IT'S MY JOB
TO BE GOOD WITH BABIES.

13:38.583 --> 13:40.542
BUT I CANNOT
GET HIM COMFORTABLE.

13:40.583 --> 13:42.041
Huh? Come on.

13:42.083 --> 13:44.041
ADDISON, ADDISON,
JUST--JUST HOLD HIM.

13:44.083 --> 13:46.500
YOU KNOW, TALK SOFTLY TO HIM,

13:46.542 --> 13:49.166
let him feel your heartbeat
and smell your presence...
YEAH?

13:49.208 --> 13:51.166
AND, UH,
LISTEN TO YOUR VOICE.

13:51.208 --> 13:53.542
JUST TALK TO HIM CALMLY,
SMILE AT HIM, AND JUST,

13:53.583 --> 13:55.709
YOU KNOW, KEEP DOING THAT
TILL IT WORKS.

13:55.750 --> 13:57.083
SOMETIMES WITH A SICK BABY,

13:57.125 --> 13:59.083
IT'S NOT SO MUCH
ABOUT DOING SOMETHING

13:59.125 --> 14:01.542
AS BEING SOMETHING.
Being something. Okay.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.625
OKAY. THANKS, DELL. BYE.
(continues crying)

14:05.125 --> 14:06.709
(sighs)

14:06.750 --> 14:09.959
WOW. YOU'RE GOOD.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.959
CHECK WHATEVER YOU NEED
TO CHECK.

14:16.792 --> 14:19.458
THANK YOU.

14:21.208 --> 14:24.000
AM I NOT ALLOWED
TO SIT IN THE HALL NOW?

14:24.041 --> 14:26.000
I KNOW
YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS,

14:26.041 --> 14:28.375
BUT I HATE THIS
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

14:28.417 --> 14:31.458
NO... YOU DON'T.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.250
YOU CAN'T.

14:33.291 --> 14:36.250
HAVE YOU TALKED TO ANYONE?
SOMEONE WHO COULD HELP YOU.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.250
HELP ME WHAT, FIGHT THEM?

14:38.291 --> 14:39.875
I'VE CALLED THREE LAWYERS.

14:39.917 --> 14:42.875
ALL OF 'EM WANT MONEY
THAT I DON'T HAVE.

14:42.917 --> 14:46.542
THEY ALL SAY THAT IT'LL TAKE
TIME THAT I DON'T HAVE.

14:46.583 --> 14:49.583
YOU WON'T EVEN LET ME
BE IN THERE WITH MY WIFE.

14:49.625 --> 14:52.041
ALL OF YOU SAY THAT KAYLA...

14:52.083 --> 14:54.000
DOESN'T KNOW
THAT I'M THERE.

14:56.083 --> 14:59.792
BUT I KNOW THAT SHE DOES.

14:59.834 --> 15:02.333
(clicks pens)

15:04.875 --> 15:07.417
THIS IS AN ATTORNEY
AT A NONPROFIT AID GROUP.

15:07.458 --> 15:08.625
(writes)

15:08.667 --> 15:11.208
TELL 'EM I REFERRED YOU.

15:14.834 --> 15:16.709
WHY ARE YOU HELPING ME?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.250
JUST CALL.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.542
SOMETIMES YOU SURPRISE ME.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.542
I HAVE A ROLE
AT THE HOSPITAL.

15:35.583 --> 15:38.041
DOESN'T MEAN
I DON'T FEEL FOR HIM.

15:38.083 --> 15:40.959
SO YOU WANT HIM
TO PULL THE PLUG?

15:41.000 --> 15:44.041
HE'S SITTING THERE ALONE.
I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

15:44.083 --> 15:45.834
YEAH. OKAY.

15:45.875 --> 15:47.834
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

15:47.875 --> 15:50.333
I HAVE FEELINGS JUST LIKE
A REAL PERSON, SAM.

15:50.375 --> 15:52.959
HE'S ALONE. HE HAS TO
STARE THROUGH A WINDOW

15:53.000 --> 15:55.917
AT SOMEONE WHO JUST ISN'T
THERE ANYMORE.

15:55.959 --> 15:57.917
HE NEEDS IT TO BE OVER.
AT ANY COST?

15:57.959 --> 15:59.375
I'M NOT SAYING HE'S RIGHT.

15:59.417 --> 16:02.875
I'M SAYING
HE DESERVES TO BE HEARD.

16:12.375 --> 16:15.125
YOU'RE SAYING I NEED
TO KEEP LYING HERE.

16:15.166 --> 16:17.125
PROBABLY FOR ANOTHER
COUPLE OF DAYS.

16:17.166 --> 16:20.041
I'D LIKE TO COME BACK TOMORROW
AND RECHECK YOU IF THAT'S OKAY.

16:20.083 --> 16:23.750
WORST PART IS, I CAN'T EVEN
TAKE CARE OF MY KID.

16:23.792 --> 16:26.875
MEGAN, SHE'S 4.
SHE SHOULD BE HOME ANY MINUTE.

16:26.917 --> 16:29.375
I SENT HER TO SCHOOL
WITH A COUGH TODAY,

16:29.417 --> 16:31.208
'CAUSE IF SHE WAS HERE,
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN UP AND...

16:31.250 --> 16:34.792
SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH
THESE EYES, SAID SHE WAS FINE.

16:34.834 --> 16:36.792
YEAH, I KNOW THE LOOK.
YOU HAVE KIDS?

16:36.834 --> 16:39.041
A DAUGHTER, 8.

16:39.083 --> 16:42.375
(chuckles)
I THOUGHT I COULD
DO IT ALL, YOU KNOW--

16:42.417 --> 16:44.542
MOTHER, PROVIDER,
SUPER WOMAN.

16:44.583 --> 16:48.041
BUT NOW I'M LIKE
A SICK KID ON THE COUCH.

16:48.083 --> 16:50.375
I'M MOVING BACKWARDS.

16:50.417 --> 16:52.000
(door opens)

16:52.041 --> 16:54.917
BYE, EMMA. MOMMY!

16:54.959 --> 16:57.917
HEY! THANKS, DENA.
HI, PUMPKIN.

16:57.959 --> 16:59.291
OH.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.000
(coughs)

17:01.041 --> 17:02.959
OH, HEY, HEY, HEY.
(coughs)

17:03.000 --> 17:05.667
YOU KNOW, WHEN I COME BACK
TO CHECK YOU TOMORROW,

17:05.709 --> 17:09.166
I'LL--I'LL TRY AND ROPE IN
OUR PEDIATRICIAN, OKAY?
THANK YOU.

17:16.291 --> 17:19.041
OH. YOU'RE MISSING
SOME BUTTONS THERE, STUD MUFFIN.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.834
THEY'RE NOT MISSING.
OH, YOU LIKE GETTING
YOUR SHIRT RIPPED OFF?

17:21.875 --> 17:25.041
I CAN'T FIGHT YOU RIGHT NOW.
I HAVE TO SEE A PATIENT.
I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR A REMATCH.

17:25.083 --> 17:27.417
YOUR RELATIONSHIP'S
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

17:27.458 --> 17:29.834
YEAH, WELL, TO BE CLEAR,
IT'S NOT A RELATIONSHIP.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.375
IT'S JUST... SEX.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.041
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.667
NO NEED TO SHARE.

17:34.709 --> 17:37.041
SORRY. I DON'T MEAN
TO BE INSENSITIVE.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.041
I'M JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME.

17:39.083 --> 17:41.500
I'VE NEVER HAD
THIS MUCH OF A GOOD TIME

17:41.542 --> 17:43.291
WITH A WOMAN BEFORE.
(laughs)

17:43.333 --> 17:46.500
AGAIN, I'M OVERSHARING,
SO I'M JUST GONNA GO.

17:48.083 --> 17:49.834
WHAT?

17:49.875 --> 17:51.250
YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY?

17:51.291 --> 17:53.667
NO. NOTHING.

17:56.250 --> 17:59.583
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
A NEEDLE AND THREAD?

17:59.625 --> 18:02.583
MY SHIRT--SOME OF THE BUTTONS
JUST FELL OFF.
UH, YEAH.

18:02.625 --> 18:04.041
CHEAP SHIRT.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.709
(objects rattle)

18:05.750 --> 18:07.709
HERE YOU GO.

18:07.750 --> 18:08.959
THANKS.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.667
MM-HMM.

18:10.709 --> 18:13.750
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

18:13.792 --> 18:17.125
UH, NO.
YOU WANT SOMEONE
TO EAT CHOCOLATE WITH?

18:17.166 --> 18:20.041
ARE YOU TRYING TO BE FUNNY?
NO. I THINK
TALKING IS BETTER.

18:20.083 --> 18:22.959
BUT SINCE YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO TALK--

18:23.000 --> 18:26.959
I LIKE TO WORK WITHIN
SOMEONE'S COMFORT ZONE.
OH. WELL, OKAY.
UH, CHOCOLATE'S NOT HELPING.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.041
MUST BE BAD.
YEAH. (chuckles) YEAH.

18:29.083 --> 18:32.041
AND THE WORST PART IS,
THE PEOPLE I WOULD NORMALLY

18:32.083 --> 18:34.041
GO TO
TO TALK ABOUT IT, I CAN'T.

18:34.083 --> 18:37.041
SO...
WELL, YOU AND I
AREN'T THAT CLOSE,

18:37.083 --> 18:39.458
BUT MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.333
THANK YOU.

18:41.375 --> 18:43.583
ACTUALLY, MOST OF THE TIME,
IT'S CLOSED.

18:43.625 --> 18:46.333
MY CLIENTS
SEEM TO PREFER IT THAT WAY.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.375
(rattles box)
WELL, LOOK, SINCE YOU
DON'T WANT TO TALK,

18:49.417 --> 18:51.083
LET ME JUST ASK YOU THIS--

18:51.125 --> 18:53.083
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT MIGHT
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER?

18:53.125 --> 18:55.792
I MEAN, NOT TALKING,
NOT CHOCOLATE... (mutters)

18:55.834 --> 18:58.041
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
UM...

18:58.083 --> 19:00.542
WELL, I SEE SOMETHING.

19:00.583 --> 19:02.458
UM... IT'S FIFE.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.583
OH.
IT'S FIFE, OKAY?

19:04.625 --> 19:07.583
AND... (laughs) I-I-I DON'T
EVEN KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT HIM,

19:07.625 --> 19:10.375
BUT, UH, HE
KISSED ME YESTERDAY.

19:10.417 --> 19:13.041
AND, UH, WELL, YOU ASKED
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING

19:13.083 --> 19:16.000
THAT WOULD
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER--
SO GO WITH FEELING BETTER.

19:16.041 --> 19:18.000
I-I COULDN'T.
I WOULDN'T EVEN...

19:18.041 --> 19:20.000
I-I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I WANT, SO--

19:20.041 --> 19:22.041
WHAT, INTIMACY IS MORE WRONG
THAN CHOCOLATE?

19:22.083 --> 19:24.917
I MEAN, I THINK IF IT
MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER--
YEAH, BUT I-I WOULDN'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

19:24.959 --> 19:28.041
BECAUSE OF THE CHAIR?
UH, NO,
BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING.

19:28.083 --> 19:31.041
BUT, UH, YEAH, I-I GUESS
THE CHAIR DOES MAKE IT

19:31.083 --> 19:32.834
A LITTLE MORE CONFUSING.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.041
OH, GOD. THIS IS HUMILIATING.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK.

19:35.083 --> 19:37.041
TALKING IS NOT GOOD.

19:37.083 --> 19:40.041
OKAY, OKAY, I-I UNDERSTAND,
BUT IN TERMS OF THE CHAIR,

19:40.083 --> 19:42.834
THAT PARTICULAR IMPEDIMENT,
YOU SHOULD TALK TO CHARLOTTE.

19:42.875 --> 19:45.333
SHE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT SEX.
I CAN'T TALK TO CHARLOTTE.

19:45.375 --> 19:47.417
WE--NO, I-I TOOK HER JOB.

19:47.458 --> 19:49.375
WE HAVE A MUTUAL CONTEMPT.
I--

19:49.417 --> 19:51.375
BUT SHE KNOWS A LOT
ABOUT SEX--

19:51.417 --> 19:53.458
A LOT.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.875
(laughs)

19:54.917 --> 19:58.041
AND YOU DESERVE
TO FEEL BETTER.

19:58.083 --> 20:00.000
(whispers) SO... THANKS.

20:02.208 --> 20:06.041
(crying)
OKAY, LUCAS, I'M GONNA EXTRACT
SOME MUCUS FROM YOUR NOSE.

20:06.083 --> 20:08.250
YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
A SLIGHT PINCH,

20:08.291 --> 20:10.750
BUT THEN YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO BREATHE, OKAY?

20:10.792 --> 20:13.625
HERE WE GO. NO, LUCAS.
I NEED YOU TO STAY STILL. OKAY?
(continues crying)

20:13.667 --> 20:16.625
OH, GOSH. OKAY. WHEN YOU GROWN
UP, YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT THAT

20:16.667 --> 20:19.875
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF THINGS
THAT YOU CAN'T FIX, BUT THEN

20:19.917 --> 20:22.375
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
THAT YOU CAN FIX, LIKE THIS.

20:22.417 --> 20:24.792
AND IF YOU JUST LET ME, YOU'RE
GONNA FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

20:24.834 --> 20:27.041
OKAY? BUT I NEED YOU TO...
(continues crying)

20:27.083 --> 20:30.208
OH, LUCAS, I DON'T WANT TO KILL
YOU. I JUST WANT YOUR SNOT.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.834
(crying)
HE WON'T BE STILL.
HIS NOSE IS STUFFED UP,

20:32.875 --> 20:34.834
AND HE WON'T LET ME CLEAR IT.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.834

TO SUCK OUT HIS BRAIN.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.834
AND HE'S BEEN CRYING
SINCE I'VE BEEN ALIVE.

20:38.875 --> 20:41.709
COOPER, HOW DO PEOPLE DO THIS?
DID YOU REALLY BRING ME HERE
TO DO A BULB SYRINGE?

20:41.750 --> 20:43.083
YES.

A FRANTIC, FIRST-TIME PARENT?
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.041
WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE
AN ARROGANT

20:50.083 --> 20:51.667

DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS,

21:18.750 --> 21:21.083

SHE KNOWS HOW YOU FEEL,
EDDIE.
DOES SHE?

30:09.166 --> 30:11.125
DOES SHE UNDERSTAND
WHY I'M NOT THERE,

30:11.166 --> 30:14.125
WHY I'M NOT WITH HER?

30:14.166 --> 30:17.041
(footsteps approach)

30:17.083 --> 30:20.083
I TRIED
TALKING TO THE JUDGE.

30:20.125 --> 30:23.375
SHE WON'T CHANGE HER MIND.

30:32.375 --> 30:35.208
THIS IS GREAT INFORMATION.
USEFUL.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.333
YOU WERE NOT
SUPPOSED TO SEE THIS.

30:37.375 --> 30:39.500
I'M SO SORRY
THAT WAS ON MY DESK.

30:39.542 --> 30:42.125
I'M--I'M VERY, VERY SORRY.
AND I'M... REALLY HUMILIATED.

30:42.166 --> 30:45.291
CAN WE JUST PLEASE PRETEND
LIKE THIS NEVER HAPPENED?

30:45.333 --> 30:47.375
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I'VE NEVER BEEN PROPOSITIONED

30:47.417 --> 30:49.000
WITH EDUCATIONAL
LITERATURE BEFORE.

30:49.041 --> 30:51.709
IT'S KIND OF A TURN ON.

30:51.750 --> 30:55.083
NAOMI, IF YOU HAD QUESTIONS,
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST ASK ME?

30:55.125 --> 30:57.583
W-- (sighs) I WASN'T SURE
WHAT I WANTED.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.542
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT ANYTHING.

31:01.583 --> 31:04.041
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW YOU FEEL.

31:04.083 --> 31:07.041
BUT I CAN TELL YOU
HOW I FEEL.

31:07.083 --> 31:09.583
I LIKE YOU. I WANT YOU.

31:09.625 --> 31:12.458
I CAN HAVE SEX.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.417
AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,

31:14.458 --> 31:17.417
WE CAN TAKE A BOTTLE OF WINE
BACK TO MY PLACE,

31:17.458 --> 31:20.208
MAKE OUT LIKE TEENAGERS,
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

31:22.083 --> 31:23.542
IT HURTS.

31:23.583 --> 31:25.542
I KNOW.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

31:25.583 --> 31:27.041
(footsteps approach)

31:27.083 --> 31:28.834
SHE DIDN'T PICK UP.

31:28.875 --> 31:30.041
(groans)

31:30.083 --> 31:31.041
OKAY.

(sighs)

31:35.500 --> 31:37.250
OKAY.

31:37.291 --> 31:39.625
SO, UM...

31:39.667 --> 31:42.041
YEAH, UH... OKAY.

31:42.083 --> 31:45.792
I WANT YOU TO PRESS DOWN
JUST BELOW HER BELLY, HARD.

31:45.834 --> 31:48.500
AND I'LL FREE THE SHOULDER.
HOW?

31:48.542 --> 31:51.291
I'LL FORCE IT FREE.
YOU MIGHT BREAK
THE CLAVICLE.

31:51.333 --> 31:53.291
YEAH, THAT'S THE IDEA.
YOU'LL BREAK WHAT?

31:53.333 --> 31:55.041
YOU--YOU--

31:55.083 --> 31:57.709
YOU CAN'T BREAK MY BABY.
NO, NO,
NO, NO, SWEETIE. NO.

31:57.750 --> 32:01.041
DELL, YOU CAN'T INTENTIONALLY
FRACTURE A CLAVICLE.

32:01.083 --> 32:03.000
IT'S CRAZY.
YEAH, BUT IT'S A REAL THING.

32:03.041 --> 32:04.750
IT'S CALLED
A WOOD SCREW MANEUVER.

32:04.792 --> 32:07.125
NO, I-I KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED.
HAVE YOU EVER PERFORMED ONE?

32:07.166 --> 32:10.041
WELL, I'VE SEEN IT DONE. LOOK,
WE HAVE TO GET THE BABY OUT.

32:10.083 --> 32:12.542
YOU--YOU WANT
TO BREAK MY BABY?

32:12.583 --> 32:15.083
I WANT TO SAVE HIM.

32:15.125 --> 32:17.041
LET'S DO IT.

32:17.083 --> 32:19.750
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

32:19.792 --> 32:21.917
(clears throat)
LISTEN TO ME.

32:21.959 --> 32:24.333
EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE OKAY.

32:24.375 --> 32:27.750
YOUR BABY'S
GOING TO BE FINE.

32:27.792 --> 32:31.041
WHEN I TELL YOU TO PUSH,
I NEED YOU TO PUSH.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.083
