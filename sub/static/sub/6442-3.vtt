WEBVTT

00:11.401 --> 00:12.663
Plan on coming up for air?

00:12.836 --> 00:15.236
I'm thirsty. Is that a crime?

00:15.405 --> 00:18.431
-Come on, I'll give you a ride.
-I'm waiting for someone.

00:23.580 --> 00:24.842
Lana Lang.

00:25.015 --> 00:27.449
-Very original.
-I hear she's single again.

00:27.617 --> 00:29.812
They post that on her official
stalker website?

00:29.986 --> 00:31.248
I'm not stalking her.

00:31.421 --> 00:34.049
No, you just have her entire schedule
memorized for fun.

00:34.324 --> 00:36.588
That girl's got so many guys tailing her...

00:36.760 --> 00:39.194
...she should qualify
for Secret Service protection.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.239
Hi.

00:52.509 --> 00:53.976
Hi.

01:01.918 --> 01:03.408
Very smooth.

01:03.587 --> 01:08.047
Maybe in about 1 0 years you'll actually
be able to get a complete sentence out.

01:08.225 --> 01:10.022
I'll catch you later.

01:56.539 --> 01:58.200
Hello?

02:52.395 --> 02:55.387
Help! Help!

04:24.454 --> 04:28.015
Looks like you got yourself
a pinch hitter in the hero arena.

04:28.191 --> 04:30.625
I don't know if I'd call him a hero, Pete.

04:30.794 --> 04:32.386
I'm just glad Lana's okay.

04:32.562 --> 04:35.224
Yeah, I know. Have you seen her?

04:35.398 --> 04:38.799
I'm not exactly the person
Lana wants to be around right now.

04:40.170 --> 04:41.899
Keep it moving.

04:42.572 --> 04:44.972
I still can't believe
Jake turned Swimfan on Lana.

04:45.141 --> 04:47.837
Yeah, I didn't peg him as
a poolside-slasher type either.

04:48.011 --> 04:51.811
But I don't think Jake Pollen was exactly
like your average teenager.

04:53.650 --> 04:55.117
Why would you say that?

04:55.285 --> 04:58.721
Other than the meteor rock labeled "freak"
laid next to his body?

04:58.888 --> 05:01.584
You remember that field trip
we took down to Crater Lake...

05:01.758 --> 05:04.352
...the one where I dropped my keys
off of the pier?

05:04.527 --> 05:06.688
I thought you were gonna
call the Navy SEALs.

05:06.863 --> 05:09.832
-Jake fished them out.
-Right. He was underwater for six minutes.

05:09.999 --> 05:13.628
Unless you're David Blaine or a Himalayan
yoga master, that's impossible.

05:13.803 --> 05:17.603
-Hey, what's with the list?
-It's just my hunches, you know....

05:17.774 --> 05:19.674
Sort of anything that's off the charts.

05:19.843 --> 05:22.334
It's a purgatory before you get
to the Wall of Weird.

05:22.512 --> 05:24.207
You have a full file of Jake?

05:25.482 --> 05:28.781
I started suspecting a while ago
that he had amphibious abilities...

05:28.952 --> 05:31.113
...due to the meteor-rock exposure
for a while.

05:31.287 --> 05:33.949
You don't think you're stretching
with this one, Chloe?

05:34.123 --> 05:38.560
I don't think Jake is the mysterious one.
I mean, don't you think it's a little strange?

05:38.728 --> 05:42.687
Rifle-wielding commando shows up
right when Lana's getting attacked?

05:43.333 --> 05:46.200
If you wanna help track down
the enigmatic vigilante...

05:46.369 --> 05:49.361
...I would be willing to explore
the Jake angle.

05:52.809 --> 05:55.539
That would be assuming
I actually had a job here.

05:56.713 --> 06:01.514
Yeah-- It was never clear about
whose choice it was for you to quit.

06:03.119 --> 06:06.885
Look, Clark, I could say that I'm swamped
with the Daily Planet column...

06:07.056 --> 06:10.321
...but the truth is, it would just be
really nice to have you back.

06:22.839 --> 06:25.774
All right, doctor, I'll have Lex
stop by for an examination...

06:25.942 --> 06:28.467
...by the end of the week.

06:28.645 --> 06:32.376
All right. And Bob, thanks.

06:32.549 --> 06:33.811
Lex.

06:34.450 --> 06:36.577
Welcome back to LuthorCorp, son.

06:36.753 --> 06:39.017
Feels like I never left.

06:39.188 --> 06:42.487
You'll have the office next to mine.
You've got the river view.

06:42.659 --> 06:45.594
I appreciate the gesture,
but I'm not here to enjoy the scenery.

06:45.762 --> 06:50.222
-I'm here to generate profits.
-Lex, you already have the job.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.664
And now you've entered
the executive ranks...

06:52.835 --> 06:55.998
...you need to fill out
some paperwork. Coffee?

06:57.340 --> 06:58.705
I'm good.

07:01.511 --> 07:05.709
-Corporate life insurance?
-Standard for all upper-level employees.

07:06.549 --> 07:09.040
Is $50 million standard?

07:09.819 --> 07:12.788
Don't underestimate
your own value, my son.

07:15.425 --> 07:18.053
You seem reluctant, Lex.
I don't understand.

07:18.227 --> 07:20.252
It's hard not to consider
the implications...

07:20.430 --> 07:22.990
...when your mortality has a dollar sign
attached to it.

07:23.166 --> 07:29.002
Lex, I'd hoped we'd moved
beyond this distrust reflex of yours.

07:29.238 --> 07:34.335
-It's called common sense.
-No, you're a corporate asset, Lex.

07:34.510 --> 07:36.171
If something should happen to you...

07:36.346 --> 07:39.474
...the company needs to be
compensated for its loss.

07:41.451 --> 07:46.718
All right. That's unacceptable to you.
I understand.

07:46.889 --> 07:51.349
You can give your security card
to Nelson on your way out.

07:58.501 --> 08:00.731
Hey, Lana. How you doing?

08:00.903 --> 08:03.167
Hi. I haven't seen you in a while.

08:03.339 --> 08:05.398
I thought it might be easier that way.

08:05.575 --> 08:07.236
Easier on whom?

08:09.512 --> 08:13.380
I didn't come here to upset you.
I'm doing a story on Jake for the Torch.

08:14.384 --> 08:16.477
That's great, Clark.
What do you want to know?

08:16.653 --> 08:18.780
You told the police he had
a friend with him...

08:18.955 --> 08:21.253
...and I was wondering
if you could point him out.

08:27.430 --> 08:30.365
-I think that's him.
-Van McNulty. Thanks.

08:33.503 --> 08:35.403
Glad I could be of help.

08:35.571 --> 08:37.129
Lana.

08:42.779 --> 08:45.270
Is this on or off the record?

08:47.116 --> 08:48.845
I'm sorry I haven't stopped by.

08:51.020 --> 08:52.988
Clark, I know we're not
together anymore...

08:53.156 --> 08:56.284
...but you don't need an excuse
to come see me.

08:59.195 --> 09:02.596
Hey. So we can rule out
the Himalayan yoga masters.

09:02.765 --> 09:05.757
Check out what my connection
at the coroner's office gave me.

09:05.935 --> 09:09.098
You're not gonna see any of this
in Jake's official autopsy report.

09:10.673 --> 09:14.439
-Believe it or not, they're gills.
-That's disgusting.

09:14.610 --> 09:17.943
Personally, I find the gaping
bullet wound more disturbing.

09:18.815 --> 09:22.012
Okay, if that shooter hadn't shown up
when he did, I'd be dead.

09:22.185 --> 09:24.278
So forgive me if I don't have
more sympathy...

09:24.454 --> 09:26.945
...for the gill-boy
who tried to drown me.

09:27.590 --> 09:30.388
Jake was exposed to the meteor rocks.
He didn't ask for them.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.393
No, just like Greg Arkin didn't ask
to become a bug-boy...

09:33.563 --> 09:36.396
...and Tina Greer didn't ask
to become a bone-morpher.

09:36.566 --> 09:41.560
The fact is, when they got their powers,
they went psycho and tried to kill me.

09:41.738 --> 09:43.968
Tina even came back for seconds.

09:46.843 --> 09:48.970
Chloe's been attacked by more
of them than me.

09:49.145 --> 09:51.113
You remember Justin Gaines
and Sean Kelvin.

09:51.280 --> 09:55.876
Yeah. One tried to psychically impale me
with farm implements...

09:56.052 --> 09:59.453
...and the other just wanted my body heat.
Thanks for the memories.

09:59.622 --> 10:02.284
I'm just saying a shot in the head
is more extreme.

10:02.458 --> 10:05.052
What about the times that you
saved us from these people?

10:05.228 --> 10:07.287
What makes you so different
from the shooter?

10:07.463 --> 10:08.987
I've never killed anyone.

10:09.165 --> 10:13.465
Then how do you explain Tina Greer?
They found her body impaled in the alley.

10:13.636 --> 10:15.536
What happened to her, she did to herself.

10:15.705 --> 10:17.605
I was protecting you.

10:19.809 --> 10:22.277
Spoken like a true vigilante.

10:34.657 --> 10:36.921
Miss Sullivan. What a nice surprise.

10:37.093 --> 10:40.028
Have you brought me an addendum
to your report on Clark Kent?

10:40.196 --> 10:42.323
It's my final article for the Daily Planet.

10:42.498 --> 10:44.261
I'm turning in my resignation today.

10:46.302 --> 10:49.533
Our agreement is terminated.

10:49.705 --> 10:52.265
I'm sorry. Clark's friendship
just means too much to me.

10:52.441 --> 10:56.537
I can't say it's unexpected,
but it will be disappointing.

10:56.712 --> 11:00.978
I'm sorry. I guess some people are just
better at leading double lives than others.

11:01.784 --> 11:04.412
You misunderstand me, Miss Sullivan.

11:06.455 --> 11:08.650
I'm not the one who's
going to be disappointed.

11:08.825 --> 11:10.349
That'll be your father.

11:11.561 --> 11:13.756
What does he have to do with any of this?

11:13.930 --> 11:15.522
I guess he wanted to surprise you.

11:15.698 --> 11:18.565
But your father just made
a sizable down payment...

11:18.734 --> 11:21.134
...on a new house
overlooking the golf course.

11:23.105 --> 11:25.437
My dad still hasn't paid off
the new water heater.

11:25.608 --> 11:28.042
I seriously doubt he's moving us
to "brat flats."

11:28.211 --> 11:30.907
Well, it must be his way of celebrating
his new promotion.

11:31.080 --> 11:34.607
When I rewarded him for his hard work
and his dedication to LuthorCorp...

11:34.784 --> 11:37.651
...he was just brimming with pride.

11:39.655 --> 11:43.557
He'd be devastated if he suddenly
found himself unemployed.

11:44.961 --> 11:47.930
-You can't do this to him.
-Yes, I can.

11:48.130 --> 11:51.258
But I won't, which is why
I think we are going to enjoy...

11:51.434 --> 11:54.528
...a long and fruitful partnership,
Miss Sullivan.

12:03.579 --> 12:05.342
Van McNulty?

12:05.514 --> 12:07.379
-Hey.
-Clark Kent.

12:08.851 --> 12:11.183
I'm sorry to hear about your friend Jake.

12:11.354 --> 12:12.651
Thanks.

12:12.822 --> 12:16.656
He was always chasing girls, but I still
can't believe he attacked anybody.

12:21.330 --> 12:25.027
Police scanner. I just want to hear
when they catch Jake's killer.

12:26.469 --> 12:27.936
I'm doing a story for the Torch.

12:28.104 --> 12:30.902
I was wondering if you could give me
some background on Jake.

12:31.073 --> 12:33.041
Everything I know is in the police report.

12:38.881 --> 12:41.611
Never seen so many medals before.
Is that your dad?

12:43.386 --> 12:45.377
Must be a real hero.

12:45.922 --> 12:47.583
He was.

12:47.757 --> 12:49.247
And he was a great father.

12:49.425 --> 12:51.757
We used to do everything together.

12:57.934 --> 12:59.663
I'm gonna be late for class.

13:07.710 --> 13:10.679
Hey. Remember the rock that was tossed
next to Jake's body...

13:10.846 --> 13:14.407
...with the word "freak" written on it?
It wasn't the first the police found.

13:14.583 --> 13:18.417
Meet Leonard Wallace, local mechanic
gunned down two weeks ago.

13:18.587 --> 13:20.885
Someone put a similar rock
next to his body.

13:21.057 --> 13:22.581
Why do you think he was killed?

13:22.758 --> 13:25.784
I can't be sure, but last month,
when my VW Bug was in the shop...

13:25.962 --> 13:29.659
...I swear I saw his arm reach
for a wrench three feet under my car.

13:30.066 --> 13:34.002
I started a file on him just in case he had
some sort of stretching abilities.

13:34.170 --> 13:36.866
But unlike Jake,
Wallace never went psycho.

13:38.307 --> 13:40.673
So Lana's mystery hero isn't
out to save anyone.

13:40.843 --> 13:42.276
He's hunting them.

13:42.445 --> 13:44.879
Smallville's own version of a hate crime.

13:45.047 --> 13:46.571
But why?

13:48.584 --> 13:50.017
Revenge.

13:52.388 --> 13:57.052
Van McNulty's father was a Marine recruiter
who was killed by Tina Greer.

13:57.393 --> 14:00.658
Tina's dead, so he decides
to go Terminator on the rest.

14:02.465 --> 14:04.899
Van's fighting his own personal war.

14:08.371 --> 14:11.101
Clark, my definition of "hike"
stopped two miles ago.

14:11.273 --> 14:13.571
We have to get evidence for the police.

14:13.743 --> 14:16.177
He came here with his dad.
It'll just take a minute.

14:16.345 --> 14:19.075
Yeah, that's what you said
when we broke into his locker...

14:19.248 --> 14:21.239
...and his car and his house.

14:21.417 --> 14:23.385
Jake was killed by a hunting rifle.

14:23.552 --> 14:27.113
Like you can't find one of those
in the back window of every truck in town.

14:34.663 --> 14:37.723
Now, this place needs some
serious Lemon Pledge.

14:42.905 --> 14:45.897
All right, Clark, that's enough.
Let's go. There's nothing here.

14:48.044 --> 14:49.841
He's pretty tight with his dad.

14:50.012 --> 14:54.005
Clark, the last time I checked, there's
no offense in father and son bonding.

15:04.126 --> 15:06.026
Pete, there's a serious arsenal in here.

15:06.195 --> 15:09.426
Clark, it's a hunting cabin.
What do you expect?

15:42.331 --> 15:44.196
What's Lex Luthor's picture doing there?

15:44.400 --> 15:46.061
Pete, call the sheriff.

16:29.445 --> 16:31.003
Lex, get down!

16:33.215 --> 16:36.013
Someone's trying to kill him!
Get him inside!

16:36.185 --> 16:37.550
-Get on the perimeter.
-Go!

16:39.955 --> 16:41.252
Move it!

16:41.423 --> 16:42.822
Let's go!

17:08.050 --> 17:10.348
You're one of them.
I saw you catch that slug.

17:10.519 --> 17:12.384
It was in your hand.

17:12.555 --> 17:15.183
What are you,
some kind of bulletproof freak?

17:28.671 --> 17:30.036
What's wrong?

17:32.808 --> 17:34.833
Does this stuff make you sick
or something?

17:36.612 --> 17:40.981
Look at you. How about a nice big bite
of meteor rock?

17:41.817 --> 17:43.375
How's that feel?

18:10.079 --> 18:11.478
Lex.

18:12.281 --> 18:13.805
It's all right.

18:14.350 --> 18:15.783
Clark.

18:16.719 --> 18:18.880
How'd you know someone
was gonna try to kill me?

18:19.054 --> 18:21.181
It's the same person
who shot Lana's attacker.

18:21.357 --> 18:23.257
What would he want with me?

18:23.726 --> 18:26.661
Look, I know this is gonna sound bizarre,
but this kid Van...

18:26.829 --> 18:31.698
...he's convinced that the meteor rocks
in Smallville have altered certain people.

18:32.501 --> 18:34.435
What do you mean by "altered"?

18:34.603 --> 18:38.596
He thinks they've developed different
abilities than us, and he's hunting them.

18:39.675 --> 18:41.074
Lex, he had a hit list.

18:41.243 --> 18:43.336
They found it in his cabin,
and you're on it.

18:43.512 --> 18:46.879
My only abilities are playing the market
and falling for the wrong women.

18:47.049 --> 18:48.778
He's obviously crazy.

18:49.351 --> 18:51.842
There must be some reason he picked me.

18:53.322 --> 18:55.882
Think about it, Clark.
Lex survived the meteor shower...

18:56.058 --> 18:58.185
...a near-fatal car accident
and a plane crash.

18:58.360 --> 19:01.488
Even he doesn't have enough money
for a guardian angel like that.

19:01.664 --> 19:03.461
Check this out.

19:04.600 --> 19:08.366
His medical records show he has a
white-blood-cell count that is off the charts.

19:08.537 --> 19:12.940
-It's more than enough to raise an eyebrow.
-You've been keeping a file on Lex too.

19:13.108 --> 19:15.770
Didn't you learn your lesson
about keeping secret files?

19:15.944 --> 19:19.107
They're my own private notes.
Since when is curiosity a crime?

19:19.281 --> 19:22.910
Since someone took your database
and turned it into a personal hit list.

19:23.085 --> 19:26.316
Van had a printout of the same file
on his bulletin board.

19:29.792 --> 19:32.056
Van helped network half these computers.

19:32.428 --> 19:34.123
He must have cracked my password.

19:36.231 --> 19:38.028
Oh, God, Clark.

19:38.901 --> 19:40.766
This is all my fault.

19:42.671 --> 19:45.003
Chloe, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to blame you.

19:45.174 --> 19:47.870
-It's not like you pulled the trigger.
-No.

19:48.043 --> 19:51.342
I just loaded the gun and pointed it
in the right direction.

19:56.352 --> 19:57.944
Where is he?

19:58.120 --> 20:01.578
Lex. Thank God you're all right.

20:01.757 --> 20:04.817
You're now covered
by my personal security.

20:04.993 --> 20:06.392
I appreciate the gesture...

20:06.562 --> 20:09.588
...but I'm not gonna let some
adolescent assassin disrupt my life.

20:09.765 --> 20:12.825
Don't take that cavalier attitude, Lex.

20:13.068 --> 20:17.232
I wouldn't worry about it, Dad.
I'm insured now.

20:18.140 --> 20:23.510
Not yet. There's some difficulty getting
you underwritten by Lloyd's of London.

20:26.115 --> 20:27.980
On what grounds?

20:28.150 --> 20:31.278
Your tendency to attract
near-death experiences...

20:31.453 --> 20:33.887
...has made you too great a liability.

20:35.858 --> 20:38.190
I would think surviving would
count for something.

20:38.360 --> 20:41.488
You're right. I'll get it straightened out.
Don't worry.

20:42.364 --> 20:43.831
Dad.

20:45.033 --> 20:47.593
Before the meteor shower...

20:48.437 --> 20:49.768
...was I ever sick?

20:51.073 --> 20:56.807
When you were a child, you had asthma.
But other than that, no.

20:56.979 --> 20:58.810
Nothing serious.

21:03.218 --> 21:07.348
Don't you find it a little strange...

21:07.523 --> 21:10.788
...that I've never been sick
a day in my life since?

21:11.560 --> 21:13.255
What's all this about, Lex?

21:16.131 --> 21:17.598
Nothing.

21:18.801 --> 21:21.668
I obviously inherited strong genes.

21:34.049 --> 21:36.313
Sheriff Adams, have you found Van yet?

21:36.485 --> 21:39.613
We're looking, but there's no reason
to think he's come back here.

21:39.788 --> 21:43.019
I think there is. Take a look at this.

21:44.693 --> 21:47.560
One of these people
will be Van's next target.

21:47.729 --> 21:49.629
Are we in the psychic business now?

21:49.798 --> 21:52.198
Just look at the first three names.

21:54.036 --> 21:56.004
Where'd you get this?

21:57.272 --> 21:59.035
A friend who believes these people...

21:59.208 --> 22:02.609
...are linked to a certain
phenomena in Smallville.

22:02.811 --> 22:04.676
A phenomena, huh?

22:05.747 --> 22:10.047
-It's a little out of my jurisdiction.
-Well, you don't have to believe it's true.

22:10.352 --> 22:13.617
Van McNulty does, and these people are
in a lot of danger.

22:15.457 --> 22:17.391
Can't hurt to be cautious.

22:21.530 --> 22:23.293
How's Lex doing?

22:23.899 --> 22:26.026
Okay. I guess.

22:26.201 --> 22:28.692
It's not the first time
he's been in the cross hairs.

22:28.871 --> 22:31.931
-Are they sure Van was the shooter?
-I am.

22:34.943 --> 22:38.504
Lana, I know he saved your life,
but I don't think that was his intention.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.648
No, it was just a happy accident.

22:41.817 --> 22:44.047
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

22:44.953 --> 22:48.218
Clark, I really thought I was going to die.

22:49.558 --> 22:51.423
You've been through worse.

22:51.593 --> 22:55.689
Because you've been there to protect me.
But I knew you weren't coming this time...

22:55.864 --> 22:59.698
...so when Van showed up, I was relieved
that there were others like you out there.

22:59.868 --> 23:01.733
He's not like me.

23:01.904 --> 23:04.202
You have to see him for what he is.
He's a killer.

23:04.773 --> 23:07.708
Lana, it's okay to be mad at people
who tried to hurt you.

23:07.876 --> 23:11.312
But it's not fair to take it out on everyone
affected by the meteors.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.711
It's not their fault.
No one asked to be different.

23:16.818 --> 23:19.912
Life would just be so much better
for everybody...

23:20.088 --> 23:23.057
...if the meteor shower never happened.

23:29.765 --> 23:34.600
1 97, 1 98, 1 99.

25:28.750 --> 25:31.048
I've searched everywhere
from here to Metropolis.

25:31.219 --> 25:32.481
It's like Van disappeared.

25:32.654 --> 25:34.849
Clark, he can't hide forever.

25:35.023 --> 25:38.618
Every police officer in the state's
looking for him. They'll find him.

25:38.794 --> 25:41.558
I just hope he doesn't find
his next target first.

25:43.365 --> 25:45.595
Dad, do you think I'm like Van?

25:46.902 --> 25:49.632
Well, I think you know my answer
to that question, son.

25:49.805 --> 25:52.296
The real question is,
do you think you're like Van?

25:52.474 --> 25:56.376
It's just, I've come into contact with
a lot of kryptonite-infected people...

25:58.180 --> 26:01.343
...and it never ends with us
being friends or shaking hands.

26:01.516 --> 26:04.076
I gave Lana this whole tolerance speech.

26:04.252 --> 26:06.243
I always assume the worst
about them too.

26:14.229 --> 26:17.164
There could be lots of people out there
who've been infected...

26:17.332 --> 26:19.425
...who lead perfectly normal lives.

26:20.402 --> 26:22.393
They're forced to live with their secret.

26:22.571 --> 26:25.404
And they could be using
their abilities for good too.

26:25.574 --> 26:27.804
I'm gonna get cleaned up.

27:06.915 --> 27:08.177
Clark?

27:09.217 --> 27:10.479
Clark!

27:15.757 --> 27:17.384
-Dad.
-Clark.

27:17.826 --> 27:20.420
I got you.

27:20.595 --> 27:22.654
Help!

27:25.901 --> 27:28.699
-How's that coming, sweetheart?
-I got it.

27:31.106 --> 27:32.505
It's okay.

27:32.674 --> 27:34.232
It's all right. Hang in there.

27:34.409 --> 27:36.343
It's okay. It's all right.

27:36.511 --> 27:40.345
He's dying. The poison is
spreading so fast.

27:40.515 --> 27:44.144
Okay, Clark, I'm gonna....
I'm gonna get it out.

27:45.353 --> 27:47.287
Clark, you gotta stay still, son.

27:47.455 --> 27:49.685
Hold on, baby. Hold on.
Dad's gonna get it.

27:50.258 --> 27:52.453
My God. He's not breathing.

27:52.627 --> 27:54.822
All right, hand me those.

28:00.435 --> 28:02.926
Don't you give up on us now, son.

28:06.107 --> 28:07.734
Do you have it?

28:07.909 --> 28:09.900
Martha, it's in there so far.

28:11.112 --> 28:14.343
Wait a second. I think I got it.

28:14.716 --> 28:17.651
-Okay.
-Hold on, baby. He's got it.

28:30.532 --> 28:32.397
Get that thing out of here.

28:34.269 --> 28:36.169
Clark. Come on, son.

28:39.574 --> 28:41.439
Come on, Clark.

29:58.553 --> 29:59.884
Lana.

30:01.489 --> 30:03.150
It's me. Van.

30:03.325 --> 30:05.816
-I'm the one who saved you.
-Yeah, I know who you are.

30:06.861 --> 30:10.456
They've got the roads blocked off,
and they're casing my house and my cabin.

30:10.632 --> 30:12.725
I need you to help me get out of here.

30:13.535 --> 30:16.834
-Van, I think you should turn yourself in.
-To the police?

30:17.005 --> 30:19.974
They're useless. I'm mean,
they should be protecting us.

30:20.608 --> 30:22.473
I thought you'd understand.

30:22.644 --> 30:25.374
You owe me, Lana. I saved your life.

30:25.547 --> 30:27.105
I know.

30:27.449 --> 30:29.747
But Lex didn't do anything to you.

30:29.918 --> 30:31.943
I'm sorry about what happened
to your father.

30:32.120 --> 30:34.748
But going after innocent people
won't bring him back.

30:34.923 --> 30:36.447
These freaks aren't people, Lana.

30:36.624 --> 30:39.286
No matter how much they seem like it.
Look at Jake.

30:39.461 --> 30:43.761
All right, he was best friend for three years,
and I had no idea.

30:45.133 --> 30:48.762
-And you're being fooled just like I was.
-What do you mean?

30:48.937 --> 30:51.804
Clark Kent is one of them.

30:54.342 --> 30:57.709
-Why would you say that?
-I know he seemed perfectly normal...

30:57.879 --> 31:01.042
...but I saw him catch a bullet, Lana.
In his bare hands.

31:01.983 --> 31:04.508
He was a freak just like the rest of them.

31:06.087 --> 31:07.987
What do you mean, "was"?

31:09.791 --> 31:13.386
Well, let's just say Clark Kent
won't be able to hurt anyone now.

31:16.164 --> 31:18.997
-What did you do?
-I found his weakness.

31:19.801 --> 31:22.065
I made special bullets.

31:24.606 --> 31:25.903
No.

31:26.074 --> 31:28.907
That freak got exactly what he deserved.

31:30.612 --> 31:33.706
Clark is more human
than you will ever be.

31:45.627 --> 31:49.085
Get someone to the Kent farm, quick.
Clark Kent's been murdered.

31:50.598 --> 31:53.328
You were in love with that
disgusting mutant, weren't you?

31:53.501 --> 31:56.368
You know, there's only one thing
I hate worse than a freak...

31:56.538 --> 31:58.130
...and that's a freak-lover.

32:03.311 --> 32:05.142
He's coming to.

32:08.550 --> 32:10.279
Clark, how you feeling, son?

32:10.452 --> 32:12.477
-A little woozy.
-Well, you need to lie down.

32:12.654 --> 32:15.179
-Take it slowly.
-No, I need to find Van.

32:15.356 --> 32:17.950
Your wound may be healed,
but you still need to rest.

32:18.126 --> 32:21.459
How can I rest knowing that Van's
out there with a hit list in his hand?

32:21.629 --> 32:25.258
Clark, this boy is not like the others.
He has kryptonite bullets.

32:25.433 --> 32:27.298
He already tried to kill you once, son.

32:27.469 --> 32:31.337
-I'll not let you give him a second chance.
-I know what I'm up against now.

32:36.478 --> 32:38.969
Mrs. Kent, is Clark all right?

32:40.248 --> 32:42.682
Yeah, Clark's fine. Why, sheriff?

32:45.887 --> 32:49.789
Well, rumors of your death have
been greatly exaggerated, Mr. Kent.

32:56.464 --> 32:58.295
Are you sure everything's all right?

32:58.833 --> 33:00.801
Oh, yeah. It was a barbed-wire accident.

33:03.538 --> 33:08.202
-What do you mean, rumors of my death?
-Dispatch got a call you'd been murdered.

33:10.979 --> 33:14.244
-Who'd make a call like that?
-Beats heck out of me.

33:14.849 --> 33:18.046
I don't appreciate crank calls,
especially in the middle of a manhunt.

33:18.219 --> 33:20.016
-All clear at the Kent farm.
-Roger.

33:20.188 --> 33:21.780
Over.

33:26.494 --> 33:28.223
Where's your son?

33:33.868 --> 33:36.530
Van, I know you're listening.
You didn't get me.

33:36.704 --> 33:39.798
If you want to finish this, meet me
where I saw your dad's picture.

33:39.974 --> 33:41.305
I'm on my way

33:49.050 --> 33:51.211
I don't know how he survived
my first shot...

33:51.386 --> 33:54.048
...but we're gonna see
how he handles a whole clip.

34:10.205 --> 34:14.301
You may have survived one bullet,
but I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

34:14.475 --> 34:16.204
Lana. Let her go!

34:16.610 --> 34:20.570
Not until she sees once and for all
that her lover-boy is a freak show.

34:30.358 --> 34:31.757
Clark!

34:43.905 --> 34:45.496
I told you he was a freak.

34:49.844 --> 34:51.505
You're the freak.

34:58.786 --> 35:00.549
Clark, how did you...?

35:02.790 --> 35:05.020
It's all about dressing for the occasion.

35:10.265 --> 35:12.790
What is that? Lead?

35:25.680 --> 35:27.705
You can rest a bit easier.

35:27.882 --> 35:29.941
Van McNulty's been taken into custody.

35:30.118 --> 35:31.676
He's in the psychiatric ward.

35:33.855 --> 35:37.723
I knew Van was misguided,
but I'm not so sure he's insane.

35:38.559 --> 35:40.618
What makes you say that?

35:42.030 --> 35:43.930
Churchill once said¡G

35:44.832 --> 35:49.030
"Out of intense complexities,
intense simplicities emerge."

35:50.638 --> 35:53.004
Maybe that kid was right about me.

35:53.741 --> 35:57.507
-Lex, he's a fanatic.
-Oh, but Chloe Sullivan's not?

35:59.213 --> 36:01.738
How many times have I come
face to face with death...

36:01.916 --> 36:05.408
...and walked away without a scratch?
I've practically lost count.

36:06.421 --> 36:08.685
Weirder things have happened.

36:09.624 --> 36:12.821
I thought the reason I survived
that Porsche accident...

36:12.994 --> 36:15.087
...was because of you, Clark.

36:15.596 --> 36:17.621
Now I'm not so sure.

36:17.999 --> 36:21.958
See, I've always tried to explain everything
by looking outside myself.

36:23.438 --> 36:26.999
But maybe the truth lies
inside my own physiology.

36:29.043 --> 36:30.908
Maybe I am a freak.

36:45.793 --> 36:47.385
Hey, Lana, is everything okay?

36:47.562 --> 36:50.122
I thought we established that
we didn't need a reason...

36:50.298 --> 36:52.061
...to come and see each other.

36:54.102 --> 36:57.833
I didn't get a chance to tell you,
but you really kicked ass yesterday.

36:58.740 --> 37:01.436
Yeah, well, some hero I turned out to be.

37:01.776 --> 37:03.676
You still got shot.

37:07.582 --> 37:09.914
You must be pretty sore.

37:14.122 --> 37:15.885
It still stings a little.

37:20.928 --> 37:23.158
You know...

37:23.564 --> 37:27.591
...I believed Van for a minute
when he told me you were bulletproof.

37:28.035 --> 37:29.366
Is that what he told you?

37:31.139 --> 37:33.937
It was really comforting to hear.

37:34.108 --> 37:36.906
Suddenly, everything made sense.

37:37.078 --> 37:38.409
The tornado.

37:38.579 --> 37:40.672
All the times that you've been there.

37:40.848 --> 37:43.783
Everything I can't explain.

37:49.390 --> 37:52.086
I wish the answer was that easy.

37:52.260 --> 37:55.058
But I wasn't infected by the meteor rocks.

37:58.032 --> 37:59.897
If you were...

38:00.968 --> 38:02.993
...it would be okay.

38:11.913 --> 38:13.938
I have to get back to work.

38:17.618 --> 38:21.987
What I don't understand is
you're willing to walk into bullets for me...

38:22.156 --> 38:24.716
...but you won't share
what's going on inside.

38:30.665 --> 38:35.830
Clark, if you don't open up to the people
that love you, you'll always be alone.

38:36.003 --> 38:39.336
I can't believe you want
to spend your life like that.

38:42.643 --> 38:45.077
I may not have a choice.

38:47.448 --> 38:49.678
You always have a choice.

39:22.250 --> 39:25.185
You hit a glitch, Miss Sullivan?

39:25.353 --> 39:28.345
I know a very capable
computer technician...

39:28.523 --> 39:30.957
...who might have some familiarity
with your setup.

39:31.425 --> 39:33.222
How could I be so idiotic?

39:33.394 --> 39:36.921
You donate the computers and then
send your experts in to set them up.

39:37.098 --> 39:40.499
Yeah, philanthropy.
I've always prided myself on that.

39:40.668 --> 39:43.796
What about tampering with a high school
student's personal computer?

39:43.971 --> 39:47.372
I think you'll find
your personal computer is on loan...

39:47.542 --> 39:51.376
...to the school as the property
of the LuthorCorp Foundation.

39:51.846 --> 39:53.973
You are so low, you're subterranean.

39:54.148 --> 39:58.050
Clark's files aren't on this hard drive.
Do you really think I'd be that stupid?

39:58.219 --> 40:01.052
My interest doesn't end with Clark Kent.

40:01.222 --> 40:04.248
I'm intrigued by your whole body of work.

40:05.059 --> 40:09.325
I hate to see your valuable research
evaporate into the ether...

40:09.497 --> 40:13.433
...but I will not allow information that
concerns my son to be made available...

40:13.601 --> 40:17.697
...to anyone who can hack their way
into your personal files.

40:17.972 --> 40:20.770
Mr. Luthor, I'm very sorry
about what happened to Lex.

40:20.942 --> 40:24.742
These files were never meant to be
seen by anyone other than me.

40:25.546 --> 40:27.309
I warn you...

40:27.481 --> 40:31.941
...if I ever catch you investigating
a member of my family again...

40:32.553 --> 40:36.284
...a computer glitch will be
the least of your problems.

40:41.696 --> 40:43.061
Good night, Miss Sullivan.

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
