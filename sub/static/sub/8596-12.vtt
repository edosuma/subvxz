WEBVTT

00:00.877 --> 00:03.004
Previously on "The 100"...

00:03.213 --> 00:05.423
I am the last
Natblida,

00:05.632 --> 00:07.717
heir to Bekka Pramheda,

00:07.926 --> 00:09.594
and you
are my subjects.

00:09.803 --> 00:11.388
We need to increase
the population

00:11.596 --> 00:12.931
in the city of light.

00:13.139 --> 00:14.766
The more minds
turned to the task,

00:14.975 --> 00:16.977
the more powerful
Alie becomes.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.269
Jaha has been
chipping everyone.

00:18.478 --> 00:19.396
Jasper's right.

00:19.604 --> 00:21.731
I've seen it
with my own eyes.

00:21.940 --> 00:24.234
Now that Arkadia
has fallen,

00:24.442 --> 00:26.945
we'll move on
to stage two.

00:27.153 --> 00:28.029
Uh!

00:28.238 --> 00:30.448
What
are you doing? Stop!

00:35.996 --> 00:37.163
Raven--

00:37.372 --> 00:39.833
you know too much.
I can't let them have you.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.209
- Uh! Ah!
- Raven--

00:41.418 --> 00:43.044
why did Alie want you
to kill yourself?

00:43.253 --> 00:45.171
Because I know why
she wants the second a.I.

00:45.380 --> 00:46.423
Why?

00:46.631 --> 00:49.426
It's the only thing
that can stop her.

00:51.553 --> 00:53.096
You ever hear the one
about the massacre

00:53.304 --> 00:54.180
on Alpha station?

00:54.389 --> 00:55.473
- No.
- No?

00:55.682 --> 00:57.976
- No.
- You?

00:58.184 --> 00:59.811
- Hey.
- Ha ha!

01:00.020 --> 01:01.688
Well, listen.

01:01.896 --> 01:04.190
It--it wasn't long
after unity day, right?

01:04.399 --> 01:05.650
Generation one,
they didn't know

01:05.859 --> 01:07.986
that they were leaving
the ground forever.

01:08.194 --> 01:09.904
Some of them
lost their minds.

01:10.071 --> 01:13.491
Not listening,
OK?

01:13.700 --> 01:14.701
We got to meet the
others in 6 hours.

01:14.909 --> 01:17.037
I need sleep.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.621
Oh, he hates
ghost stories.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.331
Well, I want
to hear it,

01:20.540 --> 01:21.624
so come on, Miller.

01:21.833 --> 01:24.002
Scare me.

01:24.210 --> 01:26.129
All right.

01:26.337 --> 01:29.132
There's
this one guy--

01:29.340 --> 01:32.218
Brazilian,
Captain Fidalgo.

01:32.427 --> 01:34.345
That was his name.

01:34.554 --> 01:35.680
He started to see
his dead wife

01:35.889 --> 01:37.640
and kids
in his dreams.

01:37.849 --> 01:41.352
They were all burned up
from the bombs.

01:41.561 --> 01:44.022
He told
the ship's doc

01:44.230 --> 01:45.482
that they looked
like demons.

01:47.025 --> 01:48.693
After a while,
he started

01:48.902 --> 01:51.571
to see them when
he was awake, too.

01:51.780 --> 01:53.239
He would beg and beg
and beg them

01:53.448 --> 01:56.451
to leave him alone,
just to stop, right?

01:56.659 --> 01:59.037
They said the only way
they'd leave him alone

01:59.245 --> 02:00.914
was if he did
one thing.

02:01.122 --> 02:03.166
- Uh-huh.
- What?

02:03.374 --> 02:05.251
Kill.

02:05.460 --> 02:07.545
Well, like
demons do.

02:07.754 --> 02:11.007
Yeah.
Like demons do.

02:11.216 --> 02:14.094
His weapon of choice--
metal hook.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.012
Mm.

02:16.221 --> 02:17.597
- A hook?
- Mm-hmm.

02:17.806 --> 02:19.224
That's the best
you can do?

02:19.432 --> 02:20.558
Shut up, Bryan.
Let him tell it.

02:20.767 --> 02:23.978
So he murdered 11 people
in one night.

02:24.187 --> 02:27.107
He gutted them
and strung them up in the mess.

02:27.315 --> 02:30.443
Worst part of it,
when the guards found him,

02:30.652 --> 02:33.530
he was cut
into pieces, too.

02:33.738 --> 02:36.741
He wrote a single word
with his own blood on the floor

02:36.950 --> 02:40.328
with the arm that
he didn't hack off--"demons."

02:41.913 --> 02:44.165
Pbbb...God,
I hate you.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.920
Anyway, you know
that, uh--

02:49.129 --> 02:52.048
that scraping sound we hear
at Alpha station sometimes?

02:52.257 --> 02:54.342
Some say that's
Fidalgo's ghost

02:54.551 --> 02:57.929
dragging his metal hook
along the walls,

02:58.138 --> 03:00.723
begging the demons
to stop,

03:00.932 --> 03:03.268
but they never do,

03:03.476 --> 03:05.436
and he's back

03:05.645 --> 03:07.272
looking
for his next victim!

03:07.480 --> 03:10.441
- Oh!
- Ha ha ha!

03:12.360 --> 03:13.611
Ha ha!

03:13.820 --> 03:16.406
Anyway, uh,
nature calls.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.783
Listen for that hook,
right?

03:21.452 --> 03:23.037
Look. Relax, Bryan.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.165
No demons out there,
just grounders

03:25.373 --> 03:27.750
who didn't hear
the blockade was lifted.

03:27.959 --> 03:30.128
Army of chipped
Arkadians.

03:30.336 --> 03:31.296
Uh!

03:37.927 --> 03:41.389
Don't look at me.
He's your boyfriend.

03:41.598 --> 03:43.308
Oh, yeah.

03:43.516 --> 03:45.560
Kick my boyfriend's ass.

03:45.768 --> 03:47.937
Good luck.

03:52.567 --> 03:54.694
Hey, when you guys
find Captain Fidalgo,

03:54.903 --> 03:57.572
get him to chop up
some more firewood, OK?

03:57.780 --> 03:59.282
Heh.

04:05.455 --> 04:07.916
Oh, seriously,
"a" for effort, Miller.

04:13.630 --> 04:15.381
Guys?

04:22.889 --> 04:25.058
Bryan.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.728
Guys, this isn't
funny anymore.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.357
Miller.

04:44.244 --> 04:46.788
Got me.

04:46.955 --> 04:49.624
You're hilarious.
You can come back now.

04:51.834 --> 04:54.420
Aah!

05:24.951 --> 05:26.452
He--Heda.

05:26.661 --> 05:29.163
- Heda.
- For Heda.

05:31.916 --> 05:33.751
Heda!

05:35.670 --> 05:37.797
Heda.

05:38.006 --> 05:41.467
Hey, stranger,
care for a bite?

05:44.137 --> 05:46.723
Emori, what the hell
are you doing here?

05:46.931 --> 05:48.891
Cooking rats.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.768
The old vendor was
brutally attacked

05:50.977 --> 05:52.478
on the road.

05:52.687 --> 05:54.731
It's dangerous
out there.

05:54.939 --> 05:57.317
Yeah.
Clearly, it is.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.818
I have been
looking for you

05:59.027 --> 06:00.278
ever since
you were taken,

06:00.486 --> 06:03.031
and then I heard rumors
of the new Heda's

06:03.239 --> 06:05.616
handsome Skaikru
flame keeper.

06:05.825 --> 06:08.494
I knew it had
to be you.

06:08.703 --> 06:10.747
I taught you well.

06:10.955 --> 06:12.874
She's one hell
of a mark, John.

06:13.082 --> 06:14.584
I want in.

06:16.627 --> 06:19.172
Uh, love one.
Thank you.

06:21.549 --> 06:22.967
Mm, it's the best.

06:23.176 --> 06:25.553
It's the best rat
I've ever had.

06:25.762 --> 06:29.223
Do not fall
behind again.

06:33.144 --> 06:34.854
Keep following
this street,

06:35.063 --> 06:37.440
alley on the left,
black door halfway down.

06:37.648 --> 06:39.692
I'll get away
as soon as I can.

06:45.490 --> 06:48.868
Becca's journal
is amazing.

06:49.077 --> 06:53.456
At 26, she found a pathway
to access a human mind.

06:55.083 --> 06:56.542
That same year, she
had to lock up Alie

06:56.751 --> 06:57.960
because her answer
for what was wrong

06:58.169 --> 07:00.505
with the world
was too many people.

07:00.713 --> 07:03.841
She was 27 when it
launched the bombs.

07:04.050 --> 07:05.802
What did she write
about the flame?

07:06.010 --> 07:07.095
Alie 2.0.

07:07.303 --> 07:09.055
She saw it as a way
to atone for her sins.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.516
She designed it to not
just access a human mind,

07:11.724 --> 07:13.893
but to merge with one.

07:14.102 --> 07:16.979
It could never wipe us out
because it would be one of us.

07:17.188 --> 07:18.940
She would put it
in herself first,

07:19.148 --> 07:22.402
altered her genes so her body
wouldn't reject the implant.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.947
Bekka Pramheda,
the first commander.

07:26.155 --> 07:28.866
The gene therapy made
her blood black, didn't it?

07:29.075 --> 07:31.619
- Yeah.
- How did you know that?

07:31.828 --> 07:33.329
Nightblood.

07:33.538 --> 07:34.872
That's where
it came from.

07:35.081 --> 07:37.250
Somehow it became
hereditary.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.626
Luna has it.

07:38.793 --> 07:41.045
That's why we
have to find her.

07:41.254 --> 07:43.047
If she can access
Alie 2--

07:43.256 --> 07:45.383
she can tell us
how to stop Alie 1.

07:46.509 --> 07:47.885
Bekka Pramheda gets

07:48.094 --> 07:49.387
her second shot
at atonement.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.597
Get back
to the mind pathway.

07:51.806 --> 07:53.724
If Alie uses it to
upload our minds

07:53.933 --> 07:56.018
to the city
of light,

07:56.227 --> 07:58.813
then there's a chance
my mom's still alive.

07:59.021 --> 08:02.233
That depends on your
definition of "alive."

08:05.862 --> 08:08.364
Eyes sharp.
Weapons hot.

08:08.573 --> 08:10.116
We're almost home.

08:13.578 --> 08:15.163
Miller, come in.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.167
Harper, you there?

08:19.375 --> 08:21.544
Ride's
two minutes out.

08:24.714 --> 08:27.008
Good start.

08:30.636 --> 08:33.306
We left
two days ago.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.725
Why haven't they
fixed the gate?

08:35.933 --> 08:38.686
Maybe because there's
no one here to fix it.

08:38.853 --> 08:41.355
It's like
a ghost town.

08:43.733 --> 08:46.777
Miller, where
the hell are you?

08:46.986 --> 08:48.321
I don't
like this.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.531
Maybe they got chipped.

08:50.740 --> 08:52.158
If they
got chipped,

08:52.366 --> 08:54.452
they'd have been waiting
for us at the cave.

08:54.660 --> 08:55.995
Maybe they saw
the open gate,

08:56.204 --> 08:57.455
went in
for Lincoln's book.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.415
Maybe you should
stop saying "maybe."

08:59.624 --> 09:02.460
If they are chipped,
Alie already knows we're coming.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.396
Let's get his book and
get the hell out of here.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.524
That's a plan
I can support.

09:30.029 --> 09:32.031
Lincoln.

09:48.548 --> 09:50.383
Close it up.
Turn the rover around.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.385
We may need to get
out of here quickly.

10:08.734 --> 10:11.237
Looks like they just
got up and walked away.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.072
We're
in and out.

10:13.281 --> 10:14.615
Pack as much
gear as you can

10:14.824 --> 10:15.866
into the rover.

10:16.075 --> 10:17.577
I'll get the map.

10:17.785 --> 10:20.371
I'll, uh, go with her.
No one should be alone.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.206
You don't want
to load gear, huh?

10:22.415 --> 10:23.874
Not even a little.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.002
What's the rush?
They won't be coming back.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.795
How do you know?

10:28.004 --> 10:30.006
Alie's mission
is to chip everyone.

10:30.214 --> 10:31.841
It wouldn't make sense
to return to a place

10:32.049 --> 10:33.718
she already took.

10:33.926 --> 10:36.053
Might make sense if there were
someone in that place--

10:36.262 --> 10:39.140
I.E., you--who could
tell us stuff like that.

10:39.348 --> 10:43.644
Good point.
Let's load gear.

11:09.295 --> 11:11.839
G'ah!

11:12.048 --> 11:13.507
Uh...

11:15.301 --> 11:18.054
- Hey...
- What?

11:19.513 --> 11:23.309
Remember when you told
me it--it gets better?

11:23.517 --> 11:26.479
This is not
the same thing.

11:26.687 --> 11:29.523
You know, it's OK to fall
apart a little, Octavia.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.360
You loved him.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.367
A warrior doesn't
mourn the dead

11:39.575 --> 11:42.953
until the war
is over.

11:43.162 --> 11:46.707
I'll wait in the hall.

12:19.073 --> 12:22.243
Luna, we're on our way.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.497
Uh...

12:28.708 --> 12:30.167
Grounder.

12:30.376 --> 12:31.544
Uh!

12:31.752 --> 12:32.670
Jasper--

12:33.879 --> 12:36.298
uh! Ugh...

12:36.507 --> 12:37.925
Ugh...

12:53.649 --> 12:56.485
Ready to prove how
much you miss me?

13:18.382 --> 13:20.801
I recognize
some of this tech.

13:21.010 --> 13:22.845
Oh, let me
guess.

13:23.053 --> 13:26.390
Flame keeper was one
of your customers?

13:29.435 --> 13:31.312
Who is this?

13:33.355 --> 13:36.776
They, uh, call her
Bekka Pramheda.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.487
She was the first
commander.

13:40.821 --> 13:41.864
Becca.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.075
Come on. Don't tell
me you actually

13:45.284 --> 13:47.119
believe in this
religious crap.

14:26.367 --> 14:28.702
Oh...

14:31.121 --> 14:32.790
Are you sure no one
will come in?

14:32.998 --> 14:35.251
Does it seem
like I'm sure?

14:35.459 --> 14:36.919
Ha ha ha!

15:02.194 --> 15:03.654
Everyone finish
what you're doing.

15:03.863 --> 15:06.448
Meet me at the armory.

15:06.657 --> 15:08.075
Why?
What's going on?

15:08.284 --> 15:09.451
Bellamy, on radio:
You'll see when you get here.

15:09.660 --> 15:12.079
- We just got lucky.
- On our way.

15:12.288 --> 15:14.790
Wait. Leave Alie 2.

15:14.999 --> 15:16.792
Why?

15:17.001 --> 15:18.294
I think I know how
to activate it.

15:18.502 --> 15:19.545
Without
a nightblood?

15:19.753 --> 15:20.880
This section here
codes for activation

15:21.088 --> 15:23.591
using a spoken
passphrase.

15:23.799 --> 15:24.967
You can
read that?

15:25.175 --> 15:26.760
That's--
no. How?

15:26.969 --> 15:28.012
None of our systems
are in this language,

15:28.220 --> 15:29.513
and you're
a lousy coder.

15:29.722 --> 15:30.556
Here.

15:32.266 --> 15:33.809
What phrase?

15:34.018 --> 15:37.438
It's doesn't say.
It could be anything.

15:37.605 --> 15:41.275
It was in Lexa, right?
She would've known it.

15:42.610 --> 15:45.237
Lexa didn't even
know she was an a.I.

15:45.446 --> 15:47.114
She wasn't an a.I.

15:47.323 --> 15:48.908
Her mind was just
enhanced by one.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.576
I'm guessing the reason
she didn't know was

15:50.784 --> 15:52.661
because the program
degraded over time.

15:52.870 --> 15:54.580
Parts of it got lost.

15:56.624 --> 15:58.417
Think, Clarke.

15:58.626 --> 16:01.003
It might have been a phrase
that meant something to Lexa,

16:01.211 --> 16:03.505
words she said
over and over again.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.054
"Blood must have blood."

16:15.559 --> 16:17.436
"Jus drein jus daun."

16:24.860 --> 16:26.779
"Seek
higher things."

16:29.531 --> 16:31.659
Wait.

16:31.867 --> 16:34.370
Becca's book is full
of Latin phrases.

16:34.578 --> 16:35.829
I take it Alie
didn't leave Latin

16:35.996 --> 16:37.039
behind
in your brain.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.540
I studied
some Latin.

16:40.042 --> 16:43.170
"Seek
higher things."

16:43.379 --> 16:48.342
"Altiora...Petimus."

16:48.550 --> 16:52.513
No. Go for less
literal translation.

16:52.680 --> 16:56.684
"Ascende...

16:56.892 --> 16:58.519
Superius."

17:12.157 --> 17:14.410
What happened?

17:14.618 --> 17:17.037
Ascenda superius.

17:17.246 --> 17:18.163
Huh.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.169
Oh, hey, no.

17:25.379 --> 17:29.008
It's like it
sensed your mind.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.010
When someone without the blood
takes the flame,

17:31.218 --> 17:33.512
the flame
takes their life.

17:33.721 --> 17:34.722
OK. There must
be another way

17:34.930 --> 17:36.432
to access
the code, then.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.100
There's not.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.601
Until we find it a host,

17:39.810 --> 17:42.062
we won't know
how to stop Alie.

17:42.271 --> 17:44.189
Then let's
find it a host.

17:44.398 --> 17:46.483
Come on.
Bellamy's waiting,

17:46.692 --> 17:47.776
and so's Luna.

17:47.985 --> 17:50.070
OK. We'll
catch up.

17:51.739 --> 17:54.950
So what else do you know
that no one ever taught you?

17:57.536 --> 17:58.662
Once we find Luna,
this will all be over.

17:58.871 --> 18:00.748
Ontari'll be exposed
as a fraud,

18:00.956 --> 18:04.084
and the a.I. Will tell us
how to shut down Alie.

18:06.712 --> 18:08.839
If we shut down Alie,

18:09.048 --> 18:11.592
what happens
to the city of light?

18:11.800 --> 18:15.429
Your mom will come back
like raven did.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.639
What about mine?

18:19.308 --> 18:22.227
[Music box playing
"rock-a-bye baby"

18:22.436 --> 18:24.354
someone's here.

18:28.650 --> 18:31.278
Following the creepy
music is a bad idea.

18:35.365 --> 18:38.118
Or we can follow
the creepy music.

19:18.117 --> 19:20.244
"Aaron."

19:22.454 --> 19:25.207
I don't like this.
We should go.

19:29.628 --> 19:31.755
Get out. Run!

19:59.908 --> 20:01.118
Oh!

20:11.628 --> 20:13.088
- Clarke--
- Bellamy--

20:13.297 --> 20:15.799
Clarke, oh,
what is it?

20:16.008 --> 20:18.552
What's going on?

20:18.760 --> 20:21.263
Emerson.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.363
Emori, you got to leave
Polis, all right?

20:38.572 --> 20:39.448
Oh...

20:39.656 --> 20:42.159
Hey, it's not
safe for you here.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.745
I can look
after myself.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.501
Ha ha ha!

20:51.710 --> 20:53.795
Now, how the hell
did you pull this off?

20:54.004 --> 20:55.214
Well, you know me.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.216
Just doing what I can
to stay alive, right?

20:57.424 --> 20:59.509
You're cute
when you're modest.

21:01.803 --> 21:04.890
I'm being serious,
though.

21:05.098 --> 21:08.685
Ontari, she's crazy, and
that's coming from me.

21:08.894 --> 21:10.729
The only reason
why I'm still breathing,

21:10.938 --> 21:13.190
she thinks I know how
to make her the commander.

21:13.398 --> 21:16.193
I thought she was
the commander.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.570
Not technically. No.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.322
To be the commander,
you have to shove

21:20.530 --> 21:23.158
a computer chip
into your brain.

21:23.367 --> 21:26.453
These fools think
it's reincarnation.

21:26.662 --> 21:29.456
Why would you think
you could do this?

21:29.623 --> 21:31.625
Because I saw it come
out of the last commander.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.294
Don't ask.

21:34.503 --> 21:38.006
So what do you
do for her now?

21:41.260 --> 21:44.763
She's taken
a liking to me.

21:48.684 --> 21:50.978
Who could blame her?

21:54.147 --> 21:55.732
Go.

21:57.609 --> 22:00.195
What?

22:01.738 --> 22:05.325
Heda requires your
presence, flame keeper.

22:06.702 --> 22:09.705
Of course she does.
Thank you.

22:21.008 --> 22:24.094
So important.

22:24.303 --> 22:26.179
I got to go.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.307
Stay here, OK?
You'll be safe.

22:39.234 --> 22:41.445
Where's Monty?

22:41.653 --> 22:44.406
Emerson took him.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.160
Why?

22:48.368 --> 22:50.454
Octavia, can you
hear me? Come in.

22:50.662 --> 22:51.997
Jasper was with her.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.166
Jasper, are you there?
Say something.

22:57.544 --> 23:01.089
Miller, Harper, Bryan.

23:01.298 --> 23:03.633
This is all my fault.

23:03.842 --> 23:05.802
I let Emerson live.

23:06.011 --> 23:08.513
What are you
talking about?

23:08.722 --> 23:11.683
In Polis, I had
a chance to kill him,

23:11.892 --> 23:14.144
and I let him go.

23:14.353 --> 23:16.438
Raven, on radio:
Bellamy, what's wrong?

23:16.646 --> 23:18.690
Raven, are you OK?
Where are you?

23:18.899 --> 23:20.400
Still in engineering.
We're fine.

23:20.609 --> 23:22.069
Clarke, on radio:
Raven, listen to me.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.154
Emerson is here.
Are the others with you?

23:24.363 --> 23:26.531
Raven, on radio:
Negative. Just Sinclair.

23:26.740 --> 23:28.408
Mount weather Emerson?

23:28.617 --> 23:30.827
Yes. OK.
Lock down the hangar bay.

23:31.036 --> 23:33.038
Don't let
anyone in but us.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.539
OK.

23:37.793 --> 23:40.921
Stay here.
I'll lock the doors.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.839
Is this guy
Emerson chipped?

23:43.048 --> 23:45.008
He wasn't
as of yesterday.

23:49.429 --> 23:52.015
He wants revenge.

23:52.224 --> 23:54.226
- Raven--
- shh shh shh.

23:55.936 --> 23:58.146
He's here.
He's inside the hangar bay.

23:58.355 --> 23:59.648
- Oh!
- Raven, I'm coming.

23:59.856 --> 24:01.483
Open the hangar door! Ah!

24:01.691 --> 24:03.902
He cut the power,
so do it manually.

24:05.737 --> 24:08.198
- Raven!
- Raven!

24:08.407 --> 24:10.117
Uh...Uh...

24:10.325 --> 24:12.411
The outer door.

24:14.913 --> 24:16.623
Ah!

24:16.832 --> 24:18.041
Yah! Gah!

24:18.250 --> 24:20.293
Raven, get back in the rover!
Lock the door!

24:23.296 --> 24:25.549
Agh!

24:25.757 --> 24:27.259
Uh...

24:29.803 --> 24:30.887
Uh!

24:31.096 --> 24:32.431
Uh...Uh...Agh!

24:32.639 --> 24:33.682
No.

24:33.890 --> 24:35.767
Uh...

24:38.437 --> 24:41.106
No, no, no, no.
Please stay in the rover.

24:43.108 --> 24:44.818
Stay in the rover,
please.

24:45.026 --> 24:46.194
Stay in the rover.

24:46.403 --> 24:47.404
Stay--stay
in the rover.

24:47.612 --> 24:48.864
Stay--stay in the rover.

24:49.072 --> 24:49.990
Stay
in the rover.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.199
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

24:51.408 --> 24:54.244
No. Uh--agh.
It's OK. It's OK.

24:54.453 --> 24:56.121
- Shh shh shh shh.
- It's OK. Stay in the rover.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.456
- Stay in the rover.
- Shh shh shh shh.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.708
Just go back,
please.

24:59.916 --> 25:02.169
Please go back.
Go back.

25:02.377 --> 25:04.296
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

25:04.504 --> 25:07.299
No, no. Stay--
stay in the rover.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.301
Stay in the rover.
Stay in the rover.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.970
Stay--

25:12.179 --> 25:14.264
agh! Agh! Agh!

25:14.473 --> 25:16.391
Aah! Aah!

25:16.600 --> 25:18.226
Aah...

25:26.485 --> 25:27.903
Raven. Sinclair.

25:28.111 --> 25:31.114
Raven. After me.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.914
Sinclair.

25:53.220 --> 25:56.806
We're too late.

25:57.015 --> 26:00.477
No, we're not.

26:01.895 --> 26:04.397
He didn't kill
Monty or raven.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.233
He would have
left their bodies.

26:06.441 --> 26:07.859
He took them somewhere.

26:08.068 --> 26:09.903
If you're right,
Octavia

26:10.111 --> 26:11.530
and the others
are there, too.

26:13.573 --> 26:16.159
Where would he
be taking them?

26:16.368 --> 26:17.744
They could be
anywhere.

26:17.953 --> 26:19.454
Does he even know
his way around?

26:19.663 --> 26:21.331
He was here.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.250
You were in
mount weather.

26:25.335 --> 26:27.629
The airlock.

26:30.632 --> 26:34.594
Emerson, I know
you're listening.

26:34.803 --> 26:37.055
We need to talk.

26:43.728 --> 26:47.816
I don't need
to do anything.

26:48.024 --> 26:52.070
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

26:52.279 --> 26:55.156
And now you're here
to kill me. Is that it?

26:55.365 --> 26:57.617
Something like that.

26:57.826 --> 27:00.579
Then let
my friends go.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.664
Do that, and
you can have me.

27:02.872 --> 27:04.291
You're brave,
Clarke.

27:04.499 --> 27:05.584
Clarke--

27:05.792 --> 27:06.668
I'll give you
that.

27:06.876 --> 27:08.211
I know
what I'm doing.

27:08.420 --> 27:11.256
They're lucky to have
a friend like you.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.719
Come to the airlock,
no weapons, right now.

27:20.849 --> 27:22.100
Here.

27:22.309 --> 27:23.435
What the hell
are you doing?

27:23.643 --> 27:25.937
Saving them. Look.

27:26.146 --> 27:29.024
When it's over,
take this to Luna.

27:29.232 --> 27:31.359
Raven'll know
what to do with it.

27:31.568 --> 27:33.361
Promise me.

27:33.570 --> 27:35.280
No.

27:35.488 --> 27:36.865
You're out of your mind
if you think

27:37.073 --> 27:38.825
I'm letting you
do this alone.

27:39.034 --> 27:41.161
Bellamy,
this is my fault.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.955
I'm not letting anyone
else die for my mistake,

27:44.164 --> 27:45.540
OK, so take it.

27:45.749 --> 27:47.626
You through?

27:47.834 --> 27:48.960
I don't know
what happened

27:49.169 --> 27:51.171
between you and
Emerson in Polis,

27:51.379 --> 27:52.672
but I do know
that letting him

27:52.881 --> 27:56.134
kill you here today
is a stupid plan.

27:56.343 --> 27:59.304
You got a better one?

27:59.512 --> 28:02.182
Distract him.
I shoot him.

28:17.906 --> 28:21.242
Commander's
decision is final.

28:21.451 --> 28:22.410
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Heda.

28:22.619 --> 28:24.621
You're next.
Come on.

28:24.829 --> 28:26.831
Step forward.

28:35.423 --> 28:37.384
Only to give you
what you need.

28:37.592 --> 28:39.219
You son of a bitch.

28:40.929 --> 28:42.972
Hello, John.

28:43.181 --> 28:44.808
You've done well
for yourself, I see.

28:45.016 --> 28:47.185
Who is this?

28:47.394 --> 28:50.647
Your flame keeper
and I are old friends.

28:50.855 --> 28:53.692
Friends.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.694
You know,
I don't know what

28:55.902 --> 28:57.737
you're doing here,
Jaha,

28:57.946 --> 29:00.240
but if I were you,
I'd leave

29:00.448 --> 29:02.033
while I still can.

29:03.868 --> 29:06.162
You don't have to be
a false commander.

29:17.132 --> 29:19.134
How do you
know that?

29:19.342 --> 29:21.886
You told me...

29:22.095 --> 29:23.972
He's lying.

29:24.180 --> 29:25.515
Obviously, you should
kill him right now

29:25.724 --> 29:26.891
for insulting you.

29:27.100 --> 29:29.144
Just as you told me
you would be unable

29:29.352 --> 29:31.479
to perform the
ascension ritual,

29:31.688 --> 29:35.233
even if you had
the flame.

29:42.991 --> 29:44.993
You?

29:48.413 --> 29:50.874
You took the chip.

29:51.082 --> 29:52.751
This is the girl
from the market.

29:52.959 --> 29:55.170
You acted as if
you didn't know her.

29:55.378 --> 29:57.672
I'm his lover.

29:57.881 --> 29:59.924
Really?

30:00.133 --> 30:01.342
Ontari,
listen to me.

30:01.551 --> 30:03.553
You cannot trust
these people.

30:03.762 --> 30:06.973
Seems the only person
I can't trust is you.

30:07.182 --> 30:10.518
I told you what would happen
if you betrayed me.

30:12.395 --> 30:15.023
You kill him,

30:15.231 --> 30:18.193
I won't help you.

30:18.401 --> 30:19.694
Why?

30:23.782 --> 30:27.702
He's a fraud,
but he does have knowledge

30:27.911 --> 30:30.872
that could be useful
to all of us.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.208
Trust me.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.133
Ontari, listen
to me, OK?

30:42.342 --> 30:43.927
Nothing this man says
is the truth, OK?

30:44.135 --> 30:45.595
You can't believe--
let go of me.

30:45.804 --> 30:48.181
Jaha! Listen to me.

30:48.389 --> 30:49.808
Ontari, you can't
believe anything--

30:51.017 --> 30:53.144
don't take
anything--

30:53.353 --> 30:54.896
no! No!

30:56.022 --> 30:59.067
You're ruling

30:59.275 --> 31:02.654
without the wisdom of
the commander's spirit.

31:02.862 --> 31:05.448
Your people will
soon figure that out.

31:05.657 --> 31:08.576
I can offer you
something

31:08.785 --> 31:12.664
even more powerful
than the flame--

31:12.872 --> 31:17.043
true legacy
of Bekka Pramheda,

31:17.252 --> 31:21.840
all power,
all wisdom

31:22.048 --> 31:25.343
contained
in one simple key.

31:30.431 --> 31:33.059
All you have to do
is swallow it.

32:06.593 --> 32:09.012
I held up my part
of the deal.

32:09.220 --> 32:10.513
Your turn.

32:10.722 --> 32:13.433
Let my friends go.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.894
Tell Bellamy to show
himself first.

32:16.102 --> 32:17.353
I don't know
what you're talk--

32:17.562 --> 32:18.771
- Raah!
- Uh!

32:18.980 --> 32:20.857
No.

32:26.070 --> 32:27.488
Good.

32:27.697 --> 32:31.910
Now take out the clip.
Throw it down the hall.

32:32.118 --> 32:34.621
Put the gun
on the ground

32:34.829 --> 32:36.205
and get inside.

32:36.414 --> 32:38.041
Uh-uh.

32:38.249 --> 32:40.501
Please.
You wanted me.

32:40.710 --> 32:43.588
I'll get inside
once you let them go.

32:43.796 --> 32:46.215
I was talking
to Bellamy.

32:46.424 --> 32:49.636
OK, OK.
Just--just stop.

32:51.387 --> 32:53.765
Bellamy, don't.

32:53.973 --> 32:55.475
G'uh...

33:25.254 --> 33:27.340
Those are yours.

33:33.429 --> 33:35.807
Uh!

33:39.644 --> 33:41.938
Get on your knees,
Clarke.

33:46.609 --> 33:49.570
Put your hands
behind your head.

34:02.583 --> 34:04.335
No.

34:06.421 --> 34:08.089
You can do anything
you want with me, OK?

34:08.297 --> 34:09.507
Just let them go.

34:09.716 --> 34:11.509
Uh...Uh...Uh...

34:11.718 --> 34:14.095
Uh! Uh...

34:15.888 --> 34:19.142
You murdered
381 people.

34:19.350 --> 34:20.476
Ah!

34:20.685 --> 34:23.021
You took the lives
of my children,

34:23.229 --> 34:26.149
my brother,
my friends.

34:26.357 --> 34:29.694
Did you really think
that I would be happy

34:29.902 --> 34:34.323
with just one life
in return, hmm?

34:34.532 --> 34:36.367
Agh! Uh!

34:40.538 --> 34:44.584
Voice, on P.A.:
Airlock 5, oxygen venting.

34:44.792 --> 34:47.837
Airlock 5,
oxygen venting.

34:49.547 --> 34:52.008
Now you're gonna feel
what I felt.

34:52.216 --> 34:53.301
Ah!

34:56.429 --> 35:00.266
Beg me to stop it.

35:00.433 --> 35:02.101
I told you to beg!

35:02.310 --> 35:03.811
- I'm begging you.
- Louder!

35:04.020 --> 35:06.022
Please!

35:06.230 --> 35:07.815
Bellamy...

35:09.984 --> 35:11.903
Uh...

35:12.111 --> 35:15.656
Aaron wouldn't want
you to do this.

35:15.865 --> 35:17.658
You don't
say his name!

35:17.867 --> 35:20.453
- Uh!
- Ah!

35:20.661 --> 35:23.206
Ah! Uh!

35:23.414 --> 35:25.416
Uh! No! Uh!

35:25.625 --> 35:26.918
Ooh!

35:29.045 --> 35:32.715
- Rrgh!
- Agh...

35:32.924 --> 35:36.552
Nngh...Raagh!

35:36.761 --> 35:37.887
Ugh...

35:38.096 --> 35:40.014
Rrgh!

35:40.223 --> 35:42.058
No...

35:42.266 --> 35:43.810
Not yet.

35:45.144 --> 35:46.521
Rrgh!

35:54.779 --> 35:57.865
First, you'll
watch them die.

35:58.074 --> 36:00.409
Agh...

36:00.618 --> 36:02.036
Uh!

36:04.497 --> 36:08.835
You have any last words
for your friends?

36:09.043 --> 36:10.753
Yeah.

36:10.962 --> 36:13.172
Ascende superius.

36:19.303 --> 36:20.805
Uh...

36:21.013 --> 36:23.307
Ugh!

36:23.516 --> 36:25.476
What--

36:25.685 --> 36:27.812
uh! Eegh! Uh!

36:28.020 --> 36:29.939
Oh! No.

37:59.946 --> 38:01.697
No.

38:54.208 --> 38:56.085
May we meet again.

39:08.973 --> 39:11.434
Yu gonplei ste odon.

39:22.361 --> 39:25.031
Yu gonplei
ste odon.

39:45.259 --> 39:49.472
It's time to go.
I'll get the map.

40:21.796 --> 40:24.131
Hey, we're leaving.
Why aren't you ready?

40:24.340 --> 40:26.258
We're not
going with you.

40:26.467 --> 40:27.718
Raven--

40:27.927 --> 40:29.637
he can barely walk,
and my shoulder's killing me.

40:29.845 --> 40:32.098
My brain's all kinds
of awesome.

40:32.306 --> 40:33.682
She remembered that Alie
downloaded herself

40:33.891 --> 40:35.267
into the ark mainframe.

40:35.476 --> 40:36.936
If the code
is still there,

40:37.144 --> 40:38.729
we might be able
to find a back door.

40:38.938 --> 40:40.481
I'm guessing
once you connect Alie 2

40:40.689 --> 40:42.775
to Luna, we'll need
to access Alie 1

40:42.983 --> 40:44.693
to take her down.

40:44.902 --> 40:46.529
Miller.

40:46.737 --> 40:47.988
We'll keep
them safe.

40:48.197 --> 40:49.824
I'll keep
them safe.

40:50.032 --> 40:53.119
How about you?
It's gonna be dangerous.

40:53.327 --> 40:56.872
You know me
well. I'm in.

40:57.081 --> 40:58.666
OK.

41:47.631 --> 41:49.550
The gates to Polis
are open.

41:49.758 --> 41:52.386
Thank you, Emori.

41:52.595 --> 41:56.182
It's time to fill
the city of light.
