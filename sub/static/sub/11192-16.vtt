WEBVTT

00:33.799 --> 00:37.003
<i>This wasn't going on
when we sent the probe through.</i>

00:36.959 --> 00:39.496
<i>- What's in the air?
- Ash.</i>

00:39.478 --> 00:43.475
<i>Daniel, dial it up.
Get us outta here. No argument.</i>

00:45.476 --> 00:47.552
Wait a minute.

00:51.597 --> 00:54.265
There's something out there.

01:00.953 --> 01:04.736
It's a woman! She's alive!
There's more. Hurry, you guys!

01:12.590 --> 01:15.674
- There's no life here.
- This one's had it.

01:22.549 --> 01:27.674
It's just like Pompeii. Everyone suffocated
before the lava started to flow.

01:36.905 --> 01:38.980
What are these things?

01:38.984 --> 01:41.605
O'Neill, there are two more alive!

01:44.623 --> 01:47.375
Carter? How long before we're toast?

01:47.343 --> 01:51.506
I don't know, sir. I'm not a volcanologist.
It could be days or minutes.

02:08.698 --> 02:10.774
Don't...

02:11.616 --> 02:12.944
help us.

03:29.158 --> 03:31.531
<i>Clear the way.
Give 'em some room.</i>

03:38.954 --> 03:40.033
Let's go.

03:40.075 --> 03:42.281
<i>- You OK?
- Yeah.</i>

03:47.433 --> 03:49.972
Colonel O'Neill, what happened?

03:49.953 --> 03:54.698
We encountered some
very severe volcanic activity, sir.

03:54.593 --> 03:56.882
- Who are these people?
- We don't know.

03:56.872 --> 04:00.288
They were all dying around the gate.
The air was toxic.

04:00.230 --> 04:01.688
And hot.

04:01.710 --> 04:05.457
Have Dr. Fraiser take a look at you.
We'll debrief when you're ready.

04:05.389 --> 04:06.931
Yes, sir.

04:07.390 --> 04:11.340
You evacuated ten people
from an alien planet, Colonel.

04:11.268 --> 04:14.602
Dr. Fraiser says they're all human
and they're going to live.

04:14.546 --> 04:18.211
- This was one hell of a rescue operation.
- Thank you, sir.

04:18.146 --> 04:21.764
- There were no buildings in the area?
- No, sir.

04:21.706 --> 04:25.156
It looked like they were trying
to make it back to the Stargate.

04:25.105 --> 04:27.346
What about the devices
they were wearing?

04:27.343 --> 04:31.093
They emit radiation, indicating
an operative energy source,

04:31.023 --> 04:35.435
but there's no circuitry, moving parts
or chips. We've seen nothing like it.

04:35.343 --> 04:39.840
I thought they were from a parallel
culture, but they may be way ahead of us.

04:39.740 --> 04:44.069
We've determined humans on
other planets originated here on Earth.

04:45.060 --> 04:46.471
Yes.

04:46.500 --> 04:50.367
Given our present state of technology,
could they be ahead of us?

04:50.298 --> 04:52.125
Yes.

04:52.137 --> 04:55.755
We'd be colonising space now
if it hadn't been for the Dark Ages.

04:55.697 --> 05:00.026
For a period of over 800 years,
science was heresy and anathema.

04:59.937 --> 05:02.012
Maybe they didn't have that setback.

05:02.016 --> 05:04.934
The spokesman for
the rescued people is awake.

05:04.896 --> 05:07.648
He'd like to speak with you. All of you.

05:12.934 --> 05:15.805
<i>Attention,
all off-duty medical personnel,</i>

05:15.773 --> 05:19.023
<i>report to the infirmary, sublevel 20, stat.</i>

05:33.567 --> 05:34.896
Who are you?

05:34.928 --> 05:38.048
I'm Major General Hammond.
This is Colonel O'Neill.

05:38.007 --> 05:40.759
- Jack.
- Samantha Carter.

05:40.726 --> 05:43.728
- Daniel Jackson.
- What is this place?

05:43.685 --> 05:47.303
You're on a planet called Earth.
These people saved you.

05:47.245 --> 05:50.117
Nothing could be further from the truth.

05:51.084 --> 05:55.081
Unless I miss something,
you're better off here than there.

05:55.004 --> 05:56.829
A rescue transport was on the way.

05:56.843 --> 06:00.793
Half your people were already dead.
It wouldn't have gotten there in time.

06:00.723 --> 06:03.807
Perhaps that's more a problem for you
than it was for us.

06:03.761 --> 06:06.762
- Beg your pardon?
- I find it unbelievable

06:06.721 --> 06:10.766
that anyone so primitive could've
deciphered the gate system.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.853
Did you say "primitive"?

06:13.879 --> 06:17.711
I too am from a world
very different from this one.

06:17.639 --> 06:20.093
Here, life is highly valued.

06:20.076 --> 06:22.615
Quite a statement for a Jaffa.

06:26.156 --> 06:30.237
Sir, I'd like to know who you are
and what you know about the Goa'uld.

06:30.154 --> 06:35.066
I am Omoc. Our world is called Tollan.

06:34.954 --> 06:38.822
And what do you know
of the Goa'uld and Jaffa?

06:38.752 --> 06:42.370
We're aware of them.
We don't interact with them.

06:42.312 --> 06:44.553
Then we share a common enemy.

06:46.151 --> 06:49.187
Did I mention an enemy?

06:49.151 --> 06:54.276
I only meant it might benefit everyone
if your people and ours could be friends.

06:55.548 --> 07:00.257
I demand you return everything you've
taken from us and allow us to go home.

07:01.548 --> 07:05.000
It could take a while
for those volcanoes to quiet down.

07:04.947 --> 07:07.319
In the meantime, I'm a bit of a culture buff.

07:07.305 --> 07:10.889
I'd like to learn about
your history and customs.

07:11.425 --> 07:13.999
I've said enough. I'll say no more.

07:35.420 --> 07:38.920
Captain Carter, monitor
the situation on Tollan very closely.

07:38.858 --> 07:42.062
As soon as it's safe there,
I want those people gone.

07:42.018 --> 07:43.725
Yes, sir.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.435
- New hobby?
- Neat, huh?

08:02.413 --> 08:05.449
Miniature UAV,
with all the bells and whistles.

08:05.413 --> 08:08.697
Just adding heat sensors,
so I can send it to Tollan.

08:08.651 --> 08:09.850
Mm.

08:09.891 --> 08:13.757
I was just down in the infirmary,
trying to get them to talk to us.

08:13.690 --> 08:16.396
They only ask questions,
never answer them.

08:16.370 --> 08:20.069
One of them was asking
a lot of questions about you.

08:20.009 --> 08:22.843
I thought they weren't interested in us.

08:22.809 --> 08:25.478
I didn't say "us". I said "you".

08:25.447 --> 08:29.197
General Hammond thinks you'll
have better luck getting answers.

08:29.127 --> 08:31.202
He'd like to see you.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.788
OK.

08:33.804 --> 08:38.551
I was hoping he would open up to you
a bit more than Dr. Jackson or myself.

08:41.802 --> 08:45.385
- You remember Narim.
- Yes, from the planet.

08:45.322 --> 08:48.905
- You were a lot dirtier then.
- Um...

08:48.841 --> 08:50.004
Captain Carter.

08:50.043 --> 08:53.625
- Or is it "Doctor"?
- Why don't we just make it Samantha?

08:53.559 --> 08:55.682
- You may call me Narim.
- Yeah.

08:55.681 --> 08:59.975
Captain Carter, Mr. Narim seems
very interested in our planet.

08:59.879 --> 09:03.830
Maybe you'd like to escort him
up to the surface to have a look.

09:03.759 --> 09:07.376
- Really?
- I'd be pleased to have that opportunity.

09:07.317 --> 09:10.484
You must give me your word
you'll stay with Captain Carter.

09:10.436 --> 09:12.309
You have my word.

09:12.317 --> 09:14.605
Great. Let's go.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.340
Sir.

09:33.311 --> 09:38.649
I wanted to tell you...
that I'm glad to be alive.

09:38.510 --> 09:40.798
- So are the others.
- Good.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.327
Thank you. And please tell your friends.

09:43.309 --> 09:47.224
- Oh. You can tell them yourself.
- No, I can't.

09:47.148 --> 09:50.480
- I shouldn't be talking to you.
- Why not?

09:51.547 --> 09:55.331
You know, back on Tollan,
I thought I was dying.

09:55.265 --> 09:59.264
I heard your voice,
I managed to open my eyes, and, uh...

09:59.184 --> 10:01.557
when I saw you...

10:01.544 --> 10:03.951
<i>What?</i>

10:03.943 --> 10:06.898
An old superstition.
There was a time before science

10:06.864 --> 10:10.232
when my ancestors believed
in all manner of nonsense.

10:10.182 --> 10:12.259
Like the sher-mal.

10:12.261 --> 10:15.880
The story goes that, if a sher-mal
appears at the moment of death,

10:15.821 --> 10:21.241
- She'll take you to her home in the stars.
- Ah. We call them angels.

10:21.100 --> 10:24.765
- Then you still believe in them.
- Some of us do.

10:24.700 --> 10:27.451
Ours were reported to be quite beautiful.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.206
And when I saw you, well...

10:31.057 --> 10:33.346
you seemed to fit the description.

10:35.296 --> 10:39.211
Then I learned from Dr. Jackson
that you're also a brilliant scientist.

10:39.135 --> 10:42.719
- Wow.
- I'm afraid I asked quite a few questions.

10:43.134 --> 10:44.331
Curiosity.

10:44.374 --> 10:47.245
It's a quality Omoc doesn't seem to share.

10:48.293 --> 10:51.626
- Can you tell me about your world?
- Yeah, of course.

10:58.890 --> 11:03.636
- A flying animal.
- Yeah. We call them birds.

11:04.171 --> 11:08.168
- Are there other animals?
- Yeah, millions of them.

11:09.809 --> 11:12.928
There've been none on Tollan
for generations.

11:14.248 --> 11:16.822
I could bring you pictures, if you like.

11:19.246 --> 11:22.366
- I would like that very much. Thank you.
- OK.

11:22.325 --> 11:25.610
But I think it would be best
if Omoc didn't know.

11:25.565 --> 11:27.273
Why?

11:27.283 --> 11:29.490
Omoc is not as harsh as he seems.

11:29.484 --> 11:32.687
He is only trying to protect us... and you.

11:34.123 --> 11:36.365
- From what?
- Perhaps...

11:43.280 --> 11:45.403
Perhaps we should go back.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.197
OK.

11:50.639 --> 11:52.630
<i>Chevron six engaged.</i>

11:58.717 --> 12:00.793
Chevron seven locked.

12:03.676 --> 12:06.249
<i>Launching UAV in ten seconds.</i>

12:06.235 --> 12:09.605
Nine... eight... seven...

12:09.553 --> 12:13.089
six... five... four...

12:13.033 --> 12:16.485
three... two... one.

12:20.192 --> 12:22.350
<i>- Yeah.
- Successful launch.</i>

12:22.350 --> 12:27.058
UAV is holding course in the wormhole,
should reach the Tollan gate in three...

12:26.951 --> 12:28.576
two... one.

12:30.749 --> 12:34.366
Temperature, ground:
1700 degrees Fahrenheit.

12:34.307 --> 12:38.638
Air seems to be in pockets ranging
from 1,500 degrees down to 200.

12:38.548 --> 12:42.167
- Sounds like LA.
- If the heat doesn't get you, the air will.

12:42.385 --> 12:47.462
It's mostly pyroclastics, basalt, ash.
A person could suffocate very quickly.

12:47.345 --> 12:50.049
How long before it cools down?

12:50.025 --> 12:52.313
I don't know. Not any time soon.

12:53.504 --> 12:57.917
Doesn't look like it'll matter. That lava's
flowing straight toward the gate.

12:58.782 --> 13:03.859
Computer predicts that at the current rate
the gate will be buried in a couple of days.

13:05.261 --> 13:08.096
Looks like we've got
some guests for a while.

13:10.379 --> 13:13.913
<i>- Are you absolutely certain?
- Yes. I'm sorry.</i>

13:17.018 --> 13:20.717
Then nature succeeded where we failed.

13:20.657 --> 13:23.990
What? You were going to seal the gate?

13:23.936 --> 13:27.056
Tollan is a world in cataclysm.

13:27.456 --> 13:30.873
Evacuation was complete.
My team stayed to, uh...

13:36.854 --> 13:40.269
Our final task was to close the gate,

13:40.212 --> 13:42.585
so that no one could
return and be harmed.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.941
Wherever you were going,
we can recalibrate the coordinates.

13:45.890 --> 13:51.052
The new settlement world is outside
the gate system. We'll need a ship.

13:50.931 --> 13:54.429
Oh, uh... we don't have ships.

13:54.369 --> 13:56.408
Not that kind, anyway.

13:56.408 --> 13:58.947
Our space programme is relatively new.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.802
Your survivors have become refugees.

14:04.768 --> 14:09.061
If they don't wanna be here,
we've got to relocate them somewhere.

14:08.966 --> 14:13.129
You know, General, we have done
some fairly good deeds out there.

14:13.044 --> 14:15.750
Maybe we should try
calling in some markers.

14:15.725 --> 14:19.307
OK. Colonel, you and Teal'c
follow up on that.

14:19.244 --> 14:22.115
Maybe go pay a visit
to some of our old friends.

14:22.081 --> 14:26.744
Captain Carter and Dr. Jackson, get
the multipurpose room on 5-C readied

14:26.640 --> 14:29.096
as a refugee housing centre.

14:29.081 --> 14:30.361
Yes, sir.

14:34.519 --> 14:38.730
As an act of good faith, we're returning
the devices you were wearing.

14:38.639 --> 14:42.303
- They are not weapons.
- That's what our technicians thought.

14:42.238 --> 14:44.812
So you had them tested?

14:44.798 --> 14:47.086
Not much of an act of good faith.

14:47.076 --> 14:50.493
Actually, we couldn't figure out
exactly what they were.

14:50.436 --> 14:54.563
I want to assure you we're doing
all we can to relocate your people.

14:56.475 --> 14:58.847
- Are we to have some say in the matter?
- Yes.

14:58.834 --> 15:01.538
Self-determination is very important to us.

15:01.514 --> 15:05.462
In the meantime, we'll make you
as comfortable as possible.

15:05.393 --> 15:08.596
But you're restricted to
the immediate premises.

15:08.552 --> 15:12.217
- Are we prisoners?
- No. No, absolutely not.

15:12.149 --> 15:16.977
But you are from an alien environment.
It's as much for your safety as for ours.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.552
Hey. How you doin'?

15:32.546 --> 15:38.335
It may sound ridiculous, but I have
no idea what to do with these items.

15:38.184 --> 15:42.312
Our sleeping platforms adjust
automatically to our body temperature.

15:42.224 --> 15:45.307
They don't come with accoutrements.

15:45.264 --> 15:49.096
I'll show you. I brought you
some things to take a look at.

15:51.540 --> 15:52.821
Thank you.

15:55.299 --> 15:56.379
You're welcome.

15:59.620 --> 16:03.202
You might like to see this first.

16:09.856 --> 16:14.020
<i>Oh. I never thought
I'd see a living animal.</i>

16:13.937 --> 16:16.474
His name's Schrรถdinger.

16:18.774 --> 16:22.357
It's kind of a joke, really. His name, that is.

16:22.294 --> 16:24.667
<i>Schrรถdinger's cat.</i>

16:24.653 --> 16:26.230
Oh?

16:27.213 --> 16:31.424
Right. There was an Earth physicist
by the name of Erwin Schrรถdinger.

16:31.331 --> 16:35.328
He had this theoretical experiment.
Put a cat in a box,

16:35.250 --> 16:38.834
add a can of poison gas activated
by the decay of a radioactive atom,

16:38.769 --> 16:40.727
and close the box.

16:40.729 --> 16:44.975
- Sounds like a cruel man.
- No, it was a theory. He never really did it.

16:44.889 --> 16:49.681
He said that, if he did do it, the cat
would be dead and alive at the same time.

16:49.567 --> 16:52.187
Aha, quilebrium physics.

16:52.167 --> 16:55.168
An atom's state is indeterminate
until measured.

16:55.126 --> 16:58.662
We call it quantum physics.
You know the theory?

16:58.605 --> 17:00.764
Yeah, I've studied it.

17:00.764 --> 17:04.548
In among other misconceptions
of elementary science.

17:04.483 --> 17:06.357
Misconceptions?

17:06.363 --> 17:09.814
You telling me that you guys
have licked quantum physics?

17:11.883 --> 17:13.959
Omoc...

17:18.201 --> 17:21.367
Uh... I'll come back
and help you with this later.

17:29.478 --> 17:31.969
I did not tell her anything.

17:38.076 --> 17:40.911
We set up a meeting with Tuplo
for 0800 tomorrow.

17:40.875 --> 17:44.707
Many of the worlds we have visited
are eager to be of service.

17:44.634 --> 17:48.548
People, we have a problem.
Your refugees seem to have escaped.

17:48.472 --> 17:50.346
<i>- Escaped?
- How?</i>

17:50.352 --> 17:52.392
Ask them that when you find them.

18:03.630 --> 18:05.705
<i>They're over here!</i>

18:07.469 --> 18:09.545
Hold fire!

18:30.303 --> 18:33.055
We were merely observing the stars.

18:33.022 --> 18:35.775
You're all gonna have to
come back in now.

18:35.742 --> 18:37.487
<i>So we are prisoners.</i>

18:41.141 --> 18:43.298
Any idea how they got past the guards?

18:43.300 --> 18:47.346
The surveillance video in the room was
exposed to some sort of interference

18:47.259 --> 18:50.426
- Just as the escape was taking place.
- Convenient.

18:50.378 --> 18:54.423
- Can the video be computer-enhanced?
- We're trying now.

18:54.337 --> 18:57.587
In the meantime, we should
get this show on the road.

19:06.694 --> 19:08.770
Tuplo. Good to see you.

19:10.615 --> 19:13.188
General Hammond, before we begin,

19:13.173 --> 19:17.040
I wish to thank you for allowing me
to be the first visitor to Earth

19:16.972 --> 19:18.964
from the Land of Light.

19:18.971 --> 19:21.296
It is indeed an honour.

19:27.210 --> 19:29.084
My lord Omoc,

19:29.089 --> 19:34.878
the Land of Light is a world of eternal
brightness, where fertility abounds.

19:35.009 --> 19:38.009
Our farms produce rich harvests.

19:37.967 --> 19:42.011
Our rivers are blessed with fish and fowl.

19:41.926 --> 19:46.801
We would be honoured
to share our land with your people.

19:49.964 --> 19:52.919
You have no idea who or what we are.

19:56.522 --> 19:58.147
We know that you are in need

19:58.162 --> 20:03.239
and that you are here among those
who have proven themselves our friends.

20:03.121 --> 20:05.196
That is enough.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.115
You're missing the point.

20:14.239 --> 20:17.192
His planet is unacceptable to us.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.252
These people are even
more primitive than you.

20:30.595 --> 20:35.422
Narim, can you tell me
why Omoc is so... you know.

20:35.314 --> 20:36.345
Obstinate?

20:38.992 --> 20:42.362
The nearest planet in our solar system
was called Sarita.

20:42.311 --> 20:46.724
When we began to explore space,
we learned she was inhabited.

20:46.632 --> 20:48.837
- Did you make contact?
- Yes.

20:48.832 --> 20:51.833
When we thought they were
sufficiently advanced.

20:51.789 --> 20:54.411
They were on a level very similar to yours.

20:54.388 --> 20:56.797
So what happened?

20:56.788 --> 20:58.865
We offered them a device...

20:58.867 --> 21:02.035
to produce unlimited productive energy.

21:02.586 --> 21:04.959
And they used it to make war.

21:07.705 --> 21:11.288
- How bad was it?
- In one rotation of our planet,

21:12.665 --> 21:15.583
- They had destroyed theirs.
- One day?

21:15.544 --> 21:19.541
The destruction shifted
our planet's orbit 0.3 decana.

21:19.462 --> 21:24.006
Enough to begin a chain of events
that made our world unstable.

21:23.902 --> 21:28.528
So that's why he's so afraid to give a
society like ours any of your technology.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.962
Yes.

21:31.420 --> 21:34.788
Tell me, what were you
really doing outside last night?

21:34.740 --> 21:38.987
Omoc spoke the truth.
By setting the position of your stars,

21:38.897 --> 21:43.192
we calibrated the distance
between Earth and the new home world.

21:44.856 --> 21:47.394
It is very far away, Samantha.

21:48.576 --> 21:51.115
Too far to hope for a ship in our lifetime.

21:53.973 --> 21:57.425
Have you ever thought about
staying here... on Earth?

21:58.973 --> 22:03.268
I would... gladly stay...

22:03.173 --> 22:07.919
if only to spend more time with
a certain inhabitant of this planet.

22:12.530 --> 22:14.690
I speak, of course, of Schrรถdinger.

22:16.809 --> 22:21.602
Our escape was a test. You did
exactly what I knew you would do.

22:21.489 --> 22:24.655
You used threat and force
to solve your problem.

22:24.607 --> 22:28.143
- You gave us no choice.
- You could've come for us unarmed.

22:28.086 --> 22:31.502
You haven't exactly behaved
like someone I want to trust.

22:31.445 --> 22:32.988
I won't put my team at risk.

22:33.005 --> 22:36.623
And I will not risk my people in your care.

22:37.846 --> 22:40.596
Look, Omoc, if you're so advanced,

22:40.564 --> 22:43.767
why don't you let your people
decide for themselves?

22:45.643 --> 22:50.980
Narim, this is a free country. We take in
thousands of refugees fleeing repression.

22:50.842 --> 22:54.460
If you request asylum, you can stay,
no matter what Omoc wants.

22:54.401 --> 22:59.775
You don't care about Narim's rights. You
only want our technology, nothing more.

22:59.640 --> 23:03.258
I wouldn't mind knowing how
you got the hell out of this place,

23:03.199 --> 23:04.858
technically speaking.

23:04.877 --> 23:09.338
You don't need to know how.
Only that we did.

23:09.237 --> 23:11.941
And we can do it again
any time we need to.

23:13.037 --> 23:16.536
General Hammond wants to see
you and your team right away, sir.

23:16.476 --> 23:18.135
Thank you.

23:31.310 --> 23:35.640
We've augmented the surveillance video
from the multipurpose room

23:35.550 --> 23:39.417
with computer enhancement.
You're not gonna believe this.

23:48.748 --> 23:50.657
Whoa. Cool.

23:50.667 --> 23:52.743
But totally impossible.

23:52.747 --> 23:55.913
Only from a perspective
of our limited science.

23:55.865 --> 24:00.692
We have similar video of them passing
through an elevator door and a wall.

24:00.585 --> 24:03.253
This is knowledge
far beyond that of the Goa'uld.

24:03.224 --> 24:06.759
That's what the president
and Joint Chiefs want to hear.

24:10.222 --> 24:12.261
Colonel Maybourne, sir, NID.

24:12.261 --> 24:15.048
Intelligence?
What happened to Kennedy?

24:15.021 --> 24:18.721
- Promoted. I took his place.
- Promoted?

24:18.660 --> 24:20.902
Talk about failing upwards.

24:20.901 --> 24:25.609
Colonel O'Neill. I read about your conflict
with Colonel Kennedy in his report.

24:25.499 --> 24:30.375
I assure you, such an attitude will not
prevail with me in either direction.

24:30.258 --> 24:33.294
- I sense that.
- Good.

24:33.257 --> 24:36.460
Would you mind telling me
why you're here, Colonel?

24:36.416 --> 24:38.954
You didn't get my advance?

24:44.934 --> 24:48.220
That's an order releasing
the Tollans to our section.

24:48.173 --> 24:52.634
You're to be congratulated. The Stargate
programme is finally paying off.

24:52.531 --> 24:54.572
This was quite a coup.

24:54.570 --> 24:57.655
Excuse me?
These are people we're talking about.

24:57.611 --> 25:00.861
- These people do have rights, you know.
- Do they?

25:00.810 --> 25:04.394
- Under what nation's jurisdiction?
- How about basic human rights?

25:04.329 --> 25:06.405
I can't release them to you.

25:07.608 --> 25:08.854
I beg your pardon?

25:08.887 --> 25:11.971
I don't believe the president
meant to release these people

25:11.928 --> 25:14.252
until they've been through quarantine.

25:14.248 --> 25:18.910
We don't have any idea what kinds
of diseases they might be carrying.

25:19.685 --> 25:23.304
You're out of your league.
We're playing in my ballpark now.

25:23.243 --> 25:26.280
I have the full authority of the president.

25:27.244 --> 25:30.328
So do I, Colonel.

25:30.282 --> 25:35.656
Why don't you ask the airman outside
to show you to our guest quarters?

25:35.522 --> 25:39.733
- That's OK. I'll wait.
- That wasn't an invitation.

25:39.642 --> 25:43.342
<i>It was an order, Colonel.</i>

25:51.638 --> 25:58.436
General, didn't Dr. Fraiser give
the Tollans a... clean bill of health?

25:59.797 --> 26:03.000
Just don't let her tell Maybourne that.

26:02.955 --> 26:07.451
At most, I've bought us a day, people.
Find me some alternatives.

26:08.434 --> 26:10.260
You're a good man, General.

26:11.992 --> 26:15.906
- It doesn't matter if I ask for asylum?
- Maybourne would love that.

26:15.833 --> 26:18.619
But you'd be working for him
on his terms.

26:19.471 --> 26:22.472
Then Omoc is correct.
You'll use our knowledge for war.

26:22.432 --> 26:27.343
It's not us. It's a part of our government
that specialises in chronic paranoia.

26:27.230 --> 26:29.934
Like Sarita. It's going to happen again.

26:29.910 --> 26:32.911
It doesn't have to. That's why I am here.

26:32.867 --> 26:37.529
I am hoping you can convince Omoc
to consider one of the other planets.

26:37.427 --> 26:42.385
It's no use. He's right. They're all as
primitive as you. Sarita could happen on...

26:42.267 --> 26:45.183
I wish you would stop calling us primitive.

26:46.224 --> 26:48.977
I'm sorry. I only meant technologically.

26:50.544 --> 26:53.332
You are anything but primitive, Samantha.

26:53.304 --> 26:57.301
What your mind doesn't know...
your heart fills in.

26:59.823 --> 27:04.401
I don't know what that means
exactly, but it's beautiful.

27:05.461 --> 27:08.164
Which is exactly what it means.

27:12.298 --> 27:16.876
<i>Just what exactly do you
hope to get from these people?</i>

27:16.778 --> 27:19.067
Well, for one, superior weapons.

27:20.097 --> 27:23.218
They won't cooperate, you know.

27:23.176 --> 27:25.750
I assure you, Colonel... they will.

27:30.335 --> 27:32.909
I just hung up from
talking to the president.

27:32.894 --> 27:36.227
I guess Mr. Maybourne
has been talking to him recently.

27:36.173 --> 27:39.008
I did tell you I had his ear, General.

27:38.972 --> 27:43.516
Colonel Maybourne has authorisation
to relocate the Tollans immediately.

27:43.413 --> 27:45.489
Of course he does.

27:47.971 --> 27:52.098
- Where will you take them?
- To a secure community in the Rockies.

27:52.009 --> 27:55.758
Nice community with high walls,
guards, a little barbed wire?

27:55.689 --> 27:59.638
They're a valuable asset.
They need to be protected.

27:59.567 --> 28:03.566
- Nice. Forced intellectual labour.
- And life imprisonment.

28:03.487 --> 28:06.738
These aliens will live a better life
than most Americans.

28:06.685 --> 28:11.394
They'll have a great view,
the best food, everything they need.

28:11.284 --> 28:13.775
Everything except a life.

28:14.084 --> 28:18.579
The Pentagon, Intelligence - that
I can understand. But the president?

28:19.523 --> 28:20.933
I voted for him.

28:20.962 --> 28:25.042
Colonel, have the Tollans ready
for transport at 0600 tomorrow.

28:40.638 --> 28:43.593
OK, Colonel, want to tell me
why I'm here?

28:43.557 --> 28:45.465
Because Maybourne isn't, sir.

28:45.477 --> 28:49.345
We want to talk about how we can
keep Maybourne from taking the Tollan.

28:49.277 --> 28:52.395
General, we must ensure
the Tollans escape.

28:52.355 --> 28:55.474
I can't let you do that.
We'd all be court-martialled.

28:55.434 --> 28:59.348
General, I'm about a hair away
from not caring.

29:01.113 --> 29:03.865
However, Daniel...

29:05.073 --> 29:07.398
I can't be court-martialled, sir.

29:12.590 --> 29:15.627
Maybourne was here,
questioning my people.

29:15.590 --> 29:19.458
Wanted us to take some sort of tests.
And you expect me to trust you?

29:19.390 --> 29:23.518
He's from another division.
We're trying to protect you from him.

29:23.426 --> 29:25.752
You're not doing a very good job.

29:25.747 --> 29:27.453
No, apparently not.

29:29.826 --> 29:32.152
Do you have a new place for us to go?

29:32.465 --> 29:34.008
Well...

29:34.865 --> 29:36.109
no.

29:36.144 --> 29:38.980
Then we have nothing else to say.

29:38.943 --> 29:42.989
OK, I do know of a perfect place.
I just don't know how to get you there.

29:42.903 --> 29:45.857
Then, why do you speak of it?

29:45.823 --> 29:49.867
I was kinda hoping that maybe
you'd have a technology to get there.

29:52.261 --> 29:55.880
This is another trick
to gain access to our technology.

29:55.819 --> 30:00.896
No, it isn't. There was a planet we went to
where people were as advanced as you.

30:00.778 --> 30:03.482
They were called the Nox.

30:03.458 --> 30:05.534
If you went there, why can't we?

30:05.537 --> 30:08.407
Well, because they felt about us
kinda like you do.

30:08.377 --> 30:11.912
They called us "very young",
which is more polite than "primitive",

30:11.855 --> 30:13.267
but same idea.

30:13.297 --> 30:17.757
They sealed their Stargate. I don't know
how to communicate with them to open it.

30:17.655 --> 30:22.567
- Do you know where this planet is?
- Yes, I have the coordinates right here.

30:22.453 --> 30:25.538
- We must go back to the mountaintop.
- Really?

30:25.493 --> 30:28.992
I can't. I can't get you out of here.

30:29.811 --> 30:31.887
That's not a problem.

30:33.250 --> 30:36.834
Right. Oh, but I have to go with you.

30:56.086 --> 30:59.205
- Give me your hand.
- What?

31:01.364 --> 31:03.440
Do you wish to come or not?

31:42.275 --> 31:44.351
The coordinates.

32:21.705 --> 32:23.035
I'm no astronomer,

32:23.065 --> 32:26.730
but won't that take thousands
of years to reach the Nox world?

32:26.663 --> 32:29.285
- Why would it?
- That's just a laser, right?

32:29.262 --> 32:33.391
I mean... light takes
a long time to travel that far.

32:44.980 --> 32:49.227
The distance between these two points...

32:50.698 --> 32:52.322
seems far,

32:53.857 --> 32:56.479
until you do this.

32:56.458 --> 32:59.576
OK, I remember this from college physics.

32:59.536 --> 33:04.661
One of our scientists, Einstein, explained
this the same way. Folding space.

33:05.934 --> 33:07.393
No.

33:08.174 --> 33:10.298
You wouldn't understand.

33:11.213 --> 33:13.420
No, I guess not.

33:13.413 --> 33:15.986
I just hope the Nox do.

33:43.246 --> 33:45.488
<i>Samantha?</i>

33:45.486 --> 33:46.767
Narim?

33:52.523 --> 33:53.721
Hello.

33:54.563 --> 33:56.805
Oh, my God. How do you do that?

33:56.804 --> 33:58.961
Very... carefully.

34:03.960 --> 34:07.875
I have come to say goodbye.
We'll be leaving soon.

34:07.799 --> 34:10.717
So you think Daniel's plan will work?

34:10.679 --> 34:13.516
Either way, I will be leaving.

34:13.478 --> 34:16.349
However, I... will go reluctantly.

34:17.918 --> 34:20.076
Why?

34:20.077 --> 34:23.411
Because as of tonight
we will never meet again.

34:23.356 --> 34:26.358
Come on. You'll forget
about me in a heartbeat.

34:28.195 --> 34:30.271
I thought you felt that way.

34:32.155 --> 34:36.483
- That is why I brought you this.
- What is it?

34:36.393 --> 34:38.766
You have audio and visual
recording devices?

34:38.753 --> 34:39.784
Yeah.

34:39.831 --> 34:42.583
This one records emotions.

34:42.552 --> 34:45.257
My feelings for you.

34:45.231 --> 34:48.646
I have worn it
each time we were together.

34:50.829 --> 34:53.498
How does it work?

34:53.469 --> 34:56.090
Touch the red triangle.

34:59.789 --> 35:01.996
And close your eyes.

35:24.461 --> 35:26.833
I don't know what to say.

35:27.780 --> 35:29.856
We have a custom

35:34.338 --> 35:36.414
that expresses more than words.

35:50.735 --> 35:52.858
We have that custom, too.

36:01.972 --> 36:03.798
Whoops.

36:03.811 --> 36:06.849
Sorry. We've gotta do some stuff in here.

36:08.050 --> 36:10.340
Actually, I need your help.

36:11.889 --> 36:16.635
You should probably get going.
Don't forget Schrรถdinger.

36:24.487 --> 36:25.864
Thank you.

36:46.123 --> 36:49.657
I'll need at least one unit of escorts
in the rear transport.

36:50.681 --> 36:52.010
Come.

36:52.041 --> 36:56.121
General Hammond, sir, the refugees...
they've disappeared.

36:56.039 --> 36:57.699
What do you mean?

36:57.719 --> 37:01.420
I mean... like "poof", sir.
They went through the walls.

37:01.360 --> 37:04.396
I told you to keep guards inside
to prevent that.

37:04.358 --> 37:06.978
We were inside.
I stood in their path myself.

37:06.958 --> 37:10.409
- And?
- They went right through me, sir.

37:11.556 --> 37:16.550
<i>Attention, all personnel.
Offworld activation, unknown source.</i>

37:23.514 --> 37:25.056
What the hell is going on?

37:25.074 --> 37:29.534
The mainframe's having a nervous
breakdown. The iris is failing.

37:29.431 --> 37:32.432
Why is the blast door down? Get it up.

37:34.831 --> 37:37.038
What are they doing?
How did they get here?

37:37.030 --> 37:39.983
The gate's dialling. Chevron six engaged.

37:39.949 --> 37:42.701
Dr. Jackson, this is Colonel Maybourne.

37:42.668 --> 37:45.835
What you are doing is
a court-martiallable offence.

37:47.108 --> 37:48.981
He's not in the military.

37:48.987 --> 37:53.364
And I think it'd be kinda tough
to find a civilian law to cover this.

37:55.264 --> 37:58.965
I'll have you removed from this
programme for ever if you do this!

37:58.905 --> 38:01.360
<i>Chevron seven is locked.</i>

38:06.023 --> 38:08.394
Wherever you send them,
we'll hunt them down.

38:08.382 --> 38:12.545
We're not sending them anywhere.
The gate was activated offworld.

38:12.461 --> 38:15.664
- Someone is sending for them.
- Who?

38:33.416 --> 38:35.326
Hello.

38:37.096 --> 38:39.172
Hello, Lya.

38:40.534 --> 38:42.409
This is Colonel Maybourne.

38:42.414 --> 38:46.329
I have a presidential order to take
the aliens! Do not let them pass!

38:46.253 --> 38:48.541
Use force if necessary!

38:51.693 --> 38:54.313
Your race has learned nothing.

38:57.530 --> 38:59.606
But you have.

39:01.650 --> 39:05.184
The Tollans are most welcome
to join the Nox. Please come.

39:13.686 --> 39:16.012
Narim was right about you.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.438
Perhaps in time, we'll meet again.

39:28.445 --> 39:29.476
Stop!

39:31.563 --> 39:35.512
Take one more step, and I'll be
forced to have them open fire.

39:50.119 --> 39:51.577
Come.

39:58.556 --> 40:00.016
Fire! Fire!

40:10.273 --> 40:12.349
God, I love those people.

40:44.065 --> 40:46.521
You did good, Daniel.

40:47.103 --> 40:50.139
- What of Maybourne?
- Oh, he's not a happy camper.

40:50.105 --> 40:54.054
There'll be hell to pay
when he gets back to Washington.

40:56.782 --> 40:57.945
What?

40:57.983 --> 41:02.146
Just thinking what the little guy
with funny hair once told us.

41:03.340 --> 41:07.172
"The very young do not
always do as they're told."

41:07.099 --> 41:08.297
Yeah.
