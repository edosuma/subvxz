13:53.220 --> 13:57.987
My hand. Take my damn hand.

14:04.532 --> 14:07.228
I'll never see <i>Vertigo</i> again.

14:07.601 --> 14:10.297
Your Honor, if you don't mind,
I'd like to be alone.

14:10.471 --> 14:12.405
This is my private spot.

14:12.573 --> 14:16.065
I got an idea. Let's hit the cafeteria.
They got food. They got hot coffee.

14:16.243 --> 14:17.835
They got a ceiling.

14:18.012 --> 14:19.639
I'd stay here, sir.

14:19.814 --> 14:21.839
It's so peaceful.

14:22.016 --> 14:24.246
A man can think.

14:25.686 --> 14:28.450
WOMAN:
What's that up there?

14:28.622 --> 14:30.886
[CRASHING]

14:31.759 --> 14:35.855
Maybe you better come back here
for humanitarian reasons, huh?

14:36.831 --> 14:38.924
If you're gonna lecture me,
get it over with.

14:39.099 --> 14:40.828
I'm not gonna lecture you, Bull.

14:42.069 --> 14:46.028
Okay, but it's a real short one.
Now, when I saw you two together...

14:46.207 --> 14:48.971
...I could tell that you were real happy
with each other.

14:49.143 --> 14:51.839
- It's just not the same anymore.
- Well, it is for her.

14:52.012 --> 14:53.604
She needs a father in her life.

14:53.781 --> 14:56.443
Wasn't it pretty obvious
how much it meant to her?

14:56.617 --> 14:59.211
I don't know anything about girls,
Your Honor.

14:59.620 --> 15:02.783
They don't do the same stuff boys do.

15:04.091 --> 15:08.050
They always make those little circles
over the I's when they write letters.

15:09.597 --> 15:12.464
They go to the bathroom in groups.

15:13.868 --> 15:15.301
And they have...

15:15.469 --> 15:16.868
You know, they have...

15:17.037 --> 15:18.800
- Peaks and valleys?
- Thank you.

15:18.973 --> 15:24.172
Yeah. And sometimes they get a raw deal
out of life just like boys do.

15:26.780 --> 15:29.647
I just can't do the same things
with her, Harry.

15:30.150 --> 15:33.847
Come on,
that's not the important stuff, Bull.

15:48.936 --> 15:52.337
We were gonna write our names

Candy? That you, honey?

MAC [IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]:
No, dear, it's just me.

16:18.065 --> 16:19.555
Oh.

16:24.471 --> 16:27.065
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
You really feel that bad about the game?

16:28.108 --> 16:29.166
Ah!

16:30.678 --> 16:33.408
No, don't bother getting up.
I'm sure it's nothing.

16:33.580 --> 16:35.275
Listen.

16:35.482 --> 16:37.416
You want those tickets,
you can have them.

16:37.985 --> 16:39.612
Really?

16:40.587 --> 16:42.316
That's great, Mac.

16:42.489 --> 16:44.957
Thank you so much. What a pal.

16:45.159 --> 16:47.593
- I gonna have to charge you.
- Yes, indeed, of course.

16:47.761 --> 16:51.458
Danny would not expect a freebie,
not for something this big.

16:51.632 --> 16:53.497
No way. Okay, how much?

16:53.667 --> 16:55.567
A thousand dollars.

16:57.705 --> 17:01.163
- A thousand dollars?
- Grandpa really wanted to see that game.

17:01.342 --> 17:04.140
A thousand American dollars?

17:04.310 --> 17:06.472
Course, if you found tickets
someplace else...

17:06.646 --> 17:07.944
No.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.342
I'll pay it.

17:16.256 --> 17:17.883
- That was...
- A thousand.

17:18.058 --> 17:21.425
Yeah, yeah. Just checking.

17:29.670 --> 17:31.661
You have a good time, now, you hear?

You bet I will.

17:38.178 --> 17:40.373
I've got binoculars
in my desk if you want them.

17:40.547 --> 17:42.811
- Hey, that's great. Thanks.
- Ten dollars.

17:45.252 --> 17:47.277
- Say what?
- To rent the binoculars.

17:47.454 --> 17:49.285
You have got to be kidding.

17:49.456 --> 17:53.187
Oh, but there's a sale over at the
sporting-goods store right across the street.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.955
You can pick up a pair just like mine
for $89.95.

18:06.473 --> 18:09.806
So you want the parking pass,
or you gonna take her on the bus?

18:14.314 --> 18:19.183
Mom's been dating now and then, but if
they're single, they're creeps or they're dull.

18:19.353 --> 18:21.685
- Tell me about it.
- Tell me about it.

18:23.991 --> 18:25.822
- How's Bull?
- Well, we talked.

18:25.993 --> 18:27.324
He hates me, right?

18:27.494 --> 18:30.088
Actually, I don't think it's in Bull
to hate anyone.

18:30.264 --> 18:33.358
Though I am filling him in
on Barry Manilow.

18:35.436 --> 18:37.336
- Honey?
- Oh, hi, Mom.

18:37.504 --> 18:39.938
What's going on?
Are you in some kind of trouble?

18:40.107 --> 18:43.406
- What on earth have you done to your hair?
- I'm Judge Stone.

18:43.577 --> 18:46.375
Hello. I've got 32 more questions.

18:46.547 --> 18:49.516
Do any of them involve your girl
pretending to be a boy?

18:50.951 --> 18:52.816
Thirty-three.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.849
Mom, I got a volunteer father.

18:56.023 --> 18:57.115
I beg your pardon?

18:57.658 --> 18:59.125
I got a father.

18:59.293 --> 19:02.558
We played basketball in the park,
and he helped me with my homework.

19:02.729 --> 19:03.718
Uh.

19:03.897 --> 19:07.731
- Are you okay?
- I have this problem with sudden shocks.

19:08.902 --> 19:10.927
There he is, Ma.

19:13.774 --> 19:15.639
Good example.

19:17.411 --> 19:19.174
Bull, wait.

19:24.384 --> 19:26.511
I just wanted to say goodbye.

19:27.788 --> 19:30.780
That's okay. I understand.

19:31.191 --> 19:34.092
It's like buying something
and discovering when you get home...

19:34.261 --> 19:37.094
...that they put the wrong thing in the box,
isn't it?

19:59.786 --> 20:04.485
Well, listen, I'd like to apologize
if any of this has been an inconvenience.

20:04.658 --> 20:08.492
Of course,
I don't know what any of this is.

20:08.896 --> 20:10.022
It's no problem.

20:10.197 --> 20:13.325
In fact, we kind of liked
having Andy around.

20:13.500 --> 20:17.095
- Andy?
- It was either that or Opie.

20:19.540 --> 20:20.837

you were a girl because...

Bull, I was gonna tell you, I swear.

20:54.241 --> 20:58.007
I mean, we would have gone swimming.
It would have been hard to explain my suit.

20:58.178 --> 21:00.043
- Shut up.
- Yes, sir.

21:04.451 --> 21:06.419
I went funny in the head...

21:09.022 --> 21:11.718
...because all I'd been thinking about
was myself.

21:13.427 --> 21:15.486
How I'd act with a son.

21:15.662 --> 21:19.063
How I'd be the envy of all the guys
who didn't have one.

21:21.001 --> 21:22.969
How I'd feel good
when we were together.

21:25.339 --> 21:27.307
Somewhere along the way...

21:27.474 --> 21:30.671
...I forgot all about the kid
I was supposed to be helping.

21:31.645 --> 21:35.809
- But you wanted a son.
- I wanted someone to take care of.

21:36.550 --> 21:41.510
I know now it doesn't matter
if that someone is a boy or a girl...

21:41.955 --> 21:43.718
...or a toad.

21:45.325 --> 21:49.284
So is that someone
anywhere around here?

21:49.863 --> 21:52.331
She couldn't be any closer.

21:57.638 --> 22:01.734
If he hadn't said "toad," I'd be in tears.

22:12.686 --> 22:14.847
- Great news.
- Great news. You first.

22:15.022 --> 22:18.480
My brother went to school with one
of the Jets, and he got me a field pass.

22:18.659 --> 22:20.957
- What's yours?
- I'm gonna go buy a big shovel...

22:21.128 --> 22:24.120
...and beat myself in the head
until I'm bloody.
