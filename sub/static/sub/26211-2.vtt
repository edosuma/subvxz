and then he stormed out
of the van.

41:46.266 --> 41:47.533
- You seemed upset about it
earlier.

41:47.567 --> 41:49.500
- Well, I'm upset with the way

41:49.533 --> 41:51.166
that it went down,
because I feel like

41:51.200 --> 41:53.433
I was disrespected
by Chandler.

41:53.467 --> 41:56.133
- You just straight-up
lost your sh--.

41:56.166 --> 41:58.000
- [laughing]
- I'm just telling you

41:58.033 --> 42:00.000
right now, we're...
- I got it!

42:00.033 --> 42:01.367
I'm--I understand...
- Okay.

42:01.400 --> 42:02.700
- I said to you
in the ----ing van

42:02.700 --> 42:04.500
and I said it
just five minutes ago,

42:04.533 --> 42:06.367
I will do what you've
asked me to do.

42:06.400 --> 42:09.567
Sorry to speak while you're
----ing interrupting.

42:09.567 --> 42:11.567
- I don't know
who Rhylee thinks she is.

42:11.567 --> 42:13.700
I've never dealt with this kind

42:13.700 --> 42:16.667
of disrespect before,
and I will not put up with it.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.700
[dramatic music]

42:19.734 --> 42:22.467
- Next, on "Below Deck"...
- You don't have to like me,

42:22.500 --> 42:24.600
but you will respect me.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.734
- [hyperventilating]

42:26.767 --> 42:28.600
- What the hell?
- Caroline?

42:28.633 --> 42:30.600
- Primaries:
Allen and Danielle.

42:30.633 --> 42:33.300
The last couple of times,
they haven't had a great time.

42:33.333 --> 42:35.467
We need to nail this.

42:35.467 --> 42:37.600
We're coming into
a little squall area, here.

42:37.600 --> 42:41.734
[indistinct chatter]

42:41.767 --> 42:44.600
- Ooh, veal?
- You don't eat baby animals?

42:44.633 --> 42:46.467
- I want to swim.
- I don't think swimming's

42:46.500 --> 42:48.200
in the works for right now.

42:48.233 --> 42:50.200
- Um, if you guys are like--
10 to 15 minutes,

42:50.200 --> 42:51.467
then we'll be fine.

42:51.467 --> 42:53.066
You're a junior deckhand.

42:53.066 --> 42:54.734
Just shut up.
- I'm also a boat captain.

42:54.767 --> 42:56.166
- All right, let's talk
about this later.

42:56.200 --> 42:57.567
- Yes, sir.
- This behavior

42:57.600 --> 42:59.200
can't be tolerated.
It's not my place to say

42:59.200 --> 43:01.200
what I'm about to say, but...

43:01.233 --> 43:02.734
[dramatic music]

43:02.767 --> 43:14.000
