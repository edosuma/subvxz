19:14.753 --> 19:16.704
HE HAD A HEART ATTACK.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.805
IT'LL BE MONTHS BEFORE
HE'S BACK TO NORMAL.

19:18.841 --> 19:20.307

20:09.675 --> 20:10.775
I WON'T HAVE IT.

20:10.810 --> 20:11.642
YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS?

20:11.678 --> 20:13.711
UH... [sighs]

20:17.433 --> 20:18.799
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

20:18.835 --> 20:20.934
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING WRONG WITH ME.

20:20.970 --> 20:21.735
I'M AS STRONG

20:28.010 --> 20:29.826
SAME WAY I'VE ALWAYS
DONE IT.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.862
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.330
MARY'S JUST A GIRL.

20:33.365 --> 20:34.498
OHH!

20:34.533 --> 20:36.450
OH, PHHH!

20:36.485 --> 20:38.085
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.621
SHE'S TOO YOUNG.
SHE'S TOO HEADSTRONG.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.789
SHE'S--
SHE'S TOO IMPULSIVE.

20:42.824 --> 20:44.291
UH, HELLO,
I'M IN THE ROOM.

20:44.327 --> 20:48.028
SHE'S THE SAME AGE

JUST FORGET IT.

20:49.816 --> 20:50.548
IT'S NO USE.
HE'LL NEVER CHANGE.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.315
WHY SHOULD I CHANGE?

20:51.350 --> 20:54.985
I'VE BEEN DOING
THIS SINCE LONG
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.770
CHRISTMAS IS A BIG
RESPONSIBILITY, MARY.

20:56.805 --> 20:58.873
FRANKLY,
YOU'RE NOT UP TO IT.

20:58.908 --> 21:01.909
UP TO IT? DAD,
I RUN MY OWN COMPANY.

21:01.944 --> 21:04.078
PEOPLE PAY ME
TO TELL THEM

21:04.113 --> 21:04.878
HOW TO RUN
THEIR BUSINESS
MORE EFFICIENTLY.

21:04.914 --> 21:05.479
OH, AND I SUPPOSE
YOU TELL THEM,

21:05.514 --> 21:09.633
"JUST CHANGE EVERYTHING.
JUST FORGET ABOUT
TRADITION."

21:09.668 --> 21:13.437
DAD, THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BEING TRADITIONAL
AND BEING PRIMITIVE.

21:54.881 --> 21:57.398
A LIFETIME OF MY IDEAS--

21:57.433 --> 22:00.768

01:23:19.344 --> 01:23:22.445
WELL...

01:23:22.481 --> 01:23:23.964
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

01:23:25.301 --> 01:23:27.368
MORNING, DAD.

01:23:33.843 --> 01:23:35.909
WELL, YOU WERE
KIND OF ON THE FENCE

01:23:35.945 --> 01:23:38.361

THING FOR A WHILE.

01:23:38.396 --> 01:23:41.431
BUT YOU PULLED THROUGH.

01:23:41.467 --> 01:23:43.833
I JUST...

01:23:43.869 --> 01:23:46.753
I WANTED CHRISTMAS
TO BE PERFECT.

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:49.489
OH, WHEN IS CHRISTMAS
EVER PERFECT?

01:23:49.524 --> 01:23:51.658
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
A LONG TIME,

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:53.460
AND I HAVEN'T
GOTTEN IT RIGHT YET.

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:55.128
REALLY?

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:56.780
YOU?

01:23:56.815 --> 01:23:59.416
EVERY YEAR,
IT'S SOMETHING--

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:01.284
RUN OUT OF TRICYCLES,

01:24:01.319 --> 01:24:03.620
FORGET BELGIUM...

01:24:03.656 --> 01:24:04.871
BUT THIS CHRISTMAS?

01:24:04.907 --> 01:24:07.474
