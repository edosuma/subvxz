00:02.237 --> 00:03.904
What?

00:08.506 --> 00:10.610
Happy birthday, baby boy.

00:11.373 --> 00:13.513
Happy birthday, buddy.

00:15.281 --> 00:16.749
Wait.

00:16.751 --> 00:17.650
Make a wish.

00:19.654 --> 00:21.420
One, two..

00:22.889 --> 00:24.356
Ooh.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.559
Yay!

00:26.561 --> 00:29.127
Good job, honey.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.629
You got him to his first year.

00:30.631 --> 00:31.730
A toast to the parents.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.700
- Thank you.
- Well...

00:34.702 --> 00:36.368
Well, we didn't drop him on his head.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.702
Didn't swallow a safety pin.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.671
We did it.

00:49.115 --> 00:50.748
What are looking at?

00:53.152 --> 00:55.520
I don't know. I'm just thinking.

00:55.522 --> 00:57.622
It's Luke's birthday today.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.991
Right. That's right.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.525
You had him...

01:02.227 --> 01:03.895
Same day that Joel died.

01:04.876 --> 01:06.993
Birthday, death day, I...

01:07.810 --> 01:10.334
I'm not really sure how
I'm supposed to feel.

01:11.277 --> 01:14.894
Your kid is happy and healthy.
that's all that matters.

01:15.108 --> 01:16.007
True.

01:16.224 --> 01:17.909
I should probably get to work.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.777
How are you doing?

01:20.358 --> 01:21.271
I'm good.

01:21.321 --> 01:22.079
You know me.

01:22.578 --> 01:24.848
I'm not that big
on celebrating anniversaries.

01:24.927 --> 01:26.078
Ask my ex.

01:27.711 --> 01:30.154
Well, if you ever
want to talk about it...

01:32.420 --> 01:33.789
Happy birthday to Luke.

01:33.792 --> 01:35.025
Thank you.

01:45.449 --> 01:46.641
Oh!

01:47.715 --> 01:49.057
Good morning.

01:49.107 --> 01:51.762
Good morning.
Have you had breakfast yet?

01:52.015 --> 01:54.077
Why would I need breakfast when I have you?

01:54.079 --> 01:56.884
You saying I'm the most
important meal of the day?

01:57.034 --> 02:00.005
I am. And the most elusive.

02:00.305 --> 02:02.685
We've kind of been like two ships.

02:02.913 --> 02:04.939
My budget is due in less than a month.

02:04.989 --> 02:07.523
I know,
which is why you need a break.

02:07.906 --> 02:11.056
My buddy Paul's giving us his cottage
on Rosseau for the weekend.

02:11.195 --> 02:12.594
Are you kidding me?

02:12.596 --> 02:14.764
Dust off your flip-flops, Dr. Bell.

02:14.766 --> 02:18.000
We're going to cottage country.

02:18.002 --> 02:19.301
Dawn here.

02:21.038 --> 02:23.172
Yes. That is great news.

02:23.174 --> 02:25.274
Okay. Yeah. I'll be right up.

02:25.276 --> 02:28.944
A donor heart just became
available for a patient of mine.

02:28.946 --> 02:31.646
Looks like I'm doing a transplant today.

02:31.648 --> 02:34.549
Adios, flip-flops, just like that.

02:34.551 --> 02:36.818
Oh, Lane, I'm so sorry. I...

02:36.820 --> 02:38.219
For saving a life?

02:38.637 --> 02:40.443
Don't be.

02:41.558 --> 02:42.590
Can I watch?

02:42.592 --> 02:44.993
Can I watch you do the transplant?

02:44.995 --> 02:47.729
That is against hospital policy.

02:47.731 --> 02:50.298
I know. I was on the board
that made the policy.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.399
Exactly. So, what would we say to the staff?

02:52.401 --> 02:54.068
Whatever we want.

02:54.070 --> 02:55.681
I mean, what's the point
of having a little power

02:55.731 --> 02:57.370
if we can't use it, right?

02:58.869 --> 02:59.847
What do you have?

02:59.897 --> 03:02.832
Taylor Fenn, 16 years old,
motocross champion.

03:02.882 --> 03:04.607
- Motocross?
- Yeah.

03:05.088 --> 03:06.275
Hi. I'm Dr. Reid.

03:06.325 --> 03:08.050
Hi. Nancy Fenn. Hi.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.349
Hi, Taylor. You can call me Alex.

03:09.351 --> 03:10.884
So, you race motorbikes?

03:10.886 --> 03:11.718
Yeah.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.152
These bruises look old.

03:13.154 --> 03:15.689
Uh, they're from a race
in Fort Erie last month.

03:15.691 --> 03:17.595
Missed the landing on the whip. Ate it hard.

03:17.645 --> 03:19.587
Bet you got a nice soil sample though.

03:19.637 --> 03:21.745
Yeah, but I didn't even cry.

03:21.795 --> 03:24.813
She's always covered in bruises,
but this fall she just took.

03:24.863 --> 03:27.634
Jammed the handlebars into
my stomach pretty good.

03:27.636 --> 03:28.835
I thought I should bring her in.

03:28.837 --> 03:31.555
Good idea. I'm just gonna
feel your belly, okay?

03:33.522 --> 03:34.806
Severe abdominal bruising.

03:34.808 --> 03:37.409
Oh, that looks way worse already.

03:37.411 --> 03:38.711
Ow!

03:38.713 --> 03:40.312
Taylor, how long have you been racing?

03:40.314 --> 03:43.515
I got my first ktm when I was 9. Aah!

03:43.517 --> 03:45.351
Localized tenderness in
the upper left quadrant.

03:45.353 --> 03:47.022
- Her systolic just bottomed out.
- What does that mean?

03:47.072 --> 03:48.352
Taylor, I'm gonna need
you to listen to my voice

03:48.402 --> 03:49.914
- and stay with me, okay?
- Oh, I feels so...

03:49.964 --> 03:51.865
Taylor? Taylor? Drop her head.

03:51.915 --> 03:53.878
- Honey?
- She's got to have internal bleeding.

03:53.928 --> 03:55.593
We'll need to get her into the O.R. now.

03:55.595 --> 03:56.729
- Mom, I'm gonna ask you to move away.
- Okay.

03:56.779 --> 03:57.790
- All right, Taylor.
- Mom?

03:57.840 --> 03:59.606
Honey, it's okay. I'm right here.

04:00.066 --> 04:01.031
Yeah.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.233
You two are in my E.R. today?

04:02.235 --> 04:03.901
- Yes, sir.
- At your service.

04:04.128 --> 04:06.537
- Have either of you actually operated?
- I have.

04:06.587 --> 04:07.140
What about you?

04:07.190 --> 04:08.806
I came really close yesterday.

04:08.808 --> 04:10.975
Close only counts in
horseshoes and hand grenades.

04:10.977 --> 04:12.376
Are you guys ready for this?

04:12.378 --> 04:13.978
You take the bag? What do we got?

04:13.980 --> 04:15.279
Bryn Stewart, 32,

04:15.281 --> 04:17.584
single penetrating gunshot
wound to the temporal lobe.

04:17.634 --> 04:19.399
- That's my daughter.
- Oh, sir, I'm sorry.

04:19.450 --> 04:20.598
You're gonna have to stay out here.

04:20.648 --> 04:22.277
- I want to be with her. I'm her father.
- No, no, Dr. Williams,

04:22.327 --> 04:23.072
Dr. Williams, it's okay.

04:23.122 --> 04:24.252
It's okay. You can come in and join.

04:24.302 --> 04:25.690
- Just stay clear while we work, okay?
- Thank you.

04:25.742 --> 04:26.823
Can you tell me what happened?

04:26.880 --> 04:28.492
Uh, I found her.

04:28.494 --> 04:29.994
I think she may have shot herself.

04:29.996 --> 04:31.995
I don't even know where she found a gun.

04:32.997 --> 04:34.140
Zach.

04:34.190 --> 04:34.849
Gunshot.

04:34.899 --> 04:38.334
B.P.'s 155 over 90. Pulse is steady.

04:42.688 --> 04:44.473
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

04:44.556 --> 04:45.513
What does that mean?

04:45.606 --> 04:48.106
It means her brain isn't sending
the responses it should be.

04:48.156 --> 04:50.698
Okay. I got multiple skull fractures here.

04:50.781 --> 04:53.332
I need to see her spine. Let's roll her.

04:53.583 --> 04:55.450
On three. One, two, three.

05:01.357 --> 05:02.624
Okay.

05:03.572 --> 05:06.128
Dr. Williams, check her motor responses.

05:08.664 --> 05:09.965
What are you doing to her now?

05:09.967 --> 05:12.767
I'm checking to see if she has any feeling.

05:12.769 --> 05:13.802
Zero response.

05:13.804 --> 05:15.102
Let's get her up to imaging.

05:15.104 --> 05:17.004
I need to get a better
sense of her injuries.

05:17.006 --> 05:18.542
She's still alive, though, right?

05:18.592 --> 05:20.875
I mean, she's still breathing.

05:20.877 --> 05:23.845
A machine is breathing for her, yes.

05:24.435 --> 05:26.648
Cassie, will you take Mr. Stewart

05:26.650 --> 05:28.115
to somewhere
a little more private, please?

05:28.117 --> 05:29.522
She's gonna pull through. I know it.

05:29.594 --> 05:30.474
She's a fighter.

05:30.551 --> 05:33.187
Yes. She is in very good hands.

05:33.459 --> 05:35.265
Okay, guys, let's get her up to imaging and

05:35.333 --> 05:36.924
do a comprehensive apnea test.

05:39.255 --> 05:41.628
Why am I still here?

05:43.870 --> 05:45.474
Don't know.

05:46.592 --> 05:49.003
So, hell continues.

05:50.411 --> 05:54.274
Great. That is just great.

06:00.066 --> 06:02.415
Okay, I'm trying to pack it off,
but the blood just keeps coming.

06:02.417 --> 06:03.483
Suction.

06:03.485 --> 06:05.451
It's the spleen. It's completely mulched.

06:05.453 --> 06:06.652
Clamp.

06:06.654 --> 06:10.723
Clamping the splenic hilum.
Give me those scissors.

06:13.126 --> 06:14.726
Let's get this guy out of here.

06:14.728 --> 06:15.727
Mm-hmm.

06:15.729 --> 06:17.529
Here it comes. Ready?

06:19.366 --> 06:21.100
Wow. It is huge.

06:21.102 --> 06:23.202
That is twice the normal size.

06:23.204 --> 06:25.204
Uh, we have another problem.

06:25.206 --> 06:27.106
- What?
- She's hypotensive?

06:27.108 --> 06:28.008
Well, hang more blood.

06:28.058 --> 06:30.952
I'm trying, but clearly she isn't clotting.

06:31.002 --> 06:32.543
Autoimmune disease?

06:32.545 --> 06:33.953
Wouldn't explain the size of the spleen.

06:34.003 --> 06:36.214
Toxoplasmosis? Sarcoidosis?

06:36.216 --> 06:38.049
Both could cause enlarged spleen.

06:38.051 --> 06:41.386
Uh, her white blood count is off the charts.

06:43.522 --> 06:44.889
Leukemia?

06:45.451 --> 06:46.490
She was covered in bruises,

06:46.492 --> 06:48.192
but I thought it was from
the motorcycle accident.

06:48.194 --> 06:50.295
- If it's leukemia...
- Then we got to close her up

06:50.297 --> 06:52.229
and get her out of here before we kill her.

07:01.885 --> 07:04.477
All right, team,
our patient today is George Follows.

07:04.527 --> 07:08.310
He is an active 46-year-old father of three,

07:08.312 --> 07:10.613
but he has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

07:10.615 --> 07:13.581
For those of you who might not be familiar,

07:13.583 --> 07:17.285
that means that the muscles
in his heart have stiffened,

07:17.287 --> 07:18.920
impeding the blood flow.

07:18.922 --> 07:21.931
But we have a healthy new
heart from a 26-year-old male

07:21.981 --> 07:23.659
who is no longer with us.

07:23.737 --> 07:25.593
And we thank him.

07:26.101 --> 07:28.647
And this is Lane Berkley.
He's a member of the board.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.986
And her new boy toy.

07:31.793 --> 07:36.455
He is here to observe
this operation, to, um...

07:37.123 --> 07:39.567
To, uh, review the standard of practice

07:39.617 --> 07:42.711
for the surgical subcommittee
that I'm currently chairing.

07:42.761 --> 07:44.434
Unless, of course, anyone objects.

07:44.484 --> 07:45.831
Oh, the more, the merrier.

07:45.881 --> 07:47.741
I'm just happy to be here myself.

07:47.839 --> 07:50.312
Okay, well,
I'll just stay out of the way and

07:50.385 --> 07:52.729
let y'all do what y'all do.

07:56.566 --> 08:00.258
They declared me brain-dead
a little while ago.

08:05.541 --> 08:08.945
Yeah. I heard. I'm sorry.

08:09.908 --> 08:12.459
I always thought I'd be the
one to watch him die.

08:12.509 --> 08:13.706
Doctor, can you tell me

08:13.756 --> 08:15.874
how long it'll be
before you try waking her up?

08:16.262 --> 08:17.576
Mr. Stewart, um...

08:19.046 --> 08:22.248
I'm not sure waking her
up is gonna be possible.

08:22.378 --> 08:23.770
Yes, it is.

08:24.029 --> 08:26.219
And I'm gonna be here when she does.

08:36.831 --> 08:38.898
We got unlucky this
morning with that suicide.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.777
But I got a new game plan. Who's with me?

08:40.827 --> 08:42.332
Do we get to hear the plan first,

08:42.336 --> 08:43.702
or do we have to commit now?

08:43.703 --> 08:47.305
The new game plan is...
no one else dies today,

08:47.307 --> 08:50.442
not in our E.R., not on our watch. Yeah?

08:50.444 --> 08:51.509
- Sure.
- Absolutely.

08:51.511 --> 08:52.297
Great.

08:52.359 --> 08:54.108
I got a really good feeling about you two.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.727
We are going to crush this.

08:55.777 --> 08:57.243
- Are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

08:57.378 --> 08:58.739
Children, gather.

08:58.837 --> 09:01.186
This is Doug Renfroe, okay?
He was in a car accident.

09:01.259 --> 09:04.122
He having abdominal trauma
and possible concussion.

09:04.124 --> 09:05.823
Cassie, run a F.A.S.T., please.

09:05.825 --> 09:06.858
Doctor.

09:06.860 --> 09:11.529
Hello, sir. My name is Dr. Sekara.

09:11.531 --> 09:12.464
I'm doug.

09:12.466 --> 09:14.999
You were in an accident, Mr. Renfroe?

09:15.001 --> 09:15.900
Yeah.

09:15.902 --> 09:17.315
S.U.V. came out of nowhere.

09:17.365 --> 09:18.769
Where were you hit?

09:18.831 --> 09:19.971
In the car?

09:21.661 --> 09:23.076
Those were stupid questions.

09:23.126 --> 09:24.476
No. You're just going through the checklist.

09:24.478 --> 09:25.278
It's good to be thorough.

09:25.328 --> 09:27.167
F.A.S.T. is clear. No free fluids.

09:27.217 --> 09:30.347
Good. Check his light reflex.

09:36.916 --> 09:39.179
Pupils are equal and responsive.

09:39.229 --> 09:41.692
All right. Looks like today's
your lucky today, Mr. Renfroe.

09:41.742 --> 09:44.428
Sure doesn't feel like it.

09:45.050 --> 09:45.562
You know what?

09:45.564 --> 09:46.809
Let's send him up to
imaging just to be sure.

09:46.859 --> 09:48.620
I want to get a head and chest C.T.

09:48.670 --> 09:49.743
Remember our pact.

09:49.872 --> 09:50.954
All right. I'll call for an orderly.

09:51.004 --> 09:52.835
No, no. You guys will do it yourself.

09:52.837 --> 09:56.238
Diligence, people, diligence.

09:58.542 --> 10:01.511
Is this your first time seeing it up close?

10:06.051 --> 10:06.938
What's happening?

10:06.988 --> 10:07.910
The pump stopped.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.442
Yeah. I can see that. Tim?

10:09.520 --> 10:11.072
We have a venous airlock.

10:11.122 --> 10:13.400
- What can I do?
- Hold this.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.315
Okay, we need to lift the tube,
get the air out.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.992
Move, please.

10:20.530 --> 10:22.973
Hang in there, George.

10:26.961 --> 10:28.774
Okay, bubble's gone.

10:28.939 --> 10:30.290
SATs are still dropping.

10:30.414 --> 10:31.739
Why isn't the pump turning on?

10:31.789 --> 10:32.422
Give me a minute.

10:32.515 --> 10:34.491
Yeah. I don't have a minute.

10:37.135 --> 10:38.612
Well, that seemed to work.

10:38.614 --> 10:40.281
Very impressive, Dr. Bell.

10:41.953 --> 10:42.917
First rule of surgery...

10:42.919 --> 10:45.253
it's better to be lucky than good.

10:45.255 --> 10:47.065
I will put a new pump in the budget.

10:47.115 --> 10:47.624
Thank you.

10:47.674 --> 10:50.023
And I need to re-glove.

11:01.114 --> 11:03.403
It's bad news, isn't it?

11:04.296 --> 11:07.934
Taylor, you have something
called acute myeloid leukemia.

11:09.408 --> 11:11.198
Oh, no.

11:11.266 --> 11:15.514
Um, what does...
what does that actually mean?

11:15.516 --> 11:17.356
It means that your bone marrow cells

11:17.406 --> 11:19.824
aren't maturing the way
that they're supposed to.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.128
So, believe it or not,

11:21.178 --> 11:24.611
it's actually lucky that
you crashed on your bike.

11:24.730 --> 11:26.737
Yeah, lucky.

11:27.369 --> 11:30.049
Cancer. Super lucky.

11:30.272 --> 11:31.451
The sooner we know about it,

11:31.501 --> 11:33.014
the better chance we have to cure it.

11:33.216 --> 11:34.613
Um...

11:35.003 --> 11:38.214
Can I... can I still ride?

11:38.338 --> 11:39.663
Not for a while.

11:39.713 --> 11:41.479
We'll need to give you
induction chemotherapy

11:41.541 --> 11:43.041
and then a stem cell transplant,

11:43.043 --> 11:44.268
but that's further down the road.

11:44.325 --> 11:46.463
So, we do need a donor.

11:46.513 --> 11:49.055
Can mom be my donor?

11:49.316 --> 11:50.648
No. I'm sorry, Taylor.

11:50.650 --> 11:53.451
The results are back,
and your mother isn't a match.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.131
Am I gonna die?

11:58.181 --> 11:59.269
No.

12:00.236 --> 12:02.487
No, you're not.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.098
Oh, baby, it's okay to cry.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.501
You don't have to be so brave all the time.

12:14.572 --> 12:16.006
I'll give you some time.

12:16.008 --> 12:19.310
No. Can I... can I just talk
to you for a second privately?

12:19.312 --> 12:20.044
Of course.

12:20.094 --> 12:22.813
Honey, I'll be back in a second.

12:33.549 --> 12:35.542
I can't believe...

12:35.697 --> 12:38.879
this is just... it's too much.

12:39.536 --> 12:41.901
It's a lot to wrap your head around.

12:44.201 --> 12:46.237
I'm not her mother.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.880
She was my sister's kid.

12:52.012 --> 12:53.509
I've had her...

12:54.242 --> 12:56.581
I've had her since she was a baby.

12:57.315 --> 13:00.850
We didn't even ever know who the father was,

13:02.278 --> 13:05.952
and-and I don't even think
that she would remember her mo...

13:06.107 --> 13:07.255
Janice.

13:07.690 --> 13:08.924
Okay, then.

13:09.232 --> 13:11.364
We need to get your
sister in here right away.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.989
No, no, no.

13:13.123 --> 13:15.090
No, wait a minute.
You don't understand. My...

13:15.431 --> 13:17.573
My sister... she's a junkie.

13:18.205 --> 13:22.049
She's out for herself and
she always has been and I...

13:23.332 --> 13:26.670
I can't invite her into our lives.

13:26.753 --> 13:28.843
I understand that. I do.

13:29.035 --> 13:31.178
But leukemia progresses rapidly.

13:31.648 --> 13:33.909
We need to get
her biological mother in here

13:33.959 --> 13:35.078
as soon as possible.

13:35.177 --> 13:37.500
She's our best chance at
getting Taylor better.

13:38.675 --> 13:40.622
Okay.

13:51.233 --> 13:52.785
She's not gonna show.

13:52.918 --> 13:54.250
It's only five past.

13:54.451 --> 13:56.586
We keep this between us.

13:56.588 --> 13:59.310
Complete confidentiality.
Taylor never knows.

13:59.408 --> 14:02.260
Let's just take this one
step at a time, all right?

14:02.363 --> 14:03.258
Okay.

14:03.325 --> 14:05.307
Hey. What's going on?

14:05.357 --> 14:06.378
Where's Taylor?

14:06.664 --> 14:07.900
You must be Janice.

14:07.950 --> 14:09.090
This is Dr. Reid.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.341
Um, come on, Janice. Let's sit down.

14:11.469 --> 14:14.016
- No. Your phone call really freaked me out.
- Yeah, well, this isn't about you.

14:14.066 --> 14:15.165
It's about Taylor.

14:15.237 --> 14:18.383
She's been diagnosed with
an acute form of leukemia.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.278
She has cancer.

14:23.328 --> 14:24.582
Yes.

14:25.891 --> 14:27.749
Why didn't you tell me on the phone?

14:27.811 --> 14:28.991
Because I didn't know how you would react.

14:29.041 --> 14:30.108
You didn't know how I would react?

14:30.158 --> 14:33.290
- See? This is exactly what I was afraid of...
- Ladies, please.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.665
Janice, Taylor needs a stem cell transplant.

14:35.715 --> 14:37.653
We were hoping that you'd be a match.

14:37.751 --> 14:39.994
When's the last time you used?

14:41.632 --> 14:43.251
I'm clean.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.512
I will have to do a blood
test to verify that.

14:45.562 --> 14:46.216
Right.

14:46.266 --> 14:49.403
Okay? And I will also test
you for HIV, Hep B, C.

14:49.405 --> 14:52.172
It's standard protocol
for any potential donor.

14:52.498 --> 14:53.895
Sure.

14:53.945 --> 14:57.408
I'll do whatever
if it'll help my little girl.

14:57.590 --> 14:59.282
Thank you.

14:59.426 --> 15:00.684
Come on.

15:01.024 --> 15:02.428
Nancy?

15:02.857 --> 15:06.288
All right, people,
let's get this thing out of there.

15:06.769 --> 15:07.524
Dr. Lin?

15:07.597 --> 15:08.968
Ready, ready.

15:09.018 --> 15:10.423
Bucket.

15:15.938 --> 15:17.956
Lane, you okay?

15:18.233 --> 15:19.508
Lane! Oh!

15:19.558 --> 15:21.601
Somebody help him, please.

15:29.759 --> 15:31.839
I'm sorry you had to leave
the transplant surgery

15:31.889 --> 15:33.681
to come and stitch me up.

15:33.753 --> 15:35.192
Well, when the chief of surgery

15:35.270 --> 15:37.443
asks you to stitch up her boyfriend...

15:37.520 --> 15:38.884
You do what she says.

15:38.886 --> 15:39.756
That's right.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.303
Yeah, I guess we came up with that policy

15:41.353 --> 15:42.338
for a reason after all.

15:42.388 --> 15:43.657
Hold still.

15:46.229 --> 15:50.094
So, now I'm just gonna be a joke,

15:50.301 --> 15:52.599
a punch line in the doctor's lounge.

15:52.649 --> 15:54.182
Oh, trust me

15:54.401 --> 15:57.934
doctor's lounge gossip
has a short shelf life.

15:58.405 --> 16:00.004
So, uh

16:00.102 --> 16:02.896
did she say anything after I fainted?

16:02.946 --> 16:03.806
What do you mean?

16:03.915 --> 16:06.539
Well, I mean, did she laugh?

16:06.725 --> 16:10.771
No. Of course not.
She was just mostly concerned.

16:10.821 --> 16:12.205
Mm.

16:13.586 --> 16:15.219
It's gonna be fine.

16:15.361 --> 16:17.307
Seriously.

16:17.679 --> 16:18.828
I just need to know

16:18.878 --> 16:22.543
how expensive a makeup
gift I need to buy her.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.359
Any advice?

16:24.630 --> 16:26.797
You could try the hospital gift shop.

16:26.799 --> 16:28.758
I'm rather partial to the stuffed chihuahua

16:28.808 --> 16:30.901
with the Hope Zion t-shirt.

16:31.945 --> 16:34.704
Here we go.

16:38.447 --> 16:40.302
- Good to go.
- Yeah.

16:43.468 --> 16:44.431
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:44.481 --> 16:45.616
There he is.

16:45.709 --> 16:48.251
We got, uh, Mrs. Bardsley
in bed 1 all stitched up.

16:48.301 --> 16:50.071
She's just waiting
for her husband to pick her up.

16:50.221 --> 16:52.989
Mr. Farrah, bed 2,
just needs a T.B. booster,

16:52.991 --> 16:54.319
and then he's good to go.

16:54.392 --> 16:56.787
And I just talked
to the surgical step-down ward.

16:56.865 --> 16:58.112
Our doored cyclist is in the clear.

16:58.162 --> 17:00.125
Doug Renfroe, our MVC...

17:00.265 --> 17:02.231
he has a mild concussion
and two cracked ribs.

17:02.303 --> 17:04.885
And what is your suggested course of action?

17:05.002 --> 17:06.826
Tape him up, send him home.

17:06.876 --> 17:09.522
Right. And what happens when Mr.
Renfroe gets home and

17:09.573 --> 17:11.339
feels drowsy, falls asleep,
and never wakes up again?

17:11.342 --> 17:12.393
I already talked to his roommate,

17:12.443 --> 17:13.521
advised him
of the concussion protocol.

17:13.570 --> 17:14.944
What is our motto today?

17:14.993 --> 17:15.953
I went through the checklist with him.

17:16.002 --> 17:17.443
- I was very...
- Say it.

17:17.982 --> 17:18.960
No one else dies today.

17:19.031 --> 17:20.486
That's right,
and in order to achieve that,

17:20.536 --> 17:23.435
we need to give 110%, right?

17:23.587 --> 17:24.553
That's right.

17:24.555 --> 17:26.028
So, I need you to go see Doug,

17:26.131 --> 17:28.015
give him some ibuprofen for his headache,

17:28.108 --> 17:30.354
and continue to keep an eye on him.

17:31.028 --> 17:32.594
Thanks, man.

17:40.863 --> 17:42.110
Okay, Janice.

17:42.271 --> 17:44.405
Oh, can you take those off for me, please?

17:48.532 --> 17:50.912
And roll up your sleeve.

17:52.024 --> 17:54.014
Great. Thank you.

17:55.998 --> 17:57.561
Get a good look.

17:57.611 --> 18:00.107
I'm assuming
the other arm is the same?

18:00.457 --> 18:03.444
There is some damage you can't undo.

18:03.522 --> 18:06.445
Okay, well, make a fist.

18:06.544 --> 18:07.889
Great.

18:09.835 --> 18:12.799
I'm having some trouble
finding a usable vein.

18:13.415 --> 18:15.438
Yeah, well, can't you just
stick me somewhere else?

18:15.488 --> 18:17.957
Well, normally in these circumstances,

18:18.007 --> 18:19.506
I would use a central line,

18:19.508 --> 18:20.835
and I'd draw the blood from there,

18:20.885 --> 18:23.003
but that's not a good idea for you.

18:23.053 --> 18:23.961
For me.

18:25.223 --> 18:27.547
How long did you say you've been clean?

18:28.173 --> 18:31.702
Janice, I need to know.
When was the last time you used?

18:31.810 --> 18:34.216
Yeah.

18:34.266 --> 18:35.686
I don't know.

18:35.795 --> 18:40.027
Well, if I put in a central line
and you used it to do drugs,

18:40.077 --> 18:42.195
you would most likely overdose.

18:49.393 --> 18:51.240
I want to see her.

18:51.447 --> 18:54.795
Right now. I want to see Taylor.

18:54.924 --> 18:55.970
I'm sorry.

18:56.076 --> 18:57.651
Nancy's not comfortable with that.

18:57.812 --> 18:59.809
Well, she better get
comfortable with it, okay?

18:59.859 --> 19:03.038
'Cause I'm not doing
anything until I see my kid.

19:09.366 --> 19:12.890
Every vessel attached. Open clamp.

19:13.656 --> 19:15.617
Prepare to take him off pump.

19:15.763 --> 19:16.755
Preparing to take him off.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.535
Give me an amp of epi.

19:34.814 --> 19:36.589
It's fibrillating.

19:40.066 --> 19:42.053
Shouldn't it be contracting by now?

19:42.055 --> 19:43.354
Give it a minute.

19:55.941 --> 19:57.266
Dr. Bell, should we shock?

19:57.316 --> 19:58.973
Yes. Paddles.

19:59.853 --> 20:01.237
Charge to 10.

20:03.194 --> 20:04.106
Discharge.

20:06.704 --> 20:08.344
Not kicking in.

20:08.831 --> 20:10.580
Once more. Charge to 20.

20:12.050 --> 20:13.049
Discharge.

20:17.053 --> 20:19.562
Come on, George.

20:19.909 --> 20:22.952
Third time's a charm. Charge to 30.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.068
Discharge.

20:31.386 --> 20:33.471
Asystole.

20:33.859 --> 20:35.525
We got a stone heart.

20:35.575 --> 20:37.931
It's not salvageable? How does that happen?

20:37.981 --> 20:40.824
I don't know. Maybe it was
on ice too long in transit.

20:41.776 --> 20:43.996
Keep his pH and electrolytes stable,

20:44.046 --> 20:45.926
and we got to look for a new heart.

20:46.107 --> 20:50.065
A new heart?
How do... how do we do that?

20:51.090 --> 20:53.054
Page Charlie.

20:53.501 --> 20:55.323
Okay.

21:05.283 --> 21:07.141
Hey. You had a suicide this morning.

21:07.191 --> 21:08.460
She came into the E.R.

21:08.510 --> 21:10.013
Yeah. She's in the ICU, brain-dead.

21:10.063 --> 21:11.446
Are you sure?

21:11.576 --> 21:13.728
Yeah. She had a full work-up,
was legally declared.

21:13.778 --> 21:15.120
Were her organs damaged?

21:15.170 --> 21:16.408
No.

21:16.972 --> 21:18.457
The transplant that I'm doing...

21:18.507 --> 21:20.553
the donor heart is unusable.

21:20.603 --> 21:21.226
Okay.

21:21.276 --> 21:22.240
What's her blood type?

21:22.290 --> 21:23.627
"O."

21:23.808 --> 21:25.738
That's amazing. That is amazing.

21:25.788 --> 21:28.040
No, no, Dawn, Dawn, she's not a candidate.

21:28.661 --> 21:29.656
Her father's in the ICU,

21:29.658 --> 21:32.071
and he's insisting that she
stay on life support, so...

21:33.104 --> 21:34.752
Yeah. Sorry.

21:38.622 --> 21:41.173
I don't care what my father wants.

21:41.929 --> 21:44.273
I want to help that man in there.

21:45.214 --> 21:48.221
Some good should come out of all of this.

21:52.691 --> 21:54.270
Oh, Dawn?

21:54.347 --> 21:55.051
Yeah?

21:55.101 --> 21:56.557
How long you got?

21:58.776 --> 22:01.141
Well, I can keep him on
pump for a couple of hours,

22:01.191 --> 22:03.252
but after that, even with a new heart,

22:03.335 --> 22:05.964
his chances of waking up are slim to none.

22:06.057 --> 22:07.594
You got to do something.

22:07.682 --> 22:09.560
Convince my father to let me die.

22:12.944 --> 22:14.812
Let me see what I can do.

22:17.787 --> 22:19.924
Thanks, Charlie.

22:23.515 --> 22:26.415
Get inside the O.R. with the
cast and crew of saving hope

22:26.465 --> 22:28.860
at ctv.ca/savinghope

22:29.533 --> 22:32.591
God, look at her. She's so grown up.

22:32.653 --> 22:36.394
I hear she races dirt bikes,
that she's really good at it.

22:38.149 --> 22:39.739
Of course she's good.

22:41.542 --> 22:43.576
We better go.

22:47.535 --> 22:49.625
Can I just hug her first?

22:49.675 --> 22:51.312
I don't think that's a good idea.

22:51.897 --> 22:53.299
Please.

22:53.349 --> 22:55.617
Janice, you can't go in there.

22:56.285 --> 22:58.660
Hey. What the hell is going on?

22:59.472 --> 23:01.335
- Did you let her in there?
- No.

23:01.402 --> 23:02.768
Would it be such a crime if she did?

23:02.820 --> 23:04.502
Yeah, actually, it would.

23:04.552 --> 23:06.411
What, you think I'm gonna sell her crack?

23:06.500 --> 23:07.782
I gave birth to her, Nancy, okay?

23:07.832 --> 23:08.942
Like I'm gonna hurt her.

23:09.019 --> 23:10.737
Well, you won't because I won't let you.

23:10.787 --> 23:14.944
Right. I'm a screw-up.
I lied about being clean.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.826
Oh so she's using again. Of course.

23:17.876 --> 23:19.057
Excuse me.

23:19.492 --> 23:20.878
Little help in here!

23:20.880 --> 23:22.147
Taylor, how are you feeling?

23:22.149 --> 23:23.415
Taylor! What's happening?

23:23.417 --> 23:24.416
- You need to back away.
- Why...

23:24.418 --> 23:25.375
why is she like this?

23:25.458 --> 23:26.384
Her temperature's up.

23:26.434 --> 23:27.430
Incision looks clean.

23:27.502 --> 23:28.801
Could be a clot in a portal vein.

23:28.884 --> 23:30.855
Let's get her on clot busters
and back up to the ICU.

23:30.905 --> 23:32.480
- Let's go. Move out of the way!
- Taylor?

23:32.530 --> 23:34.570
You need to move, please. Let's go!

23:34.620 --> 23:36.526
Honey? Okay, mama's here.

23:41.721 --> 23:42.756
I should go.

23:42.806 --> 23:43.714
You don't have to leave.

23:43.765 --> 23:45.980
No, it seems that me passing out

23:46.052 --> 23:47.827
is the least of your problems.

23:48.076 --> 23:50.094
People pass out in surgery all the time.

23:50.144 --> 23:51.449
I embarrassed you.

23:52.927 --> 23:55.170
Okay, I am truly coming to dread that sound.

23:55.220 --> 23:56.551
Dawn here.

23:57.478 --> 23:59.697
Yeah. We're still waiting.

23:59.919 --> 24:02.088
Dr. Harris is on it.

24:05.389 --> 24:07.291
Good luck with the heart, Dawn.

24:07.293 --> 24:08.349
I really mean that.

24:08.399 --> 24:10.113
Okay, you know what?

24:10.486 --> 24:12.225
I feel like there's something
that I'm supposed to say to you,

24:12.287 --> 24:14.434
but I don't know what that is.

24:14.633 --> 24:16.685
There's nothing to say.

24:18.279 --> 24:20.426
I'm sorry I didn't protect you.

24:20.483 --> 24:23.313
What's that supposed to mean?

24:23.509 --> 24:24.808
I went against my gut.

24:24.810 --> 24:27.334
I knew it was a bad idea
bringing you in there.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.352
Well, why did you do it?

24:29.761 --> 24:33.036
Because I didn't want to disappoint you.

24:33.151 --> 24:35.085
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

24:35.220 --> 24:37.854
I got a guy in there
with an open chest cavity

24:37.856 --> 24:39.322
and no heart to put in it.

24:39.324 --> 24:41.020
I don't... I don't need this.

24:41.070 --> 24:42.091
Okay.

24:43.105 --> 24:45.161
I don't need this, either, then.

24:46.924 --> 24:48.694
Lane?

25:00.710 --> 25:02.768
Hey! Doug!

25:02.914 --> 25:03.803
What?

25:03.901 --> 25:06.204
Just making sure you're rousable here.

25:06.316 --> 25:08.227
Dude, if you're trying to arouse me,

25:08.277 --> 25:09.738
there are better ways.

25:09.788 --> 25:10.953
Keep testing him.

25:10.955 --> 25:11.987
All right.

25:12.362 --> 25:14.009
Okay, I want you to give me three animals

25:14.059 --> 25:15.487
starting with the letter "s."

25:15.560 --> 25:16.525
What?

25:17.220 --> 25:19.026
Hey, man,
I'd love to go home now.

25:19.129 --> 25:21.596
Look, I know, but Dr.
Miller... he's being a bit...

25:21.934 --> 25:24.066
I just can't discharge you
until I know you can pass

25:24.068 --> 25:25.467
the concussion protocol test.

25:25.469 --> 25:26.401
Fine.

25:26.403 --> 25:27.769
Uh, animals that start with "s."

25:28.558 --> 25:32.340
Uh, sheep, snake, and, uh...

25:33.711 --> 25:34.576
I don't know.

25:34.578 --> 25:35.410
Sushi?

25:35.412 --> 25:36.244
It's a fish.

25:36.246 --> 25:37.946
Okay. I might accept that.

25:37.948 --> 25:40.414
Okay. Give me the capital of Saskatchewan.

25:40.416 --> 25:41.783
Saskatoon.

25:41.785 --> 25:42.917
Actually, it's Regina.

25:42.919 --> 25:44.586
See? Not doing so good there, Doug.

25:44.588 --> 25:46.197
That doesn't prove that I have a concussion.

25:46.247 --> 25:47.615
It just proves I'm dumb.

25:47.724 --> 25:48.723
Okay, last one...

25:48.725 --> 25:50.091
I want you to give me three numbers,

25:50.093 --> 25:51.626
then repeat them to me in reverse.

25:51.961 --> 25:54.192
13, 42, 99.

25:54.471 --> 25:56.748
99, 42, 13.

25:56.900 --> 25:58.265
Okay. Very good.

25:58.267 --> 26:00.902
They're my nana's lotto numbers.
She plays them every week.

26:00.904 --> 26:02.227
Oh, yeah? She ever win?

26:02.445 --> 26:05.461
Once. 500 bucks.
She gave it to the church.

26:05.511 --> 26:06.791
She sounds like an awesome lady.

26:06.841 --> 26:07.862
No. She's a bitch.

26:07.912 --> 26:10.093
But I should still visit
her when I get out of here.

26:10.178 --> 26:12.557
Okay. I'll be back
to check on you in a bit.

26:12.607 --> 26:15.248
Brush up on your geography,
and I'd say you're good to go.

26:17.306 --> 26:18.785
So far, so good.

26:18.787 --> 26:20.819
All right. Good. Well, let's keep it up.

26:20.933 --> 26:23.389
Push to the finish. Eye on the prize, right?

26:24.591 --> 26:26.066
Coaching my kid's soccer team.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.898
Oh, yeah? How are they doing?

26:27.948 --> 26:28.958
Last place.

26:29.030 --> 26:30.896
It's them. It's not me.

26:37.683 --> 26:40.037
About time someone came to look in on her.

26:40.120 --> 26:43.664
Uh, Mr. Stewart,
I didn't introduce myself before.

26:43.714 --> 26:45.910
I'm Dr. Harris.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.744
I was part of the E.R.
Trauma team that, uh...

26:50.324 --> 26:51.747
saw Bryn.

26:51.885 --> 26:54.052
Um, I understand that you're asking

26:54.102 --> 26:55.854
to keep her on life support.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.158
If you're here to convince me otherwise...

26:58.292 --> 26:59.489
No, no, no. I'm-I'm...

26:59.539 --> 27:00.948
I'm not here to convince you of anything.

27:00.998 --> 27:02.711
That's-that's not my job.

27:02.896 --> 27:04.615
Then why are you here?

27:05.485 --> 27:07.966
I'm here to let you know
what your options are

27:08.315 --> 27:12.032
so that, uh, you have all
the information you need

27:12.082 --> 27:14.004
to make the best decision for Bryn.

27:14.229 --> 27:16.240
I know what's right for Bryn.

27:16.925 --> 27:18.907
Okay. Um...

27:19.647 --> 27:22.513
Bryn has sustained
a massive cranial trauma.

27:23.052 --> 27:25.748
She has zero brain activity.

27:27.031 --> 27:29.008
Now, has anyone had the opportunity today

27:29.058 --> 27:31.403
to speak to you about organ donation?

27:32.003 --> 27:33.820
I'd like you to leave.

27:33.949 --> 27:35.103
Now.

27:35.626 --> 27:37.266
Mr. Stewart, I'm just...

27:37.323 --> 27:38.627
Get out!

27:40.831 --> 27:42.425
Okay.

27:49.276 --> 27:51.087
Where are you going?

27:51.268 --> 27:53.446
To tell Dr. Bell that she needs a plan "B"

27:53.496 --> 27:55.676
or plan "C"
or whatever she wants to call

27:55.726 --> 27:57.643
a new plan at this particular point.

27:57.798 --> 28:00.364
So, that's it? You're just giving up?

28:00.785 --> 28:03.847
Look, we don't have much
of a choice here, okay?

28:04.007 --> 28:06.320
I can't exactly tell your
father that his daughter's ghost

28:06.403 --> 28:08.095
wants a transplant to happen, so...

28:08.250 --> 28:10.072
Then he wins. Again.

28:10.491 --> 28:12.286
He wins again?

28:13.269 --> 28:15.598
He made my life a living hell.

28:16.007 --> 28:18.573
Now he's bent on keeping me here.

28:21.057 --> 28:23.209
My father...

28:24.669 --> 28:27.799
Started touching me when I was 8,

28:28.529 --> 28:33.015
told me if I ever told my mother,
it would kill her.

28:33.827 --> 28:35.892
So I didn't.

28:35.959 --> 28:37.920
I protected her.

28:38.055 --> 28:41.905
I kept it all to myself until I...

28:42.593 --> 28:46.995
I put that gun to my head because of him,

28:46.997 --> 28:50.365
because of what he did to me.

28:50.367 --> 28:51.566
Please.

28:51.568 --> 28:55.637
You are the only one who can help me now.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.553
It's gonna be really embarrassing

29:09.603 --> 29:11.778
if I have to call security on you.

29:12.677 --> 29:14.747
I came to apologize.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.650
What are you doing?

29:20.621 --> 29:23.476
You see,
I just became a father, too.

29:23.854 --> 29:27.621
And, uh, I have no idea

29:27.843 --> 29:30.679
what it is you must be
going through right now,

29:31.031 --> 29:32.505
what, uh...

29:33.178 --> 29:35.300
what it must be like to
see your child like this.

29:37.328 --> 29:39.082
No, you don't.

29:39.584 --> 29:41.459
And the fact
that she did this to herself...

29:41.509 --> 29:43.092
I mean, I...

29:43.837 --> 29:46.202
I can't even imagine the
guilt you must feel...

29:47.014 --> 29:49.612
That there were signs you should have seen

29:50.683 --> 29:53.648
of how much she was hurting inside.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.054
But you can't blame yourself.

30:00.545 --> 30:02.113
I do.

30:07.132 --> 30:10.334
You know, as fathers, we try to protect

30:10.336 --> 30:13.901
our-our children
from every-every cruelty.

30:15.665 --> 30:18.309
But you can't be there
every second of every day.

30:18.359 --> 30:22.881
You can't live
their whole lives for them.

30:28.089 --> 30:31.944
I tried to be a good father.

30:32.746 --> 30:34.396
I did.

30:34.821 --> 30:36.508
I know you did.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.731
But you can rest now.

30:41.118 --> 30:42.613
Your job is done.

30:43.333 --> 30:45.552
Your daughter's at peace.

31:03.146 --> 31:06.902
And if it will give you some peace

31:07.880 --> 31:10.669
knowing that your daughter
helped save a life...

31:11.973 --> 31:14.063
Then we can do that.

31:14.757 --> 31:16.666
And if not, that's okay, too.

31:32.453 --> 31:35.084
He's not gonna sign it, is he?

32:11.199 --> 32:13.087
That is one gorgeous heart.

32:14.323 --> 32:15.523
You know, Dawn, I'd...

32:15.525 --> 32:16.957
I'd stick around
to watch you do your thing,

32:16.959 --> 32:18.359
but I heard that can be dangerous,

32:18.361 --> 32:19.694
so I'm just gonna wait outside.

32:21.030 --> 32:22.497
Hardy har har.

32:23.877 --> 32:26.041
Take care of that heart.

32:26.091 --> 32:27.768
I'll do my best.

32:38.446 --> 32:40.780
Aorta and the pulmonary vein are tightened.

32:42.934 --> 32:45.102
We're ready. It's ready to go.

32:46.320 --> 32:47.721
Is it tight enough?

32:47.798 --> 32:49.832
- Tighter than a nun's...
- Okay, don't finish that.

32:49.858 --> 32:52.258
I'm making an executive decision here, Doug.

32:52.346 --> 32:55.223
Our time together
has officially come to an end.

32:55.394 --> 32:56.829
No more skill-testing questions?

32:56.831 --> 32:58.287
Nope. I'm afraid not.

32:59.901 --> 33:03.132
Hey, uh, can I get
some pain meds for the road?

33:03.182 --> 33:05.108
I could give you some more ibuprofen.

33:05.158 --> 33:08.849
Well, how about something
with a little more kick?

33:08.899 --> 33:10.664
Nothing that would be
impeding your cognition.

33:10.714 --> 33:13.278
Ah. Captain buzzkill.

33:13.515 --> 33:15.338
Hey, that's me.

33:15.388 --> 33:16.683
See you around, Saskatoon.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.257
We managed to break up the clot
that was stopping blood flow.

33:32.381 --> 33:34.518
She's getting stronger,
but she's not out of the woods yet.

33:34.673 --> 33:36.634
There you go. The kid's gonna be okay.

33:36.950 --> 33:38.411
She almost died, Janice.

33:38.461 --> 33:40.494
I know. I was there.

33:40.815 --> 33:42.300
I have good news.

33:42.502 --> 33:44.836
I have your test results. You are a match.

33:44.939 --> 33:46.186
Oh, my...

33:46.750 --> 33:48.265
oh, my god! Thank god!

33:48.939 --> 33:52.902
Oh, but what about the drugs?

33:59.805 --> 34:01.689
I'll get clean.

34:03.355 --> 34:05.171
I can get you into detox.

34:05.306 --> 34:07.924
Once you're clean, you can start donating.

34:10.397 --> 34:13.905
You're gonna do this, right?

34:14.625 --> 34:16.739
You have to.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.293
I'll do it.

34:23.452 --> 34:25.014
But I want to meet her.

34:25.781 --> 34:28.958
For real this time.

34:33.246 --> 34:34.257
Okay.

34:37.320 --> 34:40.786
If I let you meet her,

34:41.966 --> 34:46.101
do you promise not to tell
her who you really are?

34:46.753 --> 34:50.483
What would you do if it was your kid?

34:50.654 --> 34:51.944
Taylor's very sick.

34:51.994 --> 34:53.297
She's very weak, and news like this

34:53.348 --> 34:55.507
could be deeply upsetting to her.

34:55.989 --> 34:57.847
She needs to be strong right now.

34:58.090 --> 34:59.833
Her health is the priority.

35:07.952 --> 35:10.177
Is it gonna work?

35:12.325 --> 35:14.529
Vent on. Leave some blood behind.

35:15.082 --> 35:17.085
What's happening?

35:23.007 --> 35:23.805
- Yes.
- Yes.

35:23.807 --> 35:25.007
Whoo!

35:25.009 --> 35:27.576
My heart, it took.

35:27.578 --> 35:29.345
It did.

35:31.514 --> 35:33.714
Thank you.

35:33.716 --> 35:36.050
It doesn't hurt anymore.

35:53.787 --> 35:55.926
Taylor, we have fantastic news.

35:55.976 --> 35:59.873
Hey, honey. It's gonna be okay.

36:00.281 --> 36:02.242
We found a match.

36:03.908 --> 36:06.138
This is Janice.

36:06.558 --> 36:09.072
And she's gonna save your life.

36:09.418 --> 36:11.018
Really?

36:11.272 --> 36:12.870
Yeah.

36:14.992 --> 36:16.653
Have we met?

36:17.150 --> 36:20.126
We have. Yeah.

36:22.448 --> 36:23.963
You wouldn't remember.

36:23.965 --> 36:25.497
It was a...

36:26.893 --> 36:29.144
it was a long time ago.

36:31.364 --> 36:34.810
I'm, um...

36:38.677 --> 36:40.455
Are you okay?

36:41.692 --> 36:44.652
I'm just an old friend of your mom's.

36:47.891 --> 36:49.186
Right on.

36:49.236 --> 36:50.822
Yeah.

36:55.251 --> 36:57.122
Mr. Herdman is going to take it easy

36:57.172 --> 36:58.555
on the yard work for a while.

36:58.605 --> 36:59.280
Good.

36:59.332 --> 37:01.630
And I wrote the businessman
a scrip for methocarbamol

37:01.632 --> 37:03.766
and made him promise to
follow up with his G.P.

37:03.849 --> 37:07.605
We stuck to our plan,
we were diligent, and...

37:07.719 --> 37:09.308
- No one else died today.
- No one else died today.

37:09.358 --> 37:09.858
I feel like we should hug.

37:09.908 --> 37:11.434
Do you guys want to have
a big hug right now?

37:11.484 --> 37:13.509
Let's just do that.

37:14.001 --> 37:15.143
What the hell is this?

37:15.145 --> 37:16.479
Male, early 20s.

37:16.573 --> 37:18.546
Found him collapsed at a bus stop close by,

37:18.548 --> 37:19.680
vital signs absent.

37:19.682 --> 37:21.478
Flatline throughout?

37:27.689 --> 37:29.431
Hold on the CPR.

37:37.343 --> 37:39.149
20 minutes?

37:46.336 --> 37:48.416
Time of death, 9:04 P.M.

37:54.636 --> 37:56.382
I sent him home.

37:56.441 --> 37:59.277
His C.T. was clear.
You did everything right.

37:59.355 --> 38:01.968
But I sent him home.

38:02.972 --> 38:05.010
Hey, this is all on me.

38:07.060 --> 38:09.061
I set a game plan this morning

38:09.063 --> 38:11.665
that was impossible to see through.

38:12.063 --> 38:14.554
We do our best,
we give it everything we got,

38:14.604 --> 38:16.028
and even still some people die.

38:16.078 --> 38:18.867
That's just the way this works,
and it sucks.

38:21.072 --> 38:22.341
But the people we see tomorrow

38:22.391 --> 38:24.414
have nothing to do
with the ones we lost today.

38:27.053 --> 38:30.375
No short-term memory,
Dr. Sekara, you hear me?

38:33.371 --> 38:35.454
Get over it.

38:43.662 --> 38:44.962
Dev...

39:01.412 --> 39:03.305
You came back.

39:03.448 --> 39:04.614
I did.

39:04.616 --> 39:06.648
I'm sorry for earlier.

39:06.720 --> 39:10.751
I was feeling really...
really sorry for myself.

39:10.955 --> 39:12.992
Apology accepted.

39:13.258 --> 39:14.394
Oh.

39:15.600 --> 39:18.347
So, muskoka is definitely out.

39:18.642 --> 39:21.359
But there are a number of other ways

39:21.409 --> 39:25.168
that we can... entertain ourselves.

39:27.370 --> 39:31.583
Lane, that heart transplant was incredible.

39:31.633 --> 39:33.475
It was just...

39:35.449 --> 39:37.513
I mean, when the first heart didn't take,

39:37.515 --> 39:38.714
I thought that was it

39:38.716 --> 39:40.980
because that's usually how it goes, right?

39:41.030 --> 39:42.419
And then it just...

39:42.469 --> 39:43.847
stop talking.

39:44.136 --> 39:45.694
Okay, I know. I'm sorry. I'm just...

39:45.744 --> 39:46.884
Shut up.

39:47.138 --> 39:48.550
What?

39:48.778 --> 39:49.725
Mm.

39:49.893 --> 39:51.226
Take off your skirt.

39:51.365 --> 39:52.928
Okay. Slow down. I'm...

39:52.930 --> 39:54.696
Take off your skirt.

39:54.698 --> 39:55.563
Hey, slow down.

39:59.835 --> 40:01.135
Get your hands...

40:01.137 --> 40:02.269
Shh. Shh. Shh.

40:02.271 --> 40:04.905
I got you. I got you.

40:04.907 --> 40:06.841
Shh!

40:27.730 --> 40:30.397
I know what you did to her.

40:31.799 --> 40:34.033
What are you talking about?

40:38.840 --> 40:41.407
You can't hurt her anymore.
