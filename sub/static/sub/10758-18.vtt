WEBVTT

00:09.101 --> 00:11.603
Hey, boys, how was dinner?

00:11.812 --> 00:13.855
Let's say when I picked my lobster
out of the tank,

00:14.022 --> 00:17.567
I had no idea he was in
for a better evening than I was.

00:18.193 --> 00:20.403
- What happened?
- Well, it started out well enough.

00:20.612 --> 00:23.532
First, they seated us
at a superb table,

00:23.698 --> 00:25.659
certainly better
than the one next to us,

00:25.825 --> 00:27.160
at which, unfortunately, they sat

00:27.327 --> 00:29.663
- Daphne and Donny.
- Oh, jeez.

00:29.829 --> 00:32.582
Being very affectionate,
of course, whispering,

00:32.749 --> 00:34.000
laughing, holding hands.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.836
This in a place
where people were trying to eat.

00:37.962 --> 00:39.923
Well, in an attempt
to make things better,

00:40.090 --> 00:42.467
I suggested that Niles
and I switch seats

00:42.634 --> 00:44.928
so that he could face the other table.

00:45.136 --> 00:46.846
Unfortunately, moments later,

00:47.013 --> 00:49.766
they seated Maris there
with her new boyfriend.

00:52.018 --> 00:53.686
Also being affectionate.

00:53.895 --> 00:56.773
Grooming each other
like spider monkeys.

00:57.982 --> 00:59.609
She was deliberately taunting me,

00:59.776 --> 01:02.445
playing the same coquettish games
we used to play in restaurants:

01:02.654 --> 01:06.449
Batting her eyes, then coyly hiding
behind her breadstick.

01:08.993 --> 01:10.244
And then to top it all off,

01:10.411 --> 01:12.830
the Pouilly Fuissé we ordered
was a grave disappointment.

01:13.039 --> 01:16.125
I urged he send it back, but he wouldn't
create a scene in front of Daphne.

01:16.292 --> 01:17.710
Not that she would've even noticed,

01:18.002 --> 01:20.254
the way Donny was feeding her
forkfuls of risotto

01:20.421 --> 01:22.256
as if she'd lost her arms
instead of her mind.

01:22.423 --> 01:24.675
What is she doing with him?

01:24.884 --> 01:27.345
Well, some days,
it doesn't pay to get out of bed.

01:27.512 --> 01:29.347
The highlight of my day
is getting out of bed

01:29.514 --> 01:32.850
so I can slam it
back up into the wall.

01:33.059 --> 01:34.435
How long are you gonna stay there?

01:34.602 --> 01:36.437
You can afford
the Montana now, can't you?

01:36.646 --> 01:38.981
Yes, but thanks to Frasier,
there's a tenant living there.

01:39.190 --> 01:41.943
May I remind you that you begged me
to find you a sublet.

01:42.818 --> 01:44.612
Someone austere
and dignified enough

01:44.779 --> 01:46.781
not to offend
your starchy neighbours.

01:46.948 --> 01:48.574
Frasier, I'm not trying to blame you.

01:48.741 --> 01:50.826
It's just my whole world
is crashing down around me.

01:50.993 --> 01:52.745
- I wanna go home.
- Well, I'm sorry, Niles.

01:52.912 --> 01:54.455
He's got two months left
on his sublet.

01:54.663 --> 01:56.582
Can't you give him a call
and lean on him a bit?

01:56.749 --> 02:00.336
Dad, the man has a lease. I can't
very well call and ask him to move out.

02:01.796 --> 02:03.089
- Hi, Daph.
- Evening, all.

02:03.255 --> 02:05.216
- How's dinner?
- It was wonderful.

02:05.382 --> 02:06.884
You should've come over
and joined us.

02:07.051 --> 02:09.220
Well, you looked like
you had enough to contend with,

02:09.386 --> 02:12.848
what with your table's fork shortage.

02:15.517 --> 02:17.311
Donny takes such good care of me.

02:17.478 --> 02:19.313
After you left,
I made the tiniest comment

02:19.480 --> 02:22.650
about not liking the Pouilly Fuissé,
and he sent it back.

02:22.858 --> 02:25.110
That snooty wine steward
argued with him,

02:25.319 --> 02:26.820
but Donny made a scene
with the owner,

02:26.987 --> 02:30.115
and the next thing you knew,
our entire meal was on the house.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.951
I've never been prouder of him.

02:34.745 --> 02:36.997
Frasier, I wanna go home.

02:37.581 --> 02:39.958
I'll call Dr. MacLowery.

02:45.923 --> 02:49.259
- Why, Dr. Crane, you're back.
- Yes, Mrs. Latimer.

02:49.426 --> 02:51.845
Fortunately, my sublet
was able to move out early.

02:52.054 --> 02:53.972
I trust your tour was a success?

02:54.181 --> 02:57.434
- A triumph.
- Good. Take care.

02:57.935 --> 02:59.978
Tour?

03:00.729 --> 03:04.316
I could hardly let these people know
where I was living.

03:04.483 --> 03:06.318
I told them
I was on a lecture tour of Africa

03:06.485 --> 03:08.403
so they wouldn't try to contact me.

03:09.363 --> 03:12.032
Niles, maybe he isn't here.
Maybe we should just let ourselves in.

03:12.199 --> 03:14.242
Right. All right.

03:18.955 --> 03:20.665
I'm home.

03:24.127 --> 03:27.088
I can already feel the last four months
dropping away.

03:27.255 --> 03:31.092
Yes. Soon,
Africa will be just a memory.

03:34.095 --> 03:38.808
I just wanna close my eyes
and savour the serenity.

03:39.684 --> 03:41.811
What the hell is that?

03:43.229 --> 03:44.689
It's Dr. MacLowery.

03:47.108 --> 03:50.153
Doctor... Dr. MacLowery,
what are you doing?

03:50.320 --> 03:53.531
That was a ball change
leading to a riff drop.

03:53.740 --> 03:55.492
You gotta lick it and stick it.

03:55.700 --> 03:59.120
- When did you take up tap dancing?
- Years ago.

03:59.329 --> 04:02.123
I figured if I didn't dance,
I'd go crazy.

04:07.795 --> 04:09.923
I'm not sure he caught it in time.

04:14.927 --> 04:16.428
Baseboard. Baseboard.

04:16.596 --> 04:18.930
Dr. MacLowery, please,
the neighbours.

04:19.098 --> 04:21.476
You tell me about it.
Why, those bunch of sourpusses.

04:21.642 --> 04:23.353
Why, all they do is complain.

04:23.561 --> 04:25.772
Sunshine, rain.

04:30.943 --> 04:31.986
Well, look who it is.

04:32.153 --> 04:34.113
It's the Tenants' Board
come to welcome me home.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.782
Carol and Alfred Larkin,
you remember my brother, Frasier.

04:36.991 --> 04:38.618
Oh, and Mr. Probst.

04:38.784 --> 04:40.703
See here, Crane.

04:40.912 --> 04:43.664
We abhor noise in this building.

04:43.873 --> 04:46.167
I couldn't agree more.

04:49.003 --> 04:50.546
And what do you call that?

04:50.755 --> 04:54.634
I believe that was lick it and stick it.

04:57.094 --> 04:58.637
This has been going on for months.

04:58.804 --> 05:01.348
We would have contacted you
if we'd known how to.

05:01.557 --> 05:03.100
I'm sorry, but Dr. MacLowery's
moving...

05:03.267 --> 05:05.853
Dr. Crane, I'm afraid
the board is leaning

05:06.020 --> 05:08.522
towards rescinding your lease.

05:08.731 --> 05:10.816
What? Why?

05:11.025 --> 05:13.068
Because you're a menace, Crane.

05:14.737 --> 05:15.905
You always have been.

05:16.071 --> 05:19.116
You have something of a reputation
in this building.

05:19.283 --> 05:21.911
What with all the raucous parties
you've hosted.

05:22.119 --> 05:23.579
I'm not a well man.

05:23.787 --> 05:26.749
I have a serious heart problem
and I demand quiet.

05:26.916 --> 05:28.584
- We all do.
- Mr. Probst, I assure you...

05:28.751 --> 05:31.086
No, we're having a board meeting
tomorrow evening

05:31.253 --> 05:33.255
in which we intend to discuss
your situation.

05:33.422 --> 05:37.259
And if I were you,
I wouldn't plan on unpacking.

05:39.511 --> 05:42.306
So nice seeing you again.

05:48.270 --> 05:50.939
It was good of you to go to all this
trouble for your brother.

05:51.106 --> 05:52.733
Yes. Well, in a way,
I felt responsible.

05:52.900 --> 05:54.318
Oh, really?
I don't know why.

05:54.526 --> 05:58.113
Just because you sublet my apartment
to Bojangles the Loon.

06:00.407 --> 06:02.075
I'll get it.

06:03.577 --> 06:04.786
Niles, will you relax, please?

06:04.953 --> 06:06.622
- Give me that.
- Oh, relax. How can I?

06:06.788 --> 06:09.082
In an hour, these people
could vote me out of my home.

06:09.291 --> 06:11.793
They won't if you show them
a good time at this reception.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.171
A couple of drinks, some food,
some witty conversation,

06:14.337 --> 06:16.131
they'll realise what an asset you are.

06:16.339 --> 06:18.050
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Roz.

06:18.258 --> 06:20.594
Great party, Niles.

06:23.138 --> 06:25.182
I was surprised to get
your last-minute invitation.

06:25.348 --> 06:27.893
You're not trying to set me up
with anybody, are you?

06:28.059 --> 06:29.728
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Good.

06:29.895 --> 06:31.563
You're here
because the caterer cancelled.

06:31.730 --> 06:32.772
Now, listen.

06:32.981 --> 06:34.900
We need you to open the wine,
cut up some limes

06:35.066 --> 06:36.985
and hang up this coat.

06:37.152 --> 06:39.321
You actually think I am
so hard up for a night out

06:39.487 --> 06:43.908
that I would spend the evening
pushing drinks in God's waiting room?

06:44.117 --> 06:46.578
- Keep your voice down.
- Roz, please.

06:46.745 --> 06:49.998
- You're paying for the babysitter.
- All right, done.

06:50.206 --> 06:52.083
- What am I, the dishwasher?
- No, Dad.

06:52.292 --> 06:55.378
You were invited because, well,
it just wouldn't be a party without you.

06:55.879 --> 06:58.548
Although there may be a few women
here that are unattached,

06:58.715 --> 07:03.136
who might just take a shine
to an old debonair dog like yourself.

07:03.344 --> 07:05.597
I'm just a piece of meat
to you guys, aren't I?

07:10.226 --> 07:12.270
There goes that damn
loose earring again.

07:12.478 --> 07:14.480
Thank goodness it didn't fall
into the punch bowl.

07:14.647 --> 07:16.232
Don't want someone
choking on it, do we?

07:16.399 --> 07:19.736
Yes, although nothing says party
like a tracheotomy.

07:20.361 --> 07:23.448
You must tell us all
about your African tour, Dr. Crane.

07:23.656 --> 07:27.744
Yes. Do the local people
actually enjoy your lectures?

07:27.952 --> 07:31.581
Well, yes, quite a bit.
Except, of course, for the pygmies.

07:31.748 --> 07:34.500
Most of it
went right over their heads.

07:38.963 --> 07:40.631
I'll get it.

07:44.886 --> 07:46.053
The rest of the board.

07:46.262 --> 07:47.972
Pleased to see you. Come in.

07:48.347 --> 07:51.017
- Hello, good to see you.
- Yes.

07:51.183 --> 07:52.643
Dr. Crane?

07:52.852 --> 07:54.270
While you were on the subcontinent,

07:54.437 --> 07:57.398
did you happen to spot
any rare African waterfowl?

07:57.607 --> 08:00.860
Just one, but it was already spotted.

08:06.574 --> 08:08.367
I'll get it.

08:09.452 --> 08:11.620
Shoo, shoo, shoo!
For God's sake, Niles,

08:11.787 --> 08:13.456
will you do something
with this damn bird?

08:13.622 --> 08:16.083
Quiet, quiet, quiet. Here.
There you go. Over here.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.461
Niles sucks.

08:22.464 --> 08:25.009
The boys at the Shangri-La
loved teaching her things like that.

08:25.175 --> 08:27.303
- It's so tiring.
- Bite me, Niles.

08:27.469 --> 08:28.721
Right back at you.

08:29.138 --> 08:31.724
Hurry with the hors d'oeuvres.
The guests are hostile toward me.

08:31.890 --> 08:33.726
I'm not gonna win any points
by starving them.

08:33.892 --> 08:37.604
- Stuff it, Niles.
- Oh, don't tempt me.

08:40.232 --> 08:41.650
- Dr. Crane?
- Yes.

08:41.817 --> 08:45.612
Who is that distinguished-Iooking man
over there?

08:48.824 --> 08:50.200
I've been trying to catch his eye,

08:50.367 --> 08:52.703
but he's far too engrossed
in that gardening book.

08:52.870 --> 08:56.248
Well, that is actually
my father, Martin. Dad?

08:59.084 --> 09:03.130
- Don't mind him. He's painfully shy.
- I know just how he feels.

09:03.297 --> 09:07.217
I'm a bit of a shrinking violet myself.
Martin.

09:08.844 --> 09:10.804
Do you see
that obnoxious old lecher?

09:11.013 --> 09:13.974
Well, you're gonna have
to be a lot more specific.

09:15.100 --> 09:17.853
The one in the blue jacket.
I'm about this close to slapping him.

09:18.020 --> 09:19.396
Wait, wait, that is Mr. Hawkins.

09:19.563 --> 09:21.398
He's the vice president
of the Tenants' Board.

09:21.565 --> 09:24.317
Well, I don't care who he is.
He just pinched me.

09:24.484 --> 09:26.903
Roz, please,
the man is 80 and arthritic.

09:27.070 --> 09:28.488
How hard can he pinch?

09:32.701 --> 09:34.244
People are not talking, not mixing.

09:34.411 --> 09:36.580
- People are pinching.
- Stop it. Stop it.

09:36.746 --> 09:39.165
The party is just starting.
Everything's gonna be just fine.

09:39.332 --> 09:41.293
Don't you touch me.

09:43.545 --> 09:45.505
Daphne, how are those other...?

09:48.258 --> 09:49.301
Baby?

09:52.846 --> 09:54.180
Oh, dear God.

09:58.268 --> 09:59.769
This bird's dead.

09:59.978 --> 10:01.104
How did this happen?

10:01.312 --> 10:03.773
She must have eaten
some of the hors d'oeuvres.

10:03.940 --> 10:06.192
You mean the ones
I just served to Niles' guests?

10:06.401 --> 10:08.027
You are very welcome.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.240
Frasier, I am so sorry.
I completely overreacted.

10:12.448 --> 10:14.784
People perked up once
they saw those appetisers of yours.

10:14.951 --> 10:16.995
You know,
I think the Niles Crane party curse

10:17.161 --> 10:19.914
has finally been laid to rest.

10:23.459 --> 10:24.836
What?

10:30.883 --> 10:33.011
Will somebody please tell me
what happened?

10:33.177 --> 10:35.513
I'm gonna let Daphne tell you.

10:39.142 --> 10:40.184
What is it?

10:40.351 --> 10:41.727
I don't mean to alarm you,

10:41.936 --> 10:44.105
but there's something wrong
with the hors d'oeuvre.

10:44.313 --> 10:47.441
- What? How do you know?
- A little bird told me.

10:51.779 --> 10:54.407
Sorry, sorry. I forgot the garnish.

10:54.574 --> 10:57.910
I'm dreadfully embarrassed about this.
Give me that. Thank you very much.

10:58.077 --> 11:00.955
This is the chef's prerogative.
You understand, of course.

11:01.122 --> 11:03.082
Roz, for God's sake.

11:07.420 --> 11:09.296
Did you see how it happened?
Anything?

11:09.505 --> 11:11.048
Well, I did hear her last words,

11:11.215 --> 11:14.135
but I don't think
they'd be of much comfort to you.

11:15.052 --> 11:17.012
Oh, God, Niles, I'm so sorry.

11:17.179 --> 11:22.101
The mayonnaise must have gone bad.
Or the crab or the pâté.

11:22.309 --> 11:23.561
Which one did she eat?

11:23.769 --> 11:26.021
I don't know.
Daphne, smell her beak.

11:27.189 --> 11:29.942
All right, all right, Niles,
are you all right?

11:30.150 --> 11:31.777
Yeah, I just need a moment.

11:31.944 --> 11:33.362
- Dr. Crane?
- That's long enough.

11:34.280 --> 11:37.366
Excuse me, I'm afraid
I spilled punch on my dress.

11:37.533 --> 11:39.076
- I need a towel.
- No. No.

11:39.243 --> 11:41.453
You're much better off using that...

11:41.620 --> 11:43.664
Yeah, this bread.

11:43.872 --> 11:45.666
- It's more absorbent.
- Really?

11:45.833 --> 11:48.794
Yes, that's why they call it
nature's sponge.

11:49.002 --> 11:51.422
All right.

11:52.631 --> 11:55.300
It's working.

11:58.220 --> 12:01.473
- All right, what do we do now?
- Daphne, you get rid of Baby.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.642
I'll get rid of this tainted food.

12:03.851 --> 12:05.602
But we still have
a roomful of hungry guests

12:05.769 --> 12:07.980
with nothing to serve them.

12:08.730 --> 12:10.607
Oh, God, would you look at that?

12:10.816 --> 12:12.859
She swallowed my earring.
That's what killed her.

12:13.068 --> 12:15.279
That means we don't have
to destroy the hors d'oeuvres.

12:15.445 --> 12:18.198
Frasier, Frasier, stop.
Are there any left?

12:18.824 --> 12:20.617
Yes, we're in luck.

12:21.410 --> 12:24.287
This intrepid little crab puff
has survived.

12:24.454 --> 12:27.874
Now, all I need is a very sharp knife
and 16 toothpicks.

12:29.626 --> 12:32.796
Niles, I am really getting tired
of these people.

12:32.963 --> 12:35.882
Some lady just handed me
a piece of wet bread.

12:36.091 --> 12:39.845
- Oh, this party is doomed.
- No, no, Niles, listen. Don't panic.

12:40.053 --> 12:42.138
We've got everything we need
to make hors d'oeuvres.

12:42.305 --> 12:45.392
All we need is time.
You get out there and stall. All right.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.602
Mrs. Latimer,
may I get you some punch?

12:47.769 --> 12:51.022
Well, your father went to get me some,
but that was quite a while ago.

12:51.189 --> 12:52.315
Please, allow me. Here.

12:52.482 --> 12:55.402
By the way, where is that
adorable bird of yours?

12:56.528 --> 12:58.405
She's resting.

12:59.072 --> 13:00.573
Travel really takes it out of her.

13:01.282 --> 13:03.618
You didn't take her to Africa, surely.

13:04.077 --> 13:05.328
Well, she has family there.

13:09.791 --> 13:11.084
Mr. Probst, having a good time?

13:11.251 --> 13:13.086
Look here, Crane,
if you're not gonna feed us,

13:13.253 --> 13:14.921
we might as well
take the vote right now.

13:15.088 --> 13:17.257
- No, please.
- I mean, you bring the hors d'oeuvres,

13:17.423 --> 13:20.093
you take the hors d'oeuvres away.
What kind of a game is this?

13:20.301 --> 13:21.636
Well, I'm not, I'm not...

13:21.803 --> 13:23.096
Oh, what a good idea.

13:23.304 --> 13:25.640
Why don't we all play a game?
Anyone have any suggestions?

13:25.807 --> 13:27.058
How about Murder?

13:27.267 --> 13:29.978
We played it at Irene Warriner's party.
It was a hoot.

13:30.186 --> 13:32.230
- Oh, how do we play?
- Well, here.

13:32.397 --> 13:35.024
Someone tear off
a few slips of paper

13:35.233 --> 13:37.193
and on one of them,
write the word "murderer."

13:37.402 --> 13:38.444
Then we'll pass them out

13:38.611 --> 13:41.364
and then everyone hide
and we'll turn out the lights.

13:41.531 --> 13:43.741
The murderer kills someone,
they lay down on the floor,

13:43.908 --> 13:46.911
and then we turn on the lights and
the detective tries to solve the crime.

13:47.078 --> 13:50.540
I'll tell you what. I'll volunteer
to play the detective for the first round.

13:50.706 --> 13:52.583
Let the mayhem begin.

13:52.792 --> 13:56.546
Oh, Martin, there you are.
Come, hide with me.

13:56.712 --> 13:59.674
I know a little nook
where no one will find us.

14:01.217 --> 14:03.761
Oh, this game's a lot scarier
than I thought.

14:05.554 --> 14:10.184
All right, turn out the lights.
Everyone, hide.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.940
- I can't see.
- Can I help you, sir?

14:16.107 --> 14:18.859
I don't have my glasses. Can you
tell me what it says on this thing?

14:19.026 --> 14:23.197
- It says "murderer."
- Good. Then you're dead.

14:23.989 --> 14:27.368
This party
just gets better and better.

14:28.786 --> 14:30.788
- How soon?
- I'm going as fast as I can.

14:30.996 --> 14:32.790
First batch should be ready
in five minutes.

14:32.998 --> 14:35.501
All right, five minutes it is.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.045
Ready or not, here I come.

14:38.212 --> 14:41.548
My goodness,
the foul fiend has struck already.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.550
Turn the lights on.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.720
Good heavens, he's struck twice.
That's not really in the rules, is it?

14:46.929 --> 14:49.181
- Frasier?
- Once dead, you can not speak.

14:49.348 --> 14:52.393
Take your cue from Mr. Probst.
All right, everyone.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.187
Did any of you see
anything suspicious?

14:55.354 --> 14:57.856
Any odd behaviour?

14:58.065 --> 15:01.527
Why don't you just guess who did it
so we can get this thing over with.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.237
Not yet.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.572
This is very intriguing.

15:05.739 --> 15:09.827
I think I'm going to have
to think about it for...

15:11.286 --> 15:13.163
...five minutes or so.

15:15.123 --> 15:18.252
- Maybe this game was a bad idea.
- No, the fun's just starting.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.337
I tell you what.
Let's turn out the lights again

15:20.504 --> 15:24.967
and we'll let our craven villain
ply his dark trade once more.

15:25.175 --> 15:28.679
Are you quite sure those two
didn't die of starvation?

15:28.887 --> 15:31.056
That's very funny.
Will you just turn out the lights?

15:31.890 --> 15:33.767
All right, everyone, hide.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.477
- I have a question.
- No. No talking.

15:35.644 --> 15:39.189
Just tell me,
can the murderer commit suicide?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.942
Well, no, Roz. That wouldn't make
much sense, would it?

15:42.150 --> 15:45.070
That's what I thought, but Mr. Probst
is the one who murdered me.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.072
- Oh, was he?
- Yes.

15:47.239 --> 15:51.868
Well, then, Mr. Probst, I don't think
someone is playing by the rules, is he?

15:52.035 --> 15:54.913
You see, this way, no one else
can get murdered, can they?

15:56.873 --> 15:58.375
Mr. Probst?

15:59.876 --> 16:01.753
What is it? What are you doing?

16:01.920 --> 16:04.673
- Nothing, Roz, nothing.
- Are you taking his pulse?

16:04.839 --> 16:08.176
I'm trying to. I just can't find one.

16:08.385 --> 16:11.638
Oh, my God. When he fell down,
I thought it was part of the game.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.223
It didn't even look real.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.849
It's time to wind the game up.

16:15.016 --> 16:16.935
The appetisers are ready
and they are delicious.

16:17.102 --> 16:20.063
I think this party
is finally back on track.

16:22.315 --> 16:26.694
Niles, I'm afraid Mr. Probst
has passed on.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.489
- What?
- Yes, you see,

16:29.656 --> 16:32.700
I think that heart condition of his
finally caught up with him.

16:33.159 --> 16:36.245
Dead? No, no, no, he's sleeping.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.209
Old people love to nap.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.045
Mr. Probst, time to wake up.
Mr. Probst...

16:44.212 --> 16:46.589
Niles, Niles, he's gone.

16:47.465 --> 16:50.885
Oh, my God, this is awful.
How could this happen?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.304
Shouldn't we notify someone?

16:53.513 --> 16:55.181
No, he was a widower.
He had no children.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.643
He lived alone in this building
for 25 years. Oh, this is so awful.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.561
Mr. Probst was right.
I am a menace.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.439
- No, Niles, this is not your fault.
- But it happened at my party.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.942
That's all they'll remember.
I may as well pack my bags.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.359
There's no need for that.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.945
We can still get him out of here
without anybody noticing.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.781
How?

17:12.823 --> 17:14.241
- You go find Dad.
- Why...?

17:14.407 --> 17:16.577
Tell him to call his friend
at the police department.

17:16.743 --> 17:19.121
One of his good friends, all right?
I'll handle the rest.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.873
- All right.
- What's the rest?

17:21.207 --> 17:23.876
I'm going to use the game
to distract everyone.

17:24.085 --> 17:26.587
I will take everyone into the kitchen
for questioning,

17:26.753 --> 17:28.881
thus drawing their attention
from the bodies.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.175
- What do you mean bodies?
- Roz...

17:31.342 --> 17:32.885
- No.
- You've got to get down.

17:33.093 --> 17:36.263
- No way in hell.
- All right, all right, how's this?

17:36.472 --> 17:39.642
I will pay your airfare
for that vacation of yours next month.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.645
No way. It's just too creepy.

17:42.811 --> 17:43.854
- First class?
- Business.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.106
- Done.
- All right, get down.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.818
Lie down.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.322
Frasier, Frasier,
I found Dad hiding from Mrs. Latimer.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.115
- He called his friend.
- Great.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.368
I'll start getting everyone
in the kitchen.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.787
Won't they wonder why
there hasn't been another murder?

17:59.953 --> 18:01.997
- Good point.
- Couldn't we move this along?

18:02.206 --> 18:04.500
- Roz, quiet.
- Here. The waggon's on its way.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.251
When it gets here,
let me deal with it.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.129
- Thank you. I really appreciate this.
- Dad, we need one more favour.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.672
You are now the killer. Come on.

18:10.839 --> 18:13.258
You've got to murder somebody,
preferably in the kitchen.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.510
- Oh, come on.
- Come on.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.721
You're not gonna make somebody lie
down on this dirty floor again, are you?

18:17.888 --> 18:20.807
There you are, Martin.
Have you been hiding from me?

18:21.016 --> 18:24.853
Hiding? No, you're just the person
I've been looking for.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.026
All right, turn on the lights.
Everyone... Roz, you okay?

18:31.234 --> 18:33.278
Yeah, it's a carnival down here.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.821
Everyone.

18:35.322 --> 18:39.701
There has been another murder
in the kitchen.

18:39.910 --> 18:45.290
I am ready to solve the crime
if you will all join me

18:45.665 --> 18:47.167
in the kitchen.

18:47.375 --> 18:49.002
Why can't you solve it right here?

18:49.169 --> 18:50.879
Well, I could.
But that wouldn't be proper.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.840
You see,
the hors d'oeuvres are in there.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.468
Come along, all right, everyone.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.386
We've got food.

18:58.595 --> 19:01.014
Don't touch the crime scene, please.
Thank you very much.

19:01.890 --> 19:04.434
On your way.
Thank you very much.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.686
Hurry, his fingers are getting stiff.

19:09.564 --> 19:10.649
All right, then.

19:10.857 --> 19:13.193
Before I determine
the identity of the killer,

19:13.360 --> 19:16.154
there are a few questions
I'd like to ask each of you.

19:17.697 --> 19:18.948
- I'll get it.
- No.

19:19.115 --> 19:21.159
No one leaves
until I've solved the crime.

19:21.367 --> 19:23.286
Except you, Dad.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.955
All right, then.

19:27.123 --> 19:29.417
I think I shall begin...

19:30.543 --> 19:34.088
...by drawing a diagram
of where each of you was standing

19:34.255 --> 19:37.258
when the first murder occurred.

19:39.719 --> 19:42.639
We have established that Miss Finn

19:42.847 --> 19:47.602
was talking with Mr. Larkin
in the upstairs hall

19:47.810 --> 19:50.813
at 8:14.

19:51.564 --> 19:54.233
And he muttered something.

19:56.652 --> 19:58.654
Why do you keep looking out there?

19:58.821 --> 20:01.991
I'll ask the questions
around here, Mrs. Larkin.

20:02.617 --> 20:05.286
We already told you,
your father killed Mrs. Latimer.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.872
- Mrs. Hawkins saw him.
- Mrs. Hawkins thought she saw him.

20:08.039 --> 20:10.541
No, Martin did kill me.

20:10.708 --> 20:13.961
And he's got a lot to learn
about playing gently.

20:17.089 --> 20:18.549
Mrs. Latimer,

20:19.175 --> 20:21.761
we have already broken
the no-eating-while-dead rule,

20:21.927 --> 20:24.889
but we will stand fast
on the quiet one.

20:25.723 --> 20:27.933
I'm bored, and I'm going home.

20:28.100 --> 20:32.563
No, no, no, wait,
you can't blame Niles for this because

20:32.897 --> 20:36.108
my father is the killer.

20:36.317 --> 20:39.361
Yes, the case is closed.
Shall we all play another round?

20:39.570 --> 20:42.114
God forbid. Where's Probst?

20:42.281 --> 20:44.325
He just left. He wasn't feeling well.

20:44.533 --> 20:46.702
- Yes, I hope he's all right, poor man.
- Who cares?

20:46.869 --> 20:49.038
I never liked the old coot anyway.

20:49.788 --> 20:50.831
You didn't?

20:51.040 --> 20:53.834
I was planning to vote for you tonight
just to annoy him.

20:54.043 --> 20:56.462
- Me too.
- Well, why don't we vote right now?

20:56.670 --> 20:59.798
Consider it done. You're in, Crane.
Welcome back.

21:00.007 --> 21:03.135
Carol, let's get out of here.

21:04.595 --> 21:07.306
Doesn't he have anything stiffer
than punch to drink?

21:07.514 --> 21:10.017
I don't like looking at dead bodies,
much less touching them.

21:10.184 --> 21:11.852
He's got a bottle of vodka
in the freezer.

21:12.019 --> 21:13.979
Oh, great.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.074

and I can assure you, from now on,

21:27.409 --> 21:29.745
this will be the quietest apartment
in the Montana.
