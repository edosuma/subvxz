03:08.489 --> 03:09.922
Hi Dad.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.259
Close your eyes.

03:18.132 --> 03:19.431
I'm off to the pond.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.465
OK.

03:20.467 --> 03:21.366
You OK?

03:21.368 --> 03:24.770
Uh huh,
slow pokey.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.972
My little baby.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.774
(laughs)

03:28.776 --> 03:29.975
I'll see
you in a minute.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.110
OK.

03:32.112 --> 03:33.145
Love you.

like family to her.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.307
Just a
wee kid.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.142
Well I might have
something leeching into my

04:37.144 --> 04:39.778

off my stock.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.948
Uh huh.

04:42.950 --> 04:47.686
It's already been a tough
year for the business.

04:47.688 --> 04:52.524
Water tests should
tell us everything.

beaver autopsy be?

05:18.319 --> 05:21.353
Good morning.

05:21.355 --> 05:24.523
Goats love
show tunes.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.957
I beg
your pardon?

05:25.959 --> 05:27.259
Nothing.

05:27.261 --> 05:30.662
Here,
eggs and your milk.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.098
Were you wanting
cheese today?

05:33.100 --> 05:34.433
I've got
fresh curds.

05:34.435 --> 05:35.934
Another time,
perhaps.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.536
Christian.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.004
My nephew, Christian.

05:39.006 --> 05:43.542
He's staying with me
for, well, we'll see.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.844
Your father
at the house?

05:49.650 --> 05:50.882
I'll just
go pay him.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.285
We have another
matter to discuss.

05:53.287 --> 05:56.655
You two talk.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.499
Wanna see a
dead raccoon?

06:26.186 --> 06:29.454
How'd it die?

06:29.456 --> 06:31.857
Well sir,
that's the mystery.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.925
Sir?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.794
You're weird.

06:52.212 --> 06:56.348
My aunt says
you're home schooled.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.049
So what's
wrong with you?

07:01.955 --> 07:03.955

07:03.957 --> 07:05.724
Hello?

07:05.726 --> 07:07.125
Jonathan?

07:10.798 --> 07:13.832
I have your payment
for this week's dairy.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.700
Thank you.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.772
Was there
anything else?

07:20.774 --> 07:23.008
I'm a touch
embarrassed to say,

07:23.010 --> 07:27.078
I had a bit of a spill
out there, on your walkway.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.081
I'm sorry.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.917
Where's it hurt?

07:34.354 --> 07:36.455
Yeah.

07:36.457 --> 07:39.357
That seems OK.

07:39.359 --> 07:42.127
Just OK?

07:53.040 --> 07:54.940
She's occupied.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.512
I'm sorry.

08:00.514 --> 08:05.517
I'll be sure to salt the
driveway more diligently.

08:05.519 --> 08:08.153
So why are
you here?

08:08.155 --> 08:11.256
Where'd you
come from?

08:11.258 --> 08:14.326
I traveled through time and
space and risked life and limb

08:14.328 --> 08:17.829
to be here
right now with you.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.032
The city.

08:21.034 --> 08:25.070
Pushed my mom to the brink, and
then I was sent to Auntie Liz's

08:25.072 --> 08:30.008
scared straight farm, or
whatnot, for delinquents.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.348
You know the girls at school,
they aren't like you.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.482
What are
they like?

08:37.484 --> 08:41.152
Manufactured,
plastic, digitized.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.220
You're weird.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.221

stop then.

09:10.584 --> 09:13.351

No, listen to me,

09:36.577 --> 09:38.376
First discovered on
the Everest expedition.

09:38.378 --> 09:41.279
It's Nepal,
I'm telling you.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.081
Bet me.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.182

Daddio?

09:52.859 --> 09:56.928
Nope.

09:56.930 --> 10:01.633
Oh, hmmmm.

10:03.870 --> 10:11.076
You are correct, Arielle,
and I was wrong.

10:11.078 --> 10:14.512
Next time though, sweetie,

10:14.514 --> 10:17.282
Ow.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.917

pull together a party for you.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.104
It's fine, Dad.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.006
Yeah, but it's
your sweet sixteen.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.642
If you say sweet
sixteen one more time,

10:43.644 --> 10:45.543
you are gonna
get a karate chop.

learned my lesson there.

Christian boy like?

10:55.022 --> 10:57.455
Dark.

10:57.457 --> 11:01.926
Something out of
a detective novel.

11:01.928 --> 11:05.630
Smells nice
enough though.

something happen?

11:06.900 --> 11:07.899
No.

We're always straight
with each other.

11:09.036 --> 11:09.934
I know, Dad.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.703
Not about this,
please don't make me.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.004
I'd never
make you.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.006
OK, good, because I cannot
talk about this with you.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.375
You can't talk to me about the
nothing that didn't happen?

11:17.377 --> 11:18.877
Correct.

a hold of her, right?

13:26.873 --> 13:29.974
Yeah, I think so.

You know, last
time we tried that.

she bailed.

that was years ago.

to see her, Dad.

you to try.

22:09.662 --> 22:14.999
So much you
don't even know.

22:18.271 --> 22:20.771
So you had
a boyfriend?

22:20.773 --> 22:23.107
Ha, no!

22:23.109 --> 22:24.175
No?

22:24.177 --> 22:25.509
No.

22:34.020 --> 22:40.725
Well, I almost, there's this boy
but he's not very right for me.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.993
Why?

22:42.995 --> 22:45.062
He's trouble.

22:45.064 --> 22:47.631
Trouble, isn't that what
being a teenager's all about?

22:49.969 --> 22:51.502
What's he like?

22:55.742 --> 22:59.443
Intense.

22:59.445 --> 23:01.879
Confident.

23:03.449 --> 23:06.417
I'm pretty sure he left a
dead racoon on the porch.

23:06.419 --> 23:09.453
I beg
your pardon?

23:09.455 --> 23:11.155
He did what?

23:11.157 --> 23:16.894
(laughter)

23:19.699 --> 23:23.501
I should try Dad again on
the CB and see if he's OK.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.736
I wish
you wouldn't.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.439
Why not?

23:28.441 --> 23:31.275
Try and
understand, OK?

23:31.277 --> 23:33.277
This is a lot.

23:33.279 --> 23:35.446
But he should
know you're here.

23:35.448 --> 23:38.716
I know, I'm just, I'm
not ready to see him, OK?

23:38.718 --> 23:45.256
I thought I was, but being
here, baby steps, OK?

23:47.193 --> 23:48.392
OK.

23:48.394 --> 23:51.162
OK.

23:51.164 --> 23:53.764
But wait, Mom,
you just got here.

23:53.766 --> 23:58.102
Yeah, no, I got a hotel
room nearby in Fairview.

23:58.104 --> 24:01.539
I'm not
going anywhere.

24:01.541 --> 24:04.308
I will see
you again soon.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.410
I promise.

24:06.412 --> 24:08.913
OK Mom.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.981
Thanks.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.082
This was nice.

24:12.084 --> 24:18.155
(music plays)

24:18.157 --> 24:20.357
I love you
my dear.

24:20.359 --> 24:24.028
So, so much.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.096
(music plays)

24:32.271 --> 24:34.405
Happy Birthday.

24:34.407 --> 24:36.640
Thanks.

24:36.642 --> 24:41.479
(music plays)

24:41.481 --> 24:43.714
I love you too.

24:52.091 --> 24:56.627
(music plays)

24:56.629 --> 25:01.765
So cake for breakfast, is
it everything you hoped for?

25:01.767 --> 25:05.736
You getting home safely,
that was the best gift of all.

25:05.738 --> 25:10.975
Yeah, so weird, snow
kicking up like that.

25:10.977 --> 25:18.015
And you here alone at
night, and you survived.

25:18.017 --> 25:21.485
How'd
you do it?

25:21.487 --> 25:25.422
Just kept
busy I guess.

25:25.424 --> 25:27.124
I'll get it,
you stay.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.459
You sure?

25:28.461 --> 25:31.362
Uh huh.

25:31.364 --> 25:36.567
I'm sorry I couldn't give
you everything you asked for.

25:36.569 --> 25:39.370
Your mother,
I tried, I really did.

25:39.372 --> 25:40.604
Her number's not
in service anymore,

25:40.606 --> 25:45.743
I sent some
emails, no answer.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.946
(music plays)

25:48.948 --> 25:50.681
That's OK Dad.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.750
(music plays)

26:01.394 --> 26:03.360
(music plays)

26:03.362 --> 26:06.430
(knocking)

26:12.471 --> 26:14.371
(music plays)

26:14.373 --> 26:15.506
What, how did you
know which room?

26:15.508 --> 26:16.574
I didn't.

26:16.576 --> 26:17.775
Let's go out.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.043
You're asking
me out now?

26:19.045 --> 26:20.978
Right now.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.313
And do what?

26:22.315 --> 26:26.083
OK, there's these kids at school
and they hang out at this vacant

26:26.085 --> 26:28.953
lot and drink alcoholic liquor
and indulge in youthful

26:28.955 --> 26:33.791
rebellion, so let's steal their
booze and set something on fire.

26:33.793 --> 26:37.094
Yeah, I think you left a
gift on my porch last night.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.897
I didn't want you
to forget about me,

26:39.899 --> 26:43.534
and jewelry is just so
gouache, don't you agree?

26:43.536 --> 26:45.302
What is your most
immediate problem?

26:45.304 --> 26:47.605
You not getting ready and not
coming out with me, come on.

26:47.607 --> 26:50.007
I can't just leave,
my Dad is.

26:50.009 --> 26:53.711
If my aunt catches me I'm
straight off to juvie,

26:53.713 --> 26:56.780
so you see what
I'm risking for you?

26:56.782 --> 26:59.984
I promise I'll bring
you back safe and sound.

26:59.986 --> 27:02.052
(music plays)

27:46.832 --> 27:50.134
(music plays)

27:50.136 --> 27:52.603
Oh my God.

27:52.605 --> 27:53.837
New guy.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.806
(music plays)

27:55.808 --> 27:57.341
I told them
you'd come.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.342
Hey Deb,
how are you?

27:58.344 --> 27:59.476
I'm Bronwyn.

27:59.478 --> 28:00.744
I know,
this is.

28:00.746 --> 28:02.546
Hey, you need to
meet my man Jay.

28:02.548 --> 28:05.349
He's got that busted motorcycle
you said you could fix up,

28:05.351 --> 28:07.551
remember?

28:16.829 --> 28:18.028
(music plays)

28:18.030 --> 28:20.130
Hey, you came with
Christian right?

28:20.132 --> 28:23.033
He's pretty God damn
hot, and nice, score.

28:23.035 --> 28:26.336
I'm Hailey, or Hales, or Hey.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.371
I know you.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.605
From where?

28:28.607 --> 28:31.809
I'm Arielle Ens.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.711
We were on the
curling team together.

28:33.713 --> 28:35.913
Oh my God, that
was like forever ago.

28:35.915 --> 28:39.016
Hi.

28:39.018 --> 28:41.251
Are you still
being home schooled?

28:41.253 --> 28:42.753
Does it
like suck?

28:42.755 --> 28:46.156
I'm super buzzed on this
maple cough syrup punch

28:46.158 --> 28:48.726
that Bronwyn made,
it is sick as thieves.

28:48.728 --> 28:49.960
Do you want some?

28:49.962 --> 28:52.663
Bronnie, get over
here you dumb bitch.

28:52.665 --> 28:54.732
She's my BFF.

28:54.734 --> 28:57.434
This is
Arielle.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.570
I know
who you are.

28:59.572 --> 29:01.438
Do you
know who I am?

29:01.440 --> 29:04.708
I'm Tim
Bateman's daughter.

29:04.710 --> 29:06.810
OK,
I don't know him.

29:06.812 --> 29:08.612
Yeah, well your
Mom knew him.

29:08.614 --> 29:10.047
Excuse me.

29:10.049 --> 29:15.619
Your mom knew my dad,
like on her back knew him.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.087
It was her mom.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.322
I swear I don't
know what you're.

29:18.324 --> 29:22.693
You need to get out
of here seconds ago.

29:22.695 --> 29:23.727
I don't know.

29:23.729 --> 29:25.028
Too late.

29:25.030 --> 29:27.765
(music plays)

29:27.767 --> 29:30.000
I'll wreck you.

29:30.002 --> 29:34.004
Ha ha!

29:34.006 --> 29:41.145
(music plays)

29:41.147 --> 29:42.179
(music plays)

29:42.181 --> 29:44.448
I shouldn't have left
you alone back there.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.785
I'm sorry.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.620
(sobbing)

29:49.622 --> 29:54.658
(humming)

29:54.660 --> 29:55.926
Hey, what
are you doing?

29:59.265 --> 30:07.337
My mom and I, we used
to write music and sing.

30:07.673 --> 30:10.140
It calms me.

30:10.142 --> 30:11.008
Cool, yeah.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.342
I play a
little harmonica.

30:12.344 --> 30:13.944
Oh that's great,
we should start a band.

30:13.946 --> 30:17.147
I really don't
care right now.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.816
That's fair.

30:18.818 --> 30:21.752
(sobbing)

30:21.754 --> 30:24.121
That girl said my
mom and her dad.

30:24.123 --> 30:29.059
Forget what she said, she's
a soulless wannabe bar star.

30:33.465 --> 30:36.033
Where is
your mom?

30:36.035 --> 30:39.636
She.

30:39.638 --> 30:43.440
She moved away.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.375
A long time ago.

30:48.013 --> 30:54.051
She wasn't, she wasn't
good at the mom stuff.

30:57.690 --> 31:00.157
She was an artist,
a photographer,

31:00.159 --> 31:03.327
musician,
traveled a lot.

31:03.329 --> 31:09.266
Even if, if that went down, it's
got nothing to do with you, OK?

31:09.268 --> 31:11.235
Hey, Arielle.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.336
(siren)

31:12.338 --> 31:15.205
Shit.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.917
Who's the girl?

32:05.090 --> 32:06.657
Who was
the girl?

32:08.661 --> 32:10.694
Calling the cops
was a bit extreme.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.462
You can't even
grasp how worried.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.336
Why did
you go out?

32:22.908 --> 32:25.475
Because he
wanted me to.

32:27.246 --> 32:31.381
No boy ever
looked at me like that.

32:31.383 --> 32:33.684
OK.

32:36.455 --> 32:40.891
OK, regardless I'm
still gonna have to.

32:40.893 --> 32:43.694
Punish me,
ground me, whatever.

32:43.696 --> 32:45.629
I know.

32:48.834 --> 32:50.734
I'm sorry.

32:55.407 --> 33:02.012
(music plays)

33:02.014 --> 33:05.983
I'm so grateful
that you're safe.

33:05.985 --> 33:09.820
If anything ever
happened to you.

33:09.822 --> 33:13.256
I can't even imagine.

33:13.258 --> 33:20.864
(music plays)

33:20.866 --> 33:23.700
(knocking)

33:23.702 --> 33:26.870
Come on,
it's freezing out here.

33:26.872 --> 33:31.241
(music plays)

33:31.243 --> 33:36.480
(music plays)

33:36.482 --> 33:42.986
(music plays)

33:42.988 --> 33:45.222
So, how in
shit are you?

33:45.224 --> 33:48.358
(music plays)

33:48.360 --> 33:50.427
I can't see
you anymore.

33:50.429 --> 33:51.495
Did he say that?

33:51.497 --> 33:55.298
I'm saying it.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.833
I can't.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.068
I can't do that
to him again.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.302
But that doesn't
mean that we can't.

33:59.304 --> 34:04.808
I can't trust
being around you.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.309
I'm not myself.

34:06.311 --> 34:07.978
(music plays)

34:07.980 --> 34:11.581
Maybe you are.

34:11.583 --> 34:19.556
(music plays)

34:19.558 --> 34:22.492
(music plays)

35:40.205 --> 35:41.771
Afternoon.

35:44.643 --> 35:48.311
That'll
be $4.50.

35:52.151 --> 35:53.984
And 50 cents
is your change.

35:53.986 --> 35:55.018
You have a
good day now.

35:55.020 --> 35:57.821
Thank you.

35:57.823 --> 36:01.158
Tim Bateman,
is he the owner?

36:01.160 --> 36:03.927
I suppose.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.128
Is he here?

36:05.130 --> 36:08.832
Could I talk
to him quickly?

36:08.834 --> 36:10.433
Sweetheart,
Tim's my husband.

36:10.435 --> 36:13.203
Passed away
some time ago.

36:13.205 --> 36:14.437
What was it?

36:14.439 --> 36:15.639
I made a
mistake, sorry.

36:15.641 --> 36:16.640
Who are you?

36:16.642 --> 36:18.875
I'm sorry.

36:18.877 --> 36:23.079
(music plays)

36:23.081 --> 36:24.080
Hey,
perfect timing.

36:24.082 --> 36:25.115
Can we go?

36:25.117 --> 36:27.250
I have homework.

36:27.252 --> 36:29.085
Where's your
lady stuff?

36:29.087 --> 36:30.420
They were out.

36:30.422 --> 36:33.490
Oh, are you
kidding me?

36:33.492 --> 36:39.796
(music plays)

36:39.798 --> 36:41.965
What is it?

36:41.967 --> 36:43.700
It's a joke.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.418
(music plays)

37:08.060 --> 37:10.460
(music plays)

37:10.462 --> 37:11.962
Before you say anything

37:11.964 --> 37:13.863
(screaming)

37:13.865 --> 37:14.965
What are
you doing?

37:14.967 --> 37:16.466
Let me out,
you psycho.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.001
I didn't want to spook you, but
I thought this was the only way.

37:18.003 --> 37:20.337
I'm sorry we got pulled over,
but I don't understand why we

37:20.339 --> 37:22.472
can't, I mean, I
really, really like you.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.274
No, you don't, you
don't like me, OK?

37:24.276 --> 37:25.675
The hell I don't.

37:25.677 --> 37:28.812
No, I'm a novelty, I'm a weird
homeschool shut in chick.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.413
Not to me
you're not.

37:30.415 --> 37:33.984
Oh yeah, what do you
like about me then?

37:33.986 --> 37:35.852
You just stepped
over the raccoon.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.387
What?

37:37.389 --> 37:39.055
You wanted to scream
and flail and freak out.

37:39.057 --> 37:41.091
You watched me,
are you insane?

37:41.093 --> 37:44.494
But you couldn't let me win,
and that moment I loved you.

37:49.468 --> 37:53.069
Yeah,
I was watching you.

37:53.071 --> 37:55.705
I can't not.

38:00.112 --> 38:02.612
How long have
you been in here?

38:02.614 --> 38:05.415
I figured farmers
get up early.

38:05.417 --> 38:07.250
God, you're an idiot,
we need to get you out.

38:07.252 --> 38:08.652
Not until you agree
to go out with me.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.420
That is the
hypothermia talking.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.255
I'm not leaving until
you say yes, that's it,

38:12.257 --> 38:14.524
so my
life's in your.

38:17.829 --> 38:20.830
Bluff called.

38:24.036 --> 38:25.869
It's the goat's.

38:57.436 --> 39:00.303
God, Dad,
you always do that.

39:00.305 --> 39:02.439
Sorry.

39:02.441 --> 39:05.408
Just had a
little accident.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.853
Lunch in 15.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.055
Yeah, I know.

39:32.738 --> 39:37.040
(phone vibrates)

39:53.392 --> 39:57.961
I just wanted to, we
never actually had

39:57.963 --> 39:59.996
the talk.

39:59.998 --> 40:03.733
(laughter)

40:03.735 --> 40:05.068
Seriously?

40:05.070 --> 40:06.703
Well.

40:06.705 --> 40:10.073
Dad, I'm eating
stew over here.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.142
You and the
Glancer boy.

40:12.144 --> 40:13.209
Christian?

40:13.211 --> 40:14.711
Are you and him?

40:14.713 --> 40:19.649
We had a very heavy make out
session in the cooler, yeah.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.751
OK.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.120
Always be
straight, right?

40:24.122 --> 40:27.090
Right.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.292
Well he's the reason
that you got in trouble.

40:29.294 --> 40:32.095
Dad, he made a huge romantic
gesture and risked freezing to

40:32.097 --> 40:33.930
death just to see me,
what am I supposed to do,

40:33.932 --> 40:35.698
not make out with
him in the cooler?

40:35.700 --> 40:37.534
The boy is dangerous,
I just don't want to

40:37.536 --> 40:39.436
see you make
a huge mistake.

40:39.438 --> 40:42.138
Isn't that what being a
teenager's all about?

40:44.009 --> 40:46.910
And can we avoid the talk,
because I know about the birds

40:46.912 --> 40:49.379
and the bees and the
condoms and the trees.

40:49.381 --> 40:50.780
The what?

40:50.782 --> 40:54.584
Nothing, it's just a clever
rhyme, Dad, let it go.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.987
OK.

41:02.260 --> 41:04.093
(knocking)

41:16.475 --> 41:18.842
Ever heard of
beaver farming?

41:18.844 --> 41:20.977
I mean farming
isn't really accurate.

41:20.979 --> 41:23.379
We breed them.

41:23.381 --> 41:26.616
Loan or sell them to customers
who want their creek dammed on

41:26.618 --> 41:29.285
their property,
stuff like that.

41:29.287 --> 41:31.754
I can't imagine
living out here,

41:31.756 --> 41:37.427
just so out of the loop
with the rest of the world.

41:37.429 --> 41:41.564
Why are you
here, Hailey?

41:41.566 --> 41:44.667
Bronwyn found out you
were at her family's store,

41:44.669 --> 41:46.703
you were snooping
around about her dad.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.571
God.

41:48.573 --> 41:52.175
So she's
super pissed.

41:52.177 --> 41:58.014
Like wants to
kill you pissed.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.683
Why?

42:00.685 --> 42:03.620
I don't understand.

42:03.622 --> 42:05.955
Why do you think
your mom left?

42:11.029 --> 42:15.231
My dad said it was
some kind of a breakdown,

42:15.233 --> 42:18.368
their marriage
wasn't great,

42:18.370 --> 42:21.170
she missed
city life, traveling.

42:25.510 --> 42:28.378
Tell me what
you know,

42:28.380 --> 42:30.880
please.

42:38.423 --> 42:42.225
Doesn't have
to be a race.

42:42.227 --> 42:44.360
Arielle might
be back soon.

42:44.362 --> 42:46.663
She'll ask
questions.

42:50.535 --> 42:52.635
And would it be the
worst thing in the world,

42:52.637 --> 42:54.837
if you tell
her the truth.

43:00.378 --> 43:02.779
Douglas is dead.

43:02.781 --> 43:05.014
Four and a half years.

43:05.016 --> 43:06.683
I know.

43:06.685 --> 43:11.921
The other day at your place
when I slipped on the ice,

43:11.923 --> 43:14.524
that was the
day I decided.

43:14.526 --> 43:16.693
Decided what?

43:16.695 --> 43:22.932
That it was time to
stop sulking in the past.

43:22.934 --> 43:26.869
I'm glad
you're over it.

43:26.871 --> 43:27.904
I've really
got to go.

43:27.906 --> 43:30.139
You can
talk to me.

43:30.141 --> 43:32.075
About her.

43:32.077 --> 43:34.611
Your wife.

43:34.613 --> 43:37.113
Why would I
want to do that?

43:50.095 --> 43:52.862
(music plays)

43:52.864 --> 43:55.064
Hey there, Mr. Ans.

43:55.066 --> 43:58.034
Dropping off more
dairy product, were you?

43:58.036 --> 44:05.475
(music plays)

44:05.477 --> 44:07.477
(music plays)

44:07.479 --> 44:09.612
Stay away
from her.

44:09.614 --> 44:15.885
Tell you what Dad, I'll stay
away from her, if you tell her.

44:15.887 --> 44:18.855
I'm around
like what, a week?

44:18.857 --> 44:21.991
It's amazing how many people
just offer shit up about you.

44:21.993 --> 44:23.760
Weird loner,
wife ran off.

44:23.762 --> 44:25.828
Keeps his
daughter locked up.

44:33.571 --> 44:35.638
(music plays)

44:42.580 --> 44:44.213
Gotta
let her go, Dad.

44:44.215 --> 44:47.216
Sooner or later.

44:47.218 --> 44:51.220
(music plays)

44:51.222 --> 44:53.790
So it's true.

44:56.094 --> 45:00.129
My mom and Bronwyn's dad
were sleeping together.

45:00.131 --> 45:04.434
And then she broke it off,
so that's why Mr. Bateman,

45:04.436 --> 45:07.170
you know,

45:07.172 --> 45:09.338
killed himself.

45:10.275 --> 45:14.711
He couldn't take it,
not being with her.

45:14.713 --> 45:18.448
Is this what the
whole town thinks?

45:18.450 --> 45:20.950
Could be bullshit
though, right?

45:20.952 --> 45:23.953
I mean,
so long ago.

45:23.955 --> 45:26.723
He's dead, and your
mom's not here, so,

45:26.725 --> 45:30.493
who knows.

45:30.495 --> 45:33.996
My advice,
just forget about it.

45:33.998 --> 45:38.401
Look forward,
life's too short.

45:39.738 --> 45:41.604
Yeah.

45:41.606 --> 45:46.142
(music plays)

45:46.144 --> 45:52.181
Thank you Hailey,
for being so nice to me.

45:54.586 --> 45:57.220
Avoid town, OK?

45:57.222 --> 45:58.855
OK?

45:58.857 --> 46:01.424
I mean Bronwyn's
my best friend and all,

46:01.426 --> 46:07.029
but she's crazy,
straight up.

46:07.031 --> 46:13.603
(music plays)

46:13.605 --> 46:19.475
(music plays)

46:19.477 --> 46:21.511
Yeah,
kids no good.

46:22.714 --> 46:27.383
Anything you can
tell me about him.

46:27.385 --> 46:31.120
Yeah, well how do you want
me to make it up to you?

46:33.024 --> 46:35.324
Yeah,
I read your ticket.

46:35.326 --> 46:39.295
(laughter)

46:39.297 --> 46:45.835
Well, I guess that I am
going to have to plead guilty

46:45.837 --> 46:51.274
and hope for
mercy from the court.

46:51.276 --> 46:54.210
(laughter)

46:54.212 --> 46:55.812
Yeah.

46:55.814 --> 46:57.613
Yeah,
that could be arranged.

46:57.615 --> 47:00.550
(laughter)

47:00.552 --> 47:02.618
(music plays)

47:16.134 --> 47:19.302
Hey.

47:19.304 --> 47:22.138
My precious girl.

47:24.042 --> 47:25.741
How much
time do we have?

47:25.743 --> 47:26.809
We have a
few hours,

47:26.811 --> 47:29.045
he's just in
Neville helping a client.

47:29.047 --> 47:30.079
OK.

47:30.081 --> 47:31.347
Where
did you park?

47:31.349 --> 47:32.849
Just
up the road.

47:32.851 --> 47:34.584
It's safe.

47:34.586 --> 47:36.719
I don't like all this,
it's like I'm lying to him.

47:36.721 --> 47:39.422
We don't do that
to one another.

47:39.424 --> 47:43.893
I know it's hard,
and I appreciate your trust.

47:48.800 --> 47:52.635
So dad did get a hold of you to
say that I wanted to see you.

47:52.637 --> 47:54.904
That's right.

47:57.675 --> 47:59.942
He told
me he didn't.

47:59.944 --> 48:01.844
Hm, well that's.

48:01.846 --> 48:04.180
Why would he say
that, do you think?

48:09.120 --> 48:10.853
This is your
father's house.

48:10.855 --> 48:11.954
I don't want
to disparage.

48:11.956 --> 48:13.055
Oh my God,
why is everyone

48:13.057 --> 48:14.891
pussyfooting around
me about everything?

48:14.893 --> 48:16.692
What do you
want me to say?

48:16.694 --> 48:19.295
He gets forgetful
when he drinks.

48:19.297 --> 48:21.497
Drinks?

48:21.499 --> 48:23.399
Dad?

48:23.401 --> 48:27.470
Do we really have to do all
this unpleasant business now?

48:31.409 --> 48:33.175
So what are you
trying to tell me,

48:33.177 --> 48:34.710
that my father's
like a secret drunk?

48:34.712 --> 48:36.545
Is that what
you're trying to say?

48:36.547 --> 48:39.315
All I'm saying is that when you
were younger, the second after

48:39.317 --> 48:44.020
your head hit the pillow he'd
be in the bottle or at the bar.

48:46.491 --> 48:49.458
I don't
believe you.

48:49.460 --> 48:52.929
If he's gotten
help, that's great.

49:04.776 --> 49:06.676
Did you have
an affair?

49:06.678 --> 49:10.846
Yes.

49:10.848 --> 49:13.149
And that's
why you left?

49:13.151 --> 49:15.084
What did
he tell you?

49:15.086 --> 49:19.322
He didn't, but apparently
the whole town knows.

49:21.292 --> 49:26.228
Everything changed when your
father and I got married.

49:26.230 --> 49:31.200
Before that, we talked
travel, seeing the world.

49:31.202 --> 49:37.373
And then, all he wanted
was to keep me here.

49:37.375 --> 49:40.042
I was miserable.

49:40.044 --> 49:45.181
Then you came along,
things were better for a while,

49:45.183 --> 49:52.855
but Tim Bateman and I,
we fell hard for each other.

49:55.093 --> 49:57.326
You loved him
more than Dad.

50:02.133 --> 50:05.001
But you
ended things.

50:05.003 --> 50:08.037
After everyone
in town found out,

50:08.039 --> 50:11.073
I humiliated
your father.

50:11.075 --> 50:13.609
Tim's family.

50:13.611 --> 50:17.079
I tried to make things
right with your dad,

50:17.081 --> 50:20.549
I went
back to him.

50:20.551 --> 50:22.818
But Tim,

50:22.820 --> 50:26.355
he couldn't
take it.

50:26.357 --> 50:33.295
They found him in his garage
with the engine still running.

50:33.297 --> 50:35.464
And who
was to blame?

50:35.466 --> 50:37.533
(music plays)

50:51.482 --> 50:53.549
(music plays)

50:58.790 --> 51:02.358
Is that your piece of
crap parked over there?

51:02.360 --> 51:04.326
Hello.

51:04.328 --> 51:08.097
You've got 30 seconds or
I tow your hunk of junk.

51:08.099 --> 51:10.232
That's my big crime
against my humanity, is it?

51:10.234 --> 51:11.834
Because I have a crowbar
in my trunk if you want to

51:11.836 --> 51:13.502
smash out
my tail lights.

51:13.504 --> 51:15.137
You're on a tight leash
while you're visiting here,

51:15.139 --> 51:17.306
Mr. Ross,
remember that.

51:17.308 --> 51:19.775
Huh,
you know my name already.

51:19.777 --> 51:20.643
Probably from
the other night

51:20.645 --> 51:22.645
when you pulled
me and Arielle over.

51:22.647 --> 51:23.913
You're on parole.

51:23.915 --> 51:26.082
It's my business
to know you.

51:26.084 --> 51:27.516
One more slip and
it's back to the city

51:27.518 --> 51:29.752
and straight into
juvenile detention.

51:29.754 --> 51:30.986
You want that?

51:30.988 --> 51:33.222
Is this his idea,
her dad?

51:33.224 --> 51:36.092
Did he ask you
for a favor?

51:36.094 --> 51:40.629
Or maybe you guys do
each other favors.

51:40.631 --> 51:41.864
She's a good girl.

51:41.866 --> 51:43.933
We all want her
to stay that way.

51:43.935 --> 51:45.201
Really?

51:45.203 --> 51:46.268
Because
from what I hear,

51:46.270 --> 51:48.571
she's not even
allowed off the compound.

51:48.573 --> 51:49.572
Farm.

51:49.574 --> 51:51.440
Tell me three
things about her.

51:51.442 --> 51:53.109
Three.

51:53.111 --> 51:56.112
Her name's Arielle,
I'll give you that one.

51:56.114 --> 51:58.747
Come on constable,
two more.

51:58.749 --> 52:01.784
Anything?

52:01.786 --> 52:02.985
So I'm
gonna go now.

52:02.987 --> 52:05.454
You'll go when
I say you can go.

52:05.456 --> 52:09.391
He's boning my aunt by
the way, rather loudly.

52:19.737 --> 52:24.240
That old dress of mine,
the red one with the lace,

52:24.242 --> 52:25.975
you would look
so pretty in that,

52:25.977 --> 52:27.776
with your hair
done like this.

52:27.778 --> 52:29.812
What dress?

52:29.814 --> 52:33.516
There's an old box of
dresses up in the attic.

52:33.518 --> 52:35.251
I told your father
to let you have them

52:35.253 --> 52:37.419
when you got
a little older.

52:37.421 --> 52:40.523
They'd all
fit you now.

52:40.525 --> 52:44.793
Let's see.

52:44.795 --> 52:47.329
You look
so pretty.

52:50.535 --> 52:54.470
So grown up.

53:02.580 --> 53:07.249
Thank you for
telling me all that.

53:07.251 --> 53:09.185
You are a
rare treasure,

53:09.187 --> 53:13.689
thanking me for being
the world's worst mother.

53:13.691 --> 53:18.427
Sometimes I feel like I'm
missing some pieces of my life.

53:18.429 --> 53:20.396
Hey,

53:20.398 --> 53:23.432
take a
look around.

53:23.434 --> 53:26.936
There is so much
more than this.

53:26.938 --> 53:33.175
There's a whole world out there,
and I hope you get to see it.

53:33.177 --> 53:36.645
Why wouldn't I?

53:39.951 --> 53:41.550
I'll see
you soon.

53:41.552 --> 53:43.686
OK.

53:52.597 --> 53:54.663
(music plays)

55:22.153 --> 55:24.219
(music plays)

55:29.727 --> 55:31.860
Hey pal.

55:31.862 --> 55:33.962
Yeah.

55:37.101 --> 55:41.003
OK.

55:41.005 --> 55:43.839
Yeah, no,
I can handle it.

55:43.841 --> 55:45.441
Thanks Wendel.

55:45.443 --> 55:50.779
I appreciate
the offer though.

55:50.781 --> 55:53.982
OK pal.

55:53.984 --> 55:56.518
Yeah.

55:59.323 --> 56:01.156
What are
you doing?

56:01.158 --> 56:02.691
The one that
died tested positive

56:02.693 --> 56:03.826
for an
infectious disease.

56:03.828 --> 56:05.661
You're gonna murder
them without telling me?

56:05.663 --> 56:07.196
I thought it would be
easier if you didn't know.

56:07.198 --> 56:10.099
For who,
for you?

56:10.101 --> 56:13.035
The water is toxic,
do you want them to suffer?

56:15.339 --> 56:17.172
There has to
be another way.

56:17.174 --> 56:19.341
Well there isn't.

56:19.343 --> 56:21.944
You shouldn't
have got so attached.

56:27.551 --> 56:30.786
Go back up
to the house.

56:30.788 --> 56:32.354
It'll be quick.

56:32.356 --> 56:34.089
Go!

56:41.065 --> 56:44.266
You don't
want to see this.

56:44.268 --> 56:46.335
(music plays)

56:52.710 --> 56:55.444
(gunshot)

56:55.446 --> 56:58.714
(sobbing)

56:58.716 --> 57:00.783
(music plays)

57:06.757 --> 57:08.056
(music plays)

57:08.058 --> 57:15.364
(sobbing)

57:15.366 --> 57:18.767
(gunshot)

57:18.769 --> 57:22.004
(sobbing)

57:22.006 --> 57:24.072
(music plays)

58:27.671 --> 58:35.644
(music plays)

58:38.816 --> 58:43.385
(sobbing)

58:43.387 --> 58:45.187
Arielle?

58:52.162 --> 58:56.164
He killed them,

58:56.166 --> 59:01.303
right in
front of me.

59:06.677 --> 59:10.379
OK, you just
let it out now.

59:10.381 --> 59:12.648
You let
it out.

59:22.860 --> 59:25.661
What is it
sweetheart?

59:27.598 --> 59:29.765
Why are
you here?

59:31.802 --> 59:35.237
I'm here because you
asked for me to be here.

59:35.239 --> 59:39.041
(laughing)

59:39.043 --> 59:43.312
I am here for you,
and that is all that matters.

59:47.751 --> 59:51.153
Maybe
you're ready.

59:51.155 --> 59:55.757
Maybe you're ready to
hear about the past.

59:55.759 --> 59:57.626
About the lies.

59:57.628 --> 1:00:00.162
What lies,
you left.

1:00:00.164 --> 1:00:03.332
About the accident.

1:00:03.334 --> 1:00:05.500
What accident?

1:00:05.502 --> 1:00:08.470
Sweetheart,

1:00:08.472 --> 1:00:11.006
you drowned.

1:00:13.410 --> 1:00:16.545
Right here.

1:00:16.547 --> 1:00:20.115
You were five.

1:00:20.117 --> 1:00:21.750
Five years old.

1:00:26.423 --> 1:00:27.889
The farm
was struggling.

1:00:27.891 --> 1:00:32.527
I had to pick up a job in
town, at the drug store.

1:00:32.529 --> 1:00:36.064
That left your father
to take care of you.

1:00:36.066 --> 1:00:41.803
He tried his best, but that
unhappiness inside of him, it

1:00:41.805 --> 1:00:47.342
caused him to drink, it caused
him to go inside of himself.

1:00:47.344 --> 1:00:49.411
(music plays)

1:01:04.128 --> 1:01:10.432
Your little heart,
it stopped for nine minutes.

1:01:10.434 --> 1:01:14.770
I thought
we lost you.

1:01:14.772 --> 1:01:18.874
And then a
miracle happened.

1:01:18.876 --> 1:01:22.544
And my prayers were answered,
and I made a promise,

1:01:22.546 --> 1:01:24.546
I made a promise
that I would stay

1:01:24.548 --> 1:01:26.815
and I would be
with your father,

1:01:26.817 --> 1:01:30.419
and I promised to be the
best mother that I could be.

1:01:30.421 --> 1:01:33.789
(music plays)

1:01:33.791 --> 1:01:38.226
Then the affair got out,
and Tim,

1:01:38.228 --> 1:01:41.730
he killed himself.

1:01:41.732 --> 1:01:46.735
And your father,
he sent me away, Arielle.

1:01:46.737 --> 1:01:48.503
Do you understand?

1:01:48.505 --> 1:01:51.973
He sent me away.

1:01:51.975 --> 1:01:58.080
And I am so sorry that you
were never told the truth,

1:01:58.082 --> 1:02:02.250
and that I didn't have the
courage to take you with me.

1:02:02.252 --> 1:02:06.621
(sobbing)

1:02:06.623 --> 1:02:09.391
You need to get
out of here, Arielle.

1:02:09.393 --> 1:02:15.597
This place
is killing you.

1:02:15.599 --> 1:02:17.799
I can't leave.

1:02:17.801 --> 1:02:19.835
He'll destroy you.

1:02:19.837 --> 1:02:22.471
He will never
let you leave.

1:02:22.473 --> 1:02:24.339
He will always
find a reason.

1:02:24.341 --> 1:02:27.876
And you, you're a kind hearted
girl and you will take his

1:02:27.878 --> 1:02:30.245
orders, and then one
day you'll wake up.

1:02:30.247 --> 1:02:36.952
(music plays)

1:02:36.954 --> 1:02:39.254
I'm not
leaving again,

1:02:39.256 --> 1:02:43.191
I'm not leaving until
you're ready to leave.

1:02:43.193 --> 1:02:45.260
(music plays)

1:03:18.629 --> 1:03:19.694
¶ I ¶

1:03:22.866 --> 1:03:28.503

1:03:28.505 --> 1:03:32.007
¶ I ¶

1:03:32.009 --> 1:03:37.846
¶ Walked away ¶

1:03:37.848 --> 1:03:41.183
¶ Who am I? ¶

1:03:41.185 --> 1:03:43.051
How did you know
which window was mine?

1:03:43.053 --> 1:03:45.420
(music plays)

1:03:45.422 --> 1:03:48.523
I didn't.

1:03:48.525 --> 1:03:51.259
How did you know
my aunt was out?

1:03:51.261 --> 1:03:52.661
I didn't.

1:03:52.663 --> 1:03:54.729
(music plays)

1:04:18.755 --> 1:04:23.225
¶ You set me free ¶

1:04:23.227 --> 1:04:27.929
Have you ever?

1:04:27.931 --> 1:04:31.566
That's why I'm
here, genius.

1:04:31.568 --> 1:04:33.068
Are you?

1:04:33.070 --> 1:04:36.371
(music plays)

1:04:36.373 --> 1:04:43.478
¶ Remind you not to stay, run
away, help me in your eyes ¶

1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:50.552
¶ Closer, didn't want to fall,

1:04:50.554 --> 1:04:58.627

¶ I don't
know how to say ¶

1:05:05.669 --> 1:05:10.038
¶ Ran away ¶

1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:18.113
¶ I find a quieter place
to lay my head down ¶

1:05:42.572 --> 1:05:49.511
(music plays)

1:05:49.513 --> 1:05:51.012
Did you
even ask them?

1:05:51.014 --> 1:05:52.580
Ask them what?

1:05:52.582 --> 1:05:54.249
If they,
Elizabeth.

1:05:54.251 --> 1:05:56.384
It doesn't take a
rocket scientist, John.

1:05:56.386 --> 1:06:00.388
Your little harlot in her
underwear eating my rocky road.

1:06:00.390 --> 1:06:02.324
Respectfully, Elizabeth,
watch your tone.

1:06:02.326 --> 1:06:06.328
Respectfully John,
you've raised a slut.

1:06:09.866 --> 1:06:13.168
That was overly
harsh, I apologize.

1:06:19.643 --> 1:06:22.644
It's not the
girl's fault,

1:06:22.646 --> 1:06:26.247
look who her
mother was.

1:06:26.249 --> 1:06:29.351
Just following in her
footsteps I suppose.

1:06:36.226 --> 1:06:40.228
Jon.

1:06:40.230 --> 1:06:47.435
(music plays)

1:06:47.437 --> 1:06:51.639
(music plays)

1:06:51.641 --> 1:06:55.210
So how long?

1:06:55.212 --> 1:06:59.981
You and Miss
Glancer, how long?

1:06:59.983 --> 1:07:01.683
Where did
you get that?

1:07:01.685 --> 1:07:05.120
Why didn't
you tell me?

1:07:05.122 --> 1:07:06.254
It wasn't serious.

1:07:06.256 --> 1:07:10.358
A funny way to be
straight with me.

1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:11.659
You went up
to the attic?

1:07:11.661 --> 1:07:13.128
Yes.

1:07:13.130 --> 1:07:14.362
You need
to change.

1:07:14.364 --> 1:07:15.397
I just did.

1:07:15.399 --> 1:07:17.799
Change back.

1:07:17.801 --> 1:07:21.703
This,
what is this?

1:07:21.705 --> 1:07:23.972
This, Jon,

1:07:23.974 --> 1:07:27.809
this is me,

1:07:27.811 --> 1:07:31.579
seeing the truth
for the first time.

1:07:38.955 --> 1:07:43.425
You've hidden my
whole life from me.

1:07:43.427 --> 1:07:47.128
Anything and
everything I've ever done

1:07:47.130 --> 1:07:48.129
has been to
protect you.

1:07:48.131 --> 1:07:52.233
You're pathetic.

1:07:52.235 --> 1:07:55.203
What other secrets
are you keeping, Jon?

1:07:55.205 --> 1:07:58.973
(music plays)

1:07:58.975 --> 1:08:03.878
You stop calling me
Jon, and go change.

1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:05.146
And you take
out that braid.

1:08:05.148 --> 1:08:06.915
Mom said I'd look good like
this, and she was right.

1:08:06.917 --> 1:08:09.417
You can't talk like that, do you
know what people will think?

1:08:09.419 --> 1:08:11.453
I'm becoming the crazy town
slut, just like my mother.

1:08:11.455 --> 1:08:14.456
Yes, damn it,
just like her!

1:08:14.458 --> 1:08:16.524
(music plays)

1:08:20.931 --> 1:08:22.997
(music plays)

1:08:28.405 --> 1:08:30.505
Oh, were you expecting
me to run out of here,

1:08:30.507 --> 1:08:32.941
crying like
a little girl?

1:08:32.943 --> 1:08:35.009
(music plays)

1:09:10.647 --> 1:09:12.714

1:11:11.034 --> 1:11:12.934

1:11:12.936 --> 1:11:15.903
You can't
have her!

1:11:15.905 --> 1:11:20.408
You hear me?

1:11:20.410 --> 1:11:22.076
I won't
let you.

1:11:22.078 --> 1:11:24.145
(music plays)

1:11:39.596 --> 1:11:41.663
What?

1:11:41.665 --> 1:11:42.697
You look.

1:11:42.699 --> 1:11:43.865
What, weird?

1:11:43.867 --> 1:11:45.166
Sexy.

1:11:45.168 --> 1:11:46.801
I was
gonna say sexy.

1:11:50.407 --> 1:11:53.908
So where do
you want to go?

1:11:53.910 --> 1:11:56.010
I need a drink.

1:12:00.750 --> 1:12:03.551
OK then.

1:12:03.553 --> 1:12:05.620
(music plays)

1:13:23.733 --> 1:13:25.800
(music plays)

1:13:26.002 --> 1:13:31.372
I will have a pina colada,
followed by a White Russian,

1:13:31.374 --> 1:13:35.143
finishing off with
your finest pinot noire.

1:13:35.145 --> 1:13:38.946
Excellent
choice, madam.

1:13:38.948 --> 1:13:41.616
Your drinks.

1:13:41.618 --> 1:13:43.684
(music plays)

1:13:59.602 --> 1:14:01.669

Your dad
and my aunt.

1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:47.248
(laughing)

1:14:47.250 --> 1:14:49.484
I never want there to be
secrets like that between us.

1:14:49.486 --> 1:14:51.652
Me neither.

1:14:56.259 --> 1:15:00.361
Six months ago I beat up this
random kid, and he turned out to

1:15:00.363 --> 1:15:01.863
be like,

1:15:04.767 --> 1:15:08.870
you know,
mentally handicapped.

1:15:08.872 --> 1:15:12.740
It was a stupid
initiation thing,

1:15:12.742 --> 1:15:15.142
and I broke
his collarbone,

1:15:15.144 --> 1:15:19.881
and he now has permanent
hearing loss in one of his ears.

1:15:22.552 --> 1:15:23.985
And the guys who
dared me to do it,

1:15:23.987 --> 1:15:29.624
I didn't even like all that
much, I was just bored, alone.

1:15:29.626 --> 1:15:31.759
And those assholes,
they picked him out,

1:15:31.761 --> 1:15:35.763
they knew he
was, you know.

1:15:35.765 --> 1:15:37.899
And they thought I did too, or
they thought maybe I wouldn't go

1:15:37.901 --> 1:15:41.869
through with it, or I don't
know what they thought.

1:15:41.871 --> 1:15:46.040
I hurt him,

1:15:46.042 --> 1:15:48.075
so bad.

1:15:49.679 --> 1:15:55.016
It's the worst
thing I've ever done.

1:15:55.018 --> 1:15:59.053
There was, at my sentencing
I was given a chance

1:15:59.055 --> 1:16:01.055
to say something,
to apologize, and

1:16:03.293 --> 1:16:04.525
I couldn't,

1:16:04.527 --> 1:16:09.997
because saying I'm
sorry would just be words,

1:16:09.999 --> 1:16:13.968
and it's too late, because
he's even more messed up now.

1:16:18.474 --> 1:16:23.311
That's, I wanted to
tell you, that's it.

1:16:23.313 --> 1:16:25.980
I don't deserve
anything good.

1:16:25.982 --> 1:16:31.452
(music plays)

1:16:31.454 --> 1:16:35.790

1:16:52.075 --> 1:16:54.875
(knocking)

1:17:05.288 --> 1:17:09.890
I, I'm sorry.

1:17:09.892 --> 1:17:14.395
When it comes to
Arielle, I get.

1:17:14.397 --> 1:17:18.466
I feel horrible
about scaring you.

1:17:18.468 --> 1:17:23.070
Can you
forgive me?

1:17:23.072 --> 1:17:26.474
I saw your light on, and I
thought that was your way of

1:17:26.476 --> 1:17:29.777
saying that
you forgave me.

1:17:29.779 --> 1:17:34.115
OK, I see that I have
some work to do here.

1:17:34.117 --> 1:17:37.652
It's just been a while since
I've been in a relationship.

1:17:37.654 --> 1:17:41.722
That's what
this is to you?

1:17:41.724 --> 1:17:46.293
Well,
yeah, yeah.

1:17:46.295 --> 1:17:50.464
I mean, I

1:17:50.466 --> 1:17:51.899
I like you.

1:17:51.901 --> 1:17:54.635
John, I went to the police
station this evening to file

1:17:54.637 --> 1:17:58.005
assault charges
against you.

1:17:58.007 --> 1:18:00.875
The officer who
took my statement,

1:18:00.877 --> 1:18:03.344
such a lovely
young woman.

1:18:03.346 --> 1:18:08.115
Such a kind soul, a
Constable Ruth Shocka.

1:18:08.117 --> 1:18:11.585
Are you familiar John,
with Constable Ruth Shocka?

1:18:11.587 --> 1:18:14.055
Because she seems
very familiar with you.

1:18:14.057 --> 1:18:20.828
I dare say she may loathe you
even more than I loathe you.

1:18:20.830 --> 1:18:23.698
After learning of
your familiarity with

1:18:23.700 --> 1:18:29.136
Constable Ruth Shocka,
I withdrew my complaint.

1:18:29.138 --> 1:18:33.607
It dawned on me how
sad your existence is.

1:18:33.609 --> 1:18:37.778
How isolated
you are, secretive.

1:18:37.780 --> 1:18:42.917
Sad, really.

1:18:42.919 --> 1:18:45.319
But let me
be clear.

1:18:45.321 --> 1:18:52.560
Stay away from me, or else
I or Constable Ruth Shocka

1:18:52.562 --> 1:18:55.730
will
destroy you.

1:18:55.732 --> 1:18:57.732
Pathetic louche.

1:19:03.439 --> 1:19:08.743
And that is
not for you.

1:19:15.218 --> 1:19:17.284
(music plays)

1:19:23.359 --> 1:19:30.631
(laughing)

1:19:30.633 --> 1:19:37.004
(laughing)

1:19:42.178 --> 1:19:46.280
Can I talk to
you for a second?

1:19:57.894 --> 1:20:05.299
I'm so sorry
about your dad.

1:20:05.301 --> 1:20:09.603
I didn't know.

1:20:09.605 --> 1:20:15.309
I didn't
know anything.

1:20:15.311 --> 1:20:22.483
I hate that my
family caused you pain.

1:20:22.485 --> 1:20:24.318
That's it.

1:20:26.155 --> 1:20:28.989
I'm so
sorry, Bronwyn.

1:20:44.907 --> 1:20:46.106
(bottle smashes)

1:20:46.108 --> 1:20:49.143
You don't ever talk
about him, you hear me?

1:20:49.145 --> 1:20:50.411
Never!

1:20:50.413 --> 1:20:52.913
(music plays)

1:20:52.915 --> 1:20:54.648
(screaming)

1:20:54.650 --> 1:21:02.389
(music plays)

1:21:02.391 --> 1:21:06.560
(screaming)

1:21:06.562 --> 1:21:11.398
(music plays)

1:21:11.400 --> 1:21:14.335
(screaming)

1:21:14.337 --> 1:21:19.006
(music plays)

1:21:19.008 --> 1:21:22.142
Told you we
weren't finished.

1:21:22.144 --> 1:21:25.946
(music plays)

1:21:25.948 --> 1:21:28.015
(phone vibrating)

1:21:36.692 --> 1:21:39.627
Blindsided Arielle.

1:21:39.629 --> 1:21:43.430
Hit her in the back of a head
with a bottle, and she was just

1:21:43.432 --> 1:21:49.036
defending herself, and then
it got crazy, so crazy.

1:21:49.038 --> 1:21:52.006
You have been told repeatedly
to stay away from her.

1:21:52.008 --> 1:21:53.507
All I did was
break them up.

1:21:53.509 --> 1:21:56.210
There was underage drinking,
drugs on the premises,

1:21:56.212 --> 1:21:58.579
which is undoubtedly a
violation of your parole.

1:21:58.581 --> 1:22:01.081
Fine, you know, call my
PO, send me back to juvie,

1:22:01.083 --> 1:22:04.118
get me out of the sticks,
I'm sick of this place.

1:22:12.929 --> 1:22:15.162
What's gonna
happen to her?

1:22:18.801 --> 1:22:20.100
She'll be charged.

1:22:20.102 --> 1:22:25.639
Still a minor, first
offense, community service.

1:22:25.641 --> 1:22:30.577
I thought she was all,
you know, proper and normal.

1:22:30.579 --> 1:22:33.514
I had no idea.

1:22:33.516 --> 1:22:36.784
It was so
messed up.

1:22:36.786 --> 1:22:38.552
You can't
help her.

1:22:38.554 --> 1:22:41.488
All she's ever known is
this one kind of life.

1:22:41.490 --> 1:22:45.693
Lonely existence, until
she finally gets away from.

1:22:45.695 --> 1:22:48.062
Maybe that's what needs to
happen, maybe somebody needs to

1:22:48.064 --> 1:22:50.664
get her the hell
off that farm.

1:22:50.666 --> 1:22:52.132
Maybe.

1:22:52.134 --> 1:22:54.201
But that
won't be easy.

1:22:54.203 --> 1:22:56.136
Her father just
bailed her out.

1:23:14.991 --> 1:23:17.391
We should get you
checked out.

1:23:25.101 --> 1:23:26.834
I mean, you might
have a concussion.

1:23:26.836 --> 1:23:30.037
Like you
know anything.

1:24:25.594 --> 1:24:27.628
(music plays)

1:24:33.069 --> 1:24:35.502
Morning.

1:24:35.504 --> 1:24:41.308
(music plays)

1:24:41.310 --> 1:24:43.877
You look
back to normal.

1:24:43.879 --> 1:24:47.147
You feeling OK?

1:24:47.149 --> 1:24:49.383
Goats are dry.

1:24:49.385 --> 1:24:51.251
No milk.

1:24:51.253 --> 1:24:53.587
That's strange.

1:24:53.589 --> 1:24:57.157
(music plays)

1:24:57.159 --> 1:24:59.493
I'm leaving.

1:24:59.495 --> 1:25:01.061
(music plays)

1:25:01.063 --> 1:25:04.698
What?

1:25:04.700 --> 1:25:10.637
I'm finishing today's chores,
and then that's it, I'm going.

1:25:10.639 --> 1:25:13.073
Where?

1:25:13.075 --> 1:25:15.976
With Christian?

1:25:15.978 --> 1:25:18.912
No, no I don't
think so Arielle.

1:25:18.914 --> 1:25:23.350
You don't
get to decide.

1:25:23.352 --> 1:25:26.120
What the hell happened
to you last night?

1:25:26.122 --> 1:25:27.521
You put that girl
in the hospital.

1:25:27.523 --> 1:25:29.389
Her dad was having
an affair with mom,

1:25:29.391 --> 1:25:31.258
but I don't need
to tell you that.

1:25:31.260 --> 1:25:33.427
All this talk
about your mother.

1:25:33.429 --> 1:25:36.096
You're just not even
going to respond to that.

1:25:36.098 --> 1:25:40.033
So she got
into you somehow.

1:25:40.035 --> 1:25:41.435
No.

1:25:41.437 --> 1:25:46.140
I'm your father and I love
you, but you belong here.

1:25:46.142 --> 1:25:49.910
You don't get to
keep her from me.

1:25:49.912 --> 1:25:53.313
Not anymore.

1:25:53.315 --> 1:25:56.783
You know
I had to.

1:25:56.785 --> 1:25:58.685
Why?

1:25:58.687 --> 1:26:01.455
She was sick.

1:26:01.457 --> 1:26:06.393
She loved you, but something
inside her changed.

1:26:06.395 --> 1:26:09.329
It changed
in her heart.

1:26:09.331 --> 1:26:13.066
Her heart just got
darker and darker.

1:26:13.068 --> 1:26:15.335
No little girl should ever be
separated from her mother,

1:26:15.337 --> 1:26:16.403
except this time.

1:26:16.405 --> 1:26:18.839
This time it
had to happen.

1:26:18.841 --> 1:26:21.508
I had to
send her away.

1:26:21.510 --> 1:26:24.011
(music plays)

1:26:24.013 --> 1:26:27.080
Arielle.

1:26:27.082 --> 1:26:30.250
I lied to you.

1:26:30.252 --> 1:26:32.686
I didn't
look for her.

1:26:32.688 --> 1:26:36.990
I never sent emails,
I never called.

1:26:36.992 --> 1:26:38.625
I didn't try.

1:26:38.627 --> 1:26:41.295
(music plays)

1:26:41.297 --> 1:26:43.597
I never
intended to.

1:26:43.599 --> 1:26:47.534
(music plays)

1:26:47.536 --> 1:26:50.337
Why?

1:26:50.339 --> 1:26:53.307
Because your
mother's dead.

1:26:53.309 --> 1:26:55.576
She took
her own life.

1:26:55.578 --> 1:26:58.412
She drowned.

1:26:58.414 --> 1:27:00.948
Right there
in the pond.

1:27:00.950 --> 1:27:04.051
She drove her
car into it, so.

1:27:04.053 --> 1:27:09.022
(music plays)

1:27:09.024 --> 1:27:10.524
Arielle.

1:27:10.526 --> 1:27:12.526
No.

1:27:12.528 --> 1:27:16.663
You don't
come near me.

1:27:16.665 --> 1:27:19.967
She told me about the
clothes in the attic.

1:27:19.969 --> 1:27:21.468
She braided my.

1:27:21.470 --> 1:27:22.970
Arielle, you were
having nightmares.

1:27:22.972 --> 1:27:25.005
No,
I brought her back.

1:27:25.007 --> 1:27:26.273
Come here.

1:27:26.275 --> 1:27:27.608
Come here,
come here.

1:27:27.610 --> 1:27:31.411
( Sobbing )

1:27:31.413 --> 1:27:34.748
Oh, I love you.

1:27:34.750 --> 1:27:38.018
I love you.

1:27:38.020 --> 1:27:43.423
And as hard as it is to hear,
you're better off without her.

1:27:43.425 --> 1:27:51.031
(music plays)

1:27:51.033 --> 1:27:53.634
Ugh.

1:27:53.636 --> 1:27:57.070
(music plays)

1:27:57.072 --> 1:28:01.608
(music plays)

1:28:01.610 --> 1:28:07.080
(crying)

1:28:07.082 --> 1:28:08.815
Arielle.

1:28:08.817 --> 1:28:12.319
Open the door.

1:28:12.321 --> 1:28:13.954
Arielle, please.

1:28:13.956 --> 1:28:19.559
(pounding)

1:28:19.561 --> 1:28:22.763
(music plays)

1:28:22.765 --> 1:28:27.067
(crying)

1:28:27.069 --> 1:28:32.739
(music plays)

1:28:32.741 --> 1:28:34.808
(crying)

1:28:56.799 --> 1:28:58.865
(music plays)

1:29:04.540 --> 1:29:07.040
Hey.

1:29:07.042 --> 1:29:09.109
(music plays)

1:29:36.805 --> 1:29:38.171
Hey!

1:29:38.173 --> 1:29:40.207
Stop.

1:29:40.209 --> 1:29:42.776
Stop.

1:29:42.778 --> 1:29:50.617
(music plays)

1:29:50.619 --> 1:29:57.858
(music plays)

1:29:57.860 --> 1:30:00.927
(music plays)

1:30:00.929 --> 1:30:03.697
Hi honey.

1:30:03.699 --> 1:30:05.298
Hi.

1:30:05.300 --> 1:30:08.001
You.

1:30:08.003 --> 1:30:10.303
Yes, yes,
I did miss our

1:30:10.305 --> 1:30:13.807
intellectually
stimulating conversations.

1:30:13.809 --> 1:30:16.243
You know, you always did
have a way with words.

1:30:16.245 --> 1:30:18.845
(music plays)

1:30:18.847 --> 1:30:23.850
She turned out beautifully,
Jon, our little Arielle.

1:30:23.852 --> 1:30:29.022
Bright, articulate,
an old caring soul.

1:30:29.024 --> 1:30:32.092
(music plays)

1:30:32.094 --> 1:30:35.629
Just like
her mother.

1:30:35.631 --> 1:30:38.432
You've
lost her, Jon.

1:30:38.434 --> 1:30:40.967
She's leaving you.

1:30:40.969 --> 1:30:45.739
You're gonna die alone
here on this disgusting,

1:30:45.741 --> 1:30:49.643
stench-laden,
life sucking farm.

1:30:49.645 --> 1:30:52.145
You're gonna die alone
with your farm animals,

1:30:52.147 --> 1:30:55.415
and your whores,
and your nothing.

1:30:55.417 --> 1:30:58.885
And your
daughter will be happy.

1:30:58.887 --> 1:31:03.123
She'll step foot
off of this prison,

1:31:03.125 --> 1:31:08.061
and never
ever return.

1:31:08.063 --> 1:31:10.864
(music plays)

1:31:10.866 --> 1:31:14.835
I told you we
weren't finished.

1:31:14.837 --> 1:31:17.437
(laughing)

1:31:17.439 --> 1:31:24.077
(crying)

1:31:24.079 --> 1:31:30.817
(laughing)

1:31:30.819 --> 1:31:34.054
(music plays)

1:31:34.056 --> 1:31:37.624
This
isn't happening.

1:31:37.626 --> 1:31:40.460
You're not here.

1:31:40.462 --> 1:31:42.095
Because?

1:31:42.097 --> 1:31:45.265
(laughing)

1:31:45.267 --> 1:31:51.438
Because your rotting corpse is
at the bottom of that pond,

1:31:51.440 --> 1:31:55.175
because I
put you there.

1:31:55.177 --> 1:32:01.414
(music plays)

1:32:01.416 --> 1:32:03.316
Sweetheart.

1:32:03.318 --> 1:32:08.588
(music plays)

1:32:08.590 --> 1:32:13.793
Sweetheart,
you were in danger.

1:32:13.795 --> 1:32:16.563
You put
me in danger.

1:32:16.565 --> 1:32:18.632
I almost died.

1:32:18.634 --> 1:32:23.603
Oh baby, that's
not what happened.

1:32:23.605 --> 1:32:26.273
That's not
what happened.

1:32:26.275 --> 1:32:27.874
I don't know
what she told you.

1:32:27.876 --> 1:32:30.977
I don't know what
she told you baby.

1:32:30.979 --> 1:32:33.046
(music plays)

1:32:40.889 --> 1:32:43.723
You're not gonna
hurt us anymore.

1:32:43.725 --> 1:32:46.092
She tried
to kill you.

1:32:46.094 --> 1:32:50.964
She buckled you into a
car, and she pushed you in.

1:32:50.966 --> 1:32:55.402
(music plays)

1:32:55.404 --> 1:32:57.237
She tried
to kill you.

1:32:57.239 --> 1:33:00.340
She pushed you, baby,
I tried to save you.

1:33:00.342 --> 1:33:01.474
She buckled
you into a-

1:33:01.476 --> 1:33:05.245
(shot)

1:33:05.247 --> 1:33:07.314
(music plays)

1:33:13.822 --> 1:33:21.761
(music plays)

1:33:21.763 --> 1:33:23.630
(music plays)

1:33:23.632 --> 1:33:27.133
I told him we
weren't finished yet.

1:33:27.135 --> 1:33:30.203
(music plays)

1:33:30.205 --> 1:33:37.143
(humming)

1:33:37.145 --> 1:33:45.085
(crying)

1:33:45.087 --> 1:33:47.153
(crying)

1:33:53.862 --> 1:33:55.929
(music plays)

1:34:02.337 --> 1:34:04.404
(crying)
