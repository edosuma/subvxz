00:27.694 --> 00:29.404
No, that's not right.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.656
Yah-raaah!

00:29.487 --> 00:31.656
Aaah!

00:31.740 --> 00:35.285
Oh, I had the most horrible
dream that Craig was wasting

00:35.285 --> 00:37.620
our whole afternoon
doing his math homework.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.038
He is.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.790
It was real!

00:40.874 --> 00:43.918
Sorry guys, I-I'm so close
to being done.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.879
I'm on
the last problem.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.840
It's the...
extra credit question.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.136
There are
two train stations

00:53.136 --> 00:54.846
60 miles apart
from one another.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.891
Train A leaves the north station
headed south at 3:00 p.m.,

00:57.891 --> 00:59.434
traveling 60 miles per hour.

00:59.434 --> 01:02.479
Train B leaves the south station
headed North at 4:00 p.m.,

01:02.479 --> 01:03.980
traveling 80 miles per hour.

01:03.980 --> 01:07.192
At what point on the track
will the two trains meet?

01:07.192 --> 01:08.359
Yeah,
I'm out.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.528
Now, hold on.
We can get this.

01:10.612 --> 01:14.032
So...did -- did you say
there was a bus involved?

01:14.032 --> 01:16.117
Can we ask
the driver?

01:17.452 --> 01:18.912
This is impossible.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.206
Sparkle Cadet:
Do I detect negativity?

01:21.206 --> 01:22.540
Huh?

01:22.624 --> 01:26.586
It is I, the champion
of feeling and positivity,

01:26.586 --> 01:30.215
the foe of bad vibes
throughout the galaxy.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.843
I am Sparkle Cadet!

01:33.927 --> 01:37.222
And nobody can dull my sparkle!

01:37.222 --> 01:40.433
Wow, how does she do it
the same every time?

01:40.517 --> 01:42.602
I think she just
reuses the animation.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.021
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,
boop-boop-boop-boop!

01:45.021 --> 01:47.023
The source of the negativity!

01:47.023 --> 01:48.358
Math homework.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.528
Strange, math is one of
your special human powers.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.946
Hmm... Quick!

01:52.946 --> 01:54.697
What's
21 divided by 7?

01:54.781 --> 01:55.990
Uh...
3!

01:56.074 --> 01:58.201
What's 12 million
times 2 divided by 1?

01:58.201 --> 02:00.703
W-Why are you --
24 million!

02:00.787 --> 02:02.956
Oh,
it's just as I feared.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.084
You've been looking at this
problem too long, my friend.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.335
Craig!

02:07.335 --> 02:08.962
Did you ever think
that maybe it's not about

02:08.962 --> 02:10.421
when the trains
will meet

02:10.505 --> 02:13.383
but about who is the type
of person to send these trains

02:13.383 --> 02:15.927
on a collision course
in the first place?

02:18.221 --> 02:20.890
A butterfly
landed on my finger.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.559
Ow, that's a mosquito.
Ow.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.102
Aw, man.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.395
You see, Craig,

02:25.395 --> 02:27.814
sometimes, when you focus
too much on a problem,

02:27.814 --> 02:30.441
your mind can't see
all the solutions.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.443
You need
to take a step back

02:32.527 --> 02:35.029
so you can free
your imagination

02:35.113 --> 02:37.824
and save
the future!

02:37.824 --> 02:40.493
Save the galaxy!

02:40.577 --> 02:44.205
And save the space trains!

02:44.289 --> 02:46.249
Wait, when did they become
space trains?

02:46.249 --> 02:49.961
Kelsey, JP, you stay here
and guard Craig's homework.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.212
Yes!

02:51.296 --> 02:52.755
And I will not move
from this spot,

02:52.839 --> 02:54.924
unless it's to retrieve my sword

02:55.008 --> 02:57.176
from the body
of my enemies.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.012
Ditto!

03:04.559 --> 03:06.728
Hey, Sparkle?

03:06.728 --> 03:08.771
Where are we going?

03:08.855 --> 03:10.899
Y'know,
that's a great question.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.068
Before we adventure any further,
we need to figure out

03:14.152 --> 03:17.071
which one of my nemeses
could be behind this.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.448
There's Galaxy Cadet --

03:18.448 --> 03:20.742
a former ally
slash summer reading buddy

03:20.742 --> 03:22.201
turned agent of chaos

03:22.285 --> 03:25.038
when she plagiarized her
book report from the Internet.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.624
The Dark Moons --
twins from the beta quadrant,

03:27.624 --> 03:30.418
they borrowed my gel pens
and never gave them back!

03:30.418 --> 03:33.379
I don't hold a grudge --
but it's still not okay.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.883
Or it could be...

03:36.883 --> 03:38.676
Colin.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.596
There has to be
some kind of common denominator

03:41.596 --> 03:43.097
that would connect --

03:43.181 --> 03:47.727
The Denominator,
the mastermind of numbers!

03:47.727 --> 03:50.021
Our first encounter
was at space school

03:50.021 --> 03:53.524
in the Gaithersburg System,
where I learned about fractions.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.985
Nearly tore my mind
to pieces.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.987
How are we gonna find
The Denominator?

03:58.071 --> 04:00.156
Open up
your imagination, Craig.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.116
There could be
clues everywhere!

04:02.200 --> 04:04.702
Hey, he's got a number
on his shirt!

04:04.786 --> 04:05.995
Where's The Denominator?!

04:06.079 --> 04:08.039
Tell us!
W-What?

04:08.039 --> 04:09.624
Tell us his plans!

04:09.624 --> 04:11.000
We know you know.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.293
Huh?

04:12.377 --> 04:13.711
Of course!

04:13.795 --> 04:16.047
This zero must mean
he's pretty low on the ranks.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.507
He probably
doesn't know a thing

04:17.507 --> 04:19.801
about the real plans
of The Denominator.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.719
It's a ring.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.719
Wow.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.012
You're right,
Sparkle.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.264
He's completely clueless.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.683
Hey, man!

04:26.683 --> 04:28.726
Hmm, candy.

04:28.810 --> 04:32.230
I think I know where
we can find more information.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.564
All clear
on this side!

04:33.648 --> 04:35.274
No breaches in
the homework zone.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.567
How about you, JP?

04:36.651 --> 04:37.944
JP?

04:37.944 --> 04:39.570
Wha-- JP!

04:39.654 --> 04:41.614
Oh, Kelsey!
Let me explain.

04:41.698 --> 04:42.991
I can't be trusted!

04:42.991 --> 04:45.076
I'm sorry!
Gimme that!

04:45.076 --> 04:47.537
I can't believe you
almost ruined this homework

04:47.537 --> 04:52.667
that Craig worked
so...hard...on.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.544
W-What am I doing?!

04:54.544 --> 04:56.963
JP, we can't be trusted
not to destroy this.

04:56.963 --> 05:01.134
How do we stop our
greatest enemies -- ourselves?

05:01.134 --> 05:03.553
Uh...
Duct tape?

05:03.553 --> 05:06.764
We're here!
The intergalactic hub!

05:06.848 --> 05:09.142
The Trading Tree's
an intergalactic hub?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.727
Of course it is,
silly!

05:10.727 --> 05:14.063
The Trading Tree has the best
snacks in the universe!

05:14.147 --> 05:16.399
Life forms come here
from all over the galaxy.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.151
You haven't noticed
how alien

05:18.151 --> 05:20.236
some of these kids act
around here?

05:20.236 --> 05:22.739
Open up your imagination,
Craig!

05:22.739 --> 05:25.742
T-Rexians from
the Tyranno Galaxy.

05:25.742 --> 05:29.162
A Rollypollian
from the Thorax Colony!

05:29.162 --> 05:31.789
The biodiversity
is endless!

05:31.873 --> 05:33.291
Craig: Do you think he's, like,
from...

05:33.291 --> 05:35.043
a-a frog planet?

05:35.043 --> 05:36.252
Absolutely.

05:36.252 --> 05:39.047
I visited Frogonia once.
Very humid.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.631
My parents told me
it was Orlando,

05:40.715 --> 05:41.883
but I knew
the truth.

05:41.883 --> 05:44.427
Roger:
...97, 98, 99, 100!

05:45.595 --> 05:48.139
I know
that cackle anywhere.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.683
A Denomigoblin!
Oh!

05:50.767 --> 05:53.936
Come on, Craig!
We can't let it get away!

05:54.020 --> 05:55.354
Kelsey:
And done!

05:55.438 --> 05:56.898
Craig's homework
is safe inside.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.775
No bad guys
are gettin' in this baby,

05:58.775 --> 06:02.779
and if they're already in there,
may their suffering be slow.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.406
But, Kelsey,
what if our homework rage

06:05.490 --> 06:08.201
gets the best of us
and <i>we</i> rip it open?

06:08.201 --> 06:09.660
Hmm,
you're right.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.120
Here let me tape you up too.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.371
Great idea.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.082
Then I'll tape you.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.959
Great.
These are both great ideas.

06:22.632 --> 06:23.800
No more running!

06:23.800 --> 06:26.219
Show yourself,
Denomigoblin!

06:26.219 --> 06:27.470
Excuse me!

06:27.470 --> 06:30.598
I am not a goblin
of any kind!

06:30.598 --> 06:32.600
I am a troll.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.227
Then why
were you counting?

06:34.227 --> 06:36.229
Well,
isn't that...

06:36.229 --> 06:38.272
a riddle.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.108
Oh, well, should've saw
this one coming.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.361
What...has many keys
but can open no door?

06:43.361 --> 06:47.448
What...is always in front of you
but can not be seen?

06:47.532 --> 06:48.908
What...
time is it?

06:48.908 --> 06:50.701
Because I have
a dentist appointment,

06:50.785 --> 06:53.079
and my teeth
are jacked up, man!

06:53.079 --> 06:56.499
These psychic brain teasers
are polluting our minds!

06:56.499 --> 06:58.584
He'll never give up
the location!

06:58.668 --> 07:00.586
He already did.
Look!

07:00.670 --> 07:02.338
Titan printing!
Titan!

07:02.338 --> 07:03.881
If that's where
this book is from,

07:03.965 --> 07:06.300
then maybe that's
where The Denominator is.

07:06.384 --> 07:09.262
What?
Titan orbits Saturn.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.847
That's a long ways away.

07:10.847 --> 07:14.142
Not sure how we'll get there
before the dinner tuba.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.853
We just have to
open our imagination.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.856
Aww,
you learn so quickly!

07:19.856 --> 07:23.025
Shooting Sparkle Star!

07:25.111 --> 07:27.321
Whoa!

07:27.405 --> 07:30.324
We're on Titan,
in outer sp--
Watch out!

07:30.408 --> 07:32.535
Aah!

07:32.535 --> 07:35.121
These must be
The Denominator's minions!

07:35.121 --> 07:36.873
You go
and open the entrance

07:36.873 --> 07:38.875
while I deal with
these things.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.877
On it!

07:40.877 --> 07:44.380
Bubble... Blast!

07:46.382 --> 07:48.426
Huh?

07:48.426 --> 07:49.802
A math problem?

07:49.886 --> 07:51.053
No problem.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.850
Take that!

07:55.850 --> 07:57.101
5!

07:57.185 --> 07:58.644
242!

07:58.728 --> 08:00.271
How's it going?

08:00.271 --> 08:02.273
Almost there!
Uh, 60!

08:02.273 --> 08:05.026
Super Sparkle Swing!

08:05.026 --> 08:07.570
One million times zero...
is zero!

08:07.570 --> 08:09.864
I'm in!

08:12.033 --> 08:13.576
Where's The Denominator?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.789
<i>Craig! Sparkle!
We need your help. We, uh --</i>

08:18.873 --> 08:21.417
Oh, my glitter,
they've been taped up!

08:21.417 --> 08:24.420
What awful adversary
adhesived you two?

08:24.420 --> 08:26.088
Was it
The Denominator?

08:26.172 --> 08:28.591
<i>Y-Yep.
Th-That's who did it.</i>

08:28.591 --> 08:32.720
<i>Yeah, we definitely didn't
do this to ourselves.</i>

08:32.720 --> 08:34.555
<i>Whoops!</i>

08:32.803 --> 08:34.555
<i>That's right!</i>

08:34.639 --> 08:36.057
<i>It</i> was <i>me!</i>

08:36.057 --> 08:38.726
<i>And now I'm going to
force your friends</i>

08:38.726 --> 08:43.356
<i>to do math problems
for the rest of their lives!</i>

08:43.356 --> 08:45.107
No!

08:43.439 --> 08:45.107
<i>Yes!</i>

08:45.191 --> 08:48.027
<i>And also, I'm going to mark
the wrong answer</i>

08:48.027 --> 08:50.404
<i>on your
extra-credit question!</i>

08:50.488 --> 08:53.282
Nooooooo!

08:53.366 --> 08:56.452
Sparkle, we have to get back
to save my homework!

08:56.452 --> 08:58.079
And Kelsey
and JP.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.039
Fighting all those
negative numbers

09:00.039 --> 09:02.625
really zapped
my bubble transitions,

09:02.625 --> 09:05.169
but I'll try my best,
Craig.

09:08.756 --> 09:12.426
Hyper Space Bubble!

09:14.804 --> 09:17.557
JP and Kelsey's lives
are in danger

09:17.557 --> 09:19.475
all because of me!

09:19.475 --> 09:21.936
Over one
extra-credit question.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.145
I don't know.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.274
I just hope we make it in...
time.

09:26.274 --> 09:29.986
Traveling at 60 miles per hour,
if Train A leaves at 3:00 p.m.,

09:29.986 --> 09:32.321
it would arrive at
the other station at 4:00 p.m.,

09:32.405 --> 09:34.407
before Train B
even leaves!

09:34.407 --> 09:36.993
The two trains would never meet
on the tracks at all!

09:36.993 --> 09:38.411
It's a trick question!

09:38.411 --> 09:39.704
See, Craig!

09:39.704 --> 09:42.331
I knew
you'd figure it out!

09:44.417 --> 09:47.044
Let them go,
Denominator!

09:47.128 --> 09:49.547
So you've finally made it,
Craigory.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.341
Took you just as long
as I calculated --

09:52.425 --> 09:55.428
so long, I ran out of fingers
to count on!

09:57.430 --> 09:58.848
That wasn't funny.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.516
I'm through with you,
Denominator.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.935
You turned my strengths
against me

10:03.019 --> 10:04.562
and the people
I love.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.272
But I'm not
intimidated by you.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.398
Not anymore.

10:07.398 --> 10:10.026
It's time
to divide and conquer!

10:10.026 --> 10:11.861
Now, Sparks!

10:13.279 --> 10:17.533
Ballistic... Bubble... Burst!

10:17.533 --> 10:22.288
No!

10:22.288 --> 10:24.790
Whoa.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.167
S'cute!

10:26.167 --> 10:28.502
Sparkle, you really
helped me out today.

10:28.586 --> 10:32.173
I was completely stumped
until you opened up my mind.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.341
Thank you.

10:33.341 --> 10:36.385
Don't thank me yet because...

10:36.469 --> 10:38.387
Next time on
"Sparkle Cadet,"

10:38.471 --> 10:41.098
Craig and I team up once again
to finally defeat

10:41.182 --> 10:43.726
the fiendish mastermind
known as... Colin!

10:43.726 --> 10:45.519
Will we overcome
this cosmic evil,

10:45.603 --> 10:47.980
or will his telekinetic powers
of mediocrity

10:48.064 --> 10:49.398
tear our minds
to shreds?

10:49.482 --> 10:50.816
Hold on
to your bubbles

10:50.900 --> 10:53.611
because it's gonna be
a battle for the ages in...

10:56.489 --> 10:58.574
Until then,
stay positive!

10:58.574 --> 11:00.618
Uh, a-are you talking
to us?

11:00.618 --> 11:02.578
Will somebody
untape us?!

11:08.709 --> 11:12.922
♪ I know
I don't have to feel alone ♪

11:12.922 --> 11:16.384
♪ 'Cause I'll see you tomorrow ♪

11:16.384 --> 11:17.635
♪ At the creek ♪

11:17.635 --> 11:19.678
Just like I drew it.
