01:41.893 --> 01:44.646
Oh, did you change your grip?

01:44.729 --> 01:47.899
Clutching firmly with both your hands,

01:48.483 --> 01:49.901
doesn't look so cool.

01:51.361 --> 01:55.907
The aristocrats who created the rule
must be turning in their graves.

01:56.491 --> 02:00.495
I think I'll follow your lead
and change my grip too.

02:00.995 --> 02:04.707
Just like you inadvertently changed yours.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.876
This one won't do.

02:07.377 --> 02:11.297
I think I'd like to change mine like this.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.841
Do you mind?

02:12.924 --> 02:13.800
Wha--

02:18.096 --> 02:19.305
His pinkie?

02:19.889 --> 02:22.183
Is he just totally confident
in his grip strength?

02:22.267 --> 02:23.393
That's brash!

02:23.476 --> 02:25.311
A slight breeze would blow it away!

02:25.895 --> 02:27.313
Or is it strategic?

02:27.897 --> 02:30.650
Do you see, Mr. Guevaru?

02:30.733 --> 02:32.360
Humility.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.445
I'm sure you understand.

02:35.155 --> 02:38.158
The Japanese blood flowing in your body,

02:38.658 --> 02:43.413
seeks humility,
a virtue of the Land of the Rising Sun.

02:43.913 --> 02:48.418
Now, how long will you
continue with that vulgar grip?

02:49.043 --> 02:50.837
Humility…

02:50.920 --> 02:54.340
That's right, restore your pride.

03:44.641 --> 03:48.019
Oh, did you change your grip?

03:51.940 --> 03:55.109
You have it clutched so tight.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.278
Ha!

03:58.071 --> 03:59.530
How unattractive.

04:00.615 --> 04:01.616
So she says.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.044
Your grip,

04:15.088 --> 04:16.798
wasn't it like this?

04:18.341 --> 04:19.217
Hm?

04:32.230 --> 04:33.564
I'm sorry.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.194
I'm sorry, Maria.

04:39.153 --> 04:42.198
I've managed to bore you.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.080
It's alright.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.041
Guevaru.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.712
Say, Guevaru.

04:57.547 --> 05:02.176
How long are you going
to keep gripping that handkerchief?

05:03.386 --> 05:05.221
Grip?

05:06.055 --> 05:07.140
You mean this?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.268
Look at my left hand.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.689
I'm not even pinching it anymore.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.239
I won't even grip it.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.534
I'll just let it lay on my hand.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.788
Is he going to fight like that?

05:33.791 --> 05:35.543
"Gilberto Style" huh?

05:36.878 --> 05:38.504
I've heard of it.

05:40.256 --> 05:43.217
Loser Lose, "Gilberto Style."

05:45.261 --> 05:49.015
Jean Gilberto
was a hotel magnate from Sicily.

05:51.225 --> 05:54.854
He was the first foreigner to build

05:55.438 --> 05:59.359
a giant luxury hotel along
the Champs-Élysées in Paris in 1947

06:00.026 --> 06:04.614
he made headlines
gaining the praise of tourists,

06:04.697 --> 06:06.491
and the disdain of the locals.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.703
The man had another side.

06:11.579 --> 06:15.500
While it was known that he was
also a member of the Mafia,

06:16.626 --> 06:18.711
at the end of 1961,

06:19.253 --> 06:22.423
it was discovered that he was
withholding kickbacks from his bosses

06:22.924 --> 06:27.053
and the organization decided
to execute him immediately.

06:28.346 --> 06:33.017
On January 4th, 1962,
under the full moon at midnight.

06:34.644 --> 06:38.481
surrounded by machine guns
in the Bois de Boulogne,

06:38.564 --> 06:40.400
his execution was carried out.

06:42.610 --> 06:47.573
The style of execution was for both men to
hold a handkerchief and strike each other.

06:48.074 --> 06:51.994
A game of Loser Lose where the one who
let go was immediately shot down.

06:53.788 --> 06:58.543
But this handkerchief match-up
came with a terrifying disadvantage.

07:00.545 --> 07:05.508
In contrast to the huge, young challenger
who held the handkerchief firmly

07:06.717 --> 07:09.220
the weak, 70-year-old Gilberto,

07:09.303 --> 07:11.180
could only let it lay in his palm.

07:12.682 --> 07:16.185
In other words,
the outcome was decided from the start.

07:19.313 --> 07:21.607
Barring a miracle,

07:22.733 --> 07:24.944
the match would be over
with a single punch.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.616
That execution ended with a hail
of bullets from his compatriots,

07:30.700 --> 07:33.619
but Gilberto's name survived
as the title of this rule.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.046
Guevaru lay it on his hand too.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.715
What's going on?

07:54.098 --> 07:56.142
They're punching
with it laying on their hands!

07:56.225 --> 07:57.602
Neither one is backing down!

08:03.316 --> 08:06.110
This… This is why I can't quit.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.614
Oliva's making a move!

08:19.499 --> 08:20.791
Incredible!

08:21.667 --> 08:23.794
He's dead, isn't he?

08:24.378 --> 08:26.380
No, he's not dead!

08:27.381 --> 08:28.799
The back of his hand!

08:28.883 --> 08:31.052
Guevaru kept it on the back of his hand!

08:31.135 --> 08:32.887
What the…

08:34.639 --> 08:36.098
Sheesh.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.559
Aristocrats, the mafia…

08:39.310 --> 08:41.854
Their titles may sound impressive.

08:42.647 --> 08:46.776
But what they're really doing,

08:47.276 --> 08:49.737
is playing a game with handkerchiefs.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.615
What a farce.

08:53.908 --> 08:54.909
It's idiotic.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.577
Hey, Baki!

09:00.122 --> 09:01.082
The wind.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.337
Look at those two.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.591
Are they working together
so it doesn't fly away?

09:11.175 --> 09:13.052
Why go so far?

09:16.430 --> 09:18.349
Are you watching, Maria?

09:18.432 --> 09:20.351
This is a man's fight--

09:25.231 --> 09:27.775
What? Who is this kid?

09:37.952 --> 09:39.078
It flew away.

09:43.457 --> 09:46.377
What the hell are you doing?

09:47.086 --> 09:48.838
Huh? What?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.382
What am I doing, you ask?

09:52.133 --> 09:52.967
What?

09:53.968 --> 09:57.179
The better question is,
"What are you doing?"

09:57.722 --> 10:01.225
A grown man carrying on
over a handkerchief.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.435
"Held it"?

10:02.518 --> 10:03.644
"Gripped it"?

10:03.728 --> 10:04.812
"Pinched it"?

10:04.895 --> 10:05.938
"Placed it"?

10:07.940 --> 10:10.276
The more precarious, the more manly?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.278
How absurd.

10:12.862 --> 10:17.158
It's no wonder this boy fell asleep.

10:19.243 --> 10:23.039
A fight between men should be
a simple knock-down fight.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.999
What else is there?

10:36.260 --> 10:37.720
That was a crazy sound!

10:38.262 --> 10:39.847
That was an all-out hit!

10:40.348 --> 10:42.058
The first in this match.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.062
You're exactly right, Maria.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.942
I was wrong.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.405
A fight between men should be simple.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.076
Where did I go wrong?

11:10.961 --> 11:14.423
I need to question myself once more.

11:18.219 --> 11:23.724
I need you to see me anew!

11:31.357 --> 11:32.983
Whoa, into the wall!

11:33.651 --> 11:35.319
He flew all the way to the wall!

11:36.112 --> 11:38.030
He finished it in one blow!

11:46.414 --> 11:47.998
You've still got it.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.167
You sly old fox.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.753
You're the fox.

11:54.505 --> 11:58.259
Maria, you were so soft and warm.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.052
You smelled so nice!

12:00.636 --> 12:01.512
And,

12:02.471 --> 12:03.305
you're so kind.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.684
You got what you wanted.

12:08.102 --> 12:08.936
Go on.

12:09.812 --> 12:10.938
Thank you very much.

12:15.609 --> 12:16.944
Holy crap!

12:17.027 --> 12:18.529
He's still the king!

12:18.612 --> 12:20.614
Times haven't changed!

12:24.702 --> 12:28.038
Incredible. Truly America's greatest.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.292
Baki, I thank you.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.545
Because of you,

12:35.254 --> 12:39.049
that hard-to-please Maria is calm.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.469
Uh, no problem.

12:42.136 --> 12:46.515
Unchained!

12:48.726 --> 12:50.102
What a happy bunch.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.063
Even though they wanted me to lose.

12:53.647 --> 12:57.568
Unchained!

12:58.611 --> 13:00.070
It doesn't seem like it.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.577
Heave, ho!

13:11.874 --> 13:14.710
On a moonlit night

13:16.670 --> 13:19.673
Heave, ho!

13:21.467 --> 13:24.678
Raise the anchor

13:26.680 --> 13:29.099
Heave, ho!

13:31.936 --> 13:34.605
On a stormy night

13:35.856 --> 13:38.359
Heave, ho!

13:39.443 --> 13:42.112
Hoist the sail

13:43.948 --> 13:46.867
Heave, ho!

13:48.702 --> 13:52.122
With the stars as the guide

13:53.457 --> 13:56.168
Heave, ho!

13:57.962 --> 14:01.465
Set course for treasure

14:06.470 --> 14:08.889
Heave, ho!

14:09.723 --> 14:13.477
Put the rum aside

14:13.978 --> 14:16.730
Heave, ho!

14:18.107 --> 14:20.818
Burn the iron

14:25.614 --> 14:26.907
What the…

14:33.122 --> 14:34.331
Guevaru's chest…

14:35.165 --> 14:36.625
It's the hit from earlier.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.794
The imprint is so clear.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.922
Heave, ho!

14:43.757 --> 14:48.178
Throw modesty to the wind

14:49.513 --> 14:53.726
Reject forbearance

14:54.518 --> 14:59.565
Don't give in to satisfaction

15:03.569 --> 15:04.695
It starts now.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.532
Guevaru is just getting started!

15:10.451 --> 15:15.080
Say it's not enough

15:20.669 --> 15:22.630
It seems you're not giving chase.

15:23.213 --> 15:24.798
Did you get scared?

15:36.143 --> 15:37.353
It isn't over.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.688
Guevaru is raring to go!

15:39.772 --> 15:41.357
Second's gonna do it!

15:41.440 --> 15:42.858
Guevaru!

15:42.942 --> 15:47.363
Guevaru!

15:50.866 --> 15:52.868
It is what it is.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.704
Guevaru!

16:06.632 --> 16:09.009
I underestimated you.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.887
I was being too caring,

16:11.971 --> 16:15.391
and considerate.

16:16.016 --> 16:19.269
I thought you were
too small to beat seriously.

16:20.854 --> 16:21.981
He's not bluffing.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.900
That's how Oliva really feels.

16:26.443 --> 16:27.778
Ah.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.907
It's just what we need.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.826
The wind.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.671
What a good day.

16:47.589 --> 16:48.465
Yeah.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.927
It's a good day to die!

16:53.554 --> 16:54.430
Guevaru.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.517
You have a blind spot.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.690
How long has it been?

17:06.984 --> 17:09.653
Since I seriously hit someone.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.701
It was happening on a global scale.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.873
Small incidents were occurring.

17:21.874 --> 17:22.708
Huh?

17:23.417 --> 17:24.293
In the sea.

17:25.044 --> 17:25.961
It's the ocean.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.506
In the mountain.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.467
I'm driving in the forest?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.218
Oh, my.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.261
TENDAN DEPARTMENT STORE

17:34.344 --> 17:35.220
In the city.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.473
It says we're driving through a building.

17:38.098 --> 17:38.974
And…

17:41.143 --> 17:42.603
The navigation is askew.

17:43.353 --> 17:45.230
Something must have happened.

17:47.941 --> 17:52.154
Your control of the car
is like your control over this country.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.865
Sloppy.

17:55.699 --> 17:56.658
Sorry.

17:57.159 --> 18:02.623
But, certainly for me, this is
the safest car in the world right now.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.769
I'm the only one left out, huh?

18:27.231 --> 18:28.774
It's suffocating.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.821
The security cars
that surround us front and back.

18:34.988 --> 18:38.450
Plain-clothed detectives
stationed every 100 meters.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.913
Turning down these alleyways
isn't even allowed.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.165
How absurd.

18:46.291 --> 18:51.380
So this is what driving is like
for George Bosch, the President of the US,

18:51.463 --> 18:53.674
the land of the free?

18:54.508 --> 18:57.136
As brutal as always.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.684
Is that it?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.527
Chamomile Lessen.

19:14.069 --> 19:17.823
Of course,
I'm on your personal security detail, and…

19:18.615 --> 19:22.286
citizen of the little island in question.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.580
I'm one of J. Guevaru's men.

19:25.789 --> 19:28.458
We are on equal footing with the US.

19:29.710 --> 19:33.964
As long as you do not violate our rights,
I will protect your safety.

19:42.764 --> 19:43.724
Lessen.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.727
We've run into a problem.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.354
Do you mean for you?

19:50.272 --> 19:51.690
Or for me?

19:53.066 --> 19:54.735
Which do you think?

19:55.903 --> 19:59.823
I said before that I would protect you.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.492
Are you testing that now?

20:03.118 --> 20:05.996
Lessen, you see,

20:06.622 --> 20:10.500
Mr. Hanma here says
he's going to attack me now.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.419
Won't you save me?

20:13.003 --> 20:14.254
Bosch!

20:16.924 --> 20:17.758
You bastard.

20:18.634 --> 20:22.763
Your last request of me as a president,

20:23.263 --> 20:25.849
had better not be this.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.769
No, uh…

20:31.980 --> 20:34.691
Then this is no game.

20:34.775 --> 20:35.609
What?

20:35.692 --> 20:36.735
Mr. Bosch.

20:37.861 --> 20:40.530
What you're trying to do is suicide.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.201
Protecting someone attempting suicide,

20:44.952 --> 20:47.788
is outside the purview of my duties.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.540
Furthermore,

20:51.124 --> 20:55.504
it is impossible for me
to protect you from his attack

20:56.129 --> 21:00.842
He will crush whatever I might attempt.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.804
This man is capable of that.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.514
Please forgive me.

21:11.687 --> 21:12.521
This…

21:18.110 --> 21:19.945
This is the only way.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.833
Nicely done, kid.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.255
Just as you predicted,

21:38.338 --> 21:40.465
you couldn't protect Bosch from me,

21:41.133 --> 21:43.010
but I can't fault your actions.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.471
It's proof you were well-trained.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.558
I'm not interested in you,

21:50.851 --> 21:53.312
but I want a piece of your master.

22:08.827 --> 22:11.747
Heave, ho

22:13.582 --> 22:15.417
It's time to set sail…

23:47.426 --> 23:51.221
