01:40.800 --> 01:45.146
I was just thinking about those meetings
you were telling me about.

01:49.576 --> 01:52.352
I remember telling my friend
in the fourth grade...

01:52.512 --> 01:54.219
...that my parents weren't in love.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.053
How did you come to that conclusion?

01:56.216 --> 01:59.288
I don't know. I just-- I felt it.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.590
They never fought.

02:00.753 --> 02:03.324
They just didn't talk, really.

02:03.490 --> 02:06.198
Dad went to work. Mom did Mom stuff.

02:06.359 --> 02:08.066
Dad watched wrestling on TV.

02:08.228 --> 02:11.334
Mom would get the neighbor
on the phone and talk for hours.

02:11.931 --> 02:13.740
They just didn't talk to each other.

02:13.900 --> 02:14.901
Yeah.

02:15.068 --> 02:18.675
I don't remember my parents
talking to each other much, either.

02:20.206 --> 02:23.016
I remember,
we would get home from school...

02:23.176 --> 02:24.951
...and my mom would be laying
on the couch...

02:25.111 --> 02:29.025
...asleep with a newspaper
over her face.

02:29.616 --> 02:32.426
And she would get up
and fix us dinner...

02:32.585 --> 02:34.496
...and we were too scared to tell her...

02:34.654 --> 02:39.194
...that there would be newspaper
ink all over her face.

02:41.794 --> 02:46.766
Then after dinner,
she would lay back down on the couch...

02:46.933 --> 02:49.413
...and put the paper back on her face.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.943
- Sounds like she was exhausted.
- Yeah.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.884
I was scared of my mom.

02:57.343 --> 03:01.348
- And now I've turned into her.
- I can relate to that.

03:02.081 --> 03:04.152
Sometimes I scream at the kids...

03:04.317 --> 03:05.887
...like she used to, to us.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.633
I try and figure out,
"Why am I doing that?"

03:10.023 --> 03:11.969
But then I look at them...

03:12.125 --> 03:14.036
...and I think...

03:14.827 --> 03:16.966
...I didn't choose you.

03:19.265 --> 03:20.573
I love you...

03:20.733 --> 03:23.111
...but I didn't choose you.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.828
When he looks at me,
all sees is a chicken-fried steak...

03:37.984 --> 03:40.294
...and a wet hole to squirt himself into.

03:40.653 --> 03:42.223
Do I know the feeling.

03:42.388 --> 03:46.268
I am so glad that you decided to come.

03:46.426 --> 03:47.769
What do you--?

03:47.927 --> 03:49.167
What do you think?

03:49.729 --> 03:51.606
It's interesting.

03:51.764 --> 03:54.244
Do you--? Do you think that
you'll come back?

03:54.400 --> 03:57.142
If I get to write this article,
I'll need to come back.

03:57.303 --> 03:59.374
Interview some of these ladies.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.613
And you really...

04:01.774 --> 04:05.449
...think that Gregory is gonna give you
a chance to write an article?

04:06.312 --> 04:08.588
I think he's considering it.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.758
Well...

04:11.217 --> 04:12.890
...that's great for you.

04:33.239 --> 04:34.684
Hey.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.116
Would you mind if I
bummed a smoke?

04:37.277 --> 04:38.381
All right, sure.

04:38.544 --> 04:39.955
Here you go.

04:50.189 --> 04:52.567
Somebody help me!

05:57.724 --> 05:59.431
I thought it was an earthquake.

05:59.592 --> 06:01.230
I could see the smoke from Midtown.

06:01.394 --> 06:02.668
My windows were shaking.

06:08.601 --> 06:10.911
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, good morning.

06:15.341 --> 06:17.446
- Wasn't a gas leak?
- That's what they thought.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.921
But then cops found dynamite
and fragments from a homemade bomb.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.959
- So not a gas leak.
- Terrorists. That's the thinking.

06:24.117 --> 06:27.291
- But no one can figure out a target.
- How many dead?

06:27.453 --> 06:28.659
At least two.

06:28.821 --> 06:29.993
But...

06:30.490 --> 06:33.699
- But?
- Um, but they're still collecting body parts.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.771
And nobody knows
how many were in there.

06:35.928 --> 06:38.602
- But at least two are dead.
- They found three hands.

06:38.765 --> 06:41.803
Dustin Hoffman lives next door.
Shares a wall with the house.

06:42.668 --> 06:45.547
A bomb seems advanced
for a crazed fan.

06:45.705 --> 06:47.514
Or somebody who
didn't like The Graduate.

06:47.673 --> 06:50.483
- Who didn't like The Graduate?
- I didn't like The Graduate.

06:52.678 --> 06:54.214
Oh, really?

06:54.380 --> 06:55.518
What didn't you like?

06:55.681 --> 06:57.251
I thought it was pretentious.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.728
A male fantasy masked as
a symbol of student revolt.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.594
I didn't buy it.

07:03.556 --> 07:04.591
Fair enough.

07:06.292 --> 07:09.330
See what you can get confirmed.
Find out who owned the building.

07:09.495 --> 07:11.702
Someone with money.
Nicest block in the Village.

07:11.864 --> 07:13.810
Find who lived there,
who wanted who dead.

07:13.966 --> 07:16.378
- Headed there now.
- Rhodes.

07:16.836 --> 07:21.182
Put your tie on. You represent me
out there, and I'm a dapper son of a bitch.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.445

07:32.418 --> 07:33.658

We're immortal now, you and me.

07:43.229 --> 07:45.072
I'm proud of you, man.

07:49.435 --> 07:52.609
Hey, Noah,
your smile could be a touch smilier.

07:52.772 --> 07:54.877
Is that a smile or a grimace?

07:55.041 --> 07:56.042
My smile.

07:56.209 --> 07:59.486
Worry about yourself, Sam.
You look like you're trying to pinch a loaf.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.216
All right, just snap your little pictures.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.922
Jane, why don't you scoot up here?

08:05.084 --> 08:07.894
Maybe a pretty blonde
will get him to smile.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.562
Sure.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.681
Perfect.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.581
I might have to give you
a shared photo credit on this one.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.408
Um...

08:53.733 --> 08:55.610
Angie...

08:55.801 --> 08:56.905
...are you okay?

08:57.169 --> 08:58.807
I'm fine. Thank you.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.455
Oh! Damn it, I'm locked in here.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.154
Unh!

09:13.019 --> 09:16.125
Why don't you-- Why don't you
lay down on the couch?

09:16.289 --> 09:19.327
And I'll-- I'll get you a towel
for your forehead.

09:20.793 --> 09:23.296
I'm afraid if I lie down,
I'll get nauseous again.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.271
Do you have a fever?

09:30.236 --> 09:32.443
Angie, are you drinking tansy oil?

09:33.973 --> 09:35.680
How can you tell?

09:37.076 --> 09:38.680
Your pupils.

09:43.649 --> 09:46.789
I can't be away from
Finn and Gregory's phones this long.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.495
Angie.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.038
How much have you had?

10:02.668 --> 10:04.545
I started last night.

10:05.204 --> 10:07.707
I was told to put it in tea...

10:07.873 --> 10:09.477
...and drink it every three hours.

10:09.642 --> 10:11.349
How far along are you?

10:11.510 --> 10:13.581
I'm two weeks late.

10:13.746 --> 10:15.089
But I know I'm pregnant.

10:15.247 --> 10:19.286
- Two weeks? That could just be--
- I've got three kids.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.022
I know.

10:21.387 --> 10:25.199
I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry.
I thought that Vera was...

10:25.358 --> 10:27.599
...your only child.

10:36.335 --> 10:38.781
I can't have a fourth one.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.181
I just can't.

10:42.508 --> 10:44.715
We are so strapped.

10:46.612 --> 10:48.523
It's my fault.

10:48.681 --> 10:52.026
At Frank's birthday,
I had too many gin and tonics.

10:52.451 --> 10:53.930
Does he know?

10:57.790 --> 11:02.967
The-- The tansy tea
doesn't always work.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.733
And it can damage the baby.

11:04.897 --> 11:07.036
I don't have a lot of options.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.454
Office of Phinneaus Woodhouse.
This is Angie.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.249
Uh-huh.

11:22.581 --> 11:24.322
Of course.

11:33.392 --> 11:34.837
Jane.

11:40.433 --> 11:43.903
A couple hundred words should be fine.
Attagirl, Jane.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.778
The local angle is what I
wanna play more.

11:55.815 --> 11:56.816
Hello.

11:56.982 --> 11:58.586
So, Jane...

11:58.884 --> 12:00.363
...what do you think?

12:02.188 --> 12:03.895
Yes?

12:04.690 --> 12:05.691
Or yes?

12:08.160 --> 12:09.639
- I think...
- Ah...

12:11.097 --> 12:13.202
Yes? Hm?

12:14.533 --> 12:16.012
Or yes?

12:16.635 --> 12:17.807
The first ones.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.815
- These?
- Mm-hm.

12:21.173 --> 12:22.618
Really?

12:23.008 --> 12:25.648
Guess these are
a little too Elvis on stage, huh?

12:26.512 --> 12:27.718
I've got a girl at Saks...

12:27.947 --> 12:29.722
...lets me test drive the trends.

12:30.983 --> 12:32.553
Jane, sit down, please.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.902
You're a big brain in a pretty
little package, aren't you?

12:47.166 --> 12:49.578
I talked to Finn about your idea...

12:49.735 --> 12:51.772
...about an article on the bra burners.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.679
- Oh, well, it wouldn't exactly be just--
- I know, I know.

12:55.074 --> 12:57.680
The whole thing, the women's march...

12:57.843 --> 13:00.414
...wives refusing to cook dinner
for their husbands.

13:00.579 --> 13:03.719
Gloria Steinem, Phyllis Schlafly,
my mother.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.487
Who's your mother?

13:05.651 --> 13:07.995
Heh, heh. I'm kidding.

13:08.187 --> 13:09.495
Ah...

13:09.722 --> 13:11.395
Anyway, it's great.

13:12.658 --> 13:13.728
Really?

13:14.160 --> 13:15.230
We love it.

13:15.394 --> 13:17.772
It's relevant.
Time isn't covering it.

13:17.930 --> 13:20.968
You know, Newsweek did
a cover story called "Women in Revolt."

13:21.133 --> 13:22.373
Did big numbers for them.

13:23.102 --> 13:25.912
Over 50 percent of our readers
are women. Did you know that?

13:26.071 --> 13:27.948
I did. I did know that.

13:28.107 --> 13:29.245
So the question is...

13:29.875 --> 13:31.855
...who are we gonna get
to write the thing?

13:32.011 --> 13:33.081
We think you're right.

13:33.512 --> 13:37.961
A man's byline, it just makes
the whole story feel disingenuous.

13:38.117 --> 13:39.152
So...

13:39.318 --> 13:41.195
...Finn reached out to Ruth Penney.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.602
- She writes for BusinessWeek.
- Freelancer.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.238
<i>BusinessWeek, Good Housekeeping.</i>

13:49.862 --> 13:51.739
Oh, okay.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.210
Well, I'm glad it's getting written.

13:54.366 --> 13:56.243
Thanks to you.

13:56.402 --> 14:00.145
Now, I told her that if she needs
any help with research, I've got the girl.

14:00.306 --> 14:01.614
This is her number.

14:01.774 --> 14:05.722
I want you to call her, introduce yourself,
see if you can help.

14:07.279 --> 14:08.883
Thank you.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.630
Keep those juices flowing, Jane.

14:13.786 --> 14:16.892
Any time that you have an idea
that you wanna share...

14:17.056 --> 14:19.002
...you come see me. Hm?

14:20.159 --> 14:22.161
You're very special.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.618
Use your own trash can, please.

14:58.597 --> 15:01.043
What's the square footage?

15:01.700 --> 15:04.510
Wow, that must be nice.

15:04.670 --> 15:09.415
And how many units in the building
can Mr. Wilkerson rent out?

15:11.810 --> 15:14.120
Oh, okay, thank you so much.

15:20.452 --> 15:24.366
Well, of course a woman from outside
the magazine has more experience.

15:24.523 --> 15:28.335
How are we supposed to get experience
from inside this magazine?

15:28.494 --> 15:32.135
I cannot believe you pitched an article
about the women's movement.

15:32.298 --> 15:35.745
- I told you I was writing that article.
- I know. I just thought--

15:35.901 --> 15:39.405
You thought you'd undercut me and
steal my article. That's what you thought.

15:39.571 --> 15:43.451
No, it wasn't like that.
I was with Gregory...

15:43.776 --> 15:45.312
...and it just happened.

15:46.078 --> 15:47.318
It just happened?

15:47.479 --> 15:50.358
Okay, I-- I don't know
what's going on here...

15:50.516 --> 15:54.430
...but, Patti, what if a female writer
on a cover piece...

15:54.586 --> 15:56.827
...hurts our EEOC complaint?

15:56.989 --> 16:00.027
I mean, even if she's not from inside?

16:00.392 --> 16:02.838
I don't know.
We'll have to ask Eleanor that.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.065
Who's that?

16:04.229 --> 16:05.606
She's our lawyer.

16:06.231 --> 16:07.403
I'll ask her.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.341
Are you saying...?

16:10.502 --> 16:12.004
I'm in.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.472
Jane.

16:14.206 --> 16:15.583
That's great.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.277
It is great.

16:17.609 --> 16:18.679
Oh, God.

16:21.246 --> 16:22.623
Oh, it's just you.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.053
Girls, Jane is in.

16:26.385 --> 16:27.625
We're out.

16:27.886 --> 16:28.956
- What?
- No, you're not.

16:29.121 --> 16:31.692
- Why are you out?
- Naomi was talking to Eleanor--

16:31.857 --> 16:33.700
Why was Naomi talking to Eleanor?

16:33.859 --> 16:36.567
She needed legal advice
about something else.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.606
Then they talked about the complaint.

16:39.131 --> 16:41.543
Eleanor said now that we've
reached critical mass...

16:41.800 --> 16:44.280
...she's going to start planning
the press conference.

16:44.436 --> 16:46.211
She never mentioned
a press conference.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.318
- Why a press conference?
- Exactly.

16:48.474 --> 16:50.681
She wants to turn us
into a public spectacle.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.551
Our picture would be taken,
our names will be in the paper.

16:53.712 --> 16:55.487
We didn't know
this would be so public.

16:55.647 --> 16:58.059
We're supposed to cover the news,
not make the news.

16:58.217 --> 16:59.321
So Naomi is out too?

16:59.485 --> 17:01.590
- And Diane.
- Oh...

17:01.754 --> 17:04.530
Look, maybe if another magazine
ends up suing and winning...

17:04.690 --> 17:06.863
...then things will change for us too.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.436
We won't have to risk as much.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.468
Anyway, busy day.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.906
- What firm is your lawyer with?
- The ACLU.

17:17.069 --> 17:21.108
- How much do you know about her?
- Well, she's wonderful, normally.

17:21.272 --> 17:24.049
L-- I would consider her a friend. Um...

17:24.209 --> 17:26.119
God, she's-- She's pregnant.

17:26.412 --> 17:28.892
- She's black.
- Met at a consciousness raising meeting.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.585
- Yes.
- How long has she been practicing law?

17:33.385 --> 17:35.661
Where did she get her degree?

17:37.589 --> 17:39.330
How many cases has she tried?

17:44.830 --> 17:46.810
Just a list of the most recent bombings.

17:46.965 --> 17:48.808
- Just in New York or?
- Just in New York.

17:50.135 --> 17:52.342
I thought of you.
Don't you live in the Village?

17:53.505 --> 17:54.506
I do.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.544
Yeah, I do live in the Village.

17:57.709 --> 17:58.847
Felt like...

17:59.011 --> 18:02.891
...a gun going off in my apartment,
but it was about eight blocks away.

18:03.782 --> 18:06.729
I actually thought of you too.

18:08.787 --> 18:13.202
I remember you saying
you were a chocolate person.

18:14.493 --> 18:17.804
Or that you like chocolates.

18:20.265 --> 18:23.337
Thank you.
That's-- That's so very nice.

18:24.169 --> 18:26.308
I'll get on this.

18:36.682 --> 18:39.060
I mean, he keeps
wanting me to make calls.

18:39.218 --> 18:41.391
If he can't handle
a friendly dinner party...

18:41.553 --> 18:43.658
...then what job can I
recommend him for?

18:43.822 --> 18:45.927
Well, don't give up. He's a friend.

18:46.225 --> 18:47.397
He's a source.

18:49.495 --> 18:50.997
Okay, let's get going.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.109
See if that pouch from D.C. has arrived.

18:53.265 --> 18:55.370
Mike sent me
some freeze-dried ice cream...

18:55.534 --> 18:58.981
...from the Air and Space Museum.
New flavor: Mint chocolate chip.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.278
- Want to try some?
- No, thanks. I'll see you later?

19:02.908 --> 19:04.319
Sure.

19:15.554 --> 19:16.555
Hi.

19:19.024 --> 19:20.196
Hi.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.773
I was hoping we could talk about
your conversation...

19:24.930 --> 19:26.967
...about a certain press conference.

19:27.699 --> 19:29.770
So you're a part of it now?

19:29.935 --> 19:33.212
I was hoping to be, but I heard
a lot of girls are dropping out...

19:33.372 --> 19:34.749
...like you.

19:34.907 --> 19:37.285
And I wanted to hear your side.

19:37.442 --> 19:40.150
- Look, I have bigger things going on.
- Like what?

19:40.312 --> 19:43.987
- Like personal life things.
- Like what?

19:44.149 --> 19:46.186
Is your son okay?

19:47.052 --> 19:48.429
Is your husband okay?

19:50.722 --> 19:52.668
I'm about to lose our apartment...

19:52.824 --> 19:55.964
...and the bank won't let me refinance
without Brian's signature.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.835
Obviously, they know he's overseas.

19:57.996 --> 20:00.237
Still need an authorization form.

20:00.399 --> 20:01.901
And I keep sending it...

20:02.067 --> 20:06.140
...but the truck carrying the mail
to the base got blown up twice.

20:07.072 --> 20:10.747
They can't keep you out of your home
because you can't get something signed.

20:10.909 --> 20:13.515
They definitely can.

20:13.679 --> 20:16.023
Well, let's do something about it, then.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.322
Why?

20:20.352 --> 20:22.593
Because that's not right.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.676
Hi, Ned.

20:34.199 --> 20:36.475
Hey, how's it going?

20:37.169 --> 20:40.173
Um, I just brought you these captions.

20:40.339 --> 20:42.842
Great, thanks.

20:50.849 --> 20:52.795
Look at this Qaddafi guy.

20:52.951 --> 20:54.191
What a bozo.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.562
It's like he saw the movie Bullitt,
and said to himself:

20:57.723 --> 21:00.670
"I'm gonna be the Steve McQueen
of Northern Africa."

21:04.930 --> 21:06.170
Um...

21:08.567 --> 21:10.808
Alex's girl left.

21:11.637 --> 21:15.312
So I volunteered to be his researcher.

21:19.244 --> 21:21.417
That's probably for the best.

21:26.351 --> 21:27.887
Uh...

21:28.854 --> 21:30.492
Kathy...

21:30.656 --> 21:34.103
...has offered to take over captions.

21:34.259 --> 21:36.034
If that's okay with you.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.565
<i>Yeah , Kathy“ be fine.</i>

21:37.729 --> 21:40.266
I think-- I think she'll be good.

21:44.536 --> 21:46.379
Well, um...

21:47.873 --> 21:49.546
...goodbye.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.589
Bye.

21:59.184 --> 22:02.290
I'll probably see you
at the vending machines in a little while.

22:05.657 --> 22:09.469
Hello, reporting for duty,
if you'll have me.

22:35.053 --> 22:36.054
Joe.

22:36.421 --> 22:37.661
Joe, I've got 3..

22:37.823 --> 22:39.325
Hello?

22:40.125 --> 22:41.661
Yeah, I'm still here.

22:41.827 --> 22:43.101
Are you-J)

22:43.261 --> 22:46.731
Look, I've got a favor to ask.
We need you to--

22:47.032 --> 22:50.275
Heh. Don't worry, I'll check. Ha, ha, ha.

22:50.569 --> 22:53.709
That's how you always got yourself
into trouble, my friend.

22:54.106 --> 22:55.585
Look, here's the situation.

22:55.741 --> 22:57.448
We need you to type up a-- A...

22:57.609 --> 23:00.988
- Financial letter of authorization.
- Financial letter of authorization.

23:01.146 --> 23:04.355
And get it signed by
one of our boys in the field.

23:04.649 --> 23:06.925
- He's with the--
-1 st Infantry Division.

23:07.085 --> 23:10.430
1st Infantry Division. Brian Barclay.

23:10.622 --> 23:11.999
What's that?

23:12.357 --> 23:14.064
- The Big Red One?
- Yeah, that's him.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.796
Yes, that's it.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.301
Jane's here.
She's gonna give you the details.

23:18.830 --> 23:21.140
Hollander, yes. You remember her?

23:22.434 --> 23:23.742
Yup.

23:23.902 --> 23:24.937
Yes.

23:25.103 --> 23:27.413
She still is, yup.

23:27.672 --> 23:29.481
Sorry, bud. We're on a deadline here.

23:29.641 --> 23:32.850
I'm putting Jane
on the phone right now.

23:34.045 --> 23:35.388
Oh, hi there, Joe.

23:36.615 --> 23:38.652
Oh, you too.

23:39.684 --> 23:42.221
That's so sweet.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.493
Okay, listen, I'm going to dictate to you.
Are you ready?

23:46.558 --> 23:49.232
Mr. Henry J. Livingston.

23:49.528 --> 23:51.769
I've had my studio here for,
oh, I don't know...

23:51.930 --> 23:54.843
...five or six years and nothing like this
has ever happened.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.207
So yeah,
I ran out to see what was going on.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.315
You say you saw two girls,
one was naked?

23:59.471 --> 24:02.145
She had a towel around her
and a shower cap on.

24:02.307 --> 24:04.651
- The other girl?
- In a nightgown, very ratty.

24:04.810 --> 24:07.290
- Must've been sleeping. Yeah.
- You speak to them?

24:07.446 --> 24:11.155
I told them they can't run down
the street like that, even if it is the Village.

24:11.316 --> 24:13.592
Had you seen them before?
How old were they?

24:13.752 --> 24:15.663
- Can you describe them for me?
- Twenties.

24:15.821 --> 24:19.496
The one in the nightshirt was shorter.
Brown hair, great face, exotic looking.

24:19.658 --> 24:21.365
Very Lupe Velez, you know?

24:22.027 --> 24:23.904
Lupe Velez.

24:24.062 --> 24:26.372
You don't know who that is, do you?

24:26.531 --> 24:28.738
On a scale of one to 10,
how important is it?

24:28.900 --> 24:30.004
Oh, you kids.

24:30.168 --> 24:31.841
Just write "high cheekbones."

24:35.740 --> 24:37.413
Whoa, Robinson, tap the brakes.

24:38.009 --> 24:40.489
- Hi.
- What do we know?

24:41.246 --> 24:44.625
The owner of the building
is paying utility bills on the apartment...

24:44.783 --> 24:48.230
...and the phone is in his name,
but he doesn't live there.

24:48.386 --> 24:49.865
Maybe it's the super?

24:50.021 --> 24:51.557
<i>Or a pied 'a tetra?</i>

24:54.025 --> 24:56.562
It's not the super.
The super lives around the corner.

24:57.295 --> 24:58.296
Excuse me.

24:58.463 --> 25:00.136
What do you have?

25:03.869 --> 25:06.975
A great white shark attacked a family
on the beach in Queensland.

25:07.138 --> 25:09.277
I love Australia. Hate the sharks.

25:09.441 --> 25:10.545
You ever been?

25:11.776 --> 25:13.551
I don't even have a passport.

25:14.813 --> 25:16.087
Ah.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.689
You must get a passport.

25:19.284 --> 25:20.456
Immediately.

25:30.295 --> 25:32.138
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

25:40.438 --> 25:42.418
- Patti Robinson.
- It's me.

25:42.574 --> 25:46.579
Police are looking for two women who
were seen running out of the building.

25:46.745 --> 25:49.123
Brown hair? Brown eyes? Mid 20s?

25:49.281 --> 25:51.625
High cheekbones, like Lupe Velez.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.385
Like who?

25:53.885 --> 25:56.058
Oh, good.
You're as ignorant as I am.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.325
Do we know who she is?

25:57.489 --> 25:59.935
<i>My guess, Cathlyn Plat': Wilkerson.</i>

26:00.091 --> 26:02.503
Her father, James Wilkerson,
owns the building.

26:02.661 --> 26:05.267
<i>She's been arrested four times
for protests.</i>

26:05.430 --> 26:08.036
She was SDS at Swarthmore,
that wasn't radical enough.

26:08.199 --> 26:11.271
So she and some friends joined
a group to overthrow the government.

26:11.436 --> 26:13.575
<i>Wait, she blew up her dad's building?</i>

26:13.738 --> 26:15.376
Maybe not on purpose.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.019
Ah.

26:17.542 --> 26:18.816
Bomb-making accident.

26:18.977 --> 26:20.115
Good work, partner.

26:20.278 --> 26:22.087
Likewise, partner.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.318
See if you can find out
who Cathy lived with.

26:24.482 --> 26:26.155
I bet the roommate's the other girl.

26:26.351 --> 26:27.830
On it.

26:33.124 --> 26:34.762
Cindy.

26:38.630 --> 26:40.473
I wanna talk to you about your friend.

26:41.399 --> 26:45.905
The last press conference she held
was when she represented the KKK.

26:49.174 --> 26:50.676
I did not know that.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.412
The KKK?

26:53.578 --> 26:55.819
Is she our lawyer,
or is she a carnival barker?

26:55.981 --> 26:59.895
It is definitely one of the questions
on our list.

27:00.051 --> 27:01.394
We're gonna go see her.

27:01.553 --> 27:02.759
Can you come with us?

27:02.921 --> 27:04.696
Doug really needs me on this story.

27:06.191 --> 27:07.499
It's a bombing...

27:07.659 --> 27:10.868
...and it's a couple subway stops
from here. I mean...

27:11.963 --> 27:14.034
Cindy, can't we go later in the week?

27:14.199 --> 27:18.238
I think if we're doing this, we should try
to move it forward as quickly as possible.

27:18.837 --> 27:21.841
Before we lose more girls. Especially if
we have to hire a new lawyer.

27:22.007 --> 27:23.486
She's right.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.280
I'll, um--

27:25.644 --> 27:26.748
I'll get my coat.

27:31.016 --> 27:32.290
Patti...

27:32.450 --> 27:33.929
...I want you to know...

27:34.085 --> 27:36.361
...I wasn't trying to steal your story.

27:36.521 --> 27:39.502
Did the idea of pitching a story
about feminism...

27:39.658 --> 27:42.366
...even occur to you
before you heard about our complaint?

27:42.527 --> 27:45.736
There are millions of stories to tell
about the women's movement.

27:46.965 --> 27:50.435
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter now.

27:50.602 --> 27:54.812
Neither one of us is gonna be
writing the story for News of the <i>Week.</i>

27:58.443 --> 28:01.322
My job is defending
the First Amendment.

28:01.479 --> 28:04.119
So if the KKK
gets to speak their mind...

28:04.282 --> 28:05.556
...everybody does.

28:06.418 --> 28:07.897
Well...

28:08.053 --> 28:09.123
...I guess you don't...

28:10.121 --> 28:12.897
...have to be friends...

28:13.058 --> 28:14.469
...with all of your clients.

28:14.626 --> 28:17.573
What I do has nothing to do
with friendship, Cindy.

28:19.731 --> 28:21.938
We aren't comfortable
with the press conference.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.235
Excuse me?

28:24.869 --> 28:25.870
We agreed to file...

28:26.037 --> 28:29.143
...but going out in front of news cameras
isn't working for us.

28:30.075 --> 28:31.383
Hm.

28:32.777 --> 28:34.313
All right.

28:34.979 --> 28:35.980
No press conference.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.291
- Thank you.
- Sure.

28:40.452 --> 28:41.556
In fact...

28:41.720 --> 28:44.633
...let's not file the complaint at all.

28:44.923 --> 28:48.769
Let's just tell our closest friends
about something we almost did once.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.375
We aren't the ones
changing the terms here.

28:52.530 --> 28:54.271
This was supposed to be a filing.

29:02.173 --> 29:04.050
Do you know the name
Claudette Colvin?

29:07.812 --> 29:09.814
In March of '55...

29:09.981 --> 29:14.828
...a white girl boarded a city bus
in Montgomery, Alabama.

29:14.986 --> 29:17.296
The bus driver
ordered a Negro woman...

29:17.622 --> 29:21.160
...Claudette Colvin,
to give up her seat to the white girl.

29:21.326 --> 29:22.930
Claudette said no...

29:23.094 --> 29:25.267
...on account of
her Constitutional rights.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.967
Before she knew it,
she was dragged from that bus...

29:28.133 --> 29:30.204
...by force by the Montgomery police.

29:30.368 --> 29:34.145
That was nine months
before Rosa Parks did the same thing.

29:34.305 --> 29:37.775
So why doesn't anybody
talk about her?

29:37.942 --> 29:40.855
Because to some,
Claudette was too young...

29:41.012 --> 29:43.993
...too outspoken,
and frankly, too dark-skinned...

29:44.149 --> 29:46.220
...to be the poster child
of a movement...

29:46.384 --> 29:47.886
...at that point in our history.

29:48.052 --> 29:51.625
If the NAACP was going to
put forward a test case...

29:51.790 --> 29:55.738
...they needed someone
who was well-spoken but respectful.

29:55.894 --> 29:58.704
They needed someone middle class,
not poor.

30:00.098 --> 30:03.102
They needed someone attractive.

30:09.007 --> 30:13.046
You look around,
and there's plenty of angry women...

30:13.344 --> 30:15.551
...and nobody's listening.

30:15.780 --> 30:18.283
But people will listen to you.

30:18.449 --> 30:20.292
You're the créme de Ia créme.

30:20.451 --> 30:22.124
When women like you get angry...

30:22.587 --> 30:25.363
...that's when you know
something's really, really wrong.

30:25.957 --> 30:28.801
So we're your test case.

30:30.228 --> 30:33.903
- You want people to see us.
- Yes.

30:34.065 --> 30:37.569
And hear you, and do right by you.

30:38.303 --> 30:39.304
Now...

30:39.470 --> 30:41.609
...I'm sorry if you feel misled.

30:42.874 --> 30:44.615
But I didn't take this case...

30:44.876 --> 30:46.878
...just to change your lives
for the better.

30:47.045 --> 30:49.685
I took this case
to make some damn noise...

30:49.848 --> 30:51.384
...and change the world.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.923
If we wanna make noise...

30:56.087 --> 30:58.931
...we should hold the press conference
on March 23rd.

30:59.357 --> 31:00.427
Why is that?

31:01.059 --> 31:03.335
News of the Week
will be publishing an article...

31:03.494 --> 31:05.565
...examining the women's movement.

31:05.730 --> 31:08.609
But written by a woman
who is not a regular employee...

31:08.766 --> 31:10.268
<i>mat News of the Week.</i>

31:10.802 --> 31:12.440
Ha, ha!

31:12.670 --> 31:13.944
Jane Hollander...

31:14.105 --> 31:16.107
...where have you been all my life?

31:23.314 --> 31:27.023
Now we just have to get
the rest of the girls back on board.

31:27.185 --> 31:29.290
I'll do it. My contribution
as the latecomer.

31:30.221 --> 31:32.633
That's very good of you, Jane.

31:32.790 --> 31:35.327
- And I've got these too.
- Oh.

31:37.095 --> 31:42.101
- Oh, and take this for...
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

31:49.207 --> 31:51.153
Have you read it?

31:53.478 --> 31:55.958
Oh. Yeah.

31:56.114 --> 31:59.061
And which man in your life
did you think about when you read it?

31:59.584 --> 32:01.154
Both.

32:01.319 --> 32:03.925
You really love both of them?

32:05.390 --> 32:06.994
It's more than...

32:09.894 --> 32:11.931
- What?
- Mm.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.708
Some things should not
be said out loud.

32:14.866 --> 32:17.312
Well, now I really wanna know.

32:21.639 --> 32:23.744
Since I read it...

32:24.575 --> 32:26.919
...I keep fantasizing...

32:27.078 --> 32:28.751
...that they're dying.

32:29.847 --> 32:33.659
You know, sometimes it's Lenny,
and sometimes it's Ned.

32:33.818 --> 32:36.890
And I fret over them...

32:37.055 --> 32:40.264
...and I care for them
while they grow sicker.

32:40.425 --> 32:43.201
And we say such sweet things
to each other...

32:43.361 --> 32:45.204
...but then...

32:45.563 --> 32:47.565
...they're gone.

32:48.766 --> 32:50.643
And I'm just...

32:50.802 --> 32:52.281
...free.

32:54.205 --> 32:57.152
Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill anyone
or anything.

32:58.743 --> 33:02.782
Sometimes I imagine getting
a phone call...

33:02.947 --> 33:06.121
...that both my parents
died in a car accident.

33:06.284 --> 33:07.888
Jane.

33:08.052 --> 33:11.033
Look who has a dark side too.

33:11.189 --> 33:15.569
- But I don't want that.
- Of course. I don't want my thing either.

33:15.727 --> 33:19.971
But sometimes my dad can be
such an asshole.

33:20.131 --> 33:23.305
- How so?
- So many ways.

33:24.469 --> 33:26.642
He had a girlfriend...

33:26.804 --> 33:28.215
...for years.

33:28.773 --> 33:30.446
Madeleine.

33:30.608 --> 33:35.956
My brother and I knew about her,
and my mother knew about her.

33:36.114 --> 33:39.527
And sometimes,
I would hear them arguing about her.

33:40.118 --> 33:43.395
But then my mom just accepted it.

33:44.422 --> 33:46.402
And one day, I asked her why.

33:47.125 --> 33:49.105
And she said:

33:50.261 --> 33:52.332
"What do I care?

33:52.964 --> 33:55.843
It makes my life easier."

33:59.837 --> 34:01.316
Well.

34:28.366 --> 34:29.436
Good morning.

34:32.170 --> 34:35.777
- I must have terrible morning breath.
- Heh, heh.

34:36.641 --> 34:38.382
Thanks for pulling an all-nighter.

34:39.043 --> 34:40.545
That's okay.

34:40.710 --> 34:45.319
My own bed is only
slightly more comfortable than this table.

34:47.018 --> 34:48.964
- You ready?
- Yeah.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.429
I have toothpaste...

34:52.590 --> 34:54.592
...in my desk.

34:57.962 --> 35:04.846

35:37.401 --> 35:40.348
They formed a more radical group
called the Weather Underground.

35:40.505 --> 35:42.712
They say the wanna overthrow
the government.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.512
At least they're not ambitious.
How big are they?

35:44.675 --> 35:47.087
Six were in the house,
but there's hundreds of them.

35:47.245 --> 35:50.124
They're responsible for
the demonstrations in Chicago.

35:50.281 --> 35:51.760
"Days of Rage," they called it.

35:51.916 --> 35:54.590
It's a real smorgasbord
of antiestablishment ideas.

35:54.752 --> 35:57.028
Black power, antiwar,
liberation theology.

35:57.488 --> 35:59.468
- They like to quote Lenin.
- Charming.

35:59.757 --> 36:02.260
- So modern-day revolutionaries.
- Hardly.

36:02.426 --> 36:04.565
They're mostly rich kids.
Professional parents.

36:04.729 --> 36:06.402
Private schools, good colleges.

36:07.098 --> 36:08.839
Rich kids can't be agents of change?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.742
Revolutions are supposed to be
against the power structure.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.348
They're a part of it.

36:13.604 --> 36:15.015
That's the story.

36:15.239 --> 36:17.412
Everybody's gonna have
the details on the bomb.

36:17.575 --> 36:21.955
You have another 24 hours
to unpack the bourgeois kids angle, yes?

36:22.113 --> 36:23.854
- Yes.
- Sir.

36:24.849 --> 36:26.260
- Oh.
- Oh.

36:31.289 --> 36:32.495
Thank you.

36:33.891 --> 36:35.268
Any time.

36:41.933 --> 36:46.075
All of this lays bare the unsavory
fact that the country's legend--

36:46.237 --> 36:47.978
"Unsavory."

36:48.839 --> 36:50.409
Not savory?

36:50.575 --> 36:52.919
So let's just keep our fingers crossed.

36:53.144 --> 36:54.851
- Yeah.
- Yeah, all right.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.661
They did it. They found him.

36:59.984 --> 37:00.985
They got it signed.

37:01.152 --> 37:02.893
The letter boarded a plane
in Saigon earlier.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.663
- Should be here no later than 10:00.
- Thanks.

37:05.823 --> 37:07.268
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

37:07.425 --> 37:09.928
I'll call a messenger to meet
the plane as soon as it lands.

37:10.528 --> 37:12.633
Okay, don't let the plane crash.

37:12.997 --> 37:14.340
It won't.

37:15.700 --> 37:16.838
Ralph's looking for you.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.243
<i>Okay-</i>

37:23.741 --> 37:25.049
Jane.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.220
Where's your smile, pretty girl?

37:34.151 --> 37:35.721
Is that all?

37:46.631 --> 37:49.202
So, ladies...

37:50.101 --> 37:54.550
...I understand that I'm a little late
to the party, but I wanted to tell you all...

37:54.705 --> 37:57.584
...why I don't just think
we should file this complaint.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.085
I think we have to file it.

38:01.512 --> 38:03.321
I call it the Jangle.

38:05.516 --> 38:08.656
Takes me an hour and 15 minutes
to get ready for work every morning.

38:09.487 --> 38:11.899
And sometimes
I think about how much earlier...

38:12.056 --> 38:14.366
...I have to start my day than the guys.

38:14.525 --> 38:15.697
Mm...

38:15.860 --> 38:20.206
But what if one morning I get up,
and the power is out in my building...

38:20.364 --> 38:22.708
...and I can't curl my hair?

38:23.067 --> 38:25.240
Or see to put on my makeup.

38:25.870 --> 38:28.111
Oh, the horror. Ha, ha, ha!

38:29.573 --> 38:34.249
Why, then, do I feel embarrassed
to ask my reporter what he needs?

38:36.747 --> 38:38.351
Why do I feel...

38:38.516 --> 38:41.292
...like I've already failed at my job?

38:48.092 --> 38:50.436
I'll let him know as soon as he returns.

38:51.295 --> 38:52.968
No problem.

38:53.130 --> 38:55.167
All right, thank you.

39:32.703 --> 39:35.149
I can't thank you enough.

39:37.108 --> 39:39.145
It was all of us.

39:45.516 --> 39:48.190
We'll say at time of printing
there were three fatalities.

39:48.352 --> 39:51.424
Did you know that Ted Gold
was in the Stamp Club at Stuyvesant?

39:51.589 --> 39:54.968
He went from collecting stamps
to making pipe bombs.

39:55.126 --> 39:59.404
- I wonder where those girls are right now.
- Probably in some motel room...

39:59.563 --> 40:01.099
...opening a bottle of hair dye.

40:01.265 --> 40:05.975
You can't dress up in a cause because
you like being seen as a revolutionary.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.549
Doing more than playing dress-up.
They leveled the building.

40:08.706 --> 40:12.017
They might not make as much sense
as the Black Panthers, the Nuyoricans...

40:12.176 --> 40:15.316
-...but they've got something in common.
- What?

40:16.046 --> 40:17.650
They're fed up.

40:34.265 --> 40:37.246
I'm so nervous,
I feel like I could pass out.

40:39.503 --> 40:40.880
It's a nice neighborhood.

40:41.505 --> 40:43.109
Mm...

40:48.712 --> 40:49.850
Hi, come on in.

40:50.014 --> 40:52.585
I just need to finish dinner
and wash up.

40:57.321 --> 40:59.494
He-- He is very good.

41:01.525 --> 41:03.163
I, uh...

41:03.427 --> 41:05.100
...l-- I never...

41:05.262 --> 41:07.868
...had any problems after.

41:33.057 --> 41:34.536
What?

41:36.327 --> 41:38.204
I like watching you work.

41:40.397 --> 41:41.705
You're tired.

41:42.733 --> 41:43.973
Tell you what...

41:44.134 --> 41:46.136
...give me another half hour...

41:46.303 --> 41:49.341
...and we'll go to my place.
I'll make you some French toast.

41:49.507 --> 41:52.579
You like French toast? How do
I not know if you like French Toast?

41:54.011 --> 41:55.752
That sounds really good...

41:55.913 --> 41:59.258
...but I think, if you don't need me...

41:59.416 --> 42:01.362
...I'm gonna head out.

42:01.519 --> 42:05.763
Catch up on sleep
in my own crappy bed.

42:07.591 --> 42:09.002
Yeah.

42:09.793 --> 42:11.397
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:12.062 --> 42:14.872
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

42:38.455 --> 42:40.799
Sorry, we're not in a rush.

42:40.958 --> 42:43.029
Drive carefully, please.

42:48.732 --> 42:51.178
Cindy, can I ask you something?

42:51.835 --> 42:53.473
Of course.

42:54.538 --> 42:56.950
What have you girls been up to?

42:57.675 --> 42:59.245
That day by the copier.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.583
I see you meet in the bathroom.

43:06.483 --> 43:09.123
We are suing the magazine...

43:10.888 --> 43:12.526
...for the right...

43:12.690 --> 43:14.863
...to be reporters.

43:15.759 --> 43:20.139
It's illegal that they to tell us
we can only work in the pit.

43:47.891 --> 43:49.768
What'd you get?

43:50.628 --> 43:53.108
- Just a harmless Twinkie.
- Ha, ha.

43:53.864 --> 43:56.504
- Want one?
- Sure. Thank you.

43:58.669 --> 44:00.876
- You wanna hear something ironic?
- Mm-hm.

44:01.338 --> 44:03.045
We paid for it with my money.

44:04.274 --> 44:07.118
We used my inheritance
from my grandma for the down payment.

44:07.478 --> 44:11.688
Then the bank would only put
the mortgage in Brian's name.

44:15.586 --> 44:18.260
I know where your name would count.

44:24.194 --> 44:25.901
<i>Okay-</i>

44:26.230 --> 44:27.265
Yeah, I'm in.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.941
- Really?
- Yes.

44:32.136 --> 44:33.410
- Ah.
-om

44:33.570 --> 44:34.674
Hi, there.

44:34.838 --> 44:38.547
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm looking for the, uh, transport desk.

44:38.709 --> 44:41.781
- We're the transport desk. I'll take that.
- And I'll take this.

44:41.945 --> 44:43.754
Sign right there.

44:44.782 --> 44:46.261
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

44:51.455 --> 44:52.456
Oh, my goodness.

44:52.623 --> 44:55.763
That envelope looks like
it fought for our country.

44:56.093 --> 44:59.700
This is it.
Look there, it's where he signed it.

45:00.631 --> 45:02.975
His hand must have been dirty.

45:31.695 --> 45:32.935
Robinson.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.609
Do you know it's dangerous
to walk alone?

45:36.767 --> 45:38.178
Blowing shit up around here.

45:38.669 --> 45:40.205
Yeah, I read about that.

45:40.871 --> 45:44.444
- Get in.
- No, I like the fresh air, so...

45:46.276 --> 45:47.846
Really?

45:48.512 --> 45:50.583
Smells like garbage.

46:02.693 --> 46:06.436
Raymond,
Perry and West 4th Street, please.

46:12.236 --> 46:14.580
So I didn't make it
to the club the other night.

46:14.738 --> 46:16.217
How was it?

46:18.242 --> 46:19.721
Sweaty.

46:20.778 --> 46:22.519
And...

46:22.679 --> 46:24.056
...all encompassing.

46:24.214 --> 46:26.490
But I don't think...

46:26.650 --> 46:30.359
...I learned anything new about jazz.

46:34.458 --> 46:37.928
What do you suppose
would've happened if I had shown up?

46:39.129 --> 46:42.201
- We would have talked about music.
- Sure.

46:43.467 --> 46:45.071
You would have ordered a Scotch.

46:45.235 --> 46:47.408
I would have ordered...

46:47.971 --> 46:50.281
...beer and some wings.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.579
You would have offered to expense it.

46:52.743 --> 46:54.518
Well, I'm good like that.

46:55.946 --> 47:00.691
I would've gone to the ladies' room and
realized I had barbecue sauce on my face.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.265
That sounds like a delightful night.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.426
Yeah, you missed out.

47:07.357 --> 47:10.304
Patti, I want to apologize
for standing you up.

47:15.165 --> 47:18.840
You know, my, uh--
My oldest daughter Lydia...

47:19.369 --> 47:21.280
...she always got her nose in a book.

47:21.438 --> 47:24.317
Likes to make believe
she's from another time and place.

47:24.474 --> 47:27.614
Called me a foulmouthed hooligan
the other day.

47:28.245 --> 47:31.158
My youngest, she's a sponge.

47:31.448 --> 47:34.429
Takes in everything around her.
Always asking questions.

47:34.585 --> 47:36.724
"Why, Dad? Why and how?"

47:37.688 --> 47:39.895
She's sharp as a tack.

47:40.624 --> 47:43.730
She's kind of a Patti Robinson type.

47:43.894 --> 47:46.932
I shouldn't have given you that ticket.

47:47.097 --> 47:50.010
That was inappropriate. I just, ah...

47:51.501 --> 47:52.878
I like talking to you.

47:53.036 --> 47:54.037
I-

47:54.204 --> 47:55.945
...like how you think.

47:56.106 --> 47:57.551
I admire it.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.278
That's good.

47:59.676 --> 48:03.681
Because I'll tell you, I-- I wanna be
a guy that Patti Robinson admires.

48:05.682 --> 48:08.492
And it wasn't wrong of you
to offer me that ticket.

48:08.819 --> 48:10.594
It was wrong of me to take it.

48:12.222 --> 48:14.259
Then why did you?

48:17.728 --> 48:19.730
I'm not a saint.

48:41.084 --> 48:42.961
For the record.

48:43.287 --> 48:46.393
I hoped you weren't a saint.
