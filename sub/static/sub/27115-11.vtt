- Literally, she went outside
for ten seconds

39:58.130 --> 40:00.864
and all of a sudden she's like,
no, "Carter's texting me,

40:00.899 --> 40:03.032
you have no idea
what's going on in LA."

40:03.068 --> 40:05.835
- Girls are at the guys' night
in their hotel room.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.904
- I wonder if he texted her
that those girls were there.

40:07.939 --> 40:10.006
- But also if you trust
your mother----ing men

40:10.041 --> 40:11.841
then why does it matter
that Peter brought girls?

40:11.877 --> 40:13.877
- Our boys called us on
the patio and they were like,

40:13.912 --> 40:15.445
we feel uncomfortable
because girls are here,

40:15.480 --> 40:16.880
'cause Peter brought girls.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.782
- Is James there?
- Yeah.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.383
- Oh.

40:20.419 --> 40:22.952
- Let's stop acting like James
has some sort of power

40:22.988 --> 40:25.188
over everybody to make
people feel a certain way.

40:25.223 --> 40:28.091
Like, I think all of us
still have no idea what it was

40:28.126 --> 40:31.194
that set her into this spiral.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.229
- I'm sorry, I just think
Carter's, like,

40:33.265 --> 40:34.731
not good for her.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.099
- No, sh--
Carter's not good for her.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.268
They're miserable.
She says this every day,

40:38.303 --> 40:40.236
- What is the Carter connection
to the traveling?

40:40.272 --> 40:43.540
- This is not about her, like,
having anxiety about traveling.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.408
- He always has to have
the last word about everything

40:45.444 --> 40:47.477
and I get to a point where
I'm just like, "Okay, fine."

40:47.512 --> 40:49.245
I literally walk around
like this.

40:49.281 --> 40:50.880
I'm like, "Stop it, stop it."
Like, "If you're just not

40:50.916 --> 40:52.482
gonna be nice to me,
then just don't talk to me."

40:52.517 --> 40:54.250
And then he'll be like,
"You're a crazy psycho bitch."

40:54.286 --> 40:55.785
I'm like, "Wow."

40:55.821 --> 40:57.153
He complains
that we don't have sex.

40:57.189 --> 40:58.421
I'm so tired of it.

40:58.457 --> 41:00.924
I'm just--
I'm not ----ing happy.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.126
- Then what is wrong?
- He doesn't give a (BLEEP).

41:03.161 --> 41:05.061
He doesn't pay for anything.
He doesn't pay rent.

41:05.096 --> 41:08.097
He doesn't do anything.
He literally does nothing.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.566
Nothing.

41:09.601 --> 41:11.434
- The beans have been spilled.
- Oh, my God.

41:11.470 --> 41:15.171
That--this was not my place,
and now I feel like (BLEEP).

41:15.207 --> 41:16.973
- Well...
- That was not my place,

41:17.008 --> 41:19.108
that was not my ----ing place,
that was not my place.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.110
I feel so weird right now.
- It's fine.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.946
You know, just go with it.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.948
- That is gonna come out
at some point.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.015
- She talks about it
with me, too. I know it.

41:26.051 --> 41:27.917
Everybody knows it.

41:27.953 --> 41:29.786
Everyone knows it,
but no one says it.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.921
This is what she's so upset
about because, you know what,

41:31.957 --> 41:34.123
it would be one thing
if she was paying

41:34.159 --> 41:35.158
for everything
and he was nice to her.

41:35.193 --> 41:37.093
- Yeah, you're right.

41:37.128 --> 41:40.263
- If he wanted to go to ----ing
therapy when she asked him

41:40.298 --> 41:42.999
to go to couple's therapy,
then that would be different.

41:43.034 --> 41:45.134
But he doesn't want
to do any of it.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.203
Kristen's anger is misdirected.

41:47.239 --> 41:49.105
She doesn't give a (BLEEP)
about James.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.308
He's just a convenient excuse
to mask her issues with Carter,

41:52.344 --> 41:53.977
which she needs to face.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.812
- She doesn't have to put up
a front with us.

41:55.847 --> 41:56.846
- But she does it every day.
- We are all here

41:56.882 --> 41:58.348
to ----ing pick her up.

41:58.383 --> 42:00.483
- And again, it's not that
Carter's a bad guy--

42:00.519 --> 42:03.987
- Honestly, you know what?
Somebody refuses to pay rent

42:04.022 --> 42:06.322
and pay
bills and pay for anything

42:06.358 --> 42:07.624
actually kind of is a bad guy.
