02:50.800 --> 02:52.000
Tactical!

03:12.400 --> 03:13.600
Visual!

03:20.520 --> 03:21.720
Prepare torpedos!

03:30.480 --> 03:31.720
Attention!

03:34.800 --> 03:35.800
Fire!

04:00.680 --> 04:01.680
Evade

04:09.440 --> 04:13.920
This is com station Epsilon 9
calling USS Columbia.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.680
Come in, Columbia.
Respond, please.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.959
This is Scout Columbia, Epsilon 9.
Could you boost your transmission?

04:22.560 --> 04:24.480
This is Epsilon 9, Columbia.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.080
Am boosting output.
How read you this?

04:27.120 --> 04:30.600
Fine, fine. Thank you, Epsilon 9.
Receiving your transmission.

04:30.680 --> 04:34.040
Scout Columbia, NCC-621...

04:34.120 --> 04:38.520
to rendezvous with
Scout Revere, NCC-595...

04:38.600 --> 04:41.600
on stardate 7411.4.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.680
Further orders
will be relayed at that time.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.280
Signed Commodore Prober
to Starfleet.

04:47.360 --> 04:51.200
- End of transmission.
- Received. Thank you.

05:10.200 --> 05:13.440
Our sensor drone is
intercepting this on Quad L-1 4.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.440
That's within Klingon boundaries.
Who are they fighting?

05:16.480 --> 05:18.360
Unknown, Sir.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.240
I have an exterior visual.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.100
Attention!

06:05.200 --> 06:06.200
Fire!

06:32.040 --> 06:35.240
We've plotted a course
on that cloud, Commander.

06:35.320 --> 06:39.320
It will pass into Federation space
fairly close to us.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.960
Heading?

06:41.000 --> 06:44.640
Sir, it's on a precise
heading for Earth.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.840
Commander Sonak.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.040
You received your appointment
as Enterprise science officer?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.040
Based, I am told, on your
recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.320
Then why aren't you aboard?

10:23.360 --> 10:25.920
Captain Decker requested I complete
final science briefing here before...

10:26.000 --> 10:27.520
- Here?
- we leave on our mission.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.200
At Starfleet?

10:30.080 --> 10:32.720
The Enterprise is in
final preparation to leave dock.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.680
Which will require
20 more hours at minimum...

10:34.760 --> 10:36.480
Twelve.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.440
I'm on my way to a meeting
with Admiral Nogura...

10:38.480 --> 10:40.480
which will not last
more than three minutes.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.480
Report to me on the Enterprise
in one hour.

10:42.520 --> 10:43.560
Report to you, Sir?

10:43.680 --> 10:48.280
It is my intention to be
on that ship following that meeting.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.200
Report to me in one hour.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.320
- Admiral!
- Mr. Scott.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.520
Those departure orders... 12 hours.
Starfleet cannot be serious.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.560
Why aren't the Enterprise
transporters operating, Mr. Scott?

12:05.920 --> 12:07.760
A wee problem, Sir.
Just temporary.

12:07.880 --> 12:10.080
Admiral, we have just
finished 18 months...

12:10.120 --> 12:11.960
redesigning and refitting
the Enterprise.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.080
How in hell do they expect me
to have her ready in 12 hours?

12:14.720 --> 12:16.520
Take me over, please.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.200
She needs more work, Sir.
A shakedown!

12:22.280 --> 12:26.760
Mr. Scott, an alien object of
unbelievable destructive power...

12:26.840 --> 12:29.440
is less than three days away
from this planet.

12:29.480 --> 12:33.200
The only starship in interception
range is the Enterprise.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.280
Ready or not,
she launches in 12 hours.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.640
The crew haven't had
near enough transition time...

12:58.720 --> 13:00.560
with all the new equipment.

13:01.760 --> 13:06.280
And the engines...
They're not even tested at warp power.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.000
And an untried Captain.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.440
Two-and-a-half years as
chief of Starfleet Operations...

13:10.480 --> 13:12.560
may have made me
a little stale, but I...

13:12.600 --> 13:15.640
wouldn't exactly
consider myself untried.

13:19.240 --> 13:22.640
- They gave her back to me, Scotty.
- Gave her back, Sir?

13:22.680 --> 13:24.960
I doubt it was that easy
with Nogura.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.640
You're right.

13:29.360 --> 13:33.560
Well, any man who could
manage such a feat...

13:33.680 --> 13:36.400
I would not dare disappoint.

13:36.480 --> 13:40.200
She'll launch on time, Sir,
and she'll be ready.

18:18.360 --> 18:21.280
- Thank you, Mr. Scott.
- Aye, Sir.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.800
Cargo bay to launch crew.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.560
A travel pod is now
available at dock 6.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.440
- Permission to come aboard, Sir.
- Granted, Sir.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.000
Welcome aboard, Admiral.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.280
Commander Scott, you're needed
in Engineering immediately.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.160
Sir, you'll excuse me.

18:38.920 --> 18:42.720
Flight deck, prepare
for an incoming shuttlecraft.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.320
If you'll follow me,
I'll show you...

18:46.400 --> 18:47.840
I think I can find
my way, Ensign.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.920
Aye, Sir.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.480
Bridge.

19:01.040 --> 19:01.920
What's the problem?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.400
I thought you people had
that circuit patched in an hour ago.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.760
We did. We had to disconnect it.

19:06.880 --> 19:07.960
All right. Take out...

19:08.040 --> 19:10.440
It's going to take us longer
that way. We're trying to save time.

19:11.640 --> 19:14.520
I'm still waiting for a check
on the line. What's holding it up?

19:14.560 --> 19:17.920
As soon as somebody
can get to it.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.800
What's the next program?

19:19.840 --> 19:21.920
I'll get somebody down there
as soon as I can, Cleary.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.640
My people are all tied up now.

19:27.360 --> 19:31.080
Captain! Starfleet just signaled
your transfer of command orders.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.240
- Captain.
- I appreciate the welcome.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.360
I wish the circumstances
were less critical.

19:38.440 --> 19:41.400
Epsilon 9 is monitoring the intruder.
Keep a channel open to them.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.720
Aye, Sir.

19:43.840 --> 19:47.280
- Where's Captain Decker?
- He's in Engineering, Sir.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.880
He... He doesn't know.

19:52.480 --> 19:54.200
- Mr. Chekov.
- Aye, Sir.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.960
Assemble the crew on
the recreation deck at 0400 hours.

19:57.880 --> 20:00.720
I want to show them
what we're facing.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.520
Check Cleary on number six.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.440
- Need your cooler status.
- Stand by.

20:33.520 --> 20:38.240
Space matrix restoration coils.
Dilithium crystals.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.520
I knew it. The transporter sensor
was not activated.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.080
Air equalization.
Automatic off.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.360
Faulty module.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.120
Cleary, put a new backup sensor
into the unit.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.640
Aye, Sir.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.960
Admiral Kirk! Well,
we're getting a top brass send-off.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.320
Don't worry,
she'll launch on schedule...

20:56.360 --> 20:58.560
if we have to tow her out
with our bare hands, right, Scotty?

20:58.600 --> 21:01.480
Aye. That we will, Sir.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.600
- Let's talk.
- Sure.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.000
Let me know
when that backup's ready.

21:07.080 --> 21:10.200
All due respect, I hope this isn't
some kind of Starfleet pep talk.

21:10.280 --> 21:13.080
- I'm really too busy.
- I'm taking over the center seat.

21:13.920 --> 21:14.960
You're what?

21:15.080 --> 21:17.560
I'm replacing you as Captain
of the Enterprise.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.760
You'll stay on
as executive officer.

21:20.800 --> 21:23.360
Temporary grade reduction
to Commander.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.640
You personally
are assuming command?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.160
Yeah.

21:29.240 --> 21:33.440
- May I ask why?
- My experience.

21:33.520 --> 21:37.440
Five years out there
dealing with unknowns like this.

21:37.520 --> 21:39.600
My familiarity with
the Enterprise and its crew.

21:39.680 --> 21:42.800
Admiral, this is an almost
totally new Enterprise.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.720
You don't know her a tenth
as well as I do.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.040
That's why you're staying aboard.

21:52.360 --> 21:53.640
I'm sorry, Will.

21:54.440 --> 21:57.360
No, Admiral,
I don't think you're sorry.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.560
Not one damn bit.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.360
I remember when you recommended me
for this command.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.720
You told me how envious you were
and how much you hoped...

22:05.760 --> 22:07.960
you'd find a way to get
a starship command again.

22:10.240 --> 22:14.520
Well, Sir,
it looks like you found a way.

22:17.880 --> 22:21.200
Report to the bridge,
Commander, immediately.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.640
Aye, Sir.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.800
Transporter room!
Come in! Urgent!

22:38.880 --> 22:40.720
Redline on the transporter,
Mr. Scott!

22:40.760 --> 22:42.920
Transporter, do not engage!

22:42.960 --> 22:44.880
-It's too late. They're beaming now.
- Do not...

22:46.760 --> 22:50.600
Do you read me, Starfleet?
Override it! Pull them back!

22:50.640 --> 22:53.560
Unable to retrieve their pattern,
Enterprise.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.960
Give it to me.

23:05.920 --> 23:10.080
Starfleet, boost your matter gain.
We need more signal.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.480
More signal!

23:15.520 --> 23:19.360
- We're losing their pattern!
- Oh, no, they're forming.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.800
Oh my God.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.080
Starfleet, do you have them?

23:47.240 --> 23:52.320
Enterprise, what we got back
didn 't live long, fortunately.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.320
Starfleet, Kirk.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.080
Please express my condolences
to their families.

24:05.800 --> 24:08.720
Commander Sonak's can be reached
through the Vulcan embassy.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.440
There was nothing
you could have done, Rand.

24:17.520 --> 24:20.160
It wasn't your fault.

24:42.720 --> 24:44.600
Yeoman, turboshaft 8?

24:44.680 --> 24:46.480
Back that way, Sir.

24:53.040 --> 24:56.040
We have to replace
Commander Sonak.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.680
I'd still like a Vulcan there,
if possible.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.120
None available, Captain.

25:01.160 --> 25:04.400
In fact, there's no one
who's fully rated on this design.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.880
You are, Mr. Decker.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.960
I'm afraid you're going to have
to double as science officer.

25:40.360 --> 25:42.360
That's all we know about it...

25:43.880 --> 25:47.720
except that it is now
53.4 hours away from Earth.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.480
Enterprise is the only Federation
starship that stands in its way.

26:00.840 --> 26:04.280
Our orders are to intercept...

26:04.040 --> 26:07.520
investigate and take
whatever action is necessary...

26:08.400 --> 26:09.280
and possible.

26:24.480 --> 26:27.920
Bridge to Captain.
Priority signal from Epsilon 9.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.840
- Put it on viewer.
- On viewer, Sir.

26:29.600 --> 26:34.240
Enterprise, the cloud is definitely
a power field of some kind.

26:34.400 --> 26:39.640
Measures... My God...
over eight two AU's in diameter.

26:39.920 --> 26:44.400
Must be something incredible
inside there generating it.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.240
We're transmitting lingua code
friendship messages...

26:47.320 --> 26:49.000
on all frequencies.

26:49.000 --> 26:49.960
No response.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.880
have a null reading
at the center of the cloud.

26:52.160 --> 26:55.440
Definitely something inside there,
but scans are being reflected back.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.960
- Some kind of power surge.
- Receiving an odd pattern now.

26:59.040 --> 27:02.160
Enterprise, they could be mistaking
our scans as a hostile act.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.080
They seem to be reactingto our scans, Sir.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.000
Deflectors, emergency full!

27:08.240 --> 27:10.920
- We are under attack.
- External view.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.280
Viewer off.

28:10.920 --> 28:11.920
Viewer off.

28:22.920 --> 28:25.080
Prelaunch countdown
will commence in 40 minutes.

28:45.240 --> 28:48.880
Transporter system fully repaired
and functioning normally, Sir.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.360
Dock signals clear, Captain.

28:50.440 --> 28:53.080
Reply we are holding position,
awaiting final crew replacements.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.040
Aye, Sir.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.680
Transporter personnel reports...

28:57.720 --> 28:59.400
the navigator, Lieutenant Ilia...

28:59.680 --> 29:02.680
She's already aboard
and en route to the bridge, Sir.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.360
She's Deltan, Captain.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.480
Lieutenant Ilia
reporting for duty, Sir.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.440
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.

29:17.720 --> 29:19.920
- Hello, Ilia.
- Decker.

29:20.160 --> 29:23.520
I was stationed on the lieutenant's
home planet some years ago.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.680
Commander Decker?

29:26.720 --> 29:28.520
Yes, our exec and science officer.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.960
Captain Kirk has
the utmost confidence in me.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.120
And in you, too, Lieutenant.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.560
My oath of celibacy
is on record, Captain.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.040
- May I assume my duties?
- By all means.

29:41.560 --> 29:45.600
Starfleet reports our last six
crew members are ready to beam up...

29:45.680 --> 29:49.160
but one of them is refusing
to step into the transporter.

29:49.240 --> 29:53.000
Oh? I'll see to it
that he beams up.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.720
Transporter room.

30:14.560 --> 30:17.160
Well, for a man who swore
he'd never return to Starfleet...

30:17.240 --> 30:21.920
Just a moment, Captain, Sir.
I'll explain what happened.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.120
Your revered Admiral Nogura
invoked a little-known...

30:25.200 --> 30:28.640
seldom-used reserve activation clause.

30:28.680 --> 30:31.680
In simpler language, Captain,
they drafted me!

30:31.720 --> 30:33.600
They didn't.

30:35.080 --> 30:38.040
This was your idea.
This was your idea, wasn't it?

30:38.120 --> 30:39.720
Bones, there's a thing out there.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.720
Why is any object we don't
understand always called a thing?

30:42.760 --> 30:45.960
Headed this way. I need you.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.280
Damn it, Bones, I need you.

30:52.440 --> 30:54.280
Badly!

31:05.920 --> 31:07.720
Permission to come aboard.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.040
Permission granted, Sir.

31:14.320 --> 31:19.320
Well, Jim,
I hear Chapel's an MD now.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.520
Well, I'm going
to need a top nurse...

31:21.640 --> 31:24.480
not a doctor who will argue
every little diagnosis with me.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.800
And they probably redesigned
the whole sick bay too!

31:28.920 --> 31:31.320
I know engineers.
They love to change things.

31:51.880 --> 31:54.240
Dock control reports ready, Sir.

31:55.240 --> 31:58.280
- Helm ready, Sir.
- Orbital departure on plot, Sir.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.640
Yard command signaling clear, Sir.

32:00.680 --> 32:04.480
- Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
- Maneuvering thrusters, Sir.

32:04.520 --> 32:06.680
Hold station.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.920
Thrusters at station-keeping, Sir.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.800
Thrusters ahead, Mr. Sulu.

32:34.280 --> 32:35.720
Take us out.

33:55.720 --> 33:59.320
Intermix set, Bridge.
Impulse power at your discretion.

33:59.360 --> 34:01.240
Impulse power, Mr. Sulu.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.320
Ahead warp .5.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.159
Departure angle on viewer.

34:20.280 --> 34:22.120
Departure angle.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.880
- Viewer ahead.
- Viewer ahead.

34:51.920 --> 34:55.440
Captain 's Log.:
Stardate 7412.6...

34:55.520 --> 34:57.920
1.8 hours from launch.

34:57.960 --> 35:01.920
In order to intercept the intruder
at the earliest possible time...

35:01.920 --> 35:05.920
we must now risk engaging warp drive
while still within the solar system.

35:05.960 --> 35:10.080
Captain, assuming we have
full warp capability...

35:10.080 --> 35:12.920
accelerating to warp 7 on leaving
the solar system...

35:12.960 --> 35:17.160
will bring us to IP with
the intruder in 20.1 hours.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.680
Science Officer competition.
Confirm, Sir

35:29.960 --> 35:33.080
Well, Bones, do the new medical
facilities meet with your approval?

35:33.120 --> 35:36.600
They do not. It's like working
in a damn computer center.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.960
- Programming ready?
- Set for standard warp entry.

35:40.040 --> 35:43.040
But I still recommend
further simulation study.

35:43.120 --> 35:48.640
Mr. Decker, every minute brings
that object closer to Earth.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.360
Engineering,
stand by for warp drive.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.960
Captain, we need further warp
simulation on the flow sensors.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.560
Engineer, we need warp speed now!

35:56.640 --> 36:00.080
Jim, you're pushing.

36:02.240 --> 36:05.240
Your people know their jobs.

36:05.320 --> 36:08.360
That's it, Sir.
I can't do any better.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.440
Aye, lad.

36:13.520 --> 36:16.760
It's borderline on the simulator.
I cannot guarantee she'll hold up.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.520
Warp drive, Mr. Scott.

36:18.600 --> 36:22.320
- Ahead warp 1 , Mr. Sulu.
- Accelerating to warp 1, Sir.

36:24.920 --> 36:29.280
Warp .7, .8.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.200
Warp 1 , Sir.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.720
Mr. Decker...

36:47.520 --> 36:51.080
Wormhole. Get us back
on impulse power. Full reverse.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.600
Negative helm control, Captain.
Going reverse on impulse power.

37:07.680 --> 37:09.600
Subspace frequencies jammed, Sir!

37:09.680 --> 37:11.600
Wormhole effect!

37:22.000 --> 37:24.920
Negative control from inertial lag
will continue 22.5 seconds...

37:25.040 --> 37:27.160
before forward velocity
slows to sublight speed.

37:27.280 --> 37:30.480
Unidentified small object has been
pulled into the wormhole with us.

37:30.520 --> 37:33.320
- Directly ahead.
- Force fields up full.

37:33.320 --> 37:35.200
Put object on viewer.

37:39.920 --> 37:43.240
- Go manual override on helm.
- No manual response, Sir.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.720
Navigational deflectors
coming up, Sir.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.320
Wormhole distortion has overloaded
the main power systems.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.880
Navigational deflectors
inoperative, Captain.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.760
Directional control also inoperative.

38:00.200 --> 38:02.400
Time to impact?

38:02.480 --> 38:05.080
Twenty seconds.

38:05.200 --> 38:08.960
Mr. Chekov, stand by on phasers.

38:09.040 --> 38:10.720
No!

38:13.760 --> 38:17.400
Belay that phaser order!

38:27.040 --> 38:28.240
Arm photon torpedoes!

38:30.400 --> 38:34.080
Photon torpedoes...

38:44.640 --> 38:46.520
armed!

38:52.160 --> 38:55.320
Object is an asteroid.

38:55.360 --> 38:58.200
Reading mass .7.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.920
Targeting...

39:03.000 --> 39:06.440
asteroid!

39:07.120 --> 39:10.720
Impact in ten seconds.

39:16.480 --> 39:19.360
Impact in eight seconds.

39:19.400 --> 39:22.720
- Fire torpedoes!
- Six!

39:22.720 --> 39:25.600
Torpedoes away!

39:25.680 --> 39:27.160
Five!

40:01.720 --> 40:03.560
Helm control restored, Sir.

40:06.680 --> 40:10.320
- Position report, Navigator.
- Computing new intersection course.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.280
Communications are normal, Sir.

40:12.320 --> 40:14.080
Negative damage reported, Captain.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.680
No casualties reported, Doctor.

40:16.720 --> 40:19.480
Wrong, Mr. Chekov.There are casualties.

40:19.520 --> 40:24.960
My wits, as in
"frightened out of," Captain, Sir.

40:25.080 --> 40:28.920
We were at warp .8.
Engineer, report your status there.

40:29.960 --> 40:33.000
In just a second, Exec. We're
picking up the pieces down here.

40:35.360 --> 40:37.240
Mr. Scott, we need warp drive
as soon as possible.

40:37.320 --> 40:41.800
The engine imbalance created
the wormhole in the first place.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.680
It'll happen again
if we don't correct it.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.200
That object is less than
two days away from Earth.

40:46.320 --> 40:48.160
We need to intercept
while it still is out there.

40:49.360 --> 40:54.120
Lay in a heading to conform with
our initial IP with the intruder.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.520
Mr. Sulu, you have the com.
Mr. Decker.

40:57.800 --> 41:01.640
-I'd like to see you in my quarters.
-Mind if I tag along, Captain?

41:05.520 --> 41:07.400
Level 5.

41:14.280 --> 41:17.160
All right, explanation. Why was
my phaser order countermanded?

41:17.240 --> 41:19.240
The Enterprise redesign
increases phaser power...

41:19.640 --> 41:21.560
by channeling it
through the main engines.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.640
When they went into
antimatter imbalance...

41:24.680 --> 41:26.560
the phasers were
automatically cut off.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.400
Then you acted properly, of course.

41:33.640 --> 41:35.480
Thank you, Sir.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.520
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.

41:39.560 --> 41:42.080
- You saved the ship.
- I'm aware of that, Sir.

41:43.360 --> 41:45.880
Stop competing with me, Decker.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.560
- Permission to speak freely, Sir?
- Granted.

41:50.600 --> 41:55.480
Sir, you haven't logged a single
star hour in two-and-a-half years.

41:55.560 --> 41:57.560
That, plus your unfamiliarity
with the ship's redesign...

41:57.640 --> 42:00.720
in my opinion, Sir, seriously
jeopardizes this mission.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.480
I trust you will...

42:09.600 --> 42:12.000
nursemaid me through
these difficulties?

42:12.920 --> 42:14.240
Yes, Sir, I'll do that.

42:14.280 --> 42:17.320
Then I won't keep you from
your duties any longer, Commander.

42:17.440 --> 42:19.480
- Yes, Doctor?
- Aye, Sir.

42:25.840 --> 42:27.440
He may be right, Jim.

42:36.200 --> 42:39.960
- Was it difficult?
- No more than I expected.

42:40.040 --> 42:44.480
About as difficult
as seeing you again.

42:44.600 --> 42:48.080
- I'm sorry.
- That you left Delta IV?

42:48.200 --> 42:50.480
Or that you didn't
even say good-bye?

42:52.920 --> 42:56.040
If I had seen you again...

42:56.080 --> 42:57.920
would you have been
able to say it?

43:00.320 --> 43:02.160
No.

43:14.440 --> 43:16.280
Make your point, Doctor.

43:16.320 --> 43:19.320
The point, Captain, is that
it's you who is competing.

43:19.360 --> 43:21.960
You rammed getting this command
down Starfleet's throat.

43:22.080 --> 43:25.200
You've used this emergency
to get the Enterprise back.

43:28.200 --> 43:30.120
And I intend to keep her,
is that what you're saying?

43:30.120 --> 43:31.920
Yes.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.840
It's an obsession.

43:33.920 --> 43:35.760
An obsession that can blind you...

43:35.840 --> 43:39.080
to far more immediate
and critical responsibilities.

43:39.120 --> 43:43.200
Your reaction to Decker
is an example, Jim.

43:43.240 --> 43:47.400
- Bridge to Captain.
- Viewer on.

43:47.440 --> 43:50.680
Signal from a Federation registered
long-range shuttle, Sir.

43:50.720 --> 43:53.720
She wishes to come alongside
and lock on.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.680
For what purpose?

43:55.520 --> 43:58.320
My security scan shows it has
a grade-one priority, Captain.

43:58.920 --> 44:00.920
Non belligerency confirmed.

44:00.960 --> 44:03.800
I suspect it is a courier
of some kind.

44:03.880 --> 44:06.000
Very well, Mr. Chekov.
See to it.

44:06.680 --> 44:09.280
Viewer off.

44:09.080 --> 44:12.480
Your opinion has been noted.
Anything further?

44:14.120 --> 44:15.680
That depends on you.

45:27.840 --> 45:32.640
Security scan.: one boarder.
Identity: Starfleet, inactive.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.040
- Permission to come aboard, Sir.
- Granted, Sir.

45:40.840 --> 45:43.720
Gran... ted.

45:53.800 --> 45:55.680
Why... Why, it's Mister...

45:55.920 --> 45:58.280
Spock!

46:00.480 --> 46:02.480
Spock.

46:07.800 --> 46:10.040
Commander, if I may?

46:11.000 --> 46:13.240
If... Oh.

46:22.920 --> 46:26.280
I've been monitoring your
communications with Starfleet.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.920
I'm aware of your
engine design difficulties.

46:31.320 --> 46:34.920
I offer my services
as science officer...

46:34.960 --> 46:37.320
with all due respect,
Commander.

46:37.320 --> 46:39.520
- If our exec has no objections.
- Of course not.

46:39.560 --> 46:41.520
I'm well aware of
Mr. Spock's qualifications.

46:41.600 --> 46:45.120
Mr. Chekov, log Mr. Spock's
Starfleet commission reactivated.

46:45.160 --> 46:50.760
List him as science officer.
Both effective immediately.

46:51.920 --> 46:53.000
Mr. Spock.

46:53.120 --> 46:55.960
Well, so help me,
I'm actually pleased to see you.

47:08.320 --> 47:10.280
It's how we all feel, Mr. Spock.

47:10.320 --> 47:12.240
Captain, with your permission...

47:12.320 --> 47:14.960
I will now discuss these
fuel equations with the engineer.

47:19.320 --> 47:21.120
Mr. Spock.

47:21.160 --> 47:23.080
Welcome aboard.

47:45.840 --> 47:49.720
Captain 's Log.:
Stardate 7413.4.

47:49.800 --> 47:53.640
Thanks to Mr. Spock's
timely arrival and assistance...

47:53.720 --> 47:57.120
we have the engines rebalanced
into full warp capacity.

47:57.240 --> 47:59.160
Repair time.:
less than three hours.

47:59.280 --> 48:01.600
Which means we will now be
able to intercept intruder...

48:01.720 --> 48:03.680
while still more than
a day from Earth.

48:05.520 --> 48:07.720
Warp .8.

48:12.520 --> 48:14.600
.9.

48:21.200 --> 48:22.520
Warp 2, Sir.

48:25.240 --> 48:26.160
Warp 3.

48:29.480 --> 48:31.320
Warp 4.

48:33.720 --> 48:35.920
Warp 5.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.480
Warp 6.

48:45.880 --> 48:48.200
Warp 7.

49:02.200 --> 49:05.560
Science Officer Spock,
reporting as ordered, Captain.

49:06.640 --> 49:09.000
Please, sit down.

49:09.040 --> 49:11.440
Spock, you haven't changed a bit.

49:11.520 --> 49:14.480
You're just as warm
and sociable as ever.

49:14.520 --> 49:16.320
Nor have you, Doctor...

49:16.360 --> 49:19.760
as your continued predilection
for irrelevancy demonstrates.

49:19.880 --> 49:20.960
Gentlemen.

49:23.480 --> 49:25.920
At last report,
you were on Vulcan...

49:25.960 --> 49:27.880
apparently to stay.

49:28.520 --> 49:32.520
Yes, you were undergoing
the ''Kolanear'' discipline.

49:32.520 --> 49:33.600
Sit down.

49:33.720 --> 49:37.880
If you are referring to the
Kolinahr, Doctor, you are correct.

49:38.720 --> 49:42.640
Well, however it's pronounced,
Mr. Spock, it's the Vulcan ritual...

49:42.720 --> 49:46.080
that's supposed to purge
all remaining emotions.

49:46.120 --> 49:50.280
The Kolinahr is also a discipline
you broke to join us.

49:52.520 --> 49:57.120
Will you, please, sit down?

50:07.120 --> 50:09.760
On Vulcan I began sensing
a consciousness...

50:09.800 --> 50:13.000
from a source more powerful
than I have ever encountered.

50:13.120 --> 50:16.160
Thought patterns of
exactingly perfect order.

50:16.360 --> 50:19.160
I believe they emanate
from the intruder.

50:19.240 --> 50:22.440
I believe it may hold my answers.

50:22.480 --> 50:25.800
Isn't it lucky for you that we just
happened to be heading your way?

50:26.560 --> 50:28.400
Bones!

50:29.800 --> 50:31.640
We need him.

50:32.920 --> 50:34.320
I need him.

50:36.080 --> 50:38.840
Then my presence is
to our mutual advantage.

50:44.720 --> 50:48.120
Any thought patterns
you might sense...

50:49.440 --> 50:51.320
whether they appear to
affect you personally or not...

50:51.400 --> 50:53.520
I expect immediately reported.

50:53.600 --> 50:55.440
Of course, Captain.

50:55.520 --> 50:59.360
- Is there anything else?
- No.

51:09.920 --> 51:11.840
Jim?

51:14.600 --> 51:16.560
If this super intelligence...

51:16.680 --> 51:20.960
is as important to him as
he says it is, how do we know...

51:21.080 --> 51:23.960
That he wouldn't put his own
interests ahead of the ship's?

51:26.400 --> 51:28.320
I could never believe that.

51:28.320 --> 51:30.320
Bridge to Officers' Lounge.
Captain Kirk.

51:30.320 --> 51:33.960
Revised estimate on
cloud visual contact.:3.7minutes.

51:49.920 --> 51:51.760
Standard light, Engineer.

51:53.240 --> 51:55.320
- Full mag on viewer.
- Full mag, Sir.

52:04.520 --> 52:05.480
Lingua code?

52:05.520 --> 52:08.040
Continuing friendship messages
on all frequencies, Sir.

52:08.120 --> 52:10.440
All decks and divisions confirmed.
Status red.

52:10.480 --> 52:12.520
Captain, we are being scanned.

52:12.640 --> 52:15.400
Do not return scan, Mr. Spock.

52:15.480 --> 52:17.360
It could be misinterpreted
as hostility.

52:17.480 --> 52:20.920
Intruder scans emanating from
the exact center of the cloud.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.920
Energy of a type...

52:23.720 --> 52:25.840
never before encountered.

52:33.360 --> 52:35.240
There's no response to
friendship messages, Sir.

52:35.320 --> 52:37.160
- Shall I go to battle stations?
- Negative.

52:37.240 --> 52:38.840
We'll take
no provocative action.

52:38.920 --> 52:41.800
Recommend defensive posture,
Captain. Screens and shields.

52:43.440 --> 52:48.000
No, Mr. Decker, that could also
be misinterpreted as hostile.

52:49.480 --> 52:51.320
Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?

52:51.360 --> 52:53.560
- Twelfth-power energy field.
- Twelfth-power?

52:53.680 --> 52:56.600
We've seen what their weapons can do.
Shouldn't we take every precaution?

52:56.720 --> 52:58.120
- Mr. Decker...
- Captain.

52:59.160 --> 53:02.200
I suspect there's an object
at the heart of that cloud.

53:06.920 --> 53:10.120
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack.
If that order isn't clear enough...

53:10.200 --> 53:12.560
Captain, as your exec
it's my duty...

53:12.640 --> 53:14.080
to point out alternatives.

53:16.160 --> 53:17.560
Yes, it is.

53:18.760 --> 53:20.000
I stand corrected.

53:20.080 --> 53:21.920
Five minutes to cloud boundary.

53:22.040 --> 53:26.120
Navigator, lay in a conic section
flight path to the cloud center.

53:26.200 --> 53:29.360
Bring us parallel
to whatever we find in there.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.320
Mr. Sulu,
tactical plot on viewer.

53:31.320 --> 53:32.480
Tactical on viewer, Sir.

53:47.320 --> 53:49.560
That measures 12th-power energy?

53:51.200 --> 53:54.040
Thousands of starships
couldn't generate that much...

53:54.880 --> 53:56.640
Mr. Spock?

54:00.120 --> 54:02.000
Spock, tell me.

54:09.720 --> 54:12.040
I sense...

54:12.120 --> 54:13.480
puzzlement.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.000
We have been contacted.

54:18.200 --> 54:20.480
Why have we not replied?

54:20.520 --> 54:22.400
Contacted?

54:22.520 --> 54:24.120
How?

54:26.000 --> 54:28.200
Force fields up full.
Deflectors, now.

54:31.960 --> 54:35.040
Force fields and deflectors
up full, Captain.

54:42.080 --> 54:43.440
Analysis, Mr. Spock.

54:43.520 --> 54:46.440
Alien weapon is a form
of plasma energy, Captain.

54:46.520 --> 54:48.480
Exact composition unknown.

54:48.520 --> 54:50.640
Guidance system unknown.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.200
All decks, brace for impact.

55:05.240 --> 55:07.040
Engineering, status report.

55:07.120 --> 55:08.760
Systems overloading, Captain.

55:18.520 --> 55:19.560
Medic.

55:20.600 --> 55:22.360
Medics are coming.

55:34.160 --> 55:35.240
Engineering to Bridge.

55:35.280 --> 55:37.520
Cannot hold full power
on force fields.

55:37.600 --> 55:39.920
Deflector power
is down 70 percent.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.480
Divert auxiliary power
to deflectors.

55:46.000 --> 55:46.840
Captain.

55:48.080 --> 55:50.480
The intruder has been
attempting to communicate.

55:54.360 --> 55:56.240
I am now programming
our computer...

55:56.280 --> 55:59.840
to transmit lingua code at
their frequency and rate of speed.

55:59.920 --> 56:01.440
Commander.

56:10.400 --> 56:12.120
Spock!

56:17.600 --> 56:18.920
Here it comes.

56:19.160 --> 56:21.000
Engineering, what's happening
to our force field?

56:20.840 --> 56:23.600
Our shields cannot handle
another attack.

56:23.960 --> 56:25.320
Mr. Spock.

56:29.800 --> 56:31.640
Impact in 20 seconds

56:33.520 --> 56:34.760
Spock.

56:34.800 --> 56:36.800
Fifteen seconds.

56:36.880 --> 56:38.880
Spock, transmit now.

56:38.920 --> 56:40.280
Ten seconds.

56:41.120 --> 56:42.880
Transmitting.

56:54.200 --> 56:56.040
It would seem
our friendship messages...

56:56.120 --> 56:58.920
have been received
and understood, Mr. Spock.

56:58.920 --> 57:01.680
I would say that was
a logical assumption, Captain.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.760
Mr. Sulu, hold present position.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.520
Holding present position, Sir.

57:14.520 --> 57:16.520
Tactical plot on viewer.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.480
Course projection
on tactical, Sir.

57:24.120 --> 57:25.720
Opinion, Mr. Spock.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.560
Recommend we proceed, Captain.

57:28.280 --> 57:31.320
- Mr. Decker?
- I advise caution, Captain.

57:31.360 --> 57:33.360
We can't withstand another attack.

57:33.480 --> 57:35.560
That thing is 20 hours
away from Earth.

57:35.600 --> 57:38.600
- We know nothing about it as yet.
- Precisely the point, Captain.

57:38.720 --> 57:40.560
We don't know what it'll do.

57:40.600 --> 57:43.200
Moving into that cloud
at this time...

57:43.280 --> 57:44.760
is an unwarranted gamble.

57:46.200 --> 57:48.520
How do you define ''unwarranted''?

57:51.520 --> 57:53.360
You asked my opinion, Sir.

58:00.800 --> 58:02.720
Viewer. Standard ahead.

58:11.720 --> 58:13.080
Navigator, maintain course.

58:13.120 --> 58:14.480
Helmsman...

58:15.440 --> 58:17.240
steady as she goes.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:28.400
No vessel could generate
a power field of this magnitude.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.600
Spock.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.400
Instruments fluctuating,
Captain.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.840
Patterns unrecognizable.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.680
Transmit image of alien to Starfleet.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:23.960
Advise we are attempting
further communication.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.920
Unable to make contact
with Starfleet, Captain.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.120
Any attempt to transmit out of
the cloud is being reflected back.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:42.120
We are closing on it
rapidly, Captain.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.920
Reduce magnification
factor four, Mr. Sulu.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.240
We are already
two settings below that, Sir.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.160
Mr. Sulu...

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.280
bring us into
a parallel course...

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.160
over the alien...

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.480
at 500 meters.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.120
Five hundred meters?

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.920
Then take us out
to 100 kilometers distance...

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.720
adjusting parallel course.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.200
Aye, Sir.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.000
Viewer astern.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.280
Reverse angle on the view,
Captain.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.480
Five hundred meters.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.320
Viewer ahead, Sir.

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.960
Hold relative position here.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.960
Mr. Spock!

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.600
Can that be one of their crew?

01:08:48.439 --> 01:08:50.680
A probe from their vessel,
Captain.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.520
Plasma-energy combination.

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:56.880
Don't interfere with it.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:59.760
Absolutely, I will not interfere.

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.080
No one interfere.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.960
It doesn't seem interested in us.
Only the ship.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.160
Computer off.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.120
It's taking control
of the computer.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.240
It's running our records...
Earth defenses, Starfleet strength.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.680
Ilia!

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.680
Ilia!

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.280
This is how I define ''unwarranted.''

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.680
Activate auxiliary computer circuits
through manual shutoff.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.400
Captain, we've been
seized by a tractor beam.

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.560
Get someone up here
to take the navigator's station.

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.400
- Engineering.
- Chief DiFalco, to the bridge.

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:35.600
- Emergency power.
- Going to full emergency.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:40.800
But, Captain, if we don't break free
in 15 seconds, she'll burn up.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.720
We cannot break free, Captain.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.840
We have only a fraction
of the power necessary.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:47.040
Engineering, belay that order.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.960
Disengage all main drive systems.

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.240
Chief DiFalco,
take over Lieutenant Ilia's station.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.600
DiFalco, disengage engine
navigation relays now.

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:19.760
Aye, Sir.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.680
Force field circuits
E-10 through 14...

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.320
show ready for reactivation.

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.720
Confirm, please.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.160
Scotty, drive systems
should be free now.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.280
Commander?

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.200
Ready to launch
remote communications drone...

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.600
with complete ship's records...

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.520
including
our present situation, Sir.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.480
Delay launching
as long as possible.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.120
Our drone can't escape as long
as we're held in their tractor.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.080
Aye.

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.800
Captain, a maximum phaser strike
directly at the beam...

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.920
might weaken it just enough
for us to break free.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.840
Break free to where, Commander?

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.680
Any show of resistance
would be futile, Captain.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.720
We don't know that, Mr. Spock.
Why are you opposed to trying?

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:11.240
Why bring us inside?

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.560
Not to destroy us.
They could have done that outside.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.360
They still can.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.440
Curiosity, Mr. Decker.

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.560
Insatiable curiosity.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:34.800
Captain, photic sonar readings
indicate the aperture is closing.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.440
We're trapped, Sir.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:39.320
Reverse angle on the viewer,
Captain.

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:06.480
Tractor beam has released us,
Captain.

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:09.160
Confirmed.
Vessel is floating free.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.120
No forward momentum.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.320
Viewer ahead.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.720
Viewer ahead, Sir.

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:24.200
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Ahead one third.

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.400
Thrusters ahead one third.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.920
Let's take a look.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.240
Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.520
They can't expect us
not to look them over now.

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.440
Now that we're
looking down their throat.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.480
Right, now that we've got them
just where they want us.

01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.520
It's closing up.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.240
Hold position.

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:09.840
Captain.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:16.080
All our scans
are being reflected back.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.560
Sensors are useless.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:20.040
Damn.

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.040
What do you make of all this?

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.040
I believe the closed orifice
leads to another chamber...

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.720
undoubtedly part of
the vessel's inner mechanism.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.320
I suspect it may be necess...

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.520
Intruder alert!
Deck 5. Officer's quarters.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.240
Have Security meet me
at deck 5, main elevator.

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.560
Spock.
Mr. Decker, you have the com.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.160
Hold positions.

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.160
You are the Kirk unit.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.080
You will assist me.

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:20.960
I have been programmed by V'Ger...

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.560
to observe and record...

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.480
normal functions
of the carbon-based units...

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.720
infesting USS Enterprise.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:43.320
-Jim, what's going on?
- Tricorder.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.520
Who is...

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.200
V'Ger?

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:53.520
V'Ger is that which programmed me.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:59.040
Is V'Ger the name of the Captain
of the alien vessel?

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.400
Jim.

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.240
This is a mechanism.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.840
A probe, Captain.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:08.160
No doubt
a sensor-transceiver combination...

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.640
recording everything we say and do.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:13.000
Where is Lieutenant Ilia?

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.560
That unit no longer functions.

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.440
I've been given its form...

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.360
to more readily communicate
with the carbon-based units...

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.360
infesting Enterprise.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.360
Carbon-based units?

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:27.600
Humans, Ensign Perez.
Us.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.560
Why does V'Ger travel...

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:33.600
to the third planet of the solar
system directly ahead?

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.800
To find the creator.

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.200
Find the creator?

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:40.840
Whose...

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.720
What does V'Ger want
with the creator?

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.160
To join with him.

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:51.440
To join with the creator? How?

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:54.040
V'Ger and the creator
will become one.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.840
And who is the creator?

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:58.360
The creator is that
which created V'Ger.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.440
Who is V'Ger?

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:02.160
V'Ger is that
which seeks the creator.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:09.280
I'm ready to commence
my observations.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:12.200
Doctor, a thorough examination
of this probe...

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.720
might provide some insight
into those who manufactured it...

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.920
and how to deal with them.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.800
Fine.
Let's get her to sick bay.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.120
I'm programmed
to observe and record...

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.720
only the normal functioning
of the carbon-based units.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.880
The, uh...

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:33.000
examination is a normal function.

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.200
You may proceed.

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.560
Micro-miniature hydraulics...

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.080
sensors...

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:57.000
and molecule-sized
multiprocessor chips.

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.200
And take a look at this.

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.880
An osmotic micropump, right here.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:09.960
Even the smallest body functions
are exactly duplicated.

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:15.960
Every exocrine system
is the same, too...

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:18.480
even eye moisture.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.680
Decker.

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.600
Fascinating.

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.680
Not ''Decker unit.''

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:31.520
Gentlemen.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:32.960
Will.

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.360
- What happened to her?
- Captain.

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.680
This probe may be our key
to the aliens.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:50.600
- Probe? Ilia?
- Exactly.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.800
It is a programmed mechanism,
Commander.

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:56.400
Its body duplicates our navigator
in precise detail.

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.640
Suppose that,
beneath its programming...

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.280
the real Ilia's memory patterns
are duplicated with equal precision.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.640
- They had a pattern to follow.
- Indeed.

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.320
They may have followed it
too precisely.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.320
Ilia's memory...

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.920
her feelings of loyalty,
obedience, friendship...

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.840
might all be there.

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:18.800
You did have a relationship
with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.440
That probe, in another form,
is what killed Ilia.

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.240
Commander...

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.680
Will, we're locked
in an alien vessel...

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.160
six hours from Earth's orbit.

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.640
Our only contact with our captor
is that probe.

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:31.880
If we can control it,
persuade it, use it...

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:37.360
I have recorded enough here.

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.320
You will now assist me further.

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.240
The, uh...

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:47.120
Decker unit can assist you
with much greater efficiency.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.120
Carry on with your assignment,
Mr. Decker.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.800
Aye, Sir.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:05.440
I am concerned with that being our
only source of information, Captain.

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:12.600
Captain's Log:
Stardate 7414.1.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:16.360
Our best estimates place us
some four hours from Earth.

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.360
No significant progress
thus far...

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:22.240
reviving Ilia memory patterns
within the alien probe.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:26.000
This remains our only means
of contact with our captor.

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:28.400
All those vessels
were called Enterprise.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.400
The carbon units
use this area for recreation.

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.320
This is one of the games.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.360
What types of recreation does
the crew aboard your vessel enjoy?

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.400
The words ''recreation''...

01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.840
and ''enjoy''...

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:02.240
have no meaning
to my programming.

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:11.920
Ilia enjoyed this game.

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.760
She nearly always won.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:24.400
Good. He's using
audiovisual association.

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:01.280
This device serves no purpose.

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:16.640
Why does Enterprise require
the presence of carbon units?

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:19.520
Enterprise would be unable
to function without carbon units.

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.760
More data concerning
this functioning is necessary...

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.120
before carbon units
can be patterned...

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:28.040
for data storage.

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.040
What does that mean?

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:36.200
When my examination is complete...

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:39.760
all carbon units will be
reduced to data patterns.

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.280
Within you...

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.360
are the memory patterns
of a certain carbon unit.

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:48.360
If I can help you
to revive those patterns...

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.280
you could understand
our functions better.

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.320
That is logical.

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.120
You may proceed.

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:42.480
I remember Lieutenant Ilia
once mentioning she wore that.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:50.000
On Delta.

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.520
Remember?

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:52.800
Ilia.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.080
Dr. Chapel.

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.320
Will?

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.560
Ilia.

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.040
Commander.

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:20.400
Commander.

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:23.880
This is a mechanism.

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.080
Ilia...

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.840
help us make direct contact
with V'Ger.

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:35.760
I cannot.

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:41.400
This creator V'Ger is looking for...
what is it?

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:44.800
V'Ger does not know.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:14.480
Computer, commence recording.

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:18.760
Captain Kirk, these messages
will detail my attempt...

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.800
to contact the aliens.

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:51.440
I intend to calculate thruster
ignition and acceleration rate...

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:53.760
to coincide with the opening
of the V'Ger orifice.

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.680
This should facilitate
a better view...

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.600
of the interior
of the alien spacecraft.

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:06.360
Captain, Starfleet signals
are growing in strength, Sir.

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.640
They still have the intruder
on their monitors.

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.880
- It's decelerating.
- Confirmed, Sir.

01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:14.360
Lunar beacons indicate intruder
on a course into Earth orbit.

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:17.640
Sir, air lock 4
has been opened.

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:20.200
A thruster suit
is reported missing.

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:23.880
A thruster suit?

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.320
That's Spock.

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:29.200
Damn him.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.880
Bring him back here.

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.320
No, wait.

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:42.240
- Get a fix on his position.
- Aye, Sir.

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.880
I have successfully penetrated...

01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.840
the next chamber
of the alien's interior...

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.880
and I'm witnessing
some sort of dimensional image...

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:05.320
which I believe to be
a representation...

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:07.080
of V'Ger's home planet.

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.480
I'm passing through
a connecting tunnel.

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:19.640
Apparently, a kind of
plasma-energy conduit.

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:23.360
Possibly a field coil for
a gigantic imaging system.

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:35.160
Curious.

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.680
I'm seeing images
of planets, moons, stars...

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:41.440
whole galaxies
all stored here, recorded.

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:44.320
It could be a representation
of V'Ger's entire journey.

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.240
But who or what...

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.600
are we dealing with?

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:57.720
The Epsilon 9 station,
stored here with every detail.

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.400
Captain, I am now
quite convinced...

01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:09.560
that all of this is V'Ger...

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:12.360
that we are inside
a living machine.

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:18.840
Ilia.

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:25.880
The sensor...

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.480
must contain
some special meaning.

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.880
I must try to mind-meld with it.

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:26.480
Spock.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.800
Spock!

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.400
Spock.

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:50.200
Now scanning pons area
at spinal nerve fiber connection.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:57.080
Indications of some
neurological trauma.

01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:00.520
The power pouring through that
mind-meld must have been staggering.

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:08.720
Spock.

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.200
Jim.

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:15.120
I should have known.

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.320
Were you right...

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:18.520
about V'Ger?

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:22.640
A life-form of its own.

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:25.280
A conscious, living entity.

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.680
A living machine?

01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:28.600
It considers the Enterprise
a living machine.

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:30.840
That's why the probe
refers to our ship as an entity.

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.960
I saw V'Ger's planet.

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:37.600
A planet populated
by living machines.

01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.680
Unbelievable technology.

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:45.320
V'Ger has knowledge
that spans this universe.

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:48.720
And yet...

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:51.040
with all its pure logic...

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.880
V'Ger is barren...

01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:55.200
cold.

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:56.400
No mystery.

01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:58.800
No beauty.

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:05.600
Should have known.

01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:08.600
Known?

01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:11.360
Known what? Spock.

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.880
What should you have known?
What should you have known?

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.200
Jim...

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:34.880
this...

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.800
simple feeling...

01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.920
is beyond V'Ger's comprehension.

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:51.440
No meaning, no hope.

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.160
Jim...

01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:57.360
no answers.

01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:00.400
It's asking questions.

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:04.120
''Is this...

01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:06.320
all that I am?

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.960
Is there nothing more?''

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:16.400
Bridge to Captain.

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:20.640
Kirk here.

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:23.400
A faint signal
from Starfleet, Sir.

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:26.280
Intruder cloud has been located
on their outer monitors...

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.360
for the past 27 minutes.

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:31.840
Cloud dissipating rapidly
as it approaches.

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:35.520
Starfleet reports forward velocity
has slowed to sub-warp speed.

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:37.440
We are three minutes
from Earth orbit.

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.360
I'll be right there.

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:45.040
I need Spock on the bridge.

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:47.120
Dalaphaline, five cc's.

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:50.960
A machine planet...

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:53.920
sending a machine to Earth..

01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:57.520
looking for its creator.

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:02.560
It's absolutely incredible.

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:09.240
Mr. Chekov.
Commander Decker present location.

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:11.520
They are in the engineering, Sir.

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:24.960
Captain, Starfleet is sending
this tactical on V'Ger's position.

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:29.040
V'Ger is transmitting... a signal.

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:32.920
Jim.

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.720
From V'Ger.

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:42.360
V'Ger signals the creator.

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:56.600
Spock?

01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:00.400
A simple binary code...

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:03.120
transmitted by carrier wave signal.

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:05.800
Radio.

01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:08.800
Radio?

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:15.320
Jim.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:18.040
V'Ger expects an answer.

01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:20.360
An answer?

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:22.280
I don't know the question.

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:25.400
The creator has not responded.

01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:42.800
All planetary defense systems
have just gone inoperative.

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:24.920
Sir, Starfleet computes
the devices are proceeding...

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:28.080
toward equidistant positions
orbiting the planet.

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:29.800
They're the same things
that hit us.

01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:32.600
They are hundreds of times
more powerful, Captain.

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.880
From those positions...

01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:36.440
they could devastate
the entire surface of the planet.

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:50.640
Why?

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.920
The creator has not answered.

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:56.680
The carbon unit infestation is to be
removed from the creator's planet.

01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:57.640
Why?

01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:00.640
You infest Enterprise.

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:03.240
You interfere with the creator
in the same manner.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
V'Ger

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
V'Ger

01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:24.800
Captain.

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:31.520
V'Ger is a child.

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.360
I suggest you treat it as such.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.160
- A child?
- Yes, Captain.

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:38.040
A child...

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:41.400
evolving, learning, searching...

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.720
instinctively needing.

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.760
- Needing what?
- Spock.

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:51.160
This child is about to wipe out
every living thing on Earth.

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:54.080
Now, what do you suggest we do?
Spank it?

01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:59.560
It knows only that it needs,
Commander.

01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:03.200
But, like so many of us...

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.200
it does not know what.

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:21.600
The carbon units know why
the creator has not responded.

01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.680
Disclose the information.

01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:30.560
Not until V'Ger withdraws the
devices orbiting the third planet.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:32.240
Captain.

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.360
I'm losing Starfleet.

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:38.680
Interference from V'Ger.

01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:42.480
Kirk unit, disclose the information.

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.280
Why has the creator not responded?

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:47.400
No.

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:52.720
Secure all stations.

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:54.200
Clear the bridge.

01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:59.240
Clear the bridge, Captain?

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:01.280
- That was the order, Mr. Sulu.
- Clear the bridge  - Aye, Sir.

01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:12.480
Your child is having a tantrum,
Mr. Spock.

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:16.080
V'Ger requires the information.

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:22.240
Bridge, secure all stations.
Move out.

01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:24.920
Jim, what the hell
kind of strategy is this?

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.560
All ship's functions
going to automatic, Captain.

01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:30.240
If V'Ger destroys the Enterprise...

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:32.600
the information that V'Ger requires
will also be destroyed.

01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:35.640
It is illogical to withhold
required information.

01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:38.160
Kirk unit!

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:39.400
Kirk unit.

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:44.600
Why do you not
disclose information?

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:51.800
Because V'Ger's going to destroy all
carbon units on the third planet.

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:53.720
They have repressed the creator.

01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:56.360
The information
will not be disclosed.

01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:59.320
V'Ger needs the information.

01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:04.320
Then V'Ger must withdraw
all the orbiting devices.

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:06.880
V'Ger will comply...

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:09.760
if the carbon units will
disclose the information.

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:17.960
It learns fast, doesn't it?

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:21.280
Captain, the vessel... V'Ger...

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:25.040
obviously operates from
a central brain complex.

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:27.840
The orbiting devices would be
controlled from that point, then.

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.320
Precisely.

01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:42.440
The carbon unit's information cannot
be disclosed to V'Ger's probe...

01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:45.320
but only to V'Ger directly.

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:09.680
Forward motion, Captain.

01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:10.960
Tractor beam.

01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:30.480
Captain, what's the next move?

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:34.240
The question is, Mr. Decker...

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:36.200
is there a next move?

01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:40.680
Resume duty stations.

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.680
All personnel, resume stations.

01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:52.920
Well, Mr. Decker,
it seems my bluff has been called.

01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:57.280
I'm afraid our hand
is pretty weak, Captain.

01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:04.680
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices
reach final position?

01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:08.080
Twenty-seven minutes. Mark.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.920
Captain, I believe
that is our destination.

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.520
Forward motion slowing, Captain.

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:32.080
I read an oxygen-gravity envelope
forming outside the Enterprise.

01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:42.800
Forward motion stopped, Captain.

01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:48.440
V'Ger.

01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:52.480
Sir, I've located the source
of V'Ger's radio signal.

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:53.920
It's directly ahead.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:58.120
That transmitter is a vital link
between V'Ger and its creator.

01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:04.320
The carbon units
will now provide V'Ger...

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.600
with the required information.

01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:14.920
Mr. Spock. Bones.

01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:22.360
Mr. Decker, I will contact you
every five minutes.

01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:24.640
Captain.

01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:27.520
I'd like to go along.

01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:32.920
Mr. Sulu, you have the com.

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:24.800
V'Ger.

01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:37.600
''V... G-E-R.''

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:41.600
V'Ger.

01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:57.400
''V-O-Y-A-G-E-R.''

01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:58.680
Voyager.

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:04.600
Voyager 6.

01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:08.840
NASA. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:10.760
Jim...

01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:13.320
this was launched
more than 300 years ago.

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:18.680
Voyager series.

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:22.200
Designed to collect data...

01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:27.080
and transmit it back to Earth.

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:08.360
Captain...

01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:13.120
Voyager 6 disappeared into what
they used to call a black hole.

01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:16.000
It must have emerged
on the far side of the galaxy...

01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:20.120
and fell into the machine planet's
gravitational field.

01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:23.560
The machine inhabitants found it
to be one of their own kind...

01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:26.040
primitive, yet kindred.

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:28.960
They discovered its simple
20th-century programming...

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.360
collect all data possible.

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.400
Learn all that is learnable.

01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:38.960
Return that information
to its creator.

01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:40.400
Precisely, Mr. Decker.

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.640
The machines
interpreted it literally.

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:45.600
They built this entire vessel...

01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:49.080
so that Voyager could actually
fulfill its programming.

01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:51.040
And on its journey back...

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.360
it amassed so much knowledge...

01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:59.040
it achieved consciousness itself.

01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:02.560
It became a living thing.

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:18.160
Kirk unit.

01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:20.160
V'Ger awaits the information.

01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:23.040
Enterprise...

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:26.480
order up the ship's
computer library records...

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:29.880
on the late 20th-century
NASA probe Voyager 6.

01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:32.640
Specifically, we want
the old NASA code signal...

01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:34.720
that instructs the probe
to transmit its data.

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:36.800
- And fast, Uhura, fast.
-Aye, Sir.

01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:38.840
That's what it's been signaling...

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:41.200
its readiness
to transmit its information.

01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:43.120
And there's no one on Earth...

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:45.400
who could recognize the old signal
and send a response.

01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:47.520
The creator does not answer.

01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:58.960
V'Ger.

01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:05.920
V'Ger.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.400
V'Ger!

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:16.480
We are the creator.

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.400
That is not logical.

01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:20.320
Carbon units
are not true life-forms.

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.600
We will prove it.

01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:25.800
We will make it possible for you
to complete your programming.

01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:28.200
Only the creator
could accomplish that.

01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:31.360
Enterprise?

01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:34.320
We have just received
the response code, Captain.

01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:36.760
Set the Enterprise transmitter
on appropriate frequency...

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:39.040
and transmit the code now.

01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:40.320
Transmitting.

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:43.600
5-0-4...

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:45.680
3-2-9...

01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:47.600
3-1-7...

01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:50.000
5-1-0...

01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:52.640
and the final sequence.

01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:55.040
That should trigger
Voyager's transmitter.

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:10.280
Voyager is not transmitting
its data, Captain.

01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:14.440
The creator must join with V'Ger.

01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:19.600
Uhura, repeat the final sequence.

01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:26.520
The creator must join with V'Ger.

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:48.640
Voyager is not transmitting,
Captain...

01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:51.160
because it did not receive
the final sequence.

01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:53.800
Jim, we're down to ten minutes.

01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:55.720
Enterprise, stand by.

01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:07.680
- The antenna leads are melted away.
- Yes, Captain, just now.

01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:10.080
By V'Ger itself.

01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:13.120
- Why?
- To prevent reception.

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:14.560
Of course.

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:17.280
To bring the creator here.

01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:19.840
To finish transmitting
the code in person.

01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:24.800
To touch the creator.

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:27.560
Capture God?

01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:32.240
V'Ger's liable to be in for
one hell of a disappointment.

01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:34.400
Perhaps not, Doctor.

01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:58.760
Captain.

01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:06.360
V'Ger must evolve.

01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:10.280
Its knowledge has reached the limits
of this universe. It must evolve.

01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:13.320
What it requires of its god, Doctor,
is the answer to its question...

01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:14.920
Is there nothing more?

01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:17.680
What more is there
than the universe, Spock?

01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:19.640
Other dimensions.
Higher levels of being.

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:21.960
The existence of which
cannot be proven logically.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.320
Therefore, V'Ger is incapable
of believing in them.

01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:27.840
What V'Ger needs
in order to evolve...

01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:30.120
is a human quality...

01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:32.080
our capacity to leap beyond logic.

01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:38.840
Joining with its creator
might accomplish that.

01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:41.800
You mean this machine wants to
physically join with a human?

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:44.360
Is that possible?

01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:48.920
Let's find out.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.320
Decker.

01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:01.320
I'm gonna key the final sequence
through the ground test computer.

01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:03.280
You don't know
what that'll do to you!

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.800
Yes, I do, Doctor.

01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:13.000
Decker, don't.

01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:15.800
Jim, I want this.

01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:20.080
As much as you wanted
the Enterprise, I want this.

01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:07.680
Captain.

01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:13.560
Spock, did we just see the beginning
of a new life-form?

01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:16.800
Yes, Captain.
We witnessed a birth.

01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:19.440
Possibly a next step
in our evolution.

01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:21.160
I wonder.

01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:24.040
Well, it's been a long time
since I delivered a baby.

01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:26.000
I hope we got this one off
to a good start.

01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:28.520
I hope so too.

01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:32.520
I think we gave it the ability to
create its own sense of purpose...

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.360
out of our own human weaknesses...

01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:40.000
and the drive that compels us
to overcome them.

01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:43.800
And a lot of foolish human emotions.
Right, Mr. Spock?

01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:45.560
Quite true, Doctor.

01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:49.040
Unfortunately, it will have to
deal with them as well.

01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:50.960
Interrogative from Starfleet.

01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:54.560
They're requesting damage and injury
reports and complete vessel status.

01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:56.360
Report two casualties.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.680
Lieutenant Ilia.

01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:01.240
Captain Decker.

02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:02.720
- Aye, Sir.
- Correction.

02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:04.600
They're not casualties.

02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:06.040
They...

02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:11.480
List them as missing.

02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:13.520
Vessel status: fully operational.

02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:15.560
Aye, Sir.

02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:19.320
Mr. Scott, shall we give
the Enterprise a proper shakedown?

02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:23.240
I would say it's time
for that, Sir, aye.

02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:26.280
We can have you back on Vulcan
in four days, Mr. Spock.

02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.680
Unnecessary, Mr. Scott.

02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:31.120
My task on Vulcan is completed.

02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:34.800
Mr. Sulu, ahead warp 1 .

02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:37.200
- Warp 1 , Sir.
- Heading, Sir?

02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:43.040
Out there.

02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:46.480
That away.
