00:12.769 --> 00:46.445
âª

00:46.445 --> 00:50.730
Stuff your muffins and slam your
scones, zoners. It's time for a PWN ZWN brunch break.

00:50.730 --> 00:53.813
Brought to you by Brunchables, Brunch Crunch Cereal.

00:53.813 --> 00:57.059
Whether for breakfast or lunch, munch on a
bunch of Brunch Crunch!

00:57.059 --> 00:59.108
Brunchables. Brunch up your brunch!

00:59.108 --> 01:02.712
Our top story: Crunch went Brian D's underdog dreams,

01:02.712 --> 01:07.066
as the one shot wonder of VGHS was completely o'bruncherated

01:07.066 --> 01:09.731
in yesterday's FPS scrimmage by The Law.

01:09.731 --> 01:15.306
Peep this replay of him going "eggs Benedict Arnold" on teammate Jenny Matrix.

01:30.629 --> 01:36.837
Brian, check it. Ki invented a brunch of
pizza. She calls it, get this, a "quiche".

01:36.837 --> 01:39.168
I already told you, it was just a coincidence!

01:39.168 --> 01:41.439
Isn't she amazing, dude?

01:41.439 --> 01:46.506
You guys are great together.
You would never betray one another.

01:46.506 --> 01:51.568
Oh, man, I suck. You're still beaten up over that Jenny Matrix thing?

01:51.568 --> 01:54.325
Nah. Laughs. I'm over it.

01:54.340 --> 01:58.468
That's the 'tude, dude. It's a new day. Carpe Diem.

02:00.406 --> 02:02.631
Carpe Diem.

02:03.662 --> 02:05.681
Carpe Diem.

02:09.496 --> 02:11.215
Let's get to class.

02:17.353 --> 02:21.543
That last pun felt a little half baked, shot bot. But one thing's for sure:

02:21.543 --> 02:27.878
Any way you slice this melon, Brian D's chances of making JV at tryouts are over, easy.

02:27.878 --> 02:31.862
I'm Scott Slanders, and I'm drunk.

02:48.234 --> 02:52.142
Ki, that's...a 4000 hit combo

02:57.443 --> 03:00.192
I helped my parents design this game.

03:00.761 --> 03:01.818
Let's play again.

03:01.818 --> 03:04.308
No no no! I've had..I've had quite enough.

03:04.308 --> 03:07.848
You already made me quite the Brian D. [Laughter.]

03:10.725 --> 03:12.931
Let's play again.

03:16.030 --> 03:23.243
Brian D? More like Brian Z. The last letter in the alphabet. Oooh! Yeah!

03:23.243 --> 03:25.607
Don't even listen to him, dude.

03:25.607 --> 03:29.523
Ted, please, I don't even.know what that means.

03:29.523 --> 03:34.236
Well Z is the la... You know I don't even have time to explain to you how sick of a burn that was --

03:39.673 --> 03:43.187
Ted? Ted!

03:43.187 --> 03:44.470
What happened?

03:44.470 --> 03:46.966
You okay? You passed out for like 27 minutes!

03:46.966 --> 03:50.337
I'm fine. I just...

03:50.337 --> 03:52.662
You've seen them haven't you, Theodore?

03:52.677 --> 03:54.865
Hi Drift King.

03:54.865 --> 03:57.169
The visions. What are they?

03:57.169 --> 04:02.318
Merely a side effect...of drift fever!

04:02.318 --> 04:05.400
You've got the blood, Ted! You can't escape this now!

04:05.400 --> 04:11.316
Cast off that silly little plastic guitar, and grip the steering wheel of destiny!

04:11.316 --> 04:14.565
Forget it DK. Us Wongs are bred to shred.

04:14.565 --> 04:16.982
I'm signing up for rythm gaming and there's nothing you can do to stop me!

04:16.982 --> 04:22.071
Confound it! Why must you Brian D your future away on this dying sport?

04:22.071 --> 04:24.342
Look at me in the eye.

04:24.342 --> 04:32.121
Tell me that hammer-ons and pull-ups can possibly compare to the G force pull of an A+J turn?

04:33.065 --> 04:37.922
The thrum of a rumble chair as you careen past the checkered flag.

04:37.922 --> 04:43.451
The churning in your chest as you hear those three magical words:

04:43.451 --> 04:48.417
NEW LAP RECORD!

04:51.340 --> 04:54.309
Got .. a class, I gotta go to class. Yoga class. Let's go!

04:54.309 --> 04:57.117
That's on thursday.
I don't care. Let's go.

04:57.132 --> 04:59.945
Okay!

04:59.945 --> 05:05.165
Ted, even a man as fast as you can't run away from himself forever!

05:07.334 --> 05:09.588
Hey buddy, look, I got you ...uh.

05:09.588 --> 05:15.279
Ah, my thanks Ted's vassal. Though in the future, I prefer, sour cream and onions.

05:15.279 --> 05:17.908
Who are you? [Shrieks]

05:44.517 --> 05:46.977
Hey there, champ. How are you holding up?

05:46.977 --> 05:50.566
Great, great, yeah totally great.

05:50.566 --> 05:54.617
Yeah, this is nothing compared to our old school. Those guys really knew how to haze.

05:54.617 --> 05:59.713
Really? Well, I guess we'll just have to step it up a notch then.

05:59.713 --> 06:03.372
JK, I'm just rattling you, bro! [Fakes a laugh]

06:04.911 --> 06:07.209
So...you good?

06:07.209 --> 06:12.662
Good? Yeah, No, I'm great, you know, it's totally great.

06:12.662 --> 06:16.190
You're great, I'm great, you're with the Law, that's great, by the way.

06:16.190 --> 06:22.425
I'm by myself, but that's great. [Chuckles] Yeah, no, everything is great.

06:22.471 --> 06:28.660
Good. I have to go set up for practice. But...I'm glad that you're...

06:28.660 --> 06:31.150
...doing great! Okay.

06:33.730 --> 06:36.710
I'll catch you later, babe.

06:38.864 --> 06:40.197
I really am d.. Aah! Ooh!

06:44.160 --> 06:47.391
Brian D! My office! Now!

06:52.103 --> 06:55.741
The school took a risk on you, Brian.

06:55.741 --> 07:00.470
You let us down. Have a seat, kid.

07:02.208 --> 07:08.263
Sir. Sir, I know I screwed up at scrimmage. But I figure with try-outs still right around the corner --

07:08.279 --> 07:12.049
VGHS try-outs are streamed across the world.

07:12.049 --> 07:14.294
And you're one point away from expulsion.

07:14.294 --> 07:16.981
Administration doesn't like those odds.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.614
So what are you saying?

07:20.614 --> 07:23.128
I'm saying you're circling the drain.

07:23.128 --> 07:26.536
We don't need some kid Brian D-ing all over our reputation.

07:26.536 --> 07:31.856
That new catchphrase is the exact reason why administration is asking you to ragequit on your own accord.

07:34.012 --> 07:39.898
We're asking you to - that's a good coffee - we're asking you...

07:39.929 --> 07:42.230
to leave VGHS.

07:52.659 --> 07:54.740
Hey! Kick back the hover ball!

08:25.907 --> 08:27.882
Tough day, Brian?

08:28.711 --> 08:31.776
Oh hey, Games! What do you want?

08:31.776 --> 08:34.910
Just wondering if you dropped this.

08:34.910 --> 08:36.870
How did you get that?

08:36.900 --> 08:38.604
Well it's a funny story.

08:38.620 --> 08:43.727
I told you. Stick to Games. I'm totally a catch.

08:43.727 --> 08:46.042
That's my favorite game!

08:46.042 --> 08:50.442
No baby. That's our favorite game.

08:55.427 --> 08:57.395
Great. Well, enjoy the game.

08:57.395 --> 09:00.761
Oh I will. But not as much as Jenny will enjoy your cute little:

09:00.761 --> 09:06.261
[Mimicking in a weak voice] "Oh, I like you, but I don't have the balls to say so" note. Or per chance, the Law will succumb to your...

09:06.261 --> 09:09.104
..."Don Juan-tay" marksmanship.

09:10.827 --> 09:12.302
Are you kidding me?

09:12.302 --> 09:13.151
This place is ridiculous!

09:13.151 --> 09:18.473
It's my time in the spotlight, Brian! And you're standing in my way.

09:18.473 --> 09:19.968
It's Game's time.

09:19.968 --> 09:27.465
Whoa-hoa-hoa! [Laughs] It's Game's time! That's cute. You got yourself a little brand. I like that. [Laughs]

09:27.526 --> 09:30.337
You know what, Games? You want the spotlight?

09:30.337 --> 09:33.175
You can have it! But first here's what we're gonna do.

09:33.175 --> 09:36.074
Alright, we're going to throw it down. I'm gonna stomp your face.

09:36.074 --> 09:41.580
I'm gonna make you cry, in front of your two...stupid friends whose names I don't even wanna know.

09:41.596 --> 09:45.673
You see Games, I'm one point away from expulsion.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.873
And I'm gonna use that point on all 3 of you noobs.

09:49.873 --> 09:52.737
I figured you'd say something like that.

09:55.648 --> 09:59.011
Assault rifles?
Ahh, let's get an SMG in there.

09:59.011 --> 10:01.144
You funeral. Best of three?

10:01.144 --> 10:03.551
First to five!
Game's on.

10:44.307 --> 10:46.429
Oh, hoa, hoa, hoa. See ya!

11:01.935 --> 11:04.427
I'm destroying you!

11:19.777 --> 11:22.833
What are you doing here?
Saving your ass.

11:27.284 --> 11:32.463
Yeah, well, it's a little late for that.

11:45.137 --> 11:49.172
Dammit, Brian! What the Hell are you doing?

11:49.172 --> 11:50.575
I'm leaving on my own accord.

11:50.575 --> 11:55.492
Yeah, I set you up. But you know what? You wanted to be in that game, and you screwed it up.

11:55.492 --> 11:58.139
So you can blame me. You can blame the whole damn school.

11:58.139 --> 12:04.994
But right here, right now, it is all on you.

12:11.425 --> 12:13.283
Let's dance.

13:23.425 --> 13:28.805
But...but it was Games' time!

13:28.805 --> 13:33.500
This isn't over Brian D. Cronies, let's roll.

13:39.704 --> 13:42.037
Thanks for the assist.

13:42.037 --> 13:48.986
Um, yeah, you're welcome. You should play like that more often.

13:52.785 --> 13:56.570
See you at sign-ups tomorrow.

13:56.570 --> 14:01.481
You can kiss your high scores, good bye!

14:01.496 --> 14:05.224
Yeah, good luck with that captain.

14:06.985 --> 14:09.464
Hey, Jenny, thanks for giving me a shot.

14:09.464 --> 14:15.534
And no matter how cool your are, better practice those 5-star songs if you plan on taking me on. Brian.
