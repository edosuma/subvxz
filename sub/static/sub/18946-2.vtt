00:22.460 --> 00:25.458
Oh, are you and Toby still OK
for our tapas night next week?

00:25.460 --> 00:27.338
Yes, looking forward to it.

00:27.339 --> 00:28.939
Oh, and talking of nights out,

00:28.940 --> 00:31.658
last week, Toby and I paid a small fortune

00:31.660 --> 00:33.698
for tickets to the ballet, and sod's law,

00:33.700 --> 00:36.499
the morning after we saw it,
one of Toby's rich patients

00:36.500 --> 00:38.978
gave him tickets to the exact
same ballet as a gift.

00:38.979 --> 00:41.259
You know what it's like when
these things happen.

00:41.259 --> 00:42.420
Yeah.

00:43.939 --> 00:46.219
Like that time I bought
the box set of Touch Of Frost

00:46.219 --> 00:48.539
and then they go and repeat it all on ITV2.

00:49.899 --> 00:50.978
Right.

00:50.979 --> 00:53.378
Well... it's tomorrow night.

00:53.380 --> 00:55.459
The tickets are yours, if you'd like them.

00:55.460 --> 00:57.459
Oh, wow! Thanks, Anna. That's amazing.

00:57.460 --> 01:01.698
You don't think it will be a bit
of a culture shock for Lee?

01:01.700 --> 01:03.939
Any culture comes as a shock to Lee.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.899
As much I'd like to see the look on Lee's face,

01:06.900 --> 01:09.138
I really do have to dash. See you soon.

01:09.140 --> 01:11.218
OK, bye. Thanks, Anna.

01:11.219 --> 01:14.379
- What look on my face?
- We've got two tickets for the ballet.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.739
That look there.

01:19.739 --> 01:22.099
The only problem is,
who are we going to get to baby-sit?

01:22.099 --> 01:23.579
Why can't you ask your mum?

01:23.579 --> 01:25.978
Because it's tomorrow night
and that's her bridge night.

01:25.980 --> 01:29.658
Oh, finally decided to chuck
herself off one, has she?

01:29.659 --> 01:31.859
I knew your dad would grind her down in the end.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.139
And we can't ask Dad either,

01:33.140 --> 01:35.938
because he's got some big,
important dinner at the golf club.

01:35.939 --> 01:37.819
- Well, ask a friend.
- I can't ask a friend.

01:37.819 --> 01:39.899
Some of them don't know
the kids or what they're like.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.698
So? They're more likely to agree.

01:41.700 --> 01:45.299
If we can't find a family member
to do it, maybe we can't go.

01:45.299 --> 01:47.698
All right, I'll ask me dad.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.299
Your dad?

01:49.299 --> 01:51.778
- Yeah. He's a family member.
- Are you serious?

01:51.780 --> 01:55.218
Yes, I've got a DNA test from the Child
Support Agency to prove it.

01:55.219 --> 01:58.139
Actually, do you know what, Lee? You're right.

01:58.140 --> 02:01.060
I'm being silly, aren't I?
I'll just ask Anna to baby-sit.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.938
- Sorry?
- Well, she knows the kids. She'll be great.

02:04.939 --> 02:07.819
Oh. I'm assuming you've already
asked the Child Catcher

02:07.819 --> 02:09.338
from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

02:09.340 --> 02:11.498
I thought you said it had to be a family member.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.179
- And you said that was ridiculous.
- No, I said I'll ask me dad.

02:14.180 --> 02:16.658
Yeah, well, that's the same thing, isn't it?

02:16.659 --> 02:19.299
Look, I know I'm always banging
on about what a waster he is,

02:19.300 --> 02:22.699
but maybe it's time the kids spent
some time with Grandad Frank,

02:22.699 --> 02:25.058
get to know him, see what he's like as a person.

02:25.060 --> 02:26.378
Maybe.

02:26.379 --> 02:29.338
That way, when I'm slagging him off,
they'll know what I'm talking about.

02:29.340 --> 02:30.778
What do you reckon?

02:30.780 --> 02:34.658
OK. But I can't say he'd be
my first choice of baby-sitter.

02:34.659 --> 02:38.378
Yeah. Well, he wouldn't be my first
choice of father, but he is.

02:38.379 --> 02:40.739
Come on, what's the worst that can happen?

02:40.740 --> 02:42.659
Try not to think too much about that.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.139 --> 02:53.218
Dad'll be here in a minute.

02:53.219 --> 02:54.819
What are you doing?

02:54.819 --> 02:57.459
Nothing. Just having a bit of a tidy.

02:57.460 --> 02:58.819
Oh, I see.

02:58.819 --> 03:00.818
You're hiding the booze.

03:00.819 --> 03:03.218
Dad is not going to come here and get drunk.

03:03.219 --> 03:05.179
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

03:05.180 --> 03:07.500
He'll already be drunk.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.739
- All right, son?
- All right? What's in the bag?

03:13.740 --> 03:15.859
I brought a little hair band,
some ribbons and bows.

03:15.860 --> 03:18.259
- Aww! That's nice. Molly'll like that.
- They're not for her.

03:18.259 --> 03:20.739
They're for you to wear at the ballet.

03:20.740 --> 03:23.218
Ah, here he is, my little Benji.

03:23.219 --> 03:25.859
- That's Charlie.
- Oh, yeah.

03:25.860 --> 03:28.658
You know, you're growing up that fast,
I thought you was the oldest.

03:28.659 --> 03:30.699
He is the oldest.

03:30.699 --> 03:33.538
Hiya, Frank. Say hello to your grandad.

03:33.539 --> 03:35.418
Do I have to kiss him?

03:35.420 --> 03:37.819
Charlie, say hello to Grandad Frank.

03:37.819 --> 03:39.058
Never mind Grandad Frank.

03:39.060 --> 03:41.378
- I want you to start calling me Grandpops.
- Grandpops?

03:41.379 --> 03:44.179
Yeah, that's what I used to call my grandad.

03:44.180 --> 03:48.019
We thought it was nice that I had
a cosy name for the bitter old racist.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.058
Hello, Grandpops.

03:50.060 --> 03:51.338
That's better.

03:51.340 --> 03:52.739
Have you come to burgle us?

03:52.740 --> 03:55.778
- Ha-ha! The questions kids ask.
- Yeah.

03:55.780 --> 03:57.460
Have you come to burgle us?

03:59.219 --> 04:02.699
Oh, here come the other two monkeys.
Are you ready for some fun?

04:02.699 --> 04:07.179
Are you going to teach us to play
poker, like you did at Christmas?

04:07.180 --> 04:10.780
Yeah, but I did give you some of the money
back, though, didn't I?

04:12.819 --> 04:15.259
Frank, I've jotted down a little list of things.

04:15.259 --> 04:16.579
I've set the timer on the oven,

04:16.579 --> 04:19.098
so all you have to do is wait
for the ping and then dish up.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.418
Pyjamas are all laid out,

04:20.420 --> 04:22.978
and bed at eight o'clock
at the very, very latest, please.

04:22.980 --> 04:25.098
You forget, I've raised a child myself.

04:25.100 --> 04:27.459
Have you? You never told me that.

04:27.459 --> 04:29.418
Look, I know I let you down as a father, Lee,

04:29.420 --> 04:31.178
but that's all behind us now.

04:31.180 --> 04:33.738
I want to be the best grandfather I can be.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.579
I promise you, Lucy, I would walk
through fire for those kids.

04:36.579 --> 04:38.658
Please don't.

04:38.659 --> 04:41.338
- We're going to be late.
- OK, well, you've got my phone number,

04:41.340 --> 04:44.259
- so if there's even the slightest problem...
- Yes.

04:44.259 --> 04:45.699
I was talking to the kids.

04:54.019 --> 04:56.459
Frank? We're back.

04:58.100 --> 05:00.899
Well, the furniture's still here.
That's a start.

05:00.899 --> 05:02.459
Dad?

05:02.459 --> 05:04.819
- Please don't say he's popped to the pub.
- I hope not.

05:04.819 --> 05:06.819
Last time he did that, he was gone for 11 years.

05:08.100 --> 05:11.459
You check on the kids. I'll phone his mobile.

05:11.459 --> 05:13.778
Oh, you're back.

05:13.779 --> 05:16.218
- Where have you been?
- Where does it look like?

05:16.220 --> 05:18.658
Cornwall in the 1700s.

05:18.660 --> 05:21.019
I've emptied your recycling bin.

05:21.019 --> 05:23.740
I did a bit of tidying-up. Hope you don't mind.

05:26.740 --> 05:28.139
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

05:28.139 --> 05:31.059
Me and the kids made a bit
of a mess playing pirates,

05:31.060 --> 05:33.218
but I tidied up, did a bit of hoovering.

05:33.220 --> 05:36.178
Even changed a couple of light
bulbs while I were at it.

05:36.180 --> 05:38.098
Where's, er...? Where's Lucy?

05:38.100 --> 05:40.058
Never mind that. Where's my dad?

05:40.060 --> 05:42.019
She's upstairs.

05:42.019 --> 05:44.259
Is she, er...? Is she OK?

05:44.259 --> 05:46.139
- Yeah, she's fine.
- Well...

05:46.139 --> 05:47.738
It's none of my business,

05:47.740 --> 05:50.620
but when I was tidying up, I found
a load of booze under the sink.

05:53.939 --> 05:57.899
Now, I'll say no more, as long
as you know I'm never far away.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.858
That's probably why she needs to drink.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.338
Oh! Hiya, Frank.

06:03.339 --> 06:05.178
Dad's been having a tidy-up.

06:05.180 --> 06:06.658
Oh, yeah.

06:06.660 --> 06:07.978
What's with the face?

06:07.980 --> 06:10.978
Well, after supper, we did
some pirate face-painting,

06:10.980 --> 06:13.059
and that wore 'em out before bath time.

06:13.060 --> 06:14.978
Then we brushed teeth, read stories.

06:14.980 --> 06:17.499
Shouldn't have done two,
but they wouldn't let me stop.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.819
And then they were fast asleep before eight.

06:19.819 --> 06:21.978
Everything on the list is done.

06:21.980 --> 06:23.218
So, do you need a lift home,

06:23.220 --> 06:26.098
or are you just going to open
up your umbrella and take off?

06:26.100 --> 06:28.098
Well, I'll be off.

06:28.100 --> 06:31.139
Any time you want to go
out again, just say the word.

06:31.139 --> 06:32.778
Well, actually, Frank,

06:32.779 --> 06:35.259
Anna and Toby have invited us out next Saturday.

06:35.259 --> 06:37.098
Oh, really? What is it this time, son?

06:37.100 --> 06:39.538
Flower arranging or hopscotch lessons?

06:39.540 --> 06:41.338
- It's tapas.
- Oh.

06:41.340 --> 06:44.459
I was going to ask my mum and dad,
but if you've got nothing on...?

06:44.459 --> 06:47.178
Say no more. I'm looking forward to it already.

06:47.180 --> 06:48.858
Oh, thanks, Frank.

06:48.860 --> 06:51.619
I'm going to go and make myself a drink.
Do you want one, Lee?

06:51.620 --> 06:54.220
Why don't you have a glass
of water with it as well?

07:00.060 --> 07:02.699
What did you make of the ballet, Lee?

07:02.699 --> 07:04.178
Was the principal dancer shocked

07:04.180 --> 07:07.218
when you tried to slip a £10 note down her top?

07:07.220 --> 07:08.858
Quite enjoyed it, actually.

07:08.860 --> 07:11.738
Inspirational doesn't begin
to describe its maverick approach

07:11.740 --> 07:15.418
to this often more traditionally
based piece by Jeremy Rogan.

07:15.420 --> 07:18.379
I think Jeremy Rogan
was the name of the reviewer.

07:22.579 --> 07:25.579
So, everything still OK for our tapas night?

07:25.579 --> 07:28.098
Yup. Lee's dad's all booked in to baby-sit.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.819
Frank? Really?

07:29.819 --> 07:33.139
- You sound surprised, Anna.
- Well, only because... you know.

07:33.139 --> 07:34.658
What?

07:34.659 --> 07:36.180
I've met him.

07:37.899 --> 07:40.298
Well, to be honest, we were
a little nervous at first,

07:40.300 --> 07:42.379
but he did a great job the other night.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.579
Well, good for Frank.

07:44.579 --> 07:46.978
I think it's wonderful to expose the children

07:46.980 --> 07:49.978
to... all different aspects of life.

07:49.980 --> 07:52.379
I wish you had that attitude towards our son.

07:52.379 --> 07:54.259
I recently took Jack on the bus.

07:54.259 --> 07:57.218
I don't think the park and ride shuttle bus

07:57.220 --> 07:59.218
to the Chelsea Flower Show really counts.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.899
Actually, Lucy, if you don't mind,

08:04.899 --> 08:07.459
I think I'll just take the iPad off them.

08:07.459 --> 08:10.139
Leave it, Anna. A bit
of noise never hurt anyone.

08:11.660 --> 08:13.459
And yet looks can kill.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.899
Can you pass that to me, please?

08:17.899 --> 08:21.178
- No.
- Come on, now, Benji, time to hand it over.

08:21.180 --> 08:22.980
Oh, ... off.

08:25.740 --> 08:27.259
What did you say?

08:27.259 --> 08:28.738
Oh, ... off.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.259
I beg your pardon?!

08:30.259 --> 08:31.899
Don't keep making him say it.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.099
Benji, where did you learn that word?

08:36.100 --> 08:37.620
Grandpops said it.

08:40.379 --> 08:41.980
Go to your room right now.

08:44.379 --> 08:46.298
Anna, I'm so, so sorry.

08:46.299 --> 08:48.499
It's fine, really.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.058
Don't believe her. She says that to me.

08:51.059 --> 08:55.259
Anyway, we really need to be on our way. Jack...

08:55.259 --> 08:57.178
Not because of what just happened, I hope.

08:57.179 --> 08:59.620
Yeah, you don't have to leave
just because Benji told you to.

09:02.860 --> 09:05.979
- Toby, I'm so, so sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.659
It's nice to hear someone finally
pluck up the courage to tell her.

09:12.539 --> 09:14.698
I knew we should never have
let your dad baby-sit.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.418
We need to get him round right now

09:16.419 --> 09:17.979
and see what he has to say for himself.

09:17.980 --> 09:20.259
Get him round? That's overreacting
a bit, isn't it?

09:20.259 --> 09:22.979
Oh, so you think it's acceptable
to swear in front of young children?

09:22.980 --> 09:25.458
I never said that, but I'm
sure he didn't mean any harm.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.458
It's... It's just a cultural thing.

09:27.460 --> 09:30.739
Oh, don't start all that "pushing
your bike up the cobbles

09:30.740 --> 09:34.698
"to see your auntie, who was a one-eyed
prostitute" claptrap.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.019
Bad language is bad language.

09:37.019 --> 09:39.538
Look, he's coming over again
on Saturday, anyway, to baby-sit,

09:39.539 --> 09:43.019
so I'll have a chat with him then,
so it's less of a big deal.

09:43.019 --> 09:44.619
You're not serious?

09:44.620 --> 09:46.818
There's no way that he's baby-sitting again.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.658
- What, because of one swearword?
- That we know of.

09:49.659 --> 09:51.778
Who knows what other words he might have used.

09:51.779 --> 09:53.178
All right, let's get Benji down,

09:53.179 --> 09:55.818
read out a list and see
which other ones he recognises.

09:55.820 --> 09:58.899
I'm serious. There is no way
that Frank is baby-sitting again.

09:58.899 --> 10:02.099
- Either you can tell him or I will.
- All right, I will tell him.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.379
And make sure you let him
know exactly the reasons why.

10:04.379 --> 10:07.058
It's important the message gets
across and he knows we're not happy.

10:07.059 --> 10:09.059
Maybe we should get Benji to tell him.

10:17.940 --> 10:19.338
Dad...

10:19.340 --> 10:20.578
Thank you.

10:20.580 --> 10:21.938
Oh, "Barista".

10:21.940 --> 10:23.460
That's a very pretty name.

10:26.340 --> 10:28.818
Dad, about this baby-sitting on Saturday.

10:28.820 --> 10:31.139
Yes, I'm really looking forward to it, son.

10:31.139 --> 10:33.178
Look what I've made the kids.

10:33.179 --> 10:35.578
It's a map of hidden treasure.

10:35.580 --> 10:37.859
I said I'd go in the garden
and help 'em to dig it up.

10:37.860 --> 10:40.379
- X marks the spot.
- You might want to move that a bit.

10:40.379 --> 10:42.979
That's close to where we buried the cat.

10:42.980 --> 10:44.219
The thing is...

10:44.220 --> 10:46.538
When you and Lucy said
to me I'd done a good job,

10:46.539 --> 10:48.179
it meant the world to me, son.

10:49.740 --> 10:52.739
Those kids, they didn't see
me as some daft old man

10:52.740 --> 10:54.538
who were always messing things up.

10:54.539 --> 10:57.019
They saw me as Captain Grandpops,

10:57.019 --> 10:59.099
head of the pirate fleet,

10:59.100 --> 11:01.938
- and I swore there and then...
- I know you did.

11:01.940 --> 11:05.538
...I swore I wouldn't let them
kids down the way I let you down.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.340
I can't wait to baby-sit again.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.379
Right. The thing is...

11:14.059 --> 11:16.099
What?

11:16.100 --> 11:18.938
We don't want you to baby-sit on Saturday.

11:18.940 --> 11:21.980
Why not? What have I done wrong this time?

11:26.580 --> 11:29.139
Nothing. Nothing at all.

11:29.139 --> 11:32.818
You did a great job and we want
to use you again very soon.

11:32.820 --> 11:36.418
It's just that Toby and Anna have
had to cancel the tapas night

11:36.419 --> 11:40.459
because they're going
on a last-minute trip to Spain.

11:40.460 --> 11:43.259
Obviously, they wanted to taste the real thing.

11:43.259 --> 11:46.259
As long as you were pleased with me
baby-sitting the other day.

11:46.259 --> 11:48.058
Dad, you did a brilliant job.

11:48.059 --> 11:51.219
Thanks, son. That means a lot to me.
I'll get off.

11:51.220 --> 11:53.658
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, for...

11:53.659 --> 11:56.938
Hi, Toby. Looking forward to going away?

11:56.940 --> 12:00.698
I was just explaining to my dad why
he can't baby-sit this weekend.

12:00.700 --> 12:02.139
Oh, I see.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.979
Persona non grata, eh, Frank?

12:03.980 --> 12:07.418
Oh, practise the language
before you get there, eh?

12:07.419 --> 12:09.259
I've explained that the evening's cancelled

12:09.259 --> 12:11.859
because you and Anna are going
abroad this weekend.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.859
Oh, yes. That's right.

12:13.860 --> 12:15.259
Italy.

12:16.580 --> 12:18.219
Lee said Spain.

12:18.220 --> 12:21.620
Well, it's sort of on the Spanish-Italian
border, isn't it?

12:22.980 --> 12:26.099
Yeah, there's nothing like a bracing
swim across the Mediterranean

12:26.100 --> 12:28.938
to whet the appetite.

12:28.940 --> 12:30.379
Well, I'll see you later.

12:31.580 --> 12:34.619
- It was just one little white lie.
- I'm not bothered about that.

12:34.620 --> 12:36.778
I'm bothered about the four-letter word

12:36.779 --> 12:40.338
my Jack can't stop saying
since your son taught it to him.

12:40.340 --> 12:43.979
Yesterday he told both the cleaner
and the gardener to eff off.

12:43.980 --> 12:47.340
If either of them spoke
English, we would be mortified.

12:49.220 --> 12:52.099
So I'm assuming you were meant
to confront your dad about it just now

12:52.100 --> 12:53.859
and you chickened out.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.739
No, I didn't chicken out.

12:55.740 --> 12:58.219
I just happen to think my dad
is a bit of a new man.

12:58.220 --> 13:01.379
I think he's got something to offer.
Look at this.

13:01.379 --> 13:03.298
Don't trust him. You'll be digging for ages.

13:03.299 --> 13:05.458
There'll be nothing there.

13:05.460 --> 13:07.458
He never did stuff like this
for me when I was a kid.

13:07.460 --> 13:09.259
I honestly think he might be changing,

13:09.259 --> 13:12.139
and I am not going to punish
him for one simple mistake.

13:12.139 --> 13:14.298
So, no, I didn't chicken out,

13:14.299 --> 13:17.178
cos I don't chicken
out of difficult conversations.

13:17.179 --> 13:20.259
So you're going to tell Lucy what just happened?

13:20.259 --> 13:22.139
Am I hell! She'll bloody kill me.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.459
Oh, we'd better get a move on.

13:33.460 --> 13:35.058
Anna and Toby are picking us up soon.

13:35.059 --> 13:37.259
Still can't believe we cancelled
me dad baby-sitting.

13:37.259 --> 13:39.058
And I can't believe he's had all week

13:39.059 --> 13:41.338
and still hasn't phoned me to apologise.

13:41.340 --> 13:43.298
Well... he's ashamed.

13:43.299 --> 13:45.379
He's never felt shame before.

13:45.379 --> 13:47.259
It's like three-ply quilted toilet paper.

13:47.259 --> 13:49.538
He hadn't felt that till last year.

13:49.539 --> 13:51.739
Well, as long as you made it perfectly clear

13:51.740 --> 13:53.219
that we weren't happy.

13:53.220 --> 13:54.859
I couldn't have been clearer.

13:54.860 --> 13:58.099
I even folded my arms when I said it.
I learnt from the master.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.538
I don't do that.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.658
You always do that. Arms folded for serious.

14:02.659 --> 14:05.219
Weight on the left leg for really serious.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.499
And if you add on a, "I beg your pardon?!"

14:08.500 --> 14:10.899
I know it's time to hit the eject button.

14:10.899 --> 14:12.698
I'm not joking, Lee.

14:12.700 --> 14:15.938
I know. I made it very clear when I told him.

14:15.940 --> 14:18.818
In fact, he was so embarrassed
about the swearing,

14:18.820 --> 14:21.698
he said that if it ever gets
brought up again in conversation,

14:21.700 --> 14:24.298
he'll pretend to know nothing about it.

14:24.299 --> 14:28.698
So it's probably best to never,
ever mention it to him again, ever.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.298
At all.

14:30.299 --> 14:32.338
Well, I suppose it would make it less awkward.

14:32.340 --> 14:33.859
Oh, it certainly would.

14:33.860 --> 14:36.338
Oh, that'll be Mum and Dad.

14:36.340 --> 14:38.460
Mm, I thought the temperature
had suddenly dropped.

14:42.139 --> 14:43.578
Hello, Lucy, love.

14:43.580 --> 14:45.019
Oh.

14:45.019 --> 14:47.538
Hi, Frank. We weren't expecting you.

14:47.539 --> 14:50.139
I know, but you've no need to worry.
I'm not baby-sitting.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.938
It's cancelled. Lee explained.

14:51.940 --> 14:53.338
Good.

14:53.340 --> 14:55.578
Well, I hope you understand the situation.

14:55.580 --> 14:58.058
Well, these things happen. It's no big deal.

14:58.059 --> 15:00.619
It's nice for them to have new
experiences, new language,

15:00.620 --> 15:02.019
that sort of thing.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.259
Dad...

15:06.259 --> 15:08.418
Just brought these things for the kids.

15:08.419 --> 15:10.899
Right. That's very kind of you. See you later.

15:10.899 --> 15:13.778
No, no, wait... Don't you
want to know what it is?

15:13.779 --> 15:15.178
Let me guess.

15:15.179 --> 15:18.058
Is it a DVD of Shaun Ryder doing Jackanory?

15:18.059 --> 15:21.298
It's just a few pirate costumes
that I got from the pound shop.

15:21.299 --> 15:24.818
- What's going on? Why have you got dressed up?
- I haven't.

15:24.820 --> 15:26.740
You have. I can smell toothpaste.

15:28.019 --> 15:29.859
- Are you going out?
- No.

15:29.860 --> 15:31.499
- Yes, we are.
- Oh, sorry.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.338
Um, I forgot to say, Toby and Anna
cancelled at the last minute.

15:34.340 --> 15:36.019
Gone to Spain.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.938
I only spoke to Anna 20 minutes ago.

15:37.940 --> 15:40.778
Well, like I say, it was very last-minute.

15:40.779 --> 15:43.139
Is there another reason why you cancelled me?

15:43.139 --> 15:46.259
You know very well why we cancelled you.

15:46.259 --> 15:47.818
Well, you should know, anyway.

15:47.820 --> 15:49.938
Yeah, but we agreed to forget
about that, didn't we?

15:49.940 --> 15:51.820
- Forget what?
- That's the spirit.

15:53.539 --> 15:55.178
You didn't tell him, did you?

15:55.179 --> 15:56.658
What the hell's going on?

15:56.659 --> 15:59.979
"What the hell"? Frank, you
missed your favourite word.

15:59.980 --> 16:01.339
I'm sorry?

16:01.340 --> 16:03.698
He's apologised. Let's move on.

16:03.700 --> 16:06.538
Clearly, Lee didn't have the guts,
Frank, so I'll tell you.

16:06.539 --> 16:09.938
The day after you were here, Benji
told my friend Anna to eff off.

16:09.940 --> 16:11.539
Well, I can see his point.

16:13.019 --> 16:14.458
Why's that my fault?

16:14.460 --> 16:16.698
Because he heard you using
the word when you baby-sat.

16:16.700 --> 16:19.418
He most certainly did not, cos I never said it.

16:19.419 --> 16:20.818
Well, that's not what Benji says.

16:20.820 --> 16:23.139
Look, can we talk about this later?
We're on our way out.

16:23.139 --> 16:24.259
No, no, no, no.

16:24.259 --> 16:26.578
You two are going nowhere
till we get to the bottom of this.

16:27.860 --> 16:29.979
Whoever that is, you can
tell 'em to go and get...

16:29.980 --> 16:32.299
All right, you're not helping your case.

16:33.379 --> 16:36.899
- Hello.
- Oh, good(!) This'll help calm things down.

16:36.899 --> 16:38.538
Oh, I see.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.619
You've invited the respectable side
of the family to baby-sit, have you?

16:41.620 --> 16:45.338
That's right, Frank. Turned out Roy
Chubby Brown wasn't available.

16:45.340 --> 16:47.178
I was first choice, you know?

16:47.179 --> 16:49.459
Really? You never mentioned that to us, darling.

16:49.460 --> 16:50.658
Why should she mention it?

16:50.659 --> 16:52.698
I've got as much right to baby-sit as you.

16:52.700 --> 16:57.619
Am I right in assuming our untimely
entrance has come mid-altercation?

16:57.620 --> 17:01.139
Now, that's the kind of language you
want to keep your kids away from.

17:01.139 --> 17:02.859
What's going on?

17:02.860 --> 17:04.858
Frank baby-sat last weekend.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.219
Two weekends in a row?

17:06.220 --> 17:08.377
We haven't done anything wrong, have we, Lucy?

17:08.380 --> 17:10.659
Of course not, unlike Frank.

17:10.660 --> 17:12.298
He swore in front of Benji,

17:12.299 --> 17:14.459
and the next day, he repeated
it in front of Anna.

17:14.460 --> 17:18.419
Disgraceful behaviour, although I'd be
lying if I said I was surprised.

17:18.420 --> 17:21.298
Don't you look down your nose
at me, you middle-class ponce.

17:21.299 --> 17:23.459
All right, there's no need for that, Dad.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.897
You would say that, wouldn't you?

17:24.900 --> 17:27.338
Cos you've turned
into a middle-class ponce, too.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.898
- No, I've not. I'm still working-class.
- Oh, yeah(!)

17:29.900 --> 17:31.219
You're like a matchstick man...

17:31.220 --> 17:33.898
in a Lowry painting with your flat
cap and your clogs,

17:33.900 --> 17:37.098
off to get a tapas while you're
going to the ballet.

17:37.099 --> 17:41.138
- Don't start making this about me. I've not changed.
- Course you have.

17:41.140 --> 17:43.138
How long is it since you lived off your wits,

17:43.140 --> 17:45.659
when you wondered where
your next meal were coming from?

17:45.660 --> 17:49.939
Sorry, Dad. I said
I was working-class, not Oliver Twist.

17:49.940 --> 17:51.699
Got nothing to do with class.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.419
Swearing in front of children
is simply not acceptable.

17:54.420 --> 17:55.739
I never swore.

17:55.740 --> 17:57.378
Maybe you didn't realise you'd said it.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.098
The kids were probably in the other room.

17:59.099 --> 18:00.858
It's never an excuse, ever.

18:00.859 --> 18:02.858
Geoffrey, we can't wrap the kids in cotton wool.

18:02.859 --> 18:05.979
No, but maybe you can plug their ears
with it when Frank's here.

18:05.980 --> 18:08.459
I can't believe you didn't ask us to baby-sit.

18:08.460 --> 18:10.219
I would have cancelled my bridge night.

18:10.220 --> 18:11.659
You should have just asked.

18:11.660 --> 18:14.098
Given all the times we've looked
after them, it seems a bit much

18:14.099 --> 18:17.460
that we've now become second choice to...
his side of the family.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.659
Oh, sorry, me? I thought
Genghis Khan had walked in.

18:21.660 --> 18:24.739
- You're not second choice.
- Is that right?

18:24.740 --> 18:27.220
Yeah, Anna was second choice.
You were third choice.

18:28.460 --> 18:30.778
This is your fault we weren't asked first.

18:30.779 --> 18:32.858
I told you Nick Faldo's autobiography

18:32.859 --> 18:34.979
does not make a good bedtime story.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.578
Don't start on me.

18:36.579 --> 18:38.939
I'm not the one swearing at my grandchildren.

18:38.940 --> 18:40.138
Neither am I.

18:40.140 --> 18:42.858
Sorry, Frank? You calling my grandson a liar?

18:42.859 --> 18:45.858
- Maybe.
- Why would he lie about something like that?

18:45.859 --> 18:47.499
I don't know.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.700
Maybe your daughter's not
bringing him up properly.

18:53.579 --> 18:55.779
I beg your pardon?!

18:57.259 --> 19:00.419
Dad, it's time to hit the eject button.

19:00.420 --> 19:03.419
Right, that's it. Benji, get in here right now.

19:03.420 --> 19:06.338
- There's no need for this. Dad's not on trial.
- Exactly. I object.

19:06.339 --> 19:07.659
Overruled.

19:07.660 --> 19:09.778
Benji,

19:09.779 --> 19:12.098
do you remember that bad word you said to Anna?

19:12.099 --> 19:14.179
- Yes, it was...
- No!

19:14.180 --> 19:15.858
Don't say it.

19:15.859 --> 19:18.298
Just tell us again where you heard it first.

19:18.299 --> 19:19.858
Grandpops said it.

19:19.859 --> 19:23.298
Will the defendant please rise?

19:23.299 --> 19:24.778
Oh, sorry.

19:24.779 --> 19:26.339
You're already stood up.

19:27.819 --> 19:30.098
Not that grandpops.

19:30.099 --> 19:32.019
That grandpops.

19:36.339 --> 19:38.739
But that's not Grandpops.

19:38.740 --> 19:40.138
That's Grandad.

19:40.140 --> 19:42.939
Charlie told me we were supposed
to call them both Grandpops

19:42.940 --> 19:44.659
from now on.

19:44.660 --> 19:46.499
No, that's only Grandad Frank.

19:46.500 --> 19:47.740
Oh. My bad.

19:49.299 --> 19:52.538
Hang on a minute. Grandad Geoffrey
didn't even baby-sit last week.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.778
It wasn't last week I heard him say the word.

19:54.779 --> 19:55.898
It was another time.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.299
We were at his house and he was on the phone.

20:00.420 --> 20:02.900
- Can I go into the garden now?
- Yes.

20:04.339 --> 20:05.660
Can I come?

20:07.059 --> 20:10.939
Can I just say...? I agree
with every word that Lucy's saying.

20:10.940 --> 20:15.618
I think that swearing is a terrible
thing to do around young kiddies.

20:15.619 --> 20:17.739
Obviously there's been some mistake.

20:17.740 --> 20:20.019
Geoffrey doesn't use language like that.

20:20.019 --> 20:23.338
- Sorry, Wendy, are you calling my grandson a liar?
- Dad?

20:23.339 --> 20:26.138
How am I supposed to keep
track of every word I say?

20:26.140 --> 20:29.140
Oh, so you eff and jeff
all the time, do you, Effy Geoffy?

20:30.500 --> 20:34.019
Dad, did you swear in front of Benji, yes or no?

20:34.019 --> 20:36.098
You never gave me multiple choice.

20:36.099 --> 20:38.979
Well, now you come to mention it, there was a...

20:38.980 --> 20:41.179
a terse phone call I made to the golf club

20:41.180 --> 20:44.378
about them changing my seating
arrangements at the dinner.

20:44.380 --> 20:47.058
I did use some rather brisk language.

20:47.059 --> 20:50.179
I thought the children were
out of earshot in the other room.

20:50.180 --> 20:52.819
Oh, never an excuse, Geoffrey, ever.

20:54.019 --> 20:59.420
Frank, I am so very, very sorry
for accusing you, and so's my dad.

21:00.460 --> 21:05.338
Is he? I must have missed that.
Could you repeat it, Geoffrey?

21:05.339 --> 21:06.659
Dad?

21:06.660 --> 21:09.700
Believe me, I really do
wish this hadn't happened.

21:10.819 --> 21:12.019
Still waiting.

21:13.259 --> 21:15.338
Go on, Geoffrey.

21:15.339 --> 21:17.019
Frank...

21:17.019 --> 21:20.259
I'm sorry for any distress I might have caused.

21:20.259 --> 21:23.538
I only hope it's offset
by the immense self-satisfaction

21:23.539 --> 21:26.179
I can see plastered all over your face

21:26.180 --> 21:30.059
now that you're experiencing
the novelty of the moral high ground.

21:31.900 --> 21:35.298
Well, I'd take that, Dad.
It's as good as you're going to get.

21:35.299 --> 21:37.098
Well, I'm glad we got all that sorted out.

21:37.099 --> 21:39.259
Maybe we should have a clearer
system from now on.

21:39.259 --> 21:42.019
You should be Grandad G
and you should be Grandad F.

21:42.019 --> 21:43.940
Oh, I think he should be Grandad F.

21:46.740 --> 21:50.219
Anyway, can we put it
all behind us and just move on?

21:50.220 --> 21:51.939
Oh, hang on! Is that it?

21:51.940 --> 21:54.179
Well, I've said sorry. I can't keep saying it.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.378
No, I don't mean that.

21:55.380 --> 21:58.098
When we thought my dad had sworn,
we had to have a crisis meeting.

21:58.099 --> 22:00.378
Well, we should have one now with your dad.

22:00.380 --> 22:02.898
- Are you serious?
- Oh, I'm deadly serious.

22:02.900 --> 22:05.459
OK, then. Fine.

22:05.460 --> 22:07.779
Dad... follow me.

22:14.539 --> 22:17.898
- There. Done it.
- You didn't say anything.

22:17.900 --> 22:20.739
No, and neither did you
to your dad at the coffee shop.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.499
- Did you find that acceptable?
- No.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.378
Well, I don't find this acceptable.

22:25.380 --> 22:27.939
You've got 'em, son. They're on the ropes.

22:27.940 --> 22:30.618
Look, this is all nonsense. My dad's apologised.

22:30.619 --> 22:33.939
Nobody owes anybody else any more apologies.

22:33.940 --> 22:36.019
- Is that right?
- Oh, for God's sake, Mum.

22:36.019 --> 22:40.298
- I'm sorry that you were second-choice baby-sitter.
- Third.

22:40.299 --> 22:42.898
And I am sorry that I accused your dad.

22:42.900 --> 22:46.138
Now, can we all just move on, please?

22:46.140 --> 22:48.618
- Father?
- I'm a reasonable man.

22:48.619 --> 22:51.699
And do you promise to bring this
up in the future at every opportunity?

22:51.700 --> 22:53.578
Of course.

22:53.579 --> 22:55.979
Then consider the matter dropped.

22:55.980 --> 22:57.098
Good.

22:57.099 --> 23:00.058
Now, I'm sorry to rush things
along, but any minute now,

23:00.059 --> 23:02.058
Anna and Toby are going to land in our garden

23:02.059 --> 23:05.259
in an easyJet plane from Barcelona
to take us out for tapas,

23:05.259 --> 23:08.338
so if you don't mind,
Frank, we'll see you later?

23:08.339 --> 23:11.058
What are you talking about? I'm not leaving.

23:11.059 --> 23:13.818
I'm baby-sitting.

23:13.819 --> 23:15.818
Wendy and Geoffrey are the ones who are leaving.

23:15.819 --> 23:18.138
Frank, Mum and Dad are baby-sitting tonight.

23:18.140 --> 23:21.019
Yes, but that was before we knew
your father had a pottymouth.

23:21.019 --> 23:24.179
Yeah, and it was my dad
that was asked first, remember?

23:24.180 --> 23:26.499
Oh, I remember.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.979
But then we cancelled him.

23:27.980 --> 23:30.338
Yes, because we thought he'd used bad language,

23:30.339 --> 23:33.298
but now we know it was your dad
that swore, we should cancel him.

23:33.299 --> 23:36.979
Exactly. Who knows what other
filth they might have heard?

23:36.980 --> 23:40.298
I'm beginning to wonder whether
the full scale of these horrors

23:40.299 --> 23:42.578
will ever be understood.

23:42.579 --> 23:46.298
Well, there's a simple solution.
Lucy, who do you want to baby-sit?

23:46.299 --> 23:49.098
Sorry, do I get a vote? I'm 18 now.

23:49.099 --> 23:51.659
Well, I'm not leaving. I never swore.

23:51.660 --> 23:53.098
Fair point.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.979
Me and Wendy will snuggle
down on the settee and do it together.

23:56.980 --> 23:59.338
Come on, Lucy, who do you want to baby-sit?

23:59.339 --> 24:02.098
- Well, I...
- They're our grandchildren, Lucy.

24:02.099 --> 24:04.019
- They're my grandchildren, too.
- Come off it.

24:04.019 --> 24:06.858
For years, your feckless behaviour
has meant that you've come and gone,

24:06.859 --> 24:09.578
whereas Wendy and I have been hands-on
grandparents from the start.

24:09.579 --> 24:11.659
Keep pushing me, I'll show you hands-on.

24:11.660 --> 24:15.058
Oh, here it comes, the full Coronation Street.

24:15.059 --> 24:17.818
I've a good mind to come over there
and wash your mouth out with soap.

24:17.819 --> 24:20.578
What, and risk getting some of it on your hands?

24:20.579 --> 24:22.298
I've no need to listen to this.

24:22.299 --> 24:24.380
I quite agree. Off you go.

24:25.900 --> 24:27.539
Buenas noches, amigos.

24:30.779 --> 24:32.618
You can stop that nonsense.

24:32.619 --> 24:36.019
I know you're not really in Spain, you liar.

24:36.019 --> 24:38.618
Don't criticise my husband like that.

24:38.619 --> 24:41.180
Yeah. Let Anna show you how to do it properly.

24:43.579 --> 24:46.939
Thanks to your foul mouth
and your filthy-mouthed grandchild,

24:46.940 --> 24:49.699
my Jack is running around cursing
like a scaffolder.

24:49.700 --> 24:51.778
Don't you talk about my grandson like that.

24:51.779 --> 24:53.739
You may think of yourself as all high and mighty

24:53.740 --> 24:56.058
because you've gone
up in the baby-sitting pecking order,

24:56.059 --> 24:57.538
but he's still my flesh and blood.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.338
Yeah, don't start having a go at my son.

24:59.339 --> 25:01.939
Oh, yeah, but it's all right for people
to have a go at your father?

25:01.940 --> 25:05.179
That's different. You're big enough and ugly
enough to look after yourself.

25:05.180 --> 25:06.659
Well, ugly enough.

25:06.660 --> 25:09.499
I knew it wouldn't be long
before they turned on each other.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.858
- Like father, like son.
- Oh, that's rich,

25:11.859 --> 25:14.298
coming from a man who screams
obscenities at little kiddies.

25:14.299 --> 25:16.219
For goodness' sake, you silly little man!

25:16.220 --> 25:18.179
He was on the phone to the golf club.

25:18.180 --> 25:19.818
So you say, but for all we know,

25:19.819 --> 25:22.219
he could have been on a loudspeaker on the phone

25:22.220 --> 25:23.740
to a premium-rate sex line.

25:25.180 --> 25:26.939
I've just about had enough of this.

25:26.940 --> 25:28.858
Oh, yeah? You want to get it on?

25:32.539 --> 25:36.460
Oh, will you all just shut the ... up?

25:39.900 --> 25:42.259
You're all a bunch of ... idiots.

25:42.259 --> 25:43.858
You're a pompous ... hole.

25:43.859 --> 25:46.179
You're always out for a ...
fight with everyone you meet,

25:46.180 --> 25:47.578
you silly ...

25:47.579 --> 25:49.578
You're a stupidly oversensitive ... head.

25:49.579 --> 25:52.219
You're a stuck-up ...
You're a lying ...

25:52.220 --> 25:54.898
And if you'd had a ...
with this ... in the first place,

25:54.900 --> 25:57.778
we wouldn't be in this ... of a ... mess.

25:57.779 --> 26:00.138
Well, I've had en ...ough.

26:00.140 --> 26:03.380
None of you ... can ... baby-sit!

26:16.380 --> 26:18.900
Mummy, what's a ...?

26:31.619 --> 26:33.259
I'm a terrible mother.

26:34.619 --> 26:36.259
Have you finished that word?

26:39.180 --> 26:41.660
Feel free to try and comfort me at any point.

26:43.259 --> 26:46.419
Look... like I've been trying
to tell you all week,

26:46.420 --> 26:49.259
it is possible to accidentally
swear in front of the children

26:49.259 --> 26:51.378
without it making you a bad person.

26:51.380 --> 26:53.579
The kids will have forgotten
about it by tomorrow.

26:54.579 --> 26:56.739
All right, by next week.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.179
All right, if they're still
in therapy when they're 18,

26:59.180 --> 27:01.420
we'll say it wasn't you,
it was their real mother.

27:02.740 --> 27:04.459
Well, whatever happens,

27:04.460 --> 27:07.858
I'm going to make sure the kids
don't hear any more swearwords.

27:07.859 --> 27:10.539
To be fair, I don't think there
are any more swearwords.

27:12.140 --> 27:15.019
Now I've just got to make it
up to everyone I insulted.

27:15.019 --> 27:16.818
Well...

27:16.819 --> 27:19.138
I'm one of the people you insulted.

27:19.140 --> 27:21.219
Maybe you should make it up to me.

27:21.220 --> 27:24.618
Is that right? And how am I supposed to do that?

27:24.619 --> 27:27.019
Well, use your imagination.

27:27.019 --> 27:29.619
Which, as it turns out, is a lot
filthier than I ever thought.

27:32.779 --> 27:35.459
How about I just take us for a nice meal out?

27:35.460 --> 27:37.499
You know, just the two of us.

27:37.500 --> 27:40.500
Well, you could, but who are you
going to ask to baby-sit?

27:42.220 --> 27:43.900
All right, you win.
