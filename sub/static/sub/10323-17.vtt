There's nothing more romantic...

00:03.137 --> 00:06.074
than the morning after
a honeymoon with your new bride.

00:06.107 --> 00:09.177
You change
your own sheets today.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.345
Wow.
Last night--

00:11.379 --> 00:14.215
I mean, that was--
Ooh.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.417
I didn't get too rough
with you, did I?

00:16.450 --> 00:18.752
It's nothin'
a bucket of ice on
my husband parts can't fix.

00:18.786 --> 00:21.455
I have a little
surprise for you.

00:21.489 --> 00:24.225
I started up my own list.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.496
Oh, my God!
This is fantastic!

00:28.529 --> 00:31.532
You actually--
Give me a second.

00:34.302 --> 00:37.571
Thank you, karma!
You gave me the best
woman in the world!

Screw you! I came
to this motel to die!

Yeah! Stop showing off
your happiness!

[ Man #2 ]
Somebody help!
My hooker stopped breathing!

00:45.479 --> 00:48.282

I finally found my soul mate!

[ Bullet Ricochets ]
My bad.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.321
Sorry for the outburst.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.359
The neighbors
send their regards.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.661
My name is Earl.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.101
[ Earl Narrating ]
I knew marriage was about
give and take.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.503
I just didn't realize
how much I would have to give...

01:09.537 --> 01:11.539
and how much Billie would take.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.674
What's, uh, goin' on
with the chips, honey?

01:13.707 --> 01:16.210
Sharing-- It's what
married people do.

01:16.244 --> 01:20.114
Well, it's just that I have
everything timed out perfectly
for "crunch, sandwich, crunch."

01:20.148 --> 01:23.784
Now that you took that chip,
I'm gonna be left with one bite
of sandwich and no crunch.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.753
That's crazy, baby.

01:25.786 --> 01:29.723
Uh, it's not crazy.
Just what I like to do.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.893
Yeah, but I'm a sharer.
I mean, that just who I am.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.196
[ Earl Narrating ]
When you marry a woman
you hardly know,

01:35.229 --> 01:37.331
you have to learn a lot
about her quickly,

01:37.365 --> 01:39.400
and that's what I was doin'
with Billie.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.869
I learned
she always kept track
of my comings and goings.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.871
Where you goin'?
Soda machine.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.906
What are you getting?
Soda.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.242
When are you comin' back?
When I get soda.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.511
Love you!

01:50.544 --> 01:53.481
I learned she had
different ideas about
clothes than I did.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.419
Oh, my God.
What do you think?

01:58.452 --> 02:00.721
I can't
breathe.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.457
And I learned a little bit
about her boundaries.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.793
She had none.
Whoa! Private time!

02:05.826 --> 02:08.529
Shy pee-er in here!
Don't be ridiculous.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.498
We're married now.
You don't have to be shy.

** [ Rock ]

02:14.568 --> 02:17.871
This song is lame.
Someone has to take control
of this jukebox.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.441
I'm gonna go put on
some Van Halen.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.177
Sweet! J-19--
"Runnin' With the Devil."

02:23.211 --> 02:26.847
Ew, no!
The real Van Halen,
with Sammy Hagar.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.922
I don't get it, Randy.
Clearly, karma wants me
and Billie to be together.

02:34.955 --> 02:37.858
But there's 20 songs on that
jukebox with David Lee Roth
Van Halen,

02:37.891 --> 02:39.860
and she spends
good money
on a Hagar?

02:39.893 --> 02:42.363
I know, Earl.
But a lot of people like him.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.465
That's why it's on the jukebox.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.468
Maybe so, but what about
that crap she pulled
with the chips?

02:47.501 --> 02:49.603
Some people don't mind
sharin' chips.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.546
Please.
It's no big deal.
I'll get a crunch next time.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.616
Wow.

03:02.650 --> 03:06.354
Everybody's got some
little annoying habits, Earl,
even you.

03:06.387 --> 03:10.758
Like when you're thinkin'?
You always raise just
one eyebrow. I hate that.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.960
[ Earl Narrating ]
Maybe Randy was right.

03:12.993 --> 03:16.264
Maybe the problem
wasn't my wife.
Maybe the problem was me.

- [ Groans ]
- Great jukebox.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.871
They even have
some Lynyrd Skynyrd
from after the plane crash.

03:23.904 --> 03:28.576
[ Earl Narrating ] I decided
to focus on the one thing I knew
we could agree on-- the list.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.211
Let's see.
What should we do
first on your list?

03:32.446 --> 03:34.548
Hey, this guy's
on my list too.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.285
[ Earl Narrating ]
In Camden County, if you were
a champion bagger,

03:37.318 --> 03:39.687
it usually meant that
you bagged a lot of chicks.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.722
But Joel was
a different kind of bagger.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.024
You're watching
Camden's own Joel Maloney...

03:44.057 --> 03:48.496
demonstrating the skill
that's earned him a place in the
National Bagging Competition,

03:48.529 --> 03:53.267
scheduled to kick off tomorrow
in beautiful Youngstown, Ohio,
rivet capital of the world.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.769
Joel, are you nervous?
Kind of.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.972
But, you know, this is
what everybody who's ever worked
at a grocery store dreams of.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.342
Bringin' home
that Golden Sack!

04:01.375 --> 04:04.678
-That loser's goin' out of town.
-While he's gone
we should clean him out.

04:04.712 --> 04:08.482
I'm sick of all those grocery
workers walkin' around, actin'
like they're better than us.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.518
[ Earl Narrating ]
And once word spread,

04:10.551 --> 04:12.853
every criminal in Camden
decided to go shopping.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.823
As a courtesy, everyone
who stole from Joel
left the TV on...

04:15.856 --> 04:18.459
so the others could see
when he was on his way back.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.028
I'm here live
at the National
Bagging Competition...

04:21.061 --> 04:24.398
with one of the hot, young
newcomers on the scene
this year, Joel Maloney.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.934
Joel, congratulations
on your first-round victory.

04:26.967 --> 04:30.371
Most people
don't realize how exhausting
competitive bagging is.

04:30.404 --> 04:35.075
Actually, I had to run out
and put some more quarters in
the parking meter, but thanks.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.978

The longer poor Joel competed,
the emptier his house got.

04:40.581 --> 04:43.884
And Billie,
just like everyone else,
wanted a piece of the action.

04:43.917 --> 04:46.920
[ Scoffs ]
Should've got here earlier.

on this one!

05:04.538 --> 05:06.640
It's the third day
of competition,

05:06.674 --> 05:09.810
and nobody's
come within 12 nectarines
of the pride of Camden.

By the time we got there,

05:11.945 --> 05:13.747
people had already stolen
everything that
wasn't nailed down.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.783
So we took what was.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.851
I know
you're disappointed, Joel.

05:17.885 --> 05:21.389
But second place is still
something to be proud of.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.091
What are you gonna do
with that $25 gift certificate
to Applebee's?

05:25.693 --> 05:27.661
I guess I'll go
to Applebee's.

Joel thought
he was disappointed then.

05:34.034 --> 05:37.070
But it was
about to get a lot worse.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.072
Of course when Joel came home
with his gift certificate,

05:39.106 --> 05:41.074
he saw that
his house was trashed.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.083
The first stop in repaying Joel
was to visit Joy's
tipped-over trailer...

05:50.117 --> 05:52.686
to get back
his carpet and his TV.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.690
Excuse me.
Just curious, but how do you
use the bathroom in here?

05:56.724 --> 05:59.493

on the exhaust fan.

but it works like a dream.

believed this guy's foreplay.

But I accepted it.

your partner
makes you put up with.

likes the way the lady cat
screeches when he humps her?

a lot of memories, Earl.

Remember when
I took it up on the roof
and tried to fly on it?

06:58.686 --> 07:00.754
Hard to forget.
You cracked your head open,

you thought you were president
of an insurance company.

- Nothin' personal, Earl.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.995

making the sales.

hated you.

I appreciate
your good intentions, Earl,

You cross your right hand
under your left,

uncross it before you
reached for the next item.

I-I think so.

who's moving on
to the elite eight.

12:18.271 --> 12:22.209
[ Earl Narrating ] I also
won the second round against
some schmo from Schenectady.

And Barry Schmo
heads home with an empty sack.

against Lance Parker,

by the name of Bagger Lance.

on paper or plastic?

are really tight.

If we did yours in order,
at least we'd have
some idea how we're doin'.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.438
I called everyone up
and said I was sorry.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.341
So the tourists you
carjacked and robbed--

13:28.375 --> 13:30.377
you just said
you were sorry?

13:30.410 --> 13:33.080
Well, actually,
they're back in Japan.

13:33.113 --> 13:36.349
And the Japanese hunt whales,
and that's bad.
So I figured it was a wash.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.419
And you feel fine
about that?
Yeah.

Karma doesn't have to be
as hard as you make it,

I mean, three years and
you haven't even finished half
the stuff on your list?

two weeks off
for the chicken pox.

is work smarter, not harder.
