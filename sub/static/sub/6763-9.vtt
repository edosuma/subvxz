02:09.082 --> 02:11.357
David, get out of here. Mom.

02:11.602 --> 02:13.194
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were in here.

02:13.362 --> 02:15.273
Get out of here, now.

02:15.442 --> 02:17.910
- Get out...
- I'm going, I'm sorry.

02:18.082 --> 02:19.993
Oh, my God.

02:29.162 --> 02:31.312
- You got season tickets to the Kings?
- Yeah.

02:31.482 --> 02:33.393
- Maybe we'll go sometime.
- You're on.

02:33.562 --> 02:34.677
Andrea?

02:34.842 --> 02:36.958
What did you do, sleep here?

02:37.682 --> 02:41.516
Now, there's a thought. I could gain 20
minutes by not commuting from home.

02:42.482 --> 02:45.633
<i>How to Get Into the College</i>
<i>of Your Choice,</i> what's this?

02:45.802 --> 02:48.236
Brandon, college counselling
appointments are all this week.

02:48.402 --> 02:50.074
Between the paper classes
and rap line,

02:50.242 --> 02:52.358
this is the only time
I have to prepare.

02:52.802 --> 02:55.077
I would've thought colleges would be
throwing scholarship money

02:55.242 --> 02:56.595
at your feet.

02:56.962 --> 02:58.953
Well, there've been a few.

02:59.122 --> 03:00.953
But none of the top ones.

03:01.122 --> 03:05.638
I mean, who wants to spend four years
going to school in Cicely, Alaska?

03:06.442 --> 03:08.797
Andrea, you're one of the
smartest kids at West Beverly.

03:08.962 --> 03:10.918
I really don't think
you have much to worry about.

03:11.082 --> 03:13.960
Getting accepted into the right college
is the most important thing in my life.

03:14.122 --> 03:16.795
- It's everything I've ever worked for.
- I understand.

03:16.962 --> 03:19.999
- We're all in the same boat here.
- The same boat? The same bo...

03:20.162 --> 03:22.437
Brandon, all you have to do
is figure out where you're gonna go

03:22.602 --> 03:25.036
and you're set. I not only have
to figure out where I'm gonna go,

03:25.202 --> 03:27.921
but how in the world
I'm gonna pay for it.

03:45.202 --> 03:47.921
Mr. Hutchins, I need you to open up
my locker, it won't budge.

03:48.082 --> 03:50.152
Yeah. You're just gonna have
to take a number, son.

03:50.322 --> 03:51.994
As soon as I finish with this
here light bulb,

03:52.162 --> 03:54.232
I've gotta restock
the boy's bathroom with toilet paper.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.313
Come on, man.
I got all my books in there.

03:56.882 --> 04:00.557
Well, that's not my problem now,
is it?

04:01.562 --> 04:02.756
I'll tell you what.

04:02.922 --> 04:05.516
You give me your locker number,
as soon as I'm done with my chores...

04:05.682 --> 04:07.400
Hutch, Hutch.

04:07.562 --> 04:09.393
Give me a break, please.

04:09.562 --> 04:13.077
Oh, wipe that pathetic look
off your face, will you?

04:13.922 --> 04:15.071
Which one is it?

04:17.522 --> 04:19.591
Your boyfriend is a sleaze monger.

04:19.762 --> 04:21.992
Kelly, you said yourself
that David had a Walkman on.

04:22.162 --> 04:24.801
- How could he hear the shower?
- I don't know, but that's not the point.

04:24.962 --> 04:28.352
The point is that I have no privacy
in my own home. It is so humiliating.

04:28.522 --> 04:30.194
Kelly, what happened
to you yesterday?

04:30.362 --> 04:33.479
- I waited until 3:30.
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry, Mrs. Teasley.

04:33.642 --> 04:34.631
It totally slipped my mind.

04:34.802 --> 04:37.475
Kelly, these college counselling
sessions are very important.

04:37.642 --> 04:39.200
Your whole future's on the line here.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.637
- You can't just forget about it.
- I know.

04:41.802 --> 04:43.679
You'll need to reschedule
as soon as possible.

04:43.842 --> 04:46.481
Donna, don't forget
your appointment's tomorrow.

04:46.642 --> 04:49.520
- I won't, 10:00.
- Yeah.

04:50.042 --> 04:53.557
Yeah, remind me to put that
at the top of my list of things to do.

04:55.842 --> 04:58.993
- Thanks, Hutch, I appreciate it.
- Yeah, next time it's gonna cost you.

04:59.162 --> 05:00.959
Man, did you forget
your locker combination again?

05:01.122 --> 05:03.113
What is this like the 30th time?

05:03.282 --> 05:05.671
Fourth, but who's counting?

05:05.842 --> 05:07.753
Now, listen up all you
Wildcat cheerleading wannabes.

05:07.922 --> 05:12.234
Tryouts for the cheerleading squad
will take place the...

05:19.122 --> 05:20.874
The tryouts.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.756
David, stop staring at me.

05:26.082 --> 05:30.155
Cheerleading tryouts
will be Wednesday at 3:00.

05:31.882 --> 05:33.838
What's going on with you and Kelly,
man?

05:34.002 --> 05:35.754
Nothing, it's just a little
family squabble.

05:35.922 --> 05:37.719
Come on, David, fess up.

05:37.882 --> 05:40.954
Hey man, I'm not just your
business associate, I'm your friend.

05:41.122 --> 05:43.078
Either way, I'm here for you.

05:45.522 --> 05:47.638
Who taught you how to kiss?

05:47.802 --> 05:50.953
Kissers aren't made, they're born.

05:51.122 --> 05:55.274
There's always a first time.
Who was she?

05:58.522 --> 06:01.878
Her name was Trudy.
It was in 5th grade.

06:02.042 --> 06:04.351
She charged a quarter a lesson.

06:05.202 --> 06:07.193
Damn good teacher.

06:09.362 --> 06:12.115
Glad to see you've gotten over
this age thing.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.840
- You're yanking my chain, Silver.
- Steve, I swear.

06:19.002 --> 06:20.913
Okay, a little pop quiz.

06:21.082 --> 06:23.232
Does Kelly Taylor
have any distinguishing birthmarks?

06:23.402 --> 06:25.677
Yeah, on her upper left thigh.

06:27.002 --> 06:28.321
It's sort of shaped like a pear.

06:28.482 --> 06:30.632
Actually, no, it's more like a pear
with a bite out of it.

06:30.802 --> 06:34.875
- Oh, you dirty dog.
- She's a goddess, Steve.

06:35.402 --> 06:36.881
I know.

06:42.642 --> 06:45.315
I said stop staring at me.

06:48.722 --> 06:51.077
It is not like David
walked in on you on purpose.

06:51.242 --> 06:52.391
Would you just give him a break?

06:52.562 --> 06:54.598
I can't believe
you're sticking up for him.

06:54.762 --> 06:57.322
You know what I think?
I think you're jealous.

06:58.002 --> 06:59.515
- Excuse me?
- Well,

06:59.682 --> 07:02.480
for the first time I have a boyfriend
and you don't.

07:02.642 --> 07:04.075
And I think it's getting to you.

07:05.042 --> 07:06.794
That is absolutely untrue.

07:07.802 --> 07:11.920
All right, let's get started
by opening our creative minds.

07:12.082 --> 07:15.518
And exploring the subject that
has fascinated artists for centuries.

07:15.682 --> 07:16.876
The female form.

07:17.362 --> 07:20.195
Artists have always expressed
their visions in so many different ways.

07:20.362 --> 07:22.478
The most famous of course,
being the nude.

07:22.642 --> 07:24.598
Anyone of you here
know of any famous nudes?

07:24.762 --> 07:27.322
- Venus de Milo.
- Good, Nikki, yes.

07:27.602 --> 07:29.354
Kelly Taylor.

07:40.322 --> 07:43.758
What are these, man,
Cliff Notes to <i>Of Mice and Men?</i>

07:43.922 --> 07:46.800
I read the book, okay? These just
help me with my comprehension.

07:48.002 --> 07:50.152
What's this? Meyers' reading list?

07:50.322 --> 07:51.391
Good old AP English.

07:51.562 --> 07:53.792
Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Norman Mailer,
Theodore Dreiser

07:53.962 --> 07:56.795
and the poetry of Langston Hughes.
That's good stuff, man.

07:57.202 --> 07:59.796
- You read them all, huh?
- Every one.

08:00.482 --> 08:02.279
Hey, Kel, how're you doing?

08:02.442 --> 08:04.717
- Is the peeping Silver here?
- No.

08:04.882 --> 08:05.871
Then I'm fine.

08:06.802 --> 08:09.032
Kelly, I hear you've been giving David
a pretty rough time.

08:09.202 --> 08:10.476
Word gets around.

08:10.642 --> 08:11.995
Well, I mean,
can you blame the kid?

08:12.162 --> 08:17.680
God knows I'd be staring if I saw you
standing there all wet and naked.

08:17.842 --> 08:19.275
Dylan.

08:20.482 --> 08:22.154
- Brandon, is Brenda here?
- No, she's at home

08:22.322 --> 08:24.153
preparing for her college counselling
meeting.

08:24.322 --> 08:25.994
- Preparing?
- Yeah, she's not preparing,

08:26.162 --> 08:27.311
she's obsessing.

08:27.482 --> 08:29.552
Hey, come on, guys,
this college thing's important.

08:29.722 --> 08:31.758
- Not to me.
- Not to me.

08:33.361 --> 08:36.034
Well, I've narrowed it down
to Swarthmore, Duke,

08:36.202 --> 08:38.238
- Vassar and Brandeis.
- What?

08:38.402 --> 08:39.721
Colleges.

08:39.881 --> 08:42.554
- What's your first choice?
- None of them.

08:43.082 --> 08:44.401
Well, then, where do you wanna go?

08:45.682 --> 08:48.037
There's only really one school
I've been dreaming of

08:48.202 --> 08:50.158
ever since I started high school.

08:51.282 --> 08:53.159
Sounds like?

08:54.042 --> 08:55.031
Yale.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.874
Sounds like Yale.

08:58.042 --> 09:00.112
- Well, what's stopping you, Andrea?
- I don't know.

09:00.282 --> 09:03.160
I mean, it's just Yale.

09:03.322 --> 09:05.472
Come on, I mean, Andrea,
if anybody's got a shot, you do.

09:05.642 --> 09:08.873
- They'd be lucky to have you.
- Absolutely. Do it for all of us.

09:22.002 --> 09:25.119
Come on, Andrea, you can do it.
You can do it.

09:25.282 --> 09:28.399
If you make it over here,
you can go to Yale.

09:28.842 --> 09:31.072
Besides, we're counting on you.

09:39.522 --> 09:43.117
Hey, Andrea, isn't Gil Meyers
your AP English teacher?

09:43.682 --> 09:46.515
- Yeah.
- And your newspaper adviser?

09:47.602 --> 09:50.958
- Yeah.
- So, what's he doing in your dream?

09:55.522 --> 09:58.195
Mr. Meyers, stop it.
You're gonna make me fall.

09:58.362 --> 10:02.321
Andrea, I didn't know
I had that kind of effect on you.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.916
A B+ average,
plus your extracurricular activities.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.959
I think you'll have
some excellent choices.

10:27.122 --> 10:28.919
Have you decided
where you'd like to apply?

10:29.082 --> 10:31.391
Well, I'm not sure.
I was thinking about Northwestern.

10:31.562 --> 10:33.678
I hear they have a great
journalism department.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.355
Definitely Northwestern.

10:35.522 --> 10:37.831
They have one of the best
theatre departments in the country

10:38.002 --> 10:39.321
and I love acting.

10:39.482 --> 10:41.950
Well, Stanford's kind of a long shot.

10:42.122 --> 10:44.033
Stanford's near the top of my list.

10:44.202 --> 10:46.762
And I was also thinking about NYU.

10:46.922 --> 10:49.038
But I don't know,
living in New York City?

10:49.202 --> 10:53.195
Greenwich Village, Broadway?
Wow, I would love to live in Manhattan.

10:53.362 --> 10:56.115
- I hear BU's a good school.
- I hear BU's a good school.

10:56.282 --> 10:59.513
Well, those are all excellent choices,
but they're also pretty expensive.

10:59.682 --> 11:02.640
And I'm sure you know it costs
a lot more to go to school out of state.

11:02.962 --> 11:04.998
- We're not exactly poor.
- We're not exactly rich.

11:06.602 --> 11:08.354
Hi, sweetheart.

11:08.882 --> 11:10.156
How are things?

11:10.522 --> 11:13.673
Jim, it's happening.
They're talking college.

11:14.802 --> 11:16.394
We knew we had to face this
sooner or later.

11:16.562 --> 11:19.360
Yeah, well. I just wish it were later.

11:21.322 --> 11:23.040
Hi, kids. How's it going?

11:23.202 --> 11:25.033
We're talking futures here, Dad.

11:25.202 --> 11:27.352
All right, Dad,
what's your dream college for me?

11:27.762 --> 11:31.277
Well, there's a lot of good colleges
that are...

11:31.562 --> 11:32.915
Jim.

11:33.082 --> 11:34.071
What's the matter?

11:35.402 --> 11:38.792
Well, your mother and I've
figured a few things out.

11:38.962 --> 11:40.156
A few financial things

11:42.562 --> 11:44.473
Boy, I don't know why
this is so hard for me to say.

11:44.882 --> 11:46.998
- Just say it, Dad.
- Well,

11:47.882 --> 11:50.271
with business being a little slow,

11:50.442 --> 11:52.910
recession, and a few other factors,

11:53.082 --> 11:55.596
we realised that we can only afford
to send one of you

11:55.762 --> 11:58.196
to an expensive, out-of-state college.

12:00.082 --> 12:02.277
- You're kidding.
- We wish we were.

12:02.442 --> 12:03.921
Honey, when we moved here
from Minnesota,

12:04.082 --> 12:06.642
we had to put a big chunk
of our savings into this house.

12:06.802 --> 12:07.917
Our other investments
went south.

12:08.082 --> 12:10.835
And with college tuition running up
to $20,000 a year...

12:11.002 --> 12:13.232
Plus room and board, times two,

12:13.402 --> 12:15.518
we don't have that kind of money
lying around right now.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.560
Well, what about financial aid?

12:18.602 --> 12:20.194
That's the Catch-22.

12:20.362 --> 12:23.240
We're too rich for financial aid
and we're too poor for it not to matter.

12:23.402 --> 12:24.596
So, what are you gonna do?

12:24.762 --> 12:26.639
Which one of us
is gonna be able to go?

12:26.802 --> 12:29.362
Well, I think the best thing to do
is put our heads together

12:29.522 --> 12:32.559
and try and come up with some fair
and equitable solution.

12:32.722 --> 12:34.872
Why should I take a back seat,
because I'm a girl?

12:35.042 --> 12:37.351
- Brenda.
- That is totally bogus and you know it.

12:37.522 --> 12:38.671
- Brandon.
- No, I don't know it.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.560
It has nothing to do
with whether you're a girl.

12:40.722 --> 12:42.474
It has to do with you
getting a free ride.

12:42.642 --> 12:44.872
- Cut it out, guys.
- No, Dad.

12:45.042 --> 12:46.680
You've always gotten
everything you've wanted

12:46.842 --> 12:48.673
one way or the other.
And I've never said anything.

12:48.842 --> 12:50.434
But this time I won't allow it.

12:50.602 --> 12:51.796
What? You won't allow it?

12:51.962 --> 12:54.237
Let's just take a look at the record here
for a minute, okay?

12:54.882 --> 12:57.350
Who's the guy around here who's been
working since he was a sophomore

12:57.522 --> 12:59.752
- never asks Mom and Dad for a dime?
- Oh, get over yourself.

12:59.922 --> 13:01.799
Hey, guys. Just cut it out.

13:01.962 --> 13:03.759
This is hard enough for us.

13:04.322 --> 13:06.313
Now, I thought that we could
discuss this as a family,

13:06.482 --> 13:07.835
but I guess I was wrong.

13:08.002 --> 13:09.640
Now, your mother and I
will talk this over

13:09.802 --> 13:12.521
and we'll give you our decision
at the end of the week.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.354
Come on, Bren,
you know as well as I do,

13:25.522 --> 13:26.955
Mom and Dad
are gonna give it to you.

13:27.122 --> 13:29.477
- I don't always get what I want.
- Yes, you do.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.837
It's a fact of life I've come to accept.

13:32.002 --> 13:33.321
Brandon, that is not true.

13:33.482 --> 13:35.473
They've been easier on you
ever since we were little.

13:35.642 --> 13:36.791
Oh, really?

13:36.962 --> 13:39.430
Remember when I crashed Mondale
and they wouldn't let me drive

13:39.602 --> 13:41.957
- and then I had to buy my own car?
- What'd you expect?

13:42.122 --> 13:45.353
"Here's a new car, Brandon. This
time try not to drive it into a truck?"

13:45.522 --> 13:48.719
You lie to them, you run off to Mexico
with your boyfriend here

13:48.882 --> 13:51.476
and they reward you with a trip
to Paris. What's that?

13:51.642 --> 13:52.631
All right, time-out.

13:52.802 --> 13:55.600
When the bell rings, go to your
neutral corners and chill out.

13:55.762 --> 13:58.117
Yeah, Brandon, you should really try
and chill out.

14:00.602 --> 14:03.275
You guys are blowing this way out of
proportion I'm telling you right now.

14:03.442 --> 14:06.002
Oh, that's easy for you to say,
you're rich.

14:09.522 --> 14:12.320
Haven't you ever even thought of
where you'd like to go to college?

14:12.482 --> 14:14.074
I didn't think there was any point.

14:14.242 --> 14:16.710
I mean, maybe if my learning disability
had been found sooner,

14:16.882 --> 14:19.032
I could've done better in my classes.

14:19.202 --> 14:20.430
But it's too late now.

14:20.602 --> 14:22.354
I couldn't disagree with you more,
Donna.

14:22.802 --> 14:25.032
There's dozens of fine colleges
with special programmes

14:25.202 --> 14:27.397
for people with all sorts
of learning disabilities.

14:27.802 --> 14:28.791
I know.

14:28.962 --> 14:30.873
And have you spoken
with your parents about this?

14:31.282 --> 14:33.477
- Yes.
- And?

14:34.242 --> 14:36.437
And they seem to think

14:36.602 --> 14:39.480
that Beverly Hills Community College
is the place for me.

14:39.642 --> 14:43.112
Well, there's nothing wrong with that,
but there are lots of other options.

14:43.282 --> 14:44.397
Unless money's a problem.

14:44.562 --> 14:47.156
No, it has nothing to do with money,
Mrs. Teasley.

14:47.922 --> 14:49.514
It's just...

14:49.682 --> 14:52.879
I don't think my father really believes
I have a learning disability.

14:53.042 --> 14:55.510
- Well, why do you think that?
- I don't know.

14:55.922 --> 14:58.994
I guess he just figures
I'm not too smart.

15:00.322 --> 15:03.075
They just figure
I'll major in shopping anyway.

15:03.242 --> 15:04.880
They're probably right.

15:14.002 --> 15:16.994
Steve, I'm having flashbacks.

15:17.162 --> 15:18.959
Enjoy it. Use it.

15:19.122 --> 15:21.920
You don't understand.
I can't work. I can't concentrate.

15:22.082 --> 15:26.473
All I can think about is Kelly naked
and glistening wherever I go.

15:26.642 --> 15:29.679
Yeah, well, I know the visual on that
is pretty mind-blowing.

15:29.842 --> 15:31.594
But look,
bask in the glow of the moment

15:31.762 --> 15:33.434
- and move on with your life.
- Hey, guys.

15:33.602 --> 15:34.637
- Hey, Brandon.
- Hey.

15:34.802 --> 15:36.758
Big Dave's stressing because
he can't get the visual

15:36.922 --> 15:38.594
of Kelly Taylor in the buff
out of his mind.

15:38.762 --> 15:41.640
- The infamous shower scene.
- You know about that too?

15:41.802 --> 15:44.032
- Silver, you're a celebrity.
- Don't sweat it.

15:44.202 --> 15:45.874
Guys undress girls in their mind
all the time.

15:46.042 --> 15:47.760
- All the time.
- It's no biggie.

15:47.922 --> 15:49.196
Like that one.

15:52.322 --> 15:54.597
You guys, that's Sue Scanlon,
Scott's little sister.

15:54.762 --> 15:57.720
I've known her since I was 4.
I can't look at her.

15:58.762 --> 16:01.117
- Hi, David.
- Hi, Sue.

16:02.482 --> 16:05.440
Excuse me, guys.
I couldn't help but overhear.

16:05.602 --> 16:08.878
Have you guys ever, you know,

16:09.482 --> 16:11.040
undressed me in your minds?

16:11.202 --> 16:12.396
I'm doing it right now.

16:13.242 --> 16:15.039
Andrea, you look fabulous.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.557
Does a burger come
with that shake?

16:25.562 --> 16:27.120
Hi, Andrea.

16:27.442 --> 16:30.514
- Mr. Meyers.
- Andrea, call me Gil, please.

16:30.682 --> 16:33.754
Whatever.
Were you ever in the circus?

16:34.322 --> 16:35.391
What?

16:36.882 --> 16:40.079
Did you ever
run off and join the circus?

16:40.242 --> 16:41.755
No.

16:41.922 --> 16:45.153
- But I ran off and went to Yale.
- You did?

16:45.322 --> 16:48.359
Well, I'm thinking of applying
to their early admissions programme.

16:48.522 --> 16:51.195
- Just thinking about it.
- Really?

16:51.362 --> 16:53.956
- Well, good luck.
- What do you mean good luck?

16:54.122 --> 16:56.556
Are you saying
that I shouldn't apply?

16:56.722 --> 16:59.998
No, not at all.
It's just that they're very selective.

17:00.162 --> 17:04.838
Well, don't you think I have
as good a chance as anyone else?

17:05.002 --> 17:05.991
Of course you do.

17:06.162 --> 17:10.519
I'm just saying that you might not want
to put all your eggs in one basket.

17:13.842 --> 17:16.310
- Oh, he hates me.
- He doesn't hate you.

17:16.482 --> 17:18.837
He was just being realistic.
Yale's a tough school.

17:19.002 --> 17:20.878
Brandon, he was discouraging me
from even trying.

17:21.041 --> 17:24.079
- He never does that with you.
- Let's not get into that again, okay?

17:24.242 --> 17:25.993
Oh, yeah, let's not.
Don't wanna rock the boat.

17:26.162 --> 17:28.596
Andrea, you're not
the only person around here

17:28.762 --> 17:31.913
- with college problems, all right?
- What are you talking about?

17:32.082 --> 17:34.357
Let me put it this way,
money doesn't exactly grow on trees

17:34.522 --> 17:37.082
- around my house, either.
- I thought your dad was doing fine.

17:37.242 --> 17:39.802
He is, but with two of us
to contend with, it ain't easy.

17:39.962 --> 17:41.190
So, what are you gonna do?

17:41.882 --> 17:43.600
I don't know.

17:47.082 --> 17:48.674
I must say,
it's wonderful to have a student

17:48.842 --> 17:50.719
who's actually zeroed in
on what he wants.

17:50.882 --> 17:54.113
Well, USC is <i>numero uno.</i>
In fact, it's the only <i>numero.</i>

17:54.282 --> 17:57.433
It's a tradition with my family.
My father was an alumni there,

17:57.602 --> 17:59.797
- so was my uncle.
- Well, that'll certainly help.

18:00.282 --> 18:03.240
But you'll need a little more
than a legacy to get accepted.

18:03.842 --> 18:05.594
I know this isn't cool to say,
Mrs. Teasley,

18:05.762 --> 18:08.276
but we got the bucks.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.077
I'm referring to your grade point
average, Steven,

18:12.242 --> 18:13.675
not your bank account.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.114
You have a D+ average.

18:18.242 --> 18:19.721
Really?

18:20.122 --> 18:21.271
I thought I had a C-.

18:22.962 --> 18:25.681
Now, I'm not saying
USC is out of the question,

18:25.842 --> 18:27.958
but unless you start
putting a few more A's into the mix

18:28.122 --> 18:30.955
you'd better start thinking about
<i>numero dos.</i>

18:35.242 --> 18:36.834
Kelly, wait up.

18:37.002 --> 18:39.038
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

18:39.202 --> 18:40.681
How about a lift home?

18:40.842 --> 18:44.312
So you can stare at me while I drive?
I don't think so.

18:44.602 --> 18:46.320
- Kelly, wait.
- What?

18:46.482 --> 18:48.552
What is going on with you?

18:48.962 --> 18:50.953
Nothing. I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:51.122 --> 18:52.680
Kelly, I know you.

18:52.842 --> 18:54.878
You haven't been yourself lately.
Something's wrong.

18:55.042 --> 18:58.079
Something more than David
walking in on you in the shower.

18:58.322 --> 19:01.155
- What gave it away?
- Kelly, I'm your best friend.

19:01.322 --> 19:04.041
I've never seen you so down
for so long.

19:04.202 --> 19:07.478
I don't know.
Maybe it's all the college stuff.

19:08.162 --> 19:10.995
I just can't get into it. I don't know
what college I want to go to.

19:11.162 --> 19:14.791
And I have no idea what I wanna do
for the rest of my life.

19:15.522 --> 19:18.992
- I just feel kind of useless.
- Why didn't you say something to me?

19:19.522 --> 19:21.752
Because you seemed so excited
about everything.

19:21.922 --> 19:23.275
I didn't want to bring you down.

19:23.442 --> 19:26.002
Kelly, I feel really bad.
Is there anything that I can do?

19:27.842 --> 19:29.958
Well, if we hurry, we can catch
a movie in Westwood.

19:30.122 --> 19:31.111
We can hang out tonight.

19:31.282 --> 19:33.512
I can't,
I'm supposed to go to Dylan's later.

19:34.442 --> 19:36.080
Hey, do you wanna come?

19:36.242 --> 19:39.075
No, that's okay. Three's a crowd.

19:42.362 --> 19:44.398
I just feel so helpless,
I mean, Kelly's my best friend.

19:44.562 --> 19:47.201
I can't just sit by and watch her
get more and more depressed.

19:47.362 --> 19:49.193
Well, I'm sure she knows
you mean well, Bren.

19:49.362 --> 19:50.795
Hand me that socket wrench.

19:50.962 --> 19:52.998
Dylan, we're talking about
Kelly's future.

19:53.162 --> 19:55.278
No, Bren, we're not. You are.

19:55.882 --> 19:57.281
That one.

19:57.682 --> 19:59.195
And what does that mean?

19:59.362 --> 20:01.796
I mean, maybe Kelly
doesn't want to go to college.

20:01.962 --> 20:03.554
Of course she does.
Everybody does.

20:03.922 --> 20:06.561
Not everybody, Bren.
I don't want to, I'm not going.

20:06.922 --> 20:08.435
I can't believe you're saying that.

20:08.602 --> 20:10.399
I told you that a long time ago.

20:10.562 --> 20:12.120
But I didn't think you really meant it.

20:12.282 --> 20:14.637
Have you ever known me
to say anything I didn't mean?

20:14.802 --> 20:16.952
Dylan, you're just doing this
to get back at your father.

20:17.882 --> 20:20.954
I don't do things
to get back at people, Brenda.

20:22.562 --> 20:23.756
I know.

20:23.922 --> 20:25.150
I shouldn't have said that.

20:25.322 --> 20:27.233
No, you shouldn't have.

20:27.762 --> 20:30.515
I just assumed that we would both
be going to the same college.

20:30.962 --> 20:32.634
Hand me the feeler gauge, will you?

20:33.322 --> 20:35.119
What does it look like?

20:35.282 --> 20:37.637
It looks like a pocketknife.

20:38.322 --> 20:40.961
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

20:43.602 --> 20:44.921
So, what about us?

20:45.522 --> 20:47.274
And what if I go away to college?

20:47.442 --> 20:50.673
Well, we'll cross that bridge
when the time comes.

20:52.562 --> 20:54.951
I'll be done here in a second.
Do you wanna go for a ride?

20:55.122 --> 20:56.521
No, I hate motorcycles.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.391
Besides, we're talking about
something serious, Dylan.

21:00.882 --> 21:03.840
Look, Bren, do me a favour, okay?

21:04.002 --> 21:05.799
I don't want you or anybody else
for that matter,

21:05.962 --> 21:07.759
trying to plan my future.

21:13.042 --> 21:15.510
I know that Dylan has the right to do
whatever he wants.

21:15.682 --> 21:18.640
But can't you talk to him,
explain how important college is?

21:18.802 --> 21:21.396
Brenda, the best way to ensure
that Dylan never goes to college

21:21.562 --> 21:22.961
is for me to tell him to go.

21:23.122 --> 21:25.033
But, Dad, he might be throwing
his whole life away.

21:25.202 --> 21:26.237
We have to do something.

21:26.962 --> 21:29.157
Now, don't take this the wrong way,

21:29.362 --> 21:32.035
but has it ever occurred to you
that maybe you and Dylan

21:32.202 --> 21:34.033
are beginning to move
in two different directions?

21:34.202 --> 21:36.033
I can't believe
you're starting this again.

21:36.202 --> 21:39.000
Honey, you asked me to take
your relationship with Dylan seriously.

21:39.162 --> 21:42.074
- That's exactly what I'm doing.
- Oh, by trying to break us up?

21:42.242 --> 21:44.710
I'm not trying to break you up.
Not in any way.

21:44.882 --> 21:46.281
But let me ask you something.

21:46.442 --> 21:47.761
What were you and Dylan
doing tonight

21:47.922 --> 21:49.480
when you should have been
studying?

21:50.202 --> 21:51.840
- Dad.
- Well?

21:52.002 --> 21:54.470
Look, it's not what you think.
He was fixing his motorcycle.

21:54.922 --> 21:57.311
- Exactly my point.
- Which is?

21:58.082 --> 22:02.678
Dylan is a young man with,
as far as I can tell,

22:02.842 --> 22:06.152
absolutely no goals
and no ambition whatsoever.

22:06.322 --> 22:08.358
- Dad.
- I'm not trying to be harsh.

22:08.522 --> 22:09.671
I'm being realistic.

22:09.842 --> 22:12.561
You have to ask yourself
who would he be without his money?

22:13.162 --> 22:16.313
A kind, caring, sensitive person.

22:16.482 --> 22:17.961
The person that I love.

22:19.282 --> 22:21.352
That may well be.

22:21.522 --> 22:22.921
But we're talking about the future.

22:23.282 --> 22:25.512
I mean, look, you and your brother
are at each other's throats

22:25.682 --> 22:26.910
about what college to go to.

22:27.082 --> 22:29.312
And all Dylan seems to want
is to spend the rest of his life

22:29.482 --> 22:32.554
surfing at the beach
and tinkering with his motorcycle.

22:32.882 --> 22:35.919
You have to ask yourself,
is that what you want?

22:45.562 --> 22:47.359
Hello, anybody home?

22:47.522 --> 22:49.353
Hi, honey, how was work?

22:49.522 --> 22:51.035
Greasy.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.356
So where are the troops?

22:53.522 --> 22:56.036
Oh, your dad's upstairs
talking to Brenda.

22:56.202 --> 22:57.794
Oh, really?

22:58.362 --> 23:01.320
Did Dad need to talk to Brenda
or did Brenda need to talk to Dad?

23:01.482 --> 23:03.200
- Well...
- Unbelievable.

23:03.922 --> 23:05.355
She's gonna win. She always does.

23:05.522 --> 23:07.240
What are you talking about?

23:07.402 --> 23:09.552
You know, Mom, it seems
going to some fancy college

23:09.722 --> 23:11.599
means a whole lot more to Brenda
than it does to me.

23:11.762 --> 23:13.992
I'm going to make everyone's life
around here a little easier.

23:14.162 --> 23:16.073
I'm gonna apply
to California University,

23:16.242 --> 23:17.721
which is cheap and right here in L.A.

23:17.882 --> 23:19.998
And my second choice'll be
the University of Minnesota.

23:20.162 --> 23:21.515
And I'll even use
Grandma's address

23:21.682 --> 23:23.752
so you and Dad don't have to pay
out-of-state tuition

23:23.922 --> 23:25.514
and everyone will be happy.

23:25.682 --> 23:27.195
Brandon.

23:29.522 --> 23:31.717
Just because Brandon says
he'll go to a state school

23:31.882 --> 23:33.554
doesn't mean he wants to.

23:33.722 --> 23:36.236
He's just giving up, Jim.
You know how he is.

23:36.402 --> 23:39.838
Well, isn't that better than them
being at each other's throats?

23:40.002 --> 23:41.993
But that's not the point.

23:43.762 --> 23:46.196
You know, sometimes I really think

23:46.362 --> 23:50.401
Brandon does deserve it more
because he has worked so hard.

23:50.562 --> 23:53.440
Brandon worked because
he wanted extra money to buy a car.

23:53.602 --> 23:57.038
Brenda didn't.
She shouldn't be penalised for that.

23:57.402 --> 24:00.121
I hate being in this position.

24:00.922 --> 24:02.071
Jim...

24:04.042 --> 24:06.795
...what about taking out
a second mortgage on the house?

24:06.962 --> 24:09.681
Honey, you know what you're
talking about? Living in debt.

24:09.842 --> 24:13.073
Always having that thing hanging
over us. We said we'd never do that.

24:14.882 --> 24:17.601
But, how are we
ever gonna choose?

24:19.002 --> 24:20.833
I don't know.

24:21.002 --> 24:23.232
I feel like I'm walking a tightrope.

24:27.162 --> 24:28.834
Go for it, Andrea.

24:29.002 --> 24:31.118
Brandon, what are you doing here?

24:31.442 --> 24:33.194
I'm always in your dreams, aren't I?

24:33.762 --> 24:35.878
I don't know if I can do this.

24:36.682 --> 24:37.831
It's Meyers, isn't it?

24:38.162 --> 24:39.595
Why are you letting
that guy rattle you?

24:39.762 --> 24:42.322
- He went to Yale, remember?
- So what?

24:42.482 --> 24:43.915
He's not in charge of admissions.

24:45.202 --> 24:46.601
I know.

24:48.242 --> 24:49.231
What should I do?

24:49.402 --> 24:51.154
You should go for what you want,
Andrea.

24:51.682 --> 24:54.594
Don't let Gil Meyers or anybody else
stand in your way.

24:55.042 --> 24:57.840
- You think so?
- Come on.

24:58.282 --> 25:00.000
It's showtime.

25:10.322 --> 25:12.358
- Mr. Meyers, what are you doing?
- Hey.

25:13.602 --> 25:16.070
I thought I was the only guy
in your dreams?

25:16.442 --> 25:18.194
Why do you keep haunting me?

25:18.362 --> 25:20.114
Really, Andrea.

25:20.282 --> 25:23.592
I didn't know
I had that kind of effect on you.

25:28.202 --> 25:30.557
No!

25:54.522 --> 25:56.717
What took you so long
to come to your senses, big guy?

25:56.882 --> 25:58.952
Just give me the key, will you?

26:00.802 --> 26:03.680
And so the torch is passed.

26:03.842 --> 26:07.994
At this time next year,
you'll be pledging our fraternity.

26:08.162 --> 26:09.754
Is this really the master key
to the school?

26:09.922 --> 26:14.632
Every office, every filing cabinet,
every grade bank.

26:16.082 --> 26:18.312
The legacy is in your hands now,
Steve.

26:18.882 --> 26:20.395
Guard it with your life.

27:01.842 --> 27:03.195
Damn.

27:08.402 --> 27:11.519
Steve, what dragged you out of bed
on this fine Beverly Hills morning?

27:11.682 --> 27:13.115
I'm meeting B.J. for breakfast.

27:13.282 --> 27:16.718
Oh, yeah, sure, he's over there.
I'll take your order in a minute.

27:20.322 --> 27:22.756
B, just tell me one thing,
was this a solo operation

27:22.922 --> 27:24.560
or was the whole fraternity
involved in it?

27:24.722 --> 27:26.838
What have you been putting
in your granola, Sanders?

27:27.282 --> 27:28.476
It was a real funny joke.

27:28.642 --> 27:31.156
You tell the guys back at the house
that I really went for the bait.

27:32.562 --> 27:34.234
You sent me on a wild goose chase,
man.

27:34.402 --> 27:38.554
Hey, lame brain. I gave you
the West Beverly Legacy Key.

27:38.722 --> 27:41.634
The same key that was given to me,
and the guy before me,

27:41.802 --> 27:44.032
- and the guy before him.
- Then why didn't it work?

27:44.642 --> 27:46.439
I don't know.
Maybe they changed the locks.

27:46.602 --> 27:48.240
Did you ever think of that one,
Einstein?

27:50.682 --> 27:53.879
Now remember, relative size
is the key to perspective.

27:54.042 --> 27:56.556
And don't hold back, please.

27:56.722 --> 28:00.715
Learning to draw is a blending
of technique and spirituality.

28:00.882 --> 28:04.033
If she starts passing out crystals,
I'm out of here.

28:04.562 --> 28:05.995
Excuse me.

28:06.482 --> 28:08.040
Oh, much better, Nikki.

28:08.202 --> 28:10.557
Just let it happen. You're welcome.

28:12.442 --> 28:15.514
Donna, you have
a very graceful stroke.

28:15.682 --> 28:16.751
Where have you trained?

28:16.922 --> 28:19.914
- Nowhere. I just like to draw.
- Well, then you should.

28:20.242 --> 28:21.834
- Should what?
- Train.

28:22.002 --> 28:23.833
Have you ever thought about
going to art school?

28:26.722 --> 28:27.791
Are you serious?

28:27.962 --> 28:29.395
- May I?
- Okay.

28:30.322 --> 28:31.914
People,

28:32.162 --> 28:34.960
this is the work of an artist.

28:38.842 --> 28:41.914
Can you believe this? If this happens,
this will be so incredible.

28:42.082 --> 28:44.152
I mean, I've never really thought
about art school before.

28:44.322 --> 28:45.357
But since she said it...

28:45.522 --> 28:46.955
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, Bren,

28:47.122 --> 28:49.192
- I have got the greatest news.
- What?

28:49.362 --> 28:50.556
Ms. Signorelli, she said

28:50.722 --> 28:52.872
she thinks I should apply
to the College of Art and Design.

28:53.042 --> 28:54.634
I told her drawing
was just a hobby for me,

28:54.802 --> 28:56.315
but she said
not with the right training.

28:56.482 --> 28:58.950
She wants me to make a portfolio
and she's going to help me with it.

28:59.122 --> 29:02.831
Isn't that the best? Oh, I have got to go
tell Mrs. Teasley, bye.

29:03.002 --> 29:05.072
- Bye, Donna.
- What was that all about?

29:05.242 --> 29:07.119
Something about
nurturing raw talent.

29:07.282 --> 29:10.479
- Kelly, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

29:12.522 --> 29:14.478
So, what's up?

29:14.802 --> 29:17.475
Kelly, do you think Dylan and I
have anything in common?

29:17.642 --> 29:19.041
Where did that come from?

29:19.202 --> 29:20.521
From my dad.
We had a talk last night

29:20.682 --> 29:22.513
and a couple things he said
really got to me.

29:22.682 --> 29:25.799
I mean, lately, it's like Dylan and I
are on two different wavelengths.

29:25.962 --> 29:27.714
In what way?

29:27.962 --> 29:30.556
Well, for starters, I go over
to his house to talk about college

29:30.722 --> 29:32.553
and all he wants to do
is work on his motorcycle.

29:32.722 --> 29:34.952
Brenda, he's your boyfriend,
not your Siamese twin.

29:35.122 --> 29:37.272
You guys can lead separate lives
and still go out.

29:37.442 --> 29:40.514
I know. It's just that
Dylan's not very ambitious.

29:40.682 --> 29:42.513
I guess he doesn't have to be
with all that money.

29:42.682 --> 29:44.081
Is that a problem for you?

29:44.242 --> 29:46.358
I didn't think it was
until my dad mentioned it.

29:46.522 --> 29:48.194
Well, have you talked to Dylan
about it?

29:48.562 --> 29:49.836
No, not yet.

29:50.202 --> 29:51.271
Why not?

29:51.922 --> 29:53.719
Because what if my father's right?

29:58.882 --> 30:00.395
Isn't that your sister over there?

30:00.562 --> 30:02.632
Yeah, we're not on speaking terms
today.

30:02.802 --> 30:05.111
I used to get in fights all the time
with my brothers and sisters

30:05.282 --> 30:07.034
when I lived in San Francisco.

30:07.202 --> 30:09.079
It's a drag, isn't it?

30:09.682 --> 30:11.035
I don't know.

30:11.202 --> 30:12.840
I kind of miss it.

30:13.162 --> 30:15.801
You're one sick puppy,
you know that.

30:16.562 --> 30:20.475
So why are you and your sister
not on speaking terms?

30:20.642 --> 30:22.951
Oh, there was a minor incident
at Casa Walsh yesterday

30:23.122 --> 30:26.000
in regards to who gets to go away
to college and who doesn't.

30:26.162 --> 30:30.075
Brenda went for the kill
and lobbied my dad behind my back.

30:30.242 --> 30:33.393
I'm sure glad
I don't have to worry about that yet.

30:33.842 --> 30:35.275
Besides, what's the big deal?

30:35.442 --> 30:39.196
I mean, isn't California University one
of the best colleges in the country?

30:39.362 --> 30:40.511
Yeah.

30:40.682 --> 30:42.001
So maybe
you ought to think about it.

30:42.162 --> 30:43.800
I don't want to start going out
with a senior

30:43.962 --> 30:46.476
just before he goes away to school.

30:47.642 --> 30:48.711
We're going out, are we?

30:48.882 --> 30:50.838
If I have anything to say about it.

30:51.962 --> 30:54.192
Something tells me you do.

31:00.042 --> 31:01.521
Brandon.

31:02.002 --> 31:04.038
Bren, I got a lot of work to do.

31:04.202 --> 31:05.521
Well, I just wanted to let you know

31:05.682 --> 31:08.242
that you can go away to school
if you want.

31:08.562 --> 31:10.154
Hold it.

31:11.202 --> 31:12.555
What happened?

31:14.682 --> 31:16.081
Nothing.

31:16.242 --> 31:19.518
I just had some time to think and
decided that maybe you were right.

31:19.682 --> 31:21.354
Maybe you do deserve it
more than I do.

31:22.322 --> 31:23.960
Bren, you and I
both know you're not doing this

31:24.122 --> 31:26.158
out of the goodness of your heart.

31:26.882 --> 31:28.873
Something else is going on
and I wanna know what it is.

31:29.322 --> 31:31.119
It's not a what.

31:31.442 --> 31:32.557
It's a who.

31:39.122 --> 31:40.316
Yeah?

31:40.482 --> 31:41.915
<i>Hi.</i>

31:42.562 --> 31:43.915
Hi.

31:44.882 --> 31:46.156
<i>What are you doing?</i>

31:46.322 --> 31:49.041
I'm just waxing the bike.

31:51.762 --> 31:54.322
Dylan, I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

31:55.122 --> 31:57.192
I wasn't trying to plan your future.

31:57.362 --> 31:58.841
<i>Yeah?</i>

31:59.282 --> 32:00.874
I guess I was just scared.

32:02.202 --> 32:03.601
Scared of what?

32:04.402 --> 32:06.279
Well, it's hard to think
about going away to college

32:06.442 --> 32:07.591
and you not being there.

32:08.122 --> 32:10.556
Maybe you'll give me
those frequent visitation rights.

32:11.602 --> 32:13.513
Yeah, well,
you won't have to travel far.

32:14.722 --> 32:16.838
I'm not going away.
I'm going to school in L.A.

32:17.082 --> 32:19.915
Bren, are you doing this
because of us?

32:20.082 --> 32:23.154
Well, Dylan, our relationship
hasn't exactly thrived long-distance.

32:23.962 --> 32:25.873
Don't plan your life around me.

32:26.042 --> 32:29.034
But you're a part of my life.
I thought I was part of yours too.

32:29.402 --> 32:32.519
Yes, you are. You're a big part.

32:32.682 --> 32:34.957
But if you don't do this for yourself,
you're gonna resent me.

32:35.122 --> 32:36.396
And I don't want that.

32:39.042 --> 32:40.873
Hold on a sec.

32:46.682 --> 32:47.751
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:47.922 --> 32:48.957
Is it a bad time?

32:49.122 --> 32:50.316
No.

32:50.482 --> 32:52.677
- I can go.
- Come on in.

32:55.122 --> 32:57.033
- Brenda?
- Hey, what happened?

32:58.322 --> 33:01.314
Nothing, I gotta take care
of something, can I call you back?

33:01.482 --> 33:02.471
Yeah, sure.

33:02.842 --> 33:04.833
Think about what I said.

33:05.002 --> 33:06.151
I will.

33:06.322 --> 33:07.960
And Dylan,

33:08.402 --> 33:09.881
I love you.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.596
I love you.

33:25.682 --> 33:28.071
So tell me, Kel, what brings you by?

33:28.242 --> 33:30.312
Do I need an excuse?

33:30.922 --> 33:33.038
I saw your lights were on.

33:33.682 --> 33:35.161
Brenda said
you were working on your bike.

33:35.322 --> 33:37.438
- It looks great.
- Thanks.

33:38.082 --> 33:40.880
Listen, I found these wrenches
in my garage.

33:41.042 --> 33:43.272
One of my stepdads
must've left them behind.

33:43.442 --> 33:45.831
God knows Mel doesn't know
what to do with tools, so here.

33:46.002 --> 33:48.391
- I thought maybe you can use them.
- Thank you.

33:48.882 --> 33:52.113
You know, I've been moping around
for the past few weeks.

33:52.282 --> 33:54.318
Yeah, I noticed.

33:54.482 --> 33:56.916
I thought it was just college stuff.

33:57.082 --> 34:00.233
But the truth is I miss our friendship.

34:01.962 --> 34:05.079
I mean, I keep avoiding you.
But why should I?

34:05.562 --> 34:08.793
If I want to talk to you, why do I need
an excuse like a set of wrenches?

34:09.161 --> 34:10.993
It's a very nice set of wrenches.

34:11.922 --> 34:14.482
It's like, you and I are the only
two people in the whole school

34:14.641 --> 34:17.600
who haven't gone completely manic
about this whole college thing.

34:18.242 --> 34:21.040
Well, I think that's because
we both have a pretty good idea

34:21.202 --> 34:22.396
of what we don't want.

34:22.562 --> 34:25.474
And in my book that's just as important
as knowing what you do want.

34:27.121 --> 34:29.795
So am I ever gonna get to ride
this thing?

34:31.842 --> 34:33.195
I think so.

34:34.081 --> 34:36.232
I'll see you tomorrow, Dylan.

34:45.681 --> 34:47.592
- Hello.
- <i>Hi.</i>

34:47.762 --> 34:49.161
Hi. Is everything okay?

34:49.322 --> 34:50.675
Yeah.

34:51.242 --> 34:53.960
Bren, we're gonna make it
through this.

34:54.121 --> 34:55.110
I hope so.

34:55.282 --> 34:58.831
We will, I just don't want you to
miss out on anything because of me.

34:59.002 --> 35:00.993
<i>Dylan, if I stay here</i>
<i>I won't miss anything.</i>

35:01.162 --> 35:03.471
I'll have everything I want.

35:04.322 --> 35:05.914
- I'm on the phone.
- Yeah, well, get off.

35:06.082 --> 35:07.276
Mom and Dad
are waiting downstairs

35:07.442 --> 35:09.831
to have another one of their
family discussions.

35:10.002 --> 35:11.401
I have to go.

35:12.682 --> 35:14.161
I love you, Bren.

35:14.322 --> 35:16.278
I love you too.

35:20.042 --> 35:21.316
Well,

35:21.482 --> 35:23.677
we've looked at this
from every angle possible.

35:23.842 --> 35:25.195
And a few that weren't.

35:25.362 --> 35:26.795
And it always came down
to one thing.

35:27.322 --> 35:29.040
How do we choose
between our children?

35:29.202 --> 35:31.397
And the answer is we don't.

35:32.562 --> 35:33.551
That's why we've decided

35:33.722 --> 35:36.759
that the two of you should be looking at
any school you want to go to.

35:36.922 --> 35:38.833
And your mother and I
will do anything we can to help.

35:39.962 --> 35:42.795
Wait a minute. Did someone win
the lottery around here?

35:42.962 --> 35:43.951
No.

35:44.122 --> 35:46.352
Somebody's taking out
a second mortgage on our house.

35:46.522 --> 35:48.194
So we'll die in debt.

35:48.362 --> 35:49.351
It's the American way.

35:49.842 --> 35:51.241
Thanks, guys.

35:51.402 --> 35:52.835
But you're not gonna have
to do that.

35:53.242 --> 35:54.595
- We're not?
- No.

35:54.962 --> 35:56.793
I decided to go to college right here.

35:56.962 --> 35:57.951
You did?

35:58.122 --> 35:59.714
Well, ever since we moved
to Beverly Hills

35:59.882 --> 36:01.873
I've been dreaming
of going to California University.

36:02.642 --> 36:04.678
I guess I just got wrapped up
in all the excitement.

36:06.282 --> 36:08.512
So, Brandon, I guess it's up to you.

36:08.682 --> 36:11.515
Now that you have all those
thousands of dollars at your fingertips,

36:11.682 --> 36:13.274
where are you gonna apply?

36:15.082 --> 36:16.435
California University.

36:16.602 --> 36:17.637
- What?
- What?

36:17.802 --> 36:21.033
Well, when I found out I might have
to settle for a state school,

36:21.202 --> 36:23.557
I did a little research of my own.

36:23.722 --> 36:25.235
Found out I wouldn't have
to settle at all.

36:25.402 --> 36:27.916
California University's one
of the best schools in the country

36:28.082 --> 36:30.437
and they do publish
an award-winning college newspaper.

36:30.602 --> 36:33.070
And their theatre and film department
is one of the top ten.

36:33.242 --> 36:35.437
Well, I don't know whether
to be incredibly happy,

36:35.602 --> 36:37.718
or incredibly angry
that you put us through all of this,

36:37.882 --> 36:40.191
- or incredibly relieved...
- Jim.

36:40.362 --> 36:41.511
Incredibly happy.

36:41.682 --> 36:42.956
I have a good idea.

36:43.482 --> 36:46.280
Why don't you guys take all the money
that you're saving on private college

36:46.442 --> 36:48.876
and give it to Brandon and me
for our high school graduation gifts?

36:49.042 --> 36:51.078
You see, now that's an idea.

36:52.522 --> 36:54.319
- Not.
- Not.

36:57.682 --> 37:01.834
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, may we call</i>
<i>your attention to the centre ring</i>

37:02.002 --> 37:04.470
<i>our daring guest for talent</i>
<i>is about to take her place</i>

37:04.642 --> 37:08.555
<i>high in the sky above the big top.</i>

37:09.802 --> 37:11.440
Hey, Andrea...

37:13.322 --> 37:15.882
...you're not gonna make it.

37:17.922 --> 37:19.674
Looks like you're slipping.

37:20.682 --> 37:22.513
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

37:29.562 --> 37:32.952
You can do it, you can do it,
you can do it, yeah.

37:33.122 --> 37:36.239
You can do it, you can do it...

37:50.322 --> 37:51.880
Mr. Meyers.

37:52.042 --> 37:55.512
Andrea, I didn't expect you
until later.

37:55.682 --> 37:57.752
Couldn't stay away, huh?

37:59.482 --> 38:02.633
Actually, I came here
to tell you something.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.035
No matter what you think,

38:05.202 --> 38:06.954
no matter how much you try
to shake my confidence

38:07.122 --> 38:08.601
I am still applying to Yale.

38:09.642 --> 38:13.078
And I'm doing it because I want to
and because...

38:13.242 --> 38:14.834
Because they would be lucky
to have me.

38:15.122 --> 38:17.158
And if I don't make it,
it won't be the end of the world

38:17.322 --> 38:21.281
because I'll know that I have tried.
Now, if you can't support that, fine.

38:21.962 --> 38:23.441
That's terrific.

38:24.882 --> 38:26.201
What?

38:26.362 --> 38:28.830
You're exactly the kind of person
Yale's looking for.

38:30.082 --> 38:31.481
Wait...

38:31.802 --> 38:33.633
Were you just testing me
the other day?

38:33.962 --> 38:38.717
Hey, if I'm gonna write a glowing letter
of recommendation for somebody,

38:38.882 --> 38:39.951
I'd better be sure.

38:40.562 --> 38:42.598
Do you have any idea
what you've put me through?

38:42.762 --> 38:46.311
I didn't know I had
that kind of effect on you.

38:53.402 --> 38:55.711
- Hey, what's up, Steve?
- Later, man.

40:20.282 --> 40:21.840
Forget your combination again, son?

40:22.882 --> 40:24.474
It's not what you think, l...

40:24.642 --> 40:26.598
Oh, no, I know what you're here for.

40:26.762 --> 40:29.151
You're not the first senior
who tried to get his hands on the key.

40:29.322 --> 40:31.882
Mr. Hutchins, I swear
I wasn't gonna do anything bad.

40:32.042 --> 40:33.111
Well, that's for sure.

40:33.282 --> 40:35.273
The only place that key on the wall
is gonna get you

40:35.442 --> 40:36.716
is into my RV in Oxnard.

40:36.882 --> 40:39.112
All you're gonna find in there
are a couple of fishing poles.

40:39.442 --> 40:40.955
This.

40:41.522 --> 40:44.082
This is what I believe
you were looking for.

40:44.482 --> 40:47.633
Look, just let me get out of here
and we'll forget about this whole thing.

40:47.802 --> 40:49.394
Now, that might be difficult, son.

40:49.562 --> 40:52.793
This is a serious offence. You could
get kicked out of school for this.

40:52.962 --> 40:54.998
Please, l...

40:55.962 --> 40:58.556
I'm graduating.
I don't want any trouble.

40:58.722 --> 40:59.996
You never thought about the trouble

41:00.162 --> 41:02.471
you could have gotten me into now,
did you?

41:02.722 --> 41:04.235
All right.

41:05.762 --> 41:06.751
What'll it take?

41:07.402 --> 41:08.471
What're you talking about?

41:12.242 --> 41:13.834
A c-note.

41:14.362 --> 41:15.636
We'll forget about the whole thing.

41:16.362 --> 41:18.239
This must be important to you.

41:18.722 --> 41:20.314
Very important.

41:21.402 --> 41:24.474
Well, I don't see why anyone
has to know about this.

41:25.602 --> 41:26.830
Thank you.

41:27.562 --> 41:29.553
You know, any more
where this come from

41:29.722 --> 41:32.634
you could buy yourself
a Legacy key.

41:35.082 --> 41:37.642
How did you know it was called
Legacy key?

41:37.802 --> 41:41.033
Like I said, you're not the first.

41:47.762 --> 41:50.959
There you are,
I've been looking for you.

41:51.322 --> 41:52.835
You have?

41:53.882 --> 41:55.918
I think I owe you an apology, David.

41:56.562 --> 41:58.314
- You do?
- Yeah.

41:58.482 --> 42:02.475
This whole new Taylor/Silver setup
has been a little weird for me too.

42:03.362 --> 42:05.956
Anyway, I've got some ideas,

42:06.122 --> 42:08.238
some bathroom scheduling,
stuff like that,

42:08.402 --> 42:10.472
to make things run
a little smoother around here.

42:10.642 --> 42:11.995
I can live with that.

42:12.162 --> 42:13.993
We're both gonna have to be
a lot more careful.

42:14.162 --> 42:15.880
Definitely, look,

42:16.042 --> 42:18.476
- seriously, it really was an accident.
- I know.

42:18.642 --> 42:20.872
And I've been giving you
a lot of grief.

42:21.042 --> 42:22.760
And I'm sorry.

42:23.322 --> 42:24.437
That's okay.

42:24.602 --> 42:26.001
No, it's not okay.

42:27.322 --> 42:30.951
And to prove to you how sorry I am,
I've got a very special,

42:31.122 --> 42:33.352
very private little treat for you
right now.

42:40.882 --> 42:42.793
Kelly, it's not necessary.

42:43.242 --> 42:45.437
Oh, but it is.

42:47.122 --> 42:48.475
Kelly.

42:53.242 --> 42:54.914
Pleasant dreams.
