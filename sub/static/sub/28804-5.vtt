11:42.542 --> 11:43.667

in the world.

11:46.625 --> 11:48.041
See, that's what I don't get.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.000
They got all the time
in the world to figure out

11:50.083 --> 11:51.500
mathematically precise ways
in which

11:51.583 --> 11:52.875
all these other pieces
move, right?

11:52.959 --> 11:55.917
Like, diagonal, L-shape,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.417
up and down,
two steps at a time.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.875

12:23.625 --> 12:26.041
(chuckles)
I was 13 or 14,

12:26.125 --> 12:28.000
and I was determined to go

12:28.083 --> 12:29.959
year-round without
wearing shoes,

12:30.041 --> 12:31.500
except they wouldn't
let me into church,

12:31.583 --> 12:33.834
and I loved going to church
as a child.

12:34.667 --> 12:37.834
(sighs) I'm a C-minus Christian,
but, you know, I am one.

12:37.917 --> 12:38.875
You?

12:39.500 --> 12:42.750
I don't really believe in all
that cosmic moral accounting.

12:42.834 --> 12:44.458

if such a thing as retribution
exists, well (scoffs)...

Aah, he took a swing at me.

13:05.041 --> 13:06.542

you can never admit

called me sweet.

Thumb turn.

49:58.709 --> 50:00.458
Yeah, and a new door, too.

50:00.542 --> 50:01.667
I don't know, a fucking door.

50:01.750 --> 50:03.709
He's got a whole
truck full of them.

50:04.667 --> 50:07.458
Then meet me at Franklin's
funeral home in 30.

50:08.083 --> 50:10.250
Just one. I'll explain.

50:11.583 --> 50:14.375
The faster you get this done,
the sooner you'll get back.

50:14.458 --> 50:16.125
I appreciate it, buddy.

50:22.583 --> 50:24.583
There's no shame
in fainting, Rosalie.

50:24.667 --> 50:27.458
But in a perfect world,
not at the scene of a crime.

50:28.291 --> 50:29.208
(body thuds)

50:29.291 --> 50:31.583
(traffic light clicking)

50:38.291 --> 50:41.625
As I was saying, a lot of
people faint their first time.

50:44.417 --> 50:45.792
(sighs)

51:02.792 --> 51:04.792
-Hey.
-Hey.

51:06.959 --> 51:08.291
So?

51:09.834 --> 51:11.500
Did you
find Frank?

51:12.500 --> 51:14.041
No need.
The situation changed,

51:14.125 --> 51:16.125
but thanks
for the info.

51:16.750 --> 51:18.458
Because
he's dead.

51:19.750 --> 51:20.875
Huh.

51:20.959 --> 51:23.125
Good thing I didn't go
looking for him then.

51:26.625 --> 51:30.458
Salas is bringing in a boat
full of heroin next week.

51:30.542 --> 51:33.333
-Charlie knows about it.
-How does he know?

51:34.000 --> 51:36.750
Salas sent a hitman
to take care of him,

51:36.834 --> 51:38.583
but must have shopped
around for a bargain,

51:38.667 --> 51:41.875
and Charlie caught
the guy. Tortured him.

51:41.959 --> 51:42.917
Killed him?

51:43.000 --> 51:45.667
Didn't ask,
and I wasn't there.

51:48.208 --> 51:50.250
What's Charlie
gonna do?

51:50.333 --> 51:51.959
What do you think
Charlie's gonna do?

51:53.333 --> 51:55.500
Hijack the shipment.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.208
Except I doubt there'll
be any shipment.

51:59.917 --> 52:02.834
Junior and Salas have been
spending time together lately.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.291
Why don't you bust
Junior already?

52:09.959 --> 52:11.792
Because you get paid to wait?

52:11.875 --> 52:14.333
Nothing sticks yet,
is that it?

52:16.709 --> 52:17.583
Right.

52:18.041 --> 52:20.208
So, when Charlie tries
to hijack the shipment

52:20.291 --> 52:22.000
and no one
shows up,

52:22.083 --> 52:24.333
he'll figure
someone talked.

52:25.375 --> 52:28.083
Dillon:
Look, I know you're not
big on taking my advice,

52:28.166 --> 52:30.875
but you better make sure
he doesn't think it's you.

back, I will.

Episode five starts a little bit
with a timeout.

56:27.083 --> 56:30.458
Charlie and Jett are having
their next date

56:30.750 --> 56:33.125
that he wondered if she would
actually want to have.

56:33.208 --> 56:34.333
SEBASTIAN GUTIERREZ:
We get a really good sense

56:34.625 --> 56:37.625
as to how much she and Charlie
like each other as people.

56:37.709 --> 56:40.625
If Jett gets nervous at all,
she's a little nervous here.

56:40.709 --> 56:42.959
And these coincidences
that are piling up,

56:43.375 --> 56:45.458
it's not gonna take very long
for Charlie

56:45.542 --> 56:47.625
to start putting together
that Jett might be involved.

You gonna tell me how you really
got hurt?

She makes up this story

56:50.792 --> 56:52.417
about waking up
and sleepwalking.

56:52.500 --> 56:53.709
If I did,
you'd never believe it.

56:53.792 --> 56:55.375
You know, she knows
that he knows her pretty well.

56:55.458 --> 56:58.000
I think if anyone could see
a tell, it would be him.

56:58.083 --> 56:58.917
Try me.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.709
We realize that part of this
is true.

57:00.792 --> 57:03.000
Like, she is actually revealing
things about herself

57:03.083 --> 57:04.291
that she normally wouldn't,

57:04.375 --> 57:07.083
and so this is mixing
truth and fiction.

57:07.166 --> 57:09.083
Different characters here are
technically betraying

57:09.166 --> 57:11.375
the other characters, so Jett
is collecting information

57:11.458 --> 57:12.417
that will hurt Charlie.

57:12.500 --> 57:14.083
JETT: What are you gonna do

where life really is cheap.

57:19.041 --> 57:21.458
And the only person
he can say that to is Jett.

57:21.542 --> 57:23.125
And of course,
Jett is one person

57:23.208 --> 57:26.750
who's actually working
with the cops to bring him down.

57:26.834 --> 57:28.542
Ah, it's a mess of a setup.

57:28.875 --> 57:30.291
There's only one exit route.

57:31.875 --> 57:32.750
What would you do?

57:32.959 --> 57:34.625
And also, she does have
a soft spot for him,

57:34.709 --> 57:35.709
there's no doubt about it.

57:36.000 --> 57:36.792
