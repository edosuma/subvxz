00:46.922 --> 00:49.800
[mutters, gasps]

00:49.883 --> 00:50.884
The ring!

00:52.803 --> 00:54.221
[gasps loudly]

00:55.430 --> 00:57.015
-Oh, no!

[tires screech]

01:24.751 --> 01:26.837
You can't escape me now.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.505
After I'm through with you,

01:28.588 --> 01:31.675
I'll kill the Trollhunter,
and everyone else!

01:31.758 --> 01:34.469
- Are you mad?
- No! I'm free!

01:34.553 --> 01:36.555
[shouts]

01:40.350 --> 01:41.560
[car crashes]

01:44.938 --> 01:47.774
[Jim] Then I took the Killstone from him,
and never looked back.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.818
A valiant risk for the second
Triumbric Stone.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.404
But you say Angor Rot's ring
was destroyed?

01:52.487 --> 01:54.906
Yeah, he wasn't very happy
to lose his soul.

01:54.990 --> 01:58.118
Now that no one controls him,
I guess he'll be on a warpath.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.121
All the more reason to find the third
and last stone before he shows up again.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.624
Hey! Good to see you
back to normal, Blinky.

02:03.707 --> 02:06.043
-I was starting to miss you there.
-Ah.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.755
My only regret was that I never had
a chance to drive one of your automobiles.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.089
Say, what was that legend again?

02:11.173 --> 02:13.884
"Three forces elemental thou must seek
in marshlands,

02:13.967 --> 02:15.552
caverns deep, and mountain's peak."

02:17.220 --> 02:20.057
If I can memorize 400 lines
of Shakespeare, I can remember that.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.226
Check and check on the marshlands
and mountain.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.062
That just leaves us the caverns deep.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.690
Trouble is, Tobias,
all trolls live in caverns deep.

02:28.774 --> 02:32.277
To search them all would far outlast
our life-spans.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.987
Has anyone seen Aaarrrgghh!!!?

02:34.071 --> 02:36.823
If we plan on finding the final stone,
we'll need all hands on deck.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.578
-Can you wiggle your fingers?
-Uh-uh.

02:41.662 --> 02:45.832
The poison has spread.
It will only grow worse.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.502
I'm afraid the effects are irreversible.

02:49.628 --> 02:55.384
- You... still haven't told your friends?
- Must help fight Gunmar.

02:55.467 --> 02:59.596
Then, I suppose you'll tell them
you punched a wall.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.848
You stubborn brute.

03:01.932 --> 03:06.019
But one of these days,
they'll find you turned to solid stone.

03:06.103 --> 03:09.940
- You have to tell them.
- Not today.

03:10.023 --> 03:14.277
Very well, my friend. Not today.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.654
[indistinct chatter]

03:15.737 --> 03:18.323
So the last stone gave you
those sweet thigh blades.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.242
- What do you think this one'll do?
- I don't know.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.993
We'll have to cut it and then we'll--

03:22.077 --> 03:23.412
-[horn blares]
-[all gasp]

03:23.495 --> 03:25.580
-What... was that?
-[power shuts off]

03:25.664 --> 03:27.082
[all muttering]

03:27.165 --> 03:28.583
[chittering]

03:28.667 --> 03:31.002
Not sure. But stay close.

03:31.086 --> 03:35.006
Put that sword away. Don't you know
our guests are sensitive to light?

03:35.090 --> 03:36.883
[Jim] Guests?

03:36.967 --> 03:39.761
[horn blows, drums beat]

03:53.859 --> 03:57.028
Wow. They all look like Aaarrrgghh!!!

03:57.112 --> 03:59.698
Queen Usurna of the Krubera.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.033
They reside in the deepest caverns
under the Earth's mantle.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.327
Rarely do they venture this close
to the surface.

04:04.411 --> 04:08.790
- Deepest caverns? You don't think that--
- It's plausible, if not convenient.

04:09.875 --> 04:13.420
- Your visit is an unexpected honor.
- Vendel.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.047
They're as talkative as Aaarrrgghh!!! too.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.632
- I thought Aaarrrgghh!!! was a Gumm-Gumm.
- Aaarrrgghh!!! was, but...

04:18.716 --> 04:21.011
he was born a Krubera. Now hush!

04:21.094 --> 04:23.346
-Aarghaumont, my kinstroll.
-Mm.

04:28.393 --> 04:32.606
The centuries pass,
yet you remain forever in our hearts.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.274
My queen.

04:36.151 --> 04:40.113
Allow me to introduce our Trollhunter.
Slayer of Gunmar's son.

04:40.197 --> 04:44.075
Uh, James Lake Junior,
Your Queen-ness.

04:44.159 --> 04:49.122
The human Trollhunter.
I heard stories, but didn't believe.

04:49.206 --> 04:53.877
- Ask her about the stone.
- Your Highness... lady?

04:53.960 --> 04:57.547
I recently heard a story
about the deep caverns,

04:57.631 --> 05:00.008
and a magical stone.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.259
A stone?

05:01.343 --> 05:06.306
From a trilogy of sorts?
Some might say of the Triumbric variety?

05:06.389 --> 05:08.850
- That's not how you speak to a queen.
-[chuckles]

05:08.934 --> 05:11.311
Their informality is amusing.

05:11.394 --> 05:14.773
No, Trollhunter. We do not have it.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.150
But I am familiar with that
which you seek.

05:17.234 --> 05:21.196
It was once in our possession,
but stolen years ago.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.865
But if you don't have it,
why did you come here--

05:23.949 --> 05:28.286
To celebrate...
this rare and momentous visit,

05:28.370 --> 05:31.915
I propose a grand match of PyroBligst!

05:31.998 --> 05:32.958
[all cheer]

05:33.041 --> 05:37.003
Then it is wise that I brought with me
our tribe's two heartiest trolls.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.213
[giggles]

05:38.296 --> 05:40.882
Aaarrrgghh!!! will represent us.

05:40.966 --> 05:44.010
To be paired with our Trollhunter.

05:44.094 --> 05:47.556
Yeah! Go, Jimbo!

05:47.639 --> 05:50.517
Wait, PyroBligst? What is that? A game?

05:50.600 --> 05:54.396
Oh, it is a tradition as old
as it is dismembering.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.774
I shall look forward to the game,
later this evening.

05:57.857 --> 06:02.487
Long ago, in the Old Wars,
Gunmar raided the Krubera caverns.

06:02.571 --> 06:05.699
Gumm-Gumms kidnapped their young
to enlist them for their army.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.952
If the Krubera are so sensitive
to light, how come Aaarrrgghh!!! isn't?

06:09.035 --> 06:12.831
Aaarrrgghh!!! was forced to adapt
in many ways, hardened to survive.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.375
Is that why he doesn't speak
as elegantly as they do?

06:15.458 --> 06:18.169
Being ripped away from your home
at such a tender age,

06:18.253 --> 06:19.754
has a way of stunting one's potential.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.715
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.345
-Whoa!
-Toby, get back.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.639
This is a delicate and sacred ritual.

06:29.723 --> 06:33.226
- And you're drooling all over it.
- [Claire] Look at that faceting.

06:33.310 --> 06:36.062
Two stones down, and one more to go...

06:36.146 --> 06:39.566
until we can give Gunmar
the payback he deserves.

06:42.569 --> 06:46.531
Time and distance have separated
our tribes for too long.

06:46.615 --> 06:51.161
May the match bring forth a new era
of friendship and cooperation.

06:51.244 --> 06:55.874
Save your hogwash, Usurna.
I know why you are here.

06:55.957 --> 07:00.170
The Krubera trolls can sense
when the light dims in one of our tribe.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.005
Aarghaumont is dying.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.007
If he returns to our caves,

07:04.090 --> 07:07.177
the salt mines will allow him
to live out his centuries.

07:07.260 --> 07:11.473
[Vendel] Trollmarket is his home.
[Usurna] It will be his deathbed!

07:11.556 --> 07:13.391
[Vendel] His friends are here.

07:13.475 --> 07:17.729
As the Queen of the Krubera, I have
the right to return him to our fold.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.230
There will be no debate.

07:19.314 --> 07:22.817
Then, might I propose a friendly wager?

07:22.901 --> 07:23.902
[Usurna laughs]

07:23.985 --> 07:27.489
Trollmarket has never won
a game of PyroBligst. Ever.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.867
We've never had a human Trollhunter
on our team either.

07:30.951 --> 07:34.245
I have come to expect the impossible
from the boy.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.664
If you win...

07:35.747 --> 07:39.793
Aarghaumont comes with us.
And if Trollmarket wins?

07:39.876 --> 07:42.212
Then Aaarrrgghh!!! will choose...

07:42.295 --> 07:43.755
for himself.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.427
-[groans]
-[brakes screech]

07:49.511 --> 07:51.513
[Strickler] Oh, thank heavens.
You made it!

07:51.596 --> 07:55.392
Let me in. We don't have time.
Angor won't stop until he finds us.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.896
You are mistaken, <i>mein freund.</i>
He won't stop until he finds you.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.107
I demand you open the door!

08:02.190 --> 08:06.903
You no longer make demands.
The Janus Order has discussed matters.

08:06.987 --> 08:11.491
While we seek the return of Gunmar,
you seek only your own glory.

08:11.574 --> 08:14.411
I seek glory for all changelings!

08:14.494 --> 08:16.287
[blows raspberry, laughs]

08:16.371 --> 08:19.040
Angor Rot will kill me! You know that!

08:19.124 --> 08:22.043
-Then I will send flowers.
-[laughs]

08:22.127 --> 08:24.170
[tires screech]

08:26.798 --> 08:30.468
So, how do we play this game?
I really should have asked earlier.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.511
[chuckles nervously]

08:31.594 --> 08:32.929
[all cheer]

08:37.767 --> 08:40.437
- Oh, boy.
- The object is simple.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.188
You and Aaarrrgghh!!! need to get the Gorb

08:42.272 --> 08:44.524
past the other team
and into the Soothscryer.

08:44.607 --> 08:48.069
- Yeah, but... where's Aaarrrgghh!!!?
- I thought he was with Tobias.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.571
Blinkous, where is Aaarrrgghh!!!?

08:49.654 --> 08:53.033
He isn't here? I hardly noticed.

08:53.116 --> 08:56.786
It is imperative he play.
You! The big-headed one.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.872
He likes you. Go find him.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.749
Huh!

09:00.832 --> 09:03.084
Draal, you're in.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.171
It would be my honor to compete
in the Forge once again.

09:06.254 --> 09:10.175
- Not compete. Win.
- It is only a game, Vendel.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.384
This isn't a game!

09:11.468 --> 09:14.095
Okay, Vendel,
can I have my amulet back now?

09:14.179 --> 09:17.223
- You didn't tell the boy?
- In PyroBligst,

09:17.307 --> 09:22.020
combatants must earn their weapons,
including your amulet.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.064
- Great.
- You take the small one.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.441
I'll handle the big guy.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.116
- Which one is the small one?
- Hard to tell, huh?

09:35.200 --> 09:39.120
They are bred for combat. Trained to kill.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.413
Thank you for that.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.960
[growls]

09:46.044 --> 09:46.878
[grunts]

09:48.213 --> 09:49.214
Grab it! Grab it!

09:49.297 --> 09:50.882

09:54.594 --> 09:55.512

[chitters]

10:06.689 --> 10:08.024
[grunts]

10:08.108 --> 10:10.902
I'm... gonna need that amulet.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.154
How was that hit legal?
He nearly killed him.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.491
Unfortunately, killing is fair play
in PyroBligst.

10:16.574 --> 10:20.995
Your human Trollhunter
plays as well as I expected.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.958
Nana? Are you home?

10:26.876 --> 10:28.837
[video game music plays]

10:30.296 --> 10:33.133
I know you're under there.
I can hear you playing Go-Go Sushi.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.136
[Aaarrrgghh!!! grunts]

10:36.219 --> 10:37.220
[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Oh.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.765
What are you doing?
We always play that together.

10:40.849 --> 10:44.144
- What happened to your hand?
- Hit wall. No biggie.

10:44.227 --> 10:47.730
What's going on? You've been acting
real weird since the Quagawumps.

10:47.814 --> 10:52.485
Jim needs you for the pyro...
technical-whatever-ma-jigger.

10:52.569 --> 10:53.778
[Nana] Toby-pie!

10:53.862 --> 10:55.530
-[Toby gasps]
- Is that you I hear?

10:55.613 --> 10:57.448
She's home. Quick. Hide!

10:57.532 --> 10:58.992
[doorknob rattles]

10:59.075 --> 11:00.827
Put this over your shoulders. Oh, no.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.288
-Toby!
-[laughs nervously]

11:03.371 --> 11:06.374
What are you doing home, Nana?
I thought you were out playing Bingo?

11:06.457 --> 11:08.293
I was taking a catnap.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.336
Oh, you have a guest?

11:10.420 --> 11:11.796
[grunts loudly]

11:11.880 --> 11:14.257
And you didn't introduce me?

11:14.340 --> 11:17.302
- Oh.
- He's a friend. I can explain! He's...

11:17.385 --> 11:20.763
He's so... tall... and hairy.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.808
Yes, he is freakishly tall.

11:23.892 --> 11:27.186
This is Aaarrrgh-thur-Sashimisushi!

11:27.270 --> 11:31.357
He's an exchange student who will
be staying with us for a little while.

11:31.441 --> 11:35.695
He's from... Japan.
He's an amateur sumo wrestler!

11:35.778 --> 11:38.281
How exciting. <i>Konichiwa.</i>

11:38.364 --> 11:41.242
Go-nicky-wa.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.749
[shouts]

11:48.958 --> 11:49.792
[pants]

11:58.009 --> 11:59.469
Why don't we ever get the Gorb?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.054
- In--
- Wait, let me guess.

12:01.137 --> 12:05.099
- Have to earn that, too.
- Now you are learning PyroBligst.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.227
-I'll buy you time.
-[clanks]

12:11.022 --> 12:13.149
[roars]

12:18.029 --> 12:19.405
Go, Trollhunter!

12:23.660 --> 12:26.454
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

12:37.340 --> 12:38.967
[all chittering]

12:40.093 --> 12:43.513
It's the human body. Quite nimble.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.141
Another slice, Arthur-San?

12:47.225 --> 12:50.019
I insist. Who can say no to pie?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.105
Hey, man. I get why you're hiding.

12:52.188 --> 12:56.359
Dealing with family can be stressful.
I mean, take me and Nana.

12:56.442 --> 13:00.488
Sure, she's half-blind,
and smells like mothballs,

13:00.571 --> 13:04.534
but she took me in after what happened
to my parents. She loves me.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.370
Every time I get frustrated with her,
I just think about that.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.872
Oh, sorry, Toby-pie.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.626
Mr. Meow Meow PI used
your gentleman's cap as a potty.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.170
[grunts angrily]
My magic hat!

13:17.672 --> 13:18.548
Mmm.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.759
That's okay, Nana. I'll just get another.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.261
[laughs]

13:23.344 --> 13:25.346
Your family came all this way to see you.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.598
The least you could do
is spend some time with them.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.267
[sniffs, gags]

13:29.350 --> 13:31.519
Oh, that's gnarly! Are you hungry?

13:31.602 --> 13:34.605
[slurps] Mm!

13:34.689 --> 13:35.523
[clanks]

13:40.987 --> 13:42.030
[all cheer]

13:42.113 --> 13:44.032
[roars]

13:44.657 --> 13:48.661
- Is it over? Please say it's over.
- 'Tis the Scalding Hour.

13:48.745 --> 13:49.912
The we-do-what hour?

13:49.996 --> 13:53.041
We seal our wounds
with burning hot metal

13:53.124 --> 13:56.127
- in preparation for the second half.
- Eh, I'll pass.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.171
Well done, Master Jim. And by "well done,"

13:58.254 --> 14:02.258
I mean at least you haven't
completely embarrassed yourself, or died.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.677
- Thanks, Blink.
- Aaarrrgghh!!! still isn't here?

14:04.761 --> 14:07.889
I've tried Toby. No answer.
Aaarrrgghh!!! might not make it back.

14:07.972 --> 14:12.101
- We must win.
- I know, for the glory of Trollmarket.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.563
Fools play for glory.
We are playing for Aaarrrgghh!!!

14:15.646 --> 14:17.065
- What?
- If they win,

14:17.148 --> 14:19.025
they are taking Aaarrrgghh!!!
away forever.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.652
They can do that? Why?

14:21.736 --> 14:25.365
What! Why! Where!
It doesn't matter. Just win the match.

14:25.448 --> 14:30.328
- We're not gonna win.
- We may be down, but we're not out!

14:30.411 --> 14:36.250
- This is the Forge where heroes are born.
- We're down four to one.

14:36.334 --> 14:40.421
And we're going to be down one more
if we give up on Aaarrrgghh!!!

14:40.505 --> 14:42.882
My father watches us from above.

14:42.965 --> 14:46.719
Let us make the Trollhunters
of the past proud.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.430
Let us make Trollmarket proud.

14:49.514 --> 14:52.642
Let us show our guests
the humbling they deserve!

14:52.725 --> 14:57.939
Fools play for glory.
But we play for Aaarrrgghh!!!

14:58.022 --> 14:59.357
For Aaarrrgghh!!!

15:12.745 --> 15:14.330
- For Aaarrrgghh!!!?
- For Aaarrrgghh!!!

15:19.377 --> 15:20.503
Stay on the Gorb!

15:24.966 --> 15:26.300
[grunts]

15:27.051 --> 15:28.094
[shouts]

15:33.850 --> 15:36.060
[pants] Aaarrrgghh!!!

15:44.527 --> 15:45.945
[chuckles]

15:46.028 --> 15:48.781
- Cool.
- A warrior's shield!

15:48.865 --> 15:52.618
You've earned it. Now, test it!

15:52.702 --> 15:54.245
[both] Aaarrrgghh!!!

15:54.328 --> 15:56.080
Since when does Jim have a shield?

15:56.164 --> 15:58.166
He's unlocked the power
of his second stone!

15:59.041 --> 16:00.918
[chittering]

16:06.549 --> 16:08.384
Aaarrrgghh!!!

16:09.719 --> 16:11.304
Aaarrrgghh!!!

16:14.849 --> 16:16.851
[all chant] Aaarrrgghh!!!
Aaarrrgghh!!!

16:16.934 --> 16:18.269
Aaarrrgghh!!! Aaarrrgghh!!!

16:18.352 --> 16:20.938
- We've tied it up!
- Next score wins.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.273
Time to finish it!

16:22.356 --> 16:24.317
[clanking]

16:27.320 --> 16:28.321
Aaarrrgghh!!!

16:32.992 --> 16:34.327
Jim! Here!

16:35.328 --> 16:37.163
Aaarrrgghh!!!

16:38.539 --> 16:40.041
[ringing]

16:40.124 --> 16:41.667
[all cheer]

16:43.586 --> 16:45.630
-Draal, are you okay?
-[groans]

16:47.340 --> 16:50.384
Am I... in the Void? Father? Father!

16:50.468 --> 16:52.595
It'll take time for that hit to wear off.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.430
Problem is, he doesn't have time.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.765
[grunts]

16:55.848 --> 16:59.018
We'll never find a suitable replacement.
You'll have to take them both on.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.270
By myself? For Pete's sake.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.980
Not for Pete. For Aaarrrgghh!!!

17:29.090 --> 17:31.217
Aaarrrgghh!!! Oh, it's good to see you.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.927
[all chant] Aaarrrgghh!!!

17:33.553 --> 17:35.221
Yeah!

17:35.304 --> 17:37.890
What fortunate timing, Tobias.
The Bligst is nearly over.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.934
I have no idea what's happening.
Is that a good thing?

17:40.017 --> 17:42.603
If they score, yes.
If the other team scores, no.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.984
[grunts, shouts]

17:50.778 --> 17:51.904
[gasps]

17:53.656 --> 17:55.032
It's all you, Aaarrrgghh!!!

17:55.116 --> 17:56.492
[shouts]

18:06.836 --> 18:07.795
[roars]

18:11.549 --> 18:13.217
[excited chittering]

18:16.178 --> 18:17.597
[roar]

18:17.680 --> 18:19.807
[Jim] Aaarrrgghh!!!

18:19.890 --> 18:22.310
- You did it!
- We did it.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.312
Aaarrrgghh!!!, your hand.

18:24.395 --> 18:27.106
- [Claire] What a rush!
-[Blinky] Well done, you two.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.066
Trollmarket is victorious!

18:29.150 --> 18:30.067
[crowd cheers]

18:30.151 --> 18:32.194
A Bligst for the ages.

18:32.278 --> 18:36.490
[Vendel] The time has arrived that
we bid our friends farewell.

18:36.574 --> 18:40.745
But first, one last order of business.

18:40.828 --> 18:41.829
[Usurna] Aarghaumont...

18:41.912 --> 18:46.584
Brother, we know you are not well,
but battled honorably.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.545
Will you return with us, your family?

18:49.629 --> 18:52.757
Or fight your last days here
amongst your friends?

18:52.840 --> 18:55.635
What does she mean, "his last days?"

18:55.718 --> 18:56.969
[Usurna] The choice is yours.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.098
Your wound. Creeper's Sun poison.

19:01.182 --> 19:03.559
-[groans]
-Oh, Aaarrrgghh!!!

19:03.643 --> 19:05.269
Why did you not tell us?

19:05.353 --> 19:08.314
- Didn't want worry.
- Angor Rot must've cut him.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.778
[sighs] This is my fault.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.238
It should've been me that got hurt.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.659
Not Jim's fault. Don't wanna leave.

19:20.201 --> 19:21.577
[gasps]

19:22.828 --> 19:26.248
The only way you will survive
is with your own kind.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.501
You must return with them.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.170
- We can always visit.
- I'm afraid, Master Jim,

19:31.253 --> 19:34.382
only the Krubera can thrive
in the Deep Caves.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.010
Oh. Well...

19:39.095 --> 19:42.014
- If it means he'll live...
- Aaarrrgghh!!!

19:42.098 --> 19:45.768
What sort of a friend would I be
if I demanded you stay?

19:48.521 --> 19:50.523
I... will go.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.191
[cries]

19:56.404 --> 19:57.863
Goodbye.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.283
[sighs]

20:01.367 --> 20:06.038
- The times, the laughs...
- For once, he's speechless.

20:06.122 --> 20:09.750
And here,
we just got to know each other.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.293
I'll miss you, big guy.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.256
Goodbye, old friend.

20:15.339 --> 20:18.467
I shall protect them in your stead.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.846
Wingman?

20:23.305 --> 20:24.598
-[sobs]
-Oh.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.646
[grumbles]

20:30.730 --> 20:35.985
- Get Gunmar... for me.
- Be well, big guy.

20:40.656 --> 20:45.828
Tell Wingman, he family. I, family.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.549
[game music plays]

21:01.010 --> 21:02.470

21:02.553 --> 21:04.847
[sobs]

21:04.930 --> 21:07.725
[Nana] Toby-pie! Dinner!

21:07.808 --> 21:09.351
I'm never eating again!

21:09.435 --> 21:12.563
[Nana] But you're being so rude
to our exchange student!

21:12.646 --> 21:14.440
-[Aaarrrgghh!!! chuckles]
-Arthur-San?

21:14.982 --> 21:16.734
-Aaarrrgghh!!!
-Ooh.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.152
...thur.

21:18.235 --> 21:21.363
- Oh. I'll get the pie.
- You came back!

21:21.447 --> 21:24.241
But what about your family? Your home?

21:24.325 --> 21:27.953
Am home. Krubera not family.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.955
You are.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.625
You'll turn to stone.
You'll get sick if you stay.

21:32.708 --> 21:37.338
Not today. Today help fight Gunmar.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.465
Play Go-Go Sushi.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.842
This my choice.

21:41.926 --> 21:44.762
You old stubborn brute,
how can I stay mad at you? Come on?

21:44.845 --> 21:47.681
But after we're done with Gunmar,
I'm taking you home to get better

21:47.765 --> 21:51.018
in the Krubera caves myself. Capiche?

21:51.101 --> 21:52.728
Boom. Boom.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.068
Should I get my hammer?
This feels like a hammer situation.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.236
[laughs]

22:00.319 --> 22:01.779
-[chuckles]
-[rustling]

22:02.780 --> 22:04.073
For the glory of Merlin, Daylight is--

22:04.156 --> 22:07.451
Please, Trollhunter, you're my only hope.

22:07.535 --> 22:10.037
If you want to save your mother's life,

22:10.120 --> 22:12.540
you have to protect me.
