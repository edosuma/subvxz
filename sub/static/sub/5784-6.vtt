WEBVTT

00:00.533 --> 00:03.302
(theme music)

00:45.111 --> 00:48.180
(indistinct men's voices)

00:56.356 --> 00:58.490
Evening, gentlemen. Evening.

00:58.492 --> 01:01.427
How are you tonight?
Into the whiskey already, I see.

01:01.429 --> 01:04.329
What did you call me?
I called you an oaf.

01:04.331 --> 01:08.000
Only a moron would
say something so idiotic.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.802
Evening, Councilman.

01:09.804 --> 01:12.638
My drink is being poured
before I even take my seat.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.607
This is what makes you the best
barkeep in Toronto Junction.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.043
Shut your mouth, you rat.
Or what?

01:18.045 --> 01:21.747
Shall I open
another bottle, sir?
You haven't already?

01:26.986 --> 01:30.622
(grunting)
Watch yourself, man!

01:30.624 --> 01:34.626
(groaning and clinking glass)

01:39.799 --> 01:42.634
(George): The entire Junction
is just one unseemly hotel

01:42.636 --> 01:44.636
after the next.
Make no wonder they need

01:44.638 --> 01:48.474
extra constables on this beat.
It's just some drunks, George.

01:48.476 --> 01:51.677
Better than prohibition.
I don't know.

01:51.679 --> 01:55.147
I think the local option would
clean this place up nicely.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.449
George, prohibition is no fun.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.585
What would people do after work?

01:59.587 --> 02:02.221
Jackson, Toronto is one of the
greatest cities in the world.

02:02.223 --> 02:05.290
Go visit a museum,
go for a swim in Lake Ontario...

02:05.292 --> 02:07.426
Anything you could dream of
is at your fingertips.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.761
Well I dream
of having a drink.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.231
(smash)

02:12.233 --> 02:15.901
Hey! See what I mean?

02:20.473 --> 02:22.808
Toronto Constabulary!

02:26.446 --> 02:30.349
Hey, hey, break it up!

02:30.351 --> 02:32.718
Back off. Stay down.

02:32.720 --> 02:37.756
That's enough! You're all
spending a night in the cells.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.895
Thomas, we're to have
a house guest this week.

02:42.897 --> 02:45.230
She'll be staying in Bobby's
room while he's away.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.866
It's not your
sister again, is it?

02:47.868 --> 02:50.736
No. I told you, she's too ill
to travel this year.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.572
Oh, right. That's terrible.
In fact,

02:53.574 --> 02:55.741
we are to receive a woman
of some celebrity.

02:55.743 --> 02:58.911
Oh?
A celebrity
of the temperance movement.

02:58.913 --> 03:01.947
Oh.
The Reverend
Shore is bringing her

03:01.949 --> 03:05.584
all the way to Ontario to give
a speech in favour of
the local option.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.854
Over 100 towns in this province
are already dry

03:08.856 --> 03:13.892
and our campaign in the Junction
is nearing success. John.

03:16.229 --> 03:19.464
Why in God's green earth do
you care whether the
Junction goes dry?

03:19.466 --> 03:22.301
As the Junction goes,
so goes Toronto.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.736
Hide this.
Oh, that's going too far.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.738
And do not tell
your father where it is

03:26.740 --> 03:30.776
until our houseguest is gone.
Yes, mother.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.278
I tell you what. If the city
of Toronto ever does go dry,

03:33.280 --> 03:35.847
we're moving straight back
to England.

03:37.984 --> 03:41.587
(streetcar bell)

03:41.589 --> 03:43.622
(George): Oh, sir,
it's a terrible place.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.625
I hope I never have to work
another beat in the
Junction again.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.627
Not so long ago, Crabtree,
you were in prison.

03:48.629 --> 03:51.063
Consider yourself lucky to have
any beat at all.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.065
Point well taken, sir.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.667
Right then gentlemen,
rise and shine.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.803
Off ya go, lads.

04:00.940 --> 04:03.275
Oy, you there, let's go.

04:03.277 --> 04:06.578
Hey. Wake up.

04:08.314 --> 04:11.550
Sir, I think we have
a problem with this one.

04:11.552 --> 04:14.219
What is it?

04:14.221 --> 04:16.722
He's dead.

04:23.529 --> 04:26.898
His name is Arthur
Slauson. He's a lawyer and
a councilman in the Junction.u.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.301
He was involved in the bar brawl
there last night.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.403
Why were our Constables
patrolling up there?

04:31.405 --> 04:34.306
Too many drunks and not enough
coppers. We were asked to send

04:34.308 --> 04:36.808
a few men to help out.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.610
We can assume he was injured
in the brawl

04:38.612 --> 04:41.380
and succumbed sometime later.
The body has bruising

04:41.382 --> 04:44.349
and a few small gashes, but
nothing obviously fatal.

04:44.351 --> 04:48.186
I'll need to check for cerebral
edema and other internal
injuries.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.789
He was healthy enough to be
throwing punches last night.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.126
His cell mates say he never
woke up, never even
made a sound.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.628
Any idea how long
he's been dead?

04:56.630 --> 04:59.464
I'd estimate no more
than two hours.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.100
So it could be natural causes?
I really can't say.

05:02.102 --> 05:05.304
I'll have him delivered to the
morgue and get you an answer
straightaway.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.105
Thank you, Doctor.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.675
You're quite welcome,
Detective.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.110
Right,

05:12.112 --> 05:14.212
where are the men
that he fought with?

05:14.214 --> 05:16.982
Did you know Mr. Slauson?
Who?

05:16.984 --> 05:19.318
Councilman Arthur Slauson.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.620
The man you were fighting
with last night.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.722
I was fighting with
a lot of men last night.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.557
Was he that fancy fellow?

05:25.559 --> 05:29.428
I'll take that to mean that
you did not know him.

05:29.430 --> 05:33.432
I knew Slauson. We were
friendly. He was my neighbour.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.834
And yet you were fighting.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.836
I wouldn't say that.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.639
I got tangled with a few men,
but the one

05:40.641 --> 05:42.641
I was really fighting with
was Charlie Cutter.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.010
What caused the fight?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.579
I don't know what caused it.
We were just fighting.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.581
There must have been a reason.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.483
At some point,
Liam hit that fancy fellow

05:51.485 --> 05:55.153
and then all hell broke loose.
So Mr. Bertrand hit
Mr. Slauson.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.389
If I hit Slauson,
it was an accident.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.524
I was really trying to hit
Charlie Cutter.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.527
Did you see anyone else
strike Mr. Slauson?

06:02.529 --> 06:05.030
Sure, I hit him.
More than once.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.767
If you struck Mr. Slauson in
the head, Mr. Cutter,

06:08.769 --> 06:11.403
you may be responsible
for his death.

06:11.405 --> 06:14.139
The fight had nothing to do
with this man's death.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.941
Natural causes?

06:15.943 --> 06:18.910
Far from it. He was poisoned.
Poisoned?

06:18.912 --> 06:21.246
Doctor, Mr. Slauson wasn't given
anything to eat or drink

06:21.248 --> 06:23.915
from the time we arrested him
until we found him dead.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.251
He had acidosis of the blood
leading to a depression

06:26.253 --> 06:28.720
of the nervous system.
Though it can result from

06:28.722 --> 06:31.256
chronic illness,
it's most unlikely.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.058
How was he poisoned?

06:33.060 --> 06:35.060
I have yet to identify
the specific substance,

06:35.062 --> 06:37.262
but if he ingested nothing
since last night,

06:37.264 --> 06:40.132
then we're looking
for something slow-acting.

06:40.134 --> 06:42.868
Poison would suggest
premeditation.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.970
If he was a city councilman,

06:44.972 --> 06:46.972
the motive could be political.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.574
If you'll pardon my
interruption, Detective...

06:49.576 --> 06:51.543
I have seen
this man speak before.

06:51.545 --> 06:54.880
Gentlemen, this is Miss James.
She's been assisting me
in the morgue.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.349
A pleasure to make your
acquaintance, Miss James.

06:57.351 --> 06:59.785
Dr. Ogden speaks
very highly of you.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.320
When did you hear him speak,
Miss James?

07:02.322 --> 07:05.590
Some weeks ago. He was an
advocate for the Trade.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.859
The liquor trade.
That's right.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.128
Well, in that case, I would
have a bone to pick with him.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.164
If there ever was a place in
need of the local option,

07:12.166 --> 07:15.267
it's the Junction. The place
is teeming with drunks
at all hours...

07:15.269 --> 07:18.937
a filthy, awful place.
And one Miss James calls home.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.939
Of course no place is all bad.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.842
I'm sure there's plenty to
recommend in the Junction.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.077
Trains, for instance.
It's easy to leave.

07:26.079 --> 07:29.614
Not that you'd want to leave--
(throat clearing): Um...

07:29.616 --> 07:34.252
Miss James, why do you
suppose alcohol has become
such a problem in the Junction?

07:34.254 --> 07:36.621
It's the first stop on the
rail lines,

07:36.623 --> 07:38.423
so there's a hotel
on every corner.

07:38.425 --> 07:41.359
Those places offer
all manner of temptation.

07:41.361 --> 07:44.796
And are the people of the
Junction in favour of
the local option?

07:44.798 --> 07:47.032
Overwhelmingly, sir.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.667
As am I.

07:48.669 --> 07:52.871
A pro-liquor
councilman dead in the
midst of a temperance campaign.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.140
Sounds to me like the man's
politics got him killed.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.209
We should establish
a timeline of everything

07:57.211 --> 07:59.511
Mr. Slauson consumed
leading up to his death.

07:59.513 --> 08:02.547
Perhaps his wife can help us
account for his final hours.

08:02.549 --> 08:04.649
I'll call Chief Royce
in the Junction

08:04.651 --> 08:06.651
and tell him that
we'll handle the investigation.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.854
Right then, is this one mine?

08:08.856 --> 08:12.023
Oh, sir. I thought you'd be
taking the carriage.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.259
I can handle a little bike
ride, Murdoch.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.661
Do try to keep up.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.144
Sir...

08:33.146 --> 08:36.181
I believe the Slauson place
is right over here.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.517
(out of breath): See?

08:38.519 --> 08:40.552
Piece of cake, Murdoch.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.754
I was just as quick as you.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.856
Well, sir, I wasn't...

08:44.858 --> 08:48.026
Oh, yes. Quite swift.
Quite swift, sir.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.965
All this local option business
is ridiculous, if you ask me.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.568
Sir, if it's what the people
of the Junction want,

08:56.570 --> 08:58.370
I see no reason to prevent it.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.405
Liquor is a good thing for
a good man. A few drunks

09:00.407 --> 09:02.474
having too much is hardly
cause to get rid of it.

09:02.476 --> 09:06.044
I've never understood the
appeal of alcohol, sir.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.747
It impedes the brain's
ability to function,

09:08.749 --> 09:10.949
making it impossible
to think clearly.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.118
Well that's just it, Murdoch.
Don't you ever want to relax

09:13.120 --> 09:15.954
and stop thinking
for a couple of hours?

09:15.956 --> 09:18.957
No.

09:18.959 --> 09:22.160
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Slauson,
but we believe your husband
was murdered.

09:22.162 --> 09:26.965
Poisoned, in fact.
My God.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.601
How? Why?

09:29.603 --> 09:32.337
We were hoping you'd be able
to help us with that,

09:32.339 --> 09:35.407
Mrs. Slauson.
Where was your husband

09:35.409 --> 09:37.208
prior to 10 P.M. last evening?

09:37.210 --> 09:41.413
The last I saw him he was on
his way out after supper.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.548
It was about half past 8.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.483
What was prepared for supper?

09:45.485 --> 09:47.285
Beef and carrots.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.621
Did you make
the meal yourself?

09:49.623 --> 09:51.623
I did. And shared in it --
it was fine.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.725
Anything to drink?
Only water.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.727
I don't allow liquor
in the house.

09:55.729 --> 09:59.798
And where did Mr. Slauson go
at half past 8?

09:59.800 --> 10:02.434
The Peacock Hotel,
as he's done every night

10:02.436 --> 10:05.003
since I stopped allowing liquor
in the house.

10:05.005 --> 10:08.740
Witnesses state that your
husband didn't arrive there

10:08.742 --> 10:10.742
until nearly 10 P.M.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.044
Oh, that's right.

10:13.046 --> 10:16.381
I'm sorry,
this is all terribly...

10:16.383 --> 10:19.584
He had a meeting to attend
with the Reverend Shore.

10:19.586 --> 10:23.355
What was it about?
The Reverend and his fellow
temperancers want town council

10:23.357 --> 10:25.357
to call a plebiscite vote
on the local option.

10:25.359 --> 10:29.027
But to do so, they need every
councillor on board.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.830
Your husband was one who
opposed it.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.466
My husband was the only one
who opposed them.

10:34.468 --> 10:38.870
He was the last man standing
between the Junction and
prohibition.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.008
The scourge of liquor
is a terrible thing.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.543
It turns homes into hovels.

10:45.545 --> 10:48.079
We must stand up
to this scourge,

10:48.081 --> 10:51.282
for temperance is the will
of the Lord himself.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.351
(all): Amen! Amen!

10:53.353 --> 10:55.754
(man): Hallelujah!
It pleases me very much

10:55.756 --> 10:58.390
to introduce to you
a special guest.

10:58.392 --> 11:01.593
A woman of great standing who
has dedicated her life

11:01.595 --> 11:05.330
to our cause.
Mrs. Carrie A. Nation.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.599
(exclaiming)

11:07.601 --> 11:10.435
Sir?
Bloody Margaret.

11:10.437 --> 11:15.040
Liquor is not
merely a scourge.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.308
Liquor is a pestilential highway

11:17.310 --> 11:20.211
leading to ruin and
wretchedness.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.847
(applause)

11:22.849 --> 11:25.684
Liquor is ruining the lives
of our children,

11:25.686 --> 11:28.887
both born and unborn.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.956
It is the embodiment
of pure evil!

11:31.958 --> 11:34.693
(cheering and clapping)

11:36.595 --> 11:38.396
Bollocks.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.832
I think that's the woman
who's staying at my house.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.334
Well, she certainly knows how
to stir up a crowd.

11:43.336 --> 11:47.205
They scarcely need it. These
temperancers live and die
for their cause.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.675
Those who stand in our way
must be destroyed!

11:50.677 --> 11:53.378
(all): Hear, hear!

11:53.380 --> 11:56.948
The question is, is one of
them willing to kill for it?

12:05.491 --> 12:07.492
Poisoned? How awful.
Reverend,w awful.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.461
we understand you hosted
a meeting last night.

12:09.463 --> 12:13.631
Yes, at my home. We met with
Councilman Slauson at 9 P.M.

12:13.633 --> 12:16.134
for, oh, about half an hour.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.770
And you attempted to sway him
in favour of temperance?

12:18.772 --> 12:21.673
We wanted him to agree to put
it to a plebiscite vote.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.675
To put the decision
of temperance

12:23.677 --> 12:25.643
into the hands
of the Junction's citizens.

12:25.645 --> 12:29.481
So you leaned on him.
We merely wanted to
converse with him on the matter.

12:29.483 --> 12:32.517
A conversation that
ended in his death.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.286
Just what are you suggesting?

12:35.288 --> 12:38.022
Your guest speaker was
wielding an axe, Reverend.

12:38.024 --> 12:41.926
Your followers are,
shall we say, passionate.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.129
Nothing will stand in the way
of temperance and, yes,

12:44.131 --> 12:47.665
I may have let Mr. Slauson know
that, in no uncertain terms.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.301
But I did not kill him.
Maybe you know who did.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.872
I do not. But in all honesty,
it could have been anyone.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.840
The man was a belligerent drunk

12:55.842 --> 12:58.676
who offended, insulted,
and became violent

12:58.678 --> 13:02.647
with all he met. Even his wife
complained about him.

13:02.649 --> 13:05.150
One more thing, Reverend.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.952
Was anything served at the
meeting last night?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.754
Yes. Tea.

13:09.756 --> 13:13.491
I made it
and I poured it myself.

13:16.162 --> 13:20.398
The poison was methanol.
Better known as wood alcohol.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.567
Killed by alcohol.
A form of it, yes.

13:22.569 --> 13:25.003
Well, that's ironic.
A supporter of the liquor trade

13:25.005 --> 13:28.072
dying from alcohol consumption.
You could say he drank himself

13:28.074 --> 13:30.742
six feet under the table.
(chuckle)

13:30.744 --> 13:33.845
You'll get used to Dr. Ogden's
morbid sense of humour,

13:33.847 --> 13:36.114
Miss James.
In any event,

13:36.116 --> 13:40.351
wood alcohol is very different
from the type of alcohol used in
liquor. The two taste similar,

13:40.353 --> 13:44.122
but wood alcohol is quite
deadly. As little as an
ounce can kill a man.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.591
Could he have ingested it
accidentally?

13:46.593 --> 13:48.393
Without realizing?
It's possible.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.196
The initial effects are not much
different from regular alcohol.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.798
Mild drunkenness, headaches...

13:53.800 --> 13:57.068
I had Miss James read up on it.

13:57.070 --> 14:00.305
Wood alcohol is converted to
formic acid in the liver,

14:00.307 --> 14:03.241
causing metabolic acidosis.
The victim goes blind,

14:03.243 --> 14:06.578
sinks into unconsciousness and
dies. But none of those symptoms

14:06.580 --> 14:09.013
take their effect until hours
after ingestion.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.082
Which would explain
why he died

14:11.084 --> 14:13.084
so long after being
taken into custody.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.587
But here's the odd thing
about wood alcohol.

14:15.589 --> 14:18.857
It has a common antidote.
Oh?

14:18.859 --> 14:21.459
Liquor. Regular alcohol
inhibits the poison's effect

14:21.461 --> 14:23.261
on the body.
It's administered by doctors

14:23.263 --> 14:26.030
in case of accidental wood
alcohol consumption.

14:26.032 --> 14:30.134
So if Mr. Slauson had had even
one drink at the Peacock
Hotel...

14:30.136 --> 14:31.936
It would have saved his life.

14:31.938 --> 14:34.973
Of course he had a drink.
Why else would he come to a bar?

14:34.975 --> 14:37.508
You're absolutely certain?
Yes.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.178
You served him yourself then.
As I always do.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.046
I saw Mr. Slauson as he entered,

14:42.048 --> 14:44.282
so I reached for his bottle
straightaway.

14:44.284 --> 14:48.152
His bottle?
You buy a bottle of the good
stuff; keep it behind the bar.

14:48.154 --> 14:51.356
Stakeholders, we called
them back home.
That's right.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.691
This was his brand:
Dempsey's gin.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.527
Double, straight, no ice.

14:56.529 --> 14:59.330
He never drank anything else.
So,

14:59.332 --> 15:01.065
no one else ever
drank from his bottle.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.935
Certainly not.
You poured him the drink

15:03.937 --> 15:06.938
last night. But did you actually
see him drink it?
Yes.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.040
I recall distinctly;
he drank it down in one go.

15:09.042 --> 15:12.477
Was his reaction to the drink
at all unusual?

15:12.479 --> 15:16.781
In fact it was.
He pulled quite the face.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.783
I figured something
must be wrong,

15:18.785 --> 15:21.119
but before I could inquire,
the fight broke out.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.655
Mr. Buck,
something was indeed wrong.

15:23.657 --> 15:27.125
That drink contained the poison
that killed Mr. Slauson.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.761
No... that's impossible.

15:29.763 --> 15:32.030
I served him a drink from the
same bottle the night before

15:32.032 --> 15:34.999
and he had no complaints.
Did anyone have a chance

15:35.001 --> 15:37.302
to get behind your bar and
tamper with Slauson's bottle?

15:37.304 --> 15:40.638
No, not last night.
Before that?

15:40.640 --> 15:43.341
Earlier in the day,
the evening previous?

15:43.343 --> 15:47.011
I suppose someone could have
tampered with it during the day.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.846
I work the hotel desk.

15:48.848 --> 15:52.617
The bar is closed, but someone
could walk in if my back
were turned.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.452
And where is the bottle
in question?

15:54.454 --> 15:57.555
Well, the drink I poured him
was the last of the bottle.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.825
It's in with the other empties.

16:00.827 --> 16:03.127
Any idea which one
was Mr. Slauson's?

16:03.129 --> 16:06.331
They're all Mr. Slauson's.
No one else drinks his brand;

16:06.333 --> 16:08.533
I only order it for him. As for

16:08.535 --> 16:10.535
which bottle is from last night,
I'm not sure.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.537
We'll take all of them.

16:12.539 --> 16:16.407
(glass clinking)

16:16.409 --> 16:18.676
Did anyone touch these
since last night?

16:18.678 --> 16:21.412
No, certainly not.
The only person who's been in

16:21.414 --> 16:26.084
since your lot cleared the place
out was poor Mrs. Slauson,
looking for her husband.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.890
Miss James.
Good evening, Constable.

16:32.892 --> 16:35.426
You have the gin bottles
I am to test?

16:35.428 --> 16:38.363
I do indeed. I'm told
one of these bottles

16:38.365 --> 16:40.698
contains our murder weapon.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.900
I was never one for gin myself.
Nor I.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.902
Well, of course not. You're on
the side of temperance.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.938
I'm on the side
of the local option.

16:46.940 --> 16:49.974
What's the difference?
I only want temperance
for the Junction.

16:49.976 --> 16:52.443
If they want to drink somewhere
else, they can go right ahead.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.079
I simply don't want them
in my front yard.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.648
So you have nothing
against liquor.

16:57.650 --> 17:01.052
I have a glass of brandy every
night before bed.

17:01.054 --> 17:04.655
But now, if the Junction opts
for the local option...

17:04.657 --> 17:06.657
I can assure you, Constable,

17:06.659 --> 17:08.292
no law will keep me
from my brandy.

17:08.294 --> 17:12.096
Honestly, would a prohibition
really stop a man from drinking?

17:12.098 --> 17:14.799
If one bar closes,
he moves down the street.

17:14.801 --> 17:17.802
Yes, I suppose he does...

17:22.875 --> 17:25.810
I, for one, am looking forward
to the rally tomorrow,

17:25.812 --> 17:28.780
Mrs. Nation.
As am I, Mrs. Brackenreid.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.782
I wish there were more
good people like you

17:30.784 --> 17:32.784
south of the border.
If there were,

17:32.786 --> 17:36.220
Mr. McKinley could have been
saved. He drank in secret,
you know.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.289
Did you know that,
Mrs. Brackenreid?

17:38.291 --> 17:41.492
Uh, no, I don't believe I did.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.428
He was possessed by the devil.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.463
The Lord had no choice but to
put that bullet right through

17:45.465 --> 17:48.666
President McKinley's heart.
Ah, the Wednesday won again,

17:48.668 --> 17:50.902
one-nil against Stoke.
(chuckling)

17:50.904 --> 17:53.471
John!

17:53.473 --> 17:55.273
Excuse me, ladies.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.242
(Mrs. Nation): Now I'm not
saying I'm glad he did...

17:58.244 --> 18:00.912
Where's my scotch?

18:00.914 --> 18:03.614
I'm not supposed to tell.
Come on, son. You can't

18:03.616 --> 18:05.783
keep a man from his drink.
Mother made me promise.

18:05.785 --> 18:10.121
I'll tell you what. I promise
not to tell her that you told
me. It'll be our secret,

18:10.123 --> 18:13.825
one man to another.
I hid it in my room,

18:13.827 --> 18:16.394
behind the dresser.
Good lad.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.163
Our little secret.

18:19.165 --> 18:24.268
Mr. Slauson arrived at the
Peacock Hotel at 9:55

18:24.270 --> 18:26.437
and promptly consumed a drink

18:26.439 --> 18:28.306
from his usual bottle
of Dempsey's gin.

18:28.308 --> 18:31.542
But it wasn't gin,
it was poison.
It had to be.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.545
We also know that Mr. Slauson
was a heavy drinker,

18:34.547 --> 18:38.015
hardly in the habit of having
just one drink and calling
it a night.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.451
If he had stayed at the hotel,
he would surely have took

18:40.453 --> 18:43.287
another drink. Who wouldn't?
The first drink polished off

18:43.289 --> 18:45.356
the bottle -pure poison.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.625
Had he had time to have
a second drink,

18:47.627 --> 18:49.694
it likely would have come
from a brand new bottle --

18:49.696 --> 18:51.729
pure gin.
And the real stuff

18:51.731 --> 18:54.799
would have counteracted
the poison.
Indeed.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.502
For the poison to take effect,
he had to be prevented

18:57.504 --> 18:59.570
from taking that second drink.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.572
The bar fight.
You think it was staged

19:01.574 --> 19:03.441
to stop Slauson from taking
another drink?

19:03.443 --> 19:06.777
Well sir, he likely wouldn't
have died if the bar fight
hadn't happened.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.447
It played a crucial part
in his murder.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.716
Then the two drunks who
fought with Slauson

19:11.718 --> 19:13.985
could be our killers after all.

19:18.457 --> 19:20.725
Sir? No bicycles?

19:20.727 --> 19:24.395
I think it's time to get back
to a more civilized mode of
transport, Murdoch.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.397
Very sensible.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.366
When we get there,
we'll split up.

19:28.368 --> 19:31.769
I'll take Cutter's place,
you go after Bertrand.
Yes, sir.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.105
Sir! Sir.

19:34.107 --> 19:36.340
I have a business proposition.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.643
Make it quick, Crabtree.
Sir.

19:38.645 --> 19:42.547
If the Junction were to go dry,
where would people go
for a drink?

19:42.549 --> 19:44.749
I believe the idea is for them
not to drink, George.

19:44.751 --> 19:47.018
(laughing): Prohibit drinking?

19:47.020 --> 19:49.220
No law can get between
a man and his drink, Murdoch.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.222
Precisely, sir.
They would just go down the road

19:51.224 --> 19:54.525
to the next bar. So what if
someone were to open a bar

19:54.527 --> 19:56.727
just down the road
from the Junction?

19:56.729 --> 19:58.796
That someone would
make a killing.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.599
Every drunkard in that part of
town would start drinking there.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.601
Sir, I've found the perfect
plot of land for sale,

20:03.603 --> 20:05.937
just across the town line.

20:05.939 --> 20:07.939
I have to admit, that's
a clever enterprise.

20:07.941 --> 20:10.942
Thank you, sir. Your
investment would be
welcome also.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.944
Oh. Well, I--
Now hang on, I thought this

20:12.946 --> 20:15.780
was my deal.
I'll tell you what, Crabtree.

20:15.782 --> 20:18.649
You keep my name out of it and
I'll match your investment.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.851
Just make sure the wife
doesn't hear about it.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.955
Sir.

20:23.957 --> 20:26.090
(knocking)

20:26.092 --> 20:29.961
Good afternoon, Detective.
Mrs. Slauson.

20:29.963 --> 20:33.731
I'm afraid Mr. Bertrand left
early this morning and
hasn't returned.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.968
Oh, I see. Thank you.

20:36.970 --> 20:40.538
Fine day, isn't it?
Indeed it is.

20:43.809 --> 20:46.644
Cutter wasn't home, Murdoch.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.779
Apparently Mr. Bertrand
isn't either.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.082
Ah, well, not a problem.

20:51.084 --> 20:54.518
I know where to find a couple of
drunks on a sunny afternoon.

20:56.922 --> 21:01.325
In the name of the Lord,
we shall destroy these

21:01.327 --> 21:03.794
dens of immorality!

21:03.796 --> 21:05.596
(shouting)

21:05.598 --> 21:08.266
We shall deliver them

21:08.268 --> 21:11.769
to the same defilement
and devastation

21:11.771 --> 21:13.838
to which they have delivered

21:13.840 --> 21:17.141
so many souls!
(cheering)

21:18.877 --> 21:22.747
(all): LOCAL OPTION!
LOCAL OPTION!

21:22.749 --> 21:25.383
I knew the one man,
yes. Liam Bertrand.

21:25.385 --> 21:28.552
And what of the man he was
fighting with? Charles Cutter.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.755
I can't say
I'd ever seen him before.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.923
Have they been
in today for a drink?

21:32.925 --> 21:35.293
No, neither man's been in
since the brawl.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.295
LOCAL OPTION!

21:37.297 --> 21:39.363
LOCAL OPTION!

21:39.365 --> 21:42.233
LOCAL OPTION! LOCAL

21:42.235 --> 21:44.535
OPTION! LOCAL OPTION!

21:44.537 --> 21:46.637
LOCAL OPTION!

21:46.639 --> 21:50.174
LOCAL OPTION!
Clear the way!

21:50.176 --> 21:52.209
Vice! Sin!

21:52.211 --> 21:55.613
Despicable iniquity!
(man): What is this?

21:55.615 --> 21:58.182
(crashing)
What are you doing? Stop!

21:58.184 --> 22:00.951
No! Are you out of your mind?
That's enough!

22:00.953 --> 22:03.587
You've made--
you've made your point!

22:03.589 --> 22:07.091
How dare you!
Shut it.
Ladies!

22:07.093 --> 22:09.960
(Mrs. Nation): Let go of me!
Ladies, ladies.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.996
(Mrs. Nation): Well, I never!
(crash)

22:11.998 --> 22:15.533
Long live temperance!
Margaret! Dammit, woman!

22:15.535 --> 22:19.170
Get your hands off me!

22:19.172 --> 22:21.605
Sir! Look,

22:21.607 --> 22:24.275
it's them.
The drunks we're looking for?

22:24.277 --> 22:27.645
Cutter and Bertrand.
What are they doing
with this lot?

22:27.647 --> 22:30.981
Perhaps they aren't
drunks after all.

22:30.983 --> 22:33.050
Excuse me, gentlemen,

22:33.052 --> 22:35.619
but you're going to be
coming with us.

22:42.994 --> 22:44.995
Right then. Margaret. Ladies.

22:44.997 --> 22:48.299
Home time.

22:51.169 --> 22:53.371
Thank you, Thomas.
Ah, ah.

22:53.373 --> 22:57.441
Not you.
You let me out
of here this instant.

22:57.443 --> 22:59.443
You destroyed a man's
place of business.

22:59.445 --> 23:03.114
That is a crime, Mrs. Nation.
The purveyors of vice and sin

23:03.116 --> 23:04.849
are the ones guilty of crimes.

23:04.851 --> 23:07.952
(chuckling): Do you know
what's funny?
What?

23:07.954 --> 23:09.820
I'm the police inspector.

23:09.822 --> 23:12.790
I get to choose what crimes
we arrest people for.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.792
Come on, Margaret.

23:14.794 --> 23:17.061
Let's go and have a drink.

23:19.831 --> 23:21.999
You can't just leave her here.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.801
Are you defending her?

23:23.803 --> 23:26.837
Things may have gotten out of
hand, but we meant well.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.839
She took an axe
to a man's bar.

23:28.841 --> 23:31.041
She is our houseguest, Thomas.

23:31.043 --> 23:34.078
Oh, Lord, give me strength.

23:51.229 --> 23:53.330
It would appear that
you are a supporter

23:53.332 --> 23:55.433
of the temperance
movement. Mr. Cutter.

23:55.435 --> 23:58.903
Did I ever claim otherwise?

23:58.905 --> 24:01.539
You and Mr. Bertrand
were just in a bar.

24:01.541 --> 24:04.775
How do you explain that?
I wasn't drinking.

24:04.777 --> 24:09.680
Then why were you there?
To start a fight.

24:09.682 --> 24:12.550
You explicitly intended to
start the fight?

24:12.552 --> 24:15.653
It was part of a plan to
further our cause.

24:15.655 --> 24:18.789
And that plan involved the
death of Councilman Slauson.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.724
No, of course not.

24:20.726 --> 24:23.794
If the fight wasn't intended
to cause his death,

24:23.796 --> 24:26.597
then why start it?
Public opinion is everything

24:26.599 --> 24:28.599
in the campaign
for temperance, Detective.

24:28.601 --> 24:31.335
If fights break out in bars,
people blame liquor.

24:31.337 --> 24:34.305
Thus engendering support
for your cause.

24:34.307 --> 24:36.707
It is a victimless crime.
We're helping people.

24:36.709 --> 24:39.109
Was this the first time
you've staged a brawl?

24:39.111 --> 24:42.012
No. We've been asked to do it
a number of times.

24:42.014 --> 24:45.349
Asked by whom?
Reverend Shore.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.418
It was his idea.

24:50.755 --> 24:52.556
George,

24:52.558 --> 24:55.860
what do we know of Reverend
Shore's whereabouts that day?

24:55.862 --> 24:58.062
Well, prior to meeting
Mr. Slauson,

24:58.064 --> 25:00.064
the Reverend was on
a train from Cleveland,

25:00.066 --> 25:02.600
accompanying Mrs. Nation.
Oh.

25:02.602 --> 25:05.603
So he wouldn't
have had opportunity
to poison the gin bottle, then.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.771
No, sir, his train didn't
arrive until 7 o'clock.

25:07.773 --> 25:11.141
By then, the bar was open and
under Mr. Buck's watchful eye.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.577
Still, he could have

25:13.579 --> 25:15.579
organized the entire thing.

25:15.581 --> 25:18.382
If he employed Bertrand and
Cutter to start a fight,

25:18.384 --> 25:20.851
he could have paid them to
poison the bottle as well.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.053
It's possible.

25:23.055 --> 25:26.156
But if he did organize it,
we have no proof.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.363
It's up to you to do something
about him, Margaret.

25:32.365 --> 25:34.532
It's a wife's duty to keep
her husband from drink,

25:34.534 --> 25:37.067
lest his drunkenness
infect the family.

25:37.069 --> 25:40.004
Thomas is capable
of making his own choices.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.039
John! Supper!

25:42.041 --> 25:45.342
Make his own choices?
He's choosing damnation!

25:45.344 --> 25:48.512
Care to explain this,
Margaret?

25:48.514 --> 25:50.915
How did you find that?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Nation,

25:50.917 --> 25:53.317
I attempted to keep it from him.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.920
And you did quite the job of
it. It's been watered down.

25:55.922 --> 25:59.156
I did not touch
the contents of your bottle.

25:59.158 --> 26:02.560
No? Then maybe
it was Mrs. Nation.

26:02.562 --> 26:05.062
Dumped as much as you thought
you could get away with, eh?

26:05.064 --> 26:07.998
Or... did you fancy
a wee nip yourself?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.134
How dare you, sir!

26:10.136 --> 26:12.970
Those who preach the loudest
are always the biggest

26:12.972 --> 26:15.506
hypocrites, aren't they?

26:18.043 --> 26:21.245
Oops.
(giggling)

26:25.116 --> 26:28.786
(stifled laugh)
What are you laughing at?

26:28.788 --> 26:33.324
The boy is drunk! You've
corrupted your own offspring.

26:33.326 --> 26:35.960
I am terribly sorry,
Mrs. Nation.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.295
(whispering):
Take care of this, Thomas.

26:38.297 --> 26:42.600
We should take a hatchet
to the both of them.
That's rather harsh!

26:42.602 --> 26:45.069
(laughing)
Right.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.338
You, upstairs. Sleep it off.

26:47.340 --> 26:50.341
I'll deal with you
in the morning.

26:53.511 --> 26:56.246
You should have seen him,
Murdoch. The boy couldn't even

26:56.248 --> 26:59.450
stand up straight. There's
nothing quite like your
first time being drunk.

26:59.452 --> 27:02.853
As I recall it was one of the
worst moments in my life.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.856
You're not a Brackenreid.

27:05.858 --> 27:08.425
This is true. At any rate,

27:08.427 --> 27:11.195
I recommend that we canvass
the entire area

27:11.197 --> 27:13.297
around the Peacock
for any witnesses--

27:13.299 --> 27:15.566
(knocking)
Pardon me, gentlemen.

27:15.568 --> 27:17.568
I have the test results
from the gin bottles.

27:17.570 --> 27:20.137
Were you able to identify
which bottle was poisoned?

27:20.139 --> 27:22.306
In a sense.
Out of 11 bottles,

27:22.308 --> 27:24.742
10 had trace amounts of gin.
But the one exception

27:24.744 --> 27:27.378
had no trace of wood alcohol
in it -just water.

27:27.380 --> 27:31.448
Indicating it had been rinsed.
It would seem so.

27:31.450 --> 27:35.252
So, Mr. Slauson drank
the wood alcohol,

27:35.254 --> 27:37.287
the bottle was set aside.

27:37.289 --> 27:40.557
The fight broke out at that very
moment, and then the killer

27:40.559 --> 27:43.794
must have returned to rinse away
the evidence afterward.

27:43.796 --> 27:45.596
But our suspects
were arrested.

27:45.598 --> 27:47.598
They spent the evening
in the cells.

27:47.600 --> 27:51.502
Right. So Mr. Cutter and Mr.
Bertrand can't be our killers.

27:51.504 --> 27:54.505
What about the man who poured
the drink? Surely he had access

27:54.507 --> 27:57.508
to the bottle both to poison it
and to clean it afterward.

27:57.510 --> 28:00.411
But Mr. Buck is completely
without motive.

28:00.413 --> 28:02.746
In fact, by staving off
temperance,

28:02.748 --> 28:06.216
Mr. Slauson was the only person
keeping him in business.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.919
The wife.
Sir?

28:08.921 --> 28:11.388
The barman said that Mrs.
Slauson stopped by that night.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.457
She could have rinsed the bottle
when he wasn't looking.

28:13.459 --> 28:16.260
I saw her yesterday
leaving her home.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.395
She seemed in
awfully high spirits

28:18.397 --> 28:20.898
for someone whose husband
had just been killed.

28:20.900 --> 28:24.134
But still, it doesn't quite fit.

28:24.136 --> 28:27.337
Why not? She knew his routine,
she knew his bottle,

28:27.339 --> 28:29.707
and the Reverend said that they
were hardly locked in, uh...

28:29.709 --> 28:31.508
marital bliss.

28:31.510 --> 28:34.311
But sir, she didn't
orchestrate the fight.

28:34.313 --> 28:37.047
And how could she have known
that we'd arrest her husband

28:37.049 --> 28:39.016
just before he took
that second drink,

28:39.018 --> 28:40.851
before he drank the antidote?

28:40.853 --> 28:43.654
She may have had no idea that
liquor is an antidote

28:43.656 --> 28:46.590
to methanol.
It's hardly common knowledge.

28:46.592 --> 28:49.059
She may have just got lucky.

28:52.530 --> 28:54.832
Do you recognize this,
Mrs. Slauson?

28:54.834 --> 28:57.367
It's wood alcohol.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.369
It was found in your home.

28:59.371 --> 29:02.306
I use it to keep
my pipes from freezing.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.641
Who doesn't?
It's also

29:04.643 --> 29:07.578
the substance
that killed your husband.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.716
I see. And you think I did it.

29:12.718 --> 29:17.354
You are considerably younger
than Mr. Slauson was.

29:17.356 --> 29:20.691
How did you two come
to be married?

29:20.693 --> 29:23.994
We were in love.

29:25.530 --> 29:29.433
Reverend Shore said you often
complained about your husband.

29:29.435 --> 29:32.770
Are you married, Detective?
I am.

29:32.772 --> 29:36.273
Then rest assured your wife
has found occasion to
complain about you.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.842
Perhaps. But she's yet to find
cause to murder me.

29:38.844 --> 29:43.113
Arthur was a different man
when he was drinking.

29:43.115 --> 29:45.649
Always screaming insults, at me,

29:45.651 --> 29:47.951
my mother, anyone in his path.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.953
And he was a menace
in his motorcar.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.889
Killed a man's dog
in that thing.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.591
And one night, he crashed it
right into our front porch.

29:54.593 --> 29:56.627
And the next day,

29:56.629 --> 29:59.530
he always refused to admit
what he'd done.

30:01.266 --> 30:04.134
But I did love my husband,
Detective.

30:05.870 --> 30:08.205
I will mourn him.

30:08.207 --> 30:11.275
And I certainly
did not kill him.

30:13.912 --> 30:16.213
Mr. Slauson died
Tuesday evening.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.782
Where were you that afternoon?

30:18.784 --> 30:21.385
What does that matter?

30:21.387 --> 30:24.221
Am I to assume
you have no alibi?

30:24.223 --> 30:27.391
For Tuesday?
(sigh)

30:27.393 --> 30:30.227
I was considering joining the
temperance league.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.362
I spent all day
with Margaret Brackenreid.

30:32.364 --> 30:36.033
Margaret's confirmed it.
She even walked

30:36.035 --> 30:38.235
Mrs. Slauson to her door
at half past 6.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.637
So she didn't have time to
poison the gin bottle.

30:40.639 --> 30:43.140
That leaves us with only one
person who could have rinsed it.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.943
The barman. Leopold Buck.

30:45.945 --> 30:48.111
The one person
who had no motive.

30:48.113 --> 30:50.747
Sirs, pardon the interruption.

30:50.749 --> 30:54.051
Inspector, it seems our plan to
open a public house near
the Junction

30:54.053 --> 30:56.119
will have to be put on hold.
George,

30:56.121 --> 30:58.856
could we discuss this another
time? We are in the middle
of an investigation.

30:58.858 --> 31:01.825
Actually, sir, I think you'll
find this of interest as well.

31:01.827 --> 31:05.062
As you'll recall, I found the
perfect lot of land for our
venture. Well, I've just

31:05.064 --> 31:07.598
been informed that land has
already been sold.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.933
What, did someone else have
the same idea?

31:09.935 --> 31:13.136
It would appear so,
sir. And the man who bought
the property was Leopold Buck.

31:13.138 --> 31:15.372
The barman.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.941
Looking to profit from
prohibition.

31:17.943 --> 31:20.043
Looks like the man who poured

31:20.045 --> 31:22.312
the deadly drink
now has a motive.

31:27.452 --> 31:31.555
The facts are irrefutable, Mr.
Buck. You knew of Councilman
Slauson's drinking habits.lmn

31:31.557 --> 31:33.757
You had access to the gin bottle

31:33.759 --> 31:36.260
both before and after
the poisoning.

31:36.262 --> 31:39.229
You are the only person who
COULD have killed him.

31:39.231 --> 31:43.300
That's ridiculous. Why would
I kill one of my best customers?

31:43.302 --> 31:46.937
You were banking on the
Junction going dry

31:46.939 --> 31:50.407
so that you could open a new bar
just across the town line.

31:50.409 --> 31:54.077
The Reverend and I set up some
bar fights to gain favour
for temperance.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.613
What does that have to do
with Councilman Slauson?

31:56.615 --> 31:58.615
He stood in the way
of prohibition.

31:58.617 --> 32:02.753
We were working to convince
him, not to kill him.

32:02.755 --> 32:04.922
You had just purchased
the property.

32:04.924 --> 32:08.258
You needed Councilman Slauson
out of the way as soon
as possible.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.928
No... I didn't kill him.
I didn't--

32:10.930 --> 32:13.096
You can deny it all you want,
Mr. Buck.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.265
But you were the only person
who could have

32:15.267 --> 32:17.834
poisoned that gin bottle
and rinsed it out.

32:19.704 --> 32:21.972
I didn't kill him.

32:23.975 --> 32:26.810
Murder to clear the way
for a business venture...

32:26.812 --> 32:29.179
Men have killed for much less.
Leopold Buck

32:29.181 --> 32:32.382
is the only person who could
have possibly committed
the crime.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.885
Right. I'd best get on.

32:34.887 --> 32:37.220
Got to give John
a slap on the wrist.

32:37.222 --> 32:40.824
He stole my whiskey.
I'd imagine Margaret

32:40.826 --> 32:43.393
would be calling for more
than a slap on the wrist.

32:43.395 --> 32:46.596
She is. But you can't keep
a Brackenreid from his whiskey.

32:46.598 --> 32:48.565
(chuckling)
Inspector,

32:48.567 --> 32:51.435
forgive me if this is not
my place to say, but...

32:51.437 --> 32:54.571
I've met John. If he's drinking
whiskey, it could be

32:54.573 --> 32:56.773
that he's just trying to be
more like his father.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.575
What's wrong with that?

32:58.577 --> 33:00.911
I've been drinking for over
30 years with no ill effect.

33:00.913 --> 33:02.713
Drinking may work for you,

33:02.715 --> 33:06.516
but it doesn't
agree with everyone.
My father, for example.

33:06.518 --> 33:09.252
He looks up to you, Inspector.

33:09.254 --> 33:12.589
You can either condone his
behaviour or you can put
a stop to it.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.424
I'll speak to him. Mind you,

33:14.426 --> 33:16.360
if he's gonna keep on drinking,
he's got a lot to learn.

33:16.362 --> 33:19.429
When I was his age, I knew how
to nip my father's scotch.

33:19.431 --> 33:23.100
By the time John had finished
with it, the bottle was
virtually all water.

33:23.102 --> 33:26.036
Poured myself a drink and nearly
spat it across the room.

33:26.038 --> 33:28.138
Water?

33:28.140 --> 33:30.607
(suspenseful music)

33:41.652 --> 33:44.054
Sir.

33:44.056 --> 33:47.424
What if Mr. Slauson's drink was
neither gin nor poison?

33:47.426 --> 33:51.061
What are you thinking?
Mr. Slauson was disgusted

33:51.063 --> 33:53.196
by his drink. But it could
easily have been--

33:53.198 --> 33:54.998
Water.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.001
An unpleasant surprise when
you're expecting a stiff drink.

33:58.003 --> 34:00.837
The killer replaced
Mr. Slauson's gin

34:00.839 --> 34:03.540
with water to prevent him from
drinking the antidote.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.676
But the poison itself could have
been administered earlier.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.478
Bloody clever.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.747
That means the bartender is no
longer our prime suspect.

34:10.749 --> 34:12.549
If the bottle already
contained water,

34:12.551 --> 34:15.552
it didn't need to be rinsed
after the brawl.
Exactly.

34:15.554 --> 34:19.089
One of the two men who started
the bar brawl could be the
killer. Either of them

34:19.091 --> 34:21.858
could have substituted
the gin for water

34:21.860 --> 34:24.594
earlier that afternoon.
But the real question is,

34:24.596 --> 34:27.297
did either of them
have opportunity

34:27.299 --> 34:30.500
to poison Mr. Slauson before his
arrival at the hotel?

34:30.502 --> 34:32.702
They were both at the meeting
with Reverend Shore

34:32.704 --> 34:36.706
and at the Peacock thereafter.
They could have walked him
door to door.

34:46.651 --> 34:48.752
Mr. Cutter.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.754
Please tell me again

34:50.756 --> 34:52.923
what happened the night
of Mr. Slauson's death.

34:52.925 --> 34:55.625
I went to the meeting
at the Reverend's.

34:55.627 --> 34:59.663
And then after, Liam Bertrand
and I went to the Peacock
and started a fight.

34:59.665 --> 35:02.165
After you left
Reverend Shore's,

35:02.167 --> 35:05.669
did you and Mr. Bertrand proceed
directly to the Peacock Hotel?

35:05.671 --> 35:08.805
Yes. But, not together.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.074
I went straight away.

35:11.076 --> 35:13.677
Liam followed
a few minutes after.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.579
I stayed behind to speak to
the Reverend.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.747
What about?
To inform him the plan

35:17.749 --> 35:20.217
was set and the fight would
happen as expected.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.018
Hmm...

35:22.020 --> 35:24.254
Why did Mr. Cutter
not wait for you?

35:24.256 --> 35:27.124
You were both
headed to the same place.

35:27.126 --> 35:30.760
We wanted to enter the hotel
separately, as strangers,

35:30.762 --> 35:32.796
so as to make the fight
more convincing.

35:32.798 --> 35:36.533
Did you see Councilman Slauson

35:36.535 --> 35:38.535
at any point after the
conclusion

35:38.537 --> 35:41.071
of the meeting?
Briefly, yes.

35:41.073 --> 35:43.373
The Reverend asked to have one
last word with him.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.775
How long after you arrived at
the Peacock Hotel

35:45.777 --> 35:47.777
did Councilman Slauson
get there?

35:47.779 --> 35:50.280
15 minutes, maybe?

35:50.282 --> 35:52.082
I arrived first

35:52.084 --> 35:55.218
and then Liam arrived about
10 minutes after.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.888
He just had time
to down one drink

35:57.890 --> 36:00.257
and then Slauson came in.
A drink?

36:00.259 --> 36:02.792
I thought you only
pretended to drink.

36:02.794 --> 36:05.428
I was pretending.
Liam was drinking.

36:05.430 --> 36:08.598
But he is a temperancer.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.568
(laughing)
Oh, I am most certainly

36:11.570 --> 36:13.904
a temperancer.
I only drank that night

36:13.906 --> 36:15.906
because we had to make
the fight look real.

36:15.908 --> 36:18.275
I knew Charlie Cutter wouldn't
have more than a sip of lager,

36:18.277 --> 36:21.878
so it was left to me to make
sure no one suspected
it was a put-on.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.347
Ah. So you only drink

36:24.349 --> 36:27.884
when you're putting on a show,
as it were.

36:27.886 --> 36:30.120
(exhale)

36:30.122 --> 36:32.389
Well.

36:32.391 --> 36:35.625
I may have struggled with the
vice on occasion.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.827
How often would that be?

36:37.829 --> 36:40.931
Every day that I've known him.
The man's a damn drunk.

36:40.933 --> 36:44.000
He carries a flask.
A flask?

36:44.002 --> 36:46.770
Was he carrying the flask
with him that night?

36:46.772 --> 36:48.572
Yes. Well, no,

36:48.574 --> 36:51.808
he was sober at the Reverend's,
but he arrived at the Peacock

36:51.810 --> 36:54.077
already three sheets to the
wind. I mean, honestly,

36:54.079 --> 36:56.313
why do you have to have
a drink on the way to the bar?

36:56.315 --> 36:58.748
<i>If we are to believe</i>

36:58.750 --> 37:00.750
Charlie Cutter's version
of the events,

37:00.752 --> 37:03.453
we can deduce that Liam
Bertrand's flask

37:03.455 --> 37:06.323
contained the poison. Now,
Mr. Bertrand himself admitted

37:06.325 --> 37:09.793
to seeing Councilman Slauson
after the temperance event --

37:09.795 --> 37:12.128
which gives him opportunity.

37:12.130 --> 37:15.699
Wouldn't Slauson be suspicious
being offered a drink by
a temperancer?

37:15.701 --> 37:18.335
Mr. Bertrand is known to
"struggle" with his vice.

37:18.337 --> 37:21.204
Still, it seems unusual to
offer somebody a drink

37:21.206 --> 37:24.040
and not have any yourself.
Unless he did share in it.

37:24.042 --> 37:27.177
Mr. Bertrand had been drinking
before arriving to the bar.

37:27.179 --> 37:29.579
Perhaps he was drunk
on the wood alcohol --

37:29.581 --> 37:31.581
drunk on the poison itself.
But sir,

37:31.583 --> 37:33.416
if the killer himself
drank the poison,

37:33.418 --> 37:36.253
wouldn't he be as equally...
wouldn't he be dead?

37:36.255 --> 37:38.989
You're forgetting about the
antidote, Crabtree. All Bertrand

37:38.991 --> 37:41.157
had to do was down a shot of
whiskey at the hotel bar.

37:41.159 --> 37:43.960
Which he did. But the victim
had only water,

37:43.962 --> 37:45.996
which allowed the wood alcohol
to kill him.

37:45.998 --> 37:48.932
I've always said
whiskey saves lives.

37:48.934 --> 37:52.802
We are sorely
lacking in evidence.
We've been through

37:52.804 --> 37:56.106
Bertrand's house.
No sign of a flask.

37:56.108 --> 37:58.174
(drumming)

38:00.678 --> 38:03.546
Why am I still here?

38:05.950 --> 38:07.951
'Cause quite simply,
Mr. Bertrand,

38:07.953 --> 38:10.687
I believe you to be a murderer.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.956
I told you, I had
nothing to do with that.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.592
You own a flask, do you not?

38:15.594 --> 38:18.161
Of course you do,

38:18.163 --> 38:20.497
your friend Mr. Cutter
can attest to it.

38:20.499 --> 38:24.868
Yet our Constables were unable
to find a flask in your effects.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.871
Meaning what?
Meaning you disposed of it.

38:27.873 --> 38:31.308
Sensible, given that you used it
to poison a man.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.510
I did no such thing.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.312
Then why dispose of it?

38:35.314 --> 38:37.881
It's rather suspicious
behaviour, don't you think?

38:37.883 --> 38:42.752
No, I do not. Your constables
didn't find my flask, Detective,

38:42.754 --> 38:46.623
because...
my flask is right here.

39:01.038 --> 39:03.039
Whiskey?
Bourbon, in fact.

39:03.041 --> 39:05.675
Quite fine.
Have a sip if you like.

39:05.677 --> 39:09.346
Are you often in the habit
of sharing your flask,

39:09.348 --> 39:12.749
Mr. Bertrand?
No. You should
feel honoured, Detective.

39:12.751 --> 39:16.219
Did Mr. Slauson ever
receive such an honour?

39:17.955 --> 39:21.791
I can't recall.
So it's possible, then,

39:21.793 --> 39:25.095
that we would find Mr. Slauson's
fingermarks on your flask.

39:25.097 --> 39:27.764
It is possible.
He was my neighbour,

39:27.766 --> 39:30.133
we likely shared in a drink
together on occasion.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.569
Hmm... Was Tuesday evening
such an occasion?

39:32.571 --> 39:35.238
I don't recall.
Allow me to refresh

39:35.240 --> 39:37.374
your memory. It would have
been immediately after

39:37.376 --> 39:39.743
the temperance meeting at
Reverend Shore's.

39:39.745 --> 39:41.811
Do you deny it?

39:41.813 --> 39:45.382
Even if I gave him a drink,
it proves nothing.

39:45.384 --> 39:47.584
So you did.
Yes. So what?

39:47.586 --> 39:49.953
So you poisoned him,
Mr. Bertrand.

39:49.955 --> 39:52.789
That's your contention.
Actually,

39:52.791 --> 39:54.791
it's your contention.

39:54.793 --> 39:57.127
You see, if Mr. Slauson
had a drink

39:57.129 --> 40:01.831
out of this flask that evening,
it could only have been poison.

40:01.833 --> 40:05.135
Because anything else would have
been the antidote.

40:05.137 --> 40:10.006
I'll admit to nothing. And
I'll say nothing more
on the matter.

40:10.008 --> 40:13.543
It was a rather clever scheme,
Mr. Bertrand.

40:13.545 --> 40:16.579
But you've been found out.

40:16.581 --> 40:19.082
You murdered for temperance.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.084
And now you will hang for it.

40:21.086 --> 40:24.654
I did not murder for
temperance.

40:24.656 --> 40:27.857
I did it because that bastard
killed my dog.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.093
Ran him over, drunk,

40:30.095 --> 40:33.196
and meant to do it.
And worst of all,

40:33.198 --> 40:35.965
he wouldn't even admit to it
once he'd sobered up.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.034
He's never taken responsibility

40:38.036 --> 40:40.170
for a single thing he's done
in his entire life.

40:40.172 --> 40:42.872
He's not a man. He's a devil.
And he got

40:42.874 --> 40:45.141
exactly what he deserved.

40:51.415 --> 40:54.050
Goodbye, Mrs. Nation.
Have a pleasant journey.leasant.

40:54.052 --> 40:57.654
I'll do no such thing.
Nor did I have a pleasant stay.

40:57.656 --> 41:01.257
May God have mercy on your
damnable souls.

41:01.259 --> 41:03.893
Thank you.

41:06.464 --> 41:10.166
(door shutting)
What a horrid woman.

41:10.168 --> 41:14.270
I guarantee that woman drives
more men to drink than she
keeps away from it.

41:14.272 --> 41:16.673
John.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.942
Come and have a seat, son.

41:24.381 --> 41:27.984
You know, the first time that my
father caught me getting drunk,

41:27.986 --> 41:32.222
he took his belt to me.
I was your age.

41:32.224 --> 41:34.724
I've never forgotten it.

41:34.726 --> 41:37.093
But if his intention
was to stop me from drinking,

41:37.095 --> 41:39.496
it didn't work.

41:39.498 --> 41:41.598
You kept drinking
behind his back?

41:41.600 --> 41:45.535
Me and my pals knew the best
way to swipe a bottle from
every merchant in Yorkshire.

41:45.537 --> 41:48.104
Carefree, raising hell,
best days--

41:48.106 --> 41:52.575
The point is,
I may have turned out alright,

41:52.577 --> 41:55.278
but plenty of my pals
from those days didn't.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.080
Now my job is to make sure that

41:57.082 --> 41:59.883
you and Bobby don't end up
like one of them.

41:59.885 --> 42:02.318
Then again, you don't have
to be like me either.

42:02.320 --> 42:05.355
Of course
I want to be like you.
You're a smart boy, John.

42:05.357 --> 42:08.324
And I do believe
you'll become a good man.

42:08.326 --> 42:10.260
You may end up being like me

42:10.262 --> 42:13.496
or you may end up being some
teetotaling bookworm like
bloody Murdoch.

42:13.498 --> 42:15.498
(laughing)

42:15.500 --> 42:17.767
Just don't waste your youth
getting drunk.

42:17.769 --> 42:20.136
Then you can be whatever
kind of man you want.

42:20.138 --> 42:21.971
Yes, father.
Listen.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.374
You're going to make mistakes.
We all do.

42:24.376 --> 42:26.376
But maybe you should put off
making this one

42:26.378 --> 42:29.412
until you're a little bit older.
And when you do,

42:29.414 --> 42:31.414
for the love of God,

42:31.416 --> 42:34.751
don't let your mother find out.
Yes, sir.

42:34.753 --> 42:36.819
Go on.

42:44.895 --> 42:47.931
The Junction is quite a nice
town, actually.

42:47.933 --> 42:51.134
We could live here, if it
wasn't so far from the city.

42:51.136 --> 42:54.804
Imagine 30 minutes
just to get to work.

42:54.806 --> 42:58.474
Plus, it's about to go dry.
What fun is that?

42:58.476 --> 43:00.743
Well, temperance
has its virtues.

43:00.745 --> 43:02.946
A dry Canada could be quite
remarkable.

43:02.948 --> 43:05.748
How so?
With no more time wasted

43:05.750 --> 43:08.885
to the bottle, imagine
the great heights of industry

43:08.887 --> 43:11.187
and ingenuity
our nation could reach.

43:11.189 --> 43:15.391
Well, if temperance truly
is in our future,

43:15.393 --> 43:17.894
we should take advantage
of it while we can.

43:17.896 --> 43:22.198
Julia...
Just one
little drink, William.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.500
Oh, why not?

43:24.502 --> 43:27.437
Do you suppose
they have spruce beer?

43:27.439 --> 43:29.706
(piano playing)
