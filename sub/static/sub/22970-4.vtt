46:26.320 --> 46:28.000
Excuse me. Lana.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.880
Uh!

46:31.160 --> 46:33.240
Come on.

46:33.320 --> 46:34.320
Anton: Move.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.160
[Women scream]

47:05.840 --> 47:07.000
[Scoffs]

48:41.120 --> 48:43.160
[Horn honks]

48:43.240 --> 48:47.280
Jesus wept, I could've
used your help today.

48:47.360 --> 48:50.480
What a fucking fuck-up.

48:50.560 --> 48:52.840
Did you hear?

48:52.920 --> 48:55.520
I've been
suspended.

48:57.040 --> 49:01.640
Huh. What? What? What for?

49:01.720 --> 49:03.280
Moreau?

49:06.920 --> 49:08.120
What?

49:10.960 --> 49:12.920
Because and you Olivier
went behind my back.

49:14.400 --> 49:15.960
If you had something to say,

49:16.040 --> 49:17.280
you could've said it
to my face.

49:17.320 --> 49:18.760
Ok, I did try to say
it to your face,

49:18.784 --> 49:20.160
but you shut me
down.

49:20.240 --> 49:22.160
Because friends are supposed
to trust each other,

49:22.240 --> 49:23.656
and you clearly didn't trust
me to make the right decision.

49:23.680 --> 49:25.120
I was worried
about you...

49:25.200 --> 49:27.360
You don't have to be worried about me.
I'm not a child.

49:28.920 --> 49:30.176
Jacques Moreau is not eryka.
This isn't the same thing.

49:30.200 --> 49:31.480
What happened to
your face?

49:31.560 --> 49:33.680
Nothing.
Elise.

49:33.760 --> 49:36.440
Elise, come on.
Elise.

49:36.520 --> 49:38.320
[Taps on glass]

49:38.400 --> 49:41.360
And you're
a fucking hypocrite!

49:45.080 --> 49:46.680
How is what I've been doing
any different

49:46.704 --> 49:48.760
from what you've been
doing with Lana khasanovic?

49:48.840 --> 49:50.720
At least that's

49:50.800 --> 49:52.360
a live fucking murder
investigation.

49:52.440 --> 49:55.120
This is a cold case
from 8 years ago.

49:55.200 --> 49:56.800
And the perpetrators
are still out there,

49:56.824 --> 49:58.264
abusing children.

50:02.240 --> 50:03.840
I would never interfere
in your life.

50:03.920 --> 50:04.960
Wouldn't have to.

50:05.040 --> 50:07.080
Really?

50:07.160 --> 50:08.400
What's that supposed
to mean?

50:10.040 --> 50:11.160
Ask Maya.

50:11.240 --> 50:15.000
What?
Elise? Elise.

50:15.080 --> 50:17.080
