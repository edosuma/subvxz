00:11.644 --> 00:13.679
<i>I love this new house.</i>

00:13.712 --> 00:15.247
- Don't you love my pantry?

00:13.712 --> 00:15.247
- Oh, yeah.

00:15.281 --> 00:16.515
- I mean,

00:15.281 --> 00:16.515
I'm still working on it.

00:16.548 --> 00:18.251
I am starting

00:16.548 --> 00:18.251
to really like it.

00:18.283 --> 00:20.820
- Oh, it's so pretty.

00:18.283 --> 00:20.820
You got it arranged right,

00:20.853 --> 00:25.158
and these cabinets, blue.

00:20.853 --> 00:25.158
I love light colors.

00:25.190 --> 00:26.292
Oh, Lord.

00:26.326 --> 00:28.294
- What you got?

00:26.326 --> 00:28.294
- This is treasure.

00:28.327 --> 00:30.163
- Treasure. Okay.

00:28.327 --> 00:30.163
Let's see some treasure.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.765
- This is treasure.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.765
- Whose stuff is this?

00:31.797 --> 00:33.533
- I don't know.

00:31.797 --> 00:33.533
It was in the crawl space

00:33.566 --> 00:36.770
at the old house.

00:36.802 --> 00:39.371
A rotary dial phone.

00:39.405 --> 00:41.240
- What?

00:39.405 --> 00:41.240
- Look at that.

00:41.274 --> 00:44.143
- I know you love that.

00:41.274 --> 00:44.143
- But how does it even work?

00:44.176 --> 00:45.712
Like, see, like,

00:44.176 --> 00:45.712
there's a six, so do you,

00:45.744 --> 00:47.280
like, go around six times,

00:47.313 --> 00:50.283
then around four times,

00:47.313 --> 00:50.283
then around seven times?

00:50.316 --> 00:52.317
- Oh, have done...

00:50.316 --> 00:52.317
- [laughs]

00:52.351 --> 00:54.320
- And how do you, like,

00:54.353 --> 00:56.256
talk to more

00:54.353 --> 00:56.256
than one person at a time?

00:56.289 --> 00:58.158
- If you were on the phone

00:56.289 --> 00:58.158
and somebody else tried

00:58.191 --> 00:59.625
to call you,

00:58.191 --> 00:59.625
you got the busy signal.

00:59.658 --> 01:00.859
- Yeah.

00:59.658 --> 01:00.859
- Or they got the busy signal.

01:00.893 --> 01:03.596
- It would go, "Beep, beep."

01:00.893 --> 01:03.596
- What?

01:03.630 --> 01:06.266
- Yeah.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.266
- But if the phone was busy

01:06.299 --> 01:08.635
a lot then you could go

01:06.299 --> 01:08.635
to the operator,

01:08.668 --> 01:10.804
and you would say, "Yes, I have

01:08.668 --> 01:10.804
an emergency phone call."

01:10.837 --> 01:12.237
You remember that?

01:10.837 --> 01:12.237
- Oh, yeah.

01:12.272 --> 01:13.472
- He would do that

01:12.272 --> 01:13.472
all the time.

01:14.606 --> 01:15.174
- And then when she'd be on

01:14.606 --> 01:15.174
on the phone, they'd say,

01:16.275 --> 01:17.176
"We have an emergency phone

01:16.275 --> 01:17.176
call for Faye Chrisley."

01:18.144 --> 01:19.611
I'd say, "Yes, this is Stan

01:18.144 --> 01:19.611
from Duke Power.

01:20.780 --> 01:20.813
I was calling to see if

01:20.780 --> 01:20.813
your refrigerator is running."

01:21.614 --> 01:22.448
And she would say,

01:21.614 --> 01:22.448
"Well, yeah."

01:23.450 --> 01:25.185
I'd say, "Well, you better

01:23.450 --> 01:25.185
catch that bitch."

01:25.218 --> 01:26.853
- He can't give me enough

01:25.218 --> 01:26.853
to pay for all the [bleep]

01:26.885 --> 01:28.487
I've been through with him.

- Mama.

01:39.832 --> 01:41.334
- Yes.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.235
- I'm just curious

01:41.367 --> 01:43.235
what are these little balls?

01:43.269 --> 01:45.771
- Nasty-ass quinoa,

01:43.269 --> 01:45.771
which I hate.

01:45.805 --> 01:47.873
- You're going to love it

01:45.805 --> 01:47.873
when I mix it all together.

01:47.906 --> 01:49.442
- We don't eat quinoa.

01:49.475 --> 01:51.478
- Well, I just want you

01:49.475 --> 01:51.478
to try it for me.

01:51.510 --> 01:53.513
- I don't want to.

01:51.510 --> 01:53.513
I tried that years ago.

01:53.545 --> 01:55.414
- Yeah, I know, but I told you

01:53.545 --> 01:55.414
I perfected it.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.915
- I didn't like--

01:55.448 --> 01:56.915
you can't perfect sand.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.251
- Oh, gosh.

01:58.283 --> 01:59.918
- Sand and water

01:58.283 --> 01:59.918
is still sand and water.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.388
- Okay.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.388
There's no way I can get this.

02:01.421 --> 02:03.689
- Chase, grab this bowl.

02:01.421 --> 02:03.689
Grab that bowl up there.

02:07.659 --> 02:10.530
Reach!

02:10.562 --> 02:11.698
- Grayson, get up

02:11.730 --> 02:13.199
and get the bowl.

02:11.730 --> 02:13.199
- I got it.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.335
- He's pushed it farther away.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.335
- I can get it.

02:15.367 --> 02:17.569
- No, your brother has got it.

02:15.367 --> 02:17.569
- Move.

02:17.603 --> 02:19.406
- Move out of the way

02:17.603 --> 02:19.406
and let a grown man get it.

02:19.438 --> 02:20.740
- Oh, shut up.

02:20.774 --> 02:24.243
[laughter]

02:24.276 --> 02:25.645
- Thank you, G.

02:24.276 --> 02:25.645
- Just so you know,

02:25.679 --> 02:26.780
I could have gotten that.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.682
- He is taller than you.

02:29.716 --> 02:32.618
- So he's a little bit taller

02:29.716 --> 02:32.618
than me, like, an inch or two.

02:32.651 --> 02:34.219
Look, that doesn't matter.

02:34.253 --> 02:36.723
- An inch or two will decide

02:34.253 --> 02:36.723
whether or not you have

02:36.756 --> 02:39.626
a great marriage

02:36.756 --> 02:39.626
or just an "eh" marriage.

02:39.658 --> 02:41.127
- Oh, my God.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.594
- Is that why you had

02:41.161 --> 02:42.594
that surgery?

02:42.628 --> 02:44.264
- [laughs]

02:44.296 --> 02:46.566
- Chase, you're fun sized.

02:46.598 --> 02:48.268
- I am so sick and tired

02:48.300 --> 02:49.836
of y'all picking on me

02:48.300 --> 02:49.836
for my height

02:49.868 --> 02:52.204
like it's some reflection

02:49.868 --> 02:52.204
of my masculinity.

02:52.237 --> 02:55.408
It's not, and now Grayson

02:52.237 --> 02:55.408
wants to jump on the bandwagon,

02:55.442 --> 02:57.310
act like he's, like,

02:55.442 --> 02:57.310
the big man on campus

02:57.343 --> 02:59.145

02:59.179 --> 03:01.348
- Chase, he is though.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.348
He's the big man.

03:01.381 --> 03:03.616
You're the little one.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.485
he might be taller,

03:05.518 --> 03:07.454
but he's not stronger,

03:05.518 --> 03:07.454
and that's a fact.

03:07.486 --> 03:09.355
- I could take you any day.

03:07.486 --> 03:09.355
- Well, Grayson,

03:09.389 --> 03:11.324
if you're so damn strong

03:09.389 --> 03:11.324
then come and join Savannah

- It wasn't about her hair,

these days, Daddy?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.235
Once a week, twice a week?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.803

with once every six weeks

04:30.836 --> 04:32.372
if I didn't have kids.

11:12.438 --> 11:15.174
Hello!

11:12.438 --> 11:15.174
- This smells good.

11:15.207 --> 11:18.177
- We even got donuts.

11:15.207 --> 11:18.177
- Good morning, darling.

11:18.211 --> 11:22.782
- Good morning.

11:18.211 --> 11:22.782
- You're the love of my life.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.384
- Why are you whispering?

11:24.417 --> 11:25.719
- Because I have been told

11:25.751 --> 11:28.879
that I have a loud voice,

11:28.120 --> 11:30.356
maybe sometimes yell.

11:30.389 --> 11:35.729
So I'm going to speak

11:30.389 --> 11:35.729
very quiet, calm, loving.

11:35.761 --> 11:37.263
Now, what would you like, Gray?

11:37.297 --> 11:39.432
- My dad back.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.600
- Okay, here you go.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.336
Put your little bit

11:40.633 --> 11:43.336
of syrup on there.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.404
- Darling, I'm in

11:43.370 --> 11:45.404
a very generous mood.

11:45.437 --> 11:47.606
I want to take you

11:45.437 --> 11:47.606
for anything that you want:

11:47.639 --> 11:49.743
ice cream, shopping.

11:49.775 --> 11:51.443
- Yes!

11:51.477 --> 11:53.346
- Can I not get in

11:51.477 --> 11:53.346
on this generous mood?

11:53.379 --> 11:55.715
- Grayson,

11:53.379 --> 11:55.715
this is about your sister.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.851
So now that I've been so good

11:55.749 --> 11:58.851
about doing your breakfast

11:58.884 --> 12:00.854
and I'm gonna take you

11:58.884 --> 12:00.854
and let you do what you want,

12:00.886 --> 12:05.158
maybe you can now rewrite your

12:00.886 --> 12:05.158
story about the Botox monster.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.726
I would prefer

12:05.191 --> 12:07.726
the Botox prince,

12:07.760 --> 12:09.162
even princess.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.629
I'm good with either.

12:10.663 --> 12:13.466
- Dad, don't hold your breath.

12:10.663 --> 12:13.466
- [laughs]

12:13.500 --> 12:20.730
<i>* *</i>

12:20.105 --> 12:22.174
- I love this place.

12:20.105 --> 12:22.174
What are you gonna get?

12:22.207 --> 12:23.475
- I'm going to get

12:22.207 --> 12:23.475
black coffee.

12:23.509 --> 12:25.211
- You don't drink black coffee.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.846
- But it puts hair

12:25.245 --> 12:26.846
on your chest.

12:26.879 --> 12:28.782
- It's a figure of speech.

12:26.879 --> 12:28.782
You understand that, right?

12:28.815 --> 12:31.183
- I heard chicks love it when

12:28.815 --> 12:31.183
a guy has hair on his chest.

12:31.216 --> 12:32.485
- Let me tell you something.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.586
Chrisley men do not have hair

12:32.519 --> 12:34.586
on their chest.

12:34.620 --> 12:36.155
We wax.

12:36.188 --> 12:41.561
<i>* *</i>

12:41.594 --> 12:44.330
- I come here all the time,

12:41.594 --> 12:44.330
and she's always working.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.731
- So that's why

12:44.364 --> 12:45.731
you wanted to come.

12:45.764 --> 12:48.668
- Yeah, she's cute.

12:45.764 --> 12:48.668
- Mm. Okay.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.336
- I'm getting nervous.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.404
- Big man is not so confident

12:50.370 --> 12:52.404
anymore.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.375
Come on.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.375
- I can't take you anywhere.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.644
- I've never been this excited

12:55.408 --> 12:57.644
to order coffee.

12:57.677 --> 13:00.212
- Hi, you guys. Welcome in.

12:57.677 --> 13:00.212
- Thank you. How are you?

13:00.245 --> 13:01.447
- So good.

13:00.245 --> 13:01.447
What can I get started for you?

13:01.480 --> 13:04.417
- Um, I think my little brother

13:01.480 --> 13:04.417
wants a--what do you want?

13:04.451 --> 13:05.652
- A black coffee.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.652
- Black coffee.

13:05.684 --> 13:07.253
- Black coffee? All right.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.221
- Can we get some milk

13:07.287 --> 13:08.221
on the side

13:08.254 --> 13:10.423
'cause he thinks he's grown.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.826
It was yesterday

13:10.456 --> 13:13.826
I was changing his diapers.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.294
- I love your necklace.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.294
What is that?

13:15.327 --> 13:16.528
- It's a lightning bolt.

13:16.562 --> 13:18.597
- A lightning bolt.

13:16.562 --> 13:18.597
Why lightning bolts?

13:18.630 --> 13:21.167
<i>* *</i>

13:21.201 --> 13:22.802
- Because he's got an arm

13:21.201 --> 13:22.802
like a cannon.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.336
Right?

13:22.836 --> 13:24.336
- There we go.

13:24.370 --> 13:25.605
- There you go.

13:24.370 --> 13:25.605
- It's very cool.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.840
- You come up right off

13:25.638 --> 13:26.840
the top of the head.

13:26.873 --> 13:29.208
You got to have it.

13:29.241 --> 13:31.543
Grayson might have the sports

13:29.241 --> 13:31.543
down to a T,

13:31.577 --> 13:34.413
but when it comes to talking

13:31.577 --> 13:34.413
to the ladies, he's garbage,

13:34.447 --> 13:37.750
and let's face it, that's what

13:34.447 --> 13:37.750
separates the boys from men.

13:37.783 --> 13:39.586
- Of course, he's awkward when

13:37.783 --> 13:39.586
it comes to talking to girls.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.321
I mean, he's 14.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.623
- I wasn't.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.623
- Chase, you were a nerd.

13:43.655 --> 13:44.624
- Savannah, no I wasn't.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.625
I was making out with girls

13:44.657 --> 13:46.625
all over seaside.

13:46.658 --> 13:48.561
- Yeah.

13:48.595 --> 13:49.596
- You want anything else?

13:49.629 --> 13:50.596
- No.

13:49.629 --> 13:50.596
- You sure?

13:50.629 --> 13:51.730
- Yeah. I'm good.

13:51.764 --> 13:52.532
- You want her number

13:51.764 --> 13:52.532
or something?

13:52.565 --> 13:54.466
- No.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.802
- All right. Thank you, guys.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.802
- Absolutely. Have a good one.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.572
- What was that?

13:56.836 --> 13:59.572
- Stop being so sensitive.

13:59.605 --> 14:00.874
- I don't know why you got

13:59.605 --> 14:00.874
to say stuff like that.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.644
<i>[light, cheery music]</i>

14:05.678 --> 14:08.114
<i>* *</i>

14:08.148 --> 14:09.749
- So you know that place

14:08.148 --> 14:09.749
in Texas.

14:09.783 --> 14:15.754
Is it Texakarna or Texakana?

14:15.788 --> 14:20.326
- It's Texarkana.

14:15.788 --> 14:20.326
Why do they call it Texarkana?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.394
- I don't know.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.394
- Savannah, where is Texas?

14:22.428 --> 14:25.565
- Down, to the side.

14:22.428 --> 14:25.565
- What?

14:25.597 --> 14:28.100
- It's, like, that way.

14:25.597 --> 14:28.100
- What does it border?

14:28.134 --> 14:29.568
- Well, it borders the ocean,

14:28.134 --> 14:29.568
clearly.

14:29.601 --> 14:31.303
Like, the ocean is on one side,

14:31.337 --> 14:34.407
and then the other part

14:31.337 --> 14:34.407
up top is Arkansas

14:34.441 --> 14:36.576
'cause you have

14:34.441 --> 14:36.576
to drive through.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.510
- You're brilliant.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.510
- I know. I get it.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.513
[door shuts]

14:40.547 --> 14:42.182
- Help me finish this

14:40.547 --> 14:42.182
because I just heard your mom

14:42.215 --> 14:44.616
get home with Chloe.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.616
Doesn't this look good?

14:44.650 --> 14:46.318
- Yes, Daddy.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.318
It looks so great.

14:46.352 --> 14:47.386
- Hello.

14:47.419 --> 14:48.554
- Hey.

14:47.419 --> 14:48.554
- Hi.

14:48.587 --> 14:51.624
- Oh, you're so cute.

14:48.587 --> 14:51.624
How was school?

14:51.658 --> 14:53.158
- Chloe, I bet you had

14:51.658 --> 14:53.158
the hardest day

14:53.192 --> 14:54.793
at school today, didn't you?

14:54.827 --> 14:57.297
- Yeah, it was stressful.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.264
- And that's why we're gonna

14:57.330 --> 14:59.264
have a spa day.

14:59.298 --> 15:01.567
Look at all the stuff

14:59.298 --> 15:01.567
that I set up for you.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.370
- Look at your slippers.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.370
I love those.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.272
- And your robe.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.272
Let's put your little robe on.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.674
- That's so cute.

15:08.707 --> 15:12.177
- The breakfast didn't work,

15:08.707 --> 15:12.177
so now I've got to up my game.

15:12.211 --> 15:15.315
Hence the daddy classic:

15:12.211 --> 15:15.315
a spa day.

15:15.347 --> 15:17.817
I mean, I don't know.

15:15.347 --> 15:17.817
I mean, will the spa day work?

15:17.850 --> 15:19.351
Will this do the trick?

15:19.385 --> 15:21.539
- I think you might have

15:19.385 --> 15:21.539
a better chance at this.

15:21.870 --> 15:22.187
- There's really not an option

15:22.221 --> 15:25.625
because I refuse

15:22.221 --> 15:25.625
to be the villain.

15:25.658 --> 15:26.493
- I mean, does this look

15:26.525 --> 15:28.227
like something

15:26.525 --> 15:28.227
that a monster would do?

15:28.260 --> 15:30.596
- No.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.596
- No. Not at all.

15:30.629 --> 15:32.798
Tie that up.

15:32.831 --> 15:35.668
- Chloe, look over here.

15:32.831 --> 15:35.668
Look at the nail polish.

15:35.701 --> 15:38.138
Look, the watermelon one.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.338
- Does it smell like

15:38.171 --> 15:39.338
watermelon?

15:39.371 --> 15:40.639
- Yeah.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.143
- Okay.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.143
Time for our facial treatment.

15:45.779 --> 15:49.615
- No. The Botox monster.

15:45.779 --> 15:49.615
I'm out of here.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.786
- Chloe.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.786
- Chloe!

15:52.818 --> 15:54.153
- I don't look like a monster.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.121
Do you understand

15:54.187 --> 15:56.121
this is a $100 mask?

15:56.155 --> 15:58.692
- You are too much.

15:56.155 --> 15:58.692
- I'm not wasting this mask.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.131
<i>- Okay, Chloe.</i>

16:03.296 --> 16:06.131
<i>Time to get ready for bed.</i>

16:06.899 --> 16:08.335
- Hey, darling. Come sit by me.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.169
Don't you love your room?

16:10.202 --> 16:11.303
- Yes.

16:11.337 --> 16:12.605
- And wait until your drapes

16:11.337 --> 16:12.605
come in

16:12.639 --> 16:14.274
because they have butterflies

16:12.639 --> 16:14.274
all over them.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.274
- [gasps]

16:14.307 --> 16:15.274
- Really?

16:15.307 --> 16:16.275
- Yep.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.379
- This is going to be

16:16.308 --> 16:19.379
the land of butterflies.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.809
- Chloe.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.809
- Yeah?

16:21.114 --> 16:23.515
- We were a little worried

16:21.114 --> 16:23.515
with you running out earlier.

16:23.549 --> 16:25.485
I'm sorry if I scared you

16:25.518 --> 16:27.553
because

16:25.518 --> 16:27.553
that was never my intention.

16:27.586 --> 16:28.721
- Honey, was something

16:27.586 --> 16:28.721
bothering you?

16:28.754 --> 16:30.590
<i>* *</i>

16:30.623 --> 16:34.661
- Dad, I don't want

16:30.623 --> 16:34.661
to get Botox.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.328
I really don't like needles.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.639
Are you gonna stick it

16:36.363 --> 16:38.639
in my face?

16:38.980 --> 16:41.600
- No, honey, you're not gonna

16:38.980 --> 16:41.600
have any needles in your face.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.336
- Poor thing. She thought she

16:41.634 --> 16:44.336
was gonna have to get Botox.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.373
- You don't ever have

16:44.370 --> 16:46.373
to worry about that.

16:46.405 --> 16:48.375
- This makes total sense now.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.844
She hates going to the doctor

16:48.408 --> 16:50.844
to get shots.

16:50.876 --> 16:53.546
- The allergy shots,

16:50.876 --> 16:53.546
they helped you,

16:53.580 --> 16:57.616
and I need the Botox

16:53.580 --> 16:57.616
to help with my allergies.

16:57.649 --> 16:59.519
- Really?

16:57.649 --> 16:59.519
- Yes.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.653
I have this allergic reaction

16:59.552 --> 17:01.653
to age.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.723
- [laughs]

17:04.758 --> 17:06.226
So I'm not scary anymore?

17:06.259 --> 17:09.729
- Mm-mm.

17:06.259 --> 17:09.729
- There you go.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.297
I'm so glad to find out

17:11.330 --> 17:12.798
that this was just

17:11.330 --> 17:12.798
a misunderstanding

17:12.832 --> 17:15.349
because, I mean,

17:12.832 --> 17:15.349
Chloe is not afraid of me.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.603
She's just afraid of needles.

17:16.635 --> 17:19.720
- I think this been a learning

17:16.635 --> 17:19.720
lesson for both of us.

17:19.105 --> 17:22.174
I think it's good to remember

17:19.105 --> 17:22.174
that kids hear everything,

17:22.208 --> 17:24.309
and their little minds

17:24.344 --> 17:26.746
internalize it

17:24.344 --> 17:26.746
completely differently

17:26.779 --> 17:27.713
than the way that we do.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.315
So moving forward,

17:29.348 --> 17:30.616
we just need

17:29.348 --> 17:30.616
to really be mindful

17:30.650 --> 17:32.419
of what she's exposed to.

17:32.451 --> 17:33.686
- So what you're saying is

17:33.720 --> 17:35.154
that she shouldn't

17:33.720 --> 17:35.154
be hanging with mama.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.457
- Well, probably not.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.358
- Are you gonna stop

17:37.490 --> 17:39.358
getting Botox?

17:39.392 --> 17:40.794
- Honey, do you understand

17:40.826 --> 17:43.730
that if I didn't do Botox

17:43.762 --> 17:47.200
so many people would realize

17:43.762 --> 17:47.200
how I really feel about them?

17:47.232 --> 17:50.269
- It comes through even though

17:47.232 --> 17:50.269
your face doesn't move.

17:50.302 --> 17:51.604
[laughs]

17:51.637 --> 17:56.409
<i>* *</i>

17:56.442 --> 17:58.278
- So are we gonna

17:56.442 --> 17:58.278
use these books?

17:58.310 --> 17:59.846
- No, because those

17:58.310 --> 17:59.846
are antiques,

17:59.878 --> 18:02.382
and I want to use things that

17:59.878 --> 18:02.382
are transitional down here.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.150
- Okay, so what are we supposed

18:02.414 --> 18:04.150
to do with all these books?

18:04.183 --> 18:05.317
They've already been--

18:04.183 --> 18:05.317
- Well, we're gonna save them

18:06.353 --> 18:08.153
and let one of the kids

18:06.353 --> 18:08.153
have them when I die.

18:08.188 --> 18:11.657
- Okay. Okay. That's funny.

18:08.188 --> 18:11.657
- What's funny?

18:11.691 --> 18:12.592
- I just think it's funny

18:12.625 --> 18:14.394
that you think our kids

18:12.625 --> 18:14.394
would read books.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.729
- Julie, I don't think

18:14.426 --> 18:15.729
they would read books,

18:15.761 --> 18:18.597
but they would sniff money.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.432
- Hey, bud.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.432
- Hello, little boy.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.469
- How is it going?

18:20.467 --> 18:22.469
- Seriously, stop.

18:22.501 --> 18:25.372
What are y'all doing

18:22.501 --> 18:25.372
with all those Bibles?

18:25.404 --> 18:27.740
- They're not Bibles.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.740
- Those are antique books.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.242
- I need those.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.242
- For what?

18:30.276 --> 18:32.450
- Those are worth

18:30.276 --> 18:32.450
a lot of money.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.279
- What did I tell you?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.279
- Oh, my gosh.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.481
- Where's Grayson at?

18:35.515 --> 18:37.584
- He's been upstairs

18:35.515 --> 18:37.584
in his room all day.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.519
- Now, when I was his age,

18:39.849 --> 18:40.529
I wasn't allowed to be

18:39.849 --> 18:40.529
in my room all day.

18:40.859 --> 18:42.422
- Well, that's because

18:40.859 --> 18:42.422
you didn't have somebody

18:42.454 --> 18:43.823
picking on you all the time.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.424
- Mm-hmm.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.424
- Oh, my gosh.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.826
How have I hurt his feelings?

18:46.859 --> 18:49.229
- What did you do

18:46.859 --> 18:49.229
at the coffee shop?

18:49.261 --> 18:52.231
- Are you kidding me?

18:49.261 --> 18:52.231
I was just messing with him.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.267
- You should not be doing

18:52.265 --> 18:54.267
things like that.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.434
You shouldn't be--

18:55.468 --> 18:58.837
you should be literally setting

18:55.468 --> 18:58.837
an example for him, son.

18:58.872 --> 19:00.740
- I mean,

18:58.872 --> 19:00.740
you are the big brother.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.709
You know

19:00.773 --> 19:02.709
that he looks up to you.

19:02.741 --> 19:04.644
- Well, not technically.

19:04.678 --> 19:06.445
- And that's another reason why

19:04.678 --> 19:06.445
because y'all have done nothing

19:06.479 --> 19:07.579
but make fun of me

19:06.479 --> 19:07.579
my whole life.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.115
- No, we love you,

19:07.614 --> 19:10.115
and you know that,

19:10.150 --> 19:12.519
but I'm sorry

19:10.150 --> 19:12.519
if you feel that way

19:12.849 --> 19:14.253
'cause I know

19:12.849 --> 19:14.253
I mess with you pretty hard.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.122
- Well--

19:14.287 --> 19:16.122
- But if you didn't like it...

19:16.155 --> 19:17.156
- Right.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.291
- Why would you think he would?

19:19.325 --> 19:21.528
- That's fair.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.528
That's a valid point.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.130
I'll admit,

19:21.560 --> 19:24.130
I wish I was a little taller.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.432
- I haven't noticed.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.432
- But it's not Grayson's fault,

19:26.465 --> 19:28.335
and I really shouldn't have

19:26.465 --> 19:28.335
taken it out on him.

19:28.367 --> 19:30.236
Going forward

19:28.367 --> 19:30.236
I'm gonna treat Grayson

19:30.269 --> 19:32.305
the way that I would like

19:30.269 --> 19:32.305
to be treated.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.750
- I give it up to you.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.750
You are a great big brother,

19:35.107 --> 19:38.377
and you're teaching Grayson

19:35.107 --> 19:38.377
the right way to do things.

19:40.145 --> 19:41.614
- Oh, there's no but?

19:40.145 --> 19:41.614
- But--

19:41.647 --> 19:43.282
- Nope. Nope. Nope!

19:43.316 --> 19:45.518
- You should have done

19:43.316 --> 19:45.518
that all along.

19:45.551 --> 19:47.287
Should have done it all along.

19:45.551 --> 19:47.287
- Nope!

19:47.319 --> 19:49.355
- Just be the bigger man here.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.569
- All right,

19:49.388 --> 19:51.569
well, I'll go apologize to him.

19:51.910 --> 19:52.558
- Okay. Thank you.

19:52.592 --> 19:53.625
- Isn't he the cutest

19:52.592 --> 19:53.625
little thing?

19:53.660 --> 19:55.950
Like a little pocket pal.

19:55.127 --> 19:56.663
- I heard that.

19:59.499 --> 20:02.469
<i>[bright classical music]</i>

20:02.836 --> 20:06.538
<i>* *</i>

20:06.573 --> 20:08.674
- So are you just wearing hats

20:06.573 --> 20:08.674
all the time now?

20:08.708 --> 20:11.144
- Pretty much.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.145
- You notice anything

20:11.176 --> 20:13.145
different?

20:13.179 --> 20:14.413
- You look a little bit taller.

20:14.446 --> 20:17.150
- Yep because

20:14.446 --> 20:17.150
I got them insoles,

20:17.182 --> 20:20.452
but I'm never wearing them

20:17.182 --> 20:20.452
again because holy [bleep]

20:20.487 --> 20:22.756
these things hurt.

20:22.788 --> 20:25.724
Look, I wanted to apologize

20:22.788 --> 20:25.724
because I'm sorry

20:25.759 --> 20:28.761
that I kind of embarrassed

20:25.759 --> 20:28.761
you the last time we were here.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.497
I made you feel uncomfortable,

20:30.529 --> 20:32.731
and there's no reason for you

20:30.529 --> 20:32.731
to feel uncomfortable.

20:32.766 --> 20:34.701
I mean, you're young.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.736
You're good-looking.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.736
You're an athlete.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.704
You'll be fine, but I want you

20:36.769 --> 20:38.704
to know something.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.307
No matter how tall you get,

20:38.738 --> 20:41.307
I will always be here for you.

20:41.340 --> 20:43.410
I always got your back.

20:41.340 --> 20:43.410
You know that.

20:43.442 --> 20:45.545
Look right there.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.248
That's your girl.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.284
Go put our order in

20:48.280 --> 20:51.284
and talk to her. Do it.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.353
- Oh, my God.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.353
- What?

20:53.385 --> 20:54.721
- I'm starting to

20:53.385 --> 20:54.721
get nervous again.

20:54.753 --> 20:58.324
- Grayson, just be yourself.

20:58.357 --> 21:02.362
Even though Grayson is tall,

20:58.357 --> 21:02.362
he's still my little brother,

21:02.394 --> 21:04.230
my little big brother,

21:04.263 --> 21:05.765
but if they ever come out

21:04.263 --> 21:05.765
with a surgery,

21:05.798 --> 21:08.468
I'm on that list.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.135
- Thank you so much

21:08.500 --> 21:10.135
for coming in.

21:10.170 --> 21:11.438
Hi.

21:10.170 --> 21:11.438
- Hi.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.239
- The guy with

21:11.471 --> 21:13.239
the lightning bolt necklace.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.708
- Yeah.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.708
My brother gave it to me.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.241
- Good older brother

21:14.740 --> 21:16.241
right there.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.144
- Sometimes.

21:18.178 --> 21:19.846
- Depends on the day.

21:18.178 --> 21:19.846
- Yeah.

21:19.878 --> 21:21.647
Oh, I can imagine.

21:19.878 --> 21:21.647
I've got a brother too,

21:21.681 --> 21:24.217
but I think it's different when

21:21.681 --> 21:24.217
it's two brothers, you know?

21:24.250 --> 21:27.453
- Yeah.

21:27.487 --> 21:31.910
- So when do you get off work?

21:27.487 --> 21:31.910
- That's my little brother.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.659
He's killing it, right? Yeah.
