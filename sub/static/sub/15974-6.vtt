01:51:03.895 --> 01:51:05.590
to the Meadowlands
and do a pre-interview.

Since when do we do
pre-interviews?

01:51:07.098 --> 01:51:08.259
Since we
booked Chris Patrick.

01:51:08.333 --> 01:51:10.392

Christian Patrick

01:51:10.468 --> 01:51:13.904

exposing himself to a woman.</i>

01:51:13.972 --> 01:51:15.872

-- What?

01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:18.773
Natalie will deny reports that she was
sexually assaulted in an empty locker room,

01:51:18.843 --> 01:51:22.711

as well as press inquiries.

I'm already
out of the loop.

01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:31.852
You touch her again,
I'm gonna have you killed.

01:51:31.923 --> 01:51:34.290
But tomorrow, the sky's gonna
fall down on both of us.

01:51:34.359 --> 01:51:36.123
I'm going over to
the 23rd precinct,

01:51:36.194 --> 01:51:38.458

-- What if you were wet?
-- I'd be very cold.

01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:11.454
But as cold as I'd be
under that circumstance,

01:52:11.529 --> 01:52:14.191

any discernable difference

and how cold I am now.

-- I'm pretty cold.

bit more like Elmer Fudd.

Natalie's right. If this
is professional television,

01:52:50.034 --> 01:52:51.798

-- when something like this happens.
-- Absolutely.

-- I haven't put these in any order.
-- Okay.

01:53:14.359 --> 01:53:17.522

-- I'm conversationally anal-retentive?
-- Yes, indeed.

01:53:20.531 --> 01:53:22.021
Then what are your
other two complaints?

01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:23.829
If I did number them,
certainly high on the list

01:53:23.901 --> 01:53:25.699
would be the climate
in this room.

01:53:25.770 --> 01:53:27.534
Yeah, I think your p0sition's
pretty clear on that.

what are the other two'?</i>

-- I can't <i>find it.</i>

That's good, um,
but the problem

01:54:56.627 --> 01:54:58.755
we're having in the studio
is with the heat.

Or do you think it's just safer for
everybody if I don't do anything?

01:55:10.575 --> 01:55:11.872
No, I was just --

01:55:26.858 --> 01:55:29.293

I stand by my position.

01:55:36.133 --> 01:55:38.067
I do it proudly,
I do it vigorously,

01:55:38.135 --> 01:55:39.569

three reasons --

<i>Why are you looking
at a dictionary?</i>

01:55:45.343 --> 01:55:47.209
I don't think "pundit" means
what you think it means.

01:55:47.278 --> 01:55:49.372
-- You're not gonna let go of this.
-- You're not gonna let <i>go</i> of <i>this.</i>

01:55:49.447 --> 01:55:51.814
Excuse me, but wasn't I sitting next
to you for two weeks when you said

01:55:51.883 --> 01:55:54.648
that Latrell Sprewell shouldn't be allowed
to play professional basketball again?

01:55:54.719 --> 01:55:56.551
Look, I know
it's your alma mater,

01:55:56.621 --> 01:55:59.488
and I know you take that seriously
-- and I think that's great --

01:55:59.557 --> 01:56:02.720
but Rostenkowski blew a fourth-down
call in a college football game.

01:56:02.793 --> 01:56:05.763
Latrell Sprewell tried
to strangle his coach.

01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:08.731
Is this one of those days when you have
a hard time making the distinction?

01:56:08.799 --> 01:56:11.393
We were this close to
beating Miami -- this close.

01:56:11.469 --> 01:56:13.631
Do you know how many times
we've beaten Miami?

01:56:13.704 --> 01:56:16.105
-- You've never beaten Miami.
-- We've never beaten Miami.

01:56:16.173 --> 01:56:17.902
Now, who am I supposed to
see about that?

01:56:17.975 --> 01:56:19.773

01:56:19.844 --> 01:56:21.334

I found it.

01:56:28.586 --> 01:56:30.816
I knew if I looked hard enough,
I'd find it, and I found it.

-- <i>What did you find?</i> -- <i>A death threat.</i>
-- <i>To Natalie?</i>

01:56:33.591 --> 01:56:36.253
Yes. Anytime you've got a thousand people
sending letters and making phone calls,

01:56:36.327 --> 01:56:38.955
it's a pretty good bet that at least one
of them's gonna be out of his mind.

01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:40.964
Jeremy, is this why you haven't
been sleeping at night?

01:56:41.032 --> 01:56:43.501
-- I <i>don't</i> need <i>much sleep.</i> -- <i>I
don't want you obsessing about this.</i>

01:56:43.568 --> 01:56:46.162
-- <i>It's not</i> an <i>obsession.</i> -- <i>You look
like you haven't slept in</i> a <i>week.</i>

01:56:46.237 --> 01:56:48.296
-- <i>I'm fine.</i> -- <i>'Cause, you
know, network security's</i>

01:56:48.372 --> 01:56:51.034
working with the FBI, and they
pretty much have the bases covered.

01:56:51.108 --> 01:56:52.473
Well, they don't have
the bases covered,

01:56:52.543 --> 01:56:54.102
because I intercepted
this e-mail this morning.

01:56:54.178 --> 01:56:56.272
You shouldn't be reading
Natalie's e-mail.

01:56:56.347 --> 01:56:57.542
It was the only way
I could make sure

01:56:57.615 --> 01:56:59.014
that Natalie doesn't
read Natalie's e-mail.

01:56:59.083 --> 01:57:00.414
I'm surprised she gave
you her password.

01:57:00.484 --> 01:57:01.474
She won't even
give it to me.

01:57:01.552 --> 01:57:03.213
She didn't give it to me.
I figured it out.

01:57:03.287 --> 01:57:04.516
-- You figured it out?
-- Sure.

01:57:04.589 --> 01:57:06.182
You figured out
her password?

01:57:06.257 --> 01:57:08.658
I thought, you know, how many
6-letter words could there be?

01:57:08.726 --> 01:57:10.057
Um, 5,000.

01:57:10.127 --> 01:57:12.027
<i>14,200 and change.</i>

01:57:12.096 --> 01:57:13.530
But I got it on
the 38th try.

01:57:13.598 --> 01:57:15.157

right now.

-- No, I don't want her seeing it!
-- Jeremy... listen, do me a favor.

01:57:44.962 --> 01:57:47.397
Go wait for me in the conference room.
I want to talk to you.

-- I need to be doing something.
-- You will be.

-- Go wait in the conference room.
-- Listen...

01:57:51.202 --> 01:57:53.569
You're overtired.
This is sleep deprivation.

01:57:53.638 --> 01:57:56.232
Go to the conference room
and wait for me there.

01:57:56.307 --> 01:57:58.105
I'm sorry
I raised my voice.

01:58:01.178 --> 01:58:02.509
We shouldn't worry,
right?

[Door closes]

01:58:03.781 --> 01:58:05.476

has a run-in
with an athlete,

01:58:07.084 --> 01:58:08.609
the reporter
becomes the story.

01:58:08.686 --> 01:58:09.949
That happens, right?

01:58:10.021 --> 01:58:11.182
<i>In my experience?</i>

01:58:11.255 --> 01:58:13.087
About twice a year
over the last 40 years.

01:58:13.157 --> 01:58:14.215
<i>Right.</i>

01:58:14.291 --> 01:58:16.885
So why does this
feel different?

01:58:16.961 --> 01:58:18.895
Because it's
happening to us.

01:58:18.963 --> 01:58:21.159
Right.

01:58:21.232 --> 01:58:22.893
Okay, the budget.

-- Yeah, four of <i>them.</i>

-- <i>You made that up.</i>
-- <i>What's that say?</i>

-- It's addressed to Dan. -- Yeah, well,

01:59:04.842 --> 01:59:06.606
-- Casey...
-- I'm leading a groundswell.

01:59:06.677 --> 01:59:07.974
That's really nice
for you.

Listen, do me a favor --
double-check any items

01:59:10.147 --> 01:59:11.615
you're getting in
from Natalie.

01:59:11.682 --> 01:59:13.172
If anything's wrong,
fix it yourself.

01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:14.979
The distractions are
starting to get to her.

01:59:15.052 --> 01:59:17.214
Oh, yeah. She's been screwing
up pretty good lately.

01:59:17.288 --> 01:59:19.848
Yeah, not like when you were
going through the divorce.

01:59:19.924 --> 01:59:21.187
I did my job
with a plum.

01:59:21.258 --> 01:59:23.852
I remember some days you could
barely find the building.

01:59:23.928 --> 01:59:25.089
Well, that's true.

01:59:25.162 --> 01:59:26.891
-- You'll watch her back?
-- I always do.

01:59:26.964 --> 01:59:28.022
I know.

01:59:28.099 --> 01:59:29.464
Good.

01:59:29.533 --> 01:59:30.694
I need to get in there.

01:59:30.768 --> 01:59:32.236
-- You look nice today.
-- Good.

01:59:32.303 --> 01:59:33.930
Uh, uh, uh, uh --
no, no, no.

01:59:34.004 --> 01:59:36.336
I said you look nice. That's
your cue to say thank you.

01:59:36.407 --> 01:59:37.465
Thank you.

01:59:37.541 --> 01:59:38.667
Why do you look nice?

01:59:38.743 --> 01:59:40.006
Because I am nice.

01:59:40.077 --> 01:59:41.841
-- You can say it, Dana.
-- I don't want to say it.

01:59:41.912 --> 01:59:44.006
-- You do want to say it. -- I don't want
to say it, and you don't want me to say it.

01:59:44.081 --> 01:59:46.209
I do want you to say it,
and then I want you to see

01:59:46.283 --> 01:59:47.808
how much I don't
care when you do.

01:59:47.885 --> 01:59:49.444
-- What's in it for me?
-- Nothing.

01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:50.954
I am dressed this way

01:59:51.021 --> 01:59:54.514
because I'm having dinner
with Gordon after the show.

01:59:54.592 --> 01:59:56.788
I'm having dinner with Gordon,
and I'm dressed this way

01:59:56.861 --> 01:59:58.158
because it's been
my experience

01:59:58.229 --> 01:59:59.958
that when I do, Gordon
becomes quite amorous,

02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:03.261
and it's my hope that Gordon act
on his impulses this evening,

02:00:03.334 --> 02:00:06.201
quench his desire,
and in so doing...

02:00:06.270 --> 02:00:08.432
[Sighs ] quench mine.

02:00:08.506 --> 02:00:09.439
You happy?

02:00:09.507 --> 02:00:11.100
That's all I wanted.

02:00:11.175 --> 02:00:13.269
-- Good. -- There is no reason
for you to be secretive.

02:00:13.344 --> 02:00:15.176
-- Fine. -- I am not
jealous of you and Gordon.

02:00:15.246 --> 02:00:18.216
-- Can I get in the conference room?
-- Sure.

02:00:18.282 --> 02:00:20.410
-- Kim...
-- Yep?

02:00:20.484 --> 02:00:21.747
Make a note --

02:00:21.819 --> 02:00:23.184
I need to ruin
Dana's dinner with Gordon.

02:00:23.254 --> 02:00:24.722
<i>Dana: You know, Jeremy...</i>

02:00:24.789 --> 02:00:28.316
Don Quixote was a hero of my father's,
and my father would like you.

02:00:28.392 --> 02:00:30.121
You're a very
Quixotic character.

02:00:30.194 --> 02:00:33.289
-- Thank you. -- However, my father
would also say you're a fool.

02:00:33.364 --> 02:00:36.925
That's entirely possible, but in
own defense, so was Don Quixote.

02:00:37.001 --> 02:00:39.026
-- You like Natalie, don't you?
-- Me?

02:00:39.103 --> 02:00:40.298
-- Yes.
-- Of course I like her.

02:00:40.371 --> 02:00:41.736
No, that's not
what I mean, Jeremy.

02:00:41.806 --> 02:00:43.296
I mean, you <i>like</i>
Natalie, don't you?

02:00:43.374 --> 02:00:44.136
-- Me?
-- Yes.

02:00:44.208 --> 02:00:45.073
What was the question?

02:00:45.142 --> 02:00:47.201
-- It's okay.
-- I haven't --

02:00:47.278 --> 02:00:49.645
It's okay. I'm sure your love has
been pure and chaste from afar.

02:00:49.713 --> 02:00:51.477
-- It really has been. --
I'll let you in on a secret.

02:00:51.549 --> 02:00:53.017
I think Natalie
likes you as well.

02:00:53.083 --> 02:00:54.175
-- I think so, too.
-- Yes.

02:00:54.251 --> 02:00:55.741
-- I've been getting that feeling.
-- Good.

02:00:55.820 --> 02:00:57.310
I've had this sense.
It's a faint, subtle thing --

02:00:57.388 --> 02:00:58.822
She's been throwing
herself at you.

02:00:58.889 --> 02:01:00.687
-- See, I didn't get that.
-- Trust me.

02:01:00.758 --> 02:01:02.726
So, you know what
I think you should do?

02:01:02.793 --> 02:01:04.261
-- What?
-- Nothing.

02:01:04.328 --> 02:01:05.762
-- Nothing?
-- Nothing.

02:01:05.830 --> 02:01:07.764
-- Isn't that what I'm doing now?
-- No.

02:01:07.832 --> 02:01:09.425
Natalie's life has been
turned upside down.

02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:11.195
She doesn't know whether
she's coming or going.

02:01:11.268 --> 02:01:13.259
People harass her
and take her pictures.

02:01:13.337 --> 02:01:15.101
The reporters calling,
the mail --

02:01:15.172 --> 02:01:16.765
She's frightened
and confused.

02:01:16.841 --> 02:01:18.570
And I know
you're frightened, too,

02:01:18.642 --> 02:01:20.474
or you wouldn't be
staying up all night

02:01:20.544 --> 02:01:22.410
plugging 6-letter words
into a computer.

02:01:22.479 --> 02:01:23.640
I'm not a big man, Dana.

02:01:23.714 --> 02:01:26.081
I can't beat people up,
and I don't carry a gun.

02:01:26.150 --> 02:01:29.176
I'm a research analyst with a
degree in Applied Mathematics,

02:01:29.253 --> 02:01:30.516
so this is what I do.

02:01:30.588 --> 02:01:32.750
And that's cool, but
that's not what she needs.

02:01:32.823 --> 02:01:33.619
What does she need?

02:01:33.691 --> 02:01:36.183
A quiet dinner --
just a quiet dinner

02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:39.059
in a safe place
with someone she likes.

02:01:39.129 --> 02:01:39.789
Who?

02:01:39.864 --> 02:01:41.025
-- Me, right.
-- Jeremy...yes.

02:01:41.098 --> 02:01:42.156
-- I can do that.
-- Good.

02:01:42.233 --> 02:01:43.826
-- I can definitely do that.
-- Excellent.

02:01:43.901 --> 02:01:45.892
-- Now I need you to do something else.
-- Sure.

02:01:45.970 --> 02:01:47.301
Go into my office,
close the door,

02:01:47.371 --> 02:01:49.271
lie down on the couch,
and take a nap.

02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:50.569
-- I can't.
-- You can try.

02:01:50.641 --> 02:01:52.735
-- No, I can't sleep.
-- You can try for a few hours.

02:01:52.810 --> 02:01:53.971
These letters aren't
gonna stop coming

02:01:54.044 --> 02:01:55.068
just because I take her
out to dinner.

02:01:55.145 --> 02:01:56.306
I know.

02:01:56.380 --> 02:01:59.111
I'll try and sleep.

02:01:59.183 --> 02:02:01.948
-- 14,200?
-- And change.

02:02:02.019 --> 02:02:04.147
“Very Quixotic,“ my father
would say about you.

02:02:08.659 --> 02:02:10.684
<i>Casey: Hey, you know what
Danny said to me last night?</i>

02:02:10.761 --> 02:02:12.695
<i>What'd you say
to him last night?</i>

02:02:12.763 --> 02:02:14.561
I told him he was
conversationally anal-retentive.

02:02:14.632 --> 02:02:16.031
-- Yeah, you are.
-- I am not.

02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:17.932
-- You are, too. -- You guys
need me for this fight?

02:02:18.002 --> 02:02:19.697
-- No.
-- No, we're fine.

02:02:19.770 --> 02:02:21.738
How am I conversationally
anal-retentive?

02:02:21.805 --> 02:02:23.569
Let me answer that
question in four parts

02:02:23.641 --> 02:02:25.803
with the fourth part first
and the third part last.

02:02:25.876 --> 02:02:28.573
-- The second part has five syllables.
-- All right, all right, all right.

02:02:28.646 --> 02:02:29.977
Hey, did you talk
to the sound guys

02:02:30.047 --> 02:02:31.606
about the Rostenkowski
effects for tonight?

02:02:31.682 --> 02:02:33.172
-- The crash-and-burn sound?
Yeah. -- Yeah.

02:02:33.250 --> 02:02:34.877
-- And?
-- They said they don't have it.

02:02:34.952 --> 02:02:37.011
-- They don't have the crash-and-burn
sound? -- They don't have it.

02:02:37.087 --> 02:02:38.612
Well, did you make
the sound for them?

02:02:38.689 --> 02:02:41.283
Yes. Hey, Elliott, who's the leading
scorer in the Portland game?

02:02:41.358 --> 02:02:42.757
-- McManus.
-- Okay.

02:02:42.826 --> 02:02:45.056
You made the sound for them,
and they didn't have it?

02:02:45.129 --> 02:02:46.119
-- That's right.
Uh-huh.

02:02:46.196 --> 02:02:48.392
Kim, where are we
on Sergei Fedorov?

02:02:48.465 --> 02:02:50.263
-- When did you need that?
-- Now.

-- Yeah.

-- Really?
-- Yes.

02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:57.471
Make the sound
that you made.

02:02:57.541 --> 02:02:59.009

-- Make it.

That's not the sound.

02:03:06.083 --> 02:03:07.175
That's the sound.

-- Huh?

02:03:27.371 --> 02:03:28.839
Dana said you were asleep
in her office.

02:03:28.906 --> 02:03:30.874
No, I've been, uh, running
some stats through a program.

02:03:30.941 --> 02:03:32.670
I'm trying to chose
an appropriate restaurant.

02:03:32.743 --> 02:03:35.269
Listen to me, seriously.
You gotta get some sleep.

02:03:35.346 --> 02:03:37.371
I once stayed up 72 hours straight
studying for a Bioohem midterm.

02:03:37.448 --> 02:03:39.007
-- You know what happened next?
-- No.

02:03:39.083 --> 02:03:40.141
<i>Me neither, man,</i>

02:03:40.217 --> 02:03:41.412
'cause I passed out in
my girlfriend's dorm room.

02:03:41.485 --> 02:03:43.214
I didn't wake up
until, like, graduation.

02:03:43.287 --> 02:03:45.449
-- <i>How'd you do on the midterm?</i> -- <i>I
aced it, but that's not the point.</i>

02:03:45.522 --> 02:03:48.150
-- <i>What's the point?</i> -- <i>You're
running stats on restaurants?</i>

02:03:48.225 --> 02:03:50.694
I want to take Natalie to dinner,
and I want to do it right.

02:03:50.761 --> 02:03:53.594
I wrote some software that helps me
factor in menu, ambiance, location,

02:03:53.664 --> 02:03:56.463
any number of elements that can be
translated into binomial functions.

02:03:56.533 --> 02:03:58.865
<i>It's based on the fourth
generation of L7 software</i>

02:03:58.936 --> 02:04:00.836
that runs with the old
Omni applications.

02:04:00.904 --> 02:04:03.373
It doesn't allow for trends, and it's
not as fast as I'd like it to be,

02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:05.568
-- <i>but it's...</i> -- Hang on,
hang on, hang on. Time out.

02:04:05.642 --> 02:04:08.373
Let me just get this
straight here. I'm sorry.

02:04:08.445 --> 02:04:09.708
You designed
some software?

02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:11.680
-- Just an application.
-- Jeremy...

02:04:11.749 --> 02:04:14.480
See, Dana seems to think that I could
help Natalie out if I take her to dinner.

02:04:14.551 --> 02:04:16.417
-- Dan, this may be my only chance
with Natalie. -- Listen up. Listen up.

02:04:16.487 --> 02:04:18.387
-- You know what she likes, and you know all
the hot places in the city. -- Jeremy...

02:04:18.455 --> 02:04:20.355
-- Please, help me pick a
restaurant -- -- Jeremy, listen up!

02:04:20.424 --> 02:04:21.550
Okay.

02:04:21.625 --> 02:04:24.026
You need to go to sleep.

02:04:24.094 --> 02:04:26.324
It's dangerous...

02:04:26.397 --> 02:04:28.161
Really.

02:04:28.232 --> 02:04:29.495
Okay.

02:04:38.976 --> 02:04:40.944
Make it someplace
that you like.

02:04:42.413 --> 02:04:45.405
Restaurants -- they don't impress
women as much as we think they do,

02:04:45.482 --> 02:04:47.473
and food always tastes
good on the first date.

02:04:47.551 --> 02:04:50.111
You're not in Vegas,
and you're not in I.A.

02:04:50.187 --> 02:04:54.522
You are in the most
magnificent city in the world.

02:04:54.591 --> 02:04:56.582
It's the city of Gershwin
and Cole Porter,

02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:58.458
Damon Runyon and
Fiorello La Guardia.

02:04:58.529 --> 02:05:00.691
Surprise her, but
make her feel comfortable.

02:05:00.764 --> 02:05:03.199
Make it different, but
make her feel at home.

02:05:03.267 --> 02:05:04.530
But mostly...

02:05:04.601 --> 02:05:07.593
make it someplace
that you like.

02:05:07.671 --> 02:05:09.935
Where is that restaurant?

02:05:11.575 --> 02:05:13.236

Hey, Gordon.
What's happening?

02:05:28.826 --> 02:05:31.193
Oh, boy, this place really
hops at showtime, huh?

02:05:31.261 --> 02:05:32.922
It's like a real
television show.

02:05:32.996 --> 02:05:35.192
-- Yeah, we got cameras and everything.
-- VVow.

02:05:35.265 --> 02:05:36.664
Honey, I gotta go
check on some things.

02:05:36.733 --> 02:05:38.701
You don't have to talk to
Casey if you don't want to,

02:05:38.769 --> 02:05:40.328
and if he says anything
you don't like,

02:05:40.404 --> 02:05:42.338
you should feel free
to take a swing at him.

02:05:42.406 --> 02:05:44.602

Feisty girl.

02:05:44.675 --> 02:05:46.109
Yeah, she's a pip.

02:05:46.176 --> 02:05:47.871
Oh, I gotta tell you, when
she wears that outfit --

02:05:47.945 --> 02:05:49.003
I heard.

02:05:49.079 --> 02:05:50.569
Oh, by the way,
for what it's worth,

02:05:50.647 --> 02:05:52.479
I'm right with you on this
Rostenkowski thing.

02:05:52.549 --> 02:05:53.948
-- Thank you.
-- It was a terrible call.

02:05:54.017 --> 02:05:56.179
-- Lost the game. -- I don't
know how he makes that call.

02:05:56.253 --> 02:05:59.052
Any idiot knows you hand it to
Jermaine, you send him up the middle.

02:05:59.123 --> 02:06:00.887
Yeah -- well, you're
not gonna go up the middle

02:06:00.958 --> 02:06:02.357
against an 8-man front,
but still...

02:06:02.426 --> 02:06:04.360
Oh, still, maybe you run
a play-action fake,

02:06:04.428 --> 02:06:06.522
you toss it off to the
tight end out in the flat.

02:06:06.597 --> 02:06:09.066
The problem with that is that without
establishing a running game first,

02:06:09.133 --> 02:06:12.000
-- no one's gonna bite down on
the play fake. -- Oh, <i>but</i> stiff.

02:06:12.069 --> 02:06:13.537
Still...

02:06:13.604 --> 02:06:14.935
A post pattern,
a slant...

02:06:15.005 --> 02:06:16.803
He'd be going against
a defensive back

02:06:16.874 --> 02:06:19.969
who was second-team All-American
as a true freshman.

02:06:20.043 --> 02:06:22.137
-- What would you have called?
-- Me?

02:06:22.212 --> 02:06:23.976

02:06:26.416 --> 02:06:28.407
The thing is, I haven't
watched film all week.

02:06:28.485 --> 02:06:30.010
I haven't seen
scouting reports.

02:06:30.087 --> 02:06:32.579
I don't have an offensive
coordinator talking in my ear.

02:06:32.656 --> 02:06:34.681
I don't have 80,000 fans
screaming in my face.

02:06:34.758 --> 02:06:37.659
<i>So it's easy for me -- I
don't have 10 million people</i>

a pack of rabid alumni.

02:06:40.764 --> 02:06:42.858
I've had three days
to think about it.

02:06:42.933 --> 02:06:44.401
He had seven seconds.

02:06:44.468 --> 02:06:47.369
So it's a lot easier for me to make
that decision than it was for him.

02:06:47.437 --> 02:06:50.168
<i>But since you asked me what play I
would have called, I'll tell you.</i>

02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:53.175

the man was of Latin descent,

02:08:05.349 --> 02:08:06.908
you'd be incorrect as well.

some kind of charity?

02:10:57.988 --> 02:10:59.353
No, not charity.

02:10:59.423 --> 02:11:01.983
I just wanted to do
something.

02:11:02.058 --> 02:11:02.991
Why?

02:11:03.059 --> 02:11:04.652
I like you.

[Sighs]

02:11:12.602 --> 02:11:15.367
You look awfully
tired, Jeremy.

02:11:15.439 --> 02:11:18.534
When was the last time
you slept?

02:11:18.608 --> 02:11:19.939
I don't really remember.

02:11:20.010 --> 02:11:21.535
Is that because of me?

02:11:21.611 --> 02:11:23.602
Yeah.

02:11:24.915 --> 02:11:28.146
Look, I'll clean this stuff up.
It'll take a second.

02:11:28.218 --> 02:11:31.017
Sit down.

02:11:31.087 --> 02:11:33.215
Come on.

02:11:33.290 --> 02:11:35.122
Lie down here.

02:11:35.192 --> 02:11:37.559
Put your head here.

02:11:40.597 --> 02:11:42.497
You guys have
something better to do?

02:11:42.566 --> 02:11:45.035
-- No, not really. -- I don't
have anything to do. -- No.

02:11:46.303 --> 02:11:48.931
-- Oh. -- Yes, I do.
I have a -- 0h, God.

02:11:49.005 --> 02:11:51.133
I have that thing --
that thing.

02:11:53.977 --> 02:11:55.741
I'll see you
in the morning.

02:11:55.812 --> 02:11:58.008
Listen, he's gonna be
asleep for a while,

02:11:58.081 --> 02:11:59.913
and I wouldn't mind
the company.

02:11:59.983 --> 02:12:01.815
You want to have
a drink with me?

02:12:01.885 --> 02:12:02.977
Gee, yeah, I would,

02:12:03.053 --> 02:12:04.748
but I've got Gordon
waiting in the greenroom,

02:12:04.821 --> 02:12:06.220
and we're going out
to dinner.

02:12:06.289 --> 02:12:08.053
I'll see you
in the morning.

02:12:11.795 --> 02:12:13.058
Natalie...

02:12:13.129 --> 02:12:15.029
-- Yeah? -- You've been
screwing up all week,

02:12:15.098 --> 02:12:16.327
and it's gotta stop.

02:12:16.399 --> 02:12:18.697
Get your act together
and do it fast. Got it?

02:12:18.768 --> 02:12:20.702
-- Yes, ma'am.
-- Good.

02:12:20.770 --> 02:12:22.397
Thanks.

02:12:22.472 --> 02:12:25.373
You're welcome.
