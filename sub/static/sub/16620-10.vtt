a cat agent last week

00:47.548 --> 00:49.054

00:49.079 --> 00:50.460
on our way to the Soup Buffet.

And he thinks Mr.
Business has what it takes

00:52.434 --> 00:55.553
to be the next spokes-cat
for Chef Cat cat food.

- Not really.

01:04.828 --> 01:06.564
When the original Chef Cat died,

01:06.589 --> 01:08.639
they found another cat
that looked just like him.

01:08.664 --> 01:10.401
And then after that and then after that.

01:10.426 --> 01:11.925
They just kept replacing him.

01:11.977 --> 01:13.760

Oh, by the way, Lin, I need to borrow

01:20.028 --> 01:22.129
just a little more money from you

01:38.860 --> 01:40.527
- She did?
- Oh, it was nothing.

01:40.552 --> 01:43.671
- It was barely nothing, it was...
- It was $222.

01:43.696 --> 01:45.246
- It was?
- Well, that... no.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.071
No, it wasn't that much.

01:47.096 --> 01:48.117
Here's the receipt, right here.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.531
Linda, can I talk to you in the kitchen?

01:49.594 --> 01:50.977
No...

01:51.062 --> 01:53.014
Lin, I thought we decided to pull back

01:53.039 --> 01:54.288
on lending Gayle money.

01:54.373 --> 01:55.679
- Oh, did we?
- Yes!

01:55.704 --> 01:58.087
- But she hardly ever asks for money.
- What?!

Tina get to have a box?

02:34.132 --> 02:36.941
- Yeah!
- Huh, Gayle must have left that here

02:36.966 --> 02:38.640
the last time she brought her cats over.

02:38.665 --> 02:40.679
This cat really does
look like Mr. Business.

02:40.704 --> 02:43.147
- Yeah, he kind of does.
- See, Bob?

02:43.172 --> 02:45.023
I told you that cat agent wasn't lying.

02:45.048 --> 02:46.867
Yeah, they look alike,
but that still doesn't mean

02:46.875 --> 02:50.274
Gayle should... we should give
a bunch of money to this guy.

02:50.299 --> 02:52.009
We don't even know if he's a real agent.

02:52.034 --> 02:53.642
He seems pretty legit to me.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.462
He had a business card and everything.

Anyone can have a card, Lin.
Teddy has a card.

- Gene.

- No.

- You take a check?

could get Mr. Business

08:18.644 --> 08:20.727
to knock the spice jar
into the pot ourselves,

08:20.813 --> 08:22.896
we should probably
forget the whole thing.

08:22.982 --> 08:24.481
- What?!
- Son of a bitch!

08:24.506 --> 08:26.639
Oh, well. We tried.

08:26.664 --> 08:30.037
- You're still the puss in my boots.
- (Mr. Business meows)

08:30.122 --> 08:32.205
W-Wait, wait, you're
just gonna give up?

08:32.291 --> 08:34.291
- Yeah.
- That's the spirit!

08:34.326 --> 08:36.659
You have a chance to
start making $40,000 a year

08:36.712 --> 08:38.294
for doing literally almost nothing,

08:38.330 --> 08:40.464
and you're gonna give up after one try?

08:40.499 --> 08:42.332
- Seems like.
- No, no, Gayle,

08:42.357 --> 08:43.974
let my client out, I
want to talk to him.

08:44.053 --> 08:45.697
Gayle, no, we can't
have cats on the counter.

08:45.721 --> 08:47.323
Gayle, let him out.

08:48.047 --> 08:49.881
Mr. Business, get back in the crate.

08:50.059 --> 08:51.842
- (purrs)
- Whoa, Dad.

08:51.927 --> 08:53.904
- What?
- He did exactly what you said.

08:53.929 --> 08:55.729
You are a cat whisperer.

08:55.814 --> 08:57.397
Yeah, Dad, you're really good at that.

08:57.483 --> 08:58.682
I almost got in the crate.

08:58.734 --> 08:59.983
(gasps) That's it!

09:00.019 --> 09:01.518
Dad, you could teach Mr. Business

09:01.604 --> 09:02.769
to knock over the thing.

09:02.855 --> 09:04.271
You could be his trainer!

09:04.356 --> 09:06.106
Huh, yeah, maybe.

09:06.191 --> 09:08.253
And I bet if you could train
him to knock over the jar,

09:08.277 --> 09:09.660
Ian would still represent us.

09:09.695 --> 09:11.528
I mean, I-I'd need to
take my allergy pills.

09:11.580 --> 09:12.996
Which makes me nervous

09:13.032 --> 09:14.726
because they say don't
mix them with alcohol,

09:14.750 --> 09:17.367
and I always mix them with alcohol.

09:17.419 --> 09:18.835
Eh, I don't know.

09:18.871 --> 09:21.872
Maybe Mr. Business just wasn't
meant to hit the big-time.

09:21.924 --> 09:23.874
What?! With those looks and that ass?

09:23.926 --> 09:25.459
Oh, come on, Gayle.

09:25.544 --> 09:27.878
- Couldn't you use the money?
- Sure, I guess.

09:27.930 --> 09:29.796
I could buy some more cats finally.

09:29.882 --> 09:31.515
(sighs) All right.

09:31.550 --> 09:33.967
Looks like I'm the new cat trainer.

09:34.053 --> 09:35.747
What do you say, Mr.
Business? You want to be

09:35.771 --> 09:37.220
the next Chef Cat cat food cat?

09:37.306 --> 09:38.555
No one is eating cat food!

09:38.641 --> 09:40.223
God, why would you even say that?

09:40.309 --> 09:42.943
- N-No one said that, Tina.
- I know.

09:43.028 --> 09:45.112

10:02.631 --> 10:04.930
That's weird, that thing you're doing.

10:04.955 --> 10:06.508
P-Pushing your paw.

10:06.533 --> 10:09.002
I-It kind of hurts, 'cause
you're really pressing.

10:09.088 --> 10:10.387
It's also kind of nice, though.

10:10.422 --> 10:12.255
Look, Mr. Business, (groans)

10:12.341 --> 10:14.007
I know you're probably tired of me

10:14.093 --> 10:17.119
trying to get you to knock
over that stupid jar. I get it.

10:17.144 --> 10:19.407
I-I don't like doing what
people tell me to do either.

10:19.431 --> 10:21.064
That's why I have my own restaurant.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.633
So, don't do it because I want you to.

10:23.658 --> 10:24.935
Do it for you.

10:24.987 --> 10:26.570
I mean, this could be good for you.

10:26.605 --> 10:27.729
You make your own money.

10:27.754 --> 10:30.084
See the world. You can
move away from Gayle.

10:30.109 --> 10:31.408
Just kidding.

10:31.443 --> 10:33.110
I-I know you like her. She's nice.

10:33.162 --> 10:34.389
So, what do you say,
huh? You-you want to go

10:34.413 --> 10:35.696
knock over a jar?

10:35.781 --> 10:38.252
Hmm? Who wants to knock the jar over?

10:38.277 --> 10:40.277
You do!

10:42.166 --> 10:43.503
Yes! Yes! You did it!

10:43.589 --> 10:44.421
Mr. Business! (yowling)

10:44.456 --> 10:46.873
Ow, ow! Oh, God, ow!

10:46.898 --> 10:48.166
(sneezes): Oh... oh, God!

10:51.533 --> 10:53.880
Oh, Bob, Linda, Gayle.

10:53.966 --> 10:56.016
Um, what are you doing here?

10:56.101 --> 10:57.384
Hey, Ian, Snoodle.

10:57.469 --> 10:59.219
Look, I know there was an incident

10:59.304 --> 11:02.272
the other day with Mr. Business,
but we've been working together,

11:02.307 --> 11:04.119
and you won't believe
this, but he's actually able

11:04.143 --> 11:05.308
to knock over the spices.

11:05.394 --> 11:07.068
Right. Um...

11:07.696 --> 11:10.147
- Uh, who's that?
- Yeah, who's that?

11:10.172 --> 11:13.627
Ah, this is Fluffy, and
this is her cat Jessica.

11:13.652 --> 11:16.653
Uh, Jessica looks a
lot like Mr. Business.

11:16.739 --> 11:18.705
She doesn't, Bob. She
looks like Chef Cat.

11:18.791 --> 11:22.318
So you'll be representing
both of us at the auditions?

11:22.411 --> 11:23.744
I'm afraid not, Bob.

11:23.829 --> 11:25.879
What? But-but he can do the thing now!

11:25.964 --> 11:27.497
He can do it. Show him, Bob.

11:27.583 --> 11:30.967
That cat is a loose
cannon. You saw what he did.

11:31.003 --> 11:32.836
Not anymore, Ian. I trained him.

11:32.888 --> 11:35.131
Uh, please, Bob. You're
not a professional.

11:35.156 --> 11:37.067
Oh, so you're just gonna help any cat

11:37.092 --> 11:38.725
who looks like Chef Cat... Is that it?

11:38.811 --> 11:40.811
Uh, no, Bob. I'm going to help Jessica.

11:40.846 --> 11:42.679
And I'm, by the way, in a serious

11:42.731 --> 11:44.314
committed relationship with Fluffy now.

11:44.349 --> 11:46.233
So you get people's hopes up,

11:46.318 --> 11:47.768
make them believe in something,

11:47.793 --> 11:51.223
and then toss them aside when
you find a younger hotter cat?

11:51.256 --> 11:52.663
Bob, you calm down now.

11:52.691 --> 11:55.242
You know what? We're going to
that audition without you, Ian.

11:55.327 --> 11:56.804
- We are?
- Yes, we are, Gayle.

11:56.829 --> 11:58.662
I am going to get Mr. Business

11:58.697 --> 12:01.331
to knock over that spice
jar in front of the judges.

12:01.366 --> 12:03.166
- Producers!
- Whatever!

12:03.202 --> 12:04.709
But he's not very good at it.

12:04.734 --> 12:07.014
He's great at it! Occasionally. Once.

12:07.039 --> 12:08.672
You won't stand a chance, Bob.

12:08.707 --> 12:11.174
Please, do not embarrass
the cat like that.

12:11.210 --> 12:13.210
- We don't have to take this.
- No, we don't.

12:13.262 --> 12:14.544
- Come on, Lin.
- Yeah.

12:14.630 --> 12:16.179
Bob, can I come, too?

12:16.215 --> 12:17.547
Yes, Gayle, you come with us.

12:17.633 --> 12:19.850
Yay. And I should bring the cat?

12:19.885 --> 12:21.529
- Yes, Gayle, it's your cat!
- LINDA: Yeah, come on.

12:21.553 --> 12:24.271
Okay. Bye, Ian. Bye, Fluffy.

12:24.356 --> 12:25.388
Can we just leave?!

12:25.440 --> 12:26.640
Get the cat. Get the cat.

12:26.725 --> 12:28.225
Oh, my God, get out!

12:28.277 --> 12:29.893
We're trying!

12:33.600 --> 12:35.209
(quietly): I can't
even look at this food.

12:35.233 --> 12:38.985
(quietly): I know. No crunch, no
tuna flavor. This is garbage.

12:39.010 --> 12:41.571
- I can't believe we're out of Chef Cat.
- So what do we do?

12:41.596 --> 12:43.266
Maybe this is our wake-up call.

12:43.291 --> 12:46.082
Maybe we should, you know,
try to stop eating cat food?

12:46.107 --> 12:47.994
(whispers): I have been
throwing up on the rug.

12:48.079 --> 12:50.130
So let's do it. We'll
just have a normal day

12:50.165 --> 12:52.132
where we don't think
about cat food at all.

12:52.167 --> 12:54.551
Everybody ready to go to
the cat food audition today?

12:54.636 --> 12:56.553
- Oh, damn it!
- Attagirl!

12:56.638 --> 12:58.505
- (doorbell rings)
- Uh, uh, there's Gayle.

12:58.590 --> 13:00.673
Time to go. Come on, kids. Time to go.

13:00.725 --> 13:03.176
I'm about to go from "meow" to me rich.

13:03.228 --> 13:05.053
Let's go, Team Business!

13:07.592 --> 13:10.607
Wow, a lot of people here.
A lot of cats.

13:10.632 --> 13:12.123
And they all look like Mr. Business.

13:12.148 --> 13:13.139
Except for that one.

13:13.164 --> 13:15.281
- Get out of here, Garfield!
- Yeah!

13:15.925 --> 13:18.506
Dad, which cats look like
the biggest competition?

13:18.531 --> 13:20.295
You point them out,
I'll get in their heads.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.797
We don't have any competition, Louise.

13:21.822 --> 13:23.906
Mr. Business is gonna
win this, no problem.

13:23.931 --> 13:26.599
Hey, Mr. Biz, how you holding up?

13:26.633 --> 13:29.678
Gayle, please don't rile him up
right now. We need him focused.

13:29.703 --> 13:31.636
I'm just checking on him, Bob.

13:31.903 --> 13:33.709
Okay, you're opening up the carrier.

13:33.734 --> 13:35.818
Oh, no, he's licking his tummy!

13:35.843 --> 13:37.693
He does that when he's unhappy.

13:37.718 --> 13:40.569
Look. Oh, my gosh, a
patch of fur is missing.

13:40.594 --> 13:42.594
I guess. It's a little
thin there, but...

13:42.619 --> 13:44.678
Has he been doing this all week, Bob?

13:44.703 --> 13:46.014
Uh, I don't know.

13:46.039 --> 13:47.232
I thought when he licked his tummy,

13:47.257 --> 13:49.092
that's just him getting psyched up.

13:49.117 --> 13:50.533
Uh, yeah, that's right.

13:50.576 --> 13:51.920
No, this is bad, Bob.

13:51.945 --> 13:53.713
Please, Gayle, you're
making him nervous.

13:53.738 --> 13:56.906
I am not. I make him angry, not nervous.

13:56.958 --> 13:58.041
(mewling)

13:58.076 --> 13:59.409
Oh, I'm worried about this, Bob.

13:59.461 --> 14:00.910
Something's wrong.

14:00.962 --> 14:02.912
Uh, Louise, uh, didn't
you want to go get

14:02.964 --> 14:05.081
a soda at the soda machine?

14:05.133 --> 14:08.001
And also you wanted
someone to go with you?

14:08.086 --> 14:10.169
Oh, right, right. Right, yes.

14:10.255 --> 14:14.007
Aunt Gayle, will you please
go to the soda machine with me?

14:14.092 --> 14:16.092
You push the buttons so well.

14:16.144 --> 14:18.177
- I do?
- You do.

14:18.263 --> 14:20.563
I use my elbow because of the germs.

14:20.599 --> 14:22.265
- Okay, go. Go, go, go.
- Okay.

14:22.290 --> 14:24.007
Go have fun at the soda machine.

14:24.102 --> 14:26.519
I'm excited. I didn't
know I was so good at it.

14:26.544 --> 14:29.355
(sighs) Okay, Mr. Business, pep talk.

14:29.380 --> 14:31.880
Listen, first of all, haters gonna hate.

14:31.993 --> 14:33.776
And there's nothing
you can do about that.

14:33.828 --> 14:36.112
(chuckles) Good thing
we're totally over cat food,

14:36.164 --> 14:37.758
because otherwise this
would be a nightmare.

14:37.782 --> 14:40.166
Yep. Oh, God, there's a lot of cat food.

14:40.191 --> 14:41.529
- Free samples of cat food.

14:41.554 --> 14:43.271
Look, there's Mom! Let's ask her

14:43.296 --> 14:44.571
to chain us up like werewolves

14:44.623 --> 14:46.381
to protect us from ourselves.

14:46.709 --> 14:47.707
Mother!

14:47.792 --> 14:49.259
- (gasps)
- Are you...

14:49.294 --> 14:50.760
You're eating Chef Cat!

14:50.795 --> 14:52.128
Uh, what the... uh, oh.

14:52.213 --> 14:53.596
I-I am.

14:53.632 --> 14:55.515
(laughs) What a crazy...

14:55.600 --> 14:57.767
I mean, who would eat
cat food? Who does that?

14:57.802 --> 14:59.385
- What flavor is it?
- Cheese 'n' Chicken.

14:59.471 --> 15:00.451
- Hand it over.
- No.

15:00.476 --> 15:01.752
- Yes.
- Fine.

15:01.940 --> 15:04.357
- (sighs)
- Gimme.

15:04.442 --> 15:05.545
Wait a second.

15:05.570 --> 15:08.672
Mom, was that your box of
Chef Cat under the sink?

15:08.697 --> 15:10.146
Yeah. So what?

15:10.231 --> 15:13.066
I like to have a little cat food
to relax every once in a while.

15:13.151 --> 15:14.450
Is that a crime? Give it back.

15:14.486 --> 15:16.452
(gasps) Our addiction is genetic!

15:16.488 --> 15:18.955
I'm not to blame! I'm a cat food baby.

15:18.990 --> 15:20.907
I never had a chance.

15:20.992 --> 15:24.709
And that little boy who didn't
make the basketball team was me.

15:24.734 --> 15:28.631
So don't be me, be you,
because you've got that edge,

15:28.667 --> 15:30.667
you've got that attitude and spark,

15:30.719 --> 15:32.669
and, I've learned a lot from you.

15:32.754 --> 15:36.005
Sometimes I feel like you're
the teacher and I'm the cat.

15:36.279 --> 15:38.591
Um... the end.

15:38.677 --> 15:40.593
I have to go (coughs) get some water

15:40.679 --> 15:42.889
'cause I'm allergic to you, and
I've been talking a long time.

15:45.016 --> 15:46.399
- Ian.
- Hello, Bob.

15:46.484 --> 15:48.184
I saw you over there.

15:48.209 --> 15:49.902
Giving the cat a pep talk?

15:49.988 --> 15:51.708
That's good, good for,
good for both of you.

15:51.773 --> 15:53.053
That'll really make a difference.

15:53.108 --> 15:54.108
Oh, really?

15:54.133 --> 15:56.219
No, of course not, Bob. It's a cat.

15:56.244 --> 15:58.328
Don't try and get in my head, Ian.

15:58.363 --> 16:00.780
I don't need to, Bob.
You're not going to win.

16:00.805 --> 16:03.593
Yes, we are. You
aren't going to beat us.

16:03.618 --> 16:05.535
Oh, okay. Good comeback, Bob.

16:05.587 --> 16:06.502
Bye-bye, Bob.

16:06.538 --> 16:08.705
No, bye-bye to you, Ian.

16:08.757 --> 16:10.206
Bye-bye to you, Bob.

16:10.291 --> 16:11.708
Oh, no! Bye-bye to you, Ian!

16:11.793 --> 16:13.793
Oh, oh,
bye-bye! Bye-bye!

16:13.878 --> 16:15.795
Bye-bye with my hand in your face!

16:15.880 --> 16:17.430
All right, big guy, we're...

16:17.515 --> 16:19.599
Wait, wait, wait. Where...

16:19.624 --> 16:21.695
Oh, my God, Ian took Mr. Business!

16:21.720 --> 16:24.224
My baby! My baby!

16:26.217 --> 16:28.417
Mr. Business?! Mr. Business?!

16:28.478 --> 16:31.379
- Oh, my God, all you cats look the same
- (meows)

16:31.404 --> 16:32.738
- Sorry.
- Dad!

16:32.824 --> 16:34.240
Louise, someone took Mr. Business.

16:34.325 --> 16:36.075
- What?
- Wait, wh-where's Gayle?

16:36.160 --> 16:37.410
Well, she ran away!

16:37.495 --> 16:39.410
She said she needed to go
into the bathroom and cry,

16:39.435 --> 16:41.080
and I gave her the usual five minutes,

16:41.165 --> 16:42.971
and then I went in
there and she was gone.

16:42.996 --> 16:43.996
Oh, my God.

16:44.021 --> 16:45.785
Ian didn't take the cat, Gayle did.

16:45.810 --> 16:47.222
How we gonna find her?

16:47.247 --> 16:50.787
(woman sobbing loudly in distance)

16:51.009 --> 16:52.508
That could be her.

16:52.593 --> 16:55.394
(woman continues sobbing)

16:55.480 --> 16:58.481
(panting): Oh... oh, geez.

16:58.516 --> 16:59.982
- How many flights was that?
- One.

17:00.018 --> 17:01.233
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:01.319 --> 17:02.518
(groans): Oh...

17:02.603 --> 17:04.569
- Are you gonna die right now?
- Maybe.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.605
GAYLE: No one's hiding up here!

17:06.691 --> 17:09.270
It's just me, the sad janitor

17:09.295 --> 17:12.278
and my janitor cat, Mr. Brooms.

17:12.303 --> 17:15.665
(chuckles): Oh, okay.
Sorry to bother you.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.166
(panting): Okay... one second.

17:18.202 --> 17:20.131
- Hi, Gayle.
- Hi.

17:20.156 --> 17:22.246
Gayle, what are you, what are you doing?

17:22.271 --> 17:23.756
(sniffs) Sitting.

17:23.840 --> 17:27.425
Uh, yes. So, we're gonna miss our
audition time. Did you know that?

17:27.451 --> 17:28.794
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.796
Okay, all right, this
has been fun, but listen.

17:30.882 --> 17:33.549
I need to get my client
down to the audition, stat.

17:33.601 --> 17:35.551
Do you want to talk
about why you're crying?

17:35.636 --> 17:38.824
I just get sad when
Mr. Business gets sad.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.410
Oh, he's sad?

17:40.435 --> 17:41.524
Yes, Bob.

17:41.559 --> 17:43.726
He licked the fur off his belly.

17:43.778 --> 17:45.978
Look at it. You can see his nipples.

17:46.064 --> 17:49.418
Gayle, I know Mr. Business
may be a little stressed out.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.034
"A little stressed out," Bob?

17:52.070 --> 17:54.879
I've never seen his
nipples like this. Never!

17:54.904 --> 17:57.573
The entertainment world
is no place for him.

17:57.625 --> 18:00.793
Oh, okay, so, like, cats
don't want to be famous.

18:00.878 --> 18:02.785
Gayle, this is a real opportunity

18:02.810 --> 18:04.497
for you and Mr. Business.

18:04.582 --> 18:06.192
- Mm-hmm.
- You should take it,

18:06.217 --> 18:09.195
because you borrow a
lot of money from us.

18:09.220 --> 18:10.934
- Like, a lot.
- I do?

18:10.966 --> 18:13.262
Yeah. And that's fine.
It doesn't bother me at all,

18:13.307 --> 18:14.924
but it bothers Linda a little bit.

18:14.976 --> 18:16.819
- Oh.
- But this could be a chance

18:16.844 --> 18:18.844
for you to make a little
money for yourself.

18:18.930 --> 18:21.397
And you could get a
better apartment or...

18:21.432 --> 18:22.659
What's wrong with my apartment?

18:22.683 --> 18:24.160
- Nothing.
- I love it.

18:24.185 --> 18:26.379
Or you could go out
to eat once in a while.

18:26.404 --> 18:27.324
Where?

18:27.349 --> 18:28.414
Point is, Gayle,

18:28.439 --> 18:29.883
you could be a little more independent,

18:29.907 --> 18:32.199
and we could not give you money so much.

18:32.224 --> 18:34.076
So, so much money.

18:34.112 --> 18:38.864
I... I just want Mr.
Business to be happy.

18:38.950 --> 18:42.285
(sighs) I... I guess
I-I see your point.

18:42.310 --> 18:45.121
You care more about your
cat than you do about money,

18:45.173 --> 18:47.123
and that's actually nice.

18:47.208 --> 18:49.792
Even though it's really our
money you don't care about.

18:49.877 --> 18:50.793
Yeah.

18:50.878 --> 18:52.211
Okay, let's go home.

18:52.296 --> 18:54.387
Sure, sure. Just let me borrow the cat

18:54.412 --> 18:56.348
for, like 15 minutes, and
then I'll be right back.

18:56.434 --> 18:58.267
Not for an audition, for something else.

18:58.302 --> 18:59.699
- Okay.
- No.

18:59.724 --> 19:00.636
Fine.

19:00.721 --> 19:03.806
I'll trade you "Cat-ch of the Day"

19:03.891 --> 19:05.641
for "Filet Meow-gnon."

19:05.693 --> 19:07.693
Are you out of your damn mind, Mom?!

19:07.779 --> 19:10.196
(sighs) Let's all just
go take a nap in the sun.

19:10.281 --> 19:11.707
- Yes.
- Hi, guys.

19:11.732 --> 19:14.528
So, uh, some news. Things didn't...

19:14.553 --> 19:18.012
Oh, my God, Lin, you're still
doing this? You told me you quit.

19:18.037 --> 19:18.965
Well, I lied.

19:18.990 --> 19:21.778
Don't judge me. You
watch sports sometimes.

19:21.803 --> 19:24.059
- Yeah.
- Oh, Tina, not you, too.

19:24.084 --> 19:25.317
And me!

19:25.342 --> 19:27.520
Why in the world would
you all eat cat food?

19:27.545 --> 19:30.254
Strong nails, a healthy
shiny coat, confident stools.

19:30.279 --> 19:31.634
You guys are crazy.

19:31.669 --> 19:33.002
Yes, crazy.

19:33.054 --> 19:35.671
You got to warm it up and
put it on your oatmeal.

19:35.723 --> 19:38.507
- Uh-huh. Go on.
- Oh, my God.

19:38.559 --> 19:40.759
Geez, I feel left out. Gimme some, Gene.

19:40.845 --> 19:42.728
Oh, good Lord, you're eating...

19:42.814 --> 19:45.147
Oh, that is so disgusting.

19:45.183 --> 19:47.733
Oh, is it, Ian? Is it so disgusting?

19:47.819 --> 19:49.185
- Yes.
- Oh, God, it is.

19:49.270 --> 19:51.187
Ugh. What is wrong with all of you?

19:51.239 --> 19:52.582
Keep eating, Dad, you'll get it.

19:52.607 --> 19:53.856
No, I won't.

19:53.941 --> 19:55.691
Oh, wait, there it is.

19:55.743 --> 19:58.371
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hmm, that's good.

19:58.396 --> 19:59.945
How'd your cat do in there, Ian?

20:00.031 --> 20:01.606
- She choked.
- Ha!

20:01.631 --> 20:02.758
It's not funny.

20:02.783 --> 20:05.534
She literally choked on the food.
I had to Heimlich her!

20:05.586 --> 20:08.239
Ha! What an idiot. Look at us. Look.

20:08.264 --> 20:10.395
(chews noisily) Swallow.

20:10.420 --> 20:14.543
We can all eat cat food without choking,
so the joke's on you, Ian.

20:14.629 --> 20:17.179
I guess so, Bob. I guess so.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.482
Bye-bye, Bob.

20:18.507 --> 20:19.757
Bye-bye, Ian.

20:21.185 --> 20:22.384
Whoop. All right.

20:22.470 --> 20:23.853
Okay, yep, got it.

20:23.888 --> 20:25.554
Whoop! Caught that one.

20:25.606 --> 20:27.223
Oh, Mr. Business, you are killing me.

20:27.275 --> 20:28.275
Okay, there we go.

20:28.309 --> 20:29.808
Whoa! Oh.

20:29.894 --> 20:31.610
Just a few more years till you die.

20:31.696 --> 20:32.756
- Yeah, that's good. 
- (glass shatters)

20:32.780 --> 20:33.979
Oh, so close.

20:34.065 --> 20:35.564
(glass shatters) 
- No! Oh! Ow!
