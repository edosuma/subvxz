00:01.830 --> 00:03.559
Previously on Elementary...

00:03.600 --> 00:05.522
(grunts)

00:05.570 --> 00:07.697
You work for Sherlock.

00:07.740 --> 00:10.334
I don't work for anyone.
I'm his new partner.

00:10.370 --> 00:11.769
The training I'm attempting
to provide her

00:11.810 --> 00:13.368
is the same training
I provided you.

00:13.410 --> 00:15.537
It is, in part, an attempt
to channel certain

00:15.580 --> 00:18.208
residual feelings that she has
into a productive skill.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.571
You think that Kitty needs help
above and beyond my mentorship.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.680
She's a rape victim.
She was kept and tortured.

00:23.720 --> 00:26.689
I got a nice little surprise.
Stotz is leaving the force.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.187
Glad to hear it all worked out.

00:28.220 --> 00:30.825
What did you say to him?
Does it matter?

00:30.860 --> 00:33.055
I'm folding
my private detective business

00:33.100 --> 00:34.522
and I'm going
to go work for Leda.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.061
An insurance company.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.068
Captain.
A body just turned up--

00:38.100 --> 00:39.067
I need you at the scene.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.237
Her name is Melanie Vilkas.

00:40.270 --> 00:41.760
24 years old.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.802
And the reason I couldn't bring
Kitty with me?

00:43.840 --> 00:46.377
They're the same markings
I saw in those files

00:46.410 --> 00:50.107
you gave me. The same ones
that are on Kitty's back.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.641
The man who hurt her
is here in New York.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.087
(elevator bell dings)

00:59.790 --> 01:01.815
Wow. (chuckles)

01:03.730 --> 01:05.186
Yeah, the view's
not bad, right?

01:05.230 --> 01:06.697
Not bad, no.

01:06.730 --> 01:08.698
But, please, make
yourself at home.

01:08.730 --> 01:10.721
We want you to be
as comfortable here at Leda

01:10.770 --> 01:12.192
as you were at your old job.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.389
(phone buzzes)

01:13.440 --> 01:14.862
I'll try, but how do you guys

01:14.900 --> 01:16.765
feel about pj's at the office?

01:16.810 --> 01:19.870
Well, there's been talk
of expanding casual Fridays.

01:19.910 --> 01:22.572
Oh, Del, I cannot

01:22.610 --> 01:23.872
thank you enough
for this opportunity.

01:23.910 --> 01:26.640
Or this office--
it's incredible.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.819
Well, it comes
with a big job.

01:28.850 --> 01:30.841
I-I don't want to scare you, but

01:30.890 --> 01:32.551
_ our_ in-house_
Investigation unit's

01:32.590 --> 01:34.182
got a little
complacent.

01:34.220 --> 01:35.858
But I have a feeling
you're gonna give 'em

01:35.890 --> 01:37.221
a great shot in the arm.

01:37.260 --> 01:39.228
Well, I can't wait
to get started.

01:39.260 --> 01:40.852
(phone rings)

01:40.900 --> 01:42.868
Well, at least
we know the tech people

01:42.900 --> 01:44.390
got your company
phone activated.

01:44.430 --> 01:45.863
Actually, it's Sherlock.
We talked about him

01:45.900 --> 01:47.333
during the interview process.

01:47.370 --> 01:48.837
The ex-partner.
(phone rings)

01:48.870 --> 01:51.236
Sorry, if I don't tell him
to stop, he probably won't.

01:51.270 --> 01:54.137
Um, Sherlock, now
is not a great time to t...

01:54.180 --> 01:56.171
(door unlocks)

02:00.780 --> 02:02.816
Watson.

02:02.850 --> 02:05.239
I thought today was the day.
To start work.

02:05.290 --> 02:06.689
HOLMES:
I asked her to be here.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.654
For you.

02:08.690 --> 02:10.157
The man who took you in London.

02:10.190 --> 02:12.499
He's come here. To New York.

02:15.230 --> 02:17.198
How do you...

02:17.230 --> 02:19.630
How do you know?

02:19.670 --> 02:22.468
Early this morning, the body
of a woman named Melanie Vilkas

02:22.510 --> 02:24.933
was found on a pier in
Gantry Plaza. She had been

02:24.970 --> 02:26.835
blindfolded with duct tape.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.700
The flesh on her back
was branded.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.605
Every aspect
of the attack on you

02:30.650 --> 02:33.175
had been replicated identically.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.211
It's him.

02:37.250 --> 02:39.252
He is serial after all.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.828
How did it end?

02:43.860 --> 02:47.193
Blunt force trauma.
She died from internal injuries.

02:48.860 --> 02:50.896
He's never left a body before.

02:50.930 --> 02:53.194
That you and I were
able to discern, no.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.731
We assumed that, in the event
his crimes were recurrent,

02:55.770 --> 02:58.364
he took great care
to dispose of his victims.

02:58.410 --> 03:01.277
But it seems in this case,
the body was meant to be found.

03:01.310 --> 03:03.471
Sherlock and I
have been talking.

03:03.510 --> 03:04.909
_ We do_n't_think
It's a connCIdence.

03:04.950 --> 03:07.874
You think he's found me?

03:07.920 --> 03:11.310
If he has, he's made
a grave mistake. Watson

03:11.350 --> 03:13.409
and_I intend to
capitalize on it.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.815
You and Watson?
I know you've always
seen yourself

03:15.860 --> 03:18.385
in pursuit, but that's
turned around now.

03:18.430 --> 03:20.398
He clearly has plans for you.

03:20.430 --> 03:22.398
He has
announced himself.

03:22.430 --> 03:24.421
Captain Gregson's already
assigned plainclothes details

03:24.470 --> 03:27.268
to the brownstone,
but you don't have to stay.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.268
Obviously,
the decision is yours,

03:29.310 --> 03:32.279
but I am of the opinion
you should not.

03:32.310 --> 03:35.006
We have any number of safe
houses at our disposal.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.644
Alternatively, you could
return to London

03:36.680 --> 03:38.648
and stay at Baker Street
or with your family.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.615
I'm not going anywhere. This
is why I became a detective--

03:41.650 --> 03:43.481
to hunt this man.
I'm ready.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.216
Clearly, he feels prepared
for the encounter as well.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.824
When you and I looked for him
in London, there was nothing.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.652
The trail was cold,
and it's not cold anymore.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.930
There's nothing I wouldn't
give to find him.

03:59.970 --> 04:02.029
Nothing.

04:02.070 --> 04:04.265
GREGSON:
A woman

04:04.310 --> 04:06.301
goes missing three days ago, and

04:06.340 --> 04:08.274
you've got one page of notes?

04:08.310 --> 04:10.278
Is that how you guys
do it at the 8th,

04:10.310 --> 04:12.312
Whitaker?

04:12.350 --> 04:14.045
Melanie Vilkas'
parents come in.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.947
The first thing they tell me
is how much they hate

04:16.990 --> 04:18.548
their daughter's fianc.

04:18.590 --> 04:20.956
This kid, Brandon Powell.

04:20.990 --> 04:22.526
All right? She's been
with him since high school.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.050
Mom and Dad wanted her
to take a little time,

04:24.090 --> 04:25.921
see what else
was out there.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.723
She doesn't return a couple
of phone calls one day--

04:27.760 --> 04:29.057
boom, they're
down at the station

04:29.100 --> 04:29.998
filling out
a missing person's report

04:30.030 --> 04:31.395
and pointing
the finger.

04:31.430 --> 04:33.398
To be honest, I thought she was

04:33.440 --> 04:35.294
taking a break from them.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.001
Did you talk to the fianc?
I got

04:37.040 --> 04:39.304
why Dad wasn't a fan.

04:39.340 --> 04:42.377
But I never read
"creep" from the guy.

04:42.410 --> 04:44.640
Obviously, I got it wrong.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.671
You think
the fianc did this.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.048
She was left with
all her jewelry, right?

04:50.090 --> 04:51.546
Mm-mm.

04:51.590 --> 04:54.457
Her engagement ring
was missing. How do I know?

04:54.490 --> 04:56.458
Dad complained
about that, too.

04:56.490 --> 04:59.027
It was the fianc's
grandmother's.

04:59.060 --> 05:02.359
A family heirloom.
Only there wasn't a diamond.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.324
It was an emerald instead.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.000
Mom and Dad must've finally
gotten through to her.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.531
She told Powell it was over,

05:13.580 --> 05:15.969
he killed her,
took his ring back.

05:16.010 --> 05:17.500
Respectfully,
Detective,

05:17.550 --> 05:19.643
your indolence is not excused
by the existence

05:19.680 --> 05:22.046
of a prospect force-fed
by the victim's family.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.389
You said they're consultants?

05:24.420 --> 05:25.682
They're the
investigators

05:25.720 --> 05:28.018
who are gonna be
cleaning up after you.

05:28.060 --> 05:29.925
We're taking
over here.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.399
The fianc doesn't even have
a passport. He's innocent.

05:36.430 --> 05:38.728
You know, not that it's
any of my business now,

05:38.770 --> 05:40.032
but what the hell's
the difference

05:40.070 --> 05:42.095
the kid doesn't have a passport?

05:42.140 --> 05:45.439
Because I got these in London.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.414
The man who did it
had me locked in a room

05:53.450 --> 05:55.873
for three days
before I got away.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.888
That's who we're looking for.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.980
That's who you spent the last
three days not looking for.

06:03.490 --> 06:04.957
Trust me when I say it...

06:04.990 --> 06:07.493
felt much longer to her.

06:07.530 --> 06:09.020
(breathing heavily)

06:09.060 --> 06:10.061
Aah!
(coughs)

06:10.100 --> 06:12.660
Quiet now.

06:14.170 --> 06:16.809
I promise you it will get worse.

06:21.540 --> 06:23.542
(crying)

06:39.830 --> 06:41.923
Look at the hair color,
the bone structure.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.190
Tell me you don't
see a resemblance?

06:44.230 --> 06:47.028
So the killer had a type.

06:47.070 --> 06:49.868
Or perhaps he's just stuck
on the one that got away.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.470
All that he's done here--
from his choice of victim

06:52.510 --> 06:55.809
to her placement-- signals an
intent to make this personal.

06:55.840 --> 06:59.617
You must resist the urge
to follow his lead.

07:01.980 --> 07:05.939
Most of the facts that we have
are from my case in London.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.515
That detective from the other
precinct hadn't got much further

07:08.560 --> 07:10.687
than how to spell
Melanie Vilkas' name.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.152
We have all manner of data
from the victim's

07:12.190 --> 07:14.158
cell phone,
thanks to her provider.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.849
They're a thousand Dutch
angle landscapes and texts

07:15.900 --> 07:17.197
with her roommate--
they're hardly

07:17.230 --> 07:18.993
a treasure trove.
I disagree.

07:19.030 --> 07:20.861
The camera roll indicates

07:20.900 --> 07:23.505
that this photograph
was taken just ten days ago.

07:23.540 --> 07:26.532
So we have a recent photo. This
is not a missing person's case.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.832
It's her only self-portrait.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.871
Taken one week
before she disappeared.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.946
Given the narcissism that
consumes the modern epoch,

07:34.980 --> 07:37.517
a solitary selfie
is a minor miracle.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.689
Melanie Vilkas

07:39.720 --> 07:40.880
was a modest beauty.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.184
So why, then, did
she suddenly decide

07:43.230 --> 07:45.926
to turn her much-used
camera on herself?

07:45.960 --> 07:47.689
Perhaps
she decided

07:47.730 --> 07:49.891
to finally heed
her parents' advice.

07:49.930 --> 07:52.125
What if, before
rushing into marriage,

07:52.170 --> 07:54.195
she planned to see
if there were indeed...

07:54.240 --> 07:56.708
other fish in the sea?

07:56.740 --> 07:58.207
You think she needed
a profile picture

07:58.240 --> 08:00.174
for a dating Web site.

08:00.210 --> 08:03.270
Well, that's an easy enough
theory to test.

08:03.310 --> 08:04.971
Dating sites are as searchable
as databases get.

08:05.010 --> 08:06.272
They are also

08:06.310 --> 08:10.144
v_irtua| menus for men
like the one we seek.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.078
I'm sorry she's dead, okay?

08:12.120 --> 08:14.111
But I never even met this girl.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.981
If you're gonna
sit there and lie to us, Ron,

08:17.030 --> 08:19.658
we're gonna have
a rough time here.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.952
Your brief courtship
of Melanie Vilkas

08:22.000 --> 08:25.094
on LoveMatchSet.com
is well documented.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.995
You came on
strong,

08:27.040 --> 08:29.099
like Flaubert
with an emoji addiction.

08:29.140 --> 08:31.938
That was just...
It was all online.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.699
Yeah, we can read.

08:33.740 --> 08:35.708
You two agreed to meet up
at Park Slope

08:35.740 --> 08:39.073
at Mobius Tavern
on Monday night.

08:39.110 --> 08:40.941
You want to guess
when she went missing?

08:40.980 --> 08:42.242
Our colleague left
a short while ago

08:42.280 --> 08:43.941
to show your
photograph

08:43.990 --> 08:45.844
around the bar.

08:45.890 --> 08:47.619
There was an ample
selection of snapshots

08:47.660 --> 08:49.821
to choose from
on your profile. We opted

08:49.860 --> 08:52.021
against Windsurfing Ron
and went with Ron

08:52.060 --> 08:53.857
in Front of Big Ben instead.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.698
Would you mind telling me what
year that photograph was taken?

08:56.730 --> 08:57.958
What? That was...

08:58.000 --> 09:00.036
What do you think?
That was a while ago,

09:00.070 --> 09:02.561
it's been like...
Even if this were
five years ago,

09:02.610 --> 09:04.965
it'd be difficult for me
to make a positive I.D..

09:05.010 --> 09:06.773
RON: Why?
GREGSON: Because
it just so happens...

09:06.810 --> 09:09.074
But you know that. You were
given my files this morning.

09:09.110 --> 09:11.647
GREGSON:
He was there five years ago...

09:11.680 --> 09:15.343
You were in a club. Someone
slipped something in your drink.

09:15.380 --> 09:18.019
I woke up

09:18.050 --> 09:21.156
and there was tape over my eyes,
around my wrists.

09:21.190 --> 09:23.181
I never actually saw.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.669
He sounded American.
That much I do remember.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.760
As far as details
that might actually help.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.768
Hey.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.768
You survived.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.960
You got away.

09:39.010 --> 09:42.070
What do you think
when you see a girl like her?

09:43.080 --> 09:44.809
I didn't do this.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.216
Then I guess no one at
Mobius Tavern is gonna remember

09:47.250 --> 09:49.616
seeing you the night
Melanie disappeared?

09:49.650 --> 09:52.858
They might remember my face.
That I was there that night.

09:52.890 --> 09:54.118
But I wasn't with her.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.048
Explain.
When I walked in,

09:56.090 --> 09:59.218
I saw her
from across the room...

09:59.260 --> 10:02.969
She wasn't as hot as she was
in her picture, okay?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.399
So I left.

10:04.430 --> 10:05.988
She never even saw me.

10:06.030 --> 10:07.167
I swear.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.394
You're saying you stood her up.

10:08.440 --> 10:11.136
I wish I hadn't.

10:11.170 --> 10:12.671
Maybe none of this
would have happened,

10:12.710 --> 10:14.075
but that is all I did wrong.

10:14.110 --> 10:16.169
Can you account for your
whereabouts after you left?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.338
I met up with
some guys from work.

10:19.380 --> 10:22.247
We were out at a club
till, like, 2:00, 2:30.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.987
I'll give you their numbers.

10:25.020 --> 10:28.012
They'll tell you I'm not
the guy you're looking for.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.055
I don't know. Maybe.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.058
I mean, we
were slammed.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.091
We got music on Mondays,
so this place was packed.

10:36.130 --> 10:38.269
What about this girl?

10:38.300 --> 10:40.165
Do you remember her?

10:42.300 --> 10:45.701
Gin martini up,
two olives. Yeah.

10:45.740 --> 10:48.208
She was at the corner table
while the band set up.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.707
Was she with anyone?

10:49.750 --> 10:52.002
No, it seemed like
she was waiting for somebody.

10:52.050 --> 10:54.245
She nursed that drink
for, like, an hour.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.748
Didn't help, though.
She couldn't handle her liquor.

10:56.790 --> 10:57.814
What do you mean?

10:57.850 --> 10:59.181
I remember she tried to get up

10:59.220 --> 11:00.858
to go to the ladies',
she could barely walk.

11:00.890 --> 11:03.029
That sounds more
like she was roofied.

11:03.060 --> 11:04.186
I don't know.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.425
Our clientele's pretty upscale.

11:06.460 --> 11:09.054
Right. Because rape is
only committed by poor people.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.397
Rape?
That woman you saw,

11:10.430 --> 11:12.193
Melanie Vilkas,
she disappeared that night.

11:12.230 --> 11:14.232
Her body was found
earlier this morning.

11:14.270 --> 11:17.159
And you think somebody here...
We're still
putting together

11:17.210 --> 11:19.405
a time line-- it would help
to look at security footage.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.998
But I don't see
any cameras anywhere.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.769
Our owner wanted
a celebrity clientele.

11:22.810 --> 11:25.779
Somebody told him
not to put them in.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.118
Then I'd like to see
your receipts for Monday night.

11:27.150 --> 11:29.015
It'll help us figure out
who was here.

11:29.050 --> 11:30.779
Yeah, you can have
whatever we got.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.139
Including...

11:32.190 --> 11:33.953
Hold on.

11:34.990 --> 11:36.958
There was a phone.

11:36.990 --> 11:39.288
One of the servers found it
under that table

11:39.330 --> 11:40.957
at the end of the night.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.820
We figured it might be hers.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.964
Don't. Don't touch it.
It's not hers.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.037
It's a disposable,
but it might be his.

11:49.070 --> 11:51.300
(footsteps approaching)

11:55.010 --> 11:56.329
Anything?

11:56.380 --> 11:58.848
Appletinis are
making a comeback.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.346
I have run nearly 50 names
of the tavern's male patrons

12:03.390 --> 12:05.210
and come back
with exactly zero hits,

12:05.250 --> 12:06.911
not even
a parking ticket.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.110
The chance that your
abductor paid with his Amex

12:09.160 --> 12:11.378
at the scene _of his latest
crime are Virtually nil,

12:11.430 --> 12:13.057
but there is an_
applicable expre55ion

12:13.100 --> 12:16.228
about leaving no
stone left unturned.

12:16.260 --> 12:20.230
One drink-- just like
the bartender told Watson.

12:20.270 --> 12:21.760
She texted, by the way.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.939
She said it all
went well at Leda

12:23.970 --> 12:25.267
and she will rejoin us shortly.

12:25.310 --> 12:27.301
She's being stupid.
Today was supposed to be

12:27.340 --> 12:29.501
her first day-- now she's
taking a leave of absence.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.269
She cares about your case.

12:31.310 --> 12:33.073
As do I.

12:36.380 --> 12:39.543
Perhaps we should...
go to a meeting.

12:39.590 --> 12:41.057
Mine or yours?

12:41.090 --> 12:42.955
Yours.

12:42.990 --> 12:44.252
That's a fine idea.

12:44.290 --> 12:46.326
Not like there's
a homicidal rapist about.

12:46.360 --> 12:49.056
Perhaps we could take in
a show, too.
This work

12:49.100 --> 12:50.897
is easily handed off
to the department.

12:50.930 --> 12:52.898
We have the phone
that Watson found.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.261
There's no reason _
they can't also study receipts.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.235
I am concerned about you.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.334
(phone ringing)

13:04.210 --> 13:05.370
Detective.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.071
BELL:
Check your e-mail.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.247
The burner Joan found
at the bar was fresh.

13:09.280 --> 13:12.010
Only had a few calls on it,
all to other disposables,

13:12.050 --> 13:13.381
but we got good prints.

13:13.420 --> 13:16.218
They belong
to a pretty nasty ex-con.

13:17.860 --> 13:20.499
HOLMES:
Simon de Merville.
Lengthy record.

13:20.530 --> 13:23.294
Solicitation and coke, mostly.
Spent some time in Otisville.

13:23.330 --> 13:26.265
We're reaching out
to known associates right now.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.495
Any luck,
we'll turn up an address.

13:28.540 --> 13:31.304
Keep us posted.

13:33.410 --> 13:35.207
(pounding on door)

13:35.240 --> 13:37.549
(pounding on door continues)

13:42.150 --> 13:43.082
(gasps)

13:46.050 --> 13:48.018
It's all right, ma'am.
You're gonna be all right.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.028
Clear!
This is Team Four.

13:50.060 --> 13:52.585
We are clear upstairs,
but we got another one.

13:52.630 --> 13:54.359
(trembling breath)

13:54.400 --> 13:55.822
Clear.

13:56.900 --> 13:58.891
(indistinct radio transmission)

14:03.540 --> 14:06.168
(siren wailing in distance)

14:09.010 --> 14:12.343
Just... take them away.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.355
(quietly):
Son of a bitch.

14:31.370 --> 14:35.158
Team Leader to Detective Bell,
meet me on channel four.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.202
Copy that...

14:38.410 --> 14:40.401
It's him.

14:40.440 --> 14:43.307
I'm holding the brand he used
on Melanie Vilkas...

14:43.350 --> 14:45.204
and Kitty.

14:45.250 --> 14:48.310
I got to say, this
is not what I was expecting.

14:48.350 --> 14:49.908
His old dealer told us

14:49.950 --> 14:52.316
he was running a brothel
for the Albanians.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.682
No, I know, it's just...
this guy turns out girls

14:54.720 --> 14:56.551
for work and fun?

14:56.590 --> 14:59.184
Wouldn't be the first twist
with a day job.

14:59.230 --> 15:01.391
_I'm more interested
in why he isn't here.
Detective Bell.

15:01.430 --> 15:02.624
His car's out front.

15:02.660 --> 15:05.458
One of the girls told us
he left an hour ago.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.060
So, did one of the contacts
we talked to

15:08.100 --> 15:11.103
tip him off,
or did he just get luclq?

15:12.470 --> 15:15.234
MAN: I think we got
two more upstairs.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.498
I don't think he got luclq.

15:17.550 --> 15:20.474
I think he was fleeing
the scene of a murder.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.451
(knocking)

15:27.490 --> 15:30.948
Sonia, the nurses said
you asked to speak to someone.

15:30.990 --> 15:33.299
Yeah. You're police?

15:33.330 --> 15:34.592
We work with the police.

15:34.630 --> 15:37.599
Have you talked
to the others?

15:37.630 --> 15:40.269
No. They're still being treated.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.632
SONIA: I want to know
what is being done.

15:42.670 --> 15:45.468
What about the man who
did this to me? Simon.

15:45.510 --> 15:48.138
We're looking for him.
We're still trying to make sense

15:48.180 --> 15:49.499
of what happened at the house.

15:49.540 --> 15:51.201
What do you mean?

15:51.250 --> 15:53.275
This was not our choice.
We did not want...

15:53.320 --> 15:54.469
We know.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.318
I meant, what Simon did
and where he went.

15:59.790 --> 16:03.521
(clears throat) Well, what, uh,
happened at the house is, uh...

16:03.560 --> 16:06.085
Simon, he gave orders,

16:06.130 --> 16:08.394
he watched us, and...

16:08.430 --> 16:11.763
and the other man--
he brought the girls to America.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.394
He brought me here from Croatia.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.238
His name is...
KIl _| Y:
ErVIn.

16:17.270 --> 16:19.568
At least it was.
Ervin Bogdani.

16:19.610 --> 16:21.498
He's a suspected
sex trafficker.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.747
He had ties with
the Albanian mafia.

16:23.780 --> 16:25.543
Had?
WATSON:
We found his body

16:25.580 --> 16:28.276
at the house--
we think Simon killed him.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.148
Good.

16:33.590 --> 16:35.581
That's good.

16:35.620 --> 16:38.783
You said that Simon
ran the house.

16:38.830 --> 16:42.288
He said I was the most trouble.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.560
There was this one man, he...

16:44.600 --> 16:47.137
he came back
and asked for me a few times.

16:47.170 --> 16:50.435
I thought he liked me, so...

16:50.470 --> 16:54.304
I asked him to call the police.

16:54.340 --> 16:56.535
Is that why you
were locked in that room?

16:56.580 --> 17:01.449
Simon said he was,
uh, going to teach me...

17:01.480 --> 17:03.641
again, like when it started.

17:05.420 --> 17:08.184
They, uh...

17:08.220 --> 17:11.485
they hit you and rape you.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.397
And they make you
take the drugs

17:14.430 --> 17:17.160
until you will,
uh, meet the men.
(clears throat)

17:17.200 --> 17:19.464
Then they move you
here and there.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.196
And in the end, most girls
don't fight anymore.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.605
You know, it's your life.

17:26.370 --> 17:29.533
I didn't want it anymore.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.379
Sonia,

17:33.420 --> 17:35.411
this woman's name is Melanie.

17:35.450 --> 17:37.589
Did you ever see her
at the house?

17:38.620 --> 17:40.281
No, but they...

17:40.320 --> 17:42.459
they tried to keep us
to ourselves

17:42.490 --> 17:45.459
so we wouldn't help each other.

17:45.490 --> 17:48.596
And sometimes new girls
would come in, and...

17:48.630 --> 17:51.463
then they're gone--
they're sold to others for work

17:51.500 --> 17:53.559
(crying):
or to one man who...

17:53.600 --> 17:56.660
wants one girl
for themself. (sobs)

17:58.570 --> 18:00.606
(sniffles)
It's okay.
It's over.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.403
You're safe now.

18:02.440 --> 18:06.274
(takes deep breath)
Yeah.

18:06.310 --> 18:07.846
You should rest, okay?

18:07.880 --> 18:10.519
(exhales, sniffles)

18:19.730 --> 18:21.618
(sighs)

18:21.660 --> 18:23.696
Are you okay?

18:23.730 --> 18:27.689
I've always had an understanding
of what happened to me.

18:29.400 --> 18:32.699
The man who took me
was a predator.

18:32.740 --> 18:35.436
I was his prey;
it was simple.

18:38.280 --> 18:41.841
I had no doubt in my mind
that in the end...

18:41.880 --> 18:44.587
I was gonna be...

18:48.520 --> 18:52.559
But what if_ I was meant
to end up like her, just...

18:52.590 --> 18:55.320
property,
a plaything?

18:55.360 --> 18:57.362
I went through
three days of hell.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.392
She's been... she's been living
with it for years.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.204
IfI hadn't managed
to get away from him...

19:07.780 --> 19:10.908
There are differences
between...

19:10.950 --> 19:13.441
you and Melanie and the others.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.914
They were at-risk women
from Eastern Europe,

19:15.950 --> 19:18.248
lured into
prostitution,

19:18.290 --> 19:20.884
promised jobs and
taken across borders.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.956
You and Melanie were
drugged at bars,

19:22.990 --> 19:24.651
blindfolded and branded.

19:24.690 --> 19:26.726
Sonia doesn't have
scars like yours.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.497
Neither do any of
the other women.

19:30.530 --> 19:33.260
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

19:33.300 --> 19:35.791
I wasn't gonna be sold
into sex slavery.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.606
I was going to be beaten
to death and left on a pier.
I'm just trying

19:39.640 --> 19:42.768
to understand who
this man is, why he's
doing what he's doing.

19:42.810 --> 19:45.779
It's like she said,
he's a monster--
they don't need a why.

19:45.810 --> 19:46.799
(phone rings)

19:48.780 --> 19:50.316
(sighs)

19:50.350 --> 19:51.942
We're just
wrapping up here.

19:51.990 --> 19:54.788
Our manhunt for Simon
de Merville is about to graduate

19:54.820 --> 19:56.788
from APBs and news reports
to a proper search.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.788
The car that he stole
has been found.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.457
He stole a car?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.650
While examining
the crime scene,

20:02.700 --> 20:04.691
the circumstances of Ervin
Bogdani's death became clear.

20:04.730 --> 20:06.698
He came at De Merville
with a knife.

20:06.730 --> 20:08.334
De Merville overpowered him

20:08.370 --> 20:10.406
but not before being stabbed
in his left arm.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.931
I traced the blood trail
to a house down the street.

20:12.970 --> 20:14.938
There was broken auto glass
at the curb.

20:14.980 --> 20:18.347
The DMV was consulted,
and a LoJack put to good use.

20:18.380 --> 20:19.938
We now know
that Simon de Merville

20:19.980 --> 20:21.811
left a purloined Hyundai Sonata

20:21.850 --> 20:24.717
at the corner
of 40th and 8th Avenue.

20:24.750 --> 20:25.887
That's right near
Port Authority.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.650
You think he took
a bus out of town?

20:28.690 --> 20:30.555
I do not.
I think he was headed

20:30.590 --> 20:32.729
to Immaculate Heart Hospital
in the same neighborhood.

20:32.760 --> 20:35.752
If he needed to be stitched up,
he had his pick of hospitals.

20:35.800 --> 20:36.459
We're standing in one.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.320
You might recall from his file

20:38.370 --> 20:39.667
that he has a sister, Violet.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.964
The police could not reach her
this morning,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.901
but she works at the pharmacy
at Immaculate Heart.

20:44.940 --> 20:47.500
The evidence suggests
that De Merville

20:47.540 --> 20:49.531
is out of favor
with his Albanian employers.

20:49.580 --> 20:51.901
Perhaps they found out about
his extracurricular activities

20:51.950 --> 20:53.747
and disapproved.
In any event,

20:53.780 --> 20:57.011
turning to one of his cronies
in his hour of need

20:57.050 --> 20:58.688
would be rislq.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.415
So he's turning
to family instead.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.052
The police are searching
the hospital as we speak,

21:02.090 --> 21:04.422
if you and Kitty
would like to join us.

21:04.460 --> 21:05.825
WOMAN:
I'm sorry you were

21:05.860 --> 21:07.725
too late to talk to Simon,
but it's like

21:07.760 --> 21:10.297
I told the other eight cops--
I don't know anything.

21:10.330 --> 21:11.922
Well, you might know more
than you realize.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.291
Let us be the judge.
We're just...

21:14.340 --> 21:15.693
We're not close.

21:15.740 --> 21:16.934
I hadn't seen him
for, like, a year,

21:16.970 --> 21:18.369
and then he shows up
out of nowhere.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.934
He was bloody, he was a mess.

21:19.970 --> 21:21.801
He came to you
for medical help.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.001
He said he was in a bar fight,
and he just didn't want

21:24.050 --> 21:26.803
to answer a lot of questions
from the cops.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.943
I couldn't just
turn him away.

21:28.980 --> 21:31.312
The cut wasn't bad.
It-it was deep,

21:31.350 --> 21:33.318
but it didn't hit anything.
So I taped him up

21:33.360 --> 21:35.783
and I told him to get out.
That's it.

21:35.820 --> 21:37.856
He say where he was going?

21:37.890 --> 21:40.358
VIOLET:
He didn't
say anything.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.095
BELL:
And you
didn't ask.

21:42.130 --> 21:44.098
KI'I'I'Y:_
You're qUIte
pretty, you know.

21:44.130 --> 21:46.360
You should see what Simon
does to pretty girls,

21:46.400 --> 21:48.459
what his clients do.
VIOLET:
I don't know what you're....

21:48.500 --> 21:50.968
KITTY:
You helped a murderer
today, a rapist.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.807
You're wrong.
And until you find out

21:52.840 --> 21:55.331
what's really happening here,
I hope you don't find him.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.871
This is a mistake.

21:57.910 --> 21:59.878
You may well be right.
I certainly hope so.

21:59.910 --> 22:02.378
In any event,
you've done all you can,

22:02.420 --> 22:04.081
and, uh, we thank
you for your time.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.023
She's lying.

22:12.060 --> 22:14.426
Yes. Well aware. Thank you.

22:14.460 --> 22:16.428
She absolutely knows
what her brother does

22:16.460 --> 22:18.428
for a living, yet she agreed
to help him anyway.

22:18.470 --> 22:20.938
Her soul is a horror. Doesn't
mean she should be arrested.

22:20.970 --> 22:22.767
If we take her

22:22.800 --> 22:23.960
into custody
for aiding and abetting,

22:24.010 --> 22:25.932
that would significantly
decrease the chances

22:25.970 --> 22:27.676
of her leading us
to her brother.

22:27.710 --> 22:28.904
Isn't that right, Detective?

22:28.940 --> 22:30.908
I'll call the captain,
see about a tail

22:30.950 --> 22:33.976
and electronic surveillance
for Ms. De MerVIIIe.

22:37.950 --> 22:40.919
And what is it
you did not want Marcus to know?

22:40.960 --> 22:43.155
De Merville didn't come
here for a Band-Aid.

22:43.190 --> 22:46.626
He came here for Esephera.

22:46.660 --> 22:48.958
May I remind you that we
didn't both used to be doctors?

22:49.000 --> 22:50.968
It's a blood medication.
Making it all
the more appropriate

22:51.000 --> 22:52.797
that his _own blood
gave him away.

22:52.830 --> 22:53.933
He left a trace of blood

22:53.970 --> 22:55.062
on the inside of the glass door

22:55.100 --> 22:56.499
of a locked refrigerator.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.462
Only one drug is missing.

22:58.510 --> 23:01.638
He could have robbed the
pharmacy of OxyContin, Vicodin,

23:01.680 --> 23:04.171
any number of narcotics which
could be converted into cash.

23:04.210 --> 23:06.701
Indeed, he could have robbed
them of actual cash.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.911
So then why take...?
Esephera.

23:08.950 --> 23:10.508
It's a treatment for PNH.

23:10.550 --> 23:12.984
There are fewer than
a thousand cases in the US.

23:13.020 --> 23:15.181
Tiny blood clots form in
the arteries if you don't take

23:15.220 --> 23:17.688
the medication.
A year's supply
runs north

23:17.730 --> 23:19.880
of half a million dollars,
but I doubt the pharmacy

23:19.930 --> 23:21.852
kept more than a month or two
on hand.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.027
Simon didn't take any medication
when he was in prison.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.799
He does not have PNH.

23:25.830 --> 23:27.969
One possibility is
that he knows someone who does.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.036
Another possibility,
far more likely,

23:30.070 --> 23:32.459
is that his sister pointed him
in the direction

23:32.510 --> 23:35.479
of another sufferer who is also
a customer of the pharmacy.

23:35.510 --> 23:38.445
That person might be willing
to buy it at a discount.
Or...

23:38.480 --> 23:40.004
even provide De Merville
with safe haven

23:40.050 --> 23:41.813
until the Albanians
and the police call off

23:41.850 --> 23:43.715
their respective dogs.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.547
There's just one problem:
the department can't access

23:45.590 --> 23:47.956
pharmacy medical records.
Patient privacy rights

23:47.990 --> 23:49.912
make it impossible
to get a warrant.
Yeah,

23:49.960 --> 23:52.781
for a police detective
this would be no lead at all.

23:52.830 --> 23:55.025
But for an investigator
in the employ

23:55.060 --> 23:58.223
of a global insurance company,
however...

23:58.270 --> 23:59.828
DEL:
You realize
what you're looking for.

23:59.870 --> 24:02.236
The Insurance Records Bureau
may not even have it.

24:02.270 --> 24:04.909
The IRB has medical data
on everyone who's applied for

24:04.940 --> 24:06.134
orchanged
their health insurance

24:06.170 --> 24:07.728
in the last seven years.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.975
200 million Americans, right?

24:10.010 --> 24:13.002
Anyone with PNH is staring
down the barrel of a $500,000

24:13.050 --> 24:15.018
prescription bill every year.

24:15.050 --> 24:17.587
Most of them will have shopped
around for the best insurance.

24:17.620 --> 24:20.009
So whoever Simon de Merville
gave his Esephera to--

24:20.050 --> 24:21.813
that person should be
in the system.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.828
Well, I'm glad you're so sure.
'Cause I thought

24:23.860 --> 24:26.488
you were asking me to defraud
a powerful institution

24:26.530 --> 24:28.725
and commit a felony
for a shot in the dark.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.524
(sighs)
I understand. It's a lot.

24:31.570 --> 24:34.767
(scoffs)
You know, even if I wanted to,

24:34.800 --> 24:37.189
I don't know how to request
a list of patients

24:37.240 --> 24:40.004
who have a certain disease.
That's not what the IRB database

24:40.040 --> 24:42.201
is for. You know, we give
them the name of someone

24:42.240 --> 24:44.549
who's applying for life
insurance, they kick out

24:44.580 --> 24:45.945
a coded list
of their medical history

24:45.980 --> 24:47.174
to help us arrive at a premium.

24:47.210 --> 24:49.075
This is...
Irregular.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.747
No question.
But at the end of the day,

24:50.790 --> 24:53.554
the IRB answers
to its subscribers. Like Leda.

24:53.590 --> 24:55.558
They don't just do
whatever we ask.

24:55.590 --> 24:57.057
You can tell them
that Leda is researching

24:57.090 --> 24:59.058
new actuarial models,

24:59.090 --> 25:01.888
disguise what we're after by
making a bigger request for data

25:01.930 --> 25:04.967
on all blood disorders. All
we need is a list of patients

25:05.000 --> 25:07.298
in the New York area
who are coded for PNH.

25:07.330 --> 25:10.800
You've really thought this out.

25:10.840 --> 25:13.001
I would not be asking for this

25:13.040 --> 25:15.907
if it wasn't for someone
I con5ider family.

25:19.050 --> 25:20.642
(meowing)
Come on, Pickles.

25:20.680 --> 25:21.908
(knocking)

25:26.120 --> 25:27.849
Hello again.

25:29.020 --> 25:32.080
Did you find him?
Did you find Simon?

25:32.130 --> 25:33.324
No.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.328
I came here to apologize.

25:35.360 --> 25:39.990
For the things I said,
losing my temper.

25:40.030 --> 25:43.705
I can only imagine how difficult
things have been for you.

25:43.740 --> 25:46.163
If you're amenable,

25:46.210 --> 25:49.008
I'd like to ask you
a few more questions.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.804
I already told you...
Please?

25:51.850 --> 25:55.047
It'll only take a moment.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.341
(sighs)

25:59.390 --> 26:01.950
I'll give you
five minutes.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.294
What are you doing?

26:09.330 --> 26:11.719
There's an unmarked police car

26:11.770 --> 26:13.089
parked in front
of your building.

26:14.300 --> 26:17.030
I'd rather they not catch
a glimpse of me

26:17.070 --> 26:19.061
through your windows.

26:19.110 --> 26:22.170
I don't understand.
Don't you work with them?

26:25.310 --> 26:28.017
Not tonight.

26:32.690 --> 26:34.851
(bees buzzing)

26:48.940 --> 26:51.261
You startled me.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.164
I tried you three times.
I thought something happened.

26:53.210 --> 26:54.802
I would've called the police
if they weren't already guarding

26:54.840 --> 26:55.807
your front door.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.774
I was immersing myself.

26:57.810 --> 26:59.801
Well, I couldn't get Kitty
either.

26:59.850 --> 27:01.977
She was working at the
station. She texted me

27:02.020 --> 27:04.318
to say she was en route
to a meeting. Alone.

27:04.350 --> 27:06.147
I was not consulted
on her deCI5ion

27:06.190 --> 27:08.055
to venture out unchaperoned.

27:08.090 --> 27:10.058
Well, maybe she didn't want
to come home and see all this.

27:10.090 --> 27:11.978
Can you imagine how she feels
when she looks at it?

27:12.030 --> 27:15.193
I have done. Repeatedly.
My name is Sherlock,

27:15.230 --> 27:17.869
and I have allowed empathetic
thoughts to clutter my mind

27:17.900 --> 27:20.221
and reduce the clarity
of my perception.

27:20.270 --> 27:21.237
So you called in the bees

27:21.270 --> 27:22.794
to crowd out caring.

27:22.840 --> 27:23.807
To no avail.

27:23.840 --> 27:26.809
A grand unifying theory

27:26.840 --> 27:29.070
of Simon de Merville
has yet to present itself.

27:29.110 --> 27:31.078
Almost everything
on his criminal CV

27:31.110 --> 27:33.078
can be chalked up to
sadism and misogyny.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.338
But Melanie Vilkas...

27:34.380 --> 27:37.042
Was a message.
Presumably to Kitty.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.446
Was meant to be the beginning
of something.
Only he fell out

27:39.490 --> 27:41.879
with the Albanians before
he could make his next move.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.410
Well, that's a good thing,
right?
It makes

27:43.460 --> 27:46.258
divining a pattern in his
behavior considerably harder.

27:46.290 --> 27:49.896
A fugitive is more difficult
to anticipate than an obsessive.

27:49.930 --> 27:52.364
Your new employer,
did he agree to help us?

27:52.400 --> 27:54.937
(phone ringing)
Actually, I spoke to him,
and he... (sighs)

27:57.770 --> 27:59.328
Captain.

27:59.370 --> 28:01.838
Hey. You're not gonna believe
who just called to say

28:01.880 --> 28:05.247
they're coming to the station
tomorrow morning.

28:05.280 --> 28:08.317
Simon's the only family
I've got left.

28:10.750 --> 28:13.958
I know it's not
an excuse. It's just...

28:13.990 --> 28:16.379
I didn't know
he hurt those girls.

28:16.420 --> 28:19.321
But I wasn't surprised
either.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.157
He's always been...
different.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.964
Do you know where he is?
No, I swear.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.365
He didn't tell me
where he was going.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.322
He told me
his own people

28:27.370 --> 28:30.999
were trying to kill him.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.928
You said he
took something

28:32.970 --> 28:35.006
from the pharmacy, a medication?

28:35.040 --> 28:36.837
Esephera.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.440
It's an expensive drug,
so we keep it locked up.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.471
He had me
open the case.

28:41.520 --> 28:44.887
I was surprised
he even knew what Esephera was,

28:44.920 --> 28:47.047
but he knew exactly
what he was looking for.

28:47.090 --> 28:49.888
He even knew how much
we charged. It was strange.

28:49.920 --> 28:53.378
But I thought
it was for someone he knew.

28:53.430 --> 28:55.352
Only you don't know who.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.832
So that's it?

29:00.870 --> 29:03.236
You're just here to
clear your conscience?

29:07.570 --> 29:09.401
Uh,

29:09.440 --> 29:12.409
I have a phone number for Simon.

29:12.450 --> 29:16.238
He gave it to me
at the pharmacy.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.089
He told me to leave a message

29:18.120 --> 29:20.088
if I got my hands
on more Esephera

29:24.030 --> 29:26.419
If you want,

29:26.460 --> 29:29.156
I was thinking
I could try to get him

29:29.200 --> 29:32.829
t-to meet with me.

29:35.170 --> 29:37.092
(phone ringing)

29:37.140 --> 29:39.938
We're ready.

29:39.970 --> 29:41.107
You can take it.

29:44.610 --> 29:45.941
You got my message?

29:45.980 --> 29:48.312
I told you, I check every hour.

29:48.350 --> 29:49.840
What is it?

29:49.880 --> 29:51.086
I just thought
you'd want to know

29:51.120 --> 29:52.815
the police came
and asked about you.

29:52.850 --> 29:54.488
They knew
you were at the hospital.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.351
We figured that would happen.

29:56.390 --> 29:58.153
Why did you call me?

29:58.190 --> 30:00.454
You said if I could get
more Esephera, I should...

30:00.490 --> 30:03.789
Forget about that.
What you gave me was enough.

30:06.630 --> 30:09.997
I think I can get you a car.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.304
If you want
to get out of town.

30:12.340 --> 30:15.468
My friend has one
I can borrow.

30:15.510 --> 30:18.502
I could leave it for you
wherever you want.

30:18.550 --> 30:21.314
No. My face is
everywhere right now.

30:21.350 --> 30:23.045
I got to ride this out.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.583
(mechanical rumble)
Just tell me you're okay.

30:25.620 --> 30:27.349
Are you someplace safe?

30:27.390 --> 30:29.585
IfI need anything,
I'll call you.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.019
Simon?

30:31.060 --> 30:32.857
He turned it off again.

30:32.890 --> 30:34.494
All I got was the tower.

30:34.530 --> 30:35.622
We couldn't get
a second or third ping.

30:35.660 --> 30:38.265
It only gives us the radius.

30:40.230 --> 30:42.892
Does your brother have any
friends near Gerritsen Beach?

30:42.940 --> 30:44.339
No.

30:44.370 --> 30:47.168
There are probably 50,000 people
in that circle.

30:47.210 --> 30:50.031
But far fewer boats.
And only two marinas.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.877
Tell me, does your brother make
the habit of talking

30:51.910 --> 30:53.605
on the phone
whilst he's micturating?

30:54.920 --> 30:55.909
What?

30:55.950 --> 30:57.212
Play it back.

30:57.250 --> 30:58.478
You'll hear the sound
of a man urinating

30:58.520 --> 30:59.646
into a plastic bowl.

30:59.690 --> 31:01.555
The garbled machine sound
at the end

31:01.590 --> 31:04.525
is the flushing
of an electric marine toilet.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.585
Simon de Merville's on a boat.

31:06.630 --> 31:07.585
GREGSON:
Play it back.

31:07.630 --> 31:08.619
Just the end.

31:12.130 --> 31:13.324
Tell me something good.

31:13.370 --> 31:15.634
No sign of De Merville
as of yet.

31:15.670 --> 31:17.638
How's it going
at the other marina?

31:17.670 --> 31:19.638
He's not here. We're gonna go
over this place with a comb

31:19.670 --> 31:20.932
and then head to you.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.130
Remind your people to go slow.

31:23.180 --> 31:25.978
Even identifying a place
he used to be is something.

31:26.010 --> 31:27.910
Yeah, I'll keep you posted.

31:29.650 --> 31:31.982
(siren wailing in distance)

31:33.290 --> 31:35.281
You should breathe.

31:35.320 --> 31:39.359
You're sure that sound
was a t0ilet flushing?

31:39.390 --> 31:42.029
Those of us with _
exceptional senSItIVIties

31:42.060 --> 31:44.028
are prone to
motion sickness.

31:44.070 --> 31:46.664
I've spent a bit
of time on boats.

31:46.700 --> 31:49.965
And_ an electric marine
t0ilet is something I know.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.366
What I don't know

31:52.410 --> 31:56.005
is how Violet de Merville grew
a conscience overnight.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.001
She probably consulted a lavwer,

32:00.050 --> 32:02.974
realized how much trouble she'd
have been in for helping him.

32:03.020 --> 32:05.614
I sensed she was more eager
to gain your approval.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.587
How'd that meeting go
last night?

32:09.620 --> 32:11.258
Del just sent the list
from the IRB,

32:11.290 --> 32:13.224
but there are no
matches for anyone

32:13.260 --> 32:14.659
with PNH in this zip code.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.429
HOLMES:
We know De Merville
was on a boat.

32:16.460 --> 32:18.291
We know he called
from this vicinity.

32:18.330 --> 32:20.025
If he's already sold
the Esephera, perhaps

32:20.070 --> 32:21.537
he made enough
to buy himself a vessel.

32:21.570 --> 32:23.731
Or he used the cash
to buy his way back

32:23.770 --> 32:26.534
into the good graces of his
partners, or we've been wrong

32:26.570 --> 32:28.709
about what the bloody Esephera
was for all along.

32:28.740 --> 32:31.402
(phone ringing)

32:32.650 --> 32:34.379
Yup.

32:34.420 --> 32:35.739
He's not here.

32:35.780 --> 32:37.645
Dock master's got a camera
hidden over here.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.045
No Simon de Merville,

32:39.090 --> 32:41.581
nobody, period, last three days.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.759
Look, I'm, uh... I'm sorry,

32:43.790 --> 32:46.281
but we got to send our people
back to their commands.

32:49.660 --> 32:51.662
Hey?

32:53.200 --> 32:55.168
You still there?

32:55.200 --> 32:56.690
Don't.

32:56.740 --> 32:58.298
Don't what?

32:58.340 --> 32:59.762
Don't send them home.

32:59.810 --> 33:03.473
In fact, tell them not
to take off their gear.

33:03.510 --> 33:05.705
Push the snapper, push the bass.

33:05.750 --> 33:09.379
Serve ten of each tonight,
we're having shots on me.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.012
Hey, guys.

33:11.050 --> 33:13.018
We'll be open in ten
minutes, you want to wait.

33:13.050 --> 33:14.551
Oh, we're not here for a table,
Mr. Osweiler.

33:14.590 --> 33:17.013
We want to talk to you about
your old neighbor in Queens.

33:17.060 --> 33:18.220
Simon de Merville?

33:18.260 --> 33:20.387
Yeah, sure.

33:20.430 --> 33:23.058
All right, everybody, hit it.

33:23.830 --> 33:26.697
I saw about Simon
on the news.

33:26.730 --> 33:29.096
Can't say I was surprised.

33:29.140 --> 33:31.165
I mean, guy always
gave me the creeps.

33:31.210 --> 33:34.532
Strange, then, that he recently
took up residence in your boat.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.229
One that used to sit
in the driveway

33:36.280 --> 33:38.043
you shared with his brothel.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.342
HOLMES:
You moved to this area

33:39.380 --> 33:40.779
a couple of months ago,
didn't you?

33:40.810 --> 33:42.573
Your 27-foot Catalina
came With you.

33:42.620 --> 33:44.508
How do I know this, you ask?

33:44.550 --> 33:46.541
Artificial turf.
What?

33:46.590 --> 33:48.182
You left swatches
of artificial turf behind

33:48.220 --> 33:49.778
when you walked out
on your lease.

33:49.820 --> 33:51.822
I barely registered them
the other day.

33:51.860 --> 33:54.693
And I just realized, artificial
turf is used to pad trailers

33:54.730 --> 33:56.254
and protect the hulls
of the boats that they carry.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.097
BELL:
Now, we searched two marinas

33:58.130 --> 33:59.791
for De Merville today.

33:59.830 --> 34:02.435
Only, he isn't in a boat
parked in the water, is he?

34:02.470 --> 34:04.734
He's in a boat parked on land.
Your boat.

34:04.770 --> 34:06.635
You obviously got to know him.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.535
How else would he know _about
your son's blood condition?

34:08.580 --> 34:09.831
Who told you about...?
When it occurred to us

34:09.880 --> 34:11.438
to look for a boat
that used to sit

34:11.480 --> 34:13.072
outside his workplace,

34:13.110 --> 34:15.317
we encountered some
of your old neighbors.

34:15.350 --> 34:16.840
They miss little Ethan,

34:16.880 --> 34:18.279
wish him well.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.117
BELL:
Right now
a warrant's being issued

34:20.150 --> 34:21.856
to search the _boat
at your new re5idence.

34:21.890 --> 34:24.154
ESU's prepping
a tactical approach.

34:24.190 --> 34:25.782
They'll go in hard
if they have to.

34:25.830 --> 34:27.354
This is happening,
and you don't want

34:27.390 --> 34:29.199
your family in the
house when it does.

34:29.230 --> 34:31.095
We want you
to help us clear them out

34:31.130 --> 34:32.392
without tipping Simon off.

34:32.430 --> 34:36.230
He just... showed up yesterday.

34:36.270 --> 34:38.158
He's not a friend.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.804
In fact, we moved
to get away from that place.

34:40.840 --> 34:42.876
He had the medication
Ethan needs.

34:42.910 --> 34:43.808
Enough to treat
him for months.

34:43.840 --> 34:46.172
All right, Mr. Osweiler--
your family--

34:46.210 --> 34:48.678
is there a chance De Merville's
with them, or isn't there?

34:48.720 --> 34:49.641
The deal was, he stays on the
boat, but I'll call my wife

34:49.680 --> 34:52.342
right now, I'll tell her
whatever you think.

34:52.390 --> 34:53.846
(phone ringing)
Well, hold on.

34:53.890 --> 34:57.189
I was just about
to call you, Captain.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.721
Mr. Osweiler's agreed
to call his wife for us.

34:58.760 --> 34:59.658
GREGSON:
Well, he should get to it.

34:59.690 --> 35:01.419
She's pretty upset.

35:01.460 --> 35:02.791
You're already with her?

35:02.830 --> 35:06.220
Local precinct got a 911
call from Mrs. Osweiler.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.568
She was calling
to report a fire.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.898
Somebody torched the boat.

35:10.940 --> 35:12.237
I don't understand.
You're saying

35:12.270 --> 35:13.464
we missed De Merville again?

35:13.510 --> 35:14.909
Actually, we don't
think we did.

35:14.940 --> 35:16.498
There was a body inside.

35:16.540 --> 35:18.906
The door was nailed shut.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.612
It's gonna take dental records
to know for sure, but I think

35:21.650 --> 35:24.915
De Merville's Albanian
friends caught up with him.

35:24.950 --> 35:27.145
I think
this whole thing is over.

35:43.240 --> 35:44.867
You wished to see me?

35:44.910 --> 35:47.265
Is Kitty with you?

35:47.310 --> 35:49.938
No. She's gone to the, uh...
to the morgue to await

35:49.980 --> 35:51.743
the M.E.'s report.

35:51.780 --> 35:53.475
You can understand
how eager she is

35:53.510 --> 35:55.273
to put an official end
to this matter.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.470
Eager is an understatement.

35:57.520 --> 35:58.748
Close the door.

36:06.260 --> 36:07.682
Something troubles you?

36:07.730 --> 36:09.721
Tell me the truth.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.661
Did you know about her visit to
Violet de Merville's apartment?

36:12.700 --> 36:15.237
After the fact.

36:15.270 --> 36:19.263
Well, Ms. De Merville paid us
another visit tonight.

36:19.310 --> 36:21.676
Very different attitude
this time around.

36:21.710 --> 36:24.474
I thought she was
just upset about her brother.

36:25.950 --> 36:29.374
But there was more.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.951
(sighs)

36:45.500 --> 36:47.718
She claims that Kitty did this.

36:49.470 --> 36:51.904
You believe her?

36:53.740 --> 36:55.879
And so do you.

36:55.910 --> 36:57.707
Captain, you were there

36:57.740 --> 37:00.470
when Ms. De Merville
offered us her a55istance.

37:00.510 --> 37:04.287
Her invaluable... assistance.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.286
Did she seem coerced
at the time?

37:09.320 --> 37:11.288
Kitty has a knack

37:11.330 --> 37:13.855
for bringing people around
to her way of seeing things.

37:13.890 --> 37:15.528
Trust me.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.755
I looked the other way
once before.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.825
I shouldn't have.

37:19.870 --> 37:21.963
I will talk to her.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.766
I'm gonna have to suspend her
association with the department.

37:27.940 --> 37:30.773
Will you allow me
to convey the news myself?

37:34.850 --> 37:37.842
It's him--
Simon de Merville.

37:37.880 --> 37:41.350
His dental records
matched perfectly.

37:43.860 --> 37:45.851
Well...

37:45.890 --> 37:49.326
He's not the man who raped me.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.397
What?

37:52.430 --> 37:54.694
(sighs)

37:54.740 --> 37:56.560
Look at the right hand.

37:56.600 --> 38:00.969
It's perfectly intact.

38:01.010 --> 38:03.831
The night you escaped, you said
you broke some of his fingers.

38:05.980 --> 38:08.540
My bindings slipped
when he was moving me.

38:10.820 --> 38:14.779
I knew I wouldn't get
another chance, so, when he...

38:14.820 --> 38:19.621
reached for me, I wrenched his
fingers back as hard as I could.

38:21.830 --> 38:23.991
The way he screamed.

38:24.030 --> 38:27.864
I'm not the only one who
left that room with scars.

38:27.900 --> 38:31.529
We ought to be looking at
screws or a metal plate,

38:31.570 --> 38:34.334
or-or some kind of seam
where the bones set.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.473
Extensive damage
to his flexor

38:36.510 --> 38:38.375
and extensor tendons,
to his median nerve,

38:38.410 --> 38:40.446
would have felt, to you,
like breaking bones.

38:40.480 --> 38:41.970
It's not him.

38:46.150 --> 38:49.859
You think I'm mad, don't you?

38:52.860 --> 38:55.158
I think I know something
of how you're feeling.

38:59.030 --> 39:00.691
(sighs)

39:00.730 --> 39:03.836
For me, for quite some time,

39:03.870 --> 39:08.534
the idea of a...
of a sober existence--

39:08.580 --> 39:10.707
it was my fuel and my purpose.

39:10.740 --> 39:13.607
I dare say that it dominated
my consciousness.

39:15.920 --> 39:20.448
Then, I-I had to acknowledge
one day that, for me,

39:20.490 --> 39:24.950
sobriety was a struggle,
not a state of being.

39:27.530 --> 39:30.658
A sense of closure
would never come.

39:33.630 --> 39:38.090
Accepting that moment was
as difficult as arriving at it.

39:40.110 --> 39:43.773
So it's denial, is it?

39:45.480 --> 39:48.074
I want this man who hurt me
to still be alive,

39:48.110 --> 39:50.613
to still be out there,
hurting other people.

39:50.650 --> 39:52.413
I won't pretend for a moment

39:52.450 --> 39:54.589
that there aren't questions
that need answering,

39:54.620 --> 39:57.418
but every piece of evidence
that we have can be reviewed,

39:57.460 --> 39:59.781
every assumption we'd ever made
can be reexamined.

39:59.830 --> 40:01.695
I will help you do that,

40:01.730 --> 40:04.460
but you should prepare yourself
for the possibility

40:04.500 --> 40:07.867
that your uncertainty...

40:07.900 --> 40:10.130
is the only uncertainty

40:10.170 --> 40:12.730
that remains.

40:16.510 --> 40:19.001
Someone hurt me, Sherlock.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.974
You hurt yourself.

40:23.150 --> 40:25.789
You don't know anything

40:25.820 --> 40:28.948
about how I am feeling.

40:37.660 --> 40:40.720
(phone ringing)

40:40.770 --> 40:42.965
Hello.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.661
Hey, it's Del.

40:44.710 --> 40:46.200
I tried you
on the company phone,

40:46.240 --> 40:47.969
but it went straight
to voice mail.

40:48.010 --> 40:50.001
Hold on.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.508
Oh, it's dead.
I'm sorry.

40:55.050 --> 40:56.540
Today was sort of crazy.

40:56.580 --> 40:58.844
I know.
I-I'm watching the news.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.846
The man you were looking for
was killed.

41:00.890 --> 41:03.518
I... I'm not sure
if that's what you wanted, but,

41:03.560 --> 41:05.926
well, at least it's over, right?

41:05.960 --> 41:08.121
Yeah, at least it's over.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.889
Does_ this mean
you're coming back to work?

41:09.930 --> 41:11.659
Actually, I was hoping
to take an extra day.

41:11.700 --> 41:13.258
Just want to make sure
my friend is okay.

41:13.300 --> 41:15.097
Well, of course.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.960
I-I can't thank you enough
for-for all your help.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.604
I didn't do anything.

41:18.640 --> 41:20.005
Del.

41:20.040 --> 41:21.268
Repeat after me, Joan.

41:21.310 --> 41:22.902
"I didn't do anything."

41:22.940 --> 41:24.498
Okay, you didn't do anything.

41:24.550 --> 41:26.745
I was already grateful
for the opportunity,

41:26.780 --> 41:27.974
and now I'm indebted to you.

41:28.010 --> 41:29.910
I'm gonna do great work for you.

41:29.950 --> 41:32.111
Well, that was never in doubt.
Have a good night, Joan.

41:32.150 --> 41:33.742
I'll see you in two days.

41:33.790 --> 41:36.111
Okay. Bye.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.014
KITTY:
Who was that?
(gasps)

41:38.060 --> 41:40.779
Kitty, what are you doing...?
Who was that?

41:40.830 --> 41:43.697
My boss at Leda.
Del Gruner. Why?

41:49.700 --> 41:52.009
You said I could come
here if I ever needed to.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.873
You gave me a key.

41:54.910 --> 41:58.949
Kitty, tell me what's going on.

41:58.980 --> 42:01.949
Before we got De Merville
on the phone the other day,

42:01.980 --> 42:06.144
I wondered... what it would
be like to hear his voice again.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.181
After five years,

42:08.220 --> 42:12.224
what it would do to me, if
I would even recognize it.

42:12.260 --> 42:14.797
And I didn't, but...

42:14.830 --> 42:18.288
it had been so long,
so many years of just...

42:19.300 --> 42:21.768
I think the most important thing

42:21.800 --> 42:24.189
for potential investors
to understand is that

42:24.240 --> 42:26.060
fraud prevention
and fraud detection are both...
(groaning)

42:26.110 --> 42:27.907
...improving rapidly,
and insurance

42:27.940 --> 42:30.875
is a $4 trillion industry.

42:30.910 --> 42:32.172
(crying)

42:32.210 --> 42:33.768
I was wrong, Watson.

42:33.810 --> 42:36.074
I didn't forget the voice.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.714
I couldn't.

42:38.750 --> 42:46.225
De Merville didn't hurt me.
He did.

42:46.260 --> 42:48.251
