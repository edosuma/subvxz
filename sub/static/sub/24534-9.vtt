WEBVTT

01:44.520 --> 01:48.513
- Geta 10-13...
- Don’t mess with it.

02:37.400 --> 02:41.484
Al, 0’0 you copy?

02:41.660 --> 02:44.823
Hey, .4/, you copy?

02:46.950 --> 02:50.033
Al, do you copy?

02:50.120 --> 02:52.202
Hey. How's the leg, Morgan?

02:52.290 --> 02:54.997
It’s good. I’m doing all right.

02:55.210 --> 02:57.792
What's going on? Is John okay?

02:58.090 --> 02:59.421
John's fine.

03:01.430 --> 03:03.500
Hey, you remember
when you first interviewed me?

03:03.930 --> 03:06.091
I til/77k you mean
the only time I interviewed you.

03:06.180 --> 03:07.670
Yeah.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.637
You were asking questions
about where I came from.

03:10.730 --> 03:15.474
Yeah. The settlements.
The king, and his pet tiger.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.561
You finally ready to tell me
what I want to know?

03:17.650 --> 03:20.357
Well, no, no, no.
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.190
But I WIl/ Show you.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.576
I'm headed home, Al.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.201
Going back, and I want you to drive me.

03:51.810 --> 03:53.846
Hey, June.

03:55.520 --> 03:56.566
Morgan.

03:57.610 --> 03:58.599
Is John here?

04:06.370 --> 04:07.940
Virginia?

04:09.370 --> 04:10.530
Well...

04:10.870 --> 04:12.826
That's a long way from here.

04:13.830 --> 04:15.457
I never should have left.

04:17.130 --> 04:21.339
My friend, I think he was right.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.962
It's where I belong.
It's where I should be.

04:25.760 --> 04:30.459
Well, if that's what you think,
then that's where you should go.

04:37.770 --> 04:41.274
You could come. I mean, you all could.

04:41.610 --> 04:44.352
Alexandria is a good place
with good people.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.816
We'd be lucky to have you.

04:46.910 --> 04:49.481
I'm not sure
I'll make it in my current state.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.535
Morgan, I don't know if you will, either.

04:52.620 --> 04:57.319
My leg's fine. I made it before.
And with AI's help, I...

04:57.420 --> 05:00.583
You don't know what's out there.
No one does.

05:02.210 --> 05:04.428
I mean, I was thinkin' maybe,
June, Charlie, and me,

05:04.510 --> 05:08.594
go back to my cabin when I'm able.
And that's if I make the place safer.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.807
Even that idea
seems a little chuckleheaded

05:10.890 --> 05:12.300
'cause my cabin's far.

05:12.390 --> 05:14.881
But it ain't Virginia far.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.890
My mind's made up.

05:19.690 --> 05:20.759
Oh.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.067
Well, when you gonna go?

05:26.990 --> 05:29.026
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.571
Well, will you stay for dinner?

05:32.660 --> 05:37.199
It's fish, but I'm sure we've got
artichoke in a jar, or something.

05:37.290 --> 05:42.580
I can't. Got a few more stops I got
to make, before we leave in the morning.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.627
- Well, come by and say so long.
- I will.

05:48.970 --> 05:50.631
Maybe you'll have changed your mind.

05:52.470 --> 05:54.301
You know,
we got through a lot together, huh?

05:54.600 --> 05:56.386
Yes, sir.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.972
I mean,
things harder than making it to Virginia.

06:02.190 --> 06:07.389
I appreciate this offer. I do, but...

06:10.160 --> 06:13.618
I think I got
everything I need right here.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.281
Thank you.

07:19.140 --> 07:20.266
Apologies!

07:20.600 --> 07:25.105
We have a breach in the fence.
And it appears my aim is off.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.601
Door's unlocked.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.740
What do you think?

07:45.090 --> 07:48.127
I've been rotating the collection.

07:56.390 --> 08:00.975
It's a '61 Latour.
Much better than a '66.

08:02.390 --> 08:07.430
The wine cellar is quite extensive.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.451
Where is everybody?

08:28.170 --> 08:29.546
Luciana?

09:09.880 --> 09:11.586
I was hoping we could talk.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.040
I'm, erm...

09:15.720 --> 09:19.633
See, I'm heading back to Virginia.
Al is taking me.

09:21.140 --> 09:23.768
But we got room for everybody.

09:25.520 --> 09:29.479
A road trip?
I've had my fair share of those.

09:33.150 --> 09:35.232
I never want to _
set foot In that van again.

09:37.450 --> 09:41.113
What makes you think that we'd embark
on such a foolhardy journey?

09:41.370 --> 09:43.156
You know the kind of people we'd run into.

09:43.580 --> 09:44.899
People like us.

09:45.370 --> 09:47.418
I can't go out there.

09:48.420 --> 09:52.789
I've retired from scraping by
just to survive.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.620
Look around.

09:54.720 --> 09:58.963
I've found the best
this crumbling piece of rock has to offer.

09:59.050 --> 10:01.598
There's nothing for me where you're going.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.722
There's nothing for me anywhere.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.437
Enjoy your trip.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.021
Travel safe.

10:17.490 --> 10:19.230
And Alicia?

10:21.450 --> 10:22.769
Where is she?

10:26.870 --> 10:29.577
She moved out of the main house.

10:29.670 --> 10:33.629
Well, I don't think she ever moved in.

10:34.550 --> 10:38.008
I think I saw her
down by the garden last week.

10:58.990 --> 11:00.355
Alicia?

11:02.450 --> 11:04.406
You here?

11:40.320 --> 11:42.356
Come on.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.497
Alicia, we need to talk.

11:53.580 --> 11:54.740
Can't. Not now.

12:02.090 --> 12:04.422
You've been through a lot.

12:04.510 --> 12:06.751
_ I know it doesn't seem like
It's ever gonna get any better,

12:06.850 --> 12:07.919
but I think I can help you.

12:08.010 --> 12:09.466
I don't need your help.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.882
Hey, Alicia. What are these?

12:15.810 --> 12:18.142
Oh, I didn't write those.

12:20.530 --> 12:23.602
But someone did,
and they're tacking them onto the dead.

12:24.990 --> 12:26.696
And that's why you're drawing them out?

12:29.330 --> 12:31.366
Well, one of them's got to have something.

12:37.090 --> 12:41.049
What you're doing here, it isn't safe.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.468
Someone needs help.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.046
There's no way of telling
when these were written,

12:47.140 --> 12:50.177
or if _whoever wrote them
IS even still alive.

12:51.560 --> 12:55.018
But there's other ways, you know,
to do what it is you're trying to do.

12:55.100 --> 12:58.479
Strand, Luciana, they said
they haven't seen you for weeks.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.855
Yeah, well, they won't help me with this.

12:59.940 --> 13:01.396
That's not what I mean.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.152
I'm heading back East in the morning,

13:06.530 --> 13:09.192
heading back where I came from,
and I think you should come along.

13:09.950 --> 13:13.158
I think it'd be good for you, and I think
you could do a lot of good there.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.281
Someone needs help here, now.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.245
You don't know that.

13:19.670 --> 13:22.753
You may end up getting yourself hurt.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.465
I'm leaving in the morning.

13:32.810 --> 13:35.017
You know where to find me
if you change your mind.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.127
Couple more weeks,
you'll be able to fish again.

14:01.210 --> 14:04.452
It's been so long,
you might have to teach me.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.338
- Do you mean it?
- Yeah.

14:10.510 --> 14:14.389
You've caught more widemouth bass this
past month than I have my entire life.

14:14.810 --> 14:17.222
No, John. Not that.

14:17.350 --> 14:21.354
What you said to Morgan,
about wanting to go back to the cabin.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.719
Oh, you heard that?

14:25.530 --> 14:28.567
Yeah, I said that, and I meant it.

14:31.660 --> 14:33.616
Do you think the cabin's even still there?

14:34.120 --> 14:36.953
Well, I locked the door before I left.
Do you not want to go?

14:37.040 --> 14:38.029
No, I didn't say that.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.122
It's just an idea I'm batting around.

14:40.210 --> 14:42.838
Given my condition
and the condition of everything...

14:42.920 --> 14:44.831
- John, it's okay.
- It's totally understandable.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.717
Ijust...

15:09.150 --> 15:10.196
Charlie!

15:14.830 --> 15:16.115
I got this, kid.

16:35.320 --> 16:38.699
These grapes were not meant for wrath.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.860
I think it's time we found that breach.

16:42.830 --> 16:46.493
Glad I came by to check on you guys
before heading out. She gonna be okay?

16:46.580 --> 16:48.662
Yeah, she'll be all right.

16:59.430 --> 17:00.590
Charlie...

17:02.390 --> 17:06.224
I want you to think about telling me
what just happened down there.

17:12.150 --> 17:13.526
Just think about it.

17:15.610 --> 17:17.407
She didn't even call for help.

17:17.490 --> 17:19.026
She doesn't say much these days.

17:19.120 --> 17:22.362
Thanks for your help. Appreciate it.

17:31.670 --> 17:33.581
How long have the dead been washing up?

17:33.670 --> 17:36.002
We've only seen it once before.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.387
Usually means
there's something amiss upriver.

17:39.430 --> 17:42.513
We gotta go see what's going on.
We'll start with that river up east...

17:42.600 --> 17:43.919
John, you're not up for it.

17:44.020 --> 17:47.842
Well, you can't go alone.
I'm coming with you.

17:47.940 --> 17:48.975
I'll go.

17:49.860 --> 17:50.929
You said you're leaving.

17:51.020 --> 17:52.772
Yeah, not till the morning.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.272
That bridge is a ways away.
If something goes wrong...

17:56.360 --> 17:58.271
You'll be the first to know.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.988
Here. I got another one in the truck.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.652
Keep it close.
Anything goes wrong, we'll call.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.365
You be careful.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.745
Same goes for you.

18:15.090 --> 18:19.049
I just tuned up the guns. We'll be fine.

18:20.510 --> 18:21.841
Okay.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.245
I know where they are.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.757
I was only looking at the note.
Not how they got onto the dead.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.839
It's AGL, a lumber mill
about 10 miles up the road.

19:03.010 --> 19:07.174
We passed it on the way in,
but it's overrun.

19:07.390 --> 19:08.971
The place will be full of walkers.

19:09.060 --> 19:12.393
So, whoever's writing these
needs more help than I thought.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.027
Okay.

19:17.530 --> 19:19.600
- I'll go check it out myself.
- No, I'm going with you.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.986
- You don't have to.
- I'm gomg.

19:46.760 --> 19:48.762
We're gonna have to backtrack.

19:48.850 --> 19:50.932
We can cut over to the river,
further north.

19:51.020 --> 19:54.183
No, I can clear this pretty easily
with the cable.

19:56.610 --> 19:58.146
Hold on.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.751
You ever seen one of these before?

20:20.840 --> 20:22.580
No.

20:23.130 --> 20:24.677
I'm gonna grab my camera.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.796
We need to keep moving.
We have to get back to John and Charlie.

20:26.890 --> 20:28.096
They'll be fine.

20:28.180 --> 20:32.139
I want to grab tape on this real quick.
Might be a story here.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.891
- What did he say about me?
- Who?

20:37.980 --> 20:41.359
John. I know you interviewed him before.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.690
That's not really how this works.

20:48.990 --> 20:50.946
He told me a lot about Laura.

20:52.580 --> 20:55.458
The others told me about Naomi.

20:58.290 --> 20:59.450
June.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.751
It's June.

21:06.050 --> 21:10.805
Yeah. No one said anything about a June.

21:11.850 --> 21:13.420
You want to tell me about her?

21:15.940 --> 21:17.396
You don't have to.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.896
I really just came here to help.

21:22.110 --> 21:24.237
I mean, I got my motives,

21:27.030 --> 21:28.406
but maybe it would help.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.116
Think about it.

21:43.210 --> 21:44.837
So, what happens after?

21:44.920 --> 21:48.629
You know, say you're right,
and we help this person.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.960
VVhatthen?

21:51.760 --> 21:53.887
Well, it won't matter to you.
You'll be on your way.

21:55.310 --> 21:57.551
Hey, I left in a rush, you know?

21:57.650 --> 22:00.141
I didn't even say goodbye to people.

22:01.610 --> 22:05.182
So, they don't know where I went,
or what happened to me.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.816
You just ran?

22:06.900 --> 22:10.609
Thought it was the only thing,
leaving them.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.077
I thought it's what I had to do.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.785
They might not be there any more, right?

22:19.880 --> 22:24.123
No, they're there. See, they're strong.

22:26.380 --> 22:28.462
Like you.

22:32.760 --> 22:35.012
That friend I told you I got back there.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.471
The one who said
I would find my way back to the world,

22:39.560 --> 22:41.357
back to people?

22:41.810 --> 22:43.858
See, I left straight after I heard that.

22:45.820 --> 22:50.268
To get away, you know,
to make it, so that he was wrong.

22:51.870 --> 22:56.034
I just want to look him in the eye
and tell him he was right.

22:56.120 --> 22:59.169
I think he deserves to know.

22:59.250 --> 23:01.571
'Cause he was.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.127
Hey.

23:06.050 --> 23:07.961
I'm just telling you

23:08.130 --> 23:10.883
because I don't want you to find out
one of the harder ways.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.440
Come on.

23:44.380 --> 23:47.838
That should keep the wolves
out of the hen house.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.370
Shall we adjourn to the cellar?

23:56.680 --> 23:58.090
What are we doing here?

23:59.680 --> 24:03.184
Enjoying the bounty of our discovery.

24:08.030 --> 24:09.065
Victor,

24:11.030 --> 24:12.486
I don't know what's left,

24:14.240 --> 24:18.574
where to be, what to fight for.

24:19.370 --> 24:23.204
I see we've been asking ourselves
the same questions.

24:23.290 --> 24:26.088
I'm at least gonna enjoy myself
while I ask them.

24:50.070 --> 24:51.185
Let's go.

24:51.280 --> 24:55.239
Wait. Whoever's asking for help,
they got a reason for asking.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.578
So, let's figure out why
before we go rushing in there.

24:57.660 --> 24:58.866
There's no time.

25:04.330 --> 25:06.036
You coming?

25:54.010 --> 25:57.218
Charlie, you don't have to talk.
You don't have to say anything.

25:58.930 --> 26:00.750
But I do want to ask you a favour.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.175
Will you play a game with me?

26:08.270 --> 26:09.510
Okay?

26:26.040 --> 26:30.454
I even made some extra 25, in case
you had a hankering for pizza, word wise.

26:39.590 --> 26:40.716
Okay.

26:43.810 --> 26:45.175
You want to go first?

26:51.690 --> 26:56.389
You know, there was a time
I didn't talk much, either.

26:59.570 --> 27:00.901
I had done something

27:02.780 --> 27:04.281
I wasn't too proud of,

27:06.540 --> 27:09.668
a sort of thing
that just won't let you be.

27:11.750 --> 27:15.538
And you're thinking on it,
and you're thinking on it. It starts to...

27:17.800 --> 27:20.257
Starts to eat away at you,

27:22.350 --> 27:26.559
till you start thinking,
maybe there'll be nothing left.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.767
Nothing worth keeping, anyway.

27:33.650 --> 27:35.356
But then, something happened.

27:37.190 --> 27:39.146
I found somebody to talk to.

27:40.570 --> 27:42.868
Well, she found me.

27:42.950 --> 27:47.159
But the point is, telling her,

27:50.120 --> 27:51.951
it brought me back to the world.

27:54.130 --> 27:56.337
Allowed me to forgive myself.

28:02.550 --> 28:07.590
I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I overstepped.
I just thought it was worth saying.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.055
You can play a word
whenever you want, you know?

28:22.780 --> 28:25.317
You wait here. I'll be right back.

29:26.140 --> 29:28.506
Nice to see you ambulatory again.

29:28.890 --> 29:32.018
Yeah. I got a good nurse.

29:33.810 --> 29:37.974
You caught me doing
a little light housekeeping.

29:38.060 --> 29:40.688
So, what do I owe the pleasure?

29:40.780 --> 29:43.487
I need your help. Charlie took off.

29:43.610 --> 29:45.817
She's out there on her own somewhere.

29:45.990 --> 29:47.867
Given my physical limitations,

29:47.950 --> 29:51.283
I'm worried if I look for her by myself,
she gonna remain that way.

29:52.410 --> 29:54.366
You do realize who you're coming to.

29:54.460 --> 30:00.660
Yeah. June and Al are miles away.
Morgan, I'm not sure where he is...

30:00.750 --> 30:03.833
What makes you think I would help?
She shot my friend.

30:03.920 --> 30:07.048
Well, I took a bullet in the gut

30:07.130 --> 30:11.499
on account of the people at this address,
yourself included.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.716
Way I see it, you owe me.

30:19.480 --> 30:22.187
I'll advise leaving Luciana out of it.

30:26.200 --> 30:29.943
You'll have to drive.
I've been drinking rather heavily today.

30:30.030 --> 30:31.691
- Great.
- Okay.

30:56.140 --> 30:59.724
There. That's where they're coming from.

31:41.850 --> 31:46.469
There. They've got him
trapped in that room.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.390
Wait, no.

31:53.780 --> 31:57.409
- I'm doing this.
- I know. So, let me help you.

32:41.580 --> 32:43.207
No! You...

32:46.000 --> 32:47.080
Alicia.

32:47.170 --> 32:50.708
You're supposed to be alive.
You were... You were...

32:57.180 --> 32:59.057
He's been like that for days.

33:01.060 --> 33:03.597
You couldn't have saved him.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.822
If my mom would've found him,
she would've...

33:24.920 --> 33:27.161
She would've saved him.

33:35.760 --> 33:38.137
I was out there a long time,

33:41.640 --> 33:44.598
with Strand, Luciana, and Nick,

33:44.690 --> 33:47.147
looking for those people. That's why...

33:48.650 --> 33:52.222
That's what we did,
doing whatever we had to do.

33:56.070 --> 33:57.606
I was good at that. I...

33:59.280 --> 34:00.861
I was good at that.

34:00.950 --> 34:05.569
You mean like your mom used to be?
Before the stadium?

34:08.130 --> 34:12.419
She changed, though. So, you can change.

34:18.010 --> 34:19.966
I got a lot to make up for.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.670
I do, too.

34:32.860 --> 34:35.818
Why are you sleeping in the greenhouse?

34:38.780 --> 34:42.568
Yeah, looking to save this person,
that gave you a reason, didn't it?

34:42.660 --> 34:44.946
A reason to run away.

34:45.790 --> 34:47.360
But Strand and Luciana, they...

34:50.540 --> 34:52.417
They need you.

34:53.300 --> 34:57.589
You can help them, save them,
like your mom did.

34:58.300 --> 35:00.837
You can just be there for them.

35:09.020 --> 35:14.105
I could,
but you could be there for us, too, right?

35:23.740 --> 35:27.039
Then why are you leaving?

35:48.100 --> 35:52.309
We should check upriver.
Got to be coming from somewhere.

35:53.690 --> 35:55.897
Can you turn that off for a minute?

35:57.860 --> 35:59.430
I do want to talk. I just...

36:00.740 --> 36:03.061
Don't want him to hear
what I'm gonna say.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.696
Sure. If that's what it takes.

36:11.040 --> 36:14.624
John fell in love with Laura at the cabin.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.001
I am not Laura.

36:20.670 --> 36:24.754
I'm the woman who got scared and ran away.

36:24.850 --> 36:29.549
And not just from John.
From everyone else.

36:31.640 --> 36:32.971
It's who I am.

36:39.320 --> 36:42.027
John wants to go back to the cabin.

36:42.110 --> 36:45.489
And if we do, I'm afraid
he's gonna realize that I'm not Laura.

36:48.410 --> 36:50.287
Never was.

36:52.460 --> 36:55.167
And when he realizes that...

37:02.380 --> 37:03.756
Look, I don't...

37:06.300 --> 37:08.882
I don't really give advice.

37:10.020 --> 37:13.057
- Not really what I do.
- Okay.

37:17.770 --> 37:22.685
But since we're just talking,
you know, off the record,

37:23.990 --> 37:29.781
you're with John, every day, helping him,
nursing him back to health.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.828
That's who you are, now.

37:40.300 --> 37:44.623
Yesterday's yesterday. But today's today.

37:46.970 --> 37:50.929
And God knows if there'll be a tomorrow.

37:59.190 --> 38:01.010
I sound like my mom.

38:02.860 --> 38:06.444
It's kind of why I don't do this.

38:33.020 --> 38:34.760
The dead washing up,

38:37.310 --> 38:38.891
it's not from a bridge that's out.

38:40.310 --> 38:43.029
We have to get back. Now.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.416
No sign of her.

39:05.670 --> 39:07.661
Well, she has books from all over,

39:07.760 --> 39:11.639
a few from a middle school
in the next town. Let's go.

39:22.230 --> 39:24.141
You need to know I used to be a cop.

39:26.690 --> 39:28.738
I used to be a millionaire.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.697
Everybody used to be something.

39:35.160 --> 39:38.493
Well, is this your plan now? Just...

39:39.000 --> 39:40.160
You got a better one?

39:40.250 --> 39:42.161
Yeah, I do.

39:42.250 --> 39:45.993
Soon as I'm all healed,
and this is all sorted,

39:46.090 --> 39:50.709
June, Charlie, they'll be coming
to my cabin with me.

39:51.260 --> 39:54.423
And then? What happens after that?

39:56.430 --> 39:58.512
I'm still sorting that part out.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.050
Aren't we all?

40:04.060 --> 40:06.779
Hey, Alicia!

40:06.860 --> 40:09.181
We're done here, Morgan.
Thanks for your help.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.316
No, we need to find some place to hole up.

40:11.410 --> 40:13.696
I'll be fine on my own.

40:14.200 --> 40:17.363
- Hey!
- I said I'll be fine!

40:55.030 --> 40:56.110
Strand?

41:26.020 --> 41:27.100
Hey!

41:30.440 --> 41:31.395
Charlie!

41:31.490 --> 41:34.391
What do you want? What do you want?

41:36.780 --> 41:38.828
Haven't you done enough?

42:10.110 --> 42:11.316
Charlie!

42:23.450 --> 42:25.532
John, are you there? John?

42:25.620 --> 42:26.826
Yeah, where are you? Are you okay?

42:26.920 --> 42:30.287
There’s a storm. It’s coming your way.

42:30.380 --> 42:34.498
Yeah, yeah, it's here.
Where are you? Are you okay?

42:37.220 --> 42:38.380
June?

42:40.470 --> 42:44.179
June?June?

42:45.060 --> 42:48.097
John? John, do you copy?

42:50.150 --> 42:51.356
John, do you hear me?

42:58.610 --> 43:00.612
What are you doing? We need to get back.

43:01.070 --> 43:02.697
- Not in this.
- No, but John.

43:02.780 --> 43:06.659
When I welded a half-ton of artillery
to the roof, I made a few trade-offs.

43:06.750 --> 43:10.538
Driving in 100-mile-an-hour wind
was one of them.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.410
What the hell was that?

43:16.010 --> 43:17.250
Oh, Jesus!

43:23.140 --> 43:24.505
What?
