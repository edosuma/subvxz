Collins.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.431
Guess you know
why I'm here.

00:32.432 --> 00:34.567
I never thought
i would say this,

00:34.568 --> 00:37.470
but it is such a pleasure
to see you, Tobias.

00:37.471 --> 00:38.771
Let's make this quick.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.172
Why rush?

00:40.173 --> 00:41.741
Seeing you miserable,

00:41.742 --> 00:44.477
and longing for information
that only I can provide,

00:44.478 --> 00:46.379
is nothing short of magical.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.648
The day you abducted me,
you said happy wouldn't be able

00:48.649 --> 00:50.216
to accept my marriage proposal.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.617
You knew she had a husband.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.152
Tell me his name.

00:53.153 --> 00:56.222
(Inhales) Oh, my god.
You're so desperate.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.557
She dumped you, didn't she?
No.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.327
We're still together.
Tell me his name.

01:01.328 --> 01:04.363
How is she handling you
tracking down her better half?

01:04.364 --> 01:06.766
Begrudging acceptance.
Now, tell me his name.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.534
Only if you talk
to the prosecutor

01:08.535 --> 01:10.269
about reducing my sentence.

01:10.270 --> 01:11.203
I don't like this place.

01:14.107 --> 01:16.275
Real criminals in here.

01:16.276 --> 01:19.178
Fine. Deal.

01:19.179 --> 01:21.314
Was that your plan?

01:21.315 --> 01:23.516
(Laughing): Just to agree
to whatever I wanted?

01:23.517 --> 01:25.284
And then screw me over,

01:25.285 --> 01:27.386
because as desperate
as you are,

01:27.387 --> 01:29.221
you and I both know

01:29.222 --> 01:31.257
that you would never
let me out of here.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.125
Do you like Batman?

01:33.126 --> 01:34.360
I don't.

01:34.361 --> 01:37.563
Good guys are such a yawn.

01:37.564 --> 01:41.500
The bad guys,
they have real pizzazz.

01:41.501 --> 01:43.135
So...

01:43.136 --> 01:46.772
In honor of the great
super villain, the riddler...

01:47.374 --> 01:50.776
Hmm...

01:51.845 --> 01:53.479
The water doesn't lie still,

01:56.283 --> 01:58.284
but the water still lies.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.353
Add 50,

02:00.354 --> 02:02.588
and your answer
will be revealed.

02:02.589 --> 02:03.789
If you can figure out
that head-scratcher,

02:05.292 --> 02:07.326
you'll find the name
of happy's hubby.

02:07.327 --> 02:09.362
What do you mean,
"add 50"?

02:09.363 --> 02:11.564
Guard!

02:11.565 --> 02:13.899
Considering you have the
lowest IQ in all of scorpion,

02:13.900 --> 02:16.135
I do wish you
the best of luck, Tobias.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.304
Third lowest IQ.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.272
Yeah, if you count
the waitress and the cop.

02:20.273 --> 02:21.574
(Lock buzzes)

02:21.575 --> 02:24.210
Excited for your
field trip, Ralph?

02:25.545 --> 02:27.480
I hear that museum has
some amazing cars.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.914
Oh, you should check out
the '71 amx.

02:28.915 --> 02:30.416
It has this super fast...

02:30.417 --> 02:32.518
Happy told me
everything to look for.

02:32.519 --> 02:33.619
Great.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.688
She is the expert.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.256
Well, we should leave soon
because there's some

02:37.257 --> 02:38.624
political rally and
traffic's already terrible,

02:38.625 --> 02:39.725
and I have to
take you to lax.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.260
Yep.
(Clears throat)

02:41.261 --> 02:44.263
Tim isn't capable
of driving himself?
Ralph.

02:44.264 --> 02:45.831
Tim:
She's just doing
me a favor, buddy.

02:45.832 --> 02:49.301
But you know, this surveillance
seminar that I'm going to,

02:49.302 --> 02:51.771
it's only supposed to be
for homeland trainees,

02:51.772 --> 02:53.205
but if you would like,

02:53.206 --> 02:55.808
I could share some
of our secrets with you.

02:55.809 --> 02:56.208
Like how to spot a suspicious
person in a crowd.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.481
Toby taught me one
trait to be wary of

03:02.482 --> 03:04.417
is an overeagerness
to connect.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.285
It's a sign of duplicity.

03:06.286 --> 03:09.188
Yeah. But...

03:09.189 --> 03:11.557
Did he tell you that once
you've spotted a suspect,

03:11.558 --> 03:14.293
the best way to ID them
is to analyze their gait?

03:14.294 --> 03:16.328
See, it's a characteristic
as unique

03:16.329 --> 03:18.230
as a fingerprint, except,

03:18.231 --> 03:19.498
you don't need their prints
to get it.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.901
That's actually pretty cool.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.903
Mm-hmm.
Paige:
Well, speaking of gait,

03:23.904 --> 03:25.371
why don't you use yours
to refill your water bottle

03:25.372 --> 03:26.605
before the field trip?

03:26.606 --> 03:27.740
Hmm.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.709
Rhetorical question. Go.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.551
(Sighs)
Geniuses often
feel isolated,

03:38.552 --> 03:41.353
so they can be guarded
when people try to get close.
No.

03:41.354 --> 03:43.222
He is just a kid
who loves his mom.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.491
Okay? Trust me,
when I was his age,

03:45.492 --> 03:47.326
I was ten times worse
to my stepdad.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.962
No, Ralph is gonna
keep challenging me,

03:49.963 --> 03:51.263
and he is right to try
and protect you,

03:51.264 --> 03:52.698
because you are
an amazing woman

03:52.699 --> 03:55.267
and he is grateful
to have you in his life.

03:55.268 --> 03:56.502
Just like I am.

03:56.503 --> 03:59.672
You don't know how
refreshing that is,

04:01.308 --> 04:04.310
to spend time with
someone who is a normal,

04:04.311 --> 04:06.479
well-adjusted,
regular human being.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.713
Oh, come on. I know I haven't

04:07.714 --> 04:08.981
been around the team
as long as you,

04:08.982 --> 04:10.983
but they're not always
that bad, are they?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.485
(Pounding)

04:23.497 --> 04:25.931
Guys, please?

04:25.932 --> 04:27.032
We're almost done.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.335
You said that two hours ago.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.670
And it's really smoky in here.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.939
What are you doing, anyway?

04:33.940 --> 04:36.275
Just a project which will make
humanity eternally grateful.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.743
I'm fixing the hot dog.

04:37.744 --> 04:39.478
I didn't know hot dogs
were broken.

04:39.479 --> 04:41.013
Ready?
Mm-hmm.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.281
Everyone.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.451
Gather round.

04:52.058 --> 04:53.993
Are you tired of not having
enough room on your hot dog?

04:53.994 --> 04:57.396
Are you tired

04:57.397 --> 04:58.397
of condiments
constantly falling offof your hot dog?

04:58.398 --> 04:59.698
Are you frustrated with

04:59.699 --> 05:01.433
traditional tubular meats?

05:01.434 --> 05:02.401
Never been a problem.

05:02.402 --> 05:03.736
For anyone.

05:03.737 --> 05:04.970
Ever.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.505
What is this madness?

05:06.506 --> 05:06.739
If so, I proudly
present the u-dog.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.979
And increased surface area,

05:13.980 --> 05:15.981
allow for 50% more condiments
and 100% less mess.

05:15.982 --> 05:20.352
I wrote a jingle.

05:20.353 --> 05:21.887
(Blows harmonica chord)

05:21.888 --> 05:23.856
♪ It's the u-dog ♪

05:23.857 --> 05:25.357
♪ it's a me dog ♪

05:25.358 --> 05:26.792

i-can't-believe-what-i-see dog ♪

05:26.793 --> 05:28.961

and-cheese dog ♪

05:28.962 --> 05:31.397
♪ it's a u-dog. ♪

05:31.398 --> 05:33.933
I think we need
to retest your IQ.

05:39.005 --> 05:43.609
Elia suggested I find something

05:43.610 --> 05:45.878
to fill my time with
constructively.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.413
I should always
be using my gift.

05:48.715 --> 05:50.349
For u-dogs, right.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.617
Well, um, i-i know you're busy,

05:51.618 --> 05:53.752
but have you completed
the team evaluation?

05:53.753 --> 05:55.421
Homeland needs it
to re-up our contract.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.456
(Grunting)
Yeah. It's all there.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.458
Don't mind the Sauerkraut.

05:59.459 --> 06:00.826
Wait.

06:02.395 --> 06:05.431
You-you just, you just
stamped these satisfactory.You didn't even fill out
the comment section.

06:05.432 --> 06:06.699
Yes, I did.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.900
I wrote, "no comment".

06:07.901 --> 06:09.068
The team could use
some positive feedback.

06:09.069 --> 06:12.438
Every Friday,
they get a paycheck.

06:12.439 --> 06:13.572
That is their positive feedback.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.441
People need more than that,
Walter.

06:15.442 --> 06:16.976
Sly, raise the walls

06:16.977 --> 06:19.078
two centimeters
to increase mustard capacity,

06:19.079 --> 06:21.580
and get stats
on average mouth size.
Sly: On it.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.682
Fine, ignore me.
Just remember,

06:23.683 --> 06:25.918
you created scorpion for people
who feel ostracized

06:25.919 --> 06:27.987
and unappreciated,
and now you have your chance

06:27.988 --> 06:29.555
to show them your appreciation,
but you don't.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.724
In your parlance,
that's, uh, illogical.

06:37.864 --> 06:43.002
Toby:
Water doesn't lie still,
but the water still lies.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.671
Add 50.

06:45.672 --> 06:46.939
Question is, 50 what?

06:46.940 --> 06:49.408
I don't know what's
more grotesque,

06:49.409 --> 06:51.110
the stench of u-dog, or you
discussing our personal life

06:51.111 --> 06:53.178
with that lunatic Collins,

06:53.179 --> 06:54.713
and then falling
for his little trap.

06:54.714 --> 06:56.015
This is your doing.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.917
You are the trap
that I have fallen into.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.551
You.

06:59.552 --> 07:00.819
Dineen. Where
are you headed?

07:02.489 --> 07:03.923
Uh, picking up Ralph
from his field trip.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.858
Oh, I'm coming.
Paige: Sure.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.092
You want to be surrounded
by children?

07:07.093 --> 07:09.094
I already am.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.963
So the combustion engine
is nothing more than a device

07:14.000 --> 07:17.870
that creates
a controlled explosion.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.739
(Engine starting)

07:20.740 --> 07:23.642
(Children exclaiming)

07:29.516 --> 07:33.619
Hi, Daniel.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.853
How about we
go over there?

07:34.854 --> 07:37.189
(Car engine continues revving)

07:45.098 --> 07:45.631
Your screen froze.

07:45.632 --> 07:49.802
Want some help?

07:51.604 --> 07:52.471
The tablet has a flaw
in the eo-52 operating system.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.541
If it freezes,
or you forget your password,

07:55.542 --> 07:58.711
tap the power button quickly
three times,

07:58.712 --> 08:00.879
while swiping left.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.881
It'll turn on,
bypass the login

08:02.882 --> 08:04.116
and take you straight
to the command prompt.

08:04.117 --> 08:07.019
A little trick
my friend Walter told me.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.120
Daniel (Automated voice):
Thank you.

08:08.121 --> 08:11.757
Of course.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.692
The engine was loud
and you couldn't communicate.

08:13.693 --> 08:15.060
Scary.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.596
It's hard when people
don't understand you.

08:19.132 --> 08:22.067
Should we
get back to class?

08:23.536 --> 08:26.638
No.

08:26.639 --> 08:27.940
Joke.

08:29.809 --> 08:30.976
A good one.

08:30.977 --> 08:32.711
Come on.

08:37.150 --> 08:40.619
(Indistinct talking
and laughing)

08:45.158 --> 08:46.225
(Paige chuckles)

08:47.227 --> 08:50.562
Relax.
They don't bite.

08:50.563 --> 08:52.031
At least not after
the third grade.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.832
I don't get it.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.734
There are busses here.
Why pick him up?

08:55.735 --> 08:56.902
Uh, we-we talk
in the car.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.071
Is that what parents do?

08:59.072 --> 09:01.607
They look for ways to
spend time with their kids?That's... that's kind of the
whole point of having children.

09:01.608 --> 09:05.044
It wasn't for my parents.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.180
Paige:
Oh, there's Ralph's class.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.985
Wait. Why is security
leading them away?

09:12.986 --> 09:15.621
Hey, what's going on,
Ralph?

09:17.690 --> 09:19.258
Something's up.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.059
They clustered us together,
and ushered us out.Woman:
I always come early
to pick up my son,

09:20.060 --> 09:23.295
because he doesn't like
the noise of the busses.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.297
How could you not know
where he is?

09:25.298 --> 09:27.099
(Shouting):
Daniel!

09:27.100 --> 09:28.867
That's my friend's mom.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.102
Man:
I checked in all the busses.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.104
He's not there.
Oh, my god.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.172
Does he know your number
so he can call you?

09:33.173 --> 09:35.574
My son has nonverbal autism.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.609
The only way he can communicate
is with his tablet.

09:37.610 --> 09:40.045
That's how we can find him.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.748
I unfroze his tablet.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.149
I remember the serial number;
We can track it.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.851
Excuse me. I-i overheard.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.986
I work for the government;
We might be able to help.

09:47.987 --> 09:50.055
My son can track
Daniel's tablet.

09:50.056 --> 09:51.657
It has no locate function;
You can't track it.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.058
Scorpion can.

09:53.059 --> 09:55.961
What's scorpion?

09:55.962 --> 09:56.929
The smartest people
in the world.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.097
48, 49, 50.
Grapes?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.132
Yeah. It's the only thing
i had 50 of. I am desperate.

10:00.133 --> 10:04.937
(Phone rings)

10:04.938 --> 10:07.139
Frustrated riddle solvers
incorporated.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.374
You riddle, I fiddle.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.143
Paige? What the...
Slow down.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.878
Guys, we got a problem.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.148
Missing kid.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.150
Paige,
fill 'em in.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.118
It's not just a missing kid.
It's a nonverbal boy

10:19.118 --> 10:20.786
with autism.
Daniel klein.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.955
The mother is terrified.
Cabe:
There's a division

10:22.956 --> 10:24.623
of LAPD that specializes
in this.
Paige: They've been notified.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.225
Amber alert's been issued.
Walter:
Well, the thing is,

10:26.226 --> 10:29.127
people with autism have minds
that work differently than most.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.063
You can't
really follow

10:31.064 --> 10:33.966
the standard
missing person protocol.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.167
Kids with autism
often wander off,

10:35.168 --> 10:37.135
and the results
can be tragically fatal.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.004
The odds of finding him alive
drop with every passing minute.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.939
Which is why scorpion needs
to get down here. Walter,

10:40.940 --> 10:43.141
I know this is not
a typical case,

10:43.142 --> 10:45.711
but this is Ralph's friend.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.112
And he's out
there alone

10:47.113 --> 10:48.280
and he's scared.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.381
Okay, cabe and i
are heading out. Okay, be sure to take Alameda

10:49.382 --> 10:52.851
to avoid the traffic
from that political rally.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.152
Ralph:
Sylvester, Daniel uses

10:54.153 --> 10:56.255
a tablet communicator.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.990
I saw
the serial number.

10:57.991 --> 10:58.991
I just texted it to you.

10:58.992 --> 10:59.992
You can try to trace it.
On it.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.693
Guys, uh,
not trying

11:01.694 --> 11:03.996
to be morbid,
but have the authorities check

11:03.997 --> 11:05.864
<i>earby rivers and storm drains.</i>

11:05.865 --> 11:07.799
Kids with autism
are often drawn

11:07.800 --> 11:09.234
to bodies of water.
It's a common pathology.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.903
Problem is, it can result
in a drowned child.

11:13.039 --> 11:16.441
Is this everything
for the exits?

11:16.442 --> 11:20.412
All our footage.
It doesn't help.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.047
The school buses
are blocking the camera,

11:22.048 --> 11:24.283
so we didn't catch
Daniel leaving.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.151
Remember when I was talking
to Tim today

11:26.152 --> 11:27.419
about suspicion markers?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.087
Yeah. Why?
I saw a man

11:29.088 --> 11:30.722
with two markers
that Toby taught me to look for.

11:30.723 --> 11:32.424
He had his hat pulled down
an inch lower than normal.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.927
And he checked behind him twice
in eight seconds.
Toby: You're right.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.896
That is unusual.
Happy:
Pulling up

11:37.897 --> 11:40.432
the interior footage.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.000
I-I've been tracking
the Wi-Fi networks

11:43.403 --> 11:45.003
in a small radius
around the museum.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.772
I've got a signal
for Daniel's tablet

11:46.773 --> 11:48.740
moving east on temple

11:48.741 --> 11:50.075
just past spring. I'll send it
to your devices now.

11:50.076 --> 11:52.377
There's Daniel. Looks like he's
entering a parking structure

11:52.378 --> 11:55.180
between temple and first.

11:55.181 --> 11:57.716
(Tires screech)

11:57.717 --> 11:59.084
Ralph:
Daniel put
his tablet down

11:59.085 --> 12:01.787
to play the
driving game.

12:06.025 --> 12:06.158
Linking to your monitors.

12:06.159 --> 12:10.896
Good work, Ralph.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.865
He's definitely up to something.
Now, the question is what.

12:13.866 --> 12:15.167
You got to be kidding me.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.172
(Laptop chimes)

12:20.974 --> 12:21.807
I've got a ping
on Daniel.

12:21.808 --> 12:25.110
He's on the second floor.

12:25.111 --> 12:26.178
I'll go on foot.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.479
You drive to the exit
and head him off.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.880
Okay.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.316
(Grunting)

12:31.918 --> 12:33.385
(Tires screech)

12:33.386 --> 12:35.988
They're close.
Thank god.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.391
Paige:
He's really into

12:41.527 --> 12:43.929
that garbage can.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.197
He's looking for something.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.066
But it's an awfully specific
place to search. Almost looks like a dead drop.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.134
A dead drop?

12:49.135 --> 12:52.437
A-a covert handoff.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.139
One person leaves something
in a public place

12:54.140 --> 12:55.207
for someone else to pick up.
Toby:
And the museum is

12:55.208 --> 12:56.541
the perfect place.

12:56.542 --> 12:58.210
It's crowded enough that
they won't be noticed,

12:58.211 --> 13:00.078
and the loud engines
provide cover.

13:00.079 --> 13:01.513
Circling around to the exit.
Do you see him, cabe?

13:01.514 --> 13:04.016
Negative.
He wasn't on the second floor.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.517
I'm tracking the dot.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.853
Homeland. Excuse me.

13:07.854 --> 13:10.122
Right there. He just took
Daniel's communicator.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.990
Why would he do that?
Toby: He must have thought
it was for him.

13:11.991 --> 13:14.059
That was a mix-up.
Happy:
The man making

13:14.060 --> 13:17.062
the drop-off must've been late.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.164
There. That's got to be him now.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.167
His tablet's the same
as Daniel's.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.342
Toby:
Oh, Daniel must have thought

13:30.343 --> 13:34.446
someone moved his tablet.

13:34.447 --> 13:39.151
He took theirs
by mistake.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.119
Not good.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.354
(Indistinct chatter)

13:42.355 --> 13:44.156
Happy: Cabe,
you're not tracking Daniel.

13:45.324 --> 13:48.260
You're tracking the guy
that took his tablet.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.961
Toby:
And from what we've seen,

13:49.962 --> 13:51.263
he may not be a nice guy.
Copy that.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.965
I'm on him now.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.234
Excuse me, sir?

14:00.373 --> 14:02.274
Yes.
I'm trying to find

14:02.275 --> 14:04.042
an electronic tablet that
was lost at the auto museum.

14:04.043 --> 14:05.110
You weren't there by any
chance today, were you?

14:05.111 --> 14:07.079
As a matter of fact, I was.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.947
Hopefully I didn't grab
the wrong one.

14:08.948 --> 14:11.516
Wife gave it to me
for Christmas.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.319
Feel free to take a look.

14:16.055 --> 14:18.290
(Grunting)

14:18.291 --> 14:19.991
Paige:
Cabe,

14:21.060 --> 14:23.395
are you okay?

14:23.396 --> 14:24.296
(Grunting)I'd say that's a no.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.864
(Grunting)

14:30.203 --> 14:32.270
(Grunting)

14:38.177 --> 14:40.445
(Groaning)

14:40.446 --> 14:42.481
(Grunting)

14:48.421 --> 14:50.355
(Tires screech)

14:50.990 --> 14:52.591
Cabe.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.562
Get down, get down.
I'm okay.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.296
Where did they go?

15:01.901 --> 15:03.969
Guys, they got away.
Jill:
What about my son?

15:03.970 --> 15:07.205
I-is there any sign of my son?

15:07.206 --> 15:12.177
No. Just his tablet.

15:14.213 --> 15:15.514
So they had his tablet

15:15.515 --> 15:16.348
and Daniel
has theirs.
Toby: And I'm guessin'

15:16.349 --> 15:19.217
theirs is trackable
and they're trying to find it.
Jill: If Daniel saw someone coming after him,
he'd be terrified.

15:19.218 --> 15:21.253
Toby:
Yeah, that's probably
why he ran.

15:21.254 --> 15:26.258
He sensed danger
and he took off.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.193
He-he was smart.
He took care of himself.
Sylvester: Except now

15:28.194 --> 15:29.427
we have a child lost
in the city,

15:29.428 --> 15:31.429
and we have no idea where he is.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.299
Cabe:
It just got worse.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.101
I saw a brand
on that guy's chest.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.536
An initiation rite
for the s6.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.171
International mercenary ring.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.173
And if they're in town,

15:41.174 --> 15:43.275
they're up to something big.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.110
And that tablet has got
to play a part in it.Which means they will do
anything to get it back.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.045
We have to find Daniel fast.
Before they do.

15:52.985 --> 15:55.353
Happy:
Ronen Cole and Lars Owens.
S6 operatives.

15:55.354 --> 16:03.354
Smuggling,

16:05.064 --> 16:10.068
murder-for-hire,
black ops.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.736
No clue
what they need the tablet for,

16:11.737 --> 16:13.438
but it's probably not
to play <i>pokémon go.</i>

16:13.439 --> 16:15.373
So Daniel's somewhere
in the city

16:15.374 --> 16:17.475
with mercenaries
after him.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.078
LAPD has alerts out
to all mobile units

16:20.079 --> 16:22.047
but nothing so far.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.648
They'll never find him.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.353
Walter...
Anyone who's approaching this

16:28.354 --> 16:29.054
like a normal missing persons
case will never find him. They'll fail.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.589
Daniel's autism means

16:30.590 --> 16:34.326
he sees the world
in a unique way.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.327
So to track him, we must try,
no matter how imperfectly,

16:35.328 --> 16:36.494
to imagine things
from his perspective.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.163
Toby:
Since every child with autism

16:38.164 --> 16:41.099
is different, the expert
on Daniel is his mom. Jill,

16:41.100 --> 16:42.734
can you please tell us
more about your son?

16:42.735 --> 16:45.070
Daniel doesn't experience
the world like we do.

16:45.071 --> 16:48.373
<i>Daniel experiences
sensory overload.</i>

16:48.374 --> 16:50.175
<i>Sounds are magnified.</i>

16:50.176 --> 16:53.178
<i>Lights appear
blindingly bright.</i>

16:53.179 --> 16:56.248
<i>Even with noise-cancelling
headphones,</i>

16:56.249 --> 16:58.383
<i>quiet sounds are very loud.</i>

16:58.384 --> 17:01.720
The world's built
for the neurotypical.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.722
For people like Daniel, it can
be dangerous and frightening.

17:03.723 --> 17:07.192
When Ralph's scared,
books comfort him.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.227
What-what comforts Daniel?

17:09.228 --> 17:12.197
I don't know.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.165
He likes to watch trains.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.567
The predictable rhythm of
the clickity-clack soothes him.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.802
We're right near union station.

17:17.803 --> 17:20.438
Walter: Train stations
are dangerous for any kid,

17:20.439 --> 17:24.776
let alone a boy with autism
who has difficulty
filtering information.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.145
He could get confused
and wind up on the tracks.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.047
Let's go.
Sylvester:
We could hack

17:31.250 --> 17:33.718
the station's security cameras
from here and try to find him.Uh, Jill, you can't leave.

17:35.087 --> 17:38.456
I need to find him.
I know, but with those men
out there, it's too dangerous.

17:38.457 --> 17:39.424
And, besides,
you're the expert on Daniel.

17:39.425 --> 17:42.294
Our best shot is
if you help from here.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.763
(Loud indistinct chatter)

17:48.334 --> 17:50.735
Sylvester:
The station's extra crowded
thanks to the political rally.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.471
And with 52 cameras
and 24 tracks,

17:53.472 --> 17:59.110
we will never find
Daniel in time.

17:59.111 --> 18:02.380
Sly's right. We need to narrow
the search parameters.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.215
This morning, Tim said someone's
gait is unique as a fingerprint.

18:04.216 --> 18:05.617
Ralph, can you access the
museum footage from here?

18:05.618 --> 18:08.153
And if so, how long will it be?

18:08.154 --> 18:10.188
(Beep)
Done.

18:10.189 --> 18:12.090
Happy:
I see what Paige
is suggesting.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.091
We measure
Daniel's stride

18:13.092 --> 18:15.293
by comparing it to the length
of a known object in the same frame,
like the amx next to him.

18:15.294 --> 18:17.128
Ralph:
And use the amx's length
and video frame rate

18:17.129 --> 18:19.798
to measure Daniel's speed.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.367
Sylvester: Then we run
a simple geo-mapping program over the live footage
and cross-reference.

18:22.368 --> 18:24.302
Just got to union station.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.341
There's no sign
of Daniel yet.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.308
(Loud, distorted chatter)

18:34.413 --> 18:36.481
(Trilling)
Happy:
Done.

18:36.482 --> 18:37.415
Average stride is 26.018 inches.

18:37.416 --> 18:41.820
Speed 2.937
miles per hour.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.588
Scanning for those variables
now.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.629
There. He's on track 12!

18:51.630 --> 18:53.698
Walter:
We'll get him.

18:57.903 --> 18:59.704
He boarded the train
to rosemead!

18:59.705 --> 19:02.374
Excuse me. Excuse me!

19:02.375 --> 19:03.508
Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:03.509 --> 19:06.444
Has anyone seen

19:11.150 --> 19:14.252
a 12-year-old boy,
curly blond hair, gray hoodie,

19:14.253 --> 19:16.321
plaid shirt?!

19:16.322 --> 19:17.922
(Indistinct chatter)

19:17.923 --> 19:19.357
Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.264
Hey.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.367
Sorry, sorry. Wrong kid.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.237
We don't see him.

19:33.906 --> 19:34.739
They can't find him.
Where should they be looking?

19:34.740 --> 19:35.774
He likes places that are quiet
and confined,

19:35.775 --> 19:37.842
especially when he's scared.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.411
Sly, let's go help them look.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.446
All right.

19:42.748 --> 19:45.683
(Groans)

19:47.353 --> 19:48.453
(Train hisses)

19:48.454 --> 19:49.287
Cabe?

19:49.722 --> 19:53.291
All right. We got a train

19:55.227 --> 19:57.262
We can't have a shootout.
You go close the door,

I'll take care of him.
Okay.

It's all right.
I'm homeland security.

Everything's

20:39.004 --> 20:40.972
Sly, call LAPD.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.640
Let 'em know there's a man--

20:42.641 --> 20:44.809
Caucasian,
about five-foot-eleven,

20:44.810 --> 20:47.278
wearing and army-style jacket,
currently fleeing on track 12.

20:47.279 --> 20:49.314
They got to get him.

20:49.315 --> 20:50.782
Walter, we got a kid to find.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.750
I wanted him
to have more independence.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.320
I-i thought he was ready
to go on this field trip.

20:55.321 --> 20:58.256
This is my fault.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.457
Oh, no, i-i blame
myself, too,

20:59.458 --> 21:01.493
when things go wrong with Ralph.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.495
We're just single moms

21:03.496 --> 21:06.397
doing our best
to raise special kids.

21:09.401 --> 21:10.735
She's barely functional.

21:10.736 --> 21:12.504
When you have kids, you just
worry and stress all the time. Yeah.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.572
When does that end?
Never.

21:14.573 --> 21:15.807
I could be 100,
Ralph would be 78.

21:15.808 --> 21:20.278
He'd still be my child.
I'd still worry about him.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.016
I don't get it.
He's not on the train.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.618
He must've run in
through the west-side door

21:26.619 --> 21:29.320
and immediately decided
to leave the car

21:29.321 --> 21:31.523
through the east-side door.

21:31.524 --> 21:35.793
We assumed that he
stayed on the train.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.329
It was a simple miscalculation,
and we shouldn't

21:38.330 --> 21:39.631
be making stupid mistakes
like this.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.332
We can beat ourselves up

21:41.333 --> 21:42.433
or we can figure out
where Daniel is.

21:42.434 --> 21:44.369
'Cause if s6 can

21:44.370 --> 21:45.737
track him to this station,
that means they're tracking himright now. What are you
muttering to yourself?

21:45.738 --> 21:46.971
Quiet and confined.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.873
Now, Jill said that
Daniel seeks out places that are quiet and confined.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.742
Too many people on the train.

21:50.743 --> 21:54.412
That's why he had
to get right off.

21:54.413 --> 21:56.514
He was looking for a place
that was quiet, more soothing. Guys, I g... I got to try
to get into Daniel's head space,

21:56.515 --> 21:59.384
figure out
where he went from here.

21:59.385 --> 22:00.952
Cabe:
Hey.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.353
We may have something here.
Not much to go off of,

22:02.354 --> 22:05.690
but the serial number
on this s6 gun's

22:05.691 --> 22:07.659
been dissolved.
I thought it looked strange, so I sent a photo to happy.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.860
Happy, tell 'em
what you told me.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.428
From the pattern left behind
by the chemicals, looks like they used a mix of
nitric and hydrochloric acid

22:10.429 --> 22:13.064
called aqua regia.

22:13.065 --> 22:16.401
It's been around
since the 14th century.

22:16.402 --> 22:18.369
We're looking for
a medieval bad guy?

22:18.370 --> 22:21.706
No, we're looking for a chemist,
and the FBI has short list

22:21.707 --> 22:24.776
of chemists that farm out
to the underworld.

22:24.777 --> 22:25.877
We'll follow it. Happy,
you know a lot about this stuff,

22:25.878 --> 22:27.579
so I'm gonna come pick you up.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.814
Toby:
Oh, geniuses!

22:29.815 --> 22:32.383
Quiet and confined enough
for you?

22:33.752 --> 22:36.754
Oh.

22:36.755 --> 22:38.856
Yeah, Daniel
could've

22:38.857 --> 22:40.858
slipped off the train
and then into the hatch. What's down there?.

22:40.859 --> 22:43.628
We'll find
out soon.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.597
I'm just accepting
this won't be sanitary.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.071
Okay, service tunnels.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.473
Electric cables, plumbing pipes.

22:55.474 --> 22:58.509
Not exactly cozy. How do we know
he even came down here?

22:58.510 --> 23:00.712
A-hem.

23:00.713 --> 23:04.983
Found his headphones.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.051
They found his headphones.
They're his

23:07.052 --> 23:09.120
only protection
against sensory overload.

23:09.121 --> 23:11.956
Without them,
he has nothing.

23:11.957 --> 23:13.992
No, he has us. And he's lucky
he came down here.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.159
The signal to his tablet

23:15.160 --> 23:16.828
can't be tracked
as long as he's underground.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.496
So s6 has no idea where he is.

23:18.497 --> 23:20.465
Until one of the tunnels
he followed leads him outside,and then they're
right after him immediately.

23:20.466 --> 23:22.967
So we better split up.
Pick your tunnel.

23:22.968 --> 23:24.669
No, no, no, no. No,
three people searching blindly

23:24.670 --> 23:26.504
is inefficient.
Let's think first.

23:26.505 --> 23:30.708
You're right.

23:30.709 --> 23:32.176
Daniel chose a path

23:32.177 --> 23:33.878
based on the input
he received in this spot,then followed the tunnel
that was least discomforting.

23:33.879 --> 23:35.980
Yeah, they all seem awful
and terrifying.

23:35.981 --> 23:38.082
The question is

23:38.083 --> 23:39.684
what was Daniel's perception
of these tunnels?

23:43.689 --> 23:46.591
Guys, get your phones out.
Paige,

23:46.592 --> 23:48.593
we're gonna send you
audio recordings

23:48.594 --> 23:50.094
from each of these tunnels.

23:50.095 --> 23:53.097
Then I'll walk you through
isolating the sound

23:53.098 --> 23:57.602
on my audio software

23:57.603 --> 24:00.071
and then Jill will tell us
which way Daniel went.

24:00.072 --> 24:01.139
Into the dark.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.175
Uh, wait.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.677
Perhaps we do each tunnel
together.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.812
Three recordings
of the same audio

24:07.813 --> 24:08.913
could yield a more accurate...
No time to be a scaredy-wuss.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.716
(Squish)

24:11.717 --> 24:13.217
I don't know why a bear would
use a tunnel as a rest stop,

24:13.218 --> 24:17.689
but that's what it feels like
i just stepped in.

24:17.690 --> 24:21.859
Okay, I've uploaded
the audio files.

24:21.860 --> 24:25.863
Here's Sylvester's.

24:25.864 --> 24:27.965
Sylvester: ...But that's what
it feels like I just stepped in.

24:27.966 --> 24:31.703
Okay, play it again
without sly.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.739
That means taking out
the red sound wave. Sylvester: ...But that's...
(Indistinct chatter)

24:34.740 --> 24:36.808
Voices,

24:36.809 --> 24:38.509
passengers. That should
lead to the station concourse.

24:38.510 --> 24:40.611
He wouldn't have
gone towards people.

24:40.612 --> 24:44.115
Walter:
Okay, then

24:44.116 --> 24:47.685
call up Toby's tunnel.

24:47.686 --> 24:49.120
Toby: All right,
fun facts about tunnels.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.656
Tunnel of love, 1987 Bruce
Springsteen album, tunnel vision

24:51.657 --> 24:52.824
a sight defect, the chunnel...
Sylvester: You're yammering.

24:52.825 --> 24:53.825
Who's the scaredy-wuss now?

24:53.826 --> 24:55.927
Okay, I've isolated
Toby's voice.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.729
(Whooshing sound)

24:57.730 --> 25:01.132
I'm hearing a whooshing sound.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.067
Water.

25:03.068 --> 25:05.703
Daniel would follow water.

25:05.704 --> 25:06.838
Toby's tunnel. Let's go.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.840
He can't swim

25:09.842 --> 25:11.175
or Gauge how
treacherous water could be.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.777
If he ends up
in the wrong place...
Ralph: Even if he does,

25:12.778 --> 25:13.811
he wouldn't go in immediately.

25:13.812 --> 25:14.979
But he would go in eventually

25:14.980 --> 25:16.147
Ralph?

25:16.148 --> 25:17.915
I'll work on the u-dogs.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.886
He's trying to help,
he's just...

25:24.223 --> 25:25.089
Different?

25:25.090 --> 25:25.723
I know.

25:25.724 --> 25:28.259
And thank god for it.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.161
He's been a gift to Daniel.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.597
He's the only kid at school

25:32.598 --> 25:33.231
who makes an effort with my son.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.899
Who isn't scared of him.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.033
And Daniel's told me
all about Ralph.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.902
You have a wonderful boy
who doesn't judge people

25:37.903 --> 25:39.203
who are different.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.205
Oh, well, he's-he's
spent a great deal of time

25:41.206 --> 25:43.908
with people who are different.

25:43.909 --> 25:47.612
People who might
have their challenges

25:47.613 --> 25:50.181
but, at their core,

25:50.182 --> 25:51.783
they're really gentle souls.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.618
Cabe: Freeze, dirtbag.
Happy: Move an inch
and you're ventilated.

25:53.619 --> 25:54.819
You Calvin hollowell?
Calvin the chemist?

25:54.820 --> 25:56.187
Happy:
No, he's Calvin the cobbler.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.688
The guy's holding a beaker.

25:57.689 --> 25:59.957
Shut up.

25:59.958 --> 26:03.928
Happy:
That your handiwork?

26:05.798 --> 26:06.697
Guns are not my thing.

26:06.698 --> 26:07.999
Lie to us again, and I'll figure
out the exact chemicals you used to dissolve that serial number
off that pistol,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.867
cook up a batch and
put your hand in it.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.271
Just airing out this dump.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.644
The guys who hired you to do the
gun work, where do we find them?

26:19.645 --> 26:20.678
No idea, they found me.

26:20.679 --> 26:23.915
They tell you why they
wanted the gun wiped clean?
They didn't talk much.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.016
(Through mask): And what other
work have you done for them?

26:25.017 --> 26:27.852
Dissolved the rifling on the
barrel of a sniper rifle.

26:27.853 --> 26:31.022
So it had a completely
smooth bore?

26:31.023 --> 26:33.191
Why? That ruins accuracy.
Like I care.

26:33.192 --> 26:36.761
They pay, I do it.
Get your cell.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.930
I want whatever number
they called you from last.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.299
And we're watching you.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.167
What?
This place is full of toxins.

26:45.737 --> 26:47.205
The water, do you hear it?

26:50.075 --> 26:52.677
It's not open water, thank god.

26:53.645 --> 26:55.046
It's this enclosed pipe

26:55.047 --> 26:57.982
running into this building.

26:57.983 --> 26:59.884
Sylvester
"montague's wheat ale

26:59.885 --> 27:01.819
and stout brewery."

27:01.820 --> 27:03.688
Well, it must be
their brewing water.

27:03.689 --> 27:05.823
All right, let's check it out.

27:05.824 --> 27:07.158
Daniel?
Daniel?

27:09.194 --> 27:11.963
Um, guys?

27:15.801 --> 27:17.168
Oh, boy.

27:17.169 --> 27:21.239
What do you mean he's walking
the edge of an open grain silo? Oh, my god,

27:21.240 --> 27:22.974
he's found
a vestibular playground.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.877
He likes to balance on
the edge of things.

27:25.878 --> 27:29.881
He'll run around
the edge of a pool

27:29.882 --> 27:33.885
without fear of falling because

27:33.886 --> 27:35.086
when he's trying to
keep balance his mind is calm.All right, this is good.
If he falls in, he won't drown.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.854
No, it's actually very bad.
Silo deaths are common.

27:36.855 --> 27:39.657
You fall in, the grain shifts
and you get sucked under.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.692
The weight on your lungs
pushes air out

27:41.693 --> 27:45.062
faster than water.
It's essentially a dry drowning.

27:45.063 --> 27:47.365
It happens fast.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.133
Toby: Mercenary coming off
the rafters.

27:51.236 --> 27:53.070
Oh, this is very bad news.
Okay, okay.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.241
Get away from him.

27:59.244 --> 28:01.812
Walter: It's okay, Daniel.
You're all right.

28:01.813 --> 28:03.080
Kid, just give me the tablet
and I'll leave you alone.

28:03.715 --> 28:07.285
He's gonna fall.

28:09.354 --> 28:12.023
Daniel, just give
him what he wants. It's okay.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.391
Lars:
It's all right.

28:13.392 --> 28:14.258
Come on, you can give it to me.

28:14.259 --> 28:17.728
Just give me the backpack.

28:17.729 --> 28:19.864
There you go.
There you go.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.233
Daniel!
(Yells)

28:25.203 --> 28:26.737
I'm going in. I'm going in.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.942
Walt, you jump in
without a plan,

28:30.943 --> 28:31.208
your weight just pulls you
both under.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.310
Daniel, quick,
take a deep breath.

28:32.311 --> 28:35.780
We will get you out.

28:39.384 --> 28:40.718
Healthy 12 year-old
with a full set of lungs.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.820
He's got 80 seconds.

28:42.821 --> 28:44.255
Paige, start a countdown.

28:44.256 --> 28:47.224
We need to create
a pulley system. I'll gonna go in,
you two pull us out.

28:47.225 --> 28:52.096
With the weight of the grain
pushing down on you, if we don't
yank you out properly,

28:52.097 --> 28:53.364
we sever your spinal cord.

28:53.365 --> 28:55.266
Then do it properly.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.468
Okay, we can use the
ropes from the sign,

28:57.469 --> 29:00.237
a-and the kegs
for counterweight.
Let's go!

29:00.238 --> 29:01.472
66 seconds.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.842
Most of the stress on
your shoulders and glutes,

29:04.843 --> 29:06.277
two of the larger sets of
musculature in the body.
Okay.

29:06.278 --> 29:08.379
You need to grab the kid from
behind, under the shoulders

29:08.380 --> 29:09.447
for even weight distribution.
31 seconds.

29:09.448 --> 29:13.451
Hurry!
Toby:
Get in there.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.186
In 28 seconds we pull you out,

29:15.187 --> 29:17.755
and you better be
holding Daniel when we do. Okay.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.458
He's lighter than you,

29:21.994 --> 29:23.294
he won't be at the bottom,
feel around

29:23.295 --> 29:25.997
by your knees, that's probably
where he stopped sinking.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.766
Copy that.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.134
Okay, deep breath, buddy.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.869
(Inhales deeply)

29:35.273 --> 29:36.340
They'll never get him.

29:37.909 --> 29:38.876
There's no time.

29:38.877 --> 29:39.810
Ralph: There is time.
There's 19 seconds.

29:39.811 --> 29:40.945
That's all Walter needs.

29:40.946 --> 29:44.081
We drop the kegs,

29:44.082 --> 29:44.949
there's a good
chance we maim Walter

29:44.950 --> 29:46.317
and don't get Daniel out.

29:46.318 --> 29:48.152
That's why you're gonna
push the kegs over.

29:48.153 --> 29:49.186
Paige
ten seconds.

29:49.187 --> 29:50.321
Toby
i don't see any movement.

29:50.322 --> 29:51.389
I don't feel good about this.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.890
Maybe they're out of air.
Maybe we should pull 'em up now. And what if he doesn't have
ahold of the kid yet?
Two seconds.

29:52.891 --> 29:53.991
Screw it, drop the kegs!

29:55.027 --> 29:56.827
What the hell?
The downward
pressure of the grain

29:56.828 --> 30:00.831
was more than we realized.

30:00.832 --> 30:02.867
We need a bigger counterweight.

30:02.868 --> 30:03.934
They're out of air, sly,

30:03.935 --> 30:08.072
give 'em the damn counterweight.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.241
Oh, man.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.342
(Yells)

30:13.545 --> 30:14.912
(Panting)

30:14.913 --> 30:15.813
We did it! They're out!

30:15.814 --> 30:17.515
(Jill panting, Paige chuckles)

30:18.016 --> 30:22.086
(Inhales deeply)

30:24.923 --> 30:26.424
Oh...

30:26.425 --> 30:27.191
(Coughs)

30:27.192 --> 30:29.827
It's okay, Daniel.
It's okay.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.329
(Panting)

30:31.330 --> 30:33.931
(Groaning)

30:33.932 --> 30:35.399
He's scared but unhurt.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.567
(Whimpering)

30:36.568 --> 30:38.369
Maybe these will help.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.171
I think these belong
to you, Daniel.

30:46.578 --> 30:49.847
Thank you.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.982
You're welcome.
(Door closes)

30:51.983 --> 30:54.418
LAPD's got nothing,
and homeland's coming up blank.

30:54.419 --> 31:02.419
We got mercenaries in this city

31:04.029 --> 31:08.099
and we don't know
what they're up to.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.067
All we know is they have
a tablet they're willing

31:10.068 --> 31:13.003
to kill for, and a sniper rifle
with a smoothed-out barrel.Which I've been
thinking about.

31:13.004 --> 31:15.272
Let me float a crazy theory.

31:15.273 --> 31:16.640
You wouldn't make that kind
of weapon unless you know

31:16.641 --> 31:18.309
you can get your hands on
smart bullets.

31:18.310 --> 31:21.879
How? They robbed the darpa lab?
Paige:
Something tells me

31:21.880 --> 31:23.214
I'm not going to like
smart bullets

31:23.215 --> 31:24.915
once they're explained to me.

31:24.916 --> 31:27.384
Happy:
Good assumption.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.019
They're GPS, laser-guided,
experimental and illegal.

31:29.020 --> 31:31.889
Once they lock in
on a specific point,

31:31.890 --> 31:32.990
they will reach that point,

31:32.991 --> 31:33.891
even if they have
to go around buildings,

31:33.892 --> 31:35.359
moving objects, whatever.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.028
They have their own
directional system,

31:38.029 --> 31:40.064
so they don't need rifling
in the gun they're fired from. That could be why they needed
the tablet.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.365
The tablet could have
the targeting software

31:41.366 --> 31:43.000
for the smart bullets.

31:43.001 --> 31:44.568
Look at this.

31:44.569 --> 31:48.239
Oh, thank you.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.242
He opened his mapping app.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.643
He put a pin in the jenderman
building downtown. Why?

31:52.644 --> 31:54.311
Daniel:
I opened their tablet.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.114
Ralph's trick.

31:57.115 --> 31:59.483
I showed him what you taught me.

32:02.521 --> 32:03.621
"Their" tablet, meaning s6?

32:05.624 --> 32:06.624
File had date. Today.

32:06.625 --> 32:07.625
He opened a file on their tablet
with today's date.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.026
That's where he found
the building.

32:09.027 --> 32:12.196
If they're using modified
weaponries and smart bullets,

32:12.197 --> 32:14.598
we're talking about
an assassination,

32:14.599 --> 32:16.700
and this building is where
it's gonna go down.

32:16.701 --> 32:20.471
(Tires squealing)

32:22.941 --> 32:24.575
(Grunts)

32:27.979 --> 32:30.314
(Exhales)
It's after 5:00;
It's closed for the day.

32:30.315 --> 32:32.383
I'm on the lock!

32:32.384 --> 32:34.051
Cabe:
Somewhere in this vicinity

32:34.052 --> 32:36.387
is a very specific location

32:36.388 --> 32:41.091
that can only be seen

32:41.092 --> 32:43.594
from this building

32:43.595 --> 32:44.695
through windows
and non-opaque glass.Sylvester (Over comms):
But even without a direct shot, the bullet can still pinpoint
a geographic target.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.664
The bullet will get where
it's told to go.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.732
The problem is,

32:48.733 --> 32:49.700
there's a million different
windows and locales

32:49.701 --> 32:53.971
that can be seen
from that building.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.106
And that's why
you have to get in.

32:56.107 --> 32:57.541
Happy:
Yeah, I'm going as fast
as I can.

32:57.542 --> 32:59.076
(Indistinct chatter nearby)

32:59.077 --> 33:00.744
Hey, fellas.

33:00.745 --> 33:02.179
Remember that Diaz rally
we've been dodging all day?

33:02.180 --> 33:03.581
Where is it?
Sylvester:
The one wilton building.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.015
Three blocks from where you are.

33:05.016 --> 33:06.217
I've got a live feed of it
up now.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.018
It's about to end.

33:08.019 --> 33:11.522
Meaning the candidate will be
leaving for his motorcade soon.That's the perfect time
to take him out.

33:11.523 --> 33:12.990
If he is, in fact, the target.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.692
One wilton is due east of this
building

33:14.693 --> 33:17.194
with the hidoko tower
between it.

33:17.195 --> 33:20.998
Hidoko has a clear glass atrium
which would allow the shooterto zero in on Diaz's motorcade,

33:20.999 --> 33:22.766
pull the trigger, run off

33:22.767 --> 33:24.535
without anyone knowing
where the shot came from!

33:24.536 --> 33:25.669
I'm in!

33:25.670 --> 33:31.208
Paige, you contact homeland.

33:31.209 --> 33:34.078
Tell them to reach Diaz's
security team.

33:34.079 --> 33:36.046
They cannot leave the building.

33:36.047 --> 33:37.448
I'm gonna go get this bastard.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.315
I'm coming with you.
No. You're gonna stay put.

33:38.316 --> 33:39.783
You've been
acting strange today.

33:42.153 --> 33:43.787
I think that speech
went well.

33:43.788 --> 33:45.222
(Indistinct radio chatter)

33:45.223 --> 33:47.224
Sir, I'm gonna
need you to wait here.

33:47.225 --> 33:48.492
I just received word there may
be an attempt on your life.

33:52.597 --> 33:56.100
You pull that trigger,
I'll pull mine.

33:56.101 --> 33:57.301
Guys, I have him trapped

34:02.140 --> 34:10.140
on the east side
of the tenth floor.

34:11.783 --> 34:16.554
East side of the tenth floor?

34:16.555 --> 34:18.756
From that angle,

34:18.757 --> 34:20.391
he wouldn't have a clear visual
of the motorcade.It doesn't make sense.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.129
Oh, no.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.831
Diaz isn't the target.

34:27.832 --> 34:30.200
It's much worse than that.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.073
He doesn't have an angle on the
motorcade, he's gonna take out

34:36.074 --> 34:38.108
the building's backup
propane generator.

34:38.109 --> 34:39.643
It will take out the bottom
floor of the building, and everyone in it.

34:39.644 --> 34:44.248
There's hundreds of people
at that rally.

34:44.249 --> 34:49.420
I know I said to keep him
inside, but you need

34:49.421 --> 34:51.422
to get everyone
out of that building.

34:51.423 --> 34:54.158
I know it's contradictory,
but you need to listen to me.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.859
Just take your hands
off that weapon.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.162
I see your finger so much
as move, I fire.

35:01.633 --> 35:05.202
I'm at the target.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.106
Lars (Over walkie-talkie):
I have eyes on the building.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.675
Diaz is still in the blast zone.

35:11.676 --> 35:15.879
Take the shot.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.815
Don't do it.

35:17.816 --> 35:22.453
(Gunshots)

35:22.454 --> 35:23.854
He fired;
He fired the smart bullet!

35:23.855 --> 35:25.289
Shots fired! Everybody down!
(Screaming)

35:26.391 --> 35:28.125
Blocked the bullet.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.160
We have Diaz
to thank for it.

35:30.161 --> 35:33.297
(Exhales)

35:50.148 --> 35:52.416
Cabe:
Guy I shot

35:52.417 --> 35:53.417
is willing to dish
on his s6 buddies

35:53.418 --> 35:55.285
and the people
who hired them,

35:55.286 --> 35:59.390
if prosecutors go for life
over capital punishment. It was good work.

35:59.391 --> 36:03.627
Same to you.

36:03.628 --> 36:05.295
Same to all of us.

36:05.296 --> 36:07.765
Scorpion saved a young boy,
stopped an assassination--

36:07.766 --> 36:13.170
that was a full day.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.304
Hey, good work today, kiddo.

36:15.373 --> 36:16.940
Um, yeah.
Okay, thanks.

36:19.477 --> 36:22.212
What's up with
your girl today?

36:22.213 --> 36:23.480
Happy?
What do you mean?

36:23.481 --> 36:25.816
She's weird... off.

36:25.817 --> 36:30.320
Not your usual
weird and off.

36:30.321 --> 36:34.758
Something different.

36:34.759 --> 36:36.694
Who knows?

36:36.695 --> 36:38.762
Look, I'm focused on my puzzle,

36:38.763 --> 36:40.564
so unless you can tell me who
the 50th emperor of Rome was, please be on your way.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.266
Wait. It's numerian.

36:42.267 --> 36:43.600
Oh, boy. I'm so smart.

36:43.601 --> 36:44.868
Paige:
Thank you so much and good luck
in the election.

36:44.869 --> 36:49.339
Well, that is a...
A very grateful candidate.

36:49.340 --> 36:50.507
(Phone buzzing)

36:50.508 --> 36:51.742
(Phones chiming)

36:51.743 --> 36:53.410
Look at this.

36:53.411 --> 36:55.579
More gratitude.

36:55.580 --> 36:58.949
Dear individual team members,

36:58.950 --> 37:00.317
your efforts
in support of scorpion

37:00.318 --> 37:02.352
are valued and appreciated.

37:02.353 --> 37:03.887
It is in all our best interests
that you keep up the good work.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.623
Cordially, Walter.

37:06.624 --> 37:08.425
You're all very welcome.

37:08.426 --> 37:10.260
Never been so moved.

37:10.261 --> 37:13.630
It's an improvement.

37:13.631 --> 37:16.700
(Phone buzzes)
Oh, it's Jill.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.238
Hi.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.340
Uh, guys,
Daniel wants to video chat.

37:27.378 --> 37:28.779
Okay, they're good to go.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.013
Okay, honey.
Go ahead.

37:30.014 --> 37:33.450
Hello. I want to thank you
for helping me today.

37:34.452 --> 37:38.789
For saving my life,

37:38.790 --> 37:40.624
and especially for understanding

37:40.625 --> 37:42.693
that even though it might not
look like it,

37:42.694 --> 37:44.294
there's a person and mind
inside of me.

37:44.295 --> 37:48.332
I have always felt like
an outsider,

37:48.333 --> 37:49.733
but you taught me that when
outsiders work together,

37:49.734 --> 37:51.368
anything is possible.

37:51.369 --> 37:53.971
Thank you team scorpion.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.907
Paige:
Thank you, Daniel.
Good-bye.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.313
Actually,
my text was inadequate.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.917
A more fitting
evaluation would be that

38:06.918 --> 38:09.486
you're incredible teammates...

38:09.487 --> 38:10.854
And when we work together,
anything's possible.

38:13.992 --> 38:16.693
Way to piggyback, Walt.

38:25.003 --> 38:28.038
The water still lies,
add 50.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.473
The Roman numeral for 50
is "l", so...

38:30.775 --> 38:36.780
Water plus "l"...

38:44.589 --> 38:45.789
It's you?

38:49.661 --> 38:53.664
Toby, please.

38:53.665 --> 38:59.503
Walter and happy
are not married--

39:03.575 --> 39:04.741
no way.

39:11.482 --> 39:12.382
You son of a bitch.

39:15.486 --> 39:16.753
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

39:16.754 --> 39:16.920
(Grunting)

39:16.921 --> 39:21.124
(Groaning)
I'm gonna kill you.

39:21.125 --> 39:22.726
(Grunts)
Get up here,
get up here.

39:22.727 --> 39:24.661
It was strictly
for my green card.

39:24.662 --> 39:25.896
There was nothing romantic
about it.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.431
You could have told me days ago.
I have been suffering.

39:27.432 --> 39:29.399
Your reaction is the reason
why I stayed silent.

39:29.400 --> 39:30.567
I did not see this coming.

39:30.568 --> 39:33.437
Once cabe lets me go,
i am on you like a honey badger.

39:33.438 --> 39:35.572
Stop! It was
six years ago.

39:35.573 --> 39:37.107
His visa was up.

39:37.108 --> 39:39.142
He was a friend in need.

39:39.143 --> 39:41.144
If I divorce him now,

39:42.814 --> 39:45.449
before he has citizenship,
he'll be deported.

39:45.450 --> 39:47.150
Walter's gone,
scorpion over.

39:47.151 --> 39:48.452
So you just have to wait
about two years

39:48.453 --> 39:49.953
until I get my citizenship,

39:49.954 --> 39:51.788
and then you
can get married.
Two years?

39:51.789 --> 39:53.156
Yeah. About that,
Walter...
Uh-huh.

39:53.157 --> 39:55.659
I don't want to get you
kicked out of the country,

39:55.660 --> 39:57.694
I don't want to
mess up the team,

39:57.695 --> 40:00.430
but I kind of need
that divorce now.

40:00.431 --> 40:02.132
W-w-w-wait... why the rush
all of a sudden?

40:04.102 --> 40:06.536
W-w-we-we've been waiting years.

40:06.537 --> 40:08.105
'Cause she's in love, jackass.

40:08.106 --> 40:09.773
Cabe:
Oh, man.

40:09.774 --> 40:12.576
That's not the reason.

40:12.577 --> 40:13.443
But I think I know why she was
acting so odd at the chemist's.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.414
I need to be able to marry Toby,

40:19.050 --> 40:20.417
Walter...

40:20.418 --> 40:23.420
...because I'm pregnant.
