00:15.176 --> 00:17.757
Temporal transition is complete.

00:18.672 --> 00:22.092
Navigation, probes, and
weapons are being calibrated.

00:22.093 --> 00:23.674
Cloaks are online.

00:23.675 --> 00:26.582
We are undetectable
to current technology.

00:26.713 --> 00:28.665
What is the time?

00:29.783 --> 00:31.988
Star charts are processing.

00:34.472 --> 00:38.734
The chrono date is 0028241.423.

00:38.735 --> 00:41.618
Very early 21st century.

00:41.619 --> 00:43.610
Has the target been located?

00:43.611 --> 00:45.228
Yes, lord Kang.

00:45.229 --> 00:50.359
In this era, the location
is known as New York City.

00:57.686 --> 01:00.063
So it begins.

01:12.607 --> 01:15.538
<i># our world's about to break #</i>

01:15.539 --> 01:18.940
<i># tormented and upset #</i>

01:18.941 --> 01:21.918
<i># the loss from when wake #</i>

01:21.919 --> 01:25.082
<i># with no way to go back #</i>

01:25.083 --> 01:28.156
<i># I'm standing on my own #</i>

01:28.157 --> 01:31.928
<i># but now I'm not alone #</i>

01:33.083 --> 01:37.706
<i># always we will fight as one #</i>

01:37.707 --> 01:40.153
<i># till the battle's won #</i>

01:40.154 --> 01:43.790
<i># with evil on the run #</i>

01:43.791 --> 01:46.187
<i># we never come undone #</i>

01:46.188 --> 01:50.081
<i># assemble, we are strong #</i>

01:50.082 --> 01:52.818
<i># forever fight as one #</i>

01:52.819 --> 01:56.266
<i># assemble, we are strong #</i>

01:56.267 --> 02:01.000
<i># forever fight as one #</i>

02:03.887 --> 02:05.855
What's a futurist?

02:06.110 --> 02:07.359
What do you mean?

02:08.038 --> 02:10.155
Well, the newspaper
calls you a futurist.

02:10.156 --> 02:14.029
And unless you're into Italian art,
I'm not entirely sure what that is.

02:14.030 --> 02:16.199
Mmm, how to explain?

02:16.393 --> 02:19.338
A futurist is someone who
tries to predict the future,

02:19.339 --> 02:21.567
or in my case, tries to create it.

02:21.568 --> 02:24.125
I'm inventing technology
for next century.

02:24.126 --> 02:25.608
Trying to make the world a better place.

02:25.609 --> 02:27.865
For instance, having news
an information delivered

02:27.866 --> 02:31.122
via wireless signals as
opposed to a newspaper.

02:33.610 --> 02:36.396
I like newspapers. For instance,

02:36.397 --> 02:39.429
this one has a picture
of you fighting Hydra.

02:39.482 --> 02:40.583
And even from the picture,

02:40.584 --> 02:42.946
anyone can see that you
don't know how to fight.

02:42.947 --> 02:43.932
What?

02:43.933 --> 02:47.630
There's about 20 super-villains out
there that would disagree with you.

02:47.856 --> 02:50.590
Meet me in the training
room in five minutes.

02:50.641 --> 02:52.532
We've got work to do.

02:59.785 --> 03:01.337
This is gonna be good.

03:01.338 --> 03:02.711
Yup.

03:10.539 --> 03:11.575
From what I've seen,

03:11.576 --> 03:15.084
you're fighting style is to tackle
people or to blast them.

03:15.085 --> 03:16.583
If I had to guess,

03:16.584 --> 03:19.880
I'd say that you've never been
in an actual fight in your life.

03:19.881 --> 03:21.648
- Well, I... I...
- Punch me.

03:21.649 --> 03:23.261
What? I'm not gonna...

03:23.262 --> 03:24.437
Do it.

03:31.912 --> 03:35.041
- Ow, what just happened?
- Let's try that again.

03:57.340 --> 03:59.050
My armor protects me, you know?

03:59.051 --> 04:01.476
It would have taken you down
before you even touched me.

04:01.477 --> 04:03.686
And if the suit I was wearing
couldn't handle you,

04:03.687 --> 04:05.668
I've got four more that could.

04:05.669 --> 04:07.795
You can't always count on your armor.

04:07.796 --> 04:09.584
You have to be ready for anything.

04:09.585 --> 04:11.057
That's the whole point.

04:11.058 --> 04:13.379
I'm working to know
exactly what's coming.

04:13.380 --> 04:15.551
I'll know exactly what to be ready for.

04:26.047 --> 04:29.524
These fantastic four as you call them,

04:29.525 --> 04:31.636
they are mortal heroes as well?

04:32.545 --> 04:35.104
Uh, they're more like explorers.

04:35.105 --> 04:38.574
I think Reed said they were heading
off to the earth's core today.

04:38.835 --> 04:40.707
This isn't fair.

04:40.823 --> 04:43.423
None of you could have taken me alone.

04:43.424 --> 04:45.053
Man, you are a whiner.

04:45.054 --> 04:47.914
You've been complaining ever
since we caught you, Blizzard.

04:48.206 --> 04:50.534
Which was really easy, by the way.

04:51.001 --> 04:52.931
Where are you taking me?

04:54.692 --> 04:56.369
What is this place?

04:56.370 --> 05:00.152
It's, uh... well, honestly I'm not sure.

05:00.153 --> 05:01.631
I haven't seen it yet.

05:01.908 --> 05:05.319
Well, iron man, Reed Richards and
I had a meeting after the breakout.

05:05.320 --> 05:08.501
We brainstormed ideas to
make the world a better place.

05:08.502 --> 05:11.162
This was number 42.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.319
Truthfully, friend Pym,

05:15.320 --> 05:18.045
I do not think this will hold anybody.

05:44.646 --> 05:46.622
<i>Greetings, Dr. Pym.</i>

05:46.717 --> 05:49.537
Good morning, Ultron 5.
We have a new guest for you.

05:49.538 --> 05:52.406
This is Blizzard, he's awaiting trail.

05:52.674 --> 05:56.158
<i>Greetings, mister Gill, aka Blizzard.</i>

05:56.159 --> 05:58.063
<i>May I call you Donald?</i>

05:58.064 --> 05:59.769
What? No.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.005
What are you...

06:16.186 --> 06:18.359
Oh, wow.

06:21.296 --> 06:25.450
Did I mention that I
was really, really sorry?

06:33.838 --> 06:37.846
Well, I appreciate the
lessons and the bruises,

06:37.847 --> 06:39.821
but the world has changed, cap.

06:39.822 --> 06:41.890
Life moves faster now than ever,

06:41.891 --> 06:44.195
and it's only gonna get faster still.

06:44.196 --> 06:48.287
I'm wired in to a worldwide
network of computers and satellites.

06:48.288 --> 06:51.378
The goal is to see danger
before it gets here.

06:51.379 --> 06:53.022
I'm getting ready for the future,

06:53.023 --> 06:55.745
and working to get
humanity there in one piece.

06:55.746 --> 06:58.286
You're still used to the
old ways of doing things.

06:58.287 --> 07:01.635
They say those who forget
history are doomed to repeat it.

07:01.704 --> 07:04.839
If the old ways include
training and preparation,

07:04.840 --> 07:06.796
then maybe you need to slow down a bit.

07:06.797 --> 07:09.195
Uh, slow, uh, down?

07:09.196 --> 07:11.971
I hear you talking, but
the words don't make sense.

07:11.972 --> 07:14.477
It's always a good idea
to know some basics.

07:14.478 --> 07:17.770
No matter what year it is,
some things never change.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.366
Huh?

07:31.031 --> 07:33.504
Greetings, avengers.

07:37.067 --> 07:39.162
I am Kang.

07:41.314 --> 07:46.642
I have come from your future to
deliver a message to Captain America.

07:55.325 --> 07:57.941
Jarvis, initiate mansion defenses.

08:36.033 --> 08:39.135
I don't care who you are, this ends now.

08:43.025 --> 08:45.347
Okay, now I care who are.

08:45.348 --> 08:48.557
You're armor is amusing.

08:48.558 --> 08:50.638
Primitive, but amusing.

08:54.437 --> 08:57.211
Now, where were we?

08:57.212 --> 08:59.353
What realm be this?

08:59.359 --> 09:01.949
We went over this
at the mansion, Thor, remember?

09:01.950 --> 09:03.310
The Negative Zone?

09:03.311 --> 09:06.049
It's a universe comprised
completely of anti-matter.

09:06.050 --> 09:08.825
By placing the super-villain
prison in the Negative Zone,

09:08.826 --> 09:10.985
even if there is another
mysterious breakout.

09:10.986 --> 09:12.887
There's no where to break out to.

09:14.789 --> 09:18.432
And what of these metal, uh, things?

09:18.433 --> 09:19.968
They are the jailers?

09:19.969 --> 09:23.721
Yes. Ultron is a robot that
iron man and I designed together.

09:23.722 --> 09:25.517
I've been mass producing
them since the breakout

09:25.518 --> 09:27.288
to act as wardens to 42.

09:27.289 --> 09:29.848
<i>How are you feeling today, Jerome?</i>

09:31.591 --> 09:33.873
Ultron can't be hurt,
he can't be corrupted,

09:33.874 --> 09:37.207
and I've programmed them
to help rehabilitate the prisoners.

09:37.208 --> 09:38.765
Pretty great, right?

09:41.011 --> 09:43.398
That's a lot of Ultrons.

09:43.399 --> 09:45.598
Hmm?

09:46.999 --> 09:51.443
I think we should get
back to earth... right now.

10:07.515 --> 10:11.253
Jarvis, give me full analysis
of Kang's armor and weapons.

10:11.254 --> 10:12.518
<i>Unable to analyze.</i>

10:12.519 --> 10:15.140
<i>The alloys are impenetrable
by armor systems.</i>

10:15.141 --> 10:17.479
What? What about his chair?

10:21.357 --> 10:24.645
<i>Error. No matching
technology on file.</i>

10:25.046 --> 10:27.344
<i>Extrapolating... error.</i>

10:27.345 --> 10:30.601
<i>Unable to comprehend given
current level of technology.</i>

10:36.893 --> 10:38.156
Who are you?

10:38.332 --> 10:40.470
Why are you attacking the avengers?

10:40.471 --> 10:43.632
Oh, not the avengers, Captain. You.

10:44.462 --> 10:46.091
As for your questions,

10:46.092 --> 10:49.321
I am Kang the conqueror.

10:49.322 --> 10:51.850
I have come from the 41st century,

10:51.851 --> 10:56.636
traveling to this backwater time
period for one simple reason.

10:57.174 --> 11:00.712
To eliminate you from the timeline.

11:07.926 --> 11:10.351
Jarvis, full power to uni-beam.

11:13.614 --> 11:15.607
That's not possible.

11:15.608 --> 11:16.875
Stay focused.

11:16.876 --> 11:19.169
Kang, you say you're from the future,

11:19.170 --> 11:21.737
why would you want to
take out Captain America?

11:22.708 --> 11:24.901
To save the world.

11:36.302 --> 11:38.601
Now, this is just some friendly advice,

11:38.602 --> 11:40.776
I'd stay down if I were you.

11:49.546 --> 11:50.531
Hulk, wait.

11:50.532 --> 11:51.710
We need answers.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.096
What did you mean by
save the world, Kang?

11:54.097 --> 11:57.495
In my time, I rule all.

11:57.496 --> 12:02.994
But a disruption in the space-time
continuum destroyed my reality,

12:02.995 --> 12:05.627
wiping everything from existence.

12:05.628 --> 12:10.438
I traced the cause of the disruption
to an anomaly in the time stream.

12:10.439 --> 12:14.544
Something that should not have
existed in the 21st century.

12:14.659 --> 12:17.041
Captain America.

12:19.965 --> 12:22.037
Huh?

12:30.237 --> 12:35.066
Your actions in this era have
destroyed my empire, Captain.

12:35.067 --> 12:39.224
Ending your life is the
first step in restoring it.

12:51.317 --> 12:53.586
You wish to end a life, villain?

12:53.587 --> 12:55.017
Then try ours.

12:55.018 --> 12:56.057
Yeah.

12:56.378 --> 12:57.734
Wait, what?

13:11.158 --> 13:12.674
Give it up, Kang.

13:12.852 --> 13:17.160
Kang does not give up, primitive.

13:17.507 --> 13:20.869
If you insist on fighting
for the Captain's life,

13:20.870 --> 13:25.800
then I will show you fools
exactly what you are fighting for.

13:39.329 --> 13:40.450
No.

13:47.105 --> 13:50.360
This is what Captain America's presents

13:50.361 --> 13:52.775
in your time has caused.

13:52.776 --> 13:55.784
This is all his fault.

14:06.818 --> 14:08.688
Where have you taken us, Kang?

14:08.689 --> 14:11.486
Not where, avenger, when.

14:11.839 --> 14:14.180
You stand in your New York City,

14:14.181 --> 14:16.549
just 10 years from your present day.

14:16.550 --> 14:18.053
You did this.

14:18.115 --> 14:20.423
You are not listening, archer.

14:20.424 --> 14:23.287
I am not responsible for
destroying your world.

14:23.288 --> 14:25.591
Captain America is.

14:25.592 --> 14:27.333
Everyone just... just wait.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.778
Jarvis, connect to the
Stark Industries' network.

14:29.779 --> 14:30.953
<i>Network not found.</i>

14:30.954 --> 14:33.000
Try shield. Try everything.

14:33.001 --> 14:35.413
<i>Error. No networks found.</i>

14:35.414 --> 14:38.223
There's nothing out there.

14:44.265 --> 14:45.694
There's no one left.

14:45.695 --> 14:47.427
Of course not.

14:47.428 --> 14:52.918
You see, very soon in your timeline,
earth will be consumed in a war.

14:52.919 --> 14:55.859
Earth's sun will be a
casualty in that war,

14:55.860 --> 14:58.561
along with all life on the planet.

14:58.562 --> 15:00.489
What kind of war could do that?

15:00.490 --> 15:05.714
A war between two alien empires,
the Kree and the Skrulls.

15:07.148 --> 15:08.683
But in the end,

15:08.684 --> 15:12.570
it was Captain America
that was truly responsible.

15:12.571 --> 15:15.264
Nay. You lie, conqueror.

15:15.265 --> 15:18.576
No one man could be responsible
for such destruction,

15:18.577 --> 15:20.313
least of all Captain America.

15:20.314 --> 15:22.144
Not knowingly.

15:22.145 --> 15:25.247
But the Captain should
not exist in your time.

15:25.248 --> 15:26.867
He should not have lived.

15:26.868 --> 15:29.511
I am here to correct this.

15:29.512 --> 15:30.733
Let me get this straight.

15:30.734 --> 15:33.655
Handing over cap to you
is gonna save the world?

15:33.656 --> 15:36.376
Stupid future man.

15:46.664 --> 15:47.917
It may.

15:47.918 --> 15:50.762
I came to eliminate Captain America.

15:50.763 --> 15:52.839
But just to be sure,
I am going to advance

15:52.840 --> 15:55.304
the planet's technology in your time.

15:55.305 --> 15:59.526
I will ready your military
and prepare for the coming war.

15:59.705 --> 16:03.311
Earth will be able to
repulse the alien forces.

16:03.312 --> 16:05.567
And how do you plan
to accomplish all this?

16:05.568 --> 16:08.555
By conquering your world.

16:08.609 --> 16:10.846
I tell you as a courtesy.

16:10.913 --> 16:15.505
This is going to happen.
Hand over Captain America,

16:15.506 --> 16:19.509
stay out of my way or face my wrath.

16:19.510 --> 16:22.275
If I really am responsible for all this,

16:22.276 --> 16:24.080
I have to stand down.

16:24.081 --> 16:25.895
There's too much at stake.

16:26.166 --> 16:30.380
But the rest of the world,
it's your decision, Tony.

16:30.381 --> 16:32.513
You're the futurist, after all.

16:32.514 --> 16:34.502
Tony, you can't possibly...

16:34.503 --> 16:36.373
We know the Kree are coming.

16:36.374 --> 16:37.621
We already met them.

16:37.622 --> 16:41.759
Kang's got technology more advanced
than anything I ever dreamed of.

16:41.815 --> 16:44.065
He could be the world's only hope.

16:44.996 --> 16:47.357
But he's being a real jerk about it.

16:47.731 --> 16:49.688
Avengers, take him.

17:08.127 --> 17:11.933
I hope you enjoy the rest of
your days on this dead earth

17:11.934 --> 17:15.178
for this is where I'm leaving you.

17:15.946 --> 17:16.782
Huh?

17:18.830 --> 17:20.773
Okay, I'm impressed.

17:20.775 --> 17:22.688
I sensed them the second we got here.

17:22.689 --> 17:25.329
Cockroaches can survive anything.

17:44.537 --> 17:46.257
Iron man, get to the chair.

17:46.258 --> 17:47.898
That's our ticket home.

17:49.079 --> 17:52.061
- What? But I can't...
- You're the only one who can.

18:24.240 --> 18:28.337
You really hope to defeat
me by throwing rocks at me,

18:28.338 --> 18:30.510
you mindless monster?

18:30.511 --> 18:33.774
It's called a distraction, smart guy.

18:46.909 --> 18:49.370
<i>Unable to analyze. Error.</i>

18:49.371 --> 18:50.575
Argh, come on!

18:50.576 --> 18:52.649
This isn't magic. It's technology.

18:52.650 --> 18:54.433
There has to be logic to it.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.640
Yield!

19:02.933 --> 19:05.643
You dare?

19:53.499 --> 19:55.325
We're running out of time, Tony.

19:55.326 --> 19:56.563
Come on, come on.

19:56.564 --> 19:57.777
I don't understand.

19:57.778 --> 20:00.252
I can't do it. There's just no way to...

20:01.652 --> 20:06.302
Jarvis, stop. Connect
to port 290926 now.

20:15.068 --> 20:16.114
No.

20:16.332 --> 20:18.573
A very smart man told me once

20:18.574 --> 20:21.642
that those who forget the
past are doomed to repeat it.

20:21.643 --> 20:24.056
Your tech is incredibly advanced, Kang,

20:24.057 --> 20:29.027
but some of its physical systems are
based on very, very old technology.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.191
Stark industries technology.

20:31.192 --> 20:33.772
Activate time circuits, now.

20:41.004 --> 20:43.293
You will pay for this.

21:06.118 --> 21:09.057
This is not over.

21:09.612 --> 21:12.904
Cap and I don't agree on
a lot, but on this we do.

21:12.905 --> 21:13.847
It's over.

21:13.848 --> 21:16.535
Damocles, recall, now.

21:21.150 --> 21:23.331
- Good work, soldier.
- Thanks.

21:23.332 --> 21:25.072
You know he'll be back, right?

21:25.073 --> 21:26.541
That's the problem with the future.

21:26.542 --> 21:28.729
It's always there waiting for you.

21:37.924 --> 21:39.864
Did the natives surrender?

21:39.865 --> 21:42.162
They did not.

21:42.269 --> 21:44.880
Time to show the 21st century

21:44.881 --> 21:48.841
how I earned the title of conqueror.

21:49.305 --> 21:55.425
