Nope.

19:45.938 --> 19:47.437
Well, when I decided
to track you down

19:47.439 --> 19:49.342
I reached out to some
of the guys from school.

You remember Dodie,
the relentless one?

19:53.112 --> 19:55.444

19:55.446 --> 19:58.216

show were you and me.

Nobody knew where you were.

20:02.288 --> 20:06.025
Everybody knew about
Iraq and the medals.

20:08.227 --> 20:10.559
So little Greg had gone
fishing on this boat

20:10.561 --> 20:14.030
on some island in the middle
of nowhere and he had caught

20:14.032 --> 20:17.468
a fish and had his photo
taken with it and he said

20:17.470 --> 20:19.603
that there was this
guy in the shot

20:19.605 --> 20:21.203
who looked just like John Mason.

20:21.205 --> 20:26.311
Only he said the guy was
calling himself Baker Dill.

20:27.145 --> 20:28.446
Was it a big fish?

20:28.448 --> 20:29.813
Excuse me?

20:29.815 --> 20:32.418
He had his photo taken, it
must have been a big fish.

20:34.286 --> 20:36.086
So we tracked down the photo.

20:36.088 --> 20:38.154
Couldn't tell if it was you
standing there or not but

20:38.156 --> 20:39.924
the name gave it
away, Baker Dill.

20:40.726 --> 20:43.626
Dillon Baker was the only
teacher you respected at Morgan.

20:43.628 --> 20:45.261
He taught math, right?

20:45.263 --> 20:48.567

told me what you want.

The fundamental process.

The rule is you've got to
catch a particular fish.

That rule is your compulsion
and your compulsion

01:03:50.679 --> 01:03:52.148

But now it seems the fish
is no longer the point.

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.190

you kill a man.

Yeah.

01:33:40.935 --> 01:33:44.039

acted in self-defence

01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:16.030

as a gifted IT student living
in a troubled environment

01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:34.079
