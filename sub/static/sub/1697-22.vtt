00:43.700 --> 00:47.090
Are you guys serious?
He trashes practically everybody.

00:47.180 --> 00:51.930

Daddy, there is no way l'm letting
Barney Bittman review my concert.

03:02.060 --> 03:04.120
Can't l just have the flu?

03:06.010 --> 03:09.080
Mile, why are you letting this guy
get to you?

03:09.160 --> 03:10.720
What's the worst thing he can say?

03:10.800 --> 03:12.230
Well, how about,

03:12.320 --> 03:17.230
''Hannah Montana, what did
that poor state ever do to you?''

03:22.420 --> 03:25.060
You know, that sounds exactly
like something he would say.

03:25.140 --> 03:27.730
-Miley's right...
-Where?

03:29.490 --> 03:32.850
-And it would be terrible.
-lt'd be just awful.

03:32.930 --> 03:36.440
And, honey, it wouldn't matter.
You said yourself, the guy's a jerk.

03:36.520 --> 03:40.640
Yeah, but he's a jerk
who knows good music.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.830
And if he doesn't like me,
then maybe l'm no better than Mikayla.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.460
Miley Stewart, you don't believe
that any more than l believe

03:48.550 --> 03:53.330
calling a snail ''escargot'' is gonna
stop it from tasting like a salty loogie.

03:54.780 --> 03:57.650
You know, as gross as that sounds,
l have to agree.

03:57.730 --> 04:01.560
He's right. Miley, you're way better
than a salty loogie.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.360
Fine. l'll do the concert.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.910
But if Barney Bittman's
going to be there,

04:09.990 --> 04:12.980
this has got to be the best show
l have ever done.

04:13.070 --> 04:16.769
All week l am going to rehearse.
No distractions, no interruptions...

04:16.860 --> 04:18.610
Surprise, surprise!

04:21.019 --> 04:22.340
-Uncle Earl!
-Earl!

04:22.420 --> 04:25.850
l ran over this in Texas.
Who wants to grill it up?

04:27.130 --> 04:28.720
Sweet niblets.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.910
Whoo doggies. Look at this place.

04:35.990 --> 04:38.580
You folks sure live high on the hog.

04:39.510 --> 04:41.300
Speaking of hogs,

04:42.980 --> 04:45.370
l can't believe you brought Cuddles.

04:45.460 --> 04:47.410
Well, l needed someone
to keep me company.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.370
lt was either him or Aunt Pearl.

04:49.450 --> 04:53.330
And this one doesn't need
to stop every 20 minutes to tinkle.

04:55.010 --> 04:58.790
-Hey, Uncle Earl, what's this?
-That's Cuddles' tinkle box.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.040
You are such a wimp.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.420
-Take it back, take it back. Take it.
-Stop it! lt's getting on me!

05:04.510 --> 05:07.740
lt's getting...
lt's seeping through my clothes.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.850
Daddy, you know l love Uncle Earl,

05:13.940 --> 05:16.970
but how am l going to focus
on my concert with him here?

05:17.570 --> 05:19.160
Mile, l wouldn't even worry about it.

05:19.250 --> 05:22.360
lf l know Earl, all he's going to want
to do is run around Hollywood

05:22.450 --> 05:26.560
with a map of the stars' homes
and play Celebrity Ding Dong Ditch.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.310
Like you did
when we first moved here?

05:29.390 --> 05:31.700
Good times, good times. Yeah.

05:35.410 --> 05:38.440
So, Earl, what do you want to do first?

05:38.520 --> 05:43.070
v enice Beach, Hollywood Sign,
maybe play a little Ding Dong Ditch?

05:45.070 --> 05:49.220
That sounds tempting,
but l'm out here on a mission.

05:50.780 --> 05:55.450
l'm gonna be a rock star.

05:56.850 --> 05:58.290
-What?
-What?

05:59.410 --> 06:01.320
l know it sounds crazy.

06:01.410 --> 06:03.760
But Robby Ray,
you followed your dream.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.270
l always kick myself
for giving up on mine.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.000
l mean, look at us.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.430
Remember when l was the hot one?

06:12.310 --> 06:14.700
-He was the hot one?
-No, it's true.

06:14.790 --> 06:18.170
Uncle Earl was the prom king
and Dad had a unibrow.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.980
Sexiest unibrow in Buford County.

06:23.140 --> 06:25.770
You know,
all these years l've wondered

06:25.850 --> 06:29.000
what would have happened
if l'd stayed with my music.

06:29.090 --> 06:33.870
Would l have a little bit more of this?
Maybe just a little bit less of this?

06:34.640 --> 06:38.260
Well, now with the help
of Hannie Montanie,

06:38.350 --> 06:40.390
l'm gonna know for sure.

06:41.870 --> 06:45.460
''Uncle who showed up
at the worst time possible,'' say what?

06:45.540 --> 06:46.770
l know what you're thinking.

06:46.860 --> 06:49.420
This unc can't bring the funk.

06:50.050 --> 06:52.640
Well, get ready to scream like a girl

06:52.730 --> 06:56.920
when you feel the power of Uncle Earl.

07:20.290 --> 07:21.770
Well, what'd you think?

07:21.850 --> 07:25.150
-l think l lost a filling.
-Me, too.

07:25.720 --> 07:28.440
-l'll drive you to the dentist.
-Okay.

07:30.190 --> 07:31.590
Be honest.

07:32.830 --> 07:35.060
l can honestly say

07:36.630 --> 07:40.690
l've never heard anything like it before.

07:42.580 --> 07:45.690
And l may never hear
anything ever again

07:47.250 --> 07:48.650
like that,

07:48.730 --> 07:50.680
because it was special.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.110
So you'll help me?

07:53.200 --> 07:56.390
A talent like yours
just screams ''help me,'' Earl.

07:57.270 --> 07:59.830
l knew my kin would be there for me.

08:01.390 --> 08:03.140
There's just one little problem.

08:03.230 --> 08:05.450
You see,
l have this concert on Saturday

08:05.540 --> 08:07.490
and this major critic is coming,

08:07.580 --> 08:10.130
so l'm going to be
rehearsing every minute,

08:10.210 --> 08:12.040
-so l don't...
-That's no problem.

08:12.130 --> 08:13.640
That's perfect!

08:13.730 --> 08:15.920
What better way for me
to learn how to be a rock star

08:16.010 --> 08:18.150
than to follow you around?

08:19.760 --> 08:22.910
You won't even know l'm there.
Just a little fly on the wall.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.300
<i>Just a little fly on the wal</i> l

08:29.990 --> 08:33.210
l'm going to be needing
a really big fly swatter.

08:36.419 --> 08:38.049
<i>l am a rock sta</i> r

08:44.880 --> 08:46.160
<i>Yea</i> h

08:46.240 --> 08:47.990
That was awesome.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.710
That was awesome. Great job, guys.

08:50.790 --> 08:53.260
l can already hear
Barney Bittman saying,

08:53.350 --> 08:57.260
''What a band, what a girl,
what a show.''

08:59.460 --> 09:02.290
All right, now let's kick some butt
on <i>Nobody's Perfec</i> t

09:02.380 --> 09:04.930
and call it a great day. Let's go.

09:08.370 --> 09:10.480
<i>Everybody makes mistake</i> s

09:13.840 --> 09:15.910

09:29.940 --> 09:31.730
<i>Everybody..</i>.

09:34.910 --> 09:38.100
Uncle Earl, what are you doing?

09:38.180 --> 09:41.490
-Watching your rock star moves.
-Gee, thanks.

09:43.580 --> 09:45.930
Earl! Dang flabbit. There you are.

09:46.010 --> 09:47.440
Come on, Robby Ray.

09:47.530 --> 09:51.040
l done seen the lighting booth,
the sound booth, the dressing room.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.590
l just want to watch one song
real close up, please?

09:56.760 --> 09:59.550
Now, Earl, that puppy dog face
used to work when we were kids,

09:59.630 --> 10:01.430
but l'm a man now.

10:03.630 --> 10:07.300
What the heck, Miley?
One song won't hurt, will it?

10:07.380 --> 10:10.130
Thank you, O Man of Steel.

10:12.010 --> 10:13.160
Okay.

10:15.290 --> 10:19.960
You can watch one song, but, please,
just don't get in the way.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.230
l won't. Fly on the wall.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.430
You won't even know l'm here.
Won't even know l'm here. Not here.

10:25.510 --> 10:26.580
Look out, Uncle Earl.

10:29.150 --> 10:32.660
Earl, you clumsy dang clodhopper!
Sorry, young fellow.

10:34.420 --> 10:36.570
lt's cool. lt was an accident.

10:36.660 --> 10:39.640
-Are you hurt, son?
-l think l broke my hand.

10:40.570 --> 10:42.880
But you can still play, right?

10:42.970 --> 10:44.120
No.

10:44.210 --> 10:47.190
But l'm sorry,
l mean, it's just so important.

10:47.280 --> 10:51.060
Don't worry, kiddo.
l caused this problem, l'm gonna fix it.

10:51.670 --> 10:53.870
l don't like where this is going.

10:53.950 --> 10:59.060
Hannie Montanie, say howdy
to your brand-new guitar player.

10:59.140 --> 11:03.050
<i>Everybody makes mistake</i> s
<i>Everybody has them day</i> s

11:04.690 --> 11:07.650
Are you sure
you can't play with your feet?

11:19.390 --> 11:21.700
Daddy, what am l going to do?

11:21.790 --> 11:25.410
As soon as Barney Bittman
sees me on stage with Uncle Earl,

11:25.500 --> 11:27.890
he'll rip me worse than Mikayla.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.890
Maybe Earl won't be that bad.

11:29.980 --> 11:34.570
<i>l'm gonna be a rock star</i>!
<i>l'm gonna be a rock star</i>!

11:34.650 --> 11:36.880
He's doing a jig with a pig.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.840
l'll go talk to him.

11:43.040 --> 11:46.260
Perfect. Dad will talk to him,
he'll understand

11:46.350 --> 11:48.580
and everything will be okay.

11:55.780 --> 11:58.240
So, who wants pie?

12:00.130 --> 12:01.530
You caved, didn't you?

12:01.610 --> 12:06.120
l'm sorry, honey, but he looked at me
with that puppy dog face.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.510
l've got a puppy dog face, too.

12:14.550 --> 12:16.580
No, Earl's got you beat.

12:17.350 --> 12:20.060
Fine. l'll go talk to him.

12:21.380 --> 12:25.570
l can't believe it, Pearl.
Miley's making my dream come true.

12:25.650 --> 12:27.480
l feel like Sanjaya,

12:28.170 --> 12:30.040
you know, in the early rounds.

12:30.130 --> 12:31.880
And you know what?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.840
Ever since l found out
l was in the band,

12:34.920 --> 12:36.870
l'm not hungry all the time.

12:36.960 --> 12:40.700
lt's like l was eating
to fill the emptiness,

12:40.790 --> 12:44.460
and now my guts are filled with love.

12:44.550 --> 12:46.930
And it's all because of Miley.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.610
So how did it go?

12:56.050 --> 12:58.600
He said l filled his guts with love.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.990
Well, this is quite the dilemma.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.590
You can't keep Uncle Earl away
from the critic,

13:05.670 --> 13:09.630
and you still haven't figured out how
to keep the critic away from Uncle Earl.

13:09.710 --> 13:12.380
What to do, what to do?

13:14.420 --> 13:15.570
What's it going to cost me?

13:15.660 --> 13:17.290
A hundred bucks
and Cuddles sleeps in your room.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.130
-Fine.
-And you clean the tinkle box.

13:19.210 --> 13:21.120
Yours or the pig's?

13:21.970 --> 13:23.880
Don't push it.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.190
Now all you have to do
is get Barney to leave the concert

13:26.280 --> 13:28.870
to go to a party at Ozzy Osbourne's.

13:28.960 --> 13:32.630
Perfect plan...
lf l knew Ozzy Osbourne!

13:35.470 --> 13:38.380
Well, you do now, love.

13:38.460 --> 13:40.180
Sharon!

13:46.650 --> 13:48.530
Hannah, this place is packed,

13:48.610 --> 13:50.760
and l can see Barney Bittman
in the balcony.

13:50.850 --> 13:52.640
Does he look happy?

13:53.760 --> 13:57.430
Catch of the day? What day?
Last Thursday?

13:59.030 --> 14:00.470
Not really.

14:01.310 --> 14:05.620
Miley, the show's going to start
in five minutes! Where's Uncle Earl?

14:05.700 --> 14:07.370
Maybe he got stage fright!

14:07.460 --> 14:09.490
You know, deep down,
he really is very shy.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.490
Check out your funky uncle!

14:11.570 --> 14:15.250
l'm a rock star!

14:17.970 --> 14:21.510
Okay, Funkle Earl,

14:22.040 --> 14:25.580
l love the whole flaming head thing
you got going on.

14:25.670 --> 14:28.100
Just, can we bring it down a notch?

14:28.190 --> 14:30.460
Or more? A lot?

14:31.270 --> 14:34.730
Whatever you're comfortable with.
A lot would be good.

14:35.740 --> 14:39.770
Sorry, it's hard to take it down
on the greatest night of my life!

14:39.850 --> 14:44.440
l mean, look at me! l'm so excited
l'm sweating my flames off!

14:46.160 --> 14:50.510
Well, then let's go get you a towel.
And maybe a big hat.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.550
Or whatever you're comfortable with.
A big hat would be good.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.490
Well, l guess it's all up to Jackson now.

15:02.140 --> 15:03.650
Pray with me.

15:07.770 --> 15:09.170
Barney!

15:09.730 --> 15:12.520
-Barney, you cheeky monkey.
-Ozzy!

15:12.600 --> 15:14.480
Come give Ozzy some love.

15:14.560 --> 15:15.880
Ozzy!

15:17.020 --> 15:18.930
You look terrible.

15:19.010 --> 15:21.570
What are you doing
at a Hannah Montana concert?

15:21.650 --> 15:23.920
ls that where l am?

15:24.010 --> 15:26.880
l thought l was getting a taco.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.870
Listen. Listen. Listen.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.550
l'm listening!

15:34.910 --> 15:37.700
-Well?
-You didn't say anything.

15:38.790 --> 15:39.820
Right.

15:39.900 --> 15:44.290
There's a party at my house. Come on!

15:45.540 --> 15:48.970
Wait a minute,
l have to review Hannah Montana.

15:49.050 --> 15:53.000
But Sharon's making...

15:53.080 --> 15:56.120
Avocados all mashed together.
lt's very good.

15:57.360 --> 16:01.190
Okay, l'll go with you,
but just one question.

16:02.430 --> 16:04.820
How stupid do you think l am?

16:06.100 --> 16:07.850
l was hoping, a lot.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.250
Enjoy the show!

16:13.010 --> 16:15.080
-Jackson's plan is gonna work.
-Jackson's plan is gonna work.

16:15.170 --> 16:17.320
-Jackson's plan is gonna work.
-Jackson's plan is gonna work.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.840
Great news. My plan worked.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.560
-lt did?
-lt did?

16:21.640 --> 16:25.600
Yep. Bittman's on his way to Ozzy's
right now, so just go out there,

16:25.680 --> 16:28.470
have a great concert
and don't worry about a thing.

16:28.550 --> 16:29.820
-You're lying.
-How did you know?

16:29.910 --> 16:31.740
Your lips are moving.

16:32.540 --> 16:34.450
l'm sorry. l tried.

16:36.540 --> 16:39.250
Y'all saw what
Barney Bittman did to Mikayla.

16:39.330 --> 16:42.160
Think about what's going to happen
to me when he sees me on stage

16:42.250 --> 16:44.760
with the Earl of Embarrassment?

16:46.800 --> 16:49.030
l'm an embarrassment to you?

16:51.240 --> 16:52.710
-My tooth!
-Mine, too. lt hurts.

16:52.790 --> 16:55.350
-Okay. Be right back.
-Nice flames.

16:57.670 --> 16:58.660
Uncle Earl, l...

16:58.750 --> 17:02.420
Earl, l found you a hat.
lt's a big one, too.

17:04.060 --> 17:06.520
You don't want me to play with you,
do you?

17:06.609 --> 17:07.970
Oh, boy.

17:08.450 --> 17:10.680
No, l don't.

17:11.730 --> 17:14.000
Earl, this is my fault.

17:14.079 --> 17:17.960
l should've been honest with you
from the get-go. We love you, it's just...

17:18.040 --> 17:20.790
lt's just this show,
it's so important and...

17:20.869 --> 17:23.150
-And you're so...
-Stupid.

17:23.869 --> 17:26.980
Come on now, Earl.
l mean, you don't have to...

17:28.500 --> 17:31.570
What was l thinking,
trying to be a rock star?

17:31.660 --> 17:35.850
l was born a loser.
l'm always going to be a loser.

17:35.930 --> 17:39.470
l'm the most embarrassing
dang doofus in this whole family.

17:39.560 --> 17:43.350
Worst than Unlucky Bucky,
or Wacky Wilbur, or even Jackson.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.540
Hey.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.620
Good grief, boy,
look what you're wearing.

17:48.710 --> 17:51.220
<i>And now</i>,
<i>the legendary Tower of Blue</i> s

17:51.310 --> 17:54.260
<i>is proud to present Hannah Montana</i>!

17:55.540 --> 17:56.580
Uncle Earl...

17:56.660 --> 18:00.360
That's all right.
Robby can play the guitar parts.

18:00.450 --> 18:02.570
He's got the hair for it.

18:04.010 --> 18:07.360
l'm sorry, Earl.
Come on, darling, it's show time.

18:13.990 --> 18:16.380
<i>Oh, yea</i> h

18:17.510 --> 18:20.970
<i>How you doing, Tower of Blues</i> ?
<i>Are you ready to rock</i> ?

18:27.330 --> 18:30.240
Keep playing, Daddy. l'll be right back.

18:36.580 --> 18:39.250
Come on, guitar man.
Drop your snack, you're in the act.

18:39.340 --> 18:40.370
What?

18:40.450 --> 18:43.090
Yeah, come on.
l need my funky uncky on stage.

18:43.170 --> 18:46.790
l thought you was worried
about that big-time critic.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.520
l was, but l was wrong.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.060
The truth is,
l don't care what anybody thinks.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.830
Everyone deserves a chance
to live their dream,

18:54.910 --> 18:56.740
and yours is waiting for you
on that stage.

18:56.830 --> 18:59.820
So, come on,
l don't have time to argue.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.650
Wait for me!

19:04.780 --> 19:06.840
<i>Now we're ready to rock</i>!

19:09.130 --> 19:12.960
<i>Sometimes l walk a little faste</i> r

19:48.950 --> 19:50.900
<i>Hit it, Uncle Earl</i>!

20:20.780 --> 20:22.260
Can't sleep?

20:22.340 --> 20:23.820
How'd you know l was out here?

20:23.900 --> 20:26.570
This is where l came after
my first concert.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.290
Pretty pumped, aren't you?

20:28.370 --> 20:33.000
Kiddo, l haven't been this excited since
the last time l saw my belt buckle.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.310
You were awesome tonight.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.960
Thank you.

20:37.040 --> 20:41.190
l can't believe you were foolish enough
to let this old hillbilly out on stage.

20:41.270 --> 20:45.860
Hey, if you can't be a fool for family,
who can you be a fool for?

20:47.260 --> 20:48.490
So what are you going to do now?

20:48.580 --> 20:51.780
l'm going to go home. l miss my Pearl.

20:53.180 --> 20:55.210
But what about your rock star dream?

20:55.290 --> 20:58.360
l lived it tonight, thanks to you.

20:58.450 --> 21:03.560
And sitting here, l've realised
something very, very important.

21:03.640 --> 21:04.670
What's that?

21:04.760 --> 21:06.310
l can't get up.

21:07.550 --> 21:10.270
-How about l help you up?
-All right.

21:17.760 --> 21:20.950
<i>What's next? Oh, yeah</i>.
<i>Hannah Montana</i>.

21:21.030 --> 21:25.980
<i>First of all, the name. lt rhymes</i>.
<i>cute, but why</i> ?

21:28.980 --> 21:31.490
This is not starting off well.

21:31.580 --> 21:33.130
Why don't l just change the channel?

21:33.220 --> 21:35.440
l think <i>Are You Dumber Than A Dog</i> ?
is on.

21:35.530 --> 21:38.840
Yeah! lt'll be much more fun watching
Oliver lose to the beagle again.

21:38.930 --> 21:41.360
That dog was coached!

21:42.600 --> 21:47.790
Guys, it's cool. l did right by my family,
and that's all that matters.

21:47.870 --> 21:50.300
<i>Hannah and her ban</i> d
<i>gave one of the mos</i> t

21:50.390 --> 21:55.460
<i>bizarre, chaotic performance</i> s
<i>l've ever experienced</i>.

21:56.020 --> 21:58.370
Don't care, don't care, don't care.

21:58.460 --> 22:01.610
<i>And l loved every minute of it</i>.

22:01.690 --> 22:06.760
<i>lt was pure old school</i>,
<i>kick-butt rock and roll</i>.

22:06.850 --> 22:09.520
<i>The way it should be</i>.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.360
Yes! ln your face, Mikayla!
