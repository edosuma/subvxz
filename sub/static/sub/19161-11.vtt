<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

00:02.504 --> 00:04.214
Polly's our woman
on the inside.

00:04.422 --> 00:06.091
<i>Blossoms had something
to do with Jason's death.</i>

00:06.299 --> 00:07.175
And I'm gonna prove it.

00:07.467 --> 00:11.096
My dad hired Jughead's dad
to trash the drive-in.

00:11.304 --> 00:13.598
Dad, did you have
anything to do with
Jason Blossom's death?

00:13.807 --> 00:14.724
I'm no killer.

00:14.933 --> 00:16.601
- Do you believe him?
- I do.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.561
Hiram Lodge's
daughter is here.

00:18.770 --> 00:20.939
She said something
about her father being
connected to Jason's murder.

00:21.147 --> 00:23.274
These kids are more
on the ball than the Sheriff.

00:25.110 --> 00:26.111
<i>I'm messed up, Veronica...</i>

00:26.319 --> 00:27.612
<i>Every day I wonder,</i>

00:27.821 --> 00:29.614
<i>what if I had left Riverdale
with my mom?</i>

00:29.823 --> 00:31.074
Hi, honey.

of Jason Blossom</i>

00:45.130 --> 00:48.091

00:48.299 --> 00:50.135

00:50.343 --> 00:51.594

00:51.803 --> 00:53.513
<i>Take Homecoming, for instance.</i>

00:53.722 --> 00:55.682

00:55.890 --> 00:58.393

01:03.148 --> 01:05.525
I'm just handing off some of
my decorating duties to Ethel

01:05.734 --> 01:07.444
so I can keep focusing on
the <i>Blue and Gold.</i>

01:07.652 --> 01:08.486
Unacceptable.

01:08.862 --> 01:11.614
You made a commitment,
Ms. Cooper,
you need to honor it.

01:11.823 --> 01:14.576
Especially since
this Homecoming is
also a Reunion Weekend.

01:14.784 --> 01:16.036
<i>As in previous years,</i>

01:16.244 --> 01:18.204

<i>more carefree days.</i>

01:23.418 --> 01:27.005
<i>Or to make up for lost time.</i>

01:27.213 --> 01:28.757
Archie, the reason
why I came...

01:28.965 --> 01:30.175
You came
because of the divorce.

01:31.843 --> 01:32.927
Because I called Dad.

01:33.136 --> 01:36.931
You know, I thought that
Riverdale would be better
for you than Chicago.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.808
- It would be safer...
- It's okay, Mom.

01:40.602 --> 01:41.561
Really, I'm okay.

01:43.563 --> 01:45.148
And I mean,
it hasn't been all bad.

01:45.356 --> 01:46.858
My friends are amazing.

01:47.067 --> 01:49.611
Dad and I are closer than
ever right now. And also...

01:49.819 --> 01:50.862
You've been singing.

01:51.071 --> 01:52.864
Songwriting, yeah.
And singing.

01:53.073 --> 01:55.450
- And your dad tells me
that you're great.

01:55.658 --> 01:57.577
I hope you'll play me
some songs before I go.

01:57.786 --> 01:58.703
Yeah, for sure.

01:59.662 --> 02:02.373
I'm playing at the dance.
So, if you want
to see me play live...

02:07.212 --> 02:09.130
That's incredible, Paul.

02:09.339 --> 02:11.174
You will keep us posted,
won't you?

02:12.342 --> 02:13.968
Okay, thanks... Thank you.

02:15.345 --> 02:16.554
Some good news for a change?

02:16.763 --> 02:18.723
That was your dad's attorney.

02:18.932 --> 02:20.642
Turns out, our statements
did make a difference

02:20.850 --> 02:22.894
and the judge seems
inclined to give
your father a break.

02:23.103 --> 02:24.104
How much of a break?

02:24.312 --> 02:26.231
Time served.
A few more months,
if that.

02:26.439 --> 02:27.732
And then what?

02:27.941 --> 02:29.067
We move back to New York?

02:29.275 --> 02:30.568
Or your father moves here.

02:30.777 --> 02:32.737
What about the crimes
he's committed?

02:32.946 --> 02:35.031
Including, maybe,
Jason Blossom.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.117
Stop it, Veronica.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.452
There is no proof
that your father had
anything to do with that.

02:39.661 --> 02:41.496
He's in jail because of
the Blossoms, Mom,

02:41.704 --> 02:43.206
that gives him a motive.

02:43.414 --> 02:46.960
Okay. Veronica, you need to be
supporting your father,

02:47.168 --> 02:48.795
not demonizing him...

02:49.003 --> 02:51.965
Again, for things that
you have no proof of.

03:12.402 --> 03:13.403
Dad,

03:13.736 --> 03:15.071
have you been body-snatched?

03:15.280 --> 03:16.739
Oh, I feel good, Jug.

03:16.948 --> 03:18.616
Wanna look good, too.

03:18.825 --> 03:20.910
Shave.
Clean the place up a bit.

03:21.119 --> 03:22.245
A little paint...

03:22.453 --> 03:23.913
Oh, I got us some
coffee and donuts.

03:24.122 --> 03:25.957
And I read your, uh...
Your essay?

03:26.166 --> 03:27.333
Manuscript?

03:27.542 --> 03:29.127
- You did?
- Yeah.

03:29.335 --> 03:31.379
- Really?
- I asked you for it, didn't I?

03:31.588 --> 03:33.423
Yeah, I don't know.
I figured you were just
pretending to be interested.

03:33.631 --> 03:35.175
This is excellent.

03:35.383 --> 03:38.344
Me, I can barely
string two sentences together,

03:38.553 --> 03:40.096
but you... You got a gift.

03:40.597 --> 03:42.432
Thank God you're
not wasting it.

03:42.640 --> 03:43.766
Mind if I ask you
a couple questions?

03:43.975 --> 03:45.768
Yeah. Of course.

03:45.977 --> 03:48.146
Why Jason Blossom, huh?

03:48.354 --> 03:50.190
Out of all the things
you could write about,

03:50.398 --> 03:51.649
why pick a dead kid?

03:51.858 --> 03:53.651
I don't know. It was
sort like he picked me.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.488
Tell the story that no one
was gonna tell.

03:57.697 --> 03:58.740
Or even know how to tell.

03:58.948 --> 04:00.533
From the outside, looking in.

04:00.742 --> 04:01.826
Who do you think killed him?

04:02.744 --> 04:05.288
I mean, you and Betty
are in this deep.
You gotta have an opinion.

04:06.831 --> 04:09.667
To me, I don't think
the question is,

04:09.876 --> 04:10.793
"Whodunnit?"

04:11.002 --> 04:12.754
I think the real question is

04:12.962 --> 04:15.131
whether Riverdale
is a place of good

04:15.340 --> 04:17.300
or a place of
darkness and evil.

04:17.508 --> 04:18.259
Or both.

04:18.468 --> 04:19.469
Most things are both.

04:21.054 --> 04:22.305
Can I make one suggestion?

04:22.513 --> 04:24.974
That's what Betty says,
and then it's about
a dozen suggestions.

04:25.183 --> 04:27.810
I think, at a certain point,
you should

04:29.270 --> 04:30.230
move on.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.441
You can't let this be
the only story you're
gonna tell, Jughead.

04:33.650 --> 04:35.401
Hell, it shouldn't even be
the most important one.

04:39.614 --> 04:41.032
Ronnie, wait up.

04:41.241 --> 04:43.243
Hey, I just wanted
to explain why I didn't
call you after the party.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.702
My mom showed up
out of nowhere.

04:44.911 --> 04:46.371
It's fine, you don't
owe me an explanation.

04:46.579 --> 04:47.664
Wait, Veronica,

04:48.206 --> 04:50.917
are we seriously not
gonna talk about what
happened between us?

04:51.125 --> 04:52.335
Archie.

04:54.921 --> 04:58.800
We had a moment.
A beautiful,
but fleeting moment.

04:59.008 --> 05:01.386
- We spent the night.
- We crashed,
in separate beds.

05:01.594 --> 05:03.763
I don't regret anything
we said, Veronica, or did.

05:03.972 --> 05:05.056
Me neither,

05:05.265 --> 05:07.058
but I think you might be
boyfriend-worthy.

05:07.267 --> 05:09.560
I agree. Let's test
that theory at the
Homecoming Dance.

05:09.769 --> 05:11.312
Unfortunately, I don't
have the bandwidth

05:11.521 --> 05:13.564
to explore anything
with anyone right now.

05:13.773 --> 05:15.400
Well, in that case,

05:15.608 --> 05:17.986
what if we just finally get to
sing that duet together?

05:18.194 --> 05:20.154
I kind of told my mom
I was performing.

05:23.658 --> 05:26.411
Look, Archie, I'm sorry,
but for a million reasons,

05:26.619 --> 05:28.538
we're going to have to
pretend our moment
never happened.

05:30.748 --> 05:31.708
I'll see you later.

05:38.756 --> 05:40.049
Oh, finally, close that door.

05:42.552 --> 05:45.096
Ladies, I need you
to look around the room.

05:45.305 --> 05:47.765
Whoever is not in this room
is on the table

05:47.974 --> 05:49.684
as a possible murder suspect.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.060
Including those Pussycats.

05:51.269 --> 05:52.437
Oh, my God, Mom...

05:53.187 --> 05:56.357
Now, let's talk
about your father.

05:56.941 --> 06:00.778
He has an epic grudge
against the Blossoms,
so yes.

06:00.987 --> 06:02.363
It's totally within the
realm of possibility

06:02.572 --> 06:06.242
that he hired someone
from jail to kill Jason.

06:06.451 --> 06:07.910
Maybe Jughead's dad.

06:08.119 --> 06:09.787
You really believe that?

06:09.996 --> 06:13.291
My dad paid Jughead's
dad to trash the drive-in.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.877
- Maybe he paid him to...
- Commit murder.

06:16.085 --> 06:19.756
And, for all we know,
that gay Greaser Serpent
is an accomplice.

06:19.964 --> 06:21.215
And what are you
basing that off of?

06:21.424 --> 06:23.926
That you saw FP
and Joaquin talking?

06:24.135 --> 06:25.261
It didn't look like
they were talking.

06:25.470 --> 06:26.512
It looked like
they were conspiring.

06:26.721 --> 06:28.139
Conspiring about what?

06:28.348 --> 06:29.974
That's what
I need you to find out.

06:30.183 --> 06:32.477
Either through Jughead
or FP directly,

06:32.685 --> 06:34.937
without raising suspicion,
of course.

06:35.146 --> 06:38.983
Which is why I have
prepared a seemingly
innocuous list of questions.

06:39.192 --> 06:41.194
I already asked Jughead,
point-blank,

06:41.402 --> 06:43.488
if he thought his father
had anything to do
with Jason's death,

06:43.696 --> 06:44.739
and he said no.

06:45.156 --> 06:47.617
And I believed him,
and I still believe him.

06:48.409 --> 06:49.452
Betty, you're
too close to this.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.829
I'm not going
to insult Jughead

06:52.038 --> 06:54.082
or betray him
by entertaining this.

06:54.624 --> 06:58.127
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a Homecoming Dance
to plan.

06:59.712 --> 07:00.713
Come on, Vee, let's go.

07:46.050 --> 07:47.135
Mrs. Cooper?

07:47.552 --> 07:48.261
Yes?

07:53.599 --> 07:56.227
I understand why Betty
doesn't want to get
in the middle of this.

07:56.436 --> 07:59.605
But I don't feel the same
loyalty for the Jones
family that she does.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.900
- I'm listening.
- Helping you
find out the truth

08:03.109 --> 08:05.736
about FP will help me find
out the truth about my dad.

08:05.945 --> 08:08.322
And whether or not
he hired FP to kill Jason.

08:09.198 --> 08:11.409
What exactly
are you saying, Veronica?

08:11.617 --> 08:12.869
I'm saying,

08:13.327 --> 08:17.623
if you want to go after
Jughead's dad,
Mrs. Cooper, I'm in.

08:19.792 --> 08:20.960
<i>Sorry to interrupt,</i>

08:21.169 --> 08:22.795
but I have an
announcement to make.

08:23.838 --> 08:26.382
One that tangentially
involves you, Betty.

08:28.259 --> 08:29.802
I'm bringing Polly
to the dance as my date,

08:30.011 --> 08:32.138
and we're campaigning as
co-queens of Homecoming Court.

08:32.346 --> 08:35.391
- Because why?
- Because, Nightmare Smurfette,

08:35.600 --> 08:38.644
by all rights, it should've
been Polly and Jason
on that stage being crowned.

08:38.853 --> 08:40.271
This is the next best thing.

08:41.439 --> 08:43.149
So... Don't forget to vote,

08:43.357 --> 08:45.067
and I'll see
everyone at my coronation!

08:46.611 --> 08:48.237
Betty, about the
Homecoming Dance,

08:48.446 --> 08:50.865
can I play a couple songs?
I kind of told my mom that...

08:51.491 --> 08:52.617
Whoa, you don't want me to?

08:52.825 --> 08:55.912
No, no it's not that, Archie,
it's just, um...

08:56.120 --> 08:58.873
This dance needs to be fun.

08:59.081 --> 09:01.167
And your songs,
as amazing as they are...

09:01.375 --> 09:02.919
They make you wanna
slit your wrists.

09:05.421 --> 09:07.798
- In a good way.
- In an amazing way.

09:08.466 --> 09:09.675
But no need to fret, Betty.

09:09.884 --> 09:11.344
'Cause Archie asked me
to sing with him,

09:11.552 --> 09:13.554
and we're thinking about doing
some upbeat covers.

09:15.431 --> 09:16.307
We are?

09:17.350 --> 09:18.142
Aren't we?

09:23.439 --> 09:24.524
Not that I'm complaining,
Ronnie,

09:24.732 --> 09:26.067
but why the change of heart?

09:26.275 --> 09:29.654
Because I'm hoping
you'll say yes to the
favor I'm about to ask you.

09:29.862 --> 09:31.822
Hey, if it's gonna help you,
then I'm in.

09:33.324 --> 09:34.659
Remember when

09:34.867 --> 09:37.912
you heard Clifford Blossom
say he put my dad in jail?

09:39.413 --> 09:43.000
Well, I think my dad may have
gone after Jason as payback.

09:43.209 --> 09:44.418
He's very eye-for-an-eye,

09:44.627 --> 09:47.797
and I have a strong suspicion
he hired Jughead's dad
to do his dirty work.

09:48.214 --> 09:51.551
Also, FP's done my dad's
bidding before.
He trashed the drive-in.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.679
It's a big leap to go from
vandalism to murder, Ronnie.

09:54.887 --> 09:56.389
I talked it over
with Mrs. Cooper.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.474
- And...
- She's a part of this?
Are you nuts?

09:58.683 --> 10:00.810
She's gonna keep FP busy
while we search his trailer

10:01.018 --> 10:03.688
to find anything
that links FP to Jason.

10:03.896 --> 10:05.106
Or, more importantly,
FP to my dad.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.024
We should
just talk to Jughead.

10:07.233 --> 10:09.402
No, what if he's protecting FP

10:09.610 --> 10:10.778
or tries to warn him?

10:10.987 --> 10:12.238
He's our friend, Ronnie.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.574
My dad is this close
to being released,

10:14.782 --> 10:18.369
and my mom's in denial
and she's ready to welcome
him back with open arms.

10:18.578 --> 10:21.789
Me, I'd like to know
exactly who

10:21.998 --> 10:23.666
we're inviting back
into our lives.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.710
Look, Veronica, I really
wanna help you,

10:25.918 --> 10:27.753
I do, and I definitely don't
want Jughead to get hurt,

10:27.962 --> 10:30.339
but I'm telling you,
FP's cleaned up his act.

10:30.548 --> 10:31.841
I hope you're right
about that, Archie,

10:32.800 --> 10:33.926
because if not,

10:35.261 --> 10:39.515
Jughead could get
dragged into something
very messy and very dangerous.

10:51.277 --> 10:53.946
- Hermione, hi.
- Mary Andrews?

10:54.614 --> 10:56.741
What... What are you
doing in town?

10:56.949 --> 10:58.451
Oh just a
spur-of-the-moment visit.

10:59.535 --> 11:01.454
I was hoping to surprise
Fred with lunch.

11:01.662 --> 11:02.830
Oh, he's off-site.

11:03.039 --> 11:05.166
He's picking up some
supplies from a vendor.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.293
Yeah, he told me that
you were working for him.

11:07.501 --> 11:08.502
With him.

11:09.962 --> 11:12.340
Yeah, he says
he admires your chutzpah.

11:12.548 --> 11:14.175
That's a very
Fred thing to say, huh?

11:14.383 --> 11:15.926
Yeah, but in this case,
I agree.

11:16.802 --> 11:18.262
You know,
I've been following the news.

11:20.348 --> 11:21.015
Yeah.

11:22.099 --> 11:25.102
Karmic payback
for being such a mean girl
in high school, I suppose.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.079
Polly, thank God,
what's going on?

11:43.287 --> 11:46.248
<i>And why are you running
to be Homecoming
co-queen with Cheryl?</i>

11:46.457 --> 11:47.541
To keep her distracted.

11:47.750 --> 11:48.834
Did you find something?

11:49.043 --> 11:50.628
Not yet, but they're
definitely hiding things.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.046
<i>Remember our deal, Polly,</i>

11:52.254 --> 11:53.714
if you don't find anything
by Homecoming, it's over

11:53.923 --> 11:55.091
you're coming home.

11:55.299 --> 11:56.592
I just have to get
into their bedroom.

11:56.801 --> 11:58.469
They protect it obsessively.

11:58.678 --> 12:00.888
Well, you're not putting
yourself in any danger,
are you?

12:02.765 --> 12:04.350
Betty, I gotta go, I'm sorry.

12:07.311 --> 12:08.604
Your daily milkshake.

12:10.314 --> 12:12.400
- You must be famished.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:12.608 --> 12:15.027
What, with all the
exploring you've been doing.

12:18.197 --> 12:20.074
The East Wing,
where Mr. Blossom and I

12:20.282 --> 12:22.910
have our sleeping quarters,
is out of bounds.

12:23.119 --> 12:26.330
Mr. Blossom values
his privacy. You understand.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.499
I'm so sorry.
It won't happen again.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.127
Good.

12:37.967 --> 12:38.926
Thanks.

12:39.677 --> 12:40.636
Hey, you.

12:42.304 --> 12:44.014
- Why didn't you tell me
about the dinner?
- What?

12:44.223 --> 12:45.766
Your mom basically
tackled me in the hall

12:45.975 --> 12:47.685
to invite my dad and I
over before the dance.

12:49.770 --> 12:53.190
- Did you not know?
- No, no, of course, I've just,
you know, got so many...

12:53.399 --> 12:55.609
Plates are spinning...

12:55.776 --> 12:58.237
I'm a little terrified
about the social
experiment of it all,

12:58.446 --> 13:00.531
but I think it's good

13:00.740 --> 13:01.949
for our families to
get to know each other.

13:03.242 --> 13:05.870
I think it's important
for us. You know?

13:07.079 --> 13:07.997
Yeah.

13:10.124 --> 13:11.542
I know what you're doing, Mom.

13:11.751 --> 13:12.960
Whatever do you mean?
I'm making peach pie

13:13.169 --> 13:14.503
for our guests.

13:14.712 --> 13:16.213
No, you're laying out
some kind of trap

13:16.422 --> 13:17.673
for Jughead's dad.

13:17.882 --> 13:19.383
On the contrary, Betty,

13:19.592 --> 13:21.635
I took what you said
earlier to heart.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.221
So you're not going to
question Jughead or his dad
about the murder then?

13:24.430 --> 13:28.058
I mean, only if it happens
to come up as casual
dinner conversation.

13:28.267 --> 13:30.936
I'm not playing this game
with you, Mom.

13:31.145 --> 13:32.480
And neither is Jughead,

13:32.688 --> 13:34.690
not after I tell him
what you're planning here.

13:34.899 --> 13:36.901
Are you sure
that's a good idea, Betty?

13:37.818 --> 13:41.405
When I invited Jughead,
he seemed so excited.

13:41.614 --> 13:43.073
Like it really
meant a lot to him

13:43.282 --> 13:44.825
that our families are gonna
get to know each other.

13:47.953 --> 13:49.121
That's all I'm after, honey.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.041
FP is innocent, Mom.

13:53.459 --> 13:56.212
Jughead said so,
and I trust him.

13:56.420 --> 14:00.591
I'm sure the question of FP's
guilt or innocence
won't even come up at dinner.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.018
Now, this is
pretty good.

14:12.061 --> 14:13.312
Oh, there he is.

14:13.521 --> 14:17.107
Son, your mom and I
are trying to decide between
pizza and Chinese food.

14:17.316 --> 14:19.819
- What do you think?
- Uh... We always do pizza.

14:20.444 --> 14:22.947
Let me guess.
Pepperoni and red pepper?

14:23.155 --> 14:24.824
All right, so, Moon Palace,
they still deliver.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.117
- We can get, um...
- General Tso's chicken,

14:27.326 --> 14:30.454
scallion pancakes,
vegetable dumplings,
family-style.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.040
What's wrong, son?

14:33.874 --> 14:35.042
Huh? Nothing.

14:36.669 --> 14:39.797
I'm just... I'm not used
to coming home and
seeing you guys together.

14:40.005 --> 14:40.923
It's nice, but...

14:44.635 --> 14:46.804
- Hello?
- Jughead, hey.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.391
Am I interrupting
a family meeting?
'Cause I can come back.

14:50.599 --> 14:51.517
Absolutely not.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.269
So, who's going to the dance?

14:53.477 --> 14:56.313
Besides your dad and me...
Oh, and Hermione,
whom I invited.

14:56.522 --> 14:58.148
- You did?
- We'll talk about it.

14:58.357 --> 15:00.901
Wait, you guys are going
to the dance? Together?

15:01.360 --> 15:04.154
We were talking about it.

15:04.363 --> 15:06.699
We both want to hear you play,
if that's still happening.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.284
If you're good with it.

15:09.869 --> 15:12.621
Yeah, totally.
I'm great with it.

15:12.830 --> 15:14.748
- Good.
<i>- So the worm turns.</i>

15:14.957 --> 15:16.166
Mary and Fred.

15:17.209 --> 15:18.377
A possible rekindling?

15:18.586 --> 15:20.504
That would've been
a Li'l Archie's pipe dream.

15:20.713 --> 15:22.131
Stranger things have
happened, man.

15:23.632 --> 15:26.760
Like for instance,
my dad shaved.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.847
Which is the equivalent
of tectonic plates shifting.

15:31.432 --> 15:34.852
I was thinking,
maybe it's time I go back
and live with him again.

15:35.895 --> 15:37.271
Based on the fact
that he shaved?

15:37.479 --> 15:39.857
Well, he also hasn't missed
a day of work,

15:40.691 --> 15:41.650
and he quit drinking.

15:42.318 --> 15:43.569
That's...
That's great, Jughead.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.238
But maybe you should wait
a little bit longer just to
make sure it sticks.

15:46.447 --> 15:48.782
No, dude, I'm telling you,
something has shifted.

15:48.991 --> 15:51.243
I mean, he even asked
to read my work.

15:52.161 --> 15:54.038
The essays, the articles
I wrote about Jason.

15:54.246 --> 15:55.372
- Your dad did?
- Yeah.

15:55.581 --> 15:56.874
And he read them.

15:57.082 --> 15:59.126
Even more surprisingly,
he engaged with them.

15:59.335 --> 16:00.669
He asked me
questions about them.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.380
- What kind of questions?
- Like who I thought did it.

16:03.589 --> 16:05.549
Your dad asked you
who you thought
killed Jason Blossom?

16:05.758 --> 16:09.470
You repeating everything
I'm saying is getting
really annoying.

16:10.262 --> 16:13.724
Crap, I forgot. My mom likes
almond milk in her coffee,

16:13.933 --> 16:15.309
and we don't have any, so...

16:15.517 --> 16:16.727
I'm gonna go get some.

16:17.186 --> 16:20.105
Well, you are
a terrible liar, Archie.

16:20.314 --> 16:24.360
Off to a late-night
rendezvous with a certain
raven-haired princess?

16:25.444 --> 16:28.364
Relax, man, I'm just giving
you a hard time.

16:36.372 --> 16:37.331
Archie.

16:41.794 --> 16:43.212
If this is a booty call...

16:43.420 --> 16:45.130
Look, I've been thinking about
what you asked me.

16:45.881 --> 16:46.799
I wanna help you.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.968
What prompted
this return to sanity?

16:49.176 --> 16:50.177
Jughead.

16:50.928 --> 16:54.348
He's been hurt and
let down by his dad
so many times.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.100
And what if FP
did help your dad?

16:56.308 --> 16:58.102
That's what I'm saying,
what if?

16:58.310 --> 16:59.561
But, Veronica...

17:00.604 --> 17:02.064
Jughead can never find out.

17:02.815 --> 17:03.983
And neither can Betty.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.332
Oh, Pollikins,

17:20.541 --> 17:23.460
it's much more fun
being friends
than mortal enemies.

17:23.669 --> 17:25.838
And I'm glad we're honoring
Jay-Jay's legacy together.

17:26.380 --> 17:27.923
This color
totally pops on you.

17:28.132 --> 17:29.675
Okay, so I was thinking.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.177
The theme for the dance is
"Blast from the Past," right?

17:32.386 --> 17:34.179
So, I say, we go
retro and borrow

17:34.388 --> 17:36.473
some of your mom's
vintage bling for the night.

17:36.932 --> 17:39.518
Ooh, you're naughty, Polly.

17:43.647 --> 17:46.650
My mom and dad
would fah-reak if
they knew we were in here.

17:47.443 --> 17:49.570
So let's take our sweet time.

17:50.279 --> 17:52.448
How many wigs
does your father have?

17:52.656 --> 17:53.949
One for every mood.

17:56.535 --> 17:59.079
Legend has it
that Clifford's hair
turned white overnight.

17:59.288 --> 18:01.248
Supposedly, he saw the
ghost of Grandpappy Blossom

18:01.457 --> 18:02.958
with his throat slit.

18:03.167 --> 18:05.294
Now, me, I love a silver fox,

18:05.502 --> 18:08.130
but we Blossoms live
and die by our red curls.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.674
My father tried
dying it once, but...

18:13.761 --> 18:14.511
But what?

18:18.766 --> 18:21.018
What is that?
What did you find?

18:23.979 --> 18:25.022
My nana's ring...

18:25.564 --> 18:27.024
Which she gave to Jason.

18:27.858 --> 18:30.152
He... He proposed to me
with that ring.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.780
So how does
your mother have it?

18:34.323 --> 18:35.282
I...

18:37.242 --> 18:38.535
Hands off, Gollum.

18:38.744 --> 18:40.579
The only way your mom
could have that ring

18:40.788 --> 18:42.748
is if she or your dad
got it from Jason,

18:42.956 --> 18:43.916
and he wouldn't
have given it up.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.250
Not over his dead body.

18:46.668 --> 18:47.669
Polly...

18:48.295 --> 18:49.880
You are carrying
precious cargo,

18:51.006 --> 18:53.133
but if you think
for one second

18:53.342 --> 18:55.469
that those babies guarantee
your safety,

18:56.470 --> 18:58.472
you're in for a
rude awakening.

19:10.567 --> 19:11.944
Super-delicious, Mrs. C.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.445
Sure is, Alice.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.615
Been a long time
since I ate something
that didn't come in a

19:16.824 --> 19:18.534
combo meal or a snack pack.

19:20.536 --> 19:22.871
- So, FP...
- Mmm.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.332
Betty tells me that you're
working for Fred Andrews now.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.836
How do you balance
that with all of your
other responsibilities?

19:29.336 --> 19:30.671
You mean like
being a father?

19:30.879 --> 19:33.382
- And being a part of the
Southside community.
- Mom.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.635
You can say
"Southside Serpent," Alice.
I'm not ashamed.

19:36.844 --> 19:39.763
And it's not just me,
there's a bunch of us
working on Fred's site.

19:39.972 --> 19:42.724
So, if you don't mind
me asking, I mean,
I'm just curious,

19:43.308 --> 19:45.352
how did you make
your living before that?

19:45.561 --> 19:47.855
I scraped by. Odd jobs.

19:49.606 --> 19:53.402
I know that you
worked for the drive-in,
Jughead, before it was closed.

19:53.819 --> 19:55.529
Did you find
work there, too, FP?

19:57.030 --> 19:59.032
- Dad.
- Well, hung out a bit.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.868
What can I say?
I'm a movie buff.

20:03.287 --> 20:04.413
So, tell me,

20:04.830 --> 20:07.708
were you upset
when Hiram Lodge
bought the drive-in land?

20:12.087 --> 20:13.088
Stuff happens.

20:13.297 --> 20:15.465
Let me rephrase that question.
Were you surprised?

20:19.678 --> 20:21.221
I'll get it.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.437
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:29.438 --> 20:30.480
Right this way.

20:35.319 --> 20:37.070
I thought you said she
wanted me to be here.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.280
She does.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.740
I mean, it is Homecoming
after all.

20:39.948 --> 20:43.327
And our families should be
coming together.

20:44.036 --> 20:45.204
Right, Mom?

20:53.378 --> 20:54.963
It's the same as when
we were kids.

21:04.932 --> 21:06.683
You start in the bedroom,
I'll start in here.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.818
You wanted an explanation.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.197
The last time
Clifford saw Jason

21:22.157 --> 21:24.910
was the day my son washed
his hands of our family.

21:26.912 --> 21:29.665
Jason wanted nothing more to
do with the Blossom name,

21:30.999 --> 21:32.209
nor our lineage.

21:33.252 --> 21:38.048
Including the ring,
which he threw in Clifford's
face as his final rebuke.

21:38.674 --> 21:41.009
Clifford then gave the ring
to me for safekeeping.

21:43.595 --> 21:44.346
I...

21:44.805 --> 21:46.682
I thought the ring
had been lost...

21:49.643 --> 21:50.936
Nothing's lost forever.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.940
Everything comes back.

21:59.236 --> 22:01.989
Now. Unless you have
any more questions,

22:02.572 --> 22:05.075
I'll leave you to finish
getting ready for the dance.

22:09.621 --> 22:11.832
And drink up, dear.
Before it melts.

22:26.221 --> 22:29.683
I'm hoping maybe you have some
vacancies down at Sunnyside.

22:30.267 --> 22:33.395
You see, I've been
sleeping in my office
down at the paper,

22:33.603 --> 22:35.439
and it's just getting a little
chilly at night.

22:35.647 --> 22:37.524
I bet your office
beats the trailer park.

22:37.733 --> 22:39.443
I wouldn't be so sure.

22:39.651 --> 22:43.030
You see, Alice here,
she's been redecorating
the <i>Register.</i>

22:43.238 --> 22:46.158
The other day, she threw
a brick through the window.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.784
- Is that so?
- Keep talking, Hal,

22:47.993 --> 22:50.329
and the next brick I throw
may not be at a window.

22:52.164 --> 22:54.333
You remember
our Homecoming, Alice?

22:54.541 --> 22:55.959
Hal? Back in the day?

22:56.168 --> 22:57.377
Castles in the Clouds?

22:57.586 --> 22:58.879
Your mom ever tell you
about that night?

22:59.087 --> 23:01.590
Just that she and my dad
were king and queen.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.175
Yeah, they were. Of hell.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.802
- Dad, please.
- No, this is a fun story,
I promise.

23:07.012 --> 23:08.180
Fred and me,

23:08.805 --> 23:11.433
we were all set
to play at the dance.

23:11.933 --> 23:13.727
I was backstage,
dropping off our gear

23:13.935 --> 23:16.146
when I heard
these voices yelling.

23:17.731 --> 23:19.024
It was your mom and dad.

23:19.483 --> 23:20.609
They were fighting about...

23:23.528 --> 23:24.654
About I don't know what.

23:24.863 --> 23:25.906
But it sounded like
life or death.

23:26.114 --> 23:27.199
Shut up, FP.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.867
Happy to oblige if you are.

23:31.828 --> 23:34.706
I don't care what you
think of me, Alice,

23:35.290 --> 23:37.793
but don't jerk me around.
Not in front of my son.

23:40.587 --> 23:41.963
This was such
a nice idea, Mom,

23:42.172 --> 23:44.049
but I think it's time that
we get to the dance.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.176
So, is it okay if we
skip the peach pie?

23:51.390 --> 23:52.682
What did you give her?

23:53.225 --> 23:56.937
Polly was so agitated,
I gave her an
all-natural relaxer.

23:57.145 --> 23:58.438
Nothing to hurt the babies,

23:58.647 --> 24:00.690
but she will sleep
like a lamb till morning.

24:02.025 --> 24:03.652
Was that story true?

24:03.860 --> 24:04.986
About how you
got the ring back?

24:06.071 --> 24:07.072
Every word of it.

24:08.824 --> 24:10.742
You know,
your brother rejected us,

24:10.951 --> 24:12.911
our way of life,
our business, everything.

24:13.120 --> 24:16.415
And after I had groomed him
to take over the empire.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.335
When really, I should have
been nurturing you.

24:20.919 --> 24:22.671
Jason never had
the stomach for any of it.

24:22.879 --> 24:24.005
But you...

24:25.382 --> 24:27.968
You're a Blossom,
through and through.

24:30.137 --> 24:31.138
Okay.

24:31.555 --> 24:33.473
One more thing
before you go to the dance.

24:34.474 --> 24:35.684
Nana Blossom's ring...

24:36.393 --> 24:39.604
It's not in my jewelry box,
it's not with Polly.

24:40.647 --> 24:41.523
Where is it?

24:41.731 --> 24:44.860
It wasn't my fault,
it was Polly's.

24:45.068 --> 24:46.611
She lunged at me,
trying to get it,

24:46.820 --> 24:48.155
I didn't know what to do.

24:48.363 --> 24:49.406
<i>I panicked.</i>

24:49.614 --> 24:50.824
<i>I thought it would be
better for everyone</i>

24:51.032 --> 24:52.534
<i>if the ring were just gone.</i>

24:52.742 --> 24:54.035
<i>Down the drain.</i>

24:54.244 --> 24:56.663
<i>That way, if Polly ever
said anything to anyone,</i>

24:56.872 --> 24:59.958
there'd be no proof.
Just her word

25:00.917 --> 25:01.918
against ours.

25:05.255 --> 25:06.381
Did I do something wrong?

25:06.923 --> 25:07.591
No...

25:08.425 --> 25:09.926
It's quite right what you did.

25:31.656 --> 25:33.742
Look, I checked everywhere.
Twice.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.327
But there's nothing weird
or dangerous-looking.

25:35.535 --> 25:38.288
Same out here,
just tumbleweeds
and dust bunnies, that's it.

25:39.331 --> 25:40.582
- We need to keep looking.
- Veronica.

25:40.790 --> 25:42.751
- Somewhere, there's
something that proves it.
- What?

25:43.376 --> 25:44.628
What are we even
looking for, Ronnie?

25:44.836 --> 25:46.421
A signed contract between
Jughead's dad and yours?

25:46.630 --> 25:47.714
I doubt they're that stupid...

25:47.923 --> 25:49.591
We'll switch... I'll take
the bedroom this time.

25:49.799 --> 25:52.677
You wanted to see if we would
find anything incriminating,
and we didn't.

25:52.886 --> 25:53.845
Then we'll look
somewhere else.

25:54.054 --> 25:55.514
Outside or under the trailer.

25:55.722 --> 25:56.973
Veronica,

25:57.182 --> 25:58.266
what do you want?

25:58.475 --> 25:59.684
Do you want your dad
to be guilty?

25:59.893 --> 26:02.145
I want to know, Archie.

26:02.354 --> 26:04.189
One way or the other,
I need to be sure.

26:04.397 --> 26:06.525
We can keep looking
forever, Ronnie,

26:06.733 --> 26:07.859
and never find anything.

26:08.068 --> 26:09.361
Then what about
when he comes home?

26:09.569 --> 26:10.612
I'm not sure.

26:12.030 --> 26:13.490
But I'll be right
there, next to you,

26:13.698 --> 26:15.867
doing what I can
to help. If you'll let me.

26:17.035 --> 26:18.203
And maybe I'm wrong,

26:18.411 --> 26:20.872
but not finding anything
tonight feels like a win.

26:23.041 --> 26:24.459
A major win for the home team.

26:25.710 --> 26:26.878
What?

26:28.088 --> 26:28.964
Just...

26:30.423 --> 26:32.551
"Yea, though I walk through
the Valley of Darkness,

26:32.759 --> 26:37.556
"and Archie Andrews
is there with a smile
and a sports metaphor."

26:49.359 --> 26:50.402
It's Mrs. Cooper.

26:50.610 --> 26:51.778
We need to go, right now.

26:51.987 --> 26:53.196
FP could be on his way home,
let's go.

27:08.295 --> 27:10.005
You be a gentleman
tonight, okay?

27:10.213 --> 27:11.464
He always is, Mr. Jones.

27:15.594 --> 27:17.262
Betty, would you mind
giving us just a minute?

27:17.470 --> 27:18.930
No, of course. Take your time.
Thank you.

27:25.937 --> 27:26.980
What's up?

27:27.689 --> 27:29.024
Look, I've been thinking.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.110
I mean, if it's
all right with you...

27:34.446 --> 27:35.739
I could come back.

27:36.990 --> 27:38.575
And I could... I could
come back home.

27:39.951 --> 27:41.536
I'll do you one better.

27:42.746 --> 27:44.456
It's time the whole family
gets back together.

27:44.664 --> 27:46.916
Us, your mom, Jellybean.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.294
They've got a
sweet set-up in Toledo,

27:49.502 --> 27:51.087
- there's decent work there...
- In Toledo?

27:52.505 --> 27:53.798
Well, why not Riverdale?

27:54.007 --> 27:55.634
'Cause of dinners
like we just had.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.761
And what you're writing
about in your book.

27:57.969 --> 28:00.388
And hell, you know
what happens to people
like us in Riverdale, Jug.

28:01.348 --> 28:02.432
We get chewed up.

28:14.277 --> 28:16.780
Well, it's not
the Met Ball, but...

28:17.697 --> 28:19.491
Thanks for letting me
tag along, Fred.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.117
It was Mary's idea.

28:21.326 --> 28:23.662
Always like to have a
beautiful woman on my arm.

28:23.870 --> 28:24.996
Tonight, I have two.

28:25.205 --> 28:27.874
Meanwhile, I'm having
major deja vu.

28:28.083 --> 28:29.542
Remember when
this was our lives?

28:29.751 --> 28:31.336
The best of times...

28:32.504 --> 28:35.256
Betty, tonight after
the dance, I'd like to talk
to you about something.

28:35.465 --> 28:36.633
It has to do with my dad.

28:36.841 --> 28:38.134
Is everything okay?

28:38.343 --> 28:39.511
Yeah...

28:39.719 --> 28:41.304
Actually, things are great.

28:41.513 --> 28:42.972
Better than they've been
in a while.

28:43.181 --> 28:44.349
I just kind of wanna figure
something out together.

28:44.557 --> 28:45.475
Mmm-hmm.

28:46.142 --> 28:47.394
Oh, God...

28:47.602 --> 28:48.937
Will you be okay alone
here for a second?

28:49.145 --> 28:50.146
I think I should be fine.

28:51.147 --> 28:52.315
I'll be right back.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.695
Cheryl? Hey. Where's Polly?

28:56.903 --> 28:57.946
She's fine.

28:58.822 --> 29:00.907
She sugar-crashed and
canceled at the last minute,

29:01.116 --> 29:02.200
leaving me high and dry,

29:02.701 --> 29:06.037
which is why I'm never
doing anything nice
for anyone ever again.

29:06.621 --> 29:07.539
Excuse me.

29:13.461 --> 29:16.423
Well, well, well...
Mary Andrews.

29:16.631 --> 29:19.259
Well, well, well...
Alice Cooper.

29:19.467 --> 29:21.553
Saw you swanning in earlier
with Fred and Hermione.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.389
I didn't realize that you were
a polyamorist.

29:24.597 --> 29:26.725
I don't think that's
an actual word.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.393
- It's a compliment, Mary.
- Huh.

29:28.601 --> 29:30.228
I couldn't be seen in the
same room with those two.

29:30.437 --> 29:32.230
Not after all their
monkey business.

29:34.107 --> 29:35.275
Oh...

29:35.483 --> 29:36.735
Oh... Did you not know?

29:36.901 --> 29:39.028
You have been playing
the same game
since junior high

29:39.237 --> 29:41.239
and it was tired
even back then.

29:41.781 --> 29:44.075
Fred is a big boy,
he can do as he pleases.

29:44.284 --> 29:47.495
I came here tonight
to have fun
with both of my dates.

29:47.704 --> 29:48.913
So, if you have
a problem with that...

29:50.457 --> 29:51.791
I have to take this.

29:56.463 --> 29:57.589
Hey, Kev...

29:57.797 --> 29:59.257
Have you seen Archie
and Veronica?

30:01.176 --> 30:02.510
Oh, never mind, I see them.

30:09.476 --> 30:10.560
What the hell?

30:19.068 --> 30:20.445
There you are, Ms. Cooper.

30:20.653 --> 30:23.281
Mayor McCoy would like
to review the evening's
itinerary with you.

30:23.490 --> 30:24.949
What can I do for you,
Mayor McCoy?

30:25.158 --> 30:27.744
Well, firstly,
I was wondering...

30:46.304 --> 30:48.431
- Would you walk me up?
- I'm sorry. What?

30:48.640 --> 30:49.557
To the stage?

30:49.766 --> 30:50.683
Oh...

30:50.934 --> 30:53.102
Actually,
Principal Weatherbee,
will you do the honors?

30:53.311 --> 30:54.646
I have to... Go.

30:54.854 --> 30:55.814
Excuse me.

31:00.944 --> 31:01.986
Where were you guys?

31:04.656 --> 31:06.074
We stopped...
We stopped at Pop's.

31:06.282 --> 31:07.575
And what were you
just talking to my mom about?

31:07.784 --> 31:09.536
- Betty...
- Guys, can we table this?

31:09.744 --> 31:10.703
We gotta get ready.

31:10.912 --> 31:11.621
Come on.

31:13.414 --> 31:16.084

We haven't exactly had
the conversation,

34:21.519 --> 34:23.980
but the Magic 8-Ball says,
"Yes."

34:24.188 --> 34:27.483
You Andrews men
are such players.

34:33.197 --> 34:36.784
This is the first time
I've brought a boyfriend
to one of these things.

34:36.993 --> 34:39.954
This is the first time
I've really had a boyfriend.

34:40.163 --> 34:43.458
Mostly it's been hook-ups
with closeted guys.

34:45.543 --> 34:47.336
Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt.

34:47.545 --> 34:48.713
Have you seen Betty anywhere?

34:48.921 --> 34:50.590
You all need tracking devices.

34:51.132 --> 34:53.760
I think she was headed out
to the hall with Veronica
and maybe Archie.

34:53.968 --> 34:54.886
Thanks.

35:06.064 --> 35:07.440
Before you get mad,
let me explain.

35:07.648 --> 35:08.816
Explain what?

35:09.025 --> 35:10.735
That you're working with
my mom behind my back?

35:10.943 --> 35:14.113
I'm sorry, Bee, but you know
FP had some kind of
arrangement with my dad.

35:14.322 --> 35:16.115
I had to make sure it wasn't
about Jason Blossom.

35:16.324 --> 35:17.575
And what's your excuse?

35:17.784 --> 35:20.244
I was looking out for
Jughead in case FP
was doing shady stuff.

35:20.453 --> 35:22.121
- To protect him.
- Blame me, Betty.

35:22.330 --> 35:23.539
I asked Archie to help me.

35:23.748 --> 35:26.584
Help you do what?
What did you two do?

35:26.793 --> 35:28.544
Guys... Betty...

35:32.924 --> 35:34.175
What's going on?

35:34.383 --> 35:36.594
Why do I feel like I'm
suddenly left out?

35:40.556 --> 35:42.475
Do you want to tell him
or should I?

35:43.309 --> 35:44.268
Tell me what?

35:48.314 --> 35:50.483
We went to your
dad's trailer to...

35:50.691 --> 35:51.984
To search it, Jughead.

35:52.610 --> 35:55.696
- Why would you guys do that?
- My mom put them up to it.

35:55.905 --> 35:58.032
She was
convinced he was hiding
something about Jason.

35:58.241 --> 36:00.660
We were wrong. All of us.
We didn't find anything.

36:00.868 --> 36:02.328
And Jug, we were only
doing it to prove that...

36:02.537 --> 36:04.122
That my dad wasn't a murderer?

36:06.999 --> 36:08.960
- You went behind
my back, Archie?
- Jug...

36:09.919 --> 36:11.337
How did you...

36:11.546 --> 36:13.506
When did you guys know
to go to my dad's trailer?

36:13.714 --> 36:15.091
We knew he'd be
at dinner with...

36:17.593 --> 36:18.511
No...

36:24.183 --> 36:26.144
That's why your mom invited
my dad and I to dinner?

36:26.352 --> 36:27.854
So these two could
break into his trailer

36:28.062 --> 36:29.272
while she interrogated him?

36:29.480 --> 36:31.482
No, I didn't know
what they were doing.

36:33.860 --> 36:36.070
But yes, that is why
she invited you guys.

36:38.364 --> 36:40.408
To think I was gonna pass
on moving to Toledo

36:40.616 --> 36:42.243
with my family for you.

36:43.119 --> 36:44.287
What?

36:44.495 --> 36:47.331
When we went to my
dad's trailer, you asked
me if I believed him.

36:48.249 --> 36:49.584
I said I did.

36:50.168 --> 36:52.879
- Wasn't that
good enough for you?
- It was. It was good enough.

36:53.087 --> 36:55.381
I didn't...
I tried to stop her.

36:55.590 --> 36:58.009
You could've told me,
you could've warned
me about this.

36:59.552 --> 37:02.054
You were so excited, Jug,
I didn't want to
disappoint you.

37:02.221 --> 37:03.848
So instead you lied?

37:04.056 --> 37:05.933
- You all lied to me?
- There they are.

37:07.852 --> 37:09.228
- Betty. Thank God...
- Mom, don't...

37:09.437 --> 37:11.731
No, you have to listen.
All of you.

37:11.939 --> 37:13.399
My dad just told Mayor McCoy

37:13.608 --> 37:15.067
about your dad, Jughead.

37:15.443 --> 37:16.736
What about my dad?

37:17.236 --> 37:18.237
He was just arrested.

37:19.822 --> 37:21.199
For the murder of
Jason Blossom.

37:59.612 --> 38:02.323
I'm not a perfect father,
Jughead, no getting
around that, but...

38:03.658 --> 38:04.617
<i>I'm no killer.</i>

38:20.132 --> 38:22.510
Kevin said someone tipped off
his dad, was it you?

38:22.718 --> 38:26.264
- I was at the dance, Betty...
- Answer the damn
question, Mom.

38:26.472 --> 38:27.390
And don't lie.

38:28.724 --> 38:29.684
Was it you?

38:30.643 --> 38:31.936
It was not.

38:32.395 --> 38:33.729
But I'm glad that you're safe.

38:33.938 --> 38:35.648
And as much as I like Jughead,

38:35.856 --> 38:38.651
- I am so glad that you are
done with that family.
- "Done"?

38:38.859 --> 38:40.403
I love Jughead.

38:42.154 --> 38:44.198
He's as much my
family as you are,

38:44.407 --> 38:46.075
more so right now.

38:46.284 --> 38:48.077
You are not going anywhere,
young lady.

38:48.286 --> 38:49.453
I am going to look
for Jughead.

38:50.913 --> 38:52.707
Do not push me tonight, Mom,

38:53.749 --> 38:56.544
because I will push back.

39:07.555 --> 39:11.100
If FP confesses, he might
drag us into this.

39:11.976 --> 39:14.145
Talk about our dealings
with the Serpents.

39:14.895 --> 39:17.982
But at least we'll know
if Dad hired him to...

39:20.151 --> 39:21.569
And if he did?

39:21.777 --> 39:23.279
And you can't
pretend otherwise?

39:24.780 --> 39:26.282
We'll cut all ties with him.

39:28.117 --> 39:29.577
He'll be dead to us.

39:29.952 --> 39:32.663
We may not be able
to walk away so easily.

39:41.797 --> 39:43.382
FP has always
had his demons.

39:44.383 --> 39:46.218
I really thought he'd
changed, Mom, I...

39:47.345 --> 39:49.597
It's very hard for people
to change, Archie.

39:51.515 --> 39:52.933
You know, after
I heard you play

39:53.142 --> 39:54.560
and before everything
happened,

39:55.644 --> 39:57.730
I was going to ask you
to come to Chicago with me.

39:58.689 --> 39:59.648
To stay.

40:02.151 --> 40:03.652
You could study music.

40:04.695 --> 40:06.238
I'm not even thinking
about that right now, Mom.

40:06.447 --> 40:07.740
No, I know, I know.

40:07.948 --> 40:09.909
It's just,
I want you with me.

40:10.534 --> 40:12.995
I don't think that this town
is safe anymore.

40:13.829 --> 40:16.957
I feel like Riverdale is
getting ready to
slide off of a mountainside,

40:17.166 --> 40:19.585
and I don't want you anywhere
around when that happens.

40:21.879 --> 40:23.798
Just promise me you'll
at least think about it.

40:26.342 --> 40:27.510
Yeah, I will.

40:42.233 --> 40:44.193
That bastard
killed my baby.

40:45.778 --> 40:47.988
He killed my Jason.

40:48.906 --> 40:51.742
I want him dead
for what he did.

40:52.451 --> 40:53.661
You have my word, darling.

40:55.871 --> 40:56.831
You have my word.

41:10.302 --> 41:12.763
Pop... Jughead hasn't
been by, has he?

41:12.972 --> 41:16.100
Nope. You're not the
only one who's come
looking for him.

41:19.061 --> 41:20.229
Betty...

41:20.438 --> 41:21.856
- Thank goodness.
- We were gonna call you.

41:22.064 --> 41:25.484
I'm not talking to you,
either of you, ever again.

41:25.693 --> 41:27.194
It's about Jughead.

41:27.403 --> 41:29.447
Kevin called me. And he said
his dad found a gun,

41:29.655 --> 41:31.198
the gun that killed Jason,

41:31.407 --> 41:32.533
in a lockbox in FP's closet.

41:32.741 --> 41:34.076
But Betty, we searched
FP's trailer.

41:34.285 --> 41:35.536
We looked through that closet.

41:35.744 --> 41:37.163
And there was no lockbox.

41:38.372 --> 41:40.249
Someone put it there
after we left.

41:40.458 --> 41:41.667
He's being framed.
