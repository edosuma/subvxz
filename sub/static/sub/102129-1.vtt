<i>...overlooking the Pacific</i>

01:11.442 --> 01:14.289
<i>New West Recovery

01:14.322 --> 01:18.194

<i>Seems nice,
doesn't it?</i>

01:45.713 --> 01:47.537
<i>I'm going to let you in
on a little secret.</i>

01:49.170 --> 01:52.050
<i>In 2008, when the Affordable
Care Act was signed,</i>

01:52.082 --> 01:56.817
<i>it required every health care provider
to cover substance abuse treatment.</i>

01:56.850 --> 01:59.697
<i>Since the bill was passed,
nearly 2,000 sober livings,</i>

01:59.730 --> 02:02.897
<i>100 inpatient treatment centers
and 200 detoxes</i>

02:02.929 --> 02:06.737
<i>have opened up shop just
in Southern California alone.</i>

02:07.570 --> 02:11.025
<i>Yeah, business
is fucking booming.</i>

02:11.058 --> 02:14.802
<i>That's nearly 35,000 beds that
need to be filled each month</i>

02:14.834 --> 02:17.682
<i>and almost half a million
that need to be filled a year.</i>

02:17.714 --> 02:21.777
<i>Off the top of my head, that's
somewhere around $12 billion annually</i>

02:21.810 --> 02:25.362
<i>and again, that's just
in Southern California.</i>

02:25.394 --> 02:29.809
<i>This is what we in the treatment
industry call "the fucking gold rush."</i>

02:39.345 --> 02:41.361
Do you want me
to fuck with you?

02:41.393 --> 02:43.538
Do you want me to fucking
fuck with you, bitch?

02:43.569 --> 02:45.329
- Don't shoot.
- Put the money in the fucking bag!

02:45.777 --> 02:48.626
Faster, faster...

02:48.657 --> 02:51.570
- Fucking move!
- You're gonna make me fucking shoot you?

02:51.602 --> 02:53.234
Fucking hurry
the fuck up!

02:53.265 --> 02:55.122
I'm trying.
I'm sorry. Okay, okay.

02:55.154 --> 02:57.809
I'm fucking done waiting.
Come on. Come on, come on!

04:33.617 --> 04:35.954
Hey. Can I get
one of those?

04:44.433 --> 04:46.289
- Thanks
- MAN 2: You good?

05:00.081 --> 05:01.041
Hungry?

05:16.209 --> 05:17.169
Um, I'll have...

05:18.065 --> 05:20.817
That's okay.
Get whatever you want.

05:20.849 --> 05:23.793
I'll have the Angel Fire burger
with fries and a Coke.

05:23.825 --> 05:25.393
Mmm-hmm.

05:25.425 --> 05:26.609
I'll do the same,
thank you.

05:27.409 --> 05:28.466
Coffee for me, darlin'.

05:28.497 --> 05:29.778
No problem.

05:29.810 --> 05:31.569
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:32.786 --> 05:33.746
So...

05:34.641 --> 05:35.601
what are your names?

05:36.626 --> 05:38.418
I'm, um, Utah.

05:38.450 --> 05:41.298
- This is Opal.
- Ha! Utah and Opal.

05:41.330 --> 05:42.929
Those are some names.

05:42.962 --> 05:44.625
I'm Wood.

05:44.657 --> 05:46.034
You with a church group
or something?

05:46.065 --> 05:47.666
- No.
- Hmm?

05:50.162 --> 05:53.522
It just takes more than an angel fire
burger to get some pussy around here.

05:53.553 --> 05:54.578
Opal, what the fuck?

05:54.609 --> 05:56.402
What?

05:56.433 --> 05:59.921
It's cool. I get it.
Can't be too careful, right?

06:02.289 --> 06:04.017
Uh, you guys from around here?

06:04.466 --> 06:05.841
I am.

06:05.873 --> 06:07.665
She's from, um...
She's from Cleveland.

06:10.673 --> 06:12.114
What... what about you?

06:12.146 --> 06:15.313
Near Chicago.
I moved to LA, though.

06:17.937 --> 06:19.730
Why... why are you here?

06:19.761 --> 06:23.313
You know, came through
for some business.

06:23.345 --> 06:25.137
How's here
compared to Cali?

06:26.097 --> 06:27.057
Close second.

06:28.274 --> 06:29.713
Ever been?

06:29.745 --> 06:31.697
- Oh, we've never left Ohio.
- Uh-huh.

06:31.729 --> 06:35.090
I went to Pittsburgh once for
a school trip. Zoo and shit.

06:36.529 --> 06:37.489
Uh-huh.

06:38.162 --> 06:39.473
Never seen the beach, huh?

06:40.305 --> 06:41.553
Yeah

06:41.585 --> 06:45.266
Yeah. So, um, how long
you guys been getting high?

06:47.409 --> 06:48.530
Excuse me?

06:48.561 --> 06:50.129
I'm not trying to start
any problems.

06:52.817 --> 06:53.777
I've been there.

06:55.889 --> 06:59.569
It wasn't that long ago I was in the
exact same situation that you guys are in.

06:59.601 --> 07:00.978
I know what it feels like.

07:01.010 --> 07:03.921
What kinda sick shit is this?
I fucking knew you were from a church.

07:03.954 --> 07:05.329
I'm not with a church.

07:06.417 --> 07:07.473
I work in treatment.

07:07.505 --> 07:08.529
That's it.

07:08.562 --> 07:11.378
- Opal, chill the fuck out.
- Let's get out of here.

07:11.409 --> 07:12.881
Calm down.

07:16.434 --> 07:17.457
Thank you.

07:19.122 --> 07:21.042
Thank you.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.577
- Thank you.
- No problem.

07:28.401 --> 07:29.522
Aren't you gonna eat?

07:30.098 --> 07:31.698
I'm not hungry anymore.

07:31.730 --> 07:33.458
- Look, we're being stupid. You ate...
- Ugh!

07:33.489 --> 07:35.921
- You ate the last time I did. I'm starving.
- I'm fine.

07:37.937 --> 07:40.178
All right. I'm out.
I'll pay for the food upfront.

07:43.025 --> 07:44.657
Here's my card.

07:44.689 --> 07:46.545
Give me a call if you wanna
do this again.

07:47.697 --> 07:48.978
Hey, thank you, for the burger.

07:50.738 --> 07:51.762
No sweat, kid.

09:38.865 --> 09:42.993
<i>All right, great job.
You have a total of 320 points.</i>

09:45.746 --> 09:50.066
<i>You're halfway through round three,
and now the questions are worth 400...</i>

10:22.418 --> 10:24.657
So, uh, what's up?

10:28.913 --> 10:29.937
How'd you do it, man?

10:31.314 --> 10:32.689
I mean, how'd you get clean?

10:34.833 --> 10:35.793
Treatment.

10:37.745 --> 10:39.602
Changed my old friends
and habits,

10:40.433 --> 10:41.489
made some new ones.

10:43.698 --> 10:46.129
It was tough, but worth it.

10:49.458 --> 10:50.514
How'd you get to treatment?

10:53.969 --> 10:55.697
I met a dude much like myself.

10:56.786 --> 10:57.746
He set me up.

11:00.657 --> 11:03.026
He set you up, what?
You... you set people up?

11:03.057 --> 11:04.017
Is that what you do?

11:06.897 --> 11:07.857
I could do that,

11:09.266 --> 11:10.226
if that's what you want.

11:11.282 --> 11:12.242
How does that work?

11:16.305 --> 11:17.841
All right.

11:17.873 --> 11:20.370
One, I put you on a plane.

11:20.402 --> 11:23.954
Two, you find a new way to live
without this bullshit.

11:23.985 --> 11:25.842
Three, start over.

11:25.874 --> 11:26.930
That's the way this works.

11:30.289 --> 11:32.402
Look, you said you never
saw the beach, right?

11:32.433 --> 11:34.482
- Yeah.
- All right, this is your chance.

11:35.186 --> 11:37.873
You could change
your whole life.

11:37.905 --> 11:41.042
Okay, look, say you get down
there and you don't like it.

11:41.073 --> 11:42.769
I'm willing to bet
my last dollar

11:42.801 --> 11:44.178
all this shit
gonna be right here

11:44.210 --> 11:45.585
waiting for you
when you get back.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.186
That sounds like
an expensive plan.

11:47.217 --> 11:48.626
Did I say you need money?

11:48.657 --> 11:51.345
Did I even...
Did I even mention money?

11:51.377 --> 11:54.321
<i>Remember what I told
you about the affordable Care Act?</i>

11:54.353 --> 11:56.241
<i>Well, what that enabled
treatment centers to do</i>

11:56.273 --> 11:58.257
<i>is take just about anybody
who had coverage.</i>

11:59.570 --> 12:01.298
Hey, Polly, how you doing?

12:01.329 --> 12:03.153
Yeah, yeah. Hey, listen.

12:03.185 --> 12:06.225
Um, I got a kid here, man,
that wants to start over.

12:07.089 --> 12:08.049
We got a bed for him?

12:09.170 --> 12:11.473
Ah, great.
Hold on a minute.

12:11.505 --> 12:12.785
You don't have insurance,
do you?

12:13.170 --> 12:14.385
No.

12:14.417 --> 12:15.441
<i>When there is no coverage,</i>

12:15.473 --> 12:18.897
<i>someone like Wood can put them
on their company plan.</i>

12:18.930 --> 12:22.257
<i>You see, people like Wood are
called marketers or brokers.</i>

12:22.289 --> 12:26.418
<i>Their job is to place people
like Utah in beds at facilities.</i>

12:26.450 --> 12:30.065
<i>Big treatment centers run by publicly
traded companies can rely on word of mouth,</i>

12:30.098 --> 12:33.746
<i>but the typical shop needs
boots on the ground. Like Wood.</i>

12:33.777 --> 12:36.626
All right. You bet, thanks.
All right, I'll call you back.

12:36.657 --> 12:39.345
You're all set, buddy.
You and your girl.

12:40.722 --> 12:41.714
I gotta talk to her.

12:44.209 --> 12:45.169
I leave tomorrow.

12:47.153 --> 12:48.626
Look, I know
it sounds crazy, but...

12:50.001 --> 12:51.889
don't wait to start
the rest of your life.

12:52.497 --> 12:53.457
This shit ain't worth it.

13:01.649 --> 13:03.057
<i>You fucking listening
to yourself?</i>

13:04.722 --> 13:07.442
You're gonna go with a stranger
to fucking California?

13:09.746 --> 13:11.378
You don't know anything
about this guy.

13:11.409 --> 13:12.594
But he seems okay to me.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.833
Because he bought you
a fucking burger?

13:14.865 --> 13:16.017
That's all the proof you need?

13:17.873 --> 13:18.833
You're fucked.

13:19.857 --> 13:20.849
You're fucked.

13:21.809 --> 13:23.633
Listen, Opal,

13:25.170 --> 13:26.705
now, I know
this sounds stupid...

13:30.289 --> 13:31.249
But I'm tired.

13:33.489 --> 13:34.674
You know,
I can't keep doing this.

13:37.394 --> 13:38.546
And here comes this guy...

13:41.777 --> 13:43.058
This could be
a fresh start for us.

13:46.065 --> 13:47.569
Have you thought about
how this ends?

13:48.753 --> 13:50.385
Wanna end up in fucking jail?

13:51.602 --> 13:52.562
Or worse, dead.

13:56.625 --> 13:57.585
What do you want?

14:02.418 --> 14:03.537
I don't know.

14:05.105 --> 14:06.065
But not this.

14:10.641 --> 14:13.393
All right. Well, then go.

14:16.625 --> 14:17.906
Get the fuck out of here.

14:21.233 --> 14:22.193
Opal!

14:24.146 --> 14:25.265
Please don't do this.

14:27.026 --> 14:29.713
Get the fuck out of here.
We're fucking done.

14:29.745 --> 14:31.089
Get your shit and leave.

14:37.970 --> 14:40.337
Look, man, I'm sorry,
but trust me, I know, all right?

14:42.578 --> 14:45.105
Trying to get clean with
someone else is hard as shit.

14:46.097 --> 14:47.057
Huh.

14:49.298 --> 14:51.122
You probably don't wanna
hear that, though, do you?

14:54.225 --> 14:55.826
You gotta do this
for yourself, man.

14:56.945 --> 14:57.905
Nobody else.

15:00.785 --> 15:02.353
Probably don't wanna
hear that, either.

15:05.553 --> 15:07.377
So you got anything on you
that I need to know about?

15:10.161 --> 15:11.121
Yeah.

15:12.434 --> 15:14.354
All right.

15:14.385 --> 15:16.785
Do what you gotta do to get
rid of it before we go inside.

15:17.361 --> 15:18.321
Yeah.

15:53.937 --> 15:55.538
You can handle all of that?

15:55.569 --> 15:57.362
Yeah, I'll live.

16:00.402 --> 16:03.026
And if I don't,
just, uh,

16:03.057 --> 16:04.017
leave me here.

17:17.906 --> 17:21.938
Um, it looks like

17:21.969 --> 17:26.609
Wood already sent over
your name, your birthday,

17:26.642 --> 17:28.658
and your insurance information.

17:31.634 --> 17:32.690
What's your DOC?

17:35.089 --> 17:36.049
Drug of choice.

17:38.865 --> 17:43.025
- Um, crack and... and heroin mostly.
- Okay.

17:46.609 --> 17:47.858
DOC, enough.

17:49.521 --> 17:50.546
And how long?

17:54.738 --> 17:55.698
Ten years.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.073
When was your last dose?

18:04.562 --> 18:06.033
Don't worry,
you're not in trouble.

18:09.681 --> 18:10.833
Around, um...

18:12.146 --> 18:13.586
3:00 p.m. today.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.529
All right, and any family?

18:17.042 --> 18:18.417
No.

18:18.449 --> 18:22.514
Anyone I can put down for an emergency
contact information just in case.

18:22.545 --> 18:23.985
Could be an employer,
a friend.

18:25.073 --> 18:26.033
Anybody, really.

18:37.649 --> 18:41.265
I think that is everything
we need from you right now.

18:41.297 --> 18:42.897
I know you're not gonna be
feeling too good soon.

18:42.930 --> 18:44.337
So let's get you to your room.

18:45.266 --> 18:46.226
Come on.

19:01.202 --> 19:02.417
Bathroom's through that door.

19:03.633 --> 19:05.937
Why don't you wash up,
get some rest.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.634
I'll be in in a few hours
to get your vitals.

20:19.602 --> 20:21.425
Fucking hurry
the fuck up!

20:42.578 --> 20:43.538
You were scared.

20:47.249 --> 20:49.969
Hey, Utah, I have some meds
for you to take, okay?

20:53.522 --> 20:54.673
Pussy.

20:58.002 --> 21:00.626
Utah, I need to do
some vitals, okay?

21:06.289 --> 21:08.145
I'll be back in a couple hours.
Get some sleep.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.290
<i>You were scared.</i>

21:21.681 --> 21:22.962
Hey, Utah.

21:23.537 --> 21:25.361
It's almost over, okay?

21:36.146 --> 21:38.289
This city's so fucking dead
at night.

21:40.242 --> 21:41.906
You hear that?

21:50.738 --> 21:51.698
Nothing.

21:55.857 --> 21:57.137
How are you feeling?

22:00.177 --> 22:04.145
- A little better, I guess.
- Mmm-hmm?

22:04.178 --> 22:07.953
Well, I'm Dr. White and I will be
your therapist while you're here,

22:07.985 --> 22:09.105
if that's okay with you.

22:09.873 --> 22:10.833
Sure.

22:11.569 --> 22:12.529
I'm Utah.

22:13.137 --> 22:14.577
They told me that.

22:14.609 --> 22:17.522
I like that name.

22:17.553 --> 22:21.650
It says here Mr. Wood
stumbled across you in Ohio?

22:21.681 --> 22:22.641
Yeah.

22:24.402 --> 22:26.033
He's a good fella.

22:26.066 --> 22:27.953
I remember when he was sitting
right where you are now.

22:29.361 --> 22:31.793
- You knew Wood?
- Sure.

22:31.826 --> 22:34.098
I never thought he'd make it,
but he did.

22:37.809 --> 22:39.665
How about you tell me
why you're here?

22:42.513 --> 22:43.473
I don't know, I just...

22:45.585 --> 22:47.186
Just tired...

22:47.697 --> 22:48.657
I guess.

22:50.993 --> 22:51.953
Tired is good.

22:53.009 --> 22:54.897
Yeah.

22:54.929 --> 22:57.074
Says here
you've been using 10 years.

23:02.930 --> 23:04.017
Why'd you start?

23:08.145 --> 23:09.746
'Cause the people I was around
were doing it.

23:13.137 --> 23:14.450
People that were
looking out for me.

23:15.857 --> 23:17.298
And were these people
your parents?

23:18.194 --> 23:19.154
Just people.

23:20.689 --> 23:21.842
Where are your parents?

23:24.849 --> 23:25.842
I never knew my dad.

23:28.050 --> 23:32.529
My mom...
died when I was 14.

23:32.562 --> 23:33.522
I'm sorry.

23:34.353 --> 23:36.049
How did she pass?

23:36.081 --> 23:37.265
- Cancer.
- Oh.

23:38.418 --> 23:39.378
I see.

23:41.298 --> 23:43.697
So you have been on your own
for quite a while.

23:46.194 --> 23:47.154
Yeah.

23:48.818 --> 23:50.097
It can't have been easy.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.361
Yeah, sometimes it wasn't.

23:55.346 --> 23:57.650
I think I will clear you
to start attending the groups,

23:57.681 --> 23:59.921
- if that sounds okay with you?
- Sure.

24:01.650 --> 24:05.298
Shit just happens,
and it's like I see red,

24:05.330 --> 24:08.657
like I'm on autopilot
or something,

24:08.689 --> 24:11.697
and then the next thing I know
I'm in some motel room

24:11.729 --> 24:14.481
with the blinds drawn and there's
a pile of blow in the corner

24:14.513 --> 24:18.866
and, like, some weird person
in bed next to me.

24:20.882 --> 24:22.674
But then...

24:22.706 --> 24:27.282
I don't know, I just, like, stay
there, like, for days sometimes,

24:28.946 --> 24:31.729
and then
it gets really bad. I...

24:31.761 --> 24:34.577
I start, like, hearing things,
I don't sleep.

24:34.609 --> 24:39.890
I start thinking, like,
I'm God's chosen drug addict,

24:39.921 --> 24:42.801
and then I can't stop
until there's nothing left.

24:43.890 --> 24:46.610
And what's that like
for your girls?

24:46.641 --> 24:49.073
When you come home
from going on a run?

24:50.514 --> 24:52.113
Um...

24:52.145 --> 24:54.705
I mean,
they're still young.

24:54.737 --> 24:57.297
Um, my youngest is, like...

24:57.330 --> 24:59.889
She's just happy
to see me home.

24:59.922 --> 25:01.425
My oldest one's...

25:02.066 --> 25:03.729
She's, like, four now.

25:03.762 --> 25:08.658
I can tell she definitely
knows, like, something's off.

25:09.842 --> 25:10.993
And what's that like?

25:12.273 --> 25:16.305
Knowing what she's seen,
what she knows at that age?

25:16.338 --> 25:17.841
It's fucked up.

25:17.873 --> 25:21.042
Um, my mom was like...

25:21.074 --> 25:24.753
She was the same with me,
but I know that that's not an excuse.

25:26.546 --> 25:27.921
I just...

25:27.954 --> 25:29.553
I wanna be a good mom.

25:29.906 --> 25:31.505
Like, I...

25:31.538 --> 25:34.482
I wanna tell them
that I'm sorry.

25:35.474 --> 25:37.490
But, like, I really mean it,

25:37.521 --> 25:41.841
not just say I'm sorry and then do the
same fucking thing over and over again.

25:42.162 --> 25:43.122
But...

25:44.145 --> 25:45.617
I don't know, it's just...

25:46.609 --> 25:48.050
It's just really hard.

25:49.170 --> 25:51.409
Mmm-hmm.
I do know.

25:51.729 --> 25:53.553
It's okay.

25:53.585 --> 25:57.266
When I was out there, my son,
what I put him through,

25:58.610 --> 26:00.594
I didn't think I could
ever forgive myself.

26:02.322 --> 26:05.713
And I had to learn that
we can't change what we've done

26:05.745 --> 26:08.082
or what's been done to us.

26:08.114 --> 26:10.002
But we can change
what we do about it.

26:10.865 --> 26:11.858
Hmm?

26:11.889 --> 26:13.489
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

26:13.521 --> 26:15.633
Can anyone relate
to what Tina shared?

26:16.337 --> 26:17.810
Yeah? Mmm-hmm?

26:19.569 --> 26:21.137
Thank you for being brave.

26:22.226 --> 26:24.242
All righty, now, before we go,

26:24.273 --> 26:26.801
I would like you all
to meet Utah.

26:27.889 --> 26:29.298
Utah, you wanna
introduce yourself?

26:32.241 --> 26:33.201
Hello.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.849
I'm Utah, from Ohio.

26:38.385 --> 26:42.513
And my thing is
crack and heroin.

26:42.545 --> 26:44.241
Hi, Utah.

26:54.065 --> 26:56.082
Nah, don't drink that,
don't drink that, don't drink that.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.513
They put something in that.
That shit's gonna...

26:58.545 --> 27:01.106
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not even playing with you.

27:01.137 --> 27:03.409
That shit is gonna make you
hard as a rock.

27:03.441 --> 27:05.874
No joke. You do not
wanna get a chub in here.

27:05.906 --> 27:08.817
'Cause you fuck one of these broads
and your dick is gonna fall off.

27:08.850 --> 27:11.282
Or worse, you could end up a daddy.

27:12.657 --> 27:14.193
You got any kids?

27:14.225 --> 27:16.946
- No.
- Nah, you don't look like you got any kids.

27:16.977 --> 27:18.450
I mean,
I can't talk shit.

27:18.482 --> 27:20.945
I'm sort of a...
I'm a two-pump chump at the moment,

27:20.978 --> 27:21.938
if you know what I mean.

27:23.121 --> 27:24.081
Mmm.

27:24.914 --> 27:25.905
I'm Sid.

27:25.938 --> 27:27.057
Utah.

27:27.090 --> 27:28.850
- You just got out of a group?
- Yeah.

27:28.881 --> 27:29.841
Mmm.

27:30.801 --> 27:32.113
Yeah, I don't go to that shit.

27:34.193 --> 27:35.153
When'd you get in?

27:36.498 --> 27:37.937
Wednesday night.

27:39.474 --> 27:40.817
Day three.

27:40.849 --> 27:44.082
Yeah. So they still got you on the
subs with a little Valium, huh?

27:45.170 --> 27:47.217
I'll give you two packs
of cigarettes for a Valium.

27:50.546 --> 27:51.665
Where you from?

27:52.401 --> 27:54.482
- Ohio.
- Yeah, but what center?

27:56.241 --> 27:59.025
- "Center"?
- What treatment center?

27:59.057 --> 28:01.106
I'm not... I'm not from
a treatment center.

28:01.137 --> 28:03.185
Okay, what? Jail, ward? What?

28:03.218 --> 28:05.298
No, it's my first time
in treatment.

28:05.330 --> 28:07.025
Oh, well, excuse me.

28:08.114 --> 28:09.234
So how much
are they paying you?

28:10.034 --> 28:10.994
What?

28:11.985 --> 28:13.778
Are you...

28:13.809 --> 28:16.754
Are you serious? I can't tell if
you're fucking serious or not.

28:16.785 --> 28:18.161
I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:18.962 --> 28:21.489
Holy fucking shit!

28:21.522 --> 28:23.505
You're like a fucking unicorn,
you know...

28:24.081 --> 28:25.458
Tina!

28:25.490 --> 28:27.441
Utah here is
a bonified first-timer.

28:27.474 --> 28:29.265
He's not making
a fucking dollar.

28:29.298 --> 28:31.761
Can you believe that shit?

28:31.793 --> 28:33.234
I didn't take a dime this time.

28:33.266 --> 28:36.146
Utah, if he's being an asshole,
you can come sit over here.

28:36.177 --> 28:38.769
No, he's... he's fine.

28:38.802 --> 28:40.946
You're a real fucking saint,
Tina, you know that?

28:40.977 --> 28:42.289
Go fuck yourself, Sid.

28:44.145 --> 28:46.385
Look, this whole thing
is fucking criminal, all right?

28:46.418 --> 28:47.985
You just gotta make sure
you get yours...

28:48.017 --> 28:49.298
UAs! Who's gotta go?

28:50.610 --> 28:52.817
Utah, will you pee for me?

28:52.849 --> 28:54.162
Um, yeah, sure.

28:55.346 --> 28:56.657
All right,
I'll see you later, man.

29:06.738 --> 29:07.698
Um...

29:09.585 --> 29:11.601
So I got you a little something.

29:14.450 --> 29:16.017
What!

29:16.049 --> 29:17.969
I'm not really
supposed to do that,

29:18.002 --> 29:19.857
but I think it helps.

29:19.889 --> 29:20.882
Thank you.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.154
Um...

29:24.753 --> 29:26.034
Let's fill her up.

29:26.066 --> 29:28.401
- I'll send a tech to come with you.
- All right.

29:44.978 --> 29:46.577
<i>Yellow gold.</i>

29:46.609 --> 29:48.081
<i>You probably
wouldn't believe it,</i>

29:48.114 --> 29:50.802
<i>but the piss in this cup is worth
more than an ounce of white truffle,</i>

29:50.834 --> 29:54.642
<i>beluga caviar, platinum, gold,
or even rhino horn.</i>

29:54.674 --> 29:56.625
Hmm, nice color.

29:56.658 --> 29:59.121
<i>Each cup of piss
pays $2,000,</i>

29:59.153 --> 30:01.425
<i>and each client can test
up to five times a week.</i>

30:02.225 --> 30:03.570
<i>Do the math.</i>

30:03.602 --> 30:06.737
<i>That's $10,000 a fucking week
of piss.</i>

30:08.082 --> 30:10.513
<i>There are three phases
of treatment.</i>

30:10.545 --> 30:12.529
<i>Detox.</i>

30:12.561 --> 30:14.930
<i>We generally bill 4,000 a day,</i>

30:14.961 --> 30:17.874
<i>with the typical stay being
between seven and ten days.</i>

30:17.906 --> 30:20.369
<i>Next phase is residential.</i>

30:20.402 --> 30:24.402
<i>The average stay is 60 days
at $2,000 a day.</i>

30:25.394 --> 30:28.049
<i>Lastly, is outpatient.</i>

30:28.082 --> 30:30.962
<i>We bill $2,500 a day for this.</i>

30:32.018 --> 30:34.577
<i>So, based on a 90-day program,</i>

30:34.609 --> 30:38.034
<i>detox, residential,
intensive outpatient, and UAs,</i>

30:38.066 --> 30:41.649
<i>that's $300,000 per person
per 90 days.</i>

30:41.682 --> 30:45.329
<i>And somewhere like New West
has 60 beds.</i>

30:45.362 --> 30:48.977
<i>That's $18 million billed every
quarter, and, wait for it,</i>

30:49.009 --> 30:51.825
<i>72 million billed a year.</i>

30:51.857 --> 30:54.386
<i>You fucking heard me,
72 million.</i>

31:01.938 --> 31:03.762
Well, well, well, look at you.

31:05.714 --> 31:06.866
Ohio boy makes good.

31:08.817 --> 31:10.578
A little sweeter
than Lake Erie, huh?

31:10.610 --> 31:12.146
A little.

31:12.177 --> 31:13.873
Man, I never thought
I'd see this.

31:14.385 --> 31:15.345
Me either.

31:16.946 --> 31:17.969
So, what's up, man?

31:19.025 --> 31:20.145
Nothing.

31:20.178 --> 31:21.873
Just came to check on you,
that's all.

31:21.905 --> 31:23.186
See how you were doing.

31:23.217 --> 31:24.882
Okay, all right.

31:24.914 --> 31:27.345
- All right.
- I'm good, I'm good.

31:27.377 --> 31:29.649
You know, I've never...
I've never felt like this before.

31:30.834 --> 31:31.794
Thirty days now.

31:36.017 --> 31:37.394
Come on, kid,
let's go celebrate.

31:41.073 --> 31:42.962
<i>So what did you do
when you got out?</i>

31:42.993 --> 31:45.234
I mean, I can't go back
to Ohio, right?

31:45.266 --> 31:46.737
Don't worry
about that shit, man.

31:47.346 --> 31:48.689
One day at a time, remember?

31:49.617 --> 31:50.705
Right.

31:50.738 --> 31:52.497
Just keep doing the right thing.

31:52.529 --> 31:54.770
Something will fall in your lap,
trust me.

31:59.474 --> 32:01.233
You spoke to your girl?

32:01.265 --> 32:02.897
No, I don't have
phone privileges yet, man.

32:02.929 --> 32:04.113
Oh, that's right.

32:08.306 --> 32:09.266
Really?

32:10.098 --> 32:11.186
Only if you want to.

32:13.074 --> 32:14.034
Thanks, man.

32:17.457 --> 32:20.145
Don't call her here. I don't wanna
hear all that lovey-dovey bullshit.

32:20.690 --> 32:22.193
Okay.

32:30.098 --> 32:31.314
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Opal.

32:33.170 --> 32:34.130
It's me, Utah.

32:37.074 --> 32:39.026
<i>What do you want?</i>

32:39.057 --> 32:42.257
Just wanted to check up on you.
How's everything back home?

32:43.249 --> 32:44.498
<i>The same shit.</i>

32:45.681 --> 32:47.121
<i>You famous yet?</i>

32:47.570 --> 32:48.626
No.

32:50.162 --> 32:53.777
I'm doing well, though.
I got 30 days off this shit.

32:54.769 --> 32:56.049
<i>I'm so happy for you.</i>

33:03.345 --> 33:04.305
Ah.

33:05.297 --> 33:06.257
Did you get her?

33:07.281 --> 33:08.241
Yeah.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.450
Love, man.

33:14.481 --> 33:15.537
She'll come around
when she's ready.

33:18.033 --> 33:18.993
Until then,

33:19.793 --> 33:21.042
you just do you.

33:22.034 --> 33:22.994
I got your back.

33:23.922 --> 33:24.914
Okay?

33:24.945 --> 33:27.602
All right.

33:27.633 --> 33:30.386
<i>Treatment isn't any different
than any other business model.</i>

33:30.417 --> 33:33.266
<i>Most comparable
is an auto mechanic shop.</i>

33:33.297 --> 33:36.242
<i>Like them,
we thrive on repeat business.</i>

33:36.273 --> 33:38.897
<i>If we don't do a good enough
job, they don't come back.</i>

33:38.929 --> 33:42.386
<i>If we do too good of a job,
they don't come back, either.</i>

33:42.417 --> 33:44.145
<i>The catch here is,</i>

33:44.178 --> 33:48.978
<i>the success rate in drug
rehabilitation is under 10%.</i>

33:49.010 --> 33:51.665
<i>That's why you really only need
one success story.</i>

33:52.593 --> 33:53.714
<i>A poster boy.</i>

33:54.353 --> 33:56.433
Good morning.

33:56.465 --> 33:58.578
For those of you who don't know
me, I'm Vin Lawler.

33:58.610 --> 34:02.385
I am the CEO and founder
of New West Recovery.

34:02.418 --> 34:05.809
<i>After that,
there's no incentive to do too well.</i>

34:05.841 --> 34:10.034
<i>The only upside is in keeping the
beds filled and the money rolling.</i>

34:10.065 --> 34:12.018
It is not easy to ask for help.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.298
It's not easy at all.

34:13.330 --> 34:16.305
In fact, I think it's one of the
toughest things in life to do.

34:18.353 --> 34:20.754
A lot of you
have come close to dying.

34:20.786 --> 34:23.409
Hell, some of you have been
brought back from the dead.

34:23.442 --> 34:24.945
And that is some serious shit.

34:25.458 --> 34:26.418
Serious shit.

34:26.897 --> 34:28.145
Pardon my language.

34:31.154 --> 34:34.130
Fifteen years ago,
I raised my hand.

34:35.666 --> 34:36.722
And I said, "I'm done.

34:37.745 --> 34:38.769
"I am done.

34:39.794 --> 34:41.906
"I can't do this anymore.
I'm sick.

34:42.866 --> 34:44.113
"I'd rather be dead."

34:45.650 --> 34:49.329
That's why I know exactly what
it feels like to sit right there.

34:50.225 --> 34:51.921
Or there. Or there.

34:52.530 --> 34:54.321
I know it.

34:54.354 --> 34:58.065
That's why it is the
greatest privilege in my life

34:58.098 --> 35:01.778
to think that I have the chance
to help you change yours.

35:04.369 --> 35:05.457
We are a family.

35:07.313 --> 35:09.714
All right, today's my favorite
day, you know why?

35:09.746 --> 35:12.081
Today is the day that we
get together once a month

35:12.113 --> 35:14.897
and we celebrate the milestones
that you've achieved.

35:15.825 --> 35:17.426
Because every minute sober...

35:20.882 --> 35:21.842
is a minute won.

35:24.018 --> 35:25.106
Give yourselves a hand.

35:25.137 --> 35:26.417
Yeah.

35:26.898 --> 35:27.858
Yes!

35:28.914 --> 35:31.473
Louder. Louder.

35:32.882 --> 35:34.033
<i>Yes!</i>

35:41.457 --> 35:45.009
<i>I've just had a hard
time with the dreams recently.</i>

35:46.737 --> 35:48.978
During the day it's okay.

35:49.010 --> 35:52.529
And you think that has anything to
do with you discharging next week?

35:52.562 --> 35:53.970
I guess.

35:54.002 --> 35:56.369
I mean, I've been in here
nine fucking months.

35:56.402 --> 35:58.257
And how do you feel?

35:58.289 --> 35:59.282
I feel ready this time.

36:01.041 --> 36:03.057
I think.

36:03.089 --> 36:05.042
Do you have
plans for when you get out?

36:05.073 --> 36:07.985
Things in place
to help keep you sober?

36:08.018 --> 36:09.842
I have
a sponsor this time.

36:09.873 --> 36:10.865
Mmm-hmm.

36:10.898 --> 36:12.081
Some new girlfriends.

36:12.114 --> 36:13.521
- People I can call.
- Good.

36:14.449 --> 36:16.017
We will miss you.

36:16.050 --> 36:18.545
But it is time for you
to make your way, huh?

36:21.554 --> 36:23.186
Utah.

36:23.217 --> 36:25.394
You just got your 30-day coin.
How do you feel?

36:26.642 --> 36:27.986
I don't know,
I guess I'm...

36:29.457 --> 36:30.417
I'm scared.

36:31.025 --> 36:32.337
Scared of what?

36:34.769 --> 36:35.729
To feel.

36:39.762 --> 36:42.513
You know, the one question
I keep asking myself...

36:44.754 --> 36:46.706
"Why should I?"

36:51.218 --> 36:56.593
On the one hand, I've been given this
fresh start to be or do anything I want.

36:59.922 --> 37:01.842
And, on the other,

37:03.633 --> 37:05.841
it scares the shit out of me.

37:08.433 --> 37:10.161
I don't know who this me is.

37:11.153 --> 37:12.881
This new me without the drugs.

37:16.017 --> 37:17.713
I'm with this dude all day long,

37:18.929 --> 37:20.178
and I know nothing about him.

37:39.570 --> 37:41.105
Utah.

37:41.138 --> 37:42.162
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:43.314 --> 37:44.882
Do you mind
coming with me to intake?

37:45.746 --> 37:46.706
Sure.

37:52.946 --> 37:53.906
Opal.

37:56.529 --> 37:57.489
When'd you get here?

37:59.249 --> 38:01.009
A few hours ago.

38:03.602 --> 38:04.753
This is good.

38:07.025 --> 38:10.130
I have to get her admitted, but I'll get
you a pass so you can come visit tomorrow.

38:10.161 --> 38:11.762
Okay.

38:11.793 --> 38:13.041
Now, you do
whatever she says.

38:15.122 --> 38:16.273
I'll come by tomorrow.

38:18.801 --> 38:19.761
Great.

38:25.362 --> 38:27.249
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:30.801 --> 38:31.761
I'm May.

38:32.657 --> 38:33.617
Hey, May.

38:34.865 --> 38:36.914
I just need to get
a little information from you

38:36.945 --> 38:38.673
and then we can get you
into your room, okay?

38:39.090 --> 38:40.241
Okay.

38:42.002 --> 38:44.690
Opal, what's your drug
of choice?

38:54.194 --> 38:56.306
So, uh, you see
your girl in there?

38:56.337 --> 38:57.297
Yeah.

38:58.034 --> 38:59.762
What happened?

38:59.793 --> 39:01.617
I told you she would
come around, man.

39:01.649 --> 39:03.825
Man, I never thought she would.

39:03.858 --> 39:04.914
So goddamn stubborn.

39:05.778 --> 39:07.153
We all are in the beginning.

39:11.217 --> 39:13.106
- What's that?
- Your cut.

39:14.322 --> 39:16.049
- My cut?
- Yeah.

39:16.082 --> 39:17.042
My cut for what?

39:18.929 --> 39:20.786
Well, technically,
she is your referral.

39:21.809 --> 39:22.865
That's your half of the money.

39:24.465 --> 39:26.802
Nah, I'm just happy she's here,
I didn't, uh...

39:28.466 --> 39:29.426
I didn't do it
for no money.

39:30.609 --> 39:31.698
- You sure?
- Yeah.

39:32.337 --> 39:33.297
I'm cool, man.

39:34.322 --> 39:36.177
All right. I get it.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.921
No problem.

39:39.953 --> 39:41.969
How about I just hold on to it
in case you change your mind?

39:43.889 --> 39:45.201
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:47.217 --> 39:48.177
Be right here.

39:53.489 --> 39:54.930
So, uh...

39:54.962 --> 39:58.770
I don't know, I was thinking about
getting you a day pass for this weekend.

39:58.802 --> 40:00.305
Thought maybe we could chill.

40:00.338 --> 40:01.650
- Sounds good.
- Yeah?

40:01.682 --> 40:02.993
- Yeah.
- All right.

40:03.441 --> 40:04.401
I'll let you know.

40:27.282 --> 40:28.242
How are you?

40:30.737 --> 40:32.337
I know. The first three
days are the worst.

40:33.362 --> 40:34.513
They got you on the meds?

40:37.617 --> 40:38.577
Yeah.

40:39.250 --> 40:41.233
- Yeah, I just took them.
- Good.

40:44.306 --> 40:46.097
Probably made
a fucking mistake, though.

40:47.697 --> 40:49.969
Yeah, I know
it seems that way, but...

40:51.537 --> 40:53.713
just hang in there.

40:55.218 --> 40:57.201
Um, we're not together,
you know.

40:59.058 --> 41:00.018
I know, but...

41:01.521 --> 41:02.577
I was thinking...

41:05.329 --> 41:06.417
you know,
with a little bit of time,

41:06.449 --> 41:08.177
and once you're better,
that we can be.

41:10.226 --> 41:11.570
I'm only gonna be here
for a minute.

41:14.929 --> 41:17.713
I got into some trouble...

41:17.745 --> 41:20.817
back home, and when that shit blows
over, I'm going back.

41:20.849 --> 41:21.809
What kind of trouble?

41:25.010 --> 41:27.345
I hit a pharmacy
and someone got hurt.

41:27.921 --> 41:29.329
What do you mean?

41:29.361 --> 41:32.081
Just fucking hurt.

41:33.233 --> 41:35.153
No one got killed
or nothing, stupid.

41:36.081 --> 41:37.041
Who did you do it with?

41:39.506 --> 41:41.138
- Rooster.
- With Rooster?

41:42.929 --> 41:45.138
- What, like, Skinhead Rooster?
- Yeah.

41:48.081 --> 41:50.066
What are you doing hanging out
with those douchebags?

41:51.729 --> 41:53.745
Well, you left.

41:54.866 --> 41:56.113
And I needed a partner.

41:57.489 --> 41:58.706
Guess I should tell you...

42:00.594 --> 42:02.066
he and I are together now.

42:03.506 --> 42:05.265
He's laying low
at his cousin's in Michigan

42:05.298 --> 42:06.929
and I came out here.

42:06.962 --> 42:09.138
- Man!
- What was I supposed to do?

42:11.889 --> 42:12.849
Wait for you?

42:16.689 --> 42:17.649
You left me.

42:19.409 --> 42:20.754
You ran like a fucking pussy.

42:49.682 --> 42:52.113
You're doing that
thousand-yard gaze, man.

42:53.202 --> 42:54.737
Shit is creepy as hell.

42:57.105 --> 42:58.194
So what's the deal
with you, man?

42:59.633 --> 43:00.785
What?

43:00.818 --> 43:02.642
I get you a day pass
for the weekend.

43:02.673 --> 43:04.497
We supposed to be chilling.

43:04.529 --> 43:05.841
Hey, man,
do you still have that money?

43:08.562 --> 43:09.522
Yeah. Why?

43:11.249 --> 43:12.402
I'm thinking I'll take it.

43:26.865 --> 43:29.489
Boy, I've never seen anyone look
so miserable counting money.

43:30.257 --> 43:31.346
Hell's wrong with you?

43:33.554 --> 43:36.209
Look around.
We're in California, boy.

43:36.242 --> 43:37.873
This is the Mecca
of beautiful people.

43:37.905 --> 43:38.993
You hung up over one?

43:39.506 --> 43:40.466
I can't shake it.

43:40.497 --> 43:42.801
Well, you need to get
the fuck over her, bro.

43:42.833 --> 43:44.593
You got a pocket full of money,

43:44.625 --> 43:46.290
ocean breeze
blowing through your hair.

43:46.322 --> 43:47.825
You know what I mean,
come look around, man.

43:47.858 --> 43:49.778
Life could be good
if you'd just let it happen.

43:53.393 --> 43:55.442
So is this, uh...
Is this what you do, then?

43:57.489 --> 44:00.369
I didn't buy that car by doing
charity work, if that's what you're asking.

44:03.218 --> 44:04.434
Hey, man, how can I get in?

44:06.801 --> 44:07.761
You serious?

44:08.018 --> 44:08.978
Yeah.

44:11.858 --> 44:13.393
You sure you ready
to leave treatment?

44:14.034 --> 44:14.994
I think so.

44:15.921 --> 44:16.881
You think so.

44:18.962 --> 44:21.297
I don't fuck
with fiends, Utah.

44:21.329 --> 44:22.578
I run a tight ship, baby.

44:22.610 --> 44:24.305
Man, I'm done with that shit.

44:24.338 --> 44:26.129
But you're sure, now?

44:26.162 --> 44:27.570
You sure?
Because, I mean, listen,

44:27.602 --> 44:30.002
a lot of what I do
is not pretty.

44:30.033 --> 44:31.793
Now, if you've got
a weak stomach, it's okay.

44:31.826 --> 44:33.873
I know a lot of people at food
and beverage could get you a job.

44:33.905 --> 44:35.858
Man, I cannot work
a nine-to-five.

44:37.970 --> 44:38.930
Me neither.

44:40.466 --> 44:41.810
You listen to me,

44:41.841 --> 44:44.177
you ain't gonna never have to worry
about money a day in your life.

44:46.226 --> 44:47.186
But if you fuck up...

44:48.594 --> 44:49.554
I don't know you.

44:58.994 --> 44:59.954
Where's my phone?

45:09.489 --> 45:13.394
I don't expect anything I'm
saying to change your mind, but...

45:13.425 --> 45:15.793
you don't have to
go yet. Mmm?

45:15.825 --> 45:17.426
I mean, there's a lot of work
still to be done.

45:18.258 --> 45:19.314
I feel like I'm good.

45:22.673 --> 45:24.626
A lot of people leave here
thinking that

45:24.657 --> 45:27.921
and some are lucky enough
to make it back but most aren't.

45:27.954 --> 45:30.257
I... I understand that.

45:30.289 --> 45:33.618
But really, Dr. White,
I'm gonna be okay.

45:33.650 --> 45:36.594
Sobriety is a long,
slow process, and...

45:37.458 --> 45:40.338
I'm still working on it
every day. Hmm?

45:44.145 --> 45:46.065
You understand
what I'm saying, Utah?

45:47.025 --> 45:48.401
Yeah, I do.

45:59.249 --> 46:00.530
You take care out there.

46:22.706 --> 46:23.697
What is this?

46:24.369 --> 46:25.905
This is day one.

46:29.745 --> 46:31.058
- Hey, Polly.
- Hey.

46:31.089 --> 46:32.689
I'd like you to meet
the new kid.

46:32.721 --> 46:33.905
- Hey new kid.
- Hey.

46:34.769 --> 46:35.858
Ain't no phone calls?

46:35.889 --> 46:38.513
No, uh, Vin said same time
and place this afternoon.

46:39.473 --> 46:41.297
Do you guys need anything?

46:41.329 --> 46:43.313
- Need anything?
- I'm cool.

46:43.346 --> 46:44.754
Yeah, we're cool.
Just gonna give him a tour.

46:44.786 --> 46:46.770
Okay. Great. Nice to meet you.

46:46.802 --> 46:47.953
You, too.

47:09.489 --> 47:11.601
Sounds like a fucking
symphony, doesn't it?

47:15.185 --> 47:16.145
What is it?

47:16.785 --> 47:17.745
This...

47:19.729 --> 47:21.842
is the American fucking dream.

47:42.769 --> 47:43.729
Jacko?

47:44.625 --> 47:46.833
Sup, baby?

47:46.865 --> 47:48.050
Who's this squib?

47:48.081 --> 47:49.106
This is Utah.

47:49.137 --> 47:51.729
Utah. How much time you got?

47:52.722 --> 47:53.874
I... I just picked up
my 30.

47:53.906 --> 47:57.073
Ah! Freshie.

47:57.105 --> 48:00.465
I just picked up my nine months.
Stick with the winners, huh?

48:00.498 --> 48:02.193
Hey. Hey, I wanna show him
a phone call.

48:02.225 --> 48:03.506
A call?

48:03.537 --> 48:05.298
And you brought him to the king.

48:05.330 --> 48:07.058
All right. Jacko don't play.

48:09.105 --> 48:10.833
All right.
What do we got?

48:10.865 --> 48:15.762
Uh...
West Virginia. Hmm?

48:15.794 --> 48:16.785
Let's do it.

48:18.289 --> 48:20.177
Got you, baby.

48:20.209 --> 48:23.282
All right, Miss Thomas,
your ass is mine.

48:23.313 --> 48:24.369

I'm happy to help.

48:46.706 --> 48:48.369
So, you see those commercials
on television?

48:48.402 --> 48:50.225
You know the ones with
the Rick-Moranis-looking dude,

48:50.257 --> 48:51.825
talking about, uh,

48:51.857 --> 48:52.849
"Are you or one of your
family members struggling with addiction?"

48:52.881 --> 48:54.833
Bullshit commercials
in the middle of the night.

48:54.866 --> 48:57.905
- Exactly. Those are ours.
- Right?

48:57.938 --> 48:59.154
Isn't that expensive?

48:59.186 --> 49:01.106
We're not running them
during the Super Bowl...

49:02.673 --> 49:04.497
That's not a bad idea.

49:04.529 --> 49:06.770
I struggled with
the same problem.

49:06.801 --> 49:09.201
Anyway, we run them
where and when addicts are at.

49:09.233 --> 49:11.282
At night, in targeted states.

49:11.313 --> 49:14.258
Ohio, West Virginia, Oklahoma.

49:14.289 --> 49:15.953
New Jersey's a good one.

49:15.986 --> 49:17.457
Well, ma'am,
let me ask you this.

49:17.490 --> 49:20.625
Do you know what your son's been
using, and for how long?

49:21.201 --> 49:22.418
Mmm-Hmm. Right.

49:22.450 --> 49:25.682
Well, in that case,
he's definitely gonna need detox. Um...

49:27.057 --> 49:28.946
Do you have insurance
by any chance?

49:31.922 --> 49:33.169
That's great.

49:33.201 --> 49:34.770
I'm gonna place you
on a brief hold,

49:34.802 --> 49:36.561
and let me just check something
on my end.

49:38.193 --> 49:39.410
Husband's in the union.

49:40.049 --> 49:41.138
Booyah!

49:41.169 --> 49:43.697
Now, see, union workers
usually have great insurance,

49:43.729 --> 49:47.217
which means they pay most of the
treatment center's bills.

49:47.250 --> 49:48.433
Uh, she's on hold.

49:48.465 --> 49:50.705
He's not worried she's gonna hang up or...

49:50.738 --> 49:53.233
She ain't hanging up.

49:53.265 --> 49:54.353
We're saving her baby.

49:55.698 --> 49:57.585
Look, we're in
the placement business.

49:57.618 --> 50:00.146
Now, what he's doing is checking
to see which treatment center

50:00.177 --> 50:01.873
will kick out the most
for the kid.

50:01.905 --> 50:04.305
We field the calls,
sell to the highest bidder.

50:04.977 --> 50:05.969
- Get it?
- Yeah.

50:06.002 --> 50:07.089
All right, handsome.

50:07.122 --> 50:08.721
Sea Breeze says 9 Gs.

50:08.753 --> 50:11.058
Take it.

50:11.090 --> 50:14.097
Ma'am, I'm so sorry to have kept you
waiting, but I have some good news.

50:14.130 --> 50:17.585
I made a few calls,
called in a favor, actually,

50:17.618 --> 50:20.690
and we have your son a bed
at one of our facilities.

50:22.193 --> 50:24.530
- Th... That's it.
- That's it.

50:24.561 --> 50:26.033
He just made 9 grand
in 3 minutes,

50:26.929 --> 50:28.113
Sign me up. Where do I start?

50:28.145 --> 50:29.554
No, no, no. Start?
No, no, no.

50:29.586 --> 50:31.665
- You ain't working here with these idiots.
- Miracles do happen.

50:31.697 --> 50:32.753
That's your people.

50:33.681 --> 50:34.706
God is great.

50:37.809 --> 50:38.930
<i>Let's go.</i>

50:38.961 --> 50:39.921
Come on.

50:44.177 --> 50:45.137
Let's go.

51:03.890 --> 51:06.513
- Hey, Tee. How you doing, baby?
- Good.

51:06.545 --> 51:08.273
Utah, this is Miss Tee.

51:08.306 --> 51:09.618
I see, he's a cutie.

51:13.106 --> 51:16.370
You boys want anything
to drink? Coffee?

51:16.401 --> 51:18.002
No, ma'am, I'm fine. Thank you.

51:19.377 --> 51:20.337
I'm all right. Thanks.

51:21.297 --> 51:22.290
All right.

51:22.322 --> 51:23.473
I'll go get him.

51:29.489 --> 51:31.249
What the fuck
is this place, man?

51:32.081 --> 51:34.418
Hey, just be cool, bro.
We're at work.

51:37.617 --> 51:38.801
Dave?

51:40.849 --> 51:42.194
Looking mighty rough there, bro.

51:43.857 --> 51:44.849
Ready to go back?

51:45.969 --> 51:47.666
I think I need
another day or two.

51:48.561 --> 51:50.353
That's not how this works,
you know that.

51:51.890 --> 51:53.682
But I have...
I have some money left.

51:54.225 --> 51:55.185
How much?

51:57.842 --> 51:59.249
Maybe $60.

52:01.617 --> 52:04.274
All right, I tell you what.

52:04.305 --> 52:06.258
I'ma give you till tomorrow,
is that okay?

52:08.337 --> 52:09.297
Sure.

52:10.130 --> 52:11.090
This time...

52:13.137 --> 52:14.802
can we make it in 3 Gs?

52:15.506 --> 52:16.466
Two.

52:17.426 --> 52:19.538
Nice try, though.

52:19.569 --> 52:21.297
Someone will be by
to pick you up tomorrow, okay?

52:22.449 --> 52:24.369
- Okay.
- All right.

52:24.402 --> 52:25.969
- Thanks, Wood.
- You got it.

52:34.929 --> 52:36.785
Yeah. Show me.

52:39.473 --> 52:40.850
Come over here.

52:40.881 --> 52:41.874
Oh, I love you so...

52:41.906 --> 52:42.866
<i>Remember Sid?</i>

52:43.569 --> 52:45.169
I'm Sid.

52:45.201 --> 52:47.442
<i>He ain't getting
better anytime soon.</i>

52:47.474 --> 52:49.233
<i>He's what we call a lifer.</i>

52:49.265 --> 52:51.410
<i>Lives off the rehab shuffle.</i>

52:51.441 --> 52:54.354
<i>Does his 90 days,
hits the street for a few weeks,</i>

52:54.386 --> 52:57.105
<i>then comes right back
for another 90.</i>

52:57.138 --> 53:00.689
<i>He's a living, breathing
ATM machine.</i>

53:00.722 --> 53:02.834
<i>That's the type
you have to keep close.</i>

53:02.865 --> 53:04.497
<i>You can't let them get away.</i>

53:06.289 --> 53:07.249
Woody...

53:07.794 --> 53:08.754
Junior.

53:09.010 --> 53:10.161
Hey.

53:12.690 --> 53:14.897
Count out 2 grand for me.

53:14.929 --> 53:16.370
Who's your friend?

53:16.401 --> 53:19.346
Oh, this is my girl.
This is Penny.

53:19.377 --> 53:20.786
Uh, she says
she needs a little help.

53:20.817 --> 53:21.969
I thought I could
bring her to you.

53:22.002 --> 53:23.858
You know,
she knows the whole deal.

53:23.889 --> 53:26.802
Utah, you guys... They know each
other, so I mean, she's good,

53:26.834 --> 53:27.825
Hey, Pen.

53:27.858 --> 53:28.818
Hello.

53:30.353 --> 53:33.458
So, Penny, you've ever been
to treatment before?

53:34.514 --> 53:37.041
Yeah, I just got out.

53:37.969 --> 53:38.961
Did nine months.

53:38.993 --> 53:40.401
She wasn't even being paid.

53:40.434 --> 53:41.777
I mean, can you believe that?

53:41.809 --> 53:43.857
That's criminal, baby.

53:43.889 --> 53:48.146
But you do understand that you have
to complete the whole 30 days, right?

53:48.177 --> 53:49.809
I mean, you don't get paid
if you leave early.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.522
Wait, I can't get something now?

53:55.442 --> 53:56.402
Babe?

53:58.385 --> 53:59.666
I got you, baby.

53:59.697 --> 54:01.137
Come on, Sid's got you.

54:01.169 --> 54:03.474
No, I mean, I told her
what the deal was.

54:03.506 --> 54:04.946
So do you have a spot
for her or not?

54:06.962 --> 54:07.922
Yeah.

54:11.025 --> 54:12.561
Don't spend it all
in one place, Sid.

54:12.593 --> 54:13.553
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:20.177 --> 54:21.137
Uh...

54:23.378 --> 54:24.465
You forgot something.

54:28.530 --> 54:29.809
Not until she's admitted.

54:32.306 --> 54:34.641
Right.

54:34.673 --> 54:38.834
All right. Okay.
Baby, you just hang in there, okay?

54:38.865 --> 54:40.210
And you're gonna give them
your information.

54:40.241 --> 54:42.801
And I'm gonna go get
us a little something special, okay?

54:42.834 --> 54:43.794
- Okay.
- Okay.

54:46.193 --> 54:47.153
See you around.

54:48.530 --> 54:50.577
So, um,
you have insurance, sweetheart?

54:52.049 --> 54:53.298
Yeah.

54:53.330 --> 54:54.673
You know which provider?

54:55.697 --> 54:56.657
Um...

54:57.170 --> 54:58.130
Let me see.

55:06.353 --> 55:07.377
Here it is.

55:07.794 --> 55:09.618
HT Platinum.

55:09.650 --> 55:10.610
Mmm.

55:12.626 --> 55:14.546
Fucking gold mine.

55:18.417 --> 55:19.761
It's gonna be just fine.

55:21.170 --> 55:22.161
Thank you.

55:27.090 --> 55:28.593
Man, you gonna tell me
what that was?

55:30.321 --> 55:31.826
That was good business.

55:31.857 --> 55:34.193
So they go to treatment
for 30 days...

55:35.570 --> 55:39.185
you get the kickback,
and then they get a piece?

55:39.218 --> 55:41.009
That's capitalism, baby.

55:41.042 --> 55:42.225
Some people need motivation.

55:43.697 --> 55:45.234
I mean, you don't care
what they do with the money?

55:45.266 --> 55:46.513
Not my business.

55:46.545 --> 55:47.697
Because when they run out...

55:48.242 --> 55:49.586
they go back in.

55:50.130 --> 55:51.602
Wow.

55:51.633 --> 55:52.593
And the house is yours.

55:56.465 --> 55:57.425
How many people?

55:59.153 --> 56:03.345
With a place like New West
where you was at, about 70%.

56:03.378 --> 56:04.497
Some places, maybe more.

56:05.361 --> 56:06.386
Does New West know?

56:34.865 --> 56:36.593
- Vin!
- My man.

56:37.586 --> 56:39.057
Utah, Vin. Vin, Utah.

56:39.602 --> 56:40.658
Utah.

56:40.689 --> 56:41.649
Slide in, bro?

56:47.985 --> 56:48.945
How you doing?

56:49.425 --> 56:51.185
I'm good.

56:51.218 --> 56:52.178
Wood here keeping an eye on you?

56:52.977 --> 56:53.937
Yeah, so far.

56:55.025 --> 56:56.689
He says we can trust you, Utah.

56:59.186 --> 57:00.146
Can we trust you?

57:02.417 --> 57:03.377
Yeah.

57:12.017 --> 57:13.298
That's for the last two weeks.

57:14.129 --> 57:15.410
What we got here?

57:19.697 --> 57:21.009
Ooh-wee!

57:21.042 --> 57:22.002
Wee!

57:25.489 --> 57:26.898
Hey, man what's this
I'm hearing about some kid

57:26.930 --> 57:29.010
from West Virginia
being sent over to Sea Breeze?

57:29.042 --> 57:30.193
What's that?

57:30.866 --> 57:31.826
Who told you that?

57:35.057 --> 57:36.530
All right. All right. All right.

57:36.561 --> 57:37.521
Full disclosure.

57:38.354 --> 57:40.434
Your man said six,
they offered nine.

57:40.466 --> 57:42.225
Come on, Vin,
I run a business here, man.

57:42.258 --> 57:43.922
- You know how it is.
- You run a business.

57:43.953 --> 57:45.649
- Yeah. You understand.
- You're all about the money.

57:45.681 --> 57:47.121
I mean... End of the day.

57:47.889 --> 57:50.001
I run a business.

57:50.034 --> 57:51.986
It's when you pick up the phone
and you call me, man.

57:52.017 --> 57:53.393
It's called a negotiation.

57:54.705 --> 57:55.794
Remember that.

57:55.826 --> 57:57.105
- All right.
- All right?

57:57.714 --> 57:59.921
- Touche. My bad.
- Okay.

58:01.137 --> 58:02.450
We still good for next week,
though, right?

58:02.481 --> 58:03.474
Solid.

58:03.506 --> 58:05.042
Sure?

58:05.073 --> 58:06.833
- All right. Come on, kid.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

58:07.889 --> 58:09.234
You remember the thing
in Tustin?

58:10.929 --> 58:11.889
Yeah.

58:12.689 --> 58:14.513
It's back.

58:14.546 --> 58:17.297
I thought after Orange County
we were done with that.

58:17.329 --> 58:19.602
<i>What happened
in Orange County?</i>

58:19.634 --> 58:21.329
<i>They got greedy,
is what happened.</i>

58:22.193 --> 58:23.666
<i>You see, a few years ago</i>

58:23.697 --> 58:27.441
<i>Naltrexone implants became the go-to
treatment for opiate addiction.</i>

58:27.474 --> 58:30.225
<i>These implants block the
opiate receptors in the brain,</i>

58:30.258 --> 58:32.913
<i>thus preventing
the ability to use opiates.</i>

58:32.945 --> 58:34.865
<i>Now, what some people
have begun doing</i>

58:34.898 --> 58:37.586
<i>is performing these implants
on anyone they can find.</i>

58:37.617 --> 58:38.961
<i>Clients at the
treatment centers,</i>

58:38.994 --> 58:41.457
<i>maybe even incentivizing
or paying someone</i>

58:41.489 --> 58:45.137
<i>who isn't an opiate addict
to get the procedure done.</i>

58:45.169 --> 58:49.490
<i>Each one of these implants
pays out $60,000.</i>

58:49.521 --> 58:52.049
<i>Most doctors can churn out
20 implants a day.</i>

58:52.466 --> 58:54.705
<i>Do the math.</i>

58:54.737 --> 58:57.585
Lot of money
floating around. Okay?

58:57.617 --> 58:59.601
The heat's off.
It's time to go back to work.

59:00.978 --> 59:02.130
All right.

59:02.162 --> 59:03.377
I've got an address.

59:05.010 --> 59:06.417
You be there at noon tomorrow.

59:09.746 --> 59:12.146
- Same money?
- Same. Everything's the same.

59:14.354 --> 59:15.953
Why don't you take
the kid here, man?

59:15.986 --> 59:18.129
Give him some lunch money.
Maybe a haircut.

59:18.162 --> 59:19.729
Yeah, definitely a haircut.

59:22.002 --> 59:23.505
All right, let's go.

59:23.537 --> 59:24.497
Hey, Wood.

59:25.425 --> 59:26.609
The shit with Sea Breeze, man,

59:26.642 --> 59:28.017
I don't wanna ever hear
that shit again. Okay?

59:28.050 --> 59:29.874
- All right. All right.
- All right? We're partners, man.

59:31.377 --> 59:32.337
My word, Vin.

59:35.186 --> 59:36.177
Utah.

59:36.209 --> 59:37.329
Welcome to the team.

59:41.265 --> 59:42.962
- Later, Vin.
- See you, man.

59:43.761 --> 59:44.721
See ya.

59:57.777 --> 59:59.570
Oh, shit.

59:59.601 --> 1:00:00.561
Yeah.

1:00:02.001 --> 1:00:02.961
Crazy, right?

1:00:04.977 --> 1:00:07.346
Just think, eight years ago
I was homeless.

1:00:09.362 --> 1:00:11.186
All right, man, come on.
Let me show you the best part.

1:00:17.522 --> 1:00:18.738
So, that's your room
over there.

1:00:24.561 --> 1:00:26.929
I mean, you know I could just
sleep on the couch, right?

1:00:26.961 --> 1:00:29.809
I don't want your Cajun ass
dirtying up my couch.

1:00:29.841 --> 1:00:31.922
That's yours
until you get on your feet.

1:00:31.953 --> 1:00:33.938
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1:00:38.642 --> 1:00:39.825
You know, people like us,

1:00:39.858 --> 1:00:41.457
we don't get too many
opportunities, to be honest, Utah.

1:00:42.482 --> 1:00:45.169
These people? Shit.

1:00:45.201 --> 1:00:46.578
They're going to get high
regardless.

1:00:48.177 --> 1:00:49.394
I just provide a service.

1:00:50.001 --> 1:00:51.345
Place some bodies, you know.

1:00:54.225 --> 1:00:56.082
Don't worry about all of that.
You get some rest, okay?

1:00:56.114 --> 1:00:58.034
Unpack. Talk to you
in the morning.

1:01:22.194 --> 1:01:23.505
What's up, Doc?

1:01:25.041 --> 1:01:26.513
Oh, you got to be Wood, right?

1:01:26.546 --> 1:01:27.506
Yes, I am.

1:01:28.785 --> 1:01:30.930
- This is Utah.
- Utah.

1:01:30.962 --> 1:01:33.329
So why don't we, uh...
Why don't we cut to the chase?

1:01:33.362 --> 1:01:34.737
Okay? I, uh...

1:01:36.273 --> 1:01:38.097
Tuesdays and Thursday mornings.

1:01:38.129 --> 1:01:39.793
Mornings are the best for me.

1:01:39.825 --> 1:01:42.673
And if we have overflow,
which hopefully we will,

1:01:42.705 --> 1:01:44.913
we go to my office in Torrance.

1:01:44.945 --> 1:01:46.706
How many can you manage
in a day?

1:01:48.882 --> 1:01:50.481
Twenty, give or take one or two.

1:01:50.513 --> 1:01:52.466
Depending on complications
or whatever, yeah.

1:01:52.497 --> 1:01:56.562
Listen, it's... it's a
relatively simple procedure.

1:01:56.594 --> 1:01:58.322
You cut right here.

1:01:58.353 --> 1:02:00.369
Okay, and... I'm sorry.

1:02:00.402 --> 1:02:02.418
And then... and then you
put the implant in.

1:02:02.450 --> 1:02:03.410
It's... it's...

1:02:04.274 --> 1:02:05.906
It's 101 shit.

1:02:06.450 --> 1:02:07.665
Yeah.

1:02:08.210 --> 1:02:09.873
Okay. All right.

1:02:09.905 --> 1:02:11.090
And, um, the billing?

1:02:11.121 --> 1:02:13.970
Billing. We bill for
abdominal surgery,

1:02:15.345 --> 1:02:18.705
and that's 60 grand
an implant, okay?

1:02:18.738 --> 1:02:21.169
And they come like clockwork.

1:02:21.201 --> 1:02:22.193
So we're good.

1:02:22.226 --> 1:02:24.081
Speaking of billing,

1:02:25.362 --> 1:02:27.057
this arrangement that we have

1:02:27.089 --> 1:02:29.138
it's going to be
a 50-50 split, right?

1:02:29.169 --> 1:02:30.929
Yeah. Straight down the middle.

1:02:30.962 --> 1:02:33.938
Okay, good. So, 50-50.

1:02:33.969 --> 1:02:34.929
Yeah.

1:02:35.666 --> 1:02:36.689
Oh, one last thing.

1:02:37.553 --> 1:02:38.642
What about the removals?

1:02:40.305 --> 1:02:41.744
Yeah.

1:02:41.778 --> 1:02:43.185
Get them coming
and going, right?

1:02:46.257 --> 1:02:47.634
Let's make
some fucking money.

1:02:47.666 --> 1:02:48.626
Make some money.

1:05:07.665 --> 1:05:08.625
Utah?

1:05:10.289 --> 1:05:12.113
Hey!

1:05:12.146 --> 1:05:13.969
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

1:05:14.001 --> 1:05:15.249
- How are you?
- Good.

1:05:15.282 --> 1:05:17.906
It's so crazy
to see you... here.

1:05:17.937 --> 1:05:19.346
- Yeah.
- Um, I...

1:05:19.377 --> 1:05:21.585
You okay?
You look kinda lost.

1:05:21.617 --> 1:05:23.762
I'm good.
Yeah, I am lost. Um...

1:05:24.529 --> 1:05:26.130
Just got a new place.

1:05:26.162 --> 1:05:29.297
So I'm, uh, trying to get
the basics, I guess.

1:05:29.329 --> 1:05:30.897
- You want some help?
- That'd be great.

1:05:30.930 --> 1:05:32.721
Okay. I got you.

1:05:32.754 --> 1:05:33.714
Come on.

1:05:34.641 --> 1:05:36.305
Um...

1:05:36.338 --> 1:05:38.162
So it's like brand, brand-new?

1:05:38.193 --> 1:05:39.185
Oh, yeah.

1:05:39.218 --> 1:05:43.250
So you need
one of everything?

1:05:43.281 --> 1:05:44.625
- I guess.
- Yeah, okay.

1:05:45.777 --> 1:05:47.441
What else?
Have you been working?

1:05:47.922 --> 1:05:49.393
Yeah, I found a job.

1:05:49.425 --> 1:05:51.441
Really? That's awesome.

1:05:51.921 --> 1:05:53.489
Stayin' sober?

1:05:53.522 --> 1:05:54.609
Coming up on my 90 days.

1:05:55.922 --> 1:05:57.425
Utah...

1:05:57.458 --> 1:06:01.009
That's fucking amazing.
Good for you.

1:06:01.041 --> 1:06:02.865
What meetings
have you been going to?

1:06:02.897 --> 1:06:04.977
Meetings.

1:06:05.009 --> 1:06:07.761
Oh, so you have
willpower, huh?

1:06:07.793 --> 1:06:09.713
Nah, I haven't really
had the urge yet.

1:06:09.746 --> 1:06:11.090
- So that's good, right?
- Yeah.

1:06:11.121 --> 1:06:12.689
Well, you're stronger
than me.

1:06:12.722 --> 1:06:14.577
I need a program
or I'm fucked.

1:06:15.345 --> 1:06:16.337
Uh, okay.

1:06:19.281 --> 1:06:20.273
I'm sold.

1:06:20.306 --> 1:06:21.362
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:06:21.393 --> 1:06:22.641
- It looks like you.
- It's great.

1:06:22.674 --> 1:06:23.697
I think it's gonna be great.

1:06:25.458 --> 1:06:27.089
It was really good
to see you.

1:06:27.121 --> 1:06:28.434
Maybe I'll see you around.

1:06:30.737 --> 1:06:32.561
Wait. May, um...

1:06:34.322 --> 1:06:35.569
Maybe you wanna...

1:06:36.722 --> 1:06:37.809
meet up sometime?

1:06:39.602 --> 1:06:41.361
Um...

1:06:41.393 --> 1:06:43.505
I'm actually not supposed
to see clients

1:06:43.538 --> 1:06:45.746
until they've been out
for two years.

1:06:45.777 --> 1:06:47.570
You know,
it's kind of the law.

1:06:48.594 --> 1:06:49.746
And, uh...

1:06:49.778 --> 1:06:51.986
You know, if we had to run
into each other again, like...

1:06:53.169 --> 1:06:54.321
I don't know, on accident?

1:06:54.354 --> 1:06:55.697
Well...

1:06:55.729 --> 1:07:01.041
I mean, if it was an accident then
I'd have plausible deniability.

1:07:01.074 --> 1:07:02.834
I mean, couldn't really
be prosecuted for that.

1:07:03.986 --> 1:07:04.946
Maybe it'll happen then.

1:07:05.618 --> 1:07:07.377
Yeah. Maybe.

1:07:07.409 --> 1:07:10.385
Maybe somewhere like
3rd & Colorado

1:07:10.418 --> 1:07:11.666
tomorrow night at 7:00 p.m.

1:07:12.690 --> 1:07:13.969
Maybe somewhere like that.

1:07:16.370 --> 1:07:17.457
Don't forget your broom.

1:07:24.242 --> 1:07:27.026
Yeah, boy, this is the life, huh?
It's good.

1:07:30.897 --> 1:07:33.169
Utah! What's up, homie?

1:07:33.201 --> 1:07:34.226
What's up?

1:07:34.257 --> 1:07:36.338
Come on and party with us, man.
We waiting on you.

1:07:36.369 --> 1:07:38.193
Aw, man.
I didn't bring my swim trunks.

1:07:38.610 --> 1:07:40.145
Aw, man.

1:07:40.178 --> 1:07:43.314
All right, I'll tell you what, get in
your drawers. We ain't gonna tell nobody.

1:07:45.105 --> 1:07:46.865
What do you think of the new clothes, man?
You like them?

1:07:46.898 --> 1:07:48.433
Cool man, you all right.

1:07:49.106 --> 1:07:51.698
Get some trunks.
Get in the pool.

1:07:51.729 --> 1:07:54.417
I met them two chicks on the beach.
Crazy, right?

1:08:00.498 --> 1:08:01.458
This ought to fit ya.

1:08:04.434 --> 1:08:07.410
Man, one of them bitches brought that
shit over here, man. Don't even trip.

1:08:07.442 --> 1:08:10.130
Ain't even that good, yo.

1:08:10.161 --> 1:08:12.882
Little stepped on, but...
it'll get you buzzed.

1:08:14.097 --> 1:08:15.057
Wanna try?

1:08:15.890 --> 1:08:16.914
Nah, man, I'm good.

1:08:18.386 --> 1:08:21.137
Come on, man, a little party
ain't gonna hurt nobody.

1:08:21.169 --> 1:08:22.961
I'm cool, man.
That's all you, baby.

1:08:24.049 --> 1:08:25.202
All right, suit yourself.

1:08:26.258 --> 1:08:28.242
Aah!

1:08:28.274 --> 1:08:30.129
Ooh!

1:08:31.025 --> 1:08:32.241
Yeah, man.

1:08:32.274 --> 1:08:35.762
All right, yo, let's go introduce
you to some of these ladies.

1:08:35.793 --> 1:08:39.026
You know, what?
I'm actually meeting a girl tonight.

1:08:39.057 --> 1:08:40.977
So I gotta stay on my game,
if you know what I mean.

1:08:43.698 --> 1:08:46.097
Well, I'm proud of you, man.
Look at you, bro.

1:08:46.129 --> 1:08:49.009
Ah, I'm fucking loving you, boy.

1:08:49.041 --> 1:08:51.410
- Man, all right, you good?
- Yeah.

1:08:51.441 --> 1:08:52.849
All right.

1:08:55.122 --> 1:08:56.082
Talk to you later.

1:09:03.090 --> 1:09:05.810
I wanna thank y'all
for comin' out here tonight.

1:09:05.841 --> 1:09:08.625
Now, I know that
none of you sorry motherfuckers

1:09:08.658 --> 1:09:12.146
wanna listen to me bitch about my
bullshit problems, so I'm gonna...

1:09:12.177 --> 1:09:16.209
try to take it easy
on you tonight.

1:09:16.242 --> 1:09:19.089
Because tonight
is a speaker meeting,

1:09:19.122 --> 1:09:21.009
and I have invited all the way
from Long Beach...

1:09:21.042 --> 1:09:22.577
- You made it.
- What is this?

1:09:22.609 --> 1:09:23.697
...my good friend Wayne here
to share his story with us.

1:09:23.729 --> 1:09:26.001
They have soup kitchen for hipsters?

1:09:26.034 --> 1:09:28.466
So let's give him a big
welcome, shall we, please? Thank you.

1:09:31.665 --> 1:09:32.625
Thanks, Lee.

1:09:33.810 --> 1:09:34.993
I'm Wayne.

1:09:35.025 --> 1:09:38.514
I'm a 5'11'' junkie with a God complex.

1:09:38.546 --> 1:09:40.274
Hi, Wayne.

1:09:40.305 --> 1:09:43.058
Thanks to all of you,
I have 10 years sober.

1:09:44.721 --> 1:09:46.481
I'm, uh, from the Midwest.

1:09:46.994 --> 1:09:49.074
Came in off the streets.

1:09:49.106 --> 1:09:51.537
My mother died of cancer.
Never really...

1:09:52.337 --> 1:09:53.393
knew my father.

1:09:54.770 --> 1:09:58.449
And, uh, I wasn't always
a drug addict, but...

1:09:58.482 --> 1:10:01.009
I never felt like
I belonged anywhere.

1:10:02.418 --> 1:10:05.009
Never really felt like
my skin fit.

1:10:06.705 --> 1:10:08.753
After I found drugs
and alcohol,

1:10:08.786 --> 1:10:11.633
all my insecurities
just went away.

1:10:14.417 --> 1:10:17.329
Everything was
in perfect harmony.

1:10:20.177 --> 1:10:21.169
Till it wasn't.

1:10:26.129 --> 1:10:30.354
All right, last thing we do
at every meeting is we pass out chips

1:10:31.089 --> 1:10:34.226
to mark milestones
in our recovery.

1:10:34.257 --> 1:10:35.410
So is there anyone here

1:10:35.441 --> 1:10:38.930
who's celebrating up to 90 days
of their recovery tonight?

1:10:38.961 --> 1:10:40.593
- Raise your hand.
- No.

1:10:40.625 --> 1:10:41.618
Boys and girls...

1:10:41.649 --> 1:10:43.281
Raise your hand,
or else I'm gonna do it for you.

1:10:43.313 --> 1:10:44.337
Shut up. Shut up.

1:10:44.369 --> 1:10:45.362
Going once.

1:10:45.810 --> 1:10:46.961
Goin' twice.

1:10:47.762 --> 1:10:49.425
Yeah, we have a winner!

1:10:49.458 --> 1:10:50.833
How many days?

1:10:50.865 --> 1:10:52.401
- Ninety.
- All right!

1:10:52.434 --> 1:10:54.162
Come on down.

1:11:03.665 --> 1:11:04.658
There you go.

1:11:04.689 --> 1:11:05.649
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:11:08.145 --> 1:11:10.770
Come on. There we go.

1:11:10.802 --> 1:11:12.146
Congratulations.

1:11:14.450 --> 1:11:15.410
Who are you?

1:11:15.857 --> 1:11:17.745
Oh, shit, uh...

1:11:17.777 --> 1:11:20.913
I'm Utah.
I'm a... drug addict.

1:11:20.945 --> 1:11:22.513
- Say hi to Utah.
- Hi, Utah.

1:11:23.825 --> 1:11:25.874
Um... 90 days.

1:11:26.642 --> 1:11:27.602
It's crazy.

1:11:28.369 --> 1:11:31.185
Uh, to be honest,
when I walked in,

1:11:31.217 --> 1:11:33.425
I didn't really know
what you people were about.

1:11:34.289 --> 1:11:35.249
But, Wayne...

1:11:37.106 --> 1:11:38.097
what you said...

1:11:40.434 --> 1:11:41.777
you told my story, man.

1:11:44.178 --> 1:11:47.025
And to see you up here
with 10 years, and happy...

1:11:48.529 --> 1:11:49.938
Well, I can't really
even fathom that.

1:11:51.122 --> 1:11:52.369
But it gives me hope, though.

1:11:55.505 --> 1:11:58.514
I guess I'm learning that I don't
have to do this all alone, so...

1:11:58.545 --> 1:12:00.498
thank you all for that.

1:12:00.530 --> 1:12:02.322
All right, Utah.

1:12:05.841 --> 1:12:08.306
It's funny I can't really
picture you doing drugs,

1:12:08.337 --> 1:12:09.777
or drinking
or, anything like that.

1:12:10.194 --> 1:12:11.186
Okay.

1:12:11.217 --> 1:12:12.914
You're quite normal.

1:12:14.417 --> 1:12:16.881
I don't even really know
what normal is, but...

1:12:18.386 --> 1:12:19.346
Uh...

1:12:21.137 --> 1:12:23.538
I promise you
I earned my seat.

1:12:23.570 --> 1:12:24.657
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

1:12:27.857 --> 1:12:30.290
Just because I have a
nine-to-five, and I get paid to...

1:12:30.321 --> 1:12:33.777
- Oh, is it something important?
- Work.

1:12:33.809 --> 1:12:36.050
Well, you can take it
if you need to.

1:12:36.081 --> 1:12:38.417
- I'm sorry...
- No, no, it...

1:12:38.898 --> 1:12:40.241
It's fine, really.

1:12:41.810 --> 1:12:44.145
- I gotta go...
- Come on. I'll walk you out.

1:12:45.201 --> 1:12:46.161
Come on.

1:12:52.881 --> 1:12:53.841
Wait.

1:12:54.833 --> 1:12:57.201
- Is this your car?
- Yeah.

1:12:57.938 --> 1:12:59.569
Marketing, huh?

1:13:00.593 --> 1:13:01.809
I had a really
nice time tonight.

1:13:05.361 --> 1:13:07.346
And, um...

1:13:07.377 --> 1:13:09.714
Thank you for showing me
that meeting, that was...

1:13:11.089 --> 1:13:12.049
surprisingly cool.

1:13:12.913 --> 1:13:14.865
Well, maybe I'll see you
there sometime.

1:13:15.249 --> 1:13:16.209
Yeah.

1:13:16.881 --> 1:13:17.873
I, uh...

1:13:19.665 --> 1:13:21.649
I think you might.

1:13:22.769 --> 1:13:25.842
Um...

1:13:25.874 --> 1:13:28.625
- Okay, I see how it is.
- Yeah. You know...

1:13:28.658 --> 1:13:30.257
Figured I'd give you
one of those and...

1:13:30.994 --> 1:13:32.529
if you need any help
you can...

1:13:33.458 --> 1:13:34.418
give me a call.

1:13:49.202 --> 1:13:50.353
Um...

1:13:51.858 --> 1:13:53.714
Yeah, if...

1:13:53.745 --> 1:13:55.794
If I have any friends
who need a...

1:13:56.817 --> 1:13:57.777
marketer...

1:13:58.770 --> 1:14:00.049
I'll have them call you.

1:14:25.298 --> 1:14:27.857
Here you go, Tee Tee.
I'm sorry I was late.

1:14:29.202 --> 1:14:30.386
Yeah, it's okay.

1:14:30.417 --> 1:14:31.889
There's a few waiting.

1:14:31.922 --> 1:14:32.913
Thanks, sweetie.

1:14:47.249 --> 1:14:48.209
Hey, Utah.

1:14:54.866 --> 1:14:55.826
What are you doing here?

1:14:56.849 --> 1:14:57.938
Wood didn't tell you?

1:14:59.121 --> 1:15:00.626
He's the one
who got me out here.

1:15:02.961 --> 1:15:03.921
What do you mean?

1:15:04.785 --> 1:15:06.386
Shit.

1:15:06.417 --> 1:15:08.625
The day you called me...

1:15:08.658 --> 1:15:12.945
later that night,
he gave me a call.

1:15:14.642 --> 1:15:16.753
Said he'd give me money
to go to treatment.

1:15:17.394 --> 1:15:18.641
Figured you knew.

1:15:23.121 --> 1:15:24.433
Forgot to mention that.

1:15:28.976 --> 1:15:30.482
You gonna give me my money?

1:15:39.218 --> 1:15:40.178
Here.

1:16:59.633 --> 1:17:01.457
Why don't you stay for a bit.

1:17:06.002 --> 1:17:07.730
We could have some fun.

1:17:08.850 --> 1:17:10.001
Aah!

1:18:12.722 --> 1:18:15.090
- Don't fucking grab me.
- You're high.

1:18:15.122 --> 1:18:19.698
Everyone here is fucking high.
You fucking stupid?

1:18:19.730 --> 1:18:22.674
I got a guy who's gonna take it out for a few more bucks later.

1:18:25.106 --> 1:18:26.577
Why do you fuckin' care?

1:18:39.537 --> 1:18:40.722
The fuck?

1:18:51.089 --> 1:18:53.169
Is that
the fuckin' cops, man?

1:18:59.282 --> 1:19:01.778
What the fuck?
We better still be gettin' paid.

1:19:20.625 --> 1:19:21.777
This isn't good.

1:19:22.706 --> 1:19:23.666
Fuck!

1:19:28.497 --> 1:19:29.778
All right, everybody out.

1:19:29.810 --> 1:19:31.313
Man, fuck you!

1:19:31.346 --> 1:19:32.498
Get the fuck out!

1:19:34.065 --> 1:19:35.025
I'll find you.

1:20:06.386 --> 1:20:09.266
- So exactly what did you see, anyway?
- I told you, man. Cops.

1:20:09.297 --> 1:20:11.505
What kinda cops? What?

1:20:11.537 --> 1:20:15.057
Undercover? SWAT? Sheriffs?
What kind of fuckin' cops?

1:20:15.090 --> 1:20:16.818
The fuck if I know!
Fuckin' cops.

1:20:19.761 --> 1:20:21.489
All right.

1:20:21.522 --> 1:20:23.378
I spoke to Vin,
he gonna sort it all out.

1:20:23.409 --> 1:20:25.009
Man, what the fuck
does that mean?

1:20:26.193 --> 1:20:27.153
Wait, wait, wait.

1:20:27.953 --> 1:20:29.713
You got something else
you wanna say?

1:20:32.337 --> 1:20:34.034
Man, why didn't you
tell me about Opal?

1:20:36.114 --> 1:20:37.074
What about her?

1:20:38.513 --> 1:20:40.562
You acted like
she came out here on her own.

1:20:40.593 --> 1:20:43.634
Not that you fuckin' called her
and fuckin' brokered her!

1:20:45.618 --> 1:20:47.985
That young bitch
is a junkie, man.

1:20:48.017 --> 1:20:49.394
You don't know by now?

1:20:49.425 --> 1:20:52.017
What, you're also
a dope dealer, too?

1:20:52.049 --> 1:20:54.737
She's over there
coppin' from Miss Tee.

1:20:54.769 --> 1:20:58.002
She gonna get high regardless.
Okay? Regardless.

1:20:58.034 --> 1:20:59.505
It might as well be me.

1:21:00.657 --> 1:21:02.673
You know what? My bad.

1:21:02.994 --> 1:21:04.689
I'm sorry.

1:21:04.722 --> 1:21:09.362
I'm sorry for ever pickin' your
stupid ass up off the street!

1:21:09.393 --> 1:21:13.106
The clothes, the money,
the cars, the house!

1:21:13.137 --> 1:21:15.570
Oh, and by the way,
you can thank me later

1:21:15.602 --> 1:21:17.490
for nobody finding
your stupid ass

1:21:17.522 --> 1:21:19.826
dead in a fuckin' hotel in Ohio.

1:21:21.585 --> 1:21:22.833
Get the fuck outta here, man!

1:21:40.562 --> 1:21:42.002
I saw something in you.

1:21:46.130 --> 1:21:47.954
I still see something
in you, Utah.

1:21:51.377 --> 1:21:53.361
I mean, come on, man.
Look around, bro.

1:21:54.834 --> 1:21:56.145
Look how we living.

1:21:58.097 --> 1:22:01.873
Me and you got more money than
both our deadbeat dads ever had.

1:22:05.169 --> 1:22:07.025
We brothers.
Me and you the same.

1:22:07.058 --> 1:22:08.786
What you wanna fight me for?

1:22:08.817 --> 1:22:11.186
Huh? Over that dumb bitch?
She don't love you.

1:22:16.722 --> 1:22:17.682
Bro, we fam.

1:22:18.609 --> 1:22:19.569
It's me and you.

1:22:23.025 --> 1:22:24.113
Come here, man.
Come here.

1:22:25.041 --> 1:22:26.001
Come on.

1:22:28.370 --> 1:22:29.330
Hey.

1:22:32.145 --> 1:22:33.905
I'ma call Vin.

1:22:33.938 --> 1:22:35.633
He gonna take care
of all of this.

1:22:37.041 --> 1:22:38.642
- All right?
- All right.

1:22:58.161 --> 1:22:59.537
Okay.

1:22:59.569 --> 1:23:00.465
Why are you guys here?

1:23:00.497 --> 1:23:02.834
Hey, yo, Doc,
what the fuck happened, man?

1:23:02.865 --> 1:23:05.010
- What? About the nurse?
- Yes.

1:23:05.042 --> 1:23:07.185
I spoke to Vin
about that, okay?

1:23:07.217 --> 1:23:08.754
It was a nurse, she talked to a
friend, complained she...

1:23:08.786 --> 1:23:11.634
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Don't worry
about talking to Vin, you talk to me.

1:23:11.666 --> 1:23:12.977
What happened, bro?

1:23:13.682 --> 1:23:16.113
I fired her. Okay?
She's gone.

1:23:16.145 --> 1:23:19.025
She's probably illegal anyway.
So we got nothing to worry about.

1:23:19.058 --> 1:23:22.002
So... so what are we supposed to do now?
Answer me that.

1:23:22.034 --> 1:23:25.617
So what do we do now is you take
junior here and get the fuck out, okay?

1:23:25.649 --> 1:23:27.377
And we just chill
for a little bit,

1:23:27.409 --> 1:23:30.642
and we alternate between
the Torrance office, that's all.

1:23:30.674 --> 1:23:32.786
This is what goes along
with doing this business.

1:23:41.169 --> 1:23:43.025
All right.

1:23:43.058 --> 1:23:45.873
I will talk to Vin,
see what he says.

1:23:45.905 --> 1:23:48.210
Yeah. And when
you talk to Vin,

1:23:48.242 --> 1:23:49.938
and I've given this
a lot of thought...

1:23:51.026 --> 1:23:52.337
It's a new arrangement.

1:23:52.369 --> 1:23:54.738
70% for me,
30% for you guys.

1:23:57.201 --> 1:23:58.193
Excuse me?

1:23:58.226 --> 1:23:59.313
No, excuse me.

1:23:59.345 --> 1:24:01.617
I got a degree up
on my fuckin' wall.

1:24:01.650 --> 1:24:04.305
All right? So I'm tired of
playin' second fiddle to a...

1:24:04.338 --> 1:24:06.386
Seriously, two fuckin' junkies.

1:24:06.417 --> 1:24:09.297
So you can take that back
to your fuckin' boss now.

1:24:09.330 --> 1:24:11.889
And stop showin' up here
without an appointment.

1:24:17.489 --> 1:24:18.482
Man.

1:24:18.513 --> 1:24:20.786
Now, can you please
leave my clinic?

1:24:20.817 --> 1:24:23.345
And take the retard Mongoloid
with you, please.

1:24:23.378 --> 1:24:24.977
Come on, Junior,
get the fuck up.

1:24:31.218 --> 1:24:32.337
Get up, kid, let's go.

1:24:41.970 --> 1:24:43.217
Fuck you!

1:25:03.506 --> 1:25:04.466
What happened?

1:25:11.409 --> 1:25:12.594
What the fuck did he do?

1:25:13.521 --> 1:25:14.674
I'm sorry, man,
I fucked up.

1:25:14.706 --> 1:25:17.361
No, man. No, man, don't apologize.
As long as you're okay.

1:25:20.306 --> 1:25:22.161
Just gotta be really smart
about this now, man.

1:25:26.769 --> 1:25:28.433
You got a place to take him?

1:25:28.466 --> 1:25:30.193
Yeah. Yeah, I know a spot.

1:25:30.225 --> 1:25:31.538
- You know a spot?
- Yeah.

1:25:32.754 --> 1:25:35.121
You got about five hours
before the sun comes up.

1:25:35.153 --> 1:25:36.434
All right?

1:25:36.465 --> 1:25:38.577
When you finish with this,
I want you to burn both your clothes.

1:25:39.345 --> 1:25:40.977
- Everything.
- Okay.

1:25:41.009 --> 1:25:41.937
- All right?
- Yeah.

1:25:41.969 --> 1:25:44.210
And once you're done,
I want you to pack a bag

1:25:44.241 --> 1:25:46.769
and I want you to get the fuck
out of here for a little bit.

1:25:46.802 --> 1:25:49.137
I'll call my guys tomorrow,
and I'll see what's what.

1:25:49.170 --> 1:25:50.609
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1:25:58.514 --> 1:25:59.474
What about the kid?

1:26:01.009 --> 1:26:02.129
He gonna be a problem?

1:26:02.162 --> 1:26:04.209
'Cause he's the only one
who saw you do this.

1:26:05.042 --> 1:26:06.162
Right?

1:26:06.194 --> 1:26:08.882
And he's the one who's been
running the implants, right?

1:26:08.913 --> 1:26:10.802
- And he knows everything.
- Look, I hear you.

1:26:16.754 --> 1:26:18.289
All right,
I'll handle things on my end.

1:26:18.321 --> 1:26:19.602
You just make sure
this body stays gone.

1:26:20.690 --> 1:26:21.746
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1:26:27.441 --> 1:26:28.401
How are you doing, kid?

1:26:30.033 --> 1:26:32.018
- Cool.
- You cool?

1:26:32.049 --> 1:26:33.713
I mean, did this fuck you up
a little bit?

1:26:34.994 --> 1:26:35.954
Nah.

1:26:38.961 --> 1:26:41.426
I like this fucking kid.

1:26:41.457 --> 1:26:43.346
Utah, get in the car.
We got somewhere we gotta be.

1:26:45.842 --> 1:26:46.993
See you later, Vin.

1:26:47.601 --> 1:26:48.561
You just relax, man.

1:27:13.554 --> 1:27:14.514
Be right back.

1:28:11.601 --> 1:28:12.882
Man, you think
this is deep enough?

1:28:16.466 --> 1:28:17.682
Yeah, it's deep enough.

1:28:27.474 --> 1:28:28.434
You okay, man?

1:28:34.002 --> 1:28:34.962
Yeah, I'm good.

1:28:36.177 --> 1:28:39.026
Come on, let's bury this body.

1:28:45.393 --> 1:28:46.674
Burn these
fucking clothes.

1:29:13.233 --> 1:29:14.961
I should have told you
about Opal.

1:29:22.194 --> 1:29:23.154
I should've told you.

1:29:26.162 --> 1:29:28.401
You know she's gone,
though, right?

1:29:28.946 --> 1:29:29.906
I mean...

1:29:31.281 --> 1:29:33.073
Just ain't no saving
some people.

1:29:38.001 --> 1:29:38.961
Yeah, I know.

1:29:43.122 --> 1:29:45.170
Shouldn't have been doing
that coke around you either.

1:29:47.569 --> 1:29:49.041
I can't have you going back.

1:29:51.122 --> 1:29:52.818
You got your whole life
ahead of you.

1:30:02.929 --> 1:30:05.937
I never meant for none
of that shit to happen, man.

1:30:06.386 --> 1:30:07.346
Yeah, I know.

1:30:12.529 --> 1:30:13.682
People like that...

1:30:14.994 --> 1:30:17.585
been talking down to me
my whole life.

1:30:20.690 --> 1:30:22.129
He's no better than us.

1:30:23.538 --> 1:30:25.425
He's just a crook
in a white coat.

1:30:30.098 --> 1:30:31.761
How the hell
did I find you, man?

1:30:56.241 --> 1:30:57.266
That's adorable.

1:31:00.785 --> 1:31:01.970
Hey, is that...

1:31:02.834 --> 1:31:05.201
Is that who I think it is?

1:31:10.129 --> 1:31:12.049
You fucking dog.

1:31:12.081 --> 1:31:13.202
What are you doing here?

1:31:20.337 --> 1:31:21.521
Meet me in the back.

1:31:47.633 --> 1:31:49.041
You never stop surprising me.

1:31:51.569 --> 1:31:53.522
One day you got to let me
know how that was.

1:31:55.281 --> 1:31:57.650
I mean, she's a bit natural
for me, but I'm still curious.

1:32:00.113 --> 1:32:02.610
Yeah. How long's Wood
letting you stay here?

1:32:02.642 --> 1:32:04.338
He says as long as I need to.

1:32:06.866 --> 1:32:07.826
He's a good guy.

1:32:09.297 --> 1:32:10.257
How are you doing?

1:32:12.529 --> 1:32:13.521
I'm all right.

1:32:13.553 --> 1:32:15.858
Yeah? You sure?

1:32:15.890 --> 1:32:17.553
You know, Wood said
you handled yourself real well.

1:32:19.569 --> 1:32:21.105
Hey, hey, hey, hey, man.

1:32:21.681 --> 1:32:23.345
That's good.

1:32:23.378 --> 1:32:25.233
That's good. There's not
a lot of people that, uh...

1:32:26.097 --> 1:32:28.178
can make something
of themselves, you know?

1:32:28.209 --> 1:32:31.058
You got that. You got that thing, man.
You hear me?

1:32:31.089 --> 1:32:32.049
Yeah.

1:32:35.250 --> 1:32:37.521
You didn't say shit to her
about anything, did you?

1:32:37.553 --> 1:32:38.353
Man, you think I'm stupid?

1:32:38.385 --> 1:32:40.754
No, I don't think
you're stupid, man.

1:32:40.785 --> 1:32:42.674
You're anything but stupid.

1:32:43.794 --> 1:32:45.458
She shouldn't even know
I was here.

1:32:45.489 --> 1:32:46.610
That's... That's the truth.

1:32:46.641 --> 1:32:48.049
Why are you here?

1:32:50.514 --> 1:32:52.913
I just want to make sure
you're being careful.

1:32:52.946 --> 1:32:54.705
What... What does that mean?

1:32:56.274 --> 1:32:58.002
Well, it means I think you
should take a trip, you know,

1:32:58.034 --> 1:33:00.210
- for like, a week or so until I get... I get...
- No. No...

1:33:00.242 --> 1:33:02.001
No, listen to me. Listen.
Hey, hey, hey.

1:33:02.034 --> 1:33:03.698
Until I get a handle
on this shit,

1:33:03.729 --> 1:33:06.225
make sure it blows over.
You cool?

1:33:10.289 --> 1:33:12.113
What? What? What? Is it her?

1:33:13.137 --> 1:33:14.258
She's not going anywhere.

1:33:14.289 --> 1:33:15.793
She not going
anywhere, man. Just...

1:33:15.825 --> 1:33:18.258
You just tell her you gotta go and take
care of some bullshit business at home

1:33:18.290 --> 1:33:19.953
for a while, all right?

1:33:21.266 --> 1:33:23.729
Hey, look at me.

1:33:23.762 --> 1:33:25.617
Everything is fine.

1:33:25.649 --> 1:33:26.930
Everything is fine.

1:33:26.961 --> 1:33:29.010
She is not going anywhere,
I promise you that.

1:33:29.042 --> 1:33:30.513
Wood already left earlier, okay?

1:33:30.545 --> 1:33:32.690
I just think
this is a smart thing to do.

1:33:32.721 --> 1:33:35.121
It is. It's a smart thing to do.

1:33:35.153 --> 1:33:37.905
And you two could... You could...
You could have sex on FaceTime

1:33:37.937 --> 1:33:39.506
or whatever the fuck you guys do.

1:33:39.537 --> 1:33:41.937
- She'll love it. She'll love it.
- All right, all right.

1:33:41.969 --> 1:33:43.761
All right? You're family, man.

1:33:44.337 --> 1:33:45.330
You are family.

1:33:45.362 --> 1:33:47.090
I'm gonna take care of you.
You understand that?

1:33:48.785 --> 1:33:50.066
Okay?

1:33:50.097 --> 1:33:52.977
Now I'm gonna take off.
I'm gonna send somebody by here later.

1:33:53.010 --> 1:33:54.609
And you need to be gone.

1:33:55.698 --> 1:33:56.721
You understand me?

1:33:56.754 --> 1:33:58.097
I need you gone.

1:33:59.345 --> 1:34:00.434
- Okay.
- All right.

1:34:00.465 --> 1:34:01.490
- All right.
- I'm gonna call you later.

1:34:01.521 --> 1:34:02.610
- I'll stay in touch.
- Okay.

1:34:02.642 --> 1:34:03.793
All right?

1:34:04.338 --> 1:34:05.298
All right?

1:34:05.809 --> 1:34:07.601
Sexting, man, sexting.

1:34:28.049 --> 1:34:29.873
Where are you going?

1:34:29.906 --> 1:34:31.953
I got to...
I got to leave for a few days.

1:34:33.713 --> 1:34:34.737
Is everything okay?

1:34:34.769 --> 1:34:36.914
Yeah. Just, uh, work stuff.

1:34:43.505 --> 1:34:45.137
What's going on in that head?

1:34:51.537 --> 1:34:53.298
Well...

1:34:53.330 --> 1:34:55.154
maybe you'll tell me
when you get back.

1:34:57.362 --> 1:34:58.545
I'm gonna miss you.

1:35:01.586 --> 1:35:03.313
I forgot to give you this.

1:35:05.265 --> 1:35:06.449
Well, I didn't really
need it back.

1:35:06.482 --> 1:35:08.209
I mean, this thing is,
like, ancient.

1:35:08.241 --> 1:35:10.674
You're laughing. But it saved me when I was in there.

1:35:10.706 --> 1:35:11.697
Oh, yeah?

1:35:11.730 --> 1:35:14.514
Well, good, because you
definitely needed saving.

1:35:15.345 --> 1:35:16.434
Not anymore.

1:35:16.466 --> 1:35:18.065
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

1:35:18.098 --> 1:35:20.274
Because I've got you now.

1:35:20.306 --> 1:35:21.297
My savior.

1:35:21.330 --> 1:35:22.706
Stupid.

1:35:28.754 --> 1:35:30.738
- Come back soon, okay?
- Okay.

1:36:26.865 --> 1:36:28.497
- How you doing, hon?
- Fine.

1:36:28.946 --> 1:36:30.098
Can I help you?

1:36:32.241 --> 1:36:33.681
A pack of lights, please.

1:36:42.449 --> 1:36:43.409
Who's that?

1:36:44.145 --> 1:36:45.522
My niece.

1:36:45.554 --> 1:36:48.626
Leukemia. I don't know why
God lets these things happen.

1:37:02.898 --> 1:37:04.625
I don't know. I hope it helps.

1:37:33.810 --> 1:37:34.993
Hey.

1:37:35.025 --> 1:37:36.242
<i>How are you doing?</i>

1:37:37.682 --> 1:37:38.833
I'm all right.

1:37:41.490 --> 1:37:44.913
I haven't... I haven't really
felt right since I've been back.

1:37:46.641 --> 1:37:47.601
It's been rough.

1:37:48.753 --> 1:37:50.097
<i>You ready to come back
to work?</i>

1:37:54.897 --> 1:37:56.562
I think so.

1:37:56.594 --> 1:37:58.674
<i>Good. That's what I wanna hear.</i>

1:37:58.706 --> 1:38:01.265
<i>I got someone
for you to pick up out there.</i>

1:38:01.298 --> 1:38:03.857
<i>Get him on a plane,
and I'll pick you guys up tonight.</i>

1:38:05.105 --> 1:38:07.089
All right.
Just text me the address.

1:38:07.122 --> 1:38:09.938
<i>Will do. Be safe, you.</i>

1:38:12.978 --> 1:38:13.938
Before we go in...

1:38:15.729 --> 1:38:17.714
do you have anything on you
I need to know about?

1:38:19.794 --> 1:38:20.754
Yeah.

1:38:24.402 --> 1:38:27.857
Well, you better do it now,
because this is it.

1:42:32.625 --> 1:42:34.513
<i>I guess
the real question is this...</i>

1:42:34.545 --> 1:42:36.657
<i>How do you end
a never ending story?</i>

1:42:37.617 --> 1:42:39.890
<i>That's for you all to decide.</i>

1:42:39.921 --> 1:42:42.289
<i>But you'll never do
a goddamn thing about it.</i>

1:42:43.569 --> 1:42:45.777
So, until then,

1:42:45.810 --> 1:42:48.465
if you or a loved one
is struggling with addiction...

1:42:50.129 --> 1:42:51.185
give me a call.
