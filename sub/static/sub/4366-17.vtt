00:02.425 --> 00:04.709
You are being watched.

00:04.711 --> 00:07.145
The government
has a secret system--

00:07.147 --> 00:11.567
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.568 --> 00:14.052
I know because I built it.

00:14.054 --> 00:16.438
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:16.440 --> 00:18.207
but it sees everything...

00:18.209 --> 00:20.993
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people,

00:20.995 --> 00:22.561
people like you,

00:22.563 --> 00:26.164
crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:26.166 --> 00:29.585
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:29.587 --> 00:31.453
But I needed a partner--

00:31.455 --> 00:34.072
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

00:34.074 --> 00:38.293
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:38.295 --> 00:40.078
You will never find us.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.247
But victim or perpetrator,

00:42.249 --> 00:45.100
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

Did you hear? Moretti's
getting out of the slammer.

00:54.745 --> 00:57.446
Moretti?
Do you think Elias knows?

00:57.448 --> 00:59.931
Kidding me?
I think Elias arranged it.

00:59.933 --> 01:02.150
Wants him out in the open.

Don't tell me
you're here for Moretti.

01:30.130 --> 01:32.814
How did you know
he was being released?

01:33.850 --> 01:35.467
Should have guessed.

01:35.469 --> 01:37.119
Whenever you show up,

01:37.121 --> 01:40.238
trouble's right
around the corner.

01:40.240 --> 01:43.609
What's your plan, Carter?

01:43.611 --> 01:45.577
I got authority to offer
Moretti protection.

01:45.579 --> 01:47.496
In exchange,
he tells us how to get

01:47.498 --> 01:49.814
New York's
public enemy number one.

01:49.816 --> 01:51.416
His own son.

01:51.418 --> 01:56.371
His own son Elias.

02:01.594 --> 02:03.178
You there, Finch?

Not for long.

Administration two months ago

02:15.275 --> 02:18.276
to a woman named Leila Smith.

02:18.278 --> 02:21.146
Either a new citizen
or a case of identity fraud.

02:21.148 --> 02:23.899
All I could find
was a work address.

02:23.901 --> 02:26.451
We're working
Moretti's number, Finch.

02:26.453 --> 02:28.186
I need you at HQ.

Hey.

02:40.366 --> 02:43.201
Carter, NYPD.
Remember me?

02:45.339 --> 02:47.556
You know Elias
is looking for you.

02:47.558 --> 02:50.092
- I don't see him.
- Not yet.

02:50.094 --> 02:52.394
But I could put you
somewhere safe,

02:52.396 --> 02:56.014
try to keep you alive.

02:56.016 --> 02:57.349
Now I remember you now.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.685
You're the one Elias
wanted to kill.

02:59.687 --> 03:02.104
The cop who's on her own.

03:02.106 --> 03:06.191

03:52.906 --> 03:56.575
You're a patient.

03:59.962 --> 04:01.613
Any idea where he's going?

04:01.615 --> 04:04.232
He used to own
a house out here.

04:07.387 --> 04:10.889
Hello, I'm Dr. Tillman,
here to see Leila Smith.

04:10.891 --> 04:14.559
Dr. Adalian asked me to check
the status of her bronchitis.

04:14.561 --> 04:16.894
She's pretty well
over that by now.

04:16.897 --> 04:20.482
Nonetheless.
Do you have her chart for me?

04:22.017 --> 04:24.803
[Key card system beeps]

04:32.412 --> 04:33.645
No parents listed.

04:33.647 --> 04:35.831
Oh, Leila's a safe-haven baby.

04:35.833 --> 04:38.083
Dr. Adalian himself found her
outside the clinic.

04:38.085 --> 04:39.334
So who applied
for her social security number?

04:39.336 --> 04:40.919
That was me.

04:40.921 --> 04:43.371
I wanted to be sure the state
knew who Leila was,

04:43.373 --> 04:45.006
even if her own parents
didn't care.

04:45.008 --> 04:46.842
Normally she'd be given up
for adoption by now,

04:46.844 --> 04:50.662
but she had medical issues
like her bronchitis.

04:50.664 --> 04:52.464
She'll find a home soon.

04:52.466 --> 04:55.667
Thank you, nurse.

would want to hurt you?

05:19.042 --> 05:21.710
We're here for Leila Smith.

Here to transfer her

I have a situation.

05:33.674 --> 05:36.391
Me too.
I have to get back to you.

05:36.393 --> 05:41.429
This way.

05:44.767 --> 05:46.985
Looks like an accident.

05:46.987 --> 05:48.720
Go around them.

05:48.722 --> 05:50.939
Please, can you help us?

05:50.941 --> 05:52.073
Keep going.

06:30.731 --> 06:32.263
- I heard what happened.
- [Sighs]

06:32.265 --> 06:34.733
You're very lucky she
was there, Mr. Moretti.

06:34.735 --> 06:37.702
Yeah.
Who are you?

06:37.704 --> 06:39.604
Detective Szymanski.

06:39.606 --> 06:43.458
Another cop.

06:43.460 --> 06:45.276
Do I have to stay here?

06:45.278 --> 06:46.912
You're a free man, Gianni.

06:46.914 --> 06:49.748
You can walk out of here
and into a bullet anytime,

06:49.750 --> 06:54.169
or you can stay and help us get
Elias before he gets you.

07:04.397 --> 07:07.599
[Sighs]

07:10.803 --> 07:14.940
A mafia don in hiding.

07:14.942 --> 07:17.275
You plan on clearing this
with your bosses?

07:17.277 --> 07:18.660
It's already cleared.

07:18.662 --> 07:20.612
Elias doesn't own
the whole department--

07:20.614 --> 07:21.980
Not yet.

07:21.982 --> 07:24.983
Still a few good cops
like Szymanski in there,

07:24.985 --> 07:26.618
who want Elias taken down

07:26.620 --> 07:29.120
and think Moretti is
the best way to do it.

07:29.122 --> 07:32.090
Anyway...

07:32.092 --> 07:33.091
Thank you.

07:33.093 --> 07:36.962
You're welcome.

07:36.964 --> 07:41.165
Stay out of trouble.

07:43.636 --> 07:46.170
Hey, Finch.
How's it going?

07:46.172 --> 07:47.522
Oh...

07:47.524 --> 07:49.858
It's going.

07:49.860 --> 07:52.143
- What about Moretti?
- Elias had

07:52.145 --> 07:53.945
a getting-out-of-jail party
planned.

07:53.947 --> 07:56.448
We crashed it.

07:56.450 --> 07:59.985
What happened
with the other number, Finch?

07:59.987 --> 08:01.619
Cat got your tongue?

08:01.621 --> 08:05.123
I'm afraid I may have done
something rather rash.

08:05.125 --> 08:07.993
What do you mean by "rash"?

08:07.995 --> 08:11.997
[Coos]

08:27.052 --> 08:28.886
Is this one of your ties,
Finch?

08:28.888 --> 08:31.923
I hope you gave her some food
and not just your hand-me-downs.

08:31.925 --> 08:34.225
Chicken and prunes
is her favorite.

08:34.227 --> 08:36.760
Sounds, um, disgusting.

08:36.763 --> 08:39.764
But why on earth would anyone
want to kill her?

08:39.765 --> 08:41.631
[Coos]

08:41.634 --> 08:43.484
Somehow I don't see anyone
planning a murder here.

08:43.486 --> 08:47.488
My guess is that, if they were
successful in kidnapping her,

08:47.490 --> 08:49.941
they'd smuggle her
out of the country

08:49.943 --> 08:51.275
and dump her in an orphanage.

08:51.277 --> 08:53.494
Somewhere where
babies are plentiful

08:53.496 --> 08:55.163
and birth records aren't.

08:55.165 --> 08:57.248
But why do they want
to get rid of her?

08:57.250 --> 08:58.616
She might be evidence
of an affair,

08:58.618 --> 09:00.985
or she might be
an obstacle to someone

09:00.987 --> 09:02.787
getting a big, fat legacy.

09:02.789 --> 09:05.489
As for who they are,
I have no idea.

09:05.491 --> 09:08.092
But since she kept me up
all night,

09:08.094 --> 09:10.595
I looked into
the clinic's finances.

09:10.597 --> 09:12.430
They received a big gift.

09:12.432 --> 09:15.566
$50,000 just about the time
Leila was born

09:15.568 --> 09:17.501
and $10,000 every month
since then.

09:17.503 --> 09:18.936
Who's the donor?

09:18.938 --> 09:21.355
Anonymous.

09:21.357 --> 09:25.342
I sent the clinic a sternly
worded email from the IRS

09:25.344 --> 09:27.645
demanding the donor's
tax ID number

09:27.647 --> 09:29.564
and threatening to review
their charitable status

09:29.566 --> 09:31.816
if they didn't answer quickly.
We'll see how that works.

09:31.818 --> 09:33.901
[Computer beeps]

09:33.903 --> 09:36.738
Uh-oh.
Amber alert.

09:36.740 --> 09:39.907
"Baby kidnapped from
St. Raymond's clinic last night.

09:39.909 --> 09:43.628
Suspect is a short man
with mousy hair

09:43.630 --> 09:45.997
and thick glasses."

09:45.999 --> 09:49.417
It's not very flattering, Finch,
but better than the picture.

09:49.419 --> 09:52.086
It's no wonder they never
catch anybody with these things.

09:52.088 --> 09:53.721
You think Carter can piggyback
the police investigation?

09:53.723 --> 09:55.089
I'll ask her.

09:55.091 --> 09:59.710
You can spend some quality time
with Leila.

Has Mr. Moretti given you
anything on Elias?

10:06.986 --> 10:12.723
Not yet, but, um,
we're working on him.

10:12.725 --> 10:14.692
Who you buying that stuff for?

10:14.694 --> 10:17.528
That's why I wanted
to talk to you.

10:17.530 --> 10:19.514
A baby went missing
from a clinic

10:19.516 --> 10:21.616
in Washington Heights
last night.

10:21.618 --> 10:24.502
[Scoffs] Missing?
It was stolen...

10:24.504 --> 10:27.338
By some weird-looki--

10:27.340 --> 10:28.339
No.

10:28.341 --> 10:29.624
You didn't.

10:29.626 --> 10:32.176
She was in imminent danger
of kidnap.

10:32.178 --> 10:34.245
So <i>you</i> kidnapped her?

10:34.247 --> 10:36.013
You know there's an amber alert
out on you.

10:36.015 --> 10:39.183
Yes, and that's why
we need your help.

10:39.185 --> 10:42.970
Help?
I should arrest you.

10:42.972 --> 10:44.689
Where's the baby anyway?

10:44.691 --> 10:47.942
Leila's safe.
She's with John.

10:47.944 --> 10:51.445
John? John?
You trust him with a baby?

10:51.447 --> 10:53.648
I realize it's not ideal.

10:53.650 --> 10:56.217
So the sooner
we can resolve this, the better.

10:56.219 --> 10:57.935
What do you want me to do?

10:57.937 --> 10:59.954
Apart from not arresting you.

10:59.956 --> 11:01.622
Go to the clinic.

11:01.624 --> 11:04.158
See what you can find out
about Leila's parents.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.327
I heard she was
a safe-haven baby.

11:06.329 --> 11:08.212
Clinic's not going to have
that information.

11:08.214 --> 11:10.381
I think they know
more than they claim.

11:10.383 --> 11:11.749
Talk to a nurse Abbot.

11:11.751 --> 11:13.417
She seemed especially fond
of Leila.

11:13.419 --> 11:16.787
Congratulations.

11:29.352 --> 11:31.602
Did you hear Gianni Moretti
got out of prison yesterday

11:31.604 --> 11:33.654
then vanished?

11:33.656 --> 11:36.107
All state police found
was five dead goombas.

11:36.109 --> 11:38.075
Mobsters killing each other--
How tragic.

11:38.077 --> 11:41.645
Except it wasn't
just mobsters.

11:41.647 --> 11:45.149
Your partner was there too.

11:45.151 --> 11:46.417
Carter?

11:46.419 --> 11:48.836
Looks like she
and a couple of cowboys

11:48.838 --> 11:52.456
got some kind of rinky-dink
off-book operation.

11:52.458 --> 11:53.457
They've hidden Moretti.

11:53.459 --> 11:56.994
We want to find out where.

your fingers in all the pies.

12:03.720 --> 12:07.388
You are one of the pies,
Fusco.

12:07.390 --> 12:11.675
Find out where
she's got Moretti stashed.

12:18.033 --> 12:19.951
[Sighs] Like I told
the other detectives,

12:19.953 --> 12:21.352
we don't know
about the parents.

12:21.354 --> 12:23.487
Leila was just left
outside the clinic.

12:23.489 --> 12:26.190
Was there anything found
on Leila?

12:26.192 --> 12:28.159
I'm Dr. Adalian.
Who are you?

12:28.161 --> 12:30.578
- Detective Carter, SVU.
- Detective.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.163
As I'm sure
nurse Abbot explained,

12:32.165 --> 12:33.631
we don't know
where Leila came from.

12:33.633 --> 12:35.166
You must have kept something.

12:35.168 --> 12:36.918
Like, what about her clothes,
her blankets?

12:36.920 --> 12:38.152
No.

12:38.154 --> 12:40.204
The, uh, safe-haven law
was designed

12:40.206 --> 12:43.975
to protect newborns,
not prosecute their parents.

12:43.977 --> 12:45.393
It's not our job
to hunt people down.

12:45.395 --> 12:46.494
Thank you.

12:46.496 --> 12:48.379
I'm sorry.

12:48.381 --> 12:51.349
Excuse me.

12:51.351 --> 12:52.900
All I care about is Leila.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.736
If you can think of anything,
call me.

12:55.738 --> 13:00.441
Please.

13:00.443 --> 13:01.776
[Coos]

13:01.778 --> 13:03.911
This flap here,
that flap there, see?

13:03.913 --> 13:05.363
Neat and simple.

13:05.365 --> 13:09.000
I see your time
at MIT wasn't wasted.

13:09.002 --> 13:10.451
[Giggles] [Computer beeps]

13:10.453 --> 13:12.336
Oh, excellent.
The accountants

13:12.338 --> 13:13.570
at the clinic have coughed up

13:13.572 --> 13:15.506
the tax ID numbers
of their donor.

13:15.508 --> 13:18.542
Nothing like a fear of the IRS
to produce results.

13:18.544 --> 13:22.296
Tax ID belongs
to Petrosian Construction.

13:22.298 --> 13:23.798
Company owned by...

13:23.800 --> 13:26.283
Adnan Petrosian.

13:26.285 --> 13:28.252
And if we dive into that swamp
of indiscretion

13:28.254 --> 13:29.937
known as social media,

13:29.939 --> 13:31.889
we will learn that...

13:31.891 --> 13:35.359
Adnan Petrosian
has been married to Nicola

13:35.361 --> 13:37.111
for more than 20 years.

13:37.113 --> 13:38.779
They have one son Bradley,

13:38.781 --> 13:42.116
who's taking a master's
in finance at NYU.

13:42.118 --> 13:43.100
Dadda?

13:43.102 --> 13:46.437
Or dadda?

13:46.439 --> 13:48.456
Be serious, Mr. Reese.

13:48.458 --> 13:51.959
I need you to get close
to this family.

13:51.961 --> 13:55.112
[Squeals]

13:55.114 --> 13:58.299
[Camera shutter snaps]

14:00.752 --> 14:02.920
Hey, Finch.

14:02.922 --> 14:06.173
Got eyes on the Petrosians,
getting ears.

14:06.175 --> 14:08.625
These guys have serious money,
Finch.

14:08.627 --> 14:10.594
You probably go
to the same country club.

14:10.596 --> 14:12.480
Be that as it may,
do they seem like

14:12.482 --> 14:13.981
a family that's lost a baby?

14:13.983 --> 14:15.733
Behavior has damaged
this family's good name,

14:15.735 --> 14:17.818
and I've already spent a fortune
getting you out of trouble.

14:17.820 --> 14:19.236
[Camera shutter snaps]

14:19.238 --> 14:20.604
Oh, I'm so sorry
I embarrassed you, dad.

14:20.606 --> 14:23.157
Bradley, I want to know,
is this it,

14:23.159 --> 14:27.244
or are there more
unpleasant surprises?

14:27.246 --> 14:29.280
It's been taken care of, okay?

14:29.282 --> 14:32.950
Looks like mommy and daddy
are covering up for the son.

14:32.952 --> 14:34.952
How about a delicious bottle?

14:34.954 --> 14:36.670
- Finch, are you listening?
- Mmm.

14:36.672 --> 14:38.589
Oh, there you go.

14:38.591 --> 14:40.791
[Phone rings]

14:40.793 --> 14:42.009
Detective Carter's phone.

14:42.011 --> 14:44.328
Can I have Detective Carter, SVU?

14:44.330 --> 14:46.830
Carter works Homicide,
sweetheart, not SVU.

14:46.832 --> 14:50.134
This is Carter.
How can I help you?

14:50.136 --> 14:51.552
It's Mary Abbot.

14:51.554 --> 14:53.304
The man on the phone
said you worked Homicide.

14:53.306 --> 14:55.856
Oh, don't worry about him.
He's new here.

14:55.858 --> 14:58.008
- How could I help you, Mary?
- Leila did have something

14:58.010 --> 15:00.561
on her when she arrived--
A bracelet.

15:00.563 --> 15:01.862
Do you still have it?

15:01.864 --> 15:05.199
I gave it to the director,
Dr. Adalian.

15:05.201 --> 15:07.068
I asked him, but he said
he didn't remember.

15:07.070 --> 15:08.652
What did it look like?

15:08.654 --> 15:10.454
It was silver

15:10.456 --> 15:13.190
with two initials
carved on it. CC.

15:13.192 --> 15:14.375
Okay, thank you, Mary.

15:14.377 --> 15:18.913
I'll talk to you soon.

15:18.915 --> 15:20.714
All right, Detective.

15:20.716 --> 15:22.833
I've found one CC.
Working in the Petrosian home,

15:22.835 --> 15:25.336
Carrie Crosswell.

15:25.338 --> 15:28.923
But she's 58--
A little old for a fling.

15:28.925 --> 15:32.376
Now I'm checking employee files
at Petrosian Construction.

15:32.378 --> 15:35.546
- You hacked into his company?
- "Hacked" is such an ugly word.

15:35.548 --> 15:37.214
And we have two more CCs.

15:37.216 --> 15:40.651
Chad Colombo, 40, a welder,
unlikely to bear a child.

15:40.653 --> 15:43.020
And Claudia Cruz, 20,

15:43.022 --> 15:47.274
receptionist
in the head office.

15:47.276 --> 15:49.994
Claudia Cruz.
Checking.

15:49.996 --> 15:52.396
Employment with Petrosian
ended eight months ago,

15:52.398 --> 15:54.115
just when her pregnancy
would have started to show.

15:54.117 --> 15:57.251
Get me an address.
I'll go and talk to her.

15:57.253 --> 16:00.788
No, you won't.
She's dead.

16:00.790 --> 16:02.739
Name showed up
on a crime scene report.

16:02.741 --> 16:06.310
Died in her apartment
from a fire four days ago.

16:06.312 --> 16:09.413
ME ruled it as an accident.

16:21.072 --> 16:22.673
Aw, cute.
Can we say hi?

16:22.675 --> 16:24.125
Oh, she's so adorable.

16:24.127 --> 16:26.444
- Aw!
- Hi, honey.

16:26.446 --> 16:29.046
- Look at that smile.
- Thanks. Bye.

16:29.048 --> 16:31.915
You brought her with you?

16:31.917 --> 16:34.602
Every cop in the city
is looking for that kid.

16:34.604 --> 16:38.255
I'm teaching her
to go undercover.

16:38.257 --> 16:39.357
She's a natural.

16:39.359 --> 16:43.144
She's a little angel.

16:43.146 --> 16:46.147
Something happens to her, John,
so help me, God--

16:46.149 --> 16:47.898
We're trying to stop anything
from happening.

16:47.900 --> 16:50.451
We know she was in a clinic
funded by the Petrosians,

16:50.453 --> 16:53.371
and we know her mother
worked for the Petrosians.

16:53.373 --> 16:56.958
So it's probable that the father
is one of the Petrosians.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.492
But why does mom end up dead?

16:58.494 --> 17:01.746
Maybe she agreed
to give her up for adoption,

17:01.748 --> 17:04.048
then changed her mind,
said she wanted to keep it.

17:04.050 --> 17:06.334
Well, that would expose
the whole thing.

17:06.336 --> 17:08.085
DNA would prove
who the father was.

17:08.087 --> 17:10.287
He'd have to provide
for the baby.

17:10.289 --> 17:12.923
- The family would lose out.
- It's motive.

17:12.925 --> 17:14.175
Bump off the mom,

17:14.176 --> 17:17.928
make the baby disappear,
problem solved.

17:17.930 --> 17:19.680
We need to find out
if Claudia's death

17:19.682 --> 17:21.682
really was an accident.

17:21.684 --> 17:24.167
I already pulled the autopsy
and crime scene reports.

17:24.170 --> 17:26.237
I want to look through them
with a mentor of mine.

17:26.239 --> 17:28.439
- Works for the Fire Department.
- Good.

17:28.441 --> 17:30.808
I'll see if Claudia's parents
know anything.

17:30.810 --> 17:32.943
John will follow
Bradley Petrosian.

17:32.945 --> 17:36.197
After I've fed Leila.

17:36.199 --> 17:41.202
[Sighs]
Bye-bye.

17:43.154 --> 17:45.373
Mrs. Cruz.
Lucas Bennet.

17:45.375 --> 17:47.491
Department of Family Services.

17:47.493 --> 17:49.210
He says he's here
about Claudia.

17:49.212 --> 17:51.712
I'm very sorry for your loss.

17:51.714 --> 17:52.763
Why are you here?

17:52.765 --> 17:57.952
We had a report, um...

17:57.954 --> 18:03.858
From a neighbor of Claudia's--
An anonymous report--

18:03.860 --> 18:04.942
That she was pregnant.

18:04.944 --> 18:08.979
She was not.
Tell me who said that.

18:08.981 --> 18:11.615
Please, Mr. Cruz,
the source is anonymous.

18:11.617 --> 18:15.286
We have to investigate.

18:15.288 --> 18:17.738
[Sighs] Okay.

18:17.740 --> 18:21.242
[Sighs]
Claudia wasn't pregnant.

18:21.244 --> 18:24.245
I'm her mother.
We talked about everything.

18:24.247 --> 18:26.080
When did Claudia move
into her apartment?

18:26.082 --> 18:28.549
About nine months ago.
Why?

18:28.551 --> 18:29.834
About the same time
that she stopped working

18:29.836 --> 18:33.087
at Petrosian Construction?

18:33.089 --> 18:34.922
Did you see her
during that period?

18:34.924 --> 18:38.876
Not for a few months, no.

18:38.878 --> 18:42.513
She was kind of funny
about us coming around.

18:42.515 --> 18:44.265
Did Claudia have
a silver bracelet?

18:44.267 --> 18:47.852
Yes, with her initials on it.

18:47.854 --> 18:50.271
My mother gave it to her
when she was a baby.

18:50.273 --> 18:53.891
Please, just tell us.

18:53.893 --> 18:56.277
Was she pregnant?
Did she have a baby?

18:56.279 --> 18:57.661
We believe it's possible.

18:57.663 --> 18:59.897
Then where is it?
Can we see it?

18:59.899 --> 19:02.032
I can try to arrange a meeting
on neutral ground,

19:02.034 --> 19:03.584
but it would have to be
kept confidential.

19:03.586 --> 19:04.919
Oh, of course.

19:04.921 --> 19:07.070
What else can you tell me
about Claudia?

19:07.072 --> 19:12.743
Was she in a relationship,
for example?

19:12.745 --> 19:18.265
She left some papers here
about a month before she died.

19:18.267 --> 19:21.185
We found this.

19:21.187 --> 19:25.806
I think he's
Mr. Petrosian's son Bradley.

19:28.593 --> 19:32.079
Any luck, Mr. Reese?

19:32.081 --> 19:34.315
Bradley Petrosian
has been a good student.

19:34.317 --> 19:35.866
Hasn't phoned anyone,

19:35.868 --> 19:38.536
hasn't spoken
to any suspicious characters.

19:38.538 --> 19:40.738
So are we barking
up the wrong tree?

19:40.740 --> 19:43.290
Maybe.

19:43.292 --> 19:46.110
Hang on.

19:46.112 --> 19:51.966
He's meeting someone.

19:51.968 --> 19:54.301
Finch...

19:54.303 --> 19:56.053
You were right
about the wrong tree.

19:56.055 --> 19:57.505
What?

19:57.507 --> 19:59.122
I don't think
Bradley Petrosian

19:59.124 --> 20:01.842
was sleeping with Claudia Cruz.

20:01.844 --> 20:03.194
Sorry?

20:03.196 --> 20:06.630
His tastes run
in the other direction.

20:06.632 --> 20:08.983
So we should look
at the father, Adnan.

20:08.985 --> 20:11.602
I'll get eyes on him.

20:11.604 --> 20:12.903
How's their baby doing?

20:12.905 --> 20:16.907
Oh, she's--

20:16.909 --> 20:18.659
Reese, you better
get back here.

20:18.661 --> 20:21.912
Makes sense.
Lots of candles.

20:21.914 --> 20:23.330
One catches the drapes.

20:23.332 --> 20:24.915
Do we know why
Claudia didn't run?

20:24.917 --> 20:27.334
Blood screen showed
traces of alcohol.

20:27.336 --> 20:30.504
So she was drinking.
She fell asleep.

20:30.506 --> 20:31.922
Faulty smoke alarm.

20:31.924 --> 20:34.992
Fire Marshal said
the battery was dead.

20:34.994 --> 20:37.294
Battery isn't the problem.
Wiring is.

20:37.296 --> 20:39.463
The hot wire
is just plastic coating.

20:39.465 --> 20:41.098
The wire itself was removed.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.333
No connection, no alarm.

20:43.335 --> 20:45.886
Dead battery could be
an accident, but this--

20:45.888 --> 20:47.188
You got the autopsy photos?

20:47.190 --> 20:50.024
Yeah.

20:50.026 --> 20:52.860
ME said heat caused
the cracks, not trauma.

20:52.862 --> 20:57.031
High temperatures
can cause the skull to fissure.

20:57.033 --> 21:02.853
Cracks all along the plate lines
of the skull.

21:02.855 --> 21:06.023
There is no natural
plate line there, but--

21:06.025 --> 21:10.211
- It was caused by a blow.
- Yeah.

21:10.213 --> 21:14.215
She was unconscious
when the fire was set.

21:14.217 --> 21:15.583
But a blow with what?

21:15.585 --> 21:17.017
Bone was cracked.

21:17.019 --> 21:19.169
Wasn't pierced or shattered.

21:19.171 --> 21:24.058
Something round.

21:27.712 --> 21:30.397
Like this?

21:30.399 --> 21:31.982
Could be.

21:31.984 --> 21:34.768
You wash the soot off that,
you might get lucky.

21:34.770 --> 21:37.054
Heat can etch fingerprints
into the metal.

21:37.056 --> 21:41.408
Could give you your killer.

21:44.228 --> 21:46.530
- But how could you let her go?
- I didn't.

21:46.532 --> 21:48.749
She just knocked down
the books and walked off.

21:48.751 --> 21:50.501
She can't walk, Finch.

21:50.503 --> 21:53.337
Oh, God.

21:53.339 --> 21:54.838
I'll never forgive myself.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.957
[Coos]

21:56.959 --> 22:01.629
[Giggles]

22:01.631 --> 22:03.413
Give it to me now, Leila.

22:03.415 --> 22:06.750
- Please just give it to me.
- You got her?

22:06.752 --> 22:08.385
Oh, my God, that's a grenade.

22:08.387 --> 22:11.388
Please just--

22:11.390 --> 22:13.357
Just a tear gas grenade.

22:13.359 --> 22:15.893
It's still a grenade.

22:15.895 --> 22:17.978
You're okay.
You're okay, sweetie.

22:17.980 --> 22:20.114
Come on.
It's okay.

22:20.116 --> 22:22.900
I told you to move
your arsenal.

22:22.902 --> 22:24.618
- I was going to.
- When?

22:24.620 --> 22:27.621
After the whole place
is blown up?

22:27.623 --> 22:29.272
You know how I feel about guns.

22:29.274 --> 22:30.741
This really isn't working,

22:30.743 --> 22:32.960
one of us always being here,
minding the baby.

22:32.962 --> 22:35.079
Well, you're the one
who stole her.

22:35.081 --> 22:36.580
Thanks for reminding me
of that.

22:36.582 --> 22:39.800
I'm gonna take her
to her grandparents.

22:39.802 --> 22:43.620
They can keep an eye on her
until we neutralize the threat.

22:43.622 --> 22:46.006
Finch, the bad guys
got to Claudia.

22:46.008 --> 22:47.591
- Here we go.
- They could be

22:47.593 --> 22:49.343
after Sammy and Veda too.

22:49.345 --> 22:51.178

Come on, baby.

37:56.974 --> 37:59.274
Come on.

38:23.850 --> 38:26.968
[Bangs head]

38:34.327 --> 38:39.481
Elias.
Elias.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.900
Yes, John?

38:41.902 --> 38:45.353
All right.

38:45.355 --> 38:46.805
You win.

38:46.807 --> 38:48.607
We both win, John.

38:48.609 --> 38:52.327
Where's Moretti?

38:52.329 --> 38:54.646
What guarantee do I have?

38:54.648 --> 38:59.868
You don't.

38:59.870 --> 39:05.674
1465 Jefferson...

39:05.676 --> 39:08.844
Queens.

39:08.846 --> 39:11.346
Thank you, John.

39:11.348 --> 39:15.133
You were right.
I would never harm a child.

39:15.135 --> 39:17.803
But then I knew
you wouldn't either.

39:17.805 --> 39:19.638
Good-bye, John.

39:19.640 --> 39:22.441
Elias!
Elias!

39:40.326 --> 39:42.026
Come on.
Come on, baby.

39:42.028 --> 39:44.362
Come on, baby.

39:44.364 --> 39:47.966
Cry.
Cry.

40:03.215 --> 40:05.517
Leila's in the truck.
I got to take your car.

40:05.519 --> 40:07.769
- What on earth happened?
- Elias happened.

40:12.742 --> 40:14.893
[Cries]

40:14.895 --> 40:16.361
[Cell phone rings]
Carter.

40:16.363 --> 40:19.331
Elias knows where Moretti is.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.700
How does he know?

40:21.702 --> 40:24.336
I'm on my way.
Just get over there.

40:24.338 --> 40:27.372
[Cell phone dialing]

40:27.374 --> 40:29.457
Szymanski, Carter,
we've been blown.

40:29.459 --> 40:31.894
Get Moretti out of there now.

40:32.898 --> 40:35.312
Gianni!
It's Szymanski.

40:36.266 --> 40:37.686
Gianni.

40:39.085 --> 40:40.552
Just in time for a drink.

40:40.554 --> 40:42.938
Afraid not.
Carter says we got to move.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.857
Quick.
Get your stuff.

40:54.750 --> 40:57.285
Are you there,
Mr. Reese?

40:58.871 --> 41:01.323
I'm here.
So is Carter.

41:01.325 --> 41:04.543
Oh, no.

41:04.545 --> 41:07.412
I need a bus.
1465 Jefferson, Queens.

41:07.414 --> 41:09.047
Officer down with a gunshot
to the abdomen.

41:09.049 --> 41:10.882
I repeat, officer down.

41:10.884 --> 41:13.618
[Police radio chatter]

41:13.620 --> 41:14.719
Moretti.

41:14.721 --> 41:16.805
They got him.

41:16.807 --> 41:18.623
How did Elias know?

41:18.625 --> 41:21.343
I told him.

41:21.345 --> 41:23.762
I had to give up the safe house
to save the baby.

41:23.764 --> 41:26.798
John, why were you
even talking to Elias?

41:26.800 --> 41:29.100
I had no choice.

41:29.102 --> 41:31.353
We lost the kid.

41:32.905 --> 41:37.075
You say there was no choice,
but there was, John.

41:37.077 --> 41:38.777
It's called the police.

41:38.779 --> 41:40.745
It's what we do.

41:40.747 --> 41:44.282
I can't do this anymore.

41:44.284 --> 41:45.817
I can't.

41:45.819 --> 41:50.321
You and your friend.

41:50.323 --> 41:52.591
I'm sorry.

41:52.593 --> 41:53.875
[Ambulance siren wails]

41:53.877 --> 41:55.043
Go on.

41:55.045 --> 41:57.295
This place will be swarming.

41:58.598 --> 42:01.016
Go.

42:01.018 --> 42:04.219
Go!

42:33.416 --> 42:35.800
Bye, Leila.

42:47.713 --> 42:49.380
You be a good girl.

42:49.382 --> 42:53.718
Thank you so much.

42:53.720 --> 42:56.655
Be nice to have a child.

42:56.657 --> 42:58.073
[Door shuts]

42:58.075 --> 42:59.824
Children.

42:59.826 --> 43:03.912
Think that'll ever happen?

43:06.115 --> 43:08.917
Probably not.

43:08.919 --> 43:11.586
Our line of work.

43:11.588 --> 43:13.404
The trouble with children--

43:13.406 --> 43:17.509
You never know
how they're gonna turn out.

43:30.255 --> 43:32.857
Hello, dad.
