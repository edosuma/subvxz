switched on the lidar.

Don't try to get
in my head.

34:40.165 --> 34:41.601
DESI: Clearly, there's not
a lot in there

34:41.644 --> 34:42.689
if you're making choices
like this.

34:42.732 --> 34:44.604
Just keep talking, Desi.

34:50.523 --> 34:53.743
DESI: Walk away now, and
we'll forget this is treason.SPENCER: Enough!

34:53.787 --> 34:56.137
Tell your buddy to come out now
or I'm gonna shoot this man!

34:56.181 --> 34:57.269
And then I'm gonna shoot you.

34:57.312 --> 34:58.531
DESI:
This man has a name.

34:58.574 --> 34:59.967
It's Lieutenant Commander
Robert Reese,

35:00.010 --> 35:02.100
and he's served more than
15 years in the Navy.

35:02.143 --> 35:03.927
He's a husband to Rose,
a father to twins.

35:03.971 --> 35:05.625
He makes the best shrimp gumbo
you've ever had

35:05.668 --> 35:07.017
outside New Orleans,
and he never hesitates

35:07.061 --> 35:09.107
to let a friend
crash on his couch.

35:13.067 --> 35:16.070
You really think you can play
a tune on my heartstrings?

35:16.114 --> 35:17.463
I think you once loved
your country

35:17.506 --> 35:18.942
the same way this man does.

35:18.986 --> 35:20.074
You and your
guys stumbled

35:20.118 --> 35:21.902
upon a cache
of chem weapons.

35:21.945 --> 35:23.164
Millions of dollars just
sitting in the ground.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.426
Anyone would be tempted.

35:28.430 --> 35:29.866
But this can still
get sorted out.

35:29.910 --> 35:33.131
We crossed a line that
there's no coming back from.

35:34.219 --> 35:36.351
It's not too late.

35:36.395 --> 35:38.658
For you, it is.

35:44.925 --> 35:46.318
What the hell?

35:47.797 --> 35:50.060
Oh, those are my buddies
from Delta Force C Squadron

35:50.104 --> 35:51.149
saying hi.

35:51.192 --> 35:53.412
Wave back, boys.

35:53.455 --> 35:54.674
You're surrounded.

35:55.718 --> 35:58.199
Hold for my command!

36:00.897 --> 36:03.204
So here we are, Spencer.

36:03.248 --> 36:04.640
Decision time.

36:04.684 --> 36:06.207
We can do this

36:06.251 --> 36:08.644
the easy way or the messy way.

36:08.688 --> 36:10.777
Your choice.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.053
On your knees.

36:28.055 --> 36:30.231

behind your head.

36:37.891 --> 36:39.240

36:48.162 --> 36:50.512
How did you know
I was gonna use the lidar

36:50.556 --> 36:52.427
to fake a team of snipers?

36:52.471 --> 36:55.952
I didn't. But I'm starting to
realize that, given enough time,

36:55.996 --> 36:58.955
you'll always come up
with something.

36:58.999 --> 37:00.566
I didn't think you
were paying attention

37:00.609 --> 37:02.916
when I was talking
about Reese earlier.

37:02.959 --> 37:04.657
I'm always
paying attention.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.180
I'm starting
to realize that.

♪

37:17.322 --> 37:18.366
[Rose sniffles]

37:18.410 --> 37:20.890
I'm so glad you're home.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.938
Come on, now.
I wasn't gone that long.

37:24.981 --> 37:26.374
[laughs]

37:28.071 --> 37:31.074
We can never
thank you enough.

37:31.118 --> 37:35.296
But, uh, we can start with
dinner at the house on Sunday.

37:35.340 --> 37:36.645
I'd never miss it.

37:36.689 --> 37:40.301
I expect you both.
It's gumbo night.

37:43.652 --> 37:46.307
Thank you.Of course.

37:46.351 --> 37:49.223
CASSIE and KYLE:
Thank you, Uncle MacGyver.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.356
I'll see you guys
on Sunday, okay?

37:51.399 --> 37:53.314
CASSIE and KYLE:
See you Sunday.

37:53.358 --> 37:55.534
Thanks again, pal.

37:55.577 --> 37:57.187
You got it.

38:04.325 --> 38:06.458
MATTY: You'll be happy
to know that Spencer

38:06.501 --> 38:08.721
and the other rogue CIA agents

38:08.764 --> 38:10.897
are in federal custody
and cooperating.

38:10.940 --> 38:13.203
And with the intel
they'll give us on their buyer,

38:13.247 --> 38:15.336
we should be able to take
a half a dozen terrorist groups

38:15.380 --> 38:16.555
off the board.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.470
That's very good news.

38:18.513 --> 38:19.949
They also gave up the saboteur

38:19.993 --> 38:22.517
who uploaded the virus
to the lidar camera.

38:22.561 --> 38:25.172
They bribed a contractor
in Turkey who had access

38:25.215 --> 38:27.348
to the U.S. airfield
where Reese was stationed.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.394
But most importantly,

38:29.437 --> 38:31.744
Reese is back home safe
with his family.

38:31.787 --> 38:35.269
Yeah. I thought I was
gonna have to hand over

38:35.313 --> 38:37.184
a folded American
flag to Rose, so...

38:37.227 --> 38:38.533
Thanks to you both,

38:38.577 --> 38:40.013
that didn't happen.

38:40.056 --> 38:41.231
Nice work.

38:41.275 --> 38:42.972
Thanks.

38:43.016 --> 38:44.017
Thank you.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.987
Still having robot
problems, huh?

39:00.425 --> 39:02.383
I'm glad this amuses you.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.385
Do you have any idea
how many hours I spent

39:04.429 --> 39:05.821
bringing this guy to life?You have friends.

39:05.865 --> 39:08.607
Why did you feel the need
to build another one?

39:08.650 --> 39:10.826
I like to make things.

39:10.870 --> 39:12.480
Apparently,
you like to destroy them.

39:12.524 --> 39:15.265
Look, it is cruel and inhumane

39:15.309 --> 39:18.225
to leave a sentient being not
knowing the answer to a riddle.

39:18.268 --> 39:20.227
Especially
a sensitive and caring

39:20.270 --> 39:21.402
sentient being like yourself?

39:21.446 --> 39:22.577
Just tell me the answer, please.

39:22.621 --> 39:24.318
[sighs]
It's a play on words, Bozer.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.408
"What is the fifth
cousin's name."

39:27.452 --> 39:29.279
That's a statement,
not a question.

39:30.716 --> 39:33.066
What in the hell
are you talking about?

39:33.109 --> 39:34.720
The answer is "What," Bozer.

39:34.763 --> 39:37.287
That's not a riddle.Except it is.

39:37.331 --> 39:40.247
What is the fifth cousin's name.
Of course.

39:40.290 --> 39:42.118
Sparky. You're okay?

39:42.162 --> 39:43.424
I believe so.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.470
My failure to solve
Agent Nguyen's riddle

39:45.513 --> 39:48.342
was due to my inability
to identify her final sentence

39:48.386 --> 39:49.474
as a statement.

ROBOT: Actually, Bozer,
riddles like these

40:00.528 --> 40:01.703
could be
a great help to me.

40:01.747 --> 40:03.009
They will improve
my ability

40:03.052 --> 40:04.750

expression and tone.

in this for you.

Let's see if it closes first

40:36.695 --> 40:39.132
before we call it
a new career path.

Perfect.
Boom.

hold our breath waiting for

the LAPD to fix your door.Yeah, you got that right.

40:58.107 --> 41:00.327

of how helpless I feel trying

to protect you from this part
of your life that, you know,

41:03.069 --> 41:05.941
you can't tell me about.

41:10.424 --> 41:12.557

the old man can do, so...

Well, you should know,

41:14.297 --> 41:15.777
for the swatting is in custody.

He's gonna be spending
a long time behind bars.

that has excellent spring rolls.

I don't know.

41:52.161 --> 41:53.511
What's going on?

41:53.554 --> 41:55.730
Had some words with
your Estonian hacker friend.

41:55.774 --> 41:58.472
He said he got your address
on a dark web forum

41:58.516 --> 42:02.258
used by organized crime and
even some terrorist networks.

42:02.302 --> 42:03.738
Said it was posted
less than a week ago.

42:03.782 --> 42:06.349
By who? And how'd
they get my address?

you called me in here

just to say you hit a dead end.

42:14.923 --> 42:16.316
What is it?

42:17.360 --> 42:18.666

42:18.710 --> 42:21.234
wasn't the only address
posted on this forum.
