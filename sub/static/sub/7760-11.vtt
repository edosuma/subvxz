[fog horn
in the distance]

00:44.578 --> 00:46.280
- WHERE THE FUCK ARE WE?

00:46.314 --> 00:49.150
- MY GUESS, ALTOONA.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.152
- WHERE'D YOU HEAR
ABOUT THIS PLACE AGAIN?

00:51.185 --> 00:53.354
- I READ ABOUT IT IN O.
- [scoffing]

00:53.387 --> 00:55.156
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL
DOUCHE ADS.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.557
- WELL, I'LL HAVE TO GET YOU
A SUBSCRIPTION

00:56.590 --> 00:59.427
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.462
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
THIS IS IT.

01:01.495 --> 01:04.498
- AHA.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.467
[sighs]

01:12.873 --> 01:15.309
WE'RE HERE
FOR THE FELDMAN BAR MITZVAH.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.644
[chuckles]

01:16.677 --> 01:19.613
- EH, COME ON.

01:22.516 --> 01:23.717
[door slams]

01:23.751 --> 01:25.253
- UGH.
- DON'T DO THAT.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.887
DON'T DO THAT.
WATCH IT, WATCH IT.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.257
- NO, NO, NO.
- OH, YEAH.

01:29.290 --> 01:32.593
[moans
and indistinct chatter]

01:32.626 --> 01:35.229
- COME ON.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.275
- YOUR COCK IS REALLY HARD.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.777
- YEAH, TRY FROZEN SOLID.
- HMM.

01:49.810 --> 01:52.780
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE MY TONGUE'LL
STICK TO IT, DO YOU?

01:55.383 --> 01:58.686
[men moaning]

01:58.719 --> 02:00.654
- YEAH.
- YOUR HANDS ARE COLD.

02:00.688 --> 02:03.557
- I'M COMING.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.293
- [gasps]

02:05.326 --> 02:07.828
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- THE METAL'S FUCKING FREEZING.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.530
- THIS SUCKS.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.899
- AND NOT IN A POSITIVE,
LIFE-AFFIRMING WAY.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.402
- THERE HAS TO BE SOMEPLACE ELSE
WE CAN GO.

02:14.435 --> 02:17.638
- [sighs]

02:17.671 --> 02:20.341
[grunting]

02:33.887 --> 02:35.823
- [moans]

02:38.859 --> 02:41.829

- [gasps]

02:47.301 --> 02:49.803
[both panting]

02:49.837 --> 02:53.541
- AH, THAT WAS GREAT.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.810
- A-MAZING.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.679
- AND CLIMATE-CONTROLLED.

02:58.712 --> 03:02.616
- [chuckles]

03:02.650 --> 03:07.488
STOCKWELL'S FINALLY DONE IT.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.858
FORCED US TO STAY AT HOME
AND FUCK IN OUR BEDS.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.626
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO HELPED HIM

03:12.660 --> 03:15.596
TURN US INTO STRAIGHT,
LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS.

03:20.268 --> 03:23.203
- CALL ME DR. SPIN.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.642
- YOU COULD BE DR. EVIL.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.488
[door opens and shuts]

03:46.560 --> 03:49.630
- SO WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWO
DOING HERE THIS EARLY?

03:49.663 --> 03:50.931
- BEN HAD US UP ALL NIGHT,

03:50.964 --> 03:52.866
PROWLING EVERY BACK STREET
IN THE CITY.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.735
- WHEN DID YOU BECOME A COUPLE
OF ALLEY CATS?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.937
- WE DIDN'T.
- WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THIS KID.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.340
- THE ONE WE BROUGHT IN HERE
LAST WEEK.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.542
- OH, I REMEMBER.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.477
- I GOTTA TELL HIM SOME NEWS.

04:03.511 --> 04:06.013
- HE'S POSITIVE.

04:06.046 --> 04:09.683
- CHRIST, HE'S JUST A KID.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.419
SO WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO TELL HIM?

04:11.452 --> 04:13.053
- IT'S A LONG STORY.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.490
- HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL,
AND, UH...

04:16.524 --> 04:18.659
GAVE THEM MY NAME,
SAID I WAS HIS UNCLE.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.793
- AND BEN WENT ALONG WITH IT.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.429
- HE DIDN'T WANT
TO GET PUT BACK

04:21.462 --> 04:23.497
IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.433
- SO NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE?

04:25.466 --> 04:27.568
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GET
INTO SOME SERIOUS TROUBLE,

04:27.601 --> 04:28.802
MESSING AROUND
IN THIS KID'S LIFE.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.804
- TELL HIM.
- I JUST DID.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.574
- THEN AGAIN,
MAYBE WE CAN HELP HIM.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.943
THAT IS, IF WE CAN FIND HIM.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.379
- WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME?
I CAN TELL YOU WHERE TO LOOK.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.647
- YOU CAN?

04:39.680 --> 04:40.981
- SWEETHEART,
CHECK OUT THE CLIENTELE.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.416
WHO IN THE FUCK DO YOU THINK
COMES IN HERE

04:42.450 --> 04:43.717
THIS HOUR OF THE MORNING?

04:43.751 --> 04:45.786
BOYS WHO ARE WORKING
THE NIGHT SHIFT.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.054
LAST I HEARD,
THEY'D ALL MOVED

04:47.087 --> 04:49.590
OVER TO THE WAREHOUSE DISTRICT.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.593
- MOTHER KNOWS BEST.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.596
- SO WHO WANTS ANOTHER WAFFLE?
TED?

04:55.629 --> 04:58.065
- HUH? YEAH, SURE.
WHY NOT?

04:58.098 --> 05:01.068
- ME TOO.
THEY'RE YUMMY.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.470
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

05:02.503 --> 05:04.538
- A WAFFLE IRON...

05:04.572 --> 05:06.407
AND WAFFLE MIX?

05:06.440 --> 05:09.677
- I'LL HAVE
TO REMEMBER THAT.

05:09.710 --> 05:14.582
HOW NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE PLAN
A MEAL FOR ME FOR A CHANGE.

05:14.615 --> 05:15.949
- SO THINGS ARE GOING WELL?

05:15.983 --> 05:18.952
- MM, AT LEAST TWO EVENTS
A WEEK.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.954
I FINALLY GAVE MY NOTICE
AT TORSO.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.956
AUF WIEDERSEHEN, AU REVOIR,
AND GOOD RIDDANCE

05:22.990 --> 05:27.428
TO PEDDLING POLYESTER PULLOVERS
TO TWEAKED-OUT CLUB KIDS.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.463
[children shouting
in the distance]

05:33.066 --> 05:35.969
- TEDDY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

05:36.003 --> 05:37.738
- OH, THE USUAL.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.106
RE-READING SCHOPENHAUER,

05:39.139 --> 05:41.509
WORKING ON MY THEORY
OF POST-NEO-RELATIVITY,

05:41.542 --> 05:42.776
AND I THINK I DISCOVERED
A NEW BLACK HOLE

05:42.810 --> 05:44.478
BETWEEN PLUTO AND JUPITER.

05:44.512 --> 05:45.846
PASS THE SYRUP.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.948
- [chuckles]

05:49.950 --> 05:51.719
WELL, YOU KNOW,
MEL AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING...

05:51.752 --> 05:53.921
- THAT IF YOU COULD SPARE
THE TIME...

05:53.954 --> 05:55.523
- YOU MIGHT HELP US.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.924
YOU SEE, WE'VE MANAGED,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

05:56.957 --> 05:59.026
TO ACTUALLY SET ASIDE
A LITTLE BIT OF CASH.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.629
- WE WANT TO START
A COLLEGE FUND FOR GUS.

06:01.662 --> 06:05.065
- WHAT A WONDERFUL IDEA!

06:05.098 --> 06:07.134
- BUT IT'LL NEED
TO BE MANAGED PROPERLY BY...

06:07.167 --> 06:08.502
SOMEONE WE CAN TRUST.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.871
- SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.606
- LIKE ME?
- MM-HMM.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.874
- WELL, CONSIDERING
HOW MANY TIMES

06:13.907 --> 06:15.876
YOU'VE SAVED MY ASS
ON TAXES,

06:15.909 --> 06:17.878
NOT TO MENTION THAT AMAZING
PROGRAM YOU PUT US ON,

06:17.911 --> 06:19.413
SO LINZ COULD STAY HOME
WITH THE BABY...

06:19.447 --> 06:22.916
- YOU'D BE
THE PERFECT PERSON.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.151
- WE WANT TO START
WITH $5,000.

06:24.184 --> 06:27.888
- AND THEN ADD TO IT
WHEN WE CAN.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.189
- SO WHAT DO YOU SAY,

06:29.222 --> 06:34.027
TED SCHMIDT,
FINANCIAL WIZARD?

06:34.061 --> 06:37.765
- UH, YEAH, SURE.
I MEAN, WE COULD...

06:37.798 --> 06:40.167
LADDER IT IN STABLE BONDS.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.035
I'D STAY AWAY
FROM THE MARKET FOR NOW,

06:42.069 --> 06:44.672
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S
STABILITY AT SOME POINT,

06:44.705 --> 06:47.775
I WOULDN'T BE ADVERSE
TO INVESTING IN SOME BLUE CHIPS.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.643
- LISTEN TO HIM.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.178
- TEDDY KNOWS.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.514
- HE SURE DOES.
- WHOO-HOO.

06:53.547 --> 06:56.650
[chuckles]

06:56.684 --> 06:58.819
- AND SINCE IT'S THE LAST SPOT
BEFORE THE ELECTION,

06:58.852 --> 07:02.690
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING
BROAD-SWEEPING, AN EPIC.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.526
- LORD OF THE RINGS
IN 30 SECONDS?

07:05.559 --> 07:06.860
- SOMETHING THAT WILL PUT YOU
IN THE CONTEXT

07:06.894 --> 07:08.996
OF THE ENTIRE CITY--

07:09.029 --> 07:10.698
A MAN FOR ALL THE PEOPLE.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.666
- I GET IT,
SHOW ME WITH AS MANY RACIALLY

07:12.700 --> 07:14.868
AND CULTURALLY DIVERSE GROUPS
AS POSSIBLE.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.670
- EXACTLY.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.806
- ACTUALLY,
IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

07:18.839 --> 07:22.476
- I DON'T REALLY HAVE
BAD IDEAS.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.977
AND I WANT THE CAMERAS ON YOU
AT ALL TIMES.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.946
WE'LL GET YOU
AT THE ASIAN CULTURAL SOCIETY,

07:25.979 --> 07:28.215
THE HISPANIC INSTITUTE,
THE GAY AND LESBIAN CENTER--

07:28.248 --> 07:29.950
- THE GAY AND LESBIAN CENTER?

07:29.983 --> 07:31.952
- I'M NOT TOO POPULAR
IN THAT NECK OF THE WOODS.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.688
- PERHAPS WE SHOULD SCRATCH
THAT ONE.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.990
- LET'S NOT BE TOO HASTY.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.259
THEY DID ENDORSE YOU, AFTER ALL,
AND WHO KNOWS?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.161
WHEN IT COMES DOWN
TO ELECTION DAY,

07:41.194 --> 07:43.597
IT MAY BE
THOSE FEW EXTRA VOTES

07:43.631 --> 07:45.098
THAT TIP THINGS
IN YOUR FAVOR.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.867
- WOULDN'T THAT BE A LAUGH,

07:46.900 --> 07:48.969
IF IT WERE THE GAYS
THAT PUT YOU IN OFFICE?

07:49.002 --> 07:52.540
- THE POLLS DO SHOW THAT
THE RACE IS GETTING TIGHTER.

07:54.207 --> 07:57.611
- GO KISS SOME HANDS.
SHAKE SOME BABIES.

07:59.747 --> 08:02.783
- WASN'T IT SWEET OF THE GIRLS
TO HAVE US OVER?

08:02.816 --> 08:05.919
AND HOW ABOUT THEM ASKING YOU
TO MANAGE GUS' COLLEGE FUND?

08:05.953 --> 08:09.256
- YEAH.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

08:09.289 --> 08:12.593
SO HOW LONG HAVE THE THREE
OF YOU BEEN PLANNING THIS?

08:12.626 --> 08:13.927
- NOT LONG.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.262
I MEAN,
THEY DID MENTION SOMETHING

08:15.295 --> 08:17.598
WHEN THEY CALLED TO INVITE US
TO BRUNCH.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.266
- AND YOU, NO DOUBT, THOUGHT IT
WAS A SPLENDID IDEA

08:19.299 --> 08:21.268
TO INVENT A LITTLE PROJECT
TO KEEP TEDDY BUSY,

08:21.301 --> 08:22.636
IS THAT IT?

08:22.670 --> 08:24.605
- NO, THAT IS NOT IT.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.607
THEY'RE YOUR FRIENDS.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.775
AND SINCE IT'S
THEIR SON'S FUTURE,

08:27.808 --> 08:30.210
THEY OBVIOUSLY TRUST YOU.

08:30.243 --> 08:33.747
- TED!

08:33.781 --> 08:34.915
HEY, MAN.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.216
- OH, HI.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.786
- THIS IS DEREK AND ROMAN.

08:38.819 --> 08:42.022
- UH, THIS IS EMMETT,
MY PARTNER.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.190
- I PREFER "LOVER."

08:43.223 --> 08:44.792
I KNOW IT'S NOT P.C.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.160
TO SAY THAT ANYMORE,
BUT I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.029
SO ARE YOU BOYS COMING BACK
FROM BABYLON?

08:49.062 --> 08:51.164
- THEY SHUT DOWN THE BACK ROOM.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

08:51.198 --> 08:54.301
SO WE'RE GOING TO MY PLACE
TO FUCK.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.169
- THAT'S...NICE.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.706
- YOU GUYS WANT TO COME?

08:58.739 --> 09:01.642
- OH, UH, NO, THANKS.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.343
SOME OTHER TIME.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.778
- [snaps fingers]

09:04.812 --> 09:09.116
- SO LONG.

09:09.149 --> 09:13.220
- WOW, HE SEEMED
REALLY TWEAKED OUT.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.955
HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM, ANYWAY?

09:14.988 --> 09:16.790
- [clears throat]
OH, HE'S A...

09:16.824 --> 09:18.659
EAR, NOSE,
AND THROAT SPECIALIST.

09:18.692 --> 09:21.695
I WENT TO HIM ONCE
TO HAVE MY SINUSES DRAINED.

09:21.729 --> 09:22.930
- UNTIL YOU JUST SAID THAT,

09:22.963 --> 09:24.131
THE SCARIEST THING
I EVER IMAGINED

09:24.164 --> 09:25.699
WAS MY PARENTS HAVING SEX.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.334
OH, OH.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.703
OH, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

09:29.737 --> 09:30.938
OKAY, I NEED THESE.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.105
THREE OF THESE?
FOUR OF THESE?

09:32.139 --> 09:33.707
I'M NOT EVEN SURE.

09:33.741 --> 09:34.808
HONEY, CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME
A SECOND?

09:34.842 --> 09:36.009
I JUST--I WANT TO RUN IN

09:36.043 --> 09:37.678
AND PICK UP
A COUPLE OF THESE HERE.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.279
- I JUST WANT TO SAY,
CHIEF STOCKWELL,

09:39.312 --> 09:41.849
THAT I TOTALLY SUPPORT YOUR
EFFORTS TO MAKE LIBERTY AVENUE

09:41.882 --> 09:44.017
A DECENT AND RESPECTABLE PLACE
TO LIVE.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.153
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- BUT I WAS WONDERING

09:46.186 --> 09:48.355
WHY IT TAKES THE POLICE SO LONG
TO RESPOND.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.724
MY TOWNHOUSE WAS BROKEN INTO
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.961
I CALLED, AND THE POLICE
DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR TWO HOURS.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.162
[crowd murmurs in agreement]

09:55.195 --> 09:56.697
- UNFORTUNATELY,
THE CURRENT MAYOR CUT

09:56.730 --> 09:58.131
MY DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET,

09:58.165 --> 10:00.868
BUT WHEN I'M ELECTED,
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU

10:00.901 --> 10:03.403
A GREATER POLICE PRESENCE
ON LIBERTY AVENUE.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.605
[scattered applause]

10:08.909 --> 10:11.845
- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS
FOR THE CHIEF?

10:11.879 --> 10:14.748
- MARGARITA LOPEZ.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.850
- EXCUSE ME?

10:16.884 --> 10:19.386
- MARGARITA LOPEZ WAS
A TRANSSEXUAL.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.854
SHE WAS MURDERED
FIVE YEARS AGO.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.056
HER KILLERS
HAVE NEVER BEEN FOUND.

10:23.090 --> 10:27.027
THE PITTSBURGH P.D. DOES
ITS BEST TO SOLVE EVERY CRIME.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.295
HOWEVER, THERE'S ALWAYS
THE OCCASIONAL--

10:28.328 --> 10:29.863
- JEFFERSON PROCTOR.

10:29.897 --> 10:32.800
- JEFFERSON PROCTOR WAS
A GAY AFRICAN-AMERICAN,

10:32.833 --> 10:34.935
SHOT TO DEATH HALF A BLOCK
FROM WOODY'S.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.169
CRIME UNSOLVED.

10:36.203 --> 10:39.039
- NATASHA GINSBURG.

10:39.072 --> 10:43.276
- NATASHA GINSBURG, AGE 61,
A LESBIAN OUT WALKING HER DOG.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.413
STABBED TO DEATH,
KILLER STILL AT LARGE.

10:46.446 --> 10:49.416
- JUSTIN TAYLOR.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.019
- JUSTIN TAYLOR,
MY BEAUTIFUL GAY SON.

10:52.052 --> 10:55.222
ATTACKED AT HIS PROM,
LEFT FOR DEAD.

10:55.255 --> 10:58.692
POLICE REPORTED IT
AS A SIMPLE ASSAULT,

10:58.726 --> 11:00.894
INSTEAD OF A HATE CRIME,
WHICH IT WAS.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.931
HIS ATTACKER GOT OFF
WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.699
- OH, I REMEMBER THAT.
- I REMEMBER THAT.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.768
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

11:07.801 --> 11:09.903
I WANT TO THANK
THESE CONCERNED CITIZENS

11:09.937 --> 11:12.806
FOR REMINDING ME OF THE VIOLENCE
THAT THREATENS

11:12.840 --> 11:14.775
AND SOMETIMES
CLAIMS THE LIVES

11:14.808 --> 11:16.910
OF MEMBERS
OF THIS COMMUNITY.

11:16.944 --> 11:21.248
HOWEVER, THE VAST MAJORITY
OF VIOLENT CRIMES ARE SOLVED

11:21.281 --> 11:23.450
AND THE CRIMINALS
APPREHENDED.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.318
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

11:25.352 --> 11:28.255
[crowd chattering]

11:28.288 --> 11:32.325
DID YOU DO YOUR BEST FOR HIM?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.995
- I REMEMBER THAT BOY.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.831
HIS MURDER WAS TRAGIC,
SOMEONE SO YOUNG.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.834
- THEN WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

11:44.872 --> 11:48.075
- I MAY NOT RECALL HIS NAME,
BUT I DO KNOW THAT--

11:48.108 --> 11:50.077
- JASON KEMP.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.145
- HIS NAME WAS JASON KEMP.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.847
AND THE REASON
YOU DON'T REMEMBER IT

11:53.881 --> 11:55.883
IS BECAUSE NO ONE
ON YOUR POLICE FORCE

11:55.916 --> 11:59.352
WAS EVER ABLE TO FIND OUT
WHAT IT WAS.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.955
BUT I DID,

12:01.989 --> 12:04.124
THE WAITRESS WHO FOUND HIS BODY
IN A DUMPSTER

12:04.157 --> 12:06.493
BEHIND THE DINER WHERE I WORK.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.961
- LET'S WRAP THIS UP.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.162
- JASON KEMP,

12:09.196 --> 12:12.132
A.K.A. DUMPSTER BOY.

[crowd chattering]

12:13.400 --> 12:16.503

12:19.306 --> 12:20.908

12:23.543 --> 12:25.245
UH, WE SHOULD REMEMBER

12:25.278 --> 12:27.380
THAT JIM STOCKWELL
IS A VERY BUSY MAN,

12:27.414 --> 12:29.850
AND WE'RE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL
TO HIM

12:29.883 --> 12:32.252
FOR FINDING THE TIME TO COME
TO SPEAK TO US...

12:32.285 --> 12:33.854
- SHAME ON YOU.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.856
- ABOUT THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.991
THANK YOU, JIM,
VERY MUCH.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.393
[loud chatter]

12:40.427 --> 12:42.162
- HE'S PROBABLY WARMER
THAN WE ARE.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.865
I BET SOME RICH SUGAR DADDY'S
TAKEN HIM HOME

12:44.898 --> 12:47.034
AND WRAPPED HIM
IN A CASHMERE COMFORTER

12:47.067 --> 12:48.936
AND IS FEEDING HIM
LOBSTER BISQUE SOUP.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.403
- [chuckles]

12:50.437 --> 12:52.405
WHAT VIVID IMAGERY.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.041
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
IN STAGE ONE HYPOTHERMIA--

12:54.074 --> 12:55.442
YOU START HALLUCINATING.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.410

12:57.444 --> 12:59.046

12:59.079 --> 13:00.881
- COME ON, DON'T BE SHY.
- WANT TO HANG OUT?

13:00.914 --> 13:02.916
- NO LOBSTER BISQUE SOUP.
- YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.217
- YOU CAN TASTE THE CHICKEN.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.218

FOR A BIT.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.020

- HEY!

13:12.325 --> 13:16.296
- HE'S NOT THE FUCKING COPS!

13:16.329 --> 13:17.965
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

13:17.998 --> 13:21.434
- WHY IS IT EVERY TIME
YOU SHOW UP, YOU COST ME MONEY?

13:21.468 --> 13:24.504
HE WAS EVEN WILLING TO SPRING
FOR A HOTEL ROOM.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.173
- IT'S IMPORTANT.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.441
- EVERYTHING WITH YOU
IS IMPORTANT.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.378
- YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO HIM.

13:32.545 --> 13:36.316
- NOW WHAT?

13:36.349 --> 13:37.584
- WHEN YOU WERE
IN THE HOSPITAL,

13:37.617 --> 13:40.921
THEY TESTED YOU FOR HIV,
AND...

13:40.954 --> 13:43.323
IT TURNS OUT
YOU'RE POSITIVE.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.258
- WE COULD HAVE A GOOD TIME,
MAN, COME ON.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.928
ME AND YOU,
WE CAN HANG OUT.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.963
- LOOK, I KNOW IT'S UPSETTING,

13:49.997 --> 13:52.199
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,
YOU'RE HEALTHY.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.466
YOUR VIRAL LOAD
IS UNDETECTABLE.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.935
WITH ALL THE NEW ADVANCES,
YOU--

13:54.968 --> 13:57.337
- THANKS FOR THE INFO.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.472
DON'T YOU EVEN CARE?

13:59.506 --> 14:00.974
- THAT I HAVE AIDS?

14:01.008 --> 14:03.343
- I DID NOT SAY AIDS.
I SAID HIV.

14:03.376 --> 14:04.878
- SO I HAVE IT.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.079
MOST OF THE GUYS OUT HERE
ALREADY DO.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.614
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.216
- NO, IT'S A VERY BIG DEAL.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.517
YOU HAVE TO LEARN
TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.385
- FUCK OFF!

14:12.419 --> 14:14.521
I HAVE WORK TO DO.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.389
- HEY, IF YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOURSELF,

14:16.423 --> 14:18.091
THEN WHAT ABOUT OTHERS?

14:18.125 --> 14:22.963
YOU COULD BE INFECTING
THE PEOPLE YOU SLEEP WITH.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.899
- YOU PAYS YOUR MONEY,
YOU TAKES YOUR CHANCES.

14:28.135 --> 14:30.170
- PRETTY COLD OUT HERE.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.638
YOU WANT TO WARM ME UP?

14:31.671 --> 14:33.106

14:36.209 --> 14:38.511
- THIS PASTRY WOULD BE
A HELL OF A LOT CRISPER

14:38.545 --> 14:40.313
WITH A PROFESSIONAL OVEN.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.515
- WELL, MISTER,

14:42.549 --> 14:44.651
THE KITCHEN FAIRY
JUST MAY GRANT YOUR WISH.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.253
AFTER THIS NEXT PARTY,

14:46.286 --> 14:48.521
I WILL HAVE SAVED UP ENOUGH
TO AFFORD ONE.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.124
- NOW WE'RE COOKING.
- HMM.

14:51.158 --> 14:54.594
- CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING
WORSE THAN A SOGGY CHEESE PUFF?

14:54.627 --> 14:55.996
- AS HARD AS I TRY,

14:56.029 --> 14:58.265
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
COMES TO MIND.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.333
[opera music playing]

15:00.367 --> 15:05.038

- CAREFUL.
DON'T BURN YOUR TONGUE.

- NOW YOU TELL ME?

15:19.052 --> 15:21.021
UH, WHAT DO YOU--

15:21.054 --> 15:22.689
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE ALL GO OUT TONIGHT?

UH, THE PITTSBURGH CIVIC
OPERA'S DOING ALL 20 HOURS

15:25.325 --> 15:26.726
OF WAGNER'S RING CYCLE.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.461
- MAYBE IF IT WERE
WAGNER'S COCK RING CYCLE.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.696
- [chuckles]

15:29.729 --> 15:31.331

A LANA TURNER MOVIE.

15:37.470 --> 15:41.108
I DON'T NEED TO SEE ONE.

ANYWAY, I'M MEETING RODNEY

TALENTED SON.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.647
[cheers and laughter]

16:20.680 --> 16:22.082
- HEY, SUNSHINE.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.283

16:23.316 --> 16:25.218
RESEARCHING
THOSE UNSOLVED CRIMES.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.154
- HOW'D YOU DO IT, SUNSHINE?

16:27.187 --> 16:28.621
- I HAVE MY "DEEP THROAT."

16:28.655 --> 16:31.224

I BET YOU DO.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.692
EXCUSE ME.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.385
- [sighs]
WELL...

16:58.418 --> 17:03.123
EVERY POLITICIAN HAS TO DEAL
WITH THE LUNATIC FRINGE.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.558
- YOU KNOW, IN THE OLD DAYS,
BEFORE YOU SOLD YOUR SOUL

17:05.592 --> 17:07.694
FOR A SACK OF GOLD,

17:07.727 --> 17:11.731
YOU'D HAVE BEEN THE ONE WHO LAID
THE TRAP FOR STOCKWELL.

17:11.764 --> 17:13.733
IN FACT, IT HAD THE HAND
OF THE MASTER

17:13.766 --> 17:16.536
WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.405
I GUESS THOSE DAYS ARE GONE.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.807
- HI.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.609

17:22.642 --> 17:24.144

LOOKING FOR HUNTER.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.614
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU MISSED QUITE A SHOW.

17:27.647 --> 17:31.218
YOUR MOM DOES
A GREAT NORMA RAE.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.719
- DID YOU FIND HIM?

17:32.752 --> 17:34.321
- BEN TOLD HIM
HE WAS POSITIVE.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.822
HE DIDN'T EVEN SEEM TO CARE.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.690
- HE'S A FUCKING HUSTLER.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

17:37.724 --> 17:39.092
- AT HIS AGE, HE PROBABLY
DOESN'T REALIZE

17:39.126 --> 17:40.627
THE CONSEQUENCES.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.862
- YOU'D THINK HE'D AT LEAST SHOW
SOME GRATITUDE

17:42.895 --> 17:44.297
FOR US TRYING TO HELP.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.732
- [chuckles]

17:45.765 --> 17:48.168
I'M SURE HE'LL WRITE YOU
A THANK-YOU NOTE

17:48.201 --> 17:49.836
FIRST CHANCE HE GETS.

17:49.869 --> 17:53.106
- IT WAS A VERY LOVING THING
YOU DID, SWEETHEART.

17:53.140 --> 17:56.075
EVEN IF SOME PEOPLE
DON'T THINK SO.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.714
- WELL, IF YOU'RE DONE DOING
YOUR GOOD DEED,

18:01.748 --> 18:04.751
HOW ABOUT PICKING UP A CUE?

18:07.887 --> 18:09.656
- YOU KNOW, WE'RE LUCKY.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.724
- WHAT, THAT OUR HAIRLINE
HASN'T STARTED TO RECEDE?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.726
- THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU HATED YOUR PARENTS

18:13.760 --> 18:17.530
OR HOW MUCH MY MOM
DRIVES ME CRAZY,

18:17.564 --> 18:19.499
THEY NEVER TRIED
TO GIVE US AWAY.

18:19.532 --> 18:22.702
- HUH.
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

18:36.916 --> 18:40.353
- THAT COAT
DOES NOT LOOK VERY WARM.

18:40.387 --> 18:43.290
- IT'S WARM ENOUGH.

18:45.858 --> 18:50.697
[sneezes]

18:50.730 --> 18:53.833
DID YOU ALREADY BLOW
YOUR NOSE IN IT?

18:53.866 --> 18:58.371
- NO, I DID NOT.

18:58.405 --> 18:59.906
[chuckles]

18:59.939 --> 19:02.942
I-I GOT AN OLD DOWN-FILL HERE.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.712
IT'S, UH,
IT'S STILL IN GOOD SHAPE.

19:05.745 --> 19:09.382
- NO ONE WANTS TO PICK UP A GUY
WHO LOOKS LIKE AN ESKIMO.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.817
- HEY, NO ONE WANTS
TO PICK UP A GUY

19:10.850 --> 19:12.952
WHO'S GOING TO GIVE HIM HIV
EITHER, SO...

19:12.985 --> 19:14.787
HERE.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.289
MAKE SURE YOU USE THESE,

19:16.323 --> 19:18.958
AND MAKE SURE
THEY USE THEM TOO, OKAY?

19:18.991 --> 19:22.161
EVEN IF THEY DO OFFER
TO PAY YOU $200.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.901
- HEY, WAIT!
COME BACK!

19:32.239 --> 19:35.242
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!
LEAVE ME ALONE!

19:44.984 --> 19:47.987
- FINE.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.189
- HEY.

19:51.991 --> 19:55.695
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

19:55.728 --> 19:57.964
WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE?

19:57.997 --> 20:00.900
- 'CAUSE I'M POSITIVE TOO.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.309
[moans, sniffing]

20:09.342 --> 20:12.245
- YEAH.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.720

20:33.666 --> 20:36.636
- NOW, I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO BE
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.346
- HE'S PLANNING A PARTY.
[coughs]

20:46.379 --> 20:49.516
- WELL, IT COULDN'T BE
AS HOT AS THIS ONE.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.884
- OH...

20:51.918 --> 20:55.622
JUST THE BLUE CHEESE
AND PEAR PUFFS.

20:55.655 --> 20:59.025
- SPEAKING OF PARTIES...

20:59.058 --> 21:01.328
IT'S WHITE PARTY WEEKEND.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.630
- YEAH? WHERE?
[laughter]

21:03.663 --> 21:05.031
- WHERE ELSE?

21:05.064 --> 21:08.901
P.S., I LOVE YOU.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.671
PALM SPRINGS, THE DESERT.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.773
- HOT, HOT, HOT!

21:13.806 --> 21:15.308
- THAT'S RIGHT, DARLING--
THE HOTTEST MUSIC,

21:15.342 --> 21:19.779
THE HOTTEST DRUGS,
AND THE HOTTEST BOYS.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.415
- WOW.
- NICE.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.651
- YOU WANNA GO?

21:24.684 --> 21:25.985
- [laughs]

21:26.018 --> 21:27.920
TO A CIRCUIT PARTY
IN PALM SPRINGS?

21:27.954 --> 21:29.422
- WELL, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO A CIRCUIT PARTY

21:29.456 --> 21:30.657
IN PALM SPRINGS?

21:30.690 --> 21:32.659
- NO.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.527
- WELL, THEN,
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT IT.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.863
IMAGINE TENS OF THOUSANDS

21:36.896 --> 21:40.933
OF THE MOST GORGEOUS MEN
YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.870
YOU'LL GET HARD THE SECOND
YOU WALK THROUGH THE DOOR.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.838
AND THE FAVORS--

21:45.872 --> 21:48.608
ANY KIND YOU WANT,
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.444
YOU'RE FLOATING.
YOU'RE...

21:51.478 --> 21:54.414
HORNY.

21:54.447 --> 21:57.817
AND EVERYWHERE YOU TURN,

21:57.850 --> 22:00.420
THERE'S SOMEONE THERE
TO SUCK YOU OR STROKE YOU.

22:00.453 --> 22:03.089
AND THE WEATHER!

22:03.122 --> 22:06.593
FUCK THIS SNOW
AND SLEET SHIT.

22:06.626 --> 22:09.629
THERE'S A SOFT BREEZE BLOWING,

22:09.662 --> 22:11.631
EVEN AT 2:00
IN THE MORNING,

22:11.664 --> 22:14.033
AND EVERYTHING'S
WHITE, WHITE,

22:14.066 --> 22:15.768
WHITE.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.370
SO WHITE, IT GLOWS.

22:17.404 --> 22:20.473
[laughter]

22:20.507 --> 22:22.775
IT'S MORE THAN AN OASIS.
IT'S, UH, WELL...

22:22.809 --> 22:24.711
[zipper unzips]

22:24.744 --> 22:26.012
HEAVEN.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.514
AND IF THE REAL HEAVEN

22:27.547 --> 22:31.518
ISN'T ANYTHING LIKE IT...

22:31.551 --> 22:34.053
DAMN WELL SHOULD BE.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.155
- [breathing heavily]

22:36.188 --> 22:37.790
THAT SOUNDS AMAZING,

22:37.824 --> 22:40.059
BUT, UH...

22:40.092 --> 22:42.995
- BUT, UH, WHAT?
IT'S ALL THERE WAITING FOR US.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.597
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS PICK UP THE PHONE

22:44.631 --> 22:46.065
AND CALL MY TRAVEL AGENT.

22:46.098 --> 22:48.935
SEE, I'M, UH,
I'M TEFLON-ING HIS NOSE.

22:48.968 --> 22:51.538
[chuckles]
HE'S GOT A NASTY COKE HABIT.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.473
HE'LL GET US A GREAT DEAL.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.875
WON'T COST MORE
THAN A FEW THOU'.

22:55.908 --> 22:59.178
YOU CAN SPARE A FEW THOU',
CAN'T YOU?

22:59.211 --> 23:01.981
- [breathing heavily]

23:08.855 --> 23:10.156
- OKAY.

23:10.189 --> 23:13.125
HAVE SOME MISO SOUP.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.529
- WHAT'S THAT?

23:16.563 --> 23:18.665
- OH, IT'S...

23:18.698 --> 23:21.668
JAPANESE CHICKEN SOUP.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.536
COME ON, JUST EAT IT.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.973
JUST TAKE IT AND...

23:37.684 --> 23:39.919
- SO HOW LONG
HAVE YOU HAD IT?

23:39.952 --> 23:42.088
- UH...

23:42.121 --> 23:45.558
I TESTED POSITIVE
THREE YEARS AGO,

23:45.592 --> 23:48.060
AND SO FAR, KNOCK WOOD,
I HAVE BEEN HEALTHY.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.429
- SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

23:52.599 --> 23:54.534
- STAYING THAT WAY.

23:54.567 --> 23:57.203
IT TAKES A LOT MORE WORK
THAN YOU THINK,

23:57.236 --> 24:00.072
NOT TO MENTION DEALING
WITH THE SOCIAL AND--

24:00.106 --> 24:02.141
AND PSYCHOLOGICAL
RAMIFICATIONS.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.577
- I'M A KID, REMEMBER?

24:06.513 --> 24:09.849
YOU MIND TALKING DOWN TO ME?

24:09.882 --> 24:12.585
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

24:12.619 --> 24:17.256
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.759
- I UNDERSTAND.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.227
BUT AT SOME POINT,
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.595
[door opens]

24:22.629 --> 24:24.697
- HEY.
SORRY I'M LATE.

24:24.731 --> 24:26.899
I WAS AT WOODY'S
WITH EVERY--

24:26.933 --> 24:29.902
- HEY.
UH, COME ON IN.

24:29.936 --> 24:33.172
- I DIDN'T REALIZE
WE HAD COMPANY.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.908
- YEAH, I, UH,

24:35.942 --> 24:38.044
I OFFERED HUNTER, UH,
SOMETHING HOT TO EAT

24:38.077 --> 24:40.747
AND A PLACE TO CRASH.

24:40.780 --> 24:44.784
- THAT WAS A VERY LOVING THING
YOU DID, SWEETHEART.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.822
- [loud slurping]

24:55.628 --> 24:57.063
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.932
- WE'RE DOING THIS.
- NO, YOU'RE DOING THIS.

24:59.966 --> 25:01.801
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU TELL HIM, ANYWAY?

25:01.834 --> 25:03.135
- THAT HE COULD STAY HERE.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.304
- FOR HOW LONG?

25:05.337 --> 25:07.674
- I DID NOT GIVE IT
A TIME LIMIT.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.042
- WE'RE NOT CHINA.
THERE'S NO OPEN DOOR POLICY.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.278
- [chuckles]
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

25:12.311 --> 25:15.782
- OH, THAT IS
SUCH A MOTHER THING TO SAY,

25:15.815 --> 25:17.650
AND YOUR MOTHER
MUST HAVE SAID THAT.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.185
- MY MOTHER'S NEVER HEARD
OF THE OPEN DOOR POLICY,

25:19.218 --> 25:20.753
AND THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

25:20.787 --> 25:23.623
- THE POINT IS HE JUST GOT OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.057
HE'S JUST FOUND OUT
HE'S POSITIVE.

25:25.091 --> 25:26.793
AM I SUPPOSED TO LET HIM SLEEP
ON THE STREET

25:26.826 --> 25:28.227
ON ONE OF THE COLDEST NIGHTS
OF THE YEAR?

25:28.260 --> 25:30.162
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.765
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU PLAN TO DO.

25:32.799 --> 25:34.767
- RIGHT NOW,
I'M OFFERING A HELPING HAND

25:34.801 --> 25:36.102
TO SOMEONE WHO NEEDS IT.

25:36.135 --> 25:37.336
- YOU HARDLY KNOW HIM.

25:37.369 --> 25:40.907
- NO, ACTUALLY,
WE'RE RELATED.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.910
BY BLOOD.

25:43.943 --> 25:46.178
- * DON'T STRAIN YOURSELF

25:46.212 --> 25:49.582
- [sighs]
WOW.

25:49.616 --> 25:52.318
THAT'S A REAL BEAUTY.

25:52.351 --> 25:57.056
- YEAH, I'M KIND OF PROUD
OF IT MYSELF.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.791
- WHERE SHOULD WE STICK IT?

25:58.825 --> 26:00.359
- MM, CITY HALL,

26:00.392 --> 26:01.828
POLICE HEADQUARTERS,

26:01.861 --> 26:02.962
UP HIS ASS.

26:02.995 --> 26:04.363
- [chuckles]

26:04.396 --> 26:06.833
- WE'LL ANNIHILATE
THE FUCKER.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.135
- AH, DON'T BE SO SURE.
IT'S ONLY A POSTER.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.336
- "ONLY"?

26:10.369 --> 26:12.939
LAST ONE SENT HIM
AROUND THE BEND.

26:12.972 --> 26:15.942
THEY EVEN WROTE AN EDITORIAL
ABOUT IT IN THE PAPER.

26:15.975 --> 26:17.810
THINK OF THE STINK
WHEN THEY SEE THIS ONE.

26:17.844 --> 26:21.681
- * WHY YOU DAMN FOOL

26:21.714 --> 26:25.818
* GET AWAY FROM ME

26:25.852 --> 26:29.622
- HOW DID YOU GET TO BE
SUCH A CLEVER DEVIL?

26:29.656 --> 26:34.126
- LEARNED FROM THE MASTER.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.964
- * IN A FUN HOUSE MIRROR

26:37.997 --> 26:42.068
* SWEAR UP AND DOWN

26:45.872 --> 26:50.376
- THANKS FOR MEETING ME
AT THIS HOUR.

26:50.409 --> 26:52.712
- YOU SAID YOU NEEDED
TO SPEAK TO ME

26:52.745 --> 26:54.113
PERSONALLY AND CONFIDENTIALLY.

26:54.146 --> 26:56.115
- THAT'S RIGHT.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.316
- WOULD YOU LIKE SOME?

26:57.349 --> 26:58.851
- I DON'T DRINK.

26:58.885 --> 27:00.920
- THANK GOD I DO.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.722
- I'VE BECOME AWARE
OF A SITUATION

27:02.755 --> 27:06.392
WITHIN MY CAMPAIGN...

27:06.425 --> 27:08.260
THAT THERE'S SOMEONE
I'VE WORKED WITH CLOSELY,

27:08.294 --> 27:12.331
SOMEONE I'VE TRUSTED,
WHO'S WORKING AGAINST ME.

27:12.364 --> 27:14.801
- THAT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.036
BUT WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME?

27:17.069 --> 27:18.738
- IT'S KINNEY.

27:18.771 --> 27:21.007
- BRIAN?

27:21.040 --> 27:23.075
[laughs]
THAT'S LUDICROUS.

27:23.109 --> 27:24.777
BRIAN WOULD NEVER--

27:24.811 --> 27:27.413
- I'M A COP.
I KNOW WHEN I'M BEING SET UP.

27:27.446 --> 27:30.216
HE SENT ME INTO THAT FIASCO
AT THE GAY AND LESBIAN CENTER

27:30.249 --> 27:34.220
KNOWING EXACTLY
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.888
- AND WHAT MAKES YOU
SO SURE?

27:35.922 --> 27:40.159
- THAT KID WHO WAS SHOUTING OUT
THOSE NAMES,

27:40.192 --> 27:43.029
A JUSTIN TAYLOR,

27:43.062 --> 27:44.831
I KNEW I'D SEEN HIM
SOMEWHERE BEFORE.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.899
THEN I REMEMBERED...

27:46.933 --> 27:48.434
IT WAS HERE.

27:48.467 --> 27:50.837
- * ONE THOUGHT

27:50.870 --> 27:52.905
* GETS CAUGHT

27:52.939 --> 27:56.108
* IT ESCAPES
IN A SINGLE WORD *

27:56.142 --> 27:58.110
* TOO LATE

27:58.144 --> 27:59.779
* TO CHEAT FATE

27:59.812 --> 28:03.049
* ONCE IT'S DONE,
CAN'T RUN AWAY *

28:03.082 --> 28:04.350
* THIS DANCE

28:04.383 --> 28:09.188
- HE'S AN INTERN
IN OUR ART DEPARTMENT.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.057
- AND THEY WERE BOTH THERE
TONIGHT.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.124
- * SO CRUEL

28:12.158 --> 28:14.994
* LIKE A FOOL

28:15.027 --> 28:16.996
* HIDING
IN A PRIVATE PARADISE *

28:17.029 --> 28:19.832
- THAT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN
WHY BRIAN WOULD DO SUCH A THING.

28:19.866 --> 28:23.135
- BECAUSE HE'S A FAG.

28:23.169 --> 28:25.271
- * SO CRUEL

28:25.304 --> 28:27.406
* LIKE A FOOL

28:27.439 --> 28:29.809
* HIDING
IN A PRIVATE PARADISE *

28:29.842 --> 28:30.977
- [laughs]

28:31.010 --> 28:34.480
- * ONLY UNDER MY RULE

28:34.513 --> 28:39.886
* HIDING
IN A PRIVATE PARADISE *

28:39.919 --> 28:43.022
* A PRIVATE PARADISE

28:43.055 --> 28:46.993
* A PRIVATE PARADISE

28:47.026 --> 28:48.828
- HE'S GOT TOO MUCH INVESTED
IN YOUR CAMPAIGN.

28:48.861 --> 28:51.430
THIS ENTIRE AGENCY DOES.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.499
WHY WOULD HE SABOTAGE IT?

28:53.532 --> 28:56.502
- ALL I KNOW IS
I WANT HIM GONE.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.537
- * YOU'RE TOO LATE
TO CHEAT FATE *

28:58.570 --> 29:02.141
- THAT MIGHT PROVE
A BIT DIFFICULT.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.843
YOU'VE REFERRED TO HIM
IN THE PRESS

29:03.876 --> 29:05.244
AS THE GAY MEMBER
OF YOUR TEAM

29:05.277 --> 29:08.915
AND AS YOUR CLOSE FRIEND
AND PERSONAL ADVISOR.

29:08.948 --> 29:11.984
- ONE GUESS WHOSE IDEA
IT WAS TO DO THAT.

29:12.018 --> 29:14.520
- * YOU'RE TOO LATE
TO CHEAT FATE *

29:14.553 --> 29:17.256
[moaning]

29:17.289 --> 29:20.026
[knock at door]

29:20.059 --> 29:23.529
- CHRIST.

29:23.562 --> 29:25.431
NEVER A MOMENT'S REST.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.433
[banging at door]

29:33.973 --> 29:37.243
[banging continues]

29:55.928 --> 29:58.264
[sighs]

30:05.271 --> 30:06.906
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

30:06.939 --> 30:11.077
HAVEN'T YOU EVER SEEN TWO GUYS
FUCKING BEFORE?

30:11.110 --> 30:13.412
- [clears throat]

30:16.615 --> 30:18.550
- [exhales]

30:29.962 --> 30:31.864
- [sighs]

30:41.373 --> 30:44.977
- WANNA FINISH?

30:45.011 --> 30:46.946
- WE CAN'T JUST STICK
AROUND HERE ALL DAY

30:46.979 --> 30:48.614
KEEPING AN EYE ON HIM.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.349
- WELL, THEN WE'LL TELL HIM
HE CAN COME BACK TONIGHT,

30:50.382 --> 30:52.351
AFTER WE GET HOME, OKAY?

30:52.384 --> 30:53.352
HEY.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.487
HOW'D YOU SLEEP?

30:55.521 --> 30:58.124
- ANY COFFEE?

30:58.157 --> 30:59.358
- YEAH, HELP YOURSELF.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.961
[sirens wailing
in the distance]

31:01.994 --> 31:05.965
- [grunts]

31:05.998 --> 31:07.633
- SO ARE YOU OFF TO SCHOOL?

31:07.666 --> 31:09.101
- YEAH!
GOTTA MAKE GOOD GRADES

31:09.135 --> 31:11.037
IF I WANT TO GET
INTO HARVARD.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.505
- I TAKE IT
THAT'S A NO.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.107
- YOU GO TO SCHOOL,
DON'T YOU?

31:15.141 --> 31:18.877
- WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU,
MY SOCIAL WORKER?

31:20.412 --> 31:22.681
- WORSE.
HE'S A TEACHER.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.917
- UH, AND YOU OUGHT TO HAVE
A REAL BREAKFAST.

31:24.951 --> 31:27.653
LET ME--LET ME FIX YOU
A PROTEIN SHAKE.

31:27.686 --> 31:30.990
- HE'S ALSO
A HEALTH FREAK.

31:31.023 --> 31:33.926
- I CAN TELL ALREADY.
THIS ISN'T MY DAY.

31:36.162 --> 31:37.696
- LISTEN.
[clears throat]

31:37.729 --> 31:39.431
LISTEN, BEN AND I
ARE GOING TO WORK,

31:39.465 --> 31:42.401
SO YOU--
YOU GOTTA LEAVE.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.204
- YEAH, BUT WE'LL, UH,
BE BACK AROUND 7:00.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.406
SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE DINNER,
SPEND THE NIGHT,

31:47.439 --> 31:48.674
WE'LL BE HERE.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.542
- HOPEFULLY, I'LL HAVE A TRICK

31:50.576 --> 31:53.012
WHO'S PAYING ME
TO SLEEP THERE.

31:53.045 --> 31:54.546
- WELL, IF YOU DON'T,

31:54.580 --> 31:56.182
MAKE SURE YOU SHOW UP
BEFORE MIDNIGHT,

31:56.215 --> 31:57.316
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHEN WE LOCK THE DOOR.

31:57.349 --> 32:00.552
- [scoffs]
A CURFEW?

32:00.586 --> 32:02.488
YOU'RE AS BAD AS SOME
OF MY FOSTER PARENTS.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.457
- MAYBE SOME OF THEM
WEREN'T SO BAD.

32:13.132 --> 32:16.435
HEY.

32:16.468 --> 32:17.703
BEFORE YOU GO
ON YOUR MERRY WAY,

32:17.736 --> 32:19.238
I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.740
NOT FOR MYSELF,
BUT FOR BEN.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.442
- I TOLD YOU
I'D DO YOU BOTH.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.244
ALONE, TOGETHER.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.478
HELL, I'LL EVEN DO YOU
FOR HALF PRICE

32:26.512 --> 32:28.314
JUST TO SHOW
MY APPRECIATION.

32:28.347 --> 32:31.183
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS GOING
TO ASK YOU.

32:31.217 --> 32:34.120
I WANT TO KNOW
IF YOU'RE COMING BACK.

32:34.153 --> 32:37.523
I DON'T THINK YOU ARE,
BUT BEN THINKS OTHERWISE.

32:37.556 --> 32:39.458
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY HE HAS
MORE FAITH IN HUMANITY,

32:39.491 --> 32:43.062
OR AT LEAST IN YOU,
THAN I DO.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.997
ANYWAY, I...
[sighs]

32:45.031 --> 32:46.598
I WOULD HATE TO SEE HIM
GET HURT,

32:46.632 --> 32:49.735
SO IF YOU DON'T PLAN
ON RETURNING, JUST SAY SO NOW,

32:49.768 --> 32:52.138
AND I'LL TELL HIM
NOT TO EXPECT YOU.

32:52.171 --> 32:56.075
- ALL I ASKED WAS FOR HIM
TO SAY HE WAS MY UNCLE.

32:56.108 --> 33:00.479
I NEVER ASKED FOR THE FREE MEAL,
THE BED, THE COAT.

33:00.512 --> 33:03.015
I SURE AS HELL DIDN'T ASK
TO HEAR I'M POSITIVE,

33:03.049 --> 33:05.984
SO HE CAN KEEP
HIS FUCKING HELP.

33:11.123 --> 33:14.026
- I'LL LET HIM KNOW.

33:17.263 --> 33:19.098
- YOU'VE PUT ME
IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.499
I HOPE YOU REALIZE THAT.
- YEAH, ALMOST AS DIFFICULT

33:20.532 --> 33:24.636
AS THE ONE I WAS IN
WHEN YOU SHOWED UP.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.272
- EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE A PARTNER
IN THIS AGENCY,

33:26.305 --> 33:28.307
I'M STILL THE CEO
AND MAJOR SHAREHOLDER,

33:28.340 --> 33:30.509
AND THERE ARE LIMITS
TO WHAT YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.178
- LOOK, IF STOCKWELL'S
GOT A PROBLEM,

33:32.211 --> 33:33.379
HE CAN CONFRONT ME DIRECTLY.

33:33.412 --> 33:34.680
- [chuckles]

33:34.713 --> 33:36.682
AFTER WHAT HE SAW LAST NIGHT?

33:36.715 --> 33:38.184
TO SAY THAT YOU WERE CAUGHT
WITH YOUR PANTS DOWN

33:38.217 --> 33:39.518
IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

33:39.551 --> 33:42.554
- OKAY, SO YOU FOUND ME
FUCKING THE INTERN.

33:42.588 --> 33:44.790

33:48.727 --> 33:50.296

WHAT WOULD HAPPEN!

33:53.165 --> 33:55.567

34:00.439 --> 34:02.174
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

34:02.208 --> 34:05.177
- I WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU WOULD DO SUCH A THING.

34:05.211 --> 34:08.514
SACRIFICE YOUR FUTURE, AS WELL
AS THIS AGENCY'S, FOR WHAT?

34:10.716 --> 34:12.151

34:12.184 --> 34:13.552

34:13.585 --> 34:16.054

34:17.589 --> 34:19.825
- BECAUSE YOU'RE STRAIGHT.

34:19.858 --> 34:23.195
- [scoffs]

34:23.229 --> 34:26.432
WHATEVER THE REASON,

34:26.465 --> 34:29.368
YOU JUST FUCKED YOURSELF
OUT OF A JOB.

34:33.472 --> 34:34.706
- HE SAID HE WAS GOING
TO WOODY'S

34:34.740 --> 34:37.443
TO HAVE A DRINK
WITH YOU AND BEN.

34:37.476 --> 34:40.246
HE DIDN'T?

34:40.279 --> 34:43.515
WELL, HE DIDN'T COME HOME LAST
NIGHT, AND HE HASN'T CALLED.

34:43.549 --> 34:46.185
MICHAEL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

34:46.218 --> 34:49.621

35:14.780 --> 35:17.283

TO DRINK?

35:23.422 --> 35:25.391

35:52.984 --> 35:55.521
- SO MUCH BETTER, THANKS.

HE'S BEEN BUSY

35:58.424 --> 36:00.959

THE RIGHT INVESTMENT, SO--

36:00.992 --> 36:03.395

ALL THE MONEY IN GUS' SAVINGS
ACCOUNT'S BEEN WITHDRAWN.

36:05.697 --> 36:08.334

36:08.367 --> 36:09.935

TO WATCH MONEY.

AN ANTI-SEMITIC REMARK?

ABOUT TO SPLIT 300 FOR 1.

ISN'T GOING TO SHIT.

42:05.056 --> 42:06.291
- * ALL I WANT IS...

42:06.324 --> 42:09.761
- THE WORLD'S GOING TO SHIT.
- YEAH.

42:09.795 --> 42:10.829
I COULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT.

42:10.862 --> 42:14.299
- * RISING OF THE SUN

42:14.332 --> 42:18.837
- SO LAY OFF
THE BAD BOY ROUTINE,

42:18.870 --> 42:22.808
'CAUSE YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR IT,
AND...

42:22.841 --> 42:25.977
IT ISN'T TRUE.

42:26.011 --> 42:27.979
- ANYTHING ELSE?

42:28.013 --> 42:29.114
- YEAH.

42:29.147 --> 42:31.116

*

42:40.859 --> 42:44.696
- * WISH I COULD DEPEND

42:50.736 --> 42:55.206
- I KNOW, I KNOW.
HE'S NOT COMING BACK.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.944
- YOU REALLY SURPRISED?

42:58.977 --> 43:01.813
- YEAH, I GUESS I AM.

43:01.847 --> 43:03.982
I FELT THERE WERE MOMENTS--

43:04.015 --> 43:06.117
A FLICKER IN HIS EYE,

43:06.151 --> 43:07.886
A PAUSE BEFORE HE'D ANSWER--

43:07.919 --> 43:09.354
WHEN I THOUGHT
SOMETHING REGISTERED,

43:09.387 --> 43:13.091
THAT I WAS ACTUALLY...

43:13.124 --> 43:14.826
GETTING THROUGH TO HIM.

43:14.860 --> 43:16.695
CALL ME CRAZY.

43:16.728 --> 43:18.697
- YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.

43:18.730 --> 43:20.365
YOU'RE JUST KIND.

43:20.398 --> 43:24.102
- HMM.

43:24.135 --> 43:26.838
WELL, LET'S, UH,

43:26.872 --> 43:28.840
HOPE HE'S BEING CAREFUL,

43:28.874 --> 43:32.110
THAT HE AT LEAST HEARD
THAT MUCH.

43:32.143 --> 43:34.145
- WE CAN ALWAYS HOPE.

43:40.886 --> 43:43.154
- THERE'S ALWAYS UNEMPLOYMENT.

43:43.188 --> 43:45.123
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD WRITE
YOUR MEMOIRS.

43:45.156 --> 43:47.292
THERE SEEMS TO BE AN ENDLESS
FASCINATION AMONG THE MASSES

43:47.325 --> 43:49.427
WITH REVELING IN THE DOWNFALL
OF THE ONCE MIGHTY.

43:49.460 --> 43:50.862

43:50.896 --> 43:52.197
WELL, THANKS
FOR THE CAREER TIPS,

43:52.230 --> 43:53.765
BUT I THINK I'LL JUST GO
TO BABYLON

43:53.799 --> 43:55.801
AND FUCK MY BRAINS OUT.

43:55.834 --> 43:58.904
- THINK AGAIN.
BACK ROOM'S CLOSED.

43:58.937 --> 44:00.739
- [sighs]

44:00.772 --> 44:02.273
WELL, THE HELL IF WE'RE GOING
TO STAND AROUND BARE-ASS

44:02.307 --> 44:05.877
IN THE BACK OF AN 18-WHEELER
WHEN IT'S 12 DEGREES.

44:05.911 --> 44:08.213
- I COULD ALWAYS MAKE
MY MOTHER'S MEAT LOAF, HONEY,

44:08.246 --> 44:09.781
AND WE COULD LOOK AT PHOTOS

44:09.815 --> 44:13.418
FROM WHEN WE TOOK THE KIDS
TO DISNEY WORLD.

44:13.451 --> 44:15.153
- I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

- ALL I CAN SAY IS,
HE'D BETTER BE HERE.

44:42.814 --> 44:43.982
- YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
HE RAN OFF

44:44.015 --> 44:45.851
WITH GUS' COLLEGE FUND.

44:45.884 --> 44:48.086
THAT'S NOT TED.

44:48.119 --> 44:49.788
- THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU.

44:49.821 --> 44:53.024

WHO TED IS ANYMORE.

44:55.360 --> 44:58.329
YOU SEE HIM?

44:58.363 --> 45:00.098

45:16.314 --> 45:20.952
- EXCUSE ME.

45:20.986 --> 45:24.089
I SAID, EXCUSE ME.

45:24.122 --> 45:26.958
MY NAME'S EMMETT.

45:26.992 --> 45:29.260

45:41.940 --> 45:44.109
SEE, HE DIDN'T COME HOME
LAST NIGHT.

45:44.142 --> 45:46.011
H-HE DIDN'T EVEN CALL,

45:46.044 --> 45:47.846
AND I'M WORRIED
THAT HE MIGHT BE--

45:47.879 --> 45:50.281
- HE WENT TO PALM SPRINGS.

45:50.315 --> 45:52.150
- WHAT?

45:52.183 --> 45:53.985
- WE WERE TWEAKING

45:56.421 --> 45:58.189
