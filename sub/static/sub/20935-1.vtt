00:47.448 --> 00:49.478
Where the hell did things go wrong?

00:51.552 --> 00:53.352
How did things change so quickly?

00:55.423 --> 00:57.063
I had so many questions.

00:59.260 --> 01:02.330
Some might blame karma, kismet, fate or destiny,

01:02.363 --> 01:04.833
but those are just good stripper names to me.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.443
Well, except maybe kismet.

01:08.269 --> 01:11.239
I believe it's the choices we make that determine our future

01:11.739 --> 01:12.739
- nothing else.

01:41.669 --> 01:42.239
Jack.

01:42.270 --> 01:42.870
Wilson!

01:42.903 --> 01:44.343
Peacock's lost man.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.672
You are gonna bang it in London town.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.136
You smack that royal baby for me alright?

01:47.175 --> 01:48.535
Thank, man.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.176
In the mean time, I don't know how I'm going

01:50.211 --> 01:51.611
to survive without you.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.205
You know I got these abandonment issues right?

01:53.247 --> 01:54.747
You'll survive, Wilson.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.152
Really cause I, can I ask you?

01:57.185 --> 01:59.215
Does this look infected to you?

01:59.253 --> 02:00.753
Ahhh!

02:00.788 --> 02:04.228
Please see a doctor Wilson, I got a lot of shit to do.

02:50.938 --> 02:54.538
You want, uhh, fries with that?

02:54.575 --> 02:57.645
Okay, two fries and two onion rings, okay.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.448
So, that would be four cheeseburgers.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.176
Do you want some?

03:06.654 --> 03:07.794
Thank you, dear.

03:30.478 --> 03:32.808
I need you to pretend that you're with me.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.716
See that woman over there?

03:34.748 --> 03:36.918
Don't look!

03:36.950 --> 03:41.790
She's my ex, and I can't be seen alone.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.662
Yeah no, if you don't mind.

03:43.691 --> 03:44.491
Thanks, I owe you.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.855
Let me buy you a slice of apple pie.

03:46.894 --> 03:50.034
This place has the best apple pie on the west side.

03:50.063 --> 03:50.933
All right, nice try.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.534
I'm sure this works for you all the time.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.037
But I'm really not interested, alright?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.838
I just want to be left alone.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.771
Jack?

03:59.807 --> 04:00.907
Meagan.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.483
How have you been?

04:08.582 --> 04:09.982
Ah, great.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.747
Things are goin' great.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.955
Aw, you don't have to lie to me, Jacky.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.358
I heard you were going through a rough time.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.331
Just be positive.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.899
Jack, this is Arnold, my husband.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.029
Hey.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.703
Wow, uhh-

04:25.733 --> 04:27.703
Congratulations.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.895
If at first you don't succeed, you get a bigger ring.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.938
Arnold is an entertainment lawyer.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.743
He does very well for himself.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.409
Well. aren't you going to introduce

04:38.446 --> 04:40.746
me to your little friend?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.285
Actually-

04:47.755 --> 04:51.285
I'm Maria, Jack's fiancé.

04:53.126 --> 04:57.666
Wow, if at first you don't succeed.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.898
I guess things are going better for you, Jack.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.343
Yeah.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.739
I'm Meagan, Jack's ex wife.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.712
You never told me you were ever married.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.511
We've been going together for three months

05:09.543 --> 05:11.983
and he's never mentioned you.

05:12.012 --> 05:15.682
You are lucky you are so incredibly sexy.

05:16.717 --> 05:17.387
Ow!

05:18.051 --> 05:20.021
Well, we should get going.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.663
It was nice meeting you.

05:21.689 --> 05:22.619
Bye Jack.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.816
Bye Meagan.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.025
Come on.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.058
Great seeing you again!

05:29.897 --> 05:31.567
Could you stare any harder?

05:31.599 --> 05:32.729
Seriously.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.838
Thank you for that.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.641
Ahh, she deserved it.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.713
Yeah.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.041
Yeah, she kinda did.

05:43.143 --> 05:46.953
Uhh, now can I buy you that apple pie?

05:46.980 --> 05:49.150
Uh, I should get going.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.782
You can call your fiancé.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.948
I'll buy him a slice too.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.461
Come on huh, it's the least I could do.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.860
I-I'm leaving the country in what-

05:59.893 --> 06:01.433
Less than six hours.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.632
This is my only chance to repay you.

06:05.098 --> 06:05.968
Look.

06:07.668 --> 06:08.838
One way.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.739
Why, one way?

06:10.771 --> 06:12.471
You're kind of nosey, huh?

06:16.944 --> 06:17.984
Okay.

06:24.985 --> 06:25.945
A fresh start.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.560
How long has it been?

06:28.589 --> 06:29.989
Two years.

06:30.023 --> 06:33.493
And two years married, two years divorced.

06:33.527 --> 06:37.767
She uhh, she left when the goin' got tough.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.068
But she's not the reason I'm leaving.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.200
After looking for work for a while

06:43.236 --> 06:46.606
I finally landed a two year contract, in London.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.540
I'm a writer.

06:47.575 --> 06:48.705
Oh, yeah?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.582
Are you a novelist?

06:50.611 --> 06:51.551
No.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.676
A journalist?

06:53.714 --> 06:54.654
Nope.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.176
You write for the movies, don't you?

06:57.217 --> 06:58.147
Uh uh.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.715
I write sitcoms.

07:00.854 --> 07:01.594
Oh.

07:02.656 --> 07:05.026
Jesus, you look more disappointed than my father.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.128
Oh no.

07:06.159 --> 07:06.989
Sorry.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.457
I didn't mean to.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.556
Do you remember the show "My Two Dicks"?

07:10.598 --> 07:14.098
A family comedy about a mother and her two detective sons,

07:14.602 --> 07:16.642
Lasted twelve episodes four years ago.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.512
I'm afraid I'm not familiar.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.142
Ah, don't sweat it.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.506
Neither was anybody else.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.916
"My Two Dicks" sucked.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.594
That's not what you said when you picked me up

07:33.621 --> 07:34.921
at the diner that night!

07:34.955 --> 07:36.215
I picked you up?!

07:36.256 --> 07:38.726
I'm pretty sure it was the other way around.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.629
I was the damsel in distress.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.531
Mmm, maybe.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.903
I had a really good time tonight, Jack.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.136
Good, I'm glad somebody did.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.941
The whole evening was pretty touch and go for me so.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.814
Are you ever serious?

07:55.843 --> 07:59.953
I tried it once, but it just didn't take.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.480
So uhh, it was worth it?

08:03.851 --> 08:04.891
Yeah, maybe.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.856
Good night, Jack.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.626
Uhh, wait.

08:18.165 --> 08:21.125
Do you need me to come up and you know, fix anything?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.598
Nothing's broken.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.036
I could help you watch tv?

08:24.071 --> 08:25.841
I've got twenty-twenty vision, right here.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.273
Be a shame to waste it.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.277
Goodnight, Jack.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.517
You've got to be kidding me?

08:37.585 --> 08:38.815
I kid you not.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.152
Six-years-old and he says to me, Miss Moniz,

08:41.188 --> 08:43.818
this is the worst day of education in my life!

08:43.857 --> 08:45.727
And he storms out of my classroom.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.870
I'm glad you stayed for pie.

08:53.066 --> 08:53.926
Me too.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.195
Umm.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.267
Can I uhh-

08:58.305 --> 09:00.105
Can I ask you something?

09:00.307 --> 09:01.977
You can try.

09:02.643 --> 09:06.613
Well, when I first walked in here, umm, you were crying.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.279
I wasn't crying.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.224
I have a little confession to make.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.086
I'm not really engaged anymore.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.926
I just broke up with my fiancé

09:20.961 --> 09:24.001
and I just, I haven't given him back the ring yet.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.801
I know, I know, I'm a horrible person.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.244
You're not a horrible person, okay.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.638
You're my hero.

09:30.671 --> 09:34.741
I guess I was just kinda holding on to the past.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.075
If that makes any sense to you?

09:37.110 --> 09:39.210
It's perfect sense.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.646
It's like the moment you break-up with someone,

09:42.683 --> 09:45.293
this movie of all the good times plays over and over

09:45.318 --> 09:48.718
in your head, and the bad times,

09:48.756 --> 09:50.986
they just fade away until you can't remember

09:51.024 --> 09:52.734
what the problem was.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.630
That's why I started recording negative moments

09:55.663 --> 09:58.073
of all my relationships so I wouldn't forget.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.773
You do not!

10:05.105 --> 10:06.105
You do.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.369
I don't, no I don't.

10:08.909 --> 10:13.379
Ah, okay.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.282
Oh, come on gimmie a smile, Megs.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.187
Here's a clip of Meagan rolling her eyes at me.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.020
That's like her signature move.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.855
As if I just said the world's stupidest thing.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.262
See.

10:26.293 --> 10:30.733
And ah, here's a clip of April taking an hour

10:30.764 --> 10:33.904
to put on her make up, that's me sitting on the couch,

10:33.934 --> 10:36.304
look how pissed I look.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.006
And um, oh.

10:39.773 --> 10:43.013
This is one of Alexis, now Alexis was a vegan,

10:43.043 --> 10:45.183
which in itself didn't bother me.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.822
However vegetables always made her a little

10:48.248 --> 10:48.978
Oh.

10:52.385 --> 10:56.785
I know it sounds nuts, but I bet you wish you had some,

10:56.824 --> 10:59.834
you know, video of your ex pickin' his nose or something.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.130
No.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.304
More like clearing his throat.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.903
Ah ha!

11:07.935 --> 11:09.695
You mean like uhh, like uhh,

11:09.737 --> 11:10.337
Ahem?

11:10.370 --> 11:11.440
No, more like.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.243
No, no with more throat, like.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.110
Oh my god, that's annoying.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.045
Isn't it?!

11:23.817 --> 11:26.147
You are something else, Jack-

11:26.419 --> 11:27.889
Ratner.

11:27.921 --> 11:28.891
Jack Ratner.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.120
Maria Moniz.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.126
That is the real reason

11:38.165 --> 11:41.225
I don't believe in long-term relationships.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.938
No more firsts.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.740
Like they get used up.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.383
I mean that was the first time we've ever touched hands.

11:48.408 --> 11:52.008
It'll never happen again that you know, that feeling.

11:53.480 --> 11:57.120
Once all the firsts are gone, hey what are you left with?

12:05.425 --> 12:07.925
I don't know what you just said.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.961
but I loved the way you said it.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.504
Mmmmm.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.238
What?

12:19.272 --> 12:20.772
You have to stop.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.538
Even being rejected in Portuguese is hot.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.018
Jack, I have to go.

12:28.048 --> 12:31.048
Unlike you I have to be at work early in the morning.

12:31.551 --> 12:32.891
Jack.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.220
Jack, off.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.158
Not until you're gone.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.529
It might be awkward with you in the room.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.828
You're so crude.

12:41.228 --> 12:45.398
Mmmm,

12:45.432 --> 12:46.472
Stay over tonight.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.239
Please.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.068
Why?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.113
"A" I live closer to your school.

12:52.139 --> 12:55.939
"B" I make killer waffles in the morning.

12:55.976 --> 12:59.876
And "C" I'll pay you a thousand dollars.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.283
"D" all of the above?

13:04.317 --> 13:07.517
Mmmmmmm.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.824
That was the best apple pie I've ever had.

13:10.858 --> 13:11.418
Really?

13:11.458 --> 13:12.488
Cause I wouldn't know.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.085
You kind of ate it all.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.097
I did not!

13:15.128 --> 13:17.358
I even left you the last piece.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.527
This here?

13:20.567 --> 13:23.537
Anyway, everything was planned.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.040
Children, moving to the suburbs.

13:26.073 --> 13:29.083
My dad was devastated when he found out we broke up.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.579
But the worst part was that we lived together.

13:31.611 --> 13:34.151
I'll never make that mistake again.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.351
I like my own place too much.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.353
What, you don't want a family?

13:38.385 --> 13:39.445
Children?

13:39.486 --> 13:41.116
Marriage is not for me.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.364
I can't picture myself behind the white picket fence

13:43.390 --> 13:45.360
playing catch with Jack junior.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.232
So you have no problems growing old and dying alone?

13:48.261 --> 13:49.861
Having the neighbors notify the police

13:49.897 --> 13:51.967
about the awful stench of your rotting corpse.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.969
Jesus Christ, when you put it that way.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.001
You shouldn't say that.

13:55.035 --> 13:55.965
Say, what?

13:56.003 --> 13:58.173
Use God's name like that.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.635
Oh, you're one of those.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.013
I noticed the cross.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.212
Just thought it might be for decoration.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.554
What do you mean, "one of those"?

14:06.579 --> 14:08.449
You don't believe in God?

14:08.481 --> 14:10.921
Umm, not so much.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.221
Though, after skimming the bible,

14:12.252 --> 14:14.052
I've gotta give Joe and Mary props

14:14.087 --> 14:16.417
for selling the whole immaculate conception thing.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.656
It's brilliant.

14:17.690 --> 14:21.930
Nowadays, compromising facebook photos would have sunk her.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.232
That isn't funny.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.467
So if you don't believe in God then who do you pray to?

14:27.500 --> 14:28.470
Tom Brady.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.911
But only if it's late in the fourth quarter.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.509
I don't believe you.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.510
Trust me, when something life changing happens,

14:36.543 --> 14:38.153
you'll be praying.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.608
Okay, no way, not me.

14:39.646 --> 14:43.576
I may be a lot of things, but I'm not a hypocrite.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.357
Hey.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.661
Morning.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.492
Do you want some fruit for breakfast?

14:54.527 --> 14:57.327
Do you have any idea how much sugar's in that stuff?

15:01.534 --> 15:04.244
You were snoring again last night.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.671
I don't snore.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.265
It's like sleeping with Darth Vader.

15:07.307 --> 15:10.077
I'll make a video clip and add it to your file.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.346
Hey.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.324
Hey, you okay?

15:18.351 --> 15:19.451
What's wrong?

15:19.652 --> 15:20.622
Nothing.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.719
It's stupid.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.026
Well lucky for you I specialize in stupidity

15:27.060 --> 15:29.130
and have a Ph. D. in nothing.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.662
So technically, I'm overqualified for this conversation.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.072
Well uhh,

15:38.338 --> 15:41.108
You know when you feel like you've reached a point

15:41.141 --> 15:42.981
where you're finally living out your life

15:43.010 --> 15:45.180
and not other peoples expectations?

15:46.579 --> 15:47.509
Well-

15:47.547 --> 15:49.677
Now that I'm not splitting the rent anymore,

15:49.716 --> 15:52.146
I can't afford my place so-

15:54.354 --> 15:56.964
I'm gonna have to move back in with my parents.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.333
Well umm, you know uhh,

16:07.400 --> 16:09.400
Maybe you could move in here you know,

16:09.436 --> 16:12.306
for a little while until you find another place.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.269
Jack, you'd be okay with that?

16:14.307 --> 16:15.277
Yeah, sure.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.608
I'm mean you're practically living here anyway.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.454
What's a week?

16:18.478 --> 16:20.678
Oh baby!

16:20.713 --> 16:21.783
Thank you!

16:21.814 --> 16:25.354
Oh baby I promise you won't even know that I'm here.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.215
Oh god.

16:26.253 --> 16:29.563
Thank you.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.589
Oh, that's great.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.737
Oh my god.

16:51.778 --> 16:52.748
You like?

16:53.813 --> 16:56.153
I feel like I just got violated by Pottery Barn.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.523
Oh, you hate it?

16:57.550 --> 16:58.650
No, no.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.385
It's just different that's all.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.661
Kinda looks like your place did.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.490
Yeah, I just brought a few of my furniture pieces in.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.786
I hope you don't mind?

17:08.261 --> 17:09.031
Wow.

17:09.061 --> 17:11.301
That's uhh, that's a big cross.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.528
It'll protect us from the evil eye.

17:14.701 --> 17:15.501
Ohh.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.436
I didn't know Mr. Bojangles would be joining us.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.412
Awe, where did you think he'd be staying, silly?

17:22.442 --> 17:26.852
Eh, eh, good boy, good boy.

17:30.683 --> 17:31.753
Eh.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.342
Awwww! Shit!

18:27.374 --> 18:29.314
I think you broke it!

18:29.342 --> 18:32.882
I'm so sorry.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.148
Maria?

19:16.689 --> 19:18.289
Jesus christ!

19:18.325 --> 19:19.555
Shhh.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.374
I am a rational person.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.502
Rational, huh?

19:30.537 --> 19:32.707
Is that why I saw you throwing salt over your shoulder?

19:32.739 --> 19:34.909
Don't tell me you're one of those superstitious freaks?

19:34.941 --> 19:36.811
it's not a superstition if it works.

19:36.843 --> 19:37.843
Ah-ha.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.577
The truth finally comes out.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.652
You're crazy.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.880
Don't call me crazy.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.845
Senhora Maria says it's better safe than sorry.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.515
Who's Senhora Maria?

19:48.555 --> 19:51.585
Just someone who advises me.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.764
Like a-Like a therapist?

19:53.793 --> 19:56.263
Yeah, like a therapist.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.659
Hey, babe, how was your-

20:30.697 --> 20:34.697
Quick, get me a lighter!

20:37.404 --> 20:39.474
What is it?

20:39.506 --> 20:41.466
I think some woman at the grocery store

20:41.508 --> 20:43.408
gave me the evil eye.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.583
Huh?

20:45.077 --> 20:46.547
Here we go.

20:46.779 --> 20:47.649
What is that?

20:48.448 --> 20:50.448
Sage.

20:55.622 --> 20:56.622
Oh no.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.556
I might have already infected the entire place.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.462
Wait, what the hell's evil eye?

21:02.495 --> 21:05.765
It's when someone curses you and gives you really bad luck.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.498
Sometimes people do it

21:07.534 --> 21:09.644
and they don't even realize they're doing it.

21:11.070 --> 21:14.510
Come on Maria, don't tell me you really believe in that?

21:20.447 --> 21:21.647
Apparently so.

21:21.881 --> 21:22.921
That should work.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.049
Don't worry, I'll see Senhora Maria

21:24.083 --> 21:26.053
and make sure that we're in the clear.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.585
Maria, this is insane.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.390
Nobody can just give you bad luck.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.462
That's just a Portuguese old wives tale.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.661
The evil eye does not exist!

21:33.693 --> 21:36.533
Do you have any idea how foolish you sound right now?

21:47.940 --> 21:52.650
Jack, this is your father.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.749
He's actually on oxygen, it's kinda sad.

21:54.781 --> 21:55.681
Oww.

21:55.715 --> 21:56.915
No he's not.

21:59.018 --> 22:02.958
Your sitcom writing is weak and career dubious.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.759
Come work for me at Ratner Investments

22:05.792 --> 22:06.962
and together we shall-

22:09.962 --> 22:11.832
- make something of you.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.365
That's your dad's idea of success, not yours.

22:15.402 --> 22:15.972
Mhmmm.

22:16.703 --> 22:19.513
You are wise Portuguese one.

22:20.707 --> 22:23.377
So what about the rest of your family?

22:23.410 --> 22:24.010
Brothers?

22:24.043 --> 22:25.653
Sisters?

22:25.678 --> 22:27.408
None.

22:27.447 --> 22:28.677
Cousins?

22:28.715 --> 22:29.375
Grandparents?

22:29.416 --> 22:29.776
Aunts?

22:29.816 --> 22:31.376
Uncles?

22:31.418 --> 22:34.488
One Uncle, but I'm pretty sure he's in prison.

22:34.521 --> 22:37.691
Oh, Jack that's-

22:38.057 --> 22:39.587
wonderful.

22:39.626 --> 22:41.956
Having a small family.

22:41.994 --> 22:44.434
Mine can be overwhelming.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.604
I'd much rather have a big colorful family

22:46.633 --> 22:48.033
than a bland one any day.

23:00.647 --> 23:01.077
Okay.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.390
Relax.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.085
Ok.

23:12.091 --> 23:14.661
Oh, no, we don't use the front door!

23:14.694 --> 23:15.804
We use the back door.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.058
Okay.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.026
Now, don't be nervous, Jack.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.095
I'm not.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.702
I just want you to know,

23:21.734 --> 23:23.474
how important first impressions are.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.043
Hey, don't worry, parents love me.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.911
I'm like cat nip for old people.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.909
Oh and please don't try and be funny.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.981
And don't tell my parents that you're divorced,

23:31.010 --> 23:34.680
or that you're an atheist or that you're in between jobs.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.084
Okay?

23:36.115 --> 23:37.345
Anything else?

23:37.383 --> 23:42.123
Oh, and your grandfather on your mom's side was part Portuguese.

23:42.154 --> 23:43.124
Ok?

23:44.857 --> 23:47.527
Hey!

23:47.560 --> 23:48.930
There's my beautiful daughter.

23:48.961 --> 23:52.131
Querida, two Sundays I don't see you.

23:52.164 --> 23:55.574
Where have you been hiding, my little badger?

23:55.935 --> 24:00.065
Mom, Dad, this is Jack my boyfriend.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.215
He's pleased to meet you.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.185
Lets go.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.574
This looks delicious.

24:28.668 --> 24:29.568
What is it?

24:29.969 --> 24:30.899
Cozido.

24:39.746 --> 24:40.846
Pigs feet.

24:46.586 --> 24:47.546
Thanks.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.560
I can't believe you ate that, dude.

24:55.595 --> 24:56.655
There's pizza.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.576
Thank you.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.125
Have some rice pudding.

26:00.727 --> 26:01.787
I will.

26:04.964 --> 26:05.734
Ow!

26:10.036 --> 26:10.996
Where's Mr. Moniz?

26:12.271 --> 26:14.341
Ah, he's probably in the house.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.383
Go talk to him, Jack.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.748
He gets nervous with new people.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.749
I can tell by the way she looks at you,

26:22.782 --> 26:25.022
you have won my daughter over.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.134
Thanks, mom.

27:07.126 --> 27:10.226
I bet you don't get too many vampires down here, huh?

27:10.262 --> 27:11.932
Because of the uhh-

27:15.735 --> 27:17.795
So, I hear your a big football fan?

27:17.837 --> 27:19.307
So am I.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.268
Who's your team?

27:20.306 --> 27:22.336
Stay away from Maria.

27:22.374 --> 27:24.784
Can't say I'm familiar with them.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.981
Although I imagine their logo is just a picture

27:27.013 --> 27:28.253
of you looking angry.

27:30.717 --> 27:31.877
Kind of like that.

27:31.918 --> 27:32.988
You make jokes.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.189
Jokes aren't funny!

27:34.486 --> 27:36.686
Jokes won't make my daughter happy!

27:36.723 --> 27:41.163
With all do respect, sir, I do make your daughter happy.

27:41.193 --> 27:43.363
I mean, I think I do.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.795
And I know I want to, more than anything.

27:45.832 --> 27:47.202
Have you ever heard the expression,

27:47.233 --> 27:49.073
"laughter is the best medicine"?

27:49.836 --> 27:52.166
Have you heard the Portuguese expression,

27:52.204 --> 27:55.914
"medicine is the best medicine"?

27:55.942 --> 27:58.082
You know who said that?

27:58.110 --> 28:01.480
Maria's ex fiancé.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.853
He's a doctor!

28:17.930 --> 28:21.300
Uhh, my uncle says, you're a lucky man.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.100
Thank you, Uncle Joao.

28:29.108 --> 28:29.838
Two.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.287
You did that on purpose, didn't you you little devil?

28:42.989 --> 28:44.089
I gotta go.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.832
Goodnight everyone, thank you.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.000
Bye!

28:50.229 --> 28:51.199
Love you!

28:51.230 --> 28:52.430
Love you too.

28:59.305 --> 29:00.505
They hate me.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.537
They don't hate you.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.884
They just need to get to know you.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.281
Well I'm not sure how crazy I am about them.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.553
They're judgmental, intimidating.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.251
Your father threatened me, and your sister!

29:12.284 --> 29:15.294
Mmm, I have never seen dexterity in toes like that!

29:15.321 --> 29:16.021
Ever!

29:17.156 --> 29:18.486
Your grandmother caught me on the lips.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.264
It was like kissing a catfish!

29:23.029 --> 29:26.029
And the Ricky Martin painting?!

29:26.065 --> 29:26.725
The what?

29:26.765 --> 29:30.065
In your dads little man cave?

29:30.102 --> 29:33.542
Oh, no, that's not Ricky Martin, that's Cristiano Ronaldo,

29:33.572 --> 29:35.942
a famous Portuguese soccer player.

29:36.375 --> 29:39.305
Listen Jack, I know they can be a handful.

29:39.345 --> 29:42.575
But I'm just really glad you tried.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.384
It meant a lot to me.

29:46.218 --> 29:46.988
Wow.

29:47.987 --> 29:50.857
I've never seen you get worked up like this.

29:50.890 --> 29:54.460
What happened to cool cat nip Jack?

29:54.493 --> 29:57.163
He just got a taste of his future in-laws.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.534
What?

30:02.234 --> 30:05.874
I was planning on doing this differently.

30:08.540 --> 30:13.380
Maria, you've made me realize all the things

30:13.412 --> 30:16.582
I never knew I wanted.

30:16.615 --> 30:21.585
And now that I know, there's only one thing left to do.

30:23.489 --> 30:24.319
Will you marry-

30:24.356 --> 30:25.416
Oh yes!

30:25.457 --> 30:29.527
Yes, yes, yes!

30:30.329 --> 30:32.499
We just have to see Senhora Maria first.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.396
Your therapist?

30:37.069 --> 30:38.539
I believe in therapy.

30:38.570 --> 30:41.940
I think people can learn a lot about themselves, you know.

30:41.974 --> 30:44.284
I guess, it's just not for me.

30:44.310 --> 30:46.450
You know travelling is my therapy.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.408
I learned a lot about myself

30:48.447 --> 30:50.317
while backpackingthrough Europe.

30:50.349 --> 30:54.319
But it was my time in India was the most profound.

30:54.353 --> 30:57.923
I remember riding an elephant to see the Taj Mahal at sunset.

30:57.957 --> 31:00.157
It was the most incredible thing.

31:00.192 --> 31:03.262
Emperor Shah Jahan built it in memory of his deceased wife.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.095
They say it's the world's most magnificent

31:05.131 --> 31:07.431
monument dedicated to love and devotion.

31:10.169 --> 31:12.909
What does it look like?

31:12.939 --> 31:16.179
Oh, words can't even describe it.

31:16.208 --> 31:19.108
It's just, so incredible.

31:19.145 --> 31:21.405
Mmm, I am so jealous.

31:21.447 --> 31:23.377
Here you are, this world traveller

31:23.415 --> 31:26.345
and I've hardly been anywhere.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.085
I figure we've only got this one world,

31:29.121 --> 31:32.161
we should try and experience it.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.456
Oh, you're alive!

31:35.494 --> 31:36.104
I am.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.028
Thank God.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.973
See I assumed you were dead because why else

31:38.998 --> 31:41.968
when we have a network pitch coming up would you go AWOL

31:42.001 --> 31:44.941
and stop answering your email and your phone and your text.

31:44.971 --> 31:47.041
Uhh.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.183
Um, holy shit!

31:49.208 --> 31:51.008
Looks like Martha Stewart vomited in here.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.213
What's going on?

31:52.244 --> 31:54.714
I uhh, I got a roommate.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.476
You're living with someone?

31:56.515 --> 31:59.445
Yeah, my fiancé.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.445
Get the f-

32:01.487 --> 32:02.487
Are you serious?

32:02.521 --> 32:03.191
Yeah.

32:03.222 --> 32:04.322
You're serious!?

32:04.356 --> 32:06.126
Oh my god no, no, no.

32:06.158 --> 32:09.128
This is the worst thing that could happen to a writing team!

32:09.161 --> 32:10.301
Wilson, come on,

32:10.329 --> 32:12.529
Oh and you already got that stupid look on your face.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.134
No wonder your ideas lick!

32:14.166 --> 32:15.496
You've got love brain!

32:15.534 --> 32:19.044
Hey, I don't have love brain and my ideas don't lick!

32:19.071 --> 32:23.041
What about my script "Special Agent Ed"?

32:23.075 --> 32:25.435
That's about a retarded FBI agent!

32:28.280 --> 32:29.980
Oh my god.

32:30.016 --> 32:31.246
I do have love brain.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.323
Ditch this chick.

32:32.351 --> 32:34.091
Cause we've got three network pitches coming up,

32:34.120 --> 32:35.320
and we have Jack!

32:35.354 --> 32:37.124
That's funny, I should write that down.

32:37.156 --> 32:38.716
I promise I won't let my relationship

32:38.757 --> 32:40.087
affect our work anymore.

32:40.126 --> 32:42.126
I need this more than you do man.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.401
Mhmm, that's debatable.

32:43.429 --> 32:48.469
But Wilson, you have to meet Maria.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.240
Maria?

32:49.268 --> 32:50.638
Her names Maria, she's ethnic?!

32:50.669 --> 32:51.999
Great!

32:52.038 --> 32:53.508
That's like lovebrain on crack!

32:56.142 --> 33:00.352
Don't worry Senora Maria is very nice, you'll love her.

33:00.379 --> 33:01.649
I'm not worried.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.150
Good.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.623
Ah, Nelia, how are you?

33:07.653 --> 33:12.123
I thought you died.

33:12.158 --> 33:16.328
Evil eye thing, I got one of these guys again, evil eye.

33:19.631 --> 33:22.701
Oh, Nelia, this is Jack, my fiancé.

33:22.734 --> 33:25.404
Jack this is my favorite cousin, Nelia.

33:25.437 --> 33:26.707
He so cute.

33:27.173 --> 33:28.373
Oh my god.

33:28.407 --> 33:29.607
What does Senhora Maria think?

33:29.641 --> 33:31.281
That's why we're here.

33:31.310 --> 33:32.240
First time?

33:32.278 --> 33:33.108
Yeah.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.124
Good to see you!

33:39.385 --> 33:40.285
Call me!

33:40.319 --> 33:41.689
I know, I know!

33:42.688 --> 33:43.388
Bye!

33:43.422 --> 33:45.292
Bye.

33:52.098 --> 33:53.428
This is your therapist's office?

33:53.465 --> 33:54.825
Shhhhh!

34:15.387 --> 34:17.157
You've got to be kidding me.

34:17.723 --> 34:18.663
Stop it.

34:18.690 --> 34:19.489
What?

34:31.870 --> 34:34.210
This is not the man for you.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.739
You must leave immediately.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.649
What is it, what did she say?

34:54.760 --> 35:00.870
So, how are the Patriots lookin' on Sunday, huh?

35:00.899 --> 35:04.799
Three turnovers. Pats lose by six.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.382
Why don't you just tell me what crystal ball lady said?

35:16.415 --> 35:17.515
It's obviously upsetting you.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.879
It's nothing.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.721
Are those the same underwear you had on last night?

35:24.756 --> 35:26.256
No.

35:26.292 --> 35:27.232
Ugh.

35:27.259 --> 35:28.429
Two days in a row.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.260
That's disgusting.

35:30.296 --> 35:31.656
I showered before bed last night.

35:31.697 --> 35:34.327
Why should I change them after only sleeping in them?

35:34.366 --> 35:35.526
Because that's the rule.

35:35.567 --> 35:36.697
Everyone knows everyday

35:36.735 --> 35:38.695
starts off with a fresh pair of underwear.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.937
Well, there's 24-hours in a day, so technically-

35:40.972 --> 35:42.272
I'm still good.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.278
I better not catch you

35:43.309 --> 35:45.479
trying to squeeze another day out of those.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.311
Yes, mom.

35:47.346 --> 35:49.216
Look, you're letting whatever that voodoo lady

35:49.248 --> 35:51.578
said get to you, and that's completely nuts.

35:51.617 --> 35:53.287
Senhora Maria has a gift.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.149
Yeah, and it's called hustling!

35:57.556 --> 35:58.216
Wait.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.587
Aren't you going to fold my underwear?!

36:00.626 --> 36:01.256
Hm?

36:02.394 --> 36:03.764
You're stacking, see how I fold yours.

36:03.795 --> 36:06.525
That's how you do it!

36:06.565 --> 36:10.335
Do you really expect me to fold this?

36:10.602 --> 36:12.672
Yes!

36:12.704 --> 36:14.274
It's like trying to do origami.

36:14.306 --> 36:16.876
Now please tell me that this has something to do with

36:16.908 --> 36:19.448
voodoo lady, because this is the most intense conversation

36:19.478 --> 36:22.278
about underwear, anyone has ever had!

36:22.314 --> 36:24.824
She said we have to hold off on getting married.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.290
It's not a big deal.

36:26.318 --> 36:29.758
It just means she has to read you or us again.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.558
This is about your family, isn't it?

36:31.590 --> 36:33.590
It has nothing to do with Senhora Maria.

36:33.625 --> 36:34.985
She's just a excuse.

36:35.026 --> 36:35.886
No, Jack.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.372
Maria, I promise I will change your father's mind about me -

36:39.398 --> 36:40.628
because he's your family.

36:40.666 --> 36:43.766
But there is no way in hell I'm going to see the fortune teller.

36:43.802 --> 36:46.572
Now if you believe in her, that's fine, that's your thing.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.965
But I will never be told by some "magic lady"

36:49.007 --> 36:51.537
who I can and can't marry.

36:51.577 --> 36:52.637
And neither should you.

36:54.613 --> 37:00.793
Look Maria, I love you.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.519
That's all you need to know.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.820
I love you too, Jack.

37:08.627 --> 37:12.327
Our first fight.

37:12.364 --> 37:15.374
You know what this can mean?

37:15.401 --> 37:16.501
What?

37:16.535 --> 37:18.395
Our first make-up sex.

37:18.437 --> 37:19.607
Ohh.

37:19.638 --> 37:21.668
God I love firsts.

37:22.408 --> 37:24.008
Not on the underwear!

37:30.682 --> 37:33.592
Good morning, baby.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.994
Time to tell my parents the good news.

37:44.696 --> 37:47.296
Have you seen any of my hair ties around?

37:48.334 --> 37:49.604
I love this game.

37:50.936 --> 37:53.406
I found one in my cereal the other day.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.375
Come on we have to go.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.009
Ready?

38:02.047 --> 38:02.907
Bring it on.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.578
No pausing.

38:04.616 --> 38:05.416
Go!

38:05.451 --> 38:06.751
Favorite musician?

38:06.785 --> 38:08.415
- Black-eyed peas.
- Katy Perry.

38:08.454 --> 38:09.464
Favorite movie?

38:09.488 --> 38:10.588
- Star Wars.
- The Notebook.

38:10.622 --> 38:11.762
Favorite food?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.490
- French fries.
- Chinese.

38:13.525 --> 38:14.785
Uhh, favorite position?

38:14.826 --> 38:17.056
- Quarterback.
- On top.

38:17.095 --> 38:18.055
Wow!

38:18.096 --> 38:19.256
You were right.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.697
This is definitely the best way to get to know someone.

38:21.733 --> 38:22.333
No, no.

38:22.368 --> 38:23.398
I thought you meant-

38:23.435 --> 38:24.065
I said position.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.502
And look where you went.

38:25.537 --> 38:26.537
You set me up!

38:26.572 --> 38:28.372
You totally set me up!

38:28.407 --> 38:29.507
It was your game.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.341
Wait a minute, why am I embarrassed?

38:31.377 --> 38:33.347
You just admitted to liking Katy Perry.

38:33.379 --> 38:34.579
What's wrong with Katy Perry?

38:34.613 --> 38:36.353
Nothing, if you're a tween.

38:43.622 --> 38:46.122
On top, huh?

38:46.157 --> 38:47.887
You better believe it.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.426
How come we always enter through the back door?

38:53.465 --> 38:57.835
Because we never use the front entrance of our house.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.099
Why not?

38:59.137 --> 39:01.967
Because then it would get dirty.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.107
C'mon.

39:04.610 --> 39:05.710
I got this.

39:13.151 --> 39:14.391
Marco!

39:14.420 --> 39:15.590
Dinner!

39:19.157 --> 39:20.885
Hey.

39:30.602 --> 39:33.102
You're most susceptible to the devil when you yawn.

39:33.138 --> 39:34.368
Mom stopped him.

39:35.441 --> 39:36.111
Right on.

39:43.915 --> 39:46.885
Homemade Portuguese wine is the best wine in the world.

39:50.055 --> 39:52.755
Jose, you missed someone.

39:52.791 --> 39:53.691
That's okay.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.685
I'm not a big drinker.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.197
You no like Portuguese wine?!

39:57.228 --> 39:57.898
No, no.

39:57.929 --> 39:58.729
I do.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.504
I just wanted you to know that I,

40:00.532 --> 40:04.102
that I don't have a drinking problem or anything.

40:04.135 --> 40:07.935
So, Jack, Maria tells us that you write funny tv.

40:07.973 --> 40:10.183
But what do you do for a living?

40:10.208 --> 40:11.608
Uhh well, that's it.

40:11.643 --> 40:12.983
I'm a-I'm a writer.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.981
I write sitcoms for a living.

40:15.013 --> 40:16.953
Jack created the show "My Two Dicks"?

40:16.982 --> 40:18.122
Sweet!

40:18.149 --> 40:19.019
Detectives.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.620
My Two Detectives.

40:20.652 --> 40:22.492
Writing is not a job.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.861
Have you thought about construction?

40:23.889 --> 40:26.189
You need a real job to support a family.

40:26.224 --> 40:28.034
Jose, what did we talk about?

40:28.059 --> 40:28.859
I'm being nice.

40:28.894 --> 40:29.934
Right, Jack?

40:29.961 --> 40:32.901
Why don't you tell us what you know about Portugal.

40:32.931 --> 40:33.731
Dad?

40:33.765 --> 40:36.665
Let him answer, badger.

40:36.702 --> 40:37.842
Well I umm-

40:37.869 --> 40:39.039
This should be good.

40:41.707 --> 40:44.137
I didn't realize this would be on the test.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.810
To be honest, I don't know too much, sir.

40:47.846 --> 40:52.016
All I know is that Portugal's a very small country-

40:52.050 --> 40:53.820
so they must have very small people

40:53.852 --> 40:55.622
so they can all fit in it.

40:59.858 --> 41:02.658
Not that you're small sir.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.064
You are a good size.

41:08.534 --> 41:10.104
But one thing is for certain.

41:10.135 --> 41:13.765
Portugal's number one export must be beautiful women.

41:13.805 --> 41:19.205
Maria, Avo-

41:19.244 --> 41:21.484
Uhh, Mrs. Moniz.

41:22.213 --> 41:23.983
Mr. Moniz, you are a lucky man!

41:24.015 --> 41:25.845
Lucky that I'm not ten years older.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.854
That's some uh, good Portuguese genes right there

41:27.886 --> 41:30.186
and I'd love to get in on that action.

41:32.223 --> 41:37.103
I mean, have beautiful Portuguese children one day,

41:37.128 --> 41:41.198
with your daughter, not your wife.

41:41.232 --> 41:43.172
That would be wildly inappropriate.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.641
Is this another one of your jokes, Jack?

41:45.671 --> 41:46.841
Jesus Christ, no.

41:46.872 --> 41:47.842
Jack.

41:47.873 --> 41:48.673
Oh, goddamnit.

41:48.707 --> 41:50.837
Jack!

41:50.876 --> 41:53.136
Did you know that five hundred years ago

41:53.178 --> 41:55.878
Portugal conquered eighty percent of the globe?!

41:55.914 --> 42:00.554
Now how could such a small country have so much power?

42:03.354 --> 42:05.194
Because they are strong and smart?

42:05.223 --> 42:07.063
That's right!

42:07.092 --> 42:10.862
Hey Marco, take Jack to your room and show him the old map!

42:10.896 --> 42:12.196
Right now before dinner.

42:12.230 --> 42:13.200
Do I have to?

42:13.231 --> 42:16.231
If you're not out of here in five seconds-

42:26.144 --> 42:26.754
Dad.

42:26.778 --> 42:28.108
How could you give up

42:28.146 --> 42:30.276
such a nice Portuguese doctor for this?

42:30.315 --> 42:31.615
Jose, please.

42:31.650 --> 42:32.750
I will not please Anna!

42:32.784 --> 42:35.994
Someone in this family has to talk some sense to her!

42:36.021 --> 42:38.091
Maria.

42:40.325 --> 42:42.755
You two don't belong together.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.234
You're too different.

42:44.262 --> 42:45.062
Can't you see?

42:45.096 --> 42:48.226
I mean, he will never understand us.

42:48.934 --> 42:50.304
Daddy, I love him.

42:52.270 --> 42:55.270
You only think you do, I can find you a better match.

42:55.306 --> 42:58.376
Trust me.

43:12.991 --> 43:13.831
How could you?!

43:13.859 --> 43:15.629
The silence must have been killing you!

43:15.661 --> 43:17.631
You get asked a simple question about Portugal,

43:17.663 --> 43:19.633
and you answer it by insulting my dad

43:19.665 --> 43:21.025
and then hitting on my mom?!

43:21.066 --> 43:23.366
You know your dad makes me very nervous.

43:23.401 --> 43:24.141
And your mom-

43:24.169 --> 43:26.039
well it was meant as a compliment.

43:26.071 --> 43:28.011
It was creepy!

43:28.039 --> 43:29.809
Why didn't you just talk about backpacking

43:29.841 --> 43:31.081
through Europe, Jack?

43:33.779 --> 43:36.309
Wait, you have been to Europe, right?

43:37.883 --> 43:39.383
I'm so sorry.

43:39.417 --> 43:41.187
Oh my god, you lied to me?!

43:41.219 --> 43:42.819
I was trying to impress you!

43:42.854 --> 43:44.224
I got caught up.

43:44.255 --> 43:46.255
"We've only have this one world,

43:46.291 --> 43:47.961
we should try and experience it"?!

43:47.993 --> 43:50.033
Have you even been to India?!

43:50.061 --> 43:51.931
Indiana?

43:51.963 --> 43:52.963
I'm so sorry.

43:52.998 --> 43:56.898
I swear it's the only thing I've ever fibbed about

43:56.935 --> 44:00.035
and I am so sorry Maria.

44:00.071 --> 44:03.411
For lying and embarrassing you.

44:03.441 --> 44:05.411
I'm gonna make this up to you, Maria.

44:05.443 --> 44:07.783
I promise.

44:07.813 --> 44:10.223
I'm gonna show your family the real Jack.

44:10.248 --> 44:12.678
Please don't.

44:33.338 --> 44:38.978
Space Bar, it's like "Cheers" in space?

44:45.450 --> 44:46.450
Do you hate me?

44:46.484 --> 44:48.024
It was just an idea.

44:48.053 --> 44:49.093
I've got others.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.120
I've read the others!

44:50.155 --> 44:50.985
We're screwed, Jack.

44:51.022 --> 44:53.122
Our pitch is at the end of the month

44:53.158 --> 44:57.458
and your only solution is to reboot 80's sitcoms in space!

44:57.495 --> 44:59.395
I mean, you're the concept guy.

44:59.430 --> 45:01.700
The hell you been doing with your time?

45:10.375 --> 45:13.745
I've been hashing out some new concepts.

45:13.779 --> 45:15.809
Right.

45:15.847 --> 45:18.777
It's been a little rocky on the home front lately.

45:18.817 --> 45:20.847
How long have we been friends?

45:20.886 --> 45:21.086
Forever.

45:21.119 --> 45:22.289
Mhm.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.260
You know I'd push someone so they'd take a bullet for you,

45:24.289 --> 45:25.319
right?

45:25.356 --> 45:26.086
Yeah.

45:26.124 --> 45:28.234
Right so, prioritize us, Jack.

45:28.259 --> 45:29.959
We are running out of time.

45:29.995 --> 45:31.495
Tick, tick, tick.

45:31.529 --> 45:33.229
Look Maria's a really great person,

45:33.264 --> 45:36.074
but dude, it's not your first rodeo.

45:36.101 --> 45:37.041
Engagement?

45:37.068 --> 45:37.838
Tomato.

45:37.869 --> 45:38.739
The point is, girls come and go,

45:38.770 --> 45:41.240
but I have always been there for you.

45:41.272 --> 45:47.052
So stop being a bitch and give me a decent pitch.

45:47.078 --> 45:48.208
Hey, Wilson.

45:48.880 --> 45:50.120
How's the writing going?

45:50.148 --> 45:50.878
Peachy.

45:50.916 --> 45:53.476
Hey babe, where are you going?

45:53.518 --> 45:56.858
Uhh, just gonna get some fresh cod fish for dinner.

45:56.888 --> 45:57.788
See ya later.

45:57.823 --> 45:59.463
Yeah, see ya later.

46:02.460 --> 46:04.260
Stupid love brain.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.140
Jack!

46:14.039 --> 46:14.769
Jack!

46:15.773 --> 46:17.043
You said you cleaned the bottom of the cupboards.

46:17.075 --> 46:18.135
I did.

46:18.176 --> 46:19.876
Well then you don't know the difference between clean

46:19.911 --> 46:21.181
and Portuguese clean.

46:21.212 --> 46:23.482
My Avó will white glove us, Jack.

46:25.283 --> 46:27.493
Did you dust the tops of the kitchen cupboards?

46:27.518 --> 46:30.058
She could never reach.

46:30.088 --> 46:31.918
Never under estimate an old Portuguese woman

46:31.957 --> 46:33.087
looking for dirt.

46:35.026 --> 46:36.186
Fine!

46:38.529 --> 46:40.069
Did you clean the bathroom?!

46:40.899 --> 46:42.829
Yes!

46:42.868 --> 46:44.868
And did you take out the bathroom garbage?!

46:45.070 --> 46:46.000
Yes!

46:46.037 --> 46:47.967
Do we always have to shout at each other?!

46:48.006 --> 46:49.206
What?!

46:49.240 --> 46:50.210
Never mind.

46:50.241 --> 46:51.281
What?!

46:51.309 --> 46:53.209
I said, never mind!

46:56.047 --> 46:59.447
I'm turning into one of them.

47:08.326 --> 47:10.456
Jack, I didn't know you spoke Portuguese?

47:10.495 --> 47:11.955
He's been learning.

47:12.330 --> 47:15.070
We know his English wasn't working.

47:15.100 --> 47:16.630
Well, I'm very impressed, Jack.

47:16.667 --> 47:19.037
Did you know that it was a Portuguese priest

47:19.070 --> 47:21.010
who pioneered solar panels?

47:21.039 --> 47:22.609
And that it was a Portuguese doctor

47:22.640 --> 47:24.210
who invented the lobotomy?

47:24.242 --> 47:25.212
Why?

47:25.243 --> 47:26.643
You in the market?

47:28.246 --> 47:30.176
I can be funny too right?

47:30.215 --> 47:31.075
Jose.

47:34.085 --> 47:36.985
Ah, I wish Sporting was playing that's my team.

47:37.188 --> 47:38.418
You like Sporting?

47:38.456 --> 47:42.156
Yeah, I'd like them a lot better if they had Cristiano Ronaldo!

47:42.193 --> 47:44.033
Ronaldinhu!

47:44.529 --> 47:47.329
Maybe this guy's not so bad, Maria.

47:47.365 --> 47:49.325
Ronaldo!

47:53.538 --> 47:54.568
It's going good!

48:08.253 --> 48:10.363
Jack, what's in his mouth?

48:10.388 --> 48:11.958
He's got a condom.

48:11.990 --> 48:13.190
Oh my god.

48:14.192 --> 48:16.632
Hey, nobody wants this.

48:20.465 --> 48:21.525
Mom, coffee?

48:21.566 --> 48:23.996
Dad, some more wine?

48:24.035 --> 48:25.435
Oh yeah, sorry!

48:26.237 --> 48:27.207
Give it to me.

48:27.238 --> 48:28.638
Give it to me,

48:28.673 --> 48:30.043
Mom, dad?

48:33.278 --> 48:35.305
Good doggy.

48:38.683 --> 48:39.993
You want a cookie?

48:40.585 --> 48:42.345
Yeah, you want a cookie?

48:44.122 --> 48:45.492
Maria get him a cookie!

48:47.358 --> 48:49.188
Here, Mr. Bojangles.

48:49.227 --> 48:50.257
Come, come.

48:50.295 --> 48:52.325
Mamas got a biscuit.

48:52.363 --> 48:55.403
It's peanut butter, your favorite.

49:07.112 --> 49:09.152
I thought Mr. Bojangles was fixed.

49:12.017 --> 49:14.187
Bojangles totally threw me under the bus.

49:14.219 --> 49:15.589
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

49:15.620 --> 49:17.360
Do not blame Mr. Bojangles!

49:17.388 --> 49:20.188
I specifically asked you if you threw out the bathroom garbage.

49:20.225 --> 49:21.555
And you said "Yes"!

49:21.592 --> 49:22.592
I thought I had.

49:22.627 --> 49:23.557
I'm sorry.

49:29.467 --> 49:30.467
Maria?

49:30.501 --> 49:31.541
Go to sleep.

49:31.569 --> 49:34.109
What, you don't even know what I was going to ask.

49:34.139 --> 49:39.179
The answer's "no" to all of your questions.

49:39.210 --> 49:43.580
I just you know I just think it's been a while since-

49:43.614 --> 49:46.154
Since what?

49:46.184 --> 49:49.024
Since I got to visit Area 51.

49:49.054 --> 49:51.494
I've heard rumors about it.

49:52.357 --> 49:53.257
Ow!

49:54.459 --> 49:56.589
You don't have to practice being in a bad mood, you know.

49:56.627 --> 50:02.597
'Cause you're like a professional!

50:09.174 --> 50:10.184
Jack?

50:12.543 --> 50:13.683
Jack?

50:17.315 --> 50:19.145
Jack, did you take out the garbage?

50:19.184 --> 50:20.554
Maria, I'm working!

51:02.527 --> 51:04.427
Let go, Maria.

51:04.462 --> 51:06.102
It was never meant to be.

51:06.597 --> 51:09.197
Well if Senhora Maria says it, it must be true!

51:09.234 --> 51:11.404
For once in your life, can you be serious?

51:11.436 --> 51:14.166
Can you not make your stupid little jokes?!

51:15.806 --> 51:17.436
Only if you can speak English.

51:17.475 --> 51:19.735
Blah, pish, blah, pish, That's all I ever hear.

51:19.777 --> 51:21.377
It's like listening to the dishwasher!

51:21.412 --> 51:22.852
Excuse me for being bilingual!

51:22.880 --> 51:25.220
Excuse me for having a sense of humor!

51:25.250 --> 51:27.890
Senhora Maria said this would happen.

51:27.918 --> 51:29.248
I can't take this!

51:29.287 --> 51:31.657
You are crazy!

51:34.392 --> 51:35.562
Jesus Christ!

51:35.593 --> 51:36.863
What did you call me?!

51:36.894 --> 51:38.164
You heard me!

51:38.196 --> 51:39.896
I am not crazy!

51:39.930 --> 51:42.500
Then tell me why you believe in her so much?!

51:42.533 --> 51:46.703
Make me understand why you need Senhora Maria in your life?!

51:47.305 --> 51:49.765
Because she's never wrong!

51:56.647 --> 51:58.247
She told me to stay home.

51:58.283 --> 51:59.683
the day of Marco's accident.

51:59.717 --> 52:01.717
She warned me that something bad would happen,

52:01.752 --> 52:03.522
and I didn't listen.

52:05.490 --> 52:08.860
I was the one driving the car that day.

52:10.495 --> 52:13.255
I was supposed to drop Marco off at his soccer game,

52:13.298 --> 52:16.398
but I wanted a stupid pair of shoes from the mall first.

52:17.335 --> 52:21.205
And when I was going through an intersection when we got hit.

52:21.239 --> 52:23.169
I should have listened.

52:23.208 --> 52:23.868
Baby.

52:23.908 --> 52:25.778
No Jack, no.

52:27.445 --> 52:29.445
It was a freak accident.

52:29.714 --> 52:31.384
You can't blame yourself.

52:31.416 --> 52:33.276
It's not just that, it's everything.

52:33.918 --> 52:36.448
Don't you see, Jack?

52:36.487 --> 52:37.917
She's never wrong.

52:38.623 --> 52:40.493
Well, she's wrong about us.

52:41.826 --> 52:43.486
No, she's not.

52:44.529 --> 52:46.329
Look what's happening to us.

52:46.897 --> 52:50.367
We're just too different and deep down we both know it.

52:52.903 --> 52:54.313
I'm sorry.

53:02.847 --> 53:06.217
Is Senhora Maria the reason you broke up with your ex?

53:08.919 --> 53:11.289
Maria, okay, look at me.

53:12.290 --> 53:13.520
Is she the reason?

53:17.662 --> 53:19.332
Wow.

53:19.997 --> 53:24.297
Here I thought that my love for you actually mattered.

53:24.335 --> 53:27.965
That I was the guy whose love trumped superstition.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.580
But now I know I'm not that guy.

53:32.510 --> 53:33.710
Jack.

53:34.679 --> 53:37.479
I was just one of the guys who tried.

53:39.784 --> 53:41.494
Jack.

54:03.007 --> 54:07.447
Oh, querida.

54:10.515 --> 54:11.915
I'm so sorry.

54:15.019 --> 54:16.919
It's going to be alright.

54:27.998 --> 54:29.928
There was this one Christmas.

54:31.068 --> 54:31.998
I was nine.

54:33.270 --> 54:36.610
And I remember really wanting Starscream, this transformer.

54:36.641 --> 54:38.441
But not just any transformer,

54:38.476 --> 54:41.046
the coolest one because he could change into a fighter jet.

54:41.078 --> 54:42.008
Ooooh.

54:42.046 --> 54:43.906
Yeah, he was totally bad-ass.

54:43.948 --> 54:46.318
I must've wrote Santa half a dozen letters.

54:46.351 --> 54:49.321
Wait a second, you were nine and you still believed in Santa?

54:49.354 --> 54:51.394
I wanted to believe, alright!

54:51.422 --> 54:53.322
Can I finish my story?

54:54.592 --> 54:57.462
Anyway, Christmas morning comes

54:57.495 --> 55:01.625
and I race downstairs and I rip open my gift.

55:01.666 --> 55:05.666
And I see this knock off transformer called "The Flyer".

55:05.703 --> 55:09.613
I didn't say anything, but I was heartbroken.

55:10.775 --> 55:12.675
I tried to hide it,

55:12.710 --> 55:18.550
but I knew my mom could see the disappointment on my face.

55:18.583 --> 55:22.023
And um, that was the last gift she ever got me.

55:23.854 --> 55:25.694
She died six months later.

55:27.124 --> 55:31.134
I know I was only nine, but umm-

55:31.161 --> 55:36.731
I just wish I was more appreciative, you know.

55:36.767 --> 55:39.467
I'll never forget that look on her face.

55:42.072 --> 55:42.872
God.

55:43.674 --> 55:47.614
Ah dude, I mean can we let's, let's,

55:47.645 --> 55:50.945
let's get out of here let's go get a beer.

55:50.981 --> 55:52.781
This place is disgusting.

55:52.817 --> 55:54.047
I don't want to.

55:54.084 --> 55:56.954
Ugh, Jacky, Jack.

55:56.987 --> 56:01.427
I know break-ups suck, but so do new girlfriends.

56:01.459 --> 56:03.089
Lets go get some of those.

56:03.127 --> 56:06.027
Look dude, I know you can't see it right now,

56:06.063 --> 56:08.633
but this was the best thing.

56:08.666 --> 56:10.466
You can focus on writing again.

56:10.501 --> 56:12.971
I'm glad my misery's worked out so well for you.

56:13.003 --> 56:13.803
What?

56:13.838 --> 56:14.968
Don't say that, how's it working-

56:15.005 --> 56:17.605
Look, don't be hatin' me, I'm here trying to help you.

56:17.642 --> 56:19.412
You need to forget about this girl

56:19.444 --> 56:21.454
and the best way to do that is

56:21.479 --> 56:23.449
to bury yourself in what you love.

56:23.481 --> 56:24.651
Forget it, Wilson.

56:24.682 --> 56:26.522
Okay, I'm done.

56:26.551 --> 56:29.591
I'm through with writing.

56:29.620 --> 56:33.560
I'm not 20 years old anymore man.

56:33.591 --> 56:36.561
It's time for me to try something else.

56:36.594 --> 56:39.764
Yeah, great, okay, good.

56:39.797 --> 56:42.197
So uhh, what then?

56:42.232 --> 56:43.702
What? You're gonna do what?

56:43.734 --> 56:46.044
You're gonna go work for daddy?

56:46.070 --> 56:47.440
You're gonna work for daddy!

56:47.472 --> 56:48.642
Screw you, Jack!

56:48.673 --> 56:50.843
I'm not letting you quit because some girl broke your heart

56:50.875 --> 56:53.105
and your too busy feeling sorry for yourself.

56:53.143 --> 56:55.813
Oh and uhh, by the way,

56:55.846 --> 56:58.476
when we came out here we had a deal, remember?

56:58.516 --> 57:01.086
When we had some success and then yes things fell apart

57:01.118 --> 57:05.188
and it got really scary, for me too, it got really really scary.

57:05.222 --> 57:08.732
But we have another chance, right now.

57:08.759 --> 57:15.629
A chance by the way buddy, I scrambled my ass to get us.

57:15.666 --> 57:18.196
So if you're gonna quit, you're gonna quit after.

57:18.235 --> 57:24.775
For now lets put away our shit and do something great.

57:26.811 --> 57:29.151
Have you been watching Rudy again haven't you?

57:29.179 --> 57:31.479
He was little but his dreams were big.

57:37.154 --> 57:37.894
Okay.

57:37.922 --> 57:40.562
Ahhh!

57:40.591 --> 57:41.031
Okay.

57:41.058 --> 57:41.688
Yeah?

57:41.726 --> 57:42.326
Yeah!

57:42.727 --> 57:44.757
I might have a new idea.

57:44.795 --> 57:47.925
Ahh, is it set in space?

57:47.965 --> 57:50.025
It is not set in space.

57:50.067 --> 57:51.237
Beautiful.

57:51.268 --> 57:53.238
Let me hear it.

57:53.270 --> 57:54.170
Okay.

58:15.092 --> 58:16.532
How's my little badger?

58:17.928 --> 58:18.698
Hmm?

58:20.931 --> 58:23.931
Maria, I can't stand to see you like this.

58:23.968 --> 58:26.698
You have to get on with your life.

58:26.737 --> 58:30.577
And stop eating, you're putting on weight.

58:30.608 --> 58:32.638
Gee, thanks, dad.

58:32.677 --> 58:33.877
Thanks for the pep talk.

58:34.745 --> 58:36.905
I'm just saying, nobody wants a fat old wife.

58:36.947 --> 58:39.577
Your weight, you can still do something about.

58:45.355 --> 58:46.555
Where's mom?

58:46.591 --> 58:47.321
Never mind your mother.

58:47.357 --> 58:48.727
I know what you need.

58:48.759 --> 58:50.229
I got you a present.

58:50.661 --> 58:52.001
I'm picking it up later.

58:53.363 --> 58:54.573
What is it?

58:54.599 --> 58:56.569
It's a surprise, Maria.

59:00.871 --> 59:02.641
This better not be a joke.

59:02.673 --> 59:04.143
No jokes here, Maria.

59:04.174 --> 59:05.944
We all know you've been moping around

59:05.976 --> 59:08.706
because you miss a certain someone.

59:08.746 --> 59:10.976
So, I brought him here.

59:13.383 --> 59:14.793
Surprise!

59:14.819 --> 59:15.889
It's the Portuguese doctor!

59:16.153 --> 59:16.923
Hi, Maria.

59:17.655 --> 59:18.785
Hello, Paul.

59:18.823 --> 59:20.593
You surprised, Maria?

59:20.625 --> 59:22.255
I think I'm gonna be sick.

59:23.227 --> 59:25.857
Theres nothing better for sickness than a doctor!

59:26.897 --> 59:27.827
What?

59:31.969 --> 59:33.199
Maria?

59:33.237 --> 59:34.237
Are you alright?!

59:35.405 --> 59:37.165
Yeah, mom, I'm okay.

01:00:01.666 --> 01:00:02.366
So?

01:00:07.772 --> 01:00:09.712
Everything happens for a reason.

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.210
What the hell's that mean?

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:14.112
It means-

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:16.984
congratu-fricken-lations.

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:19.084
You got your funny back, Jack.

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:19.876
Yes!

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:20.747
This is brilliant.

01:00:20.785 --> 01:00:21.785
It's original.

01:00:21.819 --> 01:00:23.649
Man, it's unlike anything you've ever written.

01:00:23.688 --> 01:00:25.858
There's some structure problems but I can fix that

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:29.060
I'll punch it up in a couple days but wow dude wow!

01:00:29.093 --> 01:00:31.733
You think we have a real shot?

01:00:31.762 --> 01:00:35.332
Umm, I think we got ourselves a pilot deal.

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:35.965
Yes!

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:36.900
Well done!

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:38.374
Well done, well done.

01:00:38.402 --> 01:00:39.702
Let's celebrate.

01:00:39.737 --> 01:00:40.707
Cocktail hour at The Beagle.

01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:43.108
I'll call Amy shes gonna bring her friend Lisa.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.710
Beautiful brunette, you will love her.

01:00:44.742 --> 01:00:45.312
Lets do this.

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:46.812
I dunno.

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:48.314
No, no you haven't been out in forever.

01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:50.405
You've been cooped up in here for 48 hours straight,

01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:51.747
you gotta get out.

01:00:51.782 --> 01:00:53.282
And you've got to meet Lisa.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:56.715
This Lisa.

01:00:56.754 --> 01:00:58.864
She also work at the Home Hardware?

01:00:58.889 --> 01:01:02.129
You know I like my women handy.

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:03.729
Alright I'll go.

01:01:03.761 --> 01:01:06.161
I gotta figure out how to fix my toilet anyway.

01:01:06.196 --> 01:01:07.196
Don't lead with that.

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:09.201
Here I'll ah meet you in the car.

01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:10.673
Gotta grab my cell.

01:01:10.868 --> 01:01:12.898
Hurry dude!

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:45.964
Hey Wilson, what's up?

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:47.256
No, I'm just cleaning.

01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:49.097
Why?

01:02:49.133 --> 01:02:50.403
You're kidding?

01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:52.404
They gave us the green-light?!

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:54.866
No, no, I'll be right there.

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:07.893
Mom?

01:03:08.886 --> 01:03:10.046
What is it, Maria?

01:03:10.387 --> 01:03:12.787
Can I talk to you for a minute mom?

01:03:13.257 --> 01:03:14.357
Sure.

01:03:32.342 --> 01:03:35.382
What is it, querida?

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:38.422
Uhh-

01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:43.318
I don't know how to tell you this, uh,

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:45.063
I'm pregnant.

01:03:45.089 --> 01:03:46.289
I know.

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:48.493
Did you tell Jack yet?

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:50.585
You knew?

01:03:50.627 --> 01:03:52.897
A mother senses things.

01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:55.100
Soon you will sense things too.

01:03:55.132 --> 01:03:56.932
You are a lot like me, Maria.

01:03:56.967 --> 01:03:59.597
But you inherited your father's stubbornness.

01:03:59.636 --> 01:04:01.606
Mom, how am I ever gonna tell daddy?

01:04:01.638 --> 01:04:02.838
He's always said he'd rather die

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:06.143
than live with the shame of an unmarried pregnant daughter.

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:07.536
He'll get over it.

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:09.347
He loves you.

01:04:09.379 --> 01:04:11.949
Your father shouldn't be your main concern.

01:04:13.984 --> 01:04:15.494
Do you really love Jack?

01:04:18.255 --> 01:04:19.615
More than anything.

01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:26.497
But it's just not meant to be.

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:29.067
Daddy hates him and Senhora Maria

01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:31.099
says that we're not meant for one another.

01:04:31.135 --> 01:04:35.305
Stop trying so hard to please your father.

01:04:35.339 --> 01:04:38.079
Do what you feel is in your heart.

01:04:39.276 --> 01:04:41.046
As for Senhora Maria,

01:04:41.078 --> 01:04:44.048
I told you to stop seeing her a long time ago.

01:04:44.081 --> 01:04:45.321
I know.

01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:46.919
You can't keep relying on her, Maria.

01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:48.921
What happened to Marco would have happened anyway-

01:04:48.953 --> 01:04:51.463
with or without you.

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:53.158
But she was right.

01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:56.334
Just like she was right about my job,

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.630
right about Uncle Joao's tumor.

01:04:58.662 --> 01:05:01.102
Mom, she's always right!

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:08.010
Not always.

01:05:11.475 --> 01:05:20.445
When I was younger, I was madly in love with this boy.

01:05:20.484 --> 01:05:25.194
When I was with him nothing else mattered.

01:05:25.222 --> 01:05:29.992
He made time stand still.

01:05:30.027 --> 01:05:33.397
Oh, I had a very bad case of love brain.

01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:37.401
Oh god, could he make me laugh.

01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:40.436
We were always laughing.

01:05:42.106 --> 01:05:45.506
So one day he asked me to marry him.

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:47.442
That night, I prayed to God,

01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:51.447
that Senhora Maria would see a bright future for us,

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:53.151
that we were a good match.

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:57.289
When we went to see her,

01:05:57.321 --> 01:06:00.291
she looked me straight in the eye and said,

01:06:00.324 --> 01:06:01.594
"He's not the one".

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:04.363
You see-

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:10.267
I knew he was the one,

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.270
I didn't dare go against the community.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.736
You know how Portuguese people talk.

01:06:20.144 --> 01:06:26.324
So, we broke up and it broke my heart.

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:29.790
A week later, Senhora Maria was calling him every day.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:33.189
She wouldn't give anybody permission to marry him.

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:38.362
I ended up getting married six months later.

01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:44.371
Senhora Maria was in love with dad?

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:47.170
No.

01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:51.406
She was in love with Uncle Joao.

01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:57.211
But that would mean that you and Uncle Joao-

01:06:57.247 --> 01:06:58.717
Were madly in love.

01:07:01.251 --> 01:07:03.251
When I wasn't given permission to marry him,

01:07:03.287 --> 01:07:05.417
I was introduced to his older brother,

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:09.385
your father, and I settled down.

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:16.201
Not knowing the future can be very frightening.

01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:17.733
But it's the beauty of life.

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:22.640
Lose your fears, querida.

01:07:23.507 --> 01:07:26.577
Stop trying to control the future and start living it.

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:28.776
Everybody makes mistakes.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:35.316
But if you're too scared to make them on your own-

01:07:35.352 --> 01:07:38.162
you might miss out on something wonderful.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:43.459
Querida.

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:51.170
I should have listened to my heart, not Senhora Maria.

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:13.460
Hello Jack, I'm umm, I'm pregnant.

01:08:14.658 --> 01:08:15.488
Uhh.

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:17.885
Hello Jack, how are you?

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:20.596
I'm umm, I-I-I'm pregnant.

01:08:21.465 --> 01:08:26.835
No um, hey Jack, umm, guess what?

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.371
Oh come on dummy get a grip.

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:33.779
Okay.

01:09:34.438 --> 01:09:35.468
And, cut!

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:38.680
Perfect, it's looking great guys, looking great.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:41.877
Can we take it one more time from the top of this scene?

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:42.850
Mhmm, yeah.

01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:43.779
Wanna find another joke here?

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:45.923
Yeah, I'll figure it out, I'll figure it out.

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:47.349
It's great though, it's great.

01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:48.894
Brian, this time deliver the line

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:51.358
about the underwear with frustration.

01:09:51.388 --> 01:09:53.417
Like you can't believe she'd even suggest that.

01:09:59.763 --> 01:10:02.203
It looks like the sun will be up soon.

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:03.899
Yeah.

01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:09.371
This is my favorite time, right before dawn.

01:10:09.406 --> 01:10:10.636
So peaceful.

01:10:12.876 --> 01:10:16.606
Before anyone's has had a chance to step out and ruin it all.

01:10:23.487 --> 01:10:26.957
When I first came in here you were listening to something,

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.990
what was it?

01:10:31.695 --> 01:10:34.225
It's a song my cousin wrote.

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:37.733
Mind if I listen?

01:10:42.372 --> 01:10:45.842
Okay, come sit next to me

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:18.726
Ladies and gentleman you've all been so wonderful

01:13:18.762 --> 01:13:21.532
and so patient, we're gonna be going in about five minutes.

01:13:21.565 --> 01:13:22.425
Enjoy the show!

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.208
Five minutes buddy!

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.880
We are gonna kill this.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.009
What if we don't, huh?

01:13:34.043 --> 01:13:36.913
What if our show ends up like the "Marty's Party" pilot.

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:38.716
What is that I never saw that?

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:39.548
Exactly!

01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:40.523
The studio audience was so silent

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:42.520
they pulled the plug before the second act!

01:13:42.552 --> 01:13:44.522
Hey shh, that is not gonna happen here.

01:13:44.554 --> 01:13:45.724
We are gonna rock this!

01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:47.115
I promise you.

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:49.626
I need this, Wilson, this is my last shot.

01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:51.029
I can't work at a Starbucks,

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:53.500
the learning curve there looks ridiculous!

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:54.700
Hey, guys.

01:13:54.731 --> 01:13:56.671
What do think of Senhora Maria's make-up?

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:57.830
I like it.

01:13:57.867 --> 01:13:58.567
Looks good.

01:13:58.602 --> 01:14:00.572
Let's make her creepier, huh?

01:14:00.604 --> 01:14:02.574
Break a leg.

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:03.936
Break legs, Thelma.

01:14:03.973 --> 01:14:06.983
Break legs!

01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:08.180
Nice.

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:10.105
Here we go.

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:12.117
I don't care.

01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:14.578
Mr. Bojangles totally threw me under the bus.

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:17.745
Don't blame Mr. Bojangles.

01:14:18.922 --> 01:14:20.492
You know, I specifically asked you

01:14:20.524 --> 01:14:22.094
if you threw out the bathroom garbage.

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:24.785
And you said, "Yes!"

01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:27.028
I thought I did.

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:29.903
I'm sorry!

01:14:29.933 --> 01:14:32.703
So-

01:14:32.736 --> 01:14:34.566
No uhhh, sex tonight?

01:14:38.775 --> 01:14:41.775
Yes! Yes!

01:14:48.585 --> 01:14:50.515
C'mon man, c'mon!

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:55.222
Don't make fun of Senhora Maria!

01:14:55.258 --> 01:14:57.928
Oh, come on, she's a freakin' fortune teller!

01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:02.029
Who always happens to always be right!

01:15:02.065 --> 01:15:05.665
She was right about my dad, right about your mom,

01:15:05.702 --> 01:15:07.902
right about my dad hooking up with your mom!

01:15:10.807 --> 01:15:12.007
She's never wrong!

01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:15.311
Well, she'swrong about us.

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.684
All I know, is what I know.

01:15:17.714 --> 01:15:21.054
And that's that-

01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:23.194
I love you.

01:15:23.219 --> 01:15:28.089
This is about you and me, not about you, me and Senhora Maria!

01:15:28.124 --> 01:15:29.764
You called?!

01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:06.198
What do you want?

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:07.799
I need to speak with Maria.

01:16:07.831 --> 01:16:09.231
You've done enough to Maria!

01:16:09.265 --> 01:16:12.995
I'm not leaving until I speak to her.

01:16:13.036 --> 01:16:15.666
I should kill you for what you did to Maria!

01:16:15.705 --> 01:16:16.835
You have no respect!

01:16:16.873 --> 01:16:19.743
You come here and use my front door?!

01:16:19.776 --> 01:16:21.206
Nobody uses my front door!

01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:22.384
Not even the mailman!

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:23.851
I'm not leaving.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:25.080
Daddy, who is it?

01:16:25.114 --> 01:16:25.784
Nobody-

01:16:25.815 --> 01:16:26.875
Maria, It's me!

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.316
I have to talk to you.

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:32.817
There's nothing left to say Jack.

01:16:32.856 --> 01:16:34.056
I still love you.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.860
Do you still love me?

01:16:35.892 --> 01:16:36.832
What are you doing?

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:38.900
I'll do anything for another chance with us.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:40.198
Whatever it takes-

01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:42.669
Too much time has passed and I've moved on

01:16:42.699 --> 01:16:43.699
and so have you.

01:16:43.733 --> 01:16:44.703
That's not true.

01:16:44.734 --> 01:16:46.744
I just finished shooting my show and it's all-

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:49.010
I'm not feeling well.

01:16:49.038 --> 01:16:50.338
Goodbye, Jack.

01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:55.339
All you've ever done is upset her.

01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:30.684
Oh, what the hell?!

01:17:30.714 --> 01:17:32.284
Oops, sorry,we uhh-

01:17:32.315 --> 01:17:34.115
we came here to you to celebrate

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:36.290
and you weren't here so we-

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:38.989
we kinda started without you.

01:17:39.022 --> 01:17:40.022
Hey, hey, Jack, uhh-

01:17:40.056 --> 01:17:41.356
Hey.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:44.190
Uh, Lisa from plumbing asks about you all the time.

01:17:44.227 --> 01:17:45.997
Hey dude, we did it!

01:17:46.029 --> 01:17:48.259
The network ordered 12 episodes right away!

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:49.927
We totally banged it man!

01:17:49.966 --> 01:17:52.966
Amy, can I talk to Wilson alone for a sec?

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:56.242
Yeah, yeah of course.

01:17:56.272 --> 01:18:00.212
I'll uhh, see you in the truck my little samosa.

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:02.110
Yes, yes, yes.

01:18:02.145 --> 01:18:03.905
My big big hammer.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.350
Dude, were you mad

01:18:05.381 --> 01:18:08.051
that I was getting my pipes cleaned on your couch?

01:18:08.084 --> 01:18:09.194
No.

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:11.448
I bet you wish you had sprung for scotch-guard now huh.

01:18:13.857 --> 01:18:16.157
You should be drinking with me, we did it!

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:18.762
They're talking about a Thursday night time slot man!

01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:22.725
I went to see Maria.

01:18:22.766 --> 01:18:24.996
And cancelled before we aired.

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:28.814
She wouldn't hear me out and I don't know what to do.

01:18:28.838 --> 01:18:30.438
This isn't going away, is it?

01:18:30.473 --> 01:18:35.513
When we were writing, it was like I was still with her.

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:37.184
I know it's pathetic.

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:38.513
No, I get it.

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:40.317
I get it now that we're done

01:18:40.349 --> 01:18:42.749
you feel like you're losing her all over again.

01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:46.321
Ah, shit buddy.

01:18:50.493 --> 01:18:51.863
Alright.

01:18:55.131 --> 01:18:56.431
I know what to do.

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:05.943
Here we go, here we go.

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:07.335
You ready?

01:19:08.111 --> 01:19:10.251
This is stupid.

01:19:10.947 --> 01:19:12.447
I love you.

01:19:13.049 --> 01:19:14.449
Lets do this.

01:19:14.918 --> 01:19:16.948
Come on, come on.

01:19:18.121 --> 01:19:19.521
This is never gonna work Wilson.

01:19:19.555 --> 01:19:20.785
Yes it will.

01:19:20.824 --> 01:19:24.794
Look, all you gotta do is get the old broad to give you the

01:19:24.828 --> 01:19:27.198
thumbs up and then Maria will take you back.

01:19:27.230 --> 01:19:29.070
Okay, lets do this.

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:30.028
Hey, there.

01:19:33.436 --> 01:19:34.936
Money.

01:19:35.304 --> 01:19:36.874
Nice to see you too.

01:19:36.906 --> 01:19:37.836
Want me to-

01:19:37.874 --> 01:19:39.084
alright.

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:40.808
I know it's nuts, right?

01:19:40.844 --> 01:19:42.454
But what do you got to lose?

01:19:42.478 --> 01:19:43.908
Nothing.

01:19:45.048 --> 01:19:46.418
You're like a little Portuguese ninja.

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:47.849
Shhh!

01:19:53.389 --> 01:19:57.459
I see a quarrel in your past that haunts you.

01:19:57.493 --> 01:19:59.163
I see a reunion!

01:20:00.263 --> 01:20:01.303
A man-

01:20:01.898 --> 01:20:03.528
apologizing.

01:20:03.566 --> 01:20:04.626
Your father-

01:20:06.069 --> 01:20:10.469
he feels guilty because he forced you to play sports.

01:20:10.506 --> 01:20:13.136
He realizes that he's been

01:20:13.176 --> 01:20:16.106
trying to live his dreams through you.

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:17.375
That never happened.

01:20:17.413 --> 01:20:19.153
I'm talking to him!

01:20:19.182 --> 01:20:20.382
Oh my god.

01:20:20.416 --> 01:20:22.146
That makes so much sense now.

01:20:22.185 --> 01:20:25.385
He named me after a volleyball-

01:20:25.421 --> 01:20:29.231
Look Senhora Maria, kay we are here to see my future, not his.

01:20:29.258 --> 01:20:30.428
He paid, not you.

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:35.229
Jack I gotta go, I gotta call my dad.

01:20:41.237 --> 01:20:44.407
I see you chasing a woman.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:46.210
No wait-

01:20:46.242 --> 01:20:47.542
Another.

01:20:48.044 --> 01:20:50.354
I see you chasing two women.

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:51.579
That can't be.

01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:52.484
Who are they?

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:54.015
I see Maria.

01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:55.620
Who's the other?

01:20:55.651 --> 01:20:57.421
Hmmmmm.

01:20:57.453 --> 01:20:59.363
It's to murky, I can't tell.

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:03.629
No no, wait-

01:21:03.659 --> 01:21:05.389
I see an Isabella.

01:21:05.428 --> 01:21:07.058
Okay, look, Senhora Maria.

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:08.026
Here's the deal.

01:21:08.064 --> 01:21:10.074
Ok, I don't know who this Isabella chick is,

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:11.529
but I'm in love with Maria.

01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:14.397
I really need you to do a new reading for us.

01:21:14.437 --> 01:21:17.007
I need you to tell her we're a good match.

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.910
No Maria, no reading.

01:21:19.943 --> 01:21:23.213
Then please call her Senhora Maria

01:21:23.246 --> 01:21:26.476
tell her you want to do a new reading.

01:21:26.515 --> 01:21:29.515
Just please, I'm desperate here.

01:21:29.552 --> 01:21:31.292
You're my last chance.

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:40.264
So, now you want the voo-doo lady's help?

01:21:40.296 --> 01:21:42.296
You should have been a believer!

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:51.013
It's an international flight, you know?

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.510
You're never gonna make it.

01:21:53.009 --> 01:21:55.239
Ahh, I'll drive fast.

01:21:56.445 --> 01:21:58.905
I've got a few more minutes.

01:22:00.984 --> 01:22:02.694
Ahhhh.

01:22:02.718 --> 01:22:04.918
Doesn't feel real to me.

01:22:05.188 --> 01:22:06.258
What?

01:22:06.722 --> 01:22:08.422
Everything.

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:10.257
This whole night.

01:22:10.293 --> 01:22:14.263
You, me, this diner.

01:22:14.297 --> 01:22:17.327
It's like we're inside this other world

01:22:17.366 --> 01:22:20.436
and nothing outside of this booth exists.

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:26.381
It's like ah, were in a zombie movie

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:29.179
and we're the last two people on the planet.

01:22:29.212 --> 01:22:30.412
Yeah.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:32.750
And like we've known each other-

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:35.351
Forever.

01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:42.590
Jack?

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:46.155
What's the craziest thing you've ever done for love?

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:49.127
Start the truck!

01:22:49.165 --> 01:22:49.925
Start the truck!

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:51.495
What the hell are you doing?!

01:22:51.534 --> 01:22:52.744
This is kidnapping!

01:22:52.768 --> 01:22:54.168
If Maria won't come here.

01:22:54.203 --> 01:22:56.143
I'll bring Senhora Maria to her.

01:22:56.172 --> 01:22:57.142
Are you insane?!

01:22:57.173 --> 01:22:58.213
This is kidnapping!

01:22:58.241 --> 01:22:59.581
Wilson, a little help!

01:22:59.608 --> 01:23:04.108
Put me down you son of a bitch.

01:23:04.147 --> 01:23:07.517
I curse you so that bad luck will be the only luck you have!

01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:09.090
She seems angry.

01:23:11.654 --> 01:23:12.424
What is she doing?

01:23:12.455 --> 01:23:14.415
She's trying to give me evil eye.

01:23:14.457 --> 01:23:15.417
What does that mean?

01:23:15.458 --> 01:23:17.028
It's a European thing.

01:23:19.162 --> 01:23:20.602
Amy, get us out of here.

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:22.499
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:23:22.531 --> 01:23:25.301
I am cursing the Patriots too!

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:27.044
Leave them out of this!

01:23:28.771 --> 01:23:29.541
Stop hugging me.

01:23:29.572 --> 01:23:30.542
I'm not hugging you.

01:23:30.573 --> 01:23:32.443
It feels like a hug, let go!

01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:38.405
It didn't have to be like this!

01:23:38.447 --> 01:23:39.147
Come on.

01:23:39.182 --> 01:23:41.752
I'm not going anywhere with you!

01:23:41.784 --> 01:23:43.194
Everybody put gloves on!

01:23:43.219 --> 01:23:43.949
Come on out.

01:23:43.986 --> 01:23:45.786
I am not coming out of this truck

01:23:45.821 --> 01:23:47.391
Don't make me come in there.

01:23:47.423 --> 01:23:50.393
You have to kill me to get me out of this truck.

01:23:50.426 --> 01:23:51.226
Hey!

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:55.430
What are you doing?!

01:23:55.464 --> 01:23:58.804
Whoo-oooo, she is nimble.

01:23:58.834 --> 01:23:59.774
I'm impressed.

01:23:59.802 --> 01:24:01.342
Listen to me, Senhora Maria.

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:03.740
You are gonna tell Maria we are a good match!

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:05.572
You got it?!

01:24:05.608 --> 01:24:08.078
Okay.

01:24:08.111 --> 01:24:09.181
Son of a bitch!

01:24:09.212 --> 01:24:10.212
She bit me!

01:24:10.246 --> 01:24:11.206
Amy you got her?

01:24:11.247 --> 01:24:12.217
Oh, I got her.

01:24:12.248 --> 01:24:13.078
Jack, you alright?

01:24:13.116 --> 01:24:14.216
Come on, lets do this!

01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:15.150
Maria!

01:24:16.319 --> 01:24:17.349
Maria!

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:19.716
I've brought our little friend!

01:24:24.593 --> 01:24:25.833
What are you doing here?!

01:24:25.861 --> 01:24:27.631
I though you'd give up by now!

01:24:27.663 --> 01:24:29.833
If that's what you thought Senhor Moniz

01:24:29.865 --> 01:24:31.495
then you don't know Jack.

01:24:31.534 --> 01:24:34.104
Does anyone have a pen?!

01:24:34.137 --> 01:24:35.497
Call the police, Jose.

01:24:35.538 --> 01:24:37.608
This guy is maluco!

01:24:39.608 --> 01:24:41.438
What are you doing here, Jack?

01:24:41.477 --> 01:24:43.507
You wouldn't hear me out before,

01:24:43.546 --> 01:24:45.746
but I knew you'd listen to Senhora Maria

01:24:45.781 --> 01:24:47.251
if I brought her here.

01:24:47.283 --> 01:24:49.393
So, go ahead, ask her.

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:51.688
Maria, he is not the man for you!

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.190
He has no place in your future!

01:24:54.223 --> 01:24:55.293
He will curse you!

01:24:55.324 --> 01:24:56.634
You shut up!

01:24:56.659 --> 01:24:58.259
I'm sick of listening to you!

01:24:58.294 --> 01:24:59.604
Maria, some respect!

01:24:59.628 --> 01:25:00.758
Not now.

01:25:00.796 --> 01:25:01.596
I demand -

01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:03.230
Enough, dad!

01:25:03.266 --> 01:25:05.626
I am sick and tired of being guilted

01:25:05.668 --> 01:25:09.168
and listening to how everyone thinks I should live my life.

01:25:09.205 --> 01:25:11.505
Sometimes bad things just happen.

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:16.380
Because they do, not because I'm cursed.

01:25:16.412 --> 01:25:18.512
A lousy coincidence-

01:25:18.547 --> 01:25:20.517
that's all they've ever been.

01:25:23.186 --> 01:25:27.616
But there is one person I would like to hear from-

01:25:27.656 --> 01:25:29.426
So, go ahead Jack.

01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:38.628
Maria, I came here because I wanted Senhora Maria's blessing.

01:25:38.667 --> 01:25:40.797
But the truth is-

01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:42.806
I don't believe in her.

01:25:42.838 --> 01:25:44.808
I- I tried,but-

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.440
I can't.

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:48.575
Because I can't believe in anything

01:25:48.611 --> 01:25:52.421
that would want to keep us apart.

01:25:52.448 --> 01:25:56.848
All I know, is what I know.

01:25:56.885 --> 01:25:59.315
And that's that I love you.

01:26:00.756 --> 01:26:03.326
From the first moment we met, I knew it.

01:26:03.359 --> 01:26:05.589
I knew my life would never be the same.

01:26:05.628 --> 01:26:08.398
And it hasn't.

01:26:08.431 --> 01:26:10.701
I've missed you, Maria.

01:26:10.733 --> 01:26:13.473
I have missed your ridiculous superstitions,

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:16.272
your snoring, your obsessive cleaning.

01:26:16.305 --> 01:26:17.565
I don't snore.

01:26:18.974 --> 01:26:21.684
I even miss your insane family.

01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:22.780
Sorry, guys.

01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:24.311
Nahhh.

01:26:24.347 --> 01:26:26.577
I've missed it all.

01:26:26.615 --> 01:26:28.675
If you really feel that way Jack-

01:26:28.717 --> 01:26:31.517
then why did I see you kissing that other woman?

01:26:31.554 --> 01:26:32.424
What?

01:26:32.455 --> 01:26:33.855
What woman?

01:26:33.889 --> 01:26:35.289
The brunette, Jack.

01:26:35.324 --> 01:26:38.494
I saw you kissing her at your place.

01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:39.257
No!

01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:40.325
No, no, no.

01:26:40.363 --> 01:26:43.673
That was an actor who was kissing another actor

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:46.839
who just kinda looks like me.

01:26:46.869 --> 01:26:50.309
I know that sounds like bullshit, but it's not.

01:26:50.339 --> 01:26:51.939
I was directing them for my show,

01:26:51.974 --> 01:26:54.784
which is all about you and me and Senhora Maria

01:26:54.810 --> 01:26:56.280
and your family.

01:26:56.312 --> 01:26:59.352
That's what I was trying to tell you.

01:26:59.382 --> 01:27:01.382
A lot has changed, Jack.

01:27:11.627 --> 01:27:15.927
Would you feel the same way-

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:17.004
if you knew?

01:27:20.035 --> 01:27:21.465
You're uhh-

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.010
Immaculate conception?

01:27:31.547 --> 01:27:33.577
I'm gonna be a dad.

01:27:44.427 --> 01:27:46.897
What is it, what's the matter?

01:27:46.929 --> 01:27:49.529
I think my water just broke.

01:27:49.565 --> 01:27:50.625
Someone call an ambulance!

01:27:50.666 --> 01:27:51.766
Nonsense!

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.770
Maria's decided on a traditional Portuguese home birth.

01:27:54.803 --> 01:27:57.613
So, I'm calling the middlewife, please bring her in.

01:27:59.942 --> 01:28:01.412
Kickin' it old school.

01:28:01.444 --> 01:28:02.414
I like it!

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.750
Just breathe.

01:28:06.782 --> 01:28:08.682
Where's my midwife?

01:28:08.717 --> 01:28:10.917
I don't think I can do this at home.

01:28:10.953 --> 01:28:12.993
I need drugs!

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:14.761
Be right back, sis!

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:16.020
Just breathe, babe.

01:28:16.058 --> 01:28:16.988
Focus.

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:19.755
Close your eyes and go towards the light.

01:28:19.795 --> 01:28:22.595
I'm not dying you idiot!

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:25.071
I'm sorry baby, it's the hormones.

01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:28.600
If it helps, I wrote an episode of Grey's Anatomy about this.

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:30.607
Now no, no, it was not picked up

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:32.609
however I was told it was very authentic.

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:34.381
Okay, yeah, fair enough.

01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:35.810
The middlewife is delivering another baby,

01:28:35.844 --> 01:28:37.054
but I brought some help!

01:28:37.079 --> 01:28:38.449
What do you mean help?!

01:28:40.383 --> 01:28:41.783
You've got to be kidding me?!

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:42.987
Hi Maria, how are you?

01:28:43.018 --> 01:28:44.948
Other than the labor, I'm fine!

01:28:44.987 --> 01:28:47.357
I haven't delivered ababy in a long time!

01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:49.760
I don't think I can just go and do this-

01:28:49.792 --> 01:28:52.632
Get in there.

01:28:52.661 --> 01:28:54.901
Oh, no I remember this, this is familiar.

01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:56.730
Yeah I can do this, yeah, okay.

01:28:56.765 --> 01:28:58.025
This isn't awkward.

01:28:58.066 --> 01:29:00.866
My ex-fiancé delivering my new fiancé's baby.

01:29:00.903 --> 01:29:03.843
Are you engaged?!

01:29:03.872 --> 01:29:04.742
Yes.

01:29:04.773 --> 01:29:06.113
Yeah, we are.

01:29:06.141 --> 01:29:07.641
That is wonderful.

01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:09.446
Why didn't you tell us?!

01:29:09.478 --> 01:29:11.448
We were waiting for the right moment.

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:12.680
Surpria-hhhhh-ise!

01:29:12.715 --> 01:29:14.045
What kind of a man doesn't ask for permission

01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:15.082
from the father's first?!

01:29:15.117 --> 01:29:18.087
Jose, please!

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.060
Will somebody get him a lozenge!

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:22.488
No, don't go south of the boarder!

01:29:22.525 --> 01:29:23.725
All I got is this-

01:29:23.759 --> 01:29:25.559
Oh whoa!

01:29:25.594 --> 01:29:28.004
I just need you to relax, lay back and push.

01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:29.000
I can't anymore!

01:29:29.031 --> 01:29:31.401
You can do this baby, you can do this, ready!?

01:29:31.434 --> 01:29:34.604
I can't.

01:29:34.637 --> 01:29:37.007
You can do this Maria!

01:29:37.039 --> 01:29:40.139
One, two, three.

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:49.045
You're almost there, push hard.

01:29:49.084 --> 01:29:51.954
One, two, three.

01:30:30.793 --> 01:30:33.063
Is it a little football player?

01:30:33.095 --> 01:30:35.655
She sure is.

01:30:38.867 --> 01:30:40.567
Do you wanna hold your daughter?

01:30:50.713 --> 01:30:52.453
A pretty great first, huh?

01:30:54.116 --> 01:30:56.816
Everything we do with her will be a first.

01:30:57.252 --> 01:30:58.592
Her first.

01:31:02.124 --> 01:31:03.594
What's her name?

01:31:03.892 --> 01:31:05.932
I was thinking Isabella?

01:31:12.935 --> 01:31:16.095
Isabella is perfect.

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:23.480
Aww.

01:31:23.712 --> 01:31:26.752
Better safe than sorry.

01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:31.020
For my baby porkchop!

01:31:36.124 --> 01:31:37.894
Congratulations, Avà.

01:31:37.926 --> 01:31:40.156
You too, Avó.

01:31:45.734 --> 01:31:47.865
I love you.

01:31:49.972 --> 01:31:51.742
Best first date ever.

01:31:54.009 --> 01:31:55.779
This wasn't a first date.

01:31:56.779 --> 01:31:57.709
No?

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:08.024
Now it is.

01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:18.301
Lets not make this tougher.

01:32:18.333 --> 01:32:20.273
Long distance doesn't work.

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:25.709
So uhh, just call me when you get back.

01:32:30.746 --> 01:32:32.976
Don't be getting married on me.

01:32:44.159 --> 01:32:46.999
You take care of yourself, Maria.

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:54.000
Good luck in London Jack.

01:33:35.711 --> 01:33:37.181
What if I stayed?

01:33:38.313 --> 01:33:42.953
What if I didn't take the job?

01:33:42.985 --> 01:33:46.045
But let's see where this goes.

01:33:46.088 --> 01:33:48.618
This could get complicated.

01:33:51.259 --> 01:33:53.699
There's only one way to find out.

01:33:56.364 --> 01:33:58.734
I was just secretly wishing that you'd get fired

01:33:58.767 --> 01:34:00.337
and that you'd have to come back.

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:02.168
So you are familiar with my writing.

01:34:17.185 --> 01:34:19.385
Now, where were we-

01:34:23.025 --> 01:34:26.255
It's the choices we make that determine our future.

01:34:26.294 --> 01:34:30.434
But maybe fate or fortune have something to do with it.

01:34:30.465 --> 01:34:34.435
Hmm I used to kid myself that Miss Fortune didn't exist

01:34:34.469 --> 01:34:37.069
but that was before I fell in love with her.
