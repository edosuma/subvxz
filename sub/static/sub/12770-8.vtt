LOOK, OKAY... (exhales)

02:26.166 --> 02:27.375
I WAS...

02:27.417 --> 02:29.083

02:29.125 --> 02:30.166
I SLIPPED.

02:30.208 --> 02:32.000
I WENT ON KIND OF A BENDER,
AND IT...

02:33.291 --> 02:34.542
WELL, IT WAS SCARY.

02:34.583 --> 02:35.750
IT WAS REALLY SCARY.

02:35.792 --> 02:37.291
FOR A MINUTE, I THOUGHT, UM,

02:37.333 --> 02:38.917
I THOUGHT I WAS
GOING OVER THE EDGE.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.375
AND THEN EVEN RYAN
GOT WORRIED ABOUT ME.

AND THEN THERE'S...

02:43.417 --> 02:46.208
WHAT I WAS DOING WAS SCARY.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.709

02:49.750 --> 02:51.792
MANY MEETINGS,
A LOT OF MEETINGS--

02:51.834 --> 02:54.041
AND I AM SO GRATEFUL TO HIM
FOR THAT

02:54.083 --> 02:55.959
BECAUSE HE HELPED ME.
YOU KNOW, HE HELPED.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.709
AND I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT IT WAS 12 DAYS,

02:58.750 --> 03:00.625
AND I CAN JUST IMAGINE
WHAT ALL OF YOU THOUGHT,

03:00.667 --> 03:02.625
AND I AM SO SORRY
THAT YOU THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.

03:02.667 --> 03:05.041

BUT THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.208

03:06.250 --> 03:08.083
AND I WAS GETTING RIGHT
WITH MY HIGHER POWER

03:08.125 --> 03:11.166

OKAY TO ME.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.166
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
AN ADDICT.

03:51.208 --> 03:52.917
(Sam) SHE DIDN'T SEEM
STRUNG OUT.

03:52.959 --> 03:54.291
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
AT HOW ADEPT AN ADDICT CAN BE

03:54.333 --> 03:57.000
AT HIDING THEIR ADDICTION.

03:57.041 --> 03:59.041
I TOYED WITH THE IDEA
OF SPECIALIZING IN ADDICTION

03:59.083 --> 04:00.792
BEFORE I CHOSE FERTILITY.

04:00.834 --> 04:02.166

04:05.083 --> 04:06.166
(clears throat)
IS IT...

04:06.208 --> 04:07.792
POSSIBLE--
I MEAN, IS IT JUST POSSIBLE,

09:15.083 --> 09:17.792
I MEAN, CAN I JUST--
WHAT ARE THE QUALIFICATIONS

09:17.834 --> 09:19.166
FOR THIS ANYWAY?

09:19.208 --> 09:21.375
ARE YOU EVEN--I MEAN, IS THERE
A CERTIFICATION FOR THIS?

09:21.417 --> 09:23.000
ARE YOU QUALIFIED TO DO THIS?

09:23.041 --> 09:24.041
ADDISON--

09:24.083 --> 09:25.208
WE ALL AGREED.

09:25.250 --> 09:26.667
FINE. I'LL GO.

09:33.750 --> 09:37.333
(objects clattering)

09:39.083 --> 09:40.792
LOOK, I KNOW...

09:40.834 --> 09:42.959
THIS IS...

09:44.083 --> 09:46.875
WOULD YOU JUST LISTEN TO
WHAT EVERYONE HAS TO SAY?

09:46.917 --> 09:48.917
ADDISON, I GOT SOBER YOUNG.

09:48.959 --> 09:51.458
AND THEN I SPENT THE BULK
OF MY 20s IN A LIBRARY,

09:51.500 --> 09:53.208
STUDYING MY ASS OFF--

09:53.250 --> 09:57.041
COLLEGE, MED SCHOOL,
RESIDENCY, NEURO FELLOWSHIP.

09:57.083 --> 10:00.208
SO NOW I WANTED TO HAVE
SOME FUN.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.458
I MADE A MISTAKE,
AND NOW I'M FINE.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.709
I WOULD THINK YOU'D GET THAT.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.500
I DO. I GET THAT.

10:06.542 --> 10:09.333
BUT... YOU ARE AN ADDICT,

10:09.375 --> 10:10.500
AMELIA.

10:10.542 --> 10:13.041
YOU DOWN A BOTTLE OF WINE
WITH EVERY MEAL.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.500
YOU DRINK WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY

10:14.542 --> 10:16.500
AND WHEN YOU'RE SAD
AND WHEN IT'S TUESDAY.

10:16.542 --> 10:18.917
SHOULD WE DO AN INTERVENTION
ABOUT YOUR ALCOHOLISM?

10:18.959 --> 10:20.458
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE HERE.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.083
I DON'T NEED TO DRINK.

10:22.125 --> 10:24.041
I HAVEN'T HAD A DRINK
IN MONTHS.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.875
YEAH, BECAUSE THE ONLY THING

10:25.917 --> 10:28.166
YOU'RE MORE ADDICTED TO
THAN BOOZE IS HAVING A BABY,

10:28.208 --> 10:29.709
WHICH IS SAD,
BECAUSE, HELL,

10:29.750 --> 10:31.792
YOU'RE FRIGGIN' BARREN.

10:31.834 --> 10:34.000
YOU WAITED TOO LONG,
AND YOUR JUNK DRIED UP,

10:34.041 --> 10:35.166
AND YOU'VE RUINED ANY MAN

10:35.208 --> 10:37.125
WHO WOULD WANT TO EVEN CONSIDER
IMPREGNATING YOU.

10:37.166 --> 10:40.000
POOR DEREK. POOR MARK.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.458
YOU ABORTED HIS KID, RIGHT?

10:43.500 --> 10:45.750
AND NOW YOU'VE GOT SAM,
AND AT LEAST HE'S SMART ENOUGH

10:45.792 --> 10:47.542
TO NOT WANT TO TRY
AND BREED WITH YOU,

10:47.583 --> 10:48.959
BECAUSE LET'S BE HONEST--

10:49.000 --> 10:50.959
NOT EVEN ROSEMARY'S BABY
WOULD WANT TO LIVE

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
AMONGST THE TUMBLEWEEDS
IN YOUR UTERUS.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.041
MM.

11:00.083 --> 11:01.208
AMELIA--

11:01.250 --> 11:02.709
DUDE, SERIOUSLY?

11:02.750 --> 11:05.500
I BARELY KNOW YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING HERE?

11:05.542 --> 11:08.291
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

11:08.333 --> 11:11.291
I'M HERE BECAUSE WE ALL AGREED
WE WOULD BE HERE.

11:11.333 --> 11:12.834
AND I'M HERE BECAUSE

11:12.875 --> 11:16.041
YOU DON'T GET HOW LONELY
MOST PEOPLE ARE.

11:16.083 --> 11:17.417
SEE, MOST PEOPLE,
THEY JUST GO TO WORK.

11:17.458 --> 11:20.709
THEY GO TO WORK, THEY COME HOME,
MAYBE THEY HAVE FRIENDS.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.041
BUT ON ANY GIVEN DAY,
THEY'RE NOT SHARING AS MUCH

11:23.083 --> 11:25.291
OR CARING AS MUCH
OR GIVING AS MUCH

11:25.333 --> 11:27.083
AS ALL OF YOU GIVE
TO EACH OTHER ON A--

11:27.125 --> 11:30.041
ON AN AVERAGE WEDNESDAY.

11:30.083 --> 11:33.041
SO, YES, YOU'RE RIGHT,
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.250
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE
A FAMILY HERE

11:35.291 --> 11:37.375
AND I SEE
THAT YOU'RE DESTROYING IT.

11:37.417 --> 11:39.667
IF YOU CONTINUE
DOWN THIS PATH,

11:39.709 --> 11:42.375
YOU WON'T JUST
GO DOWN ALONE, AMELIA.

11:42.417 --> 11:45.792
YOU'LL TAKE ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT LOVE YOU DOWN WITH YOU.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.834
WHAT DO WE DO NOW? DO WE
JUST, LIKE, LEAVE, OR IS IT--
COOP.

12:00.875 --> 12:02.041
NO, I'M JUST SAYING,

12:02.083 --> 12:04.041
SHE'S NOT LISTENING.
SHE'S NOT LISTENING.

12:04.083 --> 12:05.792
(Violet) I'M NOT
IN FAVOR OF THIS.

12:05.834 --> 12:08.792
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT GROUP
CONFRONTATIONAL STRATEGIES

12:08.834 --> 12:10.834
WITH ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSERS
DO NOT WORK.

12:10.875 --> 12:13.000
SHE'S GOING TO GO
INTO WITHDRAWAL SOON.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.000
WHAT?

12:14.041 --> 12:15.291
SHE'S USING.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.917
AT A CERTAIN POINT, SHE'S
GOING TO GO INTO WITHDRAWAL.

12:16.959 --> 12:18.041
THAT'S OUR CHANCE.

12:18.083 --> 12:20.041
WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP HER HERE
TILL THAT HAPPENS.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.667
YEAH, BUT SHE'S NOT HIGH
RIGHT NOW.

12:21.709 --> 12:23.208
YES, SHE IS.
NO, SHE'S NOT.

12:23.250 --> 12:26.000
SHE IS. SHE IS.

12:26.041 --> 12:28.041
SHE'LL BE COMING THROUGH
THOSE DOORS ANY MINUTE.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.166
HER HIGH
WILL BE ON ITS WAY OUT,

12:29.208 --> 12:30.583
AND WE STAND BETWEEN HER

12:30.625 --> 12:32.875
AND GETTING OUT OF HERE
TO GET MORE DRUGS.

12:32.917 --> 12:36.458
SHE'LL BE A LITTLE BIT SWEATY,
IRRITABLE, TWITCHY, TWEAKING.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.041
MY GUESS IS,
SHE'S AN OXY GIRL?

12:38.083 --> 12:40.250
NOTHING LIKE OXYCODONE
TO TURN A NICE GIRL

12:40.291 --> 12:42.083
INTO BITCH ON WHEELS.

12:42.125 --> 12:43.208
(groans)

12:43.250 --> 12:44.625
ANY MINUTE...

12:44.667 --> 12:46.667
SHE'S COMING THROUGH
THOSE DOORS.

13:08.792 --> 13:11.875
(footsteps approach)

13:11.917 --> 13:14.166
WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO SAY,
SPIT IT OUT SO I CAN GO.

13:14.208 --> 13:15.709
I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.041
(muffled voice) MY WATCH?
NO. YOU HAVE THE MONEY.

13:31.083 --> 13:33.041
JUST TAKE IT AND GO.

13:33.083 --> 13:34.792
(cocks gun)
JUST... GO.

13:34.834 --> 13:37.166
(Amelia screams)
(Derek) SHH.

13:37.208 --> 13:39.458
(Amelia) MY MOM GAVE MY DAD
THAT WATCH.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.542
IT WAS A SYMBOL
OF THEIR LIFE TOGETHER...
(watch hands clanking)

13:41.583 --> 13:44.750
OF HOW MUCH SHE LOVED HIM.

13:48.041 --> 13:50.291
OKAY. OKAY.

13:50.333 --> 13:52.583
EVERYONE'S GONNA TAKE TURNS
TALKING NOW.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.709
AND THEY'RE ALL HERE
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HELP YOU.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.041
SO TRY TO KEEP THAT IN MIND.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.166
THIS IS NOT ABOUT ANYONE
JUDGING YOU.
(laughs)

13:58.208 --> 13:59.375
THIS IS--
OKAY, LADY.

13:59.417 --> 14:01.041
YOU HAVE CLEARLY
NEVER MET THESE PEOPLE.

14:01.083 --> 14:02.750
(Addison) AMELIA--
FINE.

14:02.792 --> 14:05.000
WHO'S TALKING FIRST?

14:09.542 --> 14:10.500
PERFECT.

14:10.542 --> 14:13.583
SHRINK TALK. MY FAVORITE.

14:13.625 --> 14:15.917
SO, UM,

14:15.959 --> 14:17.125
WE'RE NOT--WE'RE NOT CLOSE,

14:17.166 --> 14:19.041
SO I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
PERSONAL TO...

14:19.083 --> 14:22.583
UH, I WAS JUST GONNA ASK YOU
IF YOU'RE FEELING OKAY.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.333
YOU'RE SWEATING

14:24.375 --> 14:26.041
AND YOUR FOOT IS SHAKING.

14:26.083 --> 14:27.583
AND YOU'RE AGING
AND YOUR HUSBAND HATES YOU.

14:27.625 --> 14:30.041
SO, YOU KNOW,
THINGS COULD BE WORSE FOR ME.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.750
(Pete) A-AMELIA--
IT'S OKAY. PETE. IT'S OKAY.

14:31.792 --> 14:34.000
SHE'S SCARED.
SHE'S LASHING OUT.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.625
I'VE HAD PATIENTS THAT ARE

14:35.667 --> 14:38.041
ANGRIER THAN YOU
AND SICKER THAN YOU,

14:38.083 --> 14:39.542
SO I CAN TAKE IT.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.542
AWESOME. ARE YOU
LOOKIN' FOR APPLAUSE,

14:41.583 --> 14:42.542
AS USUAL?

14:42.583 --> 14:43.542
AMELIA--
IT'S OKAY, PETE.

14:43.583 --> 14:44.750
NO, I-IT'S NOT OKAY.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.333
HONESTLY, PETE,
ALL I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO THINK

14:46.375 --> 14:49.667
SINCE I SAVED YOUR PATHETIC LIFE
IS, WAS IT WORTH IT?

14:49.709 --> 14:51.041
'CAUSE YOU'RE
KIND OF A TOOL.

14:51.083 --> 14:54.083
I MEAN, MAYBE SAVING YOU
WAS A WASTE OF MY ENERGY.

14:54.125 --> 14:57.250
MAYBE IT WAS A WASTE OF
MY MAD, MAD SURGICAL SKILLS.

14:57.291 --> 14:58.834
MAYBE YOU'RE A WASTE OF LIFE.

14:58.875 --> 15:01.709
MAYBE ANGEL-OF-DEATH DUDE
SHOULD CALL IT A DAY

15:01.750 --> 15:03.709
AND SWALLOW SOME PILLS
YOURSELF.

15:03.750 --> 15:06.250
WHAT DO YOU SAY, CROSS ON OVER
TO THE OTHER SIDE?

15:06.291 --> 15:08.250
IT'D GIVE YOUR WIFE SOME GREAT
MATERIAL FOR HER NEXT BOOK,

15:08.291 --> 15:10.083
AND SHE'D LOVE THAT.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.250
THAT'S HER THING--

15:11.291 --> 15:13.041
RAPING HER PERSONAL EXPERIENCES
FOR ATTENTION.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.500
OOPS. DID I SAY RAPE?

15:15.542 --> 15:17.208
SORRY, CHARLOTTE.

15:35.333 --> 15:37.000
(exhales deeply)

15:41.542 --> 15:42.500
(laughs)

15:42.542 --> 15:44.959
(laughs)

15:46.125 --> 15:49.917
(both laughing)

15:56.333 --> 15:58.917
(continues laughing)
OH, MY GOD. ARE YOU OKAY?

15:58.959 --> 16:00.583
YEAH. ARE YOU? (pants)

16:00.625 --> 16:01.750
YEAH.

16:01.792 --> 16:02.959
OH.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.750
(laughing)
SHE'S LIKE A DOG.

16:05.792 --> 16:08.667
SHE'S LIKE...
SHE'S LIKE A CORNERED DOG.

16:08.709 --> 16:12.041
SHE'S LIKE A CORNERED,
INJURED--

16:12.083 --> 16:13.041
(laughing) RABID...

16:13.083 --> 16:14.083
(continues laughing)

16:14.125 --> 16:17.041
RABID DOG. OH.

16:17.083 --> 16:18.041
OH.

16:18.083 --> 16:19.792
OH.
OH.

16:19.834 --> 16:21.083
(exhales)

16:21.125 --> 16:22.166
(exhales)

16:22.208 --> 16:24.291
(sighs)

16:24.333 --> 16:25.375
(door opens)

16:25.417 --> 16:28.041
YOU TWO ALL RIGHT?

16:28.083 --> 16:29.166
YEAH.

16:29.208 --> 16:30.208
YEAH.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.834
DID SHE SHOOT ANYONE YET?

16:31.875 --> 16:33.041
(sighs)

16:33.083 --> 16:34.625
NOT YET.

16:34.667 --> 16:35.834
LOOK, I CAN'T ASK EVERYONE,

16:35.875 --> 16:37.041
BECAUSE WE'RE
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT,

16:37.083 --> 16:38.750
BUT...

16:38.792 --> 16:41.208
I THINK IT'S TIME.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.750
VIOLET?

16:42.792 --> 16:44.333
WHY IS IT ALL ON ME?

16:44.375 --> 16:46.959
YOU'RE THE SHRINK.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.542
(sighs)

16:49.583 --> 16:50.875
DO IT.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.750
IS THIS ALL THERE IS,

16:57.792 --> 16:59.750
YOUR BIG INTERVENTION--
JUST SCREWED UP PEOPLE

16:59.792 --> 17:01.542
TELLING ME HOW SCREWED UP
I AM?

17:01.583 --> 17:04.041
BECAUSE LAST I CHECKED,
I'M A WORLD-CLASS NEUROSURGEON

17:04.083 --> 17:05.583
WITH A NEAR-PERFECT
SURGICAL RECORD.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.041
SO IF YOU WANT TO INTERVENE,
FINE.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.000
I CAN GO ALL DAY.
CAN YOU?

17:10.041 --> 17:11.041
GO ALL DAY?

17:11.083 --> 17:12.875
ARE WE TALKING
IN RIDDLES NOW?

17:12.917 --> 17:14.041
ARE YOU THE RIDDLER?

17:14.083 --> 17:16.583
(chuckles)
ARE YOU RIDDLING ME STUFF
RIGHT NOW?

17:16.625 --> 17:18.792
BECAUSE I MIGHT NEED A PEN
TO WRITE THIS DOWN.
(laughs) I GOTTA ADMIT,

17:18.834 --> 17:20.583
I'M KIND OF LOVING YOU
RIGHT NOW.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.458
I AM LOVING YOU.

17:22.500 --> 17:26.250
YOU ARE WINNING
BETTER THAN CHARLIE SHEEN...

17:26.291 --> 17:30.000
AS LONG AS I OVERLOOK THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE A GIANT OXY ADDICT

17:30.041 --> 17:31.583
WHO'S KILLING HERSELF.

17:31.625 --> 17:34.041
EVERYONE HERE
IS IN AGREEMENT.

17:34.083 --> 17:36.625
YOU WILL
NO LONGER BE ENABLED.

17:36.667 --> 17:38.041
ENABLED?

17:38.083 --> 17:40.709
IS THAT ONE OF YOUR SPECIAL
S.A.T. WORDS?

17:40.750 --> 17:42.875
I'LL CHANGE THE LOCKS.

17:42.917 --> 17:44.083
UNTIL YOU GET HELP,
I'LL CHANGE THE LOCKS.

17:44.125 --> 17:45.542
YOU CAN'T LIVE
AT MY HOUSE ANYMORE.

17:49.291 --> 17:51.834
I WILL CHANGE THE LOCKS.

17:51.875 --> 17:53.625
I WILL THROW YOU OUT.

17:53.667 --> 17:54.834
THEN I WILL
CALL IN YOUR MOTHER

17:54.875 --> 17:56.291
AND YOUR BROTHER
AND YOUR SISTERS,

17:56.333 --> 17:58.041
AND THEN I WILL CALL
THE MEDICAL BOARD

17:58.083 --> 18:00.166
AND REPORT YOU,
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU, AMELIA,

18:00.208 --> 18:02.834
BUT I WILL NOT
LOVE YOU TO DEATH.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.291
WATER?

18:25.959 --> 18:27.917
BUPE.

18:27.959 --> 18:29.917
NICE LITTLE DRUG.

18:29.959 --> 18:31.417
YOU DISSOLVE IT IN WATER.

18:31.458 --> 18:34.625
IT'LL MAKE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS
GO AWAY IMMEDIATELY.

18:34.667 --> 18:35.875
IT'LL ALSO PREVENT ANY DRUGS

18:35.917 --> 18:37.250
FROM GETTING ME HIGH
FOR 72 HOURS.

18:37.291 --> 18:38.834
EXCELLENT WORK.

18:38.875 --> 18:40.834
BIG PHARMA HAS DONE US ALL
A FAVOR.

18:40.875 --> 18:43.041
AMELIA, PLEASE.
IT COULD HELP YOU.

18:43.083 --> 18:44.291
(Pete)
IT'LL AT LEAST GIVE YOU

18:44.333 --> 18:45.709
A CHANCE TO HEAR US
WITHOUT BEING HIGH,

18:45.750 --> 18:47.041
WITHOUT GOING THROUGH
WITHDRAWAL.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.500
I TOLD YOU, I'M DRUG FREE.
I HAVE BEEN FOR FIVE DAYS.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.083
I AM NOT
GOING THROUGH WITHDRAWAL.

18:51.125 --> 18:53.000
I'M CLEAN.

18:53.041 --> 18:54.375
WELL, THEN TAKE THE BUPE.

18:54.417 --> 18:56.125
AMELIA, WE ALL LOVE YOU.
IT--

18:56.166 --> 18:58.125
IT'LL HELP YOU FEEL BETTER.
GIVE IT A SHOT.

18:58.166 --> 19:01.709
THEN WE CAN TALK YOU
THROUGH THIS.

19:01.750 --> 19:03.542
PLEASE.

19:11.083 --> 19:14.041
YOU WANT ME TO STAY AND LISTEN
SO THAT I CAN GET SOBER?

19:14.083 --> 19:15.959
(Charlotte) YES.

19:19.083 --> 19:20.834
OKAY.

WHAT, BE LOCKED UP,

22:23.625 --> 22:25.583
INSTITUTIONALIZED
INSTEAD OF TREATED?

22:25.625 --> 22:28.500

RESPONSIBILITY FOR HER ACTIONS.

22:28.542 --> 22:29.792
YOU THINK PETE

22:29.834 --> 22:31.000
SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HIS HEART ATTACK?

22:31.041 --> 22:33.041
UH, THAT'S NOT
THE SAME THING.

22:33.083 --> 22:34.917
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE PETE
HAS HEART DISEASE.

22:34.959 --> 22:36.083
AMELIA HAS A DISEASE, TOO.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.041
THAT'S YOUR OPINION.
LOOK...

22:38.083 --> 22:40.542
JAKE, WE BOTH KNOW THAT
THAT IS UP FOR DEBATE

22:40.583 --> 22:43.041
IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY,
ALL RIGHT?

22:43.083 --> 22:44.542
THE WHOLE DISEASE MODEL
COMES FROM A.A.,

22:44.583 --> 22:46.041
WHERE THE FIRST THING
THEY TRY TO DO

22:46.083 --> 22:47.333
IS GET PEOPLE TO ADMIT

22:47.375 --> 22:49.333
THAT THEY'RE POWERLESS
AGAINST THEIR ADDICTION.

22:49.375 --> 22:51.041
BECAUSE DRUGS FUNCTION
DIFFERENTLY IN THEIR BODIES.

22:51.083 --> 22:53.125
ADDICTION IS
A THREEFOLD DISEASE.

22:53.166 --> 22:54.959
IT'S A "DISEASE"
THAT DOESN'T FIRE UP

22:55.000 --> 22:56.750
UNLESS YOU TAKE THE DRUGS.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.750

OVER THAT, RIGHT?

22:58.792 --> 23:00.041

SHE TOOK THOSE DRUGS,

23:01.625 --> 23:03.959
JUST LIKE SHE HAS
A CHOICE TODAY.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.625
(scoffs) WOW.

23:05.667 --> 23:07.333
YOU THINK
PEOPLE CHOOSE THAT MISERY?

23:07.375 --> 23:09.041
YOU THINK THEY--YOU THINK
THEY CHOOSE THAT LIFE?

23:09.083 --> 23:10.333
YOU THINK THEY WANT TO BE

23:10.375 --> 23:12.041
LICKING DRUGS
OFF OF BATHROOM FLOORS

23:12.083 --> 23:14.834
AND NEGLECTING THEIR KIDS
AND DESTROYING THEIR HUSBANDS

23:14.875 --> 23:16.166
AND KILLING THEMSELVES?

23:16.208 --> 23:18.583
YOU THINK ANYONE WHO IS NOT
IN THE THROES OF A DISEASE

23:18.625 --> 23:21.041
WOULD CONSCIOUSLY DO THAT
TO THEMSELVES?

23:21.083 --> 23:23.041
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?
(Violet) JAKE.

23:23.083 --> 23:24.041
WHAT?

23:25.834 --> 23:27.000
NO. (clears throat)

23:27.041 --> 23:28.625

LOTS OF US IN THERE.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.875

FLYING AROUND TODAY.

GET BACK IN THERE.

ABSOLUTELY NOT.

WHO CARE ABOUT YOU.

26:30.542 --> 26:32.458

26:32.500 --> 26:35.625
OR DON'T DO THE DRUGS
AT ALL,

26:35.667 --> 26:37.208
AND SHOW THEM
WHO YOU WANT TO BE.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.000

27:36.750 --> 27:39.208
SURE AS I'M SITTING HERE,

27:39.250 --> 27:41.083
IF YOU KEEP UP AT THIS,

27:41.125 --> 27:44.041
YOU'RE GONNA KILL SOMEONE.

27:44.083 --> 27:46.041
YOU'RE GONNA
WALK INTO SOME O.R.,

27:46.083 --> 27:49.542
YOU'RE GONNA GET BEHIND
THE WHEEL OF A CAR...

27:49.583 --> 27:52.125
YOU'RE GONNA KILL SOMEONE,
AMELIA.

27:52.166 --> 27:54.959
THAT'S WHERE THIS GOES.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.417
AND WHEN YOU DO...

27:56.458 --> 27:58.625
WHEN YOU DO THAT,

27:58.667 --> 28:00.041
YOU DON'T COME BACK
FROM IT.

28:00.083 --> 28:02.041
MAYBE YOU GET SOBER...

28:02.083 --> 28:04.542
BUT YOU DON'T COME BACK.

28:04.583 --> 28:08.333
YOU SPEND EVERY DAY
TRYING TO BE A BETTER PERSON,

28:08.375 --> 28:10.041
TRYING TO SAVE A LIFE,

28:10.083 --> 28:12.041
TRYING TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

28:12.083 --> 28:14.041
BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE
THAT MOTHER BACK HER CHILD

28:14.083 --> 28:16.834
OR THAT HUSBAND BACK
HIS WIFE.

28:16.875 --> 28:20.166
YOU WALK AND YOU TALK
AND YOU BREATHE,

28:20.208 --> 28:24.041
AND SOMETIMES YOU EVEN
SMILE OR LAUGH...

28:24.083 --> 28:27.208
BUT YOU DON'T COME BACK.

28:30.083 --> 28:32.375
OKAY, I GOTTA ASK.

28:32.417 --> 28:33.792
WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS NOW?

28:33.834 --> 28:35.333
SHE'S SO HIGH,
SHE CAN'T EVEN LISTEN TO US.

28:35.375 --> 28:36.583
(Amelia) I'M LISTENING.

28:39.417 --> 28:41.792
WHAT CHARLOTTE SAID
WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL...

28:44.083 --> 28:46.083
AND REAL.

28:48.083 --> 28:50.875
AND I WORRY ABOUT THAT.

28:50.917 --> 28:52.291
I DO.

28:56.667 --> 28:58.625
JUST GIVE US 30 DAYS--

28:58.667 --> 29:00.500
30 DAYS TO GET YOU
CLEAN AND SOBER--

29:00.542 --> 29:02.583
THEN YOU CAN START OVER AGAIN.

29:02.625 --> 29:05.041
A CLEAN SLATE.

29:06.709 --> 29:08.875
(voice breaking)
THAT SOUNDS NICE, BUT I...

29:08.917 --> 29:10.875
I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO IT.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.000
OH, YOU CAN.

29:12.041 --> 29:13.500
YOU CAN. I KNOW YOU CAN.

29:13.542 --> 29:15.834
WE'LL HELP YOU.
I'LL HELP YOU.

29:15.875 --> 29:17.208
AMELIA, PLEASE.
(Amelia sniffles)

29:17.250 --> 29:20.917
THERE'S A GREAT REHAB FACILITY.
THEY HAVE A BED WAITING FOR YOU.

29:20.959 --> 29:23.208
IT'S... IT'S RIGHT NEAR
THE OCEAN.

29:23.250 --> 29:25.041
(breathes shakily)

29:25.083 --> 29:27.333
(sniffles)

29:27.375 --> 29:29.000
WILL YOU COME, TOO?

29:30.875 --> 29:33.417
I'LL COME SEE YOU
EVERY DAY.

29:33.458 --> 29:35.041
I'LL... I WILL.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.417
I'LL BE THERE.

29:36.458 --> 29:37.417
(sniffles)

29:37.458 --> 29:39.792
I'LL BE THERE.
YEAH, I WILL.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.041
(sniffles)

29:43.083 --> 29:44.792
(elevator bell dings)

29:49.333 --> 29:51.458
RYAN.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.667
OOF.

29:54.709 --> 29:56.750
OH!

30:14.083 --> 30:15.917
(Sam) YOU NEED TO GO.

30:15.959 --> 30:16.917
SAM--

30:16.959 --> 30:17.917
NO. HE'S GOTTA GO.
LEAVE.

30:17.959 --> 30:19.250
RYAN AND I ARE GETTING MARRIED.
NOW.

30:19.291 --> 30:20.583
DON'T SPEAK TO HIM
LIKE THAT.
(Pete) YOU REALIZE

30:20.625 --> 30:22.458
YOU'LL NEVER GET SOBER
IF YOU STAY WITH HIM, EVER.

30:22.500 --> 30:24.250
AMELIA'S ADDICTION
IS NOT RYAN'S FAULT.

30:24.291 --> 30:26.750
AS A MATTER OF FACT, RYAN,
IF YOU WANT TO GET SOBER,

30:26.792 --> 30:28.792
WE'LL HELP YOU, TOO.
NO, NO, WE WON'T.

30:28.834 --> 30:30.333
(Violet) YES, WE WILL,
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES.

30:30.375 --> 30:32.959
NO, OUR COMMITMENT,
OUR CONCERN IS FOR AMELIA.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.125
I KNOW, AND SHE WILL DO BETTER

30:34.166 --> 30:35.917
IF THE PERSON SHE LOVES
IS ALSO IN THE PROGRAM,

30:35.959 --> 30:37.083
IS GETTING SOBER AS WELL.

30:37.125 --> 30:38.542
THERE'S STUDIES ON THIS.
SHELDON, BACK ME UP.

30:38.583 --> 30:40.333
OKAY, I JUST THINK WE NEED
TO DISCUSS THIS BEFORE WE S--

30:40.375 --> 30:42.333
I THINK WHAT VIOLET
AND LENNY SAID IS RIGHT.

30:42.375 --> 30:44.750
I BELIEVE WE CAN HELP ANYONE
WHO WANTS TO GET SOBER.

30:44.792 --> 30:47.625
HE DIDN'T SAY
HE WANTS TO GET SOBER.

30:50.583 --> 30:55.041
YOU GAVE HIM
YOUR FATHER'S WATCH?

30:55.083 --> 30:56.417
AMELIA.

30:56.458 --> 30:57.959
AMELIA, LOOK AT ME.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.375
IT'S HIS ENGAGEMENT PRESENT.

30:59.417 --> 31:01.458
IT'S YOUR FATHER'S WATCH.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.208
LEAVE ME ALONE.

31:03.250 --> 31:04.834
MAYBE JUST GIVE HER
A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE--

31:04.875 --> 31:06.583
THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!
I AM SPEAKING TO MY SISTER!

31:06.625 --> 31:07.667
I'M NOT YOUR SISTER.
LOOK AT THIS.

31:07.709 --> 31:09.375
YOU TOOK THIS
FROM YOUR MOTHER?

31:09.417 --> 31:12.000
DO YOU KNOW HOW THAT'S
GONNA MAKE HER FEEL?

31:12.041 --> 31:13.375
(Lenny) OKAY,
LET'S, EVERYONE, CALM DOWN.

31:13.417 --> 31:15.041
WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF THE WATCH?

31:15.083 --> 31:17.041
NOTHING. IT'S A WATCH.
AMELIA.

31:17.083 --> 31:19.208
MY MOM GAVE IT TO MY DAD
FOR THEIR ANNIVERSARY ONE YEAR.

31:19.250 --> 31:21.208
THAT IS NOT THE SIGNIFICANCE.
ADDISON--

31:21.250 --> 31:23.208
IT'S NOT,
AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT, SAM.

31:23.250 --> 31:25.750
AMELIA.

31:25.792 --> 31:28.041
TWO GUYS CAME INTO
HER FATHER'S STORE

31:28.083 --> 31:29.041
WHEN SHE WAS 5 YEAR--
SHUT UP!

31:29.083 --> 31:30.041
(Sam) WHOA.

31:30.083 --> 31:31.542
YOU DO NOT TELL THAT STORY!

31:31.583 --> 31:33.041
THAT IS NOT YOUR STORY!
HE WAS NOT YOUR DAD!

31:33.083 --> 31:35.041
HE WAS MY DAD!

31:35.083 --> 31:36.875
YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

31:36.917 --> 31:38.417
SHUT UP,

31:38.458 --> 31:41.250
YOU STUPID,
IGNORANT MONSTER BITCH!

31:41.291 --> 31:44.041
YOU DO NOT TELL THAT STORY.

31:44.083 --> 31:46.667
YOU DO NOT EVER
TELL THAT STORY.

31:46.709 --> 31:50.041
YOU EVER TELL THAT STORY
TO ANYONE...
(speaks indistinctly)

31:50.083 --> 31:52.917
AND I WILL KILL YOU
WITH MY BARE HANDS.

31:52.959 --> 31:54.250
(sobs)
(Ryan speaks indistinctly)

31:54.291 --> 31:56.458
LET'S GO. I WANT TO GO.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.834
(sniffles and cries)

31:59.709 --> 32:03.291
COME ON. PLEASE...
STAY.

32:03.333 --> 32:04.667
SHELDON...

32:04.709 --> 32:07.250
I WILL NEVER LOVE YOU BACK.

32:07.291 --> 32:09.875
YOU GET THAT, RIGHT?

32:09.917 --> 32:11.041
(elevator bell dings)

32:11.083 --> 32:13.583
(doors open)

32:15.583 --> 32:16.709
IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU ALL.

32:16.750 --> 32:18.709
HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN
REAL SOON

32:18.750 --> 32:21.291
WHEN THINGS CALM DOWN.
(pushes button)

32:26.083 --> 32:28.041
(Amelia)
WE'RE IN THE BACK OF THE STORE.

32:28.083 --> 32:30.125
DAD HAS JUST GIVEN ME
TWO PENNIES.

32:30.166 --> 32:31.875
TWO GUYS COME IN.

32:31.917 --> 32:33.500
WE CAN HEAR THEM TALKING.

32:33.542 --> 32:35.041
(men speaking indistinctly)

32:35.083 --> 32:36.333
BUT WE DON'T PAY ATTENTION
UNTIL DAD YELLS.

32:36.375 --> 32:38.917
(men speaking indistinctly)

32:38.959 --> 32:39.959
(Amelia screams)

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
SHH.

32:43.083 --> 32:46.041
TWO GUYS SHOT MY DAD
FOR HIS WATCH.

32:46.083 --> 32:47.959
(gunshot)

32:54.208 --> 32:55.709
(jingles)

33:23.375 --> 33:25.375
YOUR--YOUR FRIENDS, UM...

33:27.000 --> 33:30.041
NO ONE'S EVER TRIED
TO SAVE ME LIKE THAT.

33:30.083 --> 33:31.625
NO ONE'S EVER CARED ENOUGH.

33:31.667 --> 33:35.917
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN AROUND
ANYONE LIKE YOU BEFORE.

33:35.959 --> 33:38.000
YOU MAKE ME WANT...

33:40.375 --> 33:42.333
YOUR MOM GAVE YOUR DAD
THIS WATCH

33:42.375 --> 33:44.000
FOR THEIR ANNIVERSARY.

33:45.166 --> 33:47.875
I WANT TO HAVE ANNIVERSARIES
WITH YOU,

33:47.917 --> 33:50.166
LOTS OF 'EM,

33:50.208 --> 33:52.208
AND KIDS.

33:57.083 --> 34:00.667
IF WE WERE SOBER,
WE COULD HAVE KIDS

34:00.709 --> 34:02.041
AND A LIFE.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.375
WE COULD HAVE A LIFE, TOO.

34:05.875 --> 34:07.417
YOU WANT KIDS?

34:07.458 --> 34:09.583
WE'D HAVE TO BE CLEAN.

34:09.625 --> 34:11.333
MY FATHER WAS A COKEHEAD,

34:11.375 --> 34:14.041
AND I WON'T--I...

34:14.083 --> 34:16.041
I CAN'T.

34:16.083 --> 34:17.792
WE HAVE TO BE CLEAN.

34:19.041 --> 34:21.500
OKAY.

34:21.542 --> 34:24.417
DO YOU WANT TO GET SOBER
WITH ME?

34:24.458 --> 34:26.834
YEAH.

34:26.875 --> 34:28.709
(both laugh)

34:28.750 --> 34:30.667
LET'S GET SOBER TOGETHER.

34:35.083 --> 34:36.500
THIS IS GREAT.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.917
THIS IS GONNA BE SO GREAT.

34:37.959 --> 34:39.917
IT IS. I CAN GET THE NAMES
OF SOME REHAB PLACES,

34:39.959 --> 34:41.291
AND WE GO IN TOGETHER
AND WE GO OUT TOGETHER.

34:41.333 --> 34:43.500
THIS IS A COMMITMENT.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

34:43.542 --> 34:46.375
CAN YOU DO THIS? 'CAUSE IF
YOU CAN'T, WE CAN AL--

34:46.417 --> 34:47.583
I CAN DO IT. I CAN.

34:47.625 --> 34:48.917
(laughs)

35:00.083 --> 35:02.041
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
FLUSH THESE.

35:02.083 --> 35:04.750
YEAH. YEAH.

35:04.792 --> 35:07.208
OR...

35:07.250 --> 35:09.041
ONE LAST TIME?

35:09.083 --> 35:11.041
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.

35:11.083 --> 35:14.000
OKAY. OKAY, FLUSH 'EM.

35:23.709 --> 35:25.125
ONE LAST TIME.

35:28.083 --> 35:31.000
(crinkling baggie)

35:33.625 --> 35:36.917
SO HOW MANY KIDS
DO YOU WANT?

35:36.959 --> 35:39.458
THREE.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.250
TWO BOYS...

35:41.291 --> 35:43.291
AND A GIRL.

35:45.083 --> 35:46.792
HOW ABOUT FOUR?

35:46.834 --> 35:48.083
(taps object)

35:48.125 --> 35:52.375
TWO BOYS, TWO GIRLS--THAT WAY,
NO ONE GETS LONELY.

35:52.417 --> 35:54.166
DEAL?

35:56.125 --> 35:58.000
DEAL.

36:27.375 --> 36:31.959
(voice distorts)
YOU ARE SO GORGEOUS.

36:40.083 --> 36:41.750
(Cooper) WHAT NOW?

36:41.792 --> 36:43.125
(Lenny) NOW YOU
HAVE TO CUT HER OFF.

36:43.166 --> 36:45.000
WHEN AMELIA CALLS,
AND SHE WILL CALL,

36:45.041 --> 36:49.041
UNLESS SHE'S READY FOR HELP,
YOU DON'T GIVE HER A RIDE.

36:49.083 --> 36:50.458
YOU DON'T GIVE HER MONEY

36:50.500 --> 36:53.125
OR A PLACE TO STAY
OR HER JOB BACK.

36:53.166 --> 36:55.208
THE ONLY CALL
YOU CAN RESPOND TO

36:55.250 --> 36:57.250
IS AMELIA CALLING YOU FOR HELP
TO GET OFF DRUGS.

36:57.291 --> 36:58.667
THAT'S IT.

36:58.709 --> 37:00.041
IT'S UP TO HER NOW.

37:00.083 --> 37:01.959
THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.750
THIS IS WHAT WORKS.
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.

37:03.792 --> 37:04.750
(Pete)
SHE'S OUT ON THE STREET.

37:04.792 --> 37:05.750
DOING GOD KNOWS WHAT.

37:05.792 --> 37:06.750
(Cooper) YEAH, WITH RYAN.

37:06.792 --> 37:07.709
WE LOST HER.

37:07.750 --> 37:09.083
NO, I LOST HER.

37:09.125 --> 37:11.375
I LOST HER.

37:11.417 --> 37:14.041
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. WE STARTED
SOMETHING FOR HER TODAY.

37:14.083 --> 37:16.041
PROGRESS WAS MADE.

37:16.083 --> 37:18.709
YOU MAY NOT SEE IT.
SOMETIMES IT TAKES TIME.

37:18.750 --> 37:20.625
RESULTS AREN'T ALWAYS
IMMEDIATE.

37:20.667 --> 37:24.834
SOMETIMES... AN ADDICT
ACTUALLY HAS TO HIT ROCK BOTTOM.

37:24.875 --> 37:27.792
(scoffs, voice breaks)
AMELIA SNORTING OXYCODONE

37:27.834 --> 37:31.000
OFF THE RECEPTION DESK
DOESN'T QUALIFY AS ROCK BOTTOM?

37:39.083 --> 37:42.667
15 YEARS, 3 MONTHS,
AND 4 DAYS AGO,

37:42.709 --> 37:45.250
I TOOK MY 5-YEAR-OLD SON
TO THE PARK.

37:45.291 --> 37:47.333
HE WAS ON THE SWINGS,
HAVING SO MUCH FUN.

37:47.375 --> 37:49.041
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

37:49.083 --> 37:50.834
THE SUN WAS SHINING.

37:50.875 --> 37:52.458
HE HAD OTHER KIDS
TO PLAY WITH.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.083
WE HAD ALL AFTERNOON.

37:54.125 --> 37:57.250
HE WAS ON THE SWINGS.
HE WAS OKAY.

37:57.291 --> 37:59.875
I KNEW HE WAS, 'CAUSE I COULD
HEAR HIM LAUGHING

37:59.917 --> 38:03.834
AS I WAS SHOOTING THE TENNER
OF HEROIN I HAD ON ME.

38:03.875 --> 38:04.959
I PASSED OUT.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.250
I CAME TO

38:07.291 --> 38:09.041
