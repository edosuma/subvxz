00:17.920 --> 00:20.760
Can we get some snacks

00:20.800 --> 00:23.600
Sixpack, maybe. Neeks,

00:27.200 --> 00:29.200
Sixpack,
bag of chips for me.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.560
Don't think I'd hesitate
cutting your fuckin' tongue.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.200
That's not very nice.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.440
Ah, here we go.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.560
Which one of you
is good cop, then?

00:46.800 --> 00:48.080
Not you.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.920
Are you
ready to talk?

00:49.960 --> 00:53.080
Little itch. Little itch
here, bro. Give us...

00:56.360 --> 00:58.760
Oh, fair enough.
I deserved that.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.920
I hit on your girlfriend. <i></i>

Pick up, pick up!

01:19.520 --> 01:22.600
Wait!
You can't leave!

01:23.720 --> 01:25.280
We can protect you.

01:25.320 --> 01:28.960
Protect us from whatever those
things are?! I don't think so.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.680
We're out.
Tessa, get in the car.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.960
Sorry, Aunty. <i></i>

01:53.000 --> 01:55.520
I'm goin' down there.
I'll do it myself.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.800
Do you even know how to
use any of this stuff?

01:57.840 --> 01:59.880
Well, at least I'm tryin'
to do something.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.520

the blood hunters were dead.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.960
Tell me about you.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.880
I'm the blackfella
who's gonna kill you.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.480
You monsters took my mum.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.840
We did. And she's
one of the tasty ones.

03:54.440 --> 03:55.880
Isn't she, Scarlett?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.440
Stop! Stop it.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.120
This is my fault.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.360
Made a deal with Eleona.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.600
She promised we'd get
my mum if we...

04:19.800 --> 04:21.080
..helped kill you.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.000

05:01.080 --> 05:02.800
And I know you've
been sober for years,

05:02.840 --> 05:06.080
but after all this, if you
want to drink, it's on me.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.960
I'm not here to drink.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.440
Come to see a man
who knows how to get things.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.200
What kind of things?

05:26.240 --> 05:27.720
Yeah, what kind of things?

05:27.760 --> 05:29.560
Dynamite. I wanna go mining.

05:29.600 --> 05:33.000
There's other places in town
that sell that.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.240
Yeah, but I want it now.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.440
No paperwork.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.240

My great-grandad
broke ground here in 1923.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.360
Then realised he'd make
more money selling alcohol

06:31.400 --> 06:34.000
to the miners
than getting dirty himself.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.600
Dug these tunnels
to run the grog.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.120
Hey, you seen Tyson?

06:39.160 --> 06:41.960
No. He hasn't been here
in days.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.200
This...will make it go boom.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.040
I'll be the judge of that.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.800
My uncle was a miner.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.960
Looks pretty sweaty
to me.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.440
Wouldn't blow up an anthill.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.080
- Are you calling me a liar?
- No.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.000
I'm calling you a racist.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.000
Think you can rip us off
'cause we're black?

07:02.040 --> 07:03.000
Kitty!

07:03.040 --> 07:04.600
No, Smokey.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.640
Spud here's taking you
for a ride.

07:06.680 --> 07:09.440
Who do you think built
these tunnels? Not your family.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.440
Blackfellas did it in chains
while your family got rich.

07:12.480 --> 07:13.840
I don't need this.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.560
Have your shitty
dynamite back, then.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.200
I should have
done this on my own!

07:18.240 --> 07:19.640
Get out of here.

07:30.160 --> 07:31.640
Nah.
You're playin' games.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.680
Listen, there's a blood bag down
there. Something's not right.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.240
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Fine! Go, then!

07:56.160 --> 07:57.880
Sorry, Tyson.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:20.440 --> 08:22.680
Where's Tyson and Shanika?

08:23.680 --> 08:25.080
How should I know?

08:25.120 --> 08:26.360
You sure?

08:27.600 --> 08:30.480
Sure you don't know about things
that go bite in the night?

08:30.520 --> 08:32.560
What are you talkin' about?

08:32.600 --> 08:36.800
I seen that blood bag out
the back, Tyson's car outside.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.920
He went down one of
your tunnels, didn't he?

08:41.240 --> 08:43.400
Are you trading
with the vampires?

08:43.440 --> 08:46.560
Hey!
I didn't say get up.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.000

You don't ask any questions.
You don't muck around.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.600
Stake straight
through the heart.

You can.

Well, let us help you do it.

No!

didn't happen...
