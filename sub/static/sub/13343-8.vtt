00:06.640 --> 00:09.943
* Just a little boy lost
looking for a lamb *

00:10.044 --> 00:12.813
* In the all-night city

00:12.913 --> 00:18.052
* Living in
his lonely limousine *

00:18.152 --> 00:21.289
* And though
he never has to worry *

00:21.389 --> 00:24.292
* He's the only one
and only one *

00:24.392 --> 00:26.227
* He's ever gonna need

00:26.327 --> 00:29.697
* Absolutely,
he's in definite need *

00:29.797 --> 00:33.834
* Ooh, maybe we've been
alone too long *

00:33.934 --> 00:36.870
* You don't
want to be lonely *

00:36.970 --> 00:39.440
* Maybe we've been
alone too long *

00:39.540 --> 00:44.512
* You don't want
to be lonely. *

00:49.117 --> 00:51.119
- Ooh, yeah.
- Stuart: Mm?

00:52.620 --> 00:54.155
- Oh.
- Yeah.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.424
- She looks beautiful.
That's obvious.
- Right.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.226
What the pictures
aren't showing you
is the personality,

00:58.326 --> 01:00.294
which is the thing that
I really engaged with.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.529
One of the things
I'm looking forward to later

01:01.629 --> 01:03.397
when I see her
is the conversation.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.999
I mean, she-- she's
smarter than you think.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.601
You know? She reads.
She loves documentaries.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.871
- Oh.
- She likes
intellectual debate.

01:10.971 --> 01:12.540
That's a nice one.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.808
- ( keyboard clicks )
- That's a fun shoot.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.377
Now, wait.
Would she be wearing
a bathing suit

01:16.477 --> 01:18.011
under there
or would she be naked?

01:18.112 --> 01:19.447
I don't want you
thinking about her naked.

01:19.547 --> 01:20.748
Get that image out of
your head straight away.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.183
Okay.

01:23.184 --> 01:26.354
- Is it gone?
- Yes.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.122
Right, look at me.
Look at me.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.458
Is that image
still in your head
of her naked?

01:32.025 --> 01:32.960
- No.
- Why are you
looking down?

01:33.060 --> 01:34.695
I know when you're lying.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.664
You get that image
out of your head
or you're fired.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.266
I can't help it, okay?

01:38.366 --> 01:40.368
Just when I think she's gone,
she just sneaks right back in.

01:40.468 --> 01:44.638
This is unbelievable.
Do your work. Pervert.

01:54.182 --> 01:56.284
( phone chimes )

01:57.185 --> 01:58.352
( chuckles )

01:58.452 --> 02:02.356
I am getting emails
about you 24/7.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.291
Oh?

02:03.391 --> 02:05.826
Getting a lot of buzz.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.562
- I'm so proud.
- Aw.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.934
Wait, hold on.
Let me give us
some privacy.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.170
( laughs )

02:17.505 --> 02:18.839
( laughs )

02:21.275 --> 02:22.443
( groans )

02:22.543 --> 02:24.978
Stuart and his
shitty curtains.

02:25.078 --> 02:26.314
( grunts )

02:26.414 --> 02:28.716
- ( sighs )
- Sexy.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.919
( both laugh )

02:32.019 --> 02:34.255
- ( thuds )
- Ow, fuck!

02:34.355 --> 02:35.956
Shh, you all right?

02:36.056 --> 02:38.659
Oh, jeez.
This place is so small.

02:38.759 --> 02:42.896
It's like a prison cell.
How did I live here
for two years?

02:42.996 --> 02:45.266
Yeah, this place
is a shithole.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.967
I wouldn't let
my dog live here.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.602
Oh.

02:53.641 --> 02:54.842
Glenn!

02:54.942 --> 02:56.677
Glenn, Glenn.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.078
Put her there, player.
Good to see you, man.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.079
Put her there, player.
What up?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.881
Don't-- come on.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.251
Just want to let
you know that even
once she's moved out,

03:03.351 --> 03:04.818
you're always welcome here,
all right?

03:04.918 --> 03:06.754
Just come by anytime.
Think of this as your crib.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.389
- Relax.
- Yeah, just relax.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.057
- Take a load off.
- Take a load off,
go in the pool.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.592
Leave some clothes here,
if you want.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.060
- Oh, that's kind, thanks.
- And a toothbrush.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.795
Um, are you coming out
with us later?

03:14.895 --> 03:16.264
I have a work dinner,

03:16.364 --> 03:17.798
but I'm gonna meet up
with you after, yeah.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.701
Um, did she mention
why we're going out later?

03:20.801 --> 03:22.536
Yeah, her final hurrah.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.505
Well, there's
that reason, but there's--

03:24.605 --> 03:25.973
- Not exactly.
- Yeah, there's another
reason as well,

03:26.073 --> 03:27.641
- which she's aware of.
- Cool.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.443
I'll tell you what it is.
It's that I'm, um--

03:29.543 --> 03:31.111
I'm meeting up
with a chick.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.846
- Good for you.
- Yeah, she's pretty cool.

03:32.946 --> 03:36.550
Pretty cool.
She travels a lot,
internationally.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.885
- Very photogenic.
- She's a model.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.253
- Oh!
- I had to!

03:39.353 --> 03:41.622
I said, "Please
don't mention that,"

03:41.722 --> 03:43.190
- but you mentioned it anyway
'cause he's excited.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.025
- Professional model.
- Ah.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.727
Wait-- I think it's
probably best

03:46.827 --> 03:48.562
you know what she looks like
in case you see me with her

03:48.662 --> 03:50.931
and you're like,
"Oh, uh..."

03:51.031 --> 03:53.033
- Whoa. Good job.
- All right?

03:53.133 --> 03:56.337
Come on, stop showing
off pictures of your
imaginary girlfriend.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.571
Far from imaginary 'cause
there's photos of her.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.773
Nothing has even
happened with her.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.442
What do you mean
nothing's happened?
Nothing's happened yet, no,

04:01.542 --> 04:02.876
but it's only a matter
of time, am I right?

04:02.976 --> 04:05.012
Well, I just spent a week
shooting with LL Cool J.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.814
You don't see me
blabbing about it.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.081
You shot with LL Cool J?

04:08.181 --> 04:09.950
Yes, he is
such a sweetheart.

04:10.050 --> 04:10.951
Oh, hang on.
Bikini shot.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.653
- Whoa.
- Classy.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.221
Oh, you know what?
I should not show
you this one.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.089
- Todd would kill me.
- Who's Todd?

04:16.189 --> 04:19.226
- Oh, Todd is LL.
- Wait, no, LL's--

04:19.327 --> 04:21.795
No, no, no, no, no.
A lot of people think that.
Todd is his real name,

04:21.895 --> 04:23.631
but he doesn't really
like being called Todd
unless you know him.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.032
But why does he always say,
"Hey, I'm LL Cool J?"

04:25.132 --> 04:26.467
Well, because he
kind of...

04:37.311 --> 04:38.712
- Hey!
- Hey.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.681
- Mommy!
- I'll see you later,
sweetie.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.351
- Okay.
- Hey, see you Sunday?

04:43.451 --> 04:45.185
Okay, yeah.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.854
- Uh, Wade.
- Yeah?

04:46.954 --> 04:49.790
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

04:49.890 --> 04:50.991
Yeah, sure.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.726
Good.
I'll see you soon.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.395
Okay.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.910
Wade, you are looking
very sharp this evening.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.545
Well, thank you.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.514
No, you know what?
I just woke up
and I realized,

05:13.614 --> 05:15.616
man, I've been going
about this all wrong.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.386
I mean, I've basically
been begging Marion
for a second chance.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.354
That's gotta make me
look weak.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.423
- So, Stuart,
I'm taking your advice.
- Mm-hmm.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.125
You know, I'm living life.
I'm gonna play it cool.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.628
And I'm just waiting
for her to realize
the mistake she made.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.830
- She's gonna come
crawling back to me.
- Stuart: Good idea.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.600
Oh, Kives, can you
do me a favor and just
check the time for me?

05:32.700 --> 05:33.667
All right.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.436
Hold on a second.
Who is this?

05:35.536 --> 05:37.237
( laughs )
I'll tell you
who that is, mate.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.374
That is the lady
that I am rendezvousing
with this evening.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.775
- Oh, fuck off.
- ( laughs )

05:41.875 --> 05:43.844
Hold on a second.
We-- we know her.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.646
- We met her at the party.
- Yeah, she's really pretty.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.080
Dude, I'm sorry.
It's not gonna happen.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.616
I've known you for,
what, three years?

05:48.716 --> 05:50.618
I cannot remember
the last time that
you've had sex.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.620
( scoffs )
You don't know what
you're talking about.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.221
It's not
about quantity, mate.
It's about quality.

05:54.321 --> 05:55.989
I only may sleep with
one woman a year...

05:56.089 --> 05:58.158
You can guarantee everyone's
talking about her, all right?

05:58.258 --> 06:00.694
Like there was that girl
whose eyes were really
close together.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.130
- Everyone was
talking about her.
- I remember her.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.733
- You don't remember anyone.
- Didn't she have to have
special sunglasses made?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.601
Yes, she had
really weird eyes.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.269
- Amazing body.
- She had weird eyes.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.671
That's what everyone
remembers about her.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.874
And the fact her nickname
was Cyclops Cindy.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.809
( all laugh )

06:17.244 --> 06:18.679
Hey, Glenn.
Stuart.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.781
- Glenn: Mm, Stuart who?
- Stuart Pritchard.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.383
I'm just fucking with you.
I know who you are.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.619
Oh, nice one.
Just wanted to
let you know

06:25.719 --> 06:28.255
that we are popping
in the Federal for about
20 minutes,

06:28.355 --> 06:29.790
then we'll be going
to that club, Elixir.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.892
Very cool.
I'll join you guys
when I can.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.661
Are you talking to Glenn?
Let me talk to him.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.296
- I'm on the phone to him.
- Just stop it. Come on.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.633
Hey, where are you?
I thought you were coming
out with me tonight.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.968
I'm just dealing
with some work shit.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.436
Oh, is everything okay?

06:42.536 --> 06:44.572
Yeah, but it needs
to be sorted out by Monday.

06:44.672 --> 06:48.141
Fine. Just call me
when you're done.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.810
( groans )
Fucking Glenn.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.879
Hey, don't bad-mouth
Glenn, all right?

06:51.979 --> 06:53.280
A, he's a top bloke.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.616
B, he's obviously
working 24/7 for you.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.651
And C, he's clearly
delivering in the bedroom.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.720
Stuart, ew,
you listen to us?

06:59.820 --> 07:01.655
No, I don't
listen to you,

07:01.755 --> 07:03.857
but can I suggest
you close your sliders
once in a while?

07:03.957 --> 07:05.459
'Cause I can barely
hear myself masturbate.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.595
- Ew!
- ( laughs )

07:07.695 --> 07:10.163
Listen, just in case things
get a little bit fruity
later with me and Kimberly,

07:10.263 --> 07:13.233
seriously, has Glenn
got any tips or tricks
that you could give me?

07:13.333 --> 07:14.468
- No, that's weird.
- Foreplay stuff?

07:14.568 --> 07:16.670
- No, ask him yourself.
- Come on.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.639
- I'm not telling you.
- I've tried that, he said
not giving anything away.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.407
Answer me this--
does he ever use a thumb?

07:20.508 --> 07:22.242
St--
( scoffs )

07:22.342 --> 07:24.244
Hello.

07:24.344 --> 07:26.013
Oh, happy birthday.

07:26.113 --> 07:29.382
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
There you go.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.519
Oh, you didn't need
to bring a gift.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.020
Oh, please.
Come on.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.857
Louis Vuitton?

07:40.060 --> 07:41.629
Oh...

07:41.729 --> 07:43.931
this is too generous.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.700
- I can't accept this.
- No, no, no, please.
You have to.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.401
Honestly, I was feeling
a little bit guilty

07:48.502 --> 07:50.437
about booking
that "NCIS" thing.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.172
No, you don't have to
feel guilty about that.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.074
I know, but I do.
I really do.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.609
So I want you to keep that,

07:55.709 --> 07:58.045
and I want you to think of me
every time you use it.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.114
( chuckles )
Okay.

08:01.214 --> 08:04.251
So, Marion's going
to this bowling party tonight
that our friends are having.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.253
I mean, normally,
I would have gone,
you know,

08:06.353 --> 08:07.988
hung around Marion
like a bad smell.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.690
Like that's gonna
change her mind.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.660
But tonight--
not even gonna show up.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.864
Let her wonder
where I am, right?

08:16.964 --> 08:19.533
Wade, can we wrap this up
'cause it's 8:45 and we've
got to get going.

08:19.633 --> 08:23.170
Sorry, I gotta drag
him away 'cause I've got
a date with a model.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.873
Actually, you're at 20%.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.908
I mean, it's only
a 3-bedroom,

08:28.008 --> 08:30.243
but that's great
because then I have
room for an office.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.746
Honestly, I'm just happy
to be getting out of the
guesthouse I'm renting.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.616
Or "outhouse,"
as Amelia calls it.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.484
Oh, I don't think
I called it that.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.152
No, you did,
and you're right.
It's a dump.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.021
- We need to get going.
Come on.
- Oh, okay.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.923
I'm so sorry.
I have to get to
this other party.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.091
Oh.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.593
But you know what?
Let's hang out soon.

08:45.693 --> 08:46.727
Definitely.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.428
It might not be
for a while

08:48.528 --> 08:49.830
'cause life is getting
pretty hectic for me,

08:49.930 --> 08:51.431
but let's definitely
hang out when I can,

08:51.531 --> 08:53.100
- okay?
- Okay.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.169
Good luck with everything.
I'm really rooting for you.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.639
- Bye, ladies.
- Bye.

09:04.945 --> 09:05.846
Hello.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.848
- Hi, there's a line.
- Hi.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.783
I can see that, yeah,
but I'm on the list.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.319
I'm on the list.
Stuart Pritchard?

09:14.187 --> 09:16.289
- You're not on there.
- You barely even
looked at that.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.391
If you're not on the list,
you have to go to
the back of the line.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.559
I'm on the list.
Thank you, madam,

09:19.660 --> 09:21.094
for getting involved.
I appreciate it.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.630
- What list has she got?
- That's the VIP list.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.632
VIP. That's where
I probably am.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.466
Could you just
check the VIP list?
I'm Stuart Pritchard.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.801
You're not on the list.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.502
You didn't even
look at that.

09:29.603 --> 09:30.671
At least he pretended
to have a look.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.305
You're not on any list.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.008
Why don't you do you
and I'll do me?
How about that?

09:35.108 --> 09:37.310
I'll tell you who
put me on the list.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.779
Ba-ding.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.148
Hey, Pritch,
what's the holdup?

09:41.248 --> 09:42.850
It's getting cold out here.
I can't feel my legs.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.418
- I'm dealing with it.
- That a buddy of yours?

09:45.518 --> 09:48.288
That's my best friend...

09:48.388 --> 09:49.723
and he's a war veteran.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.725
- What war was he in?
- "World War Z."

09:51.825 --> 09:55.095
- How did he lose his legs?
- The zombies ate them off
for being nosy.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.597
It's fine. The vet,
one other person.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.733
He's actually got a couple
of other people with him,

09:59.833 --> 10:03.236
his nurse
and his nurse's sister.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.772
Just you and the vet.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.608
What could we
arrange financially

10:08.709 --> 10:10.343
to help them get in?

10:10.443 --> 10:12.279
What are you thinking?

10:12.379 --> 10:14.347
How about seven bucks?

10:14.447 --> 10:16.516
Just give me
$3 back and then--

10:16.616 --> 10:18.451
No.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.487
- Nine. $9.
- $20 each.

10:20.587 --> 10:23.290
$20 each? What are you--
$9, that's--

10:23.390 --> 10:24.658
$20.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.595
- Guys, you're in.
- ( groans )

10:28.696 --> 10:30.864
In you go.
It's 20 bucks
each from you.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.333
- Okay.
- No-- Wade, no.
We're not paying.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.736
For God's sake.
Unbelievable.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.438
40 bucks.
There you go.

10:38.538 --> 10:39.907
- All right.
- Thank you.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.875
Thank you
for your service.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.043
What?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.112
Oh, don't mention that.
He's very modest.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.748
- He doesn't want
to talk about that.
- ( phone chimes )

10:47.848 --> 10:49.082
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.384
- Kimberly's already left.
- What?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.186
Yeah, she's gone to
a party in the Hills.
She says the club's boring.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.422
- What?
- Come on, let's go,
let's go.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.090
- Jessica: Can we
just stay here?
- We're already inside.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.291
We're not already--
can't you-- come on.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.492
- God, Stuart.
- Here you go.

10:59.592 --> 11:00.794
Are you kidding me?

11:00.894 --> 11:03.030
Thanks, mate, but we
don't need to come in.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.398
We've got to go to a party
in the Hills with that model
that I showed you a picture of.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.367
- Can I get the money back?
- Oh, that's not the way
it works.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.302
You went in.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.904
I didn't go in, did I?
I went-- that's in.
In there is in.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.806
I didn't go in.
I walked through a rope.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.541
You went in.
I opened the rope
for you, you went in.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.744
You opened the rope for me.
That's 40 bucks?

11:16.844 --> 11:18.779
- Yeah, that's 40 bucks.
- I don't even need you
to open it for me.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.380
I could've just
stepped over it.
Look at that.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.649
That's got to be a discount,
surely, if I do it myself.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.384
Is there different prices
for different ropes?

11:24.484 --> 11:26.253
How much is this
costing me?

11:26.353 --> 11:27.921
Yeah?

11:28.021 --> 11:29.757
How much am I
spending there?

11:29.857 --> 11:32.459
I'm running up
quite a little tab.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.530
40 bucks is madness!

11:37.630 --> 11:39.066
I don't know what
the rules are.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.001
I don't know
what the rules are.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.073
Jesus Christ, just call her.
Ask her for the address.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.008
I'm not calling her,
all right?

11:48.108 --> 11:49.342
'Cause it'll seem like
I'm desperate to see her.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.044
You are desperate
to see her.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.746
And you're wasting
my night, all right?
This sucks.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.247
Really? Am I?
What would you be
doing instead?

11:54.347 --> 11:57.450
- Your mom.
- ( laughs )
This guy kills me.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.786
Why-- shh.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.120
He's funny.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.955
Okay, can we please
just pull over for a minute?

12:02.055 --> 12:03.957
This is really bad
for the environment.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.126
- Oh, all right.
- Thank you.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.166
( engine stops )

12:17.004 --> 12:18.972
Well, this is way better
than the club.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.809
Jesus, Pritch,
you've got a TV star here.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.010
Yeah, and she doesn't
want to be sitting

12:23.110 --> 12:24.812
on the side of the road
in a shitty BMW.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.213
Kimberly will text me
in a minute,

12:26.313 --> 12:27.680
we'll have the address,
we'll be gone.

12:27.781 --> 12:28.949
Let's just chill out
for a second

12:29.049 --> 12:30.217
and enjoy
each other's company.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.819
Stuart, what if
she never texts you?

12:31.919 --> 12:33.420
She's not worth it.
Let's just go have fun.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.088
- Why are you being negative?
- I'm not being negative.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.890
I was just thinking,
if we're waiting around,

12:36.990 --> 12:39.259
maybe we could swing
by Marion's bowling party.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.928
Wade, I thought
you were playing it cool.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.130
Yeah, I mean, what's cooler
than showing up,

12:43.230 --> 12:46.133
throwing a couple strikes,
and then leaving when
you're in the lead?

12:46.233 --> 12:47.767
- ( phone chimes )
- Oh, look. There we are.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.069
I knew she'd--

12:49.169 --> 12:51.171
- Oh, for--
- ( all laugh )

12:51.271 --> 12:53.640
Pathetic.
You're an adolescent.

12:53.740 --> 12:54.908
Get out of the car.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.210
Oh, come on, guy.
It's a joke.

12:57.310 --> 13:01.181
It's not a joke.
Look, I'm at 6% now.
That is not funny.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.783
( phone chimes )

13:03.884 --> 13:06.019
Ye of little faith.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.188
- I stand corrected.
- Apology accepted.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.490
When you're having sex
with my mother, think
of me with her.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.026
Yeah, I'll call
your mom, make sure
she's okay with that.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.962
Yeah.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.976
( emergency brake ratchets )

13:29.076 --> 13:31.344
Give me the ticket.
See you in there.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.481
Out of the way, lads.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.819
Kimberly?
Oh, sorry.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.454
I thought you were
someone else. Sorry.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.056
Kimberly.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.824
- Oh, you're not a model.
- What?

13:44.925 --> 13:46.359
What'd that guy
just say to me?

13:50.898 --> 13:54.501
You total and utter
fucking prick!

13:54.601 --> 13:56.003
Not you.
Sorry, mate.

13:57.737 --> 14:00.740
Wade, grab me a drink.
I see some girls that
are sitting down.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.809
( phone chimes )

14:02.910 --> 14:04.544
Where the fuck
are you?

14:04.644 --> 14:06.346
Hey, sorry.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.415
I have some bad news.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.918
Are you okay?

14:11.018 --> 14:13.453
"NCIS" is going
in a different direction.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.755
They-- they're
recasting you.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.357
What?

14:17.457 --> 14:19.259
I've been going back
and forth with them all day

14:19.359 --> 14:22.862
trying to change their minds,
but there is nothing I can do.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.698
They're gonna replace you.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.434
Why?

14:29.769 --> 14:31.204
You didn't test well.

14:31.304 --> 14:35.575
The audience didn't,
uh, respond to you.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.679
I'm sorry.

14:39.779 --> 14:42.615
We'll get you
something better.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.551
Thanks for letting me know.

14:57.864 --> 15:00.233
- Everything okay?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.069
She's not here
and my phone's died.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.670
Can I borrow yours,
check my voicemail?

15:03.770 --> 15:05.305
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.275
You know, I was thinking
maybe I should hit
that bowling party.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.776
You know, just check in,
show my face.

15:09.876 --> 15:11.744
Hang on, hang on.
Voicemail.

15:11.844 --> 15:14.147
Kimberly's voice:
Hey, we're going to
a way cooler party.

15:14.247 --> 15:18.018
It's 15350 Malibu Road.
I'll see you there.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.953
We're going to a party
in Malibu, all right?

15:20.053 --> 15:21.989
No, no, we're not
going to Malibu.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.523
I just want to go to this
bowling party, you know?

15:23.623 --> 15:26.193
- Check in with Marion.
- I'm not going bowling.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.295
We've been chasing
this girl all over the city.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.597
I'm not going to Malibu
just 'cause you're hung up
on some bimbo.

15:30.697 --> 15:34.501
All right,
she's not a bimbo, okay?
And what are we gonna do?

15:34.601 --> 15:37.204
We're gonna go to
a bowling alley so you can
stand around near Marion

15:37.304 --> 15:40.473
in the hope that she'll
magically take you back?

15:40.573 --> 15:43.443
I mean, she's asked
for a divorce, Wade.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.013
What, so you just want me
to give up on my marriage?

15:46.113 --> 15:48.515
It's not giving up, man.
You've been trying for months.

15:48.615 --> 15:52.019
But at some point,
I think you just
got to accept it.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.254
You've still got
her picture on your phone.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.923
That's no good.
Every time you answer
you're seeing her and...

15:57.024 --> 16:00.560
I think you've got to delete
that and start getting on
with your life, Wade.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.363
Why would you say that?
You're supposed to
be my friend.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.698
I'm saying it
'cause I am your friend.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.667
You know what?
I gotta go.

16:07.767 --> 16:08.868
Wade, come on, man.
What--

16:08.968 --> 16:10.670
I'll talk
to you tomorrow.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.205
( sighs )

16:14.274 --> 16:15.708
What?

16:15.808 --> 16:18.211
I didn't
say anything.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.214
Okay, can I have your phone?
I need to text Glenn
about the party.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.116
You know what?
I don't think
I'm gonna go.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.852
What?
Tonight's all about you.
You gotta come.

16:25.952 --> 16:27.920
I know, I'm just not
really feeling great.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.956
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.492
Okay, thank you.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.567
Hey, cabs are taking
30 minutes, so...

16:40.667 --> 16:42.602
You can't give
us a ride?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.571
Well, no, 'cause
I'm going in a different
direction, aren't I?

16:44.671 --> 16:46.306
But I would've otherwise.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.241
Yeah, well, I'm just
gonna walk down there
and get a cab, then.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.809
- I'll go with you.
- Yeah?

16:49.909 --> 16:51.811
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I'll see you later.

16:51.911 --> 16:54.047
- Sorry about--
- Yeah, it's okay.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.015
All right.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.184
But hang on, hang on.

16:57.284 --> 16:58.818
How do I look
when I see her?

16:58.918 --> 17:02.255
- You look great.
- Yeah? Breath.

17:02.355 --> 17:05.024
You know what?
Here, take a mint.

17:08.061 --> 17:09.429
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.863
- Yeah? All right, thanks.
- Just keep 'em.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.932
All right.
See you later, bye.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.434
Hi, I'm in a bit
of a hurry.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.303
- What kind of car
do you have, sir?
- BMW.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.872
- What kind of BMW?
SUV, 3 Series?
- 3 Series, yeah.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.674
There's a lot
of 3 Series, sir.

17:21.774 --> 17:22.842
It's the vintage one.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.411
Um, what time
did you come in?

17:24.511 --> 17:26.146
It's the shitty red one.
Can we just get a move on?

17:26.246 --> 17:28.748
- Come on.
- ( speaks Spanish )

17:28.848 --> 17:30.417
Up the hill?
Just-- hang on.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.685
You get it, mate.
Thank you, cheers.

17:37.657 --> 17:40.160
For fuck's sake.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.530
Give me the keys!

17:47.134 --> 17:49.035
Yip! Yip!

17:49.136 --> 17:52.172
- What are you doing?
- I'm scaring off the coyotes.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.243
Yip!

17:57.910 --> 18:01.514
So, do you think
I should go to that
bowling party, see Marion?

18:03.250 --> 18:05.785
Wade, what do you hope
is gonna happen?

18:06.953 --> 18:08.788
Yip!

18:09.889 --> 18:11.558
I don't know.

18:11.658 --> 18:15.928
Maybe that she'll see me
and remember...

18:16.028 --> 18:17.797
what we have.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.666
Yip!

18:21.634 --> 18:24.271
Do you really think
it's gonna work?

18:25.905 --> 18:28.541
What, you agree
with Stuart?

18:28.641 --> 18:30.443
I should just give up
on my marriage?

18:30.543 --> 18:34.881
Well, maybe he didn't
say it right, but...

18:36.249 --> 18:39.419
he is a selfish ass.

18:39.519 --> 18:42.121
I don't know, I think
maybe he might be right.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.393
Sometimes you
have to accept

18:46.493 --> 18:48.428
that some things
just aren't gonna happen

18:48.528 --> 18:51.231
no matter how much
you want it.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.733
( dog howling )

18:53.833 --> 18:57.136
Both:
Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip!
Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip!

18:57.237 --> 19:00.507
- Oh, Pritch!
Pritch, Pritch!
- What?

19:00.607 --> 19:01.908
Jesus, I thought you
were leaving without me.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.877
- I am!
- Wait, what?

19:04.977 --> 19:06.479
Pritch!

19:06.579 --> 19:08.881
Did that asshole
just leave you stranded?

19:08.981 --> 19:10.583
He did.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.486
- Well, how are you
gonna get home?
- Don't know.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.054
Why don't you
hang with us?

19:15.154 --> 19:16.789
We'll give you
a ride when we leave.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.358
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.992
Wow, you're so sweet.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.962
- Come on.
- Thanks.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.631
Okay.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.165
Ready?

19:26.266 --> 19:29.469
( both laugh )

19:31.103 --> 19:33.673
( honking )

19:45.017 --> 19:46.886
( sighs )

19:57.864 --> 20:00.400
- ( thuds )
- Ow!

20:00.500 --> 20:02.235
Fuck.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.780
( sobbing )

20:35.234 --> 20:36.803
( music playing )

20:53.620 --> 20:55.154
( laughing )

20:55.254 --> 20:56.323
Hey.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.826
- Hi, you made it!
- Hey, yeah.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.795
Where have you
been all night?
You've been MIA.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.897
Yeah, I was driving
around looking for you.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.300
Ugh, yeah, but my night
has literally been,

21:07.400 --> 21:09.068
like, a train wreck
from hell.

21:09.168 --> 21:10.937
I was at this club
and these stupid bitches

21:11.037 --> 21:13.373
tried to get me kicked out
'cause I was smoking
a cigarette.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.342
Oh, I hate stupid bitches.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.009
Yeah, right?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.078
Oh, but who the fuck
cares about them?
I don't.

21:19.178 --> 21:22.181
- And you promised me shots.
Where are they, madam?
- I did! Over here.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.116
Let's go.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.986
( ringing )

21:27.086 --> 21:29.088
Glenn on recording:
It's Glenn. You know
what to do.

21:29.188 --> 21:30.723
( beeps )

21:30.823 --> 21:32.325
Hey, it's me.

21:32.425 --> 21:35.562
So, I just decided
to come home.

21:35.662 --> 21:38.064
Um...

21:38.164 --> 21:40.667
I'm just feeling
really shitty

21:40.767 --> 21:44.471
and I don't want
to be alone tonight,

21:44.571 --> 21:47.474
so I was just wondering
if you maybe want to come by.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.743
Okay, bye.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.982
( music playing )

21:56.082 --> 21:58.351
( squeals, laughs )

21:58.451 --> 22:00.353
Here, here, here,
here, here.

22:01.287 --> 22:03.990
( laughs )

22:04.090 --> 22:06.292
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.827
( gasps )
You know what I wanna do?

22:07.927 --> 22:10.096
I wanna go down to the beach.
It'll be totally random.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.698
What, me as well?

22:11.798 --> 22:13.700
- Yeah, silly.
- Oh, all right, yeah, sure.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.034
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Let's go.

22:15.134 --> 22:16.536
Oh, Glenn!
Glenn!

22:16.636 --> 22:17.870
Oh, you've gotta
meet this guy.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.305
Glad you made it, player.
Put it there.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.474
This is an absolute
top geezer.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.476
Hi, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Kimberly.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.244
Nice to meet you.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.613
- I'm gonna go
get some champagne.
- Sure.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.214
Okay.

22:28.314 --> 22:31.250
Chicken Wings.
Nice job, buddy.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.519
Yes, I'm glad
you made it down

22:32.619 --> 22:33.820
so you could
see her in the flesh.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.287
- See you later.
- Dude, Chicken Wings?

22:35.388 --> 22:36.489
Yeah?

22:36.589 --> 22:38.525
If you see Jessica tonight,

22:38.625 --> 22:40.026
will you just do me a solid?

22:40.126 --> 22:41.461
Just don't mention
seeing me here.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.295
She keeps
leaving me messages

22:43.396 --> 22:44.797
and I don't want to
have to go over there
and deal with that tonight.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.232
No, totally, I hear ya.
I hear ya.

22:46.332 --> 22:47.967
- I'm on your side.
- Thanks.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.636
Deal with what?

22:49.736 --> 22:52.805
She was recast on "NCIS,"

22:52.905 --> 22:54.774
which obviously sucks,

22:54.874 --> 22:58.478
but I just don't want
to have to deal with that
on my Friday night.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.213
No, why should you?

23:01.313 --> 23:03.115
- Put her there, player.
- Yeah.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.757
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

23:12.291 --> 23:13.893
- ( pops )
- ( shrieks )

23:21.968 --> 23:23.536
Mm.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.977
Oh.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.879
Oh.

23:41.888 --> 23:44.691
You know what'd be
really, really amazing?

23:44.791 --> 23:45.658
What?

23:45.758 --> 23:48.427
Is if we went
night swimming.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.429
Oh, I didn't bring
my bathing costume.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.398
You don't need one.
It's fine.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.200
Come on.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.874
( laughs )

24:12.885 --> 24:15.021
Come on in!
The water's great!

24:15.121 --> 24:16.589
It's fantastic!

24:16.689 --> 24:18.290
I'm on my way!
I'm on my way!

24:18.390 --> 24:20.893
Come on!

24:42.682 --> 24:44.717
( Kimberly laughs )
Oh, my God.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.186
My nipples
are so hard!

25:04.904 --> 25:06.673
Kimberly!

25:06.773 --> 25:08.708
I think I need
to take off!

25:41.207 --> 25:43.843
Woman on TV:
Yeah, that'll be the day.

25:46.278 --> 25:49.081
( knock on slider )

25:55.021 --> 25:56.589
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:00.359 --> 26:03.462
How'd it go
with Kimberly?

26:03.562 --> 26:06.733
Got all the way to Malibu,
she wasn't there.

26:06.833 --> 26:07.800
Oh.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.936
What's going on here?

26:10.970 --> 26:14.206
They're recasting me
on "NCIS."

26:14.306 --> 26:15.942
Really?

26:16.042 --> 26:17.810
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.412
You wanna
talk about it?

26:20.512 --> 26:22.114
Not really.

26:24.917 --> 26:28.420
Well, I'll tell you what's
happening in the big house.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.389
I'm planning
on watching a film.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.959
Well, what
are you gonna watch?

26:33.059 --> 26:35.327
I don't know.
What about "Con Air"?

26:35.427 --> 26:36.929
( groans )

26:38.831 --> 26:40.667
Can we watch this, please?

26:40.767 --> 26:42.001
Ingmar Bergman?
Seriously?

26:42.101 --> 26:43.435
- He's the best.
- Is he the best?

26:43.535 --> 26:45.304
Yeah.

26:45.404 --> 26:46.605
Okay, come on.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.407
Is there nudity
in this?

26:48.507 --> 26:49.976
Jessica: Yeah,
actually there's a lot
of nudity in that.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.443
Is there?
Now I'm interested.

26:51.543 --> 26:52.779
No, that's not
why you watch--

26:52.879 --> 26:54.714
That's exactly
why you watch it.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.415
No, it's not.
That is one of
Ingmar's best.

26:56.515 --> 26:57.516
One of Ingmar's?
Really?

26:57.616 --> 26:58.785
- First-name terms?
- Yes.

26:58.885 --> 27:00.452
Name three
Ingmar Bergman films.

27:00.552 --> 27:02.454
( scoffs )
That one.

27:02.554 --> 27:03.890
Right, yeah,
of course, yeah.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.992
Um, uh...

27:06.092 --> 27:08.728
the one--
you know, the one where
Death is playing chess.

27:08.828 --> 27:11.864
- Right, "The Seventh Seal."
- Yes, "The Seventh Seal."

27:11.964 --> 27:14.767
There's one
that takes place
in the summer.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.468
Nailed it.
Great job.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.637
Shut up.
Shut up.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.172
- There are several.
- Yeah.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.274
But that one
is my favorite
of all of them.

27:22.374 --> 27:25.244
- You've never seen it.
- I have seen it.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.013
I have seen it
many times.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.781
* That's why
I'm sitting here *

27:28.881 --> 27:31.884
* Looking 'cross
the table at you *

27:42.862 --> 27:47.066
* Well, a lonely man
needs a marriage bureau *

27:49.101 --> 27:53.205
* Where they sit you right down
and you fill in a form *

27:55.174 --> 28:00.579
* Would you like a blonde
or a black or a blue rinse? *

28:00.679 --> 28:05.017
* Do you like 'em small,
love 'em slim, long and tall? *

28:07.019 --> 28:11.323
* Do you like 'em small,
love 'em slim, long and tall? *

28:12.959 --> 28:19.465
* Oh, no,
too many questions *

28:19.565 --> 28:22.201
* I'm looking for a girl
like Momma used to be *

28:22.301 --> 28:26.672
* She's cooking up a dream,
she's baking ecstasy *

28:26.773 --> 28:32.178
* Won't it be fine
when I find her? *
