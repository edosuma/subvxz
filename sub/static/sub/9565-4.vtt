00:05.840 --> 00:06.840
Dad?

00:10.631 --> 00:11.780
I love you.

00:12.320 --> 00:13.599
I felt nothing.

00:13.939 --> 00:16.399
{3}Me and Sketch were
wondering if we could...

00:16.600 --> 00:18.440
{3}- It won't take long.
- It never takes long.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.639
I'm going to surprise him.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.159
She misses you, right?

00:23.360 --> 00:25.639
<i>I think I dumped Cassie.</i>

00:26.475 --> 00:29.160
<i>She's... with some guy.</i>

00:33.880 --> 00:36.319
Michelle had the funny tits
and was like so boring.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.799
I told you I loved you, didn't I?

00:38.040 --> 00:40.359
Do you actually remember
or is that a guess?

00:40.560 --> 00:44.310
Do you remember what it was like
to kiss him for the first time?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.650
That magic moment
when everything changed?

MICHELLE

02:17.480 --> 02:19.319
Hello, Anthea.

02:19.480 --> 02:20.480
Is Tony here?

02:20.600 --> 02:21.600
He is.

02:22.360 --> 02:25.119
So... could I talk to him?

02:25.360 --> 02:27.320
Haven't seen you for
a while, Michelle.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.959
You must have been very busy, yeah?

02:30.976 --> 02:32.360
Anthea...

02:32.480 --> 02:34.679
I'm sorry. It's been difficult.

02:34.920 --> 02:39.120
Yeah, it has.
It's been very, very difficult.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.800
And he's starting to get better

02:40.920 --> 02:42.919
and I don't want anyone
screwing that up,

02:43.160 --> 02:45.940
because they can't
make their mind up, OK?

02:46.720 --> 02:47.720
Mum?

02:50.240 --> 02:52.799
It's rude to keep people
waiting on the doorstep.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.560
How are you feeling?

03:09.680 --> 03:10.680
Good.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.639
I start doing whole days
at college next week.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.747
I can hold a pen
for three pages now

03:15.867 --> 03:17.960
and I can remember the words
to a whole song.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.359
Go on then.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.760
OK. Let me get this. OK.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.720
That's just the chorus.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.280
It's a start.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.120
How much do you actually
remember about us, Tony?

03:51.920 --> 03:53.400
I remember.

03:55.280 --> 03:56.840
So tell me something.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.359
Sid loves you.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.599
No. Sid loves Cassie, Tony.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.439
He loves you.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.600
That isn't about you and me.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.810
I don't like to think about us.

04:13.800 --> 04:14.800
Why not?

04:15.400 --> 04:17.639
They told me some things
might never come back.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.650
You used to say one tit
was bigger than the other.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.610
Look at me, for fuck's sake.

04:43.626 --> 04:44.875
They're fine.

04:49.704 --> 04:50.704
Tony.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.359
What are we going to do?

05:05.480 --> 05:06.643
You can do this, OK?

05:06.763 --> 05:07.763
OK.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.479
- You want it.
- Yeah.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.400
Oh my God!

05:47.520 --> 05:48.599
This is ridiculous!

05:49.278 --> 05:50.320
I'm sorry.

06:02.680 --> 06:06.360
Why can't you get better for me?

06:06.480 --> 06:09.519
We had so much and
it's all fucked up for ever.

06:13.437 --> 06:15.383
It's just the way it is, Nips.

06:18.080 --> 06:22.240
You bastard! What the fuck were
you doing in the road! You idiot!

06:22.360 --> 06:23.959
You fucking idiot!

06:27.401 --> 06:28.799
It's time you went, Michelle.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.519
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I didn't mean it to happen.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.120
No, but it did, didn't it?

06:34.560 --> 06:35.709
So just go.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.670
I'll wait for you downstairs.

06:58.939 --> 07:01.279
I don't think I can
wait any more, Tony.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.560
I got you a present.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.799
It's a birthday present.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.480
For the good times.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.599
I'm going camping for my birthday.

07:22.186 --> 07:25.400
OK, well, I don't want to come,
so... take it.

08:12.780 --> 08:16.620
Those boxes over there. And this
lot over there in the kitchen.

08:20.060 --> 08:21.980
Michelle! Come on.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.980
Yeah.
Why aren't you bringing furniture?

08:25.100 --> 08:27.460
- It's so weird.
- We discussed this.

08:27.580 --> 08:29.380
New start. Clean sheet.

08:29.601 --> 08:31.220
You've known him for two months.

08:31.340 --> 08:34.659
You didn't have to get married
for Christ sakes - again!

08:34.841 --> 08:37.239
Well, fuck it. I did marry him,
Reader. And here we are.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.260
Come on. You'll love it.

08:40.380 --> 08:42.659
Careful with that, it's fragile!

08:44.940 --> 08:46.239
Fuckin' bi...

08:47.340 --> 08:48.780
Where is everything?

08:48.900 --> 08:51.380
It's minimal. Functional.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.660
- Modern.
- Yes.

08:52.780 --> 08:53.900
Bit wanky.

08:54.020 --> 08:58.700
Yes... No! Christ! You don't have to
be negative just for the sake of it.

08:58.820 --> 09:01.300
It's totally state of the art.

09:01.420 --> 09:02.769
Check this out.

09:04.175 --> 09:05.508
Blinds up.

09:13.678 --> 09:14.760
Lights on.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.160
Music on.

09:21.260 --> 09:24.420
Marvellous. We'll never
have to use our hands again.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.100
It's empty.

09:38.321 --> 09:40.100
Ted hates mess.

09:40.220 --> 09:41.999
- No shit.
- Chelle!

09:42.161 --> 09:44.540
Well, this is exactly
the kind of place you hate.

09:44.660 --> 09:48.140
Totally up itself. Over designed,
self conscious, anal...

09:48.260 --> 09:50.580
Who designed this
bollocks for him, anyway?

09:50.700 --> 09:53.940
Some kind of knobby
interior designer...

09:54.161 --> 09:55.842
It was you, wasn't it?

09:55.962 --> 09:57.740
You can be so judgmental.

09:57.860 --> 09:59.500
Oh, my God.

09:59.620 --> 10:03.780
It's a shag pad. You designed him
a shag pad and shagged him in it.

10:03.900 --> 10:07.060
It wasn't like that.
Well, it was a bit like that.

10:07.241 --> 10:09.839
Must have been the way he
went through my swatches.

10:11.340 --> 10:12.489
Look, love.

10:13.818 --> 10:15.260
He's the one.

10:15.380 --> 10:18.580
We've got a future
and I'm gonna go for it.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.279
Just wish your future
started after I'd left home.

10:21.441 --> 10:23.140
A few subtle changes
here and there,

10:23.260 --> 10:26.260
a touch of colour,
and we'll be fine.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.100
Door open.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.553
Second bedroom, yeah?

10:32.673 --> 10:34.466
Yeah. This one's mine.

10:40.081 --> 10:41.860
Buggerin' hell!

10:45.841 --> 10:48.300
This one's
actually a lemon squeezer.

10:48.521 --> 10:49.860
Thank Christ for that.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.580
Fuck me senseless.

11:26.361 --> 11:27.940
Hey. What's it like?

11:28.161 --> 11:30.060
A fucking nightmare, of course!

11:30.180 --> 11:33.940
All there is, is sheep,
sheep shit and my mum.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.260
I'm not having such a hot time
myself.

11:36.481 --> 11:38.660
Can't you come down and help?

11:38.780 --> 11:40.700
I don't know how to get out of here.

11:40.820 --> 11:43.100
It's fucking miles.
What are you doing?

11:43.220 --> 11:44.420
Babysitting.

11:44.601 --> 11:46.700
We're still going camping
for my birthday?

11:46.820 --> 11:49.159
I'm not sure you wanna
share a tent with these guys.

11:49.321 --> 11:51.820
Anyway, stay cool, yeah?

11:56.529 --> 11:58.295
Right. Where were we?

11:58.820 --> 12:00.340
Michelle's annoyed with you.

12:00.460 --> 12:03.119
Yeah, my willy's gone wonky
and I'm a little bit mad.

12:03.281 --> 12:05.820
OK. Anwar's acting weird...

12:06.001 --> 12:07.060
Totally, man.

12:07.180 --> 12:10.399
If I didn't know better I would
say he was fucking someone secretly.

12:10.561 --> 12:11.500
No way.

12:11.721 --> 12:12.980
It's not possible.

12:13.687 --> 12:14.800
OK...

12:15.140 --> 12:18.060
And you went to Scotland to
see Cassie and she wasn't there

12:18.180 --> 12:21.520
and you think she's off shagging
some Scottish guy named Lachlan.

12:22.236 --> 12:23.279
And my dad's dead.

12:23.441 --> 12:24.460
Bummer.

12:24.681 --> 12:25.799
Sorry about that.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.900
Chris - got anything to offer?

12:32.420 --> 12:33.580
Bubbles.

12:34.140 --> 12:36.088
They go up and up,

12:37.110 --> 12:38.004
and up.

12:38.124 --> 12:39.652
And then...

12:40.778 --> 12:42.018
they disappear.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.260
Poof!

12:46.700 --> 12:47.860
Chelle!

12:51.540 --> 12:52.540
Chelle!

12:53.460 --> 12:55.220
I need help with lunch!

12:57.100 --> 12:58.220
Chelle!

13:00.380 --> 13:01.340
CHELLE!

13:20.900 --> 13:22.220
Blinds up.

13:24.580 --> 13:25.900
Blinds up!

13:32.100 --> 13:33.100
Music?

13:36.372 --> 13:38.100
Music, better?

13:41.123 --> 13:42.165
OK...

13:43.500 --> 13:45.719
Blinds, go fuck yourselves!

14:05.660 --> 14:07.980
Oh, hi, Michelle! Everything OK?

14:08.644 --> 14:09.752
Fuck!

14:10.521 --> 14:13.500
Blinds! Blinds... close!

14:13.620 --> 14:16.060
Blinds down! Close! Blinds!

14:17.601 --> 14:19.439
Aaargh! Close blinds!

14:22.980 --> 14:23.919
Help!

14:45.700 --> 14:47.249
Oh, perfect!

14:48.300 --> 14:49.368
Yum-yum!

14:52.397 --> 14:53.446
This is...

14:54.580 --> 14:56.320
- This is lovely, Ted.
- Isn't it?

14:57.300 --> 14:59.620
You know, that was a moment for me

14:59.740 --> 15:02.580
when you said you loved
yellow fin tuna. Oh, yeah.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.300
I say to myself, any girl that loves
Mies van der Rohe furniture,

15:07.481 --> 15:10.780
Corbusier and tuna sashimi
has got to be right for me.

15:10.900 --> 15:12.620
Oh, Ted, you're so sweet.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.380
You know,

15:17.500 --> 15:20.780
Mum's last husband Malcolm
said something very similar.

15:21.001 --> 15:21.860
Oh?

15:21.980 --> 15:23.140
Oh, yeah...

15:23.260 --> 15:25.100
Actually, I'm getting that wrong.

15:25.220 --> 15:26.549
Darling, no need to...

15:26.669 --> 15:29.660
He just said he liked your big
fat arse, didn't he?

15:29.780 --> 15:31.820
Oh! Oh, fuck!

15:32.001 --> 15:33.519
Oh, shit!

15:35.580 --> 15:37.260
Darling, allow me.

15:39.540 --> 15:42.319
Lovely! Oh, nice and salty.

15:44.239 --> 15:47.180
I thought we could go christen
the er, the tub later.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.300
The tub?

15:48.481 --> 15:51.060
Mmm. New toy. Very social, fresh air,

15:51.180 --> 15:55.740
couple of Creamy Dream cocktails,
hot tub, what could be better?

15:55.860 --> 15:57.399
Erm, I'm not sure.

15:57.561 --> 16:00.220
You know, we're all gonna be so happy
together. Right?

16:00.340 --> 16:01.399
Right.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.400
Hello. Ted Rankles...

16:08.620 --> 16:10.100
Oh, yes...

16:10.220 --> 16:12.177
Hey, gorgeous plums!

16:12.769 --> 16:13.760
What?

16:13.921 --> 16:14.921
What?!

16:15.500 --> 16:17.120
A cheese omelette?

16:17.939 --> 16:19.862
She made it with margarine?

16:20.401 --> 16:22.660
Yeah, of course, trans-fats.

16:22.841 --> 16:24.860
Yeah. Of course you can, come over.

16:24.980 --> 16:25.980
Ted!

16:26.100 --> 16:28.180
Yeah. OK, sweetheart.

16:28.300 --> 16:29.740
Yeah, take her car.

16:29.860 --> 16:32.380
I fucking pay for it after all. Yeah!

16:32.500 --> 16:33.800
OK, yeah, see you soon.

16:40.220 --> 16:41.220
Who was that?

16:41.340 --> 16:42.759
Scarlett, my daughter.

16:43.367 --> 16:44.940
Your daughter?

16:45.060 --> 16:46.719
Yes.
Darling, I was going to tell you.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.980
Scarlett lives with
her mum in Henley and...

16:50.100 --> 16:51.959
You know, Diane can be such a bitch.

16:52.121 --> 16:53.470
Poor old Plums.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.140
She'll be here in an hour.

16:57.260 --> 16:59.879
- Another cracked nipple, anyone?
- Er, yes!

17:02.020 --> 17:03.839
Haven't quite
got the hang of this yet.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.660
You didn't tell me...

17:08.780 --> 17:11.460
I'd forgotten.
Anyway, I didn't think she'd...

17:11.579 --> 17:13.199
Gorgeous Plums?! Oh, yeah.

17:13.361 --> 17:15.319
Bugger. I keep doing that!

17:21.679 --> 17:23.579
Ah. That must be her!

17:23.700 --> 17:24.940
Here she is!

17:25.160 --> 17:27.718
He-he-hey! Teddy Bear!

17:27.990 --> 17:29.878
My Teddy Bear!

17:31.300 --> 17:35.100
She is such a titless,
jealous bitch, that's what she is!

17:35.220 --> 17:37.660
What did you ever see
in that saggy old bint?

17:37.780 --> 17:39.399
You can't talk about her like that.

17:39.561 --> 17:42.300
- That's what you always call her.
- Not sure that I do.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.279
You said that she was
a menopausal old hag

17:44.441 --> 17:47.220
and they'd have to stockpile
HRT for like a decade and...

17:47.340 --> 17:48.420
Oh, they're here.

17:48.540 --> 17:50.863
Yes. Remember I told you,
they're moving in today.

17:50.983 --> 17:51.983
Do they have to?

17:52.103 --> 17:54.620
Yes, love. We discussed this.
Now you know Anna...

17:54.740 --> 17:56.266
Nice to see you again, Scarlett.

17:57.140 --> 17:58.540
And this is Michelle.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.639
- Mee-chelle?
- It's Michelle, actually.

18:00.801 --> 18:04.180
Whatever. Daddy, you can't
make me live with her any more.

18:04.512 --> 18:06.531
Oh, Munchkin!

18:07.361 --> 18:09.800
Erm, perhaps
we should talk about it?

18:09.960 --> 18:12.119
- I'm sure your Mum...
- She doesn't want me here!

18:12.281 --> 18:14.079
I do! I do. It's just that...

18:14.241 --> 18:17.639
Anyway. I've decided to take another
year out before going to uni.

18:17.800 --> 18:18.700
Right.

18:18.820 --> 18:20.599
I won't waste it.
I'm gonna do stuff.

18:20.761 --> 18:23.900
I thought I might take an evening
class in Chinese or something.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.860
I mean they're all Chinese now,
aren't they?

18:27.280 --> 18:30.199
And you always said
that tu casa was my casa.

18:30.361 --> 18:33.279
Well, of course you can
stay here, sweetheart.

18:33.441 --> 18:35.620
It's not like you'd put
me out on the streets.

18:35.740 --> 18:36.860
No, Bunny.

18:36.980 --> 18:39.020
Thank you, Daddykins, I love you.

18:39.140 --> 18:40.879
I love you, too, Possum Poo.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.140
I'm going to my room.

18:55.940 --> 18:59.119
Dad! Someone's put their stuff
in my fucking room!

19:07.100 --> 19:10.479
She won't be here long.
Well, not that long.

19:11.082 --> 19:12.651
A few weeks.

19:13.260 --> 19:15.300
We're not entirely sure, but...

19:15.420 --> 19:16.359
Mum...

19:16.620 --> 19:17.980
I'm sorry.

19:20.700 --> 19:23.820
I promise we'll do something
great for your birthday, yeah?

19:23.940 --> 19:27.250
It's OK.
Jal says we can go camping, maybe.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.460
Least I'll be out of the way.

19:29.580 --> 19:31.354
Oh, darling, you're not in the way.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.520
It's hard to be out of
the way of those tits.

19:33.940 --> 19:34.912
Stop it.

19:36.060 --> 19:38.260
Some pair of bazookas, eh?

19:41.020 --> 19:43.060
I love you, Bunnyflaps!

19:43.241 --> 19:46.180
I love you too, lardy buns!

19:49.321 --> 19:50.470
Tub anyone?

19:51.521 --> 19:53.780
It's totally heated by solar power.

19:53.961 --> 19:57.060
12,000 litres of heaven, 15 settings.

19:57.880 --> 19:58.929
Whirlpool,

20:00.704 --> 20:02.563
uprush, and...

20:03.240 --> 20:04.700
Vesuvio...

20:06.986 --> 20:08.310
Let's give it a go!

20:10.780 --> 20:12.620
No need to be shy, darling.

20:12.801 --> 20:14.199
I mean, we're all family now!

20:20.266 --> 20:21.315
Wonderful.

20:22.915 --> 20:24.060
Hey, Cheeky!

20:25.394 --> 20:26.439
Chelle!

20:29.100 --> 20:30.319
Wonderful!

20:34.121 --> 20:35.599
Come on in, it's lovely!

20:36.239 --> 20:37.888
Hey, where's Michelle?

20:38.960 --> 20:40.719
Poor old Plum's stuck here with us
oldies,

20:40.940 --> 20:43.980
why don't you get her to take
her to meet some of her friends?

20:44.100 --> 20:48.239
They'll love Scarlett.
Everybody loves Scarlett.

20:52.220 --> 20:53.860
I've been doing some courses.

20:53.980 --> 20:56.592
Er, dog walking,
Cordon Bleu barbecue,

20:57.015 --> 20:59.320
intermediate eroticism...

20:59.481 --> 21:01.420
And the rest of the time
I just sewed.

21:01.540 --> 21:04.380
I made this, erm,
this pair of shorts, actually.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.940
They're a lovely pair.

21:07.121 --> 21:09.220
Really lovely pair.

21:09.686 --> 21:10.780
Lovely.

21:11.961 --> 21:15.020
Anyway, we still going camping?

21:17.400 --> 21:18.919
- Sid!?
- Yeah?

21:19.598 --> 21:21.520
Jal wants us all to go camping.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.719
- For my birthday?
- It was only a suggestion.

21:24.174 --> 21:25.300
I can't.

21:25.420 --> 21:27.020
- I'm going to be...
- What?

21:27.621 --> 21:30.053
Nothing, erm. Hey, Max!

21:30.660 --> 21:33.240
- You all right, mate?
- Fine. Fine.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.060
I'm really fine as in, whoa!

21:36.180 --> 21:37.340
Fine.

21:37.521 --> 21:38.839
OK...

21:39.860 --> 21:42.020
Max, this is Scarlett.

21:45.016 --> 21:46.016
Hi!

21:47.679 --> 21:49.900
What do you think about camping,
Max?

21:50.020 --> 21:52.140
Well, if guys wanna do it,
it's their business.

21:52.260 --> 21:55.639
Personally, I like a more butch look.

22:01.347 --> 22:03.929
Thing is, you know, erm,
coursework...

22:05.520 --> 22:06.520
Skint.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.820
Chris?

22:09.001 --> 22:10.895
- Nipples.
- What?

22:11.881 --> 22:14.620
Thanks for the enthusiasm, everyone.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.258
Camping's wicked!

22:16.378 --> 22:17.359
Camp fires,

22:17.521 --> 22:20.260
a few spliffs,
booze, alfresco sex.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.759
What could be better? We should go!

22:22.921 --> 22:24.700
Hang on, "we"?

22:24.881 --> 22:27.340
Spliffs, booze and alfresco sex!

22:27.954 --> 22:29.420
What is that?

22:29.540 --> 22:32.420
Shagging under the stars.
There's nothing like it.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.460
I'm in. Erm...

22:35.580 --> 22:36.879
We haven't got a car and...

22:37.041 --> 22:38.759
I have an enormous Volvo.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.300
I think that swings it.

22:43.481 --> 22:44.840
So that's Monday everyone.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.560
Monday! Final coursework deadline
and if you miss it,

22:47.720 --> 22:49.620
you'll be fucked.
Got that, Chris?

22:49.740 --> 22:50.900
Fucked. Got it, Sal.

22:51.020 --> 22:53.660
No, I mean it everybody!
Don't let me down.

22:53.780 --> 22:55.559
Are you listening to...?

23:00.980 --> 23:03.580
Barrie? Yeah. I'm ovulating.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.519
Meet me in the stationery cupboard?

23:05.681 --> 23:07.420
No, I mean it. It's now or never.

23:07.540 --> 23:09.719
What's up? We're going camping, OK?

23:09.881 --> 23:12.799
I didn't invite Scarlett Bitch
and you're all gagging over her.

23:12.961 --> 23:15.780
She... She seems really nice.

23:15.900 --> 23:19.420
She's a cow.
I don't want her coming.

23:19.540 --> 23:21.520
She's just... Just...

23:22.660 --> 23:26.879
Michelle, we're gonna go camping
and we're going to be nice. OK?

24:01.841 --> 24:03.759
For fuck's sake, Sid!

24:03.921 --> 24:05.919
Sorry. I dropped the spliff again.

24:07.220 --> 24:08.920
See, the problem with beach sex

24:09.080 --> 24:11.137
- is sand on the nads.
- Think I see it.

24:11.257 --> 24:12.999
Sweaty nads plus sand
equals chafing.

24:13.161 --> 24:15.940
- You've got sweaty nads?
- Me...? No.

24:16.060 --> 24:18.340
No. Sand just rolls off 'em
like talcum powder

24:18.460 --> 24:21.679
due to my exceptionally smooth,
thus, self-draining bollocks.

24:21.860 --> 24:24.399
Fuck's sake. We've already had
three bifters.

24:24.561 --> 24:25.980
Leave it down there.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.759
Nah, find it, man!

24:27.921 --> 24:31.439
We've lost all feeling below the
knees back here. It's like torture!

24:31.601 --> 24:32.660
Yeah.

24:34.241 --> 24:35.959
No, hang on. Yeah.

24:37.700 --> 24:40.540
Why didn't Tony wanna come?

24:40.660 --> 24:42.820
Said he didn't feel like it.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.399
That's it? That's all he said?

24:45.580 --> 24:48.260
There's no room in the car,
is there?

24:48.680 --> 24:50.079
No. Here we go...

24:50.518 --> 24:51.518
Hang on.

24:54.340 --> 24:57.940
You're so gross! You're disgusting!

24:58.060 --> 25:00.680
That's your birthday present,'Chelle!

25:04.361 --> 25:05.719
Oh, you tramp!

25:12.700 --> 25:14.260
Seriously, guys.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.679
What did you all get me
for my birthday?

25:52.740 --> 25:54.740
Me and my friends always come here.

25:54.860 --> 25:56.839
That's wicked, man!

25:57.740 --> 25:58.959
What do you think, Meesh?

25:59.121 --> 26:02.119
It's fucking Michelle, all right?

26:03.886 --> 26:04.886
OK.

26:05.580 --> 26:07.940
People usually like my nicknames.
Don't they, Spunky?

26:08.060 --> 26:10.260
Spunky... love it.

26:10.441 --> 26:11.580
Oh, for fuck's sake!

26:11.700 --> 26:13.380
What's my nickname, Scarlett?

26:13.500 --> 26:14.559
Knobless.

26:14.721 --> 26:17.860
This is beautiful, man.
Just like Baywatch.

26:19.201 --> 26:21.039
Right then! First things first.

26:21.201 --> 26:22.820
Skinny dipping.

26:22.940 --> 26:24.700
Skinny dipping?

26:24.820 --> 26:25.820
Yeah!

26:26.401 --> 26:29.460
Come on there's only us here. What
are you guys, a bunch of pussies?

26:29.580 --> 26:30.599
I'm not.

26:31.955 --> 26:32.955
Coolio.

26:33.345 --> 26:34.759
I'll race you.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.380
Never seen one like that before.

26:47.860 --> 26:49.740
Oh, my God, Anwar!
You really did it.

26:49.860 --> 26:50.780
What?

26:50.961 --> 26:53.460
Wearing all my clothes.

26:53.580 --> 26:56.980
It's compact. Saves on the luggage.
I got ya!

26:57.161 --> 26:59.479
Anwar, have you been shaving stuff?

27:03.540 --> 27:06.329
Allah Akbar!

27:08.580 --> 27:09.619
Let's go!

27:11.220 --> 27:12.460
Allah Akbar!

28:15.613 --> 28:16.662
All right?

28:34.761 --> 28:36.700
Jal says you went to see Tony.

28:36.820 --> 28:38.439
It's over, Sid.

28:38.601 --> 28:40.020
I tried...

28:40.201 --> 28:41.700
I can't...

28:44.140 --> 28:46.090
It just doesn't work any more.

28:47.700 --> 28:49.176
I'm not a good enough person.

28:49.296 --> 28:51.799
- That's all there is to it.
- Hey. You're good enough.

28:56.601 --> 28:58.060
Ugh... she does my head in.

28:58.180 --> 29:00.420
Just got to get to know her a bit.

29:01.251 --> 29:02.920
- She's fun.
- And I'm not?

29:03.820 --> 29:04.820
Always.

29:10.233 --> 29:11.382
You OK, Sid?

29:12.380 --> 29:13.759
Sometimes.

29:14.496 --> 29:16.209
I keep forgetting Dad's...

29:20.601 --> 29:24.599
Anyways. We should get the tents up.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.940
Gimme a hand getting them off the...

29:28.060 --> 29:29.180
Roof...

29:29.360 --> 29:32.239
- It's not my fault!
- I told you to tie the tents to the roof!

29:32.420 --> 29:34.719
You said to put the stuff
on the roof, not tie it.

29:34.881 --> 29:35.943
You meader, Chris!

29:36.063 --> 29:37.842
What do you think was holding
them up there, you muppet?

29:37.962 --> 29:40.210
- Where the fuck are we gonna sleep?
- I'm sorry!

29:41.736 --> 29:43.399
Fuck it. I'm inadequate.
What can you do?

29:43.561 --> 29:44.561
This.

29:47.721 --> 29:49.479
That has gotta hurt!

29:49.641 --> 29:51.639
It's OK. I put mine in the boot.

29:54.180 --> 29:56.980
Might be a bit of a squeeze,
but we can probably manage.

29:57.100 --> 29:59.399
All you have to do is peg it down.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.900
Yo, Scarlett!

30:06.980 --> 30:10.660
I got it when I went travelling,
my dad bought it for me.

30:10.780 --> 30:12.340
We love your Dad!

30:32.660 --> 30:35.340
Pull yourself together, girl,
for fuck's sakes.

30:55.250 --> 30:56.780
What you got?

30:57.341 --> 30:59.300
I don't know.

30:59.420 --> 31:02.020
I'll save it for later.

31:07.820 --> 31:09.279
What's wrong with me?

31:12.359 --> 31:13.359
How long you got?

31:20.361 --> 31:22.540
You think we're all gonna fit in?

31:22.660 --> 31:24.460
We're gonna have to squeeze up.

31:24.580 --> 31:26.460
Real close. Eh, Scarlett?

31:26.580 --> 31:28.130
It's going to be warm.

31:30.380 --> 31:31.380
Get off!

31:32.664 --> 31:34.540
- Hang on.
- What is it?

31:34.660 --> 31:36.238
Does the sea sound louder?

31:38.140 --> 31:39.580
Oh, my God!

31:51.700 --> 31:53.396
Oh my God, my car!

32:01.060 --> 32:04.279
Wher are the keys!
Oh, my God, where's the keys!

32:05.420 --> 32:06.420
Nice.

32:29.312 --> 32:30.312
Anwar?

32:31.209 --> 32:32.479
Who the fuck's that?

32:42.161 --> 32:43.839
That's your stalker, Maxxie.

32:45.700 --> 32:47.239
Hello, Maxxie.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.999
- What are you doing?
- Listen...

32:52.160 --> 32:54.400
- She broke into my flat!
- Then she tried to poison me!

32:55.081 --> 32:56.740
I can probably explain.

32:56.860 --> 32:58.912
You'll just need to
give me a minute.

33:00.160 --> 33:02.300
What else can I say? I like her.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.443
- She's a fucking bunny boiler!
- She's all right.

33:04.563 --> 33:06.559
She's a freak.
And you call yourself a friend?

33:06.720 --> 33:08.900
- I am!
- How could you do this?

33:09.020 --> 33:10.620
I was going to tell you.

33:10.740 --> 33:14.300
Max, if only you could
see how much she's changed.

33:14.420 --> 33:17.359
I've changed.
I've transferred my affections...

33:17.521 --> 33:20.060
She's transferred
her affections, man.

33:20.180 --> 33:22.719
Now she's fixated on me.

33:22.881 --> 33:24.599
Isn't that great?

33:25.347 --> 33:26.896
You lied to me, An!

33:28.080 --> 33:32.580
I know... Look, will somebody
help me out here? Make him see...

33:32.700 --> 33:35.199
You shouldn't lie, Anwar.
Not to Max.

33:35.361 --> 33:37.500
I'm sorry, Maxxie.

33:37.620 --> 33:40.220
I was going through some stuff.

33:40.841 --> 33:43.020
I know that's not an excuse.

33:43.140 --> 33:45.380
You too, Michelle.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.959
I was a bit ga-ga.
And I'm sorry, I really am.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.709
I know that now.

33:51.580 --> 33:52.719
Please. Everyone...

33:54.340 --> 33:56.239
Please forgive me.

34:03.039 --> 34:04.039
Whatever.

34:11.580 --> 34:13.900
Well, I don't know about
any of this, but I think

34:14.020 --> 34:15.400
we got to lift this mood yeah?

34:15.560 --> 34:17.440
Chris, did you get that guitar
out of the car

34:17.600 --> 34:19.998
before it got so fucked up
my Dad will string me up?

34:20.161 --> 34:21.759
Yeah... It's OK, I think.

34:27.041 --> 34:28.558
Let's give it a go.

34:28.719 --> 34:30.918
Oh, please, no...

35:08.020 --> 35:10.559
Yeah! Brilliant! And again! Again!

35:12.500 --> 35:14.519
I love a bit of Bedingfield!

35:52.054 --> 35:53.503
Ignore him, Anwar.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.440
He's just jealous
of our burning love.

36:39.920 --> 36:42.440
There's something about your eyes.

36:42.739 --> 36:45.040
Yeah,
the right one's always been lazy.

36:45.160 --> 36:47.120
No, I mean they're lovely.

36:49.881 --> 36:51.628
I thought that the moment I met you.

36:51.748 --> 36:54.880
Surprising, really, given that
they were burning a hole in my bra.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.080
Sorry... I didn't mean to... Sorry.

36:58.440 --> 37:01.000
I don't mind. You can look.

37:01.120 --> 37:03.139
You can do more than look
if you want.

37:03.259 --> 37:04.560
Oh. Right.

37:05.120 --> 37:06.727
Um... Are you...?

37:06.847 --> 37:08.493
Yes, I am.

37:09.356 --> 37:10.356
OK...

37:13.680 --> 37:16.240
I'm not really after, you know...

37:16.360 --> 37:17.560
Thanks.

37:17.960 --> 37:21.520
Um... actually,
I'm in a weird place and, um...

37:21.680 --> 37:26.160
Well, I've got to, er...
I was just playing with you.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.560
Everyone loves my tits.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.560
I was just having a laugh.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.640
Yeah, whatever.
Seemed like he fancied me.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.880
Or he would with a little push.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.440
Sid's not like most guys.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.120
Yeah, I know, that's why I've...

37:56.240 --> 37:57.560
Maybe he doesn't like you.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.560
Oh, not possible.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.880
He was telling me about his dad.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.400
He's so cute.

38:07.760 --> 38:09.720
His dad is dead.

38:09.840 --> 38:13.960
He's probably a bit vulnerable,
you know. I know. Shit!

38:18.920 --> 38:22.760
He says that you're the only one
that knows how to talk to him.

38:23.920 --> 38:28.360
He said that? Because you've
known each other forever.

38:28.521 --> 38:31.920
And sometimes he thinks that
he knows you better than you do.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.040
And that's when I decided
to show him my tits.

38:34.160 --> 38:35.760
I'm a bitch.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.750
Go on. You can probably catch him.

38:44.360 --> 38:48.360
Even I can tell he needs a hug,
and I'm the insensitive cow.

38:49.494 --> 38:50.494
OK.

38:51.777 --> 38:53.040
Thanks.

38:59.353 --> 39:00.960
You're not a bitch. Are you?

39:02.840 --> 39:04.520
Just pretending.

39:24.888 --> 39:25.888
Sid!

40:06.788 --> 40:07.868
Chelle.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.400
I'm so lonely.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.280
I know.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.085
I know.

41:04.360 --> 41:05.640
Oh, Christ.

41:18.080 --> 41:19.730
Happy Birthday, Chelle.

43:21.960 --> 43:23.680
Can we go home now, Sid?

43:23.800 --> 43:26.560
Yes, Chelle. Let's go home.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.320
Yeah, cheers. Bye.

43:38.311 --> 43:40.161
Dunno what I'm supposed to say.

43:40.424 --> 43:41.729
You just...

43:43.480 --> 43:45.360
I suppose we didn't...

43:45.480 --> 43:46.480
I dunno.

43:47.160 --> 43:48.800
Pretend like we didn't...

43:50.560 --> 43:53.480
Um... Help me out here, Chelle.

43:53.600 --> 43:54.920
Ask me inside, Sid.

43:56.200 --> 43:57.080
What?

43:58.440 --> 44:00.120
Wasn't that the best night ever?

44:00.520 --> 44:03.240
I'm not drawing on a wealth
of experience here, Chelle.

44:05.160 --> 44:09.400
You made me come, Sid.
Nobody's ever done that before.

44:11.120 --> 44:13.640
Nah! Let's go inside.

44:24.520 --> 44:25.823
Happy birthday.

44:26.680 --> 44:27.680
Thanks.

44:36.819 --> 44:38.280
We have to ring Tony.

44:38.640 --> 44:41.640
We have to tell him.
Yeah, but not now, yeah?

44:41.960 --> 44:43.760
We can wait a couple of hours maybe?

44:45.263 --> 44:46.840
I can't believe this.

44:48.320 --> 44:49.320
Go up.

44:56.968 --> 44:59.215
- I'm back, Mum.
- OK, Sid!

44:59.335 --> 45:01.480
I'm going to bed.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.440
- With Michelle!
- Right-o.

45:03.560 --> 45:05.400
- To sleep with her.
- Yep.

45:05.520 --> 45:06.572
Again!

45:12.600 --> 45:15.720
I want you to do it again,
just like you did. Come on.

45:36.040 --> 45:37.189
Hello, Sid.

45:37.902 --> 45:39.251
Hello, Michelle.

45:55.880 --> 45:57.440
Are you saying I'm being expelled?

45:57.600 --> 45:59.640
I prefer the term "no longer
permanently affiliated".

45:59.960 --> 46:01.480
That's right.

46:01.600 --> 46:04.120
For the first time in my life it
felt like someone gave a shit!

46:04.280 --> 46:05.280
Have you ever been in love?

46:08.160 --> 46:11.400
So this place is great for doing LSD.
Hello.

46:14.489 --> 46:16.039
I fucked up big time.

46:17.305 --> 46:23.167
