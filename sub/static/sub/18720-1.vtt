01:22.182 --> 01:26.151
<i>For we meet in an hour
of change and challenge,</i>

01:26.153 --> 01:29.121
<i>in a decade of hope and fear,</i>

01:29.123 --> 01:32.424
<i>in an age of both
knowledge and ignorance.</i>

01:32.426 --> 01:37.563
<i>The greater our knowledge increases,
the greater our ignorance unfolds.</i>

01:37.565 --> 01:40.666
<i>So it is not surprising</i>

01:40.668 --> 01:44.603
<i>that some would have us stay
where we are a little longer.</i>

01:44.605 --> 01:47.206
<i>To rest, to wait.</i>

01:47.208 --> 01:51.176
<i>But this city of Houston,
this state of Texas,</i>

01:51.178 --> 01:53.278
<i>this country of
the United States</i>

01:53.280 --> 01:56.181
<i>was not built by those
who waited and rested</i>

01:56.183 --> 01:58.117
<i>and wished to look behind them.</i>

02:02.622 --> 02:05.124
<i>We choose to go to the moon.</i>

02:05.126 --> 02:07.326
<i>We choose to go to the moon.</i>

02:12.866 --> 02:17.569
<i>We choose to go to the moon in this
decade and do the other things,</i>

02:17.571 --> 02:21.673
<i>not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.</i>

02:21.675 --> 02:26.211
<i>With this one speech, John f.
Kennedy escalated our cold war</i>

02:26.213 --> 02:29.281
<i>with the Soviet union
to outer space.</i>

02:29.283 --> 02:32.751
<i>Now, if we do not land a man
on the moon by 1969,</i>

02:32.753 --> 02:35.320
<i>we will have broken
jfk's promise.</i>

02:35.322 --> 02:39.291
<i>And in the eyes of the world, the
Soviet union will win the cold war.</i>

02:39.293 --> 02:41.226
<i>To make matters
even more difficult,</i>

02:41.228 --> 02:42.828
<i>the CIA has discovered a leak</i>

02:42.830 --> 02:45.264
<i>coming out of the space program.</i>

02:45.266 --> 02:48.267
<i>Top secret American research is
showing up in Soviet briefings,</i>

02:48.269 --> 02:53.572
<i>which means the kgb has
implanted a mole inside NASA.</i>

02:53.574 --> 02:58.410
<i>If the Russians are able to steal our
technology, they could beat us to the moon.</i>

02:58.412 --> 03:04.249
<i>Just as they beat us into space
with the sputnik satellite in 1957.</i>

03:04.251 --> 03:07.486
<i>The director of NASA, James webb,
denies the presence of this mole,</i>

03:07.488 --> 03:10.956
<i>which means the CIA must
move in a team undercover.</i>

03:11.958 --> 03:14.693
<i>That's where we come in.</i>

03:14.695 --> 03:17.663
<i>Allow me to introduce
Owen Williams,</i>

03:17.665 --> 03:20.532
<i>and myself, Matt Johnson.</i>

03:20.534 --> 03:22.868
<i>We joined the CIA through
the bright recruits program</i>

03:22.870 --> 03:26.305
<i>and have been working
together ever since.</i>

03:26.307 --> 03:31.343
<i>Along with our camera team, we
make up the CIA's av department.</i>

03:31.345 --> 03:34.446
<i>Currently, we are finishing
operation deep red.</i>

03:34.448 --> 03:36.748
<i>The probe into film director
Stanley kubrick.</i>

03:36.750 --> 03:40.719
<i>But this mission is not using
us to our full potential.</i>

03:40.721 --> 03:43.956
<i>We are asking to be transferred
off of operation deep red,</i>

03:43.958 --> 03:46.458
<i>and on to operation zipper.</i>

03:46.460 --> 03:48.827
<i>The mission into NASA
to find the mole.</i>

03:48.829 --> 03:51.597
<i>Because of our filmmaking
background, we would make...</i>

03:51.599 --> 03:52.965
Okay, stop.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.833
Stop.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.301
What is this supposed to be?

03:56.303 --> 03:59.471
Okay. It's a...
It's a pitch film.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.874
It... so... it's for operation zipper.
I think...

04:02.876 --> 04:05.277
Operation zipper's already
been assigned.

04:05.279 --> 04:06.578
We know it has.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.580
I think the agency is
making a mistake

04:08.582 --> 04:10.716
with sending
a scientist into NASA.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.318
Well, your opinion
means nothing.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.454
Yeah, okay.
Just... just...

04:15.456 --> 04:17.522
If you watch the rest of this film,
you'll see... I've seen enough.

04:17.524 --> 04:20.625
But we have an amazing plan for
finding the spy. I'm sure you do.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.829
Boles, we worked hard on this. You're seriously
not going to watch the rest of this?

04:23.831 --> 04:25.497
No. Can we show it to brackett?

04:25.499 --> 04:26.598
No.

04:29.535 --> 04:32.404
Okay.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.373
This was a long shot.

04:34.375 --> 04:37.009
We've only been here
for one year.

04:37.011 --> 04:39.511
We'll get on missions
like this in the future.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.416
I thought this was
going to work.

04:44.418 --> 04:48.320
You knew that it wasn't a great chance.
Yeah, you should...

04:48.322 --> 04:49.755
Jared, you should have cut when

04:49.757 --> 04:51.290
you saw it wasn't going good.

04:51.292 --> 04:53.025
You're supposed to be
filming so that...

04:53.027 --> 04:55.861
I didn't even notice.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.829
Yeah.
Hey.

05:02.435 --> 05:04.903
Okay, I got an idea.

05:04.905 --> 05:08.573
<i>We need to send someone who will look
like they have no idea what's going on.</i>

05:08.575 --> 05:11.576
<i>Us, as a documentary film crew.</i>

05:11.578 --> 05:14.813
We can pretend we are from the national
education... Okay, we have to go.

05:14.815 --> 05:15.914
We got to go.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.350
Is this a good idea?

05:18.352 --> 05:20.752
Andy? It's a good... Hey.
It's a good idea.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.655
Are you ready?
What if they fire us?

05:23.657 --> 05:25.991
What's your first line?

05:25.993 --> 05:29.728
Oh, uh, your plan is to send...
Okay, I'm fine.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.664
Okay. Let's go.

05:43.042 --> 05:44.843
Everyone here?

05:44.845 --> 05:46.511
Boles...

05:46.513 --> 05:48.413
Carry on.
Thank you.

05:48.415 --> 05:50.382
Good morning, everyone.

05:54.822 --> 05:58.857
<i>Hello, my name is special agent Matt
Johnson, and what you're about to watch</i>

05:58.859 --> 06:01.593
<i>is a film detailing the connections
between Stanley kubrick</i>

06:01.595 --> 06:05.530
<i>and the film</i> Dr. strangelove or how I
learned to stop worrying and love the bomb.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.500
<i>Conclusion,
Stanley kubrick is not a spy.</i>

06:15.442 --> 06:17.843
Thank you.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.778
Are there any questions?

06:23.516 --> 06:25.817
That covers it.
Uh, what's next?

06:25.819 --> 06:29.988
Actually, director brackett,
I'd like to make a pitch for

06:29.990 --> 06:34.459
major research to be moved
onto operation zipper next.

06:34.461 --> 06:36.628
What the hell are you doing?

06:38.931 --> 06:41.867
You guys are trying to put a...

06:41.869 --> 06:45.804
Field agent inside NASA
posing as a scientist, and...

06:45.806 --> 06:49.074
Agent Williams and i
don't think it will work.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.777
This mole, if he's there,

06:51.779 --> 06:54.913
could have been at NASA
since the early 60s.

06:54.915 --> 06:59.684
He's going to spot one of our guys pretending
to be a rocket scientist instantly.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.686
We need to send people

07:01.688 --> 07:04.423
who are going to look like they
have no idea what's going on.

07:04.425 --> 07:05.690
Us.

07:05.692 --> 07:07.726
As a documentary film crew.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.462
We can pretend that we're from the
national education television network,

07:10.464 --> 07:13.498
filming the definitive
Apollo documentary.

07:13.500 --> 07:17.068
We're there to chart the race to the moon.
Smart idea.

07:17.070 --> 07:21.440
But no Soviet mole's gonna
let anyone openly film 'em.

07:21.442 --> 07:24.943
Well, director brackett, we're filming
you right now through the window.

07:34.554 --> 07:38.690
You're going to have to buy
us better cameras, though.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.692
Jesus Christ.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.538
Okay, here we go.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.673
Let's hope they buy this.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.142
Ready?

09:04.144 --> 09:07.045
Whoa!

09:07.047 --> 09:08.947
- Hi!
- Hi!

09:08.949 --> 09:10.549
Just let us get our stuff.

09:10.551 --> 09:11.783
Yeah, yeah!

09:12.952 --> 09:14.553
You need help, Andy?

09:14.555 --> 09:16.187
Do you mind if we film this?

09:16.189 --> 09:17.923
Yeah, why not.

09:17.925 --> 09:21.326
Here, at the end
of the hall on the right...

09:21.328 --> 09:22.961
Oh, man.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.930
That's mission control?

09:24.932 --> 09:27.032
Yeah, actually. We'll have
to get in there later.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.133
Hmm.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.701
Hi.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.303
We're a documentary film crew.

09:31.305 --> 09:33.238
We're a documentary film crew.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.574
Jared, make sure you're getting
this crisp and in focus,

09:35.576 --> 09:39.144
I don't want to have to edit
together out of focus stuff, please.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.645
- Sorry.
- No problem.

09:40.647 --> 09:42.047
Your office is just right here.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.815
Okay, here you go.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.352
Wow!

09:47.354 --> 09:49.988
You guys don't need
anything else?

09:49.990 --> 09:51.723
No, uh, we'll come find you if we do.
We'll just get set up.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.158
Thanks, Sharon.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.226
Bye!

09:55.228 --> 09:57.662
She bought it. We're a
documentary film crew.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.965
You see how they look at us? See
how they look in the cameras?

09:59.967 --> 10:02.033
Yeah.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.202
This is the best mission I've
ever been on in my life.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.971
This is, uh...
This is Matt.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.073
Mike.
Nice to meet you.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.175
And, uh, this is Jared.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.978
They're filming a documentary about
the, uh... The Apollo mission.

10:14.313 --> 10:16.314
Oh, okay!

10:16.316 --> 10:19.851
So, we basically are asking
about what you do, and... Sure!

10:19.853 --> 10:21.987
And... and I'm ready.
Yeah. Okay.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.122
Well, I work here
in the public affairs office,

10:24.124 --> 10:26.191
and one of my duties is

10:26.193 --> 10:29.828
the media products,
specifically still photos.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.269
...and I stood up in the theater
in sugar land and I said,

10:38.271 --> 10:42.073
"don't eat those meatballs!
He did not wash his hands."

10:42.075 --> 10:43.208
I had to...

10:51.751 --> 10:54.653
I appreciate your time. Before we launch
to the moon, come back and see us, okay?

10:54.655 --> 10:56.154
I will.
Okay.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.023
Thanks, guys. That's a wrap.
We got it.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.091
All right, and mark it.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.027
- Milt interview.
- Take one.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.397
Thanks, Owen.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.999
So, I guess you can start
just by telling us your name.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.868
Milt heflin.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.704
And what is it you do
here at NASA?

11:12.706 --> 11:14.673
Huh. Uh...

11:15.675 --> 11:17.242
Okay.

11:20.746 --> 11:22.380
Shut the door.

11:34.894 --> 11:38.063
Guys, can we get a shot of
just the lounge being busy?

11:38.065 --> 11:40.331
I know you're all working,
but if you want to just...

11:40.333 --> 11:43.301
Busy, like there's
some activity.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.237
Or, do whatever feels natural.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.473
And action.

11:48.475 --> 11:52.243
No, don't look at the cameras. Just
keep sitting. Just keep standing there.

12:08.294 --> 12:11.262
<i>Part of sato's controversial
south-east Asia...</i>

12:11.264 --> 12:13.431
<i>...the north vietnamese</i>

12:13.433 --> 12:15.834
<i>...decides to accept
us offers...</i>

12:15.836 --> 12:19.304
<i>...spread over 600 feet to
become a gigantic pool of flames</i>

12:19.306 --> 12:24.109
<i>...a fire extinguisher called purple k,
three tragic fires aboard aircraft...</i>

12:24.111 --> 12:27.212
<i>One second, Mr. webb.
We're good?</i>

12:27.214 --> 12:29.748
<i>Mr. webb, tell me,
what does it mean</i>

12:29.750 --> 12:32.417
<i>when people say the Russians are
ahead of us in the space race?</i>

12:32.419 --> 12:35.053
<i>Well, I think it means
that the job of</i>

12:35.055 --> 12:36.955
<i>landing something on the moon</i>

12:36.957 --> 12:38.857
<i>where there's no atmosphere,</i>

12:38.859 --> 12:40.925
<i>and using a rocket
to slow it up,</i>

12:40.927 --> 12:42.393
<i>and having the equipment
still work</i>

12:42.395 --> 12:44.863
<i>is a very difficult job.</i>

12:44.865 --> 12:48.166
<i>Uh, I think it means the Russians
are trying, just like we are...</i>

12:49.135 --> 12:51.436
Where's this guy's office?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.304
<i>...but I think the real
meaning is...</i>

12:57.276 --> 13:02.213
Two more pieces.

13:02.215 --> 13:05.383
- Come on, Jared.
- Got it, got it!

13:05.385 --> 13:07.318
Okay, hold on.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.920
I'm fine, I need light.

13:17.029 --> 13:19.164
Ready?

13:19.166 --> 13:22.167
Test, test, test, test...

13:22.169 --> 13:25.436
<i>...then you get to talk about
how to go forward. To do it.</i>

13:25.438 --> 13:28.206
<i>Uh, I am not much interested,</i>

13:28.208 --> 13:32.076
<i>and I don't think it's very realistic to
talk about technological interchange,</i>

13:32.078 --> 13:34.946
<i>and this kind of thing. You
first gotta get on the basis</i>

13:34.948 --> 13:36.114
<i>where... where...</i>

13:36.116 --> 13:37.582
Okay, so...

13:37.584 --> 13:39.884
His phone rings, in his office,

13:39.886 --> 13:41.920
and this phone rings
at the same time.

13:42.922 --> 13:45.089
As long as we're rolling

13:45.091 --> 13:48.159
when he picks up,
we get everything.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.461
<i>I found us a house.
It's beautiful, it's red,</i>

13:50.463 --> 13:53.031
<i>it has a nursery and a yard.
You'll love it.</i>

13:53.033 --> 13:54.933
<i>How big is the bed?</i>

13:54.935 --> 13:56.167
<i>It's a queen.</i>

13:57.303 --> 14:02.106
<i>Are you alone right now?</i>

14:02.108 --> 14:04.576
<i>No, I'm at work.
What are you doing?</i>

14:04.578 --> 14:07.212
<i>Do you want to know
what I'm wearing?</i>

14:07.214 --> 14:09.480
<i>Julie, I can't do this right now.
I'm at the office.</i>

14:09.482 --> 14:12.183
<i>I'm sorry, maybe later.</i>

14:12.185 --> 14:17.255
<i>Well, I'm wearing a pink bra and
that black skirt you bought me.</i>

14:17.257 --> 14:21.025
<i>Honey, Matt is right beside me and
I'm at work. Can I call you tonight?</i>

14:21.027 --> 14:23.394
<i>I'm taking off the skirt now.</i>

14:25.165 --> 14:27.365
<i>There's nothing underneath.
Whoa!</i>

14:29.102 --> 14:31.302
What are you doing?
Nothing.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.972
<i>I'm trying to have fun with you.</i>

14:33.974 --> 14:36.641
Wait a second, hold on... No!

14:36.643 --> 14:38.443
<i>What is it?</i>

14:38.445 --> 14:40.979
We're not doing anything.
I'm doing work.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.249
<i>Hello?</i>

14:44.251 --> 14:47.585
Don't do that.

14:47.587 --> 14:50.655
What'd you find in that phone?

14:50.657 --> 14:53.258
What? What?
Oh, my god.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.460
We've been bugged.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.395
We've been bugged, guys.
We've been bugged.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.596
No, no, no!

14:58.598 --> 15:01.299
Anything else,
or is that it? Owen?

15:02.268 --> 15:04.435
That's it from this car?

15:04.437 --> 15:07.238
Guys?

15:07.240 --> 15:12.343
I said I was sorry!

15:12.345 --> 15:14.078
Your hat?

15:24.390 --> 15:27.992
- A couple more boxes here.
- These are not a big deal.

15:32.398 --> 15:36.200
Please don't touch me.

15:36.202 --> 15:39.604
I'll get the rest!

16:10.135 --> 16:14.172
<i>We both, uh, have had and
will have emergencies,</i>

16:14.174 --> 16:18.376
<i>and, uh, that each flight, uh, has
some element of extreme risk,</i>

16:18.378 --> 16:20.411
<i>and some elements of...</i>

16:20.413 --> 16:22.680
<i>I made this statement on
my own, from my knowledge,</i>

16:22.682 --> 16:26.150
<i>uh, longstanding knowledge...</i>

16:48.274 --> 16:50.008
<i>...setting us back
four years...</i>

16:50.010 --> 16:51.676
<i>Well...</i>

16:51.678 --> 16:54.078
Uh...

16:54.080 --> 16:56.547
<i>...300 second burn
to the lunar surface...</i>

16:57.549 --> 16:59.550
This is nothing.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.252
Give it a second. <i>250
seconds is all we can do?</i>

17:01.254 --> 17:03.221
<i>That's the maximum.</i>

17:03.223 --> 17:05.723
<i>- And you know that...
- Did you talk to trw?</i>

17:05.724 --> 17:08.425
- Who's the other voice?
- I dunno.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.228
<i>...their fuels.</i>

17:10.230 --> 17:11.796
<i>Grumman has fucked us.</i>

17:11.798 --> 17:15.366
<i>They built a lander
that can't land.</i>

17:15.367 --> 17:17.568
<i>So, we are going back...</i>

17:17.569 --> 17:19.069
<i>With whom?</i>

17:19.071 --> 17:21.071
<i>This is setting us
back four years.</i>

17:21.074 --> 17:24.242
<i>Well, I agree. This is
going to have to change.</i>

17:24.243 --> 17:26.344
<i>Change? We can't
land on the moon.</i>

17:26.346 --> 17:29.380
<i>Unless by some miracle
braun finds lighter fuel,</i>

17:29.382 --> 17:31.582
<i>we aren't touching down
for five years.</i>

17:31.584 --> 17:34.685
<i>Okay... We're just going to
be circling forever up there.</i>

17:34.687 --> 17:36.788
<i>So what are we telling everyone?</i>

17:36.790 --> 17:38.523
<i>- Nothing.
- We don't tell anyone...</i>

17:40.093 --> 17:41.826
Do you understand
what this means?

17:41.828 --> 17:44.195
NASA can't do it.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.064
They can't land man
and come back.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.498
Have you called brackett?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.534
Of course not! I needed
to tell you guys first.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.436
We have to tell brackett. We have
to tell brackett right away.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.337
This is something you report right away.
We need help.

17:53.339 --> 17:56.407
We have to...
Relax, it's okay. Yes. Yes.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.775
And we need... I'll tell
you what to do, okay?

17:57.777 --> 17:59.477
I'm gonna tell you what to do.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.412
Find out who that other guy on
the phone was, okay?

18:01.414 --> 18:03.481
Because, if we found
this out in a month,

18:03.483 --> 18:06.117
you better fucking believe that
the mole can do the same thing.

18:06.119 --> 18:08.186
And now all of a sudden the Russians
know we can't make it to the moon,

18:08.188 --> 18:09.754
then what the fuck are
we going to do?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.756
Okay. Okay. Okay.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.559
You call Langley.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.227
It's ringing.

18:18.164 --> 18:21.599
You think I'll get to talk
to the president? No.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.768
That's not unrealistic.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.470
I could. He could be like, "we need
to get this right to the president."

18:25.472 --> 18:27.271
I'll be like, "all right.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.706
"Give me his
home phone, sir. I'll..."

18:30.310 --> 18:32.276
<i>Hello?</i>

18:32.278 --> 18:33.678
Director brackett, it's agent
Johnson calling from Houston.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.113
We have big news.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.814
<i>What's that?</i>

18:36.816 --> 18:39.150
They can't make it to the moon.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.718
We intercepted a call

18:40.720 --> 18:43.221
from Jim webb.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.756
From what I understand,
they can circle the moon,

18:45.758 --> 18:47.558
but they can't actually land.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.727
They... they don't have
the technology to do it.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.163
They're saying 1971
at the earliest.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.866
<i>Damn it.</i>

18:54.868 --> 18:58.336
<i>Give me a minute.</i>

18:58.338 --> 19:00.505
<i>Okay, who else knows about this?</i>

19:00.507 --> 19:02.540
Uh, nobody, from...
From...

19:02.542 --> 19:03.841
From what we can tell.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.177
They're talking about it
on the phone

19:06.179 --> 19:08.913
like it was a big secret. Like they've
never talked about it before.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.282
<i>Okay, good.</i>

19:11.284 --> 19:13.451
<i>Another unit is going
to take over zipper.</i>

19:13.453 --> 19:15.186
<i>Get your team out of there.</i>

19:15.188 --> 19:18.723
Uh... you think maybe
that's a bit, uh,

19:18.725 --> 19:20.725
shortsighted in a way?

19:20.727 --> 19:23.461
Seeing as we're here undercover now?
What... why?

19:23.463 --> 19:26.397
<i>Don't question my orders, kid.</i>

19:26.399 --> 19:28.399
I'm not... I don't mean
to question it. I...

19:28.401 --> 19:31.669
I just... I simply think
that we're here

19:31.671 --> 19:35.239
and I... We have to figure
out a response to this,

19:35.241 --> 19:37.675
somehow, and you've got us...

19:42.314 --> 19:43.915
We're going home.

21:50.809 --> 21:54.078
If either of us are talking, shoot. I
don't care how much film you burn,

21:54.080 --> 21:55.913
it doesn't matter.
Okay? It's going to save us.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.381
What are we doing in here?

21:57.383 --> 21:58.749
Sit down, just listen
to this, okay?

21:58.751 --> 22:00.584
Well...

22:00.586 --> 22:03.387
Hold on a sec... Did you
call brackett last night?

22:03.389 --> 22:04.922
Yes, all right?
What did he say?

22:04.924 --> 22:06.957
Okay, turn this on.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.327
What did they say?

22:09.329 --> 22:11.662
I'm gonna tell you
what they said.

22:13.899 --> 22:15.566
Okay, it's on.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.436
Okay, you hear that?

22:18.438 --> 22:21.972
Yeah.

22:21.974 --> 22:25.109
- You recognize it?
- Yeah.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.844
It's sputnik.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.512
You know what?
You're ahead of me.

22:28.514 --> 22:29.847
Okay, yeah.
It's sputnik.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.782
How do you know it's sputnik?

22:31.784 --> 22:34.719
Can you... did you
sleep here last night?

22:34.721 --> 22:38.055
That's not plugged
into anything.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.624
It's... it's just a dial on the other side.
It's not actually sputnik.

22:40.626 --> 22:42.059
It's just making
you think that it is.

22:42.061 --> 22:44.028
It's just a random beeping.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.896
And because you think that
that's supposed to be sputnik,

22:45.898 --> 22:47.531
that's why you believe
it's sputnik.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.868
This is what we are
going to do with the moon.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.403
I called brackett,

22:52.405 --> 22:55.072
told him that they
can't make it for '69.

22:55.074 --> 22:58.142
He said, "okay, well, you've got
to figure out a way to fix it."

22:58.144 --> 23:01.679
And I said, "we can
do it on our own.

23:01.681 --> 23:05.616
"We can make a film that
shows us going to the moon

23:05.618 --> 23:07.852
"without actually doing it."

23:09.621 --> 23:11.722
We know that
they can make it up there.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.425
We're not... we're faking
the last little piece.

23:14.427 --> 23:17.061
The tiny... The tiny
thing they can't do.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.596
Land and come back.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.398
The thing jfk said we'd do.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.932
That's the only part.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.435
Everything else is real,
do you understand?

23:24.437 --> 23:25.836
Yeah, I understand
what you're saying.

23:25.838 --> 23:27.104
And I understand
that it sounds like...

23:27.106 --> 23:28.672
Read this, it's from brackett.

23:28.674 --> 23:30.574
He sent a briefing?
Yes.

23:36.948 --> 23:38.983
If we can pull this off,

23:38.985 --> 23:42.086
we are going to look
like geniuses.

23:42.088 --> 23:45.656
Four guys inside of NASA
figure out how to

23:45.658 --> 23:47.858
make it look like we went to the moon.
We did it.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.960
That's crazy!

23:49.962 --> 23:52.530
This is exactly what
we've been waiting for.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.598
It literally fell on our lap.

23:56.535 --> 24:00.471
We could run our own department
after something like this.

24:42.714 --> 24:45.049
Is there
more information coming?

24:45.051 --> 24:47.585
About what?

24:47.587 --> 24:50.688
Well, the objectives
and the budget.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.923
Why?

24:52.925 --> 24:55.092
This doesn't seem
incomplete to you?

24:55.094 --> 24:57.761
Incomplete? How?
What do you mean?

24:57.763 --> 24:59.697
Well, I...
Okay...

24:59.699 --> 25:01.732
You know what, don't...
Don't worry about this.

25:01.734 --> 25:04.635
They obviously told us exactly
what they want us to hear,

25:04.637 --> 25:07.137
so our job is to film a
test, and that's it.

25:08.840 --> 25:12.109
Come on.

25:12.111 --> 25:17.081
Does it... you don't have an
ethical problem with this at all?

25:17.083 --> 25:19.783
In what way?

25:19.785 --> 25:22.620
In that this is lying.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.755
You know what, this is like
one of those good lies.

25:24.757 --> 25:26.924
Like Santa claus
and the easter bunny.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.093
A lot of kids get really
mad about those.

25:32.965 --> 25:35.566
So we're shooting this
at 48 frames a second,

25:35.568 --> 25:37.601
so you're going to
have to move like...

25:37.603 --> 25:39.303
Like you're being lifted up...

25:39.305 --> 25:41.872
Okay? Like this... This thing
weighs about 100 pounds.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.707
Well, just try it.
Try leaping a bit.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.142
Like this.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.618
Yeah, good.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.053
Go! Action! Action!

25:59.090 --> 26:01.125
More that way.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.660
More towards me a bit.

26:02.662 --> 26:04.562
Walk off that way.

26:04.564 --> 26:06.931
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.966
Stop.

26:13.171 --> 26:15.172
We should be
doing this at night.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.308
Can, can the light move a
little bit to the left?

26:17.310 --> 26:19.043
I'm being devoured
and I'm cookin'.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.111
No, that's too far.
That's too far.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.247
Back over this way.
Back to your right.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.616
It doesn't matter...
Stop! Stop!

26:25.618 --> 26:27.851
Okay, now a bit to your left.

26:27.853 --> 26:29.620
How much does
the light drop off?

26:29.622 --> 26:31.822
Are you not getting
destroyed by mosquitoes?

26:31.824 --> 26:34.158
Okay, I am, but I'm trying
to get this right. Hold on.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.060
What else is in the frame?

26:36.062 --> 26:38.629
Uh, I see some logs
in the background.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.831
Yeah, I see it, too.
Okay, I'm getting it.

26:43.068 --> 26:45.669
That's what you're...

26:45.671 --> 26:48.272
Please, let's just roll.
It's fine, it's fine.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.140
It's not a log, it's a rock!

26:50.142 --> 26:52.276
It's okay, we'll frame it out.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.144
I'm going to use it!

26:54.146 --> 26:56.013
I'm going to put it
in the frame.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.915
Are you ready?

26:57.917 --> 26:59.950
And action!

27:03.088 --> 27:05.155
Owen, jump in the air.

27:05.157 --> 27:06.757
Holy shit.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.259
It's open!

27:11.029 --> 27:13.631
Hey.
You're just in time.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.199
Have a seat. So...

27:15.201 --> 27:17.768
The moon footage...
I won't say how it looks.

27:17.770 --> 27:20.771
I just want you to watch it, okay?
Turn the lights off.

27:21.941 --> 27:24.742
So it may seem a bit different.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.644
I think you'll enjoy it.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.890
This is the year
before we got recruited.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.191
Wow.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.704
Who is it?

27:53.706 --> 27:55.072
Hello?

27:57.108 --> 28:00.878
Director brackett,
this is a... uh, come on in.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.450
Welcome.

28:08.953 --> 28:11.689
It's great to see you guys.
This is a surprise.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.891
What the hell is going on?

28:13.893 --> 28:16.994
You're changing the direction on this
project without my authorization?

28:16.996 --> 28:19.697
Okay...
Shut up. I'm not finished.

28:19.699 --> 28:20.998
Okay, now listen...
I'm shutting this operation...

28:21.000 --> 28:22.066
Wait!
Bring it down. It's over.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.434
You made this up?

28:27.005 --> 28:29.840
Okay, yes.
I made up a mission.

28:29.842 --> 28:33.143
But that's because I wanted to make sure
it would work before I brought it to you.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.112
I think i may have solved

28:35.114 --> 28:36.880
the moon problem.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.083
Just... trust me.
Watch this.

28:40.285 --> 28:42.252
Sorry.

28:42.254 --> 28:46.023
Ignore this. Ignore this.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.148
So that's just sand.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.483
William's in the suit.

29:12.485 --> 29:14.284
We shot it in slow motion.

29:18.189 --> 29:20.290
You understand?

29:20.292 --> 29:24.394
I'm saying we could fake the moon
landing, and it wouldn't be hard.

29:25.830 --> 29:27.164
All people want to see

29:27.166 --> 29:28.999
is an image
on a television screen

29:29.001 --> 29:30.534
and we can give them that.

29:30.536 --> 29:32.169
The rocket will go up,

29:32.171 --> 29:34.004
we'll send our
footage with them,

29:34.006 --> 29:36.273
and the astronauts will
just beam it back to earth.

29:36.275 --> 29:40.110
No one is going to think this is fake,
because how insane would that be?

29:40.112 --> 29:41.512
And if we do it right,

29:41.514 --> 29:44.314
this is the kind of thing
that sells itself.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.416
Walter cronkite is going
to do half the work for us.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.421
Let me try.

29:54.192 --> 29:56.293
Give us a minute.

30:19.951 --> 30:22.052
It's okay.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.924
Hi.

30:29.494 --> 30:30.561
Whoa!

30:41.873 --> 30:44.107
Okay, just shoot
from down there, okay?

30:44.109 --> 30:46.176
Owen?

30:46.178 --> 30:48.512
Put... put your mic on.
No.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.981
Put your mic on. Put your... It'll
take two seconds. Put your mic on.

30:50.983 --> 30:54.051
Come on. It'll take two seconds.
I'm not doing this, okay?

30:55.453 --> 30:57.554
Get the fuck off.
Cheer up!

30:57.556 --> 31:00.090
We just got a huge
promotion, come on!

31:02.193 --> 31:03.627
Whoo!

31:09.567 --> 31:12.903
Mr. boles, I guess we'll
be working together again.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.538
Welcome to Texas.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.074
Congratulations on having brackett
approve this insane mission.

31:18.443 --> 31:20.277
You guys are filming
this right now?

31:20.279 --> 31:22.279
Yeah, we film everything.
It's a documentary.

31:22.281 --> 31:25.148
It's a documentary film.

31:25.150 --> 31:28.418
Okay, before we get started on this,
I know you're technically my boss,

31:28.420 --> 31:30.320
but I'm running all this.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.222
Yeah.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.224
No, I'm here because you have
no idea what you're doing.

31:34.226 --> 31:38.128
So I'm in charge and you
don't run a goddamn thing.

31:41.299 --> 31:44.401
So no more fucking around
behind our backs, all right?

31:52.477 --> 31:55.078
Wow, I heard it's pretty shitty.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.114
Hi.
How you doing?

31:57.116 --> 31:58.682
Enjoying the 4th of July?

31:58.684 --> 32:00.951
Yes, I'm in a great mood.

32:00.953 --> 32:04.254
This is a bit of a party for me,
too, because we got a promotion.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.056
Did you?
Yeah.

32:07.992 --> 32:09.927
Somebody just
tell me what's wrong.

32:09.929 --> 32:12.129
Is that...
That's the barbecue.

32:14.966 --> 32:18.068
The barbecue what? What happened
at the barbecue? What's going on?

32:18.070 --> 32:19.536
Watch.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.338
Right...

32:22.273 --> 32:24.107
There. See that?

32:24.109 --> 32:26.944
Yeah, two guys.
Yeah. Look at this.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.282
So he's holding something,
we're thinking maybe super 8.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.284
It could be a 35mm still camera.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.988
And do we know who this is?
Maybe they're NASA guests.

32:37.990 --> 32:40.324
Yeah, I don't know.
Tourists? Who knows, right?

32:42.161 --> 32:43.727
It could be nothing.

32:43.729 --> 32:46.096
It is nothing...

32:46.098 --> 32:47.497
Who is it?

32:47.499 --> 32:49.232
It's boles.

32:57.442 --> 32:58.976
This looks like shit.

33:00.179 --> 33:03.347
You have one guy
in a space suit,

33:03.349 --> 33:05.182
prancing around on the sand...

33:05.184 --> 33:07.150
...with one rock.

33:07.152 --> 33:08.352
Who do you think
this is gonna convince?

33:08.354 --> 33:10.253
I...
It convinced brackett.

33:10.255 --> 33:12.522
Well, now you have
to convince me.

33:12.524 --> 33:13.690
What are you talking about?

33:13.692 --> 33:15.292
Nobody is going to buy this.

33:15.294 --> 33:17.594
I thought you were advocating
for me to do this!

33:17.596 --> 33:20.230
I was advocating
for operation northwoods.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.032
I think this idea's ridiculous.

33:34.113 --> 33:37.314
Mike, do you remember
mentioning, uh, test locations

33:37.316 --> 33:39.716
that NASA was using
for photography?

33:39.718 --> 33:41.451
Would you mind
showing me those pictures?

33:41.453 --> 33:42.652
You mean on camera, or...

33:42.654 --> 33:44.488
If you don't mind.
I don't mind.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.690
These are places that look
like the moon on earth?

33:46.692 --> 33:51.294
Exactly. These are called
geology field trips.

33:51.296 --> 33:53.430
So you're saying that the
rocks that are on the moon

33:53.432 --> 33:55.365
are the exact same
as the rocks on earth?

33:55.367 --> 33:57.401
I'm not saying exact. I'm saying...
But they're close?

33:57.403 --> 33:59.770
They're close enough that...
That...

33:59.772 --> 34:02.372
Yeah, I mean... So if you saw
them, you would think that, uh...

34:02.374 --> 34:04.574
Oh, yeah, you can
get an igneous rock

34:04.576 --> 34:06.777
from a volcano here in America

34:06.779 --> 34:08.277
and tell somebody
it's a moon rock

34:08.280 --> 34:09.679
and they wouldn't know.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.313
Really?
Yeah.

34:20.425 --> 34:22.826
- Hello.
- Is Owen home?

34:22.828 --> 34:25.195
He's in the garage.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.530
You look great.

34:32.471 --> 34:33.536
FBI!

34:33.539 --> 34:34.670
Look at this!

34:34.672 --> 34:36.840
The geologists have
places on earth

34:36.842 --> 34:38.507
that already look like the moon.

34:38.510 --> 34:41.678
This is the barringer crater,
the Grand Canyon.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.246
We shoot this test footage

34:44.248 --> 34:46.349
and then compare it
with the real moon footage

34:46.351 --> 34:48.717
that they're getting
from the missions.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.120
I just figured this out!

34:50.121 --> 34:52.121
Yeah, I can't go on this trip.

34:52.123 --> 34:53.857
What?
What do you mean?

34:53.859 --> 34:55.592
Why?

34:55.594 --> 34:57.527
Because I... because I...
I need you.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.696
If you don't come with me I'm
going with boles, by myself.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.598
What? Are you
still mad at me?

35:01.600 --> 35:03.300
I'm sorry.
I didn't...

35:03.302 --> 35:04.601
Owen!

35:04.603 --> 35:06.536
One second!

35:06.538 --> 35:09.339
I... you have to forgive me for this.
Listen.

35:09.341 --> 35:10.507
I can't go.

35:14.412 --> 35:17.747
You're fucking me. You are...
You're fucking me.

35:22.653 --> 35:24.888
<i>This is the big shot.</i>

35:24.890 --> 35:28.792
<i>The ride without astronauts of
the giant saturn v live rocket.</i>

35:28.794 --> 35:31.862
<i>Project Apollo.</i>
<i>This is</i> Apollo 4.

35:31.864 --> 35:34.531
<i>The test of our moon rocket
in flight for the first time.</i>

35:34.533 --> 35:37.234
<i>It is the beginning,
the first of many steps,</i>

35:37.236 --> 35:40.770
<i>which will someday put men
on the surface of the moon.</i>

35:57.355 --> 35:58.755
How far off can you see?

35:58.757 --> 36:00.290
You've got to picture it
in black and white.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.691
With the sun behind us there.

36:01.693 --> 36:02.826
We can even do a pan.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.895
What do you think?

36:04.897 --> 36:07.197
<i>We don't know if you can hear,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

36:07.199 --> 36:10.433
<i>But, oh, the flight is moving
along as it should be...</i>

36:10.435 --> 36:12.869
<i>But our tape records are
being thrown to the floor</i>

36:12.871 --> 36:16.439
<i>by the roar of
this mighty rocket,</i>

36:16.441 --> 36:18.275
<i>as it continues
to climb into the sky,</i>

36:18.277 --> 36:21.645
<i>on its seven and a half
million pounds of thrust.</i>

36:21.647 --> 36:24.581
<i>It's a beautiful sight,
an unbelievable sight...</i>

36:24.583 --> 36:27.784
So I didn't tell him
i made the whole thing up,

36:27.786 --> 36:29.619
and then you
and brackett show up,

36:29.621 --> 36:30.921
and then he punches me,

36:30.923 --> 36:32.322
now he's acting like
we aren't friends.

36:32.324 --> 36:34.291
What would you do?

36:34.293 --> 36:36.226
Well, i wouldn't have done
that in the first place.

36:36.228 --> 36:37.494
Okay, yeah, but pretend
that you're as stupid as me

36:37.496 --> 36:38.595
and you have done that.

37:05.856 --> 37:08.425
God damn it, look at this!

37:08.427 --> 37:10.560
We weren't even close.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.728
No kidding.

37:15.866 --> 37:17.500
Here.

37:19.537 --> 37:21.671
Okay... Okay, who else
has seen this footage?

37:21.673 --> 37:22.872
Everyone.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.507
See, this is what we need.

37:24.509 --> 37:27.444
We need the actual
footage of the moon.

37:27.446 --> 37:30.313
How do we get astronauts
to act in front of this?

37:30.315 --> 37:32.983
You could start
by hiring a real director.

37:34.952 --> 37:37.454
Or you could give up
this mission.

37:39.323 --> 37:40.757
Yeah.

37:54.306 --> 37:55.472
Hey, don, how are you?

37:55.474 --> 37:57.040
It's Matt Johnson.

37:57.042 --> 37:58.575
No, I'm calling from Houston,

37:58.577 --> 38:01.611
they got me out here
on operation zipper.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.546
Listen, can...
I actually need a favor.

38:03.548 --> 38:06.483
Do we have a last known
address for Stanley kubrick

38:06.485 --> 38:08.585
when we were doing
operation deep red?

38:08.587 --> 38:10.020
I'm looking at some of his
movie effects and...

38:10.022 --> 38:11.888
"No, of course I'd
like to say hello!"

38:11.890 --> 38:13.323
<i>Of course I'd like to say hello.</i>

38:13.325 --> 38:14.491
And I'm watching something.

38:14.493 --> 38:15.892
Would you mind giving me that?

38:19.398 --> 38:22.565
Hi, could you give me the phone
number to an address in New York?

38:24.368 --> 38:25.969
239.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.705
Uh, actually, it's polaris
productions, incorporated.

38:28.707 --> 38:29.773
23...

38:29.775 --> 38:31.374
My name's Matt Johnson,

38:31.376 --> 38:33.877
I'm a documentary filmmaker
working at NASA,

38:33.879 --> 38:36.012
and I need to ask him
a few questions.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.647
Is he there?

38:37.649 --> 38:39.649
It's an emergency.

38:39.651 --> 38:42.085
Of course not. No. And... And
that's not what this is, ma'am.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.620
Yes, hello, my name is
Michael kubrick.

38:43.622 --> 38:44.954
I'm looking for my brother.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.656
Well, I'm calling
from the United States

38:46.658 --> 38:48.091
and I'm... and I'm really
trying to talk with him.

38:48.093 --> 38:52.062
I've got some very bad news
about our father.

38:52.064 --> 38:54.097
Can you give me
a phone number for that?

38:54.099 --> 38:55.965
What time is it in england?

38:55.967 --> 38:57.801
I'm looking for
a Mr. Stanley kubrick.

38:57.803 --> 39:00.403
I'm a documentary filmmaker
from the United States.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.040
This is not a personal call.

39:04.042 --> 39:07.911
I'm actually calling from
NASA and I'm wondering if...

39:07.913 --> 39:09.579
Oh, thank you.

39:12.750 --> 39:15.118
Hello, Madeleine. I'm not sure
why I got connected with you.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.420
I'm calling from NASA.

39:17.422 --> 39:19.489
I'm making a documentary here
about the Apollo program.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.730
Ah.

39:26.732 --> 39:28.832
What are you guys
doing over there,

39:28.834 --> 39:30.700
if you don't mind me asking?

39:36.574 --> 39:42.112
Stanley kubrick is making a new
movie about the moon landing,

39:42.114 --> 39:44.547
and I'm willing to bet that we
can use the special effects

39:44.549 --> 39:46.716
that he's doing there
to do this.

39:46.718 --> 39:47.984
Okay, but...

39:49.620 --> 39:51.888
We can't just walk
onto a film set.

39:51.890 --> 39:57.494
He has two NASA scientists
advising him.

39:57.496 --> 40:00.830
We're going to go and say
we're going to interview them.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.866
Do you see what's going on here?

40:02.868 --> 40:05.101
Kubrick is getting NASA

40:05.103 --> 40:08.605
to make sure that his space
movie looks like real space.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.840
And so we're going
to use his space movie

40:10.842 --> 40:13.743
to make sure the real space
movie looks like space!

40:13.745 --> 40:15.879
Do you understand
how crazy that is?

40:32.196 --> 40:33.863
Welcome to england!

40:35.901 --> 40:37.700
It's not too loud?

40:37.702 --> 40:39.636
No, well, it'll be
packed inside the bag.

40:46.577 --> 40:51.981
Not bad for... For on the
spot, just figured it out!

40:55.020 --> 40:57.487
Jared, wave!

40:57.489 --> 40:59.055
Jared, big wave!

41:04.795 --> 41:06.629
Yeah, that's her.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.704
Madeleine!

41:20.911 --> 41:23.046
You won't be able to bring
that camera inside.

41:23.048 --> 41:25.615
You'll have to shut it off as
soon as we get in, I'm afraid.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.150
Is Mr...
The set's all live.

41:27.152 --> 41:28.885
No problem.
Is Mr. kubrick inside?

41:28.887 --> 41:31.087
He is, but security
is very tight.

41:31.089 --> 41:34.257
You'll be thrown off the set if you
try to approach him, so please don't.

41:34.259 --> 41:35.992
You got it.
Go ahead.

41:35.994 --> 41:37.193
Thank you.

41:51.008 --> 41:53.576
Please wait right here.

41:53.578 --> 41:55.678
Yeah, sure.
We'll stay right here.

42:00.985 --> 42:02.952
It might be better to just
play it as a medium shot

42:02.954 --> 42:05.154
- in this situation.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

42:05.156 --> 42:06.956
Can you do it
with your head down?

42:06.958 --> 42:08.691
What about out there?

42:08.693 --> 42:11.728
- Well, that's not bad.
- Let's do that.

42:13.163 --> 42:15.098
Right.
Check the gate, Doug.

42:32.983 --> 42:35.652
I... I would never normally do
this, but it's for a friend.

42:35.654 --> 42:38.788
His name is Matt Johnson.
Mmm-hmm.

42:46.864 --> 42:50.133
Jared, tell me
you are getting this.

42:50.135 --> 42:51.701
Oh, my god.

42:51.703 --> 42:53.169
Excuse me?

42:53.171 --> 42:56.873
How did you set this up?

42:58.309 --> 43:01.044
Owen, it's called
front screen projection!

43:01.046 --> 43:02.245
We got it!

43:04.682 --> 43:07.350
Kubrick's technique,
how he's faking...

43:09.119 --> 43:11.154
I wanna...
I wanna tell you.

43:18.729 --> 43:20.597
Boles, hey.

43:20.599 --> 43:22.265
It's called
front screen projection.

43:22.267 --> 43:24.267
We figured out how to,
how to do it.

43:26.136 --> 43:28.838
Yeah, okay, all right.
I'll, uh...

43:28.840 --> 43:31.307
Do you want us
to fly right there, or...

43:33.644 --> 43:35.845
Sure.

43:48.025 --> 43:51.027
All right, it's called
front screen projection.

43:51.029 --> 43:54.130
Stanley kubrick can fake
any environment he wants,

43:54.132 --> 43:57.033
by projecting it through
a semi-transparent mirror

43:57.035 --> 43:59.802
and then onto
a gigantic silver screen.

43:59.804 --> 44:03.172
Then he films the entire scene
through the same mirror,

44:03.174 --> 44:05.775
at a 90-degree angle
to the projector.

44:05.777 --> 44:09.178
What it winds up doing
is creating images

44:09.180 --> 44:13.116
where you can't tell
where the stage stops

44:15.119 --> 44:18.321
and the fake photographic
background begins.

44:18.323 --> 44:20.423
You have an infinite
depth of field,

44:20.425 --> 44:26.129
into environments that exist
completely in two-dimensional space.

44:26.131 --> 44:29.399
We can do the same thing with
the lunar surface photography

44:29.401 --> 44:32.201
that NASA is taking
on the Apollo missions.

44:36.306 --> 44:39.976
<i>Movie special effects
can be very convincing,</i>

44:39.978 --> 44:44.180
<i>especially when you don't
know you're watching a movie.</i>

44:44.182 --> 44:47.383
<i>The plan is to rent
a film studio in Texas,</i>

44:47.385 --> 44:51.954
<i>hire a crew, and have them
build our own lunar lander.</i>

44:51.956 --> 44:54.157
<i>We'll mix
this practical set piece,</i>

44:54.159 --> 44:57.026
<i>with kubrick's projection
technique, and presto,</i>

44:57.028 --> 44:59.962
<i>the illusion that man
is walking on the moon.</i>

44:59.964 --> 45:02.899
<i>Now I know you're probably thinking
this is too much exposure,</i>

45:02.901 --> 45:05.902
<i>and that the risk of bringing
in outsiders is too high,</i>

45:05.904 --> 45:08.871
<i>but we already have
the perfect cover.</i>

45:08.873 --> 45:12.709
<i>We're making a documentary
about the moon landing.</i>

45:12.711 --> 45:15.712
<i>And it's not a stretch to say that we're
building sets to conduct interviews,</i>

45:15.714 --> 45:17.180
<i>shoot b-roll footage.</i>

45:17.182 --> 45:19.148
<i>We could even say
it's for simulations.</i>

45:19.150 --> 45:22.285
<i>Hell, most of the major networks
are doing this already.</i>

45:22.287 --> 45:23.953
<i>The only people who need to
know what's actually happening</i>

45:23.955 --> 45:26.189
<i>are the astronauts,</i>

45:26.191 --> 45:28.858
<i>who you should select based on
their willingness to cooperate,</i>

45:28.860 --> 45:30.993
<i>and James webb,</i>

45:30.995 --> 45:34.063
<i>who's either going to have to work
with us, or get out of the way.</i>

45:34.065 --> 45:36.132
And that's the easy part.

45:36.134 --> 45:38.234
We also need to convince
everybody at NASA.

45:38.236 --> 45:41.104
The good news is the only people
who are in contact with the rocket

45:41.106 --> 45:42.839
are all in one room in Houston,

45:42.841 --> 45:44.240
inside mission control.

45:45.409 --> 45:47.877
<i>If we can convince
mission control</i>

45:47.879 --> 45:48.978
<i>that what they're doing is real,</i>

45:48.980 --> 45:50.079
<i>everybody else will follow.</i>

45:50.081 --> 45:51.948
<i>How do we do that?</i>

45:51.950 --> 45:54.784
Well, mission control
actually monitors everything,

45:54.786 --> 45:56.285
<i>from the heart rates
of the astronauts,</i>

45:56.287 --> 45:58.054
<i>to the exact location
of the lunar module</i>

45:58.056 --> 46:00.156
<i>as it descends to the moon.</i>

46:00.158 --> 46:02.358
<i>And they're getting all this
information through radio,</i>

46:02.360 --> 46:03.993
<i>directly from the ship.</i>

46:03.995 --> 46:06.763
The good news is that
they've run so many tests

46:06.765 --> 46:08.898
with this exact mission

46:08.900 --> 46:13.002
that they actually have telemetric
data of successful lunar landings,

46:13.004 --> 46:16.172
<i>stored on guidance systems</i>
<i>on</i> Apollo 11.

46:17.908 --> 46:20.009
Here's where we get very lucky.

46:20.011 --> 46:21.444
As the command module
passes along

46:21.446 --> 46:23.045
to the dark side of the moon,

46:23.047 --> 46:26.082
the radio signals
can't penetrate the core.

46:26.084 --> 46:28.284
For 30 minutes, we have a window

46:28.286 --> 46:32.922
for the astronauts to switch from
real data, to fake telemetric data.

46:32.924 --> 46:35.191
<i>Mission control
will be getting data</i>

46:35.193 --> 46:38.961
<i>of the lunar module undocking and
landing on the lunar surface,</i>

46:38.963 --> 46:41.330
<i>but it will be completely faked.</i>

46:41.332 --> 46:43.499
Combine that with our footage

46:43.501 --> 46:46.803
that the astronauts are going to pipe
into the broadcast back to earth,

46:46.805 --> 46:49.372
and nobody's
going to have any idea.

46:49.374 --> 46:52.074
<i>As far as NASA and the rest
of the world is concerned,</i>

46:52.076 --> 46:54.210
<i>the United States
just landed on the moon.</i>

46:54.212 --> 46:57.847
Finally, the broadcast.

46:57.849 --> 47:00.316
To shoot in slow motion,
we have to shoot film.

47:00.318 --> 47:02.885
To broadcast
it needs to be video.

47:02.887 --> 47:04.020
Which means we have
to do a transfer,

47:04.022 --> 47:05.588
which normally would be fine,

47:05.590 --> 47:09.559
except that people cannot know
it originally began as film.

47:09.561 --> 47:12.028
That means a single
scratch, any dust...

47:12.030 --> 47:13.963
Okay, okay.
We got it.

47:13.965 --> 47:15.331
Thank you for the presentation.

47:15.333 --> 47:17.433
You can go ahead.

47:17.435 --> 47:19.602
- Thank you, sir.
- Talk to your folks about the northwoods plan.

47:19.604 --> 47:21.237
Tell them to put a hold on it

47:21.239 --> 47:24.006
and we'll see how this develops.

47:24.008 --> 47:26.242
Director, what is
the northwoods plan?

47:26.244 --> 47:28.878
I've never heard of
operation northwoods.

47:28.880 --> 47:32.548
Shoot down <i> Apollo 11</i>
and blame the Soviets.

47:33.985 --> 47:35.885
With the astronauts
on the flight?

47:35.887 --> 47:38.054
Why would we do that?

47:39.590 --> 47:42.191
If your film
doesn't come together,

47:42.193 --> 47:44.627
then we have to have
a backup plan.

47:44.629 --> 47:47.263
And that is our backup plan.

48:02.379 --> 48:04.914
<i>...plan? I've never heard
of operation northwoods.</i>

48:04.916 --> 48:07.116
<i>Shoot down Apollo 11
and blame the Soviets.</i>

48:33.310 --> 48:36.112
<i>Who were these men
going to the moon?</i>

48:36.114 --> 48:40.182
<i>David schoumacher profiled
the crew of Apollo 11.</i>

48:40.184 --> 48:42.184
<i>Neil Armstrong,</i>

48:42.186 --> 48:45.621
<i>the man chosen to be first
to step upon the moon.</i>

48:45.623 --> 48:48.958
<i>He is by all accounts
intelligent, courteous,</i>

48:48.960 --> 48:51.327
<i>sober, a good family man.</i>

48:51.329 --> 48:53.996
<i>He is perfect for the role,</i>

48:53.998 --> 48:58.234
<i>beyond what a Hollywood
scriptwriter would dare.</i>

48:58.236 --> 49:01.237
<i>Buzz aldrin is perhaps the most
brilliant of the astronauts.</i>

49:01.239 --> 49:03.472
<i>Some say even a genius.</i>

49:03.474 --> 49:08.177
<i>His doctorate at mit came after
a thesis on orbital rendezvous,</i>

49:08.179 --> 49:11.480
<i>and he understands the abstract
theory of space mechanics</i>

49:11.482 --> 49:13.983
<i>as well as anyone.</i>

49:13.985 --> 49:18.955
<i>Mike Collins is the least technical in
outlook of the Apollo 11 astronauts,</i>

49:18.957 --> 49:20.589
<i>but the most philosophical.</i>

49:20.591 --> 49:22.558
<i>If he does not love machines,</i>

49:22.560 --> 49:26.629
<i>he does love wine,
and books, and roses.</i>

49:26.631 --> 49:29.398
<i>A man who has known all
three pilots for many years</i>

49:29.400 --> 49:32.001
<i>says if he were
forced down on an island,</i>

49:32.003 --> 49:33.736
<i>he would want it
to be with Collins</i>

49:33.738 --> 49:36.038
<i>for the quality
of his personality.</i>

49:36.040 --> 49:37.573
<i>Another said
he would prefer aldrin,</i>

49:37.575 --> 49:39.608
<i>because with his intelligence</i>

49:39.610 --> 49:41.744
<i>he would soon be converting
sea water to fresh water</i>

49:41.746 --> 49:44.413
<i>and otherwise logically
attacking the problem.</i>

49:44.415 --> 49:46.983
<i>But both agreed
in the final analysis,</i>

49:46.985 --> 49:50.152
<i>that they would hope
it was with Armstrong,</i>

49:50.154 --> 49:54.056
<i>because, somehow,
he would get them off of it.</i>

50:01.232 --> 50:02.698
Hello?

50:02.700 --> 50:05.668
Boles, we just got back.
Where are you?

50:07.270 --> 50:09.605
Okay. Turn on the TV.

50:09.607 --> 50:11.607
Yeah, okay.
I'm turning it on now.

50:11.609 --> 50:14.076
- Why?
- <i>Summarize what you just said,</i>

50:14.078 --> 50:15.711
<i>and then we'll ask you some questions
about seeing the president?</i>

50:15.713 --> 50:20.483
<i>Uh, yes, I'd like to say
that, uh, over a year ago,</i>

50:20.485 --> 50:24.186
<i>president Johnson and I
reviewed the space program</i>

50:24.188 --> 50:27.523
<i>and, uh, agreed
to build strength</i>

50:27.525 --> 50:31.193
<i>so that I might retire
on my 62nd birthday,</i>

50:31.195 --> 50:34.130
<i>which happens to be
this next October 7th.</i>

50:34.132 --> 50:37.366
<i>Today, we have reviewed
the progress we have made</i>

50:37.368 --> 50:39.035
<i>and the president has agreed</i>

50:39.037 --> 50:42.271
<i>that I could retire
on October 7th,</i>

50:42.273 --> 50:44.073
<i>when I will be 62.</i>

50:44.075 --> 50:46.042
<i>I'd like to say
one other thing...</i>

50:46.044 --> 50:48.044
Yeah, okay.
Well, I guess that means

50:48.046 --> 50:50.279
he didn't want
to cooperate, huh?

50:50.281 --> 50:51.647
Okay, yeah.

50:51.649 --> 50:53.716
I'll see you when you get back.
Bye.

50:58.622 --> 51:00.322
Andy!

51:03.160 --> 51:04.427
Sorry.

51:06.830 --> 51:09.131
What are you doing? Shooting
for the documentary.

51:09.133 --> 51:10.433
Oh, okay, fine.

51:10.435 --> 51:12.768
Where's Owen?
He's at the hospital.

51:12.770 --> 51:14.270
What?

51:15.372 --> 51:17.173
Julie had the baby.

51:17.175 --> 51:18.808
Oh, shit!

51:21.611 --> 51:23.412
Hey.

51:23.414 --> 51:25.114
I missed it, hey?

51:25.116 --> 51:26.782
Hey, mom.

51:26.784 --> 51:28.484
Wow!

51:28.486 --> 51:29.585
Matt!

51:29.587 --> 51:31.487
What's his name?
Simon.

51:31.489 --> 51:33.456
Can I hold him?
Sure, if you want to.

51:33.458 --> 51:35.091
I need to talk to you.
I need to talk to Matt.

51:35.093 --> 51:36.859
Okay. What's up?

51:38.695 --> 51:41.831
One minute.

51:41.833 --> 51:44.834
Okay, okay.

51:44.836 --> 51:47.169
What the hell is this?

51:47.171 --> 51:48.437
Jared showed me
the photos of the men

51:48.439 --> 51:50.406
who were watching us
at the barbecue.

51:50.408 --> 51:52.241
They're filming us, Matt! Okay.

51:52.243 --> 51:54.610
Why are you bringing
this up at the hospital?

51:54.612 --> 51:56.178
Relax!

51:56.180 --> 51:57.813
Relax? This could
be the Russians.

51:57.815 --> 52:00.382
We have to get off this mission.

52:00.384 --> 52:04.887
If we get caught, the CIA
will abandon us, okay?

52:04.889 --> 52:07.456
I'm calling brackett to them him...
No! No! No!

52:07.458 --> 52:10.126
You are not calling brackett.
No one's calling brackett.

52:10.128 --> 52:11.627
You are being paranoid!

52:11.629 --> 52:15.197
I hope so, because if I'm
right and this is the mole...

52:15.199 --> 52:16.298
If they find out
what we are doing,

52:16.300 --> 52:18.200
then we are fucking dead.

52:18.202 --> 52:19.535
You got that?

53:21.665 --> 53:23.566
Looks pretty good.

53:23.568 --> 53:25.935
"Looks pretty good"?
Guys, come on.

53:28.805 --> 53:30.639
Are you kidding me?
All right.

53:30.641 --> 53:32.374
This cost $45,000!

53:33.510 --> 53:34.810
Really?
Yeah!

53:34.812 --> 53:37.279
Oh, god, don't start that.

53:37.281 --> 53:39.415
"Really? Hey,
you got ripped off.

53:39.417 --> 53:41.483
"Hey, come on, i could have
done this..." ...Cheaper.

53:41.485 --> 53:44.286
"...with $20
and some elbow grease!"

53:44.288 --> 53:46.355
Do you think it would kill you
to say, "good job, Matt"?

53:48.459 --> 53:51.293
I mean that seriously. Do you think
it would physically kill you?

53:51.295 --> 53:53.429
Okay, and it's for a film shoot.

53:53.431 --> 53:55.831
Uh, we're making a documentary
about the moon landing,

53:55.833 --> 53:57.800
and we need to make
a lunar surface.

53:57.802 --> 54:01.403
And so it's like a fake lunar surface.
That's what we need.

54:01.405 --> 54:04.740
So I don't know how much
sand you can ship us.

54:04.742 --> 54:06.875
But, uh, four tons?

54:06.877 --> 54:08.811
How many tons are in a truck?
Can you hold on a sec?

54:08.813 --> 54:10.779
Where are you going?

54:10.781 --> 54:12.748
Uh, sorry, say again?

54:12.750 --> 54:15.851
Actually, I went to a place in
Arizona called cinder lake,

54:15.853 --> 54:20.289
where the sand was brown as molasses.
It was beautiful.

54:20.291 --> 54:23.692
It was a beautiful brown.
Molten brown.

54:30.667 --> 54:33.569
So, what are these guys gonna
say when they're up here?

54:33.571 --> 54:36.005
We need something they
can print as a headline.

54:36.007 --> 54:38.874
<i>Type out a couple things and let's
just see what we got, okay?</i>

54:38.876 --> 54:41.610
So try this,
"welcome to the moon."

54:43.414 --> 54:45.614
Catch!

54:45.616 --> 54:47.950
So, no, leave that where
it was, it's my a rock.

54:47.952 --> 54:50.452
I think if we never say
the word "America."

54:50.454 --> 54:51.987
<i>Oh, yeah, we just take
an American symbol.</i>

54:51.989 --> 54:53.522
Exactly. Eagle.

54:53.524 --> 54:54.590
- Freedom.
- Frontier.

54:54.592 --> 54:56.725
Frontier.

54:56.727 --> 54:59.828
So that needs to make
that pothole there.

54:59.830 --> 55:01.363
Does that have a label on it?

55:01.365 --> 55:04.667
B. So that goes right at your feet.
Perfect.

55:04.669 --> 55:06.669
I just got an idea.

55:06.671 --> 55:08.304
You know what we've gotta have
them do when they're up there?

55:08.306 --> 55:09.838
Who is it, Galileo
or somebody, said...

55:09.840 --> 55:11.040
Oh, drop the feather.

55:11.042 --> 55:12.341
Drop the feather and the hammer.

55:12.343 --> 55:13.876
And he said, in a vacuum,

55:13.878 --> 55:16.078
a hammer and a feather
would fall at the same speed.

55:16.080 --> 55:17.846
Well, okay, but how are
we gonna do that?

55:17.848 --> 55:19.782
A lead feather.

55:19.784 --> 55:22.718
Wait a minute, we gotta keep the
flag as stable as possible,

55:22.720 --> 55:25.354
because the wind resistance
makes it billow.

55:25.356 --> 55:26.989
You wave the flag.
You can't do that!

55:26.991 --> 55:28.957
Okay Houston, I'm about
to step off the lm.

55:28.959 --> 55:31.327
He leaves a footprint there.

55:31.329 --> 55:32.928
'Cause they would leave
footprints there. Exactly!

55:32.930 --> 55:35.331
And we so can send photographs
of that back home.

55:35.333 --> 55:37.766
It's... that's...
That is the image!

55:37.768 --> 55:39.001
Write that down, the footprints!

55:39.003 --> 55:41.737
The word "foot" is disgusting.

55:41.739 --> 55:44.006
Maybe people
don't want to hear "foot."

55:44.008 --> 55:45.607
No, "with this step." You
would say, "with this step."

55:45.609 --> 55:47.676
"With this step."

55:47.678 --> 55:51.080
<i>Okay, okay.
"With this step, I..."</i>

55:51.082 --> 55:53.782
<i>No. "As man walks
on the moon..."</i>

55:53.784 --> 55:55.718
<i>Too literal.
Too literal!</i>

55:55.720 --> 55:57.386
<i>"The step of
a single man..."</i>

55:57.388 --> 55:58.654
<i>"The step of a single man.</i>

55:58.656 --> 56:00.422
<i>"But for us
back at home..."</i>

56:00.424 --> 56:02.458
Think of what
a step is like to us.

56:02.460 --> 56:04.393
To a man, a step is just a step.

56:04.395 --> 56:07.796
But to an ant looking up at
the man, he looks like a god.

56:07.798 --> 56:09.064
And it doesn't look like a step,

56:09.066 --> 56:12.901
it looks like a towering leap.

56:17.975 --> 56:20.042
It's like a leap.
It's like a jump.

56:20.044 --> 56:22.678
And this is a leap forward for...
For everything!

56:22.680 --> 56:24.012
The next evolutionary step.

56:24.014 --> 56:25.447
A leap forward in science.

56:25.449 --> 56:27.449
- For humanity.
- Exactly!

56:40.930 --> 56:42.631
This is good.

56:49.407 --> 56:50.806
Okay, let's try one.

56:50.808 --> 56:52.741
Hey.

56:52.743 --> 56:55.177
Do you know who that is outside?
Who?

56:56.646 --> 56:58.647
Right there.

56:58.649 --> 57:00.082
Look.
Where?

57:00.084 --> 57:01.550
Tell me whose that is.

57:02.919 --> 57:04.787
Is he running?

57:04.789 --> 57:06.155
Did you say hi? Did he look
at you when you came in?

57:06.157 --> 57:07.723
Is there even a guy in there?

57:07.725 --> 57:09.491
He's sitting there watching.

57:09.493 --> 57:11.460
Shh. Shh. Go
outside, you'll see.

57:11.462 --> 57:13.195
I'm sure he works for the studio.
I'll go talk to him.

57:13.197 --> 57:15.431
They know we're here. We're
allowed to be here, okay?

57:15.433 --> 57:16.665
Relax.

57:16.667 --> 57:17.733
Okay.

57:21.171 --> 57:23.172
Hi.

57:28.178 --> 57:31.480
Go, go, go, go!

57:31.482 --> 57:33.449
Jared, get in the car!

57:42.826 --> 57:44.593
Boles, what are you doing?

57:46.897 --> 57:49.031
What happened?
You shot your fucking gun!

57:51.201 --> 57:52.835
Jared, shoot out the front,

57:52.837 --> 57:54.770
try to get their license plate!

57:55.772 --> 57:58.907
Come on!

57:58.909 --> 58:00.943
- No!
- What?

58:08.751 --> 58:10.586
What happened?

58:10.588 --> 58:12.120
What happened to your car?

58:12.122 --> 58:14.690
It stalled.
They got away.

58:14.692 --> 58:16.925
Well, did
you get a look at them?

58:18.161 --> 58:20.162
Whoever it is,
they know we're here.

58:20.164 --> 58:21.230
Well, we don't know who it is.

58:21.232 --> 58:23.699
I think it's the mole.

58:23.701 --> 58:25.734
I think it's the mole that you guys sent
us here to find in the first place.

58:25.736 --> 58:27.603
Who else is waiting
outside the studio

58:27.605 --> 58:28.971
and then the minute we walk out...
Let's lock it up.

58:28.973 --> 58:30.639
Let's lock it up
and call brackett.

58:30.641 --> 58:31.907
What... lock it up?
We're in the middle of this!

58:31.909 --> 58:33.642
We can't just stop shooting!

58:33.644 --> 58:35.611
Well, there might be
guys on the roof.

58:35.613 --> 58:36.879
What do you mean,
guys on the roof?

58:36.881 --> 58:37.946
What the fuck is going on?

58:37.948 --> 58:39.715
And what, you got a gun?

58:39.717 --> 58:41.817
<i>This is</i> CBS news <i>special report.</i>

58:41.819 --> 58:43.585
<i>The flight of</i> Apollo 8.

58:43.587 --> 58:45.153
<i>Six days to the moon and back.</i>

58:45.155 --> 58:47.556
<i>Brought to you
by Walter cronkite.</i>

58:47.558 --> 58:50.559
<i>The flight of Apollo 8 is over.</i>

58:50.561 --> 58:54.096
<i>And all that remains is to remove the
astronauts from the space craft,</i>

58:54.098 --> 58:56.231
<i>and carry them
less than two miles</i>

58:56.233 --> 58:59.268
<i>to the deck of</i>
<i>the carrier</i> yorktown.

58:59.270 --> 59:02.104
<i>Future plans for space
missions, of course,</i>

59:02.106 --> 59:04.806
<i>have been accelerated
considerably.</i>

59:04.808 --> 59:07.242
<i>It means that they
can keep to the hoped-for</i>

59:07.244 --> 59:12.114
<i>schedule of the next</i>
Apollo 9 <i> mission,</i>

59:12.116 --> 59:14.716
<i>late in February,
or early in march,</i>

59:14.718 --> 59:17.185
<i>to test out the landing module,</i>

59:17.187 --> 59:20.789
<i>and, uh, then move on towards
landing a man on the moon</i>

59:20.791 --> 59:23.792
<i>two flights further on
in the middle of July.</i>

59:25.728 --> 59:29.698
So we've got
good news and bad news.

59:29.700 --> 59:34.236
Good news, his name
is antonin lhotsky.

59:34.238 --> 59:36.905
- Uh-huh.
- He's a kgb agent.

59:36.907 --> 59:38.874
He's the man from outside
the studio the other night.

59:38.876 --> 59:40.742
Whoa, what?

59:40.744 --> 59:43.011
We suspect he's been the
mole the entire time.

59:43.013 --> 59:45.914
So... so then he knows about avalanche.
We're fucked!

59:45.916 --> 59:47.849
We don't think he does.

59:47.851 --> 59:49.618
We've been interrogating him
for the past couple of days.

59:49.620 --> 59:50.819
He doesn't seem
to know anything.

59:50.821 --> 59:53.255
We've raided
his house. Nothing.

59:53.257 --> 59:55.924
This guy's the mole?
And you... you got him?

59:55.926 --> 59:57.359
We got him.

59:58.294 --> 01:00:03.098
So, then what?
We're just...

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.199
We're good?

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:06.068
Well, not entirely.

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:09.972
We, uh, got some new intel
on the Soviet progress,

01:00:09.974 --> 01:00:13.141
and it turns out they're doing
better than we thought.

01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:18.246
It looks like they could possibly make
it to the moon by the end of '69.

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:22.618
Which means that we need to be
done by April at the latest.

01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:27.022
Yeah, that puts us
on a pretty tight timeline.

01:00:27.024 --> 01:00:28.857
<i>They know we're here.</i>

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:30.759
<i>We're allowed to be here, okay?
Relax.</i>

01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:32.394
<i>Hi.</i>

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:40.202
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:44.172
<i>Jared, get in the car!</i>

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.868
<i>Hello?
Matt, we have a problem here.</i>

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:20.042
<i>...gentleman got the contract
with, I don't know, somebody.</i>

01:01:20.044 --> 01:01:22.377
This is who they say
the mole was.

01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:24.946
So we interviewed him?

01:01:24.948 --> 01:01:28.383
Yeah, over a year ago.

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:31.453
Remember when you asked me to find
out who was on the phone with webb?

01:01:31.455 --> 01:01:32.854
Of course.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:34.990
I did.

01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:36.958
<i>...second burn
to the lunar surface.</i>

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.227
<i>Then we can go in after...
For 250.</i>

01:01:39.229 --> 01:01:41.697
<i>250 seconds is all we can do?</i>

01:01:41.699 --> 01:01:44.032
<i>That's the maximum,
and you know that...</i>

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:46.068
<i>Did you talk to trw?</i>

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:49.237
<i>Yeah. And you know how they
are about their fuels.</i>

01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:50.972
<i>So we are in trouble...
Grumman...</i>

01:01:52.743 --> 01:01:54.109
What does this mean?

01:01:56.179 --> 01:02:00.449
So the mole knew that we
couldn't make it to the moon

01:02:00.451 --> 01:02:03.785
for over a year?

01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:06.088
I don't think so.

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:08.156
I don't think
that lhotsky's the mole,

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:11.860
I don't think lhotsky
was outside the studio.

01:02:11.862 --> 01:02:14.062
I mean, lhotsky knows that we
can't make it to the moon,

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:15.464
so maybe they...
He wouldn't cooperate

01:02:15.466 --> 01:02:17.766
and they had to
make him a fall guy

01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:18.867
by saying that he's the mole.

01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:19.935
They?

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:22.370
Yeah.

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:25.307
What do you mean? The CIA.

01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:29.177
Okay, well then, who's outside
the studio following us?

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:31.113
CIA agents.

01:02:31.115 --> 01:02:34.082
That's why boles
didn't shoot them.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:35.751
They're all working together.

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:38.220
They're all watching us,
and they're lying to us.

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:39.788
For what?
For what purpose?

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:41.056
They know everything
that we're doing.

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:43.325
Why... This doesn't
make any sense.

01:02:43.327 --> 01:02:46.261
There's no reason
for them to be following us.

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:47.996
You... have you...

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:50.966
Have you heard of a
conspiracy theory before?

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:52.968
Yeah.

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:54.836
I think we're in one.

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:57.499
Okay, leg out!

01:03:58.869 --> 01:04:00.101
That doesn't look real.

01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:01.469
Okay, you know what we'll do?

01:04:01.471 --> 01:04:04.172
Jump on the count of three.
Ready?

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.407
I'm bringing the bounce in.

01:04:05.409 --> 01:04:07.275
That's a big jump.

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:08.877
Come on, you're supposed
to be Neil Armstrong.

01:04:08.879 --> 01:04:10.011
He's brave. Ready?

01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:11.947
There we go.

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:16.952
Uh, change the background.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:22.290
One more.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.427
How about that?

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:27.329
Great.

01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:29.431
That's great.

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:31.233
What are we getting in the
reflection of his helmet?

01:04:31.235 --> 01:04:32.601
Am I in it?

01:04:32.603 --> 01:04:34.069
We'll have
to replace that after.

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:48.149
That looks great.
And then you just...

01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:49.918
We have to repress this.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.286
Put that on an animation
stand and reshoot it.

01:04:51.288 --> 01:04:53.955
This is the original
from the sound stage.

01:04:53.957 --> 01:04:55.991
And the crater textures
are added after.

01:04:55.993 --> 01:04:58.293
Getting rid of the
details in the studio.

01:04:58.295 --> 01:05:01.029
You go in and you black out
the areas with litho ink.

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:03.632
Let's move this
a little bit further down,

01:05:03.634 --> 01:05:06.334
because it seems
a little too square.

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:07.936
Square to camera?
Yeah.

01:05:07.938 --> 01:05:09.004
Sure.

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:15.610
Wow.

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:31.593
Ready?
That's good. Yeah, go.

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:34.062
It works.

01:05:34.064 --> 01:05:35.363
Yes!

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:38.633
This is amazing!
Go again.

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:41.269
Matt.
Yes?

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:42.671
Have you seen this?
Have you seen this?

01:05:42.673 --> 01:05:45.941
Do it again! Do it again!
Owen, look, look.

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:47.709
Hammer, feather.

01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:49.978
Drop!
Galileo was right.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:53.315
Dude, I just put
a weight in it. What?

01:05:53.317 --> 01:05:56.084
"NASA scientist dies."

01:05:56.086 --> 01:05:57.585
It's from this morning's paper.

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:02.991
Well, what the...
Matt, it's lhotsky.

01:06:02.993 --> 01:06:04.225
What?

01:06:04.227 --> 01:06:06.394
Boles, he must've
known about it.

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.431
Listen, think
why lhotsky's dead.

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:11.299
Obviously, he was talking to
webb, so they killed him.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:13.301
They're going to kill me...

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:15.337
We don't know why that guy's dead.
Yes, we do.

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:17.472
They're going to kill me?
What are you talking about?

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.140
They're going to kill us both, they're
going to kill the astronauts.

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:21.376
I'm sure... Anyone who
knows about this.

01:06:21.378 --> 01:06:23.745
I'm sure lhotsky knew too much and so
they got rid of him. Okay? That's it.

01:06:23.747 --> 01:06:26.381
Right! Right! That's
what I'm talking about!

01:06:26.383 --> 01:06:29.017
He was the mole, okay?

01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:32.053
No... no, they're tying
off loose ends!

01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:34.055
Yeah, and, so, who else
is gonna die, huh?

01:06:34.057 --> 01:06:36.992
They're gonna kill Jim webb? The
head of NASA? He knows, too!

01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:39.260
Maybe. Maybe. You don't
think they would?

01:06:39.262 --> 01:06:43.231
No! Okay, put the suit on and get
ready, all right? Shut the fuck up.

01:06:58.415 --> 01:07:03.018
There's a glob of something on the...
on the glass. Owen, could you get it?

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:06.087
No, it's right... You didn't get it.
It's right there.

01:07:06.089 --> 01:07:08.690
Right, right there.

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:11.359
What... What are you doing?
It's just a test.

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:13.395
Boles, I don't take
orders from you!

01:07:13.397 --> 01:07:15.563
- Oh, really?
- Enough, come on.

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:18.199
Yeah, I don't take orders from someone
who's trying to get us killed.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:20.068
Owen, Owen, Owen. Drop it.

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:21.302
He let them get away.
No, he didn't...

01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:22.804
Right?
He let them get away!

01:07:22.806 --> 01:07:24.606
That's what you did.
Oh, really?

01:07:24.608 --> 01:07:26.641
- Yes, you missed on purpose!
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:29.210
What... what are you doing? What
are you doing? We're friends.

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:30.745
Who are they?
We're friends.

01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:33.782
Who are they?
Is it brackett? The CIA?

01:07:33.784 --> 01:07:36.251
Why don't you tell him about how you've
been calling brackett every day,

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:40.088
trying to get Johnson thrown off
the mission. Tell him that!

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:42.357
What are you talking about?
Hey, ask your friend.

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:49.064
Okay, hold on.

01:07:49.066 --> 01:07:51.633
Tell him. Tell him.

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:12.253
<i>We choose to go to the moon.</i>

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:14.222
<i>We choose to go to the moon.</i>

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:23.198
<i>We choose to go to the moon
in this decade</i>

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.200
<i>and do the other things.</i>

01:08:25.202 --> 01:08:28.703
<i>Not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.</i>

01:08:28.705 --> 01:08:32.774
<i>Because that goal will serve
to organize and measure</i>

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:36.478
<i>the best
of our energies and skills.</i>

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:40.281
<i>Because that challenge is one
that we're willing to accept.</i>

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:46.154
<i>One we are unwilling to postpone, and one
we intend to win, and the others, too.</i>

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:55.529
<i>We shall send to the moon,</i>

01:08:55.532 --> 01:09:01.301
<i>240,000 miles away from the
control station in Houston,</i>

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:03.470
<i>a giant rocket,</i>

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:08.143
<i>more than 300 feet tall, the
length of this football field,</i>

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:12.913
<i>made of new metal alloys, some of
which have not yet been invented,</i>

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:15.884
<i>capable of standing
heat and stresses</i>

01:09:15.886 --> 01:09:19.487
<i>several times more than
have ever been experienced,</i>

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.856
<i>on an untried mission</i>

01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:24.359
<i>to an unknown celestial body,</i>

01:09:24.361 --> 01:09:27.662
<i>and then return it
safely to earth,</i>

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:32.533
<i>re-entering the atmosphere at speeds
of over 25,000 miles per hour,</i>

01:09:32.536 --> 01:09:36.671
<i>and do all this... And do
all this and do it right,</i>

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:39.941
<i>and do it first,
before this decade is out,</i>

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:41.876
<i>then we must be bold.</i>

01:09:44.915 --> 01:09:47.415
<i>And therefore, as we set sail,</i>

01:09:47.417 --> 01:09:51.920
<i>we ask god's blessing on the
most hazardous and dangerous</i>

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:55.423
<i>and greatest adventure on
which man has ever embarked.</i>

01:09:55.425 --> 01:09:56.758
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:20.215
So this is the only copy?

01:10:20.217 --> 01:10:24.519
Yeah. So, now what? We
just bring it to brackett?

01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:27.422
Oh, I'll take it to brackett.
You stay here and clean up.

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:29.924
Clean up what?

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:32.860
Clean up the studio.
Destroy everything.

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:36.664
What if we... What if
we need that stuff?

01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:39.834
We won't.
Good work.

01:10:39.836 --> 01:10:42.837
Thanks.
I'll see you soon.

01:10:42.839 --> 01:10:47.242
- Hey, boles.
- Lhotsky wasn't the mole, was he?

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:55.917
What are you talking about?

01:10:58.854 --> 01:11:01.489
Yeah, I don't...

01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:03.024
I don't know.

01:11:03.026 --> 01:11:05.860
I've been working on this too long.
I'm sorry.

01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:07.929
Well, get some rest.

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:09.631
I'll see you soon.

01:11:09.633 --> 01:11:11.633
Bye, buddy.

01:12:18.435 --> 01:12:23.004
<i>He's gonna spot one of our guys pretending
to be a rocket scientist instantly.</i>

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:27.575
<i>We need to send people who are gonna look
like they have no idea what's going on.</i>

01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:40.955
<i>They can't make it to the moon.</i>

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:44.826
<i>I'm gonna tell you
what they said.</i>

01:12:51.401 --> 01:12:53.534
<i>...an ethical problem
with this at all?</i>

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.680
<i>He let them get away! That's what you did.
Oh, really?</i>

01:13:05.682 --> 01:13:07.615
<i>Yes, you missed on purpose!</i>

01:13:07.617 --> 01:13:09.550
<i>Hey whoa, whoa, whoa!
What... what are you doing?</i>

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:11.085
<i>What are you doing?
We're friends!</i>

01:13:11.087 --> 01:13:13.121
<i>- Who are they?
- We're friends.</i>

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:18.559
<i>What, you think that's your friend?
Who, brackett?</i>

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.695
<i>The CIA? Why don't you
tell him about how...</i>

01:14:07.043 --> 01:14:10.211
Hey, Julie.
Can I borrow your husband?

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:17.151
He what?
Simon's asleep. Inside.

01:14:17.153 --> 01:14:19.153
I can go inside
so you guys can talk.

01:14:19.155 --> 01:14:20.988
You can stay outside.

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:24.525
No, I don't need to talk.
I wanna know if, um...

01:14:24.527 --> 01:14:28.796
If you wanna... we're... We're going
to get rid of the stuff from work.

01:14:31.099 --> 01:14:33.801
You can go if you want.

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:35.770
No, I'm going to stay here.

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:42.210
How's Simon? Are you guys
excited about the big launch?

01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:49.717
Okay.
Have a good afternoon.

01:14:49.719 --> 01:14:51.619
Thanks. You, too.
I'll see you soon, okay?

01:14:51.621 --> 01:14:52.854
Yeah, bye.

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:08.002
<i>Good morning.</i>

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:12.273
<i>It's t-minus one hour, 29 minutes
and 53 seconds and counting.</i>

01:15:12.275 --> 01:15:16.577
<i>In just an hour and a half, if all
goes well, Apollo eleven astronauts,</i>

01:15:16.579 --> 01:15:18.779
<i>Armstrong, aldrin and Collins</i>

01:15:18.781 --> 01:15:22.116
<i>are to lift off
from pad 39-a out there</i>

01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:25.553
<i>on the voyage man always
has dreamed about.</i>

01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:28.256
<i>Next stop for them, the moon.</i>

01:15:28.258 --> 01:15:30.892
<i>And we are all about
to witness the fulfillment</i>

01:15:30.894 --> 01:15:33.694
<i>of that promise
that president Kennedy made</i>

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:39.600
<i>at rice university stadium in
Texas, on September 12, 1962.</i>

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:41.802
<i>We passed 10,000 odd cars</i>

01:15:41.804 --> 01:15:44.572
<i>parked around the gate-1 area at 4:00 A.M.
when we got here.</i>

01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:47.975
<i>Cars from every state, with
little kids staring wide-eyed,</i>

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:51.245
<i>and we saw
teenagers with telescopes.</i>

01:15:51.247 --> 01:15:53.981
<i>It was a very moving scene
for me, because</i>

01:15:53.983 --> 01:15:57.184
<i>Americans cared then,
I think, and they care now.</i>

01:15:57.186 --> 01:16:01.122
<i>And it says, "good luck,</i> Apollo
11" <i>engraved in the sand.</i>

01:16:01.124 --> 01:16:05.226
<i>All going very smoothly
here with the count.</i>

01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:07.295
<i>T-minus 60 seconds
and counting.</i>

01:16:07.297 --> 01:16:10.898
<i>We've passed t-minus 60.
Power transfer is complete.</i>

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:18.072
<i>Twelve, eleven, ten, nine...</i>

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:20.775
<i>Ignition sequence starts.</i>

01:16:20.777 --> 01:16:26.314
<i>Six, five, four,
three, two, one.</i>

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:57.645
<i>And good afternoon from abc
space headquarters in New York.</i>

01:16:57.647 --> 01:17:01.115
<i>With me is our science editor, Jules
bergman and we are on the air today</i>

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:05.052
<i>to bring you a complete report on
some very, very important maneuvers</i>

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:07.154
<i>to be performed by</i> Apollo 11.

01:17:07.156 --> 01:17:08.723
<i>Basically a position
to begin the process...</i>

01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:09.824
Hello?

01:17:09.826 --> 01:17:11.692
<i>Matt?</i>

01:17:11.694 --> 01:17:13.661
Are you... Are you
seeing this right now?

01:17:13.663 --> 01:17:16.063
<i>- Matt, they're not dead.
- The CIA lied to us.</i>

01:17:16.065 --> 01:17:18.299
Wait, what?

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:20.935
<i>The men following us at the
studio are outside my house.</i>

01:17:20.937 --> 01:17:23.304
Are you sure? <i>Yes,
meet me at your motel.</i>

01:17:31.079 --> 01:17:33.214
What the hell?

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:38.252
Owen?

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:43.424
Hello?

01:17:57.072 --> 01:17:58.873
Who's there?

01:17:58.875 --> 01:18:00.174
Oh, shit.

01:18:01.943 --> 01:18:04.245
Okay, okay, okay.

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:10.051
Uh... uh...

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.088
Where's the other car?
Where's the...

01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:16.190
Um, um, out back.
Out back.

01:18:26.002 --> 01:18:28.102
Okay, stand back.

01:18:50.993 --> 01:18:53.027
Sorry.

01:18:53.029 --> 01:18:54.962
<i>There is a delirium
of enthusiasm today...</i>

01:19:00.035 --> 01:19:01.802
Come on.

01:19:01.804 --> 01:19:03.838
Come on, come on.

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:13.781
Come on, Owen.
Come on!

01:19:23.158 --> 01:19:25.960
Matt!

01:19:25.962 --> 01:19:27.495
What?

01:19:27.497 --> 01:19:29.263
There's a car!

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.108
Jared, run!

01:19:47.983 --> 01:19:51.118
Shit.
Go, go, go.

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:02.830
Andy, hold on.

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:11.806
Fuck.

01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:21.081
They're right behind us.
They're right behind us.

01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:29.423
Get their faces! Get their faces, Andy!
Get their faces!

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:31.292
This is fucking crazy!

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:40.134
Oh, god!
Oh, Christ!

01:20:44.973 --> 01:20:46.874
He's got a gun!
What?

01:20:46.876 --> 01:20:49.343
- He's got a fucking gun.
- Okay, duck, duck, duck!

01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:58.052
Shit.

01:21:11.968 --> 01:21:13.400
What's happening?

01:21:15.171 --> 01:21:17.872
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

01:21:26.549 --> 01:21:28.115
Okay, okay.

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:37.057
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:38.259
I'm trying.
Get out of here.

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:41.896
Dude, they're
right in front of us.

01:21:41.898 --> 01:21:43.163
Yeah, I know.

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:50.437
They're gonna ram us,
they're gonna ram us!

01:21:58.013 --> 01:21:59.680
Oh!

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:26.006
Owen!

01:22:26.008 --> 01:22:28.042
Owen!

01:22:28.044 --> 01:22:29.576
Owen!

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.614
Owen!

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:46.961
Owen!

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:04.398
So they're not
all labeled, right?

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:08.802
It goes '67, '68, '69. But not
everything's... Not everything's marked.

01:25:08.804 --> 01:25:11.271
Well, you'll figure it out.

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:12.773
Hey.

01:25:20.348 --> 01:25:22.449
Okay, man.

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:24.485
As soon as I know where
we're going, I'll call you.

01:25:24.487 --> 01:25:25.686
Yeah.

01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:53.273
<i>Good evening.</i>

01:26:53.275 --> 01:26:55.609
Hello, there's a man at the end
of the bar wearing glasses.

01:26:55.611 --> 01:26:57.878
Could you please give
the phone to him?

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:04.251
Telephone.

01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:10.924
<i>Hello?</i>

01:27:10.926 --> 01:27:13.360
You're a real piece of
shit, you know that?

01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:19.566
<i>We're looking for you.
Where you been?</i>

01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:21.501
Yeah, I'll tell you what,
let's make a trade.

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:24.805
<i>Okay.</i>

01:27:24.807 --> 01:27:27.574
My location for the names of
the agents on your kill team.

01:27:29.644 --> 01:27:31.511
<i>We don't have any kill team.</i>

01:27:31.513 --> 01:27:34.748
Yeah, well, who killed Owen
and hung him in his garage?

01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:41.822
<i>Okay. Come down to the office.
We'll discuss it.</i>

01:27:41.824 --> 01:27:43.724
Yeah, I'll come in.

01:27:43.726 --> 01:27:45.325
No, I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.

01:27:45.327 --> 01:27:47.561
I have a film
of everything we did.

01:27:47.563 --> 01:27:50.831
I have proof that the CIA conspired
to fake the moon landing

01:27:50.833 --> 01:27:54.301
and that Owen Williams is the one that
everybody is about to see walk on the moon.

01:27:54.303 --> 01:27:57.337
And that you killed him
to keep it a secret.

01:27:57.339 --> 01:27:59.306
I even got you
planning northwoods,

01:27:59.308 --> 01:28:01.441
the same as I got you right now.

01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:11.518
<i>No one will take
that seriously, kid.</i>

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.587
Yeah, well, call my bluff.

01:28:13.589 --> 01:28:16.890
My last movie's about to convince
the world we went to the moon.

01:28:16.892 --> 01:28:20.327
<i>Then why don't
I make you a deal?</i>

01:28:20.329 --> 01:28:21.962
<i>Come back and work for us,</i>

01:28:21.964 --> 01:28:25.966
<i>and I'll make you the head
of your own department.</i>

01:28:28.537 --> 01:28:32.973
Yeah, how stupid
do you think I am?

01:28:36.345 --> 01:28:38.745
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

01:28:38.747 --> 01:28:43.050
<i>Keep the film as collateral if you
don't believe me. Just think about it.</i>

01:29:28.429 --> 01:29:32.499
<i>...the surface appears
to be, uh,</i>

01:29:32.501 --> 01:29:36.370
<i>very, very fine grained as
you get close to it.</i>

01:29:36.372 --> 01:29:38.572
<i>It's almost like a powder.</i>

01:29:38.574 --> 01:29:41.775
<i>Down there, uh, is very fine.</i>

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:46.146
<i>Okay, I'm going to
step off the lm now.</i>

01:29:51.853 --> 01:29:55.055
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

01:29:56.791 --> 01:30:00.694
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:17.477
<i>And the, uh, the surface
is fine and powdery.</i>

01:30:17.479 --> 01:30:21.915
<i>I can... I can pick
it up loosely with my toe.</i>

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:24.885
<i>It does adhere in fine...</i>

01:33:01.577 --> 01:33:03.610
<i>Okay, we shouldn't take</i>

01:33:03.612 --> 01:33:06.313
<i>any more pictures on this roll
until earth comes, I don't think.</i>

01:33:06.315 --> 01:33:09.683
<i>This is about out, it's just about
out until our last color roll,</i>

01:33:09.685 --> 01:33:12.185
<i>so, uh, we'll switch to black and
white as soon as we get to earth.</i>

01:33:12.187 --> 01:33:14.621
<i>- We might make it in time.
- Yeah.</i>

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:20.660
<i>There it is, it's coming up.
What?</i>

01:33:20.662 --> 01:33:22.195
<i>The earth.
You see it?</i>

01:33:22.197 --> 01:33:23.830
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:33:23.832 --> 01:33:28.101
<i>Beautiful.
It's half-way up.</i>

01:33:29.305 --> 01:33:35.818
