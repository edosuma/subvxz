_

00:05.948 --> 00:07.048
Today is my birthday.

00:09.085 --> 00:10.985
I love September 11th.

00:10.987 --> 00:12.753
Thank you.

00:16.625 --> 00:19.727
Oh, Chair, this must
be so exciting for you.

00:19.729 --> 00:22.296
It's your first
Lillian's birthday.

00:22.298 --> 00:24.699
Why aren't these diamonds
inside the pi?ata?

00:24.701 --> 00:27.101
You're asleep
at the switch of danger.

00:27.103 --> 00:28.102
Now hurry, before...

00:44.018 --> 00:45.619
Here we go.

00:50.459 --> 00:52.025
I said I wanted a gold pony,

00:52.027 --> 00:54.961
and the one you gave me
is only painted gold.

00:54.963 --> 00:58.131
Yes, dear, we tried to dip
the pony in molten gold,

00:58.133 --> 00:59.966
but it put up
such a terrible fight.

00:59.968 --> 01:02.235
I cannot believe this
is how I'm being treated

01:02.237 --> 01:04.804
by my own family on my...

01:04.806 --> 01:06.572
birthday!

01:06.574 --> 01:09.108
Ugh!

01:11.246 --> 01:13.078
You're ruining my life!

01:13.080 --> 01:16.315
Ever since Lillian first
began her womanly bleeding,

01:16.317 --> 01:18.917
her birthday has been
a menagerie of horrors.

01:18.919 --> 01:20.653
I said a gold pony!

01:20.655 --> 01:21.654
Gah!

01:32.733 --> 01:33.966
Hello, Wiener.

01:36.302 --> 01:38.170
Daddy's home.

01:55.422 --> 01:57.355
When I saw that pile

01:57.357 --> 01:59.590
of human excrement
Charles Ponzi,

01:59.592 --> 02:02.693
I retired to the sanctity
of my bedroom.

02:04.629 --> 02:08.232
How dare she bring another man
into this house?

02:08.234 --> 02:10.601
I refuse to be scandalized.

02:10.603 --> 02:15.406
Tabu, dispense the gifts while
I give a rousing amends speech.

02:15.408 --> 02:17.107
This little fellow's Tabu.

02:17.109 --> 02:18.909
Won him in a game of Kariki.

02:18.911 --> 02:22.946
One of the cuter brownies,
if I do say so myself.

02:22.948 --> 02:24.047
I love this.

02:24.049 --> 02:26.116
I'm going to name it Frederick.

02:26.118 --> 02:29.219
Ponzi left my sister
at the altar when she was 12.

02:29.221 --> 02:30.788
He's a selfish jerk,

02:30.790 --> 02:33.423
and that's the total opposite
of Lillian.

02:34.725 --> 02:36.392
My darling Lillian.

02:36.394 --> 02:38.728
There was no excuse for me
leaving you at the altar,

02:38.730 --> 02:41.064
nor for me banging
that hermaphrodite

02:41.066 --> 02:42.165
in my dressing chambers.

02:42.167 --> 02:44.000
I was... I was a mess.

02:44.002 --> 02:46.369
Don't think I knew
about that last part.

02:46.371 --> 02:48.237
Don't worry,
you're much prettier.

02:48.239 --> 02:49.238
Whoa-ho-ho!

02:49.240 --> 02:51.641
I am so sorry, everyone.

02:51.643 --> 02:53.008
Tabu...

02:53.010 --> 02:54.677
Who told you it was okay

02:54.679 --> 02:58.147
for air to pass through
your lips and vocal cords?

02:58.149 --> 02:59.181
Nobody.

02:59.183 --> 03:00.450
Nobody, no.

03:00.452 --> 03:02.652
Now go get the servant gift.

03:02.654 --> 03:03.820
Go!

03:06.556 --> 03:10.092
It's a Puffing Billy,
for your servants.

03:10.094 --> 03:13.762
New technology,
sucks the dust right up.

03:13.764 --> 03:16.765
Tick-tock,
the time has come.

03:16.767 --> 03:19.434
Open your gift,
my fat, little Wiener.

03:21.170 --> 03:23.538
It's the jewel
of the seven snakes.

03:23.540 --> 03:24.740
They say every time
you touch it,

03:24.742 --> 03:26.274
a village somewhere
in the world

03:26.276 --> 03:27.809
is afflicted
with a flesh-eating disease.

03:27.811 --> 03:29.811
Oh, how charming!

03:29.813 --> 03:32.614
Oh, Charles, I've always
wanted a cursed jewel,

03:32.616 --> 03:35.083
ever since I saw
that blood-soaked opal in...

03:35.085 --> 03:36.585
Morocco.

03:38.487 --> 03:39.888
What a summer that was.

03:39.890 --> 03:40.955
I was 11,

03:40.957 --> 03:42.891
the height of a woman's
sexual peak.

03:42.893 --> 03:45.526
Never before had I seen
so much art

03:45.528 --> 03:47.528
or had so much humping.

03:47.530 --> 03:49.497
To this day,
I still can't look at an African

03:49.499 --> 03:51.732
without tasting Ponzi's semen.

03:51.934 --> 03:54.034
Peepers, more champagne.

03:54.036 --> 03:55.069
Yes.

03:59.241 --> 04:01.075
Excuse me.

04:01.077 --> 04:03.276
Oh, the shame.

04:03.278 --> 04:04.478
Where are you going?

04:04.480 --> 04:07.214
Your break isn't until March.

04:07.216 --> 04:10.817
I remember when we had
to put our butler down.

04:43.816 --> 04:45.584
Miss Hortense,
I don't mean to be meddlesome,

04:45.586 --> 04:48.720
but your menstruation cup
is empty.

04:48.722 --> 04:49.955
Oh?

04:49.957 --> 04:51.557
Either you've hit
menopause early

04:51.559 --> 04:53.492
or you're up the duff.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.027
That's not possible.

04:55.029 --> 04:56.094
I'm barren.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.729
How do you know you're barren?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.532
My sisters have yelled it
at me since I was eight.

04:59.534 --> 05:00.866
I've had my fingers
in a lot of women,

05:00.868 --> 05:03.268
and I know a pregnant vagina
when I feel it.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.836
No!

05:04.838 --> 05:06.304
Oh, this is awful.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.806
I mean, I was the barren one.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.007
It's what made me special.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.175
It's my thing!

05:10.177 --> 05:11.176
Don't you see?

05:11.178 --> 05:12.343
This is a blessing.

05:12.345 --> 05:14.479
You can say good-bye
to your friends,

05:14.481 --> 05:15.814
your dream to be a writer,

05:15.816 --> 05:18.082
and simply stay home
and wipe dirt

05:18.084 --> 05:19.950
off your baby's butt.

05:19.952 --> 05:21.519
I must go.

05:21.521 --> 05:23.421
The grouse liver
won't deworm itself.

05:23.423 --> 05:24.589
Wait.

05:24.591 --> 05:27.559
There must be something
I can do.

05:27.561 --> 05:28.893
There is an old folk remedy

05:28.895 --> 05:30.495
called "throw yourself
down the stairs,"

05:30.497 --> 05:32.397
but it gets a bit messy.

05:32.399 --> 05:33.764
Lucky for you,

05:33.766 --> 05:36.167
I know someone who helps
girls in this situation.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.768
Really?

05:44.343 --> 05:45.576
Peepers!

05:45.578 --> 05:47.544
Sweet Peepers!

05:47.546 --> 05:49.046
Somebody call the doctor!

05:49.048 --> 05:50.847
No, no doctors!

05:50.849 --> 05:54.284
Garfield, go into my room.

05:54.286 --> 05:56.186
Look under my bed...

05:56.188 --> 05:58.188
Yes.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.989
And find my iron lung.

05:59.991 --> 06:01.024
- Yes.
- Go.

06:01.026 --> 06:02.092
- Ow.
- Go.

06:02.094 --> 06:03.460
Yes!

06:05.697 --> 06:07.931
Get the sherry glasses ready.

06:07.933 --> 06:09.733
Rearrange the tinctures.

06:09.735 --> 06:11.400
Refill the night biscuits.

06:11.402 --> 06:13.937
Wait, stop.

06:13.939 --> 06:15.105
My God.

06:15.107 --> 06:16.940
I've never seen the house
from this angle.

06:16.942 --> 06:19.508
We need to begin a whole new
dusting regimen.

06:19.510 --> 06:22.411
Oh, there you are.

06:22.413 --> 06:24.146
I've been very concerned.

06:24.148 --> 06:25.648
Thank you, madam.
I'm feeling much better.

06:25.650 --> 06:27.583
About dessert.

06:27.585 --> 06:29.352
You remember the last time

06:29.354 --> 06:31.287
Lillian's birthday cake
was wrong.

06:31.289 --> 06:34.022
Frederick Douglass died.

06:34.024 --> 06:35.124
Yes.

06:35.126 --> 06:36.925
Yes, madam.

06:41.430 --> 06:42.798
What are you doing here?

06:42.800 --> 06:44.066
You know I'm a married woman.

06:44.068 --> 06:46.268
I don't give a crap
about some ring

06:46.270 --> 06:47.669
that some chump bought you.

06:47.671 --> 06:49.738
I had an epiphany
the other day.

06:49.740 --> 06:51.606
It was a vision of the future.

06:51.608 --> 06:54.442
I was standing on
a giant mountain of money,

06:54.444 --> 06:56.645
and you were by my side.

06:56.647 --> 06:58.713
And beautiful rays
of godly light

06:58.715 --> 07:00.014
were shooting out
of all your holes.

07:00.016 --> 07:02.284
- All my holes?
- All your holes.

07:02.286 --> 07:05.086
I own 12 houses
in 12 countries.

07:05.088 --> 07:09.691
The only thing I don't own
is the woman I love.

07:09.693 --> 07:11.526
Romance powder!

07:14.197 --> 07:15.930
Oh, Charles.

07:15.932 --> 07:18.132
You always knew how
to get my defenses down.

07:19.568 --> 07:21.769
I'm the only man
who will ever truly love you.

07:21.771 --> 07:25.506
And I'm definitely
the only man...

07:25.508 --> 07:27.508
who knows how
to do this to you.

07:29.512 --> 07:31.478
I feel like I'm 11 again!

07:32.847 --> 07:33.781
No, you don't.

07:38.003 --> 07:40.837
I want those vegetables
julienned for the cruditÃ©s.

07:40.839 --> 07:42.005
Where is that aspic?

07:42.007 --> 07:45.041
Is it chilled?
Is it chilled?

07:45.043 --> 07:48.178
Too much salt!

07:48.180 --> 07:48.978
Or is it sugar?

07:48.980 --> 07:50.313
I can't tell anymore.

07:50.315 --> 07:53.149
Everything tastes
like burnt toast points.

07:53.151 --> 07:54.517
Oh, you must stop working,

07:54.519 --> 07:56.052
I beg of you.

07:56.054 --> 07:57.954
Boy, I've been in charge
of Lillian's birthday

07:57.956 --> 08:00.757
since before she was born.

08:00.759 --> 08:02.458
Peepers...
no, you can't leave us.

08:02.460 --> 08:04.694
- Peepers, no, please.
- Blanche, Blanche?

08:04.696 --> 08:06.195
- Yes.
- Where are you, Blanche?

08:06.197 --> 08:07.563
- Yes, I'm here.
- Blanche, I can't see you.

08:07.565 --> 08:09.231
- I'm right here.
- Blanche, come closer.

08:09.233 --> 08:10.699
- I'm right here.
- Blanche, I asked for you

08:10.701 --> 08:11.933
to come closer, damn it.
I can't see you.

08:11.935 --> 08:13.269
- Just talk to me.
- Blanche.

08:13.271 --> 08:17.373
I need you to chiffon
the great turtle.

08:17.375 --> 08:19.608
What?

08:21.745 --> 08:24.780
Father, I'm coming to see you.

08:25.783 --> 08:27.282
Peepers?

08:27.284 --> 08:29.084
Peepers.

08:29.086 --> 08:30.786
Peepers!

08:30.788 --> 08:32.120
To hell with all this!

08:32.121 --> 08:33.955
Blanche, go call Dr. Goldberg!

08:33.957 --> 08:35.090
Yes.

08:35.092 --> 08:38.226
Everyone, this cake
has too much sugar!

08:38.227 --> 08:41.229
And fix this... pie!
Let's go!

08:41.231 --> 08:43.764
What are you
lollygagging around for?

08:43.765 --> 08:45.200
Make some balloon animals!

08:45.202 --> 08:47.268
It's Lillian's birthday!

08:53.576 --> 08:55.443
Hey, pretty lady.

08:55.445 --> 08:56.977
Why'd you leave the party?

08:56.979 --> 08:58.413
I don't talk
to my own children.

08:58.415 --> 08:59.780
Why would I talk to you?

08:59.782 --> 09:03.550
You don't like my master
very much, do you?

09:03.552 --> 09:05.953
I have something that can
take your mind off it.

09:05.955 --> 09:07.487
Delicacy from my homeland.

09:07.489 --> 09:09.090
Ew, I don't eat green food.

09:09.092 --> 09:10.657
Not food.
Drug.

09:10.659 --> 09:12.593
Oh, so I just chew it?

09:12.595 --> 09:13.961
Mm-hmm.

09:15.963 --> 09:18.232
You are very pretty
when you chew khat.

09:18.234 --> 09:19.833
Oh, thank you.

09:19.835 --> 09:21.835
- Have you ever heard of Reiki?
- Uh-uh.

09:21.837 --> 09:23.103
That's when I touch you
all over

09:23.105 --> 09:24.471
without touching you at all.

09:24.473 --> 09:27.341
- May I?
- Mm-hmm.

09:33.215 --> 09:35.815
Oh, I'm seeing someone, sorry.

09:39.286 --> 09:40.286
Oh!

09:41.889 --> 09:43.489
- What?
- I didn't realize.

09:43.491 --> 09:44.624
Am I interrupting?

09:44.626 --> 09:46.760
No, no.

09:46.762 --> 09:49.795
How can...
how can I help?

09:49.797 --> 09:51.497
There is an emergency
downstairs.

09:51.499 --> 09:53.399
Okay, yes.

09:53.401 --> 09:55.401
Let's go downstairs.

09:59.939 --> 10:03.041
I don't know
how to tell you this.

10:03.043 --> 10:04.510
It may be time
for Peepers to go

10:04.512 --> 10:07.913
to that great servant's
quarters in the sky.

10:07.915 --> 10:09.381
He won't see sunrise.

10:09.383 --> 10:13.051
We can't give up,
we just can't!

10:13.053 --> 10:15.487
We've come to the limits
of what Western medicine can do.

10:15.489 --> 10:19.357
The only thing that can save him
at this point is love.

10:21.094 --> 10:22.026
Sit.

10:22.028 --> 10:23.895
That's a good boy.

10:23.897 --> 10:25.697
Now up, up, up, up.

10:25.699 --> 10:27.231
Now beg.

10:27.233 --> 10:28.232
Beg.

10:28.234 --> 10:29.934
I would really like
that morsel.

10:29.936 --> 10:32.337
It would temporarily
end this bout of starvation.

10:32.339 --> 10:34.839
Please, I beg of you.

10:34.841 --> 10:36.308
Good boy!

10:38.011 --> 10:39.777
Oh, you've trained him.

10:43.081 --> 10:47.584
Ooh, what is wrong
with this cake?

10:47.586 --> 10:49.987
This is triple berry cake.

10:49.989 --> 10:52.589
Lillian always has
quadruple berry cake

10:52.591 --> 10:54.325
on her birthday.

10:55.994 --> 10:58.295
Oh, my God, Lillian!
That's so gross!

10:59.865 --> 11:02.132
Lillian!

11:02.134 --> 11:04.868
Oh, Lillian, this must be
a nightmare for you.

11:06.103 --> 11:08.839
Oh, relax, everyone, would you?

11:08.841 --> 11:10.441
It's just a birthday cake.

11:10.443 --> 11:13.243
What are we, children?

11:13.245 --> 11:16.246
I'd recognize that
breezy tune anywhere.

11:16.248 --> 11:20.317
Seems as though someone
just got fingered.

11:25.723 --> 11:27.657
What is it, Garfield?

11:27.659 --> 11:29.392
Yes.

11:29.394 --> 11:32.428
I was wondering if maybe...

11:32.430 --> 11:36.699
we would go downstairs
and say something nice

11:36.701 --> 11:40.302
to Peepers.

11:40.304 --> 11:42.271
He needs love.

11:43.907 --> 11:45.574
What in the hell of all shits

11:45.576 --> 11:47.476
are you blathering on about?

11:47.478 --> 11:49.611
The servants'
quarters on Lillian's birthday?

11:49.613 --> 11:50.880
I don't think so.

11:50.882 --> 11:52.181
You are this close to losing

11:52.183 --> 11:53.715
your ball-washing
privileges.

11:53.717 --> 11:54.783
I...

11:54.785 --> 11:56.385
- Shoo!
- Yes.

11:59.089 --> 12:01.723
What a great family.

12:01.725 --> 12:04.559
You know what?

12:04.561 --> 12:05.927
I wasn't gonna mention this,

12:05.929 --> 12:08.764
but I have a very lucrative,

12:08.766 --> 12:10.932
no-fail investment
opportunity

12:10.934 --> 12:13.067
that I think you all
might be interested in.

12:16.707 --> 12:19.173
So... what can be done?

12:19.175 --> 12:20.641
You mean about the bush
or the baby?

12:20.643 --> 12:23.011
I'm just ribbing you.

12:23.013 --> 12:24.812
Well, it depends
what package you want...

12:24.814 --> 12:27.548
the silver, the platinum,
or the platinum plus.

12:27.550 --> 12:29.017
What's the difference?

12:29.019 --> 12:30.551
Ah, they're really
about the same,

12:30.553 --> 12:31.786
except with the platinum plus

12:31.788 --> 12:33.388
I knock you out
with a bag of flour

12:33.390 --> 12:34.755
and wake you up with a hug.

12:34.757 --> 12:38.091
Either way, we're going
to be using this.

12:39.694 --> 12:41.629
Oh, uh...

12:41.631 --> 12:44.832
I can't do this.

12:44.834 --> 12:46.333
Thank you all the same.

12:48.269 --> 12:51.438
The deposit's nonrefundable!

12:51.440 --> 12:53.373
And then those people
get six people to invest,

12:53.375 --> 12:55.708
on top of the other people
who got six people to invest.

12:55.710 --> 12:56.843
And you see,
it works on itself,

12:56.845 --> 12:58.211
and it's flawless.

12:58.213 --> 13:00.180
And I want you all in
on the ground floor.

13:00.182 --> 13:02.682
Well, I think
it sounds brilliant.

13:02.684 --> 13:04.151
Sounds perfectly reasonable
to me.

13:04.153 --> 13:06.153
Let's give him
the entire family fortune.

13:06.155 --> 13:10.490
No, it's impossible.

13:10.492 --> 13:11.958
If six people get
six more to invest,

13:11.960 --> 13:13.225
and those six get six more,

13:13.227 --> 13:14.594
by the 12th level
in the down line,

13:14.596 --> 13:16.329
in this case expressed
as 6 to the 12th power,

13:16.331 --> 13:18.397
it would require
more than 2 billion participants

13:18.399 --> 13:19.499
to sustain itself.

13:19.501 --> 13:21.534
It's like one
of those pointy circles.

13:21.536 --> 13:23.002
Like, what are those called?

13:23.004 --> 13:24.803
The circles with the points,
where the mummies live?

13:24.805 --> 13:25.938
What is that called?

13:25.940 --> 13:28.774
Mummies are dead, dummy!

13:28.776 --> 13:30.642
They don't live anywhere.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.711
And I won't sit here
and have my integrity

13:32.713 --> 13:34.113
impugned by a woman,

13:34.115 --> 13:36.415
especially a woman
who doesn't understand

13:36.417 --> 13:39.118
the nuances of a pyramid scheme!

13:39.120 --> 13:41.954
And I invented it,
and I'm pretty sure it works!

13:41.956 --> 13:43.455
Tabu and I are out of here!

13:43.457 --> 13:44.857
Come on!

13:47.093 --> 13:48.894
Actually, we don't have

13:48.896 --> 13:49.995
anywhere to stay tonight,

13:49.997 --> 13:51.429
and it's a very large manor.

13:51.431 --> 13:54.132
Mr. Ponzi, you may
take the mauve room,

13:54.134 --> 13:57.502
and Tabu may take
the manure stack.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.139
Oh, it's so obvious
what you're doing!

14:01.141 --> 14:03.108
You just can't stand
to see me less unhappy.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.342
He's a liar, Lillian,

14:04.344 --> 14:05.743
and you're an idiot
for believing him.

14:05.745 --> 14:06.944
Oh, I'm an idiot?

14:06.946 --> 14:08.113
You argue with your reflection.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.347
She's mean sometimes!

14:09.349 --> 14:10.915
Well, your eyes are
so spaced apart,

14:10.917 --> 14:12.384
you look like a hippo
in a dress.

14:12.386 --> 14:14.151
You're only pretty
in Massachusetts!

14:15.855 --> 14:20.925
That's the worst thing
you could ever say to a woman.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.359
And I'm rising above it.

14:43.714 --> 14:45.815
Thank goodness
that's over with.

14:45.817 --> 14:48.818
You have terrible taste in men.

14:52.123 --> 14:53.622
* my instincts, they kick in *

14:53.624 --> 14:56.425
* my grand facade,
soon wilting *

14:56.427 --> 14:58.728
* without my pride, I begin *

14:58.730 --> 15:01.397
* to reach out to ya
from within me *

15:01.399 --> 15:02.965
* baby, in your eyes *

15:02.967 --> 15:05.735
* I see the moon in your eyes *

15:05.737 --> 15:09.204
* darling, in your eyes
I want to swoon *

15:09.206 --> 15:11.073
* in your eyes *

15:11.075 --> 15:13.909
Oh, you've got to be joshing!

15:13.911 --> 15:15.878
* that nobody else can beat *

15:21.684 --> 15:24.353
* in your eyes, in your eyes *

15:31.376 --> 15:33.943
Ah!

15:33.945 --> 15:35.179
Our song!

15:35.181 --> 15:36.680
You remembered.

15:36.682 --> 15:38.582
Run away with me, right now.

15:38.584 --> 15:40.083
I'll make you a princess.

15:40.085 --> 15:42.619
I'll have Tabu sacrificing
yaks in your name.

15:42.621 --> 15:44.020
What about my loveless marriage

15:44.022 --> 15:45.522
and eight non-sons?

15:45.524 --> 15:47.290
They call them daughters
now, Wiener.

15:47.292 --> 15:48.558
It's a whole new world.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.093
We've got to leave
all that behind.

15:50.095 --> 15:51.127
But how can I trust you?

15:51.129 --> 15:52.696
I can't get hurt again.

15:52.698 --> 15:54.463
It takes two people
to leave someone.

15:54.465 --> 15:56.499
You're right.
I'm sorry you left me.

15:56.501 --> 15:58.101
I might be able
to forgive you one day,

15:58.103 --> 16:01.637
if you pledge
your love, vagina,

16:01.639 --> 16:03.539
oh, and one more thing,

16:03.541 --> 16:05.974
a firm guarantee that
your family will invest.

16:05.976 --> 16:08.244
To the love, yes,
and to the vagina, yes.

16:08.246 --> 16:09.612
But to the investing,

16:09.614 --> 16:11.780
you might have
to speak with Papa.

16:11.782 --> 16:16.352
I don't want to make Papa
a princess.

16:16.354 --> 16:17.886
I can't do this.

16:17.888 --> 16:20.923
It was a mistake to come here
in the first place.

16:20.925 --> 16:22.557
Good-bye, Lillian.

16:22.559 --> 16:24.626
Well, there's always
Daddy's war bonds.

16:27.563 --> 16:28.731
He keeps them upstairs

16:28.733 --> 16:30.699
in his bottom
right-hand desk drawer.

16:30.701 --> 16:33.535
But it's not much,
only a million dollars.

16:33.537 --> 16:35.037
That's my Wiener.

16:35.039 --> 16:37.004
My beautiful, beautiful Wiener!

16:37.006 --> 16:40.308
Goddamn, I love
my gorgeous Wiener!

16:40.310 --> 16:41.576
I'll grab Tabu and the bonds.

16:41.578 --> 16:42.777
You go get your things.

16:42.779 --> 16:44.846
Meet me back here
in 20 minutes.

16:44.848 --> 16:46.848
Let's make it 30, to be safe.

16:48.551 --> 16:50.452
Hello, Peepers.

16:50.454 --> 16:51.886
It's Dodo...

16:51.888 --> 16:55.923
and the whole Bellacourt family.

16:55.925 --> 17:01.328
Peepers, you are the best
butler we ever had.

17:01.330 --> 17:03.297
We love you.

17:03.299 --> 17:07.801
I love you.

17:14.277 --> 17:16.877
Oh, Peepers.

17:16.878 --> 17:18.244
You're home.

17:18.247 --> 17:19.346
Dodo...

17:19.348 --> 17:22.282
Oh... oh...

17:22.285 --> 17:25.117
Oh, my special boy is awake.

17:25.119 --> 17:29.923
Dodo, Dodo...

17:29.925 --> 17:31.691
Dodo...

17:34.929 --> 17:36.696
Dodo...

17:37.765 --> 17:39.599
- Dodo.
- Blanche?

17:39.601 --> 17:41.401
Blanche!

17:49.777 --> 17:52.077
Garfield, set the lubrication
by the furnace.

17:52.079 --> 17:53.579
No, it's me, Lillian.

17:53.581 --> 17:55.548
What do you want?
I'm busy.

17:55.550 --> 17:56.816
Well, I wanted to say
I'm not sorry,

17:56.818 --> 17:58.517
and I'm running away
with Ponzi.

17:58.519 --> 17:59.985
No, Lillian, don't do it.

17:59.987 --> 18:01.420
I know he's handsome,
and he's thoughtful,

18:01.422 --> 18:03.322
and he could surely
make you happier

18:03.324 --> 18:06.292
than you are here, but...

18:06.294 --> 18:07.827
I can't think of a "but."

18:07.829 --> 18:08.760
You should go.

18:08.762 --> 18:10.529
Great.
I'm happy for you.

18:10.531 --> 18:12.564
- Go!
- I will!

18:33.518 --> 18:34.652
He's not coming back.

18:34.654 --> 18:35.987
Oh, he's coming back.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.922
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

18:37.924 --> 18:40.158
No, he's not.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.893
He's not coming back.

18:45.564 --> 18:47.665
You are probably
asking yourself,

18:47.667 --> 18:49.299
why did I do this?

18:49.301 --> 18:51.702
You see, Ponzi was my tormentor.

18:51.704 --> 18:53.937
But then I saw
what a good human was

18:53.939 --> 18:56.139
when I looked into
your giant, vacant eyes,

18:56.141 --> 19:00.378
when I felt the magnetic field
around your perfect breast.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.312
I am ready to give
my life to you.

19:02.314 --> 19:03.647
Whatever you may need,

19:03.649 --> 19:05.582
whether it be
a cold glass of limeade

19:05.584 --> 19:07.450
or the taking of a man's life,

19:07.452 --> 19:09.086
I am yours,

19:09.088 --> 19:10.687
forever.

19:10.689 --> 19:12.589
And you too, Wiener.

19:16.995 --> 19:17.995
No, thank you.

19:17.997 --> 19:19.696
Thank you, though.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.667
Lady Dodo,

19:59.669 --> 20:02.469
I wanted to take
this opportunity

20:02.471 --> 20:04.138
to thank you.

20:04.140 --> 20:05.439
For what?

20:05.441 --> 20:07.107
Oh, you know...

20:07.109 --> 20:08.242
for helping me.

20:08.244 --> 20:09.943
I haven't got the faintest idea

20:09.945 --> 20:11.277
what you're talking about.

20:11.279 --> 20:12.412
Ha, yes, of course.

20:12.414 --> 20:14.180
Must keep up appearances.

20:14.182 --> 20:16.650
Is this some form of palsy?

20:18.754 --> 20:22.221
You're two seconds
from being fired.

20:22.223 --> 20:23.590
Of course, Lady Dodo.

20:23.592 --> 20:24.591
Garfield!

20:24.593 --> 20:25.992
Are you on a vacation?

20:25.994 --> 20:27.793
Are we under a coconut fire?

20:27.795 --> 20:29.095
No, no,
I was just...

20:29.097 --> 20:31.764
You're just a vile,
useless walking fern.

20:31.766 --> 20:33.132
Now, get to work

20:33.134 --> 20:34.867
before I return you
to the orphanage

20:34.869 --> 20:37.603
I selected you from
20 years ago.

20:37.605 --> 20:39.072
Yes.
