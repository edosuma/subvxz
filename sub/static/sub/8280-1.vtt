00:26.162 --> 00:29.359
<i>If you're troubled
by something mysterious</i>

00:29.465 --> 00:31.865
<i>or a problem that's hard to solve,</i>

00:31.968 --> 00:35.404
<i>there's a place you can go
where you always find help.</i>

00:35.471 --> 00:37.530
<i>You just need to look for it.</i>

00:56.419 --> 00:57.886
Not again.

00:58.955 --> 01:01.651
- Aren't you up yet?
- I'm up. I'm up.

01:10.867 --> 01:11.891
Whatever.

01:15.071 --> 01:16.129
Hey, Mom.

01:16.205 --> 01:19.402
Really, why do you bother
setting an alarm clock?

01:20.543 --> 01:21.874
Gotta go.

01:21.978 --> 01:24.674
Too bad you don't have time to eat.

01:24.747 --> 01:28.877
Mmm, mmm. It's delicious.

01:30.219 --> 01:33.655
- That's just mean.
- Have a nice day.

01:44.901 --> 01:45.925
Oh!

01:56.345 --> 01:58.313
Oh, my shoe.

02:00.383 --> 02:02.476
Oh. Excuse me?

02:08.491 --> 02:14.760
The kingdom is gone,
yet the mountains and rivers remain.

02:14.830 --> 02:19.028
And the castle is draped
in the vivid green of spring.

02:19.101 --> 02:23.037
Haru, we can see you sneaking in,
so just get to your seat, please.

02:23.139 --> 02:25.198
Yes, sir.

02:26.375 --> 02:28.468
Busted.

02:53.866 --> 02:55.595
Sorry.

03:02.207 --> 03:04.971
It's not fair.
First I have a bad morning,

03:05.043 --> 03:07.204
then everyone laughs at me in class.

03:07.312 --> 03:10.907
- Even Machida was laughing, wasn't he?
- Yeah, pretty hard.

03:10.982 --> 03:15.351
Why me? Why are all these bad things
happening to me?

03:15.420 --> 03:18.947
Hm, maybe it's some kind
of weird omen, Haru.

03:19.090 --> 03:22.355
Like your life is
gonna get a whole lot worse real soon.

03:22.460 --> 03:24.519
Thanks. That helps a lot.

03:32.938 --> 03:34.701
That's odd. Never seen him.

03:37.542 --> 03:41.774
- Why worry about what Machida thinks?
- I just think he's so cool.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.747
- Tell him.
- What if he has a girlfriend?

03:44.849 --> 03:47.477
He does. A freshman. Really cute.

03:47.619 --> 03:49.780
Then why tell me to flirt with him?

03:49.888 --> 03:52.652
I want a good laugh
when he blows you off.

03:52.724 --> 03:55.420
- You are terrible.
- Machida's not that cool.

03:55.493 --> 03:58.394
- My Tsuge is much cooler and...
- Careful.

04:05.770 --> 04:09.137
- What was that?
- Cat burglar.

04:16.248 --> 04:18.079
Where's he going?

04:18.149 --> 04:20.640
Hey, dumb cat! You'll get killed!

04:25.223 --> 04:29.182
- Oh well, it's just a cat.
- This doesn't look so good.

04:36.434 --> 04:38.299
Ah! What is he doing?

04:38.403 --> 04:40.667
Haru, don't!

04:40.739 --> 04:42.206
I should be there in...

04:47.445 --> 04:48.844
No way. What a catch!

04:56.521 --> 04:58.614
Hey, you stupid jerk!

05:05.063 --> 05:07.156
Oh, cat, that was close.

05:21.846 --> 05:26.874
That was quite a brave act
you performed. I am extremely grateful.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.181
I hope you are not injured.

05:31.790 --> 05:35.317
I don't mean to be rude,
but I'm in a hurry.

05:35.427 --> 05:39.488
- I'll return to thank you properly.
- Uh, that's okay.

05:43.068 --> 05:45.161
Haru!

05:50.642 --> 05:52.701
Well, so much for your stick,

05:52.777 --> 05:56.076
but at least
you rescued that stupid cat.

05:56.214 --> 05:57.909
- It talked.
- What?

05:57.982 --> 05:59.916
That cat spoke to me.

06:01.586 --> 06:04.248
Hey, did you hit your head?

06:11.529 --> 06:14.089
Mom, I'm home.

06:14.999 --> 06:17.433
Watch it! Quilt on the floor.

06:17.502 --> 06:21.029
Oh my, this pattern's a disaster.

06:21.106 --> 06:24.200
Could you make dinner tonight?

06:24.309 --> 06:25.970
- Hey, Mom?
- Hm-mm.

06:26.044 --> 06:27.807
Do you think cats can talk?

06:30.248 --> 06:32.512
Sure. Why not?

06:36.688 --> 06:38.280
What?

06:38.390 --> 06:43.521
You've asked me that question before
when you were a little girl.

06:43.628 --> 06:46.688
You said, "Mommy,
did you know I can talk to cats?"

06:46.798 --> 06:50.393
- I said that?
- Yes. You don't remember?

07:10.088 --> 07:12.181
Hmm?

07:13.224 --> 07:14.919
Hey, what's wrong?

07:17.028 --> 07:19.622
Oh, you're pretty hungry, huh?

07:19.731 --> 07:22.131
Do you like fish?

07:22.233 --> 07:25.293
They're really good. Here, try some.

07:26.871 --> 07:30.068
You're really dirty, kitty.

07:30.141 --> 07:33.201
Do you like the fish?

07:33.278 --> 07:35.337
See. I told you.

07:36.147 --> 07:38.308
You want some more?

07:38.416 --> 07:40.509
Okay, you can have them all.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.825
No, you don't need to
do anything for me.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.725
- Haru.
- Mommy!

07:53.164 --> 07:57.498
- What were you doing over there?
- I was talking with the kitten.

07:59.003 --> 08:01.665
So I asked you
what the kitten said to you.

08:01.739 --> 08:03.536
And do you know what you said?

08:03.608 --> 08:07.567
You said the kitten told you
that life is tough.

08:07.645 --> 08:09.738
I thought it was so adorable.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.485
So it looks like that actually happened.

08:20.592 --> 08:24.528
Let's forget about it, go to sleep,
and get up in time for breakfast.

08:46.150 --> 08:49.313
Huh?

10:19.210 --> 10:20.336
Uh...

10:24.048 --> 10:26.073
Uh, come over here.

10:29.787 --> 10:32.915
- Hm?
- Mm-mm. A bit closer.

10:39.597 --> 10:44.534
Please allow me to present our wise
and incredibly magnificent ruler,

10:44.602 --> 10:48.038
King of Cat Kingdom, the Cat King.

10:52.944 --> 10:55.037
That's me, babe.

10:56.014 --> 10:59.245
The cat whose life
you saved today was none other

10:59.317 --> 11:02.411
than the king's only son Prince Lune.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.579
Given the magnitude of the matter,

11:04.656 --> 11:09.093
the king would like to express
his gratitude to you in his own words.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.355
Oh.

11:16.234 --> 11:18.293
Thanks a lot, babe.

11:20.405 --> 11:23.533
A list of what you shall receive.

11:28.846 --> 11:32.213
Starting tomorrow,
that marvelous array of gifts

11:32.316 --> 11:34.807
will be showered upon you.

11:37.555 --> 11:39.887
- Thank you.
- Mmmm.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.217
<i>Ciao, babe.</i>

12:17.295 --> 12:19.195
Just a dream.

12:22.166 --> 12:26.068
No way. You don't know
anything about this at all?

12:27.605 --> 12:29.903
I have no idea. I just woke up.

12:30.007 --> 12:32.100
Then where did these come from?

12:38.916 --> 12:41.043
Haru, get down here!

12:41.152 --> 12:44.747
Look at this.
What has happened to our yard?

12:45.990 --> 12:48.117
Those look like cat tails.

12:48.259 --> 12:52.025
Okay. I must be working too hard.
I'm going back to bed.

13:05.276 --> 13:07.972
Leave me alone!
Stupid cats!

13:08.613 --> 13:09.671
Huh?

13:09.747 --> 13:12.443
Hey, what do I do
with all the lacrosse sticks?

13:12.517 --> 13:14.610
Hi, guys. Gotta run.

13:18.322 --> 13:21.849
- What is that about?
- Does she have catnip on her?

13:21.926 --> 13:24.759
- Catnip? What for?
- Beats me.

13:26.297 --> 13:28.822
No pets on school property, young lady.

13:28.966 --> 13:31.196
No! They're not mine!

13:33.805 --> 13:35.670
What's going on?

13:37.909 --> 13:39.501
Huh?

14:02.133 --> 14:06.331
So it wasn't a dream. Those cats
from last night must be behind this.

14:06.404 --> 14:09.999
I'm starting to think
it was a big mistake to save that cat.

14:10.107 --> 14:11.631
Huh?

14:13.811 --> 14:16.837
Stick, cat tails, catnip, mice...

14:19.083 --> 14:21.517
- Haru?
- What?

14:21.619 --> 14:23.985
Did you get the catnip off you?

14:24.055 --> 14:28.389
Oh, yes. Someone stuck some
in my pockets but it's gone now.

14:28.459 --> 14:30.859
Wow, that's weird.

14:32.296 --> 14:34.890
Okay, I've got a big favor to ask you.

14:34.966 --> 14:37.059
Can you do my cleanup duty today?

14:37.168 --> 14:41.662
Tsuge's got a big game and if
I don't leave after class, I'll miss it.

14:41.772 --> 14:43.239
Please, please, please.

14:43.307 --> 14:46.071
Oh, Tsuge.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.701
Yeah, sure, I'll do it.

14:47.778 --> 14:50.076
Thanks, Haru. You're a lifesaver.

14:59.857 --> 15:02.223
Come on, Tsuge. Go!

15:03.394 --> 15:05.157
Yeah!

15:05.263 --> 15:07.561
Yes! He's so cool!

15:33.224 --> 15:35.158
Careful. Watch your step.

15:35.259 --> 15:36.624
Thanks.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.488
Ah... Hurt...

15:41.165 --> 15:43.258
Oh, look at the mess I made.

15:45.002 --> 15:46.697
Oh, I missed.

15:59.050 --> 16:01.518
Who do I think I'm fooling anyway?

16:01.585 --> 16:03.678
There she is. Miss Haru! Miss Haru!

16:12.964 --> 16:14.329
Oh...

16:14.398 --> 16:17.265
You cats just never let up!

16:17.335 --> 16:19.803
Well, we're so glad that you're pleased.

16:19.904 --> 16:21.030
No, I'm not.

16:21.105 --> 16:25.098
How can that be? The whole kingdom
is working to make you happy.

16:25.209 --> 16:28.144
And we all agreed
that the gifts were fabulous.

16:28.212 --> 16:31.147
Don't you cats know anything?
I hate mice.

16:31.282 --> 16:34.740
I'm allergic to cat tails
and catnip does nothing for me.

16:34.852 --> 16:37.218
Oh, my my my my my.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.722
I guess we made a little mistake.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.190
Well, this is embarrassing.

16:42.259 --> 16:45.387
The king will not be happy
when he hears about this.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.954
I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings?

16:48.065 --> 16:50.693
I overreacted, didn't I?

16:50.835 --> 16:56.068
I've just been on edge recently.
Things have not been going well for me.

16:56.140 --> 17:00.668
- What kind of things?
- I don't know. Everything, you name it.

17:00.745 --> 17:02.440
I'm shocked to hear this.

17:02.546 --> 17:07.108
But I suppose even pretty girls like you
have problems like everyone else.

17:07.218 --> 17:11.984
- What? Stop. That's enough.
- It is nowhere near enough.

17:12.056 --> 17:16.685
The Kingdom of Cats has vowed not to
rest until you are completely satisfied.

17:16.794 --> 17:19.991
- There's more?
- Yes.

17:20.064 --> 17:24.660
How would you like to have a private
tour of the spectacular Kingdom of Cats?

17:24.769 --> 17:26.464
Are you serious?

17:26.569 --> 17:29.698
I'm sure you'll love it there.
It's a marvelous place.

17:29.807 --> 17:31.798
Great food, fabulous scenery

17:31.909 --> 17:37.006
and the entire cat kingdom
is ready to welcome you.

17:37.081 --> 17:40.983
And that's not all.
The king is so taken with you,

17:41.052 --> 17:44.818
he has awarded you the most
valuable gift in the cat kingdom.

17:44.922 --> 17:49.018
You will become his daughter-in-law
and marry Prince Lune.

17:49.126 --> 17:50.889
Huh?

17:50.995 --> 17:53.862
Don't think
about trying to pull that one on me.

17:53.964 --> 17:56.398
There is no way I can marry a cat.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.731
The royal family
thinks you're good enough

17:59.837 --> 18:02.601
and the prince is so cool.

18:03.441 --> 18:05.966
- He's cool?
- Hm-mm.

18:15.653 --> 18:16.677
Hmm...

18:16.754 --> 18:20.918
Who knows? Maybe I'd fit in better
with a bunch of cats.

18:21.992 --> 18:24.483
You get to lie around all day,
don't you?

18:24.595 --> 18:28.793
- But of course.
- Eat all the food you want,

18:28.866 --> 18:33.394
take naps in the sun,
forget about all your problems.

18:33.471 --> 18:37.532
But me getting married to a cat prince,
that's just ridiculous.

18:37.641 --> 18:39.575
Right, cat?

18:39.677 --> 18:42.407
Fantastic.
We'll collect you tonight, then.

18:43.681 --> 18:46.206
No, I didn't agree to that.
Hey, wait!

18:48.486 --> 18:50.579
Ow!

18:50.688 --> 18:52.747
Oh, I hurt.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.517
Okay, think, Haru.

18:56.127 --> 18:58.220
You gotta do something about this.

18:58.462 --> 19:01.295
What can I do?
Those cats are relentless.

19:01.365 --> 19:05.358
They'll find a way to kidnap me
and I'll have to marry a cat.

19:05.436 --> 19:08.303
I now pronounce you cat and wife.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.498
You may kiss the bride.

19:11.175 --> 19:13.234
No, no, I don't want to marry a cat!

19:16.046 --> 19:18.105
<i>Haru. Haru.</i>

19:19.550 --> 19:20.949
What was that?

19:21.051 --> 19:24.714
<i>Haru, go to the Cat Bureau.
Find the Cat Bureau.</i>

19:26.390 --> 19:30.850
Hey, come on. Who's there?
Who's messing with me now?

19:30.928 --> 19:34.989
<i>They will help you there. Look for
a large, white cat at the crossroads.</i>

19:35.366 --> 19:38.062
<i>He will show you the way.</i>

19:38.135 --> 19:40.228
A cat at a crossroad?

19:40.337 --> 19:43.932
<i>Find the white cat
and go to the Cat Bureau, Haru.</i>

19:44.074 --> 19:46.167
<i>You'll need their help.</i>

20:02.793 --> 20:04.761
Find the Cat Bureau.

20:06.931 --> 20:08.796
Never heard of a Cat Bureau.

20:10.467 --> 20:12.935
Look for a large, white cat...

20:14.405 --> 20:19.001
At least it was a pleasant voice.
Maybe the white cat will be nice, too.

20:20.211 --> 20:24.477
That was one long, weird day.
I definitely need a break.

20:27.585 --> 20:29.644
What in the heck was that?

20:30.988 --> 20:34.924
Hey, you big fatso.
You cats keep freaking me out.

20:35.626 --> 20:38.424
Are you the big, white cat? Are you?

20:39.797 --> 20:43.324
Listen, cat.
I need to know where the Cat Bureau is.

20:46.403 --> 20:48.337
A voice told me to ask you.

20:54.044 --> 20:58.071
Must have the wrong person.
I mean cat. I have the wrong cat.

20:58.182 --> 21:00.082
Sorry I sat on you.

21:01.752 --> 21:04.346
- Wait. I'll show you.
- It's him!

21:07.024 --> 21:09.151
Wait a minute. Slow down.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.775
Isn't there an easier way?

21:37.288 --> 21:39.415
Hey. Hey, come on.

21:39.523 --> 21:42.458
Guess I shouldn't have called him Fatso.

22:32.910 --> 22:34.969
Huh?

22:47.358 --> 22:49.451
Oh...

23:04.174 --> 23:06.267
Wow, this is one weird place.

23:32.069 --> 23:34.264
Excuse me, where's the Cat Bureau?

23:37.674 --> 23:41.007
Hello?
I need some help right now.

23:41.078 --> 23:44.013
I'm gonna get dragged off
to the cat kingdom.

23:59.897 --> 24:02.127
Could this be it?

24:22.152 --> 24:24.245
Enough, Baron. Turn it off.

24:24.388 --> 24:27.380
No one's impressed
with your cheesy light show, okay?

24:53.016 --> 24:55.484
Good evening. Welcome to the Bureau

24:58.889 --> 25:00.982
Wow, you're cool.

25:01.058 --> 25:05.188
Thank you. You're now in a world
quite different from your own.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.490
This is a refuge for creations.

25:07.564 --> 25:11.193
Whenever someone creates something
with all of their heart,

25:11.268 --> 25:14.135
then that creation is given a soul.

25:14.204 --> 25:16.638
Like me and Toto there.

25:28.452 --> 25:29.680
That's... That's...

25:29.753 --> 25:32.847
That is Toto.
A stone statue with a soul.

25:32.923 --> 25:36.222
I see you have a visitor today, Baron.
How unusual.

25:36.293 --> 25:38.989
Indeed. She's quite a fetching one, too.

25:39.096 --> 25:41.462
Did he say Baron?

25:41.532 --> 25:44.000
I am Baron Humbert von Gikkingen.

25:44.134 --> 25:47.103
The artisan who created me
gave me that title.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.104
I'll just call you Baron.

25:49.206 --> 25:54.644
So, you say you're having trouble
with those cats from the cat kingdom.

25:54.745 --> 25:58.579
Yes. Yesterday I saved their prince
from getting hit by a truck,

25:58.649 --> 26:01.447
and now they won't stop
trying to repay me.

26:01.552 --> 26:03.281
- I see.
- Huh!

26:03.353 --> 26:07.653
Serves you right. Thought you'd help
the poor kitty, did you?

26:09.960 --> 26:12.758
You should've minded your own business.

26:12.863 --> 26:14.990
Muta, what's your problem?

26:15.098 --> 26:18.829
This girl saved one of your own kind.
You should be grateful.

26:18.936 --> 26:22.133
Now she's in trouble for it, isn't she?

26:22.205 --> 26:25.333
So she was stupid,
that's all I'm saying.

26:26.843 --> 26:28.834
Where did you find her, Muta?

26:28.946 --> 26:32.609
At the crossroads.
She knew about the Cat Bureau.

26:32.683 --> 26:34.344
Hmm.

26:34.451 --> 26:38.979
A voice told me about it. I don't know
whose voice it was, though.

26:39.089 --> 26:41.114
- A voice?
- You're hearing voices?

26:41.224 --> 26:44.387
Check into a loony bin.
Don't bother us with...

26:45.262 --> 26:48.629
- Knock it off!
- You knock it off. Quit being so catty.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.256
Don't try that again.

26:50.334 --> 26:53.861
You guys, I'll just leave.
I don't want to cause any trouble.

26:53.971 --> 26:55.802
I didn't get your name.

26:55.906 --> 26:58.534
Haru. It's Haru.

26:58.642 --> 27:01.236
Well, Miss Haru,
please step into the Bureau.

27:02.879 --> 27:06.007
- Come along. Don't worry about them.
- Chicken wings!

27:06.083 --> 27:09.541
Can't you tell the difference
between chickens and crows?

27:09.653 --> 27:14.420
- Yes, I'm not the birdbrain here.
- I don't look like a giant marshmallow.

27:14.558 --> 27:17.994
- At least I don't have a bird brain.
- You already said that.

27:18.095 --> 27:23.192
- Go fry yourself, you big chicken.
- You already called me a chicken!

27:27.237 --> 27:29.330
This looks close.

27:30.841 --> 27:34.106
Wow, this place is beautiful.

27:34.177 --> 27:37.305
- Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

27:38.915 --> 27:40.883
Milk with your tea, or lemon?

27:40.984 --> 27:43.077
- Milk, please.
- Good choice.

27:51.194 --> 27:53.890
You have great taste, Baron.

27:53.997 --> 27:56.227
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

27:59.436 --> 28:00.767
How cute.

28:00.837 --> 28:03.635
That's my own personal blend of tea.

28:03.707 --> 28:07.973
It's a little different each time,
so I can't guarantee the taste.

28:09.513 --> 28:11.947
Wow, that's the best tea
I've ever tasted.

28:12.049 --> 28:13.573
Then you're lucky.

28:13.684 --> 28:16.881
Just tastes like boiled grass to me.

28:18.355 --> 28:21.051
Tea is too refined
for your crude taste buds.

28:21.124 --> 28:23.024
At least I don't eat worms.

28:23.093 --> 28:28.759
Muta, have a seat and tell us
what you know about the Kingdom of Cats.

28:28.865 --> 28:30.924
It's a dangerous place.

28:31.034 --> 28:34.526
You shouldn't go there
if you don't believe in yourself.

28:34.604 --> 28:36.037
Good point.

28:36.106 --> 28:38.370
They said not only will they kidnap me,

28:38.475 --> 28:42.036
they're going to force me
to marry Prince Lune.

28:42.112 --> 28:44.444
So, do it. You'll be set for life.

28:44.548 --> 28:47.415
- Are you crazy?
- It might not be all that bad.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.041
That's ridiculous.

28:49.119 --> 28:53.078
- She won't know until she tries it.
- Now, then...

28:54.191 --> 28:58.491
I've always entertained the idea of
paying a visit to the Kingdom of Cats.

28:58.595 --> 29:01.564
- Now is the time.
- Have a nice trip.

29:01.631 --> 29:05.032
- Hope you make it back some day.
- You're coming with me.

29:05.135 --> 29:08.161
Nah, I'll pass.
But thanks for thinking of me.

29:08.271 --> 29:11.206
Baron, you're not going to
take her there, are you?

29:11.274 --> 29:13.299
We can't leave her unprotected.

29:13.410 --> 29:17.710
But if Muta wants to stay here,
he can keep an eye on her.

29:17.781 --> 29:21.717
No way. You can't leave her here.
I'm not baby-sitting.

29:21.785 --> 29:24.754
- Why? Are you busy at the moment?
- Not really.

29:24.855 --> 29:26.322
I'll just go home.

29:26.423 --> 29:28.914
- Hmm?
- What?

29:29.025 --> 29:32.586
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
cause you so much trouble.

29:32.662 --> 29:37.292
Muta's right. It's my fault
for getting involved with those cats.

29:37.367 --> 29:39.767
I'll figure something out.

29:40.637 --> 29:45.131
Well, then, so sorry the Cat Bureau
couldn't be of any help to you.

29:46.977 --> 29:50.140
Ah... All right, all right.

29:51.281 --> 29:53.681
I'll watch the little baby.

29:53.784 --> 29:55.649
Good kitty.

29:55.752 --> 29:58.812
Then it's settled.
You can stay here with Muta.

29:58.889 --> 30:00.083
You sure?

30:00.157 --> 30:04.992
Don't worry about Muta. He complains
a lot but he has a heart of gold.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.084
Hmph!

30:06.663 --> 30:09.325
Hm... I see.

30:09.399 --> 30:11.492
So he's just a big softie.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.330
You could say that.

30:13.403 --> 30:15.462
And this is the thanks I get.

30:15.539 --> 30:19.066
Thank you for your help, Moo-ta.

30:19.176 --> 30:22.839
What? Moo?
Are you saying that I'm a fat cow?

30:22.946 --> 30:26.677
- No, you're just fat.
- I like this girl better every minute.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.182
I'm outta here.

30:28.285 --> 30:32.517
That's too bad. I was just going to
get out some angel fruit cake.

30:32.622 --> 30:35.955
- Where is it?
- It's in the upper-right shelf.

30:36.026 --> 30:37.823
Why didn't you say so?

30:37.894 --> 30:40.727
Our guest
deserves a proper afternoon tea.

30:41.832 --> 30:44.426
This calls
for some of my special mulberries.

30:47.938 --> 30:50.930
You're too much, Baron.
A tea party and everything?

30:51.074 --> 30:55.670
- Anything I can do to help?
- Yes, there is something.

30:56.146 --> 31:00.139
I need you to learn just one thing.
Always believe in yourself.

31:00.217 --> 31:04.620
Do this, and no matter where you are,
you will have nothing to fear.

31:05.755 --> 31:09.156
Baron, give me a hand
with this whipped cream.

31:09.226 --> 31:12.923
- You're going all out.
- Better believe it.

31:14.931 --> 31:17.593
Who knows?
Maybe this is the world I belong in.

31:19.269 --> 31:21.362
Hey, is that Toto?

31:26.343 --> 31:29.574
It's time to go to our kingdom,
Miss Haru.

31:29.679 --> 31:34.480
You again!
No! Hey! Get away from me!

31:38.388 --> 31:40.447
Skip the tea.

31:42.726 --> 31:45.217
Don't let them take me away, please!

31:45.829 --> 31:49.060
Baron,
a bunch of cats are headed this way.

31:49.165 --> 31:51.065
- Oh no.
- A little late, birdbrain.

31:51.134 --> 31:53.898
Toto, give me a lift.

31:57.841 --> 31:59.502
Ouch!

32:00.176 --> 32:02.167
We had a hard time finding you.

32:02.245 --> 32:04.372
- Let me off.
- What?

32:04.447 --> 32:06.915
Careful, Miss Haru.

32:07.017 --> 32:09.850
Stop these cats.
I want off this thing now.

32:09.953 --> 32:14.253
Don't worry. You're just having
pre-wedding jitters, that's all.

32:14.357 --> 32:15.688
No, I'm not!

32:20.063 --> 32:22.623
She could've waited
until after we had cake.

32:22.732 --> 32:24.495
Ow! Quit that!

32:24.968 --> 32:27.163
Let me go. Stop it. It hurts.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.462
They're coming for me.

32:29.539 --> 32:33.236
- I said let me go.
- Okay, Toto. Now!

32:33.310 --> 32:35.210
Wait. I take it back!

32:38.214 --> 32:41.149
Why did you let him fall?
You cats are terrible.

32:41.251 --> 32:43.276
You're gonna regret that.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.348
Muta!

32:45.455 --> 32:47.650
We're over the weight limit.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.653
- Toto.
- I see it.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.178
Let me off this thing!

33:18.788 --> 33:20.312
Outmaneuvered.

33:22.959 --> 33:25.086
- Get above the trees.
- Right.

33:35.205 --> 33:37.298
Now what?

33:41.978 --> 33:44.674
They're riding the wind.
Follow the lights.

33:44.781 --> 33:46.146
Got it.

33:59.329 --> 34:01.388
Oh, that hurt.

34:01.464 --> 34:04.991
Where am I anyway?
I can't see a thing.

34:13.710 --> 34:16.610
Muta. What happened? You're enormous.

34:16.713 --> 34:19.545
No, kiddo. You got smaller.

34:19.649 --> 34:20.672
Hm?

34:21.951 --> 34:23.748
Why's that?

34:23.853 --> 34:25.911
Because we're here, that's why.

34:36.666 --> 34:39.464
That's the Kingdom of Cats?

34:57.387 --> 34:58.877
That's it.

35:22.745 --> 35:25.009
Wow, there are cats all over the place.

35:25.115 --> 35:28.482
What did you expect?
It is their kingdom.

35:28.551 --> 35:30.644
Hey, you!

35:38.128 --> 35:40.961
Ah, it's so relaxing here.

35:41.064 --> 35:44.033
Hey, we have to find
a way out of here fast.

35:44.134 --> 35:46.329
- Relax.
- Listen, kid...

35:46.402 --> 35:49.394
I've never felt so at home in my life.

35:49.472 --> 35:52.873
Hurry.
You've got to get out of here.

35:54.777 --> 35:58.042
You must leave.
You don't belong here.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.241
Wow! You're beautiful.

36:00.350 --> 36:02.750
Everything's better here.
Even the cats.

36:02.852 --> 36:07.448
Quickly. You don't have much time.
Please, Miss Haru, before it's too late.

36:07.524 --> 36:10.516
Wait a minute.
How do you know my name?

36:10.627 --> 36:12.720
Miss Haru! Miss Haru!

36:13.563 --> 36:16.589
- Huh?
- Oh, not him again.

36:16.699 --> 36:19.429
There you are.
I finally found you.

36:21.004 --> 36:24.064
We seemed to have accidentally
dropped you upon entry.

36:24.140 --> 36:27.200
Your fat servant
exceeded our weight limit.

36:27.277 --> 36:29.507
Fat servant?

36:29.579 --> 36:32.207
No, this is Muta. He's a friend.

36:32.282 --> 36:36.742
That's nice. Come on. Everyone's
dying to meet their new princess.

36:36.853 --> 36:39.219
Fat friend, you can come, too.

36:40.023 --> 36:43.789
- I don't know about this.
- The king is waiting in your castle.

36:43.860 --> 36:47.125
- My castle?
- The royal palace.

36:48.064 --> 36:51.227
- My castle?
- Well, soon enough.

36:51.334 --> 36:52.358
Hmm.

36:52.435 --> 36:54.733
Hey, where do you think you're going?

36:54.837 --> 36:58.273
The king's waiting for me.
It's rude not to say hi.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.935
Have you completely lost your mind?

37:01.010 --> 37:03.535
- This way.
- Wait a minute.

37:03.613 --> 37:05.706
Can she come with us?

37:07.383 --> 37:11.080
- Who are you?
- I'm Yuki. I serve at the royal table.

37:11.154 --> 37:13.987
Oh, so you're employed by the king?

37:14.057 --> 37:16.890
She works at the castle.
You'll see her there.

37:16.993 --> 37:19.052
- Come.
- See you soon, Yuki.

37:19.762 --> 37:21.753
Ow, ow, ow! Hey!

37:28.137 --> 37:30.230
Poor Haru.

37:55.565 --> 37:57.897
Ugh, look at that. Creepy.

38:03.973 --> 38:07.704
Mmm, looks good.
My future daughter-in-law.

38:11.447 --> 38:13.608
Hmm.

38:13.683 --> 38:17.517
All right! Think I'll go
and have a look in person.

38:19.889 --> 38:22.881
Hm. Why does that fatso
seem so familiar?

38:36.606 --> 38:39.700
You'll need to change
before meeting the king.

38:39.809 --> 38:41.674
I get new clothes?

38:41.744 --> 38:44.474
- Please wait here, sir.
- I'm the baby-sitter.

38:44.580 --> 38:46.844
- Back off.
- What's your problem?

38:46.949 --> 38:50.077
Help yourself to refreshments
while you wait.

38:50.153 --> 38:52.212
Yeah, okay, I'll wait.

38:58.061 --> 38:59.255
Oh...

38:59.329 --> 39:01.695
Hey, not bad.

39:04.100 --> 39:06.432
Miss Haru, you're so lucky.

39:06.502 --> 39:09.699
Every girl in the cat kingdom
has a crush on Prince Lune.

39:09.806 --> 39:12.536
I'm sure you'll be very happy together.

39:12.642 --> 39:16.703
You think?
No, wait. I don't think I wanna do this.

39:17.680 --> 39:20.581
Wow, don't you look good.

39:20.683 --> 39:23.652
Welcome to the royal family, babe.

39:27.690 --> 39:29.783
Hmm.

39:33.996 --> 39:35.429
Mmm.

39:45.341 --> 39:49.277
- Tell me, who is that cat?
- I believe his name is Muta.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.404
Muta?

39:52.215 --> 39:54.308
Never heard that name.

39:57.086 --> 39:59.953
No match for my stomach.

40:01.224 --> 40:03.317
Hmm...

40:04.761 --> 40:09.892
King, I'm really flattered by all this
but I don't want to get married.

40:09.999 --> 40:13.958
You what? I was told
you had already consented.

40:14.036 --> 40:17.028
She has consented.
That's what I was told.

40:17.341 --> 40:22.074
- What does the prince say?
- He is away on official business.

40:24.181 --> 40:27.378
Look, first of all,
we don't really know each other

40:27.451 --> 40:29.612
and second of all, he's a cat, right?

40:29.720 --> 40:32.154
And I'm not.
So, clearly, I can't marry him.

40:32.255 --> 40:34.348
- Huh?
- Huh?

40:37.227 --> 40:39.491
That has already been taken care of.

40:40.330 --> 40:42.423
You're half cat already.

40:47.938 --> 40:49.599
Oh...

40:49.706 --> 40:52.231
See, Miss Haru?

40:54.544 --> 40:56.637
Look at that. I'm a cat.

41:06.356 --> 41:08.187
Muta!

41:11.294 --> 41:13.387
Muta, what happened?

41:15.032 --> 41:19.662
He had a weakness for catnip jelly.
He saw the bowl and dove right in.

41:19.736 --> 41:24.264
Muta, you weren't supposed to die.
It's all my fault.

41:24.341 --> 41:27.037
Don't leave me like this, Muta.

41:28.078 --> 41:30.308
Time for the celebration.

41:30.414 --> 41:32.348
No, I won't leave him!

41:32.449 --> 41:34.542
Then we'll bring him with us.

41:47.097 --> 41:50.692
- That's Prince Lune's bride.
- She has lovely fur.

41:50.801 --> 41:53.031
And such delicate paws.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.304
I hear you don't care for mice

41:59.376 --> 42:03.574
but I bet you can't resist
my juicy, raw fish, huh?

42:03.680 --> 42:06.308
I'm not sure she's enjoying herself.

42:06.416 --> 42:10.352
- How about some entertainment?
- Excellent suggestion.

42:39.416 --> 42:41.884
- Not entertaining enough.
- Yes, sire.

43:17.154 --> 43:18.644
Next.

43:46.116 --> 43:49.347
Whoever's next better not stink. Got it?

44:08.038 --> 44:11.735
Your Majesty, I promise that I will
make the young lady smile.

44:13.610 --> 44:16.773
- Shall we try him?
- Sure. Why not?

44:20.483 --> 44:22.451
Huh?

44:22.519 --> 44:25.545
Excuse me.
Would you care to dance?

44:26.122 --> 44:28.181
Oh no, I'm a meow-sy dancer.

44:29.392 --> 44:31.485
Now I'm starting to talk like a cat.

44:33.563 --> 44:35.428
Just trust me.

45:20.176 --> 45:23.111
Well, she seems to be entertained now.

45:35.592 --> 45:37.617
<i>What's happening to me?</i>

45:38.461 --> 45:40.691
<i>I've never felt like this before.</i>

45:41.531 --> 45:43.658
<i>Maybe life as a cat wouldn't be so bad.</i>

45:46.236 --> 45:49.672
Careful, Haru. Don't lose yourself.

45:49.739 --> 45:50.899
Huh?

45:51.007 --> 45:53.066
Believe in who you are.

46:00.617 --> 46:03.051
I said so before, didn't I?

46:04.421 --> 46:05.820
Then you must be...

46:09.492 --> 46:11.585
Stop right there, pal!

46:21.171 --> 46:23.935
You're not from my kingdom, are you?

46:24.040 --> 46:26.565
Exactly who are you?

46:28.078 --> 46:31.104
How rude of me.
I should have introduced myself.

46:33.350 --> 46:35.910
I am exactly who I appear to be.

46:42.726 --> 46:46.856
I am Baron Humbert von Gikkingen
and I have come for Haru.

46:46.963 --> 46:48.191
Baron!

46:48.264 --> 46:51.392
- He's so cool.
- He is handsome.

46:51.468 --> 46:53.868
He can't have her. Seize them!

47:08.485 --> 47:09.952
I'm stuffed.

47:11.988 --> 47:14.081
Muta? You're still alive!

47:15.492 --> 47:19.223
- Oh no!
- Give me back my daughter-in-law.

47:19.796 --> 47:22.230
Quickly,
get His Majesty to a safe place.

47:26.436 --> 47:30.395
Emergency exit for all guests
right here, please. Enjoy your day.

47:38.782 --> 47:41.342
Great technique, Muta.

47:41.451 --> 47:43.510
I just lost my balance.

47:45.055 --> 47:47.114
Over here.

47:48.858 --> 47:50.485
Yuki, you're here.

47:50.560 --> 47:53.927
I'm so thankful
you were able to help Miss Haru, Baron.

47:53.997 --> 47:55.487
Do we know each other?

47:55.598 --> 47:58.260
Many of us here
know of you and your bureau.

47:58.334 --> 48:02.896
Yuki, I'm an idiot. I should've left
when you told me to. Now look at me.

48:02.972 --> 48:07.306
If you leave here by dawn,
you can still turn back into a human.

48:07.377 --> 48:08.571
I will?

48:08.645 --> 48:11.011
This will get you outside the castle.

48:11.114 --> 48:14.311
- Perfect.
- Wait. Where's Muta?

48:21.791 --> 48:23.315
Hmm.

48:23.426 --> 48:26.589
He'll be fine.
We just need to get you home.

48:36.673 --> 48:38.402
The back of the castle.

48:38.475 --> 48:41.569
The door to your world
is at the top of that tower.

48:41.678 --> 48:43.805
You've got to be kidding me?

48:43.880 --> 48:47.577
And the only way to get to the tower
is through the king's maze.

48:47.684 --> 48:49.584
Naturally.

48:49.686 --> 48:53.486
Good luck.
And, Baron, take good care of Haru.

48:53.556 --> 48:55.353
Hey, wait.

48:55.425 --> 48:58.952
She's already gone.
I didn't have a chance to thank her.

48:59.062 --> 49:01.758
Haru, does her voice
sound familiar to you?

49:01.865 --> 49:05.858
Is it possible that she told you
to seek help at the Cat Bureau?

49:05.935 --> 49:10.668
<i>Haru, go to the Cat Bureau.
You must find the Cat Bureau.</i>

49:10.740 --> 49:13.436
You're right.
That was her voice.

49:13.510 --> 49:15.944
But why help me?

49:21.050 --> 49:22.381
Ah! Ah! Ah!

49:27.123 --> 49:30.650
Whose idea was it to leave without me?
I nearly got killed.

49:30.760 --> 49:33.388
This is no time for finger pointing.

49:35.632 --> 49:37.725
You're leaving me again?

49:42.438 --> 49:45.771
- Are they going in?
- Yes, they've just begun.

49:45.875 --> 49:47.308
Purr-fect.

49:47.410 --> 49:50.106
No one's ever come out alive,
have they?

49:50.180 --> 49:53.115
We can watch them go nuts
from over here.

49:56.653 --> 49:59.645
- Hurry, we don't have much time.
- It's still noon.

49:59.756 --> 50:04.022
- It's always noon here.
- What do you mean?

50:04.127 --> 50:09.326
- At home, it's already after midnight.
- What? We've got to go faster.

50:11.634 --> 50:12.828
Where do we go?

50:15.471 --> 50:16.938
They're lost already?

50:17.006 --> 50:19.975
They're doing worse
than most of our victims.

50:20.310 --> 50:21.641
Pleased, Your Majesty?

50:22.712 --> 50:24.771
Feeling good, babe.

50:24.847 --> 50:27.077
- Where are the guards?
- Right there.

50:27.150 --> 50:29.209
Hut, hut, hut, hut...

50:30.019 --> 50:33.955
Let's start with this path. If we're
methodical, we'll find our way.

50:34.023 --> 50:37.584
Keep your eye on the tower.
That will allow us to stay oriented.

50:37.660 --> 50:39.491
Good idea.

50:39.596 --> 50:41.086
Muta, you're cheating.

50:41.164 --> 50:44.133
Gimme a break.
You think I'll get in trouble?

50:45.468 --> 50:47.436
He's cheating.

50:47.503 --> 50:50.370
She's gonna rub this in my face,
isn't she?

50:52.442 --> 50:55.411
Let's get out of here
while Muta keeps them occupied.

50:55.545 --> 50:58.139
Again, I'm tricked into being bait.

51:12.161 --> 51:14.254
Stay behind me, Haru.

51:29.345 --> 51:30.903
Wow!

51:31.014 --> 51:32.743
Oh, how's your cane?

51:32.815 --> 51:36.251
Bent, but it's about time
for a new one anyway.

51:36.319 --> 51:38.378
I never knew they were so useful.

51:45.828 --> 51:47.921
Nice shot, sire.

51:52.735 --> 51:55.135
- Oh no, you hit one of ours.
- I did?

51:55.204 --> 51:59.334
- Your Majesty, how could you?
- Let's keep that between us.

51:59.409 --> 52:03.004
Excuse me,
but I think there's a bit of a problem.

52:03.146 --> 52:06.877
- Our guards are scattered.
- Don't tell me they're lost, too?

52:07.083 --> 52:09.176
Where's my princess?

52:09.519 --> 52:12.215
She's already halfway through.

52:14.257 --> 52:16.157
- Hey!
- You found us.

52:16.225 --> 52:19.388
- What's that way like?
- Just dead ends.

52:36.079 --> 52:38.206
Now this is more like it, babe.

52:39.949 --> 52:43.851
Hm, another dead end.
My, my, this is getting interesting.

52:44.887 --> 52:47.253
Two rights and a left...

52:47.357 --> 52:50.155
Wait a minute,
I know there wasn't a wall here.

52:50.226 --> 52:54.390
- Your brain's overheating.
- We just walked through here, Muta.

52:54.497 --> 52:57.227
What, walls have legs?

53:01.471 --> 53:04.235
She's right, Muta.
This wall is fake.

53:15.718 --> 53:17.777
- Told you.
- Good work, Haru.

53:17.854 --> 53:19.754
All right, fine, good work.

53:21.124 --> 53:25.390
How stupid do you have to be
to line up like dominoes?

53:28.998 --> 53:33.128
- Princess!
- Wait. It's not safe, Your Majesty.

53:41.144 --> 53:43.374
Go ahead. I'll catch up to you.

53:45.348 --> 53:47.441
Oh!

53:48.284 --> 53:49.512
What a show-off.

53:51.154 --> 53:53.088
- I can walk.
- Don't worry.

54:08.237 --> 54:10.330
Hmm?

54:12.375 --> 54:14.707
Your Majesty!
This is very dangerous.

54:14.777 --> 54:16.244
I can't let them escape.

54:16.679 --> 54:21.514
You'll never reach them in time.
Besides, we have guards in the tower.

54:23.553 --> 54:25.282
Why didn't you say so?

54:32.328 --> 54:34.694
Toast.

54:38.634 --> 54:39.862
Whoa!

54:46.476 --> 54:50.936
- I'll have a word with the contractors.
- It's too late for that.

54:51.914 --> 54:54.747
We'll have to use the detonator.

54:54.817 --> 54:57.342
Not that, I beg of you, sire.

54:57.453 --> 55:00.251
Think of what it will do
to your approval ratings.

55:00.389 --> 55:03.324
- Button.
- I must have left it in the castle.

55:03.392 --> 55:04.552
Look what I found.

55:04.660 --> 55:06.719
No! Oh! No!

55:08.798 --> 55:11.562
Hey, we made it to the top.

55:11.634 --> 55:13.727
Not much further now.

55:15.538 --> 55:17.597
Bye-bye, tower.

55:22.912 --> 55:24.777
- Baron!
- Brace yourselves.

55:41.297 --> 55:44.061
Excellent explosion, Your Majesty.

55:44.667 --> 55:46.726
Let's go.

55:49.405 --> 55:52.499
You've got to be kidding.
We're back where we started.

55:52.608 --> 55:55.372
Now what do we do?
Just stand here?

55:55.444 --> 55:56.934
Nothing else we can do.

55:57.113 --> 55:59.479
Hut, hut, hut, hut...

55:59.582 --> 56:01.846
Quick, quick! Get 'em! Get 'em!

56:03.619 --> 56:06.952
Baron, nice to see you again.

56:07.023 --> 56:10.481
Princess, would you please
accompany me back to the castle?

56:12.161 --> 56:14.254
Being a cat's not so bad.

56:14.330 --> 56:17.231
Do I have to learn to eat mice?

56:17.300 --> 56:19.996
Perhaps you shouldn't give up
quite yet, Haru.

56:36.452 --> 56:39.421
What in the world has Father done now?

56:39.488 --> 56:41.581
Father!

56:42.491 --> 56:45.654
Lune? You're back already?

56:46.362 --> 56:48.626
The prince is here. Line up!

56:48.698 --> 56:50.393
It's the prince?

56:56.038 --> 56:58.939
Yuki sent a message
saying it was urgent I return.

56:59.008 --> 57:01.636
Perhaps you'd like to tell me
what's going on?

57:02.144 --> 57:04.442
Miss Haru!

57:04.513 --> 57:07.346
- Yuki, you're here.
- I'm glad Lune made it in time.

57:07.416 --> 57:10.078
I just wanted to repay
the girl who rescued you.

57:10.152 --> 57:12.985
And I thought, just maybe,
you would be happy

57:13.055 --> 57:16.684
to have a good-looking girl like Haru
for a bride.

57:16.792 --> 57:21.058
I have already chosen my bride.
I have decided to marry Yuki.

57:23.599 --> 57:25.260
That thing?

57:25.368 --> 57:28.531
- Guess it was a surprise.
- I like this prince.

57:33.843 --> 57:38.075
This is for you. I traveled
to your old home to get these.

57:44.353 --> 57:47.083
I haven't had these in years.

57:47.189 --> 57:50.647
Wow.
I used to love those when I was a kid.

57:50.793 --> 57:56.629
I know. You fed me a whole box of these
when I was just a stray.

57:56.699 --> 57:59.259
That filthy little kitten was you?

57:59.368 --> 58:02.804
You're so beautiful now,
I never would have recognized you.

58:02.938 --> 58:07.307
Yuki, will you accept these crackers
as a symbol of my love for you

58:07.376 --> 58:09.674
for as long
as our nine lives shall last?

58:11.614 --> 58:14.014
So these crackers mean that

58:14.083 --> 58:16.813
you can marry the prince instead of me!

58:18.721 --> 58:21.815
I'm so happy for you.

58:21.891 --> 58:23.756
Thank you, Haru.

58:23.826 --> 58:26.386
Thank you for feeding me
when I was a kitten.

58:26.462 --> 58:28.828
Without you
I might not be alive today.

58:28.931 --> 58:32.367
You're the girl with the fish crackers
Yuki told me about.

58:32.435 --> 58:35.962
And you also rescued me
when I nearly got killed by a truck.

58:36.072 --> 58:40.270
We both owe you our lives, Haru.
What can we do to repay you?

58:40.342 --> 58:44.301
You don't have to repay me.
I'm just glad things turned out so well.

58:44.380 --> 58:47.008
I guess I did the right thing after all.

58:51.887 --> 58:54.151
This is all very moving.

58:54.256 --> 58:57.282
I had no idea
you had a bride in mind already.

58:57.359 --> 59:00.021
You should've told me.

59:00.096 --> 59:03.293
Poor Haru.
You must feel like such a loser.

59:03.399 --> 59:05.663
- Not really.
- I'm sure you do.

59:05.735 --> 59:09.262
So, I have a great idea.
You should marry me instead.

59:10.206 --> 59:15.769
I'll get you some fish, too, as a symbol
of my undying love and all that.

59:15.845 --> 59:16.869
So?

59:16.979 --> 59:20.380
That's very generous,
but I just want to be myself.

59:20.449 --> 59:23.350
I'll change you back if you marry me.

59:23.452 --> 59:24.476
Hm?

59:24.587 --> 59:26.987
I've had just about enough of you.

59:29.158 --> 59:34.118
Nobody who decided who I am but me,
and there's no way I'd ever marry you.

59:37.299 --> 59:38.493
Was that a no?

59:41.036 --> 59:44.028
So you're not ready
to get hitched then, huh, kid?

59:45.674 --> 59:46.698
Not a chance.

59:46.809 --> 59:49.801
I respect a woman
who stands up for herself.

59:49.912 --> 59:53.370
Even if she does stick her nose
in other people's business.

59:53.482 --> 59:56.246
So I, Renaldo Moon, will defend her.

59:56.318 --> 59:58.786
- Renaldo?
- Renaldo Moon?

59:58.854 --> 01:00:02.346
- The Renaldo Moon?
- So that's who he is.

01:00:02.424 --> 01:00:04.654
- Who?
- How could you have forgotten?

01:00:04.727 --> 01:00:09.027
He's such a notorious criminal,
his story is written on our walls.

01:00:09.098 --> 01:00:12.033
Years back,
an enormous white cat appeared,

01:00:12.134 --> 01:00:15.160
devoured all the fish in the lake
and then ran off.

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:18.968
He called himself Renaldo Moon.

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:22.475
Did you really do that, Muta?
That's disgusting.

01:00:22.545 --> 01:00:25.378
And this time
I'll eat the entire castle.

01:00:26.448 --> 01:00:29.440
Hurry! Get His Majesty to safety, now!

01:00:34.623 --> 01:00:36.682
Protect Haru from the king.

01:00:37.059 --> 01:00:39.857
Yes, sir.
Cat guard, advance.

01:00:41.997 --> 01:00:44.363
Oh, you traitor.

01:00:44.466 --> 01:00:46.457
Please, sire, it's not safe.

01:00:46.602 --> 01:00:50.265
Take Miss Haru to the exit. I'll hold
back the king as long as I can.

01:00:50.406 --> 01:00:51.873
The tower collapsed.

01:00:51.941 --> 01:00:54.671
It's all right, the exit is still there.

01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:03.581
- The sky.
- Oh no, the sun's rising.

01:01:03.652 --> 01:01:05.745
I'll get her to the exit.

01:01:11.193 --> 01:01:13.320
- Nice.
- Run, Haru. Hurry.

01:01:13.462 --> 01:01:15.157
Good luck, and thank you.

01:01:15.865 --> 01:01:17.958
Mm-hm.

01:01:22.004 --> 01:01:24.370
<i>Goodbye, Yuki.</i>

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.704
<i>I wasn't wrong to save a cat.</i>

01:01:26.775 --> 01:01:30.142
<i>No matter what happens,
I believe in my decision.</i>

01:01:30.246 --> 01:01:31.713
<i>I believe.</i>

01:01:32.514 --> 01:01:33.981
<i>I believe.</i>

01:01:38.387 --> 01:01:40.480
- I'll hold them off.
- Thanks, Muta.

01:01:41.657 --> 01:01:44.990
- Where's the king?
- Up there.

01:01:45.094 --> 01:01:47.426
Father, you'll hurt yourself.
Get down.

01:01:47.696 --> 01:01:51.393
- Has he lost his mind?
- I'll find a way to get him down.

01:02:05.814 --> 01:02:08.408
Fight like a cat, you chicken!

01:02:08.717 --> 01:02:10.184
With pleasure.

01:02:10.286 --> 01:02:12.652
- Need help?
- Take care of Haru.

01:02:12.721 --> 01:02:13.779
You got it.

01:03:00.436 --> 01:03:02.495
I win, King.

01:03:03.272 --> 01:03:05.706
How embarrassing.

01:03:15.818 --> 01:03:19.083
I heard rumors
about a nosy cat figurine

01:03:19.154 --> 01:03:21.714
who likes to help others
with their problems.

01:03:21.824 --> 01:03:25.920
I assumed you'd just be a kitschy
knick-knack that collected dust.

01:03:26.028 --> 01:03:30.931
Had I known you were this good, I would
have asked you to come and work for me.

01:03:33.369 --> 01:03:36.770
I prefer a life of sticking my nose
in other's problems.

01:03:39.041 --> 01:03:41.134
Where am I?

01:03:45.047 --> 01:03:47.106
What have you done?

01:03:48.884 --> 01:03:51.216
I didn't do anything.

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:53.948
The tower
is hundreds of feet shorter now.

01:03:54.023 --> 01:03:57.720
I wouldn't be surprised
if the exit had moved as well.

01:04:04.533 --> 01:04:07.593
- Oh no, the exit moved!
- We should have foreseen this.

01:04:07.703 --> 01:04:10.797
But, look, she's not a cat any more.

01:04:19.381 --> 01:04:20.780
Help me!

01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:23.543
I'm going to fall.

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:27.313
I'm going!

01:04:27.623 --> 01:04:29.488
Haru!

01:04:37.766 --> 01:04:40.758
Muta, I hope I'm not too heavy.

01:04:40.836 --> 01:04:45.603
From now on,
you're not allowed to make...

01:04:45.674 --> 01:04:48.802
...any more fat jokes.

01:04:59.955 --> 01:05:02.014
I'm sorry, Muta.

01:05:05.394 --> 01:05:07.419
Hold on!

01:05:12.034 --> 01:05:14.264
I don't wanna die.

01:05:14.336 --> 01:05:16.998
You're not dead yet. Open your eyes.

01:05:17.072 --> 01:05:20.405
- Baron?
- Spread your arms and look down.

01:05:20.476 --> 01:05:23.138
I can't. I'm scared.

01:05:23.212 --> 01:05:25.442
Just trust me.

01:05:36.625 --> 01:05:41.119
- Are you sure we're still alive?
- Yes. For now.

01:05:52.808 --> 01:05:55.299
I think I could learn to like this.

01:06:07.122 --> 01:06:09.784
What are all these chickens doing here?

01:06:12.161 --> 01:06:14.789
- A flock of crows?
- Perfect timing.

01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:25.736
So, Muta, how does it feel to be saved
by a bunch of birdbrains?

01:06:25.841 --> 01:06:26.865
Toto!

01:06:26.975 --> 01:06:30.502
- It sure took you long enough.
- Nice work, Toto.

01:06:30.579 --> 01:06:34.037
I'm just glad I had enough friends
hanging out in the area.

01:06:34.116 --> 01:06:36.812
Are you sure we're not too heavy?

01:06:36.885 --> 01:06:39.581
- You're light as a feather, Haru.
- Thanks.

01:06:39.688 --> 01:06:41.451
I beg to differ.

01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:43.251
Haru, look.

01:06:44.159 --> 01:06:46.286
That's my school.

01:06:46.395 --> 01:06:49.626
I don't believe it.
I'm gonna make it home.

01:06:49.765 --> 01:06:51.699
Thank you, everyone.

01:07:00.242 --> 01:07:02.403
Unbelievable.

01:07:02.511 --> 01:07:04.308
We won't forget you, Miss Haru.

01:07:05.581 --> 01:07:07.674
Your Majesty?

01:07:13.055 --> 01:07:16.786
I've been thinking.
It may be time for me to retire.

01:07:17.693 --> 01:07:20.628
I think I shall accompany you, sire.

01:07:30.138 --> 01:07:31.799
Thanks, Toto.

01:07:33.408 --> 01:07:36.775
Oh boy, my heart is still pounding.

01:07:36.845 --> 01:07:40.246
- Scared, were you?
- Yes. But I had fun, too.

01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:41.839
Really? I didn't.

01:07:41.917 --> 01:07:45.683
Well then,
now that Haru's problem is solved,

01:07:45.787 --> 01:07:49.245
we should let her go home
and get some rest.

01:07:49.358 --> 01:07:50.848
Catnap.

01:07:50.926 --> 01:07:53.520
I guess this is goodbye?

01:07:53.595 --> 01:07:55.688
One last chore to do.

01:08:08.744 --> 01:08:13.613
Baron, just for the record, I think
I may have a little crush on you.

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:17.912
Just for the record, I admire a young
woman who speaks from the heart.

01:08:21.089 --> 01:08:25.617
If you ever need us, you will always
know how to find us again.

01:08:25.694 --> 01:08:30.096
And the Bureau's doors will be open
to you, be it day or night.

01:08:30.165 --> 01:08:32.962
Until then, trust yourself.

01:08:39.274 --> 01:08:40.741
Goodbye.

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:50.142
I'll miss you!

01:08:51.053 --> 01:08:52.111
Toto.

01:08:52.187 --> 01:08:53.279
Baron.

01:08:53.354 --> 01:08:55.448
And Fatso!

01:08:55.524 --> 01:08:58.960
- Fatso? I heard that.
- She's only telling the truth.

01:08:59.027 --> 01:09:00.426
Shut up, birdbrain.

01:09:00.495 --> 01:09:03.725
Don't give me that again
or I might drop you.

01:09:03.832 --> 01:09:05.459
Shut up, you birdbrain.

01:09:36.331 --> 01:09:38.356
Oh! I've got to get up.

01:09:46.241 --> 01:09:47.731
Morning.

01:09:47.843 --> 01:09:50.710
Haru? What are you doing up so early?

01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:52.609
It's not even a school day.

01:09:52.714 --> 01:09:55.842
I'm going out with Hiromi.
Don't want to waste the day.

01:09:56.017 --> 01:09:57.143
Huh?

01:09:57.219 --> 01:09:59.278
So...

01:09:59.755 --> 01:10:01.814
I made some breakfast for both of us.

01:10:02.023 --> 01:10:04.389
- What?
- I'm done so help yourself.

01:10:04.493 --> 01:10:06.791
And I made some tea, too.

01:10:06.862 --> 01:10:08.921
Oh, by the way...

01:10:09.865 --> 01:10:12.197
...that's my own special blend of tea.

01:10:12.267 --> 01:10:16.033
It's a bit different every time
so I can't guarantee the flavor.

01:10:18.106 --> 01:10:20.199
Oh, okay.

01:10:24.079 --> 01:10:26.479
What do you know? Smells good.

01:10:26.548 --> 01:10:28.607
That's a great outfit.

01:10:29.084 --> 01:10:31.917
I got some big news
you'll be excited about.

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:34.215
Yeah? What is it?

01:10:34.289 --> 01:10:37.781
Machida broke up with his girlfriend.

01:10:41.863 --> 01:10:45.492
- Oh, that's too bad.
- What? Are you kidding?

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:48.797
- What do you mean?
- I thought you'd be ecstatic.

01:10:48.904 --> 01:10:52.101
Not really. Doesn't matter any more.

01:11:04.085 --> 01:11:06.383
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:11:06.455 --> 01:11:09.185
- Liar.
- I'm better than ever.

01:11:10.358 --> 01:11:13.794
What's going on with you and Tsuge?

01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:15.294
Nothing new.

01:11:15.397 --> 01:11:17.957
- Come on.
- Nothing's happening.
