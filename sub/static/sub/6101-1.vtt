- # Straw #

02:02.887 --> 02:06.187

02:06.222 --> 02:09.314

- Aah!

02:09.348 --> 02:12.407

Your people cry #

02:21.962 --> 02:25.304
# Help us now #

02:25.339 --> 02:28.013
# This dark hour #

02:28.048 --> 02:30.612
# Deliver us #

02:30.647 --> 02:33.887
# Hear our call
Deliver us #

02:33.922 --> 02:37.544
# Lord of all
remember us #

02:37.579 --> 02:41.167
# Here in this burning sand #

02:41.202 --> 02:43.252
# Deliver us #

02:43.287 --> 02:48.527
# There's a land
You promised us #

02:48.562 --> 02:53.767
# Deliver us
to the Promised Land #

# My son
I have nothing I can give #

03:18.782 --> 03:23.047
# But this chance
that you may live #

03:23.082 --> 03:26.372
# I pray
we'll meet again #

03:26.407 --> 03:30.007
- # If He will deliver us #
- # Deliver us #

03:30.042 --> 03:32.292
- # Hear our prayer #
- Ohh!

03:32.327 --> 03:37.687
- # Deliver us from despair
These years of slavery #

03:37.722 --> 03:39.807
# Grow too cruel to stand #

03:40.807 --> 03:42.447
# Deliver us #

03:42.487 --> 03:46.167
# There's a land
You promised us #

03:46.202 --> 03:48.344
# Deliver us #

03:48.379 --> 03:50.487
# Out of bondage #

03:50.522 --> 03:53.012
# And #

03:53.047 --> 03:54.452
# Deliver us #

03:54.487 --> 04:01.927
# To the Promised Land #

04:11.687 --> 04:15.052
# Hush now, my baby #

04:15.087 --> 04:17.807
# Be still, love
Don't cry #

04:17.841 --> 04:20.527
# Sleep
as you're rocked #

04:20.562 --> 04:25.612
# By the stream #

04:25.647 --> 04:28.927
# Sleep and remember #

04:28.962 --> 04:32.092
# My last lullaby #

04:32.127 --> 04:35.047
# So I'll be
with you #

04:35.082 --> 04:39.447
# When you dream #

04:45.607 --> 04:48.987
# River, oh, river #

04:49.022 --> 04:52.134
# Flow gently for me #

04:52.169 --> 04:55.247
# Such precious cargo #

04:55.282 --> 04:58.452
# You bear #

04:58.487 --> 05:01.927
# Do you know somewhere #

05:01.962 --> 05:05.287
# He can live free #

05:05.322 --> 05:07.092
# River #

05:07.127 --> 05:12.807
# Deliver him there #

06:34.967 --> 06:36.852
# Brother #

06:36.887 --> 06:41.807
# You're safe now
and safe may you stay #

06:41.842 --> 06:47.607
# For I have a prayer
&ust for you #

06:48.727 --> 06:51.812
# Grow, baby brother #

06:51.847 --> 06:56.467
- # Come back someday #
- Mmm.

06:56.502 --> 07:01.087
# Come and deliver us too #

07:07.767 --> 07:09.687
Mommy!

07:11.167 --> 07:15.287
Come, Rameses. We will show Pharaoh
your new baby brother-

07:15.322 --> 07:18.292
Moses.

07:18.327 --> 07:20.372
# Deliver us #

07:20.407 --> 07:24.927
# Send a shepherd
to shepherd us #

07:24.962 --> 07:27.172
# And deliver us #

07:27.207 --> 07:33.687
# To the Promised Land #

07:33.722 --> 07:35.892
# Deliver us #

07:35.927 --> 07:40.047
# To the Promised #

07:40.082 --> 07:46.532
# Land #

07:46.567 --> 07:51.607
# Deliver us ##

07:57.007 --> 07:59.687
- Ha, ha!
- Faster, you beasts!

07:59.722 --> 08:01.567
You run like mules.

08:05.567 --> 08:10.687
- Hey, Rameses, how'd you like your
face carved on a wall? - Someday, yes.

08:10.722 --> 08:13.447
How about now?

08:14.647 --> 08:18.132
You almost killed me!

08:18.167 --> 08:20.527
Oh, come on.
Where's your sense of fun?

08:20.562 --> 08:24.367
Oh, it's fun you want?

08:24.402 --> 08:27.367
Whoa!

08:30.047 --> 08:32.967
Whoa! Aah!

08:36.407 --> 08:38.327
Ohh. Moses?

08:38.361 --> 08:41.486
Whoa!

08:44.647 --> 08:48.247
Whoa!

08:51.127 --> 08:53.047
Whoa!

08:56.207 --> 08:59.052
Come on, you.
Whoa!

08:59.087 --> 09:02.087
Come on, Moses. Admit it.
You've always looked up to me.

09:02.122 --> 09:04.727
Yes, but it's
not much of a view.

09:04.762 --> 09:08.404
Hyah! Whoo!

09:08.439 --> 09:11.972
Hey!

09:12.007 --> 09:15.447
- Second born, second place.
- Not for long.

09:26.007 --> 09:27.527
Whoa!

09:31.887 --> 09:35.727
- Whoa!
- Aah! Aaah!

09:52.247 --> 09:55.167
&ump!

10:12.567 --> 10:16.487
Whoa!

10:31.567 --> 10:34.527
Whoo!

10:36.247 --> 10:39.207
You don't think we'll
get in trouble for this, do you?

10:39.242 --> 10:41.087
No, not a chance.

10:41.207 --> 10:44.247
Why do the gods
torment me...

10:44.282 --> 10:47.172
with such reckless,
destructive,

10:47.207 --> 10:49.767
- blasphemous sons?
- Father, hear what I-

10:49.802 --> 10:52.367
Be still!
Pharaoh speaks.

10:53.647 --> 10:56.212
I seek to build
an empire,

10:56.247 --> 10:59.047
and your only thought
is to amuse yourselves...

10:59.082 --> 11:00.892
by tearing it down.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.812
Have I taught you nothing?

11:02.847 --> 11:06.847
You mustn't be so hard on yourself, Your
Ma&esty. You're an excellent teacher.

11:06.882 --> 11:09.847
It's not your fault
your sons learned nothing.

11:09.882 --> 11:11.767
- They learned blasphemy.
- True.

11:11.802 --> 11:14.812
Father,
the fault is mine.

11:14.847 --> 11:17.847
I goaded Rameses on,
and so I am responsible.

11:17.882 --> 11:20.332
Hmm.
Responsible.

11:20.367 --> 11:23.367
Do you know the meaning
of that word, Rameses?

11:23.402 --> 11:25.212
I understand, Father.

11:25.247 --> 11:29.287
And do you understand the task for which
your birth has destined you?

11:29.322 --> 11:31.612
The ancient traditions.

11:31.647 --> 11:33.852
When I pass
into the next world,

11:33.887 --> 11:36.892
then you will be
the morning and evening star.

11:36.927 --> 11:39.607
One damaged temple does not
destroy centuries of tradition.

11:39.642 --> 11:42.727
But one weak link
can break the chain...

11:42.762 --> 11:46.607
of a mighty dynasty!

11:54.287 --> 11:56.767
You have my leave to go.

11:56.802 --> 11:58.687
Father.

12:11.447 --> 12:13.332
Father?

12:13.367 --> 12:16.567
You know it was
really my fault.

12:16.602 --> 12:19.692
Must you be
so hard on him?

12:19.727 --> 12:23.487
Moses, you will never
have to carry a burden...

12:23.522 --> 12:26.492
like the crown
I will pass to Rameses.

12:26.527 --> 12:31.447
He must not allow himself
to be led astray,

12:31.482 --> 12:34.247
not even by you, my son.

12:35.767 --> 12:39.107
All he cares about is-
is your approval.

12:39.142 --> 12:42.447
I know he will live up
to your expectations.

12:42.482 --> 12:44.927
He only needs
the opportunity.

12:44.962 --> 12:47.727
Maybe. Maybe so.

12:49.247 --> 12:52.447
Go now. I shall
see you both tonight.

13:06.087 --> 13:08.927
- Well, that went well.
- &ust go away.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.772
Could have been worse.

13:10.807 --> 13:14.367
"The weak link in the chain. "
That's what he called me.

13:16.327 --> 13:19.252
Well, you are
rather pathetic.

13:19.287 --> 13:22.212
Irresponsible,
ignorant of the traditions.

13:22.247 --> 13:25.167
He practically accused me
of bringing down the dynasty.

13:25.202 --> 13:27.807
Yeah, I can see it now.
There go the pyramids!

13:27.842 --> 13:31.052
You can laugh about it.

13:31.087 --> 13:34.652
Statues cracking and toppling over.
The Nile drying up.

13:34.687 --> 13:39.527
Single-handedly, you will manage to bring
the greatest kingdom on Earth to ruin.

13:39.562 --> 13:41.292
Tell me this, Moses.

13:41.327 --> 13:43.687
Why is it that every time
you start something,

13:43.722 --> 13:46.407
I'm the one
who ends up in trouble?

13:46.442 --> 13:49.172
Ah, man! Oh.

13:49.207 --> 13:53.107
- Ah, it's Rameses. You're in trouble.
- Get down here!

13:53.142 --> 13:57.007
- I think you owe us an apology.
- Oh, my new thing!

13:57.042 --> 13:59.732
- I am so upset!
- You might as well.

13:59.767 --> 14:02.287
- You'll pay for this.
- We're gonna tell the Pharaoh!

14:02.322 --> 14:05.332
Hmm.

14:05.367 --> 14:09.367
- Oh, look at me. I'm drenched again.
- Hey. I figured it out.

14:09.402 --> 14:11.892
- You know what your problem is, Rameses?
- What?

14:11.927 --> 14:15.807
- You care too much. - And your
problem is, you don't care at all.

14:15.842 --> 14:18.647
Oh, in that case, I suppose
you care a lot more than I do...

14:18.682 --> 14:22.367
that we're late for the banquet,
for example.

14:22.447 --> 14:25.532
I'm done for.

14:25.567 --> 14:28.407
- Father will kill me.
- Don't worry.

14:28.442 --> 14:31.247
Nobody will even
notice us coming in.

14:35.727 --> 14:39.087
"Nobody will
even notice. "

14:41.887 --> 14:43.972
Ah, the young princes.

14:44.007 --> 14:46.932
Rameses, you were &ust
named prince regent.

14:46.967 --> 14:51.207
You are now responsible
for overseeing all the temples.

14:51.242 --> 14:53.927
I suggest
you get over there...

14:53.962 --> 14:56.564
and thank your father.

14:56.599 --> 14:58.883
Apparently, Moses,

14:58.918 --> 15:01.132
someone thought he...

15:01.167 --> 15:04.127
&ust needed
the opportunity.

15:05.247 --> 15:07.732
My lord Pharaoh.

15:07.767 --> 15:10.487
I propose that the high priests
offer tribute...

15:10.522 --> 15:12.332
to their new regent.

15:12.367 --> 15:14.967
An excellent idea.
Hotep! Huy!

15:15.002 --> 15:16.732
- Huy.
- Hmm?

15:16.767 --> 15:18.807
- The Midian girl.
- That's a good idea!

15:18.842 --> 15:20.727
Go get her.

15:21.687 --> 15:24.052
By the power of Ra,

15:24.087 --> 15:27.727
we present for your
delectation and delight...

15:27.762 --> 15:31.367
an exotic apparition
stolen from a faraway land.

15:38.767 --> 15:42.767
- We offer you this
delicate desert flower.

15:49.207 --> 15:52.007
Let us inspect
this... desert flower.

15:53.407 --> 15:55.972
More like a desert cobra.

15:56.007 --> 15:58.767
Not much of a snake
charmer, are you?

15:58.802 --> 16:01.012
That's why I
give her to you.

16:01.047 --> 16:04.647
- No, that's generous, but-
- I won't be given to anyone.

16:04.682 --> 16:07.764
Especially an arrogant,
pampered palace brat!

16:07.799 --> 16:10.772
Are you going to
let her talk to you like that?

16:10.807 --> 16:13.887
You will show the proper respect
for a prince of Egypt.

16:13.922 --> 16:16.367
But I am showing you
all the respect you deserve-

16:16.402 --> 16:17.732
none!

16:17.767 --> 16:20.972
No. Wait!

16:21.007 --> 16:23.252
- Be still.
- Untie this rope!

16:23.287 --> 16:25.207
- I demand you set me free!
- Be still.

16:25.242 --> 16:28.247
- Let go!
- As you wish.

16:28.282 --> 16:30.567
Aah! Ohh!

16:38.607 --> 16:41.972
You there!

16:42.007 --> 16:43.932
Have her dried off...

16:43.967 --> 16:47.372
and sent to
Prince Moses' chambers.

16:47.407 --> 16:51.167
If it pleases you,
Father, my first act as regent...

16:51.202 --> 16:53.087
is to appoint Moses...

16:53.122 --> 16:55.647
as royal chief...

16:55.682 --> 16:57.687
architect.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.827
Well-

17:25.862 --> 17:28.487
Right.

17:43.167 --> 17:46.047
Shh. Come on.

17:54.647 --> 17:56.492
Guards.

17:56.527 --> 17:59.047
Prince Moses.

18:01.607 --> 18:03.687
Uh...

18:04.887 --> 18:07.487
there's a-a man
tied up in my room.

18:08.727 --> 18:11.447
- Well, look into it.
- Right away, sire.

18:25.287 --> 18:27.892
Please, I need water.

18:27.927 --> 18:31.047
- I have a long &ourney ahead of me.
- May God protect you.

18:31.082 --> 18:33.447
Thank you.

18:35.087 --> 18:37.007
Hut-hut.

18:47.687 --> 18:52.287
- Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I-

18:52.322 --> 18:54.612
Oh, please forgive me. I-

18:54.647 --> 18:58.087
I didn't expect
to see... you...

18:58.122 --> 19:00.224
here, of all places,

19:00.259 --> 19:02.252
at-at-at our door.

19:02.287 --> 19:05.812
- Mmm, at last!
- At last?

19:05.847 --> 19:08.487
Didn't I tell you, Aaron? I knew he
would return to us when he was ready.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.404
Miriam, do you
want us flogged?

19:10.439 --> 19:12.252
I knew you cared
about our freedom.

19:12.287 --> 19:14.687
- Miriam!
- Freedom? Why would I care about that?

19:14.722 --> 19:18.527
Because you're-
well, you're our brother.

19:18.562 --> 19:20.367
- What?
- Be-

19:23.967 --> 19:26.927
- They never told you?
- Who never told me what?

19:29.247 --> 19:31.252
But you're here.
You must know.

19:31.287 --> 19:34.227
- Be careful, slave!
- Oh, my good prince.

19:34.262 --> 19:37.167
Um, she's-she's exhausted
from the day's work.

19:37.202 --> 19:39.064
Uh, not that it
was too much.

19:39.099 --> 19:40.892
We- We quite
enjoyed it.

19:40.927 --> 19:43.727
But-But she's confused
and knows not to whom she speaks.

19:43.762 --> 19:47.487
I know to whom I speak, Aaron.
I know who you are.

19:47.522 --> 19:49.812
- You are not a prince of Egypt.
- Miriam.

19:49.847 --> 19:52.507
- What did you say?
- Your Highness, pay her no heed.

19:52.542 --> 19:54.994
C- Come, Miriam.
May I discuss something with you?

19:55.029 --> 19:57.412
No, Aaron. No!
Please, Moses, you must believe!

19:57.447 --> 19:59.927
- That's enough.
- You were born of my mother, Yocheved.

19:59.962 --> 20:02.012
- Stop it.
- You are our brother!

20:02.047 --> 20:04.927
Now you go too far.
You shall be punished.

20:04.962 --> 20:08.132
No! Please, uh,
Your Highness.

20:08.167 --> 20:11.047
She's ill. She's very ill.
We beg your forgiveness.

20:11.082 --> 20:13.212
- Please, Miriam, let us go.
- No, Aaron.

20:13.247 --> 20:16.367
Our mother set you adrift
in a basket to save your life!

20:16.402 --> 20:18.412
Save my life?
From who?

20:18.447 --> 20:20.607
Ask the man
that you call "Father. "

20:22.007 --> 20:25.532
- How dare you?
- God saved you to be our deliverer.

20:25.567 --> 20:29.447
- Enough of this.
- And you are, Moses. You are the deliverer.

20:29.482 --> 20:31.247
I said, enough!

20:32.887 --> 20:35.287
You will regret
this night.

20:42.567 --> 20:46.732
# Hush now, my baby #

20:46.767 --> 20:50.167
# Be still, love
Don't cry #

20:51.607 --> 20:54.207
# Sleep
as you're rocked #

20:54.242 --> 20:57.527
# By the stream #

20:58.727 --> 21:02.667
# Sleep and remember #

21:02.702 --> 21:06.474
# My last lullaby #

21:06.509 --> 21:10.598
# So I'll be with you #

21:10.633 --> 21:14.687
# When you dream ##

21:30.167 --> 21:33.887
Did you see him? It's Moses.

21:52.567 --> 21:56.332
# Gleaming in the moonlight #

21:56.367 --> 22:00.207
# Cool and clean
and all I've ever known #

22:00.242 --> 22:02.527
# All I ever wanted #

22:04.367 --> 22:07.207
# Sweet perfumes
of incense #

22:08.407 --> 22:11.407
# And graceful rooms
of alabaster stone #

22:11.442 --> 22:14.704
# All I ever wanted #

22:14.739 --> 22:17.932
# This is my home #

22:17.967 --> 22:20.147
# With my father
mother, brother #

22:20.182 --> 22:22.327
# Oh, so noble
Oh, so strong #

22:22.362 --> 22:25.772
# Now I am home #

22:25.807 --> 22:28.887
# Here among my trappings
and belongings #

22:28.922 --> 22:31.212
# I belong #

22:31.247 --> 22:34.527
# And if anybody doubts it #

22:34.562 --> 22:37.652
# They couldn't
be more wrong #

22:37.687 --> 22:40.212
# I am a sovereign
prince of Egypt #

22:40.247 --> 22:43.687
# A son of the proud history
that's shown #

22:43.722 --> 22:48.092
# Etched on every wall #

22:48.127 --> 22:51.487
# Surely this is all
I ever wanted #

22:51.522 --> 22:55.207
# All I ever wanted #

22:55.242 --> 22:59.064
# All I ever #

22:59.099 --> 23:02.887
# Wanted ##

25:44.127 --> 25:47.127
The Hebrews grew
too numerous.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.947
They might have risen
against us.

25:50.982 --> 25:53.847
Father, tell me
you didn't do this.

25:53.882 --> 25:56.452
Moses,

25:56.487 --> 26:00.607
sometimes,
for the greater good,

26:00.642 --> 26:03.887
sacrifices must be made.

26:10.567 --> 26:12.527
Sacrifices?

26:15.487 --> 26:18.092
Oh, my son.

26:18.127 --> 26:21.367
They were only slaves.

26:38.647 --> 26:41.412
Moses?

26:41.447 --> 26:44.132
Is this where
you found me?

26:44.167 --> 26:47.687
Moses, please try
to understand.

26:50.687 --> 26:54.707
So- So everything
I thought,

26:54.742 --> 26:58.727
everything I am,
is a lie.

26:58.762 --> 27:00.492
No.

27:00.527 --> 27:04.087
You are our son,
and we love you.

27:05.527 --> 27:08.087
Why did you choose me?

27:08.122 --> 27:10.544
We didn't, Moses.

27:10.579 --> 27:12.967
The gods did.

27:19.167 --> 27:22.187
# This is your home
my son #

27:22.222 --> 27:25.974
# Here the river
brought you #

27:26.009 --> 27:29.727
# And it's here
the river meant #

27:29.762 --> 27:32.932
# To be your home #

27:32.967 --> 27:36.227
# Now you know
the truth, love #

27:36.262 --> 27:39.372
# Now forget
and be content #

27:39.407 --> 27:43.387
# When the gods
send you a blessing #

27:43.422 --> 27:47.367
# You don't ask why
it was sent ##

28:03.167 --> 28:06.812
Last night, the gods
granted me a vision.

28:06.847 --> 28:11.047
I'm not merely going to restore
this temple, I will make it more grand,

28:11.082 --> 28:14.407
more splendid
than any other one in Egypt.

28:33.687 --> 28:35.932
Aah.

28:35.967 --> 28:37.887
- Get up!
- Aah!

28:44.727 --> 28:47.052
Moses! Look.

28:47.087 --> 28:51.207
Fate has turned our little misadventure
into a great opportunity.

28:51.242 --> 28:53.847
- Get up, old man!
- Father will be so pleased-

28:53.882 --> 28:57.887
Put your back into it!

28:57.922 --> 29:00.612
Faster!

29:00.647 --> 29:02.612
This is &ust
the beginning.

29:02.647 --> 29:06.367
A gateway will open to an entire
new city of white limestone,

29:06.402 --> 29:08.584
more dazzling
than the sun.

29:08.619 --> 29:10.767
And here, a statue of Hapi.

29:10.802 --> 29:12.572
I said, hurry!

29:12.607 --> 29:15.292
- ... two great column halls.
- Stop it!

29:15.327 --> 29:17.367
- Somebody's got to stop this!
- There's nothing we can do.

29:29.127 --> 29:31.012
Stop it.

29:31.047 --> 29:32.932
Stop. Stop it!

29:32.967 --> 29:36.487
- Leave that man alone!
- Moses!

29:46.487 --> 29:50.767
Out of my way.
Out of my way. Move!

29:50.802 --> 29:52.612
Who did this?

29:52.647 --> 29:56.607
Up there! It's him.
Up there.

30:08.727 --> 30:10.167
Moses!

30:21.527 --> 30:24.487
Moses, what's going on?
Moses!

30:32.207 --> 30:34.767
Moses!

30:36.287 --> 30:38.732
- Moses!
- Let me go!

30:38.767 --> 30:42.367
- No, wait. - You saw what happened.
I &ust killed a man.

30:42.402 --> 30:44.892
We can take care
of that.

30:44.927 --> 30:47.092
I will make it
so it never happened.

30:47.127 --> 30:50.307
Nothing you can say
can change what I've done.

30:50.342 --> 30:53.274
I am Egypt, the morning
and the evening star.

30:53.309 --> 30:56.207
If I say day is night,
it will be written,

30:56.242 --> 30:59.047
and you will be
what I say you are.

30:59.082 --> 31:01.132
I say you are innocent.

31:01.167 --> 31:04.767
What you say does not matter.
You don't understand.

31:04.802 --> 31:06.647
I can't stay here
any longer.

31:06.682 --> 31:08.492
- Moses!
- No!

31:08.527 --> 31:12.287
All I've ever known
to be true is a lie.

31:14.607 --> 31:17.187
I'm not who
you think I am.

31:17.222 --> 31:19.692
What are you
talking about?

31:19.727 --> 31:23.367
Go ask the man
I once called "Father. "

31:26.047 --> 31:29.007
Moses?

31:29.927 --> 31:31.807
Please.

31:38.767 --> 31:41.207
Good-bye, brother.

31:45.927 --> 31:47.887
Moses!

31:49.007 --> 31:50.927
Moses!

32:52.887 --> 32:55.047
No.

32:57.607 --> 33:00.127
Aah!

33:49.807 --> 33:52.647
Aaah!

34:00.607 --> 34:04.487
Hey, wait.

34:06.047 --> 34:08.007
Please.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.927
Ohh!

34:21.286 --> 34:24.246
Oh!

34:30.447 --> 34:32.331
What are you doing?

34:32.367 --> 34:35.327
- Help!
- Let our sheep drink!

34:35.362 --> 34:38.286
Leave us alone!
Get away!

34:38.322 --> 34:42.652
Stop it!

34:42.687 --> 34:45.107
My father's
the high priest of Midian.

34:45.141 --> 34:47.527
You're going to be
in big trouble.

34:47.562 --> 34:50.452
- Aah!
- Hey, you.

34:50.487 --> 34:53.167
Aren't these
your camels?

34:54.327 --> 34:56.967
- Hut-hut!
- No, no! No, no!

34:57.002 --> 34:59.287
- Wait!
- Wait, stop!

35:05.727 --> 35:07.647
Whoa!

35:14.927 --> 35:16.812
What are you girls
doing?

35:16.847 --> 35:19.327
We're trying to get the funny man
out of the well.

35:19.362 --> 35:21.924
Trying to get the funny man
out of the well.

35:21.959 --> 35:24.983
- Well, that's one
I've never heard before.

35:25.018 --> 35:28.007
Oh, my.
Oh, uh, don't worry down there!

35:28.042 --> 35:30.127
Uh, we'll get you out.
Hold on!

35:34.007 --> 35:36.507
You.

35:36.542 --> 35:39.054
Huh?

35:39.089 --> 35:41.567
Ohh!

35:44.007 --> 35:45.927
Mm-hmm.

35:47.807 --> 35:51.847
That's why Papa says
she'll never get married.

35:55.447 --> 35:59.487
You don't have to do this. Ladies,
please, I'm really- I'm really quite-

35:59.522 --> 36:01.772
No, not there, please.

36:01.807 --> 36:04.527
That tickles. Ladies,
you've cleaned every inch of me.

36:04.562 --> 36:06.612
Whoa, I- I was wrong.

36:06.647 --> 36:10.327
Let me through. Let me through.
I want to see him.

36:10.362 --> 36:14.172
Ah! You are most welcome.

36:14.207 --> 36:16.767
You should not be
a stranger in this land.

36:16.802 --> 36:19.212
You have been sent
as a blessing.

36:19.247 --> 36:22.447
Tonight, you shall be my honored guest.

36:24.607 --> 36:28.247
My father, &ethro,
High Priest of Midian.

36:36.687 --> 36:39.407
Psst. Sit with me.

36:39.442 --> 36:42.127
Um, all right.

36:44.607 --> 36:47.332
Psst. Not yet.

36:47.367 --> 36:50.052
- Oh, sorry.
- My children,

36:50.087 --> 36:54.207
let us give thanks
for this bountiful food.

36:55.327 --> 36:57.932
And let us also give thanks
for the presence...

36:57.967 --> 37:01.767
of this brave, young man
whom we honor here tonight.

37:01.802 --> 37:05.892
Please, sir, I wish you wouldn't.

37:05.927 --> 37:09.007
I've done nothing in my life
worth honoring.

37:12.607 --> 37:15.932
First, you rescue Tzipporah
from Egypt,

37:15.967 --> 37:18.967
- then you defend my younger
daughters from brigands.

37:19.002 --> 37:22.052
You think that is nothing?

37:22.087 --> 37:25.567
It seems you do not know
what is worthy of honor.

37:25.602 --> 37:27.984
# A single thread
in a tapestry #

37:28.019 --> 37:30.367
# Though its color
brightly shine #

37:30.402 --> 37:32.452
# Can never see
its purpose #

37:32.487 --> 37:35.287
# In a pattern
of the grand design #

37:36.567 --> 37:38.967
# And the stone that sits
on the very top #

37:39.002 --> 37:41.104
# Of the mountain's
mighty face #

37:41.139 --> 37:44.273
# Does it think
it's more important #

37:44.308 --> 37:47.292
# Than the stones
that form the base #

37:47.327 --> 37:49.927
# So how can you see
what your life is worth #

37:49.962 --> 37:52.132
# Or where
your value lies #

37:52.167 --> 37:56.127
# You can never see
through the eyes of man #

37:56.162 --> 37:58.532
# You must look
at your life #

37:58.567 --> 38:01.852
# Look at your life
through heaven's eyes #

38:01.887 --> 38:04.647
# La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la #

38:04.682 --> 38:06.684
# La, la-la-la-la-la-la #

38:06.719 --> 38:08.652
# La-la-la-la-la-la #

38:08.687 --> 38:12.727
- # Lai-lai-lai, lai-lai-lai-lai
Lai-lai-lai, lai-lai-la # - Dance with me.

38:12.762 --> 38:16.167
No, I don't know how.

38:25.487 --> 38:27.447
# A lake of gold
in the desert sand #

38:27.482 --> 38:29.564
# Is less than
a cool, fresh spring #

38:29.599 --> 38:31.783
# And to one lost sheep
a shepherd boy #

38:31.818 --> 38:33.967
# Is greater
than the richest king #

38:35.287 --> 38:38.007
# If a man lose
everything he owns #

38:38.042 --> 38:40.087
# Has he truly
lost his worth #

38:40.122 --> 38:42.132
# Or is it the beginning #

38:42.167 --> 38:46.092
# Of a new and brighter birth #

38:46.127 --> 38:48.727
# So how do you measure
the worth of a man #

38:48.762 --> 38:50.852
# In wealth or strength
or size #

38:50.887 --> 38:55.007
# In how much he gained
or how much he gave #

38:55.042 --> 38:57.332
# The answer will come #

38:57.367 --> 39:01.127
# The answer will come
to him who tries #

39:01.162 --> 39:04.424
# To look at his life
through heaven's eyes #

39:04.459 --> 39:07.687
# And that's why we share
all we have with you #

39:07.722 --> 39:09.964
# Though there's little
to be found #

39:09.999 --> 39:12.343
# When all you've got
is nothing #

39:12.378 --> 39:14.687
# There's a lot
to go around #

39:16.567 --> 39:19.167
# No life can escape
being blown about #

39:19.202 --> 39:21.652
# By the winds
of change and chance #

39:21.687 --> 39:24.487
- # And though you never know
all the steps # - Dance with me.

39:24.522 --> 39:28.807
- No, I- No. No!
- # You must learn to &oin the dance #

39:28.842 --> 39:32.247
# You must learn
to &oin the dance #

39:32.282 --> 39:34.892
# La-la-la
Lee-lai-lai-lai #

39:34.927 --> 39:37.172
# Lai-lai-lai-lai
Lai-lai-lai-lai #

39:37.207 --> 39:40.947
# Lai-lai-lai-lai, lee-lai-lai
Lai-lai-lai-lai, lai-lai-lai #

39:40.982 --> 39:45.114
# Lai-lai-lai-lai, lee-lai-lai,
lai-lai-lai-lai, lai-lai-lai #

39:45.149 --> 39:48.498
# Lai-lai-lai-lai, lee-lai-lai
Lai-lai-lai-lai-lai-lai-lai #

39:48.533 --> 39:51.847
# Lai-lai-lai-lai, lee-lai-lai
Lai-lai-lai-lai, lai-lai-lai #

39:51.882 --> 39:55.847
# Lai-lai-lai-lai, lee-lai-lai
Lai-lai-lai-lai-lai #

39:55.882 --> 39:59.567
# So how do you &udge
what a man is worth #

39:59.602 --> 40:02.052
# By what he builds
or buys #

40:02.087 --> 40:04.847
# You can never see
with your eyes on earth #

40:04.882 --> 40:07.087
# Look through
heaven's eyes #

40:07.122 --> 40:11.092
# Look at your life #

40:11.127 --> 40:15.567
# Look at your life
through heaven's #

40:15.602 --> 40:23.447
# Eyes ##

40:35.087 --> 40:37.047
Mmm.

40:38.727 --> 40:40.687
I love you.

40:57.367 --> 40:59.287
Ahh!

41:19.087 --> 41:21.567
It's too early
for this.

42:18.047 --> 42:20.487
Moses.

42:22.567 --> 42:24.527
Moses.

42:25.927 --> 42:29.447
Moses.

42:32.407 --> 42:34.367
Here I am.

42:35.847 --> 42:39.772
Take the sandals
from your feet,

42:39.807 --> 42:43.887
for the place on which you stand
is holy ground.

42:51.087 --> 42:53.007
Who are you?

42:54.567 --> 42:57.567
I am that I am.

42:59.687 --> 43:01.772
I don't understand.

43:01.807 --> 43:05.407
I am the God of your ancestors,

43:05.442 --> 43:08.767
Abraham, Isaac
and &acob.

43:11.407 --> 43:15.327
You were born of my
mother, Yocheved. You are our brother.

43:17.487 --> 43:20.647
What do You want
with me?

43:22.167 --> 43:26.447
I have seen the oppression
of My people in Egypt...

43:26.482 --> 43:29.172
and have heard their cry.

43:29.207 --> 43:32.332
- Stop it!
Leave that man alone!

43:32.367 --> 43:35.927
So I have come down
to deliver them out of slavery...

43:36.887 --> 43:39.327
and bring them
to a good land,

43:40.887 --> 43:45.287
a land flowing
with milk and honey.

43:47.447 --> 43:50.647
And so, unto Pharaoh,

43:50.682 --> 43:53.527
I shall send...

43:53.562 --> 43:55.532
you.

43:55.567 --> 43:59.252
Me? Wh-Who am I
to lead these people?

43:59.287 --> 44:02.087
They'll never believe me.
They won't even listen.

44:02.122 --> 44:04.567
I shall teach you
what to say.

44:04.602 --> 44:07.612
Let my people go!

44:07.647 --> 44:09.772
But I was their enemy.

44:09.807 --> 44:14.247
I was the prince of Egypt, the son of
the man who slaughtered their children.

44:14.282 --> 44:16.784
You've- You've chosen
the wrong messenger.

44:16.819 --> 44:19.287
H- How can I even speak
to these people?

44:19.322 --> 44:21.852
Who made man's mouth?

44:21.887 --> 44:25.767
Who made the deaf, the mute,
the seeing or the blind?

44:25.802 --> 44:28.607
Did not I?
Now go!

44:40.767 --> 44:43.772
Oh, Moses,

44:43.807 --> 44:48.567
I shall be with you when you
go to the king of Egypt.

44:48.602 --> 44:51.207
But Pharaoh
will not listen.

44:54.847 --> 44:58.047
So I will stretch out
My hand...

44:58.082 --> 45:00.524
and smite Egypt...

45:00.559 --> 45:02.967
with all My wonders.

45:06.767 --> 45:11.047
Take the staff
in your hand, Moses.

45:11.082 --> 45:12.972
With it,

45:13.007 --> 45:16.927
you shall do My wonders.

45:21.087 --> 45:23.887
I shall be with you,
Moses.

45:23.922 --> 45:27.607
Moses.

45:29.087 --> 45:31.207
Moses.

46:47.607 --> 46:49.612
But, Moses,

46:49.647 --> 46:52.447
you are &ust one man.

46:55.527 --> 46:57.367
Tzipporah,

46:59.367 --> 47:02.047
please.

47:08.647 --> 47:11.087
Look at your family.

47:13.767 --> 47:16.532
They are free.

47:16.567 --> 47:18.612
They have a future.

47:18.647 --> 47:21.252
They have hopes
and dreams...

47:21.287 --> 47:24.367
and the promise
of a life with dignity.

47:26.767 --> 47:29.767
That is what I want
for my people.

47:31.007 --> 47:33.567
And that is why
I must do the task...

47:33.602 --> 47:36.727
that God has given me.

47:47.847 --> 47:50.287
I'm coming with you.

49:15.007 --> 49:16.812
Rameses.

49:16.847 --> 49:20.167
Moses?
Is it really?

49:24.887 --> 49:26.972
Moses!

49:27.007 --> 49:29.407
- Rameses!
- Where have you been? I took you for dead.

49:31.727 --> 49:34.892
Look at you!
Pharaoh.

49:34.927 --> 49:38.367
Well, look at you.
What on earth are you dressed as?

49:39.687 --> 49:43.007
Oh, Rameses,
it's so good to see you.

49:43.042 --> 49:44.852
Excuse me, Your Ma&esty.

49:44.887 --> 49:50.127
We are compelled to remind you this man
committed a serious crime against the gods.

49:50.162 --> 49:52.332
We are loathe
to bring it up, mind you.

49:52.367 --> 49:54.967
The law clearly states
the punishment for such a crime-

49:55.002 --> 49:56.967
- Death!
- We hesitate to say it.

49:57.002 --> 50:00.247
Be still.
Pharaoh speaks.

50:01.207 --> 50:04.247
I am the morning
and the evening star.

50:04.282 --> 50:06.132
Rameses.

50:06.167 --> 50:08.252
It shall be as I say.

50:08.287 --> 50:12.687
I pardon forever all crimes
of which he stands accused...

50:12.722 --> 50:15.127
and will have it known
that he is...

50:15.162 --> 50:17.264
our brother Moses,

50:17.299 --> 50:19.367
the prince of Egypt.

50:23.367 --> 50:25.287
Rameses,

50:26.287 --> 50:29.187
in my heart,
you are my brother,

50:29.222 --> 50:32.087
but things cannot be
as they were.

50:32.122 --> 50:34.327
I see no reason why not.

50:35.727 --> 50:40.527
You know I am a Hebrew, and the God
of the Hebrews came to me.

50:40.562 --> 50:42.852
What?

50:42.887 --> 50:45.527
He commands that you
let His people go.

50:49.167 --> 50:51.807
Commands?

50:56.407 --> 51:00.127
Behold... the power of God.

51:13.807 --> 51:17.407
Well, uh, impressive.

51:17.442 --> 51:19.772
Hmm.

51:19.807 --> 51:24.047
Very well, Moses.
I'll play along.

51:24.082 --> 51:26.372
Hotep. Huy.

51:26.407 --> 51:29.607
Give this snake charmer
our answer.

51:50.007 --> 51:52.847
By the power of Ra.

51:52.882 --> 51:54.884
Mut.

51:54.919 --> 51:56.852
Nut.

51:56.887 --> 51:58.812
- Khnum.
- Ptah.

51:58.847 --> 52:00.867
- Nephthys.
- Nekhbet.

52:00.902 --> 52:03.394
- Sobek.
- Sekhmet.

52:03.429 --> 52:05.718
Sokar. Selket. Reshpu.

52:05.753 --> 52:07.860
- Wad&et.
- Anubis.

52:07.895 --> 52:09.891
- Anukis.
- Seshmu.

52:09.926 --> 52:11.886
- Meshkent.
- Hemsut.

52:11.921 --> 52:13.772
- Tefnut.
- Heket.

52:13.807 --> 52:16.127
- Mafdet.
- Ra, Mut, Nut, Ptah.

52:16.162 --> 52:18.184
Hemsut, Tefnut,
Sokar, Selket.

52:18.219 --> 52:20.172
Seshmu, Reshpu,
Sobek, Wad&et.

52:20.207 --> 52:23.167
Heket, Mafdet,
Nephthys, Nekhbet, Ra!

52:25.847 --> 52:28.567
# So you think
you've got friends #

52:28.602 --> 52:31.132
# In high places #

52:31.167 --> 52:35.727
# With the power
to put us on the run #

52:35.762 --> 52:38.967
# Well, forgive us
these smiles #

52:39.002 --> 52:41.492
# On our faces #

52:41.527 --> 52:45.767
# You'll know what power is
when we are done #

52:45.802 --> 52:47.607
Son.

52:49.647 --> 52:53.932
# You're playing
with the big boys now #

52:53.967 --> 52:58.732
- # Playing with the big boys now #
- Oh, that's pretty.

52:58.767 --> 53:03.047
- # Every spell and gesture #
- # Tells you who's the best #

53:03.082 --> 53:09.464
# You're playing with
the big boys now #

53:09.499 --> 53:15.847
# You're playing with
the big boys now. #

53:15.882 --> 53:17.967
# Stop this
foolish mission #

53:18.002 --> 53:20.724
# Watch a true magician #

53:20.759 --> 53:23.332
# Give an exhibition how #

53:23.367 --> 53:25.572
# Pick up your
silly twig, boy #

53:25.607 --> 53:28.687
# You're playing with
the big boys now #

53:28.722 --> 53:31.767
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
- # By the power of Ra #

53:31.802 --> 53:33.784
# Mut, Nut #

53:33.819 --> 53:35.732
# Khnum, Ptah #

53:35.767 --> 53:39.772
# Sobek, Sekhmet
Sokar, Selket #

53:39.807 --> 53:43.367
# Anubis, Anukis, Hemsut
Tefnut, Meshkent, Mafdet #

53:43.402 --> 53:51.132
# You're playing with
the big boys now #

53:51.167 --> 53:55.167
# By the might of Horus
you will kneel before us #

53:55.202 --> 53:58.532
# Kneel to our
splendorous power #

53:58.567 --> 54:00.087
- # You put up a front #
- # You put up a fight #

54:00.122 --> 54:02.207
# And &ust to show
we feel no spite #

54:02.242 --> 54:04.092
# You can be our acolyte #

54:04.127 --> 54:07.607
- # But first, boy it's time to bow #
- # Kowtow #

54:07.642 --> 54:09.007
# Or it's your own grave
you'll dig, boy #

54:09.042 --> 54:11.892
# You're playing with
the big boys #

54:11.927 --> 54:18.407
# Playing with the big boys
Playing with the big boys #

54:18.442 --> 54:21.607
# Playing with
the big boys now ##

54:21.642 --> 54:23.727
They love it.

54:40.167 --> 54:42.927
All right, Moses.
I know you.

54:42.962 --> 54:45.687
What's this really about?

54:46.647 --> 54:49.447
Rameses, look.

54:49.482 --> 54:52.247
What do you see?

54:55.967 --> 54:59.527
A greater Egypt
than that of my father.

54:59.562 --> 55:02.092
That is not
what I see.

55:02.127 --> 55:06.532
Moses, I cannot
change what you see.

55:06.567 --> 55:10.007
I have to maintain
the ancient traditions.

55:10.042 --> 55:13.184
I bear the weight
of my father's crown.

55:13.219 --> 55:16.327
Do you still not understand
what Seti was?

55:16.362 --> 55:19.452
He was
a great leader.

55:19.487 --> 55:23.007
His hands bore the blood
of thousands of children.

55:23.042 --> 55:24.764
Hmph.
Slaves.

55:24.799 --> 55:26.452
My people.

55:26.487 --> 55:30.687
And I can no longer hide
in the desert while they suffer...

55:30.722 --> 55:32.807
at your hands.

55:35.607 --> 55:38.092
So...

55:38.127 --> 55:40.747
you have returned...

55:40.782 --> 55:43.367
only to free them.

55:53.487 --> 55:55.767
I'm sorry.

56:03.767 --> 56:05.727
Yes.

56:07.207 --> 56:10.127
I had hoped...

56:10.162 --> 56:11.967
that-

56:23.887 --> 56:25.847
I do not know this God.

56:26.887 --> 56:28.927
Neither will I
let your people go.

56:28.962 --> 56:31.504
Rameses, please,
you must listen-

56:31.539 --> 56:34.047
I will not be
the weak link!

56:41.407 --> 56:44.227
Tell your people
as of today...

56:44.262 --> 56:47.047
their workload
has been doubled,

56:47.082 --> 56:48.927
thanks to your God.

56:50.207 --> 56:53.127
Or is it thanks...

56:53.162 --> 56:55.007
to you?

56:59.727 --> 57:02.327
It's Moses.

57:04.407 --> 57:06.667
Moses! Ohh.

57:06.702 --> 57:08.892
So, Moses,

57:08.927 --> 57:12.367
how does it feel when you
get struck to the ground?

57:13.647 --> 57:16.567
I didn't mean
to cause you more pain.

57:16.602 --> 57:19.372
I'm &ust trying to do
as God told me.

57:19.407 --> 57:23.012
God? When did God start
caring about any of us?

57:23.047 --> 57:26.307
In fact, Moses, when did you start
caring about slaves?

57:26.342 --> 57:29.567
Was it when you found out
that you were one of us?

57:29.602 --> 57:32.144
Don't listen to him.

57:32.179 --> 57:34.572
No, he's-
he's right.

57:34.607 --> 57:38.492
I did not see because
I did not wish to see.

57:38.527 --> 57:41.372
Oh, you didn't see because
you didn't wish to see.

57:41.407 --> 57:44.447
Ah! Well, that makes everything
fine then, doesn't it?

57:44.482 --> 57:46.292
Aaron!

57:46.327 --> 57:48.767
You shame yourself.

57:50.527 --> 57:53.567
Miriam.

57:55.447 --> 57:58.047
I'm so sorry.

58:06.287 --> 58:08.532
Moses,

58:08.567 --> 58:10.892
hear what I say.

58:10.927 --> 58:13.247
I have been a slave...

58:13.282 --> 58:15.212
all my life,

58:15.247 --> 58:19.527
and God has never
answered my prayers until now.

58:19.562 --> 58:21.292
God saved you
from the river,

58:21.327 --> 58:24.172
He saved you
in all your wanderings,

58:24.207 --> 58:27.367
and even now He saves you
from the wrath of Pharaoh.

58:27.402 --> 58:30.247
God will not abandon you,

58:31.527 --> 58:33.967
so don't you abandon us.

59:05.287 --> 59:07.727
Miriam.
Where are you going?

59:07.762 --> 59:09.647
M- Miriam.

59:22.647 --> 59:25.487
The ball disappears.
Where is it? In his hand.

59:28.767 --> 59:30.647
Rameses!

59:31.807 --> 59:34.567
Let my people go!

59:36.447 --> 59:39.407
Still gnawing away
at that bone, are we?

59:39.442 --> 59:40.892
Carry on.

59:40.927 --> 59:43.052
You cannot
keep ignoring us.

59:43.087 --> 59:47.247
Enough! I will hear no more
of this Hebrew nonsense.

59:47.282 --> 59:49.087
Bring him to me.

59:50.847 --> 59:52.927
- Moses!
- No!

01:00:05.567 --> 01:00:09.527
Take the staff
in your hand, Moses.

01:00:36.727 --> 01:00:38.612
Father.

01:00:38.647 --> 01:00:40.747
- It's-
- Blood!

01:00:40.782 --> 01:00:42.847
Blood! Oh, blood!

01:00:53.207 --> 01:00:56.852
Hotep! Huy!
Explain this to me!

01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:59.332
- Ah!
- Rest assured, Your Ma&esty-

01:00:59.367 --> 01:01:02.287
Uh, yes, we were going to
demonstrate the superior might...

01:01:02.322 --> 01:01:04.127
of our gods.

01:01:04.162 --> 01:01:05.647
Uh-

01:01:07.287 --> 01:01:10.167
By the power of Ra!

01:01:25.207 --> 01:01:28.127
Abandon this futile mission,
Moses.

01:01:28.162 --> 01:01:31.464
I've indulged you
long enough.

01:01:31.499 --> 01:01:34.767
This must now
be finished.

01:01:36.767 --> 01:01:38.932
No, Rameses.

01:01:38.967 --> 01:01:41.212
It is only beginning.

01:01:41.247 --> 01:01:44.367
But, Moses, d-didn't you
see what happened?

01:01:44.402 --> 01:01:47.012
The priests
did the same thing.

01:01:47.047 --> 01:01:49.967
Pharaoh still has the power
over our lives.

01:01:52.447 --> 01:01:55.887
Yes, Aaron, it's true.
Pharaoh has the power.

01:01:57.167 --> 01:02:02.647
He can take away your food,
your home, your freedom.

01:02:02.682 --> 01:02:07.087
He can take away
your sons and daughters.

01:02:07.122 --> 01:02:09.212
With one word,

01:02:09.247 --> 01:02:12.207
Pharaoh can take away
your very lives.

01:02:14.047 --> 01:02:17.927
But there is one thing
he cannot take away from you:

01:02:17.962 --> 01:02:19.767
your faith.

01:02:22.007 --> 01:02:23.892
Believe,

01:02:23.927 --> 01:02:26.687
for we will see
God's wonders.

01:02:36.847 --> 01:02:38.132
# Thus saith the Lord #

01:02:38.167 --> 01:02:40.412
# Since you refuse
to free my people #

01:02:40.447 --> 01:02:43.567
- # Since you refuse to free my people #
- # Since you refuse #

01:02:43.602 --> 01:02:45.944
# All through
the land of Egypt #

01:02:45.979 --> 01:02:47.773
# I send a pestilence, a plague #

01:02:47.808 --> 01:02:49.532
# Into your house, into your bed #

01:02:49.567 --> 01:02:51.607
- # Into your streams Into your streets #
- Hmm.

01:02:51.642 --> 01:02:53.684
# Into your drink
Into your bread #

01:02:53.719 --> 01:02:55.703
# Upon your cattle, on your sheep #

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:57.652
# Upon your oxen
in your field #

01:02:57.687 --> 01:03:00.087
# Into your dreams, into your sleep #

01:03:00.122 --> 01:03:02.487
# Until you break
Until you yield #

01:03:02.522 --> 01:03:04.492
# I send the swarm #

01:03:04.527 --> 01:03:10.207
# I send the horde
Thus saith the Lord #

01:03:11.127 --> 01:03:13.092
# Once I called you brother #

01:03:13.127 --> 01:03:16.287
# Once I thought the chance
to make you laugh #

01:03:16.322 --> 01:03:17.847
# Was all I ever wanted #

01:03:17.887 --> 01:03:19.807
# I send the thunder
from the sky #

01:03:19.842 --> 01:03:21.692
# I send the fire
raining down #

01:03:21.727 --> 01:03:25.247
# And even now I wish
that God had chose another #

01:03:25.282 --> 01:03:28.007
# Serving as your foe
on His behalf #

01:03:28.042 --> 01:03:29.572
# Is the last thing #

01:03:29.607 --> 01:03:31.527
- # That I wanted #
- # I send a hail of burning ice #

01:03:31.562 --> 01:03:34.207
# On every field
On every town #

01:03:34.242 --> 01:03:36.452
# This was my home #

01:03:36.487 --> 01:03:41.527
# All this pain and devastation
how it tortures me inside #

01:03:41.562 --> 01:03:43.647
# All the innocent
who suffer #

01:03:43.682 --> 01:03:45.252
# From your stubbornness #

01:03:45.287 --> 01:03:47.447
- # And pride #
- # I send the locusts on the wind #

01:03:47.482 --> 01:03:49.404
# Such as the world
has never seen #

01:03:49.439 --> 01:03:51.292
# On every leaf
On every stalk #

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:54.407
# Until there's nothing left
of green #

01:03:54.442 --> 01:03:57.487
# I send my scourge
I send my sword #

01:03:57.522 --> 01:03:58.887
# Thus saith the Lord #

01:03:58.927 --> 01:04:00.572
# You who I called brother #

01:04:00.607 --> 01:04:04.147
# Why must you call down another blow #

01:04:04.182 --> 01:04:07.532
# I send my scourge
I send my sword #

01:04:07.567 --> 01:04:10.887
- # Let my people go #
- # Thus saith the Lord #

01:04:10.922 --> 01:04:17.447
# Thus saith the Lord #

01:04:20.687 --> 01:04:22.572
# You who I called brother #

01:04:22.607 --> 01:04:25.607
# How could you have come
to hate me so #

01:04:25.642 --> 01:04:27.047
# Is this what you wanted #

01:04:27.087 --> 01:04:29.667
# I sent the swarm
I sent the horde #

01:04:29.702 --> 01:04:32.212
# Then let my heart
be hardened #

01:04:32.247 --> 01:04:35.047
# And never mind
how high the cost may grow #

01:04:35.082 --> 01:04:37.287
# This will still be so #

01:04:37.322 --> 01:04:40.164
# I will never let #

01:04:40.199 --> 01:04:42.892
# Your people go #

01:04:42.927 --> 01:04:47.052
# Thus saith the Lord #

01:04:47.087 --> 01:04:50.847
- # I will not let #
- & Let #

01:04:50.882 --> 01:04:54.607
- # Your people #
- # My people #

01:04:54.642 --> 01:04:59.047
- # Go ##
- # Go ##

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:46.167
Rameses?

01:05:48.087 --> 01:05:50.132
Rameses?

01:05:50.167 --> 01:05:52.127
Oh. Let me guess.

01:05:53.647 --> 01:05:56.267
You want me to...

01:05:56.302 --> 01:05:58.887
let your people go.

01:06:01.567 --> 01:06:03.967
I hoped
I would find you here.

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:06.367
Get out!

01:06:07.887 --> 01:06:12.487
Rameses, we must
bring this to an end.

01:06:17.247 --> 01:06:20.387
Rameses, please,
talk to me.

01:06:20.422 --> 01:06:23.527
We could always
talk here.

01:06:32.407 --> 01:06:34.327
This place.

01:06:35.767 --> 01:06:37.727
So many memories.

01:06:40.927 --> 01:06:43.492
I remember the time you...

01:06:43.527 --> 01:06:46.967
switched the heads of the gods
of the temple of Ra.

01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:52.492
If I recall correctly,

01:06:52.527 --> 01:06:56.887
you were there switching heads
right along with me.

01:06:57.727 --> 01:07:00.287
No, it was you.
I didn't do that.

01:07:00.322 --> 01:07:02.132
Oh, yes, you did.

01:07:02.167 --> 01:07:04.767
You put the hippo on the crocodile,
and the crocodile-

01:07:04.802 --> 01:07:06.612
- On the falcon.
- Yes!

01:07:06.647 --> 01:07:10.087
The priest thought it was a horrible
omen and fasted for two months.

01:07:10.122 --> 01:07:13.287
Father was furious. You were
always getting me into trouble.

01:07:20.087 --> 01:07:22.047
But then-

01:07:23.967 --> 01:07:27.087
you were always there
to...

01:07:27.122 --> 01:07:30.207
get me out of trouble
again.

01:07:30.242 --> 01:07:32.047
Hmmph.

01:07:36.327 --> 01:07:39.727
Why can't things be
the way they were before?

01:07:41.127 --> 01:07:42.772
Father.

01:07:42.807 --> 01:07:44.727
It's so dark.

01:07:46.007 --> 01:07:48.327
I'm frightened.

01:07:49.247 --> 01:07:51.087
Why is he here?

01:07:54.647 --> 01:07:57.567
Isn't that the man
who did all this?

01:07:59.287 --> 01:08:01.652
Yes.

01:08:01.687 --> 01:08:04.607
But one must wonder...

01:08:04.642 --> 01:08:06.372
why.

01:08:06.407 --> 01:08:11.332
Because no kingdom should be made
on the backs of slaves.

01:08:11.367 --> 01:08:15.607
Rameses, your stubbornness
is bringing this misery upon Egypt.

01:08:15.642 --> 01:08:18.684
It would cease if only you
would let the Hebrews go.

01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:22.082
I will not be dictated to.
I will not be threatened.

01:08:22.118 --> 01:08:25.292
I am the morning
and the evening star. I am Pharaoh.

01:08:25.327 --> 01:08:29.447
Something else is coming. Something
much worse than anything before.

01:08:29.482 --> 01:08:32.444
Please, let go of
your contempt for life...

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:35.407
before it destroys
everything you hold dear.

01:08:35.442 --> 01:08:37.407
Think of your son!

01:08:37.442 --> 01:08:39.252
I do.

01:08:39.287 --> 01:08:42.292
You Hebrews have been
nothing but trouble.

01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:45.886
My father had the right idea
about how to deal with your people.

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:49.652
- Rameses- - And I think
it's time I finished the &ob.

01:08:49.687 --> 01:08:54.006
- Rameses! - And there shall be
a great cry in all of Egypt...

01:08:54.042 --> 01:08:56.966
such as never has been
or ever will be again!

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:14.487
Rameses, you bring this
upon yourself.

01:09:23.807 --> 01:09:26.846
God has come
to me again, saying,

01:09:26.881 --> 01:09:28.652
"Take a lamb...

01:09:28.687 --> 01:09:31.292
and with its blood...

01:09:31.327 --> 01:09:35.046
mark the lintel and posts
of every door,

01:09:37.247 --> 01:09:40.051
for tonight...

01:09:40.087 --> 01:09:44.487
I shall pass through
the land of Egypt...

01:09:44.522 --> 01:09:47.487
and smite
all the firstborn.

01:09:53.207 --> 01:09:56.647
But when I see the blood
upon your door...

01:09:58.087 --> 01:10:00.527
I will pass over you,

01:10:02.327 --> 01:10:05.767
and the plague
shall not enter. "

01:12:35.887 --> 01:12:39.367
You
and your people...

01:12:39.402 --> 01:12:42.847
have my permission to go.

01:12:47.407 --> 01:12:49.367
Leave me!

01:14:19.407 --> 01:14:22.967
# Many nights we've prayed #

01:14:23.002 --> 01:14:25.564
# With no proof #

01:14:25.599 --> 01:14:28.052
# Anyone could hear #

01:14:28.087 --> 01:14:31.847
# In our hearts
a hopeful song #

01:14:31.882 --> 01:14:36.184
# We barely understood #

01:14:36.219 --> 01:14:40.372
# Now we are not afraid #

01:14:40.407 --> 01:14:45.287
# Although we know
there's much to fear #

01:14:45.322 --> 01:14:48.412
# We were moving mountains #

01:14:48.447 --> 01:14:54.447
# Long before
we knew we could #

01:14:54.482 --> 01:14:58.167
# There can be miracles #

01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:01.644
# When you believe #

01:15:01.679 --> 01:15:04.803
# Though hope is frail #

01:15:04.838 --> 01:15:07.927
# It's hard to kill #

01:15:09.607 --> 01:15:13.607
# Who knows what miracles #

01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:16.944
# You can achieve #

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:21.113
# When you believe #

01:15:21.148 --> 01:15:24.797
# Somehow you will #

01:15:24.832 --> 01:15:28.447
# You will when you #

01:15:28.482 --> 01:15:31.487
# Believe #

01:15:32.607 --> 01:15:36.252
# In this time of fear #

01:15:36.287 --> 01:15:40.087
# When prayers so often
proved in vain #

01:15:40.122 --> 01:15:43.887
# Hope seemed like
the summer birds #

01:15:43.922 --> 01:15:47.572
# Too swiftly flown away #

01:15:47.607 --> 01:15:51.687
- # Yet now I'm standing here #
- # Now I'm standing here #

01:15:51.722 --> 01:15:55.564
# With heart so full
I can't explain #

01:15:55.599 --> 01:15:59.407
# Seeking faith
and speaking words #

01:15:59.442 --> 01:16:03.664
# I never thought I'd say #

01:16:03.699 --> 01:16:07.732
# There can be miracles #

01:16:07.767 --> 01:16:11.407
- # When you believe #
- # When you believe #

01:16:11.442 --> 01:16:14.572

01:16:14.607 --> 01:16:18.847

With this staff,

01:20:36.402 --> 01:20:38.804
you shall do...

01:20:38.839 --> 01:20:41.207
My wonders!

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:57.407
Leave it!

01:22:29.687 --> 01:22:31.327
Yeah, me too.

01:22:49.327 --> 01:22:52.327
Eeee-yaaaaah!

01:23:07.647 --> 01:23:11.207
Don't &ust stand there!
Kill them!

01:23:11.242 --> 01:23:13.647
Kill them all!

01:23:15.447 --> 01:23:19.007
The soldiers! They're coming!

01:23:21.087 --> 01:23:23.292
Moses! Moses!

01:23:23.327 --> 01:23:26.167
- Hurry! Hurry! I got you.
- Look! The shore!

01:23:50.007 --> 01:23:53.967
No!

01:25:20.647 --> 01:25:22.567
Thank you.

01:25:48.967 --> 01:25:52.887
Moses!

01:25:57.927 --> 01:26:02.167
Moses!

01:26:05.247 --> 01:26:07.087
Good-bye, brother.

01:26:16.607 --> 01:26:19.927

01:26:19.962 --> 01:26:22.412

# Ki ga-oh ga-ah #

01:26:28.047 --> 01:26:32.447
Look. Look at your people, Moses.

01:26:36.087 --> 01:26:38.007
They are free.

01:26:39.047 --> 01:26:42.847
# Na-chi-tah v'- chas-d'- cha #

01:26:42.882 --> 01:26:45.744
# Am zu ga-al-ta #

01:26:45.779 --> 01:26:48.607
# A-shi-ra, a-shi-ra #

01:26:48.642 --> 01:26:52.447
# A-shi-ra ##

01:27:39.407 --> 01:27:44.767
# Deliver us ##

01:27:53.567 --> 01:27:57.172
# Many nights we prayed #

01:27:57.207 --> 01:28:01.087
# With no proof
anyone could hear #

01:28:01.122 --> 01:28:04.967
# In our hearts
a hopeful song #

01:28:05.002 --> 01:28:08.864
# We barely understood #

01:28:08.899 --> 01:28:12.572
# Now we are not afraid #

01:28:12.607 --> 01:28:16.687
# Although we know
there's much to fear #

01:28:16.722 --> 01:28:19.292
# We were moving mountains #

01:28:19.327 --> 01:28:26.207
# Long before
we knew we could #

01:28:26.242 --> 01:28:28.572
# Ohhh-ohh, yes #

01:28:28.607 --> 01:28:32.127
# There can be miracles #

01:28:32.162 --> 01:28:35.584
# When you believe #

01:28:35.619 --> 01:28:39.593
# Though hope is frail #

01:28:39.628 --> 01:28:43.412
# It's hard to kill #

01:28:43.447 --> 01:28:47.047
# Who knows what miracles #

01:28:47.082 --> 01:28:50.464
# You can achieve #

01:28:50.499 --> 01:28:54.333
# When you believe #

01:28:54.368 --> 01:28:57.727
# Somehow you will #

01:28:57.762 --> 01:29:01.087
# You will when you #

01:29:01.122 --> 01:29:05.172
# Believe #

01:29:05.207 --> 01:29:08.927
- # Mmmm #
- # Oooh, yeah #

01:29:08.962 --> 01:29:12.172
# In this time of fear #

01:29:12.207 --> 01:29:16.027
# When prayer so often
proves in vain #

01:29:16.062 --> 01:29:19.847
# Hope seems like
the summer birds #

01:29:19.882 --> 01:29:23.624
# Too swiftly flown away #

01:29:23.659 --> 01:29:27.252
# Yet now I'm standing here #

01:29:27.287 --> 01:29:31.007
# My heart's so full
I can't explain #

01:29:31.042 --> 01:29:34.727
# Seeking faith
and speaking words #

01:29:34.762 --> 01:29:40.744
# I never thought I'd say #

01:29:40.779 --> 01:29:46.612
# There can be miracles #

01:29:46.647 --> 01:29:50.247
- # When you believe #
- # When you believe #

01:29:50.282 --> 01:29:54.004

01:30:11.848 --> 01:30:15.047
# You will when you #

01:30:15.082 --> 01:30:20.247
# Believe #

01:30:28.807 --> 01:30:31.407
# They don't always happen #

01:30:31.442 --> 01:30:34.527
# When you ask #

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:36.292
# Ah #

01:30:36.327 --> 01:30:39.367
# And it's easy to give in #

01:30:39.402 --> 01:30:41.892
# To your fears #

01:30:41.927 --> 01:30:43.692
- # Oooh #
- # Ohhh #

01:30:43.727 --> 01:30:47.132
# But when you're blinded
by your pain #

01:30:47.167 --> 01:30:50.787
# Can't see the way
to get through the rain #

01:30:50.822 --> 01:30:54.407
- # Hold still #
- # Reveal your voice #

01:30:54.442 --> 01:30:59.492
# Says help is very near
Ohhh #

01:30:59.527 --> 01:31:02.732
