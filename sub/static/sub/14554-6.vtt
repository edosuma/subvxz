WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.705
( wind whistling )

00:32.566 --> 00:35.269
( wind whistling )

01:19.613 --> 01:20.814
Thank you.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.655
* Life seems lonely *

01:27.721 --> 01:30.724
* And I'm by myself
again *

01:33.827 --> 01:36.664
* There's no use *

01:36.730 --> 01:39.600
* In trying to
pretend... **

01:39.667 --> 01:40.901
May I join you?

01:40.968 --> 01:42.336
Of course, please.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.706
Robin.
I'm Louie.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.575
Yeah, I know.
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.509
You too.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.344
Can I have
a cup of coffee?

01:55.916 --> 01:58.919
So... you knew Barney?

01:58.986 --> 02:00.588
Yeah, sure.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.526
Were you close?

02:05.593 --> 02:07.861
Um, well...

02:07.928 --> 02:11.064
I, uh,
I worked at the club.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.734
Oh, the Laugh Circuit.
Yeah.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.737
And what did you--
you were close to him?

02:16.804 --> 02:18.071
Were you...
I knew him.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.107
Did you-- were you--

02:20.174 --> 02:21.975
was he a friend of yours
or just...

02:22.042 --> 02:24.445
He was my ex-wife's
brother-in-law.

02:24.512 --> 02:27.481
So... he was
important to you.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.054
I'm pretty sure that Barney

02:34.121 --> 02:35.823
was the biggest piece
of shit I ever knew.

02:35.889 --> 02:39.493
Oh, yeah.
He was to me.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.129
( exhaling )
( laughing )

02:42.196 --> 02:43.864
I mean, he was
the worst guy ever maybe.

02:43.931 --> 02:44.998
Oh, yeah, I hated him.
Right?

02:45.065 --> 02:46.066
Yeah.
You hated him?

02:46.133 --> 02:47.301
Oh.
Hated him.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.837
A prick.
He was a prick
and an asshole.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.071
Hated him.
Oh...

02:51.138 --> 02:52.206
All the comics hated him.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.074
Serious?
Yep.

02:54.141 --> 02:55.209
He underpaid.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.777
He bounced checks.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.212
He, uh, lied.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.848
Just mean.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.916
You know, I knew that nobody
would be there today.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.117
Oh, God, yeah.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.753
And I-- like when he--

03:05.819 --> 03:08.055
This is weird, 'cause when
he died, I felt nothing.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.691
Ditto.
I didn't care.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.426
But I knew...

03:12.493 --> 03:15.028
when I pictured him
going in the ground

03:15.095 --> 03:18.699
and nobody's there,
he's alone...

03:18.766 --> 03:21.068
it gave me nightmares.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.670
Me too.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.308
I was married to
his wife's sister.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.076
I put money into
that club.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.512
You did?
About a half-million
dollars.

03:31.579 --> 03:34.315
And on top of that, he stole
another 100 grand from me.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.183
Jesus, really?
Oh, yeah.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.418
And I couldn't go after him.

03:37.485 --> 03:38.652
You know,
what can I do?

03:38.719 --> 03:40.621
He's family, so I had to...
let it go.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.390
And then
here's the worst part.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.024
He kept wanting to be pals
with me, y'know, hang out.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.026
He wouldn't let it go.

03:46.093 --> 03:48.862
He bought a boat with
the money he stole from me.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.098
He kept wanting me
to go out on the boat.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.200
Out on the boat that
he bought with money

03:53.267 --> 03:55.135
he stole from you?
Oh, yeah.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.604
That's amazing.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.638
You know,
the thing about him is,

03:57.705 --> 03:59.740
he wanted everybody
to like him,

03:59.807 --> 04:02.042
even when
he was killing them.
That was the thing
with that guy.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.677
He was like
that with everybody.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.013
I mean, he-- he begged comics
to hang out with him.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.648
He'd mistreat us

04:07.715 --> 04:09.216
but then after
the show he'd go,

04:09.283 --> 04:10.451
"Hey, uh, where are
we going?

04:10.518 --> 04:12.085
"Come on, let's hang out.

04:12.152 --> 04:13.153
"Where do
you want to go?

04:13.220 --> 04:14.355
"Come on, fellas.

04:14.422 --> 04:15.856
"Let's get in the limo.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.058
Let's go to
the strip club."
The strip club.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.260
The strip club.
Right.

04:20.328 --> 04:22.262
What was the name of the place
by the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel?

04:22.330 --> 04:24.197
Sweet Charity.
Sweet Charity.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.300
Every time I came to town,
he kept wanting me to
go down there with him.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.602
He'd go, "Hey, Robbie,
you gotta come down

04:28.669 --> 04:30.938
"and check out the tits
on this new Chilean broad

04:31.004 --> 04:31.939
down at Sweet Charity."

04:32.005 --> 04:34.107
( laughing )

04:34.174 --> 04:35.576
He begged
everybody to go there.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.778
Did you ever go there
with him?
No, not once.

04:37.845 --> 04:38.812
Never?
Never.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.548
I never went there,
either.
No.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.949
I don't know anybody who
went to that club with him.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.617
Not one time.
No...

04:48.456 --> 04:51.058
( rock music blaring )

04:58.065 --> 05:00.300
( man )
Gentleman,
for the next two minutes,

05:00.368 --> 05:03.437
all lap dances are
two for $20.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.838
Right now,
for your viewing pleasure,

05:04.905 --> 05:06.974
on the main stage we have
Amber Dambra

05:07.040 --> 05:09.176
and Supa-Loosa.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.779
Let's get those dollars flying
and those drinks flowing.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.821
You want a dance?

05:20.888 --> 05:22.723
Uh, no thank you.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.992
You?

05:25.058 --> 05:26.326
Oh, no,
no thank you.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.128
Thank you very much.
( sighing )

05:28.195 --> 05:30.130
Want a double dance?

05:30.197 --> 05:31.699
No thank you--
thank you.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.567
Yeah, thanks a lot.
I'm good.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.235
So you don't
want a dance?

05:35.302 --> 05:36.904
No.
No, no.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.672
We're-- not so much--
Then why are you
here, then?

05:38.739 --> 05:40.841
Well, uh...

05:40.908 --> 05:43.176
We, uh, we...

05:43.243 --> 05:46.113
A friend of ours,
uh, uh, died.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.382
Who died?

05:48.449 --> 05:51.619
Just a guy that we knew
who used to come here, so.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.986
I've been working here
for ten years.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.722
Who was he?

05:54.788 --> 05:56.557
Barney Ross.

05:57.425 --> 05:58.692
Barney Ross?

06:00.628 --> 06:04.031
Wait, I don't understand.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.699
Barney Ross is dead.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.571
Barney.

06:12.305 --> 06:13.574
I'm sorry.

06:14.942 --> 06:15.976
Come here.

06:17.411 --> 06:18.646
* Sister Christian *

06:18.712 --> 06:21.715
* Oh the time
has come *

06:23.751 --> 06:27.320
* And you know that
you're the only one *

06:27.387 --> 06:29.723
* To say... *

06:29.790 --> 06:32.225
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to interrupt

06:32.292 --> 06:34.562
the festivities here
at Sweet Charity for a moment

06:34.628 --> 06:38.298
but we need to pay tribute
right now

06:38.365 --> 06:40.267
to a man...

06:40.333 --> 06:42.470
quite frankly,
we all loved...

06:42.536 --> 06:45.405
who had passed away.

06:45.473 --> 06:48.308
A good man,
a generous man.

06:48.375 --> 06:51.078
Barney Ross.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.113
Barney...

06:53.180 --> 06:54.648
this one's for you, buddy.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.084
* Motorin' *

06:57.150 --> 07:00.888
* What's your
price for flight? *

07:02.956 --> 07:06.494
* In finding Mister Right *

07:08.529 --> 07:12.032
* You'll be all right
tonight *

07:17.237 --> 07:21.509
* Babe you know you're
growing up so fast *

07:23.611 --> 07:27.147
* And Mama's worryin' that
you won't last *

07:27.214 --> 07:28.516
* To say... *

07:31.118 --> 07:35.055
* Sister Christian
there's so much in life **

07:41.028 --> 07:43.330
( laughing )

07:43.396 --> 07:44.665
Oh.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.267
Hey, man, it was
nice to meet you.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.869
Same.
See ya.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.904
Hey, can you
do me a favor?
Yeah.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.439
If...

07:52.506 --> 07:53.674
Oh, I'll go to yours.
Yeah.

07:53.741 --> 07:55.008
Will you...
Whoever dies first.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.143
Okay, good.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.811
Take care, pal.
Good to see ya, take care.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.185
Come on, baby.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.920
Are we gonna go get
Jane now?

08:06.987 --> 08:09.022
No, she's with
your mom today.
Good.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.491
I want an alone day
with you.
Oh, nice.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.093
Me too.
What do you want to do?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.962
You want to get
something to eat?
I don't know.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.429
Hang out?

08:16.496 --> 08:17.665
Whatever you want--
Louie...

08:17.731 --> 08:20.033
I wonder if I could
ask you for a favor.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.535
Sure, what's up?

08:21.602 --> 08:24.037
I have an emergency
situation and I need--

08:24.104 --> 08:26.640
I'm wondering if you could
watch Never for me,

08:26.707 --> 08:28.341
maybe bring him
home for a play date

08:28.408 --> 08:29.777
and I can pick
him up later.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.045
Sure, you have
an emergency?

08:32.112 --> 08:33.480
What's wrong?

08:33.547 --> 08:35.115
I'm having my vagina
removed.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.186
I'm sorry.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.321
No, it's elective.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.757
I've chosen to
have it removed.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.025
But I have a consultation

08:45.092 --> 08:46.526
and they could
only do it today.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.395
Right.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.230
I have to do it now
to stay on schedule.

08:50.297 --> 08:53.734
I want to get rid of my
vagina before Easter.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.102
Okay, so you need--

08:55.168 --> 08:57.705
you need me to watch Never
while you do that?

08:57.771 --> 08:59.072
Yes, could you please?

08:59.139 --> 09:00.574
I know we're not friends

09:00.641 --> 09:02.375
but you're the only person
at this school

09:02.442 --> 09:05.512
that I feel I can
confide in or trust.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.748
( Lilly )
Daddy?
What?

09:07.815 --> 09:09.617
What?
Daddy, I don't want a
play date with Never.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.351
Baby, don't do that.

09:11.418 --> 09:12.385
Her mother
needs our help.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.187
But, Daddy!
No, no-- shh.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.789
I'm sorry.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.725
Okay, so you need me
to watch Never

09:17.791 --> 09:19.693
and then you go and...

09:19.760 --> 09:21.394
Yes!
Okay.

09:21.461 --> 09:22.796
That's--
we'll be happy to have him

09:22.863 --> 09:25.498
and just call me after
your thing.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.667
Thank you.
Sure.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.401
Oh, also,
I need you to know

09:28.468 --> 09:30.203
that I don't say
"no" to him.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.177
And he can't eat
anything with carbon in it.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.779
Carbon?

09:38.846 --> 09:41.081
It's all from China.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.315
Right.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.956
Do you have any food
at your house?

09:49.022 --> 09:51.491
Yeah, yeah,
we got plenty of food.

09:51.558 --> 09:52.926
We'll, uh...

09:52.993 --> 09:55.162
Daddy?
Baby, come here.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.464
Look.
Daddy, I really don't
want to play with him.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.132
I know, but his mom
needs our help.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.233
( woman screaming )

10:00.300 --> 10:01.368
( horns honking )

10:01.434 --> 10:03.937
( tires screeching )

10:06.940 --> 10:09.643
Holy shit!
Run, run!

10:09.710 --> 10:11.411
Get out of here!
Move, move!

10:11.478 --> 10:12.713
Get out of here!

10:19.753 --> 10:21.254
( sighing )

10:23.090 --> 10:24.725
All right, gang.

10:24.792 --> 10:25.959
So what do
we want to do?

10:26.026 --> 10:27.828
We wanna...
( door slamming )

10:33.100 --> 10:35.035
You hungry?

10:35.102 --> 10:36.103
Okay, come on.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.008
Carbon.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.813
Listen, um, Never,

10:45.879 --> 10:47.881
your mom told me that
you can't eat anything

10:47.948 --> 10:49.683
that has carbon in it.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.720
And I-- I, frankly,
I don't know what that means.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.988
So I'm going to need some
guidance from you, okay?

10:57.224 --> 10:58.191
Okay.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.062
Let's see.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.331
How about...
a peanut butter sandwich?

11:04.397 --> 11:06.133
I can't have that.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.401
Is it the peanuts
or the bread or what's the...

11:08.468 --> 11:09.469
I can't.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.772
My mom says I'll die.

11:11.839 --> 11:12.873
That's pretty serious.

11:12.940 --> 11:13.874
Do you have
an allergy?

11:13.941 --> 11:16.143
She says I'll die.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.745
Okay.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.379
How about some eggs?

11:19.446 --> 11:21.381
I'll make you
some eggs.

11:21.448 --> 11:24.051
Carrots?
I hate carrots.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.853
You want an apple?
I'll die.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.387
All right, listen, Never.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.222
I know your mom says
these things to you--
That.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.724
I can have that.

11:30.791 --> 11:31.959
A burger.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.027
Want me to
make you a burger?

11:34.094 --> 11:35.228
I can't have it
cooked.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.930
Just the meat.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.698
You want to eat it raw?
In a bowl.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.367
I have that a lot--
I like it.

11:40.433 --> 11:43.103
You want me to give you
raw meat in a bowl?

11:43.170 --> 11:45.705
Your mother
gives you that?
Yes.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.675
All right, you got it,
killer.

11:48.742 --> 11:49.476
( cell phone ringing )

11:49.542 --> 11:51.578
Oh, sorry.

11:51.644 --> 11:53.346
Hello?

11:53.413 --> 11:55.248
Hey, Louie, it's Doug.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.850
Hey, Doug.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.352
Hey, can you do a radio
interview in a few minutes?

11:59.419 --> 12:01.621
Uh, what for?

12:01.688 --> 12:03.690
Um, you're playing
Kansas City in two weeks

12:03.757 --> 12:05.893
and ticket sales are
a little soft.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.595
Oh, man, I told you not to
book me in Kansas City.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.898
I-- I--
They hate me there.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.766
I got you a live interview on
a major market station

12:12.833 --> 12:14.501
which should really help.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.904
You want me to-- you want
me to do radio right now?

12:16.970 --> 12:19.039
It's not even drive time.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.841
Doesn't matter, the economy's
really bad in KC.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.509
Nobody's at work anyway.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.878
The radio ratings have been
much higher in the afternoons.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.814
Yeah, but, Doug,
I hate doing radio shows.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.082
There's always some idiot
and his idiot friend.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.483
I know, I know,
but spend ten minutes

12:30.550 --> 12:31.852
with these guys
and you'll make

12:31.919 --> 12:33.253
way more money next week.
It's worth it.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.288
Can we just book me in,
like, a...

12:35.355 --> 12:36.890
a city where
people want to see me

12:36.957 --> 12:38.959
without having to listen to
some high-energy--

12:39.026 --> 12:40.727
Hey, I'm just telling you the
economics of the situation.

12:40.794 --> 12:41.594
I don't want you
to go to Kansas City

12:41.661 --> 12:43.730
and not make any money.

12:43.797 --> 12:46.166
Okay.
All right, I'll do it.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.235
I'm having them call you
in 15 minutes.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.502
Okay.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.637
All right,
talk to you later.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.105
Bye.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.107
These guys,
it's crazy.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.116
Never?

13:11.758 --> 13:13.760
Did you just throw
my rug out the window?

13:13.827 --> 13:15.262
So?

13:23.536 --> 13:24.437
Hey, that's my rug!

13:25.873 --> 13:27.540
Hey, that's--
that's my rug!

13:39.586 --> 13:41.421
Listen, I have an important
phone call to make

13:41.488 --> 13:43.857
so I need something that you
can do while I'm doing that.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.758
Can I play with Lilly?

13:45.825 --> 13:46.927
She's not into it.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.528
You want to
watch some TV?

13:48.595 --> 13:49.796
My mom doesn't allow it.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.798
Okay, but you're not
with your mom.

13:51.865 --> 13:54.034
You're with me
and I say it's okay.
It's not appropriate.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.805
All right, well,
what do you want to do?

13:58.872 --> 14:00.640
Can you give me a bath?

14:00.707 --> 14:01.875
You want to
take a bath?

14:01.942 --> 14:03.776
I want you to give me
a bath and wash me.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.578
That's not gonna happen.
Why?

14:05.645 --> 14:07.480
Because that's not
appropriate.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.449
Why?

14:10.884 --> 14:12.119
Look, you can
take a bath

14:12.185 --> 14:14.621
but you got to do it
by yourself, okay?

14:14.687 --> 14:16.356
Okay.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.457
All right, come on.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.133
Okay.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.268
All right, Never,
I'm gonna leave you to it.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.802
And I'm gonna ask you
that you just

14:29.869 --> 14:31.438
don't wreck anything.

14:31.504 --> 14:32.973
If you could just
sit peaceful in this tub

14:33.040 --> 14:35.875
while I'm on the phone.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.544
All right, look,
if you can keep it cool

14:37.610 --> 14:38.912
while I'm on the phone,

14:38.979 --> 14:41.681
I'll give you another
bowl of meat, okay?

14:41.748 --> 14:43.150
Okay.
All right.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.084
Good luck.
( cell phone ringing )

14:44.151 --> 14:46.253
Oh, there's my call.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.587
Hello?

14:47.654 --> 14:48.755
( man )
Hi, is this Louie?

14:48.821 --> 14:50.157
Yeah.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.858
I'm Jeff,
I produce the show.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.860
We're gonna have you on the
air in one minute, okay?

14:53.927 --> 14:55.562
Okay.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.564
Okay, you'll be on with
Tracer, Pig

14:57.630 --> 14:59.399
and The Hole is Diane.

14:59.466 --> 15:00.934
The Hole?

15:01.001 --> 15:02.335
You're gonna hear
some music right now

15:02.402 --> 15:04.037
and then you'll be on
with the guys.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.006
Just sit tight, thanks.
Okay, thank you.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.814
( man )
That's better, Di!

15:14.881 --> 15:16.149
Coming down, Chow Down!

15:16.216 --> 15:18.251
( man )
That's what the back says!

15:18.318 --> 15:20.653
( woman )
Don't!
It's the "MamaJamJamSound."

15:20.720 --> 15:22.289
We've got
Louis CK on the line.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.590
Hi.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.625
All right.
Hi, Louie.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.060
Hi.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.028
Hey, thanks for
coming on "Chow Down."

15:28.095 --> 15:29.429
We've gotta take time.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.331
Take time.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.166
Well, thank you
for having me.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.835
Louie CK
is all-time funny-funny.

15:35.902 --> 15:38.071
Ah, he's funny.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.207
And just "jammy"
he's going to be at

15:40.273 --> 15:42.375
the Stanford and Son
Comedy Club

15:42.442 --> 15:44.777
next week, from Thursday
through Saturday night.

15:44.844 --> 15:47.747
You can get tickets by going
to StanfordsComedyClub.com.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.382
That's right.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.152
So, Louie, hey, what do you
think of the whole

15:52.219 --> 15:53.886
"clammy down chow" thing

15:53.953 --> 15:55.555
going down at
the "rowdy down"?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.157
I wouldn't want to be that guy,
you know, he sounds like

15:57.224 --> 15:58.658
he's in a lot of trouble.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.061
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, my God!

16:01.128 --> 16:03.663
That's a "cramadiga."

16:03.730 --> 16:05.532
( speaking gibberish )

16:05.598 --> 16:07.200
Ah, Pig, shut up!

16:07.267 --> 16:08.968
Wow, that's a "cramalaco."

16:09.036 --> 16:10.670
Aye-ya-ya!

16:10.737 --> 16:13.206
And what about the guy on
the cover of the "Cham Dow"?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.075
He might be a little
chatty.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.210
Ah, well, you know,
maybe, right?

16:17.277 --> 16:18.378
Ha-ha.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.947
Louie CK.
Ah, that's so bad.

16:21.014 --> 16:24.251
Louie CK is going to be at the
Stanford and Sons Comedy Club

16:24.317 --> 16:26.186
Thursday through
Saturday night.

16:26.253 --> 16:29.622
Get your tickets now at
StanfordsComedyClub.com.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.491
Louie!
Yeah?

16:31.558 --> 16:34.161
You ever go to
"Dime-A-Dime Penny"?

16:34.227 --> 16:35.928
Yeah, sure,
I'm a single guy-- why not?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.097
Whoa!
Don't!

16:37.164 --> 16:38.565
There goes
a loud "shebang."

16:38.631 --> 16:40.833
I might wear a couple
condoms, though.
Oh!

16:40.900 --> 16:43.970
Louie CK,
a dirty, dirty guy.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.438
Louie, hey, what do you think

16:45.505 --> 16:47.640
of the "bat-a-bomb"
about Kansas City?

16:47.707 --> 16:49.309
Oh, Kansas City.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.244
Well, I've been going there
to work the clubs

16:51.311 --> 16:52.645
for the last
ten years or so...

16:52.712 --> 16:54.247
Uh-huh.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.882
...and I'd have to say
Kansas City

16:55.948 --> 16:57.950
is the worst town
I've ever been in.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.720
I mean, what a dump, right?

17:00.787 --> 17:02.989
It's got to be
the worst city in North America.

17:03.056 --> 17:06.493
And that includes Mexico
and Canada.

17:08.995 --> 17:10.630
Hello?

17:10.697 --> 17:13.700
Okay, Louie CK, hey,
thanks for coming on the air.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.703
Oh, okay, uh...

17:16.769 --> 17:18.338
Hello?
( Lilly )
Daddy!

17:18.405 --> 17:21.374
Daddy, something smells really
bad coming from the bathroom.

17:21.441 --> 17:22.742
Oh, no.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.111
Jesus!

17:25.978 --> 17:27.514
Damn it.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.786
Never, what...

17:33.853 --> 17:35.922
What is that?

17:35.988 --> 17:37.557
Oh.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.126
Oh, my God.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.927
I "diarrheaed" in the tub.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.529
( Lilly )
Oh, my God!

17:42.595 --> 17:44.197
Daddy, ew!

17:44.264 --> 17:46.166
Okay, go, go,
get-- get out of here!

17:46.233 --> 17:48.735
( Lilly )
That is so gross.

17:48.801 --> 17:49.936
I "diarrheaed."
Uh-huh.

17:50.002 --> 17:51.538
Okay, uh.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.810
Uh, okay, we're gonna...

17:57.877 --> 17:59.312
You're gonna...

17:59.379 --> 18:02.782
Um, I'm gonna
drain the tub.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.118
Okay, you're gonna
step out.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.154
I'm gonna
lay this down, okay?

18:07.220 --> 18:08.821
Here's what we're
gonna do...

18:17.230 --> 18:18.631
( sighing )

18:26.473 --> 18:30.009
Listen, Never, I don't--
I don't know what your deal is.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.578
I know it's just you
and your mom.

18:34.647 --> 18:35.782
I just want to--

18:35.848 --> 18:37.617
I just want to say that
if you ever need to

18:37.684 --> 18:39.352
talk about anything,

18:39.419 --> 18:41.087
you know we see
each other in school,

18:41.154 --> 18:45.258
so if you need to,
you can talk to me.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.627
Talk about what?

18:47.694 --> 18:49.162
Well, you know,
that's up to you.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.663
It doesn't matter.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.932
If you think of something
you need to talk about--

18:52.999 --> 18:56.636
You might not.
I'm just saying.

18:56.703 --> 18:57.970
You can talk to me.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.106
Lilly doesn't like me.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.441
Nope.

19:01.508 --> 19:04.611
No, she does not.
Why?

19:04.677 --> 19:07.947
Because you eat raw meat
and you shit in the tub

19:08.014 --> 19:10.517
and you wreck everything.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.084
And as long
as you act like that,

19:12.151 --> 19:13.553
no one's going to
like you.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.655
No one's going to
want to be around you.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.924
My mom says that any choice
I make is okay

19:17.990 --> 19:19.692
because I love myself.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.730
Your...

19:23.796 --> 19:25.498
your mom is wrong.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.099
I'm gonna tell her
you said that.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.801
That's okay,
you tell her.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.503
I'll take the heat.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.851
( knocking )

19:44.917 --> 19:46.353
Oh, that's her,
come on.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.658
( wind whistling )

19:56.663 --> 20:03.536
( speaking foreign language )

20:09.642 --> 20:11.811
I told you before, man,
I don't--

20:11.878 --> 20:13.513
I don't understand African.

20:13.580 --> 20:17.550
( speaking foreign language )

20:17.617 --> 20:19.386
Look, I don't understand what
the hell you're talking about.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.753
If you want to talk to me,

20:20.820 --> 20:23.990
talk to me with
useful stuff, okay?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.858
Oops, I farted.
Okay?

20:25.925 --> 20:27.294
See how cool that is?

20:27.360 --> 20:29.629
All right,
all right, all right?

20:29.696 --> 20:32.098
This dude right here is being
buried in an IKEA shelf.

20:32.164 --> 20:34.901
Look at this dude,
man-- you kidding me?

20:34.967 --> 20:36.436
Since you don't understand what
the hell I'm talking about,

20:36.503 --> 20:38.371
I gotta go to
the adult learning center

20:38.438 --> 20:40.540
to learn African so I can
come back to work

20:40.607 --> 20:41.774
and be able to tell you that

20:41.841 --> 20:43.343
I don't want to hear
that African shit.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.945
( speaking foreign language )

20:48.648 --> 20:49.849
I hate you.
