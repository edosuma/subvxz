WEBVTT

00:17.957 --> 00:18.957
I heard your prayer.

00:19.125 --> 00:21.616
The angel lied to me.
He's not who he said he was.

00:21.828 --> 00:25.229
Gadreel.
- Gadreel is working for Metatron?

00:25.431 --> 00:27.399
Metatron made Gadreel kill Kevin.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.865
I was the one who caused
all the angels to fall.

00:31.070 --> 00:33.937
- He took my grace for the spell.
- That means you're human.

00:34.140 --> 00:35.140
Long live the queen.

00:39.412 --> 00:41.004
It's the bloody
Mark of Cain.

00:42.849 --> 00:44.874
Without the Mark,
the Blade is useless.

00:45.084 --> 00:48.281
You're supposed
to lead the angels, Castiel.

00:50.223 --> 00:51.703
I'm just trying
to get my people home.

00:54.627 --> 00:56.925
You are not the hero.

00:58.798 --> 00:59.798
I'm the hero.

01:01.367 --> 01:04.928
You don't know
what it's like to be human!

01:08.575 --> 01:11.669
I'm starting to think the Blade
is doing something to you.

01:12.312 --> 01:15.110
Have you told them about
your stolen grace, Castiel?

01:15.315 --> 01:16.839
- Punish him.
- I can't.

01:17.050 --> 01:19.041
You just gave up
an entire army for one guy.

01:20.386 --> 01:22.106
He's powering up
with the Angel Tablet.

01:22.222 --> 01:23.416
Metatron's secret portal.

01:23.623 --> 01:25.543
From here on out,
I'm calling the shots. Capisce?

01:25.658 --> 01:28.650
I'm not here to fight.
At least give me a chance.

01:39.205 --> 01:40.672
- Drop the Blade, Dean!
- Move.

01:41.507 --> 01:43.566
- Dean...
- Sam, move!

01:45.178 --> 01:46.509
Let it go!

01:46.713 --> 01:48.510
Let it go! Let it go.

01:53.186 --> 01:54.915
The hell if you think I'm riding
the pine on this one, guys.

01:55.121 --> 01:56.520
Something is wrong with you, Dean.

01:56.723 --> 02:00.250
And until we figure out what,
this is where you have to stay.

02:00.460 --> 02:04.328
And you two are gonna do what?
Take on Metatron yourselves?

02:04.530 --> 02:08.830
That's smart. Oh, no, wait.
No, you... You lost your Angel army.

02:09.035 --> 02:11.663
And you... Now you're trying
to lock up the one guy

02:11.871 --> 02:15.534
who has a shot at killing
the son of a bitch!

02:15.742 --> 02:17.835
Hell of a plan, fellas!

02:24.617 --> 02:26.881
Look, hey, guys.

02:28.755 --> 02:29.755
Sam.

02:30.290 --> 02:31.484
Sammy.

02:32.625 --> 02:34.422
- Sam.
- Yeah?

02:35.628 --> 02:39.189
Dean wasn't wrong.
My followers have abandoned us.

02:39.399 --> 02:41.833
Yeah, and Gadreel says
he can help us.

02:42.035 --> 02:45.562
From where I sit,
that's more than an even trade.

03:31.884 --> 03:34.375
So, uh... Metatron.

03:36.989 --> 03:37.989
Metatron.

03:40.626 --> 03:43.720
- God?
- Just a second.

03:43.930 --> 03:46.091
That the new Angel handbook
you're working on, or?

03:46.299 --> 03:50.599
No, no. This is a story, Neil.

03:50.803 --> 03:56.571
A marvelous story,
full of love and heartbreak

03:56.776 --> 03:59.006
and... love.

03:59.212 --> 04:00.270
Sort of like The Notebook.

04:02.181 --> 04:05.173
- I love The Notebook.
- Uh, no.

04:08.354 --> 04:11.255
Quick.
Which makes me look more pathetic?

04:11.424 --> 04:14.587
Why do you want to look pathetic?
You've just reunited all the angels

04:14.794 --> 04:16.351
under the banner of Heaven.
I mean, that's like...

04:16.596 --> 04:18.223
Winning a People's Choice Award?

04:18.731 --> 04:20.562
Not quite the real deal, now, is it?

04:21.868 --> 04:23.961
- All set?
- Yes, sir. Uh...

04:24.504 --> 04:25.664
- Flip the switch...
- Uh-huh.

04:25.872 --> 04:27.169
Wait for the light, and bingo.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.603
And every angel in Heaven
and on earth will hear me?

04:30.810 --> 04:35.042
You and only you. The signal blocks
out all other voices on angel radio.

04:36.649 --> 04:38.412
Come on.

04:44.424 --> 04:46.119
Hello?

04:46.325 --> 04:48.486
This is Metatron.

04:49.729 --> 04:53.495
- More reverb.
- Because I'm Lou Gehrig?

04:55.268 --> 04:57.600
Sorry. Sorry.

04:58.905 --> 05:00.065
Don't do that.

05:05.077 --> 05:07.773
I'd like to take a moment
to welcome you all back.

05:08.014 --> 05:11.245
I want you to know how moved I am

05:11.451 --> 05:14.943
that you've accepted me
as your new God.

05:15.121 --> 05:19.820
My heart, as they say, is full.

05:21.194 --> 05:25.062
Which is why I want to share
some wonderful news with you.

05:25.231 --> 05:27.529
I'm going on a short trip.

05:27.767 --> 05:30.531
Heaven's door
will be temporarily closed

05:30.736 --> 05:35.105
pending my return, but rest assured,
all will be explained.

05:35.308 --> 05:40.541
And it will be... glorious.

05:49.222 --> 05:53.386
- Where are you going?
- To tell the rest of the story.

06:06.706 --> 06:09.504
Please.
I'll leave you alone, I swear.

06:09.709 --> 06:11.574
We're not here to hurt you.

06:12.512 --> 06:15.208
No. Your grace.

06:15.414 --> 06:17.848
Healing me will only weaken you.

06:25.091 --> 06:30.154
- Did you hear him?
- Metatron. Yes.

06:30.363 --> 06:32.024
Where is he going?
What does he want?

06:33.900 --> 06:36.630
I'm afraid, humanity.

06:40.907 --> 06:43.341
Oh, God!

06:43.543 --> 06:46.034
I would have thought
you'd be more relaxed,

06:46.212 --> 06:49.511
- having defeated Abaddon.
- What can I say?

06:49.682 --> 06:51.877
I wear my stress.

06:55.454 --> 06:56.614
You know...

06:58.190 --> 07:01.887
...with so many demons having
rallied back to your side,

07:02.094 --> 07:05.359
well, it's only natural that
they would look to their king

07:05.565 --> 07:08.728
for some... direction.

07:10.403 --> 07:13.895
Love, if I wanted
a soapy massage from Dr. Phil,

07:14.140 --> 07:15.903
I would have hit three
on the speed dial, all right?

07:16.142 --> 07:18.838
I'm sorry, sir.

07:23.583 --> 07:26.074
Sir, I believe
you're being summoned.

07:28.054 --> 07:29.919
It's a Winchester.

07:38.531 --> 07:40.396
What's that smell?

07:45.071 --> 07:47.505
What the hell's happening to me,
you son of a bitch?

07:48.274 --> 07:50.765
Liquor before beer, bad taco?
How should I know?

07:50.977 --> 07:52.706
I can't turn it off!

07:53.245 --> 07:57.705
Ever since I killed Abaddon,
it's like this whole other thing.

07:57.917 --> 08:00.784
I get this high,
and I need to kill.

08:00.987 --> 08:02.784
I mean, I really,
really need to kill.

08:02.989 --> 08:05.219
- And if I don't...
- You yak your guts out.

08:08.661 --> 08:10.891
- It's the Mark.
- Meaning?

08:11.097 --> 08:12.894
It wants you to kill.

08:13.099 --> 08:14.327
The more you kill,
the better you feel.

08:14.533 --> 08:16.592
The less you kill,
the less better you feel.

08:18.404 --> 08:19.428
How much less better?

08:19.639 --> 08:23.075
One would imagine
the least-best better.

08:25.311 --> 08:26.938
So, dead?

08:29.482 --> 08:31.002
Well, Cain had the Mark.
He didn't die.

08:31.117 --> 08:32.812
Cain was a demon.

08:33.019 --> 08:35.817
Your body's not strong enough
to contain the Blade's power.

08:38.024 --> 08:40.457
- What if I got rid of it?
- You want to get rid of it?

08:44.664 --> 08:47.724
- What I want is Metatron.
- Go on.

08:47.933 --> 08:51.369
But I have to get through that door,
and I have to get to the Blade.

08:54.140 --> 08:55.266
And you're gonna help me.

09:00.413 --> 09:02.904
Oh, no. What's that smell?

09:04.050 --> 09:05.642
Sulfur.

09:14.226 --> 09:16.660
Dean, pick up the phone.
Call me back.

09:16.829 --> 09:21.391
I'm not kidding, all right?
Don't do this. Not like this.

09:22.601 --> 09:27.038
- Are you sure it was Crowley?
- Who else would he summon?

09:27.273 --> 09:29.138
I mean, he and Crowley
have been bromancing

09:29.341 --> 09:31.400
over the Blade ever since
Dean got the Mark.

09:31.644 --> 09:34.044
- The Mark?
- The Mark of Cain.

09:35.448 --> 09:38.144
So that's what Dean cut me with,
the First Blade.

09:40.019 --> 09:43.216
- In a way, that could be useful.
- What?

09:43.389 --> 09:45.323
Well, Metatron's
more powerful than ever,

09:45.491 --> 09:47.721
but if Dean has the First Blade
and the Mark,

09:47.927 --> 09:50.487
that might give us our best chance.

09:51.731 --> 09:53.198
You're joking, right?

09:53.833 --> 09:55.801
An hour ago, we were ready
to throw Dean into a padded cell,

09:56.001 --> 09:57.441
and now you say
he's our best chance?

09:57.570 --> 09:58.867
Hear him out, Sam.

09:59.271 --> 10:01.102
Oh, right. Excuse me. Sorry, guys.

10:01.407 --> 10:03.705
Sorry I'm a little less than eager
to hear that our best chance

10:03.876 --> 10:06.902
is arming the warhead
and hoping it hits the mark.

10:07.113 --> 10:09.843
This is not a bomb we're
talking about. This is my brother.

10:10.049 --> 10:12.711
And your brother would not be
in this alone. We can help.

10:12.885 --> 10:15.183
- How?
- I believe Metatron has found a way

10:15.387 --> 10:17.287
to tap into the Angel Tablet,

10:17.490 --> 10:20.015
harnessing its power to give him
powers equivalent to...

10:20.226 --> 10:23.821
God, right? I mean, that's
what this is all about, isn't it?

10:24.063 --> 10:26.190
Metatron wants to be God.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.932
Great, well, that basically
makes him unstoppable.

10:30.136 --> 10:34.095
Not if we can break the connection
between Metatron and the Tablet.

10:34.306 --> 10:35.986
That would make him
just an ordinary angel.

10:37.409 --> 10:39.049
- Where's the Tablet?
- Metatron's office.

10:39.145 --> 10:40.705
- In Heaven?
- I can get us to the door.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.405
And then what? I mean,
why would they let you in?

10:43.616 --> 10:46.585
If Metatron's number two shows up
with Heaven's most wanted,

10:46.786 --> 10:48.777
- the gig is up.
- Sam, we have to try.

10:50.256 --> 10:52.383
Damn it, Al, I don't care what
you've got going on tonight.

10:52.558 --> 10:54.856
He's your kid, too,
and I'm telling you he's on drugs.

10:59.431 --> 11:01.797
- Oh, my God!
- Call 911!

11:02.568 --> 11:05.503
Oh, my God.

11:05.638 --> 11:09.233
She's dead, man! She's dead!

11:09.441 --> 11:12.672
I'm not so sure about that.

11:33.966 --> 11:36.526
- What can I get you fellas?
- Coffee. Black.

11:36.735 --> 11:38.100
Are you serious?

11:38.304 --> 11:40.101
You take this girl's table,
her time,

11:40.306 --> 11:42.740
you spread out like an overgrown
teenager, and for what?

11:42.942 --> 11:45.536
What's the tip
on a single cup of joe? A nickel?

11:47.313 --> 11:50.111
Double cheeseburger,
everything, heavy on the onions.

11:50.316 --> 11:51.544
You got it.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.748
So this is what you and Moose do, eh?

11:57.957 --> 12:00.448
Crisscross the country,
searching for evil.

12:01.660 --> 12:06.290
Order your nitrates,
partake of the local attraction.

12:06.498 --> 12:07.192
Yep.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.459
You never get tired of the rat race?

12:08.634 --> 12:12.126
Never get the urge to just bugger off
and howl at the moon?

12:13.505 --> 12:18.875
Never ask yourself, "Is this it?
Is this all there is?"

12:23.415 --> 12:25.474
I kicked human blood, you know.

12:25.651 --> 12:28.142
Oh, so you're
full-metal douche again.

12:28.354 --> 12:30.515
Well, that's fantastic.
Would you like a stuffed bear?

12:30.723 --> 12:32.884
Just trying to make conversation.

12:34.260 --> 12:36.785
- How's Hell, Crowley?
- Hell's fine.

12:37.997 --> 12:41.489
Hell's like a Swiss watch.
Don't worry about Hell.

12:43.202 --> 12:45.693
- Hell's complicated.
- Game of Thrones is complicated.

12:45.905 --> 12:48.237
Shower sex, that's complicated.
Hell ain't complicated.

12:48.440 --> 12:51.068
Your problem ain't Hell.
It's you.

12:51.277 --> 12:53.404
Fair enough.
What's your problem, then?

12:53.579 --> 12:55.547
My problem is Metatron.

12:55.748 --> 12:57.875
Right now there's nothing.

12:58.117 --> 13:00.984
There's no angel smitings,
no crazy acts of God,

13:01.220 --> 13:02.619
no vermin, hail.

13:02.821 --> 13:04.789
If Metatron's making
his move on earth,

13:04.957 --> 13:07.289
he is taking
his sweet-ass time.

13:09.495 --> 13:11.258
Never fear. Cavalry's here.

13:26.979 --> 13:28.037
And?

13:28.247 --> 13:32.274
Apparently...
your angel has gone viral.

13:33.152 --> 13:36.053
And that, America, is perfection.

13:36.255 --> 13:38.655
Yo, dude, that's your sister.

13:42.795 --> 13:44.558
Oh, my God!

13:45.531 --> 13:48.557
She's dead, man!
She's dead.

13:48.734 --> 13:50.599
I'm not so sure about that.

13:55.174 --> 13:57.699
Is he ser...
Is he freaking serious?!

13:57.910 --> 14:00.208
Did you see that? Holy...

14:01.180 --> 14:03.307
Tell me you just got that.

14:07.987 --> 14:11.514
- Dude, what's your name?
- Marv.

14:13.459 --> 14:15.324
- When was this taken?
- A couple of hours ago.

14:15.527 --> 14:17.567
- Muncie, Indiana.
- What did he whisper in her ear?

14:17.730 --> 14:18.788
Exactly.

14:23.769 --> 14:26.169
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're not gonna eat your food?

14:30.943 --> 14:32.342
Not hungry.

14:40.786 --> 14:43.118
The door to Heaven
is in a playground?

14:43.956 --> 14:46.049
Guarded by two
of Metatron's most loyal.

14:46.392 --> 14:48.155
I recruited them myself.

14:48.794 --> 14:50.819
So, you said you had a plan.

14:51.030 --> 14:53.021
How we might convince them
to let us pass.

14:56.035 --> 14:57.093
Wookiee.

15:00.406 --> 15:02.840
Brother, I have no idea
what that means.

15:03.042 --> 15:06.375
It's a reference to a very
popular film that...

15:07.246 --> 15:09.009
Never mind.

15:18.791 --> 15:21.123
Asariel.

15:22.795 --> 15:26.026
- Asariel, Purah, make way.
- The door's closed, Gadreel,

15:26.265 --> 15:27.857
by orders of Metatron.

15:28.067 --> 15:30.797
And who do you think gave
the order to capture Castiel?

15:31.003 --> 15:32.800
Unless you think Metatron
isn't interested

15:33.005 --> 15:34.973
in questioning the leader
of the rebellion?

15:38.444 --> 15:42.505
- The spell must be redrawn.
- As quickly as possible, then.

15:51.023 --> 15:52.615
I got this.

15:57.996 --> 15:59.725
I guess one of us
doesn't need a demon

15:59.932 --> 16:01.832
to help follow a clue trail.

16:04.570 --> 16:06.731
You're looking
for miracle lady, right?

16:06.939 --> 16:09.019
Yeah, she's gone. I had a nice chat
with her, though.

16:09.108 --> 16:10.905
Sam, whatever kind of
intervention you think this is,

16:11.110 --> 16:12.441
trust me, it ain't.

16:12.644 --> 16:14.044
I'm not gonna
explain myself to you.

16:14.213 --> 16:16.374
Yeah, I sort of got that. I just
thought you might like to know

16:16.582 --> 16:18.812
that while you two have been
playing Odd Couple,

16:19.017 --> 16:23.647
your real friends, like Cass,
like the angel you stabbed, Gadreel,

16:23.856 --> 16:26.188
they're out there right now
risking their asses

16:26.391 --> 16:27.551
to help you win this fight.

16:27.693 --> 16:28.717
What the hell are you talking about?

16:28.827 --> 16:29.827
A fight, I might add,

16:29.862 --> 16:31.625
you made that much more complicated
when you decided

16:31.797 --> 16:35.096
to stab the one angel who could
actually get us to Metatron.

16:35.267 --> 16:37.235
You mean the angel that took you
for a joy ride?

16:37.436 --> 16:39.196
The angel that slaughtered Kevin?
That angel?

16:39.238 --> 16:41.832
Who you let in the front door
in the first place.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.405
You tricked me, Dean.

16:43.609 --> 16:46.043
And now I'm the one who wakes up
in the middle of the night

16:46.245 --> 16:48.475
seeing my hands killing Kevin,
not you!

16:48.714 --> 16:51.842
So, please, when you say
you don't want to explain

16:52.084 --> 16:56.487
anything to me... don't.
I get it.

16:59.992 --> 17:05.487
And I also get
that Metatron has to go.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.657
And I know you're our best shot
to do that.

17:13.638 --> 17:17.665
I'm gonna take my shot,
for better or worse.

17:20.712 --> 17:23.044
- I know.
- No matter the consequences.

17:24.316 --> 17:25.510
I know.

17:28.287 --> 17:31.723
But if this is it,
we're gonna do it together.

17:33.458 --> 17:36.518
You want to know what he whispered
to her, right? In the video?

17:37.963 --> 17:39.453
His next stop.

17:40.732 --> 17:43.701
So what are we all
gollywagging on about? Chop-chop.

17:45.837 --> 17:50.467
Excuse me. I'm not exactly
demon minion number three here.

17:50.676 --> 17:52.371
As the kids say,
I've got mad skills.

17:52.578 --> 17:54.218
I don't know
what you expected here, okay?

17:54.413 --> 17:55.812
I don't really care,

17:56.048 --> 17:59.711
but you wanted off
the hamster wheel. Get off.

18:01.987 --> 18:05.150
Well... I guess
I've been Winchestered.

18:05.591 --> 18:09.220
I'd wish you boys good luck,
if I thought it would help.

18:41.193 --> 18:44.219
Well done.
We've sent word to Metatron.

18:44.396 --> 18:46.421
He'll be back shortly.
You can wait inside.

18:46.632 --> 18:48.964
Thank you, Ingrid.

19:00.646 --> 19:02.705
What's going on?

19:03.482 --> 19:05.609
No, no, no, no! Not here!

19:05.817 --> 19:08.012
Did you really think
your little ruse would work?

19:09.488 --> 19:12.457
Please. Please!

19:13.558 --> 19:15.150
Welcome to Heaven's jail, Castiel.

19:15.327 --> 19:18.296
I believe Gadreel
can give you the tour.

19:39.051 --> 19:40.643
Excuse me?

19:42.888 --> 19:46.289
I'm sorry, but are you Marv?

19:54.800 --> 19:57.234
This is my friend, George.

19:57.436 --> 19:59.495
I hear you perform miracles.

20:00.806 --> 20:02.398
It is a burden I accept.

20:02.607 --> 20:04.939
- A little single malt?
- George.

20:05.177 --> 20:06.610
- What?
- How about we take care

20:06.812 --> 20:07.812
of that diabetes?

20:17.823 --> 20:19.882
Left you a little something
to celebrate with.

20:20.892 --> 20:22.416
Thank you.

20:24.096 --> 20:25.427
He's a fraud!

20:27.566 --> 20:29.693
I'm afraid I don't know
what you mean, good sir.

20:30.669 --> 20:33.900
How can one be a fraud
when one offers nothing?

20:34.106 --> 20:36.700
A little love, a little hope...

20:36.908 --> 20:39.468
the occasional miracle.
Nothing more.

20:39.678 --> 20:42.977
You know exactly
what I mean, Metatron.

20:43.215 --> 20:44.807
Excuse me?

20:45.016 --> 20:46.176
His name is Metatron.

20:46.385 --> 20:51.254
And much as he'd like you to think,
he's not one of you.

20:51.423 --> 20:52.720
He's an angel.

20:52.958 --> 20:55.358
- We both are.
- An angel?

20:55.594 --> 20:57.494
Okay.

20:57.696 --> 21:00.665
Somebody's been drinking
out of George's canteen.

21:00.866 --> 21:02.663
So you deny you're
the former scribe of God.

21:02.868 --> 21:05.928
- Sir...
- A petty, unliked, unloved angel...

21:06.138 --> 21:08.470
These people don't want to hear...
...driven by the relentless pursuit

21:08.673 --> 21:10.664
- of power and nothing more.
- This has really gone too far.

21:10.876 --> 21:13.037
Who's already brought the rest
of the angels under his iron thumb.

21:13.245 --> 21:15.110
As I will you, brother,
if you don't...

21:15.347 --> 21:18.009
Shut your mouth!

21:18.250 --> 21:21.310
- Angel? Scribe of God? Please.
- It's true.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.387
What is true is what I can see
with my own two eyes.

21:24.623 --> 21:28.218
You want to call him
pathetic, common?

21:28.427 --> 21:30.861
Be my guest.
Who here isn't?

21:31.062 --> 21:34.964
But who here has the gift
that this man has?

21:36.168 --> 21:37.226
Do you know what he did?

21:37.436 --> 21:39.597
And I'm afraid
if you'd seen what I've seen,

21:39.805 --> 21:42.797
you'd think of him as nothing more
than an abomination.

21:43.542 --> 21:45.134
Abomination?

21:45.343 --> 21:47.470
Try miracle worker!

21:48.013 --> 21:49.810
- Try Messiah.
- Better.

21:50.015 --> 21:52.347
I am sorry you don't believe me.

21:52.551 --> 21:55.418
But I must do
what my mission demands.

21:55.654 --> 21:57.679
I must protect you.

21:59.224 --> 22:00.987
Yeah, that's not gonna...

22:06.565 --> 22:07.565
They love me.

22:08.667 --> 22:11.534
They really, really love me.

22:17.242 --> 22:18.800
A little help.

22:46.071 --> 22:49.199
- Anything?
- Yeah. He's up there.

22:49.441 --> 22:53.207
About a mile up the road.
There's a homeless encampment.

22:53.411 --> 22:55.003
The way the folks are talking,
he's got them convinced

22:55.146 --> 22:58.115
he's some kind of... new Jesus
or something.

22:59.818 --> 23:01.012
You good?

23:01.820 --> 23:03.014
Yeah, I'm good.

23:18.069 --> 23:23.439
Listen, Sammy, about... you know,
the last couple of months...

23:23.642 --> 23:25.132
I know.

23:27.746 --> 23:31.876
So before we find something
else to fight about...

23:33.151 --> 23:34.641
tell me...

23:36.454 --> 23:38.046
Are you ready to gut this bitch?

23:50.402 --> 23:54.270
Sorry, little brother.
It's not your fight.

23:59.411 --> 24:03.006
Okay, so you're telling me
that Metatron set you up,

24:03.214 --> 24:07.173
arranged those suicide bombers to
make himself look like the victim.

24:07.352 --> 24:09.912
Gadreel is his
second in command.

24:10.121 --> 24:13.921
For what other reason than the truth
would he turn against Metatron?

24:14.125 --> 24:16.116
So now I'm expected
to trust the word of an angel

24:16.328 --> 24:20.321
who's only ever thought
of himself since the Garden, and you?

24:21.499 --> 24:24.957
You told us not a single angel more
would die in this fight.

24:25.170 --> 24:28.401
What do you think
I have been trying to do?

24:28.607 --> 24:31.041
Trying? By killing Metatron?

24:31.242 --> 24:34.678
He is the reason
for all of our suffering.

24:35.046 --> 24:38.209
- Nothing you say matters.
- Would you rather I not try at all?

24:38.450 --> 24:39.678
Not if you can't prove it.

24:39.884 --> 24:41.476
So give us a chance.

24:43.154 --> 24:45.622
Let us out, Hannah. Please.

24:54.165 --> 24:56.156
Can I help you?

24:56.368 --> 24:57.733
Take it easy, chief.

24:58.370 --> 24:59.803
You're Dean Winchester.

25:00.839 --> 25:03.239
- Now, how did you know that?
- He said you were coming.

25:06.511 --> 25:09.639
Well, here I am.
Where's Metatron?

25:09.848 --> 25:13.716
- Marv.
- Sure.

25:13.918 --> 25:15.442
In there.

25:17.956 --> 25:20.083
Praying for our forgiveness.

25:20.291 --> 25:22.623
Forgiveness for what?

25:26.665 --> 25:28.633
Is he, now?

25:46.084 --> 25:49.918
I sat in this hole
for thousands of years,

25:50.088 --> 25:52.113
thinking of nothing
but redemption,

25:52.323 --> 25:55.121
of reclaiming my good name.

25:55.326 --> 25:59.285
I thought of nobody, no cause,
other than my own.

25:59.531 --> 26:00.811
You've been redeemed, my friend.

26:00.899 --> 26:04.596
The only thing that matters
in the end is the mission,

26:04.803 --> 26:08.967
protecting those who would not
and cannot protect themselves:

26:09.174 --> 26:11.039
The humans.

26:11.276 --> 26:13.608
None of us is bigger than that.

26:13.812 --> 26:17.805
And we will not let our fears,
our self-absorption

26:18.016 --> 26:20.883
prevent us from seeing it through.

26:21.086 --> 26:24.783
- Not anymore.
- No. Of course not.

26:26.758 --> 26:28.589
Move to the other side
of your cell, Castiel,

26:28.760 --> 26:30.640
- and keep your head down.
- What are you doing?

26:30.662 --> 26:32.630
When they say my name,
perhaps I won't just be

26:32.731 --> 26:34.062
- the one who let the serpent in.
- Don't!

26:34.299 --> 26:36.631
Perhaps I will be known
as one of the many...

26:36.835 --> 26:38.995
Gadreel.
...who gave Heaven a second chance.

26:40.672 --> 26:42.970
- Run, sister.
- Gadreel.

27:06.898 --> 27:09.560
Do you believe him now?

27:11.503 --> 27:13.664
You can save
the humble-pie Jesus routine

27:13.872 --> 27:15.772
for somebody who gives a damn.

27:19.511 --> 27:22.412
The problem with you, Dean,
is the cynicism.

27:22.614 --> 27:26.380
Always with the cynicism.

27:26.551 --> 27:27.848
But most people,

27:28.052 --> 27:32.682
even the real belly-crawlers
living in filth,

27:32.891 --> 27:34.483
or Brentwood...

27:36.261 --> 27:37.888
...they don't want to be cynical.

27:38.096 --> 27:41.156
They just want something
to believe in.

27:41.366 --> 27:44.961
- And that'd be you.
- Why not me?

27:45.170 --> 27:48.401
You've been working those people
outside for, what, a day?

27:48.573 --> 27:51.406
They've already spilled blood
in your name.

27:51.643 --> 27:54.669
You are nothing
but Bernie Madoff with wings.

27:57.015 --> 27:58.346
So I'm a fake.

28:01.286 --> 28:05.780
Do you have any idea
how much Pan-Cake makeup

28:05.957 --> 28:10.417
and soft lighting it took
to get God to work a rope line?

28:12.230 --> 28:14.824
He hated it.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.426
And, you know,
humans sense that.

28:19.604 --> 28:23.540
So they prayed harder and longer

28:23.775 --> 28:26.744
and fought more wars in his name.

28:26.945 --> 28:30.711
And for what?
So they could die of malaria?

28:30.882 --> 28:32.645
Leukemia?

28:32.851 --> 28:35.376
And all the while,
blaming themselves!

28:35.587 --> 28:40.183
"Oh, if only I'd been more prayerful,
God would have loved me!

28:40.425 --> 28:43.189
God would have saved me!"
You know what?

28:43.428 --> 28:46.454
God didn't even know their name!

28:46.631 --> 28:48.724
But I do.

28:50.068 --> 28:52.127
Because I've walked among them.

28:53.338 --> 28:57.035
- And I can save them.
- Sure, you can.

28:57.408 --> 28:59.876
So long as your mug
is in every Bible

29:00.078 --> 29:02.478
and "What would Metatron do?"
Is on every bumper.

29:03.514 --> 29:04.674
And?

29:04.816 --> 29:08.411
What, are you blaming me
for giving them what they want,

29:08.620 --> 29:10.180
giving them a brand
they can believe in?

29:10.255 --> 29:12.246
I'm blaming you for Kevin!

29:12.457 --> 29:15.858
I'm blaming you
for taking Cass' grace.

29:16.027 --> 29:18.507
Hell, I'm blaming you for the Cubs
not winning the World Series

29:18.730 --> 29:20.595
for the last 100 freaking years.

29:26.304 --> 29:28.067
Whatever it is...

29:29.207 --> 29:30.538
I'm blaming you.

29:30.742 --> 29:33.074
The First Blade.

29:34.112 --> 29:36.637
Nasty piece of work, isn't she?

29:37.548 --> 29:42.076
Okay, let's say you win, Dean...

29:42.887 --> 29:44.616
...and I die.

29:44.956 --> 29:46.981
What's the world left with then?

29:47.191 --> 29:52.356
A herd of panty-waisted angels
and you?

29:52.563 --> 29:55.828
Half out of your mind
with Lord knows what

29:56.034 --> 29:57.154
pumping through those veins?

29:57.235 --> 30:01.535
You see, the only thing you've said
that went into my ear

30:01.773 --> 30:06.801
- was that you die.
- Oh, fine. We'll fight.

30:07.879 --> 30:11.474
I don't know what you expect
is gonna come of all this.

30:12.951 --> 30:15.010
Unless...

30:16.054 --> 30:18.284
...that's why you're stalling.

30:18.489 --> 30:22.016
Because you know
nothing's gonna come of this

30:22.226 --> 30:25.821
unless your pals succeed upstairs.

30:25.997 --> 30:28.488
Well, here's a news flash.

30:28.700 --> 30:32.227
Humpty and Dumpty are starring
in their very own version

30:32.437 --> 30:35.235
Heaven
right now.

30:48.820 --> 30:53.689
Wow, that big blade and that...
douchy tribal tat

30:53.925 --> 30:56.723
sure gave you some superjuice.

30:56.928 --> 30:59.522
Woo!

30:59.731 --> 31:01.062
Okay.

31:08.940 --> 31:10.100
Where is it?

31:12.110 --> 31:13.110
Remove her.

31:30.595 --> 31:32.995
So, you took Abaddon's scalp,

31:33.164 --> 31:36.463
then you figured you'd take on
little, old, nebbishy me.

31:36.667 --> 31:37.998
What could go wrong?

31:38.803 --> 31:41.294
And you're powered
by the bone of a jackass,

31:41.506 --> 31:44.100
and it is just awesome, right?

31:45.710 --> 31:47.473
Here's a tip.

31:47.678 --> 31:51.409
Next time, try to be powered
by the word of God.

32:07.632 --> 32:09.691
Stay back.

32:09.834 --> 32:10.926
Stay back!

32:11.102 --> 32:12.330
Where's Metatron?

33:05.256 --> 33:06.450
No!

33:36.053 --> 33:38.112
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

33:48.733 --> 33:51.167
Well played, Castiel.

33:52.103 --> 33:55.698
Obviously, you and Gadreel managed
to turn a few dead enders against me.

33:55.907 --> 33:56.907
Gadreel is dead.

33:57.808 --> 33:58.866
Ah.

34:00.111 --> 34:02.671
So Gadreel bites the dust.

34:02.847 --> 34:05.338
And the Angel Tablet,

34:05.550 --> 34:08.542
arguably the most powerful instrument
in the history of the universe,

34:08.753 --> 34:11.779
is in pieces, and for what again?

34:11.956 --> 34:15.983
Oh, that's right,
to save Dean Winchester.

34:17.094 --> 34:18.822
That was your goal, right?

34:19.030 --> 34:21.998
I mean, you draped yourself
in the flag of Heaven,

34:22.199 --> 34:26.637
but, ultimately, it was all
about saving one human, right?

34:28.839 --> 34:30.568
Well, guess what?

34:31.309 --> 34:32.900
He's dead, too.

34:34.946 --> 34:36.846
And you're sitting in my chair.

34:40.418 --> 34:44.114
Sammy, you got to get out
of here before he comes back.

34:44.255 --> 34:47.018
Shh... Shut up. Shut up.
Just save your energy, all right?

34:47.225 --> 34:49.065
We'll stop the bleeding.
We'll get you a doctor

34:49.126 --> 34:50.646
or, find a spell.
You're gonna be okay.

34:51.429 --> 34:53.192
Listen to me.

34:53.431 --> 34:55.763
- It's better this way.
- What?

34:56.967 --> 34:58.401
The Mark.

34:58.603 --> 35:00.662
It's making me into something
I don't want to be.

35:00.871 --> 35:03.231
Don't worry about the Mark.
We'll figure out the Mark later.

35:03.241 --> 35:05.766
Just hold on, okay?
Give me some help.

35:06.244 --> 35:09.475
- You will never get away with this.
- Get away with what?

35:09.647 --> 35:12.775
You told a silly story to a group
of less-than-believers.

35:12.984 --> 35:14.417
I'll clean up your mess
in an hour.

35:14.619 --> 35:17.747
You give our brothers and sisters
far too little credit.

35:17.922 --> 35:20.584
They will soon learn that you
have been playing them.

35:22.393 --> 35:24.657
And then?

35:25.196 --> 35:30.133
They will do nothing because
they are frightened little sheep

35:30.301 --> 35:32.633
following my crook wherever it leads.

35:32.837 --> 35:34.964
And where I'm taking them,

35:35.172 --> 35:38.232
back to our rightful place
atop this mountain

35:38.476 --> 35:40.967
of human shame and excrement,

35:41.212 --> 35:43.077
when that happens, trust me,

35:43.281 --> 35:44.921
they're not gonna care
how they got there.

35:45.116 --> 35:47.346
What happened with you
being okay with this?

35:47.585 --> 35:50.611
- I lied.
- Ain't that a bitch?

35:50.821 --> 35:54.188
You know why you could never
quite pull it together, Castiel,

35:54.392 --> 35:59.022
while you're sitting here
with your grace slowly burning away

35:59.230 --> 36:01.664
and your reputation
long extinguished?

36:01.866 --> 36:03.925
No curiosity.

36:04.835 --> 36:06.530
You didn't read enough.

36:08.239 --> 36:12.175
You never learned
how to tell a good story.

36:14.879 --> 36:16.176
But you did.

36:29.593 --> 36:32.391
Sam. Hold up. Hold up.

36:39.003 --> 36:40.971
I got to say something to you.

36:41.172 --> 36:43.197
What?

36:45.810 --> 36:47.675
I'm proud of us.

36:53.751 --> 36:57.949
No, no. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, wake up, buddy.

36:58.189 --> 37:00.885
Hey. Dean.

37:02.360 --> 37:03.360
Dean!

37:25.850 --> 37:29.877
You're doing the right thing...
letting him live.

37:30.755 --> 37:33.485
- It's what a leader would do.
- I'm no leader, Hannah.

37:34.692 --> 37:36.489
I never was.

37:37.795 --> 37:39.990
I just want to be an angel.

37:42.400 --> 37:46.996
And your grace?
What will you do about that?

37:47.238 --> 37:49.934
You will die
if you don't replenish it.

38:38.923 --> 38:41.187
Damn it, Crowley.

38:42.827 --> 38:45.193
You got him into this mess.

38:45.930 --> 38:48.990
You will get him out...

38:49.200 --> 38:51.327
or so help me, God.

39:14.225 --> 39:17.217
Your brother, bless his soul...

39:18.696 --> 39:21.221
...is summoning me as I speak.

39:21.432 --> 39:24.026
Make a deal, bring you back.

39:24.235 --> 39:27.762
It's exactly what I was
talking about, isn't it?

39:27.972 --> 39:32.773
It's all become so... expected.

39:35.880 --> 39:37.939
You have to believe me.

39:38.148 --> 39:40.742
When I suggested you take
on the Mark of Cain,

39:40.918 --> 39:43.512
I didn't know
this was going to happen.

39:44.889 --> 39:46.481
Not really.

39:46.857 --> 39:51.954
I mean, I might not have
told you the entire truth.

39:53.397 --> 39:56.025
But I never lied.

39:56.200 --> 39:58.327
I never lied, Dean.

39:59.103 --> 40:00.798
That's important.

40:01.572 --> 40:03.437
It's fundamental.

40:06.010 --> 40:10.606
But, there is one story
about Cain

40:10.814 --> 40:14.875
that I might have...
forgotten to tell you.

40:16.287 --> 40:20.417
Apparently, he, too,
was willing to accept death,

40:20.591 --> 40:25.358
rather than becoming the killer
the Mark wanted him to be.

40:26.830 --> 40:29.663
So he took his own life
with the Blade.

40:30.768 --> 40:32.258
He died.

40:34.204 --> 40:37.173
Except, as rumor has it,

40:37.341 --> 40:40.742
the Mark never quite let go.

40:44.048 --> 40:48.109
You can understand
why I never spoke of this.

40:48.319 --> 40:53.018
Why set hearts aflutter
at mere speculation?

40:55.726 --> 40:58.559
It wasn't until you summoned me...

40:58.796 --> 41:05.224
No, it wasn't truly until you left
that cheeseburger uneaten...

41:10.074 --> 41:16.138
...that I began
to let myself believe.

41:16.347 --> 41:19.612
Maybe miracles do come true.

41:20.985 --> 41:22.714
Listen to me, Dean Winchester,

41:22.920 --> 41:25.684
what you're feeling right now,
it's not death.

41:25.923 --> 41:29.689
It's life, a new kind of life.

41:31.028 --> 41:32.586
Open your eyes, Dean.

41:32.830 --> 41:34.695
See what I see.

41:34.932 --> 41:36.866
Feel what I feel.

41:39.169 --> 41:41.603
And let's go take a howl
at that moon.
