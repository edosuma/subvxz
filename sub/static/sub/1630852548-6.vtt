40:28.960 --> 40:32.497
And I don't like
that I felt like I had, like,

40:32.563 --> 40:35.366
this pressure to wait,
and I think that's kind of

40:35.433 --> 40:36.668
where I came
to the realization that, like,

40:36.734 --> 40:38.002
I don't need to wait
until marriage

40:38.069 --> 40:39.938
but, like, I am gonna wait

40:40.004 --> 40:42.974
until, like, the first time
that I am in love.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.776

40:44.842 --> 40:46.711
I mean, yeah, honestly, like...

40:48.513 --> 40:51.616
Well, I mean, for one, I don't
know, like--for what it is,

40:51.683 --> 40:54.052

I would have never known.

40:54.118 --> 40:55.653

there's an attraction.

40:55.720 --> 40:56.654
- Yeah.

40:56.721 --> 40:57.989
- For me, more so
that's just like,

40:58.056 --> 40:59.557
that thought's like,
"Okay, do I see it?"

40:59.624 --> 41:00.992
Yes, I see
the physical attraction,

41:01.059 --> 41:03.027

that's all there, that's great.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.729

that, like again,

41:04.796 --> 41:06.831

that we have emotionally.

41:06.898 --> 41:08.333

of mentioned--said like,

41:08.399 --> 41:09.968
you're not necessarily
waiting till marriage,

41:10.001 --> 41:12.103
but you're waiting
until you fall in love.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.505
Have you been in love
since that point?

41:14.572 --> 41:17.275
- No, I've never been in love.

41:17.342 --> 41:18.576
- No.

41:18.643 --> 41:22.213
- So yeah, so before when
I was in relationships,

41:22.280 --> 41:24.949
I wasn't, like,
allowing that side of me

41:25.016 --> 41:26.918
to happen because I didn't
want to get hurt.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.953
- Yeah,
I mean, that's the scary part

41:29.020 --> 41:30.688
about being fully vulnerable.

41:30.755 --> 41:33.024
- Yeah.
- And it's interesting to hear

41:33.091 --> 41:34.659
you say you've never
been in love before,

41:34.726 --> 41:37.228
plus it sounds like you've
put up a little bit of a guard.

41:37.295 --> 41:39.063
I just wanted
to make sure, like,

41:39.130 --> 41:40.331
you feel like
you're fully vulnerable.

41:40.398 --> 41:41.699
Because I hope
that's where we're at

41:41.766 --> 41:44.435
at this point in the journey.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.839
- I think, like, that's been,
like, the hard part in this.

41:47.905 --> 41:50.174
Anytime I felt
the want to, like,

41:50.241 --> 41:52.610
put my walls back up again,
I have been,

41:52.677 --> 41:55.580
like, really trying
to, like, put them back down.

41:55.646 --> 41:57.949
In this environment,
like, that is hard,

41:58.016 --> 42:00.118
because there is a chance
that, like, I could very well

42:00.184 --> 42:01.819
get heart broken
by the end of it.

42:01.886 --> 42:04.455

not staying open.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.958
- Yeah, absolutely.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.226

never been in love, like,

42:08.292 --> 42:09.560
what is being in love?

42:09.627 --> 42:10.828
Like, what does that look like?

42:10.895 --> 42:12.163
Because if you've never
been in love, then like,

42:12.230 --> 42:13.965
how do you know when
you get to that point?

42:15.166 --> 42:16.567
- Like, I think
there will be a feeling,

42:16.634 --> 42:18.169
but I think it's
also just, like, feeling safe

42:18.236 --> 42:19.704
with the person that I'm with.

42:19.771 --> 42:22.774
Feeling, like, protected by
them and that I can trust them.

42:22.840 --> 42:25.910

especially, like, this early--

42:25.977 --> 42:28.346
like, this much trust
with a man.

42:28.413 --> 42:33.051

And we have riblje glave,

will be a knight's creed.

51:15.205 --> 51:18.409
For this test of heart,
you will be kneeling

51:18.475 --> 51:21.111

looking at Clayton.

51:21.178 --> 51:24.815

51:30.087 --> 51:31.322
- Okay, Clayton.

51:31.388 --> 51:33.657
I came here with an open mind

51:33.724 --> 51:36.760
and trying my hardest
to have an open heart.

51:36.827 --> 51:39.964

has proven to be really hard.

51:40.030 --> 51:42.166

I have to push myself.

51:58.882 --> 52:00.384
<i>and who's just a little bland.</i>

52:00.451 --> 52:03.687

52:03.754 --> 52:04.989
<i>- They all need to step it up.</i>

52:05.055 --> 52:07.157

52:07.224 --> 52:11.629

many strange lands together.

52:11.695 --> 52:14.665
<i>- They are all</i>
<i>a little dull for me.</i>

52:14.732 --> 52:17.668

but I'm gonna bring it.

52:17.735 --> 52:20.971
And I'm gonna be victorious.

52:25.209 --> 52:27.044
I ate the food
and I drank the ale.

52:27.111 --> 52:29.346
If we go to battle,
I will impale.

52:29.413 --> 52:31.448
For a happy life,
you must pick the best wife.

52:31.515 --> 52:34.418
If you pick the right one,
your search will be done.

52:34.485 --> 52:36.553

to get down on one knee,
