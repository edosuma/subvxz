WEBVTT

00:05.798 --> 00:06.923
I'm seeing someone.

00:07.255 --> 00:08.214
Someone I met at work.

00:08.297 --> 00:10.172
-Is he your boss?
-No, he's right here.

00:10.255 --> 00:11.756
Ted, this is Pete.

00:11.964 --> 00:13.422
Did you tell him
about Seth Meyers?

00:13.506 --> 00:14.673
-Shit.
-He's so great.

00:14.756 --> 00:17.339
Yeah. Dreamy.
I'm talking about Seth Myers.

00:17.422 --> 00:19.089
You got--
You're doing late night?

00:20.005 --> 00:21.297
Okay, let's go meet
your parents.

00:21.381 --> 00:22.172
Who's this?

00:22.547 --> 00:24.172
Remember the weekend
that I worked in New Jersey?

00:24.255 --> 00:25.547
-She was there.
-Hey.

00:25.631 --> 00:27.297
-And what am I gonna--
-And you stayed
in the same condo?

00:27.381 --> 00:28.923
Can we talk about this later?

00:29.005 --> 00:30.172
(SOBBING)

00:30.255 --> 00:32.381
-Hello!
-Hi!

00:32.464 --> 00:34.964
-I wanna know what you think.
-Well, are you wearing a bra?

00:35.047 --> 00:36.339
-Is that your business?
-Mom.

00:36.422 --> 00:39.255
It's my business when you're
sitting next to me in church.

00:39.339 --> 00:40.506
We're outta here. We're going.

00:40.589 --> 00:42.422
I'm really sorry,
and I love you.

00:42.506 --> 00:43.464
I love you too.

00:50.923 --> 00:53.464
Woman (on TV):
The judges were
in total agreement

00:53.547 --> 00:56.547
as to who should be
our star baker.

00:56.631 --> 00:58.339
Kitty, I'm gonna get going.

00:58.422 --> 01:00.506
What? Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

01:00.589 --> 01:03.255
Remember?
Ali did stand-up
on Seth Meyers?

01:03.339 --> 01:05.673
Some comics are gonna
get together and watch.

01:05.756 --> 01:07.214
Oh, no,
I'm so sleepy.

01:07.297 --> 01:09.422
I don't think
I can go out tonight.

01:09.506 --> 01:11.172
-(mumbles): Sorry.
-That's okay.

01:11.255 --> 01:12.673
It's-- It's
just kinda...

01:12.756 --> 01:15.464
It's like a comic thing.
Just a me thing.

01:15.547 --> 01:17.130
Oh, I'm not invited?

01:17.214 --> 01:18.547
No, of course
you're invited.

01:18.631 --> 01:21.297
-You're invited.
-It sounds like
I'm not invited.

01:21.381 --> 01:24.339
No, I-- Kitty,
I barely want to go.

01:24.422 --> 01:27.172
I just felt weird,
you know, not saying yes.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.714
-Okay.
-I hope it's not--

01:29.798 --> 01:33.381
You don't still feel
weird about Ali and me
and the road or...

01:33.464 --> 01:35.381
No, Pete.
I don't hate Ali.

01:35.464 --> 01:37.881
I just-- If you're
gonna hang out
with your ex-girlfriend,

01:37.964 --> 01:39.756
I would like
to know about it

01:39.839 --> 01:41.798
in advance,
because that was weird.

01:41.881 --> 01:43.506
If it-- Yeah.

01:45.005 --> 01:48.339
-I don't have to go.
-Kitty: No, it sounds
like you should go.

01:48.422 --> 01:51.089
It sounds
like you wanna go
and it'll be fun.

01:51.172 --> 01:52.506
Okay.

01:54.255 --> 01:56.089
-Do you want to come?
-Do you want me to come?

01:56.172 --> 01:58.297
I want you to come with me
if you want to come with me.

01:58.381 --> 02:01.089
Do you-- If--
Just, do you want to?

02:01.172 --> 02:04.756
Well, I don't want
to come if you don't,
like, want me to come.

02:04.839 --> 02:06.547
You're invited, yes.

02:06.631 --> 02:08.881
I want you to go
if you want to go.

02:08.964 --> 02:10.464
Is it gonna be fun?

02:10.547 --> 02:13.506
Yes. Yeah!
I think so.

02:13.589 --> 02:16.047
Just a bunch of comedians
in a comedy club

02:16.130 --> 02:19.631
talking about comedy,
that's fun.

02:19.714 --> 02:21.381
What's more fun
than that?

02:22.422 --> 02:24.506
-Okay, I'll come.
-Great!

02:24.589 --> 02:27.756
-Let me just change.
-Okay.

02:27.839 --> 02:30.464
♪ I'm wopping
I'm feeling myself, uh  ♪

02:30.547 --> 02:33.130
♪ Jazz all in my soul
I'm killing, uh  ♪

02:33.214 --> 02:35.297
Maybe this is
a mistake.

02:35.381 --> 02:36.798
-What?
-What?

02:36.881 --> 02:38.964
This whole party thing
just feels really excessive.

02:39.047 --> 02:40.964
-No.
-Right? To, like,
do it at The Cellar?

02:41.047 --> 02:42.547
We could just watch it
at my apartment.

02:42.631 --> 02:45.130
Stop it. You need
to start to learn how
to celebrate yourself.

02:45.214 --> 02:47.214
You know, part of being
an empowered woman

02:47.297 --> 02:50.464
is unapologetically
showing the world
how much you matter.

02:50.547 --> 02:53.422
-Anaya: Thank you!
-Oh, then I wore that dress!

02:53.506 --> 02:55.464
I never wear dresses
to do stand-up,

02:55.547 --> 02:58.673
and then I suddenly
decided that was the move
for national television.

02:58.756 --> 03:00.255
Oh, that's
what you do!

03:00.339 --> 03:03.214
Don't you want to look great
when you're on a date
with destiny?

03:04.714 --> 03:06.339
That's why you'd wear a dress.

03:06.422 --> 03:08.839
How did you know
this was happening?

03:08.923 --> 03:10.839
I got my sources.

03:10.923 --> 03:12.214
Pete told you?

03:12.297 --> 03:13.839
Yeah, he's a satisfied
client of mine.

03:13.923 --> 03:15.839
Listen, Ali, everyone
is here to support you.

03:15.923 --> 03:18.422
-Come on,
this is a big night!
-This is your night!

03:18.506 --> 03:20.589
It's not that big of a deal,
guys, really.

03:20.673 --> 03:22.005
Well, you know,
it could be.

03:22.089 --> 03:24.381
With the right help,
with the right support system,

03:24.464 --> 03:26.464
you could take this
and turn it into something big.

03:26.547 --> 03:28.464
You're gonna need somebody
on your team, okay?

03:28.547 --> 03:30.172
You can't represent yourself.

03:30.255 --> 03:32.297
What if Whitney Houston sang
"The Star-Spangled Banner"

03:32.381 --> 03:33.839
and nobody told
anybody about it?

03:33.923 --> 03:36.047
What if Prince did
the halftime show
at the Super Bowl

03:36.130 --> 03:38.381
and nobody ever saw it?
Where would we be now?

03:38.464 --> 03:40.756
I don't really think
managers do as much

03:40.839 --> 03:43.214
-as you think
managers do.
-But they could.

03:43.297 --> 03:45.172
I could introduce you
to Scott Disick.

03:45.255 --> 03:46.673
I just met him
at a rave.

03:46.756 --> 03:47.964
-All right.
-(crowd laughing)

03:48.047 --> 03:50.381
I had a heart attack
in February, and, um,

03:50.464 --> 03:53.005
I don't even like the fact
that I have to tell people
I had a heart attack.

03:53.089 --> 03:55.047
Like, I wish, you know,
I'm supposed to be famous,

03:55.130 --> 03:58.547
you know, but it's, like,
I'm famous but nobody knows.

03:58.631 --> 04:01.714
Like, I'm famous
but nobody cares.
That's been my problem.

04:01.798 --> 04:03.631
I'm famous, but I've been famous
too many times back

04:03.714 --> 04:06.047
and then unfamous
and then famous again.

04:06.130 --> 04:08.964
And after a while, people are
just over it, unfortunately.

04:09.047 --> 04:11.005
Like, in this neighborhood--
true story--

04:11.089 --> 04:13.214
these guys were bringing
a couch up a stoop, like,

04:13.297 --> 04:15.381
and they recognized me,
knew my name, 'cause I'm famous.

04:15.464 --> 04:18.255
Guy goes, "Colin Quinn--"
he starts dropping his--

04:18.339 --> 04:21.589
-"Grab the other end
for a second."
-(audience laughing)

04:21.673 --> 04:23.422
That's not how you speak
to famous people, folks.

04:23.506 --> 04:25.714
You understand?
You're supposed to be
a little reverent.

04:25.798 --> 04:29.089
Nobody's ever like,
"Hey, Rihanna, you got
jumper cables?"

04:29.172 --> 04:30.798
(audience laughing)

04:32.547 --> 04:34.547
-Is that her?
-Yeah.

04:34.631 --> 04:37.589
-She's not mousy!
-Shh, don't say that.

04:37.673 --> 04:40.214
-Hi, Ali! Hi!
-Oh my God.
Hey, hi!

04:40.297 --> 04:42.756
-So nice to finally meet you.
-So nice to meet you!

04:42.839 --> 04:44.255
-It's Kat?
-Yes!

04:44.339 --> 04:46.631
-Yes, hi. I was worried
I was hugging a stranger.
-Hi!

04:46.714 --> 04:49.339
-No, this is Kat. Hi, hi.
-Hi, hi. You are Pete.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.255
-Still Pete, yes.
-Yes. Pete in a hat.

04:51.339 --> 04:52.881
-How did it go?
-It was good.

04:52.964 --> 04:55.089
-Good? Great?
-Yeah, it was-- Yeah,
I think it was great.

04:55.172 --> 04:58.589
I mean, I don't know.
it was either good or bad,
we'll see when it airs.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.589
No, you're
a stand-up comedian!

05:00.673 --> 05:03.130
-Like, that is so crazy!
That is so cool!
-Yeah.

05:03.214 --> 05:04.923
-Congrats!
-It is crazy.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.297
You had a dream
and it came true.

05:07.381 --> 05:10.631
-Oh, well, yeah.
Guess that's--
-How amazing is that?

05:10.714 --> 05:12.631
-That's crazy.
-Kitty: Yeah.

05:12.714 --> 05:15.339
-Um, you guys are tall!
-(laughing)

05:15.422 --> 05:18.047
-I'm like craning
my neck to look at you.
-Yeah.

05:18.130 --> 05:20.506
You're both very
tall and blonde,

05:20.589 --> 05:23.798
-and the half-Jewish
part of me is scared.
-(laughing)

05:23.881 --> 05:26.631
-Don't hurt me.
(laughing)
-Kat: Ah!

05:26.714 --> 05:30.047
-We're very open-minded.
-(laughing): Yeah.

05:30.130 --> 05:33.881
Yeah, well, we don't
want to bother you.

05:33.964 --> 05:35.839
What? Oh, hi, hi.

05:35.923 --> 05:39.214
-Ted: I got you a drink.
-Ali: Oh, thank you. Thanks!

05:39.297 --> 05:41.089
-Pete.
-Pete: Ted.

05:41.172 --> 05:43.381
-It's Ted.
-Wait, you're so tall.

05:43.464 --> 05:45.172
You were giving us
shit about being tall,

05:45.255 --> 05:46.839
-but he's so tall.
-Ali: He is.

05:46.923 --> 05:48.839
-What the fuck?
-She's, uh, three talls.

05:48.923 --> 05:51.172
Oh, my God.
I'm surrounded.

05:51.255 --> 05:52.589
That's so cute.

05:52.673 --> 05:55.089
I want to say hi to Estee
in case she leaves.

05:55.172 --> 05:57.047
-Okay, cool.
-So I'll be right back.

05:57.130 --> 05:58.756
-Cool.
-I'm just gonna get
this out of the way.

05:58.839 --> 06:00.589
-Yeah, yeah.
-We'll just hang out.

06:00.673 --> 06:02.798
-Okay, fine.
-Compare notes.

06:02.881 --> 06:05.089
Ninety percent of people
that kill really hard,

06:05.172 --> 06:06.714
there's something
hacky going on.

06:06.798 --> 06:10.506
-Joyelle: Interesting.
-(indistinct chattering)

06:10.589 --> 06:12.964
Wil:
If you're killing for an hour,
you're hacking?

06:13.047 --> 06:14.297
-If you're getting...
-No.

06:14.381 --> 06:16.756
...every moron
in the crowd cackling,

06:16.839 --> 06:18.297
falling over their set
for an hour,

06:18.381 --> 06:20.506
I guarantee there's a lot
of hack stuff going on in there.

06:20.589 --> 06:23.214
-I disagree.
-Estee, damn it!

06:23.297 --> 06:25.589
-(laughing)
-Joyelle: Hey!

06:25.673 --> 06:28.381
Then all you
need just to play
the devil's advocate.

06:28.464 --> 06:30.464
Sorry. Hi, Estee.
I'm Pete.

06:30.547 --> 06:34.839
-Hi. I know who you are.
-Oh. Um...

06:34.923 --> 06:37.381
I just wanted to say hi
to everybody. Wayne.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.547
-Good to see you, brother.
-Good to see you.

06:39.631 --> 06:40.881
Dildo dude
with the dumb hat.

06:40.964 --> 06:42.756
-Dildo dude
with the dumb hat.
-Joyelle: Yes!

06:42.839 --> 06:45.714
-That's my website dot net.
Dot com was taken.
-Take that off.

06:45.798 --> 06:47.255
Wayne:
This is Colin Quinn,
by the way.

06:47.339 --> 06:49.589
-Hey! Really nice
to meet you.
-Hey.

06:49.673 --> 06:51.839
Um, some of us,
I don't know if you noticed,

06:51.923 --> 06:55.506
we're getting together
to have a screening party
for my friend Ali.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.005
She's doing
Seth Meyers  tonight.

06:57.089 --> 06:59.464
-Do you know Ali?
She's wonderful.
-No.

06:59.547 --> 07:02.047
She's beautiful, she's funny,
she's charismatic.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.756
-She's going places.
-She's great, she's great.

07:04.839 --> 07:06.506
Well, I'll be
at the bar.

07:07.798 --> 07:09.756
That guy's got
little dick energy.

07:09.839 --> 07:11.506
-(audience laughing)
-I know the struggle.

07:11.589 --> 07:13.839
Because when my dad
first came to America,

07:13.923 --> 07:16.172
he used to think the solution
from getting deported,

07:16.255 --> 07:18.381
just pretend
you're not Haitian.

07:18.464 --> 07:21.089
That was his solution
if immigration ever
come up to you.

07:21.172 --> 07:22.798
"You Haitian?"
(Haitian accent):
"No, you crazy.

07:22.881 --> 07:25.589
-I'm not Haitian."
-(audience chuckling)

07:25.673 --> 07:27.297
"Uh-oh.

07:27.381 --> 07:31.589
"I've been in America
five years all my life.

07:31.673 --> 07:35.339
Why you-- Why you say that?
Who-- Who tell you that?"

07:40.297 --> 07:42.923
I'm really proud of you
for tonight.

07:43.005 --> 07:44.422
Thanks, Dad.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.089
(laughs)
I mean it.

07:46.172 --> 07:49.673
Nobody works as hard as you.
It's nice to see it pay off.

07:49.756 --> 07:51.964
It's inspiring.
I'm happy to see that,

07:52.047 --> 07:53.839
you know,
the good guys win.

07:53.923 --> 07:55.964
Can you do me a favor?

07:56.047 --> 07:59.464
If the set sucks,
will you just tell me, please?

07:59.547 --> 08:02.297
Because, well, Ted's just
gonna tell me it's great

08:02.381 --> 08:03.881
no matter what
because he loves me.

08:03.964 --> 08:06.172
Yeah, it's not gonna suck.
It's gonna be--

08:06.255 --> 08:09.798
I mean it. I could go
up on stage and vomit
and do a curtsey,

08:09.881 --> 08:11.923
and Ted would be like,
"Awesome closer, babe!"

08:12.005 --> 08:14.464
Except, he doesn't
call it the closer.

08:14.547 --> 08:15.964
He calls it the finale.

08:16.047 --> 08:18.673
-Like a fireworks display?
-Yeah.

08:18.756 --> 08:21.130
I'm gonna start
using that.

08:21.214 --> 08:24.631
(chattering, laughing)

08:24.714 --> 08:28.464
Can you--
Will you excuse me
for just one second?

08:28.547 --> 08:32.589
-Oh. Yeah.
-Sort of worlds colliding.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.756
Okay.

08:34.839 --> 08:36.506
I went shopping
for a dress,

08:36.589 --> 08:39.339
and so he like came
into the dressing room
with me.

08:39.422 --> 08:42.047
-Whoa, it's like
two naked Big Birds.
-(laughing)

08:42.130 --> 08:44.798
-That's exactly
what it looks like!
-Mike: What?

08:44.881 --> 08:47.881
-Hi.
-(hollering, laughing)

08:47.964 --> 08:50.255
-Hello!
-What's going on?

08:50.339 --> 08:52.005
I'm just telling them
about how we met.

08:52.089 --> 08:54.172
-Not all the details?
-Mike: Not yet!

08:54.255 --> 08:56.547
Russell:
Not all of them, but some
important ones were told.

08:56.631 --> 08:57.756
-Yes.
-Pete: Uh-huh.

08:57.839 --> 08:59.047
Russell:
And it was
just getting good.

08:59.130 --> 09:02.005
In fact, um,
was it good for you?

09:02.089 --> 09:03.964
-Ah!
-(laughing)

09:04.047 --> 09:06.172
I just want to know.

09:06.255 --> 09:08.547
Um, tonight, not about that.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.381
(chuckles)
It's about Ali, so...

09:10.464 --> 09:12.506
Pete, don't be embarrassed.
You're sexy.

09:12.589 --> 09:15.214
-Russell: You...
You are sexy, Pete.
-You are sexy.

09:15.297 --> 09:17.422
Russell:
Like, own it, man.
Own that sexiness.

09:17.506 --> 09:20.047
-Yeah, you got that swerve.
-Russell: Yeah, man.

09:20.130 --> 09:21.589
This is great.

09:21.673 --> 09:23.506
-(all laughing)
-Not that good, Pete.

09:23.589 --> 09:25.255
Pete:
Seriously though?
Seriously,

09:25.339 --> 09:27.381
I was gonna get a drink,
and it looks like

09:27.464 --> 09:30.255
maybe you'd like
a sparkling water?

09:30.339 --> 09:32.547
-Do you want a--
-No, can you get me
another one?

09:32.631 --> 09:34.089
Why don't you
come with me?

09:34.172 --> 09:36.923
-No!
-She's staying.

09:37.005 --> 09:39.339
-But I want
to hang out with them.
-I wanna have fun with you.

09:39.422 --> 09:41.255
Let's-- Come on,
we'll get a drink together.

09:41.339 --> 09:43.547
Petey, just let me--
I'm gonna stay here, okay?

09:43.631 --> 09:45.422
-She's staying.
-Yeah, you always get her.

09:45.506 --> 09:47.589
-I'm...
-Take your time, man.
Let her stay here.

09:47.673 --> 09:49.297
Others:
Oh, yeah!

09:49.381 --> 09:52.089
-Thank you. I love you.
-Thanks for drinks.

09:52.172 --> 09:54.297
I had sex
at a job fair.

09:54.381 --> 09:56.047
All:
Whoa!

09:56.130 --> 09:58.547
-At which table?
-In the bathroom.

09:58.631 --> 10:01.547
In the bathroom?
What, like a union man?

10:01.631 --> 10:03.255
Not a union man.

10:03.339 --> 10:06.047
He was handing out
pamphlets for the Walmart.

10:06.130 --> 10:07.756
(laughing)

10:07.839 --> 10:10.673
-Hi, can I get
a shot please?
-Peter!

10:11.506 --> 10:12.798
-Hi.
-What?

10:12.881 --> 10:14.798
What are you
doing here?

10:14.881 --> 10:16.089
Ali invited us.

10:16.172 --> 10:18.339
Her and Jess are like
super pals since the roast.

10:18.422 --> 10:20.881
-Jess is here?
-Yeah.

10:20.964 --> 10:23.047
God, that's
fucking weird, man.

10:23.130 --> 10:24.756
What is weird?

10:24.839 --> 10:26.923
My ex-girlfriend,
my current girlfriend,

10:27.005 --> 10:29.089
and now my ex-wife
are all in the same place,

10:29.172 --> 10:30.964
that's weird.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.130
Cut the negativity, man.
That's awesome!

10:34.214 --> 10:37.964
You're talking about three women
that you've shared love with.

10:38.047 --> 10:41.130
That's a beautiful thing.
How are you whining about that?

10:41.214 --> 10:44.673
Don't make this about you.
It's about Ali.

10:44.756 --> 10:47.798
And one day, you'll
be up there performing
on Star Search,

10:47.881 --> 10:51.089
and you'll get three
and three-quarter stars,
and you'll win,

10:51.172 --> 10:53.339
and Sinbad will be
the one frowning that day.

10:53.422 --> 10:58.255
And we'll all be
here on your side,
laughing for you.

10:58.339 --> 11:01.214
You got rid of your TV
a long time ago, huh?

11:01.297 --> 11:04.964
No, I just moved to a place
without any electricity.

11:05.047 --> 11:07.631
(patrons clap, cheer)

11:07.714 --> 11:09.172
What's all this, Wil?

11:09.255 --> 11:11.297
Oh, Ali Reissen
doing Seth Meyers.

11:11.381 --> 11:12.297
Ali who?

11:12.381 --> 11:14.214
Ali-- Ali Reissen.

11:14.297 --> 11:15.839
I've never seen her
my entire life.

11:15.923 --> 11:17.964
She's doing
Seth fucking Meyers,

11:18.047 --> 11:19.798
and it's like-- it's like
an open mic now?

11:19.881 --> 11:21.714
-What's the matter?
She's funny.
-I mean, they just

11:21.798 --> 11:23.339
-take anybody now.
-It's not my fault you--

11:23.422 --> 11:26.172
No, I didn't know.
I thought it was
gonna keep coming.

11:26.255 --> 11:28.923
And now with all
this diversity--
you're diverse,

11:29.005 --> 11:30.756
you can barely talk,
you know what I mean?

11:30.839 --> 11:33.214
You still got a fucking
accent and you've been
here like 50 years.

11:33.297 --> 11:35.839
I mean, come on.
I mean, seriously.
Are you playing it?

11:35.923 --> 11:39.130
Can you talk normal
and you're just doing it
to get a special?

11:39.214 --> 11:41.798
It's not my fault
you're using whiteness
in the wrong way.

11:41.881 --> 11:43.506
-That's not my fault.
-I know, I know, I know.

11:43.589 --> 11:45.089
I should've been
an agent or something.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.839
All this whiteness
and it got you nowhere.

11:46.923 --> 11:49.297
Look at this guy.
This guy will get a
fucking special before me.

11:49.381 --> 11:51.339
-Because he's black?
-No, 'cause he's diverse.

11:51.422 --> 11:53.339
Hey, you guys,
it's about to start!

11:53.422 --> 11:55.130
Um, hi?
Hi, excuse me.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.255
Do you mind just
putting on NBC, please?
Seth Meyers  is about to begin.

11:58.339 --> 12:00.005
Thanks.

12:00.089 --> 12:02.964
Announcer:
From 30 Rockefeller
Plaza in New York...

12:03.047 --> 12:05.881
You recorded this
this afternoon?
You taped this afternoon?

12:05.964 --> 12:07.381
-Today, yeah.
-And now it's airing.

12:07.464 --> 12:10.130
This is the best time
when you don't even know
how it is.

12:10.214 --> 12:12.214
-No idea.
-So exciting.
How do you feel?

12:12.297 --> 12:13.714
Kind of freaking out.

12:13.798 --> 12:15.923
Colin:
Sure, 'cause everything you do
lives forever.

12:16.005 --> 12:18.089
-That's the scary part
about doing TV.
-Wayne: Oh, God.

12:18.172 --> 12:20.756
-I did Crocodile Dundee 2  ,
you ever heard of it?
-Mm-mm.

12:20.839 --> 12:23.047
Well, anyway,
it was better than one,
a lot of people said.

12:23.130 --> 12:25.422
But it's, you know,
people troll you online.

12:25.506 --> 12:27.339
"Hey fatso. Hey stupid."

12:27.422 --> 12:28.839
-You know, forever.
-Oh, God.

12:28.923 --> 12:31.130
So he's in that.
I'm in Legally Blonde  .

12:31.214 --> 12:33.547
Little kids come up to me
and they're like, "I know you!

12:33.631 --> 12:36.047
You got Elle Woods
into Harvard."

12:36.130 --> 12:37.881
It's fantastic.
But other times, like,

12:37.964 --> 12:40.005
you Google my name,
guess what comes up?

12:40.089 --> 12:42.589
Not Legally Blonde  .
My evening at the Improv.

12:42.673 --> 12:44.047
-Huh.
-Didn't go well.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.923
I wore a pirate's jacket
on a half-hour comedy special.

12:47.005 --> 12:48.714
-Yeah.
-It wasn't
my best look, a mullet.

12:48.798 --> 12:50.798
People, to this day, act like
I was Harvey Weinstein.

12:50.881 --> 12:52.881
-Oh, God.
-It was a bad
fashion choice.

12:52.964 --> 12:54.631
-Yeah. Forever.
-Right, right. Yeah.

12:54.714 --> 12:56.422
Yeah, here's the crazy thing.
In the future,

12:56.506 --> 12:58.297
you're gonna realize
this is probably a terrible set,

12:58.381 --> 13:00.047
because you get better
as a comedian.

13:00.130 --> 13:02.089
And you're like,
"Oh, now I know
how to do those jokes.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.714
Now I know
how not to look panicked
on television.

13:04.798 --> 13:07.756
-(nervous laughter)
-Yeah, our point is,
congratulations.

13:07.839 --> 13:09.297
-You're in
the club now.
-Cool!

13:09.381 --> 13:11.130
You know how many people
want to do comedy?

13:11.214 --> 13:13.506
Colin:
And they don't ever
get on television?

13:13.589 --> 13:15.547
I'm just gonna...
I'll be right back.

13:15.631 --> 13:17.339
Okay.
It's exciting.

13:17.422 --> 13:20.047
-Yeah.
-Yeah. I would never
have a party, though.

13:20.130 --> 13:22.130
-No. No!
-God, could you imagine?

13:22.214 --> 13:26.589
(patrons chattering)

13:42.631 --> 13:44.798
What's up?
Are you freaking out?

13:44.881 --> 13:47.798
Yeah? What's-- Why?

13:47.881 --> 13:50.089
I feel like
I'm not gonna be great.

13:50.172 --> 13:51.798
-You're gonna be great.
-No, no, no. I mean,

13:51.881 --> 13:55.214
I'm afraid
that I am just good.

13:55.297 --> 13:58.089
And there are a lot
of people who are good,

13:58.172 --> 13:59.964
and I'm just gonna be
another good.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.297
Okay.

14:03.130 --> 14:04.881
-Do this.
-What?

14:04.964 --> 14:08.172
Do this with your body.
(inhales, exhaling)

14:08.255 --> 14:10.631
-Is this a Jesus thing?
-It's not a Jesus thing.

14:10.714 --> 14:12.130
It's a power stance.

14:12.214 --> 14:14.255
If you're feeling
small and nervous,

14:14.339 --> 14:16.214
this tricks your body
into feeling good.

14:16.297 --> 14:18.798
It works.
I do it before shows.

14:18.881 --> 14:20.881
(Pete inhaling, exhaling)

14:20.964 --> 14:22.172
Can you feel it?

14:22.255 --> 14:23.839
-I can feel it.
-Don't fucking
lie to me.

14:23.923 --> 14:25.297
-Can you feel it?
-I can feel it!

14:25.381 --> 14:27.005
-Woo!
-Woo!

14:27.089 --> 14:30.839
I get it.
I feel invincible.

14:30.923 --> 14:32.756
Can I get
another one?

14:34.839 --> 14:37.172
-You here
to see Ali?
-What?

14:37.255 --> 14:39.506
-For the viewing?
You here for that?
-Oh, yeah.

14:39.589 --> 14:41.964
That's cool.
Me, too.

14:45.089 --> 14:46.339
Wait, who are you?

14:46.422 --> 14:48.631
That's so funny,
'cause I was just
about to tell you

14:48.714 --> 14:50.214
-who I am.
-(Kat laughing)

14:50.297 --> 14:51.798
I'm Leif.

14:51.881 --> 14:53.839
Oh, you're Leif?

14:53.923 --> 14:55.089
Yeah.

14:55.172 --> 14:57.714
I'm Kat.
I'm Pete's girlfriend.

14:57.798 --> 14:59.005
Oh, right.

14:59.089 --> 15:00.589
Yeah, I know
all about you.

15:00.673 --> 15:03.047
You slept with Pete's wife
and you ruined his marriage.

15:03.130 --> 15:04.964
Okay, yeah.
Marriages die, Kat.

15:05.047 --> 15:07.923
But out of the ashes rose
the beautiful phoenix

15:08.005 --> 15:10.422
of a lovely friendship.

15:10.506 --> 15:13.214
Does anybody buy
your bullshit?

15:13.297 --> 15:15.047
I can't be
the judge of that.

15:15.130 --> 15:16.923
-Jess! Hi!
-Hey!

15:17.005 --> 15:18.547
This is Kat.

15:18.631 --> 15:21.047
Oh, it's so nice
to meet you.

15:21.130 --> 15:22.839
Oh, is it?

15:25.506 --> 15:27.422
I thought it was.

15:27.506 --> 15:31.255
She scared me so bad.

15:31.339 --> 15:34.547
-Oh. Oh.
-My bones are ice.

15:34.631 --> 15:37.547
-(audience laughing)
-Kids are rough,
'cause they--

15:37.631 --> 15:39.631
It's a lot of responsibility.
They don't have any money.

15:39.714 --> 15:41.839
I had to buy a bed.
You know where I went
to buy a bed?

15:41.923 --> 15:45.756
Bed, Bath, and Beyond.
They don't sell beds
at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.

15:45.839 --> 15:48.297
I was looking for a bed
for half an hour at
Bed, Bath, and Beyond,

15:48.381 --> 15:50.631
-just walking around
like a fucking idiot.
-(laughing)

15:50.714 --> 15:52.923
Finally I just asked the guy,
I go, "Where are the beds?"

15:53.005 --> 15:55.422
He goes, "We don't sell beds."
I'm like, "It's Bed, Bath,
and Beyond."

15:55.506 --> 15:57.589
He goes, "Yeah, we fucked up,
you know," so...

15:57.673 --> 15:59.047
(audience laughing)

15:59.130 --> 16:00.589
I'm like,
"Is there even a Beyond?"

16:00.673 --> 16:03.339
He goes, "No, but we got
a lot of chip clips."

16:04.506 --> 16:06.964
Next up, we have
Saoirse Ronan, and later,

16:07.047 --> 16:10.130
making her late-night
television debut,
comedian Ali Reissen!

16:10.214 --> 16:14.255
-(cheering, applauding)
-Stick around, everybody.
We'll be right back.

16:18.297 --> 16:20.631
Oh my God,
it's Emo Philips.

16:20.714 --> 16:22.089
Oh my God.

16:22.172 --> 16:24.547
-Nice to see you.
-Oh, good to see you.

16:24.631 --> 16:26.964
Does he even play here?

16:27.047 --> 16:28.631
I didn't even think
he lived in New York.

16:28.714 --> 16:31.714
He looks like he lives
in a tree. Who is that?

16:31.798 --> 16:34.422
Oh, he's the godfather
of alt comedy.

16:34.506 --> 16:38.089
-What are you doing in town?
-I just saw a Broadway show.

16:38.172 --> 16:41.714
-What'd you see?
-Well, they didn't
have a name,

16:41.798 --> 16:44.339
but I gave
them a dollar.

16:44.422 --> 16:45.798
Oh.

16:45.881 --> 16:49.130
His aura is both
childlike and wise
at the same time.

16:49.214 --> 16:51.839
He looks like he rode
here on an umbrella.

16:51.923 --> 16:55.673
-Hi, Emo. Oh, my goodness.
So nice to see you.
-(Emo gasping)

16:55.756 --> 16:57.297
You look so good.

16:57.381 --> 16:59.464
Oh, right back at ya,
hot mama.

16:59.547 --> 17:02.547
Oh, this is... It's cool
that he's here. It's cool.

17:02.631 --> 17:06.172
-Right? Come on.
-Oh, no. It's fine.
No, no, no.

17:06.255 --> 17:08.881
Tonight is all about you.
This is your night.

17:08.964 --> 17:10.464
Thank you.
It's totally fine.

17:10.547 --> 17:11.839
Do you think
he's gonna go up?

17:11.923 --> 17:13.422
Fuck, I hope so.

favorite comics.

-Yeah!

some real shit, man.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.005
-I'm not saying--
-What the fuck
is wrong with you?

17:21.089 --> 17:23.547
-Let's go see if
he's doing something.
-Actually, I would love that.

17:23.631 --> 17:25.089
-Come on, let's go.
-Come on, let's check it out.

-Emo: Oh, hello.
-Ali: All right.

17:29.798 --> 17:32.047

and watch for one minute?

17:32.130 --> 17:33.464
Wait. You're leaving?

17:33.547 --> 17:35.297
Oh, come on.
I just wanna watch,
like, eight jokes.

17:35.381 --> 17:36.881
And I'll be right back up.
Do you mind?

17:36.964 --> 17:38.255
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go, go, go.

17:38.339 --> 17:40.964

-I'll be right back.

to go should just go, um...

Ali, we're all here for you,
this is all about you.

17:47.297 --> 17:49.005
Yeah, we don't care
about Emu Philips.

17:49.089 --> 17:52.798
-Emo, see? Zero fucks.
We don't care.
-Okay, Emo. I don't--

17:53.756 --> 17:56.089
Okay, well, I'm--
I'm just gonna see

17:56.172 --> 17:57.964

the voice bit.

I'll fill my humidifier

18:30.047 --> 18:32.297

door for her. Ooh!

baseball season.

19:09.339 --> 19:12.798
I love baseball.
Once, when I was a little boy,

19:12.881 --> 19:17.464
I beat up the school bully
with a baseball bat.

19:17.547 --> 19:20.923
Both his arms were
completely broken,

I've seen that set.

20:00.589 --> 20:02.172

-YouTube, yeah.

20:02.255 --> 20:05.422
I had a four-and-a-half
minute set, and I'm
not exaggerating,

20:05.506 --> 20:09.839
I must have rehearsed it
in front of the mirror

preparation.

20:16.297 --> 20:21.214
Just remember--
Chaplin can be Keaton,

20:21.297 --> 20:24.798
but the Marx Brothers
cannot be the Stooges.

I have a gut, you know?"

-Yeah.

21:26.673 --> 21:28.714
The only time it would be
cool to have a food baby

21:28.798 --> 21:30.255
is if you got treated
the same way

21:30.339 --> 21:33.255
as someone pregnant
with a regular baby, right?

"Who's your daddy?"

"Where's your erection?"

total throw down.

benchwarmer quality,
you know?

-Yes.
-You know what's
fucking rude

is Ali telling a joke

-You should be
fucking humiliated.
-You don't know that.

You don't know it was
about me. How do you
know it was about me?

26:05.964 --> 26:09.214
-It was about your dick.
-I don't fucking lose
enough erections

26:09.297 --> 26:12.297
for that to definitely
be about me. You don't
know that.

26:13.297 --> 26:16.923

people they care about.

26:17.005 --> 26:19.547
-That's what we do.
-Oh, she cares about you.

go back to her.

-Can I explain something
to you right now?
-No, bye.

26:28.631 --> 26:31.673

and you're making
a drunken, crazy scene

26:31.756 --> 26:33.631

on a night that has
nothing to do with you!

26:33.714 --> 26:35.464

-I don't do any jokes--

26:44.464 --> 26:45.881
-Tell me what
jokes you tell.
-Jesus.

26:45.964 --> 26:47.756
-Tell me what jokes
you say about me.
-No!

26:47.839 --> 26:49.714
I'm not doing my act
for you in the road,

26:49.798 --> 26:51.839
-while you're making a scene.
-Oh, you're not gonna do
your shitty little act?

26:51.923 --> 26:53.589
Do it. You can't get
into The Cellar.

26:53.673 --> 26:56.631
Tell me a fucking joke
outside of The Cellar, Pete.

27:02.005 --> 27:04.047
My girlfriend loves dildos.

27:04.714 --> 27:06.172
Sometimes she says
she's not in the mood,

27:06.255 --> 27:08.005
and then I hear her
sneak off into the bathroom

27:08.089 --> 27:10.506
and it sounds like
a helicopter leaving Saigon.

27:12.756 --> 27:16.756
Did you tell that joke
while you were fucking
her in New Jersey?

27:16.839 --> 27:19.631
I didn't...
I didn't cheat on you.

27:19.714 --> 27:21.422
I've never-- I've never even
thought about cheating.

27:21.506 --> 27:25.047
I have eyeballs
and I can see everything
that's going on!

27:27.923 --> 27:31.339
I see everything!

27:34.464 --> 27:37.381
-I know what's up, Pete.
-What's up?

27:38.130 --> 27:40.047
-What's up? What's up?
-(mocking): What's up?

27:40.130 --> 27:41.798
-What's up?
-What's going on?

27:41.881 --> 27:45.589
(with deaf accent):
Do you understand the words
I'm saying right now?

27:45.673 --> 27:47.297
Jesus.

27:47.381 --> 27:48.714
What the fuck
are you doing?

27:48.798 --> 27:50.047
What do you mean
what the fuck am I doing?

27:50.130 --> 27:51.464
You can't do deaf--
What are you--

27:51.547 --> 27:53.214
Why can't I do it,
comedy police?

27:53.297 --> 27:54.798
Why can't I do
fucking deaf voice?

27:54.881 --> 27:57.255
You sound like a bully
in an '80s movie.

27:57.339 --> 28:00.714
Well, you're... You suck!

28:00.798 --> 28:03.130
You're a shitty boyfriend.

28:04.589 --> 28:06.839
And you're
an even shittier comic.

28:06.923 --> 28:09.089
Okay, can you get
out of the street?

28:09.172 --> 28:11.381
-You're a shitty joke.
-Can you get out
of the street, please?

28:11.464 --> 28:13.839
You get out
of the street!

28:13.923 --> 28:18.047
-Get on the
fucking sidewalk.
-I'll do what I want!

28:22.255 --> 28:24.673
Yo, Pete, man.
You gotta get out
of the street, dude.

28:24.756 --> 28:27.798
Yeah. I saw a guy
got hit out here
like two days ago.

28:27.881 --> 28:29.589
He's fucking dead.

28:30.422 --> 28:32.089
Yeah.

28:32.172 --> 28:33.714
-Sorry.
-Come on.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.839
Babe, you were
so good tonight.

28:37.923 --> 28:40.923
Did you have fun,
my pretty, pretty princess?

28:41.005 --> 28:42.589
-I did.
-Good.

28:42.673 --> 28:45.881
Now, if I can just
find the pin drop
of where my car is.

28:45.964 --> 28:48.047
-Where'd you park?
-Like five blocks.

28:48.130 --> 28:50.214
I'm going to walk
her to her Fiat.

28:50.297 --> 28:51.631
-No.
-I am.

28:52.964 --> 28:54.172
-All right.
-Be right back.

28:54.255 --> 28:55.881
He really is the best.
Come on.

28:55.964 --> 28:58.089
I don't deserve him.

29:00.798 --> 29:03.381
-Ah. Hi, hi.
-Hey.

29:03.464 --> 29:05.214
-Great set.
-Thank you.

29:05.297 --> 29:06.881
Everything you
wanted it to be.

29:06.964 --> 29:08.673
Yeah, it was good.

29:08.756 --> 29:11.047
Hey, congrats.
I'm gonna go get started
on that action plan.

29:11.130 --> 29:14.464
Okay, yeah. I didn't
ask you to do that.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.214
(sighs)

29:17.297 --> 29:18.798
Where's Kat?

29:18.881 --> 29:21.214
Kat and I just had
a really big fight,

29:21.297 --> 29:23.089
in the middle
of the street.

29:23.172 --> 29:24.881
Oh, shit.

29:24.964 --> 29:28.964
And it ended with her screaming
about your penis joke.

29:30.756 --> 29:33.673
Yeah, I know.

29:33.756 --> 29:36.589
She kind of cornered me
in the bathroom.

29:36.673 --> 29:41.130
-She confronted me
after my set about the joke.
-For fuck's sake, really?

29:41.214 --> 29:43.214
I don't think
she liked it.

29:43.297 --> 29:45.047
I was made
aware of that.

29:45.130 --> 29:46.631
She's scary.
I didn't know!

29:46.714 --> 29:49.714
-Maybe she was just upset.
-She did deaf voice to me.

29:49.798 --> 29:51.422
-Just now.
-What?

29:51.506 --> 29:53.839
-In front of-- People were
watching and she did--
-What does that mean?

29:53.923 --> 29:56.923
-(with deaf accent): Do you--
-No! Stop. I get it, I get it.

29:57.005 --> 29:58.798
It was horrifying.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.464
People say dumb shit
when they're fighting.

30:01.547 --> 30:03.255
Not in deaf voice,
they don't.

30:03.339 --> 30:04.381
Yeah.

30:05.756 --> 30:07.756
I think I'm in
over my head.

30:09.089 --> 30:10.214
I'm sorry.

30:11.255 --> 30:13.214
-Okay.
-Um...

30:13.297 --> 30:16.130
Well, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go.

30:16.214 --> 30:18.756
-Okay.
-I gotta go find Ted.

30:21.047 --> 30:22.839
I really am sorry.

30:26.589 --> 30:29.381
Okay. All right.

but you said "pissed"
on stage tonight.

33:26.172 --> 33:27.130
I shouldn't do that?

33:27.214 --> 33:29.130
No, no. It's a bodily function.

33:29.214 --> 33:30.130
-That was just--

That's the definition
of ghosting.

we shouldn't be together?
