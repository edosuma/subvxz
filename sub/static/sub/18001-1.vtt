08:56.610 --> 08:58.527
<i>Now, in tusk there's a little scene</i>

08:58.562 --> 09:00.479
with two girls behind the counter

09:00.531 --> 09:01.730
at a convenience store.

09:01.782 --> 09:04.283
And one of the little girls
was my daughter, Harley.

09:04.318 --> 09:06.902
The other one was her
friend, Lily-rose depp.

09:06.904 --> 09:10.039
So I came up with the
notion of spinning off

09:10.074 --> 09:11.373
those two characters.

09:11.409 --> 09:13.625
<i>So I wrote this movie called Yoga Hosers.</i>

09:13.661 --> 09:15.794
So I'm figuring, before she plays a clerk

09:15.830 --> 09:18.330
in the movie, let me send her to the stash.

09:18.382 --> 09:20.082
So what are your expectations?

09:20.134 --> 09:22.835
What do you hope to really
get out of this crash course

09:22.887 --> 09:24.837
in clerking? I wanna learn how to

09:24.889 --> 09:26.672
react to the customers.

09:26.724 --> 09:28.757
I wanna learn how to use a cash register.

09:28.759 --> 09:30.759
All right. Well, I'll just tell you this:

09:30.761 --> 09:33.012
The things you learn here at the stash,

09:33.064 --> 09:35.647
they're probably gonna stay
with you for a lifetime.

09:35.683 --> 09:39.234
You've always treated the job as religion

09:39.270 --> 09:42.021
more than just, you know,
something to get paid to do.

09:42.073 --> 09:44.907
You know, I do treat the job of a clerk

09:44.942 --> 09:49.161
with the dignity and respect
I think it doesn't always get.

09:49.196 --> 09:51.864
Your movie doesn't help, really...

09:51.916 --> 09:53.532
[Laughter] How ironic.

09:53.584 --> 09:56.168
'Cause my movie made
your clerking possible.

09:56.203 --> 09:59.955
You've done a huge disservice
to clerks everywhere.

10:00.007 --> 10:01.874
All right, you guys ready to get started?

10:01.926 --> 10:03.092
- Yeah, for sure.
- All right.

10:03.127 --> 10:04.676
Let's let the education commence.

10:04.712 --> 10:05.677
Come on right back here.

10:05.713 --> 10:07.679
- Ooh!
- Huh?

10:07.715 --> 10:09.631
This is a different feel already, right?

10:09.683 --> 10:12.134
Yeah. I feel like a new person.

10:12.186 --> 10:14.436
Grab the money and run!

10:14.472 --> 10:16.138
Here we go. Our first customer.

10:16.140 --> 10:18.107
I would like to sell
you some zombie babies.

10:18.142 --> 10:19.108
Zombie babies?

10:19.143 --> 10:21.477
Um, okay, that looks illegal.

10:23.102 --> 10:24.935
Without a doubt, the worst clerk

10:24.970 --> 10:27.471
I've ever dealt with in
my life was Jason Mewes.

10:27.523 --> 10:28.856
Do you remember like, we let him work

10:28.891 --> 10:31.392
at the counter of his own
store, this store called

10:31.394 --> 10:33.394
Jay and silent Bob's secret stash.

10:33.446 --> 10:35.612
So he would go in, and
open up, and you know,

10:35.648 --> 10:37.648
like, all of a sudden, you'd walk in,

10:37.700 --> 10:39.783
<i>there'd be Jay from
clerks behind the counter.</i>

10:39.819 --> 10:42.486
<i>And then Jay from clerks would say to you,</i>

10:42.538 --> 10:44.571
"can you watch the store?
I gotta go get cigarettes."

10:44.623 --> 10:47.491
[Laughter]

10:47.543 --> 10:50.327
And leave the store in the hands of people

10:50.379 --> 10:51.879
who had traveled far to see it.

10:51.914 --> 10:54.164
- Round
- Trip, it would take him ten minutes.

10:54.216 --> 10:56.166
It was... it was a while.
It would be bizarre.

10:56.218 --> 10:58.552
I came into the store once,
and there was a couple there,

10:58.587 --> 11:00.087
and they were not from New Jersey.

11:00.139 --> 11:01.088
And they were like, "oh, it's you!"

11:01.140 --> 11:02.089
And I was like, "welcome,"

11:02.141 --> 11:03.307
and I was greeting them and stuff.

11:03.342 --> 11:05.392
And I was like, "uh, Jay's here too. Jay?"

11:05.428 --> 11:06.727
And they were like, "no, he's not,

11:06.762 --> 11:07.761
he went to get cigarettes."

11:07.813 --> 11:09.480
[Laughter]

11:19.206 --> 11:20.956
Do you have a touch screen tablet?

11:21.008 --> 11:22.207
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

11:22.209 --> 11:24.343
It's very similar to that. Okay.

11:24.378 --> 11:25.627
A lot of miles on this register.

11:25.679 --> 11:26.712
- Mm.
- Hmm.

11:26.764 --> 11:29.214
Any questions before you begin?

11:29.216 --> 11:32.134
Well, it's kind of, actually,
nothing like a touch screen.

11:32.186 --> 11:34.186
So why don't you use a new one?

11:34.221 --> 11:35.721
At Jay and silent Bob's, like,

11:35.773 --> 11:37.639
our motto is: "We've got to keep it real."

11:37.691 --> 11:38.974
Keep it real.

11:39.026 --> 11:40.559
That's translated as, "it's a piece of crap

11:40.611 --> 11:43.312
and he doesn't wanna learn anything new."

11:43.364 --> 11:44.780
Fair enough.

11:44.815 --> 11:48.734
Before we go any further,
let's bring out the key players

11:48.769 --> 11:50.068
in this passionate play.

11:50.104 --> 11:51.820
Ladies and gentleman, without further ado,

11:51.872 --> 11:54.956
my two children, my
daughter, Harley Quinn Smith,

11:54.992 --> 11:56.291
my son, Jason Mewes.

11:56.327 --> 11:57.626
Come on out, kids.

11:57.661 --> 12:00.295
- Woo!
- Yo!

12:00.331 --> 12:01.296
Thanks, thanks.

12:01.332 --> 12:02.581
Welcome to the table. How are you?

12:02.633 --> 12:03.832
I am great.

12:03.884 --> 12:06.084
I sent you here to learn how to be a clerk

12:06.136 --> 12:08.804
<i>so you can play a clerk
in the movie, Yoga Hosers.</i>

12:08.839 --> 12:10.922
So, how did it go, man?

12:10.974 --> 12:12.090
I think it went pretty well.

12:12.142 --> 12:14.426
I definitely learned a lot of information

12:14.478 --> 12:16.228
that will help me when we film.

12:16.263 --> 12:17.596
You're not a working stiff.

12:17.598 --> 12:20.265
So this is like, the first
time you've actually spent

12:20.267 --> 12:22.601
six to eight hours
somewhere where you had to be

12:22.653 --> 12:23.985
in some room... what was that like?

12:24.021 --> 12:25.987
It wasn't bad.

12:26.023 --> 12:27.155
There was a chair.

12:27.191 --> 12:28.907
It was pretty comfortable.

12:28.942 --> 12:29.991
That's my kid! She's like,

12:30.027 --> 12:33.111
"it wasn't bad. There was a chair."

12:33.163 --> 12:34.529
Go ahead though... see if you got

12:34.581 --> 12:35.697
your dad's magic touch.

12:35.749 --> 12:37.282
So you touch this first?

12:37.334 --> 12:39.084
- Nope, nope.
- The... the number?

12:39.119 --> 12:40.952
- Price.
- The price...

12:40.954 --> 12:42.671
- hol... hold up.
- Okay, okay.

12:42.706 --> 12:43.955
[Laughter]

12:44.007 --> 12:45.624
Hi! How you doin'?

12:45.626 --> 12:46.792
Here we go, our first customer.

12:46.844 --> 12:48.293
I have something you
might be interested in.

12:48.345 --> 12:51.012
Okay, but real quick,
I'd just like to introduce

12:51.048 --> 12:52.964
our intern, Harley.

12:53.016 --> 12:54.299
- Hi
- Hi, Harley, nice to meet you.

12:54.351 --> 12:55.550
She's just learning the ropes.

12:55.602 --> 12:57.469
- Kevin Smith's daughter.
- Oh, really?

12:57.521 --> 12:59.137
Why are you telling her that for?

12:59.189 --> 13:00.772
That has no bearing on
what's gonna happen right now.

13:00.808 --> 13:02.474
Well, I just need to let
people know so they...

13:02.476 --> 13:03.809
nah, no special treatment.

13:03.861 --> 13:06.111
Didn't you just learn
we got to keep it real?

13:06.146 --> 13:07.312
That's true, keepin' it reals but...

13:07.314 --> 13:08.563
- all right.
- Good lord.

13:08.615 --> 13:09.815
What can we do for you today?

13:09.867 --> 13:12.401
I would like to sell
you some zombie babies.

13:12.453 --> 13:14.202
Zombie babies?

13:17.040 --> 13:19.491
Um, okay. That looks illegal.

13:27.384 --> 13:29.134
These look like customs.
Did you make these?

13:29.169 --> 13:30.135
Yes.

13:30.170 --> 13:31.887
The detail work is incredible.

13:31.922 --> 13:33.171
What else you got?

13:33.173 --> 13:36.174
This is a toddler. Would
you like to hold her?

13:36.226 --> 13:37.559
Sure. Ah.

13:37.594 --> 13:39.428
- And this is our 24
- Inch toddler.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.514
Just curious... why are they all underage?

13:42.566 --> 13:46.685
Why are they babies? Is
there no 18 or older zombies?

13:46.687 --> 13:48.904
There are no 18 or older dolls.

13:48.939 --> 13:50.739
How'd you get into making zombie dolls?

13:50.774 --> 13:53.325
A few years ago, I wanted
to do a Halloween costume

13:53.360 --> 13:56.027
that had a zombie baby, and
I couldn't find one to buy.

13:56.079 --> 13:57.529
So I decided I can make my own.

13:57.531 --> 13:59.281
And everybody loved it,

13:59.333 --> 14:01.416
so I decided I could sell my own.

14:01.452 --> 14:03.535
What did you dress up as
that you needed a zombie baby?

14:03.537 --> 14:04.786
A zombie mother?

14:04.838 --> 14:07.589
- Yes. Breast
- Feeding.

14:07.624 --> 14:08.757
Okay.

14:08.792 --> 14:11.626
Her first transaction was a buy,

14:11.678 --> 14:13.378
which is always a bit more challenging

14:13.430 --> 14:16.131
you know, it's... you know,
anybody can sell something

14:16.183 --> 14:17.549
'cause someone's bringing
up something that they want.

14:17.601 --> 14:19.267
- Right, right.
- That's easy.

14:19.303 --> 14:21.219
But when you're... when
someone wants to come in

14:21.271 --> 14:24.139
and sell something,
then you gotta negotiate.

14:24.191 --> 14:26.391
All right. So you feeling that, like,

14:26.443 --> 14:28.143
this is something that you can envision

14:28.195 --> 14:29.444
on the shelves at the stash?

14:29.480 --> 14:30.779
I see potential.

14:30.814 --> 14:32.030
I think they're pretty cool.

14:32.065 --> 14:33.365
Yeah? Okay, all right.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.783
Anything you wanna ask her?

14:36.236 --> 14:37.736
How much...

14:37.788 --> 14:40.789
- She...
- Would you like to sell it for?

14:40.824 --> 14:41.823
Excellent.

14:41.875 --> 14:44.159
The larger ones, I sell for $100

14:44.211 --> 14:47.078
and the little one for $30.

14:47.080 --> 14:50.248
Here's where the negotiation begins.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.083
Buckle in, 'cause it's about to get bumpy.

14:52.085 --> 14:53.251
Oh, God.

14:53.253 --> 14:56.054
Maybe we should huddle up and get a...

14:56.089 --> 14:58.223
do you feel you're ready
to throw a counteroffer

14:58.258 --> 14:59.591
back at her?

14:59.593 --> 15:01.927
'Cause you can't go in...
you gotta say it like...

15:01.929 --> 15:03.762
- Like it's like...
- Ah, yeah, shoulders back,

15:03.764 --> 15:05.764
lookin' 'em dead in the face.

15:05.766 --> 15:07.265
Eyes, you know? Not crazy eyes.

15:07.317 --> 15:08.817
- $100.
- Mm-mm, crazy eyes.

15:08.852 --> 15:11.152
No, no, more like confident eyes.

15:11.188 --> 15:12.437
$100.

15:12.489 --> 15:13.688
- Not seductive eyes.
- Okay.

15:13.740 --> 15:14.689
Just confident eyes.

15:14.741 --> 15:16.691
$100.

15:16.743 --> 15:18.159
That's it.
That's bet... that's it.

15:18.195 --> 15:20.612
It's time to step up and negotiate.

15:20.614 --> 15:23.081
I think you come back
with a counteroffer of 160.

15:23.116 --> 15:25.083
- For all of them?
- For all of them.

15:25.118 --> 15:26.785
And don't worry about disappointing her.

15:26.837 --> 15:29.037
You know, at the stash,
we live to disappoint.

15:29.089 --> 15:30.422
[Quietly] She's standing right there.

15:30.457 --> 15:32.090
She can hear you.

15:33.844 --> 15:35.961
- He's right, I can.
- [Overlapping chatter]

15:35.963 --> 15:39.264
We discussed it, as you may have heard,

15:39.299 --> 15:42.467
and we said 160.

15:42.469 --> 15:44.970
For 160,

15:45.022 --> 15:46.471
congratulations, it's a baby.

15:46.523 --> 15:50.141
It's so good doing business with you.

15:50.143 --> 15:52.727
What was it like doing the
actual transaction, man?

15:52.779 --> 15:54.145
What'd you feel like?

15:54.197 --> 15:55.447
It was a rush.

15:55.482 --> 15:57.032
It felt great.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.984
A rush? What are you teaching this kid?

15:58.986 --> 16:00.368
I know. What kind of teacher are you?

16:00.404 --> 16:01.736
She's gonna be chasing that dragon

16:01.788 --> 16:02.954
for the rest of her life now.

16:02.990 --> 16:04.489
You're turning her into an addict, man.

16:04.541 --> 16:06.958
She's like, "I gotta go
sell some dolls today!"

16:06.994 --> 16:08.326
I wanna do it again!

16:08.328 --> 16:09.494
- Right?
- I feel great!

16:09.496 --> 16:11.162
I'm gonna go play with these.

16:13.133 --> 16:15.834
We are asking 175 for it.

16:15.836 --> 16:18.503
- I got...
- 156.

16:18.555 --> 16:21.506
All right, Harley. You're
in the hot seat now.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.213
Has your time here been
well spent, do you think?

16:30.224 --> 16:31.306
You learning things?

16:31.342 --> 16:33.258
Yeah, I'm learning a few things.

16:33.310 --> 16:35.177
What are some of the
things that they've, uh,

16:35.229 --> 16:37.396
that they've imparted to you
that you feel are valuable?

16:37.431 --> 16:39.264
The customer's always right.

16:39.316 --> 16:40.432
- No.
- No?

16:40.484 --> 16:43.602
<i>No. Have you ever seen Mallrats?</i>

16:43.654 --> 16:45.270
Your dad, in one sentence,

16:45.272 --> 16:48.657
summed up the entire retail experience.

16:48.692 --> 16:51.993
And that is: "The customer
is always an [Bleep]."

16:52.029 --> 16:54.162
All right. That makes more sense.

16:54.198 --> 16:55.981
<i>Back when we made clerks,</i>

16:56.016 --> 16:58.650
me and Bryan Johnson were actually clerks

16:58.685 --> 17:00.585
at quick stop and at R.S.T. video.

17:00.621 --> 17:03.355
We sat there hating having to press buttons

17:03.390 --> 17:05.991
to have to reach up and grab
somebody a pack of cigarettes.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.926
I hated it so much that, like,
if I was stationed at R.S.T.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.127
- I would just close the store...
- [Laughs] Yes.

17:10.164 --> 17:11.430
And put a sign up that said,

17:11.464 --> 17:13.165
"if you want a movie, come
to the convenience store,"

17:13.200 --> 17:15.133
so I could sit with him. [Laughter]

17:15.135 --> 17:17.685
For as much as we sat
there complaining about it,

17:17.721 --> 17:20.972
I got rich off of it, so...

17:27.146 --> 17:28.980
- How are you doing, sir?
- Hey, how's it it going?

17:28.982 --> 17:30.615
- What's up?
- Good, good.

17:30.651 --> 17:33.318
<i>Uh, I saw a Green Hornet Statue up front.</i>

17:33.320 --> 17:34.653
Oh, the electric tiki?

17:34.705 --> 17:36.321
Yes. I'd like to take a
better look at it if I could.

17:36.373 --> 17:37.322
Yeah, let me go grab it for you.

17:37.374 --> 17:38.373
Thanks.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.716
This is awesome, man.

17:47.751 --> 17:48.967
Kato with the dart.

17:49.002 --> 17:50.552
Right. What's this?

17:50.587 --> 17:52.671
<i>The Hornet sting, son.</i>

17:52.723 --> 17:54.089
So this is the Green Hornet?

17:54.141 --> 17:55.674
- Yup.
- And this is Kato?

17:55.676 --> 17:57.225
- Yup.
- What does Kato do?

17:57.261 --> 17:58.560
Kato is like the muscle.

17:58.595 --> 17:59.561
A lot of people think of the green hornet

17:59.596 --> 18:00.645
as the main character.

18:00.681 --> 18:01.680
No, I always thought it was Kato

18:01.682 --> 18:03.014
that was the main character.

18:03.066 --> 18:05.350
He looked kind of like me.
He was played by Bruce Lee.

18:05.402 --> 18:06.852
Like he was what... He fights like you.

18:06.854 --> 18:08.353
Well, all right. Let's not go too far.

18:08.405 --> 18:10.405
He was a guy I wanted to be.

18:10.441 --> 18:11.857
It's true. Most people kind of

18:11.909 --> 18:13.191
just always say the green hornet.

18:13.243 --> 18:15.527
They don't say, he green hornet and Kato.

18:15.579 --> 18:17.362
<i>Like, even the show, here,
was called the green hornet.</i>

18:17.414 --> 18:19.197
Yeah, but, you know, when
the show went to Asia,

18:19.249 --> 18:20.532
<i>it was called the Kato show.</i>

18:20.584 --> 18:22.701
- Oh, really? Was it?
- Yeah. Yeah, they, you know,

18:22.703 --> 18:23.952
they didn't even put any
green hornet in there.

18:24.004 --> 18:26.087
It was all Kato, and I always loved that.

18:26.123 --> 18:28.089
And when the show goes to China, you know,

18:28.125 --> 18:29.841
<i>they might just call it the ming show.</i>

18:29.877 --> 18:32.294
[Laughter]

18:32.346 --> 18:34.045
<i>Or, you know, or at the
very least, ming and friends.</i>

18:34.081 --> 18:36.381
Now I could stand around and
talk green hornet and Kato

18:36.383 --> 18:41.186
all day, but we are asking 175 for it.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.472
Can I take a moment to check the fuzz?

18:43.524 --> 18:44.723
Go right ahead.

18:44.725 --> 18:46.057
What do you got?

18:46.109 --> 18:48.059
I got one potato,

18:48.061 --> 18:49.060
two potato...

18:49.112 --> 18:51.313
- 50...
- 50...

18:51.365 --> 18:52.314
All right. And...

18:52.366 --> 18:55.617
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

18:55.652 --> 18:58.370
156.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.071
All right, Harley.

19:00.073 --> 19:01.873
You're in the hot seat now.

19:01.909 --> 19:03.208
This is what being a clerk is about.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.327
Sometimes there's a lot of pressure.

19:05.379 --> 19:06.711
You can either make...

19:06.747 --> 19:09.247
- Oh, no.
- An extra $14 or not.

19:09.299 --> 19:10.799
So it's the moment of truth, man.

19:10.834 --> 19:12.000
He put you in the hot seat.

19:12.052 --> 19:13.635
You had to make the decision.

19:13.670 --> 19:15.504
That decision where you were gonna be

19:15.556 --> 19:17.506
a human being or a clerk.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.593
You know, you seem like a really nice guy.

19:21.595 --> 19:22.761
I know.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.931
<i>And you really like the green hornet.</i>

19:25.983 --> 19:29.868
So I think we should
give it to you for 150.

19:29.903 --> 19:31.520
- Thank you.
- You're so welcome.

19:31.572 --> 19:33.321
Whoa, whoa, whoa, bro.

19:33.357 --> 19:34.823
I thought you were security, dude.

19:34.858 --> 19:36.775
Now I'm gonna take your 6.00 bucks

19:36.777 --> 19:38.276
as payment for that mistake.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.661
Yeah, we're taking this.

19:39.696 --> 19:42.163
Look at that! Making business calls.

19:42.199 --> 19:44.366
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

19:44.418 --> 19:47.869
I came to the consensus
that he seems like a nice guy

19:47.921 --> 19:49.921
and I thought he could
be a returning customer.

19:49.957 --> 19:52.374
I was disappointed by her humanity, but...

19:52.426 --> 19:54.593
[Laughter]

19:54.628 --> 19:55.760
Ming, you wanna give him a hand?

19:55.796 --> 19:57.295
Take this up front, box it up.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.047
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

19:59.099 --> 20:00.131
Thank you!

20:00.183 --> 20:01.516
- Take care.
- Enjoy.

20:01.552 --> 20:02.634
Harley, ring in your sale.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.352
- Oh, yeah.
- Well done.

20:04.388 --> 20:06.304
Ah.

20:06.306 --> 20:09.274
Absolutely sounds like
it was successful trip,

20:09.309 --> 20:10.442
particularly for you, man.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.060
There was an idea, go out there,

20:12.112 --> 20:14.195
get behind the counter, get
some clerking experience.

20:14.231 --> 20:15.251
We come back and make the movie...

20:15.251 --> 20:17.566
- do you feel that you did that?
- I think so.

20:17.618 --> 20:19.985
I feel like I know a lot more
than I did when I started,

20:19.987 --> 20:21.152
and I think I can do it now.

20:21.204 --> 20:22.704
No kidding around,

20:22.739 --> 20:24.406
if the movie thing doesn't work out,

20:24.458 --> 20:25.874
I got a place for you at the stash.

20:25.909 --> 20:26.992
Thank you.

20:27.044 --> 20:29.661
And honestly, that
should terrify any parent.

20:29.713 --> 20:31.830
Hearing that, but that made me happy.

20:31.832 --> 20:33.882
It was nice to see you bonding

20:33.917 --> 20:35.333
with the people that made me who I am.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.802
And hopefully, just the way they shaped me

20:37.838 --> 20:39.504
throughout my life, maybe they shaped you

20:39.506 --> 20:40.839
just a little bit.

20:40.841 --> 20:42.090
Just a little, not too much.

20:42.142 --> 20:44.676
[Laughter]

20:44.711 --> 20:46.394
There it is, folks.

20:46.430 --> 20:47.729
Teach your children well.

20:47.764 --> 20:49.681
And if you can't, let
your friends do it, man.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.566
For Comic Book Men, I'm Kevin Smith.

20:51.602 --> 20:53.301
- I'm Harley Quinn.
- Bryan Johnson.

20:53.325 --> 20:55.325
- Walt Flanagan.
- Jason Mewes.

20:55.349 --> 20:57.042
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:57.042 --> 21:01.097
To quote the immortal Darth Vader:
"Harley I am your father."

21:01.671 --> 21:02.213
Good night.
