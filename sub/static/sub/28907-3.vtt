this scout to the ground.

keep it that way.

"hey, why not make it a killer
one-of-a-kind car

01:42.500 --> 01:45.100
that no one's even had the guts
to dream up yet."

01:49.000 --> 01:50.470
man: What is that?

01:50.470 --> 01:53.640
So, I paid 12,500 bucks for it

slammed cali cruiser

02:06.690 --> 02:09.460
with the same '70s dna
of the original scout,

02:09.460 --> 02:12.530
but it packs a 707-horsepower
hellcrate engine

02:12.530 --> 02:14.930
capable of
racetrack speeds.

02:14.930 --> 02:17.060
But the monkeys thought
we were building a drag car.

02:17.070 --> 02:19.070
I did not ever say,
"build a drag car."

02:19.070 --> 02:21.440

six figures for one of those?

02:27.140 --> 02:28.710
But they soon caught on
to my idea.

02:28.710 --> 02:31.750
Once I had a hard look at those
sweet rims from revo forged,

02:31.750 --> 02:33.280
the custom,
high-performance chassis

02:33.280 --> 02:35.120
from chris
alston's chassisworks,

02:35.120 --> 02:36.520
and the killer hellcrate
motor...

02:36.520 --> 02:37.850
Freaking rad.

02:37.850 --> 02:40.020
...I realized I could probably
sell the beast

02:40.020 --> 02:41.420
for more than 200 grand.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.360
And I would soon call this
monster the

02:43.360 --> 02:45.730
"the scout to hell."

02:45.730 --> 02:47.930
ooh, I like
the sound of that.

02:47.930 --> 02:50.360
But things did a nosedive
when the monkeys realized...

02:50.370 --> 02:53.630
This front sump pan
is not gonna clear.

02:53.640 --> 02:54.970
It'll put our motor, like,
through the hood.

02:54.970 --> 02:56.770
Our driveshaft
will be too high.

02:56.770 --> 02:58.610

with the hellcrate

the front crossmember

03:00.110 --> 03:03.410
on our custom-built chassis.

03:03.410 --> 03:06.050
So, today, the correct-fitting
rear-facing oil pan

03:06.050 --> 03:07.250
and the [indistinct]

03:07.250 --> 03:09.250

have just arrived,

that'll get us back in gear.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.590
John:
It sits in place.

03:12.590 --> 03:13.920
Oh, so you have to bolt the pan
on first,

03:13.920 --> 03:15.260
then, this bolts over top.

03:15.260 --> 03:17.420
So, there's four bolts
that go in here from here

03:17.430 --> 03:18.760
to the block of the motor.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.230
Waiting on parts,
even if they're over-nighted,

03:21.230 --> 03:23.030
causes delays
we don't need.

03:23.030 --> 03:25.730
So, john's gonna go ahead
and get the rear sump oil pan

03:25.730 --> 03:28.370
and the collar
married to the hellcrate.

03:28.370 --> 03:30.840
Then, he can get it all bolted
to the transmission.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.910

08:18.930 --> 08:20.960

It's sitting in the back.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.830
And somehow, lack
of communication --

08:22.830 --> 08:25.130

in an automotive shop --

08:25.130 --> 08:26.370

Oh, look at that.
That's special.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.300

and hope for the best?

some hair on it.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.710
No. I can't even find
the little slot.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.950

for a second.

Alright, cool.

09:01.770 --> 09:03.300

09:03.310 --> 09:05.840
I got my key right here.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.140
You want to go fast?

09:07.140 --> 09:08.580

At least my
window's down.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.580
No kidding.

09:12.580 --> 09:14.980
You know, there's a lot of stuff
on these cars in '63.

09:14.980 --> 09:16.450
They were '63 only --

09:16.450 --> 09:19.220
like, this glove box door's
fiberglass instead of steel.

09:19.220 --> 09:20.690
It's a one-year-only hood.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.260
They only made
about 10,000 coups,

09:22.260 --> 09:24.520
and only 1,000
had automatics.

09:24.530 --> 09:27.860
Isn't it cool?

09:27.860 --> 09:29.830
It still runs good.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.460
So, the car drives
really well.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.570
The window doesn't work
on my side, so it's hot.

09:33.570 --> 09:35.570
But other than that,
the brakes feel good,

09:35.570 --> 09:36.800
the steering feels good.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.100
The suspension
and everything's tight.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.440
I mean, it drives like
a 12,000-mile corvette.

09:42.580 --> 09:44.110
I know this is
a valuable corvette,

09:44.110 --> 09:45.950
but if dennis can float me
a buddy deal on it,

09:45.950 --> 09:48.580
I might just be able to make
some sweet green on the flip.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.480
Alright,
how much is it?

09:50.490 --> 09:52.620
71 grand.

09:52.620 --> 09:53.820
Why $71,000?

09:53.820 --> 09:56.190
Chris:
It's better than $72,000.

09:56.190 --> 09:57.520
So, I started
with 71 grand

09:57.530 --> 09:58.890
'cause I kind of
looked around --

09:58.890 --> 10:01.430
that being the average for
project cars, believe it or not.

10:01.430 --> 10:02.760
I think more like $50,000.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.460
I figured that's what
you were gonna think.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.970
-How do you figure $50,000?
-It's pretty easy.

10:06.970 --> 10:09.170
It's $21,000 less
than what he said.

10:09.170 --> 10:11.200
I say $50,000,
he's at $70,000.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.710
I know we're going
to $60,000.

10:12.710 --> 10:14.370
It's just how long it's gonna
take us to get there.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.940
I mean, you already hung me out
on the pantera

10:15.940 --> 10:17.340

for kurt busch.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.580
I did pretty good on that.

10:18.580 --> 10:20.250
Oh, I know.
And I was in a deep spot.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.320
I had to have it.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.380
125 grand.
It's worth it.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.290
No, I still haven't
gotten over the raw deal

10:26.290 --> 10:27.690
dennis cut for me
on the pantera.

10:27.690 --> 10:29.320
And that's why
I'm bringing it up.

at all, man.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.500

to be leather.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.970

that exact plaid.

Why, all of a sudden, white?

this car is tops off,

it's down low, you're cruising
in a major boulevard.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.130
I can do with or
without the white,

12:45.130 --> 12:47.060
but at the same time,
then, it becomes this dark

12:47.060 --> 12:50.260

with this bright,

12:50.270 --> 12:52.400

12:56.570 --> 12:59.640

-Yes.

to a tan,
