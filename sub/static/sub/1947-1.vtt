Something splashy.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.654
Actually,

17:02.822 --> 17:05.415
I had in mind
something different.

17:13.124 --> 17:16.502
I've been thinking
about an early campaign.

17:17.712 --> 17:20.590

I was but a boy.

17:22.090 --> 17:25.060
We dropped from the sky
and did what Necromongers do.

17:27.221 --> 17:30.896
Destruction was breathtaking.

17:33.436 --> 17:35.279
But then we met resistance.

17:36.898 --> 17:39.401
Ferocious like
a storm of lions.

17:42.278 --> 17:45.282
Each one of them killed
over a hundred Necro

17:46.115 --> 17:47.958
before their weapons failed.

17:50.787 --> 17:53.040
And then they killed
another 30 more.

17:53.956 --> 17:55.208
Barehanded.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.634
Our firepower
and strength in numbers

18:00.755 --> 18:02.553
eventually won us the day.

18:03.966 --> 18:07.891
I can still see him, the last
of those magnificent warriors,

18:08.388 --> 18:10.311
standing on a pile
of his own.

18:12.809 --> 18:14.527
And he looked at me.

18:18.064 --> 18:21.113
And I will never
forget those eyes.

18:28.157 --> 18:31.752
His eyes were just like yours.

18:36.499 --> 18:39.343
The planet was Furya.

18:40.211 --> 18:42.384

know where it is.

(CHUCKLES)

01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:49.293
I believe this is a sign.

01:14:51.996 --> 01:14:54.795
It may be that the good Lord
wants us to take these nodes

01:14:55.082 --> 01:14:58.302

just as soon as we can.

MOSS: You know, I was kind of
hoping the bomb would go off.

01:15:23.486 --> 01:15:28.083
So we sealed up his cave with some
phosphor frags here, so he can't go back.

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:31.127
And just like an animal, he's
gonna head to known ground.

01:15:31.202 --> 01:15:34.206
But we're gonna find he's got
three or four lairs out there.

01:15:34.288 --> 01:15:37.167
So we'll radius out
from this point, here.

01:15:37.708 --> 01:15:41.554

repeaters listed in inventory.

01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:44.508

at regular intervals.

cut off our own nuts here?

Probably because we did.
