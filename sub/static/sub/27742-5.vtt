♪ Just between you and me ♪

00:04.588 --> 00:07.157
- ♪ Baby, I know ♪
- Hey.

00:08.212 --> 00:10.393
You know, you could just try
talking to her if you want.

00:10.991 --> 00:12.495
Unless you're just
trying to stare at her

00:12.530 --> 00:15.698
until she, I don't know, caves under
the weight of your creepy glare.

00:15.733 --> 00:18.101
- Not staring at her. I wasn't...
- Not staring at her?

00:18.135 --> 00:19.898
- I wasn't staring. I was just...
- What are you doing?

00:19.899 --> 00:20.899
There's something on her...

00:20.938 --> 00:23.406
I don't care, man.
What are we doing this weekend?

00:23.441 --> 00:25.408
I don't... Well, I mean...

00:25.443 --> 00:28.011
Wrong answer, because we, you and I,

00:28.045 --> 00:30.113
are going to Charlottetown to see...

00:30.147 --> 00:33.750
- Laverne!
- What the hell is Laverne?!

00:33.784 --> 00:35.718
Laverne the Incredibilist!
The greatest hypnotist

00:35.753 --> 00:37.654
in the history of the Maritimes?
Remember,

00:37.688 --> 00:41.691
- ♪ You seldom forget Laverne ♪
- "Seldom"?

00:41.725 --> 00:43.660
Yeah, wasn't the most confident slogan.

00:43.694 --> 00:46.563
Mark, I don't want to go to Charlottetown
and see some weird hypnotist

00:46.597 --> 00:48.598
make people think they're
chickens or whatever.

00:48.632 --> 00:50.700
He doesn't make people think
they're chickens, Andy.

00:50.734 --> 00:53.203
He makes them think they
crapped their pants.

00:53.237 --> 00:56.439
- Is that it? That's the only thing he does?
- He doesn't need to do anything else.

00:57.378 --> 01:01.077
- I'm gonna take a hard pass on that. I'm...
- You are insane, man.

01:01.111 --> 01:04.247
We will make a whole day of this.
Do you hear what I'm saying?

01:04.281 --> 01:06.416
- Yeah...
- Get to Charlottetown, we go eat COWS ice cream,

01:06.450 --> 01:08.585
best in the Maritimes,
then we go to Charlottetown's

01:08.619 --> 01:11.688
Empire State Building,
now eight stories high!

01:11.722 --> 01:13.823
And then if there's time before Laverne,
we go watch

01:13.858 --> 01:15.458
<i>Confederation Times</i>. You heard of this?

01:15.493 --> 01:17.093
- No.
- It's a live show

01:17.127 --> 01:19.762
where the original fathers
of Confederation duke it out

01:19.797 --> 01:21.898
with old-timey weapons
while you and I eat

01:21.932 --> 01:23.933
big ol' turkey legs.

01:23.968 --> 01:26.569
OK, fellas... Whoa,

01:26.604 --> 01:29.439
- is that Laverne?
- Oh yeah, yeah! You know him?

01:29.473 --> 01:32.809
AAAH! He is like my favourite
hypnotist of all time.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.144
- You like multiple hypnotists?!
- I always wanted to see him,

01:35.179 --> 01:38.047
but he never came to Cavendish.

01:38.082 --> 01:41.150
Well, we are going to see him
in Charlottetown this weekend.

01:41.185 --> 01:42.952
- If you want to join us...
- Mark...

01:42.987 --> 01:45.388
- Shush, shut up!
- Oh! Oh! Well,

01:45.422 --> 01:48.825
Jacob's with his dad this weekend. But I
was gonna build a little hunting blind,

01:48.860 --> 01:50.193
see if I can't finally
take down that squirrel

01:50.227 --> 01:52.095
that's been ransacking my bird feeder.

01:52.129 --> 01:54.831
- I'm gonna take his eyes when I get him.
- What? Why his eyes?

01:54.865 --> 01:56.533
Then again,
this does sound more fun, so I'm in.

01:56.567 --> 01:58.401
Great news!

01:58.435 --> 02:00.739
Great! Great.

02:07.767 --> 02:09.878
Mark, can we just not do this?
I'm not going.

02:09.913 --> 02:11.981
Come on, Andy, we are going to see

02:12.016 --> 02:14.284
<i>the</i> best hypnotist
in the history of the Maritimes,

02:14.318 --> 02:16.486
and you're gonna have a
whole day to spend time

02:16.520 --> 02:18.521
- getting to know Molly.
- I already know Molly doesn't

02:18.556 --> 02:21.291
like me, I don't want to be
any more humiliated, so no.

02:21.325 --> 02:23.626
Hey, where's
this negativity coming from?

02:23.661 --> 02:25.461
Me! That's who I am.

02:25.496 --> 02:28.031
Well, not today, it's not, OK?
Today, you're New Andy,

02:28.065 --> 02:30.533
Confident Andy, Good Andy,
the kind of Andy

02:30.568 --> 02:32.669
with all those special
talents I know about

02:32.703 --> 02:34.704
that any woman would love.

02:34.738 --> 02:37.073
Talents that include writing...

02:40.177 --> 02:42.645
You're trying to think of a second
compliment for me, aren't you?

02:42.680 --> 02:44.814
Wrong. I'm actually
rethinking the first one

02:44.848 --> 02:47.350
because I said you could write,
but then I was like,

02:47.384 --> 02:50.486
"Can he write?" Never actually
seen any evidence of that.

02:50.521 --> 02:53.122
- That's great. Thank you so much, Mark.
- Anyway.

02:53.157 --> 02:55.858
Why are you bringing so much stuff?
Charlottetown is like

02:55.893 --> 02:58.061
30 minutes away.
This is supposed to be like a day trip.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.929
Hey, it's a road trip, Andy.

02:59.964 --> 03:01.998
And besides, you'll be thanking me
when you get hungry

03:02.032 --> 03:04.534
at minute 10, and I just so
happen to have a cooler full of

03:04.568 --> 03:06.469
deviled eggs.

03:06.503 --> 03:08.404
Haha! Oh, one sec.

03:08.439 --> 03:10.406
- Where are you going?
- I gotta go get my passport

03:10.441 --> 03:13.509
- and my travel pillow.
- It's 30 minutes away!

03:18.849 --> 03:22.606
Oh, my gosh, guys,
I cannot tell you how exciting this is.

03:22.641 --> 03:24.253
Anyone want an egg? Molly, nice egg?

03:24.288 --> 03:27.023
Molly? Everything OK, Molly?

03:27.057 --> 03:29.626
Yeah!
Yeah, I guess I'm just a little nervous.

03:29.660 --> 03:32.729
Never been to the big city before.

03:32.763 --> 03:35.431
Oh, uh... technically,
I-I-I went to Moncton

03:35.466 --> 03:37.734
with my uncle, but we didn't
make it out of the bus station.

03:37.768 --> 03:39.569
- What happened?
- He died.

03:40.479 --> 03:41.604
Got hit by a couple of buses.

03:41.639 --> 03:44.073
- Sorry, "a couple of buses"?
- First bus knocked him

03:44.108 --> 03:46.542
into the second bus.
Third bus finished him off.

03:46.577 --> 03:49.512
So three buses, OK. Well, if that's
what you're worried about, Molly...

03:49.546 --> 03:51.948
That is not all that I am worried about.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.950
What else are you worried about?

03:53.984 --> 03:56.953
The muggings, the murders,
the roving gangs!

03:56.987 --> 03:58.621
There's no roving gangs in Charlottetown

03:58.656 --> 04:01.124
because Charlottetown is not
"the big city," alright?

04:01.158 --> 04:03.292
It's got an entire population of...

04:03.327 --> 04:05.061
- What's the population, Andy?
- 36000.

04:05.095 --> 04:08.097
36000, Molly! That's it, 36000 people!

04:08.132 --> 04:11.668
Christ! Imagine the sound
of all those mouths chewing

04:11.702 --> 04:13.936
- and swallowing at the same time.
- Yeah, imagining

04:13.971 --> 04:16.072
one mouth doing that
would be horrifying,

04:16.106 --> 04:18.808
so instead let's imagine
all the fun we're gonna have

04:18.841 --> 04:23.479
and then stop imagining that
because... we are here.

04:38.454 --> 04:39.552
_

05:09.159 --> 05:11.728
Crazy! When John A. McDonald
smoked Joseph Howe

05:11.762 --> 05:13.730
with that mace, I was like, "What?!"

05:13.764 --> 05:16.332
Ohhh! And then, when Thomas D'Arcy McGee

05:16.366 --> 05:18.968
cut off Ambrose Shea's
arm with that broadsword,

05:19.002 --> 05:21.003
I thought my head was gonna explode.

05:21.038 --> 05:23.172
Hell yeah, you guys.
Well, if you thought that was good,

05:23.207 --> 05:26.709
just wait until we take in
the hypnotic stylings

05:26.744 --> 05:28.711
of Eastern Canada's favourite

05:28.746 --> 05:30.980
- aging hypnotist.
- I honestly can't wait.

05:31.014 --> 05:33.216
- Aaah!
- Hahaha!

05:33.250 --> 05:35.685
- Um, what's wrong?
- Oh, nothing. Just thought

05:35.719 --> 05:38.054
that the Playhouse was
supposed to be around here,

05:38.088 --> 05:42.959
but can't seem to get
a signal anymore, so...

05:42.993 --> 05:44.961
Are you sure this is the right area?

05:44.995 --> 05:47.497
- It seems a bit rough.
- Nah,

05:48.033 --> 05:49.832
I think we're probably close.
Let's keep going.

05:49.867 --> 05:53.336
Let's just keep... keep going.

05:56.373 --> 05:59.909
Alright, we definitely have to turn around,
this is not the way to the Playhouse.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.978
Relax, we still got plenty of time
'til the show.

06:02.012 --> 06:03.980
Besides,
we did turn around 10 minutes ago.

06:04.014 --> 06:06.249
- What?!
- Yeah, OK, we're quite lost.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.217
I don't know what you want me to say.
But it's gonna be fine.

06:08.252 --> 06:10.706
- It's not fine!
- What is fine about this?

06:10.707 --> 06:12.287
It's going to be fine.

06:12.322 --> 06:13.856
- I'm sorry, it's going to be fine.
- It will be fine.

06:13.891 --> 06:16.759
- Where are we? Where are we, Mark?
- I don't know that!

06:16.794 --> 06:18.995
Dear God, this is exactly
what I knew would happen.

06:19.029 --> 06:22.098
Now I'm gonna get kidnapped by a
drug dealer and forced to steal cars.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.433
I don't even know what you're
referencing anymore, Molly.

06:24.468 --> 06:27.236
- Come on, Mark!
- Oh, you get that?!

06:27.271 --> 06:29.272
- Yes. <i>City Fears! City Fears!</i>
<i>- City Fears,</i> Mark.

06:29.306 --> 06:32.008
<i>- City Fears?!</i>
- Don't be dumb! Don't be dumb, Mark!

06:32.042 --> 06:34.710
"Don't be dumb"? You say
that I'm being dumb?! "Shayyshhh!

06:34.745 --> 06:36.546
Shayyyshhh!"

06:36.580 --> 06:39.148
- Both of you, "shaysh!"
- "Shaysh"?

06:39.183 --> 06:42.685
Now you leave this to me,
and I will find a way to...

06:43.410 --> 06:45.388
There we go. Look at that. Look at that.

06:45.422 --> 06:47.256
- What?
- Ask and ye shall receive.

06:47.291 --> 06:48.901
- A fellow man.
- No.

06:48.993 --> 06:51.460
A man who I'm going
to ask for directions.

06:51.495 --> 06:54.230
- Mark... Mark, no, no, no. Don't, don't, don't.
- Oh no!

06:54.264 --> 06:57.033
I'm pretty sure he's not a drug dealer
who's gonna force me to steal cars,

06:57.067 --> 06:59.302
if that's what you're afraid of.
Leave it to me.

07:01.125 --> 07:02.038
Uh, excuse me, sir.

07:02.072 --> 07:04.040
I was hoping you could
give me some directions.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.811
- Oh, dear God!
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

07:08.846 --> 07:10.646
That's the face of a demon.
That's a demon, man,

07:10.681 --> 07:14.116
and he's reaching for something.
Let's go! Pick it up! Let's go!

07:14.117 --> 07:15.117
Let's go, Molly!

07:19.835 --> 07:22.245
OK, OK, OK. Just-just-just calm down.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.147
Just calm down and
forget all about that guy

07:24.181 --> 07:26.216
- and the way that he sounded.
- You still hear his breathing?

07:26.250 --> 07:28.084
- I'm gonna forget it.
- Yeah, yeah, we're all gonna

07:28.118 --> 07:30.086
be hearing that breathing
for a long time.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.288
But that's fine because he's not there,
and we're in here,

07:32.323 --> 07:37.427
so we're good. We're more or less good.

07:37.461 --> 07:41.097
Alright, come on, come on.

07:41.748 --> 07:43.166
Hi, everyone!

07:43.821 --> 07:45.602
Nice place.

07:46.575 --> 07:47.774
Hi there.

07:47.809 --> 07:49.105
Got a quick question for you.

07:49.139 --> 07:52.075
Order first, then ask questions.

07:52.109 --> 07:54.477
Makes sense.
OK, you guys know what you want?

07:54.512 --> 07:56.913
- What's your house red?
- What?!

07:56.947 --> 07:59.476
Jesus, Andy!
We'll just get three beers, please.

07:59.511 --> 08:02.385
So now that we have ordered,
here's my little query...

08:02.420 --> 08:03.786
How the hell do we get
out of Charlottetown?

08:03.821 --> 08:06.189
Not what I was gonna ask.
We're going to the Playhouse;

08:06.223 --> 08:08.591
- do you know how to get to the Playhouse?
- The Playhouse, eh?

08:09.883 --> 08:11.828
You wouldn't happen to be seeing...

08:11.862 --> 08:13.830
Laverne, would you?

08:15.186 --> 08:16.165
Yes.

08:16.667 --> 08:19.093
I knew it! Yes!

08:19.128 --> 08:20.770
He is terrific, isn't he?

08:20.804 --> 08:22.605
The way that he makes people think

08:22.640 --> 08:25.475
that they crapped their pants? Mwah!

08:25.509 --> 08:27.962
- Yeah, we like him a lot.
- Big fans.

08:27.997 --> 08:29.879
The Playhouse is real close.

08:29.914 --> 08:32.315
I've got a map, I'll show it to you.

08:32.349 --> 08:34.984
OK, sounds great. Mmm! Mmm!

08:36.854 --> 08:39.702
- Mark, don't leave us here.
- What's the problem?

08:39.736 --> 08:42.825
I'm gonna be right over there. Just talk
to Molly. Don't be a coward, come on.

08:50.501 --> 08:51.784
Ooh.

08:52.570 --> 08:54.671
Scary place, huh?

08:57.460 --> 08:59.842
- So, we're here.
- OK.

08:59.877 --> 09:02.679
And the Playhouse is there.
Pretty close!

09:02.713 --> 09:05.348
So we must have taken the
wrong turn going up there.

09:05.382 --> 09:07.584
And what's this area
we're in right now called?

09:07.618 --> 09:10.553
- Old Charlottetown.
- Old Charlottetown.

09:10.588 --> 09:12.889
It's mostly pretty nice people
around here, except for the gangs.

09:12.923 --> 09:16.507
Oh, there are gangs? There are
gangs around... gangs around here?

09:16.542 --> 09:17.994
Oh yeah. Swarms of 'em.

09:18.028 --> 09:20.997
- "Swarms."
- And all with their own esthetic theme.

09:21.031 --> 09:23.066
Trashies, Dirtrags,

09:23.100 --> 09:25.468
Scarlet Letters. Technically,

09:25.502 --> 09:29.339
they all have their own turf,
but they tend to rove.

09:31.375 --> 09:34.344
Roving gangs, great.
OK, well, I am gonna keep

09:34.378 --> 09:36.946
that information from
those two over there 'cause

09:36.981 --> 09:39.515
- they might freak out.
- Ah, don't be afraid.

09:39.550 --> 09:42.518
They won't hurt you unless
you cross 'em or they feel like it.

09:51.295 --> 09:53.730
Hey, do you know what I was
thinking of the other day?

09:53.764 --> 09:55.832
Mrs. Finley. Remember her?

09:56.818 --> 09:58.301
- No.
- Our third-grade teacher,

09:58.335 --> 10:00.403
remember her?
She always used to say, uh,

10:01.034 --> 10:02.405
"Pencils down." Remember that?

10:02.439 --> 10:04.874
Every teacher says that.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.043
Yeah, but she would
kind of like emphasize

10:07.077 --> 10:09.646
the "down" part. "Pencils down!"

10:09.680 --> 10:12.315
No. No, I don't remember.

10:13.816 --> 10:15.418
Maybe it was the "pencils"
part that she hit.

10:15.452 --> 10:17.253
It's hard to... I can't do it like her,

10:17.287 --> 10:20.023
but it was pretty... pretty weird.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.527
- Anyway, she's probably dead now.
- Hey, guys!

10:24.561 --> 10:26.562
So I just spoke with, as it turns out,

10:26.597 --> 10:28.998
very weird bartender,
and she said that the Playhouse

10:29.033 --> 10:31.791
is like five minutes away, so let's go.
Let's go now.

10:31.826 --> 10:33.436
Actually, we're probably gonna
finish our drinks because...

10:33.470 --> 10:35.672
- No, we gotta move now.
- I'm working things out with Molly.

10:35.706 --> 10:37.607
That's great,
but we should get going for reasons

10:37.641 --> 10:39.742
- that I'm gonna explain later.
- Pardon me, gentlemen.

10:39.777 --> 10:42.245
Oh! OK, well, hmmm...
that's one of them.

10:42.279 --> 10:44.914
Don't let us interrupt the good times.

10:44.948 --> 10:48.451
- A roving gang.
- Yes, it turns out there are roving gangs. I am so sorry.

10:48.485 --> 10:50.979
Looks like you guys are having fun,
eh, Nitro?

10:51.014 --> 10:52.321
Oh yeah, Doyt.

10:52.946 --> 10:55.491
Looks like everyone's
blowing off some steam.

10:55.526 --> 10:59.095
Yeah. Uh, well, the three of us were
actually just on our way out, so...

10:59.129 --> 11:00.997
Oh yeah?
Yeah, you got plans with friends?

11:01.031 --> 11:03.933
That's nice. You're gonna go
goof around, have a laugh?

11:03.967 --> 11:05.768
- Something like that.
- Yes, sort of.

11:05.803 --> 11:07.603
Well, that's nice. I like that.

11:07.638 --> 11:09.939
- Love to laugh.
- Hmm!

11:09.973 --> 11:12.475
Nitro, tell 'em a joke.

11:12.509 --> 11:15.144
Just so happens I have a
joke here in my pocket.

11:18.215 --> 11:21.017
- (Bleep) you!
- OK.

11:21.051 --> 11:23.453
I got a joke too. Knock, knock.

11:23.487 --> 11:25.922
- Who's there?
- Boom.

11:27.825 --> 11:30.126
It's the middle finger again.
Boom, it's gone.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.061
OK.

11:32.096 --> 11:35.844
Obviously, it's very clear
that we all love jokes.

11:35.879 --> 11:38.935
Except for when those jokes

11:38.969 --> 11:42.338
happen to be at the expense...

11:42.372 --> 11:44.732
of my good friend Douglas.

11:45.843 --> 11:48.311
Oh, hell...

11:50.625 --> 11:53.382
You see, Douglas has a condition.
He's asthmatic,

11:53.417 --> 11:55.384
and he's also got some
throat things that makes it

11:55.419 --> 11:58.554
very noisy when he breathes.
It's no biggie,

11:58.589 --> 12:01.424
but he's just very
self-conscious about it.

12:01.458 --> 12:03.893
Which is why it pained me to learn

12:03.927 --> 12:06.829
that some out-of-towners
were making little comments.

12:07.595 --> 12:10.233
Douglas, are these
the people that mocked you?

12:14.242 --> 12:15.171
Yeah.

12:15.205 --> 12:17.039
It's just his voice.

12:17.074 --> 12:19.709
That's how he talks. Listen, Douglas,

12:19.743 --> 12:23.880
we are so, so sorry
for any hurt we caused you.

12:24.665 --> 12:26.315
- Maybe we could buy you a drink...
- A drink?!

12:26.350 --> 12:28.885
You think you can come
into our territory,

12:28.919 --> 12:30.887
Vesties territory,

12:30.921 --> 12:34.123
and buy your way out
of this with a drink?

12:34.158 --> 12:36.058
You want me to waste these guys, Doyt?

12:36.093 --> 12:38.661
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Doyt, please,

12:38.695 --> 12:41.257
the three of us are actually quite nice
if you just get to know us.

12:41.292 --> 12:43.800
- What did you just call me?
- I called you Doyt. Is Doyt...

12:43.834 --> 12:47.136
- Is your name not Doyt?
- My name is Dirt.

12:48.605 --> 12:50.540
Are you making fun

12:50.574 --> 12:53.276
of my friend Nitro's
speech impediment now?

12:54.745 --> 12:56.045
Nooo. No.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.114
- Mark is not.
- Oh, boy,

12:58.148 --> 13:01.584
you really like making fun of
other people's problems, don't you?

13:01.618 --> 13:05.411
That is not true at all. That's two
coincidences in quick succession.

13:05.446 --> 13:06.923
Maybe I can give you a little condition

13:06.957 --> 13:11.894
that we can all laugh at.
A little knife-itis.

13:13.061 --> 13:14.288
Wait. Wait.

13:14.323 --> 13:16.232
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:16.266 --> 13:20.102
Let him go now!
Nobody hurts my friends in my bar!

13:20.137 --> 13:22.438
Oh, my God!
She's lifting him by his goddamn neck!

13:22.472 --> 13:25.341
Let's go, guys! Thank you, scary lady!

13:27.010 --> 13:30.313
Standing up for your friends,
that something I can respect.

13:30.347 --> 13:33.816
Alright, gang... let's get 'em outside!

13:33.851 --> 13:36.627
She doesn't have jurisdiction
over the streets.

13:36.662 --> 13:38.765
- Let's go, whoo!
- Let's go!

13:44.442 --> 13:46.076
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

13:48.446 --> 13:50.414
OK. OK. Slow down for a second.
I feel like I'm gonna...

13:50.955 --> 13:52.349
- Did we lose 'em?
- Hello?

13:52.383 --> 13:54.952
- No.
- OK, over here.

13:54.986 --> 13:57.020
Over here. Over here.

13:57.055 --> 13:59.256
Hey! I can see you over there!

14:00.825 --> 14:04.561
Oh, I'm a police officer by the way.

14:04.595 --> 14:06.763
Sir, you are a real lifesaver.

14:06.798 --> 14:08.765
I mean, I knew we were gonna be OK,
but you are

14:08.800 --> 14:11.435
- concrete evidence of that.
- Oh, no sweat.

14:11.469 --> 14:14.471
You know, I'm mostly here just to stop
people from breaking into parked cars.

14:14.505 --> 14:17.941
So I had my eye on you.
But, well, then you guys looked

14:17.976 --> 14:20.711
like you needed some help,
so I thought, you know, help you.

14:20.745 --> 14:22.479
Yeah, we were tracking all that, thanks.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.581
- So where are you all headed?
- Back to the tourist zone

14:24.615 --> 14:26.950
- and then as far away from the town as possible.
- Or, or...

14:26.985 --> 14:29.920
how far are we from the Playhouse, sir?

14:29.954 --> 14:32.656
Mark, if we don't head back
to the tourist zone right now,

14:32.690 --> 14:35.959
- I will murder you myself.
- Molly, you might want to think

14:35.994 --> 14:38.295
twice about threatening me in
front of an officer of the law.

14:38.329 --> 14:40.464
Oh, I don't mind, I'm pretty easygoing.

14:40.498 --> 14:42.399
But, you know,
if you're looking for the Playhouse,

14:42.433 --> 14:44.401
I have some great news for you.
You're already there.

14:45.422 --> 14:46.303
What? What do you mean?

14:46.337 --> 14:48.472
This is the Playhouse's parking garage.

14:48.506 --> 14:50.440
Look, there's an elevator
right over there.

14:50.475 --> 14:51.683
It takes you up to the foyer.

14:51.743 --> 14:54.945
Oh, my goodness! Would you look at that!

14:54.979 --> 14:56.880
I told you this city was alright.

14:57.857 --> 14:58.782
Ohhh...

14:58.816 --> 15:01.818
- Hello again.
- OK, never mind.

15:01.853 --> 15:03.820
The city is garbage.
Get in the car! Get in the car!

15:03.855 --> 15:06.223
- OK!
- Oh no! You three pissed off

15:06.257 --> 15:08.291
- the Vesties?!
- Yes, we did! So get in the car

15:08.326 --> 15:10.994
- right now, please!
- Oh no. The Vesties run this area.

15:11.029 --> 15:12.896
I'm sorry, but you're on your own.

15:12.930 --> 15:15.098
What the hell are you talking about?!
Get in the car!

15:15.133 --> 15:16.731
Please don't judge the entire
Charlottetown police service

15:16.835 --> 15:19.436
based on my actions. I'm a coward!

15:19.470 --> 15:23.874
Destroy the car! Do what you
want to them! Just let me live!

15:23.908 --> 15:26.209
That is a very bad police officer.

15:28.079 --> 15:30.847
OK. Um, what... what do we do here?

15:30.882 --> 15:32.849
- Do we... do we run?
- We're surrounded,

15:32.884 --> 15:35.452
- we can't run.
- I'm done running.

15:35.486 --> 15:37.054
What do you mean, you're done running?

15:37.088 --> 15:39.056
We hunters have a saying,

15:39.090 --> 15:41.191
"Hunt or be hunted."

15:41.225 --> 15:44.361
I'm not gonna let this
big city hunt me anymore.

15:44.395 --> 15:46.363
It's time to hunt back.

15:46.397 --> 15:48.465
"It's time to hunt back"?

15:48.499 --> 15:50.987
Maybe we should talk to them.
This is probably a talking situation.

15:51.022 --> 15:55.972
Guys like that only understand
one language... violence.

15:57.542 --> 15:59.018
Fortunately...

16:00.411 --> 16:03.613
...I'm bilingual.

16:03.648 --> 16:05.916
- Holy smokes!
- That was awesome!

16:05.950 --> 16:07.884
Yeah, that was really well put.

16:10.788 --> 16:13.857
Remember us? Dirt, Nitro,

16:13.891 --> 16:16.560
bunch of other gang members
who have minor defects

16:16.594 --> 16:18.562
I'm sure you'd love to point out.

16:20.798 --> 16:23.100
- My gosh!
- OK.

16:23.134 --> 16:25.368
OK, that's...
that's how she's gonna do it.

16:25.403 --> 16:28.171
She's just gonna beat the
(Bleep) out of everyone.

16:31.275 --> 16:33.910
- We should probably get out there.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:33.945 --> 16:35.912
It's just...
I feel like she's got training.

16:35.947 --> 16:37.848
Absolutely. Yeah, she does.

16:37.882 --> 16:39.749
- She's demonstrating that.
- We don't.

16:39.784 --> 16:42.052
- We, a hundred percent, do not.
- Definitely do not.

16:42.086 --> 16:44.121
OK, big guy's coming in! The big boy!

16:44.155 --> 16:47.390
We're clearly saying she
has got a handle on this.

16:47.425 --> 16:49.960
For her, she's like,
"They're not even bothering to

16:49.994 --> 16:52.462
leave the car, that's how much
confidence they have in me."

16:52.497 --> 16:54.284
- Yeah.
- "And that makes me feel good,

16:54.285 --> 16:55.685
and that makes me fight better."

16:59.370 --> 17:01.271
For some reason,
they're attacking her one at a time,

17:01.305 --> 17:02.823
and she seems to be able to handle that.

17:02.907 --> 17:06.742
Yeah. It's honorable of them, I guess.

17:06.777 --> 17:08.878
Or they just...
they just don't have strategy.

17:08.913 --> 17:10.914
It's their weakness at the top.

17:10.948 --> 17:14.550
- Did I say, "One at a time"? Everybody at once!
- Come on!

17:14.585 --> 17:16.619
I could do it,
but I have the neck thing.

17:16.654 --> 17:18.121
- Let's go!
- Come on!

17:18.156 --> 17:20.423
- Oh, they got her.
- Oh, they got her.

17:20.458 --> 17:22.791
- They did get her.
- Oh! Ugh!

17:24.328 --> 17:26.930
Well, that was pretty good,
but I'm afraid that you are...

17:26.964 --> 17:29.466
GODDAMN IT! OUCH!

17:29.500 --> 17:31.854
Oh, my God! Do you have her yet?!

17:31.855 --> 17:34.946
Get her out of here!
Hold her by her fists!

17:35.740 --> 17:37.674
Jeez!

17:37.708 --> 17:40.277
Alright, fellas, you can come out now.

17:40.311 --> 17:42.679
Here they come for us. That's good.

17:42.713 --> 17:45.148
Should we try and fight them?
No. Don't know why I said that.

17:45.183 --> 17:47.484
Yes, why did you even say that?
That's insane.

17:47.518 --> 17:49.386
- We're coming, we're coming.
- We're coming, OK.

17:49.420 --> 17:51.288
We're good, we're good, we're good.
Or you can grab us.

17:51.322 --> 17:54.691
You guys were so brave in there.
You were brave.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.593
You two were brave. Just equal.

17:56.627 --> 17:58.929
Everybody, so brave.

17:58.963 --> 18:01.364
Haha! But I'm sorry

18:01.399 --> 18:03.366
because this ends right now.

18:03.401 --> 18:06.369
Wait! Dirt, let her go.

18:06.404 --> 18:08.138
Andy, what the hell are you doing?

18:08.172 --> 18:10.173
You're right, Mark, I'm a coward,

18:10.208 --> 18:12.175
but like Molly said, "I'm done running."

18:12.210 --> 18:14.211
It's time to do what's right.

18:14.245 --> 18:16.880
Molly, I love you.

18:16.914 --> 18:19.082
- Oh, my God!
- Or I really like you.

18:19.116 --> 18:21.218
Or I would like to get to know you.

18:21.252 --> 18:22.593
We're probably gonna die tonight;

18:22.621 --> 18:25.822
before we do,
I wanna show you how I feel.

18:25.856 --> 18:28.458
So, Dirt...

18:29.894 --> 18:33.396
...let's do this man to man.
Throw down your knife

18:33.431 --> 18:35.498
and put up your fists,

18:35.533 --> 18:39.803
so I can suck your ass
in front of your friends.

18:44.075 --> 18:48.979
I'm sorry, did you just say
you were gonna suck my ass?

18:49.647 --> 18:51.982
What? No. What? When?

18:52.016 --> 18:55.552
You just said you were gonna suck
my ass in front of my friends.

18:55.586 --> 18:57.220
No, I didn't, I didn't. I said kick.

18:57.255 --> 19:00.123
You definitely just said suck.
"I'm gonna suck your ass

19:00.157 --> 19:01.461
in front of your friends."

19:02.126 --> 19:04.794
- Who heard that?
- That's what I heard.

19:04.829 --> 19:06.429
- Did I... did I say that?
- Yeah.

19:06.464 --> 19:08.798
You misspoke. You misspoke,

19:08.833 --> 19:10.834
- and you're a loser.
- Enough!

19:13.771 --> 19:15.405
Laverne!

19:15.439 --> 19:18.208
You will leave these three alone.

19:18.242 --> 19:21.344
You will return to the place
from whence you came

19:21.379 --> 19:23.813
and bother strangers no more.

19:23.848 --> 19:26.049
From this day forward,

19:26.083 --> 19:30.253
compassion, not violence,
shall guide you.

19:32.757 --> 19:35.058
Well, I don't know what that was, but...

19:35.092 --> 19:39.562
you're Laverne, the Incredibilist,
right? Are you not him? You're him.

19:39.597 --> 19:41.765
Oh, my God! One time, I saw you

19:41.799 --> 19:43.967
hypnotize these two strangers
into thinking they crapped

19:44.001 --> 19:45.530
each other's pants.

19:46.170 --> 19:49.072
- Thank you. I like that bit a lot.
- I may be out of line

19:49.106 --> 19:51.141
in asking this, Mr. Laverne, but, ahem,

19:51.175 --> 19:53.143
I would very much like your autograph.

19:53.177 --> 19:56.079
- Of course. Do you have a pen?
- Ooh, um...

19:56.113 --> 19:58.515
Uh-oh! Yes, it appears...

20:00.685 --> 20:01.674
...you do.

20:02.353 --> 20:03.953
Whaa...

20:03.988 --> 20:07.424
There you go. One for you.

20:07.458 --> 20:10.627
And one for you!

20:10.661 --> 20:13.163
- Thank you, Laverne.
- Always happy to meet the fans.

20:13.197 --> 20:16.733
- I feel like a little kid again, I really do. Thank you!
- Bye, Laverne!

20:18.230 --> 20:23.373
Now, may I interest you three in a
performance that audiences seldom forget?

20:25.209 --> 20:27.310
Oh! Oh! And then when Andy was on stage,

20:27.345 --> 20:29.746
and he kept saying, "I made a stinky."

20:29.780 --> 20:31.735
I thought I was gonna die.

20:32.550 --> 20:35.852
- That was amazing!
- You know, it is not funny

20:35.886 --> 20:37.854
to make people do things
against their will.

20:37.888 --> 20:39.289
And you know what?
If I see Laverne again...

20:39.323 --> 20:42.025
What? You'll threaten to suck his ass?

20:42.059 --> 20:44.561
Oh, my God!
I forgot that was tonight too.

20:45.598 --> 20:48.865
"Put up your fists or I'll suck your ass
in front of your friends!"

20:48.899 --> 20:51.368
- It's right! That's right!
- OK, new rule:

20:51.402 --> 20:52.652
no talking 'til we get home.

20:53.604 --> 20:57.440
Oh, my God!
Oh, you have had quite a night, Andy.

20:57.475 --> 21:00.477
Hey, Molly, remember
when Andy said he loved you?

21:00.511 --> 21:02.645
Yeah. What do you love about me, Andy?

21:02.680 --> 21:04.581
You barely know me.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.985
