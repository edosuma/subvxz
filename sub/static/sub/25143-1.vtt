00:42.640 --> 00:43.809
Can I try?

00:44.844 --> 00:46.746
Go ahead.

00:49.715 --> 00:51.714
Get the flame right on the wick.

00:51.716 --> 00:54.686
Careful.
OK, stand back.

01:05.798 --> 01:07.067
Hey.

01:10.436 --> 01:12.136
How's it going?

01:12.138 --> 01:16.276
It's going.
Just out taking a walk.

01:19.444 --> 01:21.547
Is it cool if I join you?

01:23.182 --> 01:24.847
Yeah.

01:24.849 --> 01:28.253
<i>I was young... once.</i>

01:30.923 --> 01:32.656
Be back by eight, yeah?

01:32.658 --> 01:36.826
Come on, Dad.
Let's go.

01:36.828 --> 01:39.729
<i>When we're young,
we think we're invincible.</i>

01:41.933 --> 01:45.605
<i>But then life
teaches you otherwise.</i>

01:52.210 --> 01:56.246
<i>I was 16-years-old
the summer I met Grace Turner.</i>

02:03.254 --> 02:06.558
Hey. What are you doing?

02:07.859 --> 02:10.330
I'm throwing this bridge
in the river.

02:19.604 --> 02:24.543
Here.
Go ahead. Toss it over.

02:27.212 --> 02:28.715
OK.

02:35.753 --> 02:37.754
Doesn't this upset the fish?

02:37.756 --> 02:38.858
No.

02:40.258 --> 02:42.326
They just move and then

02:42.328 --> 02:44.460
forget why they even moved
in the first place.

02:44.462 --> 02:48.565
Whoa.
I'd hate to live like that.

02:48.567 --> 02:50.336
Like what?

02:51.437 --> 02:54.941
Like, not remembering things.

02:57.008 --> 02:59.411
Think about everything
you'd lose.

03:00.979 --> 03:03.549
All the great memories
you wouldn't have.

03:07.453 --> 03:10.419
Well, I guess
I better get going.

03:10.421 --> 03:12.258
OK.

03:18.830 --> 03:23.335
What would you say if I told you
you were gonna be my first love?

03:24.402 --> 03:26.036
What would you say to that?

03:26.038 --> 03:29.373
Um... I don't know what I'd say.

03:29.375 --> 03:35.581
OK. Think about it,
and get back to me when you do.

03:41.854 --> 03:44.757
<i>I had no idea what I was doing.</i>

03:50.663 --> 03:53.697
<i>Our town was trying
to kill us with boredom.</i>

03:53.699 --> 03:56.600
<i>So Hunter insisted
this July 4th would be</i>

03:56.602 --> 04:00.637
<i>the greatest act of rebellion since 1776.</i>

04:00.639 --> 04:04.441
<i>Timmy was more concerned with the
practical matters of manhood.</i>

04:04.443 --> 04:08.512
<i>The three of us were in a race to see
who could get to third base first.</i>

04:08.514 --> 04:10.647
So...,
what are you...

04:10.649 --> 04:12.816
what are you doin' tonight?

04:12.818 --> 04:15.619
<i>None of us wanted to lose.</i>

04:42.348 --> 04:44.917
You know,
she totally wants you, man.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.483
I don't know.

04:47.485 --> 04:49.519
What do you mean
you don't know?

04:49.521 --> 04:52.324
She told you for Christ's sake.

04:53.057 --> 04:54.957
I guess.

04:54.959 --> 04:56.860
Give me that.

04:56.862 --> 05:00.863
No guessing, man, alright?
She wants it bad.

05:00.865 --> 05:03.800
Dude, if I was you,
I'd be getting on that shit.

05:03.802 --> 05:05.702
- Mmm.
- I mean, you gotta make sure

05:05.704 --> 05:08.671
she knows that you're the one
calling the shots, you know.

05:08.673 --> 05:12.007
I mean, otherwise we might as
well just forget the whole thing.

05:12.009 --> 05:14.577
She probably just wants you
for your body anyway.

05:15.514 --> 05:16.512
Yeah, probably.

05:16.514 --> 05:17.848
- Shut up, Tim.
- Ohh!

05:17.850 --> 05:19.585
Come on, guys,
let's get outta here.

05:23.588 --> 05:24.954
You guys want any more of this?

05:24.956 --> 05:26.456
- I'm good.
- Nope.

05:26.458 --> 05:28.425
Naw? Alright,
I'm gonna chuck it.

05:28.427 --> 05:29.726
- Do it.
- Chuck it.

05:29.728 --> 05:30.961
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.695
- Here we go!
- Chuck, chuck, chuck!

05:32.697 --> 05:33.964
Kaboom!

05:36.701 --> 05:39.872
And the crowd goes wild!

05:50.882 --> 05:52.418
Conrad?

05:55.987 --> 05:59.856
<i>My father
left us five years before,</i>

05:59.858 --> 06:02.961
<i>and home hadn't
been the same since.</i>

06:05.062 --> 06:06.663
<i>To fill the void,</i>

06:06.665 --> 06:08.764
<i>my mom had latched
on to me so tight</i>

06:08.766 --> 06:10.536
<i>I could barely breathe.</i>

06:12.004 --> 06:15.971
<i>So, today, things were
gonna be different,</i>

06:15.973 --> 06:19.608
<i>I had an invitation
I couldn't refuse.</i>

06:19.610 --> 06:23.915
<i>One way or another
I was gonna make my move.</i>

07:00.952 --> 07:06.191
Well, look who it is.
Come on. We're all out back.

07:17.769 --> 07:19.838
How 'bout another burger,
Conrad?

07:21.607 --> 07:23.240
Uh, I'm OK.

07:23.242 --> 07:26.913
C'mon, you need to put some more
meat on those bones of yours.

07:29.014 --> 07:30.981
OK, you talked me into it.

07:30.983 --> 07:32.485
There you go.

07:34.185 --> 07:35.651
Eric, could you get me a beer?

07:35.653 --> 07:37.187
Sure thing, Dad.

07:37.189 --> 07:39.522
It's nice of you
to join us, Connie.

07:39.524 --> 07:41.690
Your family
didn't have any plans?

07:41.692 --> 07:45.228
Uh, well, my mom,
she's outta town,

07:45.230 --> 07:47.697
she's, uh,
out on business right now.

07:47.699 --> 07:49.031
Oh, a working woman, huh?

07:49.033 --> 07:50.966
See, honey,
I told you they existed.

07:50.968 --> 07:53.536
That must be so hard.

07:53.538 --> 07:55.839
Dad, tell her to stop.

07:55.841 --> 07:57.640
How 'bout your father,
what does he do?

07:57.642 --> 07:59.909
Oh.

07:59.911 --> 08:01.211
Problem there, Connie?

08:01.213 --> 08:02.978
Eric, just shut it.

08:02.980 --> 08:05.315
See? Always with the attitude.

08:05.317 --> 08:08.851
Be careful, man, you're gonna have
a hard time keeping her in line.

08:08.853 --> 08:10.586
Dad, tell him to stop.

08:10.588 --> 08:13.656
- Gracie, relax.
- He's trying to embarrass me.

08:13.658 --> 08:15.224
You do that on your own.

08:15.226 --> 08:17.260
Stop being such
a shithead, Eric.

08:17.262 --> 08:19.564
Watch the language.

08:21.165 --> 08:23.134
Oh, my God!

08:25.803 --> 08:28.103
Eric, I think you know better.

08:28.105 --> 08:29.772
C'mon,
I was just jokin' with her.

08:29.774 --> 08:31.176
Right.

08:45.023 --> 08:46.759
Hey, Connie!

08:49.595 --> 08:53.063
Uh, listen, man,
you like my sister, don't ya?

08:53.065 --> 08:55.098
Yeah, well, I mean...

08:55.100 --> 08:56.967
It's cool, man, don't sweat it.

08:56.969 --> 08:58.001
OK.

08:58.003 --> 09:00.036
Play it cool, OK,

09:00.038 --> 09:01.871
don't show her
you're too interested.

09:01.873 --> 09:03.772
But, don't hold back
too much either.

09:03.774 --> 09:05.877
Yeah, I guess.

09:06.979 --> 09:08.945
Gotta make the first move, man.

09:08.947 --> 09:11.348
- Be aggressive.
- Cool.

09:11.350 --> 09:14.052
But not too aggressive, alright,
she's still my little sister.

09:15.687 --> 09:17.119
Yeah.

09:17.121 --> 09:20.225
- Good luck, buddy.
- You too, man.

09:25.397 --> 09:27.830
Hey.

09:27.832 --> 09:32.672
I'm really sorry about
my family. They're so annoying.

09:34.038 --> 09:35.972
They seem pretty great to me.

09:35.974 --> 09:39.074
Well, looks
can be deceiving right?

09:39.076 --> 09:40.913
Hm.

09:44.249 --> 09:48.984
So, you coming to the fireworks
with us tonight, or what?

09:48.986 --> 09:52.756
Uh, well, I kinda told the guys
I'd hang out with them tonight.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.425
Oh.

09:55.427 --> 09:57.863
Let's hope I survive it
alone then.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.937
The winds blowing nice today.

10:06.171 --> 10:07.840
Yeah.

10:10.107 --> 10:14.677
Hey, hey, hey.
You two hooking up or what?

10:14.679 --> 10:16.780
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Grace.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.815
Hey, Timmy.
Hey, Hunter.

10:18.817 --> 10:20.783
You, uh, teachin' our boy
the ways of the world?

10:20.785 --> 10:22.852
- Dude, shut up.
- Aw, look at that,

10:22.854 --> 10:24.186
defending his girl, how sweet.

10:24.188 --> 10:27.022
I'm sorry, Grace.

10:27.024 --> 10:28.757
Hey, hey, hey, did you
just say sorry to her, man?

10:28.759 --> 10:30.392
Cause, you were supposed to
meet up with us

10:30.394 --> 10:31.864
like three hours ago.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.363
It's cool, Conrad,

10:34.365 --> 10:37.199
if you wanna hang out with a
buncha children go right ahead.

10:37.201 --> 10:41.036
- Ohh! Burn!
- Oh, God! How am I gonna recover from that one?

10:41.038 --> 10:44.940
- It hurts!
- Hunter, how am I gonna recover from that?

10:44.942 --> 10:47.076
See you later?

10:47.078 --> 10:48.780
OK.

10:50.347 --> 10:51.815
Gentlemen.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.917
- Mmm. How ladylike.
- Ohh, yes. Bye.

10:54.919 --> 10:57.320
- Bye, Grace.
- Have a wonderful day.

10:57.322 --> 10:59.254
You got yourself
a keeper there, Conrad.

10:59.256 --> 11:00.924
Dude, what the hell are you doing?

11:00.926 --> 11:02.459
Hey, calm down, man.

11:02.461 --> 11:04.326
Why'd you have to do that?
You're embarrassing me...

11:04.328 --> 11:06.095
What are you talking about?

11:06.097 --> 11:08.765
Dude, I don't even know
where his hands have been.

11:08.767 --> 11:10.032
Where they been, Connie?

11:10.034 --> 11:12.001
Obviously not on Grace.

11:12.003 --> 11:17.339
Ohh. You hear that, Con?
Obviously not on Grace.

11:17.341 --> 11:19.879
That hurt.
That hurt.

11:24.416 --> 11:27.316
So, you'd, uh,
get a little kiss?

11:27.318 --> 11:29.752
No, you totally blew the moment,
dude.

11:29.754 --> 11:31.353
- I was going to.
- Blew the moment?

11:31.355 --> 11:33.022
- Yeah.
- Aw, did you hear this, kid?

11:33.024 --> 11:34.390
Yeah, I'm hearing it.

11:34.392 --> 11:36.825
Stop with the angry
game, Con, alright?

11:36.827 --> 11:38.261
You ditched us for her.

11:38.263 --> 11:40.763
I was just leaving to come find
you guys, I swear.

11:40.765 --> 11:45.435
Ohh, OK, well, looked like you were just
trying to find something, if you ask me.

11:45.437 --> 11:47.837
Oh, man,
finding something for sure.

11:47.839 --> 11:49.772
Should we even include
him in tonight's plans, Tim?

11:49.774 --> 11:52.908
See, uh, I don't know.
I just don't know.

11:52.910 --> 11:55.545
- I don't know either, man.
- Just tell me what's goin' on.

11:55.547 --> 11:58.381
Alright, we got wheels.

11:58.383 --> 12:02.986
My Granddad's taking the night off, so
we'll snag his truck. He won't even know.

12:02.988 --> 12:04.787
You can't drive.

12:04.789 --> 12:08.157
Dude, I got my permit alright,
don't be a pussy.

12:08.159 --> 12:11.261
Why can't we just head over to the
fireworks like everybody else?

12:11.263 --> 12:13.796
Lame. Lame!

12:13.798 --> 12:16.031
Oh, we're doing it
with or without you, Con.

12:16.033 --> 12:18.300
I mean, you wanna ditch us
again, go for it.

12:18.302 --> 12:22.171
- C'mon, man.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, it's cool, man. Have fun, buddy.

12:22.173 --> 12:24.840
See you later.

12:24.842 --> 12:26.511
Peace.

12:44.461 --> 12:48.000
Alright, Tim, open the trunk
and take the wheel, alright?

12:51.903 --> 12:53.372
Go, go!

12:54.339 --> 12:56.375
Open it man, open it.

13:01.111 --> 13:02.845
Let's go, let's go.

13:02.847 --> 13:05.317
Look what I got.

13:20.631 --> 13:22.167
Let's go, c'mon.

13:47.292 --> 13:50.863
- Oh, shit let's go.
- Hunter, let's go. C'mon, c'mon.

13:52.496 --> 13:55.131
Go, go, go, go, go.

13:55.133 --> 13:58.001
Damn, dude. You need to stop
pulling that shit.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.036
Jesus, you were loving it
like five seconds ago.

14:00.038 --> 14:01.503
Yeah, what's your deal, man?

14:01.505 --> 14:03.373
I mean, ever since
you started getting pussy,

14:03.375 --> 14:04.641
you've turned into a pussy.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.475
Man's got a point.

14:06.477 --> 14:08.478
You're just jealous 'cause
I'm actually getting some.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.915
Ah, if you're such a man,
then why don't you prove it?

14:11.917 --> 14:13.416
I'm not proving shit to you.

14:13.418 --> 14:15.584
Oh, wow, what do you think, Tim?

14:15.586 --> 14:19.555
Think he'd prove something to
shitface Grace if she asked him to?

14:19.557 --> 14:21.690
I bet he would.

14:21.692 --> 14:24.127
Yeah, I think so, too.

14:24.129 --> 14:28.430
No real man chooses some chick
over his best buds.

14:33.071 --> 14:35.074
Hey, Tim,
make a left right here.

14:40.345 --> 14:42.314
Fourth house on the right.

14:44.282 --> 14:46.285
Dude, you don't have the balls.

15:21.285 --> 15:24.020
What the hell? Hey!

15:24.022 --> 15:26.025
Eat a dick, bitch!

15:28.293 --> 15:29.658
Did you see the look on his face?

15:29.660 --> 15:31.194
What the hell, Hunter,
he saw me!

15:31.196 --> 15:33.563
Jeez, man, whatever,
OK, it's dark.

15:33.565 --> 15:36.766
He doesn't have a clue. Besides it's
a stupid plant, alright, who cares?

15:38.302 --> 15:39.634
Oh, shit!

15:39.636 --> 15:41.205
Shit.

15:43.541 --> 15:46.041
Alright, chill out, you guys.
Make a right up ahead,

15:46.043 --> 15:48.112
we're gonna lose him
on the outskirts.

15:50.648 --> 15:53.116
Connie, you need to throw that
goddamn plant out the window.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.286
No.

15:56.721 --> 15:59.287
Hunter, what are you doing?

15:59.289 --> 16:01.223
- Hey, don't, hey!
- That's the point, man.

16:01.225 --> 16:03.328
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Calm down.

16:04.428 --> 16:06.230
I can't get rid of him!

16:12.202 --> 16:13.504
Got it.

16:16.274 --> 16:17.710
Hey, look out!

16:54.379 --> 16:56.281
Is he OK?

16:59.451 --> 17:02.321
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Shut up, Tim.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.028
Oh, my God.

17:20.738 --> 17:22.708
He's still breathing.

17:33.284 --> 17:34.883
- Let's get the hell outta here.
- What?

17:34.885 --> 17:38.222
It's a public road, Conrad.

17:39.857 --> 17:42.391
Someone's gonna
drive by any second,

17:42.393 --> 17:44.360
and when they do,
they'll get help.

17:44.362 --> 17:46.565
And we need to
get the hell outta here.

17:48.866 --> 17:52.235
I'm not gonna leave him there to die out
there... we're not gonna leave him.

17:52.237 --> 17:56.139
He's not gonna die, godammit.

17:56.141 --> 18:00.312
Look, he's breathing,
Conrad, OK?

18:06.416 --> 18:08.386
Alright, we take a vote, OK?

18:09.721 --> 18:12.755
Hunter, we're not gonna
leave him here!

18:12.757 --> 18:14.359
I say we leave.

18:16.426 --> 18:18.463
We're not gonna leave him.

18:20.230 --> 18:22.198
What's it gonna be, Timmy?

18:22.200 --> 18:25.269
God.

18:27.905 --> 18:29.807
You need to vote, Tim.

18:37.248 --> 18:39.715
Look, I need you to trust me
here, Conrad, alright?

18:39.717 --> 18:43.322
Everything is gonna be fine.

18:45.522 --> 18:47.158
C'mon.

18:58.336 --> 18:59.904
Swear to God, I'll leave you.

20:00.265 --> 20:02.467
Hey, I'll take care
of the ornaments, alright?

21:50.040 --> 21:51.742
Conrad?

21:53.744 --> 21:55.978
So you did come home last night?

21:55.980 --> 21:58.814
Yeah, I... I got tied up
with Hunter and Timmy.

21:58.816 --> 22:02.418
Tied up? You ran off
when we had a whole day planned.

22:02.420 --> 22:05.791
Mom. I'm sorry. I didn't...

22:06.691 --> 22:08.393
Didn't what?

22:12.864 --> 22:14.865
Come eat breakfast.

22:44.694 --> 22:46.597
What's that?

22:47.498 --> 22:48.631
What's what?

22:48.633 --> 22:52.066
On your shirt? Is that blood?

22:56.941 --> 22:59.377
Go on, get it.

23:07.050 --> 23:08.450
Hello?

23:11.489 --> 23:12.723
Ms. Williams.

23:18.128 --> 23:22.998
Morning, Rachel.
This is an early surprise.

23:26.903 --> 23:28.740
Oh, my God.

23:34.178 --> 23:36.982
I appreciate you
telling me first.

23:38.548 --> 23:41.452
This is terrible,
they must be a mess.

23:42.819 --> 23:45.523
Call me if you hear
anything more, will you?

23:46.257 --> 23:47.826
Bye-bye to you too.

24:17.255 --> 24:18.623
Hey.

24:21.826 --> 24:23.161
He's dead.

24:25.162 --> 24:26.965
Did you hear me, Hunter?

24:28.298 --> 24:30.699
I said he's dead.

24:30.701 --> 24:32.903
Whole town's talking about it.

24:34.238 --> 24:35.837
Well, what're we gonna do?

24:35.839 --> 24:39.141
What'd you mean?
He hit a deer.

24:39.143 --> 24:41.643
Alright, nobody needs to know
any more than that.

24:41.645 --> 24:42.878
Hunter, we shoulda
done something.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.078
And just what do you want, Con?

24:44.080 --> 24:45.713
We can't just
bring him back to life

24:45.715 --> 24:47.685
by saying a few words.

24:48.786 --> 24:50.885
What happened, happened, Connie,

24:50.887 --> 24:52.587
and there ain't
no changing that.

24:52.589 --> 24:54.155
Would you stop
with the damn ball?

24:54.157 --> 24:55.724
You know we can go on and on

24:55.726 --> 24:57.625
about what we shoulda done,

24:57.627 --> 24:59.795
but in the end we still
didn't, alright, we walked.

24:59.797 --> 25:01.830
- And that was our decision.
- That was your decision, Hunter!

25:01.832 --> 25:03.599
That was your decision.

25:03.601 --> 25:08.170
Oh, yeah, was real nice
of you to help him out.

25:08.172 --> 25:10.875
I said stop with the damn ball.

25:12.910 --> 25:15.547
Guys, guys, guys!
No, stop, stop!

25:32.262 --> 25:33.964
<i>I was furious,</i>

25:35.266 --> 25:41.673
<i>at Hunter,
at the pain, at myself.</i>

25:43.273 --> 25:45.276
<i>But I had it coming.</i>

25:46.743 --> 25:48.744
<i>Consequences,</i>

25:48.746 --> 25:51.246
<i>they don't always
hit you right away,</i>

25:51.248 --> 25:54.717
<i>but when they do,
you feel them.</i>

25:54.719 --> 25:56.153
Oh, my God!

26:09.299 --> 26:12.937
Wh... What happened to you?

26:14.337 --> 26:16.206
I'm OK.

26:22.012 --> 26:24.880
Grace... I just heard.

26:27.284 --> 26:32.254
I'm fine.
I just... I'm going for a walk.

26:32.256 --> 26:37.292
I, um, I'm stopped now,
but I was going for a walk.

26:39.363 --> 26:43.699
Stop, I'm OK. I'm fine.

26:43.701 --> 26:45.870
Jesus, you're covered in blood.

26:47.171 --> 26:49.807
Did Hunter or Timmy
give you that?

26:50.807 --> 26:53.842
Hunter.

26:53.844 --> 26:57.712
God, why do you
hang out with those dicks?

26:57.714 --> 27:00.915
- Grace, I'm really sorry...
- Conrad, I said it's fine.

27:00.917 --> 27:05.120
I mean, Jesus Christ, just shut the
hell up for like five seconds?

27:10.694 --> 27:12.161
Yeah.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.337
Thanks.

27:23.339 --> 27:25.175
No problem.

27:27.845 --> 27:31.316
C'mon. Let's get you cleaned up.

28:19.430 --> 28:21.332
Here, give me that.

28:28.239 --> 28:29.874
Come here.

28:40.151 --> 28:41.883
Where are you parents?

28:41.885 --> 28:46.057
Uh, I don't know.
Upstairs probably.

28:49.425 --> 28:52.096
I'm sorry about yesterday.

28:54.964 --> 28:56.465
About what?

28:56.467 --> 29:01.269
I was just... I was angry,

29:01.271 --> 29:04.475
and I wanted it to feel right
when it happened.

29:06.242 --> 29:08.009
I mean,
I've kissed other boys before,

29:08.011 --> 29:09.978
but with you, I don't know.

29:09.980 --> 29:14.486
I wanted it to be, like,
important, you know?

29:19.423 --> 29:24.095
Um... you lost a lotta blood.

29:25.996 --> 29:27.895
Want some juice or something?

29:27.897 --> 29:30.100
Uh, sure.

29:38.875 --> 29:42.978
- Apple or orange?
- Orange.

29:42.980 --> 29:46.614
Correct. That's a point.

29:46.616 --> 29:48.083
A point?

29:48.085 --> 29:50.521
Yeah, I'm keeping score for you.

29:51.521 --> 29:54.088
You're at three now.

29:54.090 --> 29:57.426
- What if I wanted apple?
- Well, we don't even have apple,

29:57.428 --> 29:59.864
so you definitely would have
lost a point.

30:02.900 --> 30:05.132
What are my other
two points for?

30:05.134 --> 30:10.008
Well, one is for my parents,
I think they like you.

30:10.907 --> 30:13.043
And the other one?

30:14.612 --> 30:16.848
Never mind that one.

30:25.556 --> 30:29.594
Grace, can I...
can I tell you something?

30:32.128 --> 30:34.196
Just say it.

30:38.067 --> 30:39.668
Just give me a sec.

30:45.009 --> 30:47.609
Oh, Grace, I'm sorry.

30:52.482 --> 30:54.586
Hey, listen.

30:56.487 --> 30:59.923
We heard about what happened,
and wanted to do something.

31:00.657 --> 31:02.690
This is not much, but...

31:02.692 --> 31:08.462
It's... It's, um, tuna noodle
casserole, the recipe your mom loves.

31:08.464 --> 31:11.967
- How's she doing?
- She's good.

31:11.969 --> 31:14.536
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, uh, Conrad.

31:14.538 --> 31:17.271
- Nice to meet you.
- Uh, her friend.

31:17.273 --> 31:21.709
We live across the street.
Are you OK?

31:21.711 --> 31:24.883
Yeah, oh, yeah,
I had a bloody nose earlier.

31:26.983 --> 31:29.484
I think Mr. and Mrs. Turner
are upstairs.

31:29.486 --> 31:31.119
I could tell 'em you stopped by?

31:31.121 --> 31:33.391
- That'd be great, yeah.
- I'm here, Conrad.

31:37.327 --> 31:38.896
Thank you.

31:41.632 --> 31:44.231
Um... this helps.

31:44.233 --> 31:47.702
- How's Lynn doing?
- Ah, it's gonna take some time.

31:49.138 --> 31:51.707
Conrad, maybe you should go home

31:51.709 --> 31:53.475
and get cleaned up, OK.

31:53.477 --> 31:56.311
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

31:56.313 --> 32:00.481
You need anything, I mean,
anything, don't hesitate.

32:00.483 --> 32:01.919
I mean it.

32:04.221 --> 32:05.554
Bye.

32:05.556 --> 32:06.688
Bye.

32:14.064 --> 32:17.134
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

32:50.601 --> 32:53.367
It is in the times
when confronted with death,

32:53.369 --> 32:57.405
that we are reminded how truly
precious life is.

32:57.407 --> 33:02.744
This is never more present than when a
life is taken away at such a young age.

33:02.746 --> 33:06.515
It is not always evident in the
moment as to the ways of our world,

33:06.517 --> 33:08.717
and it causes us to question,

33:08.719 --> 33:13.721
for it is through this imperfect world
of ours that we all must travel,

33:13.723 --> 33:16.624
and as Eric has done
as he leaves this earth...

33:16.626 --> 33:18.596
<i>I wasn't invited.</i>

33:21.097 --> 33:24.534
<i>But I forced myself to bear
witness to what I had done.</i>

33:52.328 --> 33:54.097
Hey, a little help over here?

34:02.472 --> 34:04.639
Thanks.

34:04.641 --> 34:07.278
Yeah, I figured
it was you up here.

34:13.217 --> 34:18.322
Man, he really did a number
on you the other day, huh?

34:19.889 --> 34:23.391
Uh, yeah, for what it's worth,
I think he's sorry.

34:23.393 --> 34:26.893
Thanks for the apology, huh.
Thanks.

34:26.896 --> 34:30.233
C'mon man. You know how he is.

34:31.768 --> 34:33.702
Man, I don't even
care about that.

34:33.704 --> 34:36.139
What are you up here for?
What do you want?

34:39.476 --> 34:41.411
I've been thinking about
Eric's family.

34:42.378 --> 34:44.547
Better get used to it.

34:46.516 --> 34:49.418
'Cause now we have to
for the rest of our lives.

34:51.855 --> 34:53.387
What if we said something,
you know?

34:53.389 --> 34:56.391
What if we... what if we
did something to fix it?

34:56.393 --> 35:00.465
Timmy, he's dead.
Can't fix that.

35:31.460 --> 35:32.526
Hello?

35:32.528 --> 35:33.628
<i>Hey.</i>

35:33.630 --> 35:35.429
Oh, hey.

35:35.431 --> 35:39.633
- <i>Can you come over?</i>
- What's going on?

35:39.635 --> 35:41.538
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

35:44.942 --> 35:46.610
Yeah.

35:49.346 --> 35:52.782
<i>It's easy to think that
life will fix your problems for you,</i>

35:54.717 --> 35:57.586
<i>somehow everything
will turn out alright.</i>

35:57.588 --> 35:58.820
Psst.

35:58.822 --> 36:01.858
Hey. Climb up.

36:03.893 --> 36:06.663
<i>That's the thing about fear,</i>

36:08.632 --> 36:11.202
<i>it can convince you
of anything.</i>

36:27.918 --> 36:30.818
C'mon. We gotta be quiet.

36:53.876 --> 36:56.279
Just watch where you step.

36:59.349 --> 37:00.985
I know it's a mess.

37:16.300 --> 37:22.539
OK... when you left
the picnic that day,

37:24.074 --> 37:26.574
you said you couldn't
stop by the fireworks.

37:26.576 --> 37:27.876
Yeah, well, I told the guys...

37:27.878 --> 37:29.580
Will you just shut up
and let me talk?

37:31.882 --> 37:35.684
I don't care that you didn't, I
just need to get this out, alright?

37:35.686 --> 37:37.418
Alright.

37:37.420 --> 37:43.657
After the picnic,
Eric and I got in a fight.

37:43.659 --> 37:46.026
I don't even know
what it was about,

37:46.028 --> 37:51.833
but... I told him
that I didn't want him to come

37:51.835 --> 37:53.802
to the fireworks.

37:55.371 --> 37:58.775
He didn't come because of me,
Conrad.

38:01.644 --> 38:05.650
If I hadn't... he wouldn't...

38:09.619 --> 38:11.956
It's not your fault, Grace.

38:15.726 --> 38:17.561
It's not your fault.

39:24.760 --> 39:27.864
Sorry.... Um...

39:35.871 --> 39:38.442
Wha... Come here.

39:53.523 --> 39:55.693
- Sleep with me?
- What?

39:56.992 --> 39:59.760
Don't be stupid,
just sleep next to me.

39:59.762 --> 40:02.031
Just for a little while.

40:04.601 --> 40:06.670
What about your parents?

40:08.170 --> 40:10.104
It's just that...

40:10.106 --> 40:13.611
I haven't been able
to sleep for days, and...

40:15.177 --> 40:16.980
I think it would help.

40:20.083 --> 40:21.818
OK.

41:35.592 --> 41:36.824
Gracie?

41:36.826 --> 41:40.231
Yeah, Mom,
just getting the paper.

41:44.067 --> 41:46.237
- Bye.
- Bye.

42:06.722 --> 42:08.759
<i>Suddenly, it struck me...</i>

42:10.659 --> 42:17.067
<i>one day... Grace will be older
than her older brother,</i>

42:19.668 --> 42:24.841
<i>she would grow up,
follow her dreams...</i>

42:26.175 --> 42:28.645
<i>but he would always be 19.</i>

42:59.175 --> 43:02.211
Hey. What're you doing?

43:05.114 --> 43:06.983
Eric was gonna...

43:09.753 --> 43:12.289
Gracie's out riding her bike.

43:21.697 --> 43:24.999
She's gonna be awhile.

43:27.971 --> 43:29.706
You need any help with this?

43:30.806 --> 43:33.074
No. Naw, I'm good.

43:33.076 --> 43:35.909
You sure?

43:35.911 --> 43:37.077
I got it.

43:37.079 --> 43:39.215
I'd be happy to do whatever.

43:51.327 --> 43:54.999
Alright. Knock yourself out.

43:57.434 --> 44:02.403
Um... take out the one-bys

44:02.405 --> 44:05.440
and then, uh,
take it down with the frame.

44:05.442 --> 44:07.945
- Got it.
- Alright.

44:10.980 --> 44:12.782
There you go.

44:30.833 --> 44:34.704
<i>Grief has a way of
uncovering the things we'd rather hide.</i>

44:36.306 --> 44:39.139
Hi, Connie. Come on inside,

44:39.141 --> 44:41.444
I made some lemonade
to take the heat off.

44:43.880 --> 44:49.820
<i>Sometimes it pulls us
together, sometimes it pulls us apart.</i>

44:51.221 --> 44:54.354
How's Gracie, Conrad?

44:56.358 --> 45:01.097
- Um, she seems alright.
- That's good. That's good.

45:09.371 --> 45:12.076
He was just like you, you know.

45:14.376 --> 45:18.146
Not now, I mean,
but when he was your age.

45:18.148 --> 45:21.452
Her brother was much different
with her when she was young.

45:26.489 --> 45:29.460
Don't forget
that part of you, OK?

45:33.829 --> 45:36.199
- What's going on?
- Hey, Grace.

45:37.867 --> 45:40.269
Your mom was just
giving me a glass of lemonade.

45:41.871 --> 45:44.141
There's some more in the fridge.

45:55.251 --> 45:57.851
What's your Mom like?

45:57.853 --> 45:59.854
Total freak.

45:59.856 --> 46:01.588
Without my Dad, it's like

46:01.590 --> 46:04.325
she thinks I'm his
replacement or something.

46:04.327 --> 46:08.465
I mean, all I wanna do
is just be a kid, you know.

46:10.432 --> 46:14.901
God, I just don't
get them sometimes.

46:14.903 --> 46:16.037
It's weird, right?

46:16.039 --> 46:18.039
Like, but when we were younger,

46:18.041 --> 46:19.907
they were sorta like gods.

46:19.909 --> 46:21.575
All knowing or all powerful.

46:21.577 --> 46:24.311
And had all
the answers in the world.

46:24.313 --> 46:25.612
Yeah, totally.

46:25.614 --> 46:28.983
But then, like,
you wake up one day,

46:28.985 --> 46:35.291
and you realize that your parents are
just as crazy and messed up as we are.

46:41.063 --> 46:45.067
Whoa, what is this place?

46:47.971 --> 46:49.940
C'mon, I'll show you.

46:57.480 --> 46:59.916
Whoa, cool.

47:03.152 --> 47:07.121
So, is this like
where you and the guys hang out?

47:07.123 --> 47:11.025
No, they don't even know
about this place.

47:11.027 --> 47:15.164
- Well, why not?
- I don't know.

47:16.398 --> 47:17.632
I just don't think they'd get it

47:17.634 --> 47:19.202
if I brought them here,
you know?

47:24.273 --> 47:26.275
I like you.

47:31.047 --> 47:33.481
I feel different around you
than I do with the guys.

47:33.483 --> 47:36.684
Oh...
I would hope so!

47:36.686 --> 47:40.320
Shut up.
That's not what I mean.

47:40.322 --> 47:43.359
I mean, I can be myself more.

47:44.527 --> 47:47.161
You know, say what's on my mind.

47:47.163 --> 47:50.601
Instead of
all that stupid stuff.

47:52.501 --> 47:57.304
I like how you worry about me,
and that look you give me.

47:57.306 --> 48:01.944
I don't really know what it is,
but I like it.

48:05.481 --> 48:09.653
So, do you think someone
used to live here, or what?

48:10.585 --> 48:13.954
Yeah, I guess.

48:13.956 --> 48:16.192
Something must have
happened though.

48:22.331 --> 48:26.333
- It's totally a mess now.
- Yeah.

48:26.335 --> 48:29.070
I mean,
it's not as bad as your room.

48:29.072 --> 48:31.675
Shut up.

48:37.612 --> 48:40.548
- Pick something out.
- Huh?

48:40.550 --> 48:43.987
Anything.
Anything you want, pick it out.

48:45.355 --> 48:47.257
OK.

48:48.157 --> 48:51.995
Um... here.

48:54.230 --> 48:56.262
What about this?

48:56.264 --> 48:59.099
- That?
- Yeah.

48:59.101 --> 49:00.304
Are you sure?

49:02.538 --> 49:04.541
OK, c'mon.

49:06.141 --> 49:08.044
What are we doing?

49:22.324 --> 49:23.391
Hurry, quick,
before it burns out.

49:23.393 --> 49:24.661
OK.

49:40.510 --> 49:44.147
I know it's dumb, but this stuff
has so much history.

49:46.215 --> 49:52.286
These things people used to
love, they're just objects,

49:52.288 --> 49:55.423
but they've been
through so much, you know?

49:55.425 --> 49:59.463
Sometimes people forget
that history's all still there.

50:01.530 --> 50:06.135
But it's weird like,
you burn it, and it's gone.

50:07.503 --> 50:10.106
You were the last person
in its life.

50:12.507 --> 50:15.011
...and suddenly nothing's left.

50:17.579 --> 50:19.482
Where's that all go?

50:44.273 --> 50:46.773
- Hello.
- Can I help you?

50:46.775 --> 50:51.280
I'm Katherine Stevens,
um, Conrad's Mom.

50:52.882 --> 50:54.115
Uh, come in.

50:55.650 --> 51:01.222
Um, I was so devastated when
I heard about your loss.

51:01.224 --> 51:03.257
I hope he hasn't been
too much of a fuss?

51:03.259 --> 51:06.827
Connie?
No, no, he's a real good kid.

51:06.829 --> 51:09.699
He's a pleasure
to have around here anytime.

51:10.800 --> 51:13.236
Is he here by any chance?

51:48.603 --> 51:50.673
You're beautiful.

51:52.574 --> 51:56.577
Guys aren't beautiful,
they're handsome.

51:56.579 --> 52:00.617
Beautiful, too.

52:02.918 --> 52:04.753
So are you.

52:09.324 --> 52:11.160
Wanna see something?

52:12.295 --> 52:13.459
There's more?

52:19.568 --> 52:22.869
Whoa. What happened?

52:22.871 --> 52:27.541
When I was eight, Eric and I got
into a fight about something,

52:27.543 --> 52:31.311
and he pushed me into a pole
down in our basement,

52:31.313 --> 52:33.780
and a screw on it
dug into my back.

52:33.782 --> 52:36.516
Ah, jeez. That had to hurt, huh?

52:36.518 --> 52:39.586
No...
it didn't, actually.

52:39.588 --> 52:42.690
That's the funny part,
I didn't even know it happened

52:42.692 --> 52:44.758
until he told me
that I was covered in blood.

52:44.760 --> 52:47.528
It was 13 stitches.

52:47.530 --> 52:49.932
Scar'll probably
be there forever.

52:51.233 --> 52:53.367
It's ugly though, huh?

52:53.369 --> 52:56.840
No. No, I like it.

53:02.911 --> 53:05.748
Guess we better get going, huh?

53:07.282 --> 53:08.751
Yeah.

53:15.757 --> 53:21.461
Oh. Um, hi. I'm Kathy Stevens.
Conrad's mom.

53:21.463 --> 53:23.963
Ah, my hands are filthy.
Sorry 'bout that.

53:23.965 --> 53:26.432
Uh, I see you're
building something outside.

53:26.434 --> 53:29.536
Uh, yeah, it's a new gazebo.

53:29.538 --> 53:32.943
So, Conrad told me
that you were away on business.

53:33.909 --> 53:35.778
Excuse me?

54:01.469 --> 54:03.737
What are you doing...?

54:03.739 --> 54:04.938
Would you stop?

54:04.940 --> 54:06.539
I can't believe
you went over there!

54:06.541 --> 54:08.342
I was doing something nice.

54:08.344 --> 54:10.010
Don't you think I wanna see
where my son's disappeared

54:10.012 --> 54:11.545
for the last two weeks?

54:11.547 --> 54:12.912
Don't you think I worry?!

54:12.914 --> 54:15.382
Yeah, Mom,
I'm sure you get real upset.

54:15.384 --> 54:17.483
I don't like your tone.

54:17.485 --> 54:20.387
Eh, I don't... I don't know
what's goin' on with you!

54:20.389 --> 54:23.389
- Hunter and Timmy said...
- Hunter and Timmy are assholes, Mom!

54:23.391 --> 54:25.525
- What are you two up to?
- Just hangin' out.

54:25.527 --> 54:27.594
You said it yourself,
I should watch out for her.

54:27.596 --> 54:31.331
I didn't tell you to spend
every waking moment with her.

54:31.333 --> 54:33.400
I got news for you, kiddo.

54:33.402 --> 54:37.773
As long as you live under
my roof, you owe me answers.

54:38.840 --> 54:40.874
- Fine.
- Where you goin'?

54:40.876 --> 54:43.077
- Just get outta the way, Mom.
- Where you think you're goin'?

54:43.079 --> 54:44.845
- Don't you... no...
- Move, just move. Just move!

56:14.469 --> 56:18.572
Wow, you guys
built this in grade school?

56:18.574 --> 56:21.778
Yeah. My Dad helped us build it.

56:23.179 --> 56:26.512
We barely ever
come here anymore, though.

56:26.514 --> 56:28.981
You shouldn't even be in here,
actually.

56:28.983 --> 56:34.787
Seriously?
No girls policy.

56:34.789 --> 56:37.826
Yeah, well, it's kinda like our place, ya know?

56:39.494 --> 56:42.061
I thought you didn't hang out
with them anymore?

56:42.063 --> 56:44.800
Yeah, I guess.

56:51.539 --> 56:53.474
That was a while ago.

56:53.476 --> 56:57.514
Awww. Aren't you guys cool.

56:59.215 --> 57:01.050
So now what?

57:15.731 --> 57:18.231
Hey, go slow.
Hold on, hold on.

57:18.233 --> 57:19.999
Sorry.

57:20.001 --> 57:22.572
OK, it's OK. Just go slow.

57:26.641 --> 57:30.579
Holy shit.

57:31.547 --> 57:33.813
Wha... What's up, man?

57:33.815 --> 57:37.217
Oh, what's up, man?
You tell me, playboy?

57:37.219 --> 57:39.086
Nothing,
we were just hangin' out.

57:39.088 --> 57:41.655
OK, these two were
just hangin' out, Timmy.

57:41.657 --> 57:45.124
- Oh, that's cool.
- Oh, wait. Oh, wait, I'm sorry,

57:45.126 --> 57:47.260
did I say, "hanging out,"
'cause what I meant to say was

57:47.262 --> 57:49.595
Conrad's over here finger-blasting
the hell outta Grace.

57:49.597 --> 57:51.164
- Dude, Hunter, shut up.
- You shut up!

57:51.166 --> 57:54.767
Let's just get outta here,
dude, they're fine.

57:54.769 --> 57:57.304
- How's this not piss you off?
- Are you two gonna leave?

57:57.306 --> 57:59.072
'Cause we were
just getting started,

57:59.074 --> 58:01.510
and I'd really like
to get back to it.

58:03.012 --> 58:07.584
C'mon. C'mon, let's go.

58:09.018 --> 58:10.720
Jesus.

58:19.661 --> 58:20.894
What the hell, man?

58:20.896 --> 58:24.167
Grow up, Hunter.

58:27.869 --> 58:29.670
<i>I'm seriously sorry about that.</i>

58:29.672 --> 58:32.238
Stop apologizing for them.

58:32.240 --> 58:35.208
I bet neither of them
even kissed a girl before.

58:35.210 --> 58:37.012
What are they doing?

58:38.880 --> 58:41.847
Um, they're heading up north
for the night.

58:41.849 --> 58:43.749
For what?

58:43.751 --> 58:46.822
To pack up Eric's dorm room.

58:47.722 --> 58:48.925
You're not going?

58:50.358 --> 58:51.860
No.

58:53.596 --> 58:56.162
- Don't you think you should?
- God, stop.

58:56.164 --> 58:59.166
- What?
- You sound just like them.

58:59.168 --> 59:03.269
I'd just get in the way
and be miserable the whole time.

59:03.271 --> 59:06.606
Besides, if I don't go,

59:06.608 --> 59:09.141
then we'd have
the place to ourselves.

59:09.143 --> 59:12.012
You don't think your parents
have thought of that?

59:12.014 --> 59:14.947
Yeah, they gave me this whole
lecture on trust and stuff.

59:14.949 --> 59:17.219
But I'm not a child.

59:23.324 --> 59:26.092
Sleep with me tonight, Conrad.

59:26.094 --> 59:29.195
It's just that, I just...

59:29.197 --> 59:32.067
wanted things to be
about us right now. Ya know?

59:33.168 --> 59:38.405
I want to. I just...
I just...

59:38.407 --> 59:40.673
What? What?

59:40.675 --> 59:42.277
- I don't know.
- What, what?

59:48.282 --> 59:50.416
Well, I guess
you think about it,

59:50.418 --> 59:56.222
and then you can come back later tonight...
Whatever happens, happens.

59:56.224 --> 01:00:02.731
But... if you do want to,
then we need to be ready.

01:00:03.431 --> 01:00:05.134
Know what I mean?

01:00:06.434 --> 01:00:08.434
Yeah, think so.

01:00:08.436 --> 01:00:12.271
Alright.
See you later tonight?

01:00:12.273 --> 01:00:14.009
Alright.

01:00:39.068 --> 01:00:40.336
There you go.

01:00:42.403 --> 01:00:44.072
Can I help you with something?

01:00:45.407 --> 01:00:47.410
No. I'm good.

01:01:18.306 --> 01:01:20.142
Sorry.

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:25.878
Is that all?

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.215
Yeah. And some condoms, too.

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:31.854
- What's that?
- Um, some condoms, please.

01:01:32.788 --> 01:01:34.354
What kind?

01:01:34.356 --> 01:01:37.160
I don't care. It doesn't matter.

01:01:49.036 --> 01:01:51.139
Eighteen seventy-nine.

01:01:53.007 --> 01:01:54.840
Oh.

01:01:54.842 --> 01:01:57.144
Watch where you're goin', dude.

01:01:57.146 --> 01:01:58.981
You watch it.

01:02:01.215 --> 01:02:04.083
- Hey, hold up, man.
- Just stay away from me.

01:02:04.085 --> 01:02:08.454
Look... I'm sorry.

01:02:08.456 --> 01:02:09.822
Alright.

01:02:09.824 --> 01:02:12.461
No, no, no, seriously,
I am, OK?

01:02:14.262 --> 01:02:17.930
It's just not the same
without you around.

01:02:17.932 --> 01:02:20.800
I mean, we're all supposed
to be in this together, right?

01:02:20.802 --> 01:02:22.469
And now Tim doesn't
even wanna talk to me anymore.

01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:24.871
Oh, so now because you lost
your two best friends

01:02:24.873 --> 01:02:27.009
you feel bad
that we let some kid die?

01:02:30.211 --> 01:02:32.311
Hey, can we just
talk for a minute?

01:03:55.496 --> 01:03:58.063
I didn't think
you'd ever get here.

01:03:58.065 --> 01:03:59.100
Hi.

01:04:00.168 --> 01:04:05.338
Wow, you look beautiful.

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:07.043
Thanks.

01:04:52.119 --> 01:04:54.589
Have you ever played
"what if", Conrad?

01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:57.359
What do you mean?

01:04:59.628 --> 01:05:01.998
What if our lives never crossed?

01:05:03.731 --> 01:05:06.499
Like, what if we never met?

01:05:06.501 --> 01:05:08.668
You wouldn't be in my life.

01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:11.374
And everything
would be different.

01:05:14.675 --> 01:05:17.078
This whole summer
would be different.

01:05:20.081 --> 01:05:22.984
Yeah, it would be.

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:28.423
You make me really happy.

01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:30.085
You OK?

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.465
You OK?

01:06:46.467 --> 01:06:48.336
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

01:06:51.773 --> 01:06:54.110
Was last night OK?

01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:57.543
Yeah. It was perfect, right?

01:06:57.545 --> 01:07:00.315
Yeah, totally.

01:07:04.286 --> 01:07:06.119
You sure you're alright?

01:07:06.121 --> 01:07:07.556
I'm great.

01:07:16.597 --> 01:07:18.664
What are you doing?

01:07:18.666 --> 01:07:20.499
Goin' to church.
Mr. and Mrs. Morris

01:07:20.501 --> 01:07:22.267
will be here to pick me up
any minute.

01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:26.275
- Are you gonna be gone long?
- No, just a couple hours.

01:07:27.641 --> 01:07:29.611
You can make yourself
at home though.

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:35.117
My parents won't be back
until the night.

01:08:28.569 --> 01:08:31.206
Grace, we're home.

01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:45.121
She's in the shower.

01:09:09.743 --> 01:09:11.613
Where is she?

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.246
She went to church.

01:09:14.247 --> 01:09:15.814
You're not supposed
to be home...

01:09:15.817 --> 01:09:18.787
We welcomed you into our home,
and this is what you do?

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:20.923
Mr. Turner...

01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:24.492
Leave.

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:46.747
Hi, Grace.

01:09:47.649 --> 01:09:49.514
Hey.

01:09:49.515 --> 01:09:52.352
- Do you, do you have a second?
- Can you just leave me alone?

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:55.858
- It's important, OK.
- What do you want?

01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:13.841
I want to say, um...
I'm sorry.

01:10:14.975 --> 01:10:18.479
Sorry for, uh, for everything.

01:10:19.747 --> 01:10:21.580
I just, uh, needed to say that.

01:10:21.582 --> 01:10:26.354
Jesus, you're a spaz.

01:10:28.823 --> 01:10:31.593
<i>What if lies
don't cover up the past?</i>

01:10:35.663 --> 01:10:37.599
<i>Maybe they cover up
the present.</i>

01:10:40.001 --> 01:10:41.904
<i>Turn us inside out,</i>

01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:46.541
<i>and force themselves
to the surface.</i>

01:10:49.644 --> 01:10:52.644
I'm not gonna to stop
seeing him, Dad.

01:10:52.646 --> 01:10:54.714
Frankly, Grace,
after what you've done,

01:10:54.716 --> 01:10:57.482
you have no choice
in the matter.

01:10:57.484 --> 01:10:58.750
Grace.

01:10:58.752 --> 01:10:59.852
- Don't you turn your back.
- No!

01:10:59.854 --> 01:11:01.620
- We trusted you!
- Let go of me.

01:11:01.622 --> 01:11:03.822
You promised
you wouldn't betray that trust!

01:11:03.824 --> 01:11:06.326
And yet you go right ahead
and walk all over it,

01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:07.826
right when your mother and I
needed you most!

01:11:07.828 --> 01:11:10.028
You both just can't
stand the fact

01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:11.830
that I found something good.

01:11:11.832 --> 01:11:13.900
That something
actually makes me happy.

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:17.669
- Gracie, please. Stop.
- Grace. Honey,

01:11:17.671 --> 01:11:19.604
you need to be
honest with yourself,

01:11:19.606 --> 01:11:23.343
and do what's right
for this family.

01:11:23.345 --> 01:11:24.910
You gotta be kidding me.

01:11:24.912 --> 01:11:28.447
Grace,
It's already been decided.

01:11:28.449 --> 01:11:34.086
Decided by who? The two of you?

01:11:34.088 --> 01:11:37.557
You've barely even talked to
each other since Eric died.

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:41.994
You... you've barely even
looked at me since he died.

01:11:41.996 --> 01:11:43.495
He has nothing to do with this.

01:11:43.497 --> 01:11:45.867
He has everything
to do with it, Mom!

01:11:54.141 --> 01:11:55.808
Grace!

01:11:55.810 --> 01:11:57.613
Grace!

01:12:03.885 --> 01:12:05.554
Conrad?

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:11.460
Conrad?

01:12:18.132 --> 01:12:20.866
Oh, my God! Conrad!

01:12:20.868 --> 01:12:24.739
Thank God. I've been
looking everywhere for you.

01:12:36.417 --> 01:12:37.916
You... You OK?

01:12:37.918 --> 01:12:42.053
- Your parent's came home.
- I know, but listen,

01:12:42.055 --> 01:12:45.791
I don't care about what
they said, or what they want,

01:12:45.793 --> 01:12:47.692
or about them at all.

01:12:47.694 --> 01:12:51.062
You're the only one
that I care about anymore.

01:12:51.064 --> 01:12:56.035
Just...
just run away with me.

01:12:56.037 --> 01:12:58.470
- What?
- I'm serious. Let's just go.

01:12:58.472 --> 01:13:00.005
Our parents are crazy.

01:13:00.007 --> 01:13:02.642
We're better off alone
without them, together.

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:04.643
- Say you'll think about it.
- Grace, listen. Grace, listen.

01:13:04.645 --> 01:13:06.211
You've already runaway.
We could live here for a while,

01:13:06.213 --> 01:13:09.016
- and plan something out.
- Grace, stop!

01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:18.723
What is it?

01:13:18.725 --> 01:13:21.130
Conrad, talk to me.

01:13:31.538 --> 01:13:33.876
I let your brother die.

01:13:36.109 --> 01:13:38.844
Wh.. What?

01:13:38.846 --> 01:13:41.680
- I'm sorry.
- Wh.. what are you talking about?

01:13:41.682 --> 01:13:44.217
The night of the accident
I was out with Hunter and Timmy,

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:46.184
and it was just supposed to be
this prank,

01:13:46.186 --> 01:13:48.220
and nobody was
supposed to be home, but he was.

01:13:48.222 --> 01:13:50.723
- Slow down.
- He chased us and he hit that deer.

01:13:50.725 --> 01:13:52.758
You're not making any sense.
What are you talking about?

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:59.130
He hit the tree, and we didn't,
we didn't stay, I wish we had.

01:13:59.132 --> 01:14:02.637
No, no, he was alone.

01:14:03.604 --> 01:14:05.440
He wasn't, Grace.

01:14:09.944 --> 01:14:14.045
This isn't...
this isn't funny.

01:14:14.047 --> 01:14:18.453
This isn't a fun joke, don't...
tell me you're joking.

01:14:25.827 --> 01:14:28.527
It's true.

01:14:28.529 --> 01:14:30.295
Oh, my God, it's true,

01:14:30.297 --> 01:14:32.697
- I can see it in your face.
- Grace, please.

01:14:32.699 --> 01:14:35.634
- You watched him die.
- I didn't watch him die, Grace.

01:14:35.636 --> 01:14:38.803
- I wanted to stay, I wanted to help him.
- You said you were there.

01:14:38.805 --> 01:14:40.208
I did.

01:14:41.309 --> 01:14:43.209
Oh, my God.

01:14:43.211 --> 01:14:46.211
- Why would you do that to me?
- Grace, stop, listen.

01:14:46.213 --> 01:14:48.951
No, don't tell me to stop.

01:14:51.319 --> 01:14:54.990
I let you sleep with me, Conrad!

01:14:55.923 --> 01:14:58.226
I let you sleep with me.

01:14:59.894 --> 01:15:02.164
Grace, I love you.

01:15:07.702 --> 01:15:12.037
I don't want to see your face.

01:15:12.039 --> 01:15:16.211
I never want to
see anything of you ever again.

01:15:55.015 --> 01:15:59.120
Mom? Dad?

01:16:59.279 --> 01:17:00.948
What's wrong?

01:17:06.119 --> 01:17:07.889
Gracie!

01:17:19.867 --> 01:17:22.837
I'm sorry.

01:17:29.476 --> 01:17:32.244
<i>We thought he'd be OK.</i>

01:17:34.148 --> 01:17:36.685
And then when he wasn't...

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.088
I just didn't know what to do.

01:17:41.756 --> 01:17:43.792
You mighta
saved that boy's life...

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.429
and you might not have.

01:17:49.162 --> 01:17:52.900
Gonna be an old man one day
and you'll still wonder.

01:17:57.904 --> 01:17:59.871
Yeah.

01:17:59.873 --> 01:18:01.275
OK.

01:18:12.753 --> 01:18:18.025
<i>As we get older, we
all come to a fork in the road.</i>

01:18:22.395 --> 01:18:26.400
<i>As we choose our path,
some of us grow wiser...</i>

01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:29.871
<i>and some of us don't.</i>

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.743
<i>Some relationships last...</i>

01:18:35.976 --> 01:18:37.979
<i>some disappear.</i>

01:18:40.247 --> 01:18:46.220
<i>But what once was,
can't stay the same...</i>

01:18:49.422 --> 01:18:52.493
<i>no matter how much
we wish it otherwise.</i>

01:18:55.095 --> 01:18:58.500
<i>Truth is, no one gets it right,</i>

01:19:00.134 --> 01:19:03.003
<i>but I think we're
all supposed to try.</i>

01:19:31.599 --> 01:19:33.499
Mr. Turner, please.

01:19:33.501 --> 01:19:36.304
There's something
I need to tell you.

01:19:45.112 --> 01:19:46.914
I'm sorry.

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:55.521
<i>I don't remember what
I said on that porch that evening,</i>

01:19:55.523 --> 01:19:59.394
<i>or how her parents
exactly reacted.</i>

01:20:05.966 --> 01:20:10.068
<i>Moments like that,
they cloud your memory.</i>

01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:12.006
<i>Leave only a feeling...</i>

01:20:14.307 --> 01:20:17.011
<i>a feeling you can't ever shake.</i>

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:35.497
<i>Wherever she is,
I hope she's OK.</i>

01:20:38.164 --> 01:20:42.170
<i>Losing someone, you don't
really ever get over it.</i>

01:20:44.537 --> 01:20:46.537
I'm home.

01:20:46.539 --> 01:20:48.042
Hey.

01:20:49.577 --> 01:20:52.177
You have a good night?

01:20:52.179 --> 01:20:54.382
Yeah. Pretty good, I guess.

01:20:58.985 --> 01:21:00.322
Well, that's good.

01:21:01.689 --> 01:21:04.226
Go on inside
and tell your Mom you're home.

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:08.460
Mom.

01:21:08.462 --> 01:21:11.463
<i>Making peace
with the past, well,</i>

01:21:11.465 --> 01:21:14.168
<i>sometimes it seems impossible.</i>

01:21:17.371 --> 01:21:19.304
<i>Maybe it's supposed to be.</i>

01:21:19.306 --> 01:21:22.042
Dad, you coming?

01:21:23.144 --> 01:21:24.512
Yeah.

01:21:26.146 --> 01:21:27.916
I'm coming, Eric.
