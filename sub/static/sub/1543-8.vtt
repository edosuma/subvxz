WEBVTT

00:03.670 --> 00:06.674
You were a demon.
You still have the mark.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.911
Sooner or later, that's gonna be an issue.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.818
My men brought in a runaway last night.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.754
She's got zero manners.
Didn't even thank me for saving her.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.984
Those vampires stole you. They're monsters.

00:17.184 --> 00:21.189
You think when the rest of them find out you
left, they'll just shrug and cut their losses?

00:21.388 --> 00:23.163
- This your family?
- Yes.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.859
How'd they die?

00:25.926 --> 00:26.996
Horribly.

00:28.095 --> 00:31.008
- You know what to do with her?
- Jody, I've done things.

00:31.198 --> 00:34.577
You don't have to explain.
If you want, I'm here.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.612
- Is Sheriff Hanscum around?
- She's off the rest of the week.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.546
- I already lost 10 pounds.
- In one day?

00:40.741 --> 00:42.743
My husband, Doug, left me last year.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.219
Doug's a dick. You deserve better.

00:45.412 --> 00:47.050
You betcha.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.700
You can get through this.

02:21.808 --> 02:22.980
How old are you?

02:23.810 --> 02:24.948
Nineteen.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.030
Get yourself some lunch.

02:44.464 --> 02:47.206
- Thanks a lot for coming.
- Yeah.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.642
Thanks. There you go. Have fun.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.484
Hi.

02:56.677 --> 03:00.523
Hi. Yeah, welcome. Come on.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.353
Sheriff...

03:05.552 --> 03:08.999
Sheriff Jody Mills, Sioux Falls. Okay.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.499
I'm Sheriff Donna Hanscum.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.064
I work out of Stillwater,
but I grew up here...

03:14.261 --> 03:19.404
...so you have any questions, you know,
best burgers, cheapest gas, just ask.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.075
What's wrong?

03:22.269 --> 03:24.909
Left your smile back in Sioux Falls?

03:26.073 --> 03:27.848
I left a kid back in Sioux Falls...

03:28.041 --> 03:30.681
...plus a pile of work,
but when the mayor insists you go...

03:30.877 --> 03:33.187
You gotta go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear you.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.293
- Here. Have a sucker.
- No, thank you.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.058
Okay.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.625
Donna.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.963
- Doug.
- Well, aren't you looking good?

03:48.595 --> 03:49.938
I lost six pounds.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.110
Hey, you're a quarter of the way there.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.873
Hey, you, uh...? You think you could
toss me a couple extra meal vouchers?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.914
I mean, since you won't be using them.

04:08.548 --> 04:11.722
You are true blue as ever, Donna. Huh?

04:12.219 --> 04:13.960
Yeah.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.003
Doug and I used to be married.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.904
Got it.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.971
Have fun. Yeah.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.284
Hey-We good?

04:40.247 --> 04:43.626
Aces. Yeah, I love the smell of parchment
in the morning.

04:43.817 --> 04:47.492
I mean, how much lore is even left?
You've got nothing on the mark?

04:47.687 --> 04:50.827
Right? You'd think these eggheads,
with all the crap they amassed...

04:51.024 --> 04:55.439
...would've actually collected
something important. Uh, here. Ahem.

04:55.595 --> 04:58.838
A Study in Werewolf Transgenderism. â€œ

04:59.666 --> 05:02.146
Six-hundred pages, volume one.

05:02.335 --> 05:05.509
But, uh, not something important like,
I don't know...

05:05.672 --> 05:07.948
...maybe the oldest symbol known to man.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.679
That's not worth our time.
It's not weird enough.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.785
Good morning.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.956
Excuse me.
If I could get you all seated, please.

05:21.288 --> 05:27.000
Uh, good morning.
I'm Sheriff Len Cuse, Hibbing P.D.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.299
I'd like to say first off...

05:29.496 --> 05:33.569
...what an honor it is to have you all here
in Hibbing this year in...

05:35.735 --> 05:38.181
Sorry. Sorry.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.744
Sorry, folks, there's...
Sorry about that, uh...

05:43.243 --> 05:45.985
What was I...? Right, right.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.922
Seeing as how this is my first time hosting
one of these things...

05:50.150 --> 05:52.426
...I thought I'd like to try something new.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.035
Partners.

05:58.859 --> 06:03.035
Find an officer from 50 miles
outside of where you hail from...

06:03.430 --> 06:06.434
...and be a team this weekend.

06:06.666 --> 06:09.272
Go on, uh, and make a friend.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.912
Alex, I know you'll be okay.

06:16.109 --> 06:21.422
You are totally capable of not throwing a kegger
while I'm gone. Totally, totally capable.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.619
My faith in you astounds me too.
I'll call you later.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.965
- On.
- Hi.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.300
- Hi.
- Looks like you didn't get a partner.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.942
- Looks like.
- Well, you got one now.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.076
- Hi, Kevin.
- Hi, Donna.

06:49.276 --> 06:54.055
- Okay, what do we got?
- The Snow Must Go On."

06:54.214 --> 06:57.889
Ha, ha. "Establishing a K-9 Unit."

06:58.084 --> 06:59.620
Okay. Oh!

06:59.819 --> 07:02.595
Why Not Try it?"

07:03.123 --> 07:05.831
Ha, ha. Why not? I don't know.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.062
- Hey, Donna?
- Yeah.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.104
- Hear about the body?
- What body?

07:09.296 --> 07:10.331
Yeah, what body?

07:11.631 --> 07:13.133
Sheriff Jody Mills.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.940
Trashman found it behind the hardware store
this morning, eaten.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.911
- Eaten how'?
- Like, nothing left but the peach pit, you know?

07:21.808 --> 07:23.583
Any idea what did it?

07:23.743 --> 07:26.519
Coroner's saying animals out of the woods.
Bobcats and whatnot.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.024
No wonder Sheriff Cuse
was out of sons back there.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.785
Got this whole mess to deal with.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.931
- Attacks like this common for the area?
- Heck, no.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.657
When I lived here,
we kept our critters in check.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.503
Did it leave any tracks, you know?
Any hairs?

07:40.694 --> 07:42.503
Not even a claw mark on the body.

07:43.530 --> 07:44.634
I'll be right back.

07:44.831 --> 07:47.710
Okay. Yeah. Save you a seat, Jods.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.679
No way. Heh.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.820
Jody. How's it going?

07:56.009 --> 08:00.856
Oh, you know, having the time of my life
at a sheriffs' retreat in Hibbing.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.288
Wow, sounds like a blast.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.791
Uh, Dean says hi.

08:05.785 --> 08:07.321
You found him?

08:07.520 --> 08:09.397
- Thanks for telling me.
- Yeah.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.536
Uh, right, sorry about that.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.534
How's he doing?

08:13.727 --> 08:18.005
Good. Good. Yeah, you know. You know, hold
on a sec, I'm gonna put you on speaker.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.979
Hey, Jody. How's Alex holding up?

08:22.335 --> 08:25.009
Awesome.
Already head of the cheerleading squad.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.650
Wow, really?

08:26.840 --> 08:29.719
No. Sam, she smokes grass
under the bleachers.

08:29.909 --> 08:32.719
- But at least she's not luring men to their deaths.
- Right.

08:33.046 --> 08:36.186
This may not be your thing,
but a body was found here this morning...

08:36.383 --> 08:38.419
...and something had gone
to chow town on it.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.025
Uh, was the throat ripped out?

08:41.221 --> 08:45.226
Worse. I'm hearing that all the flesh
had been eaten down to the bones.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.496
- Any ideas?
- Well, it's not a vampire.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.437
Yeah, I don't know, Jody. I got nothing.

08:50.663 --> 08:54.736
Jody, um, we could head that way.
Wouldn't be any trouble at all.

08:54.934 --> 08:58.108
No, I can handle it. I'll call if
it gets to be something I can't.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.745
All right. Well, uh, enjoy the retreat.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.355
Screw you, Winchester.

09:05.945 --> 09:07.185
Talk soon.

09:07.347 --> 09:11.227
I'm gonna swallow a bag of knives if I
gotta keep looking at this stuff. Let's...

09:11.418 --> 09:14.456
- Jody said she was on top of it, Dean.
- Uh-huh.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.304
All right. Let's take a drive.

09:33.273 --> 09:37.278
Hey. Sheriff Jody Mills. I wanna take a look
at the body they brought in this morning.

09:37.777 --> 09:40.883
Sure. Soon as you become a member
of the Hibbing Police Department.

09:42.048 --> 09:45.393
- I'm just trying to help here.
- And I'm just trying to not lose my job.

09:48.221 --> 09:52.465
- Hey, stranger.
- Hi, Shelley. How are the kids?

09:52.659 --> 09:55.333
Little jerks. I love them to death.
Ha, ha. Need something'!

09:55.562 --> 09:58.168
- Just came to check out the vie.
- Where's Len at?

09:58.398 --> 10:00.901
He's tied up with the retreat.
Big surprise, right?

10:01.101 --> 10:04.674
But what's the sense in having a hotel
full of sheriffs if you can't help out?

10:04.904 --> 10:07.077
Someone's gotta get you a halo
or something.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.275
But, um, what's her deal?

10:09.742 --> 10:10.846
Sheriff Mills.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.587
Might say she left her manners
back in Sioux Falls.

10:13.746 --> 10:17.091
- Ah.
- But she's with me.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.424
- Oh.
- So, what do you say? Curtains up?

10:24.958 --> 10:27.495
Hold onto your breakfasts.
This one's grisly.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.003
Ate the whole kit and caboodle,
that's for darn sure.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.678
- You got a measuring tape?
- Yeah.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.518
Can I see his personal effects?

11:02.061 --> 11:04.507
That string bean wore these?

11:04.697 --> 11:07.007
- Where's the belt?
- He wasn't wearing any.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.713
These stayed up without a belt?

11:10.336 --> 11:13.579
Or wild animals stole it.

11:14.974 --> 11:17.716
Jody-o, check this out.

11:22.015 --> 11:25.428
You know, I've been hunting
since I could hold a mini-rifle...

11:25.652 --> 11:29.930
...seen darn near every bite in the book, but
I couldn't tell you what did the biting here.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.261
I was afraid of that.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.266
Meaning?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.099
Nothing. Got me stumped too.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.544
Don't go smoking, Howie.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.915
Ugh. Just watch your Top Model.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.962
Aah! Hey!

13:29.709 --> 13:30.710
Hi, Len.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.684
How's that seltzer treating you?

13:41.321 --> 13:42.732
Something I can help you with?

13:42.889 --> 13:45.199
That animal attack last night
sounded real bad.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.398
- Yeah, it sure was. Yeah.
- What kind of animal you thinking did it now?

13:49.729 --> 13:53.677
Oh, I don't know. Something.
Got Animal Control on it.

13:53.866 --> 13:55.868
That's it?

13:56.903 --> 13:58.507
Jody Mills, Sioux Falls.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.748
Sheriff Cuse. We have, uh...

14:03.076 --> 14:06.182
...an issue with the...

14:06.679 --> 14:07.714
...raffle.

14:08.748 --> 14:09.852
Right.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.263
Excuse me, I should go see to this.
Uh, ahem.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.524
Enjoy your night, sheriffs.

14:17.090 --> 14:20.537
He's got about as much idea as we do.
Squat.

14:21.027 --> 14:25.772
You know, maybe he's right.
Just let Animal Control take the lead.

14:36.442 --> 14:39.423
I used to put the cans in his cart.

14:41.180 --> 14:43.558
You really miss him much?

14:46.052 --> 14:48.794
Honestly, Donna, I just met the guy...

14:49.389 --> 14:51.300
...but Doug seems like kind of a dick.

14:53.459 --> 14:54.938
But he was my dick.

15:00.767 --> 15:04.806
I'm gonna go hit the can,
you know, where it's less gross.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.940
- Let's keep this to ourselves.
- Everything okay?

15:16.983 --> 15:18.326
Yeah, it's all good.

15:18.951 --> 15:20.328
All good with the raffle.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.129
Can we get real, please?

15:27.293 --> 15:30.240
All right, um, you want real? Um...

15:30.830 --> 15:32.332
Somebody else turned up dead.

15:33.332 --> 15:36.336
- Looks like another animal attack.
- Please, don't spread that.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.641
We don't wanna spoil everyone's good time.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.851
- Or get too many cooks in the kitchen?
- Exactly.

15:42.175 --> 15:46.487
Now, uh, Deputy Graham and I
gotta go make a few calls...

15:47.513 --> 15:50.255
...so try and have a good time. All right?

16:07.533 --> 16:09.809
Alex, stop.

16:10.002 --> 16:11.504
No...

16:11.771 --> 16:14.377
Why do I hear firecrackers?

16:14.640 --> 16:16.347
Hello-J?

16:18.044 --> 16:21.025
So maybe your life's not
all cupcakes either.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.051
Never said it was.

16:25.284 --> 16:29.027
Uh-oh. Flying the coop without me? Again?

16:29.222 --> 16:30.997
- No.
- No, I get it. I do.

16:31.190 --> 16:34.660
- Take a hint, Donna. Right? It's okay.
- There's been another animal attack.

16:36.062 --> 16:38.338
Shut the front door. Says who?

16:38.698 --> 16:41.372
I just talked to Sheriff Cuse.

16:41.567 --> 16:46.380
I was on my way out to the morgue, but
it's probably closed by now anyway, and...

16:47.540 --> 16:49.713
it'll wait till tomorrow.

16:51.410 --> 16:53.083
Anything I can help with there?

16:54.547 --> 16:57.255
Not unless you got any gems
on how to handle a teenage girl.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.054
Because mine is...
- Kind of a dick?

17:04.056 --> 17:07.594
She's got a whole lot more in there too.

17:07.894 --> 17:10.067
Really good stuff.

17:11.097 --> 17:16.240
I was 17 once. You know, hair up to here.
Attitude up to here.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.742
Why can't I get through to her?

17:20.940 --> 17:23.443
You let anybody through to you at that age?

17:23.943 --> 17:25.547
Joey DeMoupied.

17:26.779 --> 17:30.852
Drove a motorcycle. Smelled like...

17:31.017 --> 17:33.361
Mm. Yeah.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.366
She'll come around. You did, right?

17:40.560 --> 17:46.909
So fresh corpse, jerk ex-husband,
out-of-control teen.

17:47.099 --> 17:50.603
Wanna gel blingoed on my minibar
and watch pay-per-view?

17:50.970 --> 17:53.382
Thanks. I'm gonna crash.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.079
It's been a long day.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.319
Don't I know it.

18:29.175 --> 18:32.122
- I said I could handle it.
- Nice to see you too.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.018
Hey.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.021
I'm headed to the morgue, you want in'?

18:36.182 --> 18:37.684
- We just came from there.
- And?

18:37.917 --> 18:40.659
And flesh was eaten off the second vie too.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.424
Anything missing?

18:43.022 --> 18:44.365
His wallet. Why?

18:44.523 --> 18:47.026
Because I think a belt
was missing off the first kid.

18:47.460 --> 18:52.000
A belt? So, what, we have monsters eating
and then robbing people?

18:52.999 --> 18:54.171
Jody-o, you take sugar?

18:55.801 --> 18:58.338
No. No sugar.

18:58.704 --> 18:59.808
"Jody-o"?

19:00.006 --> 19:02.350
It's... Don't ask.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.488
Wait a second. Isn't that, uh, Donna?

19:07.513 --> 19:08.821
- Fat-spa Donna. Yeah.
- Right.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.460
You guys know my stalker?

19:11.050 --> 19:13.223
She nearly blew a case for us last time.

19:13.452 --> 19:16.524
I haven't been able to shake
that ray of sunshine since I got here.

19:17.056 --> 19:18.694
She's actually been pretty helpful.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.462
It's just tough
keeping her out of this nightmare stuff.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.471
Right. You mind distracting her
while we poke around?

19:24.730 --> 19:26.505
You show up and now I'm a babysitter?

19:27.066 --> 19:30.878
She hasn't gotten mixed up with this crap
yet. Let's just try to keep it that way.

19:32.238 --> 19:35.344
Fine. But if she tries to show me
her sticker collection, I'm out.

19:35.541 --> 19:38.249
Agent Frehley? Agent Criss?

19:38.477 --> 19:39.597
- Hey, Sheriff Hanscum.
- Hi.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.257
I thought that was you.
Ain't this a kick in the pants?

19:42.515 --> 19:46.019
- What dragged you in?
- Uh, well, we can't talk about it.

19:46.218 --> 19:47.993
Oh, yeah. I hear you.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.430
- Anything I can help with?
- No, no, no. Nothing. Ahem.

19:53.059 --> 19:56.939
Actually, sheriff, I was thinking you and I
could go check out the gear expo.

19:58.497 --> 19:59.669
What about the morgue?

20:00.099 --> 20:02.773
You know, like you said,
Animal Control will handle that.

20:07.273 --> 20:09.549
- If it's cool with you, it's cool with me.
- Great.

20:09.742 --> 20:13.019
I did hear they're packing
some pretty serious heat in there.

20:13.412 --> 20:14.447
Hurry.

20:19.618 --> 20:20.790
Hey there.

20:21.020 --> 20:24.092
Agents Criss and Frehley.
Looking for the sheriff.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.098
Of Hibbing.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.232
That'd be me.

20:29.428 --> 20:32.409
We're here investigating the attacks
over the last couple nights.

20:32.598 --> 20:34.407
Just wondering where you're at on that.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.740
- On the, uh, animal attacks?
- Yeah.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.918
Wait, you're telling me the FBI
has got nothing better to do?

20:41.440 --> 20:43.442
Well, we go where the boss tells us to.

20:43.642 --> 20:47.089
To what, arrest a bobcat from Hibbing?

20:47.580 --> 20:48.991
Is there a problem?

20:50.316 --> 20:52.091
No. No, there's no problem.

20:52.985 --> 20:56.091
You ain't the first feds to roll
through here and come up with nothing.

20:56.288 --> 20:59.428
- Sure is cute to watch you try though.
- Pal, the FBI doesn't do cute.

20:59.625 --> 21:03.664
Sheriff Cuse, we're just hoping there might
be some surveillance footage of the attacks.

21:03.929 --> 21:08.344
- Maybe a traffic camera caught something.
- Right. No. Sorry, I don't have a record of it.

21:11.670 --> 21:15.777
Speaking of, uh, can you keep an eye
on the expo for me, deputy?

21:15.975 --> 21:18.649
I gotta check in
with the guys at Animal Control.

21:18.844 --> 21:20.619
Agents, good to meet you. Uh...

21:21.480 --> 21:24.154
Help yourself to a bear claw.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.661
Sheriffs lying.

21:35.194 --> 21:37.470
Pfft. Deputy Douche seems to think so.

21:38.164 --> 21:40.474
All right. I'll go try and crack
the police sewer.

21:40.666 --> 21:44.136
- Maybe something showed up on surveillance.
- Maybe I'll go crack the deputy.

21:44.336 --> 21:48.216
Right. But this time, try to be a little
less defensive of your "pretend job."

21:48.674 --> 21:51.985
You know, this badge means something.

21:52.178 --> 21:53.384
I made it at Kinko's.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.121
Yes, you did.

21:56.715 --> 21:57.716
Be proud of that.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.223
Son of a gun.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.200
Officer ladies. Here, check this one out.

22:05.858 --> 22:09.135
You can take it to lunch, to the gym,
have your nails done.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.830
She's always by your side.

22:13.732 --> 22:15.734
How about this puppy?

22:15.901 --> 22:18.848
Well, it depends.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.676
Think you can handle a big one?

22:23.342 --> 22:26.721
- Sigma, right?
- Ten pounds pull weight. Cute.

22:26.912 --> 22:28.585
You call this a big one?

22:28.747 --> 22:30.920
Hope you drive a Porsche.

22:31.684 --> 22:35.757
Chaz, if you're trying to pull the wool
over this one, you got the wrong girl.

22:35.921 --> 22:39.425
Sheriff Hanscum here
is a wolf in sheep's skin, right? Ha, ha.

22:39.692 --> 22:43.265
Thank you. Wolves are majestic creatures.

22:43.596 --> 22:46.270
But save your flattery
for other female people.

22:46.599 --> 22:50.274
Oh. Oh, Sheriff Goodhill.
No, no. I mean, yeah.

22:50.436 --> 22:53.042
But, no, we just met.
Cufflinks, you know how it is.

22:53.239 --> 22:55.446
Cuff-what?
- Cufflinks.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.188
It's a dating site for cops.
You on it, Donna?

22:58.377 --> 23:01.790
Me? No. Not quite there yet.

23:01.947 --> 23:05.588
You still, uh, getting in date shape?
Huh? Huh?

23:07.553 --> 23:10.932
It's more like trying to get through
the stuff on my DVR first.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.899
- Ha, ha.
- Oh, for the love of God.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.469
What is wrong with you?

23:15.294 --> 23:17.467
You get off on fat-shaming chicks?

23:17.730 --> 23:19.471
You are so not fat, by the way.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.473
And you...

23:22.134 --> 23:24.978
...you are just a douche.

23:28.307 --> 23:32.483
Well, okay. I'll just, uh...

23:34.079 --> 23:35.217
Okay, then.

23:37.483 --> 23:41.488
What the H-E double hockey sticks, Jody?
Calling my ex "a douche" to his face.

23:41.654 --> 23:45.397
- Didn't look like you were gonna do it.
- What would be the point? We're divorced.

23:45.557 --> 23:47.559
You really think I'm gonna change him now?

23:47.726 --> 23:50.002
So he gets to treat you
like a doormat forever?

23:50.229 --> 23:52.675
How about this?
Till you've actually lost a husband...

23:52.831 --> 23:54.811
...you keep your mouth zipped about mine.

24:18.524 --> 24:22.165
Did something happen? To your husband?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.669
We all have our crosses to bear, right?

24:26.832 --> 24:28.505
- Hey, I'm sorry if I...
- No.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.205
It's fair. I certainly went there.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.549
- You wanna talk about it...?
- Not right now.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.883
All right, then.

24:40.279 --> 24:41.519
I'm gonna go get some air.

24:53.692 --> 24:59.574
Agent, are you looking for some
teeny-weeny handcuffs to slap on some paws?

24:59.732 --> 25:02.906
Heh. I think we got off on the wrong foot.

25:03.702 --> 25:06.342
Right. How's that exactly?

25:06.538 --> 25:10.509
Well, this investigation that my
partner and I are here on, it's big.

25:10.709 --> 25:13.883
And, uh, we're looking for some local help.

25:14.079 --> 25:17.856
You know, someone who's not afraid
to talk shop with the big boys back in D.C.

25:18.050 --> 25:21.088
Think that might be something
you'd be interested in?

25:22.588 --> 25:24.261
Might be.

25:24.423 --> 25:25.902
What can I do?

25:26.091 --> 25:29.334
Well, first of all, I'm gonna need you
to be totally straight with me.

25:29.595 --> 25:32.769
Is there any footage of the attack?
Anything?

25:40.406 --> 25:43.444
Sheriff Cuse changed the password
on the server yesterday.

25:44.243 --> 25:47.281
It's got the live feed from the
traffic camera across the street...

25:47.446 --> 25:51.451
...from where that first vic got attacked.
When I went to go check the footage...

25:51.917 --> 25:53.590
...sheriff said he'd do it himself.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.129
Did he say why?

25:57.723 --> 26:01.637
But, you know, sheriff's a straight
shooter. I'm sure he had his reasons.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.134
I'm sure he did.

26:04.463 --> 26:08.309
I appreciate the cooperation, deputy.
When I need you, I'll come find you, okay?

26:08.734 --> 26:10.736
- All right.
- All right.

27:33.051 --> 27:34.553
Animal attack my ass.

27:34.786 --> 27:36.390
You seen Sheriff Cuse around?

27:36.622 --> 27:39.228
- Not since the expo.
- Yeah, me neither.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.336
How you doing, kiddo?

27:42.528 --> 27:45.065
Me? I'm fantastic. Why?

27:45.697 --> 27:49.201
Word around the campfire is
you went off the res a couple months back.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.210
That right?

27:51.503 --> 27:54.211
You and Sam been passing notes
during class?

27:54.673 --> 27:56.152
It's nothing I can't handle.

27:56.341 --> 27:59.879
Just saying, I make a mean bowl of chowder
if you ever need to talk.

28:01.547 --> 28:03.424
I appreciate that.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.260
- Hey.
- You got something?

28:05.484 --> 28:07.054
Uh, well, there was something.

28:07.252 --> 28:10.665
I hacked into the surveillance sewer
but the files have been deleted.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.598
Sheriff Cuse was the only one
who had access to those files.

28:13.825 --> 28:16.396
- Here she comes. Hey.
- Hi.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.875
Jody, can we talk a sec'?

28:19.898 --> 28:20.933
Alone.

28:23.101 --> 28:25.445
Yeah, we'll go look around.

28:27.072 --> 28:30.053
Okay, first of all,
back there, I was wrong to butt in.

28:30.242 --> 28:33.246
- I know it hurt you, and I'm sorry.
- What?

28:33.445 --> 28:37.518
Oh, yeah, quit being a doormat. Yeah.
I hear you, Jody. It's okay. We're okay.

28:37.716 --> 28:42.461
Only, there's something else
I can't quite wrap my head around.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.037
You ever think there are things out there?

28:47.926 --> 28:49.769
Things that...

28:50.095 --> 28:52.268
...don't end up an the police blotter?

28:54.299 --> 28:57.473
- Can you give me some specifics?
- Yeah, okay.

28:57.703 --> 29:02.413
Well, I was kind of far away, so maybe I
didn't see it right, but what I think I saw...

29:02.908 --> 29:04.717
...were teeth.

29:08.113 --> 29:10.218
It was Sheriff Cuse.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.656
I saw him standing
over Sheriff Goodhill's body...

29:12.884 --> 29:16.730
...and his mouth was full of shark teeth
like some kind of...

29:17.322 --> 29:18.323
Monster.

29:19.958 --> 29:22.734
- You think I'm crazy?
- Not at all.

29:22.928 --> 29:27.570
- Did he see you?
- No. I hid. Like a chump.

29:28.133 --> 29:29.407
You really believe me?

29:29.601 --> 29:33.413
Yeah. So will those guys from the FBI.

29:34.473 --> 29:35.850
If you say so.

29:36.074 --> 29:41.251
Hey, yesterday, I saw Cuse taking his stuff
into a room down the hall from mine.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.119
Must have been...

29:43.348 --> 29:45.157
...304.

29:47.152 --> 29:49.758
This is Agent Frehley. Leave me a message.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.162
Sam, Cuse is our guy.

29:52.357 --> 29:56.362
Donna said she saw him check in to 304.
Hit me back.

29:56.595 --> 29:59.769
What now'? Just let the locals handle it?

30:00.999 --> 30:04.105
Oh, trust me,
the locals should not handle this.

30:33.298 --> 30:34.818
Look at all this sunblock.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.340
You'd think he's at the Copacabana
or something.

30:38.503 --> 30:39.914
I'll explain later.

31:04.763 --> 31:06.174
What the heck is that for?

31:09.334 --> 31:11.007
Oh. Whoa.

31:12.671 --> 31:13.706
I got your voice-mail.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.783
- Sheriff is a vampire.
- She just pulled out a machete.

31:16.007 --> 31:19.352
- Donna saw his teeth.
- What the cuss? A vampire?

31:20.612 --> 31:24.287
Ahem. You wanna give her the talk?

31:28.120 --> 31:29.190
Heck.

31:30.255 --> 31:33.293
Just heck.

31:34.459 --> 31:36.200
Are we good?

31:36.461 --> 31:40.136
- Wait, so when we were at the
weight loss spa... Monsters.

31:41.266 --> 31:42.939
Sucking on your fat.

31:43.969 --> 31:45.949
We took care of them.

31:46.405 --> 31:50.751
Oh, jeez. I knew losing 10 pounds that fast
was too good to be true.

31:54.579 --> 31:59.255
Here. Maybe this is where
Sheriff Vampire went.

32:03.054 --> 32:04.124
It could be anything.

32:12.063 --> 32:15.067
- What do you got?
- Looks like it's an old farm outside of town.

32:17.102 --> 32:19.480
- Could be something.
- And it's the only lead we got.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.276
We?

32:22.908 --> 32:26.481
All due respect, sheriff,
but vampires are far more dangerous...

32:26.678 --> 32:29.921
...than the johns you throw in jail.
- You're gonna sit this one out.

32:30.749 --> 32:34.322
Stuff you, Dean.
Or whatever your real name is.

32:34.519 --> 32:35.759
Hanscum's good.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.159
- Jody.
- I said she's good.

32:43.528 --> 32:46.702
Okay, all right. But you stay in back.

32:46.932 --> 32:48.468
We're taking the lead, okay?

33:36.882 --> 33:39.260
If you gotta swing, swing hard.

33:39.484 --> 33:41.054
With vamps, heads gotta roll.

33:42.487 --> 33:44.228
Got it.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.625
Run.

34:43.047 --> 34:46.552
Heh. Well, hi there, sunflower.

34:59.664 --> 35:02.508
It's all love, pretty boy.

35:03.435 --> 35:07.645
All of you will become all of us.

35:07.839 --> 35:09.648
We won't waste one bit.

35:09.841 --> 35:12.845
Okay, Mufasa,
enough with the circle-of-life crap.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.691
- You're a vampire. You're scum. End of story.
- Mm-hm.

35:21.186 --> 35:23.462
Hey, I'm not in the mood.

35:29.194 --> 35:32.471
Wait, it's not enough that you kill people,
you've gotta rob them too?

35:32.664 --> 35:37.943
We scavenge. We don't sip and go.
We use every part of the buffalo.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.310
And to think I gave you lunch money.

35:40.505 --> 35:44.715
- But you came in time for dinner.
- Starr, please let them go.

35:44.976 --> 35:49.516
I helped you out. I ditched that
video of Catfish killing that man.

35:49.714 --> 35:52.388
We didn't want favors, Len.

35:52.550 --> 35:53.620
We wanted you.

35:54.185 --> 35:56.529
What use am I now? I
don't even kill people.

35:56.721 --> 35:57.859
I'm on bagged blood.

35:58.056 --> 36:02.232
I beg your pardon? I saw you with your
vampire face standing over Sheriff Goodhill.

36:08.733 --> 36:10.576
No, no, no. I found her.

36:22.247 --> 36:28.220
I smelled her blood.
I couldn't help my... My fangs.

36:31.856 --> 36:34.029
- But I didn't bite.
- Well, aren't you a hero?

36:34.225 --> 36:36.603
It's your nature to eat people.

36:37.095 --> 36:40.907
A vampire who doesn't feed is like a...
Like a...

36:41.099 --> 36:42.442
Tiger eating salad.

36:44.602 --> 36:46.775
We aren't gonna slop, Len.

36:47.005 --> 36:51.579
We'll take down every person
in your sweet little Hibbing...

36:51.776 --> 36:53.619
...till you some back to the nest.

36:54.412 --> 36:56.221
So, what'd you do, Len?

36:56.414 --> 36:59.623
You, uh, break up Burning Man?

37:00.251 --> 37:01.628
More like Woodstock.

37:02.921 --> 37:06.459
Len found me crying on the curb
after my daddy kicked me out.

37:06.624 --> 37:11.130
I got in Len's van and
the rest is wavy gravy.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.635
So, what, Len's like your Charlie Manson?

37:14.799 --> 37:18.542
Oh. Charlie couldn't hold a candle to Len.

37:20.138 --> 37:22.414
He taught us everything.

37:22.807 --> 37:25.788
Yeah, I'm sure it was all kombucha
and "Kumbaya."

37:25.977 --> 37:28.617
Liberating is what it was.

37:28.813 --> 37:31.987
And then one day, poof, Len's gone.

37:32.150 --> 37:34.562
Till he landed his photo in the paper.
Stupid.

37:34.886 --> 37:38.595
Ha, ha. For running a police retreat,
of all things.

37:39.157 --> 37:43.003
You didn't just go straight,
you became a damn cop.

37:43.161 --> 37:47.166
Now, that is wild, man.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.279
Are you feeling dirty, Len?

37:50.468 --> 37:53.176
Because we're about to have ourselves
a bloodbath.

37:56.508 --> 38:00.354
- Don't you wanna know why I left?
- I already know why.

38:00.578 --> 38:03.354
You got boring.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.325
I got a conscience.

38:07.952 --> 38:11.593
Prey that begged for their
lives, it was like...

38:11.790 --> 38:17.172
...even if I used every part, like I
taught you, I mean, it's still wrong.

38:18.196 --> 38:19.300
So, you walked away?

38:20.298 --> 38:22.835
I tried to protect people.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.707
Man, after so many years of gutting them.

38:30.675 --> 38:32.655
That's why I'm here.

38:35.180 --> 38:40.152
I'll join your bloody caravan,
if it means you won't kill these people.

38:41.519 --> 38:43.123
We aren't killing anyone.

38:45.123 --> 38:46.568
You are.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.003
You don't have to do this.

39:02.407 --> 39:03.909
Kiss my ass.

39:11.249 --> 39:12.694
We love you, brother...

39:14.719 --> 39:18.166
...but we don't know who you are anymore.

39:29.434 --> 39:30.936
Can't say we didn't try.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.808
Hakuna matata, lady.

40:08.139 --> 40:09.777
That's what I'm talking about.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.917
You okay?

40:19.117 --> 40:20.289
Yeah.

40:20.485 --> 40:23.728
Other than feeling like I wanna hurl, sure.

40:24.622 --> 40:29.765
- Hey.
- I just chopped off a vampire's head.

40:30.328 --> 40:32.501
- You were great at that.
- Thanks.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.643
- You good?
- Yeah.

40:36.668 --> 40:39.342
Yeah, you know,
for the first time I've been back...

40:39.504 --> 40:41.745
...I didn't feel like the
mark was pushing me.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.675
First time?

40:43.841 --> 40:47.516
Knowing that these things are out there...

40:48.446 --> 40:53.327
...makes the world seem,
I don't know, bigger.

40:53.818 --> 40:55.354
Darker.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.999
All I know is back there,
killing those vamps...

40:59.991 --> 41:01.197
...I felt like me again.

41:02.527 --> 41:06.669
All right. So that's good, right?

41:07.365 --> 41:08.366
Yeah.

41:09.867 --> 41:14.145
You know, if you want any pointers
on how to fight this crazy crap...

41:14.339 --> 41:17.286
...I'm willing to fill you in.
You know, what kills what.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.517
I'd like that.

41:21.879 --> 41:23.517
Good.

41:24.048 --> 41:25.527
Let's go with that.
