12:07.590 --> 12:11.100
Frank Alana the other day and he said

12:09.539 --> 12:12.149
that my old team was doing just fine

without me

12:12.149 --> 12:16.169

12:14.100 --> 12:18.389
captains have to be diplomatic

I on the other hand demons but since i'm

12:18.389 --> 12:22.860
so impressed with your commitment to be

12:20.129 --> 12:26.539

Thank You Jenna

12:30.089 --> 12:34.839
why the change of heart

12:33.159 --> 12:37.370
it's obvious to me you found in your

12:34.839 --> 12:39.020
home

12:37.370 --> 12:42.070
you know I just wish I felt better about

12:39.019 --> 12:43.840
leaving their meaning what

12:42.070 --> 12:46.000
I'm not real happy about the way shot is

12:43.840 --> 12:48.160
running the team you know there's been

12:46.000 --> 12:49.299
talks about certain irregularities and

12:48.159 --> 12:52.309
the way he's been promoting private

12:49.299 --> 12:54.049
sponsorship

12:52.309 --> 12:55.559
hate to disappoint you Jenna but I've

12:54.049 --> 12:57.389
got nothing to tell you

12:55.559 --> 12:58.979

12:57.389 --> 13:01.169
eyes open

12:58.980 --> 13:02.460
just think about it leave with you on

13:01.169 --> 13:04.019
the team together we could really keep

13:02.460 --> 13:06.300
an eye on shot and help keep that place

13:04.019 --> 13:10.649
going and you wouldn't have to worry

13:06.299 --> 13:33.579
about me reassigning again whatever

13:10.649 --> 13:42.250
threat of course not it's just the true
