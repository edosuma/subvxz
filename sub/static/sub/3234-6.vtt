<i>Hey, Bobby, need you to look in on Mrs.

03:13.574 --> 03:15.642
Janet, Jesus,
we got a homicide.

03:15.676 --> 03:17.644
<i>Come again?
Miss Peyketewa, she's dead.</i>

03:17.678 --> 03:20.213
<i>I need some backup out here.

show yourself right now.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.602
Hold it right there!
Let me see your hands.

03:42.636 --> 03:43.970
Hands!

03:47.107 --> 03:48.574
All right, down.

03:48.609 --> 03:50.009
On your knees.

03:50.044 --> 03:53.546
You understand me?
Do you speak English?

03:54.782 --> 03:57.617
[speaks Spanish]

Yeah, well...

05:06.253 --> 05:08.988
You know best, right?

05:09.022 --> 05:10.590
Anything else?

05:10.624 --> 05:12.325
<i>Do you have any thought</i>

05:12.359 --> 05:17.897
about how we're going to
approach this with Walter Jr?

05:29.576 --> 05:32.612
<i>Well, I--</i>

05:32.646 --> 05:34.714
I think he gets it.
Don't you?

05:36.884 --> 05:38.885
I mean, I--

05:38.919 --> 05:41.854
I think he saw it coming.

05:41.889 --> 05:44.056
He sees your unhappiness
and--

<i>My unhappiness?</i>

<i>My completely

05:55.435 --> 05:58.371
Look, as you said,
for the best.

05:58.405 --> 06:00.072
Yeah.

06:00.107 --> 06:04.477
Okay, um, last thing,
and then I'll let you go.

That's right, all of it.

06:20.627 --> 06:22.762
Walt...

06:22.796 --> 06:24.096
No.

06:24.131 --> 06:26.866
<i>Skyler, you wanted me out.</i>

06:26.900 --> 06:30.002
I'm out, but I will
provide for my family.

06:30.037 --> 06:32.138
<i>Not with that money.</i>

06:32.172 --> 06:35.374
You'd be making us
accessories after the fact.

06:35.409 --> 06:37.476
Skyler, how do you think
we've been paying our bills

06:37.511 --> 06:39.278
these last six months?

06:43.350 --> 06:45.985
I have to go.

06:46.019 --> 06:47.420
Yep, I was right.

06:47.454 --> 06:50.056
Three units available,
exact same floor plan.

06:50.090 --> 06:51.791
I can call over, get you in

06:51.825 --> 06:53.292
to see any of the others
if you'd like.

06:53.327 --> 06:54.927
No. No, this one's fine.

06:54.962 --> 06:57.296
I'll take it.

06:59.700 --> 07:03.169
Now, unfortunately,
this one is the model, so--

07:03.203 --> 07:04.770
Yeah, I like it.

07:04.805 --> 07:07.573
I like everything about it.

07:07.608 --> 07:10.610
I'll-- I'll take it as is.

07:11.878 --> 07:13.512
[chuckles]

07:13.547 --> 07:14.814
Name one thing in this world

07:14.848 --> 07:16.215
that is not negotiable.

07:23.156 --> 07:25.591
Oh, Jesus.
You have to clean the fryer.

07:25.626 --> 07:27.326
Yes, sir.

07:30.497 --> 07:32.264
So we try to clean them
every night,

07:32.299 --> 07:33.532
but make sure it's off

07:33.567 --> 07:36.402
before you open
the intake valve.

07:36.436 --> 07:37.470
Good.
[door chimes ring]

07:37.504 --> 07:39.472
Now, I suggest
that you add this

07:39.506 --> 07:41.173
to your Monday
maintenance schedule.

07:47.781 --> 07:49.582
Main valve on, main switch on.

07:49.616 --> 07:52.218
Give the compressor time for
the needle to enter the green.

08:03.830 --> 08:07.600
You're for real.
This is all you?

08:07.634 --> 08:09.035
All me.

08:09.069 --> 08:11.270
[Skinny Pete] Heisenberg who?
That's what I say.

08:11.304 --> 08:13.339
My man Jesse can cook.

08:13.373 --> 08:16.842
Check it, yo.
It ain't cloudy or dirty or nothing.

08:16.877 --> 08:18.144
Just the right shade of blue.

08:18.178 --> 08:19.345
[Badger] Good shade.

08:19.379 --> 08:21.047
Check out that crystal size,
yo.

08:21.081 --> 08:23.516
If that bitch was any bigger,
it would be a Jolly Rancher.

08:23.550 --> 08:26.986
Be my guest.
Hit it.

08:28.355 --> 08:30.589
You sure?

08:30.624 --> 08:33.793
I feel kind of diggish with
you being in rehab and all.

08:33.827 --> 08:37.596
No. I can watch, yo.

08:37.631 --> 08:40.032
I can cook, and I can watch.

08:40.067 --> 08:43.169
Go for it. I tried it, like, last week.
I'm still coming down.

08:43.203 --> 08:45.571
Go easy.

08:46.573 --> 08:48.841
Okay.

08:48.875 --> 08:50.309
[crunch]

08:55.882 --> 08:57.650

09:04.491 --> 09:07.059
<i>Whoo! Riverdance!</i>

09:07.094 --> 09:10.796
Hey-- Hey, stop marking up
my floor, dumbass. Come on.

09:10.831 --> 09:14.867
Whoa-- Whoa-- ooh!

09:14.901 --> 09:16.335
Bow before me.

09:16.369 --> 09:17.536
Wow.

09:17.571 --> 09:19.939
I am Lord of the Dance.
Huh?

09:19.973 --> 09:21.540
[laughing]

09:21.575 --> 09:24.343
Shit.
I gotta try that again.

09:24.377 --> 09:26.445
Uh, yeah, no,
I think you're good.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.248
That is awesome, Jesse.

09:29.282 --> 09:32.151
I feel like somebody took
my brain out

09:32.185 --> 09:35.187
and boiled it in, like,
boiling hot--

09:35.222 --> 09:37.022
It's the bomb, man, seriously.

09:37.057 --> 09:39.992
...like-- like anthrax.
[laughs]

09:40.026 --> 09:42.027
Good.

09:42.062 --> 09:44.029
So, um...

09:44.064 --> 09:45.998
You ready to talk
some business?

09:47.868 --> 09:51.170
You mean, this is not, like, just...
recreational?

09:51.204 --> 09:57.143
Uh-uh. I know
what you're thinking.

09:57.177 --> 10:00.546
Trust me. It's not going
to be like it was--

10:00.580 --> 10:03.282
all right,
never gonna be like it was.

10:03.316 --> 10:05.718
How's that?
We sell it safe.

10:05.752 --> 10:08.220
All right? We sell it smart.

10:08.255 --> 10:10.456
We don't get greedy...

10:10.490 --> 10:11.557
Like before.

10:11.591 --> 10:14.326
I don't know, man.

10:14.361 --> 10:16.228
Combo and all.

10:24.638 --> 10:26.205
Still.

10:26.239 --> 10:29.208
Man's gotta make his living.

10:29.242 --> 10:31.177
If it's like Jesse says

10:31.211 --> 10:33.913
and we're not greedy...

10:33.947 --> 10:37.683
I mean, I guess I can see it.

10:37.717 --> 10:39.685
Had a good thing going before
we started pushing our luck.

10:39.719 --> 10:40.853
Yeah.

10:40.887 --> 10:43.189
If it can go back to being
like that and all--

10:43.223 --> 10:44.557
Hey, it will be.

10:44.591 --> 10:47.393
Step 1--
we build inventory.

10:47.427 --> 10:48.794
Badger, go see Clovis.

10:48.829 --> 10:51.730
Get the RV in shape--
tune up, oil change,

10:51.765 --> 10:53.532
brake lights, and whatnot.

10:53.567 --> 10:55.734
Cops always pull you over
for brake lights.

10:55.769 --> 10:57.469
Not us.

10:57.504 --> 10:58.604
Cautious.

10:58.638 --> 10:59.905
You got it.

10:59.940 --> 11:02.474
All right,
you know that buzzer thing.

11:02.509 --> 11:04.610
Leave the key in the ignition,
and it buzzes, whatever.

11:04.644 --> 11:08.013
Yeah. Just have him put
in one of those, too.

11:08.048 --> 11:10.316
Skinny, you're
in charge of supplies.

11:10.350 --> 11:12.685
I'll get you a list.

11:12.719 --> 11:14.320
[Skinny] Right on.

11:14.354 --> 11:16.455
Yeah?

11:16.489 --> 11:18.657
[Badger] Yeah.
Let's do this. All right.

11:20.594 --> 11:23.629
So, uh... we good?

11:23.663 --> 11:24.697
Yeah.
We good?

11:24.731 --> 11:25.865
Right on, man.
All right.

11:25.899 --> 11:29.001
Let's do this thing.

11:42.816 --> 11:45.017
Brandon Mayhew.

11:45.051 --> 11:46.752
I know you.

11:48.521 --> 11:50.623
Small world, Albuquerque.

12:51.936 --> 12:53.770
Want to talk about it?

12:53.804 --> 12:56.406
Why? It's not like
I get a vote.

12:59.476 --> 13:01.177
You know, ironically,

13:01.212 --> 13:05.715
I think you're going to see
much more of me from now on.

13:05.749 --> 13:09.586
- Sure.
- Well, just as much of me at least.

13:09.620 --> 13:12.455
I'm taking you to the school,
to and from, every day.

13:12.489 --> 13:15.058
What, I don't get a vote
in this, either?

13:15.092 --> 13:16.859
I gotta stop going with Louis

13:16.894 --> 13:19.229
just because
you're feeling guilty?

13:21.599 --> 13:23.566
I do feel guilty.

13:28.672 --> 13:31.941
I am the man that I am, son,

13:31.976 --> 13:34.978
and there's plenty I would
change about that, but...

13:37.381 --> 13:39.249
Here we are

13:39.283 --> 13:42.218
and this is just what it is.

13:48.826 --> 13:50.393
You know what?

13:50.427 --> 13:54.530
Call me crazy, but I'm actually
feeling very good about the future.

14:30.067 --> 14:31.734
Morning.

14:31.769 --> 14:34.737
They're back.

14:34.772 --> 14:36.306
Uh, I'm just wondering

14:36.340 --> 14:38.808
if we should maybe call
the police or something.

14:38.842 --> 14:40.777
Why?

14:40.811 --> 14:42.879
They're doing nothing wrong.

14:48.118 --> 14:50.586
Okay, let's put this
on table 33, okay?

15:34.131 --> 15:37.633
[clatters, buzzing]

16:15.472 --> 16:17.340
[Man] Hello, there.

16:18.675 --> 16:21.344
Uh, Mr. White, I presume?

16:21.378 --> 16:24.881
Oh, yes. Hi.
I am-- Sorry.

16:24.915 --> 16:27.483
I'll be right down.

16:37.194 --> 16:39.262
Hi. Gale Boetticher.

16:39.296 --> 16:40.930
Hi.

16:42.099 --> 16:44.434
You're my new lab assistant,
I take it.

16:44.468 --> 16:45.902
Yes, I am.

16:45.936 --> 16:48.638
I suppose you'll want
to hear my qualifications.

16:48.672 --> 16:51.307
I have my, uh--
my resume here for you.

16:53.510 --> 16:56.479
I received
my bachelor's degree from UNM,

16:56.513 --> 16:59.215
my master's from
the University of Colorado.

16:59.249 --> 17:03.152
Organic chemistry
with a specialty in--

17:03.187 --> 17:04.787
It's all right there.

17:04.821 --> 17:08.057
"X-ray crystallography."

17:08.090 --> 17:09.392
Really.

17:11.862 --> 17:13.463
I could talk about that
for hours.

17:13.497 --> 17:15.964
I would love to.

17:15.999 --> 17:18.634
Well, first,
I'm curious about this.

17:21.939 --> 17:24.973
That's a little pet project
of mine.

17:25.008 --> 17:26.342
Hm.

17:26.376 --> 17:27.910
See, in my opinion,

17:27.944 --> 17:30.780
it's all about
the quinic acid level.

17:30.814 --> 17:34.851
You want just north
of 4,800 milligrams per liter,

17:34.885 --> 17:36.819
but if you over-boil
to get there,

17:36.854 --> 17:38.488
you're going to leach
your tannins.

17:38.522 --> 17:41.090
Bitterness. Yuck.

17:41.124 --> 17:43.392
So I pull a mild vacuum.

17:43.427 --> 17:48.297
That way, I can keep the temperature
no higher than 92 C, and uh...

17:51.535 --> 17:53.169
Let's see.

17:53.203 --> 17:56.105
Judge for yourself.
[hisses]

18:08.919 --> 18:10.319
Oh, my God.

18:17.694 --> 18:21.197
My God, that is the best
coffee I've ever tasted.

18:21.231 --> 18:23.833
[chuckles]

18:23.867 --> 18:25.968
Sumatran beans,

18:26.003 --> 18:28.004
and I also have to give
credit to the grind,

18:28.038 --> 18:30.973
but, uh, thank you,
Mr. White.

18:31.008 --> 18:32.775
Walt, please.

18:32.809 --> 18:34.343
Call me Walt.

18:34.378 --> 18:37.246
Huh, why the hell
are we making meth?

18:38.348 --> 18:39.649
[chuckles]

19:45.415 --> 19:49.018
[pops]

19:49.352 --> 19:53.889
Tell me, with the phenylacetic
acid solution,

19:53.924 --> 19:58.427
you said 150 drops per minute
for the first 10 minutes,

19:58.461 --> 20:00.562
and then 90 for the remainder.

20:00.597 --> 20:02.398
Why is that?

20:02.432 --> 20:05.668
Well, my thinking is,

20:05.702 --> 20:11.674
by tapering the phenyl, you get an
oilier aqueous layer, and hence--

20:11.708 --> 20:14.109
Better benzene extraction.

20:14.144 --> 20:16.011
Exactly.
[chuckles]

20:16.046 --> 20:18.347
But actually I prefer ether.

20:18.381 --> 20:20.316
Oh. I'll have it
for tomorrow.

20:27.324 --> 20:31.160
Gale, I'm wondering how you--

20:31.194 --> 20:33.262
Ended up here.

20:33.296 --> 20:36.165
Well, actually,
I'm still wondering

20:36.199 --> 20:39.802
how I ended up here, but, yes.

20:39.836 --> 20:41.904
I mean, I can't imagine

20:41.938 --> 20:44.239
we strike each other
as criminals.

20:44.274 --> 20:48.644
Well, there's crime,

20:48.678 --> 20:52.147
and then there's crime,
I suppose.

20:53.450 --> 20:55.184
I'm definitely a libertarian.

20:55.218 --> 20:57.987
Consenting adults
want what they want,

20:58.021 --> 20:59.488
and if I'm not supplying it,

20:59.522 --> 21:01.890
they will get it
somewhere else.

21:01.925 --> 21:04.727
At least with me, they're getting
exactly what they pay for.

21:04.761 --> 21:08.230
No added toxins or adulterants.

21:09.899 --> 21:13.902
Yeah, I was doing it
the way you are supposed to,

21:13.937 --> 21:15.738
pursuing my doctorate
at Colorado,

21:15.772 --> 21:17.206
NSF research grant.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.575
I was on my way,

21:19.609 --> 21:22.611
jumping through hoops,
kissing the proper behinds,

21:22.645 --> 21:25.981
attending
to allhe non-chemistry

21:26.016 --> 21:28.350
that one finds oneself
occupied with.

21:28.385 --> 21:30.119
You know that world.

21:30.153 --> 21:33.022
That is not
what I signed on for.

21:36.126 --> 21:40.195
I love the lab.

21:41.731 --> 21:43.298
Because it's all still magic.

21:43.333 --> 21:44.800
You know?

21:46.936 --> 21:49.772
Chemistry?

21:49.806 --> 21:54.109
I mean, on you lose that...

21:54.144 --> 21:58.080
It is. It is magic.

21:58.114 --> 22:00.682
It still is.

22:00.717 --> 22:02.551
[chuckles]

22:02.585 --> 22:04.086
And all the while
I kept thinking

22:04.120 --> 22:06.088
about that great,
old Whitman poem.

22:07.390 --> 22:09.591
"When I Heard
the Learn'd Astronomer."

22:09.626 --> 22:11.160
Walt Whitman.

22:11.194 --> 22:12.694
I-- I don't know it.

22:12.729 --> 22:14.463
Uh, anyway...

22:14.497 --> 22:15.864
Well, can you recite it?

22:19.869 --> 22:22.371
Pathetically enough I could.

22:22.405 --> 22:24.606
All right, well...

22:24.641 --> 22:27.142
No, no, come on.
Come on.

22:27.177 --> 22:28.410
Yeah?

22:33.716 --> 22:36.251
When I heard
the learn'd astronomer;

22:36.286 --> 22:39.354
When the proofs, the figures,

22:39.389 --> 22:42.124
were ranged in columns
before me;

22:42.158 --> 22:44.993
When I was shown the charts
and the diagrams,

22:45.028 --> 22:47.963
to add, divide,
and measure them;

22:47.997 --> 22:51.400
When I, sitting, heard the
astronomer, where he lectured

22:51.434 --> 22:55.304
with much applause
in the lecture-room,

22:55.338 --> 23:01.243
How soon, unaccountable,
I became tired and sick;

23:01.277 --> 23:03.745
Till rising and gliding out,

23:03.780 --> 23:06.014
I wander'd off by myself,

23:06.049 --> 23:10.119
In the mystical moist
night-air,

23:10.153 --> 23:11.787
and from time to time,

23:11.821 --> 23:14.423
Look'd up in perfect silence

23:14.457 --> 23:16.391
at the stars.

23:23.299 --> 23:26.935
Yes, I am a nerd.

23:30.306 --> 23:32.407
Bravo.
Thank you.

23:34.878 --> 23:37.079
[Hank sighs] Come on, Pinkman.

23:37.113 --> 23:39.414
You little rat bastard.

23:39.449 --> 23:41.950
Get off your lazy ass
and go bream the law.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.974
[phone ringing]

24:18.321 --> 24:19.454
Hey, baby.

24:19.489 --> 24:21.256
<i>[Marie]
Are you ever coming home?</i>

24:21.291 --> 24:22.958
Marie, I'm working.
All right?

24:22.992 --> 24:24.660
<i>Did you find it? The RV?</i>

24:24.694 --> 24:28.397
<i>Nope. Working on it, so...</i>

24:28.431 --> 24:30.032
Why can't you just arrest him,

24:30.033 --> 24:31.266
make him tell you?

24:31.301 --> 24:33.569
<i>[sighs]
It's not that simple, baby.</i>

24:33.603 --> 24:35.304
<i>There's a little thing
called The Constitution.</i>

24:35.338 --> 24:37.406
The Constitution, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

24:40.977 --> 24:43.745
<i>This kid, I swear to God,
I wish I just could--</i>

24:43.780 --> 24:45.047
<i>[groans]</i>

24:45.081 --> 24:48.050
This is that Pinkman character?

24:48.084 --> 24:49.718
<i>That's the one.</i>

24:49.752 --> 24:51.720
<i>Positive the little bastard
has got an RV,</i>

24:51.754 --> 24:54.256
and I just don't know
where he keeps it.

24:54.290 --> 24:56.124
Until he actually leads me
to where--

24:56.159 --> 24:59.261
or does something,
I'm stuck here, Marie,

24:59.295 --> 25:01.997
so... sorry.

25:02.031 --> 25:05.968
Well, um... not to bring up
ancient history,

25:06.002 --> 25:09.871
but I for one can think of someone
who might know something...

25:11.407 --> 25:13.242
Possibly.

25:13.276 --> 25:14.743
It's worth a shot.

25:14.777 --> 25:16.979
Yeah?

25:18.081 --> 25:19.681
Who?

25:19.716 --> 25:21.617
[phone rings]

25:23.353 --> 25:24.753
Hello.

25:24.787 --> 25:26.488
<i>[Hank] Oh, hey, buddy.
Hey, how you doing?</i>

25:26.522 --> 25:28.690
Oh, hey, Hank.
What's up?

25:28.725 --> 25:30.058
<i>Listen, I hate to bother you.</i>

25:30.093 --> 25:32.361
<i>I just-- I just, uh--
I just have a quick question.</i>

25:32.395 --> 25:33.996
Oh, shoot.

25:34.030 --> 25:36.164
<i>Now, I'm only asking you this
because I'm at a, you know,</i>

25:36.199 --> 25:38.066
dead-end here potentially.

25:38.101 --> 25:41.370
I'm working a case,
and, uh--

25:41.404 --> 25:43.105
[sighs]

25:43.139 --> 25:45.774
Listen, you gotta know that I
would never put you on the spot

25:45.808 --> 25:47.276
<i>or make you uncomfortable.</i>

25:47.310 --> 25:50.045
Hank, you could just
cut to the chase.

25:50.079 --> 25:53.115
Back when we lost you

25:53.149 --> 25:54.883
and I was trying
to track you down

25:54.917 --> 25:57.252
<i>through a former student
of yours, Jesse Pinkman,</i>

25:57.287 --> 26:00.289
<i>now, you know that I know</i>

26:00.323 --> 26:02.891
that once upon a time he may
have dealt you a little weed.

26:02.925 --> 26:04.660
Hank--

26:04.694 --> 26:07.829
<i>Just a little, and I so
do not care about that.</i>

26:07.864 --> 26:10.265
As far as I'm concerned,
you never inhaled, okay?

26:10.300 --> 26:12.034
<i>Like you said,
cut to the chase.</i>

26:12.068 --> 26:14.870
<i>Do you remember
if this Pinkman kid</i>

26:14.904 --> 26:16.872
<i>ever had an RV?</i>

26:20.777 --> 26:22.844
<i>You know,
a recreational vehicle,</i>

26:22.879 --> 26:25.180
<i>you know,
like a Winnebago-type deal,</i>

26:25.214 --> 26:28.183
brown and beige?

26:28.217 --> 26:31.353
Uh, why?

26:31.387 --> 26:33.422
<i>Well, it's a long story,</i>

26:33.456 --> 26:35.691
<i>but I'm personally of the opinion
that he's moved on from weed</i>

26:35.725 --> 26:38.093
<i>and graduated to selling
crystal meth,</i>

26:38.127 --> 26:40.729
<i>using it as a rolling lab.</i>

26:46.402 --> 26:48.203
Walt?

27:03.403 --> 27:04.837
Yo.

27:08.742 --> 27:10.509
What? Mr. White.

27:17.417 --> 27:18.984
[groans]

27:22.856 --> 27:24.290
[phone beeps]

27:27.460 --> 27:29.862
<i>[Saul]
Hey, how's my favorite genius?</i>

27:29.896 --> 27:31.263
Is this a secure line?

27:31.298 --> 27:33.232
<i>[laughs]
Is this a secure--</i>

27:33.266 --> 27:34.500
<i>Yes, what's with the--</i>

27:34.534 --> 27:36.068
Hey, hello to you, too.

27:36.102 --> 27:38.704
<i>Listen, we've got a problem,
a DEA problem.</i>

27:38.738 --> 27:39.939
Okay, I'm listening.

27:39.973 --> 27:42.608
<i>My brother-in-law,
he knows about the RV.</i>

27:42.642 --> 27:43.943
What RV?

27:43.977 --> 27:45.411
Our RV,

27:45.445 --> 27:47.580
the one which contains
a meth lab,

27:47.614 --> 27:48.848
<i>which is covered
with my fingerprints.</i>

27:48.882 --> 27:50.182
<i>Ring a bell?</i>

27:50.217 --> 27:52.084
Okay, what exactly does
"knows about" mean?

27:52.118 --> 27:53.786
Does he have it?
Has he searched it?

27:53.820 --> 27:56.522
No, he knows it exists,
and he's trying to find it.

27:56.556 --> 27:57.756
<i>He has linked it to Jesse,</i>

27:57.791 --> 27:59.024
<i>and it's only a matter of time</i>

27:59.059 --> 28:00.759
<i>before he tracks it down,
so--</i>

28:00.794 --> 28:03.362
<i>So get rid of it. What are you doing
sitting here talking to me for?</i>

28:03.396 --> 28:05.531
<i>Better yet,
have Pinkman get rid of it.</i>

28:05.565 --> 28:07.299
<i>Right? You don't go near it.</i>

28:07.334 --> 28:08.667
No, no, listen,
my brother-in-law,

28:08.702 --> 28:10.369
he is surveying Jesse's house.

28:10.403 --> 28:12.471
<i>Do you understand?
So he might've tapped the phones</i>

28:12.505 --> 28:14.039
<i>or bugged his house.</i>

28:14.074 --> 28:15.574
<i>Jesus. Plan A, then.</i>

28:15.609 --> 28:17.376
Go. Get to it
before the feds do.

28:17.410 --> 28:20.713
And do what exactly?

28:20.747 --> 28:22.882
I mean, what--

28:22.916 --> 28:26.819
The thing-- The thing
is the size of a--

28:26.853 --> 28:28.320
It's RV size.

28:28.355 --> 28:31.056
<i>I mean, where do I go
to make an RV disappear?</i>

28:31.091 --> 28:32.591
I'm not David Copperfield.

28:32.626 --> 28:33.859
<i>What do I look like,</i>

28:33.894 --> 28:35.594
the RV disposal people?

28:35.629 --> 28:36.729
Did you not plan

28:36.763 --> 28:38.731
<i>for this contingency?
No.</i>

28:38.765 --> 28:40.599
Well, next time,
plan for it, would you?

28:40.634 --> 28:43.035
<i>The Starship Enterprise
had a self-destruct button.</i>

28:43.069 --> 28:45.804
I'm just saying.
Okay, oh, shut up.

28:45.839 --> 28:47.640
I'm just saying, you know,

28:47.674 --> 28:49.241
you're good with tools and all.

28:49.276 --> 28:54.446
Why don't you invent a
water-powered car, you know?

28:54.481 --> 28:56.682
If you did that,
you would be rolling in it.

28:58.685 --> 29:00.352
Socket wrench.

29:00.387 --> 29:01.620
The big one.

29:03.123 --> 29:04.790
What?

29:04.824 --> 29:06.458
You scared of the Arabs?

29:09.129 --> 29:10.763
[screeching]

29:13.066 --> 29:15.467
Are you out of your mind?
Why is this out in the open?

29:15.502 --> 29:16.735
Who the hell are you?

29:16.770 --> 29:17.870
[Badger]
He's-- He's Heisenberg.

29:17.904 --> 29:19.004
Is this drivable?
Does it run?

29:19.039 --> 29:20.306
Yeah, I was just
changing the oil.

29:20.340 --> 29:21.740
Well, finish it, quickly.

29:21.775 --> 29:24.009
We'll wipe it clean
and take it out to the desert.

29:24.044 --> 29:25.311
Come here and help me.

29:25.345 --> 29:27.680
Hold up.
What's this about?

29:27.714 --> 29:29.648
The DEA,

29:29.683 --> 29:31.250
the Drug Enforcement
Administration.

29:31.284 --> 29:32.451
You've heard of them,
haven't you?

29:32.485 --> 29:33.519
I know you have.

29:33.553 --> 29:35.254
They know all about this RV,

29:35.288 --> 29:37.156
and they're trying
to find it right now.

29:38.925 --> 29:40.492
I want this
off my property now.

29:40.527 --> 29:43.095
No, no, no, no, no, we have
got to destroy the evidence.

29:43.129 --> 29:45.230
We've got to rig this thing to burn.
Do you understand?

29:45.265 --> 29:47.199
Not here you don't.
Just get it the hell out of here.

29:47.233 --> 29:49.401
Now, listen to me.
I need your help, okay?

29:49.436 --> 29:51.270
If I go down, we all go down.

29:51.304 --> 29:52.738
Do you understand?

29:54.040 --> 29:57.142
All right, just--
I know a better way.

29:57.177 --> 29:59.745
I know a guy that'll wipe this off
the planet, no questions asked.

29:59.779 --> 30:01.180
Call him.

30:06.286 --> 30:08.954
Hey, what about Jesse?

30:08.989 --> 30:10.222
[Walt] What about him?

30:20.767 --> 30:22.468
Hey, it's me.

30:22.502 --> 30:23.836
Wanna hear something weird?

30:23.870 --> 30:25.637
[door slams] Now, listen to me.

30:25.672 --> 30:28.607
You get that address.
Now, Badger, I don't care how!

30:28.641 --> 30:30.743
You find out
where he's taking it!

30:35.181 --> 30:36.248
Oh, yeah.

30:55.635 --> 30:57.603
Excuse me. Are you leaving?

31:11.885 --> 31:13.685
Excuse me, gentlemen.

31:13.720 --> 31:16.121
This booth
is for paying customers.

31:16.156 --> 31:17.890
Cynthia, it's okay.

31:17.924 --> 31:20.392
I'll handle this.

31:24.731 --> 31:26.265
[speaking Spanish]

31:55.829 --> 31:58.397
96, 97, 98,

31:58.431 --> 32:00.499
99, 100.

32:00.533 --> 32:02.601
Beyond recovery, right?

32:02.635 --> 32:04.403
Now, beyond recovery means--
I get it.

32:04.437 --> 32:05.971
Beyond recovery.

32:06.005 --> 32:08.740
Obliterated, no evidence.
Hey, don't worry.

32:08.775 --> 32:11.710
When we're through with it, it's
going to be about yea big, okay?

32:11.744 --> 32:13.745
Then we flatbed it
over to Long Beach,

32:13.780 --> 32:15.747
ship it across the Pacific.

32:15.782 --> 32:18.283
Chinese turn it
into patio furniture,

32:18.318 --> 32:21.753
so... mind at ease.

32:21.788 --> 32:23.355
Listen, can you do me a favor?

32:23.389 --> 32:25.424
I'm obviously going to need
a ride.

32:25.458 --> 32:26.558
Could you call a cab?

32:26.593 --> 32:28.594
You got it.
Pleasure doing business.

32:28.628 --> 32:30.195
Thank you.
I'll be right behind you.

32:30.230 --> 32:32.431
I just need to...

32:46.179 --> 32:47.513
God.

32:50.550 --> 32:51.750
[sighs]

33:08.635 --> 33:10.435
[door opens]

33:10.470 --> 33:12.871
The hell you think you're doing?
Me?

33:12.906 --> 33:14.773
No, this is mine
just as much as yours!

33:14.807 --> 33:16.742
You don't get to just--
Oh, God. Oh, God.

33:16.776 --> 33:18.143
What?

33:21.381 --> 33:22.748
God, they're out--

33:22.782 --> 33:23.982
[grunt] What?

33:25.618 --> 33:27.719
He's here.

33:27.754 --> 33:29.521
Who's here?

33:32.358 --> 33:33.959
Holy--

33:33.993 --> 33:36.195
Oh, no.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.168
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

33:43.203 --> 33:44.636
You led him right to us.

34:56.322 --> 34:58.224
[door rattles]

35:05.198 --> 35:06.766
[bangs] Shit.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.568
[Hank] Mr. Pinkman, you want
to add resisting arrest?

35:09.603 --> 35:11.971
We'll add it.
No skin off my ass.

35:13.273 --> 35:15.341
Last chance to do it
the easy way.

35:36.496 --> 35:37.730
[rattling]

35:55.882 --> 35:58.083
Got a warrant?

35:58.118 --> 35:59.985
[Hank] Who are you?

36:00.020 --> 36:02.555
Who are you? What do you
know about this RV?

36:02.589 --> 36:04.957
Well, I'm the owner
of this lot,

36:04.991 --> 36:08.527
which means you're trespassing
on private property.

36:08.562 --> 36:09.962
As far as the RV goes,

36:09.996 --> 36:11.564
seems to me it's locked,

36:11.598 --> 36:13.199
which means you're trying
to break and enter,

36:13.233 --> 36:14.466
so I say again,

36:14.501 --> 36:16.402
you got a warrant?

36:16.436 --> 36:20.139
[chuckles] Well, I don't need
one if I've got probable cause,

36:20.173 --> 36:21.207
counselor.

36:21.241 --> 36:22.842
[Man] Probable cause

36:22.876 --> 36:25.177
usually relates to vehicles,
is my understanding,

36:25.212 --> 36:27.813
you know, traffic stops
and whatnot.

36:27.848 --> 36:30.482
See these round rubber things?

36:30.517 --> 36:32.418
Wheels.

36:32.452 --> 36:33.819
This is a vehicle.

36:33.854 --> 36:37.623
This is a domicile,
a residence,

36:37.657 --> 36:41.093
and thus protected
by the Fourth Amendment

36:41.127 --> 36:42.428
from unlawful search
and seizure.

36:42.462 --> 36:44.096
Look buddy, why don't you
just go out and--

36:44.130 --> 36:46.198
Did you see this drive in here?

36:46.233 --> 36:47.499
How do you know it runs?

36:47.534 --> 36:50.569
Did you actually witness
any wrongdoing?

36:50.604 --> 36:53.606
It seems to me you're just out here...
fishing.

36:56.109 --> 36:58.577
Don't see that holding up
in a court of law.

37:01.448 --> 37:03.849
Oh, yeah?

37:03.884 --> 37:05.251
Well, look at these.

37:08.355 --> 37:10.155
What do those look like to you?

37:10.190 --> 37:13.125
They sure look
like bullet holes to me.

37:13.159 --> 37:17.796
There was a firearm discharged
inside of this "domicile."

37:17.831 --> 37:19.632
Willing to bet there's
a judge or two out there

37:19.666 --> 37:21.767
who'd see that as probable
cause, but I'll tell you what.

37:21.801 --> 37:23.602
Why don't you call
the Albuquerque police--

37:23.637 --> 37:25.838
[whispering] How could you have
known that they were there

37:25.872 --> 37:28.941
before you took off the tape?

37:28.975 --> 37:30.342
[whispers] What?

37:30.377 --> 37:32.912
How could you have known
that they were there

37:32.946 --> 37:34.580
before you took off the tape?

37:34.614 --> 37:36.815
Say it. Say it.

37:40.186 --> 37:43.188
How could you have known that they were
there before you took off the tape?

37:43.223 --> 37:45.491
That's right.

37:45.525 --> 37:49.161
Probable cause needs
to be readily apparent.

37:49.195 --> 37:50.896
Huh.

37:50.931 --> 37:53.032
There's somebody in there.

37:53.066 --> 37:54.333
...private domicile
and I won't be harassed.

37:54.367 --> 37:55.601
[Hank] Yeah, I'll tell
you what, Pinkman.

37:55.635 --> 37:58.604
Probable cause or no,
I'll give you three seconds

37:58.638 --> 38:00.739
to get your ass out here.

38:00.774 --> 38:02.541
1, 2--

38:02.575 --> 38:06.578
This is my own private domicile,
and I will not be harassed.

38:06.613 --> 38:08.514
Bitch.

38:08.548 --> 38:10.950
[Hank chuckles]

38:10.984 --> 38:13.919
Oh, yeah.

38:18.124 --> 38:20.559
Fine. You want your warrant?

38:22.595 --> 38:24.296
I'll have my guys
bring it out here

38:24.331 --> 38:26.165
and deliver it to you
on a little satin pillow.

38:26.199 --> 38:27.366
How's that?

38:27.400 --> 38:32.304
I waited this long.
Wait a little longer.

38:52.826 --> 38:54.426
Hey, Vicky.

38:54.461 --> 38:56.095
Yeah, Schrader.
Give me Merkert, will you?

39:00.633 --> 39:02.468
[sighs]

39:06.306 --> 39:09.842
You know, I say--

39:09.876 --> 39:13.245
I say we just ram him.
All right?

39:13.279 --> 39:14.446
I mean, we, uh--

39:14.481 --> 39:17.950
we-- we start her up

39:17.984 --> 39:20.352
and just ram the shit
out of his truck.

39:20.387 --> 39:22.488
We make our escape. Right?

39:23.656 --> 39:26.091
[sighs]

39:28.628 --> 39:30.062
Yeah, he'd, uh--

39:30.096 --> 39:32.431
he'd shoot me in the head.

39:33.633 --> 39:35.701
Yeah, he'd shoot me
in the head.

39:36.936 --> 39:40.105
So what do we do, man, huh?

39:40.140 --> 39:41.340
What do we--

39:41.374 --> 39:43.542
What?

39:45.045 --> 39:47.046
Please tell me

39:47.080 --> 39:48.881
you got something.

39:54.421 --> 39:56.088
Yeah, I got something.

40:08.568 --> 40:10.869
It's me.

40:10.904 --> 40:12.638
We need your help.

40:30.924 --> 40:32.491
[phone rings]

40:35.261 --> 40:36.428
Yeah.

40:36.463 --> 40:39.465
<i>[Woman] Is this
Mr. Henry R. Schrader?</i>

40:39.499 --> 40:41.166
Yeah. Who's this?

40:41.201 --> 40:44.736
<i>Sir, this is Officer Elaine Tanner
with the Albuquerque Police.</i>

40:44.771 --> 40:46.472
<i>Is your wife Marie Schrader?</i>

40:46.506 --> 40:48.807
Yes, why?

40:48.842 --> 40:52.111
<i>I'm sorry to inform you that your
wife's been in an automobile accident.</i>

40:52.145 --> 40:54.746
<i>She's being airlifted
to Los Ranchos Medical Center</i>

40:54.781 --> 40:59.017
<i>and should be arriving there
shortly.</i>

40:59.052 --> 41:00.786
How is she?
What's her condition?

41:00.820 --> 41:02.688
<i>I don't, um...</i>

41:02.722 --> 41:04.656
<i>have the most current
information, sir,</i>

41:04.691 --> 41:07.092
<i>but I think you might want to
get there as soon as possible.</i>

41:09.662 --> 41:11.830
You're going to have
to start paying me more.

41:49.836 --> 41:51.503
[no audio except low hum]

41:57.143 --> 41:59.711
[phone ringing]

42:03.550 --> 42:05.417
[ringing]

42:09.122 --> 42:11.089
<i>Marie?
I'm just checking in.</i>

42:11.124 --> 42:12.591
<i>I'd love to have some idea</i>

42:12.625 --> 42:15.627
<i>of whether I should
cook dinner or not.</i>

42:15.662 --> 42:16.929
Are you okay?

42:16.963 --> 42:19.631
<i>Yeah. Why?</i>

42:23.136 --> 42:26.538
<i>Hank? What's up?</i>

42:34.881 --> 42:37.382
<i>â™ª</i>
