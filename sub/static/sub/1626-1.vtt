00:01.531 --> 00:03.054
Welcome to the Williamsburg Diner,

00:03.062 --> 00:06.296
my name is Max 'cause the hospital
wouldn't let my mother name me "Oops".

00:08.473 --> 00:11.348
I've been out of town all summer,
anything new?

00:11.747 --> 00:13.933
Anything new? Let's see, well...

00:13.958 --> 00:16.726
Facebook went public
and Edward Snowden went private.

00:17.117 --> 00:18.792
Kim and Kanye had a baby,

00:18.817 --> 00:21.523
so now there's another Kardashian
to not keep up with.

00:23.825 --> 00:26.136
Paula Deen is out, gay marriage is in,

00:26.161 --> 00:28.882
and a teacher in California's out
for letting her students get it in.

00:30.834 --> 00:33.416
Justin Bieber got a hit-and-run,
Chris Brown got a hit-and-run,

00:33.423 --> 00:35.689
Rihanna got hit and still didn't run.

00:36.337 --> 00:40.088
Oprah gave Lindsay $2 million, cunnilingus
gave Michael Douglas throat cancer,

00:40.225 --> 00:43.585
and Michael Douglas gave guys everywhere
another excuse not to do that.

00:44.781 --> 00:47.075
Egypt went crazy,
Amanda Bynes went crazier,

00:47.100 --> 00:50.261
and the NSA checks our phone
like a crazy ex-girlfriend.

00:50.286 --> 00:52.425
Oh, and Texas hates women,
Florida hates blacks,

00:52.457 --> 00:54.135
And everybody hates everything
with the exception

00:54.136 --> 00:58.206
of Angelina Jolie,
who is totally awesome.

00:58.207 --> 01:02.810
I meant on the menu.
Anything new on the menu?

01:02.811 --> 01:04.646
I have no idea. Let me check.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.282
Hey, Caroline, anything new
I should know about?

01:07.283 --> 01:10.552
The royal baby
smiled at the queen.

01:10.553 --> 01:12.654
I meant at the diner.

01:12.655 --> 01:14.155
Oh. I think we're maybe

01:14.156 --> 01:17.225
washing the forks now?
Let me check.

01:20.963 --> 01:22.964
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

01:24.633 --> 01:28.002
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

01:29.996 --> 01:33.884

01:34.084 --> 01:35.918
See, Max, one quick change,

01:35.919 --> 01:38.921
and we went from polyester and
pitiful to powerful and proud.

01:38.922 --> 01:41.256
Just like superman.

01:41.257 --> 01:42.958
Except that superman changed
in a phone booth,

01:42.959 --> 01:46.428
not a stall that says,
"for a good time, call Max."

01:46.429 --> 01:50.966
Well, if you have a problem
with it, why did you write it?

01:50.967 --> 01:53.102
'Cause I didn't have
enough eyeliner to write,

01:53.103 --> 01:56.705
"for an interesting time,
call Caroline."

01:58.141 --> 02:00.275
Look. Look, Earl, we're wearing

02:00.276 --> 02:01.844
our "Max's homemade cupcakes"
t-shirts again.

02:01.845 --> 02:03.045
See the logo?

02:03.046 --> 02:04.813
Well, actually, I try never

02:04.814 --> 02:08.717
to look you ladies
in the "chestal" area.

02:08.717 --> 02:11.820
It keeps things
on the up and up.

02:11.821 --> 02:14.857
Oh, Earl, you are
one in a million, literally,

02:14.858 --> 02:20.963
'cause 999,999 men have only
looked me in that area.

02:20.964 --> 02:26.091
Well, I got to go home. I've been
watching Dharma & Greg on Hulu.

02:26.092 --> 02:30.062
Oh, I missed so much
growing up in Korea.

02:30.063 --> 02:33.332
What, like puberty?

02:33.333 --> 02:35.084
Max, in my count
I'm average height.

02:35.085 --> 02:36.835
Max, in my country
I'm average height.

02:36.836 --> 02:38.570
And in my mind, I'm still rich,

02:38.571 --> 02:42.374
and my health care plan
isn't Flintstones chewables.

02:42.375 --> 02:44.743
So who wants to go in the back

02:44.744 --> 02:47.446
and see how amazing
our brand-new cupcake shop is?

02:47.447 --> 02:50.783
Bring down the enthusiasm,
Rachael Ray.

02:50.784 --> 02:52.217
Right,
we're not supposed to get

02:52.218 --> 02:54.086
all excited
about this opening tonight.

02:54.087 --> 02:56.622
Last time, we made a big deal,
and the shop didn't do so well.

02:56.623 --> 02:58.590
Ha!
That's like saying the people

02:58.591 --> 03:02.194
near the nuclear explosion
didn't do so well.

03:04.464 --> 03:08.200
Girls,
I am so proud of you two,

03:08.201 --> 03:10.569
getting back up on that horse.

03:10.570 --> 03:13.272
After my first jazz record
didn't sell,

03:13.273 --> 03:17.910
I turned to a life of drinks,
drugs, and loose women.

03:17.911 --> 03:21.146
Funny how sometimes
things just work out right.

03:25.718 --> 03:28.287
But how can you be opening
your cupcake window right now?

03:28.288 --> 03:30.456
- It's 2:00 A.M.!
- Our hours are 2:00 to 4:00.

03:30.457 --> 03:32.157
We're targeting
the "post bars" demographic.

03:32.158 --> 03:33.926
Drunk Williamsburg guys.

03:33.927 --> 03:35.727
That's my target
when I'm by myself

03:35.728 --> 03:38.163
and now my target
at the new shop.

03:38.164 --> 03:41.900
Funny how sometimes
things just work out right.

03:41.901 --> 03:44.470
We have no big expectations
about the opening tonight.

03:44.471 --> 03:45.571
It's a soft opening.

03:45.572 --> 03:46.905
What's the difference

03:46.906 --> 03:49.842
between a soft one
and a hard one?

03:51.644 --> 03:54.713
You want me to show him?

03:59.252 --> 04:01.153
Thanks, but we're cool.

04:01.154 --> 04:03.989
Seriously,
it won't take me a minute.

04:03.990 --> 04:05.791
It's fine, Oleg.

04:05.792 --> 04:10.295
Just so you know,
I'm already there.

04:10.296 --> 04:13.632
Get ready, this room's had
an amazing transformation.

04:13.633 --> 04:15.534
- Rachael Ray?
- I mean, it's fine, whatever.

04:15.535 --> 04:17.603
Han, before we go in,
close your eyes.

04:17.603 --> 04:18.837
I want you to get
the full effect.

04:18.838 --> 04:20.606
Yeah, and I want to trip you.

04:20.607 --> 04:22.441
- She's kidding.
- No, she's not.

04:22.442 --> 04:23.942
Yeah, I'm not.

04:23.943 --> 04:25.310
Han, I promise,
I won't let her trip you.

04:25.311 --> 04:27.106
Now, close your eyes.

04:33.047 --> 04:36.482
- What?
- Now, I thought she was going to hit me.

04:36.483 --> 04:39.986
- She was not.
- Yeah, I was.

04:39.987 --> 04:41.888
Okay, no more blind eye
bull crap.

04:41.889 --> 04:44.057
Just show me
the damn smelly back room.

04:44.058 --> 04:47.727
Let me turn off the lights
for a more dramatic impact.

04:52.566 --> 04:54.334
What? I didn't do anything.

04:54.335 --> 04:57.337
It was me.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.842
He now knows what hard is.

05:09.917 --> 05:12.018
I cannot believe my eyes.

05:12.019 --> 05:15.121
I felt the same way
when I first saw you.

05:15.122 --> 05:18.024
Original tan, original tile,
original too.

05:18.025 --> 05:19.292
What do you think, Oleg?

05:19.293 --> 05:21.260
Nice.

05:21.261 --> 05:23.963
"Nice"? All you got is "nice?"

05:23.964 --> 05:27.433
This place was like
Great Adventure for rats!

05:27.434 --> 05:29.302
They were waiting in line
to bite us.

05:29.303 --> 05:31.871
Caroline, show them
your bite marks.

05:31.872 --> 05:34.140
- I'd rather not.
- Nice?

05:34.141 --> 05:39.022
It used to smell like the place
poop comes to die.

05:39.023 --> 05:42.025
Or death comes to poop.

05:42.026 --> 05:43.960
And look what we did!
We created

05:43.961 --> 05:47.564
the greatest, coolest, chic-est
cupcake shop, and I love it!

05:47.565 --> 05:50.400
But you know, no enthusiasm.
Just soft opening.

05:50.401 --> 05:52.268
And, Han, this was all possible

05:52.269 --> 05:54.204
because you gave us
the space rent-free.

05:54.205 --> 05:56.940
Rent-free?
Now, refresh my memory.

05:56.941 --> 05:59.376
When exactly did I say
"rent-free?"

05:59.377 --> 06:03.279
On the 27th, 4:15 P.M.,
you said,

06:03.280 --> 06:05.915
"I don't care about that dump,
you can have it for free.

06:05.916 --> 06:09.386
Burn it to the ground,
for all I care."

06:09.387 --> 06:14.324
I knew learning English would
come back to bite me in the ass.

06:16.327 --> 06:19.262
Somebody's already knocking?
That's a really great sign, Max.

06:19.263 --> 06:21.164
Time to open.

06:25.636 --> 06:30.140
Look, girls, I'm blowing
this party horn for you.

06:30.141 --> 06:31.908
Thanks, Sofie, but we didn't
want to make a big deal,

06:31.909 --> 06:33.443
it's a soft opening.

06:33.444 --> 06:36.646
Oh, I love a soft opening.

06:39.061 --> 06:42.852
- Hello, Sophie.
- Oh, hello, Oleg.

06:42.853 --> 06:44.988
Sorry, Sofie, about this
uncomfortable meeting.

06:44.989 --> 06:46.690
If we had known
you were going to surprise us,

06:46.691 --> 06:48.525
- we wouldn't have invited Oleg.
- Yeah, I was there

06:48.526 --> 06:52.028
when you two broke up and
I'm still suffering from PTSD.

06:52.029 --> 06:55.365
"Post-traumatic Sophie drama."

06:55.366 --> 06:57.367
There's no drama.

06:57.368 --> 07:01.771
And the award
for the best drama goes to...

07:01.772 --> 07:03.973
Not us. Right, Oleg?

07:03.974 --> 07:06.042
Yes, we're friends now.

07:06.043 --> 07:08.044
See, girls, I cheated on her,

07:08.045 --> 07:10.480
so she smashed in
my car windows.

07:10.481 --> 07:12.282
And my apartment windows.

07:12.283 --> 07:15.018
And your stereo
and your flat screen.

07:15.019 --> 07:18.152
And my brother's flat screen
and his daughter's computer.

07:19.390 --> 07:23.860
Yeah, she surprised me.
She wasn't supposed to be home.

07:23.861 --> 07:27.363
We got it out of our systems.
Good night, friend.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.299
Good night, friend!

07:29.300 --> 07:31.534
And, Oleg?

07:42.246 --> 07:43.513
Wow.

07:43.514 --> 07:47.584
That is one lucky horn.

07:49.353 --> 07:51.421
Honey, look.
Look, some customers.

07:51.422 --> 07:53.423
Hey, cool guys!

07:53.424 --> 07:58.461
Come over here and eat something
from the girls' soft opening!

07:58.462 --> 08:00.636
That is so not
the way I would've gone,

08:00.637 --> 08:02.338
but I'll take it.

08:02.339 --> 08:03.373
Hello, hello.

08:03.374 --> 08:05.942
What have we got here?

08:05.943 --> 08:07.944
Welcome to Max'
homemade cupcakes.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.780
In England we call 'em
"fairy cakes."

08:10.781 --> 08:14.017
Fairy cakes? Damn it.

08:14.018 --> 08:17.353
Why are the hot ones
always gay?

08:18.656 --> 08:21.324
Here you go, darling,
give us the whole lot.

08:22.860 --> 08:24.794
Oh, my God!

08:24.795 --> 08:27.130
A black American Express card?

08:27.131 --> 08:31.468
I haven't held a black one
in my hands in years.

08:34.748 --> 08:38.250
I would've guessed you hadn't
held a black one ever.

08:38.275 --> 08:41.778
Sorry, it's our first night,
cash only.

08:43.447 --> 08:45.815
Oh, wow.
He is really out of it.

08:45.816 --> 08:49.285
- What is he on?
- Besides me later?

08:49.286 --> 08:52.889
Do not know, but am jealous.

08:54.225 --> 08:57.059
And now I'm really jealous.

08:57.060 --> 08:58.828
I'm sure he'll be fine.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.263
Oh, I'd say
he's more than fine.

09:00.264 --> 09:02.799
I'd say he's my next boyfriend.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.235
Ronald, mate. Wake up.

09:05.236 --> 09:06.770
He's not breathing.

09:06.771 --> 09:08.304
I can't wake him, call 911!

09:08.305 --> 09:10.106
Call 911!

09:10.107 --> 09:14.811
Let's all just calm down.
I have seen this happen a lot.

09:14.812 --> 09:18.515
One summer I had a part-time job,
I was a life guard at a crack house.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.216
- ***
- He'll come to in a second.

09:20.219 --> 09:21.746
He's dead.

09:21.747 --> 09:23.948
Called that wrong.

09:30.359 --> 09:32.827
Max, the guy who died
in front of our shop last night

09:32.828 --> 09:34.296
was a rock star.

09:34.297 --> 09:35.797
He used to date Kate Moss.

09:35.798 --> 09:37.866
No offense,
but dating Kate Moss

09:37.867 --> 09:40.568
is like a law in England.

09:40.569 --> 09:42.871
Everyone has to do it
when they turn 21.

09:42.872 --> 09:47.242
His name was Roland Glass,
and he has two gold records.

09:47.243 --> 09:48.910
I can't believe
I've never heard of him.

09:48.911 --> 09:50.478
I can.

09:50.479 --> 09:53.248
Your go-to jam
is the soundtrack from <i>Newsies.</i>

09:53.249 --> 09:57.185
Yesterday a rock star,
and today he's gone.

09:57.186 --> 10:00.055
You never know.
That's why I ordered us breakfast

10:00.056 --> 10:01.823
from the fancy breakfast place
on the corner.

10:01.824 --> 10:04.999
You ordered
from "Magna cum latte"?

10:05.000 --> 10:10.411
Everyday when I pass by it, I think
2 things. One, I wish I had a gun.

10:10.412 --> 10:13.915
And, two, someday I'm gonna
order breakfast to be delivered

10:13.916 --> 10:15.617
with one
of their fancy-ass croissants.

10:15.618 --> 10:17.848
Who knows, tonight
I could do too much heroin

10:17.849 --> 10:19.717
and die an unexpected death.

10:19.718 --> 10:22.920
But at least then I'd die
doing something my mother loved.

10:22.921 --> 10:24.788
You're right, Max.
You only live once.

10:24.789 --> 10:26.590
Yolo.

10:26.591 --> 10:31.662
And you only live till
the next time you say "yolo."

10:36.034 --> 10:37.935
Oh, no. More bad news.

10:37.936 --> 10:40.371
According to my Google alert
for Max's homemade cupcakes-

10:40.372 --> 10:42.273
you have a Google alert
for our business?

10:42.274 --> 10:45.376
I only have a Google alert
for "Oprah goes topless."

10:45.377 --> 10:47.378
I'm not saying
it's gonna happen,

10:47.379 --> 10:50.447
but I'm saying, if it does, I'm
gonna be the first one to know.

10:50.448 --> 10:54.618
Look, it's online that Roland
Glass died in front of our shop.

10:54.619 --> 10:58.122
And now my phone just died.
It's an epidemic.

10:58.123 --> 11:01.412
Oleg, what are you still doing
with the arrow from our shop?

11:01.413 --> 11:02.780
I thought that you said that was hung.

11:02.781 --> 11:05.880
No, I said I was hung.

11:05.881 --> 11:07.481
And I can't put it up now

11:07.482 --> 11:09.750
with that crowd of people
in front of your window.

11:09.751 --> 11:13.791
There are people
in front of our window?

11:13.792 --> 11:16.927
Dude, is this
where my man Roland died?

11:16.928 --> 11:18.829
Yeah, right over there.

11:18.830 --> 11:22.132
Then I'm gonna put this here,
next to Paddington bear.

11:22.133 --> 11:24.301
I caught this at his last concert.

11:24.302 --> 11:27.638
And I also caught this.

11:27.639 --> 11:30.674
So, like, what, dude?
He just dropped to the ground?

11:30.675 --> 11:33.644
Actually, he hit right here
first, smiled, then fell.

11:33.645 --> 11:37.314
He smiled? Dude.

11:37.315 --> 11:39.416
Max, can I see you over here?

11:39.417 --> 11:41.785
Sorry for your loss and dope hat.

11:41.786 --> 11:44.522
Thanks. I found it in a dumper.

11:44.523 --> 11:45.856
Max, what are you doing?

11:45.857 --> 11:47.591
Don't tell them
he hit our counter.

11:47.592 --> 11:49.860
We need to distance ourselves
from the entire event.

11:49.861 --> 11:52.162
This spells disaster
for our new business.

11:52.163 --> 11:55.166
Dude, can I get
three dozen cupcakes?

11:55.167 --> 11:57.869
Or it spells success.

11:57.870 --> 12:01.072
I have beaucoup friends coming
here for the midnight vigil.

12:01.073 --> 12:03.441
How much are your cupcakes?

12:03.442 --> 12:04.476
$7.

12:04.477 --> 12:06.177
That's a lot.

12:06.678 --> 12:10.681
Dude. Roland would've
wanted it that way.

12:17.059 --> 12:22.096
♪ Knock, knock,
knocking on heaven's door ♪

12:22.097 --> 12:25.166
And he hit right here
before he fell.

12:25.167 --> 12:29.837
And as he fell,
he looked up at me and smiled.

12:29.838 --> 12:33.207
Content. Peaceful.

12:33.208 --> 12:35.843
That'll be $7, cash only.

12:35.844 --> 12:37.945
Mira, can you break a 50?

12:37.946 --> 12:39.180
Max!

12:39.181 --> 12:42.116
Yeah, what do you need?

12:42.117 --> 12:43.551
Change for a 50.

12:43.552 --> 12:48.356
Got it. I mean, why, God, why?

sold out in here.

I need more cupcakes
from the kitchen.

12:58.967 --> 13:00.101
Got it. I'll come right in.

13:00.102 --> 13:01.235
Earl?

13:01.236 --> 13:03.404
Yo!

13:03.405 --> 13:06.374
Same split as before.
30¢ on every dollar you sell.

13:06.375 --> 13:08.643
What a waste.

13:08.644 --> 13:12.413
You know how much money
we could make if we sold pot?

13:12.414 --> 13:15.850
Oh, you want in on that too?
Same split.

13:17.552 --> 13:19.620
Oh, man,
that hippie patchouli smell

13:19.621 --> 13:21.722
is worse than the poop was.

13:21.723 --> 13:25.660
Han. These people are
in mourning. Show some respect.

13:25.661 --> 13:27.595
Me? Me show some respect?

13:27.596 --> 13:28.929
What will <i>you</i> two do next,

13:28.930 --> 13:30.097
sell cupcakes
at the diabetes wing

13:32.601 --> 13:34.769
How dare
you doubt my sincerity?

13:34.770 --> 13:36.604
I personally have shooed
a homeless man

13:36.605 --> 13:38.506
away from peeing
on that shrine twice.

13:38.507 --> 13:40.841
I don't care what
I may or may not have said

13:40.842 --> 13:42.943
on the 27th at 4:15 P.M.

13:42.944 --> 13:45.579
Your business is booming,
and now I want rent.

13:45.580 --> 13:48.582
No way, Han. That man
could've overdosed anywhere.

13:48.583 --> 13:51.752
But God made him overdose in
front of our window as a gift.

13:51.753 --> 13:54.955
And, yes, we are accepting that
gift because you only live once.

13:54.956 --> 13:57.291
Yolo.

13:57.292 --> 13:58.859
This isn't "yolo" it's "hodo".

13:58.860 --> 14:00.828
"He Only Died Once."

14:00.829 --> 14:04.131
I'm surprised you aren't
selling "hodo" t-shirts.

14:04.132 --> 14:05.966
How dare you again?

14:05.967 --> 14:07.835
We are simply providing
some comfort food

14:07.836 --> 14:09.637
to people who need comfort.

14:09.638 --> 14:13.374

it with the utmost respect.

14:20.782 --> 14:22.483

14:22.484 --> 14:25.619

because we made it beautiful.

14:28.590 --> 14:29.724
Yeah, show 'em your bite marks!

14:29.725 --> 14:31.025
Max, I'd rather not.

14:31.026 --> 14:33.027
You will pay me $200 a month,

14:33.028 --> 14:35.029
and there is nothing
you can do to change my mind!

14:35.030 --> 14:38.966

A rat bit her ass?

14:40.202 --> 14:42.136
Okay, 195.

14:42.137 --> 14:45.139
No rent, Han. That wasn't
the deal you made us.

14:45.140 --> 14:47.374
This is not personal,
it's business.

14:47.375 --> 14:50.010
I want a slice of grief pie!

14:50.011 --> 14:51.312
Show him your front bites!

14:51.313 --> 14:55.716
No! That's too personal.

14:55.717 --> 14:58.185
- Sorry you had to do that.
- So am I.

14:58.186 --> 15:01.655

- Don't lie to me.

15:03.892 --> 15:06.060
I think it's nice of us to add
our flowers to the others.

15:06.061 --> 15:07.528
Shows respect.

15:07.529 --> 15:09.663
You're acting
like you didn't steal them.

15:09.664 --> 15:11.699
Max, it's the thought
that counts.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.067
And I thought it'd be cheaper

15:13.068 --> 15:14.902
to pull them out
of someone's garden.

Wait, let me just
light a candle for my dignity.

16:06.555 --> 16:08.088
It died here too.

16:08.089 --> 16:11.559
Max, do you want
to be successful or not?

16:11.560 --> 16:13.994
Because if you do,
grab one of these poems

16:13.995 --> 16:16.730
that doesn't follow
any of the rules of poetry,

16:16.731 --> 16:19.834
and move it back
to the cupcake window.

16:19.835 --> 16:22.570
Because this is our death.

16:22.571 --> 16:25.005

you're being a little harsh.

16:28.109 --> 16:29.910
That is gold.

16:29.911 --> 16:34.481
Oops, knocked over a candle.
Ooh, small fire.

16:34.482 --> 16:36.584
Fire on the shoe.

16:36.585 --> 16:40.354
If I don't get this out, it's
gonna be my memorial service.

16:40.355 --> 16:42.022
Look, look.

16:42.023 --> 16:45.125

16:48.930 --> 16:51.432
Look, hippies, look!
Put down those bongs and look.

16:51.433 --> 16:53.334
They're moving the place
where a man died

16:53.335 --> 16:54.869
for their own financial gain!

16:54.870 --> 16:57.928
Hey, that's so not cool, man.

16:57.929 --> 16:59.563
Yeah, me on. Yeah, boo!

16:59.564 --> 17:03.533
He's the not cool one.
Yeah, look at him!

17:05.703 --> 17:08.305
Roland Glass died horrible death

17:08.306 --> 17:10.073

of our adorable cupcake window.

17:10.074 --> 17:11.708
See? "Horrible, adorable"?

17:11.709 --> 17:14.578
That rhyme just came
right off the top of my head.

17:14.579 --> 17:15.746
Hey! Hi.

17:15.747 --> 17:18.127
Hi. He knows!

17:18.127 --> 17:19.862
I told him to stop
peeing on the shrine

17:19.863 --> 17:21.364
when it was still over there!

17:21.365 --> 17:22.365
Isn't that right?

17:22.366 --> 17:24.133
Yep. That's the bitch.

17:24.134 --> 17:26.301
Yes! Yes! I'm the bitch!

17:26.303 --> 17:29.939
So not cool, dude.
Let's get him out of here.

17:32.442 --> 17:33.609
No! Stop!

17:33.610 --> 17:34.977
That's my wallet!

17:34.978 --> 17:37.980
Ooh, stop!
That's not my wallet.

17:46.123 --> 17:49.925
Even with those clothes
and that head.

17:49.926 --> 17:52.895
I mean, really. Are we
that desperate for success?

17:52.896 --> 17:55.364
We'd let Han be torn apart?

17:56.767 --> 17:58.134
I'm thinking.

17:58.135 --> 17:59.168
Caroline-

17:59.169 --> 18:03.795
Max, I'm <i>thinking.</i>

18:07.333 --> 18:11.136
Well, no one's knock, knock,
knocking on our door now.

18:11.137 --> 18:12.570
It's more dead out there

18:12.571 --> 18:14.406
than when there was
a dead guy out there.

18:14.407 --> 18:17.142
I'm having second thoughts
about how we behaved today.

18:17.143 --> 18:19.844
I mean, how could we
have let Han live?

18:19.845 --> 18:22.180
Hello.

18:22.181 --> 18:26.084
I brought you some rock star
pudding to say thank you.

18:26.085 --> 18:28.820
Oh, rock star pudding.
What's in it, pills?

18:28.821 --> 18:32.424
Broken dreams?
Tear-stained panties?

18:32.425 --> 18:34.459
Caroline?

18:34.460 --> 18:36.328
I'm not as easy as Max.

18:36.329 --> 18:39.431
Said every girl in
my seventh grade class.

18:39.432 --> 18:41.766
Look, I was wrong.

18:41.767 --> 18:43.034
No, Han, I was.

18:43.035 --> 18:44.669
We should pay rent.

18:44.670 --> 18:46.538
I wasn't talking
about the rent.

18:46.539 --> 18:50.241
Rent?
Who said anything about rent?

18:50.242 --> 18:51.609
I was wrong when I said

18:51.610 --> 18:53.511
it wasn't personal,
it was business.

18:53.512 --> 18:55.380
After Max stopped me
from being torn

18:55.381 --> 18:57.916
limb from limb
by the smelly hippies,

18:57.917 --> 19:01.586
I realized, with us,
it is mostly personal.

19:01.587 --> 19:03.254
And a little business.

19:03.255 --> 19:04.689
A little business?

19:04.690 --> 19:06.758
What other kind could you have?

19:06.759 --> 19:08.893
Max, let's not be hard on Han.

19:08.894 --> 19:10.795
He's giving us
this space rent-free.

19:10.796 --> 19:13.732
No one said "rent-free."

19:13.733 --> 19:16.034
I came up with a number
I think is fair.

19:16.035 --> 19:19.304
- $250,000.
- Yeah, sounds fair.

19:19.305 --> 19:22.774
I remembered that was
your original cupcake shop goal.

19:22.775 --> 19:26.578
So when you hit that amount,
we can talk rent.

19:26.579 --> 19:29.581
Han, that is so sweet.

19:29.582 --> 19:31.449
And I'm not gonna ruin it
by bringing up the fact

19:31.450 --> 19:33.985
that she just said
"hard on Han."

19:33.986 --> 19:37.021
Really, Han,
it's so, so generous.

19:37.022 --> 19:39.257
But I don't know
if we're comfortable with it...

19:39.258 --> 19:41.426
What if we offered you
a small piece of the business?

19:41.427 --> 19:45.330
I'll wait for the rent.
You two are good friends.

19:48.334 --> 19:49.667
A woman finally
offers Han a piece,

19:49.668 --> 19:52.370
and he turns it down.

19:55.174 --> 19:56.508
Max. Google alert.

19:56.509 --> 19:58.510
Oprah's topless?

19:58.511 --> 20:01.446
Max, let that go.
That's never gonna happen.

20:01.447 --> 20:03.815
Not with that attitude.

20:03.816 --> 20:06.684
No, the autopsy
says Roland Glass

20:06.685 --> 20:08.119
choked
on a Max's homemade cupcake.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.854
This is a disaster.

20:09.855 --> 20:13.758
Hey, where's your enthusiasm
now, Miss Rachael Ray?

20:13.759 --> 20:15.860
This place is the balls!

20:15.861 --> 20:17.695
And it's just a matter of time

20:17.696 --> 20:19.464
till those sicko hipsters
are lining up

20:19.465 --> 20:21.966
for "one of those cupcakes
that killed that dude".

20:21.967 --> 20:26.204
Open the window!
We're back, baby!

20:26.205 --> 20:28.540
But we can't count
on a guy dying every week.

20:28.541 --> 20:30.308
I mean, I have
a positive attitude,

20:30.309 --> 20:31.476
but that's too <i>pollyanna.</i>

20:31.477 --> 20:33.111
We don't have to.

20:33.112 --> 20:34.546
That's what's so great
about this window.

20:34.547 --> 20:36.214
Who knows what'll happen?

20:36.215 --> 20:38.016
Right, and we won't
have to chase business down

20:38.017 --> 20:39.951
because we'll be
right here on the street

20:39.952 --> 20:41.653
waiting for it to come to us.

20:41.654 --> 20:45.557
Max, I feel so good
about the possibilities.

20:45.558 --> 20:47.692
One night it could be
a black American express card,

20:47.693 --> 20:49.961
and the...

20:52.998 --> 20:55.300
Max, is it...

20:57.803 --> 21:01.005
Other nights,
it's a friendly little visit

21:01.006 --> 21:02.006
from our homeless guy.
