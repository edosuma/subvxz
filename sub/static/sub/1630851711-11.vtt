WEBVTT

00:05.413 --> 00:07.655
Nasty Girl Records!

00:10.172 --> 00:13.172
We not just a label.
We can be a full-service outfit.

00:13.172 --> 00:14.241
We're all gonna release

00:14.241 --> 00:16.896
our solo music
on Nasty Girl Records.

00:16.896 --> 00:18.827
We about to punch
the music business in they face.

00:20.379 --> 00:21.793
Sorry, Daddy.

00:21.793 --> 00:23.241
It makes
absolutely no sense

00:23.241 --> 00:25.241
to fall in love
with someone in 12 hours.

00:25.241 --> 00:27.000
I love you.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.482
Blood is not
a good enough reason

00:28.482 --> 00:30.724
to have someone who doesn't
treat you with respect.

00:30.724 --> 00:32.275
I keep
coming back to you,

00:32.275 --> 00:35.896
hoping that you will finally
accept me for who I am.

00:35.896 --> 00:38.517
I'm Jill Da Thrill,
the rapping lesbian

00:38.517 --> 00:40.655
who is worthy
of unconditional love,

00:40.655 --> 00:41.689
and if you won't
give it to me,

00:41.689 --> 00:42.931
then you can go to hell!

00:55.413 --> 00:57.586
Oh.
So, you're the new girl?

00:57.586 --> 00:59.241
Hi. I'm Ana.

00:59.241 --> 01:02.241
"Hi, I'm Ana."

01:02.241 --> 01:04.896
You just said what I said
in a different voice.

01:04.896 --> 01:06.689
T-That's cool.
I love impressions.

01:06.689 --> 01:08.482
You're gonna wish
you never came to this school.

01:09.551 --> 01:11.172
I wouldn't say that
if I were you.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.241
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do about it?

01:14.413 --> 01:16.103
Hmm.

01:16.103 --> 01:17.482
How about...

01:19.448 --> 01:22.344
With icy cool air
like a glacier breeze,

01:22.344 --> 01:24.758
I'm casting a spell
that'll make you freeze!

01:24.758 --> 01:26.758
Anacadabra!

01:29.034 --> 01:31.517
Yeah, that works.

01:49.034 --> 01:50.689
- Did you do it, Madison?!
- Madison, one smile?!

01:50.689 --> 01:51.586
Madison, are you leaving
the show?!

01:51.586 --> 01:53.068
Why'd you do it,
Madison?

01:53.068 --> 01:54.137
Did you
have a breakdown?

01:54.137 --> 01:55.241
Are you afraid
that they're gonna cancel

01:55.241 --> 01:56.758
"Anacadabra" now
that you've been arrested?

01:56.758 --> 01:58.379
What does your mom
have to say?

02:03.517 --> 02:04.896
What are you doing here?

02:04.896 --> 02:06.620
I bailed you out.
Why?

02:06.620 --> 02:09.758
Because I want to sign you
to Nasty Girl Records.

02:16.551 --> 02:19.620
I'm happy Thomas loves me
for my looks and not my money,

02:19.620 --> 02:22.827
because this bank account is
missing a whole lot of commas.

02:22.827 --> 02:25.241
Look, we poured everything
we have into the label,

02:25.241 --> 02:26.724
but it's all
gonna pay off.

02:26.724 --> 02:28.586
The launch was
a success.

02:28.586 --> 02:31.310
Lady Z's song just hit
six million streams.

02:31.310 --> 02:32.862
- What?!
- Yes!

02:32.862 --> 02:34.275
That is a great start,
y'all,

02:34.275 --> 02:35.862
but we have to keep
the momentum going.

02:35.862 --> 02:37.965
So while Muffin and Zadie
are working on their albums,

02:37.965 --> 02:40.137
I think we should
drop Valeria's early.

02:40.137 --> 02:41.586
What?

02:41.586 --> 02:43.482
No way. It's not ready.

02:43.482 --> 02:44.586
I thought you'd
be excited.

02:44.586 --> 02:46.241
I am. Kinda.

02:46.241 --> 02:47.241
But?

02:47.241 --> 02:48.862
I love
the music I'm making.

02:48.862 --> 02:50.379
You've come a long way
as an artist.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.758
It's one thing to make something
you're proud of.

02:52.758 --> 02:55.379
Releasing it to the world
is a whole nother thing.

02:55.379 --> 02:57.206
Look, don't trip.
You have a great album.

02:57.206 --> 02:58.344
It's all about
the launch.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.793
Which is why we were
able to land you

02:59.793 --> 03:01.344
a guest spot on
a Resonance record.

03:01.344 --> 03:03.137
I mean, he's the king
of the Latin charts right now.

03:03.137 --> 03:05.103
You're serious?
Resonance?

03:05.103 --> 03:06.413
El Gobernador?

03:06.413 --> 03:08.551
The only Puerto Rican I love
more than Resonance is --

03:08.551 --> 03:10.068
Yourself.

03:10.068 --> 03:11.896
Luis GuzmÃ¡n.
What?

03:11.896 --> 03:13.655
I like people who've had
little old-man faces

03:13.655 --> 03:15.137
for, like, ever.
Oh.

03:15.137 --> 03:16.413
This is amazing.

03:16.413 --> 03:20.862
Wow, to be recognized by
a Latin artist as a Latin artist

03:20.862 --> 03:22.103
means the world to me,

03:22.103 --> 03:24.724
and I never thought
I'd get to rap in Spanish.

03:24.724 --> 03:26.482
If you can win over
Resonance's fans,

03:26.482 --> 03:27.586
your album's a hit.

03:27.586 --> 03:29.965
Ooh, yes!

03:29.965 --> 03:32.586
Next, though,
we have to expand our roster.

03:32.586 --> 03:35.793
Yes, we need to sign someone
who can sell out arenas.

03:35.793 --> 03:38.344
Because you know touring is
where the real money is.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.310
We're never gonna sign
a star,

03:40.310 --> 03:43.965
but we can find raw talent
and forgotten talent

03:43.965 --> 03:45.620
and turn somebody
into a star.

03:45.620 --> 03:48.103
I'm helping with my money
and my talent.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.241
I already found me.

03:49.241 --> 03:51.448
I'll try to find someone.

03:51.448 --> 03:52.724
While you're acting
full-time?

03:52.724 --> 03:55.517
Look, I've pumped what money
I had into this business.

03:55.517 --> 03:58.000
I have to make
a living somehow.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.206
We'll be fine.

03:59.206 --> 04:02.517
Yep. Stars fall out of the sky
all the time.

04:08.517 --> 04:09.620
I don't need
your help.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.482
You keep saying that --
Because I mean it.

04:11.482 --> 04:14.344
Ana, wait.
What?!

04:20.448 --> 04:21.827
Line.

04:21.827 --> 04:23.827
"I don't want
to cast spells anymore.

04:23.827 --> 04:25.310
I want to be normal."

04:25.310 --> 04:26.724
Okay.
I'll give it to you again.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.068
Ana, wait.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.931
I don't want to be normal.
Oh, d-damn.

04:29.931 --> 04:31.034
Sorry, sorry.

04:31.034 --> 04:32.344
- Cut!
- That's a cut.

04:32.344 --> 04:33.206
My bad.
I'll -- I'll get it.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.862
It happens to all of us.

04:34.862 --> 04:37.758
My apologies, everyone.

04:37.758 --> 04:39.724
Maddi just didn't take
her Adderall this morning.

04:39.724 --> 04:41.482
Mom, I told you
I don't want to take it.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.551
Yes, and you want
to be professional.

04:43.551 --> 04:46.000
And I don't want you to keep
all of these people waiting.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.724
You are the face
of this franchise.

04:47.724 --> 04:50.034
Now take the pills,
sweetheart.

05:05.758 --> 05:08.275
Good!

05:08.275 --> 05:10.758
Let's take 10.
Start fresh.

05:23.137 --> 05:24.206
This is gonna be a hit!

05:24.206 --> 05:26.103
Yes!

05:26.103 --> 05:28.172
<i>Que bueno.</i>
Yes!

05:28.172 --> 05:31.551
Ah, thank E-Roc for
letting us use the NGR studio.

05:31.551 --> 05:33.896
This song is
exactly what I need

05:33.896 --> 05:35.379
to cross over into
the American market.

05:35.379 --> 05:36.793
I'm happy to get
the opportunity

05:36.793 --> 05:38.620
to connect
with my Puerto Rican roots!

05:38.620 --> 05:42.724
And I'm excited to get
the chance to rap in Spanish!

05:46.551 --> 05:47.655
What?

05:49.310 --> 05:52.896
It just doesn't sound like we're
on the same page, you know?

05:52.896 --> 05:54.241
I'm gonna do my thing

05:54.241 --> 05:57.000
and you kick your
sexy designer flow of yours

05:57.000 --> 05:59.482
that has all the white boys
Googling you

05:59.482 --> 06:00.827
after their wives
go to sleep.

06:00.827 --> 06:02.758
You want me
to rap in English?

06:02.758 --> 06:04.206
I want you
to rap how you rap.

06:04.206 --> 06:05.448
I speak Spanish.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.931
You do?
Yes!

06:06.931 --> 06:08.275
That's cool.
That's cool.

06:08.275 --> 06:11.965
I guess I thought of you more
like, uh, a gringa.

06:13.310 --> 06:15.620
I'm not even gonna dignify that
with a response.

06:15.620 --> 06:16.758
I didn't mean to --

06:16.758 --> 06:18.620
You did.
But it's cool.

06:18.620 --> 06:20.793
You're not the first person
to think that.

06:20.793 --> 06:22.862
And then I show them
what I'm about.

06:22.862 --> 06:24.758
And I'm about to show you
on this track

06:24.758 --> 06:26.827
when I kick my verse
in Spanish.

06:26.827 --> 06:29.379
I'm just saying,
give me a chance.

06:29.379 --> 06:31.413
Two powerful
Puerto Rican artists

06:31.413 --> 06:32.758
on the same track,

06:32.758 --> 06:34.896
rapping
in their native language.

06:34.896 --> 06:36.103
Legendary.

06:36.103 --> 06:37.965
Valeria, you can rap your verse
how I want

06:37.965 --> 06:39.310
or you can bounce.

06:39.310 --> 06:42.103
Hate to be blunt,
but it is what it is.

06:50.965 --> 06:53.724
Oh, hey.

06:53.724 --> 06:55.000
How's the scouting going?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.551
Finding talent
on SoundCloud

06:56.551 --> 06:58.206
is like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

06:58.206 --> 07:00.517
Nobody cares about
the art of hip-hop anymore.

07:00.517 --> 07:02.655
The Rakims,
the Tips, the Pacs?

07:02.655 --> 07:03.793
They don't exist.

07:03.793 --> 07:05.275
Reached out to
Rapsody's management

07:05.275 --> 07:07.137
to see if she was unhappy
with her situation.

07:07.137 --> 07:08.689
And?
They hung up on me,

07:08.689 --> 07:10.275
said they'd only be interested
in a collab

07:10.275 --> 07:12.068
if the Queens ever
got back together.

07:12.068 --> 07:14.034
I don't think Bree's ever
coming back from Costa Rica.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.965
You never know.

07:15.965 --> 07:18.206
But I'm happy she's happy.

07:18.206 --> 07:19.655
Yeah.

07:19.655 --> 07:20.655
Yeah.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.551
This is Naomi.

07:27.551 --> 07:30.172
Dean Brickerhoff,
this is a surprise.

07:31.551 --> 07:33.551
What about Jojo?

07:35.965 --> 07:38.344
You want to tell me why the dean
of your college is on my phone

07:38.344 --> 07:40.827
saying you haven't been
to school in over two months?

07:40.827 --> 07:41.931
Because I haven't.

07:42.827 --> 07:44.310
Okay, explain.

07:44.310 --> 07:45.620
I'm not feeling it.

07:45.620 --> 07:47.551
A little more
would help us.

07:47.551 --> 07:51.000
Jojo, you have fought so hard
to get into that school.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.827
Playing piano
at the highest level

07:52.827 --> 07:53.827
is your dream.

07:53.827 --> 07:55.551
Because it's all
I've ever known.

07:55.551 --> 07:57.793
I met some kids in L.A.
who haven't been cooped up

07:57.793 --> 07:59.724
playing classical music
all their lives,

07:59.724 --> 08:01.275
and we've been doing...

08:03.103 --> 08:03.931
...things.

08:03.931 --> 08:05.310
Drugs?

08:05.310 --> 08:07.000
Hip-hop.

08:08.517 --> 08:10.413
I want to be a rapper.

08:17.827 --> 08:22.655
You're not throwing away
your education to rap.
How can you talk down
about your own passion?

08:22.655 --> 08:24.241
'Cause we're talking
about you!

08:24.241 --> 08:26.551
I'd never been out of Georgia
when I came here.

08:26.551 --> 08:29.413
I'm learning a lot about myself,
figuring out who I am.

08:29.413 --> 08:31.827
That's good.
It is.

08:31.827 --> 08:34.724
Eric, you've been doing
this dad thing for a hot minute.

08:34.724 --> 08:36.379
Could you just stay
out of it?

08:40.896 --> 08:42.724
Maybe you're
just threatened,

08:42.724 --> 08:44.965
scared I might
be better than you.

08:44.965 --> 08:46.965
You need to get your priorities
straight.

08:46.965 --> 08:48.310
Seriously?

08:48.310 --> 08:51.827
You literally chose music
over your own daughter.

08:51.827 --> 08:54.413
I'm not gonna let you push
my buttons, Jojo.

08:54.413 --> 08:56.448
You are staying in school,
and that's it.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.448
Eric, back me up.

08:58.448 --> 08:59.931
So now I can speak?

09:03.379 --> 09:06.034
I'm an adult.
I don't need your permission.

09:06.034 --> 09:08.758
As long as you livin'
under my roof, you do.

09:08.758 --> 09:10.413
Cool.

09:12.965 --> 09:13.931
Jojo.

09:18.448 --> 09:19.758
Look,
we didn't go to college.

09:19.758 --> 09:21.448
We hustled.
And look at us now.

09:21.448 --> 09:23.275
Are we a team or what?
Of course.

09:23.275 --> 09:24.862
Then I need you
to have my back.

09:24.862 --> 09:26.172
I do.

09:26.172 --> 09:29.310
But I also
have opinions.

09:29.310 --> 09:32.000
And I want you to
have your opinions.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.862
But we have to look united
in front of our daughter, fam.

09:34.862 --> 09:37.620
I'm still getting the hang
of this whole thing.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.931
Alright? I have to be
her dad and not her friend.

09:39.931 --> 09:41.827
Let her cool down.
She'll be back.

09:41.827 --> 09:43.448
We'll figure it out.

09:47.275 --> 09:49.275
Team?

09:49.275 --> 09:51.000
Team.

09:55.103 --> 09:56.931
Madison:
I'm fine, Mom!

09:56.931 --> 09:58.482
Fine.

09:58.482 --> 10:00.344
It's Jill.

10:05.862 --> 10:07.275
Hey.

10:07.275 --> 10:09.000
You want to go
for a walk?

10:11.724 --> 10:13.586
Did you ask my mom?

10:16.517 --> 10:19.137
This is nice.
Thank you for this.

10:19.137 --> 10:20.827
It's nice
to be anywhere

10:20.827 --> 10:23.793
that's not in my trailer
or in front of a camera.

10:24.862 --> 10:27.896
Do you always have
to get permission

10:27.896 --> 10:29.689
from your mom
to take a walk?

10:29.689 --> 10:31.448
No. Kinda. Yeah.

10:31.448 --> 10:34.310
She likes to know
where I am.

10:34.310 --> 10:37.068
I try to see things
through her eyes.

10:37.068 --> 10:38.551
She wants
what's best for me.

10:38.551 --> 10:41.172
This character
is the network's cash cow.

10:41.172 --> 10:43.000
And your mom's.

10:45.793 --> 10:47.379
Look.

10:47.379 --> 10:49.206
I see how
she treats you.

10:49.206 --> 10:51.689
It's hard to deal
with controlling parents.

10:51.689 --> 10:54.586
It took me 40 years
to build up the courage

10:54.586 --> 10:56.344
to break free from mine.

10:56.344 --> 10:58.172
Yeah.

10:58.172 --> 11:01.896
I keep pitching changing up
the music in the show,

11:01.896 --> 11:04.793
like offering to write music
from my heart

11:04.793 --> 11:06.241
with a little bit
more edge.

11:06.241 --> 11:08.793
But everyone just wants
to keep me in this Ana box.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.034
You don't need
your mom's approval

11:11.034 --> 11:12.137
to be who you want to be.

11:12.137 --> 11:15.137
I actually do, though.
Literally.

11:15.137 --> 11:16.793
W-Wait, y-you're 21.

11:16.793 --> 11:18.206
You're an adult.
What do you mean?

11:18.206 --> 11:19.724
Nothing.

11:19.724 --> 11:21.655
I'm not supposed
to tell anyone.

11:21.655 --> 11:23.034
I barely know you.

11:23.034 --> 11:24.344
Sometimes those are
the only people

11:24.344 --> 11:26.758
you can tell things to.

11:28.103 --> 11:30.551
Have you ever heard
of a conservatorship?

11:37.827 --> 11:39.413
Yo, you walked out
on Resonance?

11:39.413 --> 11:41.931
Sounds bad
when you say it like that.

11:41.931 --> 11:43.620
He wanted me
to rap in English.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.034
You rap in English.

11:45.034 --> 11:46.482
But this is
a Resonance song.

11:46.482 --> 11:48.034
That you walked away from
when we're at

11:48.034 --> 11:50.310
an incredibly critical time
with this label.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.827
Girl, if you bend and breathe
one more time

11:52.827 --> 11:54.724
while I'm trying to talk to you,
we gonna have a problem.

11:54.724 --> 11:56.689
I'm not Jojo.

11:56.689 --> 11:59.655
She's not listening
to me either.

12:01.758 --> 12:04.206
What's up?

12:04.206 --> 12:07.000
Jojo wants
to be a rapper.

12:12.068 --> 12:13.379
Oh!

12:13.379 --> 12:15.172
You actually have a problem
with her wanting to do

12:15.172 --> 12:16.413
what you do
for a living.

12:16.413 --> 12:18.965
Okay, it sounds silly
when you say it like that,

12:18.965 --> 12:20.655
but she wants to drop
out of school.

12:20.655 --> 12:22.344
I mean, think about all
the stuff we've been through

12:22.344 --> 12:23.482
in this business, V.

12:23.482 --> 12:25.241
I mean, we took
our name from a man

12:25.241 --> 12:27.068
who was calling us
nasty little bitches.

12:27.068 --> 12:28.793
I mean, you think you would
be laid up with ass shots

12:28.793 --> 12:31.586
or poisoning bitches if you were
never in this music business?

12:31.586 --> 12:33.896
I'm probably
the wrong person to ask.

12:33.896 --> 12:35.000
Come on.
You know what I'm saying.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.310
I get it, but she's also
a grown woman...ish.

12:38.310 --> 12:40.413
You kinda got to
see where it goes.

12:40.413 --> 12:42.310
That's what Eric is thinking.
Then forget it.

12:42.310 --> 12:43.655
It's probably
the wrong approach.

12:45.586 --> 12:47.793
Look, I know things are
worse in this industry today

12:47.793 --> 12:49.241
than when we came out.

12:49.241 --> 12:51.103
I mean, do you see the comments
that people are making

12:51.103 --> 12:52.896
about young women
on the Internet?

12:52.896 --> 12:55.379
I just don't want Jojo
to have to live up

12:55.379 --> 12:57.310
to anybody else's
expectations.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.931
Then I guess you know why
I walked away from that song.

12:59.931 --> 13:02.344
People expect me to
be one thing -- a gringa.

13:02.344 --> 13:05.000
But I want to try something new.
He's not wrong.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.620
Looking back,
I have been presenting myself

13:07.620 --> 13:09.482
as a Sorta Rican.
Sorta Rican.

13:09.482 --> 13:11.827
All the tracks on my album
are in English.

13:11.827 --> 13:15.068
But recording it, I wanted
to try something different.

13:15.068 --> 13:17.413
I just didn't have
the courage to say so.

13:17.413 --> 13:18.689
Yeah.

13:18.689 --> 13:20.241
Well, we do have
a release date.

13:20.241 --> 13:21.620
We can't change that.

13:21.620 --> 13:23.103
It'll only take
a couple months.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.068
We might not even have a label
in a couple of months

13:25.068 --> 13:27.551
if we don't follow Lady Z's hit
with something big.

13:27.551 --> 13:29.758
But I hear you.
I do.

13:29.758 --> 13:32.448
But can we just save the Spanish
for your next album?

13:32.448 --> 13:35.000
And keep ignoring
who I want to be.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.379
Yeah, that's cool.

13:36.379 --> 13:39.275
You really have to make things
right with Resonance.

13:39.275 --> 13:41.793
Your album needs it.
Our label needs it.

13:43.275 --> 13:45.931
You want everybody to be free
of other people's expectations

13:45.931 --> 13:49.620
so long as they're a slave
to yours.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.206
All good.
You got it, captain.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.620
Could've answered
your phone.

14:11.620 --> 14:14.000
I needed a minute,
but I'm good.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.551
I came to talk to you,
and before you side with Mom,

14:17.551 --> 14:18.896
can you hear me out?

14:18.896 --> 14:20.413
Go for it.

14:24.068 --> 14:27.551
I love hip-hop,
and I'm good.

14:27.551 --> 14:29.689
I wouldn't drop out
if I wasn't.

14:29.689 --> 14:32.620
You know I had never heard
Mom rap until the BET Awards?

14:32.620 --> 14:35.172
I wrote my first verse
that night.

14:35.172 --> 14:37.517
I feel your passion.

14:37.517 --> 14:38.827
And I know that look.

14:38.827 --> 14:40.620
I saw it in Naomi's eyes
at that showcase

14:40.620 --> 14:42.896
in the Bronx
back in '93.

14:42.896 --> 14:44.965
But quitting school?

14:44.965 --> 14:46.344
I can't back you
on that.

14:46.344 --> 14:48.344
I'm doing it
regardless.

14:48.344 --> 14:50.206
But I would love
for you to be on board,

14:50.206 --> 14:54.034
because what you think,
it matters to me -- a lot.

14:56.034 --> 14:58.000
I gave your mom my word
that we'd be a team.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.793
All I'm asking is for you
to help me lay something down.

15:00.793 --> 15:02.344
I need to record
something real

15:02.344 --> 15:06.310
to know if I'm really
at the level I think I am.

15:06.310 --> 15:08.103
Please.

15:11.689 --> 15:13.137
Okay.

15:13.137 --> 15:14.862
But once you step in that booth,
you're not my daughter anymore.

15:14.862 --> 15:15.896
You're an artist.

15:15.896 --> 15:17.172
If it's fire,
the track is yours,

15:17.172 --> 15:18.758
but if it's wack,
I'm tossing it.

15:18.758 --> 15:20.655
Bet?
Bet.

15:20.655 --> 15:22.275
Alright.
Let's see what you got.

15:56.793 --> 15:59.379
Yes!

16:25.551 --> 16:26.689
Right?

16:27.793 --> 16:29.344
So...

16:29.344 --> 16:32.034
you want to sign
a teenybopper wizard chick?

16:32.034 --> 16:33.793
She's not
actually a wizard.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.482
Well, she was,
but now she's kind of a --

16:36.482 --> 16:38.103
Nah, it's corny.

16:38.103 --> 16:39.551
The <i>songs</i> are corny.

16:39.551 --> 16:41.655
Her persona is corny.
She's not.

16:41.655 --> 16:44.000
She's talented.
I hear her in rehearsals.

16:44.000 --> 16:44.793
Can she rap?

16:44.793 --> 16:46.000
She can sing.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.448
We're a hip-hop label.

16:47.448 --> 16:49.482
You said we would
never sign a star.

16:49.482 --> 16:53.172
Well, Madison has 11 million
followers on Instagram.

16:53.172 --> 16:54.689
Her fans are insane.

16:54.689 --> 16:58.034
I mean, she could be the next
Britney or Demi Lovato.

16:58.034 --> 17:00.551
She went on tour as Anacadabra
two years ago

17:00.551 --> 17:02.586
and sold out
every venue.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.379
As a corny-ass
wizard witch.

17:04.379 --> 17:05.931
Okay, look.

17:05.931 --> 17:08.034
I'm just saying,
it wouldn't hurt

17:08.034 --> 17:10.586
for us to diversify
our audience.

17:10.586 --> 17:13.206
She has a voice
and has something to say.

17:13.206 --> 17:14.379
And this label,

17:14.379 --> 17:16.103
the whole point
is to empower women.

17:16.103 --> 17:18.413
That's different than freeing
a woman from a conservatorship.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.896
It took 14 years
and a billion documentaries

17:20.896 --> 17:23.482
to free Britney!

17:23.482 --> 17:25.517
I stood by you

17:25.517 --> 17:28.068
when you were on your crusade
for Zadie.

17:28.068 --> 17:31.241
This is my stand
for Madison.

17:31.241 --> 17:33.689
I see what she's going through,
I understand it,

17:33.689 --> 17:35.000
and I want
to help her,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.068
and I think
she can help us.

17:38.137 --> 17:40.103
Okay, look,
what would it hurt

17:40.103 --> 17:42.620
to just bring her in
and see what she can do?

17:42.620 --> 17:47.000
She's a good, honest person
surrounded by bad people.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.689
Trust me.

17:48.689 --> 17:51.413
What did you say wizard
whatever girl's name was again?

17:51.413 --> 17:52.724
Madison Pierce.

17:52.724 --> 17:55.620
She just got her corny ass
arrested for shoplifting.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.000
Damn.

18:02.965 --> 18:08.448
I was hoping I'd get at least
a couple nights in there.
Wait a minute.
You got arrested on purpose?

18:08.448 --> 18:09.724
You really think
I would've walked out

18:09.724 --> 18:11.275
of Studio City Jewelers
with a necklace

18:11.275 --> 18:12.862
and expect to get
away with it?

18:12.862 --> 18:15.827
I wanted to get caught.

18:17.310 --> 18:20.137
In jail, they won't make me
take Adderall.

18:21.586 --> 18:22.931
You know,
she checks in on me

18:22.931 --> 18:24.586
like every hour,
even at night.

18:24.586 --> 18:27.413
She takes naps while I work
and stays up while I sleep

18:27.413 --> 18:30.172
just so she can make sure
I stay in my bed.

18:30.172 --> 18:33.586
I'm legally required to share
my location from my phone.

18:33.586 --> 18:36.724
My security's in the room
when I go to the gynecologist.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.965
But I knew in that cell,

18:38.965 --> 18:42.758
I'd at least get, like,
one good night of sleep.

18:42.758 --> 18:44.103
And...

18:44.103 --> 18:46.965
maybe they'd fire me
from "Anacadabra."

18:49.206 --> 18:50.206
Wow.

18:50.206 --> 18:52.068
Trish isn't
my mom anymore.

18:52.068 --> 18:54.379
The only way
to be free from her

18:54.379 --> 18:57.655
is to just stop
the money train.

18:57.655 --> 19:00.172
I know that sounds irrational
to normal people,

19:00.172 --> 19:04.448
but my life
isn't normal.

19:04.448 --> 19:07.482
You're gonna fight this,
and I'm gonna help you.

19:07.482 --> 19:08.517
How?

19:08.517 --> 19:09.827
You said you have
things to say?

19:09.827 --> 19:12.310
Well,
it's time to say them.

19:12.310 --> 19:15.896
Figuring out a way to make you
financially independent

19:15.896 --> 19:17.896
is the first step.

19:17.896 --> 19:21.241
Then we work on
the conservatorship.

19:32.620 --> 19:35.482
The Internet's
gonna go crazy!

19:35.482 --> 19:37.689
Mm, we got to play it
for your mom first.

19:37.689 --> 19:39.586
The world needs
to hear this.

19:39.586 --> 19:41.344
And they will.
Eventually.

19:41.344 --> 19:43.724
I'm already risking a lot
by helping you behind her back.

19:44.931 --> 19:47.620
Thanks for helping me.
This was really fun.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.965
We make a pretty good team,
huh?

19:49.965 --> 19:52.275
So, what's the plan?

19:52.275 --> 19:54.344
It's not a plan.
It's a deal.

19:54.344 --> 19:56.586
You go to school tomorrow,
and I'll speak to your mom.

19:56.586 --> 19:57.931
Deal.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.551
I got to take this.

20:04.172 --> 20:05.862
Yo.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.517
You still want
to sign this chick

20:23.517 --> 20:24.620
after she got arrested?

20:24.620 --> 20:26.103
She did it
on purpose.

20:26.103 --> 20:28.586
How is that an argument
that she's not crazy?

20:28.586 --> 20:30.413
She made a mistake.
She knows that, too.

20:30.413 --> 20:32.896
But we are more
than our mistakes.

20:32.896 --> 20:36.655
If you guys didn't believe that,
I wouldn't be in your lives.

20:36.655 --> 20:39.275
I'm pretty sure my mom's
gonna find me any minute.

20:39.275 --> 20:40.896
Y'all want to hear
what I've got to say,

20:40.896 --> 20:43.896
or just keep whispering
behind my back?

20:54.965 --> 20:57.931
Ooh.

21:01.310 --> 21:04.758
Yeah, girl.

21:16.965 --> 21:18.172
Yeah!

21:28.275 --> 21:30.448
Ow!

21:52.758 --> 21:54.275
Yes!

21:54.275 --> 21:55.034
Didn't I tell you?

21:55.034 --> 21:56.172
That was raw.

21:56.172 --> 21:58.448
That...was me.

21:58.448 --> 22:00.379
Ooh!
And Nasty Girl Records

22:00.379 --> 22:02.000
needs to be the one
who releases it.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.206
Oh!

22:03.206 --> 22:04.517
Police! Coming in.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.517
Mom!

22:08.517 --> 22:11.724
Maddi!

22:11.724 --> 22:13.931
I was so worried.

22:13.931 --> 22:15.551
Oh, thank God
I found you.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.862
Not enough to bail her out
from jail.

22:19.137 --> 22:21.275
Who the hell
do you think you are?

22:21.275 --> 22:23.413
Someone who isn't
Madison's mother

22:23.413 --> 22:26.482
who actually cares
about her well-being.

22:26.482 --> 22:28.000
Well, you're fired.

22:32.551 --> 22:36.206
We lost a day
of filming.
The studio is
worried sick about you.

22:36.206 --> 22:37.586
Are they really?

22:37.586 --> 22:40.068
Or were they just concerned
about their investment?

22:40.068 --> 22:42.206
You may be able
to do whatever you want to do

22:42.206 --> 22:44.793
in the context
of whatever this operation is,

22:44.793 --> 22:47.103
but Madison
has responsibilities,

22:47.103 --> 22:49.206
which requires her
to not get arrested

22:49.206 --> 22:51.448
and not sneak off
when I am taking a nap.

22:51.448 --> 22:52.896
The girl just
needed a break.

22:52.896 --> 22:54.896
And she was willing to go
to jail to get it.

22:54.896 --> 22:56.758
I'm not a parent,
but I would take that

22:56.758 --> 23:00.448
as confirmation of
the horrible job I was doing.

23:00.448 --> 23:02.034
I am a single mom

23:02.034 --> 23:04.758
who raised this young woman
in a trailer.

23:04.758 --> 23:07.517
We are now worth
$80 million

23:07.517 --> 23:09.310
and employ hundreds
of people.

23:09.310 --> 23:13.068
I think the job I've done
speaks for itself.

23:15.827 --> 23:17.103
She.

23:17.103 --> 23:18.758
What?

23:18.758 --> 23:21.172
<i>She</i> is worth
$80 million.

23:26.344 --> 23:28.965
According to the State
of California,

23:28.965 --> 23:31.586
I can have those nice policemen
come in here

23:31.586 --> 23:34.896
and arrest you
for kidnapping my ward.

23:34.896 --> 23:36.758
Do you want me
to do that?

23:38.551 --> 23:40.517
Hmm.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.310
Can I say goodbye?

23:44.310 --> 23:46.931
Jill bailed me out.

23:51.241 --> 23:52.275
Yeah.

23:52.275 --> 23:55.275
We'll be waiting for you
outside.

23:59.241 --> 24:00.379
Yo.

24:00.379 --> 24:02.241
How does this conservatorship
thing work?

24:02.241 --> 24:03.310
How do you get
out of it?

24:03.310 --> 24:04.689
I have to prove
I have the capacity

24:04.689 --> 24:05.965
to handle my daily life.

24:05.965 --> 24:07.310
So it's all up
to a judge?

24:07.310 --> 24:09.068
Unless my mom
steps down.

24:09.068 --> 24:12.137
Which she will never do.

24:12.137 --> 24:13.862
Look,
I need a new lawyer.

24:13.862 --> 24:15.620
My mom hired
the one I have now,

24:15.620 --> 24:17.724
and so he's loyal
to her.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.310
I was thinking,

24:19.310 --> 24:22.793
maybe we use my signing bonus
to hire someone new,

24:22.793 --> 24:24.655
someone who's not on
my mother's payroll?

24:24.655 --> 24:26.310
Look,
we're a collective.

24:26.310 --> 24:27.896
Nasty Girl Records
is set up

24:27.896 --> 24:29.206
to share profits
with the artists

24:29.206 --> 24:30.275
when you're --
You're broke.

24:30.275 --> 24:32.344
- We broke.
- Pretty much.

24:32.344 --> 24:34.896
Well,
I'll probably have

24:34.896 --> 24:37.689
Klonopin crushed up in my food
from now on.

24:37.689 --> 24:42.310
But it felt good to get
my song out there.

24:42.310 --> 24:44.103
Thank you, Jill.

24:49.517 --> 24:50.793
I'll pay.

24:52.379 --> 24:55.206
For your lawyer.
Not the label, me.

24:55.206 --> 24:57.931
But if I lose, I can't --
I can't pay you back.

24:57.931 --> 25:00.586
I'm willing
to take that risk.

25:03.137 --> 25:04.034
We good?

25:04.034 --> 25:05.137
I'm sorry
about the other day.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.379
I'm a professional,

25:06.379 --> 25:08.655
and it's an honor to be
on the song with you.

25:08.655 --> 25:09.758
It's all good.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.000
You wouldn't be
where you are

25:11.000 --> 25:12.551
if you weren't
an artist with ideas.

25:12.551 --> 25:15.000
Let's see what you got.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.344
Okay.

25:27.586 --> 25:29.482
I can handle all the ad-libs
in Spanish.

25:29.482 --> 25:31.724
Just...do your thing.

25:31.724 --> 25:33.551
Cool.
You got it.

25:34.724 --> 25:36.896
Let's go.

25:36.896 --> 25:39.275
Valeria's here.

25:40.137 --> 25:41.758
Here we go.
Here we go.

25:41.758 --> 25:43.896
Unh, unh.

26:37.758 --> 26:39.793
He dropped you
from the song?

26:39.793 --> 26:41.103
Come on,
you were supposed to fix things,

26:41.103 --> 26:42.103
not make them worse.

26:42.103 --> 26:43.689
It's not like
I did it on purpose.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.068
It was...

26:45.068 --> 26:47.206
what do you call it
with the dogs that get hungry?

26:47.206 --> 26:48.034
Pavlovian.

26:48.034 --> 26:49.310
That.
That.

26:49.310 --> 26:51.103
Well, this label
can't be a nonprofit

26:51.103 --> 26:53.793
and a humanitarian organization
all at the same damn time.

26:53.793 --> 26:55.551
We're all equal partners,
right?
Right.

26:55.551 --> 26:57.517
And we all get a vote,
right?
Right.

26:57.517 --> 26:59.448
Then why is it that
you get to call all the shots

26:59.448 --> 27:00.620
when I put in most
of the money?

27:00.620 --> 27:02.620
Because money is not
the most important thing.

27:02.620 --> 27:04.448
Do you hear
how hypocritical you sound

27:04.448 --> 27:05.931
from one sentence
to the next?

27:05.931 --> 27:07.689
You have a serious
chronic illness.

27:07.689 --> 27:08.931
Chill.

27:08.931 --> 27:10.965
Should I pick a side now
or listen to both of you?

27:10.965 --> 27:12.137
I'm done.
We good.

27:12.137 --> 27:15.689
Jill said y'all met
with Madison Pierce.

27:15.689 --> 27:17.241
That's a great idea.

27:17.241 --> 27:18.862
She could be the next
Christina Aguilera.

27:18.862 --> 27:20.482
Her mother has her
in a conservatorship.

27:20.482 --> 27:22.241
A conservatorship?

27:22.241 --> 27:24.137
Why do y'all have to make things
difficult difficult?

27:24.137 --> 27:25.448
Guess it's back
to SoundCloud

27:25.448 --> 27:27.551
looking for that needle
in a haystack.

27:30.517 --> 27:32.655
Oof.

27:32.655 --> 27:34.758
Mnh-mnh.

27:34.758 --> 27:36.275
Alright.

27:36.275 --> 27:38.758
This one's got to be good
since everybody's hatin' on it

27:38.758 --> 27:40.137
saying women can't rap?

27:48.241 --> 27:50.793
I mean, it's not perfect,
but it's got potential.

27:52.793 --> 27:55.965
Ooh, I think I just
got my needle --

27:55.965 --> 27:57.000
Wait.

27:57.000 --> 27:57.896
Is that...

27:57.896 --> 27:59.172
Jojo?

28:05.724 --> 28:08.862
Um...we should talk.

28:12.137 --> 28:13.965
Where does your mother
think you are now?

28:13.965 --> 28:16.413
Where my phone is,
in my trailer on set,

28:16.413 --> 28:17.896
like you suggested.
Good.

28:17.896 --> 28:19.689
Trish will fight you with
every tool in her arsenal

28:19.689 --> 28:21.275
because you are
the gravy train.

28:21.275 --> 28:22.344
So, if you want to win --

28:22.344 --> 28:24.034
She just wants
her life back.

28:26.413 --> 28:28.344
Then I need to
know everything.

28:28.344 --> 28:29.689
You need to give me
every piece of information

28:29.689 --> 28:31.034
that your mother
can weaponize.

28:31.034 --> 28:33.034
The only way I can win this
is if you're honest with me.

28:33.034 --> 28:34.724
I'm ready.

28:34.724 --> 28:37.034
I-I'll tell you
everything.

28:37.034 --> 28:39.241
My mom can't do anything worse
than she's already done.

28:39.241 --> 28:41.241
There's millions of dollars
on the table.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.896
You'd be surprised what people
are willing to do.

28:44.413 --> 28:47.172
And that,
coupled with her recent arrest,

28:47.172 --> 28:49.310
serves as proof that
my daughter continues

28:49.310 --> 28:51.758
to be unfit to make
these decisions.

28:51.758 --> 28:54.931
She's in a vulnerable state,
and left to her own devices,

28:54.931 --> 28:57.310
I fear
she'll end up broke,

28:57.310 --> 28:59.931
on the streets,
or worse.

28:59.931 --> 29:01.965
Alright.
Mr. Silva.

29:01.965 --> 29:04.241
Ms. Pierce would like to speak
on her behalf.

29:07.344 --> 29:09.931
With the information
Mr. Silva provided,

29:09.931 --> 29:11.482
you can see I've been working
for a decade,

29:11.482 --> 29:14.448
single-handedly supporting
both myself and my mother.

29:14.448 --> 29:17.068
So, I ask you,
if I'm competent enough

29:17.068 --> 29:19.896
to handle the high-stress
environment my job requires,

29:19.896 --> 29:22.000
while supporting
my family,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.551
why am I deemed incapable
of managing my own life?

29:24.551 --> 29:26.448
She constantly
forgets her lines,

29:26.448 --> 29:27.655
locks herself
in her trailer --

29:27.655 --> 29:28.862
Because
you provoke her.

29:28.862 --> 29:30.379
Please refrain
from interrupting.

29:30.379 --> 29:33.379
I believe my mother's decisions
are not in my best interests.

29:33.379 --> 29:35.620
They are solely
in <i>her</i> financial interests.

29:37.034 --> 29:39.000
I deserve to have a life,

29:39.000 --> 29:40.620
and this conservatorship

29:40.620 --> 29:43.137
is a profound miscarriage
of justice.

29:43.137 --> 29:45.586
The conservatorship
was granted three years ago

29:45.586 --> 29:47.310
because Madison was deemed

29:47.310 --> 29:49.965
mentally unfit
to handle her affairs,

29:49.965 --> 29:53.241
and her recent psych evals
suggests nothing troubling.

29:53.241 --> 29:55.379
She was <i>just</i> arrested
for shoplifting.

29:55.379 --> 29:57.482
Thousands of young people
shoplift

29:57.482 --> 29:59.862
and are not placed
in conservatorships.

30:07.862 --> 30:09.137
Mom.

30:09.137 --> 30:11.172
There's something you'd like
to add, Mrs. Pierce?

30:11.172 --> 30:13.310
Mom, no.
Please, no.

30:13.310 --> 30:15.965
I...

30:15.965 --> 30:18.862
was walking
past her room,

30:18.862 --> 30:21.827
and I saw the light on.

30:21.827 --> 30:25.896
I had a gun back then
for protection.

30:25.896 --> 30:28.827
And I didn't even know
that she knew I had it.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.896
But it -- it was...

30:32.896 --> 30:34.862
It was in her mouth,

30:34.862 --> 30:37.517
and she was about to...

30:39.103 --> 30:41.103
Oh, God.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.827
She needs
this conservatorship.

30:47.827 --> 30:49.620
She needs me
to protect her.

31:01.448 --> 31:06.379
Madison.
Why didn't you tell us?
Because you would've agreed
with my mom,

31:06.379 --> 31:07.862
and then we wouldn't be here
right now.

31:07.862 --> 31:09.448
No, no.

31:09.448 --> 31:12.000
I know now,
and I am still here.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.965
I never thought
she'd use it against me.

31:13.965 --> 31:15.827
She wouldn't even let me
tell my therapist

31:15.827 --> 31:18.000
for fear that it'd get out
and kill my career.

31:19.655 --> 31:21.000
I had just found out

31:21.000 --> 31:23.172
the conservatorship
was being extended.

31:23.172 --> 31:27.413
Another year of being told
what I could and couldn't do.

31:27.413 --> 31:29.896
It just seemed like
it was the only way out.

31:32.413 --> 31:35.413
I didn't want
to kill myself.

31:35.413 --> 31:39.689
I just wanted out
of this conservatorship.

31:40.862 --> 31:42.206
I know, I know.

31:42.206 --> 31:44.620
Look, your mother
needs to hear

31:44.620 --> 31:46.586
these words from you.
It won't matter.

31:46.586 --> 31:50.137
She needs to know how much
this is hurting her daughter.

31:54.137 --> 31:55.620
It's gonna be okay.

31:58.103 --> 32:00.172
"This bitch ain't
thicc, thicc,

32:00.172 --> 32:02.172
but def thicc enough
to get it."

32:02.172 --> 32:05.068
Yo, why are grown-ass men
discussing whether or not

32:05.068 --> 32:07.275
my daughter
has the right ass?

32:07.275 --> 32:09.551
This rapping misogyny
was exactly

32:09.551 --> 32:11.379
what I was trying
to protect Jojo from.

32:11.379 --> 32:13.586
But now because of you --
My daughter came to me

32:13.586 --> 32:15.172
saying she was passionate
about something.

32:15.172 --> 32:16.344
What was I
supposed to say?

32:16.344 --> 32:18.517
Discuss it with me.
That was the plan.

32:18.517 --> 32:20.655
I recorded it for her,
got her to go back to school --

32:20.655 --> 32:23.241
Yo, you can't parent
the way you do business.

32:23.241 --> 32:24.344
Always schemin'.

32:24.344 --> 32:26.275
Yo, can anyone ever
disagree with you

32:26.275 --> 32:27.551
without you turning them
into your enemy?

32:27.551 --> 32:30.379
Your plan didn't work, okay?
It blew up in your face.

32:30.379 --> 32:32.137
Now our daughter is online
getting dissed.

32:32.137 --> 32:33.448
You did that.

32:37.206 --> 32:39.206
How you holding up, baby?

32:39.206 --> 32:41.206
You know, you can't listen
to these people.

32:41.206 --> 32:43.206
Trolls will be trolls.

32:43.206 --> 32:44.931
It doesn't bother you
that they're talking

32:44.931 --> 32:46.862
about your body
and not your talent?

32:46.862 --> 32:48.275
You think I'm talented?

32:48.275 --> 32:49.551
Yes, but --

32:49.551 --> 32:50.965
That's what matters.

32:50.965 --> 32:53.896
I know this industry is
misogynistic and problematic.

32:53.896 --> 32:55.344
People are gonna comment
on my appearance,

32:55.344 --> 32:56.655
but I don't care
what they think.

32:56.655 --> 32:58.448
Look at Lizzo
and Billie Eilish.

32:58.448 --> 33:00.827
Good for them,
but they're not my daughters.

33:00.827 --> 33:02.413
Look, you have
a special opportunity

33:02.413 --> 33:03.689
in front of you
at Hellman,

33:03.689 --> 33:06.413
and yes, you got bars,
for sure,

33:06.413 --> 33:08.103
but can that be enough
right now?

33:08.103 --> 33:10.586
I mean, this will be here
for you once you graduate,

33:10.586 --> 33:12.172
and if it's what
you want to do after that,

33:12.172 --> 33:14.000
I will support you.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.586
No words.

33:15.586 --> 33:17.448
Just love.

33:17.448 --> 33:19.448
My mind's made up.

33:31.482 --> 33:32.931
Is she okay?

33:32.931 --> 33:35.275
She can be.

33:35.275 --> 33:36.517
That's up to you.

33:36.517 --> 33:38.620
Look, I-I said what I said
for her own good.

33:38.620 --> 33:40.000
I get that you
think that.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.655
Look, I know that what I do
seems excessive.

33:43.655 --> 33:46.034
Everything I have ever done
has been for my daughter.

33:46.034 --> 33:48.241
When she said
she wanted to be a star,

33:48.241 --> 33:50.620
I moved us across
the country.

33:50.620 --> 33:54.448
And then she actually made it.
I-In Hollywood.

33:54.448 --> 33:57.068
I mean, do you know
how many odds we have beaten?

33:57.068 --> 34:01.241
So, when she had
her breakdown...

34:01.241 --> 34:03.241
I helped her,

34:03.241 --> 34:05.034
and it is because of me

34:05.034 --> 34:08.379
that she has turned
her life around.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.344
You do not know
what it is like

34:10.344 --> 34:12.413
to walk in on your child
like that about to --

34:12.413 --> 34:14.517
I don't.

34:14.517 --> 34:17.034
But I do know what it's like
to get to that point

34:17.034 --> 34:19.896
where you feel like nothing's
ever gonna change,

34:19.896 --> 34:23.586
where you just don't care
what happens.

34:23.586 --> 34:27.241
You don't want to feel
trapped anymore.

34:27.241 --> 34:29.413
What if...

34:29.413 --> 34:32.758
she pulled
that trigger?

34:32.758 --> 34:35.413
You think
you're protecting her,

34:35.413 --> 34:36.896
but you're not.

34:36.896 --> 34:40.517
You're trying to control her
to protect yourself.

34:40.517 --> 34:44.344
But trust me,
if you don't let her go,

34:44.344 --> 34:48.413
you really will lose her --
for good.

34:49.931 --> 34:51.931
Talk to your daughter.

34:51.931 --> 34:54.275
Listen to her.

34:57.448 --> 35:00.758
Um, I'll let you two
talk alone.

35:11.137 --> 35:13.068
I can't believe that
I can't believe

35:13.068 --> 35:15.482
Trish would spill that kind of
tea on her own daughter

35:15.482 --> 35:18.137
just to keep the conservatorship
alive.
I know.

35:18.137 --> 35:20.448
The attempted suicide
is too damning,

35:20.448 --> 35:21.965
and the judge isn't
gonna reverse it,

35:21.965 --> 35:25.000
so hopefully Madison
gets through to Trish.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.137
Feels unlikely.

35:26.137 --> 35:27.965
Hey.

35:29.517 --> 35:31.034
What happened?

35:32.344 --> 35:34.344
She...

35:35.517 --> 35:37.137
My mom's letting me go.

35:37.137 --> 35:39.310
What?

35:39.310 --> 35:40.965
Yeah.

35:40.965 --> 35:43.000
And I want to make music
with you guys,

35:43.000 --> 35:44.482
if the offer
still stands.

35:44.482 --> 35:46.137
Yes!
Okay, then!

35:46.137 --> 35:47.344
Come on with somebody!

35:47.344 --> 35:49.000
We want to hear that!

35:53.689 --> 35:56.379
Madison said
she'd be here an hour ago.
We should've
picked her up.

35:56.379 --> 35:58.206
She'll be here!

35:59.517 --> 36:01.586
See?

36:01.586 --> 36:03.689
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:03.689 --> 36:06.655
First taste of freedom
in three years.

36:06.655 --> 36:08.620
How do you feel?

36:08.620 --> 36:10.758
Oh, great. Good.

36:10.758 --> 36:13.413
That doesn't sound good.

36:13.413 --> 36:16.000
I don't like
disappointing people.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.241
Who are you disappointing?

36:18.241 --> 36:21.896
Word got out
I was free of my mom,

36:21.896 --> 36:23.448
free
of my conservatorship,

36:23.448 --> 36:26.000
and -- and offers started
rolling in.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
There was a bidding war.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.310
Universal offered me
$5 million up front.

36:31.310 --> 36:33.517
Aren't they the people
who produce your show?

36:33.517 --> 36:35.275
They say if I give them
one more Ana album,

36:35.275 --> 36:36.724
then I'll be free
to do what I want.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.793
I can't pass up
that kind of money.

36:45.137 --> 36:47.655
I appreciate everything
you did for me, Jill,

36:47.655 --> 36:49.379
and I will pay you back.
Don't worry about it.

36:51.724 --> 36:53.448
Okay.

36:55.103 --> 36:56.517
That's it, I guess.

36:56.517 --> 36:59.206
Take care of yourself,
Madison.

37:01.137 --> 37:02.448
Come on, Madison.

37:11.448 --> 37:14.275
You okay?

37:14.275 --> 37:17.965
I want to pretend that I don't
know where Madison's headed,

37:17.965 --> 37:19.448
but I do.

37:19.448 --> 37:21.482
I mean, y'all can't
save everyone.

37:21.482 --> 37:22.517
You tried.

37:24.206 --> 37:25.689
I lost Madison,

37:25.689 --> 37:27.758
and the label
is no further ahead

37:27.758 --> 37:30.000
than it was before
I went after her.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.758
I was the reason
we broke up in the past.

37:33.758 --> 37:35.413
But I won't be
the reason today.

37:36.793 --> 37:38.655
You said something to me
in the booth

37:38.655 --> 37:40.310
while we were recording.

37:40.310 --> 37:43.827
You said, we're both artists
with opinions.

37:43.827 --> 37:45.931
And that made me want to rap
in Spanish

37:45.931 --> 37:49.034
because that's what
I want to express right now.

37:49.034 --> 37:52.000
And I don't care if being a
gringa is better for my career.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.965
And I didn't really care
that you dropped me

37:53.965 --> 37:56.793
from a song that would've been
a hit, because it's ultimately

37:56.793 --> 37:58.931
not something
I would've been proud of.

37:58.931 --> 38:02.482
I am proud of who I am.

38:02.482 --> 38:03.965
And where I'm going.

38:03.965 --> 38:05.482
And I know you're
an artist, too,

38:05.482 --> 38:08.241
and I don't expect you to
change your mind on your song.

38:08.241 --> 38:11.034
But if you could see
in my heart

38:11.034 --> 38:15.275
that this is genuinely who I am
and what I want...

38:16.724 --> 38:18.448
...I think you'll want
to help me

38:18.448 --> 38:22.724
become that artist
that I want to be.

38:23.689 --> 38:25.689
I'm listening.

38:31.931 --> 38:33.448
Mm!

38:33.448 --> 38:34.827
Yeah.

38:34.827 --> 38:35.827
Ooh.

38:40.655 --> 38:42.448
- Whoo!
- That's fire.

38:42.448 --> 38:43.551
I'm not on his song,

38:43.551 --> 38:45.551
but he did produce
my Latin song.

38:45.551 --> 38:47.310
I mean, this definitely
broadens our reach

38:47.310 --> 38:49.068
like we were
talking about.

38:49.068 --> 38:50.793
I think the album
is ready.

38:50.793 --> 38:52.862
And I want this one
to be my first single.

38:52.862 --> 38:55.000
Okay.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.620
Let's ride with it!
Congrats, girl!

38:57.620 --> 38:59.586
So, what's next?

38:59.586 --> 39:03.034
Well, I have an idea
on who we should sign.

39:15.724 --> 39:17.862
I'm not coming home
if that's why you're here.

39:17.862 --> 39:19.517
It's not.

39:19.517 --> 39:22.103
Look

39:22.103 --> 39:25.068
it's like I blinked
and 10 years passed by.

39:25.068 --> 39:27.517
Suddenly my baby
is a grown woman,

39:27.517 --> 39:29.206
and my eyes
can see that,

39:29.206 --> 39:32.137
but my brain is still
trying to catch up.

39:32.137 --> 39:34.517
So I'm sorry if I haven't
been listening to you

39:34.517 --> 39:37.344
and treating you like the adult
that you are.

39:37.344 --> 39:40.379
I'm trying,
I'm learning,

39:40.379 --> 39:42.103
and I'm growing,
just like you are.

39:42.103 --> 39:45.034
I can do this.
I can rap.

39:45.034 --> 39:47.965
I know, and I love it
that you believe in yourself,

39:47.965 --> 39:49.310
'cause most people don't.

39:49.310 --> 39:51.965
And that's what you need
to succeed in this business.

39:51.965 --> 39:54.000
Otherwise,
you won't survive it.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.896
So if you want to drop
out of Hellman...

39:56.896 --> 39:58.965
it's your decision
to make.

40:04.620 --> 40:06.103
What's the catch?

40:06.103 --> 40:08.793
There is no catch.

40:08.793 --> 40:10.310
But I do have an offer.

40:10.310 --> 40:12.586
So, I've been on SoundCloud
all week,

40:12.586 --> 40:15.172
and most of the content
out there is trash,

40:15.172 --> 40:17.172
especially compared
to your track.

40:17.172 --> 40:19.241
And I'm not just saying that
because I'm your mama.

40:19.241 --> 40:21.827
I'm saying this as someone
who has done it.

40:21.827 --> 40:24.379
You're very gifted,

40:24.379 --> 40:27.655
and Nasty Girl Records
would be so lucky to have you.

40:30.103 --> 40:31.689
I feel like
there's a catch.

40:31.689 --> 40:34.344
Jojo, I can't force you
to stay in school,

40:34.344 --> 40:36.620
but I also know that you have
an incredible opportunity

40:36.620 --> 40:37.965
in front of you
at Hellman.

40:37.965 --> 40:40.413
If you drop out
and you want to rap,

40:40.413 --> 40:42.448
I'm not gonna let you do it
any other place

40:42.448 --> 40:44.206
than under my wing.

40:44.206 --> 40:47.344
But what I want to offer you
is an opportunity to do both.

40:47.344 --> 40:50.655
Stay in school,
get your degree...

40:50.655 --> 40:52.620
and make your music
while doing it.

40:52.620 --> 40:55.586
And I know you haven't fallen
out of love with piano.

40:55.586 --> 40:57.103
I saw you
at that audition.

40:58.758 --> 40:59.965
J's killin' it.

41:01.448 --> 41:02.793
I kinda miss it.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.000
It's quiet.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.655
I could do it alone.

41:05.655 --> 41:08.896
I want to give you
the opportunity to do both.

41:08.896 --> 41:10.586
That's what
I'm giving you.

41:16.241 --> 41:17.965
Now, does that mean...

41:17.965 --> 41:19.551
I want to do both.

41:20.551 --> 41:22.379
Welcome
to Nasty Girl Records.

41:22.379 --> 41:24.034
Do I get an advance?

41:24.034 --> 41:25.137
We broke as hell.

41:25.137 --> 41:27.275
Of course.

41:28.448 --> 41:30.655
So, should we go home?

41:30.655 --> 41:33.137
Yes, baby.
Let's go home.

41:39.620 --> 41:41.172
And cut!

41:53.862 --> 41:58.137
Poof, the power inside me

42:23.344 --> 42:25.241
