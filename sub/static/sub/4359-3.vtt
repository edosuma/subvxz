[Horn honks]

00:03.480 --> 00:04.920
I'm Alex Mack.

00:04.920 --> 00:05.960
I was just an average kid

00:05.960 --> 00:08.600
until an accident
changed my life,

00:08.600 --> 00:10.280
and since then,
nothing's been the same.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.440
My best friend, Ray,
thinks it's cool.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.920
My sister, Annie,
thinks I'm a science project.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.280
I can't let anyone else know.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.320
Not even my parents.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.320
I know the Chemical Plant
wants to find me

00:52.320 --> 00:54.560
and turn me into
some experiment,

00:54.560 --> 00:55.320
but you know something?

00:55.320 --> 00:57.720
I guess I'm not
so average anymore.

01:06.120 --> 01:06.680
Hear me out.

01:06.680 --> 01:09.440
Ultimate frisbee is bound
to be an olympic event

01:09.440 --> 01:10.600
by the time we're 20.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.280
You still trying
to get a team together?

01:12.280 --> 01:15.440
Yeah, if I can find
people who are interested.

01:15.440 --> 01:16.280
I can't even find people

01:16.280 --> 01:17.360
even heard of it
in this town.

01:17.360 --> 01:20.840
I'd play, but why do frisbees
have to be made out of plastic?

01:20.840 --> 01:22.240
Why not wood?

01:22.240 --> 01:23.160
"Ultimate"?

01:23.160 --> 01:25.400
Even the name sounds dangerous.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.360
I once got hit
in the side of the head

01:27.360 --> 01:27.880
with a frisbee,

01:27.880 --> 01:30.320
and I was only playing catch
with my mother.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.920
Robyn, to you,

01:31.920 --> 01:33.640
walking to school is dangerous.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.720
I know.
It is.

01:35.720 --> 01:36.200
[Scoffs]

01:36.200 --> 01:38.080
Man, I grew up
in the wrong town.

01:38.080 --> 01:38.680
People around here

01:38.680 --> 01:41.400
are 20 years behind
the rest of the world.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.200
20 years?

01:42.200 --> 01:42.880
You're being nice.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.920
I say we're
a billion years behind.

01:44.920 --> 01:45.920
[Laughs]

01:45.920 --> 01:47.200
Yeah.

[Grunts]

02:08.199 --> 02:09.600
Guy smells like a wet dog.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.720
That's insulting to wet dogs.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.800
I didn't know anyone
was moving in.

02:19.800 --> 02:20.560
We should have warned them

02:20.560 --> 02:23.280
about what they're
getting themselves into.

02:27.720 --> 02:28.960
Clang!

02:29.760 --> 02:30.640
Would you look at that?

02:30.640 --> 02:32.680
People think anything
will biodegrade.

02:32.680 --> 02:35.760
Nicole, you don't get it.

02:35.760 --> 02:37.600
People just don't care.

03:11.720 --> 03:15.200
[Indistinct conversation]

03:29.320 --> 03:31.520
Othello gets so jealous
of Desdemona,

03:31.520 --> 03:32.160
he goes nuts.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.520
That's not very realistic.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.000
Yes, it is!

03:35.000 --> 03:37.320
Jealousy is like a disease.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.200
It can suck at your soul

03:39.200 --> 03:40.840
until all you can think about

03:40.840 --> 03:43.960
is sweet, sweet revenge.

03:43.960 --> 03:44.800
Uh-huh.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.440
Where's Raymond?

03:48.440 --> 03:51.320
Oh, he's trying
to drum up interest in--

03:52.080 --> 03:53.400
Let me guess.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.040
Hear me out.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.320
Ultimate frisbee
is a perfect mix

03:58.320 --> 04:01.160
of football,
soccer, and frisbee.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.600
So what do you say?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.960
Hey, I only have
a few spots left--

04:05.960 --> 04:06.800
Hey, dorks!

04:06.800 --> 04:08.920
This is our table!
Yeah!

04:08.920 --> 04:10.160
Sorry, Toby.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.240
You should watch
where you're going.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.960
I said sorry.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.320
Hey.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.959
Didn't you hear me?

04:18.959 --> 04:21.440
I said this is our table.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.280
[laughter]

04:25.280 --> 04:26.000
Some of the dogs I walk

04:26.000 --> 04:27.600
have better manners
than that guy.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.680
Doesn't Mrs. Ward know

04:28.680 --> 04:30.720
that her son's the most
vicious bully in school?

04:30.720 --> 04:34.240
No, and I think everyone's
afraid to tell her.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.200
So have you gotten anyone
for your ultimate team yet?

05:09.200 --> 05:10.040
How could I?

05:10.040 --> 05:11.640
Robyn's been running around
telling everyone

05:11.640 --> 05:14.960
that ultimate players
have a high mortality rate.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.080
Hey, come on.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.200
Your chance to practice

05:20.200 --> 05:22.920
with a future
ultimate world champion.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.920
Hey, let's see your toss.

[Drumroll]

05:30.720 --> 05:31.320
[Sighs]

05:31.320 --> 05:33.280
Whoa, you sure could
use some practice.

05:35.240 --> 05:35.800
I can't.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.560
I'm going to the mall
with Robyn.

05:37.560 --> 05:38.960
Want to come?

05:38.960 --> 05:40.200
The mall?

05:40.200 --> 05:41.360
Again?
God.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.800
We've only got two hours.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.960
I'm walking the Boxermans'
Corgis at 5:00.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.040
Or is it the Corgermans' Boxers?

05:48.040 --> 05:50.760
Whatever.
I've got a business to run.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.280
You coming, Ray?

05:52.280 --> 05:55.200
It's not like you'd have
anything better to do.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.560
Hey, was that
a big-screen TV we saw earlier?

06:14.560 --> 06:16.480
Yeah, my dad's
an electronics fanatic.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.760
You should see some of the other
cool stuff we have.

06:18.760 --> 06:19.680
Well, I'm Ray Alvarado,

06:19.680 --> 06:22.320
and this is Alex,
and that's Robyn.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.240
[Laughs]

06:29.240 --> 06:29.920
How'd you do that?

06:29.920 --> 06:32.080
Haven't you ever seen
one of these?

06:32.080 --> 06:32.680
Guess not.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.800
You don't get out much, do you?

06:36.080 --> 06:36.840
Where you from?

06:36.840 --> 06:39.040
Cincinnati, the queen city.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.920
They call it that?

06:40.920 --> 06:42.320
No, I just made it up.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.560
Duh.

06:44.000 --> 06:44.840
Oh, cool, whose frisbee?

06:44.840 --> 06:47.840
I was in an Ultimate League
in Cincinnati.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.320
Finally, somebody!

06:49.320 --> 06:50.880
You got to show me how to play.

06:50.880 --> 06:51.960
What are you doing?

06:51.960 --> 06:52.960
I'll show you right now.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.240
What about the mall?

06:54.240 --> 06:55.440
The mall?

06:55.440 --> 06:56.120
I don't know, Ray.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.080
Personally, I'm not
that big into shopping.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.320
You guys don't mind, right?

06:59.320 --> 07:00.200
Course they don't.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.480
Course not.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.440
Later, you guys.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.000
Hey, Ray, over here.

07:05.000 --> 07:05.520
Come on, Alex.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.280
The Corgis start snapping
if I'm late.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.960
So you, like,
hang out with those two?

07:11.960 --> 07:14.800
No--I mean,
Alex lives next door.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.200
Mm-hmm.
No.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.000
Sure, I know.

07:17.000 --> 07:17.680
You grow up with them,

07:17.680 --> 07:20.160
You're kind of stuck
with them, right?

07:26.160 --> 07:29.240
Mrs. Pounder tells me
you skipped art class yesterday.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.480
I'm sure she's
exaggerating the problem,

07:31.480 --> 07:33.560
but even so,
that's not a good example

07:33.560 --> 07:37.520
to set for the other students,
is it, Tobias?

07:37.520 --> 07:39.120
No, Mom.
I'm sorry.

07:39.120 --> 07:40.600
It won't happen again.

07:40.600 --> 07:41.320
Good.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.320
Now get to class,

07:42.320 --> 07:44.160
and don't let me hear any more

07:44.160 --> 07:45.440
of those kinds of reports.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.200
[Indistinct conversation]

07:49.440 --> 07:50.080
It must be tough,

07:50.080 --> 07:53.160
your mom being
a teacher and all.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.200
Shut up.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.520
Mr. Sunshine.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.120

Critics feel that the most
intriguing character

08:04.160 --> 08:06.280
<i>in Shakespeare's Othello</i>

08:06.280 --> 08:09.880
is iago,
his mean little villain.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.080
Yes?

08:16.240 --> 08:19.000
Class, this is Louis Driscoll.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.320
Louis is new here
at Atron Junior High School,

08:21.320 --> 08:24.640
so let's give him
a rousing welcome.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.120
Hello, Louis!

08:27.120 --> 08:28.200
[Mumbling]
Hello, Louis.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.000
[Mumbling]
Hello, Lou...

08:31.320 --> 08:34.280
Uh, Louis, you sit here
by Nicole.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.000
All right, class,
everybody take out your books.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.440
You were supposed to read
act one last night.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.120
<i> I didn't even read page one.</i>

It doesn't get good
until they leave Venice.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.240
[Thinking]
Louis looked and acted

08:49.240 --> 08:50.200
totally different yesterday.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.200
Maybe he's not
as obnoxious as we thought.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.040
Robyn just told me
she thinks he's kind of cute.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.040
I don't.
Alex.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.840
[Whispers]
Nicole.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.280
What have you
got there, Louis?

09:20.280 --> 09:23.280
It's a note, Mrs. Ward.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.600
Do you think I should
read it to the class?

09:25.600 --> 09:29.600
That's quite enough, Louis.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.000
[Laughter]

09:35.000 --> 09:37.600
This is a classroom,

09:37.600 --> 09:40.720
not a comedy club.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.160
Miss Mack,

09:43.160 --> 09:46.200
I'll need to see you
after class.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.160
Busted!

09:47.160 --> 09:49.040
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.440
Man, is she
a nightmare or what?

09:57.440 --> 09:59.560
We're talking about
Mrs. Ward, aren't we?

09:59.560 --> 10:02.640
I bet "nightmare"
doesn't even describe it.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.880
[Sighs]

10:11.880 --> 10:12.600
Oh, my gosh.

10:12.600 --> 10:13.560
Both:
What happened?

10:13.560 --> 10:14.520
If she catches me again,

10:14.520 --> 10:15.640
I get automatic detention.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.560
I would have
gotten it this time,

10:17.560 --> 10:18.280
but I think she felt
sorry for me.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.120
People have died
from things less embarrassing

10:20.120 --> 10:23.280
than almost having
a private note read in class.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.600
What did it say?

10:24.600 --> 10:25.680
I don't remember.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.240
That's how embarrassing it was.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.680
Aw, man, that's cool.
Yeah.

10:30.680 --> 10:31.400
Wait a minute.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.160
How can he hang out with the guy
who got you in trouble?

10:34.160 --> 10:35.240
Oh, haven't you heard?

10:35.240 --> 10:37.720
Raymond and Louis
are very close now.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.720
Yeah, yeah.

10:38.720 --> 10:39.640
[Laughter]

10:39.640 --> 10:41.200
Oh, give me a break.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.000
Yeah, man.

10:42.000 --> 10:42.960
Thanks a lot, Louis.

10:42.960 --> 10:43.960
I almost got detention,
you know.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.960
But you didn't, right?
So stop complaining.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.440
Besides, you're the one
who's passing notes.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.560
Yeah, Alex, lighten up.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.560
Louis was just being funny.
Yeah.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.920
Um, I don't think so.

10:52.920 --> 10:53.640
Matter of fact--

10:53.640 --> 10:54.400
Hey, Alex, what's up

10:54.400 --> 10:55.400
with all these hats
all the time?

10:55.400 --> 10:58.000
Are you covering up something
under there or what?

10:58.000 --> 10:58.800
[Laughter]

10:58.800 --> 11:01.560
I can't be late
for my first day of history.

11:01.560 --> 11:01.920
Come on.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.000
Ray, you and I
really have to talk.

11:04.000 --> 11:04.680
You can talk later.

11:04.680 --> 11:08.480
Raymond's got to show me
how to get to class.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.720
Come on.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.760
Both:
Come on.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.160
Driscoll's
got the most amazing

11:20.160 --> 11:20.960
home entertainment system.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.320
I've never seen
anything like it.

11:22.320 --> 11:25.120
I didn't know the Plant
paid its salesmen that well.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.120
Caroline said
that they offered him

11:27.120 --> 11:28.880
a big raise to move,

11:28.880 --> 11:31.480
but they just hated
leaving Cincinnati.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.040
Alex, have you met Louis?

11:33.040 --> 11:34.320
Unfortunately.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.760
I bet he's a funny kid.

11:35.760 --> 11:36.920
Driscoll's a riot.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.200
What time is it?

11:38.200 --> 11:40.720
I guess Raymond forgot
to set his alarm.

11:40.720 --> 11:43.640
Could somebody please
take out the garbage?

11:46.320 --> 11:47.720
Thanks.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.400
[Dog barking]

11:54.320 --> 11:57.760
I don't think Alex is gonna
want to walk with us today.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.600
Is she still mad at you?

12:00.600 --> 12:02.760
Man, she's pretty touchy,
isn't she?

12:02.760 --> 12:05.120
I mean, what's there
to be so upset about?

12:05.120 --> 12:06.840
Yeah, you can understand.

12:06.840 --> 12:07.400
No, no, man.

12:07.400 --> 12:11.160
I mean, she's just mad
that we're friends,

12:11.160 --> 12:13.040
but that's her problem, man.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.160
Forget about her.

12:14.160 --> 12:17.640
I mean, doesn't she have
any other friends?

12:22.440 --> 12:24.160
Yeah, she's got other friends.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.800
No, no, no,
it's not that simple.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.440
Yeah, she's got other friends.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.440
See, we always walk together.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.240
It's like a historical thing,
you know?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.400
Alex, did Ray show up?

12:40.400 --> 12:41.160
I don't think Ray and I

12:41.160 --> 12:44.080
are gonna be walking to school
together anymore.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.320
What was that all about?

12:56.320 --> 12:58.520
Don't know.
Are Alex and Ray fighting?

12:58.520 --> 13:00.080
Something like that.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.080
[Sighs]

13:10.240 --> 13:12.400
Excuse me, honey.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.120
What?

13:13.120 --> 13:14.600
Pardon me, honey.

13:24.800 --> 13:28.440
I guess Ray dumped Alex
for that Driscoll kid.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.400
Well, that's terrible.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.720
I'm sure he's not that funny.

13:31.720 --> 13:32.240
Poor Alex.

13:32.240 --> 13:35.120
She and Raymond have been
best friends forever.

13:35.120 --> 13:35.640
Poor Alex?

13:35.640 --> 13:38.200
What do you think
it's been like for Raymond?

13:38.200 --> 13:40.400
Don't joke, Annie.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.520
I would think ultimate
is more about coordination.

13:43.520 --> 13:44.560
Well, yeah,
I guess it helps

13:44.560 --> 13:46.040
To be pretty good
with a frisbee.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.640
Right, you can't
be a total spaz.

13:48.640 --> 13:49.960
Hey, Alex.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.000
[Distorted]
Whoa.

14:30.000 --> 14:30.960
Whoa.

14:30.960 --> 14:31.760
Whoa!

14:38.600 --> 14:41.760
Peaceful View
has some pretty strong players.

14:53.040 --> 14:53.880
Whoa!

14:56.920 --> 14:58.040
Okay, okay, let me tell you.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.960
So this hall monitor
says to me--

14:59.960 --> 15:00.840
He goes, "Hey, there,

15:00.840 --> 15:03.040
knock it off
with all the tardiness,"

15:03.040 --> 15:04.280
and I say--

15:04.280 --> 15:06.360
Whoa.

15:06.360 --> 15:09.640
How did Alex get all the way
down there so fast?

15:09.640 --> 15:12.400
Did she take a shortcut
or something?

15:12.400 --> 15:15.040
Or something.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.080
[Chuckles]

15:23.800 --> 15:27.280
[Indistinct conversation]

15:27.920 --> 15:29.640
Okay, um,
I've got a brownie here

15:29.640 --> 15:33.480
I'd be willing to trade
for a raspberry lemon square.

15:34.720 --> 15:35.960
Alex?

15:37.320 --> 15:38.600
We got to talk.

15:38.600 --> 15:42.280
Is it just me, or does
everyone here hate cheerleaders?

15:43.720 --> 15:46.440
All right, Mrs. Ward
this morning:

15:46.440 --> 15:47.280
"What should I wear today?

15:47.280 --> 15:50.960
The living room curtains
or the sofa slipcover?"

15:50.960 --> 15:52.040
[Laughter]

15:52.040 --> 15:54.920
Louis thinks he's so funny.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.720
So Ray, you're finished
with Alex, right?

16:02.720 --> 16:05.160
Yeah, I don't see the point
of hanging out with her

16:05.160 --> 16:06.600
When I got you as my friend.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.000
All right.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.800
Hey, where'd everybody go?

16:10.800 --> 16:14.040
[Wind howls]

16:15.480 --> 16:18.840
[Metallic jangling]

16:23.760 --> 16:26.880
[Warbling western music]

16:28.200 --> 16:29.800
Hey, Driscoll.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.360
What do you want?

16:31.360 --> 16:33.280
You've been hanging out
with Ray a lot.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.600
Don't you got any other friends?

16:34.600 --> 16:36.960
What's the problem, Alex?

16:36.960 --> 16:38.200
Jealous?

16:40.960 --> 16:42.040
Careful, man.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.360
She's fast.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.600
Stand back, Ray.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.520
This is between Alex

16:46.520 --> 16:47.760
and me.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.800
[buzzer clicks]

17:15.560 --> 17:17.000
[energy crackles]

17:27.880 --> 17:29.560
<i>Now that's funny.</i>

17:29.560 --> 17:30.880
[Chuckles]

17:39.160 --> 17:40.480
How about that Toby?

17:40.480 --> 17:41.400
Oh, yeah.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.520
One minute, he's
"yes, mother" and "no, mother."

17:43.520 --> 17:45.800
And the next, he's bullying
some kindergarteners.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.200
Yeah.
This guy's got problems.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.120
Yeah, man.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.240
Hey, but who can blame him?

17:50.240 --> 17:53.480
I wouldn't want anyone to know
if I was Mrs. Ward's son.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.920
[Laughter]

17:54.920 --> 17:56.040
Uh, Ray?

17:56.040 --> 17:57.760
What does Toby look like?

17:57.760 --> 18:01.080
He's big, mean, and funny...

18:01.800 --> 18:03.000
Looking.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.600
[Gasps]

18:05.600 --> 18:06.600
Hey, Toby!

18:06.600 --> 18:07.120
My main man.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.080
I knew you were
a jerk, Alvarado,

18:09.080 --> 18:10.720
and you just proved it.

18:10.720 --> 18:11.520
I'm not really.

18:11.520 --> 18:14.040
A little goofy, maybe,
but not a jerk.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.000
That seems kind of strong.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.880
I hate violence.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.000
Leave him alone!

18:21.000 --> 18:21.760
Careful.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.000
He'll take it as an invitation.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.360
Toby, I apologize.

18:27.360 --> 18:28.880
I promise I'll never
say anything

18:28.880 --> 18:30.720
about you and your mom again.

18:30.720 --> 18:31.720
Hold on, Toby.

18:31.720 --> 18:32.400
Who are you?

18:32.400 --> 18:33.800
My name's Louis Driscoll,

18:33.800 --> 18:35.240
and why don't you lighten up?

18:35.240 --> 18:36.160
[Scoffs]

18:36.160 --> 18:36.840
Really, Toby.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.680
A guy's word is his bond.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.400
If Raymond here says he's sorry,

18:40.400 --> 18:41.800
he's sorry, okay?

18:41.800 --> 18:44.840
You're gonna take the heat
for your friend?

18:44.840 --> 18:46.920
I guess so.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.120
It's okay, Louis.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.760
I can fight my own battles.

18:49.760 --> 18:50.800
Forget it, Alvarado.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.560
If your friend wants a fight,

18:52.560 --> 18:54.200
let him fight.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.000
[Gasps and laughter]

19:04.000 --> 19:05.520
Ahh!
Yeah!

19:05.520 --> 19:08.920
[Cheers and applause]

19:16.720 --> 19:20.160
[Cheers and applause]

19:24.920 --> 19:26.280
Quit moving!

19:34.440 --> 19:37.000
[Birds chirping]

19:37.000 --> 19:40.800
[Groaning
and indistinct conversation]

19:43.000 --> 19:44.200
[Groans]

19:46.120 --> 19:47.520
We even now?

19:47.520 --> 19:48.960
[Scoffs]

19:53.200 --> 19:54.840
I hope this shows you, Toby,

19:54.840 --> 19:58.080
violence is never the answer.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.880
Hey, you're leaving
awfully early today.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.400
I know.
I've got some stuff to do.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.480
Okay, well, I hope
you have a good day.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.680
I'm gonna try.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.600
Hey, wait a sec.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.280
Did you patch things up

20:25.280 --> 20:27.600
between you and Raymond
and Lewis?

20:27.600 --> 20:28.480
Nope.
Oh.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.560
But don't worry about it, Mom.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.360
Okay.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.800
Bye.
Bye.

20:45.920 --> 20:46.760
Alex?

20:46.760 --> 20:47.280
Hi, Louis.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.200
I'm here to pick you up
for school.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.920
You are?

20:51.920 --> 20:53.480
Is this a joke?

20:53.480 --> 20:54.680
No, no joke.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.760
I thought you hated me.

20:56.760 --> 20:57.440
I thought I did too,

20:57.440 --> 20:59.240
but then you stood up
for Raymond,

20:59.240 --> 21:01.360
and I figured
you couldn't be all bad.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.960
<i> No, I'm not all bad.</i>

21:06.360 --> 21:07.040
To tell you the truth,

21:07.040 --> 21:08.800
pretty much everyone
in Cincinnati

21:08.800 --> 21:10.160
was glad to see me go.

21:10.160 --> 21:10.920
It's my personality.

21:10.920 --> 21:14.680
Sometimes it, like,
malfunctions or something.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.640
So work on it.

21:16.640 --> 21:17.880
I'll try.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.640
I'll really try.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.080
Well, now
I'm completely confused.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.400
So am I.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.960
Oh, is that unusual
for you guys?

21:31.360 --> 21:32.520
[Chuckles]

21:32.520 --> 21:35.800
So I apologized to Alex
for the note thing.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.080
What'd she say?

21:37.080 --> 21:38.400
That if I did anything
like that again,

21:38.400 --> 21:40.640
she'd tell Toby
I had a crush on his mother.

21:40.640 --> 21:41.120
[Laughs]

21:41.120 --> 21:44.840
Hey, Raymond, are we gonna
play ultimate or what?

21:45.440 --> 21:46.200
Depends.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.280
Let's see your toss.

21:47.280 --> 21:48.880
Show him, Alex.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.980
[Drumroll]

22:02.960 --> 22:04.040
Wow!

22:04.040 --> 22:06.080
She's incredible.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.360
I know.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.520
