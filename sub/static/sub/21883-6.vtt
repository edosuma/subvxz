00:24.524 --> 00:26.985
"IN 15 MINUTES I'LL RESOLVE
THE PROBLEM WITH THE REBELS":

00:27.068 --> 00:28.319
ANOTHER BROKEN PROMISE

00:32.115 --> 00:33.158
PRESIDENTIAL DECEPTION:

00:33.241 --> 00:38.538
THE PRESIDENT OF CHANGE,
FROM 70% TO 30% NATIONAL APPROVAL

00:40.457 --> 00:41.583
END OF PRESIDENTIAL TERM:

00:41.666 --> 00:47.922
THE PRESIDENT LEAVES BEHIND INSECURITY
AND DRUG TRAFFICKING WITH NO SOLUTION

00:50.216 --> 00:51.634
OTHERS

00:53.219 --> 00:56.681
ANDRÉS LABRADOR LEADS AS PREFERRED
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENTIAL VOTE

01:26.878 --> 01:29.923
Congratulations, the poll results
are very encouraging.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.594
Everything indicates your boss
will be the next president.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.474
He won't be seeing you.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.938
He wants you to know he values
your interest in working for him,

01:46.940 --> 01:50.151
but he doesn't want anybody who is
related to past governments.

01:53.988 --> 01:56.282
That's exactly what the
current president said.

01:57.408 --> 02:00.453
But eventually, everybody needs someone
to do the dirty work.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.664
Perhaps...

02:04.707 --> 02:07.627
but we don't want deals made
with drug lords during his term,

02:07.961 --> 02:09.712
and that's what you're good at.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.179
That he named you his coordinator...

02:19.347 --> 02:22.100
only means he lets others
do the dirty work for him.

02:24.185 --> 02:27.981
Tell him he can save that
fake morality for the media,

02:29.774 --> 02:33.194
and to reconsider the information
I send him.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.173
-Sir, it has begun.
-Fuck...

03:04.434 --> 03:05.476
What did I miss?

03:05.685 --> 03:08.104
Not much. It just started.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.774
<i>The biggest problem</i>
<i>facing our country...</i>

03:11.858 --> 03:14.485
<i>is the disproportionate power</i>

03:15.570 --> 03:19.449
<i>that the two main parties have exercised</i>
<i>while ruling Mexico.</i>

03:21.159 --> 03:22.327
<i>Both the IWP</i>

03:22.410 --> 03:23.953
ANDRÉS LABRADOR
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR THE PRP

03:24.037 --> 03:26.956
<i>and the DAP,</i>

03:27.540 --> 03:33.504
<i>the ones you trusted with your vote</i>
<i>in the last elections,</i>

03:34.172 --> 03:37.717
<i>are the two sides of the same coin.</i>

03:39.177 --> 03:43.264
<i>During my government,</i>
<i>criminals will be imprisoned,</i>

03:44.307 --> 03:49.103
<i>no matter which party they belong to</i>
<i>or how much money they have.</i>

03:50.480 --> 03:56.736
<i>The impunity deals struck for them</i>
<i>and their partners... is over now.</i>

03:57.362 --> 03:58.488
<i>Game over.</i>

04:05.995 --> 04:06.829
Hello?

04:06.913 --> 04:10.124
<i>I sense Andrés Labrador won't</i>
<i>cooperate with us, Conrado.</i>

04:10.750 --> 04:13.086
<i>I like the bastard,</i>
<i>but he makes me nervous.</i>

04:13.169 --> 04:14.462
He's only good at speaking.

04:15.171 --> 04:17.924
I need the next president
to hold us in high esteem,

04:18.883 --> 04:20.635
so he will respect our deals.

04:21.678 --> 04:25.181
Do whatever you need to, but stay
in the government, are we clear?

04:25.515 --> 04:28.059
<i>Focus on your issue with the Cano</i>
<i>and leave the rest to me.</i>

04:28.893 --> 04:30.520
Don't worry about Labrador...

04:31.562 --> 04:32.897
he won't win.

04:45.785 --> 04:49.747
<i>I feel the warmth </i>
<i>from my boiling blood</i>

04:50.081 --> 04:54.294
<i>I feel the fear, sweat dripping away</i>

04:54.544 --> 04:58.589
<i>There's a stillness</i>
<i>that nothing transmits</i>

04:59.048 --> 05:05.221
<i>I am a breeze that grows stronger</i>

05:05.680 --> 05:08.808
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

05:09.934 --> 05:13.438
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

05:14.063 --> 05:17.775
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

05:18.776 --> 05:22.905
<i>To unleash my return</i>

05:27.201 --> 05:31.122
<i>I have the dust that protects the road</i>

05:31.581 --> 05:35.752
<i>I have the branches of a leafless tree</i>

05:36.210 --> 05:40.173
<i>I'm the guardian of the tired night</i>

05:40.631 --> 05:46.679
<i>There are silhouettes</i>
<i>that come to meet me</i>

05:47.055 --> 05:51.350
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

05:51.476 --> 05:54.520
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

05:55.563 --> 05:59.150
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

06:00.276 --> 06:04.155
<i>To unleash my return</i>

06:07.909 --> 06:11.871
<i>..the victory of the DAP for</i>
<i>the presidency of the republic.</i>

06:17.543 --> 06:20.797
President Felipe!
President Felipe!

06:38.523 --> 06:40.441
FELIPE ALARCÓN
DAP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

06:40.942 --> 06:42.026
How are you doing?

06:42.360 --> 06:44.278
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

06:45.321 --> 06:48.032
-Sorry for the inconvenience.
-None at all.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.202
I am glad to find a spot
in the next president's schedule.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.956
Thank you for saying I'm
the next president.

06:55.581 --> 06:56.833
We are still fighting for it.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.001
But Labrador knows how to sell his image.

06:59.418 --> 07:02.588
He presents himself as the
savior of this country.

07:06.884 --> 07:10.263
I can help you uncover something
no one knows about him yet.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.101
We all have our secrets.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.898
I know how to discover them.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.693
What do you want in exchange?

07:27.363 --> 07:31.117
That you name me Secretary for Public
Security when you are elected.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.415
Do we have a deal?

07:43.129 --> 07:46.883
Show me you can help me,
and you'll have what you want.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.497
CHAPO'S SAFE HOUSE

08:24.795 --> 08:26.839
We made Michoacan's men retreat,

08:27.798 --> 08:29.050
but I almost didn't make it.

08:30.176 --> 08:33.262
Cano is attacking the turf, sir,
killing everybody,

08:33.679 --> 08:35.890
saying it's because Nazario
entered the Federation.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.310
Tell Arturo and La Muñeca to go there
with more men.

08:39.644 --> 08:43.189
And have Placencia and Chente
send people to Veracruz and Tabasco.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.273
I don't want any survivors.

08:45.858 --> 08:46.859
There is a more urgent matter.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.029
The Emes got in Canelas.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.656
Fucking morons.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.866
He could have broken into my house.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.161
We need more people like you.
Can you find any?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.121
Give me a chance,
and I'll get a team for you.

08:59.413 --> 09:00.748
Call the Canelas as well.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.752
Whoever wants to help. Prepare the trip.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.340
I'll deal with the Emes myself.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.013
FEDERAL POLICE BUILDING
MEXICO CITY

09:38.536 --> 09:39.620
Food's here.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.289
Thank you, boss.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.250
Anything about Labrador?

09:45.501 --> 09:46.961
Did you investigate his brother's death?

09:50.006 --> 09:51.757
Yes. Nothing we can use.

09:51.841 --> 09:55.177
Labrador was 10 when it happened,
and it was an accident.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.264
What else did you find?

09:58.556 --> 09:59.640
Nothing useful.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.434
No way.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.853
No one gets that high
without getting their hands dirty.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.897
You only have to remove the soil to find
their darkest secrets.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.358
In that case,
he knows how to hide them.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.320
No infidelities, no secret accounts.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.905
And his family lives modestly.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.411
What about his collaborators?

10:23.914 --> 10:25.374
Who do we investigate first?

10:33.215 --> 10:35.176
Andrés, I have good news.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.763
We got money for the campaign.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.017
It's not the teachers' money, is it?

10:43.309 --> 10:45.061
I want nothing to do with the Union.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.562
No, they don't have money.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.856
They wanted to help in a different way.

10:49.815 --> 10:50.941
Not another word.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.694
The less I know, the better.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.823
Where does the support come from?

10:58.783 --> 11:00.201
From a businessman.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.537
Carlos Almada.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.915
I don't want any deals with him.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.460
If you want to gain popularity,
we need more resources.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.754
I'd have to pay dearly for the favor.

11:13.255 --> 11:17.593
Besides, it's well known we don't use
dirty money on my campaign.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.972
Not all the money we accepted was clean.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.435
It's money from people who want
to do the right thing now.

11:27.019 --> 11:30.189
We all get a second chance,
except Carlos Almada.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.566
He has no intention of doing such a thing.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.444
-I can ask him.
-No!

11:37.655 --> 11:39.615
I don't want you to contact him anymore.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.302
ROAD TO VICTORY!

12:03.931 --> 12:05.433
-So?
-Nothing.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.143
CÉSAR MAYNEZ
CAMPAIGN PRESS SECRETARY

12:16.152 --> 12:19.029
He refused the help from the Union

12:19.155 --> 12:20.239
and Carlos Almada's as well.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.824
What the fuck does he want me to do?

12:22.158 --> 12:23.325
You should know him by now.

12:23.826 --> 12:26.579
Sometimes he says no to everything,
and others he accepts.

12:26.662 --> 12:27.705
Whatever is convenient.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.040
Be patient.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.210
I'd rather have money.
Then I can be patient.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.171
I know.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.531
Yes, sir, right away.

13:04.658 --> 13:05.784
Go in, please.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.953
Mr. Almada can see you now.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.715
CARLOS ALMADA
BUSINESSMAN

13:24.512 --> 13:25.721
Nice to see you, Carlos.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.351
It's 45,000.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.061
Thank you.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.339
<i>Do they fit? I can ask Julia for a box.</i>

14:00.422 --> 14:01.549
<i>No, they fit.</i>

14:30.369 --> 14:33.205
<i>With this help, you can rest assured</i>
<i>it'll go very well for you.</i>

14:34.039 --> 14:35.958
<i>We don't forget our friends.</i>

14:43.007 --> 14:44.091
<i>Thank you.</i>

15:06.030 --> 15:09.533
Let me go with you, sir. You'll need me
when you go against the Emes.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.912
Stay put.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.580
I need you fully recovered.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.498
You're no good to us like that.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.459
Dad.

15:19.585 --> 15:20.753
Where are you going?

15:24.048 --> 15:26.425
Don't worry, son. I'll be fine.

15:27.551 --> 15:28.802
You don't know that.

15:29.511 --> 15:30.679
How's your grandma?

15:31.639 --> 15:32.473
Not so good.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.058
Are you still visiting her every day?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.977
How can you be so coldblooded?

15:39.021 --> 15:41.231
The Chente killed my uncle,
and you still make deals with him.

15:41.523 --> 15:42.566
That's why you came here?

15:43.525 --> 15:44.652
To criticize my decisions?

15:44.735 --> 15:45.819
He was your brother, Dad.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.906
Excuse me, sir. We are ready.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.119
Is this what Quino thinks, too?

15:57.915 --> 16:00.709
No one knows your feelings
better than yourself.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.505
That I hold back doesn't mean
it doesn't hurt me,

16:05.673 --> 16:07.508
but what I am doing now is bigger

16:07.591 --> 16:09.009
than your uncle's death,
may he rest in peace.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.179
-But how can you...
-OK, boy, enough!

16:14.306 --> 16:16.934
If you don't walk in my shoes,
you know nothing about my path.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.686
And don't make that face.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.855
I don't want to leave angry with you.

16:21.939 --> 16:22.856
Come here.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.281
LABRADOR'S CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS
MEXICO CITY

16:31.865 --> 16:33.826
Andrés, nice to meet you.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.998
No, sorry, not that.

16:40.082 --> 16:40.958
Sorry.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.377
Andrés, the interview starts
in five minutes.

16:44.211 --> 16:47.131
If the reporter crosses the line,
don't answer.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.716
We got your back.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.260
No, don't help him either, got it?

16:51.593 --> 16:53.178
Poncho the Clown wants an interview.

16:53.679 --> 16:54.555
No fucking way.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.265
And I said yes.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.392
You are a bastard.

16:59.143 --> 17:02.187
Don't be a diva.
His show has high ratings.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.440
Look, don't do it for yourself,

17:04.815 --> 17:06.442
do it for the campaign, OK?

17:34.011 --> 17:36.972
<i>We are all very interested</i>
<i>in this presidential race.</i>

17:37.806 --> 17:40.225
It even looks like we have
a winner already.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.478
But like we say in soccer:

17:43.145 --> 17:45.731
it ain't over until it's over.

17:45.981 --> 17:46.815
That's right.

17:47.399 --> 17:50.152
The best goals can happen
in the last minute.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.237
So, before asking anything,

17:52.738 --> 17:55.949
my production team prepared
a video about the campaign.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.534
-Shall we play it?
-Of course.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.708
<i>Are you sure they fit?</i>
<i>Or do you want me to ask Julia for...</i>

18:04.792 --> 18:06.835
-Hey!
<i>-No, they fit.</i>

18:06.919 --> 18:09.630
But that's you, professor.
What were you doing?

18:10.798 --> 18:13.884
You've been caught red-handed.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.302
That's you, isn't it?

18:16.970 --> 18:21.058
Yes, that's me.
And the other man is Carlos Almada.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.559
That's money to support the campaign.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.937
It's pretty common during elections.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.188
I am not stupid!

18:26.605 --> 18:28.107
<i>Don't come and tell me</i>
<i>this is normal!</i>

18:28.565 --> 18:31.610
<i>We are sick of your frauds!</i>

18:34.029 --> 18:36.865
I want to clarify

18:38.117 --> 18:42.079
<i>that the professor acted alone.</i>

18:43.831 --> 18:45.207
<i>What's happening here</i>

18:45.916 --> 18:47.584
<i>is not a coincidence.</i>

18:48.502 --> 18:51.213
<i>They've been trying to make us fall.</i>

18:53.507 --> 18:56.093
<i>They want to ruin</i>
<i>my campaign's reputation.</i>

18:59.096 --> 19:00.681
How did all this bullshit affect us?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.016
We are still on top,
but we went down seven points.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.560
PRESIDENTIAL POLLS
2006

19:09.815 --> 19:11.525
Fucking professor.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.068
He wants to talk to you,

19:13.152 --> 19:14.653
-he won't stop calling.
-No, no.

19:15.654 --> 19:19.158
He has to assume his responsibility.
I don't want to see him again.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.620
They want to fuck us, César.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.543
They want to fuck us, César.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.006
Ask our contacts to find out

19:35.215 --> 19:38.802
who is responsible for all this.

19:40.637 --> 19:41.471
OK.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.383
Well done.

20:19.593 --> 20:22.512
You did your part,
now I'll do mine.

20:38.737 --> 20:39.780
Cuba?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.366
You need to escape.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.786
While we solve all this embezzlement.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.163
Until we get into calmer waters.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.166
Is it safe?

20:52.668 --> 20:55.087
You are not the first one who
needs to run away, Carlos.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.840
We've never had problems
with their hospitality.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.610
Go upstairs!

21:42.092 --> 21:43.552
Those were the last ones, sir.

21:45.053 --> 21:46.346
Call the others.

21:49.933 --> 21:51.810
<i>Thank you for coming to back us up.</i>

21:54.313 --> 21:56.690
And special thanks for your courage

21:56.773 --> 21:58.191
to take the Emes out of their home.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.320
The war continues,

22:02.446 --> 22:04.573
but those fuckers won't return to Canelas!

22:07.034 --> 22:09.536
Let's drink. It's well deserved!

22:09.786 --> 22:11.580
Let's go!

22:20.255 --> 22:21.506
We're staying here for a while,

22:22.049 --> 22:24.092
just in case Cano decides to return.

22:24.760 --> 22:29.598
Toño, organize a huge party
for the whole town.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.725
The happier they are,

22:32.684 --> 22:35.145
the more they will cooperate.

22:35.771 --> 22:36.813
Go.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.416
Girls.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.629
What's up? Did you get the dress?

23:01.713 --> 23:02.798
Look at this.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.135
It's a bit short.

23:08.011 --> 23:09.679
OK, I'm leaving, mom's waiting.

23:20.857 --> 23:22.359
You look like a doll, honey.

23:26.404 --> 23:27.322
Elbita,

23:28.281 --> 23:29.950
I can trust you, can't I?

23:33.370 --> 23:35.914
You know men want only one thing.

23:36.790 --> 23:37.791
Come on, Mom.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.212
Listen to your mother.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.590
No one buys a fruit someone else bit.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.763
-Did you buy the vegetables?
-Of course.

23:54.182 --> 23:56.059
All right, take it off.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.853
You might get it dirty before the party.

24:17.038 --> 24:17.956
Want to dance?

24:41.396 --> 24:43.648
Where's the music? Come on!

25:15.764 --> 25:16.640
Want to dance?

25:27.234 --> 25:28.151
How old are you?

25:31.029 --> 25:32.030
<i>Guess.</i>

25:34.282 --> 25:35.408
<i>Fifteen, at most.</i>

25:37.327 --> 25:38.411
Fifteen.

25:39.704 --> 25:40.705
Is that a joke?

25:41.331 --> 25:42.582
You look like you're at least 20.

25:44.709 --> 25:45.710
<i>I am 17.</i>

25:50.131 --> 25:52.259
<i>What, are you scared of me?</i>

25:52.842 --> 25:53.677
No.

25:55.262 --> 25:57.305
<i>But you'll have to wait until I turn 18.</i>

25:57.847 --> 25:58.890
<i>All right.</i>

26:00.517 --> 26:01.977
I'll be counting the days.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.692
Yes, I got it.

26:09.943 --> 26:11.486
I am looking at them right now.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.535
Count on it.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.747
I am glad to help deliver the final blow.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.547
FACING THE CRISIS
"THE ALTERNATIVE SOCIAL ANTI-CAPITALIST"

26:38.972 --> 26:41.099
They are ready. I hope you like them.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.022
Excellent.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.570
Add this phrase.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.712
<i>Andrés Labrador will</i>
<i>implement a government</i>

27:10.795 --> 27:13.173
<i>like his friend the dictator, Hugo Chávez.</i>

27:13.256 --> 27:15.925
<i>Our currency will lose value,</i>
<i>and our companies will be confiscated.</i>

27:16.009 --> 27:20.013
<i>Andrés Labrador: a danger to Mexico.</i>

27:26.519 --> 27:28.188
How long has this been circulating?

27:28.938 --> 27:30.482
Since this morning.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.533
We have to expose him, César.

27:42.285 --> 27:44.829
We have to prove they are creating
a campaign against me.

27:51.795 --> 27:52.879
And Almada?

27:53.671 --> 27:55.215
Where the fuck is Almada?

27:55.382 --> 27:57.342
We are on that.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.637
The new polls are out.

28:02.430 --> 28:03.890
Felipe Alarcón has tied us.

28:05.683 --> 28:07.310
PRESIDENTIAL POLLS
2006

28:09.062 --> 28:11.106
Turn the TV on. They found Almada in Cuba.

28:14.984 --> 28:17.779
<i>That's why I think</i>
<i>those in power don't want</i>

28:17.862 --> 28:20.115
<i>Andrés Labrador to become president.</i>

28:20.657 --> 28:22.534
<i>That's why they released</i>
<i>the recordings,</i>

28:23.159 --> 28:24.452
<i>to damage his reputation.</i>

28:24.828 --> 28:26.663
<i>All this was organized</i>
<i>at the highest level.</i>

28:26.913 --> 28:28.832
<i>That's exactly why I am here,</i>

28:28.957 --> 28:30.333
<i>paying for something I didn't do.</i>

28:31.042 --> 28:32.001
<i>But...</i>

28:32.127 --> 28:34.003
-...but <i>when they...</i>
-Call a press conference.

28:34.671 --> 28:37.132
We are taking advantage of all this.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.134
<i>-When they...</i>
-As much as we can.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.302
<i>...didn't want to give me bodyguards,</i>
<i>that's when I knew that...</i>

28:41.386 --> 28:43.513
<i>The video of Carlos Almada</i>

28:44.723 --> 28:46.808
is definitive evidence

28:48.143 --> 28:50.854
that there's a conspiracy,

28:50.937 --> 28:53.898
a plot against me.

28:56.443 --> 29:00.447
The powerful mafias are shaking

29:00.947 --> 29:02.615
because their game is over.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.202
In my government,

29:07.662 --> 29:11.916
these white collar criminals
will be punished

29:12.083 --> 29:14.461
for their deeds against...

29:31.394 --> 29:33.480
You did Labrador a favor.

29:34.147 --> 29:37.692
His popularity is higher than ever,
all the country talks of a plot,

29:37.859 --> 29:40.695
and if that's not enough, now
they are talking about my government,

29:40.779 --> 29:42.655
and I didn't even have anything
to do with it.

29:42.822 --> 29:44.949
Cuba was always a safe place
to send unwanted people.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.368
I didn't know Fidel Castro
would give Almada up

29:47.494 --> 29:51.122
because he still resents you
for what happened in Monterrey.

29:51.331 --> 29:53.291
To be honest, kicking Fidel Castro

29:53.374 --> 29:55.210
out of an International Summit
was a big mistake.

29:55.293 --> 29:58.254
Be elected first,
and then you may give your opinion!

29:59.088 --> 30:01.466
And you, Sol, fix this problem

30:01.549 --> 30:04.344
or I swear you'll never hold another
public position again!

30:13.978 --> 30:15.021
What do you have?

30:15.939 --> 30:19.150
The Teachers Union made a very
unorthodox proposition to Labrador,

30:19.776 --> 30:20.610
but he rejected it.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.403
Were they offering money or votes?

30:23.154 --> 30:24.113
Votes.

30:25.406 --> 30:27.700
Meddle in booths all over the country.

30:31.204 --> 30:34.082
What he rejected can be of use to us.

30:36.042 --> 30:38.795
Send me the contact information
of the person who made the offer.

30:42.090 --> 30:45.802
Felipe, I have useful information that
can help you win the elections,

30:46.553 --> 30:48.471
but we'll need a lot of money.

30:48.555 --> 30:51.099
ANDRÉS LABRADOR GAINS IN POLLS
THANKS TO PLOT SCANDAL

30:51.182 --> 30:54.519
Sir, it's Mr. Sol.

30:57.897 --> 30:59.774
You read my mind, Conrado.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.944
What's all this Labrador bullshit?

31:08.116 --> 31:09.200
I'm in.

31:10.201 --> 31:11.703
How much money do you need?

31:30.930 --> 31:31.764
Nice to meet you.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.310
Our candidate asked me to
make the negotiations

31:35.393 --> 31:36.644
with the Teachers Union.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.317
She is our contact in the union.

31:44.652 --> 31:45.737
Nothing for me, thanks.

31:49.073 --> 31:51.075
Here's the information for
getting in touch with her.

31:51.951 --> 31:55.580
The Union has more than two million
members at your disposal.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.082
As I mentioned to the candidate,

31:59.375 --> 32:00.293
it will be expensive,

32:01.586 --> 32:02.879
but it's worth negotiating.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.339
We're on it.

32:04.547 --> 32:07.050
We need your support more than ever

32:07.175 --> 32:09.218
so our country doesn't fall
into the claws of an opportunist

32:09.302 --> 32:12.889
who seeks to polarize the population
and throw the economy off balance.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.516
We want to protect your companies

32:15.683 --> 32:17.852
and continue the nation's progress.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.563
<i>The businessmen feel uneasy</i>
<i>about the possibility</i>

32:20.688 --> 32:21.856
<i>of a victory by Labrador.</i>

32:22.523 --> 32:23.733
So do we.

32:23.858 --> 32:25.944
We'll set Mexico free

32:26.027 --> 32:28.529
from the imminent danger that
Labrador represents.

33:10.738 --> 33:12.573
This better turn out well, Conrado.

33:14.450 --> 33:16.536
You don't want
problems with Joaquín.

33:17.954 --> 33:19.288
Are those your words or his?

33:20.873 --> 33:24.919
His. And I advise you not to fuck it up.

33:36.472 --> 33:40.101
JULY 2, 2006

33:46.733 --> 33:50.194
<i>Voting began</i>
<i>very early this morning.</i>

33:50.278 --> 33:52.447
<i>Today Mexicans will choose</i>
<i>our new president.</i>

33:54.449 --> 33:57.744
In this election, the Mexican citizens
living abroad had to...

33:57.869 --> 34:00.788
Today, Sunday July 2nd, is not only about

34:00.872 --> 34:02.874
<i>choosing a new president,</i>

34:02.957 --> 34:05.084
<i>federal deputies and senators...</i>

34:05.168 --> 34:06.044
<i>As you might remember,</i>

34:06.127 --> 34:07.879
<i>the last public polls...</i>

34:07.962 --> 34:11.591
<i>...showed the winner was</i>
<i>Andrés Labrador, from the left party.</i>

34:12.175 --> 34:14.260
<i>Felipe Alarcón</i>
<i>was following him closely...</i>

34:14.343 --> 34:16.179
<i>...but several points behind.</i>

34:21.559 --> 34:24.562
Labrador, Labrador, Labrador!

34:24.645 --> 34:27.607
Let's calm down.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.400
-Let's calm down.
-Labrador!

34:29.567 --> 34:32.278
Labrador, Labrador!

34:32.987 --> 34:35.406
<i>The first counts of the day</i>

34:35.531 --> 34:39.702
<i>show that the left candidate,</i>
<i>Andrés Labrador, has a small advantage.</i>

34:39.786 --> 34:44.957
<i>The presidential council has given the</i>
<i>results without declaring a winner.</i>

34:45.041 --> 34:47.710
<i>Felipe Alarcón is following him</i>
<i>three points behind...</i>

34:48.002 --> 34:50.755
I hope Conrado invested the money
we gave him wisely.

34:51.464 --> 34:54.300
If this motherfucker gets elected,
the party's over for us.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.645
Is the Union adding votes already?

35:08.106 --> 35:09.690
Are they in charge of the booths?

35:12.151 --> 35:16.823
<i>...the law professor explained</i>
<i>that electoral packets</i>

35:16.906 --> 35:20.076
<i>can be opened where</i>
<i>irregularities are reported.</i>

35:22.578 --> 35:24.914
<i>Many ballots from all over the country</i>

35:25.039 --> 35:27.125
<i>are being counted right now.</i>

35:28.167 --> 35:30.586
<i>Many intellectuals have denounced this</i>

35:30.670 --> 35:32.505
<i>as a possible electoral fraud.</i>

35:34.215 --> 35:37.385
<i>Labrador's advantage over Alarcón</i>
<i>grows smaller each time,</i>

35:37.468 --> 35:39.262
<i>and a re-count is being considered.</i>

35:41.347 --> 35:43.683
AT 8:00 P.M.
A TIE

35:46.352 --> 35:50.189
<i>Let's see the results now at this moment,</i>

35:50.273 --> 35:55.153
<i>at 11:00 p.m. with 31 minutes</i>
<i>and 35 seconds to go.</i>

35:55.236 --> 35:56.571
<i>Mexico is sleepless tonight.</i>

35:56.821 --> 36:01.576
<i>More supporters and collaborators</i>
<i>of the candidate are arriving here.</i>

36:01.742 --> 36:04.579
We lost Tamaulipas,
we lost Jalisco and Coahuila.

36:05.079 --> 36:08.332
Our people tell us that the Union
did a great job in the North.

36:10.126 --> 36:12.962
The Union will snatch
the election from us.

36:14.797 --> 36:16.215
There will be fraud, César.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.134
Sir.

36:22.221 --> 36:23.723
First winner.

36:28.102 --> 36:32.064
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready</i>
<i>to announce IFE's official report.</i>

36:32.607 --> 36:34.734
<i>We'll go directly to the facilities</i>

36:34.859 --> 36:36.652
<i>of the Electoral Federal Institute.</i>

36:37.486 --> 36:38.779
<i>Good evening.</i>

36:39.405 --> 36:42.617
<i>We Mexicans have engaged in</i>
<i>democracy once again.</i>

36:43.784 --> 36:48.372
<i>The preliminary result</i>
<i>of Mexico's president election</i>

36:48.456 --> 36:49.665
<i>is as follows:</i>

36:50.917 --> 36:53.669
<i>The candidate of the right party,</i>
<i>Felipe Alarcón</i>

36:54.503 --> 36:59.217
<i>has won the presidency</i>
<i>with only 0.56% lead</i>

36:59.300 --> 37:01.052
<i>over Andrés Labrador.</i>

37:27.411 --> 37:31.249
<i>Count each vote,</i>
<i>check each booth!</i>

37:31.332 --> 37:34.877
<i>Count each vote, check each booth!</i>

37:35.294 --> 37:37.421
<i>A lot of cash,</i>

37:38.506 --> 37:39.632
food stamps,

37:41.259 --> 37:42.969
building materials,

37:44.220 --> 37:46.973
home appliances,

37:48.307 --> 37:51.143
all that was part

37:51.686 --> 37:54.230
of a well planned,

37:55.064 --> 37:56.440
deliberate,

37:57.233 --> 37:59.360
and, of course, dishonest,

38:00.027 --> 38:01.696
anti-democratic,

38:03.030 --> 38:04.573
sale of votes.

38:06.284 --> 38:10.037
Felipe Alarcón has "won the elections"

38:10.538 --> 38:13.332
thanks to electoral fraud.

38:14.375 --> 38:20.965
<i>Felipe counted 100% of the 130,557 booths</i>

38:21.465 --> 38:24.468
<i>installed in the 300</i>
<i>different electoral sites of the country.</i>

38:24.552 --> 38:26.304
Congratulations, Mr. President.

38:36.022 --> 38:39.150
It will be my pleasure to have you as my
Secretary of Public Security.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.946
You won by a small margin.

38:44.947 --> 38:47.533
Let's see how you do in the government.

38:48.117 --> 38:51.120
You are right. Besides that small margin,

38:51.203 --> 38:54.957
the reports of electoral fraud
make your victory unconvincing.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.627
It won't be easy to rule
with such a rough start.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.006
We have to look for a way
to make your government more believable.

39:03.215 --> 39:06.469
I am ready to make hard choices, Conrado.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.388
I'll be known as the president

39:09.472 --> 39:11.432
who got drug trafficking under control
in this country,

39:12.183 --> 39:14.185
and you're the one who will help me do it.

39:17.980 --> 39:21.275
Fucking Conrado, you made me very nervous.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.152
Congratulations.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.405
Thanks a lot, Joaquín.

39:27.406 --> 39:28.866
This is just the beginning.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.829
Our new president is going to need you.
