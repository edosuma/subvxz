"Previously on" 24.

00:14.439 --> 00:19.048
Mr. President, with respect to the death
of Alan Milliken, I know you lied.

00:19.146 --> 00:21.768
You told the police Sherry was with you
at the time of Milliken's death.

00:21.864 --> 00:25.512
The fingerprints on this prescription bottle
prove otherwise.

00:25.608 --> 00:28.167
- What do you want?
- Your resignation.

00:28.263 --> 00:30.278
Without this, Sherry's got nothing, right?

00:30.407 --> 00:32.871
Now I can call Foxton,
and he can make this all disappear.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.885
You mean steal evidence?

00:34.983 --> 00:37.897
Jack, I just heard Tony tookJane Saunders
out of the building without authorization.

00:38.022 --> 00:40.264
Saunders has Michelle.
He wants to trade her for his daughter.

00:41.801 --> 00:43.942
Tony, put the gun on the dash!

00:44.040 --> 00:47.271
You help me make this trade, I'll turn myself
in, go to prison, whatever's gotta happen.

00:48.776 --> 00:51.081
We don't have a visual on Saunders.

00:51.175 --> 00:54.470
I repeat, we do not have a visual on Saunders.
Keep your teams down. Stay down.

00:55.942 --> 01:00.710
- I can't.
- Jane! It's okay. Come here.

01:00.839 --> 01:03.271
Teams 'A"and "B, "move. Move now!

01:03.397 --> 01:05.829
Move! Team one go!

01:07.494 --> 01:10.853
Stephen!

01:10.981 --> 01:14.790
I'm pinned down. Saunders has a helicopter.
Call in air support now!

01:14.919 --> 01:16.966
Let's go! Let's go!

01:23.206 --> 01:25.989
Eleven vials of the virus
are unaccounted for. Where are they?

01:26.087 --> 01:28.326
It's not gonna be that simple, Jack.

01:28.420 --> 01:32.549
This is Jack Bauer.
Saunders is in custody.

01:34.246 --> 01:38.021
The following takes place
between 11:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.

01:46.213 --> 01:48.164
Three men.

01:48.292 --> 01:51.685
" Move 'em up!"

02:02.852 --> 02:04.868
We just got verification
from Saunders's computer.

02:04.997 --> 02:06.820
There's 11 vials spread
across the country.

02:06.915 --> 02:09.282
- How long till you can give us
access on their location?
- I'm not sure I can.

02:09.381 --> 02:11.813
Saunders applied
a sophisticated decryption overlay.

02:11.942 --> 02:14.019
An unauthorized access
will auto-erase the file structure.

02:14.117 --> 02:15.747
- I'll keep trying.
- Okay.

02:17.859 --> 02:20.227
- Where are the 11 vials?
- You're wasting your time.

02:20.355 --> 02:22.406
I'm not foolish enough
to have that information in there.

02:22.531 --> 02:24.644
Where are the vials?

02:24.740 --> 02:28.003
In the hands of dedicated men.
True believers.

02:28.098 --> 02:31.396
- Believers in what?
- That the greatest threat to world peace...

02:31.522 --> 02:34.914
- comes from this country.
- There's a hotel not far from here...

02:35.043 --> 02:38.051
where 800 innocent people are
dead or dying because of you.

02:38.145 --> 02:40.291
Were they a threat to your world peace?

02:40.388 --> 02:43.011
The United States must be forced
to retreat within its own borders.

02:43.109 --> 02:45.858
Those people are simply
the first casualties of war.

02:48.964 --> 02:50.853
What happened to you, Stephen?

02:53.284 --> 02:56.130
I was abandoned by
the people I worked for.

02:57.985 --> 03:00.353
As you'll be someday.

03:00.449 --> 03:05.378
- But my message will be heard
in less than one hour.
- What are you talking about?

03:05.472 --> 03:07.715
My couriers have been instructed
to release the virus at noon.

03:07.809 --> 03:09.634
They're in fail-safe mode,
and they can't be recalled.

03:09.730 --> 03:11.619
Tell us where they are. We'll stop them.

03:13.572 --> 03:14.945
That is possible.

03:15.044 --> 03:17.794
But only if you agree to my terms.

03:17.889 --> 03:21.732
- What are your terms?
- I have a private jet waiting at Van Nuys Airport.

03:21.857 --> 03:26.626
I need to be on it with a presidential
guarantee of safe passage to North Africa.

03:26.754 --> 03:28.865
Never gonna happen.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.873
Then hundreds of thousands will die.

03:34.849 --> 03:37.312
I know what you're thinking, Jack.

03:37.441 --> 03:40.483
The Bosnian secret police worked on me
for two years and couldn't break me.

03:40.577 --> 03:44.095
You really think you'll be able to do it
in less than an hour?

03:44.194 --> 03:47.617
Get me on that plane, Jack.
You don't have a choice.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.521
Bring me Jane Saunders.

03:59.646 --> 04:01.919
I'm gonna need your gun, Tony.

04:08.287 --> 04:11.264
- Frisk him.
- Against the wall.

04:11.392 --> 04:15.520
- Hey. You don't have to do that.
- I've got my orders.

04:15.616 --> 04:17.278
- Take it easy on him. He's one of us.
- Not anymore.

04:17.375 --> 04:19.874
- What's going on?
- My orders are to take Almeida into custody.

04:19.998 --> 04:22.817
That's straight from
Brad Hammond at Division.

04:22.911 --> 04:26.462
I'm sorry, Tony.
There's nothing we can do right now.

04:26.558 --> 04:30.014
You just take care of business, Jack.
I'll be all right.

04:34.944 --> 04:38.720
- They said you wanted to see me.
- I need you to speak with your father.

04:40.512 --> 04:43.838
- "What do you want me to say?"
- "Try and make it personal."

04:43.967 --> 04:47.935
Try and connect with him. Tell him you're
scared. That you don't want him to do this.

04:49.599 --> 04:51.871
I'll try.

05:05.662 --> 05:11.229
I know what's going to happen,
and I know you can stop it. Please.

05:11.328 --> 05:14.172
I won't let them
use you to manipulate me.

05:16.605 --> 05:19.454
Despite everything that's happened...

05:21.438 --> 05:23.357
I love you.

05:23.485 --> 05:27.933
And I'm asking you, please,
don't let this happen.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.110
This doesn't make any sense.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.031
It doesn't make sense
to you because...

05:32.125 --> 05:35.772
you haven't seen what I've seen.

05:35.870 --> 05:38.716
You don't understand.

05:38.814 --> 05:42.941
I know you think what happened to you
is the government's fault and maybe it is.

05:43.036 --> 05:46.685
- But the people who are going to die are innocent.
- And that is tragic, Jane.

05:46.781 --> 05:49.183
But it has to happen
for things to change...

05:49.308 --> 05:51.196
and they must change.

05:51.324 --> 05:54.909
How can you do something like this?

05:55.003 --> 05:57.308
I'm doing it for your sake.

05:57.406 --> 05:59.676
- For "my" sake?
- For you...

05:59.772 --> 06:03.292
and your children, and after it's all over,
the world will be a better place.

06:03.387 --> 06:05.596
Please, Dad.

06:07.805 --> 06:10.076
Please.

06:11.709 --> 06:15.931
Please, don't do this.

06:16.030 --> 06:21.435
Jane, I don't expect you to understand now.
But one day you will.

06:21.534 --> 06:24.441
And you'll look back,
and you'll thank me for what I've done.

06:27.836 --> 06:32.218
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.108
Jane. Jane!

06:36.797 --> 06:38.619
Jane.

06:42.971 --> 06:45.179
We're on the move.
Get the choppers ready.

06:50.169 --> 06:54.394
Hello.

06:54.490 --> 06:58.138
- Sherry, it's David.
- Hello, David.

06:58.234 --> 07:01.627
I've been thinking things over.
What Keeler offered to you.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.609
How did you put it...
"a seat at the table"?

07:03.708 --> 07:06.393
Yeah. Something like that.

07:06.489 --> 07:08.857
Well, there may be
a seat at "my" table.

07:08.986 --> 07:13.113
- It's a little too late for that, David.
- Sherry...

07:13.211 --> 07:17.625
I think it's in both our best interests
for you to hear what I have to offer.

07:17.754 --> 07:19.865
All right. I'm listening.

07:19.963 --> 07:23.737
- No. Not on the phone. In person.
- Where then?

07:23.832 --> 07:27.192
- At Latham Park, the old baseball field.
- I know it.

07:27.321 --> 07:29.018
Good. I'll meet you there
in 25 minutes.

07:29.113 --> 07:32.889
- That's short notice, David.
- But you will be there.

07:33.016 --> 07:37.626
- You're in no position to be making demands here.
- I have a schedule to keep.

07:37.719 --> 07:40.217
If I start changing things around,
it will attract attention.

07:40.345 --> 07:42.362
And I don't think
either one of us wants that.

07:42.489 --> 07:45.656
All right, David.
I'll hear what you have to say.

07:45.753 --> 07:47.577
Fine.

07:54.394 --> 07:56.728
Yeah.

07:56.823 --> 08:00.601
- She should be leaving soon to meet me.
- I knew she'd go for it.

08:00.728 --> 08:04.536
Oh, she's enjoying having me over a barrel.
I could hear it in her voice.

08:04.665 --> 08:06.456
Don't worry about that, David.

08:06.552 --> 08:09.945
If we can find this prescription bottle,
all her leverage is gone.

08:10.070 --> 08:11.576
How long will you need in the house?

08:11.705 --> 08:14.999
The more time we have,
the better our chance of finding it.

08:15.097 --> 08:16.823
I'll do whatever I can
to keep her there with me.

08:16.921 --> 08:19.384
- All right.
- Wayne...

08:19.512 --> 08:21.112
find it!

08:49.143 --> 08:52.215
Take a look at your handiwork.

08:52.308 --> 08:54.423
You murdered these people,
Stephen. Whole families!

08:54.519 --> 08:58.358
Sometimes a fire needs to be lit in order
to put out another fire.

08:58.487 --> 09:01.334
I don't wanna hear your justification.
This is over!

09:01.429 --> 09:03.926
You are gonna tell me
how to find the rest of the vials now!

09:04.054 --> 09:08.855
Or you'll send me inside the hotel?
I'm prepared to die for my cause, Jack.

09:11.639 --> 09:14.484
Yeah, I know. Chase.

09:14.583 --> 09:16.277
- Yeah, Jack?
- Come in.

09:16.374 --> 09:18.645
Copy that.

09:40.469 --> 09:42.292
What are you doing, Jack?

09:47.414 --> 09:50.485
- Why did you bring me here?
- Ask your father. It's up to him.

09:50.579 --> 09:52.403
Dad?

09:53.875 --> 09:56.020
Tell me how to find
your couriers, Stephen...

09:56.118 --> 09:58.228
or I am going to put
your daughter in that building.

09:58.323 --> 10:00.820
You wouldn't dare.
She has nothing to do with this!

10:00.948 --> 10:03.540
Neither do the people in those body bags.
I am going to do everything I have to...

10:03.635 --> 10:06.741
- to stop you from releasing more of this virus.
- How could you do this?

10:06.835 --> 10:09.907
- I'm gonna give you one chance.
- No, you're not.

10:11.795 --> 10:15.891
- Tell me how I find them.
- You know you can't do this, Jack.

10:15.988 --> 10:19.571
- "You are a government agent."
- Send her in.

10:20.851 --> 10:25.105
- Take her inside! Now!
- No. Dad, stop them.

10:25.204 --> 10:28.499
Dad, stop them! Stop it!

10:28.628 --> 10:30.932
Stop it! Dad, please!

10:31.026 --> 10:34.900
- No! No! No!
- Jane.

10:35.029 --> 10:38.933
- Dad!
- Everything that happens to
your daughter is because of you.

10:39.058 --> 10:42.420
Stop them! Stop it!
Get your hands off... -

10:42.549 --> 10:45.874
- Get her out of there, Jack.
- Get off of me! Dad, please!

10:46.003 --> 10:48.528
- Bauer, get her out of there...
- Where are the vials?

10:48.658 --> 10:51.859
- Get her out of there!
- How do I find the vials?
- Dad!

10:51.952 --> 10:55.505
Let her go! Do as I say now, Jack!

10:55.603 --> 10:59.219
When your daughter is infected,
I'm going to make you watch her die.

10:59.315 --> 11:01.970
Let her go!

11:02.067 --> 11:04.660
Let her go.

11:04.753 --> 11:06.546
You're running out of time, Stephen.

11:06.642 --> 11:08.979
Jack!

11:09.074 --> 11:11.923
- "Jack!"
- Stephen, you're out of time!

11:12.017 --> 11:14.257
Stop! Stop! Stop!
I'll tell you!

11:14.354 --> 11:18.001
Just don't harm her!

11:23.058 --> 11:24.881
How do I find the vials?

11:28.272 --> 11:31.442
Each one is tagged with
a G.P.S. Locator chip...

11:31.537 --> 11:35.187
so that I could track them, right up until
the moment they were released.

11:35.281 --> 11:39.983
- Where are the locator codes?
- In my head.

11:40.082 --> 11:45.681
- You memorized all 11?
- Yeah. Get her out of there.

11:47.503 --> 11:51.759
Bring Jane out from
the tunnel now. Let's go.

12:13.008 --> 12:18.415
Jack, we picked up 10 of the 11
G.P.S. signals coming off the vials.

12:18.511 --> 12:22.384
- Why are we missing a signal?
- I don't know. I gave you the correct codes.

12:22.510 --> 12:24.848
- Where's the 11 th vial?
- Los Angeles.

12:24.941 --> 12:28.944
- What's the target?
- His instructions were to select a public place...

12:29.039 --> 12:30.895
where maximum casualties
would be inflicted.

12:30.991 --> 12:33.454
- What's his name?
- I know him as Arthur Rabens.

12:33.582 --> 12:36.816
- But I'm assuming that's not his real name.
- "We need a description."

12:36.912 --> 12:39.086
Take him back to holding over at C.T.U.

12:39.184 --> 12:42.094
- I want him working with
a sketch artist immediately.

12:42.223 --> 12:44.913
- What aboutJane?
- She stays here.

12:54.702 --> 12:56.335
- Kaufman.
- Adam, it's Jack.

12:56.431 --> 12:59.823
I need you to do an all-agency search
on the name Arthur Rabens.

12:59.949 --> 13:02.606
- Saunders believes it might be an alias.
- Okay. I'm on it, Jack.

13:02.703 --> 13:04.654
Has District sent anyone over
to replace Tony?

13:04.783 --> 13:07.503
Actually, yeah.
Brad Hammond just got here right now.

13:07.598 --> 13:09.391
- Okay. Let me speak to him.
- One second.

13:09.485 --> 13:12.462
Mr. Hammond. I have
Jack Bauer for you on line six.

13:14.925 --> 13:18.382
Jack... I've been briefed on
C.T.U. Activity to this point.

13:18.510 --> 13:21.196
We're relaying the coordinates of
the 10 vials to local police...

13:21.295 --> 13:23.020
N.H.S. And HazMat across the country.

13:23.118 --> 13:25.804
We still can't lock on
a signal for the 11 th vial.

13:25.902 --> 13:28.811
The 11 th vial is in Los Angeles.
The courier's name is Arthur Rabens.

13:28.940 --> 13:32.878
Although Saunders believes that that might be
an alias. There's no predetermined target.

13:33.006 --> 13:34.413
Think he's telling the truth?

13:34.509 --> 13:36.781
He thinks we're willing to kill his daughter
if he doesn't cooperate.

13:36.877 --> 13:39.052
But our best bet
is to lock onto that signal.

13:39.149 --> 13:41.133
I understand everyone
in Comm is working on it.

13:41.261 --> 13:45.675
Brad, I know you took
Tony Almeida into custody...

13:45.803 --> 13:48.523
but now that his wife is safe,
I think he might be a real asset to us.

13:50.634 --> 13:53.388
I'm sorry, Jack, but there's not
going to be any special treatment.

13:53.483 --> 13:55.341
For God's sakes, Brad.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.957
Four and half years ago, I was put in
the exact same position Tony was put in today.

13:59.052 --> 14:03.499
Victor Drazen kidnapped my wife
and daughter, and I went outside
of C.T.U. To get them back...

14:03.629 --> 14:06.444
- and no one put me in prison.
- The circumstances were different.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.845
And the outcome will be the same.
We will prevail.

14:08.940 --> 14:11.629
The entire operation was put at risk
because of what he did.

14:11.724 --> 14:15.370
This operation started a year ago
with Gael, Tony and myself.

14:15.469 --> 14:16.940
Gael gave his life.

14:17.069 --> 14:19.978
I became an addict to maintain my cover.
Now you're sending Tony to prison?

14:20.107 --> 14:22.762
It's wrong.
Brad, it's wrong, and you know it.

14:22.860 --> 14:25.353
You should be putting
a medal on him, not handcuffs.

14:25.482 --> 14:29.579
Jack, you can testify at his hearing.
Right now, we've got work to do.

14:31.531 --> 14:33.706
Kim, any new data you've got
I need transferred to...

15:15.850 --> 15:18.441
- Where's Michelle?
- She's here.

15:18.536 --> 15:22.409
- Could I talk to her, please?
- First things first.

15:22.539 --> 15:27.241
Plachecki's coming over from the attorney
general's office to take your official statement.

15:27.336 --> 15:31.754
- You're entitled to have a lawyer present.
- Look, I don't need a lawyer.

15:31.882 --> 15:36.456
- I did what I did.
- What you did is punishable
by the death penalty.

15:39.657 --> 15:43.880
- Death penalty.
- What did you expect? You committed treason.

15:46.152 --> 15:48.998
- That was not my intent.
- You facilitated the escape...

15:49.097 --> 15:52.551
of a man who is responsible for
the death of Ryan Chappelle...

15:52.681 --> 15:58.279
and almost a thousand civilians and who
was contemplating killing millions of others.

15:58.377 --> 16:02.921
Then you tried to neutralize the only leverage
we had over him by giving him back his daughter.

16:07.176 --> 16:09.000
So what's the bottom line?

16:13.511 --> 16:17.255
I will testify to the fact that
your service record is long...

16:17.351 --> 16:19.335
and, for the most part, distinguished.

16:19.463 --> 16:23.783
With luck, the best
you can hope for is 20 years.

16:36.966 --> 16:39.239
- "Sherry should've left by now."
- "Yeah."

16:39.334 --> 16:43.366
Well, she's taking her time,
so she can make the president wait.

16:48.871 --> 16:50.791
- Wayne Palmer.
- Wayne.

16:50.916 --> 16:55.143
- I told you not to call me.
- I don't have anyone else.

16:55.236 --> 16:57.734
I'm sorry,
but I can't help you right now.

16:57.862 --> 17:01.156
The police are coming back
to arrest me, Wayne...

17:01.286 --> 17:05.540
for murdering Alan,
because they don't believe that Sherry was here.

17:05.670 --> 17:08.836
- I know what happened.
- Then why didn't you tell them the truth?

17:08.935 --> 17:12.964
My-My lawyer says that-that the president
is backing Sherry's story?

17:15.237 --> 17:18.020
Is it true? Is your brother
covering for Sherry?

17:19.943 --> 17:23.142
- I... I don't know, Julia.
- D-Don't lie to me.

17:23.237 --> 17:26.404
Listen. I'm sorry, but there's nothing
I can do for you right now.

17:28.355 --> 17:31.655
Please, just don't-don't hang up.

17:31.749 --> 17:33.924
I'll call you as soon as I can.
I promise.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.965
Wayne?

17:42.117 --> 17:44.965
No. L-I'm so scared.

17:45.060 --> 17:49.411
- I know.
- We loved each other once.

17:49.540 --> 17:51.426
Help me.

17:52.709 --> 17:55.395
- I have to go, Julia.
- Wayne.

17:55.494 --> 17:57.604
I'm sorry.

18:30.212 --> 18:32.226
All right.

18:45.953 --> 18:48.321
I'm chief of staff to the president of
the United States...

18:48.449 --> 18:53.057
- and I'm committing a burglary.
- It's an historic moment.

18:53.155 --> 18:55.394
Foxton, Sherry
can never know we were here.

18:55.489 --> 18:58.114
You do what I say and she won't.
Let's get to work.

19:02.147 --> 19:05.922
Jack, this is the tactical feed
from San Francisco.

19:06.051 --> 19:08.578
They're apprehending Saunders's courier.

19:08.706 --> 19:10.179
- " He's not breathing."
- " He's been neutralized."

19:10.307 --> 19:12.387
- The sniper took him down with a head shot.
- Got it.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.402
- " Is the vial intact?"
- " Stand by."

19:18.530 --> 19:20.577
Field Ops, I repeat, is the vial intact?

19:20.706 --> 19:22.914
Vial appears intact.

19:24.803 --> 19:27.776
We've got it. The vial is intact.
Repeat, we have the vial.

19:27.904 --> 19:29.921
One down, 10 to go.

19:50.530 --> 19:53.502
- Did you check the kitchen?
- Yeah, for the second time.

19:53.632 --> 19:55.904
There is nothing there.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.847
Looks like Mrs. Palmer believes in
better living through chemistry...

19:58.943 --> 20:03.199
- but none of the bottles are Alan Milliken's.
- Damn it.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.303
Relax. If she's hidden it here,
we'll find it.

20:06.433 --> 20:10.560
- How can you be so sure?
- 'Cause she's not a professional and I am.

20:28.735 --> 20:31.422
- Sherry.
- David.

20:31.520 --> 20:35.584
- Let's take a walk.
- Well, actually, I just wanted to get to the point.

20:35.678 --> 20:37.887
What is it that you've decided?

20:41.310 --> 20:46.046
I've decided to give you what you want.
A place in my administration.

20:46.174 --> 20:48.446
Well, that's what
you implied over the phone...

20:48.542 --> 20:52.829
but I thought I was here so that
you could be a little more specific.

20:55.935 --> 21:01.310
You will be my de facto right hand,
involved in all major decisions.

21:01.439 --> 21:05.120
- Involved how?
- On everything from
ambassadorial appointments...

21:05.213 --> 21:06.655
to legislative proposals.

21:06.781 --> 21:10.429
You will be one of my
primary consultants.

21:10.525 --> 21:14.299
One of your consultants?

21:14.398 --> 21:19.006
- Right.
- Good-bye, David.

21:19.101 --> 21:20.988
What?
Where are you going?

21:21.086 --> 21:23.837
Back home because
this conversation is over.

21:23.933 --> 21:26.301
- Why?
- That's just not good enough.

21:26.428 --> 21:28.894
I am not going to be relegated
to some informal role...

21:29.020 --> 21:31.229
so that you can ignore
me whenever you choose.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.627
Why don't you just
tell me what you want?

21:33.726 --> 21:38.748
I want a permanent position,
David. In your administration...

21:38.843 --> 21:41.147
and in your life.

21:41.245 --> 21:42.939
I don't understand.

21:44.382 --> 21:46.939
I want to be your wife again.

21:47.996 --> 21:49.852
You what?

21:49.950 --> 21:55.132
I don't expect to have the kind of
physical intimacy that we used to have.

21:55.228 --> 21:57.596
Although maybe in time that'll come.

21:59.101 --> 22:03.227
But I really want to be
Mrs. David Palmer again.

22:03.322 --> 22:07.933
The first lady. Right by your side
in Washington wherever you go.

22:18.169 --> 22:21.053
Sherry, I don't know what to say.

22:21.180 --> 22:24.635
Well, you can start by saying yes.

22:24.764 --> 22:27.098
Or I walk for good.

22:30.233 --> 22:32.987
Are you prepared to
have me be your wife again?

22:52.472 --> 22:54.810
Yes.

22:56.123 --> 22:58.392
Really?

23:00.315 --> 23:02.138
Oh, David.

23:06.488 --> 23:08.379
Oh, God.

23:19.546 --> 23:23.480
We should talk about the details.
Work out a timeline.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.977
How we expose this to the public.

23:33.850 --> 23:35.672
Wait a minute.

23:38.551 --> 23:42.200
No. I know you a little better
than this, David.

23:42.296 --> 23:45.273
Something's not right here.
You're making this all too easy.

23:45.401 --> 23:47.831
There's something else going on.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.168
I'm giving you what you asked for.

23:50.263 --> 23:52.089
No, no. No, you're not.

23:54.360 --> 23:55.223
You're toying with me.

23:56.535 --> 23:58.552
And I don't know why
and, frankly, I don't care.

23:58.680 --> 24:03.287
You... You just consider
my offer rescinded.

24:03.386 --> 24:08.022
John Keeler will be the next president
of the United States.

24:25.463 --> 24:28.280
Yeah?

24:28.375 --> 24:29.816
She's on her way back.

24:29.942 --> 24:33.078
David, we need more time.
We haven't found anything yet.

24:33.176 --> 24:37.525
Look, I tried to keep her here as long
as I could, but she knew something was wrong.

24:37.654 --> 24:40.824
- Wayne, you should leave.
- We're not done.

24:40.919 --> 24:43.446
She will be there soon.
You have no choice.

24:54.423 --> 24:55.925
David, hold on.

25:06.198 --> 25:09.876
- There's a safe.
- David, we found a safe in a hidden cellar.

25:09.974 --> 25:12.501
- Can you open it in time?
- Can you get in?

25:12.630 --> 25:15.381
It's an Evans-Stoller, uh,
so forget about cracking it.

25:15.478 --> 25:18.580
But all these electronic safes
have manufacturer override codes.

25:18.678 --> 25:20.885
I have a guy who can get 'em for us.
One of'em will work.

25:20.982 --> 25:25.492
- How long?
- Depends on how long it takes
to get him on the phone.

25:25.591 --> 25:27.028
David, we may have just found a way.

25:27.157 --> 25:30.357
You better. You're running out of time.

25:30.451 --> 25:34.582
The suspect has used a titanium
clamp to secure the device to a railing.

25:34.678 --> 25:37.075
We're defusing on-site.
Wilson, what is your status?

25:37.203 --> 25:41.141
Suspect in custody. New York HazMat
is en route. Virus is contained.

25:41.270 --> 25:43.637
- Yeah.
- Seattle, Las Vegas secure.

25:43.732 --> 25:46.229
- Denver courier taken down making a phone call.
- Okay. Hold on.

25:46.357 --> 25:49.013
Jack, we got the couriers in Las Vegas
and Seattle without incident.

25:49.109 --> 25:51.476
Saunders's man in Denver was making
a phone call when he was killed.

25:51.605 --> 25:53.621
- Did he complete the call?
Warn the other couriers?
- We don't know.

25:53.749 --> 25:56.053
- We gotta find that out.
- "Tactical to L.A. Tactical to L.A."

25:56.148 --> 25:59.060
This is Phoenix info.
Vial is secure. We are secure.

25:59.189 --> 26:01.940
Chloe, I'm getting level-two sat
transmission from the L.A. Grid.

26:02.035 --> 26:05.461
- Are you sure? What are the coordinates?
- Alpha-1733 at Delta-401.

26:05.586 --> 26:07.923
- That's downtown. Lock in on the sat feed.
- "It's done."

26:08.019 --> 26:10.387
- Transfer to my screen.
- Okay.

26:19.602 --> 26:21.107
- This is Jack.
- Jack, it's Chloe.

26:21.236 --> 26:24.372
- What do you got?
- Saunders is telling the truth. Rabens is in L.A.

26:24.466 --> 26:26.932
- Where?
- He's on South Flower, heading northwest.

26:27.058 --> 26:29.299
We got a location.

26:29.395 --> 26:33.075
Extrapolate his path. Cross-reference it
with a list of probable public targets.

26:33.170 --> 26:35.538
Already done. The most likely match
is the California Center.

26:35.666 --> 26:39.314
A mall makes sense. Get units over there
to evacuate and secure the area.

26:39.412 --> 26:42.034
We're on our way.

26:50.643 --> 26:55.346
No, they're not right. Lighten the eyes.

27:03.699 --> 27:06.640
I just tried to see Tony.
Security said you're denying me access?

27:06.769 --> 27:10.034
- He's a prisoner, Michelle.
- I'm his wife. He did what
he did to save my life.

27:10.129 --> 27:13.552
I am aware of that. Because of that
he's being charged with treason.

27:16.018 --> 27:18.386
Treason? Brad, look.

27:18.481 --> 27:20.880
I know that he broke protocol
by taking Jane Saunders out of C.T.U...

27:21.008 --> 27:23.058
- but he would never have given her up.
- Michelle.

27:23.184 --> 27:26.289
- And because of him,
we were able to catch Saunders.
- We had Saunders two hours ago.

27:26.384 --> 27:29.807
And Tony let him escape.

27:29.936 --> 27:34.000
No one told you? We had Saunders
trapped in a building downtown.

27:34.096 --> 27:36.847
We were ready to drop the net...

27:36.945 --> 27:40.047
and Tony pulled units out of position,
so Saunders could get away.

27:44.079 --> 27:46.928
- Brad, it was an impossible choice.
- No, it wasn't.

27:48.559 --> 27:51.694
Tony has a sworn duty to protect
the people of this country.

27:51.792 --> 27:53.999
Putting your life first was treasonous.

27:54.096 --> 27:56.594
And he's going to prison for it.

27:59.567 --> 28:01.806
- "Brad..."
- I want you to put yourself
in his place, Michelle.

28:01.904 --> 28:06.159
If you would've made the same call,
you should resign right now.

28:14.127 --> 28:16.911
Target is still moving north
at 40 miles per hour.

28:17.006 --> 28:20.494
- How long till we intercept?
- About a minute.

28:20.623 --> 28:22.415
How are we doing on
the other vials?

28:22.509 --> 28:24.878
They got the Flagstaff couriers
and the other two in Washington.

28:24.975 --> 28:26.958
Rabens is the last one.

28:27.087 --> 28:29.743
Okay, make your next right.
You should be coming up right behind him.

28:29.839 --> 28:31.375
Okay. I'm turning right onto Flower.

28:36.048 --> 28:39.342
The target is less than a block ahead of you.
You should have a visual.

28:39.438 --> 28:41.710
Chloe, there's no vehicles within range.

28:41.806 --> 28:43.500
Are you sure the target's still in a vehicle?

28:43.598 --> 28:46.478
Of course, he's traveling
40 miles per hour. You're closing.

28:46.606 --> 28:49.710
- Target is less than 50 feet ahead of you.
- No cars in front of us.

28:49.806 --> 28:52.719
You need to recheck your signals.
It's not possible.

28:54.607 --> 28:57.357
Yes, it is. He's underneath us.

28:57.455 --> 28:59.374
Chloe, the target's on the subway.

28:59.502 --> 29:01.999
Can you access the M.T.A.'s
disaster response system?

29:02.127 --> 29:04.142
Yes, we can access
their control center directly.

29:04.268 --> 29:07.437
Okay, we need to stop the train in
the tunnel before it hits the station.

29:07.532 --> 29:09.420
Logging on to their system.

29:11.405 --> 29:13.676
Has Adam been able to
turn up a photo on Rabens yet?

29:13.774 --> 29:17.163
No, and Saunders hasn't completed
the identity sketch.

29:17.293 --> 29:21.068
They're accepting my request to stop the train
in the tunnel just short of the station.

29:21.166 --> 29:22.990
Do you want me to tell
M.T.A. to close the station?

29:23.083 --> 29:25.421
Absolutely not. If Rabens notices
anything out of the ordinary...

29:25.516 --> 29:27.181
he might release the virus.

29:27.276 --> 29:31.532
I'm gonna need 20 personnel undercover
and a backup HazMat team A.S.A.P.

29:31.661 --> 29:35.915
Okay. We've got men nearby.
I'll tell Hammond to order the redeployment.

29:38.571 --> 29:42.444
Yeah, Foxton here.

29:42.573 --> 29:44.778
- " Got those codes for the safe."
- "Okay. Give me the first one."

29:44.877 --> 29:48.300
- Six, seven, six, seven, six, five, "B."
- Six, seven, six, seven...

29:48.430 --> 29:51.500
six, five, "B."

29:51.596 --> 29:54.028
- That didn't work. You got another one?
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

29:54.156 --> 29:56.075
"Two, two, eight, seven, six, seven."

29:56.203 --> 29:58.026
Did you hear that?

29:59.596 --> 30:01.963
"It was a car."

30:11.436 --> 30:13.642
No.

30:15.884 --> 30:18.540
- Sherry's here.
- Look, I need you to be quiet.

30:18.635 --> 30:20.428
- We need to get the hell out of here!
- Quiet!

30:20.523 --> 30:24.204
- "The next one."
- The next one. Three, five, two, six, six...

30:24.298 --> 30:27.305
- Damn it, Foxton! Come on!
- Got it.

30:33.195 --> 30:36.395
- It's not here.
- Damn it. All right. Come on.

30:40.844 --> 30:43.594
- That's it. Let's go.
- What?

30:43.689 --> 30:46.988
I didn't come this far
to leave empty-handed.

30:50.793 --> 30:56.010
Wayne. What's going on here?

30:58.411 --> 31:02.985
Answer me. What... Oh.

31:03.083 --> 31:05.737
Oh, now I understand
why David wanted to meet me.

31:05.833 --> 31:10.346
But I am so surprised
to find you here doing his dirty work.

31:10.441 --> 31:12.779
I've never done anything
to hurt you, Wayne.

31:12.873 --> 31:15.563
- David put you up to this, didn't he?
- Sherry, l...

31:15.657 --> 31:18.314
Answer me. David put...

31:44.361 --> 31:46.665
The eyebrows.
Change the eyebrows.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.658
We apologize for the inconvenience.

32:03.974 --> 32:06.952
Attention passengers.
Southbound service has been...

32:07.080 --> 32:10.376
temporarily suspended
due to a stalled train.

32:10.504 --> 32:13.190
We apologize for any inconvenience.

32:17.639 --> 32:21.255
- " Chase, what's your location?"
- I'm covering the east side.

32:21.351 --> 32:24.648
- " Copy that."
- "Chase, I've got a visual"
on you coming down the stairs.

32:28.072 --> 32:29.895
Everything in place
with the M.T. A?

32:29.989 --> 32:31.877
They're ready to move the train
into the station.

32:33.159 --> 32:35.781
Teams "A" and "B,"
are you in position?

32:35.879 --> 32:39.175
- " Roger. We are in position."
- "Rabens's description.'mid-30s..."

32:39.303 --> 32:42.663
white male, dark hair,
brown eyes...nondescript.

32:42.790 --> 32:47.686
- Chloe, release the train.
- Release the hold on the train. Release the train.

32:49.669 --> 32:51.143
Attention passengers.

32:51.268 --> 32:55.399
We are currently experiencing
a short delay on the Blue Line.

32:55.494 --> 32:58.822
"Normal service will resume shortly."

33:31.074 --> 33:33.254
Train doors are opening.

33:37.732 --> 33:40.709
- Target is moving off the train.
- North or south?

33:40.835 --> 33:43.653
- North.
- Target is moving north.

33:43.748 --> 33:45.635
All teams remain in your zones.

33:51.269 --> 33:53.795
Long Beach train. Next stop, Pico.

33:53.924 --> 33:55.876
Attention passengers.

33:56.005 --> 33:59.205
We are currently experiencing
a short delay on the Blue Line.

33:59.297 --> 34:02.306
Normal service will resume shortly.

34:04.068 --> 34:05.604
- Chloe.
- Go ahead.

34:05.730 --> 34:09.380
- Can you check the altitude on a G.P.S. Signal?
- If I triangulate.

34:09.475 --> 34:12.610
Positive. Target is changing altitude.

34:12.706 --> 34:14.786
Target's moving up the stairs.

34:16.068 --> 34:18.114
Got 10 remaining white males.

34:19.908 --> 34:21.795
Attention passengers.

34:21.891 --> 34:25.188
There will be a short delay...

34:26.882 --> 34:29.859
Target is now moving west.

34:32.704 --> 34:36.226
Team "A," split off and maintain pace.

34:36.355 --> 34:39.554
Target is now moving south.

34:39.650 --> 34:42.946
- Target is now descending.
- He's heading to the 7 th Street exit.

34:43.043 --> 34:45.060
Coming right toward you, Jack.

34:50.882 --> 34:52.770
Target is heading south.

34:52.867 --> 34:56.931
I've got a visual.
Four, white remaining males.

35:00.641 --> 35:02.657
I want all teams to start closing in.

35:02.786 --> 35:05.154
I repeat, all teams start closing in.

35:09.890 --> 35:12.864
- What have you got, Chloe?
- Target is now moving west.

35:14.945 --> 35:18.720
Target has stopped moving.
The target has stopped.

35:23.555 --> 35:26.878
I have identification on the target.
White male at my 6:00.

35:27.007 --> 35:30.306
He's looking at the map.
I'm initiating takedown.

35:36.545 --> 35:39.040
Drop the bag.
Get on the ground now! Don't move!

35:39.170 --> 35:40.576
- What's going on?
- Where is it?

35:40.672 --> 35:42.176
- "Wh-Where's what?"
- Where is it?

35:42.305 --> 35:43.742
- "Where's what?"
- "Chase."

35:43.872 --> 35:45.824
"What are you guys doing? What's going on?"

35:45.953 --> 35:48.161
Jack, I got a signal.
Should we wait for HazMat?

35:48.257 --> 35:51.070
No. It's either in the vial
or we're already contaminated.

35:51.168 --> 35:52.769
What is this?

35:54.913 --> 35:58.303
- Don't move.
- No passing through.

36:05.247 --> 36:07.552
- " Let's stay back."
- Those aren't mine. I don't even smoke...

36:07.646 --> 36:09.055
Shut up!

36:12.382 --> 36:15.232
- " I need you all to stay back, please."
- "Son of a bitch."

36:15.326 --> 36:18.238
It's just a transmitter. This isn't Rabens.
He knows we're on to him.

36:18.367 --> 36:21.632
He's still got the vial.
Shut the station down now!

36:36.316 --> 36:38.975
Julia. Stay here. I'll be right back.

36:39.070 --> 36:41.790
- Where are you going?
- Just stay here.

36:50.365 --> 36:52.413
Julia, what are you doing here?

36:52.542 --> 36:54.175
The police think I killed Alan.

36:54.301 --> 36:57.629
Well, I told you to keep your mouth shut.

36:57.758 --> 36:59.709
It's nobody's fault but your own.

37:02.686 --> 37:07.229
What are you doing with a gun?
You don't wanna do this.

37:07.324 --> 37:10.717
I'm going to jail for the rest of my life
because of you.

37:10.846 --> 37:13.694
Julia! Julia!

37:13.790 --> 37:17.565
That's not true, Julia.
No. Wayne, relax. We're all right here.

37:17.660 --> 37:20.572
- You gotta put that gun down.
- No. No!

37:20.701 --> 37:24.158
She's the one
who should be going to jail.

37:24.283 --> 37:26.813
My life is ruined.
Don't you understand that?

37:26.941 --> 37:30.395
Julia, please. We can... We can
work this out, honey.

37:30.524 --> 37:32.412
He's right. We can work it out.

37:32.541 --> 37:35.516
Shut up. Shut up.

37:35.643 --> 37:38.491
You have been lying your entire life.
You are not gonna lie your way out of this.

37:38.589 --> 37:42.331
You're right. But right now, Julia...

37:42.429 --> 37:44.283
I am telling you the truth.

37:44.381 --> 37:47.548
Now, I will go to David,
and he will pardon you.

37:47.644 --> 37:50.620
I-I was just with him, just now.

37:50.747 --> 37:54.524
I'm gonna be his wife again.
He'll do whatever I say.

37:57.658 --> 38:02.364
I promise you...
You will not spend one day in jail.

38:03.355 --> 38:05.531
Isn't that so, Wayne?

38:08.603 --> 38:11.867
Julia, listen. You'll have everything
you've always wanted.

38:11.962 --> 38:15.131
You'll have your freedom.

38:15.226 --> 38:18.011
You'll have Alan's estate.

38:18.105 --> 38:21.627
You just think about it, sweetie.

38:22.652 --> 38:24.569
I promise.

38:26.937 --> 38:31.227
You'll be set for life. G-Good. Good.
Now that's real good.

38:33.530 --> 38:35.898
That's good.

38:44.476 --> 38:47.227
Oh, my God. Sherry.

38:50.138 --> 38:52.250
Sherry.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.618
I'm so sorry.

39:00.825 --> 39:02.523
No!

39:08.632 --> 39:11.833
God, no. Please.

39:11.927 --> 39:12.858
Please.

39:27.576 --> 39:30.553
- Take up position at the end of the platform.
- "Okay."

39:32.536 --> 39:35.993
- Jack. We've detained everyone at the station.
- We shut it down in time?

39:36.118 --> 39:37.944
- No one's left since the train came in.
- Set up a team.

39:38.040 --> 39:39.928
We'll start searching the tunnels.
