00:04.600 --> 00:06.955
I feel bad for the silver-medal winner
in the Olympics.

00:07.120 --> 00:08.997
I mean, how do you live with that?

00:09.160 --> 00:12.516
"How much did you lose by?"
I don't even know.

00:12.680 --> 00:16.878
It was like from now to now.
Now to now. Now, now, now."

00:17.720 --> 00:19.597
It was...and that was it, I lost.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.671
I trained, I worked out, I exercised.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.159
I was doing pushups, sit-ups.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.311
I never did anything but exercise
for 20 years.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.391
I flew halfway around the world....

00:29.920 --> 00:33.390
And that was that.
It was a photo finish.

00:33.760 --> 00:35.637
Silver, gold.

00:36.480 --> 00:39.199
"lf I had a pimple, I would have won."

00:43.480 --> 00:45.710
Can't believe you write
for the J. Peterman catalogue.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.475
Get this one,
"l packed my rod and reel.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.074
Thirty hours later, lost in the fjord...

00:52.240 --> 00:53.719
...a welcoming smile.

00:53.880 --> 00:58.192
Thank God she spotted the epaulets
on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest."

00:59.160 --> 01:01.720
This catalogue is all about
how to score in a foreign country.

01:01.880 --> 01:04.110
-Yeah, what do you do all day?
-Not that much.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.994
I thought that new promotion
was supposed to be more work?

01:07.160 --> 01:08.309
When the season starts.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.357
Right now, I sit around
pretending I'm busy.

01:10.520 --> 01:13.751
-How do you pull that off?
-I always look annoyed.

01:14.800 --> 01:18.634
When you look annoyed all the time,
people think that you're busy.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.752
Think about it.

01:24.720 --> 01:25.709
Yeah, you do.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.313
-He looks busy.
-He looks very busy.

01:27.480 --> 01:28.833
I know what I'm doing.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.719
In fact, Mr. Wilhelm gave me
one of those little stress dolls.

01:31.880 --> 01:34.997
All right. Back to work.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.032
So did you come up
with a stupid story...

01:40.200 --> 01:41.952
...for the Himalayan
walking shoe yet?

01:42.120 --> 01:44.270
No, I'm completely blocked.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.954
In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.599
Oh, no.

01:48.760 --> 01:52.753
I can't. I got that marathon runner
coming in tonight.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.148
What marathon runner?

01:54.320 --> 01:56.117
You know, this guy, Jean-Paul...?

01:56.280 --> 01:58.157
I met him when I was
working at Pendant...

01:58.320 --> 01:59.639
...editing a book on running.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.520
-Oh, wait Jean-Paul Jean-Paul.
-Yes.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.750
He overslept at the Olympics
four years ago...

02:04.920 --> 02:07.115
...missed the marathon.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.033
Yeah, that's him.

02:09.199 --> 02:11.156
He's from Trinidad and Tobago,
right?

02:11.320 --> 02:14.437
Yeah, he's
Trinidadian and Tobagan.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.311
How do you oversleep
at the Olympics?

02:18.520 --> 02:20.112
I know. I know.

02:20.280 --> 02:22.032
It's like the biggest event
of your life.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.997
You'd think you'd have
six alarm clocks...

02:24.160 --> 02:26.628
...paying off little kids
to come banging on your door.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.279
Well, he was pretty devastated.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.670
This is his first race in three years.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.071
That's a big responsibility
on your hands.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.630
What responsibility?
I don't have any responsibility.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.155
Well, you gotta wake him up.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.152
He'll get up.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.152
-Hi, Judy.
-Hi, Elaine, how are you?

02:43.320 --> 02:44.594
Fine.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.352
-I've seen her in your building.
-Yeah.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.670
-I didn't know she was married.
-She's not.

02:49.880 --> 02:53.031
And the guy just took off.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.675
-Don't say anything.
-Who am I gonna tell?

02:56.840 --> 02:59.274
I know, it's just something
you have to say.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:10.040 --> 03:12.110
George, we just got
the final budget numbers.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.032
We went over budget
on some of the items...

03:14.200 --> 03:16.714
...but I don't think
there's gonna be a problem.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.472
I'll let you get back to work,
George.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.198
He overslept
and missed the whole race.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.476
-lsn't that amazing?
-I'll tell you what happened.

03:32.640 --> 03:35.154
I bet he got
the a.m.-p.m. mixed up.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.193
My money's on the snooze.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.511
I bet he hit the snooze for an extra five,
and it never came back on.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.436
Imagine, your whole life riding
on an alarm clock.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.558
Alarm clocks? No, I never use them.
Don't trust them.

03:48.720 --> 03:51.359
-What do you do?
-I have a mental alarm.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.909
I set my head
for quarter to 7...

03:54.080 --> 03:56.469
...and...I get up.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.392
-lt always works?
-lt never fails.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.152
See, it's based on your body clock.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.676
Your body has an internal mechanism.
It knows what time it is.

04:04.520 --> 04:08.593
-What's with the bucket?
-Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.512
-Hot tub?
- Yeah, it's in my living room.

04:10.680 --> 04:11.669
I just gotta fill it.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.799
You put a hot tub
in your living room?

04:14.960 --> 04:17.757
It's a beauty. It's got these
high-volume accusage jets...

04:17.920 --> 04:22.471
...oscillating and pulsating,
soothing your every aching muscle.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.837
That water's gonna get
over 120 degrees.

04:26.760 --> 04:30.070
-ls that tolerable?
-Oh, it's tolerable.

04:31.040 --> 04:34.271
Isn't that the same temperature
of the coffee that scalded you?

04:35.200 --> 04:38.192
I think it's a little cooler than that.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.432
He doesn't have any running water?

04:41.600 --> 04:43.511
I don't ask those kind
of questions anymore.

04:45.920 --> 04:46.989
Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.515
-Hi, Jean-Paul, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.116
-Sorry about the Olympics.
-Me too.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.957
Listen, I'm gonna go call work,
see if I can get my deadline extended.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.350
I can't come up
with anything for this thing.

04:59.520 --> 05:00.873
Catalogue-writer's block?

05:01.560 --> 05:03.516
Yeah, that's funny.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.072
So, what happened?

05:12.280 --> 05:14.077
The snooze alarm, wasn't it?

05:14.240 --> 05:15.832
No, man, it wasn't the snooze.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.356
Most people think it was the snooze,
but no, no snooze.

05:19.520 --> 05:23.513
-A.m.-p.m?
-Man, it wasn't the a.m.-p.m.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.033
It was the volume.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.471
-Oh, the volume.
-Yes, the volume.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.154
There was a separate knob
for the radio alarm.

05:31.560 --> 05:35.678
-Oh, separate knob.
-Yeah, separate knob.

05:35.840 --> 05:39.674
Why separate knob!
Why separate knob!

05:39.840 --> 05:43.037
Some people like to have the alarm
a little louder than the radio.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.998
Oh, please, man, please!

05:46.160 --> 05:49.789
It's not gonna happen again.
Not if I have anything to say about it.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.554
Elaine, what's the alarm clock
situation at your house?

05:52.720 --> 05:54.676
-Jerry....
-It's a simple question.

05:54.840 --> 05:57.593
I've got an alarm, okay?

05:57.760 --> 06:00.957
That old one? Didn't I miss a flight
to Cleveland because of that clock?

06:01.120 --> 06:02.872
-Flight to Cleveland?
-lt works.

06:03.040 --> 06:06.112
-Elaine.
-lt works.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.794
"Singing duo, Captain and...."?

06:16.200 --> 06:18.031
Tennille!

06:21.400 --> 06:23.311
Come on.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.479
George...

06:28.640 --> 06:30.870
...I think you may be
taking work too seriously.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.395
Well, I've got a lot to do.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.516
George, I'll tell you
what I'd like you to do.

06:35.680 --> 06:39.195
I'd like you to drop everything.
I have this fun little assignment.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.430
There are some reps in
from the Houston Astros...

06:41.600 --> 06:43.272
...for talks on
that lnterleague Play...

06:43.440 --> 06:45.590
...and I want you
to show them a good time.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.388
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.073
You're 40 minutes late.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.959
-What happened?
-I got held up.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.839
-Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
-No.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.230
What? What is the problem?

07:02.400 --> 07:04.436
You said you were gonna be here
a certain time...

07:04.600 --> 07:06.352
...and you weren't.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.272
And this all means what?

07:09.440 --> 07:11.510
It means that a man
has come from very far away...

07:11.680 --> 07:13.432
...to compete in
a very difficult race...

07:13.600 --> 07:15.909
...put his faith in you,
and I'm a little concerned.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.877
-Oh, are you?
-Yes, I am.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.713
Hey, I'm not running
in the marathon, he is.

07:20.880 --> 07:21.949
-Yeah, I know that.
-Yeah.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.634
I've got enough to think about
trying to come up with...

07:24.800 --> 07:26.711
...some crap for that
Himalayan walking shoe.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.110
I've given him a place to stay,
I'll set an alarm...

07:29.280 --> 07:31.748
...but I'm not gonna turn my life
completely upside down.

07:31.920 --> 07:35.833
I'm not talking about upside down,
I'm talking about waking him up.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.952
Hey, Jean-Paul.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.632
Jean-Paul, how was your soak?
A good soak?

07:40.800 --> 07:44.634
Oh, man, very good soak.
The soak of the year.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.197
What's burning?

07:48.160 --> 07:49.912
My muffin.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.154
Shoot.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.878
-What happened?
-I don't know.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.519
I set this thing for 20 seconds.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.399
This was for two minutes, see?

07:58.560 --> 07:59.834
Don't say anything.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.911
Don't say anything.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.150
You mis-set the timer?

08:05.080 --> 08:08.152
Jean-Paul, it's not
my microwave, okay? Okay?

08:08.320 --> 08:10.550
All right, listen, let's just go.
Come on, Jean-Paul.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.517
-Let's go.
-Okay.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.750
-We'll see you at the race, okay?
-Yeah, I hope so.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.478
Oh, that's cute.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.359
Kramer, I'm telling you,
Elaine doesn't know what she's doing.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.034
I gotta take over
this whole operation.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.237
Jerry, look how tense you are.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.470
You need to take a soak.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.029
I'm not taking a soak...

08:31.200 --> 08:34.351
...in that human bacteria frappe
you got going there.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.352
I'm telling you, it's great.
I opened up all the windows.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.432
The air is cold,
the tub is boiling hot.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.318
It's like Sweden, man.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.994
Sweden.

08:56.840 --> 09:00.310
Oh, yeah.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.273
Till this bastard over here says;

09:08.440 --> 09:11.034
"Let's call the sons of bitches,
go visit them in New York."

09:12.880 --> 09:14.996
Well, we're certainly glad
that you could make it.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.116
I like your organization, George.

09:17.280 --> 09:20.716
We've been talking to a friendly
son of bitch in the front office.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.236
-Wilhelm, I think his name is.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, Mr. Wilhelm.

09:24.400 --> 09:28.791
He told us George Costanza's gonna
be taking us bastards out on the town.

09:28.960 --> 09:32.873
We said, "That son of a bitch doesn't
know what he's got in store for him."

09:33.040 --> 09:35.190
-Finish your drink?
-Oh, yeah, almost. Almost.

09:35.360 --> 09:38.397
Let's get that bastard
to bring us another round, huh?

09:39.440 --> 09:40.873
You a big drinker, George?

09:41.440 --> 09:43.635
Well, maybe not
as much as this bastard.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.319
I can hold my own.

10:12.360 --> 10:15.636
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here
because I am concerned.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.839
Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps
the biggest race of your entire career...

10:20.000 --> 10:23.834
...and the person with whom
you have chosen to stay is....

10:24.000 --> 10:27.788
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying, get the hell out of there!

10:28.000 --> 10:30.309
Let me put you in a hotel.
You'll be comfortable.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.711
You'll be near the starting line,
and most importantly...

10:33.880 --> 10:36.314
...you'll have a wake-up call,
Jean-Paul.

10:36.480 --> 10:39.199
-A wake-up call.
-Wake-up call?

10:39.360 --> 10:40.429
These people never fail.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.558
They sit in a room
with a big clock all night long...

10:43.720 --> 10:45.915
...just waiting to make that call.

10:46.760 --> 10:49.433
No, I will stay with Elaine,
it would be rude.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.511
Hey, you bastards.

10:53.760 --> 10:54.909
Hey, so how was the meeting?

10:55.080 --> 10:57.310
I really like those sons of bitches.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.391
-Sons of bitches?
-Yeah. That's how they talk.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.835
You know, everyone's a bastard
or a son of a bitch.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.117
Yeah, it's like, "Boy, that son of a bitch
Boggs can really hit."

11:05.280 --> 11:06.395
-Really?
-Yeah.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.835
That's how they talk
in the major league.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.398
Oh, boy.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.629
Hey.

11:13.760 --> 11:17.833
-How many sweaters you got on?
-Four.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.037
Could I have a cup of tea,
boiling hot?

11:21.400 --> 11:22.992
What's going on?

11:23.160 --> 11:26.311
I fell asleep in the hot tub,
and the heat pump broke.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.119
Water went down to 58 degrees.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.078
I can't get
my core temperature back up.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.675
Your core temperature?

11:34.040 --> 11:36.600
Here, feel my hand.
Yeah, feel.

11:36.760 --> 11:39.513
This son of a bitch is ice cold.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.989
-Hello?
-ls that you, George?

11:44.160 --> 11:45.718
Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?

11:45.880 --> 11:49.270
Well, listen, you son of a bitch,
you know where we are?

11:49.440 --> 11:52.512
Thirty thousand feet
above your head, you bastard.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.711
What are they doing
letting you on an airplane?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.836
Don't they know
that's against FAA regulation?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.558
Hush up now. I can't hear.

11:58.720 --> 12:01.757
Listen, I want you to send those
agreements the minute you land.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.797
Our boys can't wait
to kick your butts.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.552
When's that bastard
coming to Houston?

12:05.720 --> 12:08.473
Zeke wants to know when you
bastards are coming to Houston?

12:08.640 --> 12:12.428
Hey, you tell that son of a bitch
no Yankee is ever coming to Houston.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.750
Not as long as you bastards
are running things.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.195
Speak up, George, I can't hear you.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.476
You tell that son of a bitch...

12:19.640 --> 12:22.154
...no Yankee
is ever coming to Houston.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.754
Not as long as you bastards
are running things.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.195
-George! Get ahold of yourself.
-Mr. Wilhelm.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.430
What's the matter with you?

12:32.960 --> 12:37.431
It was a cold winter's night
in Timbuktu.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.590
This stinks.

12:41.640 --> 12:45.235
Come on. Come on.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.233
-Hello.
-Hello.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.709
-I'm a friend of Elaine's.
-Oh, hi.

12:54.880 --> 12:59.237
Oh, look at that cute little bastard.

12:59.400 --> 13:03.188
You are mommy's little bastard,
aren't you?

13:04.920 --> 13:06.717
What are you doing
harassing my tenants?

13:06.880 --> 13:10.555
Oh, come on, you son of a bitch,
I'm just trying to be friendly.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.353
All right, that's it. Let's go.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.953
Man, I got a race tomorrow.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.073
-It's like a furnace in here.
-What the hell is going on?

13:21.240 --> 13:22.229
I turned up the heat.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.072
Turn up the heat
in your own apartment.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.753
I'm freezing.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.512
I just need
to get my hot tub running.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.917
I'm waiting for my new heat pump.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.116
Well, what's in this giant box
out in the hall?

13:33.120 --> 13:34.951
-Oh, that must be it.
-It's huge.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.635
Yeah, I got the biggest one they had.
Yeah, it's industrial strength.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.598
Sixteen thousand Btu's.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.679
Hello.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.354
Yeah, I can be there
in 10 minutes.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.989
You can count on me.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.993
-What?
-I got the call.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.151
-Jean-Paul?
-Jean-Paul.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.231
Very lucky to find this hotel,
Jean-Paul.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.072
Man, I just want to get some sleep.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.678
All right.
Let's check out the clock.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.478
Notch good.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.676
6;50.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.116
Volume check.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.792
What kind of music
you wanna wake up to?

14:20.960 --> 14:23.110
-Top 40, Classical?
-Man, whatever.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.919
-How about adult contemporary?
-Fine, adult contemporary.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.435
-Just pick one.
-All right.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.149
We're going with adult contempo.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.632
Now the fail-safe.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.554
The wake-up guy.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.870
Yes, yes, the wake-up guy.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.917
-Front desk.
-Yes, this is room 419.

14:43.080 --> 14:46.152
I'd like a wake-up call
for 6;50 a.m. tomorrow morning.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.548
Yes, sir.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.030
That's room 419, 6;50 a.m.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.668
Four-one-niner.

14:54.280 --> 14:57.078
Yes, I got it, sir.
You only had to say it once.

14:57.240 --> 15:00.516
But it's a very important wake-up call,
and I don't wanna take any chances.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.398
Every wake-up call I make
is important.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.596
You're no more important
than any of our guests.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.228
Well, I don't want to get into
a thing with you here, but--

15:07.400 --> 15:11.075
-Are you through?
-Yeah, I am, but I just--

15:16.760 --> 15:18.796
What is it?

15:19.120 --> 15:21.350
I think I offended the wake-up guy.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.956
-No, no.
-No, no, I did.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.839
-I think he's got it in for me.
-He doesn't have it in for you.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.389
-What if he doesn't call out of spite?
-lt is his job.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.878
I'm not comfortable.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.276
For God's sake.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.117
Jean-Paul?

15:45.920 --> 15:47.876
Hey, Jean-Paul?

15:49.760 --> 15:51.512
Jean-Paul?

15:53.240 --> 15:54.878
Jean-Paul?

15:55.040 --> 15:56.996
Oh, man.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.517
-Oh, machine.
-I'm not here. Leave a message.

16:03.680 --> 16:08.037
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul is missing.
He's alone in the city. Call me back.

16:13.920 --> 16:17.117
-Judy, hi, listen--
-You have got some nerve, Elaine.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.748
I told you about that baby
in confidence.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.754
Oh, I didn't tell anyone.

16:22.680 --> 16:26.116
Well, your friend certainly seemed
to know all about it.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.712
Jerry!

16:33.240 --> 16:35.390
I feel much better here
at my home base, Jean-Paul.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.959
It's a controlled environment.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.997
It's a marathon, you know?
Twenty-six miles.

16:39.160 --> 16:40.309
I need to get some sleep.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.358
Hey, believe me, if I had been
with you there in Barcelona...

16:43.520 --> 16:46.557
...you'd be polishing that medal
right now.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.668
I left a comfortable hotel bed for this.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.990
That wake-up guy was trouble.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.431
All right, I'll be right back.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.268
Man, that thing is noisy.

17:05.440 --> 17:09.273
We're cranking along pretty good.
We're almost up to 80 degrees.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.796
Listen, do me a favour, set your mental
alarm for 6;30 and give me a call.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.518
Okay.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.314
Done.

17:19.839 --> 17:23.388
He's put his faith in you.
He's put his faith in you.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.596
I trust Elaine, she is my friend.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.671
I trust Elaine, she is my friend.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.077
Frankly, I'm a little concerned.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.917
I'm exhausted.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.753
I've been on this street
1000 times.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.150
It's never looked so strange.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.595
The faces, so cold.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.388
In the distance, a child is crying.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.879
Fatherless.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.429
A bastard child, perhaps.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.836
My back aches.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.560
My heart aches, but my feet....

17:56.400 --> 17:59.710
My feet are resilient.

18:00.160 --> 18:04.119
Thank God I took off my heels
and put on my...

18:04.280 --> 18:06.555
...Himalayan walking shoes!

18:43.360 --> 18:45.271
4;02?

18:47.360 --> 18:49.920
8;47? Jean-Paul!
Wake up, wake up!

18:50.360 --> 18:53.750
Jean-Paul, the electricity went out!
Wake up, wake up, we've gotta go!

18:53.920 --> 18:56.150
-It's 8;47!
-8;47?

18:56.640 --> 18:59.677
Come on. Just put your clothes on.
You'll get dressed in the car.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.551
Idiot, I trusted you!

19:02.960 --> 19:05.030
Kramer, what happened?
The electricity went out.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.589
Yeah, the heat pump
blew all the fuses.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.757
What happened to your mental alarm?

19:10.400 --> 19:11.992
Well, I guess I hit the snooze.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.951
Make way. Watch out.
I've got a runner here.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.269
Get out of the way.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.996
Make way, make way.
Make way, he's a contender.

19:37.160 --> 19:40.072
-Hey, hold it.
-I'm late, man. I'm in the race.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.639
-Go ahead.
-Thank you, Jerry.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.836
You're a wonderful driver.
Fantastic route, man.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.991
All right, go.
It's a race. Come on.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.278
-You wanted to see me?
-Yes, George, come in, come in.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.795
Word has it you've been
cracking under the pressure.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.951
Can't cope, can't stand the heat.
Spit the bit.

19:56.360 --> 19:57.759
Mr. Steinbrenner, I can explain--

19:57.920 --> 20:00.115
We all get a little cuckoo.
I used to be like you.

20:00.280 --> 20:03.113
Berating personnel, calling managers
on the field during a game.

20:03.280 --> 20:05.840
Threatening to move the team
to New Jersey to upset people.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.194
Then I found a way to relax.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.112
I've got two words
to say to you, George.

20:09.280 --> 20:10.838
Hot tub.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.790
I'm telling you, I never told
anyone about that baby.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.473
I never even went near your building.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.598
-Then how did she find out, Jerry?
-You should check with the rabbi.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.993
-You want some hot tea?
-Oh, no, thank you.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.037
Oh, there's some runners.
Here they come.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.991
There's Jean-Paul.
He's out front.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.234
-He's leading! Go, Jean-Paul!
-Yeah!

20:34.400 --> 20:35.515
Come on!

20:39.680 --> 20:42.717
-One mile to go, Jean-Paul.
-Go, Jean-Paul!

21:08.600 --> 21:11.956
How are you enjoying it, George?
Melts that tension away, doesn't it?

21:12.120 --> 21:14.714
You gotta get that jet
on the good spot.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.189
Yes, that feels good.
Yes, that's real good.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.078
Yeah, that's where I keep
all my tension.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.514
Right under that chicken bone.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.513
I get my wife to stick her thumb
right in there like a screwdriver.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.238
The Phillips head, not the flat one.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.311
Oh, God, those flat ones
frustrate me.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.597
You got it in, but it slips out.
Put it in again, it slips out again.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.274
-You a single man, George?
-Well, I just recently--

21:33.440 --> 21:35.670
You wanna get something wild
going on in your life...

21:35.840 --> 21:37.512
...get a girl and
bring her in one of these.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.318
It's like four shots of Wild Turkey.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.198
She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.271
Terrible about that Mickey Mantle,
wasn't it?

21:43.440 --> 21:46.318
You know, we used to talk.
I don't think he liked me very much.
