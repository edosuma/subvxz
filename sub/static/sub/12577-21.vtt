[church bells ringing]

00:33.550 --> 00:36.136
so I told that state trooper:

00:36.136 --> 00:39.139
"ignorance of the lord
is no excuse either."

00:39.139 --> 00:40.473
??[church organ playing]

00:40.473 --> 00:41.641
well, that was quick.

00:41.641 --> 00:44.060
Yeah, well,the winston cup's
on at noon

00:44.060 --> 00:45.895
and rev. Thomasson
always wraps it up

00:45.895 --> 00:47.313
in plenty of time.

00:47.313 --> 00:49.816
And now, friends,
i'm sad to say

00:49.816 --> 00:53.653
that I've decided to retir
e from arlen first methodist
.

00:53.653 --> 00:55.989
[people muttering]

00:56.489 --> 00:59.075
retire? The man
works half a day a week.

00:59.075 --> 01:01.578
After much reflection
and soul-searching,

01:01.578 --> 01:02.579
I've decided

01:02.579 --> 01:05.615
that the future of god
is on the internet.

01:05.615 --> 01:08.118
Cyberrev.com will spread the gospel

01:08.118 --> 01:10.620
to every online soul
in the world

01:10.620 --> 01:12.622
unless you have a.o.l.

01:12.622 --> 01:15.625
I'll be hosting a potluck dinner
on saturday

01:15.625 --> 01:17.343
to welcome
your new minister...

01:17.710 --> 01:19.212
The new guy
had better like sports.

01:19.212 --> 01:21.297
Rev. Karen stroup.

01:21.598 --> 01:23.099
[all gasping]

01:23.099 --> 01:24.551
a woman.

01:26.636 --> 01:27.937
So, it's up
and running.

01:28.354 --> 01:29.856
The secret lab
in the basement

01:29.856 --> 01:31.357
of the harvard
divinity school

01:31.858 --> 01:34.644
where they ordain
women surgically.

01:35.145 --> 01:38.364
The pebble beach celebrity golf pro-am
is this sunday.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.366
If this gal's
sermon runs late,

01:40.366 --> 01:42.152
you know how women
like to talk,

01:42.452 --> 01:44.454
we're gonna miss
matt lauer's opening drive.

01:44.904 --> 01:46.906
You know what I think?
I think god sent

01:46.906 --> 01:49.409
a female minister
here to punish me.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.411
First single gal
to move to arlen in years,

01:51.411 --> 01:53.713
and she's forbidden to marry.

01:53.713 --> 01:55.632
Uh, bill,
ministers can marry.

01:55.632 --> 01:56.633
oh!

01:57.133 --> 01:58.134
[chuckling]

01:58.134 --> 01:59.302
thank you, god.

01:59.302 --> 02:03.306
Wait till cotton finds out
about this female man of god.

02:03.306 --> 02:05.809
I almost hesitate
to fax it to him.

02:05.809 --> 02:08.311
.
That's not
gonna happen, dale

02:08.311 --> 02:11.815
I told you to stop
sending my dad the gribble report

02:11.815 --> 02:14.317
you tell me
a lot of things, hank,

02:14.317 --> 02:15.819
most of which
I publish.

02:19.355 --> 02:21.691
Now, bobby, honey,
let's try to make

02:21.691 --> 02:24.194
rev. Stroup feel
very welcome, ok?

02:24.194 --> 02:26.196
Some people,
they just cannot accept

02:26.196 --> 02:28.698
women in positions
of real authority.

02:28.698 --> 02:30.200
I remember my first day

02:30.200 --> 02:31.701
as a 4th-grade
substitute teacher.

02:31.701 --> 02:32.952

02:45.098 --> 02:46.466
I am peggy hill,

02:46.466 --> 02:48.935
and this is peggy hill's
frito pie.

02:48.935 --> 02:50.937
It is a traditional
texas recipe

02:50.937 --> 02:53.273
that I found
on a bag of fritos.

02:53.273 --> 02:55.608
Well, peggy hill.

02:56.109 --> 02:59.145
Peggy hill,peggy hill, peggy hill
, good.

02:59.145 --> 03:01.648
You are in
for a real treat.

03:01.648 --> 03:05.652
I've prepared a little taste of minnesot
a called lutefisk.

03:05.652 --> 03:08.538
It's a scandinavia
n delicacy

03:08.538 --> 03:10.540
made by baking codfish
in a solution of lye

03:11.040 --> 03:13.209
until the bones
become gelatinous.

03:31.227 --> 03:32.228
heh,
You nervous?

03:32.228 --> 03:33.763
Yeah, a little.

03:33.763 --> 03:37.100
Me, too. You see,the pebble beach
pro-am is on at 1:30,

03:37.100 --> 03:39.519
and my v.c.r.
Doesn't always work.

03:39.936 --> 03:41.771
Oh, that could be
a problem.

03:42.655 --> 03:45.108
The quarterback challenge
is on at 1:15.

03:45.108 --> 03:46.826
Don't wanna Miss that.

03:46.826 --> 03:48.161
You're a football fan?

03:48.161 --> 03:51.164
Let's just say between god
and the vikings,

03:51.164 --> 03:53.666
sunday's not my day
of rest.

03:53.666 --> 03:54.667

all right.

this stuff stinks.

04:15.605 --> 04:17.106
[grunting]

04:17.890 --> 04:18.774
when I found out

04:19.274 --> 04:20.777
i'd been assigned
to a church in texas,

04:21.277 --> 04:22.278
I was a little worried.

04:22.779 --> 04:24.280
A lot of female ministers

04:24.280 --> 04:25.782
don't last too long
down here.

04:25.782 --> 04:28.284
Yeah, it gets pretty hot
in the summer.

04:29.285 --> 04:31.788
Hank, let me
ask you something.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.457
Do you like fish?

04:34.457 --> 04:37.543
Only catching 'em,gutting 'em,
and eating 'em.

04:38.411 --> 04:39.912
(rev. Stroup)
just a taste, hank.

04:40.413 --> 04:43.416
I want everyone in the congregation
to have some lutefisk

04:43.416 --> 04:45.418
and I only made
enough for 30.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.254
My lutefisk!
Where--where's my lutefisk?

04:48.254 --> 04:52.225
I put it right here between the frito pie
and the frito pie.

04:52.225 --> 04:53.926
Has anyone seen it?

04:55.928 --> 04:57.930
(dale)
maybe you put it
on the dessert table

04:57.930 --> 04:59.732
next to my lemon bars.

05:02.185 --> 05:03.770
(rev. Stroup)
well, it's not here.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.271
Can everyone
help me look?

05:05.271 --> 05:06.773
(bill)
I found it!

05:09.409 --> 05:11.744
Did anyone get
to try some?

05:16.699 --> 05:18.701
Someone just threw it out?

05:18.701 --> 05:21.204
That's right.I found it
in the trash.

05:24.707 --> 05:27.210
Oh, poor rev. Stroup, huh?

05:27.210 --> 05:29.212
Just seeing
how much people enjoyed
my frito pie

05:29.712 --> 05:32.215
must have, well,must have been salt
in her wounds.

05:32.215 --> 05:34.717
It's sort of an odd way
to attack a gal,

05:34.717 --> 05:36.219
to throw out
her favorite fish.

05:36.219 --> 05:37.220
Mmm-hmm.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.222
But I doubt that
there is anything

05:39.722 --> 05:41.724
that could have
hurt that woman more.

decent people.

I'm not going to judge
the whole town

of one lost soul.

don't know who it is.

d someone to hug.

they literally burned the very wood
the church was made of.

this hate crime

i'll do it.

20:35.367 --> 20:37.619
well,that was me, too.

20:37.619 --> 20:40.706
I'm old,I gots no shins,

20:40.706 --> 20:43.125
my plumbing don't work so good
no more.

20:43.125 --> 20:45.127
I blamed the fire
on someone else

20:45.627 --> 20:49.381
because I was embarrassed
by my own terrible smell.

20:49.381 --> 20:51.883
[all murmuring]

20:52.384 --> 20:57.222
t-the digestive problems
of the elderly are their cross to bear,

20:57.222 --> 21:00.559
and we should pity them,
not condemn them.

21:00.559 --> 21:01.977
oh.

21:01.977 --> 21:05.480
Cotton hill,
you have my forgiveness and my love.

21:05.480 --> 21:08.483
And I invite
the entire congregation

21:08.483 --> 21:11.987
to offer you their forgiveness
and love

21:11.987 --> 21:13.238
with a hug.

21:14.072 --> 21:15.040
[groans]

21:17.376 --> 21:18.543
I forgive you.

21:26.551 --> 21:28.053
[dale yelling]

21:28.053 --> 21:29.054
[groans]

21:29.054 --> 21:32.557
mom, as long as
we're confessing,

21:32.557 --> 21:35.560
remember when grandpa
broke the arm of your boggle trophy

21:35.560 --> 21:38.563
'cause he was playing
soccer in the house?

21:38.563 --> 21:41.066
I will never forgive
him for that.

21:41.066 --> 21:42.067
It was me.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.068
I forgive you.

21:43.852 --> 21:45.654
??[organ playing]

22:27.029 --> 22:28.480
(cotton)
but not in the face.

22:28.480 --> 22:29.781
That's how I make
my livings.
