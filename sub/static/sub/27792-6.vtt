WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.537
<i>Previously on</i>
The Magicians...

00:02.628 --> 00:05.996
So this book is used to help
me locate different worlds

00:06.089 --> 00:07.296
via a cooperative spell?

00:07.382 --> 00:08.839
Well, it is called
<i>The World Book.</i>

00:08.926 --> 00:11.919
Okay, there's a spell in here that will
tell me where I'm supposed to go,

00:12.012 --> 00:14.470
and I will stay there for good, okay?
Just let me help you.

00:14.556 --> 00:17.048
This is just casual, right?
We're not...

00:17.142 --> 00:20.852
I saved your life, bitch.
Casual that.

00:20.938 --> 00:22.725
A talking lizard
of the Dunes.

00:22.814 --> 00:26.023
Well, what's my birthright,
you scaly shit?

00:26.109 --> 00:29.102
It's the talking animals.
They've all been struck dumb.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.404
All those organs,
they're building blocks,

00:31.490 --> 00:33.482
trying to piece together
a body.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.907
Is it yours?

00:36.495 --> 00:39.078
Eliot's alive. He's alive.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.952
- So you're Team Monster now?
- I'm Team Eliot.

00:42.042 --> 00:46.503
Your Penny's dead or not alive
in some confusing way.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.750
- You're Kady?
- What's going on?

00:48.840 --> 00:50.422
I'm not your Penny.

00:50.509 --> 00:51.750
Marina.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.835
I've been looking for you.

00:53.929 --> 00:55.761
- Penny, right?
- I know you?

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

01:13.073 --> 01:14.280
Ahh!

01:14.741 --> 01:17.028
Well, it's about time
you woke up.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.322
The hell?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.029
I assume you remember
getting jumped.

01:21.123 --> 01:26.790
Well, what happened next is you were sold
for 500 bucks and an Alpha Black Lotus...

01:26.878 --> 01:28.961
Mint condish.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.709
It's <i>Magic: The Gathering?</i>

01:31.466 --> 01:33.626
Are you telling me that <i>Magic</i> cards
are actually magic?

01:34.136 --> 01:36.879
No, just really expensive.

01:40.309 --> 01:41.550
Excuse me.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.062
Okay, you know this kid?

01:46.148 --> 01:48.936
Not personally.
He's kind of a legend, though.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.517
He's a horomancer.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.398
You know, time magic,
fourth dimension shit.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.274
Yeah, cool story.
Why am I in a cage?

01:54.823 --> 01:56.985
Hey, Stoppard.

01:57.075 --> 02:00.739
What is it you want, huh?
You want a spell? Deweys?

02:00.829 --> 02:03.697
- Lose your virginity?
- You're not really my type.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.827
Oh. Well, if he is,
you can totally have him.

02:05.917 --> 02:10.332
That's... No, I don't
want sex or to hurt you.

02:10.422 --> 02:11.833
I don't want any of that.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.165
I just want you guys
to go back to your timeline,

02:14.259 --> 02:16.091
where you belong.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.930
Look, it's nothing personal.

02:21.016 --> 02:24.305
Mmm. People in cages
is never not personal, sweetie.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.933
You guys are creating
a frequency dissonance.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.815
It's your quarks, subtle.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.546
Most people wouldn't notice,
but what I do...

02:33.570 --> 02:34.777
What are you doing?

02:34.863 --> 02:36.775
You guys are
fucking up every spell.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.948
Here's an idea,
adjust to our quarks.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.741
They're subatomic.
How hard can it be?

02:40.827 --> 02:43.365
Yeah, I tried that.
Didn't work.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.117
So...

02:45.207 --> 02:47.039
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.536
No, no, no.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.913
- Welcome home, guys.
- Father fuck me.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.590
That's weird.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.093
It was just working
a minute ago.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.286
Yeah, it's 'cause there was
magic in that timeline.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.142
There ain't in timeline 23.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.312
You gonna let me out?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.738
Why would I?
You're a psychopath.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.823
One, rude.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.637
And, two, I know how to use that thing,
and you don't.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.618
You're also
a compulsive liar, so...

03:24.705 --> 03:26.742
Okay, well, you're
going to send yourself

03:26.832 --> 03:30.576
to some cracked-out in-between space,
but whatever.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.596
Don't screw this up.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.435
Calm your man tits.
I got this.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.606
Okay...

04:02.534 --> 04:04.494
I thought you said
you knew how to use this thing.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.578
Well, you should learn

04:05.662 --> 04:07.102
to trust your instincts
about people.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.517
Just relax, there's enough juice
in the Dewey for one more jump.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.461
Let's just not use it
until we know how to, okay?

04:11.543 --> 04:13.330
Sure, sure, cool, cool.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.539
The vibe I'm getting
from this timeline is very <i>1984.</i>

04:19.216 --> 04:23.302
Worse. It's <i>The Crucible.</i>

04:34.733 --> 04:36.144
I don't know, Q.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.977
If we help him collect
his stone organ prizes,

04:39.070 --> 04:41.232
we can get him out of Eliot.
It's a good plan.

04:41.323 --> 04:43.030
Unless we help him build

04:43.116 --> 04:45.403
a completely indestructible
titan god body.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.453
Well, he's already pretty murder-y.
It can't get much worse.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.281
You say that like we
can just risk people's lives.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.956
We've taken down gods before.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.126
And we end up
losing every time.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.212
It's Eliot.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.204
Right now we can't

04:58.298 --> 05:02.008
fix everything, but
I think that we can do this.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.710
Okay, for now, we help The Monster,
but at the same time,

05:04.805 --> 05:07.138
we also figure out
what our next move's going to be.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.549
Thank you.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.893
I don't know.
I guess I'm just worried.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.916
- I can't help you if you...
- You're helping a lot.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.681
I was a goddess,
and now I'm just

05:16.775 --> 05:19.108
your friendly neighborhood
bulletproof vest.

05:19.194 --> 05:22.028
I mean, you would be
a very high level X-Man.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.113
Mmm?

05:23.198 --> 05:24.564
Like Emma Frost's
diamond form.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.024
- Mutant.
- A mutant.

05:26.117 --> 05:29.110
Like The Indestructress.

05:30.121 --> 05:32.829
The page you gave The Monster,
you remember what it says?

05:32.916 --> 05:34.498
We didn't have time
to decipher it all.

05:34.584 --> 05:35.978
I mean, there were
a lot of hieroglyphs.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.710
Okay, do you remember
what hieroglyphs?

05:38.797 --> 05:40.880
So I'm thinking,
like, so...

05:40.966 --> 05:45.836
We've got two stone things
covered in hieroglyphs,

05:45.929 --> 05:48.091
neither of which came
from an Egyptian god, so...

05:48.181 --> 05:50.298
- Who did the writing?
- And why?

05:50.392 --> 05:51.392
Um...

05:51.601 --> 05:54.719
There were a lot
of these ones.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.305
- What is that?
- A lot.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.935
A yellow fruit?

05:59.609 --> 06:02.397
- Is there a yellow fruit god?
- I don't know.

06:02.487 --> 06:05.821
I don't remember anything
from any class at Brakebills.

06:05.907 --> 06:08.900
Ooh! "Recently uncovered
tomb changes much

06:08.994 --> 06:11.828
"of what archeologists thought they knew
about ancient Egypt."

06:11.913 --> 06:14.701
Maybe stuff Brakebills
didn't know about.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.248
Worth a shot.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.719
Why Modesto, Alice?

06:28.805 --> 06:30.592
Still trying
to figure that out.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.423
My life, that is.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.724
Oh.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.345
I like your bunnies.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.187
They were my mom's.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.857
Well, she had lovely taste
in glass animals.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.607
No drugs, no booze,
no bullshit.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.484
You want to smoke,
you do it outside,

06:47.574 --> 06:49.406
and the rent is due
on the 5th.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.992
- I understand.
- Okay.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.324
I'll show you
to your room.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.533
Oh. Um, just
one more question...

06:58.627 --> 07:01.461
What is there to do
in, uh, Modesto?

07:03.715 --> 07:05.377
Shit-all, really.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.762
So then why is it here
if it's native to Loria?

07:11.848 --> 07:14.682
We're unsure, but since
the return of magic,

07:14.768 --> 07:17.886
the Atros flower has been found blooming
all over Fillory.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.562
Its pollen is why
the talking animals can't speak.

07:20.649 --> 07:23.483
Allergies are why
my birthright lizard ain't saying shit?

07:23.568 --> 07:25.480
Wait, if the bunnies
can't talk,

07:25.570 --> 07:28.278
that means that we're cut of
from everyone else back on Earth.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.593
How am I going to remind them
to water my rosemary plants?

07:30.617 --> 07:32.950
Or ask 23 to blip
our asses back.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.153
- That, too.
- There is good news.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.122
- We found a remedy.
- The juice from a beet

07:38.208 --> 07:40.325
that grows on one of
the smaller fingerling isles,

07:40.418 --> 07:41.875
Codswall.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.750
Best known for their
inordinately polite alpacas.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.669
- Alpacas can be supreme dicks.
- Great.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.921
Get a ship to Cockswallow.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.927
- Codswall.
- Codswall.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.339
Juice the beets,
distribute, done.

07:55.433 --> 07:59.097
There's one small,
minute, trivial,

07:59.187 --> 08:02.225
infinitesimally minuscule,
itty-bitty problem.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.105
Lady Pike, who rules Codswall,
has been known to be, uh...

08:08.363 --> 08:09.524
Difficult.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.571
Are you saying she's a bitch?

08:13.284 --> 08:15.367
Good thing I'm not
one at all, then.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.324
Stop laughing.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.205
That it?

08:28.425 --> 08:30.212
Do you have any suggestions
on things to do

08:30.301 --> 08:31.633
in or around Modesto?

08:32.136 --> 08:33.503
Don't die of boredom?

08:36.683 --> 08:38.094
I like your tattoos.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.599
Mmm-hmm.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.611
Hard getting by with
all those shortages, huh?

08:43.898 --> 08:46.060
Yeah, maybe for
the classically trained.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.564
Cockroaches like me,
we do what we got to.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.404
Always have.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.108
- Get over there!
- I didn't do anything.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.014
They're just tattoos.
They don't mean anything.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.154
Keep moving.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.079
They are not
fucking around here.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.953
Yeah, honestly,
I'm more concerned

09:03.043 --> 09:05.104
about what my girlfriend
will do if I don't make it back

09:05.128 --> 09:06.539
in time for her birthday.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.086
You have a girlfriend?

09:08.173 --> 09:09.584
As in a human
you give a shit about?

09:09.674 --> 09:12.667
Yeah, and I'd rather not
lose her this time.

09:12.761 --> 09:16.004
We were a thing back in timeline 23,
and I fucked it up.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.965
You're telling me that you found
another one of her in timeline 40?

09:19.059 --> 09:20.059
Yes.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.787
And now that I know what she will
and won't put up with,

09:21.811 --> 09:23.552
it's going so much
better this time.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.263
- That's sociopathic.
- Dude, we're refugees.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.294
We deserve any and all
advantages that come our way.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.059
Yeah, like penthouse
apartments?

09:30.153 --> 09:32.611
'Cause I don't know
any refugees that live like that.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.551
You want that thing? You can have it.
It's way more trouble than it's worth.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.783
Hey, crazy pitch...

09:37.869 --> 09:41.112
What if we asked
Stoppard for help here?

09:41.206 --> 09:43.198
Like the Stoppard
in this timeline?

09:43.291 --> 09:44.748
Probably got burned
at the stake.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.746
Okay, but if he didn't,
he has no beef with us.

09:46.836 --> 09:50.125
We take the thing to him.
If anyone can fix it, he can.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.081
There's so much terrible
about that idea.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.211
Okay, do you know

09:53.301 --> 09:54.883
another horomancer? No?

09:55.762 --> 09:57.674
Then let's go.

10:11.027 --> 10:14.737
<i>Brothers and sisters,
when things are lost,</i>

10:15.281 --> 10:17.773
<i>they want to be found.</i>

10:17.867 --> 10:20.280
<i>Ms. Ross' engagement ring,</i>

10:20.370 --> 10:23.488
<i>little Joey Mireles' dog...</i>

10:25.083 --> 10:26.790
<i>That we will find the money</i>

10:26.876 --> 10:29.664
<i>to pay for Kiersten Bron's
leukemia treatment.</i>

10:29.754 --> 10:32.417
- Tea?
- Uh, no, thank you.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.133
Um, do you know
Reverend Ted Grayson?

10:36.219 --> 10:38.051
Yeah, he's my minister.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.923
He's a little theatrical at
times, but he's a good man.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.016
Why, are you religious?

10:43.101 --> 10:45.969
Not really. You?

10:46.062 --> 10:47.519
No.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.187
My mom was.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.732
I was on probation
when she passed,

10:51.818 --> 10:56.358
and the congregation
was there for me, so I still go.

11:39.782 --> 11:40.782
Ah.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.677
Look, I'm not good at
the whole back-and-forth thing,

12:23.701 --> 12:24.862
so I'm just going to say it.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.195
I saw you. I saw you
find the lock box.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.654
You followed me?

12:28.748 --> 12:29.989
How did you know where to dig?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.166
No idea what
you're talking about.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.291
How the hell
did you just do that?

12:40.885 --> 12:42.421
Same way you found the box.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.718
I'm a magician. Like you.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.888
You had no idea,
did you?

12:50.979 --> 12:53.016
That it was real
till you could do it.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.273
You can talk to me.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.772
To me, this doesn't even
count as weird.

13:01.698 --> 13:04.441
It just started a couple
of months ago.

13:05.159 --> 13:11.827
I lost my keys, and then all of a sudden,
I could just feel it in my head.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.623
You're a quaeromancer.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.243
It's really rare, actually.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.999
I've never met one,

13:18.089 --> 13:19.955
and I went to a school
full of people like us.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.633
- Are you shitting me?
- Nope.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.628
They can do
all kinds of things.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.658
Most people don't figure out
their thing until their 20s,

13:27.682 --> 13:30.675
but every now and then, somebody...
It takes them longer.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.009
Have you told anyone?

13:32.145 --> 13:35.104
They would
think I was nuts.

13:36.274 --> 13:37.731
Honestly,

13:39.402 --> 13:42.110
it's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.732
Do you know what I mean?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.780
Well,

13:45.867 --> 13:47.824
yes and no.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.488
Sheila, I think you
might be why I'm here.

13:55.126 --> 13:58.369
- Librarians.
- Librarians?

13:58.463 --> 14:01.171
They can't know I'm here.
Please don't tell them.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.673
Thanks, but I'm
not interested.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.635
Sheila Cozener?
I'm Paul, this is Laurel,

14:10.725 --> 14:13.183
and we'd like to talk to you
about an opportunity.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.306
One involving
your newfound talents.

14:21.402 --> 14:24.520
Sheila, I am telling you,
you can't trust the Library.

14:24.614 --> 14:26.759
Okay, I know that they told you
they'd give you more magic

14:26.783 --> 14:29.571
if you signed up for a Library card,
but they won't, okay?

14:29.660 --> 14:32.020
The Library card is just a way
for them to keep tabs on you.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.696
Alice, I get it.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.077
You know, whatever run-in
you had with them

14:36.167 --> 14:37.703
clearly traumatized you.

14:37.794 --> 14:41.128
I don't know enough about any of
this to be signing up for anything.

14:41.214 --> 14:45.379
You said that you were
in Modesto because of me.

14:45.468 --> 14:46.879
Right?

14:47.512 --> 14:50.300
What if it's because you're supposed
to teach me everything?

14:50.390 --> 14:53.258
No. Knowing more isn't better.

14:53.351 --> 14:54.933
How could it not?

14:55.019 --> 14:58.183
Because it's powerful
and it can be really, really bad.

14:58.272 --> 15:02.312
Okay, look, I'm a grown woman,
you're a grown woman, we make choices.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.268
Is there something
I'm missing here?

15:04.362 --> 15:05.648
Okay, listen,

15:06.364 --> 15:09.323
I did a lot of stupid shit
when I was your age.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.650
Yeah, so did I,

15:10.743 --> 15:13.952
and magic made it
so much bigger and so much worse.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.779
And if you regret it,

15:15.873 --> 15:18.240
if you think about
those people that you hurt

15:18.334 --> 15:20.496
and all that time
that you wasted every single day,

15:20.586 --> 15:22.122
then I know how you feel.

15:22.213 --> 15:24.876
Look, I hear you.
I get it.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.299
But it's what we
make of it, right?

15:27.385 --> 15:29.377
And for me, it's...

15:31.180 --> 15:34.344
It's like the first time that I can,
you know, turn things around,

15:34.434 --> 15:37.097
maybe do something good.

15:38.271 --> 15:42.641
But I need you
to help me do that.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.269
Please!

15:47.071 --> 15:51.907
All right, we are going to
need to take this outside.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.451
If you own the house,
why do you smoke outside?

15:55.037 --> 15:57.495
I don't know, it's my
mother's rules, I guess.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.703
Always seemed kind of wrong
just breaking them

16:00.793 --> 16:02.625
'cause she was gone.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.956
Come on.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.297
Okay.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.262
Let's start with Popper 1.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.681
Okay.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.510
I'll make this simple.
We need your beets.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.186
At a fair price,
of course.

16:21.272 --> 16:23.104
I doubt the
island of Clitswell...

16:23.191 --> 16:25.854
- Codswall.
- Codswall.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.186
- Anyway, I...
- Do you even know where Codswall is?

16:29.280 --> 16:31.522
Of course.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.199
It's one of the bigger...

16:34.285 --> 16:36.447
Smaller fingering islands.

16:36.537 --> 16:39.200
- Fingerling.
- Exactly. Fingerling.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.657
Thank you, Your Majesty.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.993
- For?
- Confirming my suspicion

16:44.086 --> 16:46.248
that you've never had
consideration for us.

16:46.339 --> 16:50.834
This makes my decision to sell
our beets to West Loria that much easier.

16:51.886 --> 16:55.800
- Where the fuck is West Loria?
- West of Loria, Your Majesty.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.756
- But since when?
- While you were Janet,

16:57.850 --> 17:02.311
King Idri and his sister Ru,
had a squabble/slight war.

17:03.481 --> 17:06.064
- Like a civil war?
- And as acting High King,

17:06.150 --> 17:08.733
I asked myself, "What would
Margo or Eliot do?"

17:08.819 --> 17:12.233
- Support our ally, Idri.
- Unfortunately, he lost.

17:12.323 --> 17:16.317
Now Queen Ru rules
over West Loria.

17:16.410 --> 17:20.619
And 'cause she's pissed we helped Idri,
she wants all Lady Pike's fresh beets?

17:20.705 --> 17:22.492
Damn. That's cold.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.246
Verily, they don't even have
talking animals in West Loria.

17:25.336 --> 17:27.328
One problem at a time.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.038
- The Cumdumpsterson twat...
- Codswall.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.543
Oh, I know what I said.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.045
I'm going to firebomb
the shit

17:33.135 --> 17:35.252
out of her floating patch of dirt
and take her beets.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.087
Bada-bing, bada-fuck her.

17:37.181 --> 17:40.265
Could we be a tad
less incendiary?

17:40.351 --> 17:41.762
Agreed.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.515
What would Eliot do?

17:46.691 --> 17:48.899
Eliot's not here, sweetie.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.351
I am.

17:55.116 --> 17:58.575
So, just to ask this,

17:58.661 --> 18:01.995
can we really risk
war with West Loria?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.414
Diplomacy was
Eliot's thing, Josh.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.116
Diplomacy is what
got you elected.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.953
I got elected because
I listened to a drunk bear

18:09.046 --> 18:10.537
talk about his fee-fees.

18:10.631 --> 18:14.295
- That's all diplomacy is!
- It was an accident.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.504
I don't know how to intentionally care
about other people's shit.

18:18.681 --> 18:21.515
Lucky for you,
that's all I do.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.303
Fine.

18:26.397 --> 18:28.514
One shot, Hoberman.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.284
Hi, we're looking
for Stoppard.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.951
Daniel, honey.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.080
Come in before
someone sees you.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.037
Amazing.

18:52.131 --> 18:56.000
I haven't seen anything like this since
before the exclusion laws.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.169
I have one of these!

18:58.262 --> 19:00.174
And it's missing
a spoke like mine.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.971
What are the odds?

19:02.558 --> 19:04.595
Anyway, this one, it didn't
come with a manual.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.517
Do you have any ideas?

19:06.604 --> 19:08.391
Well, it's hard
to explain, but I think...

19:08.481 --> 19:10.017
Daniel, something's not...

19:10.775 --> 19:13.688
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

19:14.695 --> 19:16.561
Something's wrong
with the spells.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.989
Hold on,
I'll figure this out.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.441
Quickly, while he's busy.

19:27.416 --> 19:32.002
Found an outdated copy
of Taussig's <i>Primer</i> and a VCR manual.

19:32.088 --> 19:35.297
This place has shit
for helpful books.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.500
Well, at least it's standing.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.710
I cannot believe a bunch
of militant muggles

19:39.804 --> 19:41.841
beat me to burning down
Brakebills.

19:42.306 --> 19:45.219
- What's that?
- Oh. It was Sonia's.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.852
- You mean Stoppard's mother?
- I mean Sonia Kikuno,

19:48.938 --> 19:52.227
the genius who basically
pioneered horomancy.

19:52.316 --> 19:55.104
This is easily one of the most
accidentally valuable things

19:55.194 --> 19:56.310
I've ever stolen.

19:56.404 --> 19:57.485
Here, look.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.401
Wasn't that in
Stoppard's workshop?

20:00.491 --> 20:03.905
Yeah. That screen
opens a window in time.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.737
You can FaceTime
with the past as far back as 50 years.

20:06.831 --> 20:09.244
It's genuinely genius.
Like, wow.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.370
A lot of these spells
use cinnabar.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.076
Hasn't that stuff
been banned for years?

20:13.170 --> 20:16.584
Yeah, it causes severe
neuro-degeneration,

20:16.674 --> 20:18.757
which is probably
what's happening with Sonia.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.675
She's been
hitting the cinnabar

20:20.761 --> 20:23.094
pretty hard for decades,
I imagine.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.092
So,

20:25.182 --> 20:27.640
she has
clockwork Alzheimer's?

20:28.310 --> 20:31.348
Hmm, kind of,
but so much worse.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.305
Your brain gets
unstuck in time.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.159
You don't know
where you are or when you are,

20:35.234 --> 20:37.100
and you can't
control it.

20:37.194 --> 20:40.778
It is good, good times,
and then you die.

20:40.865 --> 20:43.482
Yeah, but it seemed like
they had a treatment.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.114
I mean, those weird watches
she had on?

20:46.454 --> 20:49.288
Mmm, yeah, until
they got messed up

20:49.373 --> 20:50.830
by us.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.954
Must be
what started all this.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.035
I mean,
back in timeline 40...

20:55.129 --> 20:57.337
It's why Stoppard
hunted us down.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.709
He's trying to save his mom.

20:58.799 --> 20:59.960
Oh.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.382
Now I almost
feel bad for him.

21:01.469 --> 21:02.630
No, feel bad for us.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.757
Even if we get back
to timeline 40,

21:04.847 --> 21:07.305
Stoppard is going to do
anything he can to kick us out.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.882
Unless we kill him.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.719
For trying to save his mom?

21:11.812 --> 21:14.350
Moms die every day.
Circle of life.

21:14.565 --> 21:17.524
Wow. No!

21:17.902 --> 21:20.610
We help him save her.

21:32.750 --> 21:36.164
Am I just absorbing
a fuck-ton of cinnabar right now?

21:36.504 --> 21:38.962
Yeah, and breathing it.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.832
Great.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.214
Let's finish this
and get the hell out of here.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.690
- Sonia?
<i>- Who are you?</i>

21:59.777 --> 22:01.860
Friends of Daniel,
who's grown now.

22:02.488 --> 22:03.979
Listen, we need
to talk to you

22:04.073 --> 22:05.675
about that cinnabar
that you're using. It's...

22:05.699 --> 22:08.442
<i>Frying my brain into
cheesecloth, I know.</i>

22:09.912 --> 22:12.325
<i>Daniel used my designs to build
the device you're using.</i>

22:13.290 --> 22:15.122
<i>We talked
a couple months ago.</i>

22:15.668 --> 22:18.627
<i>If you were his friends,
you'd know that.</i>

22:18.712 --> 22:20.499
He asked you to stop?

22:20.589 --> 22:22.125
<i>Of course.</i>

22:22.216 --> 22:24.549
<i>He also told me I'm about
to have a breakthrough</i>

22:24.635 --> 22:26.501
<i>that creates
a whole new discipline.</i>

22:26.595 --> 22:29.383
<i>I can't stop now.
My work's too important.</i>

22:29.473 --> 22:30.884
Fair point.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.307
So you're just going to pick

22:32.393 --> 22:34.180
your clock shit
over your own kid?

22:35.604 --> 22:38.688
<i>No, idiot. I choose both.</i>

22:38.774 --> 22:41.187
<i>I designed devices
to counter the cinnabar,</i>

22:41.277 --> 22:44.270
<i>tether my mind right here
with my work and my kid.</i>

22:45.614 --> 22:49.028
<i>As long as I have these working for me,
I'll be fine.</i>

22:49.618 --> 22:51.735
<i>I intend to die
a very old lady...</i>

22:51.829 --> 22:53.912
<i>Sharp as a tack.</i>

22:56.125 --> 22:58.583
Fuck her.
It's not our fault.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.981
She knew the consequences,
and she still licked her paintbrushes.

23:01.005 --> 23:03.247
We go back to 40,
we're taking the kid's mom away.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.985
- I'm not doing that.
- Well, I'm not losing

23:05.009 --> 23:06.921
my life because some horo-bitch
is a shitty mom.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.752
She's shitty
so he should suffer?

23:09.346 --> 23:11.554
We're the ones
who don't belong.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.178
You know what?
You do you.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.562
I'm going back to 40
and my future wife.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.514
Don't touch me!

23:27.239 --> 23:28.355
Shit.

23:35.164 --> 23:36.164
Okay.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.451
Quick.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.587
- Anything?
- Nothing yet.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.046
Keep looking.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.679
Quentin.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.724
Whoopsies.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.310
Are you drunk?

24:04.151 --> 24:06.859
This body hearts tequila

24:06.946 --> 24:08.482
when I'm happy,
when I'm sad,

24:08.572 --> 24:11.610
when I'm bored
because everything is taking too long,

24:11.700 --> 24:13.407
meaning you.

24:13.494 --> 24:14.951
Relevant story.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.244
I was in a road,

24:16.330 --> 24:20.700
and I almost got hit by,
what do you call it, a big fat truck.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.955
But I wouldn't have
felt anything at all

24:23.045 --> 24:24.832
because tequila
is my friend.

24:26.674 --> 24:29.007
Um, you know, great news,

24:29.093 --> 24:32.552
we've made good progress
finding that part of yours.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.299
Um...

24:34.390 --> 24:36.803
You wouldn't still happen
to have the paper I gave you?

24:37.059 --> 24:41.053
Oh... I misplaced it.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.513
Do you know anything about

24:43.607 --> 24:46.896
an Egyptian god
of yellow fruit?

24:47.861 --> 24:50.353
I'm not at all helpful
like this, am I?

24:50.447 --> 24:51.528
What do you think?

24:51.615 --> 24:56.360
You seem stressed by your vast
and obvious limitations.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.139
Why don't we just ask

24:58.163 --> 24:59.404
someone who was there?

25:14.013 --> 25:16.096
You know, for having
such desiccated hands,

25:16.181 --> 25:18.013
his Hieratic script's amazing.

25:21.562 --> 25:22.973
What did he say?

25:23.772 --> 25:27.641
Cut our poor mummy friend
some slack, Hoo-lia.

25:27.735 --> 25:29.146
He took a hook
to the brain.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.694
Of course, he's got a bit
of a speech impediment.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.817
Oh,
uh, the yellow fruit.

25:34.491 --> 25:38.201
It's a mandrake root,
and we are looking for Heka,

25:38.287 --> 25:40.449
the god of magic
and medicine.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.997
It looks like he's got
one of your stones.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.574
Let's go kill him.

25:44.668 --> 25:47.832
He's already dead.

25:49.131 --> 25:52.499
Looks like he was buried
in the Temple of...

25:52.593 --> 25:53.754
Uh...

25:53.844 --> 25:55.210
Esna?

25:56.388 --> 26:00.348
Uh, which was
looted shortly after.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.678
And where is it now?
My loot?

26:06.565 --> 26:08.727
Yes, this is
very disappointing.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.101
Figure this out
before I get mad.

26:12.196 --> 26:15.860
This body craves
a cinnamon churro.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.618
Um...

26:26.335 --> 26:27.826
Bye.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.971
- We can take a break.
- No, no, it's okay.

26:48.065 --> 26:49.397
I want to keep going.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.685
It bothers you, doesn't it?
That I'm so into this?

26:53.779 --> 26:55.645
It just worries me.

26:55.739 --> 26:59.323
For you, magic, you think
it just can fix everything,

26:59.409 --> 27:01.617
but it kind of has a way
of breaking things.

27:02.246 --> 27:04.206
Sometimes I feel like
everything that's gone wrong

27:04.248 --> 27:06.831
in my life is 'cause of it.

27:07.459 --> 27:12.796
Yeah, I used to say the same about alcohol,
about drugs, about money,

27:12.881 --> 27:14.998
but none of that's
really good or bad.

27:15.092 --> 27:17.960
It just is. It's how
you handle it, really.

27:18.137 --> 27:21.005
Don't drink that.
The tap's got lead in it.

27:21.098 --> 27:23.340
You got to drink the bottled water
out of the fridge.

27:23.433 --> 27:26.551
- Why is there lead in the tap?
- City's pipes.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.307
They're old and corroded.

27:28.939 --> 27:30.555
Why don't they
just fix it?

27:30.649 --> 27:32.811
That's cute,
that you think they would.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.985
Asekian's Purification.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.820
I can show you.
It's simple.

27:49.293 --> 27:52.457
Can you do that
for the rest of the water supply?

27:53.088 --> 27:56.001
No, or better yet, is there a spell
that would restore

27:56.091 --> 27:59.255
- all the old pipes in Modesto?
- There is, but...

27:59.344 --> 28:00.460
Okay, well, then do that.

28:00.554 --> 28:01.795
Do it, please,

28:01.889 --> 28:04.329
because you have no idea
how many people, how many kids are...

28:04.892 --> 28:06.599
No, it's too big.
We can't do it.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.223
There's not enough
ambient magic.

28:09.313 --> 28:11.851
The Library,
it doles out the rest?

28:14.902 --> 28:16.393
Wait.

28:16.486 --> 28:19.945
You said that
they control the levels

28:21.491 --> 28:24.734
of ambient magic that
flow through the pipes, right?

28:24.828 --> 28:26.035
Yeah?

28:26.622 --> 28:27.908
I can feel one.

28:28.540 --> 28:29.951
They're everywhere.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.499
No, no, no.

28:34.588 --> 28:36.329
I think this one's different.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.757
This one has a leak.

28:43.138 --> 28:45.596
This isn't just food, Margo.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.548
This is your secret weapon.

28:47.643 --> 28:50.351
You can tell a lot about people
based on what they eat.

28:52.105 --> 28:55.314
- Everything looks lovely.
- Thank you.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.017
- Our chef is very...
- Talented.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.602
Extra.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.483
I'll take that
as a compliment.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.611
Like I was saying,
is she reserved, adventurous?

29:04.701 --> 29:07.284
Maybe she's sexy and decadent

29:07.371 --> 29:10.455
like a truffle lobster
mac and cheese.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.953
Oh, interesting.

29:13.043 --> 29:16.502
Mongoose cream egg
with caviar. She's bold.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.752
Proud of her accomplishments,
but being so driven

29:19.841 --> 29:23.175
has led her to be
lonely, misunderstood.

29:23.262 --> 29:27.176
- Mmm.
- Tick said something about Codswall's polite alpacas.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.178
Maybe she's proud
of that. Ask.

29:29.768 --> 29:33.762
I hear Codswall
has upstanding alpacas.

29:34.523 --> 29:38.107
It is a misconception
that alpacas have behavioral issues.

29:38.193 --> 29:42.278
The truth is, they have a lack of
self-esteem from years of shearing.

29:42.364 --> 29:45.482
Imagine being stripped naked twice,
even three times a year.

29:46.076 --> 29:48.443
There it is.
She's real into her 'pacas.

29:48.996 --> 29:52.239
- Empathize with her.
- The indignity is real.

29:52.749 --> 29:56.083
Like humans,
alpacas need affection

29:56.169 --> 29:58.161
- and love.
- Preach.

29:58.505 --> 29:59.746
You may not know this,

29:59.840 --> 30:02.833
but I ran on a platform
of animal equality.

30:02.926 --> 30:04.667
My administration
is the first

30:04.761 --> 30:07.344
to give talking animals
their rightful voice.

30:08.223 --> 30:11.011
I mean, that is why
we're here tonight, right?

30:11.101 --> 30:12.763
The animals.

30:12.853 --> 30:16.312
I just care so damn much.

30:16.982 --> 30:22.102
I like to drink my tea
with a splash of alpaca milk.

30:27.784 --> 30:28.991
Would you like some?

30:29.077 --> 30:31.569
Uh, you can't
refuse this, Margo.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.451
It's straight from
my dearest Delilah's teat.

30:41.715 --> 30:42.715
Uh-huh.

30:47.304 --> 30:48.966
Do it, Margo.

30:52.142 --> 30:53.633
Now!

30:55.312 --> 30:56.723
Yeah, good.

30:58.148 --> 31:01.232
You are a champion.

31:01.318 --> 31:03.526
You can really
taste the love.

31:04.654 --> 31:07.613
What a beautiful way
to say it.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.901
I'm afraid I may have judged
Your Majesty too quickly.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.736
Same.

31:13.830 --> 31:17.574
Which is why I would love it
if we could start fresh.

31:17.667 --> 31:18.703
Your beets...

31:18.794 --> 31:20.626
Unfortunately, I have
already agreed

31:20.712 --> 31:22.419
to sell my beets
to West Loria,

31:22.506 --> 31:24.623
and being a woman of my word,

31:24.716 --> 31:26.207
I can't go back.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.297
You understand, right?

31:30.263 --> 31:33.006
I'm going to
check on dessert.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.762
I'm about to
skin a bitch.

31:34.851 --> 31:37.093
I want you to double down
on the charm offense.

31:37.187 --> 31:40.601
You got her eating out of
your extra-diplomatic hands right now.

31:40.690 --> 31:43.524
I guess I could lube her up
some more about her alpacas.

31:43.610 --> 31:47.229
Yes, exactly. You, High King
Margo fucking Hanson,

31:47.322 --> 31:48.813
you got this.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.614
I know you didn't think
you could do this,

31:50.700 --> 31:53.613
but, honestly,
I think you're out-Elioting Eliot.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.157
Oh! Strawberry ricotta soufflÃ©
is done. I'm gonna get that.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.788
You get back to winning
at High King-in'.

32:06.299 --> 32:08.507
- Margo, what are you doing?
- Being the real me.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.633
Let me tell you how this
is going to play out, lady.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.461
You're going to give me
those beets,

32:12.556 --> 32:13.783
and I'm not going
to skin and eat

32:13.807 --> 32:16.345
any of your tasty alpaca
children, <i>capisce?</i>

32:18.395 --> 32:19.977
That's what I thought.

32:32.826 --> 32:34.943
What in the hell?

32:37.873 --> 32:39.205
Hi.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.374
I can't begin to imagine

32:41.460 --> 32:44.453
how you fucked yourself
hard enough to get here, but...

32:46.089 --> 32:48.001
...let's take advantage.

32:49.259 --> 32:51.251
Interesting choice
on the hair.

32:51.344 --> 32:53.381
Says the guy dressed
like an ambulance chaser.

32:54.890 --> 32:58.008
- So you're dead me.
- Technically.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.512
Does this mean
I'm dead, too?

32:59.769 --> 33:04.013
No, no, this is a, uh,
kind of between space?

33:04.107 --> 33:06.315
I saw you zapped yourself
here like an idiot,

33:06.401 --> 33:08.358
and I took
a coffee break.

33:08.445 --> 33:10.687
I mean, I've been
wanting to talk to you.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.341
So then I assume you know
that I took your...

33:12.365 --> 33:15.529
You took my spot
in my timeline? Yeah.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.860
Didn't expect that twist
with Julia, though.

33:17.954 --> 33:19.661
Yeah, I could say
the same about Kady.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.710
For what it's worth,
it never felt right taking your place.

33:26.796 --> 33:28.516
- But, you know...
- Everything feels wrong,

33:28.548 --> 33:31.336
so you just pick something?
Yeah, of course I do.

33:31.426 --> 33:32.758
Real talk...

33:34.095 --> 33:35.336
You gotta go back.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.012
To 23, I know,
I'm working on it.

33:37.098 --> 33:39.340
Uh, no. My timeline.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.346
It's where you belong.

33:41.436 --> 33:43.018
Okay, do you want
to cut the vague,

33:43.104 --> 33:45.437
omniscient Librarian shit
and just tell me why?

33:45.857 --> 33:48.099
It's complicated but crucial.

33:48.193 --> 33:49.855
You do know
me existing there

33:49.945 --> 33:53.109
is making some very important
horomancer lady very sick?

33:53.448 --> 33:55.531
It's doing a lot more
than that.

33:55.617 --> 33:59.076
Look, I know you lost
everyone you love in timeline 23...

33:59.162 --> 34:00.528
Really?

34:00.622 --> 34:03.080
But they're still alive
in timeline 40,

34:03.166 --> 34:05.533
and if I were you,
which I am,

34:05.627 --> 34:08.165
I'd do whatever
to not lose them again.

34:08.255 --> 34:11.498
Okay, you might be me,

34:11.591 --> 34:14.174
but you don't know me, okay?

34:14.261 --> 34:15.672
Those shits are not my people.

34:16.179 --> 34:19.513
Fair, but I know a little
about your future.

34:19.599 --> 34:20.760
Perks of the gig.

34:20.850 --> 34:23.092
So is being an abstruse dick
about it, apparently.

34:23.812 --> 34:24.928
Sonia can't be saved.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.513
Even if you go back to 23,
she's dead within a month.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.775
It's terminal. Period.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.838
Sounds like something I'd say to
make myself feel like less of an ass.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.024
Bigger things at play
than your guilt, buddy.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.400
You got to go back. Sorry.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.152
That's as specific
as I can be.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.451
Sorry? Are you?

34:40.536 --> 34:44.281
Dude, I just jumped you clear
over 1,000 miles of bullshit.

34:45.333 --> 34:48.542
So I'm sorry if it feels bad
in your soft little heart,

34:48.628 --> 34:51.416
but, more importantly,
you're welcome.

34:52.716 --> 34:54.581
But Kady wants you.

34:55.969 --> 34:57.460
They all want you.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.130
It's not
my timeline anymore.

35:02.726 --> 35:04.638
It's yours.

35:05.061 --> 35:09.931
So, you remember
that when the moment comes,

35:10.025 --> 35:11.266
I said, "Do it."

35:12.235 --> 35:13.817
Do what
he says, okay?

35:13.903 --> 35:16.190
No, not okay.
Vague as shit.

35:18.575 --> 35:19.927
To go back to 40,
you're gonna want to

35:19.951 --> 35:21.567
turn this dial
three clicks to the right.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.704
Tell Kady I love her,

35:26.499 --> 35:27.990
and I'm sorry.

35:34.591 --> 35:37.425
Well, thank Christ.
I thought you pissed off without me.

35:37.510 --> 35:39.718
- Where'd you go?
- It was, uh...

35:40.764 --> 35:42.676
I honestly don't know
how to explain it.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.761
But I know what
we got to do now.

35:53.234 --> 35:54.691
It's here.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.361
Oh, God.

36:02.452 --> 36:05.240
You were right,
there's a crack.

36:05.330 --> 36:08.243
I think it could split the pipe open
and let more ambient out.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.869
Here.

36:52.502 --> 36:53.604
Once you pour it
down the drain,

36:53.628 --> 36:54.855
- it should clean the water...
- Okay.

36:54.879 --> 36:56.620
...and clear the corrosion
from the pipes.

37:07.600 --> 37:08.807
Did I do something wrong?

37:08.893 --> 37:10.009
Huh?

37:10.145 --> 37:11.181
No, I just...

37:11.271 --> 37:14.355
I can't remember the last time
that magic wasn't the problem.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.816
This calls for
a drink.

37:26.453 --> 37:27.819
Thank you.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.902
Look, we'll find the stone. It'll be...

37:47.474 --> 37:48.681
What are you doing?

37:53.146 --> 37:54.432
Stop.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.889
Jesus.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.482
Those pills
can kill you.

38:05.575 --> 38:07.487
I'll take a new body.
I'm bored.

38:07.577 --> 38:11.787
You kill Eliot, and you can forget
about us helping you.

38:14.375 --> 38:17.163
Eliot, Eliot, Eliot.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.127
Why do you care
about him so much?

38:22.217 --> 38:24.459
Because I do.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.669
You kill him,
and we are done.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.263
I swear to God,
I am serious.

38:30.350 --> 38:32.137
I will abandon you,

38:32.227 --> 38:35.140
and I will die trying
to burn you to the ground.

38:41.611 --> 38:42.943
That's cute.

38:44.697 --> 38:46.984
But I'm strong...

38:48.785 --> 38:50.617
And you're weak.

38:50.703 --> 38:52.160
Break my bones,

38:53.790 --> 38:55.873
and strangle me.

38:57.919 --> 38:59.080
Too tired to care anymore.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.752
Q.

39:01.631 --> 39:04.920
You hurt him,
you take one more pill,

39:05.009 --> 39:07.217
and you can build your body
on your own.

39:11.724 --> 39:13.590
Fine.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.723
I'll take better care
of the meat suit.

39:20.024 --> 39:23.267
But you don't have to be
such a baby about it.

39:31.119 --> 39:34.533
Hey, what happened
with the game plan?

39:38.293 --> 39:40.535
Margo, are you okay?

39:42.547 --> 39:46.587
You stupid, stupid prick.

39:46.676 --> 39:50.090
How dare you say
I out-Elioted Eliot?

39:50.179 --> 39:51.761
Tell me. Hmm?

39:51.848 --> 39:54.682
Why would I ever want to do
anything without him?

39:54.767 --> 39:57.350
Hey, I'm sorry.

39:57.437 --> 39:59.224
I should have known
how you were feeling.

39:59.314 --> 40:02.523
Why? Because I like fettuccine
and I hate rosÃ©,

40:02.609 --> 40:03.770
you think you know me?

40:03.860 --> 40:05.271
You don't, Hoberman.

40:05.361 --> 40:07.318
Because if you did,
you would know

40:07.405 --> 40:09.271
I don't need a new
partner-in-crime.

40:09.365 --> 40:12.108
That's not...
I was just trying to help you.

40:12.201 --> 40:13.201
Bullshit.

40:14.412 --> 40:17.450
Now, I may be a cunt,
but I am real.

40:17.540 --> 40:20.283
You? You're just
a brown-nose sweater boy

40:20.376 --> 40:23.790
desperate to matter at all
to anyone.

40:24.923 --> 40:25.923
Wow.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.965
And here I thought
I was being

40:29.052 --> 40:30.668
a friend who wants
to be your boyfriend.

40:31.346 --> 40:34.134
I really, really
got to work on the signals.

40:35.892 --> 40:38.635
- Josh, I didn't...
- You didn't mean to hurt me?

40:38.728 --> 40:39.844
Yes, you did.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.305
Believe it or not, I know
exactly who you are, Margo.

40:54.577 --> 40:55.943
Took you long enough.

40:57.372 --> 40:58.954
I nearly gave up on you
making it back.

40:59.749 --> 41:02.162
Yeah, well, magic was
a little scarce in your timeline,

41:02.251 --> 41:04.664
so it took a minute
to rebuild.

41:04.754 --> 41:07.121
- Where's Marina?
- With her girlfriend.

41:08.424 --> 41:11.508
Listen, kid, we know you're trying
to look out for your mom.

41:11.594 --> 41:12.675
We get it.

41:12.762 --> 41:14.219
You saying you'll leave?

41:15.556 --> 41:16.797
Bigger things at play here.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.050
Sorry, man.
I'm not going anywhere.

41:24.774 --> 41:26.936
- Is that...
- Yeah.

41:28.277 --> 41:32.317
- It's from another timeline.
- Please. Don't blow on it.

41:32.407 --> 41:33.614
If you blow on it...

41:33.700 --> 41:35.612
It'll spread seeds everywhere,

41:36.119 --> 41:39.328
root itself in this timeline,
making it impossible for you to clean?

41:40.415 --> 41:41.747
I know,

41:41.833 --> 41:44.371
which is why I scattered
about 10 of them an hour ago.

41:48.256 --> 41:49.497
I'm sorry.

41:59.600 --> 42:00.600
Hey!

42:01.728 --> 42:04.812
What are you waiting for?
It's clean! It got fixed!

42:04.897 --> 42:06.388
I'm serious!

42:07.608 --> 42:09.349
Come on,
don't waste it!

42:12.238 --> 42:13.479
Whoo!

42:15.450 --> 42:16.861
You can go on ahead
if you want to.

42:16.951 --> 42:18.613
I'll meet you
back at the house.

42:18.703 --> 42:19.989
You sure?

42:20.079 --> 42:23.038
Yeah, I'm gonna
stick around a little while.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.871
All right,
I'll see you later.

42:35.762 --> 42:38.596
- Thanks for calling me.
- I knew you'd want to know.

42:38.681 --> 42:41.424
- I owe you.
- Nah.

42:41.517 --> 42:42.849
This is for all of us.

43:14.509 --> 43:16.626
Sheila Cozener?

43:16.719 --> 43:18.301
You've been a busy girl.
