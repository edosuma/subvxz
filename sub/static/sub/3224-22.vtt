00:03.642 --> 00:04.802
First time
I touched that Blade,

00:05.011 --> 00:06.371
I knew that I wouldn't be stopped,

00:06.512 --> 00:07.945
and that I would
take down Abaddon,

00:08.147 --> 00:09.347
and anything else if I had to.

00:09.548 --> 00:12.278
I'm glad the Blade gives you
strength or calm or whatever.

00:12.485 --> 00:15.246
I gotta say, I'm starting to think
that Blade is doing something else.

00:15.287 --> 00:17.414
So this war between angels
is really gonna happen, huh?

00:17.623 --> 00:19.113
Not if I can find
a diplomatic option.

00:19.325 --> 00:21.987
I know you truly believe
it's for the greater good.

00:22.194 --> 00:24.662
Your mistaken trust in Metatron
will bring you down again.

00:24.864 --> 00:26.661
The gates are sealed.
No one can get in.

00:26.866 --> 00:28.299
Who said anything about gates?

00:28.501 --> 00:30.541
You don't need gates
when you have a private portal.

00:30.703 --> 00:31.863
You can't hide something like that.

00:31.937 --> 00:34.064
You can if it moves around
from place to place,

00:34.273 --> 00:36.537
if it's wherever
the boss wants it to be.

00:36.742 --> 00:39.438
How's that stolen grace
inside you working out?

00:39.645 --> 00:41.636
- It's fine.
- No, it's not.

00:41.847 --> 00:42.905
- Dean.
- Do I know you?

00:43.115 --> 00:44.343
We go way back.

00:49.088 --> 00:50.088
Tessa.

00:50.256 --> 00:52.156
I know something they don't know,
the ending.

00:52.358 --> 00:56.761
How I get there doesn't matter as
long as everybody plays their part.

01:04.470 --> 01:08.429
Yeah. Give me one scoop of
the no-fat, non-dairy vanilla,

01:08.641 --> 01:10.601
with a quarter teaspoon
of the sugar-free caramel,

01:10.676 --> 01:13.770
and ten, not nine,
not eleven, blueberries.

01:14.213 --> 01:16.204
Got it? Good.

01:16.415 --> 01:17.415
What do you want, honey?

01:18.084 --> 01:19.517
That.

01:24.557 --> 01:27.549
Excuse me. I know this is
none of my business...

01:27.760 --> 01:29.887
You're right.
It's not. Go away.

01:30.096 --> 01:31.290
Where are your parents?

01:31.764 --> 01:33.391
I don't have parents.

01:33.599 --> 01:34.725
I'm an angel.

01:34.934 --> 01:36.959
Yeah, you're a little angel.

01:39.171 --> 01:41.901
Does your mother know you're sitting
here, eating diabetes?

01:43.843 --> 01:45.401
- You need to run.
- What?

01:47.213 --> 01:48.475
Now!

02:13.772 --> 02:15.205
Nice reflexes.

02:15.407 --> 02:16.874
Better hair.

02:17.076 --> 02:18.771
What's wrong with you?

02:18.978 --> 02:20.536
I could have shot you.

02:20.746 --> 02:23.408
Why aren't you sleeping?
We got in like two hours ago.

02:23.616 --> 02:25.379
Not tired.
And we got work to do,

02:25.584 --> 02:27.643
so put on your dancing shoes,
and let's boogie.

02:34.627 --> 02:35.992
All right.

02:36.729 --> 02:38.196
What's up?

02:38.397 --> 02:41.127
I called Cass. He said there's
something going down in Missouri.

02:41.934 --> 02:42.934
What kind of something?

02:43.502 --> 02:45.422
He said he couldn't talk
about it over the phone.

02:46.205 --> 02:49.470
- Why?
- Because he is a weird guy, okay?

02:49.675 --> 02:52.906
He's a weird, dorky, little guy.

02:53.112 --> 02:55.152
But he happens to have an army
of angels behind him,

02:55.214 --> 02:56.806
and, even though I hate to say it,

02:57.016 --> 03:00.452
if we're gonna take a shot
at Metatron, they might be useful.

03:01.353 --> 03:03.651
Do you think we need
the First Blade?

03:03.856 --> 03:05.949
Why don't we just leave that here?

03:06.158 --> 03:08.456
We talked about this,
and we decided that...

03:08.661 --> 03:12.563
No. In all fairness,
we didn't decide. You did.

03:12.765 --> 03:17.168
Okay, I decided that a hockey stick
that can kill anything

03:17.369 --> 03:19.098
might come in handy, so sue me.

03:19.305 --> 03:21.603
How many times have we
been around this block?

03:22.541 --> 03:24.372
Magic that powerful comes at a price,

03:24.577 --> 03:26.511
and right now we don't know
what that price is.

03:26.712 --> 03:28.577
I'm fine.

03:28.781 --> 03:31.272
- I'm fan-friggin'-tastic.
- And I'm glad, honestly.

03:31.483 --> 03:32.916
I'm not saying we bury the thing.

03:33.118 --> 03:36.246
I'm saying we just save it
for when we really need it.

03:36.455 --> 03:39.754
Crowley. Metatron.
The big boss fights.

03:39.959 --> 03:43.019
You don't have to have it
with you all the time, right?

03:43.596 --> 03:44.927
I mean, just leave it.

03:45.798 --> 03:47.231
Please.

03:51.637 --> 03:54.868
- No problem.
- Thank you.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.618
Agents Spears and Aguilera? FBI?

04:11.890 --> 04:14.757
- Uh-huh.
- Your partner said you'd be along.

04:16.595 --> 04:17.619
Thank you.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.699
Thank you for coming.

04:23.235 --> 04:24.429
Spears and Aguilera?

04:24.637 --> 04:27.868
I've noticed your aliases are usually
the names of popular musicians.

04:29.642 --> 04:30.642
Wow.

04:31.644 --> 04:33.305
Come here.
Take a look at this.

04:37.182 --> 04:39.650
Look. And the other bodies
are the same.

04:40.452 --> 04:41.817
Burnt-out husks.

04:42.021 --> 04:43.989
Okay, so, what is this,
some sort of mass smiting?

04:44.089 --> 04:45.351
I don't know what this was.

04:46.625 --> 04:48.115
Never seen anything like it.

04:48.794 --> 04:50.659
Six humans died here...

04:52.298 --> 04:53.663
And one angel.

04:56.568 --> 04:57.830
One of yours?

04:59.938 --> 05:01.064
Was a good soldier.

05:02.441 --> 05:03.738
This attack...

05:05.411 --> 05:09.040
I knew he wanted a war, but this...

05:10.182 --> 05:12.912
This is abhorrent, even for him.

05:23.595 --> 05:26.029
Uh... just a second!

05:31.670 --> 05:33.001
I gave you a second.

05:33.205 --> 05:36.834
You are such an angel sometimes.

05:37.042 --> 05:39.704
- What do you want?
- To talk about tonight.

05:41.246 --> 05:43.271
- We'll be fine.
- No, we...

05:44.183 --> 05:45.844
We're losing, Metatron.

05:46.051 --> 05:48.383
Castiel's followers outnumber us.

05:48.587 --> 05:51.750
And while they haven't gone
on offense, they have proven capable.

05:51.957 --> 05:54.721
They stopped you from killing him,
and me, for example.

05:54.927 --> 05:57.589
I told you, we had our shot
with operation Lee Harvey,

05:57.796 --> 05:59.559
and we took it.

05:59.765 --> 06:02.666
I gave the orders.
You weren't to be harmed.

06:02.868 --> 06:06.429
- You had me followed.
- Yeah, and you met with the enemy...

06:06.638 --> 06:07.900
In secret.

06:09.108 --> 06:11.906
What is that old line
about sins and stones?

06:14.246 --> 06:17.511
He spoke. He lied.
And I listened.

06:17.716 --> 06:19.240
That's it.

06:19.451 --> 06:21.112
But I serve Heaven.

06:21.320 --> 06:23.880
- I serve you.
- Good.

06:25.224 --> 06:26.691
Don't forget it.

06:30.596 --> 06:34.464
I mean, I don't get this
whole Cass love fest, either.

06:35.934 --> 06:38.630
I'm offering our people a way home,

06:38.837 --> 06:42.170
and still,
they're choosing him over me.

06:42.975 --> 06:44.670
I mean, sure, he's cute.

06:45.844 --> 06:50.907
And Castiel has this simple... charm.

06:53.051 --> 06:55.485
He's like a mentally deficient puppy.

06:56.688 --> 06:58.315
But I'm lovable.

06:59.324 --> 07:00.848
And funny.

07:04.029 --> 07:06.589
I made God laugh, twice!

07:06.799 --> 07:09.029
You're the one who asked him
to lead an army.

07:09.234 --> 07:11.429
Well, I didn't think
he'd be good at it.

07:12.237 --> 07:14.432
Your meeting tonight.
Tyrus.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.632
He controls the largest independent
faction of angels left, and...

07:17.843 --> 07:20.869
And I have to make
a good impression. I know.

07:22.281 --> 07:24.078
I've got a plan.

07:28.821 --> 07:30.755
It's not that, is it?

07:32.524 --> 07:34.219
Shut up!

07:37.095 --> 07:38.528
Commander.

07:39.298 --> 07:41.425
Oh, it's just creepy.

07:41.633 --> 07:43.760
Sam, Dean, this is Hannah.

07:45.771 --> 07:48.137
The Winchesters,
I've heard so much about you.

07:48.340 --> 07:50.240
What can I say?
Cass is a fan.

07:50.442 --> 07:53.240
- I'll start to examine this evidence.
- Oh, um...

07:53.445 --> 07:55.879
Sir, this morning,
Josiah wasn't at roll call.

07:57.282 --> 07:59.944
Roll call?
You hold a roll call?

08:00.152 --> 08:01.949
They like to hear me
say their names.

08:02.154 --> 08:03.951
I know a couple of women like that.

08:04.156 --> 08:05.680
No one's seen Josiah
since Ezra was murdered.

08:05.891 --> 08:06.891
We think that...

08:07.059 --> 08:09.059
You think Josiah's the killer,
that he is the mole?

08:09.161 --> 08:10.594
Well, who else?

08:11.597 --> 08:13.462
We searched the grounds,
but he's vanished.

08:13.665 --> 08:15.098
Not without wings.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.740
He's an angel, but he's still got
to travel like he's a human,

08:17.769 --> 08:20.966
which means walk, drive,
means he's gonna leave a trail.

08:21.373 --> 08:24.865
All right.
What was his vessel's name?

08:25.077 --> 08:28.012
- Sean Flynn from Omaha.
- Okay.

08:35.053 --> 08:36.679
This the guy?

08:36.889 --> 08:38.288
Yeah, that's him.

08:39.758 --> 08:41.054
All right.

08:41.894 --> 08:45.295
Someone just used his credit card
at a Gas-n-Sip in Colorado.

08:45.998 --> 08:48.057
And that's how we do things
in the pros.

08:49.268 --> 08:50.633
Commander.

08:53.038 --> 08:54.198
I have something.

08:54.606 --> 08:56.506
This phone's memory chip
has a video time-stamp

08:56.708 --> 08:57.766
just before the explosion.

08:57.976 --> 08:59.375
Now the moment you've all
been waiting for.

08:59.578 --> 09:00.909
- What?
- No!

09:03.215 --> 09:05.046
I do this for Castiel!

09:16.728 --> 09:19.629
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. I didn't...

09:20.966 --> 09:24.993
I would never ask an angel to
sacrifice himself to kill innocents.

09:26.071 --> 09:27.095
I'm gonna be sick.

09:27.306 --> 09:30.036
Cass, why would an angel blow up
a Colonel Scoop's in your name?

09:30.242 --> 09:32.335
That's not what he was doing.
Roll it back.

09:36.281 --> 09:37.942
There.

09:38.383 --> 09:39.873
That was an angel, Esther.

09:42.821 --> 09:44.049
She's one of Metatron's.

09:44.623 --> 09:46.716
- So, this was some kind of hit?
- I don't know.

09:46.925 --> 09:48.222
Stop saying you don't know.

09:48.427 --> 09:50.387
You can't think I would allow
something like this.

09:50.529 --> 09:51.996
Cass, I know you try
to be a good guy, okay?

09:52.197 --> 09:53.721
I do. You try.

09:53.932 --> 09:55.866
But what you got here,
this is a freakin' cult.

09:56.068 --> 09:58.229
- Dean...
- Last time you had a kind of juice,

09:58.437 --> 10:00.477
you did kill humans and angels,
and you did nothing,

10:00.672 --> 10:02.672
but lie to me and Sam
about it the whole damn time!

10:02.841 --> 10:05.469
Can we take this
somewhere else, guys?

10:09.348 --> 10:11.282
Stow the baggage, Dean.

10:11.483 --> 10:13.178
Look, we've got a case.

10:13.385 --> 10:14.943
Let's work it.

10:15.153 --> 10:17.713
Cass, did you know
the angel in that video?

10:17.923 --> 10:21.051
Yes. His name was Oren.
He was a new recruit.

10:21.259 --> 10:23.659
- He worked in community outreach.
- And what does that mean?

10:23.662 --> 10:26.256
Some of my troops are stationed
at a local hospital.

10:26.465 --> 10:27.989
They help where they can.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.691
Minor miracles. It's nothing
that would draw attention.

10:30.902 --> 10:33.063
What was he doing in that video,
with the stabbing?

10:33.271 --> 10:35.398
The Enochian runes
that were carved in his chest...

10:36.308 --> 10:39.402
I think that they
were meant to focus energy.

10:39.611 --> 10:41.806
When he stabbed himself,
it unleashed all that power.

10:42.014 --> 10:43.654
What about the girl?
What happened to her?

10:43.749 --> 10:46.047
If she was the target,
if the blast was focused on her,

10:46.251 --> 10:49.584
then more likely than not,
she was atomized.

10:52.658 --> 10:54.250
So, what do we do now?

10:54.459 --> 10:57.019
Well, you don't do jack.
Me and Sam will head to the hospital,

10:57.229 --> 10:59.663
see if we can find somebody
who knew this walking nuke.

10:59.865 --> 11:01.230
Hold on. These are my people.
I can help.

11:01.433 --> 11:02.900
Well, that's sort of the problem.

11:03.101 --> 11:05.331
I mean, the Manson girls aren't
gonna give us a straight answer

11:05.537 --> 11:08.005
with Charlie in the room,
so just hang back.

11:08.206 --> 11:10.106
So, I should just sit here?

11:10.709 --> 11:13.177
- Pretty much.
- No.

11:13.979 --> 11:15.241
If you don't want my help,

11:15.447 --> 11:17.779
then I will follow
Josiah's trail to Colorado.

11:18.817 --> 11:20.341
I have to do something, Dean.

11:22.554 --> 11:23.987
All right, fine.

11:24.856 --> 11:25.896
But Sam's coming with you.

11:26.091 --> 11:27.752
- What?
- Because you don't trust me?

11:27.959 --> 11:29.392
To help.

11:39.771 --> 11:41.363
Abaddon is dead.

11:43.642 --> 11:45.132
And then some.

11:46.044 --> 11:47.409
Oh, no.

11:48.146 --> 11:49.704
Okay. Um...

11:50.515 --> 11:51.948
Ominous.

11:53.785 --> 11:56.083
Does Dean seem different to you?

11:57.756 --> 11:59.018
Yeah.

11:59.691 --> 12:01.716
Lately, he seems to be...

12:02.728 --> 12:04.491
...amped up, you know, on edge.

12:04.696 --> 12:07.995
- Effects of the Mark?
- What else?

12:08.967 --> 12:10.195
He does seem angry.

12:10.402 --> 12:12.802
I mean, he's always a little angry,
but now it seems like...

12:13.638 --> 12:15.003
...more.

12:16.074 --> 12:17.803
I think a part of him
actually believed

12:18.009 --> 12:21.877
that I ordered those angels to,
you know...

12:24.549 --> 12:25.846
Sam, you don't, do you?

12:28.987 --> 12:31.046
No, man. Cass, listen.

12:31.723 --> 12:33.363
You got a weird thing
going on back there.

12:33.525 --> 12:35.015
Those other angels,
the way they stare at you...

12:35.227 --> 12:39.994
It's like you're part rock star,
part L. Ron.

12:41.566 --> 12:44.501
- They've put their faith in me.
- And maybe that's the problem.

12:44.703 --> 12:46.463
I mean, people have been
doing messed up crap

12:46.471 --> 12:47.904
in the name of faith...

12:48.774 --> 12:52.073
...in the name of God, since forever.

12:53.578 --> 12:55.068
Well...

12:55.747 --> 12:57.772
I'm not trying to play God.

12:57.983 --> 12:59.814
I'm just trying
to get my people home.

13:07.793 --> 13:09.590
Ha-ha! Yes!

13:09.795 --> 13:11.626
Well done!

13:12.430 --> 13:13.954
It's such a simple game.

13:14.166 --> 13:16.657
And boy, you got to love
the sound of those pins.

13:16.868 --> 13:20.929
Beautiful, a symphony of wood.

13:25.577 --> 13:27.807
So, you've heard our offer.

13:28.013 --> 13:29.844
Yeah, I sign on the dotted line,

13:30.048 --> 13:33.074
and, well, my people,
they get a ticket upstairs.

13:34.286 --> 13:35.514
What if we don't want to go?

13:35.720 --> 13:37.847
- But it's home.
- It's boring.

13:40.091 --> 13:42.924
I mean, there's nothing
like this in Heaven.

13:43.128 --> 13:45.961
I could whip you up
a bowling alley.

13:46.164 --> 13:48.098
Eh, but it wouldn't...

13:48.967 --> 13:50.730
I mean, just smell that.

13:53.905 --> 13:56.874
Old shoes and alcoholism? I...

13:57.075 --> 13:58.975
- Authenticity.
- So, wait.

13:59.177 --> 14:02.806
You're turning me down
because of... bowling?

14:03.014 --> 14:05.642
And I like being
an independent operator.

14:06.451 --> 14:08.214
And I hear you're losing.

14:09.187 --> 14:11.018
And I hate your face.

14:14.025 --> 14:15.253
Well, I could get a new face.

14:15.460 --> 14:20.227
You'd still be you, a nerd trying
to be one of the popular kids.

14:20.432 --> 14:22.161
Mm-mm.

14:22.367 --> 14:25.200
Okay. Time for the hard sell.

14:30.775 --> 14:32.367
Please.

14:32.577 --> 14:36.377
You knife me, and all my guys
will go running to Castiel.

14:42.854 --> 14:44.583
Even you're not that stupid.

14:46.691 --> 14:48.682
I tell you what, huh?

14:50.195 --> 14:52.663
You out-bowl me, we'll talk?

14:59.838 --> 15:01.169
Yeah, I saw him, officer.

15:01.373 --> 15:03.671
He filled up some old,
woody station wagon.

15:03.875 --> 15:06.343
Don't suppose you got
the license plate number?

15:06.544 --> 15:07.544
No.

15:07.779 --> 15:10.077
But he was headed to an address
in Pray, Montana.

15:10.882 --> 15:13.749
- How do you know that?
- Guy asked for directions.

15:13.985 --> 15:15.418
Oh.

15:15.620 --> 15:17.451
You want me to write that down?

15:17.656 --> 15:20.591
- Yes.
- Now. Please.

15:21.426 --> 15:22.825
What do I call you?

15:23.061 --> 15:24.653
My angelic name is 18 syllables long.

15:24.896 --> 15:27.660
- Let's stick with Flagstaff.
- Copy.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.832
So you knew this Oren guy?

15:31.036 --> 15:33.334
We worked together
at the hospital.

15:33.538 --> 15:36.564
He was a joy.
Bright, full of life.

15:36.775 --> 15:39.039
Yeah, I hear he had
a real explosive personality.

15:39.244 --> 15:41.838
- Do you think this is a joke?
- Do you see me laughing?

15:45.717 --> 15:47.810
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

15:48.687 --> 15:52.248
For example,
why he'd light his own fuse.

15:52.691 --> 15:55.956
No. Can I go?
I have lives to save.

15:56.294 --> 15:57.886
Welcome to the club.

15:59.698 --> 16:02.690
- Something funny?
- Not funny "ha ha."

16:03.001 --> 16:07.700
But you thinking you help people,
it's amusing.

16:07.906 --> 16:09.396
I help people.

16:09.607 --> 16:11.700
A clogged artery here,
a tumor there.

16:11.910 --> 16:12.968
I do good in this world.

16:13.178 --> 16:16.636
You believe every problem
can be solved with a gun.

16:16.848 --> 16:19.282
You play the hero,
but underneath the hype,

16:19.484 --> 16:22.647
you're a killer with oceans
of blood on his hands.

16:22.854 --> 16:25.084
I hate men like you.

16:26.224 --> 16:27.987
Mm.

16:32.697 --> 16:35.131
Honey, there ain't
no other men like me.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.858
Don't. Please.

16:38.069 --> 16:39.832
Oren. Friends?

16:40.939 --> 16:42.600
Constantine.

16:42.807 --> 16:44.138
And Tessa.

16:45.110 --> 16:48.341
- Tessa? The reaper, Tessa?
- You know her?

17:06.297 --> 17:08.857
That looks like the car the guy
at the gas station was talking about.

17:09.067 --> 17:10.659
Maybe Josiah's still around.

17:12.170 --> 17:15.970
Sam, this place is radiating power.

17:16.107 --> 17:19.838
I haven't felt anything like this
since... Since Heaven.

17:20.111 --> 17:21.703
We have to get in here.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.259
All right.

17:38.063 --> 17:39.587
Step aside.

17:41.332 --> 17:42.390
I got this.

17:51.743 --> 17:53.040
I don't got this.

18:05.056 --> 18:06.523
Howdy, Tessa.

18:11.129 --> 18:13.597
You're supposed to be working
at the hospital tonight,

18:13.798 --> 18:15.959
but when I stopped by,
you were gone.

18:16.167 --> 18:17.794
So was an ambulance.

18:19.838 --> 18:23.035
- Pro tip, they all have GPS.
- Good to know.

18:23.842 --> 18:26.208
So, you're here. Why?

18:26.411 --> 18:28.879
You just love musical theater?

18:29.080 --> 18:30.775
Only if it's Fiddler.

18:31.816 --> 18:34.808
- We need to talk.
- Can't. Sort of got a date.

18:39.891 --> 18:41.222
Not happening.

18:43.995 --> 18:45.656
Where's the other one?

18:45.864 --> 18:47.559
Where's Constantine?

18:50.802 --> 18:52.531
- Better luck next time.
- Thanks.

18:52.737 --> 18:54.136
Metatron!

18:56.808 --> 18:58.571
I do this for Castiel.

19:07.652 --> 19:10.348
I checked all the windows and doors.
No luck.

19:10.555 --> 19:12.455
What about you?
You find anything?

19:12.657 --> 19:14.181
I think so.

19:15.460 --> 19:17.018
It's Enochian.

19:18.062 --> 19:19.462
I believe it's some sort of riddle.

19:24.068 --> 19:25.968
"Why is six afraid of seven?"

19:27.071 --> 19:29.665
I assume it's
because seven is a prime number,

19:29.874 --> 19:32.468
and prime numbers
can be intimidating.

19:32.677 --> 19:34.668
It's because seven ate nine.

19:38.650 --> 19:40.174
It's wordplay.

19:40.852 --> 19:41.892
And the answer is the key,

19:42.053 --> 19:43.543
like the doors of Durin
in Lord of the Rings.

19:43.755 --> 19:45.279
Wait a second.

19:45.490 --> 19:47.515
You know about
The Lord of the Rings?

19:48.726 --> 19:50.717
I'm very pop-culture savvy now.

19:56.401 --> 19:58.494
- Hey.
- How is he?

19:58.703 --> 20:01.570
He's, uh... He's Cass.

20:01.773 --> 20:03.013
What about you? How's it going?

20:03.074 --> 20:05.508
Great. Went out, got some air.

20:05.710 --> 20:07.337
Met an old friend.

20:08.513 --> 20:10.504
Say hi to Sam, Tessa.

20:10.715 --> 20:13.616
- Your brother's a psycho, Sam.
-  Stop.

20:13.818 --> 20:16.252
- What's going on?
- You first.

20:16.454 --> 20:17.854
I know he's the commander's friend,

20:17.989 --> 20:19.909
and I know we're supposed
to pretend we like him,

20:20.091 --> 20:23.618
but that ape put a knife
to my throat.

20:24.996 --> 20:26.623
Tessa?

20:27.932 --> 20:30.162
- What are you doing?
- You want to tell her?

20:35.206 --> 20:36.400
Oh, God.

20:37.609 --> 20:40.100
There's no God.
There's only Castiel.

20:40.311 --> 20:42.040
Oh, and you're done.

20:45.783 --> 20:47.341
You wounded her.

20:51.823 --> 20:53.450
More like defused, okay?

20:53.658 --> 20:56.218
I cut up that old testament graffiti
she carved into herself.

20:56.427 --> 20:57.655
I figured that would break the spell.

20:57.862 --> 21:00.660
And now, what will you do to her?

21:02.834 --> 21:05.632
- Guess.
- Torture. Predictable.

21:05.837 --> 21:07.600
We need to know if there
are other bombers out there.

21:07.805 --> 21:10.501
No. I won't allow it.

21:10.708 --> 21:12.198
I know what Tessa was planning.

21:12.410 --> 21:17.347
It's horrible, but there's only
one person who can punish her.

21:18.283 --> 21:21.411
Let me guess. Yay big, trench coat,
sensible shoes?

21:21.719 --> 21:23.119
You have to understand that Castiel

21:23.288 --> 21:25.085
is the only thing
holding us together.

21:25.290 --> 21:26.951
A month ago,
half the angels in this place

21:27.158 --> 21:29.023
were trying to kill the other half.

21:29.227 --> 21:30.990
Castiel has given us a purpose.

21:31.329 --> 21:33.763
But more than that, he has
given us a way to live in peace.

21:33.965 --> 21:35.956
We have rules. Order.

21:36.167 --> 21:38.761
If I let you take matters
into your own hands,

21:38.970 --> 21:41.029
what's to stop one of them
from doing the same?

21:43.007 --> 21:45.066
You can talk to her.

21:45.276 --> 21:47.335
You should talk to her.

21:47.545 --> 21:49.376
But leave the Blade outside.

21:54.485 --> 21:57.852
- Are you asking or telling?
- We're not asking.

22:21.813 --> 22:23.542
You sure you don't want
to go back, Cass?

22:24.048 --> 22:26.073
Look, if Dean
is right about Tessa...

22:27.085 --> 22:29.485
No, I... I do.

22:29.687 --> 22:32.417
I just... Give me a second.

22:36.994 --> 22:39.428
"Only the penitent man
shall pass"?

22:43.101 --> 22:44.591
Cass, wait!

23:07.525 --> 23:09.152
The Last Crusade?

23:09.360 --> 23:10.384
Okay.

23:12.196 --> 23:14.221
Well, let's start with an easy one.

23:14.432 --> 23:15.899
Who are you working for?

23:16.100 --> 23:17.624
- Castiel.
- Liar.

23:20.138 --> 23:23.232
People like you,
they never understand.

23:23.441 --> 23:25.466
Sacrifices have to be made.

23:27.245 --> 23:28.769
So you go after
one of the bad guys,

23:28.980 --> 23:31.414
and if a few humans
get microwaved,

23:31.616 --> 23:33.777
no big deal, right?

23:33.985 --> 23:36.647
In the grand scheme,
they don't matter.

23:36.854 --> 23:38.185
Oh, Tessa, you are so wrong.

23:41.192 --> 23:45.253
When Castiel came to me
and told me what I had to do,

23:45.463 --> 23:48.227
he said I was chosen
because I was strong.

23:49.500 --> 23:52.060
Others...

23:52.270 --> 23:53.897
...they couldn't handle this.

23:55.940 --> 23:57.339
They're too weak.

24:05.149 --> 24:06.343
Settle down!

24:06.551 --> 24:09.918
Is... Do you think
she's telling the truth?

24:11.656 --> 24:13.180
She thinks she is.

24:18.029 --> 24:21.590
- Sam. We found it.
- What?

24:22.967 --> 24:25.629
- It's the door to Heaven.
- Seriously?

24:27.071 --> 24:30.006
What else would Metatron go to such
great lengths to protect?

24:30.208 --> 24:33.575
I can hear it.
It's calling to me, Sam.

24:33.778 --> 24:37.509
If we control this door,
we can take the fight to Metatron.

24:39.750 --> 24:42.048
We may not even need
to fight at all.

24:42.253 --> 24:43.880
Cass, wait.

24:59.403 --> 25:01.030
What the hell?

25:13.217 --> 25:16.380
"Welcome to your own personal
heaven, Castiel.

25:16.587 --> 25:18.612
Good luck finding the real one."

25:19.891 --> 25:21.518
Why?

25:30.535 --> 25:32.093
It's Josiah.

25:32.303 --> 25:34.134
He reeks of holy oil.

25:37.642 --> 25:38.768
Yeah.

25:38.976 --> 25:40.876
Looks like he got
Home Alone-ed.

25:44.348 --> 25:47.613
So, all of this was a lie.

25:49.053 --> 25:50.645
Supposed to be here.

25:51.522 --> 25:52.955
Gate.

25:53.457 --> 25:55.152
He told me...

25:55.359 --> 25:59.352
After Ezra, he told me
that I should come to him.

26:00.898 --> 26:04.231
Metatron told me
that I could go home.

26:05.736 --> 26:07.601
I just wanted to go home.

26:08.639 --> 26:10.607
- Here. Let me...
- No!

26:11.509 --> 26:14.603
I would rather die than owe
my life to you, Castiel.

26:16.647 --> 26:18.945
You play at being noble.

26:20.151 --> 26:22.551
You play at being one of us.

26:24.188 --> 26:25.985
But I look into your eyes...

26:27.325 --> 26:29.987
...and I don't see
an angel staring back at me.

26:46.677 --> 26:50.204
- Where's your friend?
- Just you and me now.

26:51.248 --> 26:54.376
Let's talk about us.
I mean, we got history, yeah?

26:54.585 --> 26:55.882
Sure.

26:56.087 --> 26:58.021
I still remember our meet-cute.

26:58.756 --> 26:59.984
You were dying.

27:00.591 --> 27:01.717
Good times.

27:02.893 --> 27:04.292
Here's the deal.

27:04.495 --> 27:07.293
I like you, Tess, okay?
For an angel.

27:07.498 --> 27:09.295
But tell me,
why are you doing this?

27:09.500 --> 27:10.694
Castiel.

27:10.901 --> 27:13.802
No, forget Cass.
Why are you doing this?

27:14.005 --> 27:16.667
What would make a person want
to pop their top, huh?

27:16.874 --> 27:18.569
I mean, look,
I've been in bad shape.

27:18.776 --> 27:21.006
I have. But I have never been
that damn low.

27:24.248 --> 27:26.512
I guess I just
can't take the screaming.

27:31.689 --> 27:33.213
Who's screaming?

27:34.725 --> 27:38.058
All of them.
The lost souls.

27:38.896 --> 27:40.420
The ones that can't get
into Heaven

27:40.631 --> 27:42.462
now that it's been boarded up.

27:43.300 --> 27:44.767
I hear them.

27:45.903 --> 27:47.666
They are so confused.

27:49.373 --> 27:51.068
They're in so much pain.

27:53.010 --> 27:55.001
All I want to do is help them.

27:55.212 --> 27:57.680
It's what I do.
It's my job.

27:59.583 --> 28:01.175
But I can't.

28:01.852 --> 28:03.683
So I suffered...

28:04.755 --> 28:10.716
...until death... nothingness.

28:13.831 --> 28:15.423
Suddenly, it didn't seem so bad.

28:17.735 --> 28:19.327
It seemed quiet.

28:19.537 --> 28:21.198
So why don't you
just jam an Angel Blade

28:21.405 --> 28:23.100
in your throat and call it a day?

28:24.475 --> 28:28.036
I thought about it,
but I was too weak.

28:29.413 --> 28:31.643
Till Castiel gave me
a reason to die.

28:31.849 --> 28:33.009
Yeah.

28:33.217 --> 28:35.185
See, that just doesn't sound
like the Cass I know.

28:37.188 --> 28:39.179
But doesn't it, though?

28:39.390 --> 28:41.381
And the Cass you know,
would he raise

28:41.592 --> 28:43.719
an army of angels
without telling you?

28:45.663 --> 28:47.756
'Cause this Cass did.

28:49.867 --> 28:51.562
I'll tell you a secret.

28:53.070 --> 28:55.004
There's more out there.

28:55.773 --> 28:57.240
Like me.

28:58.042 --> 29:00.135
- So many more.
- You got names?

29:02.680 --> 29:04.307
That would ruin all the fun.

29:04.515 --> 29:06.312
No.

29:06.517 --> 29:08.109
No, see...

29:12.256 --> 29:13.985
...the fun's just getting started.

29:14.191 --> 29:16.591
- Dean, what have you done?
- What I had to.

29:18.562 --> 29:19.893
Welcome to the club.

29:25.136 --> 29:26.569
Thank you.

30:01.005 --> 30:02.632
He put up a fight.

30:04.175 --> 30:05.642
Get out.

30:08.078 --> 30:09.841
You should have seen
the other ten guys.

30:10.047 --> 30:13.073
- They said you killed Tessa?
- Not so much.

30:13.284 --> 30:14.717
She knifed herself.

30:15.252 --> 30:16.776
Yeah? Why would she
do that, Dean?

30:16.987 --> 30:18.545
I don't know, Sam.

30:18.756 --> 30:20.076
She was saying all kinds of crap.

30:20.090 --> 30:22.456
So that's why you brought out
the First Blade?

30:24.161 --> 30:26.686
- They told you about that, huh?
- We had a deal.

30:26.897 --> 30:29.263
- Well, it was a stupid deal.
- Really?

30:29.466 --> 30:32.026
'Cause if you'd stuck to it,
Tessa would still be alive.

30:32.236 --> 30:33.476
Without her, we ain't got jack.

30:33.604 --> 30:35.731
You think I don't know that?
You think I wanted that to happen?

30:35.940 --> 30:37.066
I don't know, Dean.
Did you?

30:37.274 --> 30:39.333
All right, that's enough.
Stop it.

30:40.010 --> 30:44.344
Commander, I'm sorry,
but you have a call.

30:45.649 --> 30:47.139
From Metatron.

30:56.961 --> 30:58.326
Castiel.

30:58.529 --> 31:00.292
Bet you're not happy to see me.

31:00.497 --> 31:02.124
Is anyone, ever?

31:02.333 --> 31:07.430
Dean, always with the B-grade
'80s-action-movie wit.

31:08.572 --> 31:10.199
What do you want, Metatron?

31:10.407 --> 31:13.774
Just to tell ass-tiel, there,
that I'm still alive.

31:13.978 --> 31:15.605
His bomber failed.

31:15.813 --> 31:18.179
- My bomber?
- The crazy guy.

31:18.382 --> 31:20.111
Big knife. Kablooey.

31:20.317 --> 31:25.380
I'm fine, thanks for asking,
but Gadreel is wounded, and Tyrus...

31:26.891 --> 31:28.119
...RIP.

31:28.325 --> 31:31.021
His followers are not
your biggest fans, by the way.

31:31.228 --> 31:34.527
- They've all come over to my team.
- I didn't send anyone to kill you.

31:34.732 --> 31:36.791
Oh, stop lying, Castiel.

31:37.001 --> 31:41.938
Who are you to lecture me on lying?
Your deception led to the fall.

31:42.139 --> 31:44.972
I did what I had to do.

31:45.175 --> 31:48.611
I have always done
what I have to do,

31:48.812 --> 31:51.474
for God and for the angels.

31:51.682 --> 31:54.276
Sure. Yeah, you're Mother Teresa
with neck beard.

31:54.485 --> 31:56.680
What I did was
neither good nor bad.

31:56.887 --> 32:02.052
It was necessary, a small hardship
to make us all stronger,

32:02.259 --> 32:03.658
to make us a family again.

32:03.861 --> 32:06.261
Yeah, except for the angels
you had Gadreel kill.

32:07.564 --> 32:09.930
Okay, yes.

32:10.134 --> 32:13.194
Maybe I got
a little carried away at first,

32:13.404 --> 32:15.269
but those days are over.

32:15.472 --> 32:18.134
A near-death experience
makes you re-evaluate.

32:18.342 --> 32:23.370
So, one time only,
I'm offering amnesty.

32:23.948 --> 32:27.748
Every angel,
no matter what their sin,

32:27.952 --> 32:30.443
may join me and return to Heaven.

32:32.156 --> 32:34.283
I will be their God,

32:34.491 --> 32:37.688
and they can be
my heavenly host.

32:37.895 --> 32:39.658
Why would we follow you?

32:39.863 --> 32:42.593
Well, look around.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.461
You've seen earth.

32:44.668 --> 32:46.602
You've had a taste of free will.

32:46.804 --> 32:48.772
I got to ask you,
do you like it?

32:48.973 --> 32:52.101
I mean, the way you've flocked
off to follow Castiel

32:52.309 --> 32:55.244
tells me you need
to follow someone.

32:55.446 --> 32:56.640
It's in your DNA.

32:56.847 --> 33:01.147
But Cass,
he's not what you think he is.

33:01.352 --> 33:04.617
He sends angels out to die.

33:06.523 --> 33:09.788
Have you told them about
your stolen grace, Castiel?

33:11.562 --> 33:13.587
How it's fading away,

33:13.797 --> 33:16.698
and when it burns out,
so will you?

33:19.103 --> 33:21.367
So...

33:21.572 --> 33:22.937
...no, then.

33:25.409 --> 33:29.209
I'm not the best,
but I'm the best you've got.

33:29.413 --> 33:32.041
You want to stay with Castiel, fine,

33:32.249 --> 33:35.309
but he's playing you,
because at the end of the day,

33:35.519 --> 33:36.952
the only thing he cares about

33:37.154 --> 33:39.452
is himself
and the Hardy boys there.

33:41.425 --> 33:43.120
You've got a choice to make.

33:43.327 --> 33:45.227
Make the right one.

33:52.636 --> 33:54.831
- He's lying.
- About the grace?

33:58.208 --> 33:59.505
It's complicated.

34:00.344 --> 34:01.743
So he wasn't lying.

34:01.945 --> 34:04.539
He was about
everything else. He...

34:13.157 --> 34:16.489
- You believe me, don't you?
- I want to believe you, but I...

34:21.431 --> 34:23.456
- We need proof.
- Name it.

34:23.667 --> 34:25.658
- Punish him.
- What?

34:25.869 --> 34:28.303
He murdered Tessa.
He broke our rules.

34:28.505 --> 34:30.735
Y'all can all go to hell.

34:30.940 --> 34:32.431
Dean.

34:32.643 --> 34:34.167
Hey, wait a sec...

34:35.112 --> 34:39.514
You gave us order, Castiel,
and we gave you our trust.

34:41.784 --> 34:43.581
Don't lose it over one man.

34:48.559 --> 34:49.992
This is justice.

35:14.952 --> 35:17.216
No. I can't.

35:26.396 --> 35:28.125
Goodbye, Castiel.

35:54.491 --> 35:56.516
You're right.

35:56.727 --> 35:58.388
There is no other side.

36:00.797 --> 36:02.424
Well, welcome aboard.

36:05.802 --> 36:07.861
Well...

36:08.071 --> 36:11.336
...the first of Castiel's flock
has come around.

36:11.542 --> 36:13.339
The rest will follow.

36:13.544 --> 36:17.674
You should have told me
what our elite unit was for.

36:17.881 --> 36:19.246
Why? It was none
of your business.

36:19.449 --> 36:21.781
Tessa, Constantine.

36:22.619 --> 36:24.746
I recruited them, and you...

36:25.856 --> 36:28.051
...brainwashed them
into blowing themselves up.

36:28.559 --> 36:30.823
So?

36:31.395 --> 36:35.695
Well, that's an old writer's trick,
flipping the script.

36:36.967 --> 36:41.461
You start by building up
a seemingly unbeatable enemy,

36:41.672 --> 36:43.299
like the Death Star,

36:43.507 --> 36:47.568
or a rival angel with a bigger army.

36:48.679 --> 36:50.374
That way,
I look like the underdog.

36:50.581 --> 36:52.674
But then, oh, no!

36:52.883 --> 36:55.545
The competition gets greedy.

36:55.752 --> 36:58.243
He starts pushing things too much.

36:59.556 --> 37:03.219
With the help
of my combustible double agents.

37:03.427 --> 37:06.555
And then, after a rousing speech,

37:06.763 --> 37:09.095
his true weakness is revealed.

37:10.667 --> 37:13.397
He's in love with humanity.

37:14.771 --> 37:16.329
And now...

37:20.611 --> 37:22.442
...I'm inevitable.

37:23.914 --> 37:27.179
- What about Josiah?
- Mm.

37:27.384 --> 37:29.784
He was a loose end.

37:29.987 --> 37:34.447
I told him where the gate was...
before we moved it.

37:35.659 --> 37:39.254
Oh! I just wish Cass had walked
into one of those traps.

37:40.797 --> 37:43.732
Anyway, point is,

37:43.934 --> 37:47.097
while everyone else
is playing checkers,

37:47.304 --> 37:49.534
I'm playing Monopoly,

37:49.740 --> 37:52.709
and I always build a hotel
on Boardwalk.

37:54.645 --> 37:56.704
And I always win.

38:24.041 --> 38:26.009
So, Dean, uh...

38:26.209 --> 38:28.006
Are we gonna talk about this,
or what?

38:28.211 --> 38:29.371
About what?

38:29.579 --> 38:31.877
Yeah, I lied,
but you were being an infant.

38:33.350 --> 38:36.217
Wow. Even for you,
that apology sucked.

38:36.420 --> 38:37.785
Oh, I'm not apologizing.

38:37.988 --> 38:39.649
I'm telling you
how it's gonna be.

38:40.257 --> 38:41.257
Dean, that Blade...

38:41.425 --> 38:43.086
That Blade's the only thing
that can kill Metatron,

38:43.293 --> 38:44.733
and I am the only one
who can use it.

38:46.163 --> 38:48.131
So from here on out,
I'm calling the shots.

38:48.332 --> 38:49.765
Capisce?

38:50.801 --> 38:53.736
Look, until I jam that blade
through that douchebag's heart,

38:53.937 --> 38:55.427
we are not a team.

38:55.639 --> 38:57.334
This is a dictatorship.

38:57.574 --> 39:00.042
Now, you don't have to like it,
but that's how it's gonna be.

39:07.751 --> 39:09.412
So, batteries.

39:12.589 --> 39:14.318
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

39:15.192 --> 39:16.557
How long you got?

39:17.294 --> 39:19.387
Long enough
to destroy Metatron, I hope.

39:21.798 --> 39:23.663
But without an army...

39:24.234 --> 39:25.462
Well, hey, you still got us.

39:30.407 --> 39:31.635
Dean.

39:33.143 --> 39:36.670
Those bombers,
you don't really think that I...

39:36.880 --> 39:39.246
Cass, you just gave up
an entire army for one guy.

39:40.550 --> 39:42.984
No, there's no way
that you blew those people away.

39:49.426 --> 39:51.519
You really believe
we three will be enough?

39:54.097 --> 39:55.621
We always have been.

40:02.139 --> 40:03.470
Guys!

40:04.708 --> 40:06.403
I'm not here to fight.

40:08.845 --> 40:11.006
I thought about what you said.

40:11.214 --> 40:13.774
You're right.
Metatron, he's...

40:16.319 --> 40:17.911
Something needs to be done.

40:18.321 --> 40:20.118
And we should trust you why?

40:20.323 --> 40:22.052
Because I can give him to you.

40:22.259 --> 40:24.056
I know where Metatron is.

40:24.261 --> 40:26.126
I know everything.

40:28.098 --> 40:29.827
I know the bombers. They...

40:31.301 --> 40:33.997
They were his agents, not yours.

40:38.909 --> 40:41.571
You don't trust me, fine.
I understand. I've...

40:43.713 --> 40:45.146
...made mistakes.

40:46.216 --> 40:47.615
But haven't you?

40:48.218 --> 40:49.515
Haven't we all?

40:52.756 --> 40:55.190
At least give me a chance.
