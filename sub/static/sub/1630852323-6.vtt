<i>-[Sharelle] God, y'all are looking nice!</i>

<i>-[Tennille] Money bag!</i>

00:30.155 --> 00:33.366

00:47.047 --> 00:49.174
<i>-[Anne] All right.</i>
<i>-[Alexis] More talking, more talking.</i>

00:49.924 --> 00:53.094
<i>[Sharelle] So before we kick off</i>

00:53.178 --> 00:57.724
<i>after all the hard work</i>
<i>that me and Juawana put into Miami,</i>

00:57.807 --> 00:59.350

<i>-The Mielle client.</i>
<i>-[all cheering and clapping]</i>

01:02.437 --> 01:04.773
<i>-[Anne] Congratulations, Jarelle!</i>
<i>-[Colony] Okay, ladies!</i>

01:04.856 --> 01:06.316
<i>Good job, Jarelle!</i>

01:06.399 --> 01:10.028
<i>This is the biggest deal for Allure,</i>
<i>$7.5 million.</i>

01:10.111 --> 01:12.155
<i>Celebratory dinner, on y'all?</i>

01:12.238 --> 01:15.784
<i>-Well, I mean, was Miami enough?</i>
<i>-[all laughing]</i>

01:16.367 --> 01:18.161
<i>-[Alexis] No.</i>
<i>-We need another one!</i>

01:18.244 --> 01:20.997
<i>We need y'all to produce too,</i>
<i>so y'all can take us to dinner!</i>

01:21.081 --> 01:24.042
<i>[Colony] That's motivation!</i>
<i>We're gonna keep working on it.</i>

01:24.125 --> 01:25.627
<i>[Sharelle] But we're setting the bar.</i>

01:25.710 --> 01:27.295
<i>And you know, I always say this.</i>

01:27.378 --> 01:31.841
<i>It's already hard for us as minorities</i>
<i>to get into that luxury market,</i>

01:31.925 --> 01:34.302
<i>and I want to show you guys</i>
<i>it can be done.</i>

01:34.886 --> 01:37.138
<i>This is the moment</i>
<i>that I knew could happen.</i>

01:37.222 --> 01:40.683

01:40.767 --> 01:44.479

01:44.562 --> 01:45.772

01:56.783 --> 01:58.493
<i>[Sharelle] And this is only the beginning.</i>

01:58.576 --> 02:01.621
<i>Like, I put it out there,</i>
<i>I manifested that we're gonna get there,</i>

02:01.704 --> 02:03.915
<i>and we're gonna get there</i>
<i>by any means necessary.</i>

02:03.998 --> 02:08.670
<i>This is why I'm having this talk today,</i>
<i>because I want everybody on the same page.</i>

02:08.753 --> 02:13.675
<i>I don't want you ladies to feel like</i>
<i>only a few people have to produce.</i>

02:13.758 --> 02:16.261
<i>So we're going to have a conversation.</i>

02:16.344 --> 02:17.846
<i>If it takes cutting…</i>

02:19.430 --> 02:21.599
<i>I want y'all to know that this is serious.</i>

<i>You're not here to hang your license</i>
<i>just to hang them, just for the looks.</i>

02:26.020 --> 02:29.149
<i>I mean business and I want</i>
<i>you ladies to mean business too.</i>

02:29.899 --> 02:30.900
<i>So,</i>

02:31.734 --> 02:36.281
<i>while we're starting this conversation,</i>
<i>I want to tell Karla and Alexis,</i>

02:36.364 --> 02:38.116
<i>I'mma need y'all to step it up.</i>

02:38.199 --> 02:42.036
<i>Allure is growing, and</i>
<i>I need everybody to be heavy hitters.</i>

02:42.120 --> 02:45.331
<i>You'll start seeing some stuff coming,</i>
<i>because I am working on something.</i>

02:45.415 --> 02:48.710
<i>[Sharelle] How's the open house coming</i>
<i>along for our new listing with Arturo?</i>

02:48.793 --> 02:50.545
<i>Do you want to be part of our future?</i>

02:50.628 --> 02:52.255
<i>Of course we do!</i>

02:52.338 --> 02:54.632
<i>[Karla] This weekend,</i>
<i>you will actually be happy for me.</i>

02:54.716 --> 02:58.344
<i>I decided to go ahead and have</i>
<i>another stager coming in--</i>

02:58.428 --> 02:59.929
<i>Okay, that's what I want.</i>

03:00.013 --> 03:02.098
<i>I want something.</i>
<i>I'm letting you ladies know,</i>

03:02.182 --> 03:04.934
<i>if you don't take it serious,</i>
<i>we're going to have to--</i>

03:05.018 --> 03:06.019
<i>I'll walk out myself.</i>

03:06.102 --> 03:08.354
<i>I need producing agents here.</i>

03:09.397 --> 03:11.316
<i>And that goes for you too, Alexis.</i>

03:11.399 --> 03:14.277
<i>-I knew my name was gonna get brought up.</i>
<i>-I'm putting it out there.</i>

03:14.360 --> 03:15.612
<i>There's no more chances.</i>

03:15.695 --> 03:17.989
<i>Y'all know I have an open-door policy.</i>

03:18.072 --> 03:20.491
<i>There shouldn't be any side conversations.</i>

03:20.575 --> 03:22.952
<i>If you want to leave,</i>
<i>I'm not begging no one to stay,</i>

03:23.036 --> 03:25.955
<i>but I don't want you to feel</i>
<i>like you're uncomfortable here either.</i>

03:26.039 --> 03:29.083
<i>And if you have a problem, come to me.</i>

03:29.167 --> 03:30.835
<i>So if you're not comfortable here,</i>

<i>you can definitely leave.</i>

<i>What's the real reason</i>
<i>you brought us out here?</i>

04:26.224 --> 04:29.560
<i>Well, I spoke with Rena in Miami.</i>

04:31.479 --> 04:33.982
<i>She didn't come off rude or anything.</i>
<i>She was explaining herself,</i>

04:34.065 --> 04:38.236
<i>and I'm like, "Wait, why would she invite</i>
<i>two of my top producing agents?"</i>

04:38.319 --> 04:41.948
<i>And I know we done had</i>
<i>some situations going on.</i>

04:42.031 --> 04:44.075
<i>I just wanted to</i>
<i>get y'all's side of the story</i>

04:44.158 --> 04:45.952
<i>because, you know,</i>
<i>it's always three sides.</i>

04:46.786 --> 04:52.125
<i>Listen, she invited us there</i>
<i>to try to recruit for her new brokerage.</i>

04:54.836 --> 04:57.422
<i>But she didn't tell me</i>
<i>she tried to recruit y'all,</i>

04:57.505 --> 04:59.549
<i>and that's why I have a fucking problem.</i>

05:00.800 --> 05:03.136
<i>To me, that was… I didn't like it.</i>

05:03.219 --> 05:04.887
<i>Yeah. I felt like it was very shady.</i>

05:04.971 --> 05:06.222
<i>I didn't like that at all.</i>

05:06.306 --> 05:08.933
<i>So personally, from my standpoint,</i>

05:09.017 --> 05:13.604
<i>I think that, you know, if she wants</i>
<i>a brokerage, okay, so be it!</i>

05:13.688 --> 05:15.857
<i>I do think it was a little, you know…</i>

05:15.940 --> 05:20.361
<i>It was a little under the table to pull us</i>
<i>to the side to talk to us about it.</i>

05:21.988 --> 05:25.033
<i>Anne, it's just… I don't know,</i>
<i>I just find it funny. I don't know.</i>

05:25.116 --> 05:29.370
<i>It sounds like a new tone today</i>
<i>when we're with Sharelle,</i>

05:29.454 --> 05:32.707
<i>because at the house, you were more like,</i>

05:32.790 --> 05:36.419
<i>"Yeah, Rena,</i>
<i>I'm definitely gonna consider it</i>

05:36.502 --> 05:38.838
<i>-because I'm not really happy at Allure."</i>
<i>-Mmm-hmm.</i>

05:40.798 --> 05:43.426
<i>So we're in a completely</i>
<i>different environment,</i>

05:43.509 --> 05:45.887
<i>so that conversation</i>
<i>that we were having with Rena,</i>

05:45.970 --> 05:48.806
<i>it didn't call for me to talk about,</i>
<i>"Oh, I love Allure."</i>

05:48.890 --> 05:52.977
<i>At that point, we were talking about</i>
<i>the reasons why I'd want to leave Allure,</i>

05:53.061 --> 05:55.897
<i>and why I was open to that opportunity.</i>

05:55.980 --> 05:58.900
<i>I'm not in the same conversation like,</i>
<i>"I love Allure," because that's not--</i>

05:58.983 --> 06:00.193
<i>But I did.</i>

06:01.527 --> 06:06.657
<i>Anne is pretty much downplaying</i>
<i>her conversation with Rena that day,</i>

06:06.741 --> 06:10.203
<i>and you know,</i>
<i>I just got to keep it real at this point.</i>

06:10.286 --> 06:12.580
<i>-You did, because…</i>
<i>-We were in the same setting.</i>

06:12.663 --> 06:13.915
<i>Those were your sentiments.</i>

06:13.998 --> 06:15.458
<i>But it's just how it is.</i>

06:15.541 --> 06:18.294
<i>I can see if you presented this to me</i>

06:18.378 --> 06:23.091
<i>saying, "Sharelle, I don't feel valued.</i>
<i>I'm a hard-ass worker, your top producer,</i>

06:23.174 --> 06:25.551
<i>and I don't feel</i>
<i>like you value what I do."</i>

06:25.635 --> 06:27.929
<i>-[Anne] Mmm-hmm.</i>
<i>-You never came to me about that, Anne.</i>

06:28.429 --> 06:32.642
<i>When things get rough, is that</i>
<i>what we do? Just jump ship and be out?</i>

06:33.768 --> 06:36.062
<i>[Anne] I definitely</i>
<i>am looking at Colony like,</i>

06:36.145 --> 06:40.525
<i>"Girl, like, can you</i>
<i>be quiet for, like, a second?"</i>

06:40.608 --> 06:43.528
<i>I almost want to, like,</i>
<i>pinch her under the table.</i>

06:43.611 --> 06:47.532
<i>All of this loyalty to Sharelle.</i>
<i>What about loyalty to me?</i>

06:47.615 --> 06:48.783
<i>Not necessarily.</i>

06:48.866 --> 06:52.370
<i>But I think one thing that has</i>
<i>always been the same about me,</i>

06:52.453 --> 06:55.123
<i>is I'm always open</i>
<i>to looking at new opportunities.</i>

06:55.206 --> 06:59.419
<i>And I do think that, you know,</i>
<i>two brokerages can coexist.</i>

06:59.502 --> 07:02.004
<i>It's okay for Rena</i>
<i>to go open up her own brokerage.</i>

07:02.088 --> 07:03.673
<i>By any means, you can go do it.</i>

07:03.756 --> 07:05.466
<i>Hell, you can</i>
<i>open up an office next to me.</i>

07:05.550 --> 07:07.677
<i>You're no competition when it comes to me.</i>

07:07.760 --> 07:09.220
<i>I know what I bring to the table.</i>

07:09.303 --> 07:13.099
<i>I can give you my recipe, and you still</i>
<i>won't make the sauce like I make it.</i>

<i>-Yeah.</i>

<i>-On a $14 million house.</i>
<i>-[Anne] Fourteen million, Alexis?</i>

08:09.572 --> 08:12.950
<i>-And the taxes are like 90,000.</i>
<i>-I was way off!</i>

<i>I know that I have been warned</i>
<i>about my performance.</i>

08:27.715 --> 08:32.428
<i>At this point, I'm literally</i>
<i>floating on, like, thin ice, literally.</i>

08:32.512 --> 08:34.889
<i>My client, he was upset when he called me,</i>

08:34.972 --> 08:37.558
<i>because it was crazy</i>
<i>that you were that off.</i>

08:37.642 --> 08:40.770
<i>That's not like me. I've shown houses,</i>
<i>and I've never had an issue.</i>

08:40.853 --> 08:43.481

<i>by a puff of smoke.</i>

<i>I haven't actually got to the point where</i>
<i>I'm this big producer like I want to be,</i>

08:55.993 --> 08:59.914
<i>and I'm trying, but my home life is hard</i>
<i>because I don't have help.</i>

08:59.997 --> 09:02.542
<i>Y'all know my mom was super sick,</i>
<i>I have to be there for her.</i>

09:02.625 --> 09:06.754
<i>And Michael, he used to play in the NFL,</i>
<i>so he's still making his transition,</i>

09:06.837 --> 09:08.756
<i>and it's constantly being drained on me.</i>

09:08.839 --> 09:12.218
<i>-So I'm trying to be the mother--</i>
<i>-You're holding everything down.</i>

09:12.301 --> 09:14.971
<i>Yeah. Here I am trying</i>
<i>to emerge myself more into real estate,</i>

09:15.054 --> 09:18.057
<i>but then I get the, "You're not home.</i>
<i>All you do is show houses."</i>

09:18.140 --> 09:20.560
<i>And now Michael's</i>
<i>back and forth on the road as well,</i>

09:20.643 --> 09:22.770
<i>and I don't have</i>
<i>too many people for Jordan.</i>

09:22.853 --> 09:25.982

<i>-Oh my God… Yes, it is!</i>

18:25.729 --> 18:28.315
<i>I love what you guys are doing!</i>

18:29.191 --> 18:30.818
<i>What else do you have to do?</i>

18:30.901 --> 18:32.903
<i>Well, we have upstairs</i>
<i>and a couple more things.</i>

18:32.986 --> 18:35.447
<i>[sighs] All right,</i>
<i>let's go upstairs and check it out.</i>

18:35.531 --> 18:37.950

18:39.243 --> 18:40.452
<i>Are these staying?</i>

18:40.536 --> 18:41.370
<i>-[man] Jillian?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

18:41.453 --> 18:44.248
<i>-How do you feel about those pillows?</i>
<i>-Let's just reverse the order.</i>

18:44.331 --> 18:47.584
<i>-We'll put the white behind.</i>
<i>-[Karla] What else is there?</i>

18:47.668 --> 18:52.422
<i>I have so much pressure right now,</i>
<i>because everything has to be perfect.</i>

18:52.506 --> 18:54.800
<i>Everything A-one, from top to bottom.</i>

18:54.883 --> 18:58.679
<i>So I'm just making sure</i>

<i>♪ Absolutely ♪</i>

19:12.693 --> 19:15.279
<i>-All right, ladies.</i>
<i>-[Anne] Karla, give us a tour!</i>

19:15.362 --> 19:17.990
<i>-This is the owner's suite.</i>
<i>-[Anne] Yes!</i>

19:18.073 --> 19:20.784
<i>[Karla] We have</i>
<i>engineered hardwood floors.</i>

19:21.368 --> 19:22.578
<i>[Anne] Nice, big closet!</i>

19:23.245 --> 19:25.497
<i>[Karla] Floor-to-ceiling porcelain tile.</i>

19:25.581 --> 19:27.749
<i>This is beautiful. I love it.</i>

19:27.833 --> 19:31.253
<i>[Anne] I love it! I love that</i>
<i>the tub is inside the shower,</i>

19:31.336 --> 19:33.547

19:33.630 --> 19:35.299
<i>It's super sexy!</i>

19:35.382 --> 19:37.801
<i>Same hardwood floors</i>
<i>in all of your bedrooms!</i>

19:37.885 --> 19:40.429
<i>Nice! Okay, the rooms are spacious!</i>

19:40.512 --> 19:42.181
<i>[Anne] I love that. I love that.</i>

19:42.764 --> 19:44.558
<i>All right, Alexis, what's the flooring?</i>

19:44.641 --> 19:46.101
<i>This is engineered hardwood.</i>

19:46.185 --> 19:48.937
<i>-Yes, girl. Ooh.</i>
<i>-Wait, wait, wait! And porcelain tile.</i>

19:49.021 --> 19:50.814
<i>Yes, girl, yes!</i>

19:50.898 --> 19:54.026
<i>-How many car spaces in the garage?</i>
<i>-Two. I hope.</i>

19:54.109 --> 19:56.361
<i>-Three.</i>
<i>-[Alexis] Right? Three!</i>

20:19.343 --> 20:20.510
<i>[Sharelle] All right, ladies!</i>

20:20.594 --> 20:22.971
<i>When y'all come down,</i>
<i>you gotta say one thing about the house.</i>

20:23.055 --> 20:25.307
<i>-Engineered hardwood floors!</i>
<i>-[Juawana] Okay!</i>

20:25.390 --> 20:27.351
<i>[Rena] 3,204 square feet, heated.</i>

20:27.434 --> 20:28.685
<i>[all] Ooh!</i>

<i>-[Sharelle] Okay, hunty!</i>
<i>-[Juawana] Ooh, I like that one.</i>

20:40.239 --> 20:42.783
<i>[Sharelle] All right, ladies,</i>
<i>it look like y'all did your homework.</i>

20:42.866 --> 20:46.328
<i>You can get a drink outside, and let's</i>
<i>mix and mingle and get this house sold.</i>

20:46.411 --> 20:47.913
<i>-[Colony] Let's do it!</i>
<i>-The Allure way!</i>

20:47.996 --> 20:50.916
<i>[upbeat music playing]</i>

20:50.999 --> 20:53.502
<i>Ooh! We got the DJ, okay!</i>

20:54.086 --> 20:56.880
<i>-[Juawana] Welcome, hi!</i>
<i>-How are you?</i>

20:58.131 --> 20:59.883
<i>Hi! So nice to meet you.</i>

20:59.967 --> 21:01.093
<i>Good to see you!</i>

21:01.176 --> 21:02.552
<i>[Juawana] Thank you for coming.</i>

21:03.387 --> 21:07.307
<i>Ooh! Thank you!</i>
<i>Ooh, it's nice and heavy. Ooh!</i>

21:08.100 --> 21:09.768
<i>-[man] It's beautiful on the inside.</i>
<i>-It is.</i>

21:09.851 --> 21:10.727
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

21:10.811 --> 21:11.853
<i>It's good to see ya.</i>

21:11.937 --> 21:13.772
<i>[Tennille] Let me show you</i>
<i>the rest of the home.</i>

21:13.855 --> 21:15.691
<i>Let us know what y'all think!</i>

21:16.608 --> 21:20.570
<i>Four bedrooms, three and a half bath,</i>
<i>over 3,200 square feet.</i>

21:21.113 --> 21:24.116
<i>The cabinetry was all imported from Italy.</i>

21:24.741 --> 21:27.035
<i>[Rena] And you've got</i>
<i>the panel refrigerator over here.</i>

21:27.119 --> 21:30.163
<i>It gives you that modern look.</i>
<i> Everything is tucked away.</i>

21:30.247 --> 21:34.084
<i>And very minimalistic. It's like,</i>
<i>you don't see a lot, but you see enough.</i>

21:34.167 --> 21:36.545
<i>-1.2 million?</i>
<i>-[Colony] It's 1.4!</i>

21:36.628 --> 21:38.255
<i>[man] Can we negotiate 1.2?</i>

21:38.338 --> 21:40.007
<i>Everything is negotiable.</i>

21:40.090 --> 21:43.927
<i>So once we get some time,</i>
<i>let's get started on that.</i>

21:44.011 --> 21:44.845
<i>[Alexis] Okay.</i>

21:44.928 --> 21:47.264
<i>That's exactly how I am,</i>
<i>I'm, like, so observant.</i>

21:47.347 --> 21:50.100
<i>But, yeah, I need to ask you.</i>

21:50.183 --> 21:52.644
<i>So you know when we were at Main Course?</i>

21:52.728 --> 21:55.689
<i>You and Anne,</i>
<i>it sounded like something was going on.</i>

21:55.772 --> 21:57.858
<i>It felt like you guys have tension.</i>

21:57.941 --> 21:59.693
<i>What's up? Is there something going on?</i>

21:59.776 --> 22:05.324
<i>No, girl, it's been something</i>
<i>that's kind of already happened,</i>

22:05.407 --> 22:06.783
<i>and I think that's lingering on.</i>

22:06.867 --> 22:12.914
<i>We did kind of get into a little bit</i>
<i>of a back-and-forth at Main Course, um…</i>

22:12.998 --> 22:16.585
<i>we already had</i>
<i>some type of energy that was off, because…</i>

22:16.668 --> 22:19.212
<i>I don't know if you know this,</i>
<i>but I'm just gonna say it.</i>

22:19.796 --> 22:24.343
<i>Rena was thinking about</i>
<i>starting a new brokerage.</i>

22:24.843 --> 22:25.677
<i>Oh.</i>

22:27.220 --> 22:29.765
<i>And she asked me and Anne to come.</i>

22:30.974 --> 22:34.144
<i>And for me,</i>
<i>I was like, "Hell no, off-brand."</i>

22:34.227 --> 22:36.355
<i>"I think that's</i>
<i>very disloyal to Sharelle."</i>

22:36.438 --> 22:38.190
<i>-It is.</i>
<i>-"I think that's absolutely crazy."</i>

22:38.857 --> 22:42.152
<i>Anne, on the other hand, was cool with it.</i>

22:43.278 --> 22:46.531
<i>So then I'm like, "Damn, sis,</i>
<i>I'm looking at you a little different."</i>

22:46.615 --> 22:49.076
<i>She would go with Rena?</i>

22:49.159 --> 22:50.827
<i>That's what she said.</i>

22:50.911 --> 22:52.996
<i>-Does Sharelle know about this?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

22:53.080 --> 22:54.456
<i>Sharelle knows?</i>

22:54.539 --> 22:56.333
<i>Damn!</i>

23:01.380 --> 23:04.049
<i>-[Rena] It's okay.</i>
<i>-I'm sorry to interrupt you, Rena.</i>

23:04.132 --> 23:06.843
<i>-Can I speak with you?</i>
<i>-Absolutely. I'll be right back.</i>

23:07.469 --> 23:12.057
<i>Y'all have any questions, these ladies</i>
<i>know the home very well. [chuckling]</i>

23:16.436 --> 23:18.772
<i>-Um, I did pull Anne and Colony aside…</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

23:18.855 --> 23:22.943
<i>…um, after we spoke in Miami,</i>
<i>and I asked them their side of the story.</i>

23:23.527 --> 23:25.946
<i>How they portrayed it was like you were</i>

23:26.029 --> 23:30.659
<i>trying to rear them to come if you would</i>
<i>decide to open up a brokerage.</i>

23:31.701 --> 23:33.912
<i>I mean, I did tell you</i>
<i>that I talked to them,</i>

23:33.995 --> 23:37.249
<i>and I didn't tell you everything that</i>
<i>we discussed because we were at dinner.</i>

23:37.332 --> 23:41.586
<i>We're in Miami, I didn't want</i>
<i>a repeat of the sushi dinner. [laughing]</i>

23:41.670 --> 23:43.964
<i>So I just wanted you to know</i>
<i>that I had talked to them,</i>

23:44.047 --> 23:45.507
<i>and I told you, I confided in them,</i>

23:45.590 --> 23:48.009
<i>and told them that I had</i>
<i>been thinking about, you know,</i>

23:48.093 --> 23:50.303
<i>there was an option</i>
<i>that I could start my own brokerage</i>

23:50.387 --> 23:52.139
<i>if we couldn't work things out between us.</i>

23:53.598 --> 23:55.684
<i>It's just some tension</i>
<i>that needs to be addressed.</i>

23:55.767 --> 23:58.603
<i>Both of you need to sit down.</i>
<i>Try to find some time.</i>

23:58.687 --> 24:01.481
<i>We will, 'cause me and her never argue,</i>

24:01.565 --> 24:04.568
<i>so when that happened, it was like…</i>

24:04.651 --> 24:07.028
<i>-I never thought you guys argue.</i>
<i>-I know, I hate it.</i>

24:07.737 --> 24:09.865
<i>But if we gotta address it,</i>

24:09.948 --> 24:11.825
<i>-we have to address it.</i>
<i>-It must be addressed.</i>

24:11.908 --> 24:13.702
<i>Do I really make you that uncomfortable</i>

24:13.785 --> 24:17.497
<i>where you don't want to work</i>
<i>with me and Allure? Like, what is it?</i>

24:17.581 --> 24:19.207
<i>It's not personal, Sharelle.</i>

24:19.875 --> 24:22.294
<i>When you change my pay,</i>
<i>you don't come and sit me down, like,</i>

24:22.377 --> 24:24.296
<i>"I'm going to change your pay, Rena."</i>

24:24.379 --> 24:27.841
<i>Like, you just announce it, like,</i>
<i>you just announce it to everybody,</i>

24:27.924 --> 24:30.385
<i>and then to say,</i>
<i>"If you don't like it, you can leave…"</i>

24:30.469 --> 24:33.054
<i>How am I supposed to take that</i>
<i>when you say that?</i>

24:33.138 --> 24:37.434
<i>Well, I would rather you leave than go</i>
<i>behind my back and talk to my agents</i>

24:37.517 --> 24:38.685
<i>and throw baits out there.</i>

24:38.768 --> 24:42.606
<i>I mean, from the outside looking in, Rena,</i>
<i>it looked like you were basically…</i>

24:42.689 --> 24:43.607
<i>you're plotting.</i>

24:44.983 --> 24:46.902
<i>Woman to woman, I want to pull you aside.</i>

24:46.985 --> 24:49.946
<i>If it's not a good environment</i>
<i>for you, let me know.</i>

24:50.030 --> 24:51.781
<i>Tell me what it is I can change.</i>

24:51.865 --> 24:56.620
<i>If it's something that we both can't</i>
<i>agree upon, then I'll give you the floor.</i>

24:56.703 --> 24:59.706
<i>Like, I support you, ten times full…</i>

24:59.789 --> 25:02.042
<i>-I appreciate that.</i>
<i>-…but I just want the respect.</i>

25:02.125 --> 25:05.045
<i>I appreciate that.</i>
<i>I mean, I feel the same way.</i>

25:05.128 --> 25:07.547
<i>I feel like I want respect too,</i>

25:07.631 --> 25:11.551
<i>in terms of, you know, having been here</i>
<i>from the ground up with you.</i>

25:11.635 --> 25:14.554
<i>And, um, I apologize that you feel</i>

25:14.638 --> 25:17.849
<i>like I was trying to go behind your back</i>
<i>and steal your agents.</i>

25:17.933 --> 25:21.436
<i>That's not my intent.</i>
<i>I really wasn't looking to hurt you.</i>

25:21.520 --> 25:23.605
<i>I don't want to hurt you,</i>
<i>hurt your business…</i>

25:23.688 --> 25:27.776
<i>I 100%… 210% support you</i>
<i>in what you're doing,</i>

25:27.859 --> 25:31.404
<i>which is why I'm here. Because you know</i>
<i>I don't like the commission split.</i>

25:31.488 --> 25:34.950
<i>I get what you're saying, and I could</i>
<i>be better at my words sometimes.</i>

25:35.033 --> 25:36.952
<i>I just want us to be on the same page.</i>

25:37.035 --> 25:40.497
<i>And if you leave, we leave</i>
<i>on a good note, not anything shady.</i>

25:40.580 --> 25:43.166
<i>That's the only note</i>
<i>I'd like to leave on, to be honest.</i>

25:43.750 --> 25:47.837
<i>I'm glad that Sharelle and I have been</i>
<i>able to kind of come to an understanding,</i>

25:47.921 --> 25:51.299
<i>but just because</i>
<i>we're getting back on good terms,</i>

25:51.383 --> 25:53.927
<i>that doesn't mean</i>
<i>that my goals have changed.</i>

25:54.010 --> 25:56.096
<i>I'm definitely gonna keep my options open.</i>

25:56.179 --> 26:00.600
<i>I was like, "I need to talk to her."</i>
<i>It was driving me crazy. I was pissed.</i>

26:00.684 --> 26:03.520
<i>-[Rena] I hear you.</i>
<i>-I can get over it. Let's sell this house.</i>

26:03.603 --> 26:05.021
<i>[Rena laughing]</i>

26:05.105 --> 26:06.356
<i>[Colony] Your guest is here yet?</i>

26:06.439 --> 26:09.109
<i>[Karla] They just text me and said</i>
<i>they're not going to make it.</i>

26:09.192 --> 26:12.612
<i>-I know Sharelle's gonna be upset.</i>
<i>-Girl, just work the room.</i>

26:12.696 --> 26:13.947
<i>But it's okay.</i>

26:14.030 --> 26:16.283
<i>It just has a nice, sleek,</i>
<i>modern look to it.</i>

26:16.366 --> 26:19.494
<i>[Rena] So the garage entrance over here.</i>
<i>There's a office over there.</i>

26:19.578 --> 26:20.412
<i>I can show you.</i>

26:20.495 --> 26:23.832
<i>So you have to put</i>
<i>shelves and stuff in here.</i>

26:23.915 --> 26:25.750
<i>-The builder made it--</i>
<i>-Customize it.</i>

26:25.834 --> 26:28.712
<i>Right, he made it open</i>
<i>so you can do whatever you choose.</i>

26:28.795 --> 26:30.964
<i>[Karla] I'm really loving this turnout.</i>

26:31.047 --> 26:32.382
<i>It's looking amazing.</i>

26:32.465 --> 26:35.552
<i>To know that the girls came together,</i>
<i>they brought me the clients…</i>

26:35.635 --> 26:38.930
<i>I mean, everything just</i>
<i>came out spectacular.</i>

26:39.014 --> 26:43.560
<i>I'm just hoping how everything went today</i>
<i>is enough to save my ass,</i>

26:43.643 --> 26:45.562
<i>at least until next week or something.</i>

26:47.105 --> 26:48.732
<i>Italian imported.</i>

26:48.815 --> 26:50.900
<i>-That's what 1.4 buys you.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

26:50.984 --> 26:53.737
<i>-I can see you here, Chris.</i>
<i>-Oh, I can see me here too.</i>

26:53.820 --> 26:55.071
<i>I can definitely see you here.</i>

26:55.155 --> 26:56.948
<i>[Colony] Sharelle's been on Karla's back,</i>

26:57.032 --> 27:00.327
<i>so I brought several of my clients</i>
<i>to this Arturo open house.</i>

27:00.410 --> 27:03.121
<i>So I'm going to let Karla show them around</i>

27:03.204 --> 27:04.789
<i>and at least let her look busy,</i>

27:04.873 --> 27:08.084
<i>so maybe Sharelle can see</i>
<i>that she's actually working and trying.</i>

27:08.168 --> 27:10.920
<i>[Sharelle] Your client's</i>
<i>thinking about making an offer.</i>

27:11.004 --> 27:16.259
<i>I heard! He knows where to come to</i>
<i>for the offer. He's going to Karla!</i>

27:16.343 --> 27:17.719
<i>-[laughing]</i>
<i>-[Sharelle] Ooh.</i>

27:17.802 --> 27:21.640
<i>This Arturo open house</i>
<i>went better than I expected.</i>

27:21.723 --> 27:24.017
<i>Karla showed up and showed out.</i>

27:24.100 --> 27:26.561
<i>We may get a couple of offers!</i>
<i>I'm proud of her.</i>
