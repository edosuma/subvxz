             Didn't you say $5? 

06:55.482 --> 06:58.716
Well, let's wait and see        
if the game is any good, huh?   

07:00.152 --> 07:02.286
Hey, this game                  
is next Sunday.                 

07:02.288 --> 07:05.689
Next Sunday?                    
Oh, no, Archie, you can't go!   

07:05.691 --> 07:07.492
            Why not?            

07:07.494 --> 07:12.730
Next Sunday is our              
25th anniversary, remember?     

07:12.732 --> 07:15.299
                Oh, yeah,       
                  yeah, yeah.   

07:15.301 --> 07:17.801
     Oh, jeez, I'm sorry, Edith,
        I forgot all about it.  

07:17.803 --> 07:19.603
      Don't worry, don't worry. 
    I'll make good. Don't worry.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.771
Hey, Lionel, come here.         

07:20.773 --> 07:22.973
You see the way this is,        
I'm in a corner here.           

07:22.975 --> 07:24.142
You know, 25th anniversary,     

07:24.144 --> 07:27.345
that's one of the biggies.      

07:27.347 --> 07:28.946
I don't feel I can              
leave Edith alone.              

07:28.948 --> 07:30.314
You understand                  
what I mean?                    

07:30.316 --> 07:32.716
     I know what you mean.      
You want me to sell the ticket. 

07:32.718 --> 07:34.718
No! I want you to get           
another ticket for Edith.       

07:38.123 --> 07:39.890
        Archie, I don't         
        wanna go.               

07:39.892 --> 07:41.992
                 You're going!  

07:41.994 --> 07:43.561
            No. It's impossible,
                 Mr. Bunker.    

07:43.563 --> 07:46.697
     There's not another ticket 
around. They're all sold out.   

07:46.699 --> 07:50.034
         Then I gotta           
         go by myself.          

07:50.036 --> 07:52.503
Well, you heard me trying there,
    didn't you, with Lionel?    

07:52.505 --> 07:54.972
         Here, Lionel,          
    thanks very much.           

07:54.974 --> 07:57.108
Thanks for all you've           
done for me, really.            

07:57.110 --> 07:58.676
             That's all right,  
                Mr. Bunker.     

07:58.678 --> 08:00.511
      Hey, listen, is it really 
        your 25th anniversary?  

08:00.513 --> 08:01.845
Twenty-fifth, Lionel.           

08:01.847 --> 08:03.681
          You know this 2 bucks 
            you gave me?        

08:03.683 --> 08:05.083
    Yeah?                       

08:05.085 --> 08:07.552
                    Buy yourself
                     something. 

08:15.894 --> 08:18.596
 What does he expect me to buy  
         with 2 bucks?          

08:20.065 --> 08:23.000
Archie, please                  
don't go to the game.           

08:23.002 --> 08:26.137
I was planning for us           
to be together.                 

08:26.139 --> 08:29.307
        We're gonna be together,
         Edith, after the game. 

08:29.309 --> 08:30.908
            I'll come home,     
              I'll pick you up, 

08:30.910 --> 08:32.510
        I'll maybe take you out 
              for a pizza,      

08:32.511 --> 08:33.876
                 a glass of wine
                  or something. 

08:33.879 --> 08:36.746
But it's                        
our anniversary!                

08:36.749 --> 08:38.716
                I know it's     
                our anniversary.

08:38.717 --> 08:41.419
      Our anniversary. That's   
     a fifty-fifty proposition. 

08:41.421 --> 08:44.388
        What do you wanna do,   
            spoil my half?      

08:44.390 --> 08:46.690
I think you'd better            
tell him the surprise now.      

08:46.692 --> 08:48.058
      Oh, yeah.                 

08:48.060 --> 08:52.763
I wanted to keep it a secret    
till next week, Archie.         

08:52.765 --> 08:57.768
Does room 822                   
mean anything to you?           

08:59.538 --> 09:01.772
                 It's a TV show,
                    ain't it?   

09:03.008 --> 09:04.742
     No!                        

09:04.744 --> 09:08.613
Don't you remember              
the Hotel Atlantic City?        

09:08.615 --> 09:14.318
                    Oh, yeah.   
                 What a fleabag.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.588
No, Archie.                     
It was lovely.                  

09:17.590 --> 09:20.024
That's where we spent           
our honeymoon.                  

09:20.026 --> 09:21.292
                        Ah.     
    Remember?                   

09:21.294 --> 09:25.530
And I've reserved the same room 
for next weekend.               

09:25.532 --> 09:27.898
We're going on                  
our second honeymoon.           

09:27.900 --> 09:30.334
                     Oh, no,    
                 we ain't, Edie.

09:30.336 --> 09:33.003
         You reserved that room,
          you just unreserve it.

09:33.005 --> 09:35.573
            I got money invested
            in this ticket.     

09:35.575 --> 09:37.275
    What, Arch, $7.50?          

09:37.277 --> 09:39.777
Ma, how much is that hotel      
    reservation gonna cost?     

09:39.779 --> 09:42.813
Sixty-two dollars.              

09:42.815 --> 09:45.449
              Sixty-two dollars?

09:45.451 --> 09:47.451
              Where did you get 
             that kind of money?

09:47.453 --> 09:52.156
I saved a little bit every week 
from the house money.           

09:52.158 --> 09:53.491
                Oh, well, Edith,
                I'm sorry.      

09:53.493 --> 09:55.193
    You just better go          
      get that money back.      

09:55.195 --> 09:56.794
                Oh, but, Archie,
                    I can't.    

09:56.796 --> 09:59.930
          It's what they call   
    a guaranteed reservation.   

09:59.932 --> 10:02.533
But you can get that money back 
      on that ticket easy.      

10:02.535 --> 10:03.934
Sure I can,                     
because the whole world         

10:03.936 --> 10:05.469
wants to go                     
to the basketball game.         

10:05.471 --> 10:09.039
Who the hell wants to           
go to that rotten hotel?        

10:09.041 --> 10:10.708
 Arch, that's the whole point.  

10:10.710 --> 10:13.678
 You got a ticket worth $7.50   
 that you can easily get back,  

10:13.680 --> 10:16.146
  but you've got $62 invested   
    in the hotel reservation    

10:16.148 --> 10:17.848
    that you can't get back.    

10:17.850 --> 10:20.651
Well, I'll show you             
the kind of man I am.           

10:20.653 --> 10:24.188
I'll take the loss              
and go to the game.             

10:24.190 --> 10:26.490
                 Oh, no, Archie.

10:26.492 --> 10:29.960
    You can take your loss,     
    but I ain't gonna take mine.

10:29.962 --> 10:33.464
             You can go to      
      a basketball game any day,

10:33.466 --> 10:37.702
    but your 25th anniversary   
    comes once in a lifetime.

        Notice all the high-tone
             coloreds here?     

13:48.961 --> 13:52.129
      That's what it takes      
          for service.          

13:52.131 --> 13:55.132
     You know, that's what      
     killed the railroads.      

13:57.602 --> 14:01.772
    They run out of all them    
      high-tone coloreds.       

14:01.774 --> 14:05.943
And after that, you couldn't    
get a decent pancake no more.   

14:05.945 --> 14:11.482

    we're high-tone whites.

Being as here is where          
we was headed, Edith.

older people like you.

15:18.584 --> 15:23.353

  of my sexual attractiveness.

in <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine.

         you read, huh?

    on our first honeymoon?     

15:53.985 --> 15:57.421

Like the light switch?          

16:05.263 --> 16:07.264

16:07.266 --> 16:10.734
          We sat by the window  
    and listened to the ocean   

16:10.736 --> 16:15.639
 and talked about our future and
 all the things we was gonna do.

all them things, Edith.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.647
          Well, if we done them,
          then they're memories,

16:23.649 --> 16:26.516
          and they're even nicer
              to talk about.    

16:26.518 --> 16:28.786

                  with me.      

16:28.788 --> 16:30.721
      Don't push me around      
         like a broom!          

16:30.723 --> 16:32.422
Ooh!                            

16:32.424 --> 16:35.358

Well, I hope you can            
remember something.             

17:00.352 --> 17:02.753
I can't think of nothing.       

17:02.755 --> 17:06.089
          I was just remembering

17:06.092 --> 17:11.694

      we was alone together     

17:11.696 --> 17:13.830

17:13.833 --> 17:16.634
Well, it's only                 
natural, Edie.

because of me.

      a terrible upset stomach. 

17:44.429 --> 17:46.363
Well I always get               
an upset stomach                

17:46.365 --> 17:48.165
when I take a bus to Jersey.

17:58.243 --> 18:01.411

                with me?        

18:02.981 --> 18:07.017
Well, certainly I've been happy 
with you, Edith. Jeez.          

18:09.988 --> 18:14.391
Of course, it took              
a little getting used to.       

18:15.994 --> 18:18.595
I had to tell you a lot of      
little things, you remember?    

18:18.597 --> 18:20.998
            Oh, yeah. I know.

Like, for instance, not to shake
a beer can like tomato juice.

In the first three days         
of our marriage,

I was drenched                  
to the waist.

or nothing?

but nobody's perfect.

    kind of a quick temper.

        and a good father.

              had the measles   

19:33.505 --> 19:35.839
  and she had that high fever?  

19:35.841 --> 19:39.576
    You came home and sat up    
    with her all night long.    

19:39.578 --> 19:42.179

    You know, you look          
 kind of pretty standing there. 

22:44.762 --> 22:46.830
     Is that the same dress     
        you was wearing         

22:46.832 --> 22:49.699
     when I first seen you      
come through that bathroom door?

22:49.701 --> 22:54.338
Oh, no, Archie, I just got this 
    at Bloomingdale's.          

22:54.340 --> 22:57.441
    Gee, that's funny.          

22:57.443 --> 23:01.111
You look just like you did      
         25 years ago.          

23:01.113 --> 23:04.514
    Thank you, Archie!          

23:05.916 --> 23:07.784
    Come on. Come on!           

23:07.786 --> 23:09.987
Let's kill this bottle          
of champagne, hey?              

23:09.989 --> 23:11.388
Uh-huh.                         
                        Wait!   

23:11.390 --> 23:13.957
                    I'm going to
                make a toast.   

23:13.959 --> 23:20.430
    Thank you for a wonderful   
            25 years.           

23:20.432 --> 23:23.633
Wow, Edith.                     
Thank you too.                  

23:23.635 --> 23:26.936
After all, I couldn't have      
did it without you.             

23:32.377 --> 23:33.977
                         [BURPS]

23:33.979 --> 23:37.747
Come on!                        
Give me that. Uh-uh.            

23:37.749 --> 23:40.583
Ahh.                            

23:40.585 --> 23:43.020
        Well, Edith.            

23:43.022 --> 23:45.288
              Well, what?       

23:49.260 --> 23:51.528
    Well, this.                 

24:04.008 --> 24:06.609
  Edith, come on, I've pushed   
  the button for the elevator.  

24:06.611 --> 24:08.111
Yeah, I'm ready.                

24:08.113 --> 24:10.514
    We've got 10 minutes for the
    bus. We're going to be late.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.082
                Can I help you  
             with anything, sir?

24:12.084 --> 24:14.784
 Oh, that's all right, Albert.  
    I think I can handle it.    

24:14.786 --> 24:18.121
             Oh, I'll handle it.
             It's checkout time.

24:22.626 --> 24:24.794
          I knew this was going 
            to cost me, Edith.  

24:24.796 --> 24:30.467
Look, all I got is paper.       
  Have you got three quarters?  

24:30.469 --> 24:33.070
                  Hurry up.     

24:50.654 --> 24:53.490
             [♪]                

24:53.492 --> 24:57.494
