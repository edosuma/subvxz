00:17.640 --> 00:20.880


00:20.960 --> 00:24.200


00:39.480 --> 00:40.920
-Lucy!

00:43.000 --> 00:43.920
Get help!

00:44.000 --> 00:46.040
-Are you all right?
-Call an ambulance!

00:47.440 --> 00:50.880
-Get some help, please!
-Understudy for Josephine. Where are you?

00:50.960 --> 00:52.240
Right here, sir.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.560
Rerig the ropes.

00:58.640 --> 00:59.800
Nice to meet you.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.920
Pleasure's entirely mine.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.720
Awful about Lucy.

01:06.440 --> 01:07.280
Is it, though?

01:15.360 --> 01:17.640
Do you know
when your mummy will be home, darling?

01:19.200 --> 01:20.520
Get the hell out of my room!

01:20.600 --> 01:22.000
Do you want to take this?

01:22.080 --> 01:24.400
Where we're going tends to get
a little nippy at this hour.

01:32.320 --> 01:36.480


01:36.560 --> 01:41.360


01:41.440 --> 01:47.120


01:47.200 --> 01:51.040


01:51.120 --> 01:54.280


01:54.360 --> 01:56.320


01:56.400 --> 01:58.600


01:59.200 --> 02:01.200


02:01.280 --> 02:02.760


02:02.840 --> 02:07.160


02:08.320 --> 02:11.160
When did you first suspect
something wasn't quite right?

02:11.680 --> 02:15.280
When I called Harry
and this supposed secretary picked up.

02:17.280 --> 02:20.800
And so after this secretary
answers Harry's phone,

02:21.760 --> 02:23.320
you hang up on her, right?

02:24.160 --> 02:25.880
Yeah. It was weird.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.520
That's why I left you the voice mail.

02:30.440 --> 02:34.200
So you dropped him off at his office
shortly before 12 noon.

02:34.280 --> 02:37.240
You called my phone at 5:45 p.m.

02:37.760 --> 02:38.640
Yeah, that's right.

02:38.720 --> 02:42.960
Forensics put Harry's time of death
somewhere between 12:00 and 6:00 p.m.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.840
So whoever…

02:52.760 --> 02:53.960
whoever did this,

02:55.520 --> 02:58.520
they could have been there
before I dropped him off?

03:08.760 --> 03:12.320
You don't think
that… that I… killed Harry?

03:12.400 --> 03:13.240
No, I don't.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.320
But I do need to rule you out.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.480
Do I need a lawyer?

03:21.320 --> 03:22.760
You're not under arrest.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.320
After you got there, did you notice
anything suspicious in the area?

03:28.400 --> 03:29.600
Anything at all?

03:32.360 --> 03:33.440
I'll try and be good.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.440
I promise.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.800
After I dropped him, there was a woman.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.160
And a man.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.200
Young.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.200
I didn't think anything of it.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.000
Can you remember what they look like?

03:52.600 --> 03:55.200
-Yeah.
-How well?

03:56.560 --> 03:57.680
Well enough.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.840
She's gettin' married.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.240
Right.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.080
Sorry.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.080
-So you didn't shag her?

04:09.160 --> 04:10.240
Nah.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.640
Kissed her, but she… pulled away.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.080
-Oof.
-Yeah. Big oof.

04:18.800 --> 04:23.880
It's bizarre, though, because her fiancé
is the father of her kids,

04:23.960 --> 04:27.080
and th… they're, like, not baby kids.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.200
They're… they're teenagers.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.320
How come they're only just marrying now?

04:32.840 --> 04:34.760
Probably had kids quickly,

04:35.360 --> 04:40.040
and then marriage just seemed irrelevant
in the swirl of day-to-day life.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.800
And now, in some middle-aged gesture

04:42.880 --> 04:46.160
of belated romance,
he's gone and proposed,

04:46.240 --> 04:49.240
and she's thought, "Fuck it.
Why not? Any excuse for a party."

04:50.200 --> 04:52.880
-I looked him up.
-Of course you did.

04:53.400 --> 04:57.080
-Just… out of curiosity.
-And?

04:57.160 --> 04:58.360
Bang average.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.440
His name's Dave.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.960
And trust me, he is definitely a Dave.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.320
Bang average?

05:09.840 --> 05:10.800
This guy's hot.

05:11.480 --> 05:12.440
Dave or no Dave.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.280
Look at this.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.280
Not-bang-average Dave
got into a fight on a night out.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.160
Claimed it was self-defense.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.480
Don't you think it's a bit strange?

05:26.040 --> 05:27.640
Cassie reappears, and then…

05:29.640 --> 05:30.480
Guy,

05:31.080 --> 05:31.960
Harry,

05:32.920 --> 05:36.600
all these people suddenly start… getting…

05:36.680 --> 05:39.000
…dead.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.640
This guy's got anger issues.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.240
You wanna know what I think?

05:48.560 --> 05:49.840
I think you're crazy.

05:49.920 --> 05:50.760
Yeah.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.000
Maybe.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.720
This is starting to feel
like a hostage situation!

06:09.800 --> 06:11.480
-Nearly there.
-Okay…

06:11.560 --> 06:12.640
Here we go.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.200
And now!

06:20.280 --> 06:21.480


06:21.560 --> 06:24.000
We love you, Dave!

06:26.520 --> 06:28.200
Oh my…

06:28.280 --> 06:31.640
-Can I put the blindfold back on?
-Here you are, my darling!

06:31.720 --> 06:34.040
-Chug it!
-Oh, yes!

06:34.120 --> 06:37.400
Chug it!
Chug it! Chug it! Chug it! Chug it!

06:39.880 --> 06:40.720
Yes!

06:41.600 --> 06:45.560
Welcome! Welcome to your stag weekend,
my friend.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.880
This should've happened years ago,

06:47.960 --> 06:51.000
but don't let the fact that
she turned you down 100 times ruin it.

06:51.080 --> 06:53.000
-We got there eventually!

06:53.080 --> 06:55.400
Trust me, we're gonna make this
worth the wait!

06:55.480 --> 06:59.120
-Oh, yeah!

06:59.680 --> 07:00.760
Let's do it.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.400
…I've spoken to you…

07:06.680 --> 07:08.000
-After you.
-Right.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.400
Amazing.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.000
Great work.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.200
-You've got quite the talent here.
-Yeah.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.920
If it wasn't for the hair,
I'd wonder if she were really mine.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.800
I've no doubt
she will qualify for the finals this year.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.760
There is just…
I'm sorry, it… it's a bit awkward.

08:10.840 --> 08:14.600
Full disclosure. The preparations
for the finals won't be cheap.

08:14.680 --> 08:18.400
There are scholarship opportunities,
but, uh, they're quite competitive.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.640
So just be prepared for that.

08:20.720 --> 08:21.880
Absolutely. Yeah.

08:22.400 --> 08:27.920
And, uh, I bring that up now because,
well, I noticed I'm owed 700 still,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.960
and… and the direct debit
got canceled, so…

08:32.000 --> 08:34.600
Oh. I'm so sorry. Uh…

08:34.680 --> 08:36.840
There must have been some kind of mistake.

08:36.920 --> 08:38.760
I'll get that to you immediately.

08:38.840 --> 08:42.480
I'm getting a hefty bonus on Saturday,
so it'll all be sorted then.

08:42.560 --> 08:44.200
Great. Great. Thank you.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.280
Yep, that's it. But with a fringe.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.040
Yeah, and tied back.

08:57.560 --> 09:00.480
-Yeah, that's it. Just like that.
-And the guy?

09:03.240 --> 09:04.080
Happy?

09:05.560 --> 09:08.520
-Yeah.
-Is this the start of an all-nighter?

09:08.600 --> 09:11.640
-What are you doing here so late?
-I needed my phone charger.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.520
My daughter keeps leaving 'em with my ex,

09:13.600 --> 09:17.080
so now she's got dozens of those
in addition to the house and the dog.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.520
Sorry.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.040
Who's this?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.440
She's a potential witness
in the Harry Sutton murder case.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.160
Right.

09:25.760 --> 09:31.000
And she saw these two outside his office
around the time of death.

09:32.120 --> 09:32.960
Excellent.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.040
Well, carry on.

09:37.040 --> 09:41.360
But, uh… get that to me
before we distribute to media. Okay?

09:42.600 --> 09:43.720
When it's finished.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.440
-Come on, come on, come on.

10:08.560 --> 10:09.520
What?

10:09.600 --> 10:12.840
Please tell me
you didn't kill Harry Sutton.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.080
Jesus Christ, what were you thinking?

10:17.160 --> 10:19.640
Wait, is your connection fuzzy?

10:19.720 --> 10:22.040
What? No. I can hear you.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.480
I really hope it is,
because I could have sworn

10:24.560 --> 10:25.880
I heard you speaking to me

10:25.960 --> 10:28.160
as though your input
is something I'll value.

10:28.240 --> 10:31.360
<i>We don't work for you.</i>
<i>We work for Del Flynn.</i>

10:31.440 --> 10:32.760
This has gone too far.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.880
I completely agree.
This conversation has gone too far.

10:35.960 --> 10:36.800
You listen to me--

10:36.880 --> 10:37.920
No, I don't think so.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.360
But before I go, I will allow you
to make up for your disrespectful tone.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.080
<i>We're going to send you</i>
<i>a photo of a woman right now.</i>

10:45.160 --> 10:47.640
<i>I want you to let me know</i>
<i>if you recognize her.</i>

11:13.320 --> 11:14.160
No.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.240
No, I don't.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.520
Her name is Megan Pierce.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.840
If you hear anything about her,
let us know immediately.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.800
Okay, gents. I think we seem
to have walked into the Valley of Youth.

11:38.880 --> 11:42.760
A tenner for anyone that can spot
anyone that was born in the last century.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.840
I think that girl's
in my daughter's hockey team. Mandem, bar.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.920
Oh, I'll find you. I need a piss.

12:16.040 --> 12:16.880
Ooh.

12:16.960 --> 12:20.560
Where did that come from?

12:21.680 --> 12:24.240
Oh! Sorry, mate.

12:24.320 --> 12:28.160
You are never drinking
anything carbonated ever again.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.960
We've all been there, mate.
No need to apologize.

12:33.240 --> 12:34.560
We know each other, don't we?

12:35.440 --> 12:38.200
-I don't think so. Do we?
-You from Ridgewood?

12:39.080 --> 12:39.920
No.

12:40.640 --> 12:43.600
I've got a friend who lives out there.
We go out from time to time.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.040
See, that could be it.

12:45.560 --> 12:48.800
Sorry, I'm a… I'm a bit pissed!

12:48.880 --> 12:51.800
God, I said that already, didn't I? Oh!

12:51.880 --> 12:53.240
God!

12:53.760 --> 12:56.320
Oh! It's my stag weekend.

12:56.400 --> 13:00.720
Whoa! I would say congratulations,
but you don't seem too pleased about it.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.600
Oh, look, mate, I'm super pleased
about the fiancée.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.160
Uh, you got any mints, by any chance?

13:07.240 --> 13:09.440
-Gum okay?
-Oh! You're a lifesaver.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.120
Thank you. All right. Have a good night.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.080
Take it easy.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.320
Hit me up, hit me up, man!

13:28.080 --> 13:29.800
Ah. Oh!

13:30.320 --> 13:32.480
Uh… They bought tequila!

13:32.560 --> 13:36.640
Lads, lads, lads!
This is a man I met in the bathroom!

13:36.720 --> 13:38.120
-Oh, no, no!

13:39.040 --> 13:41.200
You need to get this one
a bit more pissed.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.040
-Hey, join us.
-Come on.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.000
Cheers.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.640
Oh, fucking hell!

13:52.880 --> 13:54.400
Sit down! Let's go!

13:54.480 --> 13:57.000
Get this man a beer or something.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.440
I checked out that door
in Stewart Green's basement.

14:00.520 --> 14:01.640
And?

14:01.720 --> 14:03.200
Yeah, it was just a closet.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.320
With a yellow suitcase inside.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.680
Listen, can I tell you something, Cassie?

14:13.320 --> 14:16.280
Every year during Carnival, men disappear.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.560
-Like Stewart?
-Like Stewart. And since Stewart.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.160
Missing, presumed dead,
their loved ones going out of their mind,

14:24.240 --> 14:26.520
because year after year,
there are no answers.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.360
So you say
someone saw Stewart Green at Vipers,

14:30.440 --> 14:33.240
but you can't tell me who
because you promised not to.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.560
If I may be so bold, fuck your promise.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.080
If Stewart Green is still alive,
we need to know.

14:39.160 --> 14:42.720
Yours is not the only life
turned on its head. Men are dying.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.160
It was Lorraine.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.200
She's the one who saw Stewart at Vipers.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.760
I'll be in touch
as soon as I hear anything.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.560
Okay. See you.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.400
<i> Hey, this is Dave.</i>
<i>Can't get to the phone. Leave a message.</i>

15:33.960 --> 15:36.880
<i> Hi, this is Kayleigh's phone.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

15:45.800 --> 15:46.880
<i>Hi, Mummy.</i>

15:46.960 --> 15:48.480
Why are you still awake?

15:49.200 --> 15:51.000
-<i>How's the sleepover?</i>
-Good.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.320
<i> Great. Did… did Jordan</i>
<i>get off to his okay?</i>

15:53.400 --> 15:56.360
-<i>Think so</i>.
I love you. I'll see you tomorrow.

15:56.440 --> 15:57.280
<i>Bye.</i>

16:20.640 --> 16:22.400
Oh, Cassie.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.040
Are you still at Vipers?

16:24.640 --> 16:26.600
Yeah, why don't you come down?

16:26.680 --> 16:28.480
<i>We've having a memorial for Harry.</i>

16:28.560 --> 16:31.160
-<i> I've just been with Broome.</i>
-Okay.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.720
<i> I had to tell him</i>
<i>you were the one that saw Stewart.</i>

16:35.600 --> 16:38.040
<i> Plenty of things</i>
<i>to cry about today. That's not one.</i>

16:38.120 --> 16:39.680
<i>-Just come down.</i>
-Yeah.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.200
Okay.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.480
If only she'd said yes the first time,

16:48.560 --> 16:50.200
we'd be fitting in here
a whole lot better.

16:50.280 --> 16:51.400
What do you mean, first time?

16:51.480 --> 16:55.320
Dave's been trying to get his girl
to marry him for… How long has it been?

16:55.400 --> 16:56.760
I think we still used VHS.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.360
We… we have three kids.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.760
We're basically married
minus the married part.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.280
So she's never been married before?

17:04.360 --> 17:05.800
-No.
-Engaged?

17:06.600 --> 17:08.200
-No!
-You sure?

17:08.280 --> 17:10.160
I think I'm sure.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.720
Well, you never know with people.
That's what I've found.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.800
Secrets in closets
and all that.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.360
She's never been married or engaged.

17:20.960 --> 17:23.440
-Dave, why don't we, uh…
-Yeah, we should.

17:23.520 --> 17:28.800
Look, seriously,
what… changed her mind about you?

17:30.560 --> 17:33.840
What made her finally bite the bullet?

17:33.920 --> 17:35.800
Maybe it's my impeccable charm.

17:37.160 --> 17:40.000
Yeah, I'll bet she's
an impeccable charm kind of girl, Megan.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.040
What?

17:43.640 --> 17:44.760
-Hm?
-I'm sorry.

17:44.840 --> 17:47.560
-Do… do you know my fiancée?
-No!

17:47.640 --> 17:51.080
I just, uh… I just heard him say her name.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.800
All right, look,
I'm gonna call it a night.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.200
Congratulations, mate.

18:02.520 --> 18:03.360
Oi.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.120
All right, who are you?

18:06.200 --> 18:08.000
-How do you mean?
-Exactly as I say.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.160
Who are you, and what do you want?

18:10.240 --> 18:13.000
-I don't want anything. I just--
-Oh, bollocks.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.600
-What, you know Megan, is that it?
-Mate!

18:15.680 --> 18:19.360
Don't "mate" me. I'm here with my friends,
trying to have a good night.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.720
-And you come around--
-You invited me.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.880
How do you know her? 'Cause I asked,
and none of them said her name.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.120
You're pissed. Go on back inside.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.880
I'm gonna ask you again, man. Who are you?

18:30.960 --> 18:34.320
-I'm… no one.
-Oh, stop lying to me!

18:34.400 --> 18:36.240
-Do you know Megan?
-Do you?

18:36.320 --> 18:38.320
What the fuck does that mean? Huh?

18:38.400 --> 18:42.680
The woman you are marrying.
Do you know her? Because… you know what?

18:44.600 --> 18:46.000
I don't think you do.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.680
Oi. Oi!

19:00.440 --> 19:01.560
Oi, both of you!

19:04.360 --> 19:05.400
Stop them!

19:06.000 --> 19:07.240
Jeez!

19:13.360 --> 19:15.480
-No, no, no!

19:30.080 --> 19:31.000
Calm down.

20:00.480 --> 20:04.080
So glad you're here. Oh!

20:04.160 --> 20:07.040
-Come on. Let's do this. Yeah?
-Yeah.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.760
-I can't believe he's really gone.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.040
-Let's get some alcohol.

20:12.120 --> 20:15.040
I've gotta make a speech.
Everybody's come down for Harry.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.520
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

20:28.680 --> 20:30.280
Uh…

20:33.720 --> 20:36.840
To know Harry was to love Harry.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.920
He had his demons. Don't we all?

20:41.560 --> 20:42.480
He was, um…

20:43.440 --> 20:45.160
he was pure, in his way.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.360
He could see your purity
through your damage.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.480
Maybe even find it for you.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.400
Except you, Rudy.
You're a filthy twat, as he put it.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.280
He was
just one of those people.

20:59.080 --> 21:02.040
He never wanted you
to feel an ounce of sorrow.

21:02.120 --> 21:05.240
He took on the…
the heaviness of the world.

21:05.880 --> 21:09.120
He never let you slip
too far into despair…

21:09.200 --> 21:11.320
…always throwing you
a lifeline of a laugh.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.760
We all loved him.

21:14.760 --> 21:15.640
And he gave

21:16.560 --> 21:18.280
all of himself to everyone.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.320
And now he's gone.

21:26.440 --> 21:27.640
And I'm gonna miss…

21:27.720 --> 21:28.680
Sorry.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.320
I'm gonna miss him forever.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.880
This is for Harry.

21:57.080 --> 21:57.960
Great speech.

21:58.560 --> 21:59.400
Thank you.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.080
Speeches are easy
when they come from the heart.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.920
Look, I know you're mad at me.

22:09.840 --> 22:12.240
Why didn't I tell you
I saw Stewart Green, right?

22:13.120 --> 22:14.680
Sit down. Sit down.

22:20.160 --> 22:23.200
Right, I don't…
I don't want to play the cancer card,

22:23.280 --> 22:27.560
but I've got to be honest,
it was a really low priority.

22:27.640 --> 22:31.000
Even when it's a man missing,
presumed dead for 17 years?

22:31.600 --> 22:34.120
Yeah, I guess so. I wasn't thinking.

22:34.200 --> 22:37.320
But honestly, I will…
I will tell you whatever I know.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.640
Funerals really bring out
your romantic side.

23:01.320 --> 23:02.160
You loved him.

23:02.920 --> 23:03.760
I'm here.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.040
-I've got you.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.080
I need you to come with me.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.640
Please don't ask me why.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.960
Just get in the car.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.240
-See ya.
-Bye, darling.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.560
There's another thing
I need to ask you about.

24:16.640 --> 24:19.080
Why did you tell Ray Levine she was dead?

24:21.360 --> 24:23.440
I didn't want him to get any ideas.

24:24.240 --> 24:26.080
Cassie's moved on. She's got a new life.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.840
Yeah, but to say that she'd died?

24:28.880 --> 24:32.960
Why didn't you… I don't know,
say she'd moved to Canada?

24:33.040 --> 24:35.120
Canada? Who moves to Canada?

24:35.920 --> 24:38.640
Anyway, he'd have just gone to the airport
and got on the next flight.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.240
Did you not know him at all back then?

24:40.320 --> 24:44.800
Not well, no. I mean, just through
a few interviews after Cassie left.

24:44.880 --> 24:45.880
Oh, I did.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.400
He was around
the night that Cassie ran away.

24:49.480 --> 24:50.920
The night Stewart disappeared.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.120
-Ray was?
-Yeah, yeah.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.080
Yeah, he said
that he loved Cassie.

24:56.720 --> 24:59.200
And, you know, he probably did,
I don't know, but

25:00.480 --> 25:01.920
the way he was with her…

25:04.200 --> 25:05.880
it was more like an addiction.

25:48.800 --> 25:49.680
Kayleigh?

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
<i>Hi, this is Kayleigh's phone.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

26:43.120 --> 26:44.720
<i>Everything okay?</i>

26:44.800 --> 26:47.240
Bea, where's Kayleigh? Is she with you?

26:47.320 --> 26:52.320
No, she texted,
saying she wasn't feeling well.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.240
When?

26:54.280 --> 26:56.400
-When?
-Is everything okay?

26:56.480 --> 26:57.360
Bea, when?

26:57.920 --> 26:59.480
<i>Late, uh, 10:30.</i>

26:59.560 --> 27:01.840
-I'd expected her earlier.
-Shit!

27:07.240 --> 27:08.280
Come on.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.400
<i>Finally! Hello.</i>

27:27.480 --> 27:28.680
Took you a while.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.160
Where is she?

27:31.240 --> 27:32.120
<i>Hush.</i>

27:33.160 --> 27:36.160
<i>If you want your daughter back,</i>
<i>listen very carefully.</i>

27:37.600 --> 27:40.160
There's a track
off Rigby Road in Waldwick.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.720
You might wanna write this down.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.480
There, go down it,
and you'll come to an intersection.

27:45.040 --> 27:48.160
<i>-We'll be there, and we'll have a chat.</i>
What about Kayleigh?

27:48.240 --> 27:50.520
Let's see how our conversation goes.

27:51.640 --> 27:52.800
Oh, and do be quick.

27:53.520 --> 27:55.720
<i>We've been waiting for you all night.</i>

27:56.240 --> 27:57.080
Who are you?

27:57.800 --> 28:01.520
<i> Oh, and, Megan,</i>
<i>make sure you don't tell anyone.</i>

28:02.440 --> 28:05.840
It would be a shame to lose your lawyer
and your daughter in the same week.

28:05.920 --> 28:06.920
<i>See you soon.</i>

28:11.520 --> 28:12.560
God!

28:16.080 --> 28:17.360
Oh, come on!

28:17.440 --> 28:20.960
<i> This is the voice mail</i>
<i>of DS Michael Broome. Leave a message.</i>

29:18.040 --> 29:19.520
-Hi, Del!
-Hello, darling.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.720
-Hi.
-Bye, Jen.

29:48.840 --> 29:49.760
Hello, my love.

30:40.760 --> 30:44.360
Hi, Mr. Flynn. I'm so sorry to bother you.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.480
<i>Spit it out. Did you find Carlton?</i>

30:47.320 --> 30:48.880
No, it's not that.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.680
<i>-I… I'm sorry.</i>

30:51.480 --> 30:52.560
What is it, then?

30:53.880 --> 30:55.400
This ain't a good time.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.680
<i>I don't want to add</i>
<i>any additional stress.</i>

30:57.760 --> 31:00.280
I'm just really concerned
about that couple you hired.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.160
Profoundly concerned.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.680
They're killing people, Del.

31:05.440 --> 31:08.640
<i>I knew they weren't exactly kosher</i>
<i>in their extraction methods,</i>

31:08.720 --> 31:10.920
<i>but I'm in way over my head here, mate.</i>

31:11.000 --> 31:12.480
People? What people?

31:12.560 --> 31:15.200
<i> Did you hear about</i>
<i>that Livingstone lawyer? That was them.</i>

31:15.280 --> 31:16.840
<i>I gave them his name.</i>

31:16.920 --> 31:19.080
<i>I'm having</i>
<i>a bit of a breakdown here.</i>

31:19.160 --> 31:22.800
Now they're going after some woman.
Just a suburban mum type.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.560
It's gone too far.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.480
They were told to find Carlton.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.600
<i>Del, please.</i>

31:31.680 --> 31:33.600
This is out of control.

31:33.680 --> 31:36.960
Don't call me again
until you find Carlton.

31:44.520 --> 31:45.520
Come on, darling.

31:49.400 --> 31:52.640
It's no good talking to Marlene.
She's not his mum.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.880
Only his parents understand the real pain.

32:04.880 --> 32:07.160
But I promise you, Maria,

32:08.760 --> 32:10.120
I will find our son.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.600
Ray, what's going on?

32:47.880 --> 32:49.680
Wh… why are we here?

32:51.920 --> 32:53.280
I remembered something.

32:55.080 --> 32:56.160
Remembered what?

32:56.240 --> 32:59.760
This is where it happened.
That night, before I came to see you.

33:07.120 --> 33:07.960
I was here.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.200
<i>You have arrived</i>
<i>at your destination.</i>

35:45.480 --> 35:49.280
I'm not trying to leave!
Can I just come out for a wee?

35:49.880 --> 35:51.960
Oh! That's what the bucket's for.

36:36.560 --> 36:40.800
-Wait.

37:15.840 --> 37:16.760
Mum, stop!

37:53.160 --> 37:54.560
-Run!

38:16.120 --> 38:17.120
Come on, quickly!

38:43.920 --> 38:46.000
-Mum, he's hanging on!

39:07.920 --> 39:10.720
I thought I was gonna die.
I thought you were gonna die.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.480
Kayleigh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

39:12.560 --> 39:15.800
-Who were those fucking freaks?
-I don't know. I don't know.

39:15.880 --> 39:19.080
But we're going to the police now.
Right now, okay?

39:19.880 --> 39:22.160
You'll be safe.
I'll make sure you're safe.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.840
-Call Broome.
-<i>Calling Broome.</i>

39:32.480 --> 39:34.240
<i>-This is the voice mail of DS Broome.</i>

39:34.320 --> 39:36.200
<i>Please leave a message,</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

39:51.480 --> 39:53.120
Broome's not in right now, so…

39:53.200 --> 39:56.720
Those two people from the sketch,
they abducted my daughter.

39:58.040 --> 40:00.640
Okay, well, uh… I can take care of you.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.280
Come with me.

40:05.080 --> 40:05.920
It's okay.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.560
She was in my room.
They know where we live.

40:22.640 --> 40:25.640
Uh… We'll send people to your home.
Is anyone there now?

40:25.720 --> 40:27.680
Uh… Uh, no.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.840
Um, no, not until tomorrow.

40:37.360 --> 40:38.800
You're safe here, okay?

40:40.160 --> 40:42.120
You said the people
that kidnapped your daughter

40:42.200 --> 40:44.200
were the same you saw
outside Harry Sutton's office?

40:44.280 --> 40:45.680
Yes. Yeah, it was them.

40:46.560 --> 40:47.400
And the man,

40:48.520 --> 40:49.720
I think he might be dead.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.520
Uh, ju… just wait here.

40:54.600 --> 40:57.360
I'll track down Broome,
and I'll… I'll bring him to you.

41:13.120 --> 41:13.960
I have them.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.840
<i>Go around to the left</i>
<i>of the police station.</i>

41:16.920 --> 41:19.880
<i>I'll let you in the side entrance.</i>
<i>There's no CCTV there.</i>

41:28.280 --> 41:30.440
What did people like that want with you?

41:33.240 --> 41:35.800
-I don't know.
-Stop lying to me!

41:35.880 --> 41:38.960
You weren't just a dancer. You stripped.

41:40.480 --> 41:44.160
Is that what this is all about?
You should have told me the truth.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.160
The truth…

41:54.280 --> 41:55.440
This is the truth.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.920
When I was your age, Kayleigh,

42:00.320 --> 42:02.000
I didn't have the life you have.

42:02.080 --> 42:05.800
I was alone. I didn't have anybody
who supported me or loved me

42:05.880 --> 42:07.840
until I found that job at Vipers.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.200
And you're right.

42:12.760 --> 42:13.920
I was a dancer.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.040
And I was so happy doing it,

42:18.600 --> 42:20.320
because it was the first time…

42:22.720 --> 42:25.000
that anybody in my life told me
I was good at anything.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.480
But there was a customer,

42:30.280 --> 42:31.600
a really nasty guy,

42:32.920 --> 42:34.760
and he had this fixation on me.

42:37.280 --> 42:38.120
And, uh,

42:39.800 --> 42:41.480
I thought this man had died.

42:43.720 --> 42:45.080
But now he might be back.

42:46.120 --> 42:46.960
And…

42:47.760 --> 42:48.600
And what?

42:50.960 --> 42:55.160
And I wasn't lying.
I have no idea who those people are.

42:57.680 --> 42:59.240
Did we kill that guy, Mum?

43:00.720 --> 43:01.600
I don't know.

43:03.600 --> 43:04.600
But if he's dead,

43:05.840 --> 43:07.760
then I'm the one that kept driving.

43:09.440 --> 43:11.640
And I'd do it again to keep you safe.

43:17.600 --> 43:19.680
I'll get us something hot to drink.

43:41.760 --> 43:42.600
Where?

43:43.280 --> 43:44.120
This way.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.080
It's just through here, downstairs.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.920
<i>This has to stop.</i>
<i>I've put them somewhere safe.</i>

44:21.000 --> 44:22.280
That was a mistake.

44:23.920 --> 44:27.360
It's over. No more killing.
I never agreed to it.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.120
Whatever you say.

44:29.720 --> 44:31.040
I'm turning myself in.

44:36.240 --> 44:38.360
No! No! No!

44:38.440 --> 44:40.320
<i>Help!</i>
