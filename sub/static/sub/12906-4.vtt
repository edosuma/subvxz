<i>Previously</i>
<i>on "devious maids"...</i>
Oh, my god.

00:04.379 --> 00:05.511
Spence westmore,
you're under arrest.

00:05.513 --> 00:06.529
I'm shannon.
I'm peri's sister.

00:06.531 --> 00:07.714
You have to do something!

00:07.716 --> 00:09.265
You can't let that woman
raise my son!

00:09.267 --> 00:11.134
tucker, what's wrong?

00:11.136 --> 00:13.303
If his nanny
was someone he already knew,

00:13.305 --> 00:15.021
That would keep him calm.

00:15.023 --> 00:17.357
You'll have to go easy on her
now that she's working here.

00:17.359 --> 00:18.474
You okay with that?

00:18.476 --> 00:19.809
Keep your friends close.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.644
And your enemies
even closer.

00:21.646 --> 00:22.946
I'm leaving you.

00:22.948 --> 00:24.647
Evelyn, we were meant
to be together.

00:24.649 --> 00:27.066
Mrs. Powell, the credit card
we have for you has been...

00:27.068 --> 00:28.651
Declined.
Adrian.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.787
Do you really think you're
gonna win mrs. Powell back

00:30.789 --> 00:33.072
By -- by cutting off her money
and making her miserable?

00:33.074 --> 00:34.457
Isn't it romantic?

00:34.459 --> 00:35.992
I'm taking you up
on your offer.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.910
My offer?
I'm moving in.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.879
The big fashion exec
just bought this place.

00:39.881 --> 00:41.714
She's gonna be gone
for six months.

00:41.716 --> 00:43.967
This really cute guy came over
and assumed i owned the house,

00:43.969 --> 00:45.752
So i went with it.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.203
Kyle, is that you?

00:47.205 --> 00:49.589
You didn't mention
your mother was visiting.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.424
Oh, she's not visiting.
She lives here.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.643
I like her, too.
But not for you.

00:53.645 --> 00:55.511
I have other plans
for you, kyle.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.063
I think what you're doing
is shameful,

00:57.065 --> 00:58.314
Seeing
that woman's husband.

00:58.316 --> 00:59.732
Ex-husband.

00:59.734 --> 01:01.234
I'm not
breaking up with him.

01:01.236 --> 01:02.518
This means war.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.237
Uh, my scalp seems
to be tingling.

01:04.239 --> 01:05.738
Is that normal?

01:05.740 --> 01:08.157
To attack their hair?
You've crossed a line.

01:08.159 --> 01:10.576
I'm daniela!
Your cousin josefina's daughter?

01:10.578 --> 01:12.745
I want to be a singer,
just like you.

01:12.747 --> 01:14.330
That girl's your daughter?

01:14.332 --> 01:16.783
My cousin josefina --
she raised her as her own.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.501
So, she doesn't
even know she's adopted?

01:18.503 --> 01:20.787
It's the boys, the drugs.
You're crashing cars.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.538
Well, it's none
of your business what i do.

01:22.540 --> 01:23.706
You're not my mom.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.875
Yeah, josefina?
It's carmen.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.510
I think she needs you.

01:27.512 --> 01:29.412
I'll buy you a drink.
I'm all yours.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.566
Wow.

01:50.568 --> 01:51.901
that was...

01:51.903 --> 01:53.986
I know.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.955
Can i ask you something?

01:55.957 --> 01:57.290
Oh, god.

01:57.292 --> 01:59.325
You're not gonna ask me
to marry you, right?

01:59.327 --> 02:00.877
Why would you think that?

02:00.879 --> 02:02.462
It's happened to me before.

02:02.464 --> 02:04.464
Guys always propose
after sex.

02:04.466 --> 02:05.798
It's my curse.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.333
Actually,
i was gonna ask you,

02:07.335 --> 02:10.837
If it's okay with you,
if we keep this...

02:10.839 --> 02:11.921
Casual.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.006
Oh?

02:14.008 --> 02:16.225
I was in a relationship
last year,

02:16.227 --> 02:17.760
And  i am...

02:17.762 --> 02:20.012
I'm not ready to go down
that road again.

02:21.066 --> 02:22.765
Good.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.318
The last thing i need right now
is another jealous boyfriend.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.437
What, you got a lot of those,
hmm?

02:27.439 --> 02:29.906
You see?
You're jealous already.

02:29.908 --> 02:32.158
Come here.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.497
Oh!
I need to get this.

02:37.499 --> 02:39.198
Right now?

02:40.118 --> 02:42.452
Well,
you don't have to stop.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.507
Hello?

02:47.509 --> 02:49.792
Yeah, this is danni.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.679
Oh, my god.

02:53.681 --> 02:55.014
Oh, my god.

02:55.016 --> 02:57.016
Oh, my god!

02:57.018 --> 02:59.552
Hey, are those
"oh, my gods" for me?

03:03.358 --> 03:05.191
Carmen?

03:05.193 --> 03:06.893
Carmen!
There you are.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.444
I have to talk to you.
Me too.

03:08.446 --> 03:10.313
The most amazing thing
happened.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.115
I got into
a singer showcase!

03:12.117 --> 03:13.699
What?

03:13.701 --> 03:15.201
Yes, someone dropped out
at the last minute,

03:15.203 --> 03:16.736
So i'm going on
tomorrow night.
Yes, but --

03:16.738 --> 03:19.455
There's going to be
agents and producers.

03:19.457 --> 03:21.707
Okay, why aren't you
more excited?

03:21.709 --> 03:24.660
Daniela,
where have you been?

03:24.662 --> 03:27.497
<i>Mami,</i>
what are you doing here?

03:27.499 --> 03:28.965
Your cousin carmen
called me.

03:28.967 --> 03:30.500
I'm here to take you home.

03:31.970 --> 03:34.220
Surprise!

03:36.925 --> 03:39.976

03:44.682 --> 03:47.066
Yes, and i'm going to
keep hounding you

03:47.068 --> 03:48.518
Until i convince you.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.735
Great!

03:49.737 --> 03:51.654
Great.
See you thursday, cece.

03:51.656 --> 03:52.905
Marisol.

03:52.907 --> 03:54.323
I am grateful to stay here,

03:54.325 --> 03:56.159
But could you please
keep it down?

03:56.161 --> 03:57.944
My doctor says it's best
to wake naturally

03:57.946 --> 03:59.612
From
a merlot-and-ambien sleep.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.281
I'm sorry. Is my having a job
disturbing you?

04:02.283 --> 04:04.700
Exactly.
Thank you for understanding.

04:04.702 --> 04:08.087
Well, business is slow,
so i'm making cold calls,

04:08.089 --> 04:11.707
But i just landed a meeting
with cece sheffield.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.093
She owns that giant house
on roxbury --

04:14.095 --> 04:15.678
No domestic help at all.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.264
Speaking of domestic help,

04:18.266 --> 04:22.134
How do i place an order
for breakfast around here?

04:22.136 --> 04:24.937
Place an order? Evelyn,
this isn't the four seasons.

04:24.939 --> 04:27.557
That's apparent from the low
thread count of your sheets.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.525
There's cereal
in the kitchen.

04:29.527 --> 04:32.695
At the club, they have
a little man named jean-claude

04:32.697 --> 04:35.114
Who makes the most amazing
bespoke omelettes.

04:35.116 --> 04:37.116
I don't have
a little omelette man.

04:37.118 --> 04:40.736
Well, perhaps you should stop
worrying about cece sheffield

04:40.738 --> 04:42.455
And get some help
for yourself.

04:42.457 --> 04:45.374
Evelyn, why don't you just
go out for breakfast?

04:45.376 --> 04:47.460
Believe me, i would if i could,
but...

04:48.963 --> 04:50.796
...I can't exactly
afford it.

04:50.798 --> 04:54.333
Oh, wow. I didn't realize
things were that bad.

04:54.335 --> 04:56.385
Yes, for all
intents and purposes,

04:56.387 --> 04:58.588
Adrian has left me
destitute.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.473
Tell you what,

05:00.475 --> 05:02.225
Breakfast is on me.

05:02.227 --> 05:04.393
I want you to be happy.

05:04.395 --> 05:07.179
Oh, god,
how far i've fallen.

05:07.181 --> 05:09.232
Just a short while ago,
i was living in a lovely,

05:09.234 --> 05:11.567
Albeit blown-up, mansion,
and now...

05:11.569 --> 05:13.319
And now what?

05:13.321 --> 05:15.571
Nothing, nothing.
You have a fine home.

05:15.573 --> 05:17.189
It's cozy.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.025
Has it always been teal?

05:19.027 --> 05:21.077
How long you planning on
staying here?

05:21.079 --> 05:22.695
Not long.
Just a couple of days.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.080
Or i suppose it could be
several months,

05:24.082 --> 05:25.698
But that would be
the worst-case scenario.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.000
Yes.

05:28.002 --> 05:29.752
Yes, it would.

05:29.754 --> 05:31.587
You called my mother?!

05:31.589 --> 05:33.289
She was right to call me.

05:33.291 --> 05:36.042
Drinking, sleeping around,
crashing cars?

05:36.044 --> 05:37.293
You told her all that?!

05:37.295 --> 05:38.961
<i>Ay, virgen santa.</i>

05:38.963 --> 05:40.596
It's good
your father's dead.

05:40.598 --> 05:43.099
It would kill him to know
that you dropped out of college.

05:43.101 --> 05:44.684
ow!

05:44.686 --> 05:45.935
You dropped out of college?

05:45.937 --> 05:47.270
I didn't know
you were<i> in</i> college.

05:47.272 --> 05:48.354
Start packing your things.

05:48.356 --> 05:49.438
We're leaving tomorrow night.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.723
But the showcase
is tomorrow.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.942
Ay, again with this
singing nonsense.

05:52.944 --> 05:54.226
Carmen's a singer.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.945
She's not a singer.
She's a maid.

05:55.947 --> 05:57.029
That's just temporary.

05:57.031 --> 05:58.364
15 years
is not temporary.

05:58.366 --> 06:00.032
Who cares
if she's still a maid?

06:00.034 --> 06:01.567
She's going after her dream.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.818
But that's just it.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.954
It's only a dream.

06:04.956 --> 06:06.405
Her life is empty.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.457
She doesn't have a man.
At the moment.

06:08.459 --> 06:10.376
She doesn't have money.
Money isn't everything.

06:10.378 --> 06:11.794
And her looks
are starting to fade.

06:11.796 --> 06:13.879
Okay,
now you're talking crazy.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.049
The point is,

06:17.051 --> 06:20.970
You wish you had made
different choices in your life.

06:20.972 --> 06:22.638
Don't you, carmen?

06:24.142 --> 06:25.141
Right.

06:26.844 --> 06:29.478
I-it's too late for me, danni,
but you --

06:29.480 --> 06:31.063
Ugh!

06:31.065 --> 06:33.265
I can't believe this.

06:35.653 --> 06:37.603
You think
we were too hard on her?

06:37.605 --> 06:40.656
S-she really wants to
sing in the showcase.

06:40.658 --> 06:43.242
When you gave us daniela,

06:43.244 --> 06:45.361
You promised to stay
out of our life.

06:45.363 --> 06:46.495
I'm her mother.

06:46.497 --> 06:49.281
I get to decide, not you.

06:57.759 --> 07:00.126
Zoila. Hi.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.712
I saw your car and thought
you might be back.

07:02.714 --> 07:03.713
How was the trip?

07:03.715 --> 07:04.930
Fine.

07:04.932 --> 07:06.265
Yeah. You know?

07:06.267 --> 07:08.517
well, i missed you.

07:08.519 --> 07:10.386
I've been hanging out
with your mom,

07:10.388 --> 07:12.138
And she's great company,

07:12.140 --> 07:14.940
But i'm pretty sure
you're a better kisser.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.527
Good. Good.

07:18.529 --> 07:22.448
Listen, i-i'm glad
we can still be friends,

07:22.450 --> 07:24.817
Even though
things fizzled out.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.369
Fizzled out?

07:26.371 --> 07:29.538
Yeah, i went away, and
we didn't talk the whole time.

07:31.826 --> 07:34.377
Oh, god. I assumed
we're on the same page.

07:34.379 --> 07:37.463
Nope. Different page,
different book.

07:37.465 --> 07:39.799
I'm sorry.

07:39.801 --> 07:41.801
You're wonderful.

07:41.803 --> 07:43.419
Well, what?

07:43.421 --> 07:45.888
I thought things were going
really good.

07:45.890 --> 07:47.640
It's just...

07:47.642 --> 07:50.676
You know,
circumstances and timing.

07:50.678 --> 07:51.844
Whatnot.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.646
Now you're just
saying words.

07:53.648 --> 07:56.065
Sorry.
I-i'm terrible at breakups.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.653
Here.

08:03.324 --> 08:04.824
A parting gift?

08:04.826 --> 08:06.492
A token of
our time together.

08:06.494 --> 08:09.612
It's a candle.
Smells like juniper berries.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.086
Thank you, kyle.

08:17.088 --> 08:20.089
You just made it really easy
to get over you.

08:25.263 --> 08:27.379
Fabian,
i can't thank you enough

08:27.381 --> 08:29.298
For squeezing me in
at the last minute.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.100
Oh, my god.
It's my plej.

08:31.102 --> 08:33.052
Ah.
Look at your hair.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.386
Drop-dead gorge.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.772
It used to be
drop-dead gorge,

08:36.774 --> 08:40.810
But i recently had a falling-out
with my previous stylist.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.611
Whoever did this to you
is a criminal.

08:42.613 --> 08:45.548
Seriously, they should be
taken out and shot in the face.

08:45.550 --> 08:47.650
What a sweet thing to say.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.485
Anyway...

08:49.487 --> 08:51.537
I'm in the market
for a new look.

08:51.539 --> 08:53.823
Makeovers always
make me feel better.

08:53.825 --> 08:57.192
And truth be told, i've been
a bit depressed lately.

08:57.194 --> 08:58.577
Unh-unh.

08:58.579 --> 09:01.297
You are way too fab
to be down in the dumps.

09:01.299 --> 09:03.415
What's wrong?

09:03.417 --> 09:06.469
I recently lost my housekeeper,
zoila.

09:06.471 --> 09:08.888
My condolences.

09:08.890 --> 09:10.589
Bless her little soul.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.258
Oh, she's not dead.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.260
She just doesn't want
to be friends anymore.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.145
You were friends
with your housekeeper?

09:16.147 --> 09:18.481
I know it sounds funny,

09:18.483 --> 09:21.066
But she's always been
my closest confidante.

09:21.068 --> 09:23.319
I miss having someone
in the house to talk to.

09:23.321 --> 09:25.404
Well,
what about the new maid?

09:25.406 --> 09:27.106
Rosie?

09:27.108 --> 09:29.942
No, i'm afraid we don't
have much in common.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.494
Well, i'm sure you didn't
have a lot in common

09:31.496 --> 09:33.362
With the old maid
when you first met her.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.613
That's true.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.749
So get to know
this rosie chick.

09:36.751 --> 09:38.501
I mean, you're so stylish,

09:38.503 --> 09:40.119
You live in
this amazing mansh,

09:40.121 --> 09:41.704
And you're
impossibly thin.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.923
Who wouldn't want
to be your friend?

09:43.925 --> 09:45.474
That's an excellent point.

09:45.476 --> 09:48.460
See?
Things are looking up already.

09:48.462 --> 09:53.349
Now let's make this hair
as ferocious as you are.

09:53.351 --> 09:54.550
Oh!

09:58.189 --> 10:01.190
Not really sure why shannon
wanted me to trim the hedges.

10:01.192 --> 10:03.025
The gardeners
will be here tomorrow.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.729
I think i know why.

10:06.731 --> 10:07.813
Hey.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.315
I been meaning to ask,

10:09.317 --> 10:12.151
Any luck tracking down
spence's alibi, the stripper?

10:12.153 --> 10:13.369
No.

10:13.371 --> 10:14.703
She's not
returning my calls,

10:14.705 --> 10:16.322
And nobody's seen her.

10:16.324 --> 10:19.825
If you need me to go down
to the strip club, i'll do it.

10:19.827 --> 10:22.545
Thanks, jesse.
Way to take one for the team.

10:22.547 --> 10:25.664
Anyway,
i think she's gone for good.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.133
Don't lose hope. You'll find
another way to help spence.

10:28.135 --> 10:30.920
The police should be looking at
peri's manager, ben.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.638
He's hiding something.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.341
But why would ben
kill peri?

10:35.343 --> 10:36.892
She made him
a boatload of money.

10:36.894 --> 10:38.427
He had nothing to gain.

10:39.647 --> 10:43.649
So the question is, whose life
is better with peri dead?

10:43.651 --> 10:46.602
I'm home!

10:46.604 --> 10:48.487
Oh.

10:48.489 --> 10:50.356
Jesse.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.691
You've been working
so hard.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.410
I want to give you
a little bonus.

10:54.412 --> 10:56.779
Buy yourself
something pretty --

10:56.781 --> 10:59.164
Not a shirt.

10:59.166 --> 11:02.001
Miss shannon, you got
a lot of stuff today.

11:02.003 --> 11:03.535
So?

11:03.537 --> 11:06.038
Well, isn't peri's money
supposed to be for tucker?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.790
Well,
i needed some things --

11:07.792 --> 11:11.043
Proper attire for me to
mourn the loss of my sister.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.212
Hmm. Like this?

11:14.882 --> 11:16.799
Zebra was peri's favorite.

11:25.977 --> 11:28.177
Well, what do you think?

11:28.179 --> 11:30.313
The furniture.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.398
The drapes!

11:32.400 --> 11:33.766
What happened?

11:33.768 --> 11:35.318
After breakfast,
i took a stroll

11:35.320 --> 11:38.821
Down to this little boutique
on rodeo and...

11:38.823 --> 11:40.373
Ta-da!

11:40.375 --> 11:41.908
I bought you
a whole new living room --

11:41.910 --> 11:43.359
And also new sheets.

11:43.361 --> 11:45.695
Did you put all of this
on my credit card?

11:45.697 --> 11:48.748
Well,
i'll pay you back one day.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.867
You said you wanted me
to be happy,

11:50.869 --> 11:54.754
And changing all your furniture
made me so happy.

11:54.756 --> 11:59.259
I meant to treat yourself
to a muffin, not a...

11:59.261 --> 12:02.045
19th-century edwardian
side chair upholstered in sable?

12:02.047 --> 12:03.680
Yeah, not that!

12:03.682 --> 12:05.298
I liked my old furniture.

12:05.300 --> 12:06.599
Really?

12:06.601 --> 12:07.800
Yes.

12:07.802 --> 12:10.937
All of this
has to go back!

12:10.939 --> 12:14.641
Evelyn, it is time
to accept reality.

12:14.643 --> 12:16.276
You don't have any money.

12:16.278 --> 12:19.062
That means you have to start
fending for yourself.

12:19.981 --> 12:21.698
That means get a job.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.117
that is quite possibly

12:24.119 --> 12:26.569
The ugliest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

12:26.571 --> 12:27.820
Tough!

12:27.822 --> 12:29.372
Now give me back
my credit card.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.158
Evelyn.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.499
Trust me,
it's for your own good.

12:47.342 --> 12:49.642
Rosie. Good.

12:49.644 --> 12:52.312
I've been wanting to talk to you
about dinner tonight.

12:52.314 --> 12:54.597
I left it in the refrigerator,
mrs. Genevieve.

12:54.599 --> 12:55.898
It's ready
whenever you want.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.101
You've misunderstood me,
dear.

12:58.103 --> 13:00.820
I'm inviting you
to join me for dinner.

13:00.822 --> 13:03.272
Oh. Really?

13:03.274 --> 13:05.191
I'd like to get to know you
better.

13:05.193 --> 13:07.243
What's rosie been up to
lately?

13:07.245 --> 13:10.029
Still trying to
get spence out of prison.

13:10.031 --> 13:12.115
Yes. Right. That.

13:12.117 --> 13:14.500
Actually, i'm on my way out
to see him now.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.453
But surely you have time
for dinner?

13:17.455 --> 13:20.123
I mean, spence isn't
going anywhere.

13:21.426 --> 13:25.211
No, he's not, but i don't want
to miss visiting hours.

13:25.213 --> 13:28.214
Maybe we should have dinner
tomorrow?

13:28.216 --> 13:29.632
Perfect.

13:29.634 --> 13:31.267
I'll make
all the arrangements.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.852
You won't have to
lift a finger.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.887
I don't mind.
Nonsense.

13:34.889 --> 13:36.723
That's what friends
are for.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.697
Can i talk to you?

13:44.699 --> 13:47.400
What do you want to talk about,
how you ruined my life?

13:47.402 --> 13:50.319
Or maybe skip that part and go
right to you forgiving me.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.573
Danni, i know you're mad
about the showcase,

13:53.575 --> 13:55.208
But your mom is just
looking out for you.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.377
<i>Mami</i>
doesn't understood me.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.829
But out of all people,
i thought you did.

13:59.831 --> 14:03.666
I understand --
more than you know.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.218
But i don't want you to
live my life.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.719
I want better for you.

14:06.721 --> 14:09.055
It's all i ever wanted.

14:10.842 --> 14:12.425
But now
it's never gonna happen.

14:15.013 --> 14:16.396
What if there was a way

14:16.398 --> 14:18.981
You could still
sing in the showcase?

14:20.151 --> 14:21.567
You're gonna stand up to<i> mami</i>
for me?

14:21.569 --> 14:22.985
No. God, no.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.771
That woman scares the hell
out of me.

14:24.773 --> 14:27.073
Then how are you gonna
change her mind?

14:27.075 --> 14:29.358
How else?

14:29.360 --> 14:32.028
We're going to
lie our asses off.

14:36.785 --> 14:40.670
Spence, how did peri get along
with shannon?

14:40.672 --> 14:42.171
Did they ever fight?

14:42.173 --> 14:44.207
Yeah, yeah, of course they
fought. They were sisters.

14:44.209 --> 14:47.460
I'm trying to figure out if
shannon could've killed peri.

14:47.462 --> 14:49.262
shannon was always jealous.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.130
She wanted to be an actress,
too,

14:51.132 --> 14:53.182
But she was always
living in peri's shadow.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.852
Did you ever see shannon
get violent?

14:55.854 --> 14:58.137
You know, i -- if i had all the
answers, i wouldn't be in here.

14:58.139 --> 15:00.022
What is the matter
with you?

15:00.024 --> 15:01.390
I'm sorry. It just...

15:02.610 --> 15:04.360
This place is really
getting to me.

15:04.362 --> 15:05.728
I can't sleep.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.313
There's this inmate
who keeps watching me.

15:07.315 --> 15:08.781
His name is "kill face."

15:08.783 --> 15:11.651
Kill face?
Why do they call him kill face?

15:11.653 --> 15:15.822
'cause he has the word "kill"
tattooed on his face.

15:15.824 --> 15:17.457
That sounds painful.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.075
I must've wandered into his turf
or something,

15:19.077 --> 15:20.910
And now
he wants to shiv me...

15:20.912 --> 15:22.078
Or worse.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.412
What could be worse?

15:23.414 --> 15:25.298
Rosie, come on.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.750
I may be 50,
but i am very, very handsome.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.218
Oh.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.170
And look at these guys.

15:31.172 --> 15:34.006
I'm the megan fox
of this prison.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.761
Thanks for inviting me out.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.646
I assume you heard about
me and kyle.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.732
Yeah.
Did he give you the candle?

15:42.734 --> 15:44.183
Yes.

15:44.185 --> 15:46.068
What's up with that?
I don't know.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.738
I told him it's bizarre
to give a breakup gift.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.773
He acted like
we'd already broken up.

15:50.775 --> 15:55.027
Well, i-it's just
kyle being kyle.

15:55.029 --> 15:56.579
I'm sorry.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.915
He's your son. I'm putting you
in a terrible position.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.450
Stop!
You and i are friends.

16:01.452 --> 16:03.169
At least
i hope we still are.

16:04.255 --> 16:06.539
And as your friend,
i need to point out

16:06.541 --> 16:09.292
That there are lots of
other fish in this room --

16:09.294 --> 16:10.843
Eligible fish.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.763
Oh, i don't think
i'm ready to go fishing

16:13.765 --> 16:15.097
The same day i got dumped.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.016
And i know
the perfect one.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.935
Are you even
listening to me?

16:18.937 --> 16:22.388
He's recently separated,
highly entertaining,

16:22.390 --> 16:25.224
Has a bajillion dollars...

16:25.226 --> 16:26.943
And he's coming this way.

16:31.733 --> 16:34.033
Just excuse me one...

16:34.035 --> 16:35.735
oh.
Ooh, i'm s-- i'm sorry.

16:35.737 --> 16:37.486
I'm just gonna go this way.
Sorry.

16:37.488 --> 16:39.071
A-aah!

16:39.073 --> 16:40.957
Oh!

16:40.959 --> 16:41.958
Are you all right?

16:41.960 --> 16:44.460
Um...I'm fine.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.078
I'm fine.

16:46.080 --> 16:49.582
Adrian powell, have you ever met
my dear friend zoila?

16:51.386 --> 16:52.418
Actually...

16:52.420 --> 16:54.086
No.

16:54.088 --> 16:55.638
No?

16:55.640 --> 16:57.340
I would definitely
remember meeting

16:57.342 --> 16:59.392
Someone as enchanting
as you.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.441
Ooh, marisol! Look at
the ritzy new furniture!

17:07.443 --> 17:08.492
Yeah.
Don't get used to it.

17:08.494 --> 17:09.860
It's all going back.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.311
Well,
i think it's much better.

17:11.313 --> 17:13.313
I didn't like your
ratty old stuff at all.

17:13.315 --> 17:14.781
See, marisol?

17:14.783 --> 17:18.535
These new pieces
are a major step up.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.487
Ha.

17:20.489 --> 17:22.489
Sorry, is this
a private maid meeting,

17:22.491 --> 17:24.124
Or can anyone join in?

17:24.126 --> 17:25.792
No, it's fine.

17:25.794 --> 17:28.412
Weird, but fine.

17:28.414 --> 17:32.549
So...What's the hot gossip
in your world?

17:32.551 --> 17:35.652
Any maid sleeping with
their owner?

17:35.654 --> 17:37.421
homeowner.
Was that not clear?

17:37.423 --> 17:41.391
So, rosie, how is spence
holding up in prison?

17:41.393 --> 17:43.594
Yes. Dish.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.480
Spence says there's an inmate
that wants to kill him --

17:46.482 --> 17:49.399
Or maybe kiss him,
but probably kill.

17:49.401 --> 17:51.018
You must be so worried.

17:51.020 --> 17:53.737
Oh!
Rosie, i feel for you.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.656
Actually,
i feel for all of you.

17:55.658 --> 17:58.492
I don't know if you've heard,
but i'm poor now, too,

17:58.494 --> 18:00.611
And being poor is horrible!

18:00.613 --> 18:02.029
Am i right,<i> chicas?</i>

18:03.999 --> 18:05.999
Evelyn, can you give me a hand
in the kitchen?

18:06.001 --> 18:07.534
Absolutely.

18:07.536 --> 18:10.003
Don't talk about me
while i'm gone.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.173
Before they get back,

18:13.175 --> 18:15.209
I have to tell you a secret
only carmen knows.

18:15.211 --> 18:17.044
You're pretending to be rich
to your neighbors,

18:17.046 --> 18:19.096
You go to fancy parties,
and you wear pantsuits.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.382
What?

18:22.384 --> 18:24.384
I got a big mouth.
You should've known better.

18:24.386 --> 18:28.222
Well, i went to a dinner
last night, and...

18:28.224 --> 18:29.773
Adrian powell saw me.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.309
i knew
you were gonna get busted.

18:32.311 --> 18:35.479
Nope. He didn't recognize me.
Can you believe that?

18:35.481 --> 18:37.648
He's been to genevieve's
a thousand times,

18:37.650 --> 18:38.982
But i was just the maid,

18:38.984 --> 18:40.784
So i guess that
racist little troll

18:40.786 --> 18:42.152
Never even noticed me.

18:42.154 --> 18:44.404
I was spence's maid,
and he noticed me.

18:44.406 --> 18:46.573
Maybe you should try wearing
more mascara.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.376
And a little lip gloss
wouldn't kill you.

18:52.998 --> 18:55.332
I don't know why you asked me
to help get coffee.

18:55.334 --> 18:57.251
You have three
perfectly good maids

18:57.253 --> 18:58.585
Sitting in
your living room.

18:58.587 --> 19:00.504
Yes, you seem to be
making yourself

19:00.506 --> 19:02.089
Right at home
with my friends.

19:02.091 --> 19:05.726
Soon i'll be eating chimichangas
and rolling my r's.

19:06.845 --> 19:08.679
Have you got a job yet?

19:08.681 --> 19:11.515
Marisol, i'm starting to suspect
you want me out of your house.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.350
I do.
Have i been too subtle?

19:13.352 --> 19:16.103
Look, i don't enjoy living in
your little tenement, either,

19:16.105 --> 19:18.405
But i don't think
a job is the answer.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.608
Well, how do you know
if you've never had one?

19:22.695 --> 19:24.995
Why don't you call
my friend andrea?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.913
She's a career counselor,

19:26.915 --> 19:30.500
And she can help you decide
where to get started.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.202
Thank you
for the suggestion.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.537
not a suggestion.

19:45.934 --> 19:48.935
Westmore.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.937
Oh, hey, kill face.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.140
That's not my name.

19:53.142 --> 19:55.359
Really?
Oh, i just assumed,

19:55.361 --> 19:57.277
You know, 'cause other people
call you that,

19:57.279 --> 19:59.279
Plus you got that tattoo,

19:59.281 --> 20:01.865
Which is nice,
by the way.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.735
Say,
you got great teeth.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.620
Thanks.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.373
What a terrifying
compliment.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.491
Nice and white.

20:11.493 --> 20:13.460
Smile for me, westmore.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.461
Huh?

20:14.463 --> 20:16.963
Prisoners, separate.

20:16.965 --> 20:20.717
Well, you heard the man.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.586
See you later.

20:22.588 --> 20:24.671
Yes.

20:24.673 --> 20:26.139
You will.

20:34.516 --> 20:36.817
Carmen, the showcase
is in two hours.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.235
What are we gonna do
about<i> mami?</i>

20:38.237 --> 20:41.071
Relax. I'm taking her on
a private bus tour,

20:41.073 --> 20:42.856
And i paid the driver
to "run out of gas"

20:42.858 --> 20:44.241
So she'll miss
the flight.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.026
<i>Y pracatÃ¡.</i>
I'll get to do the showcase.

20:46.028 --> 20:47.327
Yes.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.945
Daniela.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.330
Go get your suitcase.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.915
We're going to the airport.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.784
But the flight's
not till tonight.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.202
Yeah, josefina.

20:55.204 --> 20:57.120
I booked us a tour of
movie star homes,

20:57.122 --> 20:59.005
And we're gonna go see
george clooney's house.

20:59.007 --> 21:01.291
George clooney? What do i care
about george clooney?

21:01.293 --> 21:03.543
What about
channing tatum?

21:03.545 --> 21:05.178
Who?
You know.

21:05.180 --> 21:07.431
"magic mike."

21:09.134 --> 21:10.567
Try david hasselhoff.

21:10.569 --> 21:11.718
Really?
David hasselhoff?

21:11.720 --> 21:13.186
Oh, my god, i love him.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.721
Is he on the tour?

21:14.723 --> 21:16.390
Mm-hmm.

21:16.392 --> 21:18.942
And i heard the talking car
lives with him, too. You in?

21:18.944 --> 21:22.229
No. I don't want us to get stuck
in traffic.

21:22.231 --> 21:23.563
Daniela,<i> apurate.</i>

21:23.565 --> 21:25.649
The taxi will be here
any minute.

21:25.651 --> 21:26.817
Do something.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.034
Josefina!

21:28.036 --> 21:29.703
Actually, the front door
is over here.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.955
It is?
I know.

21:31.957 --> 21:35.292
With all the construction going
on, i get all confused, too.

21:36.578 --> 21:38.545
After you.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.213
This doesn't
look like the --

21:40.215 --> 21:41.832
What are you doing?!
Plan "b."

21:41.834 --> 21:43.133
Quick, get the chair.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.218
Carmen!
The door won't open!

21:45.220 --> 21:46.887
Oh, my god,
she's gonna kill us.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.472
Do you want to go
to the showcase or not?

21:49.475 --> 21:50.924
<i>Mami,</i> the door's stuck.

21:50.926 --> 21:52.392
We're gonna go
get some help.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.511
Yeah, we're gonna be back
really soon.

21:54.513 --> 21:56.847
Daniela.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.598
Carmen?

22:01.520 --> 22:03.019
Hey, jesse.

22:03.021 --> 22:04.921
Could you take tucker
to the park?

22:04.923 --> 22:06.823
He loves
to feed the duckies.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.024
Why don't you take him?

22:08.026 --> 22:09.359
Tucker wants you.

22:09.361 --> 22:11.027
I think he really
looks up to you.

22:11.029 --> 22:12.662
You just want the house
to yourself

22:12.664 --> 22:14.414
So you can snoop around
before shannon gets home.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.283
That too.
Thanks, jesse.

22:16.285 --> 22:17.617
Let's go to the park!

22:17.619 --> 22:19.252
Quack! Quack!
Quack! Quack! Quack!

22:19.254 --> 22:22.506
He just ate a bunch of sugar,
so he's got lots of energy.

22:22.508 --> 22:23.790
Have fun.

22:23.792 --> 22:26.426
Quack! Quack!
Quack! Quack! Quack!

22:49.868 --> 22:52.619
That's some dress
you're wearing.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.321
[ shannon
speaks indistinctly ]

22:57.409 --> 23:00.544
Treated myself
to a little shopping spree.

23:00.546 --> 23:04.047
Well, maybe don't go overboard
with the spending right now.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.249
Oh, come on, ben.

23:06.251 --> 23:09.419
I'm just
having a little fun.

23:09.421 --> 23:12.489
Your sister just died.
It looks suspicious.

23:12.491 --> 23:14.424
You're right.

23:14.426 --> 23:16.476
You're always right.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.562
I've been bad.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.397
I guess
i should be punished?

23:20.399 --> 23:22.766
Hmm.
Well, that can be arranged.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.512
I hope you don't mind
my dropping by.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.181
I just wanted to see how
you're doing since evelyn left.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.482
Oh, i'm not worried
about evelyn.

23:55.484 --> 23:57.234
She'll come back
sooner or later.

23:57.236 --> 24:00.270
But sooner better than later,
right?

24:00.272 --> 24:02.406
For you, i mean.

24:02.408 --> 24:05.242
Oh,
she's staying with you.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.860
Marisol,
this is delightful.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.412
Delightful? Why?

24:08.414 --> 24:09.696
She's hit rock bottom.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.198
Tell me something.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.333
Is she sleeping on
a pull-out sofa?

24:13.335 --> 24:15.202
A blow-up mattress,
a cot?

24:15.204 --> 24:17.454
Why does everyone think
my place is so crappy?

24:17.456 --> 24:18.872
Point is, i'm winning.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.457
It's not a game.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.759
Evelyn is really suffering.

24:22.761 --> 24:24.795
At least grant her access
to her money.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.546
Never.
That's my leverage.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.381
You're just making her
resent you.

24:28.383 --> 24:30.100
Resentment, rage,
despair --

24:30.102 --> 24:33.770
It's all part of demolishing
her spirit into a fine dust.

24:33.772 --> 24:36.273
But i thought
you wanted her back.

24:36.275 --> 24:39.643
I do. But first she needs to
learn a little lesson.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.314
So this never happens
again.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.400
Maybe instead of
punishing her,

24:47.402 --> 24:50.821
You should be wondering why
she left you in the first place.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.907
Give her a kiss for me.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.125
You're an ass.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.878
Hello?

24:57.880 --> 24:59.830
Hello?

25:01.583 --> 25:03.467
Is anybody out there?

25:07.005 --> 25:08.839
Who the hell are you?

25:08.841 --> 25:12.142
<i>Esa bruja descarada me encerrÃ³</i>
<i>aquÃ­ y se escapÃ³ con mi hija!</i>

25:12.144 --> 25:13.977
<i>Ahora voy a perder mi vuelo!</i>

25:13.979 --> 25:16.346
<i>La voy a matar!</i>

25:16.348 --> 25:20.817
Oh, well, that explains it.

25:20.819 --> 25:21.985
Yes!

25:21.987 --> 25:24.070
Yes! Do it!

25:24.072 --> 25:25.188
Ben!

25:25.190 --> 25:27.858
Yeah!

25:32.698 --> 25:34.915
Oh, i really needed that.

25:34.917 --> 25:37.417
Wow, you got
a little carried away.

25:38.453 --> 25:39.920
Are you sure
nobody's home?

25:39.922 --> 25:41.338
Relax.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.373
Tucker's still at the park
with rosie.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.259
Oh, rosie.
How's she working out?

25:46.261 --> 25:48.595
Great. I mean,

25:48.597 --> 25:51.715
She's dumb as a doorknob,
but the kid loves her.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.300
And you're keeping an eye
on her, right?

25:53.302 --> 25:56.353
She's not asking questions
about spence?

25:56.355 --> 25:58.188
She doesn't have a clue.

25:58.190 --> 26:01.191
And she doesn't know anything
about the circle?

26:01.193 --> 26:03.360
You worry too much.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.232
Is that a phone?

26:12.454 --> 26:14.037
Maybe it was mine.

26:14.039 --> 26:16.373
I got to get out of here
anyway.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.875
I'm late for a meeting.

26:18.877 --> 26:21.044
Well, that's too bad.

26:22.497 --> 26:24.214
I'm ready for round two.

26:30.923 --> 26:34.724
Rosie, it's genevieve again.

26:34.726 --> 26:36.343
I thought we had dinner plans.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.061
Where are you?

26:38.063 --> 26:39.813
Call me, please.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.269
Play something happy.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.688
No,
that won't be necessary.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.323
I've been stood up.

26:50.325 --> 26:53.944
Who would stand up
a beautiful woman like you?

26:53.946 --> 26:55.579
I know, it's shocking.

26:55.581 --> 26:57.998
This whole dinner
was for my maid.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.034
I was trying to
make her my friend.

27:01.036 --> 27:04.871
Only now the funny thing is
i feel lonelier than ever.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.790
You know what you need?

27:06.792 --> 27:08.341
A man.

27:08.343 --> 27:11.011
Yes, i do.

27:11.013 --> 27:13.763
And i know
just the one to call.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.190
Josefina.
You're -- you're here.

27:24.192 --> 27:26.443
Ow!
You tricked me.

27:26.445 --> 27:27.727
You locked me in
that horrible little room.

27:27.729 --> 27:29.279
I'm sorry.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.564
Danni begged me to let her sing,
and i couldn't say no.

27:31.566 --> 27:33.400
Look, we're here now,
so just --

27:33.402 --> 27:35.452
Just let her perform.

27:35.454 --> 27:37.537
After what you two
did to me?

27:37.539 --> 27:39.572
Trust me.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.157
I've done a ton
of these showcases.

27:41.159 --> 27:44.711
Nothing ever comes of them.
It's very discouraging.

27:44.713 --> 27:46.546
You're trying to
trick me again.

27:46.548 --> 27:50.300
Unfortunately, i'm not.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.886
She's gonna sing her heart out,
and when nobody cares,

27:52.888 --> 27:54.888
She's gonna be on
the next flight back home.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.973
Just let her have
her moment.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.766
Hi.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.852
My name is daniela mercado,

28:08.854 --> 28:11.938
And this is my first showcase,
so...

28:58.820 --> 29:01.237
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.

29:19.257 --> 29:22.392
It was a shame you left the club
in such a hurry the other day.

29:22.394 --> 29:23.560
Sorry.

29:23.562 --> 29:24.728
Migraine.

29:24.730 --> 29:26.012
Came on quick.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.897
Remember adrian?

29:27.899 --> 29:30.066
I think you and he would be
an excellent match.

29:30.068 --> 29:32.435
i think it's coming back.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.187
What's wrong with adrian?

29:34.189 --> 29:36.439
You don't even know him.
I know his type,

29:36.441 --> 29:40.326
And there is no way
i would ever date adrian powell.

29:40.328 --> 29:42.112
So sorry i'm late.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.863
Blame it on the imbeciles
in this city

29:43.865 --> 29:45.198
Who can't make a left turn.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.918
Adrian,
you've met my friend zoila.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.254
Yes.

29:51.256 --> 29:53.006
But did i
get the date wrong?

29:53.008 --> 29:54.624
I thought you and i
were dining tonight.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.760
Oh, rats.
I must've double booked.

29:56.762 --> 29:58.128
Well, no worries.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.463
You know, i'm suddenly not
feeling well.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.515
A migraine.

30:02.517 --> 30:05.051
But why don't you two
have dinner anyway?

30:05.053 --> 30:06.636
As great as that sounds,

30:06.638 --> 30:08.104
I came in the car with you,
so --

30:08.106 --> 30:10.557
Oh, well,
adrian will drive you home,

30:10.559 --> 30:12.358
And dinner's on me.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.778
I feel just terrible
about this.

30:18.116 --> 30:20.116
Well, that had

30:20.118 --> 30:22.368
All of the subtlety
of a kardashian wedding.

30:22.370 --> 30:24.788
If you want to call it a night,
that is fine by me.

30:24.790 --> 30:26.239
Nonsense.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.658
As long as frances is
picking up the tab,

30:28.660 --> 30:31.494
We may as well enjoy it.
Excuse me.

30:31.496 --> 30:35.165
Yes, could i get a glass of the
'98 lafitte rothschild bordeaux?

30:35.167 --> 30:36.633
Make it a bottle.

30:39.838 --> 30:43.840
Let me ask you something,
are you happy doing this job?

30:43.842 --> 30:44.974
We all have to work.

30:44.976 --> 30:46.776
Do we, though?

30:46.778 --> 30:50.230
See, i'm supposed to be
looking for a job,

30:50.232 --> 30:51.931
But i don't know the first thing
about them.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.566
What does someone
in your position make?

30:53.568 --> 30:55.235
A million a year?
Less?

30:55.237 --> 31:00.573
your total is $6,836.16.

31:00.575 --> 31:02.826
Ooh, something
must've been on sale.

31:02.828 --> 31:04.194
Put it on this.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.746
Great.

31:06.748 --> 31:08.665
You're marisol suarez?

31:08.667 --> 31:10.333
<i>SÃ­!</i>

31:10.335 --> 31:12.285
May i see your license,
please?

31:13.622 --> 31:16.623
Okay, i'm not actually marisol,
but she's a dear friend.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.458
She'd be fine
if she knew i was using it.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.677
"if she knew"?

31:20.679 --> 31:22.011
I'm gonna have to
keep this card, ma'am.

31:22.013 --> 31:23.713
You can't do that.
Give it to me.

31:23.715 --> 31:24.797
Do not touch me.

31:24.799 --> 31:26.599
Really? Or what?

31:28.019 --> 31:30.436
Not how i expected that to go.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.269
It's been a long time since
i've been on a first date.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.604
I forgot how awkward it is
to make small talk

31:39.606 --> 31:40.772
With a complete stranger.

31:40.774 --> 31:42.991
Are you okay?

31:42.993 --> 31:46.744
I'm just having a hard time
swallowing this.

31:46.746 --> 31:48.446
Good evening, carlos.

31:48.448 --> 31:51.416
Could i trouble you for some
oysters rockefeller to start?

31:51.418 --> 31:53.451
Of course.
But i'm santiago.

31:53.453 --> 31:56.171
Oh. Oh.
Honest mistake.

31:56.173 --> 31:58.756
Don't do anything repulsive
to my oysters.

32:01.928 --> 32:03.344
What?

32:03.346 --> 32:05.380
You think all latinos
look alike.

32:05.382 --> 32:08.266
No, i think carlos and san diego
look alike.

32:08.268 --> 32:09.801
Because they're both brown?

32:09.803 --> 32:12.437
No, because
they're both waiters.

32:12.439 --> 32:14.889
I'm not a racist.
I'm a classist.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.941
That's just as bad.

32:16.943 --> 32:18.726
God, what is it like
to go through life

32:18.728 --> 32:21.029
Thinking whole groups of people
are below you?

32:21.031 --> 32:22.981
You can't even be bothered
to remember

32:22.983 --> 32:26.234
Something as simple
as what they look like.

32:26.236 --> 32:27.619
You know what you are?

32:27.621 --> 32:28.870
An idiot.

32:28.872 --> 32:30.622
You remind me of my wife.

32:32.042 --> 32:33.575
You seem to be
choking a lot.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.043
Perhaps you should
have that checked.

32:35.045 --> 32:37.262
I am nothing like evelyn.

32:37.264 --> 32:38.880
You know my wife?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.499
Only by reputation.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.384
Excuse me, santiago.
I'm sorry.

32:43.386 --> 32:46.271
Can we speed this along
and order, please? Thank you.

32:46.273 --> 32:48.840
I'm carlos.
That's santiago.

32:50.076 --> 32:51.309
It happens all the time.

33:00.403 --> 33:05.023
Mrs. Genevieve,
i am so, so sorry.

33:05.025 --> 33:07.108
It's fine.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.527
Clearly my dinner invitation
meant nothing to you.

33:09.529 --> 33:10.945
That's not true.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.198
I wanted to be here,
but i got stuck under a bed.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.700
And i couldn't leave because
these two people came in

33:15.702 --> 33:18.036
And started having sex
right on top of me.

33:18.038 --> 33:20.121
You don't have to lie,
rosie.

33:20.123 --> 33:23.341
If you didn't want to be my
friend, you just had to say so.

33:23.343 --> 33:26.711
Mrs. Genevieve, i do want to be
your friend very much.

33:26.713 --> 33:28.129
Well, i'm sorry.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.215
That position
has already been filled.

33:30.217 --> 33:33.434
Genevieve,
come dance with me.

33:33.436 --> 33:35.136
Who's that?

33:35.138 --> 33:37.055
Fabian, my hairdresser.

33:37.057 --> 33:38.856
I prefer hair magician.

33:40.193 --> 33:42.777
He's fabulous, funny,
fierce, ferocious,

33:42.779 --> 33:45.697
And officially
my new best friend.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.156
Sorry to postpone our meeting,
cece,

33:55.158 --> 33:57.709
But i have a friend
who needed my help.

33:57.711 --> 33:59.294
Yes, she is.

33:59.296 --> 34:02.330
Very, very sick.

34:02.332 --> 34:03.965
Thank you for understanding.

34:03.967 --> 34:06.084
i am so sorry, marisol.

34:06.086 --> 34:08.419
I know this is
a terrible inconvenience.

34:08.421 --> 34:10.972
Well,
i suppose cece sheffield

34:10.974 --> 34:14.676
And her very lucrative account
will have to wait.

34:14.678 --> 34:16.060
Let's just
get you out of here.

34:17.647 --> 34:20.732
Says you only had $2.07 on you
at the time of your arrest.

34:20.734 --> 34:23.401
That correct?
Shut up.

34:23.403 --> 34:26.020
I am so humiliated.

34:26.022 --> 34:29.774
I'm penniless, barefoot,

34:29.776 --> 34:31.576
And i just befriended
a prostitute

34:31.578 --> 34:33.111
Who undoubtedly
has more money than me.

34:33.113 --> 34:35.280
Stay strong, coco.

34:35.282 --> 34:38.333
This will all
turn out okay.

34:38.335 --> 34:39.917
No! Adrian was right.

34:39.919 --> 34:42.453
He said my life would be
terrible without him, and it is.

34:42.455 --> 34:43.671
I have to go back.

34:43.673 --> 34:45.256
Absolutely not.

34:45.258 --> 34:47.342
I won't allow you
to go back to that man.

34:47.344 --> 34:48.760
You deserve better.

34:48.762 --> 34:50.345
Trust me.

34:50.347 --> 34:51.929
We will
figure something out.

34:51.931 --> 34:54.716
You'll take care of me now?

34:56.603 --> 34:58.269
We will
figure something out.

35:02.142 --> 35:03.941
Hey!
How was your showcase?

35:03.943 --> 35:06.194
Oh.

35:06.196 --> 35:09.197
Not that i'm complaining,
but what are you doing?

35:09.199 --> 35:10.865
This is how i say goodbye.

35:10.867 --> 35:12.116
Goodbye?

35:12.118 --> 35:14.202
I'm going back to san juan
tomorrow.

35:15.955 --> 35:18.573
Whoa, what's going on?
Did your showcase go badly?

35:18.575 --> 35:20.875
No, i was amazing.

35:20.877 --> 35:22.243
But nobody cared.

35:22.245 --> 35:24.495
No agents or producers.

35:24.497 --> 35:25.747
My mom is right.

35:25.749 --> 35:27.749
It's just never gonna happen
for me.

35:27.751 --> 35:29.100
Wait.

35:29.102 --> 35:30.551
Wait, so that's it?

35:30.553 --> 35:31.719
You're going home?

35:31.721 --> 35:33.805
It's what she wants.

35:33.807 --> 35:36.674
Danni, you're an adult.
Who cares what your mom wants?

35:36.676 --> 35:39.310
Okay, you obviously don't have
a bossy latina mother.

35:39.312 --> 35:42.480
Yeah, but i know that
if you really want something,

35:42.482 --> 35:44.782
You can't just bail
at the first setback.

35:45.985 --> 35:48.119
What does it matter
to you?

35:48.121 --> 35:50.855
I know we agreed
to keep things casual,

35:50.857 --> 35:54.492
But the truth is...

35:54.494 --> 35:56.260
I don't want you to go.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.597
Hmm.

35:59.599 --> 36:01.666
Maybe i will stay.

36:03.169 --> 36:04.836
Great.

36:04.838 --> 36:07.255
But we can still
have the goodbye sex, right?

36:07.257 --> 36:08.923
Oh, yeah.
Okay.

36:12.345 --> 36:13.428
Kill face.

36:13.430 --> 36:15.546
Oh, god.
You're here.

36:15.548 --> 36:17.598
Listen, whatever i did,
i'm sorry.

36:17.600 --> 36:21.269
Shh! I'm not supposed to
be in here after lights out.

36:21.271 --> 36:22.470
But i need you.

36:22.472 --> 36:24.689
No, no,
you don't need me.

36:24.691 --> 36:26.391
Oh.
Ju-- we can...

36:34.317 --> 36:35.466
Wait, what's this?

36:35.468 --> 36:37.168
My script.

36:37.170 --> 36:38.870
Me and the other guys
are putting on a play.

36:38.872 --> 36:40.638
You're gonna be the lead.

36:40.640 --> 36:42.039
You want me to act?

36:42.041 --> 36:44.075
Weren't you dr. Lance
on "love affairs"?

36:44.077 --> 36:45.576
I freakin' loved
that show.

36:45.578 --> 36:47.044
Oh, god.

36:47.046 --> 36:48.379
You're a fan.

36:48.381 --> 36:51.499
We all are.
You're kind of a big deal.

36:51.501 --> 36:54.135
It's not every day we get
a celebrity murderer in here.

36:54.137 --> 36:56.721
Alleged celebrity murderer.

36:56.723 --> 36:59.974
Yeah, and i allegedly
stabbed that cop in the eye.

37:04.264 --> 37:06.848
You know, you really didn't have
to walk me to the door.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.100
Well, despite what
you might hear about me,

37:09.102 --> 37:10.985
I'm a gentleman.

37:10.987 --> 37:12.687
Anyway...

37:12.689 --> 37:14.322
I would like
to do this again.

37:14.324 --> 37:16.023
You're kidding, right?

37:16.025 --> 37:19.160
You're doing nothing to hide
your revulsion towards me,

37:19.162 --> 37:22.947
But there is nothing in
the world i enjoy so much...

37:22.949 --> 37:24.198
As a challenge.

37:32.091 --> 37:34.542
I knew those two
would hit it off.

37:36.379 --> 37:37.678
Yeah.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.715
Everyone's living
happily ever after.

37:44.888 --> 37:46.604
So, cece.

37:46.606 --> 37:48.105
What do i need to do

37:48.107 --> 37:50.525
To get one of my maids
into your beautiful home?

37:50.527 --> 37:53.394
Honestly, i don't much like
having strangers in my house.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.363
Yes, but these maids
aren't strangers.

37:55.365 --> 37:58.616
They're more like
friends with feather dusters.

37:58.618 --> 38:00.785
No offense, but i'm just not
a maid person.

38:00.787 --> 38:02.954
I only took this meeting
to get you to stop calling.

38:03.790 --> 38:05.406
Hello, cece.

38:05.408 --> 38:06.874
Evelyn,
what are you doing here?

38:06.876 --> 38:08.709
Oh,
i'm friends with marisol.

38:08.711 --> 38:10.077
Now, when is the last time
we saw each other?

38:10.079 --> 38:11.829
Your god-awful
holiday party?

38:11.831 --> 38:13.498
But look at you.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.967
Taking the bull by the horns
and rectifying the problem.

38:15.969 --> 38:17.635
Problem?
Was there a problem?

38:17.637 --> 38:18.886
Evelyn,
maybe you could give us --

38:18.888 --> 38:20.338
Your house
was downright filthy.

38:20.340 --> 38:21.889
The powder room
ran out of toilet paper,

38:21.891 --> 38:23.674
And the guests were playing
tic-tac-toe

38:23.676 --> 38:25.226
In the dust
on your piano.

38:26.813 --> 38:29.096
Marisol, you're sending me six
candidates this afternoon, yes?

38:30.433 --> 38:31.816
Absolutely.

38:31.818 --> 38:34.735
See you at the club.

38:37.490 --> 38:39.023
It never occurred to me

38:39.025 --> 38:41.192
To insult the client
to get their business.

38:41.194 --> 38:43.077
Sometimes the only way
to motivate the wealthy

38:43.079 --> 38:44.328
Is to embarrass them.

38:44.330 --> 38:46.531
So you did that
intentionally?

38:46.533 --> 38:49.750
I just wanted to repay you for
all i've put you through lately.

38:51.004 --> 38:55.456
Evelyn, i may regret this,
but...

38:55.458 --> 38:58.175
How'd you like to
come and work for me?

39:00.680 --> 39:01.696
Josefina.

39:01.698 --> 39:02.880
<i>Esperate.</i>

39:02.882 --> 39:05.182
I'm re-booking
our flight home.

39:05.184 --> 39:07.768
I think you should
let danni stay.

39:07.770 --> 39:09.887
I thought you wanted her
out of your hair.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.472
That was before
i heard her sing.

39:11.474 --> 39:13.190
She's --
she's really talented.

39:13.192 --> 39:14.442
You're talented.

39:14.444 --> 39:16.978
She's better than me.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.713
Ugh.

39:18.715 --> 39:21.449
And it nearly killed me to say
that, so you know it's true.

39:21.451 --> 39:23.651
Carmen.

39:23.653 --> 39:26.704
If you think
i'm gonna let daniela stay,

39:26.706 --> 39:28.539
You're crazier
than i thought.

39:28.541 --> 39:30.992
Okay, i know
you don't understand,

39:30.994 --> 39:32.994
But danni's an artist.

39:32.996 --> 39:35.129
She's never gonna be the person
you want her to be.

39:37.717 --> 39:40.301
So, now you're an expert
on daniela?

39:40.303 --> 39:42.553
After knowing her, what,
a month?

39:42.555 --> 39:44.088
Josefina --
no.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.974
Where were you when she was
sick with the chicken pox

39:46.976 --> 39:49.010
Or had her heart broken
by a boy?

39:50.980 --> 39:52.480
Exactly.

39:52.482 --> 39:54.982
So you don't get to decide
what daniela does.

39:54.984 --> 39:56.934
You gave up that right
years ago.

39:56.936 --> 39:59.737
Maybe, but you keep acting like
i'm nobody to her,

39:59.739 --> 40:01.322
And that's not true,
'cause i'm --

40:01.324 --> 40:03.107
Don't you dare say it!

40:03.109 --> 40:04.909
I'm her mother! Me!

40:04.911 --> 40:06.193
And i gave birth to her!

40:06.195 --> 40:08.329
What?

40:08.331 --> 40:09.780
Oh, my god.
Danni.

40:09.782 --> 40:13.417
Stay away from me,
both of you!

40:13.419 --> 40:16.253
Danni, please, please, don't --
danni.

40:23.262 --> 40:24.929
You know,
i wasn't sure at first,

40:24.931 --> 40:27.765
But i really think this pink
makes my toes pop.

40:29.268 --> 40:32.186
Fabian, i'm having
such a good time with you.

40:32.188 --> 40:35.222
You have brought a bit of
sunshine back into my life,

40:35.224 --> 40:37.141
And right when
i need it most.

40:37.143 --> 40:39.810
You know, you should meet
some of my friends.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.646
I think
you'd really like them.

40:41.648 --> 40:43.280
Are they all
as much fun as you?

40:43.282 --> 40:44.699
Sort of.

40:44.701 --> 40:46.150
We're all
a part of this group

40:46.152 --> 40:48.035
Where we get together
and discuss things.

40:48.037 --> 40:49.487
Like a book club?

40:49.489 --> 40:51.238
Something like that.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.240
You should read this.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.876
It's going to
change your life.
