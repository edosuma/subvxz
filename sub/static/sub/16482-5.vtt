WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:04.970
You promise you like your gift?

00:04.971 --> 00:06.171
<i> Previously, on</i> this is us...

00:06.173 --> 00:07.439
The towel?
It's absolutely terrible.

00:08.476 --> 00:09.541
He said
you just go up and over

00:09.543 --> 00:10.542
and burrito him.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.644
They'll be in college soon.

00:12.646 --> 00:13.812
Your highness.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.280
Need to find you a crown.

00:19.954 --> 00:21.053
we're pretty good together.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.688
<i> These L.A. actors,</i>

00:22.690 --> 00:24.823
they come out here, right?
They do their little stint

00:24.825 --> 00:27.159
in theater just to feel better
about themselves.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.395
I'm here for the right reasons.
Let's get this
over with, shall we?

00:29.397 --> 00:30.729
You got the part.
Wait, I'm sorry. What?

00:30.731 --> 00:32.731
They think the nanny
will sell tickets.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.666
I did everything wrong by you,

00:34.668 --> 00:36.335
and you've done
everything right.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.336
Look. It's Kevin.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.737
Yo.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.406
This is my biological father.

00:41.842 --> 00:44.476
Wow. Well, that
probably is gonna be

00:44.478 --> 00:46.712
a longer conversation,
but it's good to meet you.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.313
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.817
Long signal pass.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.819
Baltimore hopping out of
an eight man front.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.521
Namath throwing deep.

00:55.523 --> 00:56.755
Sauer, gets wide, get it,

00:56.757 --> 00:58.323
he was there.

00:58.325 --> 00:59.925
He had an inside step
on Lenny Miles...

00:59.927 --> 01:00.926
Beer.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.327
Mommy.

01:02.329 --> 01:03.362
Rebecca, you and your sister

01:03.364 --> 01:04.596
need to play somewhere else.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.999
Your father's trying
to watch the game.

01:09.503 --> 01:10.736
...rick volk, number 21,

01:10.738 --> 01:12.237
uh, coming with a fake

01:12.239 --> 01:14.106
safety blitz
and he goes up top.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.908
So that, um,
is in pretty good...

01:15.910 --> 01:18.243
He doesn't get all
the glory of rocky bleier

01:18.245 --> 01:20.212
or Franco Harris,
but he's been a great...

01:22.083 --> 01:23.348
Jack.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.250
Jack.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.252
Jack!

01:27.254 --> 01:28.520
Yeah.

01:28.522 --> 01:29.688
Sorry.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.291
No. I refuse to be my mother

01:32.293 --> 01:34.626
staring at my father as he
stares at the television.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.929
Okay. Mm-hmm.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.964
I think Cincinnati's
looked a little tired...

01:38.966 --> 01:40.899
So teach me.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.602
Teach me football.

01:44.972 --> 01:47.106
<i> We got an offensive line...</i>

01:47.108 --> 01:48.640
Mm-hmm.
...Defensive line. Quart...

01:48.642 --> 01:51.076
End zone, end zone.
End zone, quarterback...

01:51.078 --> 01:52.077
There's bradshaw
straight back...

01:52.079 --> 01:53.612
You suck, bradshaw!

01:53.614 --> 01:54.813
Come on, man.
Babe...

01:54.815 --> 01:56.081
The man has three
super bowl rings.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.382
Give him a break.
Yeah, he also

01:57.384 --> 01:58.717
had Franco wide open
in the flat.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.487
You're a freakin' bum, bradshaw.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.455
You're a freakin' bum.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.758
Typical bradshaw.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.827
Super bowl!

02:08.829 --> 02:10.329
Mm! Mwah!

02:10.330 --> 02:11.763
Oh.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.499
Time to tailgate!
Oh, already?

02:13.501 --> 02:15.501
Yeah, babe. I got to move.
Froggy's wants me to sing

02:15.503 --> 02:16.602
at their pre-game party.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.070
Super bowl Sunday?
Yeah.

02:18.072 --> 02:19.404
Biggest crowd of the whole year.

02:19.406 --> 02:20.672
And we get to drink for free.
Oh, yeah.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.274
So be there early, okay?

02:22.276 --> 02:23.475
I'll be there before
bradshaw even begins

02:23.477 --> 02:25.077
warming up his old noodle arm.

02:25.079 --> 02:27.246
Whoa. Easy on bradshaw, babe.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.014
Uh-huh. Not in this house.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.016
That's my girl.
Hmm.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.451
Are Miguel and Shelly
gonna make it?

02:32.453 --> 02:34.353
Yeah. They're gonna
meet us there, you know,

02:34.355 --> 02:35.587
depending on if they can
get a babysitter,

02:35.589 --> 02:37.122
and one that doesn't
show up completely

02:37.124 --> 02:39.091
stoned out of her gourd
this time.

02:39.093 --> 02:42.027
Why do people have kids?

02:43.197 --> 02:45.130
No idea.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.438
All right.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.673
You okay?

02:58.646 --> 02:59.978
Stop.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.113
Randall, wake the hell up.

03:01.115 --> 03:02.548
You almost put a chemo pill

03:02.550 --> 03:04.116
in your shake.

03:04.118 --> 03:05.284
Oh.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.954
Uncle Kevin,

03:08.956 --> 03:10.622
why are you writing
in your book?

03:10.624 --> 03:12.391
Play, sweetheart. It's a play,

03:12.393 --> 03:14.660
and the director
wants me doing scene work.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.395
You seem to be doing
a lot of writing.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.097
Well, I seem to be getting
a lot of direction, William.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.467
Tell you what.
You got a great voice.

03:22.469 --> 03:24.703
You ever do any
voice-over work?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.171
Well, you should.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.839
Really. I mean,
you could be a...

03:27.841 --> 03:30.175
Like a... like a...
Like an owl in a pixar movie,

03:30.177 --> 03:31.977
right?
- Yeah.

03:31.979 --> 03:34.313
No offense.
Not sure why I would
take offense to that.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.149
Oh, I don't do blueberries.

03:37.151 --> 03:39.651
Me neither.
Since when?

03:39.653 --> 03:41.320
Since now.
- Yeah.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.487
It's not the taste, right?

03:42.489 --> 03:44.156
It's the texture of
the skin, it's gross.

03:44.158 --> 03:46.325
Yeah. I don't want
blueberries either.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.427
Yeah. Understood. Uh, any other
dietary restrictions

03:48.429 --> 03:50.062
I should let the
staff know about?

03:50.064 --> 03:51.830
No, man. You're busy.
I'll just, you know,

03:51.832 --> 03:53.665
I'll make a list for you later
when I get some time.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.034
Thanks, buddy.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.608
You need to put something
in your stomach, William.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.977
Toast, pills, juice.
That's the order. Okay?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.546
Is that medicine?

04:07.548 --> 04:10.449
Do you have a cold,
grandpa?

04:10.451 --> 04:12.351
Grandpa's fine.
No. They're just vitamins.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.392
So.

04:21.394 --> 04:24.196
You, uh, told the girls
that he's grandpa,

04:24.198 --> 04:25.931
but not that he's sick. Right?

04:27.434 --> 04:29.167
That's ballsy.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.803
Hey, so, Kevin, uh,

04:31.805 --> 04:33.772
it's been a few
days now, you know,

04:33.774 --> 04:35.741
since you showed up.
Without calling.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.242
Right. And... and
it's great to see you.

04:37.244 --> 04:40.779
I was just sort
of wondering...

04:40.781 --> 04:42.748
How do I say this politely?

04:42.750 --> 04:43.882
When are you leaving?

04:43.884 --> 04:45.150
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.986
Yeah.

04:47.988 --> 04:51.323
No, I mean, come on.
I can, I... I can, um...

04:51.325 --> 04:54.159
I can get out of here
whenever. I just... I...

04:54.161 --> 04:56.628
I saw this as an opportunity
to hang with you two,

04:56.630 --> 04:58.063
you know, and
the girls, but, uh...

05:00.401 --> 05:02.434
Plus I... honestly,
this play, guys,

05:02.436 --> 05:04.636
it's kicking my ass
a little, you know?
Mm.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.138
And it's so lonely
at that hotel.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.240
I mean, I got this big
suite all to myself

05:08.242 --> 05:10.976
but I guess the bigger the hotel
room, the emptier it can feel.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.312
You know? I'm sitting
there. I got that

05:13.314 --> 05:14.846
800 thread count sheets.
I got the endless

05:14.848 --> 05:17.349
minibar snacks. You got
the fancy oatmeal soaps,

05:17.351 --> 05:19.451
plush robes and all
i can do is sit there

05:19.453 --> 05:21.019
and think about how...

05:21.021 --> 05:22.988
Quiet it is.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.091
We'll take it.
What's that?

05:26.093 --> 05:27.426
Uh, the hotel. Beth and I,
we'll take it, tonight.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.161
No, Randall.
Where are we gonna

05:29.163 --> 05:30.762
get a sitter?
No, we got two family members

05:30.764 --> 05:31.797
oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Living in our house for free.

05:31.799 --> 05:32.964
One of them played
a nanny on TV.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.666
No.
No, actually,
an au pair.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.668
Technically, I played
an au pair on TV.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.270
There's a difference.
A lot of people don't know that.

05:38.272 --> 05:40.138
I was... an au pair.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.306
They were gonna call the show,

05:41.308 --> 05:43.342
<i> what au pair,</i> but <i> the...</i>

05:43.344 --> 05:45.977
<i> Manny</i> tested better.
I-i can watch the girls.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.546
I'm-a go pack.
Okay.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.548
I'm-a go pack right now.
Wait.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.223
Good morning.

05:58.225 --> 05:59.725
Hey.
Hi.

05:59.727 --> 06:00.992
Breakfast in bed?

06:00.994 --> 06:02.327
Yeah.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.995
What did I do to deserve this?

06:03.997 --> 06:05.664
I don't know.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.299
You've done a lot of really
nice things for me,

06:07.301 --> 06:09.401
so I wanted to return the favor.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.870
Oh. By cutting up cardboard
into little squares

06:11.872 --> 06:13.138
and putting it in a bowl?

06:13.140 --> 06:14.373
Those are cheese squares.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.875
Oh, yum.
Hmm.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.076
Yeah. What's on top?

06:18.078 --> 06:19.311
Oh, hemp seed.

06:19.313 --> 06:20.746
Hemp seeds on top?

06:20.748 --> 06:21.880
Mm-hmm.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.482
Boy, you really buried the lede.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.217
Now I'm in.

06:25.219 --> 06:26.385
What? You're not

06:26.387 --> 06:28.854
gonna have any
nonsense made-up food?

06:28.856 --> 06:32.190
No. Getting weighed at
our meeting this afternoon.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.259
You know what?

06:34.261 --> 06:36.595
So am I.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.897
I probably shouldn't eat,
either. Damn.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.666
Mm-hmm.
Hey, what do you want
to do after the meeting?

06:41.668 --> 06:43.935
I was thinking miniature
golf. Last time,

06:43.937 --> 06:46.037
I was like, 20 under
going into the 18th,

06:46.039 --> 06:47.506
but that little windmill

06:47.508 --> 06:50.342
owns my ass.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.244
I can't. Steelers.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.512
<i> Sunday night football. </i>
Hmm.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.880
Saturday night football.

06:54.882 --> 06:55.881
With who?

06:55.883 --> 06:57.416
Oh, no one. Just me.

06:57.418 --> 06:59.351
All right. I'll watch with you.
Oh, no.

06:59.353 --> 07:01.620
Thanks, but I'm good.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.523
Seriously?

07:04.525 --> 07:06.925
You'd rather watch by yourself
than watch with me?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.927
Yeah. It's my thing.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.962
I have a little ritual.
You know? It's my thing.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.198
Well, your thing...

07:13.200 --> 07:14.433
Is sad.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.535
Not to me.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.736
Okay.

07:17.738 --> 07:18.937
Okay. How about this?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.472
You can watch football...

07:20.474 --> 07:21.973
All by yourself,

07:21.975 --> 07:24.943
which is totally normal,
but with me.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.611
Toby.
Hmm?

07:26.613 --> 07:28.780
This is something
that I do alone. Okay?

07:30.050 --> 07:31.817
Sure.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.152
Great. Thank you
for being so sweet.
Yeah.

07:36.223 --> 07:39.324
Can you bring, like,
a bowl of sugar for this?

07:41.000 --> 07:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:06.420 --> 08:08.820
Thank you. Go, steelers! Whoo!

08:11.258 --> 08:14.259
Thank, God. Can we please
watch the game now?

08:14.261 --> 08:16.161
The rose bowl is back.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.630
Not an empty seat anywhere.

08:18.632 --> 08:19.798
Hey.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.666
Excuse me.
That was amazing.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.767
Ah, yeah? Really?
Yeah.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.035
Oh! Shelly, Miguel.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.704
There they are. Hey!
- Yeah.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.172
So sorry we're late.
It's okay.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.473
Yeah.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

08:28.475 --> 08:29.841
Damn, kids, man.
Yeah, we were

08:29.843 --> 08:31.042
just about to
head out the door,

08:31.044 --> 08:32.611
and the baby decides
to projective vomit

08:32.613 --> 08:33.979
all over little Andy.
Yeah.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.813
Almost got me, too.
So, what does Andy do?

08:35.816 --> 08:37.215
You know, four years old.
Built like a tank.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.482
He slaps the baby.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.150
Right across the face. Pow!

08:40.153 --> 08:42.287
No! Is she okay?
Oh, she's fine. Yeah.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.188
But then the baby's screaming
bloody murder, I'm screaming

08:44.191 --> 08:46.157
at Andy, and me, standing there,
covered in vomit, and I'm like,

08:46.159 --> 08:47.559
Andy, she is a baby.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.060
Like, you literally
slapped a baby.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.362
Which really helped,
as you can imagine.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.163
Of course,
then Andy starts crying,

08:52.165 --> 08:54.232
baby's crying, babysitter's crying.
- We need drinks!

08:54.234 --> 08:55.667
<i> We</i> need drinks.
We'll be right back.

08:55.669 --> 08:56.968
Okay.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.070
Wow.

08:59.072 --> 09:02.040
Promise me we are
never having kids.

09:03.477 --> 09:05.010
I think it's time
for shots.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.511
Somebody's down.

09:06.513 --> 09:09.047
26 is having a tough day.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.595
The first half,
the rams, surprisingly,

09:23.597 --> 09:26.831
lead Pittsburgh 13 to ten.
- Pathetic.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.166
Can't stop the run.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.534
Oh, and bradshaw sucks!

09:29.536 --> 09:31.036
Oh, no, bradshaw's
gonna have

09:31.038 --> 09:32.837
a huge second half,
though. Right, babe?

09:32.839 --> 09:35.307
Yeah. Big...
Big second half.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.645
Are you okay?

09:41.715 --> 09:43.582
Mm. Fine.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.784
Okay.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.954
Actually, no.

09:48.956 --> 09:52.390
Um, what did you mean before
when, uh...

09:52.392 --> 09:53.892
When you said...

09:53.894 --> 09:56.394
"Promise me
we'll never have kids"?

09:56.396 --> 09:58.530
Oh. I shouldn't have said that.

09:58.532 --> 10:00.231
Yeah, but... you did.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.233
Kind of said it
twice today.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.269
And I shouldn't have.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.370
Okay?

10:05.372 --> 10:07.138
Sorry.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.573
You know what we
need to be doing?

10:08.575 --> 10:09.808
We need to be feeding

10:09.810 --> 10:11.710
the ball to Franco
more, right?

10:11.712 --> 10:15.046
That's...
'Cause we-we never
really talk about it.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.750
And I don't want to talk
about it now, either.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.152
We always say we're gonna talk
about it in the future,

10:21.154 --> 10:24.489
but it's the future now,
bec, and I want kids.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.991
You know what, we're gonna

10:25.993 --> 10:28.226
go grab another drink
at the bar.
Okay.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.794
...And see how the fans...

10:29.796 --> 10:31.096
Let's go to the ginger man
and Paul hornung.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.831
L.A. fans have
to be happy, Paul.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.165
<i> Bedtimes are at 8:00</i>

10:34.167 --> 10:36.501
and 9:00-- that's teeth
brushed, in the bed.

10:36.503 --> 10:39.070
8:00 and 9:00.
So one Sambuca
to chase down the Ambien,

10:39.072 --> 10:40.305
and then lights out, right?

10:41.341 --> 10:42.741
That's too far.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.075
Okay, listen, relax.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.176
We're gonna have a nice,

10:45.178 --> 10:46.311
quiet evening at home. Okay?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.912
The girls are gonna play.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.581
I'm gonna memorize my lines
and get off book.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.516
Look, we want to make it clear
that we're not normally

10:51.518 --> 10:53.118
in the habit of leaving
the girls overnight.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.420
Let alone with two men
who probably haven't been

10:55.422 --> 10:56.454
around kids that much.

10:56.456 --> 10:57.789
One of them's best known

10:57.791 --> 10:59.591
for leaving a kid
at a fire station.

10:59.593 --> 11:00.959
Oh, my God, please,
take care of my babies.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.494
And, please, don't call us.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.162
No, no, call us if you need us.
But don't need us.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.497
Oh, one more thing,
though, before you go.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.831
So, Tess was the, uh,

11:06.833 --> 11:08.466
the white wine drinker, right?

11:08.468 --> 11:10.368
Annie likes the red
'cause I don't get that wrong.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.137
Piss them off.
- Thanks.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.838
It's still too far.
I can tell by the way you...

11:13.840 --> 11:15.040
Yes.
It's a little too far.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.508
He plays too much.
It's okay.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.809
It's okay.
He plays too much.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.177
Hey, call us if
you need anything.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.079
Don't call us.

11:23.116 --> 11:27.619
So, I have, you know, this-this
issue with-with cracker control,

11:27.621 --> 11:29.854
so what I've been finding
to be really helpful

11:29.856 --> 11:31.489
Is if I...

11:31.491 --> 11:32.657
Take the portion

11:32.659 --> 11:34.059
out of the box

11:34.061 --> 11:36.628
and then I put the portion
onto the plate

11:36.630 --> 11:37.529
and then I put the box
- Just pass it.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.798
Away... and then I know...

11:39.800 --> 11:42.667
How... how many crackers

11:42.669 --> 11:44.736
I'm allowed to-to have.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.204
Just pass it.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.073
To h... to have,

11:48.075 --> 11:50.075
so then I know that if-if
I'm only allowed

11:50.077 --> 11:51.843
to have ten crackers,

11:51.845 --> 11:53.311
then I have the ten
crackers on my plate,

11:53.313 --> 11:55.480
which is fine,
but at the same time,

11:55.482 --> 11:57.716
there are other crackers
that I like than-than

11:57.718 --> 11:59.184
other crackers.
So, I might not like

11:59.186 --> 12:00.985
saltine crackers
as much as I like

12:00.987 --> 12:01.986
a cheez-it type cracker,

12:01.988 --> 12:04.422
but so, what I'll do

12:04.424 --> 12:05.857
with the cheez-it
type cracker

12:05.859 --> 12:08.093
is maybe put a little bit
more on the plate,

12:08.095 --> 12:10.161
but I'm still rationing,
so if I have a saltine,

12:10.163 --> 12:12.063
then I might put
ten on the plate,

12:12.065 --> 12:13.832
but there might be 20
if it's a cheez-it.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.667
But I still put the box away.
So, i-i mean

12:15.669 --> 12:17.068
i-i think that's...
That's a win.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.137
Yeah.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.950
She was always away on business.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.753
So, I was used to being alone
but this, you know, this...

12:34.755 --> 12:36.721
But this was a different kind
of alone. She was always away

12:36.723 --> 12:38.723
on business, so i
was used to being...

12:38.725 --> 12:41.259
But...
So, I was...

12:41.261 --> 12:42.794
She was always away on business,
so I was used to being alone,

12:42.796 --> 12:44.395
but this was a different
kind of alone.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.397
You know? This-this...
Is a different kind of...

12:46.399 --> 12:47.365
I thought you two
were watching a movie.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.466
We want to have

12:48.468 --> 12:49.868
a Barbie fashion show.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.202
Oh, cool.
That sounds fun.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.771
So, go play Barbie
fashion show.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.973
We need you to be
the celebrity judge.

12:54.975 --> 12:55.974
Right.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.143
Uh, the thing is I can't

12:58.145 --> 12:59.878
because I got this
rehearsal tomorrow

12:59.880 --> 13:01.212
and I really want
to be off book, so...

13:01.214 --> 13:02.380
What does "off book" mean?

13:02.382 --> 13:04.048
Off book. Off book means, uh,

13:04.050 --> 13:05.216
means that I know my lines.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.918
So, uh, you, uh...

13:06.920 --> 13:08.153
Have grandpa
be the judge.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.721
Grandpa's not
a celebrity.

13:09.723 --> 13:10.722
Yeah.

13:10.724 --> 13:13.458
Their logic seems sound.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.660
Thank you.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.396
Okay. Um... tell you what?
You want to,

13:18.398 --> 13:19.397
you want to help me?
You want to,

13:19.399 --> 13:20.565
you want to read
the play with me?

13:20.567 --> 13:21.833
Okay.
Yeah. Oh,
come on.

13:21.835 --> 13:22.834
Okay.
Yeah, let's do that.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.302
Come on, over here. William,

13:24.304 --> 13:25.603
let's do it.
I'm not much of an actor.

13:25.605 --> 13:26.638
Oh, doesn't matter. I just need

13:26.640 --> 13:28.406
to get the lines down, so...

13:28.408 --> 13:30.074
All right, Tess,
we'll start with you.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.744
Uh, you're gonna be Jessica,
David's wife.

13:32.746 --> 13:34.946
Why does she get
to be Jessica?

13:34.948 --> 13:36.614
Well, um, be...

13:36.616 --> 13:38.950
Oh, because you're Gracie, okay?

13:38.952 --> 13:40.985
Gracie's Jessica's mom,
which is kind of cool.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.453
It means you get to boss your
sister around.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.922
How's that sound?

13:43.924 --> 13:46.658
So. William, multiple questions.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.092
First one,
I'm not gonna lie to you,

13:48.094 --> 13:50.562
it's a little
delicate.
Go ahead.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.431
Do you know how to read?

13:53.433 --> 13:55.867
Yes, I can read.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.002
I knew it. I was joking.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.771
Of course you know how to read.

13:59.773 --> 14:01.940
Trying to be funny.
Okay. So if you

14:01.942 --> 14:05.210
could please read
the role of Brad.

14:05.212 --> 14:08.012
Terrific, okay.
Whoa, where we going?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.347
I have to pee.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.282
Oh, I kind of do, too.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.384
What are you... oh, good God.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.763
Mm.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.505
Now, this is what

14:34.507 --> 14:36.708
I'm talking about.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.176
Okay, babe,
here's the plan.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.510
Sex first.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.912
Right away.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.513
Loud, adult,

14:42.515 --> 14:44.249
no kids in the next room sex.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.417
And it doesn't have to be
marathon sex.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.587
We just need
to get the job done.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.090
And under no circumstances
are we allowed

14:52.092 --> 14:54.259
to fall asleep afterwards
watching <i> house hunters.</i>

14:54.261 --> 14:57.195
Don't want to miss the whole
night sleeping. Right?

14:57.197 --> 14:58.930
Ooh.

14:58.932 --> 15:01.366
We'll do it
in the shower.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.867
That's good.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.869
Won't fall asleep
in the big fancy shower.

15:04.871 --> 15:08.373
And we'll order
room service before.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.542
That way we will finish
our loud adult shower sex

15:11.544 --> 15:14.579
just as room service arrives
and we will slip on robes

15:14.581 --> 15:17.382
and eat burgers...
No, wait-- spaghetti.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.017
No, I like burgers better.

15:19.019 --> 15:22.253
We will eat burgers in bed.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.088
Ooh.

15:24.090 --> 15:27.058
Oh. Now, the big question is...

15:27.060 --> 15:30.094
What to order on pay-per-view.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.630
Oh, I already hope they,
uh, I hope they have that

15:32.632 --> 15:35.300
huge grant-meryl streep movie
that sounds like a black lady.

15:35.302 --> 15:38.102
Come on.
<i> Florence foster Jenkins.</i>

15:38.104 --> 15:40.038
Baby, they already got
<i> Florence foster Jenkins.</i>

15:40.040 --> 15:41.439
I'm late.

15:45.879 --> 15:49.213
I'm a week and a half late,
Randall,

15:49.215 --> 15:51.983
and I feel like crap.

15:51.985 --> 15:55.053
And I was chewing on ice
all day yesterday

15:55.055 --> 15:57.488
and I almost threw up
when I looked at pizza

15:57.490 --> 16:00.425
and I cannot bring myself
to go to the drugstore

16:00.427 --> 16:02.794
and get a pregnancy test.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.897
I'm bugging out, baby.

16:05.899 --> 16:08.733
I need you to talk me down.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.569
Oh.

16:11.571 --> 16:12.770
Hey, how are you?
Hey, good.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.772
Come on in.
We got carrots, celery,

16:14.774 --> 16:16.975
broccoli, no dip.
You're welcome.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.643
Thank you, that's so nice.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.645
Oh, and, uh, Kate,
this is my good friend, shooter.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.947
Shooter, Kate.
Hey.

16:22.949 --> 16:26.084
Nice to finally meet you, Kate.
Hi. Nice to meet you, too.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.286
Great news.
You both love sports, so...

16:28.288 --> 16:30.488
Sports party.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.958
...And the Kansas City chiefs
on <i> Sunday night football.</i>

16:33.960 --> 16:35.793
Bradshaw drops back.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.528
Bradshaw's got time...

16:41.001 --> 16:42.767
So, what do you think, Jack?

16:42.769 --> 16:44.569
Looking like it's gonna come
down to the fourth quarter.

16:50.043 --> 16:53.978
You want to do this now?
Okay. Let's do it.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.481
So...

16:56.483 --> 16:59.650
I am not enough for you.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.886
Am I not enough
for you, Jack?

17:01.888 --> 17:03.821
Okay, back to the bar?
Yup.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.990
I never said that. I just meant

17:05.992 --> 17:08.659
we need to have this
conversation at some point.
Okay.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.962
And you want to do that
right now, at froggy's

17:10.964 --> 17:13.031
during the super bowl?
Yes, please
don't make us

17:13.032 --> 17:15.532
miss a second of your drama.
Could you butt out?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.136
Hey...

17:18.137 --> 17:20.070
Babe,

17:20.073 --> 17:22.205
<i> we</i> joke about it.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.308
<i>We</i> see people with kids and go,

17:24.310 --> 17:25.742
"oh, thank God that's not us."

17:25.744 --> 17:27.811
<i> We</i> joke about
it. Right?

17:27.814 --> 17:29.380
Did I not
get the joke?

17:29.382 --> 17:31.049
I'm not...

17:31.051 --> 17:32.483
Babe, you're right.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.918
You are right.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.354
And coming from the family
that-that I did,

17:36.356 --> 17:39.023
I definitely never
saw myself having kids.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.492
Okay.
But then I met you.

17:41.494 --> 17:45.196
And, you know,
we're j... we're great together

17:45.198 --> 17:47.765
and I love our life.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.667
But the older we get,

17:49.669 --> 17:51.836
the more I think that...

17:51.838 --> 17:54.105
The more I think there's
got to be something bigger

17:54.107 --> 17:58.009
than just me and you.

17:58.011 --> 18:00.511
Well, thank you very much
for involving me

18:00.513 --> 18:04.348
in this huge
invisible change of yours. Huge.

18:04.350 --> 18:07.085
Because you knew when you met me
and married me

18:07.087 --> 18:09.520
that I did not want to be
one of those women

18:09.522 --> 18:11.522
whose sole purpose in life
was to be a mother.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.692
If that's what you wanted,
you should have married my mom.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.761
I was thinking more your sister.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.596
Oh. You probably were.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.133
I'm... it's a bad joke.
I'm not there yet, Jack.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.035
I'm not there yet.

18:24.037 --> 18:27.105
I am only 29.
Almost 30.

18:27.107 --> 18:30.475
I know how old I am!
Hey, sid and Nancy, will
you two take it outside?

18:30.477 --> 18:32.410
Could you just shut up
for a second?
Mind your business.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.278
None of us can hear the game
over your mouth.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.880
Wow.
You got to learn
some manners, pal.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.582
You need to control your woman.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.217
You need to watch your mouth.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.718
Jack, sit down.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.719
Come here.
It's not

18:41.721 --> 18:42.720
worth it.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.388
Jack, sit down, please.

18:44.390 --> 18:45.723
Jack.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.660
God, Jack.
Jack! Jack.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.462
No! No, no, no, no.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.933
Yeah,

18:55.935 --> 18:57.235
we should really be having kids.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.493
Aren't you gonna
say anything?

19:25.932 --> 19:29.700
Uh, yeah. Like, how?

19:29.702 --> 19:32.436
You take the pill every day
like clockwork, right?
Yeah.

19:32.438 --> 19:34.372
What, did I accidentally drop
one in my shake or something?

19:34.374 --> 19:36.307
No. I...

19:36.309 --> 19:37.842
I mean, I changed
medications last month

19:37.844 --> 19:39.844
and there might have been,
like, a brief window.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.078
A brief window?

19:42.482 --> 19:43.881
Sorry.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.516
A brief window, Beth?

19:45.518 --> 19:47.118
Did it not occur to you that
that might be something

19:47.120 --> 19:48.553
you want to run by your husband?
Well,

19:48.555 --> 19:49.554
I didn't know it was
gonna be a problem.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.689
Well, there goes Charleston.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.525
Okay, I'm sorry, what?

19:54.527 --> 19:57.128
Ten years from now, when the
girls are both off at college,

19:57.130 --> 20:00.298
I thought that we would take an
early retirement in Charleston.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.200
Oh, forgive me, Randall,

20:02.202 --> 20:04.068
but what in the holy hell
are you talking about?

20:04.070 --> 20:05.736
Since when do you want
to move to Charleston?

20:05.738 --> 20:07.738
I saw something about it
on CNN.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.974
Like, they got a great quality
of life, good restaurants.

20:11.678 --> 20:14.979
Sometimes at work,
i look up places on zillow.

20:14.981 --> 20:18.649
Oh, okay. Well, I'm so sorry
that I'm screwing with

20:18.651 --> 20:20.651
your super top secret
Charleston dream, honey.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.887
No, my issues are nothing
compared to yours.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.189
Nobody's saying that.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
here's a riddle--

20:25.191 --> 20:28.526
who has two hands and was about
to go back to work full-time

20:28.528 --> 20:30.528
and maybe,<i> maybe... </i>
Start to remember who she was?

20:30.530 --> 20:32.029
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.698
But now will
have to split her time

20:33.700 --> 20:37.535
between a diaper station
and a home office?

20:37.537 --> 20:39.537
This girl, right here.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.339
It's two thumbs.
What?

20:41.341 --> 20:43.040
You're doing it wrong.
You're supposed to say

20:43.042 --> 20:44.742
"what has two thumbs and is
mm-mmm, mm-mmm.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.910
Gonna be splitting
time betw..."
Shut up.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.912
Okay, that's real nice, Beth.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.849
Hey.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.818
Also, some altoids.
Please.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.887
Look at that picture.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.522
That is a vivid picture.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.124
I feel like I'm at the game.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.927
Over across the field, here.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.029
Yeah. It's a really nice TV...

21:05.031 --> 21:06.397
What is this?

21:06.399 --> 21:07.898
Plasma?

21:07.900 --> 21:09.200
Led?

21:09.202 --> 21:11.402
You know, I'm really
not sure, but...

21:11.404 --> 21:12.403
Hey, Toby!

21:12.405 --> 21:13.404
Yeah?

21:13.406 --> 21:14.472
Uh, do you guys like

21:14.474 --> 21:16.274
jicama?
Plasma or led?

21:16.276 --> 21:18.209
I...

21:18.211 --> 21:19.910
Have no idea.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.078
Kate? Jicama?
What?

21:21.080 --> 21:22.313
Is that a vegetable or a fruit?

21:22.315 --> 21:25.116
Can... can you actually
just move, tob?

21:25.118 --> 21:27.218
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep.

21:27.220 --> 21:29.153
The receiver's all set.

21:29.155 --> 21:31.455
To the right,
Ben looks straight

21:31.457 --> 21:33.457
over the middle,
and going for the end zone!

21:33.459 --> 21:34.492
Hey.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.060
Shooter, uh, tell Kate

21:36.062 --> 21:37.495
about that time we accidentally

21:37.497 --> 21:39.597
went to an
Ashlee Simpson concert.

21:39.599 --> 21:40.731
Oh...

21:40.733 --> 21:41.999
Uh, you got to hear this.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.234
So, we were trying to...
I'm sorry.

21:43.236 --> 21:44.435
Toby, you paused the TV.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.670
It's like, paused.

21:45.672 --> 21:46.971
Yeah, just for a second.
Listen to this.

21:46.973 --> 21:47.972
No, this is a great story.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.607
No. O-okay,

21:49.609 --> 21:51.575
I know it's not a big deal,
really,

21:51.577 --> 21:53.244
but I kind of like to
watch sports

21:53.246 --> 21:54.345
as they happen live.

21:54.347 --> 21:55.746
Probably just me, right?

21:55.748 --> 21:57.682
Okay. Okay. Here we go.
I don't know.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.684
...Tends to wait...
- Now we're behind the game!

21:59.686 --> 22:01.352
Fast forward it!

22:01.354 --> 22:03.854
Touch down!

22:03.856 --> 22:05.990
And heyward made it all alone
down the left side...

22:05.992 --> 22:06.857
That's great.
That's your team, right?

22:06.859 --> 22:07.858
That's my fantasy team.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.327
What's that?
You know what,

22:09.329 --> 22:10.494
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

22:10.496 --> 22:11.696
I'm actually not feeling good.

22:11.698 --> 22:12.863
I'm gonna go
ahead and go.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.265
Oh, no!
Yeah...

22:14.267 --> 22:15.266
Are you sure?

22:15.268 --> 22:16.534
Yeah.
No, Kate, stay.

22:16.536 --> 22:17.802
Shooter...

22:17.804 --> 22:19.370
It was really nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

22:19.372 --> 22:20.604
What... wait, wait, wait.
Seriously,

22:20.606 --> 22:21.839
thank you for the jicama.
What...

22:21.841 --> 22:23.040
I'll talk to you later.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.443
What is happening?

22:25.445 --> 22:26.844
You have to let her go, David.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.112
This is crazy, man.

22:28.114 --> 22:29.947
She's gone and she's never
coming back.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.650
Whew.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.285
You really never acted before?

22:34.287 --> 22:35.453
Nope.

22:35.455 --> 22:36.487
Voice like silk.

22:36.489 --> 22:39.190
Yeah.

22:39.192 --> 22:42.526
How am I supposed to move on,
David?

22:42.528 --> 22:43.828
No. I'm David.

22:43.830 --> 22:46.030
How am I supposed to
move on, Brad?

22:46.032 --> 22:48.532
And who made you the expert
of moving on?

22:48.534 --> 22:50.468
Or the expert of anything
for that matter?

22:51.571 --> 22:53.437
Is that how you're gonna do it?

22:54.507 --> 22:55.906
No.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.208
Good.

22:58.244 --> 22:59.643
It's your line. Uh,

22:59.645 --> 23:00.911
Tess, honey, you have
the next line,
uh...

23:00.913 --> 23:02.813
Pay attention.
I-I'd rather

23:02.815 --> 23:04.315
you not move on. I'm--

23:04.317 --> 23:07.551
I'm obv-- I'm obviously
not planning to.

23:07.553 --> 23:08.652
It's not good.

23:08.654 --> 23:10.054
Not as easy
as it looks, is it?

23:10.056 --> 23:11.422
No.
No. Okay.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.224
There she is! Do you see her?

23:13.226 --> 23:14.692
Who, David?
Did I see who?

23:14.694 --> 23:15.893
Her! She's right there.

23:15.895 --> 23:16.894
And ever since she died,

23:16.896 --> 23:18.062
her ghost has been haunting me.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.430
Hold up.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.732
What's the matter, sweetheart?

23:21.734 --> 23:23.834
What's happening
in this story?

23:23.836 --> 23:25.936
You're not following the story?

23:27.673 --> 23:30.007
Do you follow it?

23:30.009 --> 23:31.709
Of course.
Yes, of course I follow it.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.043
Um...

23:33.045 --> 23:34.378
Mm-hmm.
She died, right?

23:34.380 --> 23:35.513
She's dead.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.348
But she keeps coming back
as a ghost.

23:37.350 --> 23:39.517
So when you die
you become a ghost?

23:39.519 --> 23:41.085
No.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.754
No, no, no, no, no. No.
Sweetheart, ghosts aren't real.

23:43.756 --> 23:47.291
So what happens when you die?

23:50.062 --> 23:52.229
What happens when you die?

23:52.231 --> 23:55.966
Uh, is... you die.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.601
Forever?

23:57.603 --> 24:00.037
Sure... or not.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.206
I don't know. Honey,
here's the thing, you know,

24:02.208 --> 24:04.408
do we want ghosts or do we not
want ghosts? Because I can...

24:04.410 --> 24:07.111
Grandpa takes pills
because he's sick,

24:07.113 --> 24:09.046
is grandpa gonna die?

24:09.048 --> 24:11.015
Why are you asking me this?

24:12.819 --> 24:14.285
Yes? Yes.

24:14.287 --> 24:15.719
Soon?

24:15.721 --> 24:17.621
Well, you know, I mean,

24:17.623 --> 24:19.123
I wouldn't get too attached
if I were you, so...

24:20.293 --> 24:21.892
No! No, no, no.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.561
That's not what I meant.
Look, i-i mean, I meant it,

24:23.563 --> 24:25.229
but I was trying to be fun...
It was a joke, okay?

24:25.231 --> 24:27.798
Here's the thing about death,
is that it's natural.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.234
It's just natural.
I'm gonna die, okay?

24:30.236 --> 24:32.169
You two? You're gonna die.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.772
Mommy and daddy
are gonna die.

24:34.774 --> 24:37.174
Mommy and daddy are gonna die?
- No. Uh...

24:37.176 --> 24:39.009
Look, uh, oh, my gosh, wil...
It is getting late.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.277
It's bedtime, girls.

24:40.279 --> 24:41.846
- Come on, girls.
- Yep.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.147
Time to go to bed.
Uh, sleep tight.

24:44.484 --> 24:45.916
Thanks for
all the help.

24:45.918 --> 24:49.420
Don't forget to
brush your teeth.

24:56.596 --> 24:59.063
Wh-when did you guys know
you wanted kids?

25:01.434 --> 25:04.768
Uh, about, uh, four months
into her first pregnancy.

25:09.542 --> 25:12.009
Rebecca thinks
that if we have kids,

25:12.011 --> 25:13.544
our lives
are gonna be over.

25:13.546 --> 25:15.212
She's right, pal. Yeah.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.780
She's totally right.

25:16.782 --> 25:19.283
You can kiss
this life good-bye.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.886
Third and eight
for Pittsburgh and bradshaw.

25:23.823 --> 25:27.892
What if she
doesn't want kids?

25:27.894 --> 25:31.395
Is that really like a,
like a deal-breaker?

25:41.908 --> 25:43.307
Yeah!

25:43.309 --> 25:44.675
I got to go find Shelly.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.176
That over the wrong shoulder.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.512
That's one of the great catches
you'll ever see.

25:48.514 --> 25:51.482
73 yards.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.532
And the terrible towels
will come out

26:08.534 --> 26:09.934
throughout the rose bowl.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.202
Not much doubt
about the best team.

26:17.577 --> 26:18.776
<i> Just been informed</i>

26:18.778 --> 26:21.445
that the mvp for this contest

26:21.447 --> 26:23.280
as picked by <i> sport magazine</i>

26:23.282 --> 26:26.517
and their panel of voters
is Terry bradshaw.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.766
This isn't the night
i had planned.

26:42.768 --> 26:45.703
I know.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.306
Shall we look?

26:49.308 --> 26:51.875
Wait. Just, um,
let's... let's...

26:51.877 --> 26:55.279
Let's give it like,
30 more seconds.

26:55.281 --> 26:58.282
Okay.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.820
You'll still be
able to work more.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.321
I can work less.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.589
We'll get a nanny.

27:05.591 --> 27:06.790
Or a Manny.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.560
God, no.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.896
You know,
if you still want

27:12.898 --> 27:15.165
that vacation house
you can...
I don't.

27:15.167 --> 27:16.900
It's too much trouble.

27:16.902 --> 27:18.902
Worrying
about hurricanes

27:18.904 --> 27:22.072
and whether or not it gets
broken into by some kids

27:22.074 --> 27:24.408
using it for their
who knows what?

27:24.410 --> 27:28.646
Damn South Carolina
punk-ass kids.

27:34.120 --> 27:39.123
You know, a son
wouldn't totally suck.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.358
We do make good kids.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.029
That we do,
that we do.

27:46.632 --> 27:48.132
The girls will love it.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.334
Oh, they'll go nuts.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.806
Hey.
Hmm?

27:55.808 --> 27:57.541
What has two thumbs

27:57.543 --> 28:00.444
and loves his wife
so much it hurts?

28:02.314 --> 28:04.615
Oh, it does work better
with two thumbs.

28:04.617 --> 28:06.650
Nah. I like the
way you do it.

28:06.652 --> 28:11.221
Mm. Well...
I like your face.

28:13.459 --> 28:17.194
Shall we do this?

28:28.207 --> 28:30.774
Well, that conversation
went sideways, didn't it?

28:32.411 --> 28:35.145
Randall's gonna punch me
for that conversation.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.513
I got to go talk
to the girls.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.582
Go talk to the girls--
what am I gonna say?

28:38.584 --> 28:40.484
You know, I am
clearly not the man

28:40.486 --> 28:41.985
that needs to be
talking to them

28:41.987 --> 28:43.687
about the intricacies
of life and death.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.422
It's...

28:45.424 --> 28:47.658
Ah.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.764
You do that a lot.

28:53.766 --> 28:55.599
I do what a lot?

28:55.601 --> 28:58.102
Doubt yourself.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.741
You were very good, Kevin.

29:03.743 --> 29:05.609
On that show.

29:08.781 --> 29:10.247
You watched <i> the Manny?</i>

29:10.249 --> 29:13.117
Before I came here,
i had one old television,

29:13.119 --> 29:15.018
got three channels.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.254
I really liked that program.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.224
And I remember thinking,
he's very talented.

29:20.226 --> 29:23.761
I liked the one where
you lose the baby.

29:23.763 --> 29:24.928
Oh, geez.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.296
"Manny on fire."
Yeah, yeah.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.598
Yeah, no.
That was a...

29:27.600 --> 29:28.932
That was a
strong episode.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.034
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

29:31.036 --> 29:33.437
Yeah.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.607
Yeah. I never should
have left that show.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.442
I've...

29:38.444 --> 29:40.978
I never should have come
here, that's for sure.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.380
Being an Uncle, right,
doing theater...

29:43.382 --> 29:44.782
I... I...

29:44.784 --> 29:46.984
I'm not cut
out for theater.

29:46.986 --> 29:50.120
And there you go again.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.323
Well, yeah, I mean, that's
easy for you to say, right?

29:53.325 --> 29:55.559
You're the wise owl
in a pixar film.

29:55.561 --> 29:58.462
I'm the dopey labrador.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.731
I'm a dying
recovering addict.

30:00.733 --> 30:02.099
Yeah, whatever.
Yeah, well,

30:02.101 --> 30:04.067
people love labradors.

30:04.069 --> 30:06.703
Said the wise owl.

30:12.111 --> 30:13.443
You want to know
what it is?

30:13.445 --> 30:14.945
It's this play, right?

30:14.947 --> 30:17.247
I mean, these people
that I'm working with,

30:17.249 --> 30:20.150
wow, they're like
next level smart.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.685
I mean, uh,
they're brilliant.

30:21.687 --> 30:24.121
And then they look at me
like I'm a joke, right?

30:24.123 --> 30:26.089
Which makes me start to
think that I am a joke,

30:26.091 --> 30:28.025
and then I start spinning.

30:28.027 --> 30:29.760
I don't even know what
the play's about anymore.

30:29.762 --> 30:33.664
Kevin, what did you think it was
about when you first read it?

30:39.538 --> 30:42.039
You know, it doesn't ma--
it doesn't matter, it's...

30:42.041 --> 30:43.440
You're just gonna
think it's stupid.

30:43.442 --> 30:46.877
Said the dopey labrador.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.661
We did it!

31:07.833 --> 31:12.002
If it's between you
and having kids, you win.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.004
Every time.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.406
No question.

31:23.215 --> 31:26.550
My father,

31:26.552 --> 31:29.987
he loved football
more than anything.

31:29.989 --> 31:32.990
Most of the time,
he-he pretty much

31:32.992 --> 31:34.992
didn't want anything
to do with me.

31:34.994 --> 31:39.329
But... if he was watching
football,

31:39.331 --> 31:41.164
he let me sit

31:41.166 --> 31:44.568
and watch the game with him.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.237
As long as I'd sit on the floor

31:47.239 --> 31:50.641
and I didn't talk too much.

31:54.947 --> 31:58.048
I always imagined
that when I had kids

31:58.050 --> 32:02.019
that I'd watch the games
with them, too.

32:04.056 --> 32:07.791
Except i-I'd let them talk...

32:07.793 --> 32:10.961
As loud as they wanted.

32:15.868 --> 32:18.602
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.804
God, there's nothing wrong
with you, bec.

32:20.806 --> 32:23.473
All of my friends my age
have kids.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.742
Every single one of them.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.412
And...

32:28.414 --> 32:31.148
Maybe it's 'cause
I'm still singing at froggy's

32:31.150 --> 32:33.817
and I'm not as far along
as I thought I would be.

32:33.819 --> 32:36.153
I don't know.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.922
'Cause the truth is,
when I close my eyes

32:38.924 --> 32:42.659
and I think about our future...

32:42.661 --> 32:45.929
I see us with kids, Jack.

32:45.931 --> 32:49.066
Yeah.

32:49.068 --> 32:52.302
I just...

32:52.304 --> 32:55.305
I love our life.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.976
I love it right now.

32:58.978 --> 33:03.146
And I'm <i> so</i> scared
of changing it.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.148
I don't want to change it.

33:05.150 --> 33:09.319
Okay? I'm not gonna stand for
anything changing between us.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.089
Okay? What we have together,
you and me.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.024
Nothing.

33:18.964 --> 33:22.165
Look, I'm sorry about
pressuring you all day.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.334
I just...

33:24.336 --> 33:27.337
I just want you.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.252
The steelers won the super bowl.

33:43.322 --> 33:46.323
Steelers won the super bowl.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.494
Bradshaw won mvp.

33:50.496 --> 33:53.130
My man.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.132
Yes.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.467
I am.

33:57.469 --> 34:00.103
You are.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.856
hey.

34:19.858 --> 34:21.425
Hey.
Okay.

34:21.427 --> 34:24.027
So, uh...

34:24.029 --> 34:26.530
What was all that about today?

34:26.532 --> 34:29.399
I told you I wanted to watch
the game by myself.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.835
Then why did you agree
to come over?

34:32.905 --> 34:34.170
I don't know.

34:34.172 --> 34:36.172
'Cause I didn't want to...

34:36.175 --> 34:38.608
Seem like a weirdo.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.543
Okay. So, now I know.

34:40.545 --> 34:42.545
No hanging out on Sundays
during football season.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.380
I got it.
But it's not
just about football.

34:44.382 --> 34:47.150
Okay. What's it about then?

34:48.219 --> 34:51.721
Okay. So, growing up,

34:51.723 --> 34:54.724
I used to watch the steelers
with my dad.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.960
Right? Every single Sunday,

34:56.962 --> 34:59.629
until I grew up and...

34:59.631 --> 35:03.066
I moved out here
and I just got out of the habit.

35:03.068 --> 35:05.969
It wasn't
until the 2006 afc championship

35:05.971 --> 35:07.804
when they played the broncos.
Do you remember?

35:07.806 --> 35:09.639
No.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.643
Okay. Anyway,

35:13.645 --> 35:17.080
I wanted to watch 'em
with my dad.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.250
And I did. And they won.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.818
And then they won
the super bowl.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.588
And I just...

35:24.590 --> 35:27.491
It's just-just what I do now.

35:27.493 --> 35:29.493
I watch the steelers, and...

35:29.495 --> 35:32.129
I watch 'em with my dad.

35:33.165 --> 35:34.931
He sounds like a cool guy.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.333
I'd like to meet him sometime.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.767
Yeah.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.102
Okay.

35:39.104 --> 35:40.770
Yeah.

35:40.772 --> 35:43.006
Okay.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.941
Um...
All right.

35:44.943 --> 35:47.777
And I know it's gonna be
a little creepy.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.679
Uh...

35:51.683 --> 35:54.784
This is your dad?

35:57.990 --> 36:00.323
Jack.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.027
Wow.

36:04.029 --> 36:07.797
I know it sounds crazy and lame,

36:07.799 --> 36:09.599
but football is

36:09.601 --> 36:12.869
<i>a really big part of my family.</i>
<i> Like, really big.</i>

36:12.871 --> 36:14.371
<i> Like, I wouldn't even be here</i>
<i> if it wasn't for football.</i>

36:14.373 --> 36:16.306
<i> I was conceived</i>

36:16.308 --> 36:18.708
<i> in a bathroom</i>
<i> during the super bowl.</i>

36:32.457 --> 36:34.457
Hi.

36:34.459 --> 36:37.894
Sorry if I was a jerk before.

36:41.133 --> 36:44.134
You're really
not gonna forgive me?

36:44.136 --> 36:46.136
Okay.

36:46.138 --> 36:48.538
Um...

36:48.540 --> 36:51.474
What if I told you a-a secret

36:51.476 --> 36:54.144
that I've never shared
with anyone before?

36:54.146 --> 36:56.146
Hmm?
We're listening.

36:56.148 --> 36:57.814
Okay. All right.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.983
But you got to promise
not to tell anyone though, okay?

36:59.985 --> 37:02.052
This is a very private thing
that I'm sharing with you.

37:02.054 --> 37:04.054
Is this about you dating
demi lovato?

37:04.056 --> 37:05.855
Because everyone knows.

37:05.857 --> 37:08.558
No. You know what,
it's not about demi lovato,

37:08.560 --> 37:10.727
and we were just
friends. I just...

37:12.998 --> 37:15.765
Sometimes I... paint.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.101
Now, no one knows this,
not even your aunt Kate,

37:18.103 --> 37:21.271
but... when I get a script,
the first thing I do

37:21.273 --> 37:24.674
is just sort of paint
the way it makes me feel.

37:27.179 --> 37:29.479
Um...

37:31.183 --> 37:33.183
I painted this

37:33.185 --> 37:36.019
after I read that play
for the first time.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.320
So...

37:46.198 --> 37:48.198
I think I scared you before.

37:48.200 --> 37:52.569
Um, all that talk of ghosts
and dying.

37:52.571 --> 37:54.804
All that adult stuff
we were reading about.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.806
That's some pretty
confusing adult stuff.

37:56.808 --> 37:59.409
So, uh, you know,

37:59.411 --> 38:01.578
I thought I would come up
here, show you my painting,

38:01.580 --> 38:04.381
tell you what I think
my play is about.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.883
Because I was thinking, um,

38:06.885 --> 38:11.054
that it might make us all feel
a little bit better.

38:11.056 --> 38:14.658
But you got to promise
not to make fun of me, okay?

38:17.062 --> 38:19.729
So, um...

38:19.731 --> 38:22.132
Yeah, I painted this
because I felt like the play

38:22.134 --> 38:23.733
was about life, you know?

38:23.735 --> 38:25.468
And life is full of color.

38:25.470 --> 38:26.903
And we each get to come along

38:26.905 --> 38:28.938
and we add our own color
to the painting.

38:28.940 --> 38:32.909
You know? And even though
it's not very big, the painting,

38:32.911 --> 38:34.744
you sort of have to figure
that it goes on forever,

38:34.746 --> 38:37.480
you know, in each direction.
So, like, to infinity, you know?

38:37.482 --> 38:39.649
'Cause that's kind
of like life, right?

38:39.651 --> 38:42.485
<i> And it's really crazy, if</i>
<i> you think about it, isn't it,</i>

38:42.487 --> 38:44.421
<i> that, a hundred years ago,</i>
<i> some guy</i>

38:44.423 --> 38:47.257
<i> that I never met came to</i>
<i> this country with a suitcase.</i>

38:53.865 --> 38:56.433
<i> he has a son,</i>

38:56.435 --> 39:00.136
<i> who has a son,</i>

39:00.138 --> 39:02.439
<i> who has me.</i>

39:02.441 --> 39:05.041
So, at first, when I was
painting, I was thinking,
you know, maybe up here,

39:05.043 --> 39:07.277
that was that guy's part of
the painting and then, you know,

39:07.279 --> 39:09.279
down here,
that's my part of the painting.

39:09.281 --> 39:11.481
And then I started to
think, well, what if...

39:11.483 --> 39:13.717
We're all in the painting,
everywhere?

39:13.719 --> 39:16.886
<i> And-and what if we're in</i>
<i>the painting before we're born?</i>

39:16.888 --> 39:21.891
<i> What if we're in it</i>
<i> after we die?</i>

39:21.893 --> 39:23.993
<i> And these colors</i>
<i> that we keep adding,</i>

39:23.995 --> 39:26.996
<i> what if they just keep getting</i>
<i> added on top of one another,</i>

39:26.998 --> 39:31.401
<i> until eventually we're not</i>
<i> even different colors anymore?</i>

39:31.403 --> 39:34.337
<i> We're just... one thing.</i>

39:34.339 --> 39:37.140
<i> One painting.</i>

39:39.077 --> 39:40.643
lucky cap.
Lucky cap.

39:46.051 --> 39:50.053
<i> I mean, my dad</i>
<i> is not with us anymore.</i>

39:50.055 --> 39:52.489
<i> He's not alive,</i>
<i> but he's with us.</i>

39:54.493 --> 39:56.760
<i> He's with me every day.</i>

39:59.264 --> 40:01.264
<i> it all just sort of fits</i>
<i> somehow.</i>

40:01.266 --> 40:04.033
<i> And even if you don't</i>
<i> understand how yet,</i>

<i> people will die</i>

40:06.204 --> 40:08.371
in our lives,
people that we love.

40:08.373 --> 40:09.606
<i> In the future.</i>

40:09.608 --> 40:11.207
<i> Maybe tomorrow.</i>

40:11.209 --> 40:13.042
<i> Maybe years from now.</i>

40:13.044 --> 40:14.711
<i>I mean, it's kind of beautiful,</i>
<i> right,</i>

40:14.713 --> 40:16.446
<i> if you think about it,</i>
<i> the fact that just because</i>

40:16.448 --> 40:18.047
<i> someone dies,</i>
<i>just because you can't see them</i>

40:18.049 --> 40:20.216
<i> or talk to them anymore,</i>

40:20.218 --> 40:23.386
<i> it doesn't mean they're</i>
<i> not still in the painting.</i>

40:23.388 --> 40:27.223
<i> I think maybe that's the point</i>
<i> of the whole thing.</i>

40:27.225 --> 40:30.393
<i> There's no dying.</i>

40:30.395 --> 40:33.797
<i> There's no you or me or them.</i>

40:33.799 --> 40:35.698
<i> It's just us.</i>

40:47.245 --> 40:50.213
and this... sloppy...

40:51.583 --> 40:53.583
...wild, colorful, magical thing

40:53.585 --> 40:55.618
that has no beginning,
it has no end...

41:00.625 --> 41:04.060
...this right here...

41:04.062 --> 41:06.996
I think it's us.
