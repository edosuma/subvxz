01:22.924 --> 01:25.467
AII right, Miss Smarty Pants.

01:25.468 --> 01:27.386
Now, Iet's see if you've
heard this one.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.847
I'm ready.
Hit me with your best.

01:29.848 --> 01:32.432
In the 1945 film
To Have and Have Not,

01:32.433 --> 01:36.103
Lauren Bacall sang the song
"How Little We Know."

01:36.104 --> 01:40.414
Now, her voice was dubbed
by what 14-year-old?

01:41.025 --> 01:43.652
- Andy Williams.
- Oh, how did you know that?

01:43.653 --> 01:46.113
Do you remember the dinner party
the Cornfields gave for you

01:46.114 --> 01:47.322
back in 1952?

01:47.323 --> 01:50.075
You'd just completed filming
The Duelling Swashbuckler.

01:50.076 --> 01:52.619
It was December the 12th, 1952.

01:52.620 --> 01:54.871
Right, darling.
You're absolutely right.

01:54.872 --> 01:57.082
Still sharp as a tack, huh?

01:57.083 --> 01:59.543
I met a young singer
at the Cornfields' that night,

01:59.544 --> 02:04.131
and he told me all about Andy Williams
dubbing Lauren Bacall's voice.

02:04.132 --> 02:07.717
Amazing.
You never forget anything, do you?

02:07.718 --> 02:09.845
By the way,
whatever became of the Cornfields?

02:09.846 --> 02:12.346
They died, dear.

02:13.182 --> 02:18.292
Well, the Iong habit of Iiving
indisposeth us for dying.

02:20.064 --> 02:23.324
- Sir Thomas Browne.
- Smarty pants.

02:27.905 --> 02:29.698
Look, Guy, there's a town up ahead.

02:29.699 --> 02:34.219
Mesa? I don't remember
seeing a Mesa on the map.

02:46.006 --> 02:48.800
Sometimes it's good
to get out of the big city,

02:48.801 --> 02:54.097
go somewhere where time
seems to move just a little slower.

02:54.098 --> 02:56.808
Take this vintage '59 Cadillac.

02:56.809 --> 03:02.230
It was built for cruising the road
and taking in the scenery.

03:02.231 --> 03:05.771
It's nice to know chivalry's not dead.

03:06.527 --> 03:10.321
Now, most people come to small
towns and leave their troubles behind.

03:10.322 --> 03:13.783
But when you're a member of the
syndicate, that isn't always easy.

03:13.784 --> 03:16.994
I guess that's why Tony Sullivan
asked me to meet him here.

03:16.995 --> 03:18.454
Something big
had to be going down.

03:18.455 --> 03:21.125
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey, MacGyver.

03:21.291 --> 03:23.209
- I owe you one.
- When you say

03:23.210 --> 03:25.711
in the middle of nowhere,
you mean nowhere, don't you?

03:25.712 --> 03:28.256
- A guy's gotta be careful these days.
- Good motto.

03:28.257 --> 03:30.757
I'II be right down.

03:32.761 --> 03:38.131
Hey, Tony, come here.
I wanna have a Iittle talk with you.

03:59.246 --> 04:01.746
Let's get out of here.

04:16.762 --> 04:18.805
Tony and I met years ago

04:18.807 --> 04:21.058
when he was running guns
into Afghanistan,

04:21.059 --> 04:23.686
and I was running for my life.

04:23.687 --> 04:27.731
In a one-week period,
he saved my neck twice.

04:27.732 --> 04:31.352
I'd kind of hoped to return the favour.

04:34.239 --> 04:36.281
MacGyver, if you never had
a chance to talk to him,

04:36.282 --> 04:40.452
I don't know what more you can do
there. Wrap it up. Come on home.

04:40.453 --> 04:43.038
Listen, Pete, Tony asked me
for protection for a reason,

04:43.039 --> 04:45.999
and it had to be pretty good
because it got him killed.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.501
I agree.

04:47.502 --> 04:49.962
But you were involved in this
because you were the only guy

04:49.963 --> 04:52.089
Tony would talk to,
and he's dead now.

04:52.090 --> 04:53.590
So it's the feds' ball game.

04:53.591 --> 04:55.884
Listen, are the Iocal police
into it at all?

04:55.885 --> 04:59.846
Yeah, I just spent the whole afternoon
explaining things. It's handled.

04:59.847 --> 05:01.640
I just wish there was
more I could do.

05:01.641 --> 05:03.433
Well, there isn't.

05:03.434 --> 05:06.645
You're out of it. The Phoenix
Foundation is out of it too.

05:06.646 --> 05:08.980
Listen, I feel badly about Tony,

05:08.981 --> 05:12.984
but he knew the risks he was taking
when he was dealing with the mob.

05:12.985 --> 05:14.319
Sort of made his own bed.

05:14.320 --> 05:18.156
Yeah, now he gets to sleep in it.
Forever.

05:18.157 --> 05:21.937
I'II see you tomorrow.
Have a good trip.

05:38.427 --> 05:41.054
My good sir, have you no respect?

05:41.055 --> 05:42.847
Kindly remove that bottle
from my car.

05:42.848 --> 05:45.348
Keep your pants on.

05:47.853 --> 05:50.605
- What's your problem, pal?
- Do you know who I am?

05:50.606 --> 05:55.443
Guy Roberts, star of stage and screen.
Swashbuckler extraordinaire.

05:55.444 --> 05:57.904
Now, I have battled
with the best of them.

05:57.905 --> 06:01.200
FIynn, Fairbanks, Pickford!

06:06.538 --> 06:09.999
Touch me, and I'II make
mashed potatoes out of your face.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.417
Folks got a problem?

06:11.418 --> 06:15.463
This nasty Iummox refused
to remove his beer from my car.

06:15.464 --> 06:18.257
I tried to ask nicely,
but see what I got for it.

06:18.258 --> 06:23.596
You, sir, are a disgusting behemoth
with foul-smelling breath.

06:23.597 --> 06:26.557
Boys! Boys! There's gotta be
a better way to handle this.

06:26.558 --> 06:29.018
- You want in on this, too, pal?
- If I had my druthers--

06:29.019 --> 06:31.312
- You don't!
- Most of us are adults here.

06:31.313 --> 06:33.731
Can't we talk about-- ? No!

06:33.732 --> 06:35.525
Don't hit.

06:35.526 --> 06:37.902
Just calm down. Take it easy.

06:37.903 --> 06:41.113
AII right, Iook,
if this is the way it's gotta be,

06:41.114 --> 06:44.408
at Ieast Iet me get rid
of my jacket, huh?

06:44.409 --> 06:46.077
It's my favourite.

06:46.078 --> 06:48.120
I don't wanna see it ruined.

06:48.121 --> 06:51.031
It's your favourite jacket, huh?

06:56.254 --> 06:58.422
I'm sorry about that.

06:58.423 --> 07:01.550
That darned jacket's always
tripping people up Iike that.

07:01.551 --> 07:04.178
I've been meaning to have
a talk with it. Here you go.

07:04.179 --> 07:07.097
What do you say we get you checked
in and cleaned up, all right?

07:07.098 --> 07:11.143
Yeah, there you go. I'II talk to you Iater.
What do you say?

07:11.144 --> 07:13.145
Shoo.

07:13.146 --> 07:15.773
Thank you, young man.
I couldn't have done it without you.

07:15.774 --> 07:17.358
- Yes, thank you.
- No problem.

07:17.359 --> 07:19.526
- You have a name?
- MacGyver.

07:19.527 --> 07:22.071
- You know, of course, that I'm--
- Guy Roberts,

07:22.072 --> 07:26.872
star of stage and screen.
Swashbuckler extraordinaire.

07:26.993 --> 07:29.119
He knows who I am.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.205
You've perhaps seen
some of my pictures?

07:31.206 --> 07:32.956
Well, not exactly.

07:32.957 --> 07:35.793
You'II be happy to hear that
we're about to make another one.

07:35.794 --> 07:38.045
- We're just on our way to Hollywood.
- Darling,

07:38.046 --> 07:40.631
don't you think we'd better be
heading in? It's been a Iong day.

07:40.632 --> 07:43.509
Yes, darling, of course.
I am rather tired.

07:43.510 --> 07:45.552
Dueling does take it out of you,
you know.

07:45.553 --> 07:48.639
- Well, parting is such sweet sorrow.
- Guy.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.098
Yes, dear.

07:50.099 --> 07:54.269
- Goodbye, Mr. MacGyver.
- Well, see you, folks.

07:54.270 --> 07:55.812
We didn't wanna shoot him,
we had to.

07:55.813 --> 07:58.315
Shut up. Just Iet me think.

07:58.316 --> 08:00.484
I knew the two of you
weren't particularly bright,

08:00.485 --> 08:02.444
but I didn't know
just how stupid you were.

08:02.445 --> 08:04.529
- We did the best we could.
- It wasn't good enough.

08:04.530 --> 08:06.823
- He pulled a gun on us.
- He shouldn't have gotten away

08:06.824 --> 08:08.992
- in the first place.
- Come on, who was to know Tony

08:08.993 --> 08:11.661
- was gonna turn informant?
- Phil, you brought him to me.

08:11.662 --> 08:14.748
- You vouched for him.
- I made a mistake. It happens.

08:14.749 --> 08:16.458
Not with me it doesn't.

08:16.459 --> 08:18.752
Did you at Ieast have the intelligence
to stash the car?

08:18.753 --> 08:21.171
Yeah. We found a garage
just outside of town.

08:21.172 --> 08:23.298
Hooray.
Hooray, you did something right.

08:23.299 --> 08:25.967
Now, do something else right.
Find the satchel.

08:25.968 --> 08:27.969
It could be anywhere.

08:27.970 --> 08:30.470
Let me explain something.

08:30.681 --> 08:33.183
I'm kind of Iike a travelling salesman.

08:33.183 --> 08:37.520
But now because of you two slimeballs,
I have no merchandise to sell.

08:37.520 --> 08:41.066
This isn't gonna make my supplier
a very happy man. And I promise you,

08:41.067 --> 08:43.318
he won't be satisfied
with just my head.

08:43.318 --> 08:45.946
He's also gonna want yours.

08:47.323 --> 08:49.823
Find my money.

08:53.954 --> 08:56.454
I'II just put the top up.

08:56.624 --> 08:59.042
Will you bring in my makeup case?

08:59.043 --> 09:01.543
Certainly, dear.

09:02.922 --> 09:05.882
- She is a beauty, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.

09:05.883 --> 09:11.993
Well, you come in when you're ready,
I'II Ieave the door unlocked.

09:46.381 --> 09:48.926
Darling, my makeup case.

09:49.176 --> 09:51.676
Just a minute, dear.

10:08.612 --> 10:13.866
Sorry, Mr. Roberts.
You're over your Iimit on this card too.

10:13.867 --> 10:16.367
Very well.

10:17.454 --> 10:19.954
Afraid not.

10:20.832 --> 10:23.125
My good man, I am Guy Roberts.

10:23.126 --> 10:25.502
Time was when that name alone
was sufficient

10:25.503 --> 10:27.838
to guarantee a night's Iodging
and a hot meal.

10:27.839 --> 10:30.132
Sorry, friend,
I've got other people waiting.

10:30.133 --> 10:33.123
Look, there must be some mistake.

10:33.178 --> 10:34.803
Our credit's always been good.

10:34.804 --> 10:38.140
I'm sure you're right, ma'am,
but it's company policy.

10:38.141 --> 10:42.645
- You do accept cash, do you not?
- Of course.

10:42.979 --> 10:46.023
I think you'II find that this
is more than sufficient.

10:46.024 --> 10:49.818
And here's a Iittle extra
for your hospitality.

10:49.819 --> 10:52.279
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.324
If there is any kindness
I can show to any creature,

10:55.325 --> 11:00.345
Iet me do it now for I shall not pass
this way again.

11:09.714 --> 11:13.684
Rental cars.
A lot like playing hot potato.

11:13.843 --> 11:17.554
And I got burned by an
overheated air conditioner.

11:17.555 --> 11:20.348
Fortunately, even if you are
in the middle of nowhere,

11:20.349 --> 11:22.851
a fuse is an easy thing to duplicate.

11:22.852 --> 11:28.565
All you need is something that'll
carry a current, like a paper clip.

11:28.566 --> 11:31.066
Here's your change, sir.

11:33.362 --> 11:34.988
Where did you get
these new twenties?

11:34.989 --> 11:39.868
Hey, I can't remember everybody
who pays with twenty-dollar--

11:39.869 --> 11:43.538
- Now can you remember?
- The old man, the actor.

11:43.539 --> 11:46.249
- Actor got a name?
- Guy-- Guy Roberts.

11:46.250 --> 11:49.836
- What kind of car is he driving?
- An old Caddy convertible.

11:49.837 --> 11:52.337
He's headed for Hollywood.

11:53.591 --> 11:56.634
If you mention this discussion
to anyone,

11:56.635 --> 11:59.195
I'II be back for my change.

12:06.937 --> 12:09.899
California, here I come

12:10.065 --> 12:16.155
- Right back where I started from
- Right back where I started from

12:17.489 --> 12:20.241
A paper clip can be
a wondrous thing.

12:20.242 --> 12:21.868
More times than I can remember,

12:21.869 --> 12:24.203
one of these has gotten me
out of a tight spot.

12:24.204 --> 12:29.044
I was sure this would be
another one of those times.

12:31.295 --> 12:34.655
So much
for the wondrous paper clip.

12:35.591 --> 12:37.675
Why didn't you tell me
about the money?

12:37.676 --> 12:40.386
I was saving it as a surprise.

12:40.387 --> 12:42.680
Actually, it's supposed
to be our nest egg.

12:42.681 --> 12:45.099
And Iook how I've broken it
wide open.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.934
I didn't know we had
that kind of money.

12:46.935 --> 12:51.022
We don't. We didn't,
until my agent came through.

12:51.023 --> 12:53.274
The studio is so excited
about this project

12:53.275 --> 12:56.527
that they've paid me
a bonus up front.

12:56.528 --> 12:58.946
It's just advance money.

12:58.947 --> 13:01.616
Oh, Guy, I have to tell you,

13:01.783 --> 13:04.410
when you first told me
about this job in Hollywood,

13:04.411 --> 13:09.171
I was sure it was just
another one of your stories.

13:09.458 --> 13:13.002
Just an excuse to take me
on this trip.

13:13.003 --> 13:14.753
Would that have been so wrong?

13:14.754 --> 13:19.834
How could I ever have doubted you?
Will you forgive me?

13:20.302 --> 13:22.802
What's to forgive?

13:25.181 --> 13:28.642
Isn't that that nice young man
we met at the motel, dear?

13:28.643 --> 13:33.083
Yes. It Iooks as if
he's in need of assistance.

13:45.535 --> 13:47.619
- Howdy, folks.
- Having a spot of trouble?

13:47.620 --> 13:50.831
Yeah, the electrical system
seems to be shot.

13:50.832 --> 13:52.791
Hop in.
We've got plenty of room.

13:52.792 --> 13:56.211
- I'd sure appreciate that.
- Not at all. Think nothing of it.

13:56.212 --> 13:57.963
One good turn deserves another.

13:57.964 --> 14:00.634
I owe you one from yesterday.

14:02.802 --> 14:09.802
Try not to bring any of that sand into
the car with you, if you don't mind.

14:12.186 --> 14:14.686
Thank you.

14:20.194 --> 14:21.778
Your name is...

14:21.779 --> 14:23.280
What was your name again,
young man?

14:23.281 --> 14:25.699
- MacGyver.
- Where you headed?

14:25.700 --> 14:27.409
AIbuquerque Airport.

14:27.410 --> 14:30.662
We're passing right through.
On our way to Hollywood.

14:30.663 --> 14:34.833
- Guy's going to be in a new picture.
- That's terrific. What's it called?

14:34.834 --> 14:39.380
Space Pirates.
It's supposed to be really groovy.

14:39.797 --> 14:43.133
- Space Pirates?
- That's just a working title, dear.

14:43.134 --> 14:44.593
They'II probably change it.

14:44.594 --> 14:46.720
Hollywood producers
are always changing things

14:46.721 --> 14:49.311
right up to the Iast minute.

14:51.726 --> 14:53.226
How do you know
they took this road?

14:53.227 --> 14:54.811
Because this is the road
to Hollywood.

14:54.812 --> 14:56.813
And that's where the clerk
said they were headed.

14:56.814 --> 14:58.565
Yeah, but they got
a head start on us.

14:58.566 --> 15:03.586
OId man, old car,
I bet he's taking it nice and easy.

15:06.115 --> 15:09.576
Beautiful country, isn't it?
God's country.

15:09.577 --> 15:12.453
I made a picture,
Geronimo's Last Ride.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.414
Oh, yeah, I think I saw you in that.

15:14.415 --> 15:15.999
Didn't you play Geronimo?

15:16.000 --> 15:19.460
No, that was Thurston Powell.
I was with the cavalry.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.879
But it must have been filmed
somewhere around here.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.590
It was Arizona, dear.

15:23.591 --> 15:28.219
Well, all the world's a stage, and all
its men and women merely players.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.221
Yes, Arizona.

15:30.222 --> 15:31.639
What about you?

15:31.640 --> 15:35.518
What brings you out
to the middle of nowhere?

15:35.519 --> 15:37.145
Sightseeing.

15:37.146 --> 15:41.358
Hey, Iooks Iike we found
our '59 Caddy.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.568
I wish we could go sightseeing.

15:43.569 --> 15:47.488
But shooting schedules
being what they are--

15:47.489 --> 15:51.951
Do you believe that?
Open road, no other cars in sight,

15:51.952 --> 15:57.206
and this ruddy idiot would rather
sound off than go around me.

15:57.207 --> 16:00.147
- Pull over!
- Someone you know?

16:00.294 --> 16:01.585
Not really.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.086
Force them over.

16:06.633 --> 16:11.053
Nobody, but nobody,
touches my car and gets away with it.

16:11.054 --> 16:14.544
And I know this baby
can outrun them.

16:14.808 --> 16:18.488
- They're speeding up.
- Stay with them.

16:19.104 --> 16:21.105
Pull up alongside.

16:21.106 --> 16:23.606
Hit him again.

16:26.403 --> 16:29.405
Maybe this will scare him a Iittle.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.657
- Pull over!
- He's got a gun.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.908
Try to pull out in front. FIoor it!

16:34.995 --> 16:37.605
I'm going as fast as I can.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.337
Guy, pull over. He's crazy as a Ioon.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.298
No! Whatever you do, don't stop!

16:48.341 --> 16:51.171
They're getting so much closer.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.683
Mr. MacGyver, your Iuggage.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.935
We've got to put
a Iittle distance between us. May I?

16:59.936 --> 17:04.096
- Well, yes, of course. Anything.
- Thank you.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.738
Good shot!

17:12.865 --> 17:16.885
They're getting away!
Get back on the road!

17:17.954 --> 17:22.104
Come on, come on, come on!
Move it! Move it!

17:25.712 --> 17:28.212
Here they come again.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.550
That's it, that's it.
Keep it coming.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.552
What could those men
possibly want?

17:33.553 --> 17:36.012
- I don't think I wanna know.
- Do something.

17:36.013 --> 17:39.891
I'm running out of ammo.
This satchel's all we got Ieft.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.512
No! No, not that one.
I need that one.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.772
This reminds me of
The Great Pursuit.

17:45.773 --> 17:50.033
But your stuntman
did all the driving in that.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.031
This isn't a movie.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.532
They're using real bullets.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.926
Faster, Guy!

18:27.523 --> 18:30.023
Watch where you're going!

18:30.859 --> 18:32.944
- Why are we slowing?
- Something's on the wheel.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.745
- What is it?
- I don't know.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.618
Stop the car and have a Iook.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.120
It's that canvas thing he threw at us.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.454
Get it off.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.955
I'm trying.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.543
No, no, just back up.

18:48.544 --> 18:52.004
Back up the car. Hit the brake!
Now go forward.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.674
- Did it.
- That's right. Let's go.

18:54.675 --> 18:57.535
- What now?
- Just keep moving.

18:58.470 --> 19:02.265
- What are you doing?
- Gonna put the top up.

19:02.266 --> 19:05.559
If you put the top up while driving,
it will rip right off.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.812
I sure hope so.

19:07.813 --> 19:11.113
But I got a few things to do first.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.655
Would you please tell me
what you're doing.

19:17.656 --> 19:21.226
I'II explain Iater,
just bear with me.

19:26.248 --> 19:30.252
- Not the top!
- Sorry, I'II fix it Iater.

19:34.130 --> 19:36.590
SIow it down.
Let them get right behind us.

19:36.591 --> 19:39.593
- You Iost your head, old boy?
- I'm hoping this top

19:39.594 --> 19:42.294
will keep that from happening.

19:44.140 --> 19:46.934
AII right, slow down, Guy.
SIow it down.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.435
Let them catch up.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.565
Get ready to flip the switch.

19:53.566 --> 19:56.235
Put the top up
when I give you the word.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.736
Now!

19:59.197 --> 20:01.240
- Look out!
- I can't see anything!

20:01.241 --> 20:03.117
It worked! They're stopping.

20:03.118 --> 20:07.088
Keep it floored, Guy.
We need the distance.

20:09.749 --> 20:12.877
Get it off. Get it off!

20:13.836 --> 20:20.216
Unbelievable. What are you waiting
for? Get the jack and fix the tire!

20:22.261 --> 20:25.071
- Good show!
- Bravo, MacGyver.

20:25.515 --> 20:28.183
This reminds me of
one of my favourite roles.

20:28.184 --> 20:31.061
I played the swashbuckler
on Holiday in Ruritania.

20:31.062 --> 20:33.397
It wasn't Ruritania, dear.
It was Colorado.

20:33.398 --> 20:36.983
I remember. It was you and Stewart
Granger in The Prisoner of Zenda.

20:36.984 --> 20:39.236
No, that was James Mason.

20:39.237 --> 20:41.738
I starred in Mulligan's Revenge.

20:41.739 --> 20:45.159
Oh, yeah, Mulligan's Revenge.

20:47.912 --> 20:51.081
Would you get off my back?
I'm working as fast as I can.

20:51.082 --> 20:55.422
My mother could change a tire
faster than this.

20:59.090 --> 21:00.298
Looks Iike trouble.

21:00.299 --> 21:03.051
- What is it, Guy?
- I'm not sure.

21:03.052 --> 21:04.886
- Sounds Iike we're out of gas.
- Impossible.

21:04.887 --> 21:07.806
- I just filled her up this morning.
- Well, I hope it's nothing serious.

21:07.807 --> 21:14.077
There's no telling how Iong before
those goons get back on the road.

21:20.528 --> 21:23.863
Keep an eye on them.
Let me know if they make a move.

21:23.864 --> 21:26.584
I'II see what the problem is.

21:30.287 --> 21:33.164
Well, isn't that nice?
They stopped to wait for us.

21:33.165 --> 21:34.874
- I'II get them.
- Hey, good idea, Phil.

21:34.875 --> 21:37.377
By the time you're halfway there,
we'II have this tire fixed.

21:37.378 --> 21:40.868
Get your butt back here
and help Tom!

21:42.508 --> 21:44.008
I found it.

21:44.009 --> 21:47.178
- The fuel Iine's cracked.
- What next?

21:47.179 --> 21:50.014
She just wasn't meant
to take this sort of abuse.

21:50.015 --> 21:51.265
Well, Iook at her.

21:51.266 --> 21:53.476
Her body's battered,
her spirit's broken.

21:53.477 --> 21:56.771
Yes, but, Guy,
she's held up Iike a champion.

21:56.772 --> 22:01.052
I just don't know how much more
she can take.

22:01.693 --> 22:04.987
I feel the same way
about my Jeep, Mr. Roberts.

22:04.988 --> 22:09.283
It's a good thing metal can be fixed
a Iot easier than flesh, huh?

22:09.284 --> 22:12.995
Listen, would you have a
ballpoint pen I could borrow?

22:12.996 --> 22:14.830
Sure.

22:14.831 --> 22:16.916
Who would you Iike me
to make it out to?

22:16.917 --> 22:19.417
Well, actually...

22:19.670 --> 22:22.672
MacGyver. Just MacGyver.

22:22.839 --> 22:24.340
Don't be embarrassed.

22:24.341 --> 22:28.094
I get this all the time, you know.
There you are.

22:28.095 --> 22:30.595
Thank you, sir.

22:30.889 --> 22:33.389
Thanks, MacGyver.

22:34.851 --> 22:36.560
Guy?

22:36.561 --> 22:41.232
Could I borrow that pen again? I might
be able to fix the fuel Iine with it.

22:41.233 --> 22:42.691
Sure.

22:42.692 --> 22:45.528
Thank you. And thank you.

22:48.865 --> 22:50.866
If you don't mind my asking,

22:50.867 --> 22:54.286
how is that pen going to solve
our gasoline problem?

22:54.287 --> 22:58.707
I'm gonna use it to bridge
the fuel Iine and seal the Ieak.

22:58.708 --> 23:00.709
What's happening
with our friends down below?

23:00.710 --> 23:03.430
Well, it's very hard to tell.

23:04.881 --> 23:08.131
They don't appear to be moving yet.

23:15.141 --> 23:19.811
MacGyver, about those fellows
who were shooting at us just now...

23:19.812 --> 23:22.898
Yeah, I guess I owe you both
an explanation.

23:22.899 --> 23:24.900
You do?

23:24.901 --> 23:28.445
Yeah. See, I work for a company
called the Phoenix Foundation.

23:28.446 --> 23:30.906
And I was sent here
to pick something up.

23:30.907 --> 23:33.950
I don't think those fellows
down there want me to have it.

23:33.951 --> 23:36.203
What were you supposed
to pick up?

23:36.204 --> 23:39.706
I'm not sure.
I never had a chance to find out.

23:39.707 --> 23:42.209
I sure am sorry to get
you folks involved Iike this.

23:42.210 --> 23:44.753
That's all right, boy.
We're all in this together.

23:44.754 --> 23:47.924
I said that in Dance of the Sword.

23:48.299 --> 23:50.717
Or was it Duel to the Death?

23:50.718 --> 23:53.762
You said that in both
those movies, dear.

23:53.763 --> 23:56.263
That's right.

24:02.772 --> 24:05.065
What on earth is he doing now?

24:05.066 --> 24:07.566
No idea.

24:18.245 --> 24:21.372
- What are you doing?
- I gotta borrow this.

24:21.373 --> 24:24.363
- My muffler?
- I'II replace it.

24:25.795 --> 24:28.505
Now all we gotta do
is cool this baby off.

24:28.506 --> 24:30.924
You wouldn't have any water
Ieft in that cooler, would you?

24:30.925 --> 24:33.425
I'II Iook.

24:38.474 --> 24:40.141
Lord, man, what are you up to now?

24:40.142 --> 24:42.842
Just a Iittle protection, sir.

24:47.566 --> 24:50.318
You suppose there will be anything
Ieft of the car when he's done?

24:50.319 --> 24:52.987
I'm sure Mr. MacGyver
knows what he's doing, dear.

24:52.988 --> 24:55.488
Water, please.

25:01.121 --> 25:03.621
AII right.

25:09.296 --> 25:11.796
My...

25:13.926 --> 25:16.426
I'II buy you another one.

25:32.778 --> 25:34.862
Come on, hurry up.
They're gonna get the Caddy fixed

25:34.863 --> 25:37.363
before we get out of here.

25:40.994 --> 25:43.370
Hold that, would you please?

25:43.371 --> 25:45.871
Gasoline?

25:49.544 --> 25:51.211
AII right, Iet's move it!

25:51.212 --> 25:55.007
They're not gonna sit up there
and wait for us all day.

25:55.008 --> 25:57.508
They're coming.

25:59.054 --> 26:04.214
Looks Iike their pit crew
was a Iittle faster than ours.

26:05.685 --> 26:08.185
Time to go, kids.

26:14.277 --> 26:16.777
Go, Guy!

26:27.874 --> 26:30.042
How's it going back there, Iad?

26:30.043 --> 26:32.553
Keep your eyes on the road.

26:40.178 --> 26:43.097
No, not my seats.

26:43.264 --> 26:47.914
Don't worry, I know a guy
who's great with seats.

26:59.155 --> 27:01.740
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think I'm going?

27:01.741 --> 27:06.371
Stop. Stop! They went
the other way. Now, back up.

27:09.832 --> 27:13.162
Come on, come on, come on.
Move it!

27:24.889 --> 27:28.141
Mrs. Roberts, could you pass me
that gasoline, please?

27:28.142 --> 27:31.312
- I beg your pardon?
- Gasoline.

27:31.979 --> 27:34.647
Tearing the stuffing
out of the Caddy was easy.

27:34.648 --> 27:38.026
Using it to stop the guys chasing us
was another matter.

27:38.027 --> 27:39.527
Gasoline would help.

27:39.528 --> 27:42.488
Always does
when you need an explosion.

27:42.489 --> 27:44.324
Since I bent the back
of the tailpipe,

27:44.325 --> 27:47.910
the explosion only
had one way to go: out.

27:47.911 --> 27:51.372
And it was gonna take Guy's
steering wheel knob right along with it.

27:51.373 --> 27:53.666
Sort of a homemade mortar.

27:53.667 --> 27:57.447
Step on it.
We gotta get closer to them.

28:01.216 --> 28:03.342
Are you creating another
obstacle for them?

28:03.343 --> 28:05.843
Yeah, that's the idea.

28:16.523 --> 28:19.023
Duck!

28:21.361 --> 28:24.191
Next time, keep the car steady.

28:26.366 --> 28:29.066
Push in the cigarette Iighter.

28:38.670 --> 28:41.631
Now all I need is this fuse.

28:41.798 --> 28:44.298
The cigarette Iighter ready?

28:46.136 --> 28:47.386
Now what?

28:47.387 --> 28:51.247
Touch it to the fuse
and pray this works.

28:54.227 --> 28:58.777
- What's he doing?
- He's aiming something at us.

29:00.692 --> 29:03.192
It worked!

29:06.906 --> 29:08.782
SIow it down! No, no!

29:08.783 --> 29:13.573
Phil, what are you doing?
Phil, Iook-- SIow it-- No!

29:15.832 --> 29:17.249
We got them!

29:17.250 --> 29:19.543
To the victor belongs the spoils.

29:19.544 --> 29:22.044
Hallelujah!

29:27.260 --> 29:32.610
- Is everybody all right?
- Yeah, yeah, just check the car.

29:34.225 --> 29:36.725
Hey, what was that thing?

29:36.728 --> 29:39.146
- I don't know. Some sort of cannon.
- Where did he get it?

29:39.147 --> 29:40.772
What difference does it make?

29:40.773 --> 29:42.774
Radiator's shot.
We're out a set of wheels.

29:42.775 --> 29:45.027
- Now what do we do?
- We do what we started out to do.

29:45.028 --> 29:46.570
Nothing's changed.
I want that money.

29:46.571 --> 29:48.071
- We're gonna walk?
- Exactly.

29:48.072 --> 29:50.657
They have to stop sometime,
and when they do, I wanna be there.

29:50.658 --> 29:53.158
Let's go.

29:59.834 --> 30:02.712
Oh, my, Iisten to the engine.

30:04.005 --> 30:07.299
I'm afraid it's serious.
Now the oil Iight is on.

30:07.300 --> 30:11.070
I'm not sure, but I'd say she's had it.

30:21.605 --> 30:25.785
MacGyver, I think
this is what they're after.

30:42.376 --> 30:44.335
Is this all yours?

30:44.336 --> 30:46.337
Well...

30:46.338 --> 30:47.964
Why, yes...

30:47.965 --> 30:51.245
...insofar as it's in my possession.

30:51.510 --> 30:55.240
- You see--
- There is no job, is there?

31:01.103 --> 31:03.354
It is not my money.
I found it in the car.

31:03.355 --> 31:05.022
- What?
- Project, Guy.

31:05.023 --> 31:07.942
Those of us in the back row
would Iike to hear as well.

31:07.943 --> 31:11.696
It is not my money.
I found it in the car.

31:11.697 --> 31:14.866
- And how did it get in the car?
- I don't know.

31:14.867 --> 31:16.242
- You don't know?
- No.

31:16.243 --> 31:18.286
But you thought
you'd keep it anyway.

31:18.287 --> 31:20.288
- Excuse me, folks, but I don't think--
- No?

31:20.289 --> 31:22.373
Then why is it even in the car?

31:22.374 --> 31:25.710
Why did you use it to pay
the motel bill, Guy? Why?

31:25.711 --> 31:29.130
Because I'm tired of being treated
Iike an old fool.

31:29.131 --> 31:31.215
I'm tired of being a failure.

31:31.216 --> 31:36.076
I'm tired of the way
you had to Iive because of it.

31:36.221 --> 31:40.191
- I just wanted to make you happy.
- Happy?

31:40.392 --> 31:42.518
Happy that my husband is a thief?

31:42.519 --> 31:44.770
Happy that you Iied to me?

31:44.771 --> 31:46.897
Happy to have a carload
of hooligans

31:46.898 --> 31:48.858
shoot at us and nearly
run us off the road?

31:48.859 --> 31:52.070
Do I Iook happy to you?

31:52.571 --> 31:55.198
Age cannot wither her,

31:55.365 --> 31:58.534
nor custom stale her infinite variety.

31:58.535 --> 32:02.295
Antony and Cleopatra.
Act two, scene two.

32:03.748 --> 32:05.666
Mrs. Roberts?

32:05.667 --> 32:09.795
If it helps any, this is probably
more my fault than Guy's.

32:09.796 --> 32:14.633
Unless I miss my guess,
this money was meant for me.

32:14.634 --> 32:16.051
- June--
- You be quiet.

32:16.052 --> 32:18.512
You've gotten us into
enough trouble already.

32:18.513 --> 32:22.599
Look, if we Ieave the money here,
will they Ieave us alone?

32:22.600 --> 32:26.812
They don't strike me as the type
to Iet bygones be bygones, ma'am.

32:26.813 --> 32:28.730
I think we're gonna have
to keep on moving.

32:28.731 --> 32:31.691
Where do you suggest we move to?

32:31.901 --> 32:36.071
I'm afraid the old girl hasn't got it
in her to carry us any further.

32:36.072 --> 32:38.365
Guy, what does that Iook Iike
to you down there?

32:38.366 --> 32:40.701
A deserted town perhaps.

32:40.702 --> 32:44.121
Probably is. But at Ieast we won't
be out in the open any Ionger.

32:44.122 --> 32:46.622
Come on, hop in.

33:02.807 --> 33:05.347
- Got it in neutral?
- Yes.

33:14.485 --> 33:16.027
I'm hot, I'm tired and I'm thirsty.

33:16.028 --> 33:17.988
- How Iong we gonna keep this up?
- Can it!

33:17.989 --> 33:21.241
- I'm sick of hearing you complain.
- I'm sick of you wasting our time.

33:21.242 --> 33:23.994
When are you gonna get it? They got
away. They're not gonna stop.

33:23.995 --> 33:25.745
We're not gonna get
that money back--

33:25.746 --> 33:28.665
You're wrong.
We're not giving up.

33:28.666 --> 33:31.000
- Now, you start moving.
- How Iong?

33:31.001 --> 33:33.336
How Iong are we just gonna
keep walking Iike this?

33:33.337 --> 33:35.463
You can walk now
or run for the rest of your Iife.

33:35.464 --> 33:37.465
That's what you'II have to do
to stay alive

33:37.466 --> 33:40.476
if we don't get that money back.

33:50.604 --> 33:53.104
- What?
- Oil.

33:53.274 --> 33:55.400
- Fresh oil.
- Big deal.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.527
It is a big deal.

33:57.528 --> 34:01.322
If their car's Ieaking this much oil,
it's not gonna take them much farther.

34:01.323 --> 34:03.823
We got them.

34:09.540 --> 34:12.333
If I can get us on
a good roll down this hill,

34:12.333 --> 34:15.043
we can coast all the way
to that town.

34:15.045 --> 34:16.963
This is humiliating.

34:16.964 --> 34:20.424
I've never driven this car
so slowly before in my Iife.

34:20.425 --> 34:23.886
MacGyver, do you think those nasty
men will follow us here?

34:23.887 --> 34:26.889
Well, this seems
to be the only town around.

34:26.889 --> 34:29.891
We'II just have to be ready
for them in case they do.

34:29.893 --> 34:33.563
I do hope we've
seen the Iast of them.

34:33.647 --> 34:37.007
- My feet are killing me.
- Shut up.

34:37.150 --> 34:40.987
Well, this is where the hill runs out.
Welcome to Main Street.

34:40.987 --> 34:42.987
What a place to be stranded,

34:42.989 --> 34:45.449
a deserted town miles
from civilization,

34:45.449 --> 34:47.743
hotter than Hades.

34:47.744 --> 34:50.371
Oh, what I'd give
for a nice, tall drink of ice water.

34:50.371 --> 34:54.041
It'II be cooler in the shade. Why don't
you stop the car under this tree?

34:54.042 --> 34:56.542
What a good idea.

34:56.920 --> 35:01.048
I'm not so sure we want to Ieave
the car out in the open, Guy.

35:01.049 --> 35:03.929
Let's put her behind that shed.

35:04.928 --> 35:06.720
It should be Iess obvious there.

35:06.721 --> 35:12.011
Just in case our friends manage
to find a ride into town.

35:22.654 --> 35:25.374
I think we got them. Come on.

35:47.136 --> 35:48.637
Well, now what?

35:48.638 --> 35:52.934
Well, this much money
never seemed real to me.

35:53.101 --> 35:55.601
Well, it's real now, Guy.

35:56.145 --> 35:59.395
Maybe not.
Can I see one of those?

36:00.566 --> 36:05.404
Why was it so important for Tony
to give me this money?

36:05.405 --> 36:07.905
Paper's good.

36:08.324 --> 36:09.658
Ink's all right.

36:09.659 --> 36:12.489
- Can I see some more?
- Sure.

36:24.298 --> 36:26.049
I think we're dealing
with counterfeiters.

36:26.050 --> 36:28.176
AII the serial numbers
on these bills are the same.

36:28.177 --> 36:30.679
No wonder they're so anxious
to get their hands on the money.

36:30.680 --> 36:33.682
They're not going to give up
until they have it, are they?

36:33.683 --> 36:36.559
We're not about
to give up either, ma'am.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.019
I got a plan.

36:38.020 --> 36:40.522
Guy, I want you to pull
the horn out of your car.

36:40.523 --> 36:43.663
I think I can put it to good use.

36:46.487 --> 36:48.655
The town should be
just around this bend,

36:48.656 --> 36:51.157
and then we'II have them
and the money.

36:51.158 --> 36:53.034
What makes you think
they're gonna be there?

36:53.035 --> 36:57.747
Dead car, senior citizens,
where else would they go?

36:57.748 --> 37:01.709
I knew it was only a matter of time
before those guys paid us a visit.

37:01.710 --> 37:05.922
And I didn't exactly wanna
throw out a welcome mat.

37:05.923 --> 37:07.382
So as soon as I got the car horn,

37:07.383 --> 37:10.510
I'd be able to put the finishing
touches on a doorbell

37:10.511 --> 37:13.051
with a rather piercing ring.

37:13.055 --> 37:17.308
To do that, I needed some wire
and two metal contact points:

37:17.309 --> 37:20.859
The front doorhandle
and the horseshoe.

37:21.647 --> 37:28.107
Connect them both to this battery,
and I should have a proper greeting.

37:28.862 --> 37:31.362
We got them now.

37:33.909 --> 37:39.289
- June, I...
- Guy, I'm so disappointed in you.

37:44.586 --> 37:48.089
- Here's the horn you asked for.
- Thank you, sir.

37:48.090 --> 37:50.717
MacGyver, what have I done?

37:50.884 --> 37:53.719
Was it worth it,
tearing her up Iike this?

37:53.720 --> 37:57.389
I think it'd be best
if you didn't think about it, sir.

37:57.390 --> 37:59.100
But I can guarantee you,

37:59.101 --> 38:03.437
when this is all over, she'II be back
just the way you remember her.

38:03.438 --> 38:06.482
You're a good chap, but I'm afraid
it's not quite as simple as that.

38:06.483 --> 38:08.484
I've never seen her Iike this before.

38:08.485 --> 38:12.613
Well, you've probably never quite put
her through anything Iike this before.

38:12.614 --> 38:16.826
Perhaps not,
but that's hollow consolation.

38:16.993 --> 38:19.787
Yeah, I know. She may not
Iook Iike much now--

38:19.788 --> 38:21.455
Not Iook Iike much?

38:21.456 --> 38:25.918
I'II have you know that she Iooks as
good now as the day I married her.

38:25.919 --> 38:28.419
Married?

38:29.214 --> 38:30.964
You're talking about June.

38:30.965 --> 38:33.465
Well, yes, of course. June.

38:33.802 --> 38:36.922
Who else would I be talking about?

38:38.139 --> 38:42.789
I'd give anything to get her
to talk to me again.

38:48.399 --> 38:50.192
What are you up to now?

38:50.193 --> 38:54.196
Well, a good relationship
is a Iot Iike a car.

38:54.197 --> 38:58.825
If you want it to work smoothly,
you gotta put a Iot of work into it...

38:58.826 --> 39:01.366
...and have the right tools.

39:06.876 --> 39:11.796
FIowers make a pretty good tool
for that kind of job.

39:14.967 --> 39:17.969
Now it's up to you to do the work.

39:17.970 --> 39:20.470
MacGyver, thank you.

40:53.607 --> 40:56.107
June.

40:57.611 --> 41:01.521
I'd Iike to say I'm sorry
for everything.

41:01.615 --> 41:06.660
For taking you away from Hollywood,
from your friends, from your career.

41:06.661 --> 41:10.873
For having to put up with
my insufferable pride

41:10.874 --> 41:13.292
and intolerable ego.

41:13.293 --> 41:14.960
Guy Roberts.

41:14.961 --> 41:18.964
You honestly believe you could make
me do anything I didn't want to do?

41:18.965 --> 41:22.635
I've spent my Iife with you
because I've wanted to.

41:22.636 --> 41:25.136
Because I Iove you.

41:28.558 --> 41:30.976
Oh, Guy.

41:30.977 --> 41:35.147
Doubt that the stars are fire,
doubt that the sun doth move,

41:35.148 --> 41:40.570
doubt truth to be a Iiar,
but never doubt my Iove.

41:47.744 --> 41:49.328
They're beautiful.

41:49.329 --> 41:52.079
I think they're beautiful too.

41:52.457 --> 41:57.347
Why don't you folks just get up
and join me outside.

42:29.869 --> 42:33.069
Sounds Iike my boys found your car.

42:55.102 --> 42:57.896
AII right, old man,
where's the money?

42:57.897 --> 43:00.941
- In the front.
- Go get it.

43:03.903 --> 43:06.779
When you've got the money,
you will Ieave us alone, won't you?

43:06.780 --> 43:09.280
Sure, Iady, just as soon--

43:11.327 --> 43:13.827
En garde.

43:21.754 --> 43:24.254
Guy, watch out!

43:34.933 --> 43:37.561
My hero.

43:39.271 --> 43:41.063
Hey, I got it.

43:41.064 --> 43:42.815
Guy Roberts from the Late Show.

43:42.816 --> 43:45.276
Rampage of the Round Table.
Night of a Thousand Days.

43:45.277 --> 43:47.528
- That Guy Roberts?
- Yes, that's it.

43:47.529 --> 43:50.823
That's it, precisely.
That Guy Roberts.

43:50.824 --> 43:53.654
You know, he actually knows me.

43:53.785 --> 43:56.872
Somebody actually remembers.

44:11.470 --> 44:15.097
Hollywood has changed so much.
This used to be the club Oasis.

44:15.098 --> 44:18.185
Everybody used to come here.

44:18.351 --> 44:20.811
Now it's just an old body shop.

44:20.812 --> 44:22.688
Come on now, kids,

44:22.689 --> 44:26.108
there's still a Iittle bit of
Hollywood magic Ieft here.

44:26.109 --> 44:28.609
Pete!

44:28.987 --> 44:31.487
Showtime.

44:35.160 --> 44:37.660
Voilà.

44:37.912 --> 44:40.412
Oh, Guy, she's beautiful.

44:40.457 --> 44:42.082
It's unbelievable.

44:42.083 --> 44:44.803
I told you it could be fixed.

44:46.671 --> 44:49.006
Well, it Iooks Iike your bonus
is appreciated.

44:49.007 --> 44:50.841
And well deserved too.

44:50.842 --> 44:52.509
You stopped the boys
with the funny money

44:52.510 --> 44:54.803
from saturating the entire
West Coast with it.

44:54.804 --> 44:57.598
- Got the plates too.
- Well, good.

44:57.599 --> 44:59.933
What?

44:59.934 --> 45:02.434
A scratch.

45:06.899 --> 45:09.399
