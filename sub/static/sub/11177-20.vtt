00:02.560 --> 00:05.360
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.440 --> 00:07.360
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.400
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:16.280
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

00:19.120 --> 00:21.920
<i>Michael was preparing for a meeting
with the Bluth Company board...</i>

00:22.040 --> 00:24.440
<i>to decide what to do with
some recently unfrozen funds.</i>

00:24.560 --> 00:26.720
Wow. Exciting, huh?

00:26.840 --> 00:29.640
- Finally getting some money.
- What do you want, Lindsay?

00:29.760 --> 00:32.479
- I'd like some of that money.
- Well, this money is for land.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.640
Okay? We're not gonna burn through it
like Dad did when he was in charge.

00:34.720 --> 00:37.600
With his bad investments,
and his corrupt dealings...

00:37.720 --> 00:39.520
- Mother's neck.
- No, that was a good investment.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.440
It is easier to look at now, isn't it?

00:41.560 --> 00:45.840
What if I told you that the money was
for something really worthwhile?

00:45.920 --> 00:47.840
- Like what?
- I want to have an affair.

00:47.960 --> 00:52.080
Now, I'm not sure with who yet,
but I'll need lingerie, waxings...

00:52.160 --> 00:54.000
These are some real costs, Michael.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.391
- I take it things aren't
getting better with Tobias.

00:56.392 --> 00:57.760
- What's that supposed to mean?

00:57.880 --> 01:01.240
<i>Things hadn't been getting better
with Michael's sister and her husband.</i>

01:01.360 --> 01:03.880
<i>Even after she came up with
a plan to get his attention.</i>

01:04.000 --> 01:05.800
Oh, my God. Listen to the radio.

01:05.920 --> 01:09.440
<i>I haven't heard this song
since we first started dating.</i>

01:09.560 --> 01:13.000
I just feel like using my body.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.952
Well, Lindsay, could
you use it over there?

01:15.953 --> 01:17.240
I'm trying to grow.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.920
Yeah. It's clear that's not gonna happen.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.160
We had sex once in the last year,
and he just laid there.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.080
All right. Look, this money is for land.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.000
I'm not gonna give you money
to have an affair.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.320
Why don't you pick something else
to boost up your self-worth?

01:29.440 --> 01:32.000
How about, uh, charity?
Why don't you get back to your roots?

01:32.080 --> 01:34.840
Well, it has been a while.
All right!

01:34.920 --> 01:37.400
I'm gonna go do that right now.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.760
You're gonna go get your hair done,
aren't you?

01:40.840 --> 01:43.560
Well, if I'm gonna have an affair...

01:45.600 --> 01:49.120
<i>Michael got a message
he intended to ignore.</i>

01:49.240 --> 01:51.040
<i>Until he read the next line.</i>

01:51.160 --> 01:54.720
<i>- A matter ofland, Mom?
- Oh, that's funny.</i>

01:54.840 --> 01:59.200
I meant "a matter of'L' and'D'... "
Life and death.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.080
What is the matter of life and death?

02:01.160 --> 02:03.840
Buster's jaw clicks when he eats.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.160
<i>I think it's what's
driving his friends away.</i>

02:06.240 --> 02:08.880
I sent him to Canada
for an operation.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.120
So I'll need some of that new money
that just came in.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.440
You know, Mom, if you want an operation
that's really gonna help him...

02:13.520 --> 02:15.760
you ought to have them
finally cut that cord.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.080
- He needs me.
- He doesn't need you.

02:18.200 --> 02:21.720
You coddle him. He's too old to go running
to his mommy with all his problems.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.840
I seem to remember a certain someone...

02:24.960 --> 02:28.640
running to Mommy when his
algebra teacher made an example of him.

02:28.760 --> 02:32.480
<i>Michael had been suspended
when another boy cheated offhis test.</i>

02:32.560 --> 02:34.960
Tracy won't marry me.
I won't get a job, and...

02:37.320 --> 02:39.920
What is this?
What's happening?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.880
Let Mama take care of it.

02:41.960 --> 02:46.080
I'll have a little chat
with Mr. Vandenbosch.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.440
<i>The next day, Mr. Vandenbosch
was not in school.</i>

02:49.560 --> 02:52.080
<i>He was never heard from again.</i>

02:52.160 --> 02:53.861
I know life is not fair to women.

02:53.862 --> 02:56.800
Your children grow up, and
they don't need you anymore.

02:56.920 --> 03:00.200
And I seem to remember
a certain grown man...

03:00.320 --> 03:02.120
who completely fell apart
two weeks ago...

03:02.240 --> 03:05.920
<i>when I taped over the Nova special
that had the girl on it he liked.</i>

03:06.040 --> 03:09.120
That was Buster. That's my point.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.680
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
was at the frozen banana stand...</i>

03:15.800 --> 03:17.600
<i>when he thought he spotted
a familiar face:</i>

03:17.720 --> 03:20.560
Pop-Pop?

03:20.640 --> 03:23.160
Sorry, miss.
Pop-Pop!

03:23.240 --> 03:25.600
- You think you saw Pop-Pop?
- But with hair! Which is probably why...

03:25.720 --> 03:27.880
- he asked for my hair, remember?
- Give Pop-Pop your hair!

03:28.000 --> 03:30.080
- Give me the hair!
- It all adds up.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.960
He stole somebody's hair,
made a wig, knocked out the guard...

03:34.080 --> 03:36.560
tunnelled his way through a sewer line,
and then stopped to get a candy apple...

03:36.640 --> 03:39.360
- on his way to Mexico!
- Of course!

03:39.480 --> 03:41.600
- You're mocking me.
- Of course.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.200
Listen, I know what I saw, Maeby.
And there's no other explanation.

03:45.280 --> 03:48.040
<i>So listen. My twin brother's in town.
I want you to take care ofhim.</i>

03:48.160 --> 03:50.440
- You still see Uncle Oscar?
- Tell you what.

03:50.560 --> 03:53.200
Give him ten grand
from the, uh, new cash.

03:53.280 --> 03:54.450
- Just send him on his way.

03:54.451 --> 03:56.400
- Dad, the money is
for the business, okay?

03:56.480 --> 03:58.400
- I'm not just gonna hand it all out.
- Michael!

03:58.520 --> 04:00.760
This is my brother. Do you know
what it's like to have a sibling...

04:00.840 --> 04:02.680
who has no source
of income except for you?

04:02.760 --> 04:06.000
just one? No. No idea.
It sounds wonderful though.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.280
Look, the board is watching
every move I make.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.085
Especially Jordan.

04:09.086 --> 04:12.200
He's just waiting for me to screw
up, so he can blow the whistle on me.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.040
Why don't you just
buy him out of his stock?

04:14.120 --> 04:16.399
No, no.
He wants twice the value. But...

04:16.480 --> 04:18.839
Listen. Stop tellin' me what to do
with the money, please?

04:18.920 --> 04:20.522
I've got a plan for
the board meeting that's

04:20.523 --> 04:22.160
gonna take the gun right
out ofJordan's hand.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.880
<i>Listen, you've got the money now.
And you know my price.</i>

04:24.960 --> 04:26.800
You don't need
a whistle-blower around here.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.200
Interesting choice of words,
Mr. Jordan.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.240
<i>He's right.
We don't need a whistle-blower.</i>

04:31.360 --> 04:35.240
We need a building full
of whistle-blowers.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.160
<i>Okay? Whistles.</i>

04:37.280 --> 04:41.080
<i>I want this place to be honest. That's
exactly why I had these made up for us.</i>

04:41.160 --> 04:44.360
When you see something wrong, I wa...

04:44.480 --> 04:47.120
There you go. I want you to report it.
I want you to...

04:47.200 --> 04:50.040
Exactly. Just like that.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.040
I want us to police
ourselves as vigilant...

04:52.160 --> 04:54.760
Let's wait till something actually happens
though. Okay, good fun.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.680
All right.
Hey. Enough!

04:56.800 --> 04:59.400
45, 46, 47...

04:59.520 --> 05:01.680
Okay, there's still
three whistles left out there.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.000
Who's got the whistles?

05:04.120 --> 05:04.736
- He kept one.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.760
- There's a good example of whistle
-blowing.

05:06.880 --> 05:10.600
But you've kept yours,
so it's hurting your case.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.960
I was in the bathroom
when you asked for it back.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.160
<i>- No, he wasn't.
- In any event...</i>

05:15.240 --> 05:17.280
we are going to be
responsible with this money.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.600
Michael, I hope I'm not
interrupting anything...

05:19.680 --> 05:24.280
but I'd love to get a hunk
of that new company money.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.640
I just need to prove to my wife
that I can act like a man.

05:28.720 --> 05:32.920
And it's not about sex. I don't just
lie there, if that's what you're thinking.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.800
<i>- That's not what I was thinking.
- Sorry, I just...</i>

05:36.920 --> 05:39.400
- A quick question for Michael.
- Is this about the money?

05:39.520 --> 05:42.360
- No!
- What do you want?

05:42.440 --> 05:45.400
It's not about money in the sense that I'm
saying, "Here, Michael, take some money. "

05:45.480 --> 05:49.120
It's just more of a "May I have some?"
kind of visit.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.360
<i>Don't you have a wife
that you can ask now?</i>

05:51.480 --> 05:53.600
- She left me.
- For Tobias?

05:53.720 --> 05:55.520
- For me?
- No!

05:55.640 --> 05:58.880
- She doesn't even like you.
- I'm in love with your brother-in-law.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.760
<i>You're in love with your own brother?
The one in the army?</i>

06:01.880 --> 06:04.800
- No. Your sister's husband.
- Michael? Michael!

06:04.920 --> 06:07.200
- No, that's your sister's brother.
- I'm my sister's brother.

06:07.320 --> 06:10.640
<i>- You're in love with me. Me!
- I'm in love with Tobias.</i>

06:10.720 --> 06:13.600
- My brother-in-law?
- I know it can never be. So I'm leaving.

06:13.720 --> 06:16.240
- I'm enlisting in the army.
- To be with your brother.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.480
- No!
- Anyway, I can't be expected to live...

06:18.560 --> 06:21.240
on the $800-a-month army-wife
stipend that I'm gonna get.

06:21.320 --> 06:23.520
They just don't
support the spouses.

06:23.640 --> 06:27.880
You don't want to end up like Uncle Oscar,
okay? Living off handouts your whole life.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.760
Why don't you come up
with a way to make money?

06:29.880 --> 06:33.040
<i>A suggestion of something to invest in,
or maybe, uh, maybe a business idea?</i>

06:33.120 --> 06:35.840
<i>Well, I've always wanted
to remake Annie Hall.</i>

06:35.960 --> 06:40.480
Except I wouldn't want to get in bed with a
green producer like a Sofia Coppola though.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.040
Oh, but give me an old pro,
like a Robert Redford?

06:43.160 --> 06:45.720
Oh, I'd jump into bed
with him in a second.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.040
And I wouldn't just lie there,
Michael Bluth...

06:49.120 --> 06:50.333
- if that's what you're thinking.

06:50.334 --> 06:52.280
- Actually, that time that
was what I was thinking.

06:52.360 --> 06:56.960
<i>And later that day, Maeby
spotted something interesting.</i>

07:01.280 --> 07:05.760
<i>Lindsay, meanwhile, arrived at the salon
hoping to increase her self-esteem.</i>

07:05.880 --> 07:09.440
<i>Unfortunately, her stylist hadjust been
called up by his reserve unit.</i>

07:09.520 --> 07:11.840
- What's happening? Where are you going?
- I'm not allowed to tell.

07:11.960 --> 07:12.976
- It's the war.

07:12.977 --> 07:16.160
- Come on! These salon
wars have got to stop!

07:16.280 --> 07:18.800
The war, Lindsay. The real war.

07:18.880 --> 07:22.000
<i>Lindsay was stunned, notjust
that she was losing her stylist...</i>

07:22.080 --> 07:24.600
<i>but that apparently,
there was a war going on.</i>

07:24.720 --> 07:27.360
Well, I'm protesting this war.
You're my friend...

07:27.480 --> 07:29.560
and I'm not gonna let
Shauna cut my hair.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.640
I'm going to take a stand.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.640
<i>And Lindsay found a solution
to her self-esteem problem.</i>

07:34.720 --> 07:38.520
<i>Gob and Tobias, meanwhile, were
brainstorming at a local coffee shop.</i>

07:38.640 --> 07:41.120
- I need a cup of coffee to focus.
- It's so crowded in here.

07:41.240 --> 07:45.200
I can't think. Okay.
What is it that people need?

07:45.280 --> 07:47.520
People love to carbo-load.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.840
- The bagel place.
- There you go.

07:49.920 --> 07:53.560
- Hey, guys. What's goin' on?
- Just researching our investment.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.360
Oh, yeah. Coffee places.
I've thought about these.

07:56.480 --> 08:00.000
I'll tell you what. You guys come up
with a proposal, we'll try one.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.400
<i>Gob and Tobias accidentally
had Michael on the hook...</i>

08:02.520 --> 08:04.880
<i>and they didn't want to blow the deal.</i>

08:12.440 --> 08:14.240
I guess that's a response.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.000
- Hey, Nephew.
- Oh, hey!

08:17.120 --> 08:18.920
Uncle Oscar.
How are you doin'?

08:19.040 --> 08:21.480
Wow, you are like, like a rock.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.920
- Oh, the tension! Come on.
- Oh, okay. That's plenty.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.560
- Okay. That's the pancreas right there.
- What's happening now?

08:26.680 --> 08:28.600
<i>The two men reconnected...</i>

08:28.680 --> 08:30.741
<i>- neither one anxious to
bring up the issue at hand.</i>

08:30.742 --> 08:31.440
- One on the lips.

08:31.520 --> 08:32.835
Obviously, Dad's in prison now.

08:32.836 --> 08:35.039
I'm running the business
a little bit differently.

08:35.159 --> 08:37.200
- You do the best with what you have.
- Yeah.

08:37.280 --> 08:40.799
- I have lemons, I make lemonade.
- That's a very positive attitude.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.089
I hate the lemonade
business. I hate the grind.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.400
You have to grind so many...

08:44.480 --> 08:44.774
- lemons.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.440
- You're not a very
metaphorical person, are you?

08:46.560 --> 08:49.200
- I need money.
- I know.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.400
Ah, I cannot tell you how
that has weighed on me.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.640
Mm.

08:54.720 --> 08:58.360
Why don't we sit over here?

08:58.440 --> 09:03.160
So I've got too many people
watching me too closely.

09:03.240 --> 09:07.040
So, if you're willing to work,
or if you have something of value...

09:07.160 --> 09:09.640
The only thing I have
of value is my land.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.240
I could give you the rights to
"All You Need Are Smiles. "

09:12.320 --> 09:13.863
<i>That was a song I
wrote for David Cassidy;</i>

09:13.864 --> 09:15.440
he was gonna sing it on
The Mike Douglas Show.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.040
But he was too embarrassed
to do it in front ofJohn and Yoko.

09:18.120 --> 09:21.440
- Tell me about the land.
- It's a couple hundred acres...

09:21.560 --> 09:23.680
of lemon groves,
right near Camp Pendleton.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.160
If you're willing to part
with that land, Uncle Oscar...

09:26.240 --> 09:29.480
I can guarantee you a little bit more
than that $10,000.

09:29.600 --> 09:33.320
<i>To be honest, I've often thought of
giving it up to pursue my... my lost love.</i>

09:34.520 --> 09:36.600
The love that was taken from me.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.000
I hope that was the espresso machine.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.560
<i>Michael made the trip
to survey the land.</i>

09:42.680 --> 09:45.360
<i>It was, indeed, beautiful.</i>

09:45.440 --> 09:48.520
<i>And the next day, he went
to his father to tell him.</i>

09:48.640 --> 09:50.440
- You give that gift to my brother?
- Gift? No.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.240
I did not give him a gift. I told you.
The money was for investing...

09:53.320 --> 09:55.190
- and that's exactly
what I did with it, Pop.

09:55.191 --> 09:55.800
- Oh, Michael!

09:55.880 --> 09:58.120
This guy has got nothing in his life.
He wrote one song that...

09:58.240 --> 10:01.280
madeJoan Baez call him
"the shallowest man in the world. "

10:01.400 --> 10:04.880
He has a worthless piece of property
and, yes, a head of hair...

10:04.960 --> 10:07.000
only because he's never
had to work for a living.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.153
- Wait. What piece of
property's worthless?

10:09.154 --> 10:10.520
- The grove. Where he lives.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.720
I mean, you can't build on it.
The government has an easement on it.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.320
- Does Oscar know this?
- Of course he knows it.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.840
I mean, they run their...
their tanks through there.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.480
Occasionally, they stop for
a little lemonade, but what's that?

10:21.600 --> 10:23.600
That's a buck fifty.
You can't make much from that.

10:23.680 --> 10:27.640
<i>Indeed, the land was valueless.</i>

10:27.720 --> 10:31.760
Fellas! Fellas!

10:31.840 --> 10:34.480
So. Tell me about
this investment you made.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.280
<i>Back at the model home,
Lindsay had decided...</i>

10:42.400 --> 10:45.040
<i>not to take her stylist's
departure lying down.</i>

10:45.120 --> 10:48.480
I'm protesting the war.
There's a war going on, you know?

10:48.600 --> 10:51.200
Yeah, I'm the one who told you, and
you said it happened ten years ago.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.440
Hey, isn't this the same sign you used
to picket the cable company...

10:53.560 --> 10:56.200
- when they dropped the Style Network?
- Actually, I used this one...

10:56.320 --> 10:58.760
for Michael when he was too cheap
to pay for the premium channels.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.560
But I added the bit
about the stylists.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.360
You know that secret you have?

11:05.440 --> 11:07.440
The one about the hair
that nobody's supposed to see?

11:07.520 --> 11:10.720
- Hai...
- I saw it.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.560
- Oh.
- I saw Pop-Pop.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.800
Oh, right.
Pop-Pop with hair.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.800
- You know, I should tell my dad about...
- No, you...

11:18.880 --> 11:20.960
He might need us to help him,
so we should go check out the prison...

11:21.080 --> 11:23.120
and make sure he's not there.

11:23.200 --> 11:27.200
Oh. Hey, you know, I got cable.
You won that one!

11:27.320 --> 11:30.240
<i>Michael was embarrassed about
the bad investment he'd made...</i>

11:30.360 --> 11:32.360
<i>and was hoping
to keep it a secret.</i>

11:32.480 --> 11:35.480
Hi, this is Oscar. I'm off,
pursuing my lady love.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.080
Leave a message.
I'll get back to you next summer.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.720
Hey, it's Michael. I know that you think
that you've disappeared...

11:40.800 --> 11:43.040
but I will find you.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.240
<i>- Who's disappeared?
- No one.</i>

11:45.320 --> 11:47.400
- Why do you ask? Have you seen someone?
- I've seen no one.

11:47.520 --> 11:50.200
<i>- Then you haven't seen anyone
that looks like Pop-Pop. - No. Why?</i>

11:50.280 --> 11:53.000
<i>Has someone... who looks
like Pop-Pop disappeared?</i>

11:53.120 --> 11:55.600
No. Course not.

11:57.560 --> 11:59.680
Have you seen the agricultural report?

11:59.800 --> 12:03.840
Nothing's hotter than coffee,
so... the trend is up.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.760
So, if we could get
that check from you...

12:05.880 --> 12:08.440
I'm not just gonna
hand out a check, okay?

12:08.520 --> 12:10.360
You gotta come up
with an investment plan.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.920
- You gotta call...
- Oh, we've got an investment plan.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.200
- "Gobias Industries. "
- Go bias.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.360
- Hmm?
- As in, "Go buy us some coffee. "

12:19.520 --> 12:21.440
It's great. Looks good.

12:21.560 --> 12:24.360
So, when do I start
makin' my moneys?

12:24.480 --> 12:30.000
Well, um, there, uh... there may not be
as much investment capital as we thought.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.200
Uh, money's kind of
tied up in this land deal.

12:33.280 --> 12:37.440
This is the first any of us at Gobias
Industries have heard of a land deal.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.640
<i>- We could borrow on that land.
- There's not much to borrow against.</i>

12:40.760 --> 12:42.600
The deal seems to be bad.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.760
<i>It's Uncle Oscar's land,
and it may be worthless.</i>

12:45.880 --> 12:48.320
- And the board okayed it?
- They weren't notified.

12:48.440 --> 12:51.720
Damn it! Every time,
Dad does this to us.

12:51.840 --> 12:55.200
- Gob, Dad really wasn't...
- He went around you, around the board...

12:55.320 --> 12:57.800
- He steamrolled Gobias.
- Yeah, what are you gonna do?

12:57.920 --> 13:00.160
Go down to that prison
and give him a piece of my mind.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.200
- You don't need to do that.
- No, I'm doing it!

13:02.280 --> 13:04.200
No, because you're in charge now.
And I'm telling him that.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.560
No, no, no, no.
Listen, Gob, he's human.

13:06.640 --> 13:11.040
He's a human being, and... let-let me try
to get us out of this, you know?

13:11.160 --> 13:12.960
Let me just see if I
can get Dad out of this

13:12.961 --> 13:14.720
mess that he has created
for himself, okay?

13:14.840 --> 13:19.040
I'm afraid... this offer
comes off the table...

13:19.120 --> 13:21.080
at midnight tonight.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.680
Maybe the worst bluff
I've ever seen.

13:23.800 --> 13:27.440
<i>Even the members of Gobias
agreed on that one.</i>

13:27.520 --> 13:31.880
<i>The next day, Lindsay, having heard
about a military exercise...</i>

13:32.000 --> 13:35.840
<i>joined a protest group and went off to
exercise her own First Amendment rights.</i>

13:35.960 --> 13:38.200
This way! Thank you!

13:38.280 --> 13:40.160
Right here. This way.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.920
I ask you to make sure you're fully inside
the free speech zone...

13:43.040 --> 13:45.880
- before beginning your protest.
- Free speech zone?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.360
This is where we're protesting?
This isn't right. Where are the cameras?

13:48.480 --> 13:50.960
<i>They're in the free press zone, and if
you could save your comments until...</i>

13:51.040 --> 13:53.400
you're completely loaded into the cage...

13:53.480 --> 13:56.160
Well, at least the procession will come
through here. They'll see us protest.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.080
Actually, they're using their right
to cut through the lemon grove.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.360
Okay, have fun, enjoy
your right to free speech.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.520
The armed forces
welcomes your dissent.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.400
Well, hopefully somebody
will come by we can protest.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.920
My grandkids. What a surprise.

14:14.040 --> 14:14.804
- Oh, he's here.

14:14.805 --> 14:17.000
- Of course I'm here.
Where else would I be?

14:17.120 --> 14:20.160
Well, we thought you broke out of prison
and were on the lam with stolen hair.

14:20.280 --> 14:23.200
Don't you think that if I got out of here,
I might want to go home?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.208
That's what we thought.

14:24.209 --> 14:26.600
But then my dad told us about
that lemon grove you bought...

14:26.720 --> 14:28.520
- and we thought you were going there.
- Yeah, but don't worry.

14:28.640 --> 14:31.200
We would never blow the whistle on family.

14:31.320 --> 14:34.040
What lemon grove?

14:34.120 --> 14:36.040
<i>And so, Michael went back to the board...</i>

14:36.160 --> 14:38.400
<i>to take responsibility for his mistake.</i>

14:38.520 --> 14:41.640
My dad screwed up. He bought something
that he shouldn't have.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.960
But I guess... guess that's why
he's behind bars.

14:44.040 --> 14:47.440
Yeah. And he's not allowed to conduct
any business from there.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.295
Right, yeah.

14:48.296 --> 14:51.200
I was involved. It
wasn't all his decision.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.080
You see, it was his idea, and then
I carried out the transaction.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.600
That's even worse.
Conspiracy to commit fraud.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.880
'Course, you can always
buy me off the board.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.960
We don't have the money anymore.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.520
And I assure you that nothing
illegal has happened here.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.440
I've misspoke.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.840
My dad in no way is talking
about business from prison.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.160
<i>Excuse me.
Your father's calling from prison.</i>

15:12.240 --> 15:15.480
He wants to talk about the land deal
you made with his brother.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.360
I found this on your desk.
Can I keep this?

15:23.040 --> 15:25.241
<i>Back at the free speech zone, Lindsay's</i>

15:25.242 --> 15:27.600
protest had started
to gain some attention.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.520
<i>But not from any key decision makers.</i>

15:29.600 --> 15:32.960
- Thought we were seein' a gay marriage.
- We can still hose 'em down.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.040
What do we want?

15:35.160 --> 15:37.200
<i>What do we want?</i>

15:39.280 --> 15:41.120
Where's everyone going?

15:41.240 --> 15:44.520
<i>- What, are you giving up?
- Face it, Lindsay. They've won.</i>

15:44.640 --> 15:46.440
Well, I'm not going anywhere!

15:46.560 --> 15:49.640
All your water's doing is
whetting my appetite for protest.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.400
No hair for oil!
No hair for oil!

15:52.480 --> 15:54.400
Fine! We'll drown you out with music.

15:54.520 --> 15:58.240
Crank it up! I'm in the mood to dance!

16:02.920 --> 16:06.600
<i>And Lindsay discovered that
the activism that came out...</i>

16:06.720 --> 16:10.600
<i>ofher desire for prettier hair
really did boost her self-esteem.</i>

16:10.720 --> 16:12.760
<i>While Michael,
with nowhere else to turn...</i>

16:12.880 --> 16:15.200
<i>made a rare, unsolicited visit
to his mother's.</i>

16:15.320 --> 16:17.120
<i>- Michael?
- Yeah.</i>

16:17.240 --> 16:20.200
I hope you're here to bring me
a check for Buster's surgery.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.792
They made him stop
eating after midnight,

16:21.793 --> 16:23.440
and he's hungry, and
he's in a foreign land...

16:23.520 --> 16:25.760
and his jaw is clicking,
and he's scared.

16:25.880 --> 16:28.960
- I don't have the money. All right, Mom?
- Then why are you here?

16:29.080 --> 16:30.960
I don't know.
I don't know.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.120
So, how's work?

16:38.240 --> 16:40.880
It's-It's not great, Mom, since you asked.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.040
It's-It's just...
It's not that great, you know?

16:43.160 --> 16:45.120
I got a board member
who's trying to extort me...

16:45.240 --> 16:48.520
and a seller I can't find... this whole
real estate thing is a total mess...

16:48.640 --> 16:50.720
- I got Dad completely...
- What did your father do?

16:50.840 --> 16:52.707
- Did he try to screw
something up for you again?

16:52.708 --> 16:53.080
- No, no.

16:53.160 --> 16:55.040
<i>He didn't screw anything up.
I screwed something up, Mom.</i>

16:55.120 --> 16:58.920
I- I did it, and Dad is just,
you know, furious at me.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.560
And he should be, you know? He told me
to pay off his brother, and I didn't.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.560
Instead, I bought his worthless land.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.079
- With the lemons and the tanks?
- I know it!

17:06.200 --> 17:09.119
First investment I made with the company
money, and it's a total disaster.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.079
Then I went ahead and lied about it,
which is gonna let this board member...

17:12.160 --> 17:14.319
bring the company down...
I'm gonna ruin this family...

17:14.400 --> 17:17.079
Mom...

17:17.160 --> 17:19.160
What's this? What's happening?

17:19.240 --> 17:22.319
- It's going to be all right.
- Why are you squeezing me with your body?

17:22.400 --> 17:24.319
It's a hug, Michael.
I'm hugging you.

17:24.440 --> 17:27.000
- Why?
- Because you need your mother right now.

17:27.079 --> 17:30.320
But I don't get along with my...
Sorry. That was a knee jerk.

17:30.400 --> 17:34.120
Michael. You made a mistake.
You're a human being.

17:34.240 --> 17:37.440
But you're so forgiving
to everyone else in this family.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.400
Try being forgiving to yourself.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.880
Now, if you'll excuse me.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.840
<i>- Let Mama take care of it.
- No, no.</i>

17:45.920 --> 17:48.640
Mom, come on. I don't want you to do
anything. Hey! This isn't algebra.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.640
<i>I'm a big boy. Mother!
Do not make somebody dis...</i>

17:51.720 --> 17:54.760
disappear.

18:03.680 --> 18:08.600
<i>Now there's someone who could have
used a good mother. Whore!</i>

18:08.680 --> 18:13.360
<i>And so, before Oscar could
leave to find his lady love...</i>

18:13.440 --> 18:15.680
<i>- Oscar!
- She found him.</i>

18:15.800 --> 18:19.840
Lucille!
You look fantastic!

18:19.960 --> 18:22.200
You still have the neck
of a 20-year-old.

18:22.280 --> 18:25.320
And you still have the hair of a lion.

18:25.440 --> 18:29.120
Take back the land.

18:29.240 --> 18:33.000
That's it?
But I-I thought we could have...

18:33.120 --> 18:36.640
this brief moment to... reconnect.

18:36.760 --> 18:39.520
Oscar. Your brother
is in jail right now.

18:39.640 --> 18:43.000
- My husband is in jail.
- You're right.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.240
So what's the rush?

18:48.840 --> 18:51.200
<i>- And, the next day...
- Michael!</i>

18:51.320 --> 18:53.680
Hey, Mom! Hi. Listen.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.160
I'm sorry about yesterday.
It was a moment of weakness.

18:56.240 --> 18:59.040
Now I-I gotta go into this board meeting.
I'm just gonna tell them the truth.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.600
If this guyJordan wants to try to get
me fired, then maybe I deserve it.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.320
He's gone.
We bought out his shares.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.242
- With what?

19:05.243 --> 19:09.120
- With the money you tried
to spend on that lemon grove.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.080
You got it back. How?

19:14.880 --> 19:19.080
You know about what I was saying about
how people outlive their usefulness?

19:19.200 --> 19:22.080
- That was out of line.
- I know.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.280
But you made a good point.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.960
Maybe I do need something to occupy
my time, other than my children.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.720
Well, if you do want to spend it
together, it's fine with me.

19:30.840 --> 19:33.840
I'm so glad to hear that.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.520
All right.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.680
<i>Let's get this meeting started.</i>

19:43.800 --> 19:47.960
Why have we been spending
so much money on whistles?

19:50.240 --> 19:52.360
<i>On the next
Arrested Development...</i>

19:52.480 --> 19:55.520
<i>Michael finds having his mother
on the board problematic.</i>

19:55.640 --> 19:56.975
- We have to be courageous.

19:56.976 --> 19:59.200
- I remember a young
man who used to say...

19:59.320 --> 20:02.240
<i>"But I don't have bad dreams in your bed!"</i>

20:02.360 --> 20:04.960
That was Buster.

20:05.080 --> 20:08.120
- I want to be...

20:08.200 --> 20:12.000
a cage dancer.

20:12.120 --> 20:15.560
<i>And Oscar comes a-courtin.</i>

20:15.680 --> 20:17.600
What's that racket?

20:26.840 --> 20:28.640
<i>Smile.</i>

20:29.305 --> 20:35.493
