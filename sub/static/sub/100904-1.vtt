WEBVTT

01:56.716 --> 01:58.119
Oh, fuck.

01:59.219 --> 02:01.322
Whoo!

02:28.682 --> 02:31.252
Shit.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.388
I still can't believe he
fucking fought back like that.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.590
Can't believe
you shot him.

02:37.592 --> 02:39.761
Hope it was worth it.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.831
Did you check?

02:52.240 --> 02:54.673
How much is it?
Is it enough?

02:54.675 --> 02:58.343
- Hold on a sec, damn it.
- Well, it's gotta be more than we need.

02:58.345 --> 03:02.480
- Has to be.
- Maybe about 20K.

03:02.482 --> 03:05.820
Old Billy Boy's definitely
snakin' from the top.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.723
I told you
he had it coming.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.224
Ah... All right.

03:13.226 --> 03:15.460
We gotta get
to the border tonight.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.728
When they find that body
in the morning,

03:16.730 --> 03:18.430
they're gonna come
looking for us.

03:18.432 --> 03:21.533
Straight to Mexico.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.902
Yeah.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.174
Straight to Mexico.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.745
Think we'll have enough
for that beach house?

03:32.747 --> 03:34.847
Keep dreaming.

03:34.849 --> 03:37.316
Oh, come on.
Something right on the sand.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.617
Okay, right on it.

03:39.619 --> 03:40.889
I gotta learn to surf.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.860
You got a lot to learn, buddy.

04:38.712 --> 04:41.981
You're born, you go to school,

04:41.983 --> 04:44.450
get a job, get married,

04:44.452 --> 04:48.723
and you're supposed to do
one thing after the other.

04:50.323 --> 04:53.691
And in the end,
you get what you want.

04:53.693 --> 04:57.263
I don't know what you
want me to say, Rich.

04:57.265 --> 04:58.832
Best laid plans
and all that.

05:00.835 --> 05:03.469
Well, thanks for getting me
a job at the clinic.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.802
Oh, of course.

05:04.804 --> 05:08.640
You know, I know
it's not big city hospital.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.876
It's not as exciting, but...

05:10.878 --> 05:12.945
it's enough to get you
and Jan back on your feet.

05:12.947 --> 05:14.482
Yeah.

05:24.291 --> 05:27.325
He threw away
his entire career.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.628
Took one mistake
and let 'em beat him with it.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.862
Jan...

05:30.864 --> 05:33.866
All of that work
for nothing.

05:33.868 --> 05:36.001
He didn't even fight it.

05:36.003 --> 05:39.470
He meant well,
even if he didn't show it right.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.539
Yeah.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.910
I'm gonna start
on Biology next week.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.611
I'm just waiting
on the textbooks.

05:46.613 --> 05:50.782
I can't have Riley
falling too far behind.

05:50.784 --> 05:54.486
It's only things, stuff.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.655
You can buy new stuff.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.026
A new house.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.828
Thank you
for letting us stay here.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.030
Just a few more months.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.368
Our home is your home.

06:08.902 --> 06:12.371
Man, you really need a lawyer
for this stuff, Rich.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.873
Can't afford a lawyer.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.477
What does Dad
have to say about that?

06:20.580 --> 06:22.549
He sees it
as a personal insult.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.846
Mm. Thanks, sis.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.080
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Mm.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.000
Hey, Pops.

07:16.036 --> 07:20.104
Listen, I just wanted to thank you
for letting us stay at your place.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.808
And I wanted to let you know

07:22.810 --> 07:25.576
that I finished
the last of the papers.

07:25.578 --> 07:26.845
So...

07:26.847 --> 07:28.549
What do you
want me to say, Rich?

07:30.584 --> 07:32.354
"Congratulations"?

07:34.822 --> 07:36.691
You fucked up.

07:38.092 --> 07:41.092
You act like I had a choice.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.496
What was I supposed to do?

07:43.931 --> 07:46.664
Take it to court,
drag it out for years?

07:46.666 --> 07:48.900
I couldn't put
my family through that.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.835
Suppose I was
one of your patients?

07:50.837 --> 07:53.838
- Oh, Dad, come on!
- Just suppose.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.610
Just stitch me up.

07:57.912 --> 08:00.849
There's a 50/50 chance
that I'll pull through.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.952
But what do you tell me?

08:06.553 --> 08:07.955
I'd tell you to fight.

08:08.955 --> 08:12.025
Yeah. Right.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.763
But that is not always the
answer, you know?

08:17.630 --> 08:20.568
Sometimes you gotta know
when you've lost.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.837
I lost.

08:24.839 --> 08:29.110
Spoken like someone who is
just used to being a loser.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.113
It's funny how
your version of winning

08:35.115 --> 08:38.553
always has you at the front
and your family somewhere else.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.922
I won't do that to mine.

08:55.669 --> 08:59.104
- And now, the piece de resistance.
- Oh, my God.

08:59.106 --> 09:02.941
- Authentic vegetarian lasagna.
- I'm starving.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.643
- Oh, thank you.
- I got the recipe off the internet.

09:05.645 --> 09:09.614
If it mattered to you so
much, why didn't you say something?

09:09.616 --> 09:12.084
I said we should have
got a lawyer.

09:15.755 --> 09:19.624
Frank, it's okay.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.192
Don't worry, Riley.

09:21.194 --> 09:25.029
Your granddaddy and I
used to argue all the time.

09:25.031 --> 09:26.297
Didn't we, honey?

09:26.299 --> 09:28.533
These things pass.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.003
Come here.
Have something to eat.

09:36.943 --> 09:39.545
Rich, I love you,

09:39.547 --> 09:43.080
but I need to know
that you're still in this,

09:43.082 --> 09:45.786
that I am not
doing this on my own.

09:47.721 --> 09:51.860
Hey... Hey, you're not...

09:53.961 --> 09:55.663
You're not.

09:56.996 --> 09:58.198
You're not.

09:59.900 --> 10:04.739
Because if I am, then maybe
I should be on my own.

10:09.143 --> 10:10.745
Jan.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.307
It's hot as balls
out here.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.013
I wanna get to the
state line by midnight.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.621
Put some money on two,
all right?

10:57.223 --> 10:59.391
Hey...
what are you doing?

10:59.393 --> 11:01.325
Hey, hey, hey, relax.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.628
Jesus... Fucking money
everywhere.

11:03.630 --> 11:04.896
- Are you crazy?
- Relax.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.330
- It's not going anywhere.
- Jesus.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.901
And don't forget my beer.

11:09.035 --> 11:10.070
God!

11:12.673 --> 11:14.075
Idiot.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.248
Lookin' for something?

11:57.250 --> 11:59.283
Just checking the merchandise.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.356
Everything okay
with you, bud?

12:11.331 --> 12:13.768
Yeah... bud.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.305
Hey, you one
of the Granger boys?

12:22.875 --> 12:23.910
Who's asking?

12:25.111 --> 12:27.112
I... I went to school
with your brother.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.080
He was a good kid.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.885
Uh, it's a shame
what happened.

12:34.788 --> 12:37.788
- Pump number two.
- That... that all?

12:37.790 --> 12:39.490
Yeah, you got a shitter?

12:39.492 --> 12:41.028
Out back.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.038
Oh, fuck.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.441
- Jamie!
- Hey, stay there!

12:56.443 --> 12:58.877
Stay there,
and flank the bastard.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.811
- What the hell are you doing?
- I don't know, it was...

13:00.813 --> 13:02.114
It was a spur of the moment
kinda thing.

13:02.116 --> 13:03.481
I couldn't pass it up.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.484
Please! I have a baby!

13:05.486 --> 13:07.085
Jamie, what about the cameras?

13:07.087 --> 13:08.386
Relax, they're not on.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.088
The cops are on the way!

13:10.090 --> 13:13.291
Your dumb ass didn't get
anywhere near that alarm!

13:13.293 --> 13:14.960
Throw down your gun
and come out!

13:14.962 --> 13:16.927
We'll tape you and the girl up,
and we'll go!

13:16.929 --> 13:19.830
We'll get out of here. You'll never
see us again. I give you my word.

13:19.832 --> 13:21.836
No fucking way, scumbags!

13:25.438 --> 13:29.106
All right, no more
fucking around, asshole.

13:29.108 --> 13:31.509
Come out now,
or I'm gonna kill this bitch.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.277
You have five seconds!

13:33.279 --> 13:34.513
- Five...
- I have a baby! Please!

13:34.515 --> 13:36.047
Jamie, don't do this.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.415
- Please. I won't tell anybody.
- Four!

13:37.417 --> 13:39.151
I won't tell anybody.
Please, just let me go home.

13:39.153 --> 13:41.485
- Three!
- Just let me go home, please.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.555
- Two! Come on, asshole.
- I won't tell anybody.

13:43.557 --> 13:45.056
He's not gonna do it.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.524
You want her kid
growing up without a mom?

13:46.526 --> 13:49.994
- Jamie, don't do this.
- Please.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.064
One.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.237
- Jamie...
- Sons of bitches!

13:59.239 --> 14:00.975
Motherfuckers!

14:16.890 --> 14:18.989
Jesus Christ, Jamie!
What'd you do?

14:18.991 --> 14:20.892
I don't know. I just saw
the register and the cash.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.460
- I thought we could...
- I meant the girl!

14:22.462 --> 14:24.532
Goddamn!

14:26.098 --> 14:27.431
I didn't mean for it
to get all fucked up.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.500
I just thought
we could get the money.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.138
Just shut up!

14:33.140 --> 14:35.574
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.

14:35.576 --> 14:37.845
Come over here.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.546
Oh, shit, I'm so sorry.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.981
- Help me up.
- Oh, fuck.

14:43.983 --> 14:46.417
Okay, help me up.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.018
Oh...

15:30.197 --> 15:33.565
You know,
quail season's coming.

15:33.567 --> 15:35.399
You wanna go hunting?

15:35.401 --> 15:37.003
Um, hell yeah.

15:38.005 --> 15:40.571
I mean, yes.

15:40.573 --> 15:44.042
Your dad was your age
when I took him.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.210
I remember.

15:46.212 --> 15:49.446
Can I go, Mom? Please?

15:49.448 --> 15:53.618
The joys of having a
former sheriff as your father.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.619
I'm sure Frank
will take good care of her.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.489
Well, I can't promise
she's gonna shoot straight.

15:59.927 --> 16:02.296
Unless talent
skips a generation.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.096
Excuse me,
I wasn't that bad.

16:06.098 --> 16:07.465
You know that.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.100
Learned from the best.

16:10.102 --> 16:12.003
That's true.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.339
Rich,
it's the clinic.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.110
Alice says
they need you now.

16:17.376 --> 16:19.978
And duty calls.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.414
Eat your greens, Riley.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.734
I'm dying, Jamie.
I'm fuckin' dying.

16:42.736 --> 16:44.970
No, don't even say it.

16:44.972 --> 16:47.138
That bullet, it just...

16:47.140 --> 16:49.040
It just hit your leg.
It's-it's...

16:51.044 --> 16:53.948
It must've hit
something important.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.516
What do we do?

16:58.518 --> 17:00.654
We gotta get
as far away as possible.

17:02.621 --> 17:06.256
We have until dawn
until they find the store.

17:06.258 --> 17:08.560
Once that happens,
they're gonna set up roadblocks,

17:08.562 --> 17:10.197
and we're fucked.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.132
You really think they'd go
to all that trouble?

17:15.134 --> 17:16.667
They're gonna be
looking for us.

17:16.669 --> 17:20.170
They're gonna be looking
for us hard after what you did.

17:20.172 --> 17:21.773
You don't have
to stay on it like that.

17:21.775 --> 17:23.410
I said I'm sorry.

17:25.144 --> 17:28.181
- Oh, I need a doctor.
- Fuck.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.549
No.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.717
No, those hospital bitches
will report it.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.456
I got a plan.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.391
I think that we should...
we should just keep going and...

17:40.393 --> 17:42.127
Just keep driving.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.130
Just keep driving.

17:51.537 --> 17:53.471
Thanks for coming in
on such short notice.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.143
Here to the rescue.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.311
Hey, hey, be careful.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.147
Just hang on, bro.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.517
Two weeks from now,
we're gonna be laughing about this.

18:13.325 --> 18:15.627
...I've ever been through.

18:15.629 --> 18:18.562
God, there was
so much bleeding. So much!

18:18.564 --> 18:22.599
He... It's actually a miracle he didn't
die the moment he hit the ground.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.334
We induced a coma...

18:24.336 --> 18:27.071
I'm sorry, sir.
We're closed for the day.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.273
If it's an emergency,
you have to head into the city.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.209
- Took like six hours.
- You saved his life.

18:32.211 --> 18:35.281
Well, he was
one of the lucky ones.

18:38.384 --> 18:40.484
Look, Rich, I know you
don't wanna hear this,

18:40.486 --> 18:42.654
but you can still
make a difference here.

18:44.858 --> 18:47.157
Uh, I gotta get going.

18:53.199 --> 18:54.631
Is that him?

18:54.633 --> 18:56.469
Yeah, that's him.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.242
Fucking brilliant, Matty!

19:37.244 --> 19:41.146
This is gonna work.
I can feel it.

19:41.148 --> 19:43.617
That last line,
I won't get another chance.

19:45.485 --> 19:48.386
- Just hang on, bro, you hear me?
- Yeah.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.857
Just hang on.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.272
I haven't seen
a house for miles.

20:07.274 --> 20:09.674
What'd you go and get
Grizzly Adams for a doctor?

20:09.676 --> 20:11.408
This is perfect.

20:11.410 --> 20:14.547
Isolated, remote,
no one else around.

20:15.916 --> 20:18.315
We got lucky.

20:18.317 --> 20:21.186
You did good.
You did real good.

20:21.188 --> 20:22.323
Yeah.

20:26.525 --> 20:27.727
Right there.
He's turning.

21:48.742 --> 21:51.345
Not longer
until he falls asleep.

22:41.393 --> 22:42.962
Did you ever wonder?

22:44.531 --> 22:46.400
About?

22:48.634 --> 22:50.436
How we did.

22:53.540 --> 22:57.478
We did the best
we could.

22:59.746 --> 23:03.648
We weren't perfect,
but no one is.

23:03.650 --> 23:06.019
Well, tell that
to your son.

23:08.455 --> 23:11.555
Sweetheart...

23:11.557 --> 23:15.592
Oh, baby,
I could've done much better.

23:15.594 --> 23:17.829
Rich does not need
a lecture.

23:17.831 --> 23:21.499
He needs you to listen,
to be there.

23:21.501 --> 23:24.502
He knows I am.

23:24.504 --> 23:27.571
It wouldn't hurt to tell him
every now and then.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.474
I listen to...

23:29.476 --> 23:31.509
Why do you always
have to be right?

23:31.511 --> 23:34.846
What would you
do without me?

23:34.848 --> 23:39.516
Oh, I can't even remember
where my socks are without you.

23:39.518 --> 23:41.886
- Oh, please.
- Baby...

23:41.888 --> 23:44.324
- I love you.
- I can't live without you.

23:45.557 --> 23:47.060
Hey.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.895
Yeah?

23:50.897 --> 23:54.432
I've been thinking
about everything.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.537
We're talking about it.

24:00.105 --> 24:03.343
Look, we only have to stay here
until the end of summer.

24:05.411 --> 24:07.581
And we'll put
some money away.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.819
I'll open my own practice.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.592
And I'll fix this,
I promise.

24:22.027 --> 24:24.530
But you and Riley...

24:26.999 --> 24:29.001
mean the world to me.

24:49.456 --> 24:50.858
It's time.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.895
All right.

24:57.063 --> 24:59.196
We're gonna do
this one clean.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.968
Just tie 'em up, that's it.
You got it?

25:03.969 --> 25:07.473
Hey.
No killing.

25:09.909 --> 25:12.676
Yeah, well,
what if they run?

25:12.678 --> 25:14.614
Then you
knock 'em down.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.184
You got it? Hey!

25:18.751 --> 25:20.754
Hey, I wanna hear
you say it.

25:22.755 --> 25:24.457
No fucking killing.

25:26.124 --> 25:27.627
I got you, bro.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.157
Oh, shit.

28:48.226 --> 28:49.763
Was that...?

28:51.229 --> 28:52.295
Stay here.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.004
Matty! Hey, Matty!

29:01.006 --> 29:04.108
Matty, help! Matty!
Help me, Matt!

29:04.110 --> 29:05.443
Matty, help!
Matty!

29:11.817 --> 29:13.285
No.

29:17.023 --> 29:18.488
I'm sorry.

29:18.490 --> 29:22.225
Jamie... What'd I
fucking tell you?

29:22.227 --> 29:23.863
What'd I tell you?

29:27.800 --> 29:29.169
Dad?

29:30.870 --> 29:32.903
I swear, it was
a fucking accident.

29:32.905 --> 29:35.876
No.
It was not a fucking accident.

29:37.409 --> 29:40.246
She just fucking walked in the
back, and I reacted. I...

29:41.980 --> 29:44.148
I didn't mean to.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.483
It's okay.

29:51.056 --> 29:53.791
I swear. Please.

29:53.793 --> 29:55.294
Oh, shit, the doc.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.475
- Guys are breaking in.
- What?

30:30.028 --> 30:33.164
The line's dead.
Riley!

30:33.166 --> 30:35.499
Jan, Jan, stay...

30:35.501 --> 30:37.070
Jan.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.878
- Riley.
- Mom.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.182
Baby, you gotta run, okay?
Don't ask any questions.

30:51.184 --> 30:53.884
We just have to...

30:53.886 --> 30:56.086
Mom!

30:56.088 --> 30:58.158
Mom!

31:19.078 --> 31:21.481
Get out of my house.

31:27.486 --> 31:29.956
My brother already has
your wife and kid.

31:31.323 --> 31:35.262
I won't hurt 'em.
I give you my word.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.062
But you pull that trigger,

31:39.064 --> 31:41.500
there's no guarantee
what my brother might do.

31:49.108 --> 31:50.510
Good choice.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.257
That's all of 'em.
Phones have shit reception.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.261
But I grabbed these
just in case.

32:10.263 --> 32:12.899
Do it.
I don't wanna take any chances.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.512
Bring me the doc.

32:31.016 --> 32:32.518
No, leave him alone!

32:35.588 --> 32:38.421
Mom, are we
gonna be okay?

32:38.423 --> 32:41.058
Where's Grandma?

32:41.060 --> 32:42.928
It's gonna be okay.

32:56.074 --> 32:57.409
Where's my mom?

32:59.210 --> 33:00.947
It was an accident.

33:05.951 --> 33:08.888
No. No...

33:13.059 --> 33:14.992
We're not here to hurt anyone.

33:14.994 --> 33:18.329
And we're not gonna
steal anything.

33:18.331 --> 33:21.165
Then why?

33:21.167 --> 33:22.733
I'm bleeding to death,

33:22.735 --> 33:25.002
and I need somebody
to plug this leak,

33:25.004 --> 33:26.473
and you're a doctor.

33:29.207 --> 33:31.742
Not that kind of a doctor.

33:31.744 --> 33:33.444
Meaning what?

33:33.446 --> 33:35.980
I haven't seen the inside
of a leg in ten years.

33:35.982 --> 33:37.918
I can't help you.

33:42.021 --> 33:46.023
You're a lying
piece of shit.

33:46.025 --> 33:48.292
I heard you
at the clinic.

33:48.294 --> 33:52.295
He was talking about stitches
and swelling and surgery.

33:52.297 --> 33:54.398
You know
what you're doing.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.201
I don't operate on legs.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.535
You're gonna have
to find someone else.

33:59.537 --> 34:03.374
There's no time.
Whatever you were before,

34:03.376 --> 34:05.545
tonight you're
a leg surgeon, Doc.

34:08.146 --> 34:09.949
I'll need equipment.

34:11.450 --> 34:14.053
Um, like what?

34:15.354 --> 34:17.122
A knife?

34:19.425 --> 34:21.193
A scalpel.

34:23.595 --> 34:28.568
Uh, I'm gonna need clamps,
a suturing kit.

34:30.102 --> 34:31.401
Where can we get 'em?

34:31.403 --> 34:33.504
Back at the clinic.

34:33.506 --> 34:36.205
What the fuck
did you just say?

34:36.207 --> 34:38.043
We're not going back there.

34:39.778 --> 34:41.313
It's the only way.

34:44.816 --> 34:46.082
Jamie.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.987
Yeah, Matty.

34:49.722 --> 34:51.358
Bring me his wife.

34:56.227 --> 34:57.361
Wait!

34:59.164 --> 35:04.401
There might be
a box of tools in a box.

35:04.403 --> 35:09.539
Uh, just old college tools
in one of the barns.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.075
Let me go check.

35:11.077 --> 35:14.678
You know, I don't know
if you're lying or not,

35:14.680 --> 35:17.381
and I don't really care,

35:17.383 --> 35:23.320
but if you're playing some kinda
trick, and I die,

35:23.322 --> 35:27.794
you're gonna be stuck on
this farm with my brother...

35:30.729 --> 35:33.530
and he already
killed Grandma.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.802
What do you think he's
gonna do to the rest of you?

35:38.671 --> 35:40.673
And you brought him here.

35:49.347 --> 35:53.119
Jamie... get him
out of here.

36:19.912 --> 36:22.812
You don't have
to be afraid.

36:22.814 --> 36:25.548
I'm not gonna hurt you.

36:25.550 --> 36:27.386
It was all
a mistake before.

36:28.753 --> 36:30.789
Mistake?

36:34.559 --> 36:36.628
I never wanted
to hurt anyone.

36:38.197 --> 36:39.765
Without your son,
I'm gonna die.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.204
I've been with scum like you
my whole life.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.173
You're all the same.

36:50.476 --> 36:51.878
No.

36:53.845 --> 36:56.680
You got us all wrong.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.384
Trust me.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.128
It's in one of those.

37:10.863 --> 37:13.399
We get what we came for,
and we're gone.

37:43.494 --> 37:46.165
We used to live
in a house like this.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.633
Wasn't this big, though.

37:49.635 --> 37:51.537
It was just us and Dad.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.640
I coulda left.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.644
Coulda gone to college.

38:01.646 --> 38:03.415
But I stayed.

38:07.852 --> 38:10.490
I was always there for him.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.199
You find it yet?

38:21.700 --> 38:23.336
Give me a minute.

38:25.271 --> 38:26.906
Faster, Doc.

38:28.706 --> 38:30.409
I killed a guy, you know.

38:33.012 --> 38:35.278
What are you yapping about?

38:35.280 --> 38:38.351
You asked me
why I was on this farm.

38:39.952 --> 38:41.888
There was a car accident.

38:43.389 --> 38:44.890
Guy came in.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.392
I cut when I should've
stitched

38:48.394 --> 38:51.827
or stitched
when I should've cut.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.900
I don't even know.

38:55.534 --> 39:00.240
His family sued in civil court,
and I lost everything.

39:01.673 --> 39:02.809
Yeah?

39:05.910 --> 39:08.544
Just remember...

39:08.546 --> 39:11.013
you fuck up
with my brother,

39:11.015 --> 39:14.350
and it's gonna cost you
a lot more than a lawsuit.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.488
Now let's fucking go!

39:31.704 --> 39:33.503
No.

39:33.505 --> 39:35.372
Just stop.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.644
- Please, don't.
- Uh-huh.

39:39.477 --> 39:40.910
You know,
I could've fought it.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.715
I probably would've won.

39:44.048 --> 39:48.353
The truth...
is that they were right.

39:50.923 --> 39:54.524
I fucked up.

39:54.526 --> 39:57.593
I deserved to lose.

39:57.595 --> 39:58.861
No one understands.

39:58.863 --> 40:00.999
Wife doesn't understand,
but I do.

40:03.001 --> 40:07.570
Now here I am,
working at a clinic.

40:07.572 --> 40:10.575
Routine stuff nowadays,
just basic.

40:11.744 --> 40:14.544
They don't even trust me
with the kids.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.783
They don't trust me
with anything.

40:19.151 --> 40:23.120
You really sure that you want me
operating on your brother?

40:23.122 --> 40:25.888
No, I'm not.

40:25.890 --> 40:27.994
But I guess we're both
fucking unlucky tonight.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.128
You done?

40:31.130 --> 40:33.863
Good fucking boy.
Now let's go.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.634
Let's fucking go.

40:36.769 --> 40:38.869
- Ah, shit.
- What the fuck?

40:42.640 --> 40:44.707
He didn't mean it.

40:44.709 --> 40:45.908
He'll be good.

40:45.910 --> 40:47.811
Then we just get out of here.

40:47.813 --> 40:49.745
Everything will be okay.

40:49.747 --> 40:52.182
We just need
to get to the border.

40:52.184 --> 40:56.186
Let's just...
Let's get to the border.

41:02.427 --> 41:04.727
Get up!
Grab the shit!

41:08.099 --> 41:10.869
Uh-huh.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.004
Fuck...

41:18.110 --> 41:20.079
I think someone's coming.

41:39.064 --> 41:41.100
- Oh, Matty.
- Dad.

41:42.733 --> 41:45.904
Jan, Riley, Dad,
you okay?

41:46.905 --> 41:50.075
Hey.
How you doing?

41:51.977 --> 41:55.715
It's gonna be all right.
We got the stuff.

41:59.251 --> 42:01.718
Don't do
anything else they say.

42:01.720 --> 42:02.855
You understand?

42:04.555 --> 42:05.856
Okay.

42:05.858 --> 42:08.624
I'm gonna get us
out of this, okay?

42:08.626 --> 42:11.628
Listen, we have
to take control.

42:11.630 --> 42:13.965
I've seen
how these things end.

42:17.635 --> 42:19.005
No, you don't worry
about them.

42:22.139 --> 42:24.476
Just get better.
I'll take care of it.

42:27.613 --> 42:31.584
No killing.
No killing.

42:32.985 --> 42:34.584
You just rest easy, bro.

42:37.956 --> 42:40.624
You're operating, Doc.

42:40.626 --> 42:42.195
Now!

42:44.028 --> 42:45.731
I'll get us out of this.

43:04.983 --> 43:08.988
Now, I'm gonna need some help.
Would you grab my wife?

43:10.322 --> 43:11.590
Not a chance.

43:12.957 --> 43:15.791
When I start cutting
into your brother,

43:15.793 --> 43:20.229
you're gonna have to hold
him down as hard as you can.

43:20.231 --> 43:23.702
So as I said, my wife.

43:32.110 --> 43:34.811
You're a doctor, right?

43:34.813 --> 43:36.148
You swore an oath?

43:37.916 --> 43:39.952
You have to help
my brother.

43:40.952 --> 43:42.954
If he dies...

43:44.856 --> 43:48.026
that's against
your oath, right?

44:03.041 --> 44:05.175
Fine.

44:05.177 --> 44:06.678
Your wife.

44:18.289 --> 44:20.692
You...

44:36.140 --> 44:38.077
Looks like
you're up, old man.

44:41.646 --> 44:44.082
Oh.

44:48.720 --> 44:51.187
You're a tough
son of a bitch, huh?

44:51.189 --> 44:56.295
Used to be the big dog
in town. Yeah.

44:58.262 --> 45:00.799
Bet you got a hard-on for me
after I killed your wife.

45:06.972 --> 45:09.976
Sure you'd like to dance with me
if I gave you the chance.

45:11.742 --> 45:15.378
Just give me
five minutes alone.

45:15.380 --> 45:16.812
Take your fucking head off.

45:16.814 --> 45:18.381
Oh!

45:18.383 --> 45:21.220
Yeah? Yeah?

45:22.921 --> 45:26.088
Yeah, that's what
I fucking thought.

45:26.090 --> 45:30.026
I'm gonna untie you now, and you
better fucking behave, you hear me?

45:30.028 --> 45:32.098
Better fucking behave.

45:35.434 --> 45:37.870
Just walk.

45:41.807 --> 45:44.240
Listen, I don't have
any fucking cuffs for you.

45:44.242 --> 45:45.945
Don't try anything.

45:47.211 --> 45:48.847
Take it easy.

45:50.182 --> 45:54.283
If my brother dies,
I'm gonna kill you.

45:54.285 --> 45:56.785
I'm gonna kill your daughter,

45:56.787 --> 45:58.187
I'm gonna kill your wife,

45:58.189 --> 46:00.191
and I'm gonna kill
your fucking dad.

46:04.496 --> 46:05.930
All right.

46:07.198 --> 46:10.669
When I start cutting,
bite on this.

46:14.271 --> 46:17.073
I need you to hold him down
as best as you can.

46:17.075 --> 46:18.307
- Got it?
- Yeah.

46:18.309 --> 46:20.912
Okay. Dad,
grab his ankles.

46:22.414 --> 46:25.314
- On three.
- Okay. All right.

46:25.316 --> 46:27.950
One... two.

46:27.952 --> 46:29.753
Hey, hey, hey!

46:29.755 --> 46:31.488
Hey, you're fucking
killing him! Hey!

46:31.490 --> 46:32.955
- Hold him.
- Fuck!

46:32.957 --> 46:34.224
Hold him.

46:34.226 --> 46:36.992
It's okay. It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

46:36.994 --> 46:38.863
It's okay...

46:40.298 --> 46:41.830
Doing fine.

46:41.832 --> 46:45.001
All right.
Okay.

46:45.003 --> 46:47.269
It's the femoral artery.

46:47.271 --> 46:49.240
I got it, I got it.

46:50.342 --> 46:53.276
- Ah, yes.
- Fuck.

46:53.278 --> 46:55.113
Oh, fuck.

46:58.383 --> 46:59.885
It's all right.

47:04.356 --> 47:07.157
Hey, come on.
Grab his foot, hold on.

47:07.159 --> 47:08.258
Concentrate.

47:08.260 --> 47:09.392
- Okay, fuck.
- Got it?

47:09.394 --> 47:10.396
Okay! Fuck!

47:11.963 --> 47:14.062
All right.
It's gonna be all right.

47:14.064 --> 47:17.233
It's all right.
Hang on, hang on.

47:21.106 --> 47:22.174
All right.

47:25.110 --> 47:26.878
All right, we got it.

47:28.445 --> 47:31.280
The bleeding's stopped.

47:31.282 --> 47:33.416
We're good?

47:33.418 --> 47:35.218
Nah, I still
gotta sew him up.

47:35.220 --> 47:37.352
Clamp's just holding him
together for now.

47:37.354 --> 47:39.224
He'll die like this.

47:44.461 --> 47:46.595
Oh, fuck.

47:46.597 --> 47:48.133
I told you.

47:51.836 --> 47:52.938
Oh, fuck.

47:56.240 --> 47:57.539
Shit!

48:08.320 --> 48:10.153
Kill my wife?

48:12.858 --> 48:14.323
Dad!

48:27.539 --> 48:30.176
Riley, try to untie me.

49:02.573 --> 49:04.106
Rich, are you okay?

49:04.108 --> 49:05.475
Yeah, I'm fine.

49:05.477 --> 49:07.410
Can you get free?

49:07.412 --> 49:10.049
We're working on it.
Riley?

49:31.936 --> 49:34.072
Good job, baby.

49:47.952 --> 49:49.021
- Rich.
- The phone.

49:53.191 --> 49:54.660
Oh, no.

50:05.235 --> 50:08.070
Drop it...

50:08.072 --> 50:09.275
or I'll kill him.

50:12.577 --> 50:14.744
Drop it.

50:18.615 --> 50:21.253
You're finishing
the operation!

50:30.394 --> 50:31.597
<i>Stay still.</i>

50:33.398 --> 50:35.633
Hey!

51:00.057 --> 51:04.026
- Mom?
- Yeah, Riley?

51:04.028 --> 51:05.731
Are you okay?

51:07.264 --> 51:09.798
Did he hurt you?

51:09.800 --> 51:11.235
No.

51:35.693 --> 51:38.630
Oh...

51:51.376 --> 51:53.709
Dad!

51:53.711 --> 51:55.378
Rich, where's Frank?

51:55.380 --> 51:57.479
Come on.
He went to go get help.

51:57.481 --> 51:59.314
Look, I want you
to take Riley,

51:59.316 --> 52:01.249
I want you to get out
to the back shed.

52:01.251 --> 52:03.718
Lock yourselves in.
Do not come out.

52:03.720 --> 52:06.088
Oh, I know Dad's got a gun
somewhere else on this farm.

52:06.090 --> 52:08.724
I'm gonna go find it
and draw that bastard out.

52:08.726 --> 52:11.093
- What if he...
- Hey, hey, hey.

52:11.095 --> 52:15.263
Lock yourselves in.
Do not come out no matter what.

52:15.265 --> 52:16.432
Hear me?

52:16.434 --> 52:18.767
I'm gonna come for you.

52:18.769 --> 52:20.271
I promise.

52:22.106 --> 52:24.543
All right, go, go, go.
Go, go, go now.

53:06.651 --> 53:09.651
Oh, fuck, Matty.

53:09.653 --> 53:11.887
Hey, hey, Matty.

53:11.889 --> 53:15.691
Hey. Can you please
wake up, huh?

53:15.693 --> 53:19.798
Please. I need you,
brother. I need you.

53:22.233 --> 53:25.568
- Uh, Jamie...
- Hey!

53:25.570 --> 53:26.772
Hey.

53:29.573 --> 53:32.240
Did... did it work?

53:32.242 --> 53:34.477
No?

53:34.479 --> 53:36.178
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, my...

53:37.948 --> 53:39.450
No.

53:43.887 --> 53:45.823
I counted to three.

53:47.258 --> 53:49.261
I'm so sorry.

53:51.829 --> 53:53.465
The doc, he, uh...

53:55.532 --> 53:58.236
He got the best of me.
They're-they're all gone, I...

54:00.905 --> 54:03.573
No, hey, no, no.
Don't, don't. Stop, stop.

54:03.575 --> 54:06.408
Don't. Hey, don't, don't.
Don't, don't.

54:06.410 --> 54:08.343
Hey, hey.

54:08.345 --> 54:11.479
I will make this right, okay?

54:11.481 --> 54:13.849
- Yeah? You just rest.
- Yeah.

54:13.851 --> 54:15.718
Okay, I'll take care of it.

54:15.720 --> 54:16.852
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

54:16.854 --> 54:18.486
Look at me, look at me.

54:18.488 --> 54:20.758
Going to Mexico, okay?

54:22.526 --> 54:25.494
The beach house, remember?

54:25.496 --> 54:27.296
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:27.298 --> 54:30.535
We're going no matter what.

54:31.769 --> 54:33.505
No matter what.

54:35.872 --> 54:37.441
No matter what.

54:39.376 --> 54:40.475
Jamie.

54:40.477 --> 54:42.878
Yeah, yeah, what?
Tell me.

54:42.880 --> 54:44.512
What is it?

54:44.514 --> 54:46.951
No more killing.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.793
I'm not gonna let you die.

54:57.561 --> 54:59.597
I promise you.

55:00.497 --> 55:01.963
I promise.

55:01.965 --> 55:03.935
- Okay.
- Okay?

55:05.003 --> 55:06.638
Yeah.

55:08.472 --> 55:10.508
We got this.

55:20.385 --> 55:23.222
<i>We did the best we could.</i>

55:24.521 --> 55:26.424
Rachel.

56:11.769 --> 56:14.406
Stay with me, stay with me.

56:21.611 --> 56:23.414
Okay, come over here.

57:02.686 --> 57:04.055
Oof...

57:24.575 --> 57:27.012
Okay.

57:52.736 --> 57:54.805
Oh, my God.
What were you thinking?

57:57.073 --> 57:59.041
You shot the doc?

57:59.043 --> 58:00.709
It wasn't that bad.

58:00.711 --> 58:01.943
Just clipped him
in the shoulder.

58:01.945 --> 58:03.981
Oh, Jesus Christ, Jamie.

58:06.617 --> 58:09.919
Just... just tell me
what to do, Matty.

58:09.921 --> 58:11.756
Tell me how
to make it right.

58:20.530 --> 58:23.499
Leg up. Come on.

58:23.501 --> 58:24.666
- I got it.
- No, no, no.

58:25.669 --> 58:27.035
Here, here, got it.

58:27.037 --> 58:29.972
Easy, easy.
Down right here.

58:29.974 --> 58:32.207
Right here, right here.

58:32.209 --> 58:34.542
Hey, hey.

58:34.544 --> 58:37.245
Hey.

58:37.247 --> 58:39.985
Can't... I...

58:41.686 --> 58:45.090
You cannot die.
Do you understand me?

58:47.090 --> 58:48.923
It hurts like hell, right?

58:48.925 --> 58:51.660
Right, you can do this.
Do you hear me?

58:51.662 --> 58:53.799
- Okay.
- Just tell me how to fix you.

58:55.900 --> 58:57.666
- Come on.
- Okay.

58:57.668 --> 58:58.968
What do I do?

58:58.970 --> 59:01.872
Nah, nah, nah, nah, no.
Come on, stay with me.

59:02.874 --> 59:04.106
I need to, uh...

59:04.108 --> 59:06.041
Need to get this shirt off...

59:06.043 --> 59:09.077
- You should lift the shirt off.
- Okay.

59:09.079 --> 59:11.914
Ah! Just... just stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

59:11.916 --> 59:13.948
- Jesus, stop.
- All right.

59:13.950 --> 59:15.550
Okay.

59:15.552 --> 59:18.589
Some peroxide,
a sewing kit.

59:20.191 --> 59:21.957
Talc and a mirror.

59:21.959 --> 59:24.660
- All right.
- Oh, my...

59:24.662 --> 59:26.562
- Okay. Cut the shirt off.
- All right.

59:26.564 --> 59:27.595
All right.

59:27.597 --> 59:29.733
Oh, oh.

59:30.968 --> 59:33.202
All right, all right,
be done in a minute.

59:33.204 --> 59:34.570
I'll be done in a minute.

59:34.572 --> 59:36.204
Here we go. All right.

59:36.206 --> 59:38.240
Okay. Now what?

59:38.242 --> 59:40.209
Gimme the mirror,
I need the mirror.

59:40.211 --> 59:41.609
Here.

59:41.611 --> 59:43.077
Gimme that.
All right, what?

59:43.079 --> 59:44.780
Just tell me what to do.

59:44.782 --> 59:46.582
Gimme the mirror.
Gimme the mirror.

59:46.584 --> 59:49.184
All right, and...?
Peroxide? Yes?

59:49.186 --> 59:51.220
I got an exit wound.
I gotta sew it up.

59:51.222 --> 59:53.789
Peroxide, peroxide,
peroxide, go.

59:55.892 --> 59:59.762
- All right, all right.
- Thread a needle.

59:59.764 --> 1:00:01.896
All right.
All right, what do I do?

1:00:01.898 --> 1:00:03.298
- All right, gimme the needle.
- All right, you got it?

1:00:03.300 --> 1:00:04.568
Hold the mirror.
Hold the mirror.

1:00:06.070 --> 1:00:07.202
- Okay.
- Yes?

1:00:07.204 --> 1:00:09.673
Steady, steady. Okay.

1:00:10.874 --> 1:00:13.841
All right, all right.

1:00:17.747 --> 1:00:19.851
Christ.

1:00:25.722 --> 1:00:27.923
Oh, fuck.

1:00:27.925 --> 1:00:29.227
What are you doing?

1:00:30.994 --> 1:00:33.095
Maybe just...
I could just finish or...

1:00:33.097 --> 1:00:36.097
No, Jamie.

1:00:36.099 --> 1:00:37.932
The doc, he was...

1:00:37.934 --> 1:00:40.271
He said he was almost done,
so maybe I could...

1:00:42.039 --> 1:00:44.939
There's not enough time.

1:00:44.941 --> 1:00:46.811
I can barely move.

1:00:47.378 --> 1:00:49.180
Come here.

1:00:50.314 --> 1:00:51.917
It's okay.

1:00:55.218 --> 1:00:57.155
It's all gonna be okay.

1:01:01.992 --> 1:01:04.693
Okay. Oh.

1:01:04.695 --> 1:01:05.863
Stay warm.

1:01:09.900 --> 1:01:10.968
Thanks, Pops.

1:01:21.211 --> 1:01:23.278
I always wondered
what it felt like.

1:01:26.249 --> 1:01:28.085
All right.

1:01:49.439 --> 1:01:51.073
What do you need, Matty?

1:01:51.075 --> 1:01:53.242
- Oh, right.
- Hey.

1:01:53.244 --> 1:01:55.012
Jamie...

1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:05.754
God, fuck.

1:02:05.756 --> 1:02:07.325
Jamie, Jamie.

1:02:15.932 --> 1:02:18.367
I'm gonna go find the doc.

1:02:18.369 --> 1:02:20.838
His wife, his kid.

1:02:22.338 --> 1:02:25.006
That'll make him come out of hiding.
It has to.

1:02:25.008 --> 1:02:27.945
- It's over. It's over.
- No.

1:02:29.313 --> 1:02:33.816
Listen to me. Listen.
Take the money.

1:02:33.818 --> 1:02:35.285
Take the money and leave.

1:02:36.921 --> 1:02:41.226
Take-take the car, the
money, and go to the border.

1:02:42.258 --> 1:02:44.492
Okay?

1:02:44.494 --> 1:02:46.327
You'll be safe.

1:02:46.329 --> 1:02:49.833
- What did I tell you?
- What?

1:02:52.202 --> 1:02:54.369
I'm not leaving.

1:02:54.371 --> 1:02:56.805
I'm never gonna leave you.

1:02:56.807 --> 1:02:57.840
Jamie...

1:02:57.842 --> 1:02:59.841
I'm gonna make this right.

1:02:59.843 --> 1:03:01.410
I'm gonna make this right.

1:03:01.412 --> 1:03:03.345
No, Jamie.

1:03:03.347 --> 1:03:05.146
You just hold on.
You just hold on.

1:03:05.148 --> 1:03:07.184
Oh, Jamie.

1:04:00.905 --> 1:04:04.039
Rich. Hey.

1:04:04.041 --> 1:04:05.307
Hey, man, Rich.

1:04:05.309 --> 1:04:07.144
Wake up.

1:04:14.285 --> 1:04:15.954
Doc?

1:04:18.088 --> 1:04:19.823
I know you're in there.

1:04:22.827 --> 1:04:24.262
Come on, Doc.

1:04:26.597 --> 1:04:28.229
You fuck-up.

1:04:28.231 --> 1:04:29.231
You're making this harder
than it has to be.

1:04:29.233 --> 1:04:30.566
Don't, don't.

1:04:30.568 --> 1:04:32.903
I'm not gonna fight him.

1:04:34.405 --> 1:04:36.872
You were right.

1:04:36.874 --> 1:04:38.810
I put myself first.

1:04:47.383 --> 1:04:49.952
I want you to know that I
was always proud of you.

1:04:49.954 --> 1:04:51.789
Always.

1:04:59.229 --> 1:05:01.331
Okay? So proud.

1:05:02.566 --> 1:05:04.202
So smart.

1:05:07.070 --> 1:05:09.373
So much smarter
than I ever was.

1:05:12.876 --> 1:05:15.913
Sorry I was such
a hard-ass bastard.

1:05:16.914 --> 1:05:18.283
Dad...

1:05:20.483 --> 1:05:22.386
You raise that kid right.

1:05:25.389 --> 1:05:28.523
Do a better job with her
than I did with you.

1:05:28.525 --> 1:05:30.128
Dad...

1:05:33.130 --> 1:05:34.599
What are you gonna do?

1:05:36.467 --> 1:05:38.468
I'm gonna get his attention.

1:08:39.650 --> 1:08:41.619
Thanks, Pop.

1:08:54.464 --> 1:08:55.532
Come on!

1:09:04.273 --> 1:09:06.544
Yeah, come on!

1:09:30.567 --> 1:09:32.103
Fucker, huh?

1:09:33.870 --> 1:09:35.172
Come on!

1:10:06.170 --> 1:10:07.438
Fucking get you!

1:10:21.485 --> 1:10:22.719
Ah, Christ!

1:10:39.570 --> 1:10:40.905
Come on!

1:10:43.740 --> 1:10:45.510
Fuck.

1:11:15.504 --> 1:11:16.873
Don't move.

1:11:23.379 --> 1:11:25.946
- Mom, I'm scared.
- I know.

1:11:25.948 --> 1:11:27.882
Baby, go around that corner.

1:11:27.884 --> 1:11:29.554
Okay, don't make a sound.

1:11:57.813 --> 1:11:59.584
Rich?

1:12:12.429 --> 1:12:14.828
Is that you?

1:12:14.830 --> 1:12:17.599
Jan?

1:12:17.601 --> 1:12:19.536
Jan.

1:12:21.338 --> 1:12:22.971
Riley...
Riley, she okay?

1:12:22.973 --> 1:12:25.407
- She's okay.
- She okay? Okay.

1:12:25.409 --> 1:12:26.940
I love you, Jan.
I'm sorry.

1:12:26.942 --> 1:12:29.743
- I love you.
- Oh.

1:12:29.745 --> 1:12:32.513
I swear, I'm gonna get us
out of here, okay?

1:12:32.515 --> 1:12:34.481
I will.
Oh, babe.

1:12:34.483 --> 1:12:36.685
No matter what happens,
I love you.

1:12:36.687 --> 1:12:38.787
Okay. I'm gonna
get us out of here.

1:12:38.789 --> 1:12:40.488
I'm gonna get us
out of here, okay?

1:12:40.490 --> 1:12:42.260
You got my word.

1:12:43.893 --> 1:12:45.329
Rich!

1:12:59.910 --> 1:13:01.778
<i>Rich.</i>

1:13:02.879 --> 1:13:04.945
Rich.

1:13:04.947 --> 1:13:06.616
- Wake up.
- Shit!

1:13:07.616 --> 1:13:09.918
Jan?

1:13:28.071 --> 1:13:30.137
You're finishing the surgery.

1:13:30.139 --> 1:13:31.608
Do you hear me?

1:13:35.112 --> 1:13:38.015
Jamie. Jamie.

1:13:39.415 --> 1:13:40.617
Come.

1:13:56.866 --> 1:14:01.037
Jamie. Oh, Jamie, why...
why didn't you leave?

1:14:02.539 --> 1:14:04.972
Oh, Jamie,
why didn't you leave?

1:14:04.974 --> 1:14:06.477
I told you.

1:14:09.012 --> 1:14:10.648
I'm never gonna leave you.

1:14:11.881 --> 1:14:13.750
I'm never gonna leave you.

1:14:14.851 --> 1:14:16.016
Never.

1:14:16.018 --> 1:14:19.753
- Leave.
- No. No.

1:14:19.755 --> 1:14:22.492
We're going to Mexico
together, remember?

1:14:23.692 --> 1:14:25.428
Like you said.

1:14:26.996 --> 1:14:29.864
We're getting
a house on the beach,

1:14:29.866 --> 1:14:31.733
and I'm gonna
learn to surf, too.

1:14:31.735 --> 1:14:34.135
- That was...
- Yeah, you promised.

1:14:34.137 --> 1:14:37.137
- You promised me, Matty.
- Oh, Jesus, just leave.

1:14:37.139 --> 1:14:39.873
- Leave, leave.
- No, you just don't worry.

1:14:39.875 --> 1:14:41.411
I'm-I'm gonna fix this.

1:14:43.146 --> 1:14:45.446
We should've never
come here.

1:14:45.448 --> 1:14:47.117
Should've never come.

1:14:49.753 --> 1:14:51.586
I shouldn't have
let you kill that girl.

1:14:51.588 --> 1:14:52.790
I shouldn't...

1:14:55.125 --> 1:14:58.529
Don't worry, Matty.
Don't worry.

1:15:00.062 --> 1:15:02.497
It's gonna be all right.
The doc is gonna fix you up.

1:15:02.499 --> 1:15:03.634
You'll see.

1:15:05.735 --> 1:15:07.135
Jamie.

1:15:07.137 --> 1:15:09.706
Yeah, Matty.

1:15:11.607 --> 1:15:14.476
Drag the wife out of the room.

1:15:14.478 --> 1:15:15.780
Yeah.

1:15:16.780 --> 1:15:19.049
Yeah, whatever you want.

1:15:20.717 --> 1:15:23.153
And get the doc,
so we can get this over with.

1:15:43.740 --> 1:15:45.239
- No, no, no!
- Jan!

1:15:45.241 --> 1:15:47.878
- Don't touch her! Jan!
- Rich!

1:16:08.865 --> 1:16:11.001
You got
one more operation, Doc.

1:16:15.237 --> 1:16:16.573
Come on.

1:16:25.115 --> 1:16:29.117
- What are my odds?
- Uh, honestly,

1:16:29.119 --> 1:16:33.587
if I operate without
blood transfusions,

1:16:33.589 --> 1:16:36.291
I... I don't know
what your blood pressure is,

1:16:36.293 --> 1:16:38.927
but it's not looking good.

1:16:38.929 --> 1:16:41.899
He'll live.
You understand?

1:16:42.965 --> 1:16:45.134
Let's get it over with, Doc.

1:16:47.804 --> 1:16:50.741
Ahem.

1:16:52.808 --> 1:16:54.143
Jamie...

1:17:22.871 --> 1:17:25.174
Come on, come on.

1:17:28.878 --> 1:17:31.115
Come on, come on.

1:17:34.217 --> 1:17:37.888
Hey, Matty? Matty?

1:17:42.358 --> 1:17:45.360
- Matty, Matty. Matty, Matty...
- Shit, shit, shit, shit.

1:17:51.300 --> 1:17:53.169
- Come on!
- Shh.

1:17:57.773 --> 1:17:58.909
Breathe.

1:18:00.910 --> 1:18:04.044
Breathe! Come on, man!

1:18:04.046 --> 1:18:06.247
Come on!

1:18:06.249 --> 1:18:08.916
You got this.
Get up!

1:18:08.918 --> 1:18:10.150
- Come on.
- Stand up!

1:18:10.152 --> 1:18:14.154
Do something!
Help him.

1:18:17.826 --> 1:18:19.226
Come on!

1:18:19.228 --> 1:18:22.195
- Come on!
- No! Please, God.

1:18:26.803 --> 1:18:28.035
I'm sorry.

1:18:28.037 --> 1:18:29.936
You're sorry?

1:18:29.938 --> 1:18:31.806
You're sorry?!

1:18:31.808 --> 1:18:34.074
You fucking...
You're sorry?

1:18:34.076 --> 1:18:35.677
Come on, come on,
just take it easy.

1:18:35.679 --> 1:18:37.412
Take it easy, come on.

1:18:37.414 --> 1:18:40.347
Get out of here now.

1:18:40.349 --> 1:18:42.285
But Rich.

1:18:44.019 --> 1:18:46.386
Jan, wait.

1:18:50.125 --> 1:18:52.226
Motherfucker!

1:18:52.228 --> 1:18:54.828
His chances were never
that good anyway.

1:18:54.830 --> 1:18:56.963
Take it easy.

1:18:56.965 --> 1:18:59.402
Fuck you!

1:19:04.174 --> 1:19:06.810
Fucker...

1:19:10.446 --> 1:19:12.682
Goddamn it. Fuck!

1:19:14.483 --> 1:19:16.383
- Fuck!
- Jan, run!

1:19:21.758 --> 1:19:23.157
Go!

1:20:02.098 --> 1:20:03.167
Hey!

1:21:14.870 --> 1:21:17.971
<i>Going to Mexico, okay?</i>

1:21:17.973 --> 1:21:21.007
<i>The beach house, remember?</i>

1:21:21.009 --> 1:21:22.245
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:21:23.847 --> 1:21:26.012
<i>We're going,
no matter what.</i>

1:21:26.014 --> 1:21:27.351
<i>No matter what.</i>

1:21:34.256 --> 1:21:35.558
This is for my mom.

1:22:07.589 --> 1:22:10.226
Riley!

1:22:14.530 --> 1:22:17.067
- Mom?
- Riley!

1:22:21.137 --> 1:22:22.939
Rich.

1:22:36.352 --> 1:22:38.988
Oh, Jan.

1:22:46.262 --> 1:22:48.663
Mom! Dad!

1:22:48.665 --> 1:22:50.263
Hey, baby girl.

1:22:50.265 --> 1:22:51.602
Oh.
