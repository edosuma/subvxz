03:08.856 --> 03:13.485
You were moaning last night,
saying your feet hurt.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.864
You couldn't sleep.

03:18.615 --> 03:22.619
Let me wash the gabbeh.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.873
Let me do it - I've got boots on.

03:26.123 --> 03:29.334
Pass me the boots.

03:29.585 --> 03:33.964
No, there's no need.

03:34.214 --> 03:38.844
I'll do it. You get the food ready.
I'll wash the gabbeh.

03:39.094 --> 03:42.598
Let me do it.

03:42.848 --> 03:46.602
No, you've got sore feet.

03:46.852 --> 03:50.230
Give me the boots.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.233
No, I won't give them to you.

03:55.611 --> 03:59.865
You see to the food.
I'll see to the gabbeh.

04:00.115 --> 04:03.869
I'm not a woman
who serves in the kitchen!

04:25.849 --> 04:28.977
Will you let me wash it
or won't you?

04:32.105 --> 04:36.360
Little darling, precious darling,

04:37.236 --> 04:41.240
if you don't wash it, who will?

04:43.367 --> 04:47.496
My precious gabbeh,
beautiful gabbeh,

04:48.247 --> 04:50.707
how pretty you are!

04:51.208 --> 04:54.711
Why have you turned blue?

04:55.212 --> 04:58.966
Who is this horseman
who is carrying off this girl?

04:59.216 --> 05:02.344
Tell me who wove you.

05:05.848 --> 05:09.977
You are like the full moon!

05:27.744 --> 05:30.122
What is your name?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.207
Gabbeh.

05:41.592 --> 05:43.969
The water is so clear.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.849
Won't you wash me?

05:49.224 --> 05:53.353
Of course we want to wash you.

06:16.585 --> 06:20.714
May I lean on your young shoulders?

06:21.590 --> 06:24.968
I have no more strength.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.350
Of course you can.

06:39.107 --> 06:43.487
You look familiar.
What's your father's name?

06:43.987 --> 06:46.490
His name is Weave...

06:47.741 --> 06:50.744
Weave of the wool. There he is.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.977
There's Father.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.732
We never stay
in the same place long.

07:20.983 --> 07:25.737
But if we do,
our father forces us to leave.

07:26.113 --> 07:29.867
One day, I fell in love
with a horseman.

07:30.117 --> 07:34.705
He had a strange voice,
as if he were but an illusion.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.584
He followed our tribe
like a shadow to take me away...

07:42.337 --> 07:47.968
Were I younger,
I would ask for your hand.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.721
I think your father

07:51.096 --> 07:52.472
is a kind man.

07:52.723 --> 07:57.227
Appearances can be deceptive.
He has a wicked temper.

07:57.728 --> 08:01.356
So much for your father.
What about your mother?

08:01.607 --> 08:04.234
Is she kind and fair?

08:05.235 --> 08:09.364
No, in our family, we say
my father's bad temper

08:09.615 --> 08:12.367
is due to my mother's ugliness.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.244
There she is.

08:14.745 --> 08:18.457
My mother's name is Sakineh.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.960
I am the eldest daughter.

08:28.091 --> 08:32.221
Pass me the boots
so I can wash the gabbeh.

08:32.471 --> 08:36.350
Your feet are sore. They'll feel
worse if you get them wet.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.352
I'll wash it.

08:40.979 --> 08:45.359
See how beautiful she is.

08:45.609 --> 08:48.487
I am filled with wonder.

08:50.989 --> 08:54.493
As soon as he sees you,
he forgets me.

08:55.744 --> 09:02.209
Miss Gabbeh,
she is jealous of herself.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.971
Little girl, you who are so fair,

09:14.221 --> 09:16.348
do you not have a suitor?

09:16.723 --> 09:19.351
You were my suitor

09:19.726 --> 09:22.479
when you were younger.

09:26.108 --> 09:30.612
How foolish I was!

09:36.118 --> 09:39.705
See how he breaks my heart!

09:47.212 --> 09:49.590
Do you not have a suitor?

10:07.232 --> 10:10.861
Why does his voice
sound like a wolf's?

10:12.613 --> 10:15.365
It's a secret between him and me.

10:15.866 --> 10:19.828
He says: "I can't bear it.
Why don't you come?"

10:31.965 --> 10:34.218
Do you love him?

10:34.718 --> 10:37.846
Why don't you run away with him?

10:39.223 --> 10:42.726
Because of my father. He'd kill me.

10:43.352 --> 10:48.482
If he had done so, I would be free.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.579
He calls. Should I go?

11:03.330 --> 11:06.959
Don't go or your father
will kill you.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.087
Talk to him about it first.

11:10.462 --> 11:12.464
Grandma's ill.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.843
When Uncle returns
he'll take her to a doctor.

11:16.093 --> 11:22.224
Father said I could only marry
when my uncle comes back from town.

11:22.724 --> 11:27.229
But my suitor is becoming impatient.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.711
- Once five?
- Five.

11:50.961 --> 11:53.463
- Two fives?
- Ten.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.966
- Three fives?
- Fifteen.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.719
- Four fives?
- Twenty.

11:58.969 --> 12:01.471
- Five fives?
- Twenty-five.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.974
Remain seated.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.351
Stand up.

12:07.978 --> 12:11.231
May I?

12:13.859 --> 12:16.486
- What is your name?
- Mohsen Jahanpour.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.614
- And you?
- Tahmineh.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.491
What kind of school is this?

12:22.117 --> 12:24.828
- An itinerant one.
- Where's Fars?

12:25.204 --> 12:26.580
In Iran.

12:49.353 --> 12:53.106
Well, well,
a class without a teacher...

12:53.357 --> 12:55.734
Let's make the most of it.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.844
Now repeat after me:

13:22.094 --> 13:25.848
"R.A.N.G."

13:26.098 --> 13:27.850
What does that mean?

13:28.100 --> 13:29.726
Color.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.603
Bravo.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.231
Now tell me

13:35.482 --> 13:37.609
what color that is.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.736
Red.

13:43.115 --> 13:45.742
The red of a poppy.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.581
Now tell me what color that is.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.709
Yellow.

13:55.961 --> 14:00.465
The yellow of a wheat field.

14:00.966 --> 14:03.218
And that?

14:04.720 --> 14:06.847
Blue.

14:08.849 --> 14:14.104
The blue of God's heaven.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.232
And that?

14:19.234 --> 14:21.236
Blue.

14:25.240 --> 14:29.953
The shimmering blue of the seas.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.081
And that?

14:35.959 --> 14:37.711
Yellow.

14:40.714 --> 14:44.968
The yellow of the sun
which lights up the world.

14:45.844 --> 14:48.222
The yellow of the sun

14:48.472 --> 14:51.725
and the blue of the water
make the green of plants.

14:53.477 --> 14:55.229
Green.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.857
Pure green.

15:01.109 --> 15:06.240
Yellow and red
together in the sun...

16:46.965 --> 16:50.594
Spring came,
but my uncle still did not come.

16:50.844 --> 16:54.973
In the spring, the whole tribe
broke camp, except for our clan.

16:55.349 --> 16:59.102
My father was waiting
for my uncle to return

16:59.353 --> 17:02.231
and take Grandma into town.

17:02.481 --> 17:06.734
She was ill,
but did not want to die.

17:06.984 --> 17:10.113
She wanted to see Uncle first,

17:10.364 --> 17:14.326
but he came too late.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.453
Father

17:16.828 --> 17:22.584
buried Grandma
in a lush cemetery.

17:32.094 --> 17:34.221
Hey there!

18:01.331 --> 18:04.710
- Hello, Sakineh. How are you?
- Hello, sir.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.212
Don't you recognize me?

18:09.715 --> 18:12.092
- No.
- You don't recognize me?

18:13.969 --> 18:15.470
And now?

18:17.347 --> 18:19.850
You are my husband's brother.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.102
Good.

18:22.352 --> 18:25.230
Why didn't you come with your wife?

18:25.981 --> 18:28.734
I am still young.
Who would marry me?

18:29.234 --> 18:31.987
Hello, Zinat. How are you?

18:32.237 --> 18:36.450
You recognized me
without my hat on!

18:38.327 --> 18:42.456
Miss Gabbeh, your uncle is here.

18:42.706 --> 18:45.459
The wedding day is nearing.

18:45.709 --> 18:48.086
How are you, Sakineh?

18:48.462 --> 18:51.715
And the children?
How many do you have?

18:51.965 --> 18:54.968
Seven. Come on, children.
Your uncle's here.

18:55.469 --> 18:58.472
Zinat, are you well?

19:01.225 --> 19:03.727
- Hello.
- Hello, Uncle.

19:09.358 --> 19:12.486
How you've grown!

19:14.863 --> 19:20.702
Tell your uncle
to put in a good word for you.

19:21.578 --> 19:25.207
My uncle?
He doesn't even remember me.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.838
He doesn't even know
if he's my uncle

19:31.088 --> 19:34.091
on my mother's or my father's side!

19:37.970 --> 19:39.721
Is this your child?

19:40.097 --> 19:43.725
You have been away so long
you no longer recognize them.

19:44.101 --> 19:47.604
You mock me. I shall show you.

19:49.106 --> 19:51.608
Zinat, go over there.

19:51.859 --> 19:54.111
Sakineh, go the other side.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.864
Soraya, go to your mother.

20:00.576 --> 20:03.328
Fatomeh, go over there.

20:04.079 --> 20:08.584
Reza, you go there too.
Go with Zinat.

20:09.835 --> 20:12.588
You look like my brother.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.718
- So did I get it right?
- No!

20:18.218 --> 20:20.721
Well, where did I go wrong?

20:23.599 --> 20:26.977
Our uncle brought us together
under the tree.

20:27.227 --> 20:30.856
This tree is the symbol
of our family.

20:31.231 --> 20:37.487
A new branch sprouts
with each new birth.

20:38.113 --> 20:41.825
When one of us dies,

20:42.201 --> 20:46.205
a branch is cut off.

20:46.580 --> 20:50.709
Grandmother recognized each child

20:50.959 --> 20:54.087
by the branches of the tree.

20:58.967 --> 21:03.096
See? Uncle didn't ask after me.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.850
He didn't ask where Gabbeh was.

21:08.227 --> 21:10.854
He only came back for his mother.

21:11.104 --> 21:14.483
Where's my mother? Where's Narendj?

21:16.735 --> 21:18.362
Mother!

21:20.322 --> 21:22.950
Mother! Narendj!

21:23.951 --> 21:27.579
Your Abbas is back.

21:27.955 --> 21:30.207
Where are you, Mom?

21:42.469 --> 21:45.597
Too late.
Your guardian angel has passed away.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.979
Too late.
Your guardian angel has passed away.

22:00.988 --> 22:04.324
She wanted to finish this gabbeh
for your wedding

22:04.825 --> 22:07.202
and send it to you in town.

24:47.946 --> 24:50.449
It is time for the wedding.

24:51.200 --> 24:55.204
Alas, not mine. My uncle's.

24:59.208 --> 25:04.463
My father said:
"Your uncle still isn't married.

25:05.214 --> 25:09.218
"It's his turn first,
then it'll be yours."

25:19.478 --> 25:21.730
Congratulations.

25:22.105 --> 25:24.733
Uncle, please get married.

25:27.236 --> 25:31.949
The yellow of the wheat field.

25:41.208 --> 25:44.086
Children, what is that sound?

25:45.212 --> 25:47.214
A sparrow.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.473
And what can you hear over there?

25:56.849 --> 25:58.350
A sparrow.

25:58.600 --> 26:03.355
Old man, let it fly away.
So my uncle gets married quickly.

26:17.703 --> 26:19.329
The sparrow?

26:19.580 --> 26:21.456
The singing bird.

26:21.707 --> 26:24.209
The singing bird.

26:24.459 --> 26:27.212
Thanks to the yellow,

26:30.465 --> 26:34.720
the sparrow has become a canary.

28:36.842 --> 28:39.094
Anyone there?

28:39.469 --> 28:44.850
My uncle dreamed he would meet
his wife near a spring.

28:45.225 --> 28:48.604
A girl who could sing
like a canary.

28:48.854 --> 28:52.608
My father looked for a wife
for my uncle

28:52.858 --> 28:55.194
in each and every clan.

28:55.569 --> 28:57.946
The girls were all pretty,

28:58.197 --> 29:02.075
but none sang like a canary.

29:02.326 --> 29:06.830
Uncle said he would find
his wife near a spring.

29:08.332 --> 29:11.460
My uncle saw this spring
in a dream.

29:11.710 --> 29:14.838
Our tribe stopped at every spring.

29:15.088 --> 29:17.341
But we never met a girl

29:17.716 --> 29:19.593
who sang like a canary.

29:20.594 --> 29:21.845
Where is the spring?

29:24.223 --> 29:26.975
Where you hear the sound of water.

30:19.820 --> 30:21.446
Hello.

30:21.697 --> 30:23.448
Hello.

30:25.826 --> 30:28.203
What is your name?

30:29.580 --> 30:32.207
I am the daughter of Aladad.

30:44.344 --> 30:46.722
I was looking for water,

30:47.222 --> 30:51.977
but I found singing.
What a beautiful poem.

30:52.227 --> 30:56.106
- I'd never heard it before.
- I wrote it last night.

30:56.481 --> 31:00.944
- You're the first to hear it.
- When? Last night?

31:01.195 --> 31:03.447
That's right.

31:03.697 --> 31:05.949
- So you wrote it?
- Of course.

31:06.200 --> 31:09.703
Let me help with the dishes.

31:10.704 --> 31:12.831
Are you a poet?

31:13.081 --> 31:15.959
No, I'm Aladad's daughter.

31:16.210 --> 31:19.463
I'd never heard this poem before.
Tell me it again.

31:23.467 --> 31:26.220
(Turkish dialect)

31:30.724 --> 31:33.602
Bravo. But tell me it in Persian.

31:35.229 --> 31:39.233
Above the spring I stand
Below the spring I stand

31:39.483 --> 31:42.819
The pebble in the spring I am

31:43.195 --> 31:45.948
When my beloved passes by...

31:47.950 --> 31:52.704
The canary he holds I am
I am in three parts...

31:53.455 --> 31:55.332
Did you write it?

31:55.582 --> 31:57.084
Yes.

31:58.085 --> 31:59.586
Bravo.

31:59.962 --> 32:03.715
Who did you write it for?
For your beloved?

32:03.966 --> 32:07.469
No, for myself.
I have no beloved.

32:09.471 --> 32:12.349
Aren't you married?

32:13.475 --> 32:15.227
No.

32:17.354 --> 32:19.982
And why's that?

32:21.441 --> 32:22.943
Well...

32:26.321 --> 32:29.074
Time flies by.
How old are you?

32:43.463 --> 32:46.466
- Have you come from town?
- Yes.

32:50.721 --> 32:53.724
If you had a suitor,
would you get married?

32:58.979 --> 33:03.817
I'll have to wait and see
what fate has in store for me.

33:06.069 --> 33:08.071
Supposing I...

33:16.705 --> 33:19.458
How bold he is!

33:24.087 --> 33:29.843
At his age...
There's no fool like an old fool!

33:33.222 --> 33:35.098
She's stolen his heart.

33:37.100 --> 33:40.479
Quiet.
Let them get married quickly.

33:43.232 --> 33:47.319
If you get angry at me,
what will you do?

33:47.569 --> 33:49.321
Huddle up

33:49.696 --> 33:52.199
and recite poems.

33:57.204 --> 33:58.705
Like what?

33:59.456 --> 34:02.960
I am thirsty, you are pure water

34:03.961 --> 34:06.213
I am thirsty, you are pure water

34:09.341 --> 34:13.094
I am weary, you are energy

34:13.846 --> 34:18.350
I am tired and old and withered

34:19.351 --> 34:22.855
You are youth, you are a bud

34:23.105 --> 34:27.818
I am thirsty, you are pure water

34:31.071 --> 34:36.952
I am weary, you are energy...

34:39.705 --> 34:41.331
Yes...

34:43.208 --> 34:45.335
Yes...

34:46.712 --> 34:47.713
Yes.

34:48.088 --> 34:50.465
What does that mean?

34:53.217 --> 34:57.598
I liked your poem.
I'll marry you.

35:01.977 --> 35:05.105
Where were you?
The child is thirsty.

35:09.443 --> 35:12.321
I'm sorry. Fill this up.

35:12.571 --> 35:15.824
I shall help this young lady.

35:41.225 --> 35:43.477
Be patient.

35:43.727 --> 35:47.105
Just while the water skin's
being filled

35:47.314 --> 35:49.942
It's taking for ever.

35:50.192 --> 35:53.070
No, you're not patient enough.

36:05.582 --> 36:10.712
I was in love once - I understand
your suffering. Let me help.

36:52.337 --> 36:56.592
I asked for the hand
of Aladad's daughter.

36:56.842 --> 36:59.970
And here's some sugar to celebrate.

40:59.334 --> 41:01.587
I must gather the wool

41:01.837 --> 41:05.090
or else my uncle's wedding
will be delayed.

41:33.702 --> 41:36.580
Aladad's daughter,
did you weave this gabbeh?

41:36.830 --> 41:40.459
Of course.
Who else could have done it?

41:43.462 --> 41:45.839
Why is there this horseman?

41:46.089 --> 41:48.342
The bride is taken away
by a horseman.

41:48.592 --> 41:53.096
Yes, but not
if the bridegroom is old.

41:53.597 --> 41:55.849
That's fine for young couples.

41:58.602 --> 42:02.439
I hear the call of old age

42:02.689 --> 42:05.817
when I see my hair is grey...

42:06.318 --> 42:10.822
Come to the wedding celebrations.
Everyone's tired of waiting.

42:11.073 --> 42:15.577
I'm coming. Don't do anything
to make me regret this wedding.

42:18.830 --> 42:21.708
Looking is not seeing

42:21.959 --> 42:25.712
Behind every cradle
hides a tomb

42:25.963 --> 42:28.966
Behind every joy, sadness...

42:29.341 --> 42:32.469
Why did you recite a poem?
Are you angry with me?

42:32.719 --> 42:33.846
No.

42:34.096 --> 42:37.224
I am happy and contented.

42:38.475 --> 42:43.564
But...
Fifty-seven years have gone by

42:43.814 --> 42:47.317
Alas! Gone by so quickly...

42:52.698 --> 42:54.449
Do not be sad.

42:54.825 --> 42:58.203
Although my body grows old

42:58.453 --> 43:02.332
and my hair is turning grey,
my heart is full of desire

43:03.333 --> 43:05.085
and hope

43:05.335 --> 43:09.590
My body is like a cold,
silent dungeon

43:10.841 --> 43:14.219
But my heart
is like a happy child...

45:12.337 --> 45:15.841
My uncle's wedding
is woven into the gabbeh.

45:16.216 --> 45:20.846
Our clan left
my uncle and his wife

45:21.096 --> 45:25.225
by the river bank
to have their honeymoon.

46:43.345 --> 46:47.850
Why are you crying, Miss Gabbeh?

46:48.559 --> 46:51.311
Because I still have to wait.

46:53.689 --> 46:56.441
Father said
Mother must first give birth.

46:56.692 --> 46:58.819
After that, I can get married.

47:00.571 --> 47:06.952
But your father said you could
after your uncle's wedding!

47:10.080 --> 47:12.958
Now he says
after Mother's given birth.

47:13.584 --> 47:17.212
When is she due to give birth?

47:20.841 --> 47:23.468
When we've broken camp,

47:24.469 --> 47:28.974
when we've walked a while,
when we've worked a while,

47:29.933 --> 47:32.936
when we've crossed the river...

48:33.455 --> 48:39.086
The women blew into the water skins
to inflate them.

48:40.087 --> 48:43.340
The men tied them to the rafts

48:43.590 --> 48:48.095
and the boys put
the animals on the rafts

48:48.720 --> 48:51.849
so the water
would not wash them away.

48:52.057 --> 48:53.934
We had a flock of ewes.

48:54.309 --> 48:57.813
My mother worked
harder than the others,

48:58.063 --> 49:01.191
but there was still
no sign of the birth.

49:34.057 --> 49:35.434
We crossed

49:35.809 --> 49:40.314
a freshwater river
and two saltwater rivers...

49:40.564 --> 49:44.067
but still my mother
did not give birth.

50:25.442 --> 50:27.444
Uncle!

50:30.322 --> 50:32.699
The hen's laid an egg!

50:42.209 --> 50:44.211
It's time.

50:45.838 --> 50:47.840
It's time!

50:49.842 --> 50:52.094
Uncle, stop everything.

50:52.344 --> 50:55.097
Stop, I say!

52:05.584 --> 52:07.336
I am a stranger.

52:07.711 --> 52:12.466
Why's that man stopping?
He should go away.

52:17.221 --> 52:20.057
Life is color!

52:41.328 --> 52:44.206
Love is color!

52:44.456 --> 52:47.334
Man is color!

52:50.337 --> 52:52.589
Woman is color!

52:53.340 --> 52:55.717
Love is color!

53:06.812 --> 53:08.438
Child is color!

53:10.440 --> 53:12.818
Love is pain!

53:45.934 --> 53:50.939
You never gave me a child.

53:51.190 --> 53:54.693
I'd like to have a child.

53:56.695 --> 53:59.823
How beautiful!

54:04.578 --> 54:06.455
I'm leaving for good.

54:08.332 --> 54:12.711
I don't give a damn!

54:18.342 --> 54:20.719
The old woman has left.

54:20.969 --> 54:24.681
Do you want to run away with me?

54:24.932 --> 54:26.558
Father would kill us.

54:26.808 --> 54:29.061
You're lying.

54:29.311 --> 54:33.440
God doesn't forgive liars.

54:33.690 --> 54:37.194
Tell me the truth.

54:38.195 --> 54:41.823
Don't lie.

54:44.451 --> 54:48.205
You don't love me. You're lying.

54:48.705 --> 54:51.583
I'm not lying. I love you.

54:52.334 --> 54:55.838
It's not true.

54:56.213 --> 54:59.341
I know you're lying.

55:00.467 --> 55:03.345
Here's a baby. Stop complaining!

55:03.929 --> 55:07.057
I'm sure you're lying.

55:07.307 --> 55:10.686
Your father won't see.

55:21.321 --> 55:25.576
What a beautiful baby he is.

55:26.451 --> 55:29.955
Has he drunk some milk?

55:30.831 --> 55:32.207
No.

55:32.833 --> 55:34.835
He hasn't?

55:35.335 --> 55:38.714
Go get some milk.

55:53.812 --> 55:56.315
Go and milk his mother.

55:58.066 --> 56:00.319
He's hungry.

56:06.074 --> 56:09.453
Give him his mother's milk.

56:21.590 --> 56:23.717
Sakineh, the baby's hungry.

57:36.456 --> 57:39.960
Life is color!

57:42.212 --> 57:44.339
Death is...

58:53.700 --> 58:56.328
You told me to wash the gabbeh

58:56.578 --> 59:00.707
to feel better.
So why are you crying?

59:01.458 --> 59:04.086
Because I still must wait.

59:05.087 --> 59:08.590
My father and my uncle aren't here.

59:09.716 --> 59:11.802
Nor is my mother.

59:12.177 --> 59:16.306
They have taken my sister-in-law
to see a doctor in town.

59:17.808 --> 59:21.311
I am to look after
the children and the animals.

59:23.689 --> 59:26.817
One of the sheep has a chill.

59:27.693 --> 59:30.445
My sister Sholeh has disappeared.

01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:14.698
Don't run off.

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:50.317
Mind, you'll fall!

01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:09.962
Mom! Uncle! I'm going to fall...

01:01:19.805 --> 01:01:21.807
Uncle!

01:01:34.444 --> 01:01:35.571
Dad!

01:01:36.446 --> 01:01:38.198
Sholeh!

01:02:46.683 --> 01:02:48.810
It's my fault.

01:06:47.424 --> 01:06:50.928
Why did you stop? Go on!

01:08:13.552 --> 01:08:17.055
Why did you stop? Go on, move!

01:10:00.450 --> 01:10:03.954
Go the other way.

01:14:24.673 --> 01:14:29.428
By day, the girls kept watch
over me, by night, the men did.

01:14:29.803 --> 01:14:33.432
I had no chance to run away.

01:14:33.682 --> 01:14:36.935
The day Grandmother's gabbeh
was finished,

01:14:37.686 --> 01:14:43.317
my uncle told me I should run away.

01:14:44.193 --> 01:14:47.070
He said he'd take
my father on one side

01:14:47.446 --> 01:14:49.948
so he wouldn't see me leave.

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:55.704
O mother, your gabbeh is finished.

01:14:58.332 --> 01:15:01.919
I'd like to sleep on it
and never get up again.

01:15:02.294 --> 01:15:07.049
That's when I had a chance
of escape, but I didn't dare.

01:15:07.549 --> 01:15:12.429
Why won't you come?
Tell me why!

01:15:15.933 --> 01:15:20.187
Why do you hurt me?

01:15:20.437 --> 01:15:23.315
Why don't we run away together?

01:15:23.565 --> 01:15:29.071
Come on. Don't make me suffer.

01:15:29.947 --> 01:15:35.702
Your father isn't here.

01:15:40.082 --> 01:15:43.293
You've made me so unhappy.

01:15:43.544 --> 01:15:46.922
You've made me lose my mind.

01:15:47.923 --> 01:15:52.302
Why won't you listen to me?

01:15:53.303 --> 01:15:56.682
Stop making me angry!

01:16:28.922 --> 01:16:31.675
Because of you,

01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:35.929
I am like a suffering soul.

01:16:36.805 --> 01:16:39.933
Why won't you listen to me?

01:16:40.184 --> 01:16:42.186
Do you not love me?

01:16:42.436 --> 01:16:46.064
You do not love me!

01:16:59.453 --> 01:17:03.832
You do not love me.

01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:06.668
I brought you some apples.

01:17:06.919 --> 01:17:09.671
Why don't you eat them?

01:17:14.927 --> 01:17:17.429
You don't love me.

01:22:12.683 --> 01:22:14.560
He killed them!

01:22:16.562 --> 01:22:18.564
He killed them!

01:23:45.442 --> 01:23:47.945
Miss Gabbeh,

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:52.324
will you help me
wash the gabbeh tomorrow?

01:23:52.574 --> 01:23:56.328
I can't do it. My feet hurt.

01:24:06.046 --> 01:24:08.674
Miss Gabbeh,

01:24:09.424 --> 01:24:14.304
do what you want with me,
but don't break my heart.

01:24:24.439 --> 01:24:28.694
The old woman has left. Don't lie.

01:24:29.069 --> 01:24:33.949
Let's leave together.
How many times must I beg you?

01:24:34.324 --> 01:24:37.452
You don't love me.

01:24:43.041 --> 01:24:45.794
You're a liar...

01:24:49.173 --> 01:24:54.052
You don't love me.
Tell me the truth.

01:24:54.303 --> 01:24:57.306
My father didn't really kill us.

01:24:57.806 --> 01:25:01.310
It was only a rumor.
He just said it

01:25:01.935 --> 01:25:05.314
so that my sisters wouldn't run away

01:25:05.564 --> 01:25:09.193
and so that they never answered
the wolf's call.

01:25:09.443 --> 01:25:12.946
That is why, for forty years now,

01:25:13.447 --> 01:25:19.077
no one has heard
the canary's song near a spring.
