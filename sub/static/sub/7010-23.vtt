00:01.376 --> 00:06.338
[MUSIC]

00:09.300 --> 00:11.510
HEY, MOM, ARE YOU
GONNA WEAR THAT TO CHURCH,

00:11.678 --> 00:14.096
OR IS IT JUST LAUNDRY DAY?
HA HA HA HA.

00:14.264 --> 00:17.349
THINK ABOUT IT.

00:20.478 --> 00:23.105
NO. THERE'S AN EMERGENCY
AT THE HOSPITAL,

00:23.273 --> 00:24.732
AND THEY'RE REALLY
SHORT-STAFFED.

00:24.899 --> 00:28.152
I'M SORRY I'M NOT GONNA
MAKE IT TO CHURCH TODAY.

00:28.319 --> 00:29.737
ALL RIGHT!
NO CHURCH!

00:29.904 --> 00:31.697
HEY, WE CAN WATCH
THE BREWERS GAME.

00:32.407 --> 00:33.657
SOUNDS GREAT!

00:33.825 --> 00:35.451
LAURIE WILL COOK US UP
A COUPLE OF HOT DOGS...

00:35.618 --> 00:38.829
NO. NO BREWERS, NO HOT
DOGS, NO NICE DAY.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.707
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE SURE
THESE KIDS GET TO CHURCH.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.876
WHY DO WE HAVE TO GO?

00:44.044 --> 00:45.961
WELL, I HAVE A MILLION
REASONS AND NO TIME.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.714
NOW, HERE'S A DOLLAR
FOR THE OFFERING.

00:50.216 --> 00:55.596
AND YOU REMEMBER... YOU
SING LOUD, YOU SING PROUD.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.975
HEY, HOW ABOUT YOU? HOW
COME YOU NEVER HAVE TO GO?

01:01.603 --> 01:04.313
ERIC...

01:04.981 --> 01:08.442
GOD AND I HAD
A HEART TO HEART...

01:08.610 --> 01:13.363
WHILE I WATCHED MY DESTROYER
GO DOWN IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC.

01:13.531 --> 01:16.033
WE'RE REAL GOOD.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.536
YOU'RE NOT.

01:20.371 --> 01:21.789
Red: GO.

01:21.956 --> 01:24.458
OKAY.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.961
WELL, I'LL SEE YA.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.964
I'M GONNA GO MEET SOME FRIENDS
BEHIND THE BOWLING ALLEY.

01:31.883 --> 01:34.343
LAURIE, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO GO TO CHURCH.

01:34.511 --> 01:39.056
[MIMICS] OH, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO GO TO CHURCH.

01:39.224 --> 01:42.810
STOP BEING SUCH A LITTLE GIRL
AND DO SOMETHING BAD FOR ONCE.

HELLO, WISCONSIN!

02:20.640 --> 02:22.891
SO, ERIC, I SEE YOU'RE
NOT IN CHURCH TODAY.

02:23.059 --> 02:26.186
UH, NO. NOW THAT I'M NOT
A VIRGIN ANYMORE,

02:26.354 --> 02:29.648
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING LEFT
TO PRAY FOR.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.279
MAN, MY LIFE SUCKS.

02:35.446 --> 02:37.906
EVER SINCE JACKIE LEFT,
I'M NO GOOD AT PINBALL.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.701
YOU WERE NEVER GOOD
AT PINBALL.

02:40.869 --> 02:44.413
LET'S LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE
OF NOT HAVING JACKIE.

02:44.581 --> 02:48.625
FIRST, NO JACKIE.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.044
SECOND, NOW YOU CAN DO
ALL THE THINGS

02:51.212 --> 02:53.463
THAT YOU COULD NEVER DO
WHEN YOU WERE WITH HER, MAN...

02:53.631 --> 02:55.424
WHICH WAS AT LAST COUNT...

02:55.592 --> 02:58.802
EVERYTHING.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.388
OH, MAN...
YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.223
YOU KNOW, JACKIE NEVER
EVER WANTED ME TO, LIKE,

03:03.391 --> 03:07.352
CHEAT ON HER,
OR GROW A BEARD,

03:07.520 --> 03:08.896
AND I ALWAYS
WANTED TO.

03:09.063 --> 03:12.399
AND NOW I CAN
LET THIS GROW OUT!

03:12.567 --> 03:14.776
MAY I GROW ONE, TOO?

03:14.944 --> 03:17.988
I DON'T KNOW, FEZ. THE TWO OF
US GROWING BEARDS TOGETHER...

03:18.156 --> 03:23.160
ISN'T THAT KIND
OF GIRLIE?

03:23.328 --> 03:27.414
HMM, WELL, I JUST FIGURE
THE MORE THE HAIRIER.

03:32.170 --> 03:35.631
OH, I'M SURROUNDED
BY IDIOTS.

03:39.969 --> 03:43.889
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT MAKE
OUR CHURCH PLOY WORK BETTER?

03:44.057 --> 03:48.060
IF YOU'D BUTTON
YOUR SHIRT.

03:51.522 --> 03:54.775
OH, AND, UH... HEY, WHAT'S
THAT IN YOUR HAIR?

03:54.943 --> 03:57.736
OH, A CIGARETTE BUTT.
THAT'S NICE.

03:58.529 --> 04:02.324
UGH. THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I MAKE OUT ON ASPHALT.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.452
AH... THERE THEY ARE.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.037
MY LITTLE ANGELS
ARE HOME.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.081
HOW WAS CHURCH,
GOOD SERMON?

04:09.249 --> 04:10.707
YOU KNOW, FINE.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.627
JESUS SAID SOMETHING
REALLY WISE.

04:13.795 --> 04:17.172
PEOPLE SAID,
OH, THAT JESUS.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.633
AND NOW WE GO AND TRY AND
LIVE OUR LIVES THAT WAY.

04:19.801 --> 04:23.929
YOU MEAN, LIKE A COUPLE OF,
UH, BIG, FAT LIARS?

04:25.306 --> 04:27.891
YEAH. I RAN INTO BOB
OUT IN THE DRIVEWAY,

04:28.059 --> 04:30.185
AND HE TOLD ME YOU
WEREN'T AT CHURCH.

04:30.353 --> 04:34.648
GOD! I HATE BOB!

04:34.816 --> 04:38.402
I TRIED TO GO, DADDY, BUT ERIC
WOULDN'T GIVE ME A RIDE.

04:40.613 --> 04:44.533
HEY, MARY MAGDALENE, THERE'S
SOME GUM ON YOUR NECK.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.080
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT MY OWN
CHILDREN WOULD DO THIS.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.165
MOM, I MEAN, IT'S
SUCH A NICE DAY.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.751
AND WE WANTED TO GET
SOME OF THAT FRESH AIR

04:54.919 --> 04:56.503
YOU'RE ALWAYS
TELLING US ABOUT.

04:56.671 --> 05:00.590
HEY. NOBODY LIKES
A SMART-MOUTH SINNER.

05:01.175 --> 05:02.342
YOU KNOW, THIS
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED

05:02.510 --> 05:05.012
IF SOMEONE HAD MADE SURE HIS
CHILDREN HAD GOTTEN TO CHURCH.

05:05.179 --> 05:07.556
WELL, I...

05:08.349 --> 05:10.976
DAMN!

05:11.144 --> 05:13.103
ALL RIGHT, FROM NOW ON,
YOU KIDS ARE GOING TO CHURCH.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.771
THAT'S AN ORDER.

05:14.939 --> 05:15.897
OH, DAD...

05:16.065 --> 05:17.107
OKAY, OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.358
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO FORCE THEM.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.526
THEY'RE ALMOST GROWN UP.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.862
THEY CAN MAKE UP
THEIR OWN MINDS.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.530
REALLY?

05:23.698 --> 05:26.199
SURE.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.868
IF YOU WANT TO TURN
YOUR BACKS ON GOD

05:28.036 --> 05:31.038
AND SPEND ETERNITY DOING
LAPS IN A LAKE OF FIRE,

05:31.205 --> 05:33.874
WELL, THAT'S YOUR CHOICE!

05:39.297 --> 05:41.631
SO... GUYS...

05:41.799 --> 05:44.885
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE BEARD?!

05:45.053 --> 05:48.263
YES, IT'S NOT BAD
AFTER ONE WEEK, HUH?

05:48.431 --> 05:50.140
I THINK
IT'S STUPID.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.934
YOU LOOK
LIKE A HOBO.

05:53.102 --> 05:54.644
WELL, YOU'RE CRAZY.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.521
WELL, YOU LOOK
LIKE A HOBO.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.775
CRAZY!
HOBO!

05:59.942 --> 06:02.694
YEAH, WELL, I LIKE IT.
I THINK IT LOOKS RUGGED.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.572
LOOK HOW THICK
IT'S COMING IN.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.166
HELLO.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.959
WELL, FEZ, THAT'S
A NICE BEARD.

06:18.127 --> 06:22.047
IT WILL BE, ONCE IT
REALLY COMES IN.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.508
DOESN'T MICHAEL'S
LOOK STUPID?

06:24.675 --> 06:26.259
I MEAN, IT'S NOT EVEN
GROWING IN RIGHT.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.387
IT'S ALL PATCHY.

06:28.554 --> 06:32.057
HA HA.
POOR PATCHY.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.351
ALL RIGHT, I DON'T
HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

06:34.519 --> 06:38.021
AW, NOW WE MADE
PATCHY UPSET.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.358
BYE, PATCHY.
SO LONG, PATCHY.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.613
I MISS PATCHY.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.990
GOD, DOESN'T MICHAEL LOOK
HOT WITH THAT BEARD?

06:49.158 --> 06:51.910
I MEAN, IT'S ALL
ROUGH AND FORBIDDEN.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.038
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
KELSO LOOKED STUPID.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.207
WELL, I CAN'T
TELL HIM I LIKE IT.

06:57.375 --> 07:00.168
I HATE HIS GUTS!

07:00.336 --> 07:02.921
BUT I HATE HIM EVEN MORE
NOW THAT HE'S SO HOT.

07:03.089 --> 07:06.800
THAT HOT BEARDED JERK.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.386
WHAT ABOUT
MY BEARD?

07:09.554 --> 07:12.514
IT HAS EGG IN IT.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.393
LAURIE, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

07:16.561 --> 07:17.936
CHURCH STARTS
IN 10 MINUTES.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.063
MOM, I'M NOT GOING!

07:20.231 --> 07:23.316
WHAT?

07:23.484 --> 07:25.610
WELL... ERIC'S
NOT GOING EITHER.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.821
OH, OF COURSE HE IS.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.906
WELL, NO, AH,
I THOUGHT...

07:30.074 --> 07:31.992
MOM, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
WE HAD THE CHOICE.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.536
UH-HUH.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.124
AND I CHOSE NO.

07:39.625 --> 07:43.920
BUT, UH, YES WAS
A CLOSE SECOND.

07:44.755 --> 07:47.132
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND THIS AT ALL.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.343
YOU GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO CHURCH.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.012
IT'S HOT.
IT'S BORING.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.513
THE MUSIC SUCKS.
THE PASTOR'S UGLY.

07:53.681 --> 07:54.973
I HAVE TO
WEAR A TIE.

07:55.141 --> 07:58.351
I HAVE TO WEAR A BRA.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.771
ENOUGH.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.525
WHAT ABOUT HYDE? I MEAN,
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.112
WHILE I RESPECT
THE JUDEO CHRISTIAN ETHIC,

08:09.280 --> 08:10.947
AS WELL AS THE EASTERN
PHILOSOPHIES

08:11.115 --> 08:13.074
AND, OF COURSE,
THE TEACHINGS OF MOHAMMED,

08:13.242 --> 08:15.911
I FIND THAT ORGANIZED RELIGIONS
HAVE CORRUPTED THOSE BELIEFS

08:16.078 --> 08:18.622
TO JUSTIFY COUNTLESS ATROCITIES
THROUGHOUT HISTORY.

08:18.789 --> 08:22.083
WERE I TO ATTEND CHURCH,
I'D BE A HYPOCRITE.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.383
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:30.551 --> 08:32.719
I AM LEAVING
IN 5 MINUTES.

08:32.887 --> 08:36.306
AND I'M SURE YOU WILL MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.602
NO. YOU'LL MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.479
AND YOU DRAG HER WITH YOU.

08:42.647 --> 08:48.777
SOMETHING TELLS ME I WILL NOT
BE SITTING IN THAT PEW ALONE.

08:58.746 --> 09:01.748
HEY, KITTY, THE PINCIOTTIS
ARE ALL HERE.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.709
WHERE'S THE REST
OF TEAM FORMAN?

09:04.877 --> 09:07.254
OH, I'M ALL ALONE TODAY.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.130
ALL ALONE?

09:09.298 --> 09:12.175
ICK! THAT'S JUST
EMBARRASSING.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.843
WELL, THAT'S A SHAME.

09:14.011 --> 09:16.054
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO
HAS SOME CONFESSING TO DO,

09:16.222 --> 09:19.432
IT'S THAT DIRTY,
DIRTY SON OF YOURS.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.686
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

09:22.853 --> 09:25.564
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN, MA'AM?

09:25.731 --> 09:28.191
DO YOU SEE ANYONE?

09:32.238 --> 09:34.781
I LOVE IT HERE, MAN.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.284
THE GUY UP THERE
TELLS STORIES,

09:37.451 --> 09:39.869
THAT GUY WAILS
ON THE ORGAN,

09:40.037 --> 09:43.498
YOU CAN SING AS LOUD
AS YOU WANT.

09:43.666 --> 09:47.419
IT'S ALMOST A RELIGIOUS
EXPERIENCE.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.380
I KIND OF THINK THIS
IS WHAT HEAVEN'S

09:50.548 --> 09:52.257
GONNA BE LIKE, YOU KNOW.

09:52.425 --> 09:56.595
PLUS THEY'LL HAVE
AN OPEN BAR.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.817
RIGHT THIS WAY.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.361
WIPE YOUR FEET,
PLEASE.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.406
SORRY, NO FLASH
PHOTOGRAPHY.

10:16.574 --> 10:17.782
NEXT.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.034
OH, THAT'S US.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.493
FORMAN, PARTY OF 4.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.245
I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T LET YOU IN.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.914
WHAT?

10:25.708 --> 10:27.375
ALL OF US OR...

10:27.543 --> 10:30.086
JUST LAURIE?

10:30.254 --> 10:31.630
ALL OF YOU.

10:31.797 --> 10:34.299
HI, LAURIE.

10:37.762 --> 10:41.181
KITTY, IF YOU'D ONLY GONE
TO CHURCH WITH YOUR FAMILY,

10:41.349 --> 10:42.682
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

10:42.850 --> 10:46.394
SO, DOWN YOU GO.

10:46.562 --> 10:48.396
All: AAH!

10:48.564 --> 10:51.274
HA HA HA HA!
I LOVE THAT GAG.

10:52.276 --> 10:55.236
STEP ASIDE,
WOULD YOU PLEASE?

10:55.404 --> 10:56.863
NEXT.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.658
HEY THERE, HO THERE.
HI THERE, COMING THROUGH.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.746
OH, YOU HAVE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.331
WHAT CAN I DO?

11:06.499 --> 11:10.126
THEY WENT TO CHURCH.

11:10.294 --> 11:13.505
HERE'S 20. CAN YOU
FIND US A PLACE UP FRONT?

11:16.550 --> 11:17.759
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S IT.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.052
I'M KICKING
BOB'S ASS.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.387
RED!

11:20.554 --> 11:23.098
WELL, KITTY, WE'RE
GOING TO HELL ANYWAY.

11:30.898 --> 11:37.362
WELL, THAT'S JUST
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.908
THANKS, MAN.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.502
HOW WAS CHURCH?

11:52.670 --> 11:53.753
GREAT!

11:53.921 --> 11:56.965
I FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO
WITH OUR SINNER CHILDREN.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.343
KITTY, OUR KIDS ARE FINE.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.803
OH, REALLY?

12:01.971 --> 12:03.179
SO, WHY IS LAURIE...

12:03.347 --> 12:05.348
HEY, HEY.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.183
IF WE'RE GONNA START
TAKING SHOTS AT OUR KIDS,

12:07.351 --> 12:10.311
LET'S FOCUS ON ERIC.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.147
OKAY, SEE, NOW,
THAT'S THE POINT.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.733
HE NEEDS TO LEARN
RIGHT FROM WRONG.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.193
I DON'T WANT HIM
TURNING BAD.

12:17.361 --> 12:20.363
OH, KITTY. I DON'T THINK
ERIC'S GONNA TURN BAD.

12:20.531 --> 12:24.659
HE'S TOO MUCH
OF A PANTY-WAIST.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.246
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE
DEFENDING THEM, RED.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.207
YOU FEEL GUILTY BECAUSE
YOU SET A BAD EXAMPLE.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.959
HEY, I GO TO CHURCH.

12:33.127 --> 12:37.130
JUST NOT DURING TELEVISED
SPORTING EVENTS.

12:39.216 --> 12:42.218
YOU KNOW, KITTY, WHEN
MY DESTROYER WENT DOWN

12:42.386 --> 12:43.678
IN THE SOUTH PACIF...

12:43.846 --> 12:47.223
OH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

12:47.391 --> 12:50.685
FINE. IF I THOUGHT THE KIDS
WEREN'T GOING BECAUSE OF ME,

12:50.853 --> 12:52.896
I'D GO.

12:53.063 --> 12:57.108
FORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK THAT,
SO I'M NOT GOING.

12:57.276 --> 13:00.445
WELL, THAT'S ALL
WELL AND GOOD, RED,

13:00.613 --> 13:02.238
BUT SINCE THEY
WON'T GO TO CHURCH,

13:02.406 --> 13:04.282
I'M BRINGING
THE CHURCH TO THEM.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.409
I'VE ASKED DAVE, THE
CHURCH'S YOUTH MINISTER,

13:06.577 --> 13:10.121
TO COME HERE FOR DINNER,
AND HE SAID, "GROOVY."

13:11.248 --> 13:12.832
SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.292
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

13:14.460 --> 13:15.668
I DON'T HAVE TO BE THERE,
RIGHT? NO.

13:15.836 --> 13:18.922
SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.217
YOU SHOULD REALLY GO
TO CHURCH, ERIC.

13:22.384 --> 13:25.386
'CAUSE GOD,
HE SEES EVERYTHING.

13:25.554 --> 13:29.015
IT'S WHY I LIVE MY LIFE
GOOD AND PURE.

13:29.183 --> 13:32.811
KELSO, YOU WERE DATING
TWO GIRLS AT THE SAME TIME.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.604
YEAH, BUT GOD
DIDN'T SEE THAT.

13:34.772 --> 13:38.483
I WAS IN MY VAN, AND HE
CAN'T SEE THROUGH LEAD.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.533
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO
A RELIGIOUS ARGUMENT,

13:46.700 --> 13:51.412
BUT MY GOD CAN KICK
YOUR GOD'S ASS.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.669
GOD IS DEAD, MAN.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.963
IT SAID SO
IN TIME MAGAZINE.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.840
NO, MAN.

14:02.007 --> 14:05.885
I SAT NEXT TO GOD ONCE
ON THE BUS.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.470
HE TOLD ME THE MEANING
OF LIFE,

14:07.638 --> 14:11.224
AND THEN HE
GAVE ME A PRETZEL.

14:11.392 --> 14:14.060
SO WHAT'S THE MEANING
OF LIFE, MAN?

14:14.228 --> 14:19.774
UH, YEAH. I GUESS I
SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN IT DOWN.

14:20.693 --> 14:24.070
BUT IT WAS
A GOOD PRETZEL, MAN.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.574
MAYBE THIS LIFE DOESN'T
EVEN MATTER, YOU KNOW.

14:27.741 --> 14:30.910
MAYBE WE'RE NOT EVEN HERE.

14:31.078 --> 14:36.666
OR NO. MAYBE I'M HERE,
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.752
HELLO?

14:40.629 --> 14:43.506
YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEST
THING GOD EVER DID WAS?

14:43.674 --> 14:46.342
BOOBS!

14:46.510 --> 14:50.805
YES. AND GOD SAID,
LET THERE BE BOOBS.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.850
AND THEN THERE WERE BOOBS.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.436
HEY, IF GOD IS ALL-POWERFUL,

14:56.604 --> 15:01.691
CAN HE MAKE A BOOB SO BIG
THAT EVEN HE CAN'T LIFT IT?

15:01.859 --> 15:04.319
WELL, THAT'S
A GOOD QUESTION, MAN.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.989
I'LL ASK HIM NEXT TIME
I'M ON THE BUS.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.619
OH, MY GOD!
HERE COMES MICHAEL.

15:12.786 --> 15:15.538
ISN'T HE GORGEOUS?

15:16.332 --> 15:20.877
JACKIE, HE'S THE DOG THAT LIED
AND CHEATED ON YOU, REMEMBER?

15:21.045 --> 15:24.464
GOOD! GOOD! KEEP
SAYING STUFF LIKE THAT

15:24.632 --> 15:27.592
SO THAT I DON'T THROW
MYSELF AT HIM.

15:28.218 --> 15:30.887
GEE, I'LL TRY.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.098
OH, HEY.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.224
EXCUSE ME.

15:35.392 --> 15:36.559
HEY, MICHAEL.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.437
YOU SUBMENTAL
TWO-TIMING DOG.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.649
HEY, JACKIE.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.233
SO WHERE YOU OFF TO?

15:44.401 --> 15:47.904
YOU LYING, CHEATING
DIRTBAG JERK.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.739
WELL, I'M JUST GONNA
GO OVER TO THE HUB,

15:49.907 --> 15:52.659
GROW MY BEARD, YOU KNOW.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.828
WELL, THAT'S NEAT.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.956
SO, THEY ALLOW SCUMWADS
IN THERE WHO LIE

15:58.123 --> 15:59.415
TO THEIR GIRLFRIENDS

15:59.583 --> 16:03.127
AND CHEAT ON THEM
AND BREAK THEIR HEARTS?

16:05.422 --> 16:09.759
UH... I GUESS SO. YEAH.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.180
NOW, I KNOW SOME
OF THE KIDS TODAY

16:14.348 --> 16:15.932
THINK THAT GOD'S
A REAL DOWNER,

16:16.100 --> 16:19.644
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
HE'S AN UPPER.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.187
AND LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING,

16:21.355 --> 16:24.023
THERE'S A MUCH BETTER DRUG
THAN LSD OR PCP.

16:24.191 --> 16:28.069
I GET HIGH ON G-O-D.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.448
[CLEAR THROAT]
VIRGIN.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.996
BLESS YOU.

16:38.872 --> 16:41.457
OKAY, WHY AM I HERE?

16:41.625 --> 16:45.962
BECAUSE YOU'RE A YOUNG SOUL
IN MY CARE. NOW SIT, DAMMIT.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.881
SORRY, DAVE.

16:52.261 --> 16:55.304
I HAVE A SOFT SPOT
FOR VIRGINS.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.478
'CAUSE THEY'RE SUCH
A CHALLENGE.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.774
[NERVOUSLY]
RELIGION CAN
BE COOL.

17:06.942 --> 17:10.278
IN FACT, JESUS WAS A LOT
LIKE ANOTHER FAMOUS REBEL.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.613
FONZIE.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.991
BUT WHERE FONZIE
SAYS, "AYYY".

17:15.159 --> 17:19.662
JESUS SAYS,
AYY-MEN.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.334
BUT, DAVE, COULD JESUS
START A JUKEBOX

17:25.502 --> 17:28.129
JUST BY HITTING IT?

17:28.297 --> 17:32.133
HE COULD, BUT JESUS DOESN'T
LIKE TO HIT ANYTHING.

17:32.301 --> 17:36.262
DID HE EVER WATERSKI
OVER A SHARK?

17:36.430 --> 17:40.975
OKAY, DOES ANYONE HAVE A
QUESTION ABOUT THE BIBLE?

17:41.143 --> 17:43.144
I DO.

17:43.312 --> 17:46.439
DO YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN PLACE?

17:51.236 --> 17:52.528
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:52.696 --> 17:57.116
