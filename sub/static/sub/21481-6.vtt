00:39.572 --> 00:42.302
We're not a threat. We're salvation.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.568
The world will have to deal with us.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.904
-Previously on The 4400:
-My name is Daniel Armand.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.777
- Know who I am?
- With the Nova Group?

00:50.950 --> 00:53.748
I called to arrange a truce
and to talk about Shawn Farrell.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.888
We need to discuss his future.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.650
Because unless you and I can come
to some kind of agreement,

00:58.825 --> 01:00.053
I'm not sure he's gonna have one.

01:00.226 --> 01:03.320
Believe me, I know which bench
I dedicated to my husband and son.

01:03.496 --> 01:07.626
They died in a car accident
shortly before I was abducted.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.634
Our enemies are more resourceful
than we imagined.

01:10.804 --> 01:13.671
And they've let loose a terrible evil
into your time.

01:14.307 --> 01:15.365
This evil, there has to be

01:15.542 --> 01:18.010
- some other way to deal with it.
- There is. You.

01:19.345 --> 01:21.006
You are the other way.

01:26.219 --> 01:27.743
Oh, Tom. Good, you're here.

01:28.788 --> 01:29.948
Yeah, just like always.

01:30.123 --> 01:31.647
Well, come on.
We need to get started.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.058
Started with what?

01:35.462 --> 01:36.986
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:37.163 --> 01:40.599
Sure you do. Come on, let's go.
She's waiting.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.130
What is this?

01:47.874 --> 01:51.833
I brought her in. You can just do it,
and we can get on with our day.

01:52.011 --> 01:53.000
It?

01:56.583 --> 01:57.948
No.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.245
- No way, I'm not.
- Tom, you're supposed to do this.

02:00.420 --> 02:03.446
- They told you so.
- I know. It's just...

02:05.391 --> 02:07.052
They didn't say why.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.555
- I don't think I can.
- Maybe I'm bad.

02:11.764 --> 02:13.732
Maybe I'll kill a bunch of people.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.197
You can stop it.

02:15.368 --> 02:19.828
I could be responsible for millions
of deaths, unless you do something.

02:20.006 --> 02:21.234
We got a lot to do today.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.142
It's all right, Tom. I don't mind.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.348
- Come on.
- Take the needle.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.347
Come on, Tom.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.787
Do it.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.583
Do it.

02:41.060 --> 02:42.049
I'm sorry.

03:34.113 --> 03:35.842
I can't find it.

03:36.015 --> 03:38.176
I can't find it.

03:38.351 --> 03:39.784
I know you're listening.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.682
I know you put it
somewhere inside of me.

03:41.854 --> 03:43.845
I'm gonna find it.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.656
I can't find it.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.223
I can't find the bug.

03:50.396 --> 03:53.923
I can't find it. I can't find the bug.

03:54.734 --> 03:58.761
I know you put it
inside me somewhere.

04:00.473 --> 04:02.441
I know you're listening.
I'm gonna find it.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.201
I'm gonna get an x-ray
of my whole body.

04:04.377 --> 04:07.312
Maia's it! Maia's it!

04:13.186 --> 04:15.347
- I'm gonna get you, Amy!
- No, you won't.

04:15.521 --> 04:17.579
Yes, I will.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.926
Maia.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.991
- Maia, are you all right?
- It hurts.

04:29.168 --> 04:30.328
I can help you.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.304
It's just a bump, Shawn.

04:33.473 --> 04:34.701
I can make it better.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.045
- Oh, that hurts.
- You're getting better.

04:44.717 --> 04:47.777
Hey, let her go! You're hurting her!

04:47.954 --> 04:49.182
Somebody help!

04:49.355 --> 04:51.346
Let go! Help!

04:51.524 --> 04:53.890
- What's going on?
- He's killing her! Get him away!

04:54.060 --> 04:55.493
Mister Farrell, let go.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.960
Stay away from her!

04:58.131 --> 05:00.998
- Stand back.
- I don't understand. I was healing her.

05:01.834 --> 05:05.167
- What happened?
- I was making her better.

06:16.242 --> 06:18.176
Sweetheart.

06:18.745 --> 06:21.543
- Hey, Mom.
- How are you doing?

06:21.881 --> 06:25.009
- I'm okay.
- Maia's vital signs are fine.

06:25.184 --> 06:27.584
There's no lasting damage
that I can detect.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.814
At the moment,
she's mostly just dehydrated.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.249
Sweetheart?

06:33.426 --> 06:36.088
- Mommy?
- What is it?

06:36.929 --> 06:41.195
Why would Shawn hurt me?

06:45.138 --> 06:48.403
Oh, my God. Shawn did this?

06:48.574 --> 06:52.704
He missed some meetings yesterday,
but I had no idea it had gotten this bad.

06:52.879 --> 06:55.939
- How's Shawn? Is he okay?
- We don't know.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.606
We called a psychiatrist for him.
They're back in the bedroom now.

06:58.785 --> 07:02.277
- I wanna see him. He'll feel better.
- lsabelle, not right now.

07:02.455 --> 07:04.946
Let him meet with the doctor
for a while, okay?

07:07.260 --> 07:08.727
Sorry.

07:08.895 --> 07:11.989
This is my daughter lsabelle.
Isabelle, this is Tom Baldwin.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.497
- Hi.
- Shawn told me about you.

07:14.667 --> 07:15.793
Hi.

07:18.538 --> 07:19.869
Hi.

07:23.643 --> 07:26.407
You're staring at me. Why?

07:28.848 --> 07:30.713
How is he?

07:32.118 --> 07:34.552
I gave him a sedative.
He's sleeping right now.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.848
Shawn is experiencing persistent
and powerful auditory hallucinations.

07:38.024 --> 07:40.219
They're contributing
to his delusions.

07:40.393 --> 07:43.385
Delusions? I don't understand.
What's happening to him?

07:43.563 --> 07:45.929
Shawn's symptoms are...

07:46.098 --> 07:48.157
Well, I'm afraid
they're consistent with the onset

07:48.334 --> 07:49.824
of disorganized schizophrenia.

07:50.102 --> 07:52.434
But you're gonna fix him, right?
You're gonna make him better?

07:52.605 --> 07:54.573
Well, I've never seen a case
quite like this.

07:54.740 --> 07:57.174
Typically, schizophrenia
has a gradual onset.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.302
Patients slowly withdraw
from the world

07:59.479 --> 08:01.538
as their symptoms get worse.

08:01.714 --> 08:05.309
But with Shawn, it's almost
as if the disease was just turned on.

08:11.090 --> 08:14.059
Last week, we got a phone call
from Daniel Armand.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.559
He said if we weren't willing
to reach a compromise with Nova,

08:16.729 --> 08:17.889
he'd come gunning for Shawn.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.122
And now it's two days later,

08:19.298 --> 08:21.630
and he just happens to come down
with schizophrenia.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.564
You think the Nova Group
did this to Shawn?

08:24.470 --> 08:26.802
Well, we'll investigate it,
but until the matter's cleared up,

08:26.973 --> 08:28.907
Shawn just can't walk around free.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.273
I mean, okay, he's probably
a victim in this, but his mental state

08:32.445 --> 08:34.572
has been compromised.
He can't control his ability.

08:34.746 --> 08:36.681
Shawn is one of the leaders
of this place.

08:36.849 --> 08:37.975
People love him.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.015
If he just disappears
into the basement at NTAC,

08:40.186 --> 08:41.778
there's gonna be a lot
of unhappiness here.

08:41.953 --> 08:44.183
Nobody's talking
about disappearing anyone.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.121
You need to just distance yourself
from the situation. Just for a second.

08:47.293 --> 08:50.660
Now, we have an insane 4400
with a potentially lethal ability.

08:50.830 --> 08:53.424
This is an ability that he has turned
against my daughter.

08:53.599 --> 08:56.500
If you don't voluntarily remand him
to a psychiatric hospital,

08:56.669 --> 08:59.695
then I'll file a complaint for assault and
take the decision out of your hands.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.066
No!

09:02.742 --> 09:04.505
You can't lock him up.
This isn't his fault.

09:04.677 --> 09:07.202
Isabelle, Shawn is in trouble.
He needs help.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.440
I know he does, and instead,
you just want to abandon him.

09:10.616 --> 09:13.107
He sacrificed for this place.
He told you not to talk to Nova,

09:13.286 --> 09:15.083
even if it meant
they were gonna come after him.

09:15.254 --> 09:17.848
- Now they did, and you cut him loose?
- We're not cutting him loose.

09:18.024 --> 09:20.322
- We are protecting him.
- Oh, by locking him up?

09:20.493 --> 09:24.395
- I guess it's fine for you, right?
- lsabelle, that is not true.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.499
And we are not having this
discussion now. This is not the place.

09:33.439 --> 09:36.602
If you'll agree that Shawn goes
nowhere near a government facility,

09:36.776 --> 09:39.472
we'll commit him to a private hospital
until all this is cleared up.

09:45.618 --> 09:48.314
How much did they tell you
about what I do here at the school?

09:51.724 --> 09:53.817
Not much. You're some sort
of guidance counselor, right?

09:53.993 --> 09:59.124
Something like that. It's more
like a therapist, I guess you could say.

09:59.765 --> 10:03.132
I work with the students here
using my ability.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.099
All the kids here are 4400s,

10:05.271 --> 10:08.763
which means you missed years
of your family's lives.

10:09.241 --> 10:11.801
Your parents had another child
while you were gone.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.843
- Your brother, Curtis?
- Yeah.

10:14.013 --> 10:16.504
Before they got divorced.
I barely know him.

10:16.682 --> 10:17.944
That's where I come in.

10:20.319 --> 10:22.014
It's hard to explain, but if you let me,

10:22.188 --> 10:24.884
I can take you back to the years
when you were gone.

10:25.057 --> 10:28.220
You can meet your brother
when he was baby, see him grow up,

10:28.394 --> 10:30.294
and spend all the time
you need with him,

10:30.463 --> 10:32.397
and build the relationship
you don't have.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.158
I'm sorry. What?
You wanna take me back in time?

10:36.335 --> 10:42.001
No. We'll be going to a world
we create using both our minds.

10:42.174 --> 10:44.665
And it will seem just as real
as this one.

10:50.950 --> 10:53.817
Look, no offense,

10:54.520 --> 10:56.681
but maybe you should worry
about helping yourself.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.489
You think I need help?

11:01.127 --> 11:03.994
You have this sadness inside you.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.859
Not sadness exactly.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.591
I guess rage would be the best word.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.062
It's because of what happened
to your husband and son

11:12.238 --> 11:14.229
all those years ago.

11:15.808 --> 11:17.867
You know about Billy and Paul?

11:18.044 --> 11:20.478
They got killed in a hit-and-run.

11:20.913 --> 11:22.403
The police never caught the guy.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.742
You try to move on...

11:28.921 --> 11:32.049
...and I guess you kind of have.

11:33.092 --> 11:36.289
But you still think about it every day.

11:36.996 --> 11:40.022
And there's still that rage.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.069
How do you know all that?

11:47.039 --> 11:51.408
You have an ability,
and I have an ability.

11:55.147 --> 12:00.175
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm just not up for this.

12:00.653 --> 12:04.919
So is it okay if I go back to class?

12:14.033 --> 12:15.898
You're right to be mad, you know.

12:16.068 --> 12:21.506
The guy? The driver?
He's kind of out there.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.073
It's not fair.

12:30.449 --> 12:33.475
But you did see Shawn Farrell
on Tuesday?

12:34.687 --> 12:38.384
A home loan from the center.
And how did the meeting end?

12:39.592 --> 12:43.688
Oh, well, congratulations.
That's a really nice neighborhood.

12:45.030 --> 12:46.964
No, no, Mister Donavan.
Thanks for your time.

12:47.133 --> 12:50.398
We'll be in touch
if we need anything further.

12:51.637 --> 12:53.798
You know, your nephew is one
of the leaders of the center.

12:53.973 --> 12:55.770
He sees dozens of 4400s every day.

12:55.941 --> 12:59.104
And the ones that we've spoken to
who have registered abilities with us,

12:59.278 --> 13:01.542
they have minor stuff.
Nothing like the capacity

13:01.714 --> 13:03.181
to induce insanity.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.408
And that's assuming
that whoever did this

13:05.584 --> 13:07.711
had to be in proximity to Shawn
to make it happen.

13:07.887 --> 13:09.081
Whoever?

13:09.255 --> 13:11.849
We basically know who did this.
It was Daniel Armand.

13:12.024 --> 13:13.719
Either he did it, or he gave the order.

13:13.893 --> 13:16.453
Well, no, the truth is we don't actually
know that Shawn's condition

13:16.629 --> 13:18.119
is the result of an attack.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.527
Nova's not claiming credit,

13:20.699 --> 13:24.100
and Shawn's exactly the right age
for onset of schizophrenia.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.067
So it's possible
that we're looking for a crime,

13:26.238 --> 13:28.206
and the only thing
we're gonna find is a tragedy.

13:29.775 --> 13:31.402
Then there's nothing we can do.

13:35.214 --> 13:36.374
I cannot accept that.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.244
Nova threatened Shawn.
Shawn got sick.

13:38.417 --> 13:41.978
For right now,
that's all the cause and effect I need.

13:49.762 --> 13:50.922
You're Zachary?

13:51.096 --> 13:53.326
- Thanks for meeting me out here.
- It's all right.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.525
Matthew said you had something
you wanted to discuss.

13:57.136 --> 13:59.536
About six weeks ago,
a friend of mine from quarantine,

13:59.705 --> 14:02.799
she asked me to meet her
for dinner.

14:02.975 --> 14:07.378
So I go, and she's asking me
all sorts of questions.

14:07.546 --> 14:09.844
Now, she never came right out
and said it,

14:10.015 --> 14:13.883
but I swear she was feeling me out
to see if I would join the Nova Group.

14:14.053 --> 14:15.782
She was recruiting you?

14:16.422 --> 14:18.947
I mean, she used to bitch
about the government all the time.

14:19.124 --> 14:21.888
- I guess she just finally got fed up.
- Zachary.

14:22.061 --> 14:24.529
If you got a name, give it to me.

14:27.967 --> 14:29.559
Jane Nance.

14:31.103 --> 14:33.333
Thank you for coming forward.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.905
Hi.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.378
Todd?

14:52.858 --> 14:55.554
Ms. Mareva. What's up?

14:55.728 --> 14:59.129
Those things you said about me.
They're very private.

15:00.032 --> 15:01.226
How did you know?

15:02.935 --> 15:05.563
Sometimes, when I'm talking
to somebody,

15:05.738 --> 15:10.471
if they feel something real strong,
I feel it too.

15:11.877 --> 15:15.438
And then I know
why they feel that way.

15:15.614 --> 15:16.603
I see it.

15:17.549 --> 15:22.509
So you saw what happened
to my family?

15:22.688 --> 15:26.021
Not the whole thing.
I just get, like, fragments.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.896
I saw the two cars hit.
I saw this guy.

15:31.063 --> 15:33.588
There were empty beer bottles
by his seat.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.757
He thought about getting out.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.996
Calling the cops.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.200
I guess he changed his mind.

15:41.874 --> 15:46.038
The man who hit them,
you know who he is?

15:46.211 --> 15:48.805
Yeah, I already wrote it down.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.773
I figured you'd want it.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.885
"Keane Driscoll."

16:10.169 --> 16:12.160
Security told me you were up here.

16:12.338 --> 16:13.362
What are you doing?

16:13.539 --> 16:15.905
I'm packing Shawn's stuff.
I'm taking him out of the hospital.

16:16.075 --> 16:19.135
Isabelle, I have to caution you
against overreaction.

16:19.311 --> 16:22.610
I know you're worried about Shawn,
but all we have is a tip.

16:22.781 --> 16:25.477
We might know the name
of one person in the Nova Group.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.175
What's my dad gonna do with that?

16:27.353 --> 16:30.220
Let me guess, call NTAC? What are
they gonna do for Shawn that I can't?

16:30.389 --> 16:31.981
They're equipped
to deal with 4400s.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.181
Not as well as I am.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.120
- lsabelle.
- Matthew, get out of my way.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.024
What are you gonna do?

16:38.197 --> 16:40.392
We don't even know if that tip
is any good.

16:40.899 --> 16:43.390
And if this woman, Jane Nance,
is in the Nova Group,

16:43.569 --> 16:46.060
there's no guarantee
she's the one doing this to Shawn.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.468
If she's not, she'll get me closer
to the person who is.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.575
She was recruited into Nova, right?
So she'll know at least one name.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.679
I'll find that person. If they're not
the one, they'll know a name too.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.008
And eventually, I'll find the person
who is hurting Shawn,

16:57.182 --> 16:59.207
and I'll make him stop.

17:02.121 --> 17:04.589
Wait. Wait a minute.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.055
Do you remember the first time
I came to see you?

17:07.226 --> 17:09.194
You were so sad.

17:09.361 --> 17:13.593
You didn't know who you were.
Why you grew up so fast.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.961
Why you were making
your mother so sick.

17:16.135 --> 17:19.161
And I told you,
you were one of the lucky ones.

17:19.338 --> 17:22.773
You have a purpose, a job to do.

17:22.941 --> 17:25.307
I even told you what it was.

17:25.477 --> 17:26.603
Do you remember?

17:28.113 --> 17:29.978
Say it.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.983
I'm supposed to eliminate the 4400.

17:36.155 --> 17:38.055
That's right.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.691
Not everyone from the future
thinks they're a good thing.

17:40.859 --> 17:43.589
Not everyone thinks
they're gonna save the world.

17:43.762 --> 17:49.064
All this talk of a catastrophe the 4400
are supposed to prevent, it's lies.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.259
They are the catastrophe.
All of them.

17:51.437 --> 17:53.997
Your father, Shawn...

17:54.940 --> 17:58.569
And if he's in trouble,
that's good for us.

17:59.611 --> 18:01.010
So you keep telling me.

18:03.682 --> 18:05.047
Goodbye.

18:05.217 --> 18:08.675
No, I can't allow you to do this.

18:08.854 --> 18:13.348
You're not ready to be on your own.
You need me. You need my guidance.

18:25.971 --> 18:27.939
I don't think I do, Matthew.

18:32.077 --> 18:33.704
Today's graduation day.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.626
Shawn?

18:51.797 --> 18:53.025
Isabelle.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.894
We have to go now, okay?

18:57.069 --> 18:59.970
- lsabelle. Isabelle.
- Okay.

19:01.673 --> 19:06.736
My back teeth are melting,
and they're gonna run down my throat.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.812
I can feel it.

19:09.481 --> 19:13.076
It's okay.
I'm gonna make you better.

19:13.519 --> 19:14.747
Just come with me, okay?

19:16.688 --> 19:17.985
Okay?

19:20.225 --> 19:24.093
Her name is Jane Nance,
and she lives about 20 minutes away.

19:24.263 --> 19:26.094
We think the tip is good.

19:26.265 --> 19:27.630
If she really is a member of Nova,

19:27.799 --> 19:31.235
you can bet she'll be ready
to defend herself, so let's be careful.

19:31.403 --> 19:33.598
Here you go, Triton.

19:35.874 --> 19:37.569
Here you go.

19:38.677 --> 19:41.373
You've been a very patient boy.

19:41.980 --> 19:43.777
Fidget?

19:45.751 --> 19:48.413
What did I tell you
about sitting on the TV?

20:01.266 --> 20:02.392
Not yet, Herkie.

20:15.881 --> 20:16.870
Who are you?

20:19.117 --> 20:21.347
We all know what it's like
to hit bottom.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.852
We wouldn't be here if we didn't.

20:24.022 --> 20:26.388
It comes in a different way
for each of us,

20:26.558 --> 20:32.087
that moment when we realize
our drinking is out of control.

20:38.503 --> 20:40.130
I'm sorry to interrupt.

20:40.305 --> 20:43.001
It's okay. It's okay. Come on in.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.070
Grab a seat.

20:47.746 --> 20:51.842
I was just saying, my name is Keane,
and I'm an alcoholic.

20:52.017 --> 20:54.349
Hi Keane.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.092
Jane Nance!

21:22.681 --> 21:24.740
Oh, my God.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.542
What?

21:34.126 --> 21:36.560
Get those animals away from her.

21:37.396 --> 21:38.988
What the hell happened here?

21:39.164 --> 21:42.031
It's like all these pets she keeps,
they turned on her.

21:42.200 --> 21:46.364
Maybe someone
turned them on her.

21:47.606 --> 21:49.767
He died very quickly.

21:50.842 --> 21:53.242
It could have been a massive stroke,
maybe a coronary.

21:53.412 --> 21:56.074
I'll call an ambulance
and the coroner.

21:56.248 --> 21:58.148
Mister Tyler.

21:58.617 --> 22:02.144
Those two NTAC agents are here
again. They say they need to see you.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.084
Look, Mister Tyler,

22:04.256 --> 22:05.780
Isabelle broke Shawn
out of the hospital.

22:05.957 --> 22:07.322
We know that for a fact.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.791
And now we learn that Matthew Ross,
a 36-year-old man,

22:10.962 --> 22:13.726
just happened to die of a stroke
on the floor of Shawn's living room.

22:13.899 --> 22:15.526
Within the hour,
Jane Nance dies as well.

22:15.701 --> 22:17.931
I mean, are you telling us
that you don't see a connection?

22:18.103 --> 22:19.502
You're talking about my daughter.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.605
She shouldn't have taken Shawn,
I'll admit that.

22:21.773 --> 22:24.571
She can be immature sometimes, yes.
But she is not a killer.

22:24.743 --> 22:26.870
Any idea where lsabelle
may have taken Shawn?

22:27.045 --> 22:28.512
No.

22:28.947 --> 22:32.439
If she calls, I'll try to convince her
to come in and I'll let you know.

22:32.617 --> 22:34.380
That's the best I can do.

22:37.456 --> 22:39.287
Is there anything else?

22:39.658 --> 22:40.682
See you.

22:44.663 --> 22:46.130
Hey.

22:46.298 --> 22:48.061
It's okay to be shy.

22:48.233 --> 22:51.600
I remember my first meeting.
I didn't say anything either.

22:51.770 --> 22:56.537
I was at rock bottom,
embarrassed just to be breathing.

22:58.276 --> 22:59.436
How long ago was that?

22:59.611 --> 23:01.704
About nine years.

23:03.648 --> 23:05.206
I was in a car accident.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.874
The truth is,
I can barely remember it.

23:07.052 --> 23:11.989
I came to and I knew
I had to change my life.

23:12.157 --> 23:16.651
So I did. I've been leading
these meetings for five years now.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.489
How about you?
You have a moment like that?

23:21.666 --> 23:24.499
Diana, we opened a trace
on Shawn's cell phone.

23:24.669 --> 23:25.693
Richard Tyler's too.

23:25.871 --> 23:28.533
If lsabelle calls, we'll be listening.

23:28.707 --> 23:32.143
Does this girl scare you
as much as she scares me?

23:32.310 --> 23:35.575
I mean, never mind what she did
or didn't do today.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.578
You just meet her.

23:37.949 --> 23:41.612
I mean, she looks like a normal kid.
Attractive, maybe a bit naive.

23:41.787 --> 23:43.652
But when she says something,

23:43.822 --> 23:45.756
you realize she's looking at you
like you're an ant

23:45.924 --> 23:48.518
and she's just deciding whether or not
she's gonna rip your legs off.

23:50.195 --> 23:53.653
Every other 4400 had a past
before they were taken, a history.

23:53.832 --> 23:54.958
Not her.

23:55.133 --> 23:58.296
She just kind of sprouted.

23:58.904 --> 24:01.464
She's not even a 4400.

24:01.973 --> 24:04.703
She's something else.
A new category.

24:04.876 --> 24:06.673
We got a hit on the APB.
Shawn's car was spotted

24:06.845 --> 24:09.905
- headed east on Forbes Avenue.
- That's in Everett. Let's go.

24:10.081 --> 24:12.481
Diana, I need to make a stop
at home first.

24:33.672 --> 24:35.970
I'm not taking those.
I'm not taking those.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.132
There's radio antennas
inside of there.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.437
And that's how they hear
what I'm thinking.

24:40.612 --> 24:41.772
- I'm not taking those.
- Shawn.

24:41.947 --> 24:43.278
Shawn, there are no radio antennas.

24:43.448 --> 24:46.383
They're just pills.
They make you feel better.

24:46.551 --> 24:49.645
The label says you're supposed
to take them every four hours.

24:50.422 --> 24:52.549
Shawn, stop that.

24:56.595 --> 24:59.564
Wait a minute. There he is.

25:14.813 --> 25:16.872
It's so late.

25:20.285 --> 25:21.718
You scared me.

25:22.921 --> 25:27.051
I'm sorry. Someone called in a tip
on Shawn's car.

25:27.225 --> 25:30.194
It was abandoned, though.
He's still missing.

25:34.966 --> 25:36.729
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.033
I don't know.

25:41.139 --> 25:42.663
No.

25:44.776 --> 25:46.505
A boy at school, he has this gift.

25:46.678 --> 25:50.580
He sees things,
things that already happened.

25:52.150 --> 25:55.313
He says he saw the accident
that killed Billy.

25:56.254 --> 25:58.950
Oh, my God. Baby.

25:59.724 --> 26:02.921
- Why would he tell you that?
- Because.

26:03.595 --> 26:05.893
He also gave me the name
of the man who did it.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.895
I went to see him, Thomas.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.094
You did what?

26:13.972 --> 26:16.566
He was leading an AA meeting.

26:16.741 --> 26:20.643
He told me he had a car accident
while he was drunk nine years ago.

26:21.446 --> 26:24.279
Alana, sweetie,
if this really is the guy,

26:24.449 --> 26:26.508
- we'll look into it.
- Based on what?

26:26.685 --> 26:29.051
The visions of a 4400
who was a little kid

26:29.220 --> 26:30.278
when the accident happened?

26:30.455 --> 26:32.423
Alana, please.

26:32.591 --> 26:36.186
Don't go see this guy again.
It could be dangerous.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.159
You should pick up, Thomas.

26:44.536 --> 26:48.632
Yeah, but are you sure you're okay?

26:48.807 --> 26:50.536
I'm fine.

26:50.709 --> 26:52.643
Better than your nephew anyway.

26:57.415 --> 26:59.110
Baldwin.

27:08.026 --> 27:10.824
The place is owned by a 4400
named Jorge Molina.

27:10.996 --> 27:13.760
Fire Department found some burnt
remains inside. They think it's him.

27:13.932 --> 27:15.593
- What started the fire?
- They're not sure.

27:15.767 --> 27:16.961
Apparently, Molina had a habit

27:17.135 --> 27:18.966
of leaving oily rags
laying around the garage.

27:19.137 --> 27:21.628
Someone in Health and Safety
gave him a bunch of citations for it.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.707
Said it was a fire hazard.
Guess they were right, huh?

27:24.876 --> 27:27.276
Yeah, either that,
or lsabelle found the name

27:27.445 --> 27:30.073
of another member
of the Nova Group.

27:43.294 --> 27:45.660
- Hello?
- This will all be over soon, Daddy.

27:45.830 --> 27:46.819
Hello?

27:46.998 --> 27:49.990
I found out who's doing this to Shawn.
It's Daniel Armand.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.730
- lsabelle?
- The last Nova I talked to told me.

27:54.906 --> 27:56.271
Isabelle.

27:56.441 --> 27:58.033
Where are you?

27:58.443 --> 28:01.378
I'm just waiting for him to come home,
and then I'm gonna make him stop.

28:01.546 --> 28:04.572
Isabelle, if you know where Armand is,
we'll tell NTAC.

28:04.749 --> 28:06.182
They'll take care of it.

28:06.818 --> 28:10.083
I'm not stopping.
I'm not stopping until Shawn's better.

28:13.992 --> 28:18.622
Daddy, when all this is done,
can I come home?

28:20.699 --> 28:22.564
Will they let me,

28:23.101 --> 28:24.534
or am I in too much trouble?

28:24.703 --> 28:28.230
I don't know. Maybe.

28:29.474 --> 28:31.408
If you stop now, maybe.

28:32.444 --> 28:35.572
Just tell me where you're going
so I can come meet you.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.817
Okay.

28:46.591 --> 28:49.219
Diana, we just intercepted a call
to Richard Tyler's phone.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.622
- It was lsabelle.
- Where is she?

28:50.795 --> 28:52.387
She's headed to an address
in Munhall.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.055
She says Daniel Armand is there.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.943
You'd better not be hurting him.

29:12.117 --> 29:14.915
I'm not. It's almost done.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.263
Isabelle.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.902
Shawn, are you okay?

29:32.070 --> 29:34.436
Yeah, I think so.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.336
What happened?
I don't remember anything.

29:44.149 --> 29:46.140
What's Armand doing here?

29:46.317 --> 29:49.343
He was hurting you.
He broke your mind.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.785
That's his ability,
but I made him stop.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.321
He's yours now.
You can do what you want.

29:56.494 --> 29:58.291
Now she wants you to kill me.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.889
I'm not killing anybody, lsabelle.

30:01.065 --> 30:02.999
If you don't, she will.

30:04.002 --> 30:05.196
Is that true?

30:05.370 --> 30:08.134
I did what I had to do
to make you better.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.570
What does it matter anyway?
You're not sick anymore.

30:10.742 --> 30:13.836
I know. I know. Thank you.

30:14.012 --> 30:16.503
But it's over. It's over.

30:16.681 --> 30:18.376
I'm better. We have Armand.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.245
Let's just go.
We can walk away.

30:25.957 --> 30:28.221
You don't really know
this girl at all, do you?

30:29.294 --> 30:30.727
You think she's one of us?

30:30.895 --> 30:32.863
Don't listen to him, lsabelle.

30:33.031 --> 30:35.932
- Stop talking.
- She's not, Shawn.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.133
She killed her way across town
to find me,

30:39.304 --> 30:41.431
and there's no way
she's walking away.

30:41.606 --> 30:43.870
I said stop talking now.

30:44.042 --> 30:47.170
Isabelle, don't. Isabelle, don't.

30:47.812 --> 30:52.476
For the record, Daniel,
I didn't kill your people.

30:52.650 --> 30:54.618
Not exactly.

30:55.153 --> 30:57.383
All I did was turn their abilities
against them.

30:59.057 --> 31:01.525
And what do you do again?

31:01.693 --> 31:03.593
Oh, right.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.263
You make people crazy.

31:06.431 --> 31:07.625
No.

31:09.467 --> 31:11.230
Isabelle.

31:12.937 --> 31:14.734
Isabelle, stop it!

31:15.874 --> 31:17.307
Stop it!

31:27.018 --> 31:30.078
They wanna take my organs out.

31:31.289 --> 31:32.950
All of them.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.584
They're halfway done.

31:37.662 --> 31:39.527
They're halfway done.

31:39.697 --> 31:41.858
Why did you do that to him?

31:43.868 --> 31:46.268
He was still a threat to you, Shawn.

31:46.437 --> 31:50.134
If we just left, what's to keep him
from attacking you again?

31:51.209 --> 31:54.178
Everything I did,
I did to make you better.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.143
I don't regret any of it.

31:58.850 --> 32:02.081
If I had to kill a hundred people,
I would have.

32:04.555 --> 32:06.352
Who are you?

32:14.232 --> 32:16.860
If anyone gets any resistance
from the girl or Daniel Armand,

32:17.035 --> 32:19.333
do not hesitate to use deadly force!

32:19.504 --> 32:21.699
Tom, anything to add?

32:21.873 --> 32:23.500
- No, let's move.
- Stop!

32:24.242 --> 32:25.971
Can't do that, Mr. Tyler.
We need to end this.

32:26.144 --> 32:27.941
Look, if you go in there
with your guns out,

32:28.112 --> 32:29.977
this could end badly for everybody.

32:30.148 --> 32:32.742
Let me talk to lsabelle,
see if I can get her to come out quietly.

32:35.053 --> 32:36.987
You guys have got
the place surrounded, right?

32:37.455 --> 32:39.946
If I'm gone more than five minutes,
you can just come in anyway.

32:46.097 --> 32:47.291
Go.

32:49.233 --> 32:52.566
Isabelle? Shawn?

32:55.573 --> 32:57.131
Richard.

32:59.744 --> 33:01.803
You've gotta talk to her.
You've gotta talk to her.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.972
She wants to fight them.
She's gonna get everyone killed.

33:05.149 --> 33:09.017
Daddy, we can get past them.
You can help me.

33:09.187 --> 33:11.155
You can get the guns
out of their hands, right?

33:11.322 --> 33:14.621
No, lsabelle! We're not here
to fight the government. Not today.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.123
I don't have a choice.

33:16.294 --> 33:17.921
Yes, you do.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.060
Walk out there with me.

33:21.432 --> 33:22.729
You're gonna get in trouble

33:22.900 --> 33:25.300
for breaking Shawn out of the hospital,
but we can deal with it.

33:25.470 --> 33:28.439
I don't know what happened with
Matthew, but we can deal with that too.

33:28.606 --> 33:30.540
But if you go after those agents,
that is it.

33:30.708 --> 33:34.007
You're an enemy of the government.
They will catch you eventually.

33:34.178 --> 33:36.578
They will put you away forever,
I don't care how strong you are.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.546
And there won't be anything
I can do about it.

33:50.495 --> 33:52.224
All this.

33:53.297 --> 33:57.324
I did it to save Shawn,
and he hates me now.

34:00.204 --> 34:01.535
Isabelle.

34:01.706 --> 34:06.075
Isabelle, I don't hate you.

34:06.778 --> 34:09.871
He's just scared, that's all.
We all are.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.708
Let's go.

34:19.123 --> 34:20.750
They're coming out!

34:27.831 --> 34:29.060
Shawn, are you all right?

34:29.233 --> 34:30.996
Yeah, yeah.

34:33.471 --> 34:37.429
Daniel Armand's inside.
He's all yours.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.263
So this is what it feels like

35:02.433 --> 35:04.628
to watch someone
get away with murder.

35:04.802 --> 35:08.101
If there's no evidence of foul play,
how can there be a murder?

35:08.272 --> 35:11.764
As for the deaths,
Shawn doesn't remember anything.

35:11.943 --> 35:15.276
There's no witnesses.
So officially, we don't have a case.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.937
Yeah, but she did it.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.947
And I can't help but think
when all this is over,

35:20.118 --> 35:22.018
she's gonna do a lot more.

35:27.992 --> 35:30.017
Their names were Billy and Paul.

35:30.194 --> 35:32.958
Paul was my husband.
Billy was our son.

35:34.832 --> 35:39.360
They were killed
in a hit-and-run accident in 1 997.

35:39.537 --> 35:41.630
The same year you hit bottom.

35:45.710 --> 35:48.406
- What does this have to do with me?
- Everything.

35:49.514 --> 35:50.981
You killed them.

36:03.194 --> 36:04.718
Look...

36:05.496 --> 36:08.556
...I told you before. Nine years ago...

36:09.967 --> 36:12.299
...I was a different man.

36:13.804 --> 36:16.272
Something happened. Something...

36:17.575 --> 36:19.304
...terrible.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.941
And I had a choice.

36:22.113 --> 36:27.073
I could end my life,
or I could try to live it better.

36:29.220 --> 36:31.848
And I decided to live.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.389
And I did do better.
I dedicated myself to it.

36:34.559 --> 36:37.426
I mean, look around. I help people.

36:37.595 --> 36:39.153
You do.

36:40.398 --> 36:42.559
And you probably feel
like that's enough.

36:43.834 --> 36:46.268
I'll bet you do go days,
whole weeks even,

36:46.437 --> 36:51.170
without ever thinking
about that other man, and what he did.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.179
I think about it every day.

36:56.347 --> 36:58.815
It never goes away for me.

37:01.085 --> 37:06.489
And I'm going to make sure
it never goes away for you either.

37:08.292 --> 37:10.726
I won't let you forget them.

37:14.298 --> 37:18.325
I'm fine, Daddy.
They treated me fine.

37:18.869 --> 37:22.430
I just need a little time alone, okay?

37:22.773 --> 37:24.536
Isabelle.

37:26.477 --> 37:27.569
You know, sometime very soon,

37:27.745 --> 37:29.736
we're gonna have to talk
about Matthew.

37:30.214 --> 37:32.205
About all of this.

37:45.129 --> 37:46.118
How did you get in here?

37:52.003 --> 37:54.631
Shut the door. We need to talk.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.075
About what?

38:06.851 --> 38:09.115
Some people want me to kill you.

38:10.187 --> 38:12.314
I was hoping you could tell me why.

38:18.362 --> 38:20.262
Who gave you that?

38:21.899 --> 38:23.890
Long story.

38:24.935 --> 38:28.632
Let's just say the woman
who left it for me, she called you evil.

38:28.973 --> 38:31.806
Said if humanity was gonna survive,
you had to die.

38:33.911 --> 38:35.242
What, you think that's funny?

38:35.680 --> 38:37.079
No.

38:38.783 --> 38:42.275
It's just it seems like a lot of people
have opinions about me.

38:42.453 --> 38:46.890
Either I'm the savior,
or I'm the end of the world.

38:48.726 --> 38:50.717
It's nice to have options, I guess.

38:52.496 --> 38:53.895
That man, Matthew?

38:54.699 --> 38:56.758
The one who had a stroke?

38:58.135 --> 39:00.729
He came to me right after I grew up.

39:00.905 --> 39:03.897
He said I was supposed
to do all kinds of things.

39:05.776 --> 39:09.234
Destroy the 4400. Kill them all.

39:10.948 --> 39:13.883
He told me it was the only way
to save the world.

39:16.153 --> 39:17.916
I told him no.

39:18.089 --> 39:21.525
I might have been conceived
in the future, but I'm not their puppet.

39:23.728 --> 39:25.992
He didn't like that.

39:27.665 --> 39:29.223
He's not around anymore.

39:31.769 --> 39:34.033
Neither are those members
of the Nova Group.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.341
Those people were terrorists.

39:37.508 --> 39:39.533
They were murderers.
They were hurting Shawn.

39:41.645 --> 39:44.170
Look, whoever told you that I'm bad,

39:44.348 --> 39:49.012
that I'm some sort
of walking Armageddon, is wrong.

39:49.186 --> 39:50.483
I turned my back on all that.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.124
I'm not a murderer.

39:55.860 --> 39:57.691
You know what?
I don't care how much I scare you.

39:57.862 --> 39:59.329
I don't think you are, either.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.224
You don't know me.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.923
No?

40:07.905 --> 40:08.894
Let's find out.

40:11.242 --> 40:14.700
Here I am, the angel of death.

40:15.146 --> 40:19.310
The end of the human race,
whatever the hell it is they call me.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.813
I won't move. I promise.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.435
No.

40:45.042 --> 40:46.373
Not yet.

40:47.178 --> 40:49.112
Not until I'm sure.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.339
You're not a murderer.

40:51.849 --> 40:53.646
It's okay.

40:54.885 --> 40:57.718
You should take that with you
in case you change your mind.

40:57.888 --> 41:00.220
You better hope I don't.

41:12.102 --> 41:14.127
I made that happen, didn't l?

41:16.006 --> 41:19.567
No, Todd. I did.

41:20.945 --> 41:23.175
I didn't mean to.

41:23.747 --> 41:25.977
I didn't want to.

41:29.186 --> 41:31.154
But I did.

41:42.199 --> 41:43.928
Welcome to Haspel Corp.
How may I help you?

41:44.101 --> 41:47.070
Hi. I have an appointment
with Dennis Ryland.

41:47.238 --> 41:49.763
- My name's lsabelle Tyler.
- Oh, Miss Tyler.

41:49.940 --> 41:51.168
Mister Ryland's expecting you.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.503
Go on up to 24. He's waiting.
