00:34.501 --> 00:36.502
Do you know what day it is?

00:36.503 --> 00:38.337
Yes.

00:38.338 --> 00:40.572
What month?

00:40.573 --> 00:42.241
What year?

00:42.242 --> 00:44.251
Yes.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.645
I want you to
color the flowers in.

00:46.646 --> 00:50.315
So that none of them look
exactly the same.

00:50.316 --> 00:51.417
The petals can either be...

00:51.418 --> 00:53.996
I remember.

00:54.254 --> 00:56.355
Good.

00:56.356 --> 00:58.729
But how can I know for sure?

00:59.726 --> 01:01.326
Four purple flowers.

01:01.327 --> 01:02.694
Four green flowers.

01:02.695 --> 01:04.596
Blue centers on two
purple flowers.

01:04.596 --> 01:05.831
Two green.

01:05.832 --> 01:08.978
Purple centers
on two purple, two green.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.637
Purple and green what?

01:11.638 --> 01:14.706
Flowers.

01:14.707 --> 01:15.774
Green leaves on four...

01:15.775 --> 01:19.645
the four flowers with
purple centers.

01:19.646 --> 01:21.847
Blue leaves on the other four.

01:21.848 --> 01:23.482
That's good.

01:23.483 --> 01:25.451
Now can you show me.

01:25.452 --> 01:28.620
I know these tests
were made for children.

01:28.621 --> 01:31.802
That doesn't mean
they're not useful.

01:34.527 --> 01:36.707
I know this all
seems easy to you now,

01:38.431 --> 01:40.611
but it hasn't always been.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.604
And it may not always be.

01:45.338 --> 01:49.420
And that doesn't mean you
don't have to show me.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.524
Tell me what you see.

03:05.652 --> 03:08.093
The water.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.166
Where is the water?

03:15.328 --> 03:16.678
The ocean.

03:18.731 --> 03:22.140
Are you standing on a beach?

03:23.403 --> 03:24.753
Yes.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.855
Is the sand warm?

03:28.474 --> 03:29.824
Yes.

03:32.779 --> 03:34.229
How about the water?

03:36.583 --> 03:37.933
I don't know.

03:39.252 --> 03:40.602
Go to the water.

03:42.355 --> 03:43.705
I can't.

03:44.357 --> 03:45.707
Why not?

03:49.529 --> 03:52.175
There's broken
glass in the sand.

03:54.434 --> 03:59.515
I want you to use the sand
to cover up the glass,

04:00.607 --> 04:02.912
and make yourself a
path to the ocean.

04:05.345 --> 04:07.547
When your feet touch the water,

04:08.881 --> 04:10.617
you will raise your right hand.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.202
Sleep.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.240
I think you need to
clear your mind.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.550
I'm sorry.

05:43.776 --> 05:44.943
See?

05:44.944 --> 05:46.294
I stopped.

06:14.674 --> 06:17.286
Focus on your body
and your breath.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.295
Focus on your balance.

06:21.114 --> 06:25.320
Know that if you stay
focused, you won't fall.

06:25.418 --> 06:28.788
If you fall, we start
all over again.

07:04.857 --> 07:06.207
Janie?

07:42.962 --> 07:44.312
You look dehydrated.

07:46.732 --> 07:48.434
Thank you.

07:49.902 --> 07:51.252
That's good.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.049
It's easy to forget how much
water our body needs.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.852
Just a little more now.

08:16.796 --> 08:18.146
Thank you.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.028
Your father called this morning.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.930
He didn't want me to wake you.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.298
What he say?

08:53.299 --> 08:56.067
Well, there's good news
and bad news.

08:56.068 --> 08:57.636
Okay.

08:57.637 --> 09:01.973
The bad news is, he may have to
stay in Tokyo a few months more.

09:01.974 --> 09:02.974
And?

09:02.975 --> 09:04.518
And...

09:04.610 --> 09:07.279
I told him how well
you've been doing.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.255
And he wonders if maybe...

09:10.308 --> 09:13.219
you're ready to start spending
some time out of the house.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.170
Really?

09:16.589 --> 09:17.939
Only if you feel ready.

09:18.925 --> 09:20.759
I do.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.530
Good.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.207
It's good to see you smile.

09:48.621 --> 09:51.529
How long do I get to go for?

09:52.692 --> 09:54.303
Lets start with a few hours.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.105
What should I do?

10:01.267 --> 10:02.617
Anything you want.

10:05.137 --> 10:08.841
This time, is your time.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.530
Are you sure you're ready?

10:40.006 --> 10:41.356
Who do you see?

10:43.709 --> 10:45.059
I see me.

13:01.347 --> 13:03.549
Are you all right?

13:05.084 --> 13:08.265
Stem back, this way.

13:11.924 --> 13:13.569
You should be more careful.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.071
There are a lot of ways
this world can hurt you.

14:25.064 --> 14:27.835
One hour and
seventeen minutes late.

14:29.869 --> 14:30.843
I know.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.203
I'm sorry.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.781
I lost track.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.540
I didn't call to remind you,

14:35.541 --> 14:38.847
because I'd like to
treat you as an adult.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.615
But keep an eye on the time.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.659
And call me if
you're going to be late.

14:47.519 --> 14:48.869
Okay.

14:49.421 --> 14:52.363
Now...

14:52.625 --> 14:54.168
tell me about your day.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.395
I don't hear anything.

16:27.586 --> 16:29.288
Maybe it stopped.

16:30.422 --> 16:33.458
Well, it's a big house.

16:33.459 --> 16:36.799
Water runs even when
you're not using it.

16:37.029 --> 16:38.674
It's never happened before.

16:39.098 --> 16:40.398
I'm sure it has.

16:40.399 --> 16:43.434
You just never noticed.

16:43.435 --> 16:46.616
How am I suppose to sleep?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.986
Well, it's stopped now, hasn't it?

16:57.783 --> 16:59.360
But what if it starts again?

21:39.765 --> 21:40.998
Hello?

21:40.999 --> 21:42.701
Are you okay?

21:51.043 --> 21:52.551
Are you okay?

21:53.912 --> 21:55.284
This is embarrassing.

21:55.847 --> 21:58.949
I'm picking up a friend
to go to the airport and...

21:58.950 --> 22:00.527
I got here early.

22:01.019 --> 22:02.527
Oh, okay.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.089
I must've fallen asleep.

22:05.090 --> 22:07.668
I was just checking.

22:08.427 --> 22:09.777
Yup.

22:09.928 --> 22:11.801
No worries.

22:14.599 --> 22:16.734
Have we met before?

22:16.735 --> 22:18.846
I don't think so.

22:19.705 --> 22:21.942
You just look really familiar.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.744
That's me.

22:26.745 --> 22:29.613
I'm Savannah by the way.

22:29.614 --> 22:31.953
Margo.

23:08.653 --> 23:10.161
You're just in time.

23:11.923 --> 23:13.329
I can explain.

23:13.825 --> 23:15.175
I know.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.426
I would've called but,

23:24.536 --> 23:26.579
my phone ran out of batteries.

23:28.006 --> 23:29.356
It's not a punishment.

23:29.975 --> 23:33.021
The rules were put in place
for your protection, little girl.

23:34.746 --> 23:38.260
Everything we do, we do
for you to get better.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.651
I know, but...

23:40.652 --> 23:43.264
And you'll feel
so much better after.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.279
All the way down.

23:59.471 --> 24:00.821
Just try to relax.

24:02.174 --> 24:03.524
Remember,

24:03.608 --> 24:04.958
the more you fight it,

24:05.710 --> 24:07.060
the more it's going to hurt.

24:08.847 --> 24:10.197
But when it's over,

24:11.450 --> 24:13.129
you'll be that much
closer to you again.

24:15.620 --> 24:16.970
Now open.

25:26.157 --> 25:27.961
How are you feeling today?

25:30.996 --> 25:32.346
Better, thank you.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.214
I'm so glad.

25:41.673 --> 25:44.319
You do understand, don't you?

25:46.311 --> 25:48.513
Why I take your well
being so seriously.

25:50.749 --> 25:55.455
Why we do the things that we do.

26:00.158 --> 26:01.508
When your mother died,

26:03.128 --> 26:04.807
I made a promise to your father.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.539
That promise means
I'm going to spend

26:10.635 --> 26:14.044
the rest of my life
worrying about you,

26:14.973 --> 26:16.323
and caring for you.

26:21.813 --> 26:23.890
Whether either one
of us likes it or not.

30:08.873 --> 30:10.347
Hello?

30:16.114 --> 30:17.464
Hello?

30:24.522 --> 30:26.099
Hello?

30:27.125 --> 30:28.475
Hello?

30:31.896 --> 30:33.246
Hello?

32:22.507 --> 32:24.186
Re-center,
and start again.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.040
God damn it!

32:40.525 --> 32:41.875
Re-center.

32:43.361 --> 32:44.711
And start again.

32:49.434 --> 32:50.908
Just leave me
alone for a minute.

32:54.372 --> 32:57.324
I'm worried that you're not
taking proper care of yourself.

33:00.211 --> 33:01.561
I'm fine.

33:03.514 --> 33:04.864
There's a difference in you.

33:07.018 --> 33:08.368
I'm getting better.

33:08.486 --> 33:09.836
Of course you are.

33:10.488 --> 33:11.838
And I know it can't be easy.

33:13.624 --> 33:14.974
You don't know anything.

33:17.562 --> 33:19.466
I just want what's
best for you, little girl.

33:20.565 --> 33:22.532
You just want...

33:22.533 --> 33:23.667
you just want.

33:23.668 --> 33:25.018
Calm down.

33:26.237 --> 33:27.587
I'm right here with you.

33:29.540 --> 33:30.890
You're not my mother.

33:32.176 --> 33:33.787
You're the fucking house keeper.

33:36.247 --> 33:37.633
Now you're just being hateful.

33:40.485 --> 33:41.835
That's because I hate you.

33:52.196 --> 33:54.297
Little girls, and little girls,

33:54.298 --> 33:55.648
and...

33:57.235 --> 33:58.468
I don't know why
you put yourself

33:58.469 --> 33:59.703
through this.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.054
Little girls.

34:01.806 --> 34:03.106
You don't remember?

34:03.107 --> 34:04.718
This is how it starts.

34:04.776 --> 34:07.411
Little girls, little girls,

34:07.412 --> 34:09.558
little girls are all
fucking hateful.

34:21.426 --> 34:23.036
This is what you want?

34:23.127 --> 34:25.795
You get this way and you
don't leave me many choices.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.498
What I'm suppose to
do now is call the police.

34:28.498 --> 34:30.534
Do you know what
will happen then?

34:30.534 --> 34:32.976
Do you remember?

34:33.071 --> 34:35.806
You wouldn't rather stay here?

34:35.806 --> 34:37.157
In your home.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.592
Where people love you.

34:42.447 --> 34:43.920
We've come to close
to losing you.

34:45.483 --> 34:46.833
Too many times.

34:48.386 --> 34:49.893
From your first moment till now.

34:52.723 --> 34:56.699
I've seen every version of you.

34:59.497 --> 35:00.869
You can be well if you want to.

35:09.507 --> 35:10.857
That's it.

35:12.577 --> 35:13.927
Come here.

35:15.513 --> 35:16.863
Come to me.

35:36.234 --> 35:37.584
Stop fighting.

35:50.181 --> 35:51.883
You know how to make it stop.

35:52.450 --> 35:54.132
But you need to give
yourself permission.

36:25.716 --> 36:27.088
Shut up, bitch.

36:27.418 --> 36:28.768
Shut the fuck up.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.766
Shut up.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.190
I'll cut your god damn
cunt open.

36:44.235 --> 36:46.142
Is that what you like?
Huh?

36:46.237 --> 36:47.848
Come here.

36:47.939 --> 36:50.874
That's what you like.

36:50.875 --> 36:53.578
Here you go.

36:53.878 --> 36:55.523
I'm gonna beat you bad.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.564
Hurt you.

36:57.648 --> 36:58.998
Sun choke.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.261
Now clean this mess up.

38:23.601 --> 38:24.951
Shit.

38:50.895 --> 38:52.281
I mean, nothing's been stolen,

38:52.363 --> 38:54.304
but someone has
definitely been in my house.

38:54.799 --> 38:56.766
No one's in the house now?

38:56.767 --> 38:59.436
I mean, you can't really see
now, but this was foggy.

38:59.437 --> 39:01.008
Like someone had been
using my shower.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.430
What's out that door?

39:11.482 --> 39:12.832
It's a balcony.

39:29.900 --> 39:33.013
Well, I think the
place is clear.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.807
Let's go, I'll get your report down,

39:37.808 --> 39:41.345
and figure out the best way to proceed
to ensure that this doesn't happen again.

39:42.913 --> 39:44.263
Okay.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.180
Can I help you?

45:15.913 --> 45:17.980
Settle down.

45:17.981 --> 45:19.331
Settle down!

45:28.325 --> 45:30.493
Because you've proven
you can't be trusted,

45:30.494 --> 45:35.570
because you choose to trample
all over the rules you agreed to.

45:37.768 --> 45:39.970
The collar you're wearing
was designed for a dog,

45:41.071 --> 45:42.901
because that's how
you force me to treat you.

45:44.908 --> 45:48.746
If you go beyond a certain
perimeter around the house,

45:49.497 --> 45:51.040
you get a shock.

45:51.515 --> 45:53.592
It's simple enough for
a dog to understand,

45:55.219 --> 45:57.012
but you can test it
if you don't believe me.

46:00.224 --> 46:02.097
There are three levels.

46:02.860 --> 46:04.210
One.

46:12.035 --> 46:13.385
Two.

46:17.908 --> 46:19.258
Please stop.

46:23.147 --> 46:25.764
If you go beyond the boundary,
it's straight to three.

46:26.316 --> 46:28.072
Would you like to
see what that feels like?

46:36.493 --> 46:38.331
Your father is going to
be so disappointed.

46:44.802 --> 46:46.345
You let me talk to him.

46:48.438 --> 46:49.788
Then we'll see.

46:54.578 --> 46:56.257
You need to get well, little girl.

47:00.984 --> 47:02.334
Now where were you?

47:07.925 --> 47:09.275
Nowhere.

47:09.993 --> 47:12.139
Where were you
and who were you with?

47:14.998 --> 47:16.348
Nobody.

47:18.268 --> 47:19.618
I saw you.

47:20.370 --> 47:21.720
I know what this is about.

47:23.473 --> 47:25.778
Do you really want
to risk everything

47:25.876 --> 47:28.579
we've accomplished
in this last year?

47:31.849 --> 47:36.657
Are you so desperate
to destroy yourself?

47:38.956 --> 47:40.306
It's not what you think.

47:48.065 --> 47:49.415
We'll see.

47:51.468 --> 47:52.818
Sit.

48:03.947 --> 48:06.127
Don't make this any
harder then it already is.

48:26.169 --> 48:27.519
And...

50:00.497 --> 50:01.883
This will make you feel better.

50:37.801 --> 50:42.006
Be the reflection of the
moon over the water.

50:43.673 --> 50:45.023
The moon doesn't get wet.

50:46.109 --> 50:48.789
And the water is never broken.

50:51.615 --> 50:53.465
For all it's vastness,

50:53.583 --> 50:59.671
the moon and the entire sky
can be reflected in a puddle.

51:01.124 --> 51:04.000
Even in a drop of water.

51:06.530 --> 51:08.280
When you cease to be the water,

51:08.732 --> 51:10.482
and become the reflection.

51:11.802 --> 51:15.439
You begin to fully realize

51:15.731 --> 51:21.553
the limitlessness
of the light in the sky.

53:18.495 --> 53:20.045
What's going on in here?

53:20.730 --> 53:22.080
What are you doing?

53:24.768 --> 53:26.118
Nothing.

53:29.406 --> 53:30.866
Come here and let
me look at you.

53:36.279 --> 53:37.856
Tricky, tricky.

53:37.914 --> 53:39.264
You've been busy.

53:40.483 --> 53:41.833
I didn't.

53:42.686 --> 53:44.036
Where's your toy then?

53:44.421 --> 53:45.771
Where are you hiding it?

53:55.765 --> 53:58.946
All right, you've had your fun.

54:00.470 --> 54:01.820
Now give those to me.

54:04.474 --> 54:08.377
You use to do the same thing
when you were a baby.

54:08.378 --> 54:11.013
If you thought
something was yours,

54:11.014 --> 54:12.750
you wouldn't give it
up for anything.

54:17.854 --> 54:21.866
You are entitled to
absolutely nothing.

54:23.393 --> 54:26.005
The only thing standing
between you and the abyss,

54:26.796 --> 54:28.566
is how much I love you.

54:30.900 --> 54:33.774
You know what happens when
we run out of options.

55:04.701 --> 55:06.272
You think this is the
end of anything?

55:07.504 --> 55:10.150
You think it'll be
any different once I'm gone?

55:13.843 --> 55:16.080
Who would you be without me?

57:14.831 --> 57:16.165
My god, what happened?

57:16.166 --> 57:17.516
Are you okay?

57:20.437 --> 57:21.670
Jesus, Ma...

57:21.671 --> 57:23.021
Margo?

57:25.809 --> 57:27.159
Do you remember me?

57:34.083 --> 57:35.433
Can I take you home?

58:05.248 --> 58:06.927
I can come inside,

58:07.917 --> 58:09.267
if you don't want to be alone.

58:42.252 --> 58:43.685
What is this?

58:43.686 --> 58:45.297
What are you doing?

58:46.656 --> 58:48.164
Margo, please...

58:50.527 --> 58:53.503
Why are you doing this?

58:56.833 --> 58:58.410
I was just trying to help you.

59:01.905 --> 59:03.255
Stop.

59:18.054 --> 59:21.827
Margo, please.

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:21.524
Good morning, little girl.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.639
Good morning.

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:05.226
Please, I don't want it.

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:23.121
Please.

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:42.207
I need to go to the bathroom.

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:33.178
Will you just tell me what
I need to do to make this stop.

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:35.944
Please.

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:38.716
Just tell me what
I did and I'll fix it.

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:51.092
What are you gonna do when
people find out about this?

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:52.294
Huh?

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:54.600
What are you gonna do?

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:38.175
Don't, please.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:25.370
Please.

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:30.437
Please.

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:51.589
You can look at me, you know.

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:55.860
You could talk to me.

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:01.961
I think I understand what you want.

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:06.893
And if it's going to make things okay,
then I want to give it to you.

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:12.330
But you have to look at me.

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:26.891
You have to come closer.

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:33.398
Closer.

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:36.734
Closer.

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:00.825
What?

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:24.959
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:29.777
Fucking say something to me!

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:36.644
All right.
We're almost done.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:37.995
Do you need the paper?

01:08:38.613 --> 01:08:39.964
No.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.133
I can do it.

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:45.057
Good. Lets begin.

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:47.755
- In futurity...
- Prophecy.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:50.060
- That the earth from...
- Sleep.

01:08:50.158 --> 01:08:52.260
- Grade the sentence.
- Deep.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.696
- Shall arise and...
- Seek.

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:56.798
- From her maker...
- Meek.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:58.408
And the desert wild...

01:08:58.408 --> 01:09:01.446
Become a garden mild.

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:03.770
I'm going to give you a word.

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:05.747
And I'd like you to
repeat it back to me.

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:08.192
Caterpillar.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.500
Matchbook.

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:20.063
I read a poem
that reminded me of you.

01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:24.551
Can you ask me the
name of the poem?

01:09:28.363 --> 01:09:29.714
Ask me the name.

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:31.666
You fucking asshole!

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:32.901
You motherfuh...

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:36.848
I fucking hate this stupid,
motherfucking shit.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:40.308
Now stand.

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:42.546
Raise your right arm.

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:46.693
Now walk with me.

01:09:51.386 --> 01:09:53.965
Put your right hand on the wall.

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:58.898
Hit the wall with your forehead.

01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:03.671
You are better at
throwing a javelin,

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:05.736
discus and shotput.

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:09.412
I am the better swimmer.

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:12.817
You are better with people.

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:15.715
You are taller.

01:10:17.413 --> 01:10:18.887
You are better looking.

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:22.692
You are better looking.

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:25.703
Our names are different.

01:10:27.523 --> 01:10:29.430
Our faces are different.

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:34.701
I like to talk about what it's like
at the bottom of the cliff.

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:39.206
I like to talk about to talk
about what it's like on the way down.

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.170
I was a breech birth.

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:38.638
I came out the wrong way.

01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:47.084
My mother's cervix wasn't dilated
enough for my head to pass through.

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:50.655
So I got stuck.

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:56.761
She wouldn't let me go.

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:05.187
Like she knew what would
happen when she did.

01:12:08.023 --> 01:12:10.829
She died less than
an hour after I was born.

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:17.014
I killed her.

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:22.181
I wonder sometimes
if I meant to.

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:26.651
Or would it...

01:12:27.843 --> 01:12:29.920
How it would've
been if it was me.

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:35.032
But I know now,

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:40.130
that I'm still here
because of you.

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:45.637
I had to be here for
you to find me.

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:50.081
No.

01:12:51.467 --> 01:12:53.806
I know what a difficult
position you're in.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.846
I know you're afraid.

01:13:01.977 --> 01:13:04.545
You didn't want or...

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:06.817
expect things to
turn out this way.

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.820
But I want to know you too.

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:18.262
I know you imagined a thousand versions
of us before you finally found me.

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:23.674
There's a void in me,

01:13:25.668 --> 01:13:28.002
that I know exists in you too.

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:31.922
An empty space.

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:35.787
Where we both belong.

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:46.203
Margo.

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:54.902
Mar Go, please!

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:01.552
Janie, please.

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.288
Janie?

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.890
Is that your real name?

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:08.919
Sun choke.

01:15:09.305 --> 01:15:15.643
