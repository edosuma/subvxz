00:02.089 --> 00:03.655
Previously onLegacies...ALARIC:
Landon took a knife.

00:03.699 --> 00:05.614
Now monsters
that shouldn't exist have been

00:05.657 --> 00:07.224
coming after it ever since.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.747
CLARKE:
You've been consumed
by Malivore?

00:08.791 --> 00:10.880
All your friends
have forgotten

00:10.923 --> 00:13.100
you ever existed.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.231
HOPE:
Malivore doesn't want me here.

00:14.275 --> 00:15.841
Good luck, Clarke!

00:15.885 --> 00:17.104
You told me that
the monster attacks had stopped,

00:17.147 --> 00:18.235
and then, right when I show up,

00:18.279 --> 00:20.281
things start happening again?

00:21.325 --> 00:22.239
I'm pretty sure I'm the reason.

00:22.283 --> 00:23.762
I know you don't
remember this.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.851
You're the closest thing
I have to a father now.

00:25.895 --> 00:28.680
It's okay.
We'll figure it out together.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.073
LANDON:
I know you're in there, Raf.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.683
We're gonna find a way
to get you back,

00:31.727 --> 00:33.076
and then everything will be
good again, okay?

00:33.120 --> 00:35.078
The longer he's a wolf,
the less human he'll be.

00:35.122 --> 00:38.081
And at what point does a wolf no
longer need a human best friend?

00:38.125 --> 00:40.649
Maybe he moved on, 'cause
he saw that you have someone

00:40.692 --> 00:41.954
who can help you be

00:41.998 --> 00:43.260
happy.

00:44.348 --> 00:45.915
Rough night?Yeah, actually.

00:45.958 --> 00:47.917
Uh, relationship trouble.
Fell for a guy

00:47.960 --> 00:49.092
who doesn't even
know that I exist.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.920
Uh, you must be new.
I thought I knew all

00:50.963 --> 00:52.313
of the incoming students.

00:52.356 --> 00:54.315
Oh, this is a
school of some kind?

00:54.358 --> 00:56.099
Wait. What's your name?Sebastian.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.928
I'm Lizzie.It's good to meet
you, Elizabeth.

00:58.971 --> 01:01.583
DORIAN:
The faculty are waiting to
meet you, Professor Vardemus.

01:01.626 --> 01:03.324
Call me "Headmaster."

01:03.367 --> 01:05.804
I saw that little spell
you cast on your classmate.

01:05.848 --> 01:07.806
Offensive magic is a tool
that has its place.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.895
I'm creating a new
magic curriculum

01:09.939 --> 01:12.594
for advanced students.
I'd like you to be the first.

01:16.641 --> 01:18.469
♪ Ooh, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ooh

01:18.513 --> 01:19.818
♪ Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ooh

01:19.862 --> 01:21.820
♪ Ah-ah-ah,
ah-ah, ah-ah ♪

01:21.864 --> 01:24.127
♪ Ah, ah-ah-ah,

01:24.171 --> 01:26.912
♪ Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ooh,

01:26.956 --> 01:29.915
♪ Ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah,
ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ha... ♪

01:29.959 --> 01:32.353
All right boys, let's do this.

01:32.396 --> 01:34.355
And don't screw up the spelling
this year.

01:34.398 --> 01:35.704
There's one "I" in dick.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.053
Probably should be a you.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.492
Was that an insult?

01:41.536 --> 01:42.972
I don't know, Dennis.

01:43.015 --> 01:44.321
Let me know when
you figure it out.

01:44.365 --> 01:45.627
Why are we doing this?

01:45.670 --> 01:47.846
DENNIS:
Because we always do.

01:47.890 --> 01:49.848
We vandalize
the Salvatore School every year.

01:49.892 --> 01:51.154
It's tradition.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.330
So is the electoral college.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.550
Never heard of 'em.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.639
Football team must suck.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.559
What are y'all waiting for?

02:04.602 --> 02:06.387
I told you what to do.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.389
Last I checked,
QB calls the plays.

02:08.432 --> 02:09.868
I say we go home.

02:09.912 --> 02:11.348
The last I checked,
I've been starting

02:11.392 --> 02:13.350
at linebacker
for four years now.

02:13.394 --> 02:14.873
And you're only our quarterback

02:14.917 --> 02:16.397
because Connor transferred
or something.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.399
Not the only reason.

02:18.442 --> 02:21.184
God also put a thunderbolt
in my right arm.

02:21.228 --> 02:24.883
So let's just go
before you experience it.

02:26.450 --> 02:28.191
It's my truck,

02:28.235 --> 02:29.888
and I ain't going anywhere.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.892
So do what
you got to do, Thor.

02:40.464 --> 02:42.597
Nice night for a walk, anyway.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.425
Good luck with the spelling,
Dennis.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.081
Hey, where are you two going?

02:50.605 --> 02:52.607
Pansies.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.972
Night won't be a waste
if I can bag a wolf.

03:29.992 --> 03:32.603
HOPE:
They say that it's better
to have loved and lost

03:32.647 --> 03:36.477
than never
to have loved at all.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.261
Whoever wrote that
clearly never experienced

03:38.305 --> 03:39.523
the love of their life

03:39.567 --> 03:41.264
forgetting
their whole existence.

03:41.308 --> 03:45.137
It makes you want
to be alone,

03:45.181 --> 03:46.704
because you can't lose
what you never had.

03:46.748 --> 03:48.315
YOUNG MAN:
Come on, let's go!

04:03.678 --> 04:06.202
This looks
pretty self-explanatory,

04:06.246 --> 04:07.943
but you want to give it a shot?

04:07.986 --> 04:12.861
Um, toxic masculinity mixed
with outdated sports pranks?

04:14.341 --> 04:16.125
There's no way Hope did it.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.344
She's a Timberwolf,
not a Stallion.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.215
Maya? What happened?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.869
Oh, don't worry.
She's my mom.

04:23.045 --> 04:25.177
We don't really like
to talk about it.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.701
We?

04:26.744 --> 04:29.312
Hey, Hope.
Ethan?

04:29.356 --> 04:31.575
So you guys are...?

04:31.619 --> 04:34.404
My kids, no matter
how much it embarrasses them.

04:34.448 --> 04:35.710
'Cause who doesn't like
getting dropped off

04:35.753 --> 04:37.320
to school in a cop car?

04:37.364 --> 04:39.322
I'm on official business.

04:40.932 --> 04:46.373
Now... show me where
I can find Principal Saltzman.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.377
Yeah, sorry, I...
I haven't seen him.

04:50.420 --> 04:54.206
Like I said,
I'm pretty new here.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.121
Well, his teammates last saw him

04:56.165 --> 04:58.036
at the Old Mill,
by the Salvatore School.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.475
We found his truck abandoned,
and his hunting rifle nearby.

05:01.518 --> 05:05.000
Okay. Well, I will check with
his classmates and his teachers.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.741
I wish I could be more helpful,
but like I said,

05:06.784 --> 05:09.570
I'm still getting to know
the students.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.223
And the sheriff.

05:12.877 --> 05:15.706
I was friends with the old one.

05:15.750 --> 05:19.493
Please, no more stories about
how great Sheriff Donovan was.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.538
His shoes are
already big enough.

05:21.582 --> 05:24.454
And this is my first real case
since I moved from the city.

05:24.498 --> 05:27.022
Truthfully, I didn't mind
that my biggest concern

05:27.065 --> 05:29.894
up to this point was
a rash of missing dogs.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.420
Maybe they're connected.

05:33.463 --> 05:36.074
Maybe.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.601
I'll leave you my phone number.

05:40.644 --> 05:43.038
Call me anytime.

05:46.911 --> 05:49.131
Did you get all that?

05:50.262 --> 05:51.568
Yeah.

05:51.612 --> 05:54.049
She's definitely into you.
What?

05:54.092 --> 05:58.619
No. No, she's just new to town,
trying to make friends.

05:58.662 --> 06:01.230
Which is exactly what
you need to be doing.

06:01.273 --> 06:02.449
Yeah, well,
tried that last year.

06:02.492 --> 06:03.972
Didn't really work out.

06:04.015 --> 06:07.062
So I'm gonna focus
on monster slaying.

06:07.105 --> 06:08.629
Well, it sounds like there
could be another monster

06:08.672 --> 06:10.326
lurking around
the Salvatore School.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.241
So I'll check
in with Dorian,

06:12.284 --> 06:14.461
since he has access
to research we don't.

06:14.504 --> 06:15.853
Any other ideas?

06:15.897 --> 06:18.639
Just one, but, uh...

06:18.682 --> 06:20.684
we are both going to hate it.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.210
VARDEMUS:
As you are well aware,

06:25.254 --> 06:27.474
it's time for the annual
American football match

06:27.517 --> 06:29.476
with Mystic Falls High.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.826
Great.

06:31.869 --> 06:36.308
Today, you will not be forced
to lose a game

06:36.352 --> 06:39.486
so that humans can
feel superior.

06:39.529 --> 06:42.576
Every one of you is special.

06:42.619 --> 06:45.448
Every one of you.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.319
And it's time you showed it.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.500
How?

06:53.543 --> 06:56.677
By using your powers
in moderation, Ms. Saltzman.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.157
The goal is not exposure,

06:59.201 --> 07:00.681
merely to win.

07:00.724 --> 07:03.727
Think of it as
an exercise in control.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.729
Well, I am here for it.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.514
After last year,
it'll feel really good

07:07.557 --> 07:09.472
to show those Timberwolves
what we're all about.

07:09.516 --> 07:10.865
Right?

07:10.908 --> 07:14.346
And who better to lead you
in this endeavor,

07:14.390 --> 07:16.261
as your quarterback,

07:16.305 --> 07:18.350
than our own Landon Kirby?

07:29.710 --> 07:31.668
We have an emergency.

07:31.712 --> 07:34.976
Headmaster Vardemus wants
Landonto play QB.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.325
Cool.

07:36.368 --> 07:38.066
Cool? That's your slot.

07:38.109 --> 07:41.330
I'm hunting bigger game
this year.

07:41.373 --> 07:43.593
That Sebastian dude
you're crushing on?

07:43.637 --> 07:45.900
What if he's not
a dudeat all?

07:45.943 --> 07:47.684
I was thinking about it
last night.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.556
Him just showing up
the way he did

07:49.599 --> 07:51.340
was super fishy.

07:51.383 --> 07:54.430
Given the events
of our last school year...

07:55.431 --> 07:57.520
Compendium Monstrum?

07:57.564 --> 07:59.217
You think he's a monster?

07:59.261 --> 08:02.351
I'm thinking
I can't rule it out.

08:02.394 --> 08:05.528
So, sorry, but this is way
more important than football.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.008
Even though I'm
awesome at it.

08:07.051 --> 08:09.706
Well... Landon pulled
his groin

08:09.750 --> 08:10.751
combing his hair once.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.230
We need you at that game.

08:12.274 --> 08:15.625
MG, I am mentally healthy
for perhaps

08:15.669 --> 08:18.410
the first time in my life,
and ready for romance.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.761
I'm hoping that
Sebastian pans out.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.545
But if he doesn't,
I need to set my sights

08:22.589 --> 08:23.764
on someone else.

08:23.807 --> 08:26.244
Like, uh...  ...who?

08:26.288 --> 08:28.682
The first person that asks.

08:28.725 --> 08:31.293
It's the year of yes. Remember?

08:34.470 --> 08:36.341
Well, in that case,
two sets of eyes

08:36.385 --> 08:38.213
are better than one,
especially when one of them

08:38.256 --> 08:40.476
can vamp-read,
so come to the game.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.565
I'll help you hit the books,
and we can figure out who

08:42.609 --> 08:45.046
and what this guy really is.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.787
Part of me is worried about
what we might find out.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.745
You're supposed to say yes.
Remember?

08:48.789 --> 08:50.704
Fine. Yes.

08:50.747 --> 08:55.535
Guess I better go dig up
that trash bag of a jersey.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.277
LANDON:
Yellow 80.

08:59.321 --> 09:00.714
Yellow 80...

09:00.757 --> 09:03.064
Sorry.

09:03.107 --> 09:05.762
Foster care didn't have
a football team.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.764
What did I tell you?
I'm a total fraud.

09:07.808 --> 09:08.809
Now the whole school's
gonna see it, and...

09:08.852 --> 09:10.158
this is a total disaster.

09:10.201 --> 09:11.681
And like I told you,

09:11.725 --> 09:13.248
I'm really good at
taking care of people.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.945
We're gonna get through this.How?

09:14.989 --> 09:16.686
I can't even throw.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.079
Yes, you can.

09:18.122 --> 09:19.515
You just need a little help.

09:25.303 --> 09:28.002
Viribus.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.656
What'd you just do?

09:32.354 --> 09:33.660
See for yourself.

09:48.892 --> 09:51.547
GUY:
Kaleb!

09:54.289 --> 09:56.639
Damn!

09:56.683 --> 09:57.684
That's my quarterback.

10:13.961 --> 10:17.007
♪ Call me dirt
or call me diamonds ♪

10:17.051 --> 10:20.228
♪ Call me crass
or call me cruel ♪

10:20.271 --> 10:22.317
♪ Call me daddy... Do you know that girl?

10:22.360 --> 10:25.450
Not really.

10:25.494 --> 10:28.149
We just, uh...

10:28.192 --> 10:30.717
shared a milkshake once.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.719
Let's just get this over with
as fast as possible.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.111
Works for me.
I'm no more comfortable

10:34.155 --> 10:35.678
being here than you are.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.724
Ric...

10:37.767 --> 10:40.422
There's something that
you need to see.

10:45.732 --> 10:48.125
Let us begin
our annual rite

10:48.169 --> 10:50.345
of American excess.

10:50.388 --> 10:52.782
But unlike last year,

10:52.826 --> 10:55.350
I expect no unseemly violence,
only for each team

10:55.393 --> 10:59.267
to play to the fullest extent
of their abilities.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.704
Understood?

11:01.748 --> 11:03.575
Timberwolves of Mystic Falls,

11:03.619 --> 11:05.839
you may,

11:05.882 --> 11:08.406
as I believe they say,

11:08.450 --> 11:10.017
call it in the air.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.107
Heads.

11:17.198 --> 11:19.504
Tails never fails.We'll take the ball.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.376
So it begins.

11:21.419 --> 11:23.421
Uh, shake hands.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.301
Having another
milkshake moment?

11:33.344 --> 11:35.695
Sorry.

11:57.151 --> 11:58.761
We found him wandering
the woods,

11:58.805 --> 12:00.241
half out of his mind.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.634
He didn't settle down
until we compelled him.

12:06.856 --> 12:08.336
Does he remember anything?

12:08.379 --> 12:09.859
Tell him what you saw, Dennis.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.036
It was some kind of animal.

12:13.080 --> 12:17.127
Like a-a hyena
mixed with a wolf,

12:17.171 --> 12:18.781
with huge claws.

12:18.825 --> 12:19.956
It grabbed me.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.785
I thought it was gonna eat me,

12:22.829 --> 12:25.048
but then it spit me out.

12:25.092 --> 12:26.963
Hmm.

12:27.007 --> 12:28.486
Does that ring any bells?

12:28.530 --> 12:32.708
Closest thing I could find
was a Shunka Warakin.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.798
Until this morning,
it was a Native American myth.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.670
Roughly translated, it means
"carrying off dogs."

12:38.714 --> 12:41.499
Lucky for Dennis,
according to Ioway legend,

12:41.543 --> 12:43.893
all it eats are werewolves.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.810
ALARIC:
Dorian found the missing kid.

12:47.854 --> 12:48.898
Thank God he's okay.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.465
But we definitely have
another monster

12:50.508 --> 12:51.901
wandering around these woods.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.903
Dorian's digging into
the research,

12:53.947 --> 12:55.252
but he thinks it's a Shunka.

12:55.296 --> 12:57.037
What's...
And before you ask
what that is,

12:57.080 --> 12:59.866
it's a carnivorous creature
that feeds only on werewolves.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.824
Good thing it's not
a full moon.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.826
Yeah, except Raf has been
stuck in wolf form

13:03.870 --> 13:05.045
ever since you've been gone.

13:05.088 --> 13:06.611
Wait, Raf?

13:06.655 --> 13:08.048
I didn't even know
that he turned.Yeah.

13:08.091 --> 13:09.397
Happened fighting Triad.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.702
Hasn't been able
to turn back since.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.008
Yeah, of course
he can't turn back.

13:12.052 --> 13:13.488
I'm the only one
that can turn him back.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.011
I'm the one that gave him
that crescent moon ring.

13:15.055 --> 13:18.058
Okay, look,
I've got to go find him

13:18.101 --> 13:20.495
before the Shunka
finds him first.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.478

Agreed. We just need
to find a way

14:16.116 --> 14:17.117
to ditch this game.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.119
No. Rafael is my responsibility.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.729

and keep an eye

Because he already
used magic to cheat.

We're screwed.

14:47.451 --> 14:49.366
Hey, it was just one score.

14:49.410 --> 14:50.933
And you're gonna march us
straight down that field

14:50.977 --> 14:52.282
and tie us up.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.328
What do you mean?
Your brother's the quarterback.

14:54.371 --> 14:55.851
No, not today.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.157

Oh...

15:06.557 --> 15:08.168
Did you see that block?

15:08.211 --> 15:10.779

and sprung that play,

15:10.822 --> 15:13.347
in a respectful way.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.871
Sorry, too busy figuring out

guys, let's do this.

What was that all about?

Josie.
I hurt her.

17:59.382 --> 18:02.298
No, you didn't, she's fine.
She was clearly faking.

18:02.342 --> 18:04.300
Why would she fake

Well, you're not a human,
you're a phoenix.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.613
This is a game
where there are sides.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.136
Plus, I mean, there's
something off about her.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.138
I just-- I don't know what,
but there's something.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.140
Yeah, she's not the only one.

19:57.108 --> 20:01.243
Uh... look, I know
that this looks bad...
No.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.680
It looks like magic.

20:07.989 --> 20:10.470
Corporis impetus!

20:12.211 --> 20:14.648
I'm starting to think you're
not some ordinary girl.

20:14.691 --> 20:17.128
Look, my name is Hope, okay?

20:17.172 --> 20:18.608
I-I'm a witch.

20:18.652 --> 20:20.262
I'm working with Dr. Saltzman.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.264
He asked me to do a locater
spell to find Rafael.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.918
Why wouldn't he ask
one of his own daughters?

20:23.961 --> 20:25.311
Because they don't know
about the Crescent Wolf Clan.

20:25.354 --> 20:26.486
Not like I do.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.357
Wol-- I-I've read about that.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.880
Does that mean you can
turn Raf back?

20:30.881 --> 20:32.231
Saeclum.

20:34.972 --> 20:38.062
There is a monster in the woods,
and it feeds on werewolves.

20:38.106 --> 20:39.499
Ooh. Then I'm coming with you.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.457
Sorry, but I fly solo.

20:41.501 --> 20:42.632
Uh...

20:42.676 --> 20:44.286
He's my best friend.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.070
You do realize I could
freeze you again, right?

20:46.114 --> 20:47.942
Would that spell last forever?

20:55.254 --> 20:57.256
Just try to keep up.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.998
Okay, okay, Stallions,
I see you.

21:01.042 --> 21:02.739
That's what I'm talking about.Nice job, guys.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.175
Good half. Now,

21:04.219 --> 21:05.481
we can take it easy.

21:05.525 --> 21:07.178
This game is done and dusted.

21:07.222 --> 21:09.311
Hey.No, it's not.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.313
We need to score more.KALEB:
We're up

21:11.357 --> 21:13.533
35-7, Jo.
No reason to rub it in.

21:13.576 --> 21:15.317
I mean, it sounded
cool and all,

21:15.361 --> 21:18.364
sticking it to the townies,
but now it feels wrong.

21:18.407 --> 21:20.453
I don't think we need to use
our powers in the second half.

21:20.496 --> 21:21.802
What? Why not?

21:21.845 --> 21:23.804
Because your dad was right

21:23.847 --> 21:25.501
about the way the game
should be played.

21:25.545 --> 21:27.329
He was right about
a lot of things.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.679
But you already know
how I feel about that subject.

21:29.723 --> 21:32.421
So, I'm guessing you don't want
to play quarterback, then?

21:32.465 --> 21:34.771
Mm-mm.

21:34.815 --> 21:37.513
Because I don't think
that Landon's coming back.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.341
Someone needs
to step up.

21:39.385 --> 21:41.909
You serious?

21:41.952 --> 21:44.215
I'll do it.

21:45.434 --> 21:49.220
No offense, Wade, but no.

21:50.526 --> 21:53.486
If we're not gonna
use our powers,

21:53.529 --> 21:55.401
we need the old magic back.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.187
Pass.

21:59.230 --> 22:00.493
VARDEMUS:
Enough leisure.

22:00.536 --> 22:04.671
Get back out there
and showcase your superiority.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.544
Dad.

22:08.588 --> 22:10.241
Hi, girls, uh,

22:10.285 --> 22:13.549
I just need a moment
with your headmaster.

22:13.593 --> 22:14.855
Hey.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.077
What is it, Coach?

22:20.121 --> 22:21.514
It's Principal Saltzman.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.559
I'm well aware
of who you are, Dr. Saltzman.

22:23.603 --> 22:25.387
In fact, you being
who you are

22:25.431 --> 22:28.172
is why I have your old job.

22:28.216 --> 22:31.393
Mm. I know what you're doing.
You're embarrassing my kids.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.482
Now ease up in the second half.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.397
Did you ever occur to you
that my kids

22:35.441 --> 22:37.181
are simply superior to yours?

22:37.225 --> 22:39.096
Of course they are.
And it's obvious

22:39.140 --> 22:41.621
they're using their magic,
and it isn't fair.

22:41.664 --> 22:43.884
The only people to whom
that's obvious are you and me,

22:43.927 --> 22:46.669
so I don't see the problem.

22:46.713 --> 22:49.585
And to be clear,
what wasn't fair

22:49.629 --> 22:53.589
was you stifling their abilities
all these years.

22:53.633 --> 22:55.417
I was trying to protect them.

22:55.461 --> 22:56.592
How did that work out?

22:58.464 --> 23:00.640
What the hell is your deal? Hmm?

23:00.683 --> 23:02.555
Forget about football.

23:02.598 --> 23:04.557
What game are you
really playing?

23:04.600 --> 23:06.602
Best of luck, Coach.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.824
I anticipate you'll need it.

23:18.919 --> 23:21.617
Some good news, Dorian?

23:21.661 --> 23:23.358
Maybe next year
I can coach the game

23:23.402 --> 23:25.012
and you can do
the monster research.

23:25.055 --> 23:26.796
In the meantime, here's
that good news you asked for.

23:26.840 --> 23:30.670
So, killing a Shunka is pretty
much like killing anything else.

23:30.713 --> 23:32.628
You want to go for the heart,
the throat or the brain.

23:32.672 --> 23:35.326
Sounds easy enough.Kind of. It's bigger

23:35.370 --> 23:36.632
than I thought.

23:36.676 --> 23:37.938
How big?

23:37.981 --> 23:39.896
About the size of your truck.

23:39.940 --> 23:42.072
And the hide's thick, too,

23:42.116 --> 23:44.292
so probably easiest
to get it from the back.

23:44.335 --> 23:45.554
Good to know.

23:45.598 --> 23:47.382
Anything else?Yeah, I found

23:47.426 --> 23:50.820
this one weird reference
that says it cries like a man.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.605
Not sure what that means.

23:52.648 --> 23:55.564
Well, hopefully it'll be dead
before we find out.

23:55.608 --> 23:57.392
I'll let Hope know.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.395
HOPE:
Yeah, Raf should be up ahead.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.050
Cool.Meaning not cool?

24:03.093 --> 24:05.531
Sorry. It's just...

24:05.574 --> 24:07.663
nothing.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.317
Meaning something.

24:09.360 --> 24:13.539
It's stupid, but when Raf
was first stuck as a wolf,

24:13.582 --> 24:16.063
he used to always hang out
with me, but then he, like,

24:16.106 --> 24:17.368
he stopped.

24:17.412 --> 24:18.631
Like, he forgot or he moved on.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.676
And you're worried

24:20.720 --> 24:22.765
that it's gonna be the same
when he's human again?

24:22.809 --> 24:25.072
Told you it was stupid.

24:25.115 --> 24:27.161
I don't think it's stupid.

24:28.728 --> 24:31.905
It's painful to lose
someone that you love.

24:31.948 --> 24:33.515
Yeah.

24:33.559 --> 24:34.908
Oh, I know all about that.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.649
I grew up in the foster system.

24:36.692 --> 24:39.913
Getting bounced around from
family to family made me want

24:39.956 --> 24:41.697
to shut everybody out until
I realized life's a lot harder

24:41.741 --> 24:44.526
without someone
watching your back.

24:45.788 --> 24:47.311
Trust me, Landon,
you don't have to worry

24:47.355 --> 24:49.270
about anyone forgetting you.

24:50.793 --> 24:55.406
DENNIS' VOICE:
Help! Help! Somebody, help!

24:56.843 --> 25:00.237
Landon, wait, stay back.
You don't know what's out there!

25:05.199 --> 25:07.767
I have an educated guess.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.161
I said stay back.

25:11.205 --> 25:12.467
Incendia.

25:14.817 --> 25:16.210
Is there a plan "B"?

25:16.253 --> 25:17.559
Please tell me
there's a plan "B."

25:17.603 --> 25:18.908
Turn around.
Why?

25:18.952 --> 25:20.780
Because plan "B" involves me
getting naked.

25:20.823 --> 25:23.173
What?I have to draw it away from you.

25:23.217 --> 25:25.001
Why does that require nudity?

25:25.045 --> 25:27.482
Because this monster
feeds on werewolves.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.484
But you're a witch.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.312
A lying witch.

25:32.835 --> 25:34.750
A lying, very naked witch.

25:34.794 --> 25:36.404
Look, I'm more than that,
and I wish I could stay

25:36.447 --> 25:37.623
and tell you all about it,
but I can't.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.276
So when I draw this thing
away from you,

25:39.320 --> 25:40.800
I need you to go find
Dr. Saltzman and Raf.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.149
Why would it after chase you...

25:47.676 --> 25:50.853
Because you're a were-witch.
Holy smokes.

25:55.684 --> 25:58.557
Not the droids you're looking
for, so please move along.

26:03.910 --> 26:05.607
What are you guys doing?

26:05.651 --> 26:07.348
The second half's about to start
and we're down a QB.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.264
You want to throw a bit,
loosen up?

26:10.307 --> 26:12.614
I'd rather just leave now.
I mean, there's no way

26:12.658 --> 26:14.442
that I'm playing quarterback.Cool.

26:14.485 --> 26:16.052
'Cause I was thinking I would.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.099
I thought you were worried
about getting hurt.

26:20.883 --> 26:22.711
ETHAN:
The Stallions
need to worry.

26:22.755 --> 26:25.279
'Cause we're about
to take this ball

26:25.322 --> 26:26.802
and stick it in the end zone!

26:46.866 --> 26:48.781
Don't even ask.

26:48.824 --> 26:52.262
Okay, teenage Tom Brady
is killing us.

26:52.306 --> 26:54.830
So come ball out.
You at QB, me at wide receiver.

26:54.874 --> 26:56.179
Hooking up.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.226
In a purely athletic sense.

26:59.269 --> 27:02.272
Do I look pretty
when I play quarterback?

27:02.316 --> 27:03.926
Are you kidding me?

27:03.970 --> 27:06.668
You are the hottest thing
I've ever seen.

27:08.931 --> 27:10.890
Then put me in, Coach.

27:13.196 --> 27:16.243
Okay, since you guys can't seem
to stop Captain America

27:16.286 --> 27:18.680
or not fumble a kickoff,
our lead is bleeding

27:18.724 --> 27:19.725
like a stuck pig.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.857
But fear not.
I'm super absorbent.

27:21.901 --> 27:24.294
Wow. Uh, the hell's

we cannot go down this path.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.517

33:31.096 --> 33:33.881
