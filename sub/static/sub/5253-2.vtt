WEBVTT

00:01.688 --> 00:03.905
- This is a pretty epic prank.
- [all cheering]

00:03.930 --> 00:05.596
(Matty) Hats off, it's awesome.

00:05.598 --> 00:07.187
We really screwed up, Jake.

00:07.212 --> 00:09.233
It was my first time, and with you.

00:09.235 --> 00:11.336
(Jenna) Jake and Gabby
had cheated on Matty?

00:11.338 --> 00:13.037
Sadie, it's your mom.

00:13.039 --> 00:14.312
Hi, sweetheart.

00:15.133 --> 00:18.201
He was gonna break up with you.
He said he was still into Jenna.

00:18.226 --> 00:20.156
You know what, Matty? I [bleep] Jake.

00:21.132 --> 00:22.131
(all) Oh!

00:22.156 --> 00:23.590
Did you know?

00:25.468 --> 00:27.290
(Jenna) It was the
morning after Senior Prank,

00:27.315 --> 00:29.365
and what was once frothy, foamy fun

00:29.390 --> 00:31.799
in the decadent strobe
lights of reckless abandon

00:31.824 --> 00:34.750
was now sticky shame in the
fluorescent light of day.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.350
This is so disgusting.

00:36.352 --> 00:39.786
- Ugh, I hate cleaning.
- It makes everything pruny.

00:39.788 --> 00:41.255
Don't be such overachievers.

00:41.257 --> 00:42.989
We're responsible for a little foam,

00:42.991 --> 00:45.281
not 800 years of institutional filth.

00:45.306 --> 00:46.627
- Your turn.
- Oh, no,

00:46.629 --> 00:48.262
I don't do custodial.

00:48.264 --> 00:51.265
Poor Little Rich Bitch's
bitch mom comes back in town,

00:51.267 --> 00:52.799
and now she's too good for our ranks.

00:52.801 --> 00:54.390
Aw, so not true.

00:54.415 --> 00:57.082
I was always too good for your ranks.

00:57.338 --> 01:00.539
And don't call my mom a
bitch. It's disrespectful.

01:00.541 --> 01:02.742
[phone ringing]

01:02.744 --> 01:05.044
Darlene, if you want
to make yourself useful,

01:05.046 --> 01:07.703
get me out of this [bleep]
hole and take me to breakfast.

01:07.931 --> 01:09.206
See ya!

01:09.550 --> 01:12.451
Bonding with Moms. Sorry.

01:12.945 --> 01:13.703
Nice try.

01:13.750 --> 01:15.191
This is your doing.

01:15.193 --> 01:17.628
And you should be thanking
us, not oppressing us.

01:17.630 --> 01:18.762
Do you know how expensive

01:18.764 --> 01:20.296
foam machines and strobe lights are?

01:20.298 --> 01:22.506
If Theo hadn't stolen them
from that circuit party,

01:22.531 --> 01:24.731
our senior prank would be senior rank!

01:24.733 --> 01:27.492
What is in this foam? It sticks like glue.

01:27.523 --> 01:28.722
Rainbows, beer, and horse tranks.

01:28.724 --> 01:30.290
Were there stressed-out horsies?

01:30.292 --> 01:31.424
Not as many as there are here.

01:31.426 --> 01:32.660
(Jenna) Theo had a point.

01:32.662 --> 01:34.361
The ugliness between Matty and Jake,

01:34.363 --> 01:36.496
like the foam, had seeped
through the floorboards

01:36.498 --> 01:37.830
and into the morning.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.799
I felt bad for Jake, who had screwed up...

01:39.802 --> 01:41.669
and screwed over... his best friend.

01:41.670 --> 01:44.003
I felt worse for Matty,
who had been blindsided

01:44.005 --> 01:46.105
by his best friend and his girlfriend,

01:46.107 --> 01:48.374
which I had known about, and stayed out of.

01:48.376 --> 01:49.942
What is wrong with these people?

01:49.944 --> 01:52.011
I'm gonna need a
double-dose of "Dramamine"

01:52.013 --> 01:54.313
to deal with this overdose of dram-o-Rama.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.815
(Jenna) The "dram-o-Rama" had cast a pall

01:56.817 --> 01:59.785
over the best senior prank in PHHS history.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.920
Something had to be done.

02:01.922 --> 02:06.225
Hey, peeps, lighten up.
Only 46 days till graduation!

02:06.250 --> 02:08.031
Ew! Jenna!

02:08.919 --> 02:10.429
[gasps]

02:10.431 --> 02:11.530
What the...

02:11.532 --> 02:12.964
Oh.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.733
[screams]

02:14.735 --> 02:17.569
[students gasping and laughing]

02:17.571 --> 02:18.570
Jenna, I wouldn't...

02:18.572 --> 02:19.805
Oh, I would.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.139
Seriously, don't.

02:22.374 --> 02:23.842
[screams]

02:27.279 --> 02:28.680

02:33.412 --> 02:35.812
Oh, God, get that out
of my face, I can't see.

02:35.814 --> 02:37.448
Who put you up to this?

02:37.450 --> 02:39.616
Principal Cox... he said if we
didn't to clean up our mess...

02:39.618 --> 02:42.638
Because if this is some sort
of plot to drive me out...

02:42.663 --> 02:44.863
Val, are you wearing a bathrobe?

02:46.390 --> 02:48.291
Yeah, I just got out of the girls' shower

02:48.293 --> 02:49.592
when your little act of terrorism

02:49.594 --> 02:52.462
brought my home life to a screeching halt.

02:52.464 --> 02:55.098
Val, this isn't your home.
You shouldn't be living here.

02:55.100 --> 02:56.566
Oh, shouldn't, wouldn't, couldn't.

02:56.568 --> 02:58.768
Shouldn't leave the fridge door open, Val.

02:58.770 --> 03:01.404
Shouldn't let the cats
sleep in our bed, Val.

03:01.406 --> 03:02.539
Ahem.

03:02.541 --> 03:04.107
I wasn't complaining about the cats,

03:04.109 --> 03:05.145
it's my allergies.

03:05.170 --> 03:08.237
Yeah, well, luckily, we
are quite comfortable here.

03:08.646 --> 03:11.413
Or will be, once Jenna's
wanton act of vandalism

03:11.415 --> 03:13.348
is addressed and the lights come back on.

03:13.350 --> 03:15.684
- It was an accident.
- Since is the only place

03:15.686 --> 03:17.934
where I am free to be myself,

03:17.959 --> 03:20.692
where I can put my
toothbrush where I want...

03:20.717 --> 03:23.769
stop giving me that look
of disapproval, Biggie,

03:23.794 --> 03:27.596
I can feel it... and where
no one is allergic to my cats.

03:27.598 --> 03:29.998
Actually, Val, a lot of people
are allergic to cats here.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.433
Yeah, just students.

03:31.435 --> 03:35.203
I will go on antihistamines.
Please come home.

03:36.546 --> 03:38.647
Say it like you mean it.

03:38.672 --> 03:42.007
You know what? Fine, live at school,

03:42.112 --> 03:47.122
musty, mildewy, nasty, dark school.

03:47.517 --> 03:50.284
Some of us still have 46
days left here, you know!

03:50.286 --> 03:52.654
Okay, Jenna Hamilton, you
need to get it together.

03:52.656 --> 03:53.669
[cat screeches]

03:53.694 --> 03:54.794
And that goes for the two of you too.

03:54.819 --> 03:56.110
Fluffernut, share your fish treat.

03:56.135 --> 03:57.936
No, Val, you have to get it together.

03:57.961 --> 03:59.989
You have a great guy who
wants to work things out.

04:00.014 --> 04:01.669
Yeah? Well, you broke the school.

04:01.694 --> 04:03.775
You know what? I am not enabling this.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.067
Oh, come on. Where are you going?

04:06.069 --> 04:09.903
To class. Last time I checked,
this was still a school.

04:09.905 --> 04:12.206
Hey, you are not dismissed!

04:12.208 --> 04:14.775
I seriously can't handle
her. She's lost her...

04:14.777 --> 04:16.528
Yeah, Jenna, she's Mariah CrayCray.

04:16.553 --> 04:17.887
Good thing you've had four years

04:17.913 --> 04:19.813
to reach this astute observation.

04:19.815 --> 04:22.224
Wow, why are you so snippy?
And why is it so hot in here?

04:22.249 --> 04:25.451
You fried the school, Jenna.
There's no AC to power the AC.

04:25.476 --> 04:27.075
Why isn't anyone in class?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.167
There's no oxygen and we
can't read the whiteboard,

04:29.192 --> 04:30.491
so we're crammed in these common areas

04:30.493 --> 04:33.093
like Euro tourists on some "budge" airline.

04:33.095 --> 04:35.129
Congrats, Jenna. You've
advanced high school suck

04:35.131 --> 04:37.365
into deep throat territory.

04:38.130 --> 04:38.965
(Darlene) I haven't been to a place

04:38.967 --> 04:40.767
like this in... well, since...

04:40.769 --> 04:43.136
You know, I hadn't either,

04:43.138 --> 04:45.305
until you abandoned me and left me poor.

04:45.307 --> 04:46.317
[both chuckle]

04:46.342 --> 04:47.808
Well, I love it.

04:47.976 --> 04:51.244
They even have a spa menu. Who knew?

04:51.246 --> 04:53.446
Thank you.

04:53.448 --> 04:55.748
You know, could I get a side of bacon?

04:55.750 --> 04:56.749
Small.

04:56.751 --> 04:59.485
Or maybe large.

04:59.487 --> 05:02.864
What do you think, Darlene, small or large?

05:02.889 --> 05:04.857
Whatever you want, sweetie.

05:04.859 --> 05:06.826
It's not that bad for you.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.528
It's protein.

05:08.553 --> 05:10.817
I even eat it myself sometimes.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.167
Could I get a new fork, please?

05:14.169 --> 05:15.367
Thank you.

05:15.369 --> 05:17.103
(Jenna) Just when I had embraced the fact

05:17.105 --> 05:19.205
that it was my fault today sucked,

05:19.207 --> 05:22.307
I started noticing a little
thaw in the 90-degree air.

05:22.309 --> 05:25.777
Granted, we were now outside,
but it was something else.

05:25.779 --> 05:28.346
Things weren't just
thawing, they were melting.

05:28.348 --> 05:30.215
Eat it up before it melts! Come on!

05:30.217 --> 05:32.751
Gobble, gobble, little pigs!

05:32.753 --> 05:34.519
Jenna, this is getting...

05:34.521 --> 05:37.289
not so bad. Dulce de leche?

05:37.314 --> 05:38.931
Matty, how's your hand?

05:39.025 --> 05:42.126
Bruised from coming into contact
with the jawbone of the guy

05:42.128 --> 05:43.360
that screwed my girlfriend. How's yours?

05:43.362 --> 05:45.529
(Jenna) Okay, super specific answer.

05:45.531 --> 05:46.650
He was pissed.

05:46.675 --> 05:48.733
I should have told him
about Jake and Gabby.

05:48.735 --> 05:49.967
Have a good one, Jenna.

05:49.969 --> 05:51.836
Just leave well enough alone.

05:51.838 --> 05:53.704
The Matty and Jake bro-up was ugly.

05:53.706 --> 05:55.106
You don't want it to get uglier.

05:55.108 --> 05:58.075
Dude, you boned Matty's girl.

05:58.077 --> 05:59.343
It wasn't really like that.

05:59.345 --> 06:00.844
I heard she was the big V till you.

06:00.846 --> 06:02.278
Sounds like for once someone else got

06:02.280 --> 06:04.513
- what McKibben wanted.
- [both laughing]

06:04.515 --> 06:06.750
Yeah, wouldn't want to make that any worse.

06:06.752 --> 06:09.518
Uh, I have some terrible news.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.188
Yes, worse than sweating
out your body weight

06:12.190 --> 06:14.157
in sweltering hallways while inhaling

06:14.159 --> 06:17.560
the fetid bodily fumes
of your fellow classmates.

06:17.562 --> 06:20.295
Thanks to a certain unnamed recalcitrant

06:20.297 --> 06:24.699
whose name may or may not
rhyme with "Henna Mammalton,"

06:25.072 --> 06:27.602
school has been cancelled
for the duration of the day.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.671
[all cheering]

06:29.673 --> 06:31.173
Jenna, you got us the day off.

06:31.175 --> 06:36.145
(all) Jenna! Jenna! Jenna! Jenna! Jenna!

06:36.147 --> 06:37.612
Tamara, what is happening?

06:37.614 --> 06:41.348
They think you planned this
to get us all out of school.

06:41.350 --> 06:43.951
You're, like, their new
leader. Just go with it.

06:43.953 --> 06:46.254
Way to go, Hamilton!

06:46.256 --> 06:51.692
(all) Ham-il-ton! Ham-il-ton!
Ham-il-ton! Ham-il-ton!

06:51.694 --> 06:53.527
(Jenna) If I'd learned
anything in high school,

06:53.529 --> 06:55.963
it was that labels happen
in the blink of an eye

06:55.965 --> 06:57.497
and take forever to disappear.

06:57.499 --> 07:00.934
But this time, I was Jenna
Hamilton, school-breaker,

07:00.936 --> 07:02.502
so why not embrace it?

07:02.504 --> 07:03.636
That's right!

07:03.638 --> 07:05.872
Blackout party at the Beach, bitches!

07:05.874 --> 07:08.541
[all cheering]

07:08.543 --> 07:09.709
Is there booze?

07:09.711 --> 07:11.044
You bet your ass there's booze!

07:11.046 --> 07:14.815
[all cheering]

07:17.390 --> 07:19.257
Your parents have buttloads of booze.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.171
I still feel like I should
say something to Matty.

07:21.211 --> 07:23.778
Jenna, focus. We have an opportunity.

07:23.780 --> 07:26.479
You have become cool, which makes me cool.

07:26.481 --> 07:28.181
We cannot squander this. There are tons

07:28.183 --> 07:29.649
of thirsty partygoers counting on us.

07:29.651 --> 07:32.085
Okay, just don't touch the vodka.

07:32.087 --> 07:34.420
They buy store brand, which is too sad.

07:34.422 --> 07:37.357
Whoa! Is your mother home?

07:37.359 --> 07:40.393
T, she's pregnant. She
would never drink this much.

07:40.395 --> 07:42.428
[cat scratching and meowing]

07:42.430 --> 07:44.264
Oh, no way.

07:44.266 --> 07:45.430
- [cat screeches]
- [gasps] Oh, my God!

07:45.432 --> 07:47.399
- [claws skittering]
- [screams]

07:48.735 --> 07:50.770
Very interesting. The things you learn...

07:50.772 --> 07:54.173
Honey, Val told me what
you did to the school!

07:54.175 --> 07:57.014
Stop looking at me like
that. It's a virgin.

07:57.039 --> 08:00.345
J-town, I'm sorry I came
down on you so hard earlier.

08:00.347 --> 08:03.415
You did us all a favor.
I can't live at school.

08:03.417 --> 08:04.983
- I can't.
- Good.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.718
L-dog says I can stay here
until I figure out my next move.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.320
Are you insane?

08:09.322 --> 08:10.521
Sure there's not alcohol in that?

08:10.523 --> 08:12.290
[scoffs] Honey, come here.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.325
She is very vulnerable right now.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.895
I promise you, it will
only be a couple days.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.129
You'll hardly notice her.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.932
[cat screeches]

08:20.934 --> 08:24.269
Plus, you owe her for brushing
your little stunt under the rug.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.337
Why is she drinking all your alcohol?

08:26.339 --> 08:29.607
Oh. I'm experimenting
with artisanal cocktails.

08:29.609 --> 08:31.542
In case Biggie and I ever set a date,

08:31.544 --> 08:34.912
I want the perfect libation
served at my wedding.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.448
Set a date? You guys can't
even live under the same roof.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.216
She should still be prepared.

08:39.217 --> 08:41.419
Do you know how much
planning goes into a wedding?

08:41.421 --> 08:43.386
It is never too soon to
get out in front of it.

08:43.389 --> 08:45.523
Your mom thinks it's a terrible idea too.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.123
Oh, I'm just saying you
should think it through.

08:49.148 --> 08:50.660
And take it from an old married gal

08:50.662 --> 08:52.796
who only set a date because she had to.

08:52.798 --> 08:53.812
Oh, that's nice.

08:53.837 --> 08:56.065
I'm not saying it didn't turn out great.

08:56.067 --> 08:58.535
I just mean that Val's young

08:58.537 --> 09:02.605
and she seems a little
unsure of what she's doing.

09:02.607 --> 09:04.974
Maybe you should experience
a little more life

09:04.976 --> 09:06.309
before you commit. You know,

09:06.311 --> 09:08.177
there's a whole big world out there.

09:08.179 --> 09:11.280
You're a wise, wise woman.

09:11.282 --> 09:13.682
Why am I rushing into things?

09:13.684 --> 09:16.819
Why am I... why am I...

09:16.821 --> 09:18.054
[gulps]

09:18.056 --> 09:20.990
Where am I? Okay, spinning.

09:21.265 --> 09:23.159
Honey, I'm gonna deal with
this, but you guys should

09:23.161 --> 09:25.027
get out of here. You shut down the school.

09:25.029 --> 09:26.896
You should be partying your asses off.

09:26.898 --> 09:29.242
You have such a great mom.

09:33.370 --> 09:35.237
Top Valu? Seriously?

09:35.239 --> 09:36.772
Did you forget where the liquor store is,

09:36.774 --> 09:38.440
or do we suddenly need
ground beef and dryer sheets?

09:38.442 --> 09:40.175
They're cracking down on
fakes at the liquor store.

09:40.177 --> 09:41.410
We stand a much better shot here.

09:41.412 --> 09:43.278
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.547
This is where old people buy their booze.

09:45.549 --> 09:46.515
Booze!

09:46.517 --> 09:48.116
- Nice.
- [all cheering]

09:48.118 --> 09:49.951
Snatch it up, snatches.

09:49.953 --> 09:53.488
[all cheering]

09:53.490 --> 09:56.324
Ugh, this is so uncomfortable.

09:56.326 --> 09:57.558
(Vanessa) Look, not judging,

09:57.560 --> 09:59.600
but you did kind of hang Jake out to dry.

09:59.625 --> 10:03.359
I didn't mean to. I was
just so pissed at Matty.

10:04.296 --> 10:06.396
So not cool. I should apologize.

10:06.421 --> 10:09.204
So are you okay? You look extra sad.

10:09.206 --> 10:11.156
No, I feel like [bleep].

10:11.679 --> 10:15.042
Matty hates me because of
my dick move with Gabby.

10:15.044 --> 10:17.477
I am such an a-hole. What was I thinking,

10:17.479 --> 10:20.047
screwing over my best friend
for some meaningless hookup

10:20.049 --> 10:21.415
with some girl?

10:22.550 --> 10:24.318
Should we be chic married lesbians

10:24.320 --> 10:25.786
or banal carpooling housewives?

10:25.788 --> 10:27.821
We should be quiet and not give any details

10:27.823 --> 10:29.223
that could blow our cover.

10:29.225 --> 10:30.457
Well, I need to know who I'm playing.

10:30.459 --> 10:32.258
Just go get more paper towels.

10:32.260 --> 10:34.060
Jenna, we've OD'd on paper products.

10:34.062 --> 10:36.154
It's not environmentally responsible.

10:36.179 --> 10:37.686
Do you want booze at our party?

10:37.711 --> 10:39.533
- [gasps] What about red cups?
- No, dead giveaway.

10:39.535 --> 10:42.268
Then they're gonna know
we're gonna drink out of them.

10:42.270 --> 10:45.739
Hey. Great day, huh?

10:45.741 --> 10:47.373
Just dropped the kids off at daycare

10:47.375 --> 10:49.742
and thought I'd stock up, you know.

10:49.744 --> 10:52.311
Taking advantage of those instant savings

10:52.313 --> 10:54.279
on the paper products, which is awesome.

10:54.281 --> 10:55.815
My hubby always says, "Save a penny,"

10:55.817 --> 10:58.383
even with the new promotion at the Bureau.

10:58.385 --> 10:59.952
He's got a 501k now.

10:59.954 --> 11:01.787
401. 501 are the jeans.

11:04.591 --> 11:05.691
Nice work.

11:05.693 --> 11:07.692
At least they agreed not to call the cops.

11:07.694 --> 11:09.427
My husband's going to be very upset

11:09.429 --> 11:11.228
when I don't come home with his vodka.

11:12.136 --> 11:13.359
What are we doing here?

11:13.619 --> 11:15.386
I thought you were
driving me back to school.

11:15.388 --> 11:17.488
Oh, I thought you could
drive yourself back to school

11:17.490 --> 11:19.445
with a little style.

11:21.653 --> 11:23.587
(specialist) This is a Fiat 500L

11:23.589 --> 11:25.622
with four doors and room for five.

11:25.624 --> 11:28.625
Oh, it's just beautiful.
Sadie, what do you think?

11:28.627 --> 11:30.226
I don't need a car.

11:30.228 --> 11:31.562
This is way more than a car.

11:31.564 --> 11:34.097
This is Italian design
that'll make it stand out

11:34.099 --> 11:35.699
from everything else on the road.

11:35.701 --> 11:38.535
A spacious interior that
has so much space and light,

11:38.537 --> 11:40.303
you'll think you're in an open loft.

11:40.305 --> 11:42.305
I don't need to stand out.

11:42.307 --> 11:44.341
Oh, is that a nav?

11:44.343 --> 11:47.511
Touchscreen navigation,
Sirius satellite radio,

11:47.513 --> 11:49.111
Beats premium audio system.

11:49.113 --> 11:50.211
Bluetooth?

11:50.236 --> 11:53.783
Not just Bluetooth, but Uconnect
hands-free communication.

11:53.785 --> 11:56.118
I'm not sure she can afford this.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.386
Honey. [laughs]

11:57.388 --> 11:58.621
Of course I can.

11:58.623 --> 12:00.523
When you consider the large cargo capacity

12:00.525 --> 12:01.858
and how fun this thing is to drive...

12:01.860 --> 12:04.293
Oh, no, she can definitely afford the car,

12:04.295 --> 12:06.428
just not my love.

12:07.297 --> 12:09.365
Sadie.

12:09.367 --> 12:11.666
What? Isn't that what you're trying to do?

12:11.668 --> 12:13.369
Or did you just suddenly wake up

12:13.371 --> 12:15.004
accepting and generous this morning?

12:15.006 --> 12:18.140
I am trying to make amends
to my beautiful daughter.

12:18.142 --> 12:19.541
She sent me to fat camp.

12:19.543 --> 12:21.377
Well, might I say, it worked very nicely.

12:21.379 --> 12:23.078
Not the point.

12:23.080 --> 12:26.780
You can't just win me back
with transparent flattery,

12:26.782 --> 12:29.450
Italian design, and lofty interiors.

12:29.452 --> 12:32.520
Or a 160 horsepower Turbocharged engine?

12:32.522 --> 12:35.123
Or how about the largest
panoramic sunroof in its class?

12:35.125 --> 12:39.127
Look, you're right. I
don't know how to do this.

12:39.129 --> 12:44.832
All I know is that I'm
trying, really, really hard.

12:46.352 --> 12:48.360
You were born to drive this car.

12:48.385 --> 12:51.227
Really? I thought I was
born to eat carbohydrates.

12:51.921 --> 12:53.788
Honey, how do you remember all this?

12:53.790 --> 12:56.391
The way you hold on to this food stuff...

12:56.393 --> 12:59.126
Because it's all you ever said to me.

12:59.128 --> 13:02.162
My entire life was framed
around your obsession.

13:02.164 --> 13:05.099
I was just trying to help
you. I wanted you to be...

13:05.101 --> 13:06.883
The person you wanted me to be?

13:06.908 --> 13:10.102
Why couldn't you just
accept me for who I was?

13:10.693 --> 13:12.559
Like all the other mothers?

13:12.584 --> 13:14.828
I mean, Lissa's mom, who's a freak,

13:14.853 --> 13:17.148
put notes in her lunchbox every day

13:17.173 --> 13:19.441
telling her she loved her,
and to not touch herself

13:19.466 --> 13:21.224
because God was watching, but still.

13:21.249 --> 13:24.781
I don't... I didn't think like that.

13:25.320 --> 13:28.655
I'm learning, but I can't change the past,

13:28.657 --> 13:31.024
no matter how many times you remind me.

13:31.026 --> 13:34.761
All I can do is try to be a better mother.

13:34.763 --> 13:37.897
And all I can do is try to forgive you.

13:37.899 --> 13:38.697
You will?

13:38.699 --> 13:39.865
Try, I mean?

13:39.867 --> 13:41.301
Not because of the car.

13:41.303 --> 13:45.004
Because I want to move on with my life,

13:45.006 --> 13:47.073
and be the person I want to be.

13:54.180 --> 13:56.961
And praise, and praise.

13:57.319 --> 13:58.318
Raise?

13:58.320 --> 13:59.952
No, praise.

13:59.954 --> 14:02.387
These aren't arm raises,
they're "arm praises."

14:02.389 --> 14:04.857
They're part of the new
exercise program I invented.

14:04.859 --> 14:06.859
Okay, I don't need an exercise program.

14:06.861 --> 14:08.527
Oh, but it's so much more than that.

14:08.529 --> 14:09.995
It's the ultimate in multitasking

14:09.997 --> 14:13.833
your mind, body and spirit.
I call it "atonercising."

14:15.836 --> 14:20.071
And bow, and bow, and bow.

14:20.073 --> 14:21.973
These are called active contritions.

14:21.975 --> 14:23.575
You do them when you're contrite.

14:23.577 --> 14:26.010
Yeah, I think I'm pretty
contrite these days.

14:26.012 --> 14:28.446
Well, then what better way
to ask God for forgiveness

14:28.448 --> 14:29.681
than through exercise?

14:29.683 --> 14:31.182
Thank you, but I don't think

14:31.184 --> 14:33.828
that it's God that I need
to ask for forgiveness.

Mm, no.

- Ahem.
- Mom, hey.

15:16.461 --> 15:18.094
What are you... what are you doing here?

15:18.096 --> 15:19.997
Oh, trying to replenish the liquor cabinet

15:19.999 --> 15:21.664
before your father gets home.

15:21.666 --> 15:23.833
Plus, Mama needs a Slim Jim.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.668
These cravings are out of control.

15:25.670 --> 15:26.936
What are you doing here?

15:26.938 --> 15:29.271
Just hangin', with degenerates.

15:29.273 --> 15:30.573
Give me your money.

15:30.575 --> 15:32.909
- What?
- Oh, come on,

15:32.911 --> 15:35.110
I know what you're doing. I was 17 once.

15:35.112 --> 15:37.446
Just promise me you will not drive.

15:37.448 --> 15:38.480

15:38.482 --> 15:39.882
Get off your high horse.

15:39.884 --> 15:40.950
It's not like you won't find someone else

15:40.952 --> 15:42.617

15:48.724 --> 15:50.992
Oh. We're getting low on alcohol.

Okay, listen to me. I'm sorry, okay?
