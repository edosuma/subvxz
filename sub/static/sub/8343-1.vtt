Frustration or unhappiness
are caused by the unrealized
potential in a person.

Cyrenaic hedonism supported
immediate gratification.

03:00.700 --> 03:04.780
What we should be doing is
flirting with the subject
of any worthwhile philosophy.

03:04.845 --> 03:08.252
You know, the things
we don't understand,
the things we fear,

03:08.317 --> 03:10.589

03:23.437 --> 03:28.524

I have fears that justify
a two-hour lecture.

No? What's the worst
thing that's ever
happened to you?

03:45.740 --> 03:50.268
My brother,
my older brother,
he died when I was 15.

03:52.444 --> 03:54.524
How did he, uh...
How did he die?

03:54.589 --> 03:56.379
A car accident.

03:57.068 --> 03:58.572
He was drunk.

04:01.595 --> 04:06.601
Losing an older sibling

Come on. No fear of
your own mortality?

04:13.291 --> 04:16.523
No, there's not fear.
It was anger,
and it was sadness.

04:17.867 --> 04:21.546
Not fear.
Fear would've
been selfish.

04:23.147 --> 04:27.178

I lead a pretty
dull life.

19:41.220 --> 19:44.483
The way his flesh
smelled when he'd
come home from work.

19:44.547 --> 19:49.651
This heavy,
metallic smell

19:49.715 --> 19:54.341
that would follow him
home from the plant,
like, um,

19:57.987 --> 20:00.259

20:03.652 --> 20:05.730

20:12.837 --> 20:16.386
I can hardly stand to look
at a piece of meat now,

about eating it.

fuck you up?

I thought he might
actually convince me.

for this?

got a good one today.

27:00.281 --> 27:05.849
Joshua, what is
your strongest memory
of feeling fear?

27:05.913 --> 27:10.392
When I was six years old,
um, I was hit by a car,

27:10.457 --> 27:15.496
and the concussion
left me deaf
for three years.

27:17.641 --> 27:20.056
So, I went from
being, you know,

27:21.561 --> 27:26.568
a normal kid
to being completely
cut off from the world.

27:28.296 --> 27:33.495
When it got really bad,
I had a prayer.
My mom taught it to me.

27:33.561 --> 27:37.304
It's, "Gentle Jesus..."

27:38.472 --> 27:41.368
Something...

27:41.433 --> 27:43.672
"Look upon this
little child and..."

Still, you know,

28:01.095 --> 28:07.639
I hear any volume of sound,
and the ringing
comes back, and...

28:09.575 --> 28:12.679
Even talking
about it,

28:14.263 --> 28:16.295
you know,
it brings back

28:17.528 --> 28:20.263
a feeling of dread.

28:24.663 --> 28:28.326
I mean, I suppose
that is the worst
part of it all.

28:28.390 --> 28:29.894

the notion

28:29.959 --> 28:34.054
that the thing
that causes you

could come back
at any time.

you would just do it.

remember my first day
at kindergarten.

32:47.696 --> 32:50.016
I was wearing
a light blue dress,

32:51.232 --> 32:53.648
and I was there no
more than 10 minutes

32:53.713 --> 32:56.976
before some boy asked me
what was wrong with my face.

32:59.344 --> 33:03.231
That was the first time
I realized I had something
to be ashamed of.

a lot worse than
a birthmark covering my body.

hard to swallow

look in the mirror
to fix my hair.

at my sisters.

when I was five years old

to ask me every day
of my life.

to meet someone
for the first time,

43:38.466 --> 43:40.847
STEPHEN: Last one.
I got some beer and shit,

43:40.912 --> 43:43.471
but we really gotta cram
the night if we wanna get
everything done.

43:43.536 --> 43:44.558
CHERYL: How many
did you get?

43:44.625 --> 43:45.807
Six-pack.

43:45.872 --> 43:49.102
You can't really have one.
They're all six for me.

43:49.168 --> 43:50.991
Come on,
give me a beer.

43:51.055 --> 43:53.215
I'll be downstairs.
I'm gonna get
set up, all right?

43:58.016 --> 44:01.725
I was confined to
a house for the better
part of 20 years.

44:01.790 --> 44:04.238
It was my
mother's house.

44:04.303 --> 44:07.392
I was professionally
diagnosed
with agoraphobia.

44:08.833 --> 44:12.190
So, you would
never leave the house.

44:12.256 --> 44:16.575
How did you do anything
like get food
or toilet paper?

44:16.640 --> 44:19.839
Well, I was completely
dependent on my mother,

44:19.904 --> 44:22.558
and I had developed
a severe hatred for her.

44:24.399 --> 44:27.551
She was the cause
of everything
horrible in my life,

44:29.343 --> 44:31.166
but she was
my only friend.

44:34.623 --> 44:38.157
She died when I was 21.
Heart attack.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.582
I never told anyone.

44:43.646 --> 44:48.878
I didn't call anyone.
I never had. I couldn't.

44:48.943 --> 44:52.222
About three weeks later,
the neighbors noticed
the smell, I guess,

44:52.287 --> 44:55.230
and they came over
and called an ambulance.

44:55.295 --> 44:58.798
After that, they came
and checked on me
quite frequently.

44:58.894 --> 45:00.190
It's a good thing
they did, too,

45:00.095 --> 45:03.821
because the day I tried
to commit suicide
they found me.

45:08.318 --> 45:10.719
Would you mind
talking about that?

45:19.535 --> 45:21.710
I cut my throat
with a razor.

45:27.214 --> 45:29.133
I was dead
for five minutes.

45:33.454 --> 45:35.213
But that's why I'm here.

45:36.702 --> 45:39.980
Three years ago,
I could not step
out of my house.

45:42.302 --> 45:46.619
And now the world is at
my feet, and it's because
when I came back,

45:48.605 --> 45:50.957
I came back
completely fearless.

45:52.045 --> 45:53.198
You're a fucking liar.

45:53.263 --> 45:54.987
CHERYL: Quaid.
Excuse me?

45:55.052 --> 45:58.171
You don't come in here
and lie to me and tell me
you're fucking fearless!

45:58.235 --> 45:59.836

45:59.901 --> 46:01.340

46:09.373 --> 46:10.587

46:12.893 --> 46:14.220

good for my reel.

46:30.076 --> 46:33.372
You can't just attack
someone like that.

46:33.438 --> 46:35.371
I was right,
wasn't I?

46:35.436 --> 46:36.762

Results from this

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.283
They've been much more
rewarding as of late.

01:13:37.267 --> 01:13:40.114
It's beef.
Slightly salted,
well-cooked.

did you do?

I swear she's not here.

I just wanted you to see
the next phase of my study.

I'm beginning to get
the results I need.

a little fucking better,

My nightmares
have stopped cold.

01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:20.641
I think she believed
she could outwait me.

01:14:23.457 --> 01:14:26.385
She hated even
the smell of it.

01:14:26.451 --> 01:14:30.754
And all those memories of
her father are flooding
back to her, I'm sure.

01:14:30.818 --> 01:14:32.912
Flooding back as if
they were yesterday.

01:14:41.952 --> 01:14:43.794
How long did you
keep her in there?

01:14:45.778 --> 01:14:47.666
Till the point
was proven.

01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:07.616
God, she looks sick.

ended up cursing me out

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.390
whenever she had
a confrontation
with the meat.

01:15:41.456 --> 01:15:43.263
Go to hell, fuckhead!

01:15:50.528 --> 01:15:52.527
I'm not gonna do it.

I'm not gonna give
you what you want.

I'd rather die than
eat your fucking meat.

01:16:09.823 --> 01:16:14.015
About now she
began to hallucinate.
Little mental ticks.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.318
She'd think that she'd felt
something in her hair

01:16:20.384 --> 01:16:22.910
or something on
the back of her neck.

01:16:32.143 --> 01:16:33.598
God, the meat looks...

01:16:33.663 --> 01:16:34.671
Ripe?

01:16:37.519 --> 01:16:39.790
It's warm in
her little room.

01:16:41.615 --> 01:16:45.358
And there's a few
flies in there with her.

01:16:45.423 --> 01:16:48.366
They found the meat
and laid their eggs.

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:52.093
Was that a part
of your plan, too?

01:16:52.157 --> 01:16:53.436
Yes.

Well, that's the crux of
her dilemma, isn't it?

01:16:58.767 --> 01:17:01.454

the worse it gets.

I'm sorry.

01:19:16.715 --> 01:19:19.497

suddenly she gave in.

01:19:20.235 --> 01:19:22.906
Fuck...

01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:26.794
She sat in the middle of
the room and ate the meat
down to the bone.

01:19:26.892 --> 01:19:28.330
Just like that.

01:19:35.994 --> 01:19:37.609
Where did she go?

01:19:39.161 --> 01:19:41.641
Well, she wandered downstairs.
She came into the kitchen,

01:19:41.706 --> 01:19:43.385
drank several
glasses of water.

01:19:43.403 --> 01:19:45.914
Then she sat on a chair
for three or four hours,

01:19:45.978 --> 01:19:48.569
and then I cooked
her something to eat,
potatoes, and then she left.

01:19:48.634 --> 01:19:52.314
You're fucking lying.
I know it.
Where is she?

that was the limits.

01:25:25.826 --> 01:25:29.697
Someone once
wrote that no man
can know his own death.

01:25:29.761 --> 01:25:33.056
But to know the death
of others, intimately,

01:25:33.121 --> 01:25:38.544
to watch the tricks that
the mind would surely perform
to avoid the bitter truth,

01:25:38.610 --> 01:25:41.712
that was a clue to
death's nature, wasn't it?

01:25:43.985 --> 01:25:47.552
That might, in some
small way, prepare
a man for his own death.

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:05.089

vicariously was the safest,
