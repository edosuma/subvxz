[narrator] <i>Crossroads!</i>

00:17.934 --> 00:19.602
<i>After leaving the Jedi Order,</i>

00:19.686 --> 00:23.565
<i>Ahsoka Tano finds herself</i>
<i>far away from the life she once knew.</i>

00:23.648 --> 00:25.525
<i>Here in the underworld of Coruscant,</i>

00:25.608 --> 00:29.738
<i>she meets Trace Martez, an aspiring pilot,</i>
<i>and her older sister Rafa,</i>

00:29.821 --> 00:32.949
<i>a streetwise gambler</i>
<i>with lofty aspirations.</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:34.534
<i>In their short time together,</i>

00:34.617 --> 00:38.496
<i>Ahsoka realizes</i>
<i>not everyone sees the Jedi as heroes,</i>

00:38.580 --> 00:41.499
<i>a lesson</i>
<i>she only recently learned herself.</i>

00:53.511 --> 00:56.056
I can tell
you've worked on starships before.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.391
That must have been
some academy you went to Topside.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.810
Yeah, the best.

01:01.644 --> 01:02.771
What was it called?

01:03.104 --> 01:05.774
Uh... Skywalker Academy.

01:06.107 --> 01:11.529
Skywalker? Never heard of it,
but what do I know living down here?

01:11.613 --> 01:13.698
I never really heard of any academy.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.742
Not like I was ever gonna attend one.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.452
Why not?

01:17.702 --> 01:20.955
First,
there aren't any academies down here.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.917
Second, if there was,
I couldn't afford it.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.044
I mean, look around. This is it.

01:28.338 --> 01:32.926
Rafa and I inherited this hangar
after our parents... split.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.929
And the shop Rafa owns?

01:36.012 --> 01:39.140
She won it gambling so she could use it
as a front for her schemes.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.101
Where'd you get the ship?

01:41.184 --> 01:43.561
This? This is me.

01:43.645 --> 01:48.149
I did odd jobs, mech work,
whatever I could to make some credits,

01:48.233 --> 01:50.694
and assembled it piece by piece.

01:50.777 --> 01:55.156
All that, plus Rafa chipping in.
And now I've got myself a starship.

01:55.824 --> 01:56.908
Impressive.

01:57.409 --> 02:00.161
No, impressive is coming up.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.831
Once the <i>Silver Angel</i>
revs up its hyperdrive.

02:03.331 --> 02:06.167
[chuckles] The <i>Silver Angel</i>?

02:06.459 --> 02:07.460
Yeah, why?

02:08.003 --> 02:11.172
I don't know. I just never heard a name
like that before.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.842
Wait, you're saying it's a bad name?

02:14.467 --> 02:17.595
Hey, it's your ship,
you call it what you want.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.889
Why don't you name my bike
while you're at it?

02:19.973 --> 02:22.350
I did. Trash. Its name is Trash.

02:22.434 --> 02:23.977
[scoffs] Very funny.

02:25.729 --> 02:28.940
So, once you're done,
where are you headed?

02:30.191 --> 02:32.360
I don't know. This is all new to me.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.280
That's why you should stick around.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.574
I figured I'd be on my own for a bit.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.285
Yeah, that doesn't seem
like the best idea.

02:40.368 --> 02:43.538
I mean, you crashed here
on that piece of junk.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.582
What if you didn't crash
on my landing platform?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.500
Things could've gotten messy for you.

02:48.418 --> 02:51.629
Believe me, things couldn't be
a bigger mess for me

02:51.713 --> 02:52.756
than they already are.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.092
So you'll stay a little while longer,
at least.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.802
That way we can test the <i>Silver Angel.</i>

02:59.846 --> 03:03.808
[sighs] All right,
as long as Rafa doesn't mind.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.478
"As long as Rafa doesn't mind" what?

03:07.020 --> 03:08.688
Ahsoka's gonna be staying on for a bit.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.191
You got any skills?

03:12.108 --> 03:13.276
Only useful ones.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.403
We'll find out soon enough.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.406
What's up?

03:18.490 --> 03:21.826
Look, I wouldn't ask you to do this,
but I'm in a tough spot.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.206
I hired a starship and crew for a job.

03:26.289 --> 03:29.042
You what? You were gonna leave me here?

03:29.125 --> 03:33.129
No, I was gonna do a job,
make us some money, and be back.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.007
But then the pilot backed out
and took his ship with him, and--

03:36.091 --> 03:38.426
I don't know what's worse.
That you were gonna do this

03:38.510 --> 03:41.513
or that you hired a pilot other than me
to do it with.

03:42.138 --> 03:43.848
Well, now I need you.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.642
Only as a backup.

03:46.559 --> 03:47.560
What's the job?

03:48.978 --> 03:50.313
I'll tell you once we're underway.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.107
I still haven't agreed to it.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.609
Trace, please, I need your help with this.

03:54.943 --> 03:59.072
You mean, you need the best pilot around
and the fastest ship you know?

03:59.155 --> 04:01.408
Yes, to both of those.

04:01.491 --> 04:02.992
Who looks out for you, huh?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.244
You do, Rafa.

04:05.578 --> 04:09.124
That's right.
Remember, we can't count on anyone.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.460
So we count on ourselves.
And maybe Ahsoka.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.879
[scoffs] Maybe.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.882
Come on. I wanna get going.
Go warm the engines up.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.891
You show up outta nowhere,

04:26.975 --> 04:29.352
suddenly you and my sister
are inseparable?

04:29.436 --> 04:30.687
What are you after?

04:30.770 --> 04:32.105
Excuse me?

04:32.188 --> 04:34.983
Come on. Everyone plays an angle.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.194
I don't mind,
except when it involves Trace.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.573
So tell me, what are you after?

04:41.656 --> 04:43.533
Her mech-bay? Her ship?

04:43.616 --> 04:48.830
I don't have an angle, unless maybe to
keep you both out of trouble.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.206
Hmm.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.877
You ever thought you might be the trouble
she needs to stay away from?

05:06.556 --> 05:11.978
Ahsoka, Rafa, welcome aboard the...
the <i>Silver Angel</i>.

05:12.896 --> 05:16.358
The <i>Silver Angel</i>?
[scoffs] You should rethink that.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.276
That's what I told her.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.195
Ugh, just strap in.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.408
[engines hum]

06:09.786 --> 06:10.954
Trace, where are you going?

06:11.037 --> 06:12.831
I'm just trying to get into this lane.

06:12.914 --> 06:16.334
That's a military lane. You can't go
there. That's a restricted area.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.967
[communicator beeps]

06:24.050 --> 06:26.177
-We're being hailed.
-Don't answer that.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.054
-We have to answer that.
-No, we don't.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.140
Trace, just get us out of here.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.100
Don't do anything
that makes us look suspicious.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.643
We already look suspicious.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.313
-Fly higher.
-Stop telling me what to do.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.941
-Pull up. Pull up!
-Stop telling me what to do.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.821
-[beeping]
-Don't answer that.

06:45.321 --> 06:47.615
This is the <i>Silver Angel</i>.
What can I do for you?

06:47.991 --> 06:49.784
[Yularen] <i>Have you lost your mind?</i>

06:49.868 --> 06:51.745
<i>This is military airspace.</i>

06:51.828 --> 06:55.165
<i>Civilian transports are not authorized</i>
<i>to be in this sector.</i>

06:55.248 --> 06:57.834
<i>I'll have your star pilot license</i>
<i>for this!</i>

06:58.543 --> 07:00.712
"License"? Do I need one of those?

07:00.795 --> 07:03.298
Uh, sorry. So-- So sorry.

07:03.381 --> 07:07.093
It won't happen again.
Just teaching my younger sister to fly.

07:07.177 --> 07:10.305
Oh, you're teaching me to fly?
That's a laugh.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.557
[Yularen] <i>Who is this?</i>
<i>What's your license number?</i>

07:13.016 --> 07:15.852
-[beeps]
-Just get in the transport lane and fly.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.401
[Anakin] Who was on board that transport?

07:23.693 --> 07:27.572
Oh, just some rookie pilots,
apparently on their first maneuvers.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.908
I was just about to send a detachment
to arrest them.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.173
Should I send a detachment, General?

07:47.717 --> 07:49.427
No. It's nothing.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.396
You still haven't told us
where we're going.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.775
She doesn't like surprises, I see.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.659
-[sighs]
-Really? How'd you manage that?

08:13.743 --> 08:17.163
This is what I was working towards.
Take us out, Captain.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.843
[rumbling]

08:31.553 --> 08:34.973
This is exciting.
I've never been to hyperspace before.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.475
What? What have you been flying?

08:37.559 --> 08:40.645
Oh, mainly speeders, you know,
maintenance vehicles.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.313
Whatever I could get my hands on.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.358
See why I tried to hire a different pilot?

08:45.442 --> 08:48.278
Trace's flying is more of a dream
than a reality.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.448
-What did you say?
-Oh, I-I said the ship flies like a dream.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.659
Yeah, a bad one.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.078
What? Oh...

08:57.537 --> 09:00.040
[metal clanging]

09:01.041 --> 09:03.835
I left the air brakes on.
That could've been bad.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.267
Kessel. You're taking us to Kessel?

09:20.101 --> 09:22.103
I'm taking us to fortune and glory.

09:22.187 --> 09:25.815
I've heard pilots talk about this place.
It's legendary.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.985
Yeah, it's legendary for its corruption.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.988
Rafa, what are we doing here?

09:33.281 --> 09:34.824
Picking up medicine.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.970
This place is beautiful.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.182
See, Ahsoka,
there's nothing to worry about.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.229
[birds chirping]

10:20.245 --> 10:22.580
Which one of you is Rafa Martez?

10:23.164 --> 10:24.165
I am.

10:25.041 --> 10:28.378
I am Kinash Lock, King Yaruba's majordomo.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.756
We've been expecting you.
We've prepared a banquet

10:31.840 --> 10:34.426
to show his thanks for your services.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.469
Lead the way, Sir.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.471
Welcome to the big time.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.491
[chattering]

11:03.413 --> 11:05.123
So, when is the king showing?

11:06.207 --> 11:08.793
He leaves matters like this to me.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.880
However,
if you show yourself to be dependable,

11:11.963 --> 11:15.633
you will have the opportunity
to meet His Royal Highness.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.552
We won't disappoint.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.846
I've got one of the fastest ships around.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.687
What kind of medicine are we transporting?

11:28.897 --> 11:31.149
The essence of the medicine.

11:32.067 --> 11:36.696
You will deliver three containers
of unrefined spice.

11:37.155 --> 11:40.867
Upon satisfactory delivery,
you will be awarded a full shipment

11:40.950 --> 11:45.205
and a contract to transport for us
on a continual basis.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.291
May as well get that contract ready.
[chuckles]

11:48.375 --> 11:50.085
'Cause we've got the fastest ship around.

11:50.835 --> 11:51.836
They know, Trace.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.547
We're working for a king.

11:55.465 --> 12:00.261
Many things can be made out of spice
and they're not all good.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.062
I'm not sure what you mean.

12:09.854 --> 12:14.025
In this time of war,
our spice is refined into a medicine

12:14.109 --> 12:16.361
that saves people across the galaxy.

12:18.196 --> 12:19.948
The Yaruba Family of Kessel

12:20.031 --> 12:24.828
has always been a promoter
of health and happiness across the stars.

12:26.037 --> 12:32.502
Now, come, Ms. Martez. Let us get
the spice into this very fast ship.

12:43.304 --> 12:47.767
Running spice is dangerous.
The transport ships get attacked often.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.354
Yeah,
by pirates looking for a quick score.

12:52.022 --> 12:56.818
But they always go after the bigger Kessel
transport ships, obvious targets.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.070
That's why the king hired us.

12:59.154 --> 13:01.906
We don't fit the description
of your normal transport.

13:02.365 --> 13:06.244
But we're leaving Kessel. It's not hard
to figure out what we might be here for.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.247
You know a lot about Kessel
for a mechanic.

13:09.914 --> 13:10.999
I've heard the stories.

13:11.666 --> 13:14.252
Then you better hope
the pilot of the <i>Silver Angel</i>

13:14.336 --> 13:15.962
is as good as she says she is.

13:21.926 --> 13:26.222
I'm starting to see why Rafa
didn't originally hire you for this job.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.515
It's dangerous.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.684
That's just your nerves talking.

13:30.435 --> 13:35.607
No, I'm serious. Running spice
is no simple transport mission.

13:36.066 --> 13:37.692
Rafa looks out for me.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.986
Sure, I wasn't her first choice
for this job.

13:40.070 --> 13:43.198
But she wouldn't have asked me to do it
if she didn't believe I could.

13:43.281 --> 13:46.076
How many times
has Rafa done a job like this?

13:47.410 --> 13:49.079
I don't think she ever has.

13:49.454 --> 13:52.374
So, how can she possibly know
what we're up against?

13:52.457 --> 13:55.418
Hey, there's a first time for everything.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.238
We're coming up on the mining zone.

14:29.452 --> 14:32.539
Now, this looks like
the Kessel from the stories.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.834
Spice mining
has made the people of Kessel wealthy.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.585
There's always a price to be paid.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.587
There's the platform now.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.141
Look at all those droids.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.355
The king's spice sales
must buy thousands of them.

14:58.940 --> 15:02.610
Trace, those are not droids.
They're people.

15:04.696 --> 15:07.323
[chattering]

15:29.220 --> 15:32.599
-Must be local workers.
-I think the term is slaves.

15:32.682 --> 15:37.520
Can't be. An operation this large,
the Republic wouldn't stand for it.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.938
They'd shut the place down.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.525
Yeah, you'd think they would.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.126
You're all ready to depart.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.839
Ahsoka, let's go make sure
they secure the bins.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.847
I'm not sure if I like her or not.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.642
You never like any of my friends.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.853
She's not family, Trace. Remember that.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.564
I'll keep an eye on her.
You just do your job.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.859
Kid, I got us a job.
The rest is up to you.

16:24.943 --> 16:27.278
Now, let's get this spice
where it belongs.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.881
Next stop Oba Diah, right?

16:47.173 --> 16:51.428
Oba Diah, indeed.
Marg Krim better have my money waiting.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.222
Marg Krim? The Pyke crime boss?

16:54.305 --> 16:56.933
Why am I not surprised
you know about the Pykes?

16:57.308 --> 16:59.894
As a matter of fact,
how do you know about the Pykes?

16:59.978 --> 17:02.063
I know you can't make a deal with them.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.523
Already did.

17:04.024 --> 17:06.443
Trace, how does she know so much?

17:06.651 --> 17:08.028
How do you know so much?

17:08.111 --> 17:10.196
I pay attention to the world around me,

17:10.280 --> 17:12.741
like the fact that
the Pykes are gangsters.

17:12.824 --> 17:16.202
Gangsters?
What, like Pintu back on Coruscant?

17:16.578 --> 17:20.165
No. Much worse. Galactically worse.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.751
They'll take your ship,
your life, everything!

17:23.376 --> 17:25.795
-My ship?
-Well, I took a job, Ahsoka.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.339
We need all the credits we can get.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.967
[sighs] This is bad, Trace.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.553
Rafa, what are they gonna do to my ship?

17:34.179 --> 17:37.766
Nothing! See, this is why
I didn't want you for this job.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.143
I wouldn't bring that up right now
if I were you.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.395
Why not make the best of a bad situation

17:42.479 --> 17:45.523
and deliver this spice to someplace
that can use it for medicine?

17:45.857 --> 17:47.692
-No one is taking my ship.
-Because that doesn't pay,

17:47.776 --> 17:52.655
and Trace and I have a lot of people on
Coruscant waiting for money we owe them.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.158
No. You owe them, not her.

17:55.867 --> 17:59.204
Sisters take care of each other.
We can't pay off debt with your morality.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.830
No one is taking my ship.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.833
Think of all the good you could do

18:03.917 --> 18:07.170
if we delivered the spice
to someplace else instead of the Pykes.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.298
Think of all the good you can do
by helping us finish this job.

18:10.382 --> 18:13.593
I said no one is taking my ship!

18:21.434 --> 18:22.727
What was that?

18:25.188 --> 18:26.940
-Oh, no. What did you do?
-What did you do?

18:27.482 --> 18:28.692
I dumped the spice.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.402
-You did what?
-You did what?

18:31.069 --> 18:33.738
Problem solved.
Neither one of you gets your way.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.782
And I keep my ship. You're welcome.

18:36.908 --> 18:40.787
Of all the choices you could make,
that is literally the worst one.

18:41.162 --> 18:43.665
I can't believe this,
but I agree with her.

18:43.748 --> 18:44.833
What?

18:44.916 --> 18:47.502
The spice gave us options. Now--

18:47.752 --> 18:51.715
Now we have a deal to deliver spice
to an intergalactic crime syndicate

18:51.798 --> 18:53.508
and no spice to deliver.

18:54.759 --> 18:57.512
But I thought delivering spice
to gangsters was a bad thing.

18:58.930 --> 19:03.768
It is. But you have to pay them somehow.
Right now, we owe the Pykes.

19:04.436 --> 19:07.647
Then how was turning the spice
into medicine gonna solve anything?

19:07.731 --> 19:09.399
Well, that was more of an ethical debate.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.485
I hadn't figured out
how to solve the Pyke problem yet.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.320
You two are just a pair, that's for sure.

19:14.571 --> 19:17.407
I'll tell you what, I can think of one way
to pay off the Pykes.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.284
And I'm standing in it.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.077
No one is touching my ship.

19:21.536 --> 19:22.829
You should have thought of that

19:22.912 --> 19:26.583
before you dumped 30,000 credits
worth of spice into space.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.377
Stop it, both of you.

19:29.461 --> 19:32.005
I said
I didn't have it figured it out yet!

19:32.380 --> 19:33.715
Oh, but you do now?

19:34.841 --> 19:35.842
We'll find out.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.815
Okay. Do we need to go over it again?

19:51.649 --> 19:54.402
Nope. Because no matter
how many times we go over it,

19:54.486 --> 19:57.238
I can tell you, it's not going to work.

19:57.322 --> 19:58.615
Why?

19:58.698 --> 20:00.158
Because it's a bad plan.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.327
It is a pretty bad plan.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.955
I'm sorry.
Did either of you have a better one?

20:07.582 --> 20:10.585
Well, then, sounds like my plan
is the best one we got.

20:11.336 --> 20:14.714
That's not really addressing
whether or not it's gonna work.

20:14.798 --> 20:18.051
Don't worry. I've got a trick or two
that you don't know about.

20:18.134 --> 20:19.135
Care to share?

20:19.552 --> 20:21.888
No. Not yet at least.

20:57.132 --> 21:01.302
I assume that you had no trouble
transporting the spice from Kessel?

21:02.262 --> 21:07.308
[scoffs] Not at all. This is one of
the smoothest jobs I've ever had.

21:07.851 --> 21:09.644
Hmm. Good.

21:09.728 --> 21:15.692
If anything had happened, it would have
been very unfortunate for you.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.361
Here is your payment.

21:22.198 --> 21:26.119
Now, let us take a look at that cargo.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.538
You don't trust me? I mean, you hired me.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.916
I don't trust anyone who isn't a Pyke.

21:37.213 --> 21:40.091
You want to pay us our credits
and send us on our way.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.262
Here are your credits.

21:46.097 --> 21:47.724
Now, go on your way.

21:56.107 --> 21:59.152
I take it back. I'm liking this plan.

22:02.197 --> 22:04.991
This is highly irregular.

22:05.075 --> 22:08.661
I'm going to make sure
everything sorts out to our liking.

22:09.579 --> 22:10.663
Sure.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.876
Thanks for everything.
We'll hopefully see you soon.

22:15.585 --> 22:16.586
Fire up the ship.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.006
Just a moment.

22:20.465 --> 22:23.093
I need the code to unlock the bin.

22:23.176 --> 22:26.429
Uh... I think we transmitted that
to you already.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.223
Let's get out of here, Trace.

22:41.403 --> 22:42.904
Where is the spice?

22:43.613 --> 22:45.365
What? I don't believe it.

22:45.782 --> 22:49.953
Kessel must have double-crossed you.
Well, that's really unfortunate.

22:50.036 --> 22:54.040
I want patrol ships to cut them off.
Engage the tractor beam.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.876
You better get us out of here now.

23:00.797 --> 23:01.881
Patrol ships.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.092
They won't be able to keep up.

23:05.969 --> 23:07.637
[rumbling]

23:07.721 --> 23:08.847
What was that?

23:08.930 --> 23:10.890
That is a tractor beam, Rafa.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.437
Just so you know,
when they interrogate me,

23:15.520 --> 23:18.064
I'm blaming the whole thing on you.

23:18.148 --> 23:21.526
Between the three of us,
there's plenty of blame to go around.
