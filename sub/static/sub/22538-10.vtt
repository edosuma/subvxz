WEBVTT

00:05.110 --> 00:09.660
You threw down with the loot's daughter in the file room?

00:09.690 --> 00:11.430
Very advanced, spaceman.

00:11.460 --> 00:13.490
I told you a thousand times.

00:13.510 --> 00:14.790
I didn't know who she was.

00:14.830 --> 00:17.370
Of all the pretty girls in new york city,

00:17.390 --> 00:18.780
you had to choose maria?

00:18.810 --> 00:21.460
Yeah.What happened?J. Edgar hoover's daughter turned you down?

00:21.470 --> 00:23.810
Don corleo's daughter unavailable?

00:23.840 --> 00:26.840
The boston strangler's kid have a prior engagement?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.200
Yeah, all right.
That's enough.

00:28.890 --> 00:29.770
You set me up, ray.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.080
You practically threw me at her without

00:32.100 --> 00:34.210
mentioning that she was hunt's daughter.

00:34.230 --> 00:35.760
Yeah, I had fun with that.

00:35.780 --> 00:38.050
You know, maria never mentioned it,

00:38.070 --> 00:39.830
that--that hunt was her father either.

00:39.850 --> 00:41.630
Well, that's 'cause they're estranged, spaceman.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.860
But that don't mean he ain't protective of her.

00:44.460 --> 00:45.860
It's true, sam.

00:47.510 --> 00:50.030
Anyone ever heard of a pop star named...

00:50.050 --> 00:52.170
Sebastian grace?

00:52.190 --> 00:53.370
Sebastian grace?

00:53.390 --> 00:55.870
Of sebastian grace and the electric insects?

00:55.900 --> 00:57.710
No one said nothing about any insects.

00:57.730 --> 00:59.420
I'm a huge fan.

00:59.440 --> 01:00.820
Uh, "the last planet I kissed"--

01:00.850 --> 01:03.320
that-that's one of my all-time favorite songs.

01:03.340 --> 01:06.080
Grace is here to play three nights at max's kansas city.

01:06.090 --> 01:08.010
He's reived numerous death threats,

01:08.030 --> 01:10.830
and the intelligence division deemed them credible.

01:11.350 --> 01:15.120
I have to give up a body to babit this creep.

01:16.370 --> 01:17.950
- Who wants it?
- I do.

01:17.970 --> 01:19.720
I mean, i'll--i'll take it, if...

01:19.740 --> 01:21.370
Then he's all yours.

01:21.400 --> 01:25.340
Grace is staying at the drake hotel at park and 56th.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.480
He checked in this morning.
You should head on down there now.

01:27.500 --> 01:28.650
Thanks, loot.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.630
Don't eat the brown acid.

01:35.020 --> 01:36.650

01:46.090 --> 01:49.250
We live in a small house here at the 1-2-5.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.550
and in small houses, people talk.

01:51.570 --> 01:55.670
They gossip like sugared up schoolgirls.

01:55.690 --> 01:59.530
I got it on good graft that you engaged in a little hanky-panky

01:59.550 --> 02:01.240
in the file room...

02:01.260 --> 02:03.190
During the interrogation of that russian.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.460
- Boss--
- now

02:04.480 --> 02:06.440
a gentleman doesn't kiss and tell,

02:06.470 --> 02:08.970
so I ain't gonna ask.

02:08.990 --> 02:10.650
But...

02:12.890 --> 02:14.900
The nose knows.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.690
- He does?
- Let's just say...

02:17.700 --> 02:22.160
I'll figure out who it was you defiled in my file rm.

02:22.180 --> 02:25.360
And we'll see what kind of taste you have in women.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.840
- Hey, sam?
- What?

02:33.850 --> 02:35.990
Do you mind coming with me to the drake?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.350
Just until I meet sebastian grace.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.620
I mean, the idea of it kinda makes me

02:41.640 --> 02:42.590
a little nervous.

02:42.610 --> 02:44.270
He's--he's an idol of mine, and i...

02:44.280 --> 02:45.860
You know, chris,

02:45.880 --> 02:48.460
sebastian grace will turn out to be a one-hit wonder,

02:48.480 --> 02:51.290
and "the last planet I kissed" will be his only hit song.

02:51.310 --> 02:55.550
Eventually, in around 1975, he will fade into obscurity.

02:57.170 --> 02:59.710
So will you come with me or not?

03:01.140 --> 03:02.230
Let's go.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.660
Hey!

03:14.680 --> 03:17.970
You must be my great protectors.
I'm sebastian.

03:19.710 --> 03:21.940
Well, don't just stand there scratching at your openings.

03:21.970 --> 03:24.840
Come on in.The party's just getting started.

03:24.860 --> 03:28.110
- Yeah!Aah!
- Whoo!

03:31.020 --> 03:33.040
My name is ***

03:33.060 --> 03:36.540
I was in an accident, and I woke up in 1973.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.690
i don't know how or why i'm here,

03:38.710 --> 03:40.020
but whatever's happened,

03:40.030 --> 03:42.230
it's like i've landed on a different planet.

03:42.250 --> 03:44.660
Now maybe if I can work out the reason,

03:44.680 --> 03:45.800
I can get home.

Quaaludes?
We're cops.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.220
Come, cops.
Meet my people.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.090
This is bradley.
He's my manager.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.220
Isn't he funny-looking?

04:05.240 --> 04:07.530
And this is grizzly.
He's our top dog roadie.

04:07.550 --> 04:10.140
Meet my detectives, tyler and skeleton.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.070
I'm not sure why they're required.

04:12.090 --> 04:14.570
Don't mind grizz.He also functions as my head of security,

04:14.590 --> 04:17.529
which means your mere presence here calls into question his relevance,

04:17.540 --> 04:21.709
both as a bodyguard and as a man.

04:23.650 --> 04:25.170
No, do you speak

04:25.210 --> 04:27.140
or are you just here to look adorable?

04:27.170 --> 04:29.230
Oh, he's a-a huge fan.

04:29.250 --> 04:31.220
He's a little starstruck.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.630
A huge fan of what?

04:32.660 --> 04:34.460
Uh...

04:35.540 --> 04:37.660
Of--of you.

04:37.690 --> 04:39.990
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:40.010 --> 04:41.090
Don't be.

04:41.110 --> 04:43.780
Man, I am-- i'm just like you.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.300
I sleep all day, party all night,

04:46.320 --> 04:48.780
I get paid a zillion dollars to sing onstage,

04:48.810 --> 04:52.150
I make love to at least three girls at the same time...

04:52.160 --> 04:53.660
While two others watch.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.350
See?We're practically the same guy.

04:56.450 --> 04:58.460
Practically the same.
See?Same.

04:58.470 --> 05:00.530
Here.Come meet the members of the electric insects.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.370
We've got tarantula, c.j...

05:02.390 --> 05:04.680
Daddy cincinnati

05:04.700 --> 05:08.310
ladies, come meet my security detail for the week.

05:08.330 --> 05:12.370
These are the pistons of my engine, new york edition.

05:12.390 --> 05:14.220
We got lulu...

05:14.240 --> 05:16.320
Sweet jane...

05:16.330 --> 05:17.710
Mantis.

05:19.960 --> 05:22.930
- Donna.
- Donna and...

05:22.950 --> 05:25.250
The girl with all the candy,

05:25.280 --> 05:27.650
the belle of my bedbug ball--

05:28.570 --> 05:29.940
rocket girl.

05:32.510 --> 05:33.170
Nice to meet you...

05:33.200 --> 05:35.090
- Rocket girl.
- Rocket--rocket girl.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.140
My dad wanted to be a cop.

05:37.740 --> 05:39.320
Now he's a mechanic...

05:39.350 --> 05:43.270
Which means now he can fix everything but a traffic ticket.

05:45.390 --> 05:49.050
Okay, well, I think i've had enough fun here.

05:49.070 --> 05:50.660
You gonna be okay by yourself?

05:51.970 --> 05:55.590
Thanks for, uh, coming with me.

05:57.130 --> 06:00.310
This is the greatest detail of my life!

06:00.330 --> 06:03.560
G-getting to go behind the rock 'n' roll curtain?

06:03.580 --> 06:05.460
- It...
- Yeah, good times.

06:07.470 --> 06:09.300
- Come on, detective skeleton.
- I gotta...

06:09.320 --> 06:10.680
Allow me to show you the stomach contents...

06:10.700 --> 06:11.360
Be careful.

06:11.380 --> 06:13.350
Within the belly of the beast.

06:22.130 --> 06:23.820
How do you know where I live?

06:23.840 --> 06:25.240
Ray told me.

06:25.270 --> 06:27.040
Yeah, of course he did.

06:27.070 --> 06:28.740
Nice place.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.330
Very eclectic.

06:31.350 --> 06:34.690
And why did you fail to mention that you were gene hunt's daughter?

06:34.710 --> 06:36.250
I thought you already knew.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.690
Not even close.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.380
'Cause if I did, I wouldn't have done what we...

06:41.890 --> 06:44.090
Did in the file room.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.450
Sam, my father and I haven't been close in years.

06:46.480 --> 06:49.880
He doesn't care what I do or who I date.

06:51.260 --> 06:55.460
Let's have one glass of wine.

06:55.490 --> 06:58.760
Just--just one glass.

06:58.780 --> 07:01.000
What do you say?

07:01.010 --> 07:02.780
Maria...

07:02.810 --> 07:04.880
I say you need to go.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.630
We can't do this again.

07:06.650 --> 07:08.970
We shouldn't have done...

07:09.000 --> 07:10.930
That.

07:10.950 --> 07:13.440
Look, you're very attractive, you're very smart,

07:13.470 --> 07:16.370
you know, very nice, very...

07:16.390 --> 07:18.850
Well, you're all the "verys."

07:18.880 --> 07:20.450
but...

07:20.470 --> 07:22.730
We have to shut this down.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.000
Are you serious?

07:25.020 --> 07:26.500
I'm serious.

07:28.410 --> 07:29.890
Fine.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.830
So long.

07:32.850 --> 07:34.810
Oh, and keep the wine.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.490
Maybe you can use it to loosen the stick up your ass.

07:44.550 --> 07:46.810
That's the latest death threat against the sebastian.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.210
It was waiting for us when we checked in this morning.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.740
That's a lot of exclamation points.

07:50.770 --> 07:51.130
Yeah.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.480
Well, i'll send this to the lab,

07:52.510 --> 07:54.530
see if they n lift some latent prints.

07:54.550 --> 07:58.550
We fill venues a hundred times the size of max's kansas city,

07:58.580 --> 08:00.250
but it's where he got his start.

08:00.260 --> 08:02.480
I didn't want to come here, not with this going on.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.080
New york's a breeding ground for the lunatic fringe.

08:07.150 --> 08:09.000
Where is sebastian?

08:09.030 --> 08:10.340
Where's sebastian?

08:10.360 --> 08:11.300
Where's sebastian?

08:11.320 --> 08:12.930
- Any--
- he just took off with rocket girl.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.960
Took off?
He can't just take off.

08:14.980 --> 08:16.540
Wh-where did he go?

08:20.120 --> 08:21.610
Hey!

08:21.640 --> 08:23.360
Sebastian!

08:23.390 --> 08:25.330
Where are you going?!

08:27.880 --> 08:29.500
Oh!
Oh!

08:35.240 --> 08:36.929
ah, no.

08:37.460 --> 08:38.990
new jersey?

09:03.510 --> 09:06.110
detective skeleton, you come here, too?

09:06.140 --> 09:08.130
What are you doing taking off like that?

09:08.150 --> 09:09.520
Are you trying to get me in trouble?

09:09.550 --> 09:12.590
We're hoping to catch a glimpse of a flying saucer.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.070
A flying saucer?

09:15.080 --> 09:17.730
There have been reports of u.f.o. sightings in this very spot,

09:17.760 --> 09:19.720
and I would love to see one.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.530
Well, we have to go back to the hotel.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.280
All I need is 20 minutes.
Please.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.180
Rocket girl, a-are you okay?

09:29.200 --> 09:32.030
I will be in 20 minutes.

09:35.020 --> 09:37.990
Okayfine, but only 20 minutes.

09:40.310 --> 09:43.360
Sip and savor while you wait.

09:43.380 --> 09:46.310
It's the best grape soda ever made.

10:12.260 --> 10:13.390
whoa.
Whoa!

10:28.810 --> 10:30.210
what is that?

10:30.230 --> 10:32.070
It's beautiful, baby.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.320
baby, what the--hey!

10:46.970 --> 10:49.170
Rocket girl!

10:53.290 --> 10:55.390
G-- get back!

10:55.410 --> 10:57.670
Rocket girl!

11:05.070 --> 11:08.060
- Chris, you all right?
- I'm sorry, loot.

11:08.090 --> 11:09.880
I let him out of my sight.

11:09.900 --> 11:12.860
I-i don't know what happened.
I can't remember.

11:12.880 --> 11:17.120
Bright lights in the sky, and my grape soda floated.

11:17.140 --> 11:18.740
Your what floated?

11:18.760 --> 11:21.390
Sebastian and--and rocket girl-- are they okay?

11:21.410 --> 11:23.190
Everyone's fine.
Don't worry.

11:26.170 --> 11:27.930
We haven't found the others yet.

11:27.950 --> 11:29.650
Hey!

11:31.870 --> 11:33.100
You have now.

11:33.950 --> 11:35.520
Hey!

11:35.540 --> 11:37.530
They took her, man.

11:37.560 --> 11:38.910
They took her.They took--

11:38.940 --> 11:41.010
they took rocket girl, man!

11:41.040 --> 11:43.140
Wh who took her, sebastian?

11:43.160 --> 11:44.910
The martians!

11:44.930 --> 11:47.320
The martians took rocket girl.

11:53.180 --> 11:56.200
We were just getting...***

11:56.220 --> 11:58.470
A little love thing under the moon and the stars,

11:58.510 --> 12:02.060
and there was this light in the sky

12:02.070 --> 12:03.860
and this big, crazy noise.

12:03.880 --> 12:06.200
Rocket girl gets out of the car, and then she was gone.

12:06.210 --> 12:08.570
We've heard a lot of alibis in our day,

12:08.590 --> 12:10.830
but that has got to be the fruitiest.

12:10.850 --> 12:12.850
All right?Except for the guy who told us

12:12.880 --> 12:16.100
that god came to him in the form of a pickle

12:16.130 --> 12:19.060
and told him to butcher his family.
You remember that guy, boss?

12:19.090 --> 12:21.300
Cucumber cartwright.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.730
Yeah.

12:22.760 --> 12:25.580
All I know is what I saw out on those wetlands.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.310
What about your guy, d-detective skeleton?

12:28.340 --> 12:30.190
He had to have seen what i'm talking about.

12:30.210 --> 12:31.610
He doesn't remember anything.

12:31.630 --> 12:34.780
He was too busy watching his grape soda take flight.

12:36.630 --> 12:39.690
Sebastian, what'd you put in that grape soda you gave him?

12:41.190 --> 12:44.150
A few microdots of lavender.

12:45.620 --> 12:46.900
Acid.

12:48.150 --> 12:50.170
You slipped our guy a mickey, huh?

12:50.190 --> 12:52.450
Our guy who's there to protect you?

12:52.470 --> 12:54.320
He needed to relax.

12:54.330 --> 12:56.610
He's young.He should be out snaring hoof,

12:56.640 --> 12:58.270
not wearing a necktie.

12:58.300 --> 12:59.590
Look, we checkedith the f.A.A.

12:59.610 --> 13:01.710
There were no flights anywhere near that airspace last night.

13:01.730 --> 13:04.490
That's 'cause it was a flying saucer that took rocket girl.

13:04.510 --> 13:07.280
Wait a secon you--you don't even know her real name, do you?

13:09.630 --> 13:10.850
Here's what I think.

13:10.870 --> 13:12.100
You got her out there,

13:12.130 --> 13:13.750
you were all hopped up on drugs,

13:13.770 --> 13:15.050
you start fooling around.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.220
Maybe you like it rough,

13:16.240 --> 13:18.290
'cause you prancing types always do,

13:18.310 --> 13:21.260
'cause you don't want to the world to know you got sugar in your shoes.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.940
But things went too far.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.290
You killed her by accident.

13:24.310 --> 13:28.500
But in your l.S.D.Haze, you panicked.

13:28.520 --> 13:29.640
You dispose of the body.

13:29.660 --> 13:31.260
How am I doing?

13:31.270 --> 13:33.370
Rocket girl is cool, man.

13:33.390 --> 13:36.370
She runs fast with the new york groupie scene.

13:39.020 --> 13:41.480
Emily wyatt is her real name.

13:41.500 --> 13:42.930
Bronx girl.

13:42.940 --> 13:45.890
She has a family that is worried about her.

13:45.910 --> 13:49.040
Girls are not disposable.

13:49.070 --> 13:50.920
They're not toy trains

13:50.950 --> 13:53.760
for men to take out of the box

13:53.780 --> 13:57.020
and go zoom zoom zoom with and then discard.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.350
I don't give a damn that you're some fancy rock star.

13:59.370 --> 14:02.070
You're gonna get no special treatment in my house.

14:02.090 --> 14:04.300
Now if you were mel torm?

14:04.320 --> 14:06.860
And you told me some twirl was kidnapped,

14:06.890 --> 14:08.850
abducted by space aliens,

14:08.870 --> 14:10.370
things might be different.

14:10.390 --> 14:11.900
So...

14:11.920 --> 14:14.240
You either tell us what happened to that girl...

14:16.250 --> 14:18.660
Or i'll show you my greatest hits.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.010
We need to see sebastian, please.

14:20.030 --> 14:21.780
Look, he's currently the subject...

14:21.790 --> 14:23.150
Of an ongoing investigation.

14:23.170 --> 14:23.990
You guys are gonna have to wait.

14:24.010 --> 14:24.620
Come on, man.
Come on.

14:24.620 --> 14:26.410
Yeah, I know, but i'm--i'm his manager.
I have the right to see him.

14:34.380 --> 14:35.820
Chris.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.290
Are you okay?

14:38.300 --> 14:41.970
Yeah, the--the hospital did some tests, and they said I was fine.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.690
Is there any news on rocket girl?

14:44.710 --> 14:46.940
Her name is emily wyatt.

14:46.950 --> 14:48.370
They questioned sebastian.

14:48.380 --> 14:49.830
He's in holding.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.910
He's still sticking to his story about flying saucers.

14:54.780 --> 14:56.150
Chris,ow you feeling, pal?

14:56.180 --> 14:59.780
We got rocket twirl's father here.
You want in?

14:59.800 --> 15:01.100
Yeah, I do.

15:01.130 --> 15:02.720
You sure you feeling up to it?

15:02.740 --> 15:05.620
Yeah.Yeah, i-i want to see this thing through.

15:06.270 --> 15:07.390
Come on.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.710
Cookie, anyone?

15:15.420 --> 15:16.430
These are good.

15:16.460 --> 15:18.200
Maple snaps, they're called.

15:19.260 --> 15:20.320
Although i'm not sure why.

15:20.340 --> 15:24.060
They probably use maple syrup in the recipe, mr. Wyatt.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.980
Never thought about that.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.210
You sure you don't want to try one?
They're delicious.

15:29.230 --> 15:32.800
If you don't mind me saying, you don't seem all that worried about emily's disappearance.

15:32.810 --> 15:34.990
I lost her a long time ago is why.

15:35.010 --> 15:37.090
1964--

15:37.110 --> 15:38.620
that's when she really disappeared.

15:38.640 --> 15:40.900
Well, what happened in 1964?

15:40.920 --> 15:44.330
My wife--s brought home that 45 of the beatles.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.180
"love me do," I think it was.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.310
Emily was 13 at the time.

15:49.330 --> 15:51.810
But when she heard that song-- pfft.

15:51.830 --> 15:53.710
That was the beginning.

15:53.730 --> 15:55.510
Beginning of what?

15:56.390 --> 15:58.160
Music.

15:58.170 --> 16:00.070
Music became everything to her--

16:00.100 --> 16:02.970
elvis, ricky nelson, the doors.

16:02.990 --> 16:04.890
Eventually, she grew into a woman.

16:04.890 --> 16:06.590
She got very attractive,

16:06.610 --> 16:11.150
learned she could actually use her good looks to get to know theseeirdos.

16:11.970 --> 16:14.540
That's when we lost her for good.

16:15.560 --> 16:18.180
So you have no idea where she might be?

16:18.190 --> 16:19.870
- Not at all?
- No.

16:19.890 --> 16:22.070
I doubt she's in any trouble, detective.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.730
She wanders.

16:23.740 --> 16:24.980
It's what she does.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.210
Most likely, she left that rock star after he passed out drunk

16:29.230 --> 16:31.400
and ran off to find another one.

16:32.090 --> 16:33.870
She's probably in morocco

16:33.890 --> 16:35.260
with the grateful dead.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.100
Well, we're sorry for your loss, mr. Wyatt,

16:38.100 --> 16:40.410
no matter what year it was.

16:40.980 --> 16:42.650
You know, as a parent to a girl,

16:42.660 --> 16:44.700
you expect to lose your daughter one day--

16:44.720 --> 16:48.820
firsto her friends, then to a high school quarterback, maybe,

16:48.840 --> 16:51.650
finally to her husband-- but you never,

16:51.670 --> 16:57.170
never expect to lose her to a drummer wearing eye shadow.

17:07.010 --> 17:09.190
You wanted to see me, lieutenant?

17:09.210 --> 17:10.839
I did.

17:13.869 --> 17:16.569
It has been brought to my attention

17:16.589 --> 17:19.270
that certain high jinks

17:19.290 --> 17:22.460
have been unfolding inside my house.

17:22.970 --> 17:24.550
Hi jinks?

17:26.970 --> 17:30.330
Carnal high jinks,

17:30.340 --> 17:32.840
to be more specific...

17:33.510 --> 17:36.140
In the file room.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.560
- Okay.
- I'm no prude.

17:41.590 --> 17:44.210
And god knows I understand the pressures of the job,

17:44.230 --> 17:46.400
especially when it comes to a guy like sam tyler.

17:46.430 --> 17:48.880
He's been under a lot of pressure lately.

17:48.890 --> 17:51.750
Nevertheless, it's disrespectful,

17:51.770 --> 17:54.490
especially when it extends to my team.

17:54.510 --> 17:56.040
Even y, norris,

17:56.060 --> 17:57.870
I consider part of my team.

18:03.330 --> 18:03.870
Sir?

18:03.890 --> 18:06.470
Mixing work with the personal leads to trouble,

18:06.490 --> 18:09.100
especially for the female portion of the equation.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.150
I don't want to make you uncomfortable,

18:11.160 --> 18:13.610
but you understand what i'm saying here, don't you?

18:19.720 --> 18:21.020
It won't happen again,ir.

18:21.030 --> 18:22.510
Attagirl.

18:23.790 --> 18:26.960
No more carrying-on in the house.

18:26.970 --> 18:28.650
That's allno-nuts.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.630
Be on your way.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.330
Sam, i, uh, found the guy.

18:36.350 --> 18:37.360
The guy?

18:37.390 --> 18:40.680
Yeah, he's a guy that works for the fbi in the paranormal division.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.390
The paranormal division?

18:42.410 --> 18:44.330
Yeah, yeah.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.420
- What?
- I guess, uh,

18:46.440 --> 18:48.510
nobody takes him too seriously over there.

18:48.530 --> 18:50.840
I mean, in fact, they call him "the sorcerer."

18:50.860 --> 18:52.410
but, uh,

18:52.430 --> 18:54.160
maybe we should go talk to him.

18:54.170 --> 18:55.610
What for?

18:56.090 --> 18:58.250
Look, I know this is gonna sound crazy, sam...

18:58.270 --> 18:59.630
- Uh, yeah.
- But

18:59.640 --> 19:01.570
I think that sebastian was right.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.550
I mean, there was lights and--and noises,

19:04.570 --> 19:07.080
and my grape soda floated last night, sam.

19:07.100 --> 19:11.890
Chris, sebastian told us he dosed your grape soda with l.S.D.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.450
He did?

19:19.730 --> 19:21.270
Then I guess i...

19:22.320 --> 19:24.780
I guess I always hoped that there was,

19:24.810 --> 19:27.190
you know, something else out there,

19:27.210 --> 19:30.600
you know, beyond the here and now.

19:30.620 --> 19:33.990
I mean, the--the possibility of aliens

19:34.010 --> 19:37.940
isn't that different from the possibility of angels.

19:37.960 --> 19:42.380
I mean, don't you ever think, sam, that if aliens exist, then

19:42.410 --> 19:45.290
maybe there's hope for all of us after we die.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.130
Uh, maria?

19:51.520 --> 19:53.910
Can we talk serious for a minute?

19:53.930 --> 19:55.800
Of course.
What's on your mind?

19:56.290 --> 19:59.330
You're jeopardizing sam's job with all this...

19:59.350 --> 20:01.810
Subterfuge.

20:01.830 --> 20:04.860
You know, your father would be furious if he found out,

20:04.880 --> 20:07.280
and god only knows what he might do to sam.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.920
Are you sure you're more concerned about sam's job security

20:09.940 --> 20:13.000
than you are about your own wants?

20:13.020 --> 20:15.460
Sam is my friend.
That's all.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.250
I'm sure that is all.

20:17.260 --> 20:21.920
And i'm sure that very fact drives you crazy.

20:21.950 --> 20:25.040
Hey, check it out.
Betty and veronica.

20:25.060 --> 20:27.110
Which, of course, makes you three

20:27.140 --> 20:30.250
archie, reggie and jughead.

20:32.660 --> 20:36.860
you know, ***** spaceman wasn't happy when you arrived, but I gotta say,

20:36.870 --> 20:41.250
since you showed up things have got ****** around you.

20:41.560 --> 20:46.560
********* foolish.

20:51.530 --> 20:53.770
So should we ***  "the sorcerer"?

20:53.800 --> 20:56.970
Do you really believe ******

20:56.980 --> 20:58.180
I don't know, maybe.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.610
okay, take it from me.

20:59.630 --> 21:00.930
wanting to believe sthg,

21:00.960 --> 21:02.190
doesn't make it so.

21:02.210 --> 21:04.150
- Detective!
- What is it?

21:04.170 --> 21:07.360
Rocket girl didn't go after ******

21:07.380 --> 21:09.280
She's not ****

21:09.300 --> 21:11.970
or ********

21:12.010 --> 21:14.980
if she's still missing, she's dead.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.040
and I know who killed her.

21:19.700 --> 21:22.330
His name is ****

21:22.350 --> 21:25.390
He's a guitar tech, a real creep.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.110
And why would he kill emily?

21:28.090 --> 21:29.820
We met him a few years ago

21:29.860 --> 21:33.920
at a black sabbath show.He became obsessed with emily.

21:33.950 --> 21:35.340
He asked her out a bunch of times.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.400
But she wouldn't go out with him?

21:37.420 --> 21:39.040
He wasn't in a band,

21:39.060 --> 21:41.500
and he was fat as a sow.

21:41.520 --> 21:44.560
That still doesn't explain why he would kill her.

21:44.580 --> 21:47.470
Where did you find this guy?
Bob's stupid cop emporium?

21:47.490 --> 21:52.210
Honey, how about I lock you up on charges of aggravated dumb slut with no future?

21:52.230 --> 21:55.960
No, donna, just...
Go on, please.

21:55.980 --> 21:57.850
He killed her because

21:57.880 --> 22:02.050
he couldn't stand her sleeping with all of these other men,

22:02.080 --> 22:03.200
these famous men.

22:03.210 --> 22:05.710
He said that every time she slept with a musician,

22:05.730 --> 22:08.060
he couldn't listen to that band's records anymore.

22:08.080 --> 22:12.290
He had to toss all of his creedence, his rod stewart, steppenwolf.

22:12.310 --> 22:15.290
I'll bet he did it now because zeppelin's coming to town next month

22:15.310 --> 22:17.610
and they're his all-time favorite.

22:17.630 --> 22:20.770
You were also a groupie of this traveling pig circus.

22:20.790 --> 22:26.470
Now how do we know you didn't just concoct a lie to save sebastian's bony ass?

22:26.500 --> 22:28.340
I love sebastian,

22:28.370 --> 22:29.410
but he's not for me.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.580
I prefer english rockers.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.400
Hey, if the '60s were good for one thing,

22:34.420 --> 22:39.550
it's that women can screw and be screwed by whomever we choose.

22:40.220 --> 22:43.880
I'm a father to three daughters...

22:45.200 --> 22:48.920
All who consider me just north of nobody.

22:48.950 --> 22:52.420
We got a strained relationship, see.

22:52.440 --> 22:56.040
But they resent the hell out of me for one reason--

22:56.060 --> 22:58.730
when they were growing up, I cared too much.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.910
Maybe you did.

23:04.110 --> 23:06.390
Horse muffins.

23:06.400 --> 23:11.060
In fact, after hearing you spew your muck,

23:11.090 --> 23:16.100
i'm delighted to live a lifetime of lonely easters and thanksgivings.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.880
'Cause I can always take comfort

23:18.910 --> 23:22.410
that my daughters didn't end up like you...

23:22.420 --> 23:25.860
And rocket girl.

23:27.690 --> 23:34.600
Donna, c--is there an address for--for carl stefanski?Please.

23:36.260 --> 23:38.760
Police!Hands up high, chunky trunks!

23:38.770 --> 23:41.240
- Are you carl stefanski?
- I am.

23:41.870 --> 23:43.760
- Who are you?
- I'm jack lalanne.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.720
I'm here to introduce you to a new invention.

23:45.740 --> 23:48.440
- It's called a salad.
- Do you have a warrant?

23:48.450 --> 23:50.640
I do have a warrant, but i'm afraid to show it to you

23:50.660 --> 23:53.700
'cause I spilled some marinara sauce on it, and you might eat it.

23:53.710 --> 23:55.630
Fat jokes make you happy, don't they?

23:55.660 --> 23:59.010
Oh, I feel about them the way you probably feel about chicken-fried cheese.

23:59.030 --> 24:02.560
What did you do with emily wyatt's body?

24:03.290 --> 24:04.480
I don't know where she is.

24:04.500 --> 24:07.070
- If that jerk hurt her--
- hey, guys.In here.

24:28.430 --> 24:30.100
What can I tell ya?

24:30.110 --> 24:31.860
Bare walls freak me out.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.490
You've been sending sebastian grace death threats, haven't you?

24:41.510 --> 24:42.850
No one's perfect.

24:43.290 --> 24:44.830
Where is she, you crazy bastard?

24:44.850 --> 24:46.600
Come on, carl.
Tell us where she is.

24:46.630 --> 24:48.380
- Ray.
- If I kw i-i'd tell you.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.950
I'd love to see her again,

24:49.980 --> 24:51.210
but I don't know.I swear I don't know.

24:51.230 --> 24:54.040
Huh, you killed her because you couldn't have her, right?

24:54.060 --> 24:56.000
I didn't kill her, but I loved her.

24:56.010 --> 24:57.040
I loved her to pieces.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.790
Yeah, did you leave her in pieces?

24:58.810 --> 25:00.700
Come on, ray.
Take it easy.

25:02.530 --> 25:03.940
What do we do, sam?

25:03.960 --> 25:06.840
We bring him in for aggravated harassment for the death threats,

25:06.870 --> 25:08.170
secure a search warrant

25:08.200 --> 25:11.370
and toss this place, his car, his work, see what turns up.

25:17.300 --> 25:19.000
You hanging in there?

25:19.020 --> 25:21.840
Be a whole lot easier if I had a noose.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.970
How much longer do I have to stay in here?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.340
I'm not really sure.

25:28.350 --> 25:31.830
Of course, living in a cage does have its own romantic virtues.

25:31.840 --> 25:34.310
Keeps out the big, bad wolf.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.080
Or it brings him closer to your door.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.050
That, too.

25:39.670 --> 25:43.440
Quite the existential crisis you're toying with in there.

25:44.790 --> 25:48.850
I just hope those lights that took rocket girl away guided her to bliss.

25:50.870 --> 25:52.890
I like to think that they did.

25:52.910 --> 25:55.900
Certainly would provide you with a perfect alibi.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.420
Really?

25:58.430 --> 26:01.190
'Cause I may just be a drunken reprobate, lady,

26:01.210 --> 26:04.060
but even I could come up with a better alibi than "martians took her."

26:04.080 --> 26:06.630
you saying that she was eaten by the loch ness monster

26:06.660 --> 26:09.130
would be a better story than the one you cooked up.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.620
What's your name?

26:25.240 --> 26:27.740
- Officer norris.
- Your first name.

26:27.770 --> 26:29.310
Officer.

26:32.700 --> 26:34.090
Annie.

26:35.350 --> 26:37.790
Of course.
Little orphan annie.

26:37.800 --> 26:38.810
Excuse me?

26:38.830 --> 26:40.720
Searching for a place to call home.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.850
That's why you wear that costume, isn't it?

26:43.670 --> 26:46.290
Because people will like you if you wear a funny costume.

26:46.310 --> 26:50.580
Interesting.The man-child fancies himself an armchair psychiatrist.

26:50.600 --> 26:53.850
Where did you learn about the intricacies of human frailty--

26:53.870 --> 26:56.420
during an orgy in the back of a tour bus?

26:56.440 --> 26:58.170
Don't knock it till you've tried it.

26:58.180 --> 27:00.830
No offense, but I think that your whole existence,

27:00.850 --> 27:03.520
although initially appealing,

27:03.550 --> 27:06.220
leaves a trail of destruction in its wake.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.880
You roll into town, wreak havoc, then move on--

27:08.900 --> 27:13.340
like a hurricane, only with bad hair.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.690
Look at you...

27:16.720 --> 27:18.840
A spoon with a little bit of fvor on it.

27:18.860 --> 27:20.950
Oh, it's all wildly exciting

27:20.980 --> 27:23.600
until you step back and view the carnage.

27:23.620 --> 27:25.780
Don't get sour, little orphan annie.

27:25.800 --> 27:29.820
I wear costumes, too.
I know all about their hidden comforts.

27:29.830 --> 27:31.350
What about you?

27:31.360 --> 27:32.670
What's next?Are you gonna

27:32.690 --> 27:35.720
put on a pair of pants and grow out your sideburns?

27:35.740 --> 27:37.140
Now call me old-fashioned,

27:37.170 --> 27:39.390
but it would be a crime against the better angels

27:39.400 --> 27:43.720
to see such a fair creature turn herself into one of the boys.

27:48.240 --> 27:52.130
I think the word you're looking for is "detective."

27:53.380 --> 27:56.790
they couldn't possibly make detectives that look like you.

27:57.320 --> 27:59.720
They will.

27:59.740 --> 28:13.920
Perhaps extraterrestrials are trying to harvest my intellect.

28:22.320 --> 28:25.510
Well, you're nothing if not persistent, maria.
I'll give you that.

28:25.530 --> 28:26.940
Are you gonna let me in?

28:26.980 --> 28:30.040
I-i'm not wearing anything underneath this coat,

28:30.060 --> 28:31.520
and the draft is starting to bite.

28:31.530 --> 28:32.870
You're really doing the

28:32.900 --> 28:36.390
"show up at the door with no clothes under the raincoat" thing?

28:36.410 --> 28:38.510
You know someday that'll be a clich?

28:38.520 --> 28:40.580
Someday isn't today, is it?

28:47.930 --> 28:50.320
Look, I know it's 1973,

28:50.350 --> 28:53.130
and it's a really exciting time to be a woman, but

28:53.160 --> 28:57.390
in my world, this kind of behavior was reserved for pop singers and reality show stars.

28:57.410 --> 29:00.270
No offense to harry reasoner, but

29:00.290 --> 29:03.590
I think i'm putting a better product on the field.

29:03.620 --> 29:07.060
I hear the way your father talks about you.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.000
I know there's a rift, so

29:09.020 --> 29:11.930
I can't help but wonder if you're only doing this

29:11.950 --> 29:14.420
just because you know the endless amounts of suffering

29:14.430 --> 29:17.170
it'll cause him if he finds out about us.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.600
My father and I

29:19.620 --> 29:24.820
haven't had a substantive conversation since I graduated from high school.

29:24.830 --> 29:27.700
He gave me a fancy pen with my initials on it--

29:27.710 --> 29:31.340
M.N.H., maria n. Hunt.

29:31.380 --> 29:32.780
What does the "n" stand for?

29:32.790 --> 29:35.590
That's the point.
My middle name is alice.

29:35.620 --> 29:39.300
Maria, I am really not the guy

29:39.330 --> 29:42.430
to go working your daddy issues out with.I mean,

29:42.460 --> 29:44.780
I got a few of my own, okay?

29:44.810 --> 29:46.650
And I work with your aforementioned daddy.

29:46.680 --> 29:49.880
I mean, you have no idea how unstable my world is.

29:49.900 --> 29:50.830
I'm just a visitor here.

29:50.860 --> 29:53.140
You--you do not want to get attached to me.

29:54.050 --> 29:56.110
Mm, that's where you're wrong.

29:56.130 --> 30:01.320
I-i want to attach myself to you...

30:04.180 --> 30:08.700
All night long, and en...

30:09.390 --> 30:13.360
Maybe once again in the morning.

30:20.240 --> 30:21.720
All right, just do me a favor.

30:21.740 --> 30:23.350
No more talk about your father.

30:23.370 --> 30:24.630
Okay.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.390
His name is stephen morrell, but

30:30.410 --> 30:31.530
they call him "the sorcerer,"

30:31.550 --> 30:33.560
and his entire department exists

30:33.580 --> 30:35.930
to investigate the paranormal.

30:36.460 --> 30:40.700
And he--he comprises the entire department.

30:41.450 --> 30:45.280
There's a rich and tangy firmament out there right now

30:45.300 --> 30:47.720
for the bizarre and the unexplained.

30:47.750 --> 30:50.370
The bizarre and the unexplained?

30:50.390 --> 30:51.390
Yes.

30:51.420 --> 30:55.270
Because even though all of our scientists

30:55.300 --> 30:58.690
would love to eliminate magic fromeligion,

30:58.710 --> 31:01.060
how do you do that?

31:01.080 --> 31:03.420
How do you do that when

31:03.440 --> 31:06.950
a seed sprouting from the ground --

31:06.970 --> 31:10.600
or the marvel of a functioning umbilical cord

31:10.630 --> 31:14.110
are just as miraculous as any fairy imp or

31:14.130 --> 31:19.160
army of zombies leaping from the crypt?

31:19.180 --> 31:22.390
People want to believe.

31:22.410 --> 31:26.540
And yet even the best of our scientists

31:26.560 --> 31:30.960
skew the credibility of their theories

31:30.990 --> 31:34.400
with unwarranted assumptions.

31:34.420 --> 31:39.880
The key is to avoid falling for contrived realities

31:39.900 --> 31:46.340
and to get back to what has always been the fundamental reason for science...

31:47.450 --> 31:51.180
To learn about new things.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.100
So...

31:53.130 --> 31:57.100
Has there ever been a u.F.O.Sighting in the meadowlands?

31:57.110 --> 31:58.700
Oh,

31:58.730 --> 32:00.950
quite a few, in fact.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.060
Okay.

32:03.810 --> 32:08.100
So assuming that our missing girl was taken by aliens

32:08.120 --> 32:10.890
or whatever, uh,

32:10.910 --> 32:12.910
w-where do you think that she might be?

32:12.930 --> 32:16.580
Most likely she's wandering the streets of new york city,

32:16.610 --> 32:18.080
but...

32:18.100 --> 32:20.550
Somewhere in the past.

32:21.110 --> 32:22.890
The past?

32:25.210 --> 32:31.900
Well, many who claim to have been abducted by aliens share similar stories--

32:31.920 --> 32:34.520
the spaceship snatched them up

32:34.550 --> 32:36.350
and took them on a journey

32:36.380 --> 32:40.990
only to plop them back down in the same place they were snatched from,

32:41.010 --> 32:43.420
but years earlier.

32:47.740 --> 32:50.530
Will emily wyatt ever get back home?

32:52.310 --> 32:54.710
It's difficult to say.

32:54.730 --> 32:57.540
Maybe or maybe not.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.920
But if she does,

32:59.940 --> 33:04.050
she'll doubtless retain no memory of what happened to her.

33:04.070 --> 33:10.240
In some ways, she'll always remain "missing."

34:18.730 --> 34:20.590
oh, my god.

34:27.260 --> 34:29.110
i'm here!

34:29.130 --> 34:31.489
Here!
I'm here!

34:34.920 --> 34:37.000
i'm here!

34:37.699 --> 34:40.170
Take me home!

34:40.960 --> 34:43.540
Take me home!

34:43.560 --> 34:45.100
Please!

34:46.620 --> 34:48.560
I wanna go home!

35:24.690 --> 35:29.580
it's a specialized, unauthorized area of the wetlands

35:29.610 --> 35:36.020
which is often used as a testing ground for new military aircraft--

35:36.040 --> 35:41.470
in this case, a prototype helicopter with terrain-following radar

35:41.500 --> 35:44.750
that allows it to perform what are called

35:44.780 --> 35:46.940
"nape of the earth" missions.

35:46.950 --> 35:49.140
The l.S.D.That you and sebastian grace imbibed

35:49.170 --> 35:51.200
made it seem more than that.

35:51.220 --> 35:53.620
There were no martians, no spaceship.

35:53.640 --> 35:57.260
And carl stefanski was not involved.

35:58.630 --> 36:00.920
But, uh, how did rocket girl die?

36:00.940 --> 36:05.980
The thrust of the aircraft is so strong

36:05.990 --> 36:08.290
that it actually forced her down

36:08.320 --> 36:12.850
deep into that soft, porous swale of the wetlands.

36:19.530 --> 36:21.940
So basically she drowned.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.200
Yes.

36:23.230 --> 36:24.990
There was no crime.

36:25.730 --> 36:27.810
You hear that, chris?

36:27.830 --> 36:31.190
The earth is safe from the little green men once again.

36:31.210 --> 36:34.500
And this time, the contrived reality was the correct explanation.

36:34.510 --> 36:36.420
Yes, but

36:36.440 --> 36:39.990
how do you know they're not on their way here now?

36:40.010 --> 36:43.390
Yeah, well, I hope they're bringin' a pizza, 'cause i'm starvin'.

36:43.420 --> 36:45.780
I guess we'll have to cut the rock star loose.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.700
Well, at least we nailed stefanski for making death threats against him.

36:48.730 --> 36:50.370
Yeah,

36:50.390 --> 36:53.270
keeping the world once again safe

36:53.300 --> 36:56.650
for the arrogant bastards who treat girls like crap.

37:04.400 --> 37:07.560
This one is for rocket girl.

37:43.230 --> 37:44.210
hello.

37:44.230 --> 37:45.480
What's this?

37:45.490 --> 37:49.160
Two backstage passes to tonight's gig at max's kansas city.

37:49.180 --> 37:51.000
Apparently, i'm a free man,

37:51.030 --> 37:53.590
and the show will go on.

37:53.610 --> 37:55.520
I have plans tonight.

37:55.550 --> 37:57.070
Oh, come on.

37:57.100 --> 38:00.140
Let me show you some more intricacies of human frailty.

38:00.160 --> 38:01.860
I know 'em all.

38:05.390 --> 38:06.600
No.

38:06.630 --> 38:08.900
Well, just think about it.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.990
I don't know how much longer i'm gonna be in this racket.

38:13.010 --> 38:15.710
This whole rocket girl thing has just

38:15.730 --> 38:20.090
really got me thinking about forever.

38:33.190 --> 38:34.090
one more thing,

38:34.130 --> 38:38.320
because it would be a violation of my subculture not to say it--

38:38.330 --> 38:44.690
you are a really, really, really...

38:44.710 --> 38:48.170
Really sexy chick, little orphan annie.

39:14.100 --> 39:15.710
You okay?

39:15.740 --> 39:19.210
You know, i-i just wisthat everything wasn't so...

39:20.560 --> 39:21.970
Explainable.

39:21.990 --> 39:23.520
Trust me.
Everything's not.

39:23.550 --> 39:27.430
You know, i-i wish that there was just a sign, you know,

39:27.450 --> 39:30.030
that things aren't always what they seem.

39:30.050 --> 39:32.650
We live, we die...

39:32.700 --> 39:34.250
Nobody knows why.

39:55.130 --> 39:57.080
I wanted to give you something.

39:59.600 --> 40:01.870
It's a saint christopher medal.

40:01.890 --> 40:03.320
I want you to have it.

40:03.350 --> 40:04.150
What for?

40:04.180 --> 40:07.290
Saint christopher is the patron saint of travelers.

40:08.260 --> 40:10.400
I think of you as a traveler, sam.

40:19.730 --> 40:21.240
whoa.
Where are you going?

40:21.270 --> 40:23.120
To the sebastian grace concert.

40:23.140 --> 40:24.750
He gave me two tickets.

40:24.780 --> 40:26.000
Do you want to go?

40:26.020 --> 40:28.950
Yeah.
I mean, that sounds like fun.

40:28.970 --> 40:30.470
I was talking to chris.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.050
Okay.

40:33.270 --> 40:34.900
Heck, yeah!

40:34.930 --> 40:37.010
Thanks.
I...

40:37.400 --> 40:38.710
I'll see you, sam.

40:39.540 --> 40:40.460
Bye.

40:40.810 --> 40:42.290
Do I get to say, "i'm with the band"?
