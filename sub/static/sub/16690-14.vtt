WEBVTT

00:02.231 --> 00:03.697
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares...

00:03.697 --> 00:05.964
Chef Ramsay heads to one
of the most famous places

00:05.964 --> 00:06.997
in America.

00:06.997 --> 00:08.897
Bourbon Street, New Orleans.

00:10.397 --> 00:13.464
But it's anything
but a party at this restaurant.

00:13.464 --> 00:15.364
Moe...

00:15.364 --> 00:17.097
You're the one who's
supposed to be over there

00:17.097 --> 00:19.231
supervising this!

00:19.231 --> 00:20.631
And Rami...

00:20.631 --> 00:22.397
Just listen to what
I'm telling you, dumbass!

00:22.397 --> 00:24.664
Who use their eatery
as a battleground.

00:24.664 --> 00:25.864
We're like enemies,
you know?

00:25.864 --> 00:27.864
All the time
bumping heads.

00:27.864 --> 00:29.931
As for the food, it's...

00:29.931 --> 00:30.000
Disgusting.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.731
Disgusting.

00:31.731 --> 00:34.131
Chef Ramsay has a steep
uphill battle.

00:34.131 --> 00:36.364
He is not only
challenged by the head chef...

00:36.364 --> 00:37.664
Step up
to the  plate!

00:37.664 --> 00:39.164
Here, this is me steppin'
up to the.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.464
Ooh!

00:40.464 --> 00:41.797
But one of the owners as well.

00:41.797 --> 00:43.597
Flip the table,
punch me,

00:43.597 --> 00:45.131
do what the
you want to do.

00:45.131 --> 00:46.697
In one of the most volatile

00:46.697 --> 00:48.031
Kitchen Nightmares ever.

00:48.031 --> 00:49.431
Anybody talks like that

00:49.431 --> 00:52.164
gets chopped up and fed
to the  alligators.

00:53.931 --> 00:56.231
Chef Ramsay
is thoroughly frustrated.

00:56.231 --> 00:57.397
How old are they?

00:57.397 --> 00:59.364
Completely disgusted.

01:00.497 --> 01:01.697
And totally appalled

01:01.697 --> 01:03.164
at the state affairs.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.564
Shut it down!

01:05.564 --> 01:07.864
Will brothers Moe and Rami
stop the fighting

01:07.864 --> 01:09.464
long enough to listen?

01:09.464 --> 01:10.797
Are you stupid?

01:10.797 --> 01:12.031
I am not stupid.

01:12.031 --> 01:13.597
Moe, you are stupid.

01:13.597 --> 01:15.164
Or will they drive
Chef Ramsay away...

01:15.164 --> 01:16.864
How  dare you?

01:16.864 --> 01:19.031
That's coming up
on the most explosive

01:19.031 --> 01:21.164
Kitchen Nightmares
of the year.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.131
We should shut down
the  restaurant!

01:23.131 --> 01:24.464
Tonight!

01:44.964 --> 01:46.697
New Orleans, Louisiana.

01:46.697 --> 01:50.930
The birthplace of jazz and
phenomenal Cajun Creole cuisine.

01:50.930 --> 01:52.397
Smack in the center of town

01:52.397 --> 01:54.964
is the world-famous
Bourbon Street,

01:54.964 --> 01:58.597
an ideal location for
the Oceana restaurant.

01:58.597 --> 02:00.000
In 2008,
brothers Moe and Rami

02:00.000 --> 02:01.130
In 2008,
brothers Moe and Rami

02:01.130 --> 02:02.164
took the reins
of the restaurant

02:02.164 --> 02:03.397
from their father.

02:03.397 --> 02:05.830
At Oceana we have
quite a few problems.

02:05.830 --> 02:08.364
All these salads
in the  freezer?

02:08.364 --> 02:10.064
Man, this is frozen,
look at that.

02:10.064 --> 02:11.597
That's frozen.

02:11.597 --> 02:14.497
I would say we need
to start with Moe.

02:14.497 --> 02:16.564
They don't want no sauce
on that thing, man!

02:16.564 --> 02:18.430
You're the one
who put the sauce on it!

02:18.430 --> 02:19.964
I'm the older,
I'm the wiser brother.

02:19.964 --> 02:22.464
I'm the boss here, and
I'm the one who runs the ship.

02:22.464 --> 02:23.930
I kind of want it
to be a little salty

02:23.930 --> 02:25.397
so they can drink
more liquor.

02:25.397 --> 02:26.997
You really don't
want to be here

02:26.997 --> 02:28.764
when Moe and Rami
is pissed off.

02:28.764 --> 02:30.000
Moe, do me a favor!

02:30.000 --> 02:30.464
Moe, do me a favor!

02:30.464 --> 02:31.730
Go do what you're
supposed to do.

02:31.730 --> 02:33.197
Stand on the floor!

02:33.197 --> 02:35.730
Moe is the biggest hot head
in the world.

02:35.730 --> 02:36.964
What--what is this?

02:36.964 --> 02:38.330
They'll yell at you, fire you,

02:38.330 --> 02:39.697
and you're out the door
in 30 seconds.

02:39.697 --> 02:41.064
You want your job
or you don't want your job?

02:41.064 --> 02:42.630
I want my job,
but this is--

02:42.630 --> 02:44.464
just listen to what the
I'm telling you, dumbass!

02:44.464 --> 02:46.564
Chef Damon always
making mistakes.

02:46.564 --> 02:48.097
It's bland, chef,
taste it.

02:48.097 --> 02:49.964
- It's bland.
- It has no  flavor.

02:49.964 --> 02:51.464
He's not consistent
with his food.

02:51.464 --> 02:53.330
That's a fantastic
piece of fish.

02:53.330 --> 02:54.830
It's a piece of
piece of fish.

02:54.830 --> 02:56.930
There's nothing wrong
with it.

02:56.930 --> 02:57.797
Moe thinks
Chef Damon can't cook,

02:57.797 --> 03:00.000
But I don't believe so.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.230
But I don't believe so.

03:00.230 --> 03:03.697
This kitchen is a total
nightmare.

03:03.697 --> 03:05.830
The floors are disgusting.

03:07.630 --> 03:09.764
It's like water
squishing everywhere,

03:09.764 --> 03:13.697
and, like, they're sticky
and dirty and disgusting.

03:13.697 --> 03:15.130
Nothing clean.

03:15.130 --> 03:16.897
Nothing--nothing's done.

03:19.564 --> 03:20.930
We have rats.

03:22.864 --> 03:24.430
In front of the customers,
we say "Bunnies,"

03:24.430 --> 03:25.597
'cause they don't know
what we talking about.

03:25.597 --> 03:26.964
But we're talking about
a big-ass rat.

03:30.164 --> 03:31.597
The biggest one I've seen...

03:31.597 --> 03:32.730
About that big.

03:32.730 --> 03:33.797
That ain't counting the tail.

03:35.464 --> 03:36.864
Big  deal?

03:36.864 --> 03:38.630
Like you've never seen
a rat in your life.

03:40.364 --> 03:42.497
Do not overcook that tuna!

03:42.497 --> 03:44.464
He acting like he knows
what he's talking about.

03:44.464 --> 03:46.464
It's gonna be a challenge
for Chef Ramsay

03:46.464 --> 03:48.964
to make Moe change his mind
or his opinion.

03:48.964 --> 03:51.964
But we are absolutely in need
for Chef Ramsay at this point.

03:51.964 --> 03:55.297
Do you understand that
we lost tons of money tonight?

03:55.297 --> 03:57.330
I want to walk around
my restaurant

03:57.330 --> 03:58.464
like a proud tiger.

03:58.464 --> 04:00.000
Right now, I'm not proud.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.164
Right now, I'm not proud.

04:01.164 --> 04:03.530
I need Chef Ramsay to come here
and give me a hand

04:03.530 --> 04:06.397
and show me the right way
and the wrong way.

04:13.764 --> 04:14.997
Bourbon Street.

04:14.997 --> 04:16.997
What an amazing location
for a restaurant.

04:16.997 --> 04:18.030
Right.

04:18.030 --> 04:19.797
Oceana. Ooh.

04:20.964 --> 04:22.297
Hello.
How are you?

04:22.297 --> 04:23.330
Great, how are you?
Good to see you.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.930
So first name is...
Rami.

04:24.930 --> 04:26.164
Rami and...
Moe.

04:26.164 --> 04:27.464
Moe.
Okay, great.

04:27.464 --> 04:29.397
Father, son?
Oh, brothers.
Yeah, yeah.

04:29.397 --> 04:30.000
I think Chef Ramsay
gonna love me.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.964
I think Chef Ramsay
gonna love me.

04:30.964 --> 04:33.464
I think Chef Ramsay gonna know
that I'm the real deal.

04:33.464 --> 04:35.264
And we're gonna make
things happen together.

04:35.264 --> 04:36.264
You ready
to sit down?

04:36.264 --> 04:37.464
Yeah, let's go
and have a...

04:37.464 --> 04:39.197
chat in the kitchen.

04:43.030 --> 04:44.264
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:44.264 --> 04:45.330
Well, it's a long story,

04:45.330 --> 04:47.197
so I can go ahead
and explain to you.

04:47.197 --> 04:48.564
Please.
This was an addition

04:48.564 --> 04:50.530
that we added to Oceana...
Oh, really?

04:50.530 --> 04:51.597
In--in the later years.

04:52.730 --> 04:54.030
It is just one doorway.

04:54.030 --> 04:55.530
Once you cross it,

04:55.530 --> 04:57.464
you feel like you're in
total different restaurant.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.330
So it's very confusing.

04:59.330 --> 05:00.000
So, young, hip, cool
New Orleans vibe.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.797
So, young, hip, cool
New Orleans vibe.

05:02.797 --> 05:04.664
"N'awlens," Chef.
"N'awlens, n'awlens.

05:04.664 --> 05:05.597
N'awlens. N'awlens."

05:05.597 --> 05:07.264
Yes, not "New Orleans."

05:07.264 --> 05:09.130
No, "n'awlens."
Yeah, they say it locally.

05:09.130 --> 05:10.430
"N'awlens."
I mean,
this is the South.

05:10.430 --> 05:12.730
"New Orleans."
Ain't nobody say "New Orleans."

05:12.730 --> 05:14.497
If you go outside,
say "New Orleans,"

05:14.497 --> 05:16.130
people gonna laugh at you.

05:16.130 --> 05:17.630
So we had to edu-a-cate him.

05:17.630 --> 05:21.097
It's "n'awlens.
N'awlens."

05:21.097 --> 05:23.297
So two different restaurants.
two different identities.

05:23.297 --> 05:25.664
Now it's one kitchen.
Two menus?

05:25.664 --> 05:26.764
Same menu.

05:26.764 --> 05:28.230
Same menu.
Jesus.

05:28.230 --> 05:29.697
I tried to tell him

05:29.697 --> 05:30.000
we should combine
the two sides, Chef.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.030
we should combine
the two sides, Chef.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.164
But he doesn't
want to understand

05:32.164 --> 05:34.430
that people confused.

05:34.430 --> 05:35.697
My brother and I,
we're like enemies, you know?

05:35.697 --> 05:37.230
All the time bumping heads.

05:37.230 --> 05:38.530
Anyway, let me have
a look at the menu.

05:38.530 --> 05:40.397
I'm gonna eat, and we'll
catch up later, yeah?

05:40.397 --> 05:42.264
Thanks for the insight.
Good to see you, Chef.
Thank you.

05:42.264 --> 05:44.130
Likewise.
Good to see you too.
Chef.

05:45.497 --> 05:46.564
I heard Chef Ramsay
was a hot head,

05:46.564 --> 05:47.797
which I'm very used to.

05:47.797 --> 05:50.264
My bosses are hot heads.

05:50.264 --> 05:52.397
It might be a cat fight.

05:52.397 --> 05:54.864
How long you been her?
Been here 17 months.

05:54.864 --> 05:55.964
17 months.
Yes.

05:55.964 --> 05:58.730
Good girl. Okay...
Uh, who's that?

05:58.730 --> 05:59.830
That is our old chef.

05:59.830 --> 06:00.000
Oh, bless him.
Has he died?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.730
Oh, bless him.
Has he died?

06:01.730 --> 06:02.664
No, no.
He was just fired.

06:02.664 --> 06:03.697
What?

06:03.697 --> 06:04.697
Damn. Who's that?

06:04.697 --> 06:05.764
That is our old server.

06:07.464 --> 06:09.364
Yes, he's...fired.
Ah, jeez.

06:09.364 --> 06:10.797
If they don't like you
they get rid of you.

06:10.797 --> 06:12.664
And it's the same with
the waiting staff as well?

06:12.664 --> 06:14.397
It's the same with
anybody that works here.

06:14.397 --> 06:16.430
Moe and Rami
are very aggressive.

06:16.430 --> 06:18.630
They're very intimidating,

06:18.630 --> 06:20.197
which makes it hard
to work with them.

06:20.197 --> 06:21.430
Well, you're doing brilliant.
17 months.

06:21.430 --> 06:23.164
I know, I've been fired
four times, though.

06:23.164 --> 06:24.864
You've been fired what?

06:24.864 --> 06:25.897
Four times.

06:25.897 --> 06:27.597
Oh,.

06:27.597 --> 06:29.564
Four times
in the last 17 months.

06:29.564 --> 06:30.000
Actually, I was fired again
two or three weeks ago.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.064
Actually, I was fired again
two or three weeks ago.

06:32.064 --> 06:33.564
Actually, I just came back.

06:33.564 --> 06:35.664
I been back, like,
maybe two weeks.

06:35.664 --> 06:37.797
Welcome back, sweetheart.
Thank you.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.030
I'm so glad
you're back.

06:39.030 --> 06:40.030
I love your energy.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.730
Right, let's go.

06:41.730 --> 06:42.630
So seafood gumbo.

06:42.630 --> 06:44.164
Seafood gumbo, and what else?

06:44.164 --> 06:45.597
Yeah, let's go for
the crab cake platter.

06:45.597 --> 06:47.164
Platter.
And, you know what?

06:47.164 --> 06:48.164
I love duck.

06:48.164 --> 06:49.997
The blackened bayou duck.

06:49.997 --> 06:51.297
Okay, great.
Put my order in.

06:51.297 --> 06:52.797
Gotcha.
Be right back.
Good to meet you.

06:52.797 --> 06:54.830
Fired four times.

06:54.830 --> 06:56.530
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

06:56.530 --> 06:59.464
Listen up, Chef Ramsay
about to have some food, okay?

06:59.464 --> 07:00.000
So I want to impress him,
please, all right?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.030
So I want to impress him,
please, all right?

07:01.030 --> 07:02.230
Heard that.
Listen up.

07:02.230 --> 07:03.764
Crab cake platter!

07:03.764 --> 07:04.697
Blackened duck!

07:04.697 --> 07:05.864
And a bowl of gumbo.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.997
I'm the executive chef.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.097
I can do magic with food.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.530
And if Chef Ramsay
doesn't like our food,

07:16.530 --> 07:19.597
he's  crazy.

07:19.597 --> 07:21.264
Enjoy.
Thank you.

07:21.264 --> 07:23.964
Classic New Orleans gumbo.
Wow.

07:25.597 --> 07:26.964
Oh, my God.

07:26.964 --> 07:27.997
That is disgusting.

07:27.997 --> 07:29.097
Chef is very disappointed.

07:30.130 --> 07:31.130
Whew.

07:31.130 --> 07:33.164
It tastes...Old.

07:33.164 --> 07:35.064
It's an embarrassment
to Bourbon Street.

07:35.064 --> 07:36.264
I'll take this.
You finished?

07:36.264 --> 07:38.164
Um, yeah.
That's dreadful.

07:38.164 --> 07:40.064
It just tastes old.
When was that made?

07:40.064 --> 07:41.130
Hmm. I believe today.

07:41.130 --> 07:42.130
They smell.

07:42.130 --> 07:43.197
Okay.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.230
Thank you.

07:44.230 --> 07:45.497
Look, listen.

07:45.497 --> 07:47.230
That's the food that
Chef Ramsay just ate.

07:47.230 --> 07:49.264
He said the gumbo
tastes old.

07:49.264 --> 07:50.364
Are you serious?

07:50.364 --> 07:51.364
What's the matter now?

07:51.364 --> 07:53.064
The gumbo's old.

07:53.064 --> 07:54.064
Hand me a spoon; let me see
what's wrong with the gumbo.

07:54.064 --> 07:56.064
All right, just--
I don't see.

07:56.064 --> 07:57.930
Tastes standard to me.

07:57.930 --> 07:59.430
Now tell me you don't
taste it, Chef?

07:59.430 --> 08:00.000
I think it's fantastic.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.530
I think it's fantastic.

08:00.530 --> 08:02.564
Chef, let me tell you
one thing, baby.

08:02.564 --> 08:03.730
There's nothing wrong
with that.

08:03.730 --> 08:05.064
There's nothing
wrong with it.

08:05.064 --> 08:07.364
Just trust me, chef.
Just trust me on that one.

08:07.364 --> 08:09.964
I don't think Chef Ramsay
knows anything about Cajun food,

08:09.964 --> 08:11.830
as a matter of fact.

08:11.830 --> 08:12.997
Chef, there's
the crab cakes.

08:12.997 --> 08:14.397
Thank you.

08:14.397 --> 08:15.997
Crab cakes.

08:15.997 --> 08:17.364
Enjoy.
Enjoy?

08:17.364 --> 08:18.530
Right now,
I'm trying to live.

08:18.530 --> 08:20.764
Soggy.

08:20.764 --> 08:24.197
What the hell is that?

08:24.197 --> 08:25.564
Terribly watery.

08:25.564 --> 08:27.197
Almost like it's been...

08:27.197 --> 08:29.730
Sort of defrosted...Fast.

08:29.730 --> 08:30.000
Yeah, not good.
Not good at all.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.530
Yeah, not good.
Not good at all.

08:31.530 --> 08:32.764
Are they made here,
those crab cakes?

08:32.764 --> 08:34.697
Are they frozen?
No, they
should not be.

08:34.697 --> 08:35.764
No?
They taste frozen?

08:35.764 --> 08:37.597
Yeah, that's
a gloopy mess.

08:37.597 --> 08:39.130
They taste dreadful.

08:39.130 --> 08:40.064
Damn.

08:41.797 --> 08:43.564
He said the crab cakes--
Oh, my--what?!

08:43.564 --> 08:44.730
He doesn't know
what he's missing.

08:44.730 --> 08:46.630
Listen up,
listen up, listen!

08:46.630 --> 08:47.730
The crab cakes
taste frozen.

08:47.730 --> 08:49.397
What?

08:49.397 --> 08:50.864
And he don't think
they're made in-house.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.797
What?

08:52.797 --> 08:54.064
And he got the duck,
so hope he like the duck.

08:54.064 --> 08:55.964
Ooh, ooh, if he
complains about the duck,

08:55.964 --> 08:57.597
we gonna fight.

08:57.597 --> 08:58.797
We--I mean, he better not

08:58.797 --> 09:00.000
complain about that, baby.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.597
complain about that, baby.

09:00.597 --> 09:01.930
This is
the blackened duck.

09:01.930 --> 09:04.230
Blackened duck.
Thank you.

09:04.230 --> 09:06.197
What the?
What have they done to them?

09:06.197 --> 09:08.330
I mean, it's just a mess.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.097
Oh, my God.

09:10.097 --> 09:11.297
Duck is tough.

09:11.297 --> 09:12.397
Really tough.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.330
It tastes like it's been
cooked for five days.

09:17.330 --> 09:18.730
It's supposed to be tender.

09:18.730 --> 09:20.464
Tender? It's so cooked
you can't even...

09:20.464 --> 09:22.630
Take the meat off the bone.

09:22.630 --> 09:23.630
Have a taste?

09:25.097 --> 09:26.130
Please.

09:28.130 --> 09:29.230
There's nothing
tender there.

09:29.230 --> 09:30.000
Oh, yeah, it's tough.
Oh, my God.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.797
Oh, yeah, it's tough.
Oh, my God.

09:30.797 --> 09:32.197
It tasted like
the bottom of a shoe.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.797
Hard and rubbery.

09:33.797 --> 09:35.030
I'll move it.
Thanks, darling.

09:35.030 --> 09:36.664
Move it quick.

09:36.664 --> 09:38.230
Mm,.

09:40.064 --> 09:41.864
Oh, my God.

09:41.864 --> 09:42.897
It's tough.

09:42.897 --> 09:44.164
The duck is tough?

09:44.164 --> 09:45.864
Look how tough
the duck is.

09:45.864 --> 09:47.397
You said it's stuffed?
It is stuffed, man.

09:47.397 --> 09:48.697
Cut it! And look.

09:48.697 --> 09:50.930
I put it--
I'm 500 pounds, and look...

09:53.330 --> 09:54.830
It is not tough.
The meat is tough.

09:54.830 --> 09:56.164
I'm hungry,

09:56.164 --> 09:57.730
and I'm gonna
eat 'em up myself.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.130
That's my favorite
dish on the menu.

09:59.130 --> 10:00.000
And that duck
is not going nowhere.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.030
And that duck
is not going nowhere.

10:01.030 --> 10:03.097
This is gonna stay quackin'
on my menu.

10:03.097 --> 10:06.130
I don't give a
if he doesn't like it.

10:06.130 --> 10:08.197
Man, this duck is so
good, man.

10:08.197 --> 10:09.430
Oh, oh!

10:09.430 --> 10:11.064
Oh, my gosh.
Mwah!

10:11.064 --> 10:13.630
Man, look.
That's the skin.

10:13.630 --> 10:15.430
It's stuffed.

10:15.430 --> 10:16.330
Moe doesn't get it.
He doesn't want to listen.

10:16.330 --> 10:17.364
He still think it's standard.

10:19.464 --> 10:20.997
You know what?
I'd like him to come back here

10:20.997 --> 10:22.230
and cook a duck.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.730
And show me how
his duck gonna look like.

10:24.730 --> 10:26.130
We gonna call it
the Gordon duck.

10:30.930 --> 10:32.664
That's gonna be
a British duck right there.

10:34.030 --> 10:35.730
What the hell's
going on in there?

10:37.530 --> 10:39.230
How's it going, chef?

10:39.230 --> 10:40.597
They're laughing.
What's going on in there?

10:40.597 --> 10:42.830
The food's coming back
to the kitchen,

10:42.830 --> 10:44.297
and they think it's a joke.

10:44.297 --> 10:45.764
Um, can I meet the chef?

10:45.764 --> 10:46.764
Absolutely.

10:51.730 --> 10:53.097
Chef Ramsay is clueless.

10:53.097 --> 10:54.530
You know what?

10:54.530 --> 10:55.730
I really don't think
that British can cook, period.

10:55.730 --> 10:57.830
Chef Damon!

10:57.830 --> 10:58.897
Come on.

10:58.897 --> 11:00.000
I need the sous chefs.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.797
I need the sous chefs.

11:00.797 --> 11:02.530
Chef Ramsay needs
to talk to you, please.

11:02.530 --> 11:03.697
Chef Ramsay didn't like
what he ordered.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.064
That's Chef Damon's problem.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.030
It's not a joke at this point.
It's serious.

11:07.030 --> 11:08.464
Damon.
Executive chef?

11:08.464 --> 11:09.497
Yeah.
How long
you been here?

11:09.497 --> 11:10.830
6 1/ 2 months.

11:10.830 --> 11:12.630
I don't know
where to start.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.030
But here's the thing.

11:14.030 --> 11:15.464
The food is embarrassing.

11:17.464 --> 11:18.397
No passion.

11:18.397 --> 11:19.864
No flavor.

11:19.864 --> 11:20.964
The crab cakes.

11:20.964 --> 11:22.597
They weren't made fresh.

11:24.297 --> 11:25.597
Do you freeze crab cakes?

11:25.597 --> 11:26.564
Damon.

11:26.564 --> 11:27.564
No.

11:27.564 --> 11:28.630
You don't freeze them?

11:30.197 --> 11:31.963
Soggy, covered in sauce.

11:31.963 --> 11:33.397
Chef, I would like
to step to this side.

11:33.397 --> 11:34.697
To be on your side,

11:34.697 --> 11:36.397
because they do
freeze the crab cakes.

11:38.663 --> 11:40.297
I had to step
from that line

11:40.297 --> 11:42.497
and go to Chef Ramsay's side.

11:42.497 --> 11:44.463
How he's gonna help us
if you're lying to him?

11:44.463 --> 11:46.197
Why are we lying
to each other here?

11:47.397 --> 11:48.730
Are they frozen?

11:48.730 --> 11:49.797
Yes or not?

11:49.797 --> 11:50.897
Yes.

11:52.130 --> 11:53.130
They are?

11:53.130 --> 11:54.363
Why you want to
lie to me?

11:54.363 --> 11:55.930
I could taste
they're frozen.

11:57.863 --> 11:58.997
'Cause there's
a good reason

11:58.997 --> 12:00.000
why we freeze
the crab cakes.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.663
why we freeze
the crab cakes.

12:00.663 --> 12:03.963
Tell me the good reason
behind freezing the crab cakes.

12:03.963 --> 12:05.097
That we don't have
enough customers in here

12:05.097 --> 12:06.397
to serve the crab cakes.

12:06.397 --> 12:07.863
So the only thing
to prevent them

12:07.863 --> 12:10.130
from going bad is...
to freeze them.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.397
Why make so many?

12:11.397 --> 12:12.897
The batch is big,
basically.

12:12.897 --> 12:14.030
I don't understand this.

12:14.030 --> 12:15.497
Why would you make
a big batch?

12:17.497 --> 12:18.797
Rami... you.

12:18.797 --> 12:21.663
You just sold me out
to  Chef Ramsay.

12:21.663 --> 12:24.097
Damon, when was
the duck cooked?

12:24.097 --> 12:25.763
I can't give you
an answer to that.

12:25.763 --> 12:27.030
Oh, come on.

12:27.030 --> 12:28.530
I mean, what
the--
Don't know.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.000
You don't know when
the duck was cooked?

12:30.000 --> 12:30.230
You don't know when
the duck was cooked?

12:30.230 --> 12:31.330
No.

12:31.330 --> 12:32.797
Do you know
when the duck was cooked?

12:32.797 --> 12:34.263
No, sir, I don't.

12:34.263 --> 12:36.263
Do you know
when the duck was cooked?

12:36.263 --> 12:37.663
Holy!

12:37.663 --> 12:38.897
I know when
the  duck was cooked.

12:38.897 --> 12:39.930
I know.

12:39.930 --> 12:41.530
Well, thank
for that!

12:41.530 --> 12:43.663
Solve the mystery!

12:43.663 --> 12:45.797
We cooked the duck
off the premises.

12:45.797 --> 12:47.630
And we usually cook it
about once a month.

12:47.630 --> 12:50.130
You cook the duck
off the premises?

12:50.130 --> 12:52.297
Yes, in our
commissary kitchen.

12:52.297 --> 12:54.430
And it stays
in the fridge for a month?

12:55.497 --> 12:56.663
Oh,!

12:56.663 --> 12:57.797
Whew.

12:57.797 --> 12:59.430
So you cook the duck...

12:59.430 --> 13:00.000
You freeze it...

13:00.000 --> 13:00.763
You freeze it...

13:00.763 --> 13:02.463
And then you bring it in
like a shipment?

13:02.463 --> 13:04.063
How many times
I gotta  say it?

13:04.063 --> 13:05.230
We cook the  duck--

13:05.230 --> 13:07.363
'Cause I'm
embarrassed!

13:07.363 --> 13:08.697
There's you  me,

13:08.697 --> 13:09.697
'cause you don't
have the

13:09.697 --> 13:11.130
To step up
to the  plate.

13:11.130 --> 13:12.763
Here's me steppin' up
to the  plate.

13:12.763 --> 13:14.097
Good, well tell
the  truth then!

13:14.097 --> 13:15.230
What the  else
do you need to know?

13:15.230 --> 13:16.663
Ask me!

13:22.886 --> 13:24.153
After eating crab cakes

13:24.153 --> 13:26.320
the Chef Ramsay is convinced
are frozen...

13:26.320 --> 13:28.153
Do you freeze
crab cakes?
No.

13:28.153 --> 13:30.320
Head Chef Damon denies it.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.520
But Rami sets
the record straight.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.620
The do freeze
the crab cakes.

13:34.620 --> 13:36.086
Why you wanna
with me?

13:36.086 --> 13:37.720
And Damon has had enough

13:37.720 --> 13:39.086
with the line of questioning.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.986
Here, this is me stepping up
to the  plate.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.420
Good, well, tell
the  truth, then!

13:42.420 --> 13:43.353
What the  else
do you need to know?

13:43.353 --> 13:45.186
The truth!
The truth!

13:45.186 --> 13:46.486
You can't do that!

13:46.486 --> 13:48.620
How  dare you?

13:48.620 --> 13:50.453
You need to chill out.
You cannot do that.

13:50.453 --> 13:50.500
He's here to help us
fix the problem.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.486
He's here to help us
fix the problem.

13:52.486 --> 13:54.120
Do I not deserve

13:54.120 --> 13:55.220
the  truth?

13:55.220 --> 13:56.820
I asked you if it
was frozen, you lied.

13:56.820 --> 13:58.053
I said, "When did you
cook the duck?"

13:58.053 --> 13:59.153
"I don't know."
Why can't we just be honest?

14:00.386 --> 14:02.453
If that's how deluded
you guys are...

14:02.453 --> 14:03.986
That you can't even
tell me the truth.

14:03.986 --> 14:06.020
I'm really sorry.

14:06.020 --> 14:06.920
I'm not here to help
liars,

14:06.920 --> 14:09.053
Let me tell you that.

14:09.053 --> 14:10.186
Do you know what?

14:10.186 --> 14:12.153
I don't even know
where to start.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.486
me.

14:15.486 --> 14:18.853
Chef Ramsay blew up
like a bomb.

14:18.853 --> 14:20.500
This guys just make me feel
like a cockroach right now.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.653
This guys just make me feel
like a cockroach right now.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.953
I just wish that
the  ground

14:23.953 --> 14:25.520
Would just open up
and swallow me.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.820
I have never...

14:28.820 --> 14:30.453
Had my ass chewed up
like this in years.

14:30.453 --> 14:31.853
If he doesn't
like the food,

14:31.853 --> 14:33.386
that means we have
a major problem.

14:33.386 --> 14:34.786
I'm not here to impress him.

14:34.786 --> 14:35.953
I'm here to impress
the thousands of people

14:35.953 --> 14:37.053
that like our food.

14:37.053 --> 14:38.686
You're not getting
the point, chef.

14:38.686 --> 14:40.286
The point is,
the man doesn't like the food.

14:40.286 --> 14:42.020
He's not the only one
who doesn't like the food.

14:42.020 --> 14:43.186
You gotta understand that.

14:43.186 --> 14:44.186
That's a major issue
we having.

14:44.186 --> 14:45.486
But some 's opinion

14:45.486 --> 14:47.020
Who doesn't like
anything that we have,

14:47.020 --> 14:48.920
that's not my fault.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.500
I don't give a
how long a brit's been cooking.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.320
I don't give a
how long a brit's been cooking.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.120
I will whip his ass
in a heartbeat

14:53.120 --> 14:55.053
with the food that we serve
and cook here in New Orleans.

14:55.053 --> 14:57.620
White, English
son of a bitch.

15:03.620 --> 15:05.453
After a tense beginning
to his visit...

15:05.453 --> 15:06.686
Welcome to Oceana.

15:06.686 --> 15:08.186
Oceana opens for dinner...

15:10.620 --> 15:12.553
Giving Chef Ramsay
his first look

15:12.553 --> 15:16.720
at how this Bourbon Street
restaurant operates.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.820
Who told you to put
oil under there?

15:18.820 --> 15:20.220
Uh, Damon...
Who?

15:20.220 --> 15:20.500
The chef.
The chef.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.553
The chef.
The chef.

15:21.553 --> 15:23.786
So you sprayed
the grill with oil.

15:27.553 --> 15:30.386
While Chef Ramsay investigates
the oyster bar...

15:30.386 --> 15:32.153
Got 30 seconds
on your shrimp.

15:32.153 --> 15:33.986
The kitchen is now
sending food out

15:33.986 --> 15:35.653
to the diners.

15:35.653 --> 15:37.986
There's a slight foul taste
to the oyster.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.620
With customers unsatisfied
in the dining room...

15:45.620 --> 15:46.753
It's watered down,

15:46.753 --> 15:48.020
and the shrimp's
kind of mushy.

15:48.020 --> 15:49.453
Okay.

15:49.453 --> 15:50.486
Dish after dish

15:50.486 --> 15:50.500
is being returned
to the kitchen.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.686
is being returned
to the kitchen.

15:53.986 --> 15:55.553
How is it--
how is it bad?

15:55.553 --> 15:57.786
He doesn't like it, doesn't mean
it's that  bad.

15:57.786 --> 15:59.286
I don't care.
What does he want?

15:59.286 --> 16:00.520
Does he want something else?
Doesn't want
nothing else.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.253
That's fine, thanks.

16:02.253 --> 16:03.286
Damn people.

16:03.286 --> 16:05.320
Why it came back?
What happened?

16:05.320 --> 16:08.020
Taste buds.
That's what happened.

16:08.020 --> 16:09.853
Not my  fault
that this problem--

16:09.853 --> 16:11.486
People don't--
"Oh, it's bad food."

16:11.486 --> 16:12.786
I don't give a
about bad food.

16:12.786 --> 16:14.786
I made that recipe.
Ain't bad food.

16:14.786 --> 16:16.220
It's bad opinions.

16:16.220 --> 16:18.220
Chef, every time
somebody complain,

16:18.220 --> 16:20.153
you blame it on them.

16:20.153 --> 16:20.500
Instead of fixing
the problem.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.520
Instead of fixing
the problem.

16:21.520 --> 16:22.853
Chef...

16:23.953 --> 16:25.486
This is a hot cupboard?

16:25.486 --> 16:26.753
Uh, a warmer unit.
Yes, sir.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.120
It's not even hot.

16:29.953 --> 16:31.520
What the
is that?

16:31.520 --> 16:32.786
Gumbo crabs.

16:32.786 --> 16:34.186
The crabs are all milky.

16:34.186 --> 16:36.620
You're holding it
at barely room temperature,

16:36.620 --> 16:39.486
the most dangerous
position to be at.

16:39.486 --> 16:41.620
Get me your brother
a minute, will you, please?

16:41.620 --> 16:43.253
It's, uh,
the executive chef job

16:43.253 --> 16:45.453
to make sure
everything is rotated.

16:45.453 --> 16:46.620
And he's not doing
what he's supposed to do.

16:46.620 --> 16:48.520
Look! It's cracked.
It's split.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.053
It's bubbling.

16:50.053 --> 16:50.500
'Cause it means...
It's sour.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.620
'Cause it means...
It's sour.

16:51.620 --> 16:53.153
- It's sour!
- It's  sour.

16:53.153 --> 16:55.053
Hold on, look.
Look at the color of the crabs.

16:55.053 --> 16:56.686
You gotta be
kidding me.

16:56.686 --> 16:57.820
They're not even hot.

16:57.820 --> 16:59.386
I'm too disgusted
to touch them.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.053
I don't have  time
to come back here

17:01.053 --> 17:02.786
And check on that--
that's your  job!

17:02.786 --> 17:04.153
Hate just to look
at this

17:04.153 --> 17:05.886
and know, oh, my God,

17:05.886 --> 17:07.553
is this what's going on
in my business?

17:07.553 --> 17:08.720
What's this?

17:08.720 --> 17:10.553
Ohh,.

17:10.553 --> 17:11.920
Ooh.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.686
Oh, my...

17:26.886 --> 17:27.953
How old are they?

17:27.953 --> 17:29.786
I don't know.

17:31.686 --> 17:34.086
Just smell them.

17:34.086 --> 17:35.353
Smell them.

17:35.353 --> 17:36.953
Ohh!

17:36.953 --> 17:39.120
The smell was like, "Agh!"

17:39.120 --> 17:41.486
I had no idea...

17:41.486 --> 17:44.920
Chef Damon was doing
such a  job.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.586
Look at the color of them!

17:47.586 --> 17:49.820
Ooh!.

17:49.820 --> 17:50.500
All this
is tarnished now.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.720
All this
is tarnished now.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.953
The whole  lot
is tainted!

17:54.520 --> 17:56.153
It's just...unacceptable.

17:56.153 --> 17:57.286
I mean, Chef Damon
should know better.

17:57.286 --> 17:58.486
He's an executive chef.

17:58.486 --> 18:01.453
What the
is going on here?

18:01.453 --> 18:03.820
We do boil crawfish
here in New Orleans.

18:03.820 --> 18:06.720
But...they're gone.
On their last legs.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.753
If they didn't get done
by this evening,

18:08.753 --> 18:10.153
we have an entire day
tomorrow

18:10.153 --> 18:11.253
that we can devote

18:11.253 --> 18:12.686
to prepping the things
that are going--

18:12.686 --> 18:13.986
so you got time tomorrow...

18:13.986 --> 18:14.986
We'll toss it.

18:14.986 --> 18:16.286
You'll toss it?

18:16.286 --> 18:18.220
And all that pasta?
When was that cooked?

18:18.220 --> 18:20.500
This morning.
We did pasta this morning.

18:20.500 --> 18:20.753
This morning.
We did pasta this morning.

18:20.753 --> 18:22.353
Today.

18:23.953 --> 18:25.953
So when was
all this one cooked?

18:25.953 --> 18:27.186
Yesterday?

18:27.186 --> 18:28.320
Yeah.
What?

18:28.320 --> 18:30.353
I'm trying to help you
to understand

18:30.353 --> 18:31.420
the method
in your madness.

18:31.420 --> 18:32.720
,
I'm not the one

18:32.720 --> 18:34.386
Who just said
it was done yesterday.

18:34.386 --> 18:35.720
I asked my prep--

18:35.720 --> 18:38.653
you can call me a
all you want.

18:38.653 --> 18:40.086
So get  angry
with me.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.086
You're standing right here,

18:41.086 --> 18:43.386
hearing me ask
the person who knows,

18:43.386 --> 18:45.220
and I gave you his answer,
not mine.

18:45.220 --> 18:47.320
Who's the  chef
in here?

18:47.320 --> 18:48.720
I am.

18:48.720 --> 18:49.886
Right.

18:49.886 --> 18:50.500
Bags of jambalaya
in the fridge, warm.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.786
Bags of jambalaya
in the fridge, warm.

18:53.786 --> 18:55.286
Have you any idea
what happens to jambalaya

18:55.286 --> 18:56.953
in the fridge when it's
still warm in the center?

18:56.953 --> 18:57.953
Grows the bacteria.

18:57.953 --> 18:58.953
Grows the bacteria.

19:01.020 --> 19:03.553
And how many crabs
are you selling, chef,

19:03.553 --> 19:07.386
over the next
three months?

19:07.386 --> 19:09.453
Loss for words?
Really?!

19:09.453 --> 19:12.320
That's another box
of crab cakes.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.020
Wait, when were these made?

19:14.020 --> 19:17.653
No date, you see...Chef.

19:17.653 --> 19:18.586
There was nothin'
but dollar sign

19:18.586 --> 19:19.886
going through my mind.

19:19.886 --> 19:20.500
Soft shell crab, jambalaya,

19:20.500 --> 19:22.420
Soft shell crab, jambalaya,

19:22.420 --> 19:23.620
crawfish,.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.753
Straight down the garbage.

19:25.753 --> 19:27.653
Chef Damon basically
just took the money

19:27.653 --> 19:29.753
right out of our pocket.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.220
I don't know when you think

19:31.220 --> 19:34.286
you should be taking out
containers...

19:34.286 --> 19:38.020
And sort of cleaning out
your fridge from time to time.

19:38.020 --> 19:40.086
One  question
to you.

19:40.086 --> 19:42.186
Who's a  now, Chef?

19:42.186 --> 19:45.253
I am.

19:45.253 --> 19:47.286
I didn't come in here
to humiliate you.

19:47.286 --> 19:48.720
But how dare you

19:48.720 --> 19:50.500
serve me food

19:50.500 --> 19:51.120
serve me food

19:51.120 --> 19:52.520
from this disgusting fridge?

19:52.520 --> 19:55.920
And stand there
and call me an , Chef?

19:57.420 --> 19:58.720
'Scuse me.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.386
Chef.

20:02.386 --> 20:04.086
Oh, my  God.

20:04.086 --> 20:07.820
Ho-ho-how long
has this been going on?

20:07.820 --> 20:10.153
It's barely 30 minutes
into dinner service...

20:10.153 --> 20:11.720
I don't like it.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.553
The dining room
is full of customers

20:13.553 --> 20:14.786
unhappy with
their entrees.

20:14.786 --> 20:16.320
There is a pickle
in her red beans.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.320
And back in the kitchen...

20:18.320 --> 20:20.500
Chef Ramsay's frightening
investigation continues.

20:20.500 --> 20:20.786
Chef Ramsay's frightening
investigation continues.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.086
What's that in there?

20:23.953 --> 20:25.853
That's for the...
Roaches, Chef.

20:25.853 --> 20:27.353
Roaches?
Yes, Chef.

20:27.353 --> 20:28.653
That's--that's not
for the roaches.

20:28.653 --> 20:29.653
That's for the mice.

20:29.653 --> 20:31.020
Mice?

20:32.753 --> 20:34.386
And are they in there?

20:34.386 --> 20:35.686
No, Chef.
No?

20:41.086 --> 20:42.420
You see that?

20:44.253 --> 20:46.020
Three dead mice.

20:47.820 --> 20:48.953
Ohh.

20:51.220 --> 20:52.353
Ohh.

21:02.089 --> 21:03.689
After finding a great deal
of old food

21:03.689 --> 21:04.722
in Oceana's kitchen...

21:04.722 --> 21:05.922
The crabs are all milky.

21:05.922 --> 21:07.289
Look at the color of them.

21:09.189 --> 21:12.589
Chef Ramsay now makes
another horrifying discovery.

21:12.589 --> 21:13.955
Three dead mice.

21:13.955 --> 21:15.055
Ohh.

21:22.289 --> 21:24.289
Enough is enough, yeah?

21:24.289 --> 21:26.255
We cannot continue

21:26.255 --> 21:28.955
serving food like this.

21:31.022 --> 21:32.255
Shut it down!

21:33.455 --> 21:34.489
Quickly.

21:37.255 --> 21:39.222
Am I dreaming?
It's just unreal.

21:39.222 --> 21:42.389
I have never, ever
shut a restaurant down

21:42.389 --> 21:43.722
in my life.

21:43.722 --> 21:44.789
Shut it down.

21:44.789 --> 21:47.089
But, hey,
we have an emergency,

21:47.089 --> 21:48.322
and we have to do
what we need to do.

21:48.322 --> 21:50.589
Shut it down.
Shut down the restaurant.

21:50.589 --> 21:53.689
Three dead mice, yeah?

21:53.689 --> 21:55.122
I got three
blind mice.

21:55.122 --> 21:57.589
One chef
and two  owners.

21:57.589 --> 21:59.492
We had an emergency and
we had to shut down the kitchen.

21:59.492 --> 21:59.555
We had an emergency and
we had to shut down the kitchen.

21:59.555 --> 22:02.822
And I do apologize
about that.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.122
Chef, we just
got shut down.

22:05.122 --> 22:06.889
Are you all happy?

22:06.889 --> 22:08.289
Shut it down.

22:08.289 --> 22:10.222
I lost a lot of money tonight
by shutting down.

22:10.222 --> 22:11.655
Come on, let's start
cleaning up!

22:11.655 --> 22:12.555
You're all standing
looking at me crazy!

22:12.555 --> 22:13.655
Come on, let's go!

22:13.655 --> 22:14.722
I didn't have
any other option.

22:14.722 --> 22:15.955
The place is filthy.

22:15.955 --> 22:18.022
With the restaurant now empty,

22:18.022 --> 22:20.489
Chef Ramsay gets
some expert help

22:20.489 --> 22:22.489
to deal with
the rodent problem.

22:22.489 --> 22:24.022
Thank you for coming.

22:24.022 --> 22:26.055
And as the exterminators
get to work

22:26.055 --> 22:27.055
getting rid of the mice...

22:27.055 --> 22:29.492
Whoa, whoa!

22:29.492 --> 22:29.589
Whoa, whoa!

22:29.589 --> 22:31.822
Chef Ramsay takes
a closer look

22:31.822 --> 22:33.522
at what else
needs to be cleaned

22:33.522 --> 22:34.822
in the kitchen.

22:34.822 --> 22:35.822
Look at that in there.

22:35.822 --> 22:38.089
Oh, my God.

22:41.389 --> 22:43.655
I'm looking at some stuff,
I'm like, what the hell is this?

22:43.655 --> 22:45.355
Everything's greasy.
Everything's sticky.

22:45.355 --> 22:48.022
Disgusting.

22:48.022 --> 22:49.022
When was the last time

22:49.022 --> 22:50.289
you came in
and actually had

22:50.289 --> 22:51.889
a proper clean
from top to bottom?

22:51.889 --> 22:53.589
Never.

22:53.589 --> 22:54.889
Never?
Never.

22:57.855 --> 22:59.492
Get it clean, guys, yeah?
Top to bottom, yeah?

22:59.492 --> 22:59.889
Get it clean, guys, yeah?
Top to bottom, yeah?

22:59.889 --> 23:03.022
That's fine.
That's what we're geared up for.

23:05.122 --> 23:06.455
I want everybody
bustin' their ass.

23:06.455 --> 23:08.555
I'm not trying to stay here
for another two months.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.289
I want this place clean
tonight!

23:13.222 --> 23:14.922
You take  fall

23:14.922 --> 23:17.422
Because of half of the
that is going on right now.

23:17.422 --> 23:19.655
It's Chef Damon
and it's my brother Rami.

23:19.655 --> 23:21.522
And both of them
are responsible for this.

23:21.522 --> 23:22.622
Just listen, man--

23:22.622 --> 23:23.789
you're the one
who was supposed to be

23:23.789 --> 23:25.322
over the  kitchen!

23:25.322 --> 23:26.489
You're the one who's
supposed to be over this,

23:26.489 --> 23:29.322
supervising his!

23:29.322 --> 23:29.492
Now you making everybody
look like.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.622
Now you making everybody
look like.

23:31.622 --> 23:33.889
Because you're not here
on top of your job.

23:33.889 --> 23:35.655
Moe doesn't want
to take the blame?

23:35.655 --> 23:37.055
I'm not gonna
take the blame anymore.

23:37.055 --> 23:39.355
That's one thing I do know.

23:39.355 --> 23:40.455
It's a combination
of everybody

23:40.455 --> 23:41.955
not doing what
they supposed to do.

23:41.955 --> 23:42.922
Are you finished, big boy?

23:42.922 --> 23:44.022
why I'm finished.

23:44.022 --> 23:45.255
why I'm finished.

23:45.255 --> 23:46.322
Moe doesn't want to hear it.

23:46.322 --> 23:47.522
He just keep going crazy.

23:47.522 --> 23:50.055
He's gonna lose it,
you know?

23:53.322 --> 23:54.889
Bl-bluh!

23:54.889 --> 23:56.289
Wowee.

23:57.889 --> 23:59.492
What are y'all doing,
sitting down doing nothing?

23:59.492 --> 24:00.055
What are y'all doing,
sitting down doing nothing?

24:00.055 --> 24:03.022
What are y'all doing?
What are y'all doing?

24:03.022 --> 24:05.955
I need this  place
scrubbed down, top to bottom!

24:05.955 --> 24:08.622
I want the TVs wiped!
I want the piano wiped!

24:08.622 --> 24:10.589
I want this place clean!

24:10.589 --> 24:12.655
What part don't you
understand?

24:12.655 --> 24:14.689
We just shut down
the  restaurant!

24:14.689 --> 24:18.222
Tonight! Nobody seems
to get that!

24:18.222 --> 24:19.222
Clean this  mess!

24:26.355 --> 24:28.122
Let me get a  shot.

24:28.122 --> 24:29.422
I can't take
this  anymore.

24:36.655 --> 24:39.355
Moe is acting an ass
right now.

24:39.355 --> 24:41.722
Hurricane Moe...
Shh...

24:41.722 --> 24:43.489
I'm just trying to stay
out his way

24:43.489 --> 24:45.055
and clean up his nasty-ass
restaurant

24:45.055 --> 24:47.789
so I could go home.

24:47.789 --> 24:50.655
Today was a wake-up call
for us.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.055
The person running
the kitchen

24:52.055 --> 24:54.322
is not up to his job.

24:54.322 --> 24:55.322
Right.

24:55.322 --> 24:56.255
He's made a lot of damages

24:56.255 --> 24:58.189
to this restaurant.

24:58.189 --> 24:59.492
And we're gonna have
to tell him he has to go.

24:59.492 --> 25:00.722
And we're gonna have
to tell him he has to go.

25:00.722 --> 25:03.622
Yeah, this decision should have
been made a long time ago.

25:03.622 --> 25:05.322
Can you please go
get Chef Damon?

25:09.555 --> 25:11.889
It was always my suggestion

25:11.889 --> 25:13.589
that we have
to let Chef Damon go.

25:13.589 --> 25:16.922
But, uh, Moe always thought
that he can do the job.

25:16.922 --> 25:18.589
Finally he realize that

25:18.589 --> 25:19.789
that's not
the right guy for us.

25:19.789 --> 25:22.122
Today was a wakeup call
for me.

25:22.122 --> 25:25.022
Chef Ramsay came here
and he went to the back

25:25.022 --> 25:27.922
and he pointed all the bad
things that were going on.

25:27.922 --> 25:29.492
Right now, I feel like
you are part of this problem.

25:29.492 --> 25:30.589
Right now, I feel like
you are part of this problem.

25:32.189 --> 25:34.755
How can you not know
that you're not supposed

25:34.755 --> 25:37.255
to put the jambalaya
while it's hot in the walk-in?

25:37.255 --> 25:38.755
How can you not know that?

25:38.755 --> 25:40.222
You're the executive chef.

25:40.222 --> 25:41.922
How can you
not know that?
I do.

25:41.922 --> 25:43.189
Can you explain?
I didn't do it.

25:43.189 --> 25:44.255
Our prep people did it.

25:44.255 --> 25:45.689
I didn't realize
they had done it,

25:45.689 --> 25:48.122
and I've...
coached them repeatedly

25:48.122 --> 25:49.322
to not do that.

25:49.322 --> 25:51.855
Chef...the problem is...

25:51.855 --> 25:53.155
excuses.

25:53.155 --> 25:55.422
Every time I tell you
we have an issue,

25:55.422 --> 25:58.022
you just hit me with
nothing but excuses.

25:58.022 --> 25:59.492
And I'm at a point
where I cannot afford

25:59.492 --> 26:00.389
And I'm at a point
where I cannot afford

26:00.389 --> 26:02.289
to take any excuses.

26:02.289 --> 26:03.722
Do you understand that?

26:03.722 --> 26:06.022
Do you understand
we cannot afford

26:06.022 --> 26:07.589
to have any more
ups!

26:07.589 --> 26:10.589
Today, we've lost
about five grand!

26:10.589 --> 26:13.589
We shut down
the restaurant tonight

26:13.589 --> 26:15.122
because of
the kitchen issues!

26:15.122 --> 26:16.589
Do you understand that?

26:16.589 --> 26:18.789
It's a problem.

26:18.789 --> 26:21.155
And right now, you're the one
who caused the problem.

26:21.155 --> 26:22.322
Do you understand that?

26:23.755 --> 26:25.422
Today, I made the decision.

26:25.422 --> 26:27.722
With all due respect, Chef,

26:27.722 --> 26:29.492
today is your last day
at the restaurant.

26:29.492 --> 26:30.989
today is your last day
at the restaurant.

26:30.989 --> 26:32.389
Thank you.

26:36.055 --> 26:37.089
Thanks, Chef.

26:51.414 --> 26:53.914
After witnessing one of
the worst kitchens

26:53.914 --> 26:55.714
he has ever seen,

26:55.714 --> 26:57.647
Chef Ramsay returns
the next morning

26:57.647 --> 26:59.881
to inspect the state
of the restaurant.

26:59.881 --> 27:02.281
This restaurant
is actually clean today.

27:03.715 --> 27:04.981
Make sure that's dry

27:04.981 --> 27:05.915
Before you get any oil
in there, yeah?

27:05.915 --> 27:07.115
Look this.

27:07.115 --> 27:09.148
I feel like sleeping on it.

27:09.148 --> 27:11.948
And Moe and Rami
have some important news

27:11.948 --> 27:13.015
to share with Chef Ramsay.

27:13.015 --> 27:16.048
I fired Chef Damon
officially yesterday.

27:16.048 --> 27:16.472
Yeah, any chef
of his own mind

27:16.472 --> 27:17.448
Yeah, any chef
of his own mind

27:17.448 --> 27:19.748
would have gracefully
handed the towel in.

27:19.748 --> 27:21.648
And resigned.

27:21.648 --> 27:23.015
Right, moving forward.

27:23.015 --> 27:24.181
I'm gonna do some work
in the kitchen.

27:24.181 --> 27:27.448
Do you have any recipes
on pen and paper?

27:27.448 --> 27:28.781
Right here.

27:28.781 --> 27:29.715
What?

27:29.715 --> 27:30.748
Right here.

27:31.781 --> 27:33.581
So why aren't they
on paper?

27:33.581 --> 27:35.115
Why haven't we got
a database?

27:35.115 --> 27:37.181
I like to keep
my recipes secret.

27:37.181 --> 27:38.648
If I put them
on a piece of paper,

27:38.648 --> 27:40.481
I don't want
somebody to steal them.

27:40.481 --> 27:42.648
Oh,.

27:42.648 --> 27:44.548
So...

27:44.548 --> 27:46.472
You're worried that
somebody gets the recipe

27:46.472 --> 27:46.815
You're worried that
somebody gets the recipe

27:46.815 --> 27:47.781
and copies it?

27:47.781 --> 27:49.348
Anybody change my recipe,

27:49.348 --> 27:50.415
I'm gonna kill 'em.

27:50.415 --> 27:51.515
It's my recipe.

27:51.515 --> 27:52.615
Rami, help me out here
will you?

27:52.615 --> 27:53.681
Is this for real?

27:53.681 --> 27:55.548
That's what we deal with
every day, chef.

27:57.048 --> 27:59.448
You think it's funny,
but believe what I tell you.

27:59.448 --> 28:00.781
I don't think it's funny.

28:00.781 --> 28:01.948
You're just
a little bit deluded.

28:01.948 --> 28:04.481
Well, you know what,
the recipes are in my head.

28:04.481 --> 28:05.715
Are you stupid?

28:05.715 --> 28:06.915
I am not stupid.

28:06.915 --> 28:08.348
Moe, you are stupid.

28:08.348 --> 28:09.648
The kitchen
absolutely doesn't know

28:09.648 --> 28:11.415
what the  they cook
because the recipe

28:11.415 --> 28:13.615
is in Moe's head--
it's crazy.

28:13.615 --> 28:15.581
Don't call me stupid
in my  restaurant.

28:15.581 --> 28:16.472
Do you understand
that you need

28:16.472 --> 28:16.781
Do you understand
that you need

28:16.781 --> 28:18.115
to learn how
to talk to people?

28:18.115 --> 28:19.981
This is New Orleans!
You understand?

28:19.981 --> 28:21.281
Wow.

28:21.281 --> 28:22.748
This is New Orleans.

28:22.748 --> 28:24.215
Don't  come down here
talkin' to us like that!

28:24.215 --> 28:25.748
Calm down.
I have never

28:25.748 --> 28:27.548
been chewed up
like you chewed me up.

28:27.548 --> 28:28.681
Right.
Never!

28:28.681 --> 28:30.315
We got nothin' but swamps
around here.

28:30.315 --> 28:31.681
Anybody talks like that

28:31.681 --> 28:34.381
gets chopped up and fed
to the  alligators.

28:35.581 --> 28:37.015
I'm not here

28:37.015 --> 28:38.081
to blow smoke
up your  ass.

28:38.081 --> 28:39.415
Let me tell you that.

28:39.415 --> 28:41.015
I'm here to fix
this restaurant.

28:41.015 --> 28:42.848
But you are one obstacle,
aren't you?

28:42.848 --> 28:45.081
No, I'm a easy-goin' guy.

28:45.081 --> 28:46.472
I listen.
I work hard.

28:46.472 --> 28:47.048
I listen.
I work hard.

28:47.048 --> 28:50.348
But you're a...
busy idiot.

28:50.348 --> 28:51.548
I don't think he gets it

28:51.548 --> 28:53.281
that he needs
to watch his language.

28:53.281 --> 28:54.581
But you're not getting

28:54.581 --> 28:56.148
that he's here
to help us.

28:56.148 --> 28:57.315
I'm not calling him
an idiot.

28:57.315 --> 28:58.715
He's calling me
an idiot.

28:58.715 --> 29:00.148
A busy idiot.

29:00.148 --> 29:01.248
A busy idiot.

29:01.248 --> 29:02.581
You're working hard
in the wrong places.

29:02.581 --> 29:04.048
What am I--I--
I mean, I feel like

29:04.048 --> 29:05.548
flipping this
table right now.

29:05.548 --> 29:06.915
Did you hear
what he just said?

29:06.915 --> 29:08.448
He just explained it.
He just told you.

29:08.448 --> 29:10.315
You're working hard
in the wrong places.

29:10.315 --> 29:12.048
Busy idiot!
Is he kidding me?

29:12.048 --> 29:15.148
I will stand up,
beat the  out of him,

29:15.148 --> 29:16.472
And show him
who the  idiot is.

29:16.472 --> 29:18.281
And show him
who the  idiot is.

29:18.281 --> 29:19.881
What is it you want?
A fight?

29:23.815 --> 29:26.215
My problem is...
Flip the table?

29:26.215 --> 29:27.948
I want to make
this restaurant successful.

29:27.948 --> 29:29.015
That's my problem.
Okay.

29:29.015 --> 29:30.581
So do I.

29:30.581 --> 29:32.215
I'm here to help.

29:32.215 --> 29:34.481
I don't want to see you
running around killing yourself,

29:34.481 --> 29:35.748
like a busy idiot.

29:35.748 --> 29:37.281
I've just gone over
the fact

29:37.281 --> 29:39.081
that we haven't got
any recipes on paper,

29:39.081 --> 29:40.815
and all in your head.

29:40.815 --> 29:42.215
You're worried about
writing them down

29:42.215 --> 29:43.715
for some other chef
copying them

29:43.715 --> 29:46.015
and making their restaurants
more successful than yours.

29:46.015 --> 29:46.472
I'm in the real world.

29:46.472 --> 29:47.715
I'm in the real world.

29:47.715 --> 29:49.348
That's where I am.

29:49.348 --> 29:51.315
You're treating me like
one of your  staff.

29:51.315 --> 29:52.848
Well, let me
tell you,Moe,

29:52.848 --> 29:54.215
I'm not a member
of your staff.

29:54.215 --> 29:56.148
Flip the table,
punch me,

29:56.148 --> 29:58.048
do what the
you wanna do.

29:58.048 --> 29:59.815
But don't  with me.

30:01.315 --> 30:02.681
Got it?

30:02.681 --> 30:04.248
Got it.
Thank you.

30:04.248 --> 30:05.848
See you later.

30:08.548 --> 30:11.548
He's not understanding
that this guy

30:11.548 --> 30:13.748
can make a difference
in our life.

30:13.748 --> 30:15.415
He's British.

30:15.415 --> 30:16.472
Busy idiot over there

30:16.472 --> 30:16.881
Busy idiot over there

30:16.881 --> 30:18.881
means something
total different over here.

30:18.881 --> 30:21.015
A busy idiot, I think,
is a good thing.

30:21.015 --> 30:23.415
That means you working hard
in the wrong places.

30:23.415 --> 30:24.981
Busy idiot is a complement?

30:24.981 --> 30:26.248
It's a complement.

30:26.248 --> 30:28.415
He's from British.
He doesn't speak English.

30:28.415 --> 30:30.415
I know busy idiot
is not a complement,

30:30.415 --> 30:32.348
but I had to calm Moe down.

30:32.348 --> 30:33.681
Well, he needs
to understand

30:33.681 --> 30:36.548
that busy idiot
in America is an insult.

30:36.548 --> 30:38.215
Okay, busy idiot
is a good thing.

30:38.215 --> 30:39.881
I had to tell him
it's a complement

30:39.881 --> 30:41.981
so we can move on,
because other than that,

30:41.981 --> 30:44.215
he's gonna keep on
going at it with Chef Ramsay

30:44.215 --> 30:45.615
and we're not
gonna go nowhere.

30:45.615 --> 30:46.472
Let's say
we move on?

30:46.472 --> 30:47.415
Let's say
we move on?

30:48.881 --> 30:50.615
We can move on.
Okay.

30:50.615 --> 30:52.048
Like, you know what?

30:52.048 --> 30:53.681
I should have brought
a  British dictionary.

30:53.681 --> 30:55.648
I've--it took me
a long  time

30:55.648 --> 30:56.881
To learn my language.

30:56.881 --> 30:58.081
How long
is it gonna take me--

30:58.081 --> 30:59.048
I mean, that's
the last thing I want,

30:59.048 --> 31:00.781
just to learn  British.

31:02.248 --> 31:03.548
Without any recipes
to look over...

31:03.548 --> 31:04.915
What I'm gonna do
is a very simple,

31:04.915 --> 31:06.348
fresh, blackened salmon.

31:06.348 --> 31:07.915
Chef Ramsay jumps
into the kitchen

31:07.915 --> 31:09.748
and begins to work
with the staff

31:09.748 --> 31:11.648
on revamping their menu.

31:11.648 --> 31:12.981
Squeeze of fresh lime on top.

31:12.981 --> 31:14.915
Beautiful, baked.

31:14.915 --> 31:16.181
Sweet potato mash.

31:16.181 --> 31:16.472
Chef Ramsay was here,
and he was on that stove

31:16.472 --> 31:18.015
Chef Ramsay was here,
and he was on that stove

31:18.015 --> 31:19.481
like, cookin';
I was like, ooh!

31:19.481 --> 31:21.115
All right, chef,
what's goin' on?

31:21.115 --> 31:22.515
I was just blown away.

31:22.515 --> 31:25.148
And finished off
with a little Streusel, yeah?

31:25.148 --> 31:26.715
Wonderful.

31:26.715 --> 31:28.615
After a number of conflicts
with Moe,

31:28.615 --> 31:31.181
Chef Ramsay wants to make sure
that both brothers

31:31.181 --> 31:33.581
are completely on board
with the changes

31:33.581 --> 31:35.381
he's about to implement.

31:35.381 --> 31:36.381
Okay, listen to me.

31:36.381 --> 31:38.881
This place is broken.

31:38.881 --> 31:40.781
And it needs
a massive overhaul.

31:40.781 --> 31:42.015
Rapidly.

31:42.015 --> 31:43.048
I am prepared

31:43.048 --> 31:44.181
to come up
with solutions,

31:44.181 --> 31:45.848
work my  off.

31:45.848 --> 31:46.472
However,

31:46.472 --> 31:47.115
However,

31:47.115 --> 31:49.015
I will not go forward

31:49.015 --> 31:50.915
unless you are prepared

31:50.915 --> 31:53.015
to accept my changes.

31:54.815 --> 31:56.048
I'm prepared.

32:00.848 --> 32:03.381
So basically,
you're gonna change

32:03.381 --> 32:06.715
whatever the
you want to change

32:06.715 --> 32:09.315
and I don't have the right
to say a word to it?

32:09.315 --> 32:11.281
Correct.

32:17.415 --> 32:18.415
You know what?

32:18.415 --> 32:20.515
Yes. I agree.

32:20.515 --> 32:22.315
I feel like I'm ready
to cooperate right now.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.148
Good.
I'm pleased to hear it.

32:25.281 --> 32:26.348
I'm gonna...

32:29.548 --> 32:31.515
Shut my  mouth.

32:31.515 --> 32:34.015
Because, obviously,
my way is not working.

32:34.015 --> 32:36.181
So I'm gonna let Chef Ramsay
handle it

32:36.181 --> 32:40.215
and I'm just gonna be
100% cooperative.

32:40.215 --> 32:42.348
Good night.
Good night, chef.

32:44.081 --> 32:45.348
I don't want a hug
from you.

32:45.348 --> 32:46.472
Thank you.

32:46.472 --> 32:48.815
Thank you.

32:48.815 --> 32:51.148
I'm about to kiss this
restaurant good-bye,

32:51.148 --> 32:53.048
Because I may
come back tomorrow,

32:53.048 --> 32:56.781
and not see it
where it's at right now.

32:58.715 --> 33:00.248
My God.

33:00.248 --> 33:01.615
Agh.

33:02.981 --> 33:06.248
Listen, man,
it just hit me real hard.

33:06.248 --> 33:07.448
Did we just agree with him

33:07.448 --> 33:09.348
to change whatever
he's gonna change?

33:09.348 --> 33:10.548
Yes, we're good.
Let's go home.

33:10.548 --> 33:12.248
Go get you some rest.

33:24.848 --> 33:26.914
After Moe and Rami confirm

33:26.914 --> 33:28.481
that they were willing
to accept change...

33:28.481 --> 33:30.914
Oh, my God,
my stomach is flipping.

33:30.914 --> 33:33.348
Chef Ramsay had his team
work through the night,

33:33.348 --> 33:35.281
transforming Oceana.

33:37.081 --> 33:38.214
Whew.

33:38.214 --> 33:39.214
Okay, good morning!

33:39.214 --> 33:41.647
- Chef, good morning!
- Oh,.

33:41.647 --> 33:43.114
I told Chef Ramsay

33:43.114 --> 33:45.181
That I'm gonna do
whatever he says,

33:45.181 --> 33:46.914
but if I don't like
the changes,

33:46.914 --> 33:49.514
I will send him back to British
with a black eye.

33:49.514 --> 33:50.581
Excited?

33:50.581 --> 33:51.466
Very excited.

33:51.466 --> 33:52.247
Very excited.

33:52.247 --> 33:53.314
Moe, are you ready
to see your new restaurant?

33:54.747 --> 33:56.581
Wow. Okay.

33:56.581 --> 33:59.414
Take your blindfolds off.

33:59.414 --> 34:00.381
Oh, wow.
Oh, my God.

34:00.381 --> 34:02.014
It's beautiful.

34:02.014 --> 34:03.014
Oh, my God.

34:03.014 --> 34:04.514
Look at the marble bar.

34:04.514 --> 34:07.014
Welcome to a classy,
unique feel.

34:07.014 --> 34:08.681
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

34:08.681 --> 34:10.147
Custom artwork.

34:10.147 --> 34:11.081
New marble.

34:11.081 --> 34:12.581
The chandeliers.

34:12.581 --> 34:15.481
It oozes New Orleans.
Beautiful.

34:15.481 --> 34:16.881
You're no longer
in a fish bowl.

34:16.881 --> 34:19.647
We've de-cluttered
the entrance.

34:19.647 --> 34:21.466
Now it feels spacious
and welcoming.

34:21.466 --> 34:21.847
Now it feels spacious
and welcoming.

34:21.847 --> 34:23.181
Let's go into
the other dining room.

34:23.181 --> 34:24.147
Look at this.

34:24.147 --> 34:25.647
Oh, my God.

34:25.647 --> 34:26.581
Whoa.
Wow.

34:26.581 --> 34:27.614
Beautiful.

34:27.614 --> 34:28.747
It looks huge!

34:28.747 --> 34:29.681
Doesn't it?

34:29.681 --> 34:30.714
We've painted it.

34:30.714 --> 34:31.714
The pots have gone.

34:31.714 --> 34:33.414
The sign has gone.

34:33.414 --> 34:35.881
So both dining rooms
look connected.

34:35.881 --> 34:36.947
Wow.

34:36.947 --> 34:39.114
It looks like
one restaurant.

34:39.114 --> 34:40.214
Very happy, chef.

34:40.214 --> 34:42.014
I've been waiting
for this moment,

34:42.014 --> 34:43.447
and it finally happened.

34:43.447 --> 34:46.614
The whole place looked
like one restaurant.

34:46.614 --> 34:49.347
And hopefully,
Moe's gonna like it.

34:49.347 --> 34:50.914
You happy, Moe?

34:53.081 --> 34:54.614
Oh, man.
This is great.

34:54.614 --> 34:55.947
I mean,

34:55.947 --> 34:57.481
I am speechless.

34:57.481 --> 34:59.147
Good!

34:59.147 --> 35:00.047
I love it
when you're speechless.

35:00.047 --> 35:01.714
I'm so excited right now,

35:01.714 --> 35:04.447
I'm feelin' like
a proud  tiger.

35:04.447 --> 35:06.781
I can't wait till
everybody comes here

35:06.781 --> 35:09.314
and check this out.

35:09.314 --> 35:11.647
While the decor has been
embraced by the brothers,

35:11.647 --> 35:13.547
It's time for Chef Ramsay
to introduce

35:13.547 --> 35:16.447
The menu.

35:16.447 --> 35:18.081
All right, let's start off
down at the end.

35:18.081 --> 35:20.814
Seafood gumbo.
That is absolutely stunning.

35:20.814 --> 35:21.466
A nice, fresh crab cake,

35:21.466 --> 35:22.814
A nice, fresh crab cake,

35:22.814 --> 35:23.914
heated with a Tabasco.

35:23.914 --> 35:25.147
We've got the jambalaya.

35:25.147 --> 35:27.581
You have chicken,
sausage, and shrimp.

35:27.581 --> 35:29.381
This is the real
jambalaya.

35:29.381 --> 35:30.381
That looks good.

35:30.381 --> 35:31.347
Blackened duck.

35:31.347 --> 35:32.381
Mm-mmm.

35:32.381 --> 35:33.547
Served with dirty rice

35:33.547 --> 35:34.814
and wild mushrooms.

35:34.814 --> 35:35.981
Is this my new duck?

35:35.981 --> 35:38.114
That is your new duck.

35:38.114 --> 35:39.114
Dive in.

35:41.081 --> 35:42.347
It's delicious.
Wow.

35:42.347 --> 35:43.414
Mmm.

35:43.414 --> 35:44.981
That duck
is outstanding.

35:44.981 --> 35:47.047
I'm gonna have to divorce
my old duck.

35:48.547 --> 35:51.047
This is the best food
I've ever seen.

35:51.047 --> 35:51.466
I really cannot wait
tonight till we open,

35:51.466 --> 35:53.081
I really cannot wait
tonight till we open,

35:53.081 --> 35:54.747
bring the people in,

35:54.747 --> 35:56.947
and give 'em
a taste of New Orleans.

35:56.947 --> 35:58.047
That's what I'm
talkin' about.

36:01.347 --> 36:03.514
It's just moments
away from relaunch,

36:03.514 --> 36:05.481
and everyone seems
ready to go.

36:05.481 --> 36:06.947
There's just one problem.

36:06.947 --> 36:07.981
Where's Moe?

36:07.981 --> 36:09.114
We have a big
night tonight,

36:09.114 --> 36:10.447
and he's not here tonight.

36:10.447 --> 36:12.114
Moe is nowhere to be found.

36:12.114 --> 36:13.581
Couldn't you call him?

36:13.581 --> 36:15.347
Moe needs to be around.

36:15.347 --> 36:17.181
But he thinks that since

36:17.181 --> 36:18.147
he's the owner
of the restaurant,

36:18.147 --> 36:19.681
he can do whatever.

36:21.181 --> 36:21.466
Yes?

36:21.466 --> 36:22.081
Yes?

36:22.081 --> 36:23.181
I don't know if you know,

36:23.181 --> 36:24.547
but your restaurant's
launching tonight.

36:24.547 --> 36:26.547
Are you upstairs,
in bed?

36:28.347 --> 36:29.847
I'm coming down.
Wait for me.

36:33.081 --> 36:34.381
With Moe back
at the restaurant...

36:34.381 --> 36:35.781
Oh,.

36:35.781 --> 36:37.214
Let's go in the kitchen
and have a quick meeting.

36:37.214 --> 36:38.814
Chef Ramsay is determined

36:38.814 --> 36:41.214
to ensure that the relaunch
will be a success.

36:41.214 --> 36:43.714
So he has called upon
three of his chefs

36:43.714 --> 36:45.647
to support
the kitchen staff.

36:45.647 --> 36:48.947
My team will be getting
your team up to speed.

36:48.947 --> 36:51.147
Tonight, we've got
big time, top chefs

36:51.147 --> 36:51.466
in our kitchen,
training our staff

36:51.466 --> 36:53.581
in our kitchen,
training our staff

36:53.581 --> 36:55.347
how the new menu's
gonna be cooked.

36:55.347 --> 36:56.381
Tonight is about
getting it right

36:56.381 --> 36:58.547
and getting it set up
for the future.

36:58.547 --> 37:00.214
Yes, chef.
Let's go, guys.

37:01.181 --> 37:02.547
Come on in.

37:02.547 --> 37:03.847
For tonight's dinner service,

37:03.847 --> 37:05.781
the brothers are in
their regular positions,

37:05.781 --> 37:07.447
with Rami
supervising the kitchen...

37:07.447 --> 37:09.247
Everything's fresh?
Yes, sir.

37:09.247 --> 37:11.181
And Moe running
the front of the house.

37:11.181 --> 37:12.214
Welcome. Come on in.

37:12.214 --> 37:13.747
This looks fantastic.

37:13.747 --> 37:15.381
How you doing?
Good to see you.

37:15.381 --> 37:17.314
For you, sir?

37:17.314 --> 37:18.381
I'm just gonna get
the combo platter

37:18.381 --> 37:20.181
with the oysters,
fried well.

37:20.181 --> 37:21.247
I'd like the jambalaya.

37:21.247 --> 37:21.466
Look, I need a side
of sweet mash

37:21.466 --> 37:22.914
Look, I need a side
of sweet mash

37:22.914 --> 37:24.347
and a side of greens--
can you do that for me?

37:24.347 --> 37:25.614
Yeah.

37:25.614 --> 37:26.714
How long on that
French po' boy?

37:26.714 --> 37:28.047
One minute.

37:28.047 --> 37:29.014
53, okay?

37:32.114 --> 37:33.914
Thank you.

37:33.914 --> 37:35.381
This is going real,
real, real, real, real,

37:35.381 --> 37:37.114
real, real, real,
real good.

37:37.114 --> 37:38.514
Pardon me.

37:38.514 --> 37:40.081
Look at the difference
in the food coming out.

37:40.081 --> 37:41.347
Great, this is the difference.
It's great.

37:41.347 --> 37:43.581
Comes at a price,
but it's worth the effort.

37:43.581 --> 37:45.047
Watch the fire.
Watch the fire.

37:45.047 --> 37:47.181
I don't want anybody burning
their hands.

37:47.181 --> 37:49.081
What's smoldering
in the kitchen?

37:49.081 --> 37:51.081
Moe's supposed to be working
around the dining room,

37:51.081 --> 37:51.466
Greeting people,

37:51.466 --> 37:52.447
Greeting people,

37:52.447 --> 37:53.981
but he doesn't do
what he's supposed to do

37:53.981 --> 37:55.047
half of the time.

37:55.047 --> 37:56.214
Most of the time,
matter of fact.

37:56.214 --> 37:57.714
Why does he always
pick on me, man?

37:57.714 --> 37:58.914
I-I don't know.

37:58.914 --> 38:00.647
We're relaunching
the restaurant now,

38:00.647 --> 38:01.814
and customers are coming in.

38:01.814 --> 38:03.314
Get out there and welcome
your customers

38:03.314 --> 38:04.514
to the new restaurant.

38:04.514 --> 38:06.714
You won't tell me that
from the beginning.

38:06.714 --> 38:08.747
Talk to me in English,
and I'll do it.

38:08.747 --> 38:10.247
He keeps speaking
that foreign language,

38:10.247 --> 38:11.781
I can't get
that foreign.

38:12.914 --> 38:15.114
How you doing?
Come on in.

38:15.114 --> 38:16.881
It's an hour
into dinner service...

38:16.881 --> 38:18.681
Thank you.
My pleasure.
You all enjoy yourselves.

38:18.681 --> 38:20.214
This is so good.

38:20.214 --> 38:21.466
And customers are enjoying

38:21.466 --> 38:21.681
And customers are enjoying

38:21.681 --> 38:23.081
the new menu at Oceana.

38:23.081 --> 38:25.181
How we lookin'?
How we lookin'?

38:25.181 --> 38:26.481
How we lookin'?
How we lookin'?

38:26.481 --> 38:27.581
How we lookin'?

38:27.581 --> 38:28.947
But back in the kitchen,

38:28.947 --> 38:31.181
Moe seems more concerned
about the speed of the food

38:31.181 --> 38:32.281
than anything else.

38:32.281 --> 38:34.414
Table 51.
How long has it been in for?

38:34.414 --> 38:35.614
10 minutes.

38:35.614 --> 38:36.947
What are they doing
back there?

38:36.947 --> 38:38.881
What's taking so long?

38:38.881 --> 38:41.547
Food takes time to cook.
Do you understand?

38:41.547 --> 38:42.747
I understand.
Yeah?

38:42.747 --> 38:44.581
For a man who loves duck
coming out of a bag,

38:44.581 --> 38:46.281
we can't just
throw it out of a bag.

38:46.281 --> 38:47.214
It's cooked to order, yeah?

38:49.581 --> 38:51.147
Can you leave me
the  alone?

38:51.147 --> 38:51.466
This is my restaurant.

38:51.466 --> 38:52.581
This is my restaurant.

38:52.581 --> 38:53.714
I do what the  I want.

38:53.714 --> 38:55.747
Like, right now,
I'm gonna take a break.

38:57.014 --> 38:58.081
Where's Moe?

39:01.681 --> 39:03.214
You going?

39:08.647 --> 39:09.881
You wouldn't know
what stress is

39:09.881 --> 39:10.947
if it was hitting you
in the face.

39:16.881 --> 39:18.347
So Moe's gone.

39:18.347 --> 39:20.214
In the middle of service,
he just...disappears.

39:20.214 --> 39:21.214
Vanished, huh?

39:21.214 --> 39:21.466
Just gone.

39:21.466 --> 39:22.781
Just gone.

39:22.781 --> 39:24.147
I am very frustrated
right now.

39:24.147 --> 39:26.547
Moe cannot be walking out
on a night like this.

39:26.547 --> 39:28.014
Like Chef Ramsay say,

39:28.014 --> 39:29.581
"me."

39:38.546 --> 39:43.446
it may be relaunch night
at Oceana...

39:43.446 --> 39:47.046
But Moe has decided
that he needs a break.

39:47.046 --> 39:49.912
In the middle of service,
he just vanished, huh?

39:49.912 --> 39:51.246
Just gone.

39:51.246 --> 39:52.746
It is very frustrating
when Moe walk out.

39:52.746 --> 39:54.312
He used to have
a slow restaurant.

39:54.312 --> 39:55.979
He was able to walk out.

39:55.979 --> 39:57.779
However, tonight,
it was different.

39:57.779 --> 40:00.746
We were busy.
He should have never left.

40:01.946 --> 40:04.746
Moe!

40:04.746 --> 40:05.473
You have
a responsibility.

40:05.473 --> 40:07.179
You have
a responsibility.

40:07.179 --> 40:08.479
Where are you going?

40:08.479 --> 40:10.212
I'm taking
a little break.

40:10.212 --> 40:12.546
We're still sending entrees.

40:12.546 --> 40:14.679
You've been stressing me out
since day one.

40:14.679 --> 40:17.879
I gotta put
my head together.

40:17.879 --> 40:21.446
Quit following me
everywhere I go.

40:21.446 --> 40:24.579
Wow, what
a  fruitcake.

40:30.246 --> 40:31.646
Hey, guys.
Yes, Chef?

40:31.646 --> 40:32.746
It's not gonna be easy.

40:32.746 --> 40:34.279
Step up to the plate
tonight, yes?

40:34.279 --> 40:35.473
Uh, yeah.
Finish strong, yeah?

40:35.473 --> 40:35.712
Uh, yeah.
Finish strong, yeah?

40:35.712 --> 40:36.712
Start to work together.

40:36.712 --> 40:37.679
How long on the pasta?

40:37.679 --> 40:39.012
I need rice on one!

40:39.012 --> 40:40.679
31, sir.

40:40.679 --> 40:42.146
That's it.
Keep it going,
guys. Let's go.

40:42.146 --> 40:43.979
While Moe is on his break,

40:43.979 --> 40:45.979
the kitchen staff
doesn't skip a beat

40:45.979 --> 40:48.979
as they work hard to
push out the final entree.

40:48.979 --> 40:50.412
Three tickets to go, guys.
Come on.

40:50.412 --> 40:52.246
Finish strong.

40:52.246 --> 40:54.746
This tastes good.
It actually has good flavor.

40:54.746 --> 40:57.079
And other than Moe's
unusual absence...

40:57.079 --> 40:58.079
He's not back yet?
No.

40:58.079 --> 40:59.512
Wow.

40:59.512 --> 41:01.546
Relaunch night
is a success.

41:01.546 --> 41:02.879
Well done.

41:02.879 --> 41:04.612
Chef Ramsay's menu
is amazing.

41:04.612 --> 41:05.473
It was fresh. Everything was
coming out on time.

41:05.473 --> 41:07.212
It was fresh. Everything was
coming out on time.

41:07.212 --> 41:08.479
Everything was awesome.

41:08.479 --> 41:09.779
Good job.

41:12.379 --> 41:13.646
Enjoy your break?

41:13.646 --> 41:16.412
I'm way more relaxed now.
I'm way more happy.

41:16.412 --> 41:18.079
You look
a little stressed.

41:18.079 --> 41:19.646
I don't relax,
I don't let my guard down

41:19.646 --> 41:21.312
till that
last customer's left.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.446
If I start joking around
and jumping outside,

41:23.446 --> 41:26.779
the standards just drop
instantly.

41:26.779 --> 41:28.612
I don't know what Chef Ramsay's
deal is.

41:28.612 --> 41:29.812
He always picks on me.

41:29.812 --> 41:31.512
I went outside
to take a little break.

41:31.512 --> 41:32.446
What's the big deal?

41:32.446 --> 41:33.946
I'm not a little baby.

41:37.179 --> 41:39.745
Okay.
How are you feeling?

41:39.745 --> 41:41.745
Pleased you are, yes?
Yes.

41:41.745 --> 41:43.612
You worked very hard.
Thank you.

41:43.612 --> 41:44.679
Yeah.
How are you feeling?

41:44.679 --> 41:48.079
I have mixed feelings.
Uh-huh.

41:48.079 --> 41:50.979
And your mixed feelings
are what?

41:50.979 --> 41:53.145
How about we go get
a drink on Bourbon Street

41:53.145 --> 41:55.012
and talk about it?

41:56.412 --> 41:59.179
Are you kidding me?
No.

41:59.179 --> 42:02.312
Both, I am
seriously concerned.

42:02.312 --> 42:04.412
Even before our
dinner service was over,

42:04.412 --> 42:05.473
you were
nowhere to be seen.

42:05.473 --> 42:05.779
you were
nowhere to be seen.

42:05.779 --> 42:08.379
I mean, I had to
take a break.

42:08.379 --> 42:09.579
Don't you take breaks?

42:09.579 --> 42:10.579
You loosen up
a little bit,

42:10.579 --> 42:13.145
you'll be
more open-minded.

42:16.645 --> 42:19.512
Moe, don't be
scared of change.

42:19.512 --> 42:23.612
Embrace it and keep
your standards high.

42:23.612 --> 42:27.145
Chef Ramsay gave us
a new menu,

42:27.145 --> 42:29.245
a new atmosphere,
a new everything.

42:29.245 --> 42:31.179
But I'm very concerned
that Moe

42:31.179 --> 42:34.779
want to go back
to old ways.

42:34.779 --> 42:35.473
Okay, I'm done.

42:35.473 --> 42:37.045
Okay, I'm done.

42:37.045 --> 42:38.145
You're leaving already?

42:38.145 --> 42:40.545
Yes.
Wow.

42:40.545 --> 42:42.545
Look after
your little brother.

42:42.545 --> 42:44.279
Good night.
Good night, Chef.

42:44.279 --> 42:45.545
He's crazy.

42:45.545 --> 42:48.145
You want to go have
a little drink?
No.

42:48.145 --> 42:49.379
You don't want to
have a drink?

42:49.379 --> 42:50.512
I have to clean up.

42:52.179 --> 42:53.912
Moe thinks that running
a restaurant on Bourbon Street

42:53.912 --> 42:55.312
is all about having
a good time,

42:55.312 --> 42:56.745
when it should be
about dedication

42:56.745 --> 42:58.612
and striving for success.

42:58.612 --> 43:01.312
That's why I'm not sure
that Oceana

43:01.312 --> 43:04.212
will be here next year
when I come back.

43:04.212 --> 43:05.473
Wow.

43:05.473 --> 43:05.712
Wow.

43:05.712 --> 43:07.945
"I've got all the recipes
inside my head."

43:07.945 --> 43:09.945
Unbelievable.
