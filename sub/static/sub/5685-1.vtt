02:33.486 --> 02:35.404
Is it bad tonight?

02:35.405 --> 02:39.408
Bad?
That's one way to describe it.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.995
"Insane" seems
a little more appropriate.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.581
He's breathing down my neck.

02:45.790 --> 02:49.585
It's my opinion
we should get the hell out of here.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.046
- Now!
- Noted.

02:53.590 --> 02:57.259
Clean this place up
and locate our guests.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.768
I just need to take the edge off.

03:06.769 --> 03:11.064
You know the routine.
I need you clearheaded.

03:11.065 --> 03:13.776
First things first.

03:16.070 --> 03:19.115
Now, where is he?

03:21.451 --> 03:24.620
Show me where he's hiding.

03:39.636 --> 03:43.639
You said he killed nine!
There's 40 victims here!

03:43.640 --> 03:46.808
Nine when he was alive.
He's added a few.

03:46.809 --> 03:50.062
Now where is he, Dennis?

03:59.656 --> 04:03.701
All teams go to alpha.
Bring in the cube!

04:05.620 --> 04:09.706
Why is he named The Breaker?
Is he a truck driver?

04:09.707 --> 04:14.336
Simple folklore.
The local colour exorcising its demons.

04:14.504 --> 04:19.175
Or maybe it's because
he broke his victims into pieces.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.512
I hate being rushed.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.180
This one's different.

04:25.181 --> 04:28.225
- You'll get a bonus.
- With what money?

04:28.226 --> 04:32.354
After tonight, you'll be surprised.
Get to work.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.696
Careful, Dennis.

04:40.863 --> 04:44.575
Don't get too curious.

04:45.201 --> 04:49.038
No! Son of a bitch!

04:49.414 --> 04:53.250
How can you justify what
you're doing? It's slavery.

04:53.251 --> 04:57.129
You are persistent, Damon.
And you, Kalina?

04:57.130 --> 05:03.218
Still carrying around your quicksilver
flares and the little magic book?

05:03.219 --> 05:07.055
You're not capturing animals.
They're human beings!

05:07.056 --> 05:08.724
Dead human beings.

05:08.725 --> 05:13.938
You should join Greenpeace.
Throw blood on old women's furs.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.399
Who are you to play God?

05:18.401 --> 05:21.903
- Playing's for children.
- You won't succeed.

05:21.904 --> 05:26.033
Not without the right spells
and the 13th ghost.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.576
13th ghost?

05:27.577 --> 05:32.080
Get them out of my sight!
We've wasted too much time.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.249
Why did he say 13th?

05:34.250 --> 05:36.585
Move the cube into position.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.920
What did he mean, 13 ghosts?

05:38.921 --> 05:42.883
You contracted me for 12 ghosts.
The Breaker's 12!

05:42.884 --> 05:44.801
I'm done after tonight.

05:44.802 --> 05:49.431
Yes, 12 and then one more.
I thought you were psychic.

05:49.432 --> 05:53.769
- That's not how it works.
- There's no time to argue.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.104
Release the bait.

05:56.105 --> 06:00.317
What bait?
We never needed bait before!

06:11.704 --> 06:16.083
A truck full of blood?
You've gotta be shitting me.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.671
Oh, boy.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.260
Now...

06:27.261 --> 06:29.430
...power up the cube.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.814
Start transmitting.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.554
Come.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.994
Come.

07:13.029 --> 07:14.850
Come!

07:20.773 --> 07:23.525
Oh, God! Help me!

07:23.526 --> 07:25.694
Help me!

07:31.200 --> 07:33.661
Oh, shit!

08:00.605 --> 08:03.232
Where is it?
I can't see it!

08:38.058 --> 08:39.934
Put him down!

08:53.658 --> 08:57.619
Hey, Cyrus. I hope you're happy.
You got your 12.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.872
Help me! He's dying!

09:00.873 --> 09:04.459
Hang on, Damon. Somebody help!
Damn you, Cyrus!

09:04.460 --> 09:07.129
Somebody help me, please!

09:08.464 --> 09:11.633
Help me. Do something!

09:19.308 --> 09:21.309
Oh, Cyrus.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.479
Oh, God.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.399
Oh, Cyrus.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.614
- Swing me.
- Come on, Bobby.

09:34.615 --> 09:37.200
Come on, Kathy. Faster!

09:37.201 --> 09:40.662
- Let me get your arms.
- Come on. Try to drag me.

09:40.663 --> 09:44.207
You're the best little brother.
I love you.

09:44.208 --> 09:49.505
- Come on.
- I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you!

09:50.923 --> 09:53.967
Look at them.
She's got him on the run now...

09:53.968 --> 09:58.013
...but soon he'll be throwing her
over his shoulder.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.348
They're perfect.

10:00.349 --> 10:03.185
No, watch. Watch them.

10:04.228 --> 10:07.731
They really love this place.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.822
I love you, you know?

10:15.823 --> 10:18.450
<i>Surprise!</i>

10:19.076 --> 10:21.328
<i>My heart! My heart!</i>

10:21.329 --> 10:24.706
<i>- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Happy birthday!</i>

10:24.707 --> 10:28.084
<i>- Happy birthday, Arthur.
- Here's my present.</i>

10:28.085 --> 10:32.714
<i>- We love you. Make a wish.
- Blow out the candles.</i>

10:32.715 --> 10:34.674
<i>What'd you wish for?</i>

10:34.675 --> 10:38.887
<i>- I love you.
- I love you too.</i>

10:42.725 --> 10:45.268
<i>What's that?
The smoke alarm?</i>

10:45.269 --> 10:48.104
<i>It's the fire alarm.
I'll get the kids.</i>

10:48.105 --> 10:49.856
<i>Dad! Help, Mom!</i>

10:49.857 --> 10:52.776
<i>- Get the kids. Get the kids!
- Mom! Dad!</i>

10:52.777 --> 10:56.613
<i>- Mom! Dad! Help me!
- Dad, come on!</i>

10:56.614 --> 11:00.033
<i>- Where's your mom?
- I don't know!</i>

11:00.034 --> 11:02.911
<i>Bobby, we have to get out.
Oh, my God!</i>

11:02.912 --> 11:04.746
<i>Jean! Jean!</i>

11:04.747 --> 11:08.625
<i>Mom's still in the house.
We can't leave her here.</i>

11:08.626 --> 11:11.920
<i>Bobby, go outside.
Go wait outside, now.</i>

11:11.921 --> 11:15.215
<i>You can't go back in there, sir.</i>

11:21.597 --> 11:24.766
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
She didn't make it.</i>

11:24.767 --> 11:28.312
<i>I should have gone back in.</i>

11:31.816 --> 11:37.612
<i>We're here to honour the memory
and life's work of Jean Kriticos...</i>

11:37.613 --> 11:43.619
<i>...a devoted mother and loving wife,
who was too quickly taken from life.</i>

11:43.953 --> 11:49.040
<i>Jean, you will be forever missed,
but never forgotten.</i>

11:49.041 --> 11:52.460
<i>- I miss you, Mom.
- I miss you, Mom.</i>

11:52.461 --> 11:56.465
<i>Why did you have to leave us?</i>

11:56.841 --> 12:00.093
<i>- I can't do this without you.
- Don't go.</i>

12:00.094 --> 12:03.430
<i>Mom, I love you so much.</i>

12:03.431 --> 12:06.683
<i>Please watch over us.</i>

12:07.059 --> 12:10.646
<i>I'll love you always.</i>

12:19.488 --> 12:21.365
Dad, it's al...

12:22.074 --> 12:26.828
It's almost 8:30. Shake a leg
or you'll miss your first class.

12:26.829 --> 12:30.331
<i>Today on Death in America:
Cancer rates are down...</i>

12:30.332 --> 12:32.501
...but suicide is sky-high.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.961
We have a treat today.

12:34.962 --> 12:38.339
A body was found, "decolopolated".

12:38.340 --> 12:41.677
Hey, hey. "Decapitated".

12:41.886 --> 12:44.012
Find a healthier hobby.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.514
Leave me alone. I'm recording!

12:46.515 --> 12:52.103
Good morning, everybody.
Something smells interesting.

12:52.104 --> 12:55.732
They found a headless guy
behind Dunkin' Donuts.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.527
I love Dunkin' Donuts.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.029
- Shit!
- Kathy.

13:01.030 --> 13:05.200
Why not let Maggie make breakfast?
That's why we hired her.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.827
Have you tasted her cooking?

13:07.828 --> 13:11.122
- Just that once.
- Hey, I heard that!

13:11.123 --> 13:15.168
- I cook better than you.
- We have to try to get along.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.878
Okay.

13:16.879 --> 13:21.049
Tell Kathy that keeping
a record of death is healthy.

13:21.050 --> 13:24.177
Keeping a record of deaths
is healthy.

13:24.178 --> 13:29.891
- She's being a little slut about it.
- Don't call your sister a slut.

13:29.892 --> 13:33.395
- Thank you.
- I prefer the term "bitch".

13:34.522 --> 13:36.231
Sluts have loose sex...

13:36.232 --> 13:40.610
Did you do your homework?
Because Mr. Peterson told me...

13:41.237 --> 13:42.904
Damn it, Bobby!

13:42.905 --> 13:45.782
I've tripped on that three times!

13:45.783 --> 13:48.576
- Sorry.
- We need a bigger place.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.287
We don't have a big place anymore.

13:51.288 --> 13:54.207
This is the best I can do for now.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.710
So let's try and keep our shit
off the floor.

13:57.711 --> 14:03.716
Now put away the damn tape recorder
and get ready for school.

14:03.717 --> 14:07.095
I'm sorry, Dad.

14:08.973 --> 14:12.100
- Must be the lawyer. I forgot.
- What lawyer?

14:12.101 --> 14:16.438
- Isn't our credit cleaned up?
- It's not about that.

14:17.439 --> 14:20.608
They won't make us move again,
will they?

14:20.609 --> 14:24.613
It's all right.
Whatever it is, we'll deal with it.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.907
- Mr. Kriticos?
- Yes. You're?

14:27.908 --> 14:31.286
- Ben Moss. How do you do?
- Please come in.

14:31.287 --> 14:35.832
- Is now a good time, or?
- Good a time as any.

14:35.833 --> 14:40.212
Please, just give me one minute,
will you?

14:41.797 --> 14:44.465
Okay. Sorry. I'm ready.

14:44.466 --> 14:48.219
I represent your uncle
Cyrus Kriticos' estate.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.806
- We have an Uncle Cyrus?
- Had.

14:51.807 --> 14:56.519
I met him a couple of times as a kid.
He wasn't popular.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.980
Squandered the family fortune.

14:58.981 --> 15:03.276
- We have a family fortune?
- No. Cyrus squandered it.

15:03.277 --> 15:07.322
- Bobby, you have a late uncle.
- What is he late for?

15:07.323 --> 15:10.366
- His next birthday.
- You mean he's dead?

15:10.367 --> 15:12.952
- That got his attention.
- Pipe down.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.663
Cyrus recorded this six weeks ago...

15:15.664 --> 15:19.501
...to be played for you
in the event of his death.

15:27.134 --> 15:31.804
<i>Arthur, it's good to talk to you.</i>

15:31.805 --> 15:36.017
<i>Sadly, if you're watching this,
it means I am dead.</i>

15:36.060 --> 15:41.022
<i>Happily, that makes you
and your family my sole beneficiaries.</i>

15:41.023 --> 15:46.194
<i>I've instructed my lawyer, Mr. Moss,
to deliver the essential elements...</i>

15:46.195 --> 15:51.158
<i>...in my last will and testament.
Give it to them, Ben.</i>

15:56.080 --> 15:59.332
- A key?
- A key to what?

15:59.333 --> 16:03.169
<i>- A key to your new house.
- What?</i>

16:03.170 --> 16:08.216
<i>This house is the fruit
of my life's work.</i>

16:08.550 --> 16:11.302
Everyone gets their own bathroom!

16:11.303 --> 16:15.014
<i>- Is this for real?
- It is a one-of-a-kind home.</i>

16:15.015 --> 16:17.893
<i>It's my home, actually.</i>

16:19.019 --> 16:20.895
<i>My home.</i>

16:20.896 --> 16:24.691
<i>I have no complaints.
I've led an interesting life.</i>

16:24.692 --> 16:28.236
<i>I have seen some amazing things.</i>

16:30.447 --> 16:35.243
<i>My only regret is that I never
got to know my nephew, Arthur...</i>

16:35.244 --> 16:39.080
<i>...nor appreciate the love
of a family, like you have.</i>

16:39.081 --> 16:44.252
<i>This house is my attempt
to make up for that.</i>

16:44.253 --> 16:46.546
<i>Enjoy.</i>

16:48.924 --> 16:51.718
<i>Perhaps we'll meet again...</i>

16:52.136 --> 16:54.930
<i>...in another life.</i>

16:57.641 --> 16:59.934
- Wow!
- When can we see it?

16:59.935 --> 17:03.604
Whenever you like.
I'm heading there today.

17:03.605 --> 17:06.107
If you want, your wife and kids...

17:06.108 --> 17:11.112
- Time out. I am not the missus here.
- My wife...

17:11.113 --> 17:14.991
- My wife is...
- Our mom burned to death in a fire.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.993
- Bobby!
- What? It's true.

17:17.994 --> 17:20.163
That's enough, Robert.

17:20.164 --> 17:24.625
Mr. Moss, just exactly where
is this place?

17:24.626 --> 17:30.006
Just a couple hours drive from here,
a town called Willow Grove.

17:30.007 --> 17:34.135
It's in a gorgeous area.
Your uncle liked his privacy.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.637
There isn't a neighbour for miles.

17:36.638 --> 17:41.184
- Come on, hurry up.
- S-U-F...

17:41.185 --> 17:46.981
- Suffocate! I got it. I win.
- So what? You think you're so slick.

17:46.982 --> 17:50.652
Come on, you guys.
We're almost there.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.613
- Excited?
- Yeah.

17:53.614 --> 17:57.826
- Mom would have freaked over this.
- Yeah.

17:57.993 --> 18:02.121
Looks like things are starting
to get better, right?

18:02.122 --> 18:04.291
Yeah.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.501
That's strange.

19:31.378 --> 19:35.256
Dad, it's beautiful!

19:35.424 --> 19:39.636
My God!
I've never seen anything like it.

19:41.763 --> 19:46.434
Cool! So "futuroic".

19:53.066 --> 19:56.402
About time someone showed up.
This your place?

19:56.403 --> 19:59.739
- Who are you?
- I'm the power guy.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.617
Don't touch.

20:02.618 --> 20:06.913
Your house is knocking out the power
of the whole area.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.248
I need to check the breakers.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.918
Could you come back tomorrow?

20:11.919 --> 20:13.753
Tomorrow? Let me see.

20:13.754 --> 20:17.798
There's about 5570 houses
right now without power.

20:17.799 --> 20:23.096
- My bosses kind of frown on that.
- That's not really our problem, is it?

20:24.973 --> 20:30.311
I've been at this job for three weeks.
Can't you give me a break here?

20:30.312 --> 20:34.065
Sure. No problem.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.817
Thank you.

20:36.818 --> 20:40.488
- Mr?
- Kriticos. Arthur Kriticos.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.575
Quite a place you've got.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.453
Yeah. We're moving in.

20:47.454 --> 20:50.290
Well, one step at a time.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.976
- That's odd.
- Dad, you broke it!

21:10.018 --> 21:11.811
Give it a rest.

21:16.858 --> 21:18.860
Hello.

21:18.986 --> 21:22.863
Wow! You can see right through it.

21:22.864 --> 21:27.034
- You guys couldn't afford walls?
- How weird.

21:27.035 --> 21:30.538
Guess Cyrus wasn't too keen
on privacy.

21:30.539 --> 21:34.209
I sure hope the bathroom's
in the basement.

22:15.042 --> 22:18.419
It's like a fun house.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.422
It's Latin.

22:31.266 --> 22:34.227
Everything's so beautiful.

22:35.395 --> 22:40.066
Just so we're all clear,
Miss Maggie does not do windows.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.318
Wow!

22:47.824 --> 22:51.953
What an incredible wealth
of knowledge!

22:53.580 --> 22:56.248
- A samurai sword!
- Bobby.

22:56.249 --> 22:59.127
In your dreams, pal.

23:01.296 --> 23:07.302
- This stuff must be worth a fortune.
- Yeah, that occurred to me too.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.103
Oh, Cyrus.

23:17.104 --> 23:21.983
You crazy son of a bitch,
what did you do?

23:37.165 --> 23:42.128
Goodness! It's like a cathedral.

23:42.170 --> 23:46.632
All right, first rule:
No throwing stones.

23:46.633 --> 23:49.302
It's marvellous, isn't it?

23:50.053 --> 23:53.181
A living work of art.

23:56.768 --> 24:02.148
As soon as you show me
the basement, I'll be out of here.

24:02.816 --> 24:07.362
I believe it's down the hall.
It's two doors on the right.

24:09.698 --> 24:12.325
Excuse me.

24:15.996 --> 24:19.165
The construction is amazing!

24:21.376 --> 24:24.379
I'm getting dizzy.

24:28.508 --> 24:33.596
Don't touch anything. Okay?

24:33.722 --> 24:37.099
At least until
we get some property insurance.

24:37.100 --> 24:42.438
Arthur, we have papers to sign.
Then I'll give you all a tour.

24:42.439 --> 24:47.735
Great. You guys don't move
from this spot. We'll be right back.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.613
Dad, you're being overprotective.

24:50.614 --> 24:54.742
Yeah, of all this stuff.
I know you guys too well.

24:54.743 --> 25:00.623
Stay right here.
I mean it.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.273
What the...?

25:42.457 --> 25:46.127
Where'd you hide your money,
old man?

25:59.266 --> 26:01.684
Oh, shit.

26:02.018 --> 26:04.771
What the hell was that?

26:10.902 --> 26:14.822
Oh, no. Oh, Cyrus.

26:17.701 --> 26:22.121
Now I know I'm dreaming.

26:22.956 --> 26:26.333
- Was Cyrus a hunter?
- You could say that.

26:26.334 --> 26:32.006
Your uncle was quite a collector
of many things.

26:38.513 --> 26:41.807
I've marked where
you're supposed to sign.

26:41.808 --> 26:44.150
Okay, look.

26:44.185 --> 26:48.939
I didn't want to bring this up
in front of the kids, but...

26:48.940 --> 26:52.735
Well, this place is beyond amazing.

26:58.158 --> 27:03.245
I'm just a math teacher.
The taxes alone must be...

27:03.246 --> 27:07.583
I have nothing set aside.

27:07.584 --> 27:12.004
To be honest,
a fire took away everything.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.965
Arthur, you don't need to worry.

27:14.966 --> 27:18.844
Cyrus was a genius
when it came to finances.

27:18.845 --> 27:22.849
None of you ever have
to worry about money again.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.771
You son of a bitch.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.247
Look here! Look, you all.

28:28.248 --> 28:31.834
Look, look, look, look!

28:38.341 --> 28:40.676
Sign.

28:41.302 --> 28:43.763
Arthur? Arthur?

28:44.931 --> 28:48.976
Arthur, we've gotta...
Arthur, we have to talk.

28:48.977 --> 28:54.064
- What is the deal with the breakers?
- Nothing. I'm not the power guy.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.650
- I'm Dennis Rafkin.
- You're Rafkin?

28:56.651 --> 28:59.319
- Who's that?
- My office warned me...

28:59.320 --> 29:03.115
I know it's gonna sound whacked,
but stay with me.

29:03.116 --> 29:07.494
I hunted displaced spiritual energies
with your uncle.

29:07.495 --> 29:12.332
- I'm sorry?
- PK agents. Revenants.

29:12.333 --> 29:16.629
Wraiths. Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?

29:17.297 --> 29:21.258
That's okay.
I'll do this the easy way: Ghosts.

29:21.259 --> 29:27.390
Arthur, I used to hunt ghosts
with your Uncle Cyrus.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.142
- Goats?
- Ghosts!

29:30.143 --> 29:32.227
Ghosts, goddamn it! Listen!

29:32.228 --> 29:33.896
I'll race you.

29:33.897 --> 29:37.399
No, Bobby, this isn't the place for...

29:37.400 --> 29:42.529
Come on, slowpoke. Is that your best?
My grandma scoots better than that.

29:42.530 --> 29:47.618
Ghosts, as in disgruntled spirits
trapped on Earth. Ghosts.

29:47.619 --> 29:52.498
As in Halloween. As in Demi Moore
and "Unchained Melody". Ghosts.

29:52.499 --> 29:56.251
Ghosts, right. Okay, I get it.
I'm scared.

29:56.252 --> 29:59.379
Don't laugh at me. Don't laugh.

29:59.380 --> 30:04.927
I'll explain everything as soon as you
get you and your children outside.

30:04.928 --> 30:09.389
- What's taking you so long?
- Out of my way. Come on, Maggie!

30:09.390 --> 30:14.311
- You cheated. I didn't say "start".
- Gotta be on your toes.

30:14.312 --> 30:18.690
This has to be my room!
There are toys everywhere.

30:18.691 --> 30:22.778
- I wonder what my room's like.
- I'm in the coolest room.

30:27.283 --> 30:31.037
I'll be in here.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.757
<i>Wow.</i>

30:43.758 --> 30:48.220
This place is awesome!

30:48.221 --> 30:52.391
Cyrus has containment cubes
all over the basement.

30:52.392 --> 30:56.687
I don't know why they're here
and I don't want to find out.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.439
- So if I were you...
- Well, he isn't you.

30:59.440 --> 31:05.112
This guy has been harassing my office
since your uncle died.

31:05.113 --> 31:09.241
Some rich guy passes away
and all the nuts come out!

31:09.242 --> 31:11.785
Next he'll say Cyrus
owed him money.

31:11.786 --> 31:15.455
He did. A shitload of money!

31:15.456 --> 31:19.335
These are some
funky-looking specs.

31:20.211 --> 31:23.297
- Do I look cool, or what?
- Let me see.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.841
Wait. Cater to my ego first.

31:25.842 --> 31:29.720
- Maggie is the best babysitter...
- Come on!

31:29.721 --> 31:35.810
I'm leaving the big glass house!
Grab your children. Do the same.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.313
Are you all right?

31:48.907 --> 31:51.992
<i>Jean! Jean! Jean!</i>

31:54.162 --> 31:58.999
- We'll get you some help. Okay?
- Don't touch me.

32:07.759 --> 32:11.137
Oh, my God!

32:18.561 --> 32:20.688
We've struck gold.

32:21.356 --> 32:24.567
- Easy.
- Don't.

32:32.867 --> 32:35.369
How's your head?

32:35.578 --> 32:37.705
Not good.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.541
Where's the suit?

32:52.303 --> 32:55.598
"Power guy". Idiot.

32:56.432 --> 33:00.895
- Cool!
- There better be a pair in my room.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.731
Bobby, where are you going?

33:06.901 --> 33:09.904
What are you staring at?

33:10.738 --> 33:15.784
Hey, kiddo.
He thinks I'm gonna duck.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.787
Nice tits.

33:19.414 --> 33:24.919
Jeez. What's the matter, honey?
Bad representation?

33:51.654 --> 33:54.323
Not bad for an hourly wage.

34:04.459 --> 34:09.463
- It's time to leave.
- I'll take your word for it.

34:10.505 --> 34:12.925
Kathy?

34:19.139 --> 34:21.641
Come on. This way.

34:24.145 --> 34:28.356
Shit! What the hell? Kathy!

34:28.357 --> 34:29.940
Maggie!

34:29.942 --> 34:32.235
Bobby!

35:00.348 --> 35:04.017
I was just kidding before.

35:04.018 --> 35:06.854
A little lawyer humour.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.515
Kathy?

35:43.516 --> 35:45.183
Bobby!

35:45.184 --> 35:47.686
Kathy?

35:48.479 --> 35:51.774
- I don't believe it.
- Believe what?

35:53.484 --> 35:57.988
- I told them to stay here.
- They're kids. What did you expect?

35:57.989 --> 36:01.575
Thanks, Dr. Phil.
You check downstairs, I'll go up.

36:01.576 --> 36:03.869
Bobby! It's time to go!

36:12.253 --> 36:14.629
Kathy? Where are you guys?

36:14.630 --> 36:16.799
Bobby!

36:18.551 --> 36:21.095
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

36:58.633 --> 37:01.427
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

37:36.462 --> 37:39.506
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

38:33.686 --> 38:37.230
What are you doing?
I told you to wait downstairs.

38:37.231 --> 38:40.734
Yes, but come on,
this bathroom is unbelievable.

38:40.735 --> 38:44.571
Yes, beautiful bathroom.
Now where's your brother?

38:44.572 --> 38:46.573
He's with Maggie.

38:46.574 --> 38:51.036
Was with Maggie. We were racing
and we saw all the glasses...

38:51.037 --> 38:55.624
You're supposed to watch him.
That's what I pay you for.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.970
<i>Bobby.</i>

39:10.931 --> 39:13.600
<i>Down here.</i>

39:13.601 --> 39:15.560
Maggie?

39:15.561 --> 39:20.107
<i>- Come on down and play.
- Is that you?</i>

39:21.442 --> 39:27.448
<i>- Maggie! Stop playing games.
- Bobby? I have something for you.</i>

39:27.698 --> 39:30.992
<i>We'll have lots of fun, Bobby.</i>

39:30.993 --> 39:33.787
<i>Don't come down, Bobby.</i>

39:33.788 --> 39:35.831
<i>Stay upstairs.</i>

39:37.625 --> 39:39.793
<i>Don't follow her.</i>

39:41.295 --> 39:44.673
<i>Down here, Bobby.</i>

39:45.966 --> 39:48.844
<i>Bobby, don't come down.</i>

39:49.512 --> 39:53.724
<i>Bobby. Around the corner.</i>

39:54.141 --> 39:57.727
<i>- Don't come down here!
- That's it, Bobby.</i>

39:57.728 --> 39:59.980
Guys, I'm gonna tell Dad!

40:01.023 --> 40:05.026
- Bobby!
- Bobby!

40:05.027 --> 40:07.862
I'll find Bobby. You both get out.

40:07.863 --> 40:09.656
- But, Dad...
- No buts!

40:09.657 --> 40:13.159
Wait in the car.
I'll be out once I find him.

40:13.160 --> 40:18.040
- Why are you freaking out?
- Just this once, don't argue.

40:19.166 --> 40:23.795
- What happened to the door?
- Son of a bitch!

40:23.796 --> 40:25.630
I can't believe this.

40:25.631 --> 40:28.759
I'll break it down. Step away!

40:35.266 --> 40:40.186
Quite dramatic, but you're wasting
your time. It's all sealed up.

40:40.187 --> 40:43.356
- Weren't you in an orange jumpsuit?
- Don't.

40:43.357 --> 40:45.275
Sealed up?

40:45.276 --> 40:50.280
What part of that code can't you
crack? The entire house is sealed up.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.074
- There must be a way.
- I've looked.

40:53.075 --> 40:56.077
We'll look again,
after we find my son.

40:56.078 --> 40:59.414
- That's okay. I'll wait here.
- Listen...

40:59.415 --> 41:04.544
...I don't know what is going on here,
or who the hell you are.

41:04.545 --> 41:08.214
And my son is missing.
So until I get answers...

41:08.215 --> 41:12.844
...I'm not letting you out
of my sight. Now get up!

41:13.095 --> 41:16.890
All right. Breathe.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.895
Did the lawyer split?

41:28.944 --> 41:31.738
<i>Bobby.</i>

41:51.342 --> 41:53.593
<i>Bobby.</i>

42:35.761 --> 42:39.473
Come on, guys! Stop hiding!

42:45.813 --> 42:48.189
- Bobby!
- Come on out, pal!

42:48.190 --> 42:51.901
- Stop screwing around!
- You're wasting your breath.

42:51.902 --> 42:57.282
This is ectobar glass. He won't hear
you. It's shatterproof and soundproof.

42:57.283 --> 42:58.700
What are these?

42:58.701 --> 43:02.829
That's harder to explain.
They're containment spells.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.956
Ghosts can't cross those.

43:04.957 --> 43:08.168
- Ghosts?
- Yes, ghosts.

43:08.544 --> 43:13.172
The supernatural realm has its
own laws. For ghosts, it's spells.

43:13.173 --> 43:17.427
Either written or spoken,
ghosts have to obey them.

43:37.031 --> 43:41.659
- The basement is filled with ghosts.
- In this basement?

43:41.660 --> 43:46.873
Yes, this basement. If it was
next door, I wouldn't give a shit!

43:50.377 --> 43:53.380
- I'll prove it.
- I gave those to Bobby.

43:57.843 --> 44:02.221
Spectral viewers:
You can see the ghosts with these.

44:02.222 --> 44:05.725
- I don't see anything.
- They're locked downstairs.

44:05.726 --> 44:07.518
Dad!

44:07.519 --> 44:10.897
There's more of those spells
on the floor.

44:11.690 --> 44:14.067
Let me see those.

44:20.991 --> 44:23.910
Bobby! Come on out, pal!

44:24.703 --> 44:29.248
Hidden barrier spells.
Why would he need more protection?

44:29.249 --> 44:33.419
That's enough. This is not helping.
Do me a favour.

44:33.420 --> 44:35.463
Stop the haunted-house nonsense.

44:35.464 --> 44:38.883
At least until we find Bobby
and get out of here.

44:38.884 --> 44:41.928
- Bobby, come on!
- Where could he be?

44:41.929 --> 44:43.930
Wait, no, no, no!

44:44.890 --> 44:48.726
Wait, no! What are you doing?
Did I just say...

44:48.727 --> 44:52.397
...there was a petting zoo
downstairs? No!

44:52.398 --> 44:54.941
There are ghosts downstairs.

44:54.942 --> 44:59.112
Right. But you also said...

44:59.113 --> 45:02.949
...that they're all locked up. Right?

45:03.242 --> 45:05.076
No! No way...!

45:06.745 --> 45:09.039
Listen...

45:09.081 --> 45:12.083
...I'll make a deal with you.

45:12.084 --> 45:15.795
I'll pay you whatever Cyrus
owed you.

45:15.796 --> 45:17.672
If you just...

45:17.673 --> 45:22.260
...help me find my son.

45:33.772 --> 45:37.150
Unbelievable. Get out of my way.

45:45.159 --> 45:47.285
<i>Bobby.</i>

46:02.968 --> 46:04.678
<i>Bobby...</i>

46:05.471 --> 46:10.183
<i>...get out of the basement.
You need to go upstairs.</i>

46:12.478 --> 46:15.271
<i>You need to put on those glasses.</i>

46:15.272 --> 46:17.983
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

46:20.152 --> 46:23.238
<i>That's it. That's a good boy.</i>

46:27.534 --> 46:29.869
<i>Bobby.</i>

46:32.164 --> 46:33.831
<i>Bobby.</i>

46:33.832 --> 46:36.710
<i>Go upstairs and find your father.</i>

46:37.377 --> 46:40.380
<i>- Mom?
- Go on.</i>

46:40.881 --> 46:43.258
<i>Go upstairs!</i>

46:46.053 --> 46:48.388
<i>Go find Kathy.</i>

46:48.972 --> 46:51.016
<i>Watch out.</i>

46:52.518 --> 46:54.102
<i>Watch out!</i>

46:54.269 --> 46:56.438
- Bobby, come on!
- Bobby!

46:59.733 --> 47:03.736
You don't have to scream, all right?
Just...

47:03.737 --> 47:05.947
...chill.

47:23.924 --> 47:28.053
- This way.
- Hold on. Listen to me.

47:28.387 --> 47:32.098
This will take forever.
This place is just too big.

47:32.099 --> 47:33.766
Okay.

47:33.767 --> 47:37.728
Kathy and I will go this way.
You two check down there.

47:37.729 --> 47:41.774
- No, we should stay together.
- It's okay.

47:41.775 --> 47:45.820
Go straight, turn around,
we'll meet back here in five.

47:45.821 --> 47:48.990
- Five. Back here.
- Five minutes.

47:48.991 --> 47:53.078
- And don't touch anything.
- I gotta go with him?

48:01.628 --> 48:04.130
Let's go back to the ghost thingy.

48:04.131 --> 48:08.593
There are ghosts in the basement.
You can look for yourself.

48:08.594 --> 48:10.595
I can't see any ghosts.

48:10.596 --> 48:15.725
What the hell? Give me those.
Let me see. Why are these open?

48:16.226 --> 48:19.813
I was down here before.
They weren't open.

48:20.981 --> 48:24.483
- God! I hate it when they do that!
- Do what?

48:24.484 --> 48:29.239
They wait till you put your face
to the glass, then give you...

48:29.281 --> 48:31.449
...a big, fat "boo!"

48:31.450 --> 48:33.326
Don't do that!

48:38.957 --> 48:40.667
See it?

48:40.834 --> 48:42.960
- It's, it's...
- A ghost!

48:42.961 --> 48:47.506
Just like I've been saying all night!
Finally, a believer!

48:47.507 --> 48:51.010
Ghosts are always around us.
Most can't hurt us.

48:51.011 --> 48:55.306
Most don't want to. Ghosts here,
ghosts there, no one cares.

48:55.307 --> 48:57.975
There are exceptions, like this guy.

48:57.976 --> 49:01.270
Those who die violently
remain tortured.

49:01.271 --> 49:04.524
- That's all they know.
- What's he doing?

49:04.858 --> 49:09.028
I don't know. I can't see.
I don't have the glasses.

49:11.156 --> 49:14.033
I've had it with this.
It's time to go.

49:14.034 --> 49:16.870
- Now! Please.
- Don't touch me.

49:17.204 --> 49:19.414
Will you come on?!

49:24.711 --> 49:28.047
Come on, ghost boy! Move your ass!

49:30.384 --> 49:33.720
Dad, slow down.
We're gonna get lost.

50:03.083 --> 50:06.586
Dad. Listen to me.

50:06.962 --> 50:11.591
He's gonna be okay.
We're gonna find him.

50:12.426 --> 50:15.094
So ready to leave this place.

50:15.762 --> 50:18.556
- Oh, boy.
- What?

50:18.557 --> 50:21.767
- The symbol of The Jackal.
- What's that?

50:21.768 --> 50:26.147
It's the Charlie Manson of ghosts.
If he's out, screw the kid.

50:26.148 --> 50:28.399
We gotta get out of here.

50:28.650 --> 50:31.610
Maybe Rafkin was right.
Maybe there...

50:31.611 --> 50:33.363
Kathy!

50:34.156 --> 50:37.283
Think about what you're saying.

50:37.743 --> 50:41.496
There's no such thing as ghosts.

50:55.969 --> 50:58.555
Kathy!

51:10.317 --> 51:14.320
What is it?! I can't see it!
Tell me where it is!

51:14.321 --> 51:15.989
Get off!

51:18.241 --> 51:20.410
Hold on! Stay with me!

51:30.837 --> 51:32.088
Pull!

51:32.089 --> 51:35.550
- Who are you?
- Never mind! Just pull!

51:36.843 --> 51:40.680
Shit! Don't speak. Don't move.

51:41.640 --> 51:45.768
Somehow, we got behind
enemy lines.

51:54.611 --> 51:56.195
Hurry!

51:56.196 --> 51:58.031
Please hurry!

51:59.699 --> 52:02.618
Hey, little guy. How.

52:02.619 --> 52:04.703
- Don't tease ghosts.
- Shut up.

52:04.704 --> 52:07.790
You shut up.
You keep pissing them off.

52:08.041 --> 52:11.210
Go. Go, go, go.

52:15.549 --> 52:17.216
- Maggie!
- What?

52:23.431 --> 52:26.433
Where?
I can't see without the glasses!

52:26.434 --> 52:30.229
I can see.
And I think you should go this way!

52:31.148 --> 52:33.232
Go, go, go, go!

52:35.735 --> 52:38.404
It's all right. I've got you.

52:39.948 --> 52:43.576
- Look at me.
- Daddy!

52:43.577 --> 52:45.745
It's okay.

52:55.755 --> 53:00.927
Who the hell are you?
And what the hell was that?!

53:00.969 --> 53:05.014
My name is Kalina Oretzia.
I'm a spirit reclaimer.

53:05.015 --> 53:08.017
- What?
- I free trapped souls. Cyrus...

53:08.018 --> 53:11.604
Forget Cyrus and trapped souls
for a second.

53:11.605 --> 53:14.023
What are you doing here?

53:14.024 --> 53:17.360
Looks to me like
I'm saving your ass.

53:18.695 --> 53:22.407
Oh, my God! It's over there!

53:22.490 --> 53:26.285
Give him your glasses. Come on!

53:39.966 --> 53:41.801
Oh, my God.

53:44.137 --> 53:45.971
Unbelievable.

53:45.972 --> 53:48.641
Another one of Cyrus' victims.

53:48.642 --> 53:52.812
I hope to God the barrier spells hold.

53:52.847 --> 53:54.522
Victims?

53:54.648 --> 53:57.149
Cyrus liked to enslave souls.

53:57.150 --> 54:00.444
That's why I'm here.
I'm gonna free them.

54:00.445 --> 54:02.154
Listen.

54:02.155 --> 54:06.617
I need to know how you got in here.

54:06.618 --> 54:09.828
Through an opening
when the house shifted.

54:09.829 --> 54:14.166
- Opening where?
- It's closed now. It won't open again.

54:14.167 --> 54:17.336
Let me show you.
This is the Arcanum.

54:17.337 --> 54:19.755
Many died looking for this book.

54:19.756 --> 54:23.175
A 15th-century astrologer,
Basileus, wrote it.

54:23.176 --> 54:26.470
He describes the making
of a machine...

54:26.471 --> 54:28.681
...that can see the future.

54:28.682 --> 54:31.850
He wrote it while
possessed by a demon.

54:31.851 --> 54:34.186
I can't believe Cyrus built it.

54:34.187 --> 54:37.690
Built what?
What are you talking about?

54:37.691 --> 54:39.358
Basileus' device.

54:39.359 --> 54:42.611
We're in a machine,
designed by the devil...

54:42.612 --> 54:44.780
...and powered by the dead.

54:44.781 --> 54:46.866
Listen to me.

54:47.701 --> 54:52.371
I don't give a shit about any machine
or devil or Basileus...

54:52.372 --> 54:57.376
...or anything,
except getting my family out of here.

54:57.460 --> 55:01.547
I came to set the souls
in this house free.

55:01.589 --> 55:04.884
You want help,
you gotta help me first.

55:06.219 --> 55:08.304
Kathy, can you walk?

55:11.641 --> 55:14.059
This can't be happening!

55:14.060 --> 55:17.062
- We have to leave.
- Not without my kids.

55:17.063 --> 55:19.732
Try telling him that.

55:25.822 --> 55:27.532
Come on.

55:38.376 --> 55:41.128
This way. Come on, come on.

55:42.547 --> 55:45.258
Stairs. Let's go.

55:46.092 --> 55:49.095
Go, go, go. You go, go, go.

55:50.430 --> 55:52.389
Don't touch me!

55:52.390 --> 55:54.308
Wait! The glasses!

55:54.309 --> 55:56.519
You'll need these! Catch!

56:06.154 --> 56:09.240
- Good job.
- Sorry.

56:16.289 --> 56:18.290
Perfect, another dead end.

56:18.291 --> 56:21.210
We found the stairs.
How do we get there?

56:21.211 --> 56:23.587
- Get away.
- What do we do now?

56:23.588 --> 56:25.422
Get away from the glass.

56:25.423 --> 56:28.175
- Why?
- Just do it.

56:51.032 --> 56:52.742
Glasses.

56:58.581 --> 57:00.207
Duck!

57:00.208 --> 57:02.292
- What?
- Move! Go left!

57:02.293 --> 57:06.004
Do something!
We're running out of corridors!

57:06.005 --> 57:08.966
Duck! Go right!

57:10.802 --> 57:12.345
Get down!

57:17.267 --> 57:21.228
We go to the library.
It has spell protection around it.

57:21.229 --> 57:24.649
Okay. Where's that from here?

57:42.000 --> 57:45.002
Can I rely on you
not to get me killed?

57:45.003 --> 57:47.296
I guarantee nothing.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.728
See anything?

58:06.065 --> 58:09.026
- Anything?
- No.

58:09.903 --> 58:11.737
- Come on.
- Okay.

58:11.738 --> 58:15.616
You know, I think they're
just downstairs.

58:17.952 --> 58:20.413
Nothing.

58:22.332 --> 58:27.128
If we get out of this alive,
I've gotta get a raise.

58:27.545 --> 58:29.505
That's a big "if".

58:32.425 --> 58:33.926
Give me a flare.

58:36.638 --> 58:40.933
What's wrong? Don't start
freaking out now. Come on.

58:49.776 --> 58:51.652
What?

58:54.280 --> 58:56.782
- Okay. What?
- Shut up!

58:56.783 --> 58:58.576
Give me the book.

59:01.829 --> 59:04.582
Just back up.

59:05.959 --> 59:07.876
- Go slow.
- Okay.

59:07.877 --> 59:09.628
- Going slow.
- Slow.

59:10.296 --> 59:12.339
Go! Go! Go!

59:12.340 --> 59:14.133
Fast!

59:17.595 --> 59:19.304
- What?
- Who the hell?

59:19.305 --> 59:22.141
What are you doing here?

59:28.189 --> 59:30.357
Shit!

59:33.236 --> 59:36.197
Hey, remember me?

59:43.830 --> 59:48.166
- Thanks for taking your time.
- Down the hall, left, then right.

59:48.167 --> 59:50.586
- Where are we going?
- Trust me.

59:50.587 --> 59:52.337
- Arthur?
- Trust her.

59:52.338 --> 59:54.506
Okay, let's go!

59:54.507 --> 59:57.176
- Who is she?
- I'll explain later!

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.453
- What happened to Kathy?
- She disappeared.

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:10.332
How do you lose an entire family
in a glass house?

01:01:20.259 --> 01:01:21.927
Arthur!

01:01:24.889 --> 01:01:26.807
Kalina, the flare!

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:36.608
Get him! Go, go! Arthur, get up!

01:01:36.609 --> 01:01:40.070
This is not the time to be a girl!
Run! Go!

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:43.865
Stop dragging your ass! Go, go, go!

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:46.326
Go! Run!

01:01:46.327 --> 01:01:49.579
Now is not the time
to sit around, Arthur! Run!

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.498
Close the door! Go!

01:01:56.003 --> 01:01:58.922
Arthur, are you all right?

01:01:58.923 --> 01:02:02.343
God, what's going on here?

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:04.386
I hate this job.

01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:07.932
They don't like you either.
I wonder why.

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:12.436
You got something to say?

01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:15.772
Let's start with:
This is all your fault!

01:02:15.773 --> 01:02:18.650
You caught them,
now we're running.

01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:20.527
His uncle built the house!

01:02:20.528 --> 01:02:26.075
You helped him. How could you
without knowing what he was doing?

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.913
- I had my reasons.
- Money, you parasite.

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:35.751
You stole people's souls for money!
That's depraved!

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:38.920
If you haven't noticed,
I'm a bit of a freak!

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:42.591
I go near anything dead,
I go into seizures.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:47.554
I touch somebody, and a whole life
flashes in front of my eyes.

01:02:47.555 --> 01:02:53.268
So, yeah, I'm depraved. And Cyrus
is my friend, and he accepted me.

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:56.272
He did not. You're so pathetic!

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:59.858
- He used you.
- Shut up, both of you.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:04.780
Cut him some slack.
What difference does it make?

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:07.824
You didn't tell him, did you?

01:03:07.825 --> 01:03:13.497
- Tell me what? What now?
- About the fourth ghost.

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:20.713
- No, don't do this. I didn't tell him.
- He has a right to know.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:24.717
What about the fourth ghost?

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:28.387
St. Luke's Hospital. Six months ago.

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:43.319
You're saying my wife's spirit
is trapped in this house?

01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:47.323
I didn't know you.

01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:52.536
I didn't know her.
I didn't know she had a husband.

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:59.209
Why? In God's name, why?
Tell me, why her?

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:02.754
Cyrus picked them all,
including your wife.

01:04:02.755 --> 01:04:05.048
I've been trying to help you.

01:04:05.049 --> 01:04:09.678
You call this help?! She's right!
This is all your fault!

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:12.723
- Son of a bitch!
- Arthur.

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:16.852
You can save her. And your kids too.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:20.522
Just listen to me, and believe me.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.776
This house is not a house.

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:25.903
It is a machine.

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:32.367
It's a complete and faithful
re-creation of Basileus' design.

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:36.454
There should be 12 spirits
trapped inside.

01:04:36.455 --> 01:04:39.749
See these?
They represent the black zodiac.

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:43.879
They are ghosts Cyrus needed
to catch. The First Born Son.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.547
<i>I wanna play.</i>

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:48.717
The Torso.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.805
The Bound Woman.

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:57.059
The Withered Lover.

01:04:58.477 --> 01:05:00.187
Jean.

01:05:05.943 --> 01:05:08.779
<i>Bobby, I love you.</i>

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.825
The Torn Prince.

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:17.246
The Angry Princess.

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.624
The Pilgrimess.

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:24.211
The Great Child and Dire Mother.

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:28.132
The Hammer.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:34.471
And here, the sign of hell's winter,
The Jackal.

01:05:37.141 --> 01:05:39.268
And The Juggernaut.

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:46.733
The machine required the energy
of these spirits to bring it to life.

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:50.111
Then the spirits are released
one by one.

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:54.532
The house draws them to its
centre. Each adds its energy...

01:05:54.533 --> 01:05:57.118
...powering it up.

01:05:57.119 --> 01:06:01.373
<i>- Powering it up for what?
- To open the Ocularis Infernum.</i>

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:04.626
- Ocularis, what's that?
- It's Latin.

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:09.673
Ocuiaris... The eye of hell?

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:10.966
Very good.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:15.303
I'm stuck in a glass house
with crazy white people...

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:16.680
Go on.

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:20.016
In hell, there's an eye
that sees everything...

01:06:20.017 --> 01:06:22.394
...the blessed and the damned.

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:26.564
If knowledge is power,
the man who controls the Ocuiaris...

01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:29.693
...is the most powerful on Earth.

01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:33.322
- Your uncle.
- Great.

01:06:33.864 --> 01:06:39.577
So how many ghosts
have been set free?

01:06:39.578 --> 01:06:41.830
Eleven, and the house needs 12.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:45.792
No, Damon said
something about 13.

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:50.922
- There are 13 ghosts.
- The 13th ghost is a fail-safe.

01:06:50.923 --> 01:06:55.677
To stop it, the house needs
a sacrifice of life, not death.

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:58.597
A willing human sacrifice.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:01.516
A sacrifice of the broken heart.

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:05.270
The only ghost created
out of an act of love.

01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:07.689
You're the 13th ghost.

01:07:09.775 --> 01:07:13.445
The 13th spirit stands before the eye.
As it opens...

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:16.698
...the spirit uses
the power of life...

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:19.242
...to short-circuit the system.

01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:23.621
- Uses the power of life how?
- By leaping into the eye.

01:07:23.622 --> 01:07:27.208
And Arthur's supposed to take
this leap? No way.

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:30.086
That's suicide. I won't let you do it.

01:07:30.087 --> 01:07:34.257
Come up with something else.
That's not working.

01:07:34.258 --> 01:07:38.637
- Love is the most powerful energy.
- Meaning?

01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:44.351
To save your children
you'd have to trade your life.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:52.484
Let me see this.
There's gotta be a better way.

01:07:52.943 --> 01:07:54.652
I don't read Latin.

01:07:54.653 --> 01:07:58.156
Well, we can try it
the old-fashioned way.

01:07:58.157 --> 01:08:01.076
Nobody'll be here to brag about it.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:04.954
We need a plan soon.
Time's running out.

01:08:04.955 --> 01:08:06.998
You gonna blow the place up?

01:08:06.999 --> 01:08:09.501
The last ghost
is about to be released.

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:12.962
I know why you feel
you have to do this.

01:08:12.963 --> 01:08:17.341
Psychics call it a linking.
We linked. I saw everything...

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:19.511
...about Jean, about you.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:23.765
Shut up. I'm not gonna listen
to this from you.

01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:28.144
- Kalina is talking about suicide.
- Anything to save my kids.

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:32.774
It doesn't make any sense.
There must be a better way.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:38.029
What does add up here, Dennis?
How much of this makes any sense?

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:41.198
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

01:08:41.992 --> 01:08:46.037
All I can think about are my kids.

01:08:46.162 --> 01:08:49.457
I don't even know if they're alive.

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:53.877
Let's go out there and find out.

01:08:53.879 --> 01:08:57.841
While there's still time, you and me.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.685
Kalina...

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:13.523
...no matter what I do,
or what happens to us...

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:16.651
...can you stop that machine?

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:21.698
I got enough explosives to blow
us back to the 15th century.

01:09:22.366 --> 01:09:23.950
Okay.

01:09:25.786 --> 01:09:28.955
- How many flares are left?
- One. Why?

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.622
We're going out.

01:09:30.624 --> 01:09:34.502
No fucking way.
You'll get yourself killed!

01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:36.462
Not if we take that.

01:09:38.256 --> 01:09:43.595
We got 10 minutes till
the ectoplasmic shit hits the fan.

01:09:44.846 --> 01:09:46.973
Go, go, go.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:54.439
- We'll go down to buy you time.
- After you, Captain America.

01:10:05.492 --> 01:10:08.829
Damn, I just got my nails done.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.997
Here, put these on.

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:14.126
Come on, let's go! Come on!

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:26.638
<i>Why did you leave me?</i>

01:10:26.847 --> 01:10:29.516
<i>Why did you leave me?</i>

01:10:47.576 --> 01:10:49.577
There's no place like home.

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:52.997
There's no place like home.

01:10:52.998 --> 01:10:55.208
There's no place like home.

01:10:55.209 --> 01:10:59.713
Knock it off, Dennis.
Just keep your eyes open.

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:02.883
Sure hope I don't bleed to death.

01:11:03.133 --> 01:11:05.761
That would suck.

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:09.222
Rotate.

01:11:18.482 --> 01:11:22.527
- Is that half the lawyer?
- Take this. Move it.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:25.989
Oh, my God.
He's definitely looked better.

01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:59.606
God. Shit!

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.527
Girl, hurry up!

01:12:30.929 --> 01:12:34.599
- Ram him!
- He's swinging for the fences!

01:12:44.234 --> 01:12:47.863
Kalina! This flare shit ain't working!

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:23.648
Where is it?

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:26.735
Where is it? Where is it?

01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:28.236
Kalina?

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:32.198
Why are you so mad at me?
I did everything you asked.

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:34.450
I killed Damon, stole his spells.

01:13:34.451 --> 01:13:37.745
I made sure your nephew
didn't get killed!

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.456
Kalina!

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:43.543
Where are the spells?

01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:51.176
You're not mad at me, are you?

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.803
Of course not.

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:56.597
- What is it?
- Oh, shit.

01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:58.600
Dennis?

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.734
- Only room for one.
- What are you doing?

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:12.029
I've wanted a reason
to like myself for a long time.

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:13.281
Don't do this!

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:17.035
Hey, bro.
You ain't nothing but a bitch!

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.956
Dennis, no!

01:14:39.349 --> 01:14:41.059
Oh, my God!

01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:34.570
What do we do now?

01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:37.907
Arthur thinks he needs
to sacrifice himself.

01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:40.576
He'll only do it
if they're in jeopardy.

01:15:40.577 --> 01:15:43.830
- Well, put them in jeopardy.
- What?

01:15:44.748 --> 01:15:47.083
- Why not?
- But they're kids.

01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:51.046
Greatness requires sacrifice.

01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:53.757
Now I have a job to do.

01:15:54.132 --> 01:15:56.593
And so have you.

01:15:57.886 --> 01:16:02.432
- Do it. Do it!
- Yes.

01:16:06.603 --> 01:16:09.814
And now to finish this.

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:07.831
Oh, my God, Jean.

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:12.210
I loved you so much.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:16.339
I miss you.

01:17:17.507 --> 01:17:19.551
Miss you.

01:17:19.843 --> 01:17:23.012
I'm nothing without you.

01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:35.983
No, don't. Don't go.
Don't go. Don't go.

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:38.153
Don't go...

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:53.168
Fetch the book.

01:18:02.386 --> 01:18:05.846
Cyrus! Cyrus! What are you doing?

01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:08.432
You just can't teach some people.

01:18:08.433 --> 01:18:13.855
I thought I told you,
greatness requires sacrifice.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.740
- Kathy!
- Don't look.

01:18:23.782 --> 01:18:26.618
I don't wanna look.

01:18:28.078 --> 01:18:30.747
Kathy, I'm scared!

01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:35.460
Hey, Kathy!

01:18:35.919 --> 01:18:37.629
Kathy! Bobby!

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.800
- Daddy!
- Bobby!

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:46.137
Dad, help!

01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:53.061
Oh, my...

01:18:57.649 --> 01:19:01.653
Make it stop, Dad! Make it stop!

01:19:17.502 --> 01:19:22.590
<i>This house is not a house.
It is a machine...</i>

01:19:23.717 --> 01:19:26.636
<i>...designed by the devil...</i>

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:30.139
<i>...and powered by the dead.</i>

01:19:32.642 --> 01:19:37.021
<i>There should be 12 spirits
trapped inside.</i>

01:19:39.316 --> 01:19:42.026
<i>They represent the black zodiac.</i>

01:19:43.695 --> 01:19:47.532
<i>Each is a ghost
Cyrus needed to catch.</i>

01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:50.702
<i>- The First Born Son.
- One.</i>

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:54.205
<i>- The Torso.
- Two.</i>

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:56.540
<i>- The Bound Woman.
- Three.</i>

01:19:56.541 --> 01:19:58.417
<i>- The Withered Lover.
- Four.</i>

01:19:58.418 --> 01:20:01.837
<i>The Torn Prince.
The Angry Princess.</i>

01:20:01.838 --> 01:20:05.382
<i>The Pilgrimess.
The Great Child and Dire Mother.</i>

01:20:05.383 --> 01:20:09.387
<i>The Hammer, The Jackal
and The Juggernaut.</i>

01:20:09.429 --> 01:20:11.347
Twelve.

01:20:17.771 --> 01:20:19.939
You're the 13th ghost.

01:20:24.444 --> 01:20:26.946
If I'm the 13th...

01:20:42.212 --> 01:20:45.923
You son of a bitch!

01:20:48.468 --> 01:20:51.846
Release my kids, you bastard!

01:20:55.767 --> 01:21:00.688
Damn you! You're nothing, Arthur!
You hear? You loser!

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:04.066
I dedicated my entire life to this.

01:21:04.067 --> 01:21:06.443
Every waking moment, for years.

01:21:06.444 --> 01:21:10.698
Have you ever shown that kind
of dedication? Have you?

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:14.451
The world has no time
for little people like you.

01:21:14.452 --> 01:21:18.122
It needs people who are
willing to do anything...

01:21:18.748 --> 01:21:21.125
...anything for greatness.

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:29.216
You don't have a choice
this time, Arthur.

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:31.636
You will make that leap.

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:36.098
The machine requires
a ghost to be created...

01:21:36.099 --> 01:21:38.601
...out of an act of pure love.

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:43.231
That's why I chose you,
you and your pathetic family.

01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:48.652
Congratulations, you get to become
the 13th ghost.

01:21:48.653 --> 01:21:50.363
Get on your feet!

01:21:54.659 --> 01:21:56.786
Come on!

01:23:02.102 --> 01:23:05.521
Trust me, Arthur. It's not over yet.

01:23:05.563 --> 01:23:08.733
You can finish this.

01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:11.944
You still have the power in you.

01:23:12.946 --> 01:23:15.948
It's just a matter of how you use it.

01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:18.701
Go to your kids. They need you.

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:28.628
Dad! Help!

01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:32.131
Daddy, don't! Don't do it!

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:41.891
Oh, fuck!

01:23:47.564 --> 01:23:49.524
Dad!

01:23:58.616 --> 01:24:00.952
Don't move!

01:24:03.788 --> 01:24:05.790
Keep your heads down!

01:24:07.625 --> 01:24:09.669
Hold on tight!

01:24:56.299 --> 01:24:58.551
Everybody okay?

01:25:00.553 --> 01:25:02.555
You okay?

01:25:04.974 --> 01:25:07.977
How did you know we'd be safe?

01:25:08.645 --> 01:25:13.565
I didn't. I just wasn't about
to leave you guys.

01:25:13.566 --> 01:25:16.944
I love you both so much.

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:29.957
Mom?

01:25:32.836 --> 01:25:35.087
<i>I love you guys.</i>

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:43.012
<i>I love you.</i>

01:25:55.066 --> 01:25:59.611
This is it for me! I am on
the first plane back to Newark.

01:25:59.612 --> 01:26:04.408
I am sorry, family, Kathy, Bobby,
ghosts.

01:26:04.409 --> 01:26:06.410
I am sick of this nanny shit.

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:10.581
I've had it! This was not
in the job description. I quit!
