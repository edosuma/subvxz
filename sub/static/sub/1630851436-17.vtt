- Guys,
can we have an honest talk?

00:52.185 --> 00:54.087
I get it, you're little kids,

00:54.187 --> 00:57.190
and when it comes to art,
you're kind of phoning it in.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.059
But what the eff
am I looking at here?

00:59.125 --> 01:01.394
Nelson,
is that the Statue of Liberty

01:01.461 --> 01:03.630
or Joy Behar
holding a flashlight?

01:03.730 --> 01:05.432
- You know what?
I'll take another pass at it.

01:05.532 --> 01:08.468
- Dakota, does that look
like a banana to you

01:08.568 --> 01:09.803
or a yellow Johnson?

01:09.903 --> 01:11.137
- What's a Johnson?

01:11.237 --> 01:12.806
- I'm--that is not
my responsibility.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.274
And, Tom.
- Hey there.

01:14.374 --> 01:15.942
- Yeah, uh,
if you draw another sunset,

01:16.042 --> 01:18.611
I'm gonna blow my brains out.
- Okay.

01:18.711 --> 01:21.648
- I try to encourage you kids,
but, Tom,

01:21.748 --> 01:23.983
you might be the worst artist
who's ever lived.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.318
- Oh, no, my mom disagrees.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.419
She said I'm like
her little Picasso.

01:26.486 --> 01:28.088
- This is the problem,

01:28.154 --> 01:29.756
these overly supportive
parents.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.157
- She's just saying I'm great.
She's just saying I'm--

01:31.257 --> 01:32.759
- I'm gonna say this to help,

01:32.826 --> 01:36.062
but Picasso had more talent
in his rear end

01:36.129 --> 01:37.997
than you have
in your entire body.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.666
- Nah, his rear end
couldn't even hold a pencil.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.000
- Sure, it could.
- How?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.735
- If he clenched
at the right angle...

01:42.802 --> 01:44.104
- That's a stretch.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.939
- His butt could easily
hold a pencil.

01:46.005 --> 01:47.607
- I don't think he could even
see the canvas from that angle.

01:47.674 --> 01:50.310
- Am I really having
this conversation? Ugh!

01:50.410 --> 01:53.613
- Oh, my God.
- Oh-ho-ho-ho. Oh, my God.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.115
- Mrs. Fern?
- What?

01:55.181 --> 01:56.816
- You seem really stressed out.
Are you okay?

01:56.916 --> 01:58.485
- Yeah, here's the deal,
you guys.

01:58.585 --> 02:00.353
Gather round.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.189
The arts program is at risk
of being defunded.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.124
- Oh.

02:04.190 --> 02:05.258
- So I need you kids

02:05.325 --> 02:06.826
to start showing results,

02:06.926 --> 02:08.428
or I could be out of a job.

02:08.495 --> 02:10.196
- We love you, Mrs. Fern.
We're gonna try harder, okay?

02:10.296 --> 02:11.865
- Your assignment
is to draw something

02:11.965 --> 02:13.466
that shows
your school spirit, okay?

02:13.533 --> 02:15.502
Could be a classroom,
a soccer field.

02:15.602 --> 02:16.870
- Can I just bang out
a sunset, or--

02:16.970 --> 02:19.139
- No! No sunsets!

02:21.107 --> 02:24.043
- Okay, Wendy, Tom's gonna
have fun with his art stuff.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.112
Got a date
with a dentist named Kenny.

02:26.179 --> 02:29.349
He's pretty boring,
but hey, free dinner.

02:29.449 --> 02:31.818
- I don't need to know
all that.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.354
- That's fair, Wendy.
Okay, guys, have fun.

02:34.454 --> 02:37.056
- All right,
have fun on the weird date.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.959
- Oh, hey, Tomas.
- I don't go by Tomas.

02:40.026 --> 02:41.528
- How's your art project?

02:41.628 --> 02:43.863
- My art teacher said
if Picasso would put a brush

02:43.963 --> 02:46.699
into his rear end, he could
paint better than I can.

02:46.799 --> 02:48.134
- That's terrible.

02:48.201 --> 02:49.736
Kids should be encouraged
with their creativity.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.905
- No, I shouldn't be.
I'm really bad.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.374
- Let me help. I'm an artist.
Let me just take a look.

02:54.474 --> 02:55.842
Okay, and--
- What are you doing?

02:55.909 --> 02:57.043
- Oh, wow.
- Don't touch it.

02:57.143 --> 02:58.511
Don't touch it.
- Ah, yes.

02:58.578 --> 02:59.913
- Can you stop? No, no, no.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.981
- Oh, wow, now it's popping.
- Please.

03:02.048 --> 03:03.650
- Oh, okay, the muse is here.

03:03.716 --> 03:05.485
- Wait, is this helping,
or are you just doing it?

03:05.552 --> 03:07.153
- The muse is here!
- Where's my mom?

03:07.220 --> 03:08.721
Where's the emergency number?

03:08.821 --> 03:10.390
You really have to put
the art down. I've gotta--

03:10.490 --> 03:12.759
- Tom, artists have assistants
help all the time.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.161
- I'm literally doing nothing.
I'm eating string cheese.

03:15.228 --> 03:17.564
- It's called
a stringed cheese, okay?

03:17.664 --> 03:20.433
You don't nibble on it
like some sort of monster.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.102
Okay, Tom?
- Yeah.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.537
- Now you are done.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.608
- Oh, my God, that's amazing.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.210
- You did that, Tom. Wow.

03:30.276 --> 03:32.445
- Me? I can't hand that in.
I didn't draw anything.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.915
- We were both here,
and the art happened.

03:36.015 --> 03:39.419
So, like, who's to say
who even did what?

03:40.386 --> 03:43.623
Oh, Tom, please,
don't eat it that way.

03:45.291 --> 03:47.594
- Okay, kids, I'm seeing signs
of improvement,

03:47.694 --> 03:51.631
but this is really not,
uh, "moving the needle."

03:51.731 --> 03:53.466
- Yeah, Nelson,
what am I looking at here?

03:53.566 --> 03:55.134
- You know what? To be honest,
I feel like this piece just--

03:55.235 --> 03:56.636
it's just really
getting away from me.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.871
- Dakota, did my whole
anti-banana speech

03:58.938 --> 04:00.139
not get through to you?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.441
- I'm just not
a creative person.

04:01.541 --> 04:02.475
That's the bottom line.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.576
- Yeah, no kidding.

04:03.643 --> 04:05.378
Wow! Wait a minute.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.647
Is this--Tom, you did this?

04:07.747 --> 04:10.783
- You know, I believe I did.
- Kind of blown away here.

04:10.883 --> 04:12.552
- I think your mean-spirited,
harsh criticism

04:12.619 --> 04:14.320
really, uh, inspired me.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.590
- Class, this is talent.

04:17.657 --> 04:19.926
Compared to Tom, the rest
of you look like idiots.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.461
- I wouldn't say that.

04:21.561 --> 04:24.731
- Tom's read end is a better
artist than some of you.

04:24.797 --> 04:25.898
- Enough with the rear end
comparisons.

04:25.965 --> 04:27.300
Not everyone reacts to that.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.968
- Tom, you are what we call
a prodigy.

04:29.068 --> 04:30.236
- No.
- And you

04:30.303 --> 04:32.405
are gonna save
this arts program.

04:32.472 --> 04:35.508
You are a hero and a legend.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.745
Hey, Principal!
Look at what Tom did!

04:38.811 --> 04:41.180
I'm teaching a genius in here.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.749
- She really needs to find
a middle ground

04:42.815 --> 04:44.517
with her feedback,
don't y'all think?

04:44.617 --> 04:46.185
- First of all,
thank you for coming in.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.122
And, uh, ooh, I hate to ask
this, but who are you?

04:49.188 --> 04:51.190
- He's Kenny.
- He's a dentist I'm dating.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.092
It's not a big deal.
He likes to tag along.

04:53.159 --> 04:55.528
- I'm actually a periodontist,
which deals more

04:55.628 --> 04:57.196
with the gums and bone--
- Yeah, okay.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.033
I mean, he's boring as hell,
but he's very loaded.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.301
Anyway, 'sup?

05:01.367 --> 05:03.803
- I am so excited
about Tom's talent.

05:03.870 --> 05:04.971
- Oh, no.
- I'm being told

05:05.038 --> 05:06.005
he's an art prodigy.

05:06.105 --> 05:07.106
- No, I'm not. No, please.

05:07.173 --> 05:08.541
I literally drew one squirrel.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.609
- Here's the deal.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.311
The superintendent of schools

05:11.377 --> 05:13.713
is threatening to yank our
funding for the arts program.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.281
- What? That's terrible.

05:15.348 --> 05:17.050
- And she calls me an idiot
in front of the kids,

05:17.150 --> 05:19.218
and I don't show it bothers me,
but it really does!

05:19.319 --> 05:21.020
- What a terrible bitch.
- That's insulting.

05:21.120 --> 05:26.059
- Yes! So I want to use Tom's
art to stick it to her,

05:26.159 --> 05:27.560
you know?
- What?

05:27.660 --> 05:29.462
- So--yeah, show her
that I'm getting results here.

05:29.529 --> 05:31.064
- Sounds like you've got some
personal issues to deal with.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.532
- Listen, Tom--

05:32.632 --> 05:34.000
- Can we leave me out
of whatever weird stuff's

05:34.067 --> 05:35.335
going on here? I just--no?
- Oh, Tom.

05:35.401 --> 05:36.703
- Yeah?
- Look at me.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.338
- Kenny, say something.
- Uh, you know--

05:38.404 --> 05:40.740
- All right,
it's, like, a tiny favor.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.241
- No.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.310
- Just draw me a huge mural
on the gym that covers...

05:44.377 --> 05:46.479
- Please.
- The entire rear wall.

05:46.546 --> 05:47.680
- No.
- It's of the school...

05:47.747 --> 05:49.082
- Stop.
- And it includes

05:49.182 --> 05:50.683
all the teachers...
- It's a nightmare.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.151
- With me on the front steps
looking heroic.

05:52.218 --> 05:53.753
- Kenny!
- If you draw it normal size,

05:53.853 --> 05:56.155
we can just blow it up.
Have fun with it.

05:56.222 --> 05:58.157
- I really think you're
overestimating my talent.

05:58.224 --> 06:00.059
- Principal, is there
any money involved here?

06:00.159 --> 06:03.029
- Go along with this, I'll slip
you a few grand on the side.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.263
- I think we're in.
- Oh, no.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.398
- You know what?
It pays to have

06:05.498 --> 06:07.100
an art prodigy for a son.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.434
- You know, some people say
periodontal work

06:08.534 --> 06:10.036
is an art form.
- Just be cool.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.371
- Kenny, be cool.
- Okay.

06:11.437 --> 06:12.438
- You should chime in
less often.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.506
- Please.
- Sorry.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.244
- Hey, uh, babysitter?
- Oh, hi.

06:18.344 --> 06:20.947
Weird, weird, seeing you
in a different context.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.615
Wow, okay, let me get there.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.050
- Can we just kinda talk
one-on-one?

06:24.117 --> 06:25.785
You know,
like, babysitter to baby?

06:25.885 --> 06:28.955
- Mm, I'm working but, uh--
- Real quick, here's the thing.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.390
I think you might have
overencouraged me

06:30.456 --> 06:31.958
with my art.
- Uh-huh.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.793
- Now everyone thinks
I'm, like, a prodigy of sorts.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.294
- Oh, I'm glad I could help.
- No, it's not help.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.696
It's a nightmare.
They've commissioned me

06:36.763 --> 06:38.264
to do a mural,
and I can't do it.

06:38.364 --> 06:39.599
I need you to do it again.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.968
- Okay, Tom,
I get paid for my work.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.302
Last time, I was on the clock.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.971
- You were on the clock
for babysitting.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.874
- Yes, it was a paid job.
- No.

06:47.940 --> 06:49.942
- So if you need me
to draw again,

06:50.042 --> 06:51.611
you're gonna have
to get out your checkbook.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.146
- Can I be honest?
- Sure.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.381
- I kind of see you as, like,
a second mom.

06:55.448 --> 06:57.984
- Tom.
- We're practically family.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.819
- You called me Babysitter
when you came in.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.622
- I call my mom Mom.
I don't call her...

07:02.722 --> 07:03.990
whatever her first name is.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.893
- Oh, Tomas, come on, please.

07:06.959 --> 07:08.494
I sat on your couch
for three hours,

07:08.594 --> 07:10.062
put you to bed, and then
smoked weed in your bathroom.

07:10.129 --> 07:12.098
So I think you're
vastly overestimating

07:12.165 --> 07:13.166
how tight we are.

07:17.837 --> 07:19.839
- Oh, this is not good.
This is not good.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.107
Oh, think, Tom, think.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.442
What would
Picasso's rear end do?

07:22.508 --> 07:23.776
What would Picasso's
rear end do?

07:23.843 --> 07:25.244
- Tom, what kind
of entrance is that?

07:25.311 --> 07:26.446
- Did I walk into your house?
I'm sorry.

07:26.512 --> 07:28.014
- Most people say hi or hello.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.582
You're gonna walk into--
- I don't have time for "hi"s.

07:29.649 --> 07:31.017
I don't have time for "hello"s.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.152
I need to create
an epic drawing

07:33.252 --> 07:37.290
filled with detail, texture,
and nuance of the school

07:37.356 --> 07:39.659
by tomorrow.
- So draw it. You the best.

07:39.759 --> 07:40.993
- I'm not the best.
- What?

07:41.093 --> 07:42.462
- I'm the worst.
- What do you mean?

07:42.528 --> 07:43.763
- I'm terrible.
It's all a lie, Nelson.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.031
I'm not a good painter.
- Oh!

07:45.131 --> 07:46.365
- The babysitter drew it
for me.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.767
- You know what?
That makes more sense.

07:47.834 --> 07:48.868
- You thought I was
a good artist.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.369
How long have you known me?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.038
- Sometimes it good
to have hope in people.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.806
- Am I too young to drink?
What do you have here?

07:53.873 --> 07:55.708
- Tom, Tom, stop!
- MARTINI & ROSSI?

07:55.808 --> 07:57.210
What is this?
- Look at yourself!

07:57.310 --> 07:58.644
You're spiraling
out of control, brother.

07:58.711 --> 08:00.179
- Do people drink Schnapps
these days?

08:00.279 --> 08:01.781
Is that still popular?
- Schnapps? Calm down.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.115
I ain't gonna let you
go this low.

08:03.182 --> 08:04.684
I got something for you.
Follow me.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.986
Screaming out, "Picasso,"
that's offensive.

08:07.053 --> 08:09.121
We're a Basquiat household.

08:09.188 --> 08:10.957
Yeah, my dad
is a big art collector.

08:11.023 --> 08:14.327
Feast your eyes.
- Oh, wow, now, that's art.

08:14.393 --> 08:15.795
I feel like I'm in the Louvre.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.730
- Yeah, don't it have
that feeling to it?

08:17.830 --> 08:19.232
- Oh, my--this is amazing.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.167
- If he dies, I get all this.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.735
Is your dad in all of them,
or is he--

08:22.835 --> 08:24.904
- Yeah, man,
and maybe this guy--you know,

08:25.004 --> 08:26.739
he does great work of my dad,

08:26.839 --> 08:28.508
so maybe he could do
this work for you.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.977
- You think this artist
would do my assignment for me?

08:31.043 --> 08:32.511
- Let's take a trip
to the arts district.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.146
- Shady Oaks
has an arts district?

08:34.213 --> 08:36.215
- Yeah, SOAD,
Shady Oaks Arts District.

08:36.315 --> 08:37.817
- Can you ride your bide there?

08:37.884 --> 08:39.252
- Yeah, you just go
over the railroad tracks...

08:39.352 --> 08:40.853
- Okay.
- Cut down by the junkyard...

08:40.920 --> 08:42.421
- Junkyard.
- Through the prostitutes.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.890
- Prostitutes, okay.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.158
- Once you make it
through drug dealers row...

08:46.225 --> 08:47.193
- We have--okay.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.728
- And go behind the Walgreens

08:48.828 --> 08:51.163
and cut through
the pedophiles' playground...

08:51.230 --> 08:52.765
- They've cleaned that up
quite a bit.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.167
- You're at SOAD,
the Shady Oaks Arts District.

08:55.234 --> 08:56.536
- Let's make a trip to SOAD.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.372
- Oh, wow, this

08:59.438 --> 09:00.706
really is out there, isn't it?

09:00.773 --> 09:02.441
- Yeah, come on.
I need you to keep up.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.210
- Are we still in Shady Oaks?
- Yeah, we're in Shady Oaks.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.045
We're just more on
the shady side of Shady Oaks.

09:06.112 --> 09:08.781
- Yeah, really a lot
of open-air sex acts.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.616
Oh, my God.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.084
-
- Don't make eye contact.

09:12.184 --> 09:13.519
- Yeah, look down.
- Don't make eye contact.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.087
- Look down.
- Oh, did you see that?

09:15.187 --> 09:17.623
Was that a speed bump or a rat?

09:17.723 --> 09:19.025
- Not much of a district,
is it?

09:19.091 --> 09:20.960
- Yeah, it needs at least
a coffee shop,

09:21.060 --> 09:23.563
if nothing else.

09:23.629 --> 09:26.065
<i>- Hi, are you the nude model
or the Chinese food?</i>

09:26.132 --> 09:28.467
<i>Either way, take off
your clothes and come on up.</i>

09:28.568 --> 09:29.769
- What?
- No, no, no, no, no.

09:29.869 --> 09:31.304
It's Nelson.
- Nelson and Tom.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.805
- My dad's the one
who commissioned a painting

09:32.905 --> 09:34.473
of himself on a horse.
<i>- Say no more.</i>

09:34.574 --> 09:36.642
<i>I smell money from up here.
Buzzing you in.</i>

09:36.742 --> 09:39.145
- Really an odd personality
for an artist.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.546
- Yeah, stay close.

09:40.613 --> 09:41.914
<i>- Hey, guys,
intercom's still on.</i>

09:41.981 --> 09:43.215
<i>I can hear you.
Come on up!</i>

09:43.282 --> 09:44.483
- Hey, we're coming up.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.619
Oh, wow, look at this studio.

09:46.719 --> 09:47.820
- Oh, that's nice.

09:47.920 --> 09:48.888
- What are
you guys looking to buy?

09:48.955 --> 09:50.489
More art for your dad?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.158
- Oh, no, actually,
we're not here to buy anything.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.759
I need a favor.
I need a drawing

09:53.826 --> 09:55.328
of my grade school...
- Uh-huh.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.163
- And we were hoping you could
kinda bang it out.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.798
- Yeah, look, look,
my dad would consider it

09:58.898 --> 10:00.299
a personal favor.

10:00.399 --> 10:01.968
- Yeah, kid, look,
I--I hate to break it to you,

10:02.068 --> 10:03.603
but your dad is a pain
in my ass.

10:03.669 --> 10:04.837
- Whoa.
- All right, I've been working

10:04.937 --> 10:06.172
on his portrait
for over a year.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.173
Look at this.
- Whoa.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.641
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, wow.

10:08.741 --> 10:10.142
- And he keeps asking me,
"More chest hair."

10:10.242 --> 10:11.844
- More chest hair?
- And I refuse to do it.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.346
- It's already a lot.
- I know.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.647
- Oh, please, come on,

10:14.747 --> 10:16.148
the whole Shady Oaks
Art Department

10:16.248 --> 10:18.017
is counting on me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.952
You go to Shady Oaks?
- Shady Oaks Elementary, yeah.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.320
- Yep.
- SOE!

10:21.420 --> 10:22.855
- SOE.
- My alma mater!

10:22.955 --> 10:24.290
Is--is the principal
still there?

10:24.357 --> 10:25.925
Chubby guy, bad dresser,
real idiot?

10:25.992 --> 10:28.194
- Yep, still here.
- Well, you know what?

10:28.294 --> 10:29.495
I'll do it.
- You'll do it?

10:29.595 --> 10:30.997
- Yes!
- That's amazing.

10:31.097 --> 10:32.598
- Yeah, in fact, you can
pick it up in the morning.

10:32.665 --> 10:33.766
How about that?
And when you hand it to him,

10:33.833 --> 10:35.101
look him in the eye and say,

10:35.167 --> 10:38.938
"Scott from the class of '04
says hi."

10:39.005 --> 10:40.039
- Okay.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.374
- And then make
a creepy grimace

10:41.474 --> 10:42.608
just like this.
Look at me.

10:42.675 --> 10:46.379
Eeeeeeeeh.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.880
You got it?

10:47.980 --> 10:49.448
- Can't just say you said hi
and leave it at that?

10:49.515 --> 10:51.217
- Just look him in the eye,
fellas, will ya?

10:51.317 --> 10:53.819
- Oh, Tom, Tom, we gotta go.
Our bikes are being stolen.

10:53.886 --> 10:55.287
- What? Oh, no.

10:55.354 --> 10:56.889
- This arts district
is only half a block wide,

10:56.989 --> 10:59.158
but it's
a terrible part of town.

10:59.225 --> 11:00.226
<i>- Hello, everybody.</i>

11:00.326 --> 11:02.495
Uh, Madam Superintendent,

11:02.561 --> 11:04.630
we do have
one last piece of art

11:04.697 --> 11:07.333
to share with you
from just our prodigy,

11:07.400 --> 11:08.868
our star student.

11:08.968 --> 11:11.871
Why don't you read a quick
artist's statement, Tom?

11:11.971 --> 11:13.239
- Oh, I don't have
anything prepared.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.007
I let my brushes
do the talking.

11:15.074 --> 11:17.176
- No, you just speak
from the heart.

11:17.243 --> 11:20.413
- All right, let me ask
you folks, what is art?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.081
Is it just something
babysitters do

11:22.181 --> 11:23.416
to pass the time?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.885
I believe art can come
from a child

11:25.985 --> 11:29.255
as easily as it can come
from a grown man's rear end.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.589
- Thank you.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.825
- All right, well,
thank you for listening.

11:32.892 --> 11:36.595
Hope you enjoy it.
It's called "Tom's Dream."

11:38.864 --> 11:41.067
- Oh, shit.
- What is this?

11:41.167 --> 11:42.735
- You don't like it?
What's wrong?

11:42.835 --> 11:44.770
- Can someone please tell me
what I am looking at?

11:44.870 --> 11:46.739
- It's just, he's--
he's with the school mascot.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.941
They're--
they just won a soccer game.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.843
- I don't understand
why you would do this,

11:50.910 --> 11:53.245
especially after
all my encouragement.

11:53.345 --> 11:54.780
- This is all my fault.
You know what?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.215
Why don't you keep
the five grand

11:56.282 --> 11:57.616
you were gonna pay me
for the painting?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.018
- Ugh.
- Wait.

11:59.085 --> 12:01.420
- You spent $5,000
of school funds

12:01.520 --> 12:04.123
on a painting of you
being humped by a squirrel?

12:04.223 --> 12:06.392
- He gave us the credit card
and said, "Go big, or go home."

12:06.459 --> 12:07.927
That's how much the guy cares.

12:08.027 --> 12:10.362
- Okay, obviously, he's drunk.
Let me explain.

12:10.429 --> 12:12.932
- Oh, no. I'm leaving.
And guess what.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.300
That mural is gonna become

12:14.400 --> 12:16.635
a permanent installation
in this school

12:16.736 --> 12:18.037
'cause I want it
to act as a reminder

12:18.104 --> 12:19.538
to future generations

12:19.605 --> 12:22.641
as to what a complete jackass
you were.

12:24.610 --> 12:26.078
- I feel like
we should have gone

12:26.145 --> 12:27.913
with Dakota's
yellow Johnson drawings.

12:27.980 --> 12:29.381
- I always thought
they were nice.

12:29.448 --> 12:31.117
Oh, and, Principal,
I almost forgot.

12:31.217 --> 12:32.618
Scott says hi?

12:32.718 --> 12:35.121
Creepy guy?
Class of '04?

12:35.221 --> 12:36.455
No?
