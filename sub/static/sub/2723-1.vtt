02:36.122 --> 02:37.856
Hello?

02:39.425 --> 02:41.160
Hello?

02:43.163 --> 02:45.430
Uh, <i> bonjour?</i>

02:45.432 --> 02:47.900
Hello?

02:49.269 --> 02:50.903
<i>Bonjour.</i>

02:54.175 --> 02:56.341
Hello?

02:59.213 --> 03:00.913
Nobody home?

03:16.563 --> 03:18.730
Hello?

03:30.577 --> 03:32.311
Anyone here?

04:14.621 --> 04:16.855
Excuse me.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.524
Hello.

04:20.459 --> 04:21.627
Hello?

04:21.629 --> 04:23.128
- Oh, God!
- Oh, <i> mon Dieu!</i>

04:23.130 --> 04:25.364
I'm sorry.
<i>Je suis désolé.</i>

04:32.940 --> 04:34.923
I-I think... I think it would

04:34.949 --> 04:36.975
be better for both of us...

04:36.977 --> 04:39.645
if you spoke in English.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.382
Yes. Good. Well, the door

04:41.408 --> 04:43.974
downstairs was open,
and I just...

04:44.817 --> 04:47.052
You're Mathias.

04:48.154 --> 04:49.921
I'm Mathias, yes.

04:49.923 --> 04:53.258
I actually call myself Jim.
But, uh, I like Mathias.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.726
How do you know my name?

04:54.728 --> 04:59.731
Maître Brinot told me
you'd be stopping by.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.301
The lawyer, Christophe Brinot.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.581
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, the lawyer.

05:04.607 --> 05:06.004
For the apartment. Yes.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.507
See, I inherited this

05:07.533 --> 05:09.508
apartment from my father.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.443
He died and left it.

05:11.445 --> 05:15.147
I'm...
I'm Madame Girard.

05:15.149 --> 05:18.250
Mathilde Girard.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.454
Okay. Well, um,
nice to meet you.

05:22.456 --> 05:26.525
Do you think, um...
Could <i> you </i> show me around?

05:26.527 --> 05:28.327
Could I...

05:28.329 --> 05:30.329
Oh, y-yes.
Yes, I could.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.997
Of course... I could.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.136
There are... There are quite

05:34.162 --> 05:35.967
a few rooms upstairs.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.669
Uh, y-yeah.
A lot.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.172
I went up there before I saw you.
Oh.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.441
No, I haven't
been up there in years.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.343
My legs are useless.

05:44.345 --> 05:48.280
Some of the rooms haven't
been used for, oh, 30 years.

05:49.649 --> 05:51.550
And this... this...

05:51.552 --> 05:54.052
is the Salon d'Hiver.

05:54.054 --> 05:59.024
Ah, in its time
it was a glorious room.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.227
We had wonderful parties
out there...

06:02.229 --> 06:04.196
in the garden.

06:04.198 --> 06:07.532
Wait. That garden is, uh...
That's part of the property?

06:31.691 --> 06:34.760
A garden like that in the middle
of Paris must be worth a fortune.

06:38.664 --> 06:40.499
That's awfully nice.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.608
A little out of tune,
but, uh...

06:52.079 --> 06:54.279
It's got a nice action.

07:02.054 --> 07:04.956
You look remarkably
like your father.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.592
Y-You knew my father?

07:09.263 --> 07:11.696
Did he buy the apartment
from you?

07:11.698 --> 07:14.966
Didn't you speak
with Maître Brinot?

07:14.968 --> 07:18.537
The lawyer. Y-Yeah, well...
I called him.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.572
Oh. No.
He doesn't...

07:20.574 --> 07:22.240
doesn't speak English.

07:22.242 --> 07:26.645
Not a lot, no. And I haven't
spoken French since I was a kid.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.782
So nobody's...

07:30.784 --> 07:33.985
ever explained the <i> situation.</i>

07:33.987 --> 07:37.656
Wh-Wh-What <i> situation?</i>

07:37.658 --> 07:40.559
Well, this...
this apartment...

07:42.495 --> 07:45.497
is a <i> viager.</i>

07:45.499 --> 07:47.499
Uh...

07:47.501 --> 07:49.734
Hmm.
The word <i> viager...</i>

07:49.736 --> 07:52.571
means, literally, for life.

07:52.573 --> 07:55.507
It's a French system.

07:55.509 --> 07:58.977
You know, for buying
and selling apartments.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.314
The buyer gets the apartment
cheaply, you see,

08:02.316 --> 08:06.051
for what we call
a <i> petit bouquet.</i>

08:06.619 --> 08:08.186
But then the buyer...

08:08.188 --> 08:11.289
must pay the seller a fee,

08:11.291 --> 08:14.192
you know,
until the seller dies.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.830
I don't quite follow this.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.633
Uh, m-my father...

08:21.635 --> 08:24.536
bought this apartment as an
investment 40 years ago.

08:24.538 --> 08:27.313
Oh, no, 43 years ago. It
was after my husband died.

08:27.339 --> 08:28.540
Forty-three years ago.

08:28.542 --> 08:32.844
He owned this apartment until he
died and left it to me in his will,

08:32.846 --> 08:34.679
which was just probated.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.716
You must have inherited
quite... quite a lot.

08:37.717 --> 08:41.352
Uh, no.
Some books.

08:41.355 --> 08:44.389
His watch.
And this apartment.

08:45.391 --> 08:48.126
In total?
Period.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.729
Where did the rest go?

08:50.731 --> 08:52.898
Oh, to who?
To whom?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.566
Oh, to <i> whom?</i>
Yes.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.968
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.838
I taught English for years.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.873
I mean, I've stopped...

09:01.875 --> 09:03.475
I've stopped teaching formally,

09:03.477 --> 09:06.211
but I cannot stop
correcting people.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.812
Sorry.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.814
So, tell me.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.783
Where did the rest go?

09:12.718 --> 09:15.320
Uh, he left his money
to charity.

09:15.322 --> 09:18.590
He didn't feel comfortable
leaving it to me. Oh?

09:18.592 --> 09:20.492
Except the apartment.

09:21.427 --> 09:24.829
The apartment and, uh...
Excuse me.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.666
And, uh, some, uh,

09:27.668 --> 09:29.935
French classics in French,

09:29.937 --> 09:31.937
which should be very useful.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.438
And, uh, that's it.

09:33.440 --> 09:37.108
So who's been, uh... who's
been collecting your rent?

09:38.110 --> 09:39.945
It's not rent, you see.

09:39.947 --> 09:45.283
It's a fee,
payable to me each month.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.619
I'm sorry.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.788
Payable <i> to </i> you?

09:49.790 --> 09:51.122
To me.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.391
Until you die?

09:53.393 --> 09:55.860
And not a minute afterwards.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.629
Thank you.

09:58.898 --> 10:01.132
Are you kidding?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.801
Hmm?
Are you kidding?

10:02.803 --> 10:04.636
Not at all.

10:04.638 --> 10:08.907
It's not a lot of money by today's
standards, for an apartment this size.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.710
2,400 euros...

10:12.478 --> 10:13.979
a month.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.714
And...

10:16.482 --> 10:17.983
I'm responsible?

10:17.985 --> 10:19.484
Well, I've been paid
to the end of the month.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.319
But when the new month
begins...

10:21.321 --> 10:24.322
So... what I inherited...

10:24.324 --> 10:27.659
was a 2,400-euro-a-month
debt?

10:28.394 --> 10:30.161
Well, it seems like it, yes.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.398
That's perfect.

10:33.933 --> 10:36.468
He got me again.

10:39.171 --> 10:41.473
Are you...
Are you unwell?

10:41.475 --> 10:44.175
A bit, yeah. I...

10:44.177 --> 10:46.845
I used the last cent
that I had to get here.

10:46.847 --> 10:50.081
This place was my last hope.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.983
Wh... This apartment?

10:51.985 --> 10:54.019
Don't you have an
apartment in New York?

10:54.021 --> 10:56.488
Uh, no, not anymore, no.

10:56.490 --> 10:59.424
Well, weren't you
planning on going back?

11:00.526 --> 11:02.861
The plan was to...

11:02.863 --> 11:06.464
sell this apartment and then,
I don't know, go somewhere.

11:06.466 --> 11:10.368
I don't know. Somewhere.
Just not stay in Paris.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.204
But you have
a plane ticket home?

11:13.206 --> 11:16.374
So, what you're saying is,
I, uh...

11:16.376 --> 11:19.611
I own this apartment, and, uh,

11:19.613 --> 11:22.013
I also own you.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.548
Yes.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.618
Yes, you own the apartment
and you also own me.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.053
Until I die.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.021
After I've died...

11:30.023 --> 11:33.725
Then I'll just own the apartment.
Exactly.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.560
How old are you?

11:35.562 --> 11:38.129
Sh... Sorry.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.031
Please understand.
I-I'm...

11:40.033 --> 11:44.202
I'm in shock. I...

11:44.204 --> 11:46.071
I'm completely broke.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.239
I owe everyone I know money.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.008
Except for a box
full of French books and

11:50.010 --> 11:53.244
this apartment, I have nothing.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.313
Didn't you have
anything yourself...

11:55.315 --> 11:58.516
before your father died?

11:58.518 --> 12:00.852
Oh, yeah.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.088
Yeah, I had lots of stuff,

12:03.090 --> 12:05.090
a long time ago
when I was married.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.225
Oh. You're not married anymore?

12:07.227 --> 12:09.327
No, I'm divorced.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.262
A couple of times.

12:12.498 --> 12:13.932
Three times.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.934
Oh. Three divorces?

12:15.936 --> 12:17.435
Mmm.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.271
One for each of my three
unpublished novels.

12:20.273 --> 12:23.441
- Any children?
- I'm sorry?

12:23.443 --> 12:26.678
Oh, children? No.
No.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.981
I'm 90.

12:31.283 --> 12:33.451
That's a big number.
Yes.

12:33.453 --> 12:37.956
I've been here since my 20s.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.891
Seventy years ago.
Mmm.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.926
I was born in England.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.763
And you stayed English.

12:44.765 --> 12:47.899
Well, when you're born
English, you stay English.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.135
Englishness...

12:50.137 --> 12:52.237
is so obvious.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.939
You have no choice.

12:54.941 --> 12:58.276
How old are you?
Sixty?

12:58.278 --> 13:02.080
Uh, 60-ish.
I'm 57 and 11 months.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.716
How did you get to be
57 and 11 months...

13:04.718 --> 13:07.385
and have so little
to show for it?

13:09.155 --> 13:11.156
Hey. Please.
Don't be subtle with me.

13:11.158 --> 13:14.325
If you have something you want
to ask me that's a little cruel,

13:14.327 --> 13:16.127
just ask me.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.829
I'm 90.

13:17.831 --> 13:21.466
Subtlety's not something
that interests me.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.035
Come with me.
Come on.

13:29.742 --> 13:33.311
Take this. You can
stay here for a while.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.313
Until you know
what you're doing.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.148
Thank you.

13:37.150 --> 13:41.486
I'll get the <i> femme de ménage</i> to
make up a room for you upstairs.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.455
Do you have any luggage?
Just the one bag.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.291
That's it?
That's it.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.961
I think you need some air.
Take a walk by the Seine.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.197
Hmm? The night
will be beautiful.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.766
Only don't...
Please don't jump in.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.768
You'll probably fail
to drown yourself...

13:56.770 --> 13:59.370
and just end up
with a dreadful cold.

14:00.105 --> 14:03.208
Dinner is at 8:00,
precisely.

14:03.210 --> 14:06.010
Don't be late,
or I'll start without you.

14:06.879 --> 14:10.014
I'm still six hours behind.

14:10.016 --> 14:13.384
I'll have to charge you
something for staying here.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.956
I always need money,
and that watch is gold.

14:20.559 --> 14:22.879
You're a pirate, Madame Girard.

14:24.296 --> 14:26.030
<i>C'est vrai.</i>

15:58.590 --> 16:00.959
Oh, uh...

16:05.664 --> 16:07.432
<i>Auguste Lefebvre.</i>
<i>Pardon.</i>

16:07.434 --> 16:10.234
Lefebvre.
Uh, I'm Mathias Gold.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.936
Call me Jim.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.839
Any chance you speak a little English?
Yes, yes, of course I do.

16:14.841 --> 16:17.742
A little bit, Jim.
Oh, good.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.744
I'm wondering
if you have an apartment...

16:19.746 --> 16:23.348
about 400 to 600 square
meters I could see?

16:23.350 --> 16:26.317
Oh... I might have
something, yes.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.519
Sit down, please.

16:31.357 --> 16:32.857
How big did you say?

16:32.859 --> 16:35.860
Around 400 to 600
square meters.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.528
Yes.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.330
With a little imagination...

16:39.332 --> 16:42.800
and a bit of money...

16:42.802 --> 16:46.938
this could be, uh,
<i>un vrai palace.</i>

16:47.539 --> 16:49.874
Masterpiece.

16:51.877 --> 16:55.013
Mmm. And, uh,

16:55.015 --> 16:56.647
this is, uh, how much?

16:56.649 --> 16:58.883
Oh, the owners ask 12 million.

16:58.885 --> 17:02.387
But I think you can make
an offer with enough...

17:02.389 --> 17:04.288
Twelve million.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.492
And how much would this be worth if
there were a garden in the back...

17:07.493 --> 17:10.528
that's equally,
if not bigger, in size?

17:10.530 --> 17:11.996
Why do you ask this?

17:11.998 --> 17:14.031
Actually, I'm...
I'm looking to sell.

17:14.034 --> 17:17.035
Ah. <i> D'accord.</i>
And where is your apartment?

17:17.037 --> 17:18.903
It's in the Marais.
Ah.

17:18.905 --> 17:23.241
Yeah. I inherited it.
It's, um... It's really big.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.909
I've got some pictures.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.877
Let's see.
See?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.713
It's, um, two stories.
Mm-hmm.

17:28.715 --> 17:32.550
It's about that long.
And this huge garden.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.252
Ah. This is good. Yeah.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.587
There's only one problem.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.923
See that old lady?
Yeah. She lives there.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.425
It's a <i> viager.</i>

17:40.427 --> 17:42.493
Uh, this is <i> not </i> good.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.162
Yes.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.431
No... She's 90.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.533
Not so bad.
Yeah.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.047
This French guy,
whose name I can't

17:50.073 --> 17:51.936
pronounce, he's called
me a couple of times.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.505
We Skyped while I was
still in New York,

17:54.507 --> 17:56.340
and he's really hot to buy it.

17:56.342 --> 17:58.229
Course I didn't tell him
about the old lady.

17:58.255 --> 17:59.277
I didn't know about her.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.271
If you see him, tell him
she's 90 right away.

18:02.297 --> 18:03.247
<i>Tout de suite.</i>

18:03.249 --> 18:05.750
Uh, good point.
Yeah.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.619
Do you have a...
a card?

18:08.621 --> 18:11.189
Oh, yes, yes. Of course.
Of course, uh, I do.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.194
Voilà.
Thanks.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.229
Uh...
I'll be in touch.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.064
Okay. Call me.

18:23.536 --> 18:28.473
I eat dinner each night
at precisely 8:00.

18:28.475 --> 18:32.977
And breakfast is at
precisely 8:00 a.m.

18:32.979 --> 18:34.479
I don't eat lunch.

18:34.481 --> 18:38.049
Lunch is not a meal
that interests me.

18:38.051 --> 18:39.784
Please?

18:41.286 --> 18:44.455
It's a 10-year-old
Gigondas.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.491
Should be lovely.

18:46.493 --> 18:50.495
Ten years is a perfect
age for Gigondas.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.063
Any younger,

18:52.065 --> 18:55.066
and the Syrah overpowers
the Grenache.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.235
Any... Any older,

18:57.237 --> 18:58.769
then the alcohol...

18:58.771 --> 19:01.939
overpowers everything
and everyone.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.409
You're very precise.

19:05.411 --> 19:09.580
Very precise,
Madame... uh, Girard.

19:09.582 --> 19:13.651
Precision is the key
to a long life.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.187
Precision and wine.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.655
Gotcha.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.157
I'm just gonna...
have water.

19:19.159 --> 19:23.995
I don't drink, uh...
alcoholic beverages anymore.

19:25.631 --> 19:27.665
You had a drink problem?

19:27.667 --> 19:30.434
Uh, it wasn't a problem for me.

19:30.436 --> 19:33.004
Just for the people around me.

19:38.143 --> 19:39.877
Mmm.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.047
A bit young.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.316
What a pity.

20:58.523 --> 21:01.092
<i>Vous parlez </i> to me?

21:02.628 --> 21:04.362
<i>Parlez-vous anglais?</i>

21:05.530 --> 21:07.999
<i>Cochon.</i>

21:24.383 --> 21:25.816
Whoa!

21:25.818 --> 21:27.885
Oh, God, I'm...

21:27.887 --> 21:30.621
What? I'm...

21:30.623 --> 21:32.657
You! I'm very sorry! I'm sorry!

21:32.659 --> 21:36.661
I... I had no idea that anybody
else was in the house! Stay back!

21:36.663 --> 21:38.829
I didn't see anything!

21:38.831 --> 21:41.499
You're, uh...
<i>Je suis désolé...</i>

21:41.501 --> 21:43.234
<i>C'est quoi ça?</i>
Calm.

21:43.236 --> 21:46.003
Mathias... Mathias, this is Chloé.
Chloé, this is Mathias.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.838
What are you doing here?

21:47.840 --> 21:50.074
Uh, I own this apartment.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.643
And I also own,
uh, Madame Girard.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.145
Do you work here?

21:54.147 --> 21:56.414
Chloé is my daughter.
She lives here.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.949
Your daughter... Why
are you staying here?

21:58.951 --> 22:01.519
Well, your mother,
uh... invited me.

22:11.864 --> 22:15.199
She seems upset. What, is she...
is she leaving?

22:15.201 --> 22:18.536
She's probably going to check the
rooms to see where you slept.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.504
Uh...

22:20.506 --> 22:22.273
She doesn't think you and I...

22:23.375 --> 22:25.509
- Never mind.
- Well!

22:45.397 --> 22:46.897
Oh! Hello.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.899
That's my room.
Can I help you?

22:48.901 --> 22:50.968
How long are you staying here?

22:50.970 --> 22:53.237
Here in Paris, or here
in the apartment?

22:53.239 --> 22:56.340
How long are you staying in this apartment?
I don't know.

22:56.342 --> 22:57.908
I'm paying rent.

22:57.910 --> 23:00.911
Why?
Wh-Why?

23:00.913 --> 23:03.180
Why are you paying rent?

23:03.182 --> 23:06.484
Chloé!
<i>Maman, s'il te plaît.</i>

23:07.753 --> 23:10.221
You don't have to speak
French in front of me.

23:10.223 --> 23:13.157
I can go to my room if you like.
Yes, please. Thank you. Do.

23:13.159 --> 23:15.326
What? Go to my room?
Yes. Please do!

23:15.328 --> 23:17.928
Your daughter has a
wonderfully welcoming spirit.

23:17.930 --> 23:21.532
I feel <i> bienvenu</i> beyond
belief in her presence.

23:28.174 --> 23:32.543
No, no, no. No French.
My French is for shit.

23:32.545 --> 23:36.347
Please don't be vulgar. Well, I'll try not
to be, but I can't make any promises.

23:36.349 --> 23:39.450
I know exactly who you are, and
I know exactly why you're here.

23:39.452 --> 23:42.686
Wh-Wh-Who am I, exactly?
And why am I here?

23:42.688 --> 23:45.389
Chloé!

23:45.391 --> 23:49.794
I had a Cairn terrier named Murphy
who used to eavesdrop constantly.

23:49.796 --> 23:52.963
He was, uh, 90 in dog
years when he died.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.965
Same age as your mom.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.802
My mother's 92. She
told me she was 90.

23:57.804 --> 24:01.472
She lies about her age.
She had me totally fooled.

24:01.474 --> 24:05.776
You have no legal access
here before my mother dies.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.212
If you continue
to trespass, Mr. Gold...

24:08.214 --> 24:10.114
Whoa, whoa.
Let's start all over.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.249
Hi. I'm Mathias Gold.
I'm from New York.

24:12.251 --> 24:14.452
I'm renting a room
from your mother.

24:14.454 --> 24:17.421
I've paid her...
I have no time for this.

24:17.423 --> 24:18.989
Simply and clearly,

24:18.991 --> 24:21.559
if you are not out of this
apartment by noon today,

24:21.561 --> 24:23.661
our lawyers will petition
the police to have...

24:23.663 --> 24:27.698
Excuse me, but, uh, I'd like to say
something, simply and clearly.

24:28.733 --> 24:31.569
This is my apartment!

24:31.571 --> 24:33.504
Yeah!
My dad bought it!

24:33.506 --> 24:36.941
And he paid for it over 43 years!
Gazillions of dollars!

24:36.943 --> 24:39.443
And then he left it to me.

24:39.445 --> 24:42.346
I don't care if your
mother's 500 years old...

24:42.348 --> 24:45.115
and the two of you
end up living in a tent.

24:45.117 --> 24:48.252
I own this apartment, and I'm
gonna sell this apartment.

24:48.254 --> 24:51.655
The moment I have the money
in my pocket, I'll be gone,

24:51.657 --> 24:54.492
and not a minute before.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.527
Okay?

24:56.529 --> 24:59.063
You heard what he said?
Hmm?

25:20.852 --> 25:24.154
Chloé, what did you say?

25:24.156 --> 25:27.525
I'm going.
I won't be home for dinner.

25:56.755 --> 25:59.056
<i>Bonjour.</i>
<i>Bonjour.</i>

25:59.058 --> 26:02.726
Um, <i> parlez-vous </i> English?

26:02.728 --> 26:04.728
Yes. Definitely.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.543
I speak <i> français,
anglais,</i> Dutch, <i> polonais.</i>

26:06.569 --> 26:07.331
 Whatever you want.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.333
Okay.

26:09.335 --> 26:12.269
Well, I've got some things
here I want to sell.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.572
That...

26:14.574 --> 26:18.375
Oh, no, no. No. I can't
really sell all this stuff.

26:18.377 --> 26:22.713
No, no... Well, I quite
like those '50s pieces.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.782
Okay.
I got four of those.

26:24.784 --> 26:27.017
Oh. Great.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.019
No, no.

26:29.021 --> 26:32.289
And the lamp. The lamp
could be interesting.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.959
That's art deco, that table.
Brilliant.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.261
How much for four chairs
like that,

26:37.263 --> 26:39.396
an art deco table and the lamp?

26:39.398 --> 26:41.632
<i>Minute.</i>

26:42.567 --> 26:44.435
Uh, 900,

26:44.437 --> 26:46.604
if everything
is in top condition.

26:46.606 --> 26:48.272
Everything is in top condition.
Yeah.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.807
This is why it's worth 1,300.

26:49.809 --> 26:52.476
No, no, no. One thousand
is my absolute maximum.

26:52.478 --> 26:54.144
Twelve hundred?

26:54.146 --> 26:57.047
You can deliver today?
I'll do my best.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.730
Brilliant. Pleasure doing
business with you.

27:20.672 --> 27:22.673
Um, my table?

27:22.675 --> 27:24.341
My lamp?

27:26.011 --> 27:28.579
I'll be right back.
Thank you.

27:33.118 --> 27:35.819
<i>Milles deux cents.</i>

27:35.821 --> 27:37.821
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

27:50.670 --> 27:52.369
What?
Uh, cleaning.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.038
Cleaning.
No, thanks.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.120
No. <i> I </i> do.
Oh. Good.

28:23.401 --> 28:25.736
Uh, th-thank you
for seeing me.

28:25.738 --> 28:30.407
I found you through, um,
Madame Mathilde Girard.

28:30.409 --> 28:33.343
Mm-hmm. You are
Madame Girard's friend?

28:33.345 --> 28:35.379
Friend? Well, you
could say that.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.047
Yes, provisionally.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.084
Um, I'm Mathias Gold.

28:40.086 --> 28:43.253
What can I do for you,
Mr. Gold? Are you ill?

28:44.089 --> 28:45.656
N... Am <i> I </i> ill? No.

28:45.658 --> 28:48.726
I was actually inquiring about
Madame Girard's health.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.828
Is <i> she </i> ill?

28:50.830 --> 28:53.397
Well, that's what I was
hoping to find out.

28:53.399 --> 28:56.333
I mean, she's quite elderly.

28:57.068 --> 28:59.069
Why are you asking?

28:59.071 --> 29:01.605
Well, if I can be honest, I...

29:01.607 --> 29:06.610
I own her apartment
as a <i> viager.</i>

29:06.612 --> 29:08.445
Oh.

29:08.447 --> 29:12.616
Well... you may have made a
terrible investment, Mr. Gold.

29:12.618 --> 29:16.420
When I last saw Madame Girard,
she was in top form.

29:16.422 --> 29:20.224
Top form? Well... Mm-hmm.

29:20.226 --> 29:22.693
French women
can live a long time.

29:22.695 --> 29:24.928
Yes. It's the red wine,
isn't it?

29:24.930 --> 29:27.297
Exactly.

29:27.299 --> 29:31.468
We had in France an old woman, the
oldest in the world... Jeanne Calment.

29:32.137 --> 29:33.637
Never heard of her.

29:33.639 --> 29:36.907
She was 122 years old
when she died.

29:36.909 --> 29:40.611
She sold her apartment in a <i> viager
</i> contract with her lawyer...

29:40.613 --> 29:42.412
when she was 90.

29:42.414 --> 29:46.116
Her lawyer paid her several thousand
francs a month for 30 years,

29:46.118 --> 29:47.618
until <i> he </i> died.

29:47.620 --> 29:50.788
A <i> viager </i> can be
a very bad gamble.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.422
Mmm.

29:52.424 --> 29:55.092
As far as I know, Madame Girard
is in excellent health...

29:55.094 --> 29:57.494
and could well
outlive Jeanne Calment.

29:58.663 --> 30:02.166
And you've been Madame Girard's
doctor for a long time?

30:02.168 --> 30:04.501
Madame Girard
and her daughter...

30:04.503 --> 30:06.737
were my mother's patients
for many years.

30:06.739 --> 30:08.505
Now they're mine.

30:08.507 --> 30:11.008
They're also
my English teachers.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.509
We exchange skills.

30:12.511 --> 30:15.179
I get private lessons.
They get doctoring.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.147
It's an excellent arrangement.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.082
Yes.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.585
You exchange skills.
That's charming.

30:21.587 --> 30:24.154
Well, thank you for your time.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.390
Not at all.

31:01.826 --> 31:03.327
I'll get that.

31:03.329 --> 31:07.631
Oh, no, no. No. The
trolley gives me balance.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.801
Oh. Well, I, uh,
just wanted to help.

31:10.803 --> 31:12.369
Oh.

31:12.371 --> 31:17.140
If I allow people to help,
they don't help at all.

31:17.142 --> 31:19.376
I know what you mean.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.650
So, when were you
last in Paris?

31:26.652 --> 31:29.086
Oh, I haven't been here
since I was a kid.

31:29.088 --> 31:31.421
Oh?
Why is that?

31:31.423 --> 31:36.593
I think it's because my mother thought
Paris was, um, the enemy, in a way.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.730
My father was here on business
all the time and, uh...

31:39.732 --> 31:41.865
I think, uh...

31:41.867 --> 31:43.686
You kind of got the feeing
that he loved Paris

31:43.712 --> 31:45.235
more than he loved
his wife or his son.

31:45.237 --> 31:46.837
Why are there, um,

31:48.273 --> 31:50.707
guns in my room?

31:50.709 --> 31:51.842
Oh!

31:51.844 --> 31:54.177
My husband's business
took him to Africa,

31:54.179 --> 31:55.746
and he loved safari.

31:55.748 --> 31:57.714
He was always game shooting.

31:57.716 --> 32:00.915
Ah! That explains the dead
animals on my wall...

32:00.941 --> 32:02.286
the pig and the cow.

32:02.288 --> 32:05.289
It's a wild boar.

32:05.291 --> 32:10.294
I can't remember what
else was on the wall.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.362
I wouldn't think it's a cow.

32:12.364 --> 32:15.632
Well, to me, anything
of that girth is a cow.

32:15.634 --> 32:19.069
Lucky you weren't here
a few months ago.

32:19.071 --> 32:23.240
You see, I've just sold most
of his animal head collection.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.542
Oh, there were animal
heads everywhere.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.878
Lions, tigers, zebra.

32:27.880 --> 32:29.780
Carnage.

32:29.782 --> 32:32.049
Yes.

32:32.051 --> 32:35.319
<i>Absolument carnage.</i>

32:35.321 --> 32:36.787
Ecch.

32:36.789 --> 32:41.158
So, what are your memories of...
of Paris?

32:41.160 --> 32:43.427
Uh, v...
Uh, not a lot.

32:43.429 --> 32:47.064
Uh, my father had
an apartment near here.

32:47.066 --> 32:52.102
I remember kicking a ball on a
courtyard with a concierge.

32:52.104 --> 32:55.405
Not with your father?

32:55.407 --> 32:58.075
Oh, definitely not
with my father. No.

32:59.677 --> 33:03.246
Was he... Was he
alone when he died?

33:07.418 --> 33:09.186
I don't know.

33:09.188 --> 33:11.088
He was in a home.

33:13.491 --> 33:16.360
It's a fear of mine.

33:16.362 --> 33:19.262
He's buried here
in France somewhere.

33:19.264 --> 33:21.031
They shipped his ashes over.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.933
Yes.

33:24.202 --> 33:27.104
Ah. <i> Fruits de mer.</i>

33:27.106 --> 33:28.872
Ah. Why not?

33:28.874 --> 33:31.708
I hope you like oysters.
Oh, yes.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.478
I have them specially
delivered on Tuesdays.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.146
Ah. Expensive, no?

33:36.148 --> 33:37.647
Not at all.
Not at all.

33:37.649 --> 33:40.450
I barter English lessons...

33:40.452 --> 33:42.452
with the owner
of the restaurant,

33:42.454 --> 33:44.721
and his wife
makes the mayonnaise.

33:44.723 --> 33:46.390
Ah.
Would you, please?

33:46.392 --> 33:48.058
Oh.
It's a Chablis.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.027
Ah.
1990.

33:50.029 --> 33:52.129
Remarkable.
Mmm.

33:53.131 --> 33:54.831
My private students...

33:54.833 --> 33:57.801
come here tonight
between 9:00 and 10:00...

33:58.569 --> 34:00.237
for English conversation.

34:00.239 --> 34:02.205
I don't think
we'll disturb you.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.874
Oh, I'm sure you won't.

34:04.509 --> 34:07.210
Well, good health.

34:08.413 --> 34:10.147
Long life.

34:18.255 --> 34:20.489
Which one?

34:31.768 --> 34:36.940
Now, today is Jean-Christophe's
birthday, so...

34:36.942 --> 34:39.275
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!

34:39.277 --> 34:42.212
Yes, happy birthday.

34:42.214 --> 34:48.618
And, uh, we say, "Many
happy returns of the day."

34:48.620 --> 34:51.455
Many happy returns of the day.

34:51.456 --> 34:54.757
<i>Bravo. Brava.</i> And what are you
reading, Jean-Christophe?

34:54.760 --> 34:58.261
I'm reading <i> Ulysse</i>
by James Joyce.

34:58.263 --> 35:01.031
Oh.
But it's <i> Ulysses.</i>

35:02.533 --> 35:04.034
<i>Ulysses.</i>

35:04.036 --> 35:06.369
<i>Ulysses.</i>

35:06.371 --> 35:10.640
- Can you?
- <i> Ulysses.</i>

35:10.642 --> 35:13.910
<i>Ulysses.</i>
Such difficult language.

35:13.912 --> 35:18.215
But well worth the struggle.

35:18.217 --> 35:19.416
Yes, Florence?

35:19.418 --> 35:22.385
What is the meaning
of the word "wang"?

35:23.588 --> 35:24.988
"Wang?"

35:24.990 --> 35:26.490
Well, it's, um...

35:26.492 --> 35:30.160
it's an Oriental dynasty.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.895
Why?
What are you reading?

35:31.897 --> 35:37.234
A <i> roman </i> by a young disciple
of Philip Roth... Philip Roth.

35:37.236 --> 35:40.170
Well, what is the context?

35:40.905 --> 35:43.406
"His blood-filled wang...

35:43.408 --> 35:45.675
was in her 'mouse'...

35:45.677 --> 35:49.346
when the tea-kettle whistle
whistled."

35:49.348 --> 35:52.449
Ah.
<i>C'est du porno.</i>

35:55.520 --> 35:57.287
Oh.
<i>C'est du porno.</i>

35:57.289 --> 35:59.589
Also, Florence...
"Mouth."

35:59.591 --> 36:02.159
"Mouth."

36:02.161 --> 36:03.660
"Mouse."

36:03.662 --> 36:05.695
"Mouse" is a little thing.

36:05.697 --> 36:09.099
"In her mouth."

36:09.101 --> 36:11.134
"In her mouth"?
Yes.

36:11.136 --> 36:12.869
Oh.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.554
Oh!

36:30.556 --> 36:32.289
Sorry!
Nearly done.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.124
I'm done!

36:34.126 --> 36:36.726
It's all yours.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.265
Okay.

36:48.573 --> 36:51.975
"Café Colbert at 2:00."

36:51.977 --> 36:54.411
Okay.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.213
So, if I can't sell my old
lady, and I can't sell my

36:56.215 --> 37:00.083
apartment, can I sell the
contract?

37:00.085 --> 37:02.252
Uh, <i> oui, oui, oui.</i>

37:02.254 --> 37:05.155
When someone can afford
a high-end apartment,

37:05.157 --> 37:09.426
they rarely want involvement
in a <i> viager </i> situation.

37:09.428 --> 37:12.862
Why is there only one toilet
in such a big apartment?

37:12.864 --> 37:14.931
One toilet is the French way.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.766
French people love eating,

37:16.768 --> 37:19.169
but pooing isn't so important.

37:19.171 --> 37:22.339
The old lady probably has
her own toilet downstairs.

37:23.507 --> 37:25.609
What if I get the Girards
to agree...

37:25.611 --> 37:28.111
to split the apartment
into two apartments?

37:28.113 --> 37:31.448
They keep the top floor, and I get
you to sell the bottom floor for me.

37:31.450 --> 37:36.853
No problem, if we can find a buyer
who accepts a <i> viager </i> contract.

37:36.855 --> 37:40.390
<i>Compliqué.</i>

37:40.392 --> 37:42.759
The French guy
I told you about?

37:42.761 --> 37:44.527
François something.

37:44.529 --> 37:46.963
He's, uh, very hot
to buy the apartment.

37:46.965 --> 37:49.432
And I'm meeting the daughter
at 2:00 at a café.

37:49.434 --> 37:52.469
I invited him to join us so I
can propose this split idea.

37:52.471 --> 37:55.772
I'd be anxious to know. Did you
tell him about the old lady's age?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.974
Yeah. Nothing seems
to scare him.

37:57.976 --> 38:01.478
Of course not. It's a
good age, a good address.

38:03.814 --> 38:06.216
Where do you live, Lefebvre?

38:07.952 --> 38:11.855
I live in the blood of Paris.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.802
<i>Your coat's torn.</i>

38:25.804 --> 38:28.204
Oh, yeah.
It is.

38:30.107 --> 38:34.644
Has, uh, François Roy
contacted you yet?

38:34.646 --> 38:36.079
"France Wah-Wah?"

38:36.081 --> 38:38.748
A man called François Roy
will be contacting you...

38:38.750 --> 38:40.250
regarding the sale
of the apartment.

38:40.252 --> 38:42.852
Yes. He already... He already called me.
In New York.

38:42.854 --> 38:45.822
We Skyped.
Hmm.

38:45.824 --> 38:49.259
Be careful with him.
He's a snake.

38:49.261 --> 38:52.862
Uh, Mademoiselle Girard, I think we're
about to have a little problem.

38:52.864 --> 38:55.491
It's a pleasure to meet
you face-to-face, Mr. Gold.

38:55.517 --> 38:56.299
As it were.

38:56.301 --> 38:59.102
What are you doing here?
This is yours?

39:02.708 --> 39:05.275
You invited him?
Just call me Jim.

39:05.277 --> 39:07.310
And remember,
I don't speak French.

39:07.312 --> 39:09.279
Not a problem, Jim.

39:09.281 --> 39:10.847
We'll speak English.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.882
- I'm sorry I'm a little bit late.
- This is an outrage.

39:12.884 --> 39:14.884
Did you not speak
to Mâitre Brinot?

39:14.886 --> 39:17.053
I have.
Several times.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.935
I want to propose something.

39:20.392 --> 39:23.727
This idea of splitting the
apartment into two apartments.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.995
You keep apartment "A,"
with the toilet,

39:25.997 --> 39:28.898
and I sell apartment "B"
to Wah-Wah.

39:28.900 --> 39:32.168
<i>Vous êtes un imbécile.</i>

39:32.170 --> 39:35.805
I-I-I don't speak French, but
I get the gist of <i> imbécile.</i>

39:35.807 --> 39:37.307
What about you?

39:37.309 --> 39:41.911
I'm only interested in the
entire apartment, as is.

39:41.913 --> 39:45.148
Then what do you
propose to offer...

39:45.150 --> 39:47.350
for the entire apartment,
as is?

39:47.352 --> 39:50.186
- What are you doing?
- You are very direct.

39:50.188 --> 39:52.489
Yes.
Well?

39:52.491 --> 39:54.257
Nine million euros.

39:54.259 --> 39:56.493
The apartment
is worth 12 million.

39:56.495 --> 39:58.194
Probably more.
I think not.

39:58.196 --> 40:01.731
Well, I've been talking to the
best real estate agent in France.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.200
Uh, several times.

40:04.202 --> 40:06.503
This man lives
in the blood of Paris.

40:06.505 --> 40:11.107
At the moment, the property
is a <i> merdier...</i> a mess.

40:11.109 --> 40:14.611
Both literally and legally.

40:14.613 --> 40:17.180
Okay.

40:17.182 --> 40:19.749
I'm prepared to
consider your offer.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.551
<i>D'accord.</i>
<i>D'accord.</i>

40:21.553 --> 40:24.788
Jim, you are legally within your
rights to sell the contract to me.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.857
Why don't you just murder my mother and me?
It would make things a lot easier!

40:27.859 --> 40:30.126
Can't you see
what you're doing?

40:30.128 --> 40:32.195
On Tuesday my mother dies,

40:32.197 --> 40:35.632
on Wednesday this man has me thrown out
on the street with no money and no home,

40:35.634 --> 40:38.802
and on Thursday the building that my
great-grandfather built for his children...

40:38.804 --> 40:42.539
and their children and their children's
children is destroyed by this monster...

40:42.541 --> 40:47.243
and turned into one of
those hideous hotels!

40:47.245 --> 40:49.312
It's all about the money,
isn't it?

40:49.314 --> 40:52.315
That's the speech you should
have made to your mother...

40:52.317 --> 40:55.785
before she sold the apartment to
this man's father, for money.

40:55.787 --> 40:59.489
My mother sold her apartment to this man's
father to keep it away from <i> your </i> father!

40:59.491 --> 41:02.492
Guys. Guys. You've got to
keep it down. Okay?

41:02.494 --> 41:06.563
Look, I just need a week
to consider your offer.

41:06.565 --> 41:10.266
But I-I'm gonna need
a good-faith advance...

41:10.268 --> 41:13.102
during the week
of consideration.

41:13.104 --> 41:15.004
I don't completely understand.

41:15.006 --> 41:18.321
You haven't heard a single
word I've said, have you?

41:18.347 --> 41:19.509
Quiet. Please.

41:19.511 --> 41:23.680
It means that I won't negotiate
with anyone else for one week...

41:23.682 --> 41:25.181
while I'm considering
your offer.

41:25.183 --> 41:29.986
But right now I need
a-a-a binder from you,

41:29.988 --> 41:32.956
a small bouquet in cash.

41:32.958 --> 41:35.625
How much cash
do you have on you?

41:35.627 --> 41:37.460
Are you serious?

41:37.462 --> 41:38.962
Deadly.

41:38.964 --> 41:41.464
Let's look in our
wallet, shall we?

41:41.466 --> 41:43.433
Really?
No joke.

41:47.872 --> 41:52.041
Uh, 360 euros.

41:52.043 --> 41:54.711
That'll do.
Okay.

41:54.713 --> 41:57.714
Well?

41:57.716 --> 42:01.284
You have my word as a New Yorker,
I will not talk to anyone else.

42:01.286 --> 42:04.621
And I will give you my
answer in one week exactly.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.324
This is unique.

42:09.794 --> 42:11.828
Uh, Mr. Gold.

42:11.830 --> 42:14.097
Jim.
Jim.

42:15.232 --> 42:18.468
<i>Chère, Mademoiselle Girard.
</i> Wah-Wah.

42:21.672 --> 42:24.073
Let me get the tea.

42:24.075 --> 42:27.744
<i>Charmant?</i>
<i>Garçon? Gendarme?</i>

42:27.746 --> 42:30.513
<i>Le cheque.</i>

42:30.515 --> 42:33.383
He plans to turn our building
into a hotel...

42:33.385 --> 42:36.753
like the two monstrosities
he has in Montparnasse.

42:36.755 --> 42:40.690
He has options to buy every apartment in
our building as soon as he gets ours.

42:40.692 --> 42:43.092
But until he gets ours, the
city won't give permission.

42:43.094 --> 42:45.595
So he really needs the apartment.
<i>Excellent.</i>

42:45.597 --> 42:48.698
It's not about money. It's about
preserving a historic neighborhood.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.600
Yeah, I get all that.

42:50.602 --> 42:54.604
But what is so wrong about my idea
about dividing it into two apartments?

42:54.606 --> 42:56.072
It's unacceptable.
Why?

42:56.074 --> 42:58.174
What do you want?

42:58.176 --> 43:02.111
I want to buy the entire
apartment from you...

43:02.113 --> 43:04.781
and keep it exactly as it is.

43:04.783 --> 43:09.285
And I'm prepared to offer you
3,000 euros a square meter.

43:09.954 --> 43:12.956
You're joking.
Right?

43:12.958 --> 43:17.460
Mr. Gold, if you had a heart or a
soul, you would accept my offer.

43:17.462 --> 43:20.129
The apartment
is worth 10 times that.

43:20.131 --> 43:22.131
You heard
Wah-Wah's offer.

43:22.133 --> 43:24.300
That was just his opener.

43:24.302 --> 43:25.969
Let me simplify things.

43:25.971 --> 43:30.573
By contract, we are due to
receive 2,400 euros from you...

43:30.575 --> 43:32.108
in one week, precisely.

43:32.110 --> 43:34.777
If we don't receive our money
in a timely fashion,

43:34.779 --> 43:39.315
our lawyers will instruct the court to
have your contract made null and void.

43:39.317 --> 43:42.385
<i>Bon après-midi, </i> Jim.

43:53.932 --> 43:55.898
Oh.

43:55.900 --> 43:57.400
Sorry.

43:57.402 --> 44:01.304
Come in. Come in.
I was just reading.

44:01.306 --> 44:05.441
Uh, I just had tea
with your daughter.

44:05.443 --> 44:08.578
Oh? Now, that...
that pleases me.

44:08.580 --> 44:11.280
Does it? I'm not sure your daughter
would share your enthusiasm.

44:11.282 --> 44:14.017
Oh, are you still
not getting on?

44:14.019 --> 44:17.120
Uh, not so much, no.

44:17.122 --> 44:20.857
Mrs. G, I want you to know
I'm trying to be fair.

44:20.859 --> 44:23.960
About the apartment?

44:23.962 --> 44:25.795
I offered your daughter...

44:25.797 --> 44:28.164
an extremely
reasonable solution,

44:28.166 --> 44:30.366
and she rejected it.

44:30.368 --> 44:34.270
This is something you
must resolve with Chloé,

44:34.272 --> 44:35.872
for obvious reasons.

44:35.874 --> 44:38.107
Why obvious?

44:38.109 --> 44:40.510
I'll be dead, won't I?

44:41.045 --> 44:42.779
Right.

44:42.781 --> 44:46.949
Well, anyway, I wanted you to
know I'm trying to be reasonable.

44:46.951 --> 44:49.285
Is your daughter going to be
having dinner here tonight?

44:49.287 --> 44:51.387
Well, ye... Well, no.
It's Wednesday.

44:51.389 --> 44:53.456
She teaches a night class...

44:53.458 --> 44:56.392
and she usually has dinner
with her friend beforehand.

44:57.027 --> 44:58.628
She has a friend?

44:58.630 --> 45:00.530
She has.
Mmm.

45:00.532 --> 45:02.265
Male friend?

45:03.400 --> 45:05.601
Yes.

45:08.072 --> 45:11.374
Has your daughter
ever been married?

45:12.576 --> 45:14.644
Not at all.

45:16.013 --> 45:18.053
Do you find my daughter
interesting?

45:22.986 --> 45:25.988
Are you a serious jazz person?

45:30.228 --> 45:33.108
Do you know I saw Django
Reinhardt play guitar?

45:35.266 --> 45:39.602
At La Grosse Pomme,
Montmartre, about 50 times.

45:39.604 --> 45:41.704
Or more.

45:41.706 --> 45:44.107
Genius.
Mmm.

45:44.109 --> 45:46.676
Seems a hundred years ago.

45:47.511 --> 45:50.346
Poor chap.
He died so young.

45:52.282 --> 45:57.620
I had a romantic liaison
with Django Reinhardt.

45:57.622 --> 46:01.390
Well, no, it was more
a flirtation, really.

46:01.392 --> 46:03.960
You know, just a fling.
A fling.

46:03.962 --> 46:06.796
You had a fling
with Django Reinhardt?

46:06.798 --> 46:09.465
Well, Paris was different
then, you know.

46:09.467 --> 46:12.902
It was just after the war.

46:12.904 --> 46:15.705
We were young and carefree,
in love with love.

46:15.707 --> 46:19.976
Every day was filled
with romantic possibilities.

46:19.978 --> 46:22.145
This is actually a fact?

46:22.147 --> 46:25.148
You really had a fling
with Django Reinhardt?

46:25.150 --> 46:27.550
I did. I did.

46:28.152 --> 46:29.786
You devil.

46:29.788 --> 46:31.487
That's very cool.

46:31.489 --> 46:33.756
Did you ever, uh, like, uh,

46:33.758 --> 46:35.558
date Sigmund Freud?

46:37.628 --> 46:39.695
No.

46:45.769 --> 46:48.337
I may not be back
in time for dinner.

46:48.339 --> 46:52.308
Are you going out? Yes, I...
I feel that I should.

48:29.339 --> 48:31.340
Mademoiselle Girard!
Oh!

48:31.342 --> 48:34.877
Fancy meeting you, of all
French people. Stop it.

48:34.879 --> 48:37.880
Stop it! Oh, it takes
great pictures.

48:37.882 --> 48:41.117
It doesn't work as a phone anymore
because I didn't pay my bill.

48:41.119 --> 48:44.453
It's also good for telling the time now
that your mother's taken my watch.

48:44.455 --> 48:47.456
So, where are you coming from?
Work.

48:47.458 --> 48:49.692
Really?

48:50.460 --> 48:53.195
You work?
I do!

48:54.197 --> 48:55.932
I teach.

48:55.934 --> 48:57.633
Really? What?

48:57.635 --> 48:59.936
What, "what"?
What do you teach?

48:59.938 --> 49:01.404
English.
Oh.

49:01.406 --> 49:03.906
Where?
Um, my mother's school.

49:03.908 --> 49:05.975
It's a bilingual
French-English school.

49:05.977 --> 49:08.210
We sold... She sold it. Ah.

49:08.212 --> 49:10.532
But you still work there?

49:12.150 --> 49:14.492
While the school still
exists, they're obliged

49:14.518 --> 49:16.385
to employ me. I was
part of the sale.

49:16.387 --> 49:18.387
Let me guess.
Your mother arranged that?

49:18.389 --> 49:20.990
She did. Yeah. That seems
to be her specialty.

49:20.992 --> 49:22.558
So, uh, tell me.

49:22.560 --> 49:25.661
Who's the guy
in the restaurant?

49:26.663 --> 49:27.997
What?

49:27.999 --> 49:30.099
The guy in the restaurant.
He looked familiar.

49:30.101 --> 49:33.169
I think I saw him duck into a
hotel with you the other day.

49:33.171 --> 49:35.557
But today he didn't seem
quite so happy to see

49:35.583 --> 49:37.740
you, what with the wife
and all, the kids.

49:37.742 --> 49:40.343
How dare you!
Oh, I dare!

49:40.345 --> 49:43.813
You give me all that holier-than-thou
crap about family and tradition,

49:43.815 --> 49:47.416
and you're doing the hoopie with
somebody's husband, some kid's dad?

49:47.418 --> 49:50.086
And I'm a heartless bastard because
I want to sell an apartment?

49:50.088 --> 49:53.856
- This is not your affair.
- Oh. Good choice of words.

49:53.858 --> 49:55.858
I'm just wondering
if it might be worth,

49:55.860 --> 49:58.027
say, 2,400 euros a month
to somebody...

49:58.029 --> 50:00.863
for me <i> not </i> to sit down
with that man's wife...

50:00.865 --> 50:02.798
and, you know, have
a little conversation...

50:02.800 --> 50:06.569
over a <i> café filtre</i>
and <i> pain au chocolat.</i>

50:07.671 --> 50:10.139
Please don't do that.

50:10.141 --> 50:14.543
See? Just when you think things are
really bad, they get terrible.

51:11.935 --> 51:16.572
"If you do not love me,
I shall not be loved."

51:39.596 --> 51:41.464
Ah! <i> Bonjour.</i>

51:41.466 --> 51:43.265
Yeah.
<i>Bonjour.</i>

51:43.267 --> 51:45.000
Uh...

51:45.902 --> 51:48.737
Uh, Mrs. G,
are you, by any chance,

51:48.739 --> 51:52.141
the charity
that got my inheritance?

51:54.311 --> 51:57.113
No. Not at all.
Not at all.

51:57.115 --> 51:59.181
But, uh,

51:59.883 --> 52:02.124
you knew my father pretty well.

52:06.756 --> 52:10.392
Your father and I
were lovers...

52:10.394 --> 52:12.895
since I was 29.

52:15.165 --> 52:18.501
If you want to know
for whom you are named,

52:18.503 --> 52:20.369
you are named for me.

52:21.438 --> 52:24.907
I am Mathilde.
You are Mathias.

52:55.539 --> 52:57.106
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

52:59.343 --> 53:02.223
The end of my wagonhood. Cheers.

53:22.833 --> 53:25.467
Midnight in Paris.

54:09.279 --> 54:11.847
What?

54:11.849 --> 54:14.283
Oh, there you are.
I've been so worried.

54:16.786 --> 54:20.122
You've been drinking.
Drinking, getting robbed.

54:20.124 --> 54:22.791
No wallet. No phone.

54:22.793 --> 54:26.729
My head feels
like a broken arm.

54:26.731 --> 54:28.697
I've been terribly upset.

54:28.699 --> 54:30.799
Well, that makes two of us.

54:30.801 --> 54:36.438
Uh, I'd like to ask you
some questions.

54:36.440 --> 54:39.475
I'll try to answer them.

54:41.044 --> 54:44.880
When exactly
did you meet my father?

54:44.882 --> 54:49.485
Just a few years after Chloé's
father and I got married.

54:49.487 --> 54:52.788
I knew. I knew when I met him
he would be the love of my...

54:52.790 --> 54:55.090
No! Spare me
the <i> fromage.</i>

54:55.092 --> 54:59.261
Where was my mother when this
was happening? In Paris.

54:59.263 --> 55:01.263
They'd just met.

55:01.265 --> 55:02.998
So...

55:04.234 --> 55:09.571
So my father married my mother
after you two already hooked up?

55:09.573 --> 55:12.074
We were young.

55:12.076 --> 55:14.843
My husband was
very successful in business,

55:14.845 --> 55:16.679
and your father was penniless.

55:16.681 --> 55:18.514
It just seemed the best plan.

55:19.316 --> 55:20.849
I...

55:20.851 --> 55:23.018
How is it at my age
I can still be shocked?

55:23.020 --> 55:26.155
Well, I'm shocked
that you're shocked.

55:26.157 --> 55:28.824
During three marriages,
you never had a lover?

55:30.026 --> 55:32.194
I'm sorry to disappoint
you, Madame G.

55:32.196 --> 55:36.765
Some people...
do the right thing.

55:36.767 --> 55:38.801
Well, why would you know
the right thing...

55:38.803 --> 55:41.036
and your father and I not know?

55:41.038 --> 55:43.672
What is so especially clever
about you...

55:43.674 --> 55:47.609
and your way
of understanding life?

55:47.611 --> 55:49.278
Ah, well.

55:51.548 --> 55:53.182
I know...

55:54.718 --> 55:56.552
my pain.

55:56.554 --> 55:59.722
See, I know the pain that you brought
into my life, and I don't like it.

55:59.724 --> 56:01.657
Oh, just stop drinking.
Why?

56:01.659 --> 56:04.293
It's only an escape.

56:05.328 --> 56:07.563
Bingo.

56:07.565 --> 56:09.231
Mrs. G, I... I'm sorry.

56:09.233 --> 56:12.735
I fail to see
the wonder of you.

56:12.737 --> 56:15.904
It's no surprise
that Max loved you.

56:15.906 --> 56:18.006
You're his soul mate.

56:18.008 --> 56:22.010
Max Gold was the coldest
son of a bitch I ever knew,

56:22.012 --> 56:26.348
and I have known some
<i>très connards froids!</i>

56:26.350 --> 56:28.317
I will not hear this.

56:29.586 --> 56:31.253
Wait.

56:31.255 --> 56:34.890
Wait! You will hear this
if I want to say it!

56:36.693 --> 56:39.194
You tell me
my father was Casanova...

56:39.196 --> 56:41.430
and St. John the Divine
combined,

56:41.432 --> 56:43.866
and I'm supposed to, what...
sit there and nod?

56:43.868 --> 56:48.003
But when I try to point out that my
father was less like St. John...

56:48.005 --> 56:50.005
and more like Captain Hook,

56:50.007 --> 56:51.774
you just won't hear it,
will you?

56:51.776 --> 56:55.010
Your father was loving, kind
and generous to a fault.

56:55.012 --> 56:57.913
Oh! I'm sure he was!

56:57.915 --> 57:00.015
With you, but not with me.

57:00.017 --> 57:02.918
And certainly not
with his wife.

57:04.788 --> 57:07.122
I remember!

57:09.225 --> 57:13.262
I remember being a kid
and watching... my mother.

57:15.365 --> 57:17.032
I saw.

57:18.968 --> 57:21.003
I knew. I knew.

57:23.640 --> 57:27.209
Look, I-I have no doubt that
what you're saying is the truth.

57:27.211 --> 57:30.145
But this particular truth
is your truth.

57:30.147 --> 57:31.647
Not mine.

57:33.116 --> 57:35.284
Definitely not my mother's.

57:38.154 --> 57:40.222
I don't have a friend
in the world.

57:40.224 --> 57:42.558
When my friends see me coming,
they cross the street.

57:42.560 --> 57:45.327
Oh, no, no. They're terrified
that if they get too close,

57:45.329 --> 57:47.596
they're going to catch
some loser virus.

57:47.598 --> 57:51.078
That's exactly what your
father said about you.

57:51.668 --> 57:53.669
Excuse me?

57:53.671 --> 57:58.707
That you drink too much
and you have no self-esteem.

58:00.643 --> 58:02.244
Exactly.

58:02.246 --> 58:05.314
I drink too much
and I have no self-esteem.

58:07.484 --> 58:11.286
Do people like you and my
father ever wonder why?

58:11.288 --> 58:14.156
Do you think self-esteem
is some kind of birthright,

58:14.158 --> 58:16.592
that the baby's born, and the
doctor slaps him on his ass,

58:16.594 --> 58:18.903
and he says, "Look! He's
got all of his fingers!

58:18.929 --> 58:20.128
He's got all of his toes.

58:20.130 --> 58:23.031
He's got his little dick.
He's got his self-esteem."

58:23.033 --> 58:25.033
It doesn't work that way.
No.

58:25.035 --> 58:27.803
If you wanna kill a kid,
you don't shoot him.

58:27.805 --> 58:29.371
You just do nothing.

58:29.373 --> 58:32.040
You just keep your distance
and watch the kid wither...

58:32.042 --> 58:34.877
and devote his miserable life
to trying to please you.

58:34.879 --> 58:36.812
To displease you.

58:36.814 --> 58:39.181
At some point, the kid decides,

58:39.183 --> 58:41.717
"Oh, I've just
got to stop trying."

58:41.719 --> 58:44.219
But you can't stop trying.

58:44.221 --> 58:47.656
You think everyone else in the
world is loved, but not you.

58:47.658 --> 58:49.625
You've got
this terrible secret.

58:55.398 --> 58:58.734
I can't imagine that my parents
spent a good deal of time...

58:58.736 --> 59:01.336
organizing my birth.

59:01.338 --> 59:06.208
I can only imagine my mother
desperately unhappy,

59:06.210 --> 59:08.143
sobbing in the night,

59:08.145 --> 59:11.480
my father, home from travel,
home from your bed,

59:11.482 --> 59:14.750
throwing in a little
midnight mercy hump.

59:14.752 --> 59:16.585
Then my mother's
pregnant with me,

59:16.587 --> 59:20.222
with this constant, permanent
reminder of this man!

59:20.224 --> 59:22.591
Just stop talking.
Just stop talking.

59:22.593 --> 59:25.561
You don't want to hear
about the other woman?

59:25.563 --> 59:28.096
Absolutely not!

59:28.098 --> 59:30.933
Just stop talking.

59:30.935 --> 59:34.069
Fine.
Now, I knew your father...

59:35.071 --> 59:37.539
better than any person
on the face of this planet.

59:37.541 --> 59:39.608
Better than your mother.

59:39.610 --> 59:41.610
Certainly better than you.

59:41.612 --> 59:45.614
And he was not your enemy.

59:45.616 --> 59:48.617
You just need someone to
blame for your misery,

59:48.619 --> 59:50.786
so you blame him.

59:50.788 --> 59:56.158
Well, your father is not the
source of your failure,

59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.295
not the source of your poverty.

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:03.098
And he's certainly
not the reason...

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.801
for your unthinkable sadness.

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:13.742
You have life left, Mathias.

01:00:13.744 --> 01:00:16.378
There is no greater wealth.

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:20.082
Now, I'm an old woman.

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:21.750
There is...

01:00:21.752 --> 01:00:24.119
There's nothing...

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:27.189
more tiring than exasperation.

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:31.326
And you...
you've exhausted me.

01:00:31.328 --> 01:00:35.564
Would you please...
please just leave me alone?

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:40.268
Fine.

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:50.445
You!

01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:54.016
You better start packing,
'cause I'm selling.

01:00:54.018 --> 01:00:56.418
I'm selling!

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.534
Excuse me, Jim.
Business.

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:14.737
Do you have anything
for a headache?

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:17.239
I do.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.641
Ba-ba-ba.

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:26.181
This works quickly.
Ah.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:29.317
I'm very pleased
by your decision, Jim.

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:32.454
Good.
When do I get the money?

01:01:32.456 --> 01:01:34.222
As soon as the contract
is signed.

01:01:34.224 --> 01:01:37.192
And how soon do I
get the contract?

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:40.228
Oh, is tomorrow noon all right?

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:42.564
Yeah.
That'll be fine.

01:01:42.566 --> 01:01:47.536
I'm gonna need another small
<i> bouquet</i> as a binder.

01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:51.206
3,000 euros.

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:54.676
You'll have much more than that
tomorrow when you sign the contract.

01:01:54.678 --> 01:01:58.146
Yeah, but I need
the 3,000 euros today.

01:01:58.148 --> 01:01:59.848
In cash.

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:02.017
I'm afraid
it won't be possible.

01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:03.552
Oh, well.

01:02:03.554 --> 01:02:07.589
Then I won't be able
to sign the contract,

01:02:07.591 --> 01:02:10.492
and you won't be able
to ever have the apartment.

01:02:10.494 --> 01:02:12.561
Cheers.

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:16.298
It is a threat, Mr. Gold?

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:19.601
No, Mr. Wah-Wah.

01:02:19.603 --> 01:02:22.571
This is a fact.

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:30.178
<i>Vous êtes Monsieur Gold?</i>

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.581
Wrong Monsieur Gold.

01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:34.483
That one's dead.

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:22.631
Tell me about these.

01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:25.233
That's Chloé, isn't it?
Right?

01:03:25.235 --> 01:03:27.169
Yes, that's Chloé.

01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:29.070
Your father took that
in the garden.

01:03:29.072 --> 01:03:31.373
You were beautiful children.

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:34.176
He brought you here once.

01:03:34.178 --> 01:03:36.478
Oh.

01:03:39.515 --> 01:03:43.685
He never came back here
after your mother died.

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:47.489
He wrote some beautiful letters
to me, but he never came back.

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:52.661
Mrs. G,
it's really not easy...

01:03:52.663 --> 01:03:56.932
for me to process this
fabulous love story of yours.

01:03:56.934 --> 01:03:58.867
I get that my father loved you.

01:03:58.869 --> 01:04:01.536
What I don't get
is that he never loved <i> me.</i>

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:03.505
Of course he loved you.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:07.008
He just thought you were more
your mother's child than his.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.810
Oh, that's sweet.

01:04:08.812 --> 01:04:12.814
What about when I was 20
and living on my own?

01:04:12.816 --> 01:04:14.649
Or when I was 40,

01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:17.385
near death
at Lennox Hill Hospital?

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:20.355
Six blocks from his house.

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:23.391
Why were you in hospital?

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:28.230
I had an accident.
I, uh...

01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:31.399
I was taking a bath,
and I, uh...

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:34.236
Well, my razor blade slipped...

01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:37.906
and cut both my wrists
rather badly.

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:42.410
You tried to kill yourself?

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:46.648
I'm not very adept.

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:49.517
You saw that right away.

01:04:49.519 --> 01:04:52.153
Remember the first day? You
said, "Don't jump in the Seine.

01:04:52.155 --> 01:04:54.456
You'll just get a head cold."

01:04:56.259 --> 01:05:00.462
Mathias, you must get help.

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:06.601
Help!

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:08.770
What sort of help
were you thinking about?

01:05:08.772 --> 01:05:11.072
Psychoanalysis?

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:12.774
I tried that.

01:05:12.776 --> 01:05:16.278
My doctor told me that I should
put the child that I was...

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.114
on the knee of the man
I had become...

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:22.918
and comfort the child.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.454
But I keep having
these dreams...

01:05:26.456 --> 01:05:29.958
where the child that I was...

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.693
is on my knee...

01:05:31.695 --> 01:05:36.765
and my hands
are around his throat.

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:41.303
Speaking of children, uh,
where is your daughter?

01:05:41.305 --> 01:05:43.872
Isn't she usually home by now?

01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:46.067
Philippe?

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:52.941
Chloé?

01:06:53.876 --> 01:06:55.710
I've stopped teaching,
Philippe,

01:06:55.712 --> 01:06:58.179
so you'll have to find
yourself another teacher.

01:06:58.181 --> 01:07:01.783
Um, but I hope you don't because
your English is perfect.

01:07:01.785 --> 01:07:04.052
And if you stop taking classes,

01:07:04.054 --> 01:07:07.522
you'll be able to spend
more time with your wife...

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:09.724
and your children.

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:13.294
Well...

01:07:13.296 --> 01:07:15.530
Well, um...

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.298
No. Chloé, don't.
Don't.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:18.967
Don't!

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:22.737
Um...

01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:28.043
I don't know what...
what to say.

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:29.978
Say good-bye.

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:33.314
Say this is a mistake.

01:07:33.316 --> 01:07:37.018
Say, "I've got two beautiful
daughters waiting for me at home.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.087
This is crazy."

01:07:39.089 --> 01:07:41.656
Chloé...

01:07:41.658 --> 01:07:46.294
Do you really want to put your
beautiful family at risk?

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:56.137
No.

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:10.912
Oh! Heavy date tonight?

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:13.413
Excuse me?
I don't think I will.

01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:15.917
Oh, I've got your rent.
Here you go.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:24.425
Uh, one, two, three,
four, five.

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:26.161
600 for me...

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:30.365
and, uh, 2,400 for you.

01:09:30.367 --> 01:09:32.600
Paid in full.

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:34.169
Thank you.
Mmm.

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:36.304
You better keep your mother
alive for a long time...

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:39.674
because as soon as she's dead,
there goes the neighborhood.

01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:01.696
How can soul "clap its hands"?

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:05.066
What?

01:10:05.068 --> 01:10:07.468
"An aged man
is but a paltry thing,

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:09.737
a tattered coat upon a stick...

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:14.842
unless soul clap its hands
and sing."

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:17.312
How can a soul clap its hands?

01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:18.880
My book.

01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:21.983
Well, all right. Fine.
So, in the face of that...

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:26.487
As it is your book,
I'll ask you again.

01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:29.390
How can soul clap its hands?

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:31.392
Don't know. Don't care.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:34.929
I don't care.
<i>Nique ta mère.</i>

01:10:34.931 --> 01:10:39.000
<i>Nique ta mère.</i>
I don't care.

01:10:39.002 --> 01:10:42.570
A Yeatsian couplet
in golden franglais.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:45.340
It's a pity my father
didn't know you.

01:10:45.342 --> 01:10:47.108
In what sense?

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:49.877
He would have had your head on the
wall next to the other beasts.

01:10:49.879 --> 01:10:52.247
Oh! In the <i> carnage </i> sense?
Yes.

01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:54.849
Isn't it lovely
when things make sense?

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:02.457
You think your dad
knew about my dad?

01:11:06.862 --> 01:11:09.097
How could he not?

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:11.899
And you?

01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:15.503
You-You knew
what was going on?

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:26.848
I was 10 years old when I
discovered what was, um, going on.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:30.518
That's very precocious.

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:35.056
I was 57 when I found out.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:37.992
Whoa.

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:42.497
So what did you do?

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:44.399
What did I do about what?

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:47.402
If I'd have known what was going on, I
would have done something about it.

01:11:47.404 --> 01:11:49.737
And what should I have done
that I didn't do?

01:11:49.739 --> 01:11:52.340
Stopped it!
I was 10!

01:11:52.342 --> 01:11:56.023
You could have told
your dad what you knew.

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:59.681
I hardly think
that was my place.

01:11:59.683 --> 01:12:04.852
And what would have been your
place, <i>ma chère demoiselle?</i>

01:12:08.023 --> 01:12:11.659
I suppose my place was
to watch my father suffer.

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.796
Oh, your father suffered?
Oh, please.

01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:16.831
What do you think?

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:20.001
Is that why he shot and
stuffed all those animals?

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:23.171
So he wouldn't have to shoot
and stuff your mother?

01:12:23.173 --> 01:12:26.474
Or your father?
Or my father.

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:28.209
Did...

01:12:29.211 --> 01:12:30.912
Did you ever, uh...

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:37.118
Did your father ever ask
you about it, directly?

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.554
He didn't need to ask.
He knew.

01:12:39.556 --> 01:12:41.837
But he did ask, didn't he?

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:45.493
Yes.
And you lied.

01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:47.195
And I lied.

01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:49.557
How often did they
see each other?

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:52.400
Often.

01:12:52.402 --> 01:12:56.037
And your mother used you for an
excuse to get out of the house?

01:12:58.807 --> 01:13:01.909
Why didn't your father
try to stop it?

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:06.981
My father was totally discreet.

01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:10.585
So, he suffered discreetly?

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:13.821
That's the way
French people do it.

01:13:13.823 --> 01:13:15.423
Yeah.

01:13:15.425 --> 01:13:19.694
<i>Vive la </i> French people!

01:13:19.696 --> 01:13:22.330
<i>Vive la </i> French people!

01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:32.073
Now, <i> that </i> is truly sad.

01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:35.176
I mean, all this we talk
about is, you know...

01:13:35.178 --> 01:13:38.780
It's got a kind of historical,
hysterical sadness to it.

01:13:38.782 --> 01:13:43.184
But this bottle is now.
This is now.

01:13:43.186 --> 01:13:47.054
This is
an incontrovertible fact,

01:13:47.056 --> 01:13:49.891
my dear, darling...

01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:52.193
Mademoiselle Girard.

01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:56.130
Bottle's a dead soldier.

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:02.136
Ooh!

01:14:03.873 --> 01:14:06.374
Oh!

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:09.710
Ah.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.615
I remember when I was 10.

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:18.820
I saw my mother out on our
balcony through our doors.

01:14:18.822 --> 01:14:21.456
She was leaning
over the balcony.

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:24.659
She was looking down on Park Avenue.
She was crying.

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:28.996
There's no question about what
she was thinking about doing.

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:31.999
She was leaning way, way over.

01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:35.770
And I knew I had about five
seconds to do something,

01:14:35.772 --> 01:14:38.506
so I ran as fast as I could...

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:40.174
right...

01:14:40.176 --> 01:14:44.679
And I put my arm right through
the glass on the door, and I...

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:50.151
I cut it wide open.
See?

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:55.456
My mother snapped immediately
into serious mother mode.

01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:59.360
She wrapped my arm up
in a towel...

01:14:59.362 --> 01:15:02.063
and took me off
to the hospital.

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:06.734
I bled for her.

01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:11.706
She bled for me.

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:19.981
Nine years later, I came home
one Saturday from college.

01:15:19.983 --> 01:15:24.285
I... I used the key
to let myself in.

01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:26.354
I threw my duffel bag
on the bed.

01:15:26.356 --> 01:15:28.022
I called,
"Hey, Ma! I'm home."

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:31.359
She called back,
"I'm in my room"...

01:15:31.361 --> 01:15:34.829
in this strange, throaty voice.

01:15:34.831 --> 01:15:37.465
I go in, and she has this gun.

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:44.071
Not a hearty hunting rifle
like your dad's.

01:15:44.073 --> 01:15:46.407
No, hers was a...

01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:51.412
snub-nosed, chrome
kind of pistoly thing...

01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:57.151
that my father gave her
to keep by her bed...

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:04.492
just in case an intruder were
to wander in while he was away.

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:08.663
My father.

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:15.269
She puts it in her mouth
and she kills herself.

01:16:15.271 --> 01:16:17.438
No words.
No complications.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:21.142
Just... boom!

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.081
Terrible mess all over.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.188
I sat on the floor.

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:37.191
I held her.

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:42.597
She died.

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:56.210
My mother said
she died from an illness.

01:16:57.879 --> 01:17:01.549
A bullet in the throat can
make a person extremely ill.

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:07.855
I'm so sorry.

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:25.573
She was wrong
to do that to you.

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:32.013
You're right.

01:17:32.015 --> 01:17:34.382
It wasn't very nice.

01:17:40.255 --> 01:17:42.523
I...

01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:47.862
I'm so upset.

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.509
No.

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:48.756
Hmm.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.094
Hmm.

01:19:01.369 --> 01:19:02.837
Oh.

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:08.976
Oof.

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:25.626
Chloé?

01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:34.001
I got it!

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:42.009
Oh!

01:19:43.245 --> 01:19:45.312
Monsieur Gold?
Yeah.

01:19:45.314 --> 01:19:47.248
I'm François Roy's assistant.

01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:49.617
Yeah, give me that.

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:53.988
Am I disturbing you?

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:56.490
Are you disturbing me?

01:19:56.492 --> 01:19:59.226
That's a bit of politesse
that boggles the brain.

01:19:59.228 --> 01:20:01.462
Do you mind if I close
these curtains?

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:03.697
Headache.
Oh. If you wish.

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:07.568
Has Chloé left for school?

01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:10.471
Oh. That's my guess.
I don't know for sure.

01:20:10.473 --> 01:20:12.506
I can't, you know...

01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:15.943
Who can say? You know how
it is with kids today.

01:20:15.945 --> 01:20:20.381
You and my daughter were
awake together last night.

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:23.083
Very precise.

01:20:23.085 --> 01:20:24.685
Usually a mother wants to know,

01:20:24.687 --> 01:20:26.654
"Did you sleep
with my daughter?"

01:20:26.656 --> 01:20:30.090
Which actually describes
a perfectly innocent act.

01:20:30.092 --> 01:20:32.092
But "Were you awake
with my daughter?"

01:20:32.094 --> 01:20:35.930
That's a 64-euro
mother of a question.

01:20:35.932 --> 01:20:39.333
I was awake most of the night
thinking about your mother.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.370
Really? And?

01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:47.041
I was thinking that she didn't
know about me is naive.

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:48.542
She must have known.

01:20:48.544 --> 01:20:51.779
Nothing passes unnoticed
in a marriage, I think.

01:20:51.781 --> 01:20:54.715
No, I think she knew,

01:20:54.717 --> 01:20:58.052
and I think somehow
she approved.

01:20:58.054 --> 01:20:59.954
Approved?

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:03.490
You really believe that?

01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:05.526
She did nothing to stop it.

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:09.363
She was stuck in a marriage with a kid.
She was trapped.

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:14.802
I stayed in my marriage
by choice.

01:21:14.804 --> 01:21:17.905
I was pregnant at the
same time as your mother.

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:20.741
Uh, hold on.

01:21:20.743 --> 01:21:25.646
Is it possible that Max got
two birds with one stone?

01:21:25.648 --> 01:21:29.383
If you know what I mean. No,
I don't know what you mean.

01:21:29.385 --> 01:21:32.820
Did Chloé have her own father?

01:21:32.822 --> 01:21:34.388
Of course.

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:36.390
Of course Chloé
had her own father.

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:38.926
You had your father.
Chloé had her father.

01:21:38.928 --> 01:21:42.763
I think you're an old
French fibber, Mrs. G.

01:21:42.765 --> 01:21:46.233
What went on between your father
and me concerned nobody but us.

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:48.569
We were discreet.
We were cautious.

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:50.938
We were considerate.

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:56.577
I-I don't wish to cloud your
delusions in any way, Mrs. G,

01:21:56.579 --> 01:21:58.746
but what went on
between you and my father...

01:21:58.748 --> 01:22:01.882
concerned me and your
daughter quite significantly.

01:22:01.884 --> 01:22:05.119
You were hardly discreet,
not at all cautious.

01:22:05.121 --> 01:22:09.623
And considerate?
Hmm. Well, uh...

01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:14.628
In view of the 10 to 15 suicide
failures of my mother...

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:16.797
and the ultimate
suicide success,

01:22:16.799 --> 01:22:19.466
I just don't see how the word
"considerate" fits in, exactly.

01:22:19.468 --> 01:22:21.802
Your mother killed herself?

01:22:21.804 --> 01:22:23.504
Y...

01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:26.974
You didn't know?
He didn't tell you?

01:22:26.976 --> 01:22:29.043
No.

01:22:29.045 --> 01:22:31.445
No, I did not know.

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:34.214
I knew she was ill.

01:22:34.216 --> 01:22:38.585
I... That's why
he never came back.

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:41.055
That's so considerate.

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:45.125
Madame G?

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:03.811
Doctor gone?
Gone.

01:23:08.316 --> 01:23:10.417
Is she dead or alive?
She must be alive.

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:13.354
I didn't hear
any hideous screams.

01:23:13.356 --> 01:23:17.057
What are you staring at? Do I
have spinach between my teeth?

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:20.694
I can't have spinach
between my teeth.

01:23:21.696 --> 01:23:23.197
Oh.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.868
It's Châteauneuf-du-Pape
between my teeth.

01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:30.971
Do you want my mother
to outlive you? W...

01:23:30.973 --> 01:23:34.241
Oh, a reference to my drinking.
Mm-hmm.

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:40.714
Yes. I've been drinking
with my little friend here.

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:43.884
He's not...
not very good company.

01:23:43.886 --> 01:23:46.754
He drinks not at all
and he says even less.

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:53.227
A boar... is a bore.

01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:58.699
Speaking of wordplay, I've been
doing a little ink sport myself.

01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:02.336
Um, it's, uh... it's for you.
It's a gift.

01:24:02.338 --> 01:24:06.373
It's a small memoir.

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:11.078
Uh, mostly
my anec-dotage.

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:14.882
But I think you'll be amused and
engaged from cover to cover.

01:24:14.884 --> 01:24:16.750
Should I...

01:24:16.752 --> 01:24:19.586
Please don't, uh... don't read
it while I'm in the room.

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:22.623
It'll be embarrassing,
for both of us.

01:24:25.928 --> 01:24:28.862
Do you mind if I ask you
something personal?

01:24:28.864 --> 01:24:30.764
Of course.

01:24:30.766 --> 01:24:32.266
Uh...

01:24:34.502 --> 01:24:36.837
what's, um...

01:24:36.839 --> 01:24:38.972
what's happening
with your friend?

01:24:40.675 --> 01:24:43.243
My friend? Mmm. Um...

01:24:44.846 --> 01:24:46.947
He has a wife
and two children...

01:24:46.949 --> 01:24:50.684
and a granddaughter
from his first marriage.

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:58.926
I thought that just having
him in my life was...

01:24:58.928 --> 01:25:01.929
was worth it, but I was wrong.

01:25:03.198 --> 01:25:06.100
I was wrong.

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:10.637
He's gone now.
I asked him to go.

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:15.476
What you said to me...

01:25:15.478 --> 01:25:17.878
hurt me, um,

01:25:19.314 --> 01:25:21.348
because it was true.

01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:26.186
I was doing
to those children...

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:30.057
exactly what our parents
did to us.

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:37.131
It's a pity we didn't meet
before we were born.

01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:47.341
What your mother did to you...

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:50.844
was unthinkably cruel,

01:25:52.013 --> 01:25:53.647
unforgivable.

01:25:57.852 --> 01:26:00.954
No. No, you really...
No. We can't.

01:26:00.956 --> 01:26:04.091
If you kiss me,
I'll just drag you down.

01:26:04.093 --> 01:26:06.827
I do that to people.

01:26:06.829 --> 01:26:10.264
Once they kiss me, their
lives change for the worse.

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:16.870
You're so beautiful.

01:26:16.872 --> 01:26:20.240
Mmm. I'm not beautiful.
I'm nearly old.

01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:25.012
No. You're beautiful.

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:32.019
You've been warned.
I know.

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:51.171
<i>My name is Mathias Gold.</i>

01:26:51.173 --> 01:26:54.675
<i>When I used to have friends,</i>
<i>they called me Jim,</i>

01:26:54.677 --> 01:26:57.010
<i>and I would answer.</i>

01:26:57.012 --> 01:27:00.647
<i>I grew up on Park Avenue</i>
<i>in New York City.</i>

01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:02.883
<i>My parents were wealthy.</i>

01:27:02.885 --> 01:27:06.286
<i>I was born with</i>
<i>a silver knife in my back.</i>

01:27:08.923 --> 01:27:11.491
<i>Anytime anyone</i>
<i>follows their heart,</i>

01:27:11.493 --> 01:27:14.595
<i>someone else</i>
<i>gets their heart broken.</i>

01:27:14.597 --> 01:27:16.897
<i>There's always detritus,</i>

01:27:16.899 --> 01:27:19.132
<i>always hurt, always pain.</i>

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:23.403
<i>Love is a limited substance.</i>

01:27:23.405 --> 01:27:25.772
<i>When you give love</i>
<i>to someone new,</i>

01:27:25.774 --> 01:27:28.842
<i>you have to take it away</i>
<i>from someone old.</i>

01:27:29.944 --> 01:27:32.679
<i>My father took every ounce</i>
<i>of love he had...</i>

01:27:32.681 --> 01:27:35.082
<i>and dumped it in Paris.</i>

01:27:36.217 --> 01:27:38.919
<i>People like us think</i>
<i>we've been cursed by God,</i>

01:27:38.921 --> 01:27:43.790
<i>but, in fact, we've been</i>
<i>cursed by our parents.</i>

01:27:43.792 --> 01:27:46.760
<i>You look in the mirror,</i>
<i>and you see an adult.</i>

01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:49.296
<i>But you have to look</i>
<i>more carefully.</i>

01:27:49.298 --> 01:27:51.898
<i>There's a big piece of you</i>
<i>that never grew up.</i>

01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:54.368
<i>It may have grown tall,</i>
<i>but not up.</i>

01:27:54.370 --> 01:27:56.803
<i>You spend your life</i>
<i>waiting for your parents...</i>

01:27:56.805 --> 01:27:58.972
<i>to come back</i>
<i>and make it all right.</i>

01:27:58.974 --> 01:28:01.141
<i>But they don't come back.</i>

01:28:01.143 --> 01:28:03.143
<i>It's not all right.</i>

01:28:04.212 --> 01:28:06.446
<i>You have to somehow</i>
<i>move past them.</i>

01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:10.484
<i>You have to somehow convince yourself
that you don't need those people.</i>

01:28:10.486 --> 01:28:12.519
<i>Because you don't.</i>

01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:25.499
Couldn't you sleep?

01:28:25.501 --> 01:28:28.101
No.
Nor could I.

01:28:28.103 --> 01:28:30.470
I called to you in the night.

01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:33.974
Why?
I wanted to talk to you.

01:28:33.976 --> 01:28:37.678
Why? Oh, I've lived
too long, Chloé.

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:40.013
I've only the dead to talk to.

01:28:40.015 --> 01:28:42.949
Everyone I've ever loved is gone.
How can you s-say that?

01:28:42.951 --> 01:28:45.152
Oh, you know I didn't mean you.

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:51.291
I know that I...

01:28:51.293 --> 01:28:54.961
spent my entire childhood
in this house without love.

01:28:54.963 --> 01:28:57.798
You had a loving mother
and a loving father.

01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.966
How can you say that?

01:28:59.968 --> 01:29:02.703
I know that watching
Mathias sleeping...

01:29:02.705 --> 01:29:04.971
I could see his father's face,

01:29:04.973 --> 01:29:08.141
and some part of me
wanted him dead.

01:29:08.143 --> 01:29:10.177
- You can't mean that.
- Why not?

01:29:10.179 --> 01:29:12.646
Why can't I mean that?
Why can't I mean that?

01:29:12.648 --> 01:29:15.382
Because he's a person
who is so sad.

01:29:15.384 --> 01:29:17.784
Oh. So sad.

01:29:17.786 --> 01:29:20.387
And defeated.

01:29:20.389 --> 01:29:22.889
Like me.

01:29:22.891 --> 01:29:26.727
I would never say that. You'd never
say that because you never see it!

01:29:26.729 --> 01:29:29.463
Oh, how could a child
of yours be unhappy?

01:29:29.465 --> 01:29:31.398
Oh, that would be unthinkable!

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.900
You're not a child anymore, Chloé.
I'm your child!

01:29:33.902 --> 01:29:36.069
- Years and years ago!
- What does that mean?

01:29:36.071 --> 01:29:38.672
It means that when you were 15,
you stopped being my child...

01:29:38.674 --> 01:29:40.907
and started being my daughter.

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:46.380
I have spent my whole life
at your side.

01:29:46.382 --> 01:29:50.650
- I have never left you.
- I never asked for that!

01:29:51.919 --> 01:29:54.654
Look, it seems I've caused
nothing but unhappiness...

01:29:54.656 --> 01:29:57.591
in your life,
and in Mathias's life.

01:29:57.593 --> 01:30:00.327
So, what should I have done?

01:30:00.329 --> 01:30:03.196
We know what
I should not have done.

01:30:03.198 --> 01:30:04.998
I should not
have followed my heart.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
I should not have stayed
with your father...

01:30:07.002 --> 01:30:09.035
and made a home
for my daughter.

01:30:09.037 --> 01:30:11.438
All these things were wrong.

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.874
I'm 92. I've made nothing
but mistakes.

01:30:13.876 --> 01:30:15.776
So, you tell me.
You tell me, Chloé.

01:30:15.778 --> 01:30:20.080
What? You know so much. You tell
me what I should have done.

01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:25.652
Is Mathias's father my father?

01:30:27.855 --> 01:30:29.856
There's so much about him
that's like me.

01:30:29.858 --> 01:30:32.426
Just...
Just tell me the truth.

01:30:32.428 --> 01:30:36.663
Is Mathias my brother?

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:42.402
I don't know.

01:30:42.404 --> 01:30:45.539
I have never known.

01:30:45.541 --> 01:30:49.876
What possible difference could it
have made knowing or not knowing?

01:30:49.878 --> 01:30:51.812
Your father brought you up.
He loved you.

01:30:51.814 --> 01:30:54.014
You were his daughter.

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:02.055
Oh, Chloé.

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:05.392
Chloé.

01:32:00.848 --> 01:32:03.216
Oh.

01:32:04.652 --> 01:32:07.487
Chloé?

01:32:08.991 --> 01:32:10.624
Oh, Chloé.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:15.829
You're the reason he hated me!

01:32:15.831 --> 01:32:17.831
- Mathias?
- No!

01:32:17.833 --> 01:32:20.500
My father, your husband!

01:32:20.502 --> 01:32:23.370
He didn't hate you.

01:32:23.372 --> 01:32:26.039
You were his daughter.
He loved you.

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:28.642
There was no love!
No love!

01:32:31.512 --> 01:32:34.381
Perhaps that's why Mathias
and I detested each other.

01:32:34.383 --> 01:32:39.052
Because somewhere deep inside,
we both knew the truth.

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:46.059
Why didn't you
tell him the truth?

01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:49.563
There is no other truth.

01:32:49.565 --> 01:32:52.732
Do you know where I slept
last night, Mother?

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:59.072
I don't think the world will
come to an end because of that.

01:32:59.074 --> 01:33:04.110
I see nothing catastrophic in the
two of you comforting each other.

01:33:04.112 --> 01:33:07.347
No virtue in two of you
being lonely.

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:11.184
That's sweet.

01:33:11.186 --> 01:33:13.219
Insane, but sweet.

01:33:13.221 --> 01:33:16.456
Well, you're certainly not going
to have children at your age.

01:33:16.458 --> 01:33:18.091
Oh! No.

01:33:18.093 --> 01:33:19.693
You're certainly right, Mother.

01:33:19.695 --> 01:33:23.797
I certainly can't have
children at my age.

01:33:23.799 --> 01:33:26.633
It certainly stops with us.

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:34.808
People like Mathias and me...

01:33:34.810 --> 01:33:38.311
we keep telling ourselves
that none of this matters,

01:33:38.313 --> 01:33:42.782
that childhood is just,
um, a human invention.

01:33:42.784 --> 01:33:45.819
It's not God's invention.

01:33:45.821 --> 01:33:48.488
There's nothing natural
about it...

01:33:48.490 --> 01:33:50.890
and we should
just let it all go.

01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:54.127
But we can't...

01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:56.863
because...

01:33:58.466 --> 01:34:02.469
our pain tells us
that we're cursed...

01:34:02.471 --> 01:34:05.338
and so we go through life
thinking...

01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:07.474
Oh, my God!

01:34:08.342 --> 01:34:09.809
Oh!

01:34:16.018 --> 01:34:18.018
I shot the pig.

01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:20.854
You shot the pig?
I shot the pig!

01:34:20.856 --> 01:34:24.257
You shot the pig.
He shot the pig!

01:34:24.259 --> 01:34:27.293
He shot the pig?
What pig?

01:34:27.295 --> 01:34:29.929
One of us had to go.
It was him or me.

01:34:29.931 --> 01:34:35.368
Listen. Last night, after
we stayed awake together...

01:34:35.370 --> 01:34:37.871
and our souls clapped
their hands and sang,

01:34:37.873 --> 01:34:39.506
we made a clean breast of it,

01:34:39.508 --> 01:34:41.374
I was thinking
about you saying...

01:34:41.376 --> 01:34:44.144
"I'm not beautiful.
I'm nearly old."

01:34:44.146 --> 01:34:46.046
And I wished
I had a better answer.

01:34:46.048 --> 01:34:49.149
And I think I've thought of one,
so would you mind saying it again?

01:34:49.151 --> 01:34:51.051
What are you asking me?

01:34:51.053 --> 01:34:54.120
What you said yesterday when you said,
"I'm not beautiful. I'm nearly old."

01:34:54.122 --> 01:34:56.242
Just could you
say it again? Please?

01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:59.292
I'm not beautiful.
I'm nearly old?

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:03.963
A perfect flower is nearly old.

01:35:06.033 --> 01:35:08.868
It's good, isn't it?

01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:11.037
No. You hate it.

01:35:11.039 --> 01:35:15.075
No. It's over the top,
but I like it.

01:35:15.077 --> 01:35:16.943
I like it too.

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:23.216
Oh. Talk to me, Mrs. G.

01:35:23.218 --> 01:35:26.720
Well, I don't know what to say.

01:35:26.722 --> 01:35:30.757
Well, try saying,
"I'm sorry I lied."

01:35:30.759 --> 01:35:33.426
Well, I am sorry I lied.

01:35:34.495 --> 01:35:37.230
And I forgive you
for selling my chairs.

01:35:39.033 --> 01:35:41.267
Please, Mathias.

01:35:41.269 --> 01:35:44.938
Don't leave.
Please stay.

01:35:47.608 --> 01:35:49.275
I don't know.

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:22.475
Negative.
Not family.

01:36:22.477 --> 01:36:26.012
Not family?
Not at all.

01:36:34.655 --> 01:36:37.023
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

01:36:45.266 --> 01:36:47.834
Hey! Monsieur Gold.

01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:51.271
Lefebvre!

01:36:51.273 --> 01:36:54.007
Would you like a glass of wine?

01:36:54.009 --> 01:36:55.909
You live on this thing?

01:36:55.911 --> 01:36:58.011
Yes, yes. I do.

01:36:58.013 --> 01:37:00.180
It's like an old barge.

01:37:00.182 --> 01:37:01.681
Exactly.

01:37:01.683 --> 01:37:04.350
Oh! The blood of Paris!
I get it.

01:37:04.352 --> 01:37:07.654
Right. Come, come!
I'll show you.

01:37:07.656 --> 01:37:09.522
Whoa. Watch out.

01:37:09.524 --> 01:37:11.257
Got it.

01:37:11.259 --> 01:37:13.493
<i>Merci.</i>

01:37:13.495 --> 01:37:15.461
That's my place.
Wow.

01:37:15.463 --> 01:37:17.430
My yard. My garden.

01:37:17.432 --> 01:37:20.066
Come.
I show you inside.

01:37:24.438 --> 01:37:27.841
Pretty cool.
Really nice.

01:37:27.843 --> 01:37:30.143
Yeah. I...

01:37:30.145 --> 01:37:32.445
I love it. Yeah.

01:37:32.447 --> 01:37:36.049
I bought it as a <i> viager</i>
many, many years ago.

01:37:36.051 --> 01:37:38.685
Oh. And the person died?

01:37:38.687 --> 01:37:42.188
Six days after we signed
the contract.

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:44.791
Oh. You're kidding?

01:37:44.793 --> 01:37:46.559
I was lucky.

01:37:47.628 --> 01:37:49.729
It's a crazy system
you've got here.

01:37:49.731 --> 01:37:53.433
Betting like that
on people dying.

01:37:54.034 --> 01:37:56.169
It's a game of destiny.

01:37:56.171 --> 01:38:00.039
If the person dies quickly, it's
your destiny to replace them.

01:38:00.041 --> 01:38:02.342
And if they don't die quickly?

01:38:02.344 --> 01:38:05.912
Then it's your destiny
to pay to help them live.

01:38:10.517 --> 01:38:12.652
Hmm.

01:40:01.128 --> 01:40:02.795
I-Is Chloé here?

01:40:02.797 --> 01:40:06.632
Oh, no.
She'll be here soon.

01:40:06.634 --> 01:40:08.701
I'm going to stay.

01:40:08.703 --> 01:40:11.704
But don't tell Chloé.
I want to tell her myself.

01:40:11.706 --> 01:40:15.208
Oh, I'm... I'm so pleased.

01:40:15.210 --> 01:40:18.344
You need never worry
about money.

01:40:18.346 --> 01:40:24.384
You'll soon be able to sell
this apartment as a <i> viager.</i>

01:40:24.386 --> 01:40:29.022
You won't get full value because
you're both still quite young,

01:40:29.024 --> 01:40:33.626
but you'll always have
a roof over your heads.

01:40:36.397 --> 01:40:39.632
Phew.
Oh, Mathias?

01:40:41.568 --> 01:40:44.003
This is yours.

01:40:44.005 --> 01:40:47.607
I gave it to your father,
but he wanted you to have it.

01:40:51.512 --> 01:40:54.147
Thank you.

01:40:58.085 --> 01:41:00.205
Where are my father's ashes?

01:41:18.939 --> 01:41:22.108
You did a good thing
sending me here, Max.

01:41:22.110 --> 01:41:23.776
Thank you.

01:41:31.285 --> 01:41:35.822
On a scale of one to a 100, you've
just gone from a one to a three.

01:43:18.058 --> 01:43:19.559
Wow.

01:43:19.561 --> 01:43:22.528
I have the check.

01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:24.630
Um, we're not selling.

01:43:28.302 --> 01:43:30.970
I'm sorry?
It's a family thing.

01:43:32.239 --> 01:43:33.906
You understand.

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:13.092
Wh-Where did you
study English?

01:47:13.094 --> 01:47:16.362
Ah, I never studied English.

01:47:16.364 --> 01:47:20.466
I learned it from
watching American movies.

01:47:20.468 --> 01:47:24.203
"Frankly, my dear,
I don't give you a damn."

01:47:25.205 --> 01:47:28.407
Oh. Yeah. Clark Gable. Right.

01:47:28.409 --> 01:47:30.009
I'd know that anywhere.
