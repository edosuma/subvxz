WEBVTT

00:04.922 --> 00:07.335
I do this for a good friend.

00:07.424 --> 00:12.670
And I hope you will agree
that there is no more holy thing

00:12.763 --> 00:15.847
in this world
than a friend in need.

00:16.850 --> 00:21.015
In my case, it is the estimable
Lady Jane Franklin

00:21.104 --> 00:22.686
who wishes to address you...

00:23.315 --> 00:25.932
...under rather
urgent circumstances.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.862
Thank you, Mr. Dickens.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.784
Many of you will have
become aware, no doubt,

00:36.870 --> 00:40.454
of the mystery
beginning to surround

00:40.541 --> 00:43.033
my husband's expedition
to the Arctic.

00:43.126 --> 00:46.210
The Admiralty are doing
what they can.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.460
But the urgency to find
my husband and his men,

00:49.550 --> 00:54.090
and the enormity
of that icy province

00:54.179 --> 00:56.216
in which they are lost...

00:56.306 --> 00:58.764
leads me here to you.

00:58.850 --> 01:02.969
Now, I know that many of you
are very generous patrons

01:03.063 --> 01:05.271
of charities and of the arts.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.520
I wonder
if you might be induced

01:08.610 --> 01:12.194
to subscribe next,
not to another cultural society...

01:13.574 --> 01:15.816
...but to a smart little ship.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.994
A ketch. Outfitted to venture
to that very same land

01:20.080 --> 01:23.869
into which my husband and more
than a hundred other good men

01:23.959 --> 01:26.042
have bravely sailed...

01:26.753 --> 01:28.790
...and vanished.

01:30.090 --> 01:34.460
I feel it is certain that
Sir John and his lost heroes

01:34.553 --> 01:40.470
will be found, and soon,
by our intrepid rescue mission.

01:41.435 --> 01:45.645
Now, which of you good people
would like to see

01:45.731 --> 01:50.146
your name published
among its patrons?

02:03.206 --> 02:06.540
I was going to start
pulling him by his feet.

02:07.336 --> 02:09.544
Why don't I give you a hand?

02:09.630 --> 02:12.247
I was... I was trying
to recognize if I knew him.

02:12.341 --> 02:16.802
Is this...?
Is this friend or...? Or...?

02:16.887 --> 02:18.423
Hey.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.969
That won't change
what we do for him.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.556
It's Mr. Honey, the carpenter.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.857
I recognize his neckerchief.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.150
- You all right, lad?
- Yes, sir.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.986
Francis, we can't possibly
bury them all.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.198
We've 32 dead
as well as 23 unaccounted for.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.533
Lieutenant Hodgson included.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.584
We're glassing every horizon.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.004
It may be that one or two
who ran out in the fog

02:53.090 --> 02:56.504
will still find their way back
to us like your ship's boy did.

02:58.804 --> 03:01.217
We've no sign of Dr. Goodsir?

03:01.306 --> 03:04.390
He'd never have gone off with
those men of his own volition.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.109
Do you imagine that this man
may return to us, Mr. Bridgens?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.687
If Private Heather remained
a mystery to the doctors,

03:17.781 --> 03:19.864
I have no hope of solving this.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.906
What explains this...
this similar state...

03:24.913 --> 03:27.781
when their injuries
could not be more different?

03:27.874 --> 03:31.117
All I can bring to mind
is the example of a diary...

03:31.211 --> 03:33.203
with all the entries removed.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.379
It's still a book, yes.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.124
But...

03:39.428 --> 03:41.169
blank pages now.

03:58.029 --> 04:01.693
We set sail from Greenhithe
three years ago...

04:01.783 --> 04:04.241
with 133 men aboard.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.661
Who could have imagined
such grief would come to us?

04:08.874 --> 04:11.867
We've no choice now but
to carry it with us as we go.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.079
To bring home
the names of our dead.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.753
So that their loved ones
can find solace

04:19.843 --> 04:22.756
knowing that... friendship...

04:24.097 --> 04:27.261
...and courage were with them
till the very end.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.603
So take up the word with me,
men.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.359
- South!
- South!

04:39.237 --> 04:41.445
We march south.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.272
Prepare for departure, men.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.982
Burn our dead, Thomas.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.739
Let them be warm as they go.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.697
And the supplies
we cannot carry?

04:51.875 --> 04:54.788
If Hickey's band are waiting
us out to loot the camp?

04:57.130 --> 04:59.873
Some of the men with him
made their choice out of fear.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.834
I'll not take away any chance
they have to survive.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.299
We may meet them yet again.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.598
And if we do, I want them
to make a different choice.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.351
Leave our supplies
in a tidy pile.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.816
As an offering.

05:19.444 --> 05:22.983
I want the men with Hickey
to know that's how we meant it.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.039
More than God loves them.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.792
And pull!

07:09.721 --> 07:11.212
Men!

07:14.851 --> 07:16.763
Men!

07:16.853 --> 07:18.936
Men! Here!

07:32.077 --> 07:34.364
Lieutenant,
what a miracle!

07:42.671 --> 07:44.754
Drink. Drink up.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.300
Ah.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.837
The others?

07:52.931 --> 07:54.672
What's become of them?

07:54.766 --> 07:56.849
They've moved on.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.230
Have you hunted anything?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.568
There's no game here.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.613
But we have food.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.036
You...

08:18.123 --> 08:19.864
have things in hand, then?

08:22.127 --> 08:24.210
There's still a place
for you here.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.588
If you want it.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.878
One, two, three, heave!

09:21.728 --> 09:23.936
One, two, three, heave!

09:28.485 --> 09:29.896
Heave!

09:32.322 --> 09:33.984
Stop, lads!

09:37.952 --> 09:40.444
It's the heat that I can't...
I can't stand.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.758
Whoa!

09:58.348 --> 10:00.010
All right?

10:04.312 --> 10:06.269
Are you comfortable, James?

10:08.108 --> 10:10.145
I'm sorry.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.601
What in heaven for?

10:11.694 --> 10:14.061
How you were walking at all
will puzzle me

10:14.155 --> 10:16.613
the rest of my days.
You've got holes in you, James.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.362
That shot was fired
six years ago.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.537
It's going to murder me yet.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.412
But if it doesn't, it's going
to make that Chinese sniper story

10:27.502 --> 10:30.290
you're so fond of recounting
a half hour longer to tell.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.757
Mr. Bridgens has dressed
your wounds.

10:37.053 --> 10:40.012
He thinks he can make up
a plaster tonight...

10:40.098 --> 10:43.717
that'll keep them shut till
we can get them healing again.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.473
Hm. There's time.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.021
There's time.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.613
I know your thoughts,
Lieutenant.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.656
I was thinking...

11:03.746 --> 11:05.829
about a wedding I attended...

11:06.624 --> 11:09.241
in which they served
an American ham, from Virginia.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.418
I've never tasted better.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.589
Then I was half right.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.052
What did you imagine
me thinking?

11:23.183 --> 11:26.301
We've eaten from
these tins of mystery

11:26.394 --> 11:28.181
for years now, haven't we?

11:28.271 --> 11:30.763
Without ever really knowing
what was in 'em.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.525
Veal cutlets, tomato.

11:35.987 --> 11:39.196
Hm. What could that be?

11:39.282 --> 11:41.365
Really?

11:43.453 --> 11:45.945
Pieces of horse?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.122
A street dog?

11:50.543 --> 11:52.535
Does it matter now?

11:53.338 --> 11:54.670
No.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.966
All that matter is
we were willing to eat it

11:59.052 --> 12:01.135
and it served our needs.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.805
Is that about right?

12:14.692 --> 12:17.730
But our needs
have changed, Lieutenant.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.654
We need to ask ourselves...

12:22.367 --> 12:24.450
what are we willing
to eat next?

12:41.511 --> 12:43.753
I only hauled part of the day.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.759
My knees feel like
they've got glass in them.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.383
It'll get worse, this.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.598
How?

12:54.190 --> 12:56.273
For what should I prepare?

12:57.026 --> 12:59.109
To die, Mr. Gibson.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.612
Because all your joints
will soon feel

13:02.699 --> 13:05.191
as if they are full of glass.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.368
Elbows, neck.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.954
Your knuckles.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.202
The little joints in your toes.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.330
Oh, and your hips.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.787
I expect that will stop you
from sleeping

13:17.880 --> 13:19.963
from the moment it begins.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.819
Are you not well, Billy?

13:45.366 --> 13:47.653
It's in my knees a bit.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.166
Can he still haul tomorrow?

13:57.086 --> 13:58.702
I'd be very surprised.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.508
I can... I can...

14:05.178 --> 14:07.511
Hey, be calm, Billy.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.681
- Be calm.
- Hm-mm.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.846
Hm-mm.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.178
We'll make the best
of a bad situation.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.898
Like we always have.

14:39.754 --> 14:42.337
I wouldn't either, Doctor.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.460
What's that, Mr. Gibson?

14:44.550 --> 14:46.416
Comfort us.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.047
Any of us.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.594
We're...

15:33.766 --> 15:35.348
Sir!

15:36.060 --> 15:38.598
The sweep party
has come in with a sighting.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.271
If Hickey's group's split,
they'll be trying to flank us.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.440
No, sir. It's the creature.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.735
They said they saw it lurching
around off to the west,

15:46.821 --> 15:48.858
down along the wrack.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.032
It came in then headed back
to the ice and disappeared.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.819
It didn't seem to detect us.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.778
Lurching, you say?

15:57.457 --> 15:59.369
Wounded, perhaps?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.917
It's been injured twice now.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.971
All this jostling around
is beginning to hurt him, sir.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.139
Camp here!

16:17.602 --> 16:20.140
We're fully through
with the salt meats now.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.847
What we have left,
beyond the tins,

16:23.941 --> 16:26.308
amounts mostly to biscuits...

16:26.402 --> 16:28.439
tea and chocolates.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.659
Sir...

16:36.454 --> 16:38.366
our pace has slowed...

16:39.415 --> 16:41.657
hauling some of the ill
in the boats.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.870
If we can extend
this temporary camp for...

16:46.923 --> 16:49.006
for more than a few days then...

16:51.594 --> 16:53.677
we can allow the ill
to rest here...

16:56.849 --> 16:58.966
while the bulk of us
proceed south.

17:02.813 --> 17:05.180
We can hopefully
find game and...

17:05.900 --> 17:07.482
and trek back for the others

17:07.568 --> 17:09.981
once we have
something more to offer them.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.482
We send out
hunting parties every day.

17:16.368 --> 17:20.613
What you're suggesting
would be a death sentence...

17:20.705 --> 17:22.789
for those men.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.338
Some, surely.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.918
But not for all of us.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.636
As you said yourself, Captain,

17:39.725 --> 17:41.808
our journey is still
a long one.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.600
The men know how tired
they are.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.725
And they know why.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.271
It's a reasonable logic...

17:54.365 --> 17:58.655
and I don't fault anyone
for... following it.

18:01.289 --> 18:03.872
But I am going to make myself
perfectly clear.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.159
That is not our way.

18:08.921 --> 18:13.461
If we are to deposit anything
with a view to return...

18:14.302 --> 18:16.385
at some later date...

18:17.388 --> 18:20.472
they will be things...
not men.

18:24.353 --> 18:28.939
I'd rather we leave our tents
behind and sleep two to a sack,

18:29.025 --> 18:31.438
like the orphans we are,

18:31.527 --> 18:34.770
than leave one man alone
with last burdens.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.034
And I speak not only of James.

18:41.871 --> 18:45.581
I'll not leave any one of you
alone either.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.913
The hartshorn and camphor
is having very little effect, sir.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.839
I'm... I'm not Christ.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.180
My... My body...

20:32.982 --> 20:34.518
use it.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.565
Feed the men.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.692
Francis...

20:45.661 --> 20:47.994
God wants you to live.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.493
He wants you to live.

20:57.965 --> 21:01.254
The muscles are in spasm, sir.
They've gone rigid.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.675
Francis...

21:05.765 --> 21:08.007
Help me. Help me.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.144
Help me out of it.

21:15.566 --> 21:18.024
Are you certain... James?

21:18.110 --> 21:20.193
Hm? Are you certain?

21:32.082 --> 21:33.493
Leave us, Mr. Bridgens.

21:34.502 --> 21:35.913
Sir...

21:37.713 --> 21:39.796
if I may.

21:39.882 --> 21:41.874
Use this.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.004
His reflexes
will try to spit it out.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.086
You'll have to help it down.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.093
Like this.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.061
It was an honor
serving you, sir.

21:56.273 --> 21:59.232
You're a good man.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.817
There will be poems.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.573
Do you wish to speak, sir?

23:31.869 --> 23:33.952
I said a service with him
last night.

23:34.038 --> 23:35.620
Just the two of us.

23:37.207 --> 23:39.540
Let the others pray over him
if they like.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.627
Then hide him in the landscape,
Edward.

23:43.714 --> 23:45.797
Make him invisible.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.302
I don't want him found
and pawed.

23:53.349 --> 23:54.590
Yes, sir.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.424
If we'd had our wits about us,

23:56.518 --> 23:58.350
Chambers and I
would have taken a shot.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.600
How far out from camp was this?

24:01.690 --> 24:03.431
Not more than a mile now, sir.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.609
West of us again.
We were down wind.

24:07.363 --> 24:10.106
He's tracking us. Or trying to.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.532
Lieutenant Little,
gather the men.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.656
- We'll discuss the strategy.
- Sir.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.543
We need higher ground.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.997
Put all the sick
in the middle and...

24:27.091 --> 24:29.504
face it down with
all the ammo we've got.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.385
I've got a strategy, Francis.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.337
You cut inland a bit...

24:34.431 --> 24:36.297
and I drive it back out
onto the ice.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.429
- Not possible.
- Yeah, it is.

24:38.519 --> 24:40.636
I smell like
a thousand-year-old armpit.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.812
I mean permission not granted!

24:44.024 --> 24:47.188
I'm not saying goodbye
to two friends in one day.

24:49.780 --> 24:53.194
Between me and you,
Francis, I'm done for.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.616
If you need to ride
in a damn boat,

24:55.703 --> 24:57.945
I'll put you there myself!

25:07.965 --> 25:09.547
Mr. Weeks can make another one.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.969
They're going to have to cut it
a lot higher this time.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.137
And that's only
for the time being.

25:16.932 --> 25:20.096
Best not make me or Mr. Bridgens
go through that, shall we?

25:20.185 --> 25:22.393
Bleeding hell, Thomas.
Why didn't you speak up?

25:22.479 --> 25:25.017
I kept it tidy. No one could
have done a better job.

25:25.107 --> 25:27.645
Jesus Christ!

25:28.610 --> 25:30.693
God!

25:30.779 --> 25:33.567
Francis, we both know
what's coming for me now!

25:33.657 --> 25:35.740
At least love me enough
to admit it.

25:57.473 --> 25:59.055
What do you need?

26:00.017 --> 26:02.054
I've got half a pouch...

26:02.144 --> 26:03.680
for my last smoke.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.433
That'll do for me.

26:07.608 --> 26:10.021
But I'll take some forks
off you and the men.

26:10.110 --> 26:13.103
- 40 or 50.
- Forks?

26:13.197 --> 26:15.234
Aye, and a piece of rope.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.236
Enough to go round me
a few times.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.739
- F...?
- 15 feet should do it.

26:23.707 --> 26:26.165
You're mad.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.950
Come on, lads, push it!

27:30.440 --> 27:31.976
Man down!

27:45.581 --> 27:47.493
Henry. Henry.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.043
John.

27:57.593 --> 27:59.550
Can I sleep?

28:00.596 --> 28:02.053
Yes.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.172
Yes.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.385
Help me get him up.

28:09.479 --> 28:12.062
Hold on, Henry.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.406
No. No.

28:55.359 --> 28:57.942
Can someone...
tell me, please...

28:59.696 --> 29:01.858
if they also see that bird?

29:18.840 --> 29:21.503
They've made camp again.
About six miles away.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.300
There was a friendly face
among them.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.595
They're pitching
all their tents now.

29:26.807 --> 29:28.890
They must plan
to be there a while.

29:31.311 --> 29:33.769
Make our camp here, then.

29:37.985 --> 29:39.977
In the bosom of this hill.

30:01.758 --> 30:03.841
Stay here, Sergeant.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.342
Mr. Goodsir.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.552
I'll not do this.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.602
It's why you were brought.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.815
You're an anatomist.

30:21.403 --> 30:25.693
You've cut up more bodies than
you can probably now remember.

30:25.782 --> 30:29.617
20. I've performed on 20.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.033
Why?

30:34.666 --> 30:37.249
And don't say,
"For my education."

30:38.211 --> 30:41.545
You did so for
the greater benefit of others.

30:42.424 --> 30:44.381
For the sick.

30:45.469 --> 30:47.381
For the dying.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.464
In hopes of helping them.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.517
That is exactly
where we are now.

30:56.188 --> 31:00.774
You've murdered this man...
whom you now wish to eat,

31:00.859 --> 31:03.522
and you're unwilling to butcher
his flesh yourself.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.319
But you will have to.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.527
We do not know which parts...

31:08.617 --> 31:10.700
Yes, you do. Of course you do.

31:12.454 --> 31:16.698
If... If I'm reading right
your accent, Mr. Hickey,

31:17.959 --> 31:20.042
you grew up in a home
where you'd have to use

31:20.128 --> 31:23.587
every part of any meat or fowl
your mam could procure.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.799
So if you want to eat
your friend...

31:28.345 --> 31:31.088
you're going to have
to cut into him yourself.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.476
Do not ask me again.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.815
I am now deciding...

31:43.527 --> 31:45.610
which parts
of Lieutenant Hodgson...

31:47.614 --> 31:50.322
I will cut into first...

31:52.244 --> 31:56.284
for every hour you refuse
to apply yourself to this.

31:57.040 --> 32:00.078
You will stand apart no longer.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.085
I'll give you some advice.

32:12.472 --> 32:17.137
Don't indulge your morals
over your practicals.

32:18.812 --> 32:20.394
Not now.

32:25.986 --> 32:28.069
Don't you also want to live?

32:39.332 --> 32:41.324
Sit with it an hour...

32:42.169 --> 32:46.129
and then...
we'll consider your choice made.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.815
I'm not troubling any of you.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.368
- Stand up, Lieutenant!
- You'll break my hand that way!

33:17.454 --> 33:19.537
Let him be! Let him be!

33:24.211 --> 33:26.294
Give me 40 minutes!

36:59.634 --> 37:01.671
Mr. Goodsir!

37:01.761 --> 37:03.423
Come out!

37:30.123 --> 37:32.206
Dr. Goodsir?

37:41.301 --> 37:43.634
Dr. Goodsir.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.738
One summer...

38:06.034 --> 38:08.026
when I was seven...

38:08.828 --> 38:11.286
my parents sent me
to live with two aunts...

38:13.041 --> 38:15.124
in Oxfordshire.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.919
I did not want to go.

38:19.881 --> 38:22.749
The elderly have that effect
on children.

38:27.055 --> 38:29.138
But they loved me...

38:30.058 --> 38:33.301
and I... grew to love them.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.472
They were... Papists.

38:39.359 --> 38:41.692
I came to find, devout.

38:43.905 --> 38:47.819
Each Sunday, they would
leave me with a housemaid...

38:49.118 --> 38:51.201
while they attended
a Catholic Mass.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.372
I was frightened for them.

38:57.418 --> 39:03.335
I'd been told they were doing
some great unforgivable thing.

39:05.218 --> 39:08.962
Then, one morning,
they took me with them.

39:09.931 --> 39:11.923
I was shaking.

39:13.935 --> 39:16.018
The service was not the...

39:16.688 --> 39:20.648
howling spectacle of sin
I'd imagined, but...

39:21.985 --> 39:24.068
It was beautiful.

39:26.281 --> 39:31.743
The singing... sounded
delivered by angels themselves.

39:36.499 --> 39:39.116
When it came time
for the Eucharist, I...

39:40.295 --> 39:42.503
found myself moved
to step forward.

39:43.673 --> 39:47.087
My aunts were surprised,
but pleased, I could see.

39:52.974 --> 39:55.057
I took the wafer
on my tongue...

39:56.603 --> 39:58.686
drank from the chalice.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.814
I felt clean.

40:07.530 --> 40:12.400
With the body and blood
of Christ within me...

40:13.536 --> 40:19.908
I felt forgiven
of every poor, weak...

40:20.001 --> 40:22.084
or selfish thing
within my soul.

40:27.175 --> 40:29.792
It was a perfect moment...

40:29.886 --> 40:34.051
in a whole... imperfect life.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.308
The next week...

40:43.524 --> 40:45.937
when it came time
to dress, I...

40:47.236 --> 40:49.273
I pretended to be ill.

40:51.866 --> 40:53.858
They knew I was pretending.

40:54.869 --> 40:57.111
To this day,
I don't know why I did it.

41:00.333 --> 41:02.541
They never asked me
to join them again.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.045
We never spoke of it.

41:07.966 --> 41:11.459
It was the last, and only, time

41:11.552 --> 41:13.635
I stepped into a Papist church.

41:17.266 --> 41:18.973
But, tonight...

41:20.311 --> 41:22.223
when I close my eyes...

41:23.356 --> 41:25.348
I'm there.

41:30.530 --> 41:32.613
If I were a braver man...

41:35.201 --> 41:39.195
I'd kill Mr. Hickey, though
it would mean my death too.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.824
But I'm hungry.

41:45.253 --> 41:47.996
I'm hungry, and I want to live.

42:29.630 --> 42:31.713
Where?

42:32.925 --> 42:35.759
It's got Crozier's group
a very scant few miles ahead of here.

42:35.845 --> 42:37.882
And ours
a very few miles behind.

42:37.972 --> 42:40.635
It'll find one of us or the other.
I have no doubt about it.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.554
Can we bait it?
In their direction.

42:46.314 --> 42:48.931
We should return to the ships.
I've seen the charts, Cornelius.

42:49.025 --> 42:51.108
We're barely
a quarter of the way.

42:51.819 --> 42:54.562
We've seen more signs of melt.
Mr. Des Voeux sighted birds.

42:54.655 --> 42:56.191
If we head back immediately,
we can be assured

42:56.282 --> 42:57.989
of getting back
to <i>Terror</i> and <i>Erebus</i>

42:58.076 --> 43:00.193
before they have enough
open water to leave.

43:00.286 --> 43:02.369
We can keep a loyal crew.

43:03.081 --> 43:06.290
We can head away from this
place, away from this devil.

43:08.586 --> 43:11.499
Well, you finally sound
frightened, Solomon.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.421
We don't want to meet
this thing again.

43:13.508 --> 43:15.670
We can't beat it.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.252
That's a queer melody
for a Marine.

43:22.558 --> 43:25.426
I saw that thing
murder Mr. Collins.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.512
You've told me.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.312
I didn't tell you all.

43:29.398 --> 43:31.515
I haven't told anyone all.

43:35.905 --> 43:37.988
Do you believe a man
has a soul?

43:42.703 --> 43:44.194
How have you come
to that belief?

43:44.288 --> 43:45.870
Have you seen one?

43:50.169 --> 43:52.161
I have.

43:55.550 --> 43:57.633
I saw Mr. Collins's soul.

44:01.305 --> 44:03.342
I know that's what it was.

44:03.432 --> 44:05.515
And I watched that creature...

44:09.939 --> 44:12.022
ingest it.

44:14.360 --> 44:16.443
Feed on it.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.902
Watched it happen from...

44:20.992 --> 44:23.109
a few yards away.
I'm not mistaken.

44:28.791 --> 44:31.659
It breathed that man's soul in.

44:35.464 --> 44:37.501
Oh!

44:39.343 --> 44:41.300
If it's following
the Captain's group now,

44:41.387 --> 44:43.629
let's take that opportunity
and get as many miles

44:43.723 --> 44:45.510
between us as we can.

44:45.600 --> 44:49.184
Get back to the ships and
be there when the leads open.

44:49.270 --> 44:52.513
Not here. Not here.

44:55.109 --> 44:57.101
This does mean a new plan.

45:01.616 --> 45:04.108
Can you signal
to our friend ahead?

45:07.205 --> 45:08.537
Yes.

45:16.047 --> 45:18.334
<i>The C the C,</i>

45:18.424 --> 45:20.507
<i>the open C.</i>

45:20.593 --> 45:23.427
<i>It grew so fresh.
The ever free.</i>

45:24.680 --> 45:27.639
<i>The ever free. The ever free.</i>

45:29.185 --> 45:30.596
<i>Without it...</i>

45:31.312 --> 45:33.304
<i>Without it...</i>

45:33.397 --> 45:35.764
<i>Guard it
or run to the Earth...</i>

45:35.858 --> 45:37.941
<i>above the regions round.</i>

45:39.862 --> 45:41.444
<i>I love the C.</i>

45:42.949 --> 45:44.941
<i>I love the C.</i>

46:21.028 --> 46:23.111
Mr. Bridgens.

46:44.385 --> 46:47.253
He's been
up there since morning.

46:47.346 --> 46:49.383
What's he doing?

46:49.473 --> 46:51.556
Listening to his thoughts.

46:58.941 --> 47:01.729
Does he know yet
we got his message through?

47:01.819 --> 47:03.811
He's not been down.

47:05.448 --> 47:07.280
And I dare not go up.

47:09.493 --> 47:11.325
Are we waiting
for his permission?

47:12.371 --> 47:13.452
No.

47:14.248 --> 47:16.535
But we need the boat.

47:16.625 --> 47:18.742
And so we need enough men
with us to haul it.

47:20.963 --> 47:23.205
This needn't be
a second mutiny.

47:24.050 --> 47:25.632
He'll see reason.

47:30.723 --> 47:33.181
I'd rather take our chances
without the boat

47:33.267 --> 47:35.350
and get there much faster.

47:36.312 --> 47:39.555
We can beat the thaw
and get across the ice back to the ship.

47:39.648 --> 47:42.186
We'll do what we have to do,
Tommy.

47:42.276 --> 47:44.268
But we'll do it tomorrow.

47:52.787 --> 47:54.779
At ease, Jopson.

47:54.872 --> 47:56.238
At ease.

48:00.961 --> 48:03.123
Something I can do for you, sir?

48:03.214 --> 48:04.580
Yes.

48:05.299 --> 48:08.383
You can lie there,
not feeling well...

48:09.136 --> 48:11.253
while I try
and cheer you up...

48:11.347 --> 48:13.213
by telling you the story
of the time

48:13.307 --> 48:15.720
anyone ever let me ride a cow.

48:17.061 --> 48:20.725
I know that story ends with you
head first in a compost heap.

48:21.857 --> 48:22.938
Mm-hm.

48:24.068 --> 48:26.151
Well, would you like
to hear it or not?

48:32.034 --> 48:33.115
Yes.

48:36.288 --> 48:40.578
The cow in question...
it belonged to a neighbor.

48:41.419 --> 48:43.456
- Foley.
- Yes.

48:43.546 --> 48:45.629
Coilin Foley.

48:45.714 --> 48:48.297
He used to kick that cow
when he wanted it to move.

48:49.844 --> 48:51.881
It never wanted to move.

48:51.971 --> 48:56.215
She just stood in
her grass meadow all day long.

48:57.101 --> 48:58.888
Which is why
us children thought

48:58.978 --> 49:00.765
she'd be a safe one
to climb up.

49:03.899 --> 49:08.610
So, the first trick was...
getting on top of the thing.

49:18.622 --> 49:21.285
- You're certain of this?
- Saw it, sir.

49:21.375 --> 49:23.788
Through the glass. It's there.

49:23.878 --> 49:26.086
How wide
would you guess it to be?

49:26.172 --> 49:28.334
Wide enough for our boats.
Yes, sir.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.508
Weeks.
This could save us weeks of travel.

49:32.595 --> 49:35.508
If the ice opens up enough, we could
row across the strait and into the river.

49:35.598 --> 49:38.181
- Shall we scout it properly?
- Without delay.

50:45.709 --> 50:47.541
Sir!

50:51.006 --> 50:53.089
Bobby!

50:55.261 --> 50:57.298
There's no need
for any violence.

50:57.388 --> 50:59.926
It's you we were sent for,
Captain.

51:00.933 --> 51:02.265
Only you.

51:06.272 --> 51:08.355
Then drop your arms.

51:10.150 --> 51:13.939
We'll not fire on you
and you'll not fire on us.

51:20.911 --> 51:21.992
Magnus!

51:22.079 --> 51:25.413
Hold your fire, damn you!

51:36.218 --> 51:39.461
You did well.
You did so well, son.

51:42.641 --> 51:44.724
Go on.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.311
Go be with your brother now.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.406
Stand up, please.

52:13.047 --> 52:15.209
I'll come with you.

52:15.299 --> 52:16.665
Sir.

52:17.926 --> 52:20.168
And you'll let
the rest of these men go.

52:21.639 --> 52:23.380
You have our word.

52:23.474 --> 52:26.433
We will, however,
take your arms.

52:31.482 --> 52:33.690
Gun down, Edward.

52:46.080 --> 52:48.914
Come back for Hartnell's body.

52:48.999 --> 52:50.581
Bury him.

52:52.211 --> 52:55.204
Then keep moving South
as planned.

52:55.297 --> 52:57.004
Don't wait for me.

52:57.091 --> 52:59.504
If I can, I'll catch up.

52:59.593 --> 53:00.800
Sir.

53:01.845 --> 53:04.428
You are to lead
the men forward, Edward.

53:08.936 --> 53:11.178
You and the others will live.

53:14.650 --> 53:16.733
I understand the order, sir.

53:20.989 --> 53:23.072
Let me hear it.

53:25.452 --> 53:26.909
We will live.

55:59.189 --> 56:02.933
What in the name of God
took you so fucking long?
