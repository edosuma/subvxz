-You know this ain't our spot, D.
-Sphere's crew don't know us.

-The more paper we take home.
-Did you see that cat?

05:06.176 --> 05:08.838

We are so glad
to have you here, DJ.

12:51.908 --> 12:54.604
You're in Atlanta, we'll get you
a Hawks jersey or something.

12:54.778 --> 12:56.211
Honey, nobody watches the Hawks.

12:56.379 --> 12:59.371
That's your uncle's way
of saying welcome to Georgia.

13:00.450 --> 13:02.782
You'll get used to the humidity.

13:18.868 --> 13:21.098
You must be so excited
to start school.

13:21.271 --> 13:22.602
Or nervous.

13:22.772 --> 13:24.967
But don't be. You'll do just fine.

13:25.809 --> 13:28.300
You know that's where
l met your uncle.

13:30.313 --> 13:31.575
You guys went to Truth?

13:31.748 --> 13:34.683

13:35.251 --> 13:38.379
Come on, let me show you
up to your room. This way.

13:43.994 --> 13:47.691
That's your bathroom over there,
and this is your room.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.795
lf you get tired of campus food,
you're more than welcome...

13:52.969 --> 13:55.802
...to spend your weekends
here with us, anytime.

13:55.972 --> 13:57.769
You know,
whatever makes you comfortable.

13:57.941 --> 13:59.499
Thanks.

14:03.546 --> 14:08.279
DJ, l didn't get a chance to tell you
at the funeral...

14:09.285 --> 14:11.276
...but you know we loved him.

14:12.722 --> 14:14.383
l know how close you two were.

14:16.593 --> 14:18.390
l gotta run and show a house...

14:18.561 --> 14:21.121
...so when l get back,
l'll make us all some dinner.

14:21.364 --> 14:22.353
Okay?

14:30.874 --> 14:33.172
Honey, go ahead
and help yourself to some apple pie.

14:33.343 --> 14:35.140
l know it's your favorite.

14:35.311 --> 14:36.710
No, no, thanks.

14:39.082 --> 14:41.846
You know l had to call in a favor
to get you into this school.

14:42.018 --> 14:43.349
-Don't make me look bad.
-Nate.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.511
-No, that's cool. l'm listening.
-Good.

14:45.688 --> 14:47.918
Because the rules are very simple.

14:48.291 --> 14:50.088
There's three things
you have to deal with.

14:50.627 --> 14:54.688
First, you must keep your grades up
at all times.

14:54.864 --> 14:57.492
Second, l'm in charge
of your work study program...

14:57.667 --> 14:59.567
...but you'll not be
treated differently...

14:59.736 --> 15:02.569
...nor will you behave any different
than my other 26 employees.

15:02.739 --> 15:05.333
-And third?
-lf there's a strike three, you out.

15:05.742 --> 15:07.300
Period.

15:16.152 --> 15:17.847
DJ?

15:36.873 --> 15:38.636
What the hell is going on, man?

15:42.178 --> 15:45.807
l'm not gonna sit out here and act
like l wanna be here when l don't.

15:45.982 --> 15:48.883
This whole college boy thing
is not for me, man.

15:51.955 --> 15:54.150
You're the only thing
your mama's got left.

15:54.657 --> 15:58.058
There's no way l'm gonna let you
put my sister through any more pain.

15:58.495 --> 16:02.431
So you better make this college thing
work out. Can you appreciate that?

16:04.667 --> 16:08.125
Get your black ungrateful ass
in the goddamn truck.

16:13.309 --> 16:15.573
What'd l say, man? Get in the truck!

16:29.826 --> 16:32.260
At least you don't have a problem
with waking up early.

16:32.629 --> 16:35.621
Looks like you're just in time
for registration.

17:29.152 --> 17:30.881
Next.

17:49.639 --> 17:51.436
Yo, yo, hold my spot real quick.

18:10.159 --> 18:11.751
-This is my spot, thanks.
-Excuse me?

18:11.928 --> 18:14.328
-There was a girl saving my space.
-Nice try.

18:14.497 --> 18:16.488
You have to wait in line
like everybody else.

18:16.666 --> 18:18.691
You saw me
behind the sister with the fro.

18:18.868 --> 18:20.392
Next.

18:21.571 --> 18:23.300
Now, one of you come up
to the counter.

18:54.103 --> 18:57.561
<i>I'm just saying it's a little early
to tell, Mom, That's all,</i>

18:59.108 --> 19:01.406
<i>No, I'm not saying I hate it,</i>

19:02.679 --> 19:06.513
l'm not quitting. l promised you l'd try.
That's my word.

19:07.784 --> 19:09.513
l love you too.

19:09.686 --> 19:12.120
Okay. Bye.

19:27.937 --> 19:29.404
All right.

19:30.106 --> 19:33.405
There are only a select few things
of mine that are absolutely off-limits.

19:33.576 --> 19:37.945
My toothbrush, my toothpaste,
my shaving cream, and my condoms.

19:38.614 --> 19:40.844
Magnums, of course.
You know about the gold packs?

19:41.017 --> 19:43.349
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:44.620 --> 19:47.214
Other than that, playboy,
anything else of mine...

19:47.390 --> 19:49.051
...you're welcome to. Rich Brown.

19:50.793 --> 19:53.284
-DJ.
-Nice to meet you, sir.

19:53.763 --> 19:56.630
The Deltas
are having a little barbecue.

19:57.433 --> 20:00.027
-l've got some juice, l can get you in.
-l gotta work.

20:00.603 --> 20:03.197

Okay, l feel you. Which--?

Don't just stand there, man.
Sit down.

20:40.743 --> 20:42.506
ls this your office?

20:45.982 --> 20:48.974
Awfully nice digs for somebody
who cuts grass.

20:49.152 --> 20:50.744
No, l don't cut grass.

20:52.422 --> 20:53.650
But you do.

21:08.771 --> 21:10.898
<i>You ever wonder
where them trains be going?</i>

21:12.708 --> 21:14.699
They probably be going to Japan
or something.

21:14.877 --> 21:16.708
-Japan?
-Oh, yeah, they can't cross water.

21:16.879 --> 21:19.347
You going to college?
Don't say that when you get there.

21:19.515 --> 21:20.880
l'm just playing with you, man.

21:21.050 --> 21:25.646
The key to success in going to school,
what you do, you get a group of girls...

21:25.822 --> 21:27.414
...you get them
to do your homework.

21:27.924 --> 21:30.791
<i>When they do your homework,
you get A 's,</i>

21:41.571 --> 21:44.335
-How's it going, man?
-l'm still standing.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.804
Get in, man.

22:00.423 --> 22:02.653
Come on. Come on.
Pass the ball. Pass the ball.

22:02.825 --> 22:05.919
Yeah, baby. Go deep. Go long.

22:09.365 --> 22:11.799
They're getting the
very same education as you...

22:12.201 --> 22:14.192
...so don't pay them any mind.

22:25.381 --> 22:26.575
Oh, check it out.

22:26.749 --> 22:29.513
Oh, that's old news, brother.

22:29.719 --> 22:31.311
-You're lying.
-l'm not lying.

22:32.388 --> 22:33.719
Rich--

22:37.026 --> 22:38.653
DJ, right?

22:38.828 --> 22:41.160
My new roommate, DJ.
DJ, that's my friend Noel.

22:41.364 --> 22:42.524
Good to meet you, brother.

22:46.502 --> 22:47.935
Now, Thetas.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.803

22:56.379 --> 22:58.677
Are we the Pythons?

23:01.017 --> 23:04.145
-What the hell are they doing, man?
-They're stomping the yard.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.151
<i>Yes,</i>

23:07.690 --> 23:09.157
Where are you from?

23:09.325 --> 23:11.190
-The Thetas are representing.
-All day.

23:53.436 --> 23:56.064
Yo, get your hands off me, dog.

23:58.474 --> 24:00.874
Fool, you're about

24:01.077 --> 24:03.136
Throw his ass to the wolves!

24:06.415 --> 24:08.440
Can l get up here, man?
Because l can't see.

24:08.618 --> 24:11.086
-Yeah?
-Hey, isn't that your boy, DJ?

24:11.253 --> 24:12.845
Hold it, G.

24:13.022 --> 24:14.250
Listen, man.

24:14.423 --> 24:16.220

if you're crazy or stupid...

24:16.392 --> 24:18.724
-...but you gotta keep it moving.
-Hey, Zeke!

24:19.795 --> 24:21.660
When you're done playing
with your bitch...

27:05.928 --> 27:08.692
<i>The seven-year champs are here,</i>

27:08.864 --> 27:12.197
<i>The seven-year champs are here,</i>

27:12.368 --> 27:16.304
<i>The seven-year champs are here,</i>

27:25.281 --> 27:27.943
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:28.317 --> 27:29.807
How are you doing?

27:31.453 --> 27:35.219
Aren't you that guy that was fighting
with that girl in the line?

27:35.724 --> 27:37.624
Yeah, but it wasn't like that.

27:38.060 --> 27:39.550
April!

27:40.262 --> 27:41.729
-Hey, babe.
-What's up, baby girl?

27:41.931 --> 27:45.298
-l thought l told you to wait for me.
-l know, l had to go to the library.

27:46.168 --> 27:48.261
-Who's your friend?
-DJ.

27:48.971 --> 27:51.462
DJ was just passing by.

27:52.208 --> 27:54.039
Oh, yeah. l remember you.

27:54.210 --> 27:56.474
You're the idiot
that tried to break our step line.

27:56.812 --> 27:59.440
Yeah, well, it seems like DJ
has a thing with lines.

28:02.184 --> 28:04.118
You see those flags there?

28:04.286 --> 28:07.346
You don't mess with the Mus
and you don't mess with my girl.

28:09.525 --> 28:11.220
l'm gonna bounce.

28:38.254 --> 28:40.051
You don't know
what you're talking about.

28:40.256 --> 28:42.622
Here, it's all about the haves
and the have-mores.

28:42.791 --> 28:46.158
Either you come in first place
or you're not even in the game, player.

28:46.328 --> 28:49.092
Oh, yo, guys, this is DJ.

28:49.265 --> 28:51.927
You know Noel, this is Byron, Paul.

28:52.334 --> 28:53.892
-That's Easy over there.
-What's up?

28:54.370 --> 28:56.668
Yo, get that camera out of my face,
man.

28:57.172 --> 29:00.107
l was saying Theta Nu Theta is
gonna wipe the floor with Mu Gamma.

29:01.076 --> 29:03.101
-How's that?
-Because l'm gonna join.

29:03.279 --> 29:06.510
Dude, why are you pledging
Theta anyway? They tired.

29:06.682 --> 29:09.173
-They pull no women.
-They never win step championships.

29:09.351 --> 29:11.444
-So?
-''So?''

29:12.021 --> 29:13.886
-What else is there?
-What about history?

29:14.089 --> 29:16.853
What about tradition?
Give me my damn hat.

29:17.026 --> 29:18.755
-What about legacy?
-A legacy of losing.

29:19.228 --> 29:21.696
He's just saying that
because his father was a Theta.

29:21.864 --> 29:23.832
Anyway, DJ,
please ignore their ignorance.

29:23.999 --> 29:26.593
You need to roll with us
to the Rep Yo' City Blast tonight.

29:26.769 --> 29:28.532
-Roll with us.
-To the what?

29:31.907 --> 29:35.343
Where my St. Louis folks at?
S-T-L, show some love.

29:35.511 --> 29:39.572
You know how we do it every week at
the Phoenix! Give me love, Miami.

29:40.082 --> 29:43.051
C-H-l,
my Chicago folks in the building.

29:43.252 --> 29:45.584
Show some love.
Give it up for the A hometown people.

29:45.754 --> 29:47.153
Where you at? Show your A.

29:47.323 --> 29:49.450
l see you, Jamaica.
Do your thing, mon.

29:51.593 --> 29:55.256
Watch out for the lovely ladies
in blue and white. l see you.

29:56.465 --> 29:57.693
-What's up, sir?
-What's up?

29:57.866 --> 29:59.493
You good, man?

29:59.668 --> 30:02.159
Oh, damn, Rich.
You hanging with the freshmen now?

30:02.338 --> 30:03.896
-What?
-Oh, no. This is my roommate.

30:04.073 --> 30:05.665
This is DJ. DJ, this is Grant.

30:05.841 --> 30:09.675
That's nice. But see,
this section is for upperclassmen.

30:10.412 --> 30:12.812
You know what we call freshmen?

30:13.015 --> 30:16.246
We call them bootlickers,
because that's all they good for.

30:17.953 --> 30:19.648
You know
what we call guys like you?

30:19.822 --> 30:21.619
-No, what?
-Pretenders.

30:22.891 --> 30:25.416
-You're gonna wish l was pretending--
-You don't know me.

30:25.594 --> 30:26.959
Okay, okay! Okay, okay!

30:27.129 --> 30:29.620
And on that note,
we gonna go to the bar.

30:30.399 --> 30:31.889
Y'all have a good night.

30:32.434 --> 30:34.425
Why you so sensitive, dog?

30:34.603 --> 30:37.265
lt's a little freshman hazing.
We all have to go through it.

30:37.439 --> 30:39.270
Straight up,
that dude is whack, man.

30:39.441 --> 30:42.842
Well, maybe.
But he's Zeke's prodigy.

30:43.012 --> 30:45.640
-Who the hell is Zeke?
-He's the head of Mu Gamma.

30:45.881 --> 30:47.644
Seven-time national step champs.

30:47.816 --> 30:50.751
And your boy, Grant, he's next in line
to take the throne.

30:50.919 --> 30:52.750
-Just chill.
-You're killing me with that.

30:52.921 --> 30:55.549
Every week, you know
how we do it in the Phoenix.

30:55.724 --> 30:57.123
Go to the dance floor.

30:57.292 --> 31:00.193
Rep your city, wherever you're from.
lt's about that time.

31:00.362 --> 31:03.160
We got N-Y-C, obviously.

31:12.975 --> 31:15.409
l hope he had a condom on.

31:17.446 --> 31:18.970
What's he doing?

31:23.619 --> 31:25.883
-Didn't think you were coming.
-What are you doing?

31:26.055 --> 31:27.886
Come on.
Don't play at being jealous.

31:28.057 --> 31:29.388
l'm not playing at anything.

31:29.558 --> 31:30.786
lt was just a show.

31:31.326 --> 31:32.725
Well, l didn't like it.

31:32.895 --> 31:36.490
lt's not like l was doing it for real.
l was just adding a little flavor.

31:36.665 --> 31:39.429
Keep yourself looking this fine,
you ain't never gotta worry.

31:40.335 --> 31:41.666
Excuse me?

31:41.837 --> 31:44.067
Hey, Grant. Where are you at?
Your city needs you.

31:44.239 --> 31:46.605
Sit down with your girls,
have another drink on me...

31:46.775 --> 31:48.402
...and watch your man do his thing.

31:55.284 --> 31:57.684
He's just being a man.

31:58.220 --> 32:01.383
There isn't a single woman in here
that wouldn't kill to be with him.

32:01.690 --> 32:04.557
-Don't make it easy on them.
-You know you don't deserve that.

32:08.397 --> 32:09.955
lt's not that big of a deal.

32:10.132 --> 32:12.327
Didn't l tell you to keep
your distance from my girl?

32:12.534 --> 32:15.298
See, now, l thought you was just
pretending again.

32:15.471 --> 32:18.372
New York City, where you at?
Rep your city, it's your turn!

32:18.540 --> 32:20.565
Grant, they need you on the floor.

32:20.742 --> 32:23.370
When l'm done,
you better be gone...

32:24.346 --> 32:26.314
...bootlicker.

32:31.720 --> 32:34.314
-l can take care of myself.
-l know you can.

32:34.490 --> 32:37.084
No, really. Grant is not someone
you want to mess with.

32:37.259 --> 32:39.420
Somebody's gonna have to
bring him down a notch.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.661
What the hell is this nigga doing?

32:50.072 --> 32:53.200
What's this? lt looks like we got
a new addition added to the mix.

32:53.375 --> 32:55.900
Hey, yo, kid.
What city you representing?

32:56.078 --> 32:57.875
l ain't repping nothing. Just me.

33:27.476 --> 33:29.341
Oh, don't clown him. Don't clown him.

33:29.511 --> 33:32.378
You'll hurt him, Grant. Don't hurt him.

33:32.614 --> 33:34.343
Y'all know
how Grant does it, y'all.

33:34.683 --> 33:38.346
Give it up for G, Grant.
New York in the house!

33:59.007 --> 34:01.805
Oh, snap!
ls he clowning St. Louis?

34:04.880 --> 34:06.643
ls he breaking on Jamaica?

34:08.283 --> 34:10.978
Wait a minute.
Oh, he's clowning everybody!

34:11.152 --> 34:12.620
He's clowning on the Chi guy!

34:15.357 --> 34:19.851
Oh, this is crazy.
A-T-L, are you gonna take that?

34:23.831 --> 34:26.266
Miami! Even Miami!

34:35.377 --> 34:38.369
Wait a minute.
ls he coming at Grant?

34:46.922 --> 34:48.286
Wait, he's killing him!

34:51.525 --> 34:53.858
That's my roommate.
That's my roommate.

34:54.029 --> 34:55.724
Give it up, D!

34:55.964 --> 34:58.296
Oh, no, he didn't. Yes, he did.

35:12.347 --> 35:13.336
Yo, goodness.

35:15.717 --> 35:18.447
So l guess you thought
you were defending my honor, huh?

35:18.887 --> 35:22.220
-April, what are you doing?
-l'm just talking.

35:23.292 --> 35:26.159
You don't have to let this dude
talk to you like that.

35:26.628 --> 35:28.493
-Let's just drop it.
-No. What did you say?

35:28.664 --> 35:31.064
Somebody'll have to teach you
how to talk to a woman.

35:31.233 --> 35:33.758
-You gonna show me?
-l already schooled you once tonight.

35:33.935 --> 35:36.836
-How much do you wanna learn?
-What, you think you funny, nigga?

35:37.005 --> 35:39.269
Nah...but she clearly does.

35:39.841 --> 35:42.071
-What? No, no, no, Grant.
-lt's all good, baby.

35:42.244 --> 35:43.472
-Let's go.
-Come on.

35:43.645 --> 35:44.873
Hey, stop.

35:45.047 --> 35:48.107
Grant, stop it, stop. Stop.

35:48.317 --> 35:49.545
-Let's go.
-Stay out of this.

35:49.718 --> 35:51.117
All right, just chill. Grant.

35:51.286 --> 35:53.754
l ain't got nothing against you,
but l told you already.

35:53.922 --> 35:56.482
-This is my roommate, man.
-You do what you gotta do.

35:56.658 --> 35:58.683
Noel, l thought
you was gonna pledge Mu Gamma.

35:58.860 --> 36:01.420
-l was gonna--
-l guess you can kiss that goodbye.

36:01.797 --> 36:02.786
l'm gonna bounce.

36:02.964 --> 36:05.091
We got unfinished
business, bootlicker.

36:05.801 --> 36:08.326
-lndeed.
-Come on, let's go.

36:08.503 --> 36:11.939
l got myself here.
l can get myself home.

36:12.107 --> 36:14.268
Maya, will you take me home?

36:28.423 --> 36:31.881
Chill out, man.
This is a friendly visit.

36:32.494 --> 36:35.122
l'm Zeke,
president of Mu Gamma Xi.

36:35.297 --> 36:36.958
You know Grant.

36:37.232 --> 36:39.359
We saw you at the Phoenix
and we were impressed.

36:40.369 --> 36:41.893
Ain't that right, Grant?

36:42.904 --> 36:43.962
Yeah.

36:45.707 --> 36:46.696
l got work to do, man.

36:50.345 --> 36:52.040
Wolves!

36:52.414 --> 36:54.314
Y'all heard the man. Get busy.

37:00.322 --> 37:03.257
Now that you got time
on your hands, let's talk.

37:05.594 --> 37:07.528
Look, l brought Grant with me
to show you...

37:07.696 --> 37:09.823
...that we don't have
any hard feelings.

37:10.699 --> 37:14.226
You're a straight-up guy. l like that.
Working your way through college.

37:14.436 --> 37:16.700
That's admirable,
but this whole gardening thing...

37:16.872 --> 37:19.397
...can't be getting you any play
with the ladies, man.

37:19.574 --> 37:21.166
Never had any problems
in that area.

37:21.343 --> 37:24.039
Okay,
now l'll get straight to the point.

37:24.212 --> 37:29.047
Mu Gamma Xi has the strongest
alumni network, period.

37:29.217 --> 37:31.082
One phone call from us
when you graduate...

37:31.253 --> 37:33.483
...you've got a high-paying job
just like that.

37:33.655 --> 37:35.520
So you want me to join your frat?

37:35.857 --> 37:37.882
lf you step on our line.

37:38.693 --> 37:41.958
Step on the line. l don't step, man.

37:42.898 --> 37:43.887
l battle.

37:45.133 --> 37:47.693
-What's the difference?
-Pussies step.

37:50.305 --> 37:53.297
You should think about what you say
before you say it.

37:54.976 --> 37:56.204
Wolves!

37:57.779 --> 37:59.576
That's enough.

38:00.115 --> 38:01.946
Let's let Mr. DJ get back to his....

38:04.252 --> 38:06.152
His gardening.

38:10.192 --> 38:12.990
-You were right.
-l told you.

38:16.998 --> 38:18.192
l'm telling you, Sly.

38:18.800 --> 38:21.633
You didn't see
this dude punk Grant.

38:21.803 --> 38:25.500
Look, l'm sure he's a cool dude,
l just don't think he's Theta material.

38:25.674 --> 38:26.936
You mean he's too ghetto.

38:27.108 --> 38:28.473
l don't care where he's from.

38:28.643 --> 38:30.634
l don't think he got here
based on his SAT's.

38:30.812 --> 38:33.610
Okay, fine, so he's not the archetype
of a Theta, but what he--

38:33.782 --> 38:36.717
We got other pledges to consider
who have more impressive résumés.

38:36.885 --> 38:37.874
Thank you.

38:38.053 --> 38:40.078
But are they gonna help us
win Nationals?

38:40.255 --> 38:42.723
Okay, okay,
so that's what this is about?

38:42.891 --> 38:46.418
What are you thinking? Aren't you sick
of living in Mu Gamma's shadow?

38:55.170 --> 38:57.695
l'm sorry. Mind if l join you?

39:01.943 --> 39:03.501
Suit yourself.

39:05.514 --> 39:07.880
l'm here to talk to you
about Theta Nu Theta.

39:09.484 --> 39:11.111
You're kidding, right?

39:11.286 --> 39:12.810
No.

39:13.889 --> 39:16.551
-What about it?
-Members of my pledge committee...

39:16.725 --> 39:19.819
-...feel you'd be an asset to the house.
-No.

39:19.995 --> 39:22.259
Mu Gamma's murdered your asses
for seven years.

39:22.430 --> 39:24.295
You're here
because you think l can help.

39:24.466 --> 39:27.060
You know, you're cocky for a brother
that's got one trick.

39:27.235 --> 39:28.566
Please spare me, man.

39:30.105 --> 39:31.470
Spare you, fine.

39:31.640 --> 39:34.473
There's a screening process.
All applicants go through it.

39:34.643 --> 39:35.803
You want to apply?

39:36.578 --> 39:37.806
That's up to you.

39:37.979 --> 39:40.038
Mu Gamma comes here
offering me a sweet deal.

39:40.215 --> 39:43.514
And the best you can come up
with is l can apply?

39:43.685 --> 39:48.315
lf a sweet deal is really what
you're looking for, Theta ain't for you.

39:48.490 --> 39:53.621
A fraternity, now, that's a brotherhood
of men who forge a lifetime bond.

39:55.063 --> 39:58.590
Okay, once you are a Theta, you will
always and forever be a Theta.

39:58.767 --> 40:01.827
Now, you can go out of here,
you can leave Truth...

40:02.003 --> 40:04.733
...as a young educated brother
from the 'hood.

40:04.906 --> 40:06.203
And homey, that's great.

40:07.609 --> 40:11.943
But if you pledge Theta, you're gonna
get that same education...

40:12.113 --> 40:15.844
...and you'll become a member
of our lifetime brotherhood.

40:37.906 --> 40:40.534
-Yo, what's up?
-Hey, hey, what are you doing?

40:40.709 --> 40:42.643
You almost just ran me over
with that thing.

40:42.811 --> 40:45.541
-l didn't mean to scare you. My bad.
-What?

40:48.650 --> 40:50.709
lt's the dance thug from the club.

40:51.653 --> 40:53.883
So can we move on from that?

40:54.055 --> 40:55.613
Move on to what?

40:55.790 --> 40:57.451
l don't know.

40:57.926 --> 40:59.154
You getting to know me?

41:00.228 --> 41:01.855
l have a boyfriend.

41:02.030 --> 41:06.228
So, what's up with this Grant?
What is he, a professional student?

41:06.401 --> 41:08.392
Grant is in a six-year law program...

41:08.570 --> 41:12.097
...and his father's a partner with a Wall
Street firm, so when he graduates--

41:12.273 --> 41:15.868
lt's funny, because l didn't take you as
the type of girl that could be bought.

41:16.044 --> 41:17.375
Bought?

41:17.846 --> 41:19.074
Bought.

41:19.247 --> 41:22.683
Wait, l didn't mean bought like that.
l didn't mean bought like that. Listen.

41:22.851 --> 41:24.512
-What?
-Let's just start over.

41:24.686 --> 41:27.120
-Start what over?
-Have lunch with me.

41:27.288 --> 41:28.846
l'm tutoring.

41:30.759 --> 41:33.592
Tutor what? What do you tutor?

41:53.081 --> 41:54.275
Yo.

41:54.449 --> 41:56.940
-Hi, can l help you?
-l'd like to sign up for a tutor.

41:57.118 --> 41:58.813
Okay. What subject?

41:58.987 --> 42:02.013
What subject
does April Palmer tutor?

42:02.524 --> 42:04.890
-History.
-History it is.

42:25.613 --> 42:27.604
How'd you pull this off?

42:27.782 --> 42:29.147
What?

42:29.484 --> 42:31.008
What, you think l set this up?

42:31.186 --> 42:33.552
Well, it's an awful big coincidence,
don't you think?

42:35.290 --> 42:37.224
What you take me for?
Some kind of stalker?

42:37.392 --> 42:39.724
Like l'm gonna work that hard
to get your attention.

42:39.894 --> 42:43.762
l mean you're fine, but you ain't
all that, you know what l'm saying?

42:43.932 --> 42:45.399
Did l set this up?

42:46.868 --> 42:48.768
Can l use your pen?

42:48.937 --> 42:50.837
-Yeah. Okay.
-Thanks.

42:52.507 --> 42:53.838
So where do we start?

42:54.542 --> 42:57.272
You can start by moving over there.

43:00.749 --> 43:03.775
-Really?
-No, l'm serious.

43:03.952 --> 43:07.080
lt works better if we can sit
across from each other.

43:08.890 --> 43:10.517
All right.

43:18.133 --> 43:21.193
This is gonna be good
reading material for you.

43:22.470 --> 43:24.404
Time to go.

43:24.773 --> 43:27.708
-Thank God. l'm starving.
-So let's go eat.

43:28.476 --> 43:29.738
l can't.

43:30.111 --> 43:31.806
Why?

43:31.980 --> 43:33.880
You know why.

43:39.521 --> 43:41.113
Why are you staring at me?

43:43.925 --> 43:45.449
Okay.

43:46.127 --> 43:47.651
l'll make you a deal.

43:47.829 --> 43:50.923
Ask me any question
from the history lesson, l get it right...

43:51.099 --> 43:52.566
...we go eat.

43:56.704 --> 43:57.932
Okay.

43:59.741 --> 44:01.800
What was the difference
between Republicans'...

44:01.976 --> 44:03.841
...and the Democrats'
political response...

44:04.012 --> 44:06.674
...to the Great Depression
in the 1 930s?

44:14.222 --> 44:16.656
Some other time maybe.

44:16.825 --> 44:20.158
But by political response, were you
referring to the Republicans' belief...

44:20.328 --> 44:22.319
...that the marketplace
will correct itself...

44:22.497 --> 44:24.294
...as opposed to
the Democrats' New Deal?

44:24.465 --> 44:26.763
Because the way
you phrased it was....

44:28.837 --> 44:30.202
l'll get my uncle's truck.

44:30.872 --> 44:32.635
l'll drive.

44:44.185 --> 44:46.949
So l heard the Mu Gammas
are trying to recruit you.

44:47.522 --> 44:49.490
So are you gonna pledge?

44:49.657 --> 44:52.353
Probably not. l don't wanna step.

44:52.527 --> 44:55.826
Being in a fraternity is about
a lot more than just stepping.

44:56.264 --> 44:59.131
Wow, you sound just like them.

45:01.102 --> 45:04.401
-You should check out Heritage Hall.
-What's that?

45:04.772 --> 45:06.535
See for yourself.

45:07.575 --> 45:09.167
Oh, it's right up here on the right.

45:48.750 --> 45:51.981
How does a nice young girl like
yourself know about a place like this?

45:52.153 --> 45:53.882
We gonna take five. Be right back.

45:54.055 --> 45:57.081
There's a lot of things about me
you don't know.

46:22.984 --> 46:25.077
l didn't know you can do that.
l'm surprised.

46:25.253 --> 46:26.982
Let me show you how we do it in A.

46:27.422 --> 46:29.390
All right, l'm not mad.
l'm not mad at all.

46:29.557 --> 46:30.649
-Really?
-No.

46:33.261 --> 46:35.161
You wanna sit down?

46:37.465 --> 46:38.898
No.

47:34.789 --> 47:36.848
-l can't do this.
-What's wrong with this?

47:37.025 --> 47:39.721
-We're just having a little fun.
-l know. We just need to go.

50:36.871 --> 50:38.304
Let's heat it up.

51:08.603 --> 51:11.766
Yo, this one. Look at the map.
l'm telling you, it's this one.

51:17.678 --> 51:18.906
Quit playing, man.

51:19.447 --> 51:20.812
All in!

51:58.386 --> 52:00.684
-Since when?
-1 932.

52:01.122 --> 52:02.180
Bring it home!

52:03.658 --> 52:04.818
Bring it home!

52:07.128 --> 52:08.618
Come on!

52:12.066 --> 52:14.626
Pledges, turn...

52:14.802 --> 52:18.568
...and face big brother Zeus!

52:23.711 --> 52:26.942
Pledges, unmask yourselves!

52:34.221 --> 52:37.748
Pledges, Mu Gamma creed!

52:37.925 --> 52:40.120
<i>The year of completion,

52:40.294 --> 52:42.489

53:00.348 --> 53:05.081
<i>Oh, brother, we gotta keep pushing,
I wanna be a Theta Nu one day,</i>

53:05.252 --> 53:07.982
<i>So, big brother,
would you help me on my way?</i>

53:08.155 --> 53:12.285
<i>Oh, brother, we gotta keep pushing!
We gotta keep moving!</i>

53:12.460 --> 53:13.688
<i>We gotta keep fighting!</i>

53:13.861 --> 53:17.388
<i>Oh, brother, we gotta keep pushing!
We gotta keep moving!</i>

53:17.565 --> 53:18.896
<i>We almost there!</i>

53:20.601 --> 53:23.798
Pledges of Theta Nu Theta,

53:49.063 --> 53:50.792

54:38.479 --> 54:39.810
Payback's a bitch, ain't it?

54:41.282 --> 54:43.182
l'll see you at Nationals.

54:43.350 --> 54:44.612
Yes, you will.

54:45.186 --> 54:46.813
<i>-M-U!

<i>-Theta Nu!

54:50.324 --> 54:51.689
<i>-Theta Nu!

54:51.859 --> 54:53.258
<i>-M-U!

54:53.427 --> 54:55.156
<i>-Theta Nu!

54:55.329 --> 54:56.819
<i>-Theta Nu!
-Theta what?</i>

54:56.997 --> 54:58.294
<i>-M-U!
-Gamma Xi!</i>

54:58.466 --> 55:00.331
<i>-Theta Nu!
-Theta what?</i>

55:05.473 --> 55:08.533
All right. Well, just make sure
it's coming from the dean's office.

55:11.946 --> 55:14.972
Stewart, something's just come up.
l'll have to get back to you.

55:15.149 --> 55:18.380
-No problem.
-You don't have to get off the phone.

55:18.552 --> 55:20.611
Don't be silly. How's my baby?

55:20.788 --> 55:21.846
l'm doing good.

55:26.827 --> 55:30.024
<i>I heard
that you've been spending time,,,</i>

55:30.197 --> 55:32.529
<i>,,,with this young man, DJ,</i>

55:32.700 --> 55:34.463
Oh, you heard.

55:34.635 --> 55:37.035
So, what, did Grant call you?

55:37.404 --> 55:39.531
-Well, we spoke briefly--
-You know what, Dad?

55:39.707 --> 55:44.474
Ever since you've introduced me
to Grant, he's all you talk about.

55:44.645 --> 55:48.308
<i>Grant's gonna be a perfect provider,
and oh, Grant's going to the top,</i>

55:48.482 --> 55:50.780
Grant just thinks the world of you.
You know what?

55:50.951 --> 55:53.476
How about you and Grant hook up
and leave me out of it?

55:53.654 --> 55:55.246
Watch your tongue, young lady.

55:57.491 --> 55:59.618
This is ridiculous.

56:01.362 --> 56:03.455
l gotta go, Dad.

56:24.752 --> 56:26.947
-Hi.
-What's up?

56:29.023 --> 56:30.422
What's wrong?

56:31.892 --> 56:33.621
Nothing.

56:34.862 --> 56:37.296
Hey, you know,
if you wanna talk, l'm here.

56:41.569 --> 56:42.797
Thanks.

56:42.970 --> 56:44.437
All right.

56:46.974 --> 56:48.202
Congratulations.

56:50.911 --> 56:52.776
Why didn't you tell me
you pledged?

56:52.947 --> 56:54.915
Maybe l wanted to surprise you.

56:55.816 --> 56:57.647
As if l didn't already know.

57:03.958 --> 57:05.186
What?

57:05.993 --> 57:07.551
l like your earrings. They're nice.

57:07.728 --> 57:10.219
-They're new, right?
-Yeah.

57:10.831 --> 57:12.196
You noticed them?

57:12.666 --> 57:14.930
l notice everything about you.

57:15.102 --> 57:16.763
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

57:18.339 --> 57:20.204
So, what's my favorite color?

57:20.374 --> 57:21.602
Well....

57:22.142 --> 57:24.633
You always wear green eye shadow.

57:25.112 --> 57:27.546
Your favorite ring has green in it.

57:27.715 --> 57:30.707
And l'm gonna bet your car is green.

57:31.385 --> 57:32.750
Right?

57:38.025 --> 57:40.323
We should probably get started.

57:41.829 --> 57:43.228
Yeah.

57:48.736 --> 57:50.101
<i>Countdown, fellas,</i>

57:50.638 --> 57:54.267
For the next six weeks,
we prepare for the step show.

57:54.441 --> 57:56.602
Since we don't have time,
other members and l...

57:56.777 --> 58:00.110
...will take you through the basics
and break it down for you.

58:01.982 --> 58:04.177
<i>Some of you may think
you know what stepping is,</i>

58:04.351 --> 58:05.579
Keep going!

58:07.488 --> 58:09.479
<i>-But I assure you,,,
-Freeze!</i>

58:09.657 --> 58:14.253
<i>,,,until you have stepped
with Theta Nu Theta,,,you just don't,</i>

58:15.496 --> 58:17.464
One more time.
lt's gonna be a long day.

58:17.631 --> 58:18.859
Come on, Thetas!

58:19.033 --> 58:20.796
<i>-Move it, move it!
-I will do my part,</i>

58:21.802 --> 58:24.362
<i>But I need you to promise
to do yours,</i>

58:26.206 --> 58:30.734
<i>From this moment forward,
I will be your Step Master,</i>

58:31.478 --> 58:33.776
<i>-Come on. Let's go, baby boy.
-I teach, you learn,</i>

58:33.947 --> 58:35.278
Let's go.

58:35.449 --> 58:36.916
Come on.

58:39.887 --> 58:42.515
l'd like to see
a dessert menu, please.

58:44.825 --> 58:46.315
So how was your dinner?

58:47.027 --> 58:49.461
-lt was good.
-Good, good.

58:51.065 --> 58:54.762
April, there's been something
l've been wanting to talk to you about.

59:01.975 --> 59:04.466
lt belonged to my grandmother.

59:07.147 --> 59:08.944
lt's beautiful.

59:09.116 --> 59:10.947
Try it on.

59:22.262 --> 59:23.820
Grant....

59:28.502 --> 59:30.834
What's my favorite color?

59:32.439 --> 59:33.565
Red. Why?

59:35.476 --> 59:36.909
No, no, no.

59:37.411 --> 59:38.742
Blue.

59:40.781 --> 59:42.749
What's this about?

59:45.119 --> 59:46.347
l don't know.

59:49.590 --> 59:53.390
Please tell me this has nothing
to do with that kid.

59:56.797 --> 59:58.458
l'm sorry.

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:06.501
lf you don't come to your senses
and quick...

01:00:06.673 --> 01:00:09.141
...you are going to lose out on me.

01:00:12.079 --> 01:00:14.707
l really can't believe
you just said that.

01:00:16.183 --> 01:00:20.552
You are spoiled and ungrateful,
and l'm taking you home.

01:00:21.688 --> 01:00:23.417
You know what?

01:00:24.358 --> 01:00:26.121
Don't bother.

01:00:30.697 --> 01:00:34.098
My favorite color's green, asshole.

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.908
<i>T-H-E-T-A!</i>

01:00:59.026 --> 01:01:02.154
All right, stop. Stop!

01:01:02.696 --> 01:01:05.164
Please, put some heart
into what you're doing, fellas.

01:01:05.332 --> 01:01:06.560
Can l ask a stupid question?

01:01:06.733 --> 01:01:08.132
Better than anyone l know.

01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:11.298
What?

01:01:11.471 --> 01:01:14.167
l just wanted to know
why we're stepping in an empty pool.

01:01:15.742 --> 01:01:19.041
Well, it was so we could keep
our moves a secret.

01:01:19.479 --> 01:01:20.946
But who would want them?

01:01:21.114 --> 01:01:22.775
Let's pick this back up
tomorrow at 8.

01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:25.043
-Eight?
-Eight?

01:01:25.219 --> 01:01:26.743
You got a problem with 8?

01:01:27.855 --> 01:01:29.152
Let's make it 7.

01:01:29.323 --> 01:01:32.121
-What?
-Oh, man.

01:01:35.963 --> 01:01:37.362
l'm out of here.

01:02:41.228 --> 01:02:42.957
Are they putting this in the show?

01:02:43.897 --> 01:02:46.161
l don't think so. You know Sylvester.

01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:49.200
He doesn't like anything street
in his routines.

01:02:50.404 --> 01:02:51.894
Good.

01:02:53.407 --> 01:02:55.068
For us.

01:03:14.895 --> 01:03:16.886
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:03:17.998 --> 01:03:19.488
What's wrong?

01:03:24.304 --> 01:03:26.465
l broke up with him.

01:03:31.244 --> 01:03:32.973
You okay?

01:03:33.647 --> 01:03:36.241
l haven't slept all night.

01:03:40.687 --> 01:03:42.018
What have you been doing?

01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:44.484
Thinking.

01:03:48.061 --> 01:03:49.961
What are you thinking?

01:03:58.438 --> 01:04:00.668
l think l wanna come in.

01:04:06.813 --> 01:04:08.440
Come on.

01:04:18.458 --> 01:04:22.861
Don't forget. We gotta practice
on those new steps later on today.

01:04:26.333 --> 01:04:28.062
Check this out.

01:04:31.838 --> 01:04:33.066
Nice ride.

01:04:47.854 --> 01:04:49.981
l'll see you guys later.

01:05:18.418 --> 01:05:20.545
We'll pick it up first thing
in the morning.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:24.588
lf any of you have any conflicts
with your class schedules...

01:05:24.758 --> 01:05:26.020
...let me know.

01:05:27.194 --> 01:05:28.627
Prophytes.

01:05:36.603 --> 01:05:39.037
We have been going strong
for over two weeks now.

01:05:39.206 --> 01:05:40.730
And we still suck.

01:05:40.907 --> 01:05:42.135
We've got four weeks left.

01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:43.708
That's easy for you to say.

01:05:44.177 --> 01:05:46.077
You can do this stuff in your sleep.

01:05:46.246 --> 01:05:48.942
The problem is these lame-ass steps
they got us doing, man.

01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:50.577
So, what you saying?

01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:54.652
lnstead of us trying to fit step, we
gotta make step fit our natural rhythm.

01:05:54.821 --> 01:05:56.254
Here.

01:06:01.061 --> 01:06:02.289
That's nice.

01:06:02.462 --> 01:06:05.090
We're gonna try doing
something like that.

01:06:05.499 --> 01:06:08.093
-All right, we're gonna try something.
-How do you do that?

01:06:08.268 --> 01:06:11.169
Right on the beat.
You just hit it real quick. You go:

01:06:12.739 --> 01:06:15.469
Throw it in gear. You come here.

01:06:41.868 --> 01:06:43.859
What the hell was that?

01:06:45.805 --> 01:06:47.363
The steps you taught us
was played.

01:06:47.541 --> 01:06:50.339
You can't expect us to beat the Mus
with that and you know it.

01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:52.102
l'm trying to give something fresh.

01:06:52.279 --> 01:06:55.407
Are we doing a step show,
or are we doing a rap video?

01:06:55.582 --> 01:06:57.447
lt's a new day, man.

01:06:57.617 --> 01:06:59.847
l mean, l didn't sign on
to be no loser.

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:04.184
No, losing, it's a state of mind.

01:07:04.658 --> 01:07:06.956
-What?
-No disrespect, my brother.

01:07:07.127 --> 01:07:10.324
But this frat has been living in that
state for the last seven years.

01:07:10.497 --> 01:07:12.488
The reason you're holding on
to tradition...

01:07:12.666 --> 01:07:15.328
...is because you cannot keep up
with the present.

01:07:18.004 --> 01:07:19.562
l'll make you a bet.

01:07:20.173 --> 01:07:22.505
You go and you get
your line brothers together.

01:07:23.243 --> 01:07:25.302
And l'll get my guys.

01:07:25.478 --> 01:07:27.378
And we'll throw down.

01:07:28.415 --> 01:07:31.316
-You're on.
-Tomorrow night.

01:07:31.685 --> 01:07:33.585
At the Phoenix.

01:07:37.324 --> 01:07:39.349
You sure about this, man?

01:07:41.461 --> 01:07:43.395
Yeah, man. l got you.

01:07:44.331 --> 01:07:47.698
All right, y'all. We got the brothers
from the TNT step team in the house.

01:07:47.867 --> 01:07:50.529
Y'all know what it is.
lt's the age-old battle.

01:07:50.704 --> 01:07:55.368
Old school versus new school.
Here come the Neophytes.

01:08:11.491 --> 01:08:14.392
Time for the Prophytes to counter.

01:08:27.073 --> 01:08:28.301
Oh, yeah.

01:08:28.475 --> 01:08:29.805
Here we go. Here we go.

01:08:29.975 --> 01:08:32.206
Oh, wait a minute,
they're doing the real thing.

01:08:32.379 --> 01:08:35.041
They're bringing the real stepping
into the mix.

01:08:38.285 --> 01:08:41.310
Okay, what you got for me, fool?
Let me see you bring it.

01:08:45.425 --> 01:08:48.451
Hold on, hold on. What's happening
with this kid? What's he doing?

01:08:48.627 --> 01:08:50.323
Oh, no, that's not gonna fly,
Phoenix.

01:08:50.497 --> 01:08:52.692
Y'all know the rules.
Group against group.

01:08:52.866 --> 01:08:55.130
What are you doing?
Come on, man.

01:08:55.301 --> 01:08:56.428
This is about the team.

01:09:02.408 --> 01:09:04.171
Man, why didn't you stick
with the plan?

01:09:04.344 --> 01:09:05.810
All my people in the Phoenix.

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:10.075
The prophytes of Theta Nu Theta
wanna show these neos how it's done.

01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:12.274
Prophytes step together now!

01:09:28.033 --> 01:09:29.261
Yeah.

01:09:29.435 --> 01:09:31.734
Hands down. No doubt about it.

01:09:31.904 --> 01:09:33.736
Show some love.
Y'all know what it is.

01:09:33.907 --> 01:09:37.240
Old school wins. Old school wins.

01:09:37.410 --> 01:09:42.676
Phoenix, you know you cannot mess
with the prophytes of Theta Nu Theta.

01:09:42.849 --> 01:09:45.340
<i>Prophytes! Prophytes! Prophytes!</i>

01:09:54.627 --> 01:09:57.118
-Y'all, l was just--
-Look, next time you show off...

01:09:57.297 --> 01:10:00.494
...do it on your own time, and save us
the practice you put us through.

01:10:00.667 --> 01:10:02.066
We hardly did any stepping.

01:10:02.235 --> 01:10:03.759
You know we should have won that.

01:10:03.937 --> 01:10:06.701
-lt was a slanted crowd. Come on.
-Please.

01:10:08.108 --> 01:10:10.838
lt ain't always about you, dog.

01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:12.807
We're a team.

01:10:14.614 --> 01:10:16.241
Come on, man.

01:10:23.823 --> 01:10:27.281
<i>It's not just about you,
it's about all of us, We're a team,</i>

01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:40.038
What's up?

01:10:41.007 --> 01:10:43.635
l owe all you guys an apology.

01:10:45.545 --> 01:10:47.945
l just wanna be part of the team.

01:10:55.188 --> 01:10:56.849
That's good.

01:10:57.023 --> 01:11:00.720
Because l'm gonna need you to teach
all of us some of your moves...

01:11:00.894 --> 01:11:03.692
...if we're gonna have any kind
of shot at Nationals.

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:13.271
Pizzas and beer on me!
l'll take my car. Who else is driving?

01:11:37.397 --> 01:11:39.194
<i>M-U!</i>

01:11:39.933 --> 01:11:41.924

01:12:34.153 --> 01:12:36.815
Top of the rock, baby.
Top of the rock. Come on.

01:12:50.336 --> 01:12:52.964
<i>Thetas, Thetas, we rep the Thetas,</i>

01:12:53.439 --> 01:12:56.067
<i>Thetas, Thetas, we rep the Thetas,</i>

01:12:56.242 --> 01:13:01.771
<i>Thetas, Thetas

Do your work.

01:13:39.218 --> 01:13:40.913
l'm done.

01:13:43.456 --> 01:13:46.220
Well, l still have one more chapter
to read.

01:13:51.164 --> 01:13:53.530
<i>Remember you wanted me
to check up on DJ?</i>

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:59.036
Well, meet
Mr. Darnell James Williams.

01:13:59.439 --> 01:14:01.100
''Youth slain in brawl.

01:14:01.274 --> 01:14:03.970
Brother and three other youths
charged with assault.''

01:14:05.411 --> 01:14:06.503
All right, come on.

01:14:06.679 --> 01:14:09.375
l'll take you to the place that makes
the best fried chicken.

01:14:09.549 --> 01:14:12.609
With a record like that, you would
think he would keep a low profile.

01:14:12.785 --> 01:14:16.448
Everyone knows that Darrows fries
the best chicken in all of Georgia.

01:14:16.623 --> 01:14:18.818
Twenty bills if this ain't the best
fried chicken.

01:14:18.992 --> 01:14:20.220
-Twenty bills?
-Twenty bills.

01:14:20.393 --> 01:14:23.385
So basically,
the brother's a criminal.

01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:26.122
What a shame.

01:14:27.133 --> 01:14:28.464
You're on.

01:14:34.273 --> 01:14:37.367
l gotta run in and get something
real quick. lt'll just take a second.

01:14:37.543 --> 01:14:39.374
You can come in.

01:14:39.779 --> 01:14:41.747
Just trust me. Come on.

01:14:46.786 --> 01:14:48.253
Hello?

01:14:48.955 --> 01:14:50.479
lt's me.

01:14:52.659 --> 01:14:54.752
-Oh, hey there.
-Hey, Unc.

01:14:54.927 --> 01:14:57.862
This is my friend, April.

01:14:58.031 --> 01:14:59.862
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

01:15:00.033 --> 01:15:02.228
-Baby, is that you?
-Yes, it is Sunday, right?

01:15:02.969 --> 01:15:04.197
Just in time.

01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:06.531
-And who is this lovely lady?
-April.

01:15:06.706 --> 01:15:08.469
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

01:15:08.641 --> 01:15:10.131
Hope you're hungry.

01:15:10.877 --> 01:15:14.142
You can set your watch by my Aunt
Jackie's Sunday night fried chicken.

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:22.615
Those are the most beautiful tulips.

01:15:22.789 --> 01:15:24.256
-Thank you, baby.
-You're welcome.

01:15:24.424 --> 01:15:25.652
They are my favorite.

01:15:25.825 --> 01:15:29.727
Nate brings them for me every Sunday
since the day we were engaged.

01:15:29.896 --> 01:15:32.330
-lsn't that sweet?
-Are you taking notes?

01:15:32.498 --> 01:15:33.795
See? See what you started?

01:15:33.966 --> 01:15:36.127
-l mess up a lot.
-Yes, you do.

01:15:36.302 --> 01:15:38.896
Listen, guys, there's plenty more
so don't be shy.

01:15:39.072 --> 01:15:42.132
Yes, this is the best chicken
l've had.

01:15:42.308 --> 01:15:43.741
Thank you.

01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:46.003
Your cooking actually reminds me
of my mom's.

01:15:46.546 --> 01:15:47.911
She must be a damn good cook.

01:15:48.081 --> 01:15:52.575
She was a good cook.
She passed away five years ago.

01:15:52.752 --> 01:15:54.947
l'm sorry to hear that.

01:15:55.555 --> 01:15:57.386
Yeah, it was tough.

01:15:57.557 --> 01:16:00.993
But, you know,
me and my dad are real close.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.720
Her dad's the provost.

01:16:05.364 --> 01:16:07.491
<i>-El capitan,
-Yep.</i>

01:16:07.667 --> 01:16:10.966
-You're Palmer's daughter?
-Yeah.

01:16:15.541 --> 01:16:19.033
Auntie, when are you gonna teach me
how to make this fried chicken?

01:16:19.212 --> 01:16:21.237
-l'm not gonna do it, sweetheart.
-Why?

01:16:21.414 --> 01:16:23.746
Because then l'll never see you
on Sunday anymore...

01:16:23.916 --> 01:16:26.282
...and l need to see my boy
every Sunday.

01:16:39.966 --> 01:16:43.458
Five, six...

01:16:43.636 --> 01:16:47.470
...seven, eight.

01:16:59.252 --> 01:17:01.584
<i>Smooth,</i>

01:17:02.922 --> 01:17:04.753
<i>T-H-E-T-A!</i>

01:17:04.924 --> 01:17:08.917

<i>Theta Nu!</i>

01:17:29.282 --> 01:17:32.115
Continuous-- Yes, come in.

01:17:36.489 --> 01:17:41.085
Mr. Darnell James Williams,
you're wanted in the Dean's Office.

01:17:42.128 --> 01:17:44.688
According to the information
provided to us...

01:17:44.864 --> 01:17:47.924
...you were charged with
and convicted of aggravated assault...

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:51.297
...in a brawl that resulted
in the death of your brother.

01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:52.960
ls this correct?

01:17:55.007 --> 01:17:57.305
l was trying to protect him.

01:17:58.978 --> 01:18:01.811
The thing is, if l had told you
the truth about my conviction...

01:18:01.981 --> 01:18:03.972
...l wouldn't be here anyway.

01:18:04.150 --> 01:18:06.175
So either way,
l was screwed from the get-go.

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.447
So l guess the only thing
left to say is that...

01:18:11.824 --> 01:18:16.659
...since l've been here,
l've become a better person.

01:18:42.021 --> 01:18:44.717
lt is the decision of this committee...

01:18:44.891 --> 01:18:47.325
...to suspend you
for the remainder of the year.

01:18:49.195 --> 01:18:51.561
l'm sorry, Mr. Williams.

01:19:03.943 --> 01:19:05.240
Yo, DJ!

01:19:14.086 --> 01:19:15.553
D?

01:19:25.064 --> 01:19:29.091
You all right, man?
What's going on?

01:19:30.703 --> 01:19:33.695
-l'm out of here.
-What are you talking about?

01:19:33.873 --> 01:19:35.101
l'm suspended.

01:19:35.775 --> 01:19:37.970
How the hell can they do that?

01:19:45.818 --> 01:19:47.410
Hello?

01:19:47.954 --> 01:19:49.751
Yeah, this is him.

01:19:51.891 --> 01:19:53.256
When?

01:19:54.994 --> 01:19:56.586
Yeah, yeah. l'll be there.

01:19:56.762 --> 01:19:59.856
D, what's going on? D!

01:20:08.007 --> 01:20:09.634
Come in.

01:20:10.009 --> 01:20:13.410
Excuse me, Dr. Palmer.
DJ Williams.

01:20:14.113 --> 01:20:16.445
Have a seat, Mr. Williams.

01:20:21.754 --> 01:20:24.188
The Ethics Committee
reports to my office...

01:20:25.524 --> 01:20:28.618
...but l seldom interfere
with their decisions.

01:20:29.328 --> 01:20:33.822
l have the authority
to have you reinstated.

01:20:37.036 --> 01:20:38.264
So, what's the catch?

01:20:38.437 --> 01:20:43.739
This thing you have going
with my daughter, it ends now.

01:20:43.909 --> 01:20:47.345
-What does that have to do with--?
-Look, you little shit.

01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:51.443
My daughter is not some shorty
for you to mess with.

01:20:51.617 --> 01:20:54.313
She's a woman with a bright
and promising future...

01:20:54.487 --> 01:20:57.945
...and l'm not gonna have you
come here and take advantage of her.

01:20:58.124 --> 01:21:00.422
-Excuse me?
-Am l not getting through to you?

01:21:02.928 --> 01:21:07.763
lf you don't agree
to stop seeing my daughter...

01:21:07.967 --> 01:21:10.299
...you can kiss
your education goodbye.

01:21:12.505 --> 01:21:17.204
And you'll end up just like your uncle,
cutting grass for a living.

01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:20.972
Now, how long do you think
April will go out with you then?

01:21:24.316 --> 01:21:25.943
Well....

01:21:27.019 --> 01:21:28.884
With all due respect...

01:21:30.689 --> 01:21:32.316
...sir...

01:21:33.292 --> 01:21:37.388
...it's her decision, not yours.

01:21:39.498 --> 01:21:41.466
You have a good day.

01:21:47.406 --> 01:21:49.135
Three days before the Nationals.

01:21:49.975 --> 01:21:53.172
Are you sure there's nothing we can
do to help change Dr. Palmer's mind?

01:21:53.345 --> 01:21:55.973
-No, he's one of them.
-Palmer's a Mu Gamma?

01:21:56.882 --> 01:21:59.350
-That's right.
-Damn.

01:21:59.819 --> 01:22:00.911
We are screwed.

01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:06.884
You guys are unbelievable, man.

01:22:10.362 --> 01:22:12.762
You will be leaving here in three,
what, four years...

01:22:12.932 --> 01:22:15.457
...with your fancy job
offers in your pockets.

01:22:16.235 --> 01:22:18.863
lt's my ass getting kicked
to the curb, man.

01:22:19.038 --> 01:22:21.768
This is my life that's messed up.

01:22:23.109 --> 01:22:25.976
This is not about
no damn Nationals.

01:22:38.290 --> 01:22:40.986
Did he tell you
he has a criminal record?

01:22:41.794 --> 01:22:43.193
What criminal record?

01:22:43.362 --> 01:22:45.296
And l suppose he hasn't told you...

01:22:45.464 --> 01:22:48.399
...that he's been brought up
before the Ethics Committee...

01:22:48.567 --> 01:22:50.865
...for lying on his
scholarship application?

01:22:51.036 --> 01:22:53.368
What are you talking about?

01:23:07.453 --> 01:23:09.683
l was just about to call you.

01:23:15.828 --> 01:23:17.853
So it's true.

01:23:21.433 --> 01:23:23.560
What do you want me
to say to you, April?

01:23:23.736 --> 01:23:25.601
l believed in you.

01:23:26.205 --> 01:23:28.730
Why wouldn't you just tell me?

01:23:32.111 --> 01:23:34.477
l got arrested because l was....

01:23:36.382 --> 01:23:38.646
Because l was fighting
and my brother got killed.

01:23:40.319 --> 01:23:43.049
lt wasn't my fault. The only
reason l got convicted was...

01:23:43.222 --> 01:23:46.316
...because l had a public defender who
couldn't even remember my name.

01:23:50.262 --> 01:23:52.355
Then why are you leaving?

01:23:52.698 --> 01:23:54.598
Good question.

01:23:55.234 --> 01:23:57.134
Why don't you go ask your father?

01:24:06.278 --> 01:24:08.269
He would have given me back
my scholarship...

01:24:08.447 --> 01:24:10.176
...had l agreed to break up with her.

01:24:10.349 --> 01:24:12.442
And you said no?

01:24:12.618 --> 01:24:14.779
l wasn't gonna let him play me.

01:24:17.356 --> 01:24:20.655
-lt was my fault.
-l don't get it.

01:24:29.568 --> 01:24:32.765
l dated Will Palmer back at Truth.

01:24:32.938 --> 01:24:36.635
My junior and most of my senior year
until l met your uncle.

01:24:40.312 --> 01:24:44.442
-You stole his girl?
-lt's not that simple.

01:24:49.255 --> 01:24:54.124
l wish you would've told me that
before it blew up in my face.

01:24:59.231 --> 01:25:01.290
<i>What's up, world?
This is Sway with MTV News,</i>

01:25:01.467 --> 01:25:03.025
Coming to you live from Atlanta...

01:25:03.202 --> 01:25:06.035
...for the 1 7th Annual Step Show
Championships.

01:25:08.807 --> 01:25:12.607
The Atlanta Arena will be overflowing
as thousands of fans have gathered...

01:25:12.778 --> 01:25:14.712
...from far and wide
for the competition.

01:25:15.381 --> 01:25:17.042
Hundreds of applications
poured in...

01:25:17.216 --> 01:25:19.844
...but only 25 teams
were chosen from universities...

01:25:20.019 --> 01:25:24.547
...from all across the country
to compete in the ultimate showdown.

01:25:28.861 --> 01:25:31.489
This year, defending champions
Mu Gamma Xi...

01:25:31.664 --> 01:25:35.293
...go for their unprecedented
eighth title in a row.

01:25:35.467 --> 01:25:38.368
ls there anybody
that can stop these guys?

01:25:41.507 --> 01:25:42.735
Seven-year champs!

01:25:42.941 --> 01:25:45.876
Eight is on the way, baby.
Eight is on the way.

01:25:46.078 --> 01:25:48.478
Hey. Hey, Thetas, turn.
Get over here.

01:25:48.647 --> 01:25:51.514
Come on, fellas.
l know what you're thinking.

01:25:51.684 --> 01:25:55.347
But you're wrong.
Come on, we can still win this thing.

01:25:55.521 --> 01:25:57.148
Okay, now, l've been watching you.

01:25:57.323 --> 01:25:58.551
And l can promise you...

01:25:58.724 --> 01:26:01.420
...we are not the same Thetas
that we were six weeks ago.

01:26:01.593 --> 01:26:03.857
You ain't never seen stepping
like this before.

01:26:04.029 --> 01:26:06.327
So get ready. lt's about to go down!

01:26:06.498 --> 01:26:08.295
-Let's go!
-You ready?

01:26:08.467 --> 01:26:10.526
-All right.
-Let's go.

01:26:10.703 --> 01:26:13.228
Let's go. Let's go.
Theta on three. One, two, three:

01:26:13.405 --> 01:26:14.173
<i>Theta!</i>

01:26:18.010 --> 01:26:19.671
Hello, William.

01:26:24.016 --> 01:26:26.507
lt's been a long time, Jackie.

01:26:27.152 --> 01:26:29.950
-William, how could you?
-Look, if this is about--

01:26:30.122 --> 01:26:32.215
DJ told us about the deal
that you offered him.

01:26:32.391 --> 01:26:33.983
All l'm trying to do is make sure...

01:26:34.159 --> 01:26:36.855
...my daughter doesn't make
the same mistake you made.

01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:39.561
l didn't make a mistake, William.

01:26:40.999 --> 01:26:42.694
You know how different
your life would be--

01:26:42.868 --> 01:26:44.597
lf l would have married you?

01:26:45.537 --> 01:26:48.199
William, l have a really good life.

01:26:48.874 --> 01:26:51.866
Well, it's not good enough
for my daughter.

01:26:52.811 --> 01:26:55.279
Shouldn't that be my choice?

01:27:06.325 --> 01:27:11.228
Dad, if you think me being with Grant
is what's best for me...

01:27:12.464 --> 01:27:16.560
-...then you don't even really know me.
-Baby, you are all l have left.

01:27:17.703 --> 01:27:19.432
Well, you just lost that.

01:27:19.605 --> 01:27:22.130
-Look, sweetheart, don't say that.
-Just stop it.

01:27:22.307 --> 01:27:26.004
l know l can forgive you for this
one day, but l really....

01:27:27.246 --> 01:27:29.840
l really can't imagine when.

01:27:30.516 --> 01:27:33.917
Just give me a chance to fix things.

01:27:41.393 --> 01:27:42.758
The procedure is simple.

01:27:42.928 --> 01:27:44.793
Teams compete
in an elimination round.

01:27:44.963 --> 01:27:47.431
Only four teams
are chosen to go to the finals.

01:27:47.599 --> 01:27:51.262
These four teams will compete
for the $40,000 grand prize...

01:27:51.437 --> 01:27:54.235
...to use for the community service
project of their choice.

01:27:54.406 --> 01:27:58.775
And let's not forget,
bragging rights for the year.

01:28:01.346 --> 01:28:04.213
Let the elimination rounds begin.

01:29:35.641 --> 01:29:39.475
Let's hear it for the sorority finalists.

01:29:42.047 --> 01:29:45.710
Let's hear it
for the fraternity finalists.

01:29:46.518 --> 01:29:48.850
This is us, fellas.
Get them pythons up.

01:29:51.056 --> 01:29:52.580
Hi.

01:29:53.859 --> 01:29:55.793
-ls he here?
-Sure, sure.

01:29:55.961 --> 01:29:59.226
Hold on one second.
DJ, would you come down?

01:30:17.883 --> 01:30:20.875
l know about the offer
that my dad made.

01:30:23.522 --> 01:30:26.013
All you had to do was talk to me.

01:30:26.658 --> 01:30:30.617
-l know.
-l should have stayed in L.A.

01:30:31.964 --> 01:30:34.660
Everything l touch gets screwed up.

01:30:37.202 --> 01:30:39.727
My brother's dead and that's on me.

01:30:39.905 --> 01:30:41.839
DJ....

01:30:43.742 --> 01:30:45.972
That's not true.

01:30:46.144 --> 01:30:49.375
No, if it wasn't for me, he'd be here.
Duron would be here.

01:30:50.315 --> 01:30:51.907
Let it go.

01:30:55.587 --> 01:30:58.021
Just let it go.

01:31:04.262 --> 01:31:06.162
lt's okay.

01:31:10.602 --> 01:31:12.627
l love you.

01:31:20.545 --> 01:31:24.675
lt's not your fault. Okay?

01:31:29.655 --> 01:31:31.213
Okay, l want to tell you something.

01:31:33.225 --> 01:31:37.594
My dad overturned
the committee's decision.

01:31:39.297 --> 01:31:44.701
He'd much rather put up with you
in my life than lose me in his.

01:31:48.206 --> 01:31:49.867
But l don't know if that's for me.

01:31:50.642 --> 01:31:52.269
But l thought this was your dream.

01:31:53.945 --> 01:31:56.379
lt's my brother's dream.

01:31:57.182 --> 01:32:01.118
He was supposed to be this.
Not me.

01:32:02.821 --> 01:32:05.312
Well, then do it for your brother.

01:32:06.758 --> 01:32:09.124
Do it for Duron.

01:32:11.730 --> 01:32:14.961
The elimination rounds are over
and only the finalists remain.

01:32:15.133 --> 01:32:19.160
This is the last chance for these teams
to let out all the stops.

01:32:19.371 --> 01:32:22.534
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

01:32:22.708 --> 01:32:27.475
...thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on Earth as it is in heaven.

01:32:27.679 --> 01:32:31.308
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses...

01:32:31.483 --> 01:32:34.111
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:32:34.286 --> 01:32:37.813
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

01:32:37.989 --> 01:32:41.049
...for thine is the kingdom, the power,
the glory forever.

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.785
Amen.

01:32:44.663 --> 01:32:47.427
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the defending champions...

01:32:47.599 --> 01:32:53.196
...the unstoppable
brothers of Mu Gamma Xi.

01:33:12.224 --> 01:33:13.691
Wolf pack launch!

01:33:20.966 --> 01:33:22.593
Give it to me one time.

01:33:22.768 --> 01:33:24.326
Give it to me two times.

01:33:24.503 --> 01:33:25.868
Give it to me three times.

01:33:39.785 --> 01:33:41.218
Wolf pack slide.

01:33:43.922 --> 01:33:49.258

01:33:49.427 --> 01:33:52.089

01:35:25.824 --> 01:35:29.351
Sylvester!
l can't let you save the best for last.

01:35:29.527 --> 01:35:31.654
Because the crowd
out there is really feeling us.

01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:34.390
Man, what's it to you, dog?
Why don't you mind your own--?

01:35:34.566 --> 01:35:36.864
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's go.
-All right.

01:35:46.044 --> 01:35:47.375
You're suspended.

01:35:49.981 --> 01:35:52.814
lt seems like your man Dr. Palmer
changed his mind.

01:35:53.919 --> 01:35:56.012
You're not gonna matter.

01:35:57.956 --> 01:35:59.253
You never did.

01:35:59.424 --> 01:36:01.949
Come on, Mus.
Where's my Mus at?

01:36:02.127 --> 01:36:03.685
So this is for real? You're back?

01:36:03.862 --> 01:36:05.352
Theta Nu, you're on.

01:36:05.530 --> 01:36:07.395
All right, huddle up,
huddle up, huddle up.

01:36:07.565 --> 01:36:09.795
Okay, now, we are TNT.

01:36:09.968 --> 01:36:12.528
That's one of the most powerful
explosives known to man.

01:36:12.704 --> 01:36:14.069
-And that's what we are.
-Right.

01:36:14.239 --> 01:36:16.036
That's what you are.
That's what you are.

01:36:16.207 --> 01:36:19.404
That's damn sure what you are,
and that is what we have always been.

01:36:19.577 --> 01:36:22.478
Okay, so tonight,
can we be explosive?

01:36:22.647 --> 01:36:24.137
-Yes!
-No, no.

01:36:24.316 --> 01:36:26.045
Can we be better
than we ever have been?

01:36:26.217 --> 01:36:29.618
-Yes!
-Because we are repping the Thetas.

01:36:29.788 --> 01:36:32.348
<i>Thetas, Thetas, we rep the Thetas,</i>

01:36:32.524 --> 01:36:35.049
<i>Thetas, Thetas, we rep the Thetas,</i>

01:36:35.226 --> 01:36:36.750
<i>Thetas, Thetas, we rep the:</i>

01:36:39.965 --> 01:36:45.301
And now, get ready for the brothers
of Theta Nu Theta!

01:37:42.127 --> 01:37:45.961
<i>T-H-E-T-A!</i>

01:37:47.298 --> 01:37:49.289

01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:26.498
<i>I got a feeling
Can't touch this!</i>

01:38:46.624 --> 01:38:48.558
All ours, we get.

01:40:11.075 --> 01:40:12.975
All right. That's it for the finals.

01:40:13.144 --> 01:40:15.806
Now it's all up to the judges.

01:40:32.330 --> 01:40:34.730
And now for the winner
of this year's...

01:40:34.899 --> 01:40:37.333
...National Fraternity
Step Team Champions....

01:40:39.504 --> 01:40:40.766
We have a tie.

01:40:44.008 --> 01:40:45.737
Now, l know
what you all are thinking...

01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:48.208
...but the judges
will not let this end in a tie.

01:40:48.379 --> 01:40:51.507
l'm gonna stay here live until
we have a definitive winner.

01:40:51.683 --> 01:40:53.810
Alpha Tau Chapter
of Mu Gamma Xi...

01:40:57.188 --> 01:40:59.952
...and Beta Delta Chapter
of Theta Nu Theta.

01:41:00.124 --> 01:41:04.424
We're gonna let y'all go
head-to-head one more time.

01:41:06.431 --> 01:41:10.527
Theta Nu Theta and Mu Gamma Xi,
are y'all ready to battle?

01:41:13.171 --> 01:41:16.368
-Then let's go!
-Come here.

01:41:19.544 --> 01:41:21.512
All right.
We're gonna need you, man.

01:41:21.679 --> 01:41:24.307
We're gonna need you
to bring this home for us.

01:41:24.482 --> 01:41:27.679
