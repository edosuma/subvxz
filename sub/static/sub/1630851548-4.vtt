11:48.800 --> 11:50.566
PEOPLE AND THEY ASK YOU ABOUT

11:50.633 --> 11:51.433
GROWING UP IN LAS VEGAS, IT'S AS

11:51.500 --> 11:52.633
IF YOU GREW UP IN A PIRATE SHIP

11:52.700 --> 11:54.400
OR SOMETHING.

11:54.466 --> 11:59.300

12:32.533 --> 12:34.533
ONE PLACE IN AMERICA THAT WILL

STAFF AND I'M DOING MY SHOW FOR

13:19.766 --> 13:20.100

13:21.766 --> 13:23.700
IT WAS YOUR STAFF AND THEY WERE

13:23.766 --> 13:24.433
A GREAT CROWD.

13:24.500 --> 13:28.800
>> THEY WERE GREAT FOR YOU.

13:28.866 --> 13:32.066
I HAVE AN IDEA, MY STAFF IS SICK

13:32.133 --> 13:33.000

13:36.033 --> 13:37.733
TRADE STAFFS, IT WILL BEIKE

13:41.566 --> 13:42.700
I HAVE ANOTHER PLAN AND I THINK

13:42.766 --> 13:44.733
THIS IS A GOOD PLAN.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.633
I'M TIRED OF DOING THE SHOW FOR

13:46.700 --> 13:47.766
MY STAFF AND THEY ARE MORE TIRED

13:47.833 --> 13:51.066
THAN I AM OF IT, SO WHO IS THE

13:51.133 --> 13:52.200
GROUP THAT HAS BEEN VACCINATED

14:11.633 --> 14:13.433
TALK SHOW THAT DID THAT, IT WAS

14:13.500 --> 14:17.766
CALLED THE MERV GRIFFIN SHOW.

[LAUGHTER]

14:19.733 --> 14:21.633
I LOVE -- YOU WERE TOO YOUNG.

14:21.700 --> 14:26.166

14:35.066 --> 14:35.600
IN A DAY.

14:35.666 --> 14:38.366
HE WANTED TIME OFF, HE HAD OTHER

14:38.433 --> 14:39.000
ACTIVITIES.

14:39.066 --> 14:40.933
IN VEGAS.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.600
WITH DANNY TERRIO.

14:45.666 --> 14:49.300
IT WAS 3:30, 4:30, FIVE: 30 --

14:49.366 --> 14:51.766
AT 3:30, THERE WAS NOBODY THERE

14:51.833 --> 14:53.966
UNDER 112 YEARS OLD AND I'M 28

14:54.033 --> 14:58.233
AND TRYING TO DO COMEDY WITH

14:58.300 --> 14:58.566
THESE PEOPLE.

14:58.633 --> 15:01.100

15:01.166 --> 15:02.533
>> Bill: I WAS WATCHING VIEW,

15:12.033 --> 15:13.333
THE TOP DESTINATION FOR PEOPLE

15:13.400 --> 15:13.933
LEAVING CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A

15:14.000 --> 15:15.333
BIG THING.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.466
THERE'S A BIG EXODUS, I READ IT

15:18.533 --> 15:20.433
IN THE PAPER, ALL THE TECH GUYS.

15:20.500 --> 15:20.800
>> TO MIAMI?

15:20.866 --> 15:24.300
>> Bill: YES.

15:24.366 --> 15:26.366
I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO

15:26.433 --> 15:27.533
CALIFORNIA HOPEFULLY TONIGHT, A

15:27.600 --> 15:28.966
LITTLE LATER, I DO HAVE

15:29.033 --> 15:30.466
SOMETHING AT THE DESK WHICH I

15:30.533 --> 15:33.533
WANT TO SHOW -- I HAVE MY

15:33.600 --> 15:34.666
PROBLEMS WITH CALIFORNIA.

15:34.733 --> 15:37.533
THE REGULATIONS AND TAXES AND

15:37.600 --> 15:40.166
THE FIRES LET IDAHO, LET'S TALK

15:40.233 --> 15:41.133
ABOUT IDAHO.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.166
I ONCE WENT ON VACATION TO

15:43.233 --> 15:44.200
SOUTH DAKOTA WHICH IS NOT A

15:44.266 --> 15:45.200
PLACE YOU THINK YOU WOULD FIND

15:45.266 --> 15:48.366
ME AND I HAD A GREAT TIME.

15:48.433 --> 15:49.700
AGAIN, I WOULDN'T WANT TO LIVE

15:49.766 --> 15:53.033
THERE, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING

15:53.100 --> 15:53.566
ABOUT THOSE STATES AND THE

15:53.633 --> 15:55.600
PEOPLE IN THEM, YOU TELL ME WHAT

15:55.666 --> 16:00.433
IT IS.

16:00.500 --> 16:01.633
>> FOR US, THE REASON WE WENT

16:01.700 --> 16:04.500
THERE -- I BOUGHT A PLACE IN

16:04.566 --> 16:05.566
IDAHO, THAT'S A MUCH I LIKE IT

16:05.633 --> 16:05.800
THERE.

16:05.866 --> 16:07.466
WE HAD BEEN IN THE HOUSE WITH

16:07.533 --> 16:10.166
THE KIDS FOR TOO LONG AND SO WE

16:10.233 --> 16:11.133
DECIDED, I BOUGHT AN RV WE

16:11.200 --> 16:13.066
DECIDED TO PUT THEM IN A SMALLER

16:13.133 --> 16:15.733
HOUSE THAT WOULD MAKE THEM THROW

16:15.800 --> 16:18.866
UP AND WE WANTED TO JUST GET OUT

16:18.933 --> 16:20.566
AND SEE THE COUNTRY AND BREATHE

16:20.633 --> 16:25.200
THE AIR AND EAT AT CHILI'S -- WE

16:25.266 --> 16:25.900
DIDN'T REALLY STOP ANYWHERE

16:25.966 --> 16:28.600
ALONG THE WAY, WE KEPT IT VERY

16:28.666 --> 16:29.333
SELF CONTAINED.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.366
WE WENT UP TO IDAHO AND IT WAS A

16:31.433 --> 16:33.933
GREAT TIME, WE GOT TO GO, WE SAW

16:34.000 --> 16:35.733
MOUNT ZION AND THE KIDS GOT TO

16:35.800 --> 16:36.833
LOOK AT YOUTUBE ON THEIR iPADS

16:36.900 --> 16:39.966
IN MOUNT ZION [LAUGHTER]

16:40.033 --> 16:41.466
AND THEN WE GOT BACK IN THE RV,

16:41.533 --> 16:42.833
THE TRIP BACK IS NO GOOD BECAUSE

16:42.900 --> 16:44.000
YOU KNOW YOU'RE HEADED HOME, YOU

16:44.066 --> 16:46.800
KNOW WHAT'S IN STORE.

16:46.866 --> 16:48.000
THE ONE THAT SAYS SOMETHING

16:48.066 --> 16:48.533
RIGHT THERE.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.600
>> THAT DOES SAY SOMETHING.

16:50.666 --> 16:52.633
WE GET BACK IN THE RV AND WE

16:52.700 --> 16:53.766
STOP IN THIS CAMPGROUND THEY HAD

16:53.833 --> 16:56.500
THESE NICE TENTS SET UP AND WE

16:56.566 --> 16:57.933
GET THE KIDS IN THE BED AND WE

16:58.000 --> 16:59.333
ARE LAYING IN A TENT AND IT'S

16:59.400 --> 17:00.433
HOT, REALLY HOT, NO AIR

17:00.500 --> 17:02.266
CONDITIONING -- DID YOU KNOW

17:02.333 --> 17:03.333
TENTS DON'T HAVE AIR

17:03.400 --> 17:04.833
CONDITIONING?

17:04.900 --> 17:07.266
>> Bill: TENTS.

17:07.333 --> 17:08.833
>> AND I'M LAYING THERE AND I

17:08.900 --> 17:11.466
SAY TO MY WIFE, LET'S DRIVE TO

17:11.533 --> 17:12.000
VEGAS.

17:12.066 --> 17:14.900
WE PACKED THE KIDS UP, WE GOT IN

17:15.000 --> 17:17.733
THE RV AND WE DROVE TO CAESAR'S

17:17.800 --> 17:20.400
PALACE AND THEY HAVE PARKING FOR

17:20.466 --> 17:21.133
RVs AT CAESAR'S PALACE AND

17:21.200 --> 17:23.066
THAT'S WHERE WE SPENT THE LAST

17:23.133 --> 17:23.266
NIGHT.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.600
>> Bill: DRIVE THEM OVER THE

17:25.666 --> 17:27.300
SNAKE RIVER LIKE EVEL KNIEVEL

17:27.366 --> 17:29.100
DID.

17:29.166 --> 17:32.466
JIMMY, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

17:32.533 --> 17:34.700
IF TEARS IN EYES.

17:34.766 --> 17:36.266
>> SORRY ABOUT THE PARKING SPOT

17:36.333 --> 17:38.766
I WILL CHANGE IT TO KEITH

17:38.833 --> 17:39.800
HERNANDEZ OR SOMETHING.

17:39.866 --> 17:41.766
>> Bill: JIMMY KIMMEL, THANKS,

17:41.833 --> 17:44.500
PAL.

17:44.566 --> 17:48.933
LET'S MEET OUR PANEL!

17:49.000 --> 17:49.800
OKAY.

17:49.866 --> 17:50.700
HERE THEY ARE.

17:50.766 --> 17:52.066
HE'S THE HOST OF "THE REASON

17:52.133 --> 17:52.766
ROUNDTABLE" PODCAST AND CO-HOST

17:52.833 --> 17:59.000
OF "THE FIFTH COLUMN" PODCAST:

17:59.066 --> 18:01.166
TURTLE PODCASTS!

18:01.233 --> 18:01.466
MATT WELCH.

18:01.533 --> 18:05.266
TURTLE PODCASTS.

18:05.333 --> 18:06.300
SHE'S THE SENIOR CORRESPONDENT

18:06.366 --> 18:06.933
AT TIME AND AUTHOR OF "THE ONES

18:07.000 --> 18:07.566
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR: HOW A

18:07.633 --> 18:08.433
NEW GENERATION OF LEADERS WILL

18:08.500 --> 18:09.033
TRANSFORM AMERICA": CHARLOTTE

18:09.100 --> 18:21.866
ALTER.

18:21.933 --> 18:23.566
BEFORE I LET YOU TWO TALK WANT

18:23.633 --> 18:26.766
TO SHOW THIS THING, DAYS WAITING

18:26.833 --> 18:28.433
FOR SOLAR.

18:28.500 --> 18:34.800
PEOPLE WHO WATCH MY SHOW NO I

18:34.866 --> 18:36.700
HAVE BEEN BITCHING, I HAVE BEEN

18:36.766 --> 18:37.400
BITCHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT

18:37.466 --> 18:38.733
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THE

18:38.800 --> 18:39.900
SOLAR TURNED ON AT MY HOUSE FOR

18:39.966 --> 18:41.866
OVER THREE YEARS.

18:41.933 --> 18:43.800
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO WANT SOLAR

18:43.866 --> 18:44.433
RIGHT AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

18:44.500 --> 18:45.133
GOOD TO?

18:45.200 --> 18:48.233
I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

18:48.300 --> 18:50.633
I READ IN A COLUMN LAST WEEK,

18:50.700 --> 18:52.300
THE PENTAGON WAS BUILT IN 16

18:52.366 --> 18:56.500
MONTHS DURING THE WAR 500 DAYS

18:56.566 --> 18:58.400
WRITTEN EMPIRE STATE BUILDING,

18:58.466 --> 19:02.300
410 DAYS DURING THE DEPRESSION.

19:02.366 --> 19:03.233
THE LITTLE SHED TO COME I HAD TO

19:03.300 --> 19:08.733
BUILD A LITTLE SHED TO HOUSE THE

19:08.800 --> 19:09.866
SOLAR BECAUSE IT COMES IN ON A

19:09.933 --> 19:14.733
POLE BUT THE POLL ISN'T GOOD FOR

19:14.800 --> 19:18.866
SOLAR -- THE SHED JUST GOT BUILT

19:18.933 --> 19:20.733
LIKE TWO OR THREE MONTHS AGO, I

19:20.800 --> 19:23.300
JUST GOT THE SHED IN, NOW WE

19:23.366 --> 19:27.833
JUST HAVE TO TURN ON, 1,082

19:27.900 --> 19:28.066
DAYS.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.200
KNOW IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS

19:30.266 --> 19:31.700
TOMORROW AND I JUST WANT THESE

19:31.766 --> 19:32.633
PEOPLE TO KNOW, I'M GOING TO

19:32.700 --> 19:37.500
LEAVE THIS HERE.

19:37.566 --> 19:39.666
I JUST THINK THIS IS A TERRIBLE

19:39.733 --> 19:42.000
ADVERTISEMENT FOR DEMOCRATS.

19:42.066 --> 19:44.233
>> THE NEIGHBORHOOD I GREW UP IN

19:44.300 --> 19:46.333
CALIFORNIA IN LONG BEACH IS THE

19:46.400 --> 19:47.566
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT --

19:47.633 --> 19:48.833
>> Bill: YOU GREW UP HERE?

19:48.900 --> 19:51.600
>> YEAH, LIKE 60,000 PEOPLE.

19:51.666 --> 19:52.900
IT WAS BUILT IN A YEAR AND A

19:52.966 --> 19:55.733
HALF IN THE 1950s.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.566
GRANTED, THERE WAS LAND BACK

19:57.633 --> 19:59.166
THERE BUT CALIFORNIA DOESN'T

19:59.233 --> 20:00.666
BUILD THINGS AND THEN GETS

20:00.733 --> 20:01.866
REALLY SURPRISED WHEN IT HAS

20:01.933 --> 20:03.300
TONS OF HOMELESS PEOPLE.

20:03.366 --> 20:05.733
IF YOU DON'T ALLOW THINGS TO GET

20:05.800 --> 20:07.200
BUILT IF YOU DRAG OUT APPROVAL

20:07.266 --> 20:09.100
PROCESSES FOREVER, WHAT HAPPENS?

20:09.166 --> 20:10.666
YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING

20:10.733 --> 20:13.933
AND EVERYONE IS PERPETUALLY

20:14.000 --> 20:15.433
SURPRISED AS IF THIS MAGIC

20:15.500 --> 20:16.166
SUPPLY-DEMAND THING.

20:16.233 --> 20:18.300
YOU MAY NOT APPLIES ALSO TO

20:18.366 --> 20:18.966
HOUSING?

20:19.033 --> 20:20.600
IT DOES, SADLY.

20:20.666 --> 20:22.366
AND THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS A

20:22.433 --> 20:22.733
CULPRIT OF THAT.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.500
>> SO MUCH OF THIS IS BECAUSE WE

20:25.566 --> 20:27.100
HAVEN'T DECIDED IT'S A NATIONAL

20:27.166 --> 20:28.766
PROJECT TO GET PEOPLE SOLAR.

20:28.833 --> 20:31.400
IT HASN'T BEEN A PRIORITY FOR

20:31.466 --> 20:32.700
ANY REAL ADMINISTRATION EXCEPT

20:32.766 --> 20:33.766
POSSIBLY THIS ONE WHICH IS ONLY

20:33.833 --> 20:37.133
BEEN IN OFFICE FOR LIKE TWO

20:37.200 --> 20:38.033
WEEKS.

20:38.100 --> 20:38.566
>> Bill: IS A PRIORITY IN

20:38.633 --> 20:42.700
THEORY BUT IN PRACTICE.

20:42.766 --> 20:44.166
THAT'S THE THING, THEY TALK

20:44.233 --> 20:45.166
ABOUT IT LIKE IT'S A PRIORITY

20:45.233 --> 20:47.300
BUT THEN WHEN YOU GO AND DO IT,

20:47.366 --> 20:49.133
YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY GET IT DONE.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.033
>> HAVE THEY TOLD YOU YET ABOUT

20:51.100 --> 20:53.266
HOW YOU HAVE TO CLEAN IT EVERY

20:53.333 --> 20:53.533
18 MONTHS?

20:53.600 --> 20:58.733
>> Bill: I'LL LICK IT.

20:58.800 --> 20:59.466
[LAUGHTER]

20:59.533 --> 21:01.700
THIS WEEK I'M ALSO READING ABOUT

21:01.766 --> 21:03.400
THE FACT THAT 44 SAN FRANCISCO

21:03.466 --> 21:05.366
HIGH SCHOOLS, DID YOU SEE THIS?

21:05.433 --> 21:06.666
ARE HAVING TO CHANGE THEIR NAME

21:06.733 --> 21:09.600
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL BOARD HAD A

21:09.666 --> 21:12.100
BLUE RIBBON COMMITTEE THAT JUST

21:12.166 --> 21:13.266
WENT ON WIKIPEDIA AND LOOKED UP

21:13.333 --> 21:16.066
EVERYBODY'S NAME WHOSE ON A

21:16.133 --> 21:17.366
HIGH SCHOOL AND IF THEY FOUND

21:17.433 --> 21:21.566
ANYTHING, YOU KNOW WHO CAN'T BE

21:21.633 --> 21:23.366
ON A HIGH SCHOOL?

21:23.433 --> 21:23.766
GEORGE WASHINGTON,

21:23.833 --> 21:24.600
THOMAS JEFFERSON,

21:24.666 --> 21:26.933
ABRAHAM LINCOLN -- LINCOLN.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.666
DIANNE FEINSTEIN IS STILL A

21:31.733 --> 21:31.900
SENATOR.

21:31.966 --> 21:36.533
SHE'S BEEN A SENATOR A LONG TIM

21:36.600 --> 21:36.733
TIME.

21:36.800 --> 21:37.600
IN 1984, SHE'S THE MAYOR OF

21:37.666 --> 21:40.066
SAN FRANCISCO AND IF THERE ARE

21:40.133 --> 21:40.733
ALL THESE CULTURAL HISTORIC

21:40.800 --> 21:42.033
FLAGS IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING

21:42.100 --> 21:45.266
AND SOMEBODY TOOK DOWN THE

21:45.333 --> 21:46.500
CONFEDERATE FLAG AND SHE EITHER

21:46.566 --> 21:48.900
REPLACED IT OR DIDN'T STOP IT --

21:48.966 --> 21:52.900
WHO GIVES A FUCK?

21:52.966 --> 21:55.366
THIS IS NOT AFFECTING ANYBODY'S

21:55.433 --> 21:56.533
LIVES.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.066
IT'S A VIRTUAL SIGNALING OF I'M

21:58.133 --> 22:00.133
GOING TO DISAPPEAR THIS PERSON

22:00.200 --> 22:00.700
BECAUSE IN 1984 THEY DIDN'T

22:00.766 --> 22:02.800
REPLACE THE WHITE FLAG.

22:02.866 --> 22:06.900
I'M SAYING THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

22:06.966 --> 22:08.500
ISSUE BUT WHEN YOU CAN'T PUT UP

22:08.566 --> 22:09.800
THE FIRES AND YOU CAN'T BUILD A

22:09.866 --> 22:11.466
HOUSE, IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IS

22:11.533 --> 22:13.633
WHAT YOU SPEND YOUR TIME DOING.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.233
IT LOOKS TO A LOT OF THE

22:15.300 --> 22:16.633
COUNTRY, THIS IS WHAT THE LEFT

22:16.700 --> 22:18.900
IS OBSESSED WITH, NOT REAL

22:18.966 --> 22:21.666
PROGRESS, THIS NONSENSE.

22:21.733 --> 22:24.333
THERE'S A WAY IN WHICH THIS IS

22:24.400 --> 22:24.866
AN IMPORTANT ISSUE.

22:24.933 --> 22:27.566
>> THERE ARE 50,000 KIDS IN

22:27.633 --> 22:28.700
SAN FRANCISCO WHO HAVEN'T SET

22:28.766 --> 22:32.266
FOOT IN A SCHOOL FOR 329 DAYS --

22:32.333 --> 22:32.666
THINK ABOUT THAT.

22:32.733 --> 22:34.333
THAT'S APPALLING.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.266
YOU ARE A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND

22:36.333 --> 22:38.000
YOU HAVE ONE JOB, YOUR JOB IS TO

22:38.066 --> 22:39.266
PROVIDE EDUCATION TO KIDS.

22:39.333 --> 22:40.866
THEY ARE NOT DOING THAT JOB.

22:40.933 --> 22:42.300
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING

22:42.366 --> 22:44.766
FROM THAT JOB ARE POOR AND

22:44.833 --> 22:47.666
MINORITY KIDS MOST OF ALL AND

22:47.733 --> 22:49.000
INSTEAD OF SPENDING EVERY BIT OF

22:49.066 --> 22:51.333
TIME AND MONEY, YOU GOT TO

22:51.400 --> 22:52.666
CHANGE NAMES OF SCHOOLS, INSTEAD

22:52.733 --> 22:54.433
OF DOING THAT TO OPEN THE

22:54.500 --> 22:57.000
SCHOOLS INTO THE ONE JOB YOU'RE

22:57.066 --> 22:58.233
DOING THIS BAD WIKIPEDIA VIRTUAL

22:58.300 --> 22:58.933
SIGNALING WHERE PAUL REVERE GETS

22:59.000 --> 23:02.500
CANCELED FOR THE WRONG REASON.

23:02.566 --> 23:04.766
>> Bill: WHAT DID HE DO?

23:04.833 --> 23:05.866
>> HE DIDN'T RIDE FAST ENOUGH, I

23:05.933 --> 23:09.533
DON'T KNOW.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.066
[LAUGHTER]

23:11.133 --> 23:13.033
THE OTHER PART OF THIS IS THAT

23:13.100 --> 23:14.433
THIS KIND OF VIRTUAL SIGNALING

23:14.500 --> 23:16.533
IN THIS KIND OF POLITICAL

23:16.600 --> 23:17.166
CORRECTNESS IS ONE OF THE ONLY

23:17.233 --> 23:17.766
THINGS THAT IS DRIVING YOUNG

23:17.833 --> 23:21.900
PEOPLE TO THE RIGHT.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.466
>> Bill: YOUNG PEOPLE.

23:23.533 --> 23:25.166
>> NOT ALL YOUNG PEOPLE OF

23:25.233 --> 23:27.333
COURSE BUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT

23:27.400 --> 23:29.500
I'VE SPOKEN TO WHO ARE MOVING TO

23:29.566 --> 23:31.233
THE RIGHT WHO ARE BECOMING

23:31.300 --> 23:32.800
CONSERVATIVE, IT'S OFTEN BECAUSE

23:32.866 --> 23:33.533
OF STUFF LIKE THIS.

23:33.600 --> 23:34.966
IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T

23:35.033 --> 23:36.933
BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE, IT'S

23:37.000 --> 23:39.133
NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A

23:39.200 --> 23:40.700
DIFFERENCE -- THEY AREN'T DRIVEN

23:40.766 --> 23:42.700
BY TAXES, IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY

23:42.766 --> 23:44.633
HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS, IT'S

23:44.700 --> 23:46.833
BECAUSE THEY ARE FRUSTRATED WITH

23:46.900 --> 23:47.600
THIS TYPE OF LEFT-WING VIRTUAL

23:47.666 --> 23:49.533
SIGNALING AND WE EVEN SEE THAT

23:49.600 --> 23:52.566
IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY RIGHT

23:52.633 --> 23:54.000
NOW BECAUSE ALMOST ALL OF THE

23:54.066 --> 23:56.266
RISING STARS IN THE REPUBLICAN

23:56.333 --> 23:57.733
PARTY HAVE DEFINED THEMSELVES IN

23:57.800 --> 24:00.100
OPPOSITION TO CANCEL CULTURE.

24:00.166 --> 24:01.566
THEY HAVEN'T DEFINED THEMSELVES

24:01.633 --> 24:03.400
WITH ANY KIND OF REAL POLICY

24:03.466 --> 24:03.633
AGENDA.

24:03.700 --> 24:06.666
LOOK AT THE STANDING OVATION FOR

24:06.733 --> 24:09.966
MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE.

24:10.033 --> 24:11.266
THE QUICKEST WAY TO MAKE A HERO

24:11.333 --> 24:13.933
ON THE RIGHT IS TO CANCEL HIM ON

24:14.000 --> 24:14.200
THE LEFT.

24:14.266 --> 24:15.533
>> Bill: THEY ARE CO-OPTING

24:15.600 --> 24:17.466
THAT TERM.

24:17.533 --> 24:18.933
I HAVE MY ISSUES WITH CANCEL

24:19.000 --> 24:20.533
CULTURE LIKE I THINK A LOT OF

24:20.600 --> 24:21.833
SANE PEOPLE DO, JUST LIKE I HAVE

24:21.900 --> 24:25.433
ISSUES WHEN TRUMP WAS TALKING

24:25.500 --> 24:27.533
ABOUT -- WHEN PEOPLE WERE

24:27.600 --> 24:28.700
TALKING ABOUT TRUMP USING FAKE

24:28.766 --> 24:32.533
NEWS AND WITHIN WEEKS, TRUMPED

24:32.600 --> 24:35.466
UP THAT TERM AND MADE IT HIS.

24:35.533 --> 24:38.866
THAT STARTED OUT, THEM CALLING

24:38.933 --> 24:39.933
HIS ASS ON THAT, YOU'RE DOING

24:40.000 --> 24:40.866
FAKE NEWS AND THEN IT WAS HIM

24:40.933 --> 24:43.200
SAYING EVERYTHING IS FAKE NEWS.

24:43.266 --> 24:45.100
NOW I THINK THIS IS HAPPENING

24:45.166 --> 24:46.133
WITH CANCEL CULTURE.

24:46.200 --> 24:50.866
>> JIM JORDAN LITERALLY USED IT

24:50.933 --> 24:51.933
ABOUT MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE,

24:52.000 --> 24:52.533
WERE JUST GOOD HAVE TO COME UP

24:52.600 --> 24:55.733
WITH A DIFFERENT PHRASE TO

24:55.800 --> 24:56.100
DESCRIBE IT.

24:56.166 --> 24:57.833
IT HAS TO DO WITH ARE YOU

24:57.900 --> 24:59.333
GETTING UP ON SOMEONE WHO

24:59.400 --> 25:00.833
DOESN'T HOLD POWER -- IT'S NOT

25:00.900 --> 25:01.900
JUST A CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR

25:02.000 --> 25:03.400
ACTIONS BUT DID THEY MAKE A

25:03.466 --> 25:05.066
MINOR SLIP UP AT THE TIME DIDN'T

25:05.133 --> 25:06.200
FEEL LIKE IT AND SUDDENLY THEY

25:06.266 --> 25:07.733
ARE OUT OF A JOB.

25:07.800 --> 25:08.766
IT HAPPENED TO A

25:08.833 --> 25:10.566
"NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTER TODAY,

25:10.633 --> 25:11.066
HE GOT CANCELED.

25:11.133 --> 25:12.533
HE GOT FIRED FROM HIS JOB

25:12.600 --> 25:16.966
BECAUSE HE USED THE N-WORD IN

25:17.033 --> 25:18.800
THE CONTEXT OF TALKING ABOUT

25:18.866 --> 25:22.133
RACIST LANGUAGE, NOT AS A SLUR

25:22.200 --> 25:23.200
TOWARDS ANYBODY.

25:23.266 --> 25:24.866
ONE STRIKE AND YOU'RE OUT AND

25:24.933 --> 25:25.833
WHAT DOES EVERY SINGLE

25:25.900 --> 25:27.366
CONSERVATIVE ABOUT TWITTER SAY

25:27.433 --> 25:28.466
ABOUT THAT TODAY?

25:28.533 --> 25:29.666
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS CRAZY,

25:29.733 --> 25:32.300
THE LEFT IS CRAZY, THEY'VE GOT

25:32.366 --> 25:34.266
TO STOP IT AND THAT IS

25:34.333 --> 25:34.566
ATTRACTIVE.

25:34.633 --> 25:38.700
>> Bill: CANCELING LINCOLN.

25:38.766 --> 25:39.666
YOU'RE A MILLENNIAL, RIGHT?

25:39.733 --> 25:43.733
MOST OF THE PEOPLE I HANG OUT

25:43.800 --> 25:45.333
WITH NOW ARE MILLENNIALS

25:45.400 --> 25:46.366
ESPECIALLY IN THE PANDEMIC.

25:46.433 --> 25:48.300
>> DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

25:48.366 --> 25:49.266
>> Bill: I LOVE MY MILLENNIAL

25:49.333 --> 25:51.466
FRIENDS, I DO, THANK GOD FOR

25:51.533 --> 25:52.433
THEM BECAUSE THE PEOPLE MY AGE,

25:52.500 --> 25:54.033
THEY ARE AFRAID TO GO OUT I

25:54.100 --> 25:56.133
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK OF

25:56.200 --> 25:58.700
THEIR PROBLEM IS BUT THEY JUST

25:58.766 --> 26:00.366
DON'T HANG.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.066
THEY'RE MARRIED, THEY CAN'T KEEP

26:01.133 --> 26:05.100
UP WITH ME, WHAT CAN I SAY?

26:05.166 --> 26:05.866
HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

26:05.933 --> 26:09.066
BOOMERS AND MILLENNIALS.

26:09.133 --> 26:10.733
BOOMERS DON'T HAVE ISSUES WITH

26:10.800 --> 26:12.700
THEIR OWN GENERATION SO MUCH, MY

26:12.766 --> 26:14.233
MILLENNIAL FRIENDS ALL HAVE

26:14.300 --> 26:15.466
ISSUES WITH HER OWN GENERATION.

26:15.533 --> 26:18.166
THEY TALK ABOUT THEIR OWN

26:18.233 --> 26:18.766
GENERATION, MAYBE I'M WITH THE

26:18.833 --> 26:23.066
SANE ONES BUT -- I'M GUESSING

26:23.133 --> 26:26.100
THIS IS COMING FROM MILLENNIALS

26:26.166 --> 26:27.433
THAT THEY WOULD TAKE THE NAME

26:27.500 --> 26:28.266
LINCOLN OFF OF THE HIGH SCHOOL,

26:28.333 --> 26:32.366
WHAT IS IT WITH NOTHINGNESS GOOD

26:32.433 --> 26:35.100
ENOUGH ENOUGH FOR THEM?

26:35.166 --> 26:35.900
LINCOLN?

26:35.966 --> 26:37.666
LINCOLN IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR

26:37.733 --> 26:38.233
YOU?

26:38.300 --> 26:44.100
WHAT THE FUCK, WHY?

26:44.166 --> 26:44.533
[APPLAUSE]

26:44.600 --> 26:45.566
WHERE DOES THIS COME FROM?

26:45.633 --> 26:46.266
>> I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE

26:46.333 --> 26:51.766
THINGS HAPPENING.

26:51.833 --> 26:53.133
MATT'S GREAT POINT ABOUT ONE

26:53.200 --> 26:54.366
STRIKE, YOU'RE OUT.

26:54.433 --> 26:56.133
THAT HAS HISTORY IN THE WAY

26:56.200 --> 26:56.900
MILLENNIALS WERE RAISED.

26:56.966 --> 26:59.066
IN THE 1980s AND 90s, THAT

26:59.133 --> 27:00.533
WAS THE FIRST TIME PEOPLE WERE

27:00.600 --> 27:02.600
TALKING ABOUT THE BULLYING AS A

27:02.666 --> 27:05.266
PROBLEM IN SCHOOLS, SO YOU BEGAN

27:05.333 --> 27:06.733
TO HAVE THESE ZERO-TOLERANCE

27:06.800 --> 27:08.566
POLICIES IN SCHOOLS WHERE PEOPLE

27:08.633 --> 27:12.900
MY AGE GREW UP AND THOSE

27:12.966 --> 27:13.500
ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICIES MEANT

27:13.566 --> 27:15.166
THAT IF SOMEBODY CALLED SOME OF

27:15.233 --> 27:16.466
THE NAME ON THE PLAYGROUND OR

27:16.533 --> 27:20.300
GOT IN A FIGHT WHEN THEY WERE

27:20.366 --> 27:22.500
NINE OR PUSHED SOMEBODY OFF A

27:22.566 --> 27:24.733
SWING, THEY COULD GET SUSPENDED

27:24.800 --> 27:25.166
OR EXPELLED.

27:25.233 --> 27:27.233
ONE STRIKE, YOU'RE OUT.

27:27.300 --> 27:29.733
THAT'S WHAT ZERO-TOLERANCE MEAN

27:29.800 --> 27:31.233
MEANT.

27:31.300 --> 27:31.800
THIS IDEA THERE WOULD BE A

27:31.866 --> 27:35.233
DRACONIAN PUNISHMENT FOR THE

27:35.300 --> 27:36.433
SEEMINGLY INNOCUOUS THING IS

27:36.500 --> 27:37.433
SOMETHING THAT THE BOOMERS

27:37.500 --> 27:38.500
CREATED BECAUSE THEY WERE SO

27:38.566 --> 27:40.566
AFRAID OF THEIR KIDS BEING

27:40.633 --> 27:41.766
BULLIED IN SCHOOL BECAUSE HEAVEN

27:41.833 --> 27:46.266
FORBID THEIR PRECIOUS CHILDREN

27:46.333 --> 27:47.733
EVER HAVE A MINUTE OF

27:47.800 --> 27:48.033
DISCOMFORT.

27:48.100 --> 27:48.900
>> Bill: YOU'RE RIGHT, THEY

27:49.000 --> 27:52.633
RAISE THEIR KIDS WRONG.

27:52.700 --> 27:54.866
WAS IT REALLY BOOMERS WHO RAISED

27:54.933 --> 27:56.500
MILLENNIALS?

27:56.566 --> 27:58.466
WHY DOES GEN X -- WHY ARE THEY

27:58.533 --> 28:00.800
COMPLETELY -- THEY SLIDE ON THE

28:00.866 --> 28:02.733
WHOLE GENERATIONAL BATTLE.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.866
>> WE WERE SLACKERS ORIGINALLY.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.333
>> Bill: YOU HAD NO CHILDREN?

28:06.400 --> 28:08.966
>> WE DO HAVE CHILDREN AND WE

28:09.033 --> 28:11.300
SEE THIS EVERY SINGLE DAY,

28:11.366 --> 28:12.266
ESPECIALLY ITS REINFORCED BY

28:12.333 --> 28:14.566
SCHOOLS NONSTOP.

28:14.633 --> 28:18.433
WHAT THE EFFECT IS AS IT MAKES

28:18.500 --> 28:19.633
ALL PARENTS -- I LIVE IN

28:19.700 --> 28:23.633
BROOKLYN WHERE THEY VOTED 103%

28:23.700 --> 28:26.366
FOR JOE BIDEN PROBABLY BUT

28:26.433 --> 28:26.966
PARENTS ARE ALL AGGRESSIVELY

28:27.033 --> 28:28.600
ROLLING THEIR EYES OF THE

28:28.666 --> 28:30.933
NONSTOP MESSAGING THAT'S VERY,

28:31.000 --> 28:31.933
VERY SUPER WOKE AND POLITICALLY

28:32.000 --> 28:33.333
CORRECT BUT THEY DARE NOT SAY A

28:33.400 --> 28:35.333
WORD BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO

28:35.400 --> 28:36.600
BE TARRED AS BEING RACIST.

28:36.666 --> 28:39.700
IF THIS IS BEING USED IN SCHOOL

28:39.766 --> 28:40.600
OPENING CONTEXT.

28:40.666 --> 28:41.166
IN CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS,

28:41.233 --> 28:42.533
THEY SAY WE AREN'T GOING TO

28:42.600 --> 28:43.800
REOPEN THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE IT'S

28:43.866 --> 28:46.533
AN ARTIFACT OF WHITE SUPREMACY.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.100
IN CHICAGO, TEACHERS ARE NOT

28:47.166 --> 28:48.066
SHOWING UP TO WORK RIGHT NOW,

28:48.133 --> 28:50.166
THEY SAY THEY ARE DOING THIS

28:50.233 --> 28:52.566
BECAUSE THE REOPENING DRIVE IS

28:52.633 --> 28:54.200
AN ARTIFACT OF RACISM, SEXISM,

28:54.266 --> 28:54.700
MISOGYNY.

28:54.766 --> 28:56.066
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL

28:56.133 --> 28:57.600
BUT THERE ARE THESE WORDS THAT

28:57.666 --> 28:59.633
CAN BE USED AS A WEAPON TO COW

28:59.700 --> 29:01.833
PEOPLE INTO SILENCE AND THAT'S

29:01.900 --> 29:02.533
WHERE IT'S THE MOST PERNICIOUS.

29:02.600 --> 29:06.266
>> Bill: THAT IS SO TRUE.

29:06.333 --> 29:08.900
I WANT TO SAY THIS ABOUT

29:08.966 --> 29:09.733
PARENTS.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.300
I FEEL FOR PARENTS TODAY,

29:11.366 --> 29:11.966
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T RAISE YOUR KID

29:12.033 --> 29:15.633
IN A VACUUM.

29:15.700 --> 29:16.700
IF ALL THE OTHER KIDS ARE DOING

29:16.766 --> 29:18.333
IT, YOU CAN'T TELL YOUR KID YOU

29:18.400 --> 29:21.866
CAN'T HAVE A PHONE, I GET THAT.

29:21.933 --> 29:24.066
THEY ARE ALSO LITTLE FOR THEIR

29:24.133 --> 29:26.133
CHILDREN AND IT RUINS BOTH THEIR

29:26.200 --> 29:26.333
LIVES.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.100
IT RUINS THE KID AND IT RUINS

29:28.166 --> 29:30.233
THE PARENT.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.200
THAT'S ONE THING, THE OTHER

29:32.266 --> 29:36.433
THTHING I THINK HIS PHONES -- YR

29:36.500 --> 29:37.166
GENERATION, HOW OLD WERE YOU

29:37.233 --> 29:40.500
WHEN YOU FIRST HAD A PHONE?

29:40.566 --> 29:41.766
>> I WAS MAYBE 14.

29:41.833 --> 29:44.666
>> Bill: THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

29:44.733 --> 29:46.333
AND NOW THEY PROBABLY HAVE THEM

29:46.400 --> 29:47.600
AT TEN OR YOUNGER AND I THINK

29:47.666 --> 29:51.500
PHONES MAKE YOU A BAD PERSON, I

29:51.566 --> 29:52.633
DO.

29:52.700 --> 29:55.033
[APPLAUSE]

29:55.100 --> 29:56.433
THEY MAKE YOU SHADY.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.166
>> HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE PHONES?

29:58.233 --> 30:00.800
>> Bill: WE ALL DO BUT THEY

30:00.866 --> 30:01.833
MAKE YOU SHADY AND

30:01.900 --> 30:02.633
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE, THEY MAKE

30:02.700 --> 30:07.266
YOU FAKE, COWARDLY AND BULLYING.

30:07.333 --> 30:08.700
WHEN YOU'RE ANONYMOUS YOU COULD

30:08.766 --> 30:12.033
BE THE BIGGEST ASSHOLE YOU WANT.

30:12.100 --> 30:16.033
EVERYTHING IS NOT REAL WITH THE

30:16.100 --> 30:16.300
PHONE.

30:16.366 --> 30:18.933
THE FILTERS --

30:19.000 --> 30:21.633
>> THE PANDEMIC HAS GOOSED THAT

30:21.700 --> 30:22.966
NEGATIVE ASPECT BECAUSE WE

30:23.033 --> 30:24.033
HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND EACH OTHER.

30:24.100 --> 30:25.033
WHEN WE ARE IN A ROOM TOGETHER

30:25.100 --> 30:27.500
AND I'M SURE YOU FOUND US DOING

30:27.566 --> 30:28.600
YOUR SHOW REMOTE, YOU JUST CAN'T

30:28.666 --> 30:30.633
READ THE ROOM.

30:30.700 --> 30:33.166
YOU CAN'T ACT LIKE SO MUCH OF AN

30:33.233 --> 30:34.233
ASSHOLE, YOU CAN'T BECAUSE

30:34.300 --> 30:35.666
YOU'RE GOING TO GET IMMEDIATE

30:35.733 --> 30:36.333
NEGATIVE FEEDBACK, YOU'RE GOOD

30:36.400 --> 30:37.833
TO FEEL WEIRD ABOUT IT IN

30:37.900 --> 30:38.100
PERSON.

30:38.166 --> 30:40.033
IF THERE ARE GENERATIONS OF KIDS

30:40.100 --> 30:41.466
RIGHT NOW WHO HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

30:41.533 --> 30:42.900
TO SEE THEIR PEERS FOR A LONG

30:42.966 --> 30:45.466
TIME AND YOU HAVE THIS FLATTENIG

30:45.533 --> 30:46.200
OF DIGITAL COMMUNICATION AND

30:46.266 --> 30:47.700
THAT'S WHERE IT GETS BAD.

30:47.766 --> 30:48.666
I THINK ONCE PEOPLE START

30:48.733 --> 30:49.600
ACTUALLY SEEING EACH OTHER AND

30:49.666 --> 30:52.300
PICKING NITS OUT OF THEIR HAIR

30:52.366 --> 30:52.900
AND DOING THE NORMAL CHIMPANZEE

30:52.966 --> 30:54.833
STUFF WE DO WHEN WE ARE AROUND

30:54.900 --> 30:56.233
EACH OTHER, THEN WE ARE GOING TO

30:56.300 --> 31:00.200
STOP BEING SO FOCUSED ON THESE

31:00.266 --> 31:00.800
FLAT COMMUNICATIONS WHERE WE

31:00.866 --> 31:02.433
CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE ARE

31:02.500 --> 31:03.633
SAYING OR CHERRY PICK SOMETHING

31:03.700 --> 31:05.700
BAD THAT THEY DID AND TRY TO

31:05.766 --> 31:06.133
RUIN THEIR LIVES.

31:06.200 --> 31:14.266
>> THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS ALSO,

31:14.333 --> 31:15.033
EVERY TIME THERE'S A NEW

31:15.100 --> 31:16.533
TECHNOLOGY PEOPLE SAY THIS IS

31:16.600 --> 31:17.266
GOING TO RUIN THE KIDS.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.933
TV IS GOING TO RUIN THE KIDS,

31:20.000 --> 31:20.500
PEOPLE THOUGHT THE RADIO WAS

31:20.566 --> 31:22.900
GOING TO RUIN THE KIDS AND I

31:22.966 --> 31:23.200
DON'T KNOW.

31:23.266 --> 31:23.766
>> Bill: BUT THIS ONE REALLY

31:23.833 --> 31:26.333
IS.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.900
[LAUGHTER]

31:27.966 --> 31:31.300
I GET YOUR POINT AND IT'S TRUE.

31:31.366 --> 31:35.233
>> THE OLD GUY NEVER SAYS THAT.

31:35.300 --> 31:36.200
>> Bill: I ALWAYS ASKED THAT

31:36.266 --> 31:37.333
QUESTION, AM I HITTING THIS

31:37.400 --> 31:40.566
BECAUSE I'M 65 RIGHT NOW?

31:40.633 --> 31:42.100
I CHECKED MYSELF, I'M LOOKING AT

31:42.166 --> 31:43.533
THIS OBJECTIVELY, IT REALLY IS

31:43.600 --> 31:43.933
BAD.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.100
IT REALLY DOES MAKE YOU A

31:46.166 --> 31:46.666
COWARD, THAT PHONE.

31:46.733 --> 31:49.533
GHOSTING PEOPLE, HAVING NO

31:49.600 --> 31:51.166
ABILITY TO CONFRONT -- THAT'S

31:51.233 --> 31:53.666
NOT A GOOD THING.

31:53.733 --> 31:55.733
I READ SOMETHING WHERE 81% OF

31:55.800 --> 31:56.400
MILLENNIALS HAVE ANXIETY JUST TO

31:56.466 --> 31:59.333
MAKE A PHONE CALL, LET ALONE GET

31:59.400 --> 32:01.833
ONE WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHO IT

32:01.900 --> 32:03.900
IS.

32:03.966 --> 32:07.533
WE USED THE JUST GO "HELLO, WHO

32:07.600 --> 32:08.866
WAS IT?

32:08.933 --> 32:13.066
HIGH MATT, IT'S BILL MAHER, CAN

32:13.133 --> 32:14.800
I TALK TO MICHELLE?"

32:14.866 --> 32:16.766
>> KNOW WHEN YOU GET A PHONE

32:16.833 --> 32:18.700
CALL IT'S YOU THINK SOMEONE

32:18.766 --> 32:18.900
DIED.

32:18.966 --> 32:19.533
YOU THINK IT'S THE HOSPITAL

32:19.600 --> 32:21.733
GIVING YOU WITH THE PHONE CALL.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.500
I DON'T FOR GET BETTER OR WORSE,

32:23.566 --> 32:24.500
I JUST THINK IT'S DIFFERENT.

32:24.566 --> 32:26.166
ALL THE WAYS THAT PEOPLE

32:26.233 --> 32:27.600
COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER AND

32:27.666 --> 32:28.466
THEY HAVE CONFRONTATIONS AND

32:28.533 --> 32:30.300
THEY EXPERIENCED REJECTION AND

32:30.366 --> 32:31.566
HAVE ARGUMENTS, THEY DO IT

32:31.633 --> 32:33.966
THROUGH THE PHONE AND I

32:34.033 --> 32:35.066
CERTAINLY THINK YOU'RE TOTALLY

32:35.133 --> 32:37.500
RIGHT, THERE'S A LOT THAT IS

32:37.566 --> 32:38.166
LOST WITHIN PERSON COMMUNICATION

32:38.233 --> 32:39.266
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

32:39.333 --> 32:41.400
BEEN ESPECIALLY TRUE WITH

32:41.466 --> 32:42.233
CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

32:42.300 --> 32:44.033
CONSPIRACY THEORIES SPREAD TOO

32:44.100 --> 32:44.600
MUCH MORE EASILY IN DIGITAL

32:44.666 --> 32:50.633
COMMUNITIES THAN THEY DO IN REAL

32:50.700 --> 32:52.066
WORLD -- IN PERSON CONVERSATIONS

32:52.133 --> 32:52.766
BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING

32:52.833 --> 32:53.766
CRAZY AND THEY CAN SEE ON THE

32:53.833 --> 32:56.766
OTHER PERSON'S FACE "THAT'S

32:56.833 --> 33:00.000
NUTS."

33:00.066 --> 33:01.433
IRONICALLY, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

33:01.500 --> 33:04.066
MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO THAT ARE THE

33:04.133 --> 33:05.833
OLDER PEOPLE WHO DON'T ACTUALLY

33:05.900 --> 33:07.000
KNOW AND UNDERSTAND TECHNOLOGY

33:07.066 --> 33:09.200
THAT WELL AND AREN'T THAT

33:09.266 --> 33:10.200
AFFLUENT AND HOW INFORMATION

33:10.266 --> 33:12.233
MOVES ACROSS THE INTERNET.

33:12.300 --> 33:14.933
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE

33:15.000 --> 33:16.566
INTERNET IS RUINING SOCIETY TO

33:16.633 --> 33:18.233
SOME EXTENT, BUT ACTUALLY THE

33:18.300 --> 33:18.766
YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO GREW UP

33:18.833 --> 33:21.300
UNDERSTANDING IT AND USING IT

33:21.366 --> 33:23.533
ARE MORE EQUIPPED TO SERVE IT.

33:23.600 --> 33:24.800
>> Bill: IT ALSO MAKES THEM

33:24.866 --> 33:26.733
MORE EQUIPPED TO BE MORE

33:26.800 --> 33:28.700
SQUARELY.

33:28.766 --> 33:32.633
>> IT'S ALSO A CREATIVE TOOL.

33:32.700 --> 33:34.133
I HAVE A 12-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

33:34.200 --> 33:35.700
WHO DOES ALL KINDS OF CRAZY

33:35.766 --> 33:36.433
CREATIVE STUFF ON TICK TOCK,

33:36.500 --> 33:39.666
THAT'S A POSITIVE THING TOO.

33:39.733 --> 33:40.500
LIKE ALL NEW THINGS YOU HAVE TO

33:40.566 --> 33:43.666
FIGURE IT OUT AND MONITOR IT AND

33:43.733 --> 33:45.066
MAKE SURE PEOPLE EMERGE FROM

33:45.133 --> 33:46.600
THEIR ROOMS MORE THAN ONCE EVERY

33:46.666 --> 33:48.133
FOUR MONTHS BUT IT CAN BE A

33:48.200 --> 33:50.200
SOURCE OF CREATIVITY AND STAYING

33:50.266 --> 33:51.466
IN TOUCH WITH PEOPLE LIKE HER

33:51.533 --> 33:53.666
GRANDPARENTS FOR MANY THOUSANDS

33:53.733 --> 33:54.000
OF MILES AWAY.

33:54.066 --> 33:55.266

33:55.333 --> 33:56.533
WE HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT, WE

33:56.600 --> 33:57.200
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD TIME

33:57.266 --> 34:01.000
TO DO ONE OF OUR FAVORITE

34:01.066 --> 34:06.900
REFILLABLES CALLED I DON'T KNOW

34:06.966 --> 34:09.733
FOR A FACT, I JUST KNOW IT'S

34:09.800 --> 34:10.300
TRUE.

34:10.366 --> 34:12.166
THERE ARE THINGS IN THIS WORLD I

34:12.233 --> 34:13.900
FREELY ADMIT I DO NOT KNOW FOR A

34:13.966 --> 34:16.966
FACT, I JUST KNOW THEIR TRUE.

34:17.033 --> 34:18.100
I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT THAT

34:18.166 --> 34:19.500
KEITH RICHARDS GOT COVID AND

34:19.566 --> 34:21.866
DIDN'T CARE.

34:21.933 --> 34:26.233
I JUST KNOW IT'S TRUE.

34:26.300 --> 34:27.366
I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT THAT

34:27.433 --> 34:28.233
WHEN YOU THROW OUT CHEF

34:28.300 --> 34:30.733
BOYARDEE, THE RACOONS WHO EAT IT

34:30.800 --> 34:33.500
HATE THEMSELVES.

34:33.566 --> 34:33.966
I JUST KNOW IT'S TRUE.

34:34.033 --> 34:34.233
[LAUGHTER]

34:34.300 --> 34:35.466
[APPLAUSE]

34:35.533 --> 34:36.600
I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT THAT

34:36.666 --> 34:37.633
ARMIE HAMMER JOINED A DATING

34:37.700 --> 34:42.666
SITE CALLED EAT-HARMONY.

34:42.733 --> 34:43.733
[LAUGHTER]

34:43.800 --> 34:45.000
I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT THAT

34:45.066 --> 34:46.166
THERE ARE NOW A DOZEN GARAGE

34:46.233 --> 34:47.400
BANDS CALLED "JEWISH SPACE

34:47.466 --> 34:55.433
LASER."

34:55.500 --> 34:55.900
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

34:55.966 --> 34:56.933
I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT THAT

34:57.000 --> 34:58.133
MOST OF THE ANTI-WALL STREET

34:58.200 --> 34:58.766
GAMESTOP CRUSADERS WILL BE

34:58.833 --> 35:05.133
STOCKBROKERS IN 10 YEARS.

35:05.200 --> 35:05.900
[LAUGHTER]

35:05.966 --> 35:06.566
THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE, THAT'S NOT

35:06.633 --> 35:08.666
EVEN A JOKE.

35:08.733 --> 35:09.600
I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT THAT

35:09.666 --> 35:10.700
KOMBUCHA IS THE JAPANESE WORD

35:10.766 --> 35:14.200
FOR "POND WATER."

35:14.266 --> 35:14.466
[LAUGHTER]

35:14.533 --> 35:16.933
[APPLAUSE]

35:17.000 --> 35:18.366
IT'S OKAY.

35:18.433 --> 35:19.366
I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT THAT

35:19.433 --> 35:20.166
JUSTIN TRUDEAU MOONLIGHTS AS A

35:20.233 --> 35:24.766
TANTRIC YOGA INSTRUCTOR.

35:24.833 --> 35:25.033
[LAUGHTER]

35:25.100 --> 35:26.600
I FEEL THAT'S TRUE.

35:26.666 --> 35:27.966
I DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT SEARS

35:28.033 --> 35:29.000
AND JC PENNEY WILL MERGE INTO A

35:29.066 --> 35:34.500
MEGA-CHAIN CALLED "SUCK MART."

35:34.566 --> 35:40.233
I JUST KNOW IT'S TRUE.

35:40.300 --> 35:42.200
[LAUGHTER]

35:42.266 --> 35:42.833
I WAS POINTING A LITTLE FUN AT

35:42.900 --> 35:53.166
ARMY ARMIE HAMMER THERE, IT SEES

35:53.233 --> 35:53.900
FRIVOLOUS TO BRING HIM UP AND I

35:53.966 --> 35:55.533
THINK WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS

35:55.600 --> 35:58.166
WITH RELATION TO WHERE FEMINISM

35:58.233 --> 35:58.333
IS.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.266
APPARENTLY ARMIE HAMMER HAS A

36:00.333 --> 36:01.233
PREDILECTION TO TELL HIS DATES

36:01.300 --> 36:02.966
HE WANTS TO EAT THEM AND WHO

36:03.033 --> 36:05.266
WOULDN'T WANT TO BE EATEN BY

36:05.333 --> 36:11.133
AARMIE HAMMER, COME ON.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.033
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

36:12.100 --> 36:15.700
EXACTLY MY POINT, THANK YOU,

36:15.766 --> 36:17.700
HONEST WOMAN.

36:17.766 --> 36:18.733
THIS IS SOMETHING CALLED ETHICAL

36:18.800 --> 36:22.300
HUMAN CANNIBAL FETISHISM.

36:22.366 --> 36:23.700
NO ACTUAL WOMEN WERE EATING IN

36:23.766 --> 36:26.100
THE MAKING OF THIS MOVIE,

36:26.166 --> 36:26.633
THEY'RE JUST TALKING.

36:26.700 --> 36:27.466
THEY HAVE IS TEXT WHERE HE

36:27.533 --> 36:29.666
SAYING THINGS LIKE I WANT TO

36:29.733 --> 36:30.600
TAKE YOUR RIB OUT AND EAT IT

36:30.666 --> 36:33.800
WITH BARBECUE SAUCE.

36:33.866 --> 36:35.700
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS JUST THE

36:35.766 --> 36:40.000
SUBWAY STOP PAST I WANT TO SPANK

36:40.066 --> 36:46.100
YOU BUT WE ARE IN SUCH A PORN

36:46.166 --> 36:46.700
CENTRIC SOCIETY WHERE PEOPLE

36:46.766 --> 36:49.166
HAVE BEEN WATCHING SO MUCH

36:49.233 --> 36:51.233
HARD-CORE PORN THAT SPANKING

36:51.300 --> 36:52.066
DOESN'T REALLY CUT IT ANYMORE,

36:52.133 --> 36:53.200
NOW I WANT TO TAKE YOUR RIB OUT

36:53.266 --> 36:57.366
AND EAT PART OF YOU.

36:57.433 --> 36:59.433
MY POINT IS THE WOMEN WHO ARE

36:59.500 --> 37:01.933
OBJECTING TO THIS, WHO WENT OUT

37:02.000 --> 37:03.800
WITH ARMIE HAMMER WILLINGLY AND

37:03.866 --> 37:07.200
STAYED IN WILLINGLY, IT WASN'T

37:07.266 --> 37:09.633
PHYSICAL BAD STUFF HAPPENING, WE

37:09.700 --> 37:11.200
WOULDN'T HAVE A DISCUSSION, WE

37:11.266 --> 37:12.566
WOULD ALL AGREE THAT IS

37:12.633 --> 37:13.566
INTOLERABLE.

37:13.633 --> 37:15.266
BUT IF THERE IS NO PHYSICAL

37:15.333 --> 37:17.566
COERCION, WHY ISN'T THIS JUST

37:17.633 --> 37:19.966
FILED UNDER "THAT SEEMED LIKE A

37:20.033 --> 37:23.733
GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME TO LET

37:23.800 --> 37:24.700
ARMIE HAMMER EAT ME BUT IT

37:24.766 --> 37:27.866
REALLY WASN'T."

37:27.933 --> 37:29.533
IT SEEMS LIKE WE DON'T HAVE ANY

37:29.600 --> 37:30.800
OWNERSHIP ANY MORE OF OWN

37:30.866 --> 37:33.666
CHOICES.

37:33.733 --> 37:36.466
>> BUT THERE WAS SOME PHYSICAL

37:36.533 --> 37:36.800
STUFF, RIGHT?

37:36.866 --> 37:37.666
SOME OF THE WOMEN HAVE ALLEGED

37:37.733 --> 37:40.566
THAT THERE WAS SLAPPING AROUND,

37:40.633 --> 37:42.800
ONE WOMAN SAID HE CARVED HIS

37:42.866 --> 37:43.633
INITIALS INTO HER BODY.

37:43.700 --> 37:44.900
>> Bill: DID HE TIE HER DOWN

37:44.966 --> 37:47.266
AND DO THAT?

37:47.333 --> 37:50.100
>> I DON'T KNOW, IT'S A GOOD

37:50.166 --> 37:51.166
QUESTION.

37:51.233 --> 37:57.766
>> BARE WE SURE IT'S CONSENSUALS

37:57.833 --> 37:59.100
MIKE >> THEY AREN'T SAYING IT

37:59.166 --> 38:01.666
WASN'T, THEY ARE SAYING IT'S

38:01.733 --> 38:02.800
CREEPY WHICH I DON'T WANT TO

38:02.866 --> 38:05.600
INVITE HIM OVER FOR BARBECUE, IT

38:05.666 --> 38:08.066
DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT.

38:08.133 --> 38:09.966
I CLICKED ON THE LINK ABOUT THE

38:10.033 --> 38:12.200
CUTTING STUFF BECAUSE I THINK

38:12.266 --> 38:15.400
IT'S A WHOLE CULTURE, IT CREEPS

38:15.466 --> 38:16.533
ME OUT, IT'S WRONG AND I WAS

38:16.600 --> 38:20.300
EXPECTED TO BE HORRIFIED, IT'S A

38:20.366 --> 38:23.966
LITTLE BIT LETTER A DOWN HERE

38:24.033 --> 38:25.866
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A TATTOO GONE

38:25.933 --> 38:29.466
SLIGHTLY WRONG.

38:29.533 --> 38:30.100
THE PERSON WASN'T TRYING TO GET

38:30.166 --> 38:31.900
FREE WHEN THAT WAS DONE.

38:31.966 --> 38:33.933
SO WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT?

38:34.000 --> 38:35.233
AS AN OUTSIDER COME AS A

38:35.300 --> 38:37.300
SOCIETY, WHAT YOU DO WITH THOSE

38:37.366 --> 38:37.966
PEOPLE IN THAT MOMENT DECIDE IT

38:38.033 --> 38:40.600
WAS A GREAT IDEA TO GET A

38:40.666 --> 38:48.800
PENKNIFE AND CARVE ON LE A -- TE

38:48.866 --> 38:52.233
AREN'T LAWS FOR THAT.

38:52.300 --> 38:53.033
PRESS CHARGES WHEN SOMETHING IS

38:53.100 --> 38:54.500
NOT VOLUNTARY, PRESS CHARGES

38:54.566 --> 38:56.300
WHEN SOMEONE COMMITTED VIOLENCE

38:56.366 --> 38:57.266
AGAINST YOU, BUT THAT DOESN'T

38:57.333 --> 38:58.633
SEEM LIKE WHAT THIS IS.

38:58.700 --> 39:00.733
>> THIS IS EXACTLY ONE OF THE

39:00.800 --> 39:02.233
THINGS THAT I THINK IS HAPPENING

39:02.300 --> 39:03.066
NOW WHICH RELATES BACK TO THE

39:03.133 --> 39:04.433
SCHOOL THING.

39:04.500 --> 39:07.700
LIKE YOU SAID, WE HAVE A

39:07.766 --> 39:08.333
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT IF

39:08.400 --> 39:11.533
YOU STEAL A CANDY BAR AND YOU

39:11.600 --> 39:13.533
ROB TEN BANKS, YOU'RE GOING TO

39:13.600 --> 39:14.866
HAVE DIFFERENT PUNISHMENTS

39:14.933 --> 39:16.033
BECAUSE THOSE TWO THINGS ARE

39:16.100 --> 39:17.433
DIFFERENT CRIMES.

39:17.500 --> 39:18.933
NOW WE HAVE THIS CONCEPT OF

39:19.000 --> 39:24.566
SOCIAL JUSTICE WHICH I THINK

39:24.633 --> 39:26.000
#MeToo AND THE CONVERSATION OF

39:26.066 --> 39:26.633
FEMINISM AND CONSENT WOULD COME

39:26.700 --> 39:28.933
UNDER THIS UMBRELLA BUT THERE

39:29.000 --> 39:33.166
ISN'T A SYSTEM FOR EDUCATING THE

39:33.233 --> 39:34.633
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DISEASE I'M

39:34.700 --> 39:35.500
SORRY AND HARVEY WEINSTEIN.

39:35.566 --> 39:36.700
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN

39:36.766 --> 39:39.300
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT IS MEANT FOR

39:39.366 --> 39:41.633
VERY UNDERSTANDABLE REASONS ARE

39:41.700 --> 39:42.600
NOW TREMENDOUSLY ANXIOUS AND I

39:42.666 --> 39:43.900
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHY.

39:43.966 --> 39:46.633
THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

39:46.700 --> 39:47.833
ANXIETY THAT THEIR BEHAVIOR

39:47.900 --> 39:50.333
COULD GET THEM COMPLETELY

39:50.400 --> 39:52.666
SHUNNED FROM SOCIETY.

39:52.733 --> 39:55.933
GUESS WHAT?

39:56.000 --> 39:59.700
>> Bill: THAT'S A GOOD --

39:59.766 --> 40:04.266
>> WOMEN HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH

40:04.333 --> 40:04.966
THAT ANXIETY THAT THEIR

40:05.033 --> 40:06.100
SEXUALITY CAN RUIN THEIR LIFE

40:06.166 --> 40:08.266
FOR LITERALLY MILLENNIA.

40:08.333 --> 40:12.733
THE IDEA THAT SEX HAS

40:12.800 --> 40:13.866
CONSEQUENCES, OBVIOUSLY THE

40:13.933 --> 40:15.100
BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF

40:15.166 --> 40:18.466
GETTING PREGNANT BUT UNTIL,

40:18.533 --> 40:19.666
MAXIMUM, 70 YEARS AGO WOMEN

40:19.733 --> 40:21.066
COULD BE -- AND STILL IN SOME

40:21.133 --> 40:22.500
PARTS OF THE WORLD -- WOMEN

40:22.566 --> 40:24.600
COULD BE OSTRACIZED, MURDERED,

40:24.666 --> 40:25.433
TORTURED, FORCED INTO HORRIBLE

40:25.500 --> 40:27.400
MARRIAGE FOR TALKING TO THE

40:27.466 --> 40:29.400
WRONG PERSON, FOR HAVING SEX OUT

40:29.466 --> 40:31.033
OF WEDLOCK, FOR SHOWING THEIR

40:31.100 --> 40:32.833
ANKLES, ALL KINDS OF RIDICULOUS

40:32.900 --> 40:33.633
STUFF.

40:33.700 --> 40:34.900
THE IDEA THAT THERE IS NOW

40:34.966 --> 40:38.166
SUDDENLY CONSEQUENCES THAT MIGHT

40:38.233 --> 40:41.466
FEEL AND I AGREE ARE UNFAIR

40:41.533 --> 40:43.866
GIVEN THAT, YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S

40:43.933 --> 40:44.566
POSSIBLE THIS WAS CONSENSUAL.

40:44.633 --> 40:45.333
BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

40:45.400 --> 40:48.633
IT IN A BROADER CONTEXT OF WOMEN

40:48.700 --> 40:52.833
HAVE HAD TO PONDER THE

40:52.900 --> 40:54.233
EXTRAORDINARY CONSEQUENCES OF

40:54.300 --> 40:55.233
SEX FOR ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY AND

40:55.300 --> 40:57.700
NOW MEN ARE GETTING A TASTE OF

40:57.766 --> 40:57.966
IT.

40:58.033 --> 40:59.333
>> Bill: THAT IS ALL TRUE, I

40:59.400 --> 41:00.766
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT HAS TO DO

41:00.833 --> 41:01.400
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST YEAR

41:01.466 --> 41:04.566
WITH ARMY HAMMER.

41:04.633 --> 41:05.766
SHE'S NOT BEARING THAT WHOLE

41:05.833 --> 41:06.700
HISTORY ON HER SHOULDERS, SHE

41:06.766 --> 41:09.933
WAS BORN 25 YEARS AGO, SHE

41:10.033 --> 41:12.066
PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ALL

41:12.133 --> 41:14.033
THAT.

41:14.100 --> 41:17.666
>> I THINK WHAT I'M SAYING IS

41:17.733 --> 41:19.333
THAT IS IT SUCH A HUGE CRIME NOW

41:19.400 --> 41:23.400
THAT SOME MEN HAVE TO THINK

41:23.466 --> 41:25.366
ABOUT THE WAY THEY BEHAVE

41:25.433 --> 41:27.066
SEXUALLY AS IF IT COULD HAVE A

41:27.133 --> 41:28.833
TREMENDOUS UNFAIR CONSEQUENCES

41:28.900 --> 41:30.500
FOR THEM.

41:30.566 --> 41:34.733
>> Bill: IT'S NOT, WHEN IT

41:34.800 --> 41:36.233
FIRST HAPPENED I CALLED IT

41:36.300 --> 41:36.733
PLAYING WITH FIVE FOULS.

41:36.800 --> 41:40.366
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU FOLLOW

41:40.433 --> 41:41.833
BASKETBALL YOU'RE ALLOWED SIX

41:41.900 --> 41:42.833
VOWELS, IF YOU HAVE FIVE FOULS,

41:42.900 --> 41:43.500
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHO

41:43.566 --> 41:46.633
YOU'RE GOING TO FOUL.

41:46.700 --> 41:47.666
YOU'RE PLAYING WITH FIVE FILES,

41:47.733 --> 41:49.033
YOU CAN STAY IN THE GAME BUT YOU

41:49.100 --> 41:50.166
BETTER BE CAREFUL AND THAT WAS A

41:50.233 --> 41:51.666
GREAT THING THAT HAPPENED TO

41:51.733 --> 41:51.833
MEN.

41:51.900 --> 41:54.533
>> KIND OF IRONIC IN THIS

41:54.600 --> 41:55.033
CONVERSATION THAT WILT

41:55.100 --> 41:59.333
CHAMBERLAIN NEVER FOULED OUT.

41:59.400 --> 42:02.200
>> Bill: DIDN'T HE SAY HE HAD

42:02.266 --> 42:02.600
20,000 CONQUESTS?

42:02.666 --> 42:06.600
>> SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

42:06.666 --> 42:08.566
THE THING THAT IS HAPPENING NOW

42:08.633 --> 42:10.000
THAT I'M ALARMED OF AS PART OF

42:10.066 --> 42:13.166
THIS IS IN SOME PLACES LAWS ARE

42:13.233 --> 42:14.566
CHANGING.

42:14.633 --> 42:15.166
THEY CHANGED COLLEGE CAMPUS

42:15.233 --> 42:15.833
ADJUDICATION AND THEY CHANGED IT

42:15.900 --> 42:17.966
BACK UP BUT FOR ABOUT FOUR OR

42:18.033 --> 42:19.800
FIVE YEARS, YOU COULD EASILY

42:19.866 --> 42:21.966
JUST GET KICKED OUT OF YOUR

42:22.033 --> 42:23.833
COLLEGE TO ACCUSATIONS OF A

42:23.900 --> 42:24.866
SEXUAL ASSAULT ABOUT BEING ABLE

42:24.933 --> 42:26.900
TO DEFEND YOURSELF.

42:26.966 --> 42:28.166
THEY THROUGH DUE PROCESS OUT THE

42:28.233 --> 42:29.633
WINDOW IN THE NAME OF BELIEVING

42:29.700 --> 42:30.733
WOMEN MORE STRONGLY, I THINK

42:30.800 --> 42:33.466
THAT'S WRONG.

42:33.533 --> 42:34.100
IN NEW YORK, GOVERNOR CUOMO SAID

42:34.166 --> 42:37.466
WE NEED TO CLOSE SOMETHING

42:37.533 --> 42:38.566
CALLED THE INTOXICATION LOOPHOLE

42:38.633 --> 42:40.233
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT LAW SO THAT IF

42:40.300 --> 42:42.500
YOU GOT DRUNK ON PURPOSE AND

42:42.566 --> 42:43.400
THEN CONSENTED AND HAD SEX ON

42:43.466 --> 42:46.966
PURPOSE BUT THEN REGRETTED IT

42:47.033 --> 42:49.366
SOMETIME LATER, YOU COULD STILL

42:49.433 --> 42:50.966
CLASSIFY THIS AS A

42:51.033 --> 42:52.066
SEXUAL ASSAULT SAYING YOU COULD

42:52.133 --> 42:53.700
HAVE BEEN IN YOUR CAPACITY.

42:53.766 --> 42:56.000
I THINK DOWN THAT PATH IS WHERE

42:56.066 --> 42:57.600
INJUSTICE IS GOING TO LIE AND

42:57.666 --> 42:58.833
YOU'RE GOING TO GET GOVERNMENT

42:58.900 --> 43:00.566
INVOLVED IN HOW DRUNK WERE YOU?

43:00.633 --> 43:01.466
HOW MUCH DID YOU CONSENT AND

43:01.533 --> 43:04.600
THAT IS A SQUARELY PLACE TO BE.

43:04.666 --> 43:06.900
THE OTHER PLACE AND THE DISEASE

43:06.966 --> 43:15.666
ITO AZIZ EXAMPLE, YOU COULD GO N

43:15.733 --> 43:17.033
THE MEDIA, SHE'S LOOSE OR SHE'S

43:17.100 --> 43:22.700
A SLUT OR A WAY AND MEN THAT USO

43:22.766 --> 43:24.200
TALK ABOUT WOMEN IT IS TO BE

43:24.266 --> 43:26.133
TERRIBLE, YOU COULD HAVE YOUR

43:26.200 --> 43:26.966
POST FACT ALL REGRET DISCUSSION

43:27.033 --> 43:30.233
ABOUT A PERSON.

43:30.300 --> 43:31.400
MAYBE THAT IS WARNING FUTURE

43:31.466 --> 43:32.700
PARTNERS THAT HE IS GOING TO

43:32.766 --> 43:34.533
TALK ABOUT YOUR RIB IN A WAY

43:34.600 --> 43:35.766
THAT'S GOING TO BE UNSETTLING SO

43:35.833 --> 43:38.433
MAYBE THAT HAS

43:38.500 --> 43:39.866
USES BUT I KNOW THIS IS HAPPENED

43:39.933 --> 43:43.000
ACTUALLY HUMAN BEINGS IT HAS RUS

43:43.066 --> 43:45.233
THAT WEREN'T CLEAR.

43:45.300 --> 43:48.866
>> Bill: IN THAT CASE HAS MANY

43:48.933 --> 43:49.500
PEOPLE HAVE SAID, IT WAS JUST A

43:49.566 --> 43:51.166
BAD DATE, SHE HAD MANY

43:51.233 --> 43:53.133
OPPORTUNITIES TO LEAVE, HE IS

43:53.200 --> 43:55.533
5'4", HE DIDN'T DRAG HER TO HIS

43:55.600 --> 43:58.100
APARTMENT.

43:58.166 --> 43:59.533
>> I THINK YOU MADE A LOT OF

43:59.600 --> 44:00.366
GREAT POINTS AND I AGREE WITH

44:00.433 --> 44:02.266
ALL MOST EVERY THING YOU SAID.

44:02.333 --> 44:03.533
I THINK WHAT WE ARE TALKING

44:03.600 --> 44:08.366
ABOUT HERE IS THIS SPASM OF

44:08.433 --> 44:11.133
MORAL PURITY THAT HAS TAKEN ROOT

44:11.200 --> 44:13.333
OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS, RIGHT?

44:13.400 --> 44:14.800
GUESS WHAT ELSE HAS BEEN

44:14.866 --> 44:17.933
HAPPENING OVER THE LAST FIVE

44:18.000 --> 44:18.133
YEARS?

44:18.200 --> 44:18.600
DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN

44:18.666 --> 44:19.233
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

44:19.300 --> 44:23.433
>> Bill: AND GEN Z, IT'S

44:23.500 --> 44:23.766
GENERATIONAL.

44:23.833 --> 44:24.566
>> SURE.

44:24.633 --> 44:26.866
I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS

44:26.933 --> 44:27.533
DONALD TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT AND

44:27.600 --> 44:29.133
DONALD TRUMP GOT AWAY WITH

44:29.200 --> 44:30.500
EVERYTHING AND SO NOBODY ELSE

44:30.566 --> 44:33.466
COULD GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING.

44:33.533 --> 44:36.366
I THINK THERE WAS THIS CULTURAL

44:36.433 --> 44:39.866
AND SOCIETAL NEED TO PURGE

44:39.933 --> 44:40.800
OURSELVES OF ALL OF THE WRONGS

44:40.866 --> 44:44.566
THAT DONALD TRUMP SEEM TO EMBODY

44:44.633 --> 44:45.766
WHETHER THAT'S ASSAULTING WOMEN,

44:45.833 --> 44:46.466
WHETHER THAT'S RACISM, WHETHER

44:46.533 --> 44:52.433
THAT'S ANY NUMBER OF THINGS

44:52.500 --> 44:53.300
WHETHER IT'S ANYTHING WE'VE HAD

44:53.366 --> 44:56.000
THESE FEVER SPASMS ABOUT, I

44:56.066 --> 44:58.766
THINK THERE HAS BEEN A PUSH

44:58.833 --> 45:00.133
TOWARDS ACCOUNTABILITY AND IT'S

45:00.200 --> 45:02.233
BEEN BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN THIS

45:02.300 --> 45:04.500
BIG SYMBOL OF ALL THE WAYS IN

45:04.566 --> 45:06.466
WHICH THOSE THINGS ARE TOLERATED

45:06.533 --> 45:07.233
IN OUR SOCIETY.

45:07.300 --> 45:09.466
>> THEN I THINK IT BECOMES A

45:09.533 --> 45:12.066
SELF REINFORCING THING,

45:12.133 --> 45:13.100
ZERO-TOLERANCE AND SOMETIMES

45:13.166 --> 45:18.666
KIND OF INSANE SOUNDING, MOB

45:18.733 --> 45:27.500
JUSTICE METED OUT, SCREW THIS,

45:27.566 --> 45:28.700
SCREW THE PEOPLE DOING THAT, THE

45:28.766 --> 45:30.966
QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU GET OUT

45:31.033 --> 45:32.566
OF THAT CYCLE?

45:32.633 --> 45:33.800
FOR ME, GRANTED I COME FROM A

45:33.866 --> 45:35.866
CIVIL LIBERTARIAN POINT OF VIEW,

45:35.933 --> 45:38.033
YOU GET OUT THROUGH CIVIL

45:38.100 --> 45:38.600
LIBERTARIANISM, THROUGH DUE

45:38.666 --> 45:39.966
PROCESS AND BEING CAREFUL ABOUT

45:40.033 --> 45:41.300
THE WAY YOU TRACK DOWN THE BAD

45:41.366 --> 45:45.100
GUYS AND YOU MAKE THEM PUNISH.

45:45.166 --> 45:45.833
GO AFTER THE GUY COMMITTING THE

45:45.900 --> 45:47.933
CRIMES IN THIS CASE AND NOT

45:48.000 --> 45:49.800
PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT AS A WAY OF

45:49.866 --> 45:51.033
SYMBOLICALLY DEALING WITH YOUR

45:51.100 --> 45:51.800
FEELINGS ABOUT BATS.

45:51.866 --> 45:53.933
>> Bill: I MUST SAY ONE MORE

45:54.000 --> 45:55.700
THING ABOUT ARMIE HAMMER, I

45:55.766 --> 45:56.900
THINK HE'S EXACTLY THE GUY IN

45:56.966 --> 45:58.466
THE BOOK "FIFTY SHADES OF GREY"

45:58.533 --> 46:00.100
WHICH IS THE MOST POPULAR BOOK

46:00.166 --> 46:04.300
EVER WITH WOMEN.

46:04.366 --> 46:06.066
OPRAH SAID "I HOPE THE MOVIE IS

46:06.133 --> 46:08.666
FILTHY OR THAN BOOK."

46:08.733 --> 46:10.400
OPRAH SAID THAT.

46:10.466 --> 46:12.566
IF HE'S AS, HANDSOME MOVIE STAR

46:12.633 --> 46:18.900
GUY AND HE'S GOT A KINK.

46:18.966 --> 46:20.900
WOMEN SAID AT FIRST HE WOULD

46:20.966 --> 46:22.733
LOVE BOMB ME, IT WAS GREAT.

46:22.800 --> 46:24.333
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SWIM WITH THE

46:24.400 --> 46:25.200
ALPHA SHARKS, IT'S NOT GOING TO

46:25.266 --> 46:29.700
COME OUT WELL IN THE END.

46:29.766 --> 46:31.100
SHOULDN'T YOU KNOW THAT?

46:31.166 --> 46:32.566
IS THAT REALLY THAT HARD TO

46:32.633 --> 46:34.300
FIGURE OUT WITHOUT THE LAW

46:34.366 --> 46:34.733
GETTING INVOLVED?

46:34.800 --> 46:37.966
>> THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IS

46:38.033 --> 46:39.033
ARMIE HAMMER HASN'T BEEN UNDER A

46:39.100 --> 46:40.500
ROCK FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS,

46:40.566 --> 46:41.733
SHOULDN'T HE KNOW IF HE'S GOT A

46:41.800 --> 46:44.133
WEIRD KINK LIKE THIS, HE BETTER

46:44.200 --> 46:46.833
BE REALLY SURE THAT THE PERSON

46:46.900 --> 46:48.333
HE'S DEALING WITH IS SUPER ON

46:48.400 --> 46:50.833
BOARD WITH IT AND HAVE AMOUNT OF

46:50.900 --> 46:52.300
TRUST WITH THEM BUT THEY AREN'T

46:52.366 --> 46:53.900
GOING TO GO TO THE PRESS

46:53.966 --> 46:54.566
IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS?

46:54.633 --> 46:56.333
SHOULDN'T HE HAVE DATED THEM FOR

46:56.400 --> 46:56.633
A SECOND?

46:56.700 --> 46:58.266
>> Bill: HE DID DATE THEM,

46:58.333 --> 47:00.333
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.133
WHILE THEY WERE LOVE BOMBING HIM

47:03.200 --> 47:05.133
THE TATTOO WAS ALL GOOD AND THEN

47:05.200 --> 47:06.800
WHEN HE DUMPED THEM IT WAS NOT.

47:06.866 --> 47:09.166
>> ARE YOU GOING TO SIGN AN NDA?

47:09.233 --> 47:15.533
>> Bill: HE'S A C.A.D.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.400
>> LET'S SAY I'M ARMIE HAMMER

47:17.466 --> 47:18.533
AND I HAVE THIS PREDILECTION.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.866
I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT I'M WITH

47:20.933 --> 47:21.800
SOMEBODY THAT I REALLY TRUST,

47:21.866 --> 47:24.200
THAT I REALLY KNOW IS DEFINITELY

47:24.266 --> 47:24.466
ON BOARD.

47:24.533 --> 47:25.566
>> Bill: YOU THINK A GUY WHO

47:25.633 --> 47:27.300
WANTS TO EAT YOUR RIB CARES

47:27.366 --> 47:29.333
ABOUT THAT, HE DOESN'T CARES

47:29.400 --> 47:30.566
ABOUT TRUST, HE CARES ABOUT THE

47:30.633 --> 47:34.466
TASTE OF BLOOD IN HIS MOUTH.

47:34.533 --> 47:35.933
>> SPINAL TAP TAUGHT US WE

47:36.000 --> 47:37.733
SHOULD ALL THINK ABOUT THE

47:37.800 --> 47:38.366
MAJESTY OF ROCK AND THE MYSTERY

47:38.433 --> 47:40.433
OF ROLE AND THERE'S A WHOLE LOT

47:40.500 --> 47:42.100
OF MYSTERY OF ROLE WHEN IT COMES

47:42.166 --> 47:44.533
TO SEX AND WHAT TURNS PEOPLE ON

47:44.600 --> 47:48.333
AND NOT AND HOLY CRAP, WE DON'T

47:48.400 --> 47:50.000
WANT TO GET TO CLOSE IN THERE

47:50.066 --> 47:50.633
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

47:50.700 --> 47:51.533
EVERYONE IS SAFE ENOUGH

47:51.600 --> 47:55.200
COMMITTING CRIMES.

47:55.266 --> 48:00.066
>> Bill: THANK YOU, PANEL,

48:00.133 --> 48:03.766
TIME FOR NEW RULES.

48:03.833 --> 48:04.533
NEW RULE: NOW THAT D-LIST

48:04.600 --> 48:05.300
CELEBRITIES ARE RECORDING

48:05.366 --> 48:06.133
CELLPHONE MESSAGES FOR MONEY, WE

48:06.200 --> 48:06.900
SHOULD MAKE POLITICIANS DO IT

48:06.966 --> 48:07.666
TOO.

48:07.733 --> 48:08.566
"HI, TAMARA.

48:08.633 --> 48:09.300
IT'S YOUR BOY CHUCKY GRASSLEY

48:09.366 --> 48:10.100

48:10.800 --> 48:11.966
SISTER, YOU GOTTA DO IT UP

48:12.033 --> 48:12.700
RIGHT!

48:12.766 --> 48:14.600
PUT YOUR FOOT IN IT!

48:14.666 --> 48:15.333
ALSO ABORTION IS MURDER.

48:15.400 --> 48:20.366
THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT."

48:20.433 --> 48:22.200
[LAUGHTER]

48:22.266 --> 48:22.500
[APPLAUSE]

48:22.566 --> 48:24.133
NEW RULE: IT'S TIME TO

48:24.200 --> 48:25.633
OFFICIALLY RETIRE THE LINE, "OF

48:25.700 --> 48:26.700
COURSE IT RAINED, I JUST WASHED

48:26.766 --> 48:27.366
MY CAR!"

48:27.433 --> 48:28.700
THE LAST TIME THAT WAS FUNNY,

48:28.766 --> 48:29.433
THE CAR WAS A MODEL -T.

48:29.500 --> 48:30.800
AND THE PERSON WHO SAID IT WAS

48:30.866 --> 48:36.600
HENRY FORD.

48:36.666 --> 48:36.866
[LAUGHTER]

48:36.933 --> 48:37.500
AND HIS DAUGHTER WAS IN THE BACK

48:37.566 --> 48:37.833
[APPLAUSE]

48:37.900 --> 48:38.866
SEAT SAYING.'STOP IT, DAD,

48:38.933 --> 48:44.233
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME."

48:44.300 --> 48:44.500
[LAUGHTER]

48:44.566 --> 48:45.400
NEW RULE: SOCIOLOGISTS HAVE TO

48:45.466 --> 48:46.633
EXPLAIN HOW SMASHING FOOD IN A

48:46.700 --> 48:47.633
PERSON'S FACE WENT FROM BEING

48:47.700 --> 48:49.100
THE SIGN OF AN ABUSIVE

48:49.166 --> 48:50.333
RELATIONSHIP, TO A SYMBOL OF

48:50.400 --> 48:54.433
UNDYING ROMANTIC LOVE.

48:54.500 --> 48:55.433
WHEN PEOPLE ASK WHY I NEVER

48:55.500 --> 48:56.566
MARRIED, I TELL THEM, "I HAVE

48:56.633 --> 49:03.066
TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR CAKE."

49:03.133 --> 49:03.333
[LAUGHTER]

49:03.400 --> 49:04.466
[APPLAUSE]

49:04.533 --> 49:05.566
NEW RULE: SINCE SEX IS A REAL

49:05.633 --> 49:08.000
THING THAT HAPPENS IN REAL LIFE,

49:08.066 --> 49:09.200
EVERY PORN VIDEO SHOULD OPEN

49:09.266 --> 49:10.700
WITH THE WORDS: "BASED ON ACTUAL

49:10.766 --> 49:16.800
EVENTS."

49:16.866 --> 49:17.066
[LAUGHTER]

49:17.133 --> 49:18.200
THEN AT THE END, DO THAT THING

49:18.266 --> 49:19.300
WHERE WE'RE TOLD HOW THE LIVES

49:19.366 --> 49:20.500
OF THOSE DEPICTED IN THE FILM

49:20.566 --> 49:23.266
TURNED OUT.

49:23.333 --> 49:23.533
[LAUGHTER]

49:23.600 --> 49:24.800
"TAMMY WENT ON TO WORK IN A VAPE

49:24.866 --> 49:26.066
SHOP AND IS THE PROUD OWNER OF A

49:26.133 --> 49:30.500
LIZARD SHE STOLE FROM A PETTING

49:45.766 --> 49:48.200
[APPLAUSE]

49:48.266 --> 49:48.466
THANK YOU.

49:48.533 --> 49:49.566
NEW RULE: NOSTRADAMUS HAS TO

49:49.633 --> 49:50.966
ADMIT HE REALLY DROPPED THE BALL

49:51.033 --> 49:51.533
ON THE LAST 12 MONTHS.

49:51.600 --> 49:52.500
I MEAN, A LITTLE HEADS UP WOULD

49:52.566 --> 49:53.900
HAVE BEEN NICE.

49:53.966 --> 49:55.466
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

49:55.533 --> 49:57.166
PANDEMIC OR TRUMP TRYING TO END

49:57.233 --> 49:58.466
DEMOCRACY.

49:58.533 --> 49:59.466
I COULD HAVE BOUGHT GAME STOP AT

49:59.533 --> 50:05.266
12 BUCKS A SHARE!

50:05.333 --> 50:06.200
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

50:06.266 --> 50:08.200
AND FINALLY, NEW RULE.

50:08.266 --> 50:09.333
AS LONG AS WE'RE GOING TO THE

50:09.400 --> 50:10.900
TROUBLE OF ANOTHER IMPEACHMENT

50:10.966 --> 50:12.400
TRIAL, WE MIGHT AS WELL BE

50:12.466 --> 50:14.166
HONEST ABOUT WHAT IT'S REALLY

50:14.233 --> 50:15.733
ABOUT.

50:15.800 --> 50:17.900
THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 6TH WERE A

50:17.966 --> 50:19.700
FAITH-BASED INITIATIVE AND

50:19.766 --> 50:21.600
TRUMPISM IS A CHRISTIAN

50:21.666 --> 50:23.200
NATIONALIST MOVEMENT THAT

50:23.266 --> 50:24.700
BELIEVES TRUMP WAS LITERALLY

50:24.766 --> 50:26.800
SENT FROM HEAVEN TO SAVE THEM.

50:26.866 --> 50:27.733
IT'S RIGHT IN SENATOR TOMMY

50:27.800 --> 50:29.933
TUBERVILLE'S CAMPAIGN AD:

50:30.000 --> 50:31.833
>> GOD SENT US DONALD TRUMP.

50:31.900 --> 50:32.633
BECAUSE GOD KNEW WE WERE IN

50:32.700 --> 50:36.233
TROUBLE.

50:36.300 --> 50:36.500
[LAUGHTER]

50:36.566 --> 50:37.333
>> Bill: THERE'S A LOT OF TALK

50:37.400 --> 50:38.733
NOW IN LIBERAL QUARTERS ABOUT

50:38.800 --> 50:40.400
HOW REPUBLICANS SHOULD TELL

50:40.466 --> 50:41.700
THEIR BASE WHO STILL BELIEVE THE

50:41.766 --> 50:42.966
ELECTION WAS RIGGED THAT THEY

50:43.033 --> 50:43.966
NEED TO GROW UP AND MOVE ON AND

50:44.033 --> 50:46.500
STOP ASKING THE REST OF US TO

50:46.566 --> 50:50.000
RESPECT THEIR MASS DELUSION.

50:50.066 --> 50:51.200
AND, OF COURSE, IT IS A MASS

50:51.266 --> 50:53.000
DELUSION - BUT THE INCONVENIENT

50:53.066 --> 50:54.433
TRUTH HERE IS THAT IF YOU ACCORD

50:54.500 --> 50:55.533
RELIGIOUS FAITH THE KIND OF

50:55.600 --> 50:57.033
EXALTED RESPECT WE DO HERE IN

50:57.100 --> 50:58.666
AMERICA, YOU'VE ALREADY LOST THE

50:58.733 --> 50:59.800
ARGUMENT THAT MASS DELUSION IS

50:59.866 --> 51:05.633
BAD.

51:05.700 --> 51:08.133
[APPLAUSE]

51:08.200 --> 51:09.900
IT'S FUN TO LAUGH AT Q-ANON,

51:10.000 --> 51:11.433
WITH THE BABY-EATING LIZARD

51:11.500 --> 51:13.400
PEOPLE AND THE PEDOPHILE PIZZA

51:13.466 --> 51:14.700
PARLORS - BUT HAVE YOU EVER READ

51:14.766 --> 51:20.433
THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS?

51:20.500 --> 51:21.566
[APPLAUSE]

51:21.633 --> 51:23.466
THAT'S THE BIBLE - THAT'S YOUR

51:23.533 --> 51:25.100
HOLY BOOK, CHRISTIANS, AND

51:25.166 --> 51:26.400
THEY'VE GOT SEVEN-HEADED

51:26.466 --> 51:27.533
DRAGONS, AND LOCUSTS THAT HAVE

51:27.600 --> 51:28.500
THE FACE OF MEN AND THE TEETH OF

51:28.566 --> 51:30.000
LIONS.

51:30.066 --> 51:31.200
AND OTHER STUFF YOU ONLY SEE

51:31.266 --> 51:32.566
AFTER THE GUY IN THE PARK SELLS

51:32.633 --> 51:37.900
YOU BAD MUSHROOMS.

51:37.966 --> 51:38.200
[LAUGHTER]

51:38.266 --> 51:39.300
LAST WEEK, THE BIG STORY WAS

51:39.366 --> 51:39.566
[APPLAUSE]

51:39.633 --> 51:40.733
MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE BELIEVING

51:40.800 --> 51:43.333
IN JEWISH SPACE LASERS - WHICH

51:43.400 --> 51:44.333
ANSWERED THE QUESTION, WILL

51:44.400 --> 51:51.866
THERE BE COMEDY AFTER TRUMP.

51:51.933 --> 51:52.133
[LAUGHTER]

51:52.200 --> 51:52.966
[APPLAUSE]

51:53.033 --> 51:54.933
BUT REVELATIONS WILL TELL YOU

51:55.000 --> 51:56.533
EXACTLY WHERE THE WORLD ENDS -

51:56.600 --> 51:57.400
MEGGIDO, ISRAEL - I'VE BEEN

51:57.466 --> 52:03.600
THERE.

52:03.666 --> 52:04.400
[LAUGHTER]

52:04.466 --> 52:04.600
YEAH.

52:04.666 --> 52:05.700
THAT'S WHERE ALL THE ARMIES OF

52:05.766 --> 52:06.866
THE WORLD WILL GATHER AND JESUS

52:06.933 --> 52:08.100
WILL COME DOWN ON A FLYING

52:08.166 --> 52:09.733
HORSE, SHOOTING SWORDS OUT OF

52:09.800 --> 52:12.100
HIS MOUTH - JESUS, NOT THE HORSE

52:12.166 --> 52:14.166
- AND HAVE A THOUSAND-YEAR

52:14.233 --> 52:15.933
COSMIC "BOSS BATTLE" WITH SATAN,

52:16.000 --> 52:18.100
THE BEAST AND THE ANTI-CHRIST.

52:18.166 --> 52:19.500
IT'S LIKE TEN AVENGERS MOVIES

52:19.566 --> 52:20.800
PLUS TEN HOBBIT MOVIES TIMES A

52:20.866 --> 52:26.933
NIGHT OUT WITH JOHNNY DEPP.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.033
[LAUGHTER]

52:28.100 --> 52:29.400
[APPLAUSE]

52:29.466 --> 52:32.433
SPOILER ALERT, JESUS WINS.

52:32.500 --> 52:33.800
AFTER WHICH HE WILL RAPTURE UP

52:33.866 --> 52:37.400
ALL THE GOOD SOULS, PLUS 144,000

52:37.466 --> 52:40.300
JEWS WHO WERE GRANDFATHERED IN.

52:40.366 --> 52:43.666
BY OSKAR SCHINDLER.

52:43.733 --> 52:48.166
BUT SPACE LASERS!

52:48.233 --> 52:49.400
HA! MAGICAL RELIGIOUS THINKING

52:49.466 --> 52:50.933
IS A VIRUS, AND Q ANON IS JUST

52:51.000 --> 52:57.666
ITS CURRENT MUTATION.

52:57.733 --> 52:59.166
[APPLAUSE]

52:59.233 --> 53:00.500
THAT'S WHY MEGACHURCHES PLAY

53:00.566 --> 53:01.766
Q-ANON VIDEOS: IT'S THE SAME

53:01.833 --> 53:03.766
BASIC PLOT.

53:03.833 --> 53:04.866
Q IS A PROPHET, TRUMP IS THE

53:04.933 --> 53:06.866
MESSIAH.

53:06.933 --> 53:08.066
THERE'S AN APOCALYPTIC EVENT

53:08.133 --> 53:10.400
LOOMING, "THE STORM."

53:10.466 --> 53:13.666
THERE'S A TITANIC STRUGGLE OF

53:13.733 --> 53:16.766
GOOD VS. EVIL, AND IF YOU WANT

53:16.833 --> 53:25.533
GOOD TO WIN, JUST KEEP THOSE

53:25.600 --> 53:26.100
CHECKS COMING IN.

53:26.166 --> 53:27.233
WE NEED TO STOP PRETENDING

53:27.300 --> 53:28.066
THERE'S NO WAY WE'LL EVER

53:28.133 --> 53:29.000
UNDERSTAND WHY THE TRUMP MOB

53:29.066 --> 53:29.866
BELIEVES IN HIM.

53:29.933 --> 53:31.033
IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE RELIGIOUS.

53:31.100 --> 53:32.633
THEY'VE ALREADY MADE SPACE IN

53:32.700 --> 53:33.166
THEIR HEADS FOR SHIT THAT

53:33.233 --> 53:34.800
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

53:34.866 --> 53:35.400
WHEN YOU'RE A Q-ANON FANATIC,

53:35.466 --> 53:35.966
YOU'RE ALSO A FUNDAMENTALIST

53:36.033 --> 53:36.866
CHRISTIAN - THEY JUST GO

53:36.933 --> 53:38.133
TOGETHER, LIKE MACARONI AND

53:38.200 --> 53:39.233
CHEESE, OR CHARDONNAY AND

53:39.300 --> 53:43.066
VALIUM.

53:43.133 --> 53:44.600
[LAUGHTER]

53:44.666 --> 53:44.833
JUST ME?

53:44.900 --> 53:45.033
OKAY.

53:45.100 --> 53:46.133
THAT INSURRECTION LOOKED LIKE A

53:46.200 --> 53:47.200
REVIVAL MEETING WITH PEOPLE

53:47.266 --> 53:48.700
PRAYING AROUND WOODEN CROSSES,

53:48.766 --> 53:50.000
WAVING THE CHRISTIAN FLAG, AND

53:50.066 --> 53:52.266
"JESUS SAVES" SIGNS, YELLING

53:52.333 --> 53:54.800
"JESUS IS MY SAVIOR / TRUMP IS

53:54.866 --> 53:56.100
MY PRESIDENT."

53:56.166 --> 53:59.533
A JESUS 2020 BANNER HUNG NEAR

53:59.600 --> 54:00.900
THE GALLOWS THAT WAS ERECTED FOR

54:00.966 --> 54:02.433
MIKE PENCE.

54:02.500 --> 54:03.900
BECAUSE I GUESS HE'S JUDAS IN

54:03.966 --> 54:06.066
THIS VERSION OF THE STORY.

54:06.133 --> 54:07.300
WHICH MAKES THIS GUY PONTIUS

54:07.366 --> 54:10.700
PILATE?

54:10.766 --> 54:10.966
[LAUGHTER]

54:11.033 --> 54:12.966
IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT

54:13.033 --> 54:15.000
EVERY SENATOR WHO OBJECTED TO

54:15.066 --> 54:16.433
CERTIFYING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE

54:16.500 --> 54:17.466
VOTE IN ARIZONA IS AN

54:17.533 --> 54:19.400
EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN.

54:19.466 --> 54:21.066
WHEN TED CRUZ DEFENDED HIS VOTE

54:21.133 --> 54:22.533
TO OVERTURN A LEGITIMATE

54:22.600 --> 54:25.166
ELECTION, HE SAID: "RECENT

54:25.233 --> 54:26.700
POLLING SHOWS THAT 39% OF

54:26.766 --> 54:28.000
AMERICANS BELIEVE THE ELECTION

54:28.066 --> 54:28.833
THAT JUST OCCURRED.

54:28.900 --> 54:30.533
WAS RIGGED.

54:30.600 --> 54:31.400
YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH THAT

54:31.466 --> 54:32.500
ASSESSMENT.

54:32.566 --> 54:34.500
BUT IT IS NONETHELESS A REALITY

54:34.566 --> 54:36.900
FOR NEARLY HALF THE COUNTRY."

54:36.966 --> 54:38.200
IN OTHER WORDS, "WE HAVE NO

54:38.266 --> 54:39.766
PROOF THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN

54:39.833 --> 54:40.966
AND YOU MAY HAVE VERIFIABLE

54:41.033 --> 54:43.100
EVIDENCE THAT IT WASN'T, BUT

54:43.166 --> 54:44.633
THAT DOESN'T MATTER - IT ONLY

54:44.700 --> 54:48.266
MATTERS THAT WE BELIEVE IT."

54:48.333 --> 54:49.300
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE AT

54:49.366 --> 54:51.800
RELIGION.

54:51.866 --> 54:53.866
[APPLAUSE]

54:53.933 --> 54:55.466
THAT YOU HAVE TO RESPECT

54:55.533 --> 54:56.533
SOMETHING JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE

54:56.600 --> 54:58.300
BELIEVE IT.

54:58.366 --> 54:59.433
DOES THAT INCLUDE PROFESSIONAL

54:59.500 --> 55:03.133
WRESTLING?

55:03.200 --> 55:03.400
[LAUGHTER]

55:03.466 --> 55:05.100
THE FOUNDING FATHERS WERE PRETTY

55:05.166 --> 55:05.733
ADAMANT ABOUT BUILDING A NATION

55:05.800 --> 55:07.833
BASED ON REASON INSTEAD OF

55:07.900 --> 55:10.466
FAITH.

55:10.533 --> 55:11.566
THOMAS PAINE WROTE A WHOLE BOOK

55:11.633 --> 55:12.633
ABOUT IT, THE AGE OF REASON, AND

55:12.700 --> 55:14.133
IT WAS A BIG HIT; IT WAS THE

55:14.200 --> 55:16.966
WHITE FRAGILITY OF 1794.

55:17.033 --> 55:18.566
SO RESPECTFULLY, I DIRECT YOU TO

55:18.633 --> 55:20.733
YOUR OWN T-SHIRT: FUCK YOUR
