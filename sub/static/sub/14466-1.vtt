00:46.422 --> 00:48.966
- Yeah, hold on a second.
- What were you saying?

00:49.550 --> 00:52.344
- Taxi! Taxi!
- All right, what are you saying?

00:52.511 --> 00:54.972
I'm asking why you thought
you didn't have to be on time.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.645
Finally. God, come on.

01:13.157 --> 01:14.325
Sorry.

01:14.492 --> 01:15.659
Yeah. At last.

01:15.826 --> 01:18.245
Good. Great.

01:21.082 --> 01:25.711
Alex, cue three.
Sound, cue four and tabs, go.

01:32.676 --> 01:35.888
<i>Soul of the age</i>

01:36.180 --> 01:39.266
<i>The applause, delight</i>

01:39.433 --> 01:42.019
<i>The wonder of our stage</i>

01:42.186 --> 01:45.856
<i>Our Shakespeare, rise!</i>

01:46.357 --> 01:48.692
Our Shakespeare.

01:48.859 --> 01:52.029
For he is all of ours, is he not?

01:52.196 --> 01:54.448
The most performed playwright
of all time.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.701
The author of 37 plays,

01:57.868 --> 02:00.037
a hundred and fifty-four sonnets,

02:00.204 --> 02:03.541
and several narrative poems
that are collectively known

02:03.707 --> 02:08.670
as the ultimate expressions
of humanity in the English language.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.633
And yet...

02:14.218 --> 02:16.345
And yet,

02:17.221 --> 02:21.308
not a single manuscript
of any kind

02:21.475 --> 02:25.813
has ever been found
written in Shakespeare's own hand.

02:25.980 --> 02:29.150
In 400 years, not one document.

02:29.859 --> 02:32.570
He was born the son
of a glove maker,

02:32.736 --> 02:34.655
and at some unknown time, armed

02:36.991 --> 02:39.660
but with a grammar-school
education,

02:39.827 --> 02:41.495
he went to London,

02:41.662 --> 02:45.499
where, the story goes,
he became an actor,

02:45.666 --> 02:48.335
and, eventually, a playwright.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.965
He died at the age of 52.

02:53.132 --> 02:55.926
And he was survived by
his wife and two daughters,

02:56.093 --> 03:01.182
who, like Shakespeare's own father,
were irrefutably illiterate.

03:01.432 --> 03:05.019
His will famously left his
second-best bed to his widow.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.606
But it made no mention
of a single book

03:09.273 --> 03:11.108
or manuscript.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.028
Our Shakespeare

03:14.278 --> 03:17.615
is a cipher. A ghost.

03:18.324 --> 03:21.368
So let me offer you
a different story.

03:21.535 --> 03:26.123
A darker story,
of quills and swords.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.125
Of power and betrayal.

03:28.292 --> 03:33.088
Of a stage conquered
and a throne lost.

03:35.341 --> 03:37.718
After him!

03:47.728 --> 03:49.480
There he is!

03:50.439 --> 03:51.482
Get him!

03:54.193 --> 03:55.861
Over there!

03:56.820 --> 03:58.239
Hurry!

04:02.493 --> 04:05.246
- Break it down!
- Go, lads!

04:05.412 --> 04:06.914
Put your back into it!

04:18.968 --> 04:21.470
Search the place!

04:21.762 --> 04:23.013
Jonson!

04:23.180 --> 04:25.766
- Jonson!
- That way!

04:25.933 --> 04:28.352
I know you're in here!

04:28.519 --> 04:31.105
Jonson, show yourself!

04:31.522 --> 04:32.856
Come out!

04:33.357 --> 04:35.567
Out with you, Jonson!

04:35.734 --> 04:38.529
I'll smoke you out like a rat!

04:39.446 --> 04:41.407
- Torch it!
- Give it up!

04:42.408 --> 04:43.492
Torch it!

04:43.659 --> 04:44.910
Burn everything!

04:45.744 --> 04:49.123
Do you smell that, Jonson?

04:50.541 --> 04:54.795
That's the smell of your theater
going up in flames!

05:05.931 --> 05:07.808
Arrest him!

05:09.893 --> 05:11.312
Shall we to the Tower?

05:12.604 --> 05:15.274
Make way!
This is none of your concern!

05:37.171 --> 05:39.715
Chain him here, then leave us.

05:42.760 --> 05:47.473
He was carrying nothing
but a quill and some empty pages.

05:47.931 --> 05:52.603
You are Benjamin Jonson,
playwright.

05:52.770 --> 05:55.522
Son of William Jonson,
glassblower.

05:56.273 --> 05:57.524
Yeah.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.527
And have you ever
been arrested before, Mr. Jonson?

06:00.694 --> 06:05.115
I'm a writer, aren't I? Of course
I've bloody well been arrested.

06:08.035 --> 06:12.039
Ask him about the plays.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.208
Plays?

06:14.625 --> 06:19.171
Oh, which would you prefer,
Sir Robert Cecil? A pastoral?

06:19.338 --> 06:23.550
An historical? An historical pastoral?
An hysterical historical pastoral?

06:25.803 --> 06:29.390
We are not interested
in your plays, Mr. Jonson.

06:29.556 --> 06:33.018
We're interested in the plays
given to you by Edward de Vere,

06:33.185 --> 06:35.312
Earl of Oxford.

06:36.397 --> 06:39.525
Um... I am sorry, sir.

06:40.651 --> 06:43.904
I am not sure I know
whereof you speak.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.494
Where are the plays?

06:52.996 --> 06:53.997
What plays?

07:01.547 --> 07:03.006
Wonderful, isn't it?

07:03.173 --> 07:05.259
Well, it's certainly big.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.887
I promise you, Edward,
you've seen nothing like it!

07:09.054 --> 07:12.433
Mm. There won't be puppets,
will there?

07:13.517 --> 07:18.605
Step aside, step aside!
Make way for my Lords of Oxford and Southampton!

07:19.982 --> 07:23.777
And here come the fool
and the jester again, methinks.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.113
The stagecraft is
quite spectacular.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.991
Far more elaborate than
anything I've seen at court.

07:29.158 --> 07:32.411
Sheart,
what a damn'd witty rogue's this!

07:32.578 --> 07:34.955
How he confounds with his similes!

07:35.122 --> 07:37.416
Better with similes than smiles.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.836
And whither were you riding now,
signior?

07:42.337 --> 07:45.132
Whither should I ride
but to the court?

07:45.299 --> 07:46.967
Oh! Pardon me, sir.

07:47.134 --> 07:50.220
Thou never
saw'st my gray hobby yet.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.139
Have you such a one?

07:52.306 --> 07:54.141
No!

07:56.518 --> 07:57.811
Pbbt!

07:57.978 --> 08:00.063
Ha-ha-ha.
- Ale!

08:00.230 --> 08:02.274
Marlowe, spot me a few pence,
will you?

08:02.441 --> 08:04.568
<i>Henslowe owes me
for Shoemaker's Holiday.</i>

08:04.735 --> 08:07.488
That's because no one saw
Shoemaker's Holiday.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.655
Ale!

08:08.822 --> 08:11.992
Kit, isn't that one of your
unrequited loves in the box?

08:12.159 --> 08:14.661
The Earl of Southampton?
But with whom?

08:14.828 --> 08:17.998
By the beard, that's Edward
de Vere, the Earl of Oxford.

08:18.165 --> 08:21.293
Had his own acting troupe
for private court performances.

08:21.460 --> 08:25.005
I wonder if he needs any material.
Certainly not yours.

08:25.172 --> 08:30.010
What, the noble, there? Ha-ha.
Why, he's a gull! He's a fool! Aah!

08:30.969 --> 08:34.847
The poor man's
brain is lighter than his feather!

08:35.015 --> 08:36.933
Ha-ha-ha.
Enough!

08:43.190 --> 08:45.317
Jonson, wonderful dialogue.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.195
It's absolutely wonderful.
Shh.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.030
Oh. Ow!

08:50.197 --> 08:51.657
Sorry, sire.
Will.

08:51.823 --> 08:55.869
Will Shakespeare.
That is not ale in that goblet, is it?

08:56.036 --> 08:57.120
Ale?

08:57.621 --> 08:59.122
Me?

08:59.289 --> 09:03.126
Drink during a performance?
I am a professional, Mr. Henslowe.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.712
- Make way!
- Utter professional.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.340
Stand aside!

09:08.507 --> 09:11.051
- You stand aside!
- Watch yourself!

09:12.261 --> 09:16.265
This play has been
declared seditious

09:18.141 --> 09:20.894
by Lord William Cecil!

09:21.061 --> 09:23.897
Why don't you disperse
William Cecil's arse?

09:24.064 --> 09:25.649
Arrest that man!

09:25.816 --> 09:27.484
Disperse!

09:27.651 --> 09:29.695
This play is seditious

09:29.861 --> 09:32.155
and will not continue!
Seditious?

09:32.948 --> 09:36.285
It's a comedy!
There's nothing seditious about it!

09:36.451 --> 09:39.371
Is that right?
And you know this because...?

09:39.538 --> 09:41.582
Because I wrote
the bloody thing.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.959
Arrest this man as well!
What? No, wait...

09:44.126 --> 09:48.005
Please! I'm a poet, for God's sake!
I'm not a criminal!

09:48.171 --> 09:51.550
Thus endeth the brief career
of one Ben Jonson.

09:51.717 --> 09:52.759
Disperse!

09:52.926 --> 09:54.928
William Cecil, you're an arsehole!

09:55.095 --> 09:57.848
Well, off to Essex House, then.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.517
I'd like to see his arse dispersed!

10:00.684 --> 10:02.769
Disperse!

10:06.273 --> 10:10.777
Out. Henry, how many people
were at that play?

10:11.320 --> 10:12.362
I'm not sure.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.616
Two thousand? Maybe more.

10:15.782 --> 10:19.036
How many performances
are there of a play like that?

10:19.202 --> 10:21.288
Five or six, I suppose.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.457
New service.
By the beard.

10:23.624 --> 10:27.628
Ten thousand souls, all listening
to the writings, the ideas of one man.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.421
That's power, Essex.

10:29.588 --> 10:32.924
And if there's one thing the
Cecile understand, it's power.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.385
New service!

10:35.552 --> 10:39.765
And since when did words
ever win a kingdom?

10:41.350 --> 10:43.435
I'll keep my sword,
thank you very much.

10:47.439 --> 10:48.482
Out.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.988
Henry, some of my men have

10:55.155 --> 10:58.158
intercepted some of William Cecil's
correspondence

10:58.325 --> 11:00.911
with King James of Scotland.

11:01.370 --> 11:04.122
Cecil's all but promising him
the throne.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.375
To James?
Elizabeth would never...

11:06.541 --> 11:09.878
Elizabeth is old. III.

11:10.045 --> 11:12.172
And yet she refuses
to name an heir.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.675
But a Scotsman?
On the Tudor throne?

11:14.841 --> 11:18.011
That is why we must do
everything in our power to ensure

11:18.428 --> 11:20.972
the right man succeeds Elizabeth.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.600
A man deserving
of the Tudor crown.

11:26.144 --> 11:29.314
I ask you for the support
of you and your men, Henry,

11:29.481 --> 11:33.485
if it comes to a fight,
for me to seize the throne.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.737
You know you need not ask.

11:35.904 --> 11:38.657
I stand with you,
as I always have.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.960
Be careful, Henry.

11:50.127 --> 11:53.338
Always concerned for me.
What would you have me do?

11:53.505 --> 11:55.298
Deny him.
The son of the queen?

11:55.465 --> 11:57.384
That is rumor alone, Henry.

11:57.551 --> 11:58.969
Rumor?

11:59.136 --> 12:03.306
All you have to do is look at Essex
to see the queen's reflection.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.059
Everyone thinks he's her son.
My lords.

12:08.562 --> 12:09.563
And I, for one,

12:09.730 --> 12:13.984
would rather bow to a Tudor, bastard
though he may be, than a Scotsman.

12:14.151 --> 12:17.863
My only desire is to see
the next king be the rightful king.

12:18.029 --> 12:22.409
But what Essex contemplates
will lead to civil war. No.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.578
If this is to be done,

12:25.495 --> 12:28.039
it must be done carefully.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.171
Tie her off there.

12:36.131 --> 12:39.634
I agree, my lord.
My Lord of Southampton.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.096
Sir Robert Cecil.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.806
Have you seen Lord Essex?

12:44.973 --> 12:47.392
He is in the viewing chamber
with Her Majesty.

12:47.559 --> 12:48.685
Alone?

12:48.852 --> 12:52.105
With your father in London
dealing with troubles in Ireland,

12:52.272 --> 12:54.107
who else should the queen
turn to but Essex?

12:59.362 --> 13:03.325
By the grace of God,
Her Majesty, Elizabeth,

13:03.492 --> 13:07.871
Queen of England
Wales and Ireland.

13:09.414 --> 13:10.957
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.959
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.629
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.635
- Your Majesty.
- God bless Your Majesty.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.513
God bless Your Majesty.

13:26.765 --> 13:31.102
Ah. Your Majesty, my Lord of
Southampton has a gift for you.

13:31.728 --> 13:32.813
A gift?

13:33.230 --> 13:36.900
Yes, Your Grace.
Though not from me.

14:04.094 --> 14:08.265
Are you the gift,
my gracious little man?

14:08.431 --> 14:10.600
No, no, my most majestic Majesty.

14:10.767 --> 14:14.521
I am a free man. My gift is a play.

14:14.813 --> 14:15.981
A play?

14:16.147 --> 14:18.567
Plays are the work
of the devil,

14:18.733 --> 14:21.862
born from a cesspool of plague,
whoredom, thievery,

14:22.028 --> 14:24.906
fornication and heresy.

14:25.073 --> 14:28.368
Tell your master that Her Majesty...
Will gladly accept.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.705
That is, of course,
if Your Majesty so desires.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.039
Comedy or tragedy?

14:33.206 --> 14:36.209
Comedy, Majesty.
Comedy. By whom?

14:36.376 --> 14:39.588
By Anonymous, Your Majesty.

14:42.132 --> 14:44.217
Anonymous.

14:47.012 --> 14:51.725
I so admire his verse.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.604
Lead us to this play.

15:02.569 --> 15:06.072
♪ The woosel cock so black of hue ♪

15:06.239 --> 15:09.743
♪ With orange-tawny bill ♪

15:09.910 --> 15:11.244

15:12.996 --> 15:16.207

15:16.374 --> 15:19.169

15:22.339 --> 15:24.299
What angel

15:24.466 --> 15:27.344
wakes me from my flow'ry bed?

15:27.510 --> 15:31.473
♪ The finch, the sparrow and the lark ♪

15:31.640 --> 15:34.559
♪ The plain-song cuckoo gray ♪

15:34.726 --> 15:38.438
If we shadows have offended,
think but this and all is mended.

15:38.605 --> 15:43.068
That you have but slumber'd here
while these visions did appear.

15:43.568 --> 15:47.072
And this weak and idle theme,
no more yielding but a dream.

15:48.657 --> 15:53.244
Gentles, do not reprehend.
If you pardon, we will mend.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.747
So good night unto you all.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.124
Give me your hands,
if we be friends,

15:58.416 --> 16:01.044
and Robin shall restore amends.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.758
Wonderful, wonderful.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.594
Most wonderful.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.186
It was so funny.
She really loved the donkey.

16:18.353 --> 16:21.606
Edward, Edward,
when can we do it again?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.820
Ah. There he is.

16:26.987 --> 16:30.615
Your father tells me you wrote
this evening's play yourself.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.534
I did indeed, Your Majesty.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.911
You sport with me.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.665
Compose something.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.834
Now?
Yes, now.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.753
On what subject, Your Grace?

16:44.087 --> 16:45.922
On truth.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.926
For truth,

16:50.260 --> 16:51.928
is truth,

16:52.262 --> 16:54.889
though never so old,

16:55.056 --> 16:59.019
and time cannot make that false
which once was true.

16:59.769 --> 17:03.857
My Lord of Oxford,
it seems you have added a poet

17:04.023 --> 17:05.983
to your family's line of warriors.

17:06.151 --> 17:09.988
I am as accomplished with sword
and musket as I am in verse.

17:10.155 --> 17:11.196
Are you indeed?

17:11.364 --> 17:15.035
It is my only desire to be Your
Majesty's most trusted servant

17:15.201 --> 17:19.204
in matters both of war and state,
if you will but have me.

17:19.622 --> 17:23.542
Why, Lord Cecil, we may very well
have found your replacement.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.337
We hope not too soon,
Your Majesty.

17:26.503 --> 17:29.716
And what thought you
of our young lord's play, William?

17:31.134 --> 17:32.886
If plays are indeed

17:33.053 --> 17:38.725
such a sin, I pray that I do not find
my salvation until very late in life.

17:44.773 --> 17:45.815
Jonson!

17:46.399 --> 17:47.484
Benjamin Jonson!

17:51.905 --> 17:53.907
You have been released.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.247
Got powerful friends now,
don't you?

18:19.057 --> 18:20.558
Ship oars!

18:32.195 --> 18:34.948
Ahem. My lord.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.242
The Tudor rose.

18:38.243 --> 18:41.830
The most beautiful of flowers,
do you not think?

18:41.996 --> 18:45.959
I assume I owe my freedom to you.
That is true.

18:47.168 --> 18:48.628
And it was hard to come by.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.798
One does not cross
my father-in-law lightly.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.758
Lord William Cecil.

18:55.093 --> 18:58.805
I have the questionable distinction
to be married to his only daughter.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.477
It was helpful
when I wrote to your jailers

19:04.644 --> 19:07.730
to release you
in my father-in-law's name.

19:09.524 --> 19:12.110
My release was not
officially sanctioned?

19:12.277 --> 19:17.031
Don't be an idiot. Of course it wasn't.
But you are free, are you not?

19:22.453 --> 19:26.791
I enjoyed your little comedy, Jonson.
You have great potential.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.001
Thank you, my lord.

19:28.168 --> 19:31.045
But its politics did have
quite an effect on the Tower.

19:31.212 --> 19:34.507
My father-in-law's men
felt it quite seditious.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.385
Politics. My play has nothing
to do with politics.

19:37.552 --> 19:38.970
It's just a simple comedy.

19:39.137 --> 19:42.724
That showed your betters as fools
who would barely get food

19:42.891 --> 19:46.269
from plate to mouth without
the cleverness of their servants.

19:46.436 --> 19:50.273
All art is political, Jonson.
Otherwise, it would just be decoration.

19:50.440 --> 19:54.027
And all artists have something to say.
Otherwise, they'd make shoes.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.863
And you are not a cobbler,
are you, Jonson?

19:58.156 --> 19:59.866
Francesco?

20:04.204 --> 20:06.039
A play, my lord.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.374
One you shall stage Bankside.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.210
Stage?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.545
Under your name.

20:13.463 --> 20:14.714
My name, my lord?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.883
I can't very well
use my name, can I?

20:17.050 --> 20:18.718
I'm the 17th Earl of Oxford.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.971
The Lord Great Chamberlain
of England, Viscount Bolebec,

20:22.138 --> 20:25.225
Lord of Escales, Sanford
and Badlesmere, etc. No.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.603
I have a reputation to protect.

20:29.687 --> 20:33.942
In my world, one does not
write plays, Jonson.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.318
People like you do.

20:35.485 --> 20:36.778
Yes, my lord.

20:36.945 --> 20:40.990
My lord, you wrote an entire play.
I know how difficult that is.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.284
Not a play, Jonson.
I've written many.

20:43.451 --> 20:46.162
No doubt many more
than you yourself.

20:46.329 --> 20:50.583
A good number performed years ago,
others never seen by a living soul.

20:50.750 --> 20:55.088
And you want me
to put my name to this play?

20:55.255 --> 20:58.299
No, I mean you to put
your name to all of them.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.135
All of them?
Don't look at me

21:01.302 --> 21:03.680
like I just gutted your pet dog.

21:03.846 --> 21:05.848
I mean to make you
the most popular,

21:06.015 --> 21:09.727
and therefore most monetarily
successful playwright in London.

21:09.894 --> 21:12.272
I wish you Godspeed
and good morrow.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.442
My lord, I really...

21:16.776 --> 21:19.946
This is for your trouble,
Signor Jonson.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.614
And for your silence.

21:22.282 --> 21:26.911
If you break that silence, mm,
not so good for Signor Jonson.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.041
Tell me about this play.

21:33.042 --> 21:36.212
It was an anonymous gift.

21:37.463 --> 21:41.217
Essex insisted it be performed
just to spite me in front of court.

21:41.384 --> 21:43.636
Of course he did.
What was it about?

21:44.220 --> 21:46.973
Some nonsense about fairies
and cherubs.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.310
And dancing asses.

21:52.895 --> 21:56.941
Edward, our poet earl,
has returned to court.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.569
Father,

22:00.278 --> 22:02.155
it was just a play.

22:02.322 --> 22:05.283
Know how long it took to
banish them from her presence?

22:05.450 --> 22:09.370
She adores them!
And Edward knows it!

22:09.537 --> 22:13.916
Mark my words,
he has done this to spite us.

22:16.210 --> 22:21.174
Edward wishes to choose
the next king.

22:22.425 --> 22:24.677
Haven't you convinced
the Privy Council

22:24.844 --> 22:27.388
to crown James of Scotland
the next king?

22:27.805 --> 22:29.849
Nobody has a better claim.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.310
Except one of Elizabeth's bastards.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.188
You mean Essex.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.233
He despises us.

22:39.901 --> 22:43.696
We shall lose all of our royal
licenses, our property!

22:43.863 --> 22:46.949
I shall convince her
to send Essex to Ireland

22:47.116 --> 22:49.535
to quell the Catholic rebellion.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.372
Southampton will follow.

22:52.872 --> 22:57.835
And if God is watching, neither will return alive.
And if he is not...

23:16.521 --> 23:17.855
Robert!

23:21.025 --> 23:22.693
Robert, come here!

23:27.615 --> 23:29.242
I am sorry, my Lord of Oxford.

23:29.409 --> 23:31.911
My son prefers
the company of himself.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.915
May I present to you my wife,

23:36.082 --> 23:38.793
Lady Cecil,
and my daughter, Anne?

23:40.128 --> 23:42.046
I am sorry for your loss,
my lord.

23:42.213 --> 23:45.091
The realm lost a great man
with your father's death.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.927
We hope you will be happy
in our house.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.929
Are you going to
live here forever?

23:50.430 --> 23:53.599
No. Only until
I reach my maturity.

23:53.766 --> 23:57.437
Why?
Because the queen has bade it so.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.230
My lord, when we first met,

23:59.397 --> 24:02.275
you said you wished to
become a great man of state.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.944
The queen and I hope
to make that so.

24:05.111 --> 24:09.532
To that end, I have the honor
of introducing you to your tutors.

24:09.699 --> 24:13.453
From 7 to 8, you will be tutored
in French by Mr. Crane.

24:13.619 --> 24:14.704
My Lord of Oxford.

24:16.831 --> 24:19.250
Nine to 10 is Greek
with Mr. Simmons.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.589
Is that Homer?
No. Plato.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.885
- Then cosmography with Dr. Richards.
- My lord.

24:29.051 --> 24:32.054
Two to 3 is geography
and history.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.515
And 4 to 5, fencing.

24:34.682 --> 24:37.477
And, uh, composition?
Poetry?

24:37.643 --> 24:40.521
This is a Puritan home, my lord.

24:40.688 --> 24:43.941
We believe such activities
to be the worship of false idols,

24:44.108 --> 24:46.569
and therefore a sin
before the eyes of God.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.321
A sin?

24:48.529 --> 24:52.325
Surely there must be room for
beauty and art in life, my lord?

24:52.492 --> 24:55.495
Not in this household.

25:13.638 --> 25:15.640
You were losing anyway.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.850
I was also winning.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.521
Unh.
Really?

25:26.651 --> 25:29.820
I think we can assume
I've mastered the Punta Riversa.

25:29.987 --> 25:32.823
Now I think we should move on
to the Punta Sopramano.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.201
Perchance with that,
you will best me.

25:35.368 --> 25:36.994
Yes, my lord.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.662
Apple for you, sir? There we are.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.332
Was it any good?
How should I know?

26:23.499 --> 26:24.750
You haven't read it?

26:24.917 --> 26:26.919
<i>I promised I'd finish Eastward Ho.</i>

26:27.086 --> 26:30.756
He's a nobleman, you say?
Well, is he powerful, rich?

26:31.924 --> 26:35.344
Ooh. Then you have to
do it then, don't you?

26:38.222 --> 26:43.269
<i>Will, I came to London
to be a great and soaring poet.</i>

26:43.436 --> 26:46.606
To be the conscience of our times.
The soul of the age.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.441
To ch-change the world, not...

26:48.608 --> 26:50.526
Ch-change the world?
What, with rhyme?

26:50.693 --> 26:54.614
Yes. Why not? Why can't a man
change the world with words?

26:54.780 --> 26:59.285
<i>"I'll</i> make you the richest and most
popular playwright in London."

26:59.452 --> 27:03.164
Bollocks. I can do that myself,
thank you very much.

27:03.331 --> 27:04.457
He's an amateur.

27:04.624 --> 27:06.292
A complete and utter amateur.

27:06.459 --> 27:09.545
Last week, gardening.
This week, writing. Next, hawking.

27:09.712 --> 27:14.383
No. No, I won't do it. It would be
an affront against the Muses.

27:18.095 --> 27:21.057
How much money
did you say he gave you?

27:21.223 --> 27:23.142
You think my name can be bought?

27:23.309 --> 27:27.271
No, no, no, not at all. No.

27:27.438 --> 27:31.275
I think we should keep
your good name quite intact.

27:33.861 --> 27:38.199
King Philip of Spain sees the
current Catholic revolt in Ireland

27:38.366 --> 27:42.078
GS 8 weakness Of OUTS.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.872
A weakness to be exploited.

27:45.039 --> 27:46.082
Ireland?

27:46.457 --> 27:51.128
There are reports of his sending
financial aid, even troops.

27:51.796 --> 27:56.008
We must act quickly. We must replace
the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,

27:56.175 --> 27:59.345
and send additional troops...
Replace?

28:00.680 --> 28:03.474
With whom?
I would recommend

28:03.933 --> 28:05.893
his lordship,

28:06.936 --> 28:08.854
the Earl of Essex.

28:09.021 --> 28:13.526
No, that's impossible.
He cannot be spared.

28:13.693 --> 28:15.611
We value his counsel greatly.

28:15.778 --> 28:17.947
Essex's martial abilities are,

28:18.114 --> 28:21.659
in my opinion, the only antidote
to the plague of Spain.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.995
Essex could not, unfortunately,

28:25.162 --> 28:28.040
remain in the Privy Council
while he is in Ireland.

28:28.416 --> 28:30.876
And who would you advise
to replace him?

28:31.252 --> 28:33.587
Sir Robert Cecil.

28:33.921 --> 28:35.548
Your son?

28:35.715 --> 28:37.007
Yes.

28:37.174 --> 28:41.220
Though he is my own advisor first,
Your Majesty, my son second.

28:41.387 --> 28:44.014
Yes. Yes, yes.

28:47.309 --> 28:49.729
Ah. Very well. Send Essex

28:50.020 --> 28:51.689
to Ireland.

28:51.856 --> 28:54.650
And we will place Robert
on our Privy Council.

28:59.280 --> 29:03.075
I saw a play this last weekend,
William.

29:05.202 --> 29:06.537
It made me think of...

29:07.580 --> 29:10.583
many things long past.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.336
I'd like to see more of them.

29:18.048 --> 29:20.760
Has Edward been happy,

29:21.218 --> 29:22.762
William...

29:23.721 --> 29:25.097
with your daughter?

29:27.099 --> 29:29.101
Murdered?!

29:29.393 --> 29:31.812
By your own hand.
He was stealing my poems.

29:31.979 --> 29:34.231
He was doing my bidding!
Yours?

29:34.899 --> 29:39.445
Of course! As soon as Robert told me
you were ignoring my express orders...

29:39.612 --> 29:42.615
Robert? Robert told?
Enough!

29:43.282 --> 29:48.037
Thou shalt not worship false idols
in my household.

29:48.204 --> 29:52.208
Your everlasting soul
hangs in the balance, not poems.

29:52.374 --> 29:54.293
My poems are my soul.

29:55.753 --> 29:59.924
You have placed me
in a grave position, Edward.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.552
I cannot have
my reputation soiled

30:03.719 --> 30:07.056
by this regrettable lack
of control on your part.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.603
We can claim self-defense.

30:13.521 --> 30:16.106
He drew sword first.

30:16.482 --> 30:20.194
But there is something
I wish in return.

30:21.445 --> 30:25.407
My daughter is young
and impressionable.

30:25.574 --> 30:27.451
She has feelings
for you, Edward.

30:29.453 --> 30:32.456
It is to be expected,
living in such close quarters.

30:32.623 --> 30:36.335
Sir, for the last three years, you
have seized much of my inheritance.

30:36.502 --> 30:40.005
Hold your tongue, lest you make
a claim you cannot retract.

30:40.172 --> 30:44.051
I was legally reimbursed for your
education and living expenses.

30:44.218 --> 30:48.973
You suggest you be reimbursed the rest of
my estate through your daughter's bed.

30:49.139 --> 30:50.349
No.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.060
This is how I suggest

30:53.227 --> 30:56.814
we keep your noble head
from the executioner's block.

30:57.690 --> 31:02.194
... duly considering the causes
for which matrimony was ordained.

31:02.361 --> 31:05.281
One was the procreation
of children,

31:05.447 --> 31:09.493
to be brought up in the fear and
nurture of the Lord and faith of God.

31:09.660 --> 31:13.789
Secondly, for the mutual society,
health and comfort

31:13.956 --> 31:17.167
that the one ought to have
of the other in prosperity,

31:17.334 --> 31:20.546
into the which holiest state
these two persons

31:20.713 --> 31:23.299
here present
come now to be joined.

31:38.355 --> 31:40.399
<i>Henry the</i> Fifth, by...

31:42.526 --> 31:44.403
no one?
Why would any of you

31:44.570 --> 31:47.531
admit to trying to better me
in historical drama?

31:47.698 --> 31:50.534
Comedy, yes. Tragedy, perhaps.

31:51.785 --> 31:56.582
Ben, waiting to see how it's received
before you lay claim?

32:13.057 --> 32:15.851
O for a Muse of fire,

32:16.018 --> 32:19.396
that would ascend
the brightest heaven of invention,

32:19.897 --> 32:22.858
a kingdom for a stage,
princes to act,

32:23.025 --> 32:26.737
and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene!

32:26.904 --> 32:29.365
Then should the warlike Harry,
like himself,

32:29.531 --> 32:32.701
assume the port of Mars,
and at his heels

32:32.868 --> 32:34.787
should famine, sword,

32:34.954 --> 32:38.916
and fire crouch for employment.

32:39.083 --> 32:41.543
The flat unraised spirits

32:41.710 --> 32:46.131
that have dared
on this unworthy scaffold

32:46.298 --> 32:49.510
to bring forth
so great an object:

32:49.677 --> 32:54.390
Can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of France?

32:54.556 --> 32:57.935
Or may we cram
within this wooden O,

32:58.102 --> 32:59.937
the very casques that:

33:03.232 --> 33:07.236
<i>Suppose
within the girdle of these walls</i>

33:07.403 --> 33:10.739
are now confined
two mighty monarchies

33:10.906 --> 33:14.576
whose high, upreared
and abutting fronts,

33:14.743 --> 33:17.496
the perilous narrow ocean
parts asunder.

33:18.455 --> 33:20.165
Hyah! Make way!

33:20.332 --> 33:22.418
<i>Piece out our
imperfections with your thoughts.</i>

33:22.584 --> 33:25.004
<i>Into a thousand parts
divide one man</i>

33:25.170 --> 33:29.675
and make imaginary puissance.
Think when we talk of horses...

33:34.763 --> 33:38.350
that you see them,
printing their proud hoofs

33:39.852 --> 33:42.104
in the receiving earth.

33:42.604 --> 33:44.273
For 'tis

33:45.190 --> 33:47.026
your thoughts,

33:47.192 --> 33:52.114
your thoughts that now
must deck our kings.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.034
Make way!

33:58.287 --> 34:01.123
This story
shall the good man teach his son.

34:01.290 --> 34:04.126
And Crispin Crispian
shall ne'er go by,

34:04.334 --> 34:07.546
from this day
to the ending of the world,

34:07.713 --> 34:10.882
but we in it shall be remembered.

34:11.050 --> 34:14.594
We few, we happy few,

34:14.762 --> 34:18.014
we band of brothers.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.934
For he today that sheds
his blood with me,

34:21.101 --> 34:25.105
shall be my brother,
be he ne'er so vile,

34:25.272 --> 34:28.817
this day shall gentle his condition.

34:33.322 --> 34:37.284
And gentlemen in England
now a-bed,

34:37.451 --> 34:41.163
shall think themselves accursed
they were not here!

34:41.330 --> 34:46.210
And hold their manhoods cheap
whiles any speaks,

34:46.668 --> 34:51.507
that fought with us upon
Saint Crispin's Day!

34:58.097 --> 35:00.516
My sovereign lord,
bestow yourself with speed.

35:00.682 --> 35:02.935
The French are bravely
in their battles set

35:03.102 --> 35:05.354
and will with all expedience
charge on us!

35:05.521 --> 35:08.524
All things are ready,
if our minds be so!

35:08.690 --> 35:11.026
Perish the man whose mind
is backward now!

35:11.193 --> 35:12.820
You know your places.

35:13.946 --> 35:15.614
God be with you all!

35:25.833 --> 35:27.042
Francesco, do you see?!

35:29.294 --> 35:30.462
Do you see?!
Si, signor.

35:34.758 --> 35:35.843
Kill the Frenchmen!

35:36.009 --> 35:37.678
Death to the French!

35:40.931 --> 35:43.934
Down with the French!
Down with the French!

35:47.437 --> 35:48.939
Your sword!

35:49.439 --> 35:51.483
We'll follow you!

36:09.960 --> 36:11.295
Edward!

36:12.045 --> 36:14.381
William Cecil convinced
the queen

36:14.548 --> 36:17.134
that only Essex
can save Ireland from revolt.

36:17.301 --> 36:19.303
I've pledged to go with him.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.806
I, for one, wish to see this
anonymous colleague of ours.

36:24.474 --> 36:25.809
Playwright!

36:26.518 --> 36:27.811
<i>Playwright! Playwright!</i>

36:27.978 --> 36:30.355
<i>Playwright! Playwright! Playwright!</i>

36:37.571 --> 36:40.699
I ask for your blessing, Edward.
I cannot give it.

36:40.866 --> 36:44.286
If he is to be my king, it is
my duty to be with him in battle.

36:48.749 --> 36:50.209
Will?

36:56.298 --> 36:58.217
Sorry to disturb
your entertainment.

37:00.385 --> 37:01.678
Henry!

37:02.095 --> 37:05.390
Thank you. And it's all written
in verse. Thank you.

37:05.557 --> 37:06.808
Got it, got it, got it.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.936
It's just... It's just been...

37:09.144 --> 37:12.064
Phew. Only... I...

37:12.231 --> 37:15.317
I want to thank my actors,

37:16.109 --> 37:18.695
whose great, great acting

37:18.862 --> 37:22.699
has brought my words to life

37:23.450 --> 37:26.245
due to their
most wonderful acting.

37:26.453 --> 37:29.873
Um... And, uh, thank you!

37:42.469 --> 37:43.553
<i>An</i> actor!

37:43.720 --> 37:45.597
An actor, for God's sake!

37:45.764 --> 37:49.184
My lord, I thought that...
You presume to think on my behalf?

37:49.476 --> 37:52.688
My lord, your voice is
completely different from mine.

37:52.854 --> 37:57.067
Voice? You have no voice!
That's why I chose you!

38:04.658 --> 38:06.368
You, um...

38:07.244 --> 38:09.037
You at least kept my name
from him?

38:12.749 --> 38:15.377
And will continue to do so?

39:10.474 --> 39:13.352
A romantic tragedy.

39:13.977 --> 39:15.645
In iambic pentameter.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.318
All of it? Is that possible?

39:21.485 --> 39:23.236
Of course it is.

39:30.285 --> 39:31.828
My lord.

39:37.959 --> 39:39.211
Will Shakespeare.

39:41.171 --> 39:42.672
William...

39:42.839 --> 39:44.341
Shake“.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.468
Speare.

39:50.347 --> 39:52.099
My lady.

39:56.770 --> 40:00.190
Who was that man?
I've seen him here before.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.070
Edward.

40:05.237 --> 40:08.198
We must discuss
our daughter's dowry.

40:08.365 --> 40:10.033
Dowry?
She cannot marry

40:10.200 --> 40:13.870
without a dowry becoming to
the daughter of the Earl of Oxford.

40:14.037 --> 40:16.331
I can give her Brooke House
and 100 pounds.

40:16.498 --> 40:19.000
A hundred pounds, Father?
Mother?

40:19.167 --> 40:21.336
That is all we have to give
at the moment.

40:21.503 --> 40:22.546
Leave us, Bridget.

40:26.716 --> 40:28.927
Edward, our family

40:29.094 --> 40:31.763
is in financial ruins,
and you...

40:31.930 --> 40:33.640
You...

40:33.807 --> 40:36.017
play the flute while Rome burns.

40:36.184 --> 40:39.229
Nero fiddled whilst Rome burned.

40:39.896 --> 40:41.398
My God.

40:42.732 --> 40:44.109
You're...

40:44.484 --> 40:45.777
writing again.

40:46.361 --> 40:47.487
After you promised.

40:47.654 --> 40:50.449
Anne, you should have
seen them, the mob.

40:51.032 --> 40:53.785
They didn't sit there
like the reptilia of court,

40:53.952 --> 40:56.788
faces motionless,
fangs momentarily retracted.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.875
No! They climbed the stage!
They fought the French!

41:00.125 --> 41:02.794
Stop it! Stop this at once!

41:04.337 --> 41:06.590
Why must you write?

41:06.756 --> 41:10.177
Why must you continue
to humiliate my family?

41:13.013 --> 41:14.556
The voices, Anne.

41:16.016 --> 41:19.102
The voices, I can't stop them.
They come to me.

41:19.269 --> 41:22.772
When I sleep, when I wake, when
I sup. When I walk down the hall.

41:22.939 --> 41:27.110
The sweet longings of a maiden,
the surging ambitions of a courtier,

41:27.277 --> 41:30.489
the designs of a murderer,
the pleas of his victims.

41:30.655 --> 41:35.368
Only when I put their words,
their voices, to parchment

41:35.535 --> 41:37.662
are they cast loose, freed.

41:38.205 --> 41:40.415
Only then is my mind quieted.

41:42.125 --> 41:43.460
At peace.

41:46.004 --> 41:49.341
I would go mad
if I didn't write down the voices.

41:51.259 --> 41:53.178
Are you possessed?

41:53.929 --> 41:55.597
Maybe I am.

41:57.599 --> 41:59.100
<i>This is incredible, Ben.</i>

41:59.267 --> 42:01.394
The whole bloody thing
in verse.

42:01.561 --> 42:04.397
It's really not that difficult
if you try.

42:04.564 --> 42:06.441
Oh, and have you ever tried?

42:06.608 --> 42:08.985
Ahh. But soft!

42:09.152 --> 42:11.571
What light through
yonder window breaks?

42:12.072 --> 42:15.909
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

42:18.411 --> 42:21.248
I'll have little trouble
parting the legs of barmaids.

42:21.414 --> 42:23.124
You cannot play Romeo.

42:23.291 --> 42:26.044
What? Why not?
I'm perfect for the role.

42:26.211 --> 42:30.298
I will not let that oaf Spencer
have another go at one of my roles.

42:30.465 --> 42:34.302
Only Will Shakespeare can pump
the life into Romeo's veins.

42:34.469 --> 42:37.180
And his codpiece.
No, Ben.

42:37.347 --> 42:40.600
Ben, I'm an actor.
Every inch of me,

42:40.767 --> 42:43.895
right down to my very toes.
I want to...

42:44.062 --> 42:47.274
No, I crave to act.

42:47.440 --> 42:49.693
So bloody well act like a writer.

42:49.859 --> 42:52.112
And, for God's sake,
keep off the stage.

42:52.279 --> 42:54.072
Writers do not have time to act.

43:02.706 --> 43:06.710
What lady's that, which
doth enrich the hand of yonder knight?

43:06.876 --> 43:08.753
I know not, sir.

43:12.674 --> 43:16.678
O, she doth teach the torches
to burn bright.

43:17.596 --> 43:20.015
It seems she hangs upon
the cheek of night,

43:20.181 --> 43:23.435
like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear.

43:25.312 --> 43:28.607
Beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.

43:28.773 --> 43:32.569
So shows a snowy dove
trooping with crows,

43:32.736 --> 43:35.530
as yonder lady
o'er her fellows shows.

43:35.697 --> 43:38.408
The measure done,
I'll watch her place of stand,

43:38.575 --> 43:41.745
and, touching hers,
make blessed my rude hand.

43:42.704 --> 43:43.955
Hmph.

43:44.164 --> 43:48.251
Did my heart love till now?
Forswear it, sight!

43:49.169 --> 43:53.423
For I ne'er saw true beauty
till this night.

44:01.014 --> 44:02.140
My Lord of Oxford.

44:02.307 --> 44:04.309
- That's the Earl of Oxford.
- Majesty.

44:04.476 --> 44:06.686
Yes, and doesn't he look handsome?

44:06.853 --> 44:08.480
Most definitely.

44:09.397 --> 44:12.233
We very much liked
your play tonight.

44:12.567 --> 44:15.570
Your young King Henry
reminded us of you.

44:15.737 --> 44:17.322
Did he?

44:17.489 --> 44:19.491
Brash, yet brave.

44:20.241 --> 44:21.993
A boy and yet a man.

44:23.578 --> 44:25.455
Fair on the eyes.

44:26.581 --> 44:28.917
Fairer to the ear.

44:31.169 --> 44:34.506
We are glad of your return
from the continent.

44:34.673 --> 44:39.260
Two years is too long without
such excellent amusements.

44:50.271 --> 44:54.943
Had I known my absence would have
caused Your Grace so much longing,

44:55.110 --> 44:58.613
I would have returned
much, much sooner.

44:59.531 --> 45:03.868
Your wife must be pleased to have
you once more present at her side.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.870
It is but a small comfort to me.

45:06.037 --> 45:09.541
I am returned only under
my father-in-law's insistence.

45:19.801 --> 45:22.971
Cecil told me your match
was one of love.

45:23.138 --> 45:24.973
So he would wish.

45:28.226 --> 45:31.479
But how could one love the moon
after having seen the sun?

45:36.651 --> 45:41.156
Which country did you like
the best on your travels, my lord?

45:41.322 --> 45:42.699
Italy, Your Grace.

45:43.032 --> 45:47.412
Hmm. Italy. And why is that?

45:47.579 --> 45:49.414
The weather? Or the food?

45:49.581 --> 45:52.041
No, no. Their theater,

45:52.292 --> 45:54.544
which they call
la comedia dell'arte.

45:55.211 --> 45:56.546
And, of course,

45:57.213 --> 45:58.381
the women.

46:01.050 --> 46:03.011
The women?

46:03.178 --> 46:05.847
They were more, uh, clear...

46:08.057 --> 46:11.728
with their desires. When they
want something, they take it.

46:12.896 --> 46:15.398
They do not wait to be taken.

46:45.804 --> 46:47.972
I can't decide.

46:49.307 --> 46:52.811
Are you Prince Hal?

46:54.979 --> 46:56.648
Or Romeo?

47:02.946 --> 47:04.447
No.

47:06.199 --> 47:07.784
No.

47:08.451 --> 47:09.577
You're Puck.

47:10.036 --> 47:12.121
Puck?
Yes, Puck

47:15.625 --> 47:18.503
Puck would never fight for you
in the Netherlands.

47:20.046 --> 47:21.881
The Netherlands?

47:22.048 --> 47:23.550
Well, why not?

47:24.551 --> 47:28.388
It's an open secret you support
the rebels against Spain.

47:29.389 --> 47:32.475
You are commissioning Englishmen
to help fight their cause.

47:32.642 --> 47:34.519
Spain's loss is England's gain.

47:34.978 --> 47:38.022
Is this why you bedded me?
For a commission?

47:38.189 --> 47:40.859
No, no, it's just...
Leave me.

47:42.986 --> 47:47.907
How dare you? How dare you?
I command you to leave my presence!

47:51.619 --> 47:53.538
O mistress mine,

47:56.749 --> 47:58.835
where are you roaming?

48:01.045 --> 48:02.881
O, stay,

48:03.882 --> 48:05.216
and hear,

48:06.593 --> 48:08.720
your true love's coming.

48:10.388 --> 48:12.181
That can kiss,

48:12.348 --> 48:14.225
both high,

48:15.310 --> 48:16.728
and low.

48:18.396 --> 48:21.733
No further, pretty sweeting.

48:23.735 --> 48:26.738
Journeys end in lovers' meeting,

48:27.989 --> 48:30.658
every wise man's son doth know.

48:32.911 --> 48:34.412
What is love?

48:36.247 --> 48:37.999
'Tis not hereafter.

48:39.417 --> 48:43.421
Present mirth hath present laughter.

48:47.342 --> 48:49.594
What's to come is still unsure:

48:50.428 --> 48:53.640
In delay there lies no plenty.

48:53.806 --> 48:55.183
Then come,

48:57.101 --> 48:58.770
kiss me.

49:00.605 --> 49:02.607
Sweet and twenty.

49:05.109 --> 49:07.779
Youth's a stuff will not endure.

49:16.788 --> 49:19.290
You will stay in England,

49:19.791 --> 49:21.709
and in my chambers.

49:21.876 --> 49:23.503
<i>I could do it if I wanted to.</i>

49:23.670 --> 49:24.796
Do what?

49:24.963 --> 49:28.132
A play in bic... In bia...

49:29.050 --> 49:31.386
In iambic pentameter.
It's not that hard.

49:31.552 --> 49:33.179
Think so?
Have you ever tried?

49:33.346 --> 49:35.390
Of course not.
But I could if I wanted.

49:35.556 --> 49:37.976
Well, it wasn't all in verse.

49:38.142 --> 49:40.478
Ah. You see?
Even easier.

49:40.728 --> 49:44.816
Henslowe wants <i>Romeo</i>
to run for a fortnight. A fortnight!

49:44.983 --> 49:47.819
Innkeeper! Drinks for everybody!

49:49.195 --> 49:51.489
Innkeeper! Billy!

49:51.656 --> 49:52.907
A fortnight?

49:53.074 --> 49:55.159
The maids love
the romantic tragedies.

49:55.326 --> 49:57.996
Precisely why I avoid them.

49:58.162 --> 50:02.000
Oh, well, worry not. A one-trick pony.
He'll never do it again.

50:08.297 --> 50:10.967
How have
you made division of yourself?

50:11.384 --> 50:13.011
An apple, cleft in twain

50:13.177 --> 50:17.515
is not more twin than these
two creatures. Which is Sebastian?

50:17.682 --> 50:19.267
Most wonderful!

50:36.367 --> 50:37.493
Great Caesar...

50:37.660 --> 50:39.328
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?

50:39.495 --> 50:41.456
Speak, hands for me!

50:47.211 --> 50:50.882
Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.

50:51.049 --> 50:52.967
Tyranny is dead!

50:53.134 --> 50:55.386
Freedom, liberty,
and enfranchisement!

50:56.054 --> 50:58.306
- Death to tyranny!
- Freedom!

50:58.473 --> 51:01.684
Yes! Freedom! Freedom!

51:04.228 --> 51:06.314
Liberty!

51:09.067 --> 51:11.069
- He was Scottish, wasn't he?
- Yeah.

51:11.903 --> 51:15.406
Round about the cauldron go.

51:15.573 --> 51:18.910
In the poison'd entrails throw.

51:20.578 --> 51:22.747
Toad, that under cold stone,

51:22.914 --> 51:25.750
days and nights has thirty-one.

51:27.919 --> 51:32.423
Double, double, toil and trouble.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.425
Fire burn!

51:40.598 --> 51:42.683
Beware

51:43.226 --> 51:47.063
of entrance to a quarrel,
but being in,

51:47.230 --> 51:49.857
bear't that the opposed
may beware of thee.

51:51.484 --> 51:55.279
Give every man thine ear,
but few thy voice.

51:55.446 --> 52:00.284
Take each man's censure,
but reserve thy judgment.

52:00.952 --> 52:04.705
Costly thy habit
as thy purse can buy,

52:04.872 --> 52:07.583
but not express'd in fancy:

52:07.750 --> 52:10.253
Rich, not gaudy.

52:11.170 --> 52:14.465
For the apparel
oft proclaims the man.

52:14.632 --> 52:17.885
Come, come, and sit you down.
You shall not budge!

52:20.638 --> 52:22.807
You go not till I set you up a glass

52:22.974 --> 52:25.309
where you may see
the inmost part of you.

52:25.476 --> 52:27.436
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me?

52:27.603 --> 52:30.648
HelP, help, ho!
What, ho! Help!

52:30.815 --> 52:34.569
How now! A rat?
Dead, for a ducat, dead!

52:34.735 --> 52:36.362
- Ah!
- Oh!

52:45.037 --> 52:46.372
I am slain!

52:46.539 --> 52:47.957
O me, what hast thou done?

52:48.124 --> 52:50.877
Nay, I know not. Is it the king?

52:52.378 --> 52:56.924
Thou wretched, rash,
intruding fool, farewell!

52:57.091 --> 53:00.344
Not a day too soon for Cecil!

53:21.616 --> 53:23.951
To be, or not to be,

53:24.118 --> 53:25.953
that is the question.

53:29.040 --> 53:31.876
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind
to suffer,

53:32.043 --> 53:35.046
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

53:35.213 --> 53:38.507
or to take arms against
a sea of troubles,

53:38.674 --> 53:40.509
and by opposing end them.

53:43.137 --> 53:46.891
to sleep, no more,

53:48.142 --> 53:52.063
and by a sleep to say we end
the heart-ache,

53:52.647 --> 53:56.734
and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to.

53:56.901 --> 53:58.236
'Tis a consummation,

53:59.654 --> 54:02.156
devoutly to be wished.

54:02.323 --> 54:04.825
To die, to sleep,

54:05.576 --> 54:09.580
Ay, there's the rub.

54:10.164 --> 54:13.459
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come,

54:13.626 --> 54:18.172
when we have shuffled off
this mortal coil, must give us pause.

54:18.339 --> 54:24.053
There's the respect
that makes calamity of so long life.

55:18.482 --> 55:19.859
Ah!

55:31.329 --> 55:34.665
- Give it good heat.
- This hot enough?

55:48.512 --> 55:52.725
You're certain of this?
William Cecil was murdered.

55:52.892 --> 55:55.019
Not literally, of course.

55:55.353 --> 55:57.396
He was a character.

55:58.022 --> 56:00.358
Fictional character.

56:00.524 --> 56:04.862
But the metaphor was clear
for anyone to see. And see, they did.

56:05.029 --> 56:06.906
Will you shut it down?

56:07.948 --> 56:12.620
Your service to his lordship
is once again greatly appreciated.

56:12.787 --> 56:17.291
He butchered you! Not only in front
of court but the entire city as well!

56:17.458 --> 56:19.627
We must arrest
this Shakespeare and...

56:19.794 --> 56:22.129
No, Robert.

56:22.296 --> 56:25.424
If he really is as popular
as you say,

56:25.591 --> 56:27.718
we would only anger the mob.

56:27.885 --> 56:30.971
We cannot maintain authority
if we are laughingstocks!

56:31.138 --> 56:35.351
Our authority comes
from Elizabeth and from God.

56:36.143 --> 56:39.397
You must think
more deeply, Robert.

56:39.563 --> 56:43.234
You must compensate
for your malformations.

56:43.401 --> 56:47.571
You must compensate with
the gifts God did give you.

56:47.738 --> 56:50.825
With cunning. With ruthlessness.

56:53.411 --> 56:55.037
It's from

56:55.746 --> 56:59.500
King James of Scotland.

57:02.920 --> 57:07.299
James is aware of the queen's
affections for Essex

57:07.466 --> 57:11.095
and of the rumors of his birth,
and he is justly concerned.

57:11.846 --> 57:13.681
You will write to James.

57:13.931 --> 57:18.269
You will tell him that I am gravely ill,
but that all is in hand.

57:21.105 --> 57:23.441
And then tell him,

57:23.941 --> 57:29.029
Essex will not return
from Ireland alive.

57:30.781 --> 57:35.995
God does indeed require
our help in this matter.

57:36.871 --> 57:39.707
This is how kings are made,
my son.

57:40.708 --> 57:44.295
So it was with Elizabeth,
so it shall ever be.

57:45.296 --> 57:50.968
James will expect you to do the same
for him and he will reward you for it.

57:53.053 --> 57:54.805
But we must

57:54.972 --> 57:57.975
do one thing more.

58:00.644 --> 58:02.480
Like Essex,

58:03.147 --> 58:06.984
Edward must be removed.

58:07.568 --> 58:09.612
Edward?
You must bribe someone.

58:09.778 --> 58:11.906
His fencing master, perhaps.

58:12.072 --> 58:15.826
Promise him a fortune
if he kills him.

58:16.785 --> 58:18.704
I am with child.

58:18.871 --> 58:20.331
Are you certain?

58:20.498 --> 58:23.334
Two cycles have
passed, my lord.

58:23.501 --> 58:26.670
And I wish to marry him.
Marry him?

58:27.087 --> 58:30.007
Your Grace, he is already married.

58:30.174 --> 58:33.302
I can do what I want.

58:33.469 --> 58:35.179
Can you?

58:36.013 --> 58:39.308
Most of the Catholic princes
of Europe seek to topple you

58:39.475 --> 58:43.187
and end your Protestant reign.
All that stop them are the Channel

58:43.354 --> 58:46.982
and the hope they marry you
and end your realm by other means.

58:47.149 --> 58:49.026
I love him!

58:52.530 --> 58:56.283
Would you risk your throne
for him? Hm?

58:56.450 --> 58:58.369
Would you risk England for him?

59:00.454 --> 59:04.208
We must do as we have done before.
You must go on progress,

59:04.375 --> 59:08.170
somewhere isolated, accompanied
by only those whom you most trust.

59:08.546 --> 59:13.300
After the birth, I shall find a suitable
house for the child to be reared in.

59:14.051 --> 59:15.553
And Edward?

59:18.347 --> 59:20.349
He must never know.

59:28.899 --> 59:30.526
What have you done?

59:31.193 --> 59:32.528
I am praying.

59:32.695 --> 59:34.405
She will not see me!

59:34.572 --> 59:38.033
I've gone to her, she will not
receive me, and now she's gone!

59:38.200 --> 59:40.035
She is on progress.

59:40.244 --> 59:41.579
Where?

59:42.496 --> 59:44.206
Where did she go?

59:45.416 --> 59:46.792
What did you say to her?

59:46.959 --> 59:49.753
She does not ask my advice
on matters of the heart.

59:49.920 --> 59:52.089
If she did, she would not
have chosen you.

59:52.256 --> 59:54.425
You must've known
she would go elsewhere.

59:54.592 --> 59:57.428
You're neither the first
nor the last of her lovers!

59:58.429 --> 01:00:00.681
Go back to my daughter, Edward.

01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:05.853
She will accept you
with open arms.

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:09.940
Behave as your great title
demands you behave.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:13.068
Tend to your estates,
your investments.

01:00:14.445 --> 01:00:16.697
And make me a grandson.

01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.284
An heir.

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:37.593
It's difficult to write, is it not?

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.220
After something like Hamlet?

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:42.389
It eats at you.

01:00:42.765 --> 01:00:44.558
At your soul.

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:50.773
Why do you think Will
hasn't been arrested?

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:55.527
He murders a caricature
of old William Cecil himself,

01:00:55.694 --> 01:00:59.031
and still whores it all the way
to Westminster and back.

01:00:59.198 --> 01:01:03.160
Ahem. Perhaps they haven't noticed.
I made sure they did.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:06.664
You informed on one of your own?
To the Tower?

01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:08.957
Watch who you judge, Ben.

01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:13.671
We do what we have to to survive
and survive well in this life. All of us.

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:16.632
And Will is definitely
not one of us.

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:23.472
You know he's illiterate,
don't you?

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:27.601
Oh, he can read well enough.
How else could he learn his lines?

01:01:27.935 --> 01:01:32.356
But the man never actually
learned to form his letters.

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:35.484
<i>So who did write Hamlet?</i>

01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:38.445
A nobleman.

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:43.909
Yes, but which?
You know, don't you, Ben?

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:46.412
Careful, Kit.

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:49.540
You sound like one of your plays.

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:58.215
Ben! Tell me.
We can go to him together.

01:01:58.716 --> 01:02:00.050
Guarantee his anonymity.

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:03.011
For a price.

01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:07.808
You reported on me as well,
didn't you, Kit?

01:02:07.975 --> 01:02:09.727
Last year. For <i>Every</i> Man.

01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:13.522
That's why I was arrested.
Wasn't it?

01:02:13.981 --> 01:02:16.150
I had nothing to do with that.

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:19.069
Ben. I'll just go to Will.

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:22.906
And he'll tell me because he has
so much more to lose than you.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:27.411
And you'll profit nothing from it.

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:29.079
Nothing.

01:02:36.462 --> 01:02:38.672
Rebels have stripped
the northern borders.

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:44.094
Then we must march south
and take Cahir Castle.

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.765
My lord,
it is a well-defended fortress.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:49.308
Holy Mary, mother of God.

01:02:49.475 --> 01:02:52.936
A thousand men, maybe more.
We cannot attack such a force.

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:56.690
So, what would you have me do?
Spend the entire spring encamped?

01:02:58.066 --> 01:03:02.279
I am sent to Ireland to end
this infernal rebellion, not to idle...

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:03.614
Robert!

01:03:12.039 --> 01:03:14.082
Must have been a cutpurse.

01:03:14.249 --> 01:03:17.836
Nowhere is bloody safe
any more, I'll tell you that.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:19.463
What's happened?

01:03:19.797 --> 01:03:21.131
Dead body.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.468
Now my tooth hurts.

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:30.057
The stench. He's done.

01:03:31.934 --> 01:03:34.061
- It's that playwright.
- Kit Marlowe.

01:03:34.228 --> 01:03:36.313
It's not right.
No, it's not.

01:03:57.626 --> 01:03:59.002
What's going on, Beaulieu?

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:08.762
Stop it!

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:10.889
Beaulieu! Aah!

01:04:53.307 --> 01:04:56.727
Francesco.
He tried to kill me.

01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:01.356
The mighty Sampson!

01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:04.735
What a beast!
Have you seen his claws?

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:06.570
I need more money.

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:09.573
You already make more
than any playwright Bankside.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:14.828
I want to build my own theater.
One that properly, um, fits the scale of my work.

01:05:14.995 --> 01:05:16.914
A theater? For your work?

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.000
I've found someone
who will make me a coat of arms,

01:05:20.167 --> 01:05:22.753
and change the Stratford lists.
Impossible.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.880
Eight shillings on six dogs!

01:05:25.047 --> 01:05:27.591
I'll take that bet.
Eight shillings on the bear.

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:30.177
That's a terrible bet, Ben!

01:05:30.344 --> 01:05:34.348
Make do with what you've got, Will.
I won't be your beggar.

01:05:34.514 --> 01:05:38.602
Oh, no. This isn't a request, Ben.
I'll have more money.

01:05:38.769 --> 01:05:42.522
Or what? You'll slit my throat,
like you did Kit's?

01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:47.444
I know he went to you last night
and was planning to expose you

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:50.322
if you didn't agree to his terms.
You're mad.

01:05:50.489 --> 01:05:52.366
So terrifying!

01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:53.951
Be careful, Will.

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:58.080
Kill me off, you won't have any good
plays to act in after this is done.

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.082
I'll have my guineas, Ben.

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:01.458
One way or another,

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:06.755
I will have my guineas.
Unleash the dogs!

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:12.052
Go on, bear!

01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:18.767
Thank you. Drink up, Francesco.
Another one where that came from.

01:06:21.228 --> 01:06:22.813
Francesco?

01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:24.815
Two this time.

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:27.401
- When shall I return?
- In a fortnight.

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:44.918
Over there.

01:06:45.085 --> 01:06:47.671
Just pull in there.

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:49.506
- Listen.
- Yes, master.

01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:51.216
When you cut my roses,

01:06:51.383 --> 01:06:52.843
- be gentle.
- Yes, master.

01:06:55.137 --> 01:06:56.805
Yes, master.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:09.484
My lord.

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:17.075
So you are the famous
William Shakespeare

01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:20.037
whose labors I have so enjoyed.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.541
I am at your service, sir.

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:27.210
I need more money.
I beg your pardon?

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:30.881
My lord, my expenses
have enlarged.

01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:34.634
Aggrandized.
Since all this began.

01:07:34.885 --> 01:07:38.221
Aggrandized?
Yeah, aggrandized. And, um,

01:07:39.514 --> 01:07:44.227
if your lordship does not agree
to an increase in my fee,

01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:49.066
then I shall be forced
to make certain facts public.

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:52.194
Hey. Have you any idea
to whom you are speaking?

01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:55.697
I am addressing
the writer of Hamlet.

01:07:57.908 --> 01:08:01.244
And of Juliet and her Romeo.
Am I not?

01:08:02.162 --> 01:08:04.581
Out. Get out.

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:06.416
As you wish.

01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:10.253
My lord.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.051
Wait.

01:08:16.218 --> 01:08:17.385
How much?

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.430
Four hundred pounds.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:24.267
A year.

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:28.145
No, pay him.

01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:35.278
Come.

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:50.460
Is this wise?

01:08:51.211 --> 01:08:53.505
They have already tried
to kill you once.

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:55.340
Wisdom,

01:08:55.966 --> 01:09:01.138
Francesco, is a quality I have
unfortunately never possessed.

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:27.163
Edward? You know I will
have to leave court soon.

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:38.966
She will be furious
if she finds out about this.

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:40.676
She abandoned me.

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:42.845
She still loves you.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.265
No, she doesn't.

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:49.935
You don't know,

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:51.854
do you?

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:55.817
The queen,

01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:58.445
she had your child.

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:23.386
My Lady of Oxford, welcome home.

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:41.738
<i>I cannot be certain, Your Majesty,</i>

01:10:42.072 --> 01:10:44.032
when the relationship began.

01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:47.244
But sometime soon after
your return to court.

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:49.412
You are sure?

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:53.250
They have not
been very discreet.

01:10:56.086 --> 01:10:58.421
There is more, Your Majesty.

01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:04.678
The lady is pregnant.

01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:10.350
Arrest them.

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:13.937
Arrest them both.

01:11:19.651 --> 01:11:21.194
What is the meaning of this?

01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:23.446
Edward!
Unhand me! Bessie!

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:25.240
Edward!
Bessie!

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:26.866
Edward!

01:11:29.995 --> 01:11:31.621
Whoa.

01:11:39.546 --> 01:11:42.716
Your whore gave birth last week.

01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:51.725
The queen has decided
to release you.

01:11:52.726 --> 01:11:56.896
Time does indeed, it seems,
heal all wounds.

01:11:57.731 --> 01:11:59.858
Here are the conditions
for your release.

01:12:00.025 --> 01:12:03.903
One, you will not
acknowledge the child.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:06.698
Two, you will never see
the mother again.

01:12:06.865 --> 01:12:10.201
Three, you will avoid court
at all costs.

01:12:10.368 --> 01:12:13.288
Her Majesty would prefer
never to be reminded of you,

01:12:13.455 --> 01:12:16.124
in any way ever again.

01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:17.334
Banished.

01:12:17.584 --> 01:12:22.339
No, you have the freedom
of the kingdom, just not of the court.

01:12:22.589 --> 01:12:24.507
Those are her terms.
Here are mine.

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:28.303
Go back to my daughter.
Make some effort to make her happy.

01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:30.972
Finally act according
to your station in life

01:12:31.139 --> 01:12:35.226
and accept the responsibilities
of your great title.

01:12:39.773 --> 01:12:40.940
My lord?

01:12:41.358 --> 01:12:43.360
I, too, have a condition.

01:12:48.156 --> 01:12:50.700
I will go back to your daughter,

01:12:51.368 --> 01:12:53.370
if you tell me the name
of the child.

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:59.459
I do not think the whore
has named the bastard.

01:12:59.626 --> 01:13:00.877
No.

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:02.629
The other one.

01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:09.219
The other one?

01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:14.015
Who told you?

01:13:14.808 --> 01:13:16.976
I will go back to your daughter.

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:22.524
I will give you as many grandchildren
as she can bear, or I can remain here.

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:25.318
There is no record of the true birth

01:13:25.485 --> 01:13:29.989
nor any trail that leads back to you
or the queen. The foster parents

01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:32.742
never knew the truth
and both now are dead.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.744
The name.

01:13:36.496 --> 01:13:39.416
Make even a hint of this
to the child or anyone else,

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:42.627
and this agreement is void,
and I will see your head

01:13:42.794 --> 01:13:45.588
and the head of the boy
on the block!

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.175
So it's a boy.

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:55.598
Good. Sword up. Again.

01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:05.483
Keep it high.
Mind your knee. Straight.

01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:07.068
Hello.

01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:08.486
Hello.

01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:12.115
My lord.
I'm Edward, the Earl of Oxford.

01:14:12.532 --> 01:14:13.867
My lord.

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:16.119
They say
you're an earl as well.

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:18.705
I am the Earl of Southampton.

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:25.587
Well, then. We shall be earls
together, shall we not?

01:14:32.302 --> 01:14:37.307
In the sweat of thy face, shalt
thou eat bread till thou return to the earth,

01:14:37.474 --> 01:14:39.267
for from it wast thou taken,

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:45.398
because thou art dust,
and to dust thou shalt return.

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:53.615
<i>We wish to recall Essex.</i>

01:14:53.781 --> 01:14:58.328
We feel a terrible void
without your father.

01:14:58.495 --> 01:15:00.955
A wise decision, Your Majesty.

01:15:01.122 --> 01:15:04.584
It will give him an opportunity
to respond to these reports.

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:09.964
They say Essex is in peace
negotiations with Philip of Spain.

01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:12.300
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:15.345
And that Essex has promised Philip,

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:17.972
all of Catholic Ireland in return.

01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:20.517
In return for what?

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:24.812
Spain's support of Essex's claim
to the throne of England.

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:29.859
It is, as of yet, just rumor.

01:15:31.528 --> 01:15:33.863
Bring Essex back to London,
William.

01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:36.866
Robert, Majesty.

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:43.289
My father's death has been
a great loss for us all, Your Majesty.

01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:48.294
A curse on you, Robert Cecil!

01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:51.506
- Leave the people alone!
- Down with the hunchback!

01:15:56.386 --> 01:15:58.221
See that it's done.

01:16:07.564 --> 01:16:09.732
My lord. From the queen.
Mm.

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:32.380
It's Robert Cecil. He failed to kill you,
now he tries to kill your name.

01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:35.341
I must speak to her. Myself.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:38.052
We leave with the tide.

01:16:38.553 --> 01:16:41.097
Boys! My boys!

01:16:42.515 --> 01:16:45.268
I've got it. Oh.

01:16:45.435 --> 01:16:48.104
The herald just finished it
about an hour ago.

01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:50.523
What do you think?
It's quite colorful?

01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:53.693
Well, heh,
what in God's name is it?

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.862
My coat of arms. Ha.

01:16:56.029 --> 01:16:59.324
It cost a fortune, but you can
call me a gentleman now!

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:00.950
I can't quite
make out the motto.

01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:10.543
"Not Without..."
Right.

01:17:11.586 --> 01:17:12.629
Oh. Heh.

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:14.631
"Not without right"?

01:17:15.048 --> 01:17:16.466
You...

01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:19.010
You went to him, didn't you?

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:23.306
You lying knave. You went to him.
Can I get you a drink? Billy!

01:17:23.473 --> 01:17:25.475
Will isn't even a writer.

01:17:25.642 --> 01:17:27.644
He can't even...
Yeah, all right.

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:29.896
No, get... Unhand me!

01:17:30.063 --> 01:17:31.481
Here!

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:33.775
Here!

01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:35.985
A quill?

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:42.575
Write something for us.

01:17:42.742 --> 01:17:45.411
Amaze us with your verse.

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:47.747
Your wit.

01:17:47.914 --> 01:17:49.957
No? Well...

01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:53.419
Try astounding us with the letter E.

01:17:54.504 --> 01:17:56.422
Or an I?

01:17:57.256 --> 01:17:59.258
It's just a straight line.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.438
Well, you haven't got any ink.

01:18:44.512 --> 01:18:45.555
My lords...

01:18:45.722 --> 01:18:47.849
- Wait for me!
- Please, my lords!

01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:51.853
Your Majesty.

01:18:52.687 --> 01:18:54.188
Are you...? Uh...

01:18:56.733 --> 01:18:58.568
Get out. Get out.

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:00.903
Get out!
Get out!

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:11.414
He burst in! Armed.

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:17.587
Is it an uprising?
Is it a revolt?

01:19:17.754 --> 01:19:21.299
Shall I order his arrest, Majesty?
Yes, yes. No, no.

01:19:21.466 --> 01:19:24.302
I don't know. I don't know.

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:27.096
What does he want?

01:19:32.602 --> 01:19:34.312
Has he gone mad?

01:19:34.479 --> 01:19:35.772
No.

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:39.734
Unfortunately for us,
Your Majesty, he is quite sane.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:44.739
He simply believes
he is your royal equal.

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.762
Edward! Halt!

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:11.474
Edward, thank God you're here.

01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:16.145
Elizabeth has revoked
all of his royal licenses.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:20.775
Confiscated his property.
She believes every lie Cecil tells about him.

01:20:21.901 --> 01:20:25.154
Fight him in London
and you prove true

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:29.283
every rumor and every lie
Cecil has ever told.

01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:32.203
Then what do you suggest I do?!

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:35.498
Let myself be arrested?
No.

01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:38.459
No.

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:41.462
I will visit Elizabeth myself.

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:43.422
Alone.

01:20:44.423 --> 01:20:45.967
How?

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:49.846
Cecil will not let her see a letter
without reading it first.

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:52.098
I will not send a letter.

01:20:54.684 --> 01:20:56.853
I will send a book.

01:20:59.272 --> 01:21:00.606
She will call for me.

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:05.444
While I am with her, you will
come not with an army or swords,

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.363
but with her loyal subjects.

01:21:09.115 --> 01:21:11.993
The tinkers, the cobblers,
the bricklayers of London.

01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:14.996
A mob. All of them, all of them,

01:21:15.162 --> 01:21:19.208
calling for Robert Cecil to be
banished from the court.

01:21:22.128 --> 01:21:23.462
Words.

01:21:25.631 --> 01:21:29.719
Words will prevail with Elizabeth.

01:21:30.469 --> 01:21:31.804
Not swords.

01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:34.724
And how do you suggest
I raise this mob?

01:21:35.474 --> 01:21:37.643
Leave that to me.

01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:03.586
<i>Oh, Will, Will!</i>

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:09.508
Aah! Hey!

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:12.011
Hold your tongue,
putana, and get out.

01:22:12.178 --> 01:22:13.638
Out.

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:16.641
Who's gonna pay me, then?

01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:22.563
What's all this about?

01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:28.611
Begin rehearsals immediately.
It must not be performed until I tell you,

01:22:28.778 --> 01:22:31.113
and you may only have
a day's notice.

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:35.910
Well, that will be expensive,
keeping all the actors ready,

01:22:36.077 --> 01:22:38.412
and having props made cheaply.
All right.

01:22:39.789 --> 01:22:41.624
Oh, and congratulations.

01:22:44.085 --> 01:22:46.295
You've had a poem
published today.

01:22:46.796 --> 01:22:48.464
Uh... Pub... Published?

01:22:48.923 --> 01:22:51.467
What, do you mean like in a book?

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:02.144
<i>She trembles at his tale</i>

01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:07.650
<i>- And on his neck</i>-

01:23:07.817 --> 01:23:11.320
<i>She sinketh down
Still hanging by his neck</i>

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:14.115
<i>He on her belly falls</i>

01:23:14.281 --> 01:23:17.660
<i>She on her back.</i>

01:23:18.119 --> 01:23:19.829
Ooh. I like this.

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:25.334
<i>'Fondling, ' she saith, 'I'll be a park
And thou shalt be my deer</i>

01:23:25.501 --> 01:23:27.670
<i>Feed where thou wilt...</i> 'Aww

01:23:27.837 --> 01:23:31.340
<i>Seeds spring from
seeds And beauty breedeth beauty</i>

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:33.342
<i>Thou wast begot</i>

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:35.970
<i>To beget is thy duty.</i>

01:23:36.137 --> 01:23:40.266
<i>Bylaw of nature
Thou art bound to breed...</i>

01:23:56.073 --> 01:23:57.700
Majesty.

01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:02.538
How do you find me?

01:24:04.290 --> 01:24:05.624
You...

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:09.795
You are the sun, Majesty.

01:24:11.172 --> 01:24:13.382
The glory...
Liar

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:18.137
It is hard to believe
that once I was young.

01:24:19.138 --> 01:24:21.432
I was beautiful.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.810
Your father knew me as such.

01:24:26.854 --> 01:24:28.397
Have you read

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:30.232
the book?

01:24:31.901 --> 01:24:33.402
He writes to me.

01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:37.406
To remind me of that beauty.
That love.

01:24:38.908 --> 01:24:42.411
How I took him.
How I adored him.

01:24:44.747 --> 01:24:47.583
Did your father tell you
of the child?

01:24:49.877 --> 01:24:52.046
Which one, Your Majesty?

01:24:53.089 --> 01:24:55.091
Edward's and mine.

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:58.094
He still lives?

01:25:00.930 --> 01:25:03.599
Is he well placed? A nobleman?

01:25:04.558 --> 01:25:07.061
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:25:07.228 --> 01:25:08.813
Who?

01:25:09.396 --> 01:25:12.983
I am your queen. Who is my son?

01:25:14.401 --> 01:25:17.738
The Earl of Southampton,
Your Majesty.

01:25:20.074 --> 01:25:23.452
Majesty, you are not having doubts
about James of Scotland...

01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:25.621
Ah. James.

01:25:27.748 --> 01:25:29.500
The son of Mary.

01:25:29.667 --> 01:25:32.128
She tried to take my throne.

01:25:33.254 --> 01:25:35.923
No son of hers will ever rule.

01:25:36.924 --> 01:25:41.262
I'll decide what is best
for my people. Not you.

01:25:42.429 --> 01:25:44.807
I have bid Edward to come to me

01:25:44.974 --> 01:25:48.435
when I return to London
on Monday next. It is decided.

01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:06.078
<i>And so, in spite of death</i>

01:26:06.745 --> 01:26:09.165
<i>I shall survive</i>

01:26:09.331 --> 01:26:12.835
<i>In that my likeness</i>

01:26:13.002 --> 01:26:15.629
<i>Still is left alive.</i>

01:26:29.018 --> 01:26:34.565
... love's majesty
to strut before a wanton ambling nymph.

01:26:34.732 --> 01:26:38.944
I, that am curtailed
of this fair proportion,

01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:41.906
cheated of feature
by dissembling nature,

01:26:42.072 --> 01:26:44.491
deformed, unfinish'd,

01:26:44.658 --> 01:26:49.538
sent before my time
into this breathing world,

01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:54.668
and that so lamely
and unfashionable,

01:26:54.835 --> 01:26:57.963
that dogs bark at me...

01:26:58.672 --> 01:27:00.674
Aw. Come on, Burbage.

01:27:02.718 --> 01:27:04.220
I'll be arrested.

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:05.888
Arrested? Ha.

01:27:06.055 --> 01:27:07.681
It's just the one performance.

01:27:07.848 --> 01:27:09.516
I need a drink.

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:13.103
I'll be at the Mermaid.
I'll be back in a minute.

01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:15.522
You left the hump on.

01:27:15.689 --> 01:27:16.732
Burbage. Ah.

01:27:17.191 --> 01:27:19.818
Wonderful theater.
Wonderful.

01:27:19.985 --> 01:27:24.240
So only one performance, then?
That bad, is it?

01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:26.700
Hardly. That's Will's new play.

01:27:27.243 --> 01:27:31.163
Richard <i>the</i> Third. We've been hired
to perform it free to the public.

01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:32.998
Free?
Aye.

01:27:33.165 --> 01:27:36.168
Some anonymous nobleman's
paid for everything.

01:27:36.335 --> 01:27:37.920
Been rehearsing all week.

01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:40.422
Uh... SO, uh...

01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:42.675
My best so far.

01:27:46.262 --> 01:27:47.888
I'm sorry, Ben.

01:27:49.223 --> 01:27:53.686
Will, he's part owner, and, uh...

01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:56.355
I'm sorry, Ben,

01:27:56.522 --> 01:27:58.399
but I had to agree.

01:27:58.565 --> 01:28:01.944
No Jonson plays at the Globe.

01:28:02.403 --> 01:28:04.071
Ever.

01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:17.626
- Mm.
- Drink.

01:28:18.544 --> 01:28:21.213
Best villain in
theater history, Richard Ill.

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.007
Better than Mephistopheles?

01:28:23.173 --> 01:28:27.636
No doubt. Jonson's not bad for
everyday scalawags, but Shakespeare...

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:32.308
My God, the main knows his villains.
Not even the Greeks compare.

01:28:33.142 --> 01:28:35.227
To Shakespeare!

01:28:35.394 --> 01:28:37.229
And villainy.

01:28:37.563 --> 01:28:39.982
To Shakespeare and villainy!

01:28:43.152 --> 01:28:45.404
- Try your luck.
- Thanks.

01:28:45.946 --> 01:28:49.450
Fancy a tumble?
Only tuppence.

01:28:49.616 --> 01:28:51.493
Wet in all the wrong places.

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:56.415
- I haven't got all night, Jonson.
- I...

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:00.502
There is a...

01:29:03.756 --> 01:29:07.384
There is a play to be performed

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:08.844
on Monday.

01:29:09.345 --> 01:29:11.680
All Bankside is talking of it.

01:29:11.847 --> 01:29:14.099
<i>The Tragedy
of King Richard the Third</i>

01:29:14.266 --> 01:29:16.185
by William Shakespeare.

01:29:18.103 --> 01:29:21.607
He kills the king and half
the royal family to get the throne.

01:29:21.774 --> 01:29:24.193
I know who Richard Ill was.

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:25.611
Yes.

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:30.366
But in William Shakespeare's
version,

01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:32.993
he is played as a hunchback.

01:29:39.333 --> 01:29:40.834
As a what?

01:30:00.062 --> 01:30:02.398
Shall I close the theater?

01:30:04.316 --> 01:30:05.484
No.

01:30:19.415 --> 01:30:21.250
Pray, stand back!

01:30:21.417 --> 01:30:25.254
The theater is full!
There is no more room!

01:30:27.005 --> 01:30:29.091
The theater is full!

01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:40.227
You can't get through the crowds.
We've turned hundreds away.

01:30:40.602 --> 01:30:42.396
Never seen anything like it.

01:30:42.563 --> 01:30:45.607
And you said I was mad
for building a bigger theater.

01:30:59.288 --> 01:31:02.624
Has Francesco left?
Yes, my lord.

01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:07.045
<i>Now is the winter of our discontent,</i>

01:31:07.254 --> 01:31:11.216
made glorious summer
by this sun of York.

01:31:11.383 --> 01:31:13.051
He's got a hunchback.

01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:16.805
And all the clouds that
loured upon our house

01:31:16.972 --> 01:31:20.476
in the deep bosom of the ocean.

01:31:20.642 --> 01:31:21.768
It's Cecil, isn't it?

01:31:23.187 --> 01:31:26.899
Now are our brows
bound with victorious wreaths,

01:31:27.065 --> 01:31:29.985
our bruised arms hung up
for monuments,

01:31:30.152 --> 01:31:32.738
our stern alarums
changed to merry meetings,

01:31:34.198 --> 01:31:37.993
our dreadful marches
to delightful measures.

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:42.080
Grim-visaged war hath
smoothed his wrinkled front.

01:31:43.624 --> 01:31:48.170
But I, that am not shaped
for sportive tricks,

01:31:48.337 --> 01:31:52.508
<i>nor made to court
an amorous looking glass.</i>

01:31:52.674 --> 01:31:55.636
<i>I, that am rudely stamped,</i>

01:31:55.802 --> 01:31:59.598
<i>and want love's majesty
to strut before</i>

01:31:59.765 --> 01:32:02.434
<i>a wanton ambling nymph.</i>

01:32:02.601 --> 01:32:07.189
I, that am curtailed
of this fair proportion,

01:32:08.190 --> 01:32:12.444
cheated of feature
by dissembling nature,

01:32:12.611 --> 01:32:14.613
<i>deformed, unfinish'd,</i>

01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:18.867
<i>sent before my time
into this breathing world,</i>

01:32:19.034 --> 01:32:20.702
<i>scarce half made up,</i>

01:32:20.869 --> 01:32:25.541
<i>and that so lamely
and unfashionable</i>

01:32:25.707 --> 01:32:29.336
<i>that dogs bark at</i> me...

01:32:33.882 --> 01:32:36.051
<i>Hear this! Hear this!</i>

01:32:36.218 --> 01:32:40.389
By order of the Privy Council, the
bridge must be cleared immediately!

01:32:40.556 --> 01:32:44.059
Anyone resisting will be
taken to the Tower!

01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:46.645
Clear the bridge! Clear the bridge!

01:32:48.021 --> 01:32:51.650
<i>Nothing rash.
No man is to draw sword or fire musket</i>

01:32:51.817 --> 01:32:53.902
without direct order.
Yes, my lord.

01:32:54.069 --> 01:32:56.405
And the mob?
When does it arrive?

01:32:56.572 --> 01:32:58.574
By the stroke of 4.

01:32:59.366 --> 01:33:01.034
The streets are quiet.

01:33:01.201 --> 01:33:03.078
They are all at the theater.

01:33:04.162 --> 01:33:08.584
Edward promised us a mob,
and a mob we will have.

01:33:09.418 --> 01:33:12.588
I am determined
to prove a villain...

01:33:12.754 --> 01:33:14.590
A pox on you!

01:33:14.756 --> 01:33:16.425
A pox on Cecil!

01:33:16.592 --> 01:33:18.760
Why is Oxford's man
with the ground lings?

01:33:18.927 --> 01:33:20.429
Where?
There.

01:33:20.596 --> 01:33:23.390
... and hate
the idle pleasures of these days.

01:33:23.557 --> 01:33:25.392
Plots have I laid,
inductions dangerous,

01:33:26.893 --> 01:33:31.064
by drunken prophecies, libels,
and dreams, to set the...

01:33:31.231 --> 01:33:33.775
To set my brother Clarence
and the king...

01:33:33.942 --> 01:33:35.277
What's going on?

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:07.392
♪ To see a fine lady
Ride on a white horse ♪

01:34:07.559 --> 01:34:10.145
♪ Rings on her fingers
Bells on her toes ♪

♪ She shall have music

01:34:14.524 --> 01:34:16.151
Me lord?

01:34:17.486 --> 01:34:19.154
Her Majesty will be
with you shortly.

01:34:19.321 --> 01:34:22.115
Young, valiant and wise
and no doubt right...

01:34:24.117 --> 01:34:26.119
Down with Cecil!

01:34:26.828 --> 01:34:29.122
Richard!
Get over here!

01:34:29.289 --> 01:34:31.291
Off to Stratford, then.

01:34:31.458 --> 01:34:32.584
To Essex House!

01:34:32.751 --> 01:34:35.462
- To Essex House!
- We want Essex!

01:34:35.962 --> 01:34:37.506
Oh, my God.

01:34:37.673 --> 01:34:40.509
Essex! Essex!
Francesco!

01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:42.636
To Essex House!

01:34:42.803 --> 01:34:44.680
I have to warn him!

01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:46.598
Francesco!

01:34:46.765 --> 01:34:48.183
The Tower!

01:34:48.433 --> 01:34:49.768
Francesco!

01:34:51.436 --> 01:34:53.772
Francesco! The Tower knows!

01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:55.607
How do you think it ends?

01:34:55.857 --> 01:34:57.192
No doubt, tragically.

01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:02.531
- Join us!
- Francesco!

01:35:02.698 --> 01:35:04.616
<i>Essex! Essex! Essex!</i>

01:35:04.783 --> 01:35:07.994
For Essex! And England!

01:35:08.161 --> 01:35:11.206
Francesco! I went to the Tower!

01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:19.047
To your positions!

01:35:20.549 --> 01:35:22.134
Make ready!

01:35:32.561 --> 01:35:34.730
Open fire!

01:35:36.982 --> 01:35:38.275
Fire!

01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:44.656
Aah! MANI Go back!

01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:52.998
- Francesco!
- Signor Jonson!

01:35:53.165 --> 01:35:55.167
We are betrayed! Unh!

01:35:55.333 --> 01:35:56.752
No!

01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:12.434
Robert, wait.

01:36:13.185 --> 01:36:14.686
No more waiting.

01:36:15.187 --> 01:36:18.023
We go as we are now.

01:36:18.190 --> 01:36:19.858
Mount your horses.

01:36:20.025 --> 01:36:21.568
Mount your horses!

01:36:21.735 --> 01:36:23.862
On your horses, everyone!

01:36:26.364 --> 01:36:27.449
To the queen! Hyah!

01:36:27.616 --> 01:36:29.034
To the queen!

01:36:29.534 --> 01:36:30.869
Hyah!

01:37:02.984 --> 01:37:04.319
It's a trap!

01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:06.571
Spread out!

01:37:06.738 --> 01:37:07.781
Fire!

01:37:09.241 --> 01:37:10.283
Freedom!

01:37:11.535 --> 01:37:13.078
Fire at will!

01:37:21.586 --> 01:37:24.005
Fireworks? Huh.

01:37:28.927 --> 01:37:33.056
Majesty! We must away.
Essex is in armed revolt.

01:37:33.223 --> 01:37:35.517
He's come to overthrow you.
But, Edward...

01:37:36.017 --> 01:37:39.521
You must flee quickly, Majesty.
He means to kill you

01:37:39.688 --> 01:37:41.940
and take the throne for himself.

01:37:42.107 --> 01:37:43.525
Please, Majesty.

01:37:44.025 --> 01:37:45.861
Your Majesty.

01:37:53.535 --> 01:37:55.704
Aah!
Robert!

01:37:57.330 --> 01:37:58.665
The men!

01:37:58.832 --> 01:38:00.667
We must yield!

01:38:01.459 --> 01:38:02.627
We yield!

01:38:02.794 --> 01:38:04.004
Hold your fire!

01:38:04.170 --> 01:38:05.881
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

01:38:06.047 --> 01:38:07.841
Deliver up your arms!

01:38:13.346 --> 01:38:15.181
Put down your arms.

01:38:15.432 --> 01:38:17.017
Keep still!

01:38:18.643 --> 01:38:20.437
Lay down your muskets.

01:38:21.021 --> 01:38:22.564
We yield.

01:38:24.065 --> 01:38:26.067
Yield, sir!

01:38:37.287 --> 01:38:40.665
She will not forgive him this,
Edward.

01:38:42.334 --> 01:38:45.086
Essex will be convicted,

01:38:45.253 --> 01:38:47.756
and executed

01:38:48.214 --> 01:38:50.258
for treason.

01:38:52.218 --> 01:38:54.054
As will your son.

01:38:56.890 --> 01:38:58.600
What?

01:38:58.767 --> 01:39:01.394
Didn't you think I knew?

01:39:02.437 --> 01:39:07.359
My father told me all his secrets.
All of them.

01:39:07.776 --> 01:39:10.612
Though the most fascinating

01:39:10.779 --> 01:39:14.449
was not made known to me
until after his death.

01:39:16.284 --> 01:39:18.912
He hated you, Edward.

01:39:19.079 --> 01:39:22.457
But still, he married
his only daughter to you.

01:39:22.958 --> 01:39:26.294
He wanted his grandson
to be an earl.

01:39:26.461 --> 01:39:29.881
No, Edward.
He wanted his grandson to be

01:39:30.048 --> 01:39:31.091
a king.

01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:38.139
Elizabeth had several
bastard children, Edward.

01:39:38.306 --> 01:39:41.101
Not just Essex and Southampton.

01:39:41.851 --> 01:39:44.646
She was 16 for the first.

01:39:44.813 --> 01:39:50.568
Bloody Mary was still queen and
our future Gloriana was out of favor.

01:39:50.735 --> 01:39:55.490
No one thought her very important
at all, except my father, of course.

01:39:55.657 --> 01:39:58.076
And when her first child was born...

01:39:59.327 --> 01:40:01.079
a male,

01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:05.083
my father took it and hid it.

01:40:06.668 --> 01:40:09.087
The grandson of Henry VIII.

01:40:09.254 --> 01:40:13.967
The foundling, of course,
had to be reared a nobleman.

01:40:19.431 --> 01:40:20.932
John de Vere,

01:40:21.516 --> 01:40:24.269
the previous Earl of Oxford,

01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:27.605
agreed to accept the task.

01:40:27.772 --> 01:40:29.149
You lie!

01:40:29.524 --> 01:40:31.026
Do I?

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:36.531
Why did he work so hard to become
your guardian after your father died?

01:40:37.532 --> 01:40:41.619
He had it all planned.
Years in advance.

01:40:41.786 --> 01:40:45.206
He would teach you everything
he knew about statecraft,

01:40:45.373 --> 01:40:50.503
marry you to his daughter, and after
Elizabeth's death, proclaim you...

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.048
heir.

01:40:54.215 --> 01:40:57.135
His own grandchild
to follow you on the throne.

01:40:57.302 --> 01:41:02.307
But he could not possibly predict what
kind of failure you would become!

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:06.728
How you would fail in politics!

01:41:06.895 --> 01:41:10.774
Ignore your estates
to the point of bankruptcy.

01:41:12.567 --> 01:41:14.569
All to write...

01:41:18.573 --> 01:41:20.075
Poetry,

01:41:27.248 --> 01:41:30.585
Nor could he have predicted
that you would commit incest.

01:41:33.505 --> 01:41:35.256
Oh.

01:41:36.716 --> 01:41:40.220
Delicious, isn't it?

01:41:40.386 --> 01:41:42.722
Right out of a Greek...

01:41:43.598 --> 01:41:45.600
tragedy...

01:41:48.269 --> 01:41:49.771
Elizabeth...

01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:53.942
What? would never have...

01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:57.445
Slept with her son?

01:41:59.531 --> 01:42:02.408
I don't think she ever knew,
to tell you the truth.

01:42:03.618 --> 01:42:06.204
Though you never know
with the Tudors.

01:42:06.996 --> 01:42:11.626
They all have had such strange
tastes in bedfellows.

01:42:15.171 --> 01:42:18.466
You could have been
a king, Edward.

01:42:20.009 --> 01:42:22.011
And your son after you.

01:42:22.887 --> 01:42:24.806
Except for the fact...

01:42:24.973 --> 01:42:26.850
that you...

01:42:27.725 --> 01:42:29.310
were you.

01:43:27.243 --> 01:43:29.329
Sentence has been passed.

01:43:32.498 --> 01:43:34.500
They are to be beheaded.

01:43:37.670 --> 01:43:40.506
Essex tomorrow.
Southampton in a week.

01:43:43.176 --> 01:43:45.220
Your son is
going to be killed...

01:43:47.513 --> 01:43:49.182
by his own mother.

01:43:51.017 --> 01:43:53.353
Put that in one of your plays.

01:44:02.278 --> 01:44:04.113
Robert Devereaux,

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:07.659
Earl of Essex,
is hereby executed

01:44:07.825 --> 01:44:12.163
for treason by Her Gracious Majesty,
Queen Elizabeth

01:44:12.330 --> 01:44:16.000
on the 25th day of February
in the year of our Lord,

01:44:16.167 --> 01:44:18.253
1601.

01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:27.303
Strike true.

01:44:32.558 --> 01:44:34.102
God save the queen!

01:45:06.342 --> 01:45:07.844
Leave us.

01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:10.054
All of you.

01:45:14.183 --> 01:45:15.601
Sir Robert,

01:45:16.352 --> 01:45:17.645
you as well.

01:45:31.951 --> 01:45:33.661
You look old.

01:45:35.204 --> 01:45:37.332
I thank Your Majesty
for seeing me.

01:45:38.458 --> 01:45:40.001
You cannot have him.

01:45:40.168 --> 01:45:41.336
He is our son.

01:45:41.502 --> 01:45:43.296
He is a traitor, like Essex.

01:45:43.463 --> 01:45:46.215
They only wished for a voice
equal to their birth.

01:45:46.382 --> 01:45:49.010
You caused this.
Your play, your words.

01:45:49.177 --> 01:45:50.928
I know what you've done.

01:45:51.804 --> 01:45:53.973
Your head should be cut off,
not his.

01:46:02.315 --> 01:46:03.649
Then take it,

01:46:04.150 --> 01:46:06.152
in our son's stead.

01:46:12.325 --> 01:46:15.036
Neither they nor I
conspired against you.

01:46:15.203 --> 01:46:17.163
Cecil alone was our aim.

01:46:17.372 --> 01:46:20.541
The King of Spain, Mary,
four French kings, eight popes,

01:46:20.708 --> 01:46:24.629
they all wanted me dead,
but here I am,

01:46:24.796 --> 01:46:27.465
because of the Cecile,
my commoners.

01:46:27.632 --> 01:46:29.175
We would have protected you.

01:46:29.342 --> 01:46:31.844
You? My loyal earls? Hm.

01:46:33.137 --> 01:46:35.223
I could only ever trust
the Cecile

01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:39.477
because their wealth, their power,
their survival, all depended on me.

01:46:39.644 --> 01:46:40.686
Me.

01:46:41.813 --> 01:46:43.314
Let...

01:46:44.816 --> 01:46:47.568
our son live.

01:46:53.157 --> 01:46:54.826
Does...?

01:46:56.494 --> 01:46:58.246
Does he know?

01:46:59.622 --> 01:47:03.334
And if I give him to you...?

01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:11.426
He will never learn of it
from me.

01:47:53.050 --> 01:47:54.302
But, Edward?

01:47:56.387 --> 01:47:59.515
None of your poems,

01:47:59.807 --> 01:48:01.726
or your plays

01:48:01.893 --> 01:48:04.979
will ever carry your name.

01:48:06.397 --> 01:48:07.857
None.

01:48:23.122 --> 01:48:26.542
Is she still refusing to sleep?
For three days now.

01:48:27.502 --> 01:48:29.253
And her physicians?

01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:31.589
They say she's dying...

01:48:53.110 --> 01:48:54.946
Majesty?

01:48:55.404 --> 01:48:58.866
I have brought you
a document to sign.

01:49:05.456 --> 01:49:08.209
The Act of Succession.

01:49:17.093 --> 01:49:19.011
I beseech you,

01:49:20.054 --> 01:49:21.430
sign.

01:49:56.424 --> 01:49:59.093
<i>O God, bless this crown,</i>

01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:01.929
and sanctify
King James of Scotland,

01:50:02.096 --> 01:50:06.309
now and forevermore
as King James the First of England,

01:50:06.475 --> 01:50:10.146
Scotland, Wales and Ireland.

01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:27.371
God save the king!

01:50:27.538 --> 01:50:29.123
God save the king!

01:51:06.118 --> 01:51:07.995
No, no, no, stop!

01:51:08.162 --> 01:51:10.414
It's supposed to be
a bloody comedy.

01:51:10.581 --> 01:51:12.750
You lot are about as funny
as the plague.

01:51:12.917 --> 01:51:14.377
Will!

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:17.296
Will Shakespeare!
Hello, Ben.

01:51:17.463 --> 01:51:21.133
A command performance
for our new king.

01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:23.761
Fraud! Charlatan!

01:51:23.928 --> 01:51:27.515
A counterfeiter of wit!

01:51:31.602 --> 01:51:33.145
You came to me, Ben.

01:51:35.231 --> 01:51:37.066
You came to me.

01:51:38.818 --> 01:51:40.820
Will! You're nothing but a puppet!

01:51:40.986 --> 01:51:42.279
Get out!

01:51:43.114 --> 01:51:44.407
Stay out!

01:51:45.491 --> 01:51:47.159
Master Jonson?

01:51:48.369 --> 01:51:50.329
His lordship is asking for you.

01:51:59.672 --> 01:52:01.841
Excuse me, my lady.

01:52:23.195 --> 01:52:24.905
Thank you, doctor.

01:52:29.785 --> 01:52:31.245
Jonson.

01:52:31.787 --> 01:52:33.330
Come closer.

01:52:46.093 --> 01:52:48.429
Did you know my family can trace

01:52:48.596 --> 01:52:52.266
its peerage back further than
any other family in the kingdom?

01:52:53.476 --> 01:52:58.147
We fought at Crecy,
at Bosworth Field, at Agincourt.

01:52:59.982 --> 01:53:01.609
When I inherited my earldom,

01:53:01.776 --> 01:53:05.654
I was one of the richest men
ever to breathe English air.

01:53:05.821 --> 01:53:09.158
And at last breath,
I shall be one of the poorest.

01:53:10.493 --> 01:53:12.828
Never a voice in government.

01:53:13.996 --> 01:53:17.708
Never a sword raised
in glorious battle.

01:53:19.043 --> 01:53:20.628
Words.

01:53:21.962 --> 01:53:25.800
Merely words shall be
my sole legacy.

01:53:27.635 --> 01:53:31.388
You alone watch my plays
and know them as mine.

01:53:32.181 --> 01:53:34.183
When I hear the applause,

01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:37.728
the cheering of the audience,
the hands clapping,

01:53:37.895 --> 01:53:40.523
I know they are celebrating
another man.

01:53:42.691 --> 01:53:44.193
But in that

01:53:45.486 --> 01:53:49.698
cacophony of sounds,
I strained to hear two hands only.

01:53:50.866 --> 01:53:52.201
Yours.

01:53:53.202 --> 01:53:55.371
But hear them, I never did.

01:53:58.374 --> 01:54:00.709
You have never told me...

01:54:03.379 --> 01:54:04.797
Never...

01:54:05.714 --> 01:54:09.009
told me what you thought
of my work.

01:54:16.892 --> 01:54:18.519
I find

01:54:19.228 --> 01:54:20.896
your words

01:54:21.564 --> 01:54:23.566
the most

01:54:23.858 --> 01:54:24.942
wondrous

01:54:26.402 --> 01:54:28.237
heard on our stage.

01:54:30.072 --> 01:54:32.074
On any stage.

01:54:33.409 --> 01:54:34.869
Ever.

01:54:37.037 --> 01:54:38.414
You

01:54:38.581 --> 01:54:40.791
are the soul of the age.

01:55:00.936 --> 01:55:03.230
Promise me, Jonson.

01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:09.820
Promise you'll keep our secret safe,
that you won't expose Shakespeare.

01:55:09.987 --> 01:55:12.031
My lord...
I've seen it in your face.

01:55:12.197 --> 01:55:13.782
He vexes you.

01:55:13.949 --> 01:55:17.536
How could he not?
But he is not your burden.

01:55:19.288 --> 01:55:20.664
He is mine.

01:55:31.133 --> 01:55:32.593
All my writings...

01:55:35.304 --> 01:55:37.473
"W plays, my sonnets...

01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:42.186
keep them safe.
Keep them from my family.

01:55:42.478 --> 01:55:44.146
The Cecile.

01:55:46.273 --> 01:55:48.442
Wait a few years
and then publish them.

01:55:48.609 --> 01:55:49.777
My lord, I...

01:55:50.486 --> 01:55:52.613
I am not worthy of this charge.

01:55:55.616 --> 01:55:56.867
I betrayed you.

01:55:57.826 --> 01:55:59.995
I told them of your...

01:56:00.162 --> 01:56:05.459
I have made it my life's work to know
the character of men, Jonson.

01:56:07.836 --> 01:56:09.755
I know you.

01:56:12.967 --> 01:56:15.010
You may have betrayed me...

01:56:17.179 --> 01:56:20.641
but you will never
betray my words.

01:56:35.489 --> 01:56:36.490
What are those?

01:56:38.367 --> 01:56:40.369
These are my...

01:56:41.036 --> 01:56:43.998
My lady, your husband was-
Get out.

01:56:44.164 --> 01:56:47.334
You, your friends,
your blasphemous theater

01:56:47.501 --> 01:56:50.004
have brought ruin
and dishonor to this family.

01:56:50.170 --> 01:56:51.505
Ruin?

01:56:52.881 --> 01:56:54.216
Dishonor?

01:56:55.384 --> 01:56:56.427
My lady,

01:56:57.553 --> 01:57:01.348
you, your family, even I,

01:57:01.515 --> 01:57:03.642
even Queen Elizabeth herself,

01:57:03.809 --> 01:57:08.564
will be remembered solely
because we had the honor to live

01:57:08.731 --> 01:57:12.359
whilst your husband
put ink to paper.

01:57:23.245 --> 01:57:28.542
<i>The love I dedicate
to your lordship is without end,</i>

01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:31.336
<i>whereof this pamphlet,</i>

01:57:31.503 --> 01:57:34.298
<i>without a superfluous moiety.</i>

01:57:35.883 --> 01:57:38.218
<i>What I have done is yours,</i>

01:57:38.761 --> 01:57:41.263
<i>what I have to do is yours.</i>

01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:44.933
<i>Being part in all I have,</i>

01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:47.811
<i>devoted yours."</i>

01:57:59.907 --> 01:58:01.742
I can make

01:58:02.576 --> 01:58:04.244
all this

01:58:04.912 --> 01:58:07.706
go away, Jonson.

01:58:07.956 --> 01:58:11.502
Or I can bring you so much

01:58:12.127 --> 01:58:14.088
Pain.

01:58:16.131 --> 01:58:17.591
Pain.

01:58:19.635 --> 01:58:21.762
I know you have them.

01:58:23.472 --> 01:58:25.933
All his manuscripts.

01:58:27.142 --> 01:58:31.647
My sister saw you leave Oxford
Stone with them under your arm.

01:58:33.482 --> 01:58:35.609
They were destroyed.

01:58:37.486 --> 01:58:38.737
Burned.

01:58:38.904 --> 01:58:40.280
Burned?

01:58:41.782 --> 01:58:43.117
By your men.

01:58:44.827 --> 01:58:49.414
Every word went up in flames
when you torched the theater.

01:58:50.290 --> 01:58:51.834
He's lying.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.086
My lord,

01:58:54.837 --> 01:58:56.797
why would I lie?

01:58:58.006 --> 01:59:00.801
He was something

01:59:00.968 --> 01:59:02.803
I could never be.

01:59:03.679 --> 01:59:07.141
An undeniable perfection

01:59:07.683 --> 01:59:10.185
that plagued my soul.

01:59:11.854 --> 01:59:13.313
And to him,

01:59:14.189 --> 01:59:15.858
I was nothing.

01:59:16.859 --> 01:59:18.902
A messenger.

01:59:21.363 --> 01:59:24.616
He tells the truth.

01:59:28.203 --> 01:59:29.705
Let him go.

01:59:30.497 --> 01:59:31.665
Guard!

01:59:33.834 --> 01:59:35.169
Release him.

01:59:43.802 --> 01:59:47.264
And, Jonson?
Better him, won't you?

01:59:47.431 --> 01:59:50.350
Wipe his memory for all time.

01:59:51.894 --> 01:59:55.522
I'm afraid that is not possible,
my lord.

02:00:15.834 --> 02:00:17.294
Your Majesty.

02:00:17.461 --> 02:00:20.005
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

02:00:21.256 --> 02:00:22.341
Marvelous.

02:00:24.092 --> 02:00:26.261
Marvelous, marvelous.

02:00:29.264 --> 02:00:32.267
Is it not marvelous?

02:01:42.462 --> 02:01:44.798
O for a <i>Muse</i> of fire

02:01:45.007 --> 02:01:49.261
<i>that would ascend
the brightest heaven of invention.</i>

02:01:49.428 --> 02:01:53.140
<i>A kingdom for a stage,
princes to act</i>

02:01:54.016 --> 02:01:57.644
and monarchs to behold
the swelling scene.

02:01:58.562 --> 02:02:01.606
We had seen some
of this Shakespeare's plays

02:02:01.773 --> 02:02:03.859
in Edinburgh, Sir Robert.

02:02:04.026 --> 02:02:06.820
I must tell you,
we enjoyed them immensely

02:02:06.987 --> 02:02:10.615
and look forward to seeing many
more, now that we're in London.

02:02:11.033 --> 02:02:16.246
I assume you're as avid
a theater man as myself.

02:02:17.205 --> 02:02:19.458
Of course, Your Majesty.

02:02:19.624 --> 02:02:24.004
... that have dared
on this unworthy scaffold

02:02:24.171 --> 02:02:26.631
to bring forth so great an object.

02:02:26.798 --> 02:02:31.511
Robert Cecil
remained the most powerful man

02:02:31.678 --> 02:02:34.222
in the court of King James,

02:02:34.514 --> 02:02:37.225
though he couldn't prevent
the public theaters

02:02:37.392 --> 02:02:40.145
from becoming ever more popular.

02:02:40.687 --> 02:02:44.066
William Shakespeare, however,
spent the remainder of his days,

02:02:44.232 --> 02:02:46.526
not in the playhouses of London,

02:02:46.693 --> 02:02:50.697
but in the small town of his birth,
Stratford-upon-Avon,

02:02:50.864 --> 02:02:54.534
as a businessman
and grain merchant.

02:02:54.701 --> 02:02:57.454
Ben Jonson succeeded
in his desire

02:02:57.621 --> 02:03:00.457
to be the most celebrated
playwright of his time,

02:03:00.624 --> 02:03:03.794
becoming England's
first poet laureate.

02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:07.172
And in 1623,
he wrote the dedication

02:03:07.339 --> 02:03:11.510
to the collected works
of the man we call

02:03:11.676 --> 02:03:13.470
William Shakespeare.

02:03:15.055 --> 02:03:16.598
And so,

02:03:17.224 --> 02:03:22.687
though our story is finished,
our poet's is not.

02:03:23.063 --> 02:03:26.775
For his monument is ever-living,

02:03:26.942 --> 02:03:32.197
made not of stone, but of verse.

02:03:32.739 --> 02:03:35.075
And it shall be remembered

02:03:35.242 --> 02:03:38.912
as long as words
are made of breath

02:03:39.079 --> 02:03:41.915
and breath of life.
