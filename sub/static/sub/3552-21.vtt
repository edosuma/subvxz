WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.503
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.503 --> 00:04.705
LYNETTE FOUND
THAT DATING TOM'S BOSS...

00:04.705 --> 00:06.337
IF I ASKED YOU TO HAVE TOM
WORK A FEW NIGHTS THIS WEEK,

00:06.337 --> 00:07.708
YOU'D DO IT?

00:07.708 --> 00:09.140
YOU JUST SAY THE WORD.

00:09.140 --> 00:10.641
HAD ITS ADVANTAGES.

00:10.641 --> 00:14.185
I'M SENDING TOM TO MUMBAI
FOR A YEAR.

00:14.185 --> 00:17.048
JULIE MADE A BIG DECISION
ABOUT HER BABY.

00:17.048 --> 00:18.389
I'M GONNA KEEP HER.

00:18.389 --> 00:21.352
AND THE BABY'S FATHER
MADE A COMMITMENT.

00:21.352 --> 00:23.124
I'LL GET A JOB.
I'LL TAKE--I'LL TAKE CLASSES.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.625
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.097
CARLOS.
 CARLOS AND GABY ARGUED...

00:26.097 --> 00:27.728
I AM NOT GONNA LET BREE

00:27.728 --> 00:29.560
TAKE THE FALL FOR A CRIME
I COMMITTED.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.602
AFTER BREE WAS ARRESTED
FOR MURDER.

00:31.602 --> 00:34.465
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES
WHERE THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO

00:34.465 --> 00:35.806
IS DO NOTHING.

00:35.806 --> 00:37.808
BUT BREE'S ATTORNEY
WAS CONFIDENT...

00:37.808 --> 00:39.670
DID YOU, UH, HAVE SOME
NEW THOUGHTS ON THE CASE?

00:39.670 --> 00:41.642
WHY DON'T WE DISCUSS THEM
OVER DINNER?

00:41.642 --> 00:44.044
AS WELL AS CONVINCING.

00:48.479 --> 00:51.082
(Mary Alice) SINCE
BREE VAN DE KAMP WAS ARRESTED,

00:51.082 --> 00:55.456
SHE HAD EXPERIENCED
A WIDE RANGE OF EMOTIONS.

00:56.527 --> 01:01.162
ONE MOMENT, SHE FELT AFRAID.

01:01.162 --> 01:05.336
THE NEXT, SHE WAS ANGRY.

01:05.336 --> 01:10.141
AND THROUGH IT ALL,
SHE FELT ASHAMED.

01:12.343 --> 01:14.805
BUT NOW THAT HER TRIAL
WAS APPROACHING,

01:14.805 --> 01:18.149
SHE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL...

01:18.149 --> 01:21.112
A LITTLE RATTLED.

01:21.112 --> 01:22.853
BREE, ARE YOU OKAY?

01:22.853 --> 01:25.386
YEAH. JUST ALL THIS
WITNESS PREPARATION

01:25.386 --> 01:27.188
IS MAKING ME NERVOUS.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.819
GABY'S BEEN IN THERE
FOR AGES.

01:28.819 --> 01:30.161
TRIP'S VERY THOROUGH.

01:30.161 --> 01:32.263
HE JUST WANTS TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE ALL READY.

01:32.263 --> 01:34.165
(sighs)

01:34.165 --> 01:37.128
THERE YOU ARE.
THAT TOOK A WHILE.
 NO KIDDING.

01:37.128 --> 01:38.129
I HAVEN'T BEEN GRILLED LIKE THAT

01:38.129 --> 01:39.630
SINCE CARLOS GOT
MY LAST CREDIT CARD BILL.

01:39.630 --> 01:41.272
WELL, AS ALIBI WITNESSES,

01:41.272 --> 01:43.103
YOU'RE GONNA BE ASKED ABOUT
EVERY DETAIL OF THE NIGHT

01:43.103 --> 01:45.136
THAT RAMON DISAPPEARED.

01:45.136 --> 01:48.209
AND WE CAN'T AFFORD
ANY SLIP-UPS.

01:48.209 --> 01:51.382
SO... HOW MANY DINNER GUESTS
WERE THERE THAT NIGHT?

01:51.382 --> 01:53.184
14.

01:53.184 --> 01:55.516
WHAT COLOR DRESS
WAS BREE WEARING?
 RED.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.318
WHAT SAUCE DID SHE SERVE
WITH THE CHICKEN?

01:57.318 --> 01:59.190
OH. I GOT THIS.

01:59.190 --> 02:00.351
BARBECUE?

02:00.351 --> 02:02.253
GABY, OF ALL THE THINGS
I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF,

02:02.253 --> 02:04.455
THE IDEA THAT I WOULD
SERVE BARBECUE SAUCE

02:04.455 --> 02:06.157
AT A DINNER PARTY!

02:06.157 --> 02:07.258
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

02:07.258 --> 02:09.400
THAT SOUNDS WAY WORSE THAN
SAYING YOU KILLED ALEJANDRO.

02:11.202 --> 02:14.765
WAIT. UH... WHO'S ALEJANDRO?

02:14.765 --> 02:17.408
UH, MY GARDENER.

02:17.408 --> 02:20.811
I'M ALWAYS GETTING...
MY MEXICANS CONFUSED...

02:20.811 --> 02:23.544
WHICH I'M ALLOWED TO DO,
BECAUSE I'M MEXICAN.

02:23.544 --> 02:27.147
I GOTTA RUN. YOU, UH,
YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

02:27.147 --> 02:28.479
OF COURSE.
WITH YOU IN MY CORNER,

02:28.479 --> 02:29.680
HOW CAN I NOT BE?

02:35.286 --> 02:37.858
(door opens and closes)

02:37.858 --> 02:40.531
OKAY. WHAT WAS THAT
LITTLE PROM PHOTO MOMENT

02:40.531 --> 02:41.662
WITH THE HANDS?

02:41.662 --> 02:42.893
WE WARNED YOU ABOUT THIS.

02:42.893 --> 02:44.495
YOU'RE STILL GOING AFTER HIM,
AREN'T YOU?

02:44.495 --> 02:46.567
OF COURSE NOT. I AM TOTALLY
FOCUSED ON THE CASE,

02:46.567 --> 02:47.938
AND SO IS HE.

02:49.770 --> 02:53.204
OKAY, FINE.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

02:53.204 --> 02:56.647
HE IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT,
CARING, CHARMING MAN

02:56.647 --> 02:58.209
I HAVE MET IN AGES.
 (vehicle approaches,
brakes squeal)

02:58.209 --> 03:00.351
AND BY THE WAY, IT ISN'T
EXACTLY A ONE-WAY STREET.

03:00.351 --> 03:03.884
HE'S BEEN SHOWING QUITE A BIT
OF INTERESTING IN ME, TOO.
 (vehicle door opens)

03:03.884 --> 03:07.758
UM, BREE--
 AND BESIDES, IF I REJECT HIM,
HE MIGHT BE TOO HUMILIATED

03:07.758 --> 03:10.221
TO DO A GOOD JOB
ON MY CASE.
 YEAH?

03:10.221 --> 03:13.193
SOMETHING TELLS ME
HE'S GONNA BOUNCE BACK.

03:18.429 --> 03:22.373
YES, AFTER BREE VAN DE KAMP
WAS ARRESTED,

03:22.373 --> 03:25.306
SHE FELT A RANGE OF EMOTIONS.

03:27.508 --> 03:32.243
BUT THE ONE THING
SHE DIDN'T EXPECT TO FEEL...

03:32.243 --> 03:34.385
WAS JEALOUSY.

03:46.557 --> 03:48.699
AT
THE FAIRVIEW CHILDBIRTH CENTER,

03:48.699 --> 03:53.404
THERE ARE CERTAIN CONVERSATIONS
YOU EXPECT TO HEAR...

03:53.404 --> 03:56.867
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE MAGIC
OF A CHANGING BODY...

03:56.867 --> 03:59.470
LOOK AT ME. I'M A COW.

03:59.470 --> 04:02.273
THE BEAUTY
OF NATURAL CHILDBIRTH.

04:02.273 --> 04:05.676
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I'M GETTING THE DRUGS.

04:05.676 --> 04:08.849
OR THE IMPORTANCE
OF HEALTHY NUTRITION.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.282
TAKE A CHIP, LOSE A HAND.

04:11.282 --> 04:15.426
BUT JULIE MEYER FOUND HERSELF
HAVING A CONVERSATION...

04:15.426 --> 04:18.389
I CAN'T BELIEVE BREE'S
ON TRIAL FOR MURDER.

04:18.389 --> 04:21.892
I MEAN, COME ON.
KILLERS DON'T WEAR APRONS.

04:21.892 --> 04:24.895
THAT WAS RATHER UNEXPECTED.

04:24.895 --> 04:27.468
I KNOW. IT SUCKS.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE SUCKS?

04:27.468 --> 04:30.401
SOMEBODY TRYING TO RELAX YOU
BY TALKING ABOUT A MURDER.

04:30.401 --> 04:32.903
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

04:32.903 --> 04:35.306
SO WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING
FOR YOU TO VISUALIZE

04:35.306 --> 04:37.277
THAT MIGHT HELP RELAX YOU?

04:37.277 --> 04:40.411
ME PUNCHING PORTER IN THE FACE
FOR BEING LATE.

04:40.411 --> 04:44.385
OKAY. FORGET VISUALIZATION.
HOW ABOUT WE TRY

04:44.385 --> 04:45.456
SOME OF THAT BREATHING STUFF
AGAIN?

04:45.456 --> 04:48.559
UGH. NO.
I HATE THAT "HEE-HEE-HEE."

04:48.559 --> 04:49.590
FEELS STUPID.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.592
I KNOW. BUT IT WORKS.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.564
RELAXES YOU WHEN YOU START
TO GET STRESSED OUT.

04:53.564 --> 04:55.496
OKAY, NICE JOB, EVERYONE.

04:55.496 --> 04:58.669
WE'RE GONNA SHOW
THE BIRTHING DVD NOW.

04:58.669 --> 05:03.374
JULIE, SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.

05:03.374 --> 05:05.676
I HAD TO CLEAN OUT THE FRYER
BEFORE I COULD LEAVE.

05:05.676 --> 05:07.538
NO WORRIES. PLUS YOU SMELL
LIKE FRENCH FRIES.

05:07.538 --> 05:09.309
I LOVE FRENCH FRIES.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.782
(man) IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT
TO GO THROUGH...

05:11.782 --> 05:13.083
YOU MISSED, LIKE,
THE WHOLE CLASS.

05:13.083 --> 05:16.447
SHE DID GREAT. LET ME TELL YOU,
THIS GIRL CAN VISUALIZE.

05:16.447 --> 05:18.489
I PLANNED ON GETTING OUT EARLY,
BUT A SHIFT OPENED UP,

05:18.489 --> 05:20.491
AND I HAD TO TAKE IT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

05:20.491 --> 05:21.852
I WANT YOU TO SAY
THAT YOU'LL BE ON TIME

05:21.852 --> 05:24.495
FOR ONE THING WE DO AS WE GET
READY TO HAVE THIS BABY.

05:24.495 --> 05:25.996
"HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE."

05:25.996 --> 05:27.658
IT'S NOT FUNNY,
MRS. DELFINO.

05:27.658 --> 05:30.601
LOOK. I SAID I'M SORRY.

05:30.601 --> 05:31.902
THE POINT IS, I'M HERE NOW,

05:31.902 --> 05:34.334
AND I'M 100% FOCUSED
AND READY TO HELP.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.636
JUST STAY CALM.

05:35.636 --> 05:36.967
...THE CROWNING BEGINS,

05:36.967 --> 05:39.039
AND THE HEAD OF THE BABY
BECOMES VISIBLE.

05:39.039 --> 05:43.514
AAH!

05:43.514 --> 05:44.845
(thud)

05:44.845 --> 05:46.977
AAH!

05:49.850 --> 05:53.353
HELLO. THIS IS BREE VAN DE KAMP.
MAY I PLEASE SPEAK WITH TRIP?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.556
OH. WAS HE HAVING LUNCH ALONE?

05:57.488 --> 06:01.692
OH, RIGHT. THE BLONDE WOMAN
WITH THE CONVERTIBLE.

06:01.692 --> 06:03.934
I SEE. RIGHT.

06:03.934 --> 06:05.396
THANK YOU.

06:05.396 --> 06:07.367
(beep)

06:07.367 --> 06:08.869
(sighs)

06:08.869 --> 06:10.370
OKAY, I KNOW THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF TALK

06:10.370 --> 06:12.372
ABOUT WHAT YOU SHOULD WEAR
TO THE TRIAL,

06:12.372 --> 06:15.976
SO I'VE SELECTED A FEW OUTFITS
THAT JUST SCREAM "ACQUITTAL."

06:15.976 --> 06:17.448
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:17.448 --> 06:19.650
BLACK AND WHITE STRIPES?

06:19.650 --> 06:22.713
OH, GOOD POINT. DON'T NEED TO
PUT AN IDEA IN THE JURY'S MIND.

06:22.713 --> 06:24.415
HOW ABOUT RUFFLES?
I READ SOMEWHERE

06:24.415 --> 06:26.787
THAT NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN
CONVICTED WHILE WEARING RUFFLES.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.759
WELL--
 OKAY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:28.759 --> 06:31.061
THERE'S ALWAYS A FIRST TIME.
TO HELL WITH RUFFLES.

06:31.061 --> 06:32.593
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

06:32.593 --> 06:35.426
IT'S LOVELY, BUT I AM
BEING ACCUSED OF SLEEPING

06:35.426 --> 06:37.468
WITH A TOTAL STRANGER
AND KILLING HIM.

06:37.468 --> 06:41.872
AND RED IS THE COLOR
OF BLOOD AND WHORES. GOT IT.

06:41.872 --> 06:45.836
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL FIND SOMETHING ELSE.

06:48.439 --> 06:49.580
BREE, SOMETHING WRONG?

06:49.580 --> 06:53.444
APART FROM ME STANDING TRIAL
FOR MURDER IN THREE DAYS, NO.

06:53.444 --> 06:54.985
LIFE IS GOOD.

06:54.985 --> 06:57.888
RELAX. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

06:57.888 --> 07:00.491
AND REMEMBER,
YOU'RE ACTUALLY INNOCENT.

07:00.491 --> 07:02.052
JURIES CAN SENSE
THINGS LIKE THAT.

07:02.052 --> 07:04.525
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.
 OF COURSE I AM.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.596
AND TRIP'S
A BRILLIANT LAWYER.

07:05.596 --> 07:07.598
HE'S GONNA GET YOU OFF
IN NO TIME.

07:07.598 --> 07:10.461
I'M JUST WORRIED THAT HE'S BEEN
A LITTLE DISTRACTED LATELY.

07:10.461 --> 07:12.503
HE SEEMS FINE TO ME.

07:12.503 --> 07:13.504
I HAVE SOME OTHER DRESSES
IN THE BACK.

07:13.504 --> 07:17.568
LET ME BRING 'EM OUT
FOR YOU.

07:17.568 --> 07:19.540
IT'S GONNA TURN OUT FINE,
BREE.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.672
HONESTLY, I'M NOT WORRIED
AT ALL.

07:28.078 --> 07:29.480
INDIA?

07:29.480 --> 07:31.622
NOT INDIA.
HE SAID HE'S GOING TO MUMBAI.

07:31.622 --> 07:33.554
THAT'S IN INDIA,
YOU IDIOT.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.026
(Penny) HOW LONG
ARE YOU GONNA BE GONE?
 A YEAR.

07:36.026 --> 07:39.590
WHAT? DAD, YOU'RE GONNA MISS
MY EIGHTH GRADE GRADUATION.

07:39.590 --> 07:41.231
IT WON'T BE SO BAD.
WE CAN SEND HIM PICTURES.

07:41.231 --> 07:42.933
WE CAN SKYPE.

07:42.933 --> 07:44.535
SO HE'S SUPPOSED TO TEACH ME
TO DRIVE OVER THE COMPUTER?

07:44.535 --> 07:46.066
AND HE'S GONNA MISS
THE BIRTH OF MY BABY.

07:46.066 --> 07:49.700
I AM SORRY, GUYS.
LOOK, I TALKED TO MY BOSS.

07:49.700 --> 07:52.172
HE'S NOT CHANGING HIS MIND.
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.804
BESIDES, IT'S--
IT'S JUST FOR A YEAR.

07:53.804 --> 07:55.576
IT'LL GO BY LIKE THAT.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.548
DADDY, NO!

07:57.548 --> 07:59.580
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.481
(Tom) I KNOW.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, BABY.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.013
(sighs)

08:03.013 --> 08:04.785
(crying)

08:04.785 --> 08:07.958
GUYS, COULD I HAVE A MINUTE
ALONE WITH YOUR DAD?

08:07.958 --> 08:09.089
YEAH, SURE.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.221
(chuckles)
GUYS, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

08:11.221 --> 08:14.194
WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS!

08:14.194 --> 08:16.597
(lowered voice) I DON'T KNOW HOW
WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.

08:18.529 --> 08:20.170
SO HOW DID JANE
TAKE THE NEWS?

08:20.170 --> 08:22.773
UM, TIMING
COULD'VE BEEN BETTER.

08:22.773 --> 08:25.075
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY
IN A GOOD PLACE RIGHT NOW.

08:27.678 --> 08:29.980
WELL, MAYBE SOME TIME APART
WILL DO YOU GOOD.

08:29.980 --> 08:31.712
(clatter)

08:31.712 --> 08:33.212
HMM. MAYBE.

08:33.212 --> 08:36.547
IT'S GONNA BE...

08:36.547 --> 08:39.890
REALLY WEIRD
BEING SO FAR AWAY.

08:39.890 --> 08:42.993
I KNOW. IT'S GONNA BE
SO HARD ON THE KIDS.

08:42.993 --> 08:46.557
ACTUALLY, I WAS TALKING
ABOUT YOU.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.831
I DON'T THINK
WE'VE EVER BEEN APART

08:50.831 --> 08:52.833
FOR MORE THAN A MONTH.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.165
WHO'S GONNA TELL ME
WHAT TO DO?

08:55.165 --> 08:56.637
WHAT TO THINK?

08:56.637 --> 09:00.671
HMM. WHETHER YOUR SHOES
ARE ON THE RIGHT FEET.

09:00.671 --> 09:02.713
EXACTLY.

09:03.914 --> 09:06.546
I'M REALLY GONNA MISS YOU.

09:10.220 --> 09:11.652
I'M...

09:11.652 --> 09:13.924
(sighs)

09:13.924 --> 09:17.087
SO SORRY.

09:17.087 --> 09:19.059
WHY?

09:19.059 --> 09:20.791
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

09:29.740 --> 09:31.201
(sighs)

09:40.280 --> 09:41.912
(gasps) HELLO.

09:44.354 --> 09:46.086
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR TRIP?

09:46.086 --> 09:49.359
YES.
 WELL, HE'S MEETING
WITH THE JUDGE ON MY CASE.

09:49.359 --> 09:50.791
I'LL WAIT FOR HIM.

09:57.898 --> 10:01.001
SO HOW EXACTLY
DO YOU KNOW TRIP?

10:01.001 --> 10:04.835
HE... HIRES ME
FROM TIME TO TIME.

10:04.835 --> 10:08.008
AND WHAT IS THE NATURE
OF YOUR WORK?

10:08.008 --> 10:09.640
I REALLY CAN'T SAY.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.982
DISCRETION'S AN IMPORTANT
PART OF MY JOB.

10:11.982 --> 10:15.115
OH. I SEE.
WELL, PART OF YOUR DISCRETION

10:15.115 --> 10:17.718
IS FALLING
OUT OF YOUR BLOUSE.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.990
EXCUSE ME?
 LOOK, THIS IS MR. WESTON'S
PLACE OF BUSINESS.

10:19.990 --> 10:22.993
MAYBE YOU SHOULD MEET HIM
IN YOUR PLACE OF BUSINESS--

10:22.993 --> 10:26.156
PERHAPS A SEEDY MOTEL ROOM
OR A STREET CORNER.

10:26.156 --> 10:28.328
ARE YOU CALLING ME A HOOKER?

10:28.328 --> 10:31.832
WELL, IF THE PUSH-UP BRA FITS,
OR IN YOUR CASE, DOESN'T...

10:31.832 --> 10:33.964
THAT'S IT.
SCREW YOU, LADY.

10:33.964 --> 10:36.006
TELL TRIP
I'M OFF HIS CASE.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.770
LINDSAY. LINDSAY.

10:39.770 --> 10:41.041
TRIP?
 WHAT THE HELL?

10:41.041 --> 10:45.275
UH, SHE WANTED ME TO TELL YOU
THAT SHE'S OFF THE CASE.

10:45.275 --> 10:47.017
WHAT WAS SHE DOING
 ON THE CASE?

10:47.017 --> 10:48.418
SHE'S A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR

10:48.418 --> 10:51.651
WHO WAS WORKING ON
A REALLY BIG LEAD FOR US.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.654
WH-WHY DID SHE QUIT?

10:54.654 --> 10:55.986
NO IDEA.

10:55.986 --> 10:59.029
(sighs) I'D BETTER GO
TALK TO HER.

10:59.029 --> 11:02.162
NO! I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW CAREFUL
YOU HAVE TO BE WITH SOME WOMEN.

11:02.162 --> 11:06.336
THEY CAN MISINTERPRET
THE LITTLEST THINGS.

11:06.336 --> 11:08.268
I'LL TALK TO HER.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.175
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK,
MAID OF HONOR?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.708
(gulps) NICE. (clears throat)

11:17.708 --> 11:20.210
YOU DO REALIZE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO WEAR THIS... IN PUBLIC?

11:20.210 --> 11:21.852
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH IT?

11:21.852 --> 11:26.686
NO. IT'S JUST... THE PURPLE
IS SUCH A... BOLD CHOICE.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.419
AREN'T YOU AFRAID IT'S GONNA
PULL FOCUS FROM THE BRIDE?

11:29.419 --> 11:31.762
AND THE SKY AND THE EARTH?

11:31.762 --> 11:33.864
(sighs) LEE,
LOOK AT MY WEDDING DRESS.

11:33.864 --> 11:37.267
ALL OF THIS WEARING
ALL OF THAT--

11:37.267 --> 11:39.930
SANTA CLAUS IN A THONG
RIDING A UNICORN

11:39.930 --> 11:42.833
WOULD NOT BE ABLE
TO PULL FOCUS FROM ME.

11:42.833 --> 11:44.174
LYNETTE, YOU OKAY?
YOU SEEM A LITTLE...

11:44.174 --> 11:45.705
DISTRACTED.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.937
I THINK SHE'S STILL
IN SHOCK.

11:46.937 --> 11:51.181
NO, IT'S JUST...
THIS WHOLE THING WITH TOM.

11:51.181 --> 11:53.043
OH, LYNETTE,
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

11:53.043 --> 11:56.086
MY DAD TRAVELED ALL THE TIME.
MY SIBLINGS AND I ADJUSTED.

11:56.086 --> 11:59.289
YEAH, BUT HE SAID
HE WAS GONNA MISS ME.

11:59.289 --> 12:02.823
REALLY? SUDDENLY I'M INTERESTED.
THAT'S GREAT.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.125
AND IT WAS THE WAY HE SAID IT,
TOO, LIKE...

12:05.125 --> 12:08.999
HE'D BEEN KIND OF MISSING ME
ALREADY.

12:08.999 --> 12:11.101
WELL,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

12:11.101 --> 12:12.362
(laughs) I DON'T KNOW.

12:12.362 --> 12:14.464
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN LET HIM
GET ON THAT PLANE TO MUMBAI.

12:14.464 --> 12:18.168
OR EAT THESE IF YOU'RE
GOING TO FIT IN THAT DRESS.

12:18.168 --> 12:20.010
(crunches)

12:20.010 --> 12:21.912
(birds chirping)

12:21.912 --> 12:23.774
LINDSAY! HI.

12:23.774 --> 12:27.047
I THINK WE GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT EARLIER.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.820
(lowered voice) KEEP WALKING.
 I SUPPOSE I DESERVE THAT,
BUT IF I COULD JUST HAVE A--

12:29.820 --> 12:30.951
AAH!

12:30.951 --> 12:33.253
I'M ON SURVEILLANCE!
STAY DOWN.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.086
OOH, HOW EXCITING.
WHAT ARE WE SURVEILLING?

12:36.086 --> 12:41.061
(groans) WELL, NOTHING NOW.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.893
I'VE BEEN WAITING SIX WEEKS
FOR THAT CHEATING BASTARD

12:42.893 --> 12:44.264
TO LEAVE HIS CURTAINS OPEN.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.136
I'M SORRY.

12:46.136 --> 12:48.098
(sighs) TRIP TOLD ME
WHERE TO FIND YOU,

12:48.098 --> 12:52.142
BECAUSE I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR MY UNKIND WORDS.

12:52.142 --> 12:55.345
YOU WERE MERELY DOING YOUR JOB,
AND I WAS VERY RUDE.

12:55.345 --> 12:57.207
WELL, YOU WERE MORE
THAN RUDE.

12:57.207 --> 12:59.249
YES, I WAS ALSO OFF-COLOR.

12:59.249 --> 13:01.982
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE...
IMPLIED YOU'RE A HOOKER

13:01.982 --> 13:04.154
OR INSULTED YOUR BOSOMS.

13:04.154 --> 13:05.255
THEY'RE LOVELY.

13:05.255 --> 13:06.316
NO.
 (zips bag)

13:06.316 --> 13:10.160
NOT THAT. (sighs)
YOU LIKE HIM.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.922
YOU THOUGHT I WAS
SLEEPING WITH HIM,

13:11.922 --> 13:13.463
AND YOU GOT JEALOUS.

13:13.463 --> 13:16.266
I'M NOT JEALOUS
OF YOU AND TRIP.

13:16.266 --> 13:17.427
IS THERE A "YOU AND TRIP"?

13:17.427 --> 13:19.529
OH, GOD, NO.
HE'S, LIKE, 100.

13:19.529 --> 13:22.372
LOOK, I'LL COME BACK
TO YOUR CASE,

13:22.372 --> 13:25.205
AND I'LL GIVE YOU A FREE PASS
ON THE CRAZY JEALOUSY.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.176
IT'S NOT ALL YOUR FAULT.

13:28.378 --> 13:30.280
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
 TRIP'S A GOOD LAWYER.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.811
HE LISTENS CAREFULLY.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.243
HE TELLS YOU
HE'LL PROTECT YOU.

13:33.243 --> 13:36.186
FEMALE CLIENTS ARE ALWAYS
GETTING THE WRONG IDEA.

13:36.186 --> 13:38.288
(sighs)

13:38.288 --> 13:40.450
WELL, THAT MIGHT BE THE WAY
IT NORMALLY GOES,

13:40.450 --> 13:42.352
BUT I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE
THERE REALLY IS SOMETHING

13:42.352 --> 13:44.194
BETWEEN TRIP AND ME.

13:44.194 --> 13:47.958
SORRY, BUT I KNOW HIM.
HE'S ALL ABOUT THE JOB.

13:47.958 --> 13:50.200
HE'S INTO YOUR CASE,
 NOT YOU.

13:53.603 --> 13:57.037
PORTER IS GOING TO BE FINE.
TRUST ME.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.239
OH, SURE.
HE'LL JUST WEAR A HELMET

13:59.239 --> 14:00.340
SO HE DOESN'T
CRACK HIS HEAD OPEN

14:00.340 --> 14:02.512
WHEN HIS HEAD HITS
THE DELIVERY ROOM FLOOR.

14:02.512 --> 14:04.975
BABY, I'M TELLING YOU,

14:04.975 --> 14:09.579
WHEN THE MAN GETS IN THERE
WITH YOU, IT JUST CLICKS.

14:09.579 --> 14:11.551
THEY SEE
THE BLOOD AND STUFF,

14:11.551 --> 14:14.955
AND IT STARTS TO SEEM
LIKE A VIDEO GAME TO THEM.

14:16.426 --> 14:19.329
I'M GETTING A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS.

14:21.031 --> 14:24.294
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:24.294 --> 14:27.237
MIKE ALMOST PASSED OUT
WHEN HE SAW THAT VIDEO.

14:27.237 --> 14:30.440
AND HE WAS A LITTLE SHAKY
IN THE DELIVERY ROOM, TOO.

14:30.440 --> 14:33.273
BUT ONCE M.J. WAS BORN,

14:33.273 --> 14:35.305
HE WAS MY ROCK.

14:37.978 --> 14:43.383
M.J. TOOK HIS FIRST STEP
RIGHT THERE.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.515
WE WERE SO EXCITED.

14:45.515 --> 14:48.458
THEN HE TOOK HIS SECOND STEP
RIGHT THERE.

14:48.458 --> 14:50.290
FELL RIGHT ON HIS FACE.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.893
HE WAS... BLEEDING AND...

14:53.893 --> 14:57.367
I WAS A MESS.

14:57.367 --> 15:00.370
AND MIKE KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT TO DO.

15:03.133 --> 15:04.434
HE ALWAYS DID.

15:04.434 --> 15:06.236
OH, MOM.

15:09.309 --> 15:12.642
(sighs) I'M OKAY.

15:15.185 --> 15:19.149
JUST SO MANY MEMORIES
OF HIM HERE.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.293
ANYWAY... (chuckles)

15:23.293 --> 15:25.295
THE POINT IS...

15:25.295 --> 15:27.027
(sniffles)

15:27.027 --> 15:31.401
YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT PORTER.

15:31.401 --> 15:33.303
I JUST...

15:33.303 --> 15:36.636
I THINK THAT HE'S NOT
INTO THIS ANYMORE.

15:38.068 --> 15:40.440
THAT HE'S LOSING INTEREST
IN BEING A DAD.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.272
HE WAS LATE FOR CLASS
BECAUSE OF WORK.

15:42.272 --> 15:43.513
YOU GOTTA CUT HIM
SOME SLACK.

15:43.513 --> 15:45.245
IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.447
HE'S MISSED
SOME DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS,

15:47.447 --> 15:49.649
AND HE MISSED THE TOUR
OF THE BIRTHING ROOM

15:49.649 --> 15:52.082
AT THE HOSPITAL.

15:52.082 --> 15:54.254
WE HAD A DEAL.
HE WAS SUPPOSED

15:54.254 --> 15:56.386
TO HELP RAISE THE BABY
SO THAT I COULD FINISH SCHOOL.

15:56.386 --> 15:59.459
BUT NOW I'M AFRAID THAT

15:59.459 --> 16:02.192
IT'S ALL FALLING APART.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.472
THAT WAS DELICIOUS.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.344
I'M GLAD YOU LIKED IT.

16:14.344 --> 16:15.645
(clears throat) MORE WINE?

16:15.645 --> 16:18.378
(sighs) LYNETTE,
IT'S OUR THIRD DATE.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.250
I'M PRETTY MUCH
A SURE THING.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.382
(chuckles)

16:22.382 --> 16:24.184
SOMETHING WRONG?
YOU'RE ACTING A LITTLE WEIRD.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.385
YEAH, THERE'S...
 (bottle clatters)

16:25.385 --> 16:29.159
I HAVE A LITTLE FAVOR
TO ASK YOU.

16:29.159 --> 16:32.362
PLEASE, DON'T SEND TOM
TO MUMBAI.

16:32.362 --> 16:36.526
YOU HAVE A VERY ODD
SENSE OF FOREPLAY.

16:36.526 --> 16:38.168
I KNOW. IT'S JUST...

16:38.168 --> 16:40.570
THE KIDS ARE UPSET,
AND TOM IS A WRECK,

16:40.570 --> 16:43.073
AND I DON'T THINK
I CAN GO THROUGH WITH IT.

16:43.073 --> 16:45.405
OKAY.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.077
REALLY?

16:47.077 --> 16:49.139
YEAH. I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO GO.
I WAS JUST DOING IT FOR YOU.

16:49.139 --> 16:51.181
I'LL SEND McGUINNESS
INSTEAD.

16:51.181 --> 16:52.282
THAT SON OF A BITCH
HAD THE NERVE

16:52.282 --> 16:54.114
TO BEAT ME IN TENNIS
LAST WEEK.

16:54.114 --> 16:57.247
OH. THANK YOU.

16:57.247 --> 17:00.620
I AM SO GRATEFUL.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.322
WELL...

17:02.322 --> 17:04.294
I CAN THINK OF ONE WAY

17:04.294 --> 17:05.355
THAT YOU CAN SHOW
YOUR GRATITUDE.

17:05.355 --> 17:07.357
MM.
 WHOA.

17:07.357 --> 17:10.329
UM, MAYBE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO NEEDS ANOTHER GLASS OF WINE.
 (glass clatters)

17:10.329 --> 17:12.362
GREGG. NO.

17:12.362 --> 17:13.762
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:13.762 --> 17:17.406
I JUST... I'M NOT READY
FOR THAT STEP,

17:17.406 --> 17:19.509
AND I DON'T KNOW
THAT I EVER WILL BE.

17:19.509 --> 17:21.271
EVER?

17:21.271 --> 17:23.613
I'M SORRY.
THERE'S... SOMEONE ELSE.

17:23.613 --> 17:26.276
YOU JUST REALIZED THAT?

17:26.276 --> 17:31.321
NO. NO, I JUST REALIZED
HOW MUCH I WANT IT TO WORK.

17:31.321 --> 17:32.452
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.454
YOU USE ME TO GET BACK
AT YOUR EX,

17:34.454 --> 17:36.326
AND NOW YOU'RE DUMPING ME
FOR SOME OTHER GUY?

17:36.326 --> 17:38.228
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE!

17:38.228 --> 17:41.461
UNBELIEVABLE.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.463
(door opens)

17:43.463 --> 17:44.394
(door slams)

17:55.505 --> 18:00.650
(teakettle whistles)

18:00.650 --> 18:02.612
(man on TV) AND IN LOCAL NEWS,

18:02.612 --> 18:06.416
THE TRIAL OF BREE VAN DE KAMP
IS SET TO BEGIN TOMORROW.

18:06.416 --> 18:09.489
VAN DE KAMP IS ACCUSED
OF KILLING RAMON SANCHEZ,

18:09.489 --> 18:10.520
WHOSE BODY WAS DISCOVERED

18:10.520 --> 18:12.392
BENEATH
A CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENT

18:12.392 --> 18:14.424
IN CHAPMAN WOODS.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.399
HEY. COULDN'T SLEEP?

18:19.399 --> 18:21.431
HEY. NO.

18:21.431 --> 18:22.402
HUH.

18:22.402 --> 18:26.336
THOUGHT I'D TAKE A WALK.

18:26.336 --> 18:30.380
REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
WE WERE UP THIS LATE TOGETHER?

18:30.380 --> 18:33.513
THE NIGHT
WE BURIED ALEJANDRO.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.785
GOD, IF WE COULD
ONLY GO BACK.

18:35.785 --> 18:38.388
(exhales deeply)

18:38.388 --> 18:40.490
HEY.

18:40.490 --> 18:42.352
YOU HAVING TROUBLE SLEEPING,
TOO?

18:42.352 --> 18:43.393
NO, I WOKE UP
TO GET SOME WATER,

18:43.393 --> 18:44.824
AND I SAW YOU
FROM THE WINDOW.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.156
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING UP?

18:46.156 --> 18:48.328
WE CAN'T SLEEP
BECAUSE OUR FRIEND

18:48.328 --> 18:50.630
IS GOING ON TRIAL
TOMORROW MORNING FOR MURDER.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.663
OH, RELAX. BREE'S INNOCENT.
THE JURY'S GONNA SEE THAT.

18:53.663 --> 18:55.705
JURIES MAKE MISTAKES.

18:55.705 --> 18:57.407
(sighs) WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT DOESN'T HELP BREE

18:57.407 --> 18:58.708
FOR US TO BE NEGATIVE
RIGHT NOW.

18:58.708 --> 19:02.742
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING
WE SHOULD DO TO HELP HER?

19:02.742 --> 19:04.914
GO TO THE JUDGE
AND TELL HER THE TRUTH.

19:04.914 --> 19:07.217
I WAS THINKING
THE EXACT SAME THING.

19:07.217 --> 19:09.249
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

19:09.249 --> 19:11.451
WHAT, IT NEVER EVEN
CROSSED YOUR MIND?

19:11.451 --> 19:13.383
WELL, WE HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE,

19:13.383 --> 19:15.685
AND IF WE JUST HOLD ON
A LITTLE LONGER,

19:15.685 --> 19:17.387
EVERYTHING WILL BE BACK
TO NORMAL.

19:17.387 --> 19:18.858
AND WHAT IF BREE
IS CONVICTED, HUH?

19:18.858 --> 19:20.330
WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO THEN?

19:20.330 --> 19:21.561
I DON'T KNOW.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.162
CLEARLY.
DO YOU EVEN CARE?

19:23.162 --> 19:24.163
LYNETTE!

19:24.163 --> 19:27.267
OKAY. IT'S LATE.

19:27.267 --> 19:30.640
(sighs) WELL, LET'S JUST
TALK ABOUT IT TOMORROW.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.805
WELL, I DON'T GET THIS.
WHY ARE YOU GUYS MAD AT ME?

19:35.805 --> 19:39.449
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT HAVING
ANY TROUBLE SLEEPING.

19:49.419 --> 19:50.760
(knock on door)

19:50.760 --> 19:53.763
(Trip) DON'T FREAK OUT.
IT'S JUST ME.

19:57.467 --> 19:59.198
TRIP, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

19:59.198 --> 20:00.330
IT'S THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT.

20:00.330 --> 20:02.502
I HAD A FEELING
YOU MIGHT BE UP.

20:04.434 --> 20:07.437
(sighs)

20:07.437 --> 20:09.439
DO WE NEED TO DISCUSS
MY CASE?

20:09.439 --> 20:11.441
NOPE. JUST THE OPPOSITE.

20:11.441 --> 20:13.913
DOUGHNUTS...
"CASABLANCA."

20:13.913 --> 20:15.385
THAT'S ONE
OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES.

20:15.385 --> 20:17.317
YOURS, TOO?
 NEVER SEEN IT.

20:17.317 --> 20:22.552
I'M, UH, MORE A "CADDYSHACK"
KIND OF GUY.

20:22.552 --> 20:24.254
BUT I HAD A FEELING
ABOUT YOU.

20:24.254 --> 20:25.625
UM, MAY I?
 SURE.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.896
HERE.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.460
MY TRIAL STARTS
IN SIX HOURS.

20:30.460 --> 20:32.332
IS THIS REALLY
WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING?

20:32.332 --> 20:34.764
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT SPORTS?

20:34.764 --> 20:36.736
NO MORE THAN I HAVE TO.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.938
THIS IS JUST LIKE
GOING TO THE CHAMPIONSHIPS.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.470
YOU PRACTICE YOUR ASS OFF
TO GET THERE,

20:40.470 --> 20:42.942
BUT THE NIGHT
BEFORE THE BIG GAME,

20:42.942 --> 20:44.644
YOU JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

20:44.644 --> 20:47.547
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M GOING THROUGH THIS.

20:47.547 --> 20:50.450
BUT IF I HAVE TO...

20:50.450 --> 20:51.821
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

20:51.821 --> 20:53.753
OF ALL THE GIN JOINTS
IN ALL THE TOWNS

20:53.753 --> 20:55.925
IN ALL THE WORLD,

20:55.925 --> 20:57.857
I'M GLAD YOU WALKED
INTO MINE.

20:57.857 --> 21:00.430
AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

21:00.430 --> 21:02.832
START THE MOVIE.

21:06.796 --> 21:08.368
THANK YOU.

21:18.007 --> 21:21.010
(indistinct conversations)

21:22.512 --> 21:23.953
(gavel bangs)

21:23.953 --> 21:27.617
IN THE MATTER OF
 PEOPLE vs. BREE VAN DE KAMP,

21:27.617 --> 21:29.489
WE ARE HERE
FOR OPENING STATEMENTS.

21:29.489 --> 21:32.892
MS. STONE, YOU MAY PROCEED.

21:35.925 --> 21:38.768
HOW WELL DO WE REALLY KNOW
OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS?

21:38.768 --> 21:42.432
THEY BORROW OUR LAWN MOWERS,
SIT WITH US IN P.T.A. MEETINGS,

21:42.432 --> 21:43.903
BRING US TUNA CASSEROLES.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.576
BUT AS THIS CASE
WILL DEMONSTRATE,

21:46.576 --> 21:48.808
THEY ALSO HAVE SECRETS--

21:48.808 --> 21:51.741
SECRETS THEY KEEP
FROM THEIR NEIGHBORS,

21:51.741 --> 21:55.745
SECRETS THAT CAN POISON
A PLACE LIKE WISTERIA LANE.

21:55.745 --> 21:59.919
(Trip) MS. STONE WONDERS
HOW WELL WE KNOW OUR NEIGHBORS.

21:59.919 --> 22:02.452
WELL, IN THIS CASE,
AS IT TURNS OUT,

22:02.452 --> 22:03.693
PRETTY DARN WELL.

22:03.693 --> 22:05.895
BREEN VAN DE KAMP'S FRIENDS
WILL TELL YOU

22:05.895 --> 22:10.900
THAT SHE IS A WOMAN OF HONESTY,
INTEGRITY, AND COMPASSION.

22:10.900 --> 22:12.632
(Ms. Stone) BREE VAN DE KAMP
IS AN ALCOHOLIC,

22:12.632 --> 22:15.064
A WOMAN OF LOOSE MORALS.

22:15.064 --> 22:19.068
SHE WOULD PICK UP STRANGE MEN
IN BARS,

22:19.068 --> 22:20.970
HAVE SEX WITH THEM,

22:20.970 --> 22:23.012
FREQUENTLY WAKING UP
WITH NO RECOLLECTION

22:23.012 --> 22:24.914
OF WHAT HAPPENED.

22:24.914 --> 22:28.578
IF PICKING UP PEOPLE IN BARS
IS A CRIME,

22:28.578 --> 22:32.051
THERE MIGHT BE A CRIMINAL OR TWO
IN THIS VERY COURTROOM.

22:32.051 --> 22:36.826
(jury chuckles)
 THE DEFENDANT LURED
RAMON SANCHEZ INTO HER HOUSE,

22:36.826 --> 22:39.128
SEDUCED HIM,
AND BLUDGEONED HIM.

22:39.128 --> 22:40.930
THERE IS NO CONNECTION
WHATSOEVER

22:40.930 --> 22:43.893
BETWEEN MY CLIENT
AND MR. SANCHEZ.

22:43.893 --> 22:46.065
AND WHILE IT ISN'T AGAINST
THE LAW TO SLEEP WITH ANY MAN

22:46.065 --> 22:49.999
WHO'D BUY YOU A MARTINI,
IT IS ILLEGAL TO KILL THEM.

22:49.999 --> 22:53.573
(Trip) HAS BREE MADE
SOME QUESTIONABLE CHOICES? YES.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.975
DOES THAT MAKE HER A KILLER?

22:55.975 --> 22:57.647
NO.

22:57.647 --> 23:01.380
IT MAKES HER HUMAN...
LIKE THE REST OF US.

23:01.380 --> 23:05.815
THIS IS A CASE ABOUT A WOMAN
WHO LED A SECRET LIFE,

23:05.815 --> 23:07.717
BUT HERE'S THE THING
ABOUT SECRETS.

23:07.717 --> 23:12.492
LIKE BODIES,
THEY DON'T ALWAYS STAY BURIED.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.967
WELCOME TO BIG TOP BURGER.

23:17.967 --> 23:19.569
HI. I'M LOOKING
FOR PORTER SCAVO.

23:19.569 --> 23:20.830
IS HE DONE YET?

23:20.830 --> 23:22.972
NO, PORTER'S WORKING
THE DRIVE-THRU.

23:22.972 --> 23:25.575
(bags rustle)

23:25.575 --> 23:28.538
OH. I THOUGHT HE WAS ONLY
WORKING TILL 1:00.

23:28.538 --> 23:30.139
WELL, I HEARD HIM SAY
HE'D COVER THE AFTERNOON SHIFT,

23:30.139 --> 23:31.541
SO THAT'S TILL 6:00.

23:31.541 --> 23:33.613
NOW CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT?

23:33.613 --> 23:37.817
NO, I THINK I'LL GET
SOMETHING TO GO.

23:39.589 --> 23:41.991
(Porter) Welcome to
Big Top Burger. Can I help you?

23:41.991 --> 23:43.453
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.

23:43.453 --> 23:46.055
HOW ABOUT YOU HELP
THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILD?

23:46.055 --> 23:47.627
Mrs. Delfino?

23:47.627 --> 23:49.529
DEAR GOD.
IS THERE ANOTHER PERSON

23:49.529 --> 23:51.430
WHO COULD SAY
WHAT I JUST SAID TO YOU?

23:51.430 --> 23:52.832
No, of course not.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.063
PORTER,
WHY ARE YOU MAKING JULIE

23:54.063 --> 23:56.666
DO ALL OF THIS STUFF
WITHOUT YOU?

23:56.666 --> 23:58.107
I'm busting my butt
trying to make money

23:58.107 --> 24:01.010
for her and the baby.
I'm working three jobs.

24:01.010 --> 24:02.912
WELL, THEN TELL HER THAT.

24:02.912 --> 24:06.175
SHE'S WORRIED THAT YOU'RE LOSING
INTEREST IN BEING A DAD. OH.
 (horn honk)

24:06.175 --> 24:09.148
I'M TALKING TO THE CLOWN!
SHUT UP!

24:09.148 --> 24:11.120
Can you please pull up
to the window?

24:11.120 --> 24:14.724
(sighs)
 (shifts gears)

24:16.986 --> 24:19.859
(sighs) LOOK, MRS. DELFINO,

24:19.859 --> 24:21.891
I BARELY GRADUATED
HIGH SCHOOL,

24:21.891 --> 24:24.133
I DITCHED COLLEGE,
AND THIS IS ABOUT AS MUCH

24:24.133 --> 24:26.536
AS MY BABY'S DADDY
IS GONNA ACHIEVE.

24:26.536 --> 24:29.068
YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK
TO COLLEGE.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.199
WHEN?

24:30.199 --> 24:32.041
EVERYBODY SAYS HOW EXPENSIVE
IT IS TO HAVE A KID.

24:32.041 --> 24:35.805
WITH THE CRAP MONEY I MAKE,
I'LL BE WORKING ALL THE TIME.

24:35.805 --> 24:37.547
LOOK, I GET IT.

24:37.547 --> 24:40.910
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT FOR JULIE
TO DO THIS WITHOUT YOU.

24:40.910 --> 24:44.183
I TOTALLY AGREE.
JULIE'S GIVEN UP SO MUCH

24:44.183 --> 24:46.556
SO I CAN BE
IN THIS KID'S LIFE.

24:46.556 --> 24:50.660
BUT I'M STARTING TO REALIZE...
THAT WAS A BAD TRADE FOR HER.

24:57.066 --> 24:59.168
LOOK AT HER,
A REGULAR BLACK WIDOW.

24:59.168 --> 25:02.271
IT SAYS HERE SHE SLEPT WITH
15 GUYS IN A 2-MONTH PERIOD.

25:02.271 --> 25:04.033
AND SHE WAS DRUNK
THE WHOLE TIME.

25:04.033 --> 25:07.136
SOUNDS LIKE COLLEGE.
 (laughs)

25:07.136 --> 25:09.208
EXCUSE ME. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.581
DO YOU EVEN KNOW THIS WOMAN?

25:11.581 --> 25:13.082
ACTUALLY, A FRIEND OF MINE
USED HER TO CATER A PARTY ONCE.

25:13.082 --> 25:14.744
SAID SHE HAD SHIFTY EYES.

25:14.744 --> 25:16.085
THEY DO LOOK PRETTY SHIFTY.

25:16.085 --> 25:18.988
W-WELL, I DO KNOW HER,
AND SHE'S INNOCENT.

25:18.988 --> 25:20.189
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
THE POLICE GO AROUND

25:20.189 --> 25:21.851
ARRESTING INNOCENT PEOPLE.

25:21.851 --> 25:23.593
SHE MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING.

25:23.593 --> 25:25.555
OH, SO YOU GUYS READ
ONE ARTICLE,

25:25.555 --> 25:27.256
AND JUST LIKE THAT,
SHE'S GUILTY?

25:27.256 --> 25:30.029
IT'S NOT JUST US. EVERYONE SAYS
SHE KILLED THE GUY.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.932
SHE'S THE LAST PERSON IN THIS
WORLD WHO WOULD KILL SOMEBODY.

25:32.932 --> 25:35.104
SHE'S A FRIEND
AND A MOTHER

25:35.104 --> 25:38.007
AND PROBABLY THE MOST
DECENT PERSON I KNOW.

25:38.007 --> 25:39.138
AND SHE WOULD DIE
 IF SHE KNEW

25:39.138 --> 25:41.671
HOW PEOPLE
ARE TALKING ABOUT HER.

25:41.671 --> 25:43.172
WELL, SHE BETTER GET USED
TO IT.

25:43.172 --> 25:48.117
IF I'M A JUROR, SHE'S GOING AWAY
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

25:51.120 --> 25:52.551
(both inhale deeply)

25:52.551 --> 25:54.824
AND WITH EVERY EXHALE,

25:54.824 --> 25:57.787
THE TENSION
IS BEING BLOWN OUT,

25:57.787 --> 26:01.931
AND EVERY INHALE
BRINGS IN POSITIVE ENERGY.

26:01.931 --> 26:04.934
(exhales deeply)
 NOW YOU'RE IMAGINING

26:04.934 --> 26:07.937
A PEACEFUL SCENE--

26:07.937 --> 26:11.300
THAT BEAUTIFUL LAWN
BY THE SCIENCE BUILDING

26:11.300 --> 26:12.642
AT YOUR COLLEGE.

26:12.642 --> 26:16.345
AND YOU'RE WALKING
TOWARDS THE CHEMISTRY LAB

26:16.345 --> 26:19.749
TO FINISH THE RESEARCH
FOR YOUR DISSERTATION.

26:19.749 --> 26:24.814
AND NOW ON THAT SAME LAWN,
A GRADUATION CEREMONY

26:24.814 --> 26:30.219
IN WHICH YOU ARE FINALLY
RECEIVING YOUR PhD.

26:30.219 --> 26:32.692
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:34.193 --> 26:36.225
THE OTHER DAY, YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT A MURDER TRIAL,

26:36.225 --> 26:38.798
AND NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
STUFF THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.631
I THINK IT WILL.

26:41.631 --> 26:43.302
HOW?

26:43.302 --> 26:45.975
BECAUSE I AM GOING
TO MOVE BACK UP THERE WITH YOU

26:45.975 --> 26:48.337
AND HELP RAISE THE BABY.

26:48.337 --> 26:49.308
WHAT?

26:49.308 --> 26:53.983
I'M GONNA SELL THIS HOUSE,
AND M.J. AND I

26:53.983 --> 26:56.185
ARE GOING WITH YOU
SO YOU CAN FINISH YOUR DEGREE.

26:56.185 --> 26:59.318
BUT... WHAT ABOUT PORTER?

26:59.318 --> 27:01.721
WELL, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE
A PLACE FOR HIM

27:01.721 --> 27:04.223
IN HIS CHILD'S LIFE,

27:04.223 --> 27:09.098
BUT PORTER NEEDS TO FIND
HIS OWN LIFE RIGHT NOW.

27:09.098 --> 27:13.362
NO. I CAN'T LET YOU DO THIS.
YOU LOVE THE LANE.

27:13.362 --> 27:18.637
OH, I DO, BUT NOWHERE NEAR
AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.270
AND BESIDES...

27:21.270 --> 27:23.873
(sighs) I THINK
IT'LL BE GOOD FOR ME, TOO.

27:23.873 --> 27:25.314
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

27:25.314 --> 27:27.817
WELL, I TOLD YOU, HONEY.
THERE ARE MEMORIES HERE

27:27.817 --> 27:31.881
THAT ARE JUST TOO HARD
TO LIVE WITH EVERY DAY.

27:35.925 --> 27:38.928
MOM...

27:38.928 --> 27:41.831
THIS WOULD BE AWESOME.

27:41.831 --> 27:45.134
BUT... ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANNA DO THIS?

27:45.134 --> 27:48.397
I'M SURE.

27:48.397 --> 27:50.800
(chuckles)

27:50.800 --> 27:51.871
OH.

27:51.871 --> 27:55.905
OKAY. LAY BACK DOWN.

27:55.905 --> 27:58.177
AS MIKE USED TO SAY,

27:58.177 --> 27:59.849
WE GOTTA PRACTICE
BIRTHING A BABY.

27:59.849 --> 28:01.811
(chuckles)

28:04.413 --> 28:06.455
(both exhale deeply)

28:06.455 --> 28:08.888
YOU ARE GONNA LOVE IT THERE,
McGUINNESS.

28:08.888 --> 28:12.161
AND HEY, IF YOU DON'T,
IT'S ONLY A YEAR.

28:12.161 --> 28:16.395
I'LL GIVE YOU MY
"INDIA ON 50 RUPEES A DAY" BOOK.

28:16.395 --> 28:19.128
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
LET'S GET STARTED.

28:19.128 --> 28:23.402
THANKS AGAIN. I AM SO GLAD
TO BE STAYING HERE.

28:23.402 --> 28:27.406
YEAH, WELL, THANK YOUR EX-WIFE.
SHE'S THE ONE WHO CONVINCED ME.

28:27.406 --> 28:30.479
REALLY? LYNETTE DID THAT?

28:30.479 --> 28:32.311
YEAH. (chuckles)
REAL PIECE OF WORK, THAT ONE.

28:32.311 --> 28:35.244
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU PUT UP
WITH IT.

28:35.244 --> 28:40.089
(chuckles) I'M SORRY. UM...
AREN'T YOU GUYS DATING?

28:40.089 --> 28:42.091
NO. SHE DUMPED ME.

28:42.091 --> 28:43.793
APPARENTLY, SHE'S HUNG UP
ON SOME OTHER GUY.

28:46.095 --> 28:47.396
I'M SURPRISED
YOU DIDN'T WANNA GO TO MUMBAI

28:47.396 --> 28:49.258
JUST TO GET AWAY
FROM HER CRAP.

28:49.258 --> 28:51.260
(both chuckle)

28:51.260 --> 28:55.905
I KNOW. SHE CAN BE, UH,
A BIT OF A HANDFUL.

28:55.905 --> 28:56.966
OH, YEAH, THAT'S WHY
YOU DUMPED HER,

28:56.966 --> 28:57.967
'CAUSE SHE'S A "HANDFUL."

28:57.967 --> 28:58.968
(both chuckle)

28:58.968 --> 29:00.840
I'M TELLING YOU, GUYS,

29:00.840 --> 29:02.741
23 YEARS LIVING
WITH THAT PSYCHO--

29:02.741 --> 29:05.915
HE'S EITHER A SAINT
OR A MASOCHIST.

29:05.915 --> 29:07.316
(laughter)

29:07.316 --> 29:10.820
OKAY. OKAY. (chuckles)
LET'S--LET'S START THE MEETING.

29:10.820 --> 29:12.952
OH, SERIOUSLY. I BARELY
SURVIVED ONE WEEK

29:12.952 --> 29:14.784
WITH THAT BALL-BUSTER.

29:14.784 --> 29:16.755
GREGG, I'M ASKING YOU,
DROP IT.

29:16.755 --> 29:20.459
I'M JUST SAYING LYNETTE
IS A FIRST CLASS BITCH.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.331
UHH!
 (both) OH.

29:23.993 --> 29:27.096
WELL, I HOPE THAT WAS
WORTH IT,

29:27.096 --> 29:28.898
'CAUSE YOU'RE FIRED.

29:41.050 --> 29:42.982
OKAY, MR. WESTON,

29:42.982 --> 29:45.855
IS THE DEFENSE READY TO CALL
ITS FIRST WITNESS?

29:45.855 --> 29:49.118
WE ARE, YOUR HONOR.
THE DEFENSE CALLS SUSAN DELFINO.

29:51.560 --> 29:53.893
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN
MY CLIENT?

29:53.893 --> 29:55.194
NEARLY 20 YEARS.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.196
SO IT'S FAIR TO SAY
YOU KNOW EACH OTHER WELL?

29:57.196 --> 29:58.497
WE'RE LIKE SISTERS.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.529
SHE'S THE MOST HONEST PERSON
I'VE EVER MET.

30:00.529 --> 30:03.172
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED
ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION?

30:03.172 --> 30:05.304
IT WAS
A PROGRESSIVE DINNER PARTY.

30:05.304 --> 30:08.077
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T GET OUT MUCH.

30:08.077 --> 30:10.179
WHAT IS
A PROGRESSIVE DINNER PARTY?

30:10.179 --> 30:11.410
THE WHOLE STREET THROWS IT.

30:11.410 --> 30:14.183
EVERY HOUSE IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR A SPECIFIC COURSE.

30:14.183 --> 30:16.345
OH, SOUNDS LIKE FUN.
 UNLESS YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO COOK.

30:16.345 --> 30:18.317
THEY SKIPPED MY HOUSE
THAT NIGHT.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.349
NOW AS YOU TRAVELED
FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE,

30:20.349 --> 30:23.152
WERE YOU WITH BREE
THE WHOLE TIME?

30:23.152 --> 30:24.193
NO.

30:24.193 --> 30:25.824
REALLY?

30:25.824 --> 30:27.196
WHERE DID SHE GO?

30:27.196 --> 30:30.059
SHE LEFT MY HOUSE
TO GO CHECK ON HER ENTREE.

30:30.059 --> 30:33.332
WOULDN'T THAT HAVE GIVEN HER
TIME TO KILL MR. SANCHEZ?

30:33.332 --> 30:35.504
OR HAVE SEX WITH HER BOYFRIEND
WHILE THE CHICKEN BURNED,

30:35.504 --> 30:38.007
WHICH IS WHAT SHE WAS DOING
WHEN THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD

30:38.007 --> 30:39.168
WALKED IN ON HER.

30:39.168 --> 30:41.070
I IMAGINE THAT MUST HAVE
BEEN AWKWARD.

30:41.070 --> 30:43.873
CLEARLY, YOU HAVEN'T SPENT
MUCH TIME ON MY STREET.

30:43.873 --> 30:45.875
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

30:45.875 --> 30:48.147
THE PARTY FINISHED
AT MY HOUSE,

30:48.147 --> 30:50.079
AND THEN SUSAN, LYNETTE,
AND BREE STAYED LATE

30:50.079 --> 30:51.380
TO HELP ME CLEAN UP.

30:51.380 --> 30:53.552
HOW LATE?
 AROUND 2:00 IN THE MORNING.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.985
AND THE CORONER'S REPORT
SAID THAT THE TIME OF DEATH

30:55.985 --> 30:59.588
WAS BETWEEN 10:00 P.M.
AND MIDNIGHT. INTERESTING.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.032
SO THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY

31:03.032 --> 31:06.095
THAT BREE COULD HAVE KILLED
RAMON SANCHEZ THAT NIGHT?

31:06.095 --> 31:09.168
NO WAY.
BREE COULDN'T HURT A FLY.

31:09.168 --> 31:13.172
THE ONLY THING SHE KILLED
THAT NIGHT WAS THE CHICKEN.

31:13.172 --> 31:17.106
NO. AS GOD AS MY WITNESS,
BREE DID NOT KILL HIM.

31:23.212 --> 31:24.653
THAT'S IT FROM THE CAR.

31:24.653 --> 31:26.655
MY ASSISTANT'S GONNA PACK UP
THE REST OF IT.

31:26.655 --> 31:30.259
SECURITY'S BEEN TOLD NOT
TO LET ME BACK IN THE BUILDING.

31:30.259 --> 31:32.191
I SWEAR, TOM,
I AM TRYING TO BE SUPPORTIVE,

31:32.191 --> 31:34.393
BUT I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
FOLLOWING THIS.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.966
WHY WOULD YOU HIT YOUR BOSS?

31:36.966 --> 31:40.069
I JUST... NEVER LIKED HIM.

31:40.069 --> 31:42.671
SO? THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE
YOU DON'T LIKE.

31:42.671 --> 31:45.674
MR. INDICH IN 3F, WHO NEVER
PICKS UP AFTER HIS DOG--

31:45.674 --> 31:48.907
I CAN'T EVEN GET YOU TO WRITE
AN ANGRY NOTE.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.440
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LOST MY TEMPER.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.412
BECAUSE HE WAS
GOING TO TRANSFER YOU?

31:53.412 --> 31:57.086
NO. (sighs)

31:57.086 --> 31:58.117
(frame clatters)

31:58.117 --> 32:00.649
BECAUSE HE WAS
DATING LYNETTE.

32:05.554 --> 32:07.656
OH, MY GOD.

32:07.656 --> 32:09.928
ARE YOU STILL IN LOVE
WITH HER?

32:12.461 --> 32:15.404
JANE, LOOK, YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND. LYNETTE HAS--

32:15.404 --> 32:18.337
BEEN A PART OF YOUR LIFE
FOR 23 YEARS. I KNOW.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.169
SHE'S THE MOTHER
OF YOUR CHILDREN.

32:20.169 --> 32:22.641
I GET IT. YOU'VE GIVEN ME
THIS SPEECH A HUNDRED TIMES.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.413
NOW ANSWER THE QUESTION.

32:24.413 --> 32:26.245
DO YOU STILL LOVE HER?

32:28.147 --> 32:29.248
YES.

32:31.280 --> 32:32.621
(whispers) WOW.

32:32.621 --> 32:35.254
AND I WAS, WHAT?

32:35.254 --> 32:38.957
SOME... WALL YOU BUILT TO TRY
AND HIDE THAT FROM YOURSELF?

32:38.957 --> 32:41.430
NO.

32:41.430 --> 32:43.332
YOU WERE THE WOMAN
WHO WAS THERE FOR ME

32:43.332 --> 32:46.965
WHEN I WAS BROKEN
AND CONFUSED,

32:46.965 --> 32:49.338
AND I-I STILL CARE ABOUT YOU
VERY MUCH.

32:49.338 --> 32:51.270
NO.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.002
TOM, YOU DON'T GET TO BREAK
SOMEBODY'S HEART

32:53.002 --> 32:54.973
AND STILL SAY YOU CARE
ABOUT THEM.

33:01.210 --> 33:03.352
IF IT MATTERS...

33:03.352 --> 33:04.453
I LOVED YOU.

33:12.361 --> 33:15.264
(door opens and closes)

33:15.264 --> 33:18.297
SO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN
AS WELL?

33:18.297 --> 33:22.101
YES. I SLEPT WITH HIM, TOO.

33:22.101 --> 33:25.304
I CAN IMAGINE HOW PAINFUL
THIS IS,

33:25.304 --> 33:29.078
HAVING TO PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGE
LIAISONS WITH ALL THESE MEN.

33:29.078 --> 33:30.779
NO. YOU CAN'T.

33:30.779 --> 33:32.611
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO TESTIFY.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.683
WHY DID YOU SUBJECT YOURSELF
TO THIS?

33:34.683 --> 33:37.686
BECAUSE I ADMIT
MY TRANSGRESSIONS.

33:37.686 --> 33:40.419
WAS KILLING RAMON SANCHEZ
ONE OF THEM?

33:40.419 --> 33:43.222
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

33:51.630 --> 33:54.563
THAT SEEMED VERY HEARTFELT.

33:54.563 --> 33:56.335
SO YOUR CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR?

33:56.335 --> 33:59.268
YES. IT IS.

33:59.268 --> 34:02.411
YOUR HONOR, I'D LIKE
TO ENTER INTO EVIDENCE

34:02.411 --> 34:04.443
PROSECUTION EXHIBIT 24.

34:04.443 --> 34:08.045
OBJECTION. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THIS.
THEY CAN'T BLINDSIDE US--

34:08.045 --> 34:10.248
THIS JUST CAME INTO
OUR POSSESSION LAST NIGHT.

34:10.248 --> 34:11.420
IT REBUTS
MS. VAN DE KAMP'S TESTIMONY

34:11.420 --> 34:13.452
REGARDING
HER CLEAR CONSCIENCE.

34:14.523 --> 34:16.824
I'LL ALLOW IT.

34:16.824 --> 34:18.587
DOES THIS LETTER
LOOK FAMILIAR?

34:25.434 --> 34:27.436
YES. I WROTE IT.

34:27.436 --> 34:31.340
IT'S A SUICIDE NOTE,
ISN'T IT?

34:31.340 --> 34:32.541
YES.

34:32.541 --> 34:36.074
THIS LETTER WAS DISCOVERED
ON MAY 7th AT THE FROST HOTEL,

34:36.074 --> 34:38.206
WHERE MS. VAN DE KAMP
HAD TAKEN A ROOM.

34:38.206 --> 34:39.277
THE MANAGER HEARD SHOUTING,

34:39.277 --> 34:41.250
INCLUDING A REFERENCE
TO "A GUN."

34:41.250 --> 34:43.312
POLICE WERE SUMMONED,
BUT MS. VAN DE KAMP WAS GONE.

34:43.312 --> 34:44.683
THIS WAS FOUND
IN THE WASTEBASKET.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.655
PROCEED, MS. STONE.

34:46.655 --> 34:50.389
DO YOU RECALL ANYTHING ELSE
OF SIGNIFICANCE

34:50.389 --> 34:52.261
OCCURRING ON MAY 7th?

34:52.261 --> 34:53.661
NO.

34:53.661 --> 34:56.565
THAT'S THE DAY YOUR BOYFRIEND,
CHUCK VANCE,

34:56.565 --> 34:59.428
A DECORATED
FAIRVIEW POLICE DETECTIVE,

34:59.428 --> 35:01.330
WAS KILLED IN A HIT AND RUN
ACCIDENT, WASN'T IT?

35:01.330 --> 35:03.432
OBJECTION.
MY CLIENT ISN'T ON TRIAL

35:03.432 --> 35:05.574
FOR KILLING DETECTIVE VANCE.
 NOT YET.

35:05.574 --> 35:07.736
YOUR HONOR--
 WITHDRAWN.

35:07.736 --> 35:10.509
PLEASE. READ THE LETTER.

35:22.621 --> 35:28.557
"I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD FEEL
SUCH... REMORSE, SUCH GUILT."

35:28.557 --> 35:31.200
YOUR HONOR, IF WE COULD TAKE
A SHORT RECESS...

35:31.200 --> 35:32.601
DENIED.

35:32.601 --> 35:34.703
(voice breaking)
"NO ONE KNOWS WHO I REALLY AM.

35:34.703 --> 35:37.506
"I'M ENTIRELY ALONE.

35:37.506 --> 35:40.539
"LIVING WITH THIS SECRET
IS TOO PAINFUL.

35:40.539 --> 35:43.472
I CAN'T GO ON."

35:45.474 --> 35:46.915
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
A CLEAR CONSCIENCE, DOES IT,

35:46.915 --> 35:48.547
MS VAN DE KAMP?

35:48.547 --> 35:51.480
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

35:54.253 --> 35:56.425
BREE.
 PLEASE, I JUST NEED
TO BE ALONE.

35:56.425 --> 35:59.788
NOT UNTIL YOU TELL ME
WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT.

35:59.788 --> 36:01.790
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

36:01.790 --> 36:03.932
I WAS IN A VERY DARK PLACE,
WITH THE DRINKING

36:03.932 --> 36:06.495
AND MY FRIENDS
ABANDONING ME.

36:06.495 --> 36:09.468
BUT I DID NOT KILL ANYONE.

36:09.468 --> 36:10.599
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

36:10.599 --> 36:12.541
I DO BELIEVE YOU.

36:12.541 --> 36:16.475
I JUST...
HOPE THE JURY DOES.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.350
COME ON. YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT IT'S YOUR FAULT.

36:21.350 --> 36:26.715
PLEASE, TOM LOSES HIS JOB
THE DAY AFTER I DUMP HIS BOSS?

36:26.715 --> 36:28.557
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME CONNECTION,

36:28.557 --> 36:29.958
AND THE WORST PART IS
THIS IS EXACTLY

36:29.958 --> 36:31.590
WHAT BROKE US UP
IN THE FIRST PLACE--

36:31.590 --> 36:33.662
ME TRYING TO CONTROL
HIS LIFE.

36:33.662 --> 36:36.895
(laughs)

36:36.895 --> 36:40.299
YOU REALLY SUCK
AT THIS GAY FRIEND THING.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.530
(laughs) I'M SORRY.

36:41.530 --> 36:43.772
I CAN'T TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY
IN THAT DRESS.

36:43.772 --> 36:46.375
YOU LOOK LIKE
A GIANT TAFFETA BRUISE.

36:46.375 --> 36:49.508
I KNOW. IT IS HORRIBLE.
MAYBE IF I ACCESSORIZE.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.880
UNLESS THE ACCESSORIES ARE
TWO HANDS OVER YOUR EYES,

36:51.880 --> 36:55.384
FORGET IT. WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TELL RENEE YOU HATE THE DRESS?

36:55.384 --> 36:58.587
BECAUSE SHE'LL PICK ANOTHER ONE,
AND I'LL HATE THAT ONE, TOO.

36:58.587 --> 37:00.419
IT'S WHAT I DO.

37:00.419 --> 37:03.452
I DID IT TO TOM
ALL THE TIME.

37:03.452 --> 37:04.593
(shoe clatters)

37:04.593 --> 37:06.955
I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO GO TO SCHOOL,

37:06.955 --> 37:08.997
AND THEN I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO QUIT.

37:08.997 --> 37:10.629
I WANTED HIM TO GET
A NEW JOB,

37:10.629 --> 37:12.701
AND THEN I HATED IT.
I DON'T KNOW.

37:12.701 --> 37:14.533
MAYBE I WASN'T UNHAPPY
WITH TOM.

37:14.533 --> 37:17.536
MAYBE I WAS JUST...

37:17.536 --> 37:18.837
UNHAPPY.

37:18.837 --> 37:21.540
WELL...

37:21.540 --> 37:23.842
AT LEAST WE KNOW YOU WERE
RIGHT ABOUT THAT DRESS.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.474
(scoffs)

37:25.474 --> 37:27.616
NOW TURN AROUND,
LET ME GET YOU OUT OF IT.

37:27.616 --> 37:29.418
(glass clatters)

37:31.380 --> 37:32.651
SERIOUSLY?
WE'RE THIS CLOSE?

37:32.651 --> 37:34.383
WHEN I TELL
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD ABOUT IT,

37:34.383 --> 37:35.554
I WILL BE KIND.

37:35.554 --> 37:39.728
(chuckles)
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND, LEE.

38:02.010 --> 38:03.452
(Juanita)
CELIA, GIVE ME THE REMOTE!

38:03.452 --> 38:05.684
(Celia) NO! STOP!
 GIVE IT!

38:05.684 --> 38:07.556
GIRLS, DON'T MAKE ME
COME IN THERE!

38:07.556 --> 38:09.458
IT'S MY TURN!
 IT'S NOT!

38:09.458 --> 38:10.459
AAH!

38:10.459 --> 38:11.820
(object shatters)

38:11.820 --> 38:13.291
(knife clatters)

38:13.291 --> 38:16.064
WHO DID THIS?

38:16.064 --> 38:17.065
CELIA.

38:17.065 --> 38:18.066
IS THAT TRUE, CELIA?

38:18.066 --> 38:20.969
THIS BELONGED
TO MY GRANDMOTHER.

38:20.969 --> 38:23.071
YOU ARE IN BIG TROUBLE,
YOUNG LADY.

38:23.071 --> 38:25.434
SWEEP UP THE REST,
AND GO TO YOUR ROOM.

38:25.434 --> 38:28.907
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
SHE PUSHED ME INTO IT.

38:28.907 --> 38:32.411
YOU PUSHED HER?
 SHE WOULDN'T GIVE ME
THE REMOTE,

38:32.411 --> 38:34.583
AND IT WAS MY TURN
TO PICK WHAT WE WATCH.

38:34.583 --> 38:36.314
SO YOU BROKE THIS.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.917
IT WAS MY TURN.

38:38.917 --> 38:41.620
JUANITA SOLIS, YOU WERE GONNA
LET YOUR SISTER TAKE THE BLAME

38:41.620 --> 38:42.651
FOR SOMETHING YOU CAUSED?

38:42.651 --> 38:44.453
THAT IS HORRIBLE!

38:44.453 --> 38:46.625
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.
OWN UP TO IT.

38:46.625 --> 38:49.027
DON'T YOU SEE HOW BAD--

38:53.001 --> 38:56.635
MOM? I'M SORRY.

38:59.538 --> 39:00.569
MOMMY?

39:00.569 --> 39:02.541
IT'S OKAY.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.813
GO WASH UP FOR DINNER.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

39:10.879 --> 39:13.522
(sighs)

39:13.522 --> 39:15.824
AND THE FRACTURE FOUND
ON THE VICTIM'S HEAD

39:15.824 --> 39:18.627
IS CONSISTENT
WITH A BLUNT FORCE INJURY.

39:18.627 --> 39:20.529
(Ms. Stone)
A BLUNT FORCE THAT SOMEONE

39:20.529 --> 39:21.890
OF MS. VAN DE KAMP'S SIZE
WOULD BE CAPABLE OF INFLICTING?

39:21.890 --> 39:24.032
IN MY OPINION.

39:24.032 --> 39:27.866
YOUR HONOR, THE DEFENSE ASKS
THE COURT FOR A RECESS.

39:34.973 --> 39:37.506
HOW DID YOU FIND THAT?

39:37.506 --> 39:41.550
WHEN GABY MENTIONED
HER "GARDENER," ALEJANDRO,

39:41.550 --> 39:42.651
MY ALARM BELLS WENT OFF.

39:42.651 --> 39:44.783
I HAD LINDSAY DO
A LITTLE INVESTIGATING.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.084
OH.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.486
"OH"?

39:47.486 --> 39:49.818
WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH
YOUR MURDER TRIAL,

39:49.818 --> 39:52.491
AND I FIND OUT THE VICTIM
IS GABY'S STEPFATHER,

39:52.491 --> 39:54.563
AND ALL YOU CAN SAY IS "OH"?

39:54.563 --> 39:55.924
I'M SORRY.

39:55.924 --> 39:58.567
I WANTED TO TELL YOU,
BUT WE MADE A PACT.

39:58.567 --> 39:59.668
WHO DID?

39:59.668 --> 40:00.729
YOU AND GABY?

40:00.729 --> 40:04.633
ME AND GABY AND...
OTHER PEOPLE--

40:04.633 --> 40:06.104
PEOPLE THAT I CARE ABOUT.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.136
(scoffs) YOU CARE ABOUT THEM
ENOUGH TO LIE FOR THEM?

40:08.136 --> 40:09.538
TO COMMIT PERJURY?

40:09.538 --> 40:13.542
HOW ABOUT ENOUGH
TO GO TO JAIL?

40:13.542 --> 40:16.515
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY THINK
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, DO YOU?
 I DON'T KNOW.

40:16.515 --> 40:18.747
AFTER THE D.A.'s
SUICIDE NOTE STUNT,

40:18.747 --> 40:20.118
IT'S POSSIBLE.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.990
TO THE JURY, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING,

40:21.990 --> 40:24.693
AND THE FACT IS,
YOU ARE.

40:26.655 --> 40:31.760
LOOK, I JUST--I JUST--
I WANNA WIN THIS CASE

40:31.760 --> 40:33.562
FOR YOU, OKAY?

40:33.562 --> 40:36.835
AND IF THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT CAN EXONERATE YOU,

40:36.835 --> 40:40.709
IT CAN, BUT NOT WITHOUT
BETRAYING MY FRIENDS.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.849
BREE...

40:50.849 --> 40:53.051
YOU'RE FACING 20 YEARS
TO LIFE.

40:53.051 --> 40:55.824
THIS COULD BE
YOUR ONLY WAY OUT.

40:55.824 --> 40:59.127
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT GABY.

41:05.193 --> 41:08.697
(Mary Alice) YES, RECENT EVENTS
IN THE LIVES OF MY FRIENDS

41:08.697 --> 41:12.671
HAD STIRRED UP
INTENSE EMOTIONS...

41:13.902 --> 41:18.677
EXCITEMENT
ABOUT STARTING A NEW CHAPTER...

41:20.048 --> 41:23.912
GUILT
OVER CAUSING ANOTHER'S PAIN...

41:26.755 --> 41:31.059
DISAPPOINTMENT
IN A FAILURE TO CHANGE.

41:31.059 --> 41:34.723
THEN THERE ARE THOSE
WHO ARE ASKED

41:34.723 --> 41:37.195
TO PUT ALL EMOTION ASIDE

41:37.195 --> 41:41.770
IN ORDER TO MAKE
A COLDHEARTED DECISION.

41:41.770 --> 41:44.973
GABY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

41:46.735 --> 41:49.037
I FINALLY FOUND
THE PERFECT SCARF.

41:49.037 --> 41:50.709
IT'S... ELEGANT.

41:50.709 --> 41:53.181
IT'S DIGNIFIED.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

41:53.181 --> 41:55.013
IT'S YOU.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.985
YOU ARE SO SWEET.

41:56.985 --> 41:58.516
YOU DIDN'T NEED
TO DO THIS.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.750
YES, I DID.

42:01.750 --> 42:05.153
I HAVEN'T TRULY THANKED YOU
FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

42:05.153 --> 42:08.156
THE WAY YOU'RE SACRIFICING
YOURSELF FOR ME AND MY FAMILY.

42:09.658 --> 42:13.531
YOU'RE JUST A MUCH BETTER PERSON
THAN I COULD EVER HOPE TO BE.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.134
(whispers) OH, GABY.
