WEBVTT

00:05.094 --> 00:07.000
Uh, Sid, can you pass the salt?

00:07.338 --> 00:09.732
Sure, Charlie. I assume you're
asking that because I have

00:09.757 --> 00:12.460
all the time in the world,
since my boyfriend dumped me.

00:12.976 --> 00:14.296
Well, while we're passing things,

00:14.467 --> 00:16.226
I might want to pass on some advice:

00:16.329 --> 00:18.406
wash your hat once!

00:20.789 --> 00:24.539
All right, I know things have been
tough since you broke up with John,

00:24.564 --> 00:27.663
but if you don't stop talking like
that, I'm gonna kick your little ass.

00:28.509 --> 00:30.765
Why does everyone hate me?

00:31.108 --> 00:33.093
I'm so unlovable.

00:34.776 --> 00:36.999
Yikes. I don't need salt, okay?

00:38.178 --> 00:39.522
Unbelievable.

00:40.055 --> 00:42.694
I just got a invitation
to my son Tony's wedding.

00:42.882 --> 00:44.045
Check this out.

00:44.569 --> 00:46.765
"Hosted by Lorraine and Reggie."

00:46.790 --> 00:49.179
My ex-wife and her husband
are running the show.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.391
No mention of me at all.

00:50.562 --> 00:51.762
- I have been replaced.
- Whoa.

00:51.855 --> 00:54.323
I don't think Tony is
trying to replace you.

00:54.386 --> 00:56.269
I mean, you guys
are really close, right?

00:56.298 --> 00:58.050
Well, yeah. I mean, that's my son.

00:58.251 --> 00:59.488
Fruit of my loins.

00:59.781 --> 01:02.273
We don't chitty-chat all that much,
'cause we're grown-ass men.

01:02.298 --> 01:03.389
But I told him, I said,

01:03.414 --> 01:07.390
"You let me know when and where
this wedding is and I will be there."

01:07.766 --> 01:10.499
Well, it sounds like he's doing
exactly what you told him to.

01:13.626 --> 01:15.038
It sounds like you're not listening.

01:15.062 --> 01:18.422
I'm being sidelined at
my own son's wedding.

01:19.062 --> 01:21.328
Well, it's time for old
Hank to assert himself.

01:21.353 --> 01:23.664
And I'm gonna start by
inviting y'all three.

01:23.762 --> 01:25.851
Oh, no. Count me out, Hank.

01:25.897 --> 01:28.609
I really don't need
any tense family drama.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.445
It's at some fancy Vegas hotel.

01:32.172 --> 01:34.179
Well, what is life
without a little drama?

01:34.204 --> 01:35.492
I'm in. I love Vegas.

01:35.570 --> 01:38.593
Yeah. Me, too. I got that town wired.

01:39.098 --> 01:41.672
I got connections at
the Sands, the Sahara.

01:41.892 --> 01:44.263
It sounds like you had that town wired.

01:44.444 --> 01:46.044
Those places have been torn down.

01:46.109 --> 01:48.630
No. Trust me, when they
hear that I'm coming back,

01:48.819 --> 01:50.212
I'm gonna rule that place.

01:50.374 --> 01:51.755
You know, back in the '70s,

01:51.862 --> 01:53.919
they used to call me
Charlie Sell Phones.

01:54.043 --> 01:56.222
Stop lying, stank hat.

01:56.433 --> 01:59.409
They didn't even have
cell phones in the '70S.

01:59.471 --> 02:00.471
Uh-uh.

02:00.496 --> 02:02.002
"Sell" with an "S."

02:02.288 --> 02:05.252
I used to sell rotary
phones to key figures

02:05.277 --> 02:06.666
in the Vegas underworld.

02:06.844 --> 02:07.947
They were untappable.

02:09.315 --> 02:11.088
Well, y'all have fun.

02:11.619 --> 02:13.916
Vegas is no place for the brokenhearted.

02:14.323 --> 02:16.862
I should go someplace like Pittsburgh.

02:17.549 --> 02:20.346
Oh, come on. This is gonna be great.

02:20.447 --> 02:22.994
Vegas is the perfect place
for you to get over John.

02:23.083 --> 02:25.041
After my divorce, I went to Vegas.

02:25.066 --> 02:27.119
I got over ten years
of pain in one weekend.

02:27.196 --> 02:30.539
And so Vegas Margaret was born.

02:31.025 --> 02:34.057
One day, I tipped the
pool boy with my room key.

02:34.082 --> 02:36.447
Oh, all right. All right,
all right, all right, I'll go.

02:36.472 --> 02:39.745
Anything to keep me from
hearing the end of your sex story.

02:39.770 --> 02:41.432
Oh, you're gonna hear it all right.

02:41.457 --> 02:44.292
So, the air is thick with
the smell of chlorine,

02:44.572 --> 02:46.681
- and I am really horny...
- Aah!

03:14.518 --> 03:15.964
What the hell happened to Vegas?

03:15.989 --> 03:17.730
It used to be the devil's playground.

03:17.755 --> 03:20.706
Now it looks like a unicorn
threw up all over the place.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.030
And most of it landed on your outfit.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.589
Hey, you ain't seen nothin' yet.

03:25.655 --> 03:27.893
This is Vegas Margaret understated.

03:27.918 --> 03:31.018
I got an outfit in my
bag that needs batteries.

03:32.026 --> 03:34.378
Okay, Sid, come on. Let's
go get you over John.

03:34.725 --> 03:36.301
I'll tell you what would
help me get over John is

03:36.325 --> 03:38.184
you not saying his
name every five minutes.

03:39.429 --> 03:41.429
- All right, I'm gonna go check us in.
- All right.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.014
- Hey, Pop!
- Tony!

03:45.435 --> 03:48.106
Look at you. My son, getting married.

03:49.770 --> 03:51.590
- There's the man of the hour.
- Hey, Reggie.

03:51.781 --> 03:53.555
Thanks so much for those
MMA tickets last night.

03:53.579 --> 03:55.186
We were so close, we got blood on us.

03:57.025 --> 03:59.241
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Re-Re-Reggie, Reggie, Reggie.

03:59.359 --> 04:01.515
Excuse me, me and, uh,
Tony weren't finished

04:01.540 --> 04:02.700
with our little greeting yet.

04:02.986 --> 04:05.421
Ha-ah! Here I go.

04:10.530 --> 04:12.671
We do... we do this all the time.

04:13.082 --> 04:14.126
I love you so much, son.

04:16.065 --> 04:18.241
I knew you were gonna make
a fool of yourself at this wedding,

04:18.265 --> 04:20.685
I just didn't know it was gonna
be in the first minute, Hank.

04:22.869 --> 04:25.358
So you do know my name.
'Cause I couldn't find it

04:25.490 --> 04:27.429
- on that invitation.
- That's enough, you two.

04:28.007 --> 04:29.297
I don't need you guys
fighting all weekend.

04:29.321 --> 04:30.641
Let's just focus on the positive.

04:30.983 --> 04:34.116
We're all here together... you, me, Dad,

04:34.533 --> 04:36.467
Reggie, that guy.

04:37.498 --> 04:39.818
those two other white people
you brought who I barely know.

04:41.057 --> 04:43.030
All right, my room is comped.

04:43.555 --> 04:45.062
They must have heard I was back in town.

04:45.086 --> 04:47.365
This has got Ronnie Room
Comps written all over it.

04:47.739 --> 04:50.046
Actually, it was Reggie. He
picked up everybody's rooms.

04:50.384 --> 04:51.411
He's the best, isn't he?

04:51.703 --> 04:53.670
Uh, Reggie, me and my
friends... we not impressed

04:53.695 --> 04:55.178
with your little room comp.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.326
Reggie, you honor me with this comp.

05:00.403 --> 05:02.592
If you ever need a
rotary phone installed,

05:02.857 --> 05:04.108
I'm your guy.

05:06.247 --> 05:07.412
Good to know. Thank you.

05:08.966 --> 05:11.834
Oh, yes. Reggie's paying for everything.

05:12.103 --> 05:15.123
And I mean everything.

05:16.539 --> 05:19.342
Bachelor party. Bachelorette
party. Rooms. Wi-Fi.

05:19.370 --> 05:21.893
And that's premium Wi-Fi, no buffering.

05:22.486 --> 05:24.768
Well, it's not every day
your son gets married.

05:24.793 --> 05:27.284
Uh, stepson. Don't
forget the, uh, "step."

05:28.160 --> 05:29.316
- You see what he's doing?
- Yeah.

05:29.340 --> 05:31.753
He trying to make me look
bad in front of my own son.

05:31.890 --> 05:34.363
All right, guys, we're out.
I hope we see both of you

05:34.388 --> 05:36.308
at the bachelor party
dinner tonight. It's on me.

05:36.401 --> 05:39.651
The hell it is. I'm buying
dinner for the family.

05:39.721 --> 05:41.455
- Wow, thanks, Dad.
- Hank's paying?

05:41.518 --> 05:43.260
Where y'all eating,
at a vending machine?

05:48.855 --> 05:50.682
So, check it out, Sid.

05:50.959 --> 05:53.900
This is my Vegas Margaret outfit.

05:54.732 --> 05:56.690
Well, honey, it's like the sun...

05:56.715 --> 05:58.228
it's bright, shiny

05:58.863 --> 06:00.041
and hard to look at.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.674
Enough. Time to change that attitude

06:03.699 --> 06:05.174
- and get you over...
- No, no!

06:05.199 --> 06:06.307
Don't you say it.

06:07.125 --> 06:09.345
You know who. All right.

06:09.553 --> 06:12.693
We're gonna go big, Sid.
We've each got $500 in chips.

06:12.718 --> 06:14.894
So if you follow my
lead, we can triple this.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.742
Waitress. Could we get a couple
of Moscow Mules for us high rollers?

06:19.029 --> 06:20.242
No more bets.

06:21.324 --> 06:22.882
Wait. Sid, what did you do?

06:23.798 --> 06:25.585
I went big, like you told me to.

06:25.967 --> 06:28.405
I put all your chips on
red, all my chips on black,

06:28.471 --> 06:29.859
so we cannot lose.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.765
Green! The rare double zero.

06:31.790 --> 06:34.937
What?! Wait, Sid. What the hell?

06:34.962 --> 06:37.093
That's all our money
for the whole weekend.

06:37.118 --> 06:38.867
Well, why didn't you
tell me about green?

06:38.972 --> 06:40.796
Nobody bets on green.

06:40.862 --> 06:43.757
Well, if he had, he
would've won $36,000.

06:45.321 --> 06:46.582
Butt out, dealer.

06:46.613 --> 06:47.637
The name's John.

06:47.693 --> 06:48.693
Damn it!

06:49.950 --> 06:51.648
Ooh, are you guys tapped out?

06:51.822 --> 06:53.671
Free drinks are for gamblers only.

06:54.010 --> 06:55.484
Whiskey soda for John?

06:55.603 --> 06:56.960
Oh, come on!

06:57.628 --> 07:00.257
Margaret, you told me this
trip was gonna cheer me up.

07:00.552 --> 07:02.989
I'm broke, I'm sober,
and we're hanging out

07:03.014 --> 07:05.930
in what apparently is
an all-John casino.

07:06.346 --> 07:10.044
How can I go big in Vegas
when I don't have any money?

07:10.716 --> 07:11.752
I've got a plan.

07:11.994 --> 07:13.753
What are you gonna do,
skin another peacock

07:13.778 --> 07:15.142
and throw it on your back?

07:20.833 --> 07:22.447
What the hell have I gotten into?

07:22.814 --> 07:24.697
Look at the prices on this menu, man.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.353
And I ain't seeing no combos.

07:26.378 --> 07:29.048
Oh, relax, Hank. You're
with Charlie Sell Phones.

07:29.229 --> 07:32.319
Yeah. We're here for the
Henderson bachelor party,

07:32.362 --> 07:33.929
and we expect to be taken care of.

07:34.377 --> 07:36.236
We know Robbie Restaurants.

07:37.056 --> 07:39.197
You know Robbie Restaurants?

07:39.705 --> 07:41.353
We know Robbie Restaurants.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.287
Are you saying in broken English

07:44.331 --> 07:46.205
that you're not gonna
rob the restaurant?

07:47.634 --> 07:49.989
It's a person. Robbie Restaurants.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.856
I don't know what's happening,
but your table's ready.

07:54.541 --> 07:55.586
Okay, forget about it.

07:55.611 --> 07:57.797
We'll get tap waters,
share a side salad.

07:57.822 --> 07:59.622
- Good thing it's just the four of us.
- Yeah.

07:59.824 --> 08:02.423
Hey, guys, over here. Dad,
these are my groomsmen.

08:02.448 --> 08:03.908
Oh, hey.

08:07.142 --> 08:08.470
Oh... Oh.

08:09.744 --> 08:12.030
- Hey, now. It's good to see...
- Their flight got delayed.

08:12.054 --> 08:13.454
They haven't eaten since breakfast.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.767
Well, how the hell did the
plane even lift off the ground?

08:29.267 --> 08:31.775
Did Vernon just order
another seafood tower?

08:33.751 --> 08:35.469
What happened to your
s-smaller friends?

08:35.642 --> 08:37.299
Les, Slim, String Bean and them?

08:37.645 --> 08:38.775
Vernon is String Bean.

08:39.166 --> 08:40.602
What the hell happened to him?

08:41.611 --> 08:44.451
He's actually lost a lot of weight
since that last trip we took to Cabo.

08:45.181 --> 08:46.806
Vernon, looking good.

08:48.864 --> 08:51.321
You been using your
maracas? I know I have.

08:54.236 --> 08:55.329
What the hell is this, man?

08:55.663 --> 08:57.578
Taking my son on trips,
getting him maracas.

08:58.133 --> 08:59.282
Bastard.

09:00.462 --> 09:03.251
Hey, Hank. Can you pass that
bottle of wine? I need to top off.

09:03.649 --> 09:05.541
Yeah, 'cause you're running
through it, you lush.

09:05.565 --> 09:07.480
This the good stuff.
You've got to savor it.

09:07.583 --> 09:08.726
Like this.

09:14.181 --> 09:15.349
Delectable.

09:16.133 --> 09:17.797
See, that way one glass lasts all night.

09:19.726 --> 09:20.881
Look, I'm spending all this money,

09:20.905 --> 09:23.430
and I'm not making no
brownie points with my son.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.781
I'm gonna set this down.
I'm getting the check.

09:26.820 --> 09:28.105
I'd like to say a few words.

09:28.203 --> 09:29.640
Reggie!

09:31.492 --> 09:33.396
Getting to know this man and his friends

09:33.440 --> 09:35.156
has been a privilege and an honor.

09:35.445 --> 09:37.550
Well, that certainly wasa
few words. Thank you, Reggie.

09:37.574 --> 09:39.054
Thanks for opening. Have a seat.

09:39.695 --> 09:41.335
Have a seat, Reggie.

09:44.148 --> 09:45.320
Good evening, everyone.

09:45.765 --> 09:46.765
Hank!

09:50.108 --> 09:54.389
Well, what a fine evening
I have provided for you all.

09:54.722 --> 09:57.803
And to my son and his now
unrecognizable friends,

09:58.264 --> 10:00.902
and his, uh, mama's
side piece down there,

10:01.748 --> 10:03.818
I want to say it's getting late,

10:03.861 --> 10:06.928
so forks up, hands down, got to go.

10:07.905 --> 10:08.910
Dad, it's 7:15.

10:09.209 --> 10:13.467
7:15? Well, what is
this check doing here?

10:13.567 --> 10:14.780
I know I didn't ask for it.

10:16.405 --> 10:18.444
Ooh, this thing is heavy.
I'm scared to open it up.

10:18.507 --> 10:20.514
Oh, just do it, bud. Like a Band-Aid.

10:21.319 --> 10:24.451
All right, no matter
what the figure is inside,

10:24.983 --> 10:26.493
I will not react.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.115
Son of a bitch!

10:33.991 --> 10:35.530
What a deal!

10:43.423 --> 10:45.577
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

10:45.602 --> 10:47.794
It's your ex-husband's friends.

10:49.298 --> 10:51.343
This is the bachelorette party, right?

10:51.648 --> 10:54.413
Sure. But what the heck
are you two doing here?

10:54.952 --> 10:56.610
We want to celebrate
the upcoming nuptials

10:56.653 --> 10:58.350
of our favorite couple, Tony

10:58.394 --> 10:59.917
and... bride.

11:00.062 --> 11:02.839
Yeah, it's not like
we lost all our money,

11:02.872 --> 11:06.466
can't afford drinks, and are
trying to glom on to your thing.

11:07.474 --> 11:10.403
Anyhoo, what are you drinking?

11:10.559 --> 11:12.403
Martinis? Appletinis?

11:12.630 --> 11:14.747
Any tinis going on in here?

11:15.075 --> 11:16.949
Well, we're just staying in tonight.

11:16.981 --> 11:18.341
The wedding's early tomorrow.

11:21.802 --> 11:23.161
Oh.

11:24.895 --> 11:26.474
Looking good, ladies.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.106
This is supposed to cheer me up?

11:29.200 --> 11:31.488
They are whitening their friggin' teeth.

11:31.513 --> 11:32.957
- Uh...
- Let's just go down to the bar

11:32.981 --> 11:35.411
- and play Guess Who's a Prostitute.
- No.

11:35.661 --> 11:38.341
We're gonna have fun tonight.
I'm gonna make this happen.

11:38.622 --> 11:40.505
You want to have fun,
don't you, Lorraine?

11:40.833 --> 11:42.220
Of course I do, but I promised

11:42.256 --> 11:44.800
Reggie and Tony that
I'd-I'd behave myself.

11:44.825 --> 11:46.684
Apparently, when I party in Vegas,

11:46.927 --> 11:48.923
I hurt and embarrass the ones I love.

11:49.559 --> 11:51.261
Hurting and embarrassing
the ones you love

11:51.286 --> 11:53.130
is what Vegas is all about.

11:53.309 --> 11:55.380
Come on, I want to be
Vegas Margaret tonight.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.856
And I bet you there's a Vegas
Lorraine in there somewhere.

11:59.020 --> 12:00.778
Oh, yeah, there is.

12:00.966 --> 12:02.145
She's wild.

12:02.170 --> 12:03.513
She's wild!

12:05.090 --> 12:07.074
I promised... I promised
I'd stay in the room.

12:07.504 --> 12:09.348
Well, then we'll make
the fun come to us.

12:10.039 --> 12:11.345
Come on, you guys.

12:11.832 --> 12:14.323
This is your bride's
last night of freedom.

12:14.348 --> 12:17.035
Don't you want to blow
it out, make it memorable?

12:17.746 --> 12:20.067
Sweetie, I know that you don't know me,

12:20.129 --> 12:22.356
but marriage is boring as hell.

12:22.793 --> 12:25.770
The same guy every single night?

12:26.059 --> 12:29.417
This is your last chance to
grab a beef cake by both cheeks

12:29.442 --> 12:30.746
and let him do his thing.

12:33.784 --> 12:36.370
Well, I don't know what that
was, but I'll take it as a yes.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.932
You twisted my arm. Just give
me a minute to get ready.

12:40.901 --> 12:42.533
Sha-bam!

12:44.299 --> 12:47.025
Ah! I was gonna sneak out
after they fell asleep.

12:47.143 --> 12:48.765
Lorraine!

12:50.610 --> 12:52.908
Thanks again for dinner, Dad.
Want to come hit the tables?

12:53.088 --> 12:54.354
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute, son.

12:54.378 --> 12:56.393
I can't wait to gamble
the money I definitely have.

12:58.393 --> 13:01.611
Okay. I made a few calls,
but none of them panned out.

13:02.307 --> 13:04.416
Turns out that Robbie
Restaurants is dead,

13:04.727 --> 13:07.038
Harry Hubcaps is in jail
and the only guy I could

13:07.072 --> 13:08.682
get on the phone was Mikey Mumbles.

13:08.742 --> 13:10.862
- What did he say?
- Couldn't understand a word of it.

13:11.611 --> 13:14.096
Damn. I'm gonna look like
a idiot in front of my son.

13:14.369 --> 13:15.994
Reggie's just gonna love that.

13:16.143 --> 13:17.307
I can't afford this.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.494
Well, there is one other option.

13:20.282 --> 13:21.532
Dine and dash?

13:21.807 --> 13:24.541
At our age, it's more
"gobble and hobble," but, yes.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.877
- Gentlemen. Is there a problem?
- Oh!

13:27.189 --> 13:28.252
Where the hell did you...?

13:28.580 --> 13:30.328
Wha... What, were you spying on us?

13:30.627 --> 13:32.508
We have a policy of watching anyone

13:32.533 --> 13:35.260
who screams "son of a bitch"
when they get their bill.

13:35.961 --> 13:39.057
You know what, if I can get
Tommy Two Tux on the phone,

13:39.213 --> 13:41.296
you are gonna be done in this town.

13:41.502 --> 13:44.666
Yeah. I just don't think
that's a real person, so...

13:45.745 --> 13:46.900
Don't play dumb.

13:47.299 --> 13:48.869
He always wears two tuxes?

13:49.041 --> 13:52.291
Half black, half white,
split right down the middle?

13:52.612 --> 13:55.189
I believe you're
describing a Batman villain?

13:56.697 --> 13:58.244
Hey, I thought you were right behind us.

13:58.268 --> 14:00.244
Dad, all these women
keep hitting on Reggie.

14:00.330 --> 14:01.345
It's hilarious.

14:02.454 --> 14:03.572
Is there a problem over here?

14:03.596 --> 14:04.861
You the problem, man.

14:05.025 --> 14:07.931
This man is trying to steal my son.

14:08.275 --> 14:09.658
Amber Alert!

14:09.869 --> 14:13.650
- This man trying to steal my little boy.
- Dad, calm down.

14:13.807 --> 14:16.439
- Don't scream "Amber Alert."
- Not trying to steal anyone.

14:16.592 --> 14:18.768
We're talking about an adult
son, by the way. He's 40.

14:18.869 --> 14:22.408
This man is trying to hug my little boy.

14:23.588 --> 14:25.580
Okay, I'm gonna walk away from this.

14:26.830 --> 14:28.142
What's your deal?

14:28.791 --> 14:30.622
Why'd you have to make a
scene and spoil a great dinner?

14:30.646 --> 14:32.801
It was great for you
and your big-ass friends.

14:33.010 --> 14:34.611
Me? All I had is half a salad.

14:35.314 --> 14:37.868
- Forget it.
- Tony, wait a minute.

14:37.893 --> 14:40.205
Sir, you can't leave without
paying your bill. Security.

14:41.008 --> 14:43.150
I found a fingernail in my salad.

14:44.689 --> 14:45.689
Really?

14:45.830 --> 14:47.478
You're gonna bring your goons in?

14:47.603 --> 14:49.290
All right, here's what
is going to happen.

14:49.407 --> 14:53.181
You are going to let us
walk out of here right now.

14:54.129 --> 14:55.129
Take him, too.

15:08.090 --> 15:10.361
That's how Mama likes it. Yeah!

15:11.462 --> 15:14.555
Ooh, yeah, boy. Earn that tuition.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.025
Earn it.

15:16.377 --> 15:17.784
I love Vegas, Lorraine.

15:17.827 --> 15:20.400
I love how you call
your hands dong tongs.

15:21.009 --> 15:22.142
Snap, snap.

15:22.377 --> 15:23.955
Can't control my dong tongs.

15:25.541 --> 15:27.968
Hey, wait, wait. Where's
your little buddy?

15:28.011 --> 15:30.125
Oh, he's nursing a bad breakup.

15:30.150 --> 15:31.556
I've been trying to
cheer him up all night.

15:31.580 --> 15:33.557
- He's probably in the bathroom crying.
- Oh...

15:34.736 --> 15:36.259
Fire in the hole!

15:41.471 --> 15:43.853
My stripper name is Backdraft.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.637
Oh!

15:45.978 --> 15:48.548
Go Vegas Sid!

15:50.118 --> 15:51.181
Oh!

15:51.533 --> 15:53.111
Oh, that must be the other stripper.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.978
Ooh. Look at this one.

16:01.814 --> 16:03.094
Ma'am, we got a noise complaint.

16:03.134 --> 16:06.789
Okay, so your thing is
that you don't work out

16:06.833 --> 16:09.119
so that you look like a regular schlub.

16:09.212 --> 16:10.358
I dig it.

16:10.401 --> 16:12.229
Ma'am, I'm the head of hotel security.

16:12.361 --> 16:14.797
Hey. Hey, can we turn
off the music, please?

16:14.841 --> 16:16.886
Well, how are you gonna dance?

16:16.930 --> 16:18.572
Oh, he looks pissed.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.251
I better cool him off.

16:25.677 --> 16:27.157
Take it off!

16:29.664 --> 16:30.798
Ha, ha, ha.

16:34.290 --> 16:37.167
Hey, Hank. Don't worry,
bud, I'll get us out of here.

16:37.211 --> 16:40.461
Before they took our phones,
I left a message with Tommy Two Tux.

16:40.649 --> 16:44.352
Charlie, I'm sick of your made-up
stories about your made-up friends.

16:44.484 --> 16:45.750
We need a real plan.

16:46.274 --> 16:48.375
We got to get in touch
with Margaret and Sid.

16:51.703 --> 16:53.270
Hank? Charlie?

16:53.719 --> 16:55.070
Margaret, thank God.

16:55.305 --> 16:56.602
Are y'all here to bail us out?

16:57.413 --> 16:58.438
Nope.

17:09.852 --> 17:12.742
My son's wedding's in an hour.
I guess I'm gonna miss it.

17:13.430 --> 17:14.686
Well, what does it matter?

17:14.712 --> 17:16.153
Reggie's his daddy now, anyway.

17:16.881 --> 17:19.233
Shut up, Hank. You know, you...

17:19.624 --> 17:22.741
You know what your
problem is, Hank is...

17:28.482 --> 17:29.600
Mother of my child.

17:31.288 --> 17:34.061
- I shouldn't have come here.
- Me either.

17:34.850 --> 17:37.280
I wish I was home, looking
at pictures of John.

17:37.741 --> 17:39.153
I also wish I had some pants.

17:39.178 --> 17:41.100
It's freezing here in the big house.

17:42.639 --> 17:45.905
Can't believe that Tommy Two
Tux didn't show up for us.

17:46.358 --> 17:47.889
Will you listen to the three of you?

17:48.163 --> 17:50.154
You know what? Vegas
Margaret is not gonna sit here

17:50.178 --> 17:52.072
and listen to you sad sacks complaining.

17:52.303 --> 17:53.591
Here's the deal, Hank.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.077
Reggie has more money than you do.

17:56.170 --> 17:58.881
Reggie will always have
more money than you do,

17:59.170 --> 18:02.458
and he will be better looking, and
he will be more charming...

18:02.483 --> 18:03.741
Get to the point.

18:04.397 --> 18:05.842
You can't control all of that.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.482
What you can control is your
relationship with your son,

18:08.507 --> 18:10.984
so stop moping and go talk to him.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.576
And you, Sid, you can
have a John pity party

18:13.601 --> 18:16.499
for the rest of your life,
or you can choose to move on.

18:16.788 --> 18:19.492
And Charlie, it's time to stop lying.

18:19.882 --> 18:21.693
We love you. You don't
have to keep making up

18:21.718 --> 18:24.515
these crazy stories
about your fake past.

18:25.267 --> 18:26.765
Ah.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.933
If it ain't Charlie Sell Phones.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.546
- You're looking good.
- Tommy Two Tux.

18:33.999 --> 18:35.077
You're not.

18:36.112 --> 18:37.921
- You were saying, Margaret?
- Oh.

18:38.437 --> 18:41.022
Marone. Get a load of the
outfit on this broad, eh?

18:43.546 --> 18:44.849
Look, you guys are free to go.

18:44.874 --> 18:45.896
- Oh.
- Yeah.

18:45.921 --> 18:48.702
Oh, FYI... uh, that
manager at that restaurant

18:48.725 --> 18:50.778
- Yeah.
- Yeah. He's gonna be mopping stalls

18:50.803 --> 18:53.631
at the Hard Rock from now on.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.014
Charlie, you came through.

18:57.639 --> 19:00.482
Looks like I'm gonna make
my son's wedding after all.

19:02.356 --> 19:03.412
Lorraine.

19:04.568 --> 19:05.576
Lorraine!

19:08.068 --> 19:09.100
Last call.

19:09.449 --> 19:10.568
Vodka tonic.

19:17.365 --> 19:19.165
- Are you ready?
- Ready, man. I'm ready, man.

19:19.248 --> 19:21.608
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Let's do it. Let's do it.

19:21.982 --> 19:22.985
Oh, there you are, Dad.

19:23.943 --> 19:25.193
Thanks for dressing up.

19:26.357 --> 19:28.381
Hey, guys. Will you, uh,
excuse us for a minute?

19:28.469 --> 19:29.615
Yeah.

19:31.028 --> 19:32.548
You know, there's food in the hallway.

19:35.498 --> 19:36.975
Listen...

19:37.264 --> 19:38.795
I want to apologize.

19:39.592 --> 19:41.756
I know I was acting crazy,

19:42.568 --> 19:43.615
'cause...

19:43.928 --> 19:46.709
I just feel like Reggie's
replacing me, man.

19:46.857 --> 19:47.935
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:48.467 --> 19:49.779
Come on, I like Reggie.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.287
He's my friend.

19:51.872 --> 19:52.872
But you're my dad.

19:53.227 --> 19:54.506
There's no replacing you.

19:55.658 --> 19:56.690
And if this is about Reggie hosting

19:56.714 --> 19:58.634
- the wedding, then...
- No, it's more than that.

19:59.025 --> 20:00.618
Y'all just seem like you're closer.

20:00.704 --> 20:05.204
You know, with the trips,
the hugs, all the inside jokes.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.848
Yeah, but that's never been your style.

20:06.922 --> 20:08.291
No, it ha-never has.

20:08.704 --> 20:09.711
But I want it to be.

20:10.086 --> 20:12.305
I want to be there for you from now on.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.186
And I want to be a part of your wedding.

20:14.406 --> 20:15.429
I'd love that.

20:15.646 --> 20:18.432
All right. And I'm gonna
walk you down the aisle.

20:18.969 --> 20:20.579
You ever been to a wedding?
That's not something...

20:20.603 --> 20:24.860
I'm walking you down that aisle.

20:24.885 --> 20:26.561
- Okay, Pop. Okay, okay.
- Okay.

20:26.837 --> 20:29.189
- So, how you feeling?
- Uh...

20:29.275 --> 20:31.657
- a little nervous, to be honest.
- Well, that's natural, man.

20:31.681 --> 20:33.470
You don't have to be strong, okay?

20:33.517 --> 20:35.144
'Cause you can be weak

20:35.188 --> 20:38.191
knowing that your daddy
is gonna be your rock.

20:39.888 --> 20:42.267
This... this my baby.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.063
My little baby boy.

20:44.308 --> 20:45.321
You get...

20:45.372 --> 20:47.017
Oh, I'm not gonna make it.

20:47.192 --> 20:50.543
Oh, I'm just... just joyful.

20:52.248 --> 20:54.004
You done found your queen.

20:54.074 --> 20:55.338
All right, then.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.152
Oh, he gonna...

20:58.051 --> 20:59.371
Ooh!

21:00.848 --> 21:04.316
Oh, that's my son! Lord!

21:05.863 --> 21:07.027
Here she comes.

21:08.176 --> 21:11.848
Oh!

21:12.051 --> 21:13.729
She look like a angel,

21:13.754 --> 21:16.402
like she's just floating on in.

21:17.168 --> 21:20.496
Oh. Oh!

21:23.410 --> 21:26.339
Eyes on the prize. She's
coming to get you, Tony...

21:28.675 --> 21:30.792
For ever and ever and ever and ever.
