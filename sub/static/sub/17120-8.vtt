WEBVTT

00:02.141 --> 00:04.821
I know what happened back
in 1991 in Iraq

00:05.095 --> 00:07.415
and I know you're rotten.

00:07.453 --> 00:09.653
You're a medic, Reed. Help him!

00:14.100 --> 00:15.488
It's oké.

00:16.460 --> 00:18.700
'In 1991, I was just a boy.'

00:18.740 --> 00:21.180
That's when they came to my village.

00:21.218 --> 00:22.356
Who?

00:22.660 --> 00:25.300
Henry Reed and his army friend.

00:25.355 --> 00:26.846
A man called Stone.

00:28.198 --> 00:30.475
I won't give up until I find
your daughter.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.979
Do you believe that?

00:31.980 --> 00:33.393
No!

00:33.512 --> 00:35.632
PEOPLE SCREAM

00:37.286 --> 00:39.406
I want to sleep in the shed

00:39.640 --> 00:42.760
and I need you to lock me in.

00:44.557 --> 00:48.237
I'm coming, but I ask that you take
this man into custody also.

00:48.261 --> 00:49.347
On what grounds?

00:49.372 --> 00:53.222
On the grounds that he abducted
Sophie Giroux and Alice Webster.

00:55.821 --> 00:58.336
You're saying he framed my husband?

00:59.900 --> 01:01.420
You're dying.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.659
You're lost, my love,

01:03.660 --> 01:05.940
and the tide is coming in.

01:06.003 --> 01:08.895
Mummy! Lucy!

01:09.292 --> 01:11.212
Gettrick knows I suspect him.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.557
If I'm right, he knows
I have seen him for who he is

01:13.620 --> 01:15.660
and he'll already be gone.

01:17.752 --> 01:20.912
You can have this if you're good.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.900
You will be good...

01:24.931 --> 01:27.351
won't you, Alice?

01:27.566 --> 01:29.218
I'll be good.

01:43.300 --> 01:46.019
Where's Baptiste?

01:46.020 --> 01:48.579
He's upstairs.

01:48.580 --> 01:51.099
He's trying to see if there's
anything Adam left behind

01:51.100 --> 01:53.180
to show us where he went.

01:53.220 --> 01:54.659
Well, if you've found something,

01:54.660 --> 01:56.779
you should be calling the police,
not me.

01:56.780 --> 01:58.380
Yeah. Just come and look, Sam.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.820
What is it?

02:03.860 --> 02:05.819
Look.

02:05.820 --> 02:07.500
There.

02:27.420 --> 02:30.140
Do you remember when you told her
you couldn't get the time off work

02:30.180 --> 02:32.020
to go camping?

02:32.060 --> 02:34.259
How much she cried?

02:34.260 --> 02:36.179
And then the minute
she left for school,

02:36.180 --> 02:39.900
you went straight up to her room and
you put up all those stars for her.

02:41.420 --> 02:45.659
Kept her quiet about camping
for about a day.

02:45.660 --> 02:47.700
The pattern's the same, Sam.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.780
It can't be a coincidence, can it?

03:04.540 --> 03:06.979
GIRL SIGHS

03:06.980 --> 03:09.420
You're going to be oké.

03:09.460 --> 03:11.020
You'll get better, you'll see.

03:11.060 --> 03:13.500
You just need to try
and drink something.

03:14.700 --> 03:18.580
Please, Sophie, you HAVE to
drink something. Just try.

03:23.980 --> 03:27.740
The day I arrived,
he threw me down here

03:27.780 --> 03:30.299
and I was crying.

03:30.300 --> 03:33.940
You didn't tell me everything
was going to be oké.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.619
You said that you didn't know.

03:35.620 --> 03:39.260
You said that you were scared,
just like I was.

03:41.060 --> 03:44.179
But you promised that you'd
be here, no matter what,

03:44.180 --> 03:46.380
for as long as you could.

03:46.420 --> 03:48.860
That's all you COULD promise.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.740
Well, I'm here, Sophie.

03:57.580 --> 03:59.779
I'm still here.

03:59.780 --> 04:02.860
HATCH CLANKS OPEN

04:14.500 --> 04:17.380
What were you talking about?

04:17.420 --> 04:20.100
And what are you doing out
of your corner?

04:21.339 --> 04:25.259
You know I can see everything you do
down here, don't you?

04:25.260 --> 04:27.220
What were you saying to her?

04:27.260 --> 04:30.180
If you don't do something,
she's going to die.

04:30.220 --> 04:32.180
You think I don't know that?

04:33.340 --> 04:34.939
I'm doing everything I can.

04:34.940 --> 04:38.300
She's in too much pain to eat.
She needs the hospital...

04:38.340 --> 04:40.819
Get back in your place.

04:40.820 --> 04:42.980
You want to end up like Lena?

04:43.020 --> 04:45.500
Then don't EVER tell me
what to do again.

04:47.340 --> 04:50.260
It should be you, not Sophie,
that's like this.

04:51.460 --> 04:53.940
Why can't you behave, Alice?

04:53.980 --> 04:58.699
Why is it you still don't
understand how to behave

04:58.700 --> 05:01.339
and shut that ugly mouth of yours?

05:01.340 --> 05:03.379
You can hit me all you want.

05:03.380 --> 05:06.620
But if you don't do something,
she's going to die!

05:08.460 --> 05:11.299
What are you going to tell Lucy?

05:11.300 --> 05:15.740
How are you going to tell her
that you let her mummy die?

You all right?

06:45.740 --> 06:48.259
I'm in trouble.

06:48.260 --> 06:50.180
Oké.

06:51.220 --> 06:54.300
I can't help you unless you tell
me what kind of trouble.

06:56.940 --> 07:01.580
You know when we went for a drink
at that bierhaus last Wednesday?

07:01.620 --> 07:04.659
You, me and Henry. I do.

07:04.660 --> 07:06.660
We talked about Iraq.

07:06.700 --> 07:09.539
Henry got angry and stormed off.

07:09.540 --> 07:12.980
He really hated being reminded
of that night... Get to the point.

07:14.620 --> 07:16.820
I recorded our conversation.

07:16.860 --> 07:19.300
You and Henry discussing everything,

07:19.340 --> 07:23.819
and after Henry went, we talked
about other things, didn't we?

07:23.820 --> 07:28.699
About the girls we were
with back then.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.580
Are you blackmailing me?

07:30.620 --> 07:32.459
No.

07:32.460 --> 07:34.140
No, no, no, we're friends.

07:34.180 --> 07:36.539
We go back a long way.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.340
I simply...
I want you to understand...

07:40.980 --> 07:43.699
I protected you
when no-one else would.

07:43.700 --> 07:46.859
I saved your life,
you ungrateful little shit!

07:46.860 --> 07:48.820
I don't want to hurt you, Adrian,

07:48.860 --> 07:52.100
but you're not going to want to do
what I'm going to ask you.

07:55.740 --> 07:58.260
(I really need you to.)

08:02.940 --> 08:05.260
If there was any other way...

08:06.980 --> 08:09.460
I've tried everything.

08:11.900 --> 08:13.900
What do you want?

08:15.540 --> 08:18.380
What exactly have you done, Adam?

08:22.860 --> 08:28.019
I'm just saying,
once you know, you know.

08:28.020 --> 08:32.100
No point in messing about,
and that's all I'm saying.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.340
Yeah, but I don't know.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.260
How do you ever know?

08:38.100 --> 08:40.139
A leap of faith.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.179
Oh, cos that worked out
for you and Mum?

08:42.220 --> 08:45.979
I'm not saying it
always worked out, oké?

08:45.980 --> 08:48.859
Why are you in such a hurry
for me to get married? I'm not.

08:48.860 --> 08:52.420
I just think it would be nice
knowing that you're settled.

08:52.460 --> 08:54.860
Oké, so what about you?

08:57.180 --> 08:59.819
Are you seriously going to tell
me that massive Christmas present

08:59.820 --> 09:02.020
in the corner is just for a mate?

09:03.300 --> 09:06.019
Come on, what's her name?

09:06.020 --> 09:07.739
PHONE RINGS

09:07.740 --> 09:10.179
Saved by the bell. Excuse me.

09:10.180 --> 09:13.420
Mobile, Dad. Seriously,
we've got to get you a mobile phone.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.460
Henry Reed.

09:18.300 --> 09:21.139
Now?

09:21.140 --> 09:24.580
Um... oké, oké.

09:25.820 --> 09:28.259
Fine.

09:28.260 --> 09:30.060
Can't you just tell me...

09:31.100 --> 09:33.139
No.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.579
I understand.

09:35.580 --> 09:38.699
Dad, I've got to go.

09:38.700 --> 09:41.859
I got to dash, I'm sorry,
but I'll see you next week, yeah?

09:41.860 --> 09:44.300
This time next week, yeah.

10:00.940 --> 10:03.020
What are we doing here?

10:03.060 --> 10:05.220
What's done is done.

10:05.260 --> 10:07.580
You believe that, don't you?

10:07.620 --> 10:11.419
"The past cannot be cured" -
you ever heard that?

10:11.420 --> 10:13.459
There's no point dwelling on
what's happened.

10:13.460 --> 10:17.419
If we did, you, me, and Adam,
we wouldn't be here today.

10:17.420 --> 10:19.780
We can't go back and fix things.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.300
Tell me why I'm here.

10:24.100 --> 10:26.540
Before we go in...

10:27.860 --> 10:30.020
...Adam has us.

10:32.220 --> 10:36.699
He has a recording,
what happened in Iraq.

10:36.700 --> 10:41.180
Just remember that he has us
saying everything we did.

10:43.860 --> 10:47.300
Henry, we served our country
with honour.

10:47.340 --> 10:49.500
We put our lives on the line.

10:49.540 --> 10:52.859
Imagine if the only thing we're
remembered for in our lives

10:52.860 --> 10:55.820
is that one horrific fucking night!

11:17.820 --> 11:20.300
She's dying, Henry.

11:20.340 --> 11:22.820
I need you to make her better.

11:30.220 --> 11:31.739
Is this all you've found?

11:31.740 --> 11:35.419
I have searched as thoroughly as
I can without disturbing the scene.

11:35.420 --> 11:38.780
But, Mr Webster,
the absence of evidence

11:38.820 --> 11:41.059
is not the evidence of absence.

11:41.060 --> 11:42.899
You're a detective.

11:42.900 --> 11:46.980
Why can't you call the police,
tell them to find Adam?

11:47.020 --> 11:49.419
I have no special power
in this regard.

11:49.420 --> 11:51.460
The police here do not trust me.

11:51.500 --> 11:55.300
Their involvement will only
slow us down. The man left quickly.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.939
Time is of the essence.

11:56.940 --> 11:59.780
WE must find Adam Gettrick. How?

12:02.420 --> 12:05.180
We hope he left something behind.

12:23.069 --> 12:25.579
I've been trying to get hold of
Detective Lenhart for two days.

12:25.580 --> 12:28.019
It's very important that
I speak to him.

12:28.020 --> 12:31.979
He sent me an SMS the other day,
saying he needed to go away.

12:31.980 --> 12:34.739
I covered for him, saying he is ill.

12:34.740 --> 12:36.859
Get away where?
You know Lenhart, right?

12:36.860 --> 12:39.379
Off writing songs and poetry
probably.

12:39.380 --> 12:41.740
He was looking into
something for me.

12:41.780 --> 12:43.860
Do you mind if I check his desk?

12:45.060 --> 12:47.300
Maybe you'd prefer
that I tell your boss

12:47.340 --> 12:49.540
you're covering for
Detective Lenhart?

13:09.300 --> 13:12.099
Look at this.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.219
Baptiste!

13:14.220 --> 13:15.740
Yes.

13:17.780 --> 13:20.460
You've found something?

13:24.100 --> 13:26.260
Swiss francs.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.180
Wait a second.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.860
This was taken in Switzerland.

13:49.660 --> 13:52.940
A man like Adam Gettrick, to keep
his crimes hidden for so long,

13:52.980 --> 13:56.020
he would have anticipated
an eventuality like this.

13:56.060 --> 13:58.020
He would have a contingency.

13:58.060 --> 14:00.539
I have a friend at Interpol.

14:00.540 --> 14:04.020
He will explore this connection
to Switzerland.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.860
Mark Walsh! How is the new job?

14:07.140 --> 14:09.580
I have a favour to ask, my friend.

14:47.340 --> 14:50.579
If Gettrick's gone to Switzerland,
we might've already lost him.

14:50.580 --> 14:52.019
Baptiste knows what he's doing.

14:52.020 --> 14:54.580
He's been right so far, hasn't he,
about everything?

14:54.620 --> 14:57.299
No, not everything.

14:57.300 --> 15:00.060
Not about Alice.

15:01.220 --> 15:04.379
It seems that Adam Gettrick's uncle
is on the electoral roll

15:04.380 --> 15:07.100
in Switzerland, in a small town
called Vaaren.

15:07.140 --> 15:10.539
We don't know the exact address,
only the area,

15:10.540 --> 15:12.739
but it's better than nothing.

15:12.740 --> 15:15.780
We could be there by morning.

15:24.180 --> 15:27.060
GUNSHOT ECHOES

15:54.420 --> 15:56.419
Go back to sleep.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.660
Did you get anything?

16:00.100 --> 16:02.380
I said I'd take care of you.

16:04.300 --> 16:08.220
We're going to be happy here,
Sophie. Just you see.

16:31.180 --> 16:33.180
I've tried all I can.

16:34.420 --> 16:36.659
I've looked it up.
I think it might be her appendix.

16:36.660 --> 16:39.899
She's got a fever.
There's a pain in her side.

16:39.900 --> 16:43.739
You were a medic for ten years.
There must be something you can do.

16:43.740 --> 16:45.579
No.

16:45.580 --> 16:48.298
No, I... don't want any part of this.

16:48.323 --> 16:50.283
If you don't help her,
the girl will die.

16:50.322 --> 16:52.916
Her temperature is off the charts,
the pain is getting worse.

16:52.940 --> 16:55.060
Now you can do something to help.

16:55.100 --> 16:57.580
Adrian, call the police!
For Christ's sake, Henry!

16:57.620 --> 16:58.820
Call them the police now!

16:58.860 --> 17:03.059
He has us admitting what we did. So?

17:03.060 --> 17:07.180
Maybe people deserve
to know the truth.

17:07.220 --> 17:09.940
Because of us...

17:09.980 --> 17:12.380
that little girl died.

17:15.460 --> 17:18.060
I'm not going to make the same
mistake again.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.339
No.

17:22.339 --> 17:26.819
I love Sophie and you're going to
help me make her better.

17:28.660 --> 17:31.260
Adrian...

17:32.740 --> 17:35.139
Come on.

17:35.140 --> 17:37.220
Jesus, Adrian, please!

17:38.540 --> 17:40.900
All you need to do is help her.

17:42.260 --> 17:44.779
The only help that girl needs
is surgery.

17:44.780 --> 17:48.140
Fine, then that's what we'll do.
She needs a hospital! No!

17:49.980 --> 17:52.660
Right here.

17:58.020 --> 18:00.940
I'll, um...

18:00.980 --> 18:03.380
I'll need my medical kit.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.500
I have to go.
I've a garrison dinner.

18:11.900 --> 18:13.819
Oh, well, I'm sorry
to be keeping you(!)

18:13.820 --> 18:16.180
If I don't go,
there'll be questions.

18:18.300 --> 18:21.859
If I was going to call the police,
I'd have done it by now.

18:21.860 --> 18:24.699
You've got a chance to do
the right thing, Adrian.

18:24.700 --> 18:28.700
You've finally got
a chance to do the right thing.

18:28.740 --> 18:32.819
Come on. If she doesn't get surgery
in hospital, she will die.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.859
Have you been drinking?

18:34.860 --> 18:37.899
What the hell's that got to
do with anything?

18:37.900 --> 18:40.780
We can't risk being stopped.
I'll drive.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.420
Kit's in the office.

19:21.220 --> 19:23.419
Shit!

19:23.420 --> 19:25.659
Er, I wasn't thinking.

19:25.660 --> 19:28.620
It's next door.
The medical kit's next door.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.659
I really am sorry, Henry.

19:38.660 --> 19:41.699
I did not want this to happen.

19:41.700 --> 19:44.939
I'm just trying to help her.

19:44.940 --> 19:46.939
That's all.

19:46.940 --> 19:49.020
I just...

20:30.060 --> 20:32.900
GUNSHOT

20:34.940 --> 20:38.379
HE ROARS

20:38.380 --> 20:41.820
RAPID BREATHING

22:02.060 --> 22:03.460
You're not well, Sophie.

22:06.140 --> 22:08.500
I know how much pain you must be in.

22:09.580 --> 22:12.620
But the medicine I've given you
is going to get you through this...

22:12.660 --> 22:13.780
I promise.

22:19.740 --> 22:22.139
You know Alice inside out.

22:22.140 --> 22:23.580
Don't you?

22:25.020 --> 22:26.140
You look like her.

22:28.300 --> 22:33.340
Even down to the tattoo
she did for you. Like hers.

22:33.380 --> 22:36.700
You know her better
than even her parents did.

22:38.820 --> 22:40.859
And now...

22:40.860 --> 22:43.259
I need you to be her.

22:43.260 --> 22:45.740
What... What do you mean?

22:45.780 --> 22:48.579
Just until you're better.

22:48.580 --> 22:50.540
I'm letting you go, Sophie.

22:52.820 --> 22:57.100
'Just enough time to get you
to the hospital. To get treatment.

23:00.180 --> 23:03.219
'I can't bear the thought
of you dying.

23:03.220 --> 23:05.340
'But I can't risk taking you myself,

23:05.380 --> 23:08.499
'so you'll have to push past
the pain.

23:08.500 --> 23:09.500
'Alice.'

23:11.180 --> 23:13.300
I don't understand that...

23:15.020 --> 23:17.500
Everything is prepared.

23:22.100 --> 23:26.459
If you're going out there,
out into the world,

23:26.460 --> 23:30.019
there are people who want
to try and take you away.

23:30.020 --> 23:33.779
If they find out you really are,

23:33.780 --> 23:36.579
they would take you back to France,

23:36.580 --> 23:40.060
away from me, away from Lucy.

23:45.460 --> 23:47.460
This way's safer.

23:50.140 --> 23:54.580
'If they think you're Alice,
you'll stay here.

23:54.620 --> 23:56.340
'Close by.

23:56.380 --> 23:57.659
'They'll never believe me.

23:57.660 --> 24:02.100
'Well, why not?
You even sound like her now.

24:03.740 --> 24:05.090
'And you know what?'

24:05.980 --> 24:09.499
Alice's parents want her back.

24:09.742 --> 24:13.395
And sometimes that's all it takes.

24:16.902 --> 24:19.503
So when they ask you,

24:20.379 --> 24:22.740
you tell them this man took you.

24:23.179 --> 24:24.739
Look at him.

24:26.580 --> 24:28.140
Remember him.

24:28.180 --> 24:30.459
Who is he? It doesn't matter.

24:30.460 --> 24:34.300
All that matters
is that you do as I tell you.

24:36.860 --> 24:41.739
Just do what we talked about
and you can come home to us.

24:41.740 --> 24:45.580
Back to Lucy.
You just have to be a good girl.

24:46.820 --> 24:49.619
You will be a good girl, won't you?

24:49.620 --> 24:52.260
Yes.

24:54.140 --> 24:56.940
You remember what happened to Lena?

24:56.980 --> 25:00.379
You wouldn't want that to happen
to Lucy?

25:00.380 --> 25:03.140
No. You be a good girl.

25:03.180 --> 25:07.500
And when you're better,
we can be a family again.

25:26.420 --> 25:28.020
RINGING

25:29.460 --> 25:31.059
Not now, Adam.

25:31.060 --> 25:32.179
It's happening, Adrian.

25:32.180 --> 25:34.139
I don't want anything to do with it.

25:34.140 --> 25:36.860
Well, you're part of it.
It's just the way it is.

25:38.020 --> 25:42.659
If people start asking questions
or they want to do a DNA test,

25:42.660 --> 25:45.259
I will need you to step in.

25:45.635 --> 25:48.117
They need to know it's Alice.

25:48.142 --> 25:49.542
I understand.

25:58.940 --> 26:00.499
Dad!

26:00.500 --> 26:01.980
Oh!

26:02.254 --> 26:04.254
Why'd you want to meet me here?

26:06.754 --> 26:11.420
I... was... at the doctor's
down the road there,

26:11.460 --> 26:13.540
and I just...

26:14.940 --> 26:19.620
Well, I just
ended up sitting here.

26:19.660 --> 26:21.660
Is everything all right?

26:27.340 --> 26:32.620
Ever since you were young,
you followed in my footsteps.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.660
Joining the army,
climbing the ranks,

26:36.700 --> 26:39.339
even getting into country music.

26:39.340 --> 26:43.979
Your mother always said it was
because you looked up to me,

26:43.980 --> 26:45.900
but I always knew that wasn't it.

26:47.660 --> 26:49.060
It...

26:49.100 --> 26:52.499
It was just...

26:52.500 --> 26:57.260
that we were so similar,

26:57.300 --> 27:00.740
so much like the same person...

27:02.980 --> 27:06.340
...and I... I'm sorry about that!

27:10.820 --> 27:14.060
I've been a good dad, haven't I?

27:14.100 --> 27:15.499
Dad...

27:15.500 --> 27:19.140
I want you to remember me
as a good dad,

27:19.180 --> 27:23.819
as the man who indulged you,

27:23.820 --> 27:29.140
who pushed you so high on the swing
your mother nearly had an aneurysm.

27:30.700 --> 27:33.339
You remember that, don't you?

27:33.340 --> 27:35.180
Of course I do.

27:36.780 --> 27:43.260
It's that...
soon I won't remember that.

27:45.460 --> 27:50.620
Soon, I...
I might not even remember you.

27:52.620 --> 27:56.460
There'll be pieces missing,
the doctor said,

27:56.500 --> 27:59.580
parts of me that fall away.

28:02.340 --> 28:05.019
But even if I can't remember you,

28:05.020 --> 28:09.739
love, please,

28:09.740 --> 28:13.420
whatever happens, what anyone says,

28:13.460 --> 28:15.180
if ever...

28:18.460 --> 28:21.100
Remember me for the good things.

28:28.620 --> 28:34.900
RINGING

28:37.500 --> 28:38.979
Baptiste.

28:38.980 --> 28:40.099
Julien.

28:40.100 --> 28:42.619
I thought you should know,
the picture Mrs Webster found,

28:42.620 --> 28:43.900
the rollercoaster,

28:43.940 --> 28:48.339
Jorn Lenhart looked into it
and he found another abducted girl.

28:48.340 --> 28:50.019
Lena Garber.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.140
I spoke to her mother this morning.

28:52.180 --> 28:55.579
She'd spoken to Jorn the other day
about a friend of the family.

28:55.580 --> 28:56.820
Adam Gettrick.

28:58.140 --> 28:59.940
Adam was involved. You were right.

28:59.980 --> 29:03.939
I wish I was able to feel joy that
you've joined me at this conclusion,

29:03.940 --> 29:06.220
but that's not the case,

29:06.260 --> 29:10.219
because Jorn now is missing
and Adam Gettrick is free.

29:10.220 --> 29:14.900
I can't help thinking that...
if you're right about this,

29:14.940 --> 29:17.197
maybe you've been right
about other things.

29:17.223 --> 29:21.262
You must remove yourself from your own
feeling to see something as it truly is.

29:21.420 --> 29:23.819
Your father's not the man
you thought him to be.

29:23.820 --> 29:25.683
Looks like we're nearly there.

29:26.780 --> 29:29.539
Is that Sam Webster? Where are you?

29:29.540 --> 29:33.819
Switzerland.
Looking for Mr Gettrick.

29:33.820 --> 29:36.259
No, Julien, stay where you are.

29:36.260 --> 29:39.299
Gettrick could be dangerous.
I'll contact the Swiss police.

29:39.300 --> 29:44.370
If I'd listened to you up till this moment,
Staff Sergeant Stone, we wouldn't be where we are.

30:05.700 --> 30:06.820
Engel, it's Eve.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.060
I need your help tracking a phone.

30:11.220 --> 30:13.500
Yeah, Julien Baptiste.

30:19.780 --> 30:22.139
Hello. Bonjour. Have you seen her?

30:22.140 --> 30:23.979
Have you seen him?

30:23.980 --> 30:25.860
Merci.

30:25.900 --> 30:28.019
THEY SPEAK IN FRENCH

30:28.020 --> 30:29.380
Merci.

30:31.100 --> 30:34.140
Hi. Good afternoon.
I'm looking for this man.

30:41.060 --> 30:45.260
Adam Gettrick.
I still can't get my head round it.

30:45.300 --> 30:46.740
I know.

30:46.780 --> 30:49.020
He's one of us. Y'know, I know him.

30:49.060 --> 30:54.059
How can one of your own
do something like this?

30:54.060 --> 30:57.819
Look, you saw those stars
in that basement, Sam.

30:57.820 --> 31:01.659
You know that Julien
was right about Adam.

31:01.660 --> 31:04.619
But how do you know that
he's not right about Alice?

31:04.620 --> 31:07.139
That she might not still be alive?

31:07.140 --> 31:10.699
Wanting something to be true
doesn't make it true, Gem.

31:10.700 --> 31:13.459
But you must wonder.
All the differences.

31:13.460 --> 31:15.700
Y'know - the way she was
when she came back.

31:15.740 --> 31:16.980
I don't know.

31:21.260 --> 31:22.660
What happened to us, Sam?

31:24.340 --> 31:28.847
We managed - we struggled on
for 11 years after she was taken.

31:29.101 --> 31:31.341
What were we doing,
just fooling ourselves

31:31.366 --> 31:33.835
that it could all just go back
to how it was before she went?

31:33.860 --> 31:36.699
We got through it then
because I loved you.

31:36.700 --> 31:40.580
You and Matthew and Alice...
and I still do.

31:42.660 --> 31:44.780
That didn't stop.

31:46.060 --> 31:47.460
Hey.

32:01.380 --> 32:04.740
None of this is real.

32:04.780 --> 32:06.220
Any of it.

32:06.260 --> 32:11.540
You are here.
That's all that matters.

32:11.580 --> 32:14.460
You are opening yourself to
possibility.

32:20.140 --> 32:22.220
PHONE BEEPS

32:29.980 --> 32:31.860
Thank you. You didn't need to.

32:31.900 --> 32:34.020
It's all part of the service.
Here you go.

32:42.140 --> 32:44.140
Hey, hold on.

32:46.780 --> 32:49.660
This woman... do you know her?

32:51.260 --> 32:54.499
Yeah. She was here the other day.
What?

32:54.500 --> 32:57.700
I mean, she looked different,
she had shorter hair.

32:58.106 --> 33:02.465
I was stupid enough to ask for her phone number -
way out of my league, you know...

33:02.708 --> 33:03.985
You saw her here?

33:04.010 --> 33:05.010
Yeah.

33:06.220 --> 33:08.539
That's not possible.
What are you talking about?

33:08.540 --> 33:11.179
Where did she go when she left?

33:11.180 --> 33:14.219
There's a footbridge
on the way out of town,

33:14.220 --> 33:17.337
it crosses the river...
she went into the woods.

33:17.596 --> 33:18.705
Thank you.

33:19.345 --> 33:20.846
Come on, Gemma.

33:22.028 --> 33:24.940
Sometimes Hilde speaks.

33:53.420 --> 33:57.460
How could he have seen her?
It doesn't make sense.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.900
BARKING

34:04.140 --> 34:05.180
It's oké.

34:20.620 --> 34:22.580
What is it? Stay here.

34:28.179 --> 34:32.620
In the disappearance of
Sophie Giroux, there was one clue.

34:32.659 --> 34:35.020
A camper van spotted nearby.

34:36.460 --> 34:38.940
The number plate is from Germany.

34:40.940 --> 34:43.380
What do you think's through there?
We'll soon find out.

34:43.420 --> 34:47.379
Hey, wait. Sergeant Stone is
sending help. We must be cautious.

34:47.380 --> 34:49.059
Adam Gettrick is a dangerous man.

34:49.060 --> 34:50.380
We've come this far.

34:50.420 --> 34:53.739
And if he is up there, he'll know
we're here already, won't he?

34:53.739 --> 34:56.379
I need to know
what happened to our daughter,

34:56.380 --> 34:58.819
and Gettrick's going to tell me.

34:58.820 --> 35:01.660
This ends now.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.899
Come on, let's go.

35:03.900 --> 35:06.219
We've learned a great deal already.

35:06.220 --> 35:07.940
We don't need to rush now.

35:10.340 --> 35:11.699
BARKING CONTINUES

35:11.700 --> 35:13.820
Hey, there's a path, this way.

36:54.020 --> 37:01.900
CREAKING

37:49.660 --> 37:51.700
HE PANTS

37:53.420 --> 37:54.740
Argh!

37:56.380 --> 37:58.060
Julien?!

38:02.460 --> 38:04.220
Sam?

38:08.020 --> 38:09.540
GUNSHOT

38:11.460 --> 38:13.419
Sam!! Sam!

38:13.420 --> 38:15.419
GUNSHOT

38:15.420 --> 38:16.979
Sam!

38:16.980 --> 38:19.300
Sam, Sam! Sam!

38:22.780 --> 38:26.020
SCREAMING

38:29.460 --> 38:33.539
Shut her up.
Get her to stop that noise!

38:33.540 --> 38:35.459
Shut her up!

38:35.460 --> 38:38.460
Lucy! Lucy, I told you to...

38:38.500 --> 38:39.820
What, you...

38:43.140 --> 38:46.260
I told you to keep her quiet!

38:49.580 --> 38:52.019
Lucy? Lucy? Where's she gone?
Where's she...?

38:52.020 --> 38:53.219
Go. Go find her!

38:53.220 --> 38:55.060
If they take her, it's on your head!

38:55.100 --> 39:10.180
Lucy!

39:11.500 --> 39:13.060
SHE SCREAMS

39:37.540 --> 39:40.420
IN FRENCH

39:42.380 --> 39:43.820
Sophie!

40:02.700 --> 40:04.940
Sophie, stop! Stop!

40:10.220 --> 40:13.100
Help! Can you help us, please?

40:16.260 --> 40:18.940
SHOUTING

40:38.420 --> 40:41.500
HE MOANS IN PAIN

40:43.100 --> 40:44.540
Arrgh!

40:48.380 --> 40:50.020
THEY SPEAK IN FRENCH

40:51.940 --> 40:53.460
Put your hands behind your back!

40:53.500 --> 40:54.820
It's my family!

40:54.860 --> 40:55.939
Hands behind your back now!

40:55.940 --> 40:57.380
They're my family!

40:57.420 --> 40:58.740
What did you do?

41:24.380 --> 41:26.579
IN FRENCH

41:26.580 --> 41:28.460
Sophie.

41:39.180 --> 41:40.619
They've taken her.

41:40.620 --> 41:43.339
No. She's safe. That's all.

41:43.340 --> 41:45.460
It's over.
I'll never be allowed to see her.

41:45.500 --> 41:49.139
No! Whatever he told you, no-one
will take your daughter from you.

41:49.140 --> 41:51.259
You're a liar!

41:51.260 --> 41:55.419
You're a liar like the rest
of them. They're my family.

41:55.420 --> 41:58.980
Without them, I'm nothing.

41:59.020 --> 42:01.939
There are people
who care about you, Sophie.

42:01.940 --> 42:04.579
They don't know me.
You don't know me.

42:04.580 --> 42:07.340
I know what will happen
if you step forwards.

42:07.380 --> 42:08.980
It'll be a waste of a life.

42:10.260 --> 42:11.660
Sophie.

42:13.340 --> 42:15.140
I couldn't save your mother.

42:17.820 --> 42:21.420
I told her things would get better.
What kind of platitude is this?

42:24.860 --> 42:27.619
I don't know what kind of life
you can return to,

42:27.620 --> 42:31.579
but think what you leave
behind if you jump.

42:31.580 --> 42:34.860
Your father, your little daughter.

42:36.260 --> 42:41.060
Think what kind of life you're
making for them if you do this!

42:54.580 --> 42:57.180
Stop! Stop. Stop.

43:09.620 --> 43:10.980
Is it her?

43:19.620 --> 43:21.459
Yeah.

43:21.460 --> 43:24.620
Yeah. It's her, Sam.

43:30.580 --> 43:32.540
She's alive.

43:35.580 --> 43:37.340
I was wrong.

43:50.740 --> 43:52.780
Mum!

44:02.380 --> 44:04.420
I've got you.

44:08.300 --> 44:10.300
I've got you now.

44:18.100 --> 44:19.540
Stay!

44:19.580 --> 44:21.460
We have no time to lose, sir.

44:21.500 --> 44:23.419
Please.
You have lost a lot of blood.

44:23.420 --> 44:26.540
We really must get you
to a hospital right away. Alice!

44:55.780 --> 44:57.660
The body, in the shed.

44:59.140 --> 45:00.340
Whose was it?

45:03.020 --> 45:06.019
It wasn't Alice Webster.
It wasn't Sophie Giroux.

45:06.020 --> 45:08.380
That was a third girl,
wasn't it, Mr Gettrick?

45:10.260 --> 45:12.380
A girl by the name of Lena Garber?

45:14.380 --> 45:17.460
Jorn Lenhart figured out
you had taken Ms Garber, didn't he?

45:18.820 --> 45:20.820
And you killed him because of this.

45:25.700 --> 45:29.460
You've got a wife, haven't you?
Do you love her?

45:31.260 --> 45:34.340
You'd do anything for the ones
you love, wouldn't you?

45:36.020 --> 45:38.339
To protect them,
to keep them safe.

45:38.340 --> 45:41.739
Don't pretend what you had
with these poor girls

45:41.740 --> 45:43.740
was anything like love.

45:48.860 --> 45:50.260
Tell me about Lena Garber.

45:52.460 --> 45:54.300
Well, she was always difficult.

45:55.900 --> 46:00.300
I mean, Alice was difficult,
but she knew when to shut up.

46:00.340 --> 46:02.219
But Lena...

46:02.220 --> 46:06.660
She was like this
constant ringing in your ears.

46:08.740 --> 46:11.780
So... one night I shut her up.

46:15.460 --> 46:17.059
When?

46:17.060 --> 46:21.300
Just as Sophie got ill.
That's what gave me the idea.

46:24.380 --> 46:27.420
I put her body in the shed
the night I let Sophie out.

46:29.260 --> 46:33.940
Cos if they had a body, no-one
would come and look for her again.

46:35.540 --> 46:39.820
We could be a family.
Just a normal family.

46:41.540 --> 46:43.860
Adrian Stone
could mess with the DNA.

46:45.700 --> 46:48.739
Swap them out
so they looked like a match.

46:48.740 --> 46:51.580
You made Sophie pretend
she was Alice Webster,

46:51.620 --> 46:53.179
just to keep her close.

46:53.180 --> 46:56.139
The name Sophie Giroux was never
supposed to be mentioned,

46:56.140 --> 46:57.260
but she wasn't well.

46:58.500 --> 47:01.580
She told the paramedics
in the ambulance her real name.

47:03.980 --> 47:05.500
And Kristian Herz?

47:06.660 --> 47:08.660
I barely know the man.

47:10.060 --> 47:11.500
His wife, though...

47:14.900 --> 47:18.100
When I broke into their house
to get his camera...

47:18.140 --> 47:21.820
I was going to slit her ignorant
throat where she was sleeping.

47:23.500 --> 47:25.580
But then I thought...

47:25.620 --> 47:28.820
"After what you let me go through...

47:31.100 --> 47:33.620
"No, that is almost too good
for you."

47:37.100 --> 47:39.340
You put a great deal
of thought into this.

47:40.580 --> 47:43.540
It's like you said
the last time we met -

47:43.580 --> 47:45.220
I'm not a stupid man.

47:55.780 --> 47:58.500
How many other girls were there,
Mr Gettrick?

48:01.500 --> 48:04.300
What makes you think
there's any more?

48:05.820 --> 48:06.900
A feeling.

48:08.980 --> 48:12.220
A feeling I wish I didn't have.

48:25.660 --> 48:28.980
Dad, it's me, Eve.

48:33.860 --> 48:36.819
They're saying you're well enough.

48:36.820 --> 48:39.060
Well enough to go home.
They need the beds.

48:41.740 --> 48:44.940
But are you well, Dad? Are you?

48:46.260 --> 48:47.380
What...

48:49.140 --> 48:51.620
What do you want?

48:52.900 --> 48:56.700
I want you to tell me who you are.

48:56.740 --> 48:59.140
I want you to be honest with me.

49:01.180 --> 49:03.860
I want you to tell me...

49:03.900 --> 49:05.900
what it is you did.

49:07.740 --> 49:09.339
Darling?

49:09.340 --> 49:12.380
You said to remember you
for the good things.

49:12.420 --> 49:14.779
Why did you say that?

49:14.780 --> 49:17.140
Because you knew
it was going to come out?

49:21.260 --> 49:22.700
I'm sorry!

49:24.900 --> 49:26.380
I'm sorry...

49:29.500 --> 49:31.860
I don't know what I'm doing here.

49:33.340 --> 49:35.300
I don't know where I am.

49:56.666 --> 49:57.681
No.

50:00.586 --> 50:02.946
He's coming with me.

51:08.180 --> 51:10.580
IN FRENCH:

51:55.460 --> 51:57.500
MAN SPEAKS IN GERMAN

51:58.700 --> 52:00.700
IN FRENCH

53:10.420 --> 53:13.500
Hey... Lucy.

53:19.580 --> 53:22.020
I am your grand-papa.

53:30.140 --> 53:33.900
Do you... Do you like magic?

53:35.180 --> 53:36.660
Yeah?

53:43.740 --> 53:45.780
For you.

54:31.300 --> 54:35.739
He loved you so much, you know that?

54:35.740 --> 54:36.940
I know.

55:00.140 --> 55:02.500
She's doing really well. Alice.

55:04.820 --> 55:07.620
It amazes me how strong she is.

55:16.980 --> 55:19.380
You are keeping it, aren't you?

55:23.100 --> 55:24.499
Do you know...

55:24.500 --> 55:25.780
It's a girl.

55:30.620 --> 55:33.020
I can't wait to meet her.

55:58.820 --> 56:00.980
Everything will be fine.

56:01.020 --> 56:02.700
I know.

56:06.140 --> 56:08.020
HE SIGHS

56:10.780 --> 56:13.460
I'm sorry for what I've done.

56:15.700 --> 56:18.940
If there is a God, he knows
my heart. He knows how sorry I am.

56:20.380 --> 56:21.979
I have been a foolish old man,

56:21.980 --> 56:25.580
afraid to die just because
I still have so much to live for.

56:26.820 --> 56:29.620
IN FRENCH

56:38.820 --> 56:41.700
Now stop trying to buy
yourself more time.

56:41.740 --> 56:43.300
Let's get this over with.

57:10.220 --> 57:12.300
BEEPING

57:27.220 --> 57:28.620
Dix.

57:30.180 --> 57:31.460
Neuf.

57:33.260 --> 57:34.500
Huit.

57:35.740 --> 57:37.140
