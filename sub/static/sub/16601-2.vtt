Excuse me.

00:33.298 --> 00:35.948
Yeah?

00:38.087 --> 00:40.420
Com-Commissioner. Sir.

00:40.422 --> 00:43.824
Smoking and texting
on the job?

00:43.826 --> 00:45.692
What do you call that,
multitasking?

00:45.694 --> 00:48.628
(chuckling):
Uh, no, sir.

00:48.630 --> 00:50.764
I think you dropped something,
there.

00:50.766 --> 00:51.665
Sir?

00:51.667 --> 00:53.200
The butt.

00:53.202 --> 00:55.035
Oh, no, I was done with it.

00:57.706 --> 00:59.139
Name and shield?

00:59.141 --> 01:03.477
Officer Clark, sir. 62109.

01:03.479 --> 01:06.413
It's called littering,
Officer Clark.

01:06.415 --> 01:07.581
What, the butt?

01:07.583 --> 01:09.049
Please pick it up.

01:09.051 --> 01:10.083
Seriously?

01:10.085 --> 01:11.818
(sighs)

01:11.820 --> 01:13.286
Seriously.

01:13.288 --> 01:14.855
Pick it up.

01:14.857 --> 01:17.858
With all due respect, sir,
I-I work for the NYPD,

01:17.860 --> 01:18.892
not Sanitation.

01:18.894 --> 01:23.029
And that's called
refusing an order.

01:28.670 --> 01:33.206
Permission to secure said butt
upon my person, sir?

01:34.076 --> 01:35.709
Let me see your summons book.

01:35.711 --> 01:36.977
For what?

01:41.383 --> 01:43.683
How can we ask
to respect our laws

01:43.685 --> 01:46.319
if we don't respect them
ourselves?

01:48.323 --> 01:52.959
You wrote me a summons
for littering?

01:52.961 --> 01:55.428
While smoking on the job
and texting on your cell phone,

01:55.430 --> 01:57.497
both Patrol Guide violations.

01:57.499 --> 01:58.698
But I'm the good guy.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.600
I am one of your cops.

02:00.602 --> 02:02.402
Then act like it.

02:06.241 --> 02:08.407
(sighs)

02:13.715 --> 02:16.283
Anthony, put the groceries
over there.

02:16.285 --> 02:18.084
You got it, Ma.

02:18.086 --> 02:19.553
What do you want for lunch?

02:20.422 --> 02:22.222
Ma, we just ate lunch.

02:22.224 --> 02:24.257
I meant dinner.

02:24.259 --> 02:27.694
Ask your father
if he wants meatballs tonight.

02:27.696 --> 02:30.063
Pop isn't here anymore.
Remember?

02:31.033 --> 02:33.567
Will you stop fussing
with that mail

02:33.569 --> 02:36.369
and put the groceries away?

02:37.239 --> 02:38.271
Hello?

02:38.273 --> 02:39.840
I'm talking to you.

02:39.842 --> 02:41.441
Hang on.

02:41.443 --> 02:43.376
This can't be.
Y-Your bank statement.

02:43.378 --> 02:45.478
It says you have no money.

02:45.480 --> 02:46.947
What?

02:46.949 --> 02:50.383
Ma, two months ago, you--
you had $30,000.

02:50.385 --> 02:51.651
Now you got bupkis.

02:51.653 --> 02:53.854
What did I do?

02:53.856 --> 02:55.021
(sighs)

02:58.327 --> 02:59.593
Now you're mad.

02:59.595 --> 03:01.561
Ma, I'm not mad.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:01.563 --> 03:04.898
Y-You're mad. I can't take it
when you look at me like that.

03:04.900 --> 03:06.233
Come here.

03:06.235 --> 03:07.734
I promise you I'm not mad.

03:07.736 --> 03:08.768
I promise.

03:08.770 --> 03:10.704
Did I do something bad?

03:10.706 --> 03:12.539
It's gonna be okay.

03:15.110 --> 03:17.577
Everything's gonna be okay.

03:22.184 --> 03:23.283
Hey. What do we got?

03:23.285 --> 03:24.751
That's the million
dollar question.

03:24.753 --> 03:25.363
What do you mean?

03:25.364 --> 03:26.737
None of this makes any sense.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.222
Try me.

03:28.223 --> 03:30.790
This is Sally Jeffries.
She's lived here over 40 years.

03:30.792 --> 03:32.959
Neighbors describe her as
nothing short of a saint.

03:32.961 --> 03:35.061
Okay, so somebody shot
a churchgoing old lady.

03:35.063 --> 03:36.229
It wouldn't be the first time.

03:36.231 --> 03:38.031
She got any kids or grandkids

03:38.033 --> 03:39.399
involved in the gang culture
around here?

03:39.401 --> 03:40.400
She's got a son,

03:40.402 --> 03:41.401
but he's far from hood.

03:41.403 --> 03:42.736
He's an engineer
down in Virginia.

03:42.738 --> 03:45.238
Okay, well, somebody
kicked the door in.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.673
Maybe it was a robbery
or a home invasion?

03:46.675 --> 03:48.808
No, see here's where
it got strange.

03:48.810 --> 03:50.610
When our uniforms
responded to the scene,

03:50.612 --> 03:53.179
that front door was bolted
and chained from the inside.

03:53.181 --> 03:55.081
Okay, so our guys
kicked the door in.

03:55.083 --> 03:57.617
Well, maybe somebody was
sitting in here with her,

03:57.619 --> 03:59.719
shot her, and slipped out
one of the windows.

03:59.721 --> 04:01.955
Wh-- and bothered to put
the screen back?

04:01.957 --> 04:04.357
I mean, there's no gun anywhere,
so she obviously

04:04.359 --> 04:06.326
didn't shoot herself.
I don't know.

04:06.328 --> 04:08.061
I mean, don't laugh,

04:08.063 --> 04:10.630
but I'm a little spooked
by this whole thing.

04:10.632 --> 04:12.732
Well, what are gonna do,
call Ghostbusters?

04:12.734 --> 04:14.000
Let's just keep looking around.

04:14.002 --> 04:16.168
I'm sure there's
a logical explanation.

04:16.171 --> 04:19.172
Maybe someone shot her somewhere
and then dumped her here?

04:19.173 --> 04:21.908
Well, that theory
wouldn't really work,

04:21.910 --> 04:24.978
because you said the door was
locked from the inside, right?

04:24.980 --> 04:27.580
Well, then what?

04:27.582 --> 04:29.049
DANNY:
Maybe

04:29.051 --> 04:30.984
the round came from
outside of the apartment.

04:30.986 --> 04:32.152
That makes sense.

04:32.154 --> 04:33.320
Like a sniper?

04:33.322 --> 04:34.587
Or a stray bullet.

04:34.589 --> 04:37.123
There's no entry or exit wound
in the back of the sofa,

04:37.125 --> 04:39.826
so maybe it came in
from this direction.

04:43.532 --> 04:46.099
I'd say that looks
like a bullet hole to me.

04:46.101 --> 04:47.599
I don't believe it.
Yeah, believe it.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.380
You're gonna let this one
go to your head, aren't you?

04:49.404 --> 04:50.689
Most likely.

04:56.712 --> 05:01.014
Think I just found our ghost.
Someone's on the run.

05:02.884 --> 05:04.484
(tires screeching, horn blaring)
Hey!

05:04.486 --> 05:06.086
Hold it! Police!

05:06.955 --> 05:08.888
Stop!

05:08.890 --> 05:10.090
(panting)

05:13.195 --> 05:14.195
Police!

05:16.198 --> 05:17.030
Come back!

05:17.032 --> 05:18.231
Get out of the way, watch out!

05:18.233 --> 05:21.401
Come here.
Come here. Come here.

05:23.005 --> 05:25.638
(horn blaring)

05:27.075 --> 05:29.042
Move!
Whoa.

05:29.044 --> 05:30.310
Hey, man.

05:32.714 --> 05:35.148
Damn it.

This is you, right?

06:17.151 --> 06:18.784
Terrell Spaulding?

06:18.786 --> 06:20.419
Why'd you run?

06:20.421 --> 06:22.454
There some kind of law
against running?

06:22.456 --> 06:24.089
In my experience,

06:24.091 --> 06:26.058
when you run from cops,
it means you're guilty.

06:26.060 --> 06:30.395
In my experience, you don't run
from the cops, you're an idiot.

06:30.397 --> 06:32.598
You live six blocks from
Mrs. Jeffries' apartment.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.601
What were you doing clocking
what I was doing there?

06:35.603 --> 06:37.469
I don't know.
I was just looking.

06:37.471 --> 06:38.971
You was just looking?

06:38.973 --> 06:40.405
Do you know Ms. Jeffries?

06:40.407 --> 06:42.074
You know anything
about Ms. Jeffries?

06:42.076 --> 06:45.010
'Cause I do. She's
a mom and a wife

06:45.012 --> 06:47.646
and a grandmother,
and she raised a son

06:47.648 --> 06:50.082
from that block to graduate
from college with honors.

06:50.084 --> 06:53.452
Now, you and I both know that's
a very difficult thing to do.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.420
So give her a medal.

06:55.422 --> 06:56.722
(sighs)

06:56.724 --> 06:59.458
You know, I have a son your age.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.126
Give yourself a medal, too.

07:01.128 --> 07:03.929
And 14-year-old kids should
not be as hardened as you!

07:03.931 --> 07:06.198
You see a lot of white
picket fences up in my hood?

07:06.200 --> 07:08.233
No, I don't.

07:08.235 --> 07:11.170
When did you start running
with the Unique Splitz?

07:11.172 --> 07:13.438
Man, it's just ink.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.841
You think I was born
yesterday, Terrell?

07:15.843 --> 07:17.543
(sighs)
Come on.

07:17.545 --> 07:19.545
We both know that's
a gang affiliation.

07:19.547 --> 07:21.079
So why don't you
start talking?

07:21.081 --> 07:23.649
Okay. How's this?
I want a lawyer.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.217
You... you want a lawyer,
so maybe

07:25.219 --> 07:27.820
you're in a lot more trouble
than I thought you were, huh?

07:27.822 --> 07:29.054
I know the game.
Do you?

07:29.056 --> 07:30.756
I ask for a lawyer,
you ain't allowed

07:30.758 --> 07:32.090
to ask me no more questions.

07:32.092 --> 07:33.859
Where'd you pick that one up?
I told you.

07:33.861 --> 07:35.494
I ain't saying
nothing to you.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.996
Okay, then.

07:37.998 --> 07:41.500
You're free to go,
Street Smarts.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.202
Just remember,

07:43.204 --> 07:44.837
you've entered my world now.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.773
Nah, Detective.
You in <i> our</i> world.

07:47.775 --> 07:49.975
We'll see about that.

07:54.014 --> 07:56.215
Take him home.

07:57.351 --> 07:58.584
What do you got?

07:58.586 --> 08:00.219
We were canvassing the area
and talked to someone

08:00.221 --> 08:01.753
who might have seen something
on your case.

08:01.755 --> 08:03.589
Might have?

08:03.591 --> 08:04.857
He's not too chatty.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.459
It's going around. Thanks.

08:20.507 --> 08:22.708
Oh, my God.

08:23.577 --> 08:26.211
(laughs)

08:26.213 --> 08:27.379
(laughs)

08:27.381 --> 08:28.580
It's actually
pretty good.

08:28.582 --> 08:29.915
No.
(laughing)

08:29.917 --> 08:31.083
He can never see this.

08:31.085 --> 08:33.150
I have already
seen it.

08:33.153 --> 08:35.787
(laughter stops)

08:35.789 --> 08:39.091
Please join me.
You, too, Baker.

08:58.479 --> 09:00.812
Please... sit down.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.949
Just for the record,

09:03.951 --> 09:06.451
what idiot had the nerve
to send that to you?

09:06.453 --> 09:08.320
Idiots. Plural.
What?

09:08.322 --> 09:10.155
Both my sons.

09:12.126 --> 09:16.461
I thought Officer Clark's
caricature was pretty funny.

09:16.463 --> 09:17.796
Didn't you?

09:17.798 --> 09:20.732
Well, I don't know.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.302
Oh, come on.
You guys didn't even smile?

09:23.304 --> 09:25.504
I did.

09:26.540 --> 09:28.140
Maybe a little.

09:28.142 --> 09:30.776
It was more out of shock
than anything else.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.979
Nobody smiles in shock, Baker.

09:33.981 --> 09:36.448
Well, did you read
the comments?

09:36.450 --> 09:37.582
What comments?

09:37.584 --> 09:39.985
The responses to Officer Clark's
caricature.

09:39.987 --> 09:42.888
Uh, no, I did not.
Uh, give me the gist.

09:42.890 --> 09:46.124
There are a few positive
ones backing you up.

09:46.126 --> 09:47.259
Out of how many?

09:47.261 --> 09:51.063
A few out of hundreds
and counting.

09:51.065 --> 09:53.231
Plus, the <i> Post</i>
got a hold of it

09:53.233 --> 09:54.700
and put it on their Web site.

09:54.702 --> 09:56.635
Well, that's their job.

09:56.637 --> 09:57.869
There wasn't

09:57.871 --> 10:00.272
a version of this where you just
took down his name

10:00.274 --> 10:01.940
and passed it
to the commanding officer?

10:01.942 --> 10:04.042
Sure there was,
but that is not the version

10:04.044 --> 10:05.243
that actually happened.

10:05.245 --> 10:06.611
He smart-assed me,

10:06.613 --> 10:09.281
then he refused a direct order.

10:09.283 --> 10:11.516
You don't get to do that.

10:11.518 --> 10:14.019
Yes, sir. No, sir, I mean.

10:14.021 --> 10:16.555
And I did talk
to his commanding officer.

10:16.557 --> 10:17.789
Oh. Well, that's good.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.224
It is? Why's that?

10:19.226 --> 10:21.126
You know.
Kind of making it light.

10:21.128 --> 10:22.828
You know?
Things got a little heated,

10:22.830 --> 10:24.329
one thing led to another,

10:24.331 --> 10:25.530
yada, yada, yada...
Again,

10:25.532 --> 10:28.333
that is not the version
that actually happened.

10:28.335 --> 10:30.302
No?
I ordered his C.O.

10:30.304 --> 10:33.505
to place Officer Clark
on modified duty

10:33.507 --> 10:34.973
for insubordination.

10:34.975 --> 10:37.542
Just so you know, his dad's
Sergeant Pat Clark

10:37.544 --> 10:40.512
of the 3-1
and his uncle's deputy chief.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.681
No hooks on this, please.

10:43.951 --> 10:46.952
You know, in his day, Teddy was

10:46.954 --> 10:49.087
drawn as anything
from a bull moose

10:49.089 --> 10:52.290
to a fishwife
to a rogue elephant.

10:52.292 --> 10:56.328
I'd like to think he kept
his sense of humor, too.

11:03.737 --> 11:06.271
Does the name Frankie Reed
mean anything to you?

11:06.273 --> 11:08.273
Was he a friend
of your father's?

11:08.275 --> 11:11.343
No, Ma. He's a con man with
a rap sheet a mile long.

11:11.345 --> 11:14.413
Oh, I would never have anything
to do with someone like that.

11:14.415 --> 11:16.782
Uh, you-you wrote a half a dozen
checks for him

11:16.784 --> 11:19.184
for a few thousand
dollars apiece.

11:19.186 --> 11:21.186
I did?

11:21.188 --> 11:24.456
Oh! That's Frankie. I know him.

11:24.458 --> 11:25.857
He's not a con artist.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.359
He's a very nice man.

11:27.361 --> 11:28.860
You would like him, Anthony.

11:28.862 --> 11:31.396
Yeah, I really doubt that, Ma.
No, you would.

11:31.398 --> 11:33.698
Poor thing,
he just lost his wife.

11:33.700 --> 11:36.234
And his son has leukemia.

11:36.236 --> 11:38.370
I think it's leukemia.

11:38.372 --> 11:39.938
Is that why you gave him
the money, Ma?

11:39.940 --> 11:41.406
He told you his family was sick?

11:41.408 --> 11:43.775
Well... did I give him
a lot of money?

11:43.777 --> 11:45.610
You gave him all of it.

11:45.612 --> 11:47.379
Oh, Anthony.

11:47.381 --> 11:49.581
Please, don't tell me that.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.416
Listen to me very carefully.

11:51.418 --> 11:52.751
Mm-hmm.
I need you

11:52.753 --> 11:56.088
to try to remember everything
you can about this guy.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.456
What are you gonna do?

11:57.458 --> 11:59.391
Just take a look.

11:59.393 --> 12:00.592
Please.

12:05.833 --> 12:08.967
You told the officers you spoke
to that you saw one gang of kids

12:08.969 --> 12:10.135
fighting another gang of kids

12:10.137 --> 12:11.503
in front of Ms. Jeffries'
apartment,

12:11.505 --> 12:12.637
and then you heard a gunshot.

12:12.639 --> 12:14.606
Wait a second,
that's not exactly what I said.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.341
No? It's pretty damn close
to what you said.

12:16.343 --> 12:19.077
I-I would just... prefer to stay
out of this,

12:19.079 --> 12:20.078
if that's okay?

12:20.080 --> 12:21.847
Oh, now you want to stay
out of it?

12:23.617 --> 12:25.550
Oh, is that because you...
recently bought a place

12:25.552 --> 12:26.651
in that neighborhood yourself?

12:26.653 --> 12:28.787
Something wrong with that?
No. Not at all.

12:28.789 --> 12:31.022
I mean, I think it's great
when someone like you

12:31.024 --> 12:32.958
takes a chance on a neighborhood
like that.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.427
I mean, you're gonna fix your
place up all nice, and then

12:35.429 --> 12:37.462
other people will follow,
and then, hell,

12:37.464 --> 12:39.631
pretty soon there'll be
good schools

12:39.633 --> 12:41.533
and a Starbucks
on every street corner.

12:41.535 --> 12:43.301
That's the idea.
See the problem,

12:43.303 --> 12:45.437
though, Larry, is that
neighborhoods like that,

12:45.439 --> 12:46.872
they don't turn around
on their own.

12:46.874 --> 12:49.040
It takes members of the
community to do their part,

12:49.042 --> 12:51.209
and since you are now a member
of that community,

12:51.211 --> 12:52.644
how about you do your part?

12:52.646 --> 12:54.479
Detective, there is
no way I'm gonna

12:54.481 --> 12:55.914
get on the wrong side
of that gang.

12:55.916 --> 12:58.750
“That gang.”
You... mean the Splitz?

12:58.752 --> 13:00.585
Yeah.

13:00.587 --> 13:01.920
Well, is that because

13:01.922 --> 13:03.722
you're scared, Larry?

13:03.724 --> 13:05.657
Or is that because you know

13:05.659 --> 13:08.059
as soon as those kids finish
killing themselves off,

13:08.061 --> 13:10.095
then your property value
will increase?

13:10.097 --> 13:11.612
I'm not the one
who did anything wrong.

13:11.613 --> 13:14.299
Look, Larry,
someone fired a gun,

13:14.301 --> 13:16.768
and the bullet from that gun
killed an innocent woman

13:16.770 --> 13:19.738
sitting in her apartment,
on her sofa, watching TV.

13:19.740 --> 13:20.972
In your neighborhood.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.641
And that could be you next,
Larry.

13:22.643 --> 13:24.376
I know.
You <i> know.</i>

13:24.378 --> 13:26.478
Then work with me here.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.479
Who had the gun?

13:27.481 --> 13:28.613
(sighs)

13:28.615 --> 13:30.715
I'm not even positive
I heard a gunshot.

13:30.717 --> 13:32.417
I said maybe I did.

13:32.419 --> 13:33.518
You know, I think, maybe,

13:33.520 --> 13:35.687
you know exactly
who the shooter was.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.557
Look, I don't know why I'm
getting the third degree.

13:38.559 --> 13:40.992
I haven't done anything wrong.
I'm just trying to help.

13:40.994 --> 13:42.594
Then help.

13:42.596 --> 13:44.763
I can't.

13:44.765 --> 13:46.398
You can't or you won't?

13:51.872 --> 13:52.837
(grunts)
I'm not gonna

13:52.839 --> 13:54.372
ask you again.
Where's the money?

13:54.374 --> 13:55.974
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:55.976 --> 13:57.976
Hey, take it easy.
Mind your business.

13:57.978 --> 14:00.312
(grunts)
You like to fleece old ladies, do you?

14:00.314 --> 14:02.581
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Yeah, listen,

14:02.583 --> 14:04.449
you got two choices:
give me every nickel

14:04.451 --> 14:07.319
of my mother's money back, or I'm gonna
put your head through the wall.

14:07.321 --> 14:08.887
Okay, okay. I-I...
I'll give you the money.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.021
Just give me a couple of days.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.423
We ain't negotiating!
(grunts)

14:11.425 --> 14:12.424
I don't have it.

14:12.426 --> 14:13.291
Where is it?

14:13.293 --> 14:14.593
I spent it, all right?

14:14.595 --> 14:16.628
(groaning)
Police! Let him go!

14:16.630 --> 14:17.629
It's okay.

14:17.631 --> 14:18.597
I'm on the job.

14:18.599 --> 14:19.331
I said let him go.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.066
Now. Keep your hands

14:21.068 --> 14:22.234
where I can see 'em.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.536
JAMIE:
<i>I called you as a courtesy.</i>

14:24.538 --> 14:27.272
Your partner is this close
to getting himself arrested.

14:27.274 --> 14:29.674
I really appreciate it, Jamie.
You better talk to him, Erin.

14:29.676 --> 14:31.509
And you better have him
apologize to those officers.

14:31.511 --> 14:33.511
I will and he will.
But what happened?

14:33.513 --> 14:36.414
I mean, there's just no way
Anthony would act like this

14:36.416 --> 14:37.782
without just cause.

14:37.784 --> 14:40.151
He had 30,000 good reasons,
Erin, but that's no excuse.

14:40.153 --> 14:42.354
When a uniform tells you
to come, you come.

14:42.356 --> 14:43.421
What happened?

14:43.423 --> 14:45.724
See that one over there?

14:45.726 --> 14:47.192
That's Frankie Reed.

14:47.194 --> 14:49.160
He's a low-level scammer.
He befriended Anthony's mother

14:49.162 --> 14:51.630
a couple months ago,
who suffers from Alzheimer's.

14:51.632 --> 14:52.897
Looks like he conned her

14:52.921 --> 14:54.944
out of her whole life savings
over the last two months.

14:54.968 --> 14:56.735
So you arrested him?

14:56.737 --> 14:58.536
Unfortunately, I got nothing
to hold him on.

14:58.538 --> 15:00.572
You just said he conned her out
of $30,000.

15:00.574 --> 15:02.240
It's a he said, she said.

15:02.242 --> 15:04.175
And, unfortunately,
what she says today

15:04.177 --> 15:05.410
she can't remember tomorrow.

15:05.412 --> 15:06.811
So he just walks?

15:06.813 --> 15:08.780
Don't look at me. Your office
would kick this back to me

15:08.782 --> 15:10.315
before I could even get
the cuffs on.

15:10.317 --> 15:11.750
He says she gave him the money,

15:11.752 --> 15:13.218
and, for all we
know, she did.

15:13.220 --> 15:15.553
I got no case.
I got no probable cause here.

15:15.555 --> 15:18.089
It... (sighs)
You're right.

15:18.091 --> 15:20.659
It's okay. It's...

15:20.661 --> 15:23.962
You know, it's not okay.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.230
What? What's not okay?

15:25.232 --> 15:26.965
That we're constantly having
to tell people

15:26.967 --> 15:30.902
we can't help them
when it's our job to help.

15:30.904 --> 15:32.671
Erin...

15:32.673 --> 15:35.740
Let's go, Anthony. You need
to apologize to the officers.

15:35.742 --> 15:36.841
I do?
Yeah, you do.

15:36.843 --> 15:38.877
And then we're gonna figure out
a way

15:38.879 --> 15:40.712
to nail this son of a bitch
for what he did

15:40.714 --> 15:42.981
to your mother.

15:56.332 --> 15:57.932
What's up?
You holding?

15:57.934 --> 15:59.400
You got the green?

16:06.375 --> 16:08.909
(whooping)

16:15.618 --> 16:17.451
14 years old

16:17.453 --> 16:19.653
and knee-deep in the life,
huh, Street Smarts?

16:19.655 --> 16:22.423
You're really living the dream,
aren't you? Where's your mommy?

16:22.425 --> 16:24.258
You say something about my mother?
Take it easy.

16:24.260 --> 16:26.560
I'm looking for your boss, Roxy.
Where is she?

16:31.867 --> 16:34.101
Why don't you run
along and play?

16:35.237 --> 16:36.470
What you want?

16:36.472 --> 16:37.805
Roxy Barnes.

16:37.807 --> 16:40.507
Look at you, the
first woman to break

16:40.509 --> 16:42.409
the glass ceiling
and run the Splitz.

16:42.411 --> 16:43.844
Didn't just break it,
Five-O--

16:43.846 --> 16:45.679
straight-up blasted it.
That's impressive.

16:45.681 --> 16:47.448
You're a real inspiration
to women.

16:47.450 --> 16:49.750
You're a regular
Susan B. Anthony.

16:49.752 --> 16:50.451
Who?

16:50.453 --> 16:52.119
Never mind.

16:52.121 --> 16:53.387
My name's
Detective Reagan.

16:53.389 --> 16:55.189
I need to talk to you.
Nah.

16:55.191 --> 16:57.057
I don't do no talkin'.
You want to talk?

16:57.059 --> 16:59.893
Talk to the fat boy.
Here he comes.

16:59.895 --> 17:02.129
My name is Dominick Barbosa.

17:02.131 --> 17:03.297
(panting)

17:03.299 --> 17:05.598
I'm the registered counsel
for Ms. Barnes.

17:05.601 --> 17:07.233
The fat boy. Yeah, I get it.

17:07.236 --> 17:08.535
You're lawyered up already, huh?

17:08.537 --> 17:10.037
I'm a businesswoman.

17:10.039 --> 17:12.306
Fat boy always on retainer.

17:12.308 --> 17:13.546
Detective, how can we help you?

17:13.569 --> 17:14.075
We have reason to believe

17:14.076 --> 17:17.243
Sally Jeffries was shot by a
stray bullet through her window.

17:17.246 --> 17:18.479
We're talking to people
in the neighborhood,

17:18.481 --> 17:19.813
trying to get
information

17:19.815 --> 17:21.281
that might lead us
to her killer.

17:21.282 --> 17:23.183
It's a terrible thing
what happened there.

17:23.185 --> 17:24.952
Sad.
We were all very upset

17:24.954 --> 17:26.753
to learn that news this morning.
So then

17:26.756 --> 17:28.521
you wouldn't mind telling us
which member of your crew

17:28.523 --> 17:30.524
fired the gun, right?
My crew?

17:30.526 --> 17:32.593
Please, Five-O, you trippin'.

17:32.595 --> 17:34.895
Come on. I got an eyewitness,
saw your gang

17:34.897 --> 17:37.264
fighting in front of
Ms. Jeffries' window right

17:37.266 --> 17:38.298
at the time of the shooting.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.166
Who?

17:39.168 --> 17:40.467
Detective,
my client has

17:40.469 --> 17:41.902
no information to share.

17:41.904 --> 17:43.504
What happened
to everyone being so busted up

17:43.506 --> 17:44.938
about Ms. Jeffries' death?

17:44.940 --> 17:46.106
Man, check this out, man.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.876
We take care of our own
round these parts,

17:48.878 --> 17:50.044
and if we need
your help,

17:50.046 --> 17:51.712
we'll holla at you.
You know,

17:51.714 --> 17:53.614
for a little lady,
you sure got a big mouth.

17:53.616 --> 17:55.182
Damn straight.
Detective,

17:55.184 --> 17:57.084
if you have reason
to believe my client

17:57.086 --> 17:59.286
committed a crime,
then arrest her.

17:59.288 --> 18:00.788
Short of
that, have

18:00.790 --> 18:01.822
a pleasant afternoon.

18:01.824 --> 18:04.024
Stay close to her.

18:04.026 --> 18:05.392
She's gonna need you.

18:05.394 --> 18:07.728
Aw, get out of here, boy.
I'm going.

18:07.730 --> 18:09.863
But I'll see you soon.

18:09.865 --> 18:13.100
Man, kick rocks.
Just calm down.

18:15.604 --> 18:17.604
I want you to know
I really appreciate

18:17.606 --> 18:19.506
you doing this for me
and for my mother.

18:19.508 --> 18:22.242
Well, I haven't done anything yet.
But you're trying.

18:22.244 --> 18:24.545
There ain't that many triers
left in the world.

18:24.547 --> 18:27.114
Well, don't thank me until
we actually build a case.

18:27.116 --> 18:28.515
And how we gonna do that?

18:28.517 --> 18:31.185
Well, right now, Frankie says
your mother gave him the money,

18:31.187 --> 18:33.420
but you think he forced
her or threatened her.

18:33.422 --> 18:36.090
So if we can prove that,
then we have a case.

18:36.092 --> 18:38.225
Yeah. But Ma
don't remember nothing.

18:38.227 --> 18:39.827
Doesn't remember anything.

18:39.829 --> 18:40.894
Who doesn't remember anything?

18:40.896 --> 18:42.196
Your mother, Anthony.

18:42.198 --> 18:44.631
And that might be true,
but someone else might.

18:44.633 --> 18:47.534
She made nine transactions
in the period of two months,

18:47.536 --> 18:49.169
all at the same branch.

18:49.171 --> 18:53.874
So maybe someone saw this
scumbag being a real scumbag.

18:53.876 --> 18:55.843
Word choices, Anthony.

18:55.845 --> 18:57.211
What?

18:57.213 --> 18:59.379
Nothing.

19:01.250 --> 19:05.619
Do you have the cat
in your sight, ma'am?

19:05.621 --> 19:08.489
And is that tree visible
from the street?

19:08.491 --> 19:09.623
Ten-hut!

19:09.625 --> 19:11.892
As you were.

19:11.894 --> 19:14.528
Hey, Sam.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.396
How you doing?
Commissioner.

19:16.398 --> 19:18.899
Thought you might enjoy these.

19:18.901 --> 19:24.037
Officer Clark over there is part
of a long and rich tradition

19:24.039 --> 19:28.308
of using caricature to make
a political or social point.

19:28.310 --> 19:30.944
The difference
in this instance is

19:30.946 --> 19:35.182
that the guys who drew these
worked for the newspapers.

19:35.184 --> 19:37.417
He works for me.

19:46.462 --> 19:48.529
Here you go.

19:48.531 --> 19:51.131
I'm sorry about that,
Commissioner.

19:51.133 --> 19:53.167
Sorry you did it
or sorry I saw it?

19:53.169 --> 19:54.735
Both.

19:54.737 --> 19:56.703
Hmm.

19:56.705 --> 19:59.206
(sighs)
Look,

19:59.208 --> 20:02.543
you got family on the job,
but you didn't use a hook.

20:02.545 --> 20:04.077
How come?

20:04.079 --> 20:07.481
Sir, I've been made an
example of since I could walk.

20:07.483 --> 20:09.650
Something about me.
If I screw up, people in charge

20:09.652 --> 20:12.152
like to make an example of me.

20:12.154 --> 20:14.855
That's not what I'm doing here.

20:14.857 --> 20:16.790
Point is, I'm used to it.

20:16.792 --> 20:19.259
And I quit bothering
my family with it long ago.

20:22.431 --> 20:26.567
You put in for transfer
out to Nassau County.

20:26.569 --> 20:28.936
I don't think you have
all your Intel there, sir.

20:28.938 --> 20:31.038
No?

20:31.040 --> 20:32.940
I put in a year and a half ago.

20:32.942 --> 20:34.508
I got approved a year ago.

20:36.745 --> 20:39.346
But you're still here.

20:40.115 --> 20:43.183
I <i> was</i> still here, yes.

20:46.856 --> 20:48.822
(sighs)

20:48.824 --> 20:51.358
Copy that, Officer.

20:54.563 --> 20:56.797
I don't understand
why nobody here called me.

20:56.799 --> 20:58.232
Give me a heads-up
that my mother

20:58.234 --> 21:01.168
has taken out 30 grand
in less than two months.

21:01.170 --> 21:04.271
Mr. Abetemarco, your name
isn't on the account.

21:04.273 --> 21:07.641
Did anything look suspicious
to you or to any of the tellers?

21:07.643 --> 21:09.610
It's not our job to
be evaluating the company

21:09.612 --> 21:10.878
our clients keep.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.379
Well, it may not be your job,

21:12.381 --> 21:15.182
but it may be viewed
as your responsibility.

21:15.184 --> 21:18.685
Mrs. Abetemarco is the sole
signee on this account.

21:18.687 --> 21:22.556
She herself made
each of these withdrawals.

21:22.558 --> 21:25.225
I'm sorry, but that's all
I can say on the matter.

21:30.432 --> 21:32.900
Sounds like she played you
pretty good.

21:32.902 --> 21:33.800
Knew you were coming.

21:33.802 --> 21:35.402
Had her lawyer on standby.

21:35.404 --> 21:37.504
You want I should go back there
and get you her autograph?

21:37.506 --> 21:39.206
I'm just saying,
underestimate your enemy

21:39.208 --> 21:40.374
at your own peril.
(phone ringing)

21:40.376 --> 21:43.143
Underestimate your partner
at your own peril.

21:43.145 --> 21:45.078
Hey.

21:45.080 --> 21:47.681
Babe, can I call you back?
I'm just eating lunch here.

21:47.683 --> 21:50.083
(sighs)
Your son cut school today.

21:50.085 --> 21:51.285
He did what?

21:51.287 --> 21:52.486
Oh, and it gets better. Yeah.

21:52.488 --> 21:53.887
He and his knucklehead friends,

21:53.889 --> 21:56.123
they went to Cali's
and got drunk.

21:56.125 --> 21:57.824
Put him on the phone.
No.

21:57.826 --> 21:59.559
He's... (scoffs)
he's sleeping it off.

21:59.561 --> 22:00.560
Okay.

22:00.562 --> 22:02.462
I'll deal with him
when I get home.

22:03.766 --> 22:07.167
My idiot son skipped school
to go party with his friends.

22:07.169 --> 22:09.536
What, like you never cut school?

22:09.538 --> 22:11.071
Ah...

22:13.709 --> 22:16.843
I may have underestimated you,
partner.

22:16.845 --> 22:18.312
You're a genius.

22:19.148 --> 22:20.881
Okay.

22:20.883 --> 22:24.017
Can I have your fortune cookie?

22:30.993 --> 22:32.459
(siren chirps)

22:33.662 --> 22:35.529
(sirens blaring)

22:39.935 --> 22:42.169
(indistinct shouting)

22:43.772 --> 22:46.440
All right, hold him right there!
(shouting continues)

22:46.442 --> 22:47.274
Get 'em out of here!

22:47.276 --> 22:48.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:48.644 --> 22:49.710
Y'all can't
collar them!

22:49.712 --> 22:50.677
You got to observe them

22:50.679 --> 22:52.245
doing hand to hands first.

22:52.247 --> 22:53.580
Hey, they're not collaring
anyone.

22:53.582 --> 22:54.581
All right, so where the hell

22:54.583 --> 22:55.615
they taking my crew at, man?

22:55.617 --> 22:57.384
Well, these are
truancy officers.

22:57.386 --> 23:00.354
You do realize all of these kids
are supposed to be

23:00.356 --> 23:01.788
in class right now.

23:01.790 --> 23:03.290
Man, quit playing. Please.

23:03.292 --> 23:05.625
I'm actually not playing at all.

23:05.627 --> 23:07.060
In fact, I'm gonna be back here

23:07.062 --> 23:10.731
every morning at 7:30
when the school bell rings.

23:10.733 --> 23:12.866
Hey, you cannot do this, man.
And I sure the hell can do it.

23:12.868 --> 23:14.668
Or I can't.

23:14.670 --> 23:16.970
That is really up to you,
Half Pint.

23:16.972 --> 23:18.271
Half Pint?

23:18.273 --> 23:19.506
That's right, Short Stack.

23:19.508 --> 23:20.607
You want to tell me

23:20.609 --> 23:23.310
which one of your crew
was the shooter?

23:23.312 --> 23:25.679
I'll let them hang out of school
as long as they want.

23:25.681 --> 23:27.214
Man, hell no.

23:27.216 --> 23:29.316
Okay, then.
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:29.318 --> 23:31.418
And the next day.
And the next day!

23:31.420 --> 23:34.187
Man, you messing with
the wrong female, Five-O.

23:34.189 --> 23:35.889
Don't be a fool,
stay in school.

23:38.093 --> 23:40.160
Come on, get 'em out of here.
Let's go.

23:50.507 --> 23:51.572
(knocking)

23:51.575 --> 23:54.209
(sighs)

23:55.079 --> 23:56.679
Hey, Dad.

23:56.681 --> 23:57.676
“Hey, Dad”?

23:57.677 --> 23:58.843
Look, I'm sorry.

23:58.845 --> 24:00.444
No. You're gonna be sorry.

24:00.446 --> 24:03.080
Mom's making a much bigger deal
out of this than it is.

24:03.082 --> 24:04.148
You know how she gets.

24:04.150 --> 24:06.284
No, I don't know how she gets,
Jack.

24:06.286 --> 24:08.319
What I do know is you
and your friends cut school

24:08.321 --> 24:09.887
to go have a party
at Cali's house.

24:09.889 --> 24:11.289
It wasn't a party.

24:11.291 --> 24:13.124
So, now we're gonna add lying
on top of

24:13.126 --> 24:14.492
drinking and
cutting school.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.594
Wow, you're really
batting a thousand here, kid.

24:16.596 --> 24:18.095
I-I'm sorry.

24:18.097 --> 24:20.398
(sighs)

24:22.936 --> 24:24.035
Look.

24:24.037 --> 24:26.637
I know you think this isn't
a big deal,

24:26.639 --> 24:28.272
but it is.
Dad,

24:28.274 --> 24:29.373
it was just a couple of beers.

24:29.375 --> 24:30.541
The beers are bad enough.

24:30.543 --> 24:32.176
What's worse is you cut school.

24:32.178 --> 24:34.579
And what's even worse than that
is this.

24:34.581 --> 24:35.947
The party?

24:35.949 --> 24:37.081
No, not the party.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.083
The video you made of the party.

24:39.085 --> 24:40.418
(laughing, cheering)

24:43.089 --> 24:45.923
I-I... I just don't get
what the big deal is.

24:45.925 --> 24:47.458
You put it online!

24:47.460 --> 24:50.561
What if a college recruiter
saw this? Then what, Jack?

24:50.563 --> 24:51.963
Dad, it's ZipVid...

24:51.965 --> 24:54.265
It-it disappears unless
you put it on your timeline.

24:54.267 --> 24:56.233
And even then,
it's only up for 48 hours.

24:56.235 --> 24:58.169
Oh... so that means
the entire world

24:58.171 --> 25:01.105
only gets to see <i> my</i> son
act like a complete idiot

25:01.107 --> 25:03.207
for two whole days?
Well, that's a real relief.

25:03.209 --> 25:04.342
I'll delete it.

25:04.344 --> 25:06.410
You're not getting this back
till Christmas.

25:06.412 --> 25:09.680
That's <i> if</i> you
grow some brains by then.

25:09.682 --> 25:11.983
(sighs)

25:17.957 --> 25:19.423
(knocking)

25:19.425 --> 25:21.425
New plan.

25:21.427 --> 25:23.461
<i>“Buckner v.</i>
<i>The State of New York.”</i>

25:23.463 --> 25:25.429
What's it say?
Read it.

25:25.431 --> 25:26.864
Can't you just give me
the CliffsNotes?

25:26.866 --> 25:30.735
We don't need to prove that
Frankie coerced your mother.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.837
We just need to prove he was
aware of her condition

25:32.839 --> 25:34.405
at the time that he
asked for money.

25:34.407 --> 25:36.240
That's great.

25:36.242 --> 25:37.375
How we gonna do that?

25:37.377 --> 25:39.710
We get him to incriminate
himself on a wire.

25:39.712 --> 25:43.147
Erin, I know you mean good,
but...

25:43.149 --> 25:44.515
I can't wire up my mother.

25:44.517 --> 25:46.617
I'm not gonna put a wire
on your mother.

25:46.619 --> 25:49.086
Then who?
A cop.

25:49.088 --> 25:51.389
WAITRESS:
Your check, sir.

25:51.391 --> 25:53.157
But I haven't eaten yet.

25:53.159 --> 25:54.191
Um...

25:54.193 --> 25:55.993
Um...

25:55.995 --> 25:58.062
Oh... right.

25:58.064 --> 25:59.263
I'm sorry.

26:03.369 --> 26:04.535
Here, let me get that.

26:04.537 --> 26:05.636
It's the least I can do,

26:05.638 --> 26:06.771
since you were nice enough

26:06.773 --> 26:08.172
to listen to my sob story.

26:08.174 --> 26:09.473
No, it's okay.

26:09.475 --> 26:10.841
Nah, I insist.

26:10.843 --> 26:12.877
I mean, you don't know me.

26:12.879 --> 26:14.645
I'm just some stranger
who sat down

26:14.647 --> 26:15.846
next to you to shoot the breeze.

26:15.848 --> 26:17.048
I don't know you?

26:17.050 --> 26:19.183
You don't remember me
sitting down, do you?

26:19.185 --> 26:21.552
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

26:22.388 --> 26:24.188
You remember offering to
loan me money?

26:24.190 --> 26:26.057
No, did I?

26:26.059 --> 26:28.693
You did.

26:28.695 --> 26:31.562
You said my son's life
was worth a hell of a lot more

26:31.564 --> 26:33.864
than a measly $2,000.

26:33.866 --> 26:34.899
I did?

26:36.736 --> 26:38.269
You're having second thoughts.

26:38.271 --> 26:40.037
Henry, that's okay.
I don't want to hold you

26:40.039 --> 26:41.939
to a promise that
you don't want to keep.

26:41.941 --> 26:44.542
No, no, no.
I'm a man of my word.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.646
I want to give you the money.

26:48.648 --> 26:51.749
(voice breaking):
You're a saint, Henry.

26:51.751 --> 26:54.251
An honest-to-goodness saint.

26:54.253 --> 26:55.820
Should we...

26:55.822 --> 26:57.488
head over to the bank?

26:57.490 --> 26:59.924
Sure.

26:59.926 --> 27:01.826
We got him dead to rights.

27:01.828 --> 27:03.928
MAN:
Henry!

27:03.930 --> 27:05.429
Henry Reagan.

27:05.431 --> 27:06.497
Who?

27:06.499 --> 27:07.498
Henry, it's Chris Pappas.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.499
Don't you remember?

27:08.501 --> 27:10.634
We worked together
in the 3-1.

27:11.537 --> 27:12.603
You're a cop?

27:12.605 --> 27:14.572
I'm a little confused.

27:14.574 --> 27:16.741
Geez. Is this guy kidding me?

27:16.743 --> 27:17.775
PAPPAS:
A cop?

27:17.777 --> 27:20.444
This guy is NYPD royalty.

27:20.446 --> 27:21.645
Don't you know who he is?

27:21.647 --> 27:24.081
I think we should go to the bank
before it closes.

27:24.083 --> 27:25.449
Y-You know what?

27:25.451 --> 27:28.119
I just remembered
I have another appointment.

27:28.921 --> 27:30.454
Ah...

27:32.325 --> 27:35.126
Henry, did I just
screw something up?

27:36.696 --> 27:38.529
I'm sorry, Anthony.

27:38.531 --> 27:41.098
I can't believe this.
We had him.

27:41.100 --> 27:43.868
(groans)

27:43.870 --> 27:46.403
(sighs)
Seriously, what makes you think

27:46.405 --> 27:47.705
one of these kids shot video

27:47.707 --> 27:49.340
of the fight the other night?

27:49.342 --> 27:51.776
Because with kids nowadays,
an event didn't even occur

27:51.778 --> 27:53.677
unless somebody recorded it
on their phones.

27:53.679 --> 27:56.547
Well, I'll give you that,
but even if they did

27:56.549 --> 27:57.615
shoot the fight,
what makes you think

27:57.617 --> 27:58.582
they're dumb enough to share it

27:58.584 --> 28:00.050
on social media?
You'd be surprised

28:00.052 --> 28:03.254
how dumb a 14-year-old could be.
Trust me.

28:03.256 --> 28:05.389
Well, so far these kids seem...

28:05.391 --> 28:07.424
Well, wait a second.
What's that one?

28:07.426 --> 28:10.294
Looks like outside
Sally Jeffries' apartment.

28:10.296 --> 28:11.896
Play that video.

28:11.898 --> 28:14.465
(grunting, shouting)

28:15.635 --> 28:18.702
(gunshots)

28:22.775 --> 28:24.074
Would you look at that?

28:24.076 --> 28:27.511
Play it again, okay?
I'm gonna record it on my phone.

28:29.248 --> 28:33.117
It's gone.
I-I don't know what happened.

28:33.119 --> 28:36.353
These things, they self-destruct
after 48 hours.

28:36.355 --> 28:37.922
How do we get it back?

28:38.825 --> 28:41.091
Damn it.

28:45.264 --> 28:47.498
Knock. Pause
for response.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.532
Sorry, boss.

28:48.534 --> 28:49.934
But we think you should

28:49.936 --> 28:52.169
reinstate Officer Clark
to active duty.

28:52.171 --> 28:55.806
There is really nothing
to discuss here.

28:55.808 --> 28:58.042
Actually, I think there's
a lot to discuss.

28:58.044 --> 28:59.543
Particularly, your
over-the-top reaction

28:59.545 --> 29:00.911
to a minor infraction.

29:00.913 --> 29:03.380
Insubordination is never
a minor infraction.

29:03.382 --> 29:04.648
Walk into any precinct
