Thank you on behalf of our
amazing Samoan Fire Dancers

00:41.736 --> 00:43.603
and our Tahitian Hula Girls.

00:45.273 --> 00:46.656
Now it's finally time

00:46.741 --> 00:49.943
to unearth
the traditional kalua pig.

00:50.011 --> 00:52.078
This scrumptious
Hawaiian delicacy

00:52.129 --> 00:55.849
is seasoned and cooked
for 12 hours

00:55.916 --> 00:58.618
under layers of banana leaves
and hot stones.

00:58.669 --> 01:00.787
The result
is a wonderful flavor

01:00.855 --> 01:02.722
that can't be duplicated

01:02.790 --> 01:05.925
except by this ancient
Hawaiian technique.

01:05.993 --> 01:07.093
Get your cameras ready!

01:07.161 --> 01:08.695
On the count of three:

01:08.763 --> 01:11.164
One... two... thr...

01:13.334 --> 01:15.602
What's that?
What is that?

01:17.204 --> 01:18.672
What is that?

01:25.613 --> 01:29.613

01:54.699 --> 01:56.613
Okay, monkey,
I want you

01:56.614 --> 01:59.448
to wipe that sad face off;
we're gonna find her, I promise.

01:59.500 --> 02:00.950
You have my word, okay?

02:01.001 --> 02:02.785
Don't worry about it.

02:03.754 --> 02:05.221
I'm sorry I lost her.

02:05.289 --> 02:07.123
What are you talking about?

02:07.174 --> 02:08.358
You didn't lose her.

02:08.425 --> 02:10.259
Let me explain something
to you what happened.

02:10.327 --> 02:11.594
Dolphin trainer Annie,

02:11.645 --> 02:14.097
she just got out of bed
in the middle of the night

02:14.148 --> 02:15.098
because she was thirsty.

02:15.166 --> 02:16.466
She went to get
a glass of water.

02:16.534 --> 02:18.468
But the problem is,
she couldn't find

02:18.536 --> 02:19.636
her way back to bed.

02:19.703 --> 02:21.321
I'm starting to think
she does that

02:21.405 --> 02:22.972
every time she's here,
but that is fine

02:23.040 --> 02:25.308
because good news for you
and good news for her

02:25.359 --> 02:27.310
is that I'm a detective,
a very good detective.

02:27.361 --> 02:29.195
So, don't worry,
we're in good hands.

02:30.647 --> 02:33.583
That your mom?
Mm-hmm.

02:33.651 --> 02:35.652
Well, would you tell her
we got an emergency, okay?

02:35.719 --> 02:36.653
Hold on.

02:38.622 --> 02:41.357
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

02:44.528 --> 02:45.795
Ma'am...

02:45.846 --> 02:47.697
is this your
missing person?

02:47.765 --> 02:48.865
Mm-hmm.

02:48.933 --> 02:50.400
Yeah? Give me
a smile.

02:50.467 --> 02:52.135
Okay, here you go.

02:52.186 --> 02:53.502
Come on.

02:53.554 --> 02:54.938
Let's go.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.444
Excuse me.

03:01.511 --> 03:03.446
Can I have my hug, please?

03:03.514 --> 03:05.715
Come here.

03:05.783 --> 03:07.250
Thank you.

03:07.318 --> 03:11.087
Hey, I want you to remember
something, okay? Always.

03:11.155 --> 03:12.422
Danno loves you.

03:12.489 --> 03:13.923
I love you, too.

03:13.991 --> 03:15.375
Give me a kiss.

03:16.377 --> 03:17.377
All right.

03:35.012 --> 03:37.413
Can't be a dolphin trainer
without the dolphin.

03:40.434 --> 03:42.018
Monkey!

03:42.069 --> 03:43.653
Hey!

03:44.688 --> 03:46.356
Hey. Amy.

03:46.407 --> 03:47.857
Danny, I had
to see you.

03:47.908 --> 03:48.858
What's the matter?

03:48.909 --> 03:51.928
It's Meka.

03:55.899 --> 03:58.234
He's dead, Danny.

04:03.674 --> 04:07.677
So, yesterday, uh, I heard
that it was a cop, but...

04:07.745 --> 04:09.379
ah, geez, I had
no idea.

04:09.446 --> 04:12.432
You couldn't have known.

04:14.218 --> 04:16.152
They needed the dental records

04:16.220 --> 04:18.421
to identify his body.

04:18.488 --> 04:19.856
Where's Billy?

04:19.923 --> 04:22.158
With his grandparents.

04:22.226 --> 04:24.694
He's so confused, Danny.

04:24.762 --> 04:27.730
He knows
his father is gone,

04:27.798 --> 04:30.867
but beyond that,
I don't know what to tell him.

04:32.269 --> 04:36.272
You know, Amy, anything
you need, I'm here for you.

04:36.340 --> 04:37.440
You know that.

04:37.508 --> 04:38.607
Meka always said

04:38.659 --> 04:40.609
you're the best partner
he ever had.

04:40.661 --> 04:43.813
Yeah, for a <i>haole</i> anyway.

04:44.832 --> 04:46.616
It wasn't like that.

04:46.684 --> 04:49.319
He liked working with you
because you had fresh eyes,

04:49.386 --> 04:52.088
good instincts,
and he said

04:52.156 --> 04:54.390
you were always
direct with him.

04:54.458 --> 04:57.460
He trusted you with his life.

04:58.795 --> 05:00.330
What about the investigation?

05:00.397 --> 05:01.597
Does HPD have any suspects?

05:01.665 --> 05:03.499
No, I wouldn't know.

05:03.567 --> 05:05.969
Um, HPD's kept their distance.

05:07.784 --> 05:10.363
Even the people
I thought were Meka's friends.

05:11.492 --> 05:12.775
What do you mean?

05:12.843 --> 05:15.111
That's why I'm here.

05:16.138 --> 05:18.634
Um... they're not
telling me anything.

05:18.635 --> 05:20.158
Wait, Amy, that doesn't
make any sense.

05:20.159 --> 05:21.759
None of this does.

05:21.827 --> 05:23.261
When I called to ask about
the funeral arrangements,

05:23.329 --> 05:25.063
they told me
they're still pending.

05:25.130 --> 05:26.430
They're pending?
They're pending what?

05:26.482 --> 05:28.432
I don't know.

05:28.484 --> 05:31.035
Every time I call to follow up,
they give me the runaround.

05:31.103 --> 05:33.371
It's like
something's going on.

05:33.438 --> 05:35.439
Something they're
not telling me.

05:38.043 --> 05:44.849
My husband sacrificed his life
for the job, and...

05:44.917 --> 05:48.853
the way he died, I...

05:52.625 --> 05:55.226
I just... I need to know

05:55.293 --> 05:57.729
that there's someone out there
looking for the people

05:57.796 --> 05:59.230
who did that to him.

05:59.298 --> 06:00.298
Okay, listen...

06:00.366 --> 06:01.566
there is now.

06:20.092 --> 06:22.343
Official C.O.D is two shots
to the chest.

06:22.411 --> 06:23.511
Close contact.

06:23.562 --> 06:25.230
Everything else
was postmortem.

06:26.315 --> 06:27.682
All right, close contact.

06:27.733 --> 06:29.017
Might have been someone he knew.

06:29.085 --> 06:30.985
- What about the slugs?
- .45s.

06:31.053 --> 06:33.054
Ballistics has them.
No hits yet.

06:33.105 --> 06:34.606
I checked with the
luau organizers.

06:34.690 --> 06:37.158
The imu pit was dug
and prepped the night before,

06:37.226 --> 06:38.493
and the M.E.'s guess was,

06:38.561 --> 06:40.394
the body was put there
between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m.

06:40.446 --> 06:41.446
So no witnesses.

06:41.530 --> 06:42.447
Somebody actually

06:42.531 --> 06:43.698
had to dig up a pig

06:43.766 --> 06:45.300
and replace it with Meka's body.

06:45.367 --> 06:46.735
Nobody's saw
anything?

06:46.802 --> 06:48.503
I find that
very hard to believe.

06:48.571 --> 06:50.538
I'll tell you,
killing a cop like that,

06:50.606 --> 06:53.007
putting his badge in his mouth?
That's no average street crime.

06:53.075 --> 06:54.909
- That's someone sending a message.
- Yeah? All right, well,

06:54.977 --> 06:56.177
I want to know who sent it.

06:56.245 --> 06:57.846
It could be related to something
Meka was working on.

06:57.913 --> 07:00.849
All right, Chin, you and Kono
go to Meka's house,

07:00.916 --> 07:02.350
talk to his wife.
Her name's Amy.

07:02.417 --> 07:03.918
Uh, her son's name is Billy.

07:03.969 --> 07:06.354
Good. Okay. See if Meka left
any of his casework at the house.

07:06.422 --> 07:08.069
Danny and I will go
follow up with HPD.

07:08.070 --> 07:09.603
All right, who's the
lead detective on the case?

07:09.628 --> 07:10.828
A sergeant name of Cage.

07:11.426 --> 07:13.394
- Cage?
- Yeah.

07:13.462 --> 07:14.696
You sure?

07:15.631 --> 07:16.898
Why? You know him?

07:16.966 --> 07:19.200
Yeah. But Cage isn't Homicide.

07:19.268 --> 07:20.769
He's a headhunter.

07:20.870 --> 07:22.804
Internal Affairs.

07:26.108 --> 07:29.210
Cage, you are
a prince.

07:29.278 --> 07:31.212
A cop gets murdered
and burned in a pit,

07:31.280 --> 07:32.914
and you are out here
practicing your swing.

07:32.965 --> 07:36.851
How I choose to spend my
lunch hour is my business.

07:36.919 --> 07:39.337
Some people relieve stress
by lifting weights, others run.

07:39.421 --> 07:41.256
I hit tiny
little white balls

07:41.323 --> 07:44.225
a very long way.

07:44.293 --> 07:46.794
Why is Internal Affairs
running a homicide investigation?

07:46.846 --> 07:50.482
More importantly, where do you
get the stones big enough

07:50.566 --> 07:52.466
to mess with a fallen officer's
memorial service?

07:52.518 --> 07:53.468
Can you tell me that?

07:53.536 --> 07:55.904
Look, Detective Williams,

07:55.971 --> 07:57.405
I understand
where you're coming from.

07:57.472 --> 07:58.490
You knew the victim.

07:58.574 --> 07:59.941
Rest assured,
we're investigating

08:00.025 --> 08:01.943
Detective Hanamoa's murder
to the best of our ability.

08:01.994 --> 08:04.312
Good, good. So you got
witnesses, suspects, leads?

08:04.363 --> 08:05.747
I'm not at liberty to say.

08:05.814 --> 08:07.215
Look, Sergeant, the governor's

08:07.283 --> 08:08.430
given us full authority
and jurisdiction. Okay?

08:08.455 --> 08:09.476
So whatever you do have...

08:09.477 --> 08:11.429
I know all about you Five-O
task force,

08:11.453 --> 08:14.889
and that you forced
yourself onto this case.

08:14.957 --> 08:16.674
But this is
an Internal Affairs matter

08:16.759 --> 08:18.226
involving an officer
suspected of corruption.

08:18.294 --> 08:19.544
We will handle
this in-house.

08:19.628 --> 08:20.895
What did you say,
corruption?

08:20.963 --> 08:22.397
What the hell's the matter

08:22.464 --> 08:24.232
with you, corruption, huh?
Danny, Danny.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.967
You got evidence
to back that up?

08:26.035 --> 08:27.719
Off the record?

08:27.803 --> 08:29.070
Yeah. Sure. Off the record.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.006
Last few months,

08:33.075 --> 08:35.275
an alarming number
of Detective Hanamoa's cases

08:35.344 --> 08:37.278
seemed to fall apart
at the eleventh hour.

08:37.346 --> 08:39.147
I'm talking
raids getting blown,

08:39.215 --> 08:41.866
leads drying up,
busts coming up empty.

08:41.951 --> 08:43.150
Stop.

08:43.219 --> 08:44.319
Stop.

08:44.386 --> 08:45.686
I knew this guy. All right?

08:45.738 --> 08:47.021
He was a good cop.

08:47.089 --> 08:49.958
He was a clean cop.

08:50.025 --> 08:51.426
Believe what you want.

08:51.493 --> 08:52.710
I said too much already.

08:52.795 --> 08:54.028
All right, we want
to see the case files.

08:54.079 --> 08:55.196
They're sealed
by court order.

08:55.264 --> 08:57.582
Okay, all right,
then give us a name.

08:57.666 --> 08:59.367
All right,
a number.

08:59.418 --> 09:00.534
I'll settle
for a haiku.

09:00.586 --> 09:01.702
Just point us
in a direction.

09:01.754 --> 09:02.837
Good day, gentlemen.

09:02.905 --> 09:04.005
Okay, you know what?

09:04.073 --> 09:06.741
This is why everybody
hates Internal Affairs,

09:06.809 --> 09:08.142
because you are useless.

09:10.112 --> 09:12.146
Not even worth it.

09:12.214 --> 09:14.215
I'm gonna go talk
to some real cops.

09:14.283 --> 09:15.549
Detective Williams,
I'm warning you.

09:15.601 --> 09:16.550
Let us handle this.

09:16.602 --> 09:17.551
You know what?

09:17.603 --> 09:19.053
Meka was his friend.

09:19.121 --> 09:20.438
Then he should
recuse himself.

09:20.522 --> 09:23.358
When you know the victim,
it clouds your judgment.

09:23.409 --> 09:25.393
Spare your friend some pain.

09:25.444 --> 09:27.295
The more he learns, the
worse he's gonna feel.

09:27.363 --> 09:29.030
Trust me.

09:35.904 --> 09:38.072
I'm so grateful Danny sent help.

09:40.242 --> 09:42.010
What kind of things

09:42.077 --> 09:43.344
are you looking for?

09:43.412 --> 09:45.713
His cell phone or a laptop--
anything that your husband

09:45.781 --> 09:47.048
might have used
for work.

09:47.099 --> 09:48.483
He had his cell phone on him.

09:48.550 --> 09:51.085
That's okay. We can run
his records without it.

09:51.136 --> 09:53.655
What about a computer?

09:53.722 --> 09:55.356
Meka's laptop's in the den.

09:55.424 --> 09:57.141
He was on it
all the time for work.

09:57.226 --> 09:58.326
Do you mind?

09:58.394 --> 10:00.395
No, no. Go ahead, please.

10:04.566 --> 10:07.535
I know this is hard,
but did Meka have any enemies?

10:07.603 --> 10:09.938
Get any threats
of any kind?

10:10.005 --> 10:11.940
Not that I know of.

10:12.007 --> 10:13.875
Uh, he'd been pretty quiet

10:13.943 --> 10:15.176
the last month.

10:15.244 --> 10:18.579
Like he gets when he
locks onto a case.

10:18.631 --> 10:21.849
But now knowing
about this I.A. thing,

10:21.917 --> 10:25.386
I guess he was probably
stressed,

10:25.454 --> 10:27.388
he didn't want
to tell us.

10:27.456 --> 10:30.158
Just because I.A.
accused Meka of something

10:30.225 --> 10:31.592
doesn't make it true.

10:34.630 --> 10:36.631
Have you dealt
with them before?

10:38.467 --> 10:41.669
Unfortunately, yeah.

10:49.328 --> 10:51.346
Is this Meka's desk?

10:53.182 --> 10:55.416
Yeah.

10:55.484 --> 10:56.751
Hey, Ahuna,

10:56.819 --> 10:58.686
what happened to
all of Meka's stuff?

11:08.897 --> 11:10.198

11:14.236 --> 11:16.504

11:16.555 --> 11:18.639

what Meka was working on?

11:18.707 --> 11:20.842
Nope.

11:20.909 --> 11:22.844
You?

11:22.911 --> 11:24.212

11:26.081 --> 11:27.899
Nobody?

11:27.983 --> 11:31.152
What was Meka working on? Huh?

11:32.321 --> 11:34.255
12 years the guy wears a badge,

11:34.323 --> 11:35.990
and you're all looking at me
like you don't know who he is?

11:40.162 --> 11:42.563
I need somebody
to help me out here.

11:43.932 --> 11:46.200
- Kaleo, right?
- Yeah.

11:46.268 --> 11:48.052
You work with Meka before?

11:48.170 --> 11:49.504
I'm in the middle
of something here.

11:49.555 --> 11:50.505
Yeah, I know,
you're in the middle

11:50.572 --> 11:51.806
of not answering my question.

11:51.874 --> 11:56.210
You got issues, <i>haole,</i>
take it up with I.A.,

11:56.278 --> 11:58.112
'cause we got a gag order here,

11:58.180 --> 12:00.882
and around here,
we follow orders.

12:00.949 --> 12:02.216
Understand?

12:05.220 --> 12:08.556
Yeah. I understand.

12:12.394 --> 12:14.195
Chin, what do you got?

12:14.246 --> 12:15.913
Just ran Meka's
cell phone records.

12:15.998 --> 12:17.198
Found something odd.

12:17.249 --> 12:19.534
On the night before he died,
he booked a flight out.

12:19.585 --> 12:21.235
Where to?

12:21.303 --> 12:23.037
Singapore.
He was flying there next week.

12:23.105 --> 12:24.905
All right, uh...
talk to Amy,

12:24.957 --> 12:27.008
see if maybe they were
going on a family vacation.

12:27.076 --> 12:28.909
I already did.
He only bought one ticket.

12:28.961 --> 12:30.294
Amy had no idea.

12:30.379 --> 12:33.581
All right, see if you can
recover his e-mails, all right.

12:33.632 --> 12:35.516
See who he was
going to see there,

12:35.584 --> 12:36.851
where he was staying, anything.
Please.

12:36.919 --> 12:38.019
Got it.

12:40.139 --> 12:41.856
What? What do you think?

12:41.923 --> 12:44.091
I'm...

12:44.143 --> 12:46.093
Guy books a flight
out of the country

12:46.145 --> 12:47.428
the night before he's murdered.

12:47.479 --> 12:49.063
It just-it just
makes me wonder.

12:49.131 --> 12:50.064
Makes you wonder what?

12:50.115 --> 12:51.866
That he knew it was coming.

12:51.934 --> 12:54.068
Okay, can you please
just do me a favor?

12:54.119 --> 12:56.404
- Don't go there.
- Come on, Danny, just level with me here.

12:56.455 --> 12:57.771
You didn't think
of that for a second?

12:57.823 --> 12:59.273
No, I didn't think of that
for a second, all right?

12:59.324 --> 13:00.541
You want something
to think about,

13:00.609 --> 13:02.176
think about Kaleo, getting
some answers from him,

13:02.244 --> 13:04.045
'cause all these questions
are giving me a migraine.

13:04.112 --> 13:06.414
Take it easy.
Okay. I'm easy.

13:06.498 --> 13:08.616
Singapore?

13:08.667 --> 13:11.052
No, never heard Meka
mention it. Why?

13:11.120 --> 13:12.953
Because we thought it
might have something

13:13.005 --> 13:14.455
to do with an active case.

13:14.506 --> 13:16.374
Honestly, I don't know
anything about it.

13:16.441 --> 13:18.926
I just know that no one
deserves to go out like that.

13:20.462 --> 13:22.396
You hear why
Internal Affairs is after him?

13:22.464 --> 13:25.399
People talk. Who knows?

13:25.467 --> 13:27.635
Some guys like Ahuna
think he was on the take.

13:27.686 --> 13:30.238
Others say he got too close,
and it got him killed.

13:30.305 --> 13:31.472
Too close to what?

13:31.523 --> 13:34.075
You ever hear
of the Ochoa Cartel?

13:34.143 --> 13:35.943
Yeah, the new up-and-comers
in the coke trade.

13:36.011 --> 13:37.712
They turned the Texas border
into a war zone.

13:37.779 --> 13:39.413
Why? What, you think
Ochoa's people are here?

13:39.481 --> 13:43.117
All I know for sure, when
Ochoas move in on new territory,

13:43.185 --> 13:44.919
they don't just hit people.

13:44.987 --> 13:46.420
They like to send a message.

13:46.488 --> 13:48.022
Like roasting a pig at a luau?

13:59.472 --> 14:01.394
Tell you what, if this
Ochoa thing is for real,

14:01.395 --> 14:02.629
it makes complete sense why Cage

14:02.698 --> 14:04.065
is putting this whole thing
on lockdown.

14:04.132 --> 14:05.816
I mean, a high-profile
case like this

14:05.901 --> 14:06.817
could boost his career...

14:06.902 --> 14:08.536
What? What's with the face?

14:08.603 --> 14:09.904
I don't have a face.

14:09.971 --> 14:11.372
Yes, you do.
You have a face, okay?

14:11.439 --> 14:13.741
I am a detective, it's
what I do, I read people,

14:13.792 --> 14:15.376
All right. and you, my friend,
have a face.

14:15.443 --> 14:16.711
All right.
I want to ask you something,

14:16.778 --> 14:18.179
but I know it's going
to piss you off.

14:18.246 --> 14:19.547
Would you not always be
so judgmental with me?

14:19.614 --> 14:21.582
I'm not judgmental.
Treat me like I'm some hothead

14:21.650 --> 14:22.633
who can't think objectively.

14:22.718 --> 14:23.718
I can think objectively.

14:23.802 --> 14:26.453
Really?
Yes, really! Ask away!

14:26.505 --> 14:27.538
Okay.

14:27.606 --> 14:29.757
Did you and Meka ever have
any issues?

14:29.825 --> 14:31.659
Any issues...?

14:31.727 --> 14:33.094
No, no issues, Oprah.

14:33.161 --> 14:34.428
It's just, Cage said something
that's really...

14:34.496 --> 14:35.429
it's been bugging me.

14:35.497 --> 14:37.431
Something about a leak
in the department.

14:37.482 --> 14:39.066
Okay. He never said that,
first of all.

14:39.134 --> 14:40.468
Second of all,
Cage couldn't find a leak

14:40.535 --> 14:41.819
if someone was taking one
on his head!

14:41.903 --> 14:43.437
Okay, maybe, whatever.

14:43.505 --> 14:45.773
But remember Sang Min, the human
trafficker than we took down?

14:45.824 --> 14:47.024
No, it doesn't ring a bell.

14:47.109 --> 14:49.443
Yeah, I remember him.
Almost got Kono killed

14:49.494 --> 14:51.112
when she went undercover.
Thank you. Okay.

14:51.163 --> 14:52.813
Sang Min took a photo of Kono.

14:52.864 --> 14:56.450
He sent it to somebody in HPD
who I.D.'d her as a cop.

14:56.518 --> 14:57.952
Okay, so what are you implying?

14:58.003 --> 14:59.153
I'm not implying anything.

14:59.204 --> 15:00.621
I'm asking for your
objective opinion,

15:00.672 --> 15:04.091
as a detective,
is it possible that person

15:04.159 --> 15:05.092
could've been Meka?

15:05.160 --> 15:06.293
No.
It's not possible?

15:06.361 --> 15:08.095
- Not possible. I just said...
- Zero chance.

15:08.163 --> 15:10.464
What are you doing? What,
are you taking Cage's side?

15:10.515 --> 15:11.999
I'm not taking Cage's side,
Danny, I'm just saying,

15:12.050 --> 15:13.768
maybe it's worth a trip
to Halawa Correctional

15:13.835 --> 15:15.302
to get Sang Min to tell us

15:15.353 --> 15:17.388
who his inside man was.
Sang Min should've told us

15:17.472 --> 15:18.539
where Hoffa was!

15:18.607 --> 15:19.774
We grilled the guy

15:19.841 --> 15:21.642
for 72 hours!
We offered him plea bargains!

15:21.693 --> 15:23.978
Now he's doing life, he's
gonna answer the same question?

15:24.045 --> 15:25.863
What are we gonna do,
say "pretty please"?

15:25.947 --> 15:27.414
Well, you don't think
it's worth a trip to find out?

15:27.482 --> 15:30.017
Our job is to go after
the suspect,

15:30.085 --> 15:31.185
not the victim!

15:31.236 --> 15:32.753
Not the previously
convicted,

15:32.821 --> 15:34.038
the suspect, Ochoa!

15:34.122 --> 15:36.323

and he's dangerous!

That's what I'm gonna
focus on, okay?

15:39.211 --> 15:41.095

15:41.163 --> 15:43.564
I would hate to work

15:45.901 --> 15:47.868
Your detective friend Kaleo
wasn't kidding--

15:47.936 --> 15:50.838
the Ochoa Cartel
doesn't fool around.

15:50.889 --> 15:53.007

15:53.074 --> 15:55.676

courthouse in Juarez.

15:55.744 --> 15:58.012
This is a cop
burned in a roll

15:58.079 --> 16:00.314
of rubber tires
in Oaxaca.

16:00.381 --> 16:03.050

the first to be found

16:03.118 --> 16:05.102
with their badges
in their mouths.

16:05.187 --> 16:07.188
Just like Meka.

16:07.239 --> 16:09.731
Kono, did you get anything off
Meka's laptop from the house?

16:09.732 --> 16:11.246
No, the hard drive
was wiped clean.

16:11.247 --> 16:12.967

top lieutenants,

16:15.650 --> 16:16.816
a guy by the name of

16:16.867 --> 16:19.619
Emilio Ochoa, is the one
responsible for the hits.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.288
- So if he's here...
- I want him.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.589
The question is,
how do we get to him.

16:22.657 --> 16:24.257
Through his product--
we find Ochoa's

16:24.325 --> 16:26.493

that's how we get to him.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.695

20:19.994 --> 20:21.194
Okay, get out.
Get out, get out,

20:21.261 --> 20:23.095
get out, get out.
Out, out, out.

20:23.147 --> 20:25.315
Hey, gentlemen.
Shall we have a little chat?

20:25.399 --> 20:28.167
Yes. We, uh,
we'd love that.

20:28.235 --> 20:30.403
But maybe in private
would be better.

20:30.454 --> 20:32.939
Get out!
Get out of here!

20:32.990 --> 20:34.324
Buh-bye. Okay,
so now we're having fun.

20:34.408 --> 20:35.909
We're just having a good
old time, and I don't know

20:35.976 --> 20:38.211
who you are, because I've never
seen you before in my life.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.612
Oh, we, uh, we just...

20:39.663 --> 20:41.497
- we just came in from out of town.
- Okay.

20:41.582 --> 20:43.333
And would this be
the first piece

20:43.417 --> 20:45.418
you are purchasing from us?
Uh, yeah, here.

20:45.469 --> 20:48.354
Uh, and by "piece,"
uh, you mean a key, right?

20:48.422 --> 20:50.673
I mean, for those of us
not into art.

20:52.843 --> 20:54.060
I don't have any idea

20:54.127 --> 20:55.728
what you're talking about,
um, at all.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.129
But in case
you want to buy

20:57.181 --> 20:59.682
a piece, it's very simple--
here's how it works.

20:59.767 --> 21:01.634
Uh, 75% down and 25%

21:01.685 --> 21:03.102
upon delivery.
No problem at all.

21:03.153 --> 21:05.338
But we would prefer
to pay Ochoa directly.

21:07.157 --> 21:08.474
He's in town, right?

21:08.542 --> 21:11.244
You guys need to get out of here
right now.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.645
Right now.

21:12.696 --> 21:14.447
Whoa, I'm-I'm sorry.
Did we say something wrong?

21:14.498 --> 21:16.082
Uh, no. I just don't like you.

21:17.351 --> 21:18.418
Oh, fantastic.

21:24.058 --> 21:24.874
Freeze! Five-O!

21:24.959 --> 21:26.209
Hands up.

21:27.494 --> 21:29.195
Put it down. Put it down.
We good?

21:29.263 --> 21:30.430
Yeah.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.165
See that?

21:33.217 --> 21:34.217
Where is Ochoa?

21:34.301 --> 21:35.868
I'm not saying a word.

21:35.936 --> 21:37.103
Not one single word.

21:37.171 --> 21:38.638
If you wanted to do it
the hard way,

21:38.689 --> 21:40.473
you should've
just said so.

21:44.728 --> 21:46.696
♪ ♪

21:49.817 --> 21:51.868
Just for the record,
if I pulled something like this,

21:51.952 --> 21:53.903
you would be reading me
the riot act about

21:53.988 --> 21:56.072
proper police procedure.
No. I'd probably just arrest you.

21:59.410 --> 22:00.994
Compared to this, hanging a guy

22:01.061 --> 22:02.195
off the roof
and throwing a guy

22:02.262 --> 22:03.546
in a shark cage
seems pretty tame.

22:06.834 --> 22:08.384
You know what? I disagree.

22:08.469 --> 22:10.103
The shark cage was way worse
than this.

22:10.170 --> 22:11.671
Whatever. You're wrong.
I'm just saying, to be clear,

22:11.722 --> 22:13.873
the next time,
I get free pass, okay?

22:23.517 --> 22:25.318
Help!

22:25.386 --> 22:27.020
Help! Ah!

22:52.713 --> 22:54.130
How you feeling?

22:54.214 --> 22:56.766
Did the ride kick-start
your memory at all?

22:56.850 --> 22:58.518
You're insane.

22:58.585 --> 22:59.852
Where's Ochoa?

22:59.920 --> 23:02.755
I can't, I can't!

23:02.823 --> 23:04.090
It's all right.
It's fine.

23:04.141 --> 23:05.558
- Danny, let's take him around again.
- No, no.

23:05.609 --> 23:06.859
You know what we should do?
Let's loosen these a little bit.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.895
He'll slide a little bit
more, maybe...

23:08.962 --> 23:10.563
That's a good idea.
Got a full tank of gas.

23:10.631 --> 23:12.615
We can do this all night.
No, no!

23:16.653 --> 23:19.872
There's a shipment coming in
tomorrow.

23:19.940 --> 23:23.543
Ochoa is meeting me at Waialua

23:23.610 --> 23:24.827
at the old
coffee plantation.

23:24.912 --> 23:27.413
Okay, how is Ochoa smuggling
cocaine onshore

23:27.481 --> 23:28.948
without getting busted?

23:30.984 --> 23:34.353
He has a man inside... HPD.

23:35.689 --> 23:38.925
Tells him every single
move the cops make.

23:38.992 --> 23:40.226
Who is it?

23:40.293 --> 23:41.627
I have no idea. I do not know.

23:41.695 --> 23:43.062
He's the only one that knows.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.798
Ochoa is the only one
that knows. I swear.

23:45.849 --> 23:46.933
You sure about that?

23:47.000 --> 23:48.968
Absolutely serious.
I swear.

23:53.574 --> 23:56.159
You guys get Bastille
to talk?

23:56.243 --> 23:58.811
Uh, yeah. Danny gave him
a little nudge.

23:58.879 --> 24:00.696
All right,
according to our middleman,

24:00.781 --> 24:02.331
Ochoa's bringing in a big
shipment tomorrow night.

24:02.416 --> 24:03.616
And we're gonna be there
when it happens.

24:03.667 --> 24:04.851
Meka's computer--
anything about who

24:04.918 --> 24:06.953
he was gonna see in Singapore?
No, but in

24:07.020 --> 24:08.287
his deleted Internet history

24:08.355 --> 24:09.839
there's a cloud site
that he visited frequently.

24:09.923 --> 24:11.824
All right, tell me you tapped
into the off-site server.

24:11.875 --> 24:12.692
Oh, yeah.

24:14.511 --> 24:16.329
Wire transfers;
six-figure transactions

24:16.396 --> 24:18.264
from an Ochoa shell corporation
in Mexico

24:18.332 --> 24:20.133
to an encrypted account
in Singapore.

24:20.184 --> 24:22.468
Well, that explains why he was
gonna go there next week.

24:22.536 --> 24:23.836
Why? I don't get it.

24:23.887 --> 24:26.172
Well, Singapore's like
the new Switzerland.

24:26.223 --> 24:28.040
It's one of the few places
post-9/11

24:28.108 --> 24:30.343
that didn't change its banking
confidentiality laws.

24:30.410 --> 24:33.279
So they can actually hide
the account holder's I.D.

24:33.347 --> 24:34.447
even from
the authorities.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.315
Okay, so Meka was on
a money trail, right?

24:36.366 --> 24:37.950
He's going down there,
lean on the bank,

24:38.018 --> 24:39.702
try to find out
who the account holder is.

24:39.787 --> 24:41.520
Yeah, or Meka
was the account holder,

24:41.572 --> 24:42.855
and he was looking to run.

24:45.125 --> 24:46.626
Yeah, or that.

24:46.693 --> 24:49.128
Look, I know you like to remind
me that I'm not a cop.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.880
'Cause you're not.
Yeah, whatever. But I know enough

24:50.964 --> 24:52.698
to realize
that where there's smoke...

24:52.749 --> 24:53.866
Wh-where there's smoke?

24:53.917 --> 24:55.468
Should we write that
on the wall?

24:55.535 --> 24:56.836
"Where there's smoke"?

24:56.904 --> 24:58.537
"Your Honor, he's guilty.
Why? There was smoke."

24:58.589 --> 25:01.841
Busts gone bad, wire transfers,

25:01.892 --> 25:03.643
hidden accounts,
a ticket to Singapore

25:03.710 --> 25:05.561
his wife didn't know
anything about.

25:05.646 --> 25:07.063
I mean, Danny,
I'm just saying.

25:07.147 --> 25:08.481
Meka's taking money from Ochoa,

25:08.548 --> 25:10.550
and then he just decides
to leave the country? Why?

25:10.617 --> 25:12.185
Maybe because I.A.
was closing in on him.

25:12.252 --> 25:14.353
And maybe Ochoa couldn't afford
Meka getting caught

25:14.404 --> 25:15.822
and talking,
so he had him killed.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.090
And this is based on what,
an I.A. witch hunt?

25:18.158 --> 25:19.091
You know what? I'm done.

25:19.159 --> 25:20.693
How about that,
all right?

25:20.761 --> 25:22.028
If my word is not good enough
for you,

25:22.079 --> 25:24.764
then I do not know
what I'm doing here.

25:39.437 --> 25:40.871
Hey, JJ, set me up.

25:41.952 --> 25:43.220
And one more for my buddy here.

25:43.287 --> 25:45.472
Good timing.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.594
His old man was the same way,
you know.

25:50.661 --> 25:52.233
McGarrett's.

25:52.234 --> 25:54.802
They got this laser focus
embedded in their DNA.

25:56.418 --> 25:58.517
That's why it's good sometimes
to remind them

25:58.518 --> 26:00.385
that their way
isn't the only one that works.

26:00.453 --> 26:03.689
Yeah? Right now somewhere
Steve just twitched.

26:06.664 --> 26:08.949
He'll come around.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.484
Thank you.

26:12.203 --> 26:13.887
Thank you.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.327
By the way,

26:20.378 --> 26:22.663
I really admire
what you're doing for Meka.

26:22.730 --> 26:24.881
Same thing anybody would do.

26:24.966 --> 26:26.566
I wish that
were true, bro.

26:26.634 --> 26:29.069
Would've saved me
a lot of grief.

26:29.137 --> 26:33.040
Truth is, when a bully like Cage
is on the attack,

26:33.107 --> 26:35.108
most guys back down.

26:35.176 --> 26:36.476
They get so quiet,

26:36.544 --> 26:38.779
you'd think their mouths
were glued shut.

26:38.846 --> 26:42.149
Yeah, well, it makes me sick
no one stuck up for you.

26:42.216 --> 26:45.185
Well, Cage comes hard, bro.

26:45.253 --> 26:47.287
He was convinced
I was on the take,

26:47.355 --> 26:49.656
so he convinced
everyone else of it, too.

26:49.724 --> 26:54.795
The lengths he went to,
to try and expose me.

26:54.862 --> 26:56.163
You know he tapped my phones?

26:56.230 --> 26:58.999
He went through my garbage.

26:59.067 --> 27:01.601
He talked to my lieutenants,
my old partner.

27:01.669 --> 27:02.869
He kept digging

27:02.920 --> 27:04.972
and digging until
he could find any weakness,

27:05.039 --> 27:06.540
anything he could exploit.

27:06.607 --> 27:10.377
Eventually, he put a cloud
of guilt so thick over my head,

27:10.445 --> 27:13.213
he turned my desk into
a ghost town.

27:15.717 --> 27:16.850
Loneliest place

27:16.901 --> 27:18.952
on Earth
is where no one believes you.

27:19.020 --> 27:20.937
Hey,

27:21.022 --> 27:23.323
I got your back now,
buddy, all right?

27:24.558 --> 27:27.494
And I'm in your corner
a thousand percent.

27:27.562 --> 27:29.196
So you tell me what you need.

27:30.398 --> 27:33.667
I need to clear Meka's name.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.236
So I think I gotta listen
to McGarrett.

27:36.287 --> 27:38.071
I got to go see somebody.

28:13.674 --> 28:15.742
You, uh, you look horrible,

28:15.810 --> 28:17.110
Sang Min.

28:17.178 --> 28:19.813
I've been in solitary
for 30 days.

28:19.881 --> 28:21.748
What's your excuse?

28:21.816 --> 28:25.252
Oh, must be all the sunshine
I'm getting on the outside.

28:25.319 --> 28:26.853
So just you?

28:26.921 --> 28:28.288
Where's that little hottie

28:28.356 --> 28:30.090
surfer girl
who set me up?

28:30.141 --> 28:31.391
She's busy.

28:31.476 --> 28:33.260
Uh, but she ask me to punch you
in the mouth for her.

28:33.327 --> 28:35.062
Oh, still spicy, huh?

28:35.129 --> 28:36.363
Yeah. You done?

28:36.431 --> 28:37.831
Relax.

28:37.899 --> 28:40.434
I can't touch her
for at least another 20 years.

28:41.836 --> 28:45.806
Um, I need a name, Sang Min.

28:48.271 --> 28:50.339
How's your family, Detective?

28:51.540 --> 28:53.574
You have a daughter, right?

28:54.406 --> 28:56.626
You see her enough?

28:56.627 --> 28:59.195
Listen, I will come back
for a social visit next week,

28:59.263 --> 29:01.998
but right now,
I need that name.

29:02.065 --> 29:04.467
I didn't talk before. What makes
you think I'm gonna start now?

29:04.534 --> 29:07.386
All right. Don't say anything.

29:07.471 --> 29:08.537
Hey. Don't say anything.

29:08.589 --> 29:10.573
Look at this picture.
Just nod.

29:10.641 --> 29:12.275
Nod yes or no.
Is this him?

29:12.342 --> 29:13.776
I'm done here.

29:13.844 --> 29:14.811
Hold on. Hold on.
Listen to me.

29:14.878 --> 29:15.812
Pick up the phone.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.847
Pick up the phone.

29:17.915 --> 29:19.115
Pick up the phone.

29:22.152 --> 29:25.688
Was Meka Hanamoa the one
feeding you inside information?

29:25.739 --> 29:26.956
Was he your mole
on the inside?

29:27.024 --> 29:29.892
Was he your mole in
the police department?

29:29.960 --> 29:31.527
Why so important to you?

29:35.199 --> 29:37.116
Because he was a friend of mine.

29:37.201 --> 29:38.801
All right?

29:38.869 --> 29:41.003
And this is what happened
to him.

29:41.071 --> 29:43.840
He's got a wife

29:43.907 --> 29:45.308
and a young son.

29:45.375 --> 29:48.211
And now they are on their own.

29:48.278 --> 29:49.712
That's gotta hit home

29:49.780 --> 29:50.880
for you.

29:50.948 --> 29:52.915
HPD is gonna cut
his family off

29:52.966 --> 29:54.116
from all the
benefits he earned.

29:54.184 --> 29:55.518
All right? They're gonna
put them on the street.

29:55.586 --> 29:57.286
All because of what they think
that he did.

29:57.354 --> 29:59.455
So I'm asking you...

29:59.523 --> 30:01.424
was it him?

30:01.491 --> 30:03.492
Look at the photo.

30:08.465 --> 30:12.001
Huh?

30:14.605 --> 30:18.975
If you want me
to risk my safety, Detective,

30:19.042 --> 30:21.844
then I set the terms of our deal

30:21.912 --> 30:24.130
before I tell you
anything.

30:24.214 --> 30:27.016
What do you want?

30:30.587 --> 30:32.588
Thanks.

30:35.058 --> 30:37.193
Sang Min?

30:37.261 --> 30:39.145
He give you anything?

30:39.229 --> 30:40.563
What are you doing here?

30:40.630 --> 30:41.998
I came to ask you
a question.

30:42.065 --> 30:44.233
You did? Well, if
it's to the prom,

30:44.301 --> 30:45.401
I already have a date,
but I'm flattered.

30:45.469 --> 30:46.936
Thank you.
That's funny.

30:48.672 --> 30:49.605
Look, man, I know you're pissed.
All right?

30:49.673 --> 30:50.740
I'm just trying
to figure out

30:50.807 --> 30:52.575
if it's because they
told you Meka was dirty,

30:52.643 --> 30:54.277
or if it's because you found out
he actually was dirty,

30:54.328 --> 30:55.544
and you didn't know about it.

30:55.612 --> 30:58.381
Okay. Listen to me.
This is not an ego thing.

30:58.448 --> 31:00.616
Okay? This is
about Meka.

31:00.667 --> 31:02.919
He would not move off
to Singapore

31:02.986 --> 31:04.487
and leave his wife and his kid.
You understand?

31:04.554 --> 31:06.155
I know that
because he was my friend.

31:06.206 --> 31:07.323
He was my partner.

31:07.391 --> 31:08.891
Right. But what is it
you cops always say?

31:08.959 --> 31:10.426
Don't ignore the evidence.

31:10.527 --> 31:13.262
Okay. All right,
but let me ask you a question.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.932
Let's say I.A. accused me
of skimming off a drug lord,

31:15.999 --> 31:17.633
and they showed you
a stack of evidence

31:17.701 --> 31:19.268
that suggested I did it.

31:19.336 --> 31:21.103
Would you believe them?
No, I wouldn't.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.104
Why not?

31:23.840 --> 31:25.341
Exactly.

31:27.227 --> 31:28.344
Okay.

31:28.412 --> 31:29.729
Yeah? Okay what?

31:29.813 --> 31:31.948
Okay, we can move on, okay.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.516
We got a location on Ochoa?

31:33.583 --> 31:34.517
Uh-huh.

31:34.584 --> 31:36.919
Good. We got a takedown to plan.

31:36.987 --> 31:40.122
<i>We appreciate you wanting</i>
<i>to help, Detective Kaleo.</i>

31:40.190 --> 31:41.791
<i>Name of the game is stealth.</i>

31:41.858 --> 31:43.793
Okay? Ochoa. He has a
meeting on the books

31:43.860 --> 31:46.862
with his middleman Bastille
right here

31:46.930 --> 31:48.364
it's an old coffee plantation.

31:48.415 --> 31:50.132
We're gonna make sure the
meeting happens as planned.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.300
Except, I take it,
Bastille will have

31:51.368 --> 31:52.468
a couple new bodyguards
escorting him?

31:52.535 --> 31:53.703
Exactly.

31:53.770 --> 31:55.087
But nobody makes a move
until we see the coke

31:55.172 --> 31:56.538
and the deal
is in play.

31:56.590 --> 31:58.140
We do this by the book,
or the charges don't stick.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.226
Yeah. No cowboy crap,
all right?

32:00.310 --> 32:01.477
We need him alive,
able to speak.

32:01.545 --> 32:03.545
What about SWAT or air support?

32:03.597 --> 32:06.015
No. Ochoa senses any backup,
he'll be in the wind.

32:06.083 --> 32:08.050
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

32:08.118 --> 32:09.435
Oh, hey, Sergeant.
It's called police work.

32:09.519 --> 32:11.687
I got a book,
explain the whole thing to you.

32:11.755 --> 32:12.938
Word in Narcotics is

32:13.023 --> 32:15.024
you're going after Ochoa.
That true?

32:15.092 --> 32:16.776
I'm not at liberty to say.

32:16.860 --> 32:17.860
Listen to me, Detective.

32:17.928 --> 32:18.894
I've been working with the DEA

32:18.945 --> 32:20.279
on a RICO case for months now,

32:20.364 --> 32:23.165
so if you're going after
Ochoa, I'm coming with you.

32:23.233 --> 32:24.567
Hey. In my office,
you listen to me, Sergeant.

32:24.634 --> 32:25.968
DEA-- what are you
talking about?

32:26.036 --> 32:29.288
They approached HPD about a
number of blown Narco cases,

32:29.373 --> 32:30.840
cases specifically involving

32:30.907 --> 32:32.875
your friend Meka
and Emilio Ochoa.

32:32.926 --> 32:35.478
Then, for some reason,
Meka got himself killed.

32:35.545 --> 32:37.013
We think it's because
he got greedy.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.347
You think it's because
he was gonna take down Ochoa.

32:38.415 --> 32:41.617
I want to know which one
of us is right. Don't you?

32:45.989 --> 32:47.606
Well, I was just starting
to get used to my cell.

32:47.691 --> 32:49.025
By the way,

32:49.092 --> 32:51.093
just so we're all aware,
Ochoa's going to kill us.

32:51.144 --> 32:53.396
Shut up, you. Okay?

32:53.463 --> 32:54.563
Or you're surfing
the hood again,

32:54.614 --> 32:55.865
this time with no cords.

32:55.932 --> 32:57.316
Be preferable to your
current plan 'cause at least

32:57.401 --> 32:58.501
I have some chance
of surviving it.

32:58.568 --> 32:59.652
Just be cool, okay?

32:59.736 --> 33:00.653
You're picking up
another shipment.

33:00.737 --> 33:02.505
It's nothing out
of the ordinary.

33:02.572 --> 33:04.040
- You got it?
- All right, listen, van Gogh.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.475
All you got to do is get Ochoa
to show us the goods,

33:06.543 --> 33:08.210
and then we will
take care of the rest.

33:08.278 --> 33:09.611
You understand?

33:11.415 --> 33:13.082
What... what are you
smirking at? Huh?

33:13.190 --> 33:15.080
Nothing. I just...
the no tie thing-- I like it.

33:15.168 --> 33:17.186
You're starting to look
like you actually fit in.

33:17.254 --> 33:19.088
Yeah, well,
don't get used to it, okay?

33:47.984 --> 33:50.286
If we want him to talk,
we need him alive.

33:50.337 --> 33:51.537
Yeah, I know.

33:51.621 --> 33:53.255
Don't quote me to me.

33:55.058 --> 33:58.727
Emilio, you're looking
sharp as usual.

33:58.795 --> 33:59.962
What is-what is that, Armani?

34:00.013 --> 34:01.046
That-that-that really look...

34:01.131 --> 34:02.865
Or Zegna.
Which-which is...

34:02.933 --> 34:04.300
Well, whatever
it is, though,

34:04.367 --> 34:05.534
it really
looks great.

34:05.602 --> 34:07.002
You got what
we agreed on?

34:07.070 --> 34:08.219
Yeah. Yeah.

34:08.304 --> 34:09.938
Of course.
Okay, then.

34:10.005 --> 34:11.841
Let's get on
with it.

34:16.847 --> 34:19.014
Why are you sweating?

34:20.550 --> 34:22.284
You nervous?

34:22.351 --> 34:24.786
No. I... it's 110 degrees
out here,

34:24.855 --> 34:26.255
and I've got
thin blood.

34:26.322 --> 34:27.790
And I, uh...

34:27.858 --> 34:28.791
didn't put deodorant on today.

34:28.859 --> 34:29.909
The heat's just killing me, man.

34:29.993 --> 34:31.793
Yeah, of course.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.161
But business is good?

34:33.230 --> 34:35.598
Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's booming.

34:35.665 --> 34:38.000
Booming?

34:38.068 --> 34:40.069
That's excellent.

34:41.737 --> 34:43.172
I see you have new men.

34:43.239 --> 34:45.107
Oh, yeah.

34:45.175 --> 34:46.509
Their names?

34:46.560 --> 34:48.143
Christopher

34:48.210 --> 34:49.344
and Wallace.

34:51.581 --> 34:53.681
You know, I didn't expect
to be meeting new people.

34:55.385 --> 34:57.853
I-I won't do that again,
I guess.

34:59.739 --> 35:01.056
Anyway, it's great to see you,

35:01.107 --> 35:02.942
and, uh, so...

35:03.026 --> 35:04.893
if we're...
if we're done here...

35:04.945 --> 35:06.529
I don't like new people.

35:06.596 --> 35:07.997
You know that.

35:13.803 --> 35:15.437
I can't do this.

35:16.706 --> 35:18.290
Freeze! HPD!

35:34.724 --> 35:36.058
There goes Ochoa!

35:36.126 --> 35:37.726
I got him!

36:01.835 --> 36:03.619
What happened? Huh?

36:03.670 --> 36:06.288
We needed him alive.
What happened?

36:08.458 --> 36:10.893
He drew on me.
I had no choice.

36:16.032 --> 36:18.150
I'm sorry, Danny.

36:33.035 --> 36:36.270
Yeah, there's not going to be
a... a trial.

36:37.075 --> 36:40.528
They said they'd pay for
the basic cost of the funeral,

36:40.595 --> 36:43.664
but they won't do
the whole ceremony.

36:43.732 --> 36:46.133
I know. I know. Me, neither.

36:48.236 --> 36:49.670
All right, listen.

36:49.738 --> 36:53.774
Um, I-I'll come by in a...
in a couple hours, okay?

36:54.810 --> 36:56.076
Amy?

36:56.128 --> 36:57.878
Yep.

36:57.946 --> 37:00.014
I'm not done with this. I'm not.

37:00.082 --> 37:01.349
I know you're not.

37:01.416 --> 37:02.683
Neither are we, man.

37:02.751 --> 37:05.252
We got you.

37:05.303 --> 37:06.921
Coroner report's back.

37:06.989 --> 37:09.490
Ballistics confirm
that the .45 on Ochoa

37:09.558 --> 37:11.692
was the same gun
used to killed Meka.

37:11.760 --> 37:12.660
And there's something else.

37:12.728 --> 37:14.261
Check out
the circular marks

37:14.329 --> 37:16.097
around the bullet holes.

37:16.164 --> 37:18.065
Muzzle burns.

37:18.116 --> 37:19.500
According to the M.E.,

37:19.568 --> 37:21.402
Kaleo had to be
in pretty close range

37:21.453 --> 37:22.903
to leave marks like that.
That's not self-defense.

37:22.954 --> 37:24.105
Looks more like
an execution to me.

37:24.172 --> 37:26.107
So why didn't
Ochoa shoot

37:26.174 --> 37:27.375
if Kaleo was that close to him?

37:27.442 --> 37:28.609
Maybe Ochoa
didn't feel like Kaleo

37:28.660 --> 37:30.044
was a threat,
because he knew him.

37:30.111 --> 37:32.013
Hold on. Hold on.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.715
Or it wasn't Ochoa's .45.

37:35.817 --> 37:37.051
Kaleo...

37:37.119 --> 37:39.720
Kaleo planted that gun on Ochoa
after he killed him.

37:39.788 --> 37:41.422
Oh, that was mean.

37:41.490 --> 37:43.290
I don't know how the hell
it happened.

37:43.358 --> 37:44.642
Ochoa had me dead to rights.

37:44.726 --> 37:46.861
I was just lucky
to get the first shot off.

37:46.928 --> 37:48.596
Lucky?

37:48.647 --> 37:50.798
You know...

37:50.866 --> 37:53.350
it takes
a lot more than luck

37:53.435 --> 37:55.302
to do what you did.

37:55.353 --> 37:57.571
To pull off what
you pulled off.

37:57.639 --> 37:59.640
I mean, I'm
actually impressed.

37:59.691 --> 38:00.741
What are you
talking about?

38:00.809 --> 38:01.909
What are you
doing here?

38:01.976 --> 38:04.045
Let me ask you a question,
because...

38:04.112 --> 38:06.247
I'm just curious--
with Ochoa dead

38:06.314 --> 38:09.083
and this case closed,
does it bother you at all

38:09.151 --> 38:12.253
that I.A. still thinks
Meka's the mole?

38:12.320 --> 38:15.423
I mean, I don't want
to believe it, but if they got

38:15.490 --> 38:16.891
evidence to prove...
Evidence.

38:16.958 --> 38:19.260
Funny thing about that.
What's this?

38:19.327 --> 38:20.828
They're records
of wire transfers

38:20.896 --> 38:23.097
from Ochoa to an
account in Singapore.

38:23.165 --> 38:25.599
You see, Meka was on his way
to meet authorities there

38:25.667 --> 38:26.901
to get them
to release the identity

38:26.968 --> 38:28.168
of the account holder.

38:28.220 --> 38:30.304
So? What's that got
to do with me?

38:30.372 --> 38:34.308
Everything, considering
the account was yours.

38:38.146 --> 38:40.281
Get the hell out
of my face, <i>haole.</i>

38:40.348 --> 38:42.316
Case is over.
We got the guy.

38:42.367 --> 38:45.953
You have been selling out
this department for months--

38:46.021 --> 38:47.154
selling out
these guys--

38:47.205 --> 38:48.989
to anybody willing
to pay the price.

38:49.057 --> 38:50.357
All right?

38:50.425 --> 38:51.659
And Meka found
out about it.

38:51.710 --> 38:53.828
My friend found out about it,
so you shot him.

38:53.895 --> 38:56.897
You shot him, and you
threw him in a fire pit.

38:56.965 --> 38:58.666
Then you killed Ochoa,

38:58.733 --> 38:59.900
and you planted
the gun on him

38:59.968 --> 39:01.969
so it'd look like
he killed Meka.

39:02.036 --> 39:03.971
And what you did--
look at me--

39:04.038 --> 39:05.906
what you did was impressive

39:05.974 --> 39:08.559
because you thought
you cleaned everything up,

39:08.643 --> 39:11.879
but you made one mistake,
because you're stupid.

39:16.384 --> 39:17.384
That's him.

39:19.070 --> 39:20.821
You killed my friend.

39:20.889 --> 39:22.606
Sit down.

39:26.444 --> 39:28.061
Danny.

39:48.283 --> 39:50.284
♪ ♪

40:01.479 --> 40:04.865
I can give you a minute
to talk to them if you want.

40:15.043 --> 40:17.011
No.

40:17.078 --> 40:20.080
I've caused my wife and son
enough pain.

40:21.783 --> 40:23.317
But thank you.

40:24.986 --> 40:27.488
For keeping your word.

41:19.691 --> 41:21.976
I found that last night.

41:23.778 --> 41:25.713
The ceremony today,

41:25.780 --> 41:27.698
all those people showing up--

41:27.782 --> 41:29.717
it was lovely.

41:29.784 --> 41:31.702
It meant everything.

41:31.786 --> 41:33.887
Meka deserved it.

41:34.923 --> 41:36.907
Thank you.

41:38.243 --> 41:39.994
Come here.

41:43.248 --> 41:45.266
You okay?

41:47.302 --> 41:49.219
Mrs. Hanamoa?

41:49.304 --> 41:52.806
The Honolulu Police Department
offers its deepest

41:52.874 --> 41:55.843
and sincerest apologies
for your loss.

41:55.910 --> 41:57.511
Your husband
will be remembered

41:57.579 --> 41:59.346
for giving his life
in the line of duty

41:59.414 --> 42:02.216
and protecting the island
of Oahu.

42:05.153 --> 42:07.021
Detective Williams.

42:07.072 --> 42:09.073
Sergeant Cage.

42:13.445 --> 42:15.446
Hey, buddy.

42:16.448 --> 42:18.449
I got something for you.

42:25.573 --> 42:29.276
Hey, your dad was
a great, great man.

42:29.344 --> 42:31.745
Okay, I want you to
remember that always, okay?

42:32.747 --> 42:35.482
All right? Cool.

42:37.252 --> 42:39.853
Oh. I'm glad they came.

42:41.106 --> 42:42.690
Excuse me one second.

42:42.757 --> 42:45.109
What are you guys doing here?

42:45.193 --> 42:47.444
We came to pay our respects.

42:47.529 --> 42:49.863
- You all right?
- Yeah.

42:49.931 --> 42:51.031
Thank you.
All right.

42:51.099 --> 42:53.067
Hey. Thanks.

42:56.838 --> 42:58.105
I appreciate you being here.

42:58.173 --> 42:59.907
I know you didn't know him.

42:59.974 --> 43:02.309
I know you.

43:02.377 --> 43:04.812
Thank you.

43:04.879 --> 43:06.880
Come on.

43:10.585 --> 43:12.503
