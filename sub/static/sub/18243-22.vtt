00:06.441 --> 00:06.963
Previously on
"Just Add Magic"...

00:07.050 --> 00:09.748
Darbie: I thought
Noelle was the one who
attacked RJ and Mama P.

00:09.835 --> 00:12.882
If Noelle didn't do it,
then we're out of suspects.

00:12.969 --> 00:14.884
You're looking at
Murder Masquerade's
new head of crew.

00:14.971 --> 00:16.146
I just really
want to be mayor,

00:16.233 --> 00:17.843
and I'm gonna do
whatever I have to do.

00:17.930 --> 00:20.759
I think I paid you enough.
Find dirt on Terri.

00:20.846 --> 00:22.457
Gina: Look, the knife,
fork and spoon logo.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.155
Becky: It's just
a bunch of junk.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.244
What a beautiful clubhouse.

00:27.331 --> 00:28.811
I guess Chuck
was good for something.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.421
Who's Chuck?

00:31.553 --> 00:33.555
Oh, no.

00:37.863 --> 00:38.821
- Finally.
- What's up?

00:38.908 --> 00:40.736
Your text
sounded urgent.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.912
Yeah, the last time
you used two periods
and no emojis

00:42.999 --> 00:45.262
you were telling me
"Earls of Wembley"
had been cancelled.

00:45.349 --> 00:47.569
This is way more
important.

00:47.656 --> 00:50.441
This morning I noticed
an unopened voice mail
on my phone.

00:50.528 --> 00:51.747
People still
leave those?

00:51.834 --> 00:53.531
My grandma does,
and you have to hear it.

00:53.618 --> 00:56.186
She lost her memory of magic
right in the middle of it.

00:56.273 --> 00:57.579
- What?
- How did you know?

00:57.666 --> 01:00.060
Here. Listen.

01:00.147 --> 01:02.453
Kelly, it's me.
Call me right away.

01:02.540 --> 01:05.369
I have some information
that's very important.

01:05.456 --> 01:06.805
There's a box,

01:06.892 --> 01:09.112
and the book is the key
to the magic...

01:10.809 --> 01:14.030
Huh. Totally lost
my train of thought.

01:14.117 --> 01:17.251
Uh... must be having
a senior moment.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.035
See you soon, sweetie.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.167
It sounds like
she was spelled

01:20.254 --> 01:21.777
right in the middle
of her sentence.

01:21.864 --> 01:23.518
What was the box
she was talking about?

01:23.605 --> 01:26.347
I have no idea.
She's never
mentioned it before.

01:26.434 --> 01:28.175
Well, clearly she's found
something important.

01:28.262 --> 01:29.828
And it sounds like
it scared her.

01:29.915 --> 01:32.396
Whatever it was,
we need to find out.

01:33.963 --> 01:36.879
♪♪

01:41.231 --> 01:42.841
Must be having
a senior moment.

01:42.928 --> 01:45.540
See you soon, sweetie.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.933
She forgot about magic
mid sentence?

01:48.020 --> 01:49.674
Yep.
Just like RJ.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.198
And she was about to say
something important.

01:51.285 --> 01:53.113
Hate that.

01:53.200 --> 01:57.247
Like when someone
turns off the car radio
right before the chorus.

01:57.334 --> 02:00.337
- But of course,
this is way worse.
- Yeah.

02:00.424 --> 02:02.687
I know the box
she's talking about.

02:02.774 --> 02:04.341
You do?

02:04.428 --> 02:07.039
Becky called last week
and asked me to come over.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.651
She'd found an old box
in the antique store

02:09.738 --> 02:12.393
with the knife, fork and
spoon emblem carved into it.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.481
- What?
- Whoa.

02:13.568 --> 02:15.526
Why didn't you guys
tell us?

02:15.613 --> 02:18.660
All that was inside
was some random stuff
from the '90s.

02:18.747 --> 02:20.488
It seemed like
a dead end.

02:20.575 --> 02:22.229
Grandma still should have
said something.

02:22.316 --> 02:24.579
Becky was waiting 'til
she had more information

02:24.666 --> 02:25.754
before worrying you.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.234
Well,
that logic failed.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.714
Now we're worried
and know nothing.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.281
Come on,
let's find that box.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.242
Miss Silvers.

02:35.329 --> 02:36.765
You should come with.

02:36.852 --> 02:39.637
Can't. I've got
a lot of work to do.

02:39.724 --> 02:43.075
I'm playing at Terri's
campaign fundraiser tonight.
Remember?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.555
I know, it's just...

02:44.642 --> 02:47.079
the last two people to lose
their memory of magic

02:47.167 --> 02:49.560
were Grandma Becky
and Mama P.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.910
- I'm afraid that--
- You think I'm next.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.564
Not if we can
keep you safe.

02:53.651 --> 02:54.783
Playing piano
in public tonight

02:54.870 --> 02:56.306
doesn't sound
safe to me.

02:56.393 --> 02:59.875
Well, I'm doing it.
I'm not running scared.

02:59.962 --> 03:02.094
I appreciate
your concern, girls,

03:02.182 --> 03:05.141
but we don't really know
if I am a target.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.751
Besides,
I promised your mother.

03:08.362 --> 03:10.233
We can cook.
There's gotta be some way

03:10.320 --> 03:12.453
to keep you safe and
honor your commitment
to play tonight.

03:12.540 --> 03:13.802
I don't know, girls.

03:13.889 --> 03:16.152
Please.
Do it for us.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.026
[sighs]
All right.

03:21.113 --> 03:23.203
Great,
but we should probably
cook at the Quinn's.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.205
Pretty sure this is
the first place
they'll come looking.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.945
When you put it
that way...

03:28.000 --> 03:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:36.259 --> 03:37.826
- Pardon me.
- Oh.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.181
Clever.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.749
So, what's the plan?

03:47.836 --> 03:49.403
First we look through
the book.

03:49.490 --> 03:52.841
No, first we get snacks.
There's nothing good in here.

03:52.928 --> 03:55.800
Wouldn't want you
to starve, Darbie.

03:55.887 --> 03:59.282
You guys get started,
I'll get us something
to eat.

03:59.369 --> 04:01.458
Don't worry.
This happens in politics
all the time.

04:01.545 --> 04:02.981
I'm telling you.

04:03.068 --> 04:04.896
Mom. What's wrong?

04:04.983 --> 04:06.376
Your mom's totally
losing her cool.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.639
Uh, I think I'm
reacting appropriately,

04:08.726 --> 04:10.162
given the situation.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.860
Remember that
yoga studio I had?

04:11.947 --> 04:13.949
Yeah, you closed it when
you went back to school.

04:14.036 --> 04:15.516
Yes, to get my masters.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.213
Well, Lever is claiming
that it failed,

04:17.300 --> 04:18.954
and I'm not fit
to be a leader.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.086
- What? Why would he do that?
- That's what I said.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.523
Wow. Like mother,
like daughter.

04:22.610 --> 04:25.090
Ugh! No one was even
doing yoga in Saffron Falls

04:25.177 --> 04:26.962
until I opened my studio,

04:27.049 --> 04:29.007
and now they're just
namaste-ing
on every corner.

04:29.094 --> 04:30.357
I promise you
this is nothing.

04:30.444 --> 04:32.010
Can I help?

04:32.097 --> 04:34.274
I'm already introducing you
at the fundraiser tonight.

04:34.361 --> 04:37.494
- Maybe I can say more.
- Oh, no, sweetie,
an intro's enough,

04:37.581 --> 04:40.192
and we'll work on
pulling my reputation
out of the gutter.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.891
Oh, come on,
drama queen,
let's go.

04:42.978 --> 04:43.935
See you later.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.336
You'll never guess
what spell we found.

04:53.423 --> 04:55.120
It's cloning.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.732
It's cloning.
Sorry, I could not wait
for her to guess.

04:57.819 --> 05:00.387
Evidently.

05:00.474 --> 05:02.867
The recipe is for
a Carrot Dupli-Cake.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.739
So, who are we cloning?

05:04.826 --> 05:06.306
Me.

05:06.393 --> 05:09.483
The plan is to create
a decoy Miss Silvers,

05:09.570 --> 05:11.311
someone who will
go about her normal day,

05:11.398 --> 05:13.313
and play at the
campaign event tonight.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.836
That way,
if anyone tries,

05:14.923 --> 05:16.707
they'll spell the wrong
Gina Silvers.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.840
Plus, if you have
clone Silvers with you
at Mama P's today,

05:18.927 --> 05:20.363
you can keep
an eye on her,

05:20.450 --> 05:22.713
and if anything goes down,
you can catch the culprit.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.889
Like a bait and switch.
So smart.

05:24.976 --> 05:27.152
- Let's get cooking.
- I know I say this a lot,

05:27.239 --> 05:29.764
- but this is actually--
- The best spell ever?

05:29.851 --> 05:31.461
Well, top three
at least.

05:31.548 --> 05:32.593
[chuckling]

05:32.680 --> 05:35.552
♪♪

05:57.531 --> 05:59.315
All right, Miss Silvers,
are you ready?

05:59.402 --> 06:01.361
Ready as I'll ever be.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.760
I don't think
you understand

06:09.847 --> 06:11.501
how disappointed I'll be
if this doesn't work.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.550
What the heck?

06:18.639 --> 06:22.251
You girls have any
merwaldian tea?
My back is killing me.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.035
So awesome.

06:24.122 --> 06:25.515
And a little creepy.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.604
Is that really what
my voice sounds like?

06:27.691 --> 06:29.954
Hello?
Merwaldian tea?

06:30.041 --> 06:32.392
No merwaldian tea.
Sorry.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.176
Water can help
the joints, though.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.874
- Yes, I'm aware.
- Right.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.615
I guess you are.

06:38.702 --> 06:41.052
Okay.
The plan worked.

06:41.139 --> 06:43.098
Now, we have to get
that Miss Silvers to
Mama P's

06:43.185 --> 06:44.795
where we'll help
set up for tonight.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.928
Anyone have any
Merwaldian tea?

06:47.015 --> 06:50.497
- My back is killing me.
- That makes two of us.

06:50.584 --> 06:54.457
Uh, I think you mean
that makes three of us.

06:54.544 --> 06:57.242
Three clones?
The recipe was only
supposed to make one.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.419
Is anyone gonna
answer me?

06:59.506 --> 07:00.942
It's like I'm
talking to myself.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.989
All: Seriously.

07:05.076 --> 07:07.078
Okay, we need
a new plan fast.

07:10.734 --> 07:13.258
[whispering]
I mean, if they can find out
about the yoga business,

07:13.345 --> 07:14.999
they can find out
about this, too.

07:15.086 --> 07:17.437
Terri, I know you do well
with the senior voters,

07:17.524 --> 07:20.614
but even they
aren't talking about
the old main library.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.616
Nobody's digging that deep
through city records.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.922
Well, okay.
I hope you're right.

07:25.009 --> 07:29.144
Look, it's way easier
than you think to hide
your past.

07:29.231 --> 07:31.625
Sorry to interrupt,
mayor, [chuckles]

07:31.712 --> 07:33.322
but can I get you two
something to eat?

07:33.409 --> 07:35.280
Thanks, Ida, but
I'm not mayor yet.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.065
Well, not with
that attitude.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.327
[chuckles]

07:47.684 --> 07:49.512
Okay, we figured out
the problem.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.471
It would appear we
over mixed the batter,

07:51.558 --> 07:53.908
making three clones
instead of just one.

07:53.995 --> 07:55.126
Rookie mistake.

07:55.213 --> 07:57.128
Oh, calm down,
they're just kids.

07:57.215 --> 07:59.261
Well, she was
supervising.

07:59.348 --> 08:03.091
- Excuse you.
- Please don't start
bickering again.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.006
We've decided to
split you up.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.008
Yeah. If somebody saw
all four of you in one room,

08:07.095 --> 08:08.531
they'd panic.

08:08.618 --> 08:11.142
And you don't exactly
get along with yourself.

08:11.229 --> 08:12.579
[slurping]

08:12.666 --> 08:15.538
Could you please not slurp
your tea so loudly.

08:15.625 --> 08:19.847
- It wasn't me, it's her.
- No, it's not, it's you.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.370
Miss Silvers,
could you put this on?

08:21.457 --> 08:23.459
All: Put what on?

08:23.546 --> 08:25.374
Oh, I'm sorry,
I meant the real Silvers.

08:30.205 --> 08:32.076
That way,
if anything goes wrong,

08:32.163 --> 08:33.643
we know who
the real Silvers is.

08:33.730 --> 08:37.342
- Good idea.
- So, here's the plan.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.344
Silvers A,
you'll come with me
to Mama P's

08:39.431 --> 08:41.607
- to help set up
for tonight.
- Fine.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.784
Silvers B,
you'll go with Hannah
to the antique store

08:43.871 --> 08:45.089
to track down the box
that Grandma found.

08:45.176 --> 08:47.091
- Great.
- And Silvers C,

08:47.178 --> 08:49.311
you'll go to school
with Darbie
to help at rehearsal.

08:49.398 --> 08:52.096
How fun.

08:52.183 --> 08:53.315
Do you think
all the clones

08:53.402 --> 08:55.099
are just as weird
as Miss Silvers?

08:55.186 --> 08:57.667
Yes, Darbie, that's
the definition of a clone.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.321
And she's not
that weird.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.366
So what do I do all day?

09:01.453 --> 09:03.107
Glad you asked.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.547
Are you kidding me?

09:07.634 --> 09:09.679
- We over mixed the batter--
- I don't even want to know.

09:09.766 --> 09:11.507
So, can you watch
OS today?

09:11.594 --> 09:15.163
- OS?
- That's me.
Original Silvers.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.165
Please, Jake,
it's just for
the afternoon.

09:17.252 --> 09:18.775
- I'm busy.
- But Mama P's is closed

09:18.862 --> 09:20.560
to prepare for
the fundraising event.

09:20.647 --> 09:23.345
You know I do things
other than work at
Mama P's, right?

09:23.432 --> 09:25.652
I don't have time to
baby sit all day.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.523
- No offense, Miss Silvers.
- All: None taken.

09:29.917 --> 09:33.485
Please.
You saw what happened to
Mama P and my grandma.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.793
We can't risk Miss Silvers
losing her memory of magic,
too.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.490
And there's wifi
in the trailer.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.535
And plenty of food.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.018
- Fine. I'll do it.
- Thank you.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.062
- Thanks, Jake.
- You're the best.

09:45.149 --> 09:46.803
All: Yes,
thank you, Jake.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.283
Okay, now that's
just creepy.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.988
So, uh, want to sit
in the audience,

09:58.075 --> 09:59.250
watch the rehearsal?

09:59.337 --> 10:00.948
I'm good here.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.602
Okay.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.255
Want to see
the secret door
we're building?

10:04.342 --> 10:05.605
Sure.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.219
[creaking]

10:20.837 --> 10:24.101
It'll look cooler
when it fully spins open,

10:24.188 --> 10:26.147
and it looks like
a bookshelf.

10:26.234 --> 10:27.801
I certainly hope so.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.547
- Hey, Darbs.
- Hey, Piper.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.071
[whispers] Please don't
leave us here alone.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.638
Who is that?

10:38.725 --> 10:43.686
Uh, my family friend,
or neighbor, I guess.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.601
My scene is almost up.
You have a tea cup?

10:45.688 --> 10:48.560
You got it.
Here you go.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.823
How do I look?

10:49.910 --> 10:51.694
Just dashing, darling.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.478
You're doing it wrong.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.176
I am?

10:55.263 --> 10:58.222
- Miss Silvers.
- What?

10:58.309 --> 10:59.963
When you hold a tea cup,

11:00.050 --> 11:01.312
you should
place your finger

11:01.399 --> 11:03.140
to the front and back
of the handle

11:03.227 --> 11:05.403
with your pinky
slightly raised.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.448
Like this?

11:06.535 --> 11:08.711
Much better.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.887
[British accent]
It's like you're
straight out of old England.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.367
Thanks for the tip.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.506
Did my business close?
Yes.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.683
But that's not
the whole story.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.816
I closed my business
so I could go back to school
to get my masters.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.253
Jeez,
what'd those flowers
ever do to you?

11:29.340 --> 11:31.734
They're not fitting
like they're supposed to.

11:31.821 --> 11:34.606
Well, you want
a few tips?

11:34.694 --> 11:35.999
Sure.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.479
You should always
cut the stems

11:37.566 --> 11:39.263
before putting them
into water.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.265
And if you have
tight buds,

11:41.352 --> 11:43.354
warm water will
help them to open up.

11:43.441 --> 11:44.965
Got it. Thanks.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.881
The bouquet height should be
one and half times higher

11:47.968 --> 11:49.578
than the vase.

11:49.665 --> 11:50.971
Uh-huh.

11:51.058 --> 11:54.235
And lastly, you should
chew the stem shavings.

11:54.322 --> 11:55.671
Good protein.

11:55.758 --> 11:58.108
Chew the stems.
Okay.

11:58.892 --> 11:59.849
Wait, what?

11:59.936 --> 12:02.504
Finally got
your attention.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.288
Sorry, I'm distracted.

12:04.375 --> 12:07.161
Do you want to
talk about it?

12:07.248 --> 12:09.119
It's just--

12:09.206 --> 12:11.252
Lever said all this
terrible stuff about my mom,

12:11.339 --> 12:12.775
and he doesn't even
know her.

12:12.862 --> 12:15.386
I can see how that
would be frustrating.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.432
But people talk.

12:17.519 --> 12:18.825
You can't let it
get to you.

12:31.533 --> 12:32.664
I'm hungry.

12:35.711 --> 12:36.843
Here.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.324
I'm sorry, Miss Silvers,
you know the rules.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.718
Only pre-packaged foods
until we know you're safe.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.676
Pass.

12:44.764 --> 12:45.721
Suit yourself.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.681
What are you
working on?

12:49.769 --> 12:51.509
My website.
For the food bike.

12:51.596 --> 12:52.859
Business has been slow.

12:52.946 --> 12:54.295
How's it going?

12:54.382 --> 12:56.776
[exhales]
Not great.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.256
All I have so far is
my tagline.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.519
"Tantalize your taste buds
with Jake's

13:01.606 --> 13:04.609
"sumptuous mobile delights."

13:04.696 --> 13:06.873
I just thought you
sold food on a bike.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.049
Did you bring
anything to do?

13:09.136 --> 13:13.096
No, actually,
I didn't know I'd be
holed up here all day.

13:13.183 --> 13:14.968
I think I'll run home
and grab a book.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.317
What? No way.

13:16.404 --> 13:18.188
If Kelly finds out,
she'll end me.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.973
Girl can be scary
when she wants to be.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.279
It's practically
across the street.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.760
I'll be there and back
in no time.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.458
Unless you'd prefer
to chitchat.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.596
Nope.

13:34.683 --> 13:38.339
Perhaps something more ornate
with carvings on it.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.471
[sighs] Oh.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.517
This is one of
my favorites.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.780
No, it had a knife,
fork and spoon on it.

13:44.867 --> 13:49.350
I mean, do you have something
with a knife, fork and spoon?

13:49.437 --> 13:51.395
That's very specific.

13:51.482 --> 13:53.441
Let me look.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.486
So, Grandma Becky.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.010
What have you
been up to lately?

13:57.097 --> 13:59.012
Specifically,
yesterday afternoon.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.056
Anything cool?

14:00.143 --> 14:03.146
Uh, nothing I recall.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.757
Oh! How about this one?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.891
It's a tad bigger than
what I'm looking for.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.850
I just want it
to be perfect.

14:13.026 --> 14:15.332
So it was just
a normal day at the shop?

14:15.419 --> 14:17.334
No, I didn't work yesterday.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.423
Interesting.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.034
Did you meet anyone?

14:21.121 --> 14:24.341
I'm sorry, Hannah,
why are you here?

14:24.428 --> 14:28.128
I'm here to help Miss Silvers
find a gift for a friend.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.086
Uh-huh.

14:34.264 --> 14:35.483
Okay.

14:35.570 --> 14:38.355
And when you first
meet someone,

14:38.442 --> 14:41.576
how do you greet them?

14:41.663 --> 14:44.622
Nicely done.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.276
How do you know
all this stuff?

14:46.363 --> 14:50.890
Well, I'll tell you.
Can you all keep a secret?

14:52.717 --> 14:55.024
I'm very old.

14:55.111 --> 14:56.852
[laughing]

14:56.939 --> 15:00.334
Now, who thinks
they could finish
setting the table?

15:03.772 --> 15:05.469
Your neighbor's so cool.

15:05.556 --> 15:06.906
Mine only bothers
to talk to me

15:06.993 --> 15:09.734
when she needs help
carrying groceries.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.649
Miss Silvers
is pretty awesome.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.914
Tell me if you see
anything suspicious.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.611
You mean like a
paranoid looking guy

15:16.698 --> 15:18.656
who's following
way too close to me?

15:18.743 --> 15:19.701
Where?

15:21.964 --> 15:23.835
Ah, very funny.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.059
- [sighs]
- You okay?

15:30.146 --> 15:31.843
I'm fine, Jake,
really,

15:31.931 --> 15:34.846
though I could use
one of those pretzels.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.587
That honey mustard dip
is my favorite.

15:36.674 --> 15:39.721
You know, that park stand
has been there over 20 years.

15:39.808 --> 15:42.767
No website,
no fancy taglines,

15:42.854 --> 15:45.770
just good old fashioned
soft pretzels.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.163
Wait. Is that
a slam on me?

15:47.250 --> 15:48.686
Yes.

15:48.773 --> 15:52.038
I'd support a kid
selling food on a bike,

15:52.125 --> 15:55.389
but I have no interest in
tantalizing my taste buds

15:55.476 --> 15:59.654
with anyone's sumptuous
mobile delights.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.830
Thanks, Miss Silvers.

16:01.917 --> 16:02.874
Let's get your book.

16:02.962 --> 16:03.919
Mm-hm.

16:09.707 --> 16:11.971
My garden.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.016
Everything's dead.

16:14.103 --> 16:17.063
- It's horrible, it's--
- Magic.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.673
Come on, we gotta
get out of here.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.208
Looks like you're getting
the hang of this.

16:32.295 --> 16:34.776
Thanks.
Not like the flowers are
gonna make a difference.

16:34.863 --> 16:38.345
Still upset about
what Lever said?

16:38.432 --> 16:43.002
Yeah. Who is he to
say stuff about my mom?

16:43.089 --> 16:45.352
Never mind.
You wouldn't get it.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.919
Actually,
I think I do get it.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.792
Probably better
than anyone.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.141
You don't remember
when people said

16:52.228 --> 16:54.100
I was a mean old witch.

16:55.710 --> 16:58.147
Kelly, listen.

16:58.234 --> 17:01.542
People say things.
Mean things.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.283
But if you listen to them,

17:03.370 --> 17:06.589
you'll drive yourself crazy.

17:06.676 --> 17:08.810
But why would Lever
say all that stuff?

17:08.896 --> 17:10.898
Maybe he's jealous.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.075
Maybe he's scared
he's gonna lose.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.858
But what he says
about your mom

17:14.945 --> 17:16.686
isn't a reflection
of her.

17:16.773 --> 17:19.429
It's a reflection
of him.

17:19.516 --> 17:22.388
Don't waste energy
trying to make sense of it.

17:25.740 --> 17:28.656
♪♪

17:33.269 --> 17:34.444
Look what I found.

17:34.531 --> 17:35.532
Is that it?

17:35.619 --> 17:37.317
How did you find it?

17:37.404 --> 17:40.102
I figured Becky
hid it in back
for safe keeping.

17:40.189 --> 17:43.062
I snuck back there when
another customer came in.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.064
Hannah:
I can't believe it.
This is so cool.

17:48.676 --> 17:51.200
Okay. Mix tape.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.334
Beeper.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.296
I don't get it.

18:00.383 --> 18:04.735
I'm sorry, Hannah.
but I told you.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.520
There's nothing here.

18:06.607 --> 18:10.480
It's too big a coincidence.
The box can't be random.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.482
[whispers]
Grandma mentioned it
in her voicemail.

18:12.569 --> 18:15.790
Well, she also said
the book is the key.

18:15.877 --> 18:17.661
I've been looking,
but... [sighs]

18:17.748 --> 18:18.706
nothing.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.189
Wait a minute.

18:25.234 --> 18:27.497
Miss Silvers.

18:27.584 --> 18:31.197
The book is the key.

18:31.284 --> 18:33.764
It's a book.

18:33.851 --> 18:34.809
You don't think...

18:34.896 --> 18:37.246
Oh, I definitely think.

18:41.772 --> 18:42.686
[lock clicks]

18:46.864 --> 18:49.519
Whoa. It's completely
different inside.

18:52.696 --> 18:55.003
I just still
can't believe it.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.874
The girls are right,
I am next.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.354
Maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

18:58.441 --> 18:59.877
The magic hasn't always
served you well.

18:59.964 --> 19:01.618
But if I forget it
completely,

19:01.705 --> 19:04.317
that means I'll forget
everything surrounding it.

19:04.404 --> 19:07.102
A huge part of my life
has been the magic.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.237
Hannah:
A single vanilla bean.

19:11.324 --> 19:12.325
It's gotta be magical.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.940
Gina:
The three protectors.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.942
There's something
on the back.

19:22.291 --> 19:25.294
Hannah:
"RJ, Noelle, Arthur."

19:26.426 --> 19:28.558
Who's Arthur?

19:35.435 --> 19:36.784
Today was the coolest.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.264
I now have a whole new
appreciation for

19:38.351 --> 19:39.700
the art of
slicing butter.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.919
I honestly never thought
I would--

19:47.273 --> 19:48.622
Perfect.

19:48.709 --> 19:51.102
And look, the buds
are starting to open.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.278
Thanks again for--

19:56.630 --> 19:58.849
Jake: Why would someone
destroy your garden?

19:58.936 --> 20:00.982
Wouldn't they want to keep
the magic for themselves?

20:01.069 --> 20:02.331
What are you saying?

20:02.418 --> 20:05.247
Do you mean magic in
a metaphorical sense?

20:05.334 --> 20:08.119
What? No,
I mean magic magic.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.121
[sighs] Honestly,
I can't keep up with

20:10.209 --> 20:11.993
all the slang these days.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.300
Anyway,
I gotta get going.

20:14.387 --> 20:16.867
Oh, no.
Not you, too.

20:16.954 --> 20:19.087
How did this happen?
I've been with you all day.

20:19.174 --> 20:22.177
Yes, and I'm not
quite sure why.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.526
I have a performance
tonight.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.098
Kelly:
How did this happen?

20:30.185 --> 20:32.579
We may have left the trailer
just to go to her house.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.842
- Who did she see?
- What did she eat?

20:34.929 --> 20:36.757
Nothing.
That's the weird part.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.585
But her garden
was destroyed.

20:38.672 --> 20:39.629
- What?
- What happened?
- Destroyed how?

20:39.716 --> 20:41.457
I have no idea.

20:41.544 --> 20:43.894
Miss Silvers was
trying to figure it out
when we got back here.

20:43.981 --> 20:46.245
We were talking about
the magic that could have
killed her garden

20:46.332 --> 20:48.943
when all of a sudden
she just forgot.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.553
So she was spelled
sometime between

20:50.640 --> 20:52.686
her getting back to
the trailer and us arriving.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.297
And she didn't talk to anyone
or eat anything.

20:55.384 --> 20:57.299
The magic must be
slow release.

20:57.386 --> 21:00.302
Which explains why
people are forgetting things
mid sentence.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.261
So it could have hit her
at any time.

21:04.915 --> 21:07.527
It's not your fault,
Jake.

21:07.614 --> 21:08.658
This might be helpful.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.185
I found it in the box.

21:17.754 --> 21:18.886
Who's Arthur?

21:18.973 --> 21:20.757
