What do you know?

01:07.510 --> 01:08.440
I'm relieved.

01:08.510 --> 01:10.240
Bart, my birthday's in two days.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.950
I'm gonna be eight years old.

01:12.020 --> 01:13.020
It's a big number--

01:13.090 --> 01:14.260
almost double digits.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.690
Enjoy it while you can.

Everything changes

Will you please let me pour my
little heart out?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.430
Sorry.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.670
This old-timer does
ramble on sometimes, don't he?

01:26.730 --> 01:29.670
I do so much for you
and yet you have disappointed me

01:29.740 --> 01:31.310

Okay.

01:31.370 --> 01:33.140
I've made things for you...

Okay, okay, okay!

02:18.120 --> 02:21.020
Bart, I asked you
to watch your sister.

02:21.090 --> 02:23.630
I tried to stop her,
but she overpowered me.

02:23.690 --> 02:25.890
Who stole my shirt?
Who stole my shirt?!

02:25.960 --> 02:26.960
I washed it.

Thank you, Marge.

Pink?!

02:29.930 --> 02:31.800
I can't wear
a pink shirt to work.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.320
Everybody wears white shirts.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.770
I'm not popular enough
to be different.

02:35.830 --> 02:37.600
Now Homer, don't panic,
you have plenty
of white shirts.

02:37.670 --> 02:39.110
Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme.

02:39.170 --> 02:40.810
Oh, no! Pink!

02:47.410 --> 02:49.340
I don't know how this
could've happened.

02:49.420 --> 02:51.020
Ah, my lucky red hat.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.610
Clean as a whistle.

02:52.690 --> 02:54.890
<i>You! You did this to me!</i>

02:54.950 --> 02:56.680
I... apologize.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.130
Oh please, no ones going
to notice

02:58.190 --> 03:00.130
if you wear
a pink shirt to work.

03:01.530 --> 03:03.630
Mr. Burns:
Wait a minute.

03:03.700 --> 03:05.370
Go back.

03:05.430 --> 03:06.970
Zoom in.

03:07.030 --> 03:09.290
Why is that man
in pink?!

03:09.370 --> 03:11.910
That's Homer Simpson, sir--
He's one of your boob's
from Sector 7-G.

03:11.970 --> 03:14.080
Simpson, eh?
Judging by his
outlandish attire

03:14.140 --> 03:17.080
he's some sort
of free-thinking anarchist.

03:17.140 --> 03:18.740
I'll call security, sir.

03:18.810 --> 03:20.010
Excellent.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.580
Yes, these color monitors

03:21.650 --> 03:23.720
have already paid
for themselves.

03:23.780 --> 03:26.410
Man:
Pink! I don't get
the statement.

03:27.620 --> 03:28.690
Shh.....

03:28.750 --> 03:29.480
Hey, Homer.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.990
we saved you a donut.

03:31.060 --> 03:32.960
It has <i>pink frosting.</i>

03:33.030 --> 03:34.100
( <i>laughter )</i>

03:34.160 --> 03:35.430
Thanks.

03:35.490 --> 03:36.620
It looks...

03:36.700 --> 03:38.070
Hey, wait a minute!

03:38.130 --> 03:40.070
Just because I'm wearing
a pink shirt

03:40.130 --> 03:43.400
doesn't mean I'm some kind
of a.. pink donut-eater.

03:43.470 --> 03:45.110
Although it is tempting.

03:45.170 --> 03:46.070
( <i>smacks lips )</i>

03:46.140 --> 03:47.210
Drop that donut.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.600
Let's go, pinky.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.010
You don't understand.

03:51.080 --> 03:54.950
My son just threw his red hat in
with the white laundry.

03:55.010 --> 03:57.640
Spare me the tiresome antics
of the Simpson family.

03:57.720 --> 03:58.950
Take him away.

03:59.020 --> 04:01.820
His body cavity search
revealed nothing.

04:01.890 --> 04:04.190
We must have X-rayed him
a hundred times.

04:04.260 --> 04:06.090
Maybe he's telling the truth.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.530
Or perhaps you two
are in cahoots.

04:07.590 --> 04:09.520
Smithers, I seem to recall
you had a penchant

04:09.600 --> 04:10.800
for bell-bottomed
trousers

04:10.860 --> 04:12.060
back in '79.

04:12.130 --> 04:14.640
That was my costume
for the plant production

04:14.700 --> 04:15.500

04:15.570 --> 04:16.870
Yes, of course.

04:16.940 --> 04:19.269
Your spirited hornpipe
stole the show, as I recall.

04:19.339 --> 04:21.040
Now doctor, what should we do

04:21.110 --> 04:22.640
about our
free-wheeling fop
over here?

04:22.710 --> 04:25.280
Well Monte, it used to be that
establishing a patient's sanity

04:25.340 --> 04:26.340
took months.

04:26.410 --> 04:27.150

and he can multiply them

08:49.780 --> 08:51.810

Okay. Five times nine.

Forty-five.

Wow!

08:55.580 --> 08:56.950
We call this guy 'The Chief.'

He's been here
since 1968.

Never says a word.
Never moves a muscle.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.560
Hey, Chief.

09:01.620 --> 09:03.290
Hello.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.530
It's about time
somebody reach out to me.

09:06.590 --> 09:09.660
Gee, I got to call my family.

09:11.260 --> 09:14.390
This is embarrassing
calling them from a nut house.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.940
They think I'm a God.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.240
I could call them for you.

09:17.300 --> 09:19.460
Oh, great. And uh,
try to put a good face on this.

09:19.540 --> 09:20.980

one of those places

09:27.950 --> 09:29.780
Bart Simpson.
Who the hell are you?

09:29.850 --> 09:30.990
I'm Michael Jackson.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.390
No way.

It's true. I'm with your
father in a mental institution.

09:35.790 --> 09:37.330
Uh-huh. And is Elvis with you?

09:37.390 --> 09:38.730
He could be.

Brooke Shields, Diana Ross,
Emmanuel Lewis and Bubbles.

Shiver me timbers!

09:48.530 --> 09:50.390
You <i>are Michael Jackson!</i>

09:50.470 --> 09:52.470
Can you stay on the line
while I'll get all
my friends and relatives?

09:52.540 --> 09:53.540
I'm afraid not, Bart.

09:53.610 --> 09:55.610
Your father really needs
your help.

09:55.670 --> 09:58.470
You don't want him
to get a lobotomy, do you?

09:58.540 --> 09:59.900
<i>Hmm... lobotomy.</i>

10:02.850 --> 10:06.020
That's all right, son.

10:06.080 --> 10:09.110
There's probably a downside
I don't see.

Your family will

There's only one way out of here
and it ain't pretty.

12:05.650 --> 12:07.280
The job was my life.

Then, one Monday morning, I got
up, I couldn't leave the house.

12:10.660 --> 12:11.330
I just couldn't.

12:11.390 --> 12:12.520
Was the door locked?

No. I just couldn't face

Was it raining?

No, Homer

Dave suffers

Please Dave, go on.

I just couldn't make
that long drive to work.

when my sisters' birthdays
rolled around?

17:44.790 --> 17:45.950
Stiffed them?

17:46.030 --> 17:49.170
No. I wrote them a song
to show that I cared.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.670
I can't write a song.
I'm only ten.

17:51.730 --> 17:54.800
Only ten? When I was your age
I had six gold records.

17:54.870 --> 17:58.510
Hey, Looney Tunes, this is
what Michael Jackson looks like.

17:58.570 --> 18:01.270
You look like
a big, fat mental patient.

18:01.340 --> 18:02.570
You'd be amazed how
often I hear that.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.200
Just leave me alone.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.120
Look boy, either Michael Jackson
is some guy working

18:06.180 --> 18:08.390
in a recording studio in L.A.

18:08.450 --> 18:10.620
or he's here with you
willing to work on this song.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.220
It's your choice.

18:12.290 --> 18:13.760
So long.

18:14.690 --> 18:16.290
Wait, wait, Michael!

18:16.360 --> 18:19.800
You go sit at the piano
and I'll boil some coffee.

Maybe that will help.

18:45.990 --> 18:48.590
Oh, she looks sad.
