00:48.600 --> 00:51.200
Yeah, Ruth. Did you hear it?

00:51.200 --> 00:53.600
I wrote the last bit.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.000
What sort of accident?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.800
Yeah, I know it.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.400
Yeah, I'll get over there now.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.000
<i>Stay back, please.</i>

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
You're gonna have to move your car.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.200
<i>Yeah, I'm Rhys Williams,
manager of Harwood's Haulage.</i>

01:17.800 --> 01:18.800
You can check on the vehicle later.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.200
Bollocks! I know the driver.
Is he...?

01:22.400 --> 01:25.200
<i>Didn't make it. Sorry.</i>

01:25.200 --> 01:27.000
Can you give me some details, sir?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.600
It's Leighton.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.400
Er... Leighton Reynolds.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.800
<i>- Next of kin?
- Yeah, he's got a wife.</i>

01:35.800 --> 01:38.400
Jen.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.600
Just had a baby, man.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.600
- Do you know the address?
- Yeah. 

01:41.800 --> 01:44.800
54 Keppoch Street, Roath.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.400
I give him a lift to football.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.400
Thank you, sir.

01:50.600 --> 01:54.600
Er, right. I'm gonna need to
arrange to move the lorry.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.200
Not yet. There's something
suspicious in the back.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.400
It's just meat.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.000
Leighton was taking it
to the abattoir.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.400
Yeah, well, whatever.
Torchwood want a look at it first.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.400
Argh, it stinks!

02:47.000 --> 02:49.800
No bones. Just dense flesh.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.400
It's not like any flesh
I've ever seen.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.600
What is it?

02:57.600 --> 03:01.800
Well, as there haven't been
any giant cow sightings,

03:01.800 --> 03:04.800
I suggest we take a sample
back to the Hub.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.000
We need to confiscate
the contents of the van 

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
till we've done
further investigations.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.200
Do you find out out
where it came from?

03:12.200 --> 03:13.800
No, but it's a Harwood's lorry
so they should...

03:13.800 --> 03:17.000
Oh, that's Rhys's firm.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.200
- Right, done.
- Let's go.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.600
Sorry, sir,
you can't come this way now.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.600
There's evidence
of a vertebral column

03:48.600 --> 03:51.800
but its genetic make-up isn't
compatible with any known animal.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.800
- Any idea what it is?
- I have to scan it.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.000
But whoever's farming this meat
knows it's dodgy. See this?

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Official vet stamp fit
for human consumption. It's fake.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.200
It's good, but it's fake.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.600
Tosh, get onto the haulage firm.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.800
Find out where the meat is from
and where it's heading.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.200
Why did it have to be Rhys's firm?

04:06.200 --> 04:07.600
It's too close to home.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.000
Want to stand down?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.800
No, I want to find out
what's going on.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.600
Thank you, Ianto.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.000
<i>o/~  Harwood's!</i>

04:15.000 --> 04:18.399
<i>o/~  You won't be sorry
with a Harwood's lorry!</i>

04:18.399 --> 04:19.200
Catchy.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.200
Do you think the haulage firm
are in on it? 

04:21.200 --> 04:22.600
Rhys? No.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.000
He just hires the vans out.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.800
- Driver must have seen it loaded.
- That doesn't implicate Rhys.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.000
He's the most honest man I know.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.200
Have you got his direct line?

04:41.600 --> 04:45.600
Harwood's Haulage.
How may I help you?

04:45.600 --> 04:47.400
It's the police.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.200
Hello?

04:53.200 --> 04:55.600
Yeah, speaking.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.600
Yes, I'm aware of the accident.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.600
<i>It's a firm is called
Harries and Harries.</i>

04:59.600 --> 05:02.000
<i>They came to us two months back.
It's a weekly contract.</i>

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
<i>- Are they licensed?</i>
- 0f course they're licensed!

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Could you give me their address?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.200
- There's no address here.
- There's a pick-up point.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.000
They said it was hard to find.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.200
<i>Hello, sorry. All I've got
is a service station on the A4-70,</i>

05:15.200 --> 05:16.800
15 miles from Cardiff.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.600
Do you have their contact number?

05:21.400 --> 05:24.600
No, there's no contact number, either.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.800
Can you tell me where
your driver took the meat?

05:26.800 --> 05:29.400
<i>Yes, he was taking it
to Caerwen Abattoir.</i>

05:29.400 --> 05:33.600
<i>It's a processing plant.</i>
Just general meat suppliers.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.800
What time did the driver
leave base?

05:36.800 --> 05:39.400
<i>Signed out at 10 to 1.</i>

05:39.400 --> 05:41.000
<i>Can I ask what this is about?</i>

05:41.000 --> 05:44.400
<i>I can't release that information, sir.
Thanks for your cooperation</i>

05:44.400 --> 05:46.400
Yeah, but I'm the manager...

05:46.800 --> 05:47.800
Brilliant!

05:47.800 --> 05:49.400
Leighton was their regular.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.000
Apart from that first booking,
they just went through him.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.400
Yes, but now it looks like
I'm hiding something, Ruth.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.100
Got him!

05:59.100 --> 06:01.300
There he is,
coming back 40 minutes later.

06:01.300 --> 06:04.100
Let's say it takes
20 minutes to load...

06:04.100 --> 06:07.100
<i>We are talking
a ten-mile radius.</i>

06:07.100 --> 06:09.100
- Jack!
- Yeah?

06:11.100 --> 06:14.100
The scan shows
it's definitely alien meat.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.300
Where would they get it from?

06:15.300 --> 06:17.100
If it's going into the processing plant

06:17.100 --> 06:20.700
that means it'll be going into pies,
burgers, pasties - everything.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.300
That means people have been
eating it for months.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.300
Well, the DNA traces are stable.

06:24.300 --> 06:28.900
There are signs of animal sedative
but no diseases or residues.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.500
My guess is it's good to eat.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
Would <i>you</i> eat it?

06:32.500 --> 06:33.700
Pizza's arrived.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.100
I presumed it would be a late one.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.500
- What did you get me?
- Usual. Meat Feast.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.900
Lovely.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.300
I've narrowed it down
to three potential areas.

06:43.300 --> 06:46.500
Only one warehouse is unoccupied,
just outside Merthyr.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.500
Makes sense.
Who knows what goes on there?

06:48.500 --> 06:50.300
We have to shut the operation down,

06:50.300 --> 06:53.900
neutralise whoever's doing this
and identify the alien meat.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.500
Tosh, you co-ordinate.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.300
I have to slip home
and check on Rhys.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.900
Good idea.
Find out how much he knows.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.500
That's not what I meant.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.900
Hiya!

07:13.900 --> 07:16.500
I got your message.
Are you all right?

07:16.500 --> 07:19.100
Er... bit of a tough day.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.500
Had an accident at work.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.500
One of our lorries crashed.

07:24.900 --> 07:28.500
- Anyone hurt?
- Leighton.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.900
One of my drivers died.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.100
Oh, no!

07:32.100 --> 07:34.700
Only 24.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.300
Were you close?

07:36.300 --> 07:38.100
For God's sake, Gwen,
you met him!

07:38.100 --> 07:41.300
Small, dark hair,
played five-a-side with me.

07:42.300 --> 07:45.100
Sorry. I can't place him.

07:45.100 --> 07:48.300
Well, then I hear that the, er...

07:49.100 --> 07:52.900
that the police have taken
the meat out the back of the van.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.100
You any idea why?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.300
How would I know?

07:57.900 --> 08:00.300
You work for them.

08:00.900 --> 08:05.700
I don't deal in traffic accidents, so...

08:07.100 --> 08:09.500
Well, they phoned the office and...

08:09.500 --> 08:12.500
they asked loads of questions.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.900
Thing is, all I do
is hire out the lorries, so I. ..

08:14.900 --> 08:17.700
Then there's nothing for you
to worry about, is there?

08:20.300 --> 08:22.100
Must be something dodgy going on,
though.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.500
If there was,
you weren't to know, were you?

08:24.500 --> 08:27.700
- No, of course not.
- No.

08:31.300 --> 08:34.299
I wish I didn't have to
go back to work now.

08:34.299 --> 08:36.900
Hardly worth you coming home.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.299
Yes, it was.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.500
To see you.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.100
I'm sorry.

08:50.100 --> 08:53.100
I'll see you later.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.900
Go and have a pint. Call Daf.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.300
Yeah.

08:59.300 --> 09:01.700
Yeah, maybe I will.

09:24.700 --> 09:25.900
<i>Like I thought.</i>

09:25.900 --> 09:28.500
<i>He has no idea what's going on.</i>

09:28.500 --> 09:31.900
Would you care to accompany me
to the slaughterhouse?

09:38.100 --> 09:40.100
Have you ever eaten alien meat?

09:40.100 --> 09:42.300
Yeah.

09:42.300 --> 09:43.500
What was it like?

09:43.500 --> 09:45.700
He seemed to enjoy it.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.300
<i>Ianto, Owen,
we're just on our way in.</i>

10:01.300 --> 10:03.900
<i>How are things looking at
the slaughterhouse? Are you in position?</i>

10:03.900 --> 10:07.100
<i>It's all quiet. There's a deserted
access road. We won't get noticed.</i>

10:07.100 --> 10:08.500
<i>I'll direct you in.</i>

10:12.900 --> 10:15.500
Ianto, nearly there.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.700
Take the second turning.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.300
<i>Park on the left.
No-one will see the car there.</i>

10:31.300 --> 10:34.100
There's a main entrance at the front.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.100
It's the only one open.
<i>The rest are padlocked and alarmed.</i>

10:48.300 --> 10:49.900
How many are in there?

10:49.900 --> 10:52.100
It's difficult to tell,
there are no windows.

10:52.100 --> 10:53.900
I have blueprints of the warehouse.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.300
<i>The stock
has to be in the central area.</i>

10:56.300 --> 10:58.100
Having fun?

10:58.100 --> 10:59.900
You don't know what you're missing.

11:01.100 --> 11:02.100
According to the sensor,

11:02.100 --> 11:04.900
<i>there's a heat signature
across the entire building.</i>

11:04.900 --> 11:06.700
That's a lot of meat.

11:14.300 --> 11:17.300
Answer the phone, Gwen!

11:17.300 --> 11:20.300
<i>You two take the sides,
Gwen and I will go in the front.</i>

11:20.300 --> 11:22.700
We don't want any casualties.

11:22.800 --> 11:26.600
We stun-gun whoever's in there
and put a stop to what they're doing.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.000
Let's go.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.200
There's someone there.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.600
It's Rhys.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.800
It's Rh... what's he doing?

11:48.800 --> 11:51.400
Did you bring the alarm de-activator?

11:53.200 --> 11:55.400
Well, that's one way of doing it.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.000
He must be in on it.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.600
Don't bother running, mate.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.800
Never. No.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.200
Greg?
We've got a bit of a problem, bruv.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.600
How else do you explain that?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.200
Ianto, Owen...

12:16.200 --> 12:19.000
<i>Stand down.
Repeat, stand down.</i>

12:20.200 --> 12:22.400
He told me he didn't know
what was going on.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.800
He wouldn't lie to me.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.200
He also said he didn't know
where they were based.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.000
But he did.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.400
There's something wrong.
There has to be.  

12:28.400 --> 12:31.200
Gwen! No. No!

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
No!

12:35.000 --> 12:37.200
Come with me.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.800
- I just have to get him out.
- By charging in there? 

12:40.400 --> 12:41.600
What then?

12:41.600 --> 12:43.400
You gonna knock him out?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.200
Look, lads...

12:48.200 --> 12:51.600
I don't mean any harm, honestly.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.800
You can't just go in there.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.600
You have to do as I say.

13:02.200 --> 13:06.000
We wait until he comes out.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.200
Boys, you should've waited for
the ketamine injection before doing that.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.200
What about the hoses?

13:19.200 --> 13:21.400
That's lidocaine.
It's not strong enough.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.800
If you care so much,
go and work for the RSPCA.

13:23.800 --> 13:27.800
- Or don't they pay as good?
- Oi, you. Through here.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.600
Shift!

13:33.800 --> 13:37.600
I want you
and one of those with me, now!

13:40.000 --> 13:42.600
- Who sent you?
- Come on. Don't waste our time.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.400
No-one sent me.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.600
I came on my own.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.200
- I'm looking for the boss.
- You're looking at him.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.000
Ignore my little brother.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.600
I'm, er...

13:53.600 --> 13:56.600
I'm from Harwood's.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.000
Harwood's Haulage.

13:59.200 --> 14:03.800
Leighton... Er, Leighton,
your driver... he, um...

14:04.800 --> 14:06.000
He sort of told me
what was going on, like.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.600
Mouthy git!
He was paid to keep quiet. Ssh!

14:09.200 --> 14:11.200
Yeah, well, he's dead.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
- Lorry crashed.
- With the goods inside?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.400
What happened to the meat?
Did anyone see the meat?

14:15.600 --> 14:17.200
No, no, no.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.800
I... er...
I picked it all up and   

14:20.800 --> 14:24.200
took it all to be incinerated.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.200
You see, um...

14:27.200 --> 14:29.600
I was hoping maybe I could

14:29.600 --> 14:33.000
pick up from
where he left off, boys.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.200
How do we know
you won't report us?

14:38.200 --> 14:40.400
I'm here, aren't I?

14:41.400 --> 14:44.800
So what exactly did he tell you?

14:47.400 --> 14:49.000
Everything.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.400
You know, that you were...

14:51.400 --> 14:54.200
cleaning up old meat.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.400
Oh, it's a lot bigger than that.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.000
What's that noise?

15:44.200 --> 15:46.200
What is it, boys?

15:47.200 --> 15:48.800
No idea.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.800
<i>But the beauty of it is,</i>

15:57.800 --> 16:00.600
<i>it just keeps growing.</i>

16:00.600 --> 16:02.800
<i>No matter how much we cut it.</i>

16:22.600 --> 16:24.000
He'll get used to it.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.400
I don't get it.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.000
Come on.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.800
Let's go.

16:58.300 --> 17:00.100
- What were you doing at that warehouse?  
- You lied to me!

17:00.100 --> 17:01.300
You were at the crash.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.900
- What are you talking about?
- Stop pissing me around,Gwen!

17:03.900 --> 17:05.700
You're so used to lying
and fobbing me off 

17:05.700 --> 17:07.300
like the idiot I obviously am!

17:07.300 --> 17:08.500
Those blokes paying you?
Why you were there?

17:08.500 --> 17:11.300
No. I'm asking the questions,
all right!

17:12.099 --> 17:14.099
I followed you, okay?

17:14.700 --> 17:16.700
Yeah.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.700
So that bloke,
the tall bloke in the coat.

17:18.700 --> 17:20.700
You fucking him or what?

17:20.700 --> 17:22.300
All I ever asked was you trust me.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.099
What? Like you trust me?

17:24.099 --> 17:25.500
It's a two-way street, Gwen!

17:25.500 --> 17:26.500
There's stuff
you don't understand, Rhyes.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.900
Oh, of course not. I'm just
a big, dumb animal, aren't I?

17:28.900 --> 17:31.900
I mean, what's so secret
you can't even tell your own fiance?

17:31.900 --> 17:33.500
Why <i>are</i> you marrying me, Gweny?

17:33.500 --> 17:35.500
- What am I, a habit you can't be arsed to break?
- No.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.300
- Then tell the truth!
- No. All right!

17:37.300 --> 17:39.300
All right. My job...

17:39.300 --> 17:41.100
the special ops thing...

17:41.100 --> 17:42.500
it's a lie - a cover story.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.300
Thank you! At last!

17:44.300 --> 17:45.900
God, what's that taken?
About a year? 

17:45.900 --> 17:48.300
That's one lie down.
How many more?

17:48.300 --> 17:50.300
Is there anything in your life
based on truth?

17:50.300 --> 17:52.900
- Us.
- Us?!

17:52.900 --> 17:53.900
Us?

17:53.900 --> 17:56.100
Us is crumbling, Gwen!
Us is falling to shit!

17:56.300 --> 17:58.500
You think I enjoy
keeping this stuff to myself?

17:58.500 --> 17:59.500
Then why did you?

17:59.500 --> 18:02.100
Because I'm trying to protect you!

18:02.100 --> 18:04.700
Have you ever stopped
to think about that? No!

18:04.700 --> 18:08.900
No. Because you prefer to blunder in
without thinking or looking.

18:08.900 --> 18:11.700
Good old ham-fisted Rhys.
His heart is in the right place but  

18:11.900 --> 18:13.500
but his brain is
a million miles fucking back.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.900
Come on, let's have it all.
What exactly do I need protecting from?

18:16.900 --> 18:19.900
I catch aliens.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.700
- Piss off!
- You piss off...

18:22.700 --> 18:23.900
If you won't take it seriously...

18:23.900 --> 18:25.100
This is why I couldn't tell you.

18:25.100 --> 18:28.500
I hunt aliens and I scavenge
the stuff they leave behind.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.300
- Sometimes I don't believe it.
- Jesus Christ!

18:30.300 --> 18:32.700
What's getting into you?
Have you been brainwashed?

18:32.700 --> 18:35.900
Is that what's happened?
Cos you are talking high-grade shit here.

18:35.900 --> 18:40.100
Every word is the truth.

18:42.100 --> 18:45.100
Rhys...

18:45.100 --> 18:48.500
The things I have seen...

18:55.500 --> 18:58.500
The times I have wanted to tell you...

19:06.900 --> 19:09.700
Aliens?

19:09.700 --> 19:11.500
In Cardiff?

19:11.500 --> 19:17.700
Have you never seen something so mad,
so... extraordinary...

19:19.100 --> 19:23.500
..that, just for one second,
you think there might be more out there?

19:24.300 --> 19:25.700
Prove it.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.700
Well, this is unprecedented -

19:34.700 --> 19:36.300
the fiance finding out.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.300
Mainly because we're
all sad and single. 

19:38.300 --> 19:39.900
Speak for yourself.

19:39.900 --> 19:43.700
I am better off
without all that kind of hassle.

19:43.700 --> 19:47.300
Maybe the answer is to go out
with someone who knows what you do.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.300
Look around you, Tosh.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.500
Only we know what we do.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.900
I saw you here earlier.

20:00.900 --> 20:01.900
With him -  

20:01.900 --> 20:03.100
that bloke.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.500
He appeared out of nowhere.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.300
It's an invisible lift.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.500
Oh, it's too complicated to explain.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.100
Come on. Trust me.

20:14.100 --> 20:17.700
- Ready?
- Yeah.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.900
Who'd have thought this was here?

20:36.900 --> 20:39.700
- That looked so real.
- It was real.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.300
- They're extinct, Gwen.
- No, boy.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.900
In your time line, yes.

20:46.900 --> 20:47.700
Captain Jack Harkness.

20:47.700 --> 20:49.700
Thanks for dropping in, Rhys.

20:49.700 --> 20:51.100
This is the rest of the team.

20:51.100 --> 20:54.100
Owen and Toshiko. Ianto.

20:54.100 --> 20:56.100
Pleased to meet you.

20:56.100 --> 20:58.500
Welcome to our headquarters.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.900
It's a bit bigger than mine.

21:04.300 --> 21:06.300
So, Gwen tells me you catch aliens.

21:06.300 --> 21:07.100
That's right.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.300
A rift through space and time
that runs through Cardiff, Rhys.

21:09.300 --> 21:12.100
And stuff slips in from
other time lines and planets.

21:12.100 --> 21:15.100
It's our job to monitor it.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.900
Are you sure they're not
some kind of weird cult?

21:16.900 --> 21:18.500
You saw that alien in the warehouse.  

21:18.500 --> 21:20.100
Come on.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.700
What did you see? 

21:22.700 --> 21:25.700
It was this huge, shapeless beast,
filling the space.

21:25.700 --> 21:26.900
Like a mound of flesh.

21:26.900 --> 21:30.100
So it's one massive entity
as opposed to several organisms.

21:30.100 --> 21:33.300
The tests reveal high levels of chloride,
so it probably lives in the water.

21:33.300 --> 21:36.500
I reckon it came through the rift,
into the sea and beached itself.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.100
Like a giant alien manatee.

21:38.100 --> 21:39.500
But how did they get it there?

21:39.500 --> 21:41.700
That warehouse must be
50 metres long.

21:42.700 --> 21:46.300
Maybe it was smaller when they
found it. They said it's growing.

21:46.900 --> 21:47.700
It's not dead?

21:47.700 --> 21:50.700
No. It's breathing. Its eye opened.

21:50.700 --> 21:53.500
So the protein chains regenerate
despite the mutilation.

21:53.700 --> 21:55.900
Not only is it
replenishing its own flesh 

21:55.900 --> 21:58.700
but it's increasing it,
giving them a brand-new meat supply.

21:58.700 --> 22:00.100
It will last for years.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.500
If we knew how it worked,
we could feed the world.

22:02.500 --> 22:03.500
We could release a single.

22:03.500 --> 22:07.100
Before we get ahead of ourselves, we're
talking about dodgy pies in Merthyr, okay?

22:07.100 --> 22:09.300
And the fact that
they're cutting it up alive,

22:09.300 --> 22:11.700
which we could have put a stop to
if it wasn't for you.

22:11.700 --> 22:12.900
I thought my fiancee was in danger.

22:12.900 --> 22:15.300
Well, Mr. Caveman, she wasn't.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.300
- She can handle herself.
- Jack...

22:17.300 --> 22:19.700
All you did tonight
was mess things up.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.800
Now we have to think of a way
to get back in and, 

22:21.800 --> 22:24.000
thanks to you,
they'll have tightened security.

22:24.200 --> 22:27.200
Well, what if you stopped
and asked me what I saw in there, 

22:27.200 --> 22:28.800
instead of showing off
around the place...

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
- Do I show off?
- Just a bit.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.800
..you'd know I got out by saying
I wanted a job as a delivery boy.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.600
So rather than cock things up,
I've found you a way to get in.

22:36.800 --> 22:40.200
But if you can't handle that, big boy,
then you can stuff it!

22:40.200 --> 22:44.200
- This is quite homo-erotic.
- No, no, no. Jack, he is not getting us in.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.800
Team meeting. You, too.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.600
Jack!

22:53.400 --> 22:55.000
That's where the thing is.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.400
That's the sedatives room.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.000
That's where they hang
and pack all the meat.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.400
- That's good to know.
- Yeah, that is good to know.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.800
But he's not driving us in.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.000
They're expecting me.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
You lot can hide
in the back of the van.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.600
What is this? Scooby-Doo?!

23:04.600 --> 23:06.800
Absolutely no way
is he getting involved.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.600
When it was you to decided to get
involved, did you give me a thought?

23:09.600 --> 23:10.600
Oh, joy a domestic. 

23:10.600 --> 23:13.200
<i>Rhys is right.
He is our best way in. Stun guns only.</i>

23:13.200 --> 23:16.200
We've handled bigger than this. Why don't we
storm in, guns in the air, and arrest them?

23:16.200 --> 23:17.800
Those men aren't organised criminals.

23:17.800 --> 23:21.000
If we go in, guns blazing,
they'll kill the evidence and run.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I wasn't suggesting blazing,
just waving.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
The last thing we need is a bloodbath. 

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
- Point taken.
- I know that...

23:26.000 --> 23:29.400
Once Rhys has loaded up,
he can clear.

23:29.400 --> 23:32.000
You don't have to come.
You can stand down.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
- It might be better.
- You love him.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.200
Makes you vulnerable.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.000
He's not going in there without me.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.400
- That's your decision.
- Yes, it is.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.000
You both have to live by it.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.200
Come on. You and me - a team!

23:51.200 --> 23:53.200
Damn it, Rhys!

23:54.600 --> 23:57.200
This is for real.
Do you understand?

23:57.200 --> 23:58.400
This is for real!

23:58.400 --> 24:01.600
And if you mess up,
I will kill you!

24:03.200 --> 24:08.200
So...after we've stun-gunned the workers,
we put the creature out of its misery.

24:08.200 --> 24:11.800
No. We're gonna save it.

24:11.800 --> 24:15.000
Stabilise it,
wait for the rift to open and...

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
send it back.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.600
Guess who'll have to
look after it in the meantime.

24:17.600 --> 24:21.600
Tell me how are we going to use it
to arm ourselves against the future?

24:21.600 --> 24:22.400
Hide behind it.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.000
Why shouldn't we save it?

24:24.000 --> 24:25.200
Because it's an alien?

24:25.200 --> 24:26.400
It needs our protection.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.400
You didn't hear its cry.
Heart-breaking.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.200
Listen to Ahab.

24:31.200 --> 24:34.800
- Jack, it's growing.
- Well, we'll find a way to stop it mutating.

24:34.800 --> 24:38.800
We are doing this. That's an order!

24:38.800 --> 24:43.800
- Fine.
- I'll stock up on plankton.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.600
So you do have a heart.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.200
We see enough death.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.200
<i>What's that?</i>

25:04.200 --> 25:07.000
Oh, it's just an idea
of what it looks like.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.800
I had it made up from
the genetic make-up.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.800
It looks lovely.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
You're just a big softie,
really, aren't you?

25:15.000 --> 25:18.600
I'd better get on with that report.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.000
I brought you some sandwiches.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
- Thanks, Tosh.
- It's okay, just cheese and pickle.

25:25.800 --> 25:29.000
I can keep you company.
I'm not tired.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
In that case, maybe you can do it.
I'm knackered.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.400
That's another big lump
out of its habitat.

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
Makes you realise, maybe it is possible
to do this job and have a relationship.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.200
Do you fancy a game of pool sometime?

25:52.200 --> 25:55.200
We're always in here, slaving away.

25:55.200 --> 25:58.600
It might be nice to, I don't know,
kick back and have some fun.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.200
Yeah, why not?

26:00.200 --> 26:02.400
- When?  
- I'll check with the others.

26:02.400 --> 26:05.800
We could have a Torchwood tournament.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.200
Thanks for the sandwiches, Tosh.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.200
I thought you were anti-terrorism.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.800
That was bad enough, but knowing
you're in this much danger...

26:16.800 --> 26:19.400
Yeah, you'd feel like I do now.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.600
Worried sick.

26:23.600 --> 26:27.800
You don't have to do this
to prove anything to me.

26:28.600 --> 26:31.600
I'm not leaving you
with all these sexy young men.

26:31.600 --> 26:34.400
There's only one
from where I'm sitting.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.000
- Sure about this?
- Yeah.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.600
Cos once they ring,
there's no turning back.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
<i>Morning!</i>

26:56.200 --> 26:58.400
<i>- You just missed the advert.</i>
- Yeah?

26:58.400 --> 27:01.000
Just popped in for my jacket
and to sign for a van.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.800
Here's your tea. And I got you
a Danish, your favourite.

27:03.800 --> 27:05.800
I'm in the wrong job.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.600
We have got job vacancies.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.600
Maybe you could fit me in.

27:09.600 --> 27:10.800
I'd be delighted to.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.200
Would I need a licence for trucking?

27:12.200 --> 27:15.800
Yes. Takes four weeks,
and then you can go long distance.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.400
That wouldn't be a problem.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
It's them.

27:25.200 --> 27:29.000
Okay... Yeah, hello?

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Why her? Of all the women
you could have chosen... 

27:31.000 --> 27:33.400
She chose us.

27:33.400 --> 27:35.800
- Kinda stumbled upon us.
- So did I.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.400
Doubt you'll be asking me to join.

27:37.400 --> 27:41.200
We needed someone with police skills.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.400
Could have chosen anyone.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.600
Did you ever think about us?

27:43.600 --> 27:47.600
You know, me, her parents,
people who love her, who want her safe?

27:47.700 --> 27:51.100
No, I'm sorry. We needed her.

27:52.900 --> 27:55.500
On her first day of work,

27:55.500 --> 27:57.700
she told me off for being too clinical.

27:57.700 --> 27:59.100
She doesn't hold back, mind.

27:59.100 --> 28:01.900
- Stubborn as hell.
- Tell me about it.

28:01.900 --> 28:03.300
Yeah, she's an amazing girl.

28:03.300 --> 28:04.500
I'm a lucky man, Jack.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.900
Yeah, you said it.

28:05.900 --> 28:08.500
I just wish you were a bit uglier.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.900
Not gay, by any chance, are you?

28:18.300 --> 28:20.100
Brought you a Danish,
your favourite.

28:20.100 --> 28:23.100
I know what you're like
on an empty stomach.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.300
Cheers.

28:30.500 --> 28:34.100
- Get out as soon as you can, remember?
- Yes, yes, yes.

28:39.100 --> 28:41.900
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

28:42.700 --> 28:46.700
Now, stop fussing,
and get in the back of the van.

29:17.500 --> 29:19.900
I'll prepare a ketamine antidote
so we can start weaning it off.

29:20.100 --> 29:22.700
Gwen, Tosh and I
will take the main area.

29:22.700 --> 29:26.900
Owen, Ianto, cover the corridors
and the small rooms. You okay?

29:26.900 --> 29:29.500
- What do you think?
- He'll be fine.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.500
He's a good bloke.

29:32.100 --> 29:33.100
Let's go.

29:37.900 --> 29:39.700
Yeah. I just need your boss
to sign this, mate.

29:39.700 --> 29:42.300
 I don't want any questions asked.

29:50.300 --> 29:52.900
You couldn't get us a cup of tea,
could you?

29:52.900 --> 29:54.900
Yes.

30:13.100 --> 30:16.500
Where do you want my autograph?

30:21.300 --> 30:22.900
Er... just on there, mate.

30:22.900 --> 30:25.500
Here's a oner for your trouble.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.500
Count it, if you like.

30:27.500 --> 30:29.900
No, it's fine, mate. I trust you.

30:29.900 --> 30:32.300
When you get to the abattoir,
ask for Graham.

30:32.300 --> 30:34.100
Him and the boys clean it up
and process it.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.500
 All right.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.700
Oh, my God!

31:12.900 --> 31:14.900
It's amazing!

31:16.300 --> 31:18.900
How did it get here?

32:30.100 --> 32:33.300
Imprisoned, chained and drugged.

32:33.300 --> 32:35.700
Welcome to planet Earth.

32:42.100 --> 32:43.900
It heard you.

32:43.900 --> 32:46.500
It's sentient.

32:57.900 --> 32:59.300
Jack.

33:09.300 --> 33:11.100
Oh, that's disgusting.

33:19.400 --> 33:22.600
What have they done to you?

33:28.600 --> 33:32.200
What have they done to you,
my poor friend?

34:19.800 --> 34:22.800
Everyone... they're armed.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.600
Rhys.

34:26.600 --> 34:27.800
Gwen.  

34:27.800 --> 34:29.800
Stay here.

34:37.400 --> 34:40.600
Where have you been?
That injection was due ten minutes ago.

34:40.600 --> 34:43.000
I needed more ketamine.
I've had to up the dose.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
The thing's in agony.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.800
It's meat. It can't feel anything.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.400
You going soft, or what?

34:48.400 --> 34:50.400
Get inside and play nurse,
if you're so bothered. 

34:50.400 --> 34:52.600
We've got work to do.

34:52.600 --> 34:55.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.200
There's only 12 bags in here.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.400
He's supposed to have three more.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.600
Come on, hurry up!

35:11.600 --> 35:16.600
Hello. I have a... thingy here
somewhere... hell of a day.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.800
I should be getting off, mate.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.200
I've got jobs backing up, you see?

35:22.200 --> 35:25.200
Well, they'll have to wait.

35:26.200 --> 35:30.400
<i>Dale, we've got a problem.
There are people in the building.</i>

35:32.200 --> 35:33.200
You want to answer me?!

35:33.200 --> 35:36.000
- Ianto, did Rhys get away?
- I'll check now.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.000
Hey, hey, hey! 

35:49.000 --> 35:53.200
You looking for someone?
How many more of you?!

35:53.600 --> 35:55.400
Just us.

35:55.400 --> 35:58.000
You thought the two of you
could take us out?

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
Nah, you're not that stupid.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.200
Dave, get some ropes,
tie their hands.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.400
I want every door locked,
inside and out.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.800
Nobody leaves the building
till this is sorted.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.600
- Move it!
- They've got Rhys and Ianto.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.800
Gwen!

36:16.200 --> 36:18.600
Gwen. Listen.
Hey! It will be okay.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.200
- Locked.
- They must know we're here.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.800
This way.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.200
What is it?

36:38.000 --> 36:39.800
The lads call it the <i>Cash Cow</i>.

36:39.800 --> 36:40.800
Dale, what are you doing?

36:40.800 --> 36:43.200
They couldn't bear to see us
making money.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.000
Fancied some for yourselves, eh?

36:45.000 --> 36:47.400
Thought we'd be a pushover?

36:47.400 --> 36:49.200
Mate, you're so out of your depth.

36:49.200 --> 36:52.600
Funny, I was just thinking
the same about you.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.200
Dale, don't be an idiot!

36:54.200 --> 36:56.200
Show yourselves or I shoot
the delivery boy!

36:56.400 --> 36:58.000
Okay!

37:00.800 --> 37:03.400
There's no need to make any threats.

37:03.400 --> 37:06.000
Just the two of you, is it?

37:07.800 --> 37:09.000
Gun down. Kick it over here.  

37:09.000 --> 37:11.200
- I don't have a gun.
- He had one, so you must have!

37:11.200 --> 37:13.600
Okay! Okay.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.600
Any more of you?

37:20.600 --> 37:23.800
And before you answer,
have a proper think,

37:23.800 --> 37:28.200
cos if you lie,
I will shoot you.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.400
It's just me.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Get against the drum.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.600
We can help you, Dale.

37:41.600 --> 37:45.000
Yeah, help yourselves, more like.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.600
Stand next to her. You, too!

37:46.600 --> 37:49.400
<i>Dale! Two more.
Far corner.<i></i></i>

37:49.400 --> 37:51.400
<i>They can't get out.
It's locked.</i>

37:52.200 --> 37:55.400
Kick out your weapons,
stand where I can see you!

37:56.800 --> 37:59.200
Drop your weapons!

38:02.000 --> 38:03.200
Do you know
what you've got here, Dale?

38:03.200 --> 38:05.600
- Shut up now!
- It's an alien.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.600
A creature from another galaxy.

38:07.600 --> 38:10.400
It came through a rift
in time and space,  

38:10.400 --> 38:12.600
and it was unlucky enough
to find you.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.000
<i>No. No way.</i>

38:14.000 --> 38:16.400
Did you really think
it originated on this planet?

38:16.400 --> 38:18.200
Have you ever seen anything
like it before?

38:18.200 --> 38:21.000
It can't be. Can it?

38:21.000 --> 38:22.800
Look at it.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.600
<i>Look at it.</i>

38:32.400 --> 38:36.400
- It's just meat, that's all.
<i>- You're carving up a sentient creature,</i>

38:36.400 --> 38:39.400
<i>- and you've got to stop!</i>
- And then what have I got?

38:39.400 --> 38:43.000
I'm making money here!
This is my business.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.200
For the first time in my life,
I've actually got something for myself!

38:46.300 --> 38:50.300
Dale, stop. You can still
walk away from this.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.300
No.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.900
You lied to me.

38:58.900 --> 39:00.300
No!

39:01.900 --> 39:03.100
No!

39:35.100 --> 39:35.900
Die!

39:36.900 --> 39:38.100
Shit!

39:40.100 --> 39:43.100
Ianto! Go! After them!

39:43.100 --> 39:45.700
Owen! Rhys has been shot!

39:45.700 --> 39:48.100
The creature's coming loose.
We need that sedative now!

39:48.100 --> 39:50.500
Open your eyes. Come on. You can do this.
Open your eyes now. Okay?

39:50.500 --> 39:53.300
Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it.

39:55.300 --> 39:56.300
Owen, we need you!

39:56.300 --> 40:00.500
<i>The creature's breaking free.
If we try and get past, we'll be crushed.</i>

40:01.100 --> 40:02.100
Come on.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.300
It wasn't me!

40:03.300 --> 40:05.700
I never wanted to be a part of this!

40:05.700 --> 40:07.500
Sedatives won't work now.

40:07.500 --> 40:10.300
If it's got loose,
you're never gonna stop it!

40:11.700 --> 40:13.900
We've gotta help them.

40:13.900 --> 40:15.900
It's out of control.

40:15.900 --> 40:17.700
Change of plan.

40:19.900 --> 40:21.500
You went and shot him, bruv.

40:21.500 --> 40:24.900
Come on! Go, go!
Fill the other one.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.300
<i>I'm going as fast as I can.</i>

40:33.500 --> 40:35.700
Pray they survive.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.900
Bloody hell!

40:54.100 --> 40:55.300
I'm sorry.

41:01.700 --> 41:03.300
He's okay.

41:04.100 --> 41:06.900
<i>Owen, you're making it worse!</i>

41:39.700 --> 41:41.900
Open your eyes!

41:43.100 --> 41:45.100
You can do it. Come on.

41:45.300 --> 41:49.500
It's working. Yeah, it's working.

41:50.300 --> 41:52.300
What did you do?

41:52.300 --> 41:53.900
Mercy killing.

41:56.100 --> 42:00.100
<i>Rhys, Rhys, listen to me,
listen to me.</i>

42:00.900 --> 42:03.100
That's it, stay with me, okay?

42:03.100 --> 42:04.500
I've got you tight.

42:04.500 --> 42:07.100
<i>Keep your eyes nice and open.</i>

42:10.700 --> 42:12.500
Gwen, let me look at him.

42:12.500 --> 42:14.100
Okay.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.100
Soft, soft, soft.

42:18.100 --> 42:20.100
Okay, now.

42:20.100 --> 42:23.100
I'm going to rip this.
<i>I want you to keep the pressure on, okay?</i>

42:24.100 --> 42:25.300
<i>okay.</i>

42:37.500 --> 42:41.300
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

43:16.100 --> 43:17.500
There he is.

43:20.700 --> 43:22.500
Hero of the hour.

43:22.700 --> 43:24.700
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:26.100 --> 43:28.100
Are you all right?

43:28.100 --> 43:30.300
I am now you are, yeah.

43:32.300 --> 43:33.300
Sorry.

43:33.300 --> 43:36.500
Next time,
let her take the bullet.

43:37.300 --> 43:38.700
Never.

43:39.500 --> 43:41.100
What happened to the blokes?

43:41.100 --> 43:42.500
<i>We gave them amnesia pills.</i>

43:42.500 --> 43:45.900
They'll remember who they are but not
what they did over the past few months.

43:45.900 --> 43:47.100
So they got away with it?

43:47.100 --> 43:49.100
It would never stand up
in court of law.

43:49.100 --> 43:51.700
And the creature?

43:58.700 --> 44:00.900
Incinerated.

44:05.500 --> 44:08.300
So there's nothing left.

44:09.300 --> 44:10.900
It was never there.

44:10.900 --> 44:13.700
Gwen, I need a word.

44:18.200 --> 44:20.000
<i>Sure.</i>

44:24.000 --> 44:26.800
Rhys has to forget too, you know?

44:29.400 --> 44:32.800
At least let me give it to him
at home.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.600
Let's not go home just yet.

45:05.600 --> 45:08.400
Rhys, you've just been shot.

45:08.400 --> 45:09.400
I know.

45:09.400 --> 45:11.400
Come on,

45:11.400 --> 45:13.400
let's go for an ice cream.

45:20.600 --> 45:23.000
Look around us.

45:24.200 --> 45:27.800
Nobody else knows
what we've been through.

45:27.800 --> 45:29.600
Or what else is out there.

45:29.600 --> 45:33.200
The sky won't be
the same to me anymore.

45:33.200 --> 45:35.200
I used to look up and think, 

45:35.200 --> 45:37.600
ah, looks like rain, man.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.000
But now,  

45:39.000 --> 45:40.600
oh, now I'll...

45:40.600 --> 45:44.200
I'll look and I'll think of
all the other worlds and the planets

45:44.200 --> 45:48.000
and stuff spinning around out there.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.400
And I got to be a part of it all!

45:50.400 --> 45:52.000
Fantastic!

45:52.000 --> 45:55.200
Which puts worrying about unsigned
dockets into perspective, I can tell you.

45:55.200 --> 45:57.600
You've got some ice cream on your chin.

45:57.600 --> 45:59.800
Have I? Gone?

46:00.600 --> 46:05.600
I want to know about all of it,
about every alien you've ever seen.

46:06.800 --> 46:08.000
You could take photos.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.600
I'll keep a scrap book.

46:10.600 --> 46:12.000
Wouldn't show no-one, no way.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
No, because you won't be keeping one. 

46:14.000 --> 46:15.400
And you know...

46:16.600 --> 46:17.600
I'm even cool about Jack.

46:17.800 --> 46:22.400
All right, he's handsome, enigmatic,
saves the world and all that.

46:22.400 --> 46:25.800
But it's me you come home to
at the end of it all.

46:26.600 --> 46:29.400
And I always will.

46:33.200 --> 46:36.000
Hey. Daf! All right?

46:38.400 --> 46:40.600
Oh, nothing much.

46:40.600 --> 46:43.000
Same old, same old.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.400
Yeah!

46:45.400 --> 46:47.000
What?

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
<i>No way!</i>

47:12.000 --> 47:13.200
I'm not doing it.

47:13.200 --> 47:14.800
- I won't drug him.
- You have to.

47:14.800 --> 47:16.600
You can't allow him to remember.

47:16.600 --> 47:17.600
It's the rules.

47:17.600 --> 47:19.400
But none of you have any
partners outside of this.

47:19.400 --> 47:20.600
But we understand how you feel.

47:20.600 --> 47:23.000
No, you don't.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
No, you don't, Jack!

47:25.000 --> 47:26.800
You all think it's cold
and lonely out there.

47:26.800 --> 47:29.600
But it isn't for me
because I have him. He matters.

47:29.600 --> 47:32.200
And I've lied to him
for long enough.

47:32.200 --> 47:35.400
What he did today
was so brave, 

47:35.400 --> 47:36.600
braver than any of us   

47:36.600 --> 47:38.600
because we signed up for this.
But he didn't!

47:38.600 --> 47:40.400
He did it because he loves me, 

47:40.400 --> 47:43.000
and I won't take that
away from him!

47:43.000 --> 47:44.800
I won't!

47:44.800 --> 47:47.400
And if that means
I have to quit 

47:47.400 --> 47:50.200
or you retcon me or whatever,
then fine,

47:50.200 --> 47:52.200
fine.

47:55.200 --> 47:59.200
You really think you could go back
to your old life before Torchwood?

48:00.400 --> 48:02.000
I wouldn't know anything different.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.200
I would.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.600
Give Rhys my love,
and I will see you tomorrow.

49:12.600 --> 49:14.000
<i>If he comes after me again,
I'll kill him.</i>

49:14.200 --> 49:15.200
I love you!

49:15.200 --> 49:17.400
Oh god. Say something.

49:17.400 --> 49:19.400
<i>- You okay with that?</i>
- I have been for the last three years.

49:19.400 --> 49:20.400
<i>I killed three girls.</i>

49:20.600 --> 49:22.600
And it felt so good.

49:22.600 --> 49:24.400
<i>- Would you die for me?</i>
- Yes.

49:24.400 --> 49:25.400
How did you come here?

49:25.400 --> 49:27.400
I'm the one
you can confide in, remember?

49:27.400 --> 49:29.800
<i>I buried the memory
over 150 years ago.</i>

49:29.800 --> 49:31.200
<i>Great. My little brother.</i>

49:31.200 --> 49:32.600
I can't afford to remember.

49:32.600 --> 49:35.600
Drop the gun Jack.

49:35.600 --> 49:37.400
<i>And you always remember
what you killed.</i>

49:37.400 --> 49:40.000
- Don't you, Jack?
- I let go of his hand.

49:40.100 --> 49:42.500
<i>It was the worst day of my life.</i>

49:43.305 --> 49:49.436
