00:05.220 --> 00:07.420
Our world is not always the same.

00:09.600 --> 00:12.400
Hidden from our view lies a
different world.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.770
Creatures utterly unlike us...

00:18.320 --> 00:20.155
..almost alien.

00:22.060 --> 00:25.519
Yet they are more numerous than any
other group on the planet.

00:30.580 --> 00:34.820
Welcome to the fascinating world of
the arthropods -

00:35.140 --> 00:40.020
spiders, scorpions and insects.

00:40.340 --> 00:44.060
Today we have new camera techniques
that will allow us

00:44.280 --> 00:48.320
to reveal in greater detail than
ever before their lives -

00:48.940 --> 00:53.420
the way they fight, and feed,
and reproduce.

00:53.540 --> 00:57.540
This series uses specially developed
3D camera technology

00:57.660 --> 01:00.900
to study the micro-world in
extraordinary detail,

01:01.420 --> 01:05.740
both on location, and in specially
constructed environments.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.960
We'll witness their births, the
challenges they face

01:09.280 --> 01:11.800
and the moments when their lives
hang in the balance.

01:13.540 --> 01:17.340
And that may help us understand how
it is that today

01:17.460 --> 01:22.780
over 80% of all animal species
on this planet are arthropods.

01:24.260 --> 01:27.180
In this series, we'll see the way
they have evolved,

01:27.700 --> 01:31.420
from the comparative simplicity of
the millipede,

01:31.540 --> 01:33.940
to vast colonies that contain
hundreds

01:34.060 --> 01:35.780
even millions of individuals.

01:38.260 --> 01:41.100
We'll witness the most extraordinary
transformations

01:41.220 --> 01:42.700
in the animal kingdom.

01:43.880 --> 01:49.200
We'll meet ants that farm, spiders
that can cast their webs...

01:51.000 --> 01:55.278
..and the bug that wears the bodies
of its victims as a disguise.

01:57.420 --> 02:01.008
Welcome to a strange and dangerous
world.

02:17.926 --> 02:20.046
Of all the arthropod adaptations,

02:20.260 --> 02:25.540
the most revolutionary has been the
ability to live in immense colonies.

02:25.860 --> 02:30.340
That enables them to hunt en masse,
to build huge constructions

02:30.460 --> 02:34.030
for a home and to dominate their
surroundings.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.097
Some colonies are quite small.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.999
Others contain as many individuals
as our largest cities.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.200
If great numbers of individuals
are to work together,

02:56.320 --> 02:58.160
they need to be able to communicate,

02:58.280 --> 03:01.261
to pass on information and
instructions.

03:03.560 --> 03:07.920
And doing that enables them
to maintain farms,

03:08.040 --> 03:12.440
to plunder the forest floor like
an invading army,

03:12.960 --> 03:16.034
and to build immense castles.

03:29.300 --> 03:33.700
Honeybee workers are able to send
complex messages to one another.

03:37.580 --> 03:40.660
In the wild, they sometimes nest out
in the open.

03:40.780 --> 03:43.220
But mankind has persuaded them
to live -

03:43.340 --> 03:46.031
and store their honey - in hives

03:47.980 --> 03:50.500
The colony's heart is its queen.

03:50.620 --> 03:55.276
She is just a little bigger than her
subjects - and mother of them all.

04:01.900 --> 04:04.500
In spring, when food stocks are low,

04:04.620 --> 04:07.503
the workers get busy collecting
nectar.

04:23.440 --> 04:26.360
They have a remarkable method of
telling one another

04:26.480 --> 04:29.333
where to find the most productive
flowers.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.940
It is called the Waggle Dance.

04:41.060 --> 04:44.820
This returning bee has just found a
new source of nectar

04:44.940 --> 04:48.206
and is going to tell others in the
hive about it.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.280
First, she gathers an audience.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.040
To do that, she climbs on her
sisters' backs

05:01.160 --> 05:03.778
and vibrates her abdomen.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.560
Now that she's got their
attention,

05:07.680 --> 05:11.040
she begins her dance using a code of
movements

05:11.160 --> 05:15.204
that tell her fellow workers where
her discovery lies.

05:24.140 --> 05:29.140
The duration of her waggle indicates
the distance to the nectar source -

05:29.360 --> 05:33.200
the longer the waggle, the farther
the flower.

05:33.820 --> 05:37.660
And the angle at which she dances
across the comb tells them

05:37.780 --> 05:41.399
the direction to the flower in
relation to the sun.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.000
Her instructions are remarkably
accurate

05:49.120 --> 05:51.680
and can pinpoint the location of a
nectar source

05:51.800 --> 05:54.151
over six kilometres away.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.280
Some of her fellow workers set off
immediately to find it.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.400
In one short season this colony's
workers will visit

06:06.520 --> 06:11.840
up to 500 million flowers and will
make around 90kg of honey.

06:12.260 --> 06:15.540
That is sufficient to sustain the
whole colony through

06:15.660 --> 06:18.520
the coming winter when there is no
nectar to be had.

06:21.260 --> 06:25.520
But dancing can only communicate
with a small number of individuals.

06:30.440 --> 06:33.960
In the forests of Africa there
are communities a thousand times

06:34.080 --> 06:35.320
larger than that.

06:37.860 --> 06:41.060
For much of the time they are
dispersed, ranging through

06:41.180 --> 06:44.894
the forests in dozens of columns
searching for prey.

06:51.720 --> 06:55.840
A driver ant colony may
contain 50 million individuals.

06:56.260 --> 06:58.923
And they're virtually all blind.

07:03.240 --> 07:06.360
Their community has no permanent
home,

07:06.480 --> 07:10.394
just a series of temporary bivouacs.

07:20.080 --> 07:23.040
The horde is coordinated by the
queen.

07:25.100 --> 07:27.060
Unlike her honeybee equivalent,

07:27.180 --> 07:30.687
she is many times larger than her
workers.

07:41.480 --> 07:47.040
Her size enables her to produce
at least 120,000 eggs a day.

07:54.340 --> 07:58.300
She is tended by the workers when in
a bivouac and carried by them

07:58.420 --> 08:00.405
when the time comes to move on.

08:01.640 --> 08:05.160
Soldiers with huge jaws guard
the travelling workers

08:05.280 --> 08:08.300
and attack prey when they find it.

08:12.240 --> 08:16.160
A colony of 50 million needs
a lot of food.

08:16.480 --> 08:20.120
The ants communicate by releasing
and smelling chemicals

08:20.240 --> 08:22.839
called pheromones.

08:28.580 --> 08:31.860
Earlier in the day, a scout found a
good hunting site

08:31.980 --> 08:35.299
and marked out a path to it by
laying a trail of pheromones

08:35.419 --> 08:37.039
on the ground.

08:41.440 --> 08:45.596
The hunters follow the trail,
sensing it with their antennae.

08:47.740 --> 08:50.380
Soldiers guard the flanks of the
rushing column

08:50.500 --> 08:52.660
while the smaller workers who will
butcher

08:52.780 --> 08:56.654
and transport their victims run down
the middle.

09:01.620 --> 09:04.420
Those at the head of the column will
tackle anything

09:04.540 --> 09:06.707
that is too slow to escape.

09:12.220 --> 09:15.300
They have found a slug and released
a different pheromone,

09:15.720 --> 09:20.205
this time into the air, signalling
that they need help.

09:24.760 --> 09:28.720
Workers and soldiers from all over
the area rush in for the kill.

09:37.580 --> 09:41.126
The soldiers' powerful jaws slice
into the slug.

09:45.940 --> 09:48.140
Fragments of it are sent back to the
queen

09:48.260 --> 09:51.383
and workers waiting in the bivouac.

09:57.440 --> 10:00.720
And within minutes, nothing is left
of the slug.

10:02.900 --> 10:06.620
By communication with pheromones
a colony scouring the forest,

10:06.940 --> 10:10.980
can collect hundreds of thousands
of victims in a day.

10:11.400 --> 10:16.168
That is enough to keep the queen and
her millions of subjects well fed.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.800
So she can continue on her own
particular task

10:22.920 --> 10:27.577
of producing enough offspring to
maintain the size of the community.

10:34.720 --> 10:38.600
An organised community of millions
can only work

10:38.720 --> 10:43.205
if individuals within it can
communicate with one another.

11:03.260 --> 11:06.980
Out on the sun-baked floor of the
Rift Valley in East Africa,

11:07.100 --> 11:10.430
daytime temperatures can rise
to 40 degrees or more

11:10.740 --> 11:12.340
and there's little or no shade.

11:12.460 --> 11:16.959
So the termites that live there
make it for themselves.

11:20.520 --> 11:24.147
They build air-conditioned castles.

11:35.285 --> 11:38.307
The queen lives in a special chamber
about a metre below

11:38.403 --> 11:40.500
the surface of the ground.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.240
By her side, a single fertile male -
her king,

11:47.360 --> 11:50.526
the father of the colony.

11:56.020 --> 12:00.300
Her pale fleshy abdomen is
distended with eggs.

12:01.540 --> 12:05.556
Her tiny head dwarfed by her
huge body.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.200
Soldiers guard the royal chamber,
their pincers raised,

12:15.320 --> 12:17.356
ready to tackle intruders.

12:19.900 --> 12:22.540
She is so huge she can't move by
herself

12:23.060 --> 12:27.926
and has to be tended by specialist
workers who continually groom her.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.880
She produces eggs almost
continuously.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.840
Attendant workers take them away as
soon as they arrive.

12:43.360 --> 12:50.078
She can lay thousands a day -
165 million over her 15-year life.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.720
But to produce this prodigious
number,

12:56.840 --> 13:00.320
she needs perfect conditions,
a steady temperature

13:00.440 --> 13:03.777
and a constant supply of
well-oxygenated air.

13:05.840 --> 13:10.765
If she doesn't get that, she will
die - and with her, the colony.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.160
Since she herself can't move,

13:14.280 --> 13:17.788
the workers have to create the
conditions that suit her.

13:21.740 --> 13:25.260
And they've done so by building
an air-conditioning system,

13:25.380 --> 13:30.420
a maze of chimneys and towers that
stand above her chamber.

13:32.380 --> 13:34.975
It can be nine metres tall.

13:37.380 --> 13:39.860
But despite the mound's huge size,

13:39.980 --> 13:43.540
not a single termite lives in it
permanently.

13:44.060 --> 13:46.980
They stay underground.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.772
The sides of the castle are studded
with holes.

13:54.247 --> 13:58.789
Animations show how gusts of wind
move across the savannah.

14:02.360 --> 14:05.093
Hot air blows into these entry
holes.

14:11.820 --> 14:14.580
The ventilation passages within have
many twists

14:14.700 --> 14:17.140
and turns that slow down the air,

14:17.460 --> 14:23.127
and as it slows, beyond the reach of
the sun's rays, it cools.

14:25.300 --> 14:31.241
The fresh air dispersing through the
mound displaces the old stale air.

14:35.300 --> 14:38.820
Outside, it's over 40 degrees
centigrade.

14:39.040 --> 14:43.407
But in the queen's underground
chamber - a comfortable 27.

14:44.818 --> 14:47.858
Working together, these tiny insects
have created

14:48.000 --> 14:50.307
a cool, air-conditioned home.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.920
Something they could
never have done,

14:59.040 --> 15:01.690
working as separate individuals.

15:06.360 --> 15:09.520
In Central and South America
in the rainforests

15:09.640 --> 15:13.120
other immense insect communities
have achieved something

15:13.240 --> 15:16.465
perhaps even more remarkable.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.960
These are Leafcutter ants

15:23.180 --> 15:26.420
and their underground nests are
gigantic.

15:26.540 --> 15:31.460
They can be 30 metres across and
contain eight million individuals.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.360
And they owe their success to
something

15:34.480 --> 15:40.060
they devised long before we did -
agriculture.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.840
Leaf cutters have found a way of
harvesting the vast proliferation

15:47.960 --> 15:51.160
of leaves produced by
the forest trees.

15:52.080 --> 15:55.502
They remove them piece by piece.

15:58.060 --> 16:02.418
But they don't eat them. In fact,
they can't even digest them.

16:08.260 --> 16:12.227
The leaves are fodder for their
underground farms.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.520
Like all complex colonies,

16:21.640 --> 16:25.564
the Leafcutters have a central
organising individual.

16:26.760 --> 16:30.040
Their queen is many times larger
than the workers.

16:30.260 --> 16:34.060
When she founded the colony she
brought with her a tiny piece

16:34.180 --> 16:38.545
of fungus that now grows in gardens
throughout the nest.

16:39.940 --> 16:45.020
As it grows, the fungus produces
little white knob-like structures

16:45.240 --> 16:49.680
which are full of nutrients,
which the ants can digest.

16:56.240 --> 16:59.600
Out in the forest, foragers cut the
leaves into segments

16:59.820 --> 17:02.140
and carry them back to the nest.

17:09.220 --> 17:14.704
They have sharp powerful jaws which
slice through the toughest leaves.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.240
The pieces they cut can be as much
as fifty times

17:21.359 --> 17:23.172
their own body weight.

17:27.079 --> 17:30.920
They can be so heavy that sometimes
only the larger major caste

17:31.040 --> 17:33.474
of the ants can lift them.

17:40.640 --> 17:45.600
Their nest may be up to 120 metres
away - a very long distance

17:45.720 --> 17:49.560
for a porter that is only a
centimetre long.

17:50.080 --> 17:53.880
Here, the smallest caste of ants in
the community, the minims,

17:54.000 --> 17:57.366
are hard at work in the underground
gardens.

17:58.460 --> 18:01.500
They receive the leaves from the
foragers, chew them up

18:01.620 --> 18:03.860
and feed them to the fungus.

18:04.080 --> 18:07.280
They are very fastidious and
constantly check to make sure

18:07.400 --> 18:10.920
that the gardens are kept clean and
properly watered.

18:11.540 --> 18:15.740
They also control the quality of the
leaves sent to them by the workers.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.020
If it suits them,

18:17.140 --> 18:20.980
they release a pheromone which
encourages the workers to cut more.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.660
If they dislike what they are
getting, they release

18:29.780 --> 18:34.367
a different pheromone that stops the
collection of that kind of leaf.

18:47.440 --> 18:51.120
A single colony of some eight
million individuals

18:51.240 --> 18:55.080
can harvest a fifth of the new
leaves grown each year

18:55.200 --> 18:58.800
by the trees in the surrounding
forest.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.480
Millions of closely related
individuals have become

19:02.600 --> 19:05.952
a single, integrated super-organism.

19:07.400 --> 19:11.680
The arthropods are the most
successful animals on the planet.

19:12.200 --> 19:15.560
We already know of over a million
different species

19:15.680 --> 19:17.880
and we are discovering
more every day.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.080
And the reason is quite simple.

19:20.200 --> 19:25.320
They've had over 400 million years
in which to evolve new ways

19:25.740 --> 19:29.100
of feeding and fighting and
collaborating.

19:29.420 --> 19:32.340
And the result is the
dazzling range of species

19:32.460 --> 19:34.540
that we see on Earth today.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.760
Quite simply, the arthropods are the
most successful

19:37.880 --> 19:40.184
kind of animal on this planet.

19:41.960 --> 19:45.000
In this series new technology has
enabled us

19:45.120 --> 19:48.360
to look at arthropods
in a different way...

19:48.680 --> 19:53.471
and reveal how they have adapted
over hundreds of millions of years.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.120
From the simple solitary lifestyle
of the millipede...

19:59.720 --> 20:03.480
..to the vast colonies containing
millions of individuals.

20:06.320 --> 20:08.680
We have traced the fascinating
techniques

20:08.800 --> 20:11.080
they've evolved in order to
survive.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.149
From the gruesome disguise of the
assassin bug...

20:17.580 --> 20:20.580
..to the bombardier beetle's
superheated defences.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.640
We've seen how a wasp can subdue a
cockroach

20:26.760 --> 20:31.194
and turn it into a helpless,
living food source for her young.

20:32.120 --> 20:35.887
Watched the extraordinary mating
dance of the scorpion...

20:38.600 --> 20:42.000
..and the praying mantis that
sacrifices his life

20:42.120 --> 20:44.446
in order to reproduce.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.640
All are the product of the same
simple drives

20:50.960 --> 20:53.130
that underpin all life.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.680
The need to eat.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.000
To survive...

21:05.240 --> 21:07.416
..and to reproduce.

21:10.860 --> 21:13.665
Some care for their young.

21:16.780 --> 21:20.910
Others transform
themselves in order to find a mate.

21:25.640 --> 21:29.600
And some create gigantic communities
that numerically

21:29.920 --> 21:32.640
rival our greatest cities.

21:32.760 --> 21:35.880
And thanks to today's extraordinary
technology,

21:36.200 --> 21:38.440
we're beginning to understand them
better.

21:41.040 --> 21:45.080
We like to think that we share the
planet with the arthropods.

21:45.200 --> 21:50.620
But you could argue that this planet
is more theirs than ours.
