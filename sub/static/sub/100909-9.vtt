00:06.850 --> 00:09.030
Italy's credit rating plummeted.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.460
Financial rating firm
"Standard and Poor's"

00:11.540 --> 00:13.590
downgraded the country's
rating by one step,

00:13.670 --> 00:15.780
deepening the economic
crisis of the eurozone.

00:15.860 --> 00:18.630
The agency also gave a
gloomy forecast regarding...

00:18.720 --> 00:21.560
Countries will unite
to influence other...

00:21.650 --> 00:26.140
Ireland, Portugal,
Spain and Greece 801 billion euros...

00:26.220 --> 00:28.930
Italy is too big to save.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.550
Nobody forces us.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.760
There is no invisible puppeteer.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.930
The devil tempts us with choice.

01:06.790 --> 01:09.630
We can love or hate.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.800
Be kind or cruel...

01:21.730 --> 01:23.770
Everyday...

01:26.050 --> 01:28.050
we choose our own path.

01:33.580 --> 01:35.580
Way,

01:37.010 --> 01:39.010
leading to heaven...

01:41.900 --> 01:43.900
or to hell.

01:50.530 --> 01:52.530
Hey.

01:53.180 --> 01:56.190
How is your father?
Still in the hospital.

01:57.020 --> 01:59.430
I thought you decided to
stay there. And do not fly.

02:02.370 --> 02:05.750
Did you see the news?
Dominic is winning.

02:06.510 --> 02:09.410
Can you stop him?
Stocks are useless to buy.

02:10.100 --> 02:12.410
It's too late for this. There
must be another way.

02:14.110 --> 02:16.110
I think he is.

02:16.300 --> 02:19.990
If I ruin my career,
I’ll drag Dominic behind me.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.200
Are you ready to go this far?

02:26.480 --> 02:28.480
Ready.

02:32.660 --> 02:36.550
Contact Duval and
say that I'm in business.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.560
Okay.

03:22.110 --> 03:24.500
It has already been
nicknamed the Battle of London.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.830
Bacchanalia with vandalism and arson.

03:26.910 --> 03:29.370
It lasts for three whole days

03:29.450 --> 03:31.910
while the police and other
structures are trying to stop her.

03:38.090 --> 03:40.180
Many thanks.

03:43.180 --> 03:45.180
What do you have there?

03:46.520 --> 03:48.610
Massimo returned last night.

03:48.690 --> 03:50.940
My man watched him from the airport.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.030
Yeah.

03:56.650 --> 03:58.650
He pretty much got it.

03:58.730 --> 04:01.160
I think he had a fight with
someone in his hometown.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.900
I see the girl for the first time.

04:03.980 --> 04:07.600
Her name is Sofia Flores.
She works for Sabterrania.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.620
On Daniel Duvall? Directly.

04:17.870 --> 04:19.870
Where is Massimo now?

04:33.120 --> 04:36.460
I wanted to congratulate
you on joining our battle,

04:37.970 --> 04:40.130
but you yourself are
only from the battlefield.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.400
This time without the police.

04:46.490 --> 04:51.120
So. Why did you suddenly
change your mind?

04:51.920 --> 04:55.070
Apparently, I am opposed to destroying
the lives of millions of people.

04:55.160 --> 04:59.610
I appreciate your good intentions,
but I already know how to save PIIGS -

04:59.690 --> 05:02.390
just making the document public.
This will confirm that "NYL"...

05:02.470 --> 05:04.470
This just can not be done.

05:07.530 --> 05:09.530
And why is this?

05:10.110 --> 05:12.170
If the market finds out

05:12.250 --> 05:14.970
that NYL has set up bankruptcy
for one of Germany’s largest banks,

05:15.450 --> 05:17.450
then both banks will fall.

05:19.050 --> 05:21.050
And rightly so.

05:21.580 --> 05:23.700
There will be an economic disaster.

05:23.780 --> 05:26.680
The second "Lehman Brezers".
Affect the entire continent.

05:26.850 --> 05:28.850
People will suffer.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.450
He is right. Or is he
trying to save his ass?

05:34.530 --> 05:36.690
On the documents,
his electronic signature...

05:36.770 --> 05:38.770
This signature is fake.

05:38.850 --> 05:41.490
I would not come if I did
not want to risk a career.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.500
I will turn to the press.

05:44.580 --> 05:47.300
I’m not telling you about the
documents, but about the murder of Ed.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.640
If this is made public,
Dominica can be stopped.

05:54.130 --> 05:56.130
Good.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.390
Publish your story.

06:00.590 --> 06:04.810
But if you give slack,
I will publish the document.

06:05.350 --> 06:07.350
It will not come to that.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.370
And he really is in love with you.

06:18.580 --> 06:20.850
Make an appointment
with Hillary Mason.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.460
She doesn't trust me anymore,
thanks to you, by the way.

06:25.670 --> 06:27.840
What will you do? I will
try not to lose my job.

06:28.730 --> 06:30.950
At least until the article comes out.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.020
These days have
historical significance.

06:39.370 --> 06:41.370
Historical.

06:47.550 --> 06:51.710
Sorry, I overslept. Worked until late?

06:51.880 --> 06:53.880
I plow there like a horse.

06:54.510 --> 06:57.370
And you try, boy!

07:05.200 --> 07:08.830
It's not just about reporting,
not just rioting,

07:08.920 --> 07:11.810
not only in politics and not only in

07:11.890 --> 07:15.310
Will the European Community
survive in its current form?

07:15.390 --> 07:17.940
After such a recession...

07:24.120 --> 07:28.850
In general,
it was great. Do you understand?

07:31.110 --> 07:33.110
Would you like a drink later?

07:36.610 --> 07:38.610
But what about your girlfriend?

07:45.740 --> 07:48.370
What is your face? Everything is OK.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.570
Mr. Morgan asked you.

07:53.870 --> 07:55.870
I'm coming.

08:04.030 --> 08:06.080
Oh, Massimo. Hey.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.930
What is it with your face? Nonsense.

08:12.610 --> 08:15.640
How is your father? All the same.

08:16.790 --> 08:18.790
Nina and I were worried.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.910
Everything is fine. Tell me.

08:27.820 --> 08:32.750
Before your departure,
we discussed your future in this bank.

08:36.580 --> 08:38.960
At home, I thought.

08:42.679 --> 08:46.000
And my answer is yes, I will stay.

08:48.340 --> 08:50.340
I want to stay.

08:54.890 --> 08:56.890
But I have to confess to you.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.130
I'm dating a woman

08:59.670 --> 09:01.670
which works for Duval.

09:06.090 --> 09:08.090
Wow recognition.

09:08.490 --> 09:10.930
Yes. But I did not know.

09:14.010 --> 09:16.360
And I can't break up with her. Why?

09:19.700 --> 09:22.220
Because Duval has the original CDO.

09:22.310 --> 09:24.520
How? Where did he get it from?

09:24.610 --> 09:26.610
I do not know.

09:26.950 --> 09:29.990
But I can’t get him back if they
don’t believe that I’m helping them.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.100
So it can be returned?

09:32.840 --> 09:35.050
Not immediately, but yes,
I think it is possible.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.360
And should I believe?

09:42.330 --> 09:44.330
Good.

09:45.360 --> 09:48.070
But your future depends on
the return of this document.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Thank.

10:00.780 --> 10:02.990
Find out what he is up to.

10:07.070 --> 10:09.480
It seems that the stages
of grief are one more.

10:10.240 --> 10:13.720
After denial and anger
comes desolation.

10:15.660 --> 10:17.870
I wish I could at least help you.

10:18.590 --> 10:20.590
You have done so much.

10:21.090 --> 10:23.480
Yesterday I received Ed shares.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.500
If you hadn’t explained what to say,
I would have been left without money.

10:27.890 --> 10:30.440
You and your children
deserve a decent life, Claire.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.700
So that’s all.

10:40.960 --> 10:44.070
It is proven that my husband committed
suicide. I can’t believe it...

10:44.550 --> 10:46.990
Ed was loved. And he knew that...

10:47.070 --> 10:49.610
As I understand it,
this fucking bank killed him.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.120
I’m unlikely to be able to
come to terms with this, right?

10:55.980 --> 11:02.880
The pain will not go away.
You just learn to live with her.

11:03.850 --> 11:06.740
Lord, Nina! How strong you are,
I forget everything.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.970
I’m talking nonsense here,
but you lost your son.

11:10.060 --> 11:12.060
Hey.

11:12.360 --> 11:15.620
We will survive everything.
We are stronger than we think.

11:30.420 --> 11:33.580
Ahem. Where is Mr. Ruggiero?

11:35.210 --> 11:37.380
Released. I don’t know where.

11:40.390 --> 11:42.390
Can you?

11:50.500 --> 11:54.000
You didn’t report anything.
Nothing to talk about.

11:54.610 --> 11:57.160
Massimo shorts the PIIGS,
as he was told. Like everyone else.

11:57.610 --> 12:00.380
But he is working on something
else. We want to know what.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.560
Then I need more. I want a contract.

12:07.730 --> 12:09.730
And you are not timid. I want to...

12:10.480 --> 12:14.820
contract for the position of a trader.
Not an intern, not an assistant.

12:14.910 --> 12:16.910
We will see.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.540
But first find out what
Ruggiero was up to.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.440
Alarms about the future of the euro

12:31.520 --> 12:33.520
sound in the heart of Europe...

12:35.270 --> 12:38.460
if the patient already
suffers from the disease,

12:38.540 --> 12:41.780
which covers 75% of his body...

12:48.030 --> 12:51.310
What are you doing here? Call me,
you would not come.

12:51.390 --> 12:54.950
And here you are right. Are
you Hillary? Massimo Ruggiero.

13:01.050 --> 13:04.630
So. What will happen to Italy,
Ireland and the rest,

13:04.760 --> 13:07.350
if Dominic Morgan realizes his plan?

13:07.580 --> 13:09.580
No food in stores, no money in banks.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.480
Mass riots.

13:13.810 --> 13:17.180
In the early elections they will vote
for a return to their native currency.

13:17.310 --> 13:20.010
And as soon as a couple
more countries do this,

13:20.600 --> 13:22.990
that's all. Euro end.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.920
That is, because of this,
Ed Stewart died?

13:26.380 --> 13:29.070
And my wife. When
will the evidence be?

13:29.410 --> 13:31.706
They are in front of you. I
am ready to confirm everything.

13:31.730 --> 13:34.780
Dominic Morgan will
deny your every word.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.140
And what do you want from me?
Should I go through a polygraph?

13:38.230 --> 13:40.270
I need evidence.

13:40.350 --> 13:43.480
Letters, reports, financial documents.

13:44.270 --> 13:47.450
And if you do not get them?
Then there will be no article.

13:48.050 --> 13:50.050
Call when you get it.

13:57.850 --> 14:00.510
I can’t get the
documents now. Why not?

14:00.620 --> 14:02.620
Dominic is watching me.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.010
I told him about us.

14:07.590 --> 14:10.340
Why did you do that? This is stupid,
Massimo!

14:10.430 --> 14:12.430
He already knew.

14:12.730 --> 14:14.730
He knew?

14:15.330 --> 14:17.686
So. It is necessary to issue
an article as soon as possible.

14:17.710 --> 14:20.510
I said these files cannot
be reached right now.

14:20.590 --> 14:23.450
I can not. Okay. Maybe we can?

14:48.360 --> 14:50.360
Massimo! Welcome back. Hey.

14:51.530 --> 14:54.390
What are you doing?
Why should I answer?

14:54.630 --> 14:56.850
Hey, come on. We are one team!

14:57.890 --> 15:00.470
I sell a hundred bitcoins,
one hundred and twenty bonds.

15:00.990 --> 15:02.990
Spanish debt... Yes.
Lighter than lung.

15:03.240 --> 15:06.046
So that by the end of the day there
would be three hundred long positions.

15:06.070 --> 15:09.140
Super. I thought about it myself.
Hi Sammy. You work great.

15:17.990 --> 15:19.990
May I have you?

15:23.940 --> 15:25.940
Not you.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.180
How do you? Fine.

15:33.260 --> 15:35.280
We trade as you said.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.660
Italy is on the verge.
Like Greece and Spain.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.880
What should we do? Go on.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.660
But,
Massimo... So I can’t stop Dominica.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.990
What are you up to?
In a backpack a laptop.

15:45.210 --> 15:47.320
Take it to the freezer and plug it in.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.430
It downloads several files.

15:49.510 --> 15:51.880
What kind of files?
You better not know.

15:52.290 --> 15:54.420
Are you sure? I am sure.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.910
And you do something else.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.360
What exactly?

15:59.450 --> 16:01.700
Say I got you.

16:01.780 --> 16:04.460
Fight with me. Right now.

16:10.710 --> 16:13.306
Are you completely out of your mind,
Massimo? Hush, hush, just don’t shout!

16:13.330 --> 16:16.136
Kalim and I worked for this, and now are
you flushing everything down the toilet?

16:16.160 --> 16:18.510
Yes, I know everything! Just
be quiet! Please calm down!

16:18.590 --> 16:20.840
You don’t want us to... Calm down,
please, be quiet.

16:20.930 --> 16:24.540
No! No! Wait, Eleanor! Al, come back!

16:48.020 --> 16:50.780
The laptop will be
connected to the NYL servers.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.960
When? Already connected.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.900
Here is the IP address.

16:58.930 --> 17:01.160
Is he asking for help? Yes.

17:02.370 --> 17:04.650
I said that we will help. Right?

17:05.619 --> 17:07.619
Yes.

17:11.010 --> 17:13.010
I need to know exactly
what we are looking for.

17:15.140 --> 17:19.040
On this flash drive a list of documents
that must be given to Hillary Mason.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.440
Here? Yes.

17:26.010 --> 17:28.720
Perfectly. Maybe he
really fell in love with you.

17:29.890 --> 17:33.220
But men like Massimo

17:34.010 --> 17:36.010
never change.

17:36.090 --> 17:38.150
He is on our side. He is a banker.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.980
He simply does not see the
difference between good and evil.

17:41.070 --> 17:43.590
He said he was with us, Daniel.

17:44.050 --> 17:46.370
Are you going to run away with him,
right?

17:49.430 --> 17:51.430
I have no idea what
are you talking about.

17:56.710 --> 18:00.040
I knew that one day I would
have to continue without you

18:00.860 --> 18:04.030
but just didn't think you'd
pick a fucking banker.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.030
Listen.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.900
I have no right to give
advice about my personal life.

18:13.070 --> 18:15.070
I don’t have it myself.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.300
Do you think he understands
what it means to disappear?

18:21.680 --> 18:23.680
Leave everything in the past?

18:24.890 --> 18:27.740
And live constantly looking back?

18:28.100 --> 18:30.160
I'm sure you know what you're doing.

18:39.760 --> 18:42.380
Fine! Let's get to work.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.680
It turns out that Europe is now
a plague site of the whole world.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.420
In fact,
nobody cares about such a trifle,

18:54.500 --> 18:56.500
like a slight downgrade.

18:56.580 --> 18:58.630
Washington should be grateful.

18:58.710 --> 19:02.940
Washington is worried anyway.
They are trying to save the euro.

19:03.030 --> 19:05.070
Washington should
not go into the wrong

19:05.150 --> 19:07.150
let him solve his problems.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.810
The riots in London.
How are people feeling?

19:10.500 --> 19:13.320
I suppose for most
it's just a picture on TV.

19:13.540 --> 19:16.220
There will be more unrest
throughout the continent,

19:16.300 --> 19:18.300
as soon as the euro collapses.

19:18.810 --> 19:21.360
This is a consequence of
unsuccessful state policy.

19:21.450 --> 19:24.620
This is a major victory,
Dominic. Congratulations.

19:26.580 --> 19:29.950
It's too early to congratulate
me. We have a different problem.

19:30.030 --> 19:32.660
Daniel Duval is sniffing something.

19:33.360 --> 19:35.360
This is really a problem.

19:35.730 --> 19:38.350
What does he know? Enough.

19:39.250 --> 19:42.550
And what will you
do? I’ll deal with him.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.760
Good luck to you.

19:44.840 --> 19:47.690
Many want to deal
with Duval for ten years.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.800
And I do not want, I’ll figure it out.

19:51.530 --> 19:53.720
Tomorrow already. You know how?

19:54.410 --> 19:56.770
Yes, I think Massimo told me a way.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.280
Then we will have a
reason to celebrate.

20:12.710 --> 20:14.710
What do I need to disappear?

20:15.420 --> 20:17.940
Dohrena. And where to?

20:27.230 --> 20:29.830
Listen Massimo

20:30.230 --> 20:33.120
I wouldn’t be a cop if I
didn’t ask what you got into.

20:34.780 --> 20:36.860
Tomorrow

20:36.940 --> 20:39.230
put an end to my career.

20:39.550 --> 20:41.550
Criminal charges? Maybe.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.170
Well, the main thing is to prepare.

20:46.870 --> 20:51.220
Escaping in a hurry is not
an easy task. But possible.

20:51.440 --> 20:55.080
The main issue is money. And
your name will become a problem.

20:55.270 --> 20:58.340
I'll deal. You will not have
time to explain to your family.

20:58.430 --> 21:01.460
No problem. Or friends.
Already explained.

21:13.980 --> 21:16.780
Hey. What happened to Massimo?

21:16.880 --> 21:18.880
And you need to know everything!

21:19.950 --> 21:22.430
Well, just we could go to the bar,
talk...

21:22.510 --> 21:24.510
Not today.

21:27.830 --> 21:31.750
Hey! Kay, buddy! What's up, bro?

21:32.210 --> 21:34.850
The earth still
rotates around its axis.

21:35.030 --> 21:38.350
C'mon brother, I saw a quarrel
between Eleanor and Massimo.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.480
Something happened?
It doesn't concern you.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.580
So it happened.

21:42.660 --> 21:44.660
Maybe you ask one of your buddies?

21:47.620 --> 21:50.660
Sure, not a problem! I’ll ask them.

22:13.050 --> 22:16.260
What. Heck! Why are you doing this?

22:17.030 --> 22:19.670
Hack my account again
and they’ll tear you out.

22:21.320 --> 22:23.700
Yes, he's kidding.

22:24.420 --> 22:27.640
Who do you think you
contacted? Goat horseradish.

22:43.190 --> 22:45.190
So.

22:45.270 --> 22:47.850
And then we multiply
this with this and get...

22:57.970 --> 23:00.380
Apparently,
another beautiful day at work.

23:00.670 --> 23:04.180
I was loaded in full,
there was no time to breathe.

23:04.790 --> 23:07.680
You're at home, take a break, finally.

23:08.290 --> 23:10.290
Yes, I’ll rest.

23:11.220 --> 23:13.870
This work cannot be more
important than brother.

23:15.250 --> 23:17.410
What? He got four with a plus.

23:17.510 --> 23:19.510
Mathematics!

23:25.760 --> 23:28.300
Did I dream it? Mathematics?

23:28.890 --> 23:31.330
Well done! What did I tell you?

23:31.410 --> 23:33.590
Well what did I say? Brains are all,
bro.

23:33.920 --> 23:37.060
And can I play the Xbox? Yes, yes,
yes, an agreement is an agreement.

23:38.830 --> 23:40.830
You are a hammer!

23:42.600 --> 23:44.980
He's doing well at school, Olya.

23:45.690 --> 23:48.350
I met with his teacher.
You should be proud of him.

23:50.860 --> 23:53.510
Let's hope they don’t fire me.

23:53.590 --> 23:55.590
This study is expensive.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.060
What do you mean?

23:59.310 --> 24:01.620
You are not telling
anything. I don’t know myself!

24:01.990 --> 24:03.990
Well what can I say?

24:07.260 --> 24:09.260
I am going to take a shower.

24:27.670 --> 24:30.780
Hey. Hey. Sophia Flores,
Terence Rigby.

24:31.530 --> 24:33.530
Miss Flores... Yeah. See you tomorrow.

24:33.890 --> 24:35.890
Till tomorrow.

24:39.450 --> 24:41.450
Who was that? A friend of mine.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.780
What does your friend mean?

24:46.650 --> 24:48.650
He helps us.

24:49.450 --> 24:51.450
Clear.

24:53.580 --> 24:55.580
How's Duval doing?

24:56.480 --> 24:59.540
He will have the files at the
latest tomorrow afternoon.

24:59.730 --> 25:01.790
Hope it's not too late.

25:03.950 --> 25:05.950
Do you think he made a copy?

25:06.030 --> 25:08.340
A copy of the CDO? Duval? No.

25:08.790 --> 25:11.550
This is dangerous,
a digital copy can be hacked.

25:11.650 --> 25:15.040
Need to pick up the document.
This is the only instance.

25:15.230 --> 25:17.740
If I take it, he will notice.
You have to find a way.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.310
Good?

26:15.950 --> 26:17.950
I do not want to be such a woman.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.360
What kind of woman?

26:22.450 --> 26:25.130
Which accuses her
boyfriend of treason.

26:28.050 --> 26:30.050
What?

26:32.700 --> 26:36.760
I smell her perfume,
Oliver. Do not deny it will be worse.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.360
I AM...

26:45.950 --> 26:48.150
I didn't ask for a better apartment,
Oliver.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.550
Or this expensive clothes
that you are now buying.

26:54.590 --> 26:58.310
I just wanted to know
that you love me.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.230
And you took it from
me. And what is left?

27:08.450 --> 27:10.810
Yes. I made a mistake. Do you hear

27:10.890 --> 27:13.510
Hey hey listen to me. Well?

27:14.600 --> 27:18.240
Hey wait. This will not happen again.

27:18.330 --> 27:21.200
Yes, Oliver. Will not
repeat. That one! The one?

27:21.700 --> 27:23.700
The one? Come back!

27:26.010 --> 27:28.010
Heck!

27:49.070 --> 27:51.310
In the morning I saw Claire Stewart.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.270
She does not believe
that Ed killed himself.

27:58.890 --> 28:02.170
Case is closed. It
can be opened again.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.670
Alex took care of this.

28:09.420 --> 28:11.630
Well? Sophia Flores.

28:12.450 --> 28:14.450
She is in Massimo’s apartment.

28:14.750 --> 28:16.750
Keep me informed.

28:17.580 --> 28:19.580
Thank.

28:20.310 --> 28:22.910
Massimo He still wants to stop me.

28:25.200 --> 28:28.440
After all our efforts? It’s sad.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.990
I hoped it won’t come to that.

28:37.180 --> 28:39.210
He looks so much like you.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.670
It was inevitable. Maybe.

28:51.220 --> 28:53.760
You fought so long and hard.

28:55.190 --> 28:58.350
And now you have to fight
him. We are almost there.

29:00.980 --> 29:03.250
It remains to hold out a little more.

29:29.710 --> 29:32.090
Who called? From the hospital.

29:33.250 --> 29:37.100
How is he doing? Things
are good. It is stable.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.320
Good. Yes.

29:41.760 --> 29:43.760
Yes.

29:44.380 --> 29:46.500
Ask Duval about the files.

29:46.580 --> 29:48.740
Of course, don’t worry, I’ll call him.

29:52.090 --> 29:54.180
We are live again!

29:54.260 --> 29:57.520
Police vans are
constantly attacking...

29:57.610 --> 30:01.660
Thus, austerity measures do
the exact opposite for the euro

30:01.750 --> 30:03.900
and only exacerbate the problems...

30:14.730 --> 30:18.030
Signor Ruggiero!
Bongiorno! How are you?

30:18.290 --> 30:20.290
Fine.

30:20.500 --> 30:24.060
Maybe we should have dinner? We haven’t
been hanging out together for a long time.

30:24.920 --> 30:26.920
Not today.

30:28.050 --> 30:30.610
Clear. You look bad.

30:31.380 --> 30:33.460
I need help.

30:34.470 --> 30:36.500
Paul commissioned
me with three clients,

30:36.580 --> 30:39.690
and if at least one of them does not
open a trust before the end of the month,

30:39.720 --> 30:41.720
I'm in the ass.

30:44.890 --> 30:46.890
OK OK. Listen up

30:47.810 --> 30:50.940
I see you are still short with PIIGS,
but you have reduced assets.

30:51.820 --> 30:54.180
Some magic of Ruggiero
is obviously involved here.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.320
And speak to them in Italian.

30:56.930 --> 30:58.930
This is a sure thing.

31:05.190 --> 31:08.140
I asked two weeks ago
to give me a SEG report.

31:08.230 --> 31:10.500
And I told you that it was impossible!

31:10.590 --> 31:13.540
This is not a request, Eleanor,
but an order! You understood?

31:13.630 --> 31:16.100
Get off me, Paul! Something is wrong?

31:17.170 --> 31:20.000
Yes. Yes. Miss Borg believes
that the rules do not apply to her.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.530
This is nonsense,
you know. I asked to keep me posted...

31:22.610 --> 31:25.320
This is my fault. I'm to blame.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
I asked her to hold everything.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.690
Are you really Yes.

31:32.070 --> 31:34.670
Give me a couple of hours
and I will send you a report.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.800
It just so happened for you.

31:42.230 --> 31:45.870
What? To deceive
everyone. Including us.

31:49.770 --> 31:51.810
Massimo, we need to talk about...

31:51.890 --> 31:54.090
I'll be back in a minute. Wait. Ok,
but those files...

31:56.560 --> 31:58.580
Hey! Al!

31:58.660 --> 32:00.660
Al, wait, please!

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Something happened?

32:04.090 --> 32:06.300
Are you going to the press?
Why did you decide that?

32:06.960 --> 32:09.210
What kind of files do you
download from the server?

32:09.640 --> 32:11.710
Tell me what's going on, Massimo.

32:14.630 --> 32:16.650
Now the matter is
not only in the bank.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Millions of people will be affected.

32:19.090 --> 32:21.110
Because of a weak government!

32:21.190 --> 32:23.560
Since when do we rinse
dirty laundry in the press?

32:23.650 --> 32:26.170
I already said you
better not know anything.

32:28.630 --> 32:32.460
All this time we were all
faithful to you, Massimo.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.560
Just don’t say that it’s all
because of the woman...

32:37.590 --> 32:41.370
Dominic has blood on
his hands. Ed and Carrie.

32:44.390 --> 32:47.630
So call a spade a
spade. It is a revenge.

32:51.950 --> 32:55.730
Losses in European markets have
been and are much more than ours.

32:55.810 --> 32:59.380
Spain today fell by more
than 5.5%. Many markets...

32:59.470 --> 33:02.070
Andy, will this situation teach us
not to spend more than we have?

33:02.100 --> 33:04.430
And can countries go bankrupt?

33:04.510 --> 33:06.960
This is a global issue,
and the solution...

33:07.040 --> 33:09.070
As for European debt...

33:09.160 --> 33:11.680
Countries cannot go bankrupt.
But the euro is losing ground...

33:38.820 --> 33:40.820
What happened?

33:45.120 --> 33:47.120
These files... What is
the matter with them?

33:47.200 --> 33:49.410
Someone is downloading them,
but not from your list.

33:52.140 --> 33:54.140
And which ones?

33:54.220 --> 33:56.730
Own algorithms of
high-frequency trading.

33:57.190 --> 33:59.190
I don’t even know how to read it.

33:59.270 --> 34:01.870
Anyone who hacked our server knows.

34:01.950 --> 34:04.430
And his virus is loading
our algorithms right now!

34:04.510 --> 34:06.510
Tell who it is, Massimo!

34:09.260 --> 34:11.850
Daniel Duvall. From Subterrania?

34:11.929 --> 34:14.050
Yes. Are you completely crazy? Hey,
be quiet, listen.

34:14.610 --> 34:16.940
He had to download only
those files that I showed.

34:17.110 --> 34:19.909
C'mon! I don’t understand
what is going on!

34:19.989 --> 34:22.800
He beat you. It is better
to disconnect the laptop.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.880
No, wait, wait, wait!

34:25.770 --> 34:28.330
When you turn it off, he will
immediately understand everything.

34:32.199 --> 34:35.780
Let it shake. Go on. Go away

34:35.870 --> 34:37.870
Your mother...

35:08.270 --> 35:10.270
Have you decided to trick me?

35:10.700 --> 35:12.700
What are you talking about?

35:14.430 --> 35:16.920
High frequency trading algorithms.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.690
Duvall, with my help,
steals them from NYL.

35:19.870 --> 35:21.870
Duval hacked you? Yes.

35:24.980 --> 35:27.070
It was you who suggested hacking NYL.

35:29.290 --> 35:31.290
Are you serious? It is me!

35:32.390 --> 35:34.420
You are talking to me,
Massimo! Yes I know.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.570
And I remember that you are
ready for anything for revenge.

35:40.100 --> 35:43.170
I would have to leave here and
leave you. So why are you sitting?

35:43.440 --> 35:45.700
Because now you are not your own.

35:46.930 --> 35:48.930
Because your father is dead.

35:50.430 --> 35:52.430
And you didn’t tell me anything.

36:04.710 --> 36:06.730
I didn’t want you to feel sorry for me

36:07.420 --> 36:09.550
while we have such problems here...

36:11.660 --> 36:13.660
This is all nonsense. I trust you.

36:16.050 --> 36:20.310
But you have to start trusting me.

36:43.270 --> 36:45.270
Lock the door.

36:56.820 --> 36:58.990
You're trying to dig under Massimo.

37:00.910 --> 37:04.680
No, what are you. Listen.
Are you listening or not?

37:07.130 --> 37:09.130
Apparently, yes.

37:09.720 --> 37:13.230
But don’t say what I told
you. I will deny everything.

37:13.920 --> 37:15.920
Okay.

37:16.380 --> 37:19.350
Massimo steals confidential
information from the bank.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.820
Someone from the side
hacked the "NYL" servers.

37:24.430 --> 37:26.610
Who! Heard of Daniel Duvall?

37:28.930 --> 37:30.930
What the heck?

37:31.010 --> 37:33.590
It seems that our
shark has a conscience.

37:37.670 --> 37:39.670
Why did you tell this?

37:40.370 --> 37:42.370
What did you say?

37:49.420 --> 37:52.430
Thanks for coming. I
could only contact you.

38:13.190 --> 38:15.190
What does it mean?

38:18.600 --> 38:20.600
Does he still want to do this?

38:22.230 --> 38:25.190
Duval set off completely. Do what?

38:25.390 --> 38:27.580
This is also why I left Subterrania.

38:27.670 --> 38:30.580
What to do? Destroy the global economy

38:30.980 --> 38:33.000
destroy the dollar.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.430
And then replace it
with cryptocurrency.

38:43.550 --> 38:45.630
He did not tell me. And will not say.

38:46.450 --> 38:50.060
He knows that you want to help the
world, and not destroy it and start over.

38:53.780 --> 38:56.030
Right Exactly.

38:56.820 --> 38:58.830
This is what he planned!

38:58.910 --> 39:00.910
But he will not succeed.

39:01.190 --> 39:04.480
Maybe he got the algorithms,
but he can’t destroy the economy.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.560
No, it will.

39:10.830 --> 39:13.670
He may, he knows how.

39:18.120 --> 39:21.050
Listen. You always
believed in principles.

39:22.650 --> 39:25.420
But these people
care only about power.

39:26.120 --> 39:28.130
They’ll kill you for her sake.

39:39.350 --> 39:41.350
Thanks Carlos.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.560
I have what you need.

40:46.890 --> 40:48.900
Our servers have been hacked.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.460
The IP address is associated
with a VPN that uses Subranrania.

40:52.260 --> 40:54.260
And did Massimo arrange it?

40:55.000 --> 40:57.560
I have no evidence, but this is it.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.700
May I get my contract?

41:07.130 --> 41:10.110
I hope I didn’t interfere. Actually,
it interfered.

41:11.500 --> 41:13.500
Have you been looking for me?

41:16.400 --> 41:18.400
Oliver, won't you leave us?

41:27.420 --> 41:30.340
I figured out Sophia Flores.
Understood? And how?

41:30.870 --> 41:33.680
She said that Daniel
Duvall hacked our servers.

41:34.840 --> 41:39.100
Have you stolen algorithms to replace
everything with your fucking cryptocurrency?

41:40.340 --> 41:44.710
And having destroyed the global economy
did you decide to enrich yourself?

41:45.670 --> 41:48.600
Even if this is true,
it’s a sin for you to complain.

41:49.110 --> 41:52.840
Truth? Power will again be
in the hands of the people.

41:52.920 --> 41:55.170
Pure democracy.

41:59.290 --> 42:02.600
This is not democracy.
This is anarchy.

42:03.850 --> 42:06.050
And a severe economic crisis.

42:06.540 --> 42:09.680
Riots, robberies, street violence...

42:09.760 --> 42:13.440
I am afraid that now
violence is inevitable.

42:13.530 --> 42:15.650
This is part of the process.

42:17.100 --> 42:19.100
You are worse than Dominic.

42:20.850 --> 42:23.550
Why didn’t you come
to me? I have come now.

42:36.970 --> 42:38.970
I have to stop you.

42:40.230 --> 42:42.230
Well,

42:42.460 --> 42:46.390
It is too late. You’ve
been ten minutes late.

42:47.470 --> 42:50.490
I now have all the
necessary algorithms.

42:50.910 --> 42:52.910
Thanks to you.

42:55.760 --> 42:57.760
And Massimo.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.840
Do not thank.

43:05.300 --> 43:08.740
Police Sergeant Henry
Winx! Do not touch anyone!

43:08.820 --> 43:10.990
To stand! Hands up!

43:11.290 --> 43:14.480
I said move away from
computers! Take it all away!

43:14.560 --> 43:16.790
Come in! Go-go! To stand!

43:16.870 --> 43:19.880
Daniel Duvall,
you are arrested for insider trading

43:19.960 --> 43:22.480
and violation of state secret law.

43:24.380 --> 43:26.550
You can keep silent

43:26.640 --> 43:28.760
but you must disclose the
facts during interrogation,

43:28.790 --> 43:30.990
which you are going
to refer to in court...

43:45.270 --> 43:47.686
How do we know that you didn’t
give Duval access to the servers?

43:47.710 --> 43:49.730
To report to you and
drain it to the police?

43:50.080 --> 43:52.080
There is no logic to this.

43:52.290 --> 43:54.290
Someone was helping Duval.

43:54.660 --> 43:56.730
The one who helped him get his CDO.

43:58.470 --> 44:01.410
Who! My laptop was stolen!

44:01.610 --> 44:04.990
This is a fucking setup! Mr. Morgan!

44:05.310 --> 44:07.430
This is ridiculous! Come on you!

44:07.920 --> 44:09.920
I beg! Aw!

44:10.800 --> 44:12.800
Mr. Morgan!

44:13.560 --> 44:15.570
I thought it was Massimo,

44:15.650 --> 44:17.650
and Paul stood behind it all the time.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.640
As I did not guess.

44:25.870 --> 44:29.650
Do you know what trust means? AND?

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Yesterday you came to my office.

44:42.990 --> 44:45.820
And asked to believe you. Again.

44:48.990 --> 44:50.990
Yes

44:54.070 --> 44:57.310
You asked Kalim to take Paul’s
laptop and take it to the freezer.

44:57.630 --> 45:00.110
So you can steal
files for Hillary Mason.

45:03.520 --> 45:07.290
We have our own people at
the Guardian. See what happens

45:07.370 --> 45:09.870
when you play on two fronts and lose.

45:09.950 --> 45:11.950
You have nowhere to go.

45:14.670 --> 45:17.640
We will see. You have
no idea what you are doing.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.290
You lied to me for the last time,
Massimo.

45:26.270 --> 45:28.270
You're fired.

45:35.750 --> 45:37.750
Alex

45:44.690 --> 45:46.690
Hands off.

46:45.990 --> 46:48.670
You must understand that
this is a system problem,

46:48.750 --> 46:52.260
which requires in one way or another
the complete elimination of bankers.

46:52.340 --> 46:55.120
They do not bring benefits,
but only worsen the situation,

46:55.200 --> 46:57.780
to capitalize on chaos.

46:57.920 --> 47:01.500
Somewhere by September,
October, or maybe November

47:01.580 --> 47:05.820
there will be a serious danger
that the eurozone will fall apart.
