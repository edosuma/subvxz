00:13.714 --> 00:15.186
Sex...

00:15.216 --> 00:17.188
Sexuality.

00:17.218 --> 00:20.224
What makes one person attracted
to another?

00:20.254 --> 00:21.825
What is attraction?

00:21.855 --> 00:23.194
Is it emotional?

00:23.224 --> 00:24.395
Is it physical?

00:24.425 --> 00:25.729
or...

00:25.759 --> 00:28.128
a little bit of both.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.335
I used to think you were either
born gay or born straight.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.536
Oops! Sorry!

00:32.566 --> 00:34.638
That's alright, sweetie.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.640
Nowadays, its okay to be what
they call

00:36.670 --> 00:38.509
"sexually fluid".

00:38.539 --> 00:41.812
But what does that actually mean
when it comes to relationships?

00:41.842 --> 00:44.482
You know, monogamy, commitment.

00:44.512 --> 00:47.285
Can you be a free spirited,

00:47.315 --> 00:48.619
sexually fluid,

00:48.649 --> 00:50.354
pansexual,

00:50.384 --> 00:51.422
bisexual,

00:51.452 --> 00:53.457
metrosexual

00:53.487 --> 00:54.625
monogamist?

00:54.655 --> 00:55.759
Oh and...

00:55.789 --> 00:58.158
also be Latin.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.367
Holy shit! I thought you were a
gringa!

01:03.397 --> 01:05.236
I don't know.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.437
I just know that...

01:06.467 --> 01:08.606
life is full of
exciting,

01:08.636 --> 01:10.208
unpredictable,

01:10.238 --> 01:11.242
pleasurable

01:11.272 --> 01:12.710
chaos.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.246
That, no book or class or parent

01:15.276 --> 01:17.148
can prepare you for.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.549
You pretty much have to wing it,

01:18.579 --> 01:20.584
and go with your gut.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.154
Always go with your instincts.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.851
Well,

01:24.918 --> 01:27.287
that's what an acting
teacher told me, anyway.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
* Cassanova Was a Woman *

02:01.289 --> 02:02.926
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.858
Are you okay?

02:08.729 --> 02:09.900
Are you okay?

02:09.930 --> 02:11.569
I think so. I think so.

02:11.599 --> 02:12.503
Thanks.

02:12.533 --> 02:13.837
Hey, I'm uh, I'm Lola.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.239
Hi, I'm uh

02:15.269 --> 02:16.407
I'm Cassanova.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.705
Thank you.
- Wait a minute.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.812
Hi! I am Cassanova.
"Cassanova"? Wow!

02:21.842 --> 02:23.581
That's a unique name.

02:23.611 --> 02:24.815
Especially for a woman.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.185
Yeah. Well, it's with the
two "s's" though.

02:27.215 --> 02:29.453
You know. Not the one 's'
like the famous lover.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.100
Oh yeah yeah. That is different.

02:31.130 --> 02:32.590
Hey, wait a minute.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.891
Are you in the 80's play?

02:33.921 --> 02:36.227
Uh, yeah. You?

02:36.257 --> 02:37.861
Yeah, I mean that's gonna be
fun.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.297
Ha! But I mean, 80's, ooh!

02:39.327 --> 02:41.565
Been there, done that.
You know what I mean?

02:41.595 --> 02:44.235
Yeah, me too!

02:44.265 --> 02:46.537
I hope they don't need this as a
coat rack,

02:46.567 --> 02:48.306
'cause I think I ruined this
thing.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.208
You know what? Let's get out of
here

02:50.238 --> 02:51.675
before we get busted, okay?

02:51.705 --> 02:53.000
That's a good one.

02:53.030 --> 02:54.845
So, you weren't
supposed to be in the show?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.614
No, but a friend on the
crew said

02:56.644 --> 02:58.316
they were looking for this
character

02:58.346 --> 03:00.218
and they couldn't find her.
So, here I am.

03:00.248 --> 03:02.215
I'm glad.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.555
I read with some of the
people that read for your part,

03:04.585 --> 03:05.950
They were horrible.

03:05.980 --> 03:08.226
Like they couldn't even do a
Queens accent.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.160
They were like,

03:10.190 --> 03:11.295
"Forget about it."

03:11.325 --> 03:14.465
as opposed to you know,
fuggetaboutid

03:14.495 --> 03:16.000
"Yo, you talkin' to me? "

03:16.030 --> 03:17.801
"Yeah baby, who else
would I be talkin' to?"

03:17.831 --> 03:19.603
"I grew up in Queens
and I walk my 'dawg'

03:19.633 --> 03:21.672
every morning, to get my cup of
coffee."

03:21.702 --> 03:23.641
We Hobokonites have the same
accent.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.276
So, you are from Hoboken?
Yeah.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.278
Yeah, I live in Jersey too
- the "burbs".

03:27.308 --> 03:29.880
Listen, I gotta go this way.
But I'll see you tomorrow?

03:29.910 --> 03:33.016
Well, you sure you don't want to
grab a bite to eat or something?

03:33.046 --> 03:35.253
Naw, I have a date.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.788
Who is this lucky...person?

03:37.818 --> 03:38.622
My husband.

03:38.652 --> 03:39.757
Oh, you're married!

03:39.787 --> 03:41.459
Yeah. Ten years.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.561
We have a romantic dinner
planned.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.563
Can't miss it.
See ya tomorrow?

03:45.593 --> 03:47.594
See ya tomorrow.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.479
I love you.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.718
I love you too.

04:52.793 --> 04:57.063
See you tomorrow, everyone.
Same time, same place.

05:27.761 --> 05:32.832
Excuse me, could you just,
excuse me.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.030
Cass?

07:07.060 --> 07:08.165
Cass!

07:08.195 --> 07:11.602
Oh my God! It's so good to see
you.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.871
Hola, chica, how's it going?

07:13.901 --> 07:15.873
I'm gonna come, sit with you.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.775
I don't think there's room
but...

07:17.805 --> 07:18.509
It's alright.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.510
Nice boots, girl.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.111
God, these young girls are big.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.145
Excuse me!

07:22.175 --> 07:23.747
Ooh, I think you lost something.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.549
How are you?

07:25.579 --> 07:26.149
Great!

07:26.179 --> 07:27.980
Oh my God!

07:28.248 --> 07:29.720
I'm great but can you believe
my agent sent me out for this?

07:29.750 --> 07:30.287
I'm gonna kill her.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.756
Why? You'd be perfect.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.825
What? What are you talking
about?

07:34.855 --> 07:36.594
Look around, Evelyn!

07:36.624 --> 07:39.830
I look like the offspring of the
Brady Bunch in this room.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.599
But you're not, okay?

07:41.629 --> 07:42.966
You're a Canto to me,

07:42.996 --> 07:44.968
you're more Latina than most of
these

07:44.998 --> 07:47.938
wanna be Nuyoricans who can
barely speak Spanish.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.239
You know how it is, Evelyn.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.074
Unless you look like

07:51.104 --> 07:53.544
Jennifer Lopez, you're not
Latin.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.679
Why does your agent send--
- Can you please just...

07:55.709 --> 07:57.748
You're not going to get it,
mama, I'm sorry.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.751
Why does your agent send
you out on this kind of stuff?

08:00.781 --> 08:04.121
Tell her that you want more
Anglo-Saxon...

08:04.151 --> 08:06.089
I tell her, I tell her but

08:06.119 --> 08:07.725
she knows I'm Cuban.

08:07.755 --> 08:08.826
You know, but it doesn't matter.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.729
I've been out for everything,
all kinds of roles,

08:11.759 --> 08:14.998
all American wasp, Eastern
European, Latina,

08:15.028 --> 08:18.636
Canadian, Alaskan, Scandinavian,

08:18.666 --> 08:20.203
everything in the book.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.839
Give me a U, give me an S,

08:21.869 --> 08:23.273
give me an A, a, a!

08:23.303 --> 08:26.839
What's that spell?
What's that spell?

08:28.676 --> 08:31.611
No really, what's that spell?

08:32.980 --> 08:35.919
Ouch!

08:35.948 --> 08:38.688
So you think because I am
Russian,

08:38.719 --> 08:41.721
I am a communist?

08:45.125 --> 08:47.259
Well, you are right.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.262
Are you Italian?

09:00.974 --> 09:01.812
That happened?

09:01.842 --> 09:03.647
It totally happened.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.048
Oh, that sucks, Cass.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.149
I'm so sorry.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.918
But you know, why do we do it?

09:07.948 --> 09:09.953
I don't know...because we're
freaks?

09:09.983 --> 09:11.722
Freakers are seekers, baby.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.256
That's true.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.025
Alright, so what side do you
have?

09:15.055 --> 09:16.827
Let's see, I am

09:16.857 --> 09:18.361
oh, shocker.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.097
Hooker #1.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.832
She has a fight with her pimp.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.267
That's uh, original,
really original.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.870
I got Hooker #3.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.673
At least we're not up for the
same role.

09:29.703 --> 09:30.307
That's good.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.075
Mine gets beaten and then

09:32.105 --> 09:33.644
questioned by the police.

09:33.674 --> 09:34.344
Good for you.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.913
I wonder who's got Hooker #2.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.214
Don't know. One of these
hookers.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.649
Cassanova Ciantu?

09:38.679 --> 09:41.652
Canto! Right over here.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.616
Wish me luck!

09:44.217 --> 09:47.024
Love you! Be careful.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.627
Nice booty.

09:49.657 --> 09:52.295
You know, I'm a huge
New York Beat cop fan.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.998
I've been trying to get
an audition for years but

09:55.028 --> 09:56.233
my agent actually says

09:56.263 --> 09:58.030
she knows you.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.266
She actually met you at
one of the parties that...

10:06.106 --> 10:08.307
Hi!

10:08.441 --> 10:11.778
I'm just gonna put this down.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.019
Any questions?

10:16.049 --> 10:18.184
Cassanova?

10:21.922 --> 10:24.261
Yeah, um...

10:24.291 --> 10:27.364
was she raped and beatin' first,

10:27.394 --> 10:30.930
before she got high and
'ovadosed', you know,

10:31.298 --> 10:33.904
or was she raped and beatin',

10:33.934 --> 10:38.175
while she got high and then
'ovadosed'? Because you know...

10:38.205 --> 10:41.240
that's stupi', yo!

10:46.379 --> 10:48.118
Suffice it to say,
they didn't buy me

10:48.148 --> 10:49.987
as a Latina
hooker, but...

10:50.017 --> 10:51.722
they would buy me as an Irish
one.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.357
Apparently they
think I'd make a better living

10:54.387 --> 10:56.193
on the streets of Dublin,
not Times Square.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.228
How's my Irish accent?
Is it okay?

10:58.258 --> 10:59.963
Better luck next time, Cass.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.995
Yeah, whatever.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.235
What else is going on?

11:05.265 --> 11:07.270
You asshole!

11:07.300 --> 11:09.773
I'm trying to share something
really important with you

11:09.803 --> 11:12.075
REALLY enlightening.

11:12.105 --> 11:15.145
And all you care about is
how you fit into the picture.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.081
I think I'm not in love with him
anymore.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.417
I don't know how this could
happen. We're...

11:20.447 --> 11:22.319
We're constantly arguing.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.888
Peter, you can't let go of
something that happened

11:24.918 --> 11:26.489
three years ago, and then
nothing.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.491
Maybe I should have cheated on
you too.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.690
We were so in love. It's...

11:31.925 --> 11:32.495
It's crazy.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.861
You lied,

11:35.128 --> 11:36.734
and you cheated on me and you
never really apologized for it.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.435
Nev...Never?

11:38.465 --> 11:40.070
Never apologized for it?

11:40.100 --> 11:41.404
Let me see,

11:41.434 --> 11:44.141
where is that freaking
affidavit?

11:44.171 --> 11:47.177
I have written testimony, that I
notarized

11:47.207 --> 11:49.112
stating the numerous, extensive
apologies

11:49.142 --> 11:50.480
that have come out of
this mouth.

11:50.510 --> 11:51.782
C'mon! That's bullshit!

11:51.812 --> 11:53.784
Why is it crazy?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.819
People do fall out of love,
you know?

11:55.849 --> 11:58.822
Yeah, but I thought I'd be with
him for the rest of my life.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.090
I don't think I can do it.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.258
I can't believe that
after all--

12:01.288 --> 12:03.026
I'm not gonna rehash this again.
I'm not.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.394
I'm not gonna rehash
this again.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.196
Well, yeah we are. Yes, you are.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.298
You're going to talk about this
until you realize

12:08.328 --> 12:10.133
Oh my God!

12:10.163 --> 12:12.335
There are other ways to torture
someone

12:12.365 --> 12:15.434
that are much more
humane.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.243
What can't you do?

12:20.273 --> 12:21.378
Live without him.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.014
We're discussing this.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.248
No.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.347
We are discussing this,

12:28.515 --> 12:30.053
and I'm saying it again,

12:30.083 --> 12:31.955
in a therapist's office.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.791
No more! Not here!

12:33.821 --> 12:35.822
I'm not going to...

12:35.956 --> 12:36.927
I've already told you, I am not
going anywhere, alright?

12:36.957 --> 12:37.727
Peter, c'mon!

12:37.757 --> 12:40.030
Please, just sit down and
listen.

12:40.060 --> 12:43.395
No! You made your bed,
now lie in it.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.406
How's the sex?

12:49.436 --> 12:50.874
In a word--

12:50.904 --> 12:51.474
horrible.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.343
Horrible?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.846
Do you two communicate about
that?

12:55.876 --> 12:57.114
Please,

12:57.144 --> 13:00.283
communication has
never been a problem for us.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.419
I told him a hundred times,

13:02.449 --> 13:04.154
he never does anything new,

13:04.184 --> 13:05.355
or anything I suggest.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.924
For the past ten years,

13:06.954 --> 13:10.127
we've been making love the
same-exact-way.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.895
I've introduced food,

13:11.925 --> 13:12.863
costumes,

13:12.893 --> 13:14.397
toys, gadgets,

13:14.427 --> 13:16.834
different places, different
positions,

13:16.864 --> 13:17.935
hands, tongue, mouth.

13:17.965 --> 13:18.936
He's introduced

13:18.966 --> 13:19.937
his penis.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.404
Was it ever any good?

13:21.434 --> 13:22.973
Well...

13:23.003 --> 13:24.507
I guess when we first started
dating,

13:24.537 --> 13:26.476
yeah it was hot and
heavy, but....

13:26.506 --> 13:29.212
he was never really
physically my type.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.177
What's your type?

13:33.013 --> 13:34.151
Okay,

13:34.181 --> 13:35.919
you know The Rock,

13:35.949 --> 13:37.855
Dwayne Johnson?

13:37.885 --> 13:39.923
That's my type.

13:39.953 --> 13:40.490
Peter?

13:40.520 --> 13:42.860
Not The Rock.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.962
I like tall; he's my height.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.297
I like dark; he's light.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.167
I like strong and muscular; he
had a potbelly by the age of 30.

13:50.197 --> 13:50.800
It sucks.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.170
Why do you think you stay?

13:53.200 --> 13:55.935
Because I did--

13:56.403 --> 13:59.542
I do really love him.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.913
Despite all the sexual mishaps,
I--

14:02.943 --> 14:04.447
he was the only man

14:04.477 --> 14:06.950
who really understood me.
We were so

14:06.980 --> 14:09.086
emotionally and intellectually
compatible.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.088
He got me. You know what I mean?

14:11.118 --> 14:13.385
I do know what you mean.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.059
I think we're gonna need to
continue this

14:16.089 --> 14:18.195
at your next
session.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.196
Sounds good.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.297
Vacation, huh?

14:20.327 --> 14:22.228
Yes.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.131
Sure. Have fun.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.204
How much did that
director love you?

14:27.234 --> 14:30.974
No, he thinks you are great too.
Besides, I'm married.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.009
But he's not.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.276
That's his problem.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.444
What about you, Lola?

14:34.474 --> 14:36.947
Are you married or with someone?

14:36.977 --> 14:39.082
Well, I broke up with someone
recently.

14:39.112 --> 14:42.052
Yeah, Sam and I were together
for about four years.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.054
We lived together and we split
up

14:44.084 --> 14:45.388
a couple of months ago.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.125
Wow, so recently.
Are you okay?

14:48.155 --> 14:50.994
Yeah, I'm fine, but it was
rough.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.462
I miss him.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.560
Of course, of course.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.199
You were practically married.
He was your husband.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.068
No. Lovers.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.070
Oh. Okay.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.072
Anyway, he was a douche,

15:02.102 --> 15:05.308
he would drop me
every time I got into a play.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.710
Are you serious? But, you are an
actress.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.412
What'd he expect you to do?
- Quit acting.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.148
So, what did you do?
- Kept acting.

15:11.178 --> 15:12.715
Good girl.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.717
Listen, I uh,

15:14.747 --> 15:17.320
I'd love to talk to you some
more, but

15:17.350 --> 15:19.556
I gotta go.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.324
Okay, I guess, see you tomorrow?

15:21.354 --> 15:22.392
See you tomorrow.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.257
See ya.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.180
Richard, I'm dying.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.482
Girl, you are always dying.

15:45.512 --> 15:49.286
No, Rich, I'm serious.
I'm completely obsessed.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.354
I never felt this way about
anyone

15:51.384 --> 15:53.556
in my seventeen
relationships.

15:53.586 --> 15:57.527
You know, I knew her
the minute I met her.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.062
She's different.

15:59.092 --> 15:59.729
She's it.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.199
It? Honey, she's straight.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.334
I know, but there's something
about her.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.503
I mean, she seems
to be attractive,

16:06.533 --> 16:08.171
but she's not even aware.

16:08.201 --> 16:11.408
She has got to be aware, honey!

16:11.438 --> 16:13.310
Why do you wanna be

16:13.340 --> 16:16.313
treading in that unchartered
wilderness for anyway?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.415
Stick with the village.

16:18.445 --> 16:21.447
What you know!

16:26.286 --> 16:27.757
What about Sara?

16:27.787 --> 16:31.061
She's bi and Lord knows, she's
beautiful.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.496
Yeah, she's beautiful, but
she doesn't have "it".

16:33.526 --> 16:37.300
You know this, this Cassanova
she has it all.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.070
She's so smart and talented.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.504
Oh!

16:41.534 --> 16:42.372
You know she works for morning
radio.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.374
Oh no, I was listening to her
today,

16:44.404 --> 16:45.742
she was so great.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.610
She was funny and--
- Straight.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.279
warm--
- Straight!

16:49.309 --> 16:52.082
And, so beautiful.
- Still straight!

16:52.112 --> 16:53.516
Would you shut up with that.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.718
What the hell are you gonna do
with a straight woman

16:55.748 --> 16:57.354
besides go shopping?

16:57.384 --> 17:04.256
Oh, I can do plenty if she'd let
me.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.396
Oh my God, there she is!
There she is!

17:07.426 --> 17:09.266
How's my hair?

17:09.296 --> 17:10.067
Nighmare on Elm street, right?
Oh my God.

17:10.097 --> 17:12.102
Alright, my make up?
My make up?

17:12.132 --> 17:14.671
My basic face?
What about my lips?

17:14.701 --> 17:15.505
Get my lipstick!

17:15.535 --> 17:16.606
Damn, L.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.842
You would think you'd be
meeting Shakira or somebody.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.844
Oh God. Damn!

17:21.874 --> 17:23.780
It's the wrong shade.
Can you give me yours?

17:23.810 --> 17:26.116
You know I don't carry that shit
with me.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.117
It stays at Lucky Chang's.

17:28.147 --> 17:30.087
I only wear that stuff for my
act.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.089
Now calm down.

17:32.119 --> 17:35.121
You look gorgeous.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.694
If you just fluff up your hair a
little bit,

17:37.724 --> 17:41.160
you got any hairspray
in that trunk of yours?

17:43.330 --> 17:45.635
I forgot the hairspray.
This is the worst.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.371
Honey, this is not the worst.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.807
Mamma here will tell you
about some worst times.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.176
Now, calm down.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.844
Hey Lola! What's up?

17:54.874 --> 17:57.247
I'm starving, can I join you?

17:57.277 --> 17:58.815
Sure, sure.

17:58.845 --> 18:02.219
Cassanova, this is Richard.
Richard, this is Cassanova.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.154
Hi! Pleasure meeting you.

18:04.184 --> 18:07.790
Pleasure to meet you, Cassanova.

18:07.820 --> 18:08.725
I'm starving.

18:08.755 --> 18:13.225
Okay so what were you guys
talking about?

18:15.795 --> 18:19.165
So for the
next two weeks, we rehearsed.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.139
We were only one of the
one acts in the festival

18:22.169 --> 18:25.371
but, we were the best one.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.677
Lola and I grew very close.

18:27.707 --> 18:31.477
It was really somewhat kismet.

18:31.711 --> 18:34.717
I felt like, I knew her for
centuries.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.254
The fun was non-stop.

18:37.284 --> 18:41.187
Even though, Peter and I
kept arguing.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.256
She kept listening.

18:44.491 --> 18:50.167
She was kind, supportive, wise
and well, fun.

18:50.197 --> 18:53.465
So much fun.

20:07.774 --> 20:11.643
Then, opening night
came.

20:12.479 --> 20:13.416
We hadn't done a line drill,

20:13.446 --> 20:15.352
so we decided to meet
at the coffee shop

20:15.382 --> 20:18.020
to go over our lines
before call.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.357
I can't believe it's opening
night already.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.692
We've only rehearsed for two
weeks. I can't wait.

20:22.722 --> 20:23.693
Yeah, me neither.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.862
Hey listen Cass, I got to tell
you something--

20:25.892 --> 20:27.364
- Hello, ladies!

20:27.394 --> 20:29.666
Can I get you something to
drink?

20:29.696 --> 20:32.469
No, I'll just um,
I'll just have a cup of coffee.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.504
And I will have a diet coke.

20:34.534 --> 20:37.536
Sure thing. Coming right up.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.311
He's cute.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.979
Yeah, yeah. He's cute.
Listen, Cass,

20:43.009 --> 20:45.915
uh, I got to tell you something.
It's kinda personal.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.717
I got to tell you before Sara
gets here.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.518
- Sure, sure hon,

20:48.548 --> 20:50.052
you know you can tell me
anything.

20:50.082 --> 20:50.987
Are your parents okay?

20:51.017 --> 20:53.956
Yeah, they're fine.
It's just that um...

20:53.986 --> 20:55.625
I should've told you this

20:55.655 --> 20:58.428
a couple of weeks ago,
in the beginning.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.492
One second.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.900
Hold that thought. Sara?

21:03.930 --> 21:05.902
Yeah, I have a pair.
Only one?

21:05.932 --> 21:07.937
Sure.
Bye, bye.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.639
It was Sara.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.441
She wanted to know if I had

21:11.471 --> 21:14.076
an extra pair of lace gloves
for the Madonna scene.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.546
Yeah, that's nice. That's nice.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.348
That's nice?

21:18.378 --> 21:20.049
Jeez, Lola, what's going on?

21:20.079 --> 21:23.281
Here you go, ladies.

21:23.650 --> 21:26.618
Thank you.
-Enjoy your coffee.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.622
I will.

21:31.891 --> 21:32.962
Cass--

21:32.992 --> 21:34.964
Lola, check this out.

21:34.994 --> 21:38.100
This guy gave me his number.

21:38.130 --> 21:42.071
Call me sometime so I can
give you some "real" service.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.302
I can't believe this

21:44.371 --> 21:45.775
I get more action married
than when I was single.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.777
Cass

21:47.807 --> 21:49.946
Can I call you Cass?

21:49.976 --> 21:52.649
Only my really good friends call
me Cass.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.517
you know, so...

21:54.547 --> 21:56.786
Cass, I'm bisexual and
Sam is really Samantha.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.456
Okay,
right now you should be seeing

21:59.486 --> 22:01.558
a light bulb over my head!

22:01.588 --> 22:02.492
You see it?!

22:02.522 --> 22:04.627
Okay, maybe you don't.
But it's there!

22:04.657 --> 22:07.659
Don't ask me right now why
because,

22:07.760 --> 22:08.931
I don't know.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.933
But for a split second,

22:10.963 --> 22:13.965
there was a flash.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.739
And?

22:16.769 --> 22:18.741
"And"?

22:18.771 --> 22:20.877
I just told you that I was into
women also

22:20.907 --> 22:22.845
and that I lied to you about

22:22.875 --> 22:24.914
Samantha who I've been in a
relationship with

22:24.944 --> 22:26.015
for four years.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.751
We live-- why aren't you
surprised?

22:28.781 --> 22:30.687
I don't know.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.088
I'm just not.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.556
What I am surprised about

22:33.586 --> 22:36.025
is the fact that you didn't
tell me sooner.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.727
I mean, I thought we were
friends.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.729
I'm sorry. It's just that you
know,

22:39.759 --> 22:42.765
people judge you when they hear
you are a little different.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.767
Oh, you're different alright.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.869
But it has nothing to do with
your sexuality.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.638
"This"
actually makes you normal.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.540
Shut up! I'm sorry, really.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.909
I mean, if you have to
worry about anybody

22:52.939 --> 22:55.177
treating you differently
because of part of who you are,

22:55.207 --> 22:57.013
then the sooner you can
get rid of them.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.648
It's a good way to narrow down

22:58.678 --> 23:00.116
the good friends
from the crappy ones.

23:00.146 --> 23:03.052
You are right. You are
absolutely right.

23:03.082 --> 23:06.088
Oh God, I feel like such a great
weight has been lifted

23:06.118 --> 23:08.825
off my shoulder.
You have no idea.

23:08.855 --> 23:12.662
Can't believe you think I would
treat you differently or

23:12.692 --> 23:15.665
change my attitude towards you
just because

23:15.695 --> 23:16.766
you're a rugmuncher.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.801
Great! Epithets!

23:18.831 --> 23:21.704
So you like a little
something, something

23:21.734 --> 23:24.774
muffin with your
sausage in the morning.

23:24.804 --> 23:28.574
I'm starting to regret
having told you.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.449
Cass, is my hair high enough?

23:32.479 --> 23:33.583
High enough?

23:33.613 --> 23:34.951
Lola, it's an edifice.

23:34.981 --> 23:38.821
You've got Empire State
Building, Sears Tower

23:38.851 --> 23:40.523
Lola's Hair!

23:40.553 --> 23:43.555
Places everyone!

23:45.091 --> 23:46.896
Fuacata!
- Break a leg, gorgeous.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.928
You too, sexy thing.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.886
Oh my God!

24:09.916 --> 24:11.988
They loved it.
They totally loved it.

24:12.018 --> 24:13.556
We were pretty funny.

24:13.586 --> 24:16.593
Are you kidding me, hon'!
You were hysterical!

24:16.623 --> 24:21.192
You're so easy to play with.
- I know. I am pretty amazing.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.966
Listen Cass, what are you doing
tonight?

24:23.996 --> 24:26.268
I don't know, I got to see
what Peter wants to do.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.906
Oh 'cause there's this really
great party that I am going to

24:29.936 --> 24:32.709
I think would be terrific,
if you wanted to come with.

24:32.739 --> 24:34.811
Sure, I just gotta see what
Peter wants to do.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.078
I'm sure it'll be fine.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.848
Well, it's...it's not your
average party.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.183
Oh no? What kind of party is it?

24:41.213 --> 24:45.717
It's at a lesbian club. It's an
all girl party,

24:46.218 --> 24:50.088
but there's always a lot of
mixed couples there.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.595
Okay.

24:52.625 --> 24:55.031
That's totally cool.

24:55.061 --> 24:58.300
I'm sure Peter won't mind.
Besides, you know straight guys.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.567
Oh, I do know straight guys.

25:09.609 --> 25:12.148
This place is great!
Have you been here before?

25:12.178 --> 25:15.685
Yeah, yeah, a couple of times.
One of my friends works here.

25:15.715 --> 25:18.988
What can I get you to drink?
First round is on the house.

25:19.018 --> 25:22.959
Thanks! I'll have a vodka
martini with olives, dirty.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.093
Peter?

25:24.123 --> 25:26.095
I'll have a rum and Coke,
thanks.

25:26.125 --> 25:29.094
Rum & Coke, okay.

25:30.897 --> 25:33.002
Are you still hooked on her?

25:33.032 --> 25:35.772
There's no way I'm getting
unhooked.

25:35.802 --> 25:40.142
Well, you better sweetie.
She's absolutely straight.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.612
She has a husband, for God's
sake.

25:42.642 --> 25:44.681
I know, but I sense something.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.684
I don't know, maybe it's wishful
thinking.

25:47.714 --> 25:50.219
Maybe?! It is!

25:50.249 --> 25:52.655
You know what Richard,
I am serious.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.691
We have a definite
connection.

25:54.721 --> 25:57.026
Besides, she's not
happy with him.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.962
That doesn't mean she
will be happy with a woman.

25:59.992 --> 26:04.963
Well, I know. But one can always
dream, can't one?

26:06.365 --> 26:10.006
You were great tonight, honey.
- Thanks, babe.

26:10.036 --> 26:14.911
Lola's really easy to work with.
You know I really like her.

26:14.941 --> 26:18.715
Oh yeah, I do too.

26:18.745 --> 26:22.948
But I definitely like you more.

26:24.784 --> 26:29.025
Maybe she's not straight, but at
worst, she's bi.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.994
Maybe she's into you and doesn't
know it.

26:32.024 --> 26:35.160
You think?

26:35.427 --> 26:37.066
Maybe not.

26:37.096 --> 26:40.065
Give me the damn spritzer!

27:00.119 --> 27:02.191
I'm going to the bar to get a
drink. You want something?

27:02.221 --> 27:05.657
Yeah, another rum and Coke.
Thanks, babe.

27:15.234 --> 27:18.675
Do you want a drink?
- I don't drink anymore.

27:18.705 --> 27:21.006
Huh?
- No.

27:24.176 --> 27:27.746
There she is.

27:30.717 --> 27:33.719
Well, have fun.

27:40.927 --> 27:43.161
Working the room, huh?

27:45.164 --> 27:47.169
I see you're keeping yourself
occupied.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.438
Oh, I wasn't expecting you.

27:49.468 --> 27:52.709
Yeah, of course you weren't.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.844
So, where's Peter?

27:54.874 --> 27:57.876
Checking out the scene.

28:04.283 --> 28:09.320
He's a, he's a really terrific
guy.

28:09.822 --> 28:12.428
Yeah, he really liked you in the
play.

28:12.458 --> 28:15.297
Oh, great, great.

28:15.327 --> 28:19.368
Richard! I need another drink,
please.

28:19.398 --> 28:23.434
Vodka martini, dirty with olives
and a rum and Coke.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.843
You,

28:26.873 --> 28:29.912
can really dance.

28:29.942 --> 28:35.785
You don't know how much I wish
we could dance together.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.916
Who says we can't?

30:03.936 --> 30:06.943
Baby it's getting late,
maybe we should get going.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.377
Yeah,

30:08.407 --> 30:11.948
it's getting late. I'm a little
tired.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.980
I'll go get our coats.
- Okay, thanks.

30:18.885 --> 30:21.958
So...you got your dance.

30:21.988 --> 30:24.990
I sure did.

30:33.332 --> 30:37.206
Lola, can I ask you a question?
- Sure. Anything.

30:37.236 --> 30:39.541
It's kinda personal and if

30:39.571 --> 30:42.044
I don't ask you now,
I probably never will.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.575
Go ahead.

30:45.144 --> 30:47.884
What would you say if

30:47.914 --> 30:49.886
a straight friend wanted to kiss
you?

30:49.916 --> 30:55.191
If that straight friend was you
I would say, 'Thank you, Lord! '

30:55.221 --> 30:58.127
Praise Jesus!

30:58.157 --> 31:00.225
I'm sorry.

31:06.165 --> 31:08.270
I cant' believe it's 3 AM
already.

31:08.300 --> 31:11.302
I know, wow, the night flew.

31:12.171 --> 31:15.577
So...when am I gonna get that
kiss?

31:15.607 --> 31:18.314
Lola, you can't get it now.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.316
Why not?
- Why not?!

31:20.346 --> 31:23.519
C'mon, just a quick little kiss;
Peter won't even notice.

31:23.549 --> 31:24.653
No! No way, I can't.

31:24.683 --> 31:29.387
I won't be able to sleep
if you don't kiss me goodnight.

31:41.467 --> 31:44.473
What the hell was that?

31:44.503 --> 31:46.475
Oh, you can do much better.

31:46.505 --> 31:50.675
Yes. I can.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.681
But not here.

31:52.711 --> 31:56.318
C'mon, let's go; it's hot in
here.

31:56.348 --> 31:59.350
Yeah.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.125
Listen Cass, I got to tell you
something.

32:03.155 --> 32:06.157
It's okay.

32:07.559 --> 32:10.461
I know what you're gonna say.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.970
I think I feel the same way too.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.205
This is ridiculous.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.674
I can't believe how giddy I
feel.

32:18.704 --> 32:22.111
By the same token, I...I...
it's rough for me.

32:22.141 --> 32:24.213
I know your situation.

32:24.243 --> 32:27.116
I know.

32:27.146 --> 32:31.353
Why don't we just go with the
feeling?

32:31.383 --> 32:34.019
For now.

32:36.722 --> 32:42.098
Here you go, ladies.

32:42.128 --> 32:46.531
What a great night, huh?

33:32.178 --> 33:34.383
Hello, Lola? It's Cassanova.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.218
How are you feeling?

33:36.248 --> 33:38.220
I didn't sleep a wink all night.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.421
Fabulous!

33:39.451 --> 33:42.720
Yeah, me too. Listen,

33:43.489 --> 33:46.095
I have to see you today.
We have to talk.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.730
Can we meet for a lunch or
something?

33:48.760 --> 33:50.832
Maybe before the matinee?
At the coffee shop?

33:50.862 --> 33:52.834
Sure. About noon?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.836
Yeah, that's perfect.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.838
Okay. See you then.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.140
See you then.

33:58.170 --> 34:01.172
Oh, Lola?
- Yeah?

34:01.807 --> 34:04.113
I still owe you that kiss.

34:04.143 --> 34:06.115
Yeah, you do.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.216
See you later.
- Bye.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.114
Bye.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.321
RICHARD!

34:57.263 --> 34:58.900
I'm so sorry. I'm late.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.502
Have you been waiting long?

35:00.532 --> 35:02.238
No, I just got here.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.235
Excuse me, ma'am.

35:04.503 --> 35:06.475
You told me to let you know when
it was past twelve. It is 12:20.

35:06.505 --> 35:09.507
Thank you.

35:10.542 --> 35:14.245
Run along now.

35:16.515 --> 35:19.221
I'm so sorry. I live really far.

35:19.251 --> 35:22.253
Did you order anything?
- No.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.768
I'm not even hungry, which is,

35:32.798 --> 35:36.238
which is weird because I'm
usually starving by this time.

35:36.268 --> 35:39.337
Are you lovely ladies ready to
order?

35:39.538 --> 35:42.844
You know what? I'll just have
some coffee.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.846
And some eggs.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.848
Scrambled.

35:46.878 --> 35:50.252
Whole grain toast, just a little
bit of butter.

35:50.282 --> 35:53.189
and Greek yogurt,
do you have Greek yogurt?

35:53.219 --> 35:55.524
Greek yogurt. With a little bit
of granola sprinkled.

35:55.554 --> 35:57.826
Some berries, too. Some uh,
blueberries.

35:57.856 --> 36:01.430
I'm allergic to strawberries.
Cross-contamination.

36:01.460 --> 36:03.432
Are you expecting anyone else,
or...

36:03.462 --> 36:07.365
Okay, so that's it. Okay.

36:07.733 --> 36:10.206
I'll have the same.

36:10.236 --> 36:12.941
All of it?

36:12.971 --> 36:16.307
Okie dokie. Coming right up.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.315
I can't believe you called me
today.

36:19.345 --> 36:21.317
I can't believe I did either.

36:21.347 --> 36:27.289
Jesus! I feel like a teenager
and for me that's going a ways.

36:27.319 --> 36:28.257
Me too.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.725
Here's your coffee.

36:29.755 --> 36:33.924
'The best part of waking up'

36:37.929 --> 36:43.368
because there's... 'Folger's in
your cup.'

36:47.373 --> 36:50.741
Let me know if you need anything
else.

36:52.844 --> 36:56.318
Listen Cass, I'm just gonna
come right out and say this.

36:56.348 --> 36:59.688
I'm not going to waste time on
games or double talk.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.690
Because I'm too told for that.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.460
I've been in so many
relationships,

37:04.490 --> 37:07.663
that I really should know what I
want and--

37:07.693 --> 37:12.634
Well, this...is big for me.

37:12.664 --> 37:17.273
I mean...I'm gonna say it.

37:17.303 --> 37:19.908
You could be air to breathe for
me.

37:19.938 --> 37:24.742
I could be with you for the rest
of my life.

37:26.478 --> 37:28.550
Whoa!

37:28.580 --> 37:30.552
That's intense.

37:30.582 --> 37:34.423
My God! I'm such an idiot.
It's too soon.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.925
You're married. We just met.
I wanna throw up.

37:36.955 --> 37:37.893
Your eggs!

37:37.923 --> 37:41.430
Oh Jeez, I'm not even hungry.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.598
Neither am I.

37:42.628 --> 37:44.032
I shouldn't have said anything.

37:44.062 --> 37:47.303
No, you should've.
It's what you are feeling.

37:47.333 --> 37:49.834
But--
- I'm glad you said it.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.641
But your reaction--

37:52.671 --> 37:55.577
My reaction was what it is.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.779
That is intense, but it doesn't
mean

37:57.809 --> 38:01.446
I don't totally appreciate it
and

38:02.013 --> 38:03.552
really love it.

38:03.582 --> 38:04.720
Love it? Would you be my
girlfriend?

38:04.750 --> 38:07.523
What?

38:07.553 --> 38:12.990
Well, I don't know. Do you wanna

38:13.091 --> 38:16.698
have my pin and go to a drive in
movie for an ice cream soda?

38:16.728 --> 38:18.667
What is this Happy Days -
Lesbian style?

38:18.697 --> 38:20.669
I don't know what I'm saying.

38:20.699 --> 38:22.671
Listen to me,

38:22.701 --> 38:25.807
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about my marriage

38:25.837 --> 38:30.812
'Cause it ended long before I
met you.

38:30.842 --> 38:33.682
I can't cheat on him because
I love him too much for that.

38:33.712 --> 38:37.953
I...I just need time.

38:37.983 --> 38:44.826
It's kinda weird, this situation
being with a woman. It's weird.

38:44.856 --> 38:48.964
Can we just take it slow...for
now.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.966
I'm gonna be crushed.

38:50.996 --> 38:51.900
What? Don't say that.

38:51.930 --> 38:54.069
What if right before
you've been crushed,

38:54.099 --> 38:55.537
you had the time of
your life?

38:55.567 --> 38:57.072
I still would have been crushed.

38:57.102 --> 38:58.774
But it would have all been worth
it.

38:58.804 --> 39:01.643
Obviously, you have never been
crushed.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.979
We're gonna be late.
- Yeah c'mon, let's go.

39:04.009 --> 39:08.149
We didn't even touch our food.
- I am still not hungry.

39:08.179 --> 39:11.382
I am!

39:11.883 --> 39:13.655
But not for food.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.591
What kind of corny ass shit

39:15.621 --> 39:18.088
is that to say!

39:21.727 --> 39:24.866
Jesus Christ, when the hell am I
gonna kiss her?

39:24.896 --> 39:26.868
You know, I still owe you that
kiss.

39:26.898 --> 39:29.571
I know.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.607
What am I, 12?

39:31.637 --> 39:34.676
What are you so nervous about?
So what, she's a woman!

39:34.706 --> 39:38.880
Kissing someone is kissing
someone.

39:38.910 --> 39:42.780
When will you ever get a chance
like this?

39:46.885 --> 39:48.123
Okay, let me think.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.991
When am I going to be able to do
this?

39:50.021 --> 39:54.425
I wonder what kind of a crowd
we're gonna have today?

39:54.726 --> 39:59.034
Okay! That's it, NOW!

39:59.064 --> 40:01.737
Cass, hold on a second,
hold on a second.

40:01.767 --> 40:04.005
What?! I told you I owed you
that kiss.

40:04.035 --> 40:07.576
I know and although this is all
very sexy and everything,

40:07.606 --> 40:11.980
I just need a moment to recover
from this concussion.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.011
Sorry.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.047
No problem.

40:20.552 --> 40:23.988
Now call 911.

40:26.892 --> 40:31.066
Guess what, honey?
I got the job in Miami!

40:31.096 --> 40:34.836
I'll be a professor at the
University of Miami!

40:34.866 --> 40:36.672
Can you believe it?
My dream job!

40:36.702 --> 40:38.139
I'll end up where I
started in Miami,

40:38.169 --> 40:40.208
but I'll be with my family
and friends,

40:40.238 --> 40:41.176
this is too good to be true;

40:41.206 --> 40:43.845
we can buy a house,
we can have our kids--

40:43.875 --> 40:44.880
I'm not going to Miami.

40:44.910 --> 40:47.048
You could get a job on one
of your mom's soaps,

40:47.078 --> 40:49.585
great weather, we can go to the
beach whenever you want to--

40:49.615 --> 40:51.587
What do you mean you're not
going to Miami?

40:51.617 --> 40:53.589
Just what I said, Peter.

40:53.619 --> 41:00.619
You know, I'm so happy for you.
I am ecstatic. That's awesome.

41:00.926 --> 41:02.898
Fantastic, fantastic. But

41:02.928 --> 41:05.166
I'm not going to Miami;
I hate Miami.

41:05.196 --> 41:06.602
Oh, you don't hate Miami.

41:06.632 --> 41:08.770
Peter, don't tell me what I like
or don't like.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.772
I never liked Miami
and you know it.

41:10.802 --> 41:14.275
But it's my dream job!
- Yes, yes.

41:14.305 --> 41:18.843
Yes, it's your dream job, but
not mine.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.717
Besides, there's not guarantee

41:21.747 --> 41:24.285
that my mom can get me job on
one of her soaps.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.188
What am I supposed to do here?
I can't get a job here.

41:27.218 --> 41:31.927
Well, I have a job. As a matter
of fact, I have two jobs.

41:31.957 --> 41:35.631
Oh yeah, right.

41:35.661 --> 41:38.099
Waking up at 3:30
in the morning everyday

41:38.129 --> 41:39.635
to report on the
traffic news.

41:39.665 --> 41:41.002
How will they ever get around
without you?

41:41.032 --> 41:43.004
And the black box theater? Ooh!

41:43.034 --> 41:44.940
C'mon Cass, when are you
going to

41:44.970 --> 41:47.676
let go of this acting thing
and start a family?

41:47.706 --> 41:50.812
When am I going to let go of
this acting thing?

41:50.842 --> 41:54.082
Who the hell are you and what
have you done with my husband?

41:54.112 --> 41:56.685
Peter, you know I have been
acting forever.

41:56.715 --> 41:59.020
Way before we met
and I will continue to act.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.856
Okay?

42:00.886 --> 42:02.658
And besides, macho man,

42:02.688 --> 42:05.160
when are you going to let go of
this 'teacher thing'?

42:05.190 --> 42:07.195
Why is it that I have to let go
of anything?

42:07.225 --> 42:08.864
Why is your job more important
than mine?

42:08.894 --> 42:10.599
C'mon Cass, I didn't mean it
like that.

42:10.629 --> 42:12.763
- Yes, you did.

42:16.134 --> 42:20.671
What the hell do you want me to
do? I can't turn down this job.

42:21.707 --> 42:25.242
You do what you have to do.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.617
There's nothing for me in Miami.
- But what are we going to do?

42:28.647 --> 42:31.649
You're my wife.

42:34.653 --> 42:37.888
Peter...

42:38.056 --> 42:40.328
I think we should talk about
this marriage

42:40.358 --> 42:41.963
and the direction
it's headed.

42:41.993 --> 42:44.995
What are you saying?

43:02.948 --> 43:03.819
I want a divorce.

43:03.849 --> 43:07.055
No. Okay? No.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.657
No.

43:08.687 --> 43:09.725
- Peter.
- No.

43:09.755 --> 43:10.892
- Listen.
- No.

43:10.922 --> 43:12.894
No! No! NO! NO!!!

43:12.924 --> 43:15.363
Peter, we've been arguing
non-stop for two years.

43:15.393 --> 43:17.032
What kind of marriage is this?!

43:17.062 --> 43:19.234
I still love you, Cass! How can
you do this?

43:19.264 --> 43:22.003
We were supposed to spend
the rest of our lives together!

43:22.033 --> 43:24.105
I know, Peter. I still love you
too, but

43:24.135 --> 43:28.777
I think I'm not "in" love with
you anymore. I'm sorry.

43:28.807 --> 43:31.146
Why?

43:31.176 --> 43:33.782
Why? I don't know why?

43:33.812 --> 43:35.784
Because these things happen
sometimes!

43:35.814 --> 43:38.883
People fall out of love
everyday.

43:39.250 --> 43:42.052
Is it the sex?

44:08.046 --> 44:11.753
We haven't had sex in like two
months.

44:11.783 --> 44:14.189
That's because my feelings
are changing, Peter.

44:14.219 --> 44:15.456
There's something else going on.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.726
There's something that you're
not telling me.

44:17.756 --> 44:19.928
Why can't your ego just believe

44:19.958 --> 44:22.063
that I don't feel the same
anymore?

44:22.093 --> 44:26.396
Look, I know there's something
else. I just know it.

44:27.232 --> 44:30.038
Okay, okay.

44:30.068 --> 44:33.341
If you have to know,
you have to know.

44:33.371 --> 44:37.074
You're my best friend,
right?

44:37.308 --> 44:39.480
You'll probably find out anyway.

44:39.510 --> 44:41.482
There's someone else; I knew it.

44:41.512 --> 44:43.484
I knew it!

44:43.514 --> 44:45.186
Who is it?

44:45.216 --> 44:47.422
I'm gonna fucking kill him. That
fucking creep!

44:47.452 --> 44:49.157
Is it that director you're
working with?

44:49.187 --> 44:50.258
I'll just fucking kill him!

44:50.288 --> 44:51.893
I've seen the way he looks
at you.

44:51.923 --> 44:53.494
Don't think that you're
putting one over me.

44:53.524 --> 44:56.331
No! It's not the director!
- Then who is it?!

44:56.361 --> 44:58.433
C'mon! Spit it out.

44:58.463 --> 45:01.465
Who is he?!

45:05.003 --> 45:06.374
It's not a he.

45:06.404 --> 45:09.106
What?!

45:10.541 --> 45:14.044
It's not...

45:14.846 --> 45:15.984
a he.

45:16.014 --> 45:17.152
What do you mean
'it's not a 'he? '

45:17.182 --> 45:19.054
What the hell
does that mean?

45:19.084 --> 45:21.886
It means

45:24.289 --> 45:29.197
it's a she.

45:29.227 --> 45:31.366
Cass, what are you saying?

45:31.396 --> 45:33.769
What do you think I'm saying?

45:33.799 --> 45:35.904
What? Are you telling me that--

45:35.934 --> 45:37.538
Are you fucking lesbian?

45:37.568 --> 45:40.041
Ssh, keep your freaking voice
down!

45:40.071 --> 45:42.878
It's bad enough they have to
listen to all our arguments,

45:42.908 --> 45:44.846
now you're outing me
to the whole neighborhood?

45:44.876 --> 45:45.847
I'm gonna have a nervous
breakdown.

45:45.877 --> 45:47.548
What the hell is
going on?

45:47.578 --> 45:49.017
Cass, you're NOT a lesbian.

45:49.047 --> 45:52.220
I know, I know.
I don't understand it myself.

45:52.250 --> 45:54.555
It's just...these feelings all
of a sudden--

45:54.585 --> 45:58.355
- What? What feelings?

46:00.125 --> 46:02.392
Well,

46:03.261 --> 46:05.000
you know Lola, right?

46:05.030 --> 46:08.403
Yeah, I-- oh my God, you're
having an affair with Lola.

46:08.433 --> 46:10.972
No, no, no. I'm not having an
affair.

46:11.002 --> 46:13.441
Listen to me, Peter. I'm not
having an affair.

46:13.471 --> 46:15.476
That's why I'm telling you this
because

46:15.506 --> 46:16.577
I don't want to
cheat on you Peter,

46:16.607 --> 46:19.948
and I want to end this
relationship with integrity.

46:19.978 --> 46:22.283
Integrity? Is there integrity in
telling me that

46:22.313 --> 46:23.919
all of a sudden,
now you're gay?

46:23.949 --> 46:26.521
Will you stop thinking in
such black and white terms!

46:26.551 --> 46:30.787
For someone with a Ph.d.,
you are so completely ignorant!

46:31.322 --> 46:34.791
So, what is it then? What is it?

46:36.227 --> 46:38.266
I have no idea.

46:38.296 --> 46:41.298
Look, you think
this is easy for me?

46:43.601 --> 46:47.442
I have a million things going on
in my head and

46:47.472 --> 46:50.474
I'm all mixed up.

46:53.544 --> 46:55.583
What I do know,
is that

46:55.613 --> 46:59.454
our relationship ended long
before I met Lola.

46:59.484 --> 47:01.456
You must have seen this coming.

47:01.486 --> 47:04.926
You can be sure of the fact that
I did not see this coming.

47:04.956 --> 47:06.895
Peter, I still love you. No, you
don't. You don't love me.

47:06.925 --> 47:10.060
If you would love me,
you wouldn't be doing this.

47:13.298 --> 47:15.603
How can you do this, Cass?

47:15.633 --> 47:19.474
After all these years,
how can you do this.

47:19.504 --> 47:24.474
Peter, I don't have all the--
I don't have all the answers.

47:25.010 --> 47:27.415
What I do know is that

47:27.445 --> 47:30.447
I have these feelings

47:31.382 --> 47:34.355
I have to go with.
I can't suppress them.

47:34.385 --> 47:37.192
I have to be true to myself.

47:37.222 --> 47:40.891
What about being true to me,
Cass?

47:40.959 --> 47:41.897
This isn't about you.

47:41.927 --> 47:45.395
Of course not,
it's always been about you.

48:00.245 --> 48:03.251
Peter, where are you going?

48:03.281 --> 48:08.552
Wait one second! Can't we just
finish this conversa--

48:17.562 --> 48:22.270
So, he just left?
- Yeah,

48:22.300 --> 48:24.039
he was pretty much in shock

48:24.069 --> 48:26.441
when he thought I might be
with a woman.

48:26.471 --> 48:28.443
Might?

48:28.473 --> 48:31.212
Lola, I don't know what's going
on.

48:31.242 --> 48:36.251
This is so crazy. I have this
massive crush on you, yet

48:36.281 --> 48:40.188
I never really thought of
being with a woman, in that way.

48:40.218 --> 48:42.991
Well, neither did I, until I
did.

48:43.021 --> 48:46.694
I don't know, everybody has
their own experience, but for me

48:46.724 --> 48:49.364
I loved men for a long time.

48:49.394 --> 48:53.001
I loved their bodies, the sex
was great,

48:53.031 --> 48:53.969
but then I found I wasn't

48:53.999 --> 48:57.005
connecting with them anymore,
emotionally.

48:57.035 --> 49:00.208
And I found I was connecting
more with women.

49:00.238 --> 49:02.577
It just evolved into a romantic
thing.

49:02.607 --> 49:05.380
It never started as a physical
attraction.

49:05.410 --> 49:08.183
Yeah, but I have had
emotional connections with men.

49:08.213 --> 49:11.448
Still do. Deep ones.

49:11.582 --> 49:14.389
I just never thought of a woman
sexually.

49:14.419 --> 49:16.724
Except in some crazy
fantasy in my head

49:16.754 --> 49:19.260
where there's this
orgy going on

49:19.290 --> 49:22.430
and everybody's having anonymous
sex with everybody, right?

49:22.460 --> 49:25.166
And it's awesome.

49:25.196 --> 49:27.668
But it's not real.

49:27.698 --> 49:29.670
No,

49:29.700 --> 49:31.506
I never thought of sex
with a woman

49:31.536 --> 49:35.472
in a serious, conscious way.

50:03.634 --> 50:06.307
What do you think you're
doing?

50:06.337 --> 50:08.243
What happened? Are you okay?

50:08.273 --> 50:09.610
Who the hell are you?

50:09.640 --> 50:12.513
Are you okay? Your face.

50:12.543 --> 50:14.515
You look like you've just seen a
ghost.

50:14.545 --> 50:16.284
He's too hot to be a ghost.

50:16.314 --> 50:17.752
Lola?

50:17.782 --> 50:19.220
Let me ask you a quick question,

50:19.250 --> 50:21.222
aren't ghosts supposed to be all

50:21.252 --> 50:25.526
decomposed and uh
decrepit looking?

50:25.556 --> 50:27.528
And all messed up?

50:27.558 --> 50:29.297
Like the way they die.

50:29.327 --> 50:30.565
Like in the Sixth Sense.

50:30.595 --> 50:32.267
When she opened up the cabinets

50:32.297 --> 50:33.601
and you saw the
back of the head.

50:33.631 --> 50:35.803
She opened up the cabinets
and you saw the hole.

50:35.833 --> 50:38.073
Cass, what the hell are you
talking about?

50:38.103 --> 50:40.608
Are you gonna tell her I'm here?
- Shut up!

50:40.638 --> 50:44.279
I didn't say anything.
- No, not you. Listen,

50:44.309 --> 50:47.382
I'll explain everything
tomorrow.

50:47.412 --> 50:48.649
I have to go.

50:48.679 --> 50:50.818
Do you wanna talk about this?

50:50.848 --> 50:53.654
I know you may be a little
freaked out.

50:53.684 --> 50:57.225
Oh my God, what's happening to
me? This is insane!

50:57.255 --> 50:58.859
No, no, you're not insane.

50:58.889 --> 51:01.229
You are just discovering things
about yourself

51:01.259 --> 51:02.630
you didn't know were there.

51:02.660 --> 51:04.865
You can say that again.
- Will you get out of here!

51:04.895 --> 51:06.634
This is my apartment.

51:06.664 --> 51:08.636
No, not you.

51:08.666 --> 51:10.771
Listen, honey,
we have to talk about this.

51:10.801 --> 51:12.773
You don't have to leave all
freaked out.

51:12.803 --> 51:16.177
Lola, I'll explain everything...

51:16.207 --> 51:19.414
everything tomorrow.
Okay? I got to go.

51:19.444 --> 51:21.382
Yeah, but Cass, I'm worried
about you.

51:21.412 --> 51:23.384
This is a big step for you

51:23.414 --> 51:26.421
but I want you to know that
everything is gonna be okay.

51:26.451 --> 51:29.224
I've been through this myself.

51:29.254 --> 51:31.555
Oh no you haven't.

51:43.801 --> 51:45.406
That was freaky.

51:45.436 --> 51:46.874
You're telling me!

51:46.904 --> 51:48.676
I had to sit through
all that making out.

51:48.706 --> 51:49.777
Oh my God!

51:49.807 --> 51:52.780
What the hell are you doing in
my car?

51:52.810 --> 51:55.716
What the hell am I doing
talking to

51:55.746 --> 52:00.550
an imaginary guy
who's totally naked!

52:01.786 --> 52:06.294
Oh my God! Okay, okay, okay.
Okay. Okay. O k a y.

52:06.324 --> 52:09.326
Let me think.

52:11.362 --> 52:14.198
That's not gonna work.

52:14.432 --> 52:16.633
Oh my God.

52:19.270 --> 52:23.678
Oh my God, I'm a schizophrenic
lesbian!

52:23.708 --> 52:27.911
Could there be anything worse?!

52:28.246 --> 52:29.784
I wouldn't start driving, if I
were you.

52:29.814 --> 52:31.819
- Shut up!

52:31.849 --> 52:34.589
I'll do what I wanna do!
- Alright. I'm just saying.

52:34.619 --> 52:36.391
You're not a lesbian,
by the way.

52:36.421 --> 52:37.858
What do I have to do to
make you shut up?!

52:37.888 --> 52:40.395
You're not schizophrenic either.

52:40.425 --> 52:41.862
There's a reason I'm here.

52:41.892 --> 52:45.295
Okay. Okay, okay.

52:45.496 --> 52:47.702
What possible reason

52:47.732 --> 52:50.405
could I have for putting you
here--

52:50.435 --> 52:52.907
ignore him, Cass, just ignore
him!

52:52.937 --> 52:55.343
Okay, that was a little
schizophrenic.

52:55.373 --> 52:57.407
Oh my God.

52:58.876 --> 53:02.517
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay!

53:02.547 --> 53:05.453
Let me humor this whole insane
situation.

53:05.483 --> 53:09.390
Who are you and
why are you in my head?

53:09.420 --> 53:13.223
Isn't it obvious?

53:16.026 --> 53:18.633
Okay, not only do I have a
naked guy who's

53:18.663 --> 53:21.001
apparently, a figment of my
imagination,

53:21.031 --> 53:24.539
but he's also the Dalai Lama!
WHAT...is obvious?

53:24.569 --> 53:27.975
Nothing about what's
happening right now is obvious!

53:28.005 --> 53:31.246
Now, would you put some
clothes on, for Christ's sake!

53:31.276 --> 53:35.345
Put your seat belt on.

54:07.478 --> 54:09.884
What happened?

54:09.914 --> 54:13.650
If at first you don't succeed...

54:18.589 --> 54:24.461
That was amazing.
You are incredible.

54:27.365 --> 54:28.736
Yeah,

54:28.766 --> 54:30.738
yeah, me. Me too.

54:30.768 --> 54:33.770
Amazing.

54:36.707 --> 54:42.016
Cass, what are you doing?
What's up?

54:42.046 --> 54:44.848
Um...

54:44.882 --> 54:46.783
Nothing.

54:46.817 --> 54:48.752
Nothing.

54:56.394 --> 54:58.999
Oh yeah, that actually,

54:59.029 --> 55:00.701
that was amazing.

55:00.731 --> 55:04.472
I never thought sex with a
woman could be that hot.

55:04.502 --> 55:09.009
Well, it does depend on your
partner if you know what I mean.

55:09.039 --> 55:12.547
You know, you do everything I
wish a man would do

55:12.577 --> 55:14.349
but...better.

55:14.379 --> 55:17.852
You know what I can do
that no man can do?

55:17.882 --> 55:19.119
What?

55:19.149 --> 55:22.022
I can go on and on...

55:22.052 --> 55:27.457
The energizer bunny never looked
so good.

56:09.700 --> 56:12.802
SEXUALITY, IS IT IN YOUR HEAD
OR IN YOUR GROIN

56:18.443 --> 56:20.047
I'm in love with a woman.

56:20.077 --> 56:21.878
Okay.

56:22.112 --> 56:24.752
I know, I know, I've only been
with men, how can I be gay--

56:24.782 --> 56:27.021
You're not necessarily gay--
- but it's amazing!

56:27.051 --> 56:29.590
We are so compatible in every
way.

56:29.620 --> 56:31.559
Have you ever felt that?

56:31.589 --> 56:34.161
I feel like I've known her
in another life or something.

56:34.191 --> 56:39.500
Ah, and the sex! Weinstein,
the sex is through the roof.

56:39.530 --> 56:40.901
You haven't told her about me?

56:40.931 --> 56:43.137
Because I've been trying to
ignore you for weeks.

56:43.167 --> 56:44.371
You should've been gone by now.

56:44.401 --> 56:47.742
Why would you ignore me? I told
you I was going on vacation,

56:47.772 --> 56:50.707
you postponed for the last two
months.

56:53.678 --> 56:56.150
I wasn't-- I wasn't talking to
you.

56:56.180 --> 56:59.182
Who were you talking to?

57:01.786 --> 57:04.788
You're gonna laugh.

57:12.630 --> 57:15.069
What is so funny?

57:15.099 --> 57:20.475
I didn't think I'd have to
mention this to you

57:20.505 --> 57:24.708
because I thought he'd be
gone by now, but

57:25.510 --> 57:28.612
every now and then

57:29.614 --> 57:30.951
I'm sorry, you see a what?

57:30.981 --> 57:32.953
A naked guy!
- A naked guy?

57:32.983 --> 57:34.955
I know he's all in my head

57:34.985 --> 57:36.957
but he just...he just pops up

57:36.987 --> 57:39.527
at the most inappropriate
moments.

57:39.557 --> 57:42.062
Is he here now?

57:42.092 --> 57:44.164
Oh yeah.

57:44.194 --> 57:49.036
Letting it all hang out.
You're loving this, aren't you?

57:49.066 --> 57:52.206
In my bedroom,
in my therapist's office,

57:52.236 --> 57:55.042
in my shower--
you have some nerve.

57:55.072 --> 57:57.044
Are you talking to him right
now?

57:57.074 --> 57:59.547
Weinstein, I know he's all in my
head.

57:59.577 --> 58:01.549
I know I'm not crazy but- but-

58:01.579 --> 58:04.785
there he is!
As plain as day,

58:04.815 --> 58:08.718
Naked. Muscular.

58:09.119 --> 58:13.160
Looking as beautiful as ever.
I need a drink, damn it.

58:13.190 --> 58:15.062
Why haven't you told her about
me?

58:15.092 --> 58:17.026
- Why should I?

58:17.094 --> 58:20.735
Okay, you know this is getting
kind of weird. So,

58:20.765 --> 58:23.003
why don't you just tune out

58:23.033 --> 58:26.173
everything else that you might
be perceiving in the world,

58:26.203 --> 58:26.841
alright?

58:26.871 --> 58:30.139
And you just focus in on me.

58:30.741 --> 58:32.212
If you saw what he looked like,

58:32.242 --> 58:33.848
you wouldn't be asking me
to do that.

58:33.878 --> 58:36.880
Just, do it!
- Okay.

58:37.748 --> 58:40.655
So, when do you you see him?

58:40.685 --> 58:42.923
All the time.

58:42.953 --> 58:45.092
Especially when I'm in bed
with Lola.

58:45.122 --> 58:46.594
That's her name,

58:46.624 --> 58:48.863
the woman I'm
having a relationship with now.

58:48.893 --> 58:55.269
So, he shows up
when you're making love

58:55.299 --> 58:57.237
with your female lover.

58:57.267 --> 59:00.575
Now you're expressing your
emotions about her again

59:00.605 --> 59:03.343
and in this very intimate
setting,

59:03.373 --> 59:05.345
and there he is again.

59:05.375 --> 59:09.746
Ah. She's good.

59:13.851 --> 59:17.821
Weinstein, I know what you're
getting at.

59:17.988 --> 59:20.160
I minored in psychology in
college

59:20.190 --> 59:23.230
and I've analyzed enough
characters in scripts to,

59:23.260 --> 59:27.034
no offense,
be a therapist myself.

59:27.064 --> 59:28.669
What am I getting at?

59:28.699 --> 59:29.604
I have no idea.

59:29.634 --> 59:31.271
You know what she's getting at.

59:31.301 --> 59:34.942
Oh my god, how could someone
so gorgeous be so annoying!

59:34.972 --> 59:36.944
Okay, focus.
- Look, I...

59:36.974 --> 59:40.180
Weinstein, I don't feel well.
I need some air.

59:40.210 --> 59:43.150
I'll see you tomorrow. I uh...

59:43.180 --> 59:45.119
our time is almost up, right?

59:45.149 --> 59:47.087
Alright, we're picking up where
we left off.

59:47.117 --> 59:50.720
We need to talk
about the naked guy!

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:05.940
You have got to stop doing that.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:07.842
Why didn't you want to talk
about me Cass?

01:00:07.872 --> 01:00:09.644
Alright, let's do this!
Right here.

01:00:09.674 --> 01:00:11.712
In the middle of the park, in
the middle of the day.

01:00:11.742 --> 01:00:12.546
Bring it on.

01:00:12.576 --> 01:00:15.311
Why don't you wanna
talk about me?

01:00:16.747 --> 01:00:18.185
Because it's hard okay.

01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:21.288
How can I love this woman so
passionately and still want men?

01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:22.923
Because you're bisexual.

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:27.757
Okay, okay, alright already.
So what if I am?

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:29.864
How do I stop the--

01:00:29.894 --> 01:00:32.867
the natural urge of wanting to
be with men

01:00:32.897 --> 01:00:34.869
when I'm with a woman?
- You don't!

01:00:34.899 --> 01:00:36.871
Are you suggesting I cheat on
Lola?

01:00:36.901 --> 01:00:39.306
I'm not suggesting anything.
-Right!

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:41.842
I'm suggesting it!

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:43.944
I feel like a closet
heterosexual.

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:46.681
How do you mean?
- I don't know.

01:00:46.711 --> 01:00:49.717
If I'm having a relationship
with a woman, doesn't that mean

01:00:49.747 --> 01:00:51.719
I'm not supposed to be into men
anymore?

01:00:51.749 --> 01:00:54.751
Not necessarily.

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:58.722
I guess, what I'm really asking
is

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:01.758
how can you be bisexual

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:06.162
and still be monogamous?

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:37.160
Hello? One second.

01:01:39.897 --> 01:01:44.271
Yeah. Yeah, this is she.

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:46.135
Aha.

01:01:46.837 --> 01:01:48.843
What?

01:01:48.873 --> 01:01:50.845
Are you kidding me?

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:56.416
Yes! Absolutely,
absolutely.

01:01:56.446 --> 01:02:01.789
Thank you. Thank you, so much!

01:02:01.819 --> 01:02:04.158
I got the part.
- What?

01:02:04.188 --> 01:02:06.927
Lola, I got the part!
I got the part

01:02:06.957 --> 01:02:08.929
as the lead in the Spanish soap.

01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:11.966
Oh my God! That is amazing.

01:02:11.996 --> 01:02:14.468
I'm so excited.

01:02:14.498 --> 01:02:20.407
You are gonna be a star! I can't
believe how excited I am.

01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:23.477
Oh God!
- What's the matter?

01:02:23.507 --> 01:02:26.480
I'm gonna lose you, I know--
- No!

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:28.916
I can't believe I meet the love
of my life

01:02:28.946 --> 01:02:30.785
and I'm losing you to stardom.

01:02:30.815 --> 01:02:32.552
No!
- Oh my God. Oh my--

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:35.790
What's the matter?
Have a seat, please.

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:40.857
I can't breathe.
Hurry, get me a bag.

01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:49.069
What are you trying to do?
Save me or kill me?

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:51.071
You said get you a bag?

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:54.308
A paper bag! To breathe into!

01:02:54.338 --> 01:02:59.408
Does that even work?
- I don't know, I just need air.

01:02:59.576 --> 01:03:01.882
Calm down.
- Oh, Cass!

01:03:01.912 --> 01:03:05.920
What are we gonna do?
How are we gonna make this last?

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:08.055
You know long distance
relationships never work

01:03:08.085 --> 01:03:11.291
and I love you so much.

01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:13.093
I love you too, Lola.

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:15.595
And nothing's ever gonna change
that.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:18.398
Listen, we'll visit each other
every month,

01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:20.267
talk on the phone
everyday,

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.102
and by the time you know it,
I'm back.

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:25.505
You know Spanish soaps, they
shoot for seven or eight months;

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:26.941
it's like a year long
miniseries,

01:03:26.971 --> 01:03:28.943
except with lots of nudity

01:03:28.973 --> 01:03:31.578
and a baby being left
on the church steps... What?

01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:33.480
Seven or eight months?!

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:37.251
Are you going to be happy for me
or what?

01:03:37.281 --> 01:03:42.085
- I am, I am. Yay!

01:04:05.609 --> 01:04:08.448
Have you told Peter, yet?
- Ugh, Peter? No way!

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:10.550
He doesn't want to have anything
to do with me.

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:12.552
I may call him though, just to
rub it in.

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:15.155
He's not gonna believe I got a
job in Miami.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:17.424
That's where he wanted
both of us to end up.

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:19.994
Chock full of irony, isn't it?
- Totally.

01:04:20.024 --> 01:04:21.996
So,

01:04:22.026 --> 01:04:23.998
are you seeing anyone?

01:04:24.028 --> 01:04:27.501
God sis, you don't waste any
time do you?

01:04:27.531 --> 01:04:29.503
Going right for the good stuff.

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:32.472
What could be more exciting than
sex?

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:35.442
Hmm, you got a point there.

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:37.444
Well,

01:04:37.474 --> 01:04:41.481
I am seeing someone, but

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:44.051
it's in the early stages,

01:04:44.081 --> 01:04:46.653
and we really don't want
anyone to know yet.

01:04:46.683 --> 01:04:49.323
What do you mean,
you don't want anyone to know?

01:04:49.353 --> 01:04:52.126
What's the big secret?
What are you dating, Batman?

01:04:52.156 --> 01:04:53.293
No,

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:56.196
more like

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:58.032
Catwoman?

01:04:58.062 --> 01:05:00.467
You are dating a transvestite?

01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:02.937
Thank god this trip is only two
hours--

01:05:02.967 --> 01:05:06.040
no you weirdo, I'm not dating a
transvestite.

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:09.543
I'm dating...I'm dating a
female.

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:11.640
A female what?

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:12.246
A female kangaroo,
What do you think I'm dating?!

01:05:12.276 --> 01:05:14.314
A female human being!

01:05:14.344 --> 01:05:16.512
Oh!

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:19.548
Oh!

01:05:21.185 --> 01:05:24.253
Oh!

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:36.099
What the hell are you smiling
about?

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:40.140
It's all good, Cass.
- What?

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:42.142
I just didn't think you had it
in you.

01:05:42.172 --> 01:05:45.174
Me?

01:05:45.209 --> 01:05:49.316
I live on the edge, baby.
On the precipice of life.

01:05:49.346 --> 01:05:54.454
Besides, sorry to disappoint you
sis, but I am a free spirit.

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:58.158
I go where the wind takes me.

01:05:58.188 --> 01:06:04.031
I flow, baby. I flow!
-Yeah, you're flowing alright.

01:06:04.061 --> 01:06:07.067
I just didn't think you were the
sexually experimental type.

01:06:07.097 --> 01:06:09.369
That's cause you know nothing
about my sex life.

01:06:09.399 --> 01:06:12.206
Uh, what sex life? The boring
one you had with your husband?

01:06:12.236 --> 01:06:15.142
Or the one you've been
fantasizing about for ages?

01:06:15.172 --> 01:06:19.479
The point is Evette, I'm with a
woman.

01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:21.581
She's incredible.

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:24.751
Plus, I bet you can't say
the same thing for yourself.

01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:27.421
I've done both sexes--
- Don't be so sure.

01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:30.653
I've had relationships
with both-- What?

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:35.162
Evette Manconi, you've been with
a woman?

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:37.164
Well, I haven't exactly been
with a woman.

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:39.399
No, no, no, you've either been
with one or you haven't.

01:06:39.429 --> 01:06:40.600
Now, which is it?

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:42.169
Details! I want details!

01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:44.467
- I am trying to tell you.
Listen.

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:48.542
I was 20 years old. It was my
sophomore year in college.

01:06:48.572 --> 01:06:50.677
Did I have the purple hair then?

01:06:50.707 --> 01:06:54.048
I don't know, was that the year
you only dressed in purple too?

01:06:54.078 --> 01:06:56.279
Yes! Okay, listen,

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.453
sophomore year in college,
twenty years old, purple hair

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:03.052
and I...

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:08.495
kissed my best friend.
- Oh my God!

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:09.829
Did I know her?

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:11.598
No, she was totally goth

01:07:11.628 --> 01:07:14.101
and didn't like being
introduced to other people.

01:07:14.131 --> 01:07:18.538
So, I kissed my best friend
and we...

01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:21.175
slept together.

01:07:21.205 --> 01:07:24.240
Almost!

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:28.448
That's it?

01:07:28.478 --> 01:07:31.251
You almost slept together?

01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:35.255
That is truly the worst lesbian
escapade I have ever heard

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:37.386
in my entire life.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:38.592
What are you talking about? We
were attracted to each other.

01:07:38.622 --> 01:07:39.693
She kissed me.

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:41.861
But you didn't go all the way.
That doesn't count.

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:44.631
What do you mean it doesn't
count? It was exciting.

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:46.233
I mean, I wasn't
into it after that,

01:07:46.263 --> 01:07:48.268
but I'm telling you,
it was thrilling.

01:07:48.298 --> 01:07:49.836
You're pathetic, you know that?

01:07:49.866 --> 01:07:52.339
Do me a favor,
don't tell anyone that story.

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:53.873
It'll shock them into boredom.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:58.745
No, no, we didn't have any
clothes on. Do you understand?

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:01.181
No clothes!

01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:04.518
Big whoop, nudity with
no labial action doesn't count.

01:08:04.548 --> 01:08:07.387
We were drinking and smoking.
She wanted to continue.

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:09.423
Are you kidding me?
Inebriation?!

01:08:09.453 --> 01:08:13.456
Everyone's gay after two drinks.
Everybody knows that!

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:28.371
You think you can help
me out, here?

01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:33.380
Can you believe
he said that to me?!

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:35.715
I wanted to kick him
in his balls!

01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:37.251
So why didn't you?

01:08:37.281 --> 01:08:38.618
Because! Joe wouldn't let me.

01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:40.754
He was afraid the guy would
go after him.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:44.420
Oh my God!

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:49.595
That reminds me of
another story.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:51.827
- Which one?

01:08:52.395 --> 01:08:54.434
The one about the transvestite.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:57.703
Oh, I have a wonderful story
about--

01:08:57.734 --> 01:09:00.303
- Not now, Ma. Not now.

01:09:01.505 --> 01:09:04.506
No ma, it's not that.

01:09:06.376 --> 01:09:09.377
It's just that...

01:09:13.317 --> 01:09:16.319
I have something important
to tell you.

01:09:17.254 --> 01:09:19.888
Yes?

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:23.158
Well...

01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:29.502
It's sort of...

01:09:29.533 --> 01:09:31.404
you see...

01:09:31.435 --> 01:09:32.506
I'm kinda--

01:09:32.536 --> 01:09:33.740
- She's kinda in love
with a woman.

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:36.772
Evette!
- What?

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.876
And?

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:45.319
And...

01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:47.883
that's it.

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:51.457
That kind of news doesn't need
an 'and' Mommy.

01:09:51.488 --> 01:09:55.262
That's definitely the end of a
sentence.

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:59.595
Well...

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:04.467
Well, what? Are you okay?

01:10:05.602 --> 01:10:08.837
I'm thinking.

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:14.881
You know English is not
as easy as Spanish for me. So...

01:10:14.911 --> 01:10:16.516
Speak in Spanish, Ma!

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.752
What are you translating for the
United Nations?

01:10:18.782 --> 01:10:21.484
We speak Spanish too.

01:10:24.288 --> 01:10:29.596
Okay, here it is:

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:32.695
Do you love her?

01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:37.700
Yeah.

01:10:39.369 --> 01:10:42.971
Does she love you?

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:47.710
Yeah. At least she tells me so.

01:10:48.312 --> 01:10:50.484
Does she love Cuban food?

01:10:50.514 --> 01:10:53.387
Almost more than me.

01:10:53.417 --> 01:11:00.417
Does she where guayaberas,
smoke cigars and most important,

01:11:02.492 --> 01:11:04.764
is she a communist?

01:11:04.794 --> 01:11:10.032
None of the above. But,

01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:15.338
she is a democrat.
- Ugh.

01:11:21.044 --> 01:11:26.315
Well, okay. We can work on that.

01:11:28.752 --> 01:11:31.925
Congratulations, Cassanova.

01:11:31.955 --> 01:11:34.728
Thanks.
She sounds wonderful.

01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:37.531
So far. Okay?

01:11:37.561 --> 01:11:38.498
When can I meet...

01:11:38.528 --> 01:11:41.735
- Lola, her
name is Lola. Whenever you want.

01:11:41.765 --> 01:11:44.871
Whenever you come up or when she
comes down to visit, I guess.

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:45.939
Okay, wonderful!

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:48.608
She sounds great Ma.
Cass told me all about her.

01:11:48.638 --> 01:11:51.044
She's an actress, she's a
teacher.

01:11:51.074 --> 01:11:53.913
Oh my goodness, how wonderful!

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:56.450
Miriam's here.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.482
Mommy!

01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:04.824
What ever you do,
do not tell Miriam about Lola.

01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:08.828
And risk another charming
evening with the lovely Sybil?

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:09.996
No thank you.

01:12:10.026 --> 01:12:13.028
No thank you.

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:20.039
Oh Miriam! We've been waiting
for you.

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:25.340
And we've been having such great
conversation.

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:29.716
Were you guys talking about me?

01:12:29.746 --> 01:12:31.017
I'm sure you were talking
about me.

01:12:31.047 --> 01:12:32.452
You're always talking about me.

01:12:32.482 --> 01:12:33.286
Did you forget to take your

01:12:33.316 --> 01:12:35.789
paranoia medication
today, Miriam?

01:12:35.819 --> 01:12:37.891
We were not talking about you.

01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:41.490
There's not enough hours
in the day for that.

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:44.063
- How you doing, Miriam?
- Sure. Whatever.

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:48.001
Hey Miriam, can you believe
I'm gonna be living here again?

01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:50.003
Why?

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:53.172
What do you mean 'why',
space head? I told you,

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:55.675
Cass got a lead in mom's soap.

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:57.977
Don't you ever listen to
anybody else's voice

01:12:58.007 --> 01:13:00.947
besides the ones in your head.

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:03.683
Oh, yeah. That's nice.
- Don't get too excited now.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.018
I said 'congratulations.'

01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:07.086
No. You did not say
'congratulations.'

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:08.354
Did you hear congratulations?

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:10.690
I didn't hear nothing. I didn't
hear 'congratulations' either,

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.659
because if I would've heard
'congratulations', ooh.

01:13:12.689 --> 01:13:14.761
We would have been like,
congratulations!

01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:16.095
Yes! Congratulations!

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:19.628
How uncharacteristically
kind of her!

01:13:21.665 --> 01:13:25.539
Congratulations, Cassanova!
There you heard it!

01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:27.574
You already said it.

01:13:27.604 --> 01:13:28.942
So

01:13:28.972 --> 01:13:31.077
I'll say it a million times

01:13:31.107 --> 01:13:37.746
because I love you and I'm so
proud of you, baby.

01:13:37.847 --> 01:13:41.517
Let me give you a hug.
- No!

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:45.659
Okay, I'm going to freshen up a
bit.

01:13:45.689 --> 01:13:49.596
So you girls continue to battle
'til I get back.

01:13:49.626 --> 01:13:52.628
Have fun!

01:13:54.598 --> 01:13:56.636
I'm gonna go freshen up too.

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:58.638
Thanks a lot.

01:13:58.668 --> 01:14:01.670
See ya!

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.987
- Hello.
- Hello, Lola?

01:14:14.017 --> 01:14:16.189
- Cass!
- Hey! What's up, sweetheart?

01:14:16.219 --> 01:14:17.691
Is this your mom's number?

01:14:17.721 --> 01:14:19.693
Yeah, my cellphone died. How's
it going?

01:14:19.723 --> 01:14:22.596
Everything's fine, but I'm
missing you like crazy.

01:14:22.626 --> 01:14:23.730
This sucks.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.000
I miss you too, but don't worry,
it's only a few months.

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:28.635
We could talk everyday,

01:14:28.665 --> 01:14:30.704
and I could go visit you
every few weeks or so.

01:14:30.734 --> 01:14:32.906
Right, and I'll come down
when I have days off.

01:14:32.936 --> 01:14:34.841
Yeah.

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:36.710
I love you.
- I love you too.

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.712
How's the family?
- They're great.

01:14:38.742 --> 01:14:40.714
They totally understood.

01:14:40.744 --> 01:14:43.617
Really? What did they say?

01:14:43.647 --> 01:14:45.619
You don't own any guayaberas,
do you?

01:14:45.649 --> 01:14:47.887
You mean those cool Cuban shirts

01:14:47.917 --> 01:14:48.922
with the stitching
down the sides?

01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:51.024
I love those shirts.
My dad used to wear them.

01:14:51.054 --> 01:14:53.693
That's fine for your Dad, as
long as you never wear them.

01:14:53.723 --> 01:14:57.631
That's weird. I just heard a
click on the other end.

01:14:57.661 --> 01:14:58.565
What?

01:14:58.595 --> 01:15:00.967
Sweet Jesus,
you're not going to believe

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:03.036
what I just heard on the phone.

01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:04.938
Lola, I just heard a click on
the other end of the phone.

01:15:04.968 --> 01:15:07.874
You were listening to somebody's
conversation on the phone?

01:15:07.904 --> 01:15:10.176
What's wrong with you?
- I didn't do it on purpose.

01:15:10.206 --> 01:15:12.712
I went to make a phone call
and then I...heard it.

01:15:12.742 --> 01:15:13.713
When you pick up the phone

01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:15.782
and you hear somebody
else on the other end,

01:15:15.812 --> 01:15:16.650
You hang up!

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:19.615
But I didn't.
- Well, you should've.

01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:25.888
Shit!
- What? What's happening?

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:30.096
My sister Miriam was listening
to our whole conversation!

01:15:30.126 --> 01:15:33.166
So?
- So? I was saying I love you,

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:35.669
I miss you, I wanna jump your
bones.

01:15:35.699 --> 01:15:37.804
To a woman! She doesn't
know yet.

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:40.674
I'm hanging up.
- No! No, you wait right there.

01:15:40.704 --> 01:15:42.776
Oh God, Lola what am I gonna do?

01:15:42.806 --> 01:15:44.778
Tell her I'm your agent.

01:15:44.808 --> 01:15:49.048
Okay, so I'm having an affair
with my agent

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:51.618
who's still a WOMAN!

01:15:51.648 --> 01:15:53.052
I forgot about that.

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:57.691
Oh, Lord, lordy lord,

01:15:57.721 --> 01:16:00.827
you're not going to believe
what I just heard on the phone.

01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:03.730
What, for Christ's sake? What?!

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.099
Okay. Are you ready?

01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:10.866
Because you're going to
freak out when I tell this.

01:16:12.802 --> 01:16:15.942
Okay, can you spill it, please?

01:16:15.972 --> 01:16:21.043
Our...sister...

01:16:28.985 --> 01:16:30.957
our sister...

01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:32.959
...is a...

01:16:32.989 --> 01:16:35.991
...a le...

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:38.164
...a lesbian!

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:41.196
Okay, I'm ready!

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:44.132
Mommy!

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:47.006
Shit! I got to go.

01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:49.008
I'm jumping into the flames.

01:16:49.038 --> 01:16:51.606
Stop, drop, and roll.

01:16:51.675 --> 01:16:53.279
You're not going to believe

01:16:53.309 --> 01:16:55.081
what I'm going to tell you
about Cassanova!

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:57.083
Shut up. I know already.

01:16:57.113 --> 01:17:00.115
Let's go eat.

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:31.980
Fish is great. How's your steak?
- Great!

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:35.755
This wine. What's the name
of this cabernet?

01:17:35.785 --> 01:17:37.891
I don't know. Ma, what's the
name of this cabernet?

01:17:37.921 --> 01:17:39.358
Nobody tells me anything.

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:41.360
I'm always the last to know
everything.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:44.898
Of course, you all think
I'm some kind of a retard.

01:17:44.928 --> 01:17:46.065
I know what you think.

01:17:46.095 --> 01:17:47.333
You think I can't be trusted.

01:17:47.363 --> 01:17:49.168
Well, you're the ones who can't
be trusted.

01:17:49.198 --> 01:17:51.170
Waiter, can I have
another bottle of this?

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.072
Always the black sheep.
Always the black sheep.

01:17:53.102 --> 01:17:55.775
Ever since I was a little girl,
everyone's hated me.

01:17:55.805 --> 01:17:58.712
This place is really nice, Ma.
Have you been here before?

01:17:58.742 --> 01:18:00.709
Yes, yes...

01:18:00.977 --> 01:18:02.415
I'm the pimple faced one. I'm
the one who takes medication.

01:18:02.445 --> 01:18:04.150
I'm the one who joined the army.

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:07.182
Pass the butter, please.

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:09.856
Thank you.

01:18:09.886 --> 01:18:11.357
How could nobody tell me this?

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:13.492
How could I be the last to know?
How come I never--

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:15.494
You know why we don't tell you
anything?

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:17.726
Because of this!

01:18:17.827 --> 01:18:19.298
This reaction you're having
right now is not normal!

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:21.200
You're acting like it's the end
of the world!

01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:23.436
So what, our sister
is with a woman now.

01:18:23.466 --> 01:18:24.904
Big deal!

01:18:24.934 --> 01:18:28.074
Waiter, can I have a case of
this wine?

01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:30.309
You know what? Maybe I should
try a woman!

01:18:30.339 --> 01:18:33.112
If it's too easy and it's no big
deal, maybe I should, right?

01:18:33.142 --> 01:18:34.814
All the men I've
been with stink,

01:18:34.844 --> 01:18:36.182
so why not give women a try!

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:39.218
Why not? Because you hate
women, Miriam.

01:18:39.248 --> 01:18:42.121
You hate men. Oh wait, that's
not right,

01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:43.890
you hate everybody!

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.259
You kinda have to like people in
order to love them.

01:18:46.289 --> 01:18:47.794
Ya know, it's mandatory!

01:18:47.824 --> 01:18:52.098
Besides, who says I'm gay?!
Who?!

01:18:52.128 --> 01:18:53.366
What did she write?

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:55.397
Don't get me wrong,

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:56.535
I'm not saying any of this
to make you feel any better,

01:18:56.565 --> 01:19:00.239
It's kind of nice seeing you all
discombobulated.

01:19:00.269 --> 01:19:03.977
I've always loved men.
I will continue to love men.

01:19:04.007 --> 01:19:06.145
What I am,
for lack of a better term...

01:19:06.175 --> 01:19:08.848
Don't say it!

01:19:08.878 --> 01:19:10.516
Some people might
not really get it--

01:19:10.546 --> 01:19:11.484
Exactly.

01:19:11.514 --> 01:19:13.052
...until they've been through it
themselves.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:13.920
Don't say it!

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:16.952
But I'm...

01:19:18.955 --> 01:19:20.960
...bisexual.

01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:22.962
Ah! I need to pee.
- Told you not to say it.

01:19:22.992 --> 01:19:25.994
Me too!

01:19:26.195 --> 01:19:28.301
Bisexual?

01:19:28.331 --> 01:19:30.403
What's the matter with you?

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:33.439
She's our sister, you douche!

01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:37.110
Who cares if she's with a woman
now as long as she's happy!

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:39.145
Happiness is not everything, you
know.

01:19:39.175 --> 01:19:40.847
What?

01:19:40.877 --> 01:19:43.316
What are people going to think?

01:19:43.346 --> 01:19:46.085
What people?! You have no
friends!

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:48.888
That's besides the point!

01:19:48.918 --> 01:19:51.424
What if she gets some le...

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:54.193
What if she gets some
lesbian disease, huh?

01:19:54.223 --> 01:19:56.191
Huh?!

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:58.331
What if she starts going to
those uh...whatchahoosit

01:19:58.361 --> 01:20:01.100
clubs on the underground?
- Okay!

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:04.370
If you ever use the word
whatchahoosit ever again,

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.272
I'm gonna cease being related to
you.

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:09.275
Well, what do they call those
clubs?

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:13.847
I'm assuming you mean sex clubs?
-Shh! Shh!

01:20:13.877 --> 01:20:15.614
Like anybody hasn't been
listening.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:17.884
What the hell are you
staring at?

01:20:17.914 --> 01:20:18.952
You've never seen two sisters

01:20:18.982 --> 01:20:23.118
arguing over another sister's
sexuality before?

01:20:23.987 --> 01:20:25.558
I just needed more water.

01:20:25.588 --> 01:20:27.560
Oh, you need some water?

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:30.429
That's fine, I'll get you water.

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:32.431
You want some water? Here.

01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:35.001
Here's some water for you.

01:20:35.031 --> 01:20:38.404
Here's your FUCKIN' water.
You're happy now?

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:41.875
Anybody else fuckin' thirsty?

01:20:41.905 --> 01:20:44.940
I didn't think so.

01:20:46.109 --> 01:20:47.580
I'm leaving.

01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:49.148
Freeze!

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:51.150
Not you, you idiot.

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.618
You listen to me Miriam.

01:20:52.648 --> 01:20:56.222
It's 'the' underground, not
'on' the underground, you dork!

01:20:56.252 --> 01:20:59.192
And just in case you missed
that PBS special on STD's,

01:20:59.222 --> 01:21:01.160
there are no known diseases
you can get

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:03.096
solely from sleeping
with women,

01:21:03.126 --> 01:21:07.295
otherwise, all heterosexual men
would be infected!

01:21:07.997 --> 01:21:12.138
Well, I may not understand about
homosexuals or bisexuals,

01:21:12.168 --> 01:21:14.908
but what I do know is that
you... you're vulgar!

01:21:14.938 --> 01:21:17.039
You're vulgar!

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:18.644
Always have been. You tell me,
which one is worse.

01:21:18.674 --> 01:21:21.214
Oh my god, universe, can you
please help me?

01:21:21.244 --> 01:21:24.350
Who the hell are you and can I
exchange you without a receipt?

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.552
Lilian Canto, is that your
mother?

01:21:26.582 --> 01:21:30.618
Shut up!
Gimme the keys, I'm driving!

01:21:34.123 --> 01:21:36.095
Excuse me, please.

01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:39.265
Can I have your attention,
please for a moment?

01:21:39.295 --> 01:21:40.333
Thank you very much.

01:21:40.363 --> 01:21:43.937
I would like to apologize
on behalf of my sister.

01:21:43.967 --> 01:21:46.969
The bisexual one?

01:23:15.424 --> 01:23:17.563
You know I was this close to
getting Burn Notice.

01:23:17.593 --> 01:23:19.565
I love that show.

01:23:19.595 --> 01:23:22.597
Go over there.

01:23:22.765 --> 01:23:27.506
That was fun. You were great, as
usual.

01:23:27.536 --> 01:23:29.175
So were you, thank you.

01:23:29.205 --> 01:23:32.045
Cassanova, we need you in
wardrobe. Scene 23 coming up.

01:23:32.075 --> 01:23:34.047
Ok, thanks, I'll be right there.

01:23:34.077 --> 01:23:36.049
So you coming to my party
tonight?

01:23:36.079 --> 01:23:39.252
I don't know. I'm gonna be so
beat after today.

01:23:39.282 --> 01:23:42.221
C'mon Cass, you haven't been to
one of my parties

01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:43.522
since we started
working together.

01:23:43.552 --> 01:23:45.524
And it's been four months.

01:23:45.554 --> 01:23:48.494
I know, and you make it hard

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:52.498
for a girl to say no,
if you know what I mean.

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:56.402
Uh, is that supposed to be
your Mae West impression?

01:23:56.432 --> 01:23:58.737
No?
- Maybe?

01:23:58.767 --> 01:23:59.572
Just a little--

01:23:59.602 --> 01:24:01.607
- Cass, we need
you in wardrobe now.

01:24:01.637 --> 01:24:03.609
Okay, okay!

01:24:03.639 --> 01:24:06.608
So you coming to my party?

01:24:07.576 --> 01:24:11.184
Okay, but only if you dance!

01:24:11.214 --> 01:24:14.216
How's this?

01:24:15.584 --> 01:24:17.790
Now that's way worse than
my Mae West!

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:20.326
I know. I know. See, I got the
hips and the... I know, I know

01:24:20.356 --> 01:24:22.095
I got the hips going-
- No.

01:24:22.125 --> 01:24:24.263
Look, I was the Salsa King in
college.

01:24:24.293 --> 01:24:26.832
Yeah right, where'd you
go to college, Iowa?

01:24:26.862 --> 01:24:30.532
Keep working on it. See ya
tonight.

01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:40.646
So, you and Jose are a thing,
huh? What?

01:24:40.676 --> 01:24:44.479
No!
- What are you doing?

01:24:45.181 --> 01:24:47.653
You have to stop doing that.

01:24:47.683 --> 01:24:49.555
I don't know what you're doing
but

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:53.788
I just wanna turn around and
look for a horse and carriage.

01:24:55.158 --> 01:24:58.497
Cass, I know you and Jose
have a thing for each other.

01:24:58.527 --> 01:25:00.866
Subi! We've only gone out a
couple of times.

01:25:00.896 --> 01:25:02.868
Seven times.

01:25:02.898 --> 01:25:04.870
Seven? He told you seven times?

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.169
In two months.

01:25:07.236 --> 01:25:08.474
He's keeping count? What are we
in seventh grade?

01:25:08.504 --> 01:25:10.605
- Apparently!

01:25:10.806 --> 01:25:12.245
You have not even kissed him yet
and it's been seven times!

01:25:12.275 --> 01:25:13.679
Alright. Alright.

01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:16.582
Enough with the Cassanova Canto
Exposed Report.

01:25:16.612 --> 01:25:17.516
I gotta go get ready.

01:25:17.546 --> 01:25:19.552
Alright, but you know what, if I
were you,

01:25:19.582 --> 01:25:20.886
I'd be tapping that shit.

01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:23.885
Yeah, well, it's not you, okay?

01:25:25.521 --> 01:25:28.523
He's so hot.

01:26:53.909 --> 01:26:56.649
I'm doing
cinematography on this movie,

01:26:56.679 --> 01:27:00.653
but I used to love
photography.

01:27:00.683 --> 01:27:04.952
Especially when I photographed
all the beautiful models!

01:27:05.521 --> 01:27:08.327
Oh yeah!
I'd miss that too!

01:27:08.357 --> 01:27:10.796
Being surrounded by all those
beautiful women.

01:27:10.826 --> 01:27:12.498
What could be better?

01:27:12.528 --> 01:27:14.900
What did the male models look
like?

01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:16.702
- WHO CARES!

01:27:16.732 --> 01:27:20.673
It's just a
matter of time, baby.

01:27:20.703 --> 01:27:23.409
You like that
primal, thrusting action,

01:27:23.439 --> 01:27:25.411
but once you've been with a
woman,

01:27:25.441 --> 01:27:26.979
you'll never go back.

01:27:27.009 --> 01:27:28.714
Honey, he can say he's straight

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:30.983
around his women and
the men on the down-low

01:27:31.013 --> 01:27:33.852
but eventually, he's gonna have
to admit that he's gay.

01:27:33.882 --> 01:27:34.520
Live the life.

01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:36.722
But couldn't he be bisexual?

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:39.592
Pobrecita, no!

01:27:39.622 --> 01:27:42.695
Bisexuality is the last stop
before Homoville.

01:27:42.725 --> 01:27:44.463
One stop to homoville.

01:27:44.493 --> 01:27:46.365
Yeah, all the
bisexual people I know

01:27:46.395 --> 01:27:49.034
are constantly cheating on
their spouses!

01:27:49.064 --> 01:27:52.505
Couldn't he be a bisexual
monogamist?

01:27:52.535 --> 01:27:54.507
What the hell is that?

01:27:54.537 --> 01:27:58.010
Everyone's bisexual until
they're gay.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.808
They literally
asked me to join them!

01:28:01.677 --> 01:28:05.384
It was me and
the two chicks in bed!

01:28:05.414 --> 01:28:08.421
It was awesome! C'mon baby,
threesomes rock!

01:28:08.451 --> 01:28:11.457
All these hot chicks that are
into women all of a sudden,

01:28:11.487 --> 01:28:13.426
It's just 'cause they haven't
found the right guy.

01:28:13.456 --> 01:28:14.860
But wait, wait,

01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:18.364
what if you love women and men
at the same time?

01:28:18.394 --> 01:28:19.998
That's what I mean, babe.

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:22.000
Me and two women

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:25.032
AT THE SAME TIME!

01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:27.873
In the end you wanna be
held by a man.

01:28:27.903 --> 01:28:30.609
Eventually you
have to choose.

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:34.075
Eventually you have
to choose.

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:42.750
I was wondering where you were.
Are you okay?

01:29:34.903 --> 01:29:37.905
Cass?
- Yeah.

01:29:43.979 --> 01:29:46.018
What?
- Where you going?

01:29:46.048 --> 01:29:48.487
I thought I'd take you to
breakfast

01:29:48.517 --> 01:29:51.990
and then to that nice exhibit
you've been wanting to see.

01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:56.094
Yeah but I gotta...I gotta work.

01:29:56.124 --> 01:29:58.931
It's Sunday.

01:29:58.961 --> 01:30:02.063
I mean...

01:30:03.065 --> 01:30:06.067
I got a lot of things to do.

01:30:09.004 --> 01:30:11.773
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:30:48.677 --> 01:30:51.746
Where the hell were
you last night? Shut up!

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:12.605
Voicemail.
Voicemail.

01:31:12.635 --> 01:31:14.607
Hey!

01:31:14.637 --> 01:31:17.876
Lola, I was really hoping I
could talk to you this morning.

01:31:17.906 --> 01:31:20.278
You never answer your phone.

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:23.616
I really have something
important to tell you.

01:31:23.646 --> 01:31:25.618
Where are you?

01:31:25.648 --> 01:31:28.854
Hold on a second...

01:31:28.884 --> 01:31:30.856
I have to answer the door.

01:31:30.886 --> 01:31:33.888
Surprise!

01:31:37.259 --> 01:31:41.967
Look at this place. I feel like
a poor kid, adopt me.

01:31:41.997 --> 01:31:46.204
Cass! You are so surprised! I
love it!

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:48.206
You didn't know I was coming,
did ya?

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:50.042
No idea.

01:31:50.072 --> 01:31:52.845
I was so good. I am not
usually good at this,

01:31:52.875 --> 01:31:55.581
but you got to admit, this was
good.

01:31:55.611 --> 01:31:56.649
- Too good.

01:31:56.679 --> 01:31:58.651
Look at this place! Oh my God,

01:31:58.681 --> 01:32:00.152
It's as big as a church

01:32:00.182 --> 01:32:03.722
and lord knows I haven't been
there in ages.

01:32:03.752 --> 01:32:07.626
Wait, wait, take one.
Resplendent.

01:32:07.656 --> 01:32:10.328
How are you, sweetie!

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:12.130
Listen, I only have three days.

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:14.032
I figured, we could make the
most of it.

01:32:14.062 --> 01:32:16.334
We could go to the beaches
and just hang out.

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:18.036
I missed you so much.

01:32:18.066 --> 01:32:21.707
Ooh, is that your mom?
- I don't know.

01:32:21.737 --> 01:32:25.807
Let's go find out.
- She'd have her keys.

01:32:31.179 --> 01:32:33.318
Hola!

01:32:33.348 --> 01:32:35.320
This is gonna be fun.

01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:38.757
Why did you slam the door like
that?

01:32:38.787 --> 01:32:40.759
It was a package.

01:32:40.789 --> 01:32:44.362
Just leave the package by
the doorstep sir! Thank you!

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:47.900
Cass, what are you talking
about? It's me! Let me in!

01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:52.934
Cass, why are you acting so
weird? Just open the door.

01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:56.709
Do you know him?
- Yes!

01:32:56.739 --> 01:32:59.741
Come on in.
- Thanks.

01:33:03.946 --> 01:33:07.152
Hi, I'm Lola, Cass' partner.

01:33:07.182 --> 01:33:11.089
I'm Jose. Now before I
tell you who I am,

01:33:11.119 --> 01:33:14.059
did you mean partner like in
business or...

01:33:14.089 --> 01:33:15.260
No, no, no, no.
Lovers.

01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:18.363
No, not business partners.
It's kinda tricky these days.

01:33:18.393 --> 01:33:22.701
Yeah, it's even trickier when
you also have a boyfriend.

01:33:22.731 --> 01:33:24.369
I'm Cass' boyfriend.

01:33:24.399 --> 01:33:27.239
And the Oscar for 'Female In
Most Painfully Awkward,

01:33:27.269 --> 01:33:30.375
Yet Utterly Entertaining
Situation' goes to...

01:33:30.405 --> 01:33:32.244
I told you to keep quiet.

01:33:32.274 --> 01:33:34.146
He's not my boyfriend!
- Oh no?

01:33:34.176 --> 01:33:35.881
Well, he seems to disagree.

01:33:35.911 --> 01:33:38.083
Cass c'mon, we've been
seeing each other

01:33:38.113 --> 01:33:39.217
for a couple of
months now.

01:33:39.247 --> 01:33:42.187
And the grave
digger digs deeper...

01:33:42.217 --> 01:33:44.923
Cass, is this true?

01:33:44.953 --> 01:33:46.191
How could you do this?

01:33:46.221 --> 01:33:48.360
You never told me you were in a
relationship.

01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:50.324
Yeah, Cass,

01:33:50.525 --> 01:33:51.363
why didn't you tell either one
of them what was going on?

01:33:51.393 --> 01:33:54.767
Well, somebody's gonna have to
leave.

01:33:54.797 --> 01:33:56.969
Yes, someone should leave.

01:33:56.999 --> 01:33:59.934
Pffft, I'm not leaving.

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:01.940
Bye now.

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:04.972
CASS!

01:34:15.017 --> 01:34:20.387
Jose, can I talk to you
tomorrow, please?

01:34:21.389 --> 01:34:24.926
Fine, but I'm calling you
manana.

01:34:25.894 --> 01:34:29.130
Jose!

01:34:30.165 --> 01:34:32.404
Fuck Cass, what did you do?!
- I didn't do anything.

01:34:32.434 --> 01:34:35.808
Did you cheat on me, with a man?

01:34:35.838 --> 01:34:38.840
What?!

01:34:41.176 --> 01:34:44.216
Lola, what are you doing? No,
wait.

01:34:44.246 --> 01:34:48.220
Please! We can...we can work
this out.

01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:51.223
I don't know what happened.
I don't understand it myself.

01:34:51.253 --> 01:34:55.393
Sometimes, I can't do this total
gay thing.

01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:57.395
Sometimes I miss men.

01:34:57.425 --> 01:34:59.031
It's just not the way I'm built.

01:34:59.061 --> 01:35:02.234
You know how people say, how can
I come out of the closet?

01:35:02.264 --> 01:35:04.336
How can I come out of the
closet, when I've never been in?

01:35:04.366 --> 01:35:10.204
Look, what I do know is that I'm
in love with you.

01:35:10.873 --> 01:35:13.912
You're the only one I ever
really want to be with,

01:35:13.942 --> 01:35:16.148
You're the only person who can
help me through this.

01:35:16.178 --> 01:35:19.384
Listen to me Cass, I'm only
gonna say this once.

01:35:19.414 --> 01:35:21.386
You are bisexual.

01:35:21.416 --> 01:35:23.388
And there's nothing wrong with
it.

01:35:23.418 --> 01:35:25.190
You are neither gay
nor straight,

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:27.793
no matter what anybody says.

01:35:27.823 --> 01:35:32.197
This is who you are!
You have to get used to it.

01:35:32.227 --> 01:35:35.768
Stop caring about all these
labels!

01:35:35.798 --> 01:35:37.335
Lola, please!

01:35:37.365 --> 01:35:39.838
We need labels! Be realistic!

01:35:39.868 --> 01:35:42.240
Otherwise, how would anybody
know what to do with those

01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:43.876
little soap balls in the
baskets,

01:35:43.906 --> 01:35:46.344
little soap pellets you put
in the bathtub when you...

01:35:46.374 --> 01:35:48.113
Shut up, Cass!

01:35:48.143 --> 01:35:50.115
Look,

01:35:50.145 --> 01:35:56.317
I wanna be monogamous.
I like being in a relationship.

01:35:58.086 --> 01:36:00.158
How am I supposed to choose?

01:36:00.188 --> 01:36:04.062
The choice is love, Cass.

01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:05.197
But that's all over now.

01:36:05.227 --> 01:36:06.364
Holy crap, it's my mom.

01:36:06.394 --> 01:36:08.133
Just keep it down for a second.

01:36:08.163 --> 01:36:12.037
No! Fuck you and fuck the horse
you rode in on! Fuck it all!

01:36:12.067 --> 01:36:14.039
Wait, just wait one second,
okay?

01:36:14.069 --> 01:36:16.041
Hi Mommy!

01:36:16.071 --> 01:36:18.043
Hi Cass!

01:36:18.073 --> 01:36:21.013
Just wait one second, please.

01:36:21.043 --> 01:36:23.816
Mom, this is Lola.

01:36:23.846 --> 01:36:26.118
Lola?

01:36:26.148 --> 01:36:28.220
This is Lilia, my mom.

01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:31.824
Hi Ms. Canto, it's nice to
finally meet you.

01:36:31.854 --> 01:36:34.960
Me too. I am very glad to meet
you.

01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:36.494
Cass was telling me everything--

01:36:36.524 --> 01:36:37.529
Excuse me, Mrs. Canto,

01:36:37.559 --> 01:36:40.532
I'm really sorry,
but I have a plane to catch.

01:36:40.562 --> 01:36:43.364
Don't ever call me again!

01:36:52.074 --> 01:36:56.010
She's nice.

01:37:54.269 --> 01:37:57.943
Mamita, do
you want to talk about it?

01:37:57.973 --> 01:38:02.214
No ma, I just want to be left
alone.

01:38:02.244 --> 01:38:03.581
Dinner's ready.

01:38:03.611 --> 01:38:06.351
I'm not hungry.

01:38:06.381 --> 01:38:10.051
I made croquetas.

01:38:20.996 --> 01:38:25.166
Okay, maybe just one.

01:41:06.394 --> 01:41:09.096
Good morning!

01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:36.761
Thanks.

01:41:36.791 --> 01:41:40.532
Jesus, is this economy ever
gonna recover?

01:41:40.562 --> 01:41:45.599
I hope so. People are losing
their jobs, left and right.

01:41:48.703 --> 01:41:51.272
Thank you.

01:41:52.307 --> 01:41:54.812
She's not talking to me, you
know.

01:41:54.842 --> 01:41:57.549
She's not talking to me either.

01:41:57.579 --> 01:41:59.551
You just got here.

01:41:59.581 --> 01:42:02.583
Still.

01:42:10.625 --> 01:42:13.894
I miss her so much, Weinstein.

01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:18.365
I don't know what to do.

01:42:19.334 --> 01:42:21.206
And I know I can't cheat on her
again.

01:42:21.236 --> 01:42:24.238
No you can't.

01:42:24.339 --> 01:42:27.541
We're perfect for each other,
you know.

01:42:27.742 --> 01:42:31.312
We love the same movies, we

01:42:32.414 --> 01:42:34.752
laugh at the same things,

01:42:34.782 --> 01:42:36.454
You know how hard it is

01:42:36.484 --> 01:42:39.920
to find somebody you're
completely compatible with?

01:42:40.222 --> 01:42:42.723
Yes, I do.

01:42:44.659 --> 01:42:46.931
Love isn't supposed to be this
complicated.

01:42:46.961 --> 01:42:52.504
The last time I was in love,
it was so clear, you know, here.

01:42:52.534 --> 01:42:55.207
This time,

01:42:55.237 --> 01:42:59.377
I'm just as in love, but it's
different.

01:42:59.407 --> 01:43:02.409
How so?

01:43:04.779 --> 01:43:06.684
Can't you just

01:43:06.714 --> 01:43:09.854
answer a question that doesn't
start with a question?

01:43:09.884 --> 01:43:12.290
Aren't you getting paid enough?

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:17.291
One answer, Weinstein. Just one.

01:43:18.326 --> 01:43:20.598
Okay.

01:43:20.628 --> 01:43:22.334
How's this?

01:43:22.364 --> 01:43:25.637
I can't help you with the
what happens out there.

01:43:25.667 --> 01:43:29.307
All I can do here, without the
distractions from out there,

01:43:29.337 --> 01:43:31.976
is help you with what you're
feeling.

01:43:32.006 --> 01:43:33.578
Straight, gay, bi,

01:43:33.608 --> 01:43:37.615
all of those are just labels
to make people feel safe.

01:43:37.645 --> 01:43:39.251
Make 'em try and understand

01:43:39.281 --> 01:43:42.720
something they can't or won't
understand.

01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:43.688
That's okay.

01:43:43.718 --> 01:43:47.425
But in here, you don't need
those labels.

01:43:47.455 --> 01:43:49.761
You're always going to be
attracted to people.

01:43:49.791 --> 01:43:51.963
Let's just put aside, for a
second

01:43:51.993 --> 01:43:54.832
the fact that it's both genders
for you, okay?

01:43:54.862 --> 01:43:58.570
You either want to be in a
faithful relationship

01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:01.234
or you don't.

01:44:01.503 --> 01:44:04.438
Fidelity is a choice.

01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:08.713
I think we're gonna have to
continue this next week.

01:44:08.743 --> 01:44:10.677
Okay.

01:44:19.687 --> 01:44:22.323
But Weinstein,

01:44:22.957 --> 01:44:26.030
what am I gonna do?

01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:29.367
Just remember what I told you.

01:44:29.397 --> 01:44:32.036
Who you are isn't defined by
your sexuality

01:44:32.066 --> 01:44:35.440
or by the labels other people
put on you.

01:44:35.470 --> 01:44:40.006
In the end, love trumps all of
that.

01:44:46.481 --> 01:44:48.019
So here I
am.

01:44:48.049 --> 01:44:50.751
At a crossroads of some sort.

01:44:50.818 --> 01:44:53.958
I really love to love, you know.

01:44:53.988 --> 01:44:57.595
I've learned, you should never
be afraid to take that leap,

01:44:57.625 --> 01:44:59.431
to try something new,

01:44:59.461 --> 01:45:04.331
no matter how scary or
unimaginable it seems to be.

01:45:04.766 --> 01:45:07.801
No matter what all the sides
think.

01:45:08.403 --> 01:45:10.342
You know, an acting teacher
told me once,

01:45:10.372 --> 01:45:12.877
you have to take risks on stage,

01:45:12.907 --> 01:45:16.013
and even though the choices may
not always be the right ones,

01:45:16.043 --> 01:45:19.083
you not only have fun trying,
but in the end,

01:45:19.113 --> 01:45:22.754
you always learn something
about the character.

01:45:22.784 --> 01:45:27.020
I guess Professor Stewart wasn't
just talking about acting.

01:45:27.855 --> 01:45:30.728
David! David!

01:45:30.758 --> 01:45:33.760
Hey!
- Hey!

01:45:34.896 --> 01:45:37.569
How are you?
- Good, how are you?

01:45:37.599 --> 01:45:39.571
You look great.
- So do you.

01:45:39.601 --> 01:45:41.573
Thank you.

01:45:41.603 --> 01:45:44.609
Look, I'm sorry I talked
your ear off last night.

01:45:44.639 --> 01:45:46.744
Oh, that's okay. You had a lot
to say.

01:45:46.774 --> 01:45:48.746
Yeah, but two hours? ?

01:45:48.776 --> 01:45:51.649
Three.

01:45:51.679 --> 01:45:56.116
Listen, I...I...
No, you go ahead.

01:45:59.687 --> 01:46:03.457
I just need some time.

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:08.933
She really threw me for a loop,
you know.

01:46:08.963 --> 01:46:11.636
And I get that.

01:46:11.666 --> 01:46:15.440
Cass, we can take all the time
you need.

01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:18.472
I just like being with you.

01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:20.945
I just like being with you too.

01:46:20.975 --> 01:46:23.977
Good.

01:47:03.685 --> 01:47:06.119
Fuck.

01:47:06.854 --> 01:47:10.762
Lola!
-Cass.

01:47:10.792 --> 01:47:14.699
It's so great seeing you.
- It's great seeing you.

01:47:14.729 --> 01:47:18.035
Feels like ages.

01:47:18.065 --> 01:47:21.067
You look fantastic.

01:47:24.839 --> 01:47:28.680
Well, I feel like hell.

01:47:28.710 --> 01:47:32.813
I haven't been sleeping much. I
had these,

01:47:33.648 --> 01:47:35.620
roommates

01:47:35.650 --> 01:47:40.821
that kept me up all night.

01:47:44.125 --> 01:47:46.163
David! David!

01:47:46.193 --> 01:47:48.666
Lola, this is David. David, this
is Lola.

01:47:48.696 --> 01:47:50.864
Pleasure meeting you.

01:47:51.098 --> 01:47:52.904
So you're the famous Lola? - Oh,
I haven't done anything big.

01:47:52.934 --> 01:47:55.106
I mainly do theater,
commercials-

01:47:55.136 --> 01:47:57.509
No, no. He knows.

01:47:57.539 --> 01:47:59.544
I've told him about you.

01:47:59.574 --> 01:48:01.713
I hope she didn't give you
the gory details.

01:48:01.743 --> 01:48:04.845
No, just the sexy stuff.

01:48:05.079 --> 01:48:07.752
David, can you give us a second.
- Oh sure.

01:48:07.782 --> 01:48:10.054
Lola, if you wanna
come to lunch with us,

01:48:10.084 --> 01:48:12.152
we are just grabbing a
bite.

01:48:12.219 --> 01:48:15.292
Oh thanks, David but...
- Just one second, please.

01:48:15.322 --> 01:48:17.529
He's cute.

01:48:17.559 --> 01:48:20.561
He looks so familiar.

01:48:21.095 --> 01:48:23.000
You don't know the half of it.

01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:25.069
How long have you been with him?

01:48:25.099 --> 01:48:27.071
Not long.

01:48:27.101 --> 01:48:30.103
You're living in Hoboken now?

01:48:31.072 --> 01:48:33.574
Yeah.

01:48:36.978 --> 01:48:39.580
I miss you Lola.

01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:46.519
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

01:48:48.089 --> 01:48:50.857
I'm miserable.

01:48:51.593 --> 01:48:56.167
Cass, you devastated me.

01:48:56.197 --> 01:48:57.635
Lola,

01:48:57.665 --> 01:49:02.669
I'm truly, truly sorry.

01:49:04.672 --> 01:49:08.274
I just wish we could
start over again, ya know.

01:49:08.776 --> 01:49:12.750
I admit we did start a little
too quickly.

01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:14.981
Too quickly?

01:49:15.282 --> 01:49:17.154
Lola, I moved into your place

01:49:17.184 --> 01:49:19.156
two weeks after I left my
husband.

01:49:19.186 --> 01:49:20.291
Hindu arranged marriages

01:49:20.321 --> 01:49:23.628
have more 'get to know
each other time' than we did.

01:49:23.658 --> 01:49:26.660
Yeah, but what about him?

01:49:27.194 --> 01:49:28.962
Him?

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:32.933
Baby steps?

01:49:32.967 --> 01:49:35.201
Lola, baby steps.

01:49:36.037 --> 01:49:37.909
C'mon,

01:49:37.939 --> 01:49:40.106
I know you're hungry.

01:49:41.042 --> 01:49:42.146
David!

01:49:42.176 --> 01:49:44.745
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:49:44.946 --> 01:49:48.048
Where have I seen you before?

01:49:49.305 --> 01:49:55.205
