00:02.219 --> 00:03.307
<i>- Previously,
on "Paris in Love"...</i>

00:03.351 --> 00:04.613
<i>This is my first
big performance</i>

00:04.656 --> 00:06.832
<i>back in Vegas
since the pandemic.</i>

00:06.876 --> 00:08.834
<i>As a teenager,
all my parents would do</i>

00:08.878 --> 00:10.314
<i>was try to get me
out of the clubs,</i>

00:10.358 --> 00:12.273
<i>and years later,
I've proved them wrong</i>

00:12.316 --> 00:14.536
and basically invented
getting paid to party.

00:16.190 --> 00:17.974
Carter's been speaking to,
like,

00:18.018 --> 00:19.454
the head of Dorchester Group.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.891
- He's got his mitts
in everything.

00:21.934 --> 00:25.025
I'm the mother.
This is, like, my wedding too.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.330
<i>- I love my mom,
but I don't know</i>

00:26.374 --> 00:28.071
how she's gotten it
into her mind

00:28.115 --> 00:30.900
that my wedding is her wedding.

00:30.943 --> 00:33.120
- Why are you worried?
- I just get nervous.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.860
I love DJing.
I love performing.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.079
I know, when I have a family,

00:36.123 --> 00:37.689
I'm not gonna be able
to do all that.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.909
There's so many changes.
Getting a new home,

00:39.952 --> 00:42.433
<i>about to get married,
planning a family.</i>

00:42.477 --> 00:44.696
All of this, at once.
It's a lot.

00:44.740 --> 00:48.700
<i>♪ I feel good,
I feel good ♪</i>

00:48.744 --> 00:52.748
<i>♪ I blame you,
I blame you ♪</i>

00:52.791 --> 00:56.708
<i>♪ I feel good,
I feel good ♪</i>

00:56.752 --> 00:59.755
<i>♪ I blame you</i>

01:03.976 --> 01:06.544
<i>- ♪ It's you and me
and we know ♪</i>

01:06.588 --> 01:08.503
<i>♪ Everything we need</i>

01:08.546 --> 01:11.506
<i>♪ Is here with you and me</i>

01:11.549 --> 01:14.030
<i>- ♪ To the highs and lows</i>

01:14.074 --> 01:16.598
<i>♪ No matter where we go</i>

01:18.426 --> 01:19.775
- Which pan do you want?
That one or that?

01:21.342 --> 01:22.734
- Anything--
all of them.

01:22.778 --> 01:25.346
I could just cook
everything at once.

01:27.261 --> 01:29.828
Ew. Sick.
- What are you doing?

01:29.872 --> 01:32.179
- Like, see this little white,
weird thing?

01:32.222 --> 01:34.746
How disgusting is that?
Is that like...

01:34.790 --> 01:36.705
the sperm that's, like,
didn't turn into--

01:36.748 --> 01:37.836
- I don't think it's--
- Or is it

01:37.880 --> 01:39.055
the little, baby chickie?

01:39.099 --> 01:40.578
- No, no, no.
- That little white thing.

01:40.622 --> 01:41.797
- I think it's just--
Okay, put the eggs down.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.451
- Ew.
- I think it's just the egg.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.192
I think it's just the egg.
- I always get that part out.

01:45.235 --> 01:47.977
Like, if I eat that little,
squiggly, weird--

01:48.020 --> 01:50.240
- The good news is, everything
you cook for breakfast

01:50.284 --> 01:52.199
is a child's dream.

01:52.242 --> 01:53.330
- I know.
- French toast,

01:53.374 --> 01:54.766
Mickey Mouse pancakes.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.900
I'll be sitting
at the kitchen table, working.

01:57.943 --> 02:00.772
Cute, little kids are

02:00.816 --> 02:03.340
maybe on their screens
watching cartoons.

02:03.384 --> 02:04.646
- I want them to have
so much fun

02:04.689 --> 02:06.517
that they don't even want
to be on the phone.

02:06.561 --> 02:09.346
- The real question is,
are they gonna have TikToks

02:09.390 --> 02:11.348
when they turn nine,
or are we gonna ban 'em

02:11.392 --> 02:13.263
from whatever the next version

02:13.307 --> 02:16.266
-- of Myspace/
- Facebook/
- TikTok/
Instagram is?

02:17.702 --> 02:19.226
- That's literally
the last thing I would want

02:19.269 --> 02:22.185
for my daughter, like, being
an influencer in this world.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.796
I just think it's so toxic.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.189
Of course,
there's the good and the bad,

02:26.233 --> 02:28.017
but a lot of it
is just really bad.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.237
- They're gonna be like,
"Mom, you're the original,

02:30.280 --> 02:31.803
"OG social media influencer.

02:31.847 --> 02:33.675
This is so unfair."

02:33.718 --> 02:35.111
And then do you remember
what you did

02:35.155 --> 02:38.027
when your mom told you
you couldn't do something?

02:38.070 --> 02:39.768
- Did it.
- Exactly.

02:39.811 --> 02:41.030
Herein lies the problem.

02:41.073 --> 02:43.728
- I hope that she's a nerd,
like her dad.

02:43.772 --> 02:46.470
- No, no, "smart" is the word,
not nerdy.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.342
- Well,
before I liked nice guys,

02:48.385 --> 02:49.995
I would have just
called you a nerd,

02:50.039 --> 02:51.867
and now I like it.

02:53.434 --> 02:56.045
- I never know
where anything is in here.

02:56.088 --> 02:58.569
- Slivington.

02:58.613 --> 03:00.789
- But where do you have plates?
Wait, hold on a second.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.704
Let's focus on breakfast.
- It's so nice today.

03:02.747 --> 03:06.055
- Can we focus on me
and breakfast before the dogs?

03:06.098 --> 03:09.928
This is where your attention
span dwindles quickly.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.585
- I have ADD.
I can get away with it.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.283
- Oh.

03:16.326 --> 03:17.980
- Is it your mom?
- I think it's my mom calling.

03:18.023 --> 03:19.677
- Sher Bear.

03:19.721 --> 03:22.811
- Hey, Sher Bear.
What's happening?

03:22.854 --> 03:24.465
Paris says hi,
and she loves you.

03:24.508 --> 03:25.901
- Love you.
Miss you.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.816
<i>Ever since Carter
and I had our first date,</i>

03:27.859 --> 03:30.514
I noticed just how sweet
he was with his mom.

03:30.558 --> 03:34.039
Like, I'd never seen a man
treat his mother like that.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.781
- I had a reminder to call you
in, like, two hours,

03:36.825 --> 03:39.131
and I'll get you
some good food delivered.

03:39.175 --> 03:42.265
We can decide what you want me
to have delivered for you.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.875
- That was something
that I always heard,

03:43.919 --> 03:45.790
that you can tell a lot
about a man by the way

03:45.834 --> 03:47.836
he treats his mother,
because you know

03:47.879 --> 03:50.926
that he'll make an amazing
husband and father one day.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.145
- Paris, my mom wants to know
how the wedding planning's

03:53.189 --> 03:55.147
going and if there's
anything she can do to help.

03:55.191 --> 03:57.237
- It's going really good.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.673
- All right.
She says it's going well.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.065
- And I would love her help.
- And she might call you

04:00.109 --> 04:02.546
later this week to pick
your brain on some stuff.

04:03.678 --> 04:05.984
All right.
I love you. Mwah!

04:06.028 --> 04:08.596
Talk to you later.
- I love Sher Bear.

04:08.639 --> 04:12.077
- My mom just absolutely loves
Paris and is always asking me,

04:12.121 --> 04:13.862
"What's Paris up to?

04:13.905 --> 04:15.907
Say hi to Paris.
Tell Paris I love her."

04:15.951 --> 04:18.997
It means so much to me
to see my mom love Paris--

04:19.041 --> 04:20.738
again, the human being Paris,

04:20.782 --> 04:22.436
not Paris Hilton,
the celebrity, so much.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.877
Hey, Mom.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.444
I'm just in the middle
of a meeting.

04:30.487 --> 04:33.273
Can I call you back
in 30 minutes?

04:33.316 --> 04:34.404
Oh, what's going on?

04:37.668 --> 04:39.191
- You're not going
until Monday,

04:39.235 --> 04:41.411
and today's Saturday,
so you got plenty of time,

04:41.455 --> 04:42.412
so let me call you
in 30 minutes.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.806
I love you.

04:44.849 --> 04:48.200
Sorry, my only rule is,
I pick up my mom's calls.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.290
All right.
- I love Sher Bear.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.291
- I have an older brother--

04:51.334 --> 04:52.901
<i>he's 2 1/2 years older--</i>

04:52.944 --> 04:55.033
<i>and a little sister that's
2 1/2 years younger.</i>

04:55.077 --> 04:57.253
<i>Not a day goes by
that we don't talk to her</i>

04:57.297 --> 04:59.603
<i>or we don't try
to figure out how she's doing,</i>

04:59.647 --> 05:01.997
<i>because, obviously,
my mom's getting older,</i>

05:02.040 --> 05:04.391
<i>and sometimes
she loses her balance.</i>

05:04.434 --> 05:07.611
<i>And my dad passed away very
unexpectedly four years ago,</i>

05:07.655 --> 05:09.961
<i>and so I think we owe it
to him</i>

05:10.005 --> 05:12.573
<i>to take extremely good
care of her.</i>

05:12.616 --> 05:14.401
- What date do we fly
to Traverse City

05:14.444 --> 05:16.620
for Jay's wedding?

05:16.664 --> 05:17.969
- I don't know what day
we're going to Traverse City.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.841
It's coming up, though,
pretty quickly.

05:21.190 --> 05:24.149
- It's so funny to think that,
20 months ago,

05:24.193 --> 05:28.197
he asked me to DJ his wedding,
and now, I'm really doing it.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.416
- Oh, yeah.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.069
He's like,
"Hi, nice to meet you, Paris.

05:31.113 --> 05:34.769
If you guys end up together,
can you DJ my wedding?"

05:35.900 --> 05:38.033
Yeah.
Yeah, Cousin Jay's got a good--

05:38.076 --> 05:42.124
got a good shake of it, because
have you done many weddings?

05:42.167 --> 05:44.866
- If it's a really substantial
offer, and it's worth my time.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.346
- So you don't do bar mitzvahs
or weddings...

05:46.389 --> 05:47.651
- I'm more into, like...
- Unless they pay you enough.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.392
- Music festivals
and things like that, but...

05:49.436 --> 05:50.393
- Yeah.
- Yeah,

05:50.437 --> 05:51.655
I've done some pretty big...

05:51.699 --> 05:54.049
- Weddings.
- Weddings, bar mitzvahs.

05:54.092 --> 05:56.356
- I'm gonna start eating.
Is that okay?

05:56.399 --> 05:58.532
- Yeah.
- Oh...

06:02.623 --> 06:04.189
You look good for breakfast.

06:05.756 --> 06:07.671
I always like
to look cute for you.

06:07.715 --> 06:10.021
- You always look cute for me.

06:10.065 --> 06:11.675
I love you.

06:11.719 --> 06:14.548
And not just because you make
amazing breakfast sandwiches.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.680
I love you in general too.
- Thanks.

06:19.117 --> 06:20.815
- Oh, so good.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.599
<i>- ♪ Bring me back to you</i>

06:25.646 --> 06:31.695
<i>♪</i>

06:31.739 --> 06:33.654
<i>♪ Bring, bring me back</i>

06:33.697 --> 06:35.960
<i>♪ Bring me back to you</i>

06:37.875 --> 06:39.529
- Paris?

06:39.573 --> 06:40.748
There anybody home?

06:42.619 --> 06:46.057
All right,
so Paris is a collector.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.408
- Okay.
- So we need to kind of

06:48.451 --> 06:52.324
figure out what we want to keep
and what really should go.

06:52.368 --> 06:57.460
Paris' house is still a little
bit of the bachelorette pad,

06:57.504 --> 07:00.724
and she has
a lot of knick-knacks.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.944
- It's too much, right?
- It's too much.

07:02.987 --> 07:04.989
Just clean it up.

07:05.033 --> 07:08.210
- Does she agree with that?
- We'll see.

07:09.037 --> 07:13.868
So I want to kind of organize
things a little bit

07:13.911 --> 07:18.089
so that she's
organized mentally

07:18.133 --> 07:20.614
for the upcoming wedding.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.311
Would you ladies
like something to drink?

07:22.354 --> 07:23.573
- Just a regular water.
- What would you like?

07:23.617 --> 07:24.487
- I'll take a sparkling water,
please.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.923
- Okay, great.

07:25.967 --> 07:30.188
Cecilia and Andrea
are professional organizers

07:30.232 --> 07:32.843
who I trust implicitly,

07:32.887 --> 07:34.671
<i>who have both helped me</i>

07:34.715 --> 07:36.717
over the years,
and they remember.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.023
You could call them a month
later, two months later.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.896
They know exactly
where every little thing is.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.550
That's your water.
- Thank you.

07:43.593 --> 07:47.510
- And this is a black cherry
seltzer water...

07:47.554 --> 07:48.511
- Mm, thank you.
- For you.

07:48.555 --> 07:49.817
- All right.
- Mom?

07:49.860 --> 07:51.296
- I was just coming by.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.863
Remember, I told you

07:52.907 --> 07:58.042
that I was going
to bring fantastic organizers.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.783
- Hello.
Hi.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.263
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

08:01.306 --> 08:02.830
- Nice to meet you too.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.614
- I'm Cecilia, the organizer.
- Hi, Cecilia.

08:04.658 --> 08:05.833
- And this is Andrea.
- Paris, how are you?

08:05.876 --> 08:07.748
Nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.489
Sorry, I didn't know
you guys were coming.

08:09.532 --> 08:11.273
I'm kind of annoyed,
'cause I told her

08:11.316 --> 08:13.580
not to go to my house,

08:13.623 --> 08:14.929
but she doesn't listen.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.496
- You know I don't listen.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.891
They're the only people
that I trust.

08:20.935 --> 08:22.545
- Okay?
- Thank you, Kathy.

08:22.589 --> 08:23.633
- Absolutely.
- And I trust you, too,

08:23.677 --> 08:25.330
because we don't trust anyone.

08:27.550 --> 08:28.812
Is that a White Claw?

08:28.856 --> 08:31.119
- What is that?
- Oh, it is, White Claw.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.644
It's good.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.516
- What?
- It is?

08:38.082 --> 08:39.693
That's why
I feel a little dizzy.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.433
- You do feel dizzy?

08:41.477 --> 08:42.609
Oh, my God.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.001
- You're like,
"They're professionals."

08:44.045 --> 08:45.350
I'm like, "Oh, yeah,
With the White Claw."

08:45.394 --> 08:47.614
- I was like, this is so good.

08:47.657 --> 08:50.181
- It is good.

08:50.225 --> 08:51.618
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.533
I thought it was one
of the drinks with the flavor.

08:53.576 --> 08:54.534
- Oh, it's okay.
I'm almost done.

08:57.232 --> 08:58.450
- Oh, my goodness.
- It's really good.

08:58.494 --> 09:01.018
- And this--
this 100% water?

09:04.848 --> 09:07.285
- All right, so should we
show them the garage

09:07.329 --> 09:09.418
just to get an idea?

09:10.593 --> 09:13.509
She's never, ever had anybody
organize, because she doesn't--

09:13.553 --> 09:14.989
- Oh, that's why.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.686
- Thank you.
- You know.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.601
Let's see.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.386
So this is the garage.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.564
- Yes.

09:27.915 --> 09:31.266
- Oh, wow.
- So we built, like,

09:31.309 --> 09:33.050
closet space, and, like,

09:33.094 --> 09:35.792
this is where all
the art stuff is, and--

09:35.836 --> 09:37.359
- Yeah.
- The ski stuff,

09:37.402 --> 09:39.535
do you think I should send
to a storage unit?

09:39.579 --> 09:40.797
- No, Paris.
- It's summertime.

09:40.841 --> 09:42.451
- We're spending so much money
on storage.

09:42.494 --> 09:45.410
- The storage unit is literally
the size of Costco.

09:45.454 --> 09:46.368
Like, I'm not kidding.

09:48.892 --> 09:50.154
- Do you think you're up
for that?

09:52.200 --> 09:54.419
You have to dedicate
the next year to Paris.

09:54.463 --> 09:57.727
- I always loved collecting
Barbies and anything Disney,

09:57.771 --> 09:59.468
and now that I'm an adult,

09:59.511 --> 10:02.253
I still love to collect
those things, and clothes,

10:02.297 --> 10:05.387
and shoes, and handbags,
and jewelry, and sunglasses.

10:05.430 --> 10:08.520
I think, 'cause I love going
shopping, people send me gifts.

10:08.564 --> 10:12.916
Brands send me gifts,
so it just all adds up.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.658
- I'm so happy
that you kept my--

10:15.702 --> 10:17.094
- Llama?
- My little llama out here.

10:17.138 --> 10:18.269
- Llama.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.619
- I'll bring it inside.

10:19.662 --> 10:22.926
I'll put it
with all my other stuff.

10:22.970 --> 10:25.146
- But there are things here
that people could be using.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.495
- Yeah.
- What we did is we made

10:26.538 --> 10:27.801
a big list, Paris.

10:27.844 --> 10:30.107
- Yeah.
- You can sit there and say--

10:30.151 --> 10:31.152
oh, my goodness.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.501
- Look at her.

10:32.544 --> 10:33.633
- Yeah.
- Isn't that cute?

10:33.676 --> 10:35.373
Me and Carter.
- Yes.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.462
But there's so many things here
that are not--

10:37.506 --> 10:38.899
- But some stuff I like
to keep as memories.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.770
- I agree.
- Like, this I could put

10:40.814 --> 10:42.119
on the dining room table.

10:42.163 --> 10:43.425
- No.
We don't want to--

10:43.468 --> 10:45.514
I don't want to have
any toys in the house.

10:45.557 --> 10:46.950
I don't mind you keeping them,
but it's just--

10:46.994 --> 10:48.256
- Well, I don't want
to hide all of them.

10:48.299 --> 10:49.387
- How are we ever gonna
see anything, honey?

10:49.431 --> 10:53.217
- I don't know.
- She enjoys taking

10:53.261 --> 10:56.612
the little toys
off a birthday cake,

10:56.656 --> 10:58.527
like a four-year-old,

10:58.570 --> 11:02.966
as much as if they were
something very expensive,

11:03.010 --> 11:05.142
<i>like Gucci earrings.</i>

11:05.186 --> 11:08.537
She loves that,
where other people would think,

11:08.580 --> 11:09.843
"Oh, it's junk."

11:09.886 --> 11:14.325
This is really just for looks.
- Books?

11:14.369 --> 11:17.720
- We're going to put every one
of these books away.

11:17.764 --> 11:18.895
- So no books at all?
- Am I right?

11:18.939 --> 11:20.767
No books.
We don't need 'em.

11:20.810 --> 11:23.334
I think it's much more
interesting, in art,

11:23.378 --> 11:25.815
to see your collection
of a lot of the things,

11:25.859 --> 11:27.556
even some of your toys.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.950
- So where do the books go?
- Forget all the books.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.342
Mm-mm.
- I like books.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.823
- Well, you don't have room
for the books.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.825
-
I don't know.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.000
It's hard for me to say "no,"

11:37.044 --> 11:38.915
<i>especially when it involves my mom,</i>

11:38.959 --> 11:40.438
<i>because while I was
at boarding school,</i>

11:40.482 --> 11:43.833
we weren't ever allowed
to speak back to people

11:43.877 --> 11:46.009
at these places, so I think

11:46.053 --> 11:48.185
that's always been
a problem with me.

11:48.229 --> 11:49.970
Not just with,
you know, my family,

11:50.013 --> 11:53.713
but with also relationships,
with friendships.

11:53.756 --> 11:56.716
- You know?
- Uh-oh.

11:56.759 --> 11:59.849
So cute.
- You got to grow up.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.198
You're not
a little girl anymore.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.636
- Yes I am.

12:04.680 --> 12:08.031
- In your heart, but we have
to move forward now, seriously.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.424
- But I really do wear
these type of things.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.469
- I do--I get it,
but we're gonna narrow it down

12:11.513 --> 12:12.775
to, like, maybe ten.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.472
- No.
- And let other people enjoy,

12:14.516 --> 12:16.083
'cause you're not enjoying
any of this.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.345
- I am enjoying it.
- You can't see it.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.782
I mean, I do hold on
to some things,

12:19.826 --> 12:22.219
but she does hold on
to a lot of things.

12:22.263 --> 12:25.353
I think it's maybe being away
in boarding school, truthfully,

12:25.396 --> 12:28.399
<i>and not being able
to have her things.</i>

12:28.443 --> 12:32.534
So she likes to collect
and keep those things.

12:32.577 --> 12:33.796
Let's go in here, ladies.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.189
This is the glam room.
- Great.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.147
- The glam room is a disaster
right now.

12:37.191 --> 12:38.627
- I think it's a good idea.
- The glam room

12:38.670 --> 12:39.671
was perfect the other day.

12:39.715 --> 12:40.803
What happened?
- I just...

12:40.847 --> 12:41.935
- Yeah.
- Started getting a lot of--

12:41.978 --> 12:43.023
I went shopping.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.241
- Clean up first, right?

12:44.285 --> 12:45.765
- Yeah,
we got to organize it all.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.897
- And then look over here.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.507
- Mm.
- In there, right?

12:49.551 --> 12:51.901
- In this little--
- I've been organizing

12:51.945 --> 12:54.121
the sunglasses, which is good.

12:54.164 --> 12:58.125
<i>I never have really
ever confronted anyone.</i>

13:00.475 --> 13:03.130
- I just get nervous.
I don't know.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.523
It's weird,
'cause I'm not, like,

13:05.567 --> 13:09.136
a teenager anymore,
like I used to be.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.442
But I think it's just
so ingrained in me,

13:11.486 --> 13:15.664
from what I've been through
in--in life,

13:15.707 --> 13:18.319
and then--
I don't know.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.190
I've just had so many
bad things happen to me

13:20.234 --> 13:23.324
that I almost
just get used to it.

13:25.326 --> 13:29.025
This was supposed
to be my fiancé's closet,

13:29.069 --> 13:31.898
but I've kind of taken it over,
which--

13:31.941 --> 13:33.073
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.335
- He doesn't have
too much clothes, right?

13:34.378 --> 13:35.684
- Yeah, he's a boy,
so boys don't have much.

13:35.727 --> 13:36.816
- Yeah, boys--
- But I just felt

13:36.859 --> 13:38.295
like the gowns and stuff--

13:38.339 --> 13:39.906
- They're happy you're happy.
- That's actually nice.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.951
- Yeah, okay.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.867
- But it's hard.
I think

13:44.911 --> 13:47.565
I haven't fully, like,
let go of a lot

13:47.609 --> 13:50.873
of what I've been through,
so it's still there.

13:53.223 --> 13:55.138
- No, it's too much.
- It's too much.

13:55.182 --> 13:57.140
So this
is your everyday closet?

13:57.184 --> 13:59.664
This is where you come here
and dress here?

13:59.708 --> 14:00.970
- Yes.
- Okay.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.580
The only closet?
- Yeah.

14:02.624 --> 14:03.755
- It really looks awful.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.453
It's holding you back.
- I know.

14:05.496 --> 14:06.846
- Right?
- Yes.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.370
- You want to have
everything before the wedding,

14:09.413 --> 14:12.025
I would think you'd want
to have this room cleared out.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.766
We need to get downstairs
started right away.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.203
- Mm-hmm.
- And then...

14:16.246 --> 14:17.508
- Okay.
- We'll get into the garage

14:17.552 --> 14:18.770
and here.

14:18.814 --> 14:20.120
- Okay.
- And the bedroom.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.209
- 'Cause I'm going
to Michigan first, so--

14:22.252 --> 14:23.863
- How long will you be gone?

14:23.906 --> 14:25.734
- I think, like, five days.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.523
- Well, we can always come and
do whatever when you're gone.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.525
If I know it's something
you're not gonna use again,

14:34.569 --> 14:35.613
I can tell.

14:35.657 --> 14:37.354
- I like to tell, too, so--

14:37.398 --> 14:39.139
- I know, I get it.
- I want to be here.

14:39.182 --> 14:40.314
- Figure it out.
- We'll do it when I get back.

14:40.357 --> 14:41.706
- Otherwise,
I'm just gonna show up.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.013
- No, Mom.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.319
- This has got to get done.

14:45.362 --> 14:47.277
I'm getting hot in here
and claustrophobic.

14:47.321 --> 14:48.278
- Okay.
- So...

14:48.322 --> 14:50.890
- Sorry.
- Let's go.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.674
- Diamond.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.371
- Yeah.
It's time for you to organize.

14:54.415 --> 14:55.851
- And you've got things
that are next

14:55.895 --> 14:57.070
to each other, snagging.

14:57.113 --> 14:58.071
I mean, this is beyond.
- I know.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.594
I don't know what to do.

15:05.905 --> 15:12.737
<i>♪</i>

15:15.044 --> 15:18.526
- All right, you ready to check
out the Bayshore Hotel?

15:18.569 --> 15:20.702
Now, just keep an open mind.
- Mm-hmm.

15:22.747 --> 15:25.011
- Ready?
- Yeah.

15:25.054 --> 15:26.360
- All right.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.449
I just keep telling myself
how low-key you are.

15:28.492 --> 15:29.363
- Yeah.
- See, look at

15:29.406 --> 15:30.407
how nice this is.

15:30.451 --> 15:31.843
They have an indoor pool.

15:31.887 --> 15:34.585
It's painted like the sky.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.022
It's nice, right?

15:36.065 --> 15:38.241
We are in Michigan,
since my cousin, Jay,

15:38.285 --> 15:40.461
is marrying his
longtime girlfriend, Eleni.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.942
Oh, that's nice.
People getting married.

- Nice.
- Congratulations.

Her uncle was governor
of Michigan for 14 years.

15:54.257 --> 15:57.304
<i>We would go up there.
We'd water-ski, and hang out</i>

15:57.347 --> 15:59.828
with my cousins
and play tennis and play golf.

15:59.871 --> 16:03.397
Obviously, it just has
a special place in my life.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.138
All right.

16:06.269 --> 16:07.705
- Ooh.

16:07.749 --> 16:10.621
- So chic.
- Is that an alligator?

16:10.665 --> 16:12.580
- That is pretty cute.
They did an...

16:12.623 --> 16:14.625
Oh, look at this, though.
Now that's cute.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.714
You don't see this
at the Four Seasons.

16:16.758 --> 16:19.674
They're elephants.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.197
I'm so glad we're up here.
- This is so romantic.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.243
- Even though
this isn't the nicest place

16:23.286 --> 16:25.767
you've ever stayed, I'm so glad
you're up here with my family.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.073
It means so much to me.
You know that.

16:27.116 --> 16:29.075
- I would stay
anywhere with you,

16:29.118 --> 16:30.206
even in a garbage can.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.860
-
- No, I don't mean this is.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.036
I mean I would literally,
if, like, we had nowhere

16:34.080 --> 16:36.560
to stay,
and we only could stay, like,

16:36.604 --> 16:39.824
in a garbage land place,
I would do it.

"because we all wear
matching Christmas onesies,

<i>and we also do a play called
'12 Days of Christmas.'"</i>

16:54.839 --> 16:56.841
And I totally thought
he was joking.

16:56.885 --> 17:00.976
Christmas Eve, they give us
these two yellow hats,

17:01.020 --> 17:03.979
and they're like,
"You guys are the French hens."

And literally, the whole family
has all these props

Honeymoon--basically

It's got a whole bathtub

17:46.065 --> 17:48.676
and just being in
so many different towns

17:48.719 --> 17:50.939
and places
throughout the Midwest,

17:50.982 --> 17:52.245
I feel like
I know it very well.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.725
<i>I'm just not made
for small towns,</i>

17:54.769 --> 17:59.078
but I'll make it work.

18:00.862 --> 18:01.993
I wish they had
better shopping.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.212
That's another thing.

18:03.256 --> 18:05.040
There's only one street
with stores.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.522
I don't know how people,
like, get clothes there.

18:08.565 --> 18:11.090
It's literally one street
with stores,

18:11.133 --> 18:14.180
and then the rest
is just the lake.

18:15.833 --> 18:19.054
This is so private.
- Keep an open mind.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.710
Let's see.

18:22.753 --> 18:26.366
- Um--
- I think it's very nice.

18:26.409 --> 18:28.585
- I like the bathtub.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.894
- For me, it's just really
important that Paris loves

18:32.937 --> 18:35.201
Traverse City and Michigan
as much as I do.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.725
<i>I want our children to go
to Michigan during the summer.</i>

18:37.768 --> 18:39.118
- I don't know.
- What do you think?

18:39.161 --> 18:41.685
Where are we gonna spend
our summers with our kids?

18:41.729 --> 18:44.558
- In Malibu, and Europe, Aspen,

18:44.601 --> 18:46.168
and just home, in LA.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.604
- And Traverse.

18:49.867 --> 18:51.652
Check out the view here, P.
- Okay.

18:51.695 --> 18:54.176
- Keep an open mind.
- Okay.

18:54.220 --> 18:57.048
- Traverse is gorgeous.
I love you.

18:57.092 --> 18:59.225
- I love you too.
- All right.

18:59.268 --> 19:00.922
You got to get
your energy up, though.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.271
We got a lot of activities
while we're here.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.752
- We just got here.
- Clam bakes,

19:04.795 --> 19:07.233
rehearsal dinners, wedding,
you got to DJ.

19:07.276 --> 19:09.887
- I'm just tired
from that plane ride.

19:09.931 --> 19:12.586
- Resting is for
after we leave.

19:12.629 --> 19:13.935
I want to make sure--you know,

19:13.978 --> 19:16.111
our children are gonna
be really fortunate,

19:16.155 --> 19:17.982
and they're gonna
probably look like their mom,

19:18.026 --> 19:20.159
and I think you have
to do things

19:20.202 --> 19:23.771
to just make them feel normal
and grounded and, you know,

19:23.814 --> 19:25.990
what I always tell people
about Michigan

19:26.034 --> 19:29.037
is you only have to make two
decisions, usually, every day,

19:29.080 --> 19:32.127
and it's whether we water ski
or wake skate first.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.998
- Is there anything else
to do there?

19:34.042 --> 19:36.610
- There's golf.
There's putt-putt golf.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.046
There's real golf.

19:38.089 --> 19:42.790
I got to go get the stuff,
and then let's go.

19:44.487 --> 19:45.836
Activities!

19:45.880 --> 19:47.098
- Okay.
- All right, love you.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.274
- I just want to chill
for a little bit.

19:48.317 --> 19:49.797
- No,
you get five minutes to chill.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.929
Then you got to--we got
to just look at the itinerary

19:51.973 --> 19:53.409
and make stuff happen.

19:59.850 --> 20:01.591
<i>- ♪ I'm crazy, I'm crazy</i>

20:01.635 --> 20:03.506
<i>♪ I'm crazy for you</i>

20:03.550 --> 20:05.421
<i>♪ I'm mixed up, mixed up</i>

20:05.465 --> 20:07.641
<i>♪ For you, I'm falling</i>

20:07.684 --> 20:09.947
<i>♪ I'm crazy, I'm crazy</i>

20:09.991 --> 20:12.211
<i>♪ I'm crazy for you</i>

20:12.254 --> 20:14.778
- Hi, guys.

20:14.822 --> 20:17.216
It's a beautiful day.
- Beautiful day.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.261
- Paris was
a little intimidated

20:19.305 --> 20:21.829
by all the activities
I told her we're going on.

20:21.872 --> 20:24.266
Told her that's
the Milliken way, right?

20:24.310 --> 20:27.313
- Yes, but we could slice
some of them out.

20:27.356 --> 20:30.577
- Tell Paris how you guys got
married at your parents' house.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.492
- 1967.

20:32.535 --> 20:35.886
There was one well-known
caterer.

20:35.930 --> 20:38.367
We signed him up.
We were married on a Monday,

20:38.411 --> 20:41.631
because Bob had the bar exam
the prior week,

20:41.675 --> 20:43.416
and we had to be
in Boston on Friday

20:43.459 --> 20:45.679
because I was gonna be
teaching school

20:45.722 --> 20:47.420
and being the breadwinner.

20:47.463 --> 20:49.204
- And Dad was going
to Harvard Business School.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.337
- We were married on a Monday,
at noon,

20:51.380 --> 20:54.383
and we went back to the house,
hooked up a U-Haul,

20:54.427 --> 20:57.038
and drove out to Boston.

20:57.081 --> 20:59.562
That first year
was pretty tough.

20:59.606 --> 21:01.564
I had a bitch for a principal.

21:02.870 --> 21:05.176
One other girl there
that was my age,

21:05.220 --> 21:09.398
and this bitch principal,
who was this little, old lady,

21:09.442 --> 21:11.574
you know,
everything we did was wrong,

21:11.618 --> 21:13.620
and there were
no written rules.

21:13.663 --> 21:14.795
- Did you have
a wedding planner,

21:14.838 --> 21:16.057
or did your mom plan it,
or you plan it?

21:16.100 --> 21:17.363
- No, I planned it.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.800
- By yourself?
- Well, with my mother.

21:19.843 --> 21:21.323
The wedding--it was beautiful.

21:21.367 --> 21:22.498
- Mom, do you know
what Paris calls me?

21:22.542 --> 21:23.586
- No.

21:23.630 --> 21:25.284
- Paris, tell her
what you call me.

21:26.459 --> 21:27.634
- Groomzilla.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.418
- And I call her
Absentee Bride,

21:29.462 --> 21:31.551
'cause every time
I ask Paris if we can do

21:31.594 --> 21:34.380
some wedding planning, she
goes, "I don't have the time."

21:34.423 --> 21:38.384
I said--and so now I spend four
or five hours every weekend

21:38.427 --> 21:40.429
working with Hallie
on the invites,

21:40.473 --> 21:41.430
doing the invite list--

21:41.474 --> 21:42.605
- I've been helping too.

21:42.649 --> 21:44.215
- Tell her I'm not Groomzilla.

21:44.259 --> 21:47.480
I'm just trying to be helpful,
because I see a white space

21:47.523 --> 21:50.396
or a void in the team
that is not being filled

21:50.439 --> 21:52.789
by anyone pushing the ball
forward quite as quickly.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.269
'Cause it's only
three months away.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.053
We don't even have an invite.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.968
- Well, you got to get going.

21:58.012 --> 21:59.318
- I didn't make up
the nickname.

21:59.361 --> 22:00.406
Your sister did.

22:00.449 --> 22:02.016
- I don't believe that
for a heartbeat.

22:03.757 --> 22:05.628
I had, like,
this time set aside,

22:05.672 --> 22:07.500
and she just kept being like,
"Oh, a few more minutes.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.240
A few more minutes,"
and I finally walk out

22:09.284 --> 22:11.112
of my office, and I said,
"Paris, what is going on?

22:11.155 --> 22:13.114
We need to wedding plan.
We're so close."

22:13.157 --> 22:15.812
She said, "I'm just working
on my Halloween costumes."

22:15.856 --> 22:17.205
Yeah, yeah.
I got you, Sher Bear.

22:17.248 --> 22:18.772
- Okay.
Carter, you know,

22:18.815 --> 22:20.121
these glasses are--

22:20.164 --> 22:22.906
- I know, we need
to get you a new prescription.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.299
So let's just do--
- I'm the Halloween queen.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.605
Yeah, no, that's--
- I need to have my outfits.

22:25.648 --> 22:27.433
- I get that.
Let's just do some quick math.

22:27.476 --> 22:31.262
How many Halloweens will there
be between now and forever?

22:31.306 --> 22:32.742
- A lot.
- A lot, okay.

22:32.786 --> 22:37.094
How many weddings will we have
between now and forever?

22:37.138 --> 22:38.835
- One.
- One.

22:41.969 --> 22:43.057
- It's so great to be back here

22:43.100 --> 22:44.798
with you guys in Traverse City,

22:44.841 --> 22:47.191
and congratulations
to Jay and Eleni.

22:47.235 --> 22:49.455
I wish you a lifetime
of happiness.

22:49.498 --> 22:52.283
I'm so happy to be here and to
DJ your wedding tomorrow night.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.851
- Yeah, cheers!
Cheers.

22:54.895 --> 22:56.810
- Love you guys.
- Cheers.

22:56.853 --> 22:59.029
- Cheers, guys.
- Yes.

23:00.683 --> 23:03.556
- Any tips for Paris,
to make sure she fits in

23:03.599 --> 23:05.558
in Traverse, or in part
of the Milliken family?

23:05.601 --> 23:06.689
Eleni, do you have any?

23:06.733 --> 23:08.648
You're the newest member
of the family.

23:08.691 --> 23:10.867
- We're marrying into the best
family you could ever imagine.

23:10.911 --> 23:12.216
Like, just welcoming,

23:12.260 --> 23:14.958
and you guys have always
been so wonderful.

23:15.002 --> 23:16.438
I love you so much.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.397
I'm so excited!

23:18.440 --> 23:19.441
- We love you.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.269
- I'm so happy
for you guys too.

23:21.312 --> 23:23.140
- Aw.
- You're very lovable.

23:23.184 --> 23:24.620
- We're very lucky.
- We're so lucky.

23:24.664 --> 23:27.667
- Do you have much of
the planning done yet or what?

23:27.710 --> 23:29.190
- I'm trying.
It's hard.

23:29.233 --> 23:31.584
- Plan ahead to delegate.

23:31.627 --> 23:33.194
Like, people keep asking me
how they can help,

23:33.237 --> 23:35.414
and I'm like,
"I think I've got it,"

23:35.457 --> 23:39.200
but then it's like,
had I planned a little better--

23:39.243 --> 23:40.941
- It's a lot,
and coming down to the wire,

23:40.984 --> 23:43.683
the last few minutes.

23:43.726 --> 23:45.685
- For you two,
did it bring you

23:45.728 --> 23:47.469
closer together,
or was it tough?

23:47.513 --> 23:48.296
Don't answer that.

23:48.339 --> 23:49.732
- No.
- No, yeah.

23:49.776 --> 23:54.389
Maggie and Darcy, did you
and Paris compare notes--

23:54.433 --> 23:56.609
we've been engaged
for seven months,

23:56.652 --> 23:58.219
you've been engaged
for two weeks--

23:58.262 --> 23:59.960
on what you guys have
accomplished versus us?

24:00.003 --> 24:01.135
You guys talk about that yet?

24:01.178 --> 24:03.485
Did that come up
naturally or no?

24:05.400 --> 24:09.056
Now, why don't you guys say
to P what you have nailed down,

24:09.099 --> 24:12.102
and then, P,
you give "yay" or "nay"

24:12.146 --> 24:13.495
if we also
have it nailed down, okay?

24:13.539 --> 24:15.323
- Okay.
- Why don't you start?

24:15.366 --> 24:17.499
- The band.
- No.

24:17.543 --> 24:18.848
Okay.
- Don't do that right now.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.241
- Oh, okay, no.
- Just say no.

24:20.284 --> 24:21.416
- No, okay.
- Just like me.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.939
We don't have that yet.
Okay, what else?

24:22.983 --> 24:24.245
Darce?
- A photographer.

24:24.288 --> 24:26.682
- We do too.
You've got him.

24:26.726 --> 24:29.119
- Okay. We'll go 50--50%.

24:29.163 --> 24:30.817
We have one photographer.
Okay.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.775
- You guys are on, like, a one-
decision-a-week thing, right?

24:32.819 --> 24:34.168
- Yeah, that's how it started.
- And Maggie's

24:34.211 --> 24:36.083
on a one-decision-an-hour.

24:36.126 --> 24:38.041
- Yeah, exactly.
So we're coming--

24:38.085 --> 24:40.653
we're making, yeah,
a strong push here.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.002
- Yeah.
- Right?

24:42.045 --> 24:43.612
- Mm-hmm.

24:43.656 --> 24:45.745
I feel like Carter is just
trying to put me on the spot

24:45.788 --> 24:48.748
because he wants me to start
planning the wedding more,

24:48.791 --> 24:50.445
but this isn't a competition,

24:50.489 --> 24:53.448
and I don't like him calling me
out in front of his family.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.059
- Paris, you got to get
your together.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.844
You got to plan.

24:57.887 --> 25:01.151
The one thing about P
that's funny is, I'll be like,

25:01.195 --> 25:02.936
"Well, you know,
at a wedding, you do X,"

25:02.979 --> 25:04.285
and then, finally, she,

25:04.328 --> 25:06.069
"You know, I haven't been
to many weddings."

25:06.113 --> 25:07.941
She's like,
"My brother's, my sister's."

25:07.984 --> 25:09.943
So we got a book--

25:09.986 --> 25:12.859
she got a book that was
like "Weddings for Dummies."

25:12.902 --> 25:14.730
It's like "

25:14.774 --> 25:17.341
"The rehearsal dinner
is a dinner typically done

25:17.385 --> 25:19.082
the day prior to the wedding."

25:19.126 --> 25:21.737
- And you rehearse.
- Right, P?

25:21.781 --> 25:24.610
- But maybe, once you're done
planning Maggie's wedding...

25:24.653 --> 25:26.307
- Or maybe one decision a day.
- We can also just add them

25:26.350 --> 25:28.527
as part of our arsenal
for our wedding.

25:28.570 --> 25:31.573
What do you think?
- Yeah, I need some advice.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.532
Carter is starting
to get really nervous

25:33.575 --> 25:36.360
and feels like this wedding
is just not even gonna happen.

25:36.404 --> 25:38.493
<i>'Cause I've been
engaged before,</i>

25:38.537 --> 25:40.713
<i>but I've always broken up
with them before the wedding.</i>

25:40.756 --> 25:43.498
So he's going
into Groomzilla overdrive.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.456
<i>It just makes me
super uncomfortable.</i>

25:45.500 --> 25:46.806
- But thank everyone here,

25:46.849 --> 25:48.895
because you guys have made
Paris feel so welcome.

25:48.938 --> 25:50.636
- Yeah, thank you all.
She's always saying how much

25:50.679 --> 25:52.028
she loves everybody, so--

25:52.072 --> 25:53.160
- Yeah.
- I said that

25:53.203 --> 25:54.596
since the first day.

25:54.640 --> 25:55.641
- Yes!
- Cheers.

25:55.684 --> 25:56.903
- Here's to 50 more years

25:56.946 --> 25:58.557
of you coming
to Traverse City, Michigan.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.558
Yeah!
- All right.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.038
- Thank you, guys.
- Cheers.

26:06.216 --> 26:08.958
<i>- ♪ Put your hands up
if you feel real good ♪</i>

26:09.002 --> 26:10.743
<i>♪ Feel like everybody

Come on in, ladies.

- Hi.
- Ooh, it's warm out there.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.365
- Hi.
- Come on in.

26:24.408 --> 26:26.497
- So nice in here.
- Charlotte?

26:26.541 --> 26:27.542
Hi, honey.
How are you?

26:27.586 --> 26:28.761
- Hi, Ms. H.
How are you?

26:28.804 --> 26:30.066
- Good.
- Hi, how are you?

26:30.110 --> 26:31.633
- Hi.
- Hello.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.592
- My organizers.
We're here.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.289
- We're here.
- Oh, my--oh, my God.

26:35.332 --> 26:37.639
- This is Charlotte.
- Hi, I'm Charlotte.

26:37.683 --> 26:38.727
Very nice to meet you.
- This is Paris' left

26:38.771 --> 26:39.772
and right hand.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.295
I'm gonna--we're gonna go up,

26:41.338 --> 26:45.299
and we're gonna undo all
of the books on the landing.

26:45.342 --> 26:46.605
But first, I want to get--

26:46.648 --> 26:48.694
where is the Windex
and just some rags?

26:48.737 --> 26:51.827
- Okay.
Paris is not here.

26:51.871 --> 26:53.829
- No, I know.
She's in Michigan.

26:53.873 --> 26:55.962
- Okay.
- So I'll take you girls up.

26:56.005 --> 26:57.485
- Okay.
- And we'll start.

26:57.528 --> 27:01.271
Paris asked me to wait
while she went to Michigan,

27:01.315 --> 27:02.838
<i>so she said,
"Don't go to the house</i>

27:02.882 --> 27:04.623
<i>"and start the organizing,</i>

27:04.666 --> 27:06.189
<i>you know, until I get home."</i>

27:06.233 --> 27:07.582
<i>And I thought to myself,</i>

27:07.626 --> 27:10.672
"If I don't start doing it,
it won't get done."

27:12.500 --> 27:14.241
- No.
- That's okay.

27:14.284 --> 27:19.812
- If you ladies wouldn't mind
grabbing some boxes...

27:19.855 --> 27:22.902
- We're gonna put the books
in here.

27:22.945 --> 27:24.904
- These are all the same.

27:26.253 --> 27:28.690
- Together.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.387
- Just wait till we get
to the storage.

27:30.431 --> 27:33.739
It's like Costco.
Maybe like--what do you think?

27:33.782 --> 27:36.742
- Yeah.
Nice.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.961
- Hi, Mrs. Hilton.
- Hi, honey.

27:39.005 --> 27:40.484
- How is it going?
- Good.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.878
What do you think?
- I think it looks really cute.

27:42.922 --> 27:44.401
- Cute, right?
- I'm just trying

27:44.445 --> 27:45.925
to get the clutter, you know?

27:45.968 --> 27:49.058
- I'm a little nervous Paris
is gonna kill me.

27:49.102 --> 27:50.930
Like--
- Let her kill me.

27:50.973 --> 27:53.019
- Ah!
- Seriously.

27:53.062 --> 27:55.238
She's gonna feel
so much better.

27:55.282 --> 27:58.285
I know she's gonna be happy.
I know my daughter.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.679
I'm the mother,
and mom knows best.

28:02.463 --> 28:03.943

- Ew.
Just go through it.

28:19.654 --> 28:21.351
- Hi, girls.
Hey.

28:21.395 --> 28:24.137
- I think we need your help
with the worms.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.878
- This is so sad.

28:25.921 --> 28:26.879
- I know.
I'm like, I'm scared

28:26.922 --> 28:28.184

28:28.228 --> 28:30.056
- Okay. I got this worm.

28:30.099 --> 28:31.753
- Sorry.

28:31.797 --> 28:32.928
Are there smaller ones?
- Yeah.

28:32.972 --> 28:34.756
It's so big.
It feels like...

28:34.800 --> 28:36.671
- Okay.
- A human's finger.

28:36.715 --> 28:37.759
- There we go.
- Wait, this one's...

28:37.803 --> 28:39.065
- Oh, my God.
- Really big too.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.457
- I'm used to, like,
small ones.

28:40.501 --> 28:42.111
- Where would you go fishing,
growing up?

28:42.155 --> 28:45.419
- Everywhere.
In Malibu, Fiji, Bora Bora.

28:45.462 --> 28:46.768
Ugh.
- They're so slimy.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.161
-
- Wait, I think you got it.

28:48.204 --> 28:50.163
- No.
- Oh, it's so sad.

28:50.206 --> 28:51.947
- Ugh.

28:51.991 --> 28:52.905
- Okay.
- I hate it.

28:52.948 --> 28:54.776
- These hooks need to--

28:54.820 --> 28:57.431
- Okay.
You--you've almost got it.

28:57.474 --> 28:59.041
- Sorry, buddy.
- I just feel bad to be...

28:59.085 --> 29:01.261
- Aww.

29:01.304 --> 29:02.958
- Paris, can you show me
how to do this?

29:03.002 --> 29:04.699
So how do you do it?
You put your finger on--

29:04.743 --> 29:06.353
- Like, finger here, and...

29:06.396 --> 29:08.572
- Finger here.
- As you go like this,

29:08.616 --> 29:10.139
you, like, go like that.

29:10.183 --> 29:11.619
- Okay.
- Oh, watch out, Kelly.

29:11.662 --> 29:14.709
- The worm is gone.
Mother

29:19.366 --> 29:20.323
Hello?

29:21.803 --> 29:23.196
- Yeah.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.243
- Why?

29:30.029 --> 29:31.726
- What do you mean?

29:35.599 --> 29:37.036
- I told her not to do that.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.434
- Well, I want all my books,
so she, like--

29:44.478 --> 29:46.349
I'll try calling her now,
because this is beyond.

29:49.309 --> 29:50.266
- Okay.

29:54.444 --> 29:56.055
- Look how much better
this looks already.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.796
Right?
- Yes. Yes.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.710
- See, this--
now we can see things.

29:59.754 --> 30:00.711
- I know.
- Yeah.

30:00.755 --> 30:02.017
- See, she'll be happy.

30:02.061 --> 30:04.715
She gets angry
when I nose in her business.

30:04.759 --> 30:05.847
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- But then

30:05.891 --> 30:07.022
she's gonna be happy.

30:07.066 --> 30:08.371
- She's gonna be
so happy, yeah.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.200
- Hello?
Hello?

30:14.421 --> 30:15.683
- Mom, it's Paris.

30:15.726 --> 30:17.032
I just got a call
from Charlotte

30:17.076 --> 30:18.991
that you brought the organizers
to my house,

30:19.034 --> 30:20.383
and you're there now.

30:20.427 --> 30:21.907
I told you I didn't want people
coming there

30:21.950 --> 30:23.212
when I'm not there,

30:23.256 --> 30:27.216
so it's really not cool
that you did that.

30:27.260 --> 30:29.218
<i>My mom is just really
stressing me out.</i>

30:29.262 --> 30:31.090
<i>I think with my wedding
coming up really soon,</i>

30:31.133 --> 30:34.180
my mom is kind of freaking out
about losing me,

30:34.223 --> 30:38.184
so organizing my house is,
like, the one way to hold on.

30:39.707 --> 30:40.926
- Which one?
- Which one?

30:40.969 --> 30:43.319
- The little Paris purse.

30:43.363 --> 30:45.887
- It doesn't,
but we can add one.

30:45.931 --> 30:47.889
- Hi.
How are you?

30:47.933 --> 30:49.238
<i>- Hey, good.
How's it going?</i>

30:49.282 --> 30:52.328
- Good.
I'm just looking at everything.

30:52.372 --> 30:53.895
<i>- Love...
- Looks great.</i>

30:53.939 --> 30:58.247
<i>- Hey, I got a kind of
aggressive message from Paris.</i>

30:58.291 --> 31:00.032
- Oh? <i>
- I think she heard</i>

31:00.075 --> 31:01.555
<i>that you're at the house,</i>

31:01.598 --> 31:04.950
<i>so I think it might
be a good idea to wrap it up</i>

31:04.993 --> 31:07.256
<i>and maybe continue
when she's back in town.</i>

31:07.300 --> 31:11.043
- But she's gonna be so happy
when she sees it.

31:11.086 --> 31:12.435
<i>- I know.
I believe it.</i>

31:12.479 --> 31:14.437
<i>I believe it,
and I think she will be happy,</i>

31:14.481 --> 31:16.918
<i>but she was kind of upset,
so--</i>

31:16.962 --> 31:19.094
- Oh, she just gets nervous.

31:19.138 --> 31:20.966
You know, she likes
holding on to things.

31:21.009 --> 31:25.100
Paris is just trying
to exercise her power.

31:25.144 --> 31:28.799
I am not in her personal,
private--

31:28.843 --> 31:30.714
she probably,
in her mind, thinks,

31:30.758 --> 31:34.109
<i>oh, I'm in, like,
all of her personal--</i>

31:34.153 --> 31:36.068
<i>I'm really doing hard work</i>

31:36.111 --> 31:39.462
and actually,
really making it look cute.

31:39.506 --> 31:41.769
She's gonna love it. <i>
- I know.</i>

31:41.812 --> 31:42.944
- But we will.
We'll wrap it up,

31:42.988 --> 31:44.903
'cause we really
actually have--

31:44.946 --> 31:47.296
there's so much
that we've done already.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.211
<i>- Oh, good.
- And I think when she walks in</i>

31:49.255 --> 31:52.649
she'll just see this little bit
of change and love it.

31:52.693 --> 31:54.086
Perfect.

32:00.092 --> 32:04.748
<i>♪</i>

32:09.623 --> 32:11.277
- No.
- Cousin's always sleeping in.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.367
- Paris is--

32:14.410 --> 32:17.761
it's a little early for Paris,
so I did write her

32:17.805 --> 32:20.677
a handwritten note and say
it would mean a lot to me

32:20.721 --> 32:22.941
if she was able
to rally quickly.

32:22.984 --> 32:26.379
I set an alarm, so I'm hoping,
when the alarm goes off,

32:26.422 --> 32:28.337
that she reads my note,
she comes a-running.

32:28.381 --> 32:29.469
- Sounds good.
- Hey, I'm gonna go first.

32:29.512 --> 32:30.992
- You're gonna go first?
All right.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.646
Show us how it's done.
- Gonna go out from the middle.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.648
<i>- Paris is not
a morning person.</i>

32:34.691 --> 32:37.346
I tried to warn her,
but things like tubing,

32:37.390 --> 32:39.522
and waterskiing,
and wake skating--

32:39.566 --> 32:41.394
they all happen very early
in the morning,

32:41.437 --> 32:42.656
'cause otherwise,
the water gets rough.

32:42.699 --> 32:45.267
Show us how it's done.

32:48.444 --> 32:51.273
- Whoo!

32:51.317 --> 32:54.320
- Hopefully, Paris doesn't miss
out on all the action today,

32:54.363 --> 32:56.017
but in the meantime,
we'll have fun.

33:08.595 --> 33:11.946
- His family loves activities,
so it's like,

33:11.990 --> 33:13.513
every morning,
they get up like,

33:13.556 --> 33:16.516
"Let's go running.
Now we're gonna go skiing,

33:16.559 --> 33:18.561
and then we're gonna
go play tennis."

33:18.605 --> 33:20.128
<i>I'm not used to that,
'cause my family--</i>

33:20.172 --> 33:23.131
<i>we don't really do activities.</i>

33:23.175 --> 33:25.481
<i>Obviously, we have,
like, dinners and lunches</i>

33:25.525 --> 33:28.484
and hang out and talk,

33:28.528 --> 33:31.444
but it's not like
we're running around,

33:31.487 --> 33:34.751
you know, doing,
like, a triathlon all day.

33:43.630 --> 33:45.197
- All right.
- Whoo!

33:45.240 --> 33:47.329
- Who's up next?
Kelly?

33:48.548 --> 33:50.463
Oh, wow.
Paris.

33:51.203 --> 33:52.421
- Let's see.

33:52.465 --> 33:54.162
Paris.

33:54.206 --> 33:56.686
- Hi.
- Where are you?

33:56.730 --> 33:58.036
- Just chilling out
on the dock.

34:01.778 --> 34:05.043
We're gonna come and grab
you then in two minutes, okay?

34:05.086 --> 34:06.261
<i>- Okay.</i>

34:06.305 --> 34:08.785
- Love you.

34:08.829 --> 34:11.875
Paris, you made my day!

34:11.919 --> 34:14.443
- Your outfit matches
the unicorn.

34:14.487 --> 34:16.358
- Obviously.
I have to coordinate.

34:16.402 --> 34:18.360
- Paris, you look official.

34:18.404 --> 34:19.535
- Look at that.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.972
- Wow.
- I got it at Walmart.

34:22.016 --> 34:25.367
- All right.
You ready to jump on?

34:25.411 --> 34:26.368
- Okay.
- Put this in the back.

34:26.412 --> 34:28.240
- Whoa.

34:28.283 --> 34:29.458
- Good jump.
- Sorry I'm late.

34:29.502 --> 34:31.547
- No.
You are perfectly on time.

34:31.591 --> 34:32.853
Just the fact that you came.

34:32.896 --> 34:35.551
- Yes.
- I love you.

34:35.595 --> 34:37.075
I never, in my wildest dreams,

34:37.118 --> 34:39.903
actually thought she would
show up in the morning.

34:39.947 --> 34:42.210
<i>And I especially
did not expect Paris</i>

34:42.254 --> 34:47.302
to have a strong,
strong unicorn tubing game.

34:47.346 --> 34:50.088
So put your left foot over.

34:50.131 --> 34:52.307
- Or your--yeah, there you go.
- Oh, my God.

34:52.351 --> 34:54.440
- Oh, but get on your knees
when you get down.

34:54.483 --> 34:55.919
- Put your knees--
- Put your knees down.

34:55.963 --> 34:57.225
- Put your legs back.
No, no, sit down.

34:57.269 --> 34:58.357
No, no, no, no.
Yeah.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.141
- There you go.
I've gotcha.

35:00.185 --> 35:01.751
- Okay, yeah.

35:01.795 --> 35:02.796
But grab that.
- Got it on?

35:02.839 --> 35:04.319
How do you feel?
- Fine.

35:04.363 --> 35:06.582
- I'm gonna give you a warning
when the rope gets tight.

35:06.626 --> 35:07.757
- I'm scared.
- And I'll give you a pull.

35:07.801 --> 35:08.758
Okay.
- Good.

35:08.802 --> 35:10.151
- You guys ready?
- Yeah.

35:10.195 --> 35:12.284
- Here we go.

35:12.327 --> 35:14.677
- That is so funny.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.376
- Whoo!
- Nice work.

35:17.419 --> 35:18.420
- Whoo!
- There we go!

35:18.464 --> 35:20.248
- Yeah, Paris!

35:20.292 --> 35:21.554
- No problem.

35:23.077 --> 35:24.687
No, no, no, no!

35:26.385 --> 35:28.474
- Don't fall!
Paris!

35:28.517 --> 35:31.694
- Whoo!
- Paris, be careful!

35:33.522 --> 35:36.612
- Oh, my God.
I have my ring on.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.310
- Oh, your ring.

35:38.353 --> 35:39.789
- Paris!
- Good thing

35:39.833 --> 35:42.575
- You're wearing your
engagement ring in the water?

35:42.618 --> 35:45.621
I told you to take it off.
- Sorry, I forgot.

35:45.665 --> 35:48.015
- Be very careful
with the engagement ring.

35:48.058 --> 35:49.321
Paris.

35:49.364 --> 35:52.280
- Oh, my God.
- This is not gonna end well.

35:52.324 --> 35:55.196
- I want to show Carter that I
can have fun the Michigan way,

35:55.240 --> 35:57.503
but it's not something
I want to do all the time,

35:57.546 --> 35:59.157
and I hope he doesn't either.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.071
- That was amazing.
Good work.

36:01.115 --> 36:03.465
- All right, we gotta go
back to the dock,

36:03.509 --> 36:05.859
because we got more activities.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.295
- How many more activities?

36:07.339 --> 36:09.471
- I can't remember.
- Besides the wedding?

36:09.515 --> 36:10.907
- I think there were six
or eight of them.

36:18.437 --> 36:25.008
<i>♪</i>

36:25.052 --> 36:27.054
- Hi.

36:27.097 --> 36:30.100
- Our first wedding together.
- I know.

36:30.144 --> 36:31.493
- I already cried twice.

36:31.537 --> 36:33.103
This doesn't bode well
for our wedding.

36:33.147 --> 36:35.410
I think I'm gonna cry a lot.
Ready?

36:35.454 --> 36:37.238
- You look beautiful.
I love your dress.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.458
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much, of course.

36:40.894 --> 36:43.244
- I had to--I told you
I had to go get my fiancée.

36:43.288 --> 36:44.811
See?
It's the pretty blonde one.

36:44.854 --> 36:45.768
- Yes.
- And she's even

36:45.812 --> 36:46.769
a better person in here.

36:46.813 --> 36:47.814
That's why we love her.

36:47.857 --> 36:49.207
- Aw.
- Always smiling.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.557
They see the eyes.
They're always lit up.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.862
That's what I like.
Like, she--

36:52.906 --> 36:54.603
they say you marry your mom.

36:54.647 --> 36:56.083
She's a lot like my mom.

36:56.126 --> 36:57.258
- Well, I'm excited.
- Well, we'll have fun tonight.

36:57.302 --> 36:58.825
You gonna stick around
when she's DJing?

36:58.868 --> 37:00.305
You know she's DJing.

37:00.348 --> 37:03.525
The last wedding she did,
she got paid seven figures,

37:03.569 --> 37:08.617
so this is--and it was big, and
so this is her first wedding

37:08.661 --> 37:11.229
in Michigan, in the Midwest,
and just about anywhere.

37:11.272 --> 37:12.621
- Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly.

37:12.665 --> 37:14.797
- See, I thought
he's busting my chops.

37:14.841 --> 37:16.190
And I'm so naive and gullible.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.278
- Oh, no.
She's the highest-paid

37:17.322 --> 37:18.975
female DJ, among other things--

37:19.019 --> 37:22.457
<i>- I feel like Carter says that
to people who I meet.</i>

37:22.501 --> 37:25.460
<i>I just get super shy
and uncomfortable.</i>

37:25.504 --> 37:27.419
- The two things that Jay,
when they--

37:27.462 --> 37:30.030
when we first started dating,
he's like,

37:30.073 --> 37:32.293
"You'll DJ the wedding, right?"

37:32.337 --> 37:34.600
- Did he really?
- Yeah.

37:34.643 --> 37:36.558
<i>I've lived my whole life
for other people,</i>

37:36.602 --> 37:40.083
<i>and sometimes, I just wish
that I could just be normal.</i>

37:40.127 --> 37:42.172
And you know,
I'm grateful for everything,

37:42.216 --> 37:44.653
but it's a lot sometimes.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.312
<i>- Hello.
- Hi.</i>

37:51.356 --> 37:52.574
<i>- Are you wearing
a black dress?</i>

37:52.618 --> 37:54.750
- Yeah, are you not supposed
to wear black?

37:54.794 --> 37:56.665
<i>- To a summer wedding?</i>

37:56.709 --> 37:58.406
- Like, the whole family's,
like, in pink,

37:58.450 --> 38:00.495
and yellow, and, like, pastels,

38:00.539 --> 38:02.410
and I'm, like, in black,
like at a funeral.

38:02.454 --> 38:04.456
<i>- So how has it been?</i>

38:04.499 --> 38:08.677
- It's like "The Simple Life"
mixed with, like, I don't know.

38:08.721 --> 38:12.115
It looks like the Hamptons,
but then the stores suck.

38:14.074 --> 38:15.728
<i>- Is that Carter?</i>

38:15.771 --> 38:18.513
- No.
The whole family is very loud.

38:18.557 --> 38:20.776
<i>- How many people
are in the family?</i>

38:20.820 --> 38:22.996
- Lots.
They're so sweet,

38:23.039 --> 38:24.519
but they have so much energy.

38:24.563 --> 38:27.305
Like, they're like something
out of a movie,

38:27.348 --> 38:29.045
like--like Hallmark,

38:29.089 --> 38:32.048
those movies that are, like,
the nicest people in the world

38:32.092 --> 38:34.094
who are like, "I love you."

38:34.137 --> 38:35.095
And they're,
like, singing together.

38:35.138 --> 38:36.531
I really, really love them.

38:36.575 --> 38:40.753
I just feel bad,
because I'm not used to it.

38:40.796 --> 38:42.102
We live in L.A.

38:42.145 --> 38:43.886
Like, everyone's, like,
parents are divorced.

38:43.930 --> 38:44.887
They hate each other.

38:44.931 --> 38:46.411
<i>- But I think it's nice</i>

38:46.454 --> 38:48.935
<i>that he wants to go and
spend time with his family.</i>

38:48.978 --> 38:51.372
<i>Imagine if it was
the other way around,</i>

38:51.416 --> 38:55.202
<i>and he just didn't give
a about his family.</i>

38:55.245 --> 38:56.856
<i>That would be a red flag.</i>

38:56.899 --> 38:58.553
- He's gonna probably want to
do this the rest of his life.

38:58.597 --> 39:00.816
<i>- He does stuff all the time</i>

39:00.860 --> 39:03.253
<i>that I'm sure he does not
want to do.</i>

39:03.297 --> 39:05.343
<i>You have to compromise
and do things</i>

39:05.386 --> 39:07.127
<i>that you don't want
to do sometimes.</i>

39:07.170 --> 39:09.259
- But the things
I want to do are fun.

39:09.303 --> 39:11.261
I'm like,
"Let's go to this sick party.

39:11.305 --> 39:12.828
"Like, I'm DJing
this amazing event.

39:12.872 --> 39:14.221
"We're going to Vegas.

39:14.264 --> 39:15.744
I'm, like, DJing
the opening of a hotel."

39:15.788 --> 39:18.138
Like, that's fun.

39:18.181 --> 39:20.923
<i>- Well, that's fun for you.
Maybe it's not for him.</i>

39:20.967 --> 39:21.924
- <i>
- This is what</i>

39:21.968 --> 39:23.491
<i>you're marrying into.</i>

39:23.535 --> 39:26.755
- Is this what
growing up is about?

39:26.799 --> 39:29.062
<i>- Yeah.
- Ugh.</i>

39:29.105 --> 39:30.063
<i>- All right.
Have fun.</i>

39:30.106 --> 39:32.457
- Thanks.

39:32.500 --> 39:33.371
Ugh.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.028

39:39.072 --> 39:43.816

how lucky Jay is.

39:52.346 --> 39:53.434
You look stunning today.

39:53.478 --> 39:55.088
<i>- Jay and Eleni's wedding,</i>

39:55.131 --> 39:58.091
It's where my parents
were married 50 years prior,

39:58.134 --> 39:59.179
so it was kind of fun.

39:59.222 --> 40:00.180
I think we picked up a lot
from it.

40:00.223 --> 40:01.442
Right?
- Mm-hmm.

40:01.486 --> 40:03.226
- As I sat down
to write my vows,

40:03.270 --> 40:05.664
the most important love letter
of my life,

40:05.707 --> 40:08.449
I tried to recall the moment
when I knew you were the one.

40:08.493 --> 40:09.711
- They had really good vows.

40:19.852 --> 40:22.681
- We have to write our vows.
- Can you write mine for me?

40:22.724 --> 40:25.335
- I was about to ask you,
who's gonna write your vows,

40:25.379 --> 40:27.686
Charlotte or Nicky?
- You.

40:27.729 --> 40:28.861
- Exactly.

40:28.904 --> 40:30.645
- I now pronounce you husband
and wife.

40:30.689 --> 40:33.169
Jay, you may kiss your bride.

40:35.476 --> 40:39.349
<i>- ♪ I do, I do</i>

40:39.393 --> 40:42.396

40:45.312 --> 40:48.271
All right.
To the future!

40:48.315 --> 40:50.273
Jay!
Jay!

40:55.583 --> 40:57.846
<i>- It's pretty crazy that
my parents got married here</i>

40:57.890 --> 40:59.718
<i>54 years ago.</i>

40:59.761 --> 41:02.634
Can't tell you how many times
I've walked down this dock,

41:02.677 --> 41:04.462
7:00 in the morning
to water ski.

41:04.505 --> 41:06.942
- What is with you
and 7:00 in the morning?

41:06.986 --> 41:09.031
So you've been coming
to this house your whole life?

41:09.075 --> 41:12.513
- Forever and ever.

41:12.557 --> 41:14.515
<i>- He talks about it
all the time.</i>

41:14.559 --> 41:17.692
How his dad really loved
having them off the grid,

41:17.736 --> 41:19.389
and just being with the family,

41:19.433 --> 41:22.436
and doing, you know,
all these normal things.

41:24.046 --> 41:25.744
- My grandparents--
they would come out here

41:25.787 --> 41:27.572
and have a martini or dinner
at the end of the dock,

41:27.615 --> 41:30.488
and they would just kind of sit
and enjoy the sunshine

41:30.531 --> 41:31.967
and the sunset.

41:32.011 --> 41:33.316
- So cool.

41:33.360 --> 41:34.883
<i>I want to do that for him,
as well,</i>

41:34.927 --> 41:38.191
<i>but I'm used to going
to, like, Europe every summer,</i>

41:38.234 --> 41:40.802
and just--it's very different.

41:40.846 --> 41:42.978
<i>We'll go back,
but I just feel like</i>

41:43.022 --> 41:46.982
there just needs to be--
it needs to be fair.

41:47.026 --> 41:51.247
Like, not that it's bad.
I'm not saying that.

41:51.291 --> 41:53.206
I just would much
rather be in LA.

41:53.249 --> 41:55.338
- You know, I think
when it comes to raising kids,

41:55.382 --> 41:58.603
we're gonna have to find that
compromise, 'cause, you know,

41:58.646 --> 42:00.822
I want our children
to go to public school

42:00.866 --> 42:02.737
so they know
what real life is like.

42:02.781 --> 42:03.999
She'll probably want them to go

42:04.043 --> 42:05.827
to the same private school
she went to.

42:05.871 --> 42:08.656
You know,
we got our work cut out for us.

42:08.700 --> 42:12.617
It's hard to believe,
three months from now,

42:12.660 --> 42:14.793
you and I are gonna be
walking down that aisle.

42:15.837 --> 42:18.448
So don't you think we should
bring our future kids here?

42:18.492 --> 42:20.494
They get to hang out
with their cousins.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.409
- Mm-hmm.
- We could try to bring up

42:22.452 --> 42:24.280
children in a way
that feels normal.

42:24.324 --> 42:25.586
Like, going to the Dairy Queen

42:25.630 --> 42:27.153
or going
to the ice cream place.

42:27.196 --> 42:31.940
- Yeah, but as a kid, like,

42:31.984 --> 42:35.683
growing up in the Hamptons
or just Malibu only--

42:35.727 --> 42:37.859
it's--

42:37.903 --> 42:41.123
I feel like I've never really
done normal things like this,

42:41.167 --> 42:42.560
so it's so different.

42:42.603 --> 42:43.735
- If you have places
like Malibu and the Hamptons--

42:43.778 --> 42:45.780
just aren't real life,
you know?

42:45.824 --> 42:47.129
- Yeah.

42:47.173 --> 42:50.002
- Otherwise, they're gonna be
little monsters.

43:01.579 --> 43:06.409
<i>- ♪ I'm gonna love you

43:13.286 --> 43:14.722

43:14.766 --> 43:16.637
two more songs, I think,
and then you.

43:16.681 --> 43:18.900
This one and one more.
- Did they do a soundcheck?

43:18.944 --> 43:21.337
- Guys, we might

43:21.381 --> 43:22.643
- I don't want to, like,
get up, and press play,

43:22.687 --> 43:23.731
and it not work.

43:23.775 --> 43:25.167
Pray that it works.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.258
- You'll do just fine.

43:29.302 --> 43:31.696
- All right.
Just five minute intermission,

43:31.739 --> 43:33.959
then the DJ's coming on.

43:36.135 --> 43:38.659
- Babe.
- All right...

43:38.703 --> 43:39.834
- I handed it to him earlier.

43:39.878 --> 43:41.619
- I'll tell stories about Jay.

43:41.662 --> 43:44.360
- They should put
other music on while this is--

43:44.404 --> 43:47.407
- Should I put something on?
- Yeah, anything.

43:47.450 --> 43:49.409
Why would they not
have music set up already?

43:49.452 --> 43:51.585
- No idea.
- I told them a thousand times.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.761
They don't even have
the equipment set up.

43:53.805 --> 43:57.112
They're trying to set it up.

43:57.156 --> 43:58.984
- Beyond.
- I would be dying.

43:59.027 --> 44:01.943
- I'm dying.
Now the vibe is dead.

44:01.987 --> 44:04.032
- Tough crowd.
Tough crowd.

44:04.076 --> 44:05.555
- When are you going on?

44:05.599 --> 44:07.732
- As soon as they
set up the equipment.

44:07.775 --> 44:08.863
- What the
are they doing?

44:08.907 --> 44:10.169
- They don't know
what they're doing.

44:10.212 --> 44:13.041
I just--I explained this
to them when I got here.

44:13.085 --> 44:15.740
Like, "Please do a sound check
to make sure."

44:15.783 --> 44:17.567
- You got it.
You're gonna be amazing.

44:17.611 --> 44:18.699
- I hope it works.

44:18.743 --> 44:22.572
- Also, low expectations, so--

44:22.616 --> 44:25.140
- I'm so frustrated.
I asked them several times

44:25.184 --> 44:26.968
to make sure to do
a sound check

44:27.012 --> 44:28.666
and that all the equipment
is set up.

44:28.709 --> 44:31.320
This is a very complicated
piece of machinery

44:31.364 --> 44:33.018
that needs to be hooked up
in the correct way.

44:33.061 --> 44:36.586
You can't just plug it in
like it's a radio.

44:36.630 --> 44:38.240
Does it work?
Hello?

44:38.284 --> 44:39.938
It's not working.
Babe?

44:39.981 --> 44:42.680
- Grab the mic!

44:42.723 --> 44:45.987
- I don't need someone taking
a video and making fun of me

44:46.031 --> 44:47.989
because it wasn't
set up properly.

44:48.033 --> 44:50.209
And I've, you know,
been burned in the past

44:50.252 --> 44:52.994
with people messing up
the sound or something,

44:53.038 --> 44:54.474
and of course,
I'm getting blamed.

44:54.517 --> 44:59.131
- Can everyone make her feel
at home in Traverse City?

44:59.174 --> 45:03.396
If I can get everybody
on the dance floor!

45:03.439 --> 45:04.702
- Babe--

45:04.745 --> 45:06.791
- All right,
let's hear a round of applause.

45:06.834 --> 45:10.446
- Babe, does it work?
- In two minutes, from LA...

45:10.490 --> 45:17.540
- Does it work?
- DJ Paris Hilton!

45:17.584 --> 45:19.760
Whoo!

45:19.804 --> 45:21.196
Come on, let's hear it!

45:21.240 --> 45:22.981
Crowd's forming.
- Babe!

45:23.024 --> 45:25.635
- The excitement is building.

45:25.679 --> 45:27.289
- Carter, it's not working.

45:27.333 --> 45:29.901
Why are you doing this
and announcing me to go up?

45:29.944 --> 45:31.772
I look
like a idiot now.

45:31.816 --> 45:33.339
- They told me it was working.
- It's not working.

45:33.382 --> 45:34.427
- I don't know
what to tell you.

45:34.470 --> 45:35.645
- So beyond.

45:35.689 --> 45:38.431
- I'm told the sound
technicians actually

45:38.474 --> 45:41.260
don't have it working,
so we're gonna--

45:41.303 --> 45:42.827
- I'm not going till it works.

45:42.870 --> 45:44.611
It's beyond.

45:44.654 --> 45:46.265
- And then we'll figure
it out here.

45:46.308 --> 45:48.746
I just kept saying to Paris,
"I know, I know, I know.

45:48.789 --> 45:50.748
"We haven't done a sound check,

45:50.791 --> 45:52.314
<i>"but it's a family wedding
in Michigan.</i>

45:52.358 --> 45:53.751
<i>"You know, we're not
playing Tomorrowland,</i>

45:53.794 --> 45:56.101
<i>so let's just
take it a little easy."</i>

45:56.144 --> 45:57.711
<i>And she's
such a perfectionist,</i>

45:57.755 --> 45:59.365
<i>and she wanted to know
if we had done a sound check.</i>

45:59.408 --> 46:01.410
I was like, "Of course not."

46:01.454 --> 46:03.064
- Obviously,
this isn't Tomorrowland

46:03.108 --> 46:05.675
or a big show, but still.

46:05.719 --> 46:08.287
I take pride in what I do.
That's what pissed me off.

46:08.330 --> 46:09.810
I was like--he's like,
"Everyone, come here."

46:09.854 --> 46:11.725
And I'm like, "It's not ready,
mother[bleep]!"

46:11.769 --> 46:13.814
Carter had to make a big scene.
This is beyond.

46:13.858 --> 46:15.250
- I was just trying to keep
their energy going.

46:15.294 --> 46:16.904
- I know,
but now that makes me look bad.

46:16.948 --> 46:18.253
- It doesn't, P.
I mean, I'm--

46:18.297 --> 46:19.428
- Explain they don't know
what they're doing.

46:19.472 --> 46:21.082
- I've explained
seven times, P.

46:21.126 --> 46:22.475
I don't know what to tell you.

46:23.955 --> 46:26.261
- Oh, my God.

46:26.305 --> 46:29.134
I told them to do
a sound check all day.

46:29.177 --> 46:32.311
I knew this would happen.

46:32.354 --> 46:34.617
I just wish they would have had
everyone go drink over there

46:34.661 --> 46:37.359
until it was ready instead of
making me look like an idiot.

46:37.403 --> 46:39.797
By the time I play now,
it's gonna be humiliating,

46:39.840 --> 46:41.320
because it's so beyond.

46:42.843 --> 46:44.584
- No, I want to DJ,
but it's embarrassing.

46:44.627 --> 46:46.020
That's--I want to,

46:46.064 --> 46:47.500
but I wish you didn't tell
everyone to get up there.

46:47.543 --> 46:48.762
We would have had it ready,
and then they can come.

46:51.330 --> 46:52.418
- Well, I mean if it doesn't
really work,

46:52.461 --> 46:53.680
I'm gonna feel
like a moron.

46:53.723 --> 46:54.986
- I hear you.

46:55.508 --> 46:56.770
There it is.

46:56.814 --> 46:58.293
- Is it working?
- Yeah.

46:58.337 --> 47:00.513
- All right.
Let's hope it works.

47:04.822 --> 47:07.694
- Get up there and do it.
- I hope it's working.

47:09.914 --> 47:11.654
I can't here.

47:11.698 --> 47:13.047
Oh, now it's working.

47:13.091 --> 47:15.310
Who has the microphone?
Is this working?

47:15.354 --> 47:17.486
Hello?
Hello?

47:19.662 --> 47:22.100
Hello.
Sorry about that, guys.

47:22.143 --> 47:24.363
All right, let's pretend
that didn't happen.

47:24.406 --> 47:27.366
Just want to say I am so happy
to be here tonight,

47:27.409 --> 47:29.020
back in Traverse City,

47:29.063 --> 47:32.023
for another Milliken
family tradition

47:32.066 --> 47:37.767
of all getting together
for the legends, Jay and Eleni.

47:37.811 --> 47:39.204
Yes.

47:39.247 --> 47:41.336
You guys are such
a beautiful couple.

47:41.380 --> 47:43.208
I love the way you lift
each other up,

47:43.251 --> 47:45.340
and you're best friends,
and have so much fun together,

47:45.384 --> 47:47.865
and laugh,
and just have the best time.

47:47.908 --> 47:50.911
And I love having you
as part of my family

47:50.955 --> 47:52.043
and being part of yours.

47:52.086 --> 47:54.132
- Let's go!
- Let's do this.

47:54.175 --> 47:55.263
<i>♪ Give me some, good</i>

47:55.307 --> 47:56.874
<i>♪ Don't stop</i>

47:56.917 --> 47:58.963
<i>♪ Let's rock</i>

47:59.006 --> 48:00.703
<i>♪ On top</i>

48:00.747 --> 48:01.966
<i>♪ Give me some,
give me some ♪</i>

48:02.009 --> 48:03.010
<i>♪ Give me some, good</i>

48:03.054 --> 48:04.359
<i>♪ Don't stop</i>

48:04.751 --> 48:06.971
<i>♪ On the beat, on the drum,
give me some ♪</i>

48:08.929 --> 48:10.148
- Want to dance?
- Yeah.

48:10.191 --> 48:12.280
We're having a good time
over here, right?

48:28.166 --> 48:29.297
- I played this song for you.

48:30.908 --> 48:31.821
- What?

48:34.824 --> 48:37.566
- I yelled at him and him.

48:37.610 --> 48:39.786
- They fixed it,
so it's all good.

48:42.049 --> 48:46.053
I think I'm just so
stressed out and so exhausted,

48:46.097 --> 48:48.969
and just the wedding's
really coming up.

48:49.013 --> 48:50.275
<i>It's, like, in seven weeks,</i>

48:50.318 --> 48:52.581
<i>'cause there's just
so much pressure,</i>

48:52.625 --> 48:54.757
<i>and things are
just moving so fast,</i>

48:54.801 --> 48:56.368
<i>and it's just
too much going on.</i>

48:56.411 --> 48:59.806
And my mom is pushing things
on me that I don't want to do.

48:59.849 --> 49:02.983
It's causing a lot of stress,
especially for Carter and I.

49:03.027 --> 49:06.595
Like, we've never argued
in our entire relationship,

49:06.639 --> 49:09.511
and, you know,
just the past couple days,

49:09.555 --> 49:13.254
I just feel like we're both
in just such a bad mood.
