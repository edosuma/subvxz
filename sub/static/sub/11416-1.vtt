01:45.011 --> 01:47.412
Daddy! Daddy!

01:49.712 --> 01:52.412
Me and wicket
are going back to the village now!

01:52.712 --> 01:55.012
Tell your mother
l got the main unit repaired!

01:55.212 --> 01:57.113
It shouldn't be long now.

02:01.413 --> 02:04.013
- Cindel leave soon?
- I guess so.

02:04.213 --> 02:06.314
The star cruiser's almost fixed.

02:06.514 --> 02:08.514
We're gonna have to say goodbye.

02:08.714 --> 02:10.614
Goodbye?

02:10.814 --> 02:12.914
That's what you say
when your friends go away.

02:13.114 --> 02:15.015
"Goodbye" not good.

02:15.215 --> 02:17.515
I don't wanna leave here, wicket...

02:17.715 --> 02:20.015
but we can finally go home.

02:20.215 --> 02:23.916
- Home?
- It's where we live. It's far away.

02:24.216 --> 02:25.916
Why go?

02:26.016 --> 02:29.016
For one thing,
my brother and I could go to school.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.116
School?

02:31.216 --> 02:33.317
It's where you go to learn things.

02:33.517 --> 02:35.417
Cindel learn here with wicket.

02:45.518 --> 02:49.718
No, silly.
I have to learn grown-up things.

02:50.018 --> 02:52.019
Mmm! Wicket go to school.

02:52.219 --> 02:54.419
Yes! You could come with us!

02:55.619 --> 02:58.019
No. Ewok live here.

02:58.219 --> 03:00.019
Wicket family here.

03:00.219 --> 03:02.620
Don't worry. I won't be gone forever.

03:02.820 --> 03:05.520
I'll come back and visit you
as soon as I can.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.620
Yes, yes!
Cindel come back, visit wicket.

03:10.121 --> 03:12.121
Come!

03:19.322 --> 03:21.122
- What's wrong?
- Shh.

03:21.322 --> 03:23.122
Danger.

03:38.724 --> 03:39.724
Oh!

04:54.732 --> 04:56.632
Cindel stay.

05:04.333 --> 05:07.233
- Mommy.

05:19.034 --> 05:22.635
<i>Mace! Mace!</i>

05:22.835 --> 05:24.935
Get back, Cindel!

05:25.135 --> 05:28.035
- Mommy!
- Stay away!

05:28.335 --> 05:31.036
Get help! Get Dad!

06:08.440 --> 06:10.540
Daddy! Daddy!

06:15.441 --> 06:18.641
My lord Terak wants what you
have concealed from him.

06:20.941 --> 06:23.841
<i>He will get what he desires.</i>

06:24.042 --> 06:26.042
- Wait a minute.

06:44.344 --> 06:46.344
I want the power.

06:46.544 --> 06:49.144
You will give it to me now.

06:49.344 --> 06:51.344
I don't... I haven't got anything
that's valuable here.

06:51.544 --> 06:53.545
<i>We're... We're strangers here. We just...</i>

06:53.745 --> 06:57.445
Is this not the hidden ship?
Are you not the guardian of the power?

06:57.645 --> 07:00.145
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:11.247 --> 07:13.647
- No, please don't. No, please...

07:21.348 --> 07:25.548
The power. I have the power!

08:00.552 --> 08:03.052
- Are you all right, sweetheart?
- Mm-hmm.

08:03.252 --> 08:05.052
Mommy, Mace, they're dead.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.153
I know, honey. I know.

08:08.453 --> 08:12.153
- I'm scared.
- So am I.

08:12.453 --> 08:14.253
But we have to be strong now.

08:14.353 --> 08:16.654
Do you understand that?

08:16.854 --> 08:20.154
Do you remember the story
l used to tell you...

08:20.454 --> 08:22.254
about the little bird...

08:22.454 --> 08:24.855
that got blown out of his nest
during a storm?

08:25.055 --> 08:28.055
He had to fly for the first time, didn't he?

08:28.255 --> 08:31.355
That's right. He flew and he flew...

08:31.555 --> 08:36.256
and, finally, after the storm,
he found his way home.

08:36.655 --> 08:38.756
Now, honey, I want you to find Deej.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.756
The Ewoks will help you.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.557
- No, Daddy. I want to stay with you.
- No, sweetheart.

08:46.857 --> 08:49.957
You can't do that.
You have to go on without me.

08:50.157 --> 08:52.758
You have to be like that little bird
and fly away.

08:52.958 --> 08:55.758
- I won't.
- Now, listen, Cindel, you will.

08:55.958 --> 08:58.258
Now, you do as I say.

08:58.458 --> 09:01.359
When I say go, you run.

09:02.859 --> 09:04.759
Okay?

09:08.659 --> 09:11.560
Cindel, I'll always be with you.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.360
I'll always be with you.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.460
I love you.

09:24.961 --> 09:27.061
Don't look back. Just run fast. Run!

10:07.166 --> 10:10.766
There's no escape for you, my little one.

10:19.967 --> 10:24.067
You are a pretty prize.

10:34.669 --> 10:37.969
- Oh, wicket. It's you!
- Cindel!

11:42.876 --> 11:46.676
My family... they're all dead.

11:46.876 --> 11:50.977
What happens to me now, wicket?
I'm all alone.

11:53.777 --> 11:56.577
Wicket take care of Cindel.

11:57.878 --> 11:59.878
My family.

12:00.978 --> 12:03.078
Wicket Cindel's family now.

12:03.278 --> 12:06.979
- Ewoks family now.

12:07.179 --> 12:11.279
Cindel live. Wicket live.
Must have hope.

12:11.579 --> 12:13.579
Must escape.

12:19.980 --> 12:22.480
- Shh, shh, shh!

12:50.083 --> 12:52.484
What did he say?

12:52.684 --> 12:55.584
Hole too small. Ewok too big.

12:58.284 --> 13:02.385
I can fit. And he could fit.
I know he could.

13:02.685 --> 13:05.185
Wicket fit.

13:12.886 --> 13:15.386
Cindel, hurry.

13:21.487 --> 13:23.287
One, two, three.

13:23.487 --> 13:24.887
- Go!
- Oh!

13:28.887 --> 13:30.288
Ohhh!

13:39.789 --> 13:41.689
We go!

14:13.792 --> 14:15.693
Hurry, Cindel!

14:35.795 --> 14:37.995
Whoa! Ohhh! Oh!

14:59.497 --> 15:02.198
Cindel, in here!

15:05.398 --> 15:07.298
Oh!

15:22.600 --> 15:24.500
Safe now.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.900
But we're trapped!

15:27.100 --> 15:29.100
Find way out.

15:53.303 --> 15:55.203
Look.

15:55.403 --> 15:57.504
Back. Back, Cindel.

15:57.704 --> 16:01.204
Oh, no!

16:01.404 --> 16:03.604
We can't get down this way.

16:04.704 --> 16:07.305
Trouble. Big trouble.

16:21.006 --> 16:22.906
Hmm. Mm!

16:27.307 --> 16:29.207
Aha!

17:08.511 --> 17:11.912
Hmm. Hmm.

17:13.212 --> 17:15.112
Ah!

17:23.512 --> 17:26.913
Oh! Mmm. Hmm.

17:27.113 --> 17:29.413
<i>Oh!</i>

17:51.816 --> 17:56.816
Cindel, help! Help, Cindel!

17:57.116 --> 17:58.717
Wicket!

18:01.017 --> 18:02.917
Ohhh!

18:14.718 --> 18:17.019
Run, wicket! Run!

18:17.219 --> 18:20.319
Hyah! Oh!

18:25.620 --> 18:27.920
- Oh, no!

18:42.021 --> 18:43.922
- <i>Cindel!</i>

18:47.022 --> 18:48.922
<i>Cindel! Cindel!</i>

19:06.424 --> 19:07.724
Cindel!

19:07.824 --> 19:10.424
Wicket! Wicket!

19:10.624 --> 19:12.825
Ohhh!

19:18.125 --> 19:20.425
Help! Help!

19:29.326 --> 19:31.227
- Oh!

19:31.427 --> 19:34.327
- Cindel, I coming!

19:34.527 --> 19:36.827
Whoaaa!

19:40.328 --> 19:42.228
Oh! Cindel!

19:43.528 --> 19:46.128
<i>Hold on! Hold on!</i>

19:55.229 --> 19:56.829
Whoa-oh-oh-ohhh!

20:06.530 --> 20:08.431
Oh!

20:11.931 --> 20:13.731
Come!

20:44.635 --> 20:46.435
Cindel safe now.

20:55.636 --> 20:59.536
- Look. Go. Hide here.

21:07.137 --> 21:09.137
Ahhh.

21:53.842 --> 21:57.742
- What's that?
- Trouble.

21:58.042 --> 22:00.743
- Huh?

22:00.943 --> 22:02.543
Got you.

22:24.145 --> 22:27.546
- Nooo!

22:27.846 --> 22:29.846
He could help us.

22:30.046 --> 22:32.246
Him help? Humph.

22:32.446 --> 22:34.546
Maybe he knows where we can find food.

22:34.746 --> 22:37.147
Food, food, food.

22:37.347 --> 22:39.747
I think he understands.

22:39.947 --> 22:43.347
<i>We're hungry.</i>
<i>Could you help us find some food?</i>

22:48.448 --> 22:50.748
- Let's go.

23:07.150 --> 23:09.150
Over there!

23:19.251 --> 23:21.151
- Over there!
- Okay.

23:28.152 --> 23:29.952
Mmm.

23:32.753 --> 23:34.453
What that?

23:35.753 --> 23:37.953
<i>l think it's a house.</i>

23:54.955 --> 23:56.955
Ahhh.

23:59.556 --> 24:01.456
Careful.

24:05.556 --> 24:08.357
If somebody does live in here,
they sure are messy.

24:08.557 --> 24:10.357
Yep, yep. Messy.

24:27.459 --> 24:30.859
What this? So much junk.

24:31.059 --> 24:32.959
Hmm. Huh.

24:33.959 --> 24:36.760
Ohhh.

24:40.760 --> 24:44.661
I guess the people moved away
and left all this junk behind.

24:47.761 --> 24:50.861
Wicket! Wicket!

24:51.061 --> 24:53.861
- Hmm?
- If nobody lives here any more...

24:54.062 --> 24:56.662
we can clean up
and this could be our house.

24:56.962 --> 24:59.262
Yes, yes, Cindel. Our house.

25:25.865 --> 25:27.765
Uh-oh.

25:37.766 --> 25:40.367
- How'd you get here?

25:40.567 --> 25:43.667
- He brought us here.
- He did, uh-huh.

25:45.067 --> 25:46.667
- <i>You nasty little bug-lover!</i>

25:46.867 --> 25:50.068
I've told you and I've told you. I don't
want no strangers around this place!

25:50.268 --> 25:52.168
<i>You brought 'em here</i>
<i>and you don't even know who they are!</i>

25:52.368 --> 25:54.668
- Who are you?
- My name is Cindel.

25:54.868 --> 25:57.868
- Yeah? Well, who's that?
- Wicket.

25:58.168 --> 26:00.069
Humph. Wicket.

26:00.169 --> 26:03.269
Oh. You've been messing with my stuff.

26:03.569 --> 26:06.269
All right. You brought 'em here.
Now you get 'em out of here.

26:06.469 --> 26:09.070
- I don't want you here! Get out!

26:09.270 --> 26:11.070
No place to go.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.870
I don't care about that.

26:14.070 --> 26:17.671
Now, you take him and go! Go on!

26:17.971 --> 26:19.771
Come on, wicket.
He doesn't want us here.

26:19.871 --> 26:22.071
He's just a mean old man, anyway.
Come on.

26:23.771 --> 26:26.171
- Come on.
- Skedaddle!

26:26.371 --> 26:28.372
I'll deal with you in a minute!

26:28.572 --> 26:30.872
What do we do now, wicket?

26:31.072 --> 26:33.472
Night soon. Rest here.

26:33.672 --> 26:35.572
Safe.

26:37.973 --> 26:40.573
Strangers.
Teek, you oughta know better!

26:40.773 --> 26:43.973
<i>This is my house, these are my things.</i>

26:45.474 --> 26:47.474
Don't want no strangers around here.

26:49.274 --> 26:52.674
<i>Besides, if I did let 'em stay...</i>

26:52.974 --> 26:56.075
First thing you know,
they'd wanna be friends or something.

26:56.275 --> 26:59.875
- And then look at the trouble we'd have!

27:02.375 --> 27:04.976
I'm cold, wicket.

27:05.176 --> 27:07.276
Mm. Cold.

27:07.476 --> 27:09.676
I'm hungry too.

27:09.876 --> 27:12.276
Wicket hungry too.

27:14.277 --> 27:16.877
You don't know who those people are
and you don't know what they're up to.

27:17.077 --> 27:19.677
And it could be some kind of trick!

27:19.877 --> 27:22.078
<i>l know you get lonesome.</i>
<i>You think I don't?</i>

27:23.978 --> 27:27.178
<i>What's this?</i>
<i>Now, what do we got here?</i>

27:29.178 --> 27:32.079
Some kind of porridge.
You make this?

27:32.279 --> 27:35.579
- Oh, look here.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.479
<i>Some kind of...</i>

27:38.779 --> 27:40.480
Some kind of little muffins.

27:40.580 --> 27:42.280
<i>Shall we have some?</i>

27:42.480 --> 27:44.380
All right.

27:55.481 --> 27:57.381
<i>Ahhh!</i>

28:01.982 --> 28:04.082
My golly. That looks good.

28:09.683 --> 28:11.683
Dig in.

28:14.183 --> 28:15.983
Take all you want...

28:16.183 --> 28:17.984
but don't let me catch you
giving none of them muffins...

28:18.184 --> 28:20.884
to them little beggars outside,
you hear me?

28:29.785 --> 28:31.985
I'm going over to that stove
and get me some more soup.

28:32.185 --> 28:34.485
<i>Whatever you do...</i>

28:35.785 --> 28:37.786
You stay right where you are.

28:52.287 --> 28:53.887
Mmm.

28:53.987 --> 28:55.688
- Thank you.

28:55.888 --> 28:57.788
Mmm.

29:10.489 --> 29:12.589
You are hungry.

29:12.789 --> 29:14.390
Mm-hmm!

29:32.992 --> 29:35.692
Aieee! Aieee!

29:35.892 --> 29:38.992
- Oh! Help, Cindel! Help!

29:49.393 --> 29:51.594
<i>Thank you for building the fire.</i>

29:51.794 --> 29:53.694
I'm so glad you're here.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.094
Yeah.

29:57.294 --> 30:00.395
You know what?
You're my best friend.

30:00.695 --> 30:04.195
Mm. Yes. Best friend.

30:04.395 --> 30:08.195
All right, what are you two little wood rats
trying to do, burn down the whole forest?

30:08.496 --> 30:10.096
But I was cold.

30:10.196 --> 30:13.596
I ain't gonna let you build one of these fires
unless you build it in the fireplace.

30:19.897 --> 30:21.997
Proper place for a fire is the fireplace...

30:22.197 --> 30:23.997
so you can have this fire tonight...

30:24.197 --> 30:26.197
but tomorrow you gotta go,
you understand me?

30:28.998 --> 30:30.798
What's your name?

30:30.998 --> 30:32.698
Noa.

30:32.898 --> 30:34.798
Goodnight, Noa.

30:34.998 --> 30:36.799
<i>Goodnight.</i>

30:45.199 --> 30:47.300
Thank you.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.400
Thank you.

30:55.801 --> 30:59.001
- Goodnight, Teek.

30:59.201 --> 31:01.001
Now, get to bed.

31:46.906 --> 31:49.506
Help, Noa! Help! Help!

31:52.107 --> 31:53.707
Wicket!

31:53.907 --> 31:55.907
<i>Wicket! They're here!</i>

31:56.107 --> 31:58.607
- What's the matter?
- They're gonna get me. They're here!

31:58.807 --> 32:01.708
- Who's here? What's going on over here?
- The bad men!

32:01.908 --> 32:04.008
Ohhh. You've been dreaming, honey.

32:05.308 --> 32:07.308
You've had a bad dream is what you've had.

32:07.508 --> 32:09.609
Now, there's nobody gonna bother you.

32:09.809 --> 32:13.409
Old Noa will look after you.
You're safe here now.

32:13.709 --> 32:16.709
I'll put you in this soft bed,
cover you up...

32:16.909 --> 32:19.910
<i>and you can sleep the night there, okay?</i>

32:20.110 --> 32:22.910
- All right. You too. Come on.
- Me too?

32:23.210 --> 32:25.110
Up you go.

32:27.311 --> 32:29.211
- You'll be all right.
- Thank you.

32:30.711 --> 32:33.211
- See what you done now?

32:33.411 --> 32:35.711
<i>Look what we're into.</i>

32:38.212 --> 32:41.512
We got a lot better things to do, you know,
than look after these little bounders.

32:41.712 --> 32:44.112
- <i>Somebody somewhere</i>
<i>is worrying about 'em.</i>

32:45.312 --> 32:47.213
And come daylight...

32:47.413 --> 32:49.313
they're gonna have to go.

33:14.016 --> 33:15.916
Oh. Morning.

33:23.217 --> 33:26.917
All right. I think now it's time for you two
to run along home.

33:27.217 --> 33:29.717
I know there's somebody
worrying about you.

33:47.419 --> 33:49.519
- Good morning.
- We go?

33:49.719 --> 33:53.320
- Where will we go?
- Family need wicket.

33:53.620 --> 33:55.720
But we don't know
where they are.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.820
We find!

34:24.623 --> 34:26.023
Mm.

34:38.125 --> 34:43.025
I really think it would be better
if we left them out of this.

34:43.324 --> 34:45.225
I mean, this is a strange power.

34:45.425 --> 34:47.426
It's... It's different.

34:47.626 --> 34:50.226
It <i>is</i> the power I've searched for.

34:50.426 --> 34:52.226
Surely.

34:52.426 --> 34:55.427
This is the power the star traveller spoke of.

34:55.627 --> 34:58.627
Yes. We have only to learn its secrets.

35:01.827 --> 35:03.927
I have waited long enough.

35:04.127 --> 35:06.228
You will discover its magic...

35:06.428 --> 35:08.228
or die.

35:09.528 --> 35:11.328
Ohhh.

35:11.428 --> 35:13.929
If only you hadn't let that child escape.

35:14.229 --> 35:16.329
She must know its secrets.

35:16.429 --> 35:19.729
How dare you suggest that I am to blame.

35:20.029 --> 35:21.929
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

35:22.129 --> 35:25.030
- I didn't mean that, uh...
- Find the little one...

35:25.230 --> 35:27.630
and I might forgive such insolence.

35:27.830 --> 35:29.330
But how can I?

35:29.530 --> 35:32.631
Find me that child!

35:32.831 --> 35:35.331
Find me that child!

35:38.831 --> 35:42.332
<i>Find me that child!</i>

36:14.535 --> 36:16.635
Where you hiding, you little rug rats?

36:19.036 --> 36:20.836
Come down here!

36:23.536 --> 36:25.436
<i>Come on. I got something for you.</i>

36:26.536 --> 36:28.337
<i>Oh, hiya, Teek.</i>

36:31.237 --> 36:33.037
They gone, huh?

36:35.237 --> 36:37.038
Well, good riddance.

36:37.138 --> 36:40.138
I didn't want 'em here anyway. They
would've brought us nothing but trouble.

36:40.438 --> 36:42.438
You understand? Trouble.

36:42.638 --> 36:45.338
<i>Eating all the food in the house.</i>

36:45.538 --> 36:47.539
<i>Messing things up.</i>

36:47.739 --> 36:49.739
Better off without 'em.

36:55.039 --> 36:57.940
Shh. I thought maybe you needed a new
bed, and I forgot how big you were...

36:58.140 --> 37:01.440
so I made two of them...
one that size and one that size.

37:01.640 --> 37:03.840
- <i>See which one suits you.</i>

37:05.841 --> 37:08.941
It's a good thing they were gone
when I come home!

37:10.241 --> 37:12.541
I would a throwed 'em out on their ear.

37:12.741 --> 37:15.442
<i>Noa! Noa!</i>

37:15.642 --> 37:18.542
Look what we've been picking.
We can make a pie.

37:18.742 --> 37:21.142
Well, don't make a mess, you hear me?

37:23.443 --> 37:25.343
And you either!

37:26.343 --> 37:28.543
- Okay?
- Okay.

37:28.743 --> 37:30.743
<i>Okay then.</i>

37:37.144 --> 37:39.644
- Mmm!

37:42.845 --> 37:45.445
Night-night, Teek.

37:52.246 --> 37:56.946
<i>Teek! Stay outta those pies</i>
<i>and save some for tomorrow!</i>

37:57.246 --> 37:59.946
Mm. Ohhh. Tired.

38:01.247 --> 38:03.347
Those were awful good pies, Cindel.

38:03.547 --> 38:05.447
Best I ever had.

38:07.447 --> 38:10.548
- One for you.
- Oh. Thank you.

38:10.848 --> 38:13.048
Thanks, Noa, for letting us stay.

38:15.348 --> 38:16.948
Yep.

38:18.148 --> 38:20.449
- Goodnight, Noa.
- Goodnight now.

38:43.051 --> 38:45.151
All right now.
If you're gonna stay here with me...

38:45.351 --> 38:47.152
you're gonna make yourselves useful.

38:47.252 --> 38:50.152
You're gonna wash the dishes
and make the beds and clean the house...

38:50.452 --> 38:52.652
and it's gonna be spotless when I get home.

38:52.852 --> 38:55.653
- And, Teek, see they do it.

38:57.553 --> 39:00.653
I wonder where he goes every day.

39:00.853 --> 39:03.753
- <i>l guess, but where?</i>

39:03.953 --> 39:06.754
- I dunno.
- Let's follow him and see.

39:07.054 --> 39:09.054
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
No, no, no, no.

39:09.154 --> 39:10.954
Make bed. Dishes.

39:12.254 --> 39:14.455
W we’ll do those, but later.

39:14.655 --> 39:16.555
Okay.

39:23.255 --> 39:25.856
- Come on.
- Okay, okay.

40:31.363 --> 40:33.563
Oh. Look what it is.

40:36.363 --> 40:39.964
- Big bush!
- I mean under it.

40:42.364 --> 40:44.164
I dunno.

40:44.364 --> 40:46.164
Let's go look closer.

40:56.866 --> 41:01.166
Oh. Cindel, Cindel. Look.
Bush... Bush has window.

41:04.266 --> 41:06.267
Wicket, it's a star cruiser.

41:06.467 --> 41:10.067
Star cruiser? Star cruiser...

41:10.367 --> 41:12.167
Star cruiser crash!

41:12.367 --> 41:15.068
Star cruiser whoosh!

41:15.268 --> 41:17.168
Star cruiser crash, crash!

41:17.368 --> 41:19.368
Star cruiser... Oh!

41:21.568 --> 41:24.069
<i>Oh! What are you two kids doing here?</i>

41:24.369 --> 41:26.169
You shouldn't come around here!
It's dangerous!

41:26.269 --> 41:28.469
- Wicket sorry.
- You could get hurt!

41:28.669 --> 41:30.469
Nobody comes here, not even Teek!

41:30.669 --> 41:32.569
- <i>Help!</i>
- And I got worse traps than this
around here!

41:35.370 --> 41:37.570
- I'm sorry.

41:37.770 --> 41:40.770
- Well, you should be sorry now.

41:40.970 --> 41:42.771
- You all right?
- All right.

41:42.971 --> 41:45.271
- <i>Awww, come here!</i>

41:47.271 --> 41:49.371
All right. I'm sorry.
But you shouldn't have been here.

41:49.571 --> 41:51.472
And you neither!

41:54.572 --> 41:56.472
Let's get this rope off your foot.

41:57.972 --> 41:59.772
Hold still!

42:08.373 --> 42:10.274
How'd you get here?

42:12.074 --> 42:13.574
A long time ago.

42:14.974 --> 42:16.774
My friend Salak and I.

42:16.974 --> 42:20.575
<i>We were a couple of young fellas</i>
<i>out to tear up the galaxy.</i>

42:20.875 --> 42:24.175
Ha. On our first mission, we crashed... here.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.675
I've been here ever since.
I don't even know how long I've been here.

42:26.875 --> 42:29.676
- Where's your friend?
- I don't know.

42:29.876 --> 42:33.276
See, when we crashed,
the crystal in our power drive shattered...

42:33.576 --> 42:35.376
and he went off in search of another one.

42:35.576 --> 42:38.477
- I stayed here.
- Ahhh.

42:38.677 --> 42:40.677
And I've been here ever since.

42:41.877 --> 42:45.377
My friend, Salak, he's not coming back.

42:45.677 --> 42:48.978
I know that now.
I guess I've known it a long, long time.

42:55.878 --> 42:57.779
So we'll stay here.

43:45.284 --> 43:47.184
Oh! Ow!

44:07.786 --> 44:10.487
Do you think Salak is dead?

44:11.687 --> 44:14.187
I think so. By now he must be.

44:14.387 --> 44:16.387
My family is too.

44:19.788 --> 44:21.688
Makes me feel sad.

44:23.388 --> 44:27.088
- <i>You miss 'em?</i>
- <i>Mm-hmm. I miss 'em a lot.</i>

44:27.288 --> 44:29.189
They're not gone, you know?

44:30.689 --> 44:32.589
They're right here in your heart.

44:33.989 --> 44:36.289
Did you know that?

44:36.489 --> 44:39.290
- Can you remember the last thing
your father said to you?
- Mm-hmm.

44:39.490 --> 44:41.990
- What?
- "I'll always be with you. "

44:42.190 --> 44:45.390
<i>See what I mean?</i>
<i>And if you remember that...</i>

44:45.690 --> 44:48.991
And if you remember
all the things he said to you...

44:50.691 --> 44:52.891
and if you remember
how much he loved you...

44:54.191 --> 44:55.991
then he'll never be gone.

45:02.992 --> 45:06.593
- But it hurts.
- So you think about the happy things.

45:06.793 --> 45:09.393
<i>Now, tell me about your mother.</i>

45:09.693 --> 45:12.493
What do you remember about her
that makes you happy?

45:12.693 --> 45:15.194
She used to sing me a song.

45:15.394 --> 45:18.594
- Do you remember the song?
- Mm-hmm.

45:18.794 --> 45:21.394
- Well, sing it to me.
- Sing!

45:21.594 --> 45:25.295
# My star keeps me company #

45:25.595 --> 45:28.895
# And leads me through the night #

45:29.095 --> 45:32.595
# My star watches over me #

45:32.895 --> 45:36.396
# And fills my dreams with light #

45:36.696 --> 45:38.896
# Some things change #

45:39.096 --> 45:44.697
# But some things shine
forever as they are #

45:44.997 --> 45:48.797
# In the sky shining high #

45:49.097 --> 45:51.297
# My star ##

45:51.497 --> 45:53.798
Oh, my, what a song. That's beautiful.

45:56.198 --> 45:57.998
Mmmmm.

46:25.101 --> 46:28.501
<i>Cindel!</i>

46:34.602 --> 46:38.303
<i>Cindel!</i>

47:22.007 --> 47:26.608
<i>Cindel!</i>

47:26.908 --> 47:28.808
Mommy?

47:34.909 --> 47:36.709
Huh?

47:38.009 --> 47:39.909
Cindel?

47:43.310 --> 47:45.210
Cindel?

47:47.510 --> 47:49.410
Cindel!

47:51.110 --> 47:53.411
Cindel!

47:57.011 --> 47:59.511
Cindel gone! Noa! Noa!

47:59.711 --> 48:02.412
Wake! Wake, Noa! Help!

48:02.612 --> 48:06.212
- Noa! Wake!

48:07.812 --> 48:09.912
Water crash.

48:12.213 --> 48:14.113
Aaah! What's going on here?

48:14.313 --> 48:16.313
- <i>What's the matter? What is it?</i>
- <i>Cindel gone.</i>

48:16.513 --> 48:19.413
- What are you talking about,
you little beggar?
- Noa! Help! Cindel gone.

48:19.613 --> 48:21.514
Cindel gone!

48:35.815 --> 48:38.115
Danger, Noa. Danger.

48:39.216 --> 48:42.716
<i>Cindel!</i>

48:43.016 --> 48:44.916
Over there. Come on!

49:02.418 --> 49:06.419
<i>#My star keeps me company #</i>

49:06.619 --> 49:09.619
<i># And leads me through the night #</i>

49:10.819 --> 49:13.919
<i># My star watches over me #</i>

49:14.119 --> 49:18.020
<i># And fills my dreams with light #</i>

49:18.320 --> 49:20.220
- <i># Some things change #
- Come on.</i>

49:20.420 --> 49:25.521
- Up you go. W we’ll find her.
- <i># And some things shine</i>
<i>forever as they are #</i>

49:25.821 --> 49:30.021
<i># In the sky shining high #</i>

49:30.321 --> 49:33.121
<i># My star ##</i>

49:46.823 --> 49:49.723
Hello. I've been waiting for you.

49:49.923 --> 49:51.923
That song.

49:52.123 --> 49:53.824
Do you like that song?

49:54.024 --> 49:56.824
I've always liked it.
How did you know it?

49:57.024 --> 49:59.024
I know many things.

50:02.125 --> 50:03.925
Well, I can't hear it any more.

50:04.125 --> 50:06.525
- I don't know which way to go.

50:09.225 --> 50:11.026
This way. This way.

50:13.126 --> 50:15.226
Come to me, my little one.

50:21.327 --> 50:23.827
Will you hand me my robe?

50:38.629 --> 50:41.429
I told you there was no escape.

50:44.829 --> 50:48.330
<i>Help! Help!</i>

51:08.432 --> 51:10.332
You go upstairs now and get my rope.

51:27.634 --> 51:29.434
Got it.

51:43.836 --> 51:45.736
Hurry!

52:53.843 --> 52:56.943
So, my little princess...

52:57.143 --> 53:02.344
has come to help Terak
learn the ways of the power.

53:02.744 --> 53:04.644
What have you done with the Ewoks?

53:04.744 --> 53:08.245
- Ewoks?
- My friends, where are they?

53:08.545 --> 53:13.145
Ahhh. The Ewoks. Of course.
Your friends.

53:13.445 --> 53:15.946
They are my friends too.

53:16.146 --> 53:18.346
They are here at my castle...

53:18.546 --> 53:20.846
as my... my guests...

53:21.046 --> 53:23.346
my most honoured guests.

53:26.647 --> 53:28.747
You better not have hurt them.

53:28.947 --> 53:32.447
Ohhh. I won't hurt them.

53:32.747 --> 53:34.548
Not if...

53:34.748 --> 53:38.348
<i>you make this work.</i>

53:38.548 --> 53:40.848
What do you mean?

53:41.048 --> 53:42.948
Use your magic.

53:43.148 --> 53:45.649
I don't know anything about magic.

53:45.849 --> 53:49.149
All I want is the power.

53:49.449 --> 53:51.849
Make it work!

53:52.049 --> 53:53.850
I can't!

53:54.050 --> 53:56.450
Don't be foolish. Do what he says.

53:56.650 --> 53:58.450
I can't! I can't!

53:58.550 --> 54:01.850
I will give you until dawn.

54:02.151 --> 54:05.451
If you have not done
as I have commanded...

54:05.651 --> 54:10.851
you and your friends will be doomed.

54:11.151 --> 54:15.852
<i>And you will follow her in her fate.</i>

54:16.152 --> 54:18.052
You are my lord.

54:19.252 --> 54:23.653
No. No tricks.

54:23.953 --> 54:26.153
Take them away!

54:26.353 --> 54:30.054
Let go of me!
Put me down!

54:46.155 --> 54:49.456
- Slow down, Teek.
- Teek!

54:51.556 --> 54:53.456
Ouch!

55:00.557 --> 55:02.657
Teek, now I told you to slow down.

55:04.057 --> 55:07.558
<i>We're getting close now.</i>
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

55:24.459 --> 55:26.660
Mm? Look!

55:30.660 --> 55:34.861
Couldn't you wave your hands over it
or something?

55:35.161 --> 55:36.961
Or is it a special word?

55:37.161 --> 55:39.161
I don't know what you're talking about.

55:39.361 --> 55:42.861
The power.
You must know how to unlock the power.

55:43.061 --> 55:44.862
This isn't good for anything.

55:45.062 --> 55:46.862
You just have to plug it into something.

55:47.062 --> 55:48.762
You're lying. He told us about this.

55:48.862 --> 55:50.962
<i>He told us it was the key to all his power.</i>

55:51.162 --> 55:55.263
Power greater than mine,
greater than Terak's.

55:55.563 --> 55:57.863
But it's just a piece of the star cruiser.

55:58.063 --> 56:02.764
That's right. The power of the stars.

56:03.064 --> 56:05.364
That's what Salak
was searching for long ago.

56:05.564 --> 56:09.364
Salak? Noa's friend?

56:09.664 --> 56:11.665
Yes, Salak.

56:14.265 --> 56:16.165
<i>Salak.</i>

56:19.065 --> 56:22.266
<i>Terak killed Salak for the power then.</i>

56:22.466 --> 56:24.866
He'll kill you and me for it now.

56:25.066 --> 56:28.866
<i>You're crazy.</i>
<i>Salak just wanted</i>
<i>to get away from here...</i>

56:29.166 --> 56:31.367
Just like me and my family.

56:31.567 --> 56:33.367
We just wanted to go home.

56:36.367 --> 56:38.267
It's another ship.

56:48.068 --> 56:50.269
Noa, look.

56:52.469 --> 56:55.569
Oh, my goodness.
Will you look at that moat now?

56:55.869 --> 56:57.869
Water black as ink.

56:59.370 --> 57:01.670
Wicket swim.

57:01.870 --> 57:05.270
Oh, no, you don't swim.
Here. Take a look at this.

57:08.271 --> 57:10.171
Oh! Ohhh!

57:11.771 --> 57:14.771
You see that?
That could've been you, you little beggar.

57:31.073 --> 57:33.973
Ah. Okay, Teek, grab a hold.

57:38.974 --> 57:42.274
Now, off you go.

58:08.477 --> 58:10.277
All right. Your turn.

58:11.777 --> 58:14.978
Ready?
Back up and get a runnin' start.

58:17.478 --> 58:19.578
- Ready.
- Go!

58:19.778 --> 58:23.179
Ohhh!

58:23.379 --> 58:24.879
<i>Get your feet out of the water!</i>

58:25.079 --> 58:28.179
Noa, pull! Help wicket! Help!

58:28.479 --> 58:31.780
Pull! Pull! Pull! Whoa!

58:31.980 --> 58:34.280
Whoa-ho!

58:34.480 --> 58:36.780
Oh! Ow!

58:49.182 --> 58:51.782
Okay.

59:01.083 --> 59:02.183
Hurry, Teek.

59:04.283 --> 59:06.483
Come on! Come on!

59:28.286 --> 59:30.686
- Aaah!
- Whoa!

59:50.588 --> 59:52.988
- Hey! Hey!

01:00:42.494 --> 01:00:44.794
Cindel, Ewoks through door.

01:00:44.994 --> 01:00:47.694
- What door?
- <i>That door. Cross room.</i>

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:52.295
- Now how are we
supposed to get over there?

01:01:15.997 --> 01:01:18.098
What do you got there?

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.900
<i>Get your foot outta my eye.</i>

01:02:10.803 --> 01:02:15.004
This way!

01:02:17.204 --> 01:02:19.504
Hang on, Teek. Stay close.

01:02:46.807 --> 01:02:52.008
- All right now, Teek.
You gotta get them keys.

01:02:52.308 --> 01:02:56.208
Be careful. Now go on.

01:03:20.711 --> 01:03:23.911
- Teek!

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:39.913
Ahhh.

01:04:17.317 --> 01:04:19.317
Huh?

01:04:30.418 --> 01:04:32.619
Huh?

01:04:35.819 --> 01:04:39.019
- Wicket! Noa!

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.521
No worries. I'll get us out of here.

01:05:02.522 --> 01:05:06.022
Hey. Hey, you!

01:05:06.322 --> 01:05:08.323
Let me out.

01:05:15.523 --> 01:05:18.624
No. Not her. She's evil!

01:05:26.624 --> 01:05:28.625
Follow wicket. We escape.

01:05:28.825 --> 01:05:31.925
- Must go. Hurry.

01:05:34.425 --> 01:05:37.326
- Shh!

01:05:42.526 --> 01:05:44.426
<i>Be careful.</i>

01:05:46.127 --> 01:05:48.427
Hey!

01:05:57.528 --> 01:06:01.128
This way. This way. Hurry.

01:06:01.328 --> 01:06:05.229
- Deej! Deej! Quick.

01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:23.731
- Huh?

01:06:51.134 --> 01:06:55.334
What are we gonna do, Noa?
There's no way out.

01:06:55.634 --> 01:06:59.535
No door, huh?
Well, I'll make us a door.

01:07:02.835 --> 01:07:06.435
Now get back, everybody.
Quick. Duck down.

01:07:15.236 --> 01:07:18.237
By golly, it's morning already.

01:07:34.238 --> 01:07:36.339
Get out of the way.

01:07:39.439 --> 01:07:41.639
What do you know?
I caught it on the first try.

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.741
All right, now. Hang on tight.

01:07:57.141 --> 01:07:59.341
Whoa!

01:07:59.541 --> 01:08:01.841
Whoa! Oh!

01:08:17.743 --> 01:08:19.743
- Ow!

01:08:26.944 --> 01:08:30.444
Okay. You're next. You too.

01:08:34.245 --> 01:08:36.245
<i>I'm sorry about your friend Salak.</i>

01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:39.845
- Salak?
- They killed him for the power thing.

01:08:40.045 --> 01:08:41.946
<i>What power thing?</i>

01:08:44.845 --> 01:08:48.546
No! No! It's mine.

01:08:48.845 --> 01:08:50.947
- Let's get outta here.

01:09:02.747 --> 01:09:06.747
Hold on. Here we go!

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:15.149
Oh!

01:09:43.452 --> 01:09:45.853
Run, you little bug-lovers. Run!

01:10:25.457 --> 01:10:29.557
No. No, Terak. I can help you.

01:10:29.857 --> 01:10:33.358
There's another ship.
I can find it.

01:10:33.558 --> 01:10:35.258
- <i>Ha, ha!</i>

01:10:35.458 --> 01:10:37.858
- No! No!

01:11:17.562 --> 01:11:19.763
- Let's go now.

01:13:46.779 --> 01:13:49.079
Come on. Keep up.

01:14:07.681 --> 01:14:11.181
- Come on. Hurry along.

01:14:58.486 --> 01:15:02.787
Okay. Now all you gotta do is hold 'em off
till I get the power going.

01:15:02.987 --> 01:15:06.687
<i>Understand me? If you can buy me</i>
<i>some time, we just might have a chance.</i>

01:15:06.987 --> 01:15:10.688
Cindel, you and a couple of your friends,
come with me, okay?

01:15:10.988 --> 01:15:11.988
Mm-hmm.

01:15:12.088 --> 01:15:14.788
- And, wicket,
you're in charge of the others.
- Yes! We fight!

01:15:18.188 --> 01:15:21.889
I got a catapult in the trees.
So, now, go to it!

01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:33.490
- Cross your fingers now.

01:15:39.191 --> 01:15:42.691
Okay now.
Let's power up this old tin can.

01:15:46.592 --> 01:15:48.392
Aw, come on.

01:15:48.592 --> 01:15:52.092
- What if it doesn't work?
- Then we're really in trouble.

01:16:48.998 --> 01:16:51.499
Come on.
Light up, you worn-out tin can.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.701
Power modulator, generator,
oscillator on. Huh.

01:18:01.606 --> 01:18:05.106
- Okay, Cindel. Turn on the red one.

01:18:06.607 --> 01:18:09.007
<i>No! No, the other one.</i>

01:18:39.210 --> 01:18:41.110
Huh? Oh!

01:19:19.815 --> 01:19:22.115
Noa, here they come!

01:19:35.916 --> 01:19:38.617
- Uh!

01:21:21.428 --> 01:21:24.328
Look out. They're here.

01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:30.229
- Noa!

01:21:32.029 --> 01:21:34.529
Come on. Come on!

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:48.531
Oh, no.
They're coming on the other side.

01:21:49.731 --> 01:21:51.631
All right. Now!

01:21:57.332 --> 01:21:59.932
You two, take the other one.

01:22:26.335 --> 01:22:27.935
Aha!

01:22:29.635 --> 01:22:32.335
You'll not come around botherin' me!

01:23:35.442 --> 01:23:37.642
Take that, you big tall lummox.

01:23:52.244 --> 01:23:54.944
- Wicket!

01:24:04.445 --> 01:24:07.846
Oh! Aaah!

01:24:08.146 --> 01:24:10.246
Wicket!

01:24:15.347 --> 01:24:17.747
- Whoa!
- Wicket!

01:24:22.947 --> 01:24:26.048
- Oh!

01:24:26.248 --> 01:24:27.848
Huh?

01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:53.151
Aieee!

01:24:53.351 --> 01:24:55.151
No!

01:24:57.151 --> 01:24:59.451
<i>Cindel! Please help!</i>

01:25:04.852 --> 01:25:07.652
- <i>Wicket, are you hurt?</i>

01:25:07.852 --> 01:25:10.953
- Not hurt.
- <i>They're all running away.</i>

01:25:11.253 --> 01:25:14.353
Everything's okay now.

01:25:14.553 --> 01:25:17.353
You, Ewok! Get Noa!

01:25:18.753 --> 01:25:21.954
Tell the old man he has a choice.

01:25:22.154 --> 01:25:25.554
He gives me the power or we will take her.

01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:27.654
Go! Tell him now!

01:25:43.256 --> 01:25:46.456
<i>Old man, I have your child...</i>

01:25:46.656 --> 01:25:49.757
And you have something of mine.

01:25:53.957 --> 01:25:57.458
- I am waiting, old man.
- You let her go!

01:25:57.758 --> 01:26:02.558
Give me the power and I won't harm her.

01:26:02.858 --> 01:26:06.359
Defy me and she is doomed.

01:26:11.459 --> 01:26:13.459
All right, then.

01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:17.360
If she dies, you get nothing.

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.560
You turn her loose and I'll fight you for it.

01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:25.361
Go!

01:26:25.561 --> 01:26:28.561
- Get her out of here, would ya?
- Hurry, Cindel.

01:27:27.267 --> 01:27:30.968
Aaah! Ow!

01:27:47.869 --> 01:27:50.070
Do something, wicket. Do something!

01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:08.072
- Noa! Noa!

01:28:43.075 --> 01:28:46.776
- Say, now. You come back from there.

01:28:47.076 --> 01:28:49.776
- Noa.
- Will you look at that?

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:26.080
You, sir.

01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:31.281
I'm proud to know ya,
and my life is better for it.

01:29:31.481 --> 01:29:34.681
- Noa.
- Brave and fine little warrior.

01:29:34.881 --> 01:29:36.781
Oh.

01:29:38.081 --> 01:29:41.482
- Bye.
- And all the rest of ya too.

01:29:41.682 --> 01:29:43.582
Bye, Noa.

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:51.683
- <i>And now you.</i>

01:29:57.083 --> 01:30:00.284
What do I say to you, my friend?

01:30:05.284 --> 01:30:07.185
You're a sweet spirit.

01:30:07.385 --> 01:30:09.885
I love ya and I'm gonna miss ya.

01:30:24.686 --> 01:30:27.587
Oh, wicket. You're my very best friend.

01:30:27.787 --> 01:30:32.887
- Best friend. Best friend.
- I'm gonna miss you.

01:30:33.187 --> 01:30:36.388
I'll come back and visit you as soon as I can.

01:30:36.588 --> 01:30:41.588
- Please come back.
- I'll come back and visit you both.

01:30:45.489 --> 01:30:50.789
- Goodbye. Goodbye.
- "Goodbye" not good.

01:30:58.890 --> 01:31:01.290
<i>Come on, Cindel. It's time we go.</i>

01:31:08.491 --> 01:31:13.292
- Off you go. So long. Bye, Teek.

01:32:16.098 --> 01:32:18.299
<i>Teeha, </i> Cindel. Bye. Bye.

01:32:18.499 --> 01:32:23.299
<i>Teeha, </i> Cindel. <i>Teeha, </i> Cindel.
Bye. <i>Teeha, </i> Cindel.

01:32:23.599 --> 01:32:26.800
<i>Teeha. Teeha, </i> Cindel.
