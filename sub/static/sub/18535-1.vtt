AHHHHHH!

34:12.183 --> 34:13.575
SNOOP!
It's me! it's me!

34:13.599 --> 34:15.327
Calm down.

34:15.351 --> 34:16.495
Wha-You scared
the shit outta me!

34:16.519 --> 34:18.456
-What are you
doing here?
I-It's not as
weird as it looks.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.999
Your door was unlocked.

34:21.023 --> 34:22.584
NOPE!
Waiting in someones
car is pretty creepy.

34:22.608 --> 34:24.818
Ok, sorry.

34:25.111 --> 34:26.529
Hoooo god.
[deep breath]

34:30.824 --> 34:32.261
[pfoooooo]

34:32.285 --> 34:33.369
[sigh]

34:35.330 --> 34:37.849
So you're really doing it huh?

34:37.873 --> 34:40.376
I'm sorry Dash,

34:41.252 --> 34:44.190
this must be hard on you. It's all
happening so fast,

34:44.214 --> 34:45.441
I know, it's crazy.
[defeated sigh]

34:45.465 --> 34:49.236
I've never understood
long engagements,

34:49.260 --> 34:50.987
and I can get my
green card faster

34:51.011 --> 34:53.115
once we're married.

34:53.139 --> 34:55.225
Green card?

34:55.891 --> 34:57.453
Ohh...

34:57.477 --> 34:59.538
We're talking about
moving to New York.

34:59.562 --> 35:01.897
Wow, New York.
Big apple.
[chortle]

35:02.106 --> 35:05.609
I would totally
understand if
you didn't come.

35:07.027 --> 35:08.671
No-no, I want to come.

35:08.695 --> 35:10.281
Well, it would mean a lot to me.

35:11.990 --> 35:16.012
[rustling]

35:16.036 --> 35:17.096
Don't uh!

35:17.120 --> 35:18.831
I was really angry.

35:20.123 --> 35:22.835
That's ok, I'd
feel the same way.

35:24.628 --> 35:26.922
I've known you since
you were twelve years old.

35:29.342 --> 35:31.553
I have to be at your wedding.

35:33.053 --> 35:34.054
I'll bring a date.

35:39.602 --> 35:43.832
I have to go home,

35:43.856 --> 35:49.171
I uh. [hem] Far too much drama for
a Tuesday night; do you want a ride?

35:49.195 --> 35:50.339
Yeah, thanks-No!

35:50.363 --> 35:51.590
I have my bike.

35:51.614 --> 35:54.634
[giggling]

35:54.658 --> 35:58.430
Find a date.

35:58.454 --> 35:59.889
[tsk]

35:59.913 --> 36:00.914
I'll see ya later.

36:02.124 --> 36:03.768

Hey.

37:25.583 --> 37:26.561
[clank]

37:26.585 --> 37:27.866
Nice to see you,
how've you been?

37:30.212 --> 37:33.716
I've been better.

37:34.342 --> 37:36.320
We have all been better.

37:36.344 --> 37:38.988
Do you play?

37:39.012 --> 37:40.740
[chuckle] Not well.

37:40.764 --> 37:43.159
[chuckling]
Yeah, be either.

37:43.183 --> 37:45.203
[ball dribbles]

37:45.227 --> 37:46.580
Ow! Awww.

37:46.604 --> 37:48.666
Ok, I don't feel
threatened, I'll play.

37:48.690 --> 37:51.191
[ba-dum]

37:52.234 --> 37:53.516
I'm really worried about Lauren.

37:54.362 --> 37:56.130
I think maybe I should call her.

37:56.154 --> 37:57.716
[pang]

37:57.740 --> 37:58.941
Right...You don't give advice.

38:01.536 --> 38:03.912
If you
want to call her. Call
her. You got her number.

38:04.455 --> 38:08.000
Sorry, w-what is that? Is
that reverse psychology?

38:09.419 --> 38:13.607
Nope, it's about taking action.

38:13.631 --> 38:16.067
Hey, I don't
want to be like this.

38:16.091 --> 38:17.777
How about some truth Dash?

38:17.801 --> 38:19.530
What really happened
between you and Lauren?

38:19.554 --> 38:22.264
I mean, [forced chuckle]

38:22.889 --> 38:26.495
I... I dunno,

38:26.519 --> 38:28.204
I wasn't ready...
To settle down,

38:28.228 --> 38:30.648
get married, have
kids... All that shit.

38:31.482 --> 38:35.629
I... I was 32,

38:35.653 --> 38:38.549
and thought I needed some space,

38:38.573 --> 38:40.049
I fucked up.

38:40.073 --> 38:41.968
But I mean now,

38:41.992 --> 38:44.220
I'd try marriage, why not?

38:44.244 --> 38:46.014
I mean Lauren and
I were together for
ten years right? So.

38:46.038 --> 38:48.999
She's barely known Mark
Adam Jones for one year.

38:49.291 --> 38:53.271
I...

38:53.295 --> 38:54.897
What the hell am
I supposed to do.

38:54.921 --> 38:56.716
WHY WON'T YOU
GIVE ME ANY ADVICE!?

do in here all day man? I'm starting to
worry about you.

39:40.258 --> 39:41.319
I'm fine.

39:41.343 --> 39:42.428
[plop]

39:43.763 --> 39:45.323
Well you don't look fine.

39:45.347 --> 39:46.890

39:48.934 --> 39:51.269
[pop]

39:51.978 --> 39:53.998
have you been
touching yourself again?[rustle]

39:54.022 --> 39:56.585
Yeah, that's definitely
cum I'm smelling.

39:56.609 --> 39:58.670
Alright, I get it.

39:58.694 --> 40:00.046
I need to clean.

40:00.070 --> 40:01.214
I know that.

40:01.238 --> 40:04.676
You're not going
to be able to have kids
if you pump it too much. Once a week with
an icy cool cream.

40:04.700 --> 40:06.910
[eesk]

40:07.620 --> 40:09.972
It's all about
the big release. There's something
wrong with you.

40:09.996 --> 40:12.601
Definitely.

40:12.625 --> 40:14.352
[snort]

40:14.376 --> 40:15.604
So how is therapy going?

40:15.628 --> 40:18.231
Terrible,

40:18.255 --> 40:19.775
I think my expectations
were too high.

40:19.799 --> 40:21.424
I don't know

40:22.510 --> 40:24.028
I've never found
a good therapist myself.

40:24.052 --> 40:26.740
I actually don't
think they exist.

40:26.764 --> 40:28.742
I mean think about it,

40:28.766 --> 40:31.829
if you're really
good, you wouldn't
have any patients. Hm? [pfft] Good
call man, brilliant.

40:31.853 --> 40:33.996
Exactly.

40:34.020 --> 40:35.731
Which reminds me.

40:37.315 --> 40:38.417
[rustling]

40:38.441 --> 40:39.711
[scratching]

40:39.735 --> 40:40.820
What is that?

40:43.321 --> 40:44.675
[laughs]
A form of therapy,

40:44.699 --> 40:46.552
[pffft]
I built it
with my students.

40:46.576 --> 40:48.595
Are you familiar with
the Rightman experiment?

40:48.619 --> 40:50.388
No.

40:50.412 --> 40:51.306
Good.

40:51.330 --> 40:54.893
You just slip your little
finger into that ring, and uh... attach the
wires to a live battery.

40:54.917 --> 40:58.980
To a-yeah,

40:59.004 --> 40:59.858
that sounds really safe.

40:59.882 --> 41:01.692
Hey, when you're a
fat man in a skinny world,

41:01.716 --> 41:03.401
you'll try just about anything.

41:03.425 --> 41:05.571
[chortling]
You're not fat.

41:05.595 --> 41:07.680
No, not on the outside.

41:08.305 --> 41:09.825
[chortles]

41:09.849 --> 41:11.325
So every time
you think about Lauren,

41:11.349 --> 41:12.536
you just press that
little red button,

41:12.560 --> 41:13.745
and shock yourself.

41:13.769 --> 41:15.288
Easy-peasy MMmm.

41:15.312 --> 41:19.125
You know, I think I'm
gonna stick with therapy
for the time being. But this is great,

41:19.149 --> 41:21.460
it's nice to
have a backup plan. >> Suit yourself.

41:21.484 --> 41:22.462
Appreciate that.

41:22.487 --> 41:24.882
You teach at
M.I.T. right? That's the calibre of
work I'm looking at here?

41:24.906 --> 41:27.049
That is directly
from M.I.T..

41:27.073 --> 41:29.010

41:29.034 --> 41:31.304

Sam Ryan.

42:47.905 --> 42:49.507
Well clearly you
did not learn
the first rule

42:49.531 --> 42:51.550
which is that you
cannot trust people

42:51.574 --> 42:54.012
with two first names,

42:54.036 --> 42:55.179
especially if one of those names

42:55.203 --> 42:56.514
is one of ambiguous
unisex names like "Sam".

42:56.538 --> 43:00.476
[dramatic] I wish
I would have known this
[dramatic]
You're a fool!

43:00.500 --> 43:02.688
[dramatic] Sam got me
into so much trouble.

43:02.712 --> 43:04.563
Yep. [coughing]More-like-you-got-her

43:04.587 --> 43:07.859
It was an all

43:07.883 --> 43:09.360
there wasn't
anything else to do.

More like peach schnapps
and a hairspray bottle. [sneezes] [cough]
Excuse me. [sniff]

43:15.850 --> 43:18.452
Wow, you are so good looking.

43:18.476 --> 43:21.563
Instead of
"bless you"? No?

43:22.522 --> 43:24.668
Not a Seinfeld fan?

43:24.692 --> 43:26.670
