WEBVTT

00:01.540 --> 00:03.479
WINTERS: Remains were
found six hours ago.

00:03.513 --> 00:04.275
By the time I got here,

00:04.300 --> 00:05.705
they were already processing the scene.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.133
We're a long way from Houston, Liz.

00:07.168 --> 00:08.702
What's your interest in this?

00:08.736 --> 00:11.471
I think the victim's related
to some cases I've been working.

00:11.506 --> 00:13.974
Murdered in Texas, buried here,
which makes it your play.

00:14.008 --> 00:17.277
Parish PD's a little cranky about it.

00:17.311 --> 00:20.213
Special Agent Suggs, FBI. How are you?

00:20.248 --> 00:21.615
Good.

00:21.649 --> 00:23.884
Now here's what we're looking at.

00:23.918 --> 00:26.820
It's a single GSW, through and through.

00:26.854 --> 00:29.656
The size of that skull,
I'm thinking adolescent male,

00:29.690 --> 00:31.591
maybe 12 to 14 years old.

00:31.626 --> 00:33.026
No, we don't know the gender.

00:33.060 --> 00:35.529
Actually, we do. The bones were
found wrapped in that blanket.

00:37.331 --> 00:38.465
Look at that tag.

00:38.499 --> 00:40.267
"Quitman YDF."

00:40.334 --> 00:42.702
It's an all-male
juvie facility in Texas.

00:42.737 --> 00:45.305
Guys who found him think we're
looking at a friend of theirs

00:45.339 --> 00:46.706
who disappeared in 1988.

00:46.741 --> 00:48.441
They were all inmates together.

00:48.476 --> 00:51.811
Guys? What-what guys?

00:51.846 --> 00:53.847
Friends of yours?

00:55.216 --> 00:57.217
It's complicated.

00:58.452 --> 01:00.541
All right, let's go talk to 'em.

01:02.290 --> 01:04.807
(rock music playing)

01:04.840 --> 01:06.192
SHAWN: <i>Unbelievable, man.</i>

01:06.227 --> 01:08.562
You see how the FBI dude's eyes
lit up when you showed him

01:08.596 --> 01:10.263
those land records?
Like he won the damn lottery.

01:10.331 --> 01:11.798
Yeah. No, this could work, guys.

01:11.832 --> 01:13.466
Feds don't care who Ray Carroll is,

01:13.501 --> 01:15.735
and those land records are
gonna be hard to explain away.

01:15.770 --> 01:18.638
Plus, we got Liz on our case,
so, I think we finally got him.

01:18.673 --> 01:20.006
What should I do?

01:20.041 --> 01:21.039
What do you mean?

01:21.064 --> 01:22.542
Carroll's still got
that endorsement event

01:22.577 --> 01:23.777
tonight out at the ranch.

01:23.811 --> 01:25.879
Maybe y'all need to move it
to some place

01:25.913 --> 01:27.147
like the federal penitentiary.

01:27.181 --> 01:28.582
I'm serious. I'm supposed to meet CeCe

01:28.616 --> 01:30.016
at the house in, like, an hour.

01:30.051 --> 01:31.818
- So, I feel like I should go.
- No, she's right.

01:31.852 --> 01:33.186
Who knows how long it's gonna take

01:33.220 --> 01:34.721
for the cops to get there, you know?

01:34.755 --> 01:36.890
She doesn't show up,
the warden might get suspicious.

01:36.924 --> 01:39.693
Well, what if they show up,
and she's there?

01:39.727 --> 01:41.194
GIL: She'll take a damn video!

01:41.228 --> 01:43.897
Think Carroll's having a picnic
on the train tracks, man.

01:43.931 --> 01:46.266
Mm-hmm. GIL: That's it. This
time, the warden's going down.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.701
- (laughter)
- Yeah!

01:47.735 --> 01:49.669
- JACKSON: <i>Come on!
- ♪ I need a love  ♪</i>

01:49.704 --> 01:52.038
- ♪ To keep me happy... ♪
<i>-Warden's going down!</i>

01:52.073 --> 01:53.673
Hey.

01:53.708 --> 01:54.874
Where have you been?

01:54.909 --> 01:57.310
Figuring out my life. (knocking)

01:57.345 --> 01:58.812
Uh, I'm gonna have to call you back.

01:58.846 --> 02:00.645
I can't do this anymore.

02:02.808 --> 02:04.014
I love you.

02:04.452 --> 02:06.252
I love you more than anything
else in my entire life,

02:06.287 --> 02:08.679
and I'm-I'm not gonna
let this happen to us.

02:09.479 --> 02:10.580
Baby, I...

02:12.253 --> 02:13.675
I am so sorry.

02:13.961 --> 02:16.508
I never meant to hurt you. I...

02:16.998 --> 02:18.172
What happened to you?

02:18.833 --> 02:19.893
It's over.

02:22.564 --> 02:25.605
The police are questioning the warden,

02:25.640 --> 02:28.141
and I think he's gonna go down
for the murder

02:28.468 --> 02:31.147
of a kid who disappeared
while we were at Quitman.

02:34.682 --> 02:36.348
I want you back, baby.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.452
I want you to come home.

02:39.487 --> 02:41.521
Tell me you'll take me back, please.

02:43.324 --> 02:45.012
(sniffles)

02:52.875 --> 02:54.534
I have missed you so much.

02:54.568 --> 02:56.603
I... I love you.

02:56.637 --> 02:57.995
I love you, too.

02:58.673 --> 03:00.640
(sighs)

03:00.675 --> 03:01.908
(sniffles)

03:01.942 --> 03:03.531
You want to hear something crazy?

03:04.279 --> 03:05.512
What?

03:05.806 --> 03:06.957
I'm pregnant.

03:07.648 --> 03:09.649
(laughs)

03:10.651 --> 03:12.157
Are you serious?

03:13.371 --> 03:15.355
(laughing): We're gonna...?

03:15.389 --> 03:17.357
We're gonna have a baby?

03:17.391 --> 03:18.858
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be doing

03:18.893 --> 03:20.126
most of the work, but, yeah.

03:20.161 --> 03:22.328
- (laughter)
- Can you believe that?

03:26.600 --> 03:27.973
(sniffles)

03:29.937 --> 03:32.038
TUTTLE: All right, the
governor arrives at 6:00.

03:32.073 --> 03:34.307
We'll do the meet-and-greet
before, ops on the porch.

03:34.341 --> 03:36.042
Where is Jessie?

03:36.077 --> 03:37.711
This is so unlike her to be late.

03:37.745 --> 03:39.345
At 6:30, working the room,

03:39.380 --> 03:42.246
then the program will start
at 7:00 sharp, all right?

03:44.009 --> 03:45.185
Ray?

03:46.447 --> 03:48.488
Yeah. Uh, that's good.

03:48.522 --> 03:49.985
Just give me a minute.

03:56.313 --> 03:57.564
Ray Carroll?

03:57.598 --> 03:59.833
- Yes.
- Special Agent Suggs. FBI.

03:59.867 --> 04:01.534
We need to talk.

04:04.772 --> 04:09.997
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

04:10.524 --> 04:12.609
When's the last time
you saw this boy alive?

04:12.643 --> 04:13.958
Like I told you before,

04:13.983 --> 04:15.513
it was right after the accident.

04:15.862 --> 04:17.596
They brought him in to the infirmary.

04:17.630 --> 04:19.445
I had one of the guards
put him in a van,

04:19.470 --> 04:20.617
take him to the emergency room.

04:21.277 --> 04:22.730
Know what happened after the van left?

04:23.112 --> 04:25.347
Well, I always assumed they
took him to the hospital.

04:25.715 --> 04:27.316
But when he never came back,

04:27.350 --> 04:29.451
I asked the day nurse about it, and

04:29.486 --> 04:31.920
she said they transferred him
to another facility

04:31.955 --> 04:33.255
for medical reasons.

04:33.289 --> 04:34.924
Did you sign off on the paperwork?

04:35.291 --> 04:36.959
Oh, I'm sure I did.

04:36.993 --> 04:38.393
We lost all those records in the riot,

04:38.428 --> 04:39.749
but that would have been
standard procedure.

04:39.784 --> 04:41.056
Do you recall purchasing

04:41.090 --> 04:44.333
land on the Louisiana border
in August of 1988?

04:45.099 --> 04:46.635
Yeah, I remember this.

04:46.669 --> 04:48.345
Supposed to be good bird hunting.

04:49.138 --> 04:50.255
What about it?

04:51.174 --> 04:53.175
Well, that's where we found
the remains this morning,

04:53.209 --> 04:55.944
on land that you purchased three
days after this boy disappeared.

04:55.979 --> 04:57.648
You have any explanations for that?

04:59.816 --> 05:00.847
Hmm.

05:01.851 --> 05:03.119
Well...

05:08.952 --> 05:10.325
Red and Bobby.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.394
Excuse me?

05:12.428 --> 05:14.584
There were two guards
that worked for me at Quitman.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.667
I took them there hunting
a couple times.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.668
They knew where this land was.

05:19.702 --> 05:21.440
They must have buried him there.

05:21.474 --> 05:23.006
Why would they want to kill this boy?

05:23.041 --> 05:24.740
I don't know.

05:24.774 --> 05:26.074
They were always a problem...

05:26.109 --> 05:28.477
fighting with the inmates,
running deals on the side.

05:28.511 --> 05:30.412
They were in charge of the work detail

05:30.446 --> 05:31.600
when the accident happened.

05:31.635 --> 05:34.116
Maybe they just got scared and panicked,

05:34.150 --> 05:35.562
this was their solution.

05:36.152 --> 05:38.220
You are aware
that Bobby Marks is deceased,

05:38.254 --> 05:40.393
Red Tyson disappeared 15 years ago?

05:40.757 --> 05:41.681
I'm aware.

05:42.325 --> 05:43.865
That seems very convenient.

05:44.027 --> 05:46.505
You blaming two men who can't
tell their side of the story.

05:48.569 --> 05:50.465
Mr. Suggs, I don't like
what you're implying,

05:50.500 --> 05:52.009
so let me be clear.

05:52.669 --> 05:55.497
I'm not involved in this,
and you can't prove that I am.

05:56.105 --> 05:58.941
Now I've been very patient,
and enough is enough.

05:59.916 --> 06:01.043
Now I need to get about my day,

06:01.077 --> 06:04.346
and you two need to get the hell
off of my property

06:04.380 --> 06:06.242
and quit accusing me
of something I didn't do.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.110
Hi.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.779
Uh, there she is.

06:25.814 --> 06:27.427
RAY: Guys, give us some time.

06:30.073 --> 06:31.573
What was that all about?

06:31.608 --> 06:34.376
Well, they're investigating
some guy from Brownsville

06:34.410 --> 06:37.379
for rigging state contracts,
and they wanted background.

06:37.413 --> 06:39.047
Like I have time for that now.

06:39.082 --> 06:40.415
Why is the FBI involved?

06:40.450 --> 06:41.896
'Cause they just are, CeCe.

06:42.685 --> 06:44.086
Not for you to worry about,

06:44.120 --> 06:45.175
so drop it.

06:48.958 --> 06:50.792
How are you doing, Jessie?

06:51.849 --> 06:53.095
Hi.

06:54.530 --> 06:56.498
Oh, where-where you going, Ray?

06:56.532 --> 06:58.700
Ah. I'm gonna drive
myself out to the ranch,

06:58.735 --> 07:01.470
use the windshield time
to work on my speech.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.060
I'll see you there later.

07:04.507 --> 07:05.900
I thought you were driving him.

07:06.367 --> 07:08.315
- I thought I was, too.
- (door closes)

07:10.037 --> 07:11.009
Oh, my God. Um...

07:11.717 --> 07:12.836
CECE: What's wrong?

07:13.563 --> 07:14.950
My mom just texted me.

07:14.984 --> 07:17.586
A pipe broke, and there
is water everywhere.

07:17.620 --> 07:19.338
I'm gonna have to go home
and deal with this.

07:19.372 --> 07:20.702
You want me to have someone drive you?

07:20.727 --> 07:22.090
No. I got it.

07:22.125 --> 07:23.925
I will just go take care of this,

07:23.960 --> 07:26.161
and then, I will head
to the ranch straight after.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.763
We need you there, Jessie.

07:27.797 --> 07:29.765
I'm just gonna go deal with this, okay?

07:33.950 --> 07:36.172
Oh, he is lying, Liz. You know that.

07:37.454 --> 07:39.517
So-so what do...
what do you want us to do?

07:40.090 --> 07:42.057
I know. Yeah.

07:42.092 --> 07:43.292
Yeah. Bye.

07:43.326 --> 07:46.529
He blamed it on Red and Bobby.

07:46.563 --> 07:48.497
So, what? They're not
gonna arrest him now?

07:48.532 --> 07:49.865
Well, they can't.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.066
It's his word against

07:51.101 --> 07:52.234
Red, Bobby and Amy.

07:52.269 --> 07:54.104
They're all dead, so they got
nothing to go on.

07:54.138 --> 07:56.472
What about the human bones
all over his property?

07:56.506 --> 07:58.374
What do you want me to say, Gil?

07:58.408 --> 08:00.664
We know he did it.
We just can't prove it.

08:01.211 --> 08:02.432
Maybe he didn't.

08:02.679 --> 08:03.812
No way, Shawn.

08:03.847 --> 08:05.447
I saw him after the FBI left.

08:05.482 --> 08:06.682
He was completely spooked.

08:06.716 --> 08:08.050
Think about it.

08:08.084 --> 08:09.649
The warden's whole play
is to leverage people.

08:10.086 --> 08:12.751
Right? Make someone else do
his dirty work for him.

08:13.523 --> 08:15.976
Who were the biggest lap dogs
the entire time at Quitman?

08:16.952 --> 08:18.327
Terry and his crew.

08:18.361 --> 08:20.062
What if he made them do it?

08:20.096 --> 08:21.049
E block.

08:21.431 --> 08:23.198
Right. I mean those guys had

08:23.233 --> 08:24.934
their heads so far up the warden's ass,

08:24.968 --> 08:26.869
they never had to do work detail, so,

08:26.903 --> 08:29.038
- maybe if they were the ones that...
- They were in the same

08:29.072 --> 08:31.206
bunkroom, that means
Red went to E block to get 'em.

08:31.241 --> 08:33.042
He took 'em to the warden.
That makes sense.

08:33.076 --> 08:34.043
GIL: So what do you want to do?

08:34.826 --> 08:36.412
Walk up to Terry, ask him

08:36.446 --> 08:38.780
- if they did it?
- No.

08:41.236 --> 08:42.885
We go and talk to his brother.

08:44.387 --> 08:47.022
I had the FBI at my house,
accusing me of murder.

08:47.057 --> 08:48.424
DIANA: Just calm down.

08:48.458 --> 08:50.559
We always knew
this was a possible problem.

08:50.594 --> 08:52.036
You know who's behind this, don't you?

08:52.876 --> 08:54.163
Jackson Brooks.

08:54.197 --> 08:55.531
Did they tell you that?

08:55.599 --> 08:57.232
They didn't have to!

08:57.267 --> 08:59.435
I've been telling you
for a month he's trouble,

08:59.469 --> 09:00.868
and you haven't done anything.

09:01.171 --> 09:03.539
They have the deed records, Diana.

09:03.573 --> 09:04.873
How long you think it's gonna take

09:04.908 --> 09:06.976
for them to figure out
I sold that land to you?

09:07.010 --> 09:08.110
It doesn't matter.

09:08.144 --> 09:09.778
There's a contingency in place for that.

09:09.813 --> 09:11.480
You don't need to worry
about it. Have a seat.

09:11.812 --> 09:12.882
I don't want to sit down.

09:12.916 --> 09:14.165
Raymond!

09:23.393 --> 09:25.728
I've worked too long, and
I've invested too much in this

09:25.762 --> 09:27.463
for you to blow it for me now.

09:30.476 --> 09:32.210
You're upset, and I understand,

09:32.736 --> 09:35.104
but upset people make mistakes,
and I don't like mistakes.

09:35.138 --> 09:38.113
- If the press gets wind of this, I...
- They won't. Just trust me.

09:39.776 --> 09:42.173
So here's what I want you to do.

09:42.612 --> 09:44.622
I want you to take a deep breath.

09:44.781 --> 09:46.949
I want you to pull yourself together,

09:46.983 --> 09:49.451
and I want you to go to your party.

09:50.150 --> 09:51.253
You're gonna shake a few hands,

09:51.287 --> 09:52.621
you're gonna make a nice speech,

09:52.656 --> 09:54.023
and then in six months,

09:54.057 --> 09:56.925
we will open your
office on Capitol Hill.

09:58.828 --> 10:00.279
I ain't no religious man.

10:01.398 --> 10:03.271
Made a lot of mistakes in my life.

10:03.867 --> 10:06.294
When you came to me
asking about forgiveness,

10:06.569 --> 10:08.937
I told you straight... I can't do that

10:08.972 --> 10:10.118
for what you did to me.

10:10.607 --> 10:12.006
But this is different, Dennis.

10:13.809 --> 10:14.619
We're talking about

10:14.653 --> 10:17.180
a 12-year-old boy shot through the head

10:17.213 --> 10:19.148
and buried in a field
like a piece of trash.

10:19.182 --> 10:20.983
I know you know that's not right.

10:21.017 --> 10:22.284
And I know it bothers you.

10:22.318 --> 10:24.219
So if you're really who you say you are,

10:24.836 --> 10:25.688
now's the time to prove it.

10:25.722 --> 10:27.056
I don't know what you want from me.

10:27.090 --> 10:28.657
We want the truth, Dennis.

10:29.321 --> 10:31.093
And we think the warden
did this, and we think

10:31.127 --> 10:32.357
you know what happened.

10:32.774 --> 10:36.031
Bobby and Nurse Amy told us
Red came to E block

10:36.066 --> 10:37.499
and got you guys that day.

10:37.534 --> 10:38.967
You talked to them?

10:39.002 --> 10:42.004
Is it true? Did Red come and get
you and take you to the warden?

10:50.397 --> 10:51.714
Darryl and Eddie weren't with us.

10:51.748 --> 10:53.215
It was just me and Terry.

10:53.249 --> 10:54.230
So you were there?

10:55.218 --> 10:56.552
What happened?

11:00.657 --> 11:02.758
Red came in.
He was looking really serious.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.582
Uh, and he came and got us,
and he put us in his car.

11:07.046 --> 11:09.331
Next thing you know,
I'm riding in some van.

11:09.365 --> 11:10.899
With the warden and Petey?

11:12.402 --> 11:14.369
Yeah.

11:18.087 --> 11:20.043
I didn't know if Petey was alive or dead

11:20.076 --> 11:21.630
by the time I got into the van.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.915
<i>We drove about 20 minutes
into Louisiana.</i>

11:26.950 --> 11:30.018
Ended up in a field somewhere
<i>in the middle of nowhere.</i>

11:31.268 --> 11:32.054
Then...

11:34.398 --> 11:35.791
That's when it happened.

11:35.825 --> 11:38.527
I've always taken real good care
of you boys, haven't I?

11:39.406 --> 11:40.730
Given you special privileges,

11:40.764 --> 11:43.866
let you do things other inmates can't?

11:43.900 --> 11:45.413
That's because you've earned it.

11:46.234 --> 11:47.190
You're smart.

11:48.149 --> 11:50.439
You know how I do things,
and I respect that.

11:51.364 --> 11:53.275
The three of us have
a very special relationship,

11:53.309 --> 11:55.244
and I'd like to keep that going.

11:55.278 --> 11:56.587
Wouldn't you?

11:58.081 --> 11:59.444
Yes, sir.

11:59.479 --> 12:02.050
We have an unfortunate situation here.

12:02.733 --> 12:04.058
This boy is not gonna make it.

12:05.029 --> 12:06.822
- (panting)
- And the humane thing to do

12:06.856 --> 12:08.991
is to put him out of his misery.

12:10.850 --> 12:14.697
So which one of you is gonna
show me his appreciation?

12:15.335 --> 12:16.899
Which one of you is gonna be a man

12:16.933 --> 12:19.301
and step up and do
what needs to be done?

12:21.004 --> 12:23.238
- Show me.
- (Petey panting)

12:36.443 --> 12:38.220
(gunshot)

12:41.009 --> 12:42.981
I know I could have been stronger.

12:43.015 --> 12:44.760
GIL: It wasn't your fault.

12:44.794 --> 12:47.996
It was the warden that did this.
Terry put a bullet

12:48.031 --> 12:50.032
in Petey's head.

12:52.335 --> 12:54.423
Cold blood, point blank.

12:55.848 --> 12:57.856
And he didn't even feel bad about it.

12:58.308 --> 13:00.976
My brother is a killer.

13:01.945 --> 13:04.913
He always has been, he always will be.

13:04.948 --> 13:06.553
You need to go to the D.A.

13:08.536 --> 13:09.084
No.

13:09.118 --> 13:11.753
You're an accessory to murder, Dennis.

13:11.788 --> 13:12.821
The warden is gonna go down for this,

13:12.856 --> 13:15.858
and don't think for a second he
is not gonna take you with him.

13:15.892 --> 13:17.492
- Jackson's right.
- Unless

13:17.527 --> 13:19.294
you tell the truth and you get immunity,

13:19.329 --> 13:21.530
you're going to jail for
the rest of your life.

13:21.564 --> 13:23.465
All of this, everything
you've worked for is gone.

13:23.499 --> 13:25.521
Do you understand
what you're asking me to do?

13:27.533 --> 13:29.345
You want me to betray my own brother?!

13:29.380 --> 13:30.439
SHAWN: Listen to me!

13:30.473 --> 13:33.141
Y'all have the same blood,
but he is not your brother.

13:33.176 --> 13:35.344
You ain't like him.
You're better than he is.

13:35.939 --> 13:37.212
This is the only way.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.882
This is your time to be stronger.

13:42.263 --> 13:44.374
Save yourself while you still can.

13:51.181 --> 13:53.932
♪

13:53.966 --> 13:55.099
(indistinct conversations)

13:55.426 --> 13:57.658
- What's going on?
- We got him, baby.

13:57.692 --> 13:58.785
The warden?

13:58.819 --> 14:01.030
Yeah. Terry, too.
His brother said the warden

14:01.065 --> 14:03.166
took them out to that field,
made Terry kill Petey.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.486
He's in there
telling the D.A. right now.

14:04.533 --> 14:06.167
I don't know why it's taking so long.

14:06.201 --> 14:07.468
They've been in there for an hour.

14:07.502 --> 14:08.653
Hey, they're coming.

14:09.271 --> 14:11.138
Hey, Dennis, how'd it go?

14:11.173 --> 14:11.895
Dennis.

14:14.355 --> 14:15.309
What happened?

14:15.344 --> 14:17.044
He gave us a signed
statement. My assistant's

14:17.079 --> 14:18.679
putting together a murder
warrant on Terry Bausch.

14:18.714 --> 14:19.980
All right, that's good. What about

14:20.015 --> 14:21.982
the warden? Who?

14:22.017 --> 14:24.652
Ray Carroll. Who's putting
the warrant together on him?

14:24.686 --> 14:25.886
Didn't say anything about him.

14:25.921 --> 14:28.356
(elevator bell dings)

14:28.390 --> 14:29.790
JACKSON: Dennis.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.025
Why didn't you tell 'em
about the warden?

14:31.059 --> 14:32.526
Whoever this is, don't talk to him.

14:32.561 --> 14:34.995
What... Who the hell is this?
You got an attorney now? Sir.

14:35.030 --> 14:36.697
Why'd you lie? Why'd you lie?

14:36.732 --> 14:38.699
Who got to you, Dennis?! Dennis!

14:38.734 --> 14:41.228
Something's wrong. What are we missing?

14:42.371 --> 14:44.672
Dennis got scared, that's all.

14:44.706 --> 14:47.074
Figured he's in enough trouble
selling out his brother,

14:47.109 --> 14:48.776
doesn't want the warden
to come after him, too.

14:48.810 --> 14:50.544
You can't screw with the D.A. like that.

14:50.579 --> 14:52.913
As soon as they figure out
he's lied, his immunity's gone.

14:52.948 --> 14:54.415
He's digging his own grave.

14:54.449 --> 14:56.584
(mutters): Just like the one
he dug in Louisiana.

14:56.618 --> 14:57.785
What was that?

14:57.819 --> 14:58.555
Huh?

14:59.488 --> 15:00.668
What did you say?

15:01.256 --> 15:04.258
Just... like the one
he dug in Louisiana.

15:06.661 --> 15:07.848
Louisiana.

15:08.463 --> 15:09.730
Oh, that's it, that's it.

15:09.765 --> 15:10.931
JESSIE: <i>Jackson!</i>

15:10.966 --> 15:12.633
SHAWN: <i>Hey, where you going?</i>

15:12.667 --> 15:14.301
JACKSON: We're going back to the D.A.

15:14.336 --> 15:15.703
<i>I have an idea.</i>

15:15.737 --> 15:16.971
It's gender-neutral,
since you don't know

15:17.005 --> 15:18.672
if you're having a boy or a girl,

15:19.236 --> 15:20.674
- so... Right?
- Not yet.

15:21.400 --> 15:22.810
Thank you, Diana. You didn't have to

15:22.844 --> 15:24.210
come all the way here to give me this.

15:24.235 --> 15:26.514
It's okay, I-I wanted to check on you

15:26.548 --> 15:28.560
and just see how you were doing.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.017
Much better, actually.

15:35.223 --> 15:37.077
Jackson and I have patched things up.

15:37.392 --> 15:38.580
Oh, that's wonderful.

15:39.540 --> 15:40.852
I'm very happy for you.

15:41.885 --> 15:44.116
Diana, why did you hire our firm?

15:45.660 --> 15:46.923
Because of you.

15:47.335 --> 15:48.780
But you've known Aaron
a long time, right?

15:48.815 --> 15:51.572
Yes, and when he told me
that his partner

15:51.606 --> 15:53.095
was a terrific lawyer,

15:53.607 --> 15:56.243
whom he thought that
I would like, I listened.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.279
Why?

16:00.115 --> 16:03.161
I'm concerned about your
relationship with Ray Carroll.

16:05.520 --> 16:06.554
What about him?

16:06.988 --> 16:08.889
Jackson has told me some things.

16:09.951 --> 16:11.183
That he's corrupt.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.167
Well...

16:13.895 --> 16:16.176
I-I wouldn't know about that.

16:16.465 --> 16:18.803
I heard Ray Carroll is gonna be
arrested for murder.

16:21.775 --> 16:22.403
Really?

16:22.437 --> 16:23.737
It involves an inmate

16:23.772 --> 16:26.375
who disappeared
while he was warden at Quitman.

16:26.875 --> 16:28.809
Did you hear this
on the news this morning?

16:28.844 --> 16:31.078
No. It hasn't happened just yet.

16:33.782 --> 16:36.048
You didn't know about any of this?

16:36.384 --> 16:37.832
Absolutely not.

16:40.489 --> 16:41.599
I'm shocked.

16:43.256 --> 16:45.459
This is just exactly
what I'm talking about.

16:47.696 --> 16:48.872
I am lucky

16:49.264 --> 16:52.161
that I have you
watching out for me, so...

16:53.127 --> 16:55.369
I'll get my government affairs
on this right away.

16:55.751 --> 16:57.343
And I'll get
out of your hair now, but...

16:58.727 --> 16:59.875
thanks for the heads-up.

17:02.764 --> 17:04.375
I'm really glad that I stopped by.

17:12.407 --> 17:14.226
During these times... Ray.

17:16.391 --> 17:18.820
I think we have a problem
with Jessie West.

17:19.261 --> 17:20.928
The other night I was working late

17:21.549 --> 17:23.797
and I hear a noise from your office.

17:23.832 --> 17:26.066
So I went to check it out,
nobody was there.

17:26.101 --> 17:27.968
But one of the drawers was half open

17:28.433 --> 17:31.138
and Jud Hamm's donor file was missing.

17:32.436 --> 17:33.173
So?

17:33.208 --> 17:35.976
So I think she took it.
I think she's a mole.

17:36.011 --> 17:38.220
I think she's working for
the opposition's campaign.

17:39.486 --> 17:40.653
Little Jessie?

17:41.879 --> 17:43.717
She's just eye candy.

17:43.752 --> 17:46.220
It's a hunch. She's been acting strange.

17:46.679 --> 17:48.021
You're being paranoid.

17:48.604 --> 17:50.524
That girl is not a mole.

17:50.559 --> 17:52.526
And even if she is,
I'm 18 points ahead...

17:52.561 --> 17:54.762
she must not be very good at it.

17:54.796 --> 17:56.044
I just wanted to bring it up.

17:56.398 --> 17:57.665
All right.

18:02.537 --> 18:05.906
JACKSON: The warden took you out
to that <i>field, he gave you a gun</i>

18:05.941 --> 18:08.165
and he made you kill Petey, didn't he?

18:10.061 --> 18:11.635
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:12.380 --> 18:13.860
All right, listen to me.

18:14.849 --> 18:16.447
Your brother gave you up.

18:17.218 --> 18:19.420
He told us everything
and we're going to the police,

18:19.454 --> 18:21.556
but we don't want you,
we want the warden.

18:22.991 --> 18:24.484
That man is the devil.

18:25.226 --> 18:27.595
You know the only reason
he took you over the border

18:27.629 --> 18:28.702
and made you do it there

18:29.549 --> 18:32.800
is because duress
is not a defense in Louisiana,

18:32.834 --> 18:35.269
which means even
if he put a gun to your head...

18:35.645 --> 18:36.866
and made you shoot...

18:37.572 --> 18:39.573
you're still going down for murder.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.873
You understand that?

18:42.677 --> 18:44.507
The warden manipulated us,

18:44.541 --> 18:45.992
he used us,

18:46.615 --> 18:50.017
and he's gonna take you down
unless you help us.

18:50.051 --> 18:51.852
This is your way out.

18:51.886 --> 18:53.697
I am giving it to you.

18:54.483 --> 18:56.235
All of it can end right now.

18:56.658 --> 18:58.299
All the bad blood,

18:59.082 --> 19:00.661
all the fighting... everything.

19:01.122 --> 19:03.122
All you have to do...

19:03.665 --> 19:04.930
is tell the truth.

19:11.206 --> 19:14.608
Just how stupid
do you think I am, lawyer, hmm?

19:14.927 --> 19:16.071
Tell you the truth?

19:16.344 --> 19:18.746
Turn around. Check him for a tail.

19:22.117 --> 19:24.084
Huh?

19:24.119 --> 19:25.486
All right, go get the car. Hurry up.

19:25.520 --> 19:28.022
Hurry up, make it quick.

19:29.658 --> 19:32.026
OFFICER: Suspect on the move.

19:32.060 --> 19:34.662
We got a visual!

19:34.696 --> 19:36.697
Get out of the vehicle!

19:36.731 --> 19:37.297
(officers shouting)

19:46.875 --> 19:47.841
WINTERS: Hold your fire.
He's got Jackson.

19:47.876 --> 19:49.009
Open the door.

19:49.044 --> 19:50.310
Hold your fire.

19:52.414 --> 19:53.514
(grunts)

20:01.222 --> 20:02.690
Oh, aah!

20:10.265 --> 20:12.266
(grunting)

20:35.023 --> 20:36.924
Okay, that's affirmative. On our way.

20:36.958 --> 20:38.192
You okay?

20:38.226 --> 20:39.426
Yeah, I'm okay.

20:39.887 --> 20:41.095
He got away.

20:41.129 --> 20:42.429
What? No.

20:42.464 --> 20:43.272
He got away.

20:43.698 --> 20:45.532
Aw, man.

20:55.885 --> 20:56.940
Is Jackson okay?

20:56.960 --> 20:58.501
Should be fine.

20:59.362 --> 21:01.710
I tell you what... it's the
bravest thing I've ever seen.

21:01.932 --> 21:04.333
I just... I can't
believe Terry got away!

21:04.367 --> 21:06.702
Look, it's the FBI...
I'm sure they're gonna find him.

21:06.736 --> 21:07.996
Oh, what's it matter, Jessie?

21:08.030 --> 21:09.058
Okay, babe...

21:09.773 --> 21:11.006
you need to calm down.

21:11.041 --> 21:12.596
Listen, Terry knows if he gets arrested,

21:12.621 --> 21:15.318
he's going to prison
for the rest of his life.

21:15.745 --> 21:17.446
There is no chance he's gonna let them

21:17.480 --> 21:18.654
take him alive.

21:19.082 --> 21:20.678
Which means the warden gets away, too.

21:21.051 --> 21:22.585
Maybe you go talk to Dennis again.

21:22.619 --> 21:24.687
How?! We have no idea where he is!

21:24.721 --> 21:25.929
Gil, I know that.

21:26.511 --> 21:27.734
I'm just trying to help.

21:28.158 --> 21:30.325
I know. I know.

21:34.177 --> 21:35.597
I'm sorry, it's...

21:37.287 --> 21:38.501
(sighs)

21:42.005 --> 21:43.512
Oh, we were so close.

21:50.881 --> 21:52.360
What time is the warden's party?

21:52.949 --> 21:54.250
What?

21:54.591 --> 21:55.846
The endorsement thing.

21:56.286 --> 21:58.053
We still have time to get there, right?

21:58.088 --> 22:00.222
Why would we want to do that?
Because I have an idea.

22:00.257 --> 22:02.124
But I can't do it by myself.
Will you help me?

22:03.087 --> 22:04.093
(phone rings)

22:04.127 --> 22:05.227
I'll catch up with you.

22:05.262 --> 22:06.262
Yeah, great.

22:06.296 --> 22:07.463
Winters.

22:07.497 --> 22:10.165
Liz, it's Terry.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.400
You alone?

22:11.434 --> 22:13.302
Yeah. What do you want?

22:13.336 --> 22:16.138
All right, good. Look, I got
ambushed. Lawyer set me up.

22:16.172 --> 22:17.840
FBI's after me right now.

22:17.874 --> 22:20.676
Wait, wait, what, what lawyer?
Slow down. Jackson Brooks?

22:20.710 --> 22:21.810
Look, I don't have time

22:21.845 --> 22:23.145
to explain to you, all right?

22:23.179 --> 22:24.613
Look, I need my go bag.

22:24.648 --> 22:26.982
It's in the shed behind
my house, the corner cabinet.

22:27.017 --> 22:29.351
You're gonna grab it
and you're gonna bring it to me

22:29.386 --> 22:30.419
and you're gonna be alone.

22:30.453 --> 22:31.787
I'm getting my ass to Mexico.

22:31.821 --> 22:33.289
What, are you crazy, Terry?
There is no way

22:33.323 --> 22:35.024
I'm getting involved
in a federal manhunt.

22:35.058 --> 22:36.461
I'm gonna kill your brother.

22:36.993 --> 22:38.861
You understand that, Detective?

22:38.895 --> 22:40.129
(sighs)

22:40.163 --> 22:41.797
It's as easy as a phone call away,

22:41.831 --> 22:43.399
so don't you sit there and pretend

22:43.433 --> 22:45.134
that you got a choice here.

22:45.168 --> 22:47.202
Now, you're gonna meet me
at 10:00 tonight,

22:47.237 --> 22:49.672
61st Street pier at Galveston.

22:49.706 --> 22:51.936
Bring the bag and come alone.

22:53.076 --> 22:56.111
Or the next time you see Robby,
he's gonna be in a bag.

23:01.318 --> 23:03.285
ANNIE: I'm not letting you do this.

23:03.320 --> 23:04.940
You said we were going, so get up.

23:05.484 --> 23:06.239
What's the point?

23:06.692 --> 23:08.424
The point is, Amy was your friend.

23:08.769 --> 23:10.359
And you need to pay your respects.

23:11.595 --> 23:13.295
Don't you understand?

23:14.731 --> 23:16.765
Everything that we've worked for...

23:17.451 --> 23:20.703
everything that's happened
since Boots is all for nothing.

23:20.952 --> 23:22.705
Man, Terry's getting away,

23:22.739 --> 23:24.475
the warden's getting away,

23:24.646 --> 23:26.742
the whole thing is a big damn mess,

23:26.776 --> 23:28.877
so excuse me if I don't feel
like going to the funeral

23:28.912 --> 23:30.613
for a woman I helped get killed.

23:30.914 --> 23:32.617
Shawn, look at me.

23:34.517 --> 23:35.684
I woke up this morning

23:36.170 --> 23:38.931
and I curled my hair.
And I did my makeup.

23:39.555 --> 23:41.580
And I put on this dress.

23:42.258 --> 23:45.651
And do you know the last time
I wore this dress?

23:46.229 --> 23:48.660
It was to my own husband's funeral.

23:49.532 --> 23:51.100
And you know why I did that?

23:51.134 --> 23:53.168
For you. To help you.

23:53.627 --> 23:55.747
The same way
that you have been helping me.

23:56.447 --> 23:58.540
You don't have a franchise on grief.

23:59.131 --> 24:00.164
So...

24:00.877 --> 24:04.279
go find a suit and you
get your ass to my car,

24:04.314 --> 24:06.548
because we are going
to this funeral, Shawn.

24:06.932 --> 24:07.915
Right now.

24:11.060 --> 24:12.259
We're good to go.

24:12.789 --> 24:14.228
I think so.

24:18.161 --> 24:19.695
I love you.

24:19.729 --> 24:20.949
I love you, too.

24:39.582 --> 24:41.340
(phone rings)

24:43.136 --> 24:43.852
Hello?

24:43.887 --> 24:45.521
Hi, Ms. Nagle, it's Janey

24:45.555 --> 24:47.856
calling from Dr. Parson's
office. How are you?

24:47.891 --> 24:49.892
Hi, Janey. I'm good, thank you.

24:49.926 --> 24:52.928
So, we got the labs back
from your 12-week visit,

24:52.962 --> 24:54.763
and everything looks great.

24:55.158 --> 24:56.330
Good.

24:56.366 --> 24:58.333
Do you want to know what you're having?

24:58.368 --> 25:00.402
Uh, Dr. P looked at the ultrasound,

25:00.437 --> 25:03.605
so I can tell you
if it's a boy or a girl.

25:04.047 --> 25:06.507
If you want to know.

25:06.543 --> 25:07.734
Actually, I do.

25:08.211 --> 25:11.980
Well, it's a boy. Congratulations.

25:12.015 --> 25:14.016

26:49.761 --> 26:51.373
I took care of your brother.

26:51.696 --> 26:53.211
I spoke to the D.A.

26:54.715 --> 26:57.735
I told her he's an informant
in one of my RICO cases.

26:57.769 --> 27:01.505
He needs protection, and
they've already moved him.

27:01.833 --> 27:03.162
He is safe.

27:03.475 --> 27:06.457
Terry can't get to him, and
you don't have to be afraid.

27:08.306 --> 27:09.380
Okay. You okay?

27:12.584 --> 27:15.586
We've been in touch.

27:16.588 --> 27:18.222
He called me an hour ago.

27:18.256 --> 27:19.249
What did he say?

27:20.832 --> 27:23.260
He told me he's fleeing the country,

27:24.345 --> 27:25.929
and... he needs me to get his go bag

27:25.964 --> 27:29.266
and to meet him at the
61st Street Pier in Galveston.

27:29.300 --> 27:32.770

You're gonna meet him.
You're gonna arrest him,

27:41.208 --> 27:43.947
and I will explain everything.
I will say I got a tip.

27:43.982 --> 27:45.155
I led you to him.

27:45.180 --> 27:47.284
No. And then he tells the whole
world what I've been doing

27:47.318 --> 27:49.987
for him. It doesn't matter.
Liz, Liz, that is the word

27:50.021 --> 27:52.990
of a murderer and a...
and a drug dealer against a cop.

27:53.024 --> 27:54.925
No one will believe him.

27:54.959 --> 27:56.959
I will vouch for you.

27:56.994 --> 27:59.935
No, I need to go alone.
If he sees you, we lose him.

28:00.965 --> 28:02.933
I need to do this alone. All right.

31:21.599 --> 31:23.100
to accomplish here.

31:24.687 --> 31:26.887
You're making me uncomfortable.

31:27.733 --> 31:28.772
I want to go.

31:28.806 --> 31:30.383
I'm sorry about that.

31:31.709 --> 31:33.443
But I'm sure you'll understand
why I prefer

31:33.478 --> 31:35.286
to have this conversation now.

31:36.180 --> 31:38.181
(phone buzzes)

31:44.188 --> 31:45.822
(crickets chirping)

31:45.857 --> 31:47.332
Marina.

31:47.879 --> 31:50.627
All right, what's this big news
you got for me?

31:50.662 --> 31:52.663
I'm hoping it's...

32:09.047 --> 32:10.514
(car engine starts)

32:12.517 --> 32:14.351
(engine revving, tires screeching)

32:16.921 --> 32:18.922
No. No!

32:20.258 --> 32:22.259
(indistinct chatter)

32:29.634 --> 32:30.991
How you doing, Warden?

32:32.551 --> 32:34.458
You like that picture I sent you?

32:46.333 --> 32:48.366
Hey! Did you hear me?!

32:48.513 --> 32:50.748
You get out of my daughter's stuff!

32:51.783 --> 32:53.421
Jackson!

32:54.732 --> 32:56.221
- Oh, God.
- Out of my way. Out of my way.

32:56.246 --> 32:58.021
What in the hell are you up to?

32:58.056 --> 33:00.024
Hey! Don't you dare!

33:00.058 --> 33:03.728
You come back here, Jackson! Jackson!

33:05.230 --> 33:07.163
I tell you what,
how about we forget the gun?

33:10.235 --> 33:12.794
We go hand-to-hand, just like old times.

33:14.103 --> 33:16.284
You always did like
a good fistfight, didn't you?

33:17.845 --> 33:18.942
'Course, now it'd be

33:18.977 --> 33:20.645
a little different, though, wouldn't it?

33:22.814 --> 33:25.422
I'd kick every single one of
your teeth down your throat.

33:25.850 --> 33:27.126
Yes, you would, son.

33:28.020 --> 33:29.987
You're the toughest son
of a bitch I've ever met

33:30.022 --> 33:31.244
in my entire life.

33:32.224 --> 33:33.252
(scoffs)

33:37.462 --> 33:38.851
I mean it.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.809
First time I saw you,

33:44.804 --> 33:47.171
I thought, "This kid is different.

33:47.205 --> 33:48.484
This kid is special."

33:51.246 --> 33:54.678
You... had more guts inside
of you than boys twice your age.

33:54.713 --> 33:55.880
I always admired you for that.

33:55.914 --> 33:57.131
You need to shut up.

34:00.352 --> 34:02.276
We used to talk about you, you know.

34:03.036 --> 34:05.188
The guards and I used
to sit back and marvel,

34:06.701 --> 34:08.125
saying, "This kid,

34:08.159 --> 34:10.728
"this Gil Harris, he's a survivor.

34:10.762 --> 34:13.411
He's gonna come out of this
stronger on the other side."

34:13.445 --> 34:15.399
Quitman didn't bring you
to your knees...

34:15.434 --> 34:16.940
it brought you to your feet.

34:19.710 --> 34:21.422
I know it's hard to understand.

34:25.784 --> 34:27.344
I know that you're angry.

34:29.554 --> 34:31.277
But we can sit down man to man.

34:35.219 --> 34:36.786
I'm sure we can work this out.

34:38.303 --> 34:40.371
(panting)

34:46.031 --> 34:50.201
I've been thinking about this
moment for 25 years, Ray.

34:51.770 --> 34:52.929
Payback.

34:54.529 --> 34:57.392
For everything you did to me.

34:58.577 --> 35:00.521
What are you gonna do, Gil?
You gonna shoot me?

35:01.857 --> 35:03.289
With the governor and...

35:03.849 --> 35:06.383
half the Texas Highway Patrol
right outside?

35:14.059 --> 35:17.246
I'm not gonna shoot you.

35:19.598 --> 35:21.031
It's much worse than that.

35:21.066 --> 35:22.068
Let's go.

35:22.734 --> 35:25.369
(indistinct chatter)

35:25.403 --> 35:27.371
JESSIE (over microphone):
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:27.405 --> 35:30.168
- can I have your attention, please?
- What the hell is that?

35:30.542 --> 35:33.310
My name is Jessie West, and
I'd like to say something

35:33.345 --> 35:34.583
before we get started.

35:36.038 --> 35:38.616
Tonight I have the pleasure

35:38.650 --> 35:40.618
of introducing you
to the real Ray Carroll.

35:40.652 --> 35:42.159
What the hell does
she think she's doing?

35:42.184 --> 35:43.087
Let her go.

35:43.121 --> 35:45.790
- She's having her moment.
- They say a picture is worth

35:45.824 --> 35:47.336
a thousand words, so...

35:48.493 --> 35:50.329
how about we start with this?

35:51.163 --> 35:54.865
(gasping) This is a 12-year-old
boy who was an inmate at Quitman.

35:54.900 --> 35:57.289
During his time there,
he was systematically drugged,

35:57.769 --> 36:00.288
abused, and tortured by Ray Carroll.

36:01.139 --> 36:02.306
(gasping)

36:02.340 --> 36:04.108
Get her off the stage!

36:04.142 --> 36:07.478
This is a man who exploited
children not only for profit

36:07.512 --> 36:09.213
but for his own sick pleasure, Tuttle!
Kill the projector!

36:09.247 --> 36:10.717
and it's time to tell the truth.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.917
Ray Carroll is a predator.

36:14.252 --> 36:16.954
He doesn't belong in Congress.

36:16.988 --> 36:18.331
He belongs in jail.

36:19.357 --> 36:20.958
(indistinct chatter)

36:20.992 --> 36:22.932
Give me that.

36:22.966 --> 36:24.528
She works

36:24.563 --> 36:26.230
for my opponent's campaign!

36:26.264 --> 36:27.531
She's lying!

36:29.138 --> 36:30.568
Let's go. Now. Governor,

36:31.017 --> 36:32.635
this whole thing

36:32.671 --> 36:33.516
was a setup!

36:34.039 --> 36:35.573
(indistinct chatter)

36:35.607 --> 36:37.141
She's a liar!

36:41.479 --> 36:44.281
(camera shutter sound effect)

37:04.532 --> 37:06.122
Where's my fiancée?

37:06.601 --> 37:08.772
- Jackson...
- You tell me where she is

37:08.807 --> 37:10.641
- or I put a bullet in your brain.
- Look,

37:10.675 --> 37:11.675
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:11.710 --> 37:12.910
Where is she?
What have you done with her?

37:12.944 --> 37:14.578
- I don't know.
- Where is she?!

37:14.613 --> 37:16.013
I swear to God, I don't know.

37:16.047 --> 37:16.747
(grunts)

37:16.781 --> 37:20.117
(panting)

37:20.151 --> 37:22.186
You son of a bitch.
I'm gonna give you three

37:22.220 --> 37:24.355
and I'm taking your head off.
You tell me where she is.

37:24.389 --> 37:26.190
I'm telling you you're wrong.
You tell me where she is.

37:26.224 --> 37:28.792
- I did not touch your fiancée.
- One,

37:28.827 --> 37:29.793
- two...
- You're wrong.

37:29.828 --> 37:30.928
Tell me where she is!

37:30.962 --> 37:32.263
I don't know!

37:32.297 --> 37:34.765
WINTERS: Jackson, don't do it.

37:38.161 --> 37:40.195
Don't do it!

37:40.230 --> 37:41.686
Everything's changed.

37:42.231 --> 37:43.358
He's taken Marina.

37:43.832 --> 37:45.400
Come on, man.

37:45.434 --> 37:48.403
You are not a killer. Drop the gun.

37:50.325 --> 37:51.753
Give me the gun.

37:53.475 --> 37:55.243
Give me the gun.

37:55.893 --> 37:57.712
Give me the gun, man.

38:02.785 --> 38:04.385
I got him.

38:04.420 --> 38:05.965
I got him.

38:10.550 --> 38:12.493
The hell took you so long? Shut up.

38:12.528 --> 38:14.062
Get on the ground!

38:14.096 --> 38:16.064
Put your hands behind your back!

38:16.098 --> 38:19.333
You're under arrest for
the murder of Petey Curtis.

38:19.368 --> 38:21.369
(chuckles)

38:23.005 --> 38:24.439
Don't let him go.

38:24.473 --> 38:26.474
I will drop you.

38:29.278 --> 38:30.778
You lost your damn mind?

38:30.813 --> 38:34.282
You drop me, and I kill your brother.

38:34.316 --> 38:35.205
Yeah?

38:35.718 --> 38:37.061
Give me a reason.

38:38.153 --> 38:40.054
- Liz, don't let him go!
- Terry,

38:40.089 --> 38:42.990
- stop.
- Liz, don't let him go.

38:43.025 --> 38:45.026
Drop him, Liz.

38:45.060 --> 38:46.676
Don't let him go!

38:51.500 --> 38:54.635
Always plan for the unexpected.

38:55.605 --> 38:56.237
(chuckles)

38:56.610 --> 38:58.573
I'll admit that I didn't think
Ray Carroll would go down

38:58.607 --> 38:59.774
quite that way,

38:59.808 --> 39:01.723
but I always knew
it was coming eventually.

39:02.380 --> 39:03.711
And I'm prepared.

39:03.746 --> 39:06.434
I have a dozen just like him
waiting in the wings.

39:06.815 --> 39:08.950
Important thing here
is that Terry's been arrested.

39:08.984 --> 39:11.486
So we have to stick to the plan.

39:12.011 --> 39:13.555
We've got to keep our heads on straight

39:13.589 --> 39:15.556
and just keep moving forward.

39:15.591 --> 39:17.558
With you in charge now.

39:19.703 --> 39:22.498
I expect good things for you, Dennis.

39:22.531 --> 39:24.412
To a bright future together.

39:27.069 --> 39:28.770
What about Jackson Brooks?

39:28.804 --> 39:30.671
I wouldn't worry about him too much.

39:30.706 --> 39:32.733
I've got that situation under control.

39:34.676 --> 39:36.677
(indistinct chatter)

39:51.564 --> 39:53.795
- Jackson, I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

39:53.829 --> 39:56.831
- You hear anything? No?
- No. Nothing yet.

39:59.601 --> 40:01.869
I filed a missing persons report
with the police.

40:01.904 --> 40:03.371
They're telling me
I can't do anything more,

40:03.405 --> 40:05.006
so, uh, I got to wait.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.460
Listen, man. We're gonna find Marina.

40:07.485 --> 40:08.409
- I promise.
- That's right.

40:08.443 --> 40:10.077
- Yeah. You hear anything about Terry?
- Uh, he's, uh...

40:10.112 --> 40:11.546
he's still in the hospital.

40:11.917 --> 40:14.237
In surgery. Liz is waiting for him.

40:14.783 --> 40:17.351
Hey. You heard anything about Marina?

40:17.386 --> 40:18.765
Nothing yet. I'm sorry.

40:18.987 --> 40:19.933
All right.

40:20.322 --> 40:21.889
- What's going on here?
- Well, we've got

40:21.924 --> 40:24.281
two graves already,
but we're still looking.

40:24.315 --> 40:26.727
- That's good work, Shawnie.
- It wasn't me, man.

40:26.762 --> 40:30.131
- All Amy. You know, it's just...
- Really sad.

40:30.165 --> 40:32.700
Did you get into an accident
on your way over here?

40:32.734 --> 40:35.069
- Back into something?
- No. No.

40:47.416 --> 40:50.318
(gasps)

40:50.352 --> 40:52.253
(shuddering breaths)

40:52.287 --> 40:55.256
No. No.

40:55.290 --> 40:58.559
- No!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

40:58.594 --> 41:00.761
No, no, no, Jackie.
Jackie, Jackie... No!

41:00.796 --> 41:03.631
GIL: No, no. Get an... get an ambulance!

41:03.665 --> 41:06.834
Get an ambulance!

41:07.870 --> 41:10.504
Please. (sobbing)

41:10.539 --> 41:14.508
Help! No, no, no.

41:14.543 --> 41:18.079
Oh, baby. Oh... (sobbing)
