00:27.194 --> 00:28.695
He's taking a shit.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.864
- Right now.
- Not gonna rap for a guy taking a shit.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.117
- Rahmel, sir?
- Shut the fuck up!

00:34.201 --> 00:37.120
I understand this is a bit unorthodox,
but my guy OH! Here

00:37.204 --> 00:39.915
is the hottest rapper in the streets
without a record deal.

00:39.998 --> 00:44.336
So, hold on to that seat, 'cause he's
about to drop some shit for you.

00:44.836 --> 00:45.836

Happy?

01:47.441 --> 01:50.402
- That the flush of a record deal, Rahmel?
- Ha!

01:50.569 --> 01:51.820
Rahmel is in LA.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.364
That's his intern, Bernard.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.783
Yo, Bernie, pick that up!

01:58.035 --> 02:00.245
You could have said something, Bernie.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.414
Why would I do that?
That was actually hot.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.624
I fucks with OH!

02:04.124 --> 02:05.500
After you wash, my G.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.669
Bernard, please tell Rahmel
to come see OH! This Thursday

02:08.753 --> 02:12.132
at Charlamagne's Up Next MC Showcase.
Sure to be lit as tits.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.301
"Lit as tits."

02:14.801 --> 02:18.430
A basement full of broke-ass
SoundCloud rappers and zero bitches

02:18.513 --> 02:19.848
is gonna be "lit as tits"?

02:20.307 --> 02:22.787
I mean, no offense, man, you're nice,
but that sounds horrible.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.603
Okay. No, that's one way of looking at it.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.081
But another is, what could be more lit
than showing your boss

02:27.105 --> 02:29.524
you discovered the next 21 Savage

02:29.691 --> 02:32.069
and then possibly getting
a producer credit on the album?

02:32.235 --> 02:33.070
You gangsta?

02:33.153 --> 02:33.987
Mm-hmm.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.323
You in that murder gang shit?
Slaughter gang shit?

02:36.406 --> 02:37.574
- Not really.
- You hard?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.159
You shoot somebody's mom before?

02:39.785 --> 02:41.912
Dude, just shoot my mom.
She's a total fucking bitch.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.624
I'll tell you this. Why don't y'all change
that producer credit

02:45.707 --> 02:47.376
to an executive producer credit

02:47.584 --> 02:49.878
and I'll make sure Rahmel
is front row center on Thursday.

02:49.961 --> 02:50.961
Done.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.923
- All right.
- All right.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.257
- I'll see y'all.
- See ya.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.551
Wait, who let y'all in here?

02:58.136 --> 02:59.136
Shit...

03:00.555 --> 03:02.683
- The higher-ups.
- Security. The higher-ups.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.685
Can I ask you a question?

03:04.768 --> 03:07.437
Bro, I do not know if my sister
is dating anybody, okay?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.772
She's post-feminist,

03:08.855 --> 03:11.650
which I'm now realizing just means
she fucks a lot.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.194
Okay. Not really about your sister.

03:14.403 --> 03:15.403
For once.

03:15.946 --> 03:20.367
Do you think I actually have the talent
to do this shit for real?

03:20.450 --> 03:21.326
Seriously?

03:21.410 --> 03:23.745
Okay, I'm not even gonna dignify that
with a response.

03:23.829 --> 03:24.913
What's missing then?

03:24.996 --> 03:27.249
'Cause we've been going hard
for like three years,

03:27.332 --> 03:30.377
shooting music videos,
doing every MC battle...

03:30.460 --> 03:33.547
<i>open mic night, and fucking podcast
we can possibly find.</i>

03:33.630 --> 03:36.800
We've dropped not one, not two, not three,
but four mixtapes.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.261
Four. Nobody does that, not even Future.

03:39.344 --> 03:43.765
- Fifth one's gonna be the one, my guy.
- I have 7,402 Instagram followers.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.350
I don't even have a fucking K.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.061
You know how embarrassing that is
as a rapper to not have a K?

03:48.145 --> 03:51.064
My mom's meatloaf fan page has a K,
and that shit's on private.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.900
Owen, the genius thing we did
was never give up.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.444
C'mon, who said that?

03:55.527 --> 03:57.727
You really gotta chill
with the motivational memes, bro.

03:57.779 --> 03:58.864
Jay-Z said that.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.574
So, if you're not gonna listen to me,

04:00.657 --> 04:03.201
listen to the guy that gets to
put his D in B on the reg,

04:03.285 --> 04:05.036
all because he never gave up.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.998
Even when every record label passed
on Hova God.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.959
My pops mentioned enlisting again
last night.

04:12.919 --> 04:16.923
I still go Kendrick, Cole, Rocky,

04:17.466 --> 04:19.843
Chance, Pusha T.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.555
How are you not on your own
top five list of lyricists?

04:24.222 --> 04:25.348
Because I have ears.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.852
My top five goes OH! Number one always,
okay?

04:28.935 --> 04:33.106
Then you have Quavo, Lil Uzi,
Lil Wayne, Lil Pump.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.816
Okay, that's a lot of littles.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.527
Kids don't know shit
about real hip hop, yo.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.155
What about the god Rakim?

04:40.238 --> 04:42.824
- Is he on Spotify?
- Sir, how do you spell Rakim?

04:42.908 --> 04:44.409
You kidding me? He's an icon.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.497

04:48.580 --> 04:50.749

All right, so y'all not total fuck boys
after all.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.015
No, sir. No, we're not.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.017
Well, then,
why is your man dressed like it?

05:09.518 --> 05:10.560
My outfit is fire.

05:10.644 --> 05:14.231
Your outfit is wow corny, son.
Who you trying to be?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.357
Myself.

05:16.566 --> 05:17.651
With a hint of the Migos.

05:18.819 --> 05:19.986
Is it too much, Migos?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.530
- Way too much Migos.
- Listen.

05:21.613 --> 05:24.699
The culture is dying
and y'all are the future.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.493
Do me a favor.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.829
Don't fuck up the future.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.540
Oh, we're gonna fuck up the future.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.042
No, but like in a good way.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.711
Like how Future fucks up some commas,
you know?

05:36.962 --> 05:37.962
Right?

05:48.431 --> 05:49.431
Damn.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.143
Dude, have I told you how fucking little

05:52.227 --> 05:53.987
I'm gonna miss these bitches
from high school

05:54.062 --> 05:57.065
when you and I are on that main
festival stage just crushing the game?

05:57.148 --> 05:58.733
- Six-thousand times.
- Yeah.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.908
We gotta think of some other shit.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.660
- This is weird.
- You don't like it?

06:08.743 --> 06:11.204
We'll scrap it. I'm gonna home,
gonna workshop some shit,

06:11.288 --> 06:13.456
and then I'm gonna
send you some options, okay?

06:13.540 --> 06:15.709
- Think of something.
- I will. I promise.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.377
- All right, fam.
- All right, man.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.544
I love you!

06:18.587 --> 06:19.796
Don't say that out loud.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.814
Don't worry, Owen. You're fine.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.985
Jeffrey, your friend
walked in on me again.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.600
His name is Carlos, he's Dominican,
and I like it 'cause...

06:47.657 --> 06:49.117
Hey, Alicia.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.285
Hi, Owen.

06:52.370 --> 06:57.626
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I got a show next week in the city

06:57.709 --> 07:00.754
and I wanted to see, like,
if you weren't doing anything,

07:00.837 --> 07:04.007
if you wanted to like, come by,
if you're not busy.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.259
Even though you're probably like
hella busy.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.839
Owen is a rapper
and my little brother is his manager.

07:10.221 --> 07:11.221
Oh, cute.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.809
Yeah. So, it's this Thursday,

07:14.893 --> 07:17.103
and, Dad, it's gonna be
the biggest show of our career.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.647
Like, it's gonna be lit up in there.

07:19.064 --> 07:22.734
A lot of cool people are gonna be there.
Remember that guy, Ski Mask the Slump God?

07:22.817 --> 07:24.819
Yeah? I played you his music
and you were like,

07:24.903 --> 07:27.405
"Is this really the music
you kids listen to nowadays?"

07:28.198 --> 07:30.951
I mean, it would be super tight
if you came to support us.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.634
You're not gonna have time to play
rap manager at Harvard next year

07:35.705 --> 07:38.792
with your pre-law course load,
plus your internship

07:38.875 --> 07:42.754
at Slowski Scheinbaum Saperstein
Selquwitz and Mascarpone.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.255
Fuck my life.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.054
What does this idiot want?

07:52.389 --> 07:53.765
Hey, big guy!

07:54.224 --> 07:56.101
Yeah, I was just thinking about you.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.143
How was Napa?

08:09.739 --> 08:12.158
You ready?
Wanna run some lines or something?

08:12.242 --> 08:14.369
No, I'm good. I got my lines already.

08:14.452 --> 08:17.288
You look nervous. Now, remember how
we talked about confidence, right?

08:17.372 --> 08:18.540
- Confidence.
- Thanks.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.251
Yo, this place is actually full.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.421
You ready to kill tonight, my guy?

08:24.504 --> 08:25.504
- Yeah.
- Good.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.298
Your sister out there?

08:27.382 --> 08:29.527
Would you stop thinking
about my sister for one second?

08:29.551 --> 08:31.720
- She's never gonna fuck you. I'm sorry.
- Hey!

08:31.803 --> 08:32.636
I'm sorry, Sarge,

08:32.721 --> 08:35.390
but tonight is not the time
to be focusing on trivial things

08:35.472 --> 08:36.558
like my sister's punanjo.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.684
Tonight's about fate, it's about destiny.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.645
And, most importantly,
it's about murdering that mic out there.

08:41.730 --> 08:42.730
So, she's not here.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.233
- No, she's not here.
- But I'm here.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.153
I'm gonna be on that front row
waiting for you.

08:48.778 --> 08:52.282
Thanks, Dad. Not really the same thing,
but I appreciate it.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.325
I know. I love you, boy.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.746
- All right.
- You have such a supportive father.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.540
Have fun out there. And smile. Smile.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.376
Hey, there you go.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.794
Wow, what a guy.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.047
- Yeah, he's cool.
- Love him. He's great.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.340
Yo, did you eat?
Because you look a little green.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.259
- I can see it in your face.
- No, I'm good.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.427
You ever had ikura?

09:13.136 --> 09:15.597
They're like these little salty balls
of goodness

09:15.680 --> 09:17.432
- just exploding with flavor.
- Oh, my God.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.035
- You gotta try it.
- Back that shit up.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.204
You don't even have to eat it. Just stick
your tongue out and lick a little ball.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.022
Yo, pause. What is wrong with you?

09:24.105 --> 09:25.732
- It's fine...
- Back the fuck up...

09:26.733 --> 09:28.610
Am I interrupting something right now?

09:28.693 --> 09:29.693
Shit.

09:29.736 --> 09:30.570
- Yo!
- Nah!

09:30.653 --> 09:31.964
- What's up, Bernard?
- Cool, man.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.990
Cool. Did you bring Rahmel with you?

09:34.074 --> 09:36.576
Nah, I got someone even better.
Y'all know Wiz?

09:40.163 --> 09:41.163
Yeah.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.333
- That's Wiz Khalifa.
- Yes.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.376
Wow, huge fan. Tight.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.047
- You smoke?
- Like...

09:49.464 --> 09:51.716
Like, not all the time. A little bit.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.928
If your definition of a little something
is all day every day.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.490
- We love weed.
- Shut the fuck up. What are you doing?

09:57.514 --> 09:59.394
One pic of you chiefing a joint
with Wiz Khalifa

09:59.474 --> 10:01.518
gets us 10,000 fans on Instagram, easy.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.728
- Pass that I, Wiz.
- Shut the fuck up.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.439
- There you go.
- Yeah.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.149
Get in there.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.902
Owen, put up a peace sign.
Put up a peace sign now.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.738
Now, blow a cloud. There you go. Nice.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.699
- Awesome. Give me some.
- Good luck out there, man.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.787
Bernard told me you pretty nice,
so do your thing.

10:20.870 --> 10:21.996
- Thanks, man.
- All right.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.998
I know this will come as no surprise
to anyone,

10:24.082 --> 10:26.334
but Wiz Khalifa has
some incredibly strong weed.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.857
Thank you, everybody. Have a good night!

10:52.068 --> 10:54.571
Hey, keep that energy going
for Ski, y'all!

10:55.655 --> 10:58.366
I don't know what he just said,
but I felt it.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.495
I don't know who wants to follow that,
but I think I found somebody.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.914
Make some noise for OH!, y'all!

11:06.416 --> 11:09.002
OH!, where you at? Where you at, OH!?
Where you at?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.171
Okay.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.176
- How you feeling tonight, man? You good?
- Good. Yeah.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.678
Don't make me look bad for
putting you up on the stage, okay?

11:18.761 --> 11:20.597
- Okay.
- Okay? 'Cause you look whack.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.640
You look like Klay Thompson
with Down Syndrome.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.726
- All right. Okay, for sure.
- Don't embarrass me.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.185
Thanks.

Yo, Wiz, this shit is strong, nigga.
I'm fuckin' smacked.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.120
Yo, what's...

12:30.792 --> 12:32.877
Yo, I'm fucking sorry. I didn't...

12:41.052 --> 12:43.554
- He's having a seizure!
- Not my Yeezys, bro!

12:45.932 --> 12:47.392
WorldStar!

12:55.858 --> 12:57.652
Best "can't un-see it" clip
of all time.

12:57.735 --> 13:01.364
He threw up on Wiz Khalifa
at Charlamagne's Up Next music showcase.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.700
I guess after smoking with Wiz,
he couldn't handle it.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.410
He tried to be cool, tried to be down...

13:05.493 --> 13:07.013
Get him outta here. This kid's washed.

13:07.078 --> 13:08.997
You can't rhyme and you can't smoke weed.

13:09.080 --> 13:12.375
Motherfucker, don't smoke
if you can't hold it, Seezjah Boy.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.085
<i>Everybody is calling him "Seezjah Boy."</i>

13:14.168 --> 13:16.296
<i>You caught a fuckin' seizure,
you corny motherfucker!</i>

13:16.379 --> 13:18.589
<i>That name is completely offensive,
but I have to admit,</i>

13:18.673 --> 13:21.092
<i>the seizure dance they got from it
is kinda funny.</i>

13:21.175 --> 13:22.615
<i>Didn't know he was having a seizure.</i>

13:22.677 --> 13:24.437
<i>I thought he was
on the floor Harlem Shaking.</i>

13:24.512 --> 13:27.056
- Is it over for this guy?
- Stick a fork in him. He done.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.411
You ever heard of the saying
that no press is bad press?

13:49.120 --> 13:50.955
Also, when did you become Creed?

13:51.414 --> 13:52.707
I'm joining the Marines.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.336
You're a funny guy.
You know that? You're funny.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.712
I'm dead-ass, bro.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.965
Dude, no. Don't say dead-ass
when you're not actually dead-ass.

14:01.049 --> 14:03.384
That's not cool, man.
It's toying with my emotions.

14:04.719 --> 14:05.887
I'm dead-ass, bro.

14:07.138 --> 14:08.723
Owen, why would you ever do that?

14:08.806 --> 14:10.892
Because my dad served in the Marines

14:10.975 --> 14:14.145
and his life turned out pretty sick
compared to my current life.

14:14.228 --> 14:17.190
He owns a fake Chipotle
called Chip O'Lees.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.526
My guy, he is one cease and desist letter
away from going bust.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.820
Woah! Don't be a dick, okay?

14:22.904 --> 14:25.948
That was his dream and he
worked his ass off to make it happen.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.657
Okay.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.411
Sorry, but what about your dream?

14:30.870 --> 14:31.870
Huh?

14:32.830 --> 14:37.251
Come on, making music, touring the world,
connecting with your fans,

14:37.335 --> 14:40.463
and a little thing called
sex with groupies.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.507
I am an Internet laughingstock.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.967
Groupies... out the window.

14:45.343 --> 14:48.429
World tours... out the fucking window.

14:51.682 --> 14:54.602
I mean, come on, man,
we don't even need a record label, okay?

14:54.685 --> 14:58.106
- We can do this shit independent.
- We've been doing it independent.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.857
That's what we're doing right now.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.110
That's what this is. Independent as hell.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.278
My dad called in a favor.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.614
I'm driving to Parris Island on Friday.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.950
Remember what I told you in ninth grade

15:09.033 --> 15:11.577
after you lost to Young-Suk Kim
in the talent show?

15:11.953 --> 15:15.415
<i>I want to thank Ms. Farrow,
Mr. Skoggins, my...</i>

15:15.540 --> 15:17.542
I'm really happy for you.
I'm gonna let you finish.

15:17.625 --> 15:21.212
<i>But Owen had one of the best
talent show performances of all time.</i>

15:21.337 --> 15:22.964
<i>Of all time.</i>

15:23.047 --> 15:27.176
I made you a promise that if you let me
be your manager, I would go HAM for you.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.345
And I'm going to keep that promise.

15:29.470 --> 15:32.056
I may look like a Jewy fuck boi
on the surface,

15:32.140 --> 15:34.767
but underneath these $900 Balmain jeans,

15:34.851 --> 15:37.311
which I only bought because A$AP Rocky
wears them,

15:37.395 --> 15:39.439
which are uncomfortable as fuck,
by the way,

15:39.522 --> 15:43.234
underneath all that shit,
I'm a fucking animal.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.321
Yo, bro.

15:47.572 --> 15:48.865
Yeah, bro.

15:49.407 --> 15:52.368
I get you a record deal by this Friday,

15:53.536 --> 15:55.121
and you don't join the Marines.

15:55.538 --> 15:56.956
- Okay, bro.
- Yeah?

15:57.373 --> 15:58.458
- Whatever.
- Wait, really?

15:58.541 --> 16:00.334
- Yeah, knock yourself out.
- Yes! Thank you.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.004
Yes, agreement. Yes, dude.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.422
- Okay.
- Yes!

16:04.505 --> 16:06.757
There's gonna motivational memes
about this shit.

16:09.594 --> 16:10.845
Coming through! Watch out!

16:31.032 --> 16:33.159
I told her don't worry
about where I live right now.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.994
I'm in between places, all right?

16:35.119 --> 16:36.621
You know, my mom's place...

16:37.538 --> 16:39.081
Oh, shit, I gotta get back to work.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.877
I see you avoiding me, Bernard.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.796
You're talking on a calculator.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.340
Yo, the Gucci vocals come in?

16:49.217 --> 16:50.510
- Hi.
- Hello.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.094
- Can I help you?
- Yes!

16:52.178 --> 16:54.055
I'm OH!'s manager. Here to see Rahmel.

16:54.847 --> 16:55.847
Who?

16:56.849 --> 16:58.142
Seezjah Boy's manager.

16:58.726 --> 17:02.271
Oh, that's too bad.
I really loved his mixtape.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.941
He would have been great at Atlantic.

17:05.107 --> 17:08.861
He's not dead.
He can still be great at Atlantic.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.571
Are you kidding me?
He's deader than dubstep.

17:14.075 --> 17:14.992
That's funny.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.703
Let me tell you something else.
Opinions are like assholes.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.373
Everyone's got one,
but no one thinks theirs stinks.

17:20.957 --> 17:23.751
Who doesn't think their asshole stinks?
That's dumb.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.461
Look, can I see Rahmel, please?

17:25.545 --> 17:28.047
He's working from home today.
But good luck to you.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.970
Hey, Bernard,
how are those Gucci vocals looking?

17:33.177 --> 17:35.471
You sent them? Cool.
I'm checking right now.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.057
Tight. Those are fakes Yeezys.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.353
No such thing as bad press, right?

17:44.480 --> 17:47.525
Have you never had a stomach bug?
'Cause they can be devastating.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.444
Why can't this be his Eminem
"mom's spaghetti" moment?

17:51.279 --> 17:52.279
Sorry.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.739
Can't touch him.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.118
He's tainted goods. Sorry, kid.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.538
Dude, you want me to sign Seezjah Boy?

18:01.998 --> 18:03.457
Is it "seezjah" or "seizure"?

18:03.541 --> 18:05.876
And by the way,
you know that's politically incorrect.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.421
And really fucking offensive.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.678
Chicken. Rice.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.139
More rice.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.142
More rice.

18:21.851 --> 18:22.977
Six, six, six.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.818
Fuckin' know you, dude.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.946
I knew it.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.363
You're Seezjah Boy.

18:35.406 --> 18:36.407
- Nah.
- No?

18:36.490 --> 18:38.284
Nah, not at all. No.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.368
Fuck am I doing?

18:39.785 --> 18:42.997
Oh, you're fucking Seezjah Boy.
We're going live with this shit.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.499
Yo, what the fuck is up, Internet?

18:45.583 --> 18:47.293
It's your boy, YungDouglas.

18:47.543 --> 18:51.088
Who am I with?
Fucking Seezjah Boy, live and direct.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.966
Round two. He's about to puke
all over my fucking neck.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.426
Do it. C'mon, let's go.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.011
Everybody, a little encouragement.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.805
Barf!

18:59.889 --> 19:01.974
Dude, I'm trying to get laid.
Fuckin' puke on me.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.101
Fucking throw chicken at me.
Throw a burrito at me.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.859
Mohammad, it's so hot out.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.736
I need a cold iced coffee.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.365
- You're not Mohammad.
- No, I am not.

19:17.448 --> 19:20.326
But, between us,
I make a much better iced coffee.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.828
- What do you want?
- A sit-down with Rahmel.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.622
- Not gonna happen.
- You said for yourself

19:24.705 --> 19:27.583
you loved OH!'s mixtape,
and I am telling you he's a star.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.335
Now trust your gut.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.837
Forget about the Internet
for one goddamn second

19:31.921 --> 19:33.255
and focus on the music.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.019
I like your passion, but I need my coffee.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.301
I like your face, eyes, hair, <i>and</i> smile.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.931
All right, maybe I can
get you in with Rahmel next week.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.724
That's amazing. One thing.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.018
OH!'s joining the Marines tomorrow,

19:46.102 --> 19:48.521
so I'm begging you to figure out something
for today.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.981
- You're being very pushy.
- Some people find it charming.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.065
I'm not one of them.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.568
Come by the Gramercy tonight.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.613
I could probably get you in
at the secret French show.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.951
"French" as in "Montana"?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.285
The one and only.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.996
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

20:06.080 --> 20:10.000
Look, I promise...
we are not gonna let you down.

20:12.670 --> 20:13.670
Hey.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.088
Hey.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.679
You're not gonna need
a whole lot of wardrobe options, son.

20:21.762 --> 20:22.805
It's a lot of camo.

20:22.888 --> 20:23.888
I know.

20:36.444 --> 20:37.778
<i>♪ Hey, look here, homie ♪</i>

20:38.070 --> 20:41.115

Come on, now. Don't fight the feeling.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.386
You got that steel from me.
Don't fight it.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.670
Hey, I don't know if I ever told you this,

20:54.754 --> 20:58.883
but when I was your age,
I had dreams of being an actor.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.178
- You did?
- Yeah.

21:02.428 --> 21:06.682
Yeah, I took classes.
I did some plays and I had a fly headshot.

21:08.476 --> 21:10.728
I was gonna be the next Rico Tubbs.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.566
You know, the brother on <i>Miami Vice.</i>

21:16.942 --> 21:19.069
Have you never seen an episode
of <i>Miami Vice?</i>

21:19.153 --> 21:20.488
You mean like with Jamie Foxx?

21:21.697 --> 21:24.283
- You were trying to be like Jamie Foxx?
- Okay, I'm old.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.366
The point is...

21:26.619 --> 21:27.703
I get it, son.

21:28.913 --> 21:32.249
Being a Marine might not be as cool
as being Kendrick Lamar, but...

21:33.334 --> 21:35.044
sometimes we have to accept our fate.

21:35.169 --> 21:36.837
Everybody doesn't get everything.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.174
But what if I'm accepting my fate, like,
way too soon?

21:40.257 --> 21:42.426
Boy, you threw up on Wiz Khalifa
and it went viral.

21:43.177 --> 21:45.262
Come on, son, you gotta face the facts.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.306
Nobody really makes it as a rapper.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.226
At some point, we all have to grow up.

22:09.954 --> 22:10.996
Alicia.

22:11.539 --> 22:14.250
Hey. Somebody still like Arnie Palmies?

22:17.461 --> 22:19.255
Look, Alicia, please.

22:19.547 --> 22:22.049
I am on my knees. Look at me.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.592
Bet you say that to all the boys.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.929
It's French Montana.
You loved him when he dated Khloe.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.807
- True.
- All you gotta do is be nice to Owen

22:29.890 --> 22:32.184
and not mention
that you have a new boyfriend.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.270
- Very important. Don't do that.
- Not possible.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.355
Said new boyfriend
is having a party tonight

22:36.438 --> 22:37.606
and I have to be there.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.191
Alicia, Owen needs your help.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.735
I mean, he's joining the Marines tomorrow.
Come on.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.445
Have some sympathy for our troops.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.365
Look, I feel really bad for Owen, I do.

22:47.241 --> 22:49.243
But I just... I can't tonight.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.205
You know what? I'll pay you.

22:53.289 --> 22:54.289
No!

22:55.207 --> 22:58.544
- How much?
- 20,000 United States dollars.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.589
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

23:01.672 --> 23:04.216
- You don't have that kind of money.
- Oh, I swear to God I do.

23:04.341 --> 23:05.341
Yes, I do.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.345
But you have to swear on Dad's life
that you're in. Okay?

23:10.723 --> 23:13.309
All I have to do is go to a secret
French Montana show

23:13.392 --> 23:16.061
and you will pay me 20,000
United States dollars?

23:16.896 --> 23:19.773
- Not that "doll hair" shit you pulled?
- Dollars. Okay?

23:19.857 --> 23:20.857
Think about it.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.108
Fine.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.362
- I'm in.
- Okay. Done deal. Good.

23:25.446 --> 23:30.159
20,000 United States dollars in low-risk
government-backed agricultural bonds.

23:30.242 --> 23:33.078
They'll mature in 2050.
That's my graduation gift from Uncle Alan,

23:33.162 --> 23:36.165
- it's yours now. So <i>mazel tov!</i>
- What? Fuck that, Jeffrey.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.253
Hey, what's good, Lucy?

23:41.337 --> 23:43.672
Keeping that burrito nice and tight
like I like it?

23:43.756 --> 23:46.258
Don't make me smack you upside your head
with a chimichanga,

23:46.425 --> 23:48.677
- Cause you know I'll do it.
<i>- Caliente.</i>

23:51.138 --> 23:54.558
There he is, the guy who could be
the next greatest rapper alive

23:54.642 --> 23:58.479
and threw it all away to fight for our
freedom like the all-American hero he is.

23:58.562 --> 24:01.315
Wanna turn that shit down?
You can't play music in here.

24:01.398 --> 24:02.524
Okay. All good.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.818
'Cause we're going to see the man live,
tonight.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.987
- Wait, what?
- It's my send-off to you,

24:07.071 --> 24:09.698
front row seats at a top secret
French Montana show.

24:09.782 --> 24:10.616
Seriously?

24:10.699 --> 24:12.242
Would I joke about Frenchie?

24:14.161 --> 24:15.329
Come on, outside.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.666
Oh, shit, your dad let you take the Rolls?

24:18.749 --> 24:21.877
Well, not exactly,
but it's your last night of freedom.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.420
We gotta go big, baby.

24:24.254 --> 24:26.298
Man, I really want to,

24:26.382 --> 24:31.011
but my moms is making like
a send-off dinner or something. Meatloaf.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.139
- You're invited if you want.
- I'm talking about front row seats

24:34.223 --> 24:37.226
to a French Montana show.
You're talking about meatloaf?

24:50.948 --> 24:53.033
Can I get a key to the restroom,
<i>por favor?</i>

24:54.827 --> 24:55.827
Hmm?

24:56.620 --> 24:58.163
I gotta pee. Need the key.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.791
Oh, yes.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.543
Duh, my bad.

25:03.544 --> 25:05.963
You asked for the key, so...

25:06.046 --> 25:08.215
You're coming with us
to see French Montana, I hope.

25:12.136 --> 25:13.220
Is your sister coming?

25:13.303 --> 25:16.223
Dude, is your pop's restaurant
a total Chipotle knock-off?

25:16.515 --> 25:17.683
Is she even single though?

25:18.058 --> 25:19.601
Single and ready to mingle.

25:22.438 --> 25:23.731
So, Alicia...

25:24.857 --> 25:26.150
how was your summer?

25:27.317 --> 25:28.317
Fine.

25:30.821 --> 25:33.323
You go on any, like, sick trips?

25:34.825 --> 25:35.826
Not really.

25:37.953 --> 25:38.953
Sick.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.624
You watch any movies this summer?

25:42.708 --> 25:44.960
I'm not really into Hollywood movies.

25:45.294 --> 25:48.088
I'm more into like French New Wave, so.

25:48.172 --> 25:50.507
Word. Yo, I fucks with French New Wave.

25:50.841 --> 25:52.009
Oh, you fuck with it?

25:52.092 --> 25:54.053
I mean, obviously, <i>Breathless</i> is my shit.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.223
Okay. All right.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.058
Good on you.

26:02.186 --> 26:04.188
I'm sorry about the Seezjah Boy thing.

26:05.481 --> 26:06.857
- It's cool.
- Yeah?

26:06.940 --> 26:08.960
- You know, it's gonna blow over.
- Now the Marines?

26:08.984 --> 26:11.111
Yep. You know, you gotta keep it moving.

26:11.612 --> 26:13.280
Everybody doesn't get everything, right?

26:13.781 --> 26:15.324
I mean, that's just life, right?

26:15.699 --> 26:16.700
I hope not.

26:18.202 --> 26:19.202
Yeah.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.832
Hey, driver?
Could you please turn up the air?

26:23.916 --> 26:25.626
It's really hot in here.
Thank you so much.

26:25.709 --> 26:28.462
One of you needs to come up here, okay?
This is some bullshit.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.047
- Sir!
- Bullshit!

26:38.847 --> 26:40.682
Where the hell is this guy?

26:40.766 --> 26:42.351
- Should I honk again?
- No.

26:50.234 --> 26:51.234
Hello!

26:51.485 --> 26:52.903
Hello, anybody here?

27:01.662 --> 27:03.247
Yo! Hey, there.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.457
Are you the gentleman parking my car?

27:05.541 --> 27:07.918
Because I'm sort of particular
about the whole thing.

27:08.252 --> 27:10.921
Just leave the keys over on the desk.
I'll get to it in a few, man.

27:13.048 --> 27:16.385
- Wait, dude, are you watching porn?
- No, it's an educational video.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.720
That doctor is titty-fucking two nurses
at the same time.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.722
- Yeah, I'm pre-med, man.
- Wow.

27:20.848 --> 27:23.851
Okay, I can't even believe that
I have to say this right now,

27:23.934 --> 27:26.395
but please don't jerk off in my car,
all right?

27:26.478 --> 27:28.272
- Which one was yours?
- The white one.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.606
Big Phantom, right there.

27:29.690 --> 27:30.566
I got you.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.318
- Semen-free zone.
- You're good, man. I'll take care of you.

27:37.531 --> 27:39.158
- <i>Help you?</i>
- Gonna drop me a beat?

27:39.241 --> 27:40.117
- No.
- Yeah.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.078
<i>♪ Okay, last name Levine
First name Jeffrey ♪</i>

27:43.162 --> 27:45.914
<i>♪ Like a sprained ankle, boy
You'd better check me ♪</i>

27:47.666 --> 27:50.210
Sorry. Can you check under Jeffrey Levine
for me, please?

27:51.003 --> 27:52.713
<i>- Yeah, I don't have you.</i>
- What?

27:53.046 --> 27:55.299
No, that can't be.
You checked Rahmel's list?

27:55.382 --> 27:57.509
<i>- I did.</i>
- Can you check under OH!, please?

27:57.593 --> 28:00.012
It's spelled capital O, capital H,
exclamation point.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.681
<i>- There's no "OH!"
- </i> What about...

28:04.975 --> 28:05.976
Seezjah Boy?

28:07.895 --> 28:09.521
<i>Oh, my God, that is you.</i>

28:10.189 --> 28:11.899
<i>Oh, my God, are you okay?</i>

28:12.149 --> 28:14.067
Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.

28:14.151 --> 28:16.904
<i>I don't have you here either,
so I can't let you guys in.</i>

28:17.571 --> 28:19.198
Oh, fuck a duck!

28:20.032 --> 28:21.116
- Sorry.
<i>- Wait!</i>

28:21.450 --> 28:25.162
<i>If I could just really quickly
just get like a... for my son?</i>

28:25.245 --> 28:26.663
<i>You know what I mean? Just my...</i>

28:27.706 --> 28:29.249
<i>But you gotta do the thing!</i>

28:29.458 --> 28:30.792
<i>Just do the thing, you know.</i>

28:31.376 --> 28:32.376
<i>Do the thing.</i>

28:33.503 --> 28:35.422
<i>That's good! That's really good.</i>

28:35.839 --> 28:36.757
Okay.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.840
Thanks.

28:38.425 --> 28:39.343
<i>Bye, baby.</i>

28:39.426 --> 28:42.596
Jessica, this is my fifth voicemail.
Do I need to send you a fucking raven?

28:42.679 --> 28:44.681
You're making me look awful
in front of my client.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.517
Jeff's head is about to pop off.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.562
His heart is in the right place,
but he needs to stop spazzing out.

28:50.646 --> 28:51.813
He's turning into our Dad.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.107
That's like his biggest fear in life.

28:54.191 --> 28:57.152
Mine is drowning, but turning
into my mother is a close second.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.779
I kinda like your mom.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.824
Is everything cool or...?

29:03.992 --> 29:06.203
I am so sorry. I have to go.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.081
But good luck in the Marines.
You're gonna be great.

29:13.502 --> 29:14.586
Where you going?

29:14.795 --> 29:16.588
I gotta meet up with some friends.

29:16.672 --> 29:19.591
Hey, stop by later. 245 Bay Avenue.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.468
If you want. It's in Bushwick.

29:23.971 --> 29:24.805
Fuck!

29:24.888 --> 29:27.266
Okay, so, my ticket connect has gone dark,

29:27.349 --> 29:29.559
but I was able to track down
Bernard the intern.

29:29.643 --> 29:31.019
Alicia fucking left.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.854
Man, fuck that noise. Look...

29:33.105 --> 29:35.399
we got more important things
to worry about tonight, okay?

29:35.482 --> 29:37.877
I didn't wanna tell you,
because I didn't wanna freak you out

29:37.901 --> 29:39.701
and I knew you wouldn't come otherwise,
but...

29:39.778 --> 29:41.905
Rahmel is backstage
and he is ready to sign you.

29:41.989 --> 29:44.324
- Shut up.
- Dude, read the email for yourself.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.413
This is just directions
to fucking Will Call.

29:50.247 --> 29:55.419
It literally says, "Might be able to get
OH! A minute or two with Rahmel",

29:55.502 --> 29:57.546
"but no promises." Smiley face?

29:57.629 --> 29:59.589
That smiley face right there is key.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.217
Owen, it's a foot in the door.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.928
Then all you have to do
is spit a fire verse for Rahmel,

30:05.012 --> 30:08.890
not projectile vomit on anyone,
and boom, we got ourselves a record deal.

30:08.974 --> 30:11.435
So, you just lied and Rahmel
is not here to sign us.

30:11.518 --> 30:12.561
Rahmel is here.

30:12.769 --> 30:15.981
And he could sign us if you just nut up
and stick to my plan.

30:16.398 --> 30:17.566
I love your hustle.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.068
- You're one of my best friends, right?
- "One of"?

30:20.652 --> 30:22.738
But understand something. It's over.

30:23.447 --> 30:24.447
It's over.

30:26.867 --> 30:28.076
Bro, where you going?

30:28.243 --> 30:29.953
To Brooklyn to find Alicia.

30:30.704 --> 30:32.331
Alicia has a new boyfriend.

30:32.914 --> 30:33.999
Lie number two tonight.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.460
I'm sorry! Okay?

30:36.918 --> 30:39.421
But I just don't wanna see you
waste your last night.

30:39.588 --> 30:42.674
I would rather waste my last night
trying to get with your sister

30:42.758 --> 30:47.179
than rapping for some exec who's never
gonna give Seezjah Boy a fucking deal.

31:15.457 --> 31:16.457
Owen!

31:16.958 --> 31:18.919
- You actually came.
- I did.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.463
Well, here you go, babe.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.340
Small-batch whiskey,

31:23.423 --> 31:29.179
artisanal bitters,
and I muddled the ginger just for you.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.181
- Okay?
- Yeah.

31:31.515 --> 31:32.682
Owen, this is Brooklyn.

31:33.350 --> 31:36.269
Yeah. No, I know where we're at.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.064
No, my name is Brooklyn.

31:39.648 --> 31:42.317
Oh, like you're named after
like David Beckham's son?

31:44.236 --> 31:47.322
No, I'm much older than that.
Who is this guy?

31:47.614 --> 31:49.574
This is my little brother's best friend

31:49.658 --> 31:51.818
and he's actually shipping off
to the Marines tomorrow.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.913
Sick! I am so jealous.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.625
My entire festival wardrobe
is military inspired.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.002
Babe, what is my favorite textile?

32:01.086 --> 32:02.671
- I do not know.
- It's camo.

32:03.588 --> 32:04.588
Sick.

32:09.761 --> 32:13.306
Here you go,
three VIP all-access badges for you.

32:13.390 --> 32:16.309
Bro, thank you so much.
I owe you big time for this.

32:16.393 --> 32:17.978
Anything you need, I got you.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.647
Yo. No problem, man.
That Seezjah Boy shit ain't right.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.167
Anything I can do to help OH! Bounce back,
you know I got you.

32:23.191 --> 32:24.192
Awesome. My guy.

32:24.693 --> 32:27.237
Yo. I should probably get off though,
I gotta go get him.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.948
Actually, can I ask you something?

32:30.449 --> 32:31.575
Anything. Shoot.

32:31.658 --> 32:32.701
Let me rock your watch.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.620
What? No, really?

32:35.996 --> 32:37.756
You like this watch?
It ain't even that dope.

32:37.831 --> 32:40.917
"What? Really? You like this...?"
Nigga, it's a gold Rolex.

32:41.001 --> 32:42.586
Everyone likes that watch, okay?

32:42.669 --> 32:45.069
I'm trying to go flex on these groupies
in here, man. Please.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.970
Help a guy out. I'm a unpaid intern
and that's a French Montana concert.

32:48.008 --> 32:51.136
All right. I was thinking more like
a reference for your next job,

32:51.219 --> 32:53.221
but here you go. Here's a Rolex.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.894
Shit, you know what time it is?

32:59.352 --> 33:01.021
Time for me to get my dick sucked.

33:01.938 --> 33:02.772
Tight.

33:02.856 --> 33:05.025
Hey, did you leave food in here
or something?

33:05.108 --> 33:06.776
What? No.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.778
These seats are mad sticky, bro.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.908
Anyway, I'll see you in there, bro.

33:13.867 --> 33:16.411
- See ya.
- Rahmel's about to pull up right now, man.

33:16.495 --> 33:17.704
Just sat in semen.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.248
The nectar of the gods.

33:20.582 --> 33:24.628
Fruit-forward, full-bodied,
with a very strong tone.

33:24.711 --> 33:27.631
Probably from the South of France,
I was thinking Northern Califor...

33:27.714 --> 33:28.924
God damn it!

33:29.007 --> 33:31.426
Oh, my bad, bro. Are you okay?

33:31.510 --> 33:32.886
No, I'm not okay.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.931
This outfit is Saint Laurent, bro.

33:36.181 --> 33:38.350
- It'll come out.
- No, it won't.

33:38.433 --> 33:39.559
God.

33:39.851 --> 33:43.230
I haven't even had a chance
to post my OOTD to my IG yet.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.774
We all know this is a hundred-liker.

33:46.983 --> 33:47.983
Fuck!

33:49.819 --> 33:54.699
So, that's your type, like, metrosexual
pressed-juice type of niggas?

33:54.783 --> 33:56.952
Oh, no, he's just really into fashion.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.162
I don't know if he's metrosexual.

33:59.788 --> 34:02.290
At least he doesn't wear those ridiculous
billowing scarves.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.334
Right. Right, yeah.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.547
Should we get outta here?

34:10.340 --> 34:11.340
What?

34:11.550 --> 34:12.634
Do you wanna go?

34:13.426 --> 34:15.387
- With you?
- Yes.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.139
What could be more French New Wave

34:18.223 --> 34:22.643
than making a frantic exit
with a mysterious younger man?

34:22.811 --> 34:25.563
But you're not mysterious.
I've known you half your life.

34:25.647 --> 34:28.065
Yes, as your little brother's
little friend.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.275
Okay, I get it.

34:29.442 --> 34:32.612
But there's a whole lot about me
you don't know,

34:32.779 --> 34:35.407
a whole mysterious side
just waiting for you.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.158
Drunk Owen is romantic.

34:37.659 --> 34:43.415
Imagine us, okay, sharing an ice cold
40-ounce of premium malt liquor,

34:43.498 --> 34:48.085
talking about life as we watch the sunrise
from a Williamsburg rooftop?

34:48.712 --> 34:50.547
Right? Come on.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.510
Can we get salt and vinegar chips
to go with the 40s?

34:55.594 --> 34:58.305
Yes. Fuck, yes. Yes, we can.

34:58.388 --> 35:01.891
And if you have a valid ID,
the chips and the 40s is on me.

35:01.975 --> 35:02.975
Baller alert.

35:03.059 --> 35:04.769
Say goodbye to Brooklyn and let's go.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.273
You're sweet.

35:10.942 --> 35:14.654
- Okay, just don't say "but" after that.
- Okay.

35:14.738 --> 35:16.031
- I won't say "but."
- All right.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.991
However, I should go check on him.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.163
- You smell like burritos.
- Yeah, sorry about that.

35:23.246 --> 35:26.082
Don't be. If I could only have one food
for the rest of my life,

35:26.166 --> 35:28.293
it would be Chip O'Lee's
bean and cheese burritos.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.670
And you're telling me this isn't destiny?

35:30.754 --> 35:33.757
And by the way,
as the heir to the Chip O'Lee's empire,

35:33.840 --> 35:37.177
fucking with me guarantees you
free guacamole for like life.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.762
- Hmm..
- Wow.

35:38.970 --> 35:42.682
Are you really still using that pathetic
"unlimited guacamole" pick-up line?

35:43.141 --> 35:46.895
- 'Cause I got something way doper.
- Oh, shit. You actually got 'em.

35:47.604 --> 35:49.147
<i>Claro que si</i> I got them.

35:49.230 --> 35:50.607
I keep it 100. Okay?

35:50.690 --> 35:52.817
The kid always comes through
in the clutch.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.653
The kid rarely comes through
in the clutch.

35:54.736 --> 35:57.506
She's got a point. The kid basically
never comes through in the clutch.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.970
Okay. Well, here I am,
coming through in the clutch right now.

36:00.033 --> 36:02.786
Now, are we outtie or do you wanna
partake in the vegan orgy,

36:02.869 --> 36:05.080
- which is about to happen?
- Babe?

36:07.082 --> 36:09.417
Got the jeans and the shirt
soaking in Woolite,

36:09.501 --> 36:12.837
but can you please help me get
the red wine out of my vintage trainers?

36:13.421 --> 36:14.547
I'm literally freaking out.

36:14.964 --> 36:15.964
Fuck.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.437
So, just to be clear,
I'm not spitting for anybody,

36:29.521 --> 36:32.232
I'm strictly here to listen to music
and try and fuck your sister.

36:32.357 --> 36:35.360
- I know. That came out wrong.
- Okay, I will let that comment slide

36:35.443 --> 36:37.838
if you promise to at least talk to Rahmel
backstage. Come on!

36:37.862 --> 36:39.864
Hey! Is that Seezjah Boy?

36:42.659 --> 36:43.535
What did you say?

36:43.618 --> 36:45.578
I said, is that Seezjah Boy?

36:45.662 --> 36:48.123
Okay. That name's not nice.

36:48.248 --> 36:50.917
It's actually very offensive.
You should apologize to my friend.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.586
Come on, don't be a bitch.
It's hilarious.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.797
You wanna see something hilarious?

36:56.881 --> 36:59.676
You're being an asshole
and wearing wrinkle-free khakis.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.839
You can't be an asshole
and wear wrinkle-free khakis.

37:02.470 --> 37:06.349
Roasted. Savage.
Yo, maybe you should join the Marines.

37:09.352 --> 37:12.564
<i>- Let's kill this show. C'mon.</i>
- Shit, I think this is the last song.

37:12.647 --> 37:15.024
Guys, trust me.
View will be way better backstage.

37:15.108 --> 37:16.317
- You ready?
- No, it won't!

37:16.401 --> 37:18.778
You can't see anything backstage.
Everybody knows that!

37:18.862 --> 37:22.073
What does your basic ass know
about being backstage, Alicia?

37:22.157 --> 37:26.077
I know that if I'm backstage, I can't see
what's happening on stage, you dummy.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.914
Oh, shit. That's actually incredibly
valid. Fuck.

37:30.623 --> 37:31.624
Fuck!

37:33.209 --> 37:34.377
Fuck!

37:36.004 --> 37:38.298
Excuse me! My bad. I'm sorry.

37:38.381 --> 37:40.633
- All the way in the front!
- Okay.

37:52.187 --> 37:54.731
You got five minutes,
then we're going backstage. Cool?

37:54.814 --> 37:55.982
- Cool.
- Good.

37:58.902 --> 38:00.528
Yo! What's up, girl?

38:00.612 --> 38:02.071
You ever fucks with white boys?

38:03.531 --> 38:05.033
Nobody fucks with white boys.

38:05.116 --> 38:08.870
Y'all are culturally washed.
But you had a good run. We enjoyed that.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.080
<i>Y'all having a good time tonight?</i>

38:13.958 --> 38:17.629
<i>New York City, a lot of sexy ladies
in the building at one time.</i>

38:18.338 --> 38:21.216
<i>Gonna need to borrow one of ya'll tonight.
Is that cool?</i>

38:23.635 --> 38:25.970
<i>Hold on. I see somebody I like.</i>

38:27.514 --> 38:29.057
<i>Right there.</i>

38:30.350 --> 38:31.643
<i>Come up here, baby.</i>

38:32.018 --> 38:34.103
<i>Come up here and let's have
an unforgettable night.</i>

38:34.187 --> 38:36.272
<i>I need you to help me sing
this last song tonight.</i>

38:36.356 --> 38:37.524
I'll be right back!

38:40.485 --> 38:41.694

38:41.778 --> 38:44.239
<i>Can I get her a hand?</i>

- So, now you wanna go backstage.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.088
Yeah.

40:25.381 --> 40:27.133
Excuse me. Pardon me, please.

40:27.216 --> 40:29.761
- Shit. Where is she?
- Bro, I'm gonna level here.

40:29.844 --> 40:33.139
Probably giving French's penis a deep
tissue massage in the back of a Maybach.

40:33.431 --> 40:37.268
That's how I know you're a fucking virgin,
because that... that just sounds painful.

40:39.020 --> 40:40.271
Good God.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.025
How insane was that?

40:45.068 --> 40:47.487
I just got objectified by a rapper
and I loved it.

40:47.570 --> 40:50.281
Hello, moodles. How we doing this evening?

40:50.365 --> 40:54.869
Great. Allow me to introduce you to
the soon-to-be world famous rapper OH!

40:54.953 --> 40:57.413
We're here tonight to sign
a major record deal.

40:57.497 --> 41:00.833
Honey, if you play your cards right,
maybe you'll be in our next music video

41:00.917 --> 41:03.503
in the role of
bikini-clad thot number one.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.296
You like getting showered in Moët?

41:05.630 --> 41:07.048
You haven't changed a bit.

41:09.676 --> 41:11.052
Do I know you or something?

41:11.135 --> 41:14.681
It's Amanda Paulson
from Camp Shalom, Israel.

41:15.348 --> 41:16.724
Oh, my God.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.394
She just did a photo shoot
with French for <i>Vogue.</i>

41:19.477 --> 41:22.939
Amanda Paulson aka "Pizza Face" Paulson?

41:23.231 --> 41:25.024
Wait, Pizza Face, is that you?

41:25.650 --> 41:26.901
Wow.

41:27.151 --> 41:31.239
I'm sorry for making everyone at that camp
call you that insidious nickname.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.658
I apologize. It's my bad.

41:33.908 --> 41:36.327
Keep it. I've moved on.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.081
- I think I'm gonna go find Rahmel.
- Yeah.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.164
Get in there.

41:45.044 --> 41:47.463
So, okay, everybody's leaving.

41:47.547 --> 41:49.215
- Babe, are you coming?
- Yes.

41:49.799 --> 41:50.799
Where you guys going?

41:50.842 --> 41:53.123
We're just going to
to the after party at the Dream Hotel.

41:53.469 --> 41:54.554
Do you wanna come?

42:03.187 --> 42:04.187
Oh, shit.

42:05.523 --> 42:08.317
Actually, it's probably better
if I sit on your lap, Owen.

42:08.776 --> 42:09.776
All right.

42:12.905 --> 42:13.948
Okay.

42:16.325 --> 42:17.785
What is that on your lap?

42:18.911 --> 42:19.911
It's me.

42:22.248 --> 42:23.248
Let's go!

42:23.833 --> 42:25.168
Wait, stop the car, please.

42:25.918 --> 42:27.211
I can't leave Jeff.

42:27.628 --> 42:30.381
- Seriously? Everyone else does.
- I know.

42:31.007 --> 42:32.467
Are you serious? Look at that.

42:34.594 --> 42:35.595
Really?

42:37.722 --> 42:38.806
We'll meet you there.

42:40.058 --> 42:41.058
You better.

42:42.518 --> 42:45.688
Jessica. Oh, my God, hi.
It is so good to hear your voice.

42:45.772 --> 42:47.023
I am so sorry about the delay,

42:47.106 --> 42:49.666
but my phone is literally on three percent
and it's about to die.

42:49.734 --> 42:52.153
I am here backstage,
but I cannot see Rahmel anywhere.

42:52.236 --> 42:53.863
He's not here. Do you have any idea?

42:53.946 --> 42:57.116
<i>Probably because Rahmel's gone.
He went to the after party.</i>

42:57.867 --> 43:00.286
Fuck!

43:00.912 --> 43:02.413
So, sorry about that.

43:02.497 --> 43:06.042
Like I said, my phone is about to die
and where is said after party?

43:06.125 --> 43:08.336
We can go. Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

43:08.419 --> 43:11.839
Nobody's ever flaked on me before when
I was getting them in front of Rahmel.

43:11.923 --> 43:14.592
Jessica, for the love of God!
I am begging you!

43:14.675 --> 43:17.303
Just tell me where the after party is,
okay?

43:17.386 --> 43:18.930
Jessica? Hello?

43:21.307 --> 43:22.307
Fuck!

43:27.522 --> 43:31.609
Can somebody please tell me where
the motherfucking after party is?

43:32.276 --> 43:34.737
At the Dream Hotel. Why?

43:35.863 --> 43:38.491
Okay, I'm gonna disregard that
the only reason you know that

43:38.574 --> 43:41.661
is because you're trying to bang my sister
and just say... let's go.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.831
What you mean "trying to"?
Nigga, you know I'm gonna bang that.

43:58.636 --> 43:59.846
Room for two more?

44:01.806 --> 44:04.475
So... how you guys doing?

44:06.602 --> 44:07.645
Where you from?

44:08.896 --> 44:09.896
The Ukraine?

44:13.151 --> 44:14.151
Poland?

44:15.903 --> 44:16.903
Finland?

44:18.197 --> 44:20.032
- Caucasia?
- Estonia?

44:21.159 --> 44:22.660
- The North Pole.
- Latvia.

44:23.411 --> 44:25.204
The Republic of Tall White People?

44:27.290 --> 44:28.291
Jersey.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.210
- Oh, really?
- Jersey?

44:31.294 --> 44:33.671
All right, come on.
Out of the way, uglies.

44:33.880 --> 44:35.464
We got supermodels coming through.

44:35.548 --> 44:38.509
All right, there we go.
Good stuff. Get out the way.

44:38.593 --> 44:41.179
Nice, ladies. Nice.

44:41.512 --> 44:42.513
Beautiful.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.099
Where the hell y'all going?

44:45.183 --> 44:46.183
What do you mean?

44:46.309 --> 44:48.629
- I mean, clearly, we're with them.
- You're not with them.

44:49.979 --> 44:50.979
Fine.

44:51.022 --> 44:54.942
Yours truly Jeff Levine
here with my artist OH!, the lyrical god.

44:56.444 --> 44:57.778
Nah, don't see it.

44:57.862 --> 45:00.448
What do you mean "Nah, don't see it"?

45:00.907 --> 45:03.826
We're personal friends of Rahmel Lloyd.
Check his list.

45:03.910 --> 45:07.538
I don't know no Rahmel Lalloy
and he ain't got no list.

45:07.622 --> 45:11.375
His name is Rahmel Lloyd,
and he certainly does have a list.

45:11.459 --> 45:12.668
Come on, don't be an...

45:12.752 --> 45:14.587
Don't get your ass slapped, Peter Pan.

45:14.670 --> 45:16.255
I'm sorry about my friend, okay?

45:16.839 --> 45:19.967
It's just there's a girl in there
I've been trying talk to my whole life,

45:20.635 --> 45:24.305
and tonight, for the first time, it feels
like I might actually have a shot.

45:25.223 --> 45:28.643
Now, can you just like
have a heart and let us in?

45:30.228 --> 45:32.980
You want me to have a heart
for a motherfucker

45:33.064 --> 45:35.441
who been chasing the same bitch
his whole life,

45:35.524 --> 45:36.901
throughout his whole existence?

45:37.485 --> 45:39.445
Let me tell you and Peter Pan
something both.

45:39.528 --> 45:43.324
If y'all wanna get in here,
how about you come back rich,

45:43.532 --> 45:44.825
you come back famous,

45:44.909 --> 45:47.620
or y'all come back
with a whole lot of bitches.

45:47.912 --> 45:49.497
Or don't come back at all.

45:50.957 --> 45:53.167
- Oh, hell no!
- What?

45:53.376 --> 45:55.503
You said bitches. We got bitches.

45:55.586 --> 45:58.422
Yeah. But I didn't say go get the bitches
off <i>Sesame Street.</i>

45:58.506 --> 46:01.676
Look at these bitches.
These bitches look young as hell.

46:01.801 --> 46:04.428
And look at the bitch in the back,
she got braces.

46:04.553 --> 46:06.681
Where the hell you get these bitches from?

46:08.140 --> 46:09.809
Bat mitzvah, third floor.

46:10.851 --> 46:12.645
Can you guys get us coke or not?

46:24.198 --> 46:27.034
The one god damn night
I don't bring my Supreme Money Gun.

46:27.118 --> 46:29.078
Jesus. Do you smell that?

46:30.913 --> 46:33.708
Bro, this is what I imagine heaven's like.

46:34.292 --> 46:36.502
Except maybe minus
all the scary dudes with boners.

46:38.337 --> 46:40.798
This ain't heaven, little nigga.
It's hell.

46:41.424 --> 46:42.758
You ain't built for this shit.

46:42.967 --> 46:44.760
You are absolutely right, sir.

46:45.594 --> 46:46.971
The bitches will burn you.

46:47.680 --> 46:49.557
Like literally or figuratively?

46:49.640 --> 46:51.267
You'll find out when you take a piss.

46:52.393 --> 46:54.312
Appreciate that, thank you.

46:55.938 --> 46:58.441
Hand me half a stack. Just follow my lead.

46:58.524 --> 47:00.526
Want a dance in the VIP, pappy?

47:00.985 --> 47:04.238
Nah, I'm okay. I wanna get you outta here.

47:04.405 --> 47:07.325
Okay. That'll be 5,000 for the night.

47:07.908 --> 47:10.244
But, listen, I don't do anal.

47:11.287 --> 47:13.748
I'm trying to take you to a party in Soho.

47:14.165 --> 47:16.584
You know, no anal, you can just come.

47:16.667 --> 47:19.628
- Oh, so like a date?
- Yeah, like a date.

47:19.712 --> 47:23.090
I can't go on a date with you.
My boyfriend is too jealous for that.

47:24.425 --> 47:27.511
I promise you, it's the after party
to end all after parties.

47:27.595 --> 47:29.388
Now grab some friends and let's roll.

47:29.472 --> 47:31.307
Sounds too late for me.

47:31.557 --> 47:35.019
I got the bus leaving for my church picnic
early in the morning.

47:35.227 --> 47:37.188
Can't hit snooze on Jesus.

47:37.980 --> 47:41.275
<i>Yo, DJ Jus Ske in the mix-up this bitch.</i>

47:41.484 --> 47:43.110
<i>Put your motherfucking hands together</i>

47:43.194 --> 47:47.406
<i>for the hottest chick in the game,
Ms. Bl'Asia!</i>

49:00.020 --> 49:03.274
- Allow me to assist!
- Get your fucking hands off my money.

49:03.524 --> 49:06.777
Sorry. My name's Jeff Levine
of the Jeff Levine Company.

49:06.861 --> 49:08.737
We're a boutique artist management firm,

49:08.821 --> 49:11.574
currently operating out of my parents'
McMansion in Westchester.

49:11.657 --> 49:13.367
I already have representation.

49:13.742 --> 49:14.952
That's not what I'm asking.

49:16.245 --> 49:17.245
Wait, hold up.

49:17.538 --> 49:18.538
You have a manager?

49:18.581 --> 49:21.459
I make ten Gs in cash, on a slow night.

49:21.542 --> 49:24.336
You better believe I got a Jew
up in Midtown handling my shit.

49:26.130 --> 49:28.174
- Will you marry me?
- No.

49:29.049 --> 49:30.301
- Shit.
- Help me down.

49:30.509 --> 49:31.509
Of course.

49:34.388 --> 49:36.849
Listen, do you and your friends

49:36.932 --> 49:40.352
maybe wanna come with me and my friend
to the French Montana after party?

49:40.603 --> 49:42.313
That'll be $3,000 an hour.

49:42.771 --> 49:46.108
And that don't entitle you to shit,
but my company, so don't get it twisted.

49:46.192 --> 49:49.778
Yeah. I was thinking you guys
would maybe come more as our friends?

49:50.196 --> 49:52.990
Friends don't pay for my three condos.

49:53.073 --> 49:56.535
On top of my motherfucking Facebook stock
going down by 30% this week.

49:57.119 --> 49:59.914
Please, I'm begging you. My friend there,
see him by the bar?

49:59.997 --> 50:02.291
He ships out to the Marines tomorrow.

50:02.541 --> 50:04.877
His last dying wish
is to go to this party,

50:04.960 --> 50:06.754
but he needs you to get in. Please.

50:06.837 --> 50:08.380
It sucks to be your friend.

50:09.924 --> 50:11.967
Gonna pour some hot Hennessy
down your ass crack.

50:12.426 --> 50:15.596
Didn't I say to respect my motherfucking
workspace after we broke up?

50:15.679 --> 50:19.225
You gonna respect this dick, 'cause I'm
paying full freight for that shit tonight.

50:19.308 --> 50:21.936
Boy, you ain't paying
a motherfucking thing with that $100 bill

50:22.019 --> 50:23.604
and them five motherfucking singles.

50:23.687 --> 50:25.606
Move your broke ass outta my way.

50:26.732 --> 50:27.942
- Boy, get your...
- What?

50:28.025 --> 50:29.777
You fucking with this
string bean ass nigga?

50:29.860 --> 50:33.030
This string bean is taking me
to French Montana after party.

50:33.531 --> 50:34.698
And that nigga packing.

50:34.782 --> 50:35.991
Let's go, Chad.

50:36.242 --> 50:37.159
Let's go!

50:37.243 --> 50:39.912
My name's actually Jeff,
by the way, not Chad.

50:40.412 --> 50:43.874
But that's cool, you can call me Chad.
I actually feel like more of a Chad.

50:44.333 --> 50:45.709
We're actually parked this way.

50:45.793 --> 50:48.128
Oh, good for you.
But we're not coming to your party.

50:48.212 --> 50:50.589
What? No, Bl'Asia, come on. Please.

50:50.714 --> 50:53.842
Yo, one drink and I will personally
drive y'all home.

50:53.926 --> 50:55.686
Have you noticed Chad's car?
It's actually...

50:55.761 --> 50:56.761
Bl'Asia!

50:56.971 --> 50:59.098
- Yo! Got the gaup.
- Which way y'all parked?

50:59.265 --> 51:00.505
- Get back in the club!
- There.

51:00.558 --> 51:02.935
Good, 'cause this nigga's crazy.
He's been stalking me. Run!

51:03.018 --> 51:05.437
Fucking with this
Eddie Munster-looking ass nigga?

51:05.521 --> 51:06.522
Come on, let's go!

51:06.605 --> 51:09.149
- Run! Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

51:09.233 --> 51:11.026
- Come on!
- What the fuck?!

51:11.110 --> 51:12.361
Bl'Asia!

51:12.444 --> 51:13.612
Shit!

51:13.988 --> 51:15.489
Yo, put it the fuck in gear!

51:16.323 --> 51:19.034
You gonna let these goofy motherfuckers
rob the pussy?

51:19.577 --> 51:20.744
Go!

51:24.748 --> 51:25.748
Fuck!

51:26.625 --> 51:27.918
Hey, yo!

51:28.252 --> 51:29.670
God damn!

51:31.171 --> 51:33.007
That was pretty terrifying.

51:33.090 --> 51:36.051
- Fuck's wrong with that guy?
- I already told you, that nigga's crazy.

51:39.805 --> 51:41.015
Y'all hear something?

51:44.143 --> 51:45.936
Okay, what the fuck is going on?

51:46.020 --> 51:48.147
Oh, God, this nigga Leon.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.150
- Yo, go!
- Fuck!

51:54.528 --> 51:56.715
- Yo, make this light.
- I cannot fuck up this car, okay?

51:56.739 --> 51:58.157
My Dad loves it more than me.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.368
- Fuck the car, just make the light!
- Shit!

52:15.924 --> 52:17.468
Holy fuck.

52:18.636 --> 52:20.304
This nigga looks crazy.

52:33.359 --> 52:35.027
You broke my heart, Bl'Asia.

52:36.236 --> 52:39.907
Well, you got a funny way of showing it.
Cheating on me with your cousin?

52:40.491 --> 52:42.576
- What?
- So, what? You fucking Chad now?

52:43.118 --> 52:46.205
Fucking Chad from fucking Connecticut,
just to prove a fucking point?

52:46.288 --> 52:47.414
Nobody fucking Chad.

52:49.291 --> 52:52.002
Actually, I'm from Westchester,
not Connecticut.

52:52.086 --> 52:54.004
So, you know, I'm technically
a New Yorker too.

52:54.088 --> 52:56.524
'Cause it's like a ten-minute Uber
from my house with traffic.

52:56.548 --> 52:58.175
Get out the fucking car right now.

52:58.258 --> 52:59.938
Lemme see how much New York you are,
nigga.

52:59.968 --> 53:02.346
As tempting as that sounds,
I think I'm gonna pass.

53:04.765 --> 53:06.433
Oh, shit!

53:06.975 --> 53:10.020
Hey! Yo!
Yo, that's the Seezjah Boy, right?

53:10.646 --> 53:13.065
Yo! What up... Seezjah?!

53:13.148 --> 53:14.608
Run this nigga over right now.

53:16.902 --> 53:18.445
Yo, what the fuck, man?!

53:18.529 --> 53:21.448
Get out the fucking car, white boy.
I'm gonna fuck up your fancy car.

53:21.532 --> 53:23.409
- No!
- Oh, shit!

53:23.492 --> 53:25.035
Give me your phone right now.

53:26.370 --> 53:28.848
- Hello, officer. We're at 47th Avenue...
- Don't call the police!

53:28.872 --> 53:30.332
What the fuck?!

53:30.416 --> 53:33.144
- Snitches get stitches out here.
- Are you insane? Give me the phone!

53:33.168 --> 53:35.045
No, I have priors and a warrant.

53:35.129 --> 53:38.549
So, I suggest you go out there,
man up, and go fight Leon.

53:38.632 --> 53:40.801
- What?!
- So we can go to this party.

53:40.884 --> 53:43.404
You know, Leon, he talk a good game,
but can't fight worth shit.

53:43.429 --> 53:45.848
- So fight him so we can get to this party.
- No!

53:45.973 --> 53:48.225
When they go low, we go high. Okay?

53:48.308 --> 53:49.643
I'm not fighting Leon.

53:55.274 --> 53:56.734
- Oh, shit!
- Fuck, man!

53:56.817 --> 53:58.110
Damn!

53:58.527 --> 53:59.570
Yo, shit!

54:00.529 --> 54:02.614
- What the fuck?!
- I'm sorry!

54:02.698 --> 54:04.283
I've only had my license
for five months

54:04.366 --> 54:06.410
and I failed my first road test.
Reverse is a bitch.

54:06.493 --> 54:09.288
This guy got a fucking
basketball game tomorrow, man.

54:09.371 --> 54:10.371
Sorry?

54:10.873 --> 54:12.666
We was playing with you before, bro.

54:12.750 --> 54:15.377
- Now I'm really gonna have to fuck you up!
- Fuck me!

54:19.089 --> 54:20.549
You dead, kids!

54:31.435 --> 54:34.646
Hold up. <i>You </i> with the burrito boys?

54:34.730 --> 54:36.440
No, they're with me.

54:56.168 --> 54:59.046
Dude, when I find Rahmel,
you're gonna spit for him, right?

54:59.546 --> 55:01.924
No! I'm gonna go find Alicia.

55:02.007 --> 55:03.675
- Bro.
- Don't fuck this up for me.

55:04.927 --> 55:05.927
Fuck!

55:08.347 --> 55:09.347
I might.

55:09.723 --> 55:10.723
My guy!

55:15.270 --> 55:16.270
Yes.

55:16.313 --> 55:18.357
Still whack. Still bad.

55:19.525 --> 55:20.525
We're back.

55:34.581 --> 55:35.874
Look, can I ask a favor, please?

55:36.458 --> 55:37.793
What do you want, Chad?

55:38.252 --> 55:40.045
I'm still looking for Rahmel.

55:40.128 --> 55:42.673
I mean, it's ridiculous.
I can't find his ass anywhere.

55:42.756 --> 55:44.925
Well, have you tried
looking for his ass in VIP?

55:46.343 --> 55:48.554
There's an after-after party?

55:48.637 --> 55:51.390
Listen, no matter
how exclusive the party is,

55:51.473 --> 55:53.559
it's always gonna be another place
more exclusive.

55:53.642 --> 55:54.642
Shit!

55:54.977 --> 55:58.230
I mean, Jesus, can't people just relax
and have fun in one fucking place?

55:58.939 --> 55:59.939
This looks nice.

56:00.649 --> 56:01.649
God.

56:01.692 --> 56:05.195
Suite 734. I would personally go myself,

56:05.279 --> 56:08.198
but I heard Desiigner's there,
and I owe him some money.

56:08.282 --> 56:11.159
Fuck, man, I gotta get down there,
don't I? Shit.

56:12.160 --> 56:15.372
Why are you drinking Henny
when we both know your little Jewish ass

56:15.455 --> 56:17.124
really wants some vodka and cranberry?

56:17.207 --> 56:20.252
What? Don't be trippin', I love Henny.

56:20.502 --> 56:22.379
It's the nectar of the gods,
you know that.

56:25.424 --> 56:26.424
Delicious.

56:26.508 --> 56:28.260
You know what your problem is, Chad?

56:28.343 --> 56:30.846
You try way too hard to be something
that you're not,

56:30.929 --> 56:32.806
and it really comes across
as you being a dick.

56:32.890 --> 56:35.434
But if you actually tried
being yourself...

56:37.144 --> 56:39.062
you might even get a girl to fuck you.

56:43.775 --> 56:45.068
Ha.

56:47.237 --> 56:50.032
You don't mean like tonight, right?

56:51.950 --> 56:53.201
See? You're learning.

56:53.702 --> 56:55.662
And look at that smile,
that's a good smile.

56:55.746 --> 56:58.749
- What, this?
- Yes. I think if you smile more,

56:59.625 --> 57:01.376
people may actually treat you differently.

57:01.460 --> 57:03.378
Are you reacting to me differently
right now?

57:03.462 --> 57:05.797
- Maybe.
- I love you.

57:06.131 --> 57:07.131
I know, boo.

57:07.174 --> 57:09.593
You're the most amazing woman
I have ever met.

57:11.511 --> 57:14.181
Well, if I'm so amazing,
come see me at the club tomorrow.

57:14.264 --> 57:16.266
And bring your daddy's ATM card.

57:16.516 --> 57:18.143
And his Amex.

57:18.226 --> 57:21.521
And his Black Card. And everything else.

57:21.605 --> 57:23.482
I'm gonna Venmo the shit out of you, girl.

57:24.316 --> 57:25.316
Damn.

57:28.820 --> 57:29.820
Good to see you, sir.

57:34.451 --> 57:35.535
Don't say shit.

57:36.203 --> 57:37.496
Okay, yeah.

57:37.579 --> 57:40.540
Rahmel is definitely here,
I can feel it in my dick.

57:41.249 --> 57:43.794
DJ Khaled!

57:43.877 --> 57:46.421
Bro, you gotta chill, man, chill.
I'm on the low, man.

57:46.505 --> 57:47.965
- Bless up!
- Bless up.

57:48.173 --> 57:49.341
Wise up!

57:49.508 --> 57:50.508
Totally.

57:59.434 --> 58:00.352
Hey, Amanda.

58:00.435 --> 58:01.435
Where's Alicia?

58:01.979 --> 58:03.897
She was looking for your ass all night.

58:04.189 --> 58:05.315
Tee Grizzley?

58:05.983 --> 58:09.820
Grizz Nasty and I were just exchanging
stories about our troubled childhoods.

58:10.070 --> 58:14.616
He was arrested at 19 for selling drugs,
and I had cystic acne.

58:15.993 --> 58:17.661
Amanda know about that struggle.

58:19.454 --> 58:20.789
So, where's Alicia?

58:20.872 --> 58:24.042
She was looking for you all night, man,
but now you may be too late.

58:24.126 --> 58:25.877
What do you mean too late?
I just got here.

58:25.961 --> 58:27.963
She had a lot to drink, like a lot.

58:28.422 --> 58:29.965
Ain't gonna lie, home-girl fucked up.

58:30.340 --> 58:32.592
Fuck. Okay, where'd you guys
see her at last?

58:33.719 --> 58:35.846
Heading to the bar with some big bald guy.

58:36.304 --> 58:38.765
- Shit! Fuck.
- Good luck with that.

58:40.434 --> 58:42.185
Can I tell you a secret?

58:42.394 --> 58:47.024
No one's ever made me feel like so small,
but still really strong.

58:49.359 --> 58:50.527
Bye.

58:56.283 --> 58:59.202
Jessica! Hi.
I've been looking all over for you.

58:59.494 --> 59:00.954
She's spoken for, man. Come on.

59:01.663 --> 59:02.998
This is my favorite video.

59:04.332 --> 59:06.752
Sorry, Mr. Desiigner,
but this is very important.

59:07.210 --> 59:09.421
Jessica, where's Rahmel? I have Owen.

59:09.504 --> 59:12.174
Did you just take my phone? I should
get up and run at your mouth.

59:12.257 --> 59:13.425
I'm so sorry. Here.

59:14.009 --> 59:15.719
But dude, are you watching otter videos?

59:15.802 --> 59:19.222
Yeah, I love otter videos.
They're nature's little magicians.

59:19.681 --> 59:21.561
You got a problem with me
watching otter videos?

59:21.641 --> 59:23.560
No, not at all. I like otters.

59:23.643 --> 59:25.520
You're too late, Jeff. Rahmel's gone.

59:26.396 --> 59:28.523
What do you mean, he's gone? Where is he?

59:28.607 --> 59:29.816
He went home.

59:29.900 --> 59:31.026
You blew it.

59:31.985 --> 59:32.986
Let it go.

59:34.654 --> 59:36.656
Hey, it's the one where they eat lettuce.

59:39.618 --> 59:40.869
Oh, he's gonna do it. Do it!

59:55.092 --> 59:56.176
Is he gonna blink?

59:56.968 --> 59:58.136
He ain't moved yet.

59:58.553 --> 01:00:00.555
We outta here. He's trippin', man.

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:18.782
Rahmel's gone, man.

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:21.660
We were too late.

01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:25.247
This night's a fucking disaster.

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:27.706
Let's go.

01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:32.462
You know, you were so obsessed with
following my sister around tonight,

01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:35.006
that you blew our last chance
of achieving our dream.

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:37.843
Am I fucking hearing things?

01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:41.179
You blew our last chance when
you made me smoke Khalifa kush,

01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:43.473
so we could get some stoner
Instagram followers.

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:45.016
We're not stoners, Jeff.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:46.893
But that's your fucking problem,

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:48.895
you're always trying
to be something you're not.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:51.749
So, it's my fault that you let one
little setback turn you into a pussy

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:55.569
who's so afraid to spit that you're
enlisting in the fucking Marines tomorrow.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.488
Okay, it was, you know,
more than one little setback.

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:00.824
And, nigga,
nobody's afraid to do anything.

01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:02.492
Yeah, you are, Owen.

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:04.202
You're afraid, man, face it.

01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:08.331
God, I can't believe I thought
you were the real deal.

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:10.333
Turns out, you're just
a scared little bitch.

01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:14.337
I'm a bitch?

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:16.173
You fucking heard me.

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:19.926

Damn!

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:35.502
Owen, I was just trying to help you.

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:38.463
But you know what?
Fuck off and go be a Marine.

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:42.759
I'll find another rapper to make famous
in like two seconds.

01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:46.096
Sure, you do that.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:02.112
Fuck this.

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:20.216
Hey, man, thanks for letting me
rock your Rolly,

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.299
but it's kinda useless on me.

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.634
Oh, really? What happened?

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:26.928
Bombed out miserably.

01:03:27.012 --> 01:03:28.346
Rough night all around, huh?

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:31.975
I'm starting to think these chicks aren't
as materialistic as they make 'em seem.

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:35.603
Like, maybe instead flexing on 'em
with jewelry and, you know, clothes,

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:38.606
I could actually just walk up to one
and have a actual conversation

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:40.233
and just be like, "Hey, I'm Bernard."

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:43.278
I'm an unpaid intern who currently lives
in Bed-Stuy with his mom,

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:46.531
but I got a Costco membership,
so that fridge stays popping.

01:03:46.614 --> 01:03:49.576
And so, if you wanna come over
and drink coconut water and fuck,

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:51.911
- "I'm the guy to do it..."
- Oh, shit!

01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:55.707
That's my timepiece now, cracker.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:57.334
Yo. C'mon, man, give that back.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:58.752
Where Bl'Asia?

01:03:58.835 --> 01:03:59.836
She went home.

01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:01.504
Fucking bitch.

01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:05.759
Look, I'm sorry, but can you please
give that back to me, I really need it.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:07.344
It's my motherfucking clock now.

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:11.389
Look, Leon, you know what?

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:14.392
Honestly, I've had a real shitty night.
Okay?

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:18.229
So if you could do me a favor and fuck off
for a second, that'd be much appreciated.

01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:22.067
You know who had a fucking shitty night?
My man Stanley.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:25.195
Because you almost
got a fucking vehicular manslaughter.

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:29.157
So, nah, I can't fuck off.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.034
Oww.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:33.912
Look, Leon, come on, man,
everyone here knows you can kick my ass.

01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:35.675
We really have to waste time proving that?

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.292
You talk too fucking much.
Shut the fuck up!

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:42.438
My dad will pay for your boy's
medical bill. We have great insurance.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:44.297
But nobody here wants to see me fight you.

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:48.301
Fight! Fight!

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:51.388
- I'm gonna let you hit me first.
- What?

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:53.390
Fucking Opie motherfucker.

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:57.310
Right here.
I've been chewing on the box.

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:59.270
Yeah, you're gonna have to
knock this dude out.

01:04:59.354 --> 01:05:00.522
I can't do that!

01:05:01.106 --> 01:05:03.858
- Yes, you can!
- Gonna count to motherfuckin' three!

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:06.151
One!

01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:13.159
Leon a big pussy. Talking all that shit,
can't take a punch by a white boy.

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:15.537
Shit, man. You okay?

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:18.039
I've been taking boxing lessons
with my mother's trainer.

01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:19.666
He's been working my right hook hella.

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:21.668
Oh, shit.

01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:25.422
Fuck you, fat-ass nigga.

01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:29.884
Official Harlem, nigga.

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:31.845
Real-ass nigga!

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:36.516
- I can't breathe!
- Motherfucker!

01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:41.104
- Owen!
- Seezjah Boy knocked that nigga out!

01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:43.022
- You are my best friend.
- I love you!

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:47.193
A Seezjah Boy bonus! Oh, and he can spit!

01:05:51.406 --> 01:05:52.574
Owen! No, Owen!

01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:55.325
Jesus!

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:58.538
'Sup, 'sup?

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:04.918
Owen, no!

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:20.268
Bl'Asia.

01:06:23.938 --> 01:06:25.064
Bl'Asia?

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.148
Owen?

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:35.992
Where the fuck are you, dude?

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:38.286
- You hear a shot...
- Excuse me, officer.

01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:39.913
You see a young African-American teen?

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:42.725
About yay high, wearing black jeans
and Jordan 1 Shattered Backboards?

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:43.833
Yeah, about 30 of them.

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:46.044
- Fuck the police.
- What was that?

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:47.587
What? Nothing!

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:50.340
Owen!

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:52.175
Yo, Jeff.

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:54.135
- Yo.
- I'm taking off, man.

01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:57.013
I'm fucked up. I think somebody
stepped on my Yeezys in there.

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:58.515
- Shit, is that a Mophie?
- Yeah.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:01.476
- My phone's been dead since midnight.
- Here man, take it.

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:02.644
Thank you so much.

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:04.020
You're my savior, bro.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:05.703
- All right. Cool, man.
- All right, man.

01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:08.441
- Tell OH! I said goodnight, bro.
- I will. Thank you. Owen!

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:13.196
Fuck. Yo, you guys seen Seezjah Boy,
by any chance?

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:35.510
Oh, my God.

01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:37.762
You're alive.

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:41.432
- Ow.
- Sorry.

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:44.477
Dude, how did you know
to come back for me in there?

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:46.603
I had to piss.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.483
I feel like in the future,
when we like re-tell this story,

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.628
you say you felt some ninja sixth sense
type of shit,

01:07:52.652 --> 01:07:54.487
and just knew your best friend
was in danger.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.614
I'm sorry about that verse.

01:07:57.949 --> 01:08:01.869
You know, that's the first time I've spit
since the whole Seezjah Boy thing.

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:04.330
Man, that was fucking incredible, dude,

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:08.626
even though it literally took
a steaming shit on my entire existence.

01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:14.257
You know, what if I made a mistake, bro?

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.470
What if I'm not ready
to be a fucking Marine?

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:22.807
Are you asking me or are you telling me?

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.812
How do we get a record deal
before the sun rises?

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:33.192
My fucking guy. That's the smile.
Get in the fucking car.

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:35.319
- Let's go.
- You got a plan though, or...

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:38.203
'Course I have a fucking plan.
I have a plan and a half. I'm a manager.

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:39.282
Got plans up my ass.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:47.290
Bernard, I owe you big time.

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:50.792
I owe you like 9,000 blow jobs
for giving us his address.

01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:53.421
No, Bernard,
clearly not 9,000 blow jobs from me,

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:56.633

Dude, that went so differently in my head.

01:11:34.499 --> 01:11:35.499
Fuck that.

01:11:37.502 --> 01:11:39.712
- Bro, where you going?
- To climb the fire escape.

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:41.088
You said the third floor, right?

01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:42.892
Okay, I can't tell
if you're kidding or not.

01:11:43.674 --> 01:11:47.595
I'm a fucking Marine tomorrow, okay?
It's now or never.

01:11:58.064 --> 01:12:00.858
Yo. Remember when you asked me
if something was missing?

01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:04.987
- Yeah.
- Well, it wasn't your talent, bro.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:06.948
It was your confidence.

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:11.327
But it is here now, my friend,
in the most undeniable way.

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:12.786
Thanks.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:15.539
Okay, dude.

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:22.046
Listen to me, all that stands between you
and a record deal is literally...

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:00.751
Why are we at Juice Press?

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:04.672
Remember what it was before a Juice Press?

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:09.093
Fat Beats record store.

01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:14.265
Damn, dude,
we thought we were so gangster

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:17.018
coming into the city
just to go to this place.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.980
You used to come in here really rocking
your mom's gold chains

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:24.025
and your sister's leather fucking pants.

01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:25.609
Yep.

01:13:26.193 --> 01:13:29.155
My... My Kanye 2011 phase.

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:31.782
I actually got a lot of compliments
on that look.

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:33.075
I should bring it back.

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:39.498
Yo, if I haven't told you this,
you have been an awesome fucking manager.

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:44.712
Why "been"?

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:47.131
Because, bro,
this is where the dream started.

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:49.717
It's where we gotta say goodbye to it.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:53.179
Please don't cry on me, bro.

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:54.430
It's pepper spray.

01:13:55.014 --> 01:13:58.184
No, it's not, there's moisture.

01:13:59.477 --> 01:14:00.477
And you're crying.

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:10.446
What if everyone at Harvard just fucking
hates me like they did in high school?

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:12.907
No, everyone in high school
didn't hate you.

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:18.996
Okay, a lot of people... the vast majority
of people in high school hated you.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.623
Everyone hated me.

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:25.294
But look, underneath this dickish exterior
and fucking Gucci everything,

01:14:25.753 --> 01:14:27.546
you honestly have a heart of gold.

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:32.634
Shit.

01:14:35.513 --> 01:14:36.514
It's my sister.

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:46.232
I see what you did there.

01:14:48.275 --> 01:14:51.112
Hey, boys.
Oh, my God, what happened to you two?

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:53.906
Just a little scrap, it's nothing serious.

01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:57.201
This is Carlos, Max's boyfriend.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:02.832
Boyfriend is a strong word.
I would say we're hanging out.

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:04.458
Actually...

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:07.545
- he's obsessed with me.
- Okay, let's just eat.

01:15:08.546 --> 01:15:09.588
Awkward.

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:12.550
That's fucking awesome.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:15.886
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:20.266
You sell me on this magical
rooftop sunrise

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.809
and then you disappear on me?

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:25.646
- Is that your game?
- Wait, what? No.

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:30.317
Besides, the night's not even over.
We could still go for it.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:33.194
Night's over.

01:15:40.411 --> 01:15:41.954
When will I see you again?

01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:43.956
Honestly, I don't even know.

01:15:46.584 --> 01:15:47.793
Let's make a pact then.

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.257
The next time we see each other,
we're gonna get those ice cold 40s,

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.468
salt and vinegar chips,
and watch the sunrise.

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:56.718
Yes.

01:15:57.136 --> 01:15:58.846
And then fuck like animals.

01:16:02.349 --> 01:16:03.559
No, I'm just kidding.

01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:06.020
I can't have 40s, can you sub rosé?

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:12.358
Good.

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:19.408
Both getting in the back again. Nice.

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:10.835
I'm so sorry I didn't call last night.

01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:12.753
The night just sort of like...

01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:15.089
ran away from me.

01:17:15.673 --> 01:17:17.925
The hell happened to your daddy's car,
Jeffrey?

01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:22.096
Just one in a sea of disappointments my
father's had to endure having me as a son.

01:17:22.179 --> 01:17:24.265
I fucked up my dad's Impala
when I was your age.

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:26.892
Didn't make me a disappointment,
just made me a pain in the ass.

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:28.602
Like all children, including my own son.

01:17:30.104 --> 01:17:31.981
Speaking of, we ship out in 15 minutes.

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:33.357
Okay, thanks, Dad.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.568
Don't thank me.
I should make you drive first shift.

01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:40.072
I was up late last night binge-watching
my boy Rico Tubbs on <i>Miami Vice.</i>

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:43.951
<i>One more time, where's Pedroza?</i>

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.203
That was a cool brother right there.

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:49.747
Fifteen.

01:17:53.711 --> 01:17:55.254
- I almost forgot.
- What?

01:17:55.963 --> 01:17:58.799
- I got this off of Leon.
- Dude. Holy shit.

01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:00.801
Yeah. I really knocked that nigga out.

01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:02.803
Yeah. And you did it for me.

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:05.430
Yeah.

01:18:05.472 --> 01:18:06.891
- Yeah.
- Kind of.

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.104
That's what the guy said?

01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:15.733
Okay. No, to be honest,
this sounds like total dog shit to me.

01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:19.028
Look, I'll just deal with it
when I land. Yeah.

01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:20.404
Morning, Father.

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:21.946
Hey.

01:18:22.615 --> 01:18:23.490
Can we talk?

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:26.035
Sorry, late for a flight.
I'll call you when I land.

01:18:26.118 --> 01:18:28.958
Alicia made me borrow the Phantom
to drive her into the city last night.

01:18:31.415 --> 01:18:32.415
What?

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.044
For the record, it wasn't my fault.

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:38.648
You have no respect for how hard I work
to provide nice things for this family.

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:39.715
Yes, I do!

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:42.968
But honestly I'd rather just
have you around once in a while.

01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:45.179
Or what? Are you too embarrassed of me?

01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:47.723
- Don't be dramatic, Jeffrey.
- I'm dead-ass, Dad.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.309
What does "dead-ass" mean again?

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:53.062
You treat me being Owen's manager
as some big joke,

01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:56.732
but I have been putting in work
and busting my ass just like you.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.277
I wish you could acknowledge that.

01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:04.787
Can we talk about this next week
when I'm back?

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:06.617
I'll be up at school next week.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:09.703
Shit. That's right.

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:15.083
Hey.

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:17.001
Yeah.

01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:22.883
Text me when you get there.

01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:24.718
I'm very proud of this decision.

01:19:25.052 --> 01:19:27.888
- Thanks, Mom.
- I packed some meatloaf for the road.

01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:30.099
Added a new secret ingredient.

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:46.323
Thought you had a flight to catch.

01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:49.368
I do, but we didn't get to finish
our conversation.

01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:54.415
I felt bad about what you said, son.

01:19:57.543 --> 01:19:58.544
Sorry, can I take this?

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:00.461
Yeah.

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:04.758
- Hello?
<i>- Yo. Where my guy Jeffrey Levine at, man?</i>

01:20:04.925 --> 01:20:05.925
Who's this?

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:07.761
<i>Yo, it's French Montana, man.</i>

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:10.014
<i>I wanna talk to you
about your man Seezjah Boy.</i>

01:20:10.097 --> 01:20:13.976
Yeah, so he vomited on Wiz Khalifa
and had a seizure. So what?

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:16.419
I don't know what pleasure you get
out of making prank calls

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:17.980
pretending to be Karim Kharbouch,

01:20:18.063 --> 01:20:21.191
<i>but do me a favor
and eat a dick-full, Montana.</i>

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:22.359
<i>Damn!</i>

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:25.987
Prank call.

01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:28.031
Sorry, Dad.

01:20:28.615 --> 01:20:29.615
You were saying?

01:20:32.036 --> 01:20:34.236
Well, I haven't been around at all
this summer, and I...

01:20:34.705 --> 01:20:35.705
My God.

01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:37.458
It's okay, go ahead.

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.961
- What?
- Yo, what you mean "what"?

01:20:41.545 --> 01:20:43.881
And don't hang up 'cause
I ain't calling you back.

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:46.675
Let me tell you something,
this is your once in a lifetime,

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:48.469
<i>lightning-in-a-bottle moment.</i>

01:20:48.552 --> 01:20:51.513
I'm trying to sign your man OH!
To the Coke Boys.

01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:53.477
- Oh, my God!
<i>- I'm trying to bring you in, man.</i>

01:20:53.557 --> 01:20:55.934
<i>- I wanna bring you in the family.</i>
- What is going on?

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:58.705
'Cause I'm watching y'all on WorldStar,
and this video is incredible.

01:20:58.729 --> 01:21:00.898

Is that you?

01:21:15.329 --> 01:21:16.413
It is.

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:18.707
Whatever Coke Boys are offering,
I'll double it.

01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:21.056
This is Rahmel from Atlantic, by the way.

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.419
Yo, this is Pusha T.

01:21:22.503 --> 01:21:24.713
Jeff, it's Larry Jackson from Apple Music.

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:27.383
Before I sign OH! To G.O.O.D. Music,
let me ask you something.

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:29.551
Did he ever fuck your sister?

01:21:29.635 --> 01:21:31.595
I love OH!'s stuff, man.
How can I be down?

01:21:31.678 --> 01:21:34.390
Really sorry about... the pepper spray.

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:37.226
I didn't realize it was y'all niggas.

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:41.980
Yo.

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:44.108
<i>The Internet giveth
and the Internet taketh away.</i>

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:46.652
But sometimes when you try
really goddamn hard,

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.404
the Internet giveth a second chance.

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:49.904
Okay.

01:21:49.988 --> 01:21:51.407
Dead-ass!

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:53.158
Is that your dad?

01:22:06.130 --> 01:22:07.130
Yo, Alicia.

01:22:09.216 --> 01:22:10.342
Yo, Alicia, you up?

01:22:12.845 --> 01:22:13.845
Hey.

01:22:14.054 --> 01:22:15.054
Hey.

01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:17.683
What are you doing in here?

01:22:17.975 --> 01:22:19.685
Remember that pact we made,

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:24.064
that unbreakable pact
about the next time we see each other?

01:22:25.732 --> 01:22:26.732
Well...

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:28.026
here we are...

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:30.404
seeing each other for the next time.

01:22:41.081 --> 01:22:43.125
<i>OH! Succeeded because
he never gave up.</i>

01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:46.086
<i>And I was right by his side
every step of the way, cheering him on,</i>

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:48.422
<i>because I never for one second
doubted his talent.</i>

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:50.966
- <i>That was so much better.
- Actually? Really?</i>

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:52.843
Thank you. I've been working on, you know,

01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:55.429
trying to come across
as a little less dickish and insecure.

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:57.574
I think I'm doing awesome at it
so far though, right?

01:22:57.598 --> 01:22:59.391
- I'm killing it.
- Yeah, keep working on it.

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:01.476
Cool.

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:05.647
Make some noise!

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:06.814
What's up?

01:23:07.305 --> 01:23:13.333
