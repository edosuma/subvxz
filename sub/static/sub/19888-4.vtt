WEBVTT

00:01.869 --> 00:07.075
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

00:23.624 --> 00:25.093
I wish you luck
on your mission.

00:26.327 --> 00:27.561
QUINN: Luck?

00:27.595 --> 00:29.397
That's wishful thinking
for the weak.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.065
My Clippers are prepared.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.267
While you're gone,

00:36.337 --> 00:39.073
I'd like access
to the ventilation room.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.308
Henry still needs sunlight.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.277
Of course.

00:43.311 --> 00:44.812
You know how much
you and the boy mean to me.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.715
Your safety and care
always come first.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.450
That's why
I'm leaving Edgar behind.

00:49.483 --> 00:53.187
He's more than capable
of attending to your needs.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.789
Edgar's a good man,
but we'll be fine
by ourselves.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.492
I'd never take that chance.

01:06.834 --> 01:10.104
I always imagined
giving this to my son
one day.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.175
If I don't return,

01:16.810 --> 01:18.479
I want Henry to have it.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.082
I can't accept that.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.190
I insist.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.904
QUINN: Now, some may say
the world will end in fire.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.606
Some say ice.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.242
From what
I've tasted of desire,

01:48.276 --> 01:51.579
I hold with those
who favor fire.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.247
Visionary words,

01:53.281 --> 01:56.784
written by a wise man
centuries ago.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.852
Fire is pure and true,

01:58.886 --> 02:03.224
unlike certain humans
who amass power

02:03.257 --> 02:06.260
only to grow
corrupt and weak.

02:06.294 --> 02:09.930
The Badlands are now led
by people such as this!

02:09.963 --> 02:13.601
I know because I was one.

02:13.634 --> 02:17.871
But I give thanks
to the fire that consumed
my false empire,

02:17.905 --> 02:21.375
and brought me underground
here with you.

02:21.409 --> 02:24.612
That fire gave me clarity.
And another chance.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.781
To cleanse this land
once and for all.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.317
But this time,

02:29.350 --> 02:31.919
we are the fire.

02:31.952 --> 02:35.556
Together, we will torch
these liars and despots.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.558
ALL: Yeah!

02:37.591 --> 02:43.564
Our fire will regenerate
the land and let life
flourish again.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.667
Now we are the pure
and the true!

02:46.700 --> 02:49.403
ALL: We are the pure
and the true!

02:49.437 --> 02:52.540
Are you ready to be
that spark of liberation?

02:52.573 --> 02:54.375
ALL: Yeah!

02:54.408 --> 02:58.212
Are you willing
to die in the flames
of the inferno?

02:58.246 --> 02:59.847
ALL: Yes, Baron!

02:59.880 --> 03:05.753
Then let's burn this world
to the ground and start anew.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.456
ALL: Yeah!
(CHEERING)

03:08.489 --> 03:10.324
Yeah! Yeah!

03:10.358 --> 03:11.859
Yeah!

03:11.892 --> 03:13.227
Yeah!

03:13.261 --> 03:14.662
Yeah!
(ALL CHEERING)

04:01.609 --> 04:04.578
("NIGHT" PLAYING)

04:31.839 --> 04:33.941
You look
exceptionally fine.

04:33.974 --> 04:37.778
If we go down,
at least we go down
with style.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.880
Want some advice
from an old survivor?

04:44.952 --> 04:46.654
You are The Widow.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.822
When you walk
into that room,

04:48.856 --> 04:50.924
be what they least
expect you to be.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.461
Fearless.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.358
(SNIFFS)

05:27.160 --> 05:28.596
Ugh.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.504
Jellyfish.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.706
(CHUCKLES)

05:47.881 --> 05:49.850
Baron Chau.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.585
Look at them all.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.687
A bunch of
preening peacocks.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.525
You know, I wasn't
convinced you'd show up.

05:57.558 --> 05:58.859
I was talked into it.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.728
You're lucky
to have Waldo.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.696
The other Barons
respect him.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.833
If Quinn had kept his counsel,
he'd probably still be alive.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.770
Let's be honest
with each other.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.672
You married a Baron,

06:11.705 --> 06:13.874
killed him
and took his title.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.477
I defended myself
against a monster,

06:16.510 --> 06:17.911
as I'm sure you would've.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.581
I started at the bottom,
as a Colt for my father.

06:20.614 --> 06:24.652
And believe me,
I trained ten times as hard
as my sisters.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.887
But I earned
my title fairly

06:26.920 --> 06:31.659
by being tougher
and hungrier
than anybody else.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.194
You know, I quite liked
your husband actually.

06:34.227 --> 06:38.632
He was a cold-hearted bastard,
but we understood each other.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.934
That doesn't surprise me
in the least.

06:40.968 --> 06:41.969
WALDO: Baron.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.104
Waldo.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.009
You look ravishing
as always.

06:50.678 --> 06:53.614
Might I have
a private moment
with my Baron?

06:53.647 --> 06:54.882
Of course.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.054
Can we do this
without her vote?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.956
Not a chance.

07:02.990 --> 07:06.794
I've taken the temperature
of the room.
It's, uh, chilly.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.862
Broadmore's gonna
back Ryder

07:08.896 --> 07:11.031
'cause Ryder's
made him promises.

07:11.064 --> 07:14.635
Hassan and Rojas think
Ryder has overstepped,

07:14.668 --> 07:18.672
but they won't vote with us
unless we get a majority,
so you need Chau.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.520
I've been told to report
that all the refugees

07:32.553 --> 07:34.254
have been confined
to their quarters

07:34.287 --> 07:36.524
until The Widow returns.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.627
Odessa, I hardly
recognized you.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.796
(CLEARS THROAT)
Doll to butterfly.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.598
Hardly recognize myself.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.967
It's quite a metamorphosis
from the oil refinery.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.873
You should get
back to the courtyard.
Training's about to begin.

07:54.241 --> 07:57.077
Actually, I thought
you could train me.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.948
I'm Regent now.
I don't do that anymore.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.616
I have to protect
Mother's interests.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.624
So why hasn't
she taken you?

08:10.658 --> 08:12.860
I heard there's
a big meeting with
all the other Barons.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.029
She left me here in charge.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.231
Waldo went to protect her.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.733
The old man
in a wheelchair?

08:21.301 --> 08:23.671
I thought The Widow
was about empowering
women.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.740
She is.

08:26.774 --> 08:30.578
Mmm... Don't you think
the world's been screwed over
enough by men?

08:30.611 --> 08:33.614
Come on. She should
have taken you.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.049
It wasn't my decision,
it was hers.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.019
Maybe sometimes,
you should protect her
from herself.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.086
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

09:52.025 --> 09:53.293
WOMAN'S VOICE: M.K.!

09:56.163 --> 09:57.665
M.K.!

09:59.299 --> 10:01.735
M.K.: Mom? Mom?

10:08.742 --> 10:10.077
Mom?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.144
(GASPS)

10:12.312 --> 10:13.814
M.K., it's you.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.652
Mom. Mom, what happened?

10:18.686 --> 10:21.288
Everything you've done,
I forgive you.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.224
What? No. No.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.761
No, no, no, no, no!

10:27.795 --> 10:28.962
DARK M.K.:
There's no use.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.703
I told you
not to come back.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.271
Who did this?

10:38.305 --> 10:39.773
Look in the mirror.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.842
Tell me!

10:41.875 --> 10:43.210
You're the one
with blood on your hands.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.692
Where are you?

11:29.356 --> 11:30.057
Someone looks busy.
(HENRY COOING)

11:31.524 --> 11:33.060
I'm making breakfast.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.862
It was going to be
a surprise.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.029
That's so kind, Edgar.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.801
Uh, Henry needs his
daily dose of sunshine.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.803
Could you let me into
the ventilation room?

11:42.836 --> 11:44.037
Of course.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.778
(KEYS JANGLING)

11:57.785 --> 11:59.820
There you go.
Thanks, Edgar.

11:59.853 --> 12:00.988
I won't be long.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.729
(LOCK CLICKING)

12:16.003 --> 12:17.504
(HENRY FUSSES)

12:17.537 --> 12:19.506
It's gonna be
hard at first,

12:19.539 --> 12:23.043
but I know
we're gonna be fine.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.454
(GRUNTS)

12:52.205 --> 12:53.240
Wait.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.011
I saw you
at the reception,

12:58.045 --> 12:59.813
but I don't remember
training you.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.416
I'm new, Baroness.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.986
One of the house Cogs
fell ill and I had to step in.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.488
I've spent
all night preparing.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.958
I hope you're not upset.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.126
Actually,
I'm quite impressed.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.862
You're a quick study.
What's your name?

13:14.895 --> 13:17.097
Gabriel.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.099
Well, keep up
the good work, Gabriel.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.174
(SIGHS)

14:21.094 --> 14:24.497
Baron, we got word
from Gabriel.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.534
He's ready
to welcome us.
Mmm.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.583
Do you remember
your father, Jenkins?

14:43.616 --> 14:45.185
He died
when I was a boy.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.555
Well, you're lucky.

14:50.457 --> 14:54.127
At some point, all fathers
disappoint their sons.

14:54.161 --> 14:58.898
And then you become
a father and you realize
that sons disappoint as well.

15:01.701 --> 15:05.505
I haven't seen Ryder since
the night he betrayed me.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.077
I raised him to take power.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.379
And he did.

15:14.514 --> 15:17.617
Ryder will now pay
for his sins,

15:17.650 --> 15:19.319
along with
the other Barons.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.027
Hmm.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.030
Tell the men
we're moving out.

15:40.007 --> 15:43.476
(GRUNTS) Isn't this fun? Huh?

15:43.510 --> 15:46.746
(PANTING) We're climbing.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.215
Up and out we go.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.656
(HENRY FUSSING)

16:03.096 --> 16:04.264
Coming.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.233
EDGAR: Are you okay?

16:07.267 --> 16:08.668
Yeah, fine.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.340
Why is this door locked?

16:13.373 --> 16:15.475
It is never supposed
to be locked.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.576
I'm nursing Henry.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.354
Do you mind?

16:29.089 --> 16:30.257
Sorry.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.691
Is something wrong?

16:31.724 --> 16:34.194
No, ma'am.
Take your time.

17:15.268 --> 17:15.635
Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

17:18.871 --> 17:20.840
You went to
so much effort.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.275
It's an old recipe.

17:22.309 --> 17:23.710
I learned to make it
when I was a Colt.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.246
I foraged the mushrooms
when I was on patrol.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.514
Go on and have a seat.

18:06.453 --> 18:11.424
Edgar, I don't remember
the last time
I tasted anything this good.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.660
Thank you.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.202
To good food
and new friends.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.347
Is everything okay?

18:34.381 --> 18:37.450
I just wanted to tell you
how much I admired Sunny.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.886
He always inspired me
and the other guys.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.821
No one would ever
accuse him of
saying too much,

18:41.854 --> 18:43.890
but when he went
into action,

18:43.923 --> 18:46.359
it was a beautiful thing
to behold.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.295
The grace
of his sword strokes,

18:48.328 --> 18:50.463
he made killing
look so easy.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.567
To Sunny.

18:58.671 --> 18:59.872
To Sunny.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.481
I'm sorry.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.717
I didn't want to upset you.
I meant it as a compliment.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.151
I understand.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.322
That's just not
the Sunny I knew.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.723
You think
he's still alive?

19:17.724 --> 19:18.891
I hope so.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.295
Henry needs his father.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.202
I don't feel so good.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.172
(GROANS) Wonder if
those mushrooms...

19:37.977 --> 19:39.212
What did you do?

19:41.648 --> 19:43.516
You'll wake up
in an hour or so.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.257
Quinn...

19:50.857 --> 19:52.359
(PANTING)

19:52.959 --> 19:54.294
Why?

19:57.897 --> 19:59.232
I'm sorry, Edgar.

20:26.459 --> 20:29.529
Thank you for agreeing
to meet with me,
Baron Chau.

20:29.562 --> 20:33.533
I have to admit,
I was surprised
by your invitation.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.302
I'll get right
to the point.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.904
I want to offer you
a deal on my oil.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.006
This isn't
about commerce.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.608
It's about
a way of life.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.543
One that my ancestors
helped build.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.479
We've kept the Badlands
running smoothly
for over a century

20:46.513 --> 20:48.648
by providing
a labor force.

20:48.681 --> 20:52.285
And yet, you have
chosen to wage a war
against that reality.

20:52.319 --> 20:56.022
Your vision of a Cog-free
world is not only dangerous,

20:56.055 --> 20:58.825
but a threat
to my very existence.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.927
Five-eight-four-three.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.062
That was my number
in your Cog pens.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.964
I was 13 years old,

21:04.997 --> 21:06.766
we were herded
like animals,

21:06.799 --> 21:08.668
jammed in until
we could barely breathe.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.470
Torture and rape
were a way of life.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.606
So please don't lecture me
on the virtues of the system.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.542
Because I've experienced it
firsthand.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.577
And yet, here you are,

21:18.511 --> 21:20.012
a Baron.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.814
You know,
Quinn was a Cog too.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.917
The strong always
rise to the top.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.954
That's always been the case
with any species.

21:27.987 --> 21:31.958
If you wish to free
your own Cogs,
that is your business.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.893
But your
so-called Sanctuary

21:33.926 --> 21:36.496
is becoming
a haven for fugitives.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.498
And that's a threat
I cannot tolerate.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.733
And once again,
we're at an impasse.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.335
Perhaps not.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.737
Our world
is at a tipping point.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.073
A war is the last thing
it can endure.

21:47.106 --> 21:50.777
And if you lose the vote,
a war will surely follow.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.679
It is for that reason
and that reason alone

21:52.712 --> 21:55.081
I'm willing to throw
my full support
behind you...

21:55.114 --> 21:56.383
On one condition.

21:58.150 --> 22:02.422
You must pledge
not to shelter any more
runaway Cogs on your lands.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.660
I'll think it over.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.496
I'll give you
my answer at the vote.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.103
THE WIDOW: I don't see
how I can agree to this.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.605
WALDO: Change
doesn't come easy.

22:18.638 --> 22:19.939
You lose this vote,

22:19.972 --> 22:22.575
this revolution falls
flat on its face.

22:22.609 --> 22:25.077
And they'll either
banish you or kill you.

22:25.111 --> 22:28.681
Either way,
all your plans
come to nothing.

22:28.715 --> 22:31.384
You think that
compromise is weakness.

22:31.418 --> 22:32.585
It's not.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.554
It's survival.

25:59.959 --> 26:04.864
BROADMORE: This conclave of
the Foundation Treaty members
hereby commences.

26:06.198 --> 26:07.800
The issue at hand is a...

26:08.367 --> 26:10.302
A petition

26:10.336 --> 26:14.941
from our host
to reclaim oil fields
and associated lands.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.845
We shall now hear
from both sides.

26:22.649 --> 26:25.752
I am here today
at your request.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.286
But I owe nobody
an explanation,

26:27.319 --> 26:31.223
for why I took back
what was rightfully mine.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.060
Those oil fields
belonged to my husband

26:34.093 --> 26:36.228
and his father before him.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.064
I inherited them.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.832
And yet, when Quinn
seized them illegally,

26:39.866 --> 26:42.234
there was no conclave
called to restore my rights.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.937
Why is that?

26:44.971 --> 26:47.940
Perhaps there's
a different set of rules
for different Barons?

26:47.974 --> 26:49.642
BROADMORE: Quinn is dead,

26:49.676 --> 26:52.411
and we all agree
the Badlands are
better for it.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.714
This is not about him.

26:54.747 --> 26:58.050
No, it's clearly about me.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.953
My actions are
and were justified.

27:00.987 --> 27:03.255
What was seized illegally
is now mine again.

27:03.289 --> 27:06.092
The Foundation Treaty
is built upon many precepts.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.161
I assume you respect them all,

27:09.195 --> 27:12.164
or is it just those
that suit your interests?

27:12.198 --> 27:15.334
My feelings are well known
on the issue of Cogs.

27:15.367 --> 27:18.170
As such, I'd like to make
a pledge to you today.

27:18.204 --> 27:21.974
If my fellow Barons recognize
my rights to the oil fields,

27:22.008 --> 27:24.911
I will halt the practice of
giving runaway Cogs sanctuary.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.880
(SIGHS)

27:27.914 --> 27:29.716
Although I ask that those
who have already joined

27:29.749 --> 27:31.117
be granted the
right to remain.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.753
I hope that this compromise

27:33.786 --> 27:36.255
will put to rest
any lingering concerns.

27:36.288 --> 27:40.192
Don't believe a word
this woman says.

27:40.226 --> 27:44.797
She will try to free the Cogs
as sure as the sun will set.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.833
She is a treacherous liar!

27:49.101 --> 27:51.203
And I know from
personal experience.

27:52.972 --> 27:58.210
The Widow tried
to convince me
to incite a war

27:58.244 --> 28:00.479
between my father
and the late Baron Jacobee.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.348
Mmm, and you required
no convincing.

28:03.983 --> 28:06.118
Not exactly a denial, is it?

28:06.152 --> 28:09.421
You betrayed your father.
You murdered him, no less.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.457
Who are you to stand
in judgment of me?

28:12.524 --> 28:14.160
I stood against my father

28:15.862 --> 28:17.864
because he was reckless,

28:17.897 --> 28:21.100
because he cared
only about himself,

28:21.133 --> 28:24.403
because he was a danger
to our way of life,

28:24.436 --> 28:28.007
much like the woman
who stands before us today.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.843
A vote against
this pretender

28:30.877 --> 28:33.813
is a vote for a stronger
alliance among us.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.784
I submit that The Widow

28:37.817 --> 28:39.451
be stripped of her title

28:39.485 --> 28:43.022
and that she be banished
from the Badlands.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.435

by the code of conduct,

30:45.611 --> 30:49.949
you are hereby stripped

30:49.982 --> 30:52.151
All your land rights
and privileges

30:53.285 --> 30:55.587
are hereby revoked.

30:55.621 --> 31:02.094
You have 48 hours
to leave the Badlands.

31:02.128 --> 31:06.432
You will take my land
over my dead body.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.267

a peaceful resolution.

south of his compound.

32:00.219 --> 32:04.290

that someone might
try to harm them.

taken precautions
to protect what is yours.
