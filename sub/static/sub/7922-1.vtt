WEBVTT

02:31.860 --> 02:33.820
Hey, this is it, loco.

03:12.067 --> 03:15.236
Hey, man. Fuck this, man.
I ain't with this shit.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.237
Y'all can have this.

03:17.989 --> 03:18.989
What?

03:19.241 --> 03:21.371
<i>I just ain't into this
dead people shit, all right?</i>

03:21.702 --> 03:24.712
Shit, man. That place
does look evil as hell.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.876
Look, man, both y'all need
to shut the fuck up, all right?

03:30.877 --> 03:31.787
We're doin' this shit

03:31.795 --> 03:33.085
'cause this here's
business, man.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.258
Besides, dead people ain't who
y'all need to be

03:35.259 --> 03:36.757
worried about anyway.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.472
Little Moe who the fuck y'all
need to be worried about.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.551
Now, the sooner
we get the shit...

03:41.555 --> 03:43.965
The sooner we raise up
outta this motherfucker, man.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.404
Pass the buds, you little bitch.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.106
Let's roll, brother.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.495
Hey, man, uh...

04:12.043 --> 04:14.300
Maybe I need... I need
to stay out here, all right,

04:14.301 --> 04:17.296
and watch y'all's back and shit,
in case something funny go down.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.796
Wait a minute, man.
You got your gat, man?

04:20.010 --> 04:21.430
Yeah, I got my shit.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.852
Well, if a dead motherfucker
come fuckin' with you,

04:24.139 --> 04:25.179
you kill his ass.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.562
Do you understand me?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.479
Yeah, hold on...
Hold on, bulldog.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.561
How am I supposed
to kill somethin'

04:32.564 --> 04:33.654
that's already dead, man?

04:34.149 --> 04:35.149
What?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.565
Yeah, how am I
supposed to kill somethin'

04:36.568 --> 04:37.568
that's already dead?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.611
That's like killing
some shit twice, man.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.067
Yeah, like some re-fried beans
and some shit.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.369
Man, I never understood that,
man.

04:45.370 --> 04:48.158
Why the fuck you
gonna re-fry some beans, man?

04:48.497 --> 04:52.077
Why not just fry that shit right
the first time and get out?

04:52.083 --> 04:54.293
Look, both y'all,
shut the fuck up, all right?

04:54.294 --> 04:56.844
Let's just take care of
this business and move on, man.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.882
Shit.

04:59.674 --> 05:02.264
Fuck... this is
dead people's shit!

05:10.101 --> 05:11.021
All right, shut up.

05:11.022 --> 05:13.649
Ain't nothin' to be scared of.
Understand me?

05:22.906 --> 05:24.446
- Damn!
- What the fuck? Let's go!

05:28.495 --> 05:31.405
I've been waiting for you, boys.

05:43.552 --> 05:46.012
- I have some iodine in the lab.
- Hey, man.

05:46.263 --> 05:47.181
I don't need nothin'

05:47.182 --> 05:48.582
from your house
of dead folks, okay?

05:48.765 --> 05:49.845
Besides, I ain't no baby.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.352
Of course, you're not.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.686
'Looked like one
when that door swung open.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.809
Nigger, what's up, man?

05:56.815 --> 05:59.145
Come on... come on, partner.
Got no time for this.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.188
Let's just take care
of this business

06:01.194 --> 06:02.204
and move on, man.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.163
Now, where's the shit?

06:07.075 --> 06:08.195
The shit?

06:08.451 --> 06:11.541
The shit...
The shit that you found.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.707
Oh.

06:15.876 --> 06:16.916
The drugs.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.424
I found a whole stock of them
in the alley.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.092
So where they at?

06:27.971 --> 06:28.971
You got the money?

06:29.139 --> 06:30.599
Yeah, we got the money, old man.

06:30.765 --> 06:31.925
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

06:32.392 --> 06:34.232
<i>You'll get it
when we get the shit.</i>

06:34.853 --> 06:35.983
The shit?

06:38.189 --> 06:39.939
The shit. The drugs.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.002
You get the drugs,
then I get the money.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.527
Okay.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.202
You know, this is all new to me.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.065
I'm not a drug dealer.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.869
I'm a mortician.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.384
The only drugs I know about...

07:00.211 --> 07:03.461
Are those that have to do
with the deceased.

07:03.632 --> 07:06.762
Yo, man, what kind of drugs
do dead people be needin'?

07:06.763 --> 07:08.050
<i>All kinds.</i>

07:08.803 --> 07:12.313
We shoot them real good
with embalming fluid, mainly.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.426
You know, it keeps them from...

07:16.186 --> 07:17.396
smelling...

07:17.938 --> 07:20.898
And decomposing
before the service.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.149
Cool.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.112
Hey, so what happened to him?

07:24.444 --> 07:28.164
<i>Oh, they say he went crazy.</i>

07:29.157 --> 07:30.237
Death...

07:30.867 --> 07:34.947
It comes
in many strange packages.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.620
Hey, man, I don't need
to be hearin' this, man.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.674
I mean, kill that noise, man.
Let's just get the shit.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.094
Don't worry.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.803
You'll get the shit.

07:46.007 --> 07:50.507
You'll be knee-deep...
In the shit.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.308
I've got it hid.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.688
There's so much...

07:59.062 --> 08:01.482
I couldn't even
lift it all myself.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.903
I'll tell you about...

08:05.860 --> 08:08.070
old Clarence here along the way.

08:09.531 --> 08:10.661
Unless, of course...

08:11.866 --> 08:12.906
you're scared.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.119
<i>Hmm?</i>

08:17.163 --> 08:21.083
They say he was hearing voices...

08:23.003 --> 08:24.923
Voices calling his name...

08:25.755 --> 08:27.875
Voices from the dead...

08:29.092 --> 08:30.552
Calling...

08:31.720 --> 08:34.559
<i>"Clarence!"</i>

08:36.349 --> 08:39.639
<i>"Clarence!"</i>

08:40.770 --> 08:43.940
<i>"Clarence!"</i>

08:45.233 --> 08:49.243
<i>"Clarence!"</i>

08:57.037 --> 09:01.497
Now, Clarence, now this here
is a real quiet neighborhood...

09:01.916 --> 09:05.376
But that doesn't mean
that you can take a break.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.628
'Cause the second
you slack off, boom!

09:08.339 --> 09:10.419
That's just when the shit
hits the fan.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.382
Got it. Stay alert at all times.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.545
That's right.

09:14.012 --> 09:16.642
Now, let's go up and check out
this out-of-place.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.060
Gonna lose
your badges over this.

09:19.061 --> 09:20.559
You had no reason
to pull me over.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.093
You got a fuckin' taillight out.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.399
Shut up and spread
them goddamn legs.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.616
You're not taking
any more cops' badges.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.325
They keep selling drugs
in my community,

09:37.327 --> 09:39.087
I'll keep taking 'em down.
You can bet on it!

09:39.954 --> 09:42.294
Yeah? Well,
we'll see about that.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.998
- Hey, what do we got, fellas?
- No, no, no, rookie, rookie.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.207
He'll get it. Just back...
Back off.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.263
Go on your way.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.715
Go run a check
on his license plate.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.176
See if the car is stolen.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.468
- It's okay. Go on.
- We got it.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.476
<i>Come on. Spread 'em.</i>

10:08.483 --> 10:09.573
<i>Spread 'em.</i>

10:12.946 --> 10:14.316
Now, let me ask you
something, huh?

10:14.697 --> 10:16.117
Are you getting off on, uh...

10:16.407 --> 10:18.697
Destroying good cops' lives,
hmm?

10:19.035 --> 10:21.785
You big-mouthed goddamn
son of a bitch!

10:22.038 --> 10:23.788
I've got nothing
against good cops.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.790
You what?

10:24.791 --> 10:27.331
I said I've got nothing
against good cops...

10:27.335 --> 10:29.035
But I will see lowlife scum
like you

10:29.045 --> 10:30.165
run out of the department.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.590
Will you shut the fuck up,

10:31.798 --> 10:32.798
cocksucker!

10:35.426 --> 10:36.426
<i>Shit!</i>

10:37.470 --> 10:38.930
You're fuckin' dead, bro.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.845
You fucked up...
Big time.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.450
Let me have some of this.
Let me have some.

10:47.564 --> 10:48.694
Look at me!

10:49.774 --> 10:51.233
Newton, you want in?

10:51.234 --> 10:53.114
Yeah. Let me teach him
a thing or two.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.030
[ Laughs I

11:01.286 --> 11:03.156
you there, huh?
You inside, huh?

11:03.371 --> 11:04.371
Are you there?

11:05.331 --> 11:07.421
<i>And I promise you...</i>

11:07.876 --> 11:09.536
we won't stop

11:09.752 --> 11:12.502
until we get every single
crooked cop in this city.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.872
<i>Oh, my god, Martin moorehouse.</i>

11:14.007 --> 11:16.427
<i>Neither drugs
nor pretenders of the law...</i>

11:16.593 --> 11:19.553
<i>Will be allowed to drain
the life of this community.</i>

11:20.847 --> 11:22.717
- Hey!
- Son of a bitch.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.684
Hey!

11:25.977 --> 11:27.454
Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing?

11:27.478 --> 11:28.396
<i>Strum!</i>

11:28.397 --> 11:30.197
- Stop them! Stop 'em!
- That's enough, strom.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.904
- Stop it!
- Not in front of the rookie.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.653
This man is Martin moorehouse!

11:36.988 --> 11:38.568
I can't believe
I didn't recognize him.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.449
Fuck.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.240
What the hell's wrong with you?

11:43.244 --> 11:44.314
What the hell is wrong with you?

11:44.329 --> 11:45.749
- Hey! Hey, back off!
- Fuck off!

11:46.080 --> 11:47.320
This is no time to be fighting.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.833
We gotta get this guy
to a hospital!

11:49.834 --> 11:51.214
That's right. We gotta get him
to a hospital.

11:51.215 --> 11:52.381
Now, let's do it, huh?

11:52.712 --> 11:53.712
- Come on.
- God.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.341
You hear?
You want some of me?

11:56.633 --> 11:58.133
You're out of line!

11:58.843 --> 12:00.093
You get your ass out of here.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.974
We'll take care of it.
Get outta here!

12:03.473 --> 12:04.723
You get back there in the unit!

12:05.183 --> 12:06.903
- Get out of here.
- Finish our damn patrol!

12:11.731 --> 12:13.271
Son of a bitch.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.986
Strom, you know
what you have to do.

12:23.826 --> 12:24.826
Damn it! We...

12:25.078 --> 12:27.158
We need to report
those assholes, Newton.

12:32.961 --> 12:36.051
You listen to me!
And you listen good.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.553
Those assholes are cops.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.048
Who the fuck are you
to judge 'em?

12:43.429 --> 12:45.429
Shit, man, you got a green dick.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.021
Those two guys have
been risking their asses

12:47.022 --> 12:48.426
on the street for years.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.895
See, the fucker went
for strom's gun.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.396
Aw, bullshit.

12:52.397 --> 12:55.147
Oh, now, maybe those two guys
went too far tonight.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.819
Maybe it was all a mistake.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.031
But next time it could be you.

13:03.074 --> 13:06.124
So, you know,
you don't ever roll over...

13:06.619 --> 13:10.499
And you never...
Rat out a fellow officer.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.788
And you never...

13:15.003 --> 13:18.343
never break the code.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.645
Knock, knock. We're here.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.449
- Hospital?
- Mm-hmm.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.200
Yeah. Come on, boy.
We'll get you all fixed up.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.934
Wanna have a little party?
Hmm?

14:07.221 --> 14:10.931
You see, you were right
about one thing.

14:13.853 --> 14:18.323
<i>The cops are dealing
drugs in the sixth precinct.</i>

14:21.444 --> 14:23.654
But you're never gonna
tell about it, are ya?

14:27.784 --> 14:30.044
- Think that's enough?
- Just put 'em in the trunk.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.700
<i>Clarence!</i>

15:09.784 --> 15:12.544
<i>Bring them to me.</i>

15:38.104 --> 15:42.114
<i>Bring them to me!</i>

16:01.002 --> 16:03.922
Clarence, bring them to me.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.724
Bring them to me.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.012
I will.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.559
I will.

16:17.768 --> 16:18.848
<i>I will.</i>

16:40.708 --> 16:42.578
Welcome, officers.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.804
For a minute, I thought
you weren't gonna show.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.548
Man, he looks
like fly-covered shit.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.471
Say what?

16:51.472 --> 16:53.759
You look like fly-covered shit
there, Clarence.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.812
Haven't seen you in a long time,
Clarence.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.311
I've missed ya, pal.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.137
You had the number.

17:00.145 --> 17:02.025
You should've reached out
and touched a brother.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.041
You could've told him how
to reach out

17:05.066 --> 17:06.856
and touch a brother,
couldn't you, strom?

17:07.777 --> 17:08.857
Now, Clarence...

17:09.819 --> 17:11.490
Clarence Smith...

17:11.864 --> 17:13.454
Come on.
Come on.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.657
Come on down from the grave.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.865
Now, let me ask you this, son.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.580
What the fuck you call us
out here for, huh? Huh?

17:21.582 --> 17:22.749
A celebration.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.170
No, no, no.
Answer me, boy!

17:24.417 --> 17:25.917
What'd you call us out here for?

17:29.173 --> 17:30.298
To celebrate!

17:30.299 --> 17:32.089
What are we celebrating tonight?

17:34.303 --> 17:35.683
Anniversary.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.271
Our anniversary.
You remember, don't you?

17:41.102 --> 17:42.562
One year ago today.

17:43.896 --> 17:47.065
I fell for your bullshit.
You know, I actually believed...

17:47.066 --> 17:50.396
That strom and Billy were gonna
take moorehouse to the hospital.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.823
Shut the fuck up!

17:52.530 --> 17:53.820
You don't get it, do ya?

17:54.282 --> 17:56.449
We tried to take him,
and he didn't wanna go.

17:56.450 --> 17:57.909
<i>You understand?
He didn't want to go.</i>

17:57.910 --> 17:59.828
Just cut the shit, strom!

17:59.829 --> 18:02.409
<i>- Shut the fuck up, boy:
- Clarence: Cut the shit!</i>

18:02.415 --> 18:03.535
Shut the fuck up!

18:03.541 --> 18:05.041
Cut the shit!

18:06.961 --> 18:08.670
That story never did
make any sense.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.761
- Just save it.
- Save it for who?

18:11.465 --> 18:15.505
Hey, Clarence,
if we go down, you go down.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.391
Yeah, that's right, Clarence.
You go down.

18:17.722 --> 18:20.522
You guys killed a good man
and you ruined his name!

18:21.934 --> 18:23.024
I should've turned you in

18:23.227 --> 18:24.897
instead of just
quittin' the force.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.729
You quit because you're a pussy.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.361
You're a goddamn pussy.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.276
So I thought the least
we could do is pay our respects.

18:36.907 --> 18:40.077
What do you mean "pay respects"?

18:41.287 --> 18:43.657
Pay Martin moorehouse
a little visit.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.415
Or are you too much of a pussy
to visit him?

18:49.170 --> 18:50.800
A fuckin' fruitcake.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.134
How are we supposed
to visit a dead guy?

18:54.135 --> 18:56.551
Are you saying...
You want us to go

18:56.552 --> 18:58.178
out to moorehouse's
grave with you?

18:58.179 --> 19:00.419
- That's exactly what I'm saying.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.060
Huh?

19:02.061 --> 19:03.268
Fuck you.

19:05.227 --> 19:08.557
If we go, will that be
the end of it?

19:08.564 --> 19:09.774
You'll be satisfied?

19:11.567 --> 19:13.647
I'll be totally satisfied.

19:15.071 --> 19:19.031
Well, in that case,
I don't think there's a problem.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.700
- I got no problem.
- You guys agree?

19:22.620 --> 19:23.950
Follow me, fellas.

19:23.954 --> 19:27.044
- Lead the way.
- Let's go.

19:29.627 --> 19:30.997
Hey, what the fuck are we doing?

19:31.003 --> 19:33.633
Clarence won't be
making it back.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.823
How much further, Clarence?

19:58.948 --> 20:00.448
Martin is right here.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.831
This grave.

20:05.579 --> 20:06.789
I brought them.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.747
Are you happy?

20:12.294 --> 20:13.294
Shit.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.632
You expect us to believe you're
talkin' to this dead fucker?

20:17.842 --> 20:18.842
[ Laughs I

20:19.552 --> 20:21.892
quite frankly,
I don't know what to expect.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.845
My orders
were to get you out here.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.767
I'm good at that, you know?

20:27.810 --> 20:29.520
Following orders?

20:33.816 --> 20:35.276
It's just an electrical storm.

20:35.693 --> 20:36.611
What the hell, all of a sudden,

20:36.612 --> 20:37.651
we're supposed to be
scared to death?

20:37.653 --> 20:38.703
Is that it? Huh?

20:38.863 --> 20:40.783
Don't know, strom.
Should you be?

20:41.157 --> 20:43.737
You know what? You piss me off.
Hmm? You know that?

20:46.495 --> 20:48.075
I'm gonna be
the first to volunteer.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.079
You're not gonna...

20:50.082 --> 20:51.582
You know what I'm gonna do?
Huh?

20:53.419 --> 20:55.089
You know what I'm gonna do, boy?

20:56.547 --> 20:58.757
Get out of my way.

21:00.926 --> 21:01.926
[ Laughs I

21:02.928 --> 21:04.428
I'm gonna piss on...

21:05.848 --> 21:07.598
I'm gonna piss on his grave.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.057
[ Laughs I

21:16.692 --> 21:17.982
oh.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.740
Way to go, strom.
That's... that's pretty cool.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.157
You know what?

21:27.870 --> 21:29.160
Kind of dry here.

21:29.163 --> 21:31.793
Uh, Billy, why don't you come on
over here and piss with me?

21:33.042 --> 21:34.332
You know, I don't
need to go, man.

21:34.335 --> 21:36.375
I took a piss right before
we came out here.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.094
Did you hear what I said?

21:39.173 --> 21:40.673
- Did you hear what I said?
- I don't need to.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.134
I said go piss on it.
Now, do it!

21:42.301 --> 21:44.391
For Christ's sakes, strom,
leave him alone.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.761
It's okay, man.

21:52.353 --> 21:53.773
Piss.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.220
This'll be as good
a place as any

21:57.316 --> 22:00.396
to bleed the
old lizard, I guess.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.123
Come on.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.383
Say good night.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.086
Come on now.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.383
Shouldn't have done that, man.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.096
What in the hell have you done?

22:31.350 --> 22:32.180
<i>Strum!</i>

<i>Holy shit!</i>

<i>Where the fuck did he go?</i>

22:39.817 --> 22:41.025
<i>Oh, god!</i>

22:41.026 --> 22:42.236
Where the fuck did he go?

22:43.153 --> 22:44.153
Get outta the way!

22:49.076 --> 22:50.616
Stop shooting, goddamn it!

22:50.619 --> 22:51.999
There's nothing there!
He's gone!

22:52.162 --> 22:54.291
Damn it, man, this is
no time to panic!

22:54.292 --> 22:56.630
Well, when the fuck
do we start to panic?

23:07.636 --> 23:09.506
- Holy shit!
- Jesus!

<i>Oh, god.

<i>- Billy!
- What?</i>

23:15.144 --> 23:17.104
<i>Oh, no!

23:22.443 --> 23:23.573
Now! Shoot him!

That the body of a citizen
we murdered

26:59.201 --> 27:01.791
Oh, yeah... I killed him.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.156
I killed him.

Whoa. Hey, man!

<i>No!</i>

Welcome to my world.

28:36.965 --> 28:39.335
Are you satisfied now, brother?

28:41.220 --> 28:43.470
Where were you...

28:43.847 --> 28:47.677
When I needed you, brother?

28:54.733 --> 28:57.533
[ Whimpering

29:03.742 --> 29:05.242

29:07.663 --> 29:09.463
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't hurt me.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.574
So, what's the story
with this guy?

29:18.674 --> 29:20.014
Homicidal maniac.

29:20.217 --> 29:22.297
Cop killer.
Three in one night.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.261
And trip this.
He used to be a cop.

29:25.514 --> 29:26.514
Wow!

29:27.015 --> 29:28.725
Man, you just never know, do ya?

29:39.695 --> 29:43.025
Yes, sir. Crazy as a loon.

29:44.324 --> 29:47.914
Talk about some insane
in the membrane type of shit.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.158
Shut up, man.

29:49.162 --> 29:51.292
The pigs got what they deserved,
homeboy.

29:51.707 --> 29:52.707
Nah, man.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.648
What shit are you
talking about, man?

29:55.043 --> 29:56.173
It can't be for real.

29:56.174 --> 30:00.669
Sometimes... reality
is just a matter of perception.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.430
What the fuck now?

30:05.345 --> 30:06.635
Reality.

30:07.264 --> 30:08.264
Perception.

30:09.266 --> 30:12.306
A cornucopia of clashing.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.151
Divergent ideas.

30:16.857 --> 30:17.857
Crazy, man.

30:18.275 --> 30:19.775
Hey, come on, man.

30:22.487 --> 30:23.907
Man, what type of shit?

30:24.323 --> 30:26.283
What the fuck happened to him?

30:26.491 --> 30:28.621
Hey, can we just
get our shit and go?

30:29.703 --> 30:30.873
Oh, no.

30:31.538 --> 30:33.368
You're gonna want to hear
about this one.

30:34.416 --> 30:35.996
It's a classic case...

30:36.835 --> 30:39.665
Of what is and isn't real...

30:40.589 --> 30:41.839
In the mind...

30:42.924 --> 30:46.014
Of a boy... named Walter.

30:47.596 --> 30:49.136
Perception?

30:50.640 --> 30:52.180
Reality?

30:53.685 --> 30:55.225
Walter.

31:50.117 --> 31:51.907
All right, everybody,
take your seats.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.497
<i>Okay, we have a new student
joining us today.</i>

32:01.503 --> 32:04.713
I want you all to say hello
to Walter.

32:06.383 --> 32:09.513
Hello, Walter.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.724
- You wanna do something, punk?
- Yeah, we don't like punks.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.385
- I'm not a punk.
- "I'm not a punk."

32:17.811 --> 32:19.191
Who you shovin', bitch?

32:22.774 --> 32:24.904
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

32:27.362 --> 32:29.242
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:29.739 --> 32:31.199
Everybody go back
to their class.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.078
Oh, man!

32:34.578 --> 32:35.496
What's your problem?

32:35.497 --> 32:37.076
You must really like detention,
huh, Ty?

32:38.123 --> 32:39.293
Come on.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.088
Here, honey.
Hold this up to your head.

32:47.299 --> 32:50.009
So, uh, how's
the little warrior doin'?

32:50.594 --> 32:51.854
He's got a thick head.

32:54.181 --> 32:56.101
I am worried about that, though.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.976
Did Tyrone hit you in the eye?

32:59.603 --> 33:01.063
That didn't just happen.

33:01.064 --> 33:03.402
It's a couple of days old.
Look at the coloring.

33:05.525 --> 33:06.935
Tyrone didn't hit you?

33:09.154 --> 33:10.074
<i>Well, who did?</i>

33:10.075 --> 33:11.532
<i>Was it one of the other boys?</i>

33:15.452 --> 33:16.452
Walter.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.418
Was it someone at home?
Maybe your mother?

33:26.338 --> 33:28.506
Your father?
Did he do this?

33:28.507 --> 33:30.297
Uh-uh. He's dead.

33:31.635 --> 33:32.635
I'm sorry.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.845
<i>Walter, if you tell me
and nurse parch-man...</i>

33:35.847 --> 33:38.467
It'll just be
our little secret, okay?

33:40.685 --> 33:42.225
The monster.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.572
The monster?

33:46.858 --> 33:49.028
He came after my dad died.

33:50.111 --> 33:52.201
<i>- I see.
- Hmm.</i>

33:53.156 --> 33:56.076
If you decide you want to
tell me what really happened...

33:56.618 --> 33:59.198
I'm gonna be here
to listen, okay?

34:04.668 --> 34:06.878
He said no one would believe me.

35:22.829 --> 35:23.829
Mommy.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.029
Walter.

35:59.658 --> 36:00.948
He's back.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.956
Is the monster gone?

36:07.290 --> 36:10.420
Now, Walter, you be sure and
put this back just like this.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.350
<i>Ow! Stop!</i>

36:42.409 --> 36:43.659
<i>Walter?</i>

36:45.286 --> 36:46.906
You didn't want to go outside?

36:53.795 --> 36:55.705
- What's that?
- Him.

36:56.506 --> 36:58.256
<i>- Him?
- The monster.</i>

37:03.638 --> 37:05.928
Laurie told me to draw it,
then we'll destroy it...

37:05.932 --> 37:07.432
And the monster's gonna go away.

37:09.436 --> 37:12.396
- Laurie that sits behind you?
- I'm gonna burn him up.

37:14.357 --> 37:15.937
Laurie said that her mom said

37:15.942 --> 37:17.532
to draw the things
that scared her...

37:17.902 --> 37:19.452
Then tear it up or burn it...

37:19.654 --> 37:20.954
And then it'll go away.

37:24.993 --> 37:26.083
That's Tyrone.

37:30.832 --> 37:31.832
Walter...

37:33.293 --> 37:34.843
Do you think I could, uh...

37:36.254 --> 37:37.594
talk to your mother sometime?

37:37.797 --> 37:38.837
What for?

37:38.840 --> 37:39.920
About the monster.

37:40.383 --> 37:41.763
Now, you've told her,
haven't you?

37:42.051 --> 37:44.891
She doesn't want to hear it.
She says we already moved once.

37:46.306 --> 37:49.516
You know, I don't think...

37:50.018 --> 37:52.308
That drawing these pictures
is really...

37:53.313 --> 37:55.323
the answer to your problem.

37:55.774 --> 37:59.534
But I think we can work
something out together, okay?

38:01.279 --> 38:02.279
Okay?

38:02.739 --> 38:03.909
<i>I guess so.</i>

38:04.824 --> 38:08.624
Good. I will see you
after recess.

38:09.788 --> 38:10.788
All right.

38:28.431 --> 38:29.431
Excuse me, guys.

38:30.767 --> 38:31.807
What happened to him?

38:32.227 --> 38:33.847
He was running in the building
after recess

38:33.853 --> 38:35.023
and fell down the stairs.

38:36.523 --> 38:37.863
Well, did somebody shove him?

38:38.233 --> 38:39.323
- No, he just fell.
- No?

38:39.692 --> 38:40.982
Sort of collapsed.

38:41.694 --> 38:42.994
But, you know,
it makes no sense.

38:43.404 --> 38:46.784
How do you break both arms
and legs falling down?

38:47.951 --> 38:49.831
Boy must've had weak bones.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.196
- Who is it?
- I'm Mr. Garvey.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.368
I'm one of Walter's
teachers from school.

39:39.085 --> 39:41.795
Uh... this fell.

39:42.964 --> 39:45.757
Thank you.
Is there a problem?

39:45.758 --> 39:49.678
- No, no, Mrs... miss...
- Miss.

39:50.305 --> 39:53.765
Miss Johnson, can I come in
and talk to you for a minute?

39:55.268 --> 39:56.478
Yes. I'm sorry.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.353
I'm gonna go throw something on.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.745
Damn.

40:24.797 --> 40:26.467
Miss Johnson,
I came to talk to you

40:26.674 --> 40:27.883
about your boy Walter.

40:27.884 --> 40:31.345
Because he seems to be having
some problems.

40:31.346 --> 40:32.386
Problems?

40:33.848 --> 40:34.638
Uh...

40:34.807 --> 40:38.597
Yeah. Perhaps because he
just recently changed schools.

40:39.228 --> 40:40.598
What kind of problems?

40:41.189 --> 40:43.439
I mean, all kids have problems,
don't they?

40:43.441 --> 40:46.321
That's what life is... problems.

40:46.945 --> 40:47.855
He got you good.

40:47.863 --> 40:49.413
Here, step into
the light for me?

40:49.697 --> 40:51.067
Oh, yeah. Um...

40:52.241 --> 40:56.741
Well, he seems to come to school
with a lot bruises, you know?

40:59.958 --> 41:01.288
Kind of banged up.

41:01.834 --> 41:03.214
The boy is clumsy.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.416
He's always falling
over somethin'.

41:06.047 --> 41:07.247
I don't know where he gets it.

41:07.799 --> 41:08.799
Not me.

41:10.176 --> 41:11.756
Certainly not me.

41:16.349 --> 41:18.229
Certainly not.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.265
But, uh...

41:21.020 --> 41:23.110
But he does seem to have
a strange...

41:23.773 --> 41:25.443
Preoccupation with monsters.

41:25.692 --> 41:27.942
<i>I mean, a monster
in particular...</i>

41:27.944 --> 41:31.034
<i>That he says
lives here in the house.</i>

41:31.280 --> 41:33.320
<i>It sounds silly, but...</i>

41:34.158 --> 41:35.158
Walter!

41:35.493 --> 41:38.078
Listen, there is no need
to bring Walter into this.

41:38.079 --> 41:39.079
Look!

41:39.664 --> 41:42.084
I've told that boy about
going on with these stories.

41:42.085 --> 41:43.633
I can't have it.
Walter!

41:44.002 --> 41:47.212
I said get your narrow behind
in this kitchen now!

41:47.588 --> 41:50.588
Miss Johnson,
I just came to talk to you.

41:53.678 --> 41:54.888
Get over here.

41:56.055 --> 41:57.555
What is your problem?

41:58.016 --> 41:59.636
Now, why the hell are you
going on

41:59.976 --> 42:02.186
telling this man
these crazy stories?

42:03.271 --> 42:04.938
Didn't I tell you to stop

42:04.939 --> 42:06.899
with all this
monster foolishness? Didn't I?

42:15.408 --> 42:16.778
Go to your room.

42:17.577 --> 42:19.367
Baby, go to your room now.

42:22.165 --> 42:23.535
I'm gonna have
to deal with this.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.711
Miss Johnson, if you would
give me a second to talk?

42:25.712 --> 42:29.090
Please... just keep quiet.

42:30.006 --> 42:31.376
Don't say nothin'.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.385
Well, why are you
just standing there?

42:42.393 --> 42:43.833
Why the hell didn't you
get the door?

42:44.353 --> 42:45.443
Who's that?

42:46.481 --> 42:48.571
That's just one
of Walter's teachers.

42:48.941 --> 42:50.361
He was just leaving.

42:54.155 --> 42:55.735
Is there a problem?

42:55.740 --> 42:56.780
No.

42:56.783 --> 42:59.703
Actually, he just came over
to drop off some homework.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.870
Actually, sir,
now that you mention it...

43:03.206 --> 43:06.416
Walter does seem to be having
a few small problems...

43:06.584 --> 43:09.594
That might deserve
some looking into.

43:23.518 --> 43:25.348
<i>Well, Walter's only been
at this school</i>

43:25.353 --> 43:26.563
<i>for a couple of weeks...</i>

43:26.979 --> 43:29.439
And he does have trouble
making friends.

43:29.857 --> 43:33.107
So what kind of problem
are we talking about?

43:35.279 --> 43:37.569
Well, aside from the bruises...

43:38.366 --> 43:39.446
Aside from that...

43:39.617 --> 43:43.077
There's, uh, this monster
that he says is in the house.

43:43.663 --> 43:46.373
He seems very disturbed by it.

43:46.374 --> 43:48.464
In fact, he's even
drawn a picture...

43:48.626 --> 43:50.126
Of the monster.

43:59.512 --> 44:03.772
He, uh, thinks he needs
to kill the monster.

44:04.517 --> 44:08.147
I mean, he...
He really believes it.

44:12.733 --> 44:13.903
I'll talk to him.

44:14.902 --> 44:17.282
That's it?
You'll just talk to him?

44:19.532 --> 44:22.332
I will talk to him.

44:28.666 --> 44:29.916
Okay.

44:32.211 --> 44:35.631
Sissy, would you show him
to the door, please?

44:42.305 --> 44:43.675
Thanks for the tea.

45:04.452 --> 45:05.832
Go to your room.

45:13.628 --> 45:15.088
- Miss Johnson...
- Go!

45:57.755 --> 45:58.875
Walter!

45:59.423 --> 46:01.593
You little motherfucker.

46:02.385 --> 46:05.715
You like to draw fucked-up
pictures of people, huh?

46:09.767 --> 46:10.767
Huh?

46:10.810 --> 46:11.940
Carl, no!

46:29.328 --> 46:31.748
I'm gonna teach you
and that boy some respect.

46:32.999 --> 46:34.829
Help me!

46:38.379 --> 46:39.799
Stop!

46:40.298 --> 46:41.468
<i>Stop!</i>

46:48.097 --> 46:49.847
You gonna make a picture
to kill me?

46:50.516 --> 46:52.306
Motherfuck...!
Come here!

46:52.310 --> 46:53.520
Carl, please!

46:59.942 --> 47:00.942
Open up!

47:01.569 --> 47:02.569
<i>Miss Johnson!</i>

47:02.611 --> 47:04.361
Your little ass is mine!

47:04.905 --> 47:06.565
Oh, you gonna draw a picture
of somebody

47:06.574 --> 47:07.994
and make them look
like a monster?

47:07.995 --> 47:10.912
But you think
that shit is funny? Huh?

47:11.954 --> 47:13.504
<i>- Get up!
- Miss Johnson!</i>

47:15.166 --> 47:17.666
- You okay?
- He's gonna kill him.

47:17.668 --> 47:18.838
- No!
- Wait! Wait... here.

47:19.045 --> 47:20.045
<i>Wait here!</i>

47:20.171 --> 47:21.171
Mom.

47:23.007 --> 47:24.667
Carl, stop it!
Just take it easy!

47:24.675 --> 47:27.085
Take it easy? This ain't
your motherfuckin' house!

47:29.347 --> 47:30.427
No!

47:46.739 --> 47:49.159
- Take it easy.
- Motherfucker!

47:59.794 --> 48:01.134
No!

48:03.756 --> 48:05.166
'Get "no!"

48:05.549 --> 48:06.839
I'm not through with this yet!

48:09.762 --> 48:11.222
Come <i>here!</i> Come here.

48:11.597 --> 48:13.597
<i>- What's it gonna be?
- Let me go!</i>

48:16.477 --> 48:18.517
Motherfucker!

48:21.649 --> 48:22.979
Have you lost your mind?

48:22.983 --> 48:25.033
I see you ain't the only one
need an ass-whoopin'!

48:26.112 --> 48:27.112
Bitch!

48:54.432 --> 48:57.272
This shit ain't over yet, bitch.

49:03.858 --> 49:05.278
But I think it is.

49:21.876 --> 49:23.126
What are we gonna do?

49:24.170 --> 49:26.630
<i>They find him here like this,
no one's gonna believe us.</i>

49:29.175 --> 49:30.215
Don't worry.

49:33.304 --> 49:35.684
Nobody's gonna
find out anything.

49:41.061 --> 49:43.441
Walter, you know what to do.

50:13.302 --> 50:14.432
Yes, sir...

50:15.513 --> 50:19.393
Walter... killed the monster.

50:20.768 --> 50:21.768
Hmm.

50:24.396 --> 50:26.396
Man, is that really how
he got dropped?

50:27.608 --> 50:29.228
Hey man, close this thing!

50:29.777 --> 50:30.987
Oh.

50:34.073 --> 50:35.373
What the fuck?

50:41.205 --> 50:43.955
So dead motherfuckers be
playin' with dolls now, right?

50:43.958 --> 50:46.288
Yes. But this doll...

50:46.919 --> 50:50.209
It's a way station
for lost souls.

50:50.923 --> 50:52.473
- What?
- Sometimes...

50:52.633 --> 50:55.263
When a person's body
has been through a lot...

50:56.053 --> 50:58.063
The soul is displaced.

50:59.390 --> 51:03.100
This doll is a place
for the soul to survive...

51:04.979 --> 51:06.769
Until it can move on.

51:07.398 --> 51:10.275
Man, you for real?

51:10.276 --> 51:11.486
<i>Yes!</i>

51:13.737 --> 51:15.357
I found this doll...

51:16.448 --> 51:19.368
In a house in the south.

51:20.869 --> 51:24.829
It is an amazing thing.

51:30.546 --> 51:32.626
<i>You can give it
any name you want.</i>

51:32.840 --> 51:37.260
<i>The fact is, affirmative action,
quotas, reparations...</i>

51:37.261 --> 51:39.101
<i>All mean one thing...</i>

51:40.264 --> 51:44.100
<i>Another qualified individual
won't get a job...</i>

51:44.101 --> 51:45.691
Or an education...

51:45.894 --> 51:48.944
<i>Simply because
he's not the right color.</i>

51:52.526 --> 51:55.316
<i>I thought that's what we were
trying to get away from.</i>

51:55.779 --> 51:57.409
<i>Duke Metger for governor.</i>

51:57.698 --> 51:59.368
<i>An original American.</i>

51:59.700 --> 52:01.490
<i>Isn't it about time?</i>

52:02.328 --> 52:04.908
That's great.
I'd even vote for me.

52:05.331 --> 52:07.081
Listen, by the time
I finish with you...

52:07.333 --> 52:09.671
You might even get
a few black votes in the till.

52:09.672 --> 52:11.127
Well, a start would be

52:11.128 --> 52:13.208
just getting the bastards
off my front lawn.

52:13.922 --> 52:16.382
It's startin' to look like a
damned minstrel show out there.

52:16.967 --> 52:19.717
Duke must go! Duke must go!

52:20.137 --> 52:22.557
They were as relentless
about findin' a job...

52:22.558 --> 52:23.926
As they are houndin' me...

52:24.725 --> 52:26.265
We might put an end to welfare.

52:26.602 --> 52:28.522
Duke must go! Duke must go!

52:29.813 --> 52:32.733
Duke must go! Duke must go!

52:33.067 --> 52:34.857
Beyond the obvious concern that
the black

52:34.860 --> 52:36.319
and Jewish community share...

52:36.320 --> 52:39.450
Over the candidacy of one-time
Klan member Duke Metger...

52:39.698 --> 52:41.366
There seems to be
an additional issue

52:41.367 --> 52:43.167
that has sparked anger
in the black community.

52:43.410 --> 52:45.330
Councilman Rogers,
can you explain?

52:45.663 --> 52:48.920
Loni, it's disturbing enough
that Duke Metger...

52:48.921 --> 52:50.166
Would claim residency here

52:50.167 --> 52:52.417
just for the sake
of gaining racist votes.

52:52.795 --> 52:55.755
But the real slap in the face
to the black community...

52:56.173 --> 52:59.723
Is that he chose this house...
This former plantation...

52:59.927 --> 53:02.387
With its history of racism
towards black people...

53:02.763 --> 53:03.763
To set up camp.

53:03.764 --> 53:04.847
Can anything be done?

53:04.848 --> 53:06.848
Well, there are certain things
that we plan to do.

53:06.850 --> 53:08.390
Ain't nothin' we need to do!

53:08.394 --> 53:09.522
They're gonna take care of it.

53:09.523 --> 53:10.900
They gonna make him pay
for bein' here!

53:10.901 --> 53:12.016
Who will make him pay, sir?

53:12.189 --> 53:13.898
The souls... the souls gonna
make him pay!

53:13.899 --> 53:15.169
They gonna make him pay
for bein' here.

53:15.192 --> 53:16.692
Miss Cobbs was
the keeper of the souls.

53:16.694 --> 53:17.740
And now, there's no peace.

53:17.741 --> 53:20.196
There was peace but there's
no peace in the Dollhouse now.

53:20.197 --> 53:21.656
- The Dollhouse?
- The Dollhouse!

53:21.657 --> 53:23.051
They gonna make him pay!
The Dollhouse!

53:23.075 --> 53:24.775
Just an old myth
around these parts.

53:24.785 --> 53:25.785
Ain't no myth!

53:25.828 --> 53:27.698
It ain't no myth!
It ain't no myth!

53:28.706 --> 53:30.166
It ain't no myth!

53:30.416 --> 53:32.876
Duke must go! Duke must go!

53:33.043 --> 53:34.843
Go away, old man.

53:35.838 --> 53:38.758
What is it about this house
that has them so worked up?

53:39.591 --> 53:40.881
After the civil war,

53:40.884 --> 53:42.474
the man who owned
this plantation,

53:42.761 --> 53:44.301
Nathan Wilkes, he, uh...

53:44.972 --> 53:47.772
<i>He's upset that his slaves
were gonna walk away free.</i>

53:49.309 --> 53:52.599
<i>When they tried to leave,
the old man snapped.</i>

53:53.397 --> 53:56.067
Turned into a massacre.
Hundreds of slaves.

53:56.650 --> 53:58.440
Lynchin's, burnin's.

53:59.278 --> 54:01.488
Twelve bodies hangin'
from that tree alone.

54:03.240 --> 54:05.320
Yeah, they buried 'em
in a common grave

54:05.325 --> 54:06.485
up on the hill.

54:07.619 --> 54:10.159
Now, fools believe that
their souls never rested...

54:10.164 --> 54:12.749
Till miss Cobbs,
an old voodoo woman,

54:12.750 --> 54:13.750
bought the place.

54:13.751 --> 54:16.131
That's... that's her there
in the mural.

54:16.962 --> 54:19.342
<i>- What are those?
- Dolls.</i>

54:20.048 --> 54:22.008
Legend is, she
transferred the souls

54:22.009 --> 54:23.969
of the slaves into little dolls.

54:24.928 --> 54:26.258
Negro dolls.

54:27.681 --> 54:28.681
Word is,

54:29.266 --> 54:32.266
they remain in the house
right to this day.

54:35.314 --> 54:36.734
You ever seen any of 'em?

54:37.733 --> 54:40.323
I searched every inch
of this house

54:40.652 --> 54:41.990
when I first bought the place...

54:41.991 --> 54:43.737
I figured the little
black bastards

54:43.739 --> 54:44.699
might be worth something...

54:44.700 --> 54:46.369
But no, I never found any.

54:48.076 --> 54:50.826
Now they feel that
the place should remain empty...

54:50.829 --> 54:53.369
As a... as a remembrance
to the atrocity...

54:53.665 --> 54:57.495
To let the souls rest, like a...
Like an old Nazi camp.

55:00.964 --> 55:01.964
Personally...

55:02.591 --> 55:05.591
I think the whole thing adds
to a certain Southern charm.

55:06.345 --> 55:07.885
You're a sick fuck, Duke.

55:08.096 --> 55:09.096
Uh, perhaps.

55:09.223 --> 55:10.223
But it's your job,

55:10.307 --> 55:12.677
Mr. $10,000-a-week
image maker...

55:12.684 --> 55:13.894
To change all that,

55:14.311 --> 55:16.101
to soften the hard edges.

55:16.480 --> 55:19.318
Mold me into a respected
man of the people.

55:19.319 --> 55:22.146
Well, well, I've got my work
cut out for me, don't I?

55:23.487 --> 55:25.487
You know, the first thing we're
gonna work on, Duke,

55:25.489 --> 55:27.489
is your defensive media skills.

55:27.491 --> 55:29.451
When you get out here
in front of these cameras...

55:29.618 --> 55:32.198
These reporters, making these
public appearances...

55:32.830 --> 55:34.960
You've always got to expect
the Unex...

55:44.466 --> 55:46.296
This thing's kind of creepy,
don't you think?

55:47.469 --> 55:49.138
I'm gonna paint
the whole place over

55:49.139 --> 55:50.177
after the election.

55:51.640 --> 55:53.100
Let's get you elected first,
Duke.

55:53.642 --> 55:55.022
Okay.

56:15.956 --> 56:18.576
<i>I feel I have a lot
to offer all the constituents</i>

56:18.584 --> 56:19.504
<i>of this community...</i>

56:19.505 --> 56:21.627
<i>Not just the white constituents.</i>

56:21.628 --> 56:23.838
So are you telling us, Duke,
that your former affiliation

56:23.839 --> 56:24.629
with the KKK...

56:24.840 --> 56:27.218
Is not something that the voters
should concern themselves with

56:27.219 --> 56:28.219
in this election?

56:28.844 --> 56:30.604
We all have a past now,
don't we?

56:31.430 --> 56:32.430
<i>No.</i>

56:33.515 --> 56:35.635
No, ho, no, no, "0," 0, no, no.

56:36.226 --> 56:37.386
You're being much too defensive.

56:37.394 --> 56:38.874
Looks like you have
something to hide.

56:40.188 --> 56:41.647
Look, I want you to watch me,
all right?

56:41.648 --> 56:42.648
Take the camera.

56:43.025 --> 56:45.025
I want you to film me.
All right?

56:45.027 --> 56:46.447
Hold on. Hold it, hold it.

56:46.653 --> 56:47.653
<i>Good.</i>

56:48.238 --> 56:51.198
We all... have a past.

56:52.492 --> 56:55.122
It's the better man
who can learn from his failures.

56:55.996 --> 56:57.616
I know that I've
learned from mine

56:58.165 --> 56:59.535
and I'm better for it.

56:59.541 --> 57:00.541
Uh-huh.

57:00.709 --> 57:02.289
Well, what about the house?

57:02.669 --> 57:04.999
Well, I think
that it's quite unfair

57:05.005 --> 57:06.795
to judge me or anyone else...

57:06.798 --> 57:09.088
By the misdeeds
of his ancestors.

57:09.426 --> 57:13.296
After all, I have quite a few
of my own to account for.

57:14.598 --> 57:16.598
Aren't you afraid of the dolls?

57:17.100 --> 57:18.890
What about the ghosts?

57:19.061 --> 57:22.355
Well, the only spooks
that I'm afraid of...

57:22.356 --> 57:25.186
Are the ones with guns.

57:27.069 --> 57:28.319
That's a good one, Rhodie.

57:28.320 --> 57:29.880
I like that.
I believe I'm gonna use it.

57:30.113 --> 57:33.573
Oh, no. Not if you want
to get elected, you won't.

57:33.825 --> 57:36.235
Okay? Jesus, I've been
around you too long. Okay.

57:36.244 --> 57:38.329
Look, Duke, this is
the real response

57:38.330 --> 57:39.120
to that one, okay?

57:39.331 --> 57:40.711
Oh! Oh, oh...

57:41.500 --> 57:42.500
Okay.

57:42.668 --> 57:44.748
You know, I'm not concerned
with the ghost stories.

57:44.753 --> 57:47.303
I'm concerned with traditional
American values.

57:47.464 --> 57:48.514
Original...

57:55.472 --> 57:56.512
<i>Rhodie!</i>

57:59.267 --> 58:01.347
Let us bow our heads in prayer.

58:02.145 --> 58:04.555
Unto the mercy
of almighty god...

58:05.732 --> 58:09.442
We commend the soul
of our brother departed.

58:10.112 --> 58:12.612
We commit his body
to the ground...

58:12.781 --> 58:14.321
Earth to earth...

58:14.700 --> 58:16.370
Ashes to ashes...

58:16.910 --> 58:18.330
<i>Dust to dust...</i>

58:19.162 --> 58:21.122
<i>In the sure and certain hope...</i>

58:21.581 --> 58:24.541
<i>Of the resurrection
to eternal life.</i>

58:26.962 --> 58:28.921
Any truth to the rumor
that Mr. Willis' death

58:28.922 --> 58:31.382
was the result of some
mysterious circumstances?

58:31.383 --> 58:32.933
- What about that, sir?
- No, no.

58:32.934 --> 58:35.596
It was simply
an unfortunate accident.

58:36.263 --> 58:37.423
Don't you think it would help

58:37.514 --> 58:39.223
your position
with the black community...

58:39.224 --> 58:42.274
If you simply left Wilkes manor
and found another residence?

58:42.978 --> 58:45.438
Yeah, I think it's unfair
to judge me

58:45.439 --> 58:46.519
or any other person,

58:46.523 --> 58:48.363
by the misdeeds
of their ancestors.

58:48.525 --> 58:52.895
Besides, I have many misdeeds
of my own to account for.

58:53.447 --> 58:55.027
So, you're not afraid
of the ghosts?

58:55.365 --> 58:57.235
No, the only spooks
I'm afraid of...

58:58.660 --> 59:00.620
are you spooky reporters.

59:00.996 --> 59:02.656
So, what is your real goal?

59:02.664 --> 59:04.124
That's about it, folks.
Thank you.

59:05.584 --> 59:07.344
You need to be scared,
Mr. Metger.

59:07.836 --> 59:09.166
Them souls don't want you there.

59:09.379 --> 59:12.209
They didn't want him there.
Now you best to leave...

59:12.215 --> 59:15.215
Or you'll end up
just like him, or worse.

59:15.927 --> 59:17.967
Well, sir, I have
no intention of leavin'...

59:17.971 --> 59:21.101
So let's just hope that
the house and I can get along.

59:22.017 --> 59:25.517
Can't we all just...
Get along?

59:25.729 --> 59:28.559
Heed my warning, Metger.
They don't want you there.

59:28.565 --> 59:30.565
- That's about it. Thank you.
- The dolls don't want you there!

59:30.567 --> 59:31.687
That's about it. Thank you!

59:33.028 --> 59:34.568
Go away, old fool.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.611
Do you hear me?
They want reparation!

59:38.158 --> 59:40.408
They want reparation,
Mr. Metger!

59:51.838 --> 59:53.418
Driver, who'd you
let in this vehicle?

59:53.799 --> 59:54.799
Stop the car.

59:55.092 --> 59:56.801
Stop the damn car!

59:56.802 --> 59:58.142
Goddamn it!

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.810
I let no one in the car, sir.

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.145
<i>This is
the real response to that one.</i>

01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:14.069
<i>Okay?</i>

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:16.030
<i>- Here we go, all right.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:17.446

to give me a call.

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:32.773
There's somethin' wrong here.

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:37.735
Bruce! Janet! You back?

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.200

You think you
and some old voodoo bitch

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:27.405
could scare me out of my house?

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:30.535
I don't care how many slaves
died here.

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:32.367
I didn't kill 'em.

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:37.592
You get no reparations.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:39.255

01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:22.983
Saved by the motherfuckin' cops.

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:25.441
Damn.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:31.816
Oh, fuck.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.992
Read me the summary on this one.

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:37.621
Uh..."Jerome Johns,
serving the fourth year...

01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:40.002
"Of a life sentence
without a possibility of parole.

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:42.498
"Solitary confinement
the last two years

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:43.921
"for assaults on
other prisoners.

01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:46.962
"Previous arrests
and convictions included, uh...

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.510
"Aggravated assault,
first degree battery...

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:52.635
Suspicion of murder three times,
aggravated mayhem."

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:53.637
Jerome!

01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:56.386
<i>Jerome?</i>

01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:01.904
How would you like
to be released from prison?

01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:04.573
Man, is you fuckin'
with my mind, or what?

01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:06.439
How that shit gonna happen?

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.110
Consent
to behavioral modification...

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:11.792
And you'll be out on the street
in no time.

01:14:16.327 --> 01:14:19.037
- Yo, let's do this.
- Yo, let's.

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.124
He'll do.

01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:25.964
- Prepare him for transfer.
- Okay.

01:15:40.828 --> 01:15:42.408
Get the fuck off me, man!

01:15:43.289 --> 01:15:44.329
Shit!

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:53.087
Well, look what we have here.

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:57.636
The first soldier
in my army, perhaps.

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:14.443
So you're a real
bad-ass spade, huh?

01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:16.282
What'd you say to me,
motherfucker?

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:18.072
You heard me.

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:22.541
You gotta be really bad
to be in a place like this.

01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:24.753
Otherwise you wouldn't be here.
So what'd you do?

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:26.621
What you in for?

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:27.624
Murder, punk!

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:29.627
And I wouldn't mind
doin' the shit again.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:33.710
Me either.

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:38.389
I killed a lot of people.
You wanna know what kind?

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:40.775
Come over here.
I wanna show you somethin'.

01:16:42.515 --> 01:16:45.305
What's wrong?
Are you afraid of me?

01:17:00.366 --> 01:17:03.906
The final fight between
black and white has begun.

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:07.705
I've led my troops
on a wave of assaults...

01:17:07.706 --> 01:17:09.576
To wake up my white brother.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:13.962
All... of the niggers
of the earth will be killed...

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:17.090
<i>Except for the few that helped
with the fight against...</i>

01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:19.091
Their mud-souled brethren.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.760
Those few will be spared...

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:24.514
And live their lives as slaves.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:28.601
Do you... wanna be spared?

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:31.522
<i>Come join my army.</i>

01:17:40.865 --> 01:17:43.445
Hey, nigger,
those guys you killed...

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.290
What color were they?

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:48.037
<i>Huh?</i>

01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:54.630
They were niggers.

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:57.461
<i>I know it.</i>

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.298
You're cool with me, nigger.

01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:07.523
<i>I like you.
I like you a lot.</i>

01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:16.185
Yeah, I didn't like bein'
put in there

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:17.942
with that crazy
Klan motherfucker, either.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:20.028
<i>I purposely put you
next to him, Jerome,</i>

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:22.069
<i>because I thought he was
someone you ought to meet.</i>

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:24.531
You are here
to be rehabilitated...

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:27.990
By a process that the government
has paid me to develop.

01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:30.869
If you successfully
complete this project...

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:33.383
There's a very good chance
you might be released.

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:37.046
If you don't, you will rot
in solitary confinement...

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:38.883
For the rest
of your wasted life.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:43.433
And it wouldn't
bother me a bit...

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.971
'Cause I think
you're scum, Jerome.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.808
So don't test me.
You understand?

01:18:57.608 --> 01:19:00.238
Our tests show
you have a high IQ.

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:03.201
Have you ever been
interested in science?

01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:05.910
Yeah. I sold a few
chemicals in my day.

01:19:08.202 --> 01:19:09.120
Wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa.

01:19:09.121 --> 01:19:11.041
I know you don't think
I'm gettin' on that thing.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.540
You have no other choice.

01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:39.524
Fuck!

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:44.741
Come on, man!
Shit!

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:06.971
[Gagging 1

01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:21.569
I'll break your fuckin' neck

01:20:21.775 --> 01:20:23.225
when I get out
this motherfucker!

01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:28.784
[Gagging 1

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:34.785
I don't think so.

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:51.470
Motherfucker!

01:21:15.412 --> 01:21:17.542
Start the optical sequences.

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:22.881
Jerome, I want you to take
a little look at something.

01:22:45.878 --> 01:22:47.958
What's wrong, Jerome?

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:51.301
You don't like seein'
black people get killed?

01:22:51.842 --> 01:22:55.432
<i>But isn't that what you've been
doin' all your life, Jerome?</i>

01:22:55.596 --> 01:22:57.506
You know, Jerome...

01:22:57.890 --> 01:23:01.480
<i>Cain was the world's
first murderer.</i>

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.767
<i>He slayed his brother!</i>

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:06.983
And how many brothers
have you slain?

01:24:00.619 --> 01:24:01.699
Sensory what?

01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:04.119
<i>Sensory deprivation chamber.</i>

01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:07.125
You will see nothing.
You will hear nothing.

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:11.089
<i>Your mind will have nothing
to feed upon but itself.</i>

01:24:12.339 --> 01:24:14.379
It's a tiny meal, indeed.

01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:46.042
<i>What's up, crazy K?
Remember me?</i>

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:48.749
Tracy?

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.540
Yeah, man.
What's up?

01:24:50.544 --> 01:24:52.254
How come we ain't talked
in a long time?

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:56.510
That's right. You killed my ass!
Ain't that a bitch?

01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:00.100
I got one question
for you, crazy K.

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:02.179
Why?

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:04.932
Why?

01:25:06.476 --> 01:25:09.346
Y... you was comin' up short
all the time, man.

01:25:10.397 --> 01:25:12.607
I... I couldn't just let you
rip me off, nigger.

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:16.780
You didn't even know us.

01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:18.527
That shit was wrong, man.

01:25:18.739 --> 01:25:20.869
Just drove by
and started blastin'.

01:25:21.283 --> 01:25:23.243
That shit was wrong, man.

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:25.790
We ain't even the ones
that capped your homey.

01:25:26.163 --> 01:25:28.333
That shit was really wrong, G.

01:25:29.333 --> 01:25:30.833
Man, fuck you, niggers!

01:25:31.251 --> 01:25:33.381
It was your set
that did my homey, little Joe!

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.500
Y'all motherfuckers would've
tried to kill me

01:25:35.505 --> 01:25:36.505
if you had the chance!

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:38.882
Man, fuck you, niggers!
Fuck y'all!

01:25:41.887 --> 01:25:43.807
I didn't do anything.

01:25:44.931 --> 01:25:46.471
I was playing in my room,

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:49.018
and the bullet from your gun
came through the wall.

01:25:50.729 --> 01:25:54.269
A... a bullet ain't got
no name on it.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:56.900
Y... you was just
at the wrong place

01:25:56.902 --> 01:25:57.902
at the wrong time.

01:26:13.877 --> 01:26:16.457
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

01:26:16.463 --> 01:26:17.672
Why should they, Jerome?

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:19.763
Are they saying something
you don't want to hear?

01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:22.008
So you gonna blame
all this shit on me?

01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:26.381
You tryin' to make me crazy
or somethin', motherfucker?

01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:28.102
Huh?

01:26:28.103 --> 01:26:30.600
I don't owe no responsibilities
for these motherfuckers.

01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:34.311
But you are responsible
for the lives you've taken...

01:26:34.648 --> 01:26:36.978
For the dreams
you've turned into nightmares.

01:26:37.442 --> 01:26:38.782
Nightmares?

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:41.364
Motherfucker,
what about my nightmare?

01:26:42.572 --> 01:26:44.952
What about the nightmare
I lived in?

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:47.987
What about the nightmare I
lived in ever since

01:26:47.994 --> 01:26:49.582
I was born
into this motherfucker?

01:26:49.583 --> 01:26:51.038
Who's responsible for that?

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:53.209
I don't know, Jerome.
You tell me.

01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:56.502
Who is responsible?
Your mother? Your father?

01:26:56.753 --> 01:26:59.630
Your teachers?
The world? Who?

01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:00.631
Yeah, that's right.

01:27:00.632 --> 01:27:02.682
All of those motherfuckers,
'cause they created me.

01:27:03.009 --> 01:27:04.679
So now I'm
the motherfuckin' nightmare!

01:27:05.011 --> 01:27:08.061
The nightmare ends
when you say it does, Jerome.

01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:11.604
You've got to take
responsibility to wake up!

01:27:12.018 --> 01:27:13.518
You've got to
take responsibility

01:27:13.687 --> 01:27:15.187
to break this chain!

01:27:16.982 --> 01:27:19.112
I got one motherfuckin'
responsibility in this world,

01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:19.897
and that's me.

01:27:19.901 --> 01:27:21.281
And that's it, motherfucker!

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:25.032
So anybody and everything
that ain't me, ain't shit!

01:27:25.033 --> 01:27:26.121
Do you understand that?

01:27:26.992 --> 01:27:29.622
That's a question
best posed to yourself.

01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:32.122
I'm givin' you a chance.

01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:35.081
I'm givin' you
a shot at redemption!

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:36.543
<i>Do you understand that?</i>

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:39.382
I don't give a fuck about none
of you stupid motherfuckers!

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:43.682
So what you do is stop
fuckin' with my mind, man...

01:27:43.842 --> 01:27:45.762
And let me up out
of this motherfucker!

01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:51.679
There's nothing
to stop you, Jerome.

01:27:55.312 --> 01:27:56.272
Jerome!

01:27:56.273 --> 01:27:57.652
Shut the fuck up!
Shut up!

01:27:58.648 --> 01:27:59.978
Let me up out
of this motherfucker

01:27:59.983 --> 01:28:01.901
or I swear to god
I'll snap this bitch's neck!

01:28:01.902 --> 01:28:03.452
Jerome, it's not too late
to be saved.

01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:05.529
<i>You won't get another chance.</i>

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:07.240
I don't need another
motherfuckin' chance.

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:09.529
You know why?
'Cause I don't give a fuck.

01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:11.660
I said, I don't give a fuck.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.160
I don't give a fuck!

01:28:13.163 --> 01:28:15.001
- Jerome!
- I don't give a fuck!

01:28:15.002 --> 01:28:16.788
<i>I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!</i>

01:28:17.083 --> 01:28:19.093
<i>I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!</i>

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:20.304
I don't give a fuck!

01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:22.342
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!

01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:23.714
I don't give a fuck!

01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:24.800
I don't...

01:28:24.801 --> 01:28:26.401
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck!

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:27.840
I don't give a fuck!

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.796
We don't give a fuck either,
motherfucker!

01:28:39.105 --> 01:28:40.265
Oh, I must say.

01:28:40.816 --> 01:28:43.146
I don't think you can
rehabilitate those types.

01:28:43.443 --> 01:28:46.033
No. You just kill them.

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:49.198
Who you think
you're fuckin' with, old man?

01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:50.119
What?

01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:51.697
Yeah, cap this fool.

01:28:51.701 --> 01:28:52.991
What? What?

01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:54.538
You know what!

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.670
Dude, I'm just sick of playin'
this ring-around-the-rosies.

01:28:58.416 --> 01:29:00.326
- Now, that last little story?
- Mm-hmm?

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:01.665
That shit wasn't funny.

01:29:01.878 --> 01:29:04.708
Yeah, what you gonna do?
Call the cops or some shit?

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:09.092
Now, why...

01:29:10.262 --> 01:29:11.722
Would I do that?

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:14.180
'Cause you know who it was
that killed the nigger

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:15.602
and you ain't said shit.

01:29:17.561 --> 01:29:20.611
