00:01.202 --> 00:02.301
Rocsi:
<i> Tonight...</i>

00:02.336 --> 00:04.003
I'm not your typical
country singer.

00:04.038 --> 00:06.605
<i> The "alter ego" auditions</i>
<i> come to a close...</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:11.510
I need my alter ego
to prove that I can make it
in the music industry.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.345
<i> ...With only</i>
<i> four spots remaining.</i>

00:13.381 --> 00:14.813
Is your hair the ocean?

00:14.882 --> 00:16.582
Yeah, I just prefer
a wavy look.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.384
- Hey!
- That's your humor.

00:18.419 --> 00:21.587
I like this girl.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.223
<i> Each singer and their</i>
<i> customized alter ego</i>

00:24.258 --> 00:25.924
<i> will sing live backstage</i>

00:25.960 --> 00:28.460
<i> as their alter egos perform</i>
<i> live onstage...</i>

00:28.496 --> 00:30.796
That is freaking
super crazy impressive.

00:30.831 --> 00:33.766
<i> ...For the grand prize</i>
<i> of $100,000</i>

00:33.801 --> 00:35.834
<i> and the opportunity</i>
<i> to be mentored</i>

00:35.870 --> 00:37.903
<i> by our superstar</i>
<i> judge panel.</i>

00:37.972 --> 00:41.273
I think we can all sense
that you've had some
frustration in your journey.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.242
I just want to say
thank goodness,

00:43.277 --> 00:45.277
because it brought
you here to our stage.

00:45.312 --> 00:47.312
<i> Who will get the chance</i>
<i> to become</i>

00:47.348 --> 00:51.517
<i> the first digital superstar</i>
<i> of our next generation?</i>

00:51.552 --> 00:52.885
<i> This is...</i>

00:52.920 --> 00:54.353
<i> "alter ego."</i>

00:56.757 --> 00:58.924
welcome to "alter ego."

00:58.959 --> 01:01.260
I'm your host rocsi diaz.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.429
It's the last night
of auditions.

01:03.464 --> 01:06.398
Next week, we start
the head-to-heads.

01:06.467 --> 01:11.136
And we truly would be nothing
without our spectacular judges--

01:11.205 --> 01:16.675
musician, producer, and tech
entrepreneur will.I.Am;

01:16.710 --> 01:20.212
legendary artist
alanis morissette;

01:20.281 --> 01:24.917
producer, singer, songwriter,
and innovator grimes;

01:24.952 --> 01:27.219
actor, singer, host
nick lachey.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.855
What's up?

01:29.924 --> 01:31.857
It's time to meet
our first alter ego.

01:31.926 --> 01:34.593
- It's orlando deville.
- Let's do it.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.069
Nick: Oh!

01:45.840 --> 01:46.905
I like the pants.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.676
Whoo!

01:50.711 --> 01:53.112
- All right.
- Orlando: Hello, everybody.

01:53.147 --> 01:57.116
Hello! What is up, everybody?

01:57.151 --> 01:58.684
Look at the technology.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.186
That is freaking
super crazy impressive.

02:01.222 --> 02:04.490
I mean, this is
a lot of live rendering.
Like, this is crazy.

02:04.558 --> 02:08.694
Oh, that is
an absolutely world-class
audience right there.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.530
- Dang. Hello, judges.
- Nick: What's up?

02:11.599 --> 02:14.266
Can I just say real quick,
mr. Lachey,

02:14.268 --> 02:15.667
you look fantastic.

02:15.669 --> 02:19.938
You have looked 25 years old
for 25 years, man.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.540
I appreciate that, my man.
Thank you.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.942
- Yeah.
- Why is your hair gold?

02:23.978 --> 02:27.713
Well, the hair is gold,
also the whole skin is gold,

02:27.748 --> 02:29.181
because I'm 24 karat.

02:29.216 --> 02:32.484
- Don't call me plated.
- Don't call you 18 karat.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.619
No, no, no, no, no.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.587
I'm just curious,
what makes you believe

02:35.589 --> 02:36.922
that you've got what it takes

02:36.957 --> 02:39.525
to be a next-generation
superstar?

02:39.560 --> 02:42.060
I believe
that I've got a gift.

02:42.096 --> 02:45.764
I've been told my whole life
that I've got a voice for soul

02:45.799 --> 02:47.466
but a face
made for tech support.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.269
Oh, my-- it's it hot.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.408
Chase:
Let's be honest, if I looked
like justin timberlake,

02:56.443 --> 02:58.076
I wouldn't be here.

02:58.078 --> 02:59.711
I've never been cool.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.547
I've never been
the kind of guy

03:01.582 --> 03:04.616
that's smooth and articulate.

03:04.652 --> 03:07.352
But this guy did land himself
a beautiful wife.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.888
- You may kiss the bride.
- ( crowd cheering )

03:09.957 --> 03:13.025
and she's like,
"you go follow your music.
I believe in you."

03:13.060 --> 03:17.663
my alter ego
is orlando deville.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.498
How's it going, ladies?

03:19.533 --> 03:24.670
My alter ego
is going to truly be,
for the first time,

03:24.672 --> 03:28.273
a character built around
my actual singing voice.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.911
That is rad.

03:32.947 --> 03:36.148
I get to watch my character
come to life

03:36.183 --> 03:38.617
as I'm giving it life.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.753
This alter ego
is gonna be me, 100%.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.823
The only difference is
it will have a jaw line.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.392
<i> ♪ ooh, when I look</i>
<i> in the mirror ♪</i>

03:47.428 --> 03:49.962

03:49.997 --> 03:53.232
- Can you change clothes?
- How's this?

03:53.267 --> 03:56.235
That is cool!

03:58.439 --> 04:00.505
( vocalizes )

04:00.541 --> 04:05.277
I am absolutely going to play
to my character's confidence.

04:05.312 --> 04:08.347
My only danger is I might
play to it too much.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.983
Hands down, my alter ego's
cooler than me.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.384

I'm feeling as bright

05:48.816 --> 05:50.749
as the surface of the sun
right now, rocsi.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.285
I love it. You look great.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.786
Alanis, what did you think?

05:54.822 --> 05:57.789
I loved how you moved.
Your voice is gorgeous.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.324
Yeah, it was super charismatic

05:59.360 --> 06:01.693
and a little cocky
in a great way.

06:01.729 --> 06:05.163
I really believed you
as an alter ego.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.766
I would absolutely
go to see you sing anywhere

06:07.835 --> 06:10.669
if I could just watch
a whole concert of yours.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.538
All right,
thank you very much.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.742
Weirdly, you have
fortnite energy.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.176
( stammers )

06:18.212 --> 06:19.344
which is good,
which is good.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.246
I felt like I was in one
of those weird concerts

06:21.315 --> 06:22.247
that happens in fortnite.

06:22.316 --> 06:23.415
They have concerts
in fortnite?

06:23.450 --> 06:25.584
- Yeah. They're ridiculous.
- Yeah.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.452
Yeah.

06:27.488 --> 06:28.620
And you aged yourself, nick.

06:28.622 --> 06:31.022
Oh, I'm so old.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.658
I love those concerts,
so that's a compliment.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.260
Alanis: That's good.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.264
I like what you did
in terms of making
it your own.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.632
I really felt like
as I watched you perform,

06:40.667 --> 06:44.669
I believed
that orlando deville
was the performer

06:44.705 --> 06:48.473
I was watching onstage
rocking out to "I wish."

06:48.509 --> 06:52.110
orlando, why do you need
an alter ego?

06:52.146 --> 06:53.779
I've been singing
ever since I was born.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.148
I've got the vibe,
I've got the soul,

06:56.183 --> 06:57.549
I've got the spirit.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.751
But when it comes down to it,
this alter ego...

06:59.787 --> 07:02.254
- Yeah?
- ...This is the last piece
of the puzzle,

07:02.256 --> 07:07.559
- and I am thrilled
to get to do it.
- Nice.

07:07.628 --> 07:12.898
Well, orlando,
since you are tonight's
first audition,

07:12.933 --> 07:16.835
you will go ahead
and take the spot
on the diamond.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.670
Yeah!

07:20.073 --> 07:21.706
The alter ego that's
standing on the diamond

07:21.742 --> 07:25.343
at the end of the show
automatically moves on
to the head-to-head.

07:25.379 --> 07:26.812
So, good luck to you,
orlando.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.216
And we're just
getting started tonight.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.218
We have four more singers
backstage

07:33.253 --> 07:34.419
waiting to audition for us.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.621
It's all coming up
after this.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.226
Grimes:
He was really likeable.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.327
At first I was like, "uh..."

07:42.396 --> 07:43.328
but then I was like,
actually, this guy's

07:43.397 --> 07:45.464
- kind of pretty nice.
- Yeah.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.869
( vocalizing )

07:50.904 --> 07:54.105
that was one the best
vocal performances
I've ever seen in my life.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.541
No matter where
you come from, what color,

07:56.577 --> 07:58.076
you can be whatever
you want to be.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.845
I never had role models

07:59.880 --> 08:02.013
that looked like
or acted like me.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.149
I never thought I was
gonna crush over no fairy.

08:05.419 --> 08:08.520
Rocsi:
Only four alter egos
can move on,

08:08.589 --> 08:10.889
and the identity of
one of them will be revealed.

08:10.924 --> 08:11.923
I feel good!

08:17.431 --> 08:19.898
<i> Here we go, folks.</i>
<i> Places, everybody.</i>

08:19.900 --> 08:24.102
<i> Orlando is on the diamond.</i>
<i> In three, two, one.</i>

08:30.077 --> 08:31.543
Welcome back to "alter ego,"

08:31.545 --> 08:33.712
the competition
where unlikely singers

08:33.747 --> 08:35.614
get a second chance
at stardom.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.550
But as the judges
are well aware,

08:38.585 --> 08:42.621
they do not get to know
anything about the real
identities of these singers.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.022
But you at home do.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.192
It's time for you guys
to meet the next alter ego.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.660
It's fern.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.398
I've been performing
for a while,

08:53.433 --> 08:55.400
but I do get still stage fright
from time to time.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.802
<i> ♪ I find my way</i>
<i> through the darkness ♪</i>

08:57.838 --> 08:59.671
the negative thoughts
will creep in,

08:59.706 --> 09:02.607
but then I try and be rational,
take some deep breaths,

09:02.643 --> 09:06.711
remind myself that this--
that this is what I love to do.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.681
I think "alter ego"
would be good for me because
I have tourette syndrome.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.684
<i> ♪ you gotta take it</i>
<i> day by day ♪</i>

09:12.753 --> 09:14.286
my name is mia cherise hall,
I'm 18 years old,

09:14.321 --> 09:15.520
and I'm from rochester,
new york.

09:15.589 --> 09:18.223
<i> ♪ when no matter</i>
<i> what they say ♪</i>

09:18.258 --> 09:20.225
I recently have been diagnosed,

09:20.260 --> 09:23.528
so coming to terms
with that as a performer
has been a journey for me.

09:23.564 --> 09:26.231
<i> ♪ keep pushing through 'em</i>
<i> 'cause there ain't</i>
<i> no other way ♪</i>

09:26.266 --> 09:28.967
people with tourette's
usually have both
vocal and motor tics.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.736
My vocal tics are often things
like little squeaks,

09:31.772 --> 09:34.072
and then motor tics,
which are, like, the head jerks

09:34.107 --> 09:36.141
and the flailing
of the arms.

09:36.143 --> 09:39.311
- <i> ♪ stronger, stronger  </i>
- since the judges
will not know who I am,

09:39.346 --> 09:41.012
I'm really glad
that I won't be judged

09:41.048 --> 09:42.814
in that way while
I'm performing.

09:42.849 --> 09:45.984
<i> ♪ take it day by day </i>

09:46.019 --> 09:47.419
my alter ego,
her name is fern,

09:47.454 --> 09:49.287
um, and she is, like, a fairy.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.556
Oh, my god.
She's so cute!

09:51.592 --> 09:53.792
- I would like fern to fly.
- How's this?

09:53.827 --> 09:56.094
Oh, my god.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.296
( gasps )
that's sick!

09:58.332 --> 10:00.865
Something that I would like
fern to have specifically

10:00.867 --> 10:02.334
is, like,
a huge stage presence.

10:02.402 --> 10:06.037
In real life,
I tend to be more
of a meek person,

10:06.073 --> 10:08.173
and I really wanted fern
to represent the opposite

10:08.241 --> 10:10.375
of that and just be
loud and proud all the time.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.110
( vocalizing )

10:12.145 --> 10:15.146
to win "alter ego"
would be a love letter

10:15.148 --> 10:17.949
to all of, like,
the people with tourette's
who want to perform.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.552
Mia is ready
to spread her wings

10:20.554 --> 10:22.554
and fern's gonna
take the voice

10:22.589 --> 10:25.924
and help me share it
to the world.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.402
- Nick: Yep! All right.
- Grimes: Yeah!

10:41.341 --> 10:47.045
- Wow, sick.
- Oh, my goodness.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.347
I just noticed, like,
how her wings

10:49.383 --> 10:50.582
aren't just moving,
they're, like, bending.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.051
- Alanis: Beautiful.
- Yeah, just the details,

10:53.086 --> 10:56.221
like the iridescent wings
and your pigtails.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.723
- You like 'em?
- Yeah, they're hot.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.059
Thank you!
It's my favorite hair style.

11:01.061 --> 11:04.496
This is, like, super sick.
Why are you here?

11:04.531 --> 11:07.332
I love the idea
of my voice being first,

11:07.401 --> 11:09.934
not anything about me
externally.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.104
A lot of humans judge me
before they even get
the chance to hear me sing.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.874
Being a part of "alter ego"
is so important to me

11:15.909 --> 11:18.877
because growing up,
I never had role models on tv

11:18.912 --> 11:20.879
that looked like me
or acted like me,

11:20.914 --> 11:22.947
and I would love to be that
for other young artists.

11:25.552 --> 11:29.120
I can't wait to meet you
because I have no idea
what you're talking about.

11:30.624 --> 11:32.057
All right, fern,
are you ready to sing for us?

11:32.125 --> 11:33.625
Absolutely.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.431
Yeah!

11:47.207 --> 11:50.141
♪ you're the light,
you're the night ♪

11:50.210 --> 11:52.610

13:25.939 --> 13:27.705
Thank you.

13:27.707 --> 13:30.909
Yeah, that was incredible.
Your voice--

13:30.944 --> 13:32.744
you were singing
more quietly and your voice
had more character,

13:32.779 --> 13:35.713
and I was actually like, wow,
your voice is pretty unique.

13:35.749 --> 13:38.616
In my mind,
I felt like your voice
was gonna be daintier,

13:38.685 --> 13:39.684
you know what I mean?

13:39.719 --> 13:40.852
I guess it's
the fairy part of it.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.187
You were a little more
powerful vocally

13:42.222 --> 13:44.389
that I was maybe ready for
or expected.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.357
I can hear the potential
in your voice

13:46.393 --> 13:50.628
and that's just gonna
get better and better
and better, so good job.

13:50.664 --> 13:54.899
Rocsi:
But now the judges have to
decide if your performance

13:54.968 --> 13:59.070
was good enough to take
orlando deville's place
on the diamond,

13:59.105 --> 14:02.807
where he's currently
safe from elimination.

14:02.876 --> 14:05.944
Judges, it's time
to make your decision.

14:05.979 --> 14:09.013
I think that's
the coolest thing we've seen.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.549
Like, the flying
was super sick.

14:11.585 --> 14:12.851
I think that's kind of
why we're here

14:12.919 --> 14:14.452
is, like, doing
the inhuman things

14:14.487 --> 14:16.020
that, like, you can't do
in the real world.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.590
And I'd put fern
on the diamond just because

14:18.625 --> 14:20.425
this is such an awesome
alter ego.

14:20.427 --> 14:23.428
I feel like you have
what it takes to be the next
digital superstar.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.396
Thank you.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.732
That moment in the song
was really, really, really dope,

14:27.801 --> 14:29.667
when all of a sudden
you just take flight and--

14:29.703 --> 14:31.402
- oh, you're doing it--
- what the what?

14:31.438 --> 14:34.505
You just do it on--
you just do it on cue!

14:34.541 --> 14:38.276
And, look, our job
is to look for the next
generation's superstar,

14:38.311 --> 14:40.945
and you certainly have
that package.

14:40.981 --> 14:44.015
But to me,
I thought that orlando

14:44.084 --> 14:47.185
was just a notch above
in terms of his
vocal performance,

14:47.220 --> 14:51.189
and so I'm gonna vote to keep
orlando on the diamond.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.859
Fern, for me, it's always
been a challenge to flip

14:54.895 --> 14:58.396
between falsetto and head voice,
as it's sometimes called.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.899
- Yeah.
- I really love when
a vocalist does both,

15:00.967 --> 15:02.700
and you did it.

15:02.702 --> 15:06.337
So I am going
to gently but swiftly

15:06.373 --> 15:08.940
ask you to jump on that diamond
in lieu of orlando.

15:08.975 --> 15:12.010
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Sorry, orlando.

15:12.078 --> 15:15.713
Okay, here we are. 2-1.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.749
It could go either way. Will?

15:17.784 --> 15:19.150
Um...

15:19.185 --> 15:21.419
Uh-oh, the glasses came off.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.221
It's getting serious.

15:23.223 --> 15:26.758
So, orlando, you sang
stevie's song awesome.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.827
The alter ego
is designed spectacular.

15:29.863 --> 15:34.699
Fern, she sang
ellie goulding magically

15:34.734 --> 15:37.869
and the alter ego
is hypnotizing.

15:37.871 --> 15:39.671
But this show is
about the marriage

15:39.706 --> 15:41.839
between the person
in the booth

15:41.875 --> 15:45.777
and the artwork called
the alter ego.

15:45.845 --> 15:50.181
And because of that,
fern's earned her chance

15:50.216 --> 15:53.785
- to burn on the diamond.
- Thank you so much!

15:53.820 --> 15:57.588
Congratulations to you, fern.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.458
Please take your place
up on the diamond.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.963
Now, remember, the alter ego
that is still standing

16:05.031 --> 16:06.764
on the diamond
at the end of the night

16:06.833 --> 16:10.501
is guaranteed a place
in the next round,
the head-to-head.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.741
<i> Our next alter ego</i>
<i> is in position.</i>

16:20.347 --> 16:22.447
<i> All right, siren is</i>
<i> our next alter ego.</i>

16:22.515 --> 16:25.049
<i> Coming to rocsi</i>
<i> in three, two--</i>

16:25.118 --> 16:26.351
<i> open the doors.</i>

16:30.056 --> 16:32.490
Welcome back to "alter ego."

16:32.559 --> 16:35.293
our next alter ego is here
to sound off.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.728
It's siren.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.033
Whoa!

16:46.706 --> 16:48.573
Siren, how are you?

16:48.641 --> 16:50.842
I'm so good.
How are you guys?

16:50.877 --> 16:52.243
Good.
Oh, now I see the, uh--

16:52.278 --> 16:53.244
you got fins
on your wrists.

16:53.279 --> 16:55.513
- Hey!
- Amphiba-woman.

16:55.548 --> 16:56.781
Is your hair the ocean?

16:56.816 --> 16:59.517
Yes. You know, I just decided
for a wavy look.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.020
- Got my waves in there.
- Hey!

17:02.055 --> 17:04.822
- That's your humor.
- I like this girl.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.991
You two are gonna
get along famously.

17:07.027 --> 17:10.561
You think you have what it takes
to be a digital superstar?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.730
Absolutely.
I'm a warrior.

17:12.766 --> 17:15.967
I'm a fighter,
so I'm here for it.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.469
I would say,
for the most part,

17:18.505 --> 17:21.072
the music business
is very looks-based,

17:21.107 --> 17:24.342
so I don't really
fit into the standard

17:24.344 --> 17:26.978
of what people
are really looking for.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.780
I am mama yaya,

17:28.815 --> 17:31.416
I am 30 years old,
and I'm from chicago, illinois.

17:31.451 --> 17:34.185
So, I dealt with
a lot of insecurities

17:34.187 --> 17:37.188
and negativity and rejection
in my music career.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.190
This is such a huge
opportunity for me,

17:39.225 --> 17:43.428
just because I get
to prioritize my voice.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.662
Rather than have to worry
about being judged

17:44.697 --> 17:46.397
or worrying about
what I look like,

17:46.433 --> 17:50.468
I can really focus
on my craft and deliver.

17:50.503 --> 17:54.839
My alter ego is siren.
She's an underwater goddess.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.075
I really wanted siren
to have a bold look.

17:57.110 --> 18:01.779
- She's a very strong spirit.
- Oh, my gosh.

18:01.815 --> 18:03.414
I love her!

18:03.450 --> 18:05.616
Can we do anything with,
like, her hair, like--

18:05.652 --> 18:07.218
oh, my gosh.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.854
Siren is definitely
not my body type.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.055
There's a part of me
that kind of likes that,

18:11.057 --> 18:14.292
where it sort
of tricks the judges.

18:14.327 --> 18:17.528
Because what
a siren is known for
is she will lure you in.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.863
She'll make you think
that she's really cute,

18:18.898 --> 18:21.699
and then she will--
she'll get ya.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.536
Give her, like,
a little extra pizzazz.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.705
The idea that this show has

18:27.707 --> 18:32.743
where I can really have space
to just do what I do

18:32.745 --> 18:34.145
rather than worrying
about what I look like,

18:34.147 --> 18:37.181
I just feel like this is
my last chance at stardom.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.917
I got a good feeling.

20:33.766 --> 20:38.069
Siren, that was amazing.
Oh, my goodness.

20:38.104 --> 20:41.105
You had a standing ovation
from our judges.

20:41.140 --> 20:45.209
Oh, my gosh.
I'm feeling good.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.311
I think you put a spell
on everybody in this room.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.146
It was-- it was phenomenal.

20:51.951 --> 20:55.920
I think we can all sense
that you've had some frustration
in your journey,

20:55.955 --> 20:57.989
and I just want to say
thank goodness,

20:58.024 --> 20:59.357
because it brought you
here to our stage...

20:59.359 --> 21:04.061
- ( squeals )
- ...And we got to enjoy that.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.497
When you were singing,
I just saw you painting.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.299
You know, you were like
there in that corner

21:08.334 --> 21:10.067
and up here, and then
I'm gonna slide around back.

21:10.069 --> 21:15.306
And it just seemed so graceful
and organic and sensual.

21:15.341 --> 21:18.509
Um, so that was
amazing to behold.

21:18.511 --> 21:22.747
But was your performance worthy

21:22.782 --> 21:25.349
of that spot on the diamond?

21:25.351 --> 21:28.185
Judges, it's time
for you guys to vote.

21:31.791 --> 21:35.026
Crowd:
Siren! Siren! Siren!

21:35.028 --> 21:36.961
I can't!

21:36.996 --> 21:40.464
Alanis, would you put siren
on the diamond?

21:40.500 --> 21:43.901
Fern, I love your vocal acuity,
and your performance.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.069
I loved it.

21:45.104 --> 21:49.473
And that said,
siren's vocals were like paint,

21:49.509 --> 21:50.908
which is breathtaking
and unique.

21:50.943 --> 21:54.078
So I'm gonna put siren up there
on that diamond.

21:56.949 --> 21:57.982
Grimes?

21:58.051 --> 22:00.751
So, that was just, like,

22:00.787 --> 22:01.819
the performance
of a lifetime.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.354
But, fern, I do not think

22:03.389 --> 22:06.023
you're going to get
eliminated today at all.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.859
I'm going to put siren
on the diamond,

22:08.861 --> 22:11.729
but I think you guys
are both awesome.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.731
That's two votes right there.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.934
Who deserves to be up there
on the diamond. Will?

22:17.003 --> 22:19.136
Fern, I never thought

22:19.205 --> 22:22.606
I was gonna, like,
crush over no fairy.

22:22.642 --> 22:23.674
You know what I'm saying?

22:23.710 --> 22:26.110
Those were my first crushes.
Fairies.

22:26.112 --> 22:30.548
But the vibes were pure,
sensual.

22:30.583 --> 22:31.982
It's siren.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.518
Oh, my goodness.

22:34.554 --> 22:37.188
That is three votes for siren,

22:37.223 --> 22:41.292
which means, siren,
you will be heading up
on that diamond.

22:41.361 --> 22:44.261
Sound the siren!
Well deserved.

22:44.297 --> 22:48.165
Amazing performance.

22:48.201 --> 22:49.767
More singers,
their alter egos,

22:49.802 --> 22:51.302
and amazing performances,
up next.

22:54.874 --> 22:58.008
I hope somebody disappears
or just changes color.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.678
- The ante is up.
- Next level.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.926
Welcome back to "alter ego."

23:15.995 --> 23:18.229
I'm gonna show everyone
else at home

23:18.264 --> 23:20.664
who is behind
our next alter ego.

23:20.666 --> 23:21.999
It's wylie.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.804
I'm not your typical
country singer.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.074
I feel like I could be
that role model

23:30.109 --> 23:31.742
to show people no matter where
you come from, what color,

23:31.778 --> 23:34.578
you can be whatever
you want to be.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.614
My name is milton patton.
I'm 30 years old.

23:36.682 --> 23:38.816
I'm from forrest city,
arkansas.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.985
I got to singing when
I was maybe six, seven.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.988
My father, my grandfather,
they all sing.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.023
You know, they introduced me
to delta blues.

23:46.025 --> 23:48.292
That's what I grew up on.

23:48.361 --> 23:50.761
Throughout my life,
I've been, you know, presented
with a couple labels.

23:50.797 --> 23:54.165
They want me to rap,
pretty much, and I want
to keep it country.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.267
Having an alter ego,
it hides that.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.102
They don't see color.
All they hear is the music.

24:01.741 --> 24:02.940
Can we, like,
do something with his tattoos?

24:02.975 --> 24:04.875
Can you make it light up
or something like that?

24:04.911 --> 24:08.179
Heck yeah, bro!
Oh, yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.580
Yeah, he look good,
he look good.

24:09.582 --> 24:10.781
We looking good.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.150
It's a new sheriff in town.
His name is wylie.

24:13.186 --> 24:14.985
Watching it come together
was beautiful.

24:15.021 --> 24:17.288
They get it right to the t.
Everything was just perfect.

24:17.356 --> 24:19.290
When I move my lips,
wylie moves his lips.

24:19.358 --> 24:20.791
When I two-step,
so does wylie.

24:20.827 --> 24:21.992
He's gonna bring
the hips out,

24:22.028 --> 24:23.060
and the moves,
and the two-step,

24:23.095 --> 24:24.628
and the line dancing, so...

24:24.664 --> 24:27.298
♪ oh, get down, turn around

24:27.333 --> 24:29.667
I want to win "alter ego"
to give my family a better life,

24:29.669 --> 24:33.270
to say I've accomplished,
you know, something really big.

24:33.306 --> 24:35.072
Also to take back
to my home town

24:35.141 --> 24:36.841

from this small town did it.

27:15.067 --> 27:17.234
Now, before we see
what the judges think,

27:17.269 --> 27:20.638
give it up to adam blackstone
and the alter ego band.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.806
Yeah!

27:22.875 --> 27:25.309
Will: I just want
to tell you, wylie,

27:25.344 --> 27:29.313
I never thought that I would
come on this show

27:29.348 --> 27:32.616
and somebody that sounds
like my uncle

27:32.652 --> 27:34.184
is singing a country song,

27:34.186 --> 27:37.021
air humping with an avatar.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.089
I never thought
I would see it.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.557
You didn't think
that would happen?

27:40.593 --> 27:42.259
I didn't think that
would happen.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.628
Rocsi: Okay, guys,
we have to find out

27:44.664 --> 27:48.432
if it's enough to knock siren
off of the diamond.

27:48.467 --> 27:50.901
Judges, it's time to vote.

27:50.936 --> 27:53.871
- Alanis?
- Wylie, I love--

27:53.873 --> 27:55.506
actually,
person behind wylie,

27:55.508 --> 27:58.642
I love how you embody wylie.
I wasn't distracted.

27:58.678 --> 28:00.444
I wasn't thinking
about you backstage.

28:00.479 --> 28:02.413
- I was all in.
- Yeah, true.

28:02.415 --> 28:04.982
Thank you. Thank you.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.151
There were moments
where I couldn't tell

28:07.186 --> 28:09.687
whether you were really
living those lyrics.

28:09.722 --> 28:10.821
I love siren's vocal.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.256
I think it was olympian

28:12.258 --> 28:14.792
and delicious and colorful,

28:14.827 --> 28:18.295
and I am going to choose

28:18.330 --> 28:19.763
to keep you on that diamond.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.101
So, that's one vote
for siren.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.703
Will.I.Am?

28:25.738 --> 28:26.904
Well, they both were awesome.

28:26.906 --> 28:29.139
And to have to decide

28:29.141 --> 28:32.076
between two distinctly
different performers,

28:32.111 --> 28:34.712
styles, pieces of art,

28:34.747 --> 28:36.580
it's just a very
uncomfortable thing.

28:36.615 --> 28:42.019
- But I'm staying with siren.
- Rocsi: All right.

28:42.021 --> 28:46.690
That is two votes for siren.
Grimes?

28:46.759 --> 28:48.292
I think siren just gave
one of the best

28:48.360 --> 28:54.098
vocal performances
I've ever seen in my life.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.266
But your character's amazing.

28:56.302 --> 28:57.868
You know, and this is also
about trying to create

28:57.903 --> 28:59.636
a digital pop star,

28:59.672 --> 29:01.972
so I'm going to keep siren
on the diamond.

29:01.974 --> 29:05.909
Rocsi:
Okay, that is three votes.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.511
You are staying
on the diamond.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.980
Now, remember,
whoever is on the diamond

29:10.015 --> 29:11.982
after all of tonight's auditions

29:12.017 --> 29:14.451
is guaranteed a place
in the next round.

29:14.487 --> 29:17.454
Only one person
is going home tonight,

29:17.456 --> 29:19.857
so, wylie, it is not
the end of the road

29:19.892 --> 29:21.291
- for you just yet.
- It's not over.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.260
- Nick: Far from it.
- Rocsi: All right?

29:23.295 --> 29:25.262
There's only one more
audition left tonight.

29:25.297 --> 29:29.299
Will they be able to knock
siren off the diamond?

29:29.335 --> 29:32.069
More "alter ego" coming up.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.771
Do we get,
like, a bathroom break
at some point?

29:33.839 --> 29:35.606
Oh, they didn't give you
the diaper that they gave us?

29:35.674 --> 29:37.908
- You guys got diapers?
- No.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.943
- Adult diapers, don't worry.
- Alanis: Adult diapers.

29:39.979 --> 29:41.912
You know what?
Adult diapers are outselling
baby diapers in japan.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.981
Alanis: Okay.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.516
Grimes: I don't know why
I know that fact.

29:53.425 --> 29:54.625
Welcome back to "alter ego."

29:54.660 --> 29:57.194
I am your host rocsi diaz.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.663
There's only one more
audition left tonight.

29:59.665 --> 30:02.299
Just one more.
Can you believe it?

30:02.334 --> 30:03.934
And I have a feeling
she's going to make

30:04.003 --> 30:06.470
a fiery impression
on your guys.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.672
It's time to meet
phoenix embers.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.283
( blowing kisses )

30:19.318 --> 30:20.617
I seen lots of afros
in my life.

30:20.686 --> 30:24.154
I ain't never seen
no afro like that, though.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.056
Why do you want
to be a part of the show?

30:26.125 --> 30:28.325
Well, oof, first of all,

30:28.360 --> 30:30.360
am I really talking
to will.I.Am?

30:33.199 --> 30:35.098
Aah! Okay, sorry.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.401
I'll compose here.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.437
Well, for one,
this show is beautiful

30:40.472 --> 30:42.406
and about second chances,

30:42.441 --> 30:44.942
and I have three
beautiful little birdies

30:45.010 --> 30:46.510
at home, little girls.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.748
As a mother of three,
I need my alter ego

30:51.784 --> 30:54.117
to prove to myself
that I can make it

30:54.153 --> 30:57.354
in the music industry
regardless of my age.

30:57.356 --> 31:00.490
My name is danielle,
I'm 39 years old,

31:00.526 --> 31:02.459
and I am a stay at home mom.

31:02.494 --> 31:06.463
To actually let myself say,
"I want to be a singer,"

31:06.498 --> 31:08.866
like, I didn't my whole life
because that was silly.

31:08.901 --> 31:10.534
I told my husband, I said,

31:10.603 --> 31:14.104
"I think it's best
to just throw out

31:14.139 --> 31:17.841
the dreams of singing,
then I can just mom.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.309
And it'll just be good,

31:19.345 --> 31:21.478
and then I'll just mom
all the way."

31:21.513 --> 31:23.780
he said,
"that was the dumbest thing

31:23.816 --> 31:27.351
I've ever heard
in my entire life."

31:27.353 --> 31:30.587
and I lost it.
I lost it laughing.

31:30.623 --> 31:32.990
I legitimately thought
he was on board.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.324
Then it was shortly after that

31:34.360 --> 31:35.692
it just kind of
reawakened the dream

31:35.761 --> 31:37.995
and allowed me to see
both sides of the world.

31:38.030 --> 31:41.031
Oh, she's electric!

31:41.066 --> 31:44.501
The colors, the vibe,
everything is exactly
what I was wanting.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.304
When I heard that the show
was called "alter ego,"

31:47.373 --> 31:49.473
my jaw dropped.

31:49.475 --> 31:53.644
That whole idea
is allowing me to push into
who I wish to be.

31:53.679 --> 31:56.880
I find myself
aching for more musically.

31:56.916 --> 31:59.082
That is my goal,
to just break out,

31:59.118 --> 32:01.151
to be fearless in that sense.

32:01.186 --> 32:02.986
To be here right now,

32:03.022 --> 32:05.622
I am able to inspire
another mother,

32:05.658 --> 32:07.624
saying, "go for it. Do it.

32:07.660 --> 32:08.859
You've been thinking
about it this long.

32:08.894 --> 32:10.794

Phoenix,
how are you feeling?

33:52.031 --> 33:54.231
Incredibly overwhelmed,
to be honest.

33:54.266 --> 33:57.901
( sniffles )
thank you. This is insane.

33:59.405 --> 34:02.973
You know, when they first
told me about this show,

34:03.008 --> 34:06.109
I was like, "well, can you
really transmit emotion

34:06.111 --> 34:07.944
- through, you know,
an alter ego?"
- right.

34:07.980 --> 34:12.182
And this is the epitome
of that you can.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.887
You just really took it
to another level.

34:16.955 --> 34:18.255
Thank you.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.957
Phoenix ember, it's time
to see if your performance

34:20.993 --> 34:22.726
was enough to get you
on the diamond

34:22.795 --> 34:25.595
or if siren will be
the first singer

34:25.631 --> 34:27.497
to advance to the next round.

34:27.533 --> 34:30.200
Judges, what do you think?

34:30.235 --> 34:31.935
Um, both incredible,
you know.

34:32.004 --> 34:33.470
- Thank you.
- I have three kids, too,

34:33.472 --> 34:34.638
and they mean
everything to me.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.173
And I know your three girls

34:36.241 --> 34:39.109
are incredibly proud
of their mama right now.

34:39.144 --> 34:41.711
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

34:41.713 --> 34:44.614
But, siren, I mean,
you were literally mesmerizing.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.950
I found myself
just in a trance.

34:46.985 --> 34:50.987
My vote is to keep siren
on the diamond.

34:54.193 --> 34:59.429
You guys are definitely
the two strongest performances
we've seen tonight.

34:59.431 --> 35:03.266
And so I'm going to keep siren
on the diamond,

35:03.302 --> 35:06.103
but if for some reason
you end up in the bottom two,

35:06.138 --> 35:08.171
I will convince them
to keep you.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.206
So, like, you--

35:14.079 --> 35:17.314
siren is stellar,

35:17.349 --> 35:20.784
and the song that she sung
showed off every part

35:20.819 --> 35:22.619
of her vocal range.

35:22.654 --> 35:26.656
The song that phoenix sang
put her vocal range in a box,

35:26.692 --> 35:30.393
but I think there's so much more
levels to her voice.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.295
And that's the reason
why I am putting

35:32.331 --> 35:34.865
phoenix embers
on the diamond.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.000
Okay.

35:39.538 --> 35:44.574
So that's two votes for siren
and one for phoenix embers.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.942
Alanis?

35:45.978 --> 35:48.512
Phoenix embers,
I loved your performance.

35:48.547 --> 35:50.313
You added this modernization,

35:50.349 --> 35:54.784
and very 2022 of you
to sing it the way you did.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.520
Thank you.

35:56.555 --> 35:58.388
Also, I wasn't thinking

35:58.423 --> 36:00.157
about the woman
behind the curtain.

36:00.192 --> 36:03.160
I just was really beholding you
and loving this version

36:03.228 --> 36:05.495
of this gorgeous song,
so thank you.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.831
Wow, yeah.
Thank you so much.

36:07.866 --> 36:10.433
Yeah, phoenix embers
has definitely unlocked

36:10.469 --> 36:11.835
something within me, I think.

36:13.305 --> 36:17.474
That said, overall impression,
pure gut, visceral response,

36:17.509 --> 36:19.743
I want to keep siren
on that diamond.

36:22.247 --> 36:23.980
Rocsi: Okay.

36:23.982 --> 36:27.350
That is three votes
for siren.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.686
Unfortunately, phoenix embers,

36:29.755 --> 36:31.555
your performance wasn't enough

36:31.590 --> 36:34.024
to take that coveted spot
on the diamond,

36:34.059 --> 36:36.826
and that does mean
that you will move on

36:36.862 --> 36:38.295
to the studio audience vote.

36:40.499 --> 36:44.100
Now, siren was
our last singer standing
on the diamond tonight,

36:44.136 --> 36:46.937
so she will automatically
advance to the next round.

36:47.005 --> 36:49.272
Congratulations, siren.

36:49.308 --> 36:52.309
And now,
our in-studio audience

36:52.311 --> 36:55.612
will vote
their favorite alter ego.

36:55.681 --> 36:59.416
The two with the most votes
will move on.

36:59.484 --> 37:02.018
Then it's up to our judges
to decide

37:02.054 --> 37:04.321
which of the remaining two
alter egos stays in the running

37:04.389 --> 37:07.457
and who should go home.

37:07.492 --> 37:09.526
The identity of one
of our alter egos

37:09.561 --> 37:11.261
will be revealed after this.

37:11.296 --> 37:12.362
Don't go anywhere.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.570
<i> Talent, get to your marks.</i>

37:20.639 --> 37:21.905
<i> Everybody, places.</i>

37:21.940 --> 37:25.675
<i> Going to rocsi</i>
<i> in three, two, one.</i>

37:29.381 --> 37:31.381
Rocsi: Welcome back
to "alter ego."

37:31.383 --> 37:34.117
after five incredible
performances tonight,

37:34.152 --> 37:35.986
it's time for the elimination.

37:36.021 --> 37:39.155
Only four contestants remain.

37:41.827 --> 37:44.461
Our in-studio audience's votes
have been counted,

37:44.463 --> 37:48.265
and now I can reveal
that the two alter egos

37:48.300 --> 37:50.800
advancing to
the next round are...

37:58.744 --> 37:59.909
Phoenix embers.

38:06.051 --> 38:07.217
And...

38:11.423 --> 38:12.489
Fern.

38:15.661 --> 38:18.762
Thank you! Thanks so much!

38:18.830 --> 38:20.363
Congratulations, you guys.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.766
We'll see you
at the head-to-heads.

38:25.304 --> 38:28.905
That means orlando deville
and wylie,

38:28.940 --> 38:30.707
you're in the bottom two.

38:30.742 --> 38:34.411
And now it's in
your hands, judges.

38:34.479 --> 38:37.781
- ( groans )
- oh, boy.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.582
Nick:
He was pretty amazing.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.419
- He was the most
relatable alter ego.
- Alanis: Yes.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.421
Grimes: I think
I always choose the person

38:44.456 --> 38:46.189
instead of not choose
the person,

38:46.224 --> 38:47.824
because it just seems
too mean or something.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.659
- I mean, to me,
it - he's an artist.

38:49.695 --> 38:52.996
- Nick: Yeah.
- Oh, I'm really torn.

38:53.031 --> 38:56.066
It's time to make
your decision.

38:56.068 --> 38:59.202
I know this is difficult.
Judges?

38:59.237 --> 39:01.171
Alanis:
We talked about it
a lot between us

39:01.206 --> 39:05.108
and I thought, orlando,
your performance was solid

39:05.143 --> 39:08.778
and there was
a unification with music,

39:08.780 --> 39:11.481
performance,
alter ego believability.

39:11.550 --> 39:14.417
You have so many doors
that would open up
in front of you.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.052
There's no question
about that for me.

39:16.088 --> 39:18.722
And then, wylie,
your country soulfulness

39:18.790 --> 39:20.390
just feels really authentic.

39:20.425 --> 39:22.058
Super charming.

39:22.094 --> 39:24.527
Really hard to send
anybody home right now.

39:27.299 --> 39:29.766
But we're going to
send wylie home.

41:44.636 --> 41:48.238
Aka, wylie, judges.

41:48.273 --> 41:50.607
It was a lot of fun
to watch you up here
on this stage.

41:50.642 --> 41:53.610
I had a lot of fun.

41:53.645 --> 41:56.846
Will your alter ego
live on after the show?

41:56.882 --> 41:58.281
Oh, yeah, it doesn't stop here.
I keep going. I keep going.

41:58.316 --> 41:59.449
Okay, that's
what I want to hear.

41:59.484 --> 42:01.784
Wylie chases it.
He chases it.

42:01.786 --> 42:02.886
Rocsi: Nick?

42:02.954 --> 42:04.821
Why do you think
you did need an alter ego?

42:04.823 --> 42:06.623
Where I come from,
you know, the south,

42:06.625 --> 42:08.758
a brother singing country music,
you don't get that all the time.

42:08.793 --> 42:10.460
- You don't get that
all the time.
- That's why we love it.

42:10.495 --> 42:14.264
Yeah, so having wylie,
you know, nobody can
see my skin color.

42:14.299 --> 42:16.499
You know, they didn't know.

42:16.535 --> 42:18.668
So that was my chance
to show you can sing
whatever you want to,

42:18.703 --> 42:21.638
and, you know, not be judged
at the same time, you know?

42:24.676 --> 42:26.276
Now I'm gonna learn
about country music...

42:26.311 --> 42:29.679
- Hey, I appreciate that.
- ...And, um, yeah.

42:29.714 --> 42:32.682
- I appreciate that, yeah.
- Yeah, that was awesome.

42:34.185 --> 42:36.586
What would you like to say
to your alter ego, wylie?

42:36.588 --> 42:37.820
Thank you.

42:37.856 --> 42:40.189
Thank you for the opportunity
to show the world

42:40.225 --> 42:42.625
and deliver this message
that I'm trying to deliver,

42:42.627 --> 42:43.993
which is you can do
whatever you want to,

42:44.029 --> 42:44.994
no matter where you come from.

42:45.030 --> 42:46.029
Rocsi: That's right.

42:48.300 --> 42:52.268
Thank you. So much.

42:52.304 --> 42:54.704
- Thank you so much, milton.
- Thank you.

42:54.773 --> 42:58.408
Guys, that's the end
of our auditions.

42:58.443 --> 43:00.810
Next week, we start
our head-to-head round,

43:00.879 --> 43:04.514
where our top 16
pair up to battle it out

43:04.549 --> 43:07.383
to secure a spot
in the semi-finals.

43:07.419 --> 43:09.352
We'll see you next week.
Good night.

43:11.456 --> 43:13.389
I haven't heard one
duck singer.

43:13.425 --> 43:15.758
- Every one was like songbirds.
- It's the first round.

43:15.794 --> 43:17.727
Can you imagine
what the head-to-head round
is gonna be like?

43:17.796 --> 43:20.496
- I think it's
gonna be nuts.
- Aah!

43:20.599 --> 43:22.398
Rocsi:
<i> The auditions are over.</i>

43:22.467 --> 43:24.667
<i> Now alter egos</i>
<i> will battle it out</i>

43:24.702 --> 43:26.903
<i> head-to-head style.</i>

43:26.938 --> 43:31.908

- Yeah!

43:33.478 --> 43:35.545
- ■■ <i>winner moves on... </i>
- You just have it.

43:35.580 --> 43:38.147
- You have star power.
- <i> ...And loser goes home.</i>

43:38.183 --> 43:40.750
This is where the competition
ends for you.

43:40.752 --> 43:43.219
<i> And more identities</i>
<i> will be revealed.</i>

43:45.590 --> 43:48.191
I can't understand why
you're not a superstar already.
