00:13.913 --> 00:16.715
Why do we have to eat this
whole sandwich before we kiss?

00:17.683 --> 00:19.484
I saw it in a movie.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.055
I thought it'd be romantic,

00:23.089 --> 00:25.490
the moment our lips
touch in the middle.

00:25.525 --> 00:28.960
Yeah, all filled with meat
and lettuce and tomato.

00:28.995 --> 00:31.930
Oh, you're right.
That's nasty.

00:31.964 --> 00:34.599
I'm gonna leave the
romantic moments up to you.

00:36.102 --> 00:37.602
Harper!

00:40.039 --> 00:41.773
Why didn't you talk
me out of this idea?

00:41.808 --> 00:44.076
Sometimes when I try to
talk you out of something,

00:44.110 --> 00:46.211
You just dig your
heels in even more.

00:46.245 --> 00:48.146
You're right,
I do do that.

00:48.181 --> 00:50.148
You should stop trying
to talk me out of stuff.

00:52.085 --> 00:53.785
Alex, it's all right.

00:53.820 --> 00:56.421
How's this for a
romantic moment?

00:58.024 --> 00:59.825
Oh, my gosh. Mason!

00:59.859 --> 01:02.027
Oh, my gosh, Mason!

01:11.704 --> 01:13.638
It glows?

01:13.673 --> 01:15.440
Yes.

01:16.709 --> 01:20.612
Quite unusual, really.
It runs on batteries.

01:22.315 --> 01:23.415
I love it.

01:24.617 --> 01:26.251
They're kissing!

01:29.589 --> 01:33.225
Hi, Mason! I didn't know you
two were in the middle of a date.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.560
Yes, you did, mom.

01:35.595 --> 01:39.197
You're the one who gave me your
headboard to make this fancy screen.

01:39.232 --> 01:42.067
Well, listen, I'm sorry, but we
need the tables for the evening rush.

01:42.101 --> 01:45.437
Your father handed out fliers without
the word "imitation" in front of "ham".

01:45.471 --> 01:47.873
- It's evening?
- Yes.

01:47.907 --> 01:51.343
Although most people would have keyed
off the fact that we use fake meat here.

01:51.377 --> 01:53.678
Oh, boy, it's getting late.
I better get going.

01:53.713 --> 01:56.181
But, you just got here.

01:56.215 --> 01:58.049
I lost track of time.

01:59.185 --> 02:00.585
In your eyes.

02:03.756 --> 02:05.423
Oh, I see what
you're doing there.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.925
I like it anyway.

02:06.959 --> 02:08.693
Wait! Mason. Mom!

02:08.728 --> 02:12.564
Why don't you two continue
your date tomorrow?

02:12.598 --> 02:14.566
A family dinner.

02:14.600 --> 02:17.302
- What time do you eat?
- We like to eat early.

02:17.336 --> 02:18.904
It gives us time for
the food to settle

02:18.938 --> 02:20.605
before we fight over
what to watch on tv.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.374
Great.
Thank you. Goodbye!

02:22.408 --> 02:25.577
- Oh, wait, your backpack.
- I'll get it tomorrow.

02:29.815 --> 02:31.616
What are you doing?

02:34.554 --> 02:37.155
Well, he sure was in a hurry
to get out of here.

02:38.257 --> 02:39.658
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

02:39.692 --> 02:41.826
I hope the dinner invite didn't
make him feel uncomfortable.

02:41.861 --> 02:44.262
No, no, that's ok. I'm
glad he's coming to dinner.

02:44.297 --> 02:46.264
I mean, once he sees how
messed up all of you are,

02:46.299 --> 02:47.866
he'll realize what
a miracle I am.

03:56.469 --> 03:58.403
Are you sure
that wasn't Juliet?

03:58.437 --> 04:00.305
'Cause it looked
a lot like her.

04:00.339 --> 04:03.174
No, it didn't.
It was a giant squid.

04:03.209 --> 04:05.477
I'm not too good
at remembering faces.

04:06.946 --> 04:08.413
And if you're so sure
it wasn't her,

04:08.447 --> 04:10.181
then why'd you
hug it for so long?

04:10.216 --> 04:13.184
It wasn't a hug!
It was strangling me.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.819
I don't know who's
a bigger idiot.

04:14.854 --> 04:17.889
The guy who told you mummies hide
their minions in underwater sea caves,

04:17.923 --> 04:21.726
- or me for believing you! - Don't
leave me out of the idiot contest.

04:25.498 --> 04:27.699
I don't think I'll
ever get Juliet back.

04:29.201 --> 04:31.403
All I've got
left of her is...

04:32.305 --> 04:34.773
This dental floss.

04:34.807 --> 04:38.310
I can picture her flossing
her fangs right now.

04:38.344 --> 04:41.379
Snap!

04:41.414 --> 04:43.381
Snap!

04:46.786 --> 04:50.055
Look, Justin, you're
gonna find her.

04:50.089 --> 04:53.058
All right? Not 'cause you're a monster
hunter, 'cause you're my brother.

04:55.061 --> 04:57.228
What makes you think
I'm gonna find her?

04:57.263 --> 04:59.197
Because in the ten years
that I've known you

04:59.231 --> 05:01.232
I've never seen you
give up on anything.

05:05.371 --> 05:07.972
You sure do have your moments
of wisdom, don't you, Max?

05:10.810 --> 05:13.511
You've known me
longer than ten years.

05:13.546 --> 05:15.947
Yeah, I wasn't really paying
attention in the beginning, though.

05:15.981 --> 05:18.583
Alex told me you
were our butler.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.362
Seriously,
Alex bowled a 17.

05:30.396 --> 05:33.331
And one time, she didn't even
bowl in the right direction.

05:35.301 --> 05:36.634
I was trying to
knock down the people

05:36.669 --> 05:38.870
in the snack bar line.
It was too long.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.074
How about another piece
of chicken, Mason?

05:43.109 --> 05:45.176
Oh, thank you. I would
love another piece.

05:45.211 --> 05:47.879
This chicken is much better
than the ones I catch.

05:50.049 --> 05:51.416
You catch chickens?

05:52.518 --> 05:54.786
Yes.

05:54.820 --> 05:56.688
At the grocery store.

05:56.722 --> 06:00.392
In England we say "catch"
like Americans say "shop".

06:00.426 --> 06:04.095
"Toodle-oo, I'm off
to go... Catching."

06:06.265 --> 06:08.466
British people
are so cute.

06:08.501 --> 06:10.935
I wish Americans
came from England.

06:15.474 --> 06:18.943
Don't lose hope.
I'll find you, my love.

06:20.446 --> 06:23.615
He's making a mashed potato
girlfriend out of my leftovers.

06:23.649 --> 06:25.116
Make him stop!

06:27.086 --> 06:29.587
Justin, she's beautiful.

06:30.756 --> 06:32.657
Hey! That's...

06:34.660 --> 06:36.194
There you go, Mr. Russo.

06:36.228 --> 06:38.430
Take a bite out of
her head for me. Yeah.

06:41.634 --> 06:44.369
Mason, the heart you
gave Alex is beautiful.

06:44.403 --> 06:47.639
Yeah. Hey, where'd you get it?
Theresa loves that kind of junk.

06:47.673 --> 06:49.174
Junk?

06:49.208 --> 06:51.042
I didn't say junk.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.712
I know why you
called it junk,

06:54.747 --> 06:58.249
because it's never quite as
beautiful as the ladies we buy it for.

06:58.284 --> 07:01.252
- Wouldn't you agree?
- Yes.

07:01.287 --> 07:03.421
It's never
quite as beautiful.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.156
Eat your chicken,
chicken.

07:07.259 --> 07:09.661
Ahem. Excuse me.
Mason?

07:10.729 --> 07:12.464
Did you say "ladies"?

07:12.498 --> 07:16.367
Who are all these ladies
you're buying jewelry for?

07:16.402 --> 07:20.772
I was just making conversation
to cover your father's faux pas.

07:23.042 --> 07:24.309
Harper?

07:24.343 --> 07:27.278
"Faux pas", French for
"foot in the mouth".

07:29.148 --> 07:31.483
Oh, my! It's getting dark.
I'm afraid I'm late.

07:31.517 --> 07:34.052
Wait, wait!
Late for what?

07:34.086 --> 07:37.689
I just have to go. Thank you for the
splendid dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Russo.

07:38.824 --> 07:40.792
Bye, love!
I'll see you tomorrow.

07:46.632 --> 07:50.835
Okay. I know what
you're all thinking.

07:50.870 --> 07:54.706
That every time he's here he suddenly
leaves without a good explanation.

07:54.740 --> 07:58.142
And now he says he
buys a lot of jewelry.

07:59.144 --> 08:01.412
So this could only
mean one thing.

08:01.447 --> 08:03.815
He's got another girlfriend.

08:03.849 --> 08:05.149
Thanks a lot, Harper.

08:05.184 --> 08:07.752
I was just gonna say he was
an international jewel thief

08:07.786 --> 08:10.655
with the feds on his tail,
but yours is probably closer.

08:18.230 --> 08:19.764
Lost vampire.

08:19.798 --> 08:22.433
Blonde, cute fangs,

08:22.468 --> 08:24.903
likes nose kisses,

08:24.937 --> 08:29.240
answers to Juliet or
shnoogly-boo-boo mccuteykins.

08:32.778 --> 08:35.513
Justin, can't stand
to see you like this,

08:35.548 --> 08:39.017
so I went down to the wiz-mart and
hung around the bandage section.

08:39.051 --> 08:41.352
To listen to clues
from other mummies

08:41.386 --> 08:44.255
who come to buy new bandages.
Very clever, Max.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.292
Who's the kid?

08:48.661 --> 08:50.061
Well, no mummies
came by,

08:50.095 --> 08:52.730
but I did find something
that's just as useful.

08:52.765 --> 08:55.533
Go ahead, kid, tell him
what you told me.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.468
I've lost me mummy.

09:03.442 --> 09:05.977
All we gotta do
is find his mummy,

09:06.011 --> 09:08.880
which could lead
us to our mummy.

09:08.914 --> 09:12.417
He's an english wizard! It sounds
like "mummy" but he means "mommy".

09:12.451 --> 09:14.385
That doesn't
make any sense.

09:17.289 --> 09:19.023
Just step back.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.626
Come on, kid, why don't
we, take you on home

09:21.660 --> 09:23.494
and find your mommy?

09:23.529 --> 09:26.898
Okay? And please don't
press charges, by the way.

09:26.932 --> 09:29.701
I'll get you a lollipop.
You like lollipops?

09:40.179 --> 09:41.613
Thank you.

09:42.848 --> 09:45.350
We're so lucky that we
found each other, aren't we?

09:45.384 --> 09:48.753
Lucky? I prefer
to call it destiny.

09:53.292 --> 09:57.095
You know,
some guys, or girls,

09:57.129 --> 09:59.897
have to keep
dating around,

09:59.932 --> 10:03.701
sometimes even behind
the other person's back...

10:03.736 --> 10:06.638
Just because
they're too dumb

10:06.672 --> 10:10.308
to see that the
right girl, or guy,

10:10.342 --> 10:13.211
is sitting right
in front of them.

10:13.245 --> 10:15.480
Well, I feel very sorry
for those people.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.715
Do you?
That's interesting.

10:19.718 --> 10:22.820
This is a delicious shake.
What's your secret?

10:22.855 --> 10:24.689
Why don't you
tell me yours first?

10:25.658 --> 10:26.758
I beg your pardon?

10:26.792 --> 10:30.461
Nothing, nothing.
Nothing.

10:30.496 --> 10:33.631
You know, I was just thinking that maybe
we should go to the movies tonight.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.267
There's this new
coming-of-age horror film

10:36.301 --> 10:38.469
Entitled I know
what you did last night,

10:38.504 --> 10:40.972
and you're not fooling me
at all, you dirty cheater.

10:42.474 --> 10:44.676
That's a rather long
title for a movie.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.678
Well, it's a sequel.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.413
Sequel titles
are always longer.

10:48.447 --> 10:51.416
The first one was called what's
her name, dirty cheater?

10:53.952 --> 10:56.621
I'd love to, but I can't.
I gotta go!

10:56.655 --> 10:57.755
Wait!

10:59.291 --> 11:02.326
There you go leaving again. Why
are you always in such a hurry?

11:02.361 --> 11:03.394
I'm sorry.

11:05.097 --> 11:07.098
- Please don't be angry
with me. - I'm not.

11:07.132 --> 11:09.567
I just want to know why you're
always leaving so suddenly.

11:09.601 --> 11:14.172
- I mean, is there something that I
should know? - No! I just have to go.

11:22.448 --> 11:25.116
Aha! Not so fast,
you two-timing Brit!

11:25.150 --> 11:27.385
- Who is she?
- What? Let me go!

11:27.419 --> 11:29.387
Harper, what
are you doing?

11:29.421 --> 11:32.557
The plan was to follow
him, not to wrestle him.

11:32.591 --> 11:35.326
I know, but I ran a lot
in gym today, so I'm tired.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.228
I just wanted
to get to it.

11:38.764 --> 11:40.565
Alex, please, go away.

11:40.599 --> 11:43.568
I'm sorry, Mason,
but...

11:43.602 --> 11:45.403
Harper thinks that you're
seeing another girl.

11:45.437 --> 11:48.873
- Please tell her that she's wrong.
- Just go away, please!

11:51.376 --> 11:54.946
So this is a painful
question for you.

11:55.948 --> 11:57.582
Get out of here!

12:34.284 --> 12:38.721
Sorry. Sometimes I go full
wolf when I don't need to.

12:41.025 --> 12:44.160
I don't think he has
another girlfriend.

12:44.194 --> 12:46.496
Maybe another dog.

12:49.867 --> 12:51.167
There are people around!

12:51.969 --> 12:54.370
Sorry, I can't help it.

12:54.405 --> 12:57.640
Now, based on the fact
neither of you ran off,

12:57.675 --> 12:59.609
I'd say you also
have a secret.

12:59.643 --> 13:03.446
What are you, an elf?
A wizard? A genie?

13:03.480 --> 13:04.881
Or just desperate?

13:09.453 --> 13:11.721
- I'm a wizard.
- And I'm not.

13:11.755 --> 13:13.523
And right now
I'm kind of glad.

13:14.925 --> 13:17.427
I knew there was
something about you.

13:17.461 --> 13:19.796
I apologize for rushing
off all the time,

13:19.830 --> 13:22.165
but now you can see what
the moon does to me.

13:24.068 --> 13:25.968
Your necklace
is still glowing.

13:27.071 --> 13:28.805
So? Must be
the batteries.

13:28.839 --> 13:31.507
No, I lied. It's not
battery operated.

13:31.542 --> 13:34.043
It's a magic necklace.

13:34.078 --> 13:39.615
It only glows when you're in love
with the person who put it on you.

13:39.650 --> 13:42.852
Oh, well, then...
I guess it works.

13:44.388 --> 13:47.490
And very convenient, too, because
now I don't have to tell you,

13:47.524 --> 13:50.326
which is something
I'm not really good at.

13:51.862 --> 13:55.264
Usually when girls find out
I'm a werewolf, they run off,

13:55.299 --> 13:57.934
which can only be
taken as a breakup.

14:00.037 --> 14:02.438
Well, does this look
like I'm running off?

14:05.542 --> 14:09.846
It's so freaky and
romantic at the same time.

14:20.791 --> 14:23.693
So, the first time I
turned, I was in London

14:23.727 --> 14:27.063
stuck behind a lorry at Piccadilly
Circus as the moon rose...

14:30.601 --> 14:33.069
What? "Piccadilly!"
It's a funny word.

14:33.103 --> 14:34.937
Listen to it. Piccadilly!

14:37.174 --> 14:39.342
Sorry, Mason.
Continue.

14:39.376 --> 14:42.211
What can I do but
dash into a building,

14:42.246 --> 14:45.014
where I found myself in the
middle of a dog competition.

14:45.048 --> 14:47.617
I jumped through hoops,
walked in circles,

14:47.651 --> 14:49.986
and accidentally
won best in show.

14:51.622 --> 14:54.857
You'd be best in any show.

14:54.892 --> 14:58.294
Well, Mason, you seem like
a fine young man-wolf

14:58.328 --> 14:59.762
who respects and
cares for Alex.

14:59.797 --> 15:03.566
And if you don't, I'll hunt
you down like a dog and...

15:03.600 --> 15:05.301
Well, you get the picture.

15:06.570 --> 15:08.805
I won't
forget that, sir.

15:08.839 --> 15:10.606
Does he like me?

15:14.278 --> 15:16.579
I'm just so happy
that Alex is happy.

15:16.613 --> 15:19.182
In fact, I'm gonna make you
guys matching dog hair vests.

15:19.216 --> 15:21.784
I've got this cousin in Albany
who's a dog groomer.

15:21.819 --> 15:24.253
He can send me
what I need, so...

15:27.191 --> 15:30.660
Hey! Hey, guys, check it out.
Mason's a werewolf.

15:30.694 --> 15:32.795
Oh, my gosh,
that's awesome!

15:32.830 --> 15:34.397
Now I'm not gonna
be the only one

15:34.431 --> 15:37.099
who likes to eat out
of a bowl on the floor.

15:37.134 --> 15:40.236
Okay, Justin, take
your best shot.

15:40.270 --> 15:41.804
You can pay me back
for all the times

15:41.839 --> 15:44.173
I've bagged on all your
wizard world girlfriends.

15:44.208 --> 15:49.312
Remember? That one time I asked if I could
ride your centaur girlfriend to school?

15:51.148 --> 15:54.250
Alex, I'm happy that you found
happiness in a relationship,

15:54.284 --> 15:57.019
no matter what
species he is.

15:57.054 --> 15:59.255
What's important is that
you're with someone.

15:59.289 --> 16:03.159
Max and I have looked everywhere
for Juliet and I can't find her.

16:05.162 --> 16:06.963
I've lost her forever
to the mummy.

16:09.566 --> 16:11.601
I think it's time
for me to give up.

16:12.236 --> 16:13.769
Wait! Justin.

16:13.804 --> 16:17.506
I want you to be happy
like I am with Mason.

16:17.541 --> 16:19.342
There's gotta be
something that we can do.

16:19.376 --> 16:23.446
You know, as a werewolf I have
keen dog-sniffing abilities.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.314
If I can have a
sample of her scent,

16:25.349 --> 16:27.316
I might be able to
track the target.

16:27.351 --> 16:30.519
No, Mason. We need to
find Justin's girlfriend,

16:30.554 --> 16:32.955
not a girl named target.

16:32.990 --> 16:35.825
I have some of her
dental floss, right here!

16:35.859 --> 16:37.560
- Check that out.
- Let me have a sniff.

16:37.594 --> 16:38.995
Get a good whiff,
get a good sniff.

16:39.029 --> 16:41.998
Get a good scent and
sniff it up, you sniffy...

16:42.032 --> 16:43.699
- Okay, I've got it!
- Sorry.

16:43.734 --> 16:45.968
Now go get my shnoogly-boo-boo
mccuteykins.

16:49.106 --> 16:52.575
Alex, thank you for not
letting me give up on Juliet.

16:53.610 --> 16:55.211
Feels good to
have hope again.

16:55.245 --> 16:57.546
You know, ever
since I met Mason,

16:57.581 --> 17:00.216
stuff like hope doesn't
actually annoy me anymore.

17:04.087 --> 17:06.856
By that how I think he's
got the scent. Let's go!

17:20.904 --> 17:23.439
It's not fair.

17:23.473 --> 17:26.809
How come he gets to pee on every tree
we pass and you slap me when I did it?

17:29.012 --> 17:30.813
That's better.

17:36.820 --> 17:39.722
Hey, I've been meaning
to ask you something.

17:39.756 --> 17:42.058
I thought when a werewolf
kisses a non-werewolf

17:42.092 --> 17:43.492
They turn into a werewolf.

17:43.527 --> 17:46.162
That's only with mutts.
I'm a purebred.

17:46.196 --> 17:48.898
Did you hear
that, Justin?

17:48.932 --> 17:50.766
My boyfriend's
a purebred.

18:03.146 --> 18:04.747
Juliet!

18:04.781 --> 18:06.682
Juliet!

18:08.051 --> 18:09.852
Are you sure we're
in the right place?

18:09.886 --> 18:12.488
Hard to confuse vampire
breath with another scent.

18:21.264 --> 18:23.532
The young fool
has finally come.

18:23.567 --> 18:25.968
The mummy!

18:26.003 --> 18:27.937
Whatever you guys do,
do not look into his eyes

18:27.971 --> 18:30.172
or else he'll shoot these red
beams and turn you into his minion.

18:30.207 --> 18:32.742
Thank you for that,
Mr. Over-explainer.

18:32.776 --> 18:35.878
Only an idiot would look
into the mummy's eyes.

18:35.912 --> 18:38.247
Hey, mummy, I think your
kid's looking for you.

18:40.851 --> 18:42.551
We've come for Juliet!

18:42.586 --> 18:45.921
I know. Your undying
love for Juliet

18:45.956 --> 18:48.290
made me expect
your arrival.

18:51.495 --> 18:53.162
Really?

18:54.865 --> 18:58.467
Actually, no. It was
Juliet's constant yammering.

18:58.502 --> 19:00.536
"My boyfriend's
gonna come for me!"

19:00.570 --> 19:03.572
"My boyfriend's
coming for me."

19:03.607 --> 19:05.908
Dude, that's actually a
really good impression.

19:07.411 --> 19:10.046
Release Juliet so she
can be with Justin,

19:10.080 --> 19:13.849
and we can all get back to doing
the boyfriend/ girlfriend thing.

19:13.884 --> 19:16.519
Juliet?

19:16.553 --> 19:20.322
Someone's here
to see you!

19:22.826 --> 19:27.129
Juliet! What did you do to my
beautiful sweet vampire girlfriend?

19:27.664 --> 19:29.899
It's a way to
keep her frozen

19:29.933 --> 19:32.868
until I need her
to do stuff for me.

19:34.871 --> 19:37.673
Oh, man! These are
my church shoes.

19:41.678 --> 19:43.279
Perfect.

19:43.947 --> 19:46.148
Hey, give me that!

19:46.183 --> 19:47.950
That's not a shoe scraper.

19:47.984 --> 19:50.152
This scarab
beetle is the key

19:50.187 --> 19:52.588
to reanimating the girl
in the hieroglyph.

19:54.958 --> 19:58.494
I talk too much.
Forget what I just said!

19:59.996 --> 20:01.797
I need to clean my
shoes with something.

20:01.832 --> 20:04.967
Oh, how about this?
This'll work.

20:05.635 --> 20:07.002
Hey! Cut it out!

20:07.037 --> 20:09.004
- Hand me the bandage!
- Good thinking, Max!

20:09.039 --> 20:11.941
No! That's not fair!

20:14.778 --> 20:16.312
Oh, this is not good.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.920
How does this work?

20:24.955 --> 20:26.388
Here, try this.

20:47.110 --> 20:48.777
- Justin.
- Juliet!

20:48.812 --> 20:51.013
You found me!

20:52.149 --> 20:53.482
I promised you I would.

20:58.755 --> 21:00.356
Mason, we just
had a victory.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.491
Pick me up and spin me around
like Justin did with her.

21:08.965 --> 21:12.501
You're looking at me and I'm not
turning into a minion. Or am I?

21:12.536 --> 21:14.703
No, I don't know
what a minion is.

21:17.340 --> 21:19.875
Mason. Thanks.

21:20.944 --> 21:22.745
I owe you one.

21:22.779 --> 21:24.013
Mason?

21:24.047 --> 21:26.815
Hello, Juliet.
It's been a long time.

21:26.850 --> 21:29.285
Well, yeah. 300 years.

21:29.319 --> 21:31.554
You haven't changed.

21:31.588 --> 21:33.989
Actually, I change
all the time, remember?

21:34.024 --> 21:36.625
Oh, my gosh, yeah. Ready?
Fetch! Fetch, boy.

21:36.660 --> 21:39.295
Fetch! Go on!
Yeah, go get the ball.

21:39.329 --> 21:41.830
Go, go, go!
Good job!

21:46.770 --> 21:48.437
What's going on?

21:49.972 --> 21:53.142
Do... Do you guys
know each other?

21:53.176 --> 21:55.644
Yeah.
We used to go out.

21:55.679 --> 21:57.713
Juliet was
my girlfriend.

22:02.652 --> 22:03.619
Wait a minute.

22:03.653 --> 22:06.422
So your girlfriend
and my boyfriend

22:06.456 --> 22:09.258
- used to be boyfriend and...
- Girlfriend.

22:15.265 --> 22:18.434
That would explain why she's
scratching him behind the ear.

22:20.470 --> 22:21.904
Oh, Mason!

22:21.938 --> 22:24.506
Hey, guys, check it out!

22:24.541 --> 22:27.443
You are now under my power.

22:27.477 --> 22:30.613
Go make me some waffles!

22:35.452 --> 22:36.785
It's a bad time.

22:48.396 --> 22:50.965
Oh, my gosh!

22:50.999 --> 22:55.336
I let you help me find my girlfriend,
who used to be your girlfriend?

22:55.370 --> 22:59.006
That thank you I said earlier? I
cancel that. Thank you very much.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.242
Wait. I cancel that, too.

23:02.811 --> 23:05.946
Mason, you haven't stopped
staring at Juliet since we found her.

23:05.981 --> 23:09.416
Juliet, I didn't know
we were looking for you.

23:09.451 --> 23:11.652
I never stopped
loving you!

23:11.686 --> 23:14.088
Oh, my gosh!

23:14.122 --> 23:16.991
- What are you doing?
- I don't know!

23:17.025 --> 23:19.326
Can't you see how
I feel about you?

23:19.361 --> 23:22.162
Alex, I'm sorry. Something
just came over me.

23:23.498 --> 23:25.499
I never want
to see you again.

23:29.771 --> 23:32.840
Dude, I don't know what you just
did, but she seems pretty hurt.

23:32.874 --> 23:35.776
I'm gonna let it slide,
so you and I are still good.

23:35.810 --> 23:37.378
No!

23:37.412 --> 23:39.713
Justin, please,
let me explain this.

23:39.748 --> 23:42.416
There's nothing to explain.
You broke Alex's heart.

23:44.986 --> 23:46.453
He's not cool
with any of us.

23:46.488 --> 23:48.455
I figured. I tried,

23:48.490 --> 23:51.158
but it was pretty hard to
totally misread the situation.

23:52.927 --> 23:54.662
Look, Juliet,

23:54.696 --> 23:56.997
I haven't known
you for 300 years,

23:57.032 --> 23:59.133
but I knew that I loved
you in an instant.

23:59.167 --> 24:02.236
We have something special,
and if you can't feel it, then...

24:03.805 --> 24:05.873
I'll never be able
to convince you.

24:08.209 --> 24:11.111
No. No, Justin,
it's you!

24:11.146 --> 24:13.881
You're the one
I'm in love with.

24:13.915 --> 24:15.949
Thank you!

24:15.984 --> 24:18.152
Thank you. I thought you'd
picked the hairier guy.

24:19.988 --> 24:21.822
I'm sorry, Mason.

24:21.856 --> 24:24.425
I loved you once, but
that was a long time ago.

24:24.459 --> 24:28.495
Like, before the United States
of America, a long time ago.

24:29.564 --> 24:31.231
Looks like my true
love is Justin.

24:32.266 --> 24:35.169
You even know how to
let a guy down sweetly.

24:35.403 --> 24:37.538
But please don't
ever do that to me.

24:37.572 --> 24:41.041
Oh, I have missed you and
your cute little insecurities.

24:41.076 --> 24:42.576
I'm so insecure!

24:52.587 --> 24:56.056
Listen, Mason, I've always wanted
to hang out with a werewolf,

24:56.091 --> 24:59.059
but I think my brother and sister
are gonna flash me out of here.

24:59.094 --> 25:01.328
So let's make a plan
to meet up at...

25:10.538 --> 25:12.406
Alex, honey?

25:13.141 --> 25:14.308
Open the door.

25:16.478 --> 25:17.945
Open the door.

25:25.620 --> 25:29.156
I said open the door,
not flash me in.

25:29.190 --> 25:30.958
I hate that.

25:32.627 --> 25:34.895
Oh, my sweetie!

25:34.929 --> 25:39.066
Oh, I know how much it hurts
when your heart gets broken.

25:39.100 --> 25:41.335
But time will heal it.

25:41.369 --> 25:42.903
And on the bright side,

25:42.937 --> 25:45.839
we're all really happy
to see you have feelings.

25:49.711 --> 25:52.446
Mason told Juliet
that he loved her.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.982
Right in front of me.

25:59.788 --> 26:03.991
Listen, you're gonna
fall in love so many times

26:04.025 --> 26:06.193
before you find the one
you'll be with forever.

26:06.227 --> 26:09.997
So think of it this way. You're
just one broken heart closer

26:10.031 --> 26:11.799
to happily ever after.

26:12.867 --> 26:15.536
Mom, that's just
fairy tale talk.

26:15.570 --> 26:17.538
I know.

26:17.572 --> 26:20.140
But my parenting guide doesn't
have a chapter on what to do

26:20.175 --> 26:22.409
when your wizard daughter's
werewolf boyfriend has been in love

26:28.650 --> 26:30.717
sometimes hugs work.

26:36.791 --> 26:38.659
And sometimes they don't.

26:40.395 --> 26:41.728
Come on, Mija.

26:46.734 --> 26:49.470
Harper, Jerry,
I brought Alex out here

26:49.504 --> 26:51.672
because I thought you guys might,
you know, have some advice

26:51.706 --> 26:54.174
- to help cheer her up.
- Just do what I do.

26:54.209 --> 26:55.776
Just push your feelings
down and hide them

26:55.810 --> 26:57.845
until they come out
to complete strangers.

26:57.879 --> 26:59.646
Hey, you!

27:03.284 --> 27:04.985
I'm gonna go back
into the lair.

27:05.019 --> 27:06.386
No, no, no, no!
Honey, wait.

27:06.421 --> 27:10.224
I know how to cheer you up.
See that guy out there?

27:10.258 --> 27:11.825
He ordered cola,

27:11.860 --> 27:15.028
but I am gonna
serve him prune juice.

27:16.798 --> 27:18.365
Come on!

27:24.506 --> 27:25.873
One cola.

27:33.248 --> 27:35.215
Was that great or what?!

27:35.250 --> 27:38.051
Oh, and now I'm
losing a customer.

27:38.086 --> 27:40.854
You love it when I lose
customers. There he goes!

27:41.923 --> 27:43.724
Oh, that poor man!

27:43.758 --> 27:46.393
What did he ever
do to you, dad?

27:49.631 --> 27:52.666
Your heart must
really be broken.

27:52.700 --> 27:53.767
Honey.

27:56.371 --> 27:57.504
Mason!

27:57.539 --> 28:00.240
Man, I knew you'd come
back to hang out with me.

28:00.275 --> 28:03.043
You're loyal.
You're just like a dog,

28:03.077 --> 28:04.545
like a were-dog.

28:06.180 --> 28:07.814
Yeah, I came
to talk to Alex.

28:08.850 --> 28:11.718
Talk to Alex?
That's crazy.

28:11.753 --> 28:14.254
It's like a fox,
like a were-fox.

28:15.957 --> 28:17.591
- Where's Alex?
- Re-Alex.

28:21.729 --> 28:22.696
Alex.

28:23.831 --> 28:25.165
Oh, my goodness!

28:25.199 --> 28:27.568
Mason, I don't think
Alex wants to see you.

28:27.602 --> 28:30.837
And not to gloat, but
I know Juliet doesn't.

28:30.872 --> 28:33.507
I came to fix things.

28:33.541 --> 28:35.842
Make him write down what
he wants to say to her.

28:35.877 --> 28:38.679
That accent gives him a
totally unfair advantage.

28:41.950 --> 28:44.718
Alex, I didn't mean
what I said earlier.

28:44.752 --> 28:47.588
I was in shock from seeing
Juliet, but I want to be with you.

28:48.923 --> 28:51.425
- Really?
- Yes, I do.

28:56.598 --> 28:58.131
Look, Mason...

28:59.534 --> 29:02.002
I've been in
shock before, too.

29:02.036 --> 29:05.072
Like when I accidentally
made my brother disappear.

29:05.106 --> 29:09.409
Or I accidentally made my
parents not know who I was.

29:10.745 --> 29:13.347
Or I accidentally got
trapped in a horror film.

29:13.381 --> 29:16.783
- Or I accidentally... - Honey,
we know. You've messed up a lot.

29:19.887 --> 29:21.221
Yes.

29:22.557 --> 29:24.458
And still, I've
never accidentally

29:24.492 --> 29:28.762
told someone I loved
them when I didn't.

29:28.796 --> 29:30.664
Alex, I know
it's hard to believe,

29:30.698 --> 29:32.966
- but if you let me explain...
- I think you've said enough.

29:34.402 --> 29:36.136
It's time for you
to go, Mason.

29:37.305 --> 29:38.639
Yes, sir.

29:39.574 --> 29:41.575
I'll be on my way, then.

29:41.609 --> 29:45.045
And I'll regret my mistake
for the rest of my life.

29:51.252 --> 29:54.187
Oh, that accent makes it
really hard to hold a grudge!

29:55.189 --> 29:56.923
What is wrong
with you people?

29:56.958 --> 29:59.459
That was our one chance to finally
have a werewolf in the family

29:59.494 --> 30:01.061
and you're all blowing it.

30:01.095 --> 30:04.197
Now I'm never gonna have
werewolf thanksgiving,

30:04.232 --> 30:07.167
and I'll never know what it's
like to have fur stuffing.

30:11.472 --> 30:13.940
It took everything I had
not to take him back.

30:14.975 --> 30:16.243
I'm just gonna go.

30:21.716 --> 30:23.350
She's hurting.

30:24.384 --> 30:28.321
Just like I was when Gary
Hollingshead came crawling back.

30:29.457 --> 30:31.958
Lucky for me my first
grade reading group

30:31.993 --> 30:34.761
made sure someone was
always by my side at recess.

30:36.164 --> 30:39.166
Exactly! That's why we should
all take turns on Alex watch

30:39.200 --> 30:41.034
to keep her from
running back to Mason.

30:41.669 --> 30:43.136
That's a good idea.

30:47.375 --> 30:49.009
Might as well
make it official.

30:49.043 --> 30:52.179
I'll do the schedule. Juliet
and I will take the first shift.

30:52.213 --> 30:55.716
I'm sorry, but doubling up on
shifts is against the rules.

30:55.750 --> 30:57.451
I thought it would
be a good idea,

30:57.485 --> 30:59.920
since I haven't seen my
girlfriend in, like, forever.

30:59.954 --> 31:02.689
In case you forgot, she
was enslaved by a mummy!

31:02.724 --> 31:04.124
Yeah, well,
you thought wrong.

31:09.397 --> 31:11.598
Excuse me, do you
sell any dog hair?

31:11.632 --> 31:15.035
I'm gonna stick it all over me
and make myself a werewolf.

31:18.272 --> 31:19.873
I get it, you're gonna
go check in the back.

31:19.907 --> 31:21.575
All right, thanks, buddy.

31:24.212 --> 31:26.346
Yo, Mason, what's up?
Where you going?

31:26.380 --> 31:30.417
Listen, Max, it's probably not a
good idea that we hang out anymore.

31:30.451 --> 31:31.918
I'm missing
your sister a lot,

31:31.953 --> 31:34.855
and when I see you
I think of her.

31:34.889 --> 31:38.959
Wait, hold on a minute. I'm deciding
if I should be offended or not.

31:40.428 --> 31:42.229
No, I'm good.

31:43.765 --> 31:45.832
Mason, you can't just
give up like that, man.

31:45.867 --> 31:48.101
I mean, you and Alex
should be together.

31:48.136 --> 31:50.737
And I think you should make it
happen by werewolf thanksgiving.

31:51.472 --> 31:53.173
Werewolf thanksgiving?

31:53.707 --> 31:57.110
Yeah, I kinda told all my wizard
friends I was going to your house.

31:57.145 --> 31:59.179
Because you guys
eat pilgrims.

32:00.548 --> 32:02.582
I don't know if Alex
will ever understand this,

32:02.617 --> 32:04.317
but werewolves
are very loyal.

32:04.352 --> 32:06.319
The problem is
we're also impulsive,

32:06.354 --> 32:10.056
and that's why seeing Juliet made
me say things I didn't even mean.

32:10.091 --> 32:13.760
And now that you mention
it, I'm craving pilgrims!

32:13.795 --> 32:16.196
Well, I think you should
explain that to Alex.

32:16.230 --> 32:18.732
Not the pilgrim part, 'cause that's
gonna feel like history to her,

32:18.766 --> 32:20.300
she's gonna tune out.

32:20.334 --> 32:23.403
But, like, the impulsive thing,
that's definitely worth mentioning.

32:23.437 --> 32:26.907
Yeah. I haven't been able
to talk to her alone.

32:26.941 --> 32:28.608
She's upstairs.

32:28.643 --> 32:31.611
She's either crashed out on the
couch or she's doing homework.

32:34.182 --> 32:36.483
Oh, man, I'm sorry! No, she's
crashed out on the couch.

32:40.921 --> 32:42.422
The door's locked.

32:42.856 --> 32:44.157
Oh, wait, I have a key!

32:44.192 --> 32:46.226
It's inside, I'll go get it.

32:50.665 --> 32:52.599
Oh, wait, I know,
I have a key. It's inside.

32:52.633 --> 32:54.201
I'll go get it.

32:58.005 --> 33:02.275
<i>And now we return to I'm
in love with a teen werewolf.</i>

33:03.678 --> 33:05.612
You're gonna watch
a werewolf movie?

33:05.646 --> 33:07.614
Not a good idea.

33:07.648 --> 33:10.217
Oh, hey, look, this
is the funny part

33:10.251 --> 33:12.652
when all the angry villagers
surround the werewolf

33:12.687 --> 33:14.788
and then they destroy him!

33:15.923 --> 33:17.958
I wonder where you can
get torches like that.

33:20.928 --> 33:23.129
We need a different
distraction.

33:24.999 --> 33:27.400
Alex, look who I brought,

33:27.435 --> 33:29.069
your werewolf boyfriend.

33:30.471 --> 33:31.738
My gosh, Mason!

33:31.772 --> 33:34.074
Max! How could
you do this?

33:34.108 --> 33:35.675
Well, let me tell you,

33:35.710 --> 33:37.944
it wasn't easy finding the
key to the door I never use

33:37.979 --> 33:40.780
'cause it was inside when
we needed it, that's how.

33:46.020 --> 33:48.655
Alex, I'm over Juliet,
you've got to believe me.

33:48.689 --> 33:50.390
Well, I don't.

33:50.424 --> 33:53.393
Just because she didn't want you,
Mason, I'm your second choice.

33:53.427 --> 33:55.795
Things are going
well on my shift.

33:58.699 --> 34:00.901
Listen to me, Alex,
I can prove it.

34:00.935 --> 34:02.836
All we have to do is
go back to Transylvania

34:02.870 --> 34:04.838
and find the true
love necklace.

34:04.872 --> 34:06.506
If you put it on me
and it glows,

34:06.540 --> 34:08.875
then you'll know how
I truly feel about you.

34:10.110 --> 34:11.911
No, I'm never
going back there.

34:11.946 --> 34:14.714
- You can go get it.
- No! You have to go with me,

34:14.748 --> 34:17.183
because that's
where it all went bad,

34:17.217 --> 34:19.953
and that's where I'm
gonna make it all go good.

34:24.458 --> 34:25.792
Okay.

34:26.928 --> 34:29.262
I have to know the truth.
Let's go.

34:29.297 --> 34:32.098
No, you can't go!
Alex watch was my idea.

34:32.132 --> 34:34.833
And now you need another
idea on how to cover for me.

34:34.869 --> 34:36.770
Thank you.

34:37.538 --> 34:38.605
You're a good friend.

34:43.344 --> 34:45.378
You were on
Alex watch?

34:45.413 --> 34:47.813
Way to watch her leave.

34:49.516 --> 34:50.984
Oh, no, this isn't good!

34:51.018 --> 34:53.987
What am I gonna do when
Mr. Russo shows up for his shift?

34:54.420 --> 34:55.655
Hey, Harper!

34:57.391 --> 35:00.460
I'm ready for my Alex
watch. Where is she?

35:01.796 --> 35:03.763
See you in p.E.!

35:07.735 --> 35:10.303
No. Wait! Wait!

35:11.005 --> 35:12.839
Where's Alex?

35:14.536 --> 35:16.670
Okay, then, well,
where is she?

35:16.704 --> 35:19.640
I don't know. Harper's the
one that let her get away.

35:21.409 --> 35:24.511
- I know where Alex went.
- Where?

35:24.545 --> 35:27.214
All right, well, we all
understand this wasn't my shift,

35:27.248 --> 35:29.850
- So I can't get in
trouble, right? - Yes.

35:31.953 --> 35:33.921
She went with Mason
back to Pennsylvania.

35:33.955 --> 35:37.457
Pennsylvania.
The keystone state.

35:38.726 --> 35:40.594
Are you sure he didn't
say Transylvania?

35:40.628 --> 35:43.263
I don't know. Say "Pennsylvania"
with a British accent.

35:44.532 --> 35:46.166
Transylvania.

35:47.535 --> 35:49.469
That is it.

35:49.504 --> 35:52.339
Okay, come on! We'll pick
up Juliet along the way.

35:52.373 --> 35:55.275
Shouldn't she be picking us
up? She's the one with wings.

36:09.824 --> 36:12.092
The necklace has gotta
be here somewhere.

36:14.929 --> 36:17.965
Maybe if I throw this dirt clod
like I threw the necklace,

36:17.999 --> 36:19.633
we'll be able to see
where the necklace went.

36:24.672 --> 36:25.973
Why did you do that?

36:26.507 --> 36:28.775
Because I missed you with
the necklace the first time.

36:30.778 --> 36:32.546
Hey! There you are.

36:32.580 --> 36:34.281
How did you guys find us?

36:35.717 --> 36:38.118
Don't tell her
it was me.

36:38.152 --> 36:40.387
Mason! It's good
to see you, buddy.

36:40.421 --> 36:41.622
Yeah, you too.

36:42.991 --> 36:45.325
I wish you were cool with
me like your little brother.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.995
That's where you're right.
You and I are not cool.

36:48.429 --> 36:51.198
- Now back away from my
sister. - Justin, it's ok.

36:51.232 --> 36:53.967
He's gonna prove his feelings for
me with the true love necklace.

36:54.002 --> 36:56.136
As long as you guys are here,
can you help look for it?

36:56.170 --> 36:57.938
Yeah, I'll help
you find it.

36:57.972 --> 36:59.406
It's weird, I love
things that glow.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.808
I'm like a moth,
like a were-moth.

37:05.747 --> 37:08.749
Listen, ringo, you gotta stop
toying with my sister's feelings,

37:08.783 --> 37:10.283
because the last time
we were together,

37:10.318 --> 37:12.285
you were messing
with my girlfriend.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.554
Not that I'd want you
to do that again.

37:14.589 --> 37:17.624
I'd rather you mess with my
sister rather than my girlfriend...

37:19.827 --> 37:21.762
Let me take this again.
Listen, ringo...

37:21.796 --> 37:24.698
Okay, his point is you need
to leave all of us alone.

37:24.732 --> 37:27.567
Exactly! Come on, Alex,
you're coming with me.

37:27.902 --> 37:29.336
No, she's not
going anywhere!

37:29.370 --> 37:31.171
All right, now that's
my throwing arm.

37:31.205 --> 37:33.106
I'm not leaving
without my sister.

37:34.876 --> 37:37.711
I said she's not
going anywhere!

37:38.980 --> 37:42.215
Look! Look, Mason's
a werewolf. Awesome!

37:42.250 --> 37:45.318
Especially since I know I'm not in danger
'cause we're buddies, right, Mason?

37:45.353 --> 37:47.854
Mason?

37:47.889 --> 37:51.491
Mason, you didn't
answer my question.

37:51.526 --> 37:54.895
All right, you're busy.
That's cool.

37:56.798 --> 37:59.800
Look, I'll admit it, I'm
a little scared right now,

37:59.834 --> 38:01.535
But I'm not backing down.

38:01.569 --> 38:03.236
- Come on, Alex, we're
going home. - No!

38:03.271 --> 38:05.338
I have to find
the necklace.

38:07.809 --> 38:09.543
I'm not going anywhere.

38:19.620 --> 38:20.620
Justin!

38:55.523 --> 38:56.857
I found it!

38:58.860 --> 39:00.260
Alex, come on!

39:01.763 --> 39:03.063
Wait!

39:11.139 --> 39:13.140
Get away from her!

39:15.409 --> 39:16.910
I got him!

39:19.680 --> 39:20.881
Maybe not.

39:22.683 --> 39:25.085
- What are you doing? - I have
to get that necklace down.

39:25.119 --> 39:26.219
But...

39:28.923 --> 39:32.559
- My wand! - I'm sorry.
I couldn't think of a spell.

39:32.593 --> 39:34.594
Justin! Look out!

39:50.077 --> 39:51.878
My wings.

40:14.535 --> 40:17.337
Get off him!

40:21.008 --> 40:22.676
No!

40:24.745 --> 40:26.279
You bit me.

40:26.314 --> 40:27.814
How could you do this?

40:27.849 --> 40:29.616
I didn't have a choice.

40:29.650 --> 40:32.185
- You were attacking my boyfriend.
- What's going on?

40:32.220 --> 40:35.488
When a vampire bites a
werewolf, they turn into a wolf.

40:35.523 --> 40:38.625
- You mean a werewolf?
- No, a wolf, forever!

40:38.659 --> 40:41.061
Yeah, and when a werewolf
scratches a vampire...

40:41.095 --> 40:44.798
- What?
- I lose my vampire powers.

40:45.700 --> 40:48.168
Well, that's not so bad.

40:48.402 --> 40:51.304
Justin, I'm gonna
look my real age.

40:51.839 --> 40:53.673
I'm not so shallow that
I would let something

40:53.708 --> 40:55.876
like an age difference
come in between us.

40:57.578 --> 41:00.347
I'm 2193 years old.

41:03.584 --> 41:05.452
That's a lot of years.

41:11.626 --> 41:15.128
Alex! Hey, I got
the necklace down.

41:17.098 --> 41:19.432
But the mummy eyes
are still up there.

41:38.486 --> 41:40.053
You do love me.

41:41.222 --> 41:42.355
I do.

41:43.991 --> 41:47.427
But it's too late for us.

41:47.461 --> 41:49.996
You could never have a
normal life with me now.

41:50.031 --> 41:52.265
But I'm a wizard.

41:52.300 --> 41:54.834
Nothing about my life
has ever been normal.

41:54.869 --> 41:59.873
I have to go. When I turn into
a wolf, I can't control myself.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.681
It won't be safe for you.

42:20.161 --> 42:22.495
At least you know
I truly love you.

42:39.981 --> 42:42.282
Justin, we can't
be together.

42:42.316 --> 42:46.186
Yes, we can. I'll love you
no matter how old you are.

43:02.468 --> 43:04.637
You are old!

43:07.641 --> 43:08.942
But I don't care.

43:09.276 --> 43:11.011
I know you don't.

43:12.046 --> 43:14.014
But you have to
let me go, Justin.

43:14.982 --> 43:16.649
I'll never let you go.

43:18.886 --> 43:21.154
I'll keep you
right in here.

43:22.723 --> 43:24.257
Forever.

43:29.463 --> 43:30.797
Juliet.

43:34.001 --> 43:35.702
I'll never forget you.

44:02.897 --> 44:04.631
Are you all right?

44:07.501 --> 44:10.270
No. Are you?

44:12.840 --> 44:14.007
No.

44:18.846 --> 44:20.180
He loved me.

44:23.050 --> 44:25.085
And I found her...

44:26.187 --> 44:27.654
And I lost her again.

44:33.694 --> 44:35.728
- Max!
- What?

44:35.763 --> 44:36.996
What are you doing?

44:38.199 --> 44:40.600
I'm howling. What does
it look like I'm doing?

44:50.611 --> 44:53.746
I'll see you around, buddy.

44:59.486 --> 45:02.555
Promise me we'll

45:04.558 --> 45:06.659
We're not normal people.

45:53.407 --> 45:58.378
I will do whatever you want
and ask for nothing in return.

45:58.912 --> 46:00.513
They work!

46:02.200 --> 46:05.400
I want lasagne

46:08.300 --> 46:10.800
