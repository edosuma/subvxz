Oh, no! No, no, no,
you're wrong, Bigmouth.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.029
It's, uh,
it's those glasses, you..

11:40.049 --> 11:41.039
[stammering]

11:41.059 --> 11:44.100
Let's get out of here, Azrael!

11:44.120 --> 11:46.049
[Azrael meowing]

11:47.000 --> 11:50.049
Bigmouth like goodies.

11:50.070 --> 11:51.149
(Gargamel)
No! No, no, get away.

11:51.169 --> 11:54.120
Get away!
I'm not what you think!

11:54.139 --> 11:56.049
[Smurfs laughing]

11:57.179 --> 11:59.200
I hate laughing.

12:00.230 --> 12:03.149
(Jokey)
Hooray for the Smurfette!

12:03.169 --> 12:05.120
[all cheering]

12:06.169 --> 12:08.149
I made such a smurf of things..

12:08.169 --> 12:10.139
Yoo-hoo, Handy.

12:10.159 --> 12:12.230
Aren't you coming
to my party?

12:13.009 --> 12:15.179
- Handy, are you alright?
- Go on, Smurfette.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.200
Smurf me a good one right here.
I deserve it.

12:18.220 --> 12:21.200
- A real good one?
- Hard as you can.

12:21.220 --> 12:25.029
- Handy, are you sure?
- Absosmurfly.

12:25.049 --> 12:27.179
Okay. Here goes.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.080
Mwah!

12:29.100 --> 12:31.149
But, but I thought
you'd be mad at me

12:31.169 --> 12:34.110
because of all the trouble
those glasses caused.

12:34.129 --> 12:38.080
You didn't need those glasses
for me to like you, Handy.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.120
I-I didn't?

12:40.139 --> 12:44.200
No. I-I like you
just the way you are.

12:44.220 --> 12:47.100
Really? Oh, boy.

12:47.120 --> 12:51.080
Then I'm gonna smurf you
the smurfiest present ever!

12:54.080 --> 12:57.059
I hate being flattened.

13:00.049 --> 13:02.179
