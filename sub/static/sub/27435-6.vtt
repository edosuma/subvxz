is criminal,

and base my defense
on the facts.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.726

is that there is no motion

that he didn't give me a case,

right after Reddington was.

04:57.790 --> 04:58.950
He might know
his real identity.

04:59.030 --> 05:00.998
Yeah, and if could find him,
maybe he'd tell us,

he didn't have one.

They don't know that.

Gerald Todd Klepper
was a doctor in Newark

05:22.820 --> 05:24.549
who murdered 17 patients.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.552
They think,
but they don't know.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.724
By the time
the police realized
Klepper was responsible,

05:30.790 --> 05:32.223
he was gone.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.019
And in the 28 years Since,
no one's found him

05:34.100 --> 05:35.351
because,
according to Reddington,

05:35.430 --> 05:37.193
he had his appearance altered

05:37.270 --> 05:40.433
by everyone's
favorite plastic surgeon

Dr. Hans Koehler.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.868
I'm sorry. So, Reddington
wants us to track down

one of Dr. Koehler's
patients?

05:47.010 --> 05:49.069

with their names on it.

The Bureau has assigned a team
to track them down.

05:51.310 --> 05:53.778
He says Klepper
is a very Special case.

05:53.850 --> 05:55.408
And, no, he didn't say why.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.584
And we can't ask him
because he hoodwinked
his judge

05:57.650 --> 06:00.050
into sending him to Missouri
for a psych eval.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.951

"Angel of Death"?

06:02.020 --> 06:03.385
(KNOCKS AT DOOR)

06:03.460 --> 06:06.258
Let's start with what we don't
know, like his current ID,

06:06.330 --> 06:08.195
what he looks like,
and where he lives.

06:10.670 --> 06:13.389
You said you could be
of assistance.

06:13.470 --> 06:14.767
What we do know is that,

06:14.840 --> 06:16.364
according
to Koehler's medical file,

06:16.440 --> 06:19.102
prior to his operation,
Klepper was on dialysis.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.536
Our only lead is a 28-year-old
medical condition?

06:21.610 --> 06:23.441
That's the only lead
the police have.

06:23.510 --> 06:26.206
But the victims' families
hired a P.I. to follow up,

06:26.280 --> 06:27.975
and what he found,
we don't know.

06:28.050 --> 06:29.711
And you need
to talk to him.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.109
We know who Klepper was,

06:31.190 --> 06:33.215
maybe this guy
can tell us who he is.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.381
MAN: Cindy Kobata
was fighting leukemia.

06:37.460 --> 06:39.997
Jim Franklin had a wife
and two kids.

06:40.060 --> 06:42.767
Bethany Ray
had cystic fibrosis.

06:42.830 --> 06:45.822
She'd just turned 21
when Klepper killed her.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.629
How long've you
been working this case?

06:47.700 --> 06:50.260
The families
came to me in '94.

06:50.340 --> 06:51.659
I wish I could'a
been more help,

06:51.740 --> 06:54.470
but Klepper stayed
off the grid.

06:54.540 --> 06:58.249
no citizenship, no taxes,
no footprint, nothing.

06:58.310 --> 07:00.244
Is there anything you can
tell us about him now?

07:00.320 --> 07:02.811
I can tell you
the cops had it all wrong.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.118
They said he was all

07:04.190 --> 07:05.839
about putting people
out of their misery,

07:05.920 --> 07:09.412
but these people
were demanding
aggressive treatment.

07:09.490 --> 07:12.152
They weren't targeted because
they wanted to die,

07:12.230 --> 07:14.323
they were targeted
because they wanted to live.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.697
Now, why would he do that?

07:15.760 --> 07:17.489
Because by fighting
to stay alive,

07:17.570 --> 07:20.095
they used up resources
that he thought
were better used

07:20.170 --> 07:21.660
on healthier patients.

07:21.740 --> 07:23.605
You make him sound like
an actuary.

07:23.670 --> 07:24.932
Hmm.

07:25.010 --> 07:27.205
Most people think life
is priceless.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.338
Not Klepper.

07:28.410 --> 07:31.140
He did a cost-benefit analysis
on these people,

07:31.210 --> 07:33.519
figured that the cost
outweighed the benefits,

07:33.580 --> 07:35.810
and killed them
because of it.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.984
KLEPPER:
You killed someone.

07:38.050 --> 07:40.883
For that, most people would
believe you belong in prison.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.313
Their belief is based

07:42.390 --> 07:45.052
on a Judeo-Christian
tradition of justice.

07:45.130 --> 07:46.859
Mine is more algebraic.

07:46.930 --> 07:49.899
There's a constant
and a variable.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.460
The constant
is the work you do.

07:51.530 --> 07:53.066
It has value,

07:53.140 --> 07:55.199
and it will be compromised
with you behind bars.

07:55.270 --> 07:58.535
The variable
is what economists
call the VSL,

07:58.610 --> 08:01.329
the value
of statistical life.

08:01.410 --> 08:03.298
In this case,
the value of your life

08:03.380 --> 08:05.200
versus the value of the life
of the witness

08:05.280 --> 08:09.046
whose testimony
will put you behind bars.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.418
Okay, I can make it
worth their while
not to say anything.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.253
The authorities
have identified her.

08:13.320 --> 08:16.357
She was walking
home that night
and saw what she saw.

08:16.420 --> 08:18.422
_She's made
a preliminary statement.

08:18.490 --> 08:23.393
At this point, a bribe has
a low probability of success.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.028
I'm afraid my equation
is premised

08:25.100 --> 08:27.739
on a more permanent
solution.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.097
Killing her.

08:29.170 --> 08:31.764
If her VSL
is lower than yours.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.398
You can't put a price
on a life.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.199
Nearly every department
in our government has a VSL.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.770
The EPA'S
is $10 million.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.613
The FDA'S
is $7.9 million.

08:39.680 --> 08:40.749
The Department
of Transportation

08:40.820 --> 08:42.344
is $6.4 million.

08:42.420 --> 08:43.580
The annoying beep
that goes off

08:43.650 --> 08:44.719
when the people
in the front seat

08:44.790 --> 08:46.041
don't put their seatbelts on?

08:46.120 --> 08:47.553
Ever wonder why
there was no beep

08:47.620 --> 08:49.053
for the people
sitting in the back?

08:49.120 --> 08:52.556
It would cost
the auto industry
$325 million a year

08:52.630 --> 08:53.858
and save 44 lives.

08:53.930 --> 08:56.922
325 divided by 44
is 7.4,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.468
meaning that the value of each
life that would be saved

08:59.530 --> 09:01.293
is $7.4 million.

09:01.370 --> 09:04.931
But since DOT values each life
at only $6.4 million,

09:05.010 --> 09:06.807
no beeps in the back.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.074
Those are
statistical models

09:08.140 --> 09:10.074
to determine
the cost of a life,

09:10.150 --> 09:12.914

from societal norms?

If you're divorced

But whatever pathologies
you have,

21:29.350 --> 21:30.942
I think they can be
traced to the fact that,

21:31.020 --> 21:35.684
while most people see you
as a, uh, iconic bad guy,

21:35.760 --> 21:38.058

(DOOR CLOSES)

29:20.390 --> 29:22.153
LIZ: He says no.

29:22.220 --> 29:24.586
But I think
this should change his mind.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.794
Look familiar?

29:33.870 --> 29:35.337
It should.
It's a picture of you

29:35.400 --> 29:36.992
in Dr. Hans Koehler's
medical file,

29:37.070 --> 29:39.265
complete with a list
of every time he chiseled you

29:39.340 --> 29:40.534
or injected you,

29:40.610 --> 29:42.168
shaved you down
or puffed you up.

29:42.240 --> 29:43.673
I don't recognize
this person.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.674
Well, Koehler
did a remarkable job

29:45.750 --> 29:48.719
of changing
your appearance.

29:48.780 --> 29:52.318
But we both know that
he can't change your DNA.

29:52.390 --> 29:55.450
And that when we do take it,
it's gonna match up to his.

29:55.520 --> 29:56.953
Isn't it, Doctor?

30:01.130 --> 30:02.688
I like to make
calculations.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.864
Like deciding who should live
and who should die?

30:04.930 --> 30:06.693
That's one
calculation, yes.

30:06.770 --> 30:08.169
Have you made it often?

30:08.240 --> 30:09.730
Often enough.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.631
And it's a surprisingly
easy one.

30:11.710 --> 30:14.133
Others are considerably
more difficult.

30:14.210 --> 30:17.304
Like why the FBI sent
only one agent and one...

30:17.380 --> 30:19.871
I'm not sure what.
We know who you were

30:19.950 --> 30:22.646
before Dr. Koehler
changed your identity.

30:22.720 --> 30:26.884
What we want to know is
who Raymond Reddington was.

to Koehler's records,

30:28.760 --> 30:30.079
you and Reddington
were patients

at approximately
the same time.

30:31.960 --> 30:35.088
And you think, what, we bonded
in post-op? Compared scars?

30:35.160 --> 30:36.752
(CHUCKLES) The whole point
of going to Koehler

30:36.830 --> 30:38.092
was to become anonymous.

Reddington?

31:08.030 --> 31:09.429
Well, did you talk to him?

31:09.500 --> 31:11.889
Oh. Yeah.
He didn't know anything.

31:11.970 --> 31:14.029
For once we know
more than he does.

31:14.100 --> 31:17.228

31:31.690 --> 31:34.079
About Reddington...

31:34.160 --> 31:35.752
If you didn't see him,
who did?

31:35.820 --> 31:37.458
A nurse.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.125
She saw all the patients,
before and after.

31:40.190 --> 31:41.748
She could tell you
who Reddington was.

31:41.830 --> 31:43.252
What's her name?

31:43.330 --> 31:45.161
Your colleagues
are on their way.

31:45.230 --> 31:47.266
And for some reason,
you didn't tell them
you were already here.

31:47.330 --> 31:49.298
What is her name?
I don't randomly decide

31:49.370 --> 31:50.769
who's gonna live or die.

31:50.840 --> 31:53.058
I do it based on
whose life has more value.

31:53.140 --> 31:55.108
Take us, for example.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.307
I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life in prison.

31:57.380 --> 31:59.302
You could have a long
and productive career.

31:59.380 --> 32:02.838
By any reasonable standard,
your life has more value,

32:02.920 --> 32:04.285
which is why
you should get my gun.

32:04.350 --> 32:07.808
We need a name.
And I'll give it to you

32:07.890 --> 32:09.755
once I get you to understand
that you have to kill me.

32:09.820 --> 32:12.823
What are you talking about?
I don't know why you want to
know who Reddington was,

32:12.890 --> 32:15.791
but clearly you're willing to
risk a great deal to find out.

32:15.860 --> 32:19.023
Your career, all the good and
productive things you'll do

32:19.100 --> 32:21.034
that makes your life
more valuable than mine,

32:21.100 --> 32:22.636
but it only has that value

32:22.700 --> 32:24.361
if your colleagues
never find out you were here.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.702
And the only way
that's gonna happen

32:25.770 --> 32:27.863
is if I'm dead
when they arrive.

32:27.940 --> 32:31.171
Like I said,
it's a surprisingly
easy calculation.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.468
We're not gonna kill you.

32:33.550 --> 32:35.370
Of course not.

32:35.450 --> 32:37.668
You're gonna
kill yourself.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.388
That's what you do.
You stage killings

32:39.450 --> 32:40.849
and make them
look like accidents.

how you figure it?

Not exactly, no.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.884
I, uh,
found Klepper's burner

35:27.950 --> 35:30.453

That's the number_ forensics
pulled off it.

that you gave me.

35:35.900 --> 35:38.323
So, the way I
"figure it,"

35:38.400 --> 35:40.618
is that you gave us
a fake number

so that you could
get to Klepper first.

35:46.040 --> 35:48.508
See, first-thought theater
was that you were doing it

35:48.580 --> 35:50.502
for Reddington.
I mean, he's not around,

35:50.580 --> 35:53.208
so you're carrying
his water for him.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.770
But then I checked.

35:54.850 --> 35:56.841
Since he's been in Missouri,
he hasn't been allowed

35:56.920 --> 35:58.808
any calls in or out.

not his.

kill himself.

Because he convinced me

outweighed the cost.

What difference does it make?
We're so close.

38:46.881 --> 38:46.950
The difference that it makes
is that I'm worried

38:46.950 --> 38:48.815
that he's gonna do it to me.

He's not my friend.

39:30.300 --> 39:33.269
Well, whoever he is,
he was intent on killing me.

39:33.330 --> 39:36.834
I think he said
he was going to,
uh, "rip my tongue out."

39:37.740 --> 39:40.265
But your reaction
was everything.

39:40.340 --> 39:41.773
My reaction?

39:41.840 --> 39:44.035
You came to my defense.

39:44.110 --> 39:47.739
You saw that Mr. Rodrick
was intent on causmg me harm,

39:47.810 --> 39:49.448
and although
you don't know me,

39:49.520 --> 39:52.648
you made the very
conscious decision
to stop him,

39:52.720 --> 39:56.156
which, to my mind, is a...
is a wonderful demonstration

40:25.490 --> 40:27.981
while one with a criminal
history like Mr. Reddington

40:28.050 --> 40:29.915
would likely
have to be insane,

does understand
the charges leveled
against him

Wonderful.
Then we're clear to proceed.

41:01.390 --> 41:03.051
Mr. Sima?

41:03.120 --> 41:06.157
Your Honor, of the indictments
that are before the court,

41:06.230 --> 41:08.289
the prosecution
has elected to proceed

41:08.360 --> 41:10.021
with the charge of treason

41:10.100 --> 41:13.160
as our first case
against the defendant.
Very well.

41:13.230 --> 41:16.336
We'll move to jury selection
immediately.

Why? What's wrong?

42:03.250 --> 42:05.343
I spoke
with Atticus Rodrick.

42:05.420 --> 42:07.047
Was he any help?

42:07.120 --> 42:09.281
He gave me a name...

42:09.360 --> 42:11.851
General Shiro.

42:11.930 --> 42:13.818
I need you to find out
everything you can about him.

General Shiro?
Yes.

He's the next name
on the Blacklist.
