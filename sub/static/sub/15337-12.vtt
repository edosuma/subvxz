he was supposed to confess.

- So you whip up some sob story?

If he feels embarrassed
or played, he'll shut down.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.823
The truth is
if you were not cheating,

you would have your accomplice
produce the general's watch.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.729

Patch me through
to Washington now.

But I can't turn on these people
