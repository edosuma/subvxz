WEBVTT

00:01.795 --> 00:03.896
All right, Emma,

00:03.930 --> 00:06.332
a tall one
for the short one.

00:06.417 --> 00:07.583
I'll put it on your tab.

00:08.786 --> 00:11.521
Best tip I've had all day.
Thanks for bringing her by.

00:11.555 --> 00:13.556
No problem.
Fortunately happy hour

00:13.590 --> 00:16.626
is always followed
by nappy hour.

00:16.660 --> 00:19.629
I don't know what Emma's gonna
do with the rest of <i>her</i> day.

00:19.663 --> 00:23.299
Well, I know what I'm gonna
do with the rest of mine.

00:23.333 --> 00:26.436
Hi. Can I get you something
from behind the bar?

00:26.470 --> 00:28.571
And, please,
notice where I'm standing.

00:28.605 --> 00:30.640
Is there anyone else
working here?

00:31.727 --> 00:32.642
I get it.

00:32.676 --> 00:35.378
Funny and handsome--
it's an acquired taste.

00:35.412 --> 00:38.314
- What'll you have?
- An Okiru with a slice of lime.

00:38.348 --> 00:40.550
And I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:41.584 --> 00:42.552
Let me introduce you

00:42.586 --> 00:44.654
to the most popular
new soft drink in Japan.

00:44.688 --> 00:47.423
Oh, you're
a beverage rep!

00:47.458 --> 00:51.360
I should have guessed that when I noticed
your backpack was packing a six-pack.

00:51.395 --> 00:53.663
I'm actually the
North American brand manager.

00:53.697 --> 00:55.631
So what do you say?
You wanna be the first bar

00:55.666 --> 00:57.433
in the city
to get in on this?

00:57.468 --> 00:59.769
I'd say "sure," but around
here I don't call the shots.

00:59.803 --> 01:02.538
- I just pour them.
- Later, bud.

01:02.573 --> 01:04.407
I'll call you
if she walks, talks

01:04.441 --> 01:07.310
or does something disgusting
I'd rather not clean up.

01:07.844 --> 01:09.479
Wait.
I know that face.

01:09.513 --> 01:11.681
New York Rangers.
Something Wheeler, right?

01:11.715 --> 01:14.283
Danny. Unless you're
talking about the baby.

01:14.318 --> 01:16.559
In which case, no, she was
just traded to the Blackhawks.

01:16.587 --> 01:19.455
Oh my God,
he would be perfect.

01:19.490 --> 01:22.592
Okiru is looking for an up-and-coming
athlete to be its new spokesperson.

01:22.626 --> 01:24.727
You want Danny to be
your spokesperson?

01:25.461 --> 01:27.363
That would be amazing...

01:27.397 --> 01:29.298
Not to mention, ka-ching!

01:30.333 --> 01:31.766
You want me to talk
to him for you?

01:31.801 --> 01:34.570
What I want is his manager,
not his bartender.

01:35.305 --> 01:37.540
Hey, I can really help.
That guy loves me like a brother.

01:38.609 --> 01:40.776
And in related news,
he's also my brother.

01:41.811 --> 01:43.579
Oh! Okay.

01:44.614 --> 01:45.648
You really think you could
make this happen?

01:46.382 --> 01:47.717
Let me put it like this:

01:48.751 --> 01:50.553
You've just found yourself
the new face of Okiru

01:50.587 --> 01:52.488
or my name isn't
Ben Wheeler.

01:52.923 --> 01:54.590
By the way,
I'm Ben Wheeler.

01:57.461 --> 02:00.429
<i>â™ª It's amazing</i>
<i>how the unexpected â™ª</i>

02:00.464 --> 02:03.432
<i>â™ª can take your life</i>
<i>and change direction. â™ª</i>

02:03.433 --> 02:07.370
<font color="#ff8c00">Sync & corrections by Alice</font>
<font color="#ff8c00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:07.371 --> 02:10.339
Well, if there's one thing
I know about, it's volunteering.

02:10.374 --> 02:11.541
I've truly done it all.

02:11.575 --> 02:14.310
And not all of it
court-ordered.

02:14.844 --> 02:16.612
Just pick anything.
You can't go wrong.

02:16.647 --> 02:19.448
Okay, what about
working at a soup kitchen?

02:19.483 --> 02:21.517
What else you got?

02:21.552 --> 02:23.553
Uh, reading to the elderly?

02:23.587 --> 02:26.355
Boring!
It's like regular reading,

02:26.390 --> 02:28.424
only slower and louder.

02:29.458 --> 02:31.594
Look, if you're willing
to work for free,

02:31.628 --> 02:35.498
there is some funk in that
shower that just won't quit.

02:35.532 --> 02:38.467
Tucker, I'm doing this
because Fitch has inspired me.

02:38.502 --> 02:41.337
I mean he's off
digging wells in Africa--

02:41.371 --> 02:43.406
you'd think they'd have
enough by now, but.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.508
<i>I just--</i>

02:45.542 --> 02:48.411
I feel like I should
do my part too, you know?

02:48.445 --> 02:50.580
Oh, what about
a candy striper?

02:50.614 --> 02:52.615
Oh, I can help sick people.

02:52.649 --> 02:54.650
And how cute
is this outfit?

02:54.685 --> 02:57.353
I was a candy striper
in high school.

02:57.387 --> 02:59.322
Just be careful
where you nap.

02:59.356 --> 03:01.190
I almost
donated a kidney.

03:02.326 --> 03:04.627
Oooh, a hospital-- cool.

03:04.661 --> 03:07.229
Oh, interesting fact:
I'm actually

03:07.264 --> 03:08.631
one of the few
people in the world

03:08.665 --> 03:11.200
who look good
in fluorescent lighting.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.668
Right?

03:12.703 --> 03:16.572
Everyone stop and remember where you were
at this moment: I have amazing news!

03:16.607 --> 03:19.709
Jon Bon Jovi's single
and he's asking about me.

03:19.743 --> 03:22.411
Even better.
Where's Danny? Danny!

03:22.446 --> 03:24.447
- Danny!
- Yo, what's going on, man?

03:24.481 --> 03:26.349
I, me, Ben,
your one and only brother,

03:26.416 --> 03:28.684
has just landed you
your very first endorsement deal.

03:28.719 --> 03:31.554
You are the new
spokesman for Okiru,

03:31.588 --> 03:34.256
the hottest new
soft drink in the country.

03:34.291 --> 03:35.458
Are you serious?

03:35.492 --> 03:38.427
I've wanted to endorse
something my entire life.

03:38.462 --> 03:40.396
It's true.
When we were kids,

03:40.430 --> 03:44.266
he used to cut out his picture
and paste it on cereal boxes.

03:44.301 --> 03:46.335
He still does that.

03:47.371 --> 03:49.338
"Hi, I'm Danny Wheeler.

03:49.373 --> 03:51.540
Drink this
because I said so."

03:53.477 --> 03:57.346
Whoa whoa whoa.
Slow your roll, Meryl Streep.

03:57.381 --> 03:59.448
Danny's
first endorsement deal

03:59.483 --> 04:02.485
isn't going to be some crappy foreign
soda that nobody's heard of.

04:02.519 --> 04:04.286
Mom, this is
totally legit.

04:04.321 --> 04:06.422
And I think it could be a really
great opportunity for Danny.

04:06.456 --> 04:08.257
And everyone else
on team Wheeler.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.593
And when exactly
did you join team Wheeler?

04:10.627 --> 04:13.663
'Cause I've been to all the meetings
and I've never seen you there.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.199
I'm okay if he joins.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.235
"Drink this.
It's cool.

04:19.269 --> 04:21.303
Just like me--

04:21.338 --> 04:23.305
Danny Wheeler."

04:23.340 --> 04:25.274
See? He's a natural.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.376
Hey, I've been managing
Danny's career

04:27.411 --> 04:29.478
since the very beginning.
Stay out of it, Ben.

04:29.513 --> 04:31.647
I don't tell you how to pour
drinks and pick up girls.

04:31.682 --> 04:34.383
Mom, come on, you know I don't
want to pour drinks forever.

04:34.418 --> 04:36.252
The girl thing, sure.

04:36.286 --> 04:38.254
Yeah.

04:38.288 --> 04:41.457
But you always tell me I need to figure
out my future. Maybe this is it.

04:41.491 --> 04:44.260
I love sports,
people, making money.

04:44.294 --> 04:46.429
I was born
to be Danny's manager.

04:47.464 --> 04:49.498
You were actually
born because the cat

04:49.533 --> 04:52.268
ate my birth-control pills.

04:58.408 --> 05:01.477
Look, sweetie, I'm happy that
you're thinking about your future,

05:01.511 --> 05:03.579
but I don't think
Okiru is the answer.

05:03.613 --> 05:05.581
Mom, come on,
just talk to them.

05:05.615 --> 05:07.550
You don't even know
anything about it.

05:13.457 --> 05:16.258
For one thing
it's super fizzy.

05:20.564 --> 05:23.265
Hi!
Nurse Dalrymple?

05:23.300 --> 05:26.235
Riley Perrin
reporting for duty!

05:26.269 --> 05:29.238
I just want you to know I am ready
to jump in and make a difference.

05:29.272 --> 05:31.407
I was thinking I could
start by cheering up some kids.

05:31.441 --> 05:33.242
You know, maybe a cute
little girl with a lisp

05:33.276 --> 05:35.511
who says something like,
"I wuv you, Wiley."

05:35.545 --> 05:38.214
Or-- Oh oh! Also I aced my C.P.R. test.

05:38.248 --> 05:40.382
- Number one in my class--
- Stop right there.

05:40.417 --> 05:44.286
I really need you to pull
back on the perkiness.

05:44.321 --> 05:45.454
It's nauseating!

05:46.590 --> 05:49.225
Now, this job is simple.

05:49.259 --> 05:51.260
This is
the magazine cart.

05:51.294 --> 05:53.262
You cart it around.

05:53.296 --> 05:55.231
If a patient asks
for a magazine...

05:55.265 --> 05:58.667
Well, if I have to explain this part,
you should probably leave now.

05:58.702 --> 06:00.569
Ooh.

06:00.604 --> 06:03.172
Um, do you have anything
a little more...

06:03.206 --> 06:04.373
Important?

06:04.407 --> 06:06.575
My boyfriend is kind
of the M.V.P. of Do-gooders

06:06.610 --> 06:08.611
and I don't want to sound
all competitive,

06:08.645 --> 06:11.213
but I just don't think
magazines are gonna cut it.

06:11.248 --> 06:13.482
How are you
at cleaning bedpans?

06:14.718 --> 06:17.520
But then again, nothing cheers
people up like literature.

06:19.656 --> 06:21.624
Doctor.

06:21.658 --> 06:24.360
Oh-- Doctor.

06:24.394 --> 06:26.295
- What is going on?
- Uh,

06:26.329 --> 06:28.230
fluorescent lighting,
what did I tell you?

06:30.667 --> 06:32.601
When I said you could
volunteer with me,

06:32.636 --> 06:35.604
- I was under the impression that you were here to do good.
- Do good?

06:35.639 --> 06:38.674
I'm gonna do great in this thing.
You have got to try one of these on.

06:38.708 --> 06:41.343
Doctor.

06:41.378 --> 06:43.579
Tucker, you can't
just steal lab coats.

06:43.613 --> 06:45.447
Or stethoscopes.

06:45.482 --> 06:47.449
Oh no, this is
from the gift shop.

06:48.184 --> 06:50.519
What are you doing? You're supposed
to be passing out magazines,

06:50.554 --> 06:52.388
not flirting
with the staff.

06:52.422 --> 06:54.490
Doctor, I apologize.
She's new.

06:56.426 --> 06:58.327
I agree, nurse.

06:58.361 --> 06:59.695
Don't let it
happen again.

07:05.335 --> 07:09.505
...and I said, "Yes, Officer,
that actually is my Zamboni."

07:11.541 --> 07:14.210
You very very funny.

07:17.247 --> 07:19.281
Things seem
to be going well.

07:19.316 --> 07:22.218
Yeah, I knew as soon as she
sat down and heard the details,

07:22.252 --> 07:23.652
she'd see I was right
all along.

07:28.425 --> 07:30.192
Okay...

07:32.295 --> 07:34.463
Well? Huh? Was I right
or was I right?

07:34.497 --> 07:36.665
Here's a shocker:
You were wrong.

07:36.700 --> 07:39.401
There's no way
Danny's signing this.

07:39.436 --> 07:43.239
What? I haven't seen you laugh that
hard since Dad fell off the roof.

07:43.273 --> 07:45.674
That's because
Mr. Toshi is hilarious.

07:45.709 --> 07:48.344
We're meeting
for Sushi later.

07:48.378 --> 07:51.413
Look, sweetie, this is
Danny's first endorsement.

07:51.448 --> 07:54.350
You only get one chance
at a first time.

07:54.384 --> 07:56.518
Well, actually
I had three,

07:56.553 --> 07:58.621
but that's
another story.

07:58.655 --> 08:00.589
Look, Ben, I'm sorry,

08:00.624 --> 08:04.326
- there's just too many unknowns.
- Mom, come on.

08:04.361 --> 08:05.641
- No.
- Can't we talk about this?

08:05.662 --> 08:07.496
I already made
the poster!

08:10.367 --> 08:13.502
Oh my God,
look at that poster!

08:13.536 --> 08:15.571
I'd buy soda from me.
Does that mean I'm in?

08:17.440 --> 08:19.541
- Working on it.
- But you think it's going to happen, right?

08:19.576 --> 08:23.212
- Well, the thing is...
- Dude, what's the problem? Don't we have a deal?

08:23.246 --> 08:24.413
Not yet.

08:24.447 --> 08:26.282
Aw, man!

08:26.316 --> 08:28.350
I knew you'd never
be able to talk Mom into it.

08:28.385 --> 08:30.286
Wait.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.655
- You didn't think I'd be able to do it?
- It's cool, bro.

08:32.688 --> 08:35.457
Nobody really did,
but I appreciate you trying.

08:37.427 --> 08:39.361
Danny, wait.

08:39.395 --> 08:41.397
When I said not yet,

08:41.431 --> 08:43.465
I meant not yet as in

08:43.500 --> 08:45.334
you just need
to sign the contract,

08:45.368 --> 08:48.537
- if you still want to be the face of Okiru.
- Oh, Ben!

08:48.571 --> 08:51.640
This is amazing! You're
sure Mom's cool with this?

08:52.175 --> 08:54.310
Would I be here
if she wasn't?

08:58.644 --> 09:00.811
Okay. So,
when the director says "Action",

09:00.819 --> 09:02.687
You skate up,
chug the can,

09:02.721 --> 09:04.622
and say your line:
"Okiru, okay!"

09:04.656 --> 09:05.957
Shakira, okay!

09:08.026 --> 09:10.728
- "Okiru, okay."
- Okoolo, okay.

09:10.763 --> 09:13.831
- Come on, man, it's only two words.
- Okey-dokey, okay.

09:15.801 --> 09:17.902
Hey, man, Mom's coming
for the big shoot, right?

09:17.936 --> 09:20.605
- I'm kinda surprised she's not here.
- Well...

09:20.639 --> 09:23.908
That's because she trusts me so much that
she's letting me take the reins on this.

09:23.942 --> 09:26.878
Oh, and she said to tell you she's
so proud of you for listening to me.

09:26.912 --> 09:29.680
- Mom's the best.
- Yeah.

09:29.715 --> 09:32.083
She's definitely something.

09:33.117 --> 09:33.851
Let's try it again.

09:35.854 --> 09:39.724
- Okiru, okay!
- That was perfect. Just like that.

09:39.758 --> 09:42.026
- Keep 'em coming.
- Oh, man, I'm going to be so huge in Japan.

09:42.060 --> 09:43.861
Dude, you're huge
everywhere.

09:45.798 --> 09:47.932
Get plenty of rest

09:49.802 --> 09:52.737
and call this in the morning.

09:52.771 --> 09:55.940
Look, you have a responsibility
to your volunteers.

09:55.974 --> 09:59.811
When your brochure says "make a
difference," that is an implied contract.

09:59.845 --> 10:01.813
And what do you imply
from this?

10:03.782 --> 10:06.684
Please.
I have fluffed pillows

10:06.718 --> 10:09.020
and delivered flowers,
opened blinds, closed blinds.

10:09.054 --> 10:13.124
I-- I am begging you,
just let me save one life.

10:13.158 --> 10:16.027
How about you start
by saving me another walk.

10:16.061 --> 10:17.862
Take this
down to the lab.

10:17.896 --> 10:19.997
Is this something
vital and important?

10:20.032 --> 10:21.799
It was to the guy
it came out of.

10:25.871 --> 10:27.805
I don't get it.
I mean,

10:27.840 --> 10:29.707
what is the point
of volunteering

10:29.741 --> 10:31.976
if you don't even do something
worth bragging about?

10:32.010 --> 10:34.645
Lamest job ever.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.747
Riley, look around.

10:36.782 --> 10:38.983
People are dying,
people are being born.

10:39.017 --> 10:41.018
No one's got the time
to take care of you.

10:42.921 --> 10:45.089
Look, if you want to make
an impact around here,

10:45.123 --> 10:47.725
you need to make
your own opportunities.

10:47.759 --> 10:49.794
Thank you, Tucker.

10:49.828 --> 10:53.865
- You're right.
<i>- Paging Dr. Dobbs. Paging Dr. Dobbs.</i>

10:53.899 --> 10:56.968
And there's my
opportunity right there.

10:59.104 --> 11:00.972
I can't believe it,
this is amazing!

11:01.006 --> 11:02.773
I know,
it's gonna look great.

11:02.808 --> 11:05.042
Once we're done filming Danny,
the special effects department

11:05.077 --> 11:07.979
will fill in the green screen
with 10,000 screaming fans.

11:08.013 --> 11:09.947
Oh, I was talking about
all the free food--

11:09.982 --> 11:11.749
but that's cool too.

11:11.783 --> 11:13.985
And I'm going to go see
if everything's set up.

11:16.955 --> 11:19.590
Danny, you look great.
You doin' okay?

11:19.625 --> 11:22.059
Dude, this is amazing! I feel amazing!
You're amazing!

11:22.094 --> 11:25.062
Okiru-okay! Okiru-okay! Okiru-okay!
Okay! Okay! Okay!

11:25.097 --> 11:27.064
Who wants to watch me skate?

11:29.735 --> 11:31.869
- What is the matter with you?!
- Nothing!

11:31.904 --> 11:33.804
I've never felt better
in my whole life.

11:33.839 --> 11:35.840
This Okiru stuff is incredible!
Did you know

11:35.874 --> 11:38.042
that you're not supposed to drink
more than two of these in 24 hours?

11:38.076 --> 11:40.357
It says right here on the warning label!
I've had like 40!

11:42.547 --> 11:44.949
Whoo, yeah!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!

11:45.984 --> 11:47.752
Whoo!

11:47.786 --> 11:49.107
- April, quick question.
- Uh-huh.

11:49.121 --> 11:51.856
Just curious-- what's the deal
with the warning on the can?

11:51.890 --> 11:54.759
Well, since Okiru is a
highly-potent energy drink,

11:54.793 --> 11:57.762
you don't want people to have too many.
Consumers can be such idiots.

11:57.796 --> 11:59.797
Right, an energy drink.

11:59.831 --> 12:02.767
But don't worry about Danny.
The cans we're using later for filming

12:02.801 --> 12:05.803
- are full of water.
- Perfect.

12:06.837 --> 12:08.606
There's nothing
to worry about.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.961
Oh, I can think
of a thing or two.

12:09.975 --> 12:11.809
Mom!
What are you doing here?

12:11.843 --> 12:14.612
I just got the most
interesting voicemail.

12:14.646 --> 12:17.548
<i>Hi, Mom! It's Danny!</i>
<i>I'm gonna be on TV!</i>

12:17.583 --> 12:21.819
<i>Okay, I gotta call everyone I know.
Okiru-okay hey!</i>

12:21.853 --> 12:23.654
Hey, Tuck.

12:24.189 --> 12:25.723
So I took what
you said to heart

12:25.757 --> 12:27.592
and I made my own
opportunities.

12:27.626 --> 12:30.761
Me too. I stole a year's
supply of these things.

12:32.030 --> 12:35.633
I'm going to cut the fingers
off and make my own condoms.

12:40.005 --> 12:42.940
I figure if I could just
brighten one person's day,

12:42.975 --> 12:44.842
then it would truly be
a job well done.

12:44.876 --> 12:48.813
So Mr. Watkins
in room 423 was so sad.

12:48.847 --> 12:52.883
So I brought him some cookies
and we just sat and talked

12:52.918 --> 12:55.786
- and he completely transformed.
<i>- Oh my God!</i>

12:55.821 --> 12:57.922
<i>Mr. Watkins?</i>
<i>Did someone give you sugar?</i>

12:57.956 --> 13:00.558
Code red, people!
This is not a drill!

13:01.893 --> 13:04.695
Mom, please, just go home.
I've got this under control.

13:04.730 --> 13:06.664
- Hi Mom!
- Hi sweetie!

13:06.698 --> 13:09.700
For the record, that is not
what "under control" looks like.

13:09.735 --> 13:11.869
Is there a problem?
Is Danny okay?

13:11.903 --> 13:14.705
He's fine. He's just
getting himself pumped up!

13:14.740 --> 13:16.674
If we could just
have another minute.

13:17.408 --> 13:19.644
- I swear I can handle this.
- Really?

13:19.678 --> 13:22.813
I just saw him arguing with a
cardboard cutout of himself.

13:22.848 --> 13:24.849
And the cutout
was winning.

13:24.883 --> 13:26.817
Look, I know this is
a big moment for Danny,

13:26.852 --> 13:28.719
and I would never
let him screw this up.

13:28.754 --> 13:30.721
Ben, Danny's not
the problem.

13:30.756 --> 13:33.591
- Look at me, I'm a bee!
- Yes, you are, honey!

13:33.625 --> 13:36.560
Okay, maybe he is the problem, but
you're the one that got him there.

13:36.595 --> 13:38.029
Then let me
try and fix it.

13:38.563 --> 13:40.631
Would it kill you to believe
in me just this once?

13:40.666 --> 13:43.034
- Ben, we're waiting.
- Fine.

13:43.068 --> 13:45.803
You wanna manage,
let's see you manage.

13:45.837 --> 13:47.571
Thank you.

13:47.606 --> 13:50.708
Hey, how many of me do you see?
'Cause I can see three of you.

13:54.012 --> 13:57.048
Danny, look at me.
You need to focus.

13:57.082 --> 13:59.784
This is one of the most
important moments of your life.

13:59.818 --> 14:02.687
Just like we practiced-- you take
a deep breath, you skate up.

14:02.721 --> 14:06.524
Say your line. And you're out.
Can you do it?

14:07.258 --> 14:08.458
I can do it.

14:09.928 --> 14:12.663
Here we go, people.

14:12.698 --> 14:14.699
<i>Okiru-okay,</i>
<i>take one.</i>

14:17.602 --> 14:18.703
Action!

14:22.607 --> 14:23.808
Danny!

14:30.849 --> 14:32.950
Uh... cut?

14:39.421 --> 14:41.356
Oh hey, girl!

14:41.390 --> 14:45.110
Hey, honestly, this place is
the gift that keeps on giving.

14:45.111 --> 14:47.692
I just snagged us dessert
for the next month.

14:49.815 --> 14:50.782
Jell-o cup?

14:54.987 --> 14:56.988
Thanks.
I needed that.

14:58.958 --> 15:01.927
It's nice to see at least somebody's
getting something out of this.

15:01.961 --> 15:03.929
Hey, don't feel bad.

15:03.963 --> 15:06.731
So you don't have anything
to brag about to Fitch.

15:06.766 --> 15:07.966
The guy's still
crazy about you.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.702
I wasn't trying to prove
anything to Fitch.

15:10.736 --> 15:13.772
I was trying
to prove it to myself.

15:13.806 --> 15:16.074
But you know what? Maybe I'm
just not a good person.

15:16.608 --> 15:19.010
And if I'm gonna be
totally honest,

15:19.045 --> 15:20.979
sick people
give me the creeps.

15:22.748 --> 15:26.084
Ugh, I know,
they can be super needy.

15:28.054 --> 15:29.921
So I've decided.
Enough is enough

15:29.956 --> 15:31.890
and I'm going upstairs
to turn in my petticoat.

15:31.924 --> 15:33.091
Oh hey,
while you're up there,

15:33.125 --> 15:35.694
would you mind asking somebody
how many times you can

15:35.728 --> 15:38.768
sit on the X-ray machine before you have
to start worrying about butt-cancer?

15:39.999 --> 15:41.800
Hold the elevator!

15:42.868 --> 15:44.936
Oh my God, Danny!
What happened to him?

15:44.971 --> 15:47.772
- Ben happened to him.
- It's just a concussion.

15:47.807 --> 15:49.941
- If I could slide in here?
- Now everybody out!

15:49.976 --> 15:52.777
This man needs medical attention.
One family member onlyl.

15:52.812 --> 15:54.946
Obviously it should
be the one who gave him life,

15:54.981 --> 15:56.881
not the person who tried
to take it from him.

15:56.916 --> 15:59.050
- I didn't do it on purpose! It could have happened--
- No no no!

15:59.085 --> 16:00.819
Ahhhh!

16:01.921 --> 16:04.089
Well done, Mr. manager.
What next?

16:04.123 --> 16:06.925
Take him outside and throw him
off the parking structure?

16:08.794 --> 16:10.628
God, why isn't
this thing opening?

16:10.663 --> 16:12.797
Quit banging
on all the buttons

16:12.832 --> 16:14.799
or you're gonna...

16:14.834 --> 16:17.902
...do that.

16:17.937 --> 16:19.604
Well, I think
we're stuck.

16:19.638 --> 16:21.806
Oh God, we're not moving.
What are we going to do?

16:21.841 --> 16:24.743
Okay, you know what?
Nothing to panic about.

16:24.777 --> 16:29.014
Just stay calm. I'm sure that this
kind of thing happens all the time.

16:29.048 --> 16:31.850
Um...

16:31.884 --> 16:33.918
I don't mean
to alarm you,

16:33.986 --> 16:36.654
but I'm not getting
a heartbeat.

16:38.891 --> 16:40.859
- Oh my God!
- Help us!

16:40.893 --> 16:42.694
- Please!
- We're stuck in here!

16:42.728 --> 16:44.095
I hate you.

16:44.130 --> 16:46.731
I swear you are
the most incompetent,

16:46.766 --> 16:48.066
- unprofessional--
- Immature?

16:48.100 --> 16:50.735
- Immature...
- Did you already say "unprofessional"?

16:50.770 --> 16:52.737
Yeah... Piece of
work I have ever met.

16:52.772 --> 16:54.773
If I ever get any power,
I swear I will use it

16:54.807 --> 16:57.709
to make sure that you and that
crazy, hyped-up brother of yours

16:57.743 --> 16:59.064
never work
in this business again.

17:02.748 --> 17:05.617
I'm having second thoughts
about this Okiru deal.

17:09.021 --> 17:11.556
Still nothing. Oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God.

17:11.589 --> 17:13.892
- What are we going to do?
- I'll tell you what we're going to do.

17:14.626 --> 17:17.028
We're going to save his life
is what we're going to do.

17:17.063 --> 17:19.631
All right, Tucker, I need
you to get on the phone

17:19.665 --> 17:21.633
and tell them we have
a code blue in elevator "C."

17:21.666 --> 17:24.702
We're going to need oxygen the
second those doors open, stat.

17:24.737 --> 17:26.604
- I said "stat!"
- Oh right, okay.

17:26.638 --> 17:28.706
Oh my God, okay.

17:28.741 --> 17:30.775
Hello?
Please, we need help!

17:30.810 --> 17:31.976
Code blue!

17:32.011 --> 17:33.978
Oh hey, Yvonne!

17:34.013 --> 17:36.581
Yeah.

17:36.615 --> 17:38.917
Compression--
let's do this.

17:39.451 --> 17:41.786
One, two, three, four,

17:41.821 --> 17:42.921
five, six, seven,

17:42.955 --> 17:45.657
eight, nine, 10--
Airway.

17:45.691 --> 17:46.891
Breath.

17:49.595 --> 17:51.963
It's not working!

17:51.997 --> 17:53.798
Come on, Danny,
please wake up.

17:56.068 --> 17:57.836
Riley?

17:59.038 --> 18:01.706
Oh, and I think
he's back.

18:01.740 --> 18:03.741
- Danny!
- Riley!

18:03.776 --> 18:04.876
Oh snap.

18:04.910 --> 18:06.711
Oh!

18:06.745 --> 18:08.012
What's going on?

18:09.882 --> 18:11.716
Not much.
What's going on with you?

18:12.852 --> 18:14.919
I just can't believe
you went behind my back.

18:14.954 --> 18:18.723
I just wanted to do something I could be proud
of, something that Emma could be proud of.

18:18.757 --> 18:20.592
I don't want to be
a bartender forever.

18:20.626 --> 18:22.994
So you thought, "hey, I'll
just become Danny's manager.

18:23.028 --> 18:25.830
I mean if Mom does it,
it can't be that hard."

18:25.865 --> 18:28.833
Ben, Danny and I have been
living and breathing hockey

18:28.868 --> 18:30.802
since he could
pick up a stick.

18:30.836 --> 18:33.037
We are at that rink every day.
Do you know why?

18:33.072 --> 18:34.973
Because it's his job

18:35.007 --> 18:36.941
and you have a lot of time
on your hands?

18:38.611 --> 18:40.979
Because we know that
everything worthwhile

18:41.013 --> 18:43.615
takes time
and commitment.

18:43.649 --> 18:46.050
You want to make Emma proud, then
you need to put in the effort.

18:46.085 --> 18:50.021
It's going to take a lot more
than two days and Dad's old suit.

18:50.055 --> 18:52.023
Mom, I'm sorry.

18:52.057 --> 18:53.992
Do you think Danny
will ever forgive me?

18:54.026 --> 18:57.028
<i>It's opening! Get ready.</i>

18:57.062 --> 18:58.997
- I need some help here.
- Wait!

19:00.766 --> 19:03.601
I can see the headlines now:

19:03.636 --> 19:06.771
"New York Ranger
saves candy striper."

19:06.805 --> 19:09.874
And that, Ben,
is how you manage.

19:13.979 --> 19:15.947
Huh, that's weird.

19:15.981 --> 19:17.916
I don't have
a heartbeat either.

19:20.052 --> 19:22.820
<i>- Peas or carrots?</i>
<i>- Peas, please.</i>

19:27.726 --> 19:29.761
Thanks for saving
my life.

19:29.795 --> 19:32.030
Even though it didn't
actually need saving.

19:32.064 --> 19:33.998
Oh, happy to come
to your rescue.

19:34.033 --> 19:37.669
I just-- I wish I could remember
more of what happened, you know?

19:37.703 --> 19:39.604
Tucker said you didn't
have a heartbeat

19:39.638 --> 19:42.319
and the next thing I knew, you were
carrying me out of the elevator.

19:44.009 --> 19:46.578
What do you remember?

19:47.746 --> 19:50.648
Nothing really.
Just coming to

19:50.683 --> 19:52.717
and seeing you
laying there on the ground.

19:55.921 --> 19:57.889
Well, I should
probably call Fitch.

19:57.923 --> 19:59.891
Oh yeah. I'm sure he'll
be excited to hear

19:59.925 --> 20:02.060
- about all the good you're doing.
- Yeah.

20:02.094 --> 20:04.028
I might leave
a few parts out.

20:06.799 --> 20:08.600
Uh, I'm just gonna...

20:09.702 --> 20:10.835
Yeah.

20:12.000 --> 20:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:19.111 --> 20:21.980
So, how's she doing?
Does she remember anything?

20:22.014 --> 20:23.881
Thankfully no.

20:23.916 --> 20:25.984
And neither do you.
Got it?

20:26.018 --> 20:28.753
Got it.

20:28.787 --> 20:31.889
- What's that?
-  It's a pager.

20:33.058 --> 20:34.759
I'm on call.

20:37.896 --> 20:39.764
What the--?

20:41.623 --> 20:43.395
These things are amazing.

20:43.421 --> 20:45.458
You are gonna be so rich!

20:45.493 --> 20:48.628
Oh my gosh, you know I don't normally
date guys that are shorter than me,

20:48.663 --> 20:51.498
but I promise you,
I'm totally worth the climb.

20:52.767 --> 20:54.501
I'm sorry, that is
just a little joke.

20:54.535 --> 20:55.702
I mean not little
like you're little.

20:55.736 --> 20:57.604
But seriously, you could
probably save money

20:57.638 --> 20:58.738
if you shopped
in the junior department.

Mr. Toshi, Mr. Toshi,
that's a funny name.

21:01.342 --> 21:03.510
Oh my gosh, Mr. Toshi,
I just realized your nickname

21:03.544 --> 21:05.612
could be "Mr. T"!

21:05.646 --> 21:07.547
"I pity the fool that
doesn't drink Okiru!

21:07.581 --> 21:09.382
Don't give me
no jibber-jabber!"

21:09.417 --> 21:11.351
Mmm, mmm.

21:11.885 --> 21:14.254
Uh, you know what?
Screw it.
