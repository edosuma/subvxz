gunner from last year

you need to take it up

27:14.867 --> 27:16.266
With the buyer, not me.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.002
- No, we did already,
and he said that I could

27:18.137 --> 27:19.970
Pay him for the cost
of the horse.

run game against the sox.

on this trailer.

- I don't know
what to tell you.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.346

But there was a black stallion
kicking up a fuss in the back.

28:45.758 --> 28:48.224
He was gonna hurt himself,
or one of the other horses,

28:48.260 --> 28:50.426
So, I opened up the back
to check on him,

28:50.463 --> 28:52.296
He made a run for it.

28:52.431 --> 28:53.964

28:54.099 --> 28:55.966

mangy beast.

to anybody.

these other horses?

We can't just leave them
on the trailer.

like you.

That really means a lot.

31:09.234 --> 31:10.667
But?

31:10.736 --> 31:13.036
- But, I've been going over
our kids' rodeo standings,

31:13.171 --> 31:15.973
And their points are way down
over last year.

31:15.975 --> 31:18.408
- Yeah, I'd be lying
if I said I hadn't noticed

31:18.410 --> 31:20.110
They've been bringing home
fewer buckles lately.

31:20.179 --> 31:21.578
- You see, the thing
about teenagers is,

31:21.647 --> 31:24.514
Every once in a while you gotta
light a fire under their butts.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.651
If you're too nice to 'em,
they're gonna slack off.

31:27.786 --> 31:29.653
- So, I need to be tougher
on them.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.721
- No, I think you should do
exactly what you've been doin'.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.526
No, they need a guy like you
in their lives, inspiring them.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.728
But they also need
a guy like me.

31:38.764 --> 31:41.131

about being liked.

You build 'em up,

- No, I nudge 'em a little.
- Nudge.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.582
