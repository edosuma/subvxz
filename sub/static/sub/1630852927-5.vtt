00:11.845 --> 00:14.305
What are you talking about?
I thought you were on your way.

00:14.389 --> 00:18.017
<i>I was, but one of the boys I'm in charge
of got involved in an assault case.</i>

00:18.101 --> 00:19.853
<i>All the officers on the night shift
are at the scene.</i>

00:19.936 --> 00:20.770
What about us?

00:20.854 --> 00:23.773
<i>Even if we do go,
it'll be hard to find them.</i>

00:24.315 --> 00:26.109
<i>If it's seven kids we have to look for,</i>

00:26.192 --> 00:30.238
<i>we're going to need more manpower.
You know better than anyone</i>

00:30.321 --> 00:33.158
<i>that we are each in charge
of over 100 kids.</i>

00:34.409 --> 00:36.578
<i>We're short-staffed as is.</i>

00:36.661 --> 00:38.580
<i>After I take care of this,</i>

00:38.663 --> 00:41.875
<i>I'll check the available officers
in the jurisdiction and call you.</i>

00:41.958 --> 00:43.209
Wait. Hello…

00:47.297 --> 00:48.381
See?

00:49.090 --> 00:50.759
See what you've done?

00:50.842 --> 00:52.469
Why don't you
just report this to the police--

00:52.552 --> 00:53.803
And say what?

00:54.804 --> 00:57.682
You're the one who chased them away?
Should I tell them that?

01:04.522 --> 01:06.066
Tell me where else they might be.

01:07.442 --> 01:08.693
That's it.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.363
We're not in Seoul.

01:12.447 --> 01:15.617
If you haven't found them by now,
you'll never find them.

01:25.668 --> 01:28.463
I see you were admitted several times
due to thyroid problems.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.590
Your hormone levels are below normal.

01:30.673 --> 01:33.301
Have you been
under a lot of stress lately?

01:34.803 --> 01:36.221
No, not really.

01:36.304 --> 01:39.057
What about your medication?
You haven't been taking it, have you?

01:40.350 --> 01:42.560
Well… I tried.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.480
If you keep skipping your meds,
your health will get worse.

01:45.563 --> 01:48.274
If your hormone levels drop more,
I'm going to admit you.

01:49.442 --> 01:53.029
You can go home for the day.
Make sure to get plenty of rest.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.572
-Okay.
-Thank you.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.576
Come on, Mom.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.204
I'm okay.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.998
I don't know what to say.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.458
Why?

02:06.334 --> 02:08.086
We're the ones who are in the wrong.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.963
I'm just so embarrassed.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.509
I heard you used the money for surgery.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.973
Yu-gyeong told me everything.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.269
About life at the center
and the court subsidies.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.650
You should have reported it to the court.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.114
Yes. I know.

02:42.495 --> 02:43.746
Yes, Judge Sim?

02:44.247 --> 02:46.583
I called you, but you didn't pick up…

02:50.545 --> 02:51.588
What?

02:52.297 --> 02:56.217
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS FOUNDING CELEBRATION

03:08.938 --> 03:09.856
A-reum.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.859
A-reum!

03:13.610 --> 03:14.944
Careful, A-jin.

03:29.584 --> 03:30.460
A-reum.

03:31.502 --> 03:32.420
A-reum!

03:42.680 --> 03:43.640
-A-reum.
-Mom.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.724
Are you okay?

03:47.018 --> 03:49.604
A-reum. It's not true, is it?

03:49.687 --> 03:53.942
I must have misheard. You couldn't have.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.027
Why would you do that?

03:56.110 --> 03:57.153
It was me.

04:00.031 --> 04:02.325
I kicked those pests out.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.788
And it felt good.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.041
Kim A-reum.

04:10.541 --> 04:14.212
Don't you remember, Mom?

04:14.712 --> 04:17.382
Those bitches were using you.

04:17.465 --> 04:21.094
That's all you get after cooking meals
for them and doing their laundry.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.390
Mom, you're the one who has to wake up!

04:25.473 --> 04:26.933
What are you, a pushover?

04:27.016 --> 04:31.521
You even collapsed because of them,
so why are you looking for them?

04:33.147 --> 04:34.691
Who cares if they're gone?

04:35.191 --> 04:37.443
What's so bad about kicking them out?

04:37.944 --> 04:40.488
What does it matter
if those bitches live or die?

04:40.571 --> 04:41.447
Enough!

04:44.617 --> 04:48.329
I told you to watch your mouth.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.416
I told you to watch what you say!

04:51.499 --> 04:52.667
Mom.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.585
Seriously…

04:54.669 --> 04:55.962
That's enough.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.924
Take your sister and go upstairs.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.218
-Why should I?
-I'm not playing with you.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.198
Seven kids just disappeared.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.285
What will you do about this?

05:29.287 --> 05:30.663
How could this have happened?

05:34.125 --> 05:35.710
Judge Sim, we should start looking for--

05:35.793 --> 05:37.211
We won't find them.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.672
We're talking about seven kids.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.551
We gave them a reason to run away
and they don't want to be found.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.595
I'm sorry.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.847
-Whatever it takes--
-Yes.

05:48.514 --> 05:49.766
You must find them

05:51.768 --> 05:53.186
whatever it takes.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.331
Min-gyeong.

06:13.414 --> 06:14.791
-Min-gyeong.
-Ms. O.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.002
Oh gosh. It's okay.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.170
What happened?

06:19.253 --> 06:22.548
We were patrolling the neighborhood
and found her crying alone.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.383
She seemed to be from the center.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.761
What's this? How did this happen?

06:26.844 --> 06:28.012
It was…

06:29.097 --> 06:30.890
Yeong-na.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.893
If you don't want to go then get lost,
you fucking bitch.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.436
I can't walk anymore!

06:38.147 --> 06:39.565
You have some money, right?

06:40.900 --> 06:41.943
Hand it over.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.569
-Give it up.
-Ji-eun!

06:43.653 --> 06:45.363
-Fuck!
-Let go of me!

06:45.446 --> 06:47.156
-Let's just go!
-Let me go!

06:49.909 --> 06:52.161
So where did they go?

06:52.912 --> 06:56.332
I don't know. They said
they're going to some train station.

07:08.302 --> 07:11.889
If they really left the area,
they'll contact someone they're close to.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.935
They don't have money
and they'll need a place to stay tonight.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.939
When you get to the center, call their
legal guardians and their friends.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.693
Judge Cha and I will call the court
that appointed Pureum Home for Girls.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.196
That'll be a bit difficult.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.783
It's getting pretty late.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.913
I'll call the kids
as soon as the sun comes up.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.458
You two should be getting back.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.585
You have to go to work tomorrow.

07:40.668 --> 07:43.754
Yes, we have to report to
Presiding Judge Kang too.

07:57.977 --> 07:58.811
Here.

08:01.689 --> 08:02.690
Gosh.

08:09.405 --> 08:13.743
If we give our report in the morning,
a court investigator might visit you.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.914
Don't try to protect the kids by
withholding information. Just be honest.

08:18.581 --> 08:19.582
All right.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.835
You should go get some rest. You're ill.

08:22.919 --> 08:23.961
Drive safely.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.671
Let's go.

08:29.091 --> 08:31.219
It's okay.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.054
-Bye.
-Bye.

08:43.856 --> 08:44.899
We'll be able

08:46.484 --> 08:47.860
to find the kids, right?

09:24.939 --> 09:25.815
Mom.

09:25.898 --> 09:26.941
Yes?

09:34.365 --> 09:35.616
What do I do?

09:46.085 --> 09:47.044
Goodness.

09:56.637 --> 09:57.638
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

09:57.722 --> 10:01.058
What are you talking about?
What do you mean the kids disappeared?

10:01.142 --> 10:02.602
There was a fight at the center,

10:03.352 --> 10:05.563
and all the kids were kicked out.

10:06.814 --> 10:07.690
What?

10:07.773 --> 10:10.901
A local police station found
one of the seven kids and--

10:10.985 --> 10:12.862
We investigated the lead you
wanted us to bury.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.741
In doing so, we found cases of assault
that were never reported

10:16.824 --> 10:19.368
and found out that
court subsidies were used illicitly.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.704
Well, technically it wasn't illicit.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.497
It was used for a victim's surgery--

10:23.581 --> 10:25.458
Hold on. Wait.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.836
To sum it up,

10:28.919 --> 10:31.589
you defied a direct order, conducted
an investigation and this happened?

10:32.632 --> 10:33.799
Is that right?

10:35.468 --> 10:36.302
Yes, sir.

10:37.094 --> 10:38.262
You imbeciles!

10:39.055 --> 10:41.849
I told you not to, didn't I?
I made myself very clear!

10:43.100 --> 10:45.978
Six kids are missing. Six!

10:47.355 --> 10:50.066
What will you do about it?
How are you going to handle it?

10:50.900 --> 10:54.070
Both we and the center will cooperate
with the probation office

10:54.945 --> 10:56.280
and find them no matter what.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.365
Find them!

10:57.448 --> 10:59.659
You made this mess, so you clean it up.

11:02.286 --> 11:03.496
Gosh, what…

11:04.872 --> 11:05.998
How…

11:06.082 --> 11:07.708
Get out! I don't want to see your faces!

11:14.256 --> 11:16.592
Pureum hasn't called yet?

11:16.676 --> 11:20.096
Yes. Maybe she's still making calls.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.227
The longer they're on the streets,

11:26.769 --> 11:29.939
the more money they will need.
And they'll succumb to temptation.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.984
Juvenile crimes aren't just committed.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.905
It's something they sink into.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.160
You have a trial today, right?

11:43.244 --> 11:45.830
You should get ready.
I'll keep thinking about it.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.340
Judge Sim, I'll be going now.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.974
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

12:14.984 --> 12:17.278
Judge Sim, what do we do?

12:17.945 --> 12:20.322
The kids…

12:21.157 --> 12:25.536
The defendant apologized to the victim,
made financial compensations,

12:25.619 --> 12:27.329
and is repenting deeply.

12:29.081 --> 12:33.377
I hereby sentence
probation numbers one, three, and four.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.171
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.797
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.048
Ma'am. This way.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.009
-Okay.
-You can go that way.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.261
Judge Cha.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.848
We just got an urgent message.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.059
Yes. I'm on my way.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.853
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.313
Judge Sim!

12:54.064 --> 12:55.524
I heard you got a call from Yeon-ji.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.703
Hello?

13:09.788 --> 13:12.374
Who is it? Yeong-na?

13:12.458 --> 13:13.792
Yeon-ji?

13:13.876 --> 13:14.919
Who is this?

13:18.255 --> 13:20.508
If you're not going to talk,
I'm hanging up.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.593
<i>It's me, Yeon-ji.</i>

13:30.351 --> 13:31.227
<i>Hello?</i>

13:31.936 --> 13:33.020
<i>Hello?</i>

13:33.103 --> 13:34.522
I'm here.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.566
You're alone, right?

13:38.150 --> 13:40.611
I was going to hang up if it wasn't you.

13:40.694 --> 13:44.615
Everyone's outside.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.992
You know how Ms. O is like.

13:47.535 --> 13:52.122
<i>I hit you and stole your money
because of that crazy bitch Yeong-na.</i>

13:52.206 --> 13:54.458
<i>You know what she's like
when she goes crazy.</i>

13:54.542 --> 13:56.710
I only pretended to hit you.

13:58.045 --> 13:58.963
I know.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.590
I didn't know when we were at the center,

14:01.674 --> 14:04.426
but the girls here are totally nuts.

14:04.927 --> 14:08.556
They're so on edge that they have shifts
to keep guard so no one runs away.

14:11.141 --> 14:14.895
I snuck away from Yeong-na
while buying drinks to call you.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.816
So what are you going to do now?

14:18.899 --> 14:20.943
<i>That's why I'm calling you.</i>

14:21.819 --> 14:23.445
Help me.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.616
<i>She went to Seoul with the kids,</i>

14:28.284 --> 14:33.414
and they're forcing her into prostitution
today at 6 p.m.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.334
She wanted help
because she's the first to go.

14:37.835 --> 14:38.919
Place?

14:39.003 --> 14:40.838
I don't know the exact location.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.382
She just said a motel near Seoul Station.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.262
We have to save her.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.557
Things have gotten way out of hand.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.893
I don't know what to do.

14:53.976 --> 14:58.522
When a kid on probation goes missing,
the judge in charge is also in trouble.

15:00.858 --> 15:01.901
Do you know why?

15:03.360 --> 15:05.696
Well, if a kid runs away--

15:05.779 --> 15:07.823
Because it could lead to prostitution!

15:08.699 --> 15:10.868
Because that's the only way
they can make money.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.411
Because that's the easiest.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.625
This is what happens to kids you kick out.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.546
We can't lose her this time.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.341
We'll ask the probation office
for cooperation.

15:26.258 --> 15:30.179
We'll catch O Yeon-ji today,
as well as the others.

15:33.849 --> 15:36.185
Yes, did you get the photo
and the report we sent?

15:36.268 --> 15:38.729
There are in total six kids
we need to save.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.941
O Yeon-ji, a 14-year-old girl,
is a victim of forced prostitution.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.735
-What should we do with the money?
-Beef.

15:44.818 --> 15:47.821
<i>The other runaways are 15-year-olds,
Ko Hye-rim, Yeo Ji-eun</i>

15:50.366 --> 15:52.117
<i>Han Min-ju, and Yun Eun-jeong.</i>

15:53.702 --> 15:57.039
<i>And their de facto leader
is 16-year-old Choi Yeong-na.</i>

16:01.669 --> 16:04.546
<i>We have to save them no matter what.</i>

16:07.007 --> 16:08.300
Yes, this is Sim Eun-seok.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.302
Can you do me a favor?

16:34.535 --> 16:35.536
Damn.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.265
Should I shower first?

16:57.725 --> 16:58.767
Well…

16:59.643 --> 17:01.061
Sure, I guess.

17:20.414 --> 17:23.417
What are you doing? Why…

17:27.796 --> 17:30.549
There are a lot of girls
who run away with just my money.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.515
MOTEL

17:44.229 --> 17:45.647
Welcome.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.691
A violation of the
Juvenile Protection Act has been reported.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.068
We need to check the security footage.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.322
Of course.

17:53.405 --> 17:54.406
Go ahead.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.371
Can we check the view of the street?

18:01.455 --> 18:03.165
-This street?
-Yes.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.965
Excuse me, have you seen this girl?

18:12.049 --> 18:14.343
Have you seen a bunch
of high school girls? This is them.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.427
No, I haven't.

18:17.679 --> 18:18.555
MOTEL

18:25.813 --> 18:27.731
We're headed towards where the motels are.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.627
HOTEL

18:53.173 --> 18:55.509
MOTEL

19:09.523 --> 19:10.816
Want something to drink?

19:11.775 --> 19:13.277
Ms. O will be here soon.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.367
Ms. Joo, what are you doing here?

19:20.450 --> 19:22.661
Just… No reason.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.342
-Nothing.
-Let's move on.

19:39.803 --> 19:40.804
Yes, Judge Sim?

19:41.513 --> 19:45.601
We checked all the security cameras
in the area but found nothing.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.269
What about you?

19:47.352 --> 19:49.146
There are a few motels left to check,

19:50.272 --> 19:51.732
but nothing so far.

19:51.815 --> 19:55.152
We're going to the motel street
in a nearby district.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.030
We'll keep looking and let you know.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.073
This is so much fun, right?

20:00.157 --> 20:00.991
Hey!

20:01.074 --> 20:01.950
-What?
-Come on.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.243
What is it?

20:03.327 --> 20:04.786
What's your deal, bitch?

20:04.870 --> 20:07.122
-It's the judge.
-What judge?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.374
The guy judge we saw at Pureum, moron.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.834
He just passed by.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.630
Looks like a cop next to him.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.341
Damn it! How did he know we were here?

20:17.424 --> 20:18.759
That's what I'm saying.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.010
-Hey.
-What?

20:20.093 --> 20:23.138
Shit. Ko Hye-rim and Ji-eun also know?

20:28.518 --> 20:29.561
Hye-rim.

20:30.729 --> 20:31.647
Ji-eun.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.067
Are you kids okay?

20:37.569 --> 20:39.363
You shouldn't be doing this.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.740
You shouldn't be here.

20:41.823 --> 20:42.741
No.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.869
If we get caught now…

20:46.662 --> 20:47.704
Come with me.

20:48.455 --> 20:49.831
Run!

20:51.124 --> 20:52.209
Hye-rim!

20:54.127 --> 20:55.295
Move!

20:55.379 --> 20:56.380
Hye-rim!

20:57.381 --> 20:58.423
No!

20:58.507 --> 20:59.341
Damn.

21:01.969 --> 21:02.928
No!

21:34.001 --> 21:34.960
What?

21:35.043 --> 21:36.628
Fuck.

21:59.776 --> 22:00.902
Fuck.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.239
-Hye-rim!
-Hey! Move!

22:04.323 --> 22:07.075
-Hye-rim!
-Move!

22:07.659 --> 22:09.411
-No.
-Let go of me!

22:14.416 --> 22:15.334
Hye-rim.

22:16.209 --> 22:17.419
No.

22:17.502 --> 22:18.420
Hye-rim.

22:18.503 --> 22:20.672
-No.
-Let go of me!

22:20.756 --> 22:22.341
Damn!

22:22.424 --> 22:24.009
Come on!

22:24.801 --> 22:25.969
Seriously!

22:29.181 --> 22:30.140
Hye-rim.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.393
Where's Yeon-ji?

22:41.151 --> 22:43.236
You bitch. Are you playing with me?

22:44.112 --> 22:45.363
You playing with me?

22:45.447 --> 22:47.324
Come here!

22:47.866 --> 22:49.659
How dare you…

22:51.495 --> 22:54.039
You bitch! You think this is a joke?

22:58.794 --> 23:01.713
I'd like to see a list of rooms
that are currently occupied.

23:07.969 --> 23:09.221
Sorry.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.348
Thank you.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.399
Take another step. I dare you.

23:21.900 --> 23:25.695
The moment you do, I'm going to
kill myself and you're going to jail.

23:26.822 --> 23:29.157
You fucking bitch. Put that down.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.575
Don't give me that bullshit.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.744
Go right ahead.
Go ahead and stab yourself.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.456
We're from Yeonhwa Police Station.

23:36.540 --> 23:39.918
We received a report of violation of
the Juvenile Protection Act.

23:40.001 --> 23:41.378
Help me!

23:42.838 --> 23:44.714
Shut up!

23:45.257 --> 23:47.509
Open the door! Yeon-ji!

23:48.844 --> 23:49.719
O Yeon-ji!

23:49.803 --> 23:51.388
Shut up!

23:51.471 --> 23:52.722
O Yeon-ji!

23:53.849 --> 23:55.183
Yeon-ji, are you in there?

24:03.441 --> 24:04.651
Yeon-ji!

24:05.694 --> 24:06.653
Open the door!

24:07.863 --> 24:09.281
Stay quiet.

24:26.464 --> 24:27.757
Get down!

24:29.551 --> 24:30.677
Let go!

24:33.096 --> 24:35.932
You're under arrest for violation of
the Juvenile Protection Act.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.143
-No!
-You have the right to an attorney

24:38.226 --> 24:40.061
and the right to remain silent.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.439
Even if you refuse to make a statement,
it won't be used against you.

24:42.522 --> 24:45.817
But anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.883
This is why we live by the law.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.220
For your own good.

25:16.056 --> 25:19.226
I thought I was going to die.

25:30.278 --> 25:32.822
We don't have a lot of time.
Get dressed and come out.

25:44.584 --> 25:45.710
You must be tired.

25:47.128 --> 25:50.715
I just talked to Judge Sim.
They found the kids.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.175
Thank goodness.

25:53.510 --> 25:54.719
They found them.

25:57.597 --> 25:58.682
Great work.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.642
Judge Sim. I'll see you there.

26:03.561 --> 26:04.729
Yeon-ji.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.108
It's okay. Don't worry.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.365
Hye-rim. Eun-jeong.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.828
Sir. Let's go.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.204
Ko Gang-sik.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.373
-I thought you're buying drinks.
-Be right there!

26:28.086 --> 26:30.588
Thank you for helping us on your day off.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.924
To be honest, I wasn't expecting much.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.801
I mean, you helped us last time,

26:34.884 --> 26:37.304
but it's not like
you were interested in juvenile cases.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.346
I know.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.349
You give me nothing but trouble,
Judge Sim.

26:42.350 --> 26:43.393
Great work today.

26:45.729 --> 26:48.440
And from now on, just call me once.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.154
Let's go.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.160
What's going to happen to the kids?

27:00.243 --> 27:03.330
Yeon-ji will be placed in
a juvenile classification center.

27:03.413 --> 27:04.956
Getting therapy should come first.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.085
The rest of the kids will be investigated
by the police.

27:11.379 --> 27:14.382
I haven't seen Yeong-na yet.

27:15.050 --> 27:15.884
I know.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.931
<i>A-reum gave her statement
while we were chasing the kids.</i>

27:22.015 --> 27:24.809
<i>She told us where Yeong-na is.</i>

27:25.852 --> 27:28.897
How did A-reum know…

27:28.980 --> 27:31.775
There's a very talented judicial mediator
in our court.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.277
I asked for her help in advance.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.363
You must've been shocked.

27:37.405 --> 27:40.367
You don't have to worry about your mom.

27:40.950 --> 27:43.078
I've been working here for ten years.

27:43.161 --> 27:46.373
I can tell right away
that this is not a big deal.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.793
I'm saying it's nothing. It's okay.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.256
-Put that away.
-Okay.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.343
And this isn't an official investigation.

27:58.426 --> 28:03.556
We're just checking the facts
so there's no need to feel pressured.

28:04.140 --> 28:07.102
But the result will be reported
to Judge Sim and Judge Cha

28:07.185 --> 28:09.854
so if you feel like
you'll be put at a disadvantage

28:09.938 --> 28:12.023
or if you don't want to say,
you don't have to.

28:13.858 --> 28:17.529
So can you tell me
what happened at the center

28:18.196 --> 28:19.406
that day?

28:22.492 --> 28:23.493
<i>Wait.</i>

28:24.619 --> 28:28.873
Are you saying that
A-reum covered for Yeong-na?

28:28.957 --> 28:32.585
She's the one who kicked her out.
Why would she?

28:32.669 --> 28:36.256
Then how did she know?

28:37.465 --> 28:38.508
<i>She called.</i>

28:39.509 --> 28:41.136
I need help.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.054
Where are you?

28:43.722 --> 28:44.639
Are you alone?

28:44.723 --> 28:45.682
Hey.

28:48.476 --> 28:50.353
Fuck. Who are you calling?

28:50.437 --> 28:51.938
<i>No. It's not what it looks like.</i>

28:52.021 --> 28:54.190
-Hello? Hello?
<i>-You fucking bitch.</i>

28:54.274 --> 28:56.067
Yeon-ji, are you okay?

28:56.651 --> 28:58.236
Yeon-ji, that moron

28:59.237 --> 29:02.073
got caught by Yeong-na when she called.

29:02.157 --> 29:05.577
And Min-gyeong wasn't of much help,

29:07.537 --> 29:09.789
so I just took the phone
and convinced her.

29:10.790 --> 29:12.083
Convinced her?

29:14.711 --> 29:15.628
Or was it a threat?

29:17.213 --> 29:18.965
I know her weakness.

29:19.632 --> 29:20.800
Her mom.

29:22.343 --> 29:24.637
She loves her mom to bits,

29:25.346 --> 29:28.308
but her mom left a year ago.

29:28.975 --> 29:33.021
A while back,
her mom called telling us she was sick.

29:33.104 --> 29:37.942
So Yeong-na should go to her uncle's
house when she gets out.

29:38.651 --> 29:40.987
So, I used that.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.114
Do you want to fucking die?

29:44.866 --> 29:47.410
Hey, say that again.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.332
What about my mom?

29:55.335 --> 29:58.588
So go find your mom, you crazy bitch.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.840
Pimping isn't what's important.

30:01.382 --> 30:04.219
Your mom might die any day now.

30:06.930 --> 30:09.057
Yeong-na probably went to find her mom.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.601
Her mom who's always been unwell.

30:15.313 --> 30:19.609
But wait, Judge Sim.

30:19.692 --> 30:24.614
Yes, Yeong-na's mom was
the only one who didn't pick up.

30:26.074 --> 30:28.076
So we have to find Yeong-na.

30:29.702 --> 30:31.454
Whatever it takes.

30:33.414 --> 30:34.415
No matter what.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.396
Who are you?

30:56.479 --> 30:58.231
We're from Yeonhwa District Court.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.651
Are you Choi Yeong-na's mother?

31:01.734 --> 31:02.735
Who?

31:03.361 --> 31:04.404
Yeong-na.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.447
Choi Yeong-na.

31:07.073 --> 31:10.201
No. I don't have a child by that name.

31:11.786 --> 31:14.664
Maybe the girl from before?

31:15.540 --> 31:17.750
Some girl came here.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.184
Oh my.

31:37.353 --> 31:38.271
Choi Yeong-na.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.565
Yeong-na.

31:44.485 --> 31:46.321
Oh, my. What's going on?

31:46.988 --> 31:49.449
What happened?

31:50.533 --> 31:52.243
What are you doing here?

31:55.288 --> 31:57.624
Did you meet your mom?

32:01.210 --> 32:02.086
My mom?

32:05.089 --> 32:06.132
Who is it?

32:18.061 --> 32:19.103
Mom.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.859
Honey, who is it?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.736
No one.

32:32.659 --> 32:35.328
Some kid came to the wrong house.

32:57.183 --> 32:59.143
She wasn't sick.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.814
She lied so she could abandon me.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.525
Fuck.

33:07.694 --> 33:08.820
My mom…

33:11.072 --> 33:12.198
What kind of mom…

33:20.873 --> 33:22.291
It's okay, Yeong-na.

33:50.737 --> 33:53.698
It's okay. You can cry.

33:55.408 --> 33:57.660
<i>Yes, Judge Sim. Where's Yeong-na?</i>

33:57.744 --> 34:00.038
I turned her over to the juvenile
classification center.

34:00.121 --> 34:02.915
Both her physical
and mental state is a mess.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.209
Come to the courthouse.

34:05.293 --> 34:06.377
<i>Okay, I will.</i>

34:10.131 --> 34:11.090
Are you worried?

34:12.717 --> 34:14.343
You must know well that

34:15.053 --> 34:17.138
most kids who get sent to us

34:17.930 --> 34:19.766
don't have a good family background.

34:21.559 --> 34:25.354
I thought I'd be used to it by now,

34:26.439 --> 34:27.690
but it's hard every time.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.443
I am especially worried

34:32.028 --> 34:33.863
about what will happen to Yeong-na.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.872
-Here. Let me get that.
-Okay.

34:42.955 --> 34:45.166
Hey, if you meet a guy like your dad,
you'll be in trouble.

34:45.249 --> 34:46.167
Really?

34:47.960 --> 34:50.671
-Gosh, Mom.
-Thank you.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.048
-Bye.
-Bye.

34:52.131 --> 34:53.341
Let's go.

35:11.067 --> 35:14.028
Open the door. Open the fucking door!

35:14.112 --> 35:15.446
You bitch!

35:18.282 --> 35:19.659
Open the fucking door!

35:21.619 --> 35:23.079
Fucking open it!

35:24.789 --> 35:27.083
Hey, who the hell are you?

35:27.166 --> 35:29.836
-Why are you causing such a ruckus?
-You fucking bitch! Get out here!

35:29.919 --> 35:31.712
What the hell? Piss off.

35:33.464 --> 35:35.007
-Get out of my way. Get out!
-Hey!

36:09.000 --> 36:13.254
<i>When Juveniles get hurt from home,
they start to abuse themselves…</i>

36:18.634 --> 36:21.179
<i>by committing a crime
that they normally wouldn't,</i>

36:21.262 --> 36:22.805
<i>or by associating themselves
with the wrong crowd.</i>

36:24.849 --> 36:28.060
<i>The truth is they know themselves
that they shouldn't</i>

36:28.561 --> 36:29.937
<i>but they do it anyway.</i>

36:32.106 --> 36:35.026
Because they hope hurting themselves

36:36.235 --> 36:38.279
would also hurt their families as well.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.907
I want to report corruption.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.995
Pureum Home for Girls.

36:51.375 --> 36:52.919
They want to be noticed.

36:54.629 --> 36:55.880
They want others to know

36:57.798 --> 36:59.258
they're having a hard time.

37:04.805 --> 37:08.309
The start of most misconduct
is the family.

37:10.394 --> 37:13.022
I didn't intend to kick them out at first.

37:13.981 --> 37:16.943
I just wanted the center to go bankrupt.

37:19.195 --> 37:20.613
If it went out of business,

37:22.031 --> 37:23.866
my dad could come back.

37:25.076 --> 37:27.620
Mom. Wake up. Mom!

37:27.703 --> 37:30.122
Mom, wake up.
Mom, what's wrong? Are you okay?

37:30.206 --> 37:33.876
Hey! A-jin! Get out here!

37:33.960 --> 37:37.880
But I had no idea my mom would collapse.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.634
If something happens to her because of me…

37:43.803 --> 37:44.804
It's…

37:46.889 --> 37:47.848
It was…

37:50.393 --> 37:51.644
so scary.

37:58.067 --> 37:59.777
Yes, you must've been startled.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.659
But why did you kick out the kids?

38:12.707 --> 38:15.251
It's okay. You can tell me.

38:18.587 --> 38:20.589
<i>Are you at the hospital? What about Mom?</i>

38:21.340 --> 38:23.968
<i>A-jin, what did the doctors say?</i>

38:25.636 --> 38:26.679
<i>Is Mom okay?</i>

38:27.972 --> 38:30.308
<i>A-jin, is Mom okay?</i>

38:31.684 --> 38:35.187
Fuck. This is hilarious.

38:37.898 --> 38:38.899
This drink is good.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.609
-I'm doing this because…
-Oh my god.

38:40.693 --> 38:41.777
I guess your life sucks.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.904
Fuck. What do you know about life?

38:43.988 --> 38:45.364
What about you? Do you know?

38:45.448 --> 38:47.575
-Awesome.
-I don't know. It hits the spot.

38:47.658 --> 38:50.202
Look at me. I'm Ms. O.

38:50.286 --> 38:52.621
"If you don't clean your plate,
it is a sin."

38:52.705 --> 38:54.248
-You're doing it wrong.
-No, I'm not.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.292
-What are you talking about?
-Listen.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.878
-"If you don't clean your plate…"
-I got it.

38:58.961 --> 39:00.463
-Stop.
-What the hell?

39:00.546 --> 39:03.257
Gosh, since Ms. O isn't here
this place is actually decent.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.259
You know, she might die soon.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.595
For real? I hope she just dies!

39:08.804 --> 39:10.514
Hey, girls!

39:10.598 --> 39:11.891
-Die!
-Die!

39:13.893 --> 39:16.687
What about A-reum and A-jin?
They don't have a mom or a dad.

39:16.771 --> 39:17.605
What a pity.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.959
When we visited for the inspection,

39:40.753 --> 39:44.215
someone reported Pureum to the courthouse

39:44.924 --> 39:48.386
for child abuse and illicit use of funds.

39:52.264 --> 39:54.225
Do you know who made the report?

39:57.561 --> 39:58.521
Kim A-reum.

40:01.357 --> 40:02.817
Your daughter.

40:04.193 --> 40:05.236
What…

40:06.821 --> 40:08.739
Why would A-reum do that?

40:09.407 --> 40:10.449
That's…

40:12.243 --> 40:13.869
for you to find out.

40:16.122 --> 40:18.666
She probably knew she shouldn't have,
but did it anyway.

40:21.001 --> 40:22.586
She probably wanted to be noticed.

40:23.712 --> 40:25.005
That she wants you to know…

40:27.091 --> 40:28.384
she's having a hard time.

40:48.612 --> 40:49.572
So…

40:52.074 --> 40:53.909
make sure you're not too late

40:56.996 --> 40:58.414
like Yeong-na's mother.

41:09.008 --> 41:12.011
We're going to get going then.

41:12.553 --> 41:14.972
I'm terribly sorry for everything.

41:15.556 --> 41:19.518
It's okay. You must be tired.
You should get some rest.

41:19.602 --> 41:21.145
Take care.

41:22.521 --> 41:23.814
Take care, A-reum.

41:23.898 --> 41:24.899
Bye.

41:52.259 --> 41:53.594
I'll hold the bag.

41:53.677 --> 41:54.970
It's okay.

41:56.013 --> 41:57.306
Give it.

42:09.902 --> 42:11.028
Why aren't you coming?

42:12.571 --> 42:13.531
I'm coming.

42:16.534 --> 42:17.910
<i>A-reum said</i>

42:18.661 --> 42:20.871
<i>you started the Pureum Home for Girls</i>

42:21.789 --> 42:23.332
<i>after suffering a huge heartbreak.</i>

42:26.710 --> 42:29.630
I can't hear the baby's heartbeat.
One second.

42:50.526 --> 42:52.653
<i>She said you think of every girl at Pureum</i>

42:53.988 --> 42:56.615
<i>as the daughter
you had to let go of that day.</i>

43:02.871 --> 43:05.541
<i>She wants you to stop hurting.</i>

43:07.126 --> 43:08.168
<i>She wants her mom</i>

43:10.212 --> 43:11.589
to be happy.

43:33.402 --> 43:34.862
I'm so embarrassed.

43:36.655 --> 43:41.452
I'm a youth counseling instructor and…

43:44.830 --> 43:46.206
You're not an instructor.

43:52.212 --> 43:53.380
You're a mother

43:55.674 --> 43:57.051
to A-reum.

44:28.040 --> 44:30.501
-Hey, A-reum.
-What?

44:33.045 --> 44:33.879
Wait for me.

44:33.962 --> 44:35.881
What's with you?

44:36.840 --> 44:39.426
What? Are you embarrassed of your own mom?

44:41.553 --> 44:44.014
I'm tired. Give me a piggyback ride.

44:44.098 --> 44:45.974
What, a piggyback ride?

44:46.058 --> 44:47.101
Gosh, you're so heavy.

44:47.184 --> 44:49.228
-Gosh, you can't even carry me?
-Seriously.

44:50.688 --> 44:52.272
I'm just tired.

44:52.356 --> 44:53.357
You're tired?

44:54.108 --> 44:55.692
Gosh, I hate you.

44:55.776 --> 44:57.194
Well, I love you.

45:01.323 --> 45:03.659
I thought about canceling

45:04.410 --> 45:06.662
the appointment of Pureum Home for Girls,

45:07.746 --> 45:09.456
but after thinking about it,

45:11.166 --> 45:12.584
I decided to let it slide.

45:13.669 --> 45:16.338
We found all the girls who ran away.

45:17.005 --> 45:20.801
Strictly speaking, it's hard to say
that court subsidies were used illicitly.

45:21.510 --> 45:25.722
So the head of the center will make
weekly reports and that'll be it.

45:27.182 --> 45:29.393
But the prostitution case

45:30.310 --> 45:32.020
and past group assault cases

45:32.980 --> 45:34.148
can't be overlooked.

45:35.441 --> 45:37.234
Yes, I know.

45:37.943 --> 45:38.944
Yes, sir.

45:39.027 --> 45:40.571
JUVENILE PROTECTION CASE RECORDS

45:40.654 --> 45:41.989
Thank goodness.

45:42.906 --> 45:47.453
I was worried Pureum would get shut down.

45:47.536 --> 45:50.998
Even Presiding Judge Kang
didn't have a choice.

45:52.541 --> 45:55.752
Lacking facilities as is,
they can't afford to shut her down.

45:56.503 --> 46:00.215
The kids and the court
would take the brunt of it.

46:01.800 --> 46:05.512
In other words, it means that the state is

46:07.639 --> 46:10.350
relying solely on individual sacrifices.

46:15.439 --> 46:17.357
In a sense, the court is guilty.

46:20.110 --> 46:21.028
You're right.

46:21.570 --> 46:24.865
So when are the people from
Daejeon District Court coming?

46:25.741 --> 46:28.160
Thank you for coming all the way here.

46:28.243 --> 46:32.456
As I said on the phone,
the reason I asked you to come here

46:32.539 --> 46:36.293
is because of the appointment of
the Pureum Home for Girls.

46:36.376 --> 46:40.339
The court that entrusted the kids
to the Pureum Home for Girls

46:40.422 --> 46:43.967
is Daejeon, where you are,
and here, Yeonhwa.

46:44.051 --> 46:48.472
If judges give different rulings
to similar cases,

46:49.306 --> 46:50.933
it won't be fair.

46:51.016 --> 46:54.520
So we were thinking the trial
should be handled by a single judge,

46:54.603 --> 46:58.732
while we discussed the criteria
of the sentencing together.

46:59.775 --> 47:02.152
Yes, I guess that's one way to do it.

47:02.236 --> 47:06.323
So who will be the judge for the trial?

47:11.328 --> 47:12.955
The sentencing is as follows.

47:13.664 --> 47:15.499
Choi Yeong-na,
maximum two-years at a reformatory.

47:16.375 --> 47:18.210
Ko Hye-rim,
maximum six months at a reformatory.

47:18.293 --> 47:20.337
Yeo Ji-eun,
maximum six months at a reformatory.

47:20.420 --> 47:21.964
Han Min-ju,
maximum six months at a reformatory.

47:22.047 --> 47:23.465
Yun Eun-jeong,
maximum six months at a reformatory.

47:24.925 --> 47:28.136
O Yeon-ji and Woo Min-gyeong, maximum
six months at a protection facility.

47:28.637 --> 47:29.805
But I'm a victim!

47:29.888 --> 47:32.641
Why should I be punished
when I was dragged to that motel?

47:32.724 --> 47:34.977
Joint assault and bodily injury
of Do Yu-gyeong.

47:36.144 --> 47:38.146
Sexual exploitation, blackmailing minors,

47:38.939 --> 47:41.733
and arrangement of prostitution!

47:42.693 --> 47:43.694
Well…

47:45.237 --> 47:46.238
shall I go on?

MOTHER CUT CONTACT AFTER ABANDONING HOME

48:51.678 --> 48:57.601
It's true that juveniles are influenced
by their family and environment.

48:58.101 --> 49:00.937
But in the end, it's themselves
who chose to commit a crime

49:02.189 --> 49:03.523
out of variety of options.

49:05.442 --> 49:08.445
Not everyone resorts to crime
because of their predicament.

49:10.280 --> 49:12.866
So, to all the legal guardians
who are present today,

49:12.949 --> 49:14.910
I order you to receive guardian education.

49:15.535 --> 49:16.411
Especially…

49:18.163 --> 49:19.498
Ms. Choi Yeong-na's legal guardian.

49:20.123 --> 49:21.208
Yes?

49:21.708 --> 49:23.418
You're her uncle, right?

49:24.127 --> 49:25.045
Yes.

49:25.128 --> 49:28.048
Make sure to tell her mother
to attend the course.

49:29.466 --> 49:30.425
Okay.

49:35.514 --> 49:38.767
You will be educated at the facilities
your children will be staying at.

49:38.850 --> 49:42.396
Make sure to attend the course
and visit your children

49:43.730 --> 49:46.108
and see how your children live.

49:49.027 --> 49:51.363
Children do not grow up alone.

49:53.031 --> 49:55.283
Today, the children have been punished,

49:56.660 --> 49:58.161
but the legal guardians must

50:01.248 --> 50:03.667
feel the weight of their crimes as well.

50:22.853 --> 50:23.895
The trial…

50:25.814 --> 50:26.898
is now closed.

50:27.649 --> 50:30.152
Please forgive me. Just this once.

50:30.235 --> 50:31.737
Mom. Dad.

50:31.820 --> 50:33.280
Dad.

50:34.906 --> 50:36.158
Eun-jeong.

50:47.627 --> 50:48.795
Legal guardians, this way.

50:55.302 --> 50:56.470
Ji-eun!

50:58.096 --> 50:59.389
Ji-eun!

51:03.769 --> 51:06.938
-Oh dear. What do I do?
-Gosh.

51:08.106 --> 51:10.066
-Legal guardians, this way.
-Please, one moment.

51:29.753 --> 51:33.256
You know, I'm relieved now that
the Pureum case is over.

51:34.591 --> 51:37.469
Ms. O was at the hospital
and all the girls had disappeared.

51:37.552 --> 51:41.264
Gosh, it felt as if my mind went blank.

51:42.474 --> 51:44.059
Oh, right…

51:45.310 --> 51:47.604
I heard that Ms. O started a new blog.

51:47.687 --> 51:49.397
She's counseling new kids

51:49.481 --> 51:52.400
and made visits to Yeong-na,
Yeon-ji, and Min-gyeong.

51:54.319 --> 51:57.489
I'm going with her this weekend.

51:59.157 --> 52:00.200
You should also…

52:04.079 --> 52:07.040
I'm going to visit the girls
on the weekend.

52:07.123 --> 52:08.583
You should come too.

52:09.334 --> 52:12.003
How are your kids?

52:13.380 --> 52:15.173
Are they doing well in school?

52:16.758 --> 52:18.093
I'm not sure.

52:19.302 --> 52:23.014
At least it seems like they are trying…

52:24.057 --> 52:27.018
You said one of them's in 11th grade
and the other's in 12th grade?

52:27.102 --> 52:28.478
Moongwang High School, was it?

52:30.063 --> 52:30.939
Yes, sir.

52:31.022 --> 52:35.819
A prestigious private high school
with a hundred years of tradition.

52:36.319 --> 52:40.240
So you must know about this case.

Active congressmen, ministers, doctors,
judicial officers, and even celebrities.

52:57.132 --> 52:59.175
A case where test papers were leaked

53:00.260 --> 53:04.097
to a group of students, whose parents'
wealth and honor are in the top 3%.

53:05.974 --> 53:08.393
The prosecution's investigation
will be over soon.

53:08.476 --> 53:13.607
And the only juvenile criminal department
in the district will take the case,

53:13.690 --> 53:15.150
which is yours.

53:16.610 --> 53:20.280
Before that,
are you involved in this case at all?

53:29.164 --> 53:30.957
The name of that group is

53:32.375 --> 53:33.752
Descartes.

53:33.835 --> 53:36.129
They actually did make me an offer,
but I refused.

53:37.047 --> 53:39.257
It shouldn't be a problem

53:39.341 --> 53:41.051
for my team to take the case.

53:41.134 --> 53:42.427
Are you sure?

53:42.510 --> 53:43.678
Yes.

53:47.849 --> 53:48.850
But…

53:52.145 --> 53:52.979
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

53:53.063 --> 53:55.106
I will hand over my work
