WEBVTT

00:14.666 --> 00:16.277
- My name is Wilson Filaw.

00:16.407 --> 00:19.410
I've been an aircraft mechanic
for over 30 years.

00:19.541 --> 00:21.717
I got into bladesmithing 'cause
my son showed an interest,

00:21.847 --> 00:23.936
and it was something
that we could do together.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.982
In this competition,
there's always something

00:26.113 --> 00:28.811
that can go wrong,
but like my son told me,

00:28.941 --> 00:30.639
"We're good at pulling things
out of our butt.

00:30.769 --> 00:32.336
Remember that."

00:32.467 --> 00:35.470
- Jesse Ewing's my name,
34 years old

00:35.600 --> 00:36.862
and I kill bugs for a living.

00:36.993 --> 00:39.300
Pest control, good stuff.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.998
I know that to come
on "Forged in Fire"

00:42.129 --> 00:44.392
is a huge undertaking.

00:44.522 --> 00:47.395
However, I know that I have
the skills and passion

00:47.525 --> 00:49.571
to go all the way.

00:49.701 --> 00:52.052
- My name is Dale Thorson.

00:52.182 --> 00:55.664
What I love about forging
and blade-making is,

00:55.794 --> 00:57.840
you know,
I'm doing the same thing

00:57.970 --> 01:00.843
that my ancestors did
a thousand years ago,

01:00.973 --> 01:03.628
and it's one of the oldest
professions, it is.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.283
- My name's Teddy Royer,

01:06.414 --> 01:09.156
and I'm a welder
for an excavation company.

01:09.286 --> 01:12.463
My wife puts up with a lot
in the garage with a forge,

01:12.594 --> 01:13.769
and not enough roomfor.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.423
She's hoping I win to show

01:15.553 --> 01:16.554
it's not wasted garage space.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.991
It's useful.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.210
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to The Forge.

01:20.341 --> 01:22.386
You're here to engage
in three rounds

01:22.517 --> 01:24.519
of timed edge-making weapon
competition

01:24.649 --> 01:26.173
all in front of a panel
of expert judges

01:26.303 --> 01:28.305
who will tell us which of you

01:28.436 --> 01:30.786
is our next
"Forged in Fire" champion

01:30.916 --> 01:34.877
walking out of here
with $10,000.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.531
Let's go ahead and meet
your judges now.

01:36.661 --> 01:40.578
Up first, ABS Mastersmith,
J. Neilson.

01:40.709 --> 01:43.407
Next, Historic Weapons
Re-creation Specialist,

01:43.538 --> 01:44.713
David Baker.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.367
And last,
Edged-Weapon Specialist,

01:46.497 --> 01:47.933
Doug Marcaida.

01:48.064 --> 01:51.241
In past competitions,
we've had smiths come in here,

01:51.372 --> 01:53.113
and we've asked them
to layer steel

01:53.243 --> 01:56.116
so that they could create
Damascus patterns

01:56.246 --> 01:59.075
like raindrop, ladder,
and shark's tooth.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.338
And today,
we're gonna ask a similar task

02:01.469 --> 02:02.818
of you guys,
except we don't want

02:02.948 --> 02:04.080
just one of these patterns.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.604
We want them all.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.650
How are we gonna get all
of those patterns

02:08.780 --> 02:10.130
into one blade?

02:10.260 --> 02:11.740
Here's how.

02:13.089 --> 02:15.874
With a canister and...

02:22.054 --> 02:24.318
What we have here are
the bits and pieces

02:24.448 --> 02:28.104
of pattern Damascus billets
that are raindrop,

02:28.235 --> 02:30.237
shark's tooth,
and ladder pattern.

02:30.367 --> 02:31.716
And you'll have to take
these bits,

02:31.847 --> 02:33.588
load 'em into the cans,

02:33.718 --> 02:35.285
combine that
with powdered steel

02:35.416 --> 02:38.810
to create
a fossil Damascus billet

02:38.941 --> 02:41.509
from which you will forge
your signature blades

02:41.639 --> 02:42.901
in your signature style.

02:43.032 --> 02:44.468
The length of your blade
must be

02:44.599 --> 02:46.427
between 12 and 14 inches.

02:46.557 --> 02:47.732
The overall length
of this blade

02:47.863 --> 02:49.865
must not exceed 22 inches,

02:49.995 --> 02:52.563
and it must be acid-etched
at the end of this round.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.565
You can choose either
the tall canisters

02:54.696 --> 02:56.393
or the small cubes,
but choose wisely

02:58.787 --> 03:00.049
to ensure you meet
- We gotta combine

03:00.180 --> 03:01.746
all these different patterns
into Damascus,

03:01.877 --> 03:03.487
and I have never done that
before.

03:03.618 --> 03:07.187
Like, holy crap.
This is not a good sign for me.

03:07.317 --> 03:09.014
- If you make it
to the second round,

03:09.145 --> 03:10.581
you'll have an opportunity

03:10.712 --> 03:12.061
to attach a handle
to these blades,

03:12.192 --> 03:13.497
making them fully functional.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.499
And we'll test them
for strength and durability

03:15.630 --> 03:17.632
in a bone chop,
and for edge-retention

03:17.762 --> 03:19.721
in an apple slice.

03:19.851 --> 03:20.983
Good luck, gentlemen.

03:21.113 --> 03:23.246
Your three hours starts now.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.295
All right.

03:28.425 --> 03:29.687
how difficult is
this challenge?

03:29.818 --> 03:32.603
- Honestly, you've got
really good steels

03:32.734 --> 03:33.952
you're working with.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.041
The biggest challenge is
packing everything

03:36.172 --> 03:37.521
into that can.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.436
With all these different size
pieces and shapes,

03:39.567 --> 03:41.308
they've gotta make sure
that they're filling in

03:41.438 --> 03:43.571
all the gaps
with that 1095 powder,

03:43.701 --> 03:46.617
or they're just not gonna get
a good weld.

03:46.748 --> 03:49.403
- The only way I have any clue
on how to do canister Damascus

03:49.533 --> 03:51.709
is from watching a video
that J. Neilson put out.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.016
So I'm gonna try my best
to do what he did.

03:54.146 --> 03:57.149
J. used White Out.
I'm gonna use White Out.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.679
J. inset his top cap
on the canister.

04:04.809 --> 04:06.420
I'm gonna inset my top cap
on the canister.

04:06.550 --> 04:08.335
- Smart work.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.946
Actually makes the canister
a lot more structurally strong.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.557
- I got my canister

04:13.688 --> 04:15.080
in the forge right now.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.604
I need to really let it soak,
get it very, very hot,

04:16.734 --> 04:18.997
hotter than I normally would
on regular Damascus.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.695
That way, I can ensure
that the middle is

04:20.825 --> 04:22.218
actually forged well
in temperature.

04:22.349 --> 04:23.698
Then I'm gonna take it over
to the press,

04:23.828 --> 04:26.570
and I'm gonna squish it
nice and tight.

04:26.701 --> 04:29.181
- I decide to go
with the small cubes.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.314
My thought is,
it's less material per one,

04:31.445 --> 04:32.446
and it'll heat up faster.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.143
And from my experience,

04:34.274 --> 04:36.319
the smaller piece is
actually easier to compact

04:36.450 --> 04:37.364
and make it one solid billet.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.279
- Why would you peel two cans

04:39.409 --> 04:40.497
when you could peel one?

04:40.628 --> 04:42.107
- Make any sense to me.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.805
- So, I have one canister
in the forge right now

04:43.935 --> 04:45.502
heating up while I'm getting
the other one prepped

04:45.633 --> 04:46.764
and put together,
so that way,

04:46.895 --> 04:47.852
we'll hopefully get
a cycle going

04:47.983 --> 04:49.114
so both of them will be good.

04:49.245 --> 04:50.333
Take 'em apart,
forge 'em all together,

04:50.464 --> 04:52.727
should have a knife.

04:54.163 --> 04:55.382
- I grabbed the big canister.

04:55.512 --> 04:56.992
Better to have more than less.

04:58.994 --> 05:01.736
Knowing that I gotta have
a blade that can chop

05:01.866 --> 05:03.215
and a blade that can slice,

05:03.346 --> 05:05.130
I'm going with a bowie knife.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.742
A bowie knife can do it all.

05:07.872 --> 05:09.091
What's more American
than a bowie knife?

05:09.221 --> 05:11.398
That's like apple pie
as far as knives go.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.619
- I am notorious
for working messy.

05:15.750 --> 05:16.925
God, it's a mess.

05:17.055 --> 05:18.883
- Wilson's, like,
smearing White Out

05:19.014 --> 05:20.232
all over everything, man.

05:20.363 --> 05:21.756
It's...

05:21.886 --> 05:23.018
- It's like a Van Gogh painting
over there.

05:23.148 --> 05:25.150
- What are you doing
to our table over there, man?

05:25.281 --> 05:26.848
- I'll clean it up.
- All right.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.416
- We'll worry about it later.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.461
- We've seen that go bad
before.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.158
You get that White Out
on your fingers,

05:33.289 --> 05:35.509
you start touching everything,
you're flipping the can...

05:35.639 --> 05:37.902
suddenly, we've got cold shuts,
delaminations.

05:39.817 --> 05:40.949
- I wanna put as many

05:41.079 --> 05:42.167
of the small pieces
of Damascus

05:42.298 --> 05:43.560
as possible in there.

05:43.691 --> 05:45.214
With this fossil Damascus,

05:45.345 --> 05:46.781
if you can't see the pattern,

05:46.911 --> 05:48.260
you're just wasting your time.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.482
- There is no way
to rush this,

05:52.613 --> 05:55.093
because I gotta make sure
that the inside

05:55.224 --> 05:56.356
is forged well in temperature,

05:56.486 --> 05:58.401
or else I have a completely
worthless billet.

05:58.532 --> 05:59.837
Hot steel.
- All right, here we go.

05:59.968 --> 06:01.317
Here we go.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.710
- So, I take
my super hot canister

06:02.840 --> 06:04.755
over the squaring dies
on the hydraulic press,

06:04.886 --> 06:07.715
and I want to squish it down
a little at a time.

06:07.845 --> 06:11.153
And I'm gonna keep going
until this is solid.

06:11.283 --> 06:13.155
- That's how you do it.
That's how you set your welds.

06:13.285 --> 06:14.983
Get that square can,
you're pushing all four sides

06:15.113 --> 06:18.029
at the same time,
compressing everything evenly.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.337
- Teddy has two small cans
that he's dealing with.

06:21.468 --> 06:24.862
- So I grabbed the first can,
just smash, smash, smash.

06:24.993 --> 06:28.692
The second one, same thing.
I'm excited.

06:28.823 --> 06:29.780
I can tell by the way
it's smashing,

06:29.911 --> 06:31.434
that things feel set.

06:31.565 --> 06:32.609
It's gonna be good.

06:34.219 --> 06:35.351
- I can't wait any longer.

06:35.482 --> 06:38.615
Here goes nothing.
Whoo, that's hot!

06:38.746 --> 06:40.574
I give it a good press
all the way down.

06:40.704 --> 06:42.489
I turn it 90 degrees.

06:42.619 --> 06:43.403
I do another press
all the way down.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.666
I do a pass on the big blue.

06:45.796 --> 06:48.190
That rod is hot as a $2 pistol.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.888
Normally, at home,
I do at least two passes

06:51.019 --> 06:52.760
on the squaring dies,

06:52.890 --> 06:55.110
but I go with my gut
that it's a good weld.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.373
Oh, that can's hot!

06:57.504 --> 06:59.157
- I cannot believe
that those welds

06:59.288 --> 07:01.464
are consolidated in
that billet he's got

07:01.595 --> 07:03.553
after one run on the press.

07:03.684 --> 07:07.644
- One pass is pretty ballsy
for a competition.

07:08.993 --> 07:11.561
- Looks good.
I'm tickled to death.

07:11.692 --> 07:13.911
It looks like
it's gonna peel good.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.826
- All right, so Wilson's locked
into a vice

07:15.957 --> 07:18.046
with a little bit colder
piece of steel

07:18.176 --> 07:20.527
than Dale is locking
into a vice.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.833
- I set the weld
on my canister,

07:22.964 --> 07:25.967
and my edges are bulging,
my sides are bulging.

07:26.097 --> 07:27.925
So I start cutting a can off.

07:28.056 --> 07:31.755
- Bladesmiths!
60 minutes has elapsed.

07:31.886 --> 07:34.018
You have two hours remaining
to finish your work.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.548
Wilson just pulled his billet
out of the can.

07:41.678 --> 07:42.853
- There you go.

07:42.984 --> 07:43.985
I've got
a nice-looking billet.

07:44.115 --> 07:45.552
I couldn't be more excited.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.205
I'm on schedule,

07:47.336 --> 07:50.731
and I'm set up
for a good knife.

07:50.861 --> 07:52.559
- All right, Dale,
it looks like you're getting

07:52.689 --> 07:54.256
some movement on the can there.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.779
- The White Out is a savior.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.478
If you don't use White Out,
you're gonna be fighting

07:58.608 --> 08:00.523
to get that canister off.

08:00.654 --> 08:01.872
- Dale's got
a pretty good-looking

08:02.003 --> 08:02.917
billet of steel right there.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.571
- There we go.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.662
- I know
from watching J.'s video

08:08.792 --> 08:10.446
that if you do this right,
your canister comes off

08:10.577 --> 08:12.100
in one, maybe two pieces.

08:12.230 --> 08:14.189
- There you go!

08:14.319 --> 08:16.104
There you go!
- Yes!

08:18.106 --> 08:20.108
- Swing and a miss.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.372
- I got it off in two pieces,
J.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.635
The billet looks solid,

08:25.766 --> 08:28.333
and I've gotta turn this thing
into a blade.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.901
- We got Teddy still working
on peeling the cans.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.251
- It's very frustrating,
'cause I can see

08:33.382 --> 08:34.905
the billet in there loose,

08:35.036 --> 08:37.386
but it doesn't pop out
the way I want it to.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.736
I'm kinda getting stressed out
a little bit.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.782
All three other smiths are
onto the forging part

08:41.912 --> 08:43.392
of their blades at this time.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.873
I may have chosen
the wrong process on this.

08:46.003 --> 08:47.178
Come on.

08:47.309 --> 08:48.397
I still have to weld

08:48.528 --> 08:49.659
these two together.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.269
- If you need to make
a bigger can,

08:51.400 --> 08:52.749
why didn't you just start
with a big can?

08:52.880 --> 08:54.316
- Exactly.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.361
- I am excited.

08:56.492 --> 08:59.582
I have this beautiful
bar of steel.

08:59.713 --> 09:00.844
I'm working it in big blue.

09:00.975 --> 09:03.499
Oh, my God.

09:03.630 --> 09:04.718
- Don't look like
it's falling apart.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.502
He's looking at something,
though.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.591
- You think it's about
to fall part, Dave?

09:08.722 --> 09:11.942
- He's looking at something.
He's got a problem.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.727
- Oh, Lord, help me.

09:13.857 --> 09:16.077
There's cracks laying across
the blade,

09:16.207 --> 09:18.470
and I do not know why.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.647
That looks like hammered
dog poo.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.692
- Wilson right there,
his billet,

09:22.823 --> 09:24.172
I saw the cracks.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.434
He's got some issues
going on over there.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.219
- I am freaking out.

09:28.350 --> 09:30.570
There's not enough time
to make a new canister.

09:30.700 --> 09:31.962
I am screwed.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.533
- I'm already behind.
I have what I have.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.056
I don't have time to start
another one.

09:39.187 --> 09:41.537
I have to get these things off.
This is intense.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.977
- We got Teddy still working on
peeling the cans.

09:47.108 --> 09:48.239
- Come on.

09:48.370 --> 09:49.589
I still have to weld

09:49.719 --> 09:50.938
these two together.

09:51.068 --> 09:53.070
There it is.
There it is.

09:53.201 --> 09:56.117
So I stack 'em up,
grab it, run over to the press,

09:56.247 --> 09:58.380
and three or four presses,

09:58.510 --> 10:00.512
and it looks like
I have a solid billet.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.559
- That's not good.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.300
- Wilson's still got problems
up in that blade

10:05.430 --> 10:07.215
from that initial weld.

10:07.345 --> 10:10.392
- So if Wilson's billet
does have some cracks in it,

10:10.522 --> 10:13.090
is it best to chop 'em up
and try to forge weld 'em

10:13.221 --> 10:14.788
all over again?

10:14.918 --> 10:16.137
- I'd try to grind 'em out.
Just get rid of 'em.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.269
Make 'em disappear.
Then he can stretch it out.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.881
- I know that
I can't grind it out.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.100
It's on both sides,
and it goes up too far.

10:23.231 --> 10:25.886
I will not have anything left
to make a blade with.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.018
To me, my only option is
to try to weld it.

10:30.542 --> 10:31.718
- We got Wilson over here
welding,

10:31.848 --> 10:34.982
and welding is a bad thing,
at this point.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.374
- Yeah, it's not a good sign.

10:36.505 --> 10:39.290
- You never think
it's gonna be you.

10:46.776 --> 10:47.864
- There it is.

10:47.995 --> 10:48.909
All of a sudden,
there's a knife shape.

10:49.039 --> 10:50.258
- Yep.

10:50.388 --> 10:51.346
- It's one
of those fascinating things

10:51.476 --> 10:52.608
when you're making a knife.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.566
That two, three,
maybe four hammer blows

10:54.697 --> 10:56.394
can go from a billet
to a blade.

10:59.006 --> 10:59.789
- Teddy's shape is
coming along.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.225
He's got, like, almost

11:01.356 --> 11:03.488
a machete-esque shape
right now.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.969
- Very lean too,
so it'll be a good cutter.

11:08.363 --> 11:09.190
- I'm actually
really comfortable

11:09.320 --> 11:10.408
where I'm at right now.

11:10.539 --> 11:11.453
I got it forged, mostly,
to shape.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.150
I even have my bevels
forged in.

11:13.281 --> 11:15.022
It's a matter of drill
a pinhole, get it straight.

11:15.152 --> 11:16.850
I'm gonna quench it,
clean her up on the grinder,

11:16.980 --> 11:19.983
and make her look pretty.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.292
- Hey, Jesse's got
a cool-looking blade.

11:24.422 --> 11:25.249
- Yeah, I like it.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.296
And we got a quenched blade.

11:28.426 --> 11:30.298
- He was the second to the last
of our smiths

11:30.428 --> 11:32.082
to have his blades
out of the canister.

11:33.562 --> 11:34.781
- I don't even look
at my blade.

11:34.911 --> 11:35.738
I don't even know
if there's a warp.

11:35.869 --> 11:36.870
I'm just not chancing it,

11:37.000 --> 11:37.827
so it's going in this vice.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.356
- Teddy quenched.

11:45.487 --> 11:47.532
- I noticed that
there's a slight bow

11:47.663 --> 11:48.969
in my blade.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.361
I figure I can fix that
in the grinder.

11:50.492 --> 11:51.493
Because it is so thin,

11:51.623 --> 11:53.321
I'm worried about taking
too much off.

11:53.451 --> 11:55.758
But I believe
unless I screwed up

11:55.889 --> 11:57.412
that it meets
length parameters.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.457
It's gonna be hardened,
and it's gonna be acid-edged.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.199
- We have three quenched blades
out there

12:02.330 --> 12:03.200
on The Forge floor.

12:03.331 --> 12:04.854
Dale has yet to quench.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.464
- Ah, sweet girl.

12:06.595 --> 12:07.639
- Hopefully, he gets a move on.

12:09.293 --> 12:12.601
- My blade is straight
and hard.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.821
I can live with that.

12:14.951 --> 12:17.649
- You only have
ten minutes left, bladesmiths!

12:17.780 --> 12:19.477
- I was hoping I'd get
a ten-minute etch

12:19.608 --> 12:21.044
from these guys.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.393
- And J., I was hoping
for a pony when I was five.

12:22.524 --> 12:24.134
I didn't get that either.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.790
- Yay.
Finally.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.707
- Man, Dale did a great job,
I think.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.143
That blade looks good.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.797
- I'm racing against the clock
here.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.886
I gotta clean this thing up
and etch it.

12:37.017 --> 12:39.410
- Ten, nine, eight,

12:39.541 --> 12:43.240
seven, six, five, four,

12:43.371 --> 12:46.330
three, two, one.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.115
Bladesmiths,
shut down your machines.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.377
Drop your tools.

12:49.507 --> 12:52.162
This first round
of competition is over.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.035
- Whoo!
- Man!

12:55.165 --> 12:56.471
- Whoo.

12:56.601 --> 12:57.777
- I'm not happy
with the blade.

12:57.907 --> 13:01.563
Has a beautiful pattern
in between the cracks,

13:01.693 --> 13:06.002
but I did what I could,
the best I could.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.438
And now, if there's
another way of doing it,

13:07.569 --> 13:09.919
my God, I don't know it.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.616
- Bladesmiths,
that was a tough first round

13:11.747 --> 13:12.748
of competition.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.358
We asked each of you guys
to make

13:14.489 --> 13:16.970
a fossil canister Damascus
blade

13:17.100 --> 13:19.929
using bits and pieces
of other Damascus billets.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.018
Now, your blades had to
have been

13:22.149 --> 13:23.759
between 12 and 14 inches
in length

13:23.890 --> 13:26.370
with an overall length
not to exceed 22 inches.

13:26.501 --> 13:29.417
The parameters exist
so that we have

13:29.547 --> 13:32.768
an absolute minimum standard
for the judges to go off.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.422
- And gentlemen,

13:34.552 --> 13:38.556
one of your blades has not hit
that parameter.

13:38.687 --> 13:42.604
- Teddy, Jesse,
come and get your blades.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.649
You made parameters.

13:47.217 --> 13:51.656
Wilson, your blade is
absolutely hammered to death.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.528
However, you met parameters.

13:53.658 --> 13:55.965
Come and collect your steel.

13:56.096 --> 13:59.316
Dale, you have
an absolutely beautiful here.

13:59.447 --> 14:02.058
The steel is beautiful,
but you missed the parameter

14:02.189 --> 14:03.581
by over half an inch.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.498
- Your blade is 11 3/8 inches
in length,

14:07.629 --> 14:11.285
that's 5/8 under our minimum
blade length of 12 inches.

14:11.415 --> 14:14.244
You really did fantastic work
out there,

14:14.375 --> 14:16.943
but unfortunately,
I have to ask you

14:17.073 --> 14:17.987
to please leave The Forge.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.296
- I came here to prove
that I can make a blade

14:22.426 --> 14:25.255
that stands up with
my colleagues, and I did that.

14:25.386 --> 14:28.128
I'm happy
with what I prod.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.433
I had a great time
in the competition.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.000
I made three new friends

14:31.131 --> 14:33.307
and an experience
that I'll never forget.

14:33.437 --> 14:34.786
Given the chance,
I'd do this all again.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.270
- Bladesmiths, congratulations.

14:40.401 --> 14:41.358
You've made it
into the second round

14:41.489 --> 14:43.186
of this competition,

14:43.317 --> 14:44.622
which means that your work is
far from over, Wilson.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.494
- Ah.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.148
- And now that your blades
have been tempered,

14:48.278 --> 14:50.759
it's time to turn those blades
into fully functional weapons

14:50.890 --> 14:52.021
by attaching handles to them.

14:52.152 --> 14:53.588
You must use at least

14:53.718 --> 14:55.546
three different materials
in your handle

14:55.677 --> 14:56.808
from the pantry,

14:56.939 --> 14:58.723
and they must be
fixed securely

14:58.854 --> 15:00.073
at the end of this round.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.770
You will have two hours

15:01.901 --> 15:03.032
in which to complete your work.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.773
After this round,
your blades will be tested

15:04.904 --> 15:07.515
for strength and durability
in a bone chop.

15:07.645 --> 15:09.517
And they'll also be tested
for edge-retention

15:09.647 --> 15:11.867
in an apple slice.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.608
Good luck, smiths.
You know what to do.

15:13.738 --> 15:16.263
Your two hours starts now.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.572
- Gosh, come on.
Give me something good-looking.

15:21.703 --> 15:22.834
- These guys have to do

15:22.965 --> 15:24.532
multi-piece construction
handles.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.577
Luckily, they all have
full tang blades.

15:26.708 --> 15:29.363
They can just take liners,
pins, and handle material,

15:29.493 --> 15:31.017
slap it all together,
and that's three.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.193
- Nope.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.368
- Yeah,
or they can just take a liner

15:34.498 --> 15:35.760
and take a couple
different sets of scales

15:35.891 --> 15:37.110
and put them together.

15:38.850 --> 15:41.897
- I want solid, easy materials
to work with

15:42.028 --> 15:44.378
that are similar in size
and almost bullet proof.

15:44.508 --> 15:47.381
Micarta, slash G-10,
and then I also have

15:47.511 --> 15:49.165
brass liner
to put in there for my third

15:49.296 --> 15:50.340
separate handle material.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.215
- Jesse's just pulled out
the portaband.

15:55.345 --> 15:56.956
He's cutting up
some handle material.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.308
- Oh, my...

16:01.438 --> 16:02.700
First thing I'm gonna do is

16:02.831 --> 16:05.616
try to make Frankenstein
hold together.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.923
- Wilson's the challenge
in this one.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.403
- Oh, yeah.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.144
- Wilson's got a lot of flaws
in that blade,

16:11.274 --> 16:13.450
especially down on the spine.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.539
- My blade has more cracks
than a plumbers convention.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.109
As I'm grinding,

16:20.240 --> 16:22.938
I try to do the best
veeing out on the cracks.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.244
If you don't vee it out,

16:24.374 --> 16:26.028
all you're doing is
a surface weld.

16:26.159 --> 16:27.943
- Wilson's identified
those cracks,

16:28.074 --> 16:29.771
and he's just gonna fill 'em in
with welds.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.120
- We've had smiths
do that before,

16:31.251 --> 16:32.165
and it's succeeded.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.731
- Right.
- Welding.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.866
- Teddy's got a really
good-looking blade.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.781
Not too sure about
his tang shape.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.957
- That's a big issue
with Teddy right now.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.351
He's got
a very narrow tang profile.

16:44.481 --> 16:46.788
- I'm definitely concerned
with the size of my tang,

16:46.918 --> 16:48.355
but it's what I have
to work with.

16:48.485 --> 16:50.835
So I'm just trying to focus
on making it

16:50.966 --> 16:52.054
as shock resistant as possible

16:52.185 --> 16:53.055
We have a bone chop coming up.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.361
- It looks like Teddy's gonna

16:54.491 --> 16:55.362
blue back his tang.

16:55.492 --> 16:56.798
- Smart move.

16:56.928 --> 16:58.408
Well, that's gonna soften
the steel.

16:58.539 --> 16:59.801
- It's not a bad idea,
especially that we're gonna be

16:59.931 --> 17:00.976
chopping on bone.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.895
- I'm going short bursts
with the MIG welder,

17:07.026 --> 17:10.290
because I'm not wanting
to burn through my piece.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.553
I put a lot of weld
on Frankenstein.

17:12.683 --> 17:16.861
All I can do is just hope
I have all my cracks welded.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.341
There's still no guarantee.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.954
One more spot.
Shoot me.

17:24.608 --> 17:25.696
- I don't have time
to play around

17:25.827 --> 17:27.002
and go slow.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.047
I need to get this handle
put together.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.094
- Oh!
- Whoa.

17:32.225 --> 17:34.401
That pin just blew out
the other side of my handle.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.142
- That ain't Micarta.

17:38.579 --> 17:40.624
I want to find Micarta.

17:40.755 --> 17:41.756
That is gonna be
the safest bet for me.

17:43.236 --> 17:44.889
Other materials crack
and break.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.935
I don't have time for this,
and now I'm freaking out.

17:47.066 --> 17:51.635
Short.
Cracked.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.289
Finally,
I find what I'm looking for.

17:53.420 --> 17:56.118
- One hour has elapsed.

17:56.249 --> 17:59.861
You have 60 rapidly depleting
minutes to finish your work.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.254
- Yes, sir.

18:01.384 --> 18:04.083
- Teddy's also constructed
his handle.

18:04.213 --> 18:06.476
- Yeah, he's got padauk
and some linen Micarta.

18:06.607 --> 18:09.218
- What's the third?
- G-10, liner.

18:09.349 --> 18:10.524
That's gonna be interesting.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.526
- I do want bolsters
on this blade

18:12.656 --> 18:14.745
to bring some weight
back into the handle,

18:14.876 --> 18:16.791
'cause right now
it's incredibly tip heavy.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.275
While the blade's taking
an acid bath,

18:22.405 --> 18:24.190
I've gotta get
the handle materials ready.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.670
Let's see what I have
left over.

18:26.801 --> 18:27.889
- Wilson's fighting hard,

18:28.019 --> 18:29.151
but he's done a lot
of smart things.

18:29.282 --> 18:30.979
You know,
welding up those seams,

18:31.110 --> 18:32.372
cleaning up that blade.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.811
- So I can't get fancy
with the handle.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.552
I just want it to feel good

18:38.682 --> 18:40.902
where it doesn't hurt
anybody's hand.

18:41.032 --> 18:42.730
I need to keep it simple.

18:42.860 --> 18:45.472
On one side, I'm gonna have
my composite material

18:45.602 --> 18:47.343
and the brass liner.

18:47.474 --> 18:48.605
And the on the other side,
I'm gonna have my rosewood.

18:48.736 --> 18:49.954
We gotta move.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.609
I guarantee I shape this
handle

18:52.740 --> 18:55.046
faster than any handle
I've ever made.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.744
I'm gonna have
a finished blade.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.963
It might pop just looking
at the bone,

18:59.094 --> 19:01.096
but by God,
I'll have a finished blade.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.925
- I was able to get
my handle together

19:04.055 --> 19:05.231
on my knife.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.015
Now is the time
for me to shine.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.583
I want this thing
extremely strong and sharp.

19:09.713 --> 19:13.108
If my knife somehow holds up
to the bone bashing,

19:13.239 --> 19:15.328
it needs to be sharp enough
to cut these apples.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.459
- 15 minutes!

19:18.635 --> 19:20.159
- At this point in time,

19:20.289 --> 19:22.726
I am nowhere near
where I wanna be on the handle.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.424
Seeing how small my handle is,

19:24.554 --> 19:26.426
the paracord will help
beef up the handle,

19:26.556 --> 19:27.775
make it taller,

19:27.905 --> 19:29.298
make it index properly
in in the hand.

19:29.429 --> 19:31.300
- I like the idea
of building the handle up

19:31.431 --> 19:33.520
with the paracord.

19:33.650 --> 19:37.176
- I have fought tooth
and nail to get to this point,

19:37.306 --> 19:39.003
and I'm starting to take
a little bit of pride

19:39.134 --> 19:40.222
in the blade.

19:40.353 --> 19:41.745
Oh, hallelujah.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.878
- Wilson's edge looked cool
on his blade.

19:44.008 --> 19:48.535
It's like he's got his mosaic
pattern in little boxes.

19:48.665 --> 19:51.320
- Frankenstein knife.

19:51.451 --> 19:54.236
It's alive!
It's alive!

19:56.151 --> 19:58.762
Okay, let's--got two minutes
and 30 seconds left.

19:58.893 --> 20:01.591
Let's--let's fumble
with the grinder.

20:01.722 --> 20:03.985
- Wilson's a fighter, man.
He is not giving up.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.160
- He's in high gear.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.509
- Come on, Wilson.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.860
- I'm trying to give it
more of a convex

20:09.991 --> 20:12.602
pyramid edge to survive better
with the bone,

20:12.733 --> 20:14.517
'cause I need all the help
I can get.

20:14.648 --> 20:15.953
- One minute!

20:16.084 --> 20:17.651
- To do that,
you're taking away

20:17.781 --> 20:21.263
from the cutting principles,
like slicing apples.

20:21.394 --> 20:24.005
So there's got to be
a happy medium there.

20:24.135 --> 20:26.616
- Five, four, three,

20:26.747 --> 20:29.271
two, one.

20:29.402 --> 20:30.490
Bladesmiths,
stop what you're doing.

20:30.620 --> 20:31.926
Drop your tools.
This second round

20:32.056 --> 20:33.971
of competition is over.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.629
- I'm done.
I did it.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.719
My son told me
pull it out my butt,

20:42.850 --> 20:45.374
and maybe I pulled one out.

20:45.505 --> 20:48.334
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the strength test.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.336
I know you've been
looking forward to this.

20:50.466 --> 20:51.989
We got the bone chop here.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.470
And I'm gonna take
each of your blades,

20:54.601 --> 20:56.255
and I'm gonna
baton them through

20:56.385 --> 20:59.040
these very large,
very dense bones.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.564
And what your blades do
to the bones,

21:01.695 --> 21:02.913
I'm not too concerned about.

21:03.044 --> 21:05.481
I wanna see what the bones
do to your blades.

21:05.612 --> 21:06.830
Teddy, you ready to
rock and roll?

21:06.961 --> 21:08.571
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

21:08.702 --> 21:11.487
- My biggest concern
coming into this test is,

21:11.618 --> 21:13.272
my knife is long and thin.

21:13.402 --> 21:15.491
It can break pretty easily,

21:15.622 --> 21:17.798
and no sane person would be
smacking it

21:17.928 --> 21:20.279
against the bone like this.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.040
Good job, Teddy.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.781
Your edge is fine.

21:44.912 --> 21:48.219
I mean, there's a couple
tiny, little glints

21:48.350 --> 21:51.353
I can see on the edge,
but overall, good job.

21:51.484 --> 21:53.312
- Thank you.
- How you feeling, Jesse?

21:53.442 --> 21:55.096
- I'm ready.
- Good, so am I.

21:55.226 --> 21:56.880
- Go nuts.
- I'm halfway there already.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.930
- "Go nuts," probably not
a smart thing to say to him.

22:03.060 --> 22:06.586
However, here we are.
It's gut-wrenching.

22:06.716 --> 22:09.110
I'm nervous something is
gonna break or fly

22:09.240 --> 22:11.373
and go crazy off my blade.

22:24.473 --> 22:25.605
- Oh, my gosh.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.315
- Nice job, Jesse.
- Thank you.

22:40.446 --> 22:43.144
- You did lose a little bit
of your fine edge,

22:43.274 --> 22:45.973
but overall,
knife's fairly comfortable.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.627
You survived.
Good job.

22:47.757 --> 22:50.020
- Thank you.
- How you feeling, Wilson?

22:50.151 --> 22:52.849
- I'm ready for you to do
whatever J. does.

22:52.980 --> 22:56.679
- This is what I do.
- Then do it to it.

22:58.072 --> 22:59.682
I'm apprehensive
that the blade

22:59.813 --> 23:01.945
might have a crack
that I don't know of.

23:02.076 --> 23:04.208
I'm just praying
that it'll make it

23:04.339 --> 23:06.254
through the test in one piece.

23:28.494 --> 23:29.669
- Yes.
- Unbelievable.

23:35.457 --> 23:38.068
- Good job, Wilson,
made it through.

23:38.199 --> 23:39.592
- I made it through.

23:39.722 --> 23:41.768
- The only thing I see,
there's not much edge

23:41.898 --> 23:43.204
pretty much from here up.

23:43.334 --> 23:44.248
- Okay.

23:44.379 --> 23:46.555
- But striking the bone,

23:46.686 --> 23:49.297
didn't roll anything,
didn't chip it out.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.342
Good job.
- Thank you.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.866
- Dave.

23:54.955 --> 23:56.217
- All right, gentlemen,

23:56.347 --> 23:57.566
you've survived
our strength test.

23:57.697 --> 23:58.741
Now it's onto
the sharpness test,

23:58.872 --> 24:00.221
the apple slice.

24:00.351 --> 24:02.049
Now unlike the strength test,
this is all about

24:02.179 --> 24:03.877
what your blades do
to those apples.

24:04.007 --> 24:06.270
Looking for a good, clean cut.

24:06.401 --> 24:07.533
Teddy, you're up first.
Are you ready?

24:07.663 --> 24:09.056
- Let's do it.
- All right.

24:24.898 --> 24:28.205
Man.
- Oh, my gosh.

24:28.336 --> 24:30.991
- So Teddy, your knife is
definitely sharp,

24:31.121 --> 24:33.994
but if you look at the tip,
it's kinda got a warp this way.

24:34.124 --> 24:36.170
It's flat on one side,
and it's ground on the other.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.780
When I hit those apples,

24:37.911 --> 24:38.738
you can actually see it
in the apples.

24:38.868 --> 24:39.869
It just goes...

24:41.349 --> 24:42.568
And rides right up
and out of 'em.

24:42.698 --> 24:44.047
It affects the cut,
but it doesn't affect

24:44.178 --> 24:45.701
the fact that this is still
a sharp blade.

24:45.832 --> 24:48.095
Well done.
- Thank you, thank you.

24:48.225 --> 24:49.488
- All right, Jesse.
You're up next.

24:49.618 --> 24:50.663
You ready for this?
- Yes, sir.

24:50.793 --> 24:52.403
- Okay.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.242
Man.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.116
All right, Jesse.

25:09.246 --> 25:11.031
There's some damage
to this edge,

25:11.161 --> 25:12.946
and it's a really obtuse edge.

25:13.076 --> 25:15.209
You can see that the slice
kind of goes

25:15.339 --> 25:16.427
halfway through that apple,

25:16.558 --> 25:17.907
then it cracks it off
after that

25:18.038 --> 25:19.866
just 'cause the blade gets
so wide.

25:19.996 --> 25:22.564
Not the sharpest thing
on the planet, but it'll do it.

25:22.695 --> 25:24.305
Good job.
- Thank you.

25:24.435 --> 25:26.089
- All right, Wilson.
You're up.

25:26.220 --> 25:29.005
- Cut it.
- Okay.

25:43.454 --> 25:44.978
So yeah, it is sharp,

25:45.108 --> 25:46.893
but it's just
wedging them apart.

25:47.023 --> 25:48.677
And yeah, I could probably
chop wood with this,

25:48.808 --> 25:50.331
but for slicing apples,

25:50.461 --> 25:52.333
it's just got the wrong
edge geometry.

25:52.463 --> 25:54.030
- I understand.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.817
- Bladesmiths, the judges'
deliberation is complete.

25:57.947 --> 25:59.732
They've made
their final decision.

25:59.862 --> 26:03.213
It's time for one of you smiths
to leave The Forge.

26:03.344 --> 26:05.041
The bladesmith leaving
The Forge is...

26:09.306 --> 26:10.307
Wilson.

26:10.438 --> 26:11.570
Your blade didn't make the cut,

26:11.700 --> 26:13.180
and David Baker's gonna
tell you why.

26:13.310 --> 26:15.399
- Wilson, your blade's heavy.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.053
It has an obtuse edge,

26:17.184 --> 26:19.055
and it was really designed
only for one of our tests.

26:19.186 --> 26:20.535
But before we let you go,

26:20.666 --> 26:24.104
I wanna tell you that rarely
have we seen a smith

26:24.234 --> 26:25.714
work so hard to get around

26:25.845 --> 26:28.195
what looked like
insurmountable problems.

26:28.325 --> 26:29.892
You pushed to the very end,

26:30.023 --> 26:31.328
made it through
that strength test,

26:31.459 --> 26:33.156
and I'm just really proud
of what you did.

26:33.287 --> 26:35.071
- Thank you.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.030
- Wilson,
please surrender your blade.

26:39.380 --> 26:42.383
- This has been
an excellent experience.

26:42.513 --> 26:44.603
It's showed me that I have
the drive

26:44.733 --> 26:46.213
to keep going and going,

26:46.343 --> 26:49.172
even when things
are not turning out right

26:49.303 --> 26:51.566
and are not gonna
turn out right.

26:51.697 --> 26:52.915
But you have to do
the best you can

26:53.046 --> 26:54.177
and keep going at it.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.880
- Jesse, Teddy,
congratulations.

27:01.010 --> 27:02.446
You boys have made it
to the final round

27:02.577 --> 27:03.534
of this competition.

27:03.665 --> 27:04.666
Now, when you showed up here,

27:04.797 --> 27:06.450
we had you make
fossil Damascus.

27:06.581 --> 27:08.409
Now, we're sending you back
to your home forges

27:08.539 --> 27:09.671
to recreate something

27:09.802 --> 27:11.760
with a little bit more
recent history.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.936
This.

27:16.156 --> 27:17.897
This is a musketeer's rapier.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.379
- Oh, dear.

27:22.510 --> 27:24.555
- Originating
in the early 1600s,

27:24.686 --> 27:26.079
the musketeer's rapier was

27:26.209 --> 27:27.733
the distinctive weapon
of the colorful

27:27.863 --> 27:29.996
French Musketeers
of the Guard.

27:30.126 --> 27:32.128
These elite troops were
the first line of defense

27:32.259 --> 27:33.652
for French royalty.

27:33.782 --> 27:35.218
Featuring a thin,
diamond profile blade

27:35.349 --> 27:36.785
that tapers down to a point,

27:36.916 --> 27:38.352
it's extreme light weight
made it excellent

27:38.482 --> 27:41.181
for quick slashing cuts
and pinpoint stabs.

27:41.311 --> 27:43.923
In addition, the weapon's
double clamshell guard

27:44.053 --> 27:46.490
aided in defense
by protecting the user's hand,

27:46.621 --> 27:49.058
especially during
one-on-one duels.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.104
Tales of
the swashbuckling musketeers

27:51.234 --> 27:52.714
are world-famous to this day

27:52.845 --> 27:55.978
and can be seen in the film
"The Three Musketeers."

27:56.109 --> 27:58.328
Gentlemen, your final challenge
is to forge

27:58.459 --> 27:59.721
a musketeer's rapier.

27:59.852 --> 28:01.897
It must be an effective
and working version

28:02.028 --> 28:03.377
of the weapon
that you see here.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.422
Your parameters are as follows.

28:05.553 --> 28:06.815
The length of the blade
must be

28:06.946 --> 28:08.817
between 37 and 39 inches
in length.

28:08.948 --> 28:10.340
The fullers must run

28:10.471 --> 28:12.908
between 1/3 and 1/2
the length of the blade.

28:13.039 --> 28:15.868
On each side, you must have
a clamshell guard,

28:15.998 --> 28:19.436
two side bars,
a rear and front quillion,

28:19.567 --> 28:21.134
a knuckle-bow and pommel.

28:22.526 --> 28:23.919
- I told my wife
before I left,

28:24.050 --> 28:26.095
the one weapon I did not
wanna build was a rapier.

28:27.967 --> 28:30.491
Yeah.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.754
- You'll have just four days
to create this

28:32.885 --> 28:33.973
at your home forges.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.365
At the end of those four days,

28:35.496 --> 28:36.453
you'll return
and present your swords

28:36.584 --> 28:38.194
to our panel of expert judges.

28:38.325 --> 28:39.979
And after they've thoroughly
tested them,

28:40.109 --> 28:41.458
one of you will be
the "Forged in Fire" champion,

28:41.589 --> 28:43.417
leaving here with a check
for ten grand.

28:43.547 --> 28:45.288
Good luck, gentlemen.
We'll see you in four days.

28:45.419 --> 28:47.421
- Sounds good.
- I'm speechless.

28:47.551 --> 28:49.510
Good luck.
Holy crap.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.385
- It's day one,
and I get to build

28:55.516 --> 28:56.517
the musketeer rapier.

28:56.647 --> 28:59.650
So I'm using 5160.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.348
It's tough, it's springy.

29:01.478 --> 29:02.741
And rapiers,
since they're so thin,

29:02.871 --> 29:04.394
they are meant to flex
a little bit.

29:04.525 --> 29:05.395
So that's what
we're going with.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.181
So today, my game plan is

29:08.311 --> 29:10.183
to hopefully get the blade
rucked out.

29:10.313 --> 29:12.533
That will allow me to spend
a lot of time

29:12.663 --> 29:14.535
working on the guard,
making it elaborate.

29:14.665 --> 29:16.580
But right now, I'm really glad
I have long arms.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.365
So I'd love to give the judges
something that they wanna

29:18.495 --> 29:19.888
stare at just as much
as they wanna use.

29:22.282 --> 29:23.718
I've got
the entire blade shaped.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.111
It's beveled.

29:25.241 --> 29:26.242
I'm satisfied
with where I'm at.

29:29.506 --> 29:33.293
- Day one, and I'm taking on
the musketeer rapier.

29:33.423 --> 29:37.645
I'm gonna go with bar stock
size of 80CRV2.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.953
Super strong, should hold up
very well to the testing.

29:41.083 --> 29:42.345
That's gonna be
the hardest part,

29:42.476 --> 29:43.520
'cause I don't know
what has to survive.

29:43.651 --> 29:45.261
Hey!

29:45.392 --> 29:47.568
I'm about 40 1/2 inches
total length,

29:47.698 --> 29:49.483
which gives me plenty of room
for error.

29:49.613 --> 29:51.093
Think I'm gonna start
working on the fuller.

29:58.144 --> 30:00.450
I can't complain about that.
My first-ever fuller.

30:00.581 --> 30:03.105
With all the factors involved
in this quench,

30:03.236 --> 30:06.717
the low roof of the garage,
the tall quench tank,

30:06.848 --> 30:09.764
a ladder
just to reach above it...

30:09.895 --> 30:12.201
I'm hoping that I can get it
right the first time.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.467
- Ah, damn it!

30:17.598 --> 30:19.818
Catastrophically, the sword
drops out of my hands.

30:19.948 --> 30:22.821
I see this huge bow.

30:22.951 --> 30:25.562
I gotta get this thing
in my straightening jig.

30:25.693 --> 30:27.173
I have no idea
what's gonna come out.

30:27.303 --> 30:28.914
I'm really scared.
I'm really nervous.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.045
Holy crap.

30:30.176 --> 30:31.481
I'm thinking I'm gonna have to

30:31.612 --> 30:33.092
do this a second time.

30:34.963 --> 30:36.835
So the sword's cooled off
in the straightening jig.

30:36.965 --> 30:39.968
Let's see if I just performed
a miracle here.

30:40.099 --> 30:41.404
It's time to open it up
and see what's inside.

30:43.058 --> 30:45.060
Holy crap.

30:45.191 --> 30:47.541
There's slight warpage
on there,

30:47.671 --> 30:49.282
but nothing crazy that
I can't fix with a grinder.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.545
She's hard.

30:51.675 --> 30:55.505
I've never made a sword before,
so I'm ecstatic right now.

30:57.203 --> 30:58.900
- The plan for today is,

30:59.031 --> 31:01.468
I gotta get the blade
rough ground

31:01.598 --> 31:03.122
and heat-treated.

31:03.252 --> 31:05.167
This thing is
so freaking long.

31:05.298 --> 31:06.603
And then it'll be onto

31:06.734 --> 31:08.040
all the fittings
and furnishings.

31:13.175 --> 31:15.525
It's not biting,
it's not skinning quite right.

31:15.656 --> 31:17.440
I realize I have to re-quench,
I have to re-harden this.

31:17.571 --> 31:18.659
I just wanna make sure

31:18.789 --> 31:20.008
that when it gets
to the judges,

31:20.139 --> 31:21.053
It's gonna survive

31:21.183 --> 31:21.967
whatever they throw at it.

31:24.143 --> 31:25.448
I'm not seeing any warps.

31:25.579 --> 31:28.843
So that is without
a doubt hard.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.279
It's still
a little bit beefy

31:30.410 --> 31:32.499
compared to what I wanted
in long run,

31:32.629 --> 31:34.283
but I'm satisfied with it.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.329
I'm gonna dive right in
and start working on the guard.

31:36.459 --> 31:39.027
So I'm making a template
for the dragon wing.

31:39.158 --> 31:41.334
I am taking the elements
of historical build,

31:41.464 --> 31:42.596
but I'm gonna--I'm kind of
throwing

31:42.726 --> 31:43.814
a fantasy element into it.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.294
I like dragons.

31:45.425 --> 31:46.643
I've always
loved fantasy swords,

31:46.774 --> 31:47.731
so the entire thing's gonna be

31:47.862 --> 31:49.168
dragon themed.

31:49.298 --> 31:51.474
So tomorrow, I'm gonna get
some finger rings,

31:51.605 --> 31:53.302
and then I just gotta work on
knuckle-bow

31:53.433 --> 31:55.435
and then two side bars.

31:55.565 --> 31:56.479
And we're getting somewhere.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.570
- So with my blade
mostly done,

32:00.701 --> 32:03.051
and I've already got
the clamshell guard fitted out.

32:03.182 --> 32:04.357
Guard fits.

32:04.487 --> 32:05.662
For this handle,

32:05.793 --> 32:07.403
I'm gonna go
with a nice hardwood

32:07.534 --> 32:09.753
and offset that
with different color Micarta,

32:09.884 --> 32:11.233
and then epoxy it together,

32:11.364 --> 32:13.192
so I can shape it off
of the sword.

32:13.322 --> 32:14.454
Oh, gosh.

32:14.584 --> 32:15.759
I go to remove the handle,

32:15.890 --> 32:18.284
and she's stuck.

32:21.591 --> 32:22.810
I really don't know
what the heck to do

32:22.941 --> 32:24.377
at this point.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.205
Seriously contemplating
taking this thing

32:26.335 --> 32:27.771
to the band saw.

32:27.902 --> 32:30.818
Then I look at the sword,
and the rear part is separated.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.951
I think I can save this.

32:33.081 --> 32:33.995
Try it again, second time.

32:34.126 --> 32:36.258
Ho-ho.
Imagine that.

32:36.389 --> 32:37.781
And that's how it should have
went the first time.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.483
Yeah, that came together
pretty nice.

32:43.613 --> 32:44.963
With the time I got left,

32:45.093 --> 32:46.399
I'm gonna start shaping
all these quillions

32:46.529 --> 32:49.010
and knuckle-bows
and all that froufrou stuff

32:49.141 --> 32:51.143
on the handles.

32:52.927 --> 32:54.320
- I'm really happy
with where I'm at.

32:54.450 --> 32:56.583
The elements I have to get
finished are the knuckle-bow,

32:56.713 --> 32:58.759
two side bars, and a pommel.

32:58.889 --> 33:00.195
And a knuckle-bow.

33:00.326 --> 33:01.762
The finish that I'm gonna
put on it,

33:01.892 --> 33:04.460
it's gonna look rugged,
but clean, pretty,

33:04.591 --> 33:06.723
and just overall,
a well-constructed piece.

33:06.854 --> 33:08.377
$10,000-worthy, no doubt.

33:08.508 --> 33:10.727
Dry fit up in place.
Looking good.

33:10.858 --> 33:12.294
At the end of the crossguard,

33:12.425 --> 33:15.558
I have two quillions
that--dragon fingers--claws

33:15.689 --> 33:19.345
that should be clutching
a gem or two.

33:19.475 --> 33:20.781
They look dragon-esque.

33:20.911 --> 33:23.088
That's done.

33:23.218 --> 33:24.872
It is a little bit heavy
for what I was aiming for,

33:25.003 --> 33:26.004
but it has good balance.

33:26.134 --> 33:27.179
So overall, I'm really happy

33:27.309 --> 33:29.137
with how the sword turned out.

33:29.268 --> 33:31.444
- Today's gonna be
all about fit and finish

33:31.574 --> 33:34.882
and completing this sword.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.971
The blade itself,
I'm pretty much happy

33:37.102 --> 33:38.755
with the geometry of it,

33:38.886 --> 33:41.715
but I want to see if I can
remove some weight at the tip.

33:41.845 --> 33:44.065
I want Doug to be swinging
that thing all over the place

33:44.196 --> 33:45.545
and having a good time with it.

33:49.331 --> 33:51.029
But now that everything's
permanently fixed,

33:51.159 --> 33:52.682
just gotta clean it up,
sharp it up a little bit.

33:52.813 --> 33:55.555
I can't wait to see
the judges test this thing.

34:02.214 --> 34:04.216
- Jesse, Teddy,
welcome back to The Forge.

34:04.346 --> 34:06.435
You guys have had four days
at your home forges

34:06.566 --> 34:08.220
to work on your rapiers.

34:08.350 --> 34:10.613
Jesse, tell us a little bit
about your blade.

34:12.311 --> 34:15.705
- It's 80CRV2
with some Micarta and wood

34:15.836 --> 34:17.838
split up on the handle

34:17.968 --> 34:20.058
and mild steel
for everything else.

34:20.188 --> 34:22.190
- All right, Teddy,
how's your blade measuring up?

34:22.321 --> 34:23.365
- I think it's good.

34:23.496 --> 34:26.064
It's 5160,

34:26.194 --> 34:27.500
purpleheart on the handle.

34:27.630 --> 34:28.762
I used a little bit of 4130
on the guard

34:28.892 --> 34:30.546
along with some mild steel.

34:30.677 --> 34:31.721
It turned out great.

34:31.852 --> 34:32.983
- All right, gentlemen.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.463
The judges will now
put your blades

34:34.594 --> 34:36.030
through a series
of three tests.

34:36.161 --> 34:37.771
There will be a strength test,
a sharpness test,

34:37.901 --> 34:39.512
and up first, the KEAL test.

34:39.642 --> 34:40.991
Doug.

34:43.037 --> 34:45.648
- All right, bladesmiths.
Welcome to the KEAL test.

34:47.563 --> 34:48.564
I'm gonna take your rapiers

34:48.695 --> 34:50.392
and deliver
some killing slashes

34:50.523 --> 34:52.786
and thrusts
on this pig carcass.

34:52.916 --> 34:54.353
For these musketeer swords,

34:54.483 --> 34:56.442
it's time to find out if you're
all for one champion

34:56.572 --> 34:58.487
or one for all the runner-ups.

35:00.185 --> 35:01.142
Jesse, you're up first.
You ready for this?

35:01.273 --> 35:02.187
- Let's cut some bacon.

35:02.317 --> 35:03.362
- All right, let's do this.

35:05.015 --> 35:07.192
- To be chopping into
a full size pig,

35:07.322 --> 35:08.932
this is crazy.

35:09.063 --> 35:10.108
I'm worried,
because there's bones

35:10.238 --> 35:11.761
inside that pig.

35:11.892 --> 35:13.894
But at this point,
it's in the judges' hands,

35:14.024 --> 35:15.200
and I can't wait to see
what happens.

35:28.735 --> 35:30.171
Yes!
- Whoa.

35:30.302 --> 35:32.347
- Dude.

35:32.478 --> 35:34.567
He got a workout.

35:34.697 --> 35:38.614
- All right, Jesse.
This edge is sharp.

35:38.745 --> 35:42.488
A rapier cut a pig in half.
That's very interesting.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.054
For every slash,

35:44.185 --> 35:46.231
the edge lands exactly where
I want it to be.

35:46.361 --> 35:47.319
- Okay.

35:47.449 --> 35:49.147
- Overall, sir, for this test,

35:49.277 --> 35:50.278
it will KEAL.

35:50.409 --> 35:52.237
- Yes!

35:52.367 --> 35:54.804
- All right, ready, Teddy?
- Let's do it.

35:54.935 --> 35:56.110
- Let's do this.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.590
- I'm nervous.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.722
Jesse goes first,
and Doug takes his sword

35:59.853 --> 36:02.029
and delivers
some massive slashes,

36:02.160 --> 36:03.552
then he cuts the pig in half.

36:03.683 --> 36:05.206
So I hope mine can match that.

36:30.318 --> 36:32.799
- All right, Teddy.
Your edge.

36:32.929 --> 36:34.496
When you are slashing
with the razor's edge

36:34.627 --> 36:37.760
that you have on your blade,
it slices easily

36:37.891 --> 36:40.198
and deeply on this big carcass.

36:40.328 --> 36:42.200
Your weapon, sir,
will KEAL.

36:42.330 --> 36:43.505
- Awesome.
- Nice.

36:45.725 --> 36:48.031
- All right, gentlemen, it's
time for the strength test.

36:48.162 --> 36:51.209
A little thing I like to call
the Wheel of Pain.

36:51.339 --> 36:55.822
Now a rapier needs to be a
fast, light, flexible weapon.

36:55.952 --> 36:58.303
We're gonna see how flexible
yours are.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.305
All right, Jesse,
so I've got your blade

37:00.435 --> 37:02.437
strapped into our
Wheel of Pain right now.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.570
Now I'm going to be flexing it
in both directions.

37:04.700 --> 37:07.442
I'll be taking it all the way
to that far red peg,

37:07.573 --> 37:09.444
holding it for about three
seconds.

37:09.575 --> 37:11.185
We'll see if it come
back true

37:11.316 --> 37:12.273
and then we're going
the other direction.

37:12.404 --> 37:14.623
All right?
- Go nuts.

37:14.754 --> 37:16.625
That ship sailed.

37:18.584 --> 37:20.586
- So my blade's strapped into
this crazy machine

37:20.716 --> 37:23.589
that's about to get pulled
and pushed and bent

37:23.719 --> 37:26.896
beyond its limits
and I'm freaking out.

37:27.027 --> 37:29.986
You've got your precious baby
that you've worked so hard on

37:30.117 --> 37:32.641
right there and $10,000 on
the other side of it.

37:36.515 --> 37:37.864
On paper,

37:37.994 --> 37:40.083
my sword should
handle this with no problem.

37:40.214 --> 37:41.737
But there's always
that unknown,

37:41.868 --> 37:43.348
and I'm fully freaking out

37:43.478 --> 37:45.132
thinking that it's gonna
just snap.

38:26.739 --> 38:28.218
- Comes back to true, dude.

38:30.612 --> 38:32.658
- Are you kidding me?

38:32.788 --> 38:35.661
- Okay, Jesse,
first off,

38:35.791 --> 38:37.315
remarkable, but I mean,

38:37.445 --> 38:40.013
there's a lot of weight
in this blade, a lot of mass.

38:40.143 --> 38:42.363
So to have it flex the way it
did

38:42.494 --> 38:44.800
and come back
virtually to true--

38:44.931 --> 38:47.455
this blade is still straight
enough to fight with,

38:47.586 --> 38:48.674
which is excellent.

38:48.804 --> 38:49.762
- Thank you.
- Good job.

38:49.892 --> 38:51.241
- Thank you.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.679
- Teddy, you ready for this?
- Let's do it.

39:38.811 --> 39:41.335
Holy crap.

39:41.466 --> 39:44.599
There's a pretty significant
bend in the blade.

39:44.730 --> 39:46.122
I'm definitely terrified
at this point.

39:49.299 --> 39:51.998
- So Teddy, you can see
where it took the bends

39:52.128 --> 39:53.042
here and here

39:53.173 --> 39:55.044
and the initial bend,

39:55.175 --> 39:57.525
it actually bent this way,
and then we bent it back

39:57.656 --> 39:59.701
and it went the other way,

39:59.832 --> 40:02.008
so it leaves some question
about the heat treat--

40:02.138 --> 40:05.751
you know, how--how even
it is through the blade.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.230
You know, it's just...

40:07.361 --> 40:09.972
I worry about that bend.

40:10.103 --> 40:11.147
- Yeah.

40:15.021 --> 40:17.197
So guys...

40:17.327 --> 40:20.592
I mean, you know,
it's a finesse weapon.

40:20.722 --> 40:23.769
These things are about speed
and accuracy, light and fast.

40:26.989 --> 40:29.383
- Bladesmiths,
a musketeer's rapier

40:29.514 --> 40:30.776
is a finesse weapon,

40:30.906 --> 40:32.125
and Teddy, unfortunately,

40:32.255 --> 40:34.257
a less than perfect heat treat

40:34.388 --> 40:37.609
has led to your rapier
taking a permanent bend.

40:37.739 --> 40:40.176
Now this is gonna affect
accuracy

40:40.307 --> 40:42.440
when it comes to the use
of the weapon

40:42.570 --> 40:44.093
in our sharpness test.

40:44.224 --> 40:46.574
And for that reason, this is
a catastrophic failure

40:46.705 --> 40:48.663
and you cannot continue
with this competition.

40:48.794 --> 40:49.838
Come on forward, my friend.

40:52.058 --> 40:53.146
Good job, man.

40:53.276 --> 40:54.974
- I'm definitely not happy.

40:55.104 --> 40:58.238
No one enjoys having anything
they build not work properly.

40:58.368 --> 40:59.457
I've had a blast.

40:59.587 --> 41:01.110
I've made a few good friends.

41:01.241 --> 41:03.373
I've been able to take time
and build something

41:03.504 --> 41:04.636
I otherwise wouldn't have
built,

41:04.766 --> 41:08.640
so the experience has
been great.

41:08.770 --> 41:10.598
- Jesse, congratulations.

41:10.729 --> 41:12.644
You are the Forged in Fire
champion

41:12.774 --> 41:15.211
and that is a title that comes
with a check for 10 grand.

41:15.342 --> 41:16.735
Good job, brother.

41:18.563 --> 41:20.390
- I'm on Cloud Nine.

41:20.521 --> 41:23.698
This is probably the most fun
I've ever had doing hard labor.

41:23.829 --> 41:26.875
I proved to myself
that I'm capable to do

41:27.006 --> 41:28.442
a whole lot more
than I thought I could.
