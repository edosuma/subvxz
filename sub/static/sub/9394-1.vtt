00:34.880 --> 00:37.514
We now return
to the <i> All in the Family</i>

00:37.550 --> 00:39.683
and <i> Modern Family</i>
crossover episode.

00:39.719 --> 00:40.884
Hello,
Mr. Bunker.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.219
We brought
some hummus.

00:42.255 --> 00:44.221
Oh, yeah, I knew
them two was hummus

00:44.257 --> 00:46.023
the minute
they walked in the door.

00:46.058 --> 00:49.860
Yay! A crossover always brings
out the best in each show!

00:49.895 --> 00:52.263
It certainly doesn't smack
of desperation.

00:52.298 --> 00:54.365
The priorities
are always creative,

00:54.400 --> 00:55.899
and not driven
by marketing or...

00:55.935 --> 00:57.368
Okay, that's
enough.

00:57.403 --> 00:59.336
Oh, my God!
What is it, Peter?

00:59.372 --> 01:01.772
Look at this. Dennis the Menace
is just shoveling snow.

01:01.807 --> 01:03.374
He's being helpful.

01:03.409 --> 01:05.242
Might as well just
call it <i> Dennis</i> now.

01:05.278 --> 01:06.844
He's not a menace.

01:06.879 --> 01:08.712
Not every strip
is gonna be hilarious.

01:08.748 --> 01:11.181
You know something? I could
do better than these idiots.

01:11.217 --> 01:13.450
I should just go down to
the paper and sell 'em my own.

01:13.486 --> 01:15.686
Well, Peter, you might be
underestimating the difficulty

01:15.688 --> 01:17.254
of writing a comic strip.

01:17.290 --> 01:19.823
As someone who occasionally
dates the creative muse,

01:19.859 --> 01:23.093
I can vouch for the unforgiving
face of a blank sheet of paper.

01:23.129 --> 01:25.629
In fact, I think it was
William Faulkner who said...

01:25.665 --> 01:27.898
I'm back. I'm published.
Check it out.

01:31.370 --> 01:33.504
I call my comic
<i>For Pete's Sake,</i>

01:33.539 --> 01:34.972
because it points out things

01:35.007 --> 01:37.841
that make you shake your head
and say, "For Pete's sake."

01:37.877 --> 01:39.343
This one's for tomorrow.

01:43.382 --> 01:44.581
These are
good, Peter.

01:44.617 --> 01:46.517
I like how
you retell tired old gags

01:46.552 --> 01:48.585
with a detached,
ironic approach.

01:48.621 --> 01:50.454
Yeah, plus,
it's all brand-new jokes

01:50.489 --> 01:52.022
that I'm really,
really serious about.

01:52.058 --> 01:53.390
Well, good for you, Peter,

01:53.426 --> 01:55.359
but how did you get published
so quickly?

01:55.394 --> 01:57.728
Ah, the editor of the paper
owed me a favor.

01:57.763 --> 01:59.396
I got him a picture
of Spider-Man.

01:59.432 --> 02:02.066
Why can't anyone get me
a picture of the Spider-Man?!

02:02.101 --> 02:03.734
Here you go.

02:06.372 --> 02:09.907
Yeah, I got a whole subreddit
of superhero thong shots.

02:13.079 --> 02:15.279
Here's your beer, Peter.

02:15.314 --> 02:16.714
Thanks, Jerome.
What do I owe you?

02:16.749 --> 02:19.216
Nah, you already
paid me... in laughs.

02:24.223 --> 02:25.756
I do a lot of island ones.

02:25.791 --> 02:27.024
Peter, you
should do one

02:27.059 --> 02:29.093
where a baseball player
can't steal second,

02:29.128 --> 02:30.828
'cause he's
on probation.

02:30.863 --> 02:32.429
For drug crimes.

02:32.465 --> 02:33.731
Political.

02:33.766 --> 02:35.432
Yeah, you put an island
in there, you're in business.

02:35.468 --> 02:37.201
Hey, how about one
where you draw a sock,

02:37.236 --> 02:38.702
and it says "Sock it to me,"

02:38.738 --> 02:41.071
or-or maybe draw Lois
taking a hot-tub dump,

02:41.107 --> 02:42.940
and she just says whatever?

02:48.848 --> 02:50.848
Peter, your comic
in this morning's paper

02:50.883 --> 02:52.649
is really offensive.

02:57.323 --> 02:58.956
That's not funny, Peter.

02:58.991 --> 03:00.624
Ah, you're just not
getting it, Lois.

03:00.659 --> 03:02.559
See, his wife washed
dishes for him.

03:02.595 --> 03:04.094
Oh, for Pete's sake.

03:04.130 --> 03:06.630
Aha! There you go.

03:06.665 --> 03:07.898
Peter, you should see this.

03:07.933 --> 03:09.233
Your dishwasher cartoon

03:09.268 --> 03:10.901
has really outraged
the online community.

03:10.936 --> 03:12.169
What?

03:12.204 --> 03:13.570
Gosh, it's not
like the Internet

03:13.606 --> 03:15.639
to go crazy about something
small and stupid.

03:15.674 --> 03:17.007
Peter, you have
to apologize.

03:17.042 --> 03:18.308
What, because of a joke?

03:18.344 --> 03:19.543
Not just a joke, Peter.

03:19.578 --> 03:21.812
A joke that angered some bloggers.

03:21.847 --> 03:23.313
Well, I guess this
ain't the first time

03:23.349 --> 03:25.416
I got in trouble for something
I said about a woman.

03:26.952 --> 03:29.253
Oh, good.
We can steal.

03:35.194 --> 03:36.994
And welcome back
to <i> The Flow.</i>

03:37.029 --> 03:38.262
We're talking
to Peter Griffin,

03:38.297 --> 03:40.264
the artist behind
<i>For Pete's Sake,</i>

03:40.299 --> 03:43.100
which has caused outrage
with a misogynistic comic.

03:43.135 --> 03:44.635
Here's a video
of some outrage.

03:48.574 --> 03:50.474
Boo!

03:50.509 --> 03:52.276
Yeah, those boos
don't hurt so much

03:52.311 --> 03:54.545
'cause you spent two minutes
of the last segment

03:54.580 --> 03:56.313
applauding a red velvet cake.

03:56.348 --> 03:57.781
Ah!

04:00.052 --> 04:01.452
And if that's not bad enough,

04:01.487 --> 04:03.053
this morning's cartoon
is even worse.

04:03.088 --> 04:04.488
Let's put that up.

04:10.496 --> 04:12.296
Mr. Griffin,
do you really think

04:12.331 --> 04:13.997
this is an
appropriate cartoon

04:14.033 --> 04:15.833
to run on Gloria Steinem's
half-birthday?

04:15.868 --> 04:17.000
You sound angry.

04:17.036 --> 04:18.635
Did one of your
friends get engaged?

04:18.671 --> 04:21.471
You have no idea how offensive
you are to women, do you?

04:21.507 --> 04:22.673
What?! I love women.

04:22.708 --> 04:24.908
I bet I can name more
porn stars than you.

04:24.944 --> 04:27.211
But-but don't tell my wife
how many porn stars I know.

04:27.246 --> 04:28.645
I'll get in a
lot of trouble.

04:28.681 --> 04:29.913
I know all of
'em, though.

04:29.949 --> 04:31.081
There are people

04:31.116 --> 04:32.749
who just started an hour
ago, and I know 'em.

04:35.788 --> 04:37.521
Your cartoon is sexist!

04:37.556 --> 04:39.156
Down with misogyny!

04:39.191 --> 04:42.893
It wasn't even funny, and
I have a great sense of humor.

04:42.928 --> 04:45.162
Man, they seem really upset.

04:45.197 --> 04:46.997
I was just trying
to make people laugh.

04:47.032 --> 04:48.866
Dad, I'm worried
they're gonna hurt us.

04:48.901 --> 04:50.234
No, no,
they're angry, Chris,

04:50.269 --> 04:52.236
but they ain't
gonna get violent.

04:52.271 --> 04:54.571
Oh, cool!
That brick I ordered.

04:54.607 --> 04:56.640
Wait a minute.
I didn't order <i> this</i> brick.

04:56.675 --> 04:57.875
You may be right, Chris.

04:57.910 --> 04:59.443
Peter, this is
getting out of hand.

04:59.478 --> 05:01.111
I don't feel safe
in my own home.

05:01.146 --> 05:03.413
Maybe we should get out
of Quahog for a while.

05:03.449 --> 05:04.748
You know, she's right.

05:04.783 --> 05:06.450
We should get out of town
till this all blows over.

05:06.485 --> 05:08.552
Okay, we'll go,
but just give me a minute.

05:08.587 --> 05:10.921
I just want to turn in
my last <i> For Pete's Sake.</i>

05:13.859 --> 05:17.461
<i>going out on top amid a flurry</i>
<i>of gambling rumors.</i>

05:19.000 --> 05:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:29.005 --> 05:30.603
Peter, where are we?

05:30.603 --> 05:32.045
I don't know.
I just woke up, too.

05:32.046 --> 05:33.913
I tied the steering
wheel to my belt.

05:33.947 --> 05:36.748
I figure we've been on the
road about 20% of the time.

05:36.783 --> 05:38.884
Dad, how long
until we can go back home?

05:38.919 --> 05:40.218
Um, I don't know.

05:40.254 --> 05:42.020
How long do women
hold grudges?

05:42.055 --> 05:43.588
Not very long,
I'm guessing.

05:43.624 --> 05:45.557
Oh, Peter, we've been
driving all night.

05:45.592 --> 05:47.192
Pull over
to that gas station.

05:47.227 --> 05:49.327
We can use the bathroom
and stretch our legs.

05:49.363 --> 05:50.529
You got it, babe.

05:50.564 --> 05:51.997
Did you call me "babe"?

05:52.032 --> 05:52.831
I did.

05:52.866 --> 05:54.666
Oh, Peter.

05:56.170 --> 05:57.769
Ew! Mom!

05:57.804 --> 06:00.539
You'll never
have this, Meg.

06:03.377 --> 06:05.010
All right, back
in the car, kids.

06:05.045 --> 06:07.112
For this leg of the
trip, I was thinking

06:07.147 --> 06:09.548
of driving with my shirt
off like New Mexico trash.

06:12.786 --> 06:14.719
Oh, my God!
Our car!

06:14.755 --> 06:16.121
Someone's stealing it.

06:16.156 --> 06:17.322
Ah, crap.

06:17.357 --> 06:18.523
Although, I got to say,

06:18.559 --> 06:20.859
you never get to see
somebody else driving your car.

06:20.894 --> 06:22.494
It's kind of cool.
Kind of weird.

06:22.529 --> 06:23.728
We're stuck
here, Peter!

06:23.764 --> 06:25.463
And we don't even
know where we are.

06:25.499 --> 06:27.832
Well, there's a sign.

06:44.585 --> 06:46.685
Huh, guess we're in a town
called Springfield.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.687
Springfield, eh?
What state?

06:48.722 --> 06:50.889
I can't imagine
we're allowed to say.

07:14.581 --> 07:16.414
Well, this Springfield place
seems nice.

07:16.450 --> 07:17.782
We should visit here again.

07:17.818 --> 07:20.185
I don't know, Lois. This
seems like a one-shot deal.

07:20.220 --> 07:22.053
Guys, we ain't here
for fun, all right?

07:22.089 --> 07:24.389
We're here to find the police,
report our stolen car.

07:24.424 --> 07:25.824
Oh, and don't
drink the water.

07:25.859 --> 07:27.993
Everybody around here looks
like they have hepatitis.

07:28.028 --> 07:29.561
Dad, I'm
starving.

07:29.596 --> 07:30.929
Can we get
some food?!

07:30.964 --> 07:33.298
Lois, whip out your boob,
give the boy his lunch.

07:33.333 --> 07:34.499
Listen to
the man.

07:34.534 --> 07:36.234
Yeah, Lois,
listen to the man.

07:36.270 --> 07:38.570
How about we just go into
that store there?

07:42.476 --> 07:44.142
Uh, uh, excuse me?

07:44.177 --> 07:46.378
Hello. Welcome
to the Kwik-E-Mart.

07:49.650 --> 07:51.983
Oh, I am so sorry.
Let me unplug that.

07:52.019 --> 07:54.352
Oh, such a nuisance!

07:54.388 --> 07:56.087
Hello, funny-sounding
Cleveland.

07:56.123 --> 07:57.522
What's the specialty
of the house?

07:57.557 --> 07:59.991
To you, I recommend...
the donut.

08:02.296 --> 08:03.662
Ooh!

08:03.697 --> 08:05.030
Yum!

08:05.065 --> 08:07.365
Have you guys seriously
never heard of donuts?

08:07.401 --> 08:09.134
These are made
fresh every day.

08:09.169 --> 08:11.136
And then, several days
later, we receive them

08:11.171 --> 08:12.937
and make them available
for purchase.

08:12.973 --> 08:14.706
Hey, are these...
are these free?

08:14.741 --> 08:17.876
'Cause I forgot to mention, all
our money is in our stolen car.

08:17.911 --> 08:19.411
Thank you. Come again.

08:19.446 --> 08:22.514
Sir, we can pay you back for
the donuts when we find our car.

08:22.549 --> 08:25.083
Do you think that I am moved
by your sob story?

08:25.118 --> 08:26.818
I come from a country
where the words

08:26.853 --> 08:28.687
for "sewage" and "beverage"
are the same.

08:28.722 --> 08:30.522
I'll pay for their donuts.

08:34.328 --> 08:36.160
Thank you so
much, sir.

08:36.196 --> 08:37.828
For what?
I didn't say anything.

08:37.864 --> 08:38.996
Oh.

08:39.032 --> 08:40.865
It was me.

08:44.104 --> 08:47.105
How come this convenience store
has so many shadowy parts?

08:47.140 --> 08:50.375
Apu, a dozen donuts for
our albino visitors.

08:50.410 --> 08:51.843
Wow! For real?!

08:51.878 --> 08:54.846
No man should be so poor
he cannot pay for a donut.

08:54.881 --> 08:56.381
I was once you.

08:56.416 --> 08:57.816
I couldn't afford donuts.

08:57.851 --> 09:00.151
Tell them what I did, Apu.
He stole the donuts.

09:00.187 --> 09:01.886
I stole the donuts.

09:01.922 --> 09:03.254
So, here you go.

09:03.290 --> 09:05.056
12... ten...
eight donuts.

09:05.092 --> 09:07.359
That's very nice
of you, Mister...?

09:07.394 --> 09:09.361
Simpson. Homer Simpson.

09:09.396 --> 09:10.762
We're the Griffins.

09:10.797 --> 09:13.331
Peter, Lois, Stewie, and then,
uh, you know, the others.

09:13.367 --> 09:15.200
Brian, I guess.

09:15.235 --> 09:17.435
Well, enjoy
your... six donuts.

09:19.139 --> 09:21.606
Mmm. Yummy... donut.

09:21.641 --> 09:24.008
That's pretty good,
but try it like this.

09:25.145 --> 09:27.746
Mmm. Donut.

09:28.782 --> 09:31.549
Mmm. Donut.

09:31.585 --> 09:36.488
I think you and I are
gonna get along just okay.

09:41.310 --> 09:42.910
Yeah, all right,
we'll be there.

09:42.945 --> 09:45.312
But if you want
to save us a little time,

09:45.347 --> 09:48.382
you can start
tracing his body with chalk.

09:48.417 --> 09:51.418
This is the
police station.

09:51.453 --> 09:55.856
Be careful. I think some
of them might be cops.

09:55.891 --> 09:57.724
Oh, hey there.
Cool hat, weird nose.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.226
Hey, listen,
my car got stolen.

09:59.261 --> 10:00.594
I was hoping
you could help.

10:00.629 --> 10:01.962
Well, we got
a procedure

10:01.997 --> 10:03.797
for handling alleged
crimes around here.

10:03.832 --> 10:05.499
Let's see. Uh, did
you contribute

10:05.534 --> 10:07.000
to the policeman's ball?

10:07.036 --> 10:08.402
No.

10:08.437 --> 10:10.904
Oh, that's too bad,
'cause he really needs one.

10:10.940 --> 10:12.940
He had an accident last week.

10:12.975 --> 10:15.809
Yeah, I tried to jump
over a parking meter.

10:15.844 --> 10:17.511
Yeah, all right,
well, with no contribution,

10:17.546 --> 10:20.614
your report goes right
into the circular file.

10:20.649 --> 10:22.182
I got to be honest.

10:22.217 --> 10:23.850
I don't usually check this file,

10:23.886 --> 10:26.920
so it might be a while
until we find that car of yours.

10:26.956 --> 10:30.190
Uh, Chief, that excuse to
leave you asked for is here.

10:30.225 --> 10:32.025
Oh, sorry,
I got to take this.

10:32.061 --> 10:34.461
It never ends.

10:37.666 --> 10:38.899
Oh, thank you so much

10:38.934 --> 10:41.034
for putting us up
until we find our car.

10:41.070 --> 10:43.770
And thank you for not being
a band of hippie murderers.

10:43.806 --> 10:45.439
And now
this again.

10:45.474 --> 10:47.908
You bring home two bands
of hippie murderers,

10:47.943 --> 10:49.743
and suddenly,
that's all you're about.

10:49.778 --> 10:51.745
Well, what do you say we have
some lunch?

10:51.780 --> 10:53.080
Where's
Bart?

10:53.115 --> 10:54.715
Well, he's at
camp all week.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.750
I'm sorry you
won't get to meet him.

11:00.689 --> 11:02.723
Got kicked out of camp.

11:02.758 --> 11:05.826
I superglued my counselor's
butt cheeks together.

11:05.861 --> 11:07.094
That's terrible.

11:07.129 --> 11:10.263
But how did you even get access
to his butt cheeks?

11:10.299 --> 11:12.499
I'm not the only one
who got kicked out of camp.

11:12.534 --> 11:13.633
This is Bart.

11:13.669 --> 11:15.035
Honey, your hands
are filthy.

11:15.070 --> 11:16.570
Go wash up
for lunch.

11:16.605 --> 11:18.071
Eat my shorts!

11:18.107 --> 11:19.406
"Eat my shorts."

11:19.441 --> 11:21.742
I love that!
Is that a popular expression,

11:21.777 --> 11:24.211
like "what the deuce"?
Probably more popular.

11:24.246 --> 11:26.346
Probably... probably
way more popular.

11:26.382 --> 11:29.049
Well, here's my room.

11:29.084 --> 11:30.784
Hey, you want to see
my weapons closet?

11:30.819 --> 11:33.086
You have a
weapons closet, too?

11:41.296 --> 11:44.197
Ouch! Jesus
heard my mean thought!

11:44.233 --> 11:46.400
A slingshot!
It's so simple and pure.

11:46.435 --> 11:48.535
He doesn't need lasers
or time machines,

11:48.570 --> 11:51.138
just gum balls and marbles
and balls of string.

11:51.173 --> 11:53.407
He's like something
out of Mark Twain!

11:53.442 --> 11:55.442
Whose real name
was Samuel Clemens.

11:55.477 --> 11:57.644
How... how does that further
this conversation?

11:57.679 --> 12:00.047
Hey, you want to make
a prank phone call?

12:00.082 --> 12:01.581
Ooh, prank phone call!

12:06.455 --> 12:08.155
Moe's Tavern.
Moe speaking.

12:08.190 --> 12:09.856
Uh, yeah, I'm looking
for a friend,

12:09.892 --> 12:12.492
last name Keebum,
first name Lee.

12:12.528 --> 12:13.794
Uh, hang on, I'll check.

12:13.829 --> 12:15.896
Hey, guys, do I got
a Lee Keebum?

12:15.931 --> 12:18.598
Come on, look at the stools--
is there a Lee Keebum?

12:18.634 --> 12:21.435
Somebody check the rear--
I know I got a Lee Keebum.

12:21.470 --> 12:23.670
Then you probably shouldn't
be handling food.

12:27.576 --> 12:29.109
Oh, my God,
that's amazing!

12:29.144 --> 12:30.677
That's the coolest
thing ever!

12:30.712 --> 12:32.546
Hey, I want to try.
Okay.

12:34.450 --> 12:36.116
Moe's Tavern.

12:36.151 --> 12:38.819
Hello, Moe?
Your sister's being raped.

12:38.854 --> 12:41.421
Is that... is that one?

12:41.457 --> 12:42.889
So, this is my room.

12:42.925 --> 12:44.491
Please excuse the mess.

12:44.526 --> 12:46.693
There, that's better.

12:46.728 --> 12:48.695
Look at all these trophies!

12:48.730 --> 12:50.764
There must be,
like, 20 of them!

12:50.799 --> 12:54.101
23. But I'm sure you have
a lot of trophies of your own.

12:54.136 --> 12:56.369
No. I'm not good
at anything.

12:56.405 --> 12:59.272
Oh, Meg, I'm sure
you're good at something.

12:59.308 --> 13:01.274
We just have
to find out what it is.

13:01.310 --> 13:04.744
After all, Nelson Mandela said
it's our obligation to shine.

13:04.780 --> 13:07.080
You mean like my
oily face and back?

13:07.116 --> 13:09.516
No. Maybe don't sit
on my bedspread, please.

13:09.551 --> 13:12.786
But I mean the light within you
that makes you an individual.

13:12.821 --> 13:15.288
Meg, you need to know
that you matter.

13:15.324 --> 13:17.858
Really? No one's ever
told me I mattered before.

13:17.893 --> 13:19.759
That's why <i> you</i>
have to say it.

13:19.795 --> 13:22.129
So say it.
I matter.

13:22.164 --> 13:23.164
Louder!

13:23.165 --> 13:24.431
I matter!

13:24.466 --> 13:27.634
Shut up, Meg! You don't matter!

13:45.053 --> 13:47.854
Hey, couldn't help but notice
there's no seat for me.

13:47.890 --> 13:51.591
Oh. I was under the impression
that you were a dog.

13:51.627 --> 13:53.493
You're right to have
that reaction, Marge.

13:53.529 --> 13:56.396
Why, I just figured,
at home I sit with the family,

13:56.431 --> 13:57.731
so I assumed that...

13:57.766 --> 13:59.833
Have you ever drunk
out of a toilet?

13:59.868 --> 14:02.235
I-I don't see what that has
to do with the discussion.

14:02.271 --> 14:04.070
Dogs eat in the kitchen.

14:04.106 --> 14:06.039
Yeah, dogs eat
in the kitchen.

14:06.074 --> 14:08.708
Y-You know, you're eating
mostly horse hooves

14:08.744 --> 14:10.777
and tallow, right?
You cool with that?

14:10.812 --> 14:12.979
Oh, and the ones that
fall on the floor,

14:13.015 --> 14:14.648
you just eat those
up, too, huh?

14:14.683 --> 14:16.116
Oh, yeah, yeah, you do.

14:16.151 --> 14:18.318
So, is that... is that,
like, your thing?

14:18.353 --> 14:20.687
You eat loud?

14:20.722 --> 14:23.390
I... I'm-I'm sorry,
I don't know what...

14:23.425 --> 14:24.724
That's a gutter language.

14:24.760 --> 14:27.027
Are you making friends
in there, Brian?

14:27.062 --> 14:28.828
Yep, he's a lot
of laughs.

14:28.864 --> 14:30.897
Wow, you work at a
nuclear power plant?

14:30.933 --> 14:32.566
What's that?
I don't know.

14:32.601 --> 14:33.767
Pretty impressive.

14:33.802 --> 14:35.502
I just work
at a brewery.

14:35.537 --> 14:38.171
Oh, my God,
you get to work with beer?!

14:38.207 --> 14:40.607
Wow! What's beer really like?

14:40.642 --> 14:42.876
Eh, he's got a big head.

14:42.911 --> 14:45.779
Hey, you know-- aw, damn it,
I don't have a comic strip anymore.

14:45.814 --> 14:49.249
So, still no word from the
police on your stolen car?

14:49.284 --> 14:51.585
The cops
here are a joke.

14:51.620 --> 14:54.354
I bet you and me can find
your car on our own.

14:54.389 --> 14:55.822
You think so?
Yeah.

14:55.857 --> 14:57.891
'Cause Homer Simpson
and Peter Griffin

14:57.926 --> 14:59.626
are a great team!

14:59.661 --> 15:01.895
A greater team than...

15:01.930 --> 15:04.364
Than...
Uh-huh, keep going.

15:04.399 --> 15:06.433
Than... something else.

15:06.468 --> 15:08.702
Something else?
I... don't know what this is.

15:08.737 --> 15:10.670
O-Okay,
I'll do it.

15:10.706 --> 15:13.306
Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin
are an even greater team

15:13.342 --> 15:14.808
than the Air Force!

15:16.845 --> 15:19.379
Hold steady.
I got him in my sights.

15:24.419 --> 15:26.052
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah-heh-heh!

15:26.088 --> 15:28.321
Yeah, we did it.
What's he doing here?

15:28.357 --> 15:31.124
We got to carry him,
'cause he can't fly on his own.

15:31.159 --> 15:33.393
We let that other guy try,
and look what happened.

15:33.428 --> 15:37.097
No, no, no, no, no, no...!

15:41.937 --> 15:45.005
Wow, they've made a lot
of changes to Quahog!

15:45.040 --> 15:47.107
Chris, we're
in a different town.

15:47.142 --> 15:48.275
Oh...

15:48.310 --> 15:50.543
Is that why there was
blood in my stool?

15:50.579 --> 15:52.679
No. That-that sounds
like a separate issue.

15:52.714 --> 15:54.648
God, I can't believe
I got stuck

15:54.683 --> 15:56.516
taking their stupid dog
for a walk.

15:56.551 --> 15:59.219
Stupid? Well, I don't know,
I think he's kind of fun.

15:59.254 --> 16:01.154
What, are you kidding?
He doesn't do anything.

16:01.189 --> 16:02.856
You know,
it's not his fault, though.

16:02.891 --> 16:04.357
He doesn't know any better.

16:04.393 --> 16:06.459
He's been on a leash
his whole life.

16:06.495 --> 16:08.762
Hey, you know what?
Come here, Santa's Stupid Name.

16:08.797 --> 16:12.332
You're a grown dog--
start acting like one.

16:14.770 --> 16:16.836
Come here, boy.

16:18.206 --> 16:19.739
Hey, stop that dog!

16:21.043 --> 16:23.310
Sorry. We're
on a smoke break.

16:25.714 --> 16:27.881
Nothing beats
smoking and standing.

16:27.916 --> 16:31.484
Although smoking and sitting
does have its moments.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.688
You always have
to argue with me.

16:39.294 --> 16:41.094
Oh, thank goodness!

16:41.129 --> 16:44.664
I was starting to think
you wouldn't show, Dr. Dog.

16:48.937 --> 16:52.605
Boy, you really like
to bleed, huh, guy?

16:59.381 --> 17:02.282
Hey, there's a dog
in the dining area!

17:02.317 --> 17:03.850
How'd that happen?

17:03.885 --> 17:05.719
Get back in there.

17:10.625 --> 17:12.224
Which one is Santa's
Little Helper?

17:12.260 --> 17:14.861
I don't know. You're the one who
sniffed his butt.

17:14.896 --> 17:16.563
Yeah, for, like,
a second!

17:18.867 --> 17:20.200
Damn it, he's gone.

17:20.234 --> 17:21.667
We're screwed.

17:21.703 --> 17:24.537
Welcome to Krusty Burger.
May I take your order?

17:24.573 --> 17:27.272
Your voice
sounds stupid.

17:47.129 --> 17:48.928
Oh, my God,
that was great!

17:48.964 --> 17:51.898
I mean, unless you think it sucked,
in which case it sucked.

17:51.933 --> 17:53.233
It was all right, dude.

17:53.268 --> 17:54.534
Yeah, dude.

17:54.569 --> 17:56.736
So, you know, um,
I'm only wearing this diaper

17:56.772 --> 17:59.539
as a dare, you know-- it's not,
like, an everyday thing.

17:59.574 --> 18:01.941
Hey, loser, I copied
off your spelling test

18:01.977 --> 18:04.244
and got a D!

18:04.279 --> 18:06.146
Haw-haw!

18:06.181 --> 18:09.115
I say, how long has that boy
been treating you like that?

18:09.151 --> 18:13.787
Uh...
about 24 years.

18:15.524 --> 18:16.923
Aah!

18:21.396 --> 18:23.963
Just who I was
looking for!

18:29.671 --> 18:31.938
Cowabunga.

18:35.131 --> 18:37.231
All right, Peter, if we're
gonna find your car,

18:37.267 --> 18:38.867
we got to think
like a car.

18:38.902 --> 18:41.336
So let's fill up
at that gas station.

18:48.812 --> 18:50.779
I feel sick.
Keep drinking.

18:50.814 --> 18:52.614
I prepaid 40 bucks!

18:52.649 --> 18:54.649
Homer, maybe
we're doing this wrong.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.222
Oh, crap.

19:05.395 --> 19:08.430
<i>Haben Sie Homer und</i>
<i>Peter MIT Chevron pump?</i>

19:13.237 --> 19:17.205
Okay, I got a great idea how
we're gonna find my stolen car.

19:17.241 --> 19:20.442
We'll throw a car wash--
free for stolen cars!

19:20.477 --> 19:24.012
And then when we find it,
we'll actually charge the guy!

19:33.824 --> 19:35.590
Well, none of these
is my car,

19:35.626 --> 19:37.893
but we promised
these scumbags a show.

Hey, Chief, we could arrest every single

After the show, Lou,

20:43.527 --> 20:45.860
after the show.

20:56.673 --> 21:01.409
I don't know!
I feel like I'm good at nothing!

21:01.445 --> 21:04.246
Hey, everyone gets down
on themselves sometimes.

21:04.281 --> 21:08.083
Those are the days
I'm glad I have my saxophone.

21:08.118 --> 21:09.118
Saxophone?

21:09.119 --> 21:10.785
Yeah. My dad
gave it to me.

21:10.821 --> 21:12.988
My dad once gave me
a gun to hide.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.623
That's terrible.

21:14.658 --> 21:16.825
Whenever I feel
any pain or loneliness,

21:16.860 --> 21:19.728
I just play away the blues
on my saxophone.

21:19.763 --> 21:22.330
Huh. I usually
just beat up a cat.

21:23.533 --> 21:26.401
Good thing we don't have a cat.

21:26.436 --> 21:29.070
Why don't you
give it a shot?

22:05.609 --> 22:07.075
Was that good?

22:07.110 --> 22:09.678
It was okay, but it would
be a shame to waste

22:09.713 --> 22:13.214
such great butcher's arms
on a musical instrument.

22:20.724 --> 22:22.991
Wakey, wakey.

22:23.026 --> 22:24.392
Good morning.

22:24.428 --> 22:26.795
You and I have quite a day
ahead of us.

22:38.241 --> 22:42.077
Oh, that's a clown I painted,
so you know I'm truly insane.

22:42.112 --> 22:44.346
You know, Nelson,

22:44.381 --> 22:46.748
I don't doubt that you've
had a twisted childhood.

22:46.783 --> 22:48.149
Most evil people have.

22:48.185 --> 22:50.485
Hitler, Manson, Jaden Smith.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.554
But you're different
from them, aren't you?

22:52.589 --> 22:54.989
Because they're rail-thin,
and you're fat.

22:55.025 --> 22:56.858
You're a little piggy,
aren't you, Nelson?

22:56.893 --> 22:58.860
In fact, I bet
you're hungry right now.

22:58.895 --> 23:01.162
What's that?

23:02.199 --> 23:03.431
I could eat.

23:03.467 --> 23:05.100
Good. Because you're going

23:05.135 --> 23:08.203
to eat... my... shorts.

23:15.912 --> 23:18.546
Homer, you're never going
to believe what we did.

23:18.582 --> 23:21.282
We saw a movie
in the afternoon!

23:21.318 --> 23:23.418
Yeah, we saw
<i>Surf's Up 2.</i>

23:23.453 --> 23:26.087
Marge covered her eyes every
time the penguins surfed.

23:26.123 --> 23:29.224
It made me nervous.
They could drown.

23:29.259 --> 23:31.559
Hey, where's
Santa's Little Helper?

23:31.595 --> 23:34.062
Brian, you took him
for a walk, right?

23:34.097 --> 23:36.030
Uh, yeah, yeah.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.565
More-more like he took me
for a walk.

23:37.601 --> 23:39.768
God, what a...
what a fun dog.

23:39.803 --> 23:42.704
He's in the kitchen right now,
totally accounted for.

23:42.739 --> 23:44.038
Shut up.

23:44.074 --> 23:46.374
I'll, uh... I'll go check
on him right now.

23:46.410 --> 23:48.042
And Chris
will come with me.

23:48.078 --> 23:50.078
But nobody else!

23:52.783 --> 23:54.416
BRIAN
Ruff! Ruff, ruff!

23:54.451 --> 23:56.284
Ah, there he is!

23:56.319 --> 23:59.053
Aw, you like that
behind the ear, don't you, boy?

23:59.089 --> 24:00.188
Ruff! Ruff, ruff!

24:00.223 --> 24:03.324
Ruff, ruff! I'm
another dog in here!

24:03.360 --> 24:04.659
What the hell are you doing?

24:04.694 --> 24:06.728
He's having a
dog playdate.

24:06.763 --> 24:10.131
How does that help us?
We're creating a broad story.

24:10.167 --> 24:12.600
Also, Matthew McConaughey
is in here, too!

24:12.636 --> 24:14.736
"All right, all right, all right."

24:14.771 --> 24:17.205
No, no, he's-he's not
really in here! He's...

24:17.240 --> 24:19.507
We-we thought it was him,
but it was just the oven!

24:19.543 --> 24:20.575
Now you're just doing voices.

24:20.610 --> 24:22.777
Jack Nicholson?!

24:22.813 --> 24:25.313
Okay, Santa's Little Helper
got all tuckered out

24:25.348 --> 24:27.982
from his playdate, so he went
out back to take a nap

24:28.018 --> 24:30.251
under that tree where nobody
knows quite where it is.

24:30.287 --> 24:31.786
Hey, what happened
to Jack Nicholson

24:31.822 --> 24:33.421
and that other dog?
Yep.

24:33.457 --> 24:36.191
Wait, aren't you supposed
to be looking for our car?

24:36.226 --> 24:37.325
Didn't find the car, Lois,

24:37.360 --> 24:39.227
but I found a good
time with a good pal.

24:39.262 --> 24:41.896
Right, Homer? Hey,
Quagmire who, right?

24:41.932 --> 24:43.965
Yeah, Quagmire who?

24:44.000 --> 24:47.101
That's an actual question.
I don't know who Quagmire is.

24:47.137 --> 24:50.505
Peter, I'm glad you made a
friend, but what about our car?

24:50.540 --> 24:52.040
Yeah, I got an idea
about that.

24:52.075 --> 24:55.043
What's the one surefire way
to find a lost car?

24:55.078 --> 24:58.179
Giant magnet?
Giant magnet.

24:59.216 --> 25:00.348
Giant magnet?

25:03.053 --> 25:04.352
Check.

25:04.387 --> 25:05.687
Giant plug?
Check.

25:05.722 --> 25:08.323
Giant curbside outlet?

25:11.428 --> 25:14.996
Oh, things never work
the way they do on the box.

25:18.168 --> 25:20.008
Okay, let's get this garbage
out of the street.

25:23.406 --> 25:28.042
Oh, dear, I was using that car
as pants.

25:28.078 --> 25:30.311
Oh, my God, Dad,
it's our car!

25:30.347 --> 25:33.915
That confused old guy must have
been driving it by mistake.

25:33.950 --> 25:36.851
How many confused old guys
you got in this town?

25:39.623 --> 25:41.923
I'm old, so I'm the victim!

25:45.729 --> 25:48.096
Well, Homer, thanks
for helping me get my car back.

25:48.131 --> 25:50.899
And to show my appreciation, I
got a little something for you.

25:50.934 --> 25:53.234
Here you go.
Pawtucket Patriot Ale.

25:53.270 --> 25:55.236
The best Quahog
has to offer.

25:55.272 --> 25:58.006
Always keep an emergency
six-pack in my trunk.

25:58.041 --> 26:00.942
Oh, that's cool, bringing
outside beer into my bar.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.911
Down the hatch!

26:04.581 --> 26:06.114
That's pretty good, right?

26:07.150 --> 26:08.783
No.

26:08.818 --> 26:10.785
Huh?
It's not good.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.453
This beer tastes exactly
like Duff.

26:12.489 --> 26:14.455
It's just a lousy rip-off.

26:14.491 --> 26:16.524
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's not a rip-off of Duff.

26:16.560 --> 26:19.994
It may have been inspired
by Duff, but I-I like to think

26:20.030 --> 26:21.696
it goes in
a different direction.

26:21.731 --> 26:24.866
No, this is just the same
as Duff, but, like, worse.

26:24.901 --> 26:27.869
Hey, come on, now, this is
my favorite beer you're talking about.

26:27.904 --> 26:29.871
Hell, I work for the company.
It's my livelihood.

26:29.906 --> 26:32.540
Oh, yeah? Well, your livelihood
is based on fraud.

26:32.576 --> 26:33.708
Look at this.

26:34.477 --> 26:36.978
Huh?

26:37.013 --> 26:38.313
It is Duff.

26:38.348 --> 26:40.615
Your beer is
in big trouble!

26:40.650 --> 26:42.283
You can't just slap
a new label on something

26:42.319 --> 26:43.418
and call it your own!

26:43.453 --> 26:45.753
Well, maybe Duff should be
in trouble for,

26:45.789 --> 26:47.689
you know,
not being that great.

26:49.059 --> 26:51.392
Duff is an icon!

26:51.428 --> 26:53.328
Yeah, but some folks
prefer Pawtucket Pat.

26:53.363 --> 26:56.531
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I-I used to love Duff when I was younger,

26:56.566 --> 26:59.434
but I-I haven't even had it
in, like, 13 years.

26:59.469 --> 27:00.702
Be that as it may,

27:00.737 --> 27:03.304
I represent the Duff Brewery,
and you, sir,

27:03.340 --> 27:05.640
as a representative
of Pawtucket Patriot Ale,

27:05.675 --> 27:09.277
are being sued for intellectual
theft and patent infringement.

27:09.312 --> 27:11.112
Aha! Intellectual theft!

27:11.147 --> 27:13.348
What do you have to say
about that, Griffin?

27:13.383 --> 27:14.716
D'oh!

27:27.421 --> 27:30.121
The Pawtucket Patriot
Brewery being sued?

27:30.157 --> 27:32.657
It's the largest employer
in Quahog, Peter.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.993
A lot of people's jobs
are riding on this.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.329
Yeah, I got a job for you
riding on something.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.396
Peter!

27:38.432 --> 27:39.998
Sorry! Sorry, Lois,
I'm-I'm tired

27:40.033 --> 27:43.034
'cause we usually only do
these things for half an hour.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.237
Simpson.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.273
Griffin.

27:47.274 --> 27:48.440
Nice day, isn't it?

27:48.475 --> 27:50.241
A nice day for stabbing
a friend in the back.

27:50.277 --> 27:53.812
Yeah, and a nice day for
bringing thieves to justice.

27:54.948 --> 27:56.715
We're getting a
lot of compliments.

27:56.750 --> 27:59.217
Yep, we're doing
something right.

28:01.788 --> 28:04.222
Your Honor,
citizens of Springfield

28:04.257 --> 28:06.958
and visitors from Quahog,
my client, the Duff Brewery,

28:06.994 --> 28:10.061
is the victim of flagrant
intellectual theft.

28:10.097 --> 28:12.731
I'm whispering in court
to look smart.

28:12.766 --> 28:16.067
But it's not just the main Duff
recipe that's been plagiarized.

28:16.103 --> 28:18.570
Several other Duff variations,
packages

28:18.605 --> 28:21.172
and design elements
have been similarly infringed,

28:21.208 --> 28:23.074
resulting again

28:23.110 --> 28:25.010
and again in pale imitations,

28:25.045 --> 28:26.211
chp coes,
clumsy counterfeits

28:26.246 --> 28:29.447
and weak substitutions.

28:29.483 --> 28:31.116
You like sex?
Eh.

28:31.151 --> 28:32.851
I don't think
we're very similar.

28:32.886 --> 28:35.653
You know why they got us
sitting next to each other.

28:35.689 --> 28:38.323
Uh, 'cause we're the two
funniest guys in our towns?

28:38.358 --> 28:39.791
Damn right.

28:39.826 --> 28:41.292
I'm a Jewish clown.

28:41.328 --> 28:42.694
Me, too.

28:42.729 --> 28:44.863
Are you a mayor?
Yes, I am.

28:44.898 --> 28:46.865
Are you a "cool" mayor?

28:46.900 --> 28:49.434
I, uh... I like
to think so.

28:52.472 --> 28:53.772
You lived in Springfield?

28:53.807 --> 28:56.641
Yeah, I worked at the
Kwik-E-Mart, researching a role.

28:56.676 --> 28:58.910
These guys are gonna lose.

28:58.945 --> 29:02.514
I've heard all I need to
hear to make a decision.

29:02.549 --> 29:06.117
If you ask me, neither of
these beers is wholly original.

29:06.153 --> 29:10.055
They're both pale imitations
of my favorite beer, Bud Rock.

29:10.090 --> 29:11.356
- Oh, ho, ho!
- Ooh!

29:11.391 --> 29:13.825
But rendering a verdict
is something

29:13.860 --> 29:17.095
I'm paid to yabba-dabba-do!

29:17.130 --> 29:18.430
Eh.

29:18.465 --> 29:21.032
And I find in favor of Duff.

29:21.068 --> 29:21.933
Oh, no!

29:21.968 --> 29:22.767
Oh, no!

29:22.803 --> 29:24.135
Oh, no!

29:27.641 --> 29:28.773
Hello?

29:28.809 --> 29:29.874
Uh, hey.

29:29.910 --> 29:32.110
I'm-I'm
in the wrong Springfield.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.716
So what's going
to happen now?

29:38.752 --> 29:41.186
Well, the Pawtucket Brewery
will be shut down,

29:41.221 --> 29:45.090
so I guess we got to go back to
Quahog and find Peter a new job.

29:45.125 --> 29:46.691
Mmm, that's too bad.

29:46.726 --> 29:50.028
Yeah. Anyways, it was still nice
to meet you and your family,

29:50.063 --> 29:52.363
even though you kind of
screwed us over.

29:52.399 --> 29:53.832
Good to have you.

29:53.867 --> 29:56.000
And, hey, next time
you stay with a family,

29:56.036 --> 29:59.170
maybe you can wear a
bra some of the time.

29:59.206 --> 30:02.107
Hey, uh, Marge, uh,

30:02.142 --> 30:04.382
listen, there's something
difficult that I've been trying

30:04.411 --> 30:06.878
to figure out how to
tell you, and, um...

30:06.913 --> 30:09.747
it's about, uh,
Santa's Little Helper.

30:09.783 --> 30:10.982
What about him?

30:11.017 --> 30:12.717
He's, um...

30:14.821 --> 30:16.754
...right there.

30:16.790 --> 30:19.424
You were trying to figure out
a way to tell me that?

30:19.459 --> 30:21.226
I overthink things
sometimes.

30:21.261 --> 30:23.561
Oh, and, look,
he's with Ed McMahon!

30:23.597 --> 30:25.263
Hey-o!

30:25.298 --> 30:26.764
Here's Johnny!

30:26.800 --> 30:28.099
Chris, we're done.

30:28.135 --> 30:31.102
You may be, but...
"I'm just getting warmed up!"

30:31.138 --> 30:33.638
That's Al Pacino.

30:33.673 --> 30:35.573
Thanks for being
so cool, Lisa.

30:35.609 --> 30:38.209
I cut your name in my arm
so I'll always remember you.

30:41.581 --> 30:43.715
Meg, I want you to have this.

30:43.750 --> 30:45.016
Your saxophone?

30:45.051 --> 30:49.324
Yes, Meg.
When you played the saxophone,

30:52.196 --> 30:56.164
Lisa, no one has ever done
anything this nice for me.

30:56.200 --> 30:59.568
You're amazing,
and I will never be like you.

30:59.603 --> 31:02.704
I'm not pretty, I'm not smart,
I'm not talented.

31:02.740 --> 31:04.973
I have the same shoe size
as Charles Barkley.

31:05.008 --> 31:06.842
My prom date
was a scarecrow I stole,

31:06.877 --> 31:08.577
and he left
with someone else.

31:08.612 --> 31:11.113
The inside of my hat
smells so bad I'm not allowed

31:11.148 --> 31:13.348
in most restaurants...
Hey, hey!

31:13.384 --> 31:15.350
Shut up, Meg.

31:22.593 --> 31:25.060
No luggage. Car's full.
Let's go.

31:26.063 --> 31:27.696
Well, nice knowing you,
Stewie.

31:27.731 --> 31:29.164
Same here, Bart.

31:29.199 --> 31:30.665
Hey, I hope
you don't mind,

31:30.701 --> 31:32.667
I got you a
little present.

31:35.406 --> 31:37.372
Whoa. Is that Nelson?

31:37.408 --> 31:39.174
Stewie, what the deuce?

31:39.209 --> 31:41.176
Yes, I... Oh!
Oh, that's nice.

31:41.211 --> 31:43.111
You got that from me.
'Cause, you know,

31:43.147 --> 31:45.313
I was starting to worry
this was a one-way thing.

31:45.349 --> 31:47.048
You kidnapped him?

31:47.084 --> 31:49.017
I kidnapped all your enemies.

31:49.052 --> 31:52.487
Nelson, Jimbo, Principal
Skinner, Sideshow Bob, Apu.

31:52.523 --> 31:55.290
I know Apu's not your enemy,
but I just wanted to say,

31:55.325 --> 31:57.726
"I took Apu."

31:57.761 --> 32:00.128
That is funny!

32:00.164 --> 32:01.997
But the rest of this?
It's messed up, man.

32:02.032 --> 32:03.632
I know! Isn't it awesome?

32:03.667 --> 32:06.001
So, how do you want to keep
in touch? Facebook? Twitter?

32:06.036 --> 32:07.769
Late-night phone calls
lying on our tummies

32:07.805 --> 32:09.237
with our feet up in the air?

32:09.273 --> 32:10.772
Stewie, I don't think
we can be friends.

32:10.808 --> 32:12.374
You freak me out.

32:12.409 --> 32:14.910
Bart, if we don't keep in touch,
I'll kill myself.

32:14.945 --> 32:16.244
That's what I'm talking about.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.180
Later, dude!

32:18.215 --> 32:20.048
Later...

32:20.083 --> 32:21.817
dude.

32:22.853 --> 32:25.487
Haw-haw!

32:51.152 --> 32:52.885
Aw.

32:54.288 --> 32:55.588
Hey, Griffin.

32:55.623 --> 32:57.757
Sorry about your job.

32:57.792 --> 32:59.692
I was just sticking
up for Duff.

32:59.727 --> 33:00.860
I love Duff.

33:00.895 --> 33:02.395
And Duff loves me.

33:02.430 --> 33:03.829
Duff can keep a secret.

33:03.865 --> 33:05.297
Duff never says no.

33:05.333 --> 33:08.401
Duff is more experimental than
any partner I've ever had.

33:08.436 --> 33:11.771
Anyway, the point
is, I'm sorry.

33:11.806 --> 33:15.041
You know, when I first met you,
I thought, hey, I love this guy!

33:15.076 --> 33:16.809
This is the funniest guy
I've ever met.

33:16.844 --> 33:18.811
I'm gonna quote this guy
to all my friends.

33:18.846 --> 33:20.846
I love his town,
I love his family.

33:20.882 --> 33:23.416
But now, I think
I speak for all of us

33:23.451 --> 33:26.318
when I say,
I am over the Simpsons!

33:26.354 --> 33:28.354
Wh-What
are you saying?

33:28.389 --> 33:30.456
I'm saying
the Simpsons suck!

33:30.491 --> 33:32.191
Why, you...

34:00.121 --> 34:02.555
Ow! What the hell?
That really hurts.

34:02.590 --> 34:05.891
No, it doesn't!
I do it to my son all the time.

34:05.927 --> 34:07.827
You strangle your son?
That's insane!

34:07.862 --> 34:10.996
No wonder he's fat and stupid
and masturbates all the time.

34:11.032 --> 34:12.231
That's <i> your</i> son!

34:43.965 --> 34:45.498
Phew!

34:52.507 --> 34:55.174
Hey! Knock it off!
There's a kid back there!

34:55.208 --> 34:57.743
I'm in danger.

35:37.451 --> 35:40.920
Hey, that's no fair.
I don't got none of them.

35:48.329 --> 35:49.929
Uh-oh.

35:56.437 --> 35:58.404
Hey, hey!

35:58.439 --> 35:59.638
Uh-oh.

36:16.791 --> 36:18.090
Ooh.

36:55.329 --> 36:56.695
Damn it!

37:00.768 --> 37:03.636
And remember, kids,
TV violence is fine

37:03.671 --> 37:06.038
as long as you
don't show a nipple.

37:23.891 --> 37:25.157
Perfect.

37:25.192 --> 37:28.027
The earthlings are
destroying themselves.

37:28.062 --> 37:30.496
Yeah, it's really great,
isn't it, guys?

37:30.531 --> 37:32.498
We went to summer camp together.

37:37.939 --> 37:40.306
Bye! Thanks for having me.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.310
Huh?

37:47.848 --> 37:50.182
It appears that I
am now the only one

37:50.217 --> 37:51.951
with radioactive powers,

37:51.986 --> 37:54.586
which will allow me
to unleash my fury...

37:54.622 --> 37:56.822
Oh, I talked too long.

38:27.488 --> 38:29.755
<i>- We're gonna make it!</i>
<i>- Trust me, we're not.</i>

38:43.804 --> 38:45.104
Huh?
Huh?

38:45.139 --> 38:46.605
Huh?
Huh? Huh?

38:52.613 --> 38:53.746
Whoa!

38:53.781 --> 38:54.913
Whoo-hoo!

38:55.850 --> 38:56.982
Road house.

39:16.037 --> 39:17.736
Aah-aah!

40:16.697 --> 40:19.598
Say hi to Maude Flanders.

40:20.768 --> 40:24.169
No.<i> You</i> say hi
to Muriel Goldman.

40:24.205 --> 40:24.703
Who?

40:55.536 --> 40:57.736
What are you
still doing here?

40:57.771 --> 40:59.671
I think you're gonna get
a kick out of this.

40:59.707 --> 41:01.607
You're parked behind me
at your place.

41:01.642 --> 41:02.741
That <i> is</i> funny.

41:02.776 --> 41:04.076
Hey, listen, I...

41:04.111 --> 41:05.844
I'm sorry we fought.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.480
I just wanted
to make you laugh and cry.

41:08.516 --> 41:10.682
You see, I'm a <i> Family Guy.</i>

41:10.718 --> 41:11.783
I understand.

41:11.819 --> 41:14.019
I'm a <i> The Simpsons.</i>

41:14.054 --> 41:16.655
Look, even if we
don't work as best pals,

41:16.690 --> 41:18.891
I respect you.
You, too.

41:18.926 --> 41:22.327
Let's just agree to stay a half hour
away from each other.

41:22.363 --> 41:25.097
With a pile of
garbage between us.

41:26.600 --> 41:30.102
Worst chicken fight ever.

41:34.074 --> 41:36.401
It sure is nice to
be back in Quahog.

41:36.402 --> 41:39.870
Oh, and thank God all the commotion
about Dad's comic blew over.

41:39.905 --> 41:42.239
Oh, my God, I had a comic?
That's hilarious!

41:42.274 --> 41:44.441
Well, you may not be
a cartoonist anymore,

41:44.477 --> 41:47.144
but you are a local hero
for defending our beer,

41:47.179 --> 41:50.247
and apparently, that's more
important than hating women.

41:50.282 --> 41:53.150
So here you go,
a Pawtucket Patriot Ale.

41:53.185 --> 41:55.786
What? I don't understand.
Ain't the brewery out of business?

41:55.821 --> 41:57.821
We lost a court case.
Yes, we lost,

41:57.857 --> 41:59.590
but how are they
gonna enforce it?

41:59.625 --> 42:01.392
What, are they
gonna come <i> here?</i>

42:01.427 --> 42:03.827
I think we know that's
never gonna happen.

42:03.863 --> 42:06.530
Hey, Stewie, I'm sorry Bart
didn't want to be your friend.

42:06.565 --> 42:08.399
What? No! What are
you talking about?

42:08.434 --> 42:10.167
He was lame.
If you ask me,

42:10.202 --> 42:12.336
he kind of sounded like a girl.
Really?

42:12.371 --> 42:14.071
Kind of seemed like
you idolized him.

42:14.106 --> 42:16.940
And I can understand losing
a friend and feeling rejected.

42:16.976 --> 42:18.475
Course you can!
You're a loser.

42:18.511 --> 42:20.244
But not me.
I'm a lone wolf.

42:20.279 --> 42:22.813
Speaking of which,
I'm gonna go howl at the moon.

42:22.848 --> 42:25.015
Don't need nobody.
