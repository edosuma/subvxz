<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.936 --> 00:04.927
I do remember something
from the accident.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.235
- What did you see?
- Keith.

00:07.307 --> 00:09.070
The boys in Tree Hill are so boring.

00:09.142 --> 00:11.667
Isn't there anybody our age
you think you could fall for?

00:11.745 --> 00:13.007
Maybe.

00:18.084 --> 00:20.450
Hi, I'm Derek.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.216
- I guess I'm your brother.
- Hi, Derek.

00:23.289 --> 00:26.725
Lucas isn't the guy you think he is.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.196
Ellie brought us together.
I want you to have it.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.662
I'm going to find
a really special place for this.

00:32.732 --> 00:35.758
You got it bad, don't you, baby?

00:35.835 --> 00:39.703
It's not Brooke. It's me. I'm pregnant.

00:48.948 --> 00:51.940
Lucas, you know you don't have to come
to every check-up with me.

00:52.018 --> 00:54.009
Its okay, Mom, I want to.

00:55.822 --> 00:59.121
Lucas, why are you coming
to every check-up with me?

01:00.093 --> 01:02.823
- Would Keith be at every check-up?
- Probably, yeah.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.887
Well, then there's your answer.

01:04.964 --> 01:07.956
Karen? We're ready for you.

01:10.737 --> 01:14.070
Go to school, kid.
You're making me nervous.

01:23.450 --> 01:24.974
Peyton?

01:29.089 --> 01:30.989
I'm sorry. I thought you...

01:32.659 --> 01:35.059
That's my friend's jacket.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.696
Take it. Get out.

01:41.401 --> 01:43.198
Who did this to you?

01:45.538 --> 01:48.701
Nobody. I'm just clumsy, that's all.

01:56.149 --> 01:57.377
Hello?

01:58.351 --> 01:59.682
Yes, sir.

02:01.187 --> 02:02.814
A full scholarship.

02:02.889 --> 02:05.881
Yes, sir.
Tell Coach K, I won't let him down.

02:06.159 --> 02:07.490
Thank you.

02:08.094 --> 02:09.186
Yes.

02:09.628 --> 02:10.925
Haley!

02:12.132 --> 02:13.224
What?

02:13.299 --> 02:15.893
- I'm going to Duke.
- I'm pregnant.

02:19.939 --> 02:22.305
It's not Brooke. It's me.

02:23.510 --> 02:24.977
Well, how long have you known?

02:25.044 --> 02:26.773
- A few weeks.
- A few weeks?

02:26.846 --> 02:29.440
I'm sorry. I didn't know how to tell you.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.795
Can you talk to me?
Can you tell me what you're thinking?

02:43.863 --> 02:45.524
Do you still wanna go to Stanford?

02:45.598 --> 02:47.862
- What?
- Stanford. For college.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.095
Yeah, I mean, of course I do, but I don't...

02:53.640 --> 02:54.868
I have to go.

02:55.575 --> 02:57.509
Nathan. Nathan!

02:59.345 --> 03:01.040
I'm pregnant.

03:01.781 --> 03:03.305
We're pregnant.

03:03.816 --> 03:06.011
At least just tell me
how you feel about that?

03:06.085 --> 03:08.918
I feel like you should've told me
a few weeks ago.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.085
That's how I feel.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.097
Hey, Peyton!

03:28.675 --> 03:32.372
- I found your jacket.
- Luke! Oh, my God.

03:33.246 --> 03:36.010
Damn.
I kept a picture of Ellie in here, it's gone.

03:36.082 --> 03:38.448
- That is your jacket, right?
- Yeah, where'd you find it?

03:38.518 --> 03:41.487
Look, does Derek know about
the scar on your leg where you were shot?

03:41.554 --> 03:43.146
Yeah. Why?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.157
- Your jacket was on a girl in the hospital.
- What?

03:45.225 --> 03:48.126
Yeah, she was bleeding in the same place
that you were shot in the leg.

03:48.194 --> 03:52.096
Okay, creepy and weird,
but what does that have to do with Derek?

03:52.165 --> 03:55.032
The other night at Tric,
when he hugged you good night,

03:55.101 --> 03:56.591
he kind of...

03:57.103 --> 03:59.571
- He sniffed your hair.
- Luke, come on!

03:59.639 --> 04:01.106
No, look,
and then your jacket goes missing.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.607
- Stop!
- Ends up on some

04:02.675 --> 04:04.074
hooker in the hospital
wearing a blond wig

04:04.143 --> 04:05.371
- who's dressed like you.
- Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.345
How do you know she was a hooker?

04:07.413 --> 04:10.143
- I don't know. She looked like a hooker.
- Thanks.

04:10.216 --> 04:13.014
Look, I know you're a little bit
jealous of him...

04:13.086 --> 04:15.384
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa,
I'm not jealous of Derek.

04:15.455 --> 04:17.012
Okay. Fine, you're not jealous of him.

04:17.089 --> 04:21.789
So instead of a girl stealing my jacket,
you think Derek stole it,

04:21.861 --> 04:24.489
put it on a woman who may
or may not be a prostitute,

04:24.564 --> 04:27.260
and then stabbed her in the leg.
Is that what you think?

04:27.333 --> 04:29.733
- Honestly, yeah.
- Luke, come on.

04:29.802 --> 04:31.929
This is important to me, okay?

04:32.005 --> 04:34.439
Having a family and having Derek.

04:34.507 --> 04:38.500
He's been nothing but good to me.
So just don't make me doubt him. Please.

04:39.045 --> 04:41.104
I'm just trying to watch out for you,
Peyton.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.648
I know. And I thank you.

04:43.716 --> 04:46.981
But how about you just bodyguard me
to English class?

05:29.829 --> 05:31.797
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:32.465 --> 05:35.161
Well, you said to just come in, so I did.

05:35.802 --> 05:37.292
Thanks for coming.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.697
I know we should be at school,

05:39.906 --> 05:44.104
but I really wanted to talk to you
about the accident.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.550
I feel like we're connected somehow,
Nathan.

05:56.622 --> 05:59.420
Like we're the only two people
on the planet,

05:59.692 --> 06:02.217
you know, trying to understand this.

06:02.462 --> 06:07.161
And, well,
maybe we can help each other through it.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.761
Haley's pregnant.

06:11.270 --> 06:13.204
- You mean Brooke.
- No.

06:13.606 --> 06:16.473
The rumors were wrong. It's Haley.

06:18.578 --> 06:22.070
You know, ten minutes ago,
I was this close to my dream.

06:22.181 --> 06:27.585
For a moment I actually knew exactly
who I was gonna be. And now...

06:29.355 --> 06:31.084
I didn't see Keith.

06:34.260 --> 06:35.887
I'm sorry.

06:37.797 --> 06:41.289
I heard you talking to Peyton
at the party and I just...

06:41.367 --> 06:43.358
All right, I'm an idiot.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.602
That figures.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.572
Nathan.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.935
- You're gonna be okay.
- Sure.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.003
I owe thousands of dollars in hospital bills,

06:55.081 --> 06:58.778
my wife is pregnant and I think
my dead uncle saved my life.

06:59.352 --> 07:03.118
Your parents have money
and your baby's gonna be beautiful.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.123
And maybe your dead uncle saved your life

07:05.191 --> 07:07.716
because you were destined for greatness.

07:10.029 --> 07:11.257
Nathan?

07:15.535 --> 07:19.369
If Haley wasn't pregnant,
did I have a shot?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.202
Not for a second.

07:28.014 --> 07:29.447
Haley.

07:31.317 --> 07:32.545
What's wrong?

07:33.719 --> 07:36.984
I told Nathan that I'm pregnant...

07:38.391 --> 07:40.154
And he walked out.

07:41.527 --> 07:43.154
I'm sorry, buddy.

07:47.166 --> 07:50.101
Listen. Now that Nathan knows,

07:50.169 --> 07:52.296
it wouldn't be horrible exactly

07:52.371 --> 07:56.239
if news of your pregnancy
just somehow sort of slipped out, right?

07:56.309 --> 07:58.402
Well, no, I guess not.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.173
Okay. Great!

08:01.347 --> 08:03.144
Hey, people! Listen up!

08:03.216 --> 08:05.548
I'm not the one who's pregnant, okay?
Haley is!

08:05.618 --> 08:07.916
- Brooke!
- Haley's got the roast on slow cook,

08:07.987 --> 08:10.046
not me! Haley!

08:11.491 --> 08:12.981
Thank you!

08:53.332 --> 08:54.663
Hello?

09:15.388 --> 09:17.754
- It's okay. It's me.
- God! You jackass!

09:17.823 --> 09:19.916
I'm sorry. Okay? I was worried about you.

09:19.992 --> 09:21.687
I wanted to check on the house
before you got home.

09:21.761 --> 09:25.219
Luke, the only one terrorizing me here
is you. Okay?

09:27.199 --> 09:29.895
So, you find anything out of place?

09:30.703 --> 09:32.762
- No. Everything's fine.
- That's right.

09:32.838 --> 09:34.066
Everything's fine.

09:34.140 --> 09:36.665
Other than your brother sniffing your hair.

09:37.543 --> 09:39.943
Okay, well, maybe I saw it wrong.

09:40.613 --> 09:44.071
I'm sorry. Again. I'm going home.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.311
Lucas Scott.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.617
- Thanks for caring.
- You're welcome.

11:09.135 --> 11:11.160
- Hey.
- Hey, perv.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.705
- Did you just IM me?
- No! Why?

11:14.707 --> 11:19.303
Nothing. It's okay. I'll talk to you later.

11:20.312 --> 11:21.540
Okay.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.605
- Lucas Scott.
- Yes, sir.

11:56.682 --> 11:59.742
Detective Wilcox.
We've met before, haven't we?

12:00.553 --> 12:04.751
- Yeah, after the school shooting.
- I thought so.

12:04.824 --> 12:07.952
Listen, they filled me in on this whole
"long-lost brother" scenario.

12:08.027 --> 12:09.756
What else can you give me?

12:10.930 --> 12:13.160
Unfortunately, not much.

12:14.266 --> 12:16.598
Look, I just have a really bad feeling
about this guy

12:16.669 --> 12:19.035
and I'm worried about my friend Peyton.

12:21.006 --> 12:23.440
You carried her out. Peyton Sawyer.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.537
You were the one who carried her
out of the school.

12:26.612 --> 12:28.079
Yeah.

12:29.482 --> 12:30.949
Okay.

12:31.283 --> 12:34.878
- We'll bring him in.
- So you believe me.

12:35.621 --> 12:37.987
You don't think this sounds crazy?

12:38.057 --> 12:40.184
I didn't say it didn't sound crazy.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.354
But that look in your eyes
tells me that you believe it.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.269
- Mr. Scott?
- Haley.

12:57.343 --> 13:00.005
What a surprise. Come on in.

13:00.646 --> 13:02.511
What can I do for you?

13:06.519 --> 13:08.419
I'm just here because

13:08.487 --> 13:11.115
I don't know who else can talk to Nathan.

13:16.695 --> 13:18.026
I'm pregnant.

13:21.333 --> 13:25.667
- Seems to be going around.
- You have to know that

13:25.738 --> 13:29.037
I would never plan something like this
or try and trap him,

13:29.108 --> 13:32.509
especially now that he's got
a scholarship offer to Duke.

13:35.614 --> 13:38.708
Which you didn't know. Sorry.

13:53.365 --> 13:55.959
First of all, congratulations.

13:56.802 --> 14:00.431
Although I am far too young
and handsome to be a grandfather.

14:01.307 --> 14:04.765
And second. Don't worry. It's not healthy.

14:04.877 --> 14:06.401
Have you told Nathan?

14:06.979 --> 14:09.971
- He totally freaked out.
- Been there.

14:10.749 --> 14:14.207
But Haley, it's all gonna be okay.

14:17.556 --> 14:21.014
I'll talk to Nathan. Okay?

14:22.661 --> 14:24.060
Thank you.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.494
Hi, Peyton.

15:51.350 --> 15:53.113
Who let you in here, Peyton?

15:53.185 --> 15:55.813
- Your door was open.
- That's odd.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.578
Yeah.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.225
So, here's the deal.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.285
You know I've really enjoyed
having you around,

16:04.363 --> 16:06.422
but school's gonna be really busy.

16:06.498 --> 16:09.626
So maybe you should just go back
to St. Flora now.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.636
It's Lucas, isn't it?

16:12.905 --> 16:14.429
- He doesn't like me.
- No.

16:14.506 --> 16:18.203
- He's sabotaging our relationship.
- No, Derek.

16:18.277 --> 16:21.576
It's not Lucas. I mean, it's my dad,

16:21.647 --> 16:25.083
he's back from sea now.
So, I have to, I have to spend time...

16:25.150 --> 16:27.710
Look, he's not even your real father!

16:29.655 --> 16:31.316
I'm sorry, Peyton,

16:32.491 --> 16:36.518
I've always imagined
what it'd be like to know you.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.457
You know, to really get inside you.

16:41.367 --> 16:44.734
Now I can never imagine not knowing you.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.435
Not mattering to you.

16:54.980 --> 16:58.472
I matter to you, don't I, Peyton?

17:00.052 --> 17:01.212
Yeah.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.653
More than Lucas?

17:09.228 --> 17:11.093
Goodbye, Derek.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.361
Mom?

17:19.505 --> 17:20.767
Mom?

17:23.809 --> 17:25.174
Nathan.

17:26.111 --> 17:29.478
Is this a friendly visit
or is the DEA outside?

17:29.548 --> 17:34.008
I'm not here to fight with you, Mom.
You have a problem and you know that.

17:35.187 --> 17:39.590
I'm here to tell you that
Duke offered me a scholarship.

17:40.926 --> 17:42.826
Oh, honey.

17:43.328 --> 17:45.421
Oh, congratulations.

17:45.497 --> 17:47.829
I'm so proud of you, Nathan.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.168
Well, there's gonna be
a press conference tonight.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.763
I'll let you know where.
But I really want you to be there, Mom.

17:54.873 --> 17:57.706
- I wouldn't miss it.
- Sober.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.837
I want you to be there sober.

18:02.815 --> 18:06.046
I promise you. I'll be there.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.250
Okay.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.666
Hey. Hey, hey, listen,
don't be pissed at me, okay?

18:28.740 --> 18:30.071
But I talked to the police
and there's definitely...

18:30.142 --> 18:32.440
- Whoa, hey, what's wrong?
- No. You were right.

18:32.511 --> 18:35.503
You were right. Look.
It was in his hotel room.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.006
Okay, what happened?

18:37.082 --> 18:39.073
Nothing, I lied and I said
my dad was waiting,

18:39.151 --> 18:40.641
but I haven't been able to reach him.

18:40.719 --> 18:43.381
It's okay. It's okay.
Look, you can come stay with me.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.581
- All right?
- Okay.

18:44.656 --> 18:46.681
- Let's go get your stuff.
- I'm sorry I doubted you.

18:46.758 --> 18:47.816
It's okay.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.114
For a second there,
I wasn't sure I had the right son.

19:10.182 --> 19:13.413
- What do you want, Dad?
- I just came by to say congratulations.

19:13.485 --> 19:17.251
You're gonna be a father.
Now get up and give the old man a hug.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.495
Oh, it's a wonderful thing, son.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.024
Sort of like getting a full ride from Duke.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.729
- I knew there was a catch.
- Oh, hold on. There's no catch.

19:31.803 --> 19:33.737
I'm thrilled for you and Haley.

19:33.805 --> 19:37.468
But, how long have you loved Haley?
A year?

19:37.543 --> 19:39.943
And you've loved the game
most of your life. You've worked hard,

19:40.012 --> 19:42.742
and Duke recognizes that.
It's a hell of an accomplishment, son.

19:42.814 --> 19:44.577
Haley's dream is to go to Stanford.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.312
Interesting.
I thought her dream was to go on tour.

19:47.386 --> 19:50.219
Oh, wait a minute.
You already let her do that, didn't you?

19:50.289 --> 19:51.847
- Dad.
- Hey, look, I like Haley.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.755
I was wrong about her, okay?

19:54.193 --> 19:57.629
But, if she insists on going to Stanford,
then you gotta let her go.

19:57.696 --> 20:00.221
- Alone.
- She's pregnant.

20:02.067 --> 20:03.659
I understand that.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.896
But if she loves you,
I mean, truly loves you.

20:05.971 --> 20:10.431
Then Haley will put her second dream
behind your first and follow you to Duke.

20:11.543 --> 20:15.309
Hey, I played ball and had you.
You can do it too.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.847
The day I signed
my National Letter of Intent

20:16.915 --> 20:18.382
was the greatest day of my life.

20:18.450 --> 20:19.883
This could be that day for you.

20:19.952 --> 20:23.353
But if Haley takes that away from you,
after you let her go on tour,

20:23.422 --> 20:26.687
then she's not the person
either you and I thought she was.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.218
Think about that.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.566
You understand it now, don't you, son?

20:39.538 --> 20:41.563
I wasn't a monster back then.

20:42.641 --> 20:46.577
I was just a kid chasing his dream
his whole life and finally earned it.

20:47.145 --> 20:48.510
Just like you.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.927
Okay, I know this is a little odd
coming from me,

21:06.999 --> 21:08.626
but don't you think it's a little early?

21:08.700 --> 21:10.065
It's never too early.

21:10.135 --> 21:11.830
Besides, you've been so unhappy lately,

21:11.903 --> 21:15.339
I thought happy hour was the way to go.
Cheers.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.576
So how'd you find this place, anyway?

21:18.644 --> 21:20.771
It's where I met Cooper.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.275
- I'm sorry, Rachel.
- No, it's okay.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.681
I mean, actually, we met on-line first.

21:26.752 --> 21:29.448
I posted some pictures and Cooper replied.

21:29.521 --> 21:32.513
A little lie about my age, some great sex,

21:32.591 --> 21:36.493
a stolen limo, a bridge and a brief
hospital stay later and here we are.

21:36.561 --> 21:40.998
I couldn't do it, the whole
lie-about-my-age-on-the-lnternet thing.

21:41.066 --> 21:43.933
Not to meet a guy. I mean...

21:44.002 --> 21:45.833
You already did.

21:47.339 --> 21:50.433
What? No! No! Rachel!

21:50.509 --> 21:53.842
Just because I am single does not mean
you can pimp me out on-line.

21:53.912 --> 21:57.177
- Is a guy coming here?
- No.

21:59.017 --> 22:01.645
- He's already here.
- What did you...

22:01.720 --> 22:03.278
Okay, he's a part-time model.

22:03.355 --> 22:06.847
You are a 23-year-old
fashion designer named Peyton.

22:06.925 --> 22:08.552
Very funny.

22:09.094 --> 22:10.186
Hi.

22:10.262 --> 22:13.595
Hi. I'm Peyton.

22:14.299 --> 22:16.790
I know. I'm Nick.

22:18.036 --> 22:19.697
I'll be going.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.573
Have fun. Use condoms. Bye.

22:23.642 --> 22:24.700
She's...

22:25.610 --> 22:29.137
Nick, as in Saint Nick?

22:30.515 --> 22:32.210
Not really.

22:37.889 --> 22:39.220
Nathan?

22:42.227 --> 22:43.660
Hi.

22:44.429 --> 22:48.365
Having a press conference
to announce that I'm going to Duke.

22:49.134 --> 22:51.466
I thought we agreed we'd make
that decision together.

22:51.536 --> 22:54.300
Well, plans change, don't they?

22:59.678 --> 23:02.146
You know, everybody's been
congratulating me about the baby

23:02.214 --> 23:04.580
and telling me how wonderful it is,
except you.

23:04.649 --> 23:06.514
A part of me thinks it is wonderful.

23:06.585 --> 23:09.577
- A part of you?
- Haley, what do you want me to say?

23:11.289 --> 23:13.814
I want you to say that,

23:14.459 --> 23:17.826
whatever it is,
we're gonna face it together

23:18.797 --> 23:20.424
and you've never been so happy.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.194
And everything's gonna be okay.

23:22.267 --> 23:24.098
Haley, I don't wanna lie to you.

23:24.169 --> 23:26.637
This whole thing scares me to death.

23:30.709 --> 23:32.108
Look,

23:34.713 --> 23:36.305
do you wanna come with me?

23:36.381 --> 23:38.815
- To Duke?
- To the press conference.

23:38.884 --> 23:42.320
I can't. I can't do that right now.

23:43.622 --> 23:45.886
My dad said you would say that.

23:50.162 --> 23:51.493
You know what, Nathan.

23:51.563 --> 23:54.657
It is really not about
what schools we go to

23:54.733 --> 23:57.566
or what dreams we have.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.671
Because whatever you want,
I want that for you.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.573
I just really thought
that the news of your child

24:05.644 --> 24:09.375
would affect you more than
the news of a scholarship.

24:12.784 --> 24:17.483
I'm not gonna feel guilty about this.
I'm not.

24:29.334 --> 24:30.892
Can you believe this?

24:30.969 --> 24:33.802
Derek. Is it any wonder
I have commitment issues?

24:33.939 --> 24:37.170
Yep. You're pretty much
the Bermuda Triangle of relationships.

24:37.542 --> 24:38.531
Thanks.

24:40.745 --> 24:43.407
- Crap. Turn around.
- What?

24:43.482 --> 24:46.042
Just turn around. I have to change.

24:47.586 --> 24:51.249
You know, I can't believe what a creep
he turned out to be. You know?

24:51.323 --> 24:54.019
And I just let him waltz into my house.

24:54.092 --> 24:57.425
Like, "Hey, I'm a crazy psycho,
can I come in?" And then, I'm all like,

24:57.496 --> 24:59.327
"Yeah sure. You wanna see my bedroom?"

24:59.397 --> 25:00.830
- Peyton.
- And he's still out there.

25:00.899 --> 25:03.459
Oh, God, they'll find him, okay?

25:03.535 --> 25:06.231
All right? The detectives,
they said they'd call when they do,

25:06.304 --> 25:07.999
and then we'll finally have some answers.

25:08.073 --> 25:11.668
Until then, you're safe with me. I promise.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.771
You're always saving me.

25:16.815 --> 25:19.079
Okay, you can turn around.

25:19.885 --> 25:23.787
Whoa!
Is this your way of saying thank you?

25:23.855 --> 25:27.484
Nice try. A few of the cheerleaders
have to be at Nathan's press conference.

25:27.559 --> 25:30.187
Oh. Wow. I forgot about that.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.423
Wouldn't you be safer
just to avoid the whole thing?

25:32.497 --> 25:34.965
No. I'm not gonna hide out
because of Derek. No way.

25:35.033 --> 25:38.230
Well, actually I meant because
Brooke might be there.

26:10.302 --> 26:13.271
Welcome to my history,
Haley James Scott.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.480
- Hello.
<i>- Lucas, it's Detective Wilcox.</i>

26:28.853 --> 26:31.686
<i>- We picked up Derek.</i>
- They got him.

26:31.756 --> 26:35.123
Could you come down to the station?
I'd like you to give a formal statement.

26:35.193 --> 26:38.754
Sure, I'm on my way.

26:41.132 --> 26:43.259
They want me to go to the station.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.902
- Should I go too?
- No, you know what, I don't think so.

26:47.973 --> 26:50.441
- Would you apologize to Nathan for me?
- Yeah.

26:50.508 --> 26:51.805
Okay. I'll call you.

26:51.876 --> 26:54.538
Why don't you just come by my house
when you're done?

26:54.613 --> 26:55.978
All right.

26:58.216 --> 26:59.478
Thank you.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.728
You all right?

27:21.039 --> 27:23.337
No wife. No mom.

27:23.408 --> 27:25.808
Just lying bitches like me.

27:27.112 --> 27:29.774
I really wanted to help you, Nathan.

27:29.848 --> 27:34.148
And most of the time
that means sex in my world.

27:34.953 --> 27:37.444
But that wasn't fair to you and Haley.

27:37.789 --> 27:42.089
Plus there's all this Cooper stuff
that's gonna take years of therapy.

27:45.463 --> 27:47.021
How's Haley doing?

27:47.098 --> 27:50.363
She hasn't said it,
but I think she's as scared as I am.

27:50.435 --> 27:53.734
She shouldn't be. Unlike the rest of us,

27:54.539 --> 27:58.270
this baby's gonna have two
pretty great parents.

28:00.745 --> 28:02.007
Good luck.

28:17.462 --> 28:20.397
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to City Hall.

28:20.465 --> 28:22.524
It's my pleasure to host
this press conference,

28:22.600 --> 28:24.227
not just as your Mayor,

28:24.969 --> 28:27.301
but as an awfully proud father.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.237
And now without further ado, I'd like to

28:29.307 --> 28:35.405
<i>present a young man with an enormously</i>
<i>bright future, my son, Nathan Scott.</i>

28:47.158 --> 28:48.887
Greatest day of your life.

28:54.666 --> 28:57.794
As many of you know,
I called this press conference today

28:57.869 --> 29:00.531
to announce where I plan
to play basketball in college.

29:00.605 --> 29:03.267
I've had a lot of great offers,
but it's always been my dream

29:03.341 --> 29:05.104
to play at Duke University.

29:13.985 --> 29:17.512
So, that's where I plan to go.

29:25.363 --> 29:26.523
But...

29:28.700 --> 29:34.195
You know, my father said that today
would be the greatest day of my life.

29:34.272 --> 29:39.141
And you're right, Dad. It is.
But it's not because of basketball.

29:39.210 --> 29:43.613
You see, today I learned that my wife,
Haley, is pregnant.

29:45.850 --> 29:49.650
And while it's an absolute honor
to be recruited by Duke University,

29:49.721 --> 29:52.690
I guess what I have to say to you
today is this.

29:53.691 --> 29:57.627
Where I play basketball,
if I play basketball,

29:57.695 --> 30:00.596
is no longer a decision
for me to make alone.

30:00.698 --> 30:03.064
It's a decision that I'll make with my wife

30:03.134 --> 30:05.830
<i>and my family's best interest at heart.</i>

30:05.904 --> 30:08.065
<i>And when I do, I'll let you all know.</i>

30:08.139 --> 30:13.634
<i>And my wife couldn't be here today,</i>
<i>so I just wanted to say one thing to her.</i>

30:13.711 --> 30:18.876
Haley, no matter what happens,
we'll face it together.

30:18.950 --> 30:22.351
But I promise you, I've never been happier.

30:22.420 --> 30:25.355
Everything's gonna be okay. I love you.

30:25.423 --> 30:28.324
- I love you, too.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

31:02.160 --> 31:04.651
It's all in your head.

31:07.665 --> 31:09.633
So, are you enjoying the tour?

31:09.701 --> 31:11.601
Almost as much as the handholding.

31:11.669 --> 31:14.729
Oh, good. We'll continue both.

31:14.806 --> 31:17.331
This is Tree Hill High where I...

31:17.976 --> 31:20.604
used to be a cheerleader. Like, years ago.

31:20.678 --> 31:21.770
A cheerleader.

31:21.846 --> 31:26.283
Nice.
Any chance you still have your uniform?

31:27.085 --> 31:29.679
You know, I think there's a pretty
good chance I do.

31:29.754 --> 31:31.949
Oh. Excellent.

31:32.056 --> 31:34.115
What were you like in high school?

31:34.192 --> 31:37.628
Horny. Mostly for cheerleaders.

31:38.396 --> 31:42.890
Well! Maybe we should get you back
to high school. Come on.

31:47.538 --> 31:49.972
You ought to be proud of Nathan today,

31:50.041 --> 31:54.171
putting his dreams on hold
so history wouldn't repeat itself.

31:55.380 --> 31:58.315
- He acted like a child.
- No, Danny.

31:58.816 --> 32:01.410
He acted like a man.

32:06.891 --> 32:09.451
I didn't know you were a religious person.

32:10.628 --> 32:12.687
Genesis 4:10.

32:26.577 --> 32:29.102
That number you gave us
led us right to him.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.044
Yeah, I'm just glad he's not out there.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.477
That's not him.

32:36.921 --> 32:40.584
Son, that's Derek Sommers
from St. Flora, North Carolina.

32:40.658 --> 32:44.059
Same phone number as the one
in the letter you gave us.

32:45.396 --> 32:49.355
That's not him. Peyton.

32:51.235 --> 32:53.135
<i>He's free to go.</i>

33:02.280 --> 33:04.077
- Hey.
- They got the wrong guy!

33:04.148 --> 33:05.911
- What?
- Derek! He's still out there.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.417
Don't go home!

33:14.225 --> 33:16.284
Hey, Lucas, I gotta go. I just got home

33:16.361 --> 33:20.058
and my dad's waiting for me,
plus Derek's here.

33:20.131 --> 33:22.429
No-no-no-no! Wait! Didn't you hear me?

33:24.335 --> 33:28.135
- Hey, Derek.
- Peyton?

33:29.607 --> 33:32.337
- Peyton!
- Hey. Hey, I wanna talk to you.

33:32.410 --> 33:35.072
Hey? Hey!

33:35.213 --> 33:36.680
Hey!

33:40.985 --> 33:43.044
Look, you know what,
I told you my dad's home now.

33:43.121 --> 33:45.316
No, he's not.

33:49.594 --> 33:51.289
I locked it.

33:52.830 --> 33:55.958
Peyton. Peyton!

33:58.036 --> 34:00.596
Don't you know how much I love you?

34:00.805 --> 34:03.933
Oh, God. Look, look, Derek...

34:12.583 --> 34:15.518
That wasn't very nice, Peyton.

34:15.585 --> 34:18.953
You better get out of here,
I'm calling the cops!

34:19.123 --> 34:21.056
I don't think so.

34:21.125 --> 34:23.992
You see, you dropped
your cell phone on the porch

34:24.062 --> 34:27.589
and the home line, well, it's dead.

34:28.866 --> 34:30.697
Leave me alone!

34:43.380 --> 34:45.076
Oh, God!

35:21.052 --> 35:24.283
Don't you know
we're supposed to be together?

35:59.557 --> 36:01.616
Don't cry, Peyton.

36:01.692 --> 36:03.922
I'm here now.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.826
I came here for you.

36:18.543 --> 36:20.272
Run, Peyton!

36:24.415 --> 36:25.939
Lucas!

36:29.253 --> 36:30.686
Lucas!

36:33.291 --> 36:34.519
No!

36:42.800 --> 36:44.131
Stop!

36:54.245 --> 36:57.874
I watched you, Peyton. I listened to you.

36:58.683 --> 37:02.619
Everything that you showed me
on your webcam.

37:02.687 --> 37:05.212
The things that you
shared with me on-line.

37:05.389 --> 37:09.155
You were talking to me. I know you were...

37:24.909 --> 37:26.809
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm her brother, bitch!

37:26.877 --> 37:28.742
Who the hell are you?

37:39.624 --> 37:42.650
It's been real good meeting you.

37:44.462 --> 37:47.431
But there's only room
for one guy in Peyton's life.

37:49.867 --> 37:51.232
No way.

38:15.426 --> 38:19.624
Hey. Hey. It's okay. I'm here. It's okay.

38:20.531 --> 38:22.192
Who are you?

38:23.267 --> 38:25.326
I guess I'm your brother.

38:40.184 --> 38:42.448
"And he said, what hast thou done?

38:42.520 --> 38:46.786
"The voice of thy brother's blood
crieth unto me from the ground."

38:59.670 --> 39:01.035
You sure about this?

39:01.105 --> 39:03.300
I mean, other than a few e-mails,
we don't even know each other.

39:03.374 --> 39:05.842
I know. That's half the fun.

39:39.243 --> 39:40.437
Hey, you.

39:42.146 --> 39:44.080
Sorry. I've gotta go.

39:44.148 --> 39:47.345
- But you can probably find your way out.
- I wanna call you.

39:47.418 --> 39:49.249
Can I have your number?

39:50.054 --> 39:51.248
No.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.588
But you can e-mail me.

40:16.347 --> 40:20.215
You know, I thought it was a miracle
that I survived that accident

40:20.951 --> 40:23.943
and I guess I never really felt worthy of it.

40:25.189 --> 40:28.158
But now I know that miracle
wasn't for me.

40:28.225 --> 40:29.988
It was for us.

40:30.861 --> 40:32.453
All three of us.

40:46.877 --> 40:48.674
What are you doing in here?

40:51.882 --> 40:55.511
I was just making sure
I'm prepared for my first day.

40:59.657 --> 41:02.421
Relax, Nick. You're a great teacher.

41:02.493 --> 41:05.656
I have a feeling the students
are gonna love you.

41:15.739 --> 41:17.036
Police!

41:17.708 --> 41:20.268
It's okay. I live here.

41:20.344 --> 41:22.209
He's right out here.

41:30.054 --> 41:31.316
Where?

42:17.434 --> 42:18.423
English

42:19.305 --> 42:25.784
