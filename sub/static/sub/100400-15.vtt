WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.212
Cooper: 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:13.555 --> 00:14.848
No. Victoria.
Yeah.

00:14.848 --> 00:15.807
Fuh‐lap ball change,

00:15.807 --> 00:17.226
fuh‐lap ball change.

00:17.226 --> 00:18.852
Fuh‐lap ball change,
fuh‐lap ball...

00:18.852 --> 00:19.853
Hey. What, uh ‐‐
Yeah?

00:19.853 --> 00:20.604
What's going on?
Nothing.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.105
What's ‐‐

00:22.105 --> 00:23.315
Okay, here. Come on,
let's ‐‐ let's take a walk.

00:23.315 --> 00:24.358
You guys run that again.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.360
Come here.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.819
I'm sorry, Cooper.
I'm sorry.

00:27.819 --> 00:28.820
For what?

00:28.820 --> 00:29.988
I'm sorry for ‐‐

00:29.988 --> 00:31.406
For crying at rehearsal.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.700
Never apologize
for your emotional life.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.369
Alright?

00:35.369 --> 00:37.287
Your emotional life is why
I cast you in every lead.

00:37.287 --> 00:40.916
Your emotional life is what
makes you impossible to ignore.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.042
Apologize for
those fuh‐lap ball changes ‐‐

00:42.042 --> 00:43.085
they're atrocious.

00:45.796 --> 00:48.257
What's ‐‐
What's going on?

00:50.008 --> 00:52.344
My grandma died.

00:56.098 --> 00:57.266
My ‐‐ My grandma died,

00:57.266 --> 00:59.893
and my parents
just went back to work,

00:59.893 --> 01:04.022
so ‐‐ I don't know ‐‐
I figured I'd come ‐‐

01:04.022 --> 01:06.066
I'd just come to rehearsal,
but I, um...

01:06.066 --> 01:08.485
I just ‐‐
Oh, my love.

01:09.653 --> 01:12.948
Your soul is large.
Right?

01:12.948 --> 01:16.285
Your being
contains multitudes.

01:16.285 --> 01:19.162
You can be sad for Grandma
and fuh‐lap ball change

01:19.162 --> 01:21.248
all at the same time.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.499
Alright?

01:24.543 --> 01:25.836
Come on, you got this.

01:25.836 --> 01:26.878
Come on.
Yeah.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.297
You got it.
You got it.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.340
Alright, guys,
let's take that again, okay?

01:30.340 --> 01:32.467
Deep breath.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.468
Here we go.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.345
5, 6, 7, 8.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.265
But, I mean, really,

01:38.265 --> 01:40.601
how do you get a hairbrush
stuck in your ‐‐

01:42.060 --> 01:43.895
I ‐‐ I ‐‐ It...

01:43.895 --> 01:45.689
Hey, Jackson.
I didn't see you.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.232
Hairbrush stuck in your, uh,
what now?

01:47.232 --> 01:48.567
Uh, it's nothing. It's ‐‐
Vagina.

01:48.567 --> 01:49.985
Yeah.
We had a walk‐in today ‐‐

01:49.985 --> 01:51.653
hobble‐in, actually.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.947
Woman got a hairbrush stuck
in her vagina.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.324
Let me ‐‐ Let ‐‐
Let me guess.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.075
She, uh ‐‐
She fell on it.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.410
Yeah.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.662
Oh, they always ‐‐ always say
they fell on it.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.497
Hey, yo, Bishop ‐‐
Avery and I are on the PRT,

02:02.497 --> 02:04.458
but Flores's kid
has the flu.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.500
You want me to
call Christy in?

02:05.500 --> 02:06.710
Yeah, but she lives
an hour away.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.294
I can run anesthesia,
but we need a driver,

02:08.294 --> 02:10.255
so, can you pull someone
from B‐shift, or...?

02:10.255 --> 02:11.798
You can have probie.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.217
What?
No, I just finished 24 hours.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.469
You rode the desk
all shift.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.553
You're nice and rested.
Warren, he's all yours.

02:18.180 --> 02:22.225
Engine 19, Ladder 19,
Aid Car 19, and PRT 19

02:22.225 --> 02:23.560
requested to MVC.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.646
Oh, and, probie,
green means go.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.105
 Let's move.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.941
Oh, my God.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.861
You slept with him,
didn't you?

02:32.861 --> 02:33.862
What?
You slept with him.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.364
No. Nope.

02:35.364 --> 02:36.573
I'm just disappointed
I didn't notice it sooner.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.408
Uh, I'm sorry.
Because we're both gay men...
I ‐‐

02:38.408 --> 02:39.284
...you just assume
that we slept together?

02:39.284 --> 02:41.161
Oh, no, it's because
you guys avoid eye contact

02:41.161 --> 02:42.287
with each other
like it's your job.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.747
No, I didn't, okay?
You ‐‐ Oh.

02:43.747 --> 02:44.873
He's got a whole ‐‐
Okay.

02:44.873 --> 02:45.832
He's got a whole what?

02:45.832 --> 02:46.875
He just broke up with his ‐‐

02:46.875 --> 02:47.834
Okay, fine.
Yes, I did.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.044
Shut up, shut up!
Yes! I knew it!

02:49.044 --> 02:50.003
Oh, my God.
No. What about you?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.129
What about you?
I knew it!

02:51.129 --> 02:52.589
"Oh, Jackson,
I didn't see you there."

02:52.589 --> 02:53.674
Don't ‐‐

02:53.674 --> 02:55.008
I may have done
something bad.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.051
What ‐‐

02:56.051 --> 02:57.386
Jackson?
No.

02:57.386 --> 02:58.387
Well...

02:58.387 --> 03:01.306
Ugh.
Jackson?

03:01.306 --> 03:03.642
Why do we sleep
with the people we work with?

03:03.642 --> 03:05.894
Well, the only people we ever
meet are people we work with.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.437
Montgomery. Hughes.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.731
The Chief's office sent over
some addresses of inspections

03:09.731 --> 03:12.526
that they need fast‐tracked ‐‐
today.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.819
Who wants some overtime?

03:13.819 --> 03:15.195
So, is this just how
it's gonna be now?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.155
The Battalion Chief wants to
spend time with his wife,

03:17.155 --> 03:19.616
so just the underlings have to
work on their day off?

03:19.616 --> 03:20.742
Yep.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.285
Got it. Okay. Hey.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.829
Okay, w‐why ‐‐ why is
the Chief's office asking us

03:23.829 --> 03:25.205
to do the inspections?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.456
Fire Marshal's backed up.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.208
These are priority.
We'll get them.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.501
But we just finished
a shift.
No.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.837
Okay, knocking down fires
gets all the glory,

03:31.837 --> 03:33.797
but inspections
are the real life‐savers.

03:33.797 --> 03:34.881
Plus, we like money.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.008
Thank you.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.593
Why do we befriend people
we work with?

03:38.593 --> 03:40.637
Because the only people we meet
are people we work with.

03:40.637 --> 03:41.555
Hey.
You love me!

03:41.555 --> 03:42.431
No!
Let's go!

03:42.431 --> 03:43.849
Stop it!
Let's ‐‐

03:43.849 --> 03:45.434
I told you so many times
I don't like that.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.602
Hey. You want to grab breakfast
or something?

03:47.602 --> 03:48.895
No, I can't.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.148
I‐I promised Robert
I'd go through my dad's stuff.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.108
It's ‐‐ It's taking over
his apartment.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.818
You mean, your apartment that
you guys live in together?

03:54.818 --> 03:58.113
Alright, Gibson, I don't need
your...whatever that is.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.117
Hey. What do you
got going on today?

04:02.117 --> 04:03.326
I am weirdly free.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.453
I have the nanny
until 3:00.

04:04.453 --> 04:05.704
You gonna hang out
with Sasha?

04:05.704 --> 04:07.581
Oh, I don't think
we're daytime date‐ready yet.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.167
Oh. Okay.
Batting cages.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.210
Help. I'm s‐sorry.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.670
Ma'am?
I need help.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.046
Okay. Okay.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.130
Are you hurt?

04:16.130 --> 04:18.466
No.
I ‐‐ I need help.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.676
Alright.

04:19.676 --> 04:20.886
He's down.
H‐He's not moving.

04:20.886 --> 04:21.928
Who?

04:21.928 --> 04:22.888
Who?
Who's not moving?

04:22.888 --> 04:24.222
H‐He's at the park.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.432
Whoa, whoa.
Uh, Humboldt Park?

04:25.432 --> 04:26.933
Y‐Yeah. I‐I think so.
Yeah, yeah. I think.

04:26.933 --> 04:27.893
Okay.
Alright, come with us.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.311
Alright?
Yeah.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.395
Just, uh, come this way,

04:30.395 --> 04:32.230
and we'll get you
checked out, okay?

04:32.230 --> 04:33.774
Here, here.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.111
Alright, okay, okay.
Hey, hey, hey.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.988
Can you tell us
what happened?

04:39.988 --> 04:42.365
I think I killed him.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.201
I really think
I killed him.

04:47.496 --> 04:48.872
Do you think
she's an invol?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.585
Hey, hey.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.628
Can you tell us your name?

04:54.628 --> 04:57.297
Um, Darcie.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.381
Darcie.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.343
Reported victim of an assault
at Humboldt Park.

05:01.343 --> 05:02.928
Police should be here
in a minute.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.513
Uh, PRT wasn't needed
at the MVC.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.181
They're still near the park,
so they're on their way now.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.058
Darcie.
It's gonna be okay.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.351
When the police get here,
just tell them what happened.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.310
Okay.
You should be alright.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.686
But what should I do
about this?

05:11.686 --> 05:13.188
‐Whoa, whoa, whoa, um...
‐Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.064
Okay.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.776
Physician Response Team,
Station 19.

05:17.776 --> 05:18.944
He's got a pulse.

05:18.944 --> 05:22.197
Barely.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.907
And he's losing
a ton of blood here.

05:23.907 --> 05:24.991
Okay, let's get him
flipped over.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.869
Let's move him.
Dixon.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.204
On my count. Ready?

05:29.204 --> 05:30.455
1, 2, 3.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.666
Yeah.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.708
Yeah.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.336
That's bad.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.974
He has free fluid
in his abdomen.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.185
This is PRT 19.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.728
We have a 30‐year‐old man

05:53.728 --> 05:55.772
with multiple stab wounds
to his abdomen,

05:55.772 --> 05:57.399
unresponsive
and hypotensive.

05:57.399 --> 06:00.151
At least 40%
of blood volume lost.

06:00.151 --> 06:03.697
Copy. Let us know
if you need an aid car.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.823
Hey, Dixon, get in the cab
and make sure

06:04.823 --> 06:05.699
you know the route
to Grey‐Sloan.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.659
Alright. Copy.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.369
Damn it,
his pressure keeps dropping.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.371
Alright, well,
you know what that means.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.956
The only way for him to survive
is if we open him up

06:12.956 --> 06:14.249
right here and now.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.542
You're a fast learner.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.802
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, what are you doing?

06:25.802 --> 06:26.636
You can't be in ‐‐

06:26.636 --> 06:28.305
Drive.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.390
...here.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.443
I don't see any bowel
or mesentery lacs.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.903
We got to find out where
this blood is coming from.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.195
He's going into shock.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.740
Hey, let's ‐‐
let's start packing him.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.534
Grey‐Sloan,
this is PRT 19.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.744
Have an OR ready.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.746
We are coming in hot
with our stabbing victim.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.122
I said drive.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.707
 Copy, PRT 19.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.125
We'll prep an OR.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.835
Whoa.

06:58.835 --> 06:59.753
Hey!

06:59.753 --> 07:01.004
What the hell?!

07:02.422 --> 07:04.049
Damn it!

07:04.049 --> 07:05.091
Hey, probie!

07:05.091 --> 07:06.092
Stop!

07:06.092 --> 07:07.344
Do not slow down.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.346
Well, I ‐‐
I have to slow down,

07:09.346 --> 07:10.347
or they'll know
something's wrong,

07:10.347 --> 07:11.848
and they'll call the police.
Probie!

07:11.848 --> 07:12.807
Fine, but do not stop.
Hey, stop!

07:12.807 --> 07:13.892
Okay. Just ‐‐ I ‐‐

07:13.892 --> 07:15.727
What are ‐‐
What are you doing?!

07:18.605 --> 07:19.898
Sorry, guys.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.066
I ‐‐ I thought you wanted me
to drive.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.443
I'm just looking
for a safe place to stop.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.793
Come on.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.461
Just do one box
at a time.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.634
Okay.
Here we go.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.220
Oh, my God.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.513
Wow.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.348
He saved everything.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.350
"Happy 5th Birthday, Andy.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.102
You're the best
sister‐cousin ever."

07:57.102 --> 07:57.977
Who is that from?

07:57.977 --> 07:59.229
Let me ‐‐

07:59.229 --> 08:00.897
Oh, my God,
my cousin Michelle.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.400
We were inseparable.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.526
We used to call each other
sisters.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.528
Where is she now?

08:06.528 --> 08:09.656
I don't know. I...

08:09.656 --> 08:10.699
That's so weird.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.826
I haven't thought of her
in years.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.328
Mm.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.330
Tía Sandra, Tío Johnny!

08:17.330 --> 08:19.708
T‐That's my mother's sister
and her husband.
Uh‐huh.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.209
This is so crazy.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.795
I haven't seen them
since...

08:25.380 --> 08:27.799
What?

08:27.799 --> 08:29.217
Since my mom died.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.514
Sir, we're from
the Seattle Fire Department.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.474
We're here
for the inspection.

08:36.474 --> 08:37.976
Sorry, what inspection?

08:37.976 --> 08:39.184
Fire code inspection.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.352
Standard practice
for all new business permitting.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.230
No, we were told the permits
were already handled.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.148
By who?

08:43.148 --> 08:44.607
By the person who told me.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.276
Which is...?

08:46.276 --> 08:48.278
None of your business.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.195
‐Mm.
‐Okay, you know what, sir?

08:49.195 --> 08:51.156
We are here from
the Fire Department,

08:51.156 --> 08:54.200
and our job is to inspect your
premises for any issues, so...

08:54.200 --> 08:57.245
Y‐Your job is
to listen to your boss, right?

08:57.245 --> 08:58.955
Yeah, our boss is
who sent us here.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.875
Well, his boss is my friend
Fire Chief Dixon.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.044
So you can take it up
with him.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.105
Oh, no, no, no.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.065
Sorry, that's a "C."
Can we start again?

09:25.065 --> 09:26.441
Victoria.
Yep?

09:26.441 --> 09:28.902
I'm the director.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.278
Start again.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.572
Okay.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.666
Stop. Stop.
Let's take 5.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.294
Fire inspections take a lot
longer than 5 minutes.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.337
Oh, my God.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.838
Fire inspection?
For what?

09:48.838 --> 09:50.381
For fire.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.008
Every single show,
you people do this,

09:52.008 --> 09:53.676
and every single show,

09:53.676 --> 09:56.638
it's a huge waste
of time and money.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.432
Fine. The city of Seattle
thanks you for protecting them

09:59.432 --> 10:02.477
from the big, bad community
college drama students.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.737
I was running, and then,
he appeared all of a sudden.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.405
 Who did?

10:14.405 --> 10:16.825
He jumped out,
maybe behind the bushes.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.076
I‐I don't know.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.537
Darcie,
who jumped out at you?

10:20.537 --> 10:22.205
The guy.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.290
H‐He grabbed me
by my ponytail.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.416
Attempted assault.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.211
And h‐he tried to drag me
into the bushes.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.380
Assault, not attempted.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.423
Am I gonna go to jail?

10:32.423 --> 10:34.634
We're gonna get you
a medical exam, Darcie.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.594
She needs a psych eval
before you question her further.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.263
Can you guys take her
to Grey‐Sloan?

10:38.263 --> 10:40.056
Yeah, uh, we'll take her.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.516
You're off‐duty.

10:41.516 --> 10:42.559
You're short‐staffed.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.686
I'm gonna ride
with her.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.062
Come on, sweetie.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.314
It's okay.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.274
I'm gonna kill this kid
when we stop.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.651
We got to figure out
where the hell

10:51.651 --> 10:53.027
this bleeding's
coming from ‐‐ now.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.029
Okay, you know what? Let ‐‐
Let's go quadrant by quadrant.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.156
Alright, good call.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.579
Okay.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.914
It doesn't ‐‐ doesn't look like
it's coming from the spleen.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.332
Okay.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.417
Uh ‐‐

11:07.417 --> 11:08.543
Oh, there! There!
There, there, there.

11:08.543 --> 11:09.752
What do you got?

11:09.752 --> 11:11.087
Uh, it's
the retrohepatic IVC.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.338
I feel the defect,

11:12.338 --> 11:16.217
and I am holding
pinpoint pressure...now.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.302
It's got to be the posterior
stab wound, yeah?

11:17.302 --> 11:18.595
Oh!

11:18.595 --> 11:20.180
What the hell?!

11:22.265 --> 11:23.683
Probie, I don't care
if the Chief is your dad ‐‐

11:23.683 --> 11:25.727
I'm gonna ‐‐

11:25.727 --> 11:28.146
I want all the painkillers on
this truck, or I kill this kid.

11:40.074 --> 11:43.578
‐
‐

11:43.578 --> 11:45.205
Oh, is it just me, or are
orgasms better in the daylight?

11:46.623 --> 11:48.208
It isn't just you.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.252
I actually did a whole study
on female orgasms.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.795
Oh, that's a study
I'd like to see.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.674
How do you feel?

11:56.674 --> 11:57.926
Right now?

11:57.926 --> 11:59.636
Amazing.

11:59.636 --> 12:03.640
I mean about your mama.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.392
I haven't talked to her
since the spaghetti dinner.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.603
Don't you think
you should try?

12:08.603 --> 12:09.812
Why?

12:09.812 --> 12:14.651
Because she's your mom,
and she's hurting, and...

12:14.651 --> 12:16.861
Yeah,
that's not my problem.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.530
If she wants to ruin her life
and live in a motel forever

12:19.530 --> 12:22.367
because of some raised voices,
that's her choice.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.661
I get it, that this
is hard for you, Maya,

12:24.661 --> 12:27.205
but don't you think maybe
there is some truth

12:27.205 --> 12:28.206
in what
your mom says ‐‐

12:28.206 --> 12:29.832
Stop.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.751
Please.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.419
Mm.

12:36.714 --> 12:39.008
Listen to this ‐‐
from 20 years ago.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.302
January 24, 2000 ‐‐

12:41.302 --> 12:44.389
"Michelle is asking to play
with her sister‐cousin.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.515
I am at a loss.

12:45.515 --> 12:46.933
What do I tell her?

12:46.933 --> 12:49.352
I just don't understand."

12:49.352 --> 12:52.063
This was from my Aunt Sandra
right after my mom died.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.357
What ‐‐ What doesn't
she understand?
Mm.

12:54.357 --> 12:57.777
You know, families drift apart
when ‐‐ when people die.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.406
Yeah, okay, but this ‐‐
this seems like a ‐‐

13:01.406 --> 13:04.200
like an excommunication,
like my dad cut Sandra off.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.702
Well, do you remember
that happening?

13:05.702 --> 13:07.662
No, I don't remember
any of this.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.831
I mean, I don't remember a lot
from when she died,

13:09.831 --> 13:13.710
but something is off.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.963
When my parents died...

13:16.963 --> 13:19.299
it was too painful
for a lot of people.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.925
You know, nobody knew
what to say to me,

13:20.925 --> 13:22.093
not even my own family.

13:22.093 --> 13:26.639
They ‐‐ They just slowly
drifted away.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.850
It happens.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.393
Maybe your aunt
just didn't know

13:30.393 --> 13:33.313
how to handle the fact
that her sister was gone,

13:33.313 --> 13:36.733
and seeing you
was a reminder.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.444
Okay, well,
if that's true, that ‐‐

13:39.444 --> 13:40.737
that sucks.

13:40.737 --> 13:41.821
It does.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.745
I got to go.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.748
Are you gonna be alright?

14:08.806 --> 14:11.350
I thought I was safe.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.812
Jogging in the middle
of the day.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.689
You hear about women
getting raped in parks,

14:16.689 --> 14:18.524
and it's like, well, duh.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.027
Why would you go running
at night in a park?

14:21.027 --> 14:23.029
Like, it's their fault.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.322
Darcie...

14:28.242 --> 14:31.079
My mom gave me that pocket knife
when I moved to the city.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.916
I swear,
I never thought I'd use it.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.797
You shouldn't have to.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.139
It's temporary.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.265
I don't care
if it's temporary ‐‐

14:51.265 --> 14:52.975
it's blocking
your fire exit.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.894
Okay, but all you have to do
is go around and ‐‐

14:54.894 --> 14:56.771
Alright.

14:56.771 --> 14:59.357
I want you to imagine that
there's a fire coming at you.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.818
The air is filled
with smoke.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.444
Try finding a way out then.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.321
That is what the fire curtain
is for.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.906
Does your fire curtain work?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.741
We will fix the set.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.576
And the fire curtain.
Fine.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.453
Now, you are cutting into
my rehearsal time,

15:12.453 --> 15:14.580
and you are leaning on my piano,
which, frankly,

15:14.580 --> 15:16.874
costs more than your entire
insurance policy.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.292
So, if you please...

15:18.292 --> 15:20.253
Save me two tickets.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.379
Good seats.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.255
Please.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.631
I'll see what I can do.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.049
Victoria.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.300
I really hope
this isn't something

15:26.300 --> 15:27.718
I could have done
over the phone.

15:27.718 --> 15:30.221
No, you need to go
and talk to that asshat owner.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.389
Yeah, he think he's above
getting inspections

15:31.389 --> 15:32.890
'cause he's friends
with Dixon.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.684
He said
it was "handled."

15:37.562 --> 15:39.397
I see the problem here.
I was mistaken.

15:39.397 --> 15:40.690
These were already approved.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.358
I just needed to sign them
to fast‐track them.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.901
No, sir,
I seriously doubt that.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.653
I can see, like, four major
fire hazards from here.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.155
Well, I'm sure they're gonna
take care of them.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.072
They said
they weren't going to.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.699
It's done, Hughes.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.078
Go home.

16:01.836 --> 16:04.672
How long are you going to
angry‐chop at me?

16:04.672 --> 16:07.049
I'm just chopping.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.844
You know,
my dad has bipolar I?

16:09.844 --> 16:11.971
You said that.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.682
And my
sweet baby brother

16:14.682 --> 16:17.143
has inherited it.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.853
I ‐‐

16:18.853 --> 16:20.688
Are you talking about you,

16:20.688 --> 16:23.566
or are you trying to draw
some kind of parallel?

16:23.566 --> 16:25.526
'Cause if it's you,
I'm ‐‐ I'm all in.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.571
But there is no mental illness
in my family.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.656
With or without
mental illness,

16:30.656 --> 16:33.242
the ‐‐ the human brain
is brilliant,

16:33.242 --> 16:34.869
and it is devious,

16:34.869 --> 16:37.246
and it walls off
what it doesn't want to know.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.165
Got it.
So you're talking about me.

16:39.165 --> 16:42.710
What I'm trying to say, Maya,
is that your mind is brilliant,

16:42.710 --> 16:46.297
and maybe you think you're
too smart to be in denial.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.716
Maybe you think you're too smart
to have been abused?

16:48.716 --> 16:51.010
Okay, I'm not interested
in talking.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.095
I'm just trying to help.
He never hit me.

16:54.889 --> 16:58.226
That's not the only way
you abuse somebody, Maya.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.310
My dad has never hit me,
either.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.519
He has never hit
my brother,

17:00.519 --> 17:03.814
but that doesn't mean
that we were not abused.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.691
Psychological abuse,
v‐verbal abuse ‐‐

17:05.691 --> 17:07.276
they ‐‐ they are real.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.154
I don't want to fight
with you.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.155
I don't want to fight,
either.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.448
Then I think
you should go.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.657
What?

17:13.657 --> 17:16.035
This is not
how you handle a fight.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.411
M‐M‐M‐‐

17:17.411 --> 17:18.663
Maya, I ‐‐

17:22.208 --> 17:23.291
I'm here for you.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.170
I'm not leaving.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.547
Okay, okay.
I'm ‐‐ I'm ‐‐ I'm gonna ‐‐

17:28.547 --> 17:30.424
I need ‐‐ I need to run.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.467
So I'm gonna ‐‐

17:31.467 --> 17:32.552
I'm gonna go on a run.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.098
We don't have any drugs
on here.

17:37.098 --> 17:38.391
I'm not stupid.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.392
I know ambulances
carry morphine.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.476
Okay, you hear that?

17:40.476 --> 17:41.936
That means this patient
is dying.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.396
Just let me save him, and then
we'll get you your drugs.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.564
No, drugs first.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.648
God.
Two more minutes, alright?

17:45.648 --> 17:46.816
You want to be
a murderer, too?

17:46.816 --> 17:48.943
I'm holding a gun.
Okay. Okay, okay.

17:48.943 --> 17:53.239
But I take my hands out
of this guy, he will die.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.282
Then this guy can get me
the drugs.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.033
 No, he ‐‐
he doesn't know the code.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.618
But ‐‐ But
I will give it to him

17:57.618 --> 18:00.371
if you let me save this patient
while he does it.

18:00.371 --> 18:01.747
Fine.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.083
No pressing any secret buttons
that call the cops.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.668
I promise, I don't have
anything like that.

18:05.668 --> 18:06.752
Really?

18:06.752 --> 18:08.671
Got to get a secret button
in here, man.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.148
Hey. Uh.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.983
What are you ‐‐
What are you doing here?

18:28.983 --> 18:30.693
I went for a run, and my body
just came here,

18:30.693 --> 18:32.236
so I figured I'd work out.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.362
You?

18:33.362 --> 18:35.281
Are there
any old files here,

18:35.281 --> 18:36.866
like Captain's logs?

18:36.866 --> 18:37.825
I think so.
Why?

18:37.825 --> 18:39.493
Where?
I ‐‐

18:39.493 --> 18:40.620
I‐I just need to figure
something out.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.038
Figure what out?

18:42.038 --> 18:44.707
Just who my dad was.

18:44.707 --> 18:45.875
What do you mean
who your dad was?

18:45.875 --> 18:47.376
He was our hero.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.004
He literally sacrificed his life
to save ours.

18:52.340 --> 18:55.092
What am I looking at?
My mother looks miserable.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.636
I've always had this idea

18:56.636 --> 19:00.056
that my parents had
this epic, amazing love story,

19:00.056 --> 19:01.432
that they were soulmates,
meant to be,

19:01.432 --> 19:02.558
but what
if they weren't?

19:02.558 --> 19:04.602
What if they were just
two messed‐up people

19:04.602 --> 19:06.103
who rushed into a family,

19:06.103 --> 19:07.480
and then
one of them died?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.898
Andy, do you think
maybe it's possible

19:08.898 --> 19:10.316
that you're projecting your
anxiety about your own marriage

19:10.316 --> 19:11.400
onto your parents?

19:11.400 --> 19:13.194
Why can't
I just say something

19:13.194 --> 19:15.363
without someone
writing it off as j‐just ‐‐

19:15.363 --> 19:16.739
Can I ‐‐
Can I just talk?

19:16.739 --> 19:18.324
Okay, okay.
What are you talking about?

19:18.324 --> 19:22.286
I've been going through
my dad's things, and I ‐‐

19:22.286 --> 19:24.538
I don't know ‐‐
I feel like ‐‐

19:24.538 --> 19:28.167
like maybe I didn't even know
who my dad was, like ‐‐

19:28.167 --> 19:32.546
Like, what do I actually know
about Pruitt Herrera?

19:32.546 --> 19:34.882
He was ‐‐
He was overbearing.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.384
He was controlling.
He was ‐‐

19:36.384 --> 19:38.427
If he was controlling, it was
only because he loved you.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.429
"Controlling
because he loved you."

19:40.429 --> 19:41.889
That sounds like a ‐‐

19:41.889 --> 19:43.766
like a Lifetime movie about
a person who needs to escape.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.142
Andy, you know
who your dad was.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.103
We all do.
Do we?

19:47.103 --> 19:49.480
Or do we just know
the version of him that ‐‐

19:49.480 --> 19:50.523
that he wanted us to see?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.817
No. No!

19:52.817 --> 19:55.820
You do not get to turn your dad
into a bad guy.

19:55.820 --> 19:59.573
You won the lottery of dads,
and now, just because he died,

19:59.573 --> 20:01.033
you are gonna tear down
his memory

20:01.033 --> 20:03.119
'cause it's easier than coping
with the loss of him?

20:03.119 --> 20:05.162
No, I am not gonna stand by
and watch you do that,

20:05.162 --> 20:06.247
not to my Captain.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.833
Not to your Captain?

20:08.833 --> 20:10.418
Maya, he was my dad.

20:10.418 --> 20:13.170
Yeah, and you should
count yourself lucky!

20:20.720 --> 20:22.346
I mean,
what the hell was that?

20:22.346 --> 20:25.683
Dixon's probably trading permit
approvals for political gain.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.101
Oh, God,
but that is disgusting.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.394
‐It is disgusting.
‐Yeah.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.687
It's worse than disgusting.
It's like murder.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.105
It's murder, possibly.
It's ‐‐

20:31.105 --> 20:32.440
Probably.
Well...

20:32.440 --> 20:33.566
It's more than paperwork,
though.
Right.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.025
It's like actual loss of life.
Yeah, no, I know.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.569
I ‐‐ Yes.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.322
Do we really think
Dixon's that corrupt?

20:40.322 --> 20:41.615
It would explain why

20:41.615 --> 20:43.784
the Chief's having Sullivan
do the inspections

20:43.784 --> 20:45.369
instead
of the Fire Marshal.

20:45.369 --> 20:48.205
Yeah, but do we really think
that Sullivan is that corrupt?

20:48.205 --> 20:50.374
Are you talking about
Mr. Andy Herrera?
Can we even ‐‐

20:50.374 --> 20:51.625
Don't. I can't.
God.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.795
Pruitt's probably
rolling over in his...urn.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.797
And you just assume,
you know,

20:56.797 --> 20:58.215
that anybody who becomes
a firefighter

20:58.215 --> 20:59.300
is just inherently good.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.509
Mm.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.510
Like ‐‐
Yeah.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.472
Right. But...

21:04.472 --> 21:08.309
I mean, I guess there are
some rotten apples.

21:10.060 --> 21:13.397
So are you, like, in love with
the corrupt Fire Chief's son?
No.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.857
Some drama.
No. No!

21:14.857 --> 21:16.525
Like, it feels a little ‐‐
Definitely not in love.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.902
Okay.
He's a baby.

21:17.902 --> 21:20.529
We're friends.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.199
Who can't stop having sex.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.868
Yeah.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.495
What about you?
I ‐‐

21:27.495 --> 21:29.538
You got one of these, too.
You got one of those.
Yeah, I have one of those.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.290
I had ‐‐
I had one of those.
One of those.

21:33.918 --> 21:34.960
I'm gonna go talk to him.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.420
Wait. Who? Jackson?

21:36.420 --> 21:37.505
‐Sullivan.
‐No.

21:37.505 --> 21:38.547
Yeah.
No. No, no, no!

21:38.547 --> 21:39.632
Hey!
Bye!

21:39.632 --> 21:40.758
Get back here!
Vic, don't.

21:40.758 --> 21:41.675
Vic, seriously,
don't do it.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.427
Don't do it!

21:43.427 --> 21:44.762
I tried.

21:44.762 --> 21:45.763
Hey, can I get the darts?

21:53.145 --> 21:54.855
Hey.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.981
You want some food?

21:55.981 --> 21:58.067
I can make something.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.985
Or we can order.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.111
I'm good.

22:18.546 --> 22:21.131
Hi, it's Sandra.
Leave me a message.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.550
Por favor,
deja un mensaje.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.179
Do it!
Open the damn cabinet!

22:27.179 --> 22:28.639
I'm trying!
I'm ‐‐ I‐I'm trying.

22:28.639 --> 22:30.057
I‐I don't know
the last number.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.183
Give him the number.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.643
Quickly.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.061
I know you're not a killer.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.563
I know that you ‐‐ you
didn't mean to get wrapped up

22:35.563 --> 22:37.690
with four possible murders
on your hands.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.108
I know that you just want drugs,

22:39.108 --> 22:40.234
and it's not your fault,
alright?

22:40.234 --> 22:41.527
A‐Addiction
is a terrible thing.

22:41.527 --> 22:42.903
I'm a doctor.
I see it all the time.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.030
I swear to God,
if you don't open that cabinet,

22:45.030 --> 22:47.116
I will kill all of you, and I
won't even feel bad about it

22:47.116 --> 22:49.034
because you were too stupid
to save your own lives!

22:49.034 --> 22:50.286
Ohh.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.495
Warren,
give her the damn code.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.788
 Oh, God.
Now!

22:52.788 --> 22:54.999
8375‐pound.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.419
Um. Okay.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.755
Hey, Dixon, get over here and
help me with these compressions.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.135
Dixon, let's go!

23:06.135 --> 23:07.761
Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.432
How you doing, Jackson?

23:11.432 --> 23:13.309
I'm just keeping
pressure on it.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.644
I should grab
a tourniquet soon.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.535
I don't even know
which one to ‐‐

23:33.245 --> 23:34.788
He's gone, Warren.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.833
He's got more blood on the floor
than in him.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.084
Just go.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.840
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
I‐I‐I didn't see her.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.799
No, it's ‐‐
it's not your fault, sir.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.468
It's not your fault.

23:47.468 --> 23:50.012
Dixon, radio dispatch.
Request an aid car and SPD.

23:53.015 --> 23:54.934
This is, uh ‐‐

23:54.934 --> 23:57.686
This is PRT 19 reporting...

23:57.686 --> 23:58.771
Dixon, give me the radio.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.522
Just give me the radio.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.149
Dispatch from PRT 19.

24:02.149 --> 24:05.152
We've just been assaulted
and...robbed.

24:05.152 --> 24:08.989
Got one stabbing victim
on board who's deceased,

24:08.989 --> 24:12.201
one PRT position, uh,
with a non‐critical GSW.

24:12.201 --> 24:14.703
We also have one MV‐versus‐ped
who is, uh...

24:17.373 --> 24:19.208
...who's deceased.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.793
Over.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.503
 Copy.
We have your location.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.838
Dispatching AID and SPD.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.758
Time of death?

24:27.758 --> 24:30.719
Time of death, 15:15.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.680
Times two.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.275
Hughes.
What are you doing ‐‐

24:45.275 --> 24:46.902
Uh, you can't just sign
those inspections.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.070
Oh, this is none
of your business.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.571
You can't ‐‐ No, Chief,
due respect, et cetera,

24:49.571 --> 24:51.031
but if you sign those
inspections, you could be
actually putting ‐‐

24:51.031 --> 24:52.324
You are out of your lane.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.826
Maybe, but I have also seen
what happens

24:53.826 --> 24:56.412
when people ignore fire codes.

24:56.412 --> 24:57.830
You know, we don't ever think
the worst is gonna happen

24:57.830 --> 24:59.790
until it does.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.625
What ‐‐ we watch the ‐‐ the ‐‐
the stupid video on the plane

25:01.625 --> 25:03.043
telling us
how to put on our oxygen masks,

25:03.043 --> 25:04.461
half paying attention

25:04.461 --> 25:05.963
because we don't think
there's ever, you know,

25:05.963 --> 25:08.465
any way we could be the person
who dies in a plane crash.

25:08.465 --> 25:12.094
But 257 people died
in plane crashes last year.

25:12.094 --> 25:13.762
And way more died in fires
that were easily preventable.

25:13.762 --> 25:16.682
So I don't honestly ‐‐

25:16.682 --> 25:18.475
I mean, I don't know why
you're covering this up,

25:18.475 --> 25:19.977
and I don't really care.

25:19.977 --> 25:21.937
Please.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.981
Please don't sign those.

25:23.981 --> 25:25.149
You could be signing
the death certificates

25:25.149 --> 25:27.651
for who knows
how many people, so...

25:30.946 --> 25:33.157
Hughes, my parents died
in a plane crash.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.537
I ‐‐ I didn't ‐‐

25:38.537 --> 25:40.039
I didn't know.
I'm sorry, Chief.

25:40.039 --> 25:42.166
Goodbye, Hughes.
I...

26:24.208 --> 26:26.126
There's a fire!
The ‐‐ The scrim is on fire!

26:26.126 --> 26:27.169
‐Oh, my God! Fire?!
‐What?

26:27.169 --> 26:28.921
This way!
What? Oh, my God!

26:28.921 --> 26:30.631
Through the house!
Everybody, off the stage!

26:30.631 --> 26:31.840
Through the house!
Through the house!

26:31.840 --> 26:32.966
Through the house!
Everybody off!

26:32.966 --> 26:34.051
Through the house!
This way!

26:34.051 --> 26:34.927
Go, go, go, go!

26:34.927 --> 26:36.637
Go, go, go, go, go!

26:36.637 --> 26:38.347
Go! Go!

26:38.347 --> 26:39.807
Through this way, this way,
this way!

26:39.807 --> 26:41.725
Move!
Is anybody back here?!

26:41.725 --> 26:43.018
‐
‐Watch out!

26:45.896 --> 26:47.523
Cooper!

26:47.523 --> 26:48.649
Cooper?

26:48.649 --> 26:49.566
Cooper, come on!

26:52.027 --> 26:53.237
Cooper!

26:53.237 --> 26:55.364
Cooper, what are you doing?
Get down!

26:58.325 --> 26:59.785
I forgive you.

27:01.495 --> 27:02.746
What?

27:02.746 --> 27:05.165
For sleeping
with Vasquez's wife.

27:05.165 --> 27:08.585
I know I said
it's unforgivable, but...

27:08.585 --> 27:10.796
I forgive you.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.631
Okay.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.466
Kind of felt like
that already happened.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.928
Yeah, I just wanted to make it
official, you know?

27:17.928 --> 27:19.972
I'm a dad now,
and

27:19.972 --> 27:21.932
the world just
doesn't look the same anymore.

27:21.932 --> 27:23.767
Nothing's black and white.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.435
Everything's conditional.

27:25.435 --> 27:26.520
I would have thought
having a daughter

27:26.520 --> 27:28.355
would make you hate me
even more.

27:28.355 --> 27:32.526
Jack, my ‐‐
my daughter's mother left her.

27:32.526 --> 27:33.861
She left.

27:33.861 --> 27:35.529
And  I don't know

27:35.529 --> 27:38.031
what your birth parents
did or didn't do or why,

27:38.031 --> 27:39.283
but I know
that takes a toll

27:39.283 --> 27:41.535
on a little kid's heart
and their brain.

27:41.535 --> 27:44.621
And I see that you're trying to
be a better person, and I ‐‐

27:44.621 --> 27:46.623
I admire that.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.125
Thank you.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.294
I am trying.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.796
And I also have a bit of an
inappropriate crush myself now,

27:52.796 --> 27:53.922
so...

27:53.922 --> 27:55.424
I can relate.

27:55.424 --> 27:56.842
Well, the difference
between me and you

27:56.842 --> 27:58.552
is you won't do anything
about it.

27:58.552 --> 27:59.845
Correct.

27:59.845 --> 28:02.014
I am gonna take those feelings,
take all of them,

28:02.014 --> 28:03.724
and just bury them way down.

28:03.724 --> 28:05.017
Just bury 'em.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.102
Hey, bury 'em in Sasha.
Mm.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.520
Uh, don't.
I heard it.
Mm‐hmm.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.563
Miller.
Yeah.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.023
Hey.
Why am I hearing

28:11.023 --> 28:12.608
my husband called in
an hour ago

28:12.608 --> 28:14.318
saying he needed an OR
on standby

28:14.318 --> 28:15.652
and hasn't shown up?

28:15.652 --> 28:16.737
Wait. He hasn't?

28:16.737 --> 28:18.488
Is he not responding
on radio?

28:20.782 --> 28:21.783
What is that look?

28:21.783 --> 28:23.243
I don't like that look,
Miller.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.453
Dr. Bailey.

28:24.453 --> 28:25.495
Dr. Warren's on the phone.

28:25.495 --> 28:26.872
He lost the patient.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.749
Oh. Okay,
thank you, Schmitt.

28:28.749 --> 28:31.585
So now that poor girl
killed a guy.

28:31.585 --> 28:35.339
But he says that we should be on
standby for a possible GSW.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.215
A what?

28:37.215 --> 28:39.217
Ah, at least
it went clean through.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.844
Yeah.
You're lucky.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.554
Oh, yeah,
I'm the luckiest.

28:43.931 --> 28:48.268
Hey, Dixon, uh, after this,
I'm buying you a beer.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.645
I can't.
I can't.

28:49.645 --> 28:52.147
I can't handle this.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.232
I can't.
I ‐‐

28:54.232 --> 28:56.360
All the death
and the blood

28:56.360 --> 28:57.653
and the fire
and the guns

28:57.653 --> 28:58.779
and the families
torn apart,

28:58.779 --> 29:02.783
I ‐‐ I can't take it.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.076
I don't want this to be
my every day

29:04.076 --> 29:05.410
for the rest of my life.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.620
I know today was rough,
but most of the ti‐‐

29:06.620 --> 29:09.289
Rough? Rough?

29:09.289 --> 29:13.251
No, I had a drug addict
point a gun at my face

29:13.251 --> 29:16.213
and then get splattered
on the side of the road.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.256
And then the doctor who was
trying to save a stabbing victim

29:18.256 --> 29:19.800
got shot in the leg.

29:19.800 --> 29:23.679
And that's just today.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.139
Putting out fires and rescuing
kittens, that's one thing,

29:26.139 --> 29:28.308
but this is just ‐‐

29:28.308 --> 29:30.477
It's too much.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.396
Look, um...

29:32.396 --> 29:34.106
If it makes you feel
any better,

29:34.106 --> 29:35.899
Miller texted,
and, you know,

29:35.899 --> 29:39.152
the ‐‐ the stabbing guy
was a ‐‐ a rapist.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.490
Oh, hell,
that makes me feel better.

29:45.450 --> 29:49.037
My dad wanted this.
I never wanted this.

29:49.037 --> 29:53.166
I didn't even pass
the written test.

29:53.166 --> 29:56.169
I'm not a firefighter.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.588
I'm not a firefighter.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.679
Hey.

30:05.679 --> 30:06.805
What are you
still doing here?

30:06.805 --> 30:07.639
Just catching up
on some work.

30:07.639 --> 30:08.932
You?

30:08.932 --> 30:10.726
I don't know if you heard,
but, uh,

30:10.726 --> 30:13.770
Warren and Avery were held up
on the PRT.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.731
Yeah, Avery got shot.

30:15.731 --> 30:17.399
Is he okay?

30:17.399 --> 30:21.236
Yeah. Yeah, everyone's
just a bit shaken up.

30:21.236 --> 30:24.406
Thank you for notifying me.

30:24.406 --> 30:26.033
Have you talked to Andy?
I'm worried about her.

30:26.033 --> 30:27.242
What a surprise.

30:27.242 --> 30:28.326
The men in Andy's life
are worried about her.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.454
She is fine, Jack.
She's grieving her father.

30:30.454 --> 30:33.999
Let her do that
however she needs to.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.585
She married our Battalion Chief
after a few weeks of dating,

30:36.585 --> 30:39.921
and you don't think that's
a little bit concerning?

30:39.921 --> 30:41.715
I think that Andy
is a grown woman

30:41.715 --> 30:42.883
who can make
her own decisions.

30:42.883 --> 30:45.510
She has made that very clear,
Lieutenant.

30:45.510 --> 30:48.513
We are Andy's closest friends,
Maya, you and me.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.307
And as her friends,
we should give her some space.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.517
Not everyone
needs therapy, Jack.

30:54.436 --> 30:56.772
Wow.

30:56.772 --> 31:00.192
Yeah, I told you that
in confidence, as my Captain,

31:00.192 --> 31:02.110
and you're just gonna
throw it back in my face?

31:02.110 --> 31:03.445
Sorry.

31:03.445 --> 31:04.905
That wasn't about you.

31:08.408 --> 31:11.203
Carina keeps trying
to get me to admit

31:11.203 --> 31:12.370
to something
that isn't true,

31:12.370 --> 31:13.497
and I'm sick of it.

31:13.497 --> 31:14.623
You know, my father ‐‐

31:14.623 --> 31:16.458
Is a real prick.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.959
Hey, you don't know
what you're talking about.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.044
You don't know me.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.046
No, you know I do.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.589
And you hate it

31:22.589 --> 31:24.174
because anyone who knows
the real Maya is a threat.

31:24.174 --> 31:25.592
Get out.
Right?

31:25.592 --> 31:27.427
'Cause here comes
the Maya freeze‐out.

31:27.427 --> 31:28.887
No, does Carina know
it's coming yet,

31:28.887 --> 31:31.264
or are you gonna blindside her
like you did me?

31:31.264 --> 31:32.432
Get the hell out
of my office.

31:32.432 --> 31:33.517
Way to prove my point.

31:33.517 --> 31:35.477
You're broken, Maya.
Oh!

31:35.477 --> 31:37.521
The foster boy without a daddy
is calling me broken?

31:37.521 --> 31:39.106
Yeah, well, I'd rather have
no daddy than have yours.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.816
Don't you dare talk about
my father like that.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.275
Or what?
Or I will bury you!

31:42.275 --> 31:44.528
Yeah, threats of violence.
That checks out.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.044
 Hi, it's Sandra.
Leave me a message.

32:02.963 --> 32:04.673
What ‐‐ What are you
looking for?

32:04.673 --> 32:08.385
Answers about why my father
cut my family out of my life.

32:08.385 --> 32:11.012
Why he wanted me
to be alone.

32:11.012 --> 32:12.597
Why he w‐‐

32:12.597 --> 32:14.850
Andy, this
is a little crazy.

32:18.145 --> 32:20.105
Tía Sandra sent me
a birthday card every year

32:20.105 --> 32:21.940
from age 10 to 15.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.191
I've never seen these.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.026
He ‐‐
He kept those from me.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.236
I doubt he kept them
from you.

32:26.236 --> 32:27.529
You ‐‐ You said yourself

32:27.529 --> 32:28.822
you can't remember
half the things that ‐‐

32:28.822 --> 32:30.740
Okay, you don't understand!
My father was controlling.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.784
My father ‐‐

32:32.784 --> 32:34.286
he has a track record

32:34.286 --> 32:36.913
of going behind my back
in the name of protecting me.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.624
He blocked me from becoming
Captain, twice.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.835
He kept his cancer from me,
twice!

32:41.835 --> 32:45.130
He pushed my mom
out of the Academy.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.673
"Everything I did,
I did for you."

32:46.673 --> 32:48.758
T‐That's what he told Maya right
before climbing on the roof

32:48.758 --> 32:49.801
to certain death.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.887
As if ‐‐ As if
that excuses everything.

32:51.887 --> 32:54.389
You ‐‐ Andy, you're unraveling
right now.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.266
The funeral is coming up.

32:56.266 --> 32:58.852
You're feeling
a‐all these feelings.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.061
Maybe you should take a sedative
and we'll go ‐‐

33:00.061 --> 33:03.315
Stop acting like my father!

33:03.315 --> 33:05.650
And ‐‐ And stop telling me
to take a sedative!

33:05.650 --> 33:07.569
I don't solve my problems
with drugs!

33:11.531 --> 33:12.824
Ohh!

33:12.824 --> 33:14.743
You know your father blocked you
from becoming Captain

33:14.743 --> 33:17.704
because he was worried about
how you would handle his death.

33:17.704 --> 33:19.331
And, to be honest with you,
the way you're acting right now,

33:19.331 --> 33:21.625
I can see that
he was right to worry.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.260
Wow.

33:37.390 --> 33:39.184
 Hi, it's Sandra.
Leave me a message.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.644
Por favor,
deja un mensaje.

33:47.192 --> 33:48.693
So...

33:51.071 --> 33:53.490
Yeah.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.033
I guess I am broken.

33:56.910 --> 33:59.287
I guess we both are.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.924
Avery?
You're the GSW?

34:10.924 --> 34:11.925
What the hell happened?

34:11.925 --> 34:13.342
It's an extremely long
story.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.636
Really not that long.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.763
Junkie held us up for drugs
and then shot me.

34:16.763 --> 34:17.681
With a gun?

34:17.681 --> 34:19.306
Yes, with a gun, Schmitt.

34:19.306 --> 34:20.684
Okay, my tourniquet's been on
like 20 minutes.

34:20.684 --> 34:22.018
‐Benjamin Warren.
‐I know, I know, I know.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.937
I know, just ‐‐ just ‐‐
I swear ‐‐

34:27.524 --> 34:28.358
Sullivan.

34:28.358 --> 34:29.734
Dixon's
blackmailing me now.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.360
He wants me to
forge inspections,

34:31.360 --> 34:33.446
or he's gonna go public.

34:33.446 --> 34:35.072
And you are mad at me
about this because?

34:35.072 --> 34:38.284
Because you did this!

34:38.284 --> 34:40.661
My wife's father just died.
She's falling apart.

34:42.371 --> 34:46.710
You got on your high horse
and insisted we come clean.

34:46.710 --> 34:49.254
What did you think
was gonna happen, Warren, huh?

34:49.254 --> 34:52.674
He was just gonna let us go
without any kind of retribution?

34:52.674 --> 34:54.551
You made this bed, Sullivan,
alright?

34:54.551 --> 34:57.262
And if you do his bidding now,
then you're no better than a ‐‐

34:57.262 --> 34:58.805
a junkie stealing drugs
at gunpoint.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.728
 Cooper!
What are you doing?

35:04.728 --> 35:06.146
Cooper!
 Leave through
the back of the theater!

35:06.146 --> 35:07.856
Uh, run!
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no!

35:09.899 --> 35:11.610
Cooper, get over here!
Come on, Coop!
Get the hose
to the stage, now!

35:11.610 --> 35:13.778
Come on! Come!

35:13.778 --> 35:16.906
No, no! No, Coop!

35:18.033 --> 35:22.329
‐Cooper!
‐

35:22.329 --> 35:24.247
Cooper, no!
No, no, no!

35:24.247 --> 35:26.499
You have to get back in there.
You have to go back in.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.001
You have to go back in
and get him.

35:28.001 --> 35:29.377
You have to get him.
You have to ‐‐
No, no.

35:29.377 --> 35:30.712
It's okay.
You stay with me!
He didn't listen to you!

35:30.712 --> 35:31.671
Stay with me.
He didn't listen to you!

35:31.671 --> 35:33.173
Shh, shh.

35:33.173 --> 35:35.050
It's okay.
It's okay.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.218
Why didn't he listen to you?

35:37.218 --> 35:38.595
It's not important now.
It is.

35:38.595 --> 35:40.680
It's not important now.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.975
You told him to take
the set down,

35:43.975 --> 35:48.438
and he didn't listen,
and now he's dead, and...

35:48.438 --> 35:50.607
Who's gonna ‐‐
Who's gonna tell his husband

35:50.607 --> 35:52.609
that he's dead
because he didn't listen?

35:52.609 --> 35:53.735
‐Shh.
‐Why didn't he listen?

35:53.735 --> 35:55.487
I don't know.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.489
I don't know.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.741
Why didn't...

36:11.044 --> 36:14.214
You know, Pruitt Herrera is the
reason I became a firefighter.

36:14.214 --> 36:15.423
Me too.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.010
I think Dixon's
blackmailing Sullivan

36:19.010 --> 36:20.345
into forging
inspections.

36:20.345 --> 36:21.471
What?

36:21.471 --> 36:22.681
Yeah.

36:24.099 --> 36:25.558
Why?

36:25.558 --> 36:27.310
I don't know.
I haven't figured that out yet.

36:30.105 --> 36:31.439
Do you think he's a bad guy?

36:31.439 --> 36:32.482
Dixon?
He's the worst.

36:32.482 --> 36:33.692
No, Sullivan.
Oh.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.902
I don't know, honestly.

36:35.902 --> 36:38.488
I, um ‐‐ I hope not,
for Andy's sake.

36:38.488 --> 36:39.739
For Andy's sake, what?

36:39.739 --> 36:40.949
Hey.
Hey.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.826
Thought you went home.

36:42.826 --> 36:44.119
Yeah, I was feeling blue.

36:44.119 --> 36:46.538
I wanted some baby time.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.039
Great.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.792
Well, when she wakes poopy
and hungry in 30 minutes,

36:50.792 --> 36:51.668
she is all yours.

36:51.668 --> 36:53.628
Oh, yeah.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.340
Did you tell her
about Avery?

36:57.340 --> 36:59.092
What about Avery?

36:59.092 --> 37:01.261
He got shot.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.554
What?

37:02.554 --> 37:03.346
‐Yeah.
‐What?

37:03.346 --> 37:04.347
Yeah, sorry.

37:04.347 --> 37:05.348
Should have said that earlier,
but he's fine.

37:05.348 --> 37:06.558
Are you ‐‐
It's just a GSW to the calf.

37:06.558 --> 37:07.517
He's at Grey‐Sloan.

37:07.517 --> 37:08.727
‐He's okay.
‐Wow.

37:08.727 --> 37:09.644
What?
Alright.

37:09.644 --> 37:10.770
I'll be right back.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.696
Oh, no.

37:19.696 --> 37:20.822
Hughey?
Yeah.

37:20.822 --> 37:22.073
Shut up.
Just shut up.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.952
Just bury it
wa‐a‐a‐ay down.

37:25.952 --> 37:28.079
 I am.

37:29.456 --> 37:30.498
Right on down.
Okay.

37:30.498 --> 37:31.624
Mm‐hmm.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.261
I thought you left.

37:43.261 --> 37:46.014
I‐I ‐‐ I almost did,

37:46.014 --> 37:47.432
but then I thought
you might need to talk.

37:47.432 --> 37:49.684
I don't need anything
except space.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.978
Okay.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.314
I can see that
you're pushing me away,

37:54.314 --> 37:55.774
and I want
to give you space, but ‐‐

37:55.774 --> 37:57.650
So give me space.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.778
I‐I understand
that you're going through a lot,

37:59.778 --> 38:02.822
and ‐‐ and I ‐‐ I am trying
not to be mad at you, but I ‐‐

38:02.822 --> 38:06.367
Well, I just slept with Jack
an hour ago, so be mad at that.

38:23.676 --> 38:24.594
Hey.
Hey.

38:24.594 --> 38:26.513
What are you ‐‐
I quit.

38:26.513 --> 38:30.433
Uh, I came out to my dad,
and I quit.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.294
Any old business?

38:58.294 --> 39:01.005
Seattle PD would like ‐‐

39:01.005 --> 39:02.799
 Battalion Chief.

39:02.799 --> 39:06.261
This is one of our finest fire
servicemen, Robert Sullivan.

39:06.261 --> 39:07.345
No, please.
Sit.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.889
I apologize
for the interruption.

39:09.889 --> 39:12.392
This, uh, won't take long.

39:12.392 --> 39:14.811
I have some important
information I need to share

39:14.811 --> 39:16.312
with the
Civil Service Commission.

39:16.312 --> 39:17.564
Sullivan, we're right
in the middle of a meeting.

39:17.564 --> 39:22.944
Fire Chief Dixon has
unfortunately demonstrated

39:22.944 --> 39:23.820
a pattern of corruption.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.697
Sullivan,
I'm warning you.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.490
Beginning with his decision
to cover up the theft

39:27.490 --> 39:31.119
of Schedule 2 narcotics
by a firefighter.

39:31.119 --> 39:33.079
W‐Wait.
W‐Which station?

39:33.079 --> 39:34.038
19.

39:36.666 --> 39:39.627
It was me.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.301
Snuffy.

39:46.301 --> 39:47.635
Hey, kiddo.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.971
Everything okay?

39:49.971 --> 39:51.514
I'm sorry to call
so last‐minute.

39:51.514 --> 39:53.641
I just ‐‐

39:53.641 --> 39:55.393
I need to ask you
some questions.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.061
You got pie.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.396
No need for "I'm sorry."

39:58.396 --> 39:59.522
What's up?

39:59.522 --> 40:03.192
What did you know
about my parents?

40:03.192 --> 40:04.819
What do you mean?

40:04.819 --> 40:07.447
I mean...
you knew them both.

40:07.447 --> 40:09.616
I remember you coming over
for dinner.

40:09.616 --> 40:12.535
Were they happy?

40:12.535 --> 40:13.578
Sure.
Of course they were.

40:13.578 --> 40:16.122
Don't lie to me, Snuffy.
It's me.

40:16.122 --> 40:17.874
What do you want me
to say, kid?

40:17.874 --> 40:20.919
Marriage is hard.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.754
Was my dad ‐‐

40:22.754 --> 40:24.005
Was ‐‐
Was he controlling?

40:24.005 --> 40:25.381
Was he awful to her?

40:25.381 --> 40:28.551
Was ‐‐ Was ‐‐
Was she crazy?

40:28.551 --> 40:31.095
Andy, where are you going
with this?

40:31.095 --> 40:32.805
Uh. I need to know.

40:32.805 --> 40:35.350
I‐I need to know
the truth.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.518
Look, kid...

40:37.518 --> 40:41.731
don't go picking at scabs
unless you want to bleed.

40:41.731 --> 40:46.402
What ‐‐ What the hell
does that mean?

40:47.695 --> 40:50.031
I'm sorry.

40:50.031 --> 40:51.824
It's not my place to say.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.954
I got to go, Andy,
alright?
