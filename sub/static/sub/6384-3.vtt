00:30.144 --> 00:32.174

00:32.176 --> 00:33.661
I've had way grosser dudes than you

01:21.615 --> 01:25.127
hmm..you know the house that we'r visiting on

01:25.129 --> 01:25.919
is over the value

01:25.920 --> 01:29.237
so i thought i could just get sonja drop me

01:29.518 --> 01:31.237
at lew ashby's house tonight

01:31.238 --> 01:34.299

01:35.696 --> 01:36.423
what do you think?  i'm listening.

01:37.142 --> 01:38.618
but with your hands?

01:38.621 --> 01:39.756
i'm like a blind man

01:41.796 --> 01:44.395
some of us have jobs to go to

01:44.530 --> 01:46.064
you know,like responsibility

01:46.065 --> 01:48.902
so do i.but i balance that shit

01:48.903 --> 01:50.523
i don't like the crushing pressures

01:50.524 --> 01:53.824
that will interfere the regions of my life as a  sexual being

01:53.855 --> 01:54.760
i notice  that

01:54.761 --> 01:57.647
But I don't know if getting paid six-figure sums

01:57.649 --> 02:01.075
to hang out with rock Stars all day really constitutes work

02:01.078 --> 02:03.278
-but, you know... -of course it does.

02:03.311 --> 02:04.768
Don't you want to send me off to the salt mines

02:04.769 --> 02:06.776
with a smile on my face?

02:06.809 --> 02:08.475
You're not giving up, right? okay.

02:10.841 --> 02:12.740
Oh, my god. that's -- no. hey!

02:12.773 --> 02:15.405
That's the mailman. that's the wrong number.

02:15.438 --> 02:18.171
Becca. it's mia. she's here.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.404
Hello, hello!

02:19.437 --> 02:22.802
-Nobody's home! -Knock, knock, foster family.

02:26.057 --> 02:27.035
Becca, come on.

02:27.068 --> 02:29.101
You don't want to be late on your first day.

02:29.134 --> 02:30.833
You can sulk later. honey, come on.

02:30.866 --> 02:32.066
Did you have breakfast?

02:32.100 --> 02:34.165
Did I mention I hate you?

02:34.199 --> 02:35.365
Yes, you did. I know.

02:35.397 --> 02:38.563
I'm evil, but just get out here now. please?

02:38.596 --> 02:41.029
You promise you won't make fun?

02:41.062 --> 02:41.962
Yes.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.028
No! no.

02:43.061 --> 02:44.994
Come on. we're kidding.

02:45.027 --> 02:46.727
No one's gonna make the fun.

02:46.760 --> 02:50.058
I'm sure you never looked lovelier.

02:50.092 --> 02:52.196
Parents who truly love their children

02:52.197 --> 02:55.090
make sacrifices to homeschool them.

02:55.123 --> 02:57.023
Let's go. come on. get your stuff.

02:59.322 --> 03:01.787
And, you...

03:01.821 --> 03:02.953
Good luck today.

03:02.987 --> 03:05.552
You too. kick some architectural ass.

03:05.585 --> 03:06.356
And may the force be with you,

03:06.358 --> 03:09.318
my preppy-goth princess.

03:09.352 --> 03:13.216
Hey, and whatever you do, don't be another brick in the wall!

04:32.817 --> 04:35.983
The chorus is the verse.

04:36.016 --> 04:38.949
What -- what the fuck does that mean?

04:40.581 --> 04:44.047
Work it out, grasshoppers.

04:44.080 --> 04:44.946
Smoke?

04:44.979 --> 04:47.477
Aw, no, thanks. I quit.

04:47.511 --> 04:49.011
Chorus was the verse.

04:49.045 --> 04:50.743
Yeah. the chorus was the verse.

04:50.777 --> 04:51.737
So you know you just --

04:51.739 --> 04:53.609
you just listened to that song one time?

04:53.642 --> 04:55.942
I hear. I speak. I move on. that's my job.

04:55.975 --> 04:58.507
Right. so you just operate on pure instinct?

04:58.540 --> 05:00.506
What the fuck else is there?

05:00.539 --> 05:03.591
I don't know -- intellect, technique,

05:03.591 --> 05:04.306
For instance.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.537
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.167
Warren zevon could sit down

05:07.169 --> 05:09.936
and talk 12-tone theory with, uh, stravinsky.

05:09.969 --> 05:12.081
Half the cockbags that come through

05:12.081 --> 05:14.734
Here barely play their fucking instruments.

05:14.768 --> 05:17.120
Yesterday the lead singer's girlfriend comes by with

05:17.120 --> 05:18.553
All these sprinkles cupcakes,

05:18.555 --> 05:20.428
and one of those little screamo fags in there

05:20.430 --> 05:21.701
pulls out this little plastic knife,

05:21.702 --> 05:24.145
Cuts one in half, shares it with the other johnny cupcake.

05:25.030 --> 05:28.001
Elton john going down on george michael in a public washroom --

05:29.135 --> 05:29.461
less gay.

05:29.660 --> 05:30.562
It would've been more gay

05:30.563 --> 05:33.472
if he shoves a cupcake up the other guy's ass and then ate it out of there,

05:33.474 --> 05:36.092
but thank you for putting that in my head, you know?

05:36.093 --> 05:37.624
Because I love me some elton john.

05:37.626 --> 05:39.058
Oh, you love me some elton john?

05:40.957 --> 05:42.856
What are you -- get off of my ass.

05:42.889 --> 05:45.488
Looks like we're just in time.

05:45.521 --> 05:48.021
Uh, take-out has arrived.

05:48.921 --> 05:50.786
How you doing? good.

05:52.153 --> 05:53.685
Hank moody.

05:53.718 --> 05:55.651
Beatrice trixie.

05:55.684 --> 05:57.018
You two know each other?

05:57.051 --> 06:01.682
Uh, I seem to recall... an exchange of currency, yes.

06:01.715 --> 06:02.188
Well, cool.

06:02.188 --> 06:03.744
Then you take trixie, I'll take amber,

06:03.745 --> 06:05.780
unless you want to go together? no.

06:05.814 --> 06:07.546
Swap midstream? no!

06:07.579 --> 06:08.479
No? cool.

06:08.512 --> 06:10.378
Catch you on the flip side.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.179
Amber!

06:12.212 --> 06:13.877
So...

06:13.911 --> 06:15.843
How's trix?

06:15.876 --> 06:19.642
Charlie runkle from -- um...j-just -- just charlie runkle.

06:19.675 --> 06:21.241
Where? f-from planet earth.

06:21.275 --> 06:23.274
That's where I'm calling from, okay?

06:23.306 --> 06:26.639
Meanwhile, how about we just get a lunch on...

06:26.672 --> 06:28.272
The books.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.137
Nice.

06:35.468 --> 06:36.835
Hey.

06:36.868 --> 06:38.534
Hey, I know you. how you doing?

06:38.567 --> 06:40.133
You -- you don't remember me?

06:40.167 --> 06:41.633
We met at my wife's salon.

06:41.666 --> 06:43.583
Yeah, you were having your lady needs tended to,

06:43.584 --> 06:45.013
and I was -- oh,

06:45.013 --> 06:45.798
Marcy's dude.

06:45.831 --> 06:47.098
Yes. charlie runk

06:47.131 --> 06:48.396
Daisy.

06:48.429 --> 06:50.328
Daisy. that's right. daisy. so, the lovely daisy.

06:50.362 --> 06:52.062
Where are you off to this lovely afternoon?

06:52.096 --> 06:53.461
You know, just work.

06:53.494 --> 06:56.426
Work? well, that's great. that means you scored a part.

06:57.659 --> 06:58.826
Well, you're not psyched.

06:58.859 --> 07:02.857
These guys are just total amateurs, and I hate working for them.

07:02.891 --> 07:04.886
I ju-- I understand basic impulse

07:04.888 --> 07:07.056
to want to stick your dick in something.

07:07.090 --> 07:07.989
Like, I get that.

07:08.022 --> 07:11.854
I'm just not one of these chicks that's down with objects.

07:11.888 --> 07:16.385
Objects? you know, like bottles of booze, cellphones, and whatnot.

07:16.418 --> 07:17.352
Uh, toys, sure.

07:17.385 --> 07:19.085
Food -- maybe. food's organic.

07:19.118 --> 07:20.383
Well, some of it is.

07:20.416 --> 07:23.250
I mean, you really -- you got to read the labels.

07:23.282 --> 07:23.896
But once you become that chick,

07:23.898 --> 07:25.882
you're in a box, right?

07:25.915 --> 07:28.881
Forever and ever, you're the girl that sticks stuff up there.

07:28.914 --> 07:31.201
And I just didn't get into this business to become some kind of freak show

07:31.202 --> 07:33.712
no, no. you most certainly did not. no.

07:33.745 --> 07:36.211
That's why you got to stand up for yourself with those people.

07:36.245 --> 07:38.244
You got to tell them what you just told me.

07:38.276 --> 07:38.663
Yeah, right,

07:38.663 --> 07:40.244
Like they really want to hear that from some

07:40.244 --> 07:42.042
Chick just off the bus from hicksville.

07:42.076 --> 07:44.608
How are you gonna get what you want if you don't ask for it, huh?

07:44.641 --> 07:47.973
I'll tell you what we're gonna do -- let me talk to them for you.

07:48.006 --> 07:50.243
That sounds really nice, but -- I'm gonna go with you to the set,

07:50.243 --> 07:52.271
Actually, that -- I'll put in a few well-chosen words...

07:52.304 --> 07:54.937
-That sounds really great but, um... -what's up, sweetheart?

07:54.970 --> 07:58.236
You and, uh, uncle fester need a lift?

07:58.268 --> 07:59.901
Um, look, mister, you've been really...

07:59.901 --> 08:02.135
Nice, but that's actually my ride, so I have to go.

08:02.168 --> 08:03.299
Hey, hey. not so fast.

08:03.333 --> 08:05.066
Are you going to the set? I'll come with.

08:05.099 --> 08:06.565
How you doing, pal?

08:06.599 --> 08:08.464
Okay, shove over, make room.

08:08.498 --> 08:11.064
One real hollywood agent at your service.

08:12.263 --> 08:13.321
In case they don't want to do that,

08:13.322 --> 08:16.394
i-i've prepared a couple of options.

08:16.428 --> 08:18.260
But -- so we've got...

08:18.293 --> 08:21.392
The safe...approach, which is that.

08:21.426 --> 08:26.191
And then we've got the more radical approach -- honey, honey.

08:26.225 --> 08:29.256
I think you're throwing karen off. jesus. no, no. it's fine.

08:29.289 --> 08:30.735
I'm the one that's intruding.

08:30.821 --> 08:31.332
I, um,

08:31.368 --> 08:34.030
I just wanted to check in with you

08:34.030 --> 08:36.687
Before we meet the clent and to through£¬um...

08:36.720 --> 08:39.652
It's not really your forte, is it...

08:39.686 --> 08:41.119
Selling yourself?

08:41.152 --> 08:43.283
Well, I'm not selling myself.

08:43.317 --> 08:45.282
I'm selling my works.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.183
Hey, give me your wrist.

08:47.217 --> 08:49.315
I don't really want to give you my wrist.

08:49.348 --> 08:51.081
Karen? go with it, okay?

08:51.115 --> 08:52.747
Trust me. the man knows his shit.

08:52.780 --> 08:55.579
-Oh, of course, i-i just... -give me your wrist.

08:55.612 --> 08:57.278
Oh, my god. here's my wrist.

08:57.312 --> 08:58.611
Thank you.

09:00.777 --> 09:03.809
Close your eyes.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.308
Close your eyes.

09:05.341 --> 09:07.774
Don't be scared.

09:07.807 --> 09:09.108
Good.

09:09.141 --> 09:09.355
Now,

09:09.355 --> 09:12.126
We all have this pressure point in our

09:12.126 --> 09:15.771
Wrists right about here that reduces nervousness.

09:17.270 --> 09:19.903
Your heart is racing.

09:19.937 --> 09:21.702
Why is that?

09:23.856 --> 09:26.134
Mm-hmm. because you're feeling judged.

09:27.607 --> 09:30.132
The artist within feels threatened...

09:30.165 --> 09:32.065
Under attack.

09:32.099 --> 09:34.464
Now, those are very primal emotions.

09:34.497 --> 09:36.663
You don't have to be ashamed. now, listen to me, karen.

09:36.696 --> 09:39.820
I'm here to tell you -- if you're operating from a

09:39.820 --> 09:43.693
Place of inner strength and conviction, anything is possible.

09:43.727 --> 09:45.059
Yes.

09:45.093 --> 09:52.057
And no dream that you dare to dream can be beyond your grasp.

09:53.689 --> 09:55.788
Thank you.

09:55.822 --> 09:58.088
Believe it.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.618
Thanks.

10:04.652 --> 10:06.250
This is totally uncool, daisy.

10:06.284 --> 10:08.349
What the fuck? you had to bring your boyfriend?

10:08.383 --> 10:09.850
He is not my boyfriend.

10:09.883 --> 10:11.449
I'm just along for the ride, fellas.

10:11.482 --> 10:13.381
Hey, hey, where we shooting today anyway, huh?

10:13.414 --> 10:14.881
Do you know what a hassle this is?

10:14.915 --> 10:17.081
You know what? we're just gonna have to fuzz him out.

10:17.114 --> 10:18.813
Fuzz me out of what?

10:18.846 --> 10:20.808
Listen, brother, if you want to ride in the slam van,

10:20.808 --> 10:21.978
You've got to sign a release.

10:22.012 --> 10:24.343
I'm sorry. "the slam van"?

10:25.443 --> 10:26.976
Fuzz me out of what?!

10:27.010 --> 10:29.575
Look, I don't even understand what the problem is, all right?

10:29.608 --> 10:31.541
I'm just -- I'm catching a ride to the set.

10:31.574 --> 10:33.440
I'm gonna say hello once to the director.

10:33.473 --> 10:35.939
The -- the set? this is the set.

10:35.972 --> 10:38.337
And I -- hello -- am the director.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.303
Oh, you're the director.

10:40.336 --> 10:43.536
Yeah. charlie runkle, utk -- or formerly utk.

10:43.569 --> 10:47.201
Listen, I'm not familiar with your work, per se, all right?

10:47.234 --> 10:51.499
But I think it's safe to say we're both big fans of daisy, here, right?

10:51.533 --> 10:52.865
Yeah, yeah. you know what?

10:52.899 --> 10:54.531
I'd be an even bigger fan of daisy

10:54.531 --> 10:56.497
If she would start schlobbing some knob.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.530
Now, daisy, can you hurry it up, please?

10:58.563 --> 11:00.529
We are losing daylight, sweetheart. all right, all right.

11:00.562 --> 11:02.828
You know what? um, fuck it.

11:02.861 --> 11:06.161
We're just gonna put popeye in this scene here anyway, man.

11:06.193 --> 11:09.592
You know what? you be her daddy or something in this one.

11:09.626 --> 11:11.625
Or maybe a creepy uncle, okay?

11:11.658 --> 11:13.323
Daisy, you're going to get some ice cream.

11:13.357 --> 11:15.456
Your car breaks down -- shit like that. okay.

11:15.489 --> 11:16.790
Let's just start sucking. okay.

11:16.823 --> 11:19.122
All right. on my go!

11:19.156 --> 11:20.654
And...action!

11:20.688 --> 11:23.987
It was so cool of you to help me out like this.

11:24.020 --> 11:29.384
I just wish there was some way I could...thank you.

11:31.817 --> 11:36.248
What the f-- whoa! shit!

11:36.281 --> 11:37.981
Uh-oh. daddy no likey.

11:38.014 --> 11:40.713
Daisy, what are you do-- oh, geez!

11:40.746 --> 11:42.812
Oh, come on, little girl. aw, fuck!

11:42.845 --> 11:45.377
Make daddy proud. little girl, make daddy proud.

11:45.411 --> 11:47.644
Okay, there you go.

11:47.678 --> 11:49.710
See, it's your friend. it's your friend.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.208
Uh-oh. it's getting bigger.

11:51.242 --> 11:52.975
It's getting meaner. fight back!

11:54.741 --> 11:58.939
Then she jumped into the car, and we drove off into the sunset.

11:58.973 --> 12:01.338
Well, no, it was -- it was actually dark already.

12:01.371 --> 12:02.904
But you get the idea, huh?

12:02.937 --> 12:04.370
Awesome. good for you.

12:04.404 --> 12:07.403
Yeah, and we've been living happily ever after ever since.

12:07.436 --> 12:08.402
Pretty much.

12:08.435 --> 12:10.467
"pretty much"?

12:13.100 --> 12:15.999
It's a long story, but, um...

12:16.033 --> 12:20.217
One night, I ended up becoming the accidental oralist to this very naked,

12:20.217 --> 12:21.263
Very young girl.

12:21.296 --> 12:23.096
It's been a sticking point.

12:23.130 --> 12:25.695
I don't really know what that means, but it sounds bad.

12:26.895 --> 12:29.594
Do you want a tug job?

12:29.627 --> 12:31.860
Is that with the -- the foot?

12:33.191 --> 12:34.392
No -- what?

12:34.425 --> 12:36.824
A little hand release? oh, no, thanks.

12:36.858 --> 12:38.423
I'm not a big fan of hand work in general.

12:38.456 --> 12:40.350
And I don't think it would be appropriate,

12:40.350 --> 12:41.922
Given the story I just told you.

12:41.956 --> 12:44.721
I was just asking. I am on the clock.

12:44.755 --> 12:46.353
Record company's dime.

12:46.387 --> 12:48.919
Not that you're not doing a great job on my toes.

12:52.218 --> 12:54.584
I just thought I'd put it out there.

12:54.617 --> 12:55.950
It's hardly cheating.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.415
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is.

12:59.448 --> 13:00.648
Maybe you're right.

13:00.681 --> 13:03.380
Sometimes my whore logic gets all fucked up.

13:03.413 --> 13:05.910
But I can tell you that there's a lot of husbands and

13:05.910 --> 13:08.878
Boyfriends out there who would not file that under "cheating."

13:08.911 --> 13:11.032
Yeah, well, call me an old fuddy-duddy,

13:11.032 --> 13:15.274
But I think anytime the tumescent head makes an appearance, it's cheating.

13:15.308 --> 13:16.675
Is that good dirty talk?

13:16.708 --> 13:20.107
Like, if I said to a client, "you're so fucking tumescent right now,

13:20.107 --> 13:21.172
" would that be hot?

13:21.206 --> 13:24.205
Makes my wiener feel a little weird, but that's just me.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.804
I like words.

13:25.838 --> 13:27.738
How come you never called me?

13:27.771 --> 13:30.736
If you remember, I was a little strapped for cash.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.434
You could have called to ask me out on a proper date.

13:33.468 --> 13:35.800
I did give you my card, didn't i?

13:35.834 --> 13:37.966
I just figured you give it to all the fellas.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.766
No. no?

13:39.799 --> 13:41.198
No.

13:41.231 --> 13:43.831
You really got under my skin, hank moody.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.896
I just couldn't shake you off.

13:45.930 --> 13:46.186
Like,

13:46.186 --> 13:49.512
I'd be blowing some gross persian dude at the whore

13:49.512 --> 13:53.293
Seasons and I'd be thinking, "i wonder how hank's doing?"

13:53.326 --> 13:56.158
Fuck, that's romantic.

14:00.323 --> 14:02.057
Are you guys gonna bang or what?

14:02.091 --> 14:03.656
What's it to you, bo bice?

14:03.689 --> 14:04.823
I don't know.

14:04.856 --> 14:08.125
I was just thinking about how rad it would be to bend you over that

14:08.125 --> 14:11.786
Balcony and scream, "i'm the king of the world!" as I'm about to pop, huh?

14:11.820 --> 14:13.619
How about in a bed with a condom?

14:13.652 --> 14:14.685
Whatever, dude.

14:14.719 --> 14:15.784
Sure about this?

14:15.818 --> 14:17.051
All in a day's work.

14:17.085 --> 14:19.316
Hey, man, you want to watch for your book?

14:19.350 --> 14:21.582
Oh, hey, thanks, but I'll pass.

14:21.616 --> 14:22.982
Be good to the lady.

14:23.015 --> 14:24.848
Don't fuck up her toes.

14:55.835 --> 14:58.200
You might not want to sit there.

14:58.233 --> 15:01.166
Why? have you got the herp or something?

15:02.932 --> 15:04.265
No.

15:04.298 --> 15:05.965
Then I'm good.

15:07.130 --> 15:08.663
Look, but s-seriously.

15:08.697 --> 15:12.262
If you sit here, people are gonna think you're weird.

15:13.928 --> 15:15.361
How unfortunate.

15:15.393 --> 15:19.993
And here I was planning to run for prom queen.

15:22.625 --> 15:24.257
You're weird.

15:24.290 --> 15:27.922
At least I'm not the only boy at an all-girls school.

15:29.689 --> 15:34.653
For your information, I don't actually go here.

15:34.687 --> 15:36.319
I got suspended from my real school.

15:36.352 --> 15:37.786
Some bullshit I didn't even do.

15:37.819 --> 15:38.716
And my mom was like,

15:38.716 --> 15:41.474
"there's no f'ing way you're sitting on the couch all day,

15:41.474 --> 15:42.684
Playing 'guitar hero.'"

15:42.717 --> 15:45.082
She's a teacher here.

15:45.115 --> 15:47.315
English, I presume.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.179
Uh, mrs. patterson.

15:52.646 --> 15:54.378
What, do you have her or something?

15:54.412 --> 15:56.377
3rd period.

15:56.411 --> 15:58.610
But ethan frome gave you away.

15:58.643 --> 16:01.375
Tsk. right.

16:01.409 --> 16:04.207
Yeah, she's making me read this entire stupid book.

16:04.241 --> 16:06.974
Some sort of punishment.

16:08.406 --> 16:10.006
I'm sorry. I talk a lot.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.905
You do.

16:11.939 --> 16:14.671
And you forgot the most important part...

16:14.704 --> 16:15.903
Are you any good?

16:17.670 --> 16:19.435
You know, "guitar hero."

16:36.528 --> 16:39.694
Oh, man, I think I just found the keys to my chi.

16:39.727 --> 16:40.760
How's trix?

16:40.793 --> 16:42.526
She was fantastic. she's a real dame.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.026
We didn't do anything, though. we just hung out.

16:45.058 --> 16:47.278
Well, if I knew you were just gonna hang out,

16:47.278 --> 16:50.556
Talk about your feelings and shit, I would've gone with trixie.

16:50.589 --> 16:53.221
I mean, she's my favorite, my best. totally gets me.

16:53.254 --> 16:56.656
I know you reside in a whole other solar system and shit, but in mine,

16:56.656 --> 16:57.987
I don't cheat on my girl.

16:59.786 --> 17:03.284
Ladies and gentlemen -- hank moody, debauched moralist.

17:03.317 --> 17:05.250
Why don't you, uh...

17:05.284 --> 17:07.348
Why don't you tell me more about your girl?

17:07.383 --> 17:09.348
What girl? you know, the one. the one that got away.

17:09.382 --> 17:10.948
The one with the house in beverly hills.

17:10.981 --> 17:12.446
Your daisy buchanan.

17:12.451 --> 17:15.046
That's not cool, moody, calling back that shit. I was gorked.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.178
I don't talk about that stuff in broad daylight.

17:17.212 --> 17:19.511
I don't know if you got the memo, but I'm writing your biography.

17:19.545 --> 17:20.673
You might want to start getting

17:20.673 --> 17:22.676
Comfortable talking about this shit in broad daylight.

17:22.710 --> 17:24.142
This is it, lew. I am done.

17:24.175 --> 17:26.742
No more of you and your fucking white-trash lottery winners!

17:26.775 --> 17:28.307
What's wrong, sweetheart?

17:28.339 --> 17:30.166
That fucking asshole got rough with me,

17:30.166 --> 17:32.039
And he went way off the fucking menu!

17:32.072 --> 17:33.805
What'd he do, honey? you all right?

17:33.839 --> 17:35.671
I'm fine! luckily, he's a quick comer.

17:35.704 --> 17:37.337
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, trix.

17:37.371 --> 17:39.436
They're animals. they don't know any better.

17:39.470 --> 17:39.846
Yeah, well,

17:39.846 --> 17:41.266
Someone's gonna have to deal with the

17:41.266 --> 17:43.301
Cleveland steamer that he left on your coffee table.

17:43.334 --> 17:44.668
Really? really.

17:44.701 --> 17:45.834
Jesus!

17:45.867 --> 17:47.300
Consuela!

17:47.333 --> 17:49.566
Consuela!

17:49.599 --> 17:52.965
You're a fucking prick! you know that? thank you.

17:52.999 --> 17:54.297
Show some respect.

17:54.330 --> 17:55.897
What, to a fucking whore? come on.

18:00.761 --> 18:03.360
What the fuck are you doing, moody?!

18:03.393 --> 18:06.225
Slash traded me that les paul for an eightball! fuck!

18:06.259 --> 18:08.725
Get him!

18:10.891 --> 18:14.222
I swear to god, I'll kill you!

18:18.754 --> 18:20.653
Back to work, assholes.

18:20.686 --> 18:22.653
We're making rock history here.

18:22.686 --> 18:24.952
Act accordingly.

18:27.818 --> 18:30.450
Look how great your tits are!

18:30.483 --> 18:34.248
Celebrate them! that's it, daisy! moan!

18:34.281 --> 18:36.280
Moan like it hurts a little.

18:36.313 --> 18:40.412
Not like an operation, more like -- like a dentist visit.

18:40.446 --> 18:42.245
Come on, baby! slam her, flex!

18:42.278 --> 18:45.876
How long does this generally go on for, huh, these, uh, cinema

18:45.876 --> 18:47.076
Masterpieces of yours?

18:47.109 --> 18:49.275
Asshole, shut the fuck up!

18:49.308 --> 18:51.541
Okay! okay! okay! I'll mind my business.

18:52.641 --> 18:56.105
I'm just a passenger on the slam van.

18:56.138 --> 18:59.471
Just along for the ride.

18:59.505 --> 19:00.676
Although I got to say, daisy,

19:00.676 --> 19:02.770
I'm a little bit surprised to see you like this.

19:02.804 --> 19:04.736
What are you talking about? you knew I did porn.

19:04.769 --> 19:05.212
Yes, I did,

19:05.212 --> 19:08.400
But the girl I met back at hot lips had bigger plans for herself, huh?

19:08.434 --> 19:10.833
She had goals, she had dreams, she had ambition.

19:10.867 --> 19:15.131
She did not -- and I quote -- "want to end up the ass-licker."

19:15.165 --> 19:16.130
Yeah, well, I'm not.

19:16.164 --> 19:17.965
You see any other girls in this van?

19:17.997 --> 19:19.930
I'm totally the star of this production.

19:19.964 --> 19:22.295
This production is one notch above snuff film.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.394
Hey, easy, brother.

19:23.428 --> 19:24.828
Two more payments, and I own this van.

19:24.862 --> 19:27.861
Did you negotiate before you got on this van, daisy, huh?

19:27.894 --> 19:30.526
Did you lay clear rules for what you will and will not do? no.

19:30.559 --> 19:32.158
Then how you gonna get respect, huh?

19:32.191 --> 19:33.524
How you gonna get paid accordingly?

19:33.557 --> 19:35.123
What's the industry standard here, anyway?

19:35.157 --> 19:36.289
Double for anal? am I right?

19:36.323 --> 19:38.188
Dumb shit, we're shooting in a van.

19:38.222 --> 19:39.288
So what?

19:39.322 --> 19:41.020
Does fairness not exist in a van, huh?

19:41.054 --> 19:42.845
Just because we're not on a sound stage,

19:42.845 --> 19:45.135
Does this young lady not deserve the same dignity,

19:45.135 --> 19:47.985
The same respect as someone on a sitcom or a broadway play?

19:48.018 --> 19:50.318
Look, mr. runkle, it's fine, really.

19:50.351 --> 19:51.917
No, no, no, daisy, it is not fine.

19:51.951 --> 19:53.956
There's a limit to how much someone can get

19:53.956 --> 19:56.148
Fucked in the ass without getting paid for it!

19:56.181 --> 19:59.280
And you, young lady, today, have reached that limit!

19:59.314 --> 20:01.079
That's it! bigs, stop the van!

20:01.112 --> 20:02.746
What?

20:02.780 --> 20:04.978
Ovitz! hit the bricks! get the fuck out!

20:05.011 --> 20:07.878
With pleasure!

20:07.911 --> 20:09.877
Daisy? um, I'm good.

20:09.910 --> 20:12.442
Little girl, you're going too, sweetheart.

20:12.476 --> 20:13.541
Go make your dreams come true.

20:13.575 --> 20:15.141
But I didn't do anything!

20:15.174 --> 20:16.373
O-u-g-h-t -- out!

20:16.407 --> 20:17.973
She's real scared of you.

20:18.006 --> 20:19.773
Let me tell you something, al goldstein.

20:19.806 --> 20:20.772
Talent runs this town!

20:20.805 --> 20:22.371
See you at the oscars, pal.

20:22.405 --> 20:23.404
Let's go!

20:23.437 --> 20:26.336
Let's just shoot it solo, baby.

20:27.636 --> 20:30.202
Oh, you left your -- your shirt.

20:30.235 --> 20:31.734
No problem.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.933
Here you go.

20:35.965 --> 20:37.199
Thank you.

20:38.531 --> 20:40.665
Looks good.

20:43.030 --> 20:46.328
Where the fuck are we?

20:46.361 --> 20:48.128
It's basic instinct, really.

20:48.161 --> 20:50.294
When I see a girl in trouble, I just react.

20:50.327 --> 20:53.559
I don't think. I just do.

20:53.592 --> 20:56.324
Hank moody, my hero.

20:56.357 --> 20:59.590
Just say the word if you want to be properly rewarded.

20:59.623 --> 21:00.889
My treat, of course.

21:00.923 --> 21:02.656
Seriously, you'd comp him?

21:02.689 --> 21:05.354
Sure, why not? I've sampled the merchandise.

21:05.388 --> 21:06.520
I know it's fresh.

21:06.554 --> 21:08.119
I do remember you telling me that you

21:08.119 --> 21:09.853
Never came that hard with a john before.

21:09.886 --> 21:11.759
I thought it was a line, but as you walked away,

21:11.759 --> 21:14.224
Your knees were a little wobbly, so I thought, "maybe, yeah --"

21:14.225 --> 21:15.417
Hold on. Slow down.

21:15.451 --> 21:18.415
Are you saying he's fucking better than me?

21:18.449 --> 21:19.882
Fucking better at the fucking, yes.

21:19.916 --> 21:21.481
I believe that's what she's getting at.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.313
No, that is not what I'm getting at.

21:23.346 --> 21:24.780
Please. What a stupid question.

21:24.814 --> 21:26.512
Are the stones better than the beatles?

21:26.546 --> 21:27.746
Fucking "a" they are.

21:27.779 --> 21:29.211
I must agree with the man.

21:29.244 --> 21:31.677
Okay, there's only one way to settle this.

21:31.710 --> 21:33.076
We both have to have her.

21:33.110 --> 21:34.576
We both have had her. No.

21:34.609 --> 21:35.775
Now. right here.

21:35.809 --> 21:37.875
Oh, no. no, no, no. Trixie, you know I'm a fan.

21:37.909 --> 21:40.374
You got mad skills and all -- whip it out, Moody!

21:40.407 --> 21:42.773
One girl, two cocks -- ultimate showdown.

21:42.807 --> 21:44.938
So, so tempting. but I'm still gonna have to pass.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.304
-What's that word again? Uh, "pussy."  -Yes, thank you.

21:47.337 --> 21:50.537
But any scenario involving two cocks I'm generally not down with.

21:50.570 --> 21:51.968
Unless they're my own.

21:52.002 --> 21:54.334
Don't you sometimes wish you had two cocks?

21:54.368 --> 21:55.701
I know I do. Oh!

21:55.735 --> 21:56.767
I guess not.

21:56.801 --> 21:58.419
For the sake of, uh, business,

21:58.419 --> 22:01.432
That little prick should think I'm kicking your ass.

22:01.465 --> 22:04.164
Feel free to fight back anytime.

22:16.992 --> 22:19.425
What's going on?

22:19.458 --> 22:21.824
Typical male-ego bullshit.

22:23.890 --> 22:24.976
I've had both of them,

22:24.976 --> 22:28.387
But what they seem to forget is that they both paid for the sex.

22:28.421 --> 22:30.820
It is my job to make them feel good.

22:34.118 --> 22:37.101
Though I must say that the brown-haired one,

22:37.101 --> 22:40.915
Hank -- he's pretty damn good in the sack department.

22:43.149 --> 22:44.114
Have we met?

22:44.148 --> 22:46.447
No. Trixie.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.046
Karen.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.346
You're Karen.

22:50.279 --> 22:51.545
Hank's Karen.

22:51.578 --> 22:52.745
That's right.

22:52.779 --> 22:55.909
You jumped in the car! Happily ever after.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.243
That's awesome! good for you!

22:58.276 --> 22:59.308
Thanks.

23:05.173 --> 23:06.773
Karen.

23:06.806 --> 23:09.638
Hey! hey! sweetie!

23:11.137 --> 23:13.070
Hey, did you get the job?

23:13.103 --> 23:14.035
Yeah.

23:14.069 --> 23:15.869
Oh, fantastic.

23:17.869 --> 23:20.534
So, you want to...

23:20.567 --> 23:23.599
Get something to eat?

23:23.632 --> 23:26.030
Moroccan? Ethiopian?

23:26.064 --> 23:28.164
Italian.

23:28.197 --> 23:30.430
Indian!

23:34.194 --> 23:35.893
Hey, sweetie.

23:37.127 --> 23:40.493
Are you tucking me in or avoiding mom?

23:40.526 --> 23:43.890
What, I can't do two things at once?

23:45.524 --> 23:47.289
Was it worth it?

23:47.323 --> 23:48.289
What?

23:48.323 --> 23:51.087
Whatever you did to piss her off.

23:54.220 --> 23:55.918
How was school?

23:57.152 --> 23:58.651
Fine.

23:58.685 --> 24:00.084
"fine"?

24:00.118 --> 24:02.250
Already your vocabulary has decreased.

24:02.283 --> 24:06.415
I met someone with frontal-lobe capacity.

24:06.448 --> 24:07.815
-Name?  -Damien.

24:07.849 --> 24:11.113
They have girls named Damien now? wow.

24:11.146 --> 24:12.413
We're i.m.ing as we speak.

24:13.812 --> 24:16.177
Not anymore, honey.

24:16.211 --> 24:19.377
T.t.y.l., Damien. t.t.y.l.

24:19.410 --> 24:20.975
I heart you.

24:33.038 --> 24:35.471
Oh, my god. you reek of cigarettes.

24:35.504 --> 24:38.002
Yes, but they're not my cigarettes.

24:42.301 --> 24:43.834
Hank...

24:43.866 --> 24:45.367
What are you doing?

24:45.400 --> 24:48.598
I am charming you into

24:48.599 --> 24:50.599
our first post-snip, safe/unsafe romance explosion.

24:50.631 --> 24:52.664
Are you as excited as I am?

24:52.697 --> 24:54.696
No.

24:54.730 --> 24:56.028
No?

24:56.061 --> 24:57.795
That's it? no?

24:57.829 --> 25:00.860
Nothing about you is really turning me on right now.

25:00.893 --> 25:02.460
There's always angry sex.

25:03.991 --> 25:06.157
You actually think this is funny?

25:06.191 --> 25:07.992
It's a little funny -- you think

25:07.992 --> 25:10.523
Sleeping with prostitutes is fucking funny?!

25:10.557 --> 25:13.688
One prostitute, and I didn't even know she was a prostitute until after.

25:13.722 --> 25:16.821
You mean until after you paid her to have sex with you?

25:16.853 --> 25:19.286
Well, technically, Charlie paid for the sex. that's disgusting.

25:19.319 --> 25:20.686
But you met her. she was nice, right?

25:20.720 --> 25:22.218
She didn't seem like a prostitute, did she?

25:22.251 --> 25:24.250
I have no idea, hank.

25:24.284 --> 25:26.516
I mean, you're the expert. you tell me.

25:26.550 --> 25:28.515
Is there like a group-discount thing?

25:28.549 --> 25:30.915
Do you have a little punch card that you use?

25:30.948 --> 25:32.914
One time. I was lonely. she was nice.

25:32.947 --> 25:35.680
And I don't think that's any worse than buying somebody a drink.

25:35.714 --> 25:37.045
Actually, I think it's more honest.

25:37.079 --> 25:38.578
There's no bullshit element of seduction.

25:38.611 --> 25:41.255
You know, what right does the government have -- Oh, please!

25:41.255 --> 25:42.644
Shut the fuck up, Hank, okay?

25:42.677 --> 25:42.986
I mean,

25:42.986 --> 25:44.727
Don't give me one of your fucking

25:44.727 --> 25:47.208
Bullshit lectures on libertarianism right now!

25:47.241 --> 25:48.713
But, honey, that makes me kind of sad,

25:48.713 --> 25:51.340
Because you used to love my bullshit lectures on libertarianism.

25:51.373 --> 25:52.640
You're still fucking joking.

25:52.673 --> 25:54.539
No, I mean, how could I be -- we weren't together.

25:54.572 --> 25:58.137
I'm not gonna be held accountable for those sins. no, of course not.

25:58.171 --> 26:00.070
You're not accountable for any of it.

26:00.103 --> 26:02.369
"oops, I accidentally went down on her.

26:02.402 --> 26:03.601
Not my fault."

26:03.635 --> 26:06.001
"oh, officer, you know, that cop, he provoked me."

26:06.034 --> 26:09.032
I mean, hank, you always have some fucking excuse!

26:09.066 --> 26:12.185
-And I'm just meant to stand here and accept it... -no, no -- ...

26:12.185 --> 26:14.197
Over and over again and I'm sick of it!

26:14.198 --> 26:15.997
Fuck, karen, you want to be mad about that shit?

26:16.030 --> 26:17.614
Then go ahead, be mad about that shit,

26:17.614 --> 26:20.267
But just don't give me some bullshit about how you forgive me

26:20.267 --> 26:23.094
And then dredge up shit from the past that I can't possibly fix!

26:23.127 --> 26:24.727
That's not forgiveness!

26:24.760 --> 26:26.359
That's not giving it another shot!

26:26.392 --> 26:28.526
I'm not talking about the past, okay?

26:28.558 --> 26:30.258
I'm talking about right now.

26:30.291 --> 26:32.990
I'm talking about trying to make this work, hank!

26:33.023 --> 26:35.022
Okay, well, how am I different from this morning?

26:35.056 --> 26:36.722
What's changed?

26:36.755 --> 26:39.721
Yeah, nothing's changed. you're right.

26:39.754 --> 26:41.086
That's the fucking problem.

26:41.087 --> 26:41.211
No,

26:41.211 --> 26:43.182
I'll tell you the fucking problem is that

26:43.183 --> 26:44.119
I won't sit here

26:44.120 --> 26:46.619
And be crucified for shit that I did while we were apart.

26:46.651 --> 26:48.296
Did I fuck half of Venice? yes.

26:48.298 --> 26:49.547
oh, plea-- I -- no, not really.

26:49.547 --> 26:51.182
I really don't need to hear that.

26:51.183 --> 26:52.616
But for the sake of this argument -- yes.

26:52.649 --> 26:53.945
But I didn't move in with any of them.

26:53.947 --> 26:55.361
And I didn't set up house

26:55.362 --> 26:57.006
with Becca and the fucking dial tone.

26:57.007 --> 26:57.570
Okay, right.

26:57.826 --> 27:01.012
Well, you know, now who's crucifying who?!

27:01.046 --> 27:03.578
I mean, that's not very forgiving, hank, is it?

27:03.611 --> 27:04.810
It's not very nice.

27:04.343 --> 27:06.243
Oh, I fucking hate you!
