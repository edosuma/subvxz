00:12.840 --> 00:14.640
[footsteps approaching]

00:20.200 --> 00:22.600
[applause]

00:22.680 --> 00:24.360
-[camera shutter clicking]
-[man] Friends...

00:24.440 --> 00:25.640
Friends...

00:28.200 --> 00:33.680
We meet here today
not as Ghanaians, Guineans,

00:33.760 --> 00:35.720
Moroccans, Algerians,

00:35.800 --> 00:37.640
Senegalese or Malians,

00:37.720 --> 00:42.240
-but as Africans...
-[chattering]

00:42.320 --> 00:46.360
-tired of being disrespected and abused...
-[birds squawking]

00:46.440 --> 00:50.160
...by the corrupt and imperial
powers of the past.

00:50.240 --> 00:54.760
The time has come to forge new alliances.

00:54.840 --> 00:59.360
Those who understand
the strategic importance of Africa

01:00.280 --> 01:03.960
and are willing to treat us as equals.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.680
Not as subordinates!

01:07.320 --> 01:09.600
And not as slaves!

01:10.400 --> 01:12.400
This is our time.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.800
We must choose our own destiny!

01:15.880 --> 01:17.360
[goat bleats]

01:18.040 --> 01:19.760
A socialist Africa!

01:20.720 --> 01:22.480
[chattering]

01:22.560 --> 01:24.520
For Africans!

01:24.600 --> 01:26.920
[applause]

01:34.480 --> 01:37.280
[applause continues]

01:44.040 --> 01:46.520
-It's definitely seen better days, ma'am.
-[Elizabeth] Mm.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.200
We'll send in the foresters at the end
of the season, cut it back.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.080
-[Elizabeth] Yes.
-The old oak, she's still hanging on.

01:52.160 --> 01:55.320
-[man] Just about.
-Oh, but she looks so old. Ancient.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.520
[man] Well, she will have
to be felled in due course.

01:57.600 --> 02:00.080
-[Elizabeth] What a shame.
-Looks like it's set in for the day.

02:00.160 --> 02:01.880
You remember my grandson, Daniel,
ma'am?

02:02.760 --> 02:05.280
[Elizabeth] Yes, of course.
I was at his christening.

02:05.360 --> 02:06.520
[man] That's right.

02:06.600 --> 02:07.440
[dogs whimpering]

02:07.520 --> 02:09.960
We ought to head back, ma'am.
Get you out of this rain.

02:10.039 --> 02:11.120
[Elizabeth] Right.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.560
[man] I'll go get the jump leads;
the engine's packed in.

02:13.640 --> 02:14.960
[Elizabeth] What, again?

02:15.040 --> 02:16.600
-[dogs whimper]
-[Elizabeth sighs]

02:16.680 --> 02:19.560
-[Daniel] Can I help, ma'am?
-Oh. Thank you.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.480
[Daniel] Pull! Pull!

02:24.560 --> 02:26.200
[groaning] Oh! Aah!

02:26.280 --> 02:28.440
-Sorry, you all right, ma'am?
-Yes, fine, thank you.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.040
Oh.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.240
[exhales]

02:34.000 --> 02:35.320
[sighs]

02:39.960 --> 02:42.240
[thunder rumbling]

02:47.760 --> 02:50.560
[TV reporter]  The ceremonial guard
awaited Mr. Kennedy's arrival.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.760
It has pleased the French
that he came to Paris

02:52.840 --> 02:54.840
before going to Vienna
to meet Mr. Khrushchev...

02:54.920 --> 02:59.000
When is it, do you think,
if one's committed to a life of honesty,

02:59.080 --> 03:02.200
that one must start calling
oneself "middle-aged"?

03:02.760 --> 03:06.000
Oh, stop it. You're still a young girl!

03:06.080 --> 03:08.280
I caught sight of myself
in a mirror today.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.200
[door opens]

03:09.280 --> 03:10.680
I looked like an old woman.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.880
You haven't even finished
having children yet.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.080
True.

03:15.160 --> 03:19.160
So, finish your family,
let the first one go to school,

03:19.240 --> 03:21.360
and then let's talk about
being middle-aged.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.920
That won't be middle-aged,
that'll be ancient.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.880
[TV reporter]
Here he is arriving in Paris...

03:25.960 --> 03:27.840
-[static noise]
-[Elizabeth] Oh... no, no!

03:27.920 --> 03:30.080
-[Queen Mother] Oh, not again!
-[Elizabeth sighs]

03:31.800 --> 03:33.840
-Mummy! Be careful.
-President...

03:33.920 --> 03:35.560
No, stop it! It's rented.

03:35.640 --> 03:36.640
[Elizabeth] Mu--

03:38.000 --> 03:40.240
-[static noise continues]
-[Elizabeth tutting] No.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.160
Oh no, yes, you've got it. Well done.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.080
-[voices on TV]
-This macaroni and cheese is heavenly.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.600
[TV reporter]  ...to visit the faculty
of medicine in Paris.

03:48.680 --> 03:50.240
This whole weekend has been heavenly.

03:50.320 --> 03:51.560
It will be the first meeting...

03:51.640 --> 03:53.720
Sadly, I have to leave in the morning.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.240
-Whatever for?
-They're coming to dinner.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.960
-[Queen Mother] The Kennedys?
-After Vienna with Khrushchev, then Paris,

04:01.040 --> 04:02.240
they're coming to London.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.560
So we're having an informal dinner
at Buckingham Palace.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.960
During the brief stay in Paris...

04:06.040 --> 04:09.080
[Queen Mother] She's so young. I always
thought she was the same age as you.

04:09.160 --> 04:10.440
[Elizabeth] She is.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.120
...a banquet at the Élysée Palace.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.720
-[TV static noise]
-Oh... No!

04:15.160 --> 04:16.160
Thank you.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.920
[Elizabeth] Oh, no, look, there she is.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.839
...was talking about the charm
and elegance

04:21.920 --> 04:23.920
of Mr. Kennedy's wife Jackie.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.520
Jackie, in fact, often stole the picture.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.320
[Jackie speaking French]

04:33.520 --> 04:35.360
[Queen Mother]
Oh, she is pretty, isn't she?

04:37.080 --> 04:38.280
Yes.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.760
[crickets chirping]

05:58.200 --> 06:01.120
[Soviet national anthem plays]

06:17.240 --> 06:18.960
[car door opens]

06:22.200 --> 06:24.400
[national anthem continues]

06:38.640 --> 06:41.920
[Macmillan]  One overriding item
on the agenda today, ma'am.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.800
Ghana.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.280
And our continued concern

06:45.360 --> 06:47.760
for Nkrumah's growing hostility
to the West.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.440
You feel that he's drifting
from the Commonwealth?

06:50.520 --> 06:53.040
Not so much drifting
as bolting for the door.

06:53.120 --> 06:54.480
Into whose arms?

06:55.760 --> 06:57.080
The Russians', ma'am.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.640
[Macmillan] Yesterday,
he received Brezhnev in Accra.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.720
Brezhnev?

07:02.800 --> 07:04.640
The chairman of the Soviet Presidium,

07:04.720 --> 07:08.160
who flew to Ghana for talks about
Nkrumah's precious dam project?

07:08.240 --> 07:10.080
-The Volta Dam.
-Yes, ma'am.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.920
But I thought Nkrumah had been talking
to the Americans about that.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.280
He had been,
but Russia sees this as an opportunity

07:16.360 --> 07:18.800
to outbid the Americans,
get a foothold in Africa,

07:18.880 --> 07:21.080
in an attempt to turn
the whole continent red.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.080
Well, shouldn't we ask the Americans
to improve their offer?

07:25.160 --> 07:27.440
I will certainly speak
to President Kennedy

07:27.520 --> 07:29.400
-as soon as he arrives in London.
-Oh, good.

07:30.400 --> 07:34.520
-Following his great triumph in Paris.
-[Macmillan] Indeed.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.600
I thought de Gaulle didn't care
for Mr. Kennedy.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.920
Oh, he doesn't! Personally or politically.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.480
-So what turned it all around?
-The First Lady, ma'am.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.560
-Why? What did she do?
-Dazzled  le tout  Paris.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.960
Had President de Gaulle
eating out of her hand.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.080
[Elizabeth scoffs]

07:51.160 --> 07:54.960
-How on earth did she do that?
-By speaking French fluently.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.560
Yes, we can all do that.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.920
And by debating with local philosophers
and intellectuals

08:00.000 --> 08:03.640
until all anti-American sentiment
simply evaporated.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.240
[Elizabeth] I suppose she is pretty.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.360
[bell rings]

08:07.440 --> 08:08.840
And they are French.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.920
She's also a formidably bright woman
in her own right,

08:12.000 --> 08:13.280
having studied at the Sorbonne

08:13.360 --> 08:16.760
and the prestigious
École Libre des Sciences Politiques.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.880
"The most glamorous and intelligent
woman on earth." [laughs]

08:21.560 --> 08:23.600
-[door opens]
-So they say.

08:25.560 --> 08:29.920
And now she's coming to London,
so we'd better put our best foot forward,

08:30.000 --> 08:31.480
hadn't we, Prime Minister?

08:32.159 --> 08:33.520
Your Majesty.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.919
[footsteps]

08:37.000 --> 08:40.600
Always important, I think,
when choosing a gown

08:40.679 --> 08:45.080
is to ask oneself what precisely
one wants to feel when wearing it.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.200
Mm.

08:47.280 --> 08:51.440
I just think that one doesn't want
to feel... second best.

08:51.520 --> 08:56.240
Quite. Especially if one is very much
the senior of the two individuals.

08:56.320 --> 08:59.320
-Now, now.
-In terms of rank, ma'am, not age.

09:00.320 --> 09:03.440
To that end I have something
quite specific in mind.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.840
Mrs. Kennedy may have dazzled in Paris,

09:06.920 --> 09:09.280
but let's not forget France is a republic.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.520
This is a monarchy.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.480
And if you've got it, flaunt it, I say.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.120
-[exhales]
-[claps]

09:31.880 --> 09:32.720
[Elizabeth groans]

09:32.800 --> 09:35.840
I had a look at the seating plan
for dinner and I couldn't help noticing...

09:35.920 --> 09:38.000
-[Bobo] Breathe in, ma'am.
-[Philip gargles]

09:38.080 --> 09:39.000
[Bobo] Just a bit more.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.160
[Philip]
You gave Mrs. Kennedy to Uncle Dickie.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.960
-[Bobo] There.
-Yes, I did. At his request.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.640
He's been badgering me for weeks.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.280
As, incidentally, has your brother-in-law.

09:48.360 --> 09:49.520
-Berthold?
-Yes.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.600
The rascal.

09:50.680 --> 09:53.680
Not to mention our own Prime Minister
and the American ambassador.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.160
[Philip] Well, well, well.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.760
[Elizabeth] All desperate to sit next
to the First Lady.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.960
I could let it out a bit, ma'am.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.840
-No.
-[Philip] What if I'm requesting her too?

10:05.920 --> 10:08.880
-[Elizabeth] I put you next to Theodora.
-She's my sister.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.960
[Elizabeth]
Yes, whom you haven't seen in years.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.040
No, she's still my sister
and this is, oh, you know...

10:14.120 --> 10:16.040
No. I don't know.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.240
Her!

10:17.920 --> 10:21.480
Anyway, in terms of protocol,
isn't it my right, as your husband,

10:21.560 --> 10:23.480
to sit next
to the most senior female there?

10:23.560 --> 10:26.000
It's true. At a state dinner
you could've expected to sit

10:26.080 --> 10:29.280
next to the most senior female guest,
but on this occasion,

10:29.360 --> 10:33.320
Downing Street have asked us...
begged us, not to make it a state dinner.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.400
[Philip] Why?

10:34.480 --> 10:36.480
So as not to put
French noses out of joint.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.680
[Philip] What's it got to do
with the bloody French?

10:38.760 --> 10:41.560
Well, apparently de Gaulle
will resist us joining the EEC

10:41.640 --> 10:44.120
if he thinks
we're too close to the Americans.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.920
-So it's a small, informal dinner.
-[Philip] Well, fine.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.160
-Then it's a free-for-all seating-wise.
-[Elizabeth] Yes, I suppose it is.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.680
In which case,
I could move Dickie next to my sister

10:52.760 --> 10:55.560
and put myself next to the First Lady.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.360
[Elizabeth] If you must.

10:57.440 --> 10:58.760
[Philip sniffs] Oh, well.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.800
I must.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.280
[sighs]

11:07.160 --> 11:08.000

11:08.080 --> 11:11.080

-[cheering]

11:13.800 --> 11:16.240

11:16.320 --> 11:18.120
[sirens continue]

11:21.440 --> 11:22.880
[man] Thank you, gentlemen.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.560
And you!

11:26.640 --> 11:29.200
[party chatter]

11:31.600 --> 11:32.840
[glasses clink]

11:35.200 --> 11:38.000
The President and First Lady
are arriving, ma'am.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.080
Oh.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.440
There you are. [laughs]

11:44.800 --> 11:47.320
[frantic footsteps]

11:51.720 --> 11:54.760
Is it possible to think you could be
marginally less excited?

11:54.840 --> 11:56.040
No.

11:59.560 --> 12:00.760
Thank you very much.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.840
[Elizabeth]
Porchey, what on earth is going on?

12:04.600 --> 12:05.960
They've all gone mad.

12:07.640 --> 12:08.600
[guest] Here they come!

12:13.480 --> 12:15.760
[excited chatter]

12:17.920 --> 12:20.680
[man] Madam First Lady,
welcome to Buckingham Palace.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.560
-[Jackie] Thank you.
-[man] Mr. President.

12:22.640 --> 12:23.600
[JFK] Hello.

12:23.680 --> 12:26.160
[man] Her Majesty's waiting for you
in the Blue Drawing Room.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.600
[smacks hands]

12:30.680 --> 12:33.400
-There's a brief reception before dinner.
-[JFK] Fantastic.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.120
[Elizabeth] It's mass hysteria.
What extraordinary behavior.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.560
[Porchey] Quite extraordinary.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.360
-Ma'am.
-Thank you.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.560
Darling!

12:43.600 --> 12:44.640
For goodness' sake.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.720
-Come on, it's like royalty.
-Oh. Very funny.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.360
[footsteps approaching]

12:58.960 --> 13:00.280
[Philip] Gosh.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.480
President first, President first.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.160
Your Majesty.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.080
-No curtsy.
-No curtsy.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.280
-Mrs. Kennedy.
-Your Grace.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.920
[tuts] Your Royal Highness.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.880
Mrs. Kennedy.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.440
Good evening, Your Royal Majesty.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.600
Oh, dear.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.160
[whispers] Oh, for goodness' sake.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.680
Mr. President.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.120
-Mr. President.
-Your Grace.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.280
-Did they not get the protocol sheet?
-Yes!

13:29.360 --> 13:31.520
He obviously didn't read it.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.360
Yes, well. Shall we?

13:34.440 --> 13:35.560
Uh...

13:35.640 --> 13:37.000
Jackie.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.880
-Where do you think she's going?
-Lord knows.

13:43.440 --> 13:46.240
[Elizabeth] Mrs. Kennedy.
I believe you know our Prime Minister...

13:46.320 --> 13:49.280
[sighs] I feel like that went wrong
in about 10,000 different ways.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.720
I've seen worse. Though I'm not sure when.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.400
[both laugh]

13:54.480 --> 13:56.800
-[Philip] Drink?
-Please.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.760
-[sighs] Sorry, sir.
-Bloody shambles.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.920
Hmm.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.720
[busy chatter]

14:11.280 --> 14:12.440
[Jackie and Philip laugh]

14:12.520 --> 14:14.120
[Macmillan] My heart goes out to him.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.960
The word is that, behind closed doors
in Vienna, Khrushchev humiliated him,

14:19.040 --> 14:21.680
ran rings round him,
treated him like a little boy.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.600
-[Macmillan] No wonder the Cold War...
-[Jackie giggles]

14:24.680 --> 14:27.320
[speech muffles]

14:33.240 --> 14:34.680
[Jackie laughs]

14:34.760 --> 14:38.160
Sensuality... We won't go there! [laughs]

14:38.800 --> 14:41.200
[Jackie] No, we won't. [laughs]

14:43.760 --> 14:46.600
[Philip laughing]

14:46.680 --> 14:49.800
-[Jackie laughing]
-[Philip] Oh, stop it. [laughs]

14:55.440 --> 14:58.000
-Ah.
-So, how was she?

14:58.800 --> 15:01.360
Oh, terrific. She's divine.

15:01.440 --> 15:04.280
-Is she?
-And frightfully clever.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.360
Yes.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.120
What are you doing?

15:08.200 --> 15:10.320
-She wants a tour of the place.
-Does she?

15:10.400 --> 15:12.720
-Well, then I'll do it.
-No, it's all right, she asked me.

15:12.800 --> 15:16.760
No. It's my house. So I'll do it.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.520
[Elizabeth] Mrs. Kennedy.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.120
[JFK] Are you OK there?

15:25.840 --> 15:28.800
I hope my wife isn't, uh,
causing too much trouble.

15:30.920 --> 15:34.280
You do know
you're the luckiest man on earth?

15:36.480 --> 15:37.560
Yes.

15:41.520 --> 15:44.280
Although people keep telling me
the same thing.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.000
[laughs]

15:47.960 --> 15:49.080
Sure.

15:49.800 --> 15:50.960
Where are they going?

15:51.640 --> 15:53.760
I've absolutely no idea.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.080
[Elizabeth] Now, this is the Throne Room.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.600
In the early years
of Queen Victoria's reign,

16:00.680 --> 16:03.240
various balls and concerts were held here,

16:03.320 --> 16:06.000
but now it's principally used
for receptions,

16:06.080 --> 16:08.840
investitures and the taking
of royal wedding photographs.

16:14.680 --> 16:16.120
Shall we?

16:16.760 --> 16:19.320
[Elizabeth]
Now, this is the Picture Gallery.

16:19.400 --> 16:22.160
This is my
great-great-great-great-grandfather,

16:22.240 --> 16:26.520
George III, and he bought
Buckingham House in 1761

16:26.600 --> 16:28.960
for his wife, Queen Charlotte.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.560
Who's this?

16:30.640 --> 16:34.000
[Elizabeth]
Ah. That's one of the Pitts. The Younger.

16:35.280 --> 16:39.800
Known for something that's always rather
endeared me to him: crippling shyness.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.720
Apparently, he could barely
look people in the eye.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.120
And yet he became our prime minister.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.720
I quite understand.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.920
I'm also a shy person by nature.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.320
This leads to our private apartments.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.880
It's a shortcut.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.520
This is about as private as it gets
in this place.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.640
It's where one feels most comfortable.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.480
Oh, I quite understand.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.040
You have to have somewhere to escape to.

17:23.079 --> 17:26.720
I've often wondered how someone
who hates attention as much as I do

17:26.800 --> 17:29.400
ended up in a goldfish bowl
like the White House.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.000
But I realize there's actually
a perverse logic

17:34.080 --> 17:37.120
to a cripplingly shy person
ending up in this position.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.680
Oh, you'll have to explain that one to me.

17:39.760 --> 17:43.280
Well, a shy person will seek out
someone strong to protect them.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.360
Yes. I'm with you so far.

17:46.440 --> 17:51.080
And a strong character's often one
who enjoys public life.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.560
Who thrives on it.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.880
And then, before you know it,
the very person you've turned to

17:56.960 --> 18:00.320
in order to protect you
is the very reason you are exposed.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.280
Jack's idea of heaven is a crowd.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.000
Campaigning, fund-raising, speechmaking.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.320
That's when he comes alive.

18:10.400 --> 18:15.280
He'd far sooner speak to 10,000 people
under the glare of spotlights

18:15.360 --> 18:18.800
than be alone... with me.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.000
And what's your idea of heaven?

18:28.080 --> 18:32.200
I like my own company.
And to be alone in the countryside.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.480
And where do you go?

18:34.560 --> 18:37.400
A farm, Glen Ora, about an hour
from Washington.

18:37.480 --> 18:38.800
Maryland?

18:39.560 --> 18:41.000
-Virginia.
-[Elizabeth] Oh, yes.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.360
-[dogs barking]
-[distant hushing]

18:44.440 --> 18:45.280
Ah.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.320
-[doors opening]
-[dog whimpers]

18:47.400 --> 18:49.120
-Hello, Stuart.
-Ma'am.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.200
-[gasps] They're eating.
-Yes, ma'am.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.400
Oh, goodness! [laughs]

18:53.480 --> 18:57.120
-Hello, puppies.
-[Jackie gasps] Hello, what's your name?

18:57.200 --> 18:58.840
-[dog whines]
-Well, that's Sugar.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.800
[Elizabeth gasps]
And these are her puppies.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.680
Come here, come here, little one.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.600
-Whiskey and Sherry.
-[Jackie] Hello.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.200
-[dog barks]
-Oh, you're very clever to be cautious.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.240
[Jackie laughs]

19:10.320 --> 19:13.200
Oh, it's really one of the great paradoxes
of being in a position

19:13.280 --> 19:16.120
where I have to talk
to a great many people,

19:16.720 --> 19:19.000
but deep down, I'm happiest with animals.

19:19.520 --> 19:20.960
That makes two of us.

19:23.240 --> 19:27.120
[Jackie] I always think my sister
would've made, if not the better,

19:27.200 --> 19:29.120
the more natural First Lady.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.920
-Oh, mine too. A born queen.
-[Jackie laughs]

19:32.960 --> 19:36.160
And the greatest of British queens.
In her own mind, anyway.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.280
[laughs]

19:40.520 --> 19:41.400
Hmm.

19:44.120 --> 19:48.400
No, I liked her very much.
And I'd been all set to loathe her.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.720
But in the end, I was utterly charmed.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.280
-It's a timely reminder.
-Of what?

19:53.360 --> 19:56.240
Well, that people are
so rarely what they seem.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.600
Well, then I don't know
what Patrick was talking about.

19:58.680 --> 19:59.840
-Patrick?
-Plunket.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.360
-I saw him last night at  Tartuffe.
-Oh, is that a restaurant?

20:02.440 --> 20:05.440
[laughs] It's a play, dear.
A very famous French play.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.040
-Oh, I knew that.
-Did you?

20:07.120 --> 20:09.600
-[Elizabeth] Yes, it's a classic tragedy.
-[laughs] Farce.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.560
-[Elizabeth] By Pissarro.
-Molière.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.640
-Oh.
-Pissarro was a painter!

20:16.520 --> 20:18.880
When was the last time you even went
to the theater?

20:18.960 --> 20:20.360
-Or a gallery?
-[sighs]

20:20.440 --> 20:21.320
Or even read a book?

20:22.160 --> 20:23.200
Oh, you're a savage.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.840
Oh, thank you.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.320
[Elizabeth] What about Patrick?

20:27.080 --> 20:30.160
Well, Patrick had dinner
at the Radziwills' last week,

20:30.840 --> 20:33.640
where your new best friend, Mrs. Kennedy,
was also a guest.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.960
He called me this morning to tell me
some of the things

20:37.040 --> 20:39.280
-he'd overheard her say at dinner.
-[lighter clicks]

20:39.360 --> 20:40.640
Oh, what did she say?

20:40.720 --> 20:42.720
You'd have to ask Patrick.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.280
I must say, it did seem a little unkind.

20:45.920 --> 20:49.280
You know how reported speech
gets twisted in the re-telling.

20:49.360 --> 20:50.320
[horse neighs]

20:50.400 --> 20:52.200
I'm quite sure it was nothing.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.520
Don't worry!

20:57.440 --> 21:01.880
[military drumming]

21:01.960 --> 21:03.400
[drill commander]  General salute!

21:03.480 --> 21:06.960
-Present arms!
-[guns clicking]

21:08.240 --> 21:11.200
Shoulder arms!

21:12.880 --> 21:15.000
Order arms!

21:15.080 --> 21:16.080
[dog whines]

21:17.520 --> 21:19.320
[commander in distance] About turn!

21:19.400 --> 21:20.720
[dog whines]

21:22.080 --> 21:23.840
-[Elizabeth] Patrick.
-Your Majesty.

21:23.920 --> 21:24.760
[door shuts]

21:24.840 --> 21:26.440
[Elizabeth] It's so kind of you to come.

21:27.080 --> 21:28.560
[kisses]

21:29.160 --> 21:31.600
-It's really not far.
-Are you still just round the corner?

21:31.680 --> 21:33.120
-At Wellington Barracks?
-I am.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.280
And are you still traveling up
and down the country,

21:35.360 --> 21:37.560
recruiting for all the regiments
from the top schools?

21:37.640 --> 21:39.520
-That's me.
-[Elizabeth laughs]

21:42.000 --> 21:43.200
I gather...

21:44.360 --> 21:48.200
you saw the First Lady at dinner recently.

21:48.280 --> 21:50.360
-Who?
-Mrs. Kennedy.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.040
-Margaret mentioned it.
-Did she?

21:53.120 --> 21:54.600
Yes.

21:56.320 --> 21:57.440
So how was that?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.920
Pleasant enough. Uneventful.
[laughs nervously]

22:02.000 --> 22:05.200
-You know how it is at the Radziwills'.
-No, I don't.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.360
Well, the food's always good.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.320
Yes, well, I wasn't asking about the food.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.160
I'd like to know what was said.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.680
[Elizabeth] Patrick, we grew up together

22:17.760 --> 22:21.640
and we've always had a very frank
and a very open relationship.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.560
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Elizabeth] Yes, so...

22:23.640 --> 22:26.000
Let's not break the habit of a lifetime.

22:29.520 --> 22:30.640
All right.

22:32.520 --> 22:35.080
What I overheard the First Lady say...

22:35.960 --> 22:38.920
[stutters] and I should mention,
I was several places along the table.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.640
-It's possible that I misheard.
-Yes.

22:43.360 --> 22:47.280
Was that she found Buckingham Palace

22:47.360 --> 22:49.760
second-rate, dilapidated and sad.
[exhales]

22:50.600 --> 22:53.840
Like a neglected provincial hotel.

22:53.920 --> 22:59.640
And that one came away
with a sense of a tired institution

22:59.720 --> 23:02.120
without a place in the modern world.

23:05.720 --> 23:06.960
I see.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.560
And did she have anything
to say about me?

23:17.640 --> 23:19.200
-Oh, Lilibet.
-Patrick!

23:19.280 --> 23:21.320
I was at the other end of the table, I...

23:27.320 --> 23:29.880
But the words I think I overheard were...

23:33.760 --> 23:38.200
that in our head of state,
we had a middle-aged woman...

23:39.080 --> 23:45.040
so incurious, unintelligent
and unremarkable...

23:47.840 --> 23:51.080
that Britain's new reduced place
in the world was not a surprise,

23:51.160 --> 23:52.840
but an inevitability.

24:04.720 --> 24:05.720
[exhales]

24:07.440 --> 24:08.640
Well...

24:11.680 --> 24:13.760
We must have her again soon.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.680
[distant ticking]

24:28.240 --> 24:30.720
-[cogs whirring]
-[teleprinter clicking]

24:53.560 --> 24:55.680
[Macmillan]
Bad news, I'm afraid. Worse than bad.

24:55.760 --> 25:00.280
Regarding Nkrumah's Volta Dam project.
President Kennedy's pulled out.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.240
Why?

25:03.320 --> 25:05.120
American involvement was conditional

25:05.200 --> 25:07.520
upon Ghana having severed all ties
with the Russians.

25:07.600 --> 25:11.880
Turns out Nkrumah was in Moscow
yesterday to receive the Order of Lenin,

25:11.960 --> 25:13.280
highest military honor.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.880
From Khrushchev himself.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.000
-And what's the next step?
-I wish I knew.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.240
I wish I had an ace up my sleeve.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.360
The way President Kennedy
had his First Lady in Paris?

25:37.760 --> 25:39.160
Why don't you send me?

25:42.760 --> 25:43.640
Where?

25:45.200 --> 25:48.320
To Ghana. On what would be seen
as a personal trip.

25:48.400 --> 25:49.400
Absolutely not.

25:49.480 --> 25:52.720
-That would be out of the question, ma'am.
-Why?

25:52.800 --> 25:55.440
A visit from the Crown to Ghana
would be seen as a huge compliment.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.600
Too great a compliment.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.320
It would be singling out Ghana
as a preferred nation.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.520
And doing so, we risk alienating
Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Tanganyika.

26:02.600 --> 26:05.040
But surely, by singling out Ghana,
that might be just the thing

26:05.120 --> 26:07.600
to keep Nkrumah away from the Russians
and in the Commonwealth.

26:07.680 --> 26:09.280
Perhaps, but as queen, you cannot be seen

26:09.360 --> 26:11.320
to be engaging
in the dirty business of politics!

26:11.400 --> 26:12.760
But as head of the Commonwealth,

26:12.840 --> 26:14.640
can I not be permitted just once
to defend it?

26:14.720 --> 26:16.240
[Macmillan] Your Majesty.

26:17.200 --> 26:21.000
It would be unsafe.
It would be provocative.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.160
It would be, in my view,

26:25.240 --> 26:29.040
a profound misjudgment
to get on that plane.

26:33.960 --> 26:37.640
[plane engine roars]

26:43.520 --> 26:47.360
"The trip is impossible
to justify from any angle.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.120
It is unethical, unconstitutional,

26:49.200 --> 26:51.600
and indefensible that the Queen
should be going at all."

26:51.680 --> 26:53.040
[newspaper slams]

26:53.120 --> 26:55.640
Well, what would you have me do?
Nothing?

26:55.720 --> 26:58.200
[Philip] I certainly wouldn't have you
get into a chess match

26:58.280 --> 27:00.240
-with a wily operator like Nkrumah.
-[scoffs]

27:00.320 --> 27:01.640
You're just being cynical.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.080
[Philip] And you're being naive!

27:04.120 --> 27:07.160
When you last met him,
Nkrumah was just... Nkrumah.

27:07.240 --> 27:10.720
Now he's The Lion of Africa, playing
the Soviets off against the Americans,

27:10.800 --> 27:13.880
and you're a lamb
the lion will have for lunch.

27:13.960 --> 27:14.800
[plane rattling]

27:14.880 --> 27:16.560
The best thing you can do is stay at home

27:16.640 --> 27:18.800
-and be what you're supposed to be.
-[pulls curtain]

27:18.880 --> 27:21.400
-A puppet?
-A constitutional monarch!

27:21.480 --> 27:23.080
-A puppet.
-If you like.

27:24.120 --> 27:27.720
Well, that's the whole point.
I don't like.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.200
[plane soaring]

27:43.040 --> 27:45.480
[man] Sir? She's here.

[band playing British national anthem]

28:31.800 --> 28:34.400
[Elizabeth] Thank you. They're lovely.

28:42.240 --> 28:43.600
Shall we, ma'am?

28:45.720 --> 28:47.080
-Stop.
-Stop.

28:47.160 --> 28:50.480
Uh, one moment, please, ma'am.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.400
Yes.

28:52.120 --> 28:53.360
Reporters.

28:55.680 --> 28:58.000
-[camera shutters click]
-[Philip] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:59.840 --> 29:06.120
[speaking in Akan]

29:09.400 --> 29:14.080
[in English] Your Majesty,
Ghana welcomes you. Humbly.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.080
Yes.

29:15.160 --> 29:17.400
-[film camera whirring]
-[camera shutters clicking]

29:17.480 --> 29:19.160
-We're very happy to be here.
-Of course.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.600
[man] Back, back, back, back, back. Back!

29:26.640 --> 29:27.600
Ready?

29:29.560 --> 29:31.840
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-[camera winding]

29:33.640 --> 29:35.600
-[Elizabeth] Thank you.
-[distant chatter]

29:35.680 --> 29:39.280
Well, you've given him
the photo he wanted.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.720
That'll be on the front page
of every African newspaper,

29:41.800 --> 29:44.520
making every other African leader
choke with jealousy.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.320
Yes, well, as long as it does the trick.

29:46.400 --> 29:50.040
[drums playing]

29:52.160 --> 29:55.640
[phone ringing]

29:56.360 --> 29:59.680
Adeane here. Put him through.

30:00.240 --> 30:02.240
-I have a secure line to Ghana.
-[woman] Yes, sir.

30:02.320 --> 30:03.280
[typewriters click]

30:03.360 --> 30:06.800
[Douglas-Home] I thought he'd agreed
to suspend all contact with the Soviets.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.040
-[man 1] Apparently not.
-[man 2] Ready for you, sir.

30:09.120 --> 30:10.640
[man 2] Gentlemen? Thank you.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.320
[Michael] Thank you.

30:21.240 --> 30:22.520
Out.

30:22.880 --> 30:23.880
Hello?

30:26.400 --> 30:27.400
Your Majesty.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.000
Prime Minister.

30:29.080 --> 30:32.400
I've just received confirmation that
a team of international engineers

30:32.480 --> 30:35.160
has arrived in Ghana to begin
work on Nkrumah's dam.

30:35.240 --> 30:39.360
Well...
I'd say that's good news, isn't it?

30:39.960 --> 30:42.080
We encouraged the Americans
to go back to Nkrumah.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.320
Soviet engineers, ma'am.

30:44.080 --> 30:46.160
It appears Nkrumah has been playing us

30:46.240 --> 30:47.960
-all off against one another.
-[inhales]

30:48.040 --> 30:49.880
-What?
-Leading us a merry dance.

30:49.960 --> 30:52.520
I'm afraid you've been used, ma'am.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.560
Just as we'd feared.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.680
[knocking]

31:00.760 --> 31:02.480
[Philip] Elizabeth! What's happened?

31:05.080 --> 31:06.760
Evening, sir. Martin.

31:07.800 --> 31:08.920
Ah! Ah! Ah!

31:09.000 --> 31:10.560
I wouldn't, if I were you.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.120
Sir?

31:13.160 --> 31:15.040
[Philip] She's asked to be alone.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.920
She says she's thinking.

31:32.560 --> 31:33.560
[sighs]

[party chatter continues]

31:55.320 --> 31:56.680

31:59.760 --> 32:00.880
Ma'am.

32:01.400 --> 32:02.760
[camera shutter clicks]

32:02.840 --> 32:03.960
[Philip] What's going on?

32:05.760 --> 32:06.960
What are you doing?

32:08.640 --> 32:09.720
[Philip] Elizabeth?

32:17.040 --> 32:18.720
[phone receiver dings]

32:18.800 --> 32:20.600
Yes, this is Colonel Charteris.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.880
We have Martin Charteris on the telephone.

32:22.960 --> 32:26.240
A situation is developing in Ghana. Hello?

32:26.320 --> 32:28.840
[loud chatter]

32:38.160 --> 32:39.000
[clears throat]

32:45.600 --> 32:47.880
[Philip] What are you doing? Elizabeth?

32:57.000 --> 33:00.320
I think we both understand
the significance of this moment.

33:01.600 --> 33:06.000
Yes. But do we understand the terms?

33:09.600 --> 33:11.960
They appear to be in some kind
of negotiation.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.040
-What kind of negotiation?
-Get her out of there!

33:14.560 --> 33:15.720
[Nkrumah laughs]

33:16.800 --> 33:18.160
Your Majesty?

33:20.920 --> 33:21.920
[crowd gasps]

33:22.000 --> 33:23.280
Oh, Lord!

33:23.360 --> 33:24.400
What's going on?

33:30.040 --> 33:32.240
He's taken her hand.

33:32.320 --> 33:33.480
Two, three, four!

33:33.560 --> 33:35.080
[music plays]

33:35.160 --> 33:37.280
[applause continues]

33:49.040 --> 33:50.240
[inhales deeply]

33:50.320 --> 33:52.040
They're... dancing.

33:52.120 --> 33:53.960
[faint music over phone]

33:54.040 --> 33:55.880
Our Queen is dancing, sir.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.560
With an African.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.280
What? Was this agreed?

34:01.360 --> 34:02.440
[Bishop] Was this agreed?

34:02.520 --> 34:04.320
This was definitely not agreed.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.240
-What are they doing?
-What are they doing?

34:07.760 --> 34:09.280
Hard to say.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.360
I believe it's the foxtrot.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.360
The foxtrot, sir.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.800
[camera shutters clicking]

34:50.159 --> 34:52.000
[chattering]

34:55.840 --> 34:57.000
[music concludes]

34:57.080 --> 35:00.640
[Bobby Kennedy] Ladies and gentlemen,
the man I am proud to call

35:00.720 --> 35:03.000
the 35th President of the United States,

35:03.080 --> 35:07.840
but even more proud to call my brother,

35:07.920 --> 35:09.240
John F. Kennedy.

35:09.320 --> 35:10.840
[applause]

35:13.800 --> 35:15.320
[JFK] Thank you, Bobby.

35:20.760 --> 35:23.680
What is it to be an American today?

35:25.120 --> 35:28.720
Prosperous, powerful, privileged.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.440
Certainly.

35:32.480 --> 35:36.040
And yet, it is also troubling.

35:37.080 --> 35:41.720
I look around me and find our people
divided as never before.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.240
Indeed, as at no time since our Civil War.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.040
There has been a change, a slippage,

35:49.120 --> 35:52.520
in our moral
and our intellectual strength.

35:52.600 --> 35:57.440
Blight has descended on
our regulatory agencies and a dry rot,

35:57.520 --> 36:01.880
beginning in Washington,
is seeping into every corner of America.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.080
Too many of us have lost our way,

36:05.160 --> 36:08.640
our will and our sense
of historic purpose.

36:09.240 --> 36:14.280
It is time for a renewal,
a new generation of leadership,

36:14.360 --> 36:18.000
healing leadership,
but we cannot do it alone,

36:18.440 --> 36:23.600
and so I am asking each of you
to be pioneers in this renewal,

36:23.680 --> 36:28.360
in this healing, in the reclaiming
of great American values:

36:28.440 --> 36:31.840
freedom, tolerance
and equality of opportunity.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.600
Then we can claim our position

36:34.680 --> 36:38.680
and responsibilities
as leaders of a truly free world.

36:38.760 --> 36:42.640
God bless you all, and God bless
the United States of America!

36:42.720 --> 36:46.640
-[applause]
-[cheering]

36:55.040 --> 36:56.320
[JFK] Thank you. Thank you.

37:00.360 --> 37:01.320
Thanks.

37:04.120 --> 37:06.240
-[man] Thank you, sir.
-[Bobby] Fantastic.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.680
You've made this evening worthwhile.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.600
[laughs]

37:13.720 --> 37:15.640
-Ladies, if you'd like to step over here.
-Sure.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.360
[woman laughs]

37:23.240 --> 37:25.040
[footsteps]

37:25.120 --> 37:28.480
[man on TV]  When the British royal family
visits a former colony,

37:28.560 --> 37:31.320
it doesn't normally make news in the US.

37:31.400 --> 37:34.480
But when Queen Elizabeth
dances with a former subject...

37:34.560 --> 37:35.880
What's up, honey?

37:35.960 --> 37:39.920
...a white monarch with an African
leader, the world pays attention.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.520
And so too did Ghanaian leader
President Nkrumah himself.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.480
Awed by the gesture, Nkrumah...

37:46.560 --> 37:49.040
I'm going to Glen Ora
with the kids in the morning.

37:49.920 --> 37:52.720
-It's not the weekend yet.
-...that he was fast becoming allies...

37:52.800 --> 37:55.760
It's Wednesday.
It's weekend enough for me.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.160
Don't be like that.

37:59.680 --> 38:02.560
Don't you take away my dignity
and then tell me how to be.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.720
I just wanted to thank you, that's all.

38:06.080 --> 38:09.160
For the second time in recent weeks,
you've been instrumental

38:09.240 --> 38:12.040
in changing a significant matter
of foreign policy.

38:14.520 --> 38:18.720
And an African state that was fast running
into the arms of the Communists

38:18.800 --> 38:21.040
has been turned around
and kept in the West.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.280
[scoffs]

38:23.280 --> 38:26.400
-Oh. What does that have to do with me?
-[exhales]

38:26.480 --> 38:28.600
Dreary Queen Thick-Ankles?

38:30.200 --> 38:32.280
-[Jackie] What?
-Her Majestic Dullness?

38:33.160 --> 38:35.360
The Incurious Crown?

38:35.440 --> 38:39.560
Apparently, just some of the things you
said about her at a dinner in London,

38:39.640 --> 38:43.640
which then got back to Queen Elizabeth
and, it seems, spurred her on.

38:44.800 --> 38:49.000
Without those insults, she wouldn't have
defied a Cabinet, risked her reputation

38:49.080 --> 38:50.880
and gone to Ghana, against all advice,

38:50.960 --> 38:54.400
to bring President Nkrumah
back on side, but she did.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.720
Pulled off some incredible stunt
with a dance.

38:58.800 --> 39:02.080
-And it's all thanks to you.
-They're ready for you.

39:02.960 --> 39:06.640
Relax. It's not like
you'll run into her in Glen Ora.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.680
[Jackie] Not Glen Ora, no.

39:09.440 --> 39:13.640
But I am due back in London on my way
back from India and Pakistan.

39:13.720 --> 39:17.880
Then my advice would be
don't go to Buckingham Palace.

39:19.120 --> 39:22.680
-Sorry. "The provincial hotel." [laughs]
-[Bobby] It's not so easy.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.880
Her sister set up a lunch
last time we were in town.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.160
[JFK] Oh?

39:27.240 --> 39:28.480
Oh, that should be fun.

39:29.360 --> 39:33.080
Catfight!
I'll look forward to a full report.

39:34.040 --> 39:35.640
Come on, Bobby.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.920
[pilot]  We will shortly be reaching
a cruising altitude of 25,000 feet

39:51.000 --> 39:54.600
and I'm pleased to say that we anticipate
clear and calm conditions

39:54.680 --> 39:57.040
for the rest of our flight to London.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.080
Your Majesty, some more international
reactions to the Ghana trip.

40:03.320 --> 40:07.160
-Positive or negative?
-Overwhelmingly positive, ma'am.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.000
Well, just a quick look, then.

40:16.880 --> 40:18.640
[Michael] So...

40:19.040 --> 40:21.720
The New York Times  calls it

40:21.800 --> 40:23.880
"shrewd strategic maneuvering,

40:23.960 --> 40:27.480
an example of impeccable
political brinkmanship."

40:27.560 --> 40:28.960
The Australian papers are very impressed

40:29.040 --> 40:30.760
with your commitment
to the Commonwealth

40:30.840 --> 40:35.720
and  The Illustrated London News  call it
"an outstanding personal success."

40:35.800 --> 40:37.160
[Elizabeth] Hmm.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.760
Gloating doesn't suit you.

40:40.480 --> 40:44.680
The Ghanaian press
are calling you a socialist.

40:44.760 --> 40:45.800
Hmm!

40:45.880 --> 40:47.760
-Goodness!
-[Michael laughs]

40:47.840 --> 40:49.640
[Michael] One more thing.

40:49.720 --> 40:51.800
First Lady-- Mrs. Kennedy.

40:55.040 --> 40:56.040
What about her?

40:56.760 --> 40:57.600
[Michael] Um...

40:57.680 --> 41:00.600
Her office has written requesting
a private audience with Your Majesty

41:00.680 --> 41:02.640
prior to lunch on the 28th of March.

41:03.600 --> 41:04.720
Whatever for?

41:04.800 --> 41:06.600
Um, they didn't say.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.800
-Where's the lunch?
-Buckingham Palace, ma'am.

41:13.760 --> 41:17.360
Well, let's make the audience
Windsor Castle.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.800
[Elizabeth]
Sometimes only a fortress will do.

41:23.640 --> 41:25.640
Windsor Castle.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.520

41:52.000 --> 41:53.400
[commander] On the right, march!

42:00.040 --> 42:02.440
Make way for the Queen's Guard!

42:14.600 --> 42:16.040
[commander] Left, right, left...

42:16.120 --> 42:17.640
Good afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.480
This way, please.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.280
[commander in distance]
Left, right, left, right...

42:28.360 --> 42:29.920
This way, Mrs. Kennedy.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.200
[clock chiming]

42:41.880 --> 42:44.480
Mrs. Kennedy. This way, please.

42:59.480 --> 43:01.440
[man] Mrs. Kennedy, Your Majesty.

43:02.720 --> 43:06.160
Your Majesty.
Thank you for seeing me.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.080
Mrs. Kennedy.

43:12.120 --> 43:13.440
Do sit down.

43:17.960 --> 43:19.400
[Jackie] Thank you.

43:22.360 --> 43:24.040
[Jackie coughs]

43:24.120 --> 43:25.120
Shall we have tea?

43:30.360 --> 43:31.360
[teapots clinking]

43:32.400 --> 43:35.080
[tea pouring]

43:44.120 --> 43:48.440
I asked to speak to you in private
ahead of our lunch on Friday

43:48.520 --> 43:50.320
because I owe you an apology.

43:50.880 --> 43:51.960
Whatever for?

43:52.680 --> 43:55.160
I think we both know
the answer to that question.

43:59.640 --> 44:00.560
Thank you.

44:05.080 --> 44:07.360
[doors creak open]

44:07.440 --> 44:08.600
[doors close]

44:08.680 --> 44:12.400
At a social occasion,
shortly after our last visit,

44:12.480 --> 44:15.720
I... I made some comments,

44:15.800 --> 44:17.920
some foolish comments

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
which I believe got back to you.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.800
There really is no need for this.

44:23.400 --> 44:25.160
Reports that you'd said...

44:25.920 --> 44:29.000
certain things did get back to me.

44:29.680 --> 44:33.240
And I'll confess
to being momentarily surprised,

44:33.320 --> 44:36.040
since they in no way reflected
what I understood to be the spirit

44:36.120 --> 44:37.880
of our meeting.

44:37.960 --> 44:40.600
But in this job, I've learned,
as I'm sure you have too,

44:41.640 --> 44:43.200
not to take things too seriously.

44:43.280 --> 44:46.280
People say things
for all sorts of reasons,

44:46.360 --> 44:48.960
which get misquoted or misunderstood
and, before you know it,

44:49.040 --> 44:51.360
those words have turned
into something quite different

44:51.440 --> 44:54.480
and everyone's upset or up in arms.

44:55.680 --> 44:58.120
I'm quite sure that you meant
no harm, nor disrespect.

44:58.200 --> 45:02.840
After all, why would you?
We barely know one another.

45:02.920 --> 45:08.720
Still, it was inexcusable so I can't offer
an excuse but, if you'll allow me,

45:08.800 --> 45:11.080
I'd like to offer an explanation.

45:13.400 --> 45:14.960
Yes, of course.

45:15.640 --> 45:19.480
Last time we were in London,
Jack and I probably seemed,

45:19.560 --> 45:21.720
at least from the outside,
to be riding on a high.

45:21.800 --> 45:23.480
Yes, I should say so.

45:24.320 --> 45:26.960
The most celebrated
and most famous couple in the world.

45:27.040 --> 45:32.360
The truth is that I was still suffering
from post-natal problems

45:32.440 --> 45:36.320
after the birth of our son,
and Jack had his own health issues.

45:36.400 --> 45:40.280
To say we were strained
would be an understatement.

45:41.520 --> 45:43.160
So, when we got to Paris...

45:43.240 --> 45:44.080
[camera shutter clicks]

45:44.160 --> 45:46.040
...I don't mind telling you,

45:46.120 --> 45:48.320
I took some pleasure in shining there.

45:48.400 --> 45:51.200
Then, at the Élysée Palace...

45:51.280 --> 45:54.560
I am the man who accompanied
Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris...

45:54.640 --> 45:56.320
[laughing]

45:58.120 --> 45:59.400
[JFK]  I enjoyed it.

45:59.480 --> 46:02.640
[Jackie]  Jack didn't appreciate
being upstaged.

46:03.800 --> 46:06.640
-Behind closed doors...
-I can imagine.

46:10.240 --> 46:12.240
[Jackie]  There were other factors, too.

46:13.440 --> 46:14.720
Our doctor.

46:15.880 --> 46:21.120
Dr Jacobson routinely administers us
his "cocktails" before major trips.

46:21.200 --> 46:22.720
[pleasurable sigh]

46:22.800 --> 46:24.080
Vitamins.

46:27.200 --> 46:29.000
But other substances too.

46:31.560 --> 46:34.680
To help pep us up or...

46:36.000 --> 46:37.280
calm us down.

46:40.680 --> 46:43.720
On the occasion of that dinner,
he had given me something.

46:44.520 --> 46:46.440
A little... booster.

46:46.520 --> 46:49.880
-There were these beautiful paintings.
-I told him I needed cheering up.

46:49.960 --> 46:52.120
-[laughing]
-[chattering]

46:52.200 --> 46:54.080
But I guess it loosened my tongue.

46:54.160 --> 46:55.840
[laughing]

46:55.920 --> 46:59.400
And then I heard some of these
terrible things got back to you and...

46:59.480 --> 47:02.000
-[cork pops]
-[drinks pouring]

47:02.080 --> 47:04.840
I can't tell you how much distress
it's caused me.

47:06.680 --> 47:10.440
The idea that I might've
upset someone I admire so much.

47:11.480 --> 47:13.360
That's very kind of you to say.

47:14.200 --> 47:16.120
[Jackie] It's true.

47:16.200 --> 47:20.920
The way you do your job,
the way you cope with the pressure,

47:21.000 --> 47:24.120
the personal sacrifices you've made,

47:24.200 --> 47:28.040
not to mention
your composure and dignity.

47:30.320 --> 47:32.680
As a woman, it's so inspiring.

47:33.680 --> 47:35.160
And what you just did in Ghana.

47:36.600 --> 47:38.560
It was just extraordinary.

47:43.200 --> 47:48.240
[Elizabeth]  What I should've said
was that I didn't do very much in Ghana.

47:48.320 --> 47:51.160
I got on a plane and I went.

47:51.760 --> 47:52.960
And the only reason I went

47:53.040 --> 47:56.720
was because I felt utterly useless
in comparison to you.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.440
And I was trying to compete.

48:00.680 --> 48:05.760
And if anything, I owe you
a huge debt of gratitude.

48:07.640 --> 48:09.080
But I didn't.

48:10.440 --> 48:12.040
I just sat there.

48:13.360 --> 48:15.080
And I let her say her piece.

48:15.160 --> 48:18.360
-[Philip] And savored your victory.
-Yes.

48:19.160 --> 48:22.360
[Philip] And what do you want from me
now? A ticking-off?

48:22.440 --> 48:24.760
[Elizabeth] Well, don't you think
I'm deserving of one?

48:24.840 --> 48:28.080
-[Philip] No.
-But she was so broken.

48:28.760 --> 48:31.480
And fragile and lost.

48:32.640 --> 48:35.400
[sighs] You did exactly the right thing.

48:37.560 --> 48:40.800
She insulted you, all of us,
and you're not a saint.

48:40.880 --> 48:42.840
-No.
-We know that already.

48:43.880 --> 48:44.880
[kisses]

48:46.080 --> 48:48.840
There's ice in those veins
when there needs to be.

48:48.920 --> 48:49.920
Yes.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.240
Well, three cheers to that.

49:03.880 --> 49:04.800
[engine revving]

49:04.880 --> 49:06.880
[man] Last one, ma'am,
but she's a big heavy one.

49:06.960 --> 49:09.560
-[engine revs]
-[man] Right, pick up the slack.

49:09.640 --> 49:10.880
[Elizabeth] Yes.

49:11.920 --> 49:13.880
[man] That's it, you got it. Daniel!

49:13.960 --> 49:16.640
-[Elizabeth] No, it's caught.
-[man] Keep going up the hill.

49:22.760 --> 49:24.800
[car honks]

49:24.880 --> 49:28.080
-[car braking]
-[car door slams]

49:29.120 --> 49:30.840
-Ma'am.
-What is it?

49:30.920 --> 49:32.880
You're needed back at the house.

49:32.960 --> 49:33.960
Right.

49:38.840 --> 49:41.320
-[Daniel] What's going on?
-I dunno, lad.

49:41.400 --> 49:42.240
[car starts]

49:42.320 --> 49:43.800
Something's happened.

49:47.480 --> 49:49.520
[footman panting]

49:51.960 --> 49:52.960
Ma'am.

49:55.080 --> 49:58.160
[radio reporter]  There was absolute
pandemonium around the scene.

49:58.240 --> 50:01.240
People screamed and lay down
on the ground as shots were heard.

50:01.320 --> 50:06.120
Reporters saw President Kennedy lying
flat on his face on the seat of his car.

50:06.200 --> 50:07.800
Men and women were screaming.

50:07.880 --> 50:10.760
He saw blood on the President's head.

50:10.840 --> 50:13.640
This is all we have
here in Washington at this moment.

50:13.720 --> 50:16.960
And for the moment, I return you
to Radio Newsreel in London.

50:17.040 --> 50:18.240
[reporter 2]  Hello, London.

50:18.320 --> 50:21.440
I've just heard from Dallas
that the President is still alive

50:21.520 --> 50:23.640
but in critical condition.

50:23.720 --> 50:26.120
He was apparently shot in the head

50:26.200 --> 50:30.640
and the Governor of Texas,
Governor Connally, was shot in the chest.

50:30.720 --> 50:34.080
[news reader]  Mrs. Kennedy was weeping,
trying to hold up her husband's head,

50:34.160 --> 50:38.360
when the reporters reached the car
as it dashed toward the hospital.

50:38.440 --> 50:42.080
Vice President Lyndon Johnson
was in the car behind the President.

50:42.160 --> 50:46.000
Blood transfusions are
being given to President Kennedy.

50:46.080 --> 50:49.360
However, one of the two priests
called into the room

50:49.440 --> 50:52.400
has administered
the Last Sacrament of the Church

50:52.480 --> 50:54.280
to President Kennedy.

50:55.200 --> 50:58.280
Mrs. Kennedy
and Mrs. Connally are stunned,

50:58.360 --> 51:01.440
but they are at the bedsides
of their husbands.

51:10.440 --> 51:11.560
He's dead.

51:38.880 --> 51:40.080
[camera shutter clicks]

51:47.920 --> 51:50.640
[car doors opening]

51:50.720 --> 51:52.520
[news reader]  Late yesterday afternoon...

51:52.600 --> 51:54.640
Didn't you say how unhappy she was?

51:55.440 --> 51:56.720
In the marriage?

51:59.000 --> 52:01.400
-Yes.
-...accompanied the fallen President,

52:01.480 --> 52:04.280
-her clothes still...
-That's the thing about unhappiness.

52:04.360 --> 52:06.480
...of this most unthinkable
and senseless crime...

52:06.560 --> 52:09.120
All it takes is for something worse
to come along...

52:09.200 --> 52:10.720
...taken in a gray naval ambulance...

52:10.800 --> 52:14.600
...and you realize it was
actually happiness after all.

52:14.680 --> 52:18.600
...conveyed into the hospital in plain
sight of thousands of waiting mourners

52:19.440 --> 52:22.400
as disbelieving and shaken,
tonight, as our entire nation.

52:22.480 --> 52:24.040
She's still wearing the same clothes!

52:26.000 --> 52:28.600
Couldn't they have found her
something else?

52:28.680 --> 52:30.440
The President's casket was transferred...

52:30.520 --> 52:32.720
[Queen Mother] She's covered
in her husband's blood.

52:32.800 --> 52:35.880
Relatives and loved ones
joined the grieving Mrs. Kennedy

52:35.960 --> 52:38.880
-for a private mass in the East Room...
-No, I think it's deliberate.

52:38.960 --> 52:41.640
...before the body is moved
to the Rotunda of the Capitol.

52:41.720 --> 52:45.960
The last day in the life of the first
Catholic President of the United States.

52:46.040 --> 52:47.800
[Queen Mother] Where are you going?

52:48.560 --> 52:51.880
Lyndon Johnson,
sworn in on Air Force One,

52:51.960 --> 52:53.240
less than 100 minutes

52:53.320 --> 52:55.400
after the official death
of President Kennedy...

52:55.480 --> 52:56.600
[door slams]

53:04.720 --> 53:07.480
[radio news reporter]  He begins his work
as the 36th President...

53:07.560 --> 53:10.400
-Your Majesty.
-[Elizabeth] Michael.

53:11.040 --> 53:15.680
I'd like everyone in the royal household
to observe a full week of court mourning.

53:17.520 --> 53:21.200
And I would like the bell rung
at Westminster Abbey.

53:23.600 --> 53:27.000
[stuttering] Ma'am, custom dictates

53:27.080 --> 53:28.480
that the bell only be rung--

53:28.560 --> 53:32.000
When a member of the royal family dies.
[nervously] I know.

53:33.560 --> 53:39.640
But I would like it to be rung
every minute, for an hour,

53:40.600 --> 53:43.080
from eleven o'clock until midday.

53:47.280 --> 53:48.400
Yes, ma'am.

53:48.480 --> 53:50.920
[news reporter]  ...join President Johnson

53:51.000 --> 53:53.560
in his prayer for God's help.

53:53.640 --> 53:56.400
May we all find some light and hope

53:56.480 --> 53:59.480
in the darkness of the days
that lie ahead.

55:04.480 --> 55:06.200
[bell chimes]

55:08.560 --> 55:10.560
[bell chimes]

55:12.560 --> 55:14.560
[bell chimes]

55:16.640 --> 55:18.640
[bell chimes]
