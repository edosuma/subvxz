Lemuel:
You got to tease him, see?

01:26.053 --> 01:27.988
Fish sees that lure
moving around

01:28.055 --> 01:30.458
like a nice tasty frog.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.861
He's got no idea it's you.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.696
Then you get him.

01:37.465 --> 01:38.732
Okay.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.168
Hold that.

01:41.602 --> 01:45.873
But you can't ever let him
know who or what you are.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.842
You understand?

01:52.513 --> 01:55.183
I just picked this up
in town.

01:55.183 --> 01:56.450
All right.

02:13.967 --> 02:18.005
New film. San Francisco.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.873
Bring to me.

[knock on door]

03:11.259 --> 03:13.561
Sweetheart. Ha ha.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.498
You okay?

03:17.565 --> 03:19.933
I, uh, I need to talk to you.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.737
Both of you.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.540
All right, Juliana,
what is this about?

03:29.277 --> 03:30.578
Trudy.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.547
Have you seen her?

03:34.815 --> 03:36.817
She's dead, Ma.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.554
What?

03:40.621 --> 03:41.755
Um...

03:41.822 --> 03:44.625
she was shot by the Kempeitai.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.561
No, no.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.431
No, no. This--
There must be some mistake.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.199
No.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.568
There isn't.

03:54.635 --> 03:58.506
She got mixed up with some
guy from the Resistance,

03:58.572 --> 04:01.309
and someone told the Japanese.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.447
Juliana, who told you this?

04:12.320 --> 04:14.788
Someone who saw her body.

04:20.328 --> 04:22.796
Well, I don't believe it.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.133
Anne--

04:26.199 --> 04:28.336
No. I don't care
what she says.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.940
She's gone, Ma.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.509
Your sister is here.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.347
I can feel it.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.399
[knock on door]

05:05.973 --> 05:07.875
[knocking]

05:11.078 --> 05:12.145
[sigh]

05:12.212 --> 05:13.614
Ed?

05:15.616 --> 05:18.251
Ed? Hey, what's wrong?

05:18.386 --> 05:20.454
The Kempeitai
are at the factory.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.089
They had me
convert a replica.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.391
What?

05:23.457 --> 05:25.192
Bore out the barrel,
everything.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.627
Oh, shit.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.396
They must think the gun
that shot the Crown Prince

05:28.429 --> 05:29.663
was made in our shop.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.131
You've got to get
out of here, Frank,

05:31.198 --> 05:32.466
before they arrest you.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.101
Yeah, yeah. Well,
I was planning on it.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.135
When?

05:35.202 --> 05:36.970
Tonight. The 11:00 bus.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.839
- You've got enough money?
- Not yet, but I will.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.074
- Can you do me a favor?
- Anything.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.576
Can you pick up
the tickets?

05:42.643 --> 05:44.478
They might be
watching the station.

05:44.545 --> 05:45.746
I've got to get back.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.415
Uh, let me give you
some money.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.149
No, uh, I've got it.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.751
You and Jules
are going to need

05:50.818 --> 05:52.720
all the money
you can get.

05:55.756 --> 05:56.924
Ed.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.428
There's no way to thank you.

06:10.070 --> 06:16.176
That'll be 2.65 yen, hon.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.878
Joe:
I'll get that.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.948
Just keep the change.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.784
Just like old times, huh?

06:34.462 --> 06:35.863
Take a seat.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.103
What are you doing here?

06:44.672 --> 06:45.906
What do you think?

06:47.207 --> 06:48.942
They send you
to get the film?

06:49.009 --> 06:50.277
Yeah. And don't whisper.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.646
Just keep it low.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.182
How'd you find me?

06:55.248 --> 06:57.250
I followed you.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.752
I followed you
until I made sure

06:58.819 --> 07:00.120
you weren't being
followed yourself.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.490
What for?

07:02.490 --> 07:04.492
I need your help.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.995
Joe, I can't.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.565
I can't
be involved in this.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.901
There must be someone
that you know.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.169
Someone that helped
your sister.

07:16.236 --> 07:19.707
I need this, Juliana...

07:21.141 --> 07:23.043
more than anything.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.818
I see evidence
of sand casting.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.420
I left that deliberately,
just smoothed it

07:33.521 --> 07:34.421
where rubbing against
the Chief's skin

07:34.522 --> 07:35.823
would have polished it.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.127
That's--
That's excellent work.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.429
And so fast.

07:42.530 --> 07:43.797
Well, I'm motivated.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.166
What?

07:49.703 --> 07:52.673
When you approached me
about this, I was...

07:52.740 --> 07:54.007
somewhat agitated.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.076
You're not going to
back out on me, Childan.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.911
I understand that you're
highly motivated, Mr. Frink,

07:57.978 --> 08:00.548
but I'm not sure you appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

08:00.614 --> 08:01.549
What gravity?

08:01.582 --> 08:03.216
Selling a forgery

08:03.283 --> 08:05.252
to high-placed Japanese--

08:05.318 --> 08:06.854
Were this to go awry,

08:06.920 --> 08:09.322
I-- we could face
summary execution.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.859
Hey, listen, you're going
to fucking sell this,

08:11.925 --> 08:13.794
or I'm going straight
to the Kempeitai

08:13.861 --> 08:15.395
and tell them about
the bullets you sold me.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.264
You wouldn't dare
implicate yourself.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.866
You just watch me.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.434
Wait.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.836
I have a nervous
disposition.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.172
Just allow me a passing
moment of anxiety.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.375
There. Over.

08:28.441 --> 08:29.910
My greed has returned
undiminished.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.979
I will try to set up
the appointment.

08:32.045 --> 08:36.083
Not try. You sell it,
and today.

08:46.594 --> 08:47.895
Ahem.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.831
Good morning. Um,

08:50.898 --> 08:54.602
I'm looking for
three yellow daisies.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.008
I was wondering when you'd
finally turn up.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.746
I, uh, I got that job

09:05.813 --> 09:07.314
at the Nippon Building.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.618
We heard. Working for
the Trade Minister.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.620
That's pretty impressive.

09:13.621 --> 09:14.622
Yeah.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.090
I guess
you never found him.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.191
Find who?

09:18.258 --> 09:20.661
Sakura Iwasaru.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.030
Whoever it was betrayed
Randall and Trudy.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.199
Uh, no.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.268
Keep looking.

09:28.335 --> 09:31.171
It would be
a big help to us.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.240
I hear there's a new film.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.642
Oh, yeah?

09:34.708 --> 09:36.977
Where'd you hear that?

09:37.044 --> 09:38.646
There's a guy
looking for it--

09:38.679 --> 09:40.848
an operative from New York.

09:44.451 --> 09:47.821
He knows me from Canon City.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.423
I know you, too, but that's
not the way it works.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.660
He asked me
if I had any contacts.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.762
Said he's got resources.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.531
What exactly
did you tell him?

09:58.666 --> 10:00.300
I didn't
tell him anything.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.635
You sure?

10:01.702 --> 10:03.837
Yeah. Look, if you don't
want to trust him,

10:03.904 --> 10:09.276
I get it, but he
saved my life, so I do.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.781
If we need help
from the East Coast,

10:13.847 --> 10:15.115
we know how to get it,

10:15.182 --> 10:17.317
and it's not
by going through you.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.390
I'll see you around.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.029
Could you please tell Erin

10:29.096 --> 10:31.765
I'm very sorry I can't
make it this morning?

10:31.832 --> 10:33.066
Thank you kindly.

10:33.133 --> 10:37.037
The garden club?
You never miss that.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.239
Thomas has an appointment
with Dr. Adler.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.307
Girls?

10:40.373 --> 10:41.608
It's dumb.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.944
I fell in wrestling,

10:44.011 --> 10:45.979
and the school nurse made
a big deal out of it.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.514
That the same nurse
who wouldn't let you swim

10:47.580 --> 10:49.116
when you had hay fever?

10:49.182 --> 10:50.383
Nurse Krendle.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.620
Rhymes with Grendel.
Know who that was?

10:53.687 --> 10:55.723
The monster in Beowulf.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.591
I got an A in Aryan
literature, remember?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.193
Don't brag, Thomas.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.562
Look, you go. I--

11:02.629 --> 11:05.298
I'll take him to Dr. Adler.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.599
Are you sure?

11:06.734 --> 11:10.237
Yeah. Can't have my wife
miss garden club.

11:10.303 --> 11:14.141
You are a wonderful
husband, John Smith.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.109
Hey, none of that mushy stuff
in front of your son, please.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.778
Get in the car,
young man.

11:17.845 --> 11:21.048
On the way we can
discuss a math grade

11:21.114 --> 11:22.750
that was not something
to brag about.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.951

11:38.431 --> 11:40.100
Sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

11:40.167 --> 11:40.901
You're late.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.502
My truck
got a flat tire.

11:42.569 --> 11:43.771
Slowed me down.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.338
But no problems
at the border?

11:45.405 --> 11:46.606
Why are you so jumpy?

11:46.673 --> 11:48.776
Why aren't you?

11:48.809 --> 11:50.310
You mean
because he sent me?

11:50.377 --> 11:52.345
It's not normal.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.781
You got the money?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.983
10,000 yen.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.220
[engine starts]

12:25.612 --> 12:28.048

12:41.394 --> 12:43.230

12:44.397 --> 12:46.466
Man:
Listen carefully.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.368
We have what you came for.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.669
Who is this?

12:49.736 --> 12:51.238
Not important who we are.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.506
What's important
is you want film.

12:53.573 --> 12:54.607
And what do you want?

12:54.674 --> 12:56.676
100,000 yen.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.646
100,000?

14:10.951 --> 14:13.386
You responded quickly
to my call.

14:13.453 --> 14:17.390
With the hope you called
about something of importance.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.093
If you refer
to your investigation

14:20.160 --> 14:22.195
into the shooting
of the Crown Prince,

14:22.262 --> 14:25.232
I regret to say I still
have no information.

14:25.298 --> 14:29.536
Time is running short,
is it not, Chief Inspector?

14:30.938 --> 14:33.773
For you to apprehend
the shooter.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.576
Why did you
call us here?

14:36.643 --> 14:39.779
These films...

14:39.846 --> 14:43.550
for the Man
In the High Castle.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.318
A new one has surfaced.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.956
Has it?

14:50.257 --> 14:53.293
This is the name
of a man in Oakland.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.362
He intended
to sell the film

14:55.428 --> 14:58.298
but, tragically,
was murdered.

14:58.365 --> 15:02.102
The film in his possession
has vanished.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.504
What have you
done with it?

15:06.974 --> 15:09.376
Chief Inspector, please
instruct your sergeant

15:09.442 --> 15:12.345
to address me
with the proper respect.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.548
You realize we can shut down
your whorehouses, your bars,

15:15.615 --> 15:19.987
restaurants, drug trade,
whenever we choose.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.489
Then there are labor
problems at the docks

15:22.555 --> 15:26.026
and revelations that
high government officials

15:26.093 --> 15:29.429
are drug addicts
and perverts.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.634
Isn't this better,
Chief Inspector,

15:34.701 --> 15:37.770
doing business
as friends?

15:37.837 --> 15:40.173
How much do you want?

15:40.240 --> 15:42.709
For the Kempeitai,
a special price.

15:45.912 --> 15:48.515
150,000 yen.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.587
You may prey upon
the weak and the corrupt,

15:54.654 --> 15:56.323
but do not for a moment think

15:56.389 --> 16:00.027
you can shake down officers
of the Emperor's Kempeitai.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.779
Nurse, this is ridiculous.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.581
He's been in there
over an hour.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.850
I'm very sorry,
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.152
[door opens]

16:27.454 --> 16:29.689
My deepest apologies
for keeping you waiting.

16:29.756 --> 16:30.957
Everything all right?

16:31.058 --> 16:32.359
Looks like your boy
pulled a muscle.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.061
Nothing a little ice
won't fix.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.328
Told you I was fine.

16:35.395 --> 16:38.331
And can I have a word
in private?

16:39.632 --> 16:40.767
Certainly.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.176
Please take a seat.

16:50.877 --> 16:53.080
Can we, uh,
make this brief, doctor?

16:53.113 --> 16:55.715
I'm late for work as it is.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.852
No, thank you.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.589
Um...

17:02.655 --> 17:04.424
this, um...

17:04.491 --> 17:06.993
this won't be easy
for you to hear.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.362
Thomas didn't
just pull a muscle

17:09.429 --> 17:11.531
wrestling,
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.100
He had a tremor.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.936
A tremor?

17:17.003 --> 17:18.371
I wish I could tell you

17:18.438 --> 17:20.907
that it was just
growing pains,

17:20.973 --> 17:23.176
but your son
has a serious disease.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.746
Landouzy-Dejurine syndrome.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.782
The symptoms,
vague at first,

17:29.849 --> 17:33.220
are loss of coordination,
weakness in the arms,

17:33.286 --> 17:34.387
difficulty hearing--

17:34.454 --> 17:36.123
That's-- That's nonsense.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.825
My son is
the picture of health.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.993
I'm afraid he isn't.

17:41.128 --> 17:44.897
Within months,
perhaps a year,

17:44.964 --> 17:46.766
there will be paralysis.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.369
That's a mistake, doctor.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.171
You're making a mistake.

17:51.238 --> 17:54.507
I would never tell you this
were I not certain.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.577
He scored 10 out of 10
on the indicators

17:57.644 --> 18:00.480
in the Brandt-Sievers
nerve test.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.222
Okay.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.458
So what's the--

18:12.492 --> 18:14.661
what's the treatment?

18:16.296 --> 18:17.764
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer,

18:17.830 --> 18:21.067
we're talking about
a class A congenital disorder.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.336
There is no treatment.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.038
What do you mean,
there is no treatment?

18:26.173 --> 18:28.341
No, I'm not
accepting that, no.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.277
There's got to be some
other tests you can run.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.711
I want a second opinion.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.780
You have the option,

18:33.846 --> 18:35.615
but you should be aware

18:35.682 --> 18:38.685
that if he is submitted
to others for examination,

18:38.751 --> 18:43.456
this becomes
an institutional issue.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.697
Oh, I see.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.702
Yes, of course.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.371
By virtue of your position,

18:58.438 --> 19:00.573
I feel what must be done

19:00.640 --> 19:03.843
can be done in the kinder
setting of your home.

19:03.910 --> 19:07.847
I will hold your son's
file outside the system,

19:07.914 --> 19:09.316
give you the time you need.

19:09.382 --> 19:13.620
As for, uh,
medical assistance...

19:15.988 --> 19:21.093
a syringe and an ampule
of an effective combination:

19:21.228 --> 19:24.764
morphine scopolamine
and prussic acid.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.934
Absolutely painless.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.702
If you like, I can show you

19:29.769 --> 19:32.339
how to locate a vein
in the back of the hand.

19:39.145 --> 19:41.681
[speaking Japanese]

19:42.782 --> 19:44.317
These came for you.

19:46.253 --> 19:47.687
Arigato.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.406
You are late, Miss Crain.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.208
Yes. I'm sorry. Here.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.278
Allow me.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.512
Leave it.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.153
Mr. Kotomichi,
please forgive me

20:21.220 --> 20:22.689
if I've done something
to offend you.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.057
You have done nothing
to offend me, Miss Crain.

20:25.124 --> 20:28.761
It is your presence.
It brings danger.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.998
You cannot know what he risked
giving you employment.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.766
Look, I don't wish
to harm him.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.702
And yet you will.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.605
[speaking Japanese]

20:46.245 --> 20:47.947
Good morning, Miss Crain.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.951
These are for you.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.821
[whispering in Japanese]

21:02.194 --> 21:06.866
I see from your file that you
studied geography in school.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.336
Yes, among other things.

21:09.369 --> 21:12.071
I have an assignment
for you, Miss Crain.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.740
It is sensitive by nature

21:13.806 --> 21:15.975
and requires
your utmost discretion.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.044
I'm honored.

21:20.012 --> 21:23.115
A general from Tokyo
will arrive tomorrow.

21:23.182 --> 21:29.055
He seeks information
about uranium deposits
in the Neutral Zone.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.591
What kind of information?

21:31.658 --> 21:35.261
Size and location
of unexplored deposits.

21:35.362 --> 21:38.998
I believe there hasn't been
a survey since the war.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.100
Hmm.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.435
Might I have permission

21:42.502 --> 21:44.471
to leave the building,
Trade Minister?

21:47.407 --> 21:49.809
Why, may I ask?

21:49.876 --> 21:53.780
The library possesses
all geographical surveys.

21:53.846 --> 21:57.484
Um, I thought maybe
they would be of use.

22:00.052 --> 22:03.590
You visited the address
I gave you?

22:05.392 --> 22:07.960
It was as you said
it would be.

22:11.431 --> 22:14.934
I am sorry for your loss.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.036
Not just my loss.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.007
[sighs]

22:21.073 --> 22:22.809
Go on, Miss Crain.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.655
Arigato.

22:43.295 --> 22:44.831
Hello.

22:49.836 --> 22:50.937
Hello?

22:53.105 --> 22:55.074
You come here alone?

22:55.141 --> 22:57.009
Yeah. Of course.

23:00.847 --> 23:01.981
It's clear.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.083
What the hell
are you doing here?

23:04.150 --> 23:06.653
Take one guess.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.888
Look, I can't help you.

23:08.955 --> 23:11.691
We need you to take us
to your friend

23:11.758 --> 23:13.460
Joe Blake.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.969
[knock knock]

23:24.170 --> 23:25.605
Yes?

23:27.173 --> 23:28.808
What is it, Captain?

23:28.875 --> 23:29.809
Sir,

23:29.876 --> 23:31.478
OberstgruppenfÃ¼hrer
Heydrich

23:31.478 --> 23:33.245
has just
entered the building.

23:33.312 --> 23:36.148
Heydrich?

23:36.215 --> 23:37.517
Are you sure?

23:37.584 --> 23:39.118
I'm surprised
myself, sir,

23:39.185 --> 23:40.987
but he's
on his way up now.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.723
All right, send him in.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.726
No need. Here I am.

23:50.062 --> 23:53.600
OberstgruppenfÃ¼hrer,
what a surprise.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.367
You should have told me
you were coming.

23:55.502 --> 23:57.236
I'd have prepared
a hero's welcome.

23:57.303 --> 23:59.706
That is precisely
why I didn't.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.609
This is a working vacation.

24:03.610 --> 24:06.112
Lina has come
for the children.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.417
Hmm.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.786
I have achieved much

24:13.853 --> 24:15.955
under the leadership
of the FÃ¼hrer, John.

24:16.022 --> 24:19.526
The eradication
of the Semites in Europe,

24:19.592 --> 24:22.829
the enslavement
of the African continent.

24:22.895 --> 24:25.532
You are the man
with the iron heart.

24:28.267 --> 24:31.571
A title I wear proudly.

24:31.638 --> 24:35.542
But, as I've grown older,

24:35.542 --> 24:37.143
I've come to realize

24:37.209 --> 24:40.146
nothing is more important
than family.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.182
No.

24:43.249 --> 24:46.786
I've rented a cottage
in East Hampton.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.388
Our families must meet.

24:49.455 --> 24:51.591
Your children--

24:51.658 --> 24:53.793
sprechen sie schon Deutsch?

24:55.595 --> 24:57.630
Better than me, certainly.

24:57.697 --> 25:00.199
Ah. I seem to recall.

25:03.770 --> 25:07.974
Still, it hasn't inhibited
your advancement, has it?

25:08.040 --> 25:11.744
The FÃ¼hrer places
great faith in you, John,

25:11.811 --> 25:15.982
to collect
these films of his.

25:16.048 --> 25:19.185
Yes, he does.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.354
I understand terrorists
claimed the life

25:22.421 --> 25:26.492
of HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer Lautz
and very nearly yours.

25:26.593 --> 25:27.694
Yes.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.162
My aide is still
in the hospital.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.731
Critical condition.

25:31.798 --> 25:33.032
You've made no arrests?

25:33.099 --> 25:36.068
Oh, yes. One.
He died in custody.

25:37.704 --> 25:41.507
So you still don't know
how they got to you.

25:41.608 --> 25:43.743
Not yet, no.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.851
Thank you, Captain.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.903
What are you doing here,
Reinhard?

26:10.970 --> 26:15.074
And don't tell me
it's a family vacation.

26:15.141 --> 26:18.277
I think you can guess,
John.

26:20.212 --> 26:21.748
It's Rudolph Wegener.

26:23.249 --> 26:27.920
I gather you've
extracted no confession

26:27.987 --> 26:30.823
about his activities
in San Francisco?

26:35.962 --> 26:37.764
What's your
business with him?

26:37.830 --> 26:41.433
I've come to take him
into custody.

26:41.500 --> 26:44.103
He's my prisoner.

26:44.170 --> 26:47.907
You forget with whom
you are speaking.

26:53.680 --> 26:57.183
Wegener answers
to Goebbels, not you.

26:59.385 --> 27:02.188
I will take him nonetheless.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.356
My men will be here
within the hour.

27:08.494 --> 27:12.131
I look forward to spending
some time together

27:12.198 --> 27:13.199
while I'm here, John.

27:13.265 --> 27:17.036
Maybe we can do
a little hunting. Hmm?

27:27.880 --> 27:29.716
[knock on door]

27:37.824 --> 27:40.727
[sigh]
Am I glad to see you.

27:40.793 --> 27:42.128
Did you talk to them?

27:42.194 --> 27:44.263
Yeah, except they made me
bring them to you.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.739
I didn't expect you.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.874
That puts us even.

27:54.941 --> 27:58.110
I, uh, told them
you had resources.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.781
What do you need?

28:01.848 --> 28:03.149
100,000 yen.

28:03.215 --> 28:08.254
That's a lot of ramen.
Why so much?

28:08.320 --> 28:09.588
To pay the Yakuza.

28:09.655 --> 28:11.023
You've got to be kidding me.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.258
They took the film
from the man

28:12.324 --> 28:14.026
who was going
to sell it to us.

28:14.093 --> 28:15.895
He's lying dead on a bench
in Sutro Heights.

28:15.962 --> 28:17.229
Can you get that much?

28:17.296 --> 28:19.098
Yeah, I can get it.

28:22.268 --> 28:23.269
[doorbell rings]

28:25.504 --> 28:26.605
- Yes?
- Robert Childan

28:26.672 --> 28:28.040
to see Mr. and Mrs. Kasoura.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.175
Regarding?

28:29.241 --> 28:31.177
I've brought a piece
of art they wish to see.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.179
Do you remember me?
I was here for dinner.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.214
Use the tradesman's
entrance, please,

28:35.281 --> 28:36.582
just around the side.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.017
No, I'm not a tradesman.

28:38.084 --> 28:39.618
I'm awaited
by the Kasouras.

28:39.685 --> 28:41.487
And I've had instructions.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.956
The housekeeper will let you
in the service entrance.

28:44.023 --> 28:47.794
I was a guest before,
and I'm a guest now, damn it.

28:47.794 --> 28:49.228
Problem here?

28:50.562 --> 28:52.464
Uh, no.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.533
No problem.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.870
Uh, I'll use
the side entrance.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.307
Thank you.

29:16.288 --> 29:19.892
Captain Connolly,
you continue to surprise me.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.829
Sir?

29:22.895 --> 29:25.965
You knew how our guest
takes his coffee:

29:26.032 --> 29:28.700
black with four cubes
of sugar.

29:28.835 --> 29:33.239
Thanks to
OberstgruppenfÃ¼hrer
Heydrich's office in Berlin.

29:33.305 --> 29:36.909
His adjutant told me
how he takes his coffee.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.245
So you did know
he was coming.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.415
No. I simply exchange
information with him

29:43.482 --> 29:44.650
as a matter of course.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.485
So when you go to Berlin,
he'll know

29:46.552 --> 29:49.021
exactly how you take
your coffee, too.

29:49.088 --> 29:54.260
Well, I commend you
on your attention to detail.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.030
Where are you going?

29:58.097 --> 30:00.066
To talk to Colonel Wegener.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.667
Would you like me
to accompany you?

30:01.868 --> 30:03.202
That won't be necessary.

30:15.681 --> 30:17.283
Hello, Rudolph.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.291
I never expected
to see you again, John.

30:27.359 --> 30:28.895
Nor I you.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.905
You're to be taken
into custody, Rudy...

30:41.073 --> 30:43.910
by OberstgruppenfÃ¼hrer
Heydrich.

30:43.976 --> 30:47.346
Heydrich.

30:47.413 --> 30:50.582
He flew all the way
from Berlin...

30:52.484 --> 30:54.520
expressly to see you.

30:56.989 --> 30:59.926
I don't suppose you'd
care to tell me why.

31:02.428 --> 31:07.499
Rudy, you realize I could
have had you tortured.

31:09.201 --> 31:12.238
The only reason you're alive
right now is because of me.

31:12.304 --> 31:13.605
I realize.

31:13.672 --> 31:16.508
You think you'll fare
better under Heydrich?

31:18.610 --> 31:19.946
Of course not.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.613
So tell me what you did.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.814
Tell me what you did

31:22.949 --> 31:24.783
before--
before it's too late.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.685
If I tell you, then what?

31:26.752 --> 31:28.320
I'll try to help you.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.823
While you attempt to mitigate
the damage of my treason?

31:31.958 --> 31:33.993
Yes, of course.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.033
I'm prepared to die, John.

31:43.769 --> 31:45.204
I prefer it...

31:46.272 --> 31:48.807
to breathing one more breath

31:48.874 --> 31:51.443
under service to the State.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.114
What happened to you,
Rudolph?

31:55.181 --> 31:57.816
We have blood on our hands.

31:57.883 --> 32:00.419
Yes.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.688
We spilt blood.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.094
We spilt blood.

32:09.461 --> 32:14.733
And I'd spill it again
to protect my family.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.703
Is that what
you think you've done?

32:17.769 --> 32:20.406
You can live
in your world, John...

32:22.741 --> 32:25.011
if you can stand it.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.013
I can't.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.049
Not anymore.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.532
Goodbye, Rudy.

32:50.536 --> 32:52.871
Childan:
This is indeed a first.

32:52.938 --> 32:56.308
It's unique, singular.

32:56.375 --> 33:00.512
The personal treasure
of a true American legend.

33:03.082 --> 33:06.252
Now, as you hold this,
think that anything

33:06.318 --> 33:08.920
that once graced the neck
of this mighty chief--

33:09.055 --> 33:12.224
every amulet,
every beaded wrist band,

33:12.291 --> 33:16.462
even the clothing worn by
an Indian warrior such as he--

33:16.528 --> 33:19.531
is endowed
with spiritual power.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.435
Here it is in the photograph,

33:23.502 --> 33:26.205
absolving any question
of authenticity.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.080
It's very small in photo.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.614
That's exactly what I thought
when I first was it,

33:35.681 --> 33:40.619
so I had this done,
this fine grain enlargement.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.288
If I cannot authenticate,

33:42.354 --> 33:44.123
I have no right
to be in business.

33:44.190 --> 33:47.093
Still, it shows
very little detail.

33:47.126 --> 33:49.695
But it's clearly the necklace.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.099
But is this truly proof?

33:53.165 --> 33:56.602
Excuse Paul.
He's a lawyer.

33:56.668 --> 34:00.572
I am not unaware
that, for some Americans,

34:00.639 --> 34:04.110
there's a sense of victory
in deceiving the Japanese.

34:04.176 --> 34:06.645
Mr. Kasoura,
I would never--

34:08.714 --> 34:11.783
Please, a careful examination
of that necklace

34:11.850 --> 34:12.884
and the photos offer proof.

34:12.951 --> 34:14.320
Wu.

34:15.987 --> 34:17.289
[speaking Japanese]

34:19.291 --> 34:21.560
[speaking Japanese]

34:26.965 --> 34:28.667
This necklace has wu.

34:28.734 --> 34:31.437
I can feel it.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.473
This is from someone

34:34.540 --> 34:37.176
who has known
great sorrow.

34:39.311 --> 34:44.316
You know that this
belonged to a noble man

34:44.383 --> 34:46.652
whose people
were annihilated.

34:51.723 --> 34:54.226
Do you see the sadness
in those eyes?

35:05.237 --> 35:06.672
[knock knock]

35:17.416 --> 35:19.218
Okay. We have a deal.

35:19.285 --> 35:20.252
Lemuel: When?

35:20.319 --> 35:21.587
Tonight at 10.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.422
A place called
The Bamboo Palace.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.023
Can you get the money
by then?

35:25.090 --> 35:26.492
I'll get it.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.527
Wait.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.329
The Yakuza
would sooner kill you

35:30.396 --> 35:32.398
than hand over that film.
You realize that?

35:33.799 --> 35:35.467
We'll take our chances.

35:40.071 --> 35:41.072
Okay, then.

35:41.207 --> 35:42.474
Hey, wait a second.

35:45.211 --> 35:47.213
When am I going
to see you again?

35:49.715 --> 35:50.916
You won't.

35:54.686 --> 35:57.823
There are things
I want to say to you.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.925
I can't do this, Joe.

36:03.061 --> 36:04.330
[sob]

36:09.235 --> 36:10.569
Juliana.

36:12.871 --> 36:14.506
Frank's a lucky guy.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.892
What's that cop
doing out there?

37:06.958 --> 37:09.295
Uh, I don't know.

37:09.328 --> 37:10.696
Nothing to do with me.

37:10.762 --> 37:11.997
Did you sell it?

37:13.131 --> 37:14.366
Hey, did you sell it?

37:14.433 --> 37:16.468
Yes, yes. Here.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.773
Your share's all there.
It's 46,000 yen.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.310
You fooled him, huh?

37:24.310 --> 37:25.911
Yeah.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.346
He wasn't sure at first,

37:27.413 --> 37:30.482
but, uh, evidently,
you have wu.

37:31.983 --> 37:34.320
Great pain
and suffering.

37:34.386 --> 37:36.422
Well, that I got
plenty of.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.723
Listen, are you sure

37:37.789 --> 37:39.325
that cop's got nothing
to do with you?

37:39.391 --> 37:41.226
Yeah, yeah,
I'm sure. Why?

37:41.327 --> 37:42.728
Why?

37:42.794 --> 37:45.831
Because we just made
a boatload of money, my friend.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.133
With my salesmanship
and your skills,

37:48.199 --> 37:49.335
we can make a boatload more.

37:49.335 --> 37:51.737
We could, but we won't.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.372
It was good doing business
with you, Childan.

37:53.439 --> 37:55.941
It's time for you to go.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.344
Come on.

38:03.349 --> 38:07.653
- I won that.
- No, I won.

38:07.719 --> 38:08.954
I did it.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.358
How'd it go?

38:12.358 --> 38:14.493
I ran the, uh--

38:14.560 --> 38:17.663
extra 2 kilometers, they said.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.832
You see? I knew
you had it in you.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.868
You keep it up.

38:22.934 --> 38:24.202
May I, uh...

38:24.269 --> 38:25.904
May I clean up
for dinner?

38:25.971 --> 38:27.373
Well, you'd better.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.274
Thank you, Mother.

38:29.375 --> 38:30.976
Well done.

38:32.678 --> 38:35.180
You push him too hard.

38:35.246 --> 38:36.882
I do nothing of the kind.

38:36.948 --> 38:38.116
He was tired today.

38:38.183 --> 38:40.686
He's a teenager,
that's all.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.655
What did Dr. Adler say?

38:46.057 --> 38:48.427
He, uh, pulled a muscle.

38:48.494 --> 38:52.698
Our Nurse Krendle is a--
a touch overprotective.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.101
- Hmm.
- [phone rings]

39:00.038 --> 39:01.106
[ring]

39:01.172 --> 39:03.809
Smith residence.

39:03.875 --> 39:06.445
Oh, hello, Joe.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.747
Yeah, he's--
he's right here.

39:16.422 --> 39:17.423
Well?

39:17.456 --> 39:19.625
Uh, good news, I think.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.428
I've made contact
with the Resistance here.

39:24.262 --> 39:26.532
What do you mean,
you think?

39:26.598 --> 39:28.767
The film's been taken
by the Yakuza.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.671
Go on.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.873
They're willing to sell it

39:34.940 --> 39:36.908
for 100,000 yen.

39:40.446 --> 39:42.881
Joe,

39:42.948 --> 39:45.083
if I agree to this,

39:45.150 --> 39:48.920
you guarantee that they
will honor this bargain?

39:50.456 --> 39:51.823
Yes, sir.

39:53.258 --> 39:58.664
Joe, I need to know that you
understand what I'm saying.

40:01.533 --> 40:03.134
I do, sir.

40:03.201 --> 40:04.970
Good.

40:06.271 --> 40:08.106
You'll need to get
to the Embassy

40:08.173 --> 40:09.641
without being seen.

40:11.042 --> 40:14.079
I'll make sure I transfer
the funds there for you.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.413
Thank you, sir.

40:15.481 --> 40:17.415
Thank you for giving me
a second chance.

40:32.330 --> 40:33.565
[door closes]

40:36.201 --> 40:38.670
Frank, Frank, there's
a policeman out there.

40:38.737 --> 40:41.807
Yeah, I know. He's been
there all afternoon.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.610
- What's he doing?
- I don't know. Just watching.

40:45.811 --> 40:47.278
Look, we got to get
out of here.

40:47.345 --> 40:48.714
Did you get the money?

40:48.780 --> 40:50.181
Right here, and Ed's
got the bus tickets.

40:50.248 --> 40:52.484
He's going to meet us
at Foley Street at 11.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.186
At 11?

40:55.253 --> 40:56.722
Yeah. Why?

40:56.788 --> 41:00.692
Just that the Japanese man
who gave me my job

41:00.759 --> 41:01.993
has been really kind to me.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.562
You can't worry
about that, Jules.

41:03.629 --> 41:05.597
We've got to
worry about us.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.133
Come on.

41:08.199 --> 41:09.868
We'll start over,

41:09.935 --> 41:11.837
some place where
our biggest problem

41:11.903 --> 41:14.172
is deciding what to name
our first kid.

41:16.274 --> 41:17.943
Okay.

41:22.380 --> 41:24.449
Okay, we'll go see Mom.

41:24.550 --> 41:26.417
We'll go see Mama,
and we'll go.

41:26.552 --> 41:28.820
Jules.
Come on, we can't.

41:28.887 --> 41:30.989
Frank, I can't just leave
without saying goodbye.

41:31.056 --> 41:33.058
She just lost a daughter.
It'll drive her mad.

41:33.124 --> 41:34.259
I-- I have to.

41:34.325 --> 41:35.594
You're going
to tell Arnold

41:35.661 --> 41:37.563
we're leaving
for the Neutral Zone?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.201
All right.

41:44.736 --> 41:46.572
All right, we'll go
see them one last time,

41:46.572 --> 41:48.239
but you can't tell them
anything, okay?

41:50.576 --> 41:51.877
Okay.

42:06.024 --> 42:08.594
I woke up
to an empty bed.

42:09.494 --> 42:11.797
I couldn't sleep.

42:11.863 --> 42:15.166
I could tell something
was bothering you.

42:20.138 --> 42:22.040
Just a couple
of things at work.

42:39.825 --> 42:42.093
Look at you and Edmond.

42:42.961 --> 42:46.231
You know how lucky you were?

42:46.297 --> 42:50.101
I grew up an only child
playing with dolls on my own.

42:52.203 --> 42:53.805
I worshiped him.

43:04.883 --> 43:06.517
Seeing your brother
like that,

43:06.652 --> 43:10.088
it must have broken
your father's heart.

43:12.290 --> 43:13.324
Yeah.

43:16.795 --> 43:19.064
Well, at least now, when
someone is terribly ill,

43:19.130 --> 43:21.266
they're not allowed
to suffer.

43:24.402 --> 43:25.904
That's a blessing.

43:29.775 --> 43:31.276
Come back to bed.

43:52.831 --> 43:53.965
You got the money?

43:54.032 --> 43:56.301
I got it.
So what's the drill?

43:56.367 --> 43:57.836
I'm doing this, not you.

43:57.903 --> 44:01.339
No deal.
It's my cash, my job.

44:01.406 --> 44:02.774
That's non-negotiable.

44:05.576 --> 44:07.145
We'll be waiting
right outside.

44:07.212 --> 44:08.847
We keep the money
in your coat.

44:08.914 --> 44:10.782
Check it when you
go inside the club.

44:10.849 --> 44:12.718
Have yourself a drink.
When you leave,

44:12.718 --> 44:14.585
the coat checker
hands it back to you

44:14.720 --> 44:16.287
with the film
inside the lining.

44:16.354 --> 44:18.323
Okay.

44:18.389 --> 44:19.825
Let's do it.

44:38.543 --> 44:40.145
[speaking Japanese]

44:46.584 --> 44:50.021
Is there anything else
that you need, Trade Minister?

44:50.088 --> 44:53.124
No. Nothing, Kotomishi.
Thank you.

44:58.196 --> 45:00.899
Miss Crain never returned
this afternoon.

45:03.401 --> 45:04.870
No.

45:36.201 --> 45:38.336
That was delicious, Anne.

45:38.403 --> 45:41.206
I'm glad you thought so.

45:42.273 --> 45:45.343
Juliana's
barely eaten a thing.

45:45.410 --> 45:46.812
Sorry, Ma.

45:48.113 --> 45:49.915
I'm just
not that hungry.

46:09.835 --> 46:12.270
Juliana, I don't expect
you to forgive me.

46:12.337 --> 46:14.973
It's not up to me
to forgive you.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.842
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

46:16.875 --> 46:18.844
You have to believe
that I didn't.

46:20.378 --> 46:21.479
I know.

46:21.546 --> 46:23.381
They promised me.

46:23.448 --> 46:25.316
Juliana, they promised me.

46:28.887 --> 46:31.156
Now, listen, I--

46:31.222 --> 46:33.424
I don't know
what you're up to.

46:33.491 --> 46:36.862
I don't know how deeply
you're mixed up in this,

46:36.862 --> 46:38.096
but you listen to me.

46:38.163 --> 46:44.002
Whatever it is,
tonight you stay away.

46:44.069 --> 46:45.971
What are you talking about?

46:46.037 --> 46:48.874
We picked up
some phone chatter.

46:48.874 --> 46:50.741
The Yakuza
are selling the film

46:50.876 --> 46:52.477
to operatives
in the Resistance.

46:52.543 --> 46:54.312
The Kempeitai are
going to be there, too.

46:54.379 --> 46:56.882
Why?

46:56.948 --> 46:58.683
To take the film

46:58.749 --> 47:00.919
and kill the operatives.

47:02.387 --> 47:04.890
Frank, I got to go.

47:04.956 --> 47:07.292
I left something at work.

47:07.358 --> 47:08.626
Okay.
