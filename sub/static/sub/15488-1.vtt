01:17.792 --> 01:19.291
To look at me now,

01:19.625 --> 01:22.082
I seem like the chick
out to piss people off,

01:22.500 --> 01:25.374
posting selfies,
chilling out on the beach,

01:25.542 --> 01:27.624
saying "How's Paris, guys?"

01:29.125 --> 01:30.957
The chick who chucked it all

01:32.042 --> 01:33.457
to start a new life.

01:38.375 --> 01:40.582
But I didn't decide to live here.

01:44.292 --> 01:46.291
I just want to go back to Paris.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.749
But for the moment,

01:49.583 --> 01:50.207
no way.

03:07.542 --> 03:10.416
I'd often wondered
how far one'd go for friends.

03:11.083 --> 03:12.457
If there was a limit.

03:13.292 --> 03:15.249
When I ask myself now,

03:15.417 --> 03:16.541
I know the answer.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.916
But a year ago, I had no idea.

03:21.250 --> 03:22.624
I was miles away.

03:23.417 --> 03:25.082
Go, go, go!

03:26.167 --> 03:27.124
Almost!

03:27.333 --> 03:28.499
Go for it!

03:28.917 --> 03:30.707
I got 20 on blondie.

03:36.625 --> 03:38.541
Go on! I put 50 on you!

03:38.875 --> 03:40.957
Don't look at your dad, focus!

03:43.750 --> 03:45.749
Can't catch a single one!

03:45.917 --> 03:46.832
He sucks!

03:47.375 --> 03:49.999
The spliff smoker is Timothy.

03:50.167 --> 03:51.582
He's terrific. Get this:

03:51.750 --> 03:54.457
He's on his fourth freshman year.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.291
First it was Economics.

03:56.625 --> 03:57.666
Then Art.

03:57.833 --> 03:58.707
Then Philosophy.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.332
Now English.

04:02.250 --> 04:05.124
But the dummy
thinks it's cooler to say "American."

04:05.292 --> 04:06.291
He should be a cook...

04:06.458 --> 04:08.332
Tonight's special:

04:08.500 --> 04:10.041
tartare of clit

04:10.208 --> 04:12.416
and a julienne of rump.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.791
It's always a treat.

04:14.958 --> 04:15.874
It's salmon.

04:16.333 --> 04:17.457
Where's he gonna end up?

04:17.625 --> 04:20.916
That guy can do and say
the dumbest things...

04:21.083 --> 04:22.707
- Do me a blowback?
- Cut it out!

04:22.875 --> 04:23.541
Come on!

04:23.708 --> 04:24.582
I don't feel like it.

04:24.750 --> 04:26.582
C'mon, don't be a drag.

04:27.417 --> 04:29.291
But you forgive him.

04:29.625 --> 04:31.416
Only one round left.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.499
The one trying to cheat

04:33.667 --> 04:34.624
is my favorite.

04:35.583 --> 04:37.457
Vadim was a quiet little boy,

04:37.625 --> 04:39.249
but now he's got phobias,

04:39.417 --> 04:40.999
he's a hypochondriac

04:41.417 --> 04:42.999
and a nervous wreck.

04:43.292 --> 04:44.457
I first met him

04:44.708 --> 04:46.957
at my 4th birthday at Mickey D's.

04:47.375 --> 04:49.207
I knew right off he liked me.

04:49.708 --> 04:52.499
When a little butterball gives you
his only cheeseburger,

04:52.875 --> 04:53.791
it's pretty obvious.

04:54.750 --> 04:56.999
Nestor's the black hunk.

04:57.792 --> 04:59.666
He's cramming for his bar exams.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.374
When he's focused like that,

05:01.542 --> 05:02.502
nothing distracts him...

05:02.750 --> 05:03.457
Except...

05:03.625 --> 05:05.499
Nestor doesn't talk much,

05:05.917 --> 05:07.332
but he doesn't need to.

05:11.750 --> 05:13.999
I was interning at William & Co.

05:14.167 --> 05:15.916
This report's shit.

05:16.083 --> 05:16.749
Actually,

05:16.958 --> 05:18.332
it was just after William & Co.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.916
Hey, I've always been polite.

05:21.083 --> 05:22.207
Relax!

05:22.417 --> 05:23.707
Shove your report!

05:23.875 --> 05:24.749
How dare you!

05:24.917 --> 05:26.582
Little preppie cocksucker

05:26.750 --> 05:28.999
in your crummy cardigan and loafers!

05:29.208 --> 05:30.457
- Pervert!
- Excuse me?

05:30.625 --> 05:31.916
That means, go suck a trans!

05:33.292 --> 05:34.166
You slob!

05:34.542 --> 05:35.749
What'd I say?

05:35.917 --> 05:37.082
Go on!

05:37.250 --> 05:39.082
Hit the ring and it's a sure win!

05:41.000 --> 05:42.916
- Talk about a reversal!
- Shit!

05:43.083 --> 05:44.541
Hand over the dough.

05:44.708 --> 05:46.791
Samuel's a different trip:
a chronic optimist.

05:47.375 --> 05:48.707
It'll be fine.

05:48.875 --> 05:51.166
I promised you the concert.
In 10 minutes...

05:51.333 --> 05:53.332
We're only 30 miles away.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.999
Trust me.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.416
Happy birthday!

05:58.583 --> 05:59.707
Always out to please.

05:59.875 --> 06:02.916
I got a size 8.
They only had these big boxes.

06:03.167 --> 06:04.582
The receipt, for exchanges.

06:04.750 --> 06:06.082
Yeppa!

06:10.458 --> 06:13.582
He's rich. His dad made a mint
in the rag trade.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.041
"Esteem is founded on comparison:"

06:17.208 --> 06:18.124
He wants to act.

06:18.292 --> 06:20.166
"To honor all men is to honor none."

06:20.333 --> 06:21.291
He'll do anything to make it.

06:21.458 --> 06:22.666
I'm not sure of the moves.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.207
But that feels right.

06:24.833 --> 06:26.457
The standing deal is:

06:26.625 --> 06:29.207
Samuel supposedly stays
in medical school,

06:29.750 --> 06:30.916
and his dad supports him.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.999
Blood was spurting all over.

06:33.167 --> 06:34.624
We lost the guy's pulse,

06:35.375 --> 06:37.124
resuss table, I guided them:

06:37.292 --> 06:38.457
a 260 shock,

06:38.750 --> 06:40.374
then a 360 shock

06:40.542 --> 06:42.874
and we got a pulse back.
He came around.

06:43.042 --> 06:43.707
Nice going!

06:43.875 --> 06:45.166
That's routine.

06:45.417 --> 06:47.082
Hop in, my lovelies.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.374
When we met in grade school,

06:54.542 --> 06:57.041
we swore we'd live together one day.

06:57.625 --> 06:58.749
All five of us.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.666
What? No more chocolate ones?

07:05.833 --> 07:06.957
They ate 'em all.

07:07.125 --> 07:09.041
I doze off and they're gone!

07:09.208 --> 07:10.624
Faster! You're crawling.

07:10.792 --> 07:12.916
Can't scratch the rims.
Dad'll be pissed.

07:13.083 --> 07:14.957
What's he care? He's got 15 others.

07:15.125 --> 07:16.457
Yeah, with nice rims.

07:16.625 --> 07:18.124
"15 others, with nice rims..."

07:18.292 --> 07:21.041
I hear you jiving me in the rearview!

07:21.208 --> 07:22.499
I'll let you have it!

07:22.667 --> 07:24.249
Move it, you snail!

07:25.583 --> 07:27.791
A real trek at the end.

07:27.958 --> 07:28.916
I'm starved!

07:31.500 --> 07:32.707
Hey, city slickers.

07:33.458 --> 07:34.916
Trashing out?

07:35.083 --> 07:36.541
You bet we are.

07:36.917 --> 07:37.916
What's that mean?

07:38.083 --> 07:38.957
I dunno.

07:39.208 --> 07:39.874
Your dad around?

07:40.333 --> 07:42.249
In the barn. C'mon.

07:48.917 --> 07:51.874
I love it when a plan comes together.

07:53.542 --> 07:54.416
The A-Team.

07:54.583 --> 07:55.957
I got it.

07:56.667 --> 07:57.791
I said no, Jules.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.374
Don't push. I gave you a deal.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.332
20 euros for a half-ounce,

08:02.500 --> 08:03.999
in Paris it goes for 80.

08:04.208 --> 08:05.582
You win. 200.

08:06.333 --> 08:06.957
Here.

08:07.125 --> 08:08.249
It's not always cut rate!

08:17.292 --> 08:19.707
I'll take 10 ounces, please.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.499
I don't sell so you can deal.

08:22.667 --> 08:23.999
I'm not in business.

08:24.333 --> 08:24.999
What?

08:25.167 --> 08:26.332
Why what?

08:26.750 --> 08:27.707
We're a local group,

08:28.125 --> 08:31.541
we get together,
compare growing techniques.

08:31.708 --> 08:33.666
It's our hobby. Understand?

08:33.832 --> 08:35.874
- That's great but I...
- Yeah, it's great.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.291
No problem, but it's not to sell.

08:38.457 --> 08:40.124
It's for my personal use.

08:40.292 --> 08:41.374
You shitting me?

08:41.542 --> 08:42.999
You smoke 15 joints a day?

08:43.207 --> 08:43.999
17.

08:51.708 --> 08:52.582
Thanks, Gerard.

08:53.958 --> 08:55.166
He's nuts.

08:55.875 --> 08:56.916
Nothing for you?

08:58.042 --> 08:59.082
- Who, me?
- Yes, you!

09:01.167 --> 09:04.082
I'm an actor, so my body's my tool.

09:04.375 --> 09:07.999
But I figure some day
I might try a joint and check out

09:08.167 --> 09:09.749
the Actor's Studio trip...

09:09.958 --> 09:11.916
to experience it like Daniel...

09:12.375 --> 09:13.499
Day Lewis.

09:13.833 --> 09:14.916
The guy walks away...

09:15.167 --> 09:17.791
Seriously?
In the middle of my sentence.

09:18.583 --> 09:20.832
He saw you weren't a customer.

09:21.375 --> 09:22.124
That's awful!

09:25.083 --> 09:26.916
Farmer's hooch, it burns!

09:28.417 --> 09:29.874
Man!

09:30.333 --> 09:32.041
- She's so gorgeous!
- Who?

09:32.208 --> 09:34.124
Julia! I didn't tell you.

09:34.417 --> 09:35.666
It was so awkward.

09:35.833 --> 09:38.082
We were just smoking a joint.

09:38.542 --> 09:40.749
I say, "C'mon, do me a blowback."

09:40.917 --> 09:43.666
She says no.
I say "Please, do me a blowback."

09:43.833 --> 09:44.457
She agrees,

09:44.792 --> 09:45.957
turns the joint around,

09:46.125 --> 09:47.791
and when she leans in

09:47.958 --> 09:49.999
my palms are wet, I get shivers,

09:51.292 --> 09:53.291
and a stiffy! Believe it?

09:53.458 --> 09:55.666
You serious? She's like our sister!

09:55.833 --> 09:56.749
I know, man.

09:56.958 --> 09:58.082
I was so embarrassed.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.749
But I had such a boner.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.207
I was like this,

10:02.375 --> 10:02.999
my fly

10:03.333 --> 10:06.249
was gonna pop any second.

10:06.417 --> 10:07.791
This big bump in my jeans.

10:07.958 --> 10:09.457
I was in a bad way...

10:09.625 --> 10:12.166
A half woody

10:12.333 --> 10:13.416
going sideways...

10:14.333 --> 10:15.291
I'll spare the details.

10:15.708 --> 10:17.666
Imagine the mess
if you slept with Julia.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.541
I know man, but it was sincere.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.249
A sincere boner.

10:25.583 --> 10:26.582
Okay, pal?

10:28.000 --> 10:30.124
Man, am I in the mood to copulate.

10:31.417 --> 10:32.249
He's sick.

10:32.542 --> 10:33.666
Look at that girl.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.249
I want to make love to her,

10:36.750 --> 10:37.666
just to see.

10:39.917 --> 10:40.832
What's so funny?

10:41.958 --> 10:42.916
What's so funny?

10:44.375 --> 10:47.082
Because you already did,
it makes me laugh.

10:47.542 --> 10:48.707
A good joke.

10:51.375 --> 10:52.332
You're right!

10:52.583 --> 10:53.207
You forgot?

10:53.375 --> 10:55.082
I totally forgot.

10:55.958 --> 10:57.416
The guy's insane. He forgets!

10:57.583 --> 10:58.624
Julia, c'mere.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.332
Lemme borrow her a sec.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.166
Hear ye, hear ye,

11:05.042 --> 11:06.499
villeins and damsels,

11:06.667 --> 11:07.499
half-breeds

11:07.667 --> 11:08.707
and hash-smokers,

11:08.875 --> 11:11.166
fall at my feet,

11:11.583 --> 11:13.916
for I have found us
a keep, nay, a castle,

11:14.083 --> 11:15.166
what says he?

11:15.333 --> 11:17.457
A fucking apartment!

11:17.625 --> 11:19.582
- What?
- 5 bedrooms, top floor,

11:19.792 --> 11:21.332
balcony, open kitchen,

11:21.500 --> 11:22.624
huge living room, elevator,

11:23.083 --> 11:24.332
can you beat that?

11:24.500 --> 11:25.624
Vadim, why shake your head?

11:25.792 --> 11:27.582
It'll cost a fortune!

11:27.875 --> 11:31.207
The sweet sound of the killjoy
who ruins the mood.

11:31.375 --> 11:34.166
I'm not. But I can't pay 2000 euros.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.874
You won't! How much can you pay?

11:37.083 --> 11:38.041
We said 500.

11:38.208 --> 11:39.666
You know what?

11:39.833 --> 11:41.082
You each pay 500.

11:41.250 --> 11:42.666
That makes 2000.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.832
Trust me, I'll pay the rest.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.291
And we'll finally
have a place to share!

11:52.375 --> 11:53.499
My lunch!

11:59.083 --> 11:59.999
Tornado!

12:15.667 --> 12:16.332
Nice molding.

12:16.708 --> 12:18.957
Yes... molding...

12:19.250 --> 12:20.416
It's molding.

12:21.042 --> 12:22.207
He'll be here any minute.

12:24.417 --> 12:25.177
He's a little late.

12:28.917 --> 12:30.332
Shit, I overslept!

12:31.667 --> 12:33.624
Perfect. Sorry again for being late.

12:33.792 --> 12:35.666
Tough surgery this morning,

12:35.833 --> 12:36.999
I had to pitch in.

12:37.167 --> 12:40.541
That's hospitals! The beeper going,
the gurney breaks,

12:40.750 --> 12:42.874
the EKG won't start,

12:43.042 --> 12:44.832
a tough morning in ER.

12:45.042 --> 12:46.082
Never mind.

12:46.250 --> 12:46.874
I'll stop.

12:47.042 --> 12:49.707
Your application
was very weak, but...

12:51.292 --> 12:54.457
But I know your father well,
so I bent the rules.

12:54.625 --> 12:55.916
Thanks, that's very kind.

12:56.583 --> 12:57.499
Moreover,

12:57.958 --> 13:00.499
are you aware
the lease is in your name?

13:01.917 --> 13:04.124
I know. That won't be a problem.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.707
Well then, let's sign.

13:07.042 --> 13:08.124
The signature!

13:11.792 --> 13:12.791
Where do I sign?

13:12.958 --> 13:14.124
There... and there.

13:19.333 --> 13:20.291
Fine.

13:23.875 --> 13:25.499
- The keys.
- Right, the keys.

13:29.083 --> 13:30.999
So, did we do it or didn't we?

13:31.167 --> 13:31.874
We sure did it!

13:32.042 --> 13:34.249
I hope it's cool. I gave up my flat.

13:34.417 --> 13:36.749
What wouldn't be cool?
We have the keys.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.582
The place is sensational.

13:38.750 --> 13:39.916
You're a damn genius.

13:40.083 --> 13:42.291
In fact, we got you a gift.

13:42.458 --> 13:43.082
Honestly?

13:44.333 --> 13:45.207
"Sam's treat."

13:45.375 --> 13:47.207
Funny, isn't it?
Pretty cool.

13:47.375 --> 13:48.291
Thanks so much.

13:48.625 --> 13:49.957
You treat us.

13:50.125 --> 13:52.582
Let's tie one on tonight. I'm ready!

13:52.750 --> 13:55.624
Not tonight. Dad's birthday tomorrow.

13:55.792 --> 13:56.957
And rehearsal.

13:57.125 --> 13:58.582
Not helping us move?

13:58.750 --> 14:01.374
Sure, but tonight
I gotta take it easy.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.207
There, that's better.

14:13.667 --> 14:14.624
That's better.

14:15.125 --> 14:17.457
I've been to lots of doctors

14:17.625 --> 14:20.082
for my problem.
They've found nothing.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.291
Here,

14:21.458 --> 14:23.124
I'll show you

14:23.292 --> 14:25.666
Not only does it itch,

14:25.833 --> 14:28.041
but it keeps oozing pus.

14:28.208 --> 14:29.791
- Look!
- I'm looking.

14:30.750 --> 14:31.666
Holy cow!

14:31.833 --> 14:32.957
I saw, I see.

14:33.458 --> 14:34.541
What is it?

14:34.708 --> 14:37.582
I see. You've got a fagnus.

14:37.750 --> 14:38.957
What's a fagnus?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.124
A little like eczema.

14:42.542 --> 14:44.874
But yours has pus.

14:45.042 --> 14:46.707
You have the kind with pus.

14:46.958 --> 14:48.749
It's a real bother!

14:48.917 --> 14:50.874
Sure it's a bother,

14:51.500 --> 14:52.457
for everyone.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.582
Check her out, man!

15:04.750 --> 15:07.541
The concierge's daughter.
She's eying me.

15:07.708 --> 15:09.457
Every time I go by.

15:09.625 --> 15:12.082
She's not my type.

15:13.083 --> 15:14.624
You have a type?

15:15.917 --> 15:17.457
I kinda like her.

15:19.375 --> 15:20.666
Cut the racket!

15:20.833 --> 15:22.749
Sorry for moving in.

15:22.917 --> 15:24.332
That's not my problem.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.999
I've got my eye on you.

15:26.167 --> 15:28.374
It's forbidden to use the elevator.

15:28.542 --> 15:29.582
Sure. Out of the way.

15:29.833 --> 15:31.374
Go piss on your hands, you mutt!

15:31.542 --> 15:32.582
Take it easy, Jules.

15:32.750 --> 15:34.541
You pussy out in a second.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.499
- But don't...
- I will!

15:36.667 --> 15:37.874
He'll hassle us.

15:41.375 --> 15:42.416
Down you go!

15:44.333 --> 15:45.874
- What're you doing?
- What?

15:46.042 --> 15:48.124
What if someone walks in?

15:48.417 --> 15:49.957
I dunno, we tell 'em.

15:50.542 --> 15:53.374
We can't hide
now that we all live together.

15:53.542 --> 15:55.374
Hold your horses.

15:55.625 --> 15:57.791
I don't want it to mess up the gang.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.166
If we keep using rubbers,
we're not telling.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.374
That's different.

16:02.542 --> 16:04.249
No it's not. Dammit, Vad!

16:04.583 --> 16:07.124
Hey! I'm on the pill, we did tests,

16:07.292 --> 16:09.499
and you treat me like a piece of ass.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.541
It's just that
I'm not sure tests are reliable.

16:14.292 --> 16:16.332
Here they are, the bastards!

16:16.500 --> 16:18.749
Taking a break? I'm hot to trot!

16:21.083 --> 16:22.874
Enough...

16:23.042 --> 16:24.207
Cut it out!

16:28.833 --> 16:29.624
I'm okay.

16:29.833 --> 16:33.207
You doctors are lucky.
You put us right at ease.

16:33.458 --> 16:36.457
Never could I talk about
my vaginal dryness

16:36.625 --> 16:38.124
if you weren't a doctor.

16:38.792 --> 16:40.999
Yes, for that, we're lucky.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.541
You sure are.

16:45.375 --> 16:46.749
My husband's ill!

16:46.917 --> 16:48.374
My son's a doctor. Sam!

16:48.542 --> 16:49.582
Hurry!

16:49.750 --> 16:50.541
A doctor, quick!

16:51.208 --> 16:52.707
- What's going on?
- A seizure.

16:54.917 --> 16:55.832
So...

16:56.000 --> 16:57.832
He doesn't look too good.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.624
Move back, please.

16:59.833 --> 17:01.166
Let him breathe.

17:01.958 --> 17:03.207
Blood gas okay...

17:03.917 --> 17:05.957
Pulse, not bad.

17:06.833 --> 17:08.499
Pupils dilated.

17:08.666 --> 17:09.457
Right?

17:09.875 --> 17:11.040
- I don't know.
- Never mind.

17:11.583 --> 17:13.915
Now the fetal safety position,

17:14.083 --> 17:16.290
so that he'll be okay.

17:16.541 --> 17:18.540
- So far, so good.
- Mouth to mouth.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.374
- What?
- Mouth to mouth.

17:20.541 --> 17:22.874
Not at all. That's an urban legend.

17:23.041 --> 17:23.915
Totally wrong.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.665
We'll wake him up.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.249
Wake up, mister.

17:27.791 --> 17:29.999
Mouth to mouth has worked before!

17:30.208 --> 17:32.791
If you want, okay.

17:33.417 --> 17:34.207
Here we go.

17:34.375 --> 17:36.999
You sure? I can hear him breathing.

17:37.167 --> 17:39.332
Mouth to mouth might be redundant.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.124
- Go on!
- Mouth to mouth.

17:41.292 --> 17:43.249
- Do something!
- I'm doing my best.

17:45.375 --> 17:46.249
Here we go.

17:50.917 --> 17:52.582
This is serious.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.041
It's serious.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.916
I'm not a doctor.
Call someone!

17:56.083 --> 17:57.457
I'm not a doctor.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.166
For 3 years, dammit!

18:06.333 --> 18:07.457
3 years!

18:08.167 --> 18:10.582
How long were you going
to keep up the charade?

18:10.750 --> 18:12.791
It wasn't a charade.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.249
Me paying for you to pretend

18:15.417 --> 18:18.332
to go to med school isn't a charade?

18:18.500 --> 18:19.666
I had no choice!

18:19.833 --> 18:21.999
I want to act, that's my thing.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.457
No choice?

18:23.625 --> 18:25.374
How about the truth?

18:25.542 --> 18:27.041
You ever tell the truth?

18:27.208 --> 18:30.457
What would I gain?
You never believed in it.

18:30.625 --> 18:33.499
You never thought
it was a real dream,

18:33.667 --> 18:35.332
something I could do!

18:35.500 --> 18:36.666
You'd never have agreed.

18:36.833 --> 18:39.541
Look at me
and say you'd have approved.

18:39.875 --> 18:43.457
Quit the sob story
of the unloved son.

18:43.625 --> 18:44.624
I'll slap you.

18:44.917 --> 18:46.238
Go on, maybe it'll change things.

18:52.417 --> 18:54.124
Making me look like a fool

18:54.417 --> 18:55.791
in front of my friends!

18:56.792 --> 18:58.082
Give me your wallet.

18:59.417 --> 19:00.041
What?

19:00.208 --> 19:01.957
Give it to me!

19:10.375 --> 19:12.666
See how you do with a debit card.

19:13.917 --> 19:14.999
You serious?

19:16.250 --> 19:19.249
That all you care about,
not giving me money?

19:20.333 --> 19:23.582
Not only will I never give you
another cent,

19:24.333 --> 19:27.582
but I hope I never see
your stupid mug again.

20:03.125 --> 20:04.249
Finally!

20:04.625 --> 20:05.624
Hey, man.

20:05.792 --> 20:08.249
Your party not too much of a drag?

20:08.958 --> 20:10.707
It was okay.

20:11.333 --> 20:12.291
What's the matter?

20:16.208 --> 20:16.874
Actually...

20:17.042 --> 20:18.624
Sam, c'mon! We've been waiting.

20:19.292 --> 20:20.457
I'm coming, guys.

20:20.625 --> 20:21.707
You got troubles?

20:29.167 --> 20:31.957
Nope, no trouble. I'm just tired.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.124
Thank you, Sam!

20:37.292 --> 20:38.749
Give him a drink.

20:39.708 --> 20:40.916
Yeppa!

20:43.292 --> 20:44.374
Here's to you.

20:44.625 --> 20:47.082
I'm running late. Sorry.

20:52.458 --> 20:53.374
It's okay.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.124
It's open!

21:01.292 --> 21:02.666
I'm in the living room.

21:13.250 --> 21:14.832
Sorry, I'm late.

21:15.083 --> 21:16.499
I noticed.

21:21.208 --> 21:24.207
I don't think
I can work on a scene today.

21:25.625 --> 21:28.332
I can't even get my lines down.
But what's wrong?

21:30.042 --> 21:31.999
Since when do you smoke that?

21:34.208 --> 21:35.374
Since I've needed it.

21:35.833 --> 21:36.832
Meaning?

21:37.375 --> 21:38.832
None of your business.

21:41.167 --> 21:43.791
So what's wrong?
Why don't you want to work?

21:48.750 --> 21:50.582
I had a fight with my dad.

21:51.125 --> 21:54.082
Ls that all?
I thought it was serious.

21:54.250 --> 21:57.291
Well, it is pretty serious.

21:57.792 --> 21:59.832
He never wants to see me again.

22:02.500 --> 22:03.957
You know what they say?

22:05.750 --> 22:08.832
When the family's gone,
you still have your friends.

22:12.333 --> 22:14.874
Do friends stay
when you let them down?

22:15.042 --> 22:15.999
Yes.

22:17.750 --> 22:19.082
Real friends do.

23:02.042 --> 23:04.124
Kilo, over there!

23:13.500 --> 23:15.082
No, Kilo!

23:17.625 --> 23:18.874
Beat it.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.832
- Have a nice evening.
- You, too.

24:22.667 --> 24:24.332
I'll get your car, Ms. Ardant.

24:24.500 --> 24:27.041
Do you mind if Samuel handles it?

24:27.208 --> 24:28.374
No, no problem.

24:28.542 --> 24:30.499
- He knows it well.
- I understand.

24:33.208 --> 24:35.374
I'll get it right away.

24:35.917 --> 24:36.916
Thank you.

24:55.417 --> 24:56.624
Have a nice evening.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.624
The dame gets a million per film
and not even a tip!

25:11.833 --> 25:13.332
Did she tip you?

25:15.792 --> 25:16.916
Tightwad.

25:17.458 --> 25:19.374
Don't exaggerate. You can't judge.

25:19.542 --> 25:22.624
- Tightwad.
- Okay, she's a tightwad.

25:28.583 --> 25:30.624
- How's it going?
- Okay, and you?

25:30.958 --> 25:32.124
- Here.
- Great.

25:32.292 --> 25:34.041
Not a word to the others.

25:34.208 --> 25:36.207
And not a word to my dad.

25:44.875 --> 25:46.166
No, I'm busy!

25:47.125 --> 25:48.957
- C'mon. Open up.
- I'm busy, man!

25:49.667 --> 25:51.374
- Open up!
- I said I'm busy.

25:52.625 --> 25:54.332
Open up, dammit!

25:55.042 --> 25:56.041
What d'you want?

26:00.417 --> 26:01.374
Jerkin' the gherkin?

26:02.417 --> 26:04.207
No, I'm not "jerkin' the gherkin."

26:04.708 --> 26:05.749
Then why lock the door?

26:06.167 --> 26:09.207
I can't want privacy
if I'm not masturbating?

26:09.625 --> 26:11.666
No, so let me in.

26:11.875 --> 26:14.457
- Why not?
- Okay, I'm beating off.

26:15.375 --> 26:18.082
You're jerking off.
And about to finish up.

26:18.542 --> 26:20.624
You got a stiffy?

26:20.792 --> 26:21.749
What porn do you use?

26:22.125 --> 26:23.332
"Jacquie et Michel" is great.

26:23.500 --> 26:24.957
No, nothing wild.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.624
A threesome in POV

26:27.792 --> 26:30.541
with busty milfs. I'm at the cumshot.

26:30.708 --> 26:31.999
- Nice!
- There you are.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.457
Way to go!

26:33.917 --> 26:34.999
The chicks hot?

26:35.250 --> 26:36.707
Dogs! Ugly chicks.

26:37.542 --> 26:39.999
- So why?
- I'm joking. Of course they're hot.

26:40.167 --> 26:42.291
Go check the fridge for a surprise.

26:42.458 --> 26:43.207
Really?

26:43.542 --> 26:45.041
- What is it?
- Go look.

26:45.208 --> 26:46.374
Another treat?

26:46.542 --> 26:47.582
Go look, champ.

26:47.750 --> 26:48.957
World champion!

27:03.375 --> 27:04.832
Thank you, Sam!

27:05.000 --> 27:07.124
What a beaut! Hot damn!

27:07.292 --> 27:08.832
I'll make you a colombo

27:09.000 --> 27:11.249
that'll knock your socks off.

27:11.417 --> 27:12.291
Here we go.

27:42.583 --> 27:44.041
And with this,

27:44.583 --> 27:46.082
Parkinson's my ass!

27:47.042 --> 27:48.207
Look.

27:49.375 --> 27:50.749
It works well.

27:51.542 --> 27:52.332
You know,

27:52.500 --> 27:56.082
more and more hospital patients
are smoking it with me.

27:56.250 --> 27:57.374
Really?

27:57.958 --> 27:59.166
You bet.

28:01.375 --> 28:02.707
Listen,

28:03.083 --> 28:04.166
apart from that,

28:04.625 --> 28:07.457
any progress with Maia?

28:07.917 --> 28:11.249
I wouldn't say progress.

28:11.917 --> 28:13.499
Call it a preliminary stage...

28:13.958 --> 28:15.707
Get on with it!

28:16.083 --> 28:18.707
Or someone else'll get the...

28:21.125 --> 28:22.999
Don't make such a face.

28:23.167 --> 28:25.457
Make no mistake:

28:25.625 --> 28:27.791
If you hesitate, you'll lose her.

28:27.958 --> 28:31.082
But you don't have to do
your Marceau dick mime.

28:33.875 --> 28:35.332
Hear me out.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.791
For 6 months
I hid my passion and fled.

28:38.167 --> 28:40.207
I fled from you and suffered so.

28:40.375 --> 28:42.541
These men mean nothing to me.

28:43.167 --> 28:44.499
I love you.

28:45.000 --> 28:45.832
Oh, my God!

28:46.000 --> 28:48.832
How dare I speak so to your majesty?
What can I do?

28:49.208 --> 28:50.374
Order me to die

28:50.542 --> 28:51.749
and I will die.

28:52.208 --> 28:53.416
My heart is filled with dread.

28:53.958 --> 28:54.999
Forgive me.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.916
Oh! Don't stop!

28:57.083 --> 28:58.916
Ravish me!

28:59.083 --> 29:01.957
No one has ever spoken to me so.

29:02.125 --> 29:04.082
I'm listening.

29:10.208 --> 29:12.707
Camille, it's Sam. Just to say

29:12.875 --> 29:14.291
I sold all the meat,

29:14.458 --> 29:17.207
so it would be good
to meet this week.

29:18.208 --> 29:19.207
Maia?

29:22.083 --> 29:23.707
What's going on?

29:23.875 --> 29:25.832
- What is it?
- I'm okay.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.332
I just get nosebleeds when I'm moved.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.666
That's a new one.

29:31.833 --> 29:34.791
You were great on that scene tonight.

29:34.958 --> 29:36.207
You liked it?

29:36.375 --> 29:37.041
Yeah.

29:39.292 --> 29:41.791
We ought to work on it together.

29:42.375 --> 29:43.332
Together,

29:44.833 --> 29:45.791
both of us?

29:45.958 --> 29:47.374
Yeah, sure.

29:47.542 --> 29:48.832
I totally want to.

29:49.125 --> 29:51.332
- You and me.
- Yes, totally you and me.

29:51.667 --> 29:55.707
I've got your number,
so call me and we'll make a date.

29:55.875 --> 29:59.082
If you've got my number,
why don't you call me?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.874
Even better. Much smarter.

30:03.042 --> 30:04.832
Obvious, in fact.

30:05.708 --> 30:07.374
I'll call, and that's that.

30:07.958 --> 30:10.332
You answer and say yes or no.

30:10.500 --> 30:14.374
In fact, you answer, or you don't.
I don't want to interfere.

30:14.542 --> 30:15.832
Will you answer?

30:16.000 --> 30:19.041
I'm joking. It's not the best joke...

30:20.917 --> 30:22.416
Each is free...

30:28.792 --> 30:30.166
- So...
- I'll be going.

30:30.333 --> 30:31.999
I'm going, too.

30:32.333 --> 30:33.374
So long.

30:36.292 --> 30:38.541
I've got a scooter.
Want me to ride you?

30:38.708 --> 30:39.916
I mean, give you a ride?

30:40.083 --> 30:42.332
Totally! That'd be sweet.

30:42.500 --> 30:44.749
I love scooters. You get all the...

30:44.917 --> 30:48.166
Yeah, great sensations.
Shit! No helmet.

30:49.208 --> 30:50.791
Never mind.

30:51.167 --> 30:52.249
So I'll go...

30:52.417 --> 30:54.124
- On foot.
- I'll walk home.

30:55.292 --> 30:56.457
'Bye.

31:01.833 --> 31:02.957
Tell me, love.

31:03.417 --> 31:04.291
What?

31:04.458 --> 31:06.832
Ls your esthetician on the lam?

31:07.000 --> 31:08.916
What makes you say that?

31:09.083 --> 31:11.666
It's a bit messy around the bush.

31:12.208 --> 31:14.624
Take a look at yourself!
It's an Afro!

31:15.000 --> 31:16.582
I like your hair,

31:17.042 --> 31:20.124
but I can't even see the subtitles
when you're near me.

31:20.708 --> 31:21.332
Very funny.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.041
Out of solidarity,

31:23.208 --> 31:25.124
I'm willing to get a trim.

31:26.083 --> 31:29.041
I can't decide what style, though.

31:29.792 --> 31:30.916
Maybe a blow-dry,

31:31.792 --> 31:33.999
sort of uptown class.

31:34.167 --> 31:37.499
Or more exotic and daring,

31:37.792 --> 31:40.582
a goatee like Jafar's under the nuts,

31:40.750 --> 31:41.791
old-style.

31:41.958 --> 31:43.124
Very funny.

31:43.292 --> 31:46.374
Like the Barber of Seville.
It'd be funny.

31:50.833 --> 31:54.624
Thinking of you, Julia. Big hugs.

31:57.875 --> 31:58.832
Delete

32:03.333 --> 32:05.499
Look, I tidied it up.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.707
She surely thought it was a bad idea.

32:12.750 --> 32:14.291
It jeopardized your friendship.

32:14.458 --> 32:15.457
Think so?

32:15.625 --> 32:19.124
Definitely. Now play it cool.

32:19.292 --> 32:21.541
Forget you sent that text.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.457
I was ready to go on the offensive.

32:25.708 --> 32:26.957
To shut her up like this...

32:30.667 --> 32:31.999
And kiss her.

32:32.167 --> 32:33.124
I'd move my fingers.

32:33.292 --> 32:36.041
Cool it with Julia.
It'll mess things up.

32:36.208 --> 32:38.749
Try the concierge's daughter.
She likes you.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.624
I'm trying, but it's tough going.

32:44.667 --> 32:45.666
You're home?

32:47.167 --> 32:50.082
This is Maia, guys.

32:50.250 --> 32:51.666
Timothy... My pleasure.

32:51.833 --> 32:53.249
Relax.

32:53.417 --> 32:56.707
It stinks in here. Something awful.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.207
Let's go to my room.

33:03.083 --> 33:04.666
Think he's doing her?

33:05.583 --> 33:07.166
That's the babe from the theater.

33:07.333 --> 33:10.999
A serenade, he'll touch her earlobe,
and they're in raptures.

33:11.167 --> 33:13.124
Right, little serenades and...

33:13.292 --> 33:16.457
He'll say stuff like,
"Sir, don't you..."

33:16.625 --> 33:18.207
I get the picture.

33:18.667 --> 33:19.957
I love you.

33:21.583 --> 33:25.374
How dare I speak so to your majesty?
What can I do?

33:26.000 --> 33:27.874
You don't know what a serenade is.

33:29.750 --> 33:32.082
Order me to die and I will die.

33:33.083 --> 33:34.791
My heart is filled with dread.

33:35.333 --> 33:36.541
Forgive me.

33:37.125 --> 33:38.332
Don't stop.

33:38.792 --> 33:40.082
Ravish me.

33:40.625 --> 33:43.041
No one has ever spoken to me so.

33:43.333 --> 33:44.207
I'm listening.

33:44.625 --> 33:47.957
Your soul speaks to me
and overwhelms me so.

33:48.208 --> 33:49.999
I need your eyes,

33:50.625 --> 33:52.291
I need your voice.

33:52.750 --> 33:53.499
I...

33:55.833 --> 33:57.374
What is it?

34:00.250 --> 34:01.249
Nothing.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.749
There's nothing.

34:22.958 --> 34:24.248
Man, you called?

34:24.833 --> 34:26.916
What's that stink at the house?

34:27.208 --> 34:30.166
Sorry, it's the hash I'm smoking.
It reeks.

34:30.333 --> 34:33.706
But hang on. I went in your room.
What's the deal?

34:33.875 --> 34:35.873
The blood! You slaughter a sheep?

34:36.042 --> 34:37.206
First, man,

34:37.375 --> 34:39.541
never go in my room. Got that?

34:39.708 --> 34:43.748
Second, the blood is Maia's.
She had a problem.

34:43.917 --> 34:45.748
Wait. Since when d'you smoke

34:45.917 --> 34:46.706
hash?

34:46.875 --> 34:51.581
Gerard can't sell us grass any more,
so the hash is to tide me over.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.416
Did she have her period?

34:53.583 --> 34:55.123
Blood on the sheets!

34:55.292 --> 34:57.541
Why can't Gerard sell grass?
What's up?

34:57.708 --> 34:58.791
Because

34:58.958 --> 35:01.624
the guy got his barn cleaned out.

35:01.792 --> 35:05.124
That's what they said.
Was she a virgin?

35:05.375 --> 35:07.082
Is that it?

35:07.250 --> 35:08.499
Better yet:

35:08.750 --> 35:10.124
you cornholed her.

35:10.583 --> 35:12.791
You cornholed her, right?

35:15.875 --> 35:17.166
Man!

35:17.333 --> 35:19.749
Bumfucks her and hangs up on me!

35:20.458 --> 35:23.999
You've reached Camille's cell.
I'm not available.

35:24.542 --> 35:26.999
Where do I park Mr. Renato's car?

35:27.167 --> 35:28.327
- I'll park it.
- I can do it.

35:28.458 --> 35:30.041
Leave it. Move!

35:37.125 --> 35:38.166
Camille?

36:00.083 --> 36:01.374
See the mess?

36:02.583 --> 36:03.624
What happened?

36:03.792 --> 36:05.999
They cleaned us out. We're done.

36:06.167 --> 36:07.916
Didn't leave us an ounce!

36:08.375 --> 36:09.999
What am I gonna do?

36:10.167 --> 36:12.707
It'll take 6 months to grow more.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.791
I'm sorry.

36:45.833 --> 36:46.916
Hi Timothy.

36:47.667 --> 36:49.082
I'm fine. And you?

36:49.458 --> 36:50.832
- How's it going?
- And you?

36:56.500 --> 36:57.332
Great.

36:59.083 --> 37:00.249
Later!

37:00.417 --> 37:01.207
Take care.

37:04.500 --> 37:05.499
Mr. Limoges?

37:05.667 --> 37:07.332
Enough!

37:07.500 --> 37:09.499
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

37:09.667 --> 37:13.249
It's 9:25 p.m., that's what.
It's too loud!

37:13.417 --> 37:15.999
It's not late for normal folks.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.166
I don't give a shit!

37:18.333 --> 37:21.207
Tell your pals to turn it down.

37:21.375 --> 37:22.499
I'll tell them.

37:22.667 --> 37:24.249
"Normal folks"!

37:25.208 --> 37:26.749
Have a nice evening, anyway.

37:28.667 --> 37:30.249
Yeah, right!

37:33.042 --> 37:35.374
I want to order pizza.

37:36.167 --> 37:38.666
Mr. Limoges. I have an account.

37:39.125 --> 37:40.916
So I'll take 10 pizzas,

37:41.083 --> 37:44.666
with extra tuna, sausage, pineapple,

37:44.833 --> 37:46.082
that's right...

37:46.500 --> 37:47.707
double pepperoni.

37:54.042 --> 37:55.541
Turn it down! The neighbor!

37:56.083 --> 37:58.207
Okay, I'll turn it down.

37:59.500 --> 38:02.166
Come out of there. The door's locked.

38:02.958 --> 38:04.874
Silly! When'll we tell 'em?

38:05.042 --> 38:07.124
How long we gonna play this game?

38:07.792 --> 38:09.249
I'm not ready yet.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.832
We stopped using condoms
2 months ago.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.624
My dick's the one taking risks.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.166
- Cut it out.
- You promised!

38:16.542 --> 38:17.499
You're a pain.

38:17.667 --> 38:18.749
I'm a pain?

38:18.917 --> 38:21.666
I'm the one with my dick
under the fur.

38:22.042 --> 38:24.207
Don't laugh, dammit!

38:28.625 --> 38:30.791
He's starting to piss me off.

38:30.958 --> 38:32.416
We turned it down!

38:32.583 --> 38:34.791
That's enough, we turned down...

38:34.958 --> 38:36.582
Sorry, I thought it was...

38:36.917 --> 38:37.999
What is it?

38:38.833 --> 38:39.666
The pizza.

38:39.833 --> 38:42.582
I didn't order pizza.

38:42.750 --> 38:44.874
He said the same downstairs.
What is this?

38:46.250 --> 38:47.124
I'll call

38:47.292 --> 38:49.707
because something's not right.

38:50.083 --> 38:52.916
Call, because I didn't order pizza.

38:53.458 --> 38:56.832
Who in the building
could've ordered...

38:57.000 --> 38:58.624
Maybe on the third?

39:00.917 --> 39:01.874
What do I owe?

39:02.500 --> 39:04.457
215.43 euros.

39:04.625 --> 39:06.249
Ouch! The card machine, please.

39:08.250 --> 39:09.416
I'll have a piece.

39:10.958 --> 39:12.416
Maybe it's not the...

39:15.500 --> 39:17.499
What's this awful pizza?

39:20.292 --> 39:21.666
Thank you.

39:25.917 --> 39:27.582
This is Mr. Bastien,

39:27.750 --> 39:28.874
the realtor.

39:29.042 --> 39:33.666
I was just informed that
the last direct debit was refused.

39:33.833 --> 39:37.374
I tried to reach your father
but he didn't return my calls.

39:37.542 --> 39:40.249
Please contact me
as soon as possible.

39:45.042 --> 39:46.416
You're home?

39:47.083 --> 39:48.416
What're you up to?

39:49.625 --> 39:50.582
Nothing.

39:50.958 --> 39:54.666
Did you all pay
your share of the rent this month?

39:55.542 --> 39:57.082
Totally. A problem?

39:57.250 --> 39:59.999
No, just to be sure.

40:01.000 --> 40:01.832
Hey, bro,

40:02.542 --> 40:03.582
you sure you're okay?

40:03.750 --> 40:05.207
Yeah, totally.

40:07.208 --> 40:08.791
Ls Nestor home?

40:09.250 --> 40:11.249
He got home early from the library.

40:55.458 --> 40:58.041
Not a single ring! Pain in the ass.

40:58.208 --> 41:00.749
Quit muttering and pay up.

41:00.917 --> 41:04.374
You bet on the wrong horse
and you pay. That's life.

41:04.542 --> 41:07.124
If you don't win you don't buy lunch?

41:07.292 --> 41:08.332
Relax, I'll pay.

41:08.500 --> 41:09.874
Why? Sam usually pays.

41:10.042 --> 41:11.082
What's your problem?

41:11.250 --> 41:14.124
No lunch, no pals?
You just like my money?

41:14.500 --> 41:15.749
I didn't say that.

41:15.917 --> 41:18.332
You didn't? Then shut up!

41:18.958 --> 41:20.249
You bust my balls.

41:20.667 --> 41:23.749
I pay when I want to,
I don't when I don't. Got that?

41:23.917 --> 41:25.749
Relax. Can't we kid around?

41:25.917 --> 41:27.249
Why the huff? You okay?

41:28.042 --> 41:30.499
I'm fine. I'm going for a walk.

41:31.417 --> 41:33.499
Can't we joke any more?

41:35.583 --> 41:37.166
Is he serious?

41:38.042 --> 41:39.374
Why the hissy fit?

42:00.667 --> 42:02.249
- How goes it?
- Hey, buddy.

42:02.417 --> 42:03.874
- I'm almost done.
- I'll wait.

42:06.292 --> 42:07.374
Nice going.

42:08.042 --> 42:09.124
That's it.

42:13.292 --> 42:15.416
You left all pissed. What's up?

42:17.208 --> 42:19.624
That's what I want to talk about.

42:25.125 --> 42:25.957
Here.

42:26.125 --> 42:27.082
Thanks.

42:27.875 --> 42:30.457
I'll shower and we'll grab a bite.
I'm starved.

42:34.542 --> 42:35.916
I'll wait...

42:37.250 --> 42:39.541
Outside. I'll wait outside.

42:42.417 --> 42:44.249
Why didn't you just tell us?

42:45.333 --> 42:47.541
I dunno, coz the place is awesome,

42:47.708 --> 42:50.957
it was our dream.
I didn't want to spoil it all.

42:52.292 --> 42:55.416
I promised,
and I wanted it to be perfect.

42:56.125 --> 42:57.291
But man,

42:57.875 --> 43:00.124
sometimes things aren't perfect
and it's okay.

43:02.042 --> 43:06.082
As long as Camille
was selling me grass, it was fine.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.916
I could stay afloat,
but now I'm in deep shit.

43:10.500 --> 43:11.582
I can't eat this.

43:11.750 --> 43:13.541
The sauce is like fire.

43:13.875 --> 43:15.416
I like it hot, but damn!

43:15.833 --> 43:17.624
You listening?

43:18.292 --> 43:21.041
It's clear:
You gotta tell the others.

43:21.208 --> 43:23.332
No, why tell them

43:23.625 --> 43:27.749
and pile failure on failure?
We gotta get back on top.

43:27.917 --> 43:30.666
I'm a winner, so are you.
Listen! What are you?

43:30.833 --> 43:31.791
Sick. I feel sick.

43:32.083 --> 43:34.707
I'm talking about something bigger.

43:34.875 --> 43:35.749
What is?

43:36.542 --> 43:37.916
Let's go in together.

43:38.417 --> 43:41.041
We find a dealer,
a guy to sell us grass.

43:41.208 --> 43:45.041
You smoke all you want,
we sell the rest 50-50.

43:46.292 --> 43:47.832
I smoke all I want?

43:48.292 --> 43:49.374
All you want.

43:53.583 --> 43:56.041
I gotta think it over.

43:56.208 --> 43:58.374
Take your time. 2, 3 days.

43:58.750 --> 44:00.124
Let's do it! I'm game.

44:00.292 --> 44:01.541
What a team!

44:01.708 --> 44:02.957
I smoke all I want!

44:03.125 --> 44:04.624
But watch out.

44:05.250 --> 44:07.541
Not a word to the others.

44:07.708 --> 44:08.916
No screw ups.

44:09.583 --> 44:10.374
I'm not dumb.

44:12.667 --> 44:13.749
No screw ups.

44:17.125 --> 44:18.666
Something stinks.

44:19.833 --> 44:21.666
- Man, it stinks!
- It's me.

44:21.833 --> 44:23.541
Sorry. It's the sauce.

44:23.708 --> 44:26.082
The sauce went straight down.

44:26.250 --> 44:27.124
See you Saturday?

44:27.292 --> 44:28.499
Who is it?

44:28.667 --> 44:29.374
That chick?

44:29.542 --> 44:31.291
- None of your business.
- It's that chick!

44:31.458 --> 44:32.082
C'mon.

44:32.458 --> 44:34.124
To bleed her ass again?

44:34.292 --> 44:35.499
C'mon.

44:36.875 --> 44:38.707
I bet she's healed.

44:38.875 --> 44:40.582
Give her wazoo another chance.

44:40.750 --> 44:42.124
What a poet.

44:42.292 --> 44:43.582
Her little wazoo.

44:46.375 --> 44:49.749
I'm right behind you!
And I'm carrying your bag.

44:49.917 --> 44:52.332
Sorry, man.
I shouldn't have eaten that.

44:53.625 --> 44:54.582
Man,

44:55.042 --> 44:56.374
I got an idea.

44:56.542 --> 44:57.291
What is it?

44:57.458 --> 44:59.124
- A good idea.
- What're you doing?

44:59.583 --> 45:01.499
I'll wreck his doormat.

45:01.667 --> 45:04.749
- You can't be serious.
- Totally sincere!

45:04.917 --> 45:07.124
- You're totally sick!
- Hakuna Matata!

45:07.292 --> 45:09.332
Cut it out! You asshole!

45:09.500 --> 45:11.332
- Why?
- I couldn't hold it anyway.

45:11.500 --> 45:12.999
That's gross, man.

45:13.167 --> 45:14.874
Go on ahead then.

45:29.250 --> 45:30.207
Vadim?

45:30.375 --> 45:31.291
It's Emilie.

45:31.458 --> 45:33.416
- Fuck!
- How's it going?

45:34.167 --> 45:34.874
Are you okay?

45:35.833 --> 45:36.791
What're you doing?

45:36.958 --> 45:37.958
Just leaving something...

45:38.125 --> 45:39.207
Damn!

45:39.375 --> 45:41.624
Because I lost my...

45:42.125 --> 45:43.457
Lost your what?

45:44.042 --> 45:46.416
I dunno. Nothing, actually.

45:46.583 --> 45:47.624
I'll help you.

45:49.333 --> 45:51.624
I found it!

45:51.792 --> 45:52.624
It's okay.

45:53.875 --> 45:57.374
My mother says I have eagle eyes.

46:22.583 --> 46:23.999
What is it?

46:24.167 --> 46:25.041
It's me, man.

46:25.208 --> 46:28.749
My cousin in the 'hood
can set us up with a dealer.

46:28.917 --> 46:29.874
Great.

46:30.042 --> 46:31.541
But the guy, Omar,

46:31.708 --> 46:34.666
deals in semi-wholesale,
so I'm pretty sure

46:34.833 --> 46:36.749
he'll want us to buy in bulk.

46:37.000 --> 46:37.832
What's wrong?

46:38.000 --> 46:40.166
You reek all the time.

46:40.333 --> 46:42.082
It's the hash. Makes me stink.

46:42.250 --> 46:43.916
- It's awful.
- Sorry.

46:44.083 --> 46:46.499
Anyway, we gotta find customers

46:46.667 --> 46:48.082
who'll buy a lot up front.

46:48.250 --> 46:50.416
- Talk about it tomorrow?
- Why?

46:50.792 --> 46:51.791
I'm sleeping.

46:52.125 --> 46:54.041
Okay, then tomorrow.

46:57.167 --> 46:58.957
- 'Night, pal.
- 'Night.

46:59.708 --> 47:01.457
You're busting my balls!

47:01.625 --> 47:03.499
I'm just having fun.

47:06.667 --> 47:08.916
Cut it out! It's not funny.

47:12.750 --> 47:14.582
Beat it. Really.

47:16.958 --> 47:19.374
Something bothers me.

47:19.542 --> 47:20.916
What is it?

47:23.208 --> 47:26.374
If I buy a pound at once,
you won't come visit.

47:26.833 --> 47:29.874
If you don't need money,
you'll drop me like your dad.

47:30.792 --> 47:32.291
No, I won't.

47:32.458 --> 47:34.791
And he's the one who dropped me.

47:37.667 --> 47:39.457
Sorry, I'm paranoid.

47:41.042 --> 47:43.999
How're things with whatshername?

47:44.167 --> 47:45.207
Maia?

47:47.292 --> 47:50.416
Dunno.
I'm supposed to see her Saturday.

47:51.292 --> 47:54.124
But I don't think
she wants a guy who's slumming,

47:54.292 --> 47:56.541
a self-styled dealer... I don't know.

47:59.625 --> 48:00.791
Yes,

48:01.542 --> 48:03.166
but that's what you say.

48:03.792 --> 48:07.291
Maybe she'll find it exciting
to be with an outlaw.

48:08.667 --> 48:09.874
Maybe she'll like you

48:10.042 --> 48:13.124
for doing it
to keep doing what you love.

48:14.917 --> 48:17.916
I think it's fine, and admirable.

48:18.917 --> 48:19.666
Come in here

48:20.292 --> 48:22.874
before you go. I have a gift for you.

48:23.833 --> 48:25.082
A gift?

48:25.750 --> 48:26.666
Nice.

48:28.375 --> 48:30.291
That gives me the creeps.

48:30.542 --> 48:32.124
Like it?

48:32.542 --> 48:34.916
No, it's creepy. It bothers me.

48:35.083 --> 48:36.291
I think it's ugly.

48:37.250 --> 48:39.374
And Vad isn't going
to be wild either.

48:39.542 --> 48:43.332
On the contrary,
it might speak to his artistic side.

48:43.500 --> 48:45.874
It'll give him an anxiety attack.

48:46.542 --> 48:49.374
My dad's lending us the car
for tomorrow.

48:49.542 --> 48:50.166
Great.

48:50.958 --> 48:52.166
How's it going?

48:52.333 --> 48:53.666
What're you up to?

48:55.125 --> 48:56.374
Chilling out.

48:56.542 --> 49:00.457
Julia and I have planned
a surprise birthday party for Nestor.

49:02.333 --> 49:03.999
He's not gonna like that.

49:04.167 --> 49:06.666
I know his mom died in childbirth.

49:07.750 --> 49:09.249
But if he has no choice...

49:09.708 --> 49:10.791
Wobbly theory.

49:10.958 --> 49:13.082
Very wobbly, but who knows?

49:13.250 --> 49:14.874
Let's do it and we'll see.

49:15.417 --> 49:19.207
I'm showering. Some dirty bum
touched me at the market.

49:20.667 --> 49:22.874
By the way, forget it!

49:23.250 --> 49:23.874
What?

49:24.208 --> 49:25.416
That piece of shit.

49:25.583 --> 49:26.957
The painting?

49:27.750 --> 49:29.124
It goes.

49:30.083 --> 49:31.124
Shit.

49:32.708 --> 49:33.666
What intuition.

49:33.833 --> 49:36.541
Shut your trap.
Help me get rid of it.

49:39.250 --> 49:40.541
That music, seriously?

49:41.000 --> 49:41.874
What's wrong?

49:42.042 --> 49:43.332
It's Sacha Distel,

49:43.500 --> 49:44.291
a classic.

49:44.958 --> 49:46.832
And the lyrics:
"no worries, no cares."

49:47.000 --> 49:48.166
It'll be good luck.

50:04.458 --> 50:06.249
What'd you do to your hair?

50:06.958 --> 50:08.082
- Like it?
- Not at all.

50:08.250 --> 50:09.916
What's that stupid getup?

50:10.083 --> 50:11.166
It's just right.

50:11.333 --> 50:12.999
No, it's totally ambiguous:

50:13.167 --> 50:15.374
Half 90s racaille on the bottom,

50:15.542 --> 50:17.374
half mafia boss on top.

50:17.542 --> 50:19.416
I couldn't make up my mind.

50:19.583 --> 50:21.041
So I combined them.

50:21.208 --> 50:22.749
Where are you? I'm waiting.

50:22.917 --> 50:23.624
Shit.

50:25.167 --> 50:26.707
- But it works.
- No, it doesn't.

50:26.875 --> 50:27.999
Nothing to change into?

50:28.625 --> 50:30.624
- Let's go, then.
- Hang on.

50:33.708 --> 50:34.707
Oh shit!

50:45.708 --> 50:47.332
Trust me.

50:47.500 --> 50:49.832
A combat dog, we're in gangsta mode.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.916
I'm warning you: I do the talking.

50:52.083 --> 50:54.332
This isn't GTA.
We only have one life.

50:59.792 --> 51:02.999
- What're you doing?
- Gangsta code. I saw it on TV.

51:06.208 --> 51:08.416
Why whistle, asshole? C'mon.

51:08.708 --> 51:09.416
There.

51:10.208 --> 51:11.624
Now we can go.

51:13.333 --> 51:16.082
Out of the mouth of finks comes truth

51:16.250 --> 51:18.249
Kilo, what're you doing?

51:18.417 --> 51:19.207
What now?

51:19.375 --> 51:21.541
I dunno. He won't budge.

51:21.708 --> 51:23.541
- Drag him by the leash.
- I'm trying.

51:23.708 --> 51:24.582
What gives?

51:24.750 --> 51:25.999
We're coming.

51:26.167 --> 51:27.749
C'mon, Kilo!

51:29.000 --> 51:29.666
Oh, fuck!

51:42.875 --> 51:44.832
- Where's the dough?
- No idea.

51:51.542 --> 51:54.374
Your mother sucks bears

51:58.417 --> 51:59.749
I'll handle this.

52:01.833 --> 52:02.957
Shut up!

52:03.125 --> 52:04.082
Sure.

52:04.250 --> 52:05.749
Keep your trap shut.

52:06.042 --> 52:08.707
Shut the door.
We can't hear ourselves!

52:13.833 --> 52:15.207
It's very simple.

52:16.042 --> 52:19.332
I'm a calm person
and I like to stay that way.

52:20.292 --> 52:22.832
I don't enjoy that stuff.

52:23.125 --> 52:24.916
So if you don't want the same,

52:25.625 --> 52:28.124
follow instructions.

52:29.625 --> 52:31.124
The plan is simple:

52:32.042 --> 52:33.874
I give you 4 kilos of weed today.

52:34.292 --> 52:35.124
You sell it.

52:35.292 --> 52:38.916
You bring back 20,000 euros
Sunday at 8 a.m. on the dot.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.916
Thank you,
the explanation's clear as a bell.

52:45.083 --> 52:48.624
But we only need 2 kilos in fact.
That's the thing.

52:49.292 --> 52:51.874
If you want 2 kilos, fine with me.

52:52.958 --> 52:54.791
But you gotta pay up front.

52:55.125 --> 52:57.541
No credit for under 4 kilos.

52:58.792 --> 52:59.957
I get it.

53:00.583 --> 53:02.499
We gotta take 4 kilos, man.

53:04.708 --> 53:06.791
- We can't take 4 kilos.
- We have to.

53:06.958 --> 53:08.166
I'll take responsibility.

53:09.333 --> 53:12.874
So we'll go with the first option,
the 4-kilo option

53:13.833 --> 53:15.541
because we don't have any money.

53:16.083 --> 53:18.874
I love it when a plan comes together.

53:20.833 --> 53:22.957
- The A-Team.
- Shut up!

53:23.667 --> 53:24.791
Man.

53:25.250 --> 53:26.874
He jabbers.

53:27.083 --> 53:28.124
Okay, guys.

53:28.292 --> 53:31.499
Not a minute, not a second late.
Okay?

53:31.667 --> 53:32.541
Or else,

53:32.708 --> 53:33.916
you know the route.

53:34.542 --> 53:36.791
- To go to the other...
- Where they...

53:37.958 --> 53:39.916
I'm not a wimp, guys.

53:40.875 --> 53:42.791
As soon as we walked in...

53:43.667 --> 53:44.582
I agree.

53:44.750 --> 53:45.624
He's not a joker.

53:45.792 --> 53:47.791
- He's not kidding.
- Shut up!

53:51.042 --> 53:51.791
Okay,

53:53.125 --> 53:55.624
if you're sick of wimpy stuff

53:55.917 --> 53:57.916
and you wanna shift into high gear,

53:58.292 --> 53:59.624
you can do that, too.

54:01.750 --> 54:03.124
XTC.

54:03.750 --> 54:05.374
- Ecstasy.
- I know that.

54:06.583 --> 54:08.041
Sorry. So anyway,

54:08.208 --> 54:09.832
thanks for the opportunity,

54:10.000 --> 54:12.957
because not many
give young people a chance...

54:13.125 --> 54:15.707
Take your bag, your lady,
your dog and beat it.

54:15.917 --> 54:17.291
We've got a long drive.

54:17.667 --> 54:18.707
Thanks again.

54:21.875 --> 54:24.457
Don't forget: Sunday morning,

54:25.042 --> 54:26.957
8 a.m. on the dot.

54:28.250 --> 54:28.999
Oh, fuck.

54:29.167 --> 54:31.124
Your hair looks cool like that.

54:31.292 --> 54:33.249
- Think so?
- Yeah, awesome.

54:33.625 --> 54:35.332
It feels better now.

54:35.500 --> 54:37.707
Others'll feel better too.

54:37.875 --> 54:39.666
Is it ugly? You bullshitting me?

54:39.833 --> 54:40.957
It's the pits.

54:41.125 --> 54:42.416
David Luiz on 'shrooms.

54:42.583 --> 54:44.457
I kinda like it.

54:44.625 --> 54:46.416
You're making us miss the party.

54:46.583 --> 54:48.541
Can't your old lady wait?

54:48.708 --> 54:50.249
No, she can't wait.

54:50.417 --> 54:53.166
5 minutes,
and you'll be glad for the money.

54:53.333 --> 54:54.666
5 minutes, my ass. I know you.

54:54.833 --> 54:56.707
- I go up and come back down.
- Mega drag...

54:57.417 --> 54:58.374
Shut up.

54:58.917 --> 55:00.291
What's this buzzkill?

55:02.250 --> 55:03.874
The cop's coming toward us.

55:04.042 --> 55:05.499
He's coming this way.

55:06.208 --> 55:07.416
He's coming here!

55:07.583 --> 55:09.041
To tell us to turn around.

55:09.208 --> 55:10.541
- This is bad!
- Relax.

55:10.708 --> 55:12.041
We gotta get outta here.

55:12.208 --> 55:13.707
Shut the door!

55:13.875 --> 55:15.666
Cops can smell fear, like horses.

55:15.833 --> 55:16.832
The weed's in the trunk!

55:17.000 --> 55:18.582
- You're paranoid.
- Shit, the ecstasy!

55:20.708 --> 55:22.916
Hide it in your pocket.

55:23.083 --> 55:24.749
What if they search me?

55:29.833 --> 55:31.957
The street's blocked. Clear the area.

55:34.333 --> 55:35.541
You have to turn around.

55:37.917 --> 55:39.291
A problem, sir?

55:41.917 --> 55:42.999
Articulate.

55:44.375 --> 55:46.666
We're not... No problem.

55:46.833 --> 55:48.166
I'll just back up.

55:49.375 --> 55:50.916
Have a nice day.

55:52.458 --> 55:55.082
You jerk, I swallowed that thing.

55:55.833 --> 55:57.874
Wait, the concierge. Call to her.

55:58.375 --> 55:59.707
- Hey concierge!
- You nuts?

55:59.875 --> 56:01.624
I don't know her name.

56:02.917 --> 56:03.874
Yeah, try Madam.

56:04.208 --> 56:05.624
Excuse me, I'm Samuel.

56:05.792 --> 56:06.916
Hello, young man.

56:07.083 --> 56:08.374
What's going on?

56:08.542 --> 56:12.374
Madame Simone had a bad attack.
They took her to the hospital.

56:13.292 --> 56:13.957
Thanks.

56:14.125 --> 56:15.416
Sure. Goodbye.

56:18.625 --> 56:20.707
It's typical. Old folks have attacks.

56:20.875 --> 56:22.166
No, it's flipping me out.

56:22.333 --> 56:23.332
I feel awful.

56:23.500 --> 56:25.874
And you made me swallow that shit!

56:26.042 --> 56:27.124
You into her?

56:27.333 --> 56:28.416
Who, Madame Simone?

56:28.583 --> 56:32.249
Sure I'm into her. We do theater
together, we talk, we laugh.

56:32.417 --> 56:34.082
You got a thing going. She cute?

56:34.250 --> 56:36.124
Man, she's 80! Are you nuts?

56:36.292 --> 56:37.082
Relax.

56:37.250 --> 56:40.207
If she doesn't take our weed,
we're screwed.

56:40.708 --> 56:42.874
Tell that boxer guy we'll deliver.

56:43.042 --> 56:44.499
I already did. I wrote,

56:44.667 --> 56:46.457
"Dinner's ready. Steak with herbs."

56:46.625 --> 56:48.291
- Man, it...
- Whatsa matter?

56:48.458 --> 56:49.938
- Something zipped by.
- Like a flash?

56:49.958 --> 56:51.291
No, like a zipper.

56:51.458 --> 56:53.957
A fly coming at me.
The stuff's working.

56:54.125 --> 56:57.207
Relax.
They'll be too smashed to notice.

56:57.375 --> 57:00.707
I'm starting to feel it too.
Tonight we'll party.

57:00.875 --> 57:03.041
Put our troubles aside till tomorrow.

57:03.333 --> 57:04.707
C'mon, charge yourself up.

57:04.875 --> 57:06.041
You're right.

57:06.333 --> 57:07.416
You, too.

57:07.583 --> 57:08.541
3, 2, 1, surprise?

57:17.208 --> 57:18.291
Come on.

57:21.167 --> 57:22.874
Why'd we swallow that stuff?

57:25.750 --> 57:26.874
Nothing's coming out.

57:27.042 --> 57:28.363
- It's not working.
- I know, man.

57:28.375 --> 57:30.707
It was in a film:
your fingers in my mouth

57:30.875 --> 57:33.166
and your fingers in my fingers...

57:33.333 --> 57:34.957
Okay, I got it.

57:41.250 --> 57:43.541
I can't hear
with your fingers in my mouth.

57:43.708 --> 57:45.707
You gotta hit the glottis.

57:49.458 --> 57:50.749
- It won't work.
- It's gross!

57:50.917 --> 57:51.832
What're you doing?

57:53.167 --> 57:54.207
We're coming.

58:01.125 --> 58:02.499
What's with you guys?

58:05.500 --> 58:06.999
Why are you being weird?

58:07.167 --> 58:08.041
Man,

58:08.208 --> 58:11.999
we went out to the 'hood
to buy 4 kilos of weed.

58:12.667 --> 58:13.874
I let it out. Shit!

58:22.500 --> 58:24.041
Not hungry after all.
Bento

58:27.042 --> 58:29.416
- It's Bento.
- What's he say?

58:29.958 --> 58:30.958
He's not taking the weed.

58:32.208 --> 58:33.374
No one's taking it.

58:33.542 --> 58:35.082
We're fucked!

58:37.000 --> 58:39.207
We'll get the shit beat out of us.

58:45.417 --> 58:46.582
You guys!

58:47.875 --> 58:49.041
What're you on?

58:51.708 --> 58:53.832
Can we talk seriously a second?

58:55.958 --> 58:58.166
You're flipping me out.
What's up?

58:59.417 --> 59:01.916
It's in the trunk.

59:02.333 --> 59:05.041
I swear... That motha...

59:07.708 --> 59:08.874
Turn the music down!

59:18.417 --> 59:20.999
Shit! What idiots!
I don't believe it.

59:21.167 --> 59:23.499
Why not drop the place right off?

59:23.667 --> 59:24.832
I dunno, man.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.207
Dad was pissed,
I didn't want you to be.

59:27.375 --> 59:28.541
Why should we be?

59:28.708 --> 59:30.332
Because you didn't pay the rent?

59:30.500 --> 59:31.874
I didn't want you in a jam.

59:32.042 --> 59:34.791
Like we're not in a jam now!

59:35.083 --> 59:36.416
Why not say the rent was so high?

59:36.875 --> 59:38.541
Because you never asked?

59:38.708 --> 59:40.749
Cut the victim act.

59:40.917 --> 59:42.416
Relax, Vadim. This is no time.

59:42.583 --> 59:43.999
When's the time, then?

59:44.167 --> 59:45.999
We're all in deep shit now.

59:46.167 --> 59:48.291
Those dealers know where he lives.

59:48.458 --> 59:49.749
Cut the paranoia.

59:49.917 --> 59:52.332
For the moment we're not in danger.

59:52.708 --> 59:54.874
We got a week
to sell the weed and pay.

59:55.625 --> 59:56.499
Fine, great.

59:56.667 --> 01:00:00.457
How d'you sell 4 kilos
with the old lady and the boxer out?

01:00:00.625 --> 01:00:02.957
He takes us for daddy's boys.

01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:05.457
He's right. That's just what you are:

01:00:05.625 --> 01:00:07.499
rich kids who get a life by dealing.

01:00:07.833 --> 01:00:10.332
If you don't want to be helpful,
beat it.

01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:12.124
Sure I will.

01:00:12.292 --> 01:00:14.374
I'm not getting shafted
for your crap.

01:00:15.208 --> 01:00:16.082
You serious?

01:00:16.417 --> 01:00:18.207
You didn't mind my paying the rent.

01:00:18.375 --> 01:00:19.207
Yeah, right.

01:00:19.375 --> 01:00:21.832
It's true, Vad. We're a team.

01:00:24.667 --> 01:00:26.332
So what do we do now?

01:00:27.042 --> 01:00:29.291
Try to take back the weed?

01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:32.582
We're returning the dope
because we don't need it.

01:00:34.583 --> 01:00:36.541
We're outta here.
Leave him alone.

01:00:39.208 --> 01:00:40.332
Well?

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.874
Negative. No go.

01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:43.874
- The keys, Tim.
- What'd he say?

01:00:44.042 --> 01:00:47.249
- I got the keys?
- Not much. He just bitchslapped us.

01:00:47.417 --> 01:00:48.332
My nose is bleeding.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.832
- Who has the keys?
- That all?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.332
No, and that he'd make us
eat each other's balls.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.332
A 69, can you imagine?

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.499
Meaning?

01:00:57.708 --> 01:01:01.999
I guess he'd put us
head to tail at the nuts.

01:01:02.167 --> 01:01:05.291
You have the keys!
Shut up with your 69!

01:01:06.042 --> 01:01:07.874
So we're shit out of luck.

01:01:08.333 --> 01:01:09.874
We gotta sell the weed.

01:01:10.042 --> 01:01:11.457
But to who?

01:01:11.917 --> 01:01:13.332
We know no dealers.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.207
Why not sell it ourselves?
In half-zips.

01:01:16.375 --> 01:01:17.124
In what?

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.332
Half-zips. Don't know that?

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.291
- No, explain.
- It's simple.

01:01:22.917 --> 01:01:25.541
We've got 4 kilos of pot.

01:01:25.708 --> 01:01:29.082
That's about 4000 grams.
In fact, it's...

01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:30.874
It's 4000.

01:01:31.042 --> 01:01:33.249
Totally. If my math is right.

01:01:33.417 --> 01:01:36.957
We divide it into half-ounces.

01:01:37.125 --> 01:01:39.041
Into half-zips.

01:01:39.375 --> 01:01:41.166
We cut it.

01:01:41.333 --> 01:01:43.249
Actually, no. Cutting

01:01:43.417 --> 01:01:46.791
is for hash,
but the stems make it harder.

01:01:46.958 --> 01:01:49.832
But with a little scale we could...

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.541
Hang on, we don't follow.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:52.666
Show us.

01:01:56.542 --> 01:01:57.291
Maybe, yeah.

01:01:57.458 --> 01:01:58.124
You coming?

01:01:58.292 --> 01:02:01.332
Maybe it's easier if I show you...

01:02:46.875 --> 01:02:48.541
Why do we dress like this?

01:02:48.917 --> 01:02:51.999
Ever see a cop stop a guy
wearing tassel loafers?

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:34.832
Tim's dick hanging out - legendary!

01:03:41.792 --> 01:03:43.916
Hey! How's it going on your end?

01:03:44.333 --> 01:03:46.832
Not fantastic.
We've managed to pick up...

01:03:47.167 --> 01:03:49.832
about 800, 900 at most.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.832
It's a very weird party.
Julia vanished and I'm stressing out.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.249
How much you got?

01:03:55.417 --> 01:03:57.541
I'll count it and tell you.

01:03:57.833 --> 01:04:00.457
I'm going to look for Julia.

01:04:02.083 --> 01:04:03.791
Very weird scene here.

01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:08.457
Hey, take it easy.

01:04:17.167 --> 01:04:19.374
I found Julia, man.

01:04:23.417 --> 01:04:24.707
And Vadim.

01:04:28.208 --> 01:04:30.707
Man, she's making it with Vadim.

01:04:31.875 --> 01:04:33.957
Fuck, man! Vadim showed up

01:04:34.125 --> 01:04:36.624
and they're frenching like crazy.

01:04:37.292 --> 01:04:38.457
You hear me?

01:04:42.208 --> 01:04:44.791
Why hang up?
I gotta tell 'em how much.

01:04:44.958 --> 01:04:46.082
We got cut off.

01:04:46.833 --> 01:04:47.832
Here.

01:04:55.167 --> 01:04:57.791
What's this?
Are you guys together or what?

01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:59.499
Sort of.

01:04:59.667 --> 01:05:01.499
Yeah, sort of! Since when?

01:05:01.667 --> 01:05:02.666
I dunno. Who cares?

01:05:02.833 --> 01:05:05.374
I care! How can you be so cagey?

01:05:05.542 --> 01:05:07.999
Relax.
And if you could keep it quiet...

01:05:08.875 --> 01:05:12.166
If you want. You're lucky,
I was just telling Nestor,

01:05:12.333 --> 01:05:13.582
and we got cut off.

01:05:14.167 --> 01:05:16.291
You cagey bastards!

01:05:16.458 --> 01:05:17.832
Let's get outta here.

01:05:18.333 --> 01:05:20.874
Like Chandler and Monica!

01:05:21.458 --> 01:05:22.541
How cagey!

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:26.499
Not enough.
I hoped we'd sell more.

01:05:26.792 --> 01:05:27.832
Vadim?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.166
Come look.

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:31.457
- What is it?
- Look at this.

01:05:31.917 --> 01:05:33.499
See what I was saying?

01:05:33.667 --> 01:05:36.832
She's so radiant, that bitch!

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.374
Look at this. I can't stand it.

01:05:40.208 --> 01:05:42.957
You wanna squeeze the milk
out of those tits.

01:05:43.125 --> 01:05:45.832
I'd make some lady cheese out of it!

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.291
What a pig!

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.582
- Julia is family!
- I know.

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:52.249
But she could get me hot.
Look at this.

01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:56.707
You're such a pig.

01:05:57.458 --> 01:05:58.832
What's the problem?

01:05:59.875 --> 01:06:01.291
I'm going to bed.

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:11.332
It's Maia. At least answer.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.957
I waited like a fool.
You'd better have an excuse.

01:06:20.333 --> 01:06:22.874
Ali, it's Sam.
Remember, some customers

01:06:23.083 --> 01:06:25.791
wanted me personally
to look after their car?

01:06:26.083 --> 01:06:29.124
Text me or call
if one of them shows up.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.124
Hang on. One was looking for you.

01:06:32.542 --> 01:06:35.916
You know, that tightwad actress.
Whatsherface?

01:06:36.208 --> 01:06:37.082
Yeah, totally.

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:38.582
She left her number.

01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:40.499
Send it to me then. Great.

01:06:42.917 --> 01:06:44.749
Barnaby is an old friend.

01:06:44.917 --> 01:06:47.666
He's got a weird personality,

01:06:47.833 --> 01:06:49.457
but he's a good guy.

01:06:49.625 --> 01:06:50.457
Okay.

01:06:53.875 --> 01:06:54.749
Check this out.

01:06:54.917 --> 01:06:56.041
Sorry...

01:06:56.208 --> 01:06:57.874
Framed panties!

01:06:58.583 --> 01:07:01.499
Vera, Prague, 1993.

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:04.499
Svetlana, St Petersburg, 1988.

01:07:04.667 --> 01:07:07.541
I wasn't even born
when he was doin' tons of chicks.

01:07:07.708 --> 01:07:08.624
Doin', doin'...

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:12.332
Hey, a Y-front.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.457
Lisbon, 2007. Pedro.

01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:16.874
That's a quality. The guy's open.

01:07:17.042 --> 01:07:18.457
Yes, a quality.

01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:21.332
Sorry, gentlemen, I kept you...

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.582
Sit down, don't move,

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:24.957
take it easy.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.874
First, thanks for coming, guys.

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:30.291
Thank you.

01:07:31.667 --> 01:07:34.207
No, thank you for coming.

01:07:34.375 --> 01:07:35.749
Here's the score:

01:07:35.917 --> 01:07:37.416
I'm throwing a big party

01:07:37.583 --> 01:07:39.457
for my only daughter's 20th.

01:07:39.625 --> 01:07:41.666
Sophie's one of a kind.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.499
I know from experience
what harm drugs can do.

01:07:48.833 --> 01:07:51.916
So for that, I got to thinking,
and here's the concept:

01:07:52.083 --> 01:07:54.999
I told her:
"Okay for a party, but I do the pot

01:07:55.167 --> 01:07:58.666
"for you and your little pals
on one condition:

01:07:58.833 --> 01:08:00.082
"You touch nothing else."

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.791
You can trust them.

01:08:01.958 --> 01:08:04.666
Their weed is top grade.

01:08:04.833 --> 01:08:07.416
I approve that dope 100 percent.

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:09.582
Well then, Fanny dear,

01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:12.291
if you trust, I trust,
we all trust them.

01:08:12.458 --> 01:08:14.916
We have trust. A virtuous circle.

01:08:15.083 --> 01:08:16.041
Dunno why,

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:18.707
but I like your little
fucktard dealers.

01:08:19.207 --> 01:08:20.874
"Fucktard" is a bit...

01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:23.499
Instinct, man.

01:08:25.082 --> 01:08:26.041
So, let's recap:

01:08:26.207 --> 01:08:28.416
I gather there's about 150 guests...

01:08:28.582 --> 01:08:29.791
Let me interrupt.

01:08:31.917 --> 01:08:32.832
It's crap!

01:08:33.167 --> 01:08:34.916
Bummer, it itches.

01:08:35.332 --> 01:08:36.874
Sorry, I interrupted.

01:08:37.042 --> 01:08:39.082
- No, I was talking.
- I interrupted you?

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:40.707
Sorry, I didn't interrupt.

01:08:41.457 --> 01:08:42.832
So, about 150 people,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.416
1 kilo to be safe, in that range.

01:08:45.875 --> 01:08:49.582
Why don't we have
a weed catering service?

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:52.957
You'd be here
rolling blunts for the guests.

01:08:54.375 --> 01:08:57.082
I picture you in waiter's livery.
Totally chic.

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:00.874
Totally chic.

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:05.749
- What's so funny?
- I dunno.

01:09:07.292 --> 01:09:09.707
Hey, Fanny, you ought to settle down.

01:09:09.875 --> 01:09:12.291
You're pretty stoned.

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:14.291
Not at all.

01:09:14.457 --> 01:09:15.499
Fine idea.

01:09:15.667 --> 01:09:19.374
If I could piggyback on that,
Tim's an excellent cook,

01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:21.832
so for an additional fee

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.082
he could do
a sort of Maryjane buffet.

01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:26.582
Like space food.

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:28.124
Space food!

01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:29.624
Americano!

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:32.332
Hold it.

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.041
And we figured...

01:09:34.207 --> 01:09:35.082
Sorry.

01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:36.874
- The phone.
- Sure.

01:09:37.042 --> 01:09:38.082
I'm listening.

01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:39.582
Put the guy on.

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:41.707
I told you he was a bit...

01:09:41.875 --> 01:09:42.957
weird.

01:09:43.292 --> 01:09:45.582
Yeah... weird.

01:09:46.417 --> 01:09:47.666
Ls that how it is?

01:09:47.832 --> 01:09:49.707
I'll mash you to a pulp.

01:09:53.707 --> 01:09:54.791
You okay, Barn?

01:09:54.958 --> 01:09:57.082
No, Barn's not okay.

01:09:57.792 --> 01:10:00.041
That DJ clown just cancelled

01:10:00.208 --> 01:10:02.041
a week before the party.

01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:05.374
It's a disaster!
Fucking Pinocchio boy!

01:10:05.542 --> 01:10:09.541
Allow me to interrupt.
You mentioned DJ, Pinocchio...

01:10:09.708 --> 01:10:11.124
We have a friend

01:10:11.292 --> 01:10:15.124
who's very cute, she mixes great
and I know she's free.

01:10:15.833 --> 01:10:18.499
The guy hesitates, then...

01:10:18.667 --> 01:10:19.582
Bingo!

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:22.374
Sure he didn't say "banco"?

01:10:22.708 --> 01:10:25.124
Banco? Bingo? I don't remember.

01:10:26.083 --> 01:10:27.249
So how much we got?

01:10:27.417 --> 01:10:28.874
I didn't finish.

01:10:29.042 --> 01:10:30.166
He said "bingo."

01:10:30.333 --> 01:10:32.041
The jerk got it wrong.

01:10:32.208 --> 01:10:33.291
Please! Who cares?

01:10:33.458 --> 01:10:35.666
So I sold him a video, too,

01:10:35.833 --> 01:10:37.374
that you'll shoot, Vad,

01:10:37.542 --> 01:10:39.957
and suckered him
into the whole package

01:10:40.125 --> 01:10:41.916
for 17,000, and he said yes.

01:10:42.083 --> 01:10:45.749
Which means with what
we sold already, we can pay Omar.

01:10:46.958 --> 01:10:47.999
Incredible!

01:11:21.292 --> 01:11:23.291
I've come to see Madame Simone.

01:11:23.458 --> 01:11:25.249
Are you family?

01:11:26.333 --> 01:11:27.749
Not really.

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:29.082
I'm sorry,

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:32.332
only family members
are allowed to visit.

01:11:32.792 --> 01:11:33.541
Alright.

01:11:33.708 --> 01:11:36.666
Could I leave my number in case...

01:11:36.833 --> 01:11:38.624
- No problem.
- Thanks.

01:11:45.125 --> 01:11:46.332
Here.

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.874
Wait, sorry.

01:11:50.375 --> 01:11:52.249
Could you give her this?

01:11:52.417 --> 01:11:54.416
It's a doll, but she's fond of it.

01:11:54.583 --> 01:11:55.499
Alright.

01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:57.874
Have a nice day.

01:12:06.292 --> 01:12:07.832
Maia, wait, please.

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:11.082
I fucked up. Let me explain.

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:12.499
I'm listening.

01:12:13.708 --> 01:12:15.041
Right here, now?

01:12:15.375 --> 01:12:16.541
So I figured.

01:12:16.708 --> 01:12:17.374
Please!

01:12:19.792 --> 01:12:21.582
If I didn't call,

01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:24.249
it's because I'm also an intern.

01:12:24.417 --> 01:12:27.041
I work nights in a hospital

01:12:27.708 --> 01:12:28.832
for...

01:12:32.792 --> 01:12:33.874
Shit!

01:12:36.667 --> 01:12:38.082
I'll say what comes to mind:

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:40.166
I've been flying since I was a kid,

01:12:40.333 --> 01:12:42.749
The air force gave me
a secret mission.

01:12:42.917 --> 01:12:47.416
I was abroad. No signal, no 3G.
Sometimes some crappy Edge.

01:12:47.625 --> 01:12:50.582
Even better.
I'm shy. Pathologically shy.

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:53.207
A headbanger
who can't even punch a number.

01:12:53.375 --> 01:12:54.582
I go nuts.

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:55.957
You know what?

01:12:56.792 --> 01:12:59.041
That's not even fucking true.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:03.832
I've got this instinct
that makes me say stuff like that.

01:13:04.167 --> 01:13:06.791
But it's not true, that's all.

01:13:07.292 --> 01:13:09.749
Today I'll tell the truth.

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:11.082
The truth is

01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:13.916
I owe 20,000 euros
to a hothead dealer,

01:13:14.083 --> 01:13:16.832
a wacko billionaire
is buying back my debt,

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.541
and I didn't want to involve you.

01:13:22.208 --> 01:13:23.749
But I was thinking about you.

01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:26.166
Really.

01:13:28.125 --> 01:13:30.041
And that's the truth.

01:13:35.333 --> 01:13:37.416
You really take me for a fool.

01:13:38.167 --> 01:13:40.374
If you're not into me, that's fine.

01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:44.332
But don't give me nonsense like that.

01:13:45.583 --> 01:13:47.332
You're pathetic.

01:13:53.083 --> 01:13:54.582
It's true, dammit.

01:13:55.875 --> 01:13:57.207
It's true.

01:14:09.333 --> 01:14:11.499
Why'd you run off that evening?

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:13.707
What?

01:14:13.875 --> 01:14:16.416
- You'd lost something.
- Totally, yeah.

01:14:16.583 --> 01:14:19.999
I remember. I'd lost my bracelet.

01:14:20.167 --> 01:14:21.374
I figured, if you...

01:14:22.417 --> 01:14:23.416
A dump.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.582
I took a dump
on Mr. Limoges' doormat,

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:28.332
and I was holding my turd.
It'd look odd.

01:14:29.375 --> 01:14:30.666
Oh, I see.

01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:32.666
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:14:32.833 --> 01:14:36.499
I was afraid you thought
I was the one who farted.

01:14:36.667 --> 01:14:37.624
You must be kidding.

01:14:37.792 --> 01:14:39.082
I'm the one who farted.

01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:41.749
It was you. Good.

01:14:41.917 --> 01:14:44.332
I'll get back to work.

01:14:46.167 --> 01:14:47.166
So long.

01:14:57.917 --> 01:15:00.832
You scared me!
I thought it was the neighbor.

01:15:01.167 --> 01:15:02.666
What're you doing?

01:15:02.833 --> 01:15:04.749
Switching names with Limoges.

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:07.582
Why? He'll get our mail
and we'll get his.

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:09.457
It's to steal his mail.

01:15:09.625 --> 01:15:11.666
But we won't get ours.

01:15:11.958 --> 01:15:14.374
I'm too tired. Do what you want.

01:15:15.958 --> 01:15:19.457
But don't wake me at 5 a.m.
The party's tomorrow.

01:15:19.625 --> 01:15:21.082
Okay, don't worry.

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:44.957
- Everything going well?
- Hey, man.

01:15:45.125 --> 01:15:46.207
Canapé!

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.707
It's in the shape of a canapé.

01:15:48.875 --> 01:15:50.207
I got it, Tim.

01:15:50.375 --> 01:15:51.416
Gentlemen.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.749
It's the right time
to introduce the one all this is for.

01:15:55.917 --> 01:15:57.582
This is my daughter, Sophie.

01:15:59.125 --> 01:16:00.499
Pleased to meet you.

01:16:00.667 --> 01:16:01.541
My pleasure.

01:16:01.708 --> 01:16:02.957
And happy birthday.

01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:06.832
This is my jewel, my star.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.332
Isn't she gorgeous?

01:16:10.458 --> 01:16:13.332
She's what matters most to me
since her mother...

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.832
Excuse me, man, stop

01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:18.041
when I'm talking.

01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:22.791
Thanks. Since her mother left me
on a misunderstanding.

01:16:24.583 --> 01:16:26.291
Be very careful

01:16:26.458 --> 01:16:28.624
to avoid misunderstandings, guys.

01:16:29.708 --> 01:16:30.874
Thanks for the advice.

01:16:31.042 --> 01:16:31.957
Good advice.

01:16:33.167 --> 01:16:34.249
There.

01:16:36.167 --> 01:16:37.082
I'm going back out.

01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:39.457
Me too. Guests are arriving.

01:16:39.625 --> 01:16:40.332
Naturally.

01:16:45.792 --> 01:16:46.707
How's it going?

01:16:46.875 --> 01:16:48.166
- Okay, and you?
- Fine.

01:16:48.333 --> 01:16:50.207
Those two are already smashed.

01:17:22.083 --> 01:17:23.791
- Good job!
- Not bad, huh?

01:17:24.083 --> 01:17:26.624
My croquembouche
with pot cream stuffed pastries.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:27.874
Wild!

01:17:28.042 --> 01:17:29.291
Hold on.

01:17:29.458 --> 01:17:31.291
I'll stuff my daughter's last puff.

01:17:31.458 --> 01:17:32.332
Sure.

01:17:32.708 --> 01:17:34.541
I like the symbolism.

01:17:35.792 --> 01:17:38.666
Squeeze the pastry bag,
but not too hard...

01:17:39.042 --> 01:17:40.249
Shit!

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.082
Put hot water on it.

01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:45.666
Scrub hard. Sorry, you can't...

01:17:45.833 --> 01:17:46.582
Fuck!

01:17:47.375 --> 01:17:48.957
The guy's wacko.

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:53.124
Why won't you tell the others?

01:17:53.292 --> 01:17:54.416
You're such a pain.

01:17:54.583 --> 01:17:57.082
I don't get it.
Only Nestor and Tim don't know.

01:17:57.250 --> 01:17:58.832
Stop! I can't take any more.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.499
What's with you?
It's over, is that it?

01:18:01.667 --> 01:18:02.499
Leave me alone!

01:18:02.667 --> 01:18:04.249
Okay, have a nice evening.

01:18:04.417 --> 01:18:05.707
Ballbuster!

01:18:09.792 --> 01:18:12.207
His damn cream won't come out.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.999
Look at this! Brand new...

01:19:07.208 --> 01:19:08.791
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

01:19:09.542 --> 01:19:11.249
No, fella.

01:19:11.417 --> 01:19:13.416
None of that between us.

01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:15.416
This is the house of joy.

01:19:15.833 --> 01:19:18.874
I want my guests to feel comfortable.
Go on,

01:19:19.208 --> 01:19:20.374
enjoy yourself.

01:19:20.542 --> 01:19:21.832
Take it slow,

01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:23.291
that's good,

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:25.541
like that, right.

01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:28.166
Tell her stuff.

01:19:29.833 --> 01:19:31.999
Say things to her, I tell ya.

01:19:34.833 --> 01:19:36.749
Go on, say stuff to her.

01:19:37.167 --> 01:19:38.499
How's it going?

01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:41.041
You idiot, not "how's it going?"

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:42.874
Tell her wild stuff.

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:46.666
Like "I love licking
your fleshy little tit."

01:19:47.417 --> 01:19:48.541
Go on!

01:19:49.875 --> 01:19:52.207
I love licking your fuzzy little tit.

01:19:53.542 --> 01:19:56.249
Skip it, you lack the vocabulary.

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:58.916
Pull her hair back, like that.

01:19:59.292 --> 01:20:00.749
Go on.

01:20:00.917 --> 01:20:02.332
I love it, go on.

01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:06.374
It's me, Daddy,

01:20:07.917 --> 01:20:08.666
Sorry.

01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:14.666
Think you can kiss a chick
and I don't care?

01:20:14.833 --> 01:20:15.874
I thought we broke up.

01:20:16.042 --> 01:20:17.403
- I didn't say that!
- Yes you did.

01:20:17.458 --> 01:20:19.541
- You did.
- You don't get it!

01:20:19.708 --> 01:20:22.082
I just wanted time to...

01:20:22.833 --> 01:20:23.791
Not rush into it.

01:20:23.958 --> 01:20:26.332
Rush into what? It's been a year.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:27.707
What d'you want me to say?

01:20:27.875 --> 01:20:31.749
That I'm pregnant and
want to keep it because I love you?

01:20:31.917 --> 01:20:33.582
I dunno. Why say that?

01:20:35.333 --> 01:20:36.666
There, I told you.

01:20:37.375 --> 01:20:38.166
What?

01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:41.207
That I'm pregnant.

01:20:45.833 --> 01:20:46.957
I love you, Vad.

01:20:47.125 --> 01:20:47.957
Where is he?

01:20:48.125 --> 01:20:49.666
Where's that scumbag?

01:20:52.125 --> 01:20:55.207
The bastard
who fucks my daughter under my roof!

01:20:56.042 --> 01:20:57.582
The little bitch.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.041
That asshole!

01:21:00.583 --> 01:21:02.041
You thought I was easy?

01:21:02.208 --> 01:21:03.916
You'll see how easy I am!

01:21:04.083 --> 01:21:05.416
Get your ass back here.

01:21:06.167 --> 01:21:08.957
You sonofabitch, when I find you

01:21:09.125 --> 01:21:10.291
I'll pulverize you!

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:14.082
Deal of the day:
I'll blow you a new asshole!

01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:15.791
Man, I'm primed!

01:21:15.958 --> 01:21:18.957
Little bastard! You gave me a boost!

01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:20.541
Hang on, I think it's him.

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:23.166
It's him. Move it! C'mon!

01:21:26.958 --> 01:21:28.999
I didn't know she was his daughter.

01:21:29.167 --> 01:21:30.541
Not now, man.

01:21:41.417 --> 01:21:43.749
- Where's Julia?
- At her mom's. She's tired.

01:21:44.042 --> 01:21:47.041
I thought
she went to suck some guy off.

01:21:47.417 --> 01:21:48.416
Shut up, now!

01:21:48.583 --> 01:21:49.582
What's the deal?

01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:50.916
Shut up, I said.

01:21:51.083 --> 01:21:52.916
Talk about Julia and I'll sock you.

01:21:53.083 --> 01:21:53.999
Hiding something?

01:21:54.167 --> 01:21:56.041
Yeah, go get fucked!

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.041
Why not say you were together?

01:21:59.208 --> 01:22:01.082
When I talked to you about her?

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:02.957
Hang on, who's together?

01:22:04.042 --> 01:22:04.791
What is this?

01:22:04.958 --> 01:22:06.457
Julia and me are an item.

01:22:06.625 --> 01:22:08.832
- Okay? Can we move on?
- Let go of me!

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.249
Asshole.

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.124
But he's right.

01:22:13.792 --> 01:22:15.624
We really are in deep shit.

01:22:16.292 --> 01:22:17.457
Are you serious?

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.916
And who's fault is it?

01:22:20.083 --> 01:22:22.874
Once again you thought
with your dick.

01:22:23.042 --> 01:22:25.207
Don't pull your level-headed
niggah act.

01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:27.499
Cut it out. Something's more urgent.

01:22:27.667 --> 01:22:29.082
We have no dope, no money,

01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:30.749
and 24 hours to find a solution.

01:22:30.917 --> 01:22:32.499
You're raving mad!

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.291
You put us in the shit
and then tell us to calm down.

01:22:37.458 --> 01:22:41.041
And cut the "we."
It's your problem to start with.

01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:51.874
So what do we do, guys?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.624
Are you serious?

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:01.374
Okay.

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:03.916
So that's how it is?

01:23:05.167 --> 01:23:08.499
That's just great.
A fine family we've become!

01:23:08.833 --> 01:23:10.374
Thanks. You know what, Tim?

01:23:10.542 --> 01:23:13.249
Omar dealt with you and me,
so you're fucked, too.

01:23:13.417 --> 01:23:16.332
Even more,
because it was your contact.

01:23:18.625 --> 01:23:20.916
If it's everyone for himself, fine.

01:23:21.083 --> 01:23:22.457
I'm outta here.

01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:25.666
You can all go get fucked!

01:23:31.625 --> 01:23:32.416
Sam's right.

01:23:32.583 --> 01:23:34.749
I'm the one who found Omar.

01:23:35.042 --> 01:23:36.291
- I'm a dead man.
- Stop, Tim.

01:23:36.458 --> 01:23:37.124
I'm dead.

01:23:37.292 --> 01:23:39.624
So we wait for Omar's thugs?
What's the plan?

01:23:41.167 --> 01:23:42.499
I might have an idea.

01:23:44.583 --> 01:23:47.374
A good run
in the Longchamp Abbey Cup...

01:23:47.542 --> 01:23:51.332
...is set for an excellent run
in the Brocher Cup.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.041
Gregory Benoit
is riding Spirit Quartz

01:23:54.208 --> 01:23:57.207
once again heading to Ascot.

01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:00.207
I'd like to put

01:24:00.542 --> 01:24:03.624
2,390 euros on Ruby of the Islands.

01:24:04.542 --> 01:24:06.832
- Odds are nine to one, right?
- That's right.

01:24:14.042 --> 01:24:16.749
We'd like to speak
with Captain Latour.

01:24:16.917 --> 01:24:18.166
Regarding?

01:24:18.917 --> 01:24:20.082
Drug dealing.

01:24:20.542 --> 01:24:21.916
One moment.

01:24:38.833 --> 01:24:40.082
That's...

01:24:41.708 --> 01:24:42.749
Goddammit!

01:24:43.125 --> 01:24:45.082
What a moron!

01:24:46.625 --> 01:24:50.916
You can yak away about bumfucking
Julia and be totally focused,

01:24:51.083 --> 01:24:55.041
but too spaced out to check your
pockets before going to the police.

01:24:56.417 --> 01:24:58.791
Almost neck and neck.
Off to a good start

01:24:58.958 --> 01:25:01.082
is Number 10 coming up with

01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:03.207
Roboba from the inside.

01:25:03.667 --> 01:25:04.707
Yeah, good going!

01:25:04.958 --> 01:25:06.207
Number 3 is making progress

01:25:06.375 --> 01:25:08.207
alongside Grand Galil...

01:25:08.375 --> 01:25:09.624
Yes! Not bad.

01:25:10.833 --> 01:25:12.749
Go, go! Lengthen it!

01:25:20.708 --> 01:25:22.166
Fuck, no!

01:25:22.333 --> 01:25:23.916
Goddammit to hell!

01:25:24.083 --> 01:25:25.041
Oh, shit!

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.332
Samuel, it's Maia.

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.249
I've got bad news.

01:25:42.417 --> 01:25:43.749
It's Madame Simone...

01:25:44.542 --> 01:25:47.499
Thank you all for coming

01:25:47.667 --> 01:25:49.791
for the burial
of our dear Madame Simone,

01:25:49.958 --> 01:25:51.749
who was an exceptional woman.

01:25:52.083 --> 01:25:54.166
And tomorrow,

01:25:55.583 --> 01:25:57.416
prayers will be held

01:25:57.583 --> 01:25:59.999
for her soul at 7:30 p.m.

01:26:00.167 --> 01:26:01.374
Thank you again.

01:26:05.083 --> 01:26:06.457
I'm sorry.

01:26:06.625 --> 01:26:07.999
I'm sorry, too.

01:26:08.583 --> 01:26:11.957
Madame Simone told me.
Sorry I didn't believe you.

01:26:13.458 --> 01:26:15.207
But you were right:

01:26:15.375 --> 01:26:18.416
I can't see myself involved
with a dealer.

01:26:22.375 --> 01:26:23.916
What I realize

01:26:25.167 --> 01:26:27.874
is that I managed
to wreck everything so fast.

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:30.291
It must be a world record.

01:26:31.667 --> 01:26:35.499
Everyone thinks I'm a rotten liar
who can't be trusted.

01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:38.957
A pretty perfect track record.

01:26:44.708 --> 01:26:47.249
She said, "If he comes
to the funeral, give it to him.

01:26:47.917 --> 01:26:49.499
"If he doesn't, throw it out

01:26:49.667 --> 01:26:50.999
"and forget about him."

01:26:51.458 --> 01:26:53.749
I don't think she ever doubted
you'd be here.

01:26:57.917 --> 01:26:59.082
I'll be going.

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:23.541
As misfortune falls,
twilight comes into view.

01:27:23.708 --> 01:27:27.666
The breeze blows it away,
and hope is renewed.

01:27:43.458 --> 01:27:44.332
Come in.

01:27:45.667 --> 01:27:48.291
Chief,
I have a young lawyer in custody

01:27:48.583 --> 01:27:50.124
who insists on seeing you.

01:27:50.292 --> 01:27:53.582
Says it's real important,
has friends in high places, etc.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.374
Bring him in.

01:27:56.542 --> 01:27:58.082
Not too pissed about Vadim and Julia?

01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:02.957
No, but...

01:28:03.167 --> 01:28:06.707
I had a thing for Julia
but I knew we'd never hook up.

01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:09.874
They're family.
If they're happy, I am too.

01:28:10.542 --> 01:28:13.332
It just pisses me off
that he didn't tell me.

01:28:15.250 --> 01:28:16.374
True.

01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:18.707
And with the concierge's daughter?

01:28:21.125 --> 01:28:22.291
I dunno.

01:28:22.917 --> 01:28:24.249
Not great.

01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:27.249
You could have anyone
if you did it right.

01:28:27.417 --> 01:28:29.874
I'm not as cool as you.
I can't do it.

01:28:30.042 --> 01:28:31.916
I'm not cool, man. It's not...

01:28:32.083 --> 01:28:33.291
Sure you are.

01:28:33.458 --> 01:28:36.291
Think a cool guy does a new one
every night?

01:28:37.667 --> 01:28:41.957
No, it's a guy who's unhappy,
who can't find what he's after.

01:28:42.125 --> 01:28:42.874
What?

01:28:43.417 --> 01:28:45.332
What're you talking about?

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.124
You got a complex?

01:28:47.667 --> 01:28:48.666
That complex...

01:28:48.833 --> 01:28:51.207
The pervert who wanted
to do his old lady?

01:28:52.542 --> 01:28:54.624
Oedipus! The Oedipus complex.

01:28:55.667 --> 01:28:57.457
- Is that it?
- Pretty much.

01:28:58.042 --> 01:28:59.582
That pussy complex.

01:29:03.042 --> 01:29:04.291
Come with me.

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.791
You're here! I'm so glad.
And the others?

01:29:12.958 --> 01:29:14.374
Can't reach 'em.

01:29:14.542 --> 01:29:16.166
- Come here.
- What's up?

01:29:16.333 --> 01:29:18.166
Madame Simone, from my acting class.

01:29:18.375 --> 01:29:20.374
She gave me this painting

01:29:20.542 --> 01:29:24.999
and left me a poem about watercolor,
twilight and renewal.

01:29:25.167 --> 01:29:28.374
I have a feeling
there's a message, a metaphor.

01:29:28.542 --> 01:29:30.666
Like a treasure hunt.

01:29:30.875 --> 01:29:32.541
Maybe it's just her last joke.

01:29:32.708 --> 01:29:33.749
She capable of it.

01:29:34.208 --> 01:29:35.374
What're you doing?

01:29:37.625 --> 01:29:40.541
Holy shit! It wasn't a joke.

01:29:46.375 --> 01:29:49.041
Shit! How much is there?

01:29:49.208 --> 01:29:49.916
All 500s.

01:29:50.083 --> 01:29:52.082
There're all 500s.

01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:53.666
We've got it!

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.541
What'd he say?

01:29:59.167 --> 01:30:00.249
He's calling the precinct.

01:30:00.625 --> 01:30:02.541
He's keeping us tonight,

01:30:02.708 --> 01:30:04.416
but if they nab Omar,
we're out tomorrow.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.332
Ls that good news?

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.874
Yeah, it's good news.

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.624
- Nice going.
- So it's cool.

01:30:13.792 --> 01:30:15.832
They're still on voice-mail.

01:30:16.833 --> 01:30:19.207
Tim, it's Sam.
Why don't you answer?

01:30:19.375 --> 01:30:21.541
I came up with the money.

01:30:21.708 --> 01:30:24.249
I'll take it to Omar tomorrow at 8.

01:30:24.417 --> 01:30:26.957
So call me back.

01:30:27.958 --> 01:30:29.291
Cheers.

01:30:30.125 --> 01:30:31.541
To Madame Simone.

01:30:32.125 --> 01:30:34.332
Excellent toast. To Madame Simone.

01:30:39.167 --> 01:30:40.332
Not drinking?

01:30:40.750 --> 01:30:42.457
I can't any more.

01:30:42.625 --> 01:30:43.291
Why not?

01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:49.166
Julia's pregnant.

01:30:54.333 --> 01:30:55.957
Pregnant by you?

01:30:58.333 --> 01:30:59.916
You're gonna be a daddy?

01:31:00.833 --> 01:31:02.291
I guess so.

01:31:03.542 --> 01:31:04.624
Gonna name him Tim?

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:05.707
I don't think so.

01:31:05.875 --> 01:31:07.124
I understand.

01:31:09.042 --> 01:31:10.041
Man!

01:31:10.833 --> 01:31:12.707
That's incredible!

01:31:14.542 --> 01:31:15.499
Man, that's...

01:31:15.667 --> 01:31:17.666
My chum's pregnant, guys!

01:31:17.833 --> 01:31:19.124
I'm gonna be an uncle.

01:31:19.292 --> 01:31:20.374
He'll be called Samuel!

01:31:20.542 --> 01:31:21.791
I'm not sure about that.

01:31:21.958 --> 01:31:23.166
The name's not sure.

01:31:23.333 --> 01:31:24.374
This is unbelievable!

01:31:24.542 --> 01:31:28.541
I'll drink to little Samuel's health.
You never know.

01:31:31.042 --> 01:31:32.207
It's so cool.

01:31:33.875 --> 01:31:35.082
You're gonna be an uncle.

01:31:35.458 --> 01:31:36.957
I'm gonna be an uncle, man.

01:31:38.542 --> 01:31:39.332
You crying?

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:40.791
No, I'm not crying.

01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:46.041
Yes you are.

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:50.291
It's just that I'm moved.

01:31:51.958 --> 01:31:53.791
Any ideas for a godfather?

01:31:54.333 --> 01:31:55.707
How about him?

01:32:14.583 --> 01:32:15.332
Yes, Chief?

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:18.541
We've taken a certain Omar Khedi
into custody.

01:32:18.708 --> 01:32:21.207
He was holding several kilos
of cannabis, cocaine

01:32:21.375 --> 01:32:22.499
and other narcotics.

01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:25.749
I've got tons of messages.

01:32:26.583 --> 01:32:27.791
My battery's dead.

01:32:28.625 --> 01:32:31.957
We also arrested a young customer
who'd come to pay.

01:32:32.125 --> 01:32:34.374
It's Sam. Why aren't you answering?

01:32:34.542 --> 01:32:37.916
I got the money.
I'm taking it to Omar at 8 a.m.

01:32:38.083 --> 01:32:39.291
What's going on?

01:32:39.583 --> 01:32:41.582
So call me back.

01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:43.541
Sam went to meet Omar.

01:32:57.833 --> 01:32:58.707
Voicemail.

01:33:15.375 --> 01:33:16.207
Oh fuck!

01:33:16.375 --> 01:33:17.624
Shit, shit, shit!

01:33:23.583 --> 01:33:25.082
C'mon guys!

01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:27.332
The early bird doesn't get the worm.

01:33:27.833 --> 01:33:29.707
- Here's to Samuel!
- Cheers.

01:33:29.875 --> 01:33:31.666
C'mon, Jules. Have a drink.

01:33:31.875 --> 01:33:34.207
At worst he'll be a mongoloid.

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:35.874
We'll love him no matter what.

01:33:36.042 --> 01:33:38.624
Keep it up
and I won't call him Tim or Sam.

01:33:38.792 --> 01:33:39.791
Listen to the boss.

01:33:39.958 --> 01:33:42.166
You could call him Omar.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.082
Omar's not bad.

01:33:44.250 --> 01:33:47.749
We busted ass when all we had to do
was turn him in.

01:33:47.917 --> 01:33:49.832
No, it was an emergency.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.332
I'd have preferred
the code of the 'hood.

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:53.707
Definitely.

01:33:53.875 --> 01:33:54.999
Here you go.

01:33:59.375 --> 01:34:00.666
What's up, Sam?

01:34:01.583 --> 01:34:02.874
Not treating?

01:34:03.583 --> 01:34:05.332
It's better if I don't.

01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:08.082
Then okay. Yeppa!

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.791
You didn't stress the right syllable.

01:34:12.958 --> 01:34:14.416
Give it some pizzazz.

01:34:16.042 --> 01:34:18.416
I'm paying, so I do it my way.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.207
The machine, please.

01:34:20.375 --> 01:34:21.166
Thanks, Vad.

01:34:21.333 --> 01:34:22.832
Don't mention it.

01:34:29.292 --> 01:34:31.082
We're not making noise.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.291
Your neighbor's been badly beaten.

01:34:42.458 --> 01:34:43.916
Did you hear anything?

01:34:44.458 --> 01:34:45.749
Mr. Limoges was attacked?

01:34:45.917 --> 01:34:47.291
That's right.

01:34:47.625 --> 01:34:49.916
No, we didn't hear a thing.

01:34:50.375 --> 01:34:51.457
Are you sure?

01:34:51.625 --> 01:34:53.166
Yes, I'm sure.

01:34:53.625 --> 01:34:55.166
Very well. 'Evening.

01:34:55.333 --> 01:34:56.499
Good evening.

01:35:15.458 --> 01:35:18.082
We'll murda you

01:35:34.792 --> 01:35:37.082
Bangkok - all airports

01:35:40.125 --> 01:35:41.707
What's going on, man?

01:35:42.708 --> 01:35:43.832
We're outta here.

01:35:45.125 --> 01:35:48.957
24 hours later

01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:58.916
I never imagined
we'd go through all that.

01:35:59.417 --> 01:36:01.707
But it taught me one thing:

01:36:02.625 --> 01:36:05.499
You can go to the end of the world
for a friend.

01:36:05.667 --> 01:36:07.582
There's lots of words for friends.

01:36:08.042 --> 01:36:09.207
I can say

01:36:09.375 --> 01:36:10.582
my brother, my pal,

01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:12.082
my sidekick, my soul mate,

01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:13.249
my comrade.

01:36:14.042 --> 01:36:16.082
All words for something rare.

01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:17.332
"...a second chance."

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.291
Someone who's not your family

01:36:19.458 --> 01:36:22.041
or your lover
but who you love deeply.

01:36:22.583 --> 01:36:25.124
But there's something odd
about friendship.

01:36:25.292 --> 01:36:26.207
For instance,

01:36:26.375 --> 01:36:28.916
you can't question family.

01:36:29.792 --> 01:36:33.957
You have the same name,
the same blood, stuff that binds you

01:36:34.125 --> 01:36:35.999
to other family members.

01:36:36.375 --> 01:36:38.666
Family is beyond question.

01:36:39.167 --> 01:36:41.249
Same goes for couples.

01:36:41.792 --> 01:36:44.666
Rules reassure us about our status.

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:46.707
You say "I love you,"

01:36:46.875 --> 01:36:48.249
you hold hands,

01:36:48.417 --> 01:36:51.624
you give Valentine's gifts
and even an engagement ring,

01:36:51.792 --> 01:36:53.124
then you have kids.

01:36:53.917 --> 01:36:55.249
Once again,

01:36:55.625 --> 01:36:57.457
family is beyond question.

01:36:59.750 --> 01:37:01.041
On the other hand,

01:37:01.208 --> 01:37:03.707
friendship is a lot less clear.

01:37:04.042 --> 01:37:05.999
You don't have to be faithful,

01:37:06.167 --> 01:37:08.416
no reason to be jealous.

01:37:08.625 --> 01:37:12.624
No ring, no ceremony,
no champagne to celebrate friendship.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.666
Yet of all life's relationships,

01:37:15.833 --> 01:37:19.082
friendships are likely
to last the longest.

01:37:30.708 --> 01:37:32.082
It'll be all right.

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:37.624
Good thing you're here.

01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:40.041
They say love affairs end badly

01:37:40.208 --> 01:37:42.791
and that you can't choose
your family.

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:46.332
But we can say we chose ours.
