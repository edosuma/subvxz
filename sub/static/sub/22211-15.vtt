00:00.018 --> 00:02.467
Previously on The Flash
and Legends of Tomorrow...

00:02.468 --> 00:04.960
- I love you, Jesse.
- I love you too.

00:04.961 --> 00:06.336
Jesse's breaking up with me.

00:06.337 --> 00:08.885
She told me she needs
to focus on herself.

00:08.886 --> 00:10.150
You and Ms. Lance?

00:10.151 --> 00:12.368
I think there's something
real there, she's special.

00:12.369 --> 00:14.470
I'm guessing that's bad.

00:14.471 --> 00:16.706
Those are tears in the
fabric of time itself.

00:16.707 --> 00:20.409
The first totem bearers
imprisoned a great evil

00:20.410 --> 00:22.077
and time is his cage.

00:22.078 --> 00:23.746
The more the timeline's corrupted,

00:23.747 --> 00:26.014
the weaker the prison
holding Mallus becomes.

00:26.015 --> 00:27.850
Maybe these totems are
the keys to stopping him.

00:27.851 --> 00:29.818
The good news is, we
already have the Air,

00:29.819 --> 00:32.588
- Earth, and Fire Totem.
- Death Totem?

00:32.589 --> 00:34.456
The most volatile of all of the totems.

00:34.457 --> 00:36.592
Whoever wields it has
dominion over the dead.

00:36.593 --> 00:39.829
We need to make sure we keep
that Death Totem on lock.

01:15.781 --> 01:18.517
You thought I forgot about you.

01:22.521 --> 01:24.423
It's okay. Hey, I'm right here.

01:25.758 --> 01:26.926
It's okay.

01:28.294 --> 01:32.364
Here I thought you gave
nightmares, not have them.

01:32.365 --> 01:34.666
First time for everything.

01:34.667 --> 01:35.667
Wanna talk about it?

01:35.668 --> 01:38.838
No, I'm... I'm fine.

01:42.141 --> 01:44.843
- So, who's John?
- What?

01:44.844 --> 01:46.711
Soon as you called his
name out in your sleep,

01:46.712 --> 01:50.114
and I was trying very
hard not to be jealous.

01:51.650 --> 01:56.421
No, it's probably John Constantine.

01:56.422 --> 01:58.990
He's a Demonologist that
helped me with Mallus.

01:58.991 --> 02:00.391
And he kinda looks like Sting.

02:00.392 --> 02:01.893
And he's just a... just a friend?

02:01.894 --> 02:04.997
Yeah, you could say that.

02:07.199 --> 02:09.532
Though we did sleep together, but...

02:10.639 --> 02:12.003
It was the '60s,

02:12.004 --> 02:15.206
and everybody was getting wild.

02:15.207 --> 02:16.908
The '60s, huh?

02:16.909 --> 02:19.677
I thought I waited a long
time between partners.

02:19.678 --> 02:23.814
The year was 1969, but...

02:23.815 --> 02:27.251
it was, like, three weeks ago.

02:27.252 --> 02:28.286
Three weeks?

02:28.287 --> 02:29.688
Yeah, well, three weeks

02:29.689 --> 02:33.491
before I had a girlfriend.

02:33.492 --> 02:36.561
Did you just call me your girlfriend?

02:36.562 --> 02:38.796
Maybe.

02:39.078 --> 02:41.366
I mean, why not?

02:41.367 --> 02:42.601
John's fun.

02:42.879 --> 02:44.102
Oh, please don't talk about John.

02:44.103 --> 02:46.272
Well, he is no Ava Sharpe.

02:47.606 --> 02:49.140
Pardon the interruption, Captain,

02:49.141 --> 02:50.441
but you're needed on the bridge.

02:50.862 --> 02:52.118
Oh, come on.

02:53.812 --> 02:55.179
Hey.

02:55.180 --> 02:56.415
Morning, Captain.

02:56.416 --> 02:57.716
Where's Mrs. Captain?

02:57.717 --> 02:59.417
No, Ava had to work.

02:59.418 --> 03:02.321
With all the new anachronisms,
the time tears are getting worse.

03:02.322 --> 03:04.455
Yeah, I thought we were
calling them time cracks.

03:04.456 --> 03:07.659
Hey, what happens if
we don't repair history?

03:07.660 --> 03:10.295
Working theory: time
is frapped together

03:10.296 --> 03:12.664
like a smoothie, so
instead of just dealing

03:12.665 --> 03:14.265
with Julius Caesar in Aruba,

03:14.266 --> 03:15.766
we have to fight off Genghis Khan,

03:15.767 --> 03:17.435
a herd of wooly mammoths, and a swarm of

03:17.436 --> 03:18.670
locusts from the Old Testament.

03:18.671 --> 03:20.839
And Mallus is freed from time jail,

03:20.840 --> 03:23.941
so he could rule over this giant mess.

03:24.542 --> 03:26.878
So, worse than Flashpoint?

03:26.879 --> 03:28.779
Is that what we're calling
the thing that Barry did?

03:28.780 --> 03:30.281
I think it's something similar.

03:30.282 --> 03:32.116
All right, enough hand wringing.

03:32.117 --> 03:33.852
Mallus and his team are doubling down

03:33.853 --> 03:35.553
on anachronisms, so, so are we.

03:35.554 --> 03:39.891
From now on, we're gonna
do our repairs in teams.

03:39.892 --> 03:42.727
Where's Rory?

03:42.728 --> 03:45.430
Wally, wait.

03:46.636 --> 03:48.566
Nice robe.

03:48.567 --> 03:50.535
Who dressed me?

03:51.166 --> 03:51.836
Me.

03:51.837 --> 03:54.372
FYI, Heat Wave sleeps in the nude.

03:54.373 --> 03:56.107
Yeah, tried to warn you, kid.

03:56.108 --> 03:58.142
As riveting as this conversation is,

03:58.143 --> 04:00.612
Gideon, please.

04:00.613 --> 04:02.314
So, Z and Amaya,

04:02.315 --> 04:05.550
you take the Time Courier to
Billings, Montana in 1997.

04:05.551 --> 04:07.885
The Mona Lisa is about make
a very special appearance

04:07.886 --> 04:09.387
on the Antiques Roadshow.

04:09.388 --> 04:13.024
Nate and I will pick up
Einstein in the Ice Age,

04:13.025 --> 04:16.994
and you two are on the Jumpship to

04:16.995 --> 04:19.096
find and return a dog named Laika

04:19.098 --> 04:21.265
to the Soviet space program.

04:21.266 --> 04:23.835
No.

04:23.836 --> 04:25.036
Excuse me?

04:25.037 --> 04:27.605
I'm not chasing a Ruskie pooch.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.943
I could actually use Mick's help
reforming the Fire Totem.

04:31.710 --> 04:33.044
Fine.

04:33.045 --> 04:35.079
Nate, you go with Wally,

04:35.080 --> 04:37.382
and I'll go get Einstein alone.

04:39.051 --> 04:40.284
Are you okay?

04:40.285 --> 04:42.186
Yeah, do...

04:42.187 --> 04:44.321
I'm fine. All right, that's it.

04:44.322 --> 04:47.859
No snazzy send-off.
Mama's got a headache.

04:47.860 --> 04:50.596
Even when you don't
try, you still got it.

04:58.170 --> 05:00.638
My hypothesis is that the Fire Totem

05:00.639 --> 05:03.841
can only be reignited if it
reaches Big Bang conditions.

05:04.937 --> 05:06.012
Which is where this

05:06.013 --> 05:08.179
handy-dandy cold fusion reactor comes in.

05:08.180 --> 05:10.181
We will be two of the only people to have

05:10.182 --> 05:12.750
ever experienced cold fusion in action.

05:12.751 --> 05:14.185
Can you even imagine?

05:14.479 --> 05:15.921
I'm bored.

05:18.893 --> 05:20.324
Wait, where are you going?

05:20.325 --> 05:22.160
What if I need your help?

05:22.161 --> 05:24.896
I... I just put a mystical totem
into a nuclear reactor.

05:24.897 --> 05:26.397
Don't you wanna see what happens?

05:26.398 --> 05:27.733
No.

05:36.241 --> 05:37.475
Do me a favor, Gideon,

05:37.476 --> 05:39.411
get John Constantine on the line.

05:39.412 --> 05:42.894
I'm afraid Mr. Constantine
does not currently own a phone.

05:42.895 --> 05:45.951
Because God forbid
he'd do anything normal.

06:26.125 --> 06:29.227
It calls to you, doesn't it?

06:29.228 --> 06:32.898
The Death Totem chose you.

06:35.134 --> 06:37.569
- You're...
- You.

06:37.570 --> 06:40.138
After you died.

06:40.139 --> 06:41.973
This is the Death Totem.

06:41.974 --> 06:43.741
It yearns for a new bearer.

06:43.742 --> 06:49.214
Imagine all you could do
with dominion over the dead.

06:49.215 --> 06:53.651
You could banish that little
girl from your dreams,

06:53.652 --> 06:55.220
bring back your sister.

06:58.857 --> 07:00.901
I'm no totem bearer.

07:00.902 --> 07:02.560
You've conquered your demons.

07:02.561 --> 07:03.861
You're strong enough to wield it.

07:03.862 --> 07:05.730
Pick up the totem, Sara.

07:06.029 --> 07:08.165
It's the only way to defeat Mallus.

07:08.269 --> 07:11.569
The six totems need six totem bearers.

07:11.755 --> 07:14.606
Who else on your team was
born to wield death?

07:24.031 --> 07:28.827
www.TUSUBTITULO.com
-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

07:32.724 --> 07:35.326
Wait, wait, wait, so the
Mona Lisa was a self-portrait?

07:35.327 --> 07:37.094
Da Vinci in drag.

07:37.095 --> 07:38.729
Wow.

07:38.730 --> 07:42.166
Mick?

07:42.167 --> 07:43.901
What? What? What? What?

07:43.902 --> 07:46.004
Well, at least he's wearing clothes.

07:46.005 --> 07:48.105
- True.
- Hey, Ray, we're back.

07:48.106 --> 07:49.641
You read me, Schmience guy?

07:51.444 --> 07:53.077
Gideon? Where's Ray?

07:53.078 --> 07:54.383
I'm sorry, Ms. Tomaz,

07:54.384 --> 07:57.114
but all of my internal monitoring
systems have been disabled.

07:57.115 --> 07:59.384
I've been rendered blind, I'm afraid.

08:00.426 --> 08:01.653
Ray!

08:05.157 --> 08:07.191
I can't tell if he's breathing.

08:07.192 --> 08:09.060
I have a pulse.

08:10.362 --> 08:11.896
It's smoking.

08:11.897 --> 08:14.732
This just happened.

08:14.733 --> 08:18.236
Whoever did this is still on the ship.

08:18.237 --> 08:19.904
Gideon, run a scan.

08:19.905 --> 08:21.572
Dr. Palmer has suffered
a collapsed lung,

08:21.573 --> 08:23.107
three broken ribs, a
shattered femur and...

08:23.108 --> 08:24.575
Okay, okay, okay, we get it.

08:24.576 --> 08:27.011
Just fix him and find out
who disabled your cams.

08:27.012 --> 08:28.746
I take one lousy nap...

08:28.747 --> 08:31.015
If I was capable of
rage, I would feel it.

08:31.016 --> 08:32.817
The saboteur must be punished.

08:32.818 --> 08:34.051
You stay with Ray.

08:34.052 --> 08:35.586
Mick and I will search the ship.

08:35.587 --> 08:38.056
Wait, guys, you don't
know what's out there.

08:39.256 --> 08:41.192
Second thought, you got this.

08:55.707 --> 08:57.308
Gideon, we need to reach Sara.

08:57.309 --> 08:59.511
Is there any way to message
her in the Ice Age?

08:59.512 --> 09:01.011
There's no need.

09:01.012 --> 09:03.849
The Jumpship never left its hangar.

09:07.085 --> 09:08.953
Holy mother of God.

09:08.954 --> 09:11.689
Sara, what happened?

09:11.690 --> 09:13.926
Sara Lance is lost to you.

09:16.462 --> 09:18.963
I am...

09:18.964 --> 09:20.333
Death!

09:43.158 --> 09:45.313
Sara,

09:45.314 --> 09:46.661
I know you're still in there.

09:46.662 --> 09:49.731
Know you're still in there.

09:53.035 --> 09:56.571
Amaya?

09:56.572 --> 09:58.974
She can't hear you.

10:00.709 --> 10:01.577
Mallus.

10:01.578 --> 10:04.913
You've always secretly
feared you're a monster.

10:04.914 --> 10:08.750
And now, a monster is what you've become.

10:08.751 --> 10:10.085
Sara, please, no!

10:30.673 --> 10:32.240
Amaya! What happened?

10:32.241 --> 10:34.242
It's Sara. She's wearing
the Death thingy.

10:34.243 --> 10:35.047
The Death Totem?

10:35.048 --> 10:37.112
But why would Elvis' totem make Sara evil?

10:37.113 --> 10:40.015
The totems work by
amplifying the true nature

10:40.016 --> 10:41.449
of... of whoever wears them.

10:41.450 --> 10:43.317
But Constantine warned Ray

10:43.318 --> 10:45.453
that Mallus' power was inside Sara.

10:45.454 --> 10:47.122
Maybe he's taken her over.

10:47.123 --> 10:49.791
So, if Elvis could raise
the dead with a totem,

10:49.792 --> 10:51.092
what could a former assassin

10:51.093 --> 10:52.862
connected to a demon be capable of?

10:55.531 --> 10:57.431
Captain Lance, I strongly recommend

10:57.432 --> 10:59.001
you reconsider this command.

11:04.139 --> 11:06.007
Hey...

11:06.008 --> 11:09.762
so I was thinking about the whole GF
conversation we had earlier, and I...

11:13.030 --> 11:14.031
You look...

11:14.790 --> 11:16.418
Good, great.

11:16.419 --> 11:17.652
Just, sometimes these holo-feeds

11:17.653 --> 11:19.588
can really wash out your skin.

11:19.589 --> 11:21.524
Did you do something
different with your hair?

11:26.495 --> 11:27.997
What the hell is going on here?

11:29.631 --> 11:32.801
Mr. Rory, would you please move?

11:32.802 --> 11:35.423
Sara's bonded with the Death Totem.

11:35.424 --> 11:36.504
What?!

11:36.505 --> 11:38.273
We think Mallus tricked
her into wearing it.

11:38.274 --> 11:40.141
Look, the woman on that
bridge was not Sara.

11:40.142 --> 11:42.010
All I care about right
now is getting her back.

11:42.011 --> 11:44.245
We need to find John Constantine.

11:44.246 --> 11:45.847
The demonologist?

11:45.848 --> 11:47.615
Yeah, I know, he wears
his tie a little too loose

11:47.616 --> 11:50.785
for my liking, but he has saved
Sara from Mallus before.

11:50.786 --> 11:52.620
Gideon, can you up my pain medication?

11:52.621 --> 11:54.789
My leg is killing me.

11:55.554 --> 11:56.290
Gideon?

11:56.291 --> 11:58.260
The Nostromo sequence
has been activated

11:58.261 --> 12:01.062
and will commence in T
minus three seconds.

12:01.063 --> 12:02.797
- T minus two seconds.
- NOSTROMO SEQUENCE

12:02.798 --> 12:04.332
Gideon, un-commence.

12:04.333 --> 12:06.669
That option has expired.

12:08.975 --> 12:10.466
Door's locked.

12:10.467 --> 12:11.506
I'm gonna kill that witch!

12:11.507 --> 12:13.474
If you kill her, then Sara dies too.

12:13.475 --> 12:15.276
- Better her than me.
- Dude, how can you say that?

12:15.277 --> 12:17.011
- By moving my lips.
- Hey, guys?

12:17.012 --> 12:18.280
And where were you when
Ray was getting the crap

12:18.281 --> 12:19.681
beat out of him? Day-drinking again?!

12:19.682 --> 12:21.316
Better than kidnapping a dog!

12:21.317 --> 12:23.651
- We rescued the dog, Mick!
- I'm claustrophobic!

12:23.652 --> 12:25.554
Everyone, just stop yelling.

12:30.292 --> 12:31.860
Guys, everyone just relax.

12:31.861 --> 12:33.561
I'm gonna knock her out, tie her up,

12:33.562 --> 12:35.964
and no one gets hurt.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.501
Oh, we're screwed.

12:57.119 --> 12:58.786
Wally.

12:58.787 --> 13:00.488
Hey.

13:00.489 --> 13:03.024
Never thought we'd see each other again.

13:03.025 --> 13:04.358
You look good.

13:04.359 --> 13:06.294
This isn't you. You're not real.

13:06.295 --> 13:08.830
You sure about that?

13:08.831 --> 13:12.267
Yeah. I've seen apparitions before.

13:12.268 --> 13:13.535
You know, I remember the first night

13:13.536 --> 13:16.170
I said, "I love you"

13:16.171 --> 13:17.872
We were in the back seat of your car.

13:17.873 --> 13:20.141
You acted like you couldn't hear me.

13:20.142 --> 13:22.176
Yeah, 'cause I couldn't understand

13:22.177 --> 13:24.112
why someone like you would love me.

13:24.113 --> 13:25.179
Why not?

13:25.180 --> 13:26.948
Oh, come on, Jesse.

13:26.949 --> 13:28.817
Wally, you're a good-looking guy.

13:28.818 --> 13:30.418
Great smile.

13:30.419 --> 13:32.520
I know you've had girlfriends before me.

13:32.521 --> 13:34.756
None of them were you.

13:34.757 --> 13:35.856
You're everything.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.625
You're, like, an actual genius,

13:37.626 --> 13:40.361
and the family you come
from, and then I...

13:40.362 --> 13:44.132
You're just a speed junkie
with a drug addict for a mom?

13:44.133 --> 13:47.368
I wonder why it didn't
work out between us.

13:49.838 --> 13:52.507
So you're just here to hurt me?

13:53.643 --> 13:56.077
Well, you can't.

13:56.078 --> 13:59.914
I'm... I'm actually glad
that you broke my heart.

13:59.915 --> 14:03.151
You know, I traveled because of you.

14:03.152 --> 14:04.519
I found some kind of inner peace.

14:04.520 --> 14:07.288
I made new friends.

14:07.289 --> 14:09.490
One day I'm gonna fall
in love with someone,

14:09.491 --> 14:14.362
and that person isn't gonna be you.

14:14.363 --> 14:17.432
Well said.

14:17.433 --> 14:19.467
Unfortunately...

14:19.468 --> 14:21.570
I can hurt you.

14:34.258 --> 14:36.271
NEW YORK CITY 2018

14:36.272 --> 14:38.274
John Constantine, age 36,

14:38.275 --> 14:40.843
one older sister, both parents deceased?

14:42.046 --> 14:43.279
He's part of the Newcastle crew.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.914
He accidentally summoned a demon

14:44.915 --> 14:47.817
that dragged a child,
Astra Logue, into Hell.

14:47.818 --> 14:49.051
Sounds like a real weirdo.

14:49.052 --> 14:50.486
He's a Warlock.

14:50.487 --> 14:52.688
You know, I happen to be
a level nine Warlock.

14:52.689 --> 14:54.224
Dungeons & Dragons doesn't count, Gary.

14:57.394 --> 14:58.695
Stay back.

15:01.965 --> 15:03.499
Don't move, Gary.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.867
Gonna get you. I'm gonna...

15:04.868 --> 15:06.102
What the...

15:07.337 --> 15:08.537
All right, all right.

15:08.538 --> 15:10.306
Go on, go, go!

15:10.307 --> 15:11.341
Okay.

15:12.843 --> 15:14.311
Hey, do us a favor. Give
us a hand, will you?

15:16.947 --> 15:18.248
Grab it, grab it, grab it!

15:19.516 --> 15:21.383
Ah, oh, there you are.

15:21.384 --> 15:23.219
All right... nice one, lad.

15:23.220 --> 15:24.954
You're a feisty little
bastard, aren't you?

15:24.955 --> 15:27.189
Are you guys from Housing co-op?

15:27.190 --> 15:29.758
Because it's perfectly legal
to win an apartment in a duel.

15:29.759 --> 15:31.294
We're here about Sara Lance.

15:32.863 --> 15:34.530
Right, well,

15:34.531 --> 15:37.633
Mrs. Veras, we will have to

15:37.634 --> 15:39.768
continue the ritual tomorrow.

15:39.769 --> 15:41.437
But not to worry, love.

15:41.438 --> 15:43.205
We'll have your son married
in no time, all right?

15:44.619 --> 15:45.889
Great.

15:51.081 --> 15:52.849
It's a gig economy.

15:52.850 --> 15:55.785
I have to take the work where
I can find it, you know?

15:55.786 --> 15:57.620
Now, let me guess.

15:57.621 --> 16:00.422
Sara has succumbed to the demon Mallus.

16:00.423 --> 16:02.992
I sensed his power
growing, but not to worry,

16:02.993 --> 16:05.127
I gave Ray very specific instructions

16:05.128 --> 16:06.763
to kill her if that ever happened.

16:06.764 --> 16:09.232
- What?
- Eggs and omelets, love.

16:09.233 --> 16:11.600
And extreme measures.

16:11.601 --> 16:13.536
Well, I'm here to save Sara.

16:13.537 --> 16:16.539
She's bonded with the Death Totem.

16:17.970 --> 16:20.323
- Oh, bollocks.
- What does that mean?

16:20.324 --> 16:21.910
Oh, it's a British expletive used to...

16:21.911 --> 16:23.012
I know what bollocks means, Gary.

16:23.013 --> 16:24.447
What did you mean by it?

16:24.448 --> 16:27.149
Well, about this so-called Death Totem.

16:27.150 --> 16:30.085
Recently, whilst heavily
influenced by ayahuasca,

16:30.086 --> 16:33.589
I came to learn why the
sixth lost tribe of Zambesi

16:33.590 --> 16:35.658
was stricken from the oral record.

16:35.659 --> 16:38.161
This lost tribe,

16:38.162 --> 16:40.128
which had been entrusted to watch over

16:40.129 --> 16:42.598
the domain of the dead, sided with Mallus

16:42.599 --> 16:46.302
while the other five tribes
rallied to imprison him,

16:46.303 --> 16:47.904
perhaps explaining why the Death Totem

16:47.905 --> 16:50.273
is inextricably linked
with our demon friend.

16:50.274 --> 16:52.174
Wally, can you hear me?

16:52.175 --> 16:53.776
Wally, talk to me, man.

16:53.777 --> 16:55.444
Kid's dead.

16:55.445 --> 16:56.612
I gotta go after him.

16:56.613 --> 16:58.314
Just be careful out there.

16:58.315 --> 17:00.283
If I'm not back in five minutes...

17:00.284 --> 17:01.450
Just wait longer?

17:01.451 --> 17:02.786
No, come rescue me.

17:06.289 --> 17:08.324
Okay, guys, this is ridiculous.

17:08.325 --> 17:09.558
We can't just wait here.

17:09.559 --> 17:11.327
Sara's gonna take us out one by one.

17:11.328 --> 17:16.065
But I can decouple the Jumpship
from Gideon's mainframe.

17:16.066 --> 17:18.134
We are getting off of this ship.

17:18.135 --> 17:21.704
Sara's soul is likely
trapped in Mallus' realm.

17:21.704 --> 17:23.338
Now, usually,

17:23.339 --> 17:26.208
I'd have to cast the demon
into myself to rescue her,

17:26.209 --> 17:29.612
but luckily, I already have
a link to Sara's soul.

17:29.613 --> 17:32.615
So I'll enlist Aken,

17:32.616 --> 17:34.983
the Egyptian ferryman of the dead,

17:34.984 --> 17:37.586
What do you mean you already
have a link to Sara's soul?

17:37.587 --> 17:40.256
Well, let's just say
our souls have been one.

17:40.257 --> 17:42.558
Leaves a metaphysical connection, love.

17:42.559 --> 17:45.061
- Don't call me, "love."
- Oh, pardon me, pet.

17:45.062 --> 17:47.329
Sara and I also share a very,

17:47.330 --> 17:49.565
very strong metaphysical
connection, so...

17:49.566 --> 17:52.034
Wait. I can't believe...

17:52.035 --> 17:53.703
You both slept with Captain Lance?

17:53.704 --> 17:56.438
- Gary.
- Did we now?

17:56.439 --> 17:57.940
Well then, we both have

17:57.941 --> 18:00.275
excellent taste in damaged women.

18:00.276 --> 18:01.610
- Sara's not damaged.
- Yeah.

18:01.611 --> 18:03.145
And I'm the bloody Pope.

18:03.146 --> 18:05.014
You know what? Let's get on with this.

18:05.516 --> 18:06.949
What the hell do you think you're doing?

18:06.950 --> 18:09.051
You're going after Sara,
I'm coming with you.

18:09.052 --> 18:11.353
To the realm of Mallus?

18:11.354 --> 18:13.222
Start chanting.

18:14.390 --> 18:16.260
Very well, give me your hand.

18:18.962 --> 18:21.364
Are you serious?

18:21.365 --> 18:22.365
Deadly.

18:27.861 --> 18:31.440
Mallus, Aken, Ka, Ren, Ba, Ib, Sheut,

18:31.441 --> 18:33.276
Mallus Aken Ma'at.

18:33.711 --> 18:37.842
Mallus, Aken, Ka, Ren, Ba, Ib, Sheut,

18:37.843 --> 18:40.212
Mallus Aken Ma'at.

18:41.618 --> 18:44.353
John Constantine.

18:44.354 --> 18:46.856
You dare enter my realm?

19:06.442 --> 19:10.312
So any sign of the Captain, Nate?

19:10.313 --> 19:12.015
No, but I found Wally.

19:14.117 --> 19:15.417
Is he...

19:15.418 --> 19:17.086
Alive.

19:17.087 --> 19:19.922
Sara must have shot him with
the anti-speedster gun.

19:19.923 --> 19:23.625
We're gonna need a bigger Medbay.

19:23.626 --> 19:25.394
Don't worry, guys, I'm almost there.

19:25.395 --> 19:27.030
Just get ready to meet
me at the Jumpship.

19:32.035 --> 19:34.570
Sorry, Gideon, this is gonna
hurt you more than me.

19:38.207 --> 19:40.077
Zari?

19:47.217 --> 19:49.485
Behrad...

19:49.486 --> 19:51.754
I can't sleep.

19:51.755 --> 19:54.590
Will you read me a story, Zari?

19:54.591 --> 19:56.759
No, no, this is...
this is the Death Totem

19:56.760 --> 19:59.361
messing with my mind, you're not real.

19:59.362 --> 20:01.130
Of course I am.

20:01.131 --> 20:02.865
Please. You know the one.

20:02.866 --> 20:05.601
"The Prince of Timbuktu."

20:05.602 --> 20:07.370
Please stop.

20:07.371 --> 20:11.941
"The Prince of Timbuktu took
a swim in the ocean blue"

20:11.942 --> 20:14.744
"He met a tortoise who
told him his purpose

20:14.745 --> 20:17.880
was to be the king of Timbuktu."

20:19.949 --> 20:21.217
Behrad.

20:24.554 --> 20:25.788
Goodbye.

21:05.595 --> 21:07.929
Sara, stop, please.

21:07.930 --> 21:10.132
Sara...

21:10.133 --> 21:12.901
You have to fight Mallus.

21:12.902 --> 21:14.203
Stop!

21:17.773 --> 21:19.642
You're hurting me.

21:21.444 --> 21:24.080
Impressive.

21:24.081 --> 21:26.649
But no one can fight Mallus forever.

21:37.878 --> 21:39.980
What have you got on your
socks there, squire?

21:40.990 --> 21:42.018
Oh, it's Beebo.

21:42.019 --> 21:43.398
My Aunt Stacy bought them for me.

21:43.399 --> 21:44.184
You like Beebo?

21:44.185 --> 21:45.719
Once, when I was on a massive bender,

21:45.720 --> 21:48.221
I put a spell on that
toy to make him talk.

21:48.222 --> 21:51.358
He told me things that'll
make your toes curl.

21:52.800 --> 21:53.294
Oh, like what?

21:53.295 --> 21:55.496
Okay, Sara's soul is trapped
in the realm of a demon

21:55.497 --> 21:57.531
and her ship and entire
crew are lost in time.

21:57.532 --> 21:58.799
Who cares about Beebo?

21:58.800 --> 22:00.534
Well, his Aunt Stacy does.

22:00.535 --> 22:03.270
You're wound tight as a bloody
drum, aren't you, love...

22:03.271 --> 22:04.771
pardon me, pet.

22:04.772 --> 22:06.373
You know, you need to loosen up.

22:06.374 --> 22:08.347
And then the work just flows.

22:08.348 --> 22:09.442
Oh, is that work you're doing?

22:09.443 --> 22:11.011
Sorry, I couldn't tell.

22:11.012 --> 22:12.879
There isn't exactly a
paint-by-number spell

22:12.880 --> 22:14.081
for locating a spaceship

22:14.082 --> 22:16.149
floating through a temporal stream.

22:16.150 --> 22:18.485
My business card says,
"Master of the Dark Arts,"

22:18.486 --> 22:20.454
not "Doctor Ruddy What's-His-Face."

22:20.455 --> 22:21.655
- Who?
- Who?

22:21.656 --> 22:22.956
Exactly.

22:22.957 --> 22:24.658
What? Okay, you know what, Gary?

22:24.659 --> 22:25.859
Let's just get outta here because Mr.
Constantine

22:25.860 --> 22:27.495
has wasted enough of our time.

22:27.496 --> 22:29.630
Oh, that's where you are. You beauty.

22:29.631 --> 22:31.665
Okay, so you have a foot,
but you don't have a phone?

22:31.666 --> 22:33.900
I... I just... I really don't
understand how Sara could've...

22:33.901 --> 22:35.669
What, shagged me in a mental institute?

22:35.670 --> 22:37.037
Oh, my God!

22:37.038 --> 22:38.339
Ah, you have nothing
to be jealous about.

22:38.340 --> 22:40.306
I am not jealous! I'm just...

22:41.676 --> 22:43.444
Okay, maybe I'm a little bit jealous.

22:43.445 --> 22:46.981
Ah, we were just trying to
find some calm in the storm.

22:46.982 --> 22:49.316
I don't understand, who
sleeps with a Warlock and then

22:49.317 --> 22:51.151
turns around and starts
calling me her girlfriend?

22:51.152 --> 22:53.119
She called you her girlfriend?

22:53.120 --> 22:55.622
Yeah, and I really wanna believe her.

22:55.623 --> 22:57.024
- But?
- But I don't think that

22:57.025 --> 22:58.692
Sara's really a one-woman woman.

22:58.693 --> 23:00.127
Well, if the price of
admission is looking like

23:00.128 --> 23:01.729
a fool or getting your heart broken,

23:01.730 --> 23:06.033
then, well, I'd say Ms. Lance
is pretty well worth it.

23:07.624 --> 23:08.469
Okay.

23:08.470 --> 23:12.539
Boys, there has to be a way
to find the Waverider.

23:12.540 --> 23:14.374
I have an idea.

23:14.375 --> 23:16.410
We're all ears, mate.

23:16.411 --> 23:19.179
The Legends remind me of my D&D group.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.881
- Don't laugh.
- Too late.

23:20.882 --> 23:23.750
And last year, we were on a campaign,

23:23.751 --> 23:26.686
"The Trials of Eagan."

23:26.687 --> 23:29.990
Our party was made up of a monk,

23:29.991 --> 23:32.760
a druid,

23:32.761 --> 23:35.628
a half-orc rogue,

23:35.629 --> 23:37.931
a bard,

23:37.932 --> 23:40.067
and like, a... like, a cheerful gnome

23:40.068 --> 23:43.170
who was also a very accomplished wizard.

23:43.171 --> 23:44.605
With two men down,

23:44.606 --> 23:47.875
we were trapped in the Tomb of Ruination,

23:47.876 --> 23:50.076
and we were being hunted
by Zanatar the Unburnt.

23:50.077 --> 23:51.611
We were exhausted,

23:51.612 --> 23:53.813
running low on food.

23:53.814 --> 23:55.016
Hungry.

23:57.385 --> 23:58.719
Zari, come in.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.320
Zari, do you copy?

24:00.321 --> 24:02.289
Our sorceress was missing, feared dead.

24:02.362 --> 24:04.984
Gary, how does any of this help
us find Sara and the Legends?

24:04.985 --> 24:06.493
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

24:06.494 --> 24:08.895
Let the man finish his story, all right?

24:08.896 --> 24:10.797
As you were, mate.

24:10.798 --> 24:13.500
Zanatar the Unburnt
wielded the Death Sword,

24:13.501 --> 24:15.635
one of the Six Swords of Sorrow.

24:15.636 --> 24:17.204
To defeat him, we needed...

24:17.205 --> 24:19.172
Another of the Six Swords.

24:19.173 --> 24:20.674
The best way to defeat a totem bearer

24:20.675 --> 24:22.009
is with another totem.

24:22.010 --> 24:23.277
Yeah, that worked out well for Z.

24:23.278 --> 24:25.212
Seeing as I am out of commission,

24:25.213 --> 24:27.047
one of you two needs to
wield the Earth Totem.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.583
Which turned Blackbeard's
lady friend into a zombie.

24:29.584 --> 24:32.786
It merely manifested the
pirate queen's true nature.

24:32.787 --> 24:34.488
A righteous warrior has nothing to fear

24:34.489 --> 24:35.789
from wielding a totem.

24:35.790 --> 24:38.458
A righteous warrior. Count me out.

24:38.459 --> 24:39.826
All right, well,

24:39.827 --> 24:42.896
Earth Totem, meet Steel Man.

24:42.897 --> 24:44.798
So how did your D&D crew thingy

24:44.799 --> 24:47.000
find one of the six Swords of Sorrow?

24:47.001 --> 24:49.269
We didn't, we died a grizzly
death at the hands of Zanatar.

24:49.270 --> 24:50.437
Gary!

24:50.438 --> 24:51.871
But, but,

24:51.872 --> 24:53.773
that's because we weren't
working in concert.

24:53.774 --> 24:55.175
The Legends will be fine as long as they

24:55.176 --> 24:56.509
just don't split up.

24:56.510 --> 24:58.211
Mick and I will find Zari.

24:58.212 --> 25:00.614
All right, and I'll
go get the Earth Totem.

25:00.615 --> 25:02.216
You're gonna die.

25:02.217 --> 25:04.284
- Hey.
- Thanks, Mick.

25:04.285 --> 25:06.387
You can do this.

25:15.896 --> 25:17.464
The point of my story is,

25:17.465 --> 25:19.399
even though we were defeated by Zanatar,

25:19.400 --> 25:20.901
we were able to track

25:20.902 --> 25:22.602
the mystical object he was wielding.

25:22.603 --> 25:24.971
The Sword of bloody Sorrow.

25:27.909 --> 25:31.444
You are a bloody genius, Barry.

25:31.445 --> 25:33.113
Gary.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.547
Gary, right.

25:34.548 --> 25:37.183
I need the vile from my desk,

25:37.184 --> 25:40.220
Mother's tears, and my ruination stones,

25:40.221 --> 25:42.689
and from you, Ava, I'm gonna need...

25:42.690 --> 25:44.258
- Oh, please don't say it.
- The foot.

25:49.831 --> 25:51.498
Sorry, can we just pretend for a moment

25:51.499 --> 25:52.900
that I have no idea
what you two are doing?

25:52.901 --> 25:54.501
Well, it's like our Gary said,

25:54.502 --> 25:56.769
the easiest way to
locate the Legends' ship

25:56.770 --> 25:58.772
is to locate the Death Totem.

26:05.746 --> 26:07.247
You know, it's a shame

26:07.248 --> 26:09.549
that you had to join the family business.

26:09.550 --> 26:11.251
You were a sweet kid.

26:11.252 --> 26:13.587
Last time we were here,
I was a little girl,

26:13.588 --> 26:15.722
but I was never sweet.

26:15.723 --> 26:17.290
Your friend, Oliver, made sure of that

26:17.291 --> 26:19.526
when he killed my father.

26:19.527 --> 26:22.629
Oliver's not responsible
for the path that you chose.

26:22.630 --> 26:25.331
You're right.

26:25.332 --> 26:27.801
You see, Sara, you and I,

26:27.802 --> 26:29.536
we're alike.

26:29.537 --> 26:31.605
The darkness has always been within us.

26:34.894 --> 26:37.244
Please.

26:38.114 --> 26:40.214
Ra's Al Ghul will never
know you let me live.

26:55.370 --> 26:57.765
Papi!

27:08.876 --> 27:12.046
Once a killer, always a killer.

28:16.295 --> 28:19.045
Why are you crying, Sara?

28:19.046 --> 28:21.381
You've done nothing wrong.

28:21.382 --> 28:24.183
Imagine what you could do if
you just released your guilt.

28:24.184 --> 28:26.753
You can't erase your past, Sara,

28:26.754 --> 28:31.090
so just embrace it.

28:31.091 --> 28:33.159
You want me to join your team.

28:33.160 --> 28:35.161
It's your destiny.

28:35.162 --> 28:38.198
Eons ago, the sixth tribe of Zambesi

28:38.199 --> 28:41.601
defended Mallus from their brethren.

28:41.602 --> 28:45.572
Their tribe wielded the Death Totem.

28:45.573 --> 28:48.141
Now the cycle's starting again.

28:48.142 --> 28:52.412
You weren't just born to
wield the Death Totem, Sara.

28:52.413 --> 28:55.616
You were born to wield the
Death Totem for Mallus.

28:59.620 --> 29:02.188
Z.

29:02.189 --> 29:04.657
I'm all right, barely.

29:04.658 --> 29:06.592
Nathaniel, we have Z.

29:06.593 --> 29:08.128
Did you find the Earth Totem?

29:08.129 --> 29:10.297
Actually I did, but,

29:10.298 --> 29:11.865
guys, Sara found me.

29:11.866 --> 29:13.200
Nathaniel, where are you?

29:17.171 --> 29:19.372
Nathaniel?

29:19.373 --> 29:21.808
What's the matter, Nathaniel?

29:21.809 --> 29:23.678
You look like you've seen a ghost.

29:27.381 --> 29:31.431
Nathaniel? Nathaniel, where are you?

29:31.432 --> 29:33.900
Right, the Fire Totem's our
last chance to defeat her.

29:33.901 --> 29:35.501
Oh, and here I thought

29:35.502 --> 29:37.670
escaping to the Jumpship was a good plan.

29:37.671 --> 29:38.676
I don't care what she's done.

29:38.677 --> 29:41.440
I'm not abandoning Sara or
anyone else on this team.

29:41.441 --> 29:42.908
Too bad, you're down a leg,

29:42.909 --> 29:44.777
and you look like a cat stuck in a dryer.

29:44.778 --> 29:46.412
That's not funny. I love cats.

29:46.413 --> 29:49.115
I'll wield the totem.
Let's just get to the lab.

29:49.116 --> 29:51.952
Here's hoping Ray knew what he was doing.

29:55.890 --> 29:58.457
Get a grip, Nate.

29:58.458 --> 29:59.960
That's not your grandfather.

29:59.961 --> 30:03.697
Houston, 1970.

30:03.698 --> 30:05.831
I wanted to be with my wife and son,

30:05.832 --> 30:09.035
but you convinced me that was impossible.

30:09.036 --> 30:13.406
You were relieved when I
blew the cargo bay door.

30:13.407 --> 30:15.074
I didn't want you to die.

30:15.075 --> 30:17.676
You were desperate
to save your own hide.

30:17.677 --> 30:20.413
And what have you made of yourself, boy?

30:20.414 --> 30:23.816
You're a damn disappointment
to your father,

30:23.817 --> 30:26.186
and you're sure as hell
a disappointment to me.

30:27.521 --> 30:29.155
You think Amaya loves you?

30:31.424 --> 30:32.859
You're not worthy of her love.

30:38.198 --> 30:39.599
There.

30:39.600 --> 30:42.736
Haircut nuked the stone.

30:48.242 --> 30:50.810
This totem wasn't meant for me.

30:50.811 --> 30:52.674
You have to use it.

30:52.675 --> 30:53.479
Forget it.

30:53.480 --> 30:56.416
You've spent your entire life
obsessed with fire and heat.

30:56.417 --> 30:57.720
What if this is the reason why?

30:57.721 --> 31:00.252
How many times do I have
to tell you I'm not a hero?!

31:00.253 --> 31:01.621
Sara's a hero,

31:01.622 --> 31:03.122
and look what the Death Totem did to her.

31:03.123 --> 31:04.757
That was the work of Mallus.

31:04.758 --> 31:06.393
Most people who've seen what you've seen

31:06.394 --> 31:08.127
would've succumbed to
darkness, but you didn't.

31:08.128 --> 31:10.529
You chose to become a Legend.

31:10.530 --> 31:12.565
You may try and hide it, Mick,

31:12.566 --> 31:15.034
but you're a good man.

31:15.035 --> 31:17.170
What if you're wrong?

31:17.171 --> 31:19.740
There's only one way to find out.

31:27.414 --> 31:28.881
Exorcizamus te,

31:28.882 --> 31:30.883
omnis immundus spiritius...

31:30.884 --> 31:34.420
Omnis satanic potestas,
omnis infernalis adversarii,

31:34.421 --> 31:36.689
in nomine at virtute Domini!

31:36.690 --> 31:38.024
Hit her with the holy water!

31:50.601 --> 31:52.967
There's somebody who
wants to talk to you, John.

31:55.809 --> 31:59.712
John?

31:59.713 --> 32:01.581
You glamoured your voice.

32:01.582 --> 32:04.684
That's the oldest bloody
trick in the book.

32:04.685 --> 32:07.053
You don't remember me?

32:07.054 --> 32:09.456
I know it's been a long time.

32:11.058 --> 32:12.191
Astra.

32:12.192 --> 32:14.193
Mallus will free me from hell,

32:14.194 --> 32:15.662
but you have to give him Sara.

32:15.663 --> 32:19.498
A life for a life. You
know better than anybody.

32:19.499 --> 32:22.902
Magic always has a price.

32:22.903 --> 32:24.271
I wanna speak to Sara.

32:26.339 --> 32:28.407
Okay.

32:28.408 --> 32:32.845
All right, Astra.

32:32.846 --> 32:37.216
I'll do it.

32:37.217 --> 32:40.586
Give me your hand, Astra.

32:40.587 --> 32:42.488
Come on.

32:42.489 --> 32:44.824
It's all right, love.

32:44.825 --> 32:46.625
It's just me.

32:46.626 --> 32:47.828
It's Johnny.

32:55.569 --> 32:57.236
No one escapes Hell.

32:57.237 --> 32:59.004
The sacred cross commands you

32:59.005 --> 33:00.640
to free this woman from your prison!

33:00.641 --> 33:02.976
To free this woman from your prison!

33:23.130 --> 33:25.164
Wielding a totem's bad enough.

33:25.165 --> 33:26.832
Now you want me to wear a necklace?

33:26.833 --> 33:28.268
There's no time, Mick.

33:32.339 --> 33:35.776
See? Doesn't work.

33:56.129 --> 33:58.131
Are you still with me, Mick?

34:19.418 --> 34:21.754
Sara!

34:21.755 --> 34:26.225
Sara? Sara?

34:26.226 --> 34:28.995
Does Ava know who you really are, Sara?

34:28.996 --> 34:30.696
What you've done?

34:30.697 --> 34:32.665
What are you gonna tell her?

34:32.666 --> 34:35.134
That the totem was wrong?

34:35.135 --> 34:37.737
You aren't a killer?

34:39.773 --> 34:41.639
The totem's power is within you, Sara,

34:41.641 --> 34:43.676
all you have to do is decide.

34:43.677 --> 34:48.748
A life free of pain and regret with us,

34:48.748 --> 34:52.650
or the tormented half-life
you're living now?

34:52.652 --> 34:54.485
Sara?

34:54.487 --> 34:57.423
I know you are still in there.

34:57.424 --> 35:00.093
You are the strongest,

35:00.094 --> 35:02.828
most fearless person I've ever met,

35:02.829 --> 35:04.563
and you never back down.

35:04.564 --> 35:07.700
Don't you remember?

35:07.701 --> 35:12.471
When did a Legend ever go quietly?

35:12.472 --> 35:14.407
I'm here.

35:14.408 --> 35:17.376
I'm here, Sara, and I need
you to come back to me.

35:17.377 --> 35:18.778
I need you to come home.

35:26.286 --> 35:28.155
Sara, can't you feel me?

35:47.040 --> 35:48.941
No.

35:48.942 --> 35:51.711
You're making a mistake.

35:51.712 --> 35:53.912
No,

35:53.913 --> 35:58.884
to a life without pain or regret.

35:58.885 --> 36:02.287
No, to being a demon's lackey,

36:02.288 --> 36:04.624
and no, to bringing more death

36:04.625 --> 36:07.627
into this world.

36:07.628 --> 36:10.329
I owe that little girl at least that.

36:10.330 --> 36:12.733
You could have everything.

36:37.023 --> 36:39.526
You saved me again.

36:42.896 --> 36:46.032
I had a little help.

36:46.033 --> 36:47.468
Well, while we're here...

36:48.802 --> 36:50.803
A light?

36:59.680 --> 37:01.581
Chin chin.

37:08.054 --> 37:10.257
I should definitely come
to your aid more often.

37:11.558 --> 37:13.459
Well, at this point,

37:13.460 --> 37:16.128
I might as well just make
you a bed on the ship.

37:16.992 --> 37:18.465
Tempting.

37:19.833 --> 37:23.135
If you thought Mallus
really would've freed Astra,

37:23.136 --> 37:26.372
you would have traded me, wouldn't you?

37:26.373 --> 37:27.706
In a heartbeat.

37:27.707 --> 37:28.941
Yeah.

37:28.942 --> 37:30.609
Well, what can I say?

37:30.610 --> 37:33.112
I'm a nasty piece of work.

37:33.113 --> 37:34.914
So am I.

37:34.915 --> 37:36.749
You survived, love.

37:36.750 --> 37:38.151
For now.

37:38.152 --> 37:39.518
You know, there's a reason why

37:39.519 --> 37:41.653
I prefer to walk this path alone.

37:41.654 --> 37:44.824
It's...

37:44.825 --> 37:47.460
so I don't have to share with anyone

37:47.461 --> 37:50.363
how lost I really am.

37:50.364 --> 37:53.099
But you're not alone, are you, Sara?

37:53.100 --> 37:54.533
Maybe I should be.

37:54.534 --> 37:57.069
She's a good one.

37:57.070 --> 37:59.339
Try not to hurt her.

37:59.340 --> 38:01.574
That's what I'm afraid of.

38:03.756 --> 38:04.764
Pinch me...

38:05.834 --> 38:06.806
Okay.

38:08.282 --> 38:09.983
Sara.

38:09.984 --> 38:12.385
Is it the real Sara?

38:12.386 --> 38:14.454
Yeah, it's me.

38:14.455 --> 38:16.422
I'm sorry, Ray.

38:16.423 --> 38:19.058
I'm...

38:19.059 --> 38:21.628
I'm sorry, everyone. I'm really sorry.

38:21.629 --> 38:23.629
It's good to have you back, Captain.

38:23.630 --> 38:26.333
Yeah, because evil you is
a pain in the ass to fight.

38:26.334 --> 38:28.034
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around this mess.

38:28.035 --> 38:30.503
Why would Mallus want to show me Jesse?

38:30.504 --> 38:32.872
- Or me my grandpa?
- I don't know.

38:32.873 --> 38:35.841
Mallus was trying to
recruit me to his side,

38:35.842 --> 38:37.810
and using my darkest fears.

38:37.811 --> 38:39.445
Maybe that's just what he does,

38:39.446 --> 38:41.147
he looks into our hearts,

38:41.148 --> 38:44.717
and broadcasts our deepest secrets.

38:44.810 --> 38:47.853
That's terrifying.

38:47.854 --> 38:49.522
Okay. You up.

38:49.523 --> 38:51.857
I need your speed to
re-couple the mainframe.

38:52.536 --> 38:54.694
Ah, music to my ears.

38:54.695 --> 38:55.961
Oh, although,

38:55.962 --> 38:59.767
I was really digging the silver hair.

39:02.803 --> 39:04.604
Hey.

39:04.605 --> 39:05.673
We need to talk.

39:07.474 --> 39:09.776
No good conversation
ever started that way.

39:09.777 --> 39:11.577
Ava, I'm sorry.

39:11.578 --> 39:13.279
Listen,

39:13.280 --> 39:15.514
I can't pretend to understand
what you went through

39:15.515 --> 39:17.416
or... or what happened to you, but I know

39:17.417 --> 39:18.484
that wasn't you, Sara.

39:18.485 --> 39:20.186
That's just it.

39:20.187 --> 39:21.587
That was me.

39:21.588 --> 39:23.756
Just like fire is to Rory,

39:23.757 --> 39:26.592
there is part of me that...

39:26.593 --> 39:28.128
it's always been there.

39:28.129 --> 39:32.999
And I really tried to pretend
that that wasn't true.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.336
But deep down,

39:36.337 --> 39:37.736
I am death.

39:37.737 --> 39:39.939
No... Sara, okay,

39:39.940 --> 39:41.707
so we can fight that
part of you together,

39:41.708 --> 39:43.676
- just tell me what to do.
- Hey.

39:43.677 --> 39:45.244
Ava, you read my file.

39:45.245 --> 39:47.112
But I still showed
up at that restaurant,

39:47.113 --> 39:49.916
in that horribly uncomfortable
dress trying to impress you

39:49.917 --> 39:51.351
because I don't care
about your past, Sara.

39:51.352 --> 39:54.620
Well, maybe you should.

39:54.621 --> 39:58.291
You are wonderful.

39:58.292 --> 40:01.628
And I...

40:02.963 --> 40:06.832
and I've never been
this happy in my life.

40:06.833 --> 40:08.968
But this doesn't look happy.

40:10.086 --> 40:11.304
Look, I don't deserve you.

40:11.305 --> 40:14.507
- Yes, Sara, yes, you do.
- No, Ava, I don't.

40:14.508 --> 40:17.276
You deserve better, you
deserve so much better.

40:17.277 --> 40:21.613
And I care about you, but...

40:21.614 --> 40:24.516
I'm not gonna do this. I won't.

40:24.517 --> 40:25.818
Sara.

40:25.819 --> 40:27.420
I'm sorry.

40:48.843 --> 40:51.477
Fresh from a successful crusade,

40:51.478 --> 40:55.214
our team knew the fight
was far from over.

40:55.215 --> 40:56.716
In fact,

40:56.717 --> 40:59.152
the true battle was only just beginning.

41:08.011 --> 41:09.729
THIS SPOT RESERVED FOR
THE GIRLFRIEND OF SARA LANCE

41:09.730 --> 41:13.499
In order to defeat the demon
and his cabal of evil,

41:13.500 --> 41:16.135
we need to be at full strength,

41:16.136 --> 41:18.004
which is going to be
hard given the losses

41:18.005 --> 41:21.374
we sustained on our last quest.

41:21.375 --> 41:25.378
Some wounds are so deep,
they never truly heal.

41:25.379 --> 41:28.981
So the question is,

41:28.982 --> 41:32.518
are you prepared to
join us on this mission

41:32.519 --> 41:34.454
most deadly?

41:39.726 --> 41:43.029
Well, tonight, squire,

41:43.030 --> 41:45.511
I'm all yours.
