Robin.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.456
Snap out, Robin.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.391
I must have passed out.

03:48.194 --> 03:50.495
Well, feels like
taking a 100 rides

03:50.497 --> 03:52.463
on a supersonic
roller coaster.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.799
One more revolution
of that wheel

03:54.801 --> 03:57.835
will probably
finish both of us.

03:57.837 --> 03:59.203
What happened?

03:59.205 --> 04:01.372
While they dragged
us down here, some of the..

04:01.374 --> 04:05.376
...web-like material tore away
from my hand and waist.

04:05.378 --> 04:08.179
I just barely managed
to get the cutting torch

04:08.181 --> 04:09.447
out of my utility belt.

04:09.649 --> 04:12.850
You burned the armature and
short-circuited the power.

04:12.852 --> 04:16.921
Golly, Batman,
the utility belt saves again.

04:16.923 --> 04:22.393
Now, old friend, it's time to
get back on The Riddler's trail.

04:29.535 --> 04:32.737
<i> The following morning</i>
<i> at the wallowing place</i>

04:32.739 --> 04:34.739
<i> of the evil river rats.</i>

04:34.741 --> 04:37.975
<i> Deep below Gotham City.</i>

04:43.015 --> 04:47.885
Rise and shine!

04:48.488 --> 04:51.489
Sorry, my dear rats
to disturb you all slumber

04:51.491 --> 04:55.059
but I believe
you are working for me.

04:55.061 --> 04:58.896
Then sleep on your own time!

05:00.066 --> 05:02.566
- Where's Mousey?
- She ain't here, chief.

05:02.568 --> 05:05.035
She'll be here soon.
You know her types.

05:05.037 --> 05:05.936
They're never on time.

05:05.938 --> 05:09.607
Time. Time's of the essence.
We have a tight schedule.

05:09.609 --> 05:10.708
Good morning.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.410
Late morning is more like it.

05:12.412 --> 05:13.811
You know I detest tardiness.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.579
I missed the bus! Big deal.

05:15.681 --> 05:17.214
It will be
if you miss the caper.

05:17.216 --> 05:20.651
We have a great many important
details to work over.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.153
Okay. I'm here. Relax.

05:23.155 --> 05:25.623
Yeah, Riddler,
this thing'll be a cinch.

05:25.625 --> 05:29.226
For once, we don't have to worry
about Batman and Robin.

05:29.228 --> 05:31.095
How true.

05:32.598 --> 05:35.633
So many people have tried.

05:36.368 --> 05:41.071
The Penguin, Mr. Freeze,
The Joker.

05:41.073 --> 05:43.373
All masters of their craft,
granted

05:43.375 --> 05:47.978
but I, only I have triumphed
in ridding

05:47.980 --> 05:52.816
Gotham City's criminal kingdom
of the dynamic duo.

05:52.818 --> 05:55.085
And good riddance it is.

05:55.087 --> 05:58.322
How frustrating it'll be for my
colleagues when they'll learn

05:58.324 --> 06:00.858
that I succeeded
where they failed.

06:00.860 --> 06:04.094
I'd sure like to see their faces
when they hear about it?

06:04.096 --> 06:05.896
They'll have no one
to outwit anymore.

06:05.898 --> 06:08.398
Regrettably, it is no longer
our problem.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.466
For tomorrow
we shall be

06:09.468 --> 06:12.069
miles and miles away
in another country.

06:12.071 --> 06:13.904
With all that beautiful
green dough.

06:13.906 --> 06:15.907
If everything goes
according to plan, that is.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.341
And why shouldn't it?

06:17.343 --> 06:18.809
What if they refuse to pay?

06:18.811 --> 06:20.177
I've left them no choice.

06:20.179 --> 06:22.613
And my plan is foolproof,
I promise you.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.248
I gotta go along
with The Riddler.

06:24.250 --> 06:27.251
- He ain't stood us wrong yet.
- Deeply touched.

06:27.253 --> 06:30.921
Whiskers, any problems last
night with my friend the king?

06:30.923 --> 06:33.123
- Took him back safe and sound.
- Good, good.

06:33.125 --> 06:37.327
Rats, I'm a man of few words
but a man of many riddles.

06:37.329 --> 06:38.162
So riddle me this

06:38.164 --> 06:42.966
what is it that is always coming
but never arrives?

06:42.968 --> 06:44.835
Quickly, quickly.

06:44.837 --> 06:48.338
We ain't tuned in
on the riddle bit, chief.

06:48.340 --> 06:50.374
Yeah. We give up.

06:50.376 --> 06:54.178
What is it that is always coming
but never arrives?

06:54.180 --> 06:55.179
Tomorrow.

06:55.181 --> 06:57.414
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

06:57.416 --> 07:01.251
But when it arrives,
it is today.

07:01.253 --> 07:04.288
And today, my dear rodents

07:04.290 --> 07:09.059
should prove to be most
memorable.

07:09.195 --> 07:11.762
And that's all you can tell us,
Your Majesty?

07:11.864 --> 07:13.797
It is exactly
as I have explained.

07:13.799 --> 07:15.833
A sinister humoresque
in mask and tights

07:15.835 --> 07:19.770
some other scoundrels, Batman
and Robin being captured.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.106
It all happened so suddenly,
so swiftly

07:22.108 --> 07:24.808
then I was returned
to my hotel blindfolded.

07:24.810 --> 07:27.811
And you have
no idea where you were at?

07:27.813 --> 07:28.746
None whatsoever.

07:28.748 --> 07:31.882
Alright, Your Majesty,
thanks for your time.

07:33.085 --> 07:35.386
I feel terrible
about Batman and Robin

07:35.388 --> 07:37.655
but I'm due at the
Queen Of Freedom Monument..

07:37.657 --> 07:40.057
- I could cancel that--
- Oh, no, no, Your Majesty.

07:40.059 --> 07:42.326
If we need further information,
we'll contact you.

07:42.328 --> 07:45.062
Thank you, gentlemen.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.873
They're alive!

07:58.378 --> 07:59.844
Batman, are you alright?

08:00.046 --> 08:03.080
Yes, commissioner,
we had a nasty turn

08:03.082 --> 08:05.049
but we came out of it alright.

08:05.051 --> 08:06.050
Have you spoken with King Boris?

08:06.052 --> 08:08.185
Yes, he's perfectly safe.
On his way right now.

08:08.187 --> 08:11.689
for some festivities at the
Queen Of Freedom Monument.

08:11.691 --> 08:12.523
And The Riddler?

08:12.525 --> 08:14.124
He left us
in the clutches of death.

08:14.126 --> 08:16.560
Well, thank the stars
that you managed to escape.

08:16.562 --> 08:20.631
Commissioner, with The Riddler
thinking we're out of the way

08:20.633 --> 08:21.866
he might get a bit careless.

08:21.868 --> 08:25.803
I suggest that you don't tell
anyone that we've contacted you.

08:25.805 --> 08:28.939
O'Hara and I won't tell a soul.

08:28.941 --> 08:30.674
Good, I'll be in touch.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.244
A riddle a day
keeps The Riddler away.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.446
I won't forget
you told me that.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.179
Don't.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.948
Whatever his
evil scheme is

08:37.950 --> 08:40.083
he hasn't hatched it yet.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.385
I wonder what his
next move will be.

08:42.388 --> 08:45.956
Let's get to the Bat-cave
and be ready for it.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.262
'From the
Queen Of Freedom Monument.'

08:52.264 --> 08:56.433
'This station presents a special
public affairs program.'

08:56.435 --> 09:01.238
Yeah, this should prove
very interesting.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.207
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.475
Here we are
at the Museum Of Fame

09:05.477 --> 09:06.610
housed inside the torch room

09:06.612 --> 09:10.147
high atop the inspiring
Queen Of Freedom Monument.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.349
In just a few minutes,
King Boris

09:12.351 --> 09:15.018
will present the museum
with a gift indicative

09:15.020 --> 09:16.286
of his country's appreciation.

09:16.288 --> 09:23.494
A gold, bejeweled, miniature
replica of the Queen Of Freedom.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.130
Here comes the king.

09:29.802 --> 09:32.936
And now His Majesty, King Boris.

09:32.938 --> 09:35.038
Good afternoon, Your Majesty.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.242
It is my great pleasure
and honor to welcome you

09:38.244 --> 09:42.179
on behalf of our fair city,
our nation

09:42.181 --> 09:44.882
and the television audience.

09:49.855 --> 09:53.455
My friends, it is the great
honor for me

09:53.457 --> 09:57.995
to present Gotham City's Museum
Of Fame with this statue.

09:57.997 --> 10:02.166
A symbol of courage and freedom
to all the world.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.168
God bless you.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.805
Thank you, Your Majesty.

10:08.207 --> 10:11.141
On behalf of Gotham City
and our country

10:11.143 --> 10:13.343
permit me to express
our gratitude

10:13.345 --> 10:15.579
and also the hope
that you thoroughly enjoy

10:15.581 --> 10:19.049
the remainder
of your visit here.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.122
So there you have it, folks.

10:25.124 --> 10:28.458
The replica will now go
on permanent display here

10:28.460 --> 10:31.195
along with other famous
memorabilia.

10:31.197 --> 10:35.199
Some of which
you might be able to see.

10:35.868 --> 10:37.501
Uh, over here for instance

10:37.503 --> 10:42.906
we have the original Gotham City
Commodity Exchange building.

10:42.908 --> 10:46.210
And, uh, back here..

10:46.212 --> 10:51.882
I think you can see, a bust
of Gotham City's first mayor.

10:51.884 --> 10:59.189
And of course, how could our
Museum Of Fame exist without

10:59.191 --> 11:01.925
Batman and Robin.

11:08.734 --> 11:09.633
I think they are cute.

11:10.135 --> 11:12.636
Just because we're on opposite
side to the fence doesn't--

11:12.638 --> 11:17.474
We were on opposite side to the
fence. They're dead, remember?

11:19.011 --> 11:19.910
Take that thing off!

11:20.212 --> 11:22.479
'The inspiring..'

11:23.415 --> 11:30.387
Thanks, Kenny. You're the best
partner in crime I ever had.

11:35.261 --> 11:39.197
<i> Later, on a Gotham City</i>
<i> street corner.</i>

12:19.272 --> 12:20.572
Good heavens!

12:20.574 --> 12:22.607
What? What is it?

12:22.609 --> 12:23.508
Alright, listen

12:23.810 --> 12:27.845
"If Gotham City does not pay me
one million dollars in cash

12:27.847 --> 12:31.249
"by 10 o'clock tonight,
the Queen Of Freedom Monument

12:31.251 --> 12:32.450
"will be blown sky high.

12:32.452 --> 12:35.153
"All security of its
cannot stop the destruction

12:35.155 --> 12:37.556
"and only <i> I</i> can deactivate
the bomb.

12:37.558 --> 12:40.592
PS, Batman and Robin..

12:41.194 --> 12:44.829
...are dead.
The Riddler."

12:45.832 --> 12:48.300
That infernal devil.

12:48.302 --> 12:51.870
Oh, so that was his plot.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.239
To get rid of
Batman and Robin

12:54.241 --> 12:58.510
and then pull off
the biggest extortion caper

12:58.512 --> 13:01.513
in the history of Gotham City.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.785
And he might
just get away with it.

13:11.558 --> 13:12.957
So that's his scheme,
commissioner.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.560
And obviously,
the city must pay for it.

13:15.862 --> 13:18.529
But it's almost
4 o'clock now, Batman.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.565
Half the city council
are out of town

13:20.567 --> 13:21.866
They won't meet again
until tomorrow.

13:21.868 --> 13:25.604
I couldn't get that kind of
money if my life depended on it.

13:25.606 --> 13:27.906
Hmm, that is a problem.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.241
Could you get it
from any private source?

13:30.243 --> 13:31.176
I don't know of anyone

13:31.178 --> 13:33.578
that has that kind of money
readily available.

13:33.580 --> 13:37.248
- Except.
- Except who?

13:37.250 --> 13:41.119
Well, except my good friend,
Bruce Wayne

13:41.121 --> 13:42.086
the millionaire socialite.

13:42.088 --> 13:45.223
And by all means, call him,
you can't waste any time.

13:45.225 --> 13:48.893
Alright, I'll contact
you later, Batman.

13:53.867 --> 13:57.335
You understand, Bruce, this
million dollars is just a loan.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.971
I don't know what this is
all about, commissioner.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.907
But if it's in the best interest
of Gotham City

14:02.909 --> 14:04.943
I'm certainly happy to do it.

14:04.945 --> 14:08.346
But you may not get
all the kudos that Batman does.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.180
But believe me, Bruce,

14:09.182 --> 14:11.382
you're the unsung hero
of this dark hour. Thanks.

14:11.384 --> 14:14.452
I just wanna do my duty
as a proud citizen

14:14.454 --> 14:16.387
of this fair community.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.524
Batman!
What the devil!

14:19.526 --> 14:20.525
It's Batman.

14:20.827 --> 14:23.795
Sorry, commissioner, I used
the Bat-rope to get up here

14:23.797 --> 14:26.130
because I didn't
wanna be noticed.

14:26.132 --> 14:28.533
I'm sure The Riddler
has notified you

14:28.535 --> 14:30.068
that Robin and I were dead.

14:30.070 --> 14:30.935
Yes.

14:30.937 --> 14:33.071
Good. I wanted him
to think that.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.072
But, Batman, we discussed--

14:34.074 --> 14:36.808
I never had the pleasure
of meeting Batman, commissioner.

14:36.810 --> 14:40.511
Oh, I-I'm sorry. Batman, this is
my good friend, Bruce Wayne.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.280
Ah, the millionaire socialite.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.416
I've always wanted
to meet you, Mr. Wayne.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.552
The feeling is mutual.

14:49.589 --> 14:50.855
Ah, speaking of millionaires,

14:50.857 --> 14:53.024
did you get the money
for The Riddler?

14:53.026 --> 14:55.927
I've just made the arrangements.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.730
Am I free to speak?

14:58.732 --> 15:02.467
I trust Bruce Wayne
as I trust you, Batman.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.568
Good.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.136
I have a plan.

15:05.138 --> 15:08.006
I suggest no cops.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.808
Police, that is.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.744
9 o'clock,
have your men place the money

15:12.746 --> 15:16.815
'inside the museum, in the torch
room with the monument.'

15:16.817 --> 15:18.783
'Then they must leave.'

15:18.785 --> 15:20.919
Million dollars
is a lot of money.

15:21.121 --> 15:24.022
But The Riddler's
smart and tricky.

15:24.024 --> 15:28.092
If he suspects a trap,
he'll pass up the cash

15:28.094 --> 15:30.461
'and destroy the monument.'

15:30.463 --> 15:32.230
Then how do we catch him?

15:32.232 --> 15:35.233
You leave that to Robin and me.

15:38.004 --> 15:42.573
You have to deactivate the bomb
wherever it is before he leaves.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.276
Then we will jump into action.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.577
'I know nothing whatsoever'

15:46.579 --> 15:48.947
'about this sort of thing,
commissioner.'

15:48.949 --> 15:51.516
But as a layman,
it makes sense to me.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.584
Alright then,
that's the way it'll be.

15:53.586 --> 15:58.222
You're a smart man, Mr. Wayne.
We should get together sometime

15:58.224 --> 16:01.259
and discuss crime prevention.

16:01.261 --> 16:01.960
With pleasure.

16:01.962 --> 16:05.330
I'll look forward to seeing you
in the near future.

16:22.783 --> 16:24.182
Batman!

16:26.620 --> 16:29.854
Take it easy,
you're not seeing a ghost.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.057
That's Whitey.!

16:32.993 --> 16:33.692
How did it go?

16:33.994 --> 16:36.561
Great, uh, Gordon went for it
like a duck to water.

16:36.563 --> 16:40.131
And that millionaire socialite
Bruce Wayne was there also.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.533
Well, he fell so hard
for the act

16:42.535 --> 16:44.936
that he helped
sell our plan to Gordon.

16:44.938 --> 16:47.005
And the coast will be clear.

16:47.007 --> 16:47.438
Clear!

16:47.440 --> 16:52.076
As your gorgeous brown eyes,
my little Mousey.

16:52.913 --> 16:58.016
Oh, I've really
outdone myself this time.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.153
Oh, genius.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.454
Sheer genius.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.638
Robin, Robin, where are you?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.675
'Up here.'

17:23.676 --> 17:25.143
What are you doing up there?

17:25.345 --> 17:27.244
It was making
a funny rumbling noise.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.447
I thought some part
might be loose.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.349
Just checking it out.

17:31.351 --> 17:34.485
Did you, uh, give Commissioner
Gordon the money?

17:34.487 --> 17:38.723
Yes, I also met Batman.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.825
Oh. You what!

17:40.827 --> 17:41.993
Very interesting.

17:42.863 --> 17:44.896
The Bat-phone's ringing.

17:45.932 --> 17:46.798
Yes, commissioner.

17:46.800 --> 17:51.369
By any remote possibility, were
you in my office this afternoon?

17:51.371 --> 17:53.304
'No, why?'

17:53.306 --> 17:54.839
I didn't think so.

17:55.141 --> 17:57.174
But someone
impersonating you was here.

17:57.176 --> 18:00.144
I played along with the hoax
because Bruce Wayne was present.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.212
I didn't wanted to expose him
to any danger.

18:02.214 --> 18:05.583
Good for you. You did exactly
as you should have done.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.352
Did he give you
any instructions?

18:08.354 --> 18:10.288
Fine. You do just what he says.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.391
In the meantime,
I'll map out a plan.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.159
What was it?

18:15.361 --> 18:16.227
As I was telling you

18:16.229 --> 18:18.796
The Riddler had someone
impersonate me today.

18:18.798 --> 18:22.267
I knew he'd get careless if he
thought we were out of the way.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.134
But how do we stop him?

18:23.236 --> 18:26.170
The clinch here would be
to solve this last riddle.

18:26.172 --> 18:29.974
"Why is a woman
in love like a welder?"

18:30.576 --> 18:33.944
I bet that'll tell us the
location of the bomb alright.

18:33.946 --> 18:38.115
Well, stop fiddling with that
atomic pile and come down here.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.518
Two heads are better
than one, old chum.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.687
Okay, I can't fix it anyway.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.189
Not without a torch.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.459
Great Scott!

18:49.162 --> 18:52.463
- A torch. That's it.
- Huh?

18:52.465 --> 18:56.234
"Why is a woman
in love like a welder?"

18:56.236 --> 18:59.704
Because they both
carry a torch.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.305
Holy conflagration!

19:01.307 --> 19:03.274
The torch room
at the Queen Of Freedom.

19:03.276 --> 19:06.511
But how could
The Riddler place a bomb there?

19:06.513 --> 19:08.779
He didn't, King Boris did.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.348
What? King Boris?

19:10.350 --> 19:12.583
I'll explain on the way.

19:23.196 --> 19:26.898
<i> Darkness flows</i>
<i> over Gotham City.</i>

19:26.900 --> 19:27.932
<i> But on a shadowy balcony,</i>

19:27.934 --> 19:33.871
<i> in the torch room of the</i>
<i> Queen Of Freedom Monument..</i>

19:33.873 --> 19:35.806
How does it look?

19:36.209 --> 19:37.608
Two policemen came earlier

19:37.610 --> 19:40.211
they placed the black bag
down there.

19:40.213 --> 19:40.912
Then left.

19:40.914 --> 19:44.883
Good, good. Perfect, perfect!
That's the landing. Wonderful.

19:44.885 --> 19:49.220
My friends, plan 136-triple A
is about to begin.

19:49.222 --> 19:52.123
Mousey, you stay her
and be the lookout.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.658
Good luck.

19:54.728 --> 19:56.194
Onward.

20:06.439 --> 20:11.042
Beautiful, beautiful.
Beautiful!

20:11.911 --> 20:14.378
- Can we see the dough?
- Not now, you dope.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.946
I have to deactivate
the bomb first.

20:15.948 --> 20:19.350
Or do you want to be blown
to smithereens?

20:19.352 --> 20:21.352
Now just..

20:22.022 --> 20:24.489
The replica. It's gone.

20:25.558 --> 20:29.560
What squeals louder
than a cotton rat?

20:29.562 --> 20:33.331
Answer, several cotton rat.

20:35.101 --> 20:38.069
I've been out-riddled.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.371
But the dough.

20:48.248 --> 20:51.282
They fooled me
with my own trick.

20:51.484 --> 20:54.452
That's the only way
we can smoke you out.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.087
What?

20:57.557 --> 20:59.523
Is this what
you're looking for, Riddler?

20:59.525 --> 21:00.591
'Clever of you to place'

21:00.593 --> 21:03.027
'a time bomb inside it
when you kidnapped King Boris.'

21:03.229 --> 21:06.096
Knowing he was gonna present
it here the following day.

21:06.098 --> 21:11.068
Poor fellow was nothing
but an innocent stooge.

21:11.070 --> 21:13.171
But you're dead, Batman.

21:13.173 --> 21:14.372
Not quite!

21:14.374 --> 21:18.242
We foiled
your villainous death plot.

21:19.312 --> 21:22.747
The bomb,
it'll go up any second.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.415
Don't worry.

21:25.351 --> 21:27.418
I deactivated it.

21:27.420 --> 21:30.588
Now we're going
to deactivate you.

21:30.790 --> 21:34.492
There are four of us
against the two of you.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.794
But we're not afraid.

22:12.299 --> 22:13.598
Ha!

22:39.292 --> 22:41.525
I'll never understand
why girls like you

22:41.527 --> 22:44.162
get involved
in things like this.

22:44.164 --> 22:45.195
Kicks, I guess.

22:45.397 --> 22:47.898
I've been looking for them
ever since I dropped

22:47.900 --> 22:49.867
out of high school.

22:52.005 --> 22:56.941
But I'm sort of glad
they didn't do you in.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.177
Thank you.

23:05.118 --> 23:05.817
Uh!

23:05.919 --> 23:09.620
Time to go, Riddler... to jail.

23:22.269 --> 23:26.438
There's just nothing
like a good cup of tea.

23:26.440 --> 23:28.140
Well, I'm off.

23:28.642 --> 23:29.841
Where you going Aunt Harriet?

23:29.843 --> 23:31.810
Oh, I have some
out of town friends

23:31.812 --> 23:33.845
who are visiting
Gotham City for the day.

23:33.847 --> 23:39.084
I thought I'd take them to see
the Queen Of Freedom Monument.

23:39.086 --> 23:41.787
Say, would you like
to join us?

23:41.789 --> 23:42.854
Uh, no, thanks, Aunt Harriet.

23:42.856 --> 23:46.258
I've some Wayne Foundation
business reports to go over.

23:46.260 --> 23:47.659
- Oh.
- Perhaps, Dick.

23:47.661 --> 23:50.429
No! I've got my algebra.

23:50.898 --> 23:53.598
Well, alright,
but you're missing a treat.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.501
It's a very interesting place,
you know.

23:56.503 --> 23:57.569
I'm sure it is, Aunt Harriet.

23:57.571 --> 24:01.039
Probably more interesting
than you could imagine.

24:13.654 --> 24:15.554
The algebra.

24:15.556 --> 24:16.922
Ah!
