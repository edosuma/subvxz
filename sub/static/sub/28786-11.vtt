WEBVTT

00:12.827 --> 00:14.689
- Wow, these tomatoes
look plump.

00:14.758 --> 00:16.862
Supple, even.
- Why, thank you.

00:16.931 --> 00:18.379
You off work?

00:18.448 --> 00:20.413
- Yeah, I was hoping
to go in with Kelsey.

00:20.482 --> 00:22.310
You know, help soften
the blow over demotion,

00:22.379 --> 00:24.206
but she hasn't replied
to my many, many texts.

00:24.275 --> 00:25.517
- Give her time.

00:25.586 --> 00:26.689
Hey, you know, you should
stop by

00:26.758 --> 00:27.931
Josh's new space.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.724
It's in Midtown,
right near your office.

00:29.793 --> 00:31.241
- Yeah, I can't do that.

00:31.310 --> 00:34.241
I need to keep our interactions
to a minimum.

00:34.310 --> 00:35.793
I told Charles
I wouldn't see him anymore.

00:35.862 --> 00:38.241
- Oh. Chaz gave you
an ultimatum?

00:38.310 --> 00:39.275
He's full of surprises.

00:39.344 --> 00:40.482
- No, not exactly.

00:40.551 --> 00:41.758
It was my decision.

00:41.827 --> 00:43.000
- That's rigid.

00:43.068 --> 00:45.344
I mean, I'm friends
with all my exes.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.827
Well, except hangnail Helen

00:47.896 --> 00:51.413
and Libby, who had the frog
tank next to her bed.

00:51.482 --> 00:53.068
- Josh is more than my ex.

00:53.137 --> 00:54.310
And as much as I've tried,

00:54.379 --> 00:55.931
we are not really
friends either.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.413
Every time I'm around him,
I get these feelings

00:58.482 --> 01:00.206
that I don't want to be
feeling,

01:00.275 --> 01:01.793
and I don't trust myself.

01:01.862 --> 01:04.310
- That's called undeniable
chemistry.

01:05.172 --> 01:07.034
- Something like that.

01:07.103 --> 01:08.448
Anyway, I've made my choice.

01:08.517 --> 01:10.482
And it's Charles.

01:10.551 --> 01:12.482
We're peers.
He's age-appropriate.

01:12.551 --> 01:14.620
And it's--it feels right.

01:14.689 --> 01:16.793
- You trying to convince me
or convince yourself?

01:16.862 --> 01:17.793
- I am convinced!

01:17.862 --> 01:19.758
I want this relationship
to work.

01:19.827 --> 01:21.724
So the best thing for me
and for Josh

01:21.793 --> 01:24.172
is to just have a clean break.

01:24.241 --> 01:25.965
- So Josh is your sucker.

01:26.034 --> 01:27.068
- Excuse me?

01:27.137 --> 01:28.517
- Tomatoes have these sprouts.

01:28.586 --> 01:29.620
They're called suckers.

01:29.689 --> 01:31.448
See? They're cute, right?

01:31.517 --> 01:33.517
But they suck all the water
out of the main stem,

01:33.586 --> 01:36.034
and they distract the plant
from making healthy fruit.

01:36.103 --> 01:38.724
So, you just pinch 'em off.

01:39.758 --> 01:41.724
How're you gonna do that
to Josh?

01:44.551 --> 01:46.862
- I don't know.

01:46.931 --> 01:48.482
I just know I have to.

01:50.482 --> 01:52.551
- ♪ Heart, eyes, overload ♪

01:52.620 --> 01:54.724
♪ It's irresistible ♪

01:54.793 --> 01:57.103
♪ I'm so stoked on you,
okay ♪

01:57.172 --> 01:58.517
- Oh, don't forget,

01:58.586 --> 01:59.862
your bridal makeup rehearsal
is tonight.

01:59.931 --> 02:01.379
- Yes, I can read a calendar,
Liza.

02:01.448 --> 02:02.827
Just can't sync it
with my phone.

02:02.896 --> 02:04.241
- Oh, and the caterer offered
Friday night

02:04.310 --> 02:05.275
for cake-tasting.

02:05.344 --> 02:06.379
- Friday?

02:06.448 --> 02:07.965
I was leaving that open for...

02:09.827 --> 02:12.689
A night of merriment
and libations.

02:14.896 --> 02:16.103
Ladies only.

02:16.172 --> 02:17.551
- Oh, a bachelorette party?

02:17.620 --> 02:19.655
Oh, I didn't think
you'd want one.

02:19.724 --> 02:21.862
- Yes, that--that's why you're
my maid of honor.

02:21.931 --> 02:22.793
You get me.

02:22.862 --> 02:23.931
I was--I was bringing it up

02:24.000 --> 02:25.275
'cause I don't want one.

02:25.344 --> 02:26.724
- Has anyone heard
from Kelsey?

02:26.793 --> 02:28.172
- No. Uh, I prepared
a press release

02:28.241 --> 02:30.482
for the musical chairs
that is our publisher.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.793
- Oh, and we need
to tell the staff first.

02:32.862 --> 02:35.620
- I'd like to hear how Kelsey
would prefer to handle it.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.931
- It's almost 10:00.
I don't think she's coming in.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.275
- That's understandable.

02:39.344 --> 02:40.793
She's probably suffering
from the bends.

02:40.862 --> 02:44.034
She rose too fast, and all
the pressure, it just...

02:47.206 --> 02:49.344
- You can leave it
in this office right here.

02:49.413 --> 02:51.965
- Are you... okay?

02:52.034 --> 02:52.965
- Yes.

02:53.034 --> 02:54.241
It was my decision

02:54.310 --> 02:55.379
to accept the Chicago
investment

02:55.448 --> 02:57.034
on their terms, remember?

02:57.103 --> 02:59.034
- Yes, but moving out of that
office isn't necessary.

02:59.103 --> 03:01.586
Wait until we've decided how
to notify the company.

03:01.655 --> 03:03.137
No one knows yet.

03:03.206 --> 03:04.931
- Let's take care of that.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.344
Morning, all.

03:07.862 --> 03:08.793
Well, good news.

03:08.862 --> 03:10.965
We have found an angel investor

03:11.034 --> 03:12.344
to replace Quinn,

03:12.413 --> 03:13.862
so operations will resume.

03:13.931 --> 03:15.620
That includes the reinstatement

03:15.689 --> 03:16.965
of Charles Brooks as publisher,

03:17.034 --> 03:19.137
and I will be back
editing with Liza.

03:25.586 --> 03:27.241
- Kept her head after all.

03:27.310 --> 03:28.793
Impressive.

03:32.482 --> 03:33.931
- Are you okay?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.827
-  I'm fine.

03:35.896 --> 03:37.137
Really, I'm fine.

03:37.206 --> 03:39.758
This is his family's company.
This is his office.

03:39.827 --> 03:41.241
I was just...

03:41.310 --> 03:42.448
keeping the seat warm.

03:42.517 --> 03:43.862
- You did much more than that.

03:43.931 --> 03:45.068
You made Millennial.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.172
The imprint you built

03:46.241 --> 03:47.482
kept this company afloat.

03:47.551 --> 03:48.655
- Brava, Kels.

03:48.724 --> 03:50.689
Exactly how I would've done it.

03:50.758 --> 03:53.620
And if it's any consolation,

03:53.689 --> 03:56.965
I thought your social media
faux pas was tasteful.

03:57.034 --> 03:59.827
You know, for you.

03:59.896 --> 04:02.413
Or someone like you--
- We have a meeting.

04:02.482 --> 04:04.310
It's a manners guide
for millennials.

04:04.379 --> 04:05.517
It's sort of an updated version

04:05.586 --> 04:06.931
of Emily Post's
etiquette books.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.965
- Does it include needlepoint
patterns too?

04:09.034 --> 04:11.344
- Ooh, gosh, I hope so.
You want to join?

04:11.413 --> 04:13.413
- Oh, not to be impolite,
but...

04:13.482 --> 04:15.482
I have a lot to do
to finish up in here.

04:15.551 --> 04:17.034
- Of course, of course.

04:17.103 --> 04:19.448
And we have tons of other
projects to consider.

04:19.517 --> 04:22.724
Oodles.
- Stop suffocating her.

04:24.758 --> 04:26.344
- I wrote "Uncommon Courtesy"

04:26.413 --> 04:28.965
to help my generation learn
acceptable social behavior,

04:29.034 --> 04:31.448
because right now,
we're deplorable.

04:31.517 --> 04:33.137
I am not proud to be
a millennial.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.758
- Neither was I.

04:34.827 --> 04:36.517
- Since we share so much of our
private lives online

04:36.586 --> 04:38.586
and see much more than we need,

04:38.655 --> 04:40.379
there are no boundaries.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.137
- Yeah, one of our co-workers
is learning that the hard way.

04:42.206 --> 04:45.172
- Yes, the blurred lines
between work and play.

04:45.241 --> 04:48.448
Do we need to see our colleague
partying in Ibiza?

04:48.517 --> 04:49.758
- We do not.
- Because it does make us

04:49.827 --> 04:51.034
look at them differently.

04:51.103 --> 04:53.000
And then what's proper
etiquette?

04:53.068 --> 04:56.137
"Like" their post?
Comment on their summer body?

04:56.206 --> 04:57.379
- God, no.

04:57.448 --> 04:58.827
- Well, some affirmation
is polite.

04:58.896 --> 05:00.206
Right? I mean,
what's the alternative?

05:00.275 --> 05:01.275
Stop following?

05:01.344 --> 05:02.551
- Definitely an option.

05:02.620 --> 05:03.965
- But couldn't that send
another message,

05:04.034 --> 05:05.862
like you don't approve
of their lifestyle

05:05.931 --> 05:07.655
or you don't want to be friends
with them outside of work?

05:07.724 --> 05:09.413
- It could.

05:09.482 --> 05:12.206
- Everything is so fluid and
ambiguous with this generation.

05:12.275 --> 05:14.206
- Which is why manners
are imperative.

05:14.275 --> 05:16.758
Millennials are
commitment-phobic.

05:16.827 --> 05:19.793
Not only when making plans,
RSVP'ing to weddings...

05:19.862 --> 05:21.034
- Ugh. Don't get me started.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.310
- But when dating.

05:22.379 --> 05:25.275
We struggle to define
our relationships.

05:25.344 --> 05:27.241
And when we no longer want
to engage with someone--

05:27.310 --> 05:29.482
a bad hook-up or an ex--

05:29.551 --> 05:30.896
we ghost them.

05:30.965 --> 05:33.034
Now, this behavior is not only
impolite,

05:33.103 --> 05:34.241
it is damaging.

05:34.310 --> 05:36.413
My book aims to right
these wrongs.

05:36.482 --> 05:40.551
- So, how do you politely
disengage from an ex?

05:40.620 --> 05:42.689
Hypothetically speaking.

05:42.758 --> 05:45.517
- Uh, with matters of
the heart, be clear and direct.

05:45.586 --> 05:47.517
Like writing them
a "Dear John" letter.

05:47.586 --> 05:49.241
- Isn't that a little
old-fashioned?

05:49.310 --> 05:52.068
I mean, do millennials even
know how to hold pens?

05:52.137 --> 05:54.310
- With careful words
and quality paper,

05:54.379 --> 05:57.275
any message,
however important or painful,

05:57.344 --> 05:58.862
doesn't hurt as much.

05:58.931 --> 06:00.413
- Hm.

06:00.482 --> 06:05.137
- Alice, let's just circle back
to the wedding RSVPs, shall we?

06:05.206 --> 06:08.551
- ♪ It's gonna be
a wild ride ♪

06:08.620 --> 06:10.379
♪ Such a free... ♪

06:10.448 --> 06:12.448
- Hey. You okay?

06:12.517 --> 06:15.586
- I've been getting asked
that question a lot today.

06:15.655 --> 06:17.413
Do I not look okay?

06:17.482 --> 06:18.827
- Oh, come on.
You know what I mean.

06:18.896 --> 06:20.655
We haven't talked
since Chicago.

06:20.724 --> 06:22.896
- What's there to say?
- That I'm sorry.

06:22.965 --> 06:25.413
I feel partly responsible
for what happened.

06:25.482 --> 06:27.448
- I posted the video.

06:27.517 --> 06:28.586
Not you.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.482
- Yeah, but it was to me.

06:30.551 --> 06:31.586
Right?

06:31.655 --> 06:33.655
- Obviously.

06:33.724 --> 06:36.896
Look, if I can't run
a social media account,

06:36.965 --> 06:38.793
maybe I shouldn't be
running a company.

06:38.862 --> 06:41.448
- Oh, come on.
You're a great publisher.

06:41.517 --> 06:44.275
And one day when you really
do have your own company,

06:44.344 --> 06:45.655
I mean...

06:49.275 --> 06:50.620
What?

06:50.689 --> 06:53.344
- I don't know how to do this
with you.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.241
Whenever we try,

06:55.310 --> 06:57.896
one of us loses.

06:57.965 --> 07:00.068
It's like we're cursed.

07:07.379 --> 07:09.827
- How do you feel about
me being back as publisher?

07:09.896 --> 07:12.241
- I just wish Kelsey
hadn't been unceremoniously

07:12.310 --> 07:13.931
stripped of the title.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.655
- She seems to be
handling it well.

07:16.724 --> 07:18.827
- She seems to be.
- How about you?

07:18.896 --> 07:21.793
Always thinking of others.
How do you feel?

07:21.862 --> 07:23.137
- I'm not sure.

07:23.206 --> 07:24.965
There's been so many
sea changes around here,

07:25.034 --> 07:26.689
I'm still trying
to find my footing.

07:26.758 --> 07:28.344
-  Me too.

07:31.103 --> 07:32.068
Ah, Diana.

07:32.137 --> 07:34.241
Uh, flowers aren't necessary.

07:34.310 --> 07:35.827
- They're not for you.

07:35.896 --> 07:37.482
They're from Alice Dwyer.

07:37.551 --> 07:38.586
Says on the envelope.

07:38.655 --> 07:41.275
- We got "Uncommon Courtesy."

07:41.344 --> 07:43.758
"Dear Liza and Diana,
deepest appreciation

07:43.827 --> 07:45.241
"for meeting me today.

07:45.310 --> 07:47.000
I want you to know that
you're such wise women."

07:47.068 --> 07:49.310
- Oh, my faith in this
country's youth--

07:49.379 --> 07:51.758
actual youth, Liza--
is restored.

07:51.827 --> 07:53.448
- "However, I'm going with
another publisher

07:53.517 --> 07:55.655
and wanted to notify you
as soon as possible."

07:57.379 --> 07:58.965
- Well, the flowers
are a nice touch.

07:59.034 --> 08:01.034
- Well, Alice is right.

08:01.103 --> 08:02.586
A "Dear John" letter
is more polite

08:02.655 --> 08:04.103
than not hearing
from her again.

08:04.172 --> 08:06.172
Good manners never get old.

08:06.241 --> 08:07.655
I'm taking these.

08:30.758 --> 08:32.068
- Dear Josh,

08:32.137 --> 08:33.413
I can't begin to thank you

08:33.482 --> 08:35.931
for how you've changed
my life.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.827
And picturing you not in it
breaks my heart.

08:44.931 --> 08:47.172
But I need to let you go...

08:55.517 --> 08:57.206
- This is unacceptable.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.965
You just cut the shining star
from your cis male shit show.

09:00.034 --> 09:01.551
I don't even know where
Dubuque is!

09:01.620 --> 09:02.620
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:02.689 --> 09:03.862
What is going on in Dubuque?

09:03.931 --> 09:05.724
- Not Kelsey.
She's cancelled.

09:05.793 --> 09:08.620
Four publishing events
have uninvited her this week.

09:08.689 --> 09:10.758
They don't deserve her!

09:15.689 --> 09:16.862
It's not all bad.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.137
She's getting a cult following.

09:18.206 --> 09:19.448
Roxane Gay is tweeting
about her.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.068
I... I can spin this.

09:21.137 --> 09:22.758
Yes, we'll be fine.
Eventually.

09:22.827 --> 09:24.172
I'm gonna go tell her that
in person.

09:24.241 --> 09:27.172
- Hey, uh, you--
you want to hop into my Uber?

09:27.241 --> 09:29.068
I'm heading into the city
to keep working on

09:29.137 --> 09:31.689
"Infinitely 21 presents
Inkburg Midtown."

09:31.758 --> 09:34.965
- Uber? Midtown?
Yas, corporate zad.

09:35.034 --> 09:36.482
- More like corporate sellout.

09:36.551 --> 09:38.068
- No, no, no, don't think of it
as selling out, okay?

09:38.137 --> 09:39.724
Think of it
as growing up.

09:39.793 --> 09:41.517
- I'm just so relieved
that Clare doesn't have to move

09:41.586 --> 09:43.413
to LA now, honestly.

09:43.482 --> 09:44.655
I mean, with this extra cash,

09:44.724 --> 09:47.137
I get to actually
watch Gemma grow up.

09:47.206 --> 09:48.793
- Aw, yeah. I mean,
Clare's oat milk skin

09:48.862 --> 09:51.000
was never gonna handle
that year-round sun, honey.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.310
Okay, let's roll.
Wait, wait.

09:52.379 --> 09:54.965
Uh, there was some mail
for you.

09:57.241 --> 09:58.448
Here you go.

09:58.517 --> 10:00.551
- Oh, the Uber guy's here.

10:02.724 --> 10:05.413
- Okay, so the Publisher's
Roundtable don't want--

10:05.482 --> 10:07.034
sorry, need you,

10:07.103 --> 10:09.827
and neither do the Young
Presidents' Club in Phoenix.

10:09.896 --> 10:11.586
But on a more positive note--

10:11.655 --> 10:13.413
- My schedule is wide open?

10:13.482 --> 10:15.068
- Yes! Yes, exactly!

10:15.137 --> 10:17.034
And, uh, you have been asked

10:17.103 --> 10:18.931
to present to an all-female
committee

10:19.000 --> 10:22.655
featuring the next generation's
greatest minds and influencers.

10:22.724 --> 10:24.965
- Huh. Uh, what committee?

10:25.034 --> 10:27.655
- The, uh--
the Young Women's Charter...

10:27.724 --> 10:28.896
School.

10:28.965 --> 10:31.379
- School?
- High school, yeah.

10:31.448 --> 10:33.448
- Okay, nice try.

10:33.517 --> 10:34.724
Why did they ask me?

10:34.793 --> 10:37.413
- Because, dude,
you are a digital SHero.

10:37.482 --> 10:39.241
That is hero with an S.

10:39.310 --> 10:41.241
Yeah, they want you to speak
on the dangers of social media.

10:41.310 --> 10:44.103
How you leaned in,
right into the lens,

10:44.172 --> 10:46.482
and now you may suffer
permanent repercussions.

10:46.551 --> 10:48.103
- I am not a victim.

10:48.172 --> 10:49.310
- No, no, no.

10:49.379 --> 10:50.620
But you are an example

10:50.689 --> 10:52.172
of a woman who made a very
simple mistake,

10:52.241 --> 10:53.620
and the patriarchy's seizing
that opportunity

10:53.689 --> 10:55.241
to tear you down, okay?

10:55.310 --> 10:57.551
I don't understand how you're
totally okay

10:57.620 --> 10:58.965
with all the sexist crap.

10:59.034 --> 11:02.448
- I don't want to be
an example or a SHero, okay?

11:02.517 --> 11:04.758
I want to distance myself
from the situation.

11:04.827 --> 11:05.965
Tell them no.

11:07.586 --> 11:08.758
I'm not doing it.

11:14.551 --> 11:15.931
- Bronwyn Madigan.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.586
Travis Jason.

11:17.655 --> 11:19.310
Gloria Rivera.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.931
A confident slate
of established writers

11:22.000 --> 11:23.862
and bold new voices.

11:23.931 --> 11:28.137
Many of these are a credit to
Kelsey's impeccable instincts.

11:28.206 --> 11:29.827
- And Liza's.
- Not my moment.

11:29.896 --> 11:32.931
- So thank you all for your
patience and your hard work

11:33.000 --> 11:35.793
during this, uh, sea change.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.655
Which brings us to this.

11:38.724 --> 11:42.137
- Wha--I thought I passed
on the seafaring book.

11:42.206 --> 11:44.862
- You did, but we think we
should, uh, turn the tide.

11:44.931 --> 11:46.793
-  Good one, Charles.

11:46.862 --> 11:48.482
- We?

11:48.551 --> 11:50.586
-  Unbelievable.

11:50.655 --> 11:52.103
Is this how it's gonna be?

11:52.172 --> 11:54.931
Just watching all of my
decisions be reversed?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.310
- Well, each publisher
has their own instincts.

11:57.379 --> 12:01.517
- And apparently mine weren't
so impeccable after all.

12:01.586 --> 12:02.655
Got it.

12:02.724 --> 12:04.068
- We have several other titles

12:04.137 --> 12:06.655
that fell through the cracks
of Kelsey's desk.

12:06.724 --> 12:08.103
- Fell through the cracks?

12:08.172 --> 12:09.689
- Didn't have time for.

12:09.758 --> 12:13.655
- We have a satirical
reimagining of Apollo 11.

12:13.724 --> 12:15.275
An exposé on Deflategate.

12:15.344 --> 12:16.827
- Who cares?
- Kels.

12:16.896 --> 12:18.448
- Charles does.
And he's in charge.

12:18.517 --> 12:20.413
- Charles in charge.

12:20.482 --> 12:22.551
- Oh, you're enjoying this,
aren't you?

12:22.620 --> 12:24.068
I get knocked down a peg,

12:24.137 --> 12:25.551
and your list expands,

12:25.620 --> 12:27.689
all because I sent you
that stupid video.

12:27.758 --> 12:31.000
- You do blame me.
- Let's not discuss that here.

12:31.068 --> 12:32.448
- Boundaries, Kelsey.

12:32.517 --> 12:34.620
- I agree.

12:34.689 --> 12:36.206
Pay attention, Charles.

12:36.275 --> 12:37.862
And you too, Liza.
- Me?

12:37.931 --> 12:39.965
- Yeah! I didn't have
any boundaries at work.

12:40.034 --> 12:41.379

13:31.862 --> 13:33.241
Legally, I have to.

13:33.310 --> 13:35.379
- I'm thinking here somewhere
here in this, like,

13:35.448 --> 13:37.034
midnight void.

13:37.103 --> 13:42.068
- I think these, uh, they tie
perfectly with our fall line.

13:42.137 --> 13:43.448
- It just--it's--

13:43.517 --> 13:45.275
it's not really
Inkburg's aesthetic.

13:45.344 --> 13:47.931
- And they're the three colors
that ad sales approved.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.068
- Copy.
- So pick one of these.

13:50.137 --> 13:51.931
Totally your choice.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.758
- Citrus zest it is.

13:53.827 --> 13:56.241
- Between you and me,
I don't like these colors,

13:56.310 --> 14:00.275
but I can't officially
dislike them, you know?

14:00.344 --> 14:03.241

your corporate frustrations

Oh, handwritten and stamped.

14:11.793 --> 14:15.000
Where do you even find
a mailbox these days?

14:15.068 --> 14:16.862
- Beats me.
- Okay.

14:16.931 --> 14:18.206

19:16.448 --> 19:19.137
No--other way around.

19:19.206 --> 19:20.379
A goodbye letter.

19:20.448 --> 19:21.862
- What gave you
that stupid idea?

19:21.931 --> 19:24.758
- From the meeting you skipped.
The manners book.

19:24.827 --> 19:27.896
- Oh, God, thinking about being
in that conference room

19:27.965 --> 19:29.068
bums me out.

19:29.137 --> 19:30.275
When am I ever gonna be happy

19:30.344 --> 19:31.413
to be in there again?

19:31.482 --> 19:33.482
Like, what am I supposed to do?

19:33.551 --> 19:36.068
Climb all the way back up?

19:36.137 --> 19:37.137
To where?

19:37.206 --> 19:38.379
- I'm sorry, how did tonight

19:38.448 --> 19:39.724
become all about you?

19:39.793 --> 19:40.931
This is my night!

19:41.000 --> 19:42.379
- It's not a coffee klatch

19:42.448 --> 19:43.724
in the Millennial break room.

19:43.793 --> 19:47.275
I want the full
bachelorette experience.

19:47.344 --> 19:50.068
I want to make mistakes I will
regret for the rest of my life.

19:50.137 --> 19:52.413
- You want regrets, Diva Bride?

19:52.482 --> 19:53.896
I know just the place.

19:53.965 --> 19:55.172
- Okay.
- All right.

19:59.448 --> 20:03.137
- Okay! Here we are!

20:03.206 --> 20:04.586
- Whoo!

20:07.448 --> 20:10.551
- Get out of the hummer van!

20:10.620 --> 20:12.931
- Okay, cheers, diva.
Diva, come on.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.827
Oh, no.

20:16.896 --> 20:17.827
Oh, no-no-no. I...

20:17.896 --> 20:18.965
I can't see Josh.

20:19.034 --> 20:20.172
Did you know we were
coming here?

20:20.241 --> 20:22.344
- I forgot we were in a car.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.137
Hello, sir.
- Hey.

20:30.206 --> 20:31.586
Lauren texted me.
- I did.

20:31.655 --> 20:33.482
- Y'all ladies called me
right before closing time.

20:33.551 --> 20:35.310
- Listen, Diana wants a tattoo.

20:35.379 --> 20:38.689
- John, just something
small, tasteful...

20:38.758 --> 20:40.000
literary.

20:40.068 --> 20:42.068
Something only Enzo can see.

20:42.137 --> 20:43.586
- Oh, I would love to, Diana,

20:43.655 --> 20:45.551
but you're just a little drunk.

20:45.620 --> 20:46.793
- We're not drunk,
they're drunk.

20:46.862 --> 20:48.586
- Um, you're gonna
bleed a lot, so...

20:48.655 --> 20:50.413
- Yeah, I don't want that.
- Yeah, okay.

20:50.482 --> 20:51.758
Okay, no-no-no, Diana.

20:51.827 --> 20:53.655
Let's go to--
let's go to Metropolitan.

20:53.724 --> 20:55.172
Let's do karaoke
at Metropolitan.

20:55.241 --> 20:56.931
- Yes!
- Thank you for nothing, Josh.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.413
-  Be careful.

20:58.482 --> 20:59.517
- We'll be careful.
I love you.

20:59.586 --> 21:01.137
- Hey, bae.
- Hi.

21:01.206 --> 21:02.413
- Hi.

21:03.827 --> 21:04.931
- Seriously?

21:06.482 --> 21:08.517
You're just gonna
write me a letter?

21:08.586 --> 21:10.310
And then never
talk to me again?

21:10.379 --> 21:11.931
That's the plan here?

21:12.000 --> 21:13.896
- Yes.

21:13.965 --> 21:16.000
Because I care about you.
That's the problem.

21:16.068 --> 21:17.793
- I'm calling bullshit.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.413
You convinced me to sign
this lease.

21:21.482 --> 21:24.827
You told me you'd always
be here for me.

21:24.896 --> 21:28.482
That you were gonna be Gemma's
Aunt Liza, right?

21:28.551 --> 21:30.965
Now, what?
Now you're just abandoning me?

21:31.034 --> 21:33.965
- I want to give things
with Charles a shot.

21:34.034 --> 21:36.586
I can't go around riding on
motorcycles with you

21:36.655 --> 21:37.965
and having late-night calls,

21:38.034 --> 21:39.586
and you know this is gonna
hurt me too.

21:39.655 --> 21:41.551
It's gonna kill me
not to see Gemma!

21:41.620 --> 21:43.586
- Then why are you doing it?

21:45.206 --> 21:48.827
- Is Charles that much more
important to you?

21:51.206 --> 21:52.172
Are your feelings for him
stronger

21:52.241 --> 21:54.000
than your feelings for me?

21:54.068 --> 21:55.310
Yeah, look--I get it!

21:55.379 --> 21:56.896
Okay? I do.

21:56.965 --> 21:58.137
You're scared...

21:58.206 --> 21:59.586
of us.

21:59.655 --> 22:01.379
Scared of what we were.

22:01.448 --> 22:04.620
Of what we still are.

22:04.689 --> 22:06.310
So now you're making
the safe choice.

22:06.379 --> 22:08.586
- You know what, you don't know
anything about Charles!

22:08.655 --> 22:10.517
And don't you tell me
what I feel!

22:10.586 --> 22:12.068
- Okay.
- I know that this is hard

22:12.137 --> 22:14.413
to accept, Josh.

22:14.482 --> 22:16.551
But we were a moment in time.

22:17.931 --> 22:22.275
It was amazing,
and I will cherish it.

22:22.344 --> 22:24.413
But the time has passed.

22:24.482 --> 22:25.862
- Then just say it.

22:25.931 --> 22:28.896
Just say it.

22:28.965 --> 22:31.310
Say you love him more
than you love me.

22:31.379 --> 22:32.689
- Is that what
you need to hear?

22:32.758 --> 22:34.206
- Yes.

22:34.275 --> 22:37.896
- Then fine--
I love him more.

22:43.241 --> 22:45.517
- You know, you...

22:45.586 --> 22:48.172
you forget, Liza.

22:48.241 --> 22:50.000
I know you.

22:50.068 --> 22:51.724
I know when you're lying.

22:53.655 --> 22:55.068
Especially to yourself.

22:59.482 --> 23:01.068
You wrote a letter
to the wrong guy.

23:03.413 --> 23:05.137

23:05.206 --> 23:06.482
