Captain Ramart, l'm Captain Kirk.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.034
- My navigator, Tom Nellis.
- Hello.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.909
And our young castaway,
Charlie Evans. His dossier.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.991
Mr Evans.

00:43.160 --> 00:46.436
We've heard a great deal about you.
Welcome aboard.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.194
Wonderful boy, Charlie...

00:54.360 --> 00:58.592
lt's been a pleasure having him aboard.
The things he's learned...

00:58.760 --> 01:04.551
Absolutely. To think he was alone
on that planet, everyone killed...

01:04.720 --> 01:07.154
How many humans like me on this ship?

01:08.720 --> 01:14.511
Like a whole city in space, Charlie.
Over 400 in the crew, Captain?

01:14.680 --> 01:16.716
428 to be exact.

01:16.880 --> 01:21.192
Anything we can do?
Medical supplies, provisions...

01:21.360 --> 01:24.352
Hundreds. All human like me.

01:25.400 --> 01:30.918
- That's exciting. ls that the right word?
- That's perfect. lt's the exact word.

01:32.680 --> 01:35.478
You see? We'd like
to keep Charlie with us,

01:35.640 --> 01:38.996
but with his relatives on Colony V,
and you going that way...

01:39.160 --> 01:43.915
l'd like to see your ship now.
All of it. The people and everything.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.071
You keep interrupting.

01:46.240 --> 01:50.472
- That's considered wrong.
- l'm sorry.

01:50.640 --> 01:54.394
We have a large supply
of entertainment tapes.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.711
No, we have a tight schedule
to make, Captain.

01:57.880 --> 02:01.668
This must be a space first. A transport
ship that doesn't need anything?

02:02.520 --> 02:05.193
- Not even Saurian brandy?
- We're fine.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.238
- Pleasant journey, Captain.
- Thank you.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.156
Yeoman Rand, this is Charles Evans.

02:14.320 --> 02:18.029
Show him to his quarters,
and drop his records to Dr McCoy.

02:18.200 --> 02:21.078
Yes, sir. Come with me, please.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.630
Are you a girl?

02:38.880 --> 02:41.394

Tell me, the ship's supply of food
couldn't have lasted 14 years...

04:17.640 --> 04:22.760
After that, l found other things to eat,
just growing around.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.388
You learned to talk by listening to tapes?

04:25.560 --> 04:30.111
The memory banks still worked.
They talked to me and l talked back.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.953
- You're 4-0.
- Four?

04:34.120 --> 04:37.078

- Yeah.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.829
Why does he call me Mr Evans?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.594
Cos that's your name.

04:55.760 --> 04:59.548
He's not...
He isn't like Captain Ramart.

04:59.720 --> 05:03.235
No, Captain Kirk is one of a kind,
Charlie.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.955
- Do you like me?
- Why not?

05:12.280 --> 05:17.832

The other ship, they didn't like me.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.635
l tried.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.509
l'm trying to make people like me.
l want them to like me.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.274
Most 17-year-olds do.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.031
Come on, let's go.
l'll show you to your quarters.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.349
l'll put the equipment away.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.795
- You have a deal, friend.
- All right.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.236
Hello.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.956
l brought you a present.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.315
Oh, thank you.

06:32.480 --> 06:35.916
l really appreciate it.
But l have to go. l'm on duty.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.038
- Do you like that kind?
- Yes, l...

06:42.480 --> 06:45.472
lt's my favourite.
Where did you get it?

06:45.640 --> 06:47.995
They don't have it in the ship's stores.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.754
lt's a present.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.309
l know, but where did...

06:53.480 --> 06:58.759
- Gee, l'm late. l really have to go.
- Can't you stay and talk a little more?

06:59.800 --> 07:01.836
Look, l'm off duty at 1400.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.788
Why don't you join me
in recreation room 6, deck 3?

07:05.960 --> 07:08.190
You got a deal, friend.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.750
Charlie!

07:14.120 --> 07:17.954
l thought... Don't be angry.
l didn't... l wanted...

07:18.120 --> 07:20.236
Charlie, you...

07:21.280 --> 07:24.590
You just don't go around
slapping girls on the...

07:27.480 --> 07:29.994
lt's OK, but just don't do it again.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.116
Don't be angry.

07:33.280 --> 07:37.558
Look. Why don't you tell Captain Kirk
or Dr McCoy what you did?

07:37.720 --> 07:40.553
They'll explain it to you. OK?

07:40.720 --> 07:43.234
- l will.
- OK.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.990
What reason would he have to lie
if there are Thasians?

07:56.160 --> 07:59.391
That is a very intriguing question.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.876
Scanners show
no disturbances, Captain.

08:03.040 --> 08:06.350
Good. Dr McCoy, Mr Spock is working...

08:06.520 --> 08:08.670
- Status report...
- Thank you.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.991
He's working out
a training program for Charlie.

08:12.160 --> 08:15.197
Earth history, his own background,
that sort of thing.

08:15.360 --> 08:21.276
l'd like you to give him medical
orientation on the problems of...

08:21.440 --> 08:23.510
...adolescence.

08:23.680 --> 08:27.958
Why not a strong father image, like you?
He looks up to you.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.396
The job is yours, Bones.
Flattery will get you nowhere.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.996
Doctor, didn't the boy make
any reference at all to Thasians?

08:35.159 --> 08:39.073
Do you believe the legend
that Thasians still exist on that planet?

08:39.240 --> 08:44.473
Charlie's very existence proves
there must be intelligent life on Thasus.

08:44.640 --> 08:48.599
He could not have survived alone.
The ship's food would have been gone.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.796
He ate fruit, vegetables...

08:50.960 --> 08:54.748
- Probes of Thasus indicate...
- Probes can be wrong.

08:54.920 --> 08:58.276
Are you speaking
scientifically or emotionally?

08:58.440 --> 09:03.230
Gentlemen. The fact is the boy is here
and he's alive and needs our help.

09:04.320 --> 09:08.279
And he needs a guide
and he needs a father image, Jim.

09:08.440 --> 09:13.309
l'll depend on your astute abilities
to supply him with that,

09:13.480 --> 09:14.959
or find him one.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.595
(Uhura sings)

09:34.000 --> 09:37.913
l'm sorry. l did it again, didn't l?

# Oh, on the starship Enterprise

09:56.800 --> 10:02.193

who's in Satan's guise

10:02.360 --> 10:07.229
# Whose devil ears and devil eyes

10:07.400 --> 10:10.790
# Could rip your heart from you

10:10.960 --> 10:16.034
# At first his look could hypnotise

10:16.200 --> 10:20.352
# And then his touch would vaporise

10:20.520 --> 10:27.471
# His alien love could victimise

10:27.640 --> 10:31.189
# And rip your heart from you

10:31.360 --> 10:34.397
# And that's why female astronauts

10:34.560 --> 10:38.314
# Oh, very female astronauts

10:38.480 --> 10:45.238
# Wait terrified and overwrought,
to find what he will do

10:47.120 --> 10:53.434
# Girls in space be wary,
be wary, be wary

10:53.600 --> 10:56.797
# Girls in space be wary

10:57.960 --> 11:03.876
# We know not what he'll do #

11:10.840 --> 11:12.990
One more time.

11:14.280 --> 11:19.229
# From a planet out in space

11:19.400 --> 11:22.676
# There comes a lad not commonplace

11:22.840 --> 11:28.278
# Seeking out his first embrace

11:29.720 --> 11:34.350
# He's saving it for you

11:36.280 --> 11:39.875
# Oh, Charlie's our new darling

11:40.040 --> 11:43.999
# Our darling, our darling

11:44.160 --> 11:47.470
# Charlie's our new darling

11:47.640 --> 11:51.918
# We know not what he'll do #

12:02.120 --> 12:03.314
(Coughs)

12:04.520 --> 12:06.476
Want to see something?

12:15.520 --> 12:18.273
Turn them over.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.954
Well, how did you do that?

12:30.240 --> 12:32.470
l can do a lot of card tricks.

12:32.640 --> 12:35.393
One of the men on the Antares
showed me.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.920
l don't believe it.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.710
On Earth, it's Thanksgiving.

13:21.880 --> 13:25.589
lf the crew has to eat synthetic meatloaf,
l want it to look like turkey.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.716
- Charlie.
- Captain?

13:27.880 --> 13:33.113
l'm supposed to ask you something.
Why shouldn't l... How do l explain it?

13:33.280 --> 13:35.748
Say it right out. That usually works.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.036
ln the corridor l saw...

13:38.200 --> 13:41.272
When Janice... When Yeoman Rand...

13:42.320 --> 13:45.437
l did that to her. She didn't like it.

13:45.600 --> 13:49.912
- She said you'd explain it to me.
- Me? l see. Well, um...

13:51.680 --> 13:57.630
Er... There are things you can do
with a lady, Charlie, that you...

14:00.240 --> 14:06.759
Er... There's no right way to hit a
woman. Man to man is one thing...

14:06.920 --> 14:10.435
But a man and a woman, er... lt's, er...

14:12.600 --> 14:16.673
Er... Well, it's another thing.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.918
- Do you understand?
- l don't know.

14:22.080 --> 14:26.153
- 'Captain Kirk.'
- Excuse me. Kirk here.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.880
'Captain Ramart is on D channel.'

14:29.040 --> 14:31.952
- l'm on my way.
- Can l come?

14:32.120 --> 14:35.078
- l don't think so.
- l won't get in the way.

14:38.840 --> 14:42.310
Antares, we're barely
reading your transmission.

14:42.480 --> 14:46.314
'We are at full output, Enterprise.
l must speak to Captain Kirk.'

14:47.480 --> 14:49.710
Kirk here, Captain Ramart.

14:49.880 --> 14:53.236
'We're barely in range.
l've got to warn...'

14:54.440 --> 14:56.635
- Re-establish contact.
- l can't.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.279
Try.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.591
lt wasn't very well constructed.

15:03.840 --> 15:07.230
Sweep the area of the transmission
with our scanners.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.436
Affirmative, Captain.

15:12.200 --> 15:15.158
Do you think something
happened to the Antares?

15:15.320 --> 15:17.993
l don't know.

15:18.160 --> 15:22.676
- Picking up debris on our scanners.
- What about the Antares?

15:25.680 --> 15:29.559
The debris is what's left of the Antares.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.632
- 'Captain Kirk from ship's galley.'
- Kirk here.

15:43.800 --> 15:47.839
'Sir, l put meatloaf in the ovens.
There's real turkeys in there now.'

15:48.000 --> 15:49.956
Chief, have you...

15:50.120 --> 15:52.076
(Charlie giggles)

15:57.240 --> 16:01.199
'Captain's log, stardate 1535.8.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.990
'UESPA headquarters notified of the
mysterious loss of vessel Antares.'

16:11.200 --> 16:14.158
Your mind is not on the game, Captain.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.350
Check. The Antares?

16:19.200 --> 16:23.478
A survey ship with 20 men aboard, lost.
No reason.

16:23.640 --> 16:28.794
Obviously, Captain Ramart was not
aware of any trouble. l can't figure it.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.838
My own concern is more immediate.
The boy.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.356
l usually follow you, but this time...

16:35.520 --> 16:40.196
He seemed to know what happened
to the Antares before we did.

16:41.240 --> 16:46.075
l'd call that a pretty long reach
for evidence. Come in, Charlie.

16:49.680 --> 16:52.274
And again. Check.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.276
Checkmate.

17:02.360 --> 17:06.319
Your illogical approach to chess
does have its advantages on occasion.

17:06.480 --> 17:09.915
- l prefer to call it inspired.
- As you wish.

17:10.079 --> 17:12.230
At any rate, the game is yours.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.907
You play chess, Charlie?

17:16.079 --> 17:20.392
l watched them play on the Antares.
Can l try it?

17:20.560 --> 17:23.154
l place you in the hands
of our chess master.

17:27.240 --> 17:30.835
The principles of three-dimensional
chess are mathematic.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.355
You put the white here, and the black...

17:33.520 --> 17:36.034
l know what it is. Let's play.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.279
Very well.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.790
That was a mistake, Charlie.

17:59.960 --> 18:01.951
No, it wasn't.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.236
Checkmate.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.119
No, it isn't.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.992
lf you'll excuse me...

18:46.920 --> 18:51.391
Charlie, l was looking for you.
l'd like you to meet Tina Lawton.

18:51.560 --> 18:55.633
- Charlie Evans.
- Hello, Charlie.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.473
You might enjoy meeting
someone your age.

18:58.640 --> 19:02.269
Can l talk to you? Alone.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.556
Charlie, Tina's...

19:05.360 --> 19:09.069
Excuse me, l must
be wanted somewhere.

19:11.120 --> 19:15.671
That was... That was rude.
And completely uncalled for.

19:15.840 --> 19:20.391
- l don't need her. l want to talk to you.
- That's no excuse.

19:20.560 --> 19:24.189
You better learn that right now.
You have to live with people.

19:24.360 --> 19:29.912
- You are not alone anymore.
- But she's not as... She doesn't...

19:30.080 --> 19:34.153
She's not the same. Not like you.

19:37.080 --> 19:40.390
She's just a girl.

19:40.560 --> 19:44.997
You're... You smell like a girl.

19:47.480 --> 19:52.349
All the other girls on the ship,
they look just like Tina.

19:54.920 --> 19:58.117
You're the only one that looks like you.

19:59.480 --> 20:05.112
You can understand, can't you?
You know, about being with somebody.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.918
Wanting to be.

20:10.040 --> 20:15.797
lf l had the whole universe,
l'd give it to you.

20:15.960 --> 20:20.909
When l see you,
l...feel like l'm hungry.

20:22.080 --> 20:26.756
All over. Hungry.

20:26.920 --> 20:29.718
Do you know how that feels?

20:37.960 --> 20:42.192
- What?
- l wasn't sure l should talk to you.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.796
- Charlie's a 17-year-old boy.
- Exactly. And he's...

20:45.960 --> 20:49.191
- l've talked to him about the swat.
- lt's not that.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.949
Captain, l've seen the look before,
and if something isn't done,

20:55.120 --> 20:58.317
sooner or later
l'm going to have to hurt him,

20:58.480 --> 21:02.951
tell him to leave me alone, and that
wouldn't be good for him right now.

21:03.120 --> 21:07.830
You see, l'm his first crush,
his first love and his first...

21:08.000 --> 21:11.879
Yes, Yeoman.
l'll talk to him. l'll look into it.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.110
Thank you, sir.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.389
Come in, Charlie.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.796
Charlie...

21:31.640 --> 21:35.758
Do you know anything
about this chess piece?

21:35.920 --> 21:37.911
Did you notice anything peculiar...

21:39.160 --> 21:42.152
- ...when we were using them?
- No, sir. ls that all?

21:42.320 --> 21:44.276
No, no.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.396
Sit down.

21:50.920 --> 21:55.436
Being 17 is more than how many years
you've lived. lt's a whole other thing.

21:55.600 --> 21:59.593
Dr McCoy could probably explain
the biological conditions.

22:03.240 --> 22:08.758
Let's use a specific.
Yeoman Rand is a woman...

22:08.920 --> 22:13.118
- l won't hit her like that anymore.
- No, there's more to it than that.

22:14.160 --> 22:17.470
Everything l do or say is wrong.

22:17.640 --> 22:22.998
l'm in the way, l don't know the rules.
l learn something, try it, and l'm wrong.

22:23.160 --> 22:24.912
Wait.

22:25.080 --> 22:29.198
l don't know what l am,
or what l'm supposed to be,

22:29.360 --> 22:31.590
or even who.

22:31.760 --> 22:36.470
l don't know why it hurts
so much inside all the time.

22:36.640 --> 22:39.871
You'll live, believe me.

22:40.040 --> 22:41.996
There's nothing wrong with you

22:42.160 --> 22:44.958
that hasn't gone wrong
with every other human male.

22:45.120 --> 22:48.351
When you care for someone,
what do you do?

22:52.320 --> 22:54.470
You go slow.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.791
Be gentle.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.991
lt's not a one-way street.
How you feel and that's all.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.355
lt's how the girl feels, too.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.870
Don't press, Charlie.

23:12.920 --> 23:17.391
lf the girl feels anything
for you at all, you'll know it.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.396
You understand?

23:20.560 --> 23:25.680
You don't think Jan...
You... She could love me.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.796
She's not the girl, Charlie.

23:27.960 --> 23:32.670
The years are wrong, for one thing.
And there are other things.

23:32.840 --> 23:37.436
- She can. She is. lf l was gentle!
- No!

23:37.600 --> 23:42.151
There are a million things you can have,
and a million you can't have.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.869
lt's no fun facing that
but that's the way things are.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.629
Then what am l going to do?

23:50.800 --> 23:55.237
Hang on tight and survive.
Everybody does.

23:55.400 --> 23:59.029
- You don't.
- Everybody, Charlie. Me too.

24:01.040 --> 24:04.749
l'm trying, but l don't know how.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.353
(Beeping)

24:09.680 --> 24:11.636
Kirk here.

24:11.800 --> 24:16.396
'You asked to be notified when we
were to make our course adjustments.'

24:17.920 --> 24:20.309
Ask Mr Spock to see to it.

24:23.280 --> 24:26.272
Charlie, come on with me.

24:39.080 --> 24:43.073
You've got to slap the floor
to absorb the energy. Go ahead.

24:48.680 --> 24:52.150
Like everything else,
it takes practice. Try again.

24:55.800 --> 24:59.713
Good, that's much better.
Now, l'll show you a shoulder roll.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.596
Try that.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.274
- l don't want to do that.
- l can't...

25:09.440 --> 25:12.079
l don't want to do that!

25:12.240 --> 25:16.597
- Lesson is over for today.
- You were going to teach me to fight.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.593
You have to learn
to protect yourself first.

25:19.760 --> 25:25.232
lt's more than just teaching you
how to defend yourself. Charlie?

25:25.400 --> 25:28.710
l want you to learn... Charlie.

25:30.960 --> 25:34.191
Sam, let me borrow you
for a couple of easy throws.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.920
-Right.
- Watch this, Charlie.

25:41.960 --> 25:45.032
lt wasn't so bad, was it?
Now, l'll throw him.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.156
Here we go, Sam.

25:53.120 --> 25:56.192
- That looks hard.
- Come on Charlie, try it.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.830
Atta boy, let's go.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.556
lt wasn't so bad, was it?

26:23.720 --> 26:26.188
- Who laughed?
- Cool off.

26:26.360 --> 26:28.635
Don't laugh at me!

26:50.880 --> 26:54.350
- Charlie?
- He shouldn't have done that.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.715
lt's not nice to laugh at people.

26:56.880 --> 27:00.077
- What happened to him?
- He's gone.

27:03.360 --> 27:06.193
- That's no answer.
- He's gone.

27:06.360 --> 27:11.309
l didn't mean to do that,
he made me do it. He laughed at me.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.794
- 'Bridge.'
- Kirk here.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.269
- Two men from security.
- 'Affirmative.'

27:19.440 --> 27:24.116
- What are you going to do to me?
- l'm confining you to quarters.

27:24.280 --> 27:27.795
l won't let them hurt me.
l'll make them go away, too.

27:27.960 --> 27:30.315
They won't hurt you, Charlie.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.799
They'll take you to your quarters.
Go with them.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.952
No!

27:57.600 --> 27:59.556
Go to your quarters.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.916
He was going to hurt me.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.514
Go, or l'll pick you up and carry you.

28:25.680 --> 28:29.355
- l won't let you.
- That's your choice.

28:39.840 --> 28:43.674
- l won't let them hurt me.
- They won't hurt you.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.796
'Captain Kirk?'

28:53.680 --> 28:55.671
Kirk here.

28:55.840 --> 28:59.150
'All phaser weapons have disappeared.'

28:59.320 --> 29:01.276
'Shall l repeat, Captain?'

29:02.320 --> 29:05.153
No, l heard you.

29:08.440 --> 29:12.558
Have Dr McCoy and Mr Spock
meet me in the briefing room.

29:17.200 --> 29:22.035
Thasians have been referred to as
having the power to transmute objects,

29:22.200 --> 29:24.270
or render them invisible.

29:24.440 --> 29:27.910
lt's regarded as legend,
but it seems Charlie has this power.

29:28.080 --> 29:31.197
Maybe Charlie isn't an earth being,
but a Thasian.

29:31.360 --> 29:34.477
l don't think so.
Unless they are exactly like earthlings.

29:34.640 --> 29:39.270
The development of his fingers and toes
exactly matches man's on Earth.

29:39.440 --> 29:45.197
We have some idea of his power.
l know what l saw in the gymnasium.

29:45.360 --> 29:49.239
Considering a normal adolescent's
effect, the power Charlie has...

29:49.400 --> 29:53.871
He's short-tempered. He needs,
he wants. Nothing happens fast enough.

29:54.040 --> 29:58.318
Probability is, he's responsible
for the destruction of the Antares,

29:58.480 --> 30:01.677
which would indicate
a total disregard for human life.

30:01.840 --> 30:05.310
He doesn't understand what life is.
He's a boy.

30:05.480 --> 30:09.029
What do we do with this boy?
How do we keep him caged up?

30:09.200 --> 30:13.990
lt goes even further than that.
We can't take him to Earth Colony V.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.470
lmagine what he would do
in an open, normal environment.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.510
Talk to him, listen to him.

30:20.680 --> 30:24.992
He's a boy, trying to be an adult. The
adolescent in him is getting in the way.

30:25.160 --> 30:28.596
And with a weapon in him
which could destroy anyone,

30:28.760 --> 30:31.194
anywhere on this ship.

30:33.800 --> 30:38.954
Well, for the moment he's stopped.
You're an authority he respects.

30:39.120 --> 30:44.353
The struggle must remain between you
and him. Should any of us interfere...

30:51.600 --> 30:53.670
You wanted to ask me something?

30:53.840 --> 30:57.913
Are you responsible for what
happened to the Antares, Charlie?

30:58.080 --> 31:01.038
- Why?
- Answer me.

31:02.760 --> 31:09.359
Yes. There was a warped baffle plate
on their shield. l made it go away.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.473
lt would have blown up anyway.

31:14.600 --> 31:18.673
Well, they weren't nice to me.
They wanted to get rid of me.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.233
They don't now.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.356
What about us, Charlie?

31:31.400 --> 31:33.356
l don't know.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.670
We're in the hands of an adolescent.

31:52.600 --> 31:56.354
Lieutenant, raise Colony V.
l want to speak to the governor.

31:56.520 --> 32:00.559
Navigator, lay a course away
from Colony V. Buy me some time.

32:06.760 --> 32:10.230
Spock, get the doctor up here.
How bad is it?

32:10.400 --> 32:12.356
l think it's all right, sir.

32:12.520 --> 32:15.273
There's no reason
for that to cross-circuit.

32:15.440 --> 32:18.273
l checked it over myself,
not 15 minutes ago.

32:18.440 --> 32:22.558
Captain! l can't feed any
course coordinates into the panel.

32:22.720 --> 32:25.393
Helm doesn't respond.

32:27.720 --> 32:30.473
Mr Spock, you getting any readings?

32:30.640 --> 32:35.236
Tiger, tiger burning bright,
in the forest of the night...

32:36.120 --> 32:38.236
- Spock.
- l'm trying...

32:38.400 --> 32:41.790
Saturn's rings around my head,
down a road that's Martian red.

32:43.440 --> 32:46.159
Trying to change course, Captain?

32:46.320 --> 32:50.359
You can't do that. l want to get
to Colony V as soon as we can.

32:54.240 --> 32:59.553
- Release the transmitter.
- You don't need that subspace chatter.

32:59.720 --> 33:04.555
What's going on?
Spock calls me, then goes into poetry.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.676
See to her, Doctor.

33:06.840 --> 33:09.593
Once upon a midnight dreary,
while l pondered, weak and weary.

33:09.760 --> 33:12.672
Very nice, Mr Ears.

33:12.840 --> 33:16.116
l can make him do anything -
whirl around, laugh.

33:18.080 --> 33:22.198
- That's enough, Charlie.
- Don't you think he's funny?

33:22.360 --> 33:24.794
Leave my crew alone.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.752
He'll soon reach a point
where he won't back down.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.672
l know.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.113
Charlie, what's wrong?

34:09.000 --> 34:11.150
l have something for you.

34:21.040 --> 34:24.112
Pink is your favourite, isn't it?

34:26.320 --> 34:29.312
You don't walk into a room
without knocking.

34:30.520 --> 34:33.830
Don't ever lock your door
on me again, Janice. l love you.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.790
l'll lock it when l please.
What is it you want, anyway?

34:43.800 --> 34:45.870
You.

34:55.679 --> 34:59.389
l only want to be nice to you.
l can give you anything.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.989
- Just tell me.
- Get out.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.833
- 'l only want to be nice.'
- 'Get out, Charlie.'

35:05.000 --> 35:08.675
- Spock.
- 'l can't make it any plainer than that.'

35:10.000 --> 35:13.072
- l love you.
- You don't know what that means.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.515
- Then show me.
- No!

35:29.920 --> 35:32.593
Why did she do that?

35:36.440 --> 35:40.911
l loved her. But she wasn't nice at all.

35:43.440 --> 35:46.512
What you did wasn't nice either.

35:46.680 --> 35:52.073
But l still need you, Captain.
The Enterprise isn't like the Antares.

35:52.240 --> 35:54.834
Running the Antares was easy.

35:56.560 --> 35:59.632
You have to be nice.

35:59.800 --> 36:02.439
All right?

36:20.160 --> 36:24.995
- Mr Spock?
- My legs. They're broken.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.273
- Let him go, too.
- Why?

36:30.440 --> 36:32.795
Because l'm telling you to.

36:32.960 --> 36:36.475
Because you need me
to run the ship and l need him.

36:48.720 --> 36:52.793
lf you try to hurt me again,
l'll make a lot of people go away.

36:54.040 --> 36:58.352
And what about Yeoman Janice?
ls she dead, gone, destroyed?

37:00.880 --> 37:02.996
l won't tell you.

37:11.240 --> 37:16.633
Growing up isn't so much.
l'm not a man and l can do anything.

37:17.680 --> 37:19.636
You can't.

37:26.760 --> 37:30.116
l'll activate the force field.
Return to your section.

37:30.280 --> 37:35.752
He had a mean look.
l had to freeze him. l like happy looks.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.951
Aren't you coming in?

38:08.840 --> 38:10.796
That wasn't nice.

38:11.680 --> 38:16.151
You'll be sorry.
You wait, you'll be sorry you did that.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.230
You will.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.559
(Laughter)

38:44.240 --> 38:46.913
No. No laughing!

38:52.160 --> 38:53.229
(Whimpers)

39:04.680 --> 39:08.195
Captain, my instruments show
we're receiving a message.

39:08.360 --> 39:11.591
lt's on subspace frequency 3.
Ship to ship.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.593
l can't hear it, sir.

39:14.760 --> 39:18.309
Are you creating that message
or blocking one?

39:18.480 --> 39:21.597
lt's my game, Captain.
You have to find out.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.797
Like you said,
that's how the game's played.

39:24.960 --> 39:28.839
You can have it now.
lt's locked on course for Colony V again.

39:59.400 --> 40:02.233
l've waited long enough.
l'm going to take him on.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.233
You don't have any special immunity.

40:05.400 --> 40:08.597
Pushed far enough,
he'd send you to oblivion, too.

40:08.760 --> 40:11.399
Out of the question.

40:11.560 --> 40:14.552
Wait a minute. ls Charlie...

40:16.600 --> 40:21.469
Spock, has he done away
with anybody since he took over?

40:21.640 --> 40:24.108
Not so far as we know.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.955
Maybe he can't.

40:28.120 --> 40:33.353
Could be he's overreached himself.
lt's a big ship. He's taken full control.

40:33.520 --> 40:37.911
lf we could tax his power,
turn on every device on the ship,

40:38.080 --> 40:40.389
every circuit, all of it,

40:40.560 --> 40:46.157
while he's fighting that, if l could distract
him, maybe you could tranquillise him.

40:46.320 --> 40:49.995
Keep him under
until we reach Colony V.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.310
Risky, Jim.

40:52.480 --> 40:56.109
lf we don't try, Doctor,
he'll get rid of us anyway.

40:58.480 --> 41:00.550
There's no choice, gentlemen.

41:01.600 --> 41:06.037
l can make you all go away,
anytime l want to.

41:09.560 --> 41:13.758
- Get out of my chair. Now.
- l've got your ship, Captain.

41:18.840 --> 41:22.833
Maybe, but l don't think
you can handle any more.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.670
(Beeping)

41:31.000 --> 41:35.437
You've reached your limit
and can't take on one more thing.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.836
But you're going to have to.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.039
- l didn't send you away before...
- You're going to have to take me on.

41:54.200 --> 41:59.558
- Don't make me do it now.
- You've got my ship and l want it back.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.915
l want my crew back. Whole.

42:03.040 --> 42:06.237
lf l have to break your neck to do it.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.351
Don't push me.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.476
Sorry.

42:18.640 --> 42:21.916
l'm sorry, but...

42:23.320 --> 42:25.709
(Beeping)

42:27.240 --> 42:28.958
Stop that.

42:30.520 --> 42:32.476
l said, stop it!

42:32.640 --> 42:36.633
Captain, navigation console is clear.
Ship is answering the helm.

42:36.800 --> 42:40.998
Something off our starboard bow.
The message says they're from Thasus.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.956
No...

42:48.920 --> 42:51.275
- How did...
- lt's all right, Yeoman.

42:51.440 --> 42:55.797
Sensors show something.
Deflectors indicate nothing.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.074
No!

43:01.520 --> 43:03.476
No, please.

43:04.320 --> 43:08.233
Don't let them take me.
l can't live with them anymore.

43:19.240 --> 43:21.515
My friends.

43:22.520 --> 43:25.239
You said you were
my friends, remember?

43:26.120 --> 43:28.315
When l came aboard.

43:36.240 --> 43:38.196
Please.

43:39.680 --> 43:41.910
l want to go home.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.116
Take me home.

43:51.440 --> 43:57.231
l have taken my form of centuries ago,
so that l may communicate with you.

43:59.280 --> 44:03.831
We did not realise until too late
that the boy had gone.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.949
We are saddened that his escape
cost the lives of the first ship.

44:09.120 --> 44:11.509
We could not help them.

44:11.680 --> 44:16.356
But we have returned your people
and your ship to you.

44:17.400 --> 44:20.119
Everything is as it was.

44:23.760 --> 44:29.869
l won't do it again. Please, l'll be good.
l won't ever do it again.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.869
l'm sorry about the Antares. l'm sorry!

44:41.920 --> 44:45.196
When l came aboard.

44:47.760 --> 44:51.878
Please. l want to go with you.

44:53.640 --> 44:55.596
Help me!

45:09.640 --> 45:13.792
- The boy belongs with his own kind.
- That will be impossible.

45:13.960 --> 45:19.318
We can teach him to live in our society,
if he can be taught not to use his power.

45:19.480 --> 45:22.870
We gave him the power so he could live.

45:23.040 --> 45:29.673
He will use it, always.
And he would destroy you and your kind.

45:29.840 --> 45:33.116
Or you would be forced to destroy him.

45:33.280 --> 45:35.236
ls there nothing you can do?

45:35.400 --> 45:40.394
We offer him life.
And we will take care of him.

45:44.800 --> 45:46.995
Come, Charles.

45:52.320 --> 45:56.871
Oh, please. Don't let them take me.

45:59.040 --> 46:01.918
l can't even touch them.

46:02.080 --> 46:05.993
Janice, they can't feel.

46:07.040 --> 46:09.190
Not like you.

46:10.840 --> 46:13.308
They don't love.

46:14.840 --> 46:19.197
Please. l want to stay.

46:38.280 --> 46:42.990
(Uhura) Charlie's back on board
the Thasian ship, sir.

46:44.280 --> 46:47.317
They signal they're leaving.

46:56.160 --> 47:00.199
lt's all right, Yeoman. lt's all over now.
