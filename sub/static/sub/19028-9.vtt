00:02.877 --> 00:06.426
<i>I'm such a total loser.
My girlfriend and I broke up,</i>

00:06.715 --> 00:09.866
<i>I live in a tent, plus I feel sick enough
to actually get checked out,</i>

00:10.135 --> 00:11.693
<i>and guess who's on call?</i>

00:11.886 --> 00:14.275
- That doesn't look right.
- What? What is it?

00:14.806 --> 00:18.879
You have a penis,
or that's what I think it is.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.827
It's a penis.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.788
Fair enough. Why don't we go ahead
and give you that blood test?

00:24.649 --> 00:26.241
<i>I wasn't the only one suffering.</i>

00:26.443 --> 00:28.877
<i>Turk's intern, Milos,
was driving him nuts.</i>

00:29.112 --> 00:31.421
<i>See, Milos was already
an accomplished surgeon</i>

00:31.656 --> 00:36.207
<i>in his war-torn homeland, but he still
had to re-do his residency here.</i>

00:36.536 --> 00:40.893
Okay, everyone, let's take a look at that
subcuticular stitch on Mr Roth's chest.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.421
That is beautiful.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.981
We could all learn from
whatever attending did that.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.168
It was me.
Would you like to take break?

00:48.381 --> 00:50.770
I finish taking
frightened bunnies on rounds.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.284
No, Milos.
I would not like to take a break.

00:53.511 --> 00:54.990
I'm absolutely fine right here,
thank you.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.374
Okay, fine.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.842
You know what? Everyone head down
to observation and check out

00:59.059 --> 01:00.731
Mr Foley's arm re-attachment.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.652
What, you don't think you can learn
from seeing an actual

01:08.860 --> 01:10.418
arm re-attachment, Milos?

01:10.862 --> 01:16.061
I re-attach child's arm once
in rusty shell of car.

01:17.035 --> 01:21.108
I can still see dead bodies
that littered streets

01:21.414 --> 01:24.804
as my country burnt to ground.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.925
Milos is so lucky.

01:32.133 --> 01:35.205
Turk, you're the only one in the world
who would think that.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.453
- Milos is so lucky.
- That's what I'm sayin'.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.337
Brown Bear, thanks for spending
so much time with me lately.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.153
I just feel like my whole life
is in the crapper.

01:45.438 --> 01:46.871
Oh, man, you'll turn this around.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.676
There goes Buzz and Donna,
off to the marriage counsellor.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.997
Buzz feels inadequate
because he lost his job at Foot Locker.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.514
Now his dingle won't work.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.895
I should not have given you
the spy equipment for your birthday.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.229
Are you kidding me?

02:00.412 --> 02:03.006
I need it so I know when I can
sneak over and use the can.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.887
And by the way,
I'm using the front bathroom now

02:06.126 --> 02:08.481
because it has a hook on the door
so I can hang up my pants.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.925
You finally started listening to me.

02:11.131 --> 02:15.010
You're right, my friend. Man is the only
animal that wears pants during twosies.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.416
It's just so unnatural.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074

02:29.190 --> 02:32.227
Newbie's test results came back.
He's got vasovagal syncope.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.530
- And that makes you happy?
- If he's vigourously valsalving,

02:35.780 --> 02:38.852
he can activate his reflex
and actually lose consciousness.

02:39.659 --> 02:42.093
Carla, he'll pass out when he poops.

02:46.249 --> 02:50.083
Buzz, Donna? How was counselling?

02:51.755 --> 02:53.791
Would one of you mind handing me
my chinos?

02:55.633 --> 02:58.022
Turk, I need help.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.594
Buzz is mad.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.849
Well, I read up on vasovagal syncope.

03:19.074 --> 03:22.066
To treat it,
I have to work on reducing my stress.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.795
At least Buzz agreed
not to call the cops if I don't tell

03:25.038 --> 03:26.835
all the other neighbours
Donna's barren.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.951
Damn, dude, you got it pretty rough.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.158
You hear that, everybody?
I do have it rough,

03:31.378 --> 03:34.734
and that's coming from a man who
knows a teensy bit about adversity.

03:35.006 --> 03:37.156
And why is that, Turk?

03:37.384 --> 03:40.615
- Because I'm black.
- No, because you have diabetes.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.684
What's hard about being black?

03:44.432 --> 03:47.947
Hiya! My name is Bob Kelso
and I like whores.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.330
Now, why don't I introduce
myself like that?

03:52.607 --> 03:55.997
Because there is a time
and a place for the truth.

03:56.277 --> 03:59.030
Now, you take Dorian's intern,
Brendan, for example.

03:59.280 --> 04:03.319
He told his patient that it was the first
time he was performing a spinal tap.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.256
And what did the patient do, Doctor?

04:05.537 --> 04:09.655
Well, she started to hyperventilate,
and then she reached for a hit

04:09.958 --> 04:12.313
of what she thought
was an oxygen tank.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.739
It turned out to be
a helium container from paediatrics.

04:15.505 --> 04:18.702
Then she screams,
"I'll kill you, bitches!"

04:18.966 --> 04:20.958
Which, frankly,
we all thought was hilarious.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.570
Oh, indeed it was.
But you know what wasn't?

04:23.805 --> 04:27.115
When she ran for the door,
tripped and fell and broke her femur.

04:27.851 --> 04:31.526
Now she's suing the hospital,
and since Ted is our lawyer,

04:31.855 --> 04:33.083
what's going to happen?

04:34.941 --> 04:37.739
Girlfriend's gonna get paid.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.185
So, you called this meeting
to say we should lie more?

04:40.905 --> 04:43.100
Sorry there, Bobbo, but I'm gonna
go ahead and tell the truth

04:43.324 --> 04:47.476
whenever I damn well please.
For instance, your tie. It's hideous.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.745
In fact, its only redeeming quality
is to divert attention

04:50.999 --> 04:53.957
from the very visible
outline of your man girdle.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.551
- Too mean.
- Sorry.

05:01.343 --> 05:05.177
Hey, have fun the next couple days.
I'm going on vacation.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.076
And you're taking a mop?

05:07.432 --> 05:09.821
Yeah. It's a custodial cruise.

05:10.060 --> 05:14.212
Pretty cool, huh? Check this out.
It's really a great package

05:14.564 --> 05:17.317
for guys like me. Guests have
the option of cleaning their own rooms.

05:17.942 --> 05:18.977
Where else are you gonna get that?

05:19.444 --> 05:22.595
There's a shuffleboard with little
urinal cakes instead of the discs.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.424
That's funny. No way!
Special appearance

05:25.658 --> 05:28.331
<i>by Pat Harrington,
Schneider from One Day at a Time.</i>

05:29.162 --> 05:30.561
He's gonna be there
signing work boots.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.070
Gonna be any chicks there?

05:32.499 --> 05:35.696
No maids allowed. You know
how janitors feel about maids.

05:36.378 --> 05:37.333
I do now.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.143
Anyway, Todd and Ted are gonna get
20 bucks from me to tape you

05:40.382 --> 05:42.771
to the ceiling of the cafeteria tomorrow,
and I'm telling you this because

05:43.009 --> 05:45.000
I figure you've already zoned out
and have stopped listening to me.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.175
Am I right?

05:46.846 --> 05:48.074
<i>I don't know what the Janitor had said,</i>

05:48.264 --> 05:50.061
<i>but I feel like things are looking up.</i>

05:50.266 --> 05:51.745
<i>He's leaving, plus I have friends</i>

05:51.935 --> 05:54.005
<i>who are more than happy
to be there for me.</i>

05:54.521 --> 05:58.275
Okay, I've been taking care of J.D. all
week. It's now up to one of you guys.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.903
Go ahead, honey.
Use your new "go-to" excuse.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.186
I can't, I have a baby!

06:05.073 --> 06:08.668
Hey, I have responsibilities, too, okay?
I mean, Keith and I are still in the stage

06:08.952 --> 06:10.749
of our relationship where
I don't hate having sex with him,

06:10.954 --> 06:12.023
and I would like to keep that going.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.722
Elliot, I've spent the last 10 years
getting J.D. through break-ups

06:14.958 --> 06:16.027
and emotional spirals.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.165
I had to have sex with him.
You ever have to do that?

06:18.420 --> 06:20.854
Well, I say y'all step outside
and handle this like we used to

06:21.089 --> 06:23.284
- back in my day.
- Muskets?

06:27.679 --> 06:29.397
<i>Bedpan race!</i>

06:30.515 --> 06:32.426
Put your bedpans on, Elliot.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.031
- I thought we were carrying them.
- Put 'em on!

06:36.438 --> 06:39.191
<i>Last one down
gets to take care of J.D.</i>

06:39.566 --> 06:41.477
<i>Ready, go!</i>

06:53.872 --> 06:56.227
This is a hospital. Keep it quiet!

07:08.470 --> 07:09.459
Oh!

07:11.222 --> 07:14.453
- There ain't no rules in bedpan racing.
- Frick!

07:16.644 --> 07:19.283
Totally psyched to be here, buddy.
Let's start talking about your life.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.831
Okay, but first I have to go
to the bathroom. Do me a favour.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.900
Tie this string around your wrist.
If you feel it tug,

07:25.153 --> 07:27.587
that means I'm down.
Run in and check on me.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.891
Oh.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.055
How is Izzy doing?

07:34.954 --> 07:37.468
Wow, look at you,
remembering my daughter's name.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.459
I'm telling you, your short-term memory
is getting better.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.626
Nah, I had the nurses
write some stuff down. See?

07:42.879 --> 07:46.952
Apparently, I like bananas, and whoa,
I'm getting more surgery tomorrow?

07:47.384 --> 07:50.182
You have a small bowel obstruction.
Basically, the shrapnel in your stomach

07:50.428 --> 07:51.986
has caused scar tissue to form.

07:52.389 --> 07:55.699
In Iraq, we preferred to think of
shrapnel as internal body bling.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.296
Well, then bling, bling!

07:58.520 --> 08:02.991
So, have any of your patients
ever died from this procedure?

08:03.316 --> 08:05.784
Yeah, a couple years ago.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.811
A guy had a bad reaction
to anaesthesia,

08:09.322 --> 08:10.357
but that's not gonna happen to you.

08:10.532 --> 08:13.649
You know what? You should
have a nurse write that down.

08:14.786 --> 08:15.741
I like bananas.

08:16.913 --> 08:21.509
You shouldn't have told him the truth,
ooth, ooth, ooth.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.232
- Dr Kelso...
- Ooth.

08:25.422 --> 08:28.016
You can "ooth" all you want,
but I'm not gonna BS Brian.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.567
Look, J.D.,
we all have low moments in our lives.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.885
I mean, in high school, I had
this amazing teacher, Mr Higgins,

08:38.143 --> 08:40.134
and he was funny and inspiring.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.707
I mean, he was like
a second father to me.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.940
And then one day I found out that
he was sleeping with his students,

08:47.235 --> 08:49.305
and I was crushed.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.919
I mean, why not me, you know?
And it wasn't my lazy eye,

08:53.199 --> 08:54.951
because that was fixed by prom.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.194
Anyway, eventually I realised that
your troubles don't seem so bad

08:59.456 --> 09:01.606
if you just stop talking
about them all the time.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.821
You know what else sucks
about my life?

09:05.045 --> 09:07.605
Now even my neighbours
are screwing with my head.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.770
- You called about a wolf?
- A wolf? No.

09:11.301 --> 09:14.532
Someone called 911 on that phone,
claiming there was a wolf in this yard.

09:14.846 --> 09:17.076
This has Buzz written all over it.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.741
He's upset with me,
but he won't talk about it

09:19.976 --> 09:22.092
because his peep won't perform!

09:22.520 --> 09:24.636
He pooped in our house!

09:25.357 --> 09:27.348
I don't know why he can't get past that.

09:31.946 --> 09:35.336
Whoever has the other end
of this string, that's not funny!

09:36.409 --> 09:39.401
Oh, my boobs do look good when
they're wet, though, don't they?

09:39.663 --> 09:41.062
Yeah, they do.

09:42.707 --> 09:46.461
And we'll make
the laparoscopic incision right here.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.890
- Todd, anything to add?
- Your nipples are stunning.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.296
Hey, thanks, brother.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.618
It make Milos sad
that he have to answer to you.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.779
Interns, disperse.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.599
What the hell is "TheToddTime. com"?

10:02.977 --> 10:04.729
Log on and thank me later.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.291
Cyber-five!

10:07.273 --> 10:08.547
- Send.
- Dude!

10:10.652 --> 10:12.768
That guy is such a meathead.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.376
Come on, I thought all you surgeons
were a bunch of brainiacs.

10:15.907 --> 10:17.943
I'm sure you got straight A's
since pre-school, right?

10:18.159 --> 10:19.831
Are you kidding me?

10:20.036 --> 10:22.834
My girlfriend wasn't the only one
with 34 C's,

10:23.081 --> 10:24.753
if you know what I'm saying!

10:26.042 --> 10:29.000
- No.
- Yeah, I was an average student.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.216
- J.D., you should not drive.
- I've only had two Appletinis.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.625
J.D., I know when you're tipsy.
You always get super handsy.

10:42.517 --> 10:46.556
You know what? You're right.
Looks like I'm smugglin' raisins.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.289
I'm close by.
I'll just push my scooter home.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.794
<i>And now for a little radio.</i>

10:55.613 --> 10:58.047
<i>Welcome to Sports Talk.</i>

11:03.413 --> 11:05.085
<i>Ah, much better.</i>

11:07.667 --> 11:11.376
<i>Ah, Billy, after the Arctic and
the Pacific, you're my favourite Ocean.</i>

11:17.761 --> 11:21.720
Dr Kelso, what the hell? Why are you
taking me off of Brian's surgery?

11:22.015 --> 11:24.085
Well, since you told him
you were just an average student,

11:24.309 --> 11:25.742
he doesn't want you to do it any more.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.700
And for extra fun,
guess who I got to replace you?

11:30.398 --> 11:31.513
Hello.

11:31.900 --> 11:36.894
I guess you should have followed
my advice, vice, vice.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.397
I come back. Finish later.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.763
<i>Sir, are you there? We sent an officer.</i>

11:51.002 --> 11:51.957
What?

11:53.838 --> 11:57.626
- There better be a wolf this time.
- Oh, I'm not the person who called.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.952
- Wait, have you been drinking?
- A little, all right.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.621
- But I wasn't driving.
- There's a key in your ignition.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.683
In this state, that's drinking and driving.

12:09.896 --> 12:13.411
Officer, we both know
you're not gonna haul me in for that.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.014
So, how was prison?
Were you scared?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.964
Actually, my cellmates
were a little scared of me.

12:29.624 --> 12:32.855
- That's hardcore, man.
- Why'd he hang up his pants?

12:35.255 --> 12:36.688
After I became a member of the gang,

12:36.881 --> 12:38.951
I even got to help
initiate new members.

12:39.175 --> 12:43.726
- Kick him!
- You like that, you punk-ass bitch?

12:44.055 --> 12:45.090
Take it!

12:45.849 --> 12:47.521
I wonder if we'll stay in touch.

12:50.979 --> 12:54.938
Turkleton, feel free to stop by
Brian's surgery and check out

12:55.233 --> 12:57.827
Dr Radovichovniciviszik's
operating skills.

12:58.361 --> 13:01.398
Unlike you, he understands
the importance of good grades.

13:01.823 --> 13:05.338
Look, Carla, eventually it'll get out,
so I'm just gonna tell everyone

13:05.618 --> 13:06.812
I got an S.U.I.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.353
"Scooting under the influence"?
Are you crazy?

13:09.581 --> 13:11.856
- Keep that to yourself.
- Shush.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.859
May I have everyone's
attention please?

13:15.086 --> 13:16.758
<i>The reason Turk didn't want me
to say anything</i>

13:16.963 --> 13:18.919
<i>was because this had just happened.</i>

13:20.842 --> 13:23.640
You know those two upstairs
who got hit by the drunk driver?

13:24.220 --> 13:27.371
The daughter's gonna make it,
but the mom died.

13:27.849 --> 13:30.158
<i>Anyway, back to the present.</i>

13:30.810 --> 13:33.324
Last night,
I got arrested for drunk driving.

13:35.190 --> 13:37.658
But I swear to you all,
it is not a big deal.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.254
No, he didn't.

13:39.527 --> 13:43.042
<i>And suddenly I knew what it felt like
to be universally despised.</i>

13:50.872 --> 13:52.863
Fire!

13:53.375 --> 13:56.890
As some of you know,
I'm not a huge fan of fire, okay?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.604
So, why don't we talk this out?
I'll go first.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.752
Carl, obviously, I owe you an apology.
I ate your daughter's face.

14:08.139 --> 14:11.370
Uncool, Carl. Not down with the fire.

14:18.900 --> 14:23.178
Okay, in here we have Mrs Frank,
who is in renal failure,

14:23.488 --> 14:27.527
and over here we have Dr Turtlehead,
who is suffering from

14:27.826 --> 14:30.943
a severe case of the "sulkies. "

14:31.204 --> 14:34.162
Symptoms include bad posture,
mopey face

14:34.416 --> 14:37.533
and a sudden uncontrollable flailing
of the upper extremities.

14:39.254 --> 14:42.405
Is it possible I've misdiagnosed
this malady?

14:43.508 --> 14:46.864
- No!
- There it is. That a boy.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.490
Beat it, all of you!

14:49.681 --> 14:52.195
I can't lie to a patient
'cause Dr Kelso wants me to.

14:52.851 --> 14:56.605
See that guy in there?
He has pancreatic cancer.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.445
Now, you and I both know he's a goner,
but if he were to come out here

15:00.734 --> 15:03.407
and ask if he has hope,
what am I supposed to say, "No"?

15:03.737 --> 15:07.286
- So are you saying I should lie?
- Of course not.

15:07.574 --> 15:11.328
See that guy over there?
Now, the only way he is ever gonna

15:11.619 --> 15:15.168
walk again is if he goes through years
of painful physical therapy,

15:15.457 --> 15:18.096
but if he was to come over here
and ask me, "Is it gonna be hard?"

15:18.335 --> 15:21.293
I'd tell him, "Damn skippy,
it's gonna be hard. " Gandhi,

15:21.546 --> 15:23.138
you gotta tell your patients the truth.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.853
Now, is that brain of yours
starting to hurt?

15:25.050 --> 15:28.679
It should, because it's not as large
as a normal-size brain.

15:28.970 --> 15:32.963
Listen carefully. Kelso lies
selfishly and indiscriminately.

15:33.308 --> 15:36.459
You, you gotta draw your own line.

15:37.312 --> 15:41.908
This is half an ibuprofen. It is the
perfect dose for your pea-sized brain.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.872
Take it after I leave. You'll save
yourself the embarrassment.

15:56.039 --> 16:00.988
Dr Dorian? I promised the Janitor
I'd show you this e-mail.

16:01.336 --> 16:04.806
Can you guys look away?
I need to enter my password.

16:07.050 --> 16:11.726
Alligator3. Okay, you can look now.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.581
<i>Ahoy!
I just wanted to update you on my trip.</i>

16:15.809 --> 16:19.802
<i>Yesterday, we took over the ship.
Captured a bunch of people</i>

16:20.105 --> 16:22.744
<i>and tied them up, pirate-style.
Now, we can do whatever we want,</i>

16:22.982 --> 16:27.692
<i>including this. Watch.
Anything goes, man.</i>

16:28.196 --> 16:32.109
<i>I gotta go, it's my turn to steer.
Step on the gas!</i>

16:32.409 --> 16:36.163
<i>Hey, thinking about you, hope
everything's going as well for you.</i>

16:37.247 --> 16:39.522
It's not. I can't even convince
the voice in my head

16:39.749 --> 16:41.580
that things are gonna turn around.

16:41.793 --> 16:44.865
<i>- What do you want me to say, man?
- Hey, come on, buddy,</i>

16:45.130 --> 16:47.086
we'll cheer you up. Come on.

16:49.843 --> 16:53.836
There you are. You gotta help
pull J.D. out of this spiral.

16:54.222 --> 16:57.612
Any other day, I'd say "No,"
but today, I'm gonna go ahead

16:57.892 --> 17:00.247
- and just say, "No. "
- He took care of you when you were

17:00.478 --> 17:02.833
wallowing on your couch drinking
Scotch like it was vodka.

17:03.189 --> 17:06.339
I accidentally killed three people.
He got arrested for pushing a scooter,

17:06.608 --> 17:10.079
- and he passes out when he poos.
- Okay, you're going to help him.

17:10.363 --> 17:14.481
But just answer me this one question.
After six long years,

17:14.784 --> 17:16.934
aren't you getting tired
of taking care of him?

17:17.454 --> 17:20.127
Of course we are,
but we're his friends.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.090
<i>I heard every word.</i>

17:22.291 --> 17:25.284
<i>See, unfortunately,
I had forgotten that Ted and Todd</i>

17:25.545 --> 17:28.502
<i>were under janitorial orders
to tape me to the ceiling.</i>

17:31.593 --> 17:33.948
<i>But forgetting things isn't always bad.</i>

17:34.179 --> 17:37.410
So, Dr Turk, you psyched
to do my surgery today?

17:38.016 --> 17:38.971
What?

17:39.142 --> 17:41.702
<i>In fact, it can give you
a second chance.</i>

17:41.936 --> 17:43.369
Duct tape five!

17:48.485 --> 17:51.875
That guy is such a meathead.
I always thought you surgeons were

17:52.155 --> 17:56.467
a bunch of brainiacs. I'm sure you got
straight A's since pre-school, right?

17:56.826 --> 17:59.340
<i>A second chance
to define who you truly are.</i>

17:59.579 --> 18:02.377
Are you kidding?
My girlfriend wasn't the only one

18:02.624 --> 18:05.582
with 34 C's in high school.
You know what I'm sayin'?

18:07.879 --> 18:11.838
Still don't know what I'm sayin'?
I was an average student.

18:12.342 --> 18:13.331
Really?

18:14.177 --> 18:18.295
But when I realised I wanted to be
a surgeon, I got my act together.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.351
Brian, if I didn't think I was the
right person to perform this operation,

18:21.601 --> 18:24.559
I wouldn't do it. Okay?

18:25.647 --> 18:26.716
Okay.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.583
<i>During those two hours
I was stuck to the ceiling,</i>

18:30.819 --> 18:32.889
<i>I witnessed some pretty weird things.</i>

18:33.530 --> 18:34.883
I'll see you tonight, Dad.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.573
<i>But mostly, I witnessed the greatest
hits of my own self-pity.</i>

18:39.077 --> 18:40.715
I can't get Dr Cox to notice me.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.870
I'm dating my best friend,
but I don't think I love her.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.405
I'm lonely.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.698
I'm a loser.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.200
You've gotta help me out.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.970
- Help me out.
- Help me.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.809
<i>And I understood how my friends felt,</i>

18:52.007 --> 18:54.840
<i>because I couldn't stand it
for two hours, let alone six years.</i>

18:55.468 --> 18:58.938
I wash it every day, I condition,
but I just can't get it where I want it.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.971
For the love of God, mousse and twist!

19:12.318 --> 19:14.548
Don't you have something
you want to say?

19:15.655 --> 19:21.252
Listen, I would really like it if
you'd go out and grab a beer with me.

19:22.704 --> 19:23.978
What do you say?

19:24.372 --> 19:26.886
<i>And even though I'd finally gotten
a totally sincere,</i>

19:27.125 --> 19:31.323
<i>spontaneous invite from Dr Cox,
I knew my answer.</i>

19:31.629 --> 19:38.148
- No, thanks. I have plans.
- Thank you, God! Yes, that still counts.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.962
<i>I didn't have plans, but I did have
a whole new perspective.</i>

19:43.725 --> 19:46.398
<i>You can stick to your convictions
and hopefully get rewarded.</i>

19:46.644 --> 19:48.236
Okay, everybody.

19:48.438 --> 19:51.794
I want everyone to stay focused. Good
work today, nothing but your best.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.136
Are we clear?

19:53.360 --> 19:55.191
<i>Even if other people end up
a little peeved.</i>

20:02.410 --> 20:04.640
This will only make you stronger.

20:06.206 --> 20:10.358
<i>And, yeah, my life was still in the
crapper, but it felt good to finally</i>

20:10.669 --> 20:11.988
<i>be dealing with it on my own.</i>

20:13.505 --> 20:15.621
Okay, he bought the fake cruise.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.956
If he calls the cops now,
nobody's coming.

20:18.176 --> 20:21.088
Time for phase three of
Operation: Boy Who Cried Wolf.

20:21.346 --> 20:23.416
Now, Jason,
we've worked on this all week, right?

20:23.973 --> 20:27.886
Here's what you're thinking.
I'm lost in the city, I'm hungry,

20:28.186 --> 20:31.098
and this is the guy that killed my mom
with a snowmobile.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.633
Make me believe it.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.665
And go!

20:45.036 --> 20:46.867
Seriously, bad wolfie, bad wolfie!

20:47.080 --> 20:50.789
Not in the face, not in the face!
Jason, stop! Janitor. Wrong guy!

20:51.084 --> 20:52.483
Bad, Jason, no!

20:52.669 --> 20:54.660
<i>Yup, things were finally looking up.</i>

20:54.879 --> 20:57.871
Oh, man! No, Jason. No! Whoa!
