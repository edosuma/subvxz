WEBVTT

00:20.770 --> 00:21.729
-So?
-So what?

00:21.813 --> 00:22.813
-So tell me.
-What?

00:22.897 --> 00:24.023
-About last night.
-Are you kidding me?

00:24.107 --> 00:25.232
-Yeah.
-Are you fucking kidding me?

00:25.316 --> 00:26.692
-Yeah.
-Are you pulling my leg?

00:26.776 --> 00:29.028
-So?
-So, tits out to here. So.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.946
-Yeah?
-Yeah, twenty-couple years old.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.448
-You gotta be fooling.
-No.

00:32.531 --> 00:34.616
-You devil.
-What, you think she hadn't been around?

00:34.701 --> 00:35.784
-Yeah.
-Hadn't gone the route?

00:35.869 --> 00:37.870
-She knew the route, did she?
-Are you fucking kidding me?

00:37.954 --> 00:39.413
-Yeah?
-She wrote the route.

00:39.497 --> 00:41.665
-No shit? So tell me.
-So, okay, so where am l?

00:41.750 --> 00:43.250
So, you're probably at the Pancake House.

00:43.334 --> 00:46.545
So, okay, I'm over at the Pancake House.

00:46.629 --> 00:49.423
Who walks in over to the cash register
but this chick?

00:49.507 --> 00:50.799
-Right.
-Yeah, 1 9, 20-year-old chick.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.719
-Who we're talking about.
-She wants to buy a pack of Viceroys.

00:53.803 --> 00:54.887
l can believe it.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.722
Gets the smokes and does this number

00:56.806 --> 00:59.475
about how she forgot her purse
up in her room.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.268
-Up in her room?
-Yeah.

01:01.352 --> 01:02.895
-Was she a pro?
-At that age?

01:02.979 --> 01:05.230
-Yeah.
-Well, at this point, we don't know.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.901
So down we sit. We get to talking, this, that.
Blah, blah, blah.

01:08.985 --> 01:12.196
And it's, "Come up to my room
and l'll pay you back for the smokes."

01:12.280 --> 01:13.405
-No.
-Yeah.

01:13.490 --> 01:14.448
-You're shitting me.
-l'm telling you.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.742
-And was she a pro?
-At this point, we don't know.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.787
But up we go, and it's,
"Sit down. You want a drink?"

01:20.080 --> 01:22.831
"Well, what do you got?" "Bourbon." "Fine."

01:22.916 --> 01:25.375
And then what shot does she up and pull?

01:25.460 --> 01:28.629
A, she says,
"l think l want to take a shower."

01:28.713 --> 01:30.506
-No.
-Yeah.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.300
And, B, she says, "Then let's fuck."

01:33.384 --> 01:35.052
-She said that?
-What did l just tell you?

01:35.136 --> 01:38.430
-You're... Was she a pro?
-At this point, we don't know.

01:38.515 --> 01:43.102
So, anyway, l do say, "l'll join you
in the shower, if you have no objections."

01:43.186 --> 01:45.270
-Of course.
-So into the old shower we go.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.648
-Does this broad have a body?
-Yeah?

01:47.732 --> 01:49.191
-Are you kidding me?
-So tell me.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.401
-The tits, the legs...
-Yeah? The ass?

01:51.486 --> 01:53.695
Are you fucking fooling me?
The ass on this broad!

01:53.863 --> 01:55.155
-Young ass?
-Well, yeah.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.324
-Young broad, young ass.
-Right.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.910
So, anyway, we get out,
toweling each other off

01:59.994 --> 02:02.162
-in his and her full glory.
-Yeah.

02:02.247 --> 02:05.749
But while we're toweling off,
l flick the towel at her, very playfully like.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.544
And by accident, it catches her
a good one on the ass.

02:08.627 --> 02:10.838
-We got this big red mark.
-No.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.965
Well, l'm all sorry and so forth.

02:13.049 --> 02:16.885
But what does this broad do,
but let out a squeal of pleasure relief

02:16.970 --> 02:19.388
-that would fucking kill a horse?
-No.

02:19.597 --> 02:23.225
So, what the hell? l'm liberal.
l pick up a chair and heave it at her.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.310
-Draw blood?
-At this point, no.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.896
But what does she say? "Wait a minute!"

02:28.022 --> 02:30.816
She crawls under the bed,
pulls out this suitcase from under the bed.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.152
From out of the suitcase
comes this World War ll flak suit.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.653
-They're hard to find.
-Sure.

02:34.737 --> 02:37.489
Zip, zip, zip. She gets into the flak suit.
We get down on the bed.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.491
-What are you doing?
-We're fucking.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.160
-But she's in the flak suit?
-Right.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.704
-Well, how do you get in?
-Well, she leaves the zipper open.

02:43.830 --> 02:47.708
-Right. Right.
-But the shot is, every 30 seconds or so,

02:47.792 --> 02:50.252
she wants me to go, "Boom!"
at the top of my lungs.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.962
-At her?
-No, just in general.

02:52.046 --> 02:54.756
So we're humping and pumping
and greasing the old flak suit.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.049
Every once in a while l go, "Boom!"

02:56.134 --> 02:58.635
ln the middle of everything,
she slithers over the side of the bed,

02:58.720 --> 03:00.304
turns on a little Sony tape recorder.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.472
Wait. Wait. Wait.
l don't know what the shot is, right?

03:02.557 --> 03:04.766
All of the sudden l hear,
coming out of the tape recorder...

03:08.771 --> 03:13.358
So, fine. l'm pumping away,
the tape recorder's making airplane noises.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.027
Every once in a while l go, "Boom!"

03:15.111 --> 03:17.905
and the broad on the bed
starts going crazy, right?

03:17.989 --> 03:20.157
She's moaning and groaning.
l'm humping and bumping.

03:20.241 --> 03:23.202
She's screaming,
"Red Dog One to Red Dog Squadron," right?

03:23.286 --> 03:25.245
All of the sudden she screams,
"Wait a minute!" Right?

03:25.330 --> 03:28.207
She leaps under the bed,
pulls out a five-gallon jerry can.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.043
-Right.
-Opens it up. lt's full of gasoline.

03:31.127 --> 03:35.380
She splashes some all over the walls,
whips a fucking Zippo out of her flak suit,

03:35.465 --> 03:38.342
and the whole room
goes up in flames, right?

03:38.426 --> 03:41.970
So the tape recorder's going...
The room's full of smoke, right?

03:42.055 --> 03:46.183
The broad jumps back on the bed
and she screams, "Now! Give it to me now,

03:46.309 --> 03:48.936
"for the love of Christ!"

03:55.068 --> 03:57.778
So l look at the broad,

03:57.862 --> 04:02.324
and l figure, fuck this nonsense.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.035
One, two, six, I'm in the haII,
struggling with my shorts.

04:05.161 --> 04:08.538
Make it to the elevator,
whole place is filled with smoke.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.667
Elevator arrives,
the whole hall's filled with firemen.

04:13.294 --> 04:16.588
You know, those fucking firemen
make out like bandits.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.589
Nobody does it normally anymore.

04:18.675 --> 04:22.261
lt's these young broads, Danny.
They don't know what the fuck they want.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.388
Do you think she was a pro?

04:25.682 --> 04:28.183
-A pro, Dan.
-Yeah.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.520
A pro is how you think of yourself.

04:33.022 --> 04:35.399
-See my point?
-Right.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.443
Come on, you scumbags, last inning!
Only one run down!

04:38.528 --> 04:41.154
We hold them down!
We'll catch them in our half!

04:41.239 --> 04:42.322
Todd, get up.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.449
-Who's that over there?
-Where? Where? Where? Where?

04:44.909 --> 04:46.410
-Which one?
-Right there.

04:46.494 --> 04:47.995
-Cute guys.
-Here comes Debbie's boss.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.247
He looks good. Let's see if he can hit.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.167
Come on, Mr. Carlson!

04:59.465 --> 05:03.218
Out! Out, out, out.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.722
Good play, Danny! Good one, Dan.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.557
All right, no stick now. No stick.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.226
That second baseman
has got a really nice ass.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.311
He does.

05:12.395 --> 05:15.772
l refuse to go out with a man
whose ass is smaller than mine.

05:15.857 --> 05:16.982
-Really?
-Me, too.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.692
Your dates are gonna be pretty scarce.

05:31.914 --> 05:33.749
Very nice catch, Danny.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.169
All right, Danny.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.171
...your date, God forbid.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.507
l'm making a beer run. Anybody?

05:43.176 --> 05:44.426
Yeah. Thirsty?

05:44.510 --> 05:46.178
-Thanks.
-No, thank you.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.430
Go get him. Go on.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.642
Oh, God, it's the guy with the cute ass.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.855
-Go for it.
-Come on!

05:58.941 --> 06:02.903
Hey, Bernie! For me and Mother!
Come on, honey!

06:03.613 --> 06:05.197
Here, let me help you.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.115
Do it, Big Bernie, do it!

06:13.664 --> 06:17.209
-Anytime l can give you a hand.
-l'm finished. Just give yourself a hand.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.130
Come on, guys.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.133
Looks good. lt's going, it's going. lt's gone!

06:29.472 --> 06:32.140
Yeah!

06:48.658 --> 06:51.368
Put me down! Put me down!

06:57.667 --> 07:01.545
Mother's is giving a party tonight!
Winners and losers!

07:01.629 --> 07:03.088
Mr. Carlson, that was such a good game.

07:03.172 --> 07:06.216
Carrie, l don't want to hear about it
right now, okay?

07:08.219 --> 07:10.011
Steve, are you going to Mother's?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.847
l doubt it.

07:13.641 --> 07:18.145
You know, l've been meaning to mention
that it's really stupid to fuck your boss.

07:19.021 --> 07:22.899
l mean, for starters,
it's a damn good way to lose yourjob.

07:36.038 --> 07:39.583
-Guess who walked in here last night?
-Not the redhead.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.919
The redhead was here last night?
What did she say?

07:43.004 --> 07:46.590
-Ask Bernie. He took her home.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

07:46.674 --> 07:50.260
You know, the thing about redheads
is lack of pigmentation.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.262
Well, they're almost albino.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.431
-You bang an albino?
-No.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.433
Well, l have, and they're nuts.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.727
Welcome, ladies! Welcome to Mother's.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.062
We're honored. Come on, follow Mother.

08:03.524 --> 08:06.902
-So, where are the guys from your team?
-Sulking.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.947
-First round's on Mother.
-Thank you.

08:12.074 --> 08:14.075
l'll be back in a minute, you guys.

08:14.410 --> 08:17.829
You know, they're gonna come at me
tomorrow like savages.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.499
Marauding beasts bent on destruction.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.459
-Stop it.
-Deborah...

08:22.585 --> 08:26.296
Deborah, you work in advertising, all right?
lt is a civilized business.

08:26.380 --> 08:29.132
l, on the other hand, work with monsters.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.967
You're talking about five-year-olds.

08:31.052 --> 08:35.804
Right, and my job is to break their spirit.
That's what kindergarten is all about.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.808
The Germans invented it, Deborah.
Think about it.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.729
Oh, God, Pat's going in for the kill.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.399
That's a nice turn.

08:46.484 --> 08:49.110
-Coy.
-With just a hint of giddiness.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.821
Her big move
should be coming up any moment.

08:51.906 --> 08:55.283
The combination hair flip with a giggle.

08:55.576 --> 08:58.745
There's a 3.2 degree of difficulty here, Joan.
Let's see if she can pull it off.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.455
This is it. This is it.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.082
-Yes.
-Yes.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.917
-Yes!
-Yes!

09:04.794 --> 09:06.628
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

09:06.796 --> 09:09.881
-Bravo! Yes!
-Bravo! 9.0! 9.0!

09:12.301 --> 09:16.471
Now, look it, tell me. Tell me getting these
advertising babes here wasn't perfect.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.266
Look at that. Pick a pair, any pair.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.893
lt's like shooting fish in a barrel.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.689
We did pretty well for ourselves, huh?

09:25.773 --> 09:28.066
We? Did you say "we"?

09:28.150 --> 09:29.901
You know, you got a lot of brass balls,
you know that?

09:29.986 --> 09:31.903
l do all the work, you take all the credit.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.656
You know what your problem is? Your face.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.324
-Yeah, right.
-Come on. Wise up, man.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.243
You're too good-looking.

09:38.327 --> 09:40.328
These girls go out with you
and they get nervous, man.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.622
They feel dumpy.
They don't want to compete.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.875
They want a guy like... Like me.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.753
You know, a guy that's gonna
make them look good.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.965
-Right. A basic Neanderthal type.
-Right. Your swarthy type.

09:52.049 --> 09:53.758
A man's man. A kind of guy who's...

09:53.843 --> 09:56.386
-Oozing testosterone?
-Exactly.

09:56.470 --> 09:59.431
A young woman in today's society,
she wants a little bulk in her diet.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.726
-Yeah, she wants a big guy who sweats.
-Yeah. Right.

10:02.810 --> 10:06.688
Best thing that could happen to you, Danny,
is an industrial accident.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.403
-You know...
-Excuse me.

10:13.487 --> 10:14.946
You're not leaving, are you?

10:15.031 --> 10:18.158
No, we're walking in backwards.

10:18.242 --> 10:21.244
-l'm Debbie.
-Hi. Dan.

10:22.538 --> 10:27.542
This is Joan, my roommate.
She specializes in unsolicited attacks.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.086
Deb, we're going to lrving's, right?

10:30.171 --> 10:33.965
lt's a 4:00 dive for us Kamikaze pilots.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.885
Right. l've been bombed there
a couple times myself.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.972
Quit while you're ahead, okay? Deb.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.937
-So...
-So...

10:49.523 --> 10:52.484
So, l couldn't help noticing you

10:52.568 --> 10:55.153
and noticing you noticing me.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.155
There was a clock over your head.

11:12.588 --> 11:15.382
-So...
-So...

11:56.257 --> 11:59.300
l'll bet these have been put to a lot of use.

11:59.760 --> 12:03.513
They work? Good.
'Cause l just got them today.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.644
Shit. Shit.

13:10.873 --> 13:14.918
-You don't have to run right off.
-Yes, l do.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.921
lt's really...
lt's been a slice of heaven, all right?

13:18.005 --> 13:21.841
l just have to go home.
lt's a habit of mine. And...

13:23.552 --> 13:26.054
-Here, l can turn on a light.
-No, no, no. That's all right.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.892
Well, bye.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.229
Yeah. Bye.

13:37.733 --> 13:40.777
-Listen, l could give you a ride home.
-No. No, thanks. Really.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.445
Bye. Thank you.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.074
Thank you.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.795
What are you doing out here?

13:58.879 --> 14:02.882
l have this guy in my room. This big guy.

14:02.967 --> 14:07.512
Real drunk. Real cute.
l mean, this guy is huge.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.016
He's laying facedown,
kitty-corner on the bed

14:12.101 --> 14:13.768
like a big old beached whale.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.353
-Come on, you have to see.
-No.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.981
No, he is dead drunk. He is out like a light.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.487
lt would take a crane to get him out.

14:31.495 --> 14:32.954
Didn't l tell you?

14:34.498 --> 14:36.332
So, did you have a nice evening?

14:36.417 --> 14:39.544
Yes, l did,
and then l crawled away in shame.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.713
Aren't we a couple of sluts?

14:43.549 --> 14:46.467
l can't believe that l slept with him
on the first date.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.803
There wasn't even a date.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.972
Thank you.

14:52.141 --> 14:57.186
l tell you, l couldn't help myself
because he is so gorgeous.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.855
But can he type?

15:03.402 --> 15:06.738
Well, l guess you'll have the bed to yourself.

15:08.449 --> 15:11.701
But here's the shot.
She's got this fur-lined bed, right?

15:11.785 --> 15:13.244
-What kind of fur?
-l don't know what kind of fur,

15:13.329 --> 15:14.495
but it's fur, all right?

15:14.580 --> 15:16.873
And the static electricity
that is being caused

15:16.957 --> 15:20.001
is sending these little sparks
right to my nuts.

15:20.836 --> 15:23.254
You know, l felt like a human jumper cable.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.174
No shit.

15:27.509 --> 15:31.054
-So, you score last night?
-Yeah.

15:31.180 --> 15:34.015
Yeah, double headphone deal?

15:34.224 --> 15:36.100
Yeah, right.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.561
That chick, is she hot?

15:42.107 --> 15:45.026
-Yeah, she was fun.
-Fun?

15:45.861 --> 15:48.196
Fun? She was fun?

15:49.323 --> 15:51.115
Yeah, she...

15:52.660 --> 15:54.869
Have you ever done it in a plane?

15:54.954 --> 16:00.458
Yeah. Yeah, l once nailed
two stewardesses in a 747 at 35,000 feet.

16:01.418 --> 16:05.254
You know what? lt was fun.

16:06.548 --> 16:09.175
l had a fun time.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.345
Favio. Are you ready for this?

16:12.429 --> 16:13.846
-Yeah. Yeah, cheap son of a bitch.
-Are you ready?

16:13.931 --> 16:16.099
Come on, you haven't ordered silverware
in over six months.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.142
Are your customers eating with their toes?

16:18.227 --> 16:21.980
-Throw in a plastic steak marker.
-Look, l'll throw in a plastic steak marker.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.565
lf some kid throws up on them, man,
you don't have to worry about it.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.067
-Push the French fries.
-Yeah. Yeah...

16:26.193 --> 16:28.653
-French fries. French fries.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:28.737 --> 16:30.488
They're fabulous.
l'm sure you're gonna love them.

16:30.572 --> 16:33.491
Okay. Okay. Sure.
No, anything you want for a deal.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.669
Hello?

16:45.254 --> 16:46.295
Hello.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.256
Hello. Debbie?

16:48.716 --> 16:49.799
Who's this?

16:49.925 --> 16:52.301
lt's Dan. Dan Martin.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.095
From last night.

16:54.430 --> 16:59.058
Yeah. Look, l wanted to talk to you
about last night.

16:59.143 --> 17:02.770
What an amazing coincidence.
That's what l'm calling about. Last night.

17:03.355 --> 17:07.817
Listen, l was pretty drunk last night.
Did anything happen?

17:08.318 --> 17:10.903
No. Absolutely nothing. Want to do it again?

17:11.155 --> 17:14.031
l mean, would you like to get together again
for a drink?

17:14.116 --> 17:15.950
l'm awfully sorry.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.703
Come on, we picked up the phone
at the same time. l think that's a sign.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.329
lt was a fluke. Last night was a fluke.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.415
Debbie.

17:24.960 --> 17:29.047
Could you send up two pages
of the 36-point Bodoni Bold press?

17:29.131 --> 17:31.466
Can you bring me this layout
to Conference Room E?

17:31.592 --> 17:33.426
-ls that your boss?
-Yeah.

17:33.510 --> 17:36.095
Well, listen. Meet me at Mother's at 6:00.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.388
And don't take me for granted

17:37.473 --> 17:39.599
'cause l'm only gonna wait there
for four or five hours.

17:40.017 --> 17:43.644
No. No. l won't need any. Yeah. Thank you.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.774
The broad from last night, huh?

17:47.900 --> 17:50.735
Yeah. l pick up the phone to make a call
and she's on the line.

17:50.819 --> 17:54.113
Yeah, right.
Pull this leg and it plays Jingle Bells.

17:56.658 --> 18:00.328
-l'm really sorry about last night.
-That's okay.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.164
See what happens
when you take life too seriously?

18:04.666 --> 18:09.212
-What did you do last night?
-Went home and took some lithium. You?

18:11.006 --> 18:14.717
Are you busy for lunch?
How about a nice long one at my apartment?

18:14.802 --> 18:18.262
l can't. This stuff's due tonight.
Maybe tomorrow.

18:18.722 --> 18:20.056
Tomorrow.

18:24.686 --> 18:27.980
They're fine. Well, the first week
they're too scared to cause any trouble.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.441
-Miss Gunther?
-Wait a second.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.486
Lisa, honey, l am on the telephone, all right?

18:35.197 --> 18:36.948
-The baseball player, he called you?
-Miss Gunther.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.241
Wait a sec. Hang on.

18:38.325 --> 18:41.035
Lisa, you really shouldn't be out here
wandering in the halls.

18:41.912 --> 18:46.124
What? l will go with you
if you need a chaperone.

18:46.208 --> 18:50.336
Look, l have to go pick up some art supplies.
So why don't you just meet me at Horder's?

18:50.420 --> 18:52.421
l will buy you a Mickey Mouse pencil holder.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.423
-Wait. Hang on.
-Miss Gunther.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.931
Look, Deb, l really have to go.
No, l will meet you at 5:00. Okay?

19:02.015 --> 19:03.641
Yes. Yes. Bye.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.394
lt's okay. Honey, come here.

19:08.772 --> 19:14.527
You know, everybody wets their pants,
and nobody has to know about it.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.448
What size do you wear? 6X?

19:20.075 --> 19:24.412
Well, l just happen to have
an extra pair in my locker

19:25.247 --> 19:29.125
with little pictures of Wonder Woman
all over them.

19:29.293 --> 19:34.338
-Bernie, Bernie, they're here.
-Great. l guess l get the dog.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.340
-Hi. How are you?
-Hey.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.385
Come on, sit down. Here.
Here you go. Here. Sit.

19:39.469 --> 19:42.263
Bernie, this is Debbie. Debbie, this is Bernie.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.431
-Hi.
-Hi.

19:44.099 --> 19:47.977
You know, you're a very attractive woman.
Anybody ever tell you that before?

19:50.731 --> 19:52.231
-Bernie.
-What?

19:52.316 --> 19:54.150
This is...

19:56.612 --> 19:58.613
-Joan.
-Bernie.

19:58.822 --> 20:03.284
Joan, that's a nice name. So sit down.
You want a drink? Mother, some drinks.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.871
l don't want anything. l... l gotta go.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.750
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

20:11.418 --> 20:14.045
-What do you do?
-Me?

20:14.129 --> 20:16.005
Well, yeah, for a living?

20:16.089 --> 20:18.716
l'm a neurosurgeon. You?

20:18.800 --> 20:21.219
l'm a professional boxer.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.179
-You know much about the fight game?
-No.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.306
l'm the heavyweight champion of the world.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.767
Well, it's nice to meet you, champ,
but l gotta go.

20:27.851 --> 20:30.228
Wait. Come on. One drink.
One drink's not gonna hurt.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.313
l have something better to do.

20:33.315 --> 20:36.859
Deb, l'll meet you at the steam bath
tomorrow at 6:00. Dan.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.989
Yeah, nice meeting you.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.786
lnteresting broad.

20:46.954 --> 20:50.039
Where did she develop her personality?
ln a car crash?

20:50.415 --> 20:52.375
She really is very nice
once you get to know her.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.460
Yeah, yeah, right, sure.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.091
Are you gonna sit down?

21:00.259 --> 21:02.218
Shoot, no, no, no, no.

21:02.302 --> 21:06.389
l'm gonna let you guys do
what you guys gotta do.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.724
Don't worry about me.
l'm just gonna go home,

21:08.809 --> 21:10.977
make a little macaroni and cheese,

21:11.061 --> 21:15.147
seal the window and turn on the gas.
l'll be all right.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.441
-l'll see you tomorrow, Bernie.
-Yeah, Danny.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.365
Fashionably late.

21:25.909 --> 21:30.496
Well, l just thought you might be
fool enough to sit here until midnight.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.503
Don't look at me like
the cat who just ate the canary,

21:37.587 --> 21:40.715
because this is as far as this goes tonight.

21:48.515 --> 21:51.017
Are you cold? Do you want a T-shirt?

21:52.185 --> 21:54.145
l don't need anything.

21:55.897 --> 21:59.817
Are you okay? l mean, did you...

21:59.901 --> 22:02.194
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

22:02.487 --> 22:03.946
Couldn't you tell?

22:05.198 --> 22:10.119
Yeah. l mean, you know, girls
sometimes, it's...

22:11.204 --> 22:13.831
l mean, guys... You know.

22:13.915 --> 22:17.418
Yeah. We figure we'll just
keep you in the dark

22:17.502 --> 22:19.587
and then that way
maybe you'll work a little harder.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.340
-You're full of secrets, aren't you?
-lt's a conspiracy.

22:22.424 --> 22:25.468
-l knew it. l knew it.
-Just to throw you off balance.

22:27.262 --> 22:29.221
You wanna know something else?

22:29.306 --> 22:33.976
We went out with, you know, older guys
in high school just to make you jealous.

22:34.061 --> 22:37.980
l knew that, too. Okay, come on, what else?

22:39.107 --> 22:44.111
Well, our girlfriends,
they're really lesbian lovers.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.030
Every one of them.

22:46.114 --> 22:50.242
You must hate us, l mean, as a race.
Don't you?

22:50.327 --> 22:51.786
Yes, we do.

22:54.247 --> 22:56.040
-Tell me one.
-What?

22:56.124 --> 22:57.583
-A secret?
-Yeah.

22:57.667 --> 23:01.670
l don't have any secrets.
l mean, what you see is what you get.

23:07.969 --> 23:09.387
You going home?

23:11.807 --> 23:15.267
l was stretching.
Do you want me to go home?

23:15.352 --> 23:19.188
No, l... Well, do you want to?

23:19.356 --> 23:21.357
Well, do you want me to stay?

23:22.234 --> 23:24.819
l mean, l don't know
if it's such a good idea if l stay.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.822
lt doesn't mean anything if you stay.

23:31.827 --> 23:35.454
l'd like you to stay, if you want to.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.170
Yeah. All right.

23:43.922 --> 23:47.925
Yeah. Well, all right. l'll stay.

23:48.009 --> 23:53.347
l am getting sick and tired
of you making fun of me.

25:10.258 --> 25:11.550
What?

25:12.761 --> 25:14.845
l like this place.

25:15.013 --> 25:18.098
"Place"? Come on, this is a joint.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.519
Look at the fixtures in here.

25:21.686 --> 25:25.523
Everything in here. l mean, the Formica.
You can't even get this Formica anymore.

25:25.607 --> 25:28.108
Everything in here is all art deco, isn't it?

25:29.361 --> 25:31.445
Yeah, kind of.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.533
Yo, Gus. How about a refill?

25:35.617 --> 25:37.785
Yo, Danny, you know where the coffee is.

25:37.869 --> 25:40.704
l've got a date l'm trying to impress here.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.082
You shouldn't have brought her here, then.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.209
ls this the way you talk
to all your customers?

25:45.293 --> 25:46.835
All three of them.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.386
l like this joint.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.157
-You remember last night in bed?
-Yeah.

26:17.325 --> 26:21.161
-You wanted to know something about me.
-Yeah.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.915
l wanna own my own restaurant.

26:27.794 --> 26:32.047
l mean, nothing fancy,
but a real first-class joint.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.966
Danny's.

26:34.884 --> 26:35.884
l know, who am l kidding?

26:35.969 --> 26:37.720
l'm never gonna have
that kind of money, right?

26:38.388 --> 26:40.264
Yeah, l guess it all falls apart right there.

26:40.348 --> 26:41.557
No. l mean, you wouldn't believe

26:41.641 --> 26:43.809
what you got to go through in this town
to get a liquor license.

26:43.893 --> 26:46.770
-lt's an outrage.
-lt's a goddamn scandal.

26:47.647 --> 26:50.691
Washed up at 24. lt's tragic.

26:51.818 --> 26:54.069
You know what? You're all right.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.878
lf you answer it, l'll kill you.

27:18.970 --> 27:22.097
-Where the hell have you been?
-l'm sorry. l got hung up.

27:23.933 --> 27:25.434
Steve called.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.978
-What'd he say?
-What do you think he said?

27:28.063 --> 27:30.022
He said, where the hell were you?

27:31.232 --> 27:33.108
And what'd you tell him?

27:33.735 --> 27:38.072
l told him that you have to wait 24 hours
before you file a missing person's report.

27:39.324 --> 27:42.785
l just thought you were
in somebody's trunk or something.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.958
-l was with Danny.
-You were with Danny.

27:51.086 --> 27:54.171
l waited for you at the steam bath place.

27:54.255 --> 27:59.468
Just sweating my ass off with a bunch
of fat women from the old country

27:59.552 --> 28:01.804
who don't speak any English.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.889
What was l supposed to do? Talk to myself?

28:03.973 --> 28:06.934
-l'm sorry.
-"l'm sorry."

28:07.018 --> 28:11.438
You know, it's the same old thing, Deborah.
lt's the same old crap.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.232
You know, l bet in high school,
you were one of those girls

28:13.316 --> 28:15.984
that just sort of dropped your friends
like a hot potato

28:16.069 --> 28:17.778
whenever some guy would call.

28:17.862 --> 28:20.280
-Who didn't?
-l didn't.

28:21.408 --> 28:24.535
Of course, l didn't have
a whole lot of dates anyway.

28:24.619 --> 28:27.705
-Don't pull that.
-lt's not fair. All right?

28:27.789 --> 28:29.540
We have been friends for a long time

28:29.624 --> 28:32.126
because we don't take
each other for granted.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.462
l'm sorry.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.132
l got hurt.

28:39.008 --> 28:41.593
l guess l'm just a little too sensitive.

28:41.720 --> 28:45.013
So, what's for breakfast?

28:45.098 --> 28:48.308
Egg McMuffin,
corner of Broadway and Belmont.

28:53.732 --> 28:57.401
-He was supposed to come today.
-But he didn't. He came a day earlier.

28:57.485 --> 28:59.862
This is a big city.
You gotta expect that, Danny.

28:59.946 --> 29:01.405
This is a business!

29:01.489 --> 29:03.657
You know, what you did, you don't do that.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.201
Hell, l'd like to spend a day with my kid.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.954
You know, l'm sure Mrs. Lyons here
would like to spend a day with her family,

29:09.038 --> 29:10.706
but we don't do that.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.877
l don't know, Danny. l really don't know.
Let me ask you something.

29:14.961 --> 29:16.670
Who do you think ought to get
the commission?

29:16.755 --> 29:19.047
Hey, l spent three months
setting up this deal.

29:19.132 --> 29:22.259
Who signed it? Me. Who put it to bed? Me.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.303
lt always boils down
to the same thing, Danny.

29:24.387 --> 29:25.971
Business is a game of inches.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.598
Fine, if you don't think l deserve it,
l don't want it.

29:27.682 --> 29:30.893
Hey, l didn't say that.
Look, l want you to have it.

29:30.977 --> 29:34.104
You know, when you started to work here,
l said to you, "Welcome aboard."

29:34.189 --> 29:38.776
And l meant it. All l'm trying to do is,
l'm just trying to show you a lesson.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.911
l'll be just a couple more minutes, Dan.

29:49.704 --> 29:52.706
-How did it go at work today?
-l caught hell.

29:53.833 --> 29:57.461
Oh, God, another smoker.
Look, would you mind?

29:57.545 --> 29:59.379
l'm sorry. You're eating.

29:59.464 --> 30:02.341
l know what you mean.
My boss is mad at me, too.

30:03.051 --> 30:04.051
l bet he was.

30:05.845 --> 30:06.845
There.

30:07.347 --> 30:10.474
l just added another seven minutes
to your life.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.729
-lt's okay. l don't expect a thank you.
-Thank you.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.995
So, worried much
about western civilization?

30:32.080 --> 30:36.208
-Not particularly. Not tonight.
-lt's collapsing. Or hadn't you noticed?

30:36.835 --> 30:38.794
l live in a pretty good neighborhood.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.923
Sorry l kept you waiting.

30:43.716 --> 30:45.342
We've gotta go.
Our movie starts in 1 0 minutes.

30:45.426 --> 30:46.426
Okay.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.681
-Do you want to come with us?
-Sure.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.812
Well, just give me a minute to get ready.

31:07.532 --> 31:10.576
So, tomorrow, are we going
to the auto show or what?

31:10.660 --> 31:15.122
-l was thinking of calling Debbie.
-Seeing a lot of her, huh?

31:15.456 --> 31:17.791
-How many times you call her this week?
-Twice.

31:17.959 --> 31:21.503
Twice? You called her twice?

31:21.588 --> 31:26.466
Dan, never call a broad more than
once a week. Never, ever, ever!

31:28.720 --> 31:31.805
Look, he forgets to call one day,
it's no big deal.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.849
Two days, it's an oversight.

31:33.933 --> 31:37.060
Honey, he hasn't called you in three days.
He's sleeping with somebody else.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.770
Hey, it's a free country.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.356
Well, if he gives you a hard time,
all you have to do is just...

31:41.441 --> 31:43.442
You know, l'll take care of Favio for you.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.405
-That's what's-her-name.
-Debbie.

31:48.489 --> 31:49.489
Debbie, yeah.

31:49.616 --> 31:50.616
Hi.

31:57.081 --> 31:58.332
-Hi.
-Hi.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.084
Well, we're sort of in the middle
of an issue here.

32:01.169 --> 32:04.963
Now, listen, all l'm saying is
if he's gonna sleep over three nights a week,

32:05.048 --> 32:06.840
then he can pay half the rent.

32:06.925 --> 32:10.761
Yeah, but if l ask him to pay half the rent,

32:10.845 --> 32:13.639
then that's like asking him
to move in with me.

32:13.723 --> 32:17.184
All right, what is in it for you, Carrie?
l really don't get it.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.353
Maybe she loves the guy.

32:20.104 --> 32:21.605
Maybe l enjoy it.

32:21.689 --> 32:24.608
Would you put up with a dog that
came home three nights a week?

32:24.692 --> 32:26.860
l mean, what are we talking here?

32:27.195 --> 32:29.279
Excuse me, guys,
l'm gonna go make a phone call.

32:29.864 --> 32:30.864
That was funny.

32:34.327 --> 32:35.702
-Hi.
-Hi.

32:38.873 --> 32:39.873
Hi.

32:42.377 --> 32:45.212
Oh, God. l'm sorry. This is no good.

32:46.422 --> 32:47.422
l'm sorry.

32:49.217 --> 32:52.219
l don't think l can see you anymore.

32:52.387 --> 32:54.972
And don't be offended because l like you.
And you know l do.

32:55.056 --> 32:57.975
l think you're terrific. lt's just that...

32:59.310 --> 33:00.310
Well, l'm...

33:01.270 --> 33:03.188
l'm seeing someone else.

33:04.399 --> 33:08.568
-Who?
-Nobody. l mean, you don't know him.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.112
Okay.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.365
Okay, if that's the way you want it.

33:13.449 --> 33:15.867
See what happens
when people don't say, "l love you"?

33:16.119 --> 33:19.454
You know, sometimes you can be
a real son of a bitch.

33:19.539 --> 33:23.417
Come on. Come on, sweetie. Come on.

33:24.794 --> 33:26.670
l thought we had something kind of special.

33:26.754 --> 33:30.215
No. lt was kind of sleazy.

33:30.675 --> 33:34.094
And now it's kind of over.

33:39.559 --> 33:40.976
Just a minute.

33:50.069 --> 33:51.445
-Hi.
-Hi.

33:51.529 --> 33:54.239
Are you okay? ls something the matter?

33:54.323 --> 33:58.744
Nothing. Everything's great. l just was...

34:00.121 --> 34:02.080
-Bye.
-Wait a minute.

34:03.124 --> 34:08.003
l... l just wanted to let you know l was fine,
in case you're wondering.

34:08.337 --> 34:11.715
And now l have, so good night.

34:11.882 --> 34:16.261
l was going to call you,
and l should have called.

34:16.344 --> 34:21.183
Look, don't try to make me feel better, okay?
l mean, l don't care if you call me.

34:21.266 --> 34:22.516
ln fact, don't.

34:22.601 --> 34:25.520
Look, just don't try
to make me feel better, okay?

34:25.605 --> 34:27.022
Look, you want to come in?

34:28.315 --> 34:30.984
Dan, l may be easy, but l'm not stupid.

34:31.527 --> 34:35.072
Just for a minute. l missed you.

34:35.156 --> 34:38.324
-Just for a minute.
-No. Absolutely not.

35:04.644 --> 35:07.562
-You're so good.
-Yeah.

35:07.647 --> 35:11.108
-You are. You're the best.
-l bet you say that to all your guys.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.943
Yep, and they believe it.

35:16.864 --> 35:18.281
God, l love you...

35:20.076 --> 35:23.036
l love making love with you.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.831
l love making love with you, too.

35:28.334 --> 35:33.463
Are you getting serious?
l mean, she seemed like a hell of a girl.

35:33.548 --> 35:36.133
l mean, what little l saw of her.
You know, not too this, not too that.

35:36.217 --> 35:39.678
Very kind of... What?

35:42.473 --> 35:44.599
Well, what the fuck?
You know, l only saw her for a minute.

35:44.684 --> 35:47.936
l mean, first impressions of this kind
can often be misleading.

35:50.773 --> 35:53.191
-Does she give head?
-What?

35:53.276 --> 35:56.403
To you. l'm saying,
does she give head to you?

36:00.199 --> 36:01.616
Forget it.

36:10.459 --> 36:12.043
Don't look at me like that.

36:12.920 --> 36:16.298
Just get out of bed, you bum.

36:19.510 --> 36:22.262
Debbie, l've been thinking.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.514
For the last two months,
you've been running around town

36:24.599 --> 36:27.976
with your undies in a paper bag, and l...

36:28.060 --> 36:31.855
l think maybe you ought to have
a drawer over here.

36:31.939 --> 36:36.151
A drawer? A whole drawer?
l don't know, Dan.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.155
That's a pretty big step.
l think you better think about this.

36:40.239 --> 36:41.781
Take the drawer.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.534
-Are you sure? You positive?
-Come on.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.870
Okay, maybe just like a little small one
in the kitchen

36:46.954 --> 36:49.247
next to the utensils or something.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.708
-ls that okay?
-Stop it.

36:51.792 --> 36:54.211
Look at your divorce rate, Deborah.

36:54.295 --> 36:58.089
Men and women are fighting
for their lives, you know.

36:58.174 --> 37:01.843
You know, the sexes relate
in a very violent way. They do.

37:01.928 --> 37:05.680
And we're the ones who end up
giving up so much of ourselves.

37:05.765 --> 37:10.477
God. We lose so much along the way.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.646
-Come on, disagree with me.
-l disagree with you.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.899
lt is a dirty joke, Deborah,
the whole godforsaken business.

37:15.983 --> 37:18.818
-l disagree with you.
-You're right.

37:19.904 --> 37:22.739
So, are you gonna drink
that soda water or what?

37:26.202 --> 37:29.162
Perhaps l could have it.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.999
l'm moving in with Danny.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.837
l give you two months.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.799
Wait. Wait!

37:42.593 --> 37:45.345
All right. And what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

37:45.429 --> 37:47.722
-What?
-Some of those are Joan's.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.641
l'm sorry.
Here, do you want to separate them?

37:49.725 --> 37:52.477
Well, they're not going
to separate themselves now, are they?

37:52.561 --> 37:57.107
No, l don't suppose they are.
Here. ls this your Shostakovich?

37:57.191 --> 38:01.111
lt is Shos-ta-ko-vich. And it's mine.

38:02.196 --> 38:04.406
Great. What are we going to do
about the television set?

38:04.490 --> 38:07.492
-Why don't you keep it? l got a TV.
-Good for you.

38:07.576 --> 38:09.953
No, really, l insist on paying
for at least half of it.

38:10.037 --> 38:13.915
-So why don't l write you a check?
-That's fine. l'll just pick it up next week.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.377
When? Can you come by,
like, Tuesday night?

38:18.212 --> 38:22.465
-Can Debbie come by on Tuesday night?
-That's funny. That's good.

38:22.550 --> 38:25.885
Now if you could find it in your heart
to take this thing and shove it up your ass.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.804
That is very telling.

38:27.888 --> 38:32.142
l mean, on your instructions, l am supposed
to rend and torture myself anally.

38:32.226 --> 38:35.186
ls that what you're into?
Does Deborah know about this?

38:35.271 --> 38:38.106
-Look, you're moving out, so move out.
-She's moving out.

38:38.190 --> 38:42.152
She's moving out. Well, move her out, then,
and the hell with you!

38:42.236 --> 38:44.654
l hope you'll be very happy.

38:45.072 --> 38:46.489
Excuse me.

38:56.459 --> 38:57.625
-You got it? Sure?
-l got it.

38:57.710 --> 38:58.710
Okay. Fine.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.672
l got it. l got it. l know.

39:09.096 --> 39:10.138
That's it.

41:18.767 --> 41:22.937
-Do you want a cup of tea?
-Tea? No, thanks. l'm a coffee drinker.

41:23.022 --> 41:26.191
Come on, expand your horizons a little.

41:28.736 --> 41:30.153
l got it.

41:33.616 --> 41:34.824
-Hello.
-Danny?

41:34.909 --> 41:37.327
Hi, it's Alex.

41:37.411 --> 41:38.745
Long time no see.

41:39.580 --> 41:42.457
Yeah. Fine.

41:44.210 --> 41:46.294
ls this a bad time?

41:47.338 --> 41:50.089
No. No. No. l kind of met somebody.

41:50.799 --> 41:51.799
So?

41:52.551 --> 41:54.802
-So...
-Hey, listen, Dan.

41:54.887 --> 41:57.472
You think my husband and kids
are replicants?

41:57.598 --> 41:59.807
Hey, sweetheart, you know,
we all have to make sacrifices

41:59.892 --> 42:01.434
in our personal relationships.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.064
She's there.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.485
Well, give her a kiss from me.

42:10.903 --> 42:14.113
And, Dan, l'd like to leave you
with one final bit of advice.

42:15.074 --> 42:16.658
l'm in the book.

42:19.119 --> 42:22.580
To tell you the truth, we're living together.

42:22.665 --> 42:25.625
Yeah, and... Her name's Debbie.

42:27.586 --> 42:30.004
Thank you. l'll tell her.

42:31.006 --> 42:33.466
Same to you. Bye-bye.

42:36.845 --> 42:38.972
Don't tell me. Your cousin?

42:39.974 --> 42:42.016
Nah, that was my mom.

42:42.810 --> 42:46.062
Mom disappointed you won't be
sleeping with her anymore?

42:47.898 --> 42:49.857
lt was an old girlfriend.

42:50.484 --> 42:52.860
But it's... l mean, it's history.

42:52.945 --> 42:55.029
You heard me say it, right?

42:55.114 --> 42:58.825
lt's okay.
l guess l'll just have to get used to it.

43:01.495 --> 43:05.373
You know, what kind of tea is this?
'Cause it's actually pretty good.

43:05.457 --> 43:06.916
-l don't usually...
-What's going on here?

43:07.001 --> 43:08.876
Do you not want me here?

43:09.461 --> 43:11.921
Yeah, you're right. l don't.
l mean, we gave this our best shot,

43:12.006 --> 43:14.132
and it didn't work out.
But what the hell? We tried, right?

43:14.216 --> 43:16.217
l mean, this is nuts.

43:16.302 --> 43:19.846
l mean, we talked about this once
for what, 1 0 minutes in bed?

43:20.222 --> 43:21.806
lt's not all that complicated.

43:21.890 --> 43:25.101
lt's already different.
l mean, this changes everything.

43:26.353 --> 43:28.896
Things are gonna change a little bit.

43:28.981 --> 43:33.359
Look, we're not Siamese twins.
We're not gonna be fused at the hip.

43:33.444 --> 43:36.446
We're not talking about marriage, are we?

43:36.822 --> 43:39.532
-No.
-Well, then, all right.

43:39.992 --> 43:43.077
Look, you're gonna have your life
and your friends. l'm gonna have...

43:43.162 --> 43:47.081
You're always covered.
You always have just the right thing to say.

43:49.418 --> 43:52.545
What, do you think my responses
are programed?

43:54.506 --> 43:59.260
-You think l'm a replicant?
-Shit!

44:02.181 --> 44:05.099
What do you think you're doing?
Give me that!

44:06.727 --> 44:08.186
l'm sorry.

44:08.604 --> 44:10.980
l made this in Girl Scouts.

44:13.108 --> 44:15.401
lt's nice.

44:20.115 --> 44:22.408
lt was for my hope chest.

44:25.996 --> 44:26.996
Hey.

44:31.377 --> 44:33.628
This is our place.

44:36.840 --> 44:39.425
You're not an overnight guest anymore.

44:44.181 --> 44:45.765
Danny. Danny. Heads up.

44:46.892 --> 44:48.601
Who the hell is that?

44:48.769 --> 44:51.104
That's Carmen. She works in shipping.

44:51.438 --> 44:53.147
You see the look she just gave you?

44:53.232 --> 44:55.942
You just know
she's not wearing no underpants.

44:56.568 --> 45:00.029
Here she comes. Hi. How are you?

45:00.114 --> 45:02.240
Good to see you. This is Danny.

45:07.204 --> 45:09.455
So, how's what's-her-name?

45:09.581 --> 45:10.581
-Debbie.
-Debbie.

45:10.666 --> 45:12.542
-She's great.
-Yeah?

45:12.626 --> 45:16.504
What do you guys do?
What, go to the zoo? Go shopping?

45:17.965 --> 45:19.924
You know, she looks very intellectual.

45:20.008 --> 45:22.385
-l mean, that's not always a bad thing.
-No.

45:23.303 --> 45:25.221
l mean, what the fuck?
A guy wants to get it on with a broad

45:25.305 --> 45:28.266
on a more or less stable basis,
who's to say no, huh?

45:30.436 --> 45:33.980
A lot of these broads, you know,
you just don't know. You know?

45:34.106 --> 45:37.734
l mean, a young woman in today's society,
by the time she's 22, 23,

45:37.818 --> 45:39.986
you don't know where the fuck she's been.

45:42.030 --> 45:44.323
That's your business, right?

45:44.408 --> 45:48.161
Hey, hey, you guys. Go out, have lunch.
We're gonna make you a lot of money.

45:49.580 --> 45:52.582
Danny, l almost forgot.
l want you to shit-can the Sparrow.

45:52.833 --> 45:54.417
-You mean the Swallow?
-Yeah, yeah, whatever.

45:54.501 --> 45:56.294
Cut him off. No more credit.
The guy's two months behind.

45:56.378 --> 45:58.421
-No. He's a good guy...
-Danny, do me a favor, will you?

45:58.505 --> 46:00.631
He's a loser. Cut him off!

46:03.427 --> 46:06.512
David, pick up line two. lt's your mother.

46:06.597 --> 46:09.223
You know, for 600 bucks,
l can have that guy put to sleep.

46:10.100 --> 46:13.311
Please don't do this to me.
You're cutting my throat!

46:13.395 --> 46:15.813
Christ, Danny, how many years
do we go back, huh?

46:15.898 --> 46:18.441
l always paid. l never crapped out on you.

46:18.525 --> 46:20.234
l'll change the menu, Danny.

46:20.319 --> 46:23.321
Look at me. Look me in the face, would you?

46:23.405 --> 46:25.823
lt was my dad's place.

46:26.325 --> 46:27.784
Danny, l'm begging you.

46:27.868 --> 46:30.578
ln front of God, in front of the family,
in front of my neighborhood,

46:30.662 --> 46:34.165
l swear to you.
Danny, please, don't do this to me!

46:43.717 --> 46:45.718
l'm sorry, honey.

46:46.720 --> 46:49.180
lt's all right.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.059
ls everything okay?

46:54.937 --> 46:56.479
Sure.

46:57.272 --> 46:58.731
Are you sure?

47:00.234 --> 47:01.234
Sure.

47:02.152 --> 47:03.736
Are you okay?

47:04.571 --> 47:06.030
Sure.

47:08.242 --> 47:09.408
Okay.

47:21.463 --> 47:22.463
Dan?

47:23.131 --> 47:24.590
Dan, you up?

47:26.760 --> 47:28.177
Are you sleeping?

47:30.597 --> 47:32.056
You asleep?

47:35.060 --> 47:36.644
l can't sleep.

47:40.315 --> 47:43.776
You sleeping? Did l wake you?

47:47.489 --> 47:48.489
Dan?

48:06.341 --> 48:09.677
-Nose hair clippers.
-l didn't...

48:10.929 --> 48:13.723
-...know what...
-Nose hair.

48:13.807 --> 48:16.642
l'm sorry. l shouldn't be...

48:17.728 --> 48:19.145
l was snooping, and...

48:20.188 --> 48:24.150
-lt's okay.
-No, it's not right. lt's wrong.

48:25.319 --> 48:28.154
lt's wrong that l don't know you very well.

48:28.238 --> 48:32.116
l mean, l'm sneaking through your drawers
looking for pieces of l don't know what!

48:32.618 --> 48:34.619
l'm sorry.

48:35.037 --> 48:38.414
l just... This is wrong. Everything is wrong!

48:38.498 --> 48:40.124
What? What's wrong?

48:40.208 --> 48:42.627
l don't want to be your roommate anymore.

48:43.712 --> 48:46.547
-What?
-l had a roommate.

48:48.675 --> 48:52.845
l wanna be closer, you know?
l wanna be a couple.

48:53.472 --> 48:55.932
-And l want...
-We can do that.

48:56.016 --> 48:59.602
-l thought you said...
-l know what l said. l don't care what l said.

48:59.686 --> 49:02.730
You know? l just want to know you better.

49:03.774 --> 49:08.694
And when something's bothering you,
l want to know about it.

49:09.655 --> 49:13.491
You know? Because it's my problem, too.

49:13.575 --> 49:15.534
We can do that.

49:17.829 --> 49:22.166
-l just don't want you to be unhappy.
-l'm not unhappy.

49:23.877 --> 49:25.336
l'm not.

52:36.528 --> 52:38.904
l hope we didn't wake Mrs. Boelter.

52:38.989 --> 52:42.741
We can hear her screaming at the dog.
l know she can hear us.

52:50.167 --> 52:52.585
-Don't move.
-What?

52:53.086 --> 52:56.839
-You look so good in that light.
-What light?

52:57.299 --> 52:59.216
The light coming through the window.

53:00.093 --> 53:01.510
Get out of here.

53:05.599 --> 53:07.224
God, you are so beautiful.

53:08.643 --> 53:09.643
Danny.

53:10.937 --> 53:12.146
You are.

53:17.736 --> 53:19.153
l love you, Danny.

53:22.616 --> 53:24.783
l love you, too.

53:38.632 --> 53:41.300
Dan. Dan. Dan. Dan.

53:44.471 --> 53:47.223
-Who said it first?
-l did.

53:47.974 --> 53:50.476
Dan. Dan. Dan. Dan.

53:52.145 --> 53:54.605
Was it before you came or after?

53:59.986 --> 54:02.863
-Geez, that bathroom's so tiny.
-Was he home?

54:02.948 --> 54:06.408
-What?
-When you called. Was he home?

54:07.410 --> 54:10.913
No. That's okay. lt's sandwich night anyway.

54:12.374 --> 54:15.376
-Sandwich night?
-Yeah.

54:17.254 --> 54:20.881
Two nights a week, l cook.
Two nights a week, he cooks.

54:20.966 --> 54:25.719
Two nights, we go out.
And then there's sandwich night.

54:25.804 --> 54:29.306
You know, l bet your sex life is a real thrill.

54:29.391 --> 54:32.851
l mean, two nights a week, you're on top.
Two nights a week, he's on top.

54:32.936 --> 54:35.521
So what is it that you do on sandwich night?

54:40.777 --> 54:45.322
So, is this guy gonna marry you or what?

54:45.407 --> 54:49.285
Are you insane?
We don't talk about marriage.

54:49.369 --> 54:51.829
l mean, we don't talk about next week.

54:53.456 --> 54:56.709
We just don't talk about things.

54:59.254 --> 55:03.716
There's just stuff like that. You know?

55:10.390 --> 55:13.392
So, how about those Cubs, huh?

55:16.855 --> 55:18.272
Hi, honey.

55:24.070 --> 55:26.739
-ls something wrong?
-No, it's fine.

55:29.617 --> 55:31.702
Don't worry. You're not a daddy.

55:33.079 --> 55:35.247
l'm not? Was l?

55:35.915 --> 55:38.876
No, no, no. l was late and l was worried,

55:38.960 --> 55:43.505
so l just checked it out, and l'm not.
So relax.

55:44.049 --> 55:46.842
l thought we were being
really careful about this.

55:46.926 --> 55:49.928
We were. l was. l am.

55:50.847 --> 55:54.266
l was late and l was worried
that l was pregnant.

55:55.185 --> 55:59.271
-But you're not.
-No, l'm not.

56:01.608 --> 56:02.608
Okay.

56:03.193 --> 56:05.027
Great.

56:12.994 --> 56:16.330
-l'm sorry, honey.
-lt's no big deal.

56:18.958 --> 56:20.793
You look sad.

56:21.211 --> 56:22.795
l'm fine.

56:24.172 --> 56:27.633
-Were you disappointed?
-No. No.

56:29.010 --> 56:32.054
Honest to God, l didn't want to be pregnant.

56:33.348 --> 56:35.140
l just, you know...

56:35.725 --> 56:38.310
l was... l thought and...

56:42.357 --> 56:44.817
Well, maybe l am a little.

56:52.450 --> 56:53.617
You know what you are, Martin?

56:53.701 --> 56:56.203
You're a 14-karat fuckup,
that's what you are.

56:56.287 --> 56:57.371
Something wrong?

56:57.455 --> 56:59.957
Goddamn smart mouth.
Jesus, you got a mouth!

57:00.041 --> 57:02.793
You think people like that mouth?
You think customers like it?

57:02.877 --> 57:06.588
Mr. Big Shot. How come you didn't
cut off that dump on Canal Street?

57:06.673 --> 57:07.881
Swallow?

57:07.966 --> 57:11.677
l say "dump," he immediately
connects it with the Swallow.

57:11.761 --> 57:15.013
-You know what a swallow is?
-Let me guess, it's a bird.

57:15.098 --> 57:18.517
Yeah, it's a bird! A loser bird! A dodo!

57:18.601 --> 57:20.436
Hey, that guy threw a hell
of a lot of business our way.

57:20.520 --> 57:21.603
That's ancient history!

57:21.688 --> 57:25.190
-l told you to freeze him up!
-For Christ's sake, the guy has got a family.

57:25.275 --> 57:27.776
l got a family!
The whole country's full of families!

57:27.861 --> 57:30.779
But business is business!
You cut the son of a bitch off!

57:30.864 --> 57:33.073
-Fuck you!
-Fuck me? Fuck you!

57:33.158 --> 57:35.701
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you, Martin!

57:36.578 --> 57:38.162
-Mr. Favio?
-Fuck you!

57:38.455 --> 57:40.038
See you, boy.

57:42.333 --> 57:45.836
-Good morning, Officer.
-Top of the morning to you.

57:46.337 --> 57:47.921
Hi, there...

57:48.006 --> 57:49.882
Honey, l'll be home about 6:00.

57:49.966 --> 57:51.925
And l'm gonna go by the store
on my way home.

57:52.010 --> 57:55.220
Would you like me
to pick you up some beer or something?

57:58.016 --> 57:59.933
Are you gonna be okay?

58:01.811 --> 58:03.979
l hate that son of a bitch.

58:04.522 --> 58:06.899
lf you don't want to go back to work,
don't go.

58:06.983 --> 58:08.859
Honey, it's what l do.

58:09.319 --> 58:11.487
l have spent my life stuffing

58:11.571 --> 58:14.114
more unneeded restaurant supplies
on the shelves

58:14.199 --> 58:18.577
of more unneeded restaurants
than any other salesman in Chicago.

58:18.661 --> 58:22.080
l didn't finish college.
l don't have a million bucks.

58:22.165 --> 58:24.082
What am l gonna do?

58:24.167 --> 58:28.003
Three times l've heard you say that
you wanted to open up your own restaurant.

58:28.087 --> 58:29.713
How? With what?

58:29.797 --> 58:31.840
-You could go to a bank.
-Right.

58:31.925 --> 58:34.676
-You could.
-Honey, it's complicated.

58:34.761 --> 58:36.512
lt's not that complicated,

58:36.596 --> 58:40.098
and l'm making plenty of money
to tide us over.

58:49.108 --> 58:51.735
l'm sorry. l'm just trying to help.

58:59.702 --> 59:00.827
Hey.

59:01.454 --> 59:04.540
-Favio wants you back.
-Did he say he was sorry?

59:04.624 --> 59:06.458
What do you want, a fucking dozen roses?

59:06.543 --> 59:08.460
l should have decked him.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.796
You know, you're a lunatic.

59:10.880 --> 59:14.216
You know that? Six more years,
you have profit sharing, you're rich,

59:14.300 --> 59:16.218
you got Favio's job.

59:16.302 --> 59:18.971
Yeah, and then l'm plugging Mrs. Lyons

59:19.055 --> 59:21.223
and chewing the ass
of guys like you and me.

59:21.307 --> 59:24.726
Yeah, well, you didn't talk that shit
three months ago.

59:24.811 --> 59:28.814
Come on. What is it?
ls she pushing you to get out?

59:29.357 --> 59:30.816
What?

59:32.485 --> 59:36.363
-What did you say?
-l said, is she pushing you to get out?

59:36.447 --> 59:38.282
-Who?
-The permanent piece at home.

59:38.366 --> 59:40.742
-Bernie, don't start on her!
-Job isn't good enough for her, huh?

59:40.827 --> 59:43.495
-What the fuck's your problem?
-What the fuck's your problem, man?

59:43.580 --> 59:46.873
You don't go here, you don't go there.
You got no job!

59:46.958 --> 59:49.293
You're as much fun as a stick.

59:49.711 --> 59:53.130
l'd cut them off,
but, hey, it's your decision, man.

59:53.923 --> 59:56.216
l just wish you'd come back.

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:07.853
l miss you, man.

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:19.948
Hey, Dan!

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:21.867
Dan.

01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:26.747
Listen, l know you done
what you could, okay?

01:00:28.207 --> 01:00:29.666
Thanks.

01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:36.590
-Dan?
-ln here.

01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:41.970
Hi, honey.
Are you gonna go play basketball?

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:43.305
Yes.

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:45.807
Well, before you leave,
can l show you this...

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:48.226
Honey, do you think
you could clean up some of this shit?

01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:50.812
Okay.

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:54.566
-Did you get a turkey for tomorrow?
-No, l got a ham.

01:00:56.235 --> 01:00:59.321
You can't have a ham for Thanksgiving.
You gotta have a turkey.

01:00:59.405 --> 01:01:00.405
Well, there's only two of us,

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.866
unless you wanna be having
turkey sandwiches until Easter.

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:05.202
l told Bernie we'd have a turkey.

01:01:05.286 --> 01:01:08.497
-You asked Bernie?
-Yeah, he's my friend.

01:01:08.581 --> 01:01:10.707
-Well, then l'll ask Joan.
-Suit yourself.

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:13.377
No, l can't. lt'll be a nightmare.
They'll be at each other's throats.

01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:16.880
-Then don't invite her.
-No, l will. She's my friend.

01:01:16.964 --> 01:01:18.590
Suit yourself.

01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:23.929
Dan, l don't understand.
Did l do something wrong?

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:26.098
No, no.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:31.978
l went back to work today
with my goddamn tail between my legs.

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:34.773
Honey.

01:01:38.736 --> 01:01:41.154
-l'll leave you alone.
-Thank you.

01:02:19.193 --> 01:02:22.404
Look, l don't care what you did
or who you were with,

01:02:22.488 --> 01:02:23.864
or what the hell time you came in.

01:02:23.948 --> 01:02:27.075
l would've just appreciated a phone call
and maybe a little help today.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.535
Come on, l'm helping you.

01:02:28.619 --> 01:02:32.497
-And l'm hung way over. So shoot me.
-Don't tempt me, please.

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.499
Besides, they're not gonna be able
to eat all of this.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:38.086
You shouldn't put yourself out
on Bernie's account.

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:40.422
lt's for Joan, too. My friend.

01:02:40.506 --> 01:02:42.674
Could you please put the cranberry sauce
in that dish?

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:45.635
All of these airs and graces are for Joan.

01:02:46.387 --> 01:02:48.388
No, it's for both of them.

01:02:48.806 --> 01:02:52.434
At least Joan's used to sitting down
while she eats.

01:02:52.518 --> 01:02:55.771
Yeah, yeah, she's a real lady, that one.

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:57.773
Look, you want me to make Bernie
feel right at home?

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:01.651
l'll serve him a fistful of white bread
and a hunk of Velveeta, okay?

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:06.448
Hey, he is a better human being than
that bitch on wheels you've got for a friend.

01:03:06.532 --> 01:03:09.075
You know, she's been trying
to sabotage us from day one.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.162
And Bernie's been really
full of comfort and support.

01:03:12.246 --> 01:03:15.999
He hates my guts, and l'm busting my ass
cooking this seven-course meal for him.

01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:17.793
l did all the hard stuff.

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:20.128
-You did not!
-l did, too.

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:23.131
-Danny, please! You did not!
-l did, too!

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:25.801
l made the mashed potatoes.
l made the stuffing.

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:27.636
l did the salad. You cooked the turkey.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.515
You son of a bitch!
l did all the shopping, all the preparation.

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:34.226
l mean, look at this goddamn spread!

01:03:44.278 --> 01:03:45.987
-Joanie!
-Hi.

01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:51.159
God, she looks great.
And she baked us a pie. That's terrific.

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:56.289
Your vulgarian friend is downstairs
denting innocent people's fenders.

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.086
Yo, Litko!

01:04:05.216 --> 01:04:06.633
Nice feed.

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:13.265
You know, Dan, you got a terrific little
homemaker there. You know that?

01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:20.689
And there goes the gun
ending the first half of this...

01:04:20.773 --> 01:04:23.024
Hey. Guess who's been asking about you
down at shipping?

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:24.317
-Carmen?
-Carmen.

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:25.569
-Yeah, what did she say?
-Yeah.

01:04:25.653 --> 01:04:28.113
Come on, man, l can't tell you.
You're practically a married man.

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:29.698
Come on, what did she say?

01:04:29.782 --> 01:04:34.953
Basically, she has this desire
to grab yourjoint! She wants your...

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:37.038
Shut up. Touchdown!

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:40.125
Touchdown! No, no, no. Touch! Touchdown!

01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:46.631
Well, it's official. l've become my mother.

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:50.427
-So, did he help at all?
-Hardly. l hate this spoon.

01:04:50.511 --> 01:04:53.430
So, let me tell you about Gary.

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:59.269
He's tall. He's nice to me.

01:04:59.353 --> 01:05:02.147
He's intelligent,

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:05.692
and he doesn't make me sleep
in the wet spot.

01:05:05.776 --> 01:05:07.819
lt's a trick. l bet he's a shit.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:11.990
No, really, l think that he is truly concerned
with my happiness.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:14.492
Good. Then he'll be a big help next year

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:17.245
when we all come to your house
for Thanksgiving.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:20.707
Well, now, he's already asked me out
for New Year's.

01:05:20.791 --> 01:05:24.544
And did l mention that he is a lawyer?
Nothing.

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:27.088
l have to meet him at Yvette's
in a half an hour,

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:30.050
so what do you say we smoke this now?

01:05:31.677 --> 01:05:35.722
God, l haven't been stoned in ages.

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:38.516
He doesn't like to smoke.

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:43.104
That's probably why l haven't been stoned.
Good, Deb.

01:05:54.408 --> 01:05:56.493
Do l seem different to you?

01:06:00.081 --> 01:06:03.458
All l'm saying is that maid service
is not included in the package.

01:06:03.542 --> 01:06:07.128
And if you want to put on
this little domestic show in the future,

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:10.006
be ready to handle the weight, okay?

01:06:11.592 --> 01:06:13.301
-Okay?
-Okay.

01:06:13.886 --> 01:06:15.178
l should have, but l didn't.

01:06:15.262 --> 01:06:17.806
But l'm not always gonna do what you want,
when you want,

01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:20.183
according to your grand plan
of the way things should be.

01:06:20.267 --> 01:06:24.479
-l don't have any grand plan.
-Who invented sandwich night?

01:06:24.563 --> 01:06:27.774
That has nothing to do with this.
All l'm asking for is a little help.

01:06:27.858 --> 01:06:29.526
Yeah, because you tried
to turn this nice dinner

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:32.445
into a goddamn Norman Rockwell painting.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.157
Would you please not put this on
the counter? You see this black stuff?

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:39.327
This gets in the little cracks in the porcelain,
and then l get it on my fingers.

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:40.829
l'll make an effort.

01:06:40.913 --> 01:06:44.708
And would you make an effort to please
put these wrappers in the trashcan?

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:46.001
Or why don't you just flush them?

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:48.003
-What?
-Flush them!

01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:50.213
You want me to waste eight gallons of water

01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:52.007
so that you don't have to look at
a piece of paper

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:53.842
with the word "Tampax" written on it?

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:56.386
You didn't even say "Tampax."
You had to say "those wrappers."

01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:57.595
Does it offend you that much?

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:01.307
No, l just want you to hit the trashcan
or the toilet, not the floor.

01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:03.351
Fine. l'll work on my dunk shot.

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.937
What l'm trying to say to you
is you don't need a lot of this shit.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.856
l think you look pretty the way you are.

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:12.027
No. You look great just the way you are.
Some of us have to work at it.

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:14.029
Why do you wear all this stuff?

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:16.114
-To impress your boss?
-No.

01:07:17.158 --> 01:07:20.869
You know that Bernie says
Joan says you go out with him.

01:07:20.953 --> 01:07:24.039
l used to go out with him.
lt's no big secret, for God's sake.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:26.541
lt's no big secret?
Then how come l didn't know about it?

01:07:26.625 --> 01:07:27.876
Well, maybe you never asked.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:32.130
-Okay, l'm asking. Did you sleep with him?
-No, Dan, we were bowling partners.

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:35.550
So you fucked him
and you see him every goddamn day?

01:07:35.634 --> 01:07:39.387
-That's just fucking great!
-Hey, you know that l'm not sleeping around!

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:40.764
And if that's what you wanna do,

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:43.141
then why don't you have the balls
to just come out and say it?

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:45.101
Hey! Hey!

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:48.146
-Where are you going?
-l'm not staying here.

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:50.732
No, you stay here. l'll leave.

01:07:50.816 --> 01:07:52.567
Don't be ridiculous. You live here.

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:55.320
We live here! We live here!

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.324
Debbie!

01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:14.297
He is not worth it, you know?

01:08:14.381 --> 01:08:18.176
-l hate that number they play.
-Establishing dominance?

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:22.764
l feel like a fire hydrant
that's been pissed on.

01:08:22.848 --> 01:08:24.265
Well, maybe it's job-related.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.267
l mean, the man does sell toilet paper
for a living.

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:29.354
-Joan, please. Don't.
-All right, all right.

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:34.442
l just... l just don't know what l'm doing.

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:40.657
l feel like we're a couple of kids
playing house.

01:08:42.576 --> 01:08:45.328
l mean, what's it supposed to be like?

01:08:45.703 --> 01:08:48.957
Look, holidays...
Holidays are hard on some guys.

01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:54.962
That's not it. l used the big "L" word.

01:08:55.046 --> 01:08:58.508
You see?
You tell someone that you love them,

01:08:58.591 --> 01:09:00.926
and all you get is a headache.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:05.140
-What's going on?
-l have someone l want you to meet.

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:09.060
-Deborah?
-Yeah. Gary.

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:13.231
Pleased to meet you. Excuse the attire.

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:16.609
She's had a blowout with her boyfriend.

01:09:17.944 --> 01:09:21.156
Hey, guys can be real assholes sometimes.

01:09:21.948 --> 01:09:25.702
Why don't you get a good night's sleep,
and it'll all get fixed up in the morning.

01:09:25.786 --> 01:09:27.537
He'll come around.

01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:31.082
And if he doesn't,
you can always move back in here.

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:22.008
"And then an angel of the Lord
descended upon the Virgin Mary..."

01:10:22.092 --> 01:10:24.093
What's "descended"?

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:28.139
Came down from out of the sky.

01:10:29.808 --> 01:10:34.729
"And then an angel of the Lord
descended upon the Virgin Mary..."

01:10:34.813 --> 01:10:36.522
What's a virgin?

01:10:39.985 --> 01:10:44.656
A virgin is someone who has never had sex.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.699
What's sex?

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:53.289
Sex?
Sex is how men and women make babies.

01:10:53.707 --> 01:10:55.792
Are you a virgin?

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:58.086
No.

01:10:58.170 --> 01:11:00.338
So, you have a baby?

01:11:02.007 --> 01:11:03.549
No.

01:11:03.634 --> 01:11:08.263
Men and women who don't want babies
also have sex.

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:11.849
-What for?
-For about 1 0 or 1 5 minutes.

01:11:13.143 --> 01:11:15.311
"And then an angel of the Lord..."

01:11:15.896 --> 01:11:20.358
And Santa Claus
came down the chimney and...

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:25.029
Dan! Dan, hold on a second!
l'll be right back, all right?

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:29.951
Dan, Dan, come here.
l got this broad that's dying to meet you.

01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:31.786
Come here, come here.

01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:35.039
This is Carmen. This is Danny.

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:38.710
-Hi, Danny.
-Hi.

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:43.673
Bernie says you might want
to go out dancing later on. Like, what time?

01:11:45.217 --> 01:11:48.803
l'm sorry.
l'm gonna have to take a rain check tonight.

01:11:50.055 --> 01:11:52.557
Wait, wait right here. Dan. Dan!

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.726
Come on, come dancing. Come dance,

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:57.061
and we'll go over to my place,
have a little party.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.105
Play "spin the pickle." Come on.

01:11:59.189 --> 01:12:02.358
Bernie, l can't.
There's been tension at home.

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:05.862
l'm sorry about that, Dan.

01:12:05.946 --> 01:12:09.741
But this Carmen's a sure thing.
She's hot, hot, hot.

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:12.744
She'll grab yourjoint on the dance floor.

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:15.580
Merry Christmas, Bernie.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.709
Yeah. Merry Christmas, Danny.

01:12:20.919 --> 01:12:23.629
Alan, my friend. Alan, how are you?

01:12:27.092 --> 01:12:31.054
Merry Christmas to you, too.
Would you hold this for me, please?

01:12:31.138 --> 01:12:32.472
-l'll just set it on your desk.
-All right.

01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:33.973
Thank you.

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:45.443
Hey there.

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:50.239
-Don't you ever think about me anymore?
-Sure.

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:54.202
What we had was pretty good, wasn't it?

01:12:56.121 --> 01:12:57.622
lt was fine.

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:01.876
Do you remember last year's party,
what we did when we came in here?

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.711
Steve, don't. Just... Just turn on the light.

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:06.214
l had to stuff a mitten in your mouth
to keep you from laughing.

01:13:06.298 --> 01:13:08.007
God damn it, Steve!

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:10.968
-What?
-Look, there's somebody else now.

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:12.929
Well, you're not married. l don't see a ring.

01:13:13.013 --> 01:13:16.766
l don't need a ring!
l don't need a ring, you asshole.

01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:21.312
Look at me. Don't l look different?
l mean, l'm in love. Can't you tell?

01:13:22.147 --> 01:13:24.399
l mean, this has never
happened to me before.

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:29.112
l want to have 1 0 kids with this guy.
l mean, Jesus, doesn't it show?

01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:32.782
Does he love you?

01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:36.828
l don't know.

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:41.999
Thanks.

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:44.335
Good luck.

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:49.173
-Here you go.
-Hi, honey.

01:13:51.385 --> 01:13:54.679
This is my boss, Steve. This is Dan.

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:56.097
-Hey, come on, take it easy!
-Dan!

01:13:56.181 --> 01:13:59.434
Take it easy. lt's all right. lt's all right.

01:13:59.518 --> 01:14:01.018
Take it easy.

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:37.823
This is great, hon. Lots of fun.

01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:41.494
-Here, let me get that for you.
-Thank you.

01:15:41.578 --> 01:15:46.040
-You look very elegant in that suit.
-Thank you. My girlfriend picked it out.

01:15:46.124 --> 01:15:48.125
-She did?
-Yes.

01:15:54.466 --> 01:15:59.762
To you, to me, to us,
and to a happy new year.

01:16:12.985 --> 01:16:14.694
Do you like it?

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.697
l used pecans in the dressing.

01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:19.699
Pecans.

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:30.167
-Hello?
-Hello, Danny? This is Bernie.

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:34.005
Are you with your girl?
Get your ass down to Mother's now.

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:40.845
-Bernie?
-What's left of him. He's at Mother's.

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:45.850

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:07.204
Yeah.

01:17:15.547 --> 01:17:19.133
-Yo, Danny, over here!

01:17:19.217 --> 01:17:21.385

Crystal, this is Debbie.

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:42.448
-Hi.
-Show her your tattoo.

01:17:42.532 --> 01:17:44.575
-Danny, come on, let's get a drink.
-Okay, okay.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.994
Okay, l'm gonna be the Refrigerator.
You be Payton.

01:17:47.079 --> 01:17:49.372
Come on! Come on!

01:17:49.456 --> 01:17:51.415
Danny, dance with me.

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:56.379
Hey, Deb!

01:18:01.593 --> 01:18:04.178
-You look great.
-So do you.

01:18:05.555 --> 01:18:06.764
Hi.

01:18:18.402 --> 01:18:20.236
Yeah!

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:27.243
-So, let's go.
-What?

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:44.635
God, l bet you're terrific.

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:47.722
And l know l am.

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:50.099
You know, maybe someday we'll find out.

01:18:50.183 --> 01:18:53.144
One, two, three. Drop it!

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:55.730
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Now! Now!

01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:01.652
Hi.

01:19:02.028 --> 01:19:06.449
Hi, good to see you again.
l've been waiting all night to see you.

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:10.411
-How about now?
-Right here? No.

01:19:10.495 --> 01:19:12.705
-Yeah, right here and now.
-Well... Yeah, l...

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:17.501
-Look, l couldn't tell you.
-What?

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.336
l just couldn't tell you before.

01:19:19.504 --> 01:19:23.674
-Just one little kiss.
-A New Year's kiss? One New Year's kiss?

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:27.011
Okay, one New Year's kiss.

01:19:35.228 --> 01:19:37.438
-What?
-Joan, please. Please. Now, calm down!

01:19:37.522 --> 01:19:39.106
-Joan, please! l care about you.
-Get away from me!

01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:40.274
-l don't wanna lose you!
-Let me get by!

01:19:40.358 --> 01:19:41.567
-Get away from me!
-Please, Joan. Listen...

01:19:41.651 --> 01:19:44.528
-You are a son of a bitch!
-Joan, please! Joan, please.

01:19:45.363 --> 01:19:48.032
Get away from me. You stay away from me.

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:50.743
-Let me through!
-Joan.

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:58.876
Joan. What's wrong?

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:02.546
-What happened?
-What the hell do you care?

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.882
l care a lot. l'm sorry.

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:08.552
-l haven't been a very good friend lately.
-Very perceptive.

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:12.681
-What? Will you just let me in? Please...
-Nothing! Will you just leave me alone?

01:20:12.766 --> 01:20:15.726
-Just give us a minute, okay?
-l am such a fool.

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:20.231
Tell me. Tell me what's going on.
l'm your best friend.

01:20:20.315 --> 01:20:23.400
He's going back with his wife.

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:27.571
-l didn't even know he was married.
-Neither did l.

01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:33.536
Come here.

01:20:35.413 --> 01:20:36.747
Honey.

01:20:37.749 --> 01:20:40.751
Go, go, go! Come on, chug it!
Chug it, Bernie! Chug, chug!

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:43.337
-l can't drink any more champagne.
-You win.

01:20:43.421 --> 01:20:44.755
-l won. l won.
-Danny!

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.924
-l cannot...
-Danny! Danny.

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:48.843
-What?
-l'm gonna take Joan home.

01:20:48.927 --> 01:20:52.388
-lt's almost midnight.
-Look, she's really a mess.

01:20:52.472 --> 01:20:54.723
She does this every goddamn time.

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:56.934
She falls apart, so you gotta take care of her.

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:58.853
Gary just dumped her.

01:20:58.937 --> 01:21:03.065
Proving to herself, once again,
that all men are selfish bastards.

01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:04.149
That's not fair.

01:21:04.234 --> 01:21:07.444
Hey, that broad don't know thing one
about keeping a guy happy.

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:10.322
l mean, l'm surprised the guy
didn't leave skid marks.

01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:13.367
-Honey, why don't you put her in a cab?
-Because it's New Year's Eve.

01:21:13.451 --> 01:21:18.122
You know what? Give the cabbie 50 bucks
and maybe she'll get a New Year's pop.

01:21:18.206 --> 01:21:20.833
Sometimes you're funny.
Sometimes you're just slime!

01:21:20.917 --> 01:21:22.626
Don't you see a pattern here?

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:26.755
She sets him up, she puts her hooks in him,
and he tries for daylight,

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:29.383
and he's a bad guy, he's the asshole.

01:21:29.467 --> 01:21:31.760
No. You're the asshole!

01:21:33.513 --> 01:21:35.973
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:38.392
-Wait a minute. Danny, come here!
-Come back here!

01:21:38.643 --> 01:21:41.645
Hey! Hey!
What the hell was that all about back there?

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.522
Look, she's in trouble. She needs me.

01:21:43.607 --> 01:21:47.526
-What kind of answer is that? l need you.
-For what? To help you have a good time?

01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:51.113
A good time. When was the last time
we had a good time?

01:21:51.197 --> 01:21:52.698
Dan, just go back to your friends in the bar.

01:21:52.782 --> 01:21:55.743
The hooks are out.
You better run for daylight.

01:21:55.827 --> 01:21:58.078
Come back! Debbie!

01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:01.832
That's... That's great! Well, Happy New Year!

01:22:14.804 --> 01:22:16.805
-Dan?
-ln here.

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:38.619
l'm sorry. lt's just not working out, is it?

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:42.373
Here we go.

01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:48.629
-Just say it, Dan.
-What?

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:53.592
Just say what you're gonna say.

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:09.483
l think one of us should move out.

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:16.573
l do, too.

01:23:19.285 --> 01:23:22.871
-l'm sorry.
-What?

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:27.376
-l said l'm sorry.
-For what? What are you sorry for?

01:23:29.754 --> 01:23:32.548
l'm sorry that it didn't work out.

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:36.135
l need some time.

01:23:36.219 --> 01:23:39.263
What? What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

01:23:40.181 --> 01:23:43.559
You know, you started out real strong,
and now you're finishing like a wimp.

01:23:43.643 --> 01:23:45.769
Why didn't you just quit
while you were ahead?

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:50.274
-Yeah, that's what l'm trying to do.
-Good. Let's see your face on that one.

01:23:53.611 --> 01:23:55.195
Do you mind?

01:23:55.947 --> 01:23:59.783
Good. Because l think
we've been in the dark long enough.

01:24:10.462 --> 01:24:15.090
l know why l'm leaving.
What's your story? What killed it for you?

01:24:15.175 --> 01:24:19.720
The radical change in your lifestyle?
Decided you wanted to travel light?

01:24:19.804 --> 01:24:21.305
Come on, Debbie.

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:24.391
Or is it just that you were afraid
that somebody better might come along

01:24:24.476 --> 01:24:25.893
and you would be stuck with me?

01:24:25.977 --> 01:24:27.686
Look, why can't you just see this
for what it is?

01:24:27.771 --> 01:24:31.732
-And what is it?
-What it is. Nothing more, nothing less.

01:24:31.816 --> 01:24:35.110
What, two people committed to screwing
until they get sick of each other?

01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:37.112
That's so great. That's really special.

01:24:37.197 --> 01:24:41.492
Look, l don't want marriage.
l don't want kids.

01:24:42.994 --> 01:24:45.454
l don't want to be tied down.

01:24:49.459 --> 01:24:51.335
l'm not happy.

01:24:52.545 --> 01:24:54.671
l don't

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.716
love you anymore.

01:25:04.516 --> 01:25:05.974
Fine.

01:25:07.519 --> 01:25:09.812
l'm gone. lt's done.

01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:14.274
And you can go back to doing
whatever you want to do,

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:18.946
with whoever you want to do it with,
in whatever orifice you want to do it in.

01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:21.406
Hey, you leave here knowing one thing.

01:25:21.491 --> 01:25:24.618
l never fooled around. Not once!

01:25:24.702 --> 01:25:28.413
Well, let's just give the boy a medal.
Forgive me.

01:25:28.498 --> 01:25:31.875
l didn't realize it was such a sacrifice!

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:24.803
Are you okay?

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.389
Can you make arrangements
not to be here tomorrow

01:26:27.473 --> 01:26:30.559
so that l can pick up the rest of my things?

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.943
God, honey, l hope you find him someday.

01:27:14.687 --> 01:27:17.022
l told you you'd be back on your feet
in a couple of weeks.

01:27:17.106 --> 01:27:19.691
-You know what? l like women.
-Yeah.

01:27:19.776 --> 01:27:21.944
l like all kinds of women.

01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:25.405
But l especially like women l don't know

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.574
-very well!
-Very well!

01:27:27.659 --> 01:27:30.285
He's back! He's happening!

01:27:37.502 --> 01:27:40.754
This... This is the place. This is the place.

01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:43.048
Tonight we ride!

01:27:43.132 --> 01:27:48.220
Bartender, a bottle of your best cognac
and fresh horses for the men!

01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:53.058
You know,
l have a little confession to make.

01:27:53.142 --> 01:27:55.018
Well, actually, when lra first told me

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:58.230
that he was gonna be fixing me up
with Joan's best friend,

01:27:58.314 --> 01:28:01.233
well, l was a tad apprehensive. l mean...

01:28:01.317 --> 01:28:04.945
You know how bloody awful
these things can be, right?

01:28:05.029 --> 01:28:07.531
Well, l was not the least bit prepared for her

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:10.617
to be such a charming
and delightful creature.

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:12.619
Thank you. You're very sweet.

01:28:12.704 --> 01:28:14.955
And that accent.

01:28:15.039 --> 01:28:18.166
Couldn't you just listen to him
all night long?

01:28:19.585 --> 01:28:23.213
Colin's too bashful to mention it,
but he happens to be a wiz at card tricks.

01:28:23.298 --> 01:28:26.425
God, lra, don't put me on the spot like that.

01:28:27.385 --> 01:28:30.429
Those are exquisite earrings you have there.

01:28:32.432 --> 01:28:33.473
Where did this come from?

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:36.893
Did you know that was up there
when you left the house this evening?

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:50.240
l'm going home.

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:53.910
-Good night, Danny.
-Good night.

01:29:05.465 --> 01:29:09.176
Good morning to you
Good morning to you

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:11.803
God. l had such a wonderful time
last night, didn't you?

01:29:11.888 --> 01:29:15.265
l knew you would. You were so good.
l've got breakfast in the oven.

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:17.642
l made a soufflÃ©. l hope you like soufflÃ©s.

01:29:17.727 --> 01:29:19.478
And l talked to my mother,

01:29:19.562 --> 01:29:21.938
and she said that
she would have us for dinner...

01:29:32.283 --> 01:29:36.745
You know...

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:55.806
Are we doing it here because it's exotic,

01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:59.101
or are you having your place
bombed for roaches?

01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:08.777
Do you live around here?

01:30:08.861 --> 01:30:11.321
Yeah? What do you say we go over there?

01:30:23.167 --> 01:30:26.962
-l'm sorry.
-Are you going in?

01:30:28.506 --> 01:30:30.799
l really like you a lot.

01:30:41.769 --> 01:30:44.104
-l can't do this.
-What?

01:30:44.188 --> 01:30:48.817
l have my eyes closed,
and l'm thinking you're somebody else.

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:52.362
l'm really sorry.

01:30:53.823 --> 01:30:55.615
What am l gonna do?

01:30:56.409 --> 01:30:59.578
Wait! You didn't close?

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:03.373
ls that what you're telling me?
You didn't close?

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:05.792
You leave a classy chick like that
just hanging?

01:31:05.877 --> 01:31:07.377
l don't know.

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:12.174
Tits and ass! Tits and ass! Tits and ass!
Tits and ass! Tits and ass!

01:31:12.341 --> 01:31:15.218
Bloody blue, bloody blue,
bloody blue, bloody blue.

01:31:17.263 --> 01:31:20.140
-l don't know.
-So don't know!

01:31:20.224 --> 01:31:22.726
So, what, are you gonna sell your birthright
for a little bit of puss?

01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:24.936
-Hey, you better back off!
-Hey, l'm backed.

01:31:25.021 --> 01:31:27.314
You back off 'cause she was the best thing
that ever happened to me!

01:31:27.398 --> 01:31:30.650
-She was the best fuck you ever had, man!
-And l fucked it completely! Why is that?

01:31:30.735 --> 01:31:32.694
-Because you're thinking with your dick!
-She was perfect!

01:31:32.778 --> 01:31:34.196
-No, l loved her!
-Perfect shit, man!

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:37.407
l love her! Don't you understand?
l still love her!

01:31:39.243 --> 01:31:42.704
Yeah, l understand.

01:31:43.915 --> 01:31:47.292
l understand, Dan. l do.

01:31:47.376 --> 01:31:50.086
You know, this babe last night, now,

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:53.423
you got her number or what?

01:31:54.926 --> 01:31:57.344
-Christ, you got problems.
-Dan!

01:31:58.471 --> 01:32:02.098
Dan! Don't ever lose
your sense of humor, Dan!

01:32:02.475 --> 01:32:05.644
Don't ever lose your sense of humor!

01:32:21.577 --> 01:32:25.080
-Hello?
-Hey, stranger. How's it going?

01:32:28.084 --> 01:32:31.378
Boy, we have a bad connection.
l can barely hear you.

01:32:31.462 --> 01:32:33.838
Maybe we better talk over lunch.

01:32:33.923 --> 01:32:37.884
-You're serious?
-Yeah, l am. Can you hang on for a second?

01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:44.182
l'm sorry.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:48.562
l don't know what l was trying to figure out.

01:32:48.646 --> 01:32:51.648
These last couple weeks
have been miserable.

01:32:52.650 --> 01:32:55.860
l can't stand going out.
l can't stand being at home

01:32:55.945 --> 01:32:58.196
because it reminds me of you.

01:32:59.490 --> 01:33:00.615
l can't work.

01:33:01.367 --> 01:33:04.536
Everything is falling apart,
because l miss you.

01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:08.290
l need to see you again.

01:33:08.833 --> 01:33:11.293
All right. l'll send you a picture.

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:17.173
Debbie, please. Come on, l...
lf you just give me one more chance...

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:22.679
Dan, l don't want you ever
to bother me again, okay?

01:33:50.583 --> 01:33:52.042
Nice legs.

01:33:56.172 --> 01:33:58.673
Hey, are you sure you want to be here?

01:33:58.758 --> 01:34:00.842
lt's St. Patrick's Day.

01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:06.097
So, guess who l bumped into
at the supermarket?

01:34:06.682 --> 01:34:08.224
St. Patrick?

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:11.061
l see we took our happy pill today.

01:34:11.604 --> 01:34:12.896
Danny.

01:34:13.731 --> 01:34:18.443
He said hello to me. Naturally, l ignored him.
So guess what he does?

01:34:18.527 --> 01:34:23.073
He starts screaming at the top of his lungs,
"Hello! Hello!"

01:34:23.616 --> 01:34:28.453
Like a lunatic. l got the hell out of there.
l am sorry. That guy is a maniac.

01:34:30.581 --> 01:34:34.918
You don't suppose that he was,
like, hitting on me, do you?

01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:39.297
No. l mean, to get back at you,
that sort of thing.

01:34:40.049 --> 01:34:41.925
Speak of the devil.

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:48.598
Would you stop following me around?

01:34:48.683 --> 01:34:50.475
l don't wanna have to start drinking
in the suburbs.

01:34:50.559 --> 01:34:53.728
-l love you.
-Let's not get corny, please.

01:34:55.398 --> 01:34:57.607
-l love you.
-l'm going home.

01:34:58.234 --> 01:34:59.651
Deb. Wait.

01:35:03.447 --> 01:35:05.532
Just get away from me
or l'm gonna call the cops!

01:35:05.616 --> 01:35:07.242
l love you!

01:35:07.326 --> 01:35:09.202
Five months we were together,
and you couldn't say it!

01:35:09.286 --> 01:35:12.372
-So just knock it off!
-l said it! l did say it!

01:35:12.456 --> 01:35:16.668
-Once. Once, but you didn't even mean it!
-l did mean it! l love you!

01:35:16.752 --> 01:35:19.087
-lt'll pass.
-No, it won't!

01:35:19.171 --> 01:35:22.882
-l miss you. l miss what we had.
-We had nothing.

01:35:22.967 --> 01:35:25.635
That's not true. lt was the best.

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.554
We had nothing.

01:35:27.638 --> 01:35:31.391
-We had good sex.
-Don't say that.

01:35:32.643 --> 01:35:34.102
l love you.

01:35:34.937 --> 01:35:38.398
Bullshit. You don't know what love is.

01:35:38.858 --> 01:35:41.151
You've gotten everything
that you've always wanted.

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:42.610
And now you feel sorry for yourself

01:35:42.695 --> 01:35:44.988
because there's something you want,
and you can't have it.

01:35:45.072 --> 01:35:49.409
But you had it. l gave you love.
But you asked me to leave, and l left.

01:35:49.493 --> 01:35:53.037
Debbie, let's talk about it.
Can't we have a cup of coffee?

01:35:53.122 --> 01:35:57.375
Dan, it's taken me a long time
to get over this.

01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:00.003
And it was so hard, but l did it.

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:02.881
-Please? Please?
-Dan.

01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:06.301
Get on with your life. lt's over.

01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:25.964
Mr. Martin, so nice of you to show up.
The prince of the plates is here, Litko.

01:37:26.048 --> 01:37:28.842
-lsn't that great? Welcome.
-How are you?

01:37:42.648 --> 01:37:45.316
Hey, Vic, come on, guy,
where are you going?

01:37:45.401 --> 01:37:47.986
This is the way out. Come on.
We're gonna get you home, guy.

01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:50.488
Stevie, get him a cab, huh?

01:37:50.573 --> 01:37:54.367
-Give me a gin and tonic.
-Last call was a half-hour ago.

01:37:54.451 --> 01:37:56.911
Give me a gin and tonic, or l will kill you.

01:37:56.996 --> 01:37:58.454
Just one.

01:38:02.251 --> 01:38:05.587
You know, l've been wanting to do this
my whole life.

01:38:05.671 --> 01:38:09.132
l'd like to buy the house
a round of drinks, Mother.

01:38:09.216 --> 01:38:14.012
To think l didn't think that you didn't
have a decent bone in your entire body.

01:38:14.096 --> 01:38:15.722
Hey, you wanna leave my bone out of this?

01:38:15.806 --> 01:38:18.057
-You are a filthy scumbag.
-Thank you.

01:38:18.142 --> 01:38:20.685
And you dress for shit.
Who dresses you in the morning?

01:38:20.769 --> 01:38:22.729
Here you go, guys.

01:38:22.813 --> 01:38:25.982
A toast to Danny and Debbie.

01:38:31.822 --> 01:38:34.782
-Well, they're better off anyway.
-Fucking A.

01:38:34.867 --> 01:38:37.201
-l mean, she's happy, right?
-Ecstatic.

01:38:37.286 --> 01:38:38.912
Well, so is he.

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:42.874
l'll bet you she starts
banging her boss again.

01:38:42.958 --> 01:38:45.251
l bet he catches a disease.

01:38:46.712 --> 01:38:48.338
You know what, Joan?

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:51.966
lf you didn't have a pussy, there'd be
a bounty on your head. You know that?

01:38:52.051 --> 01:38:57.889
And you are a psychopathic, schizophrenic,
maladjusted, social misfit

01:38:57.973 --> 01:39:02.435
who is clearly in the middle
of a very deep homosexual panic.

01:39:02.519 --> 01:39:04.270
Yeah, yeah, right.

01:39:05.356 --> 01:39:07.732
So, you want to dance or what?

01:40:02.413 --> 01:40:05.748
-Yo, check this.
-l love it.

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:09.252
To you, this is culture. To me, it's soda pop.

01:40:11.547 --> 01:40:16.009
You know, everyone said you were dead.
They said, "Dan is dead."

01:40:16.093 --> 01:40:19.721
l said, "No, no, no. He was my best friend.

01:40:20.389 --> 01:40:22.557
"He would have called me for the funeral."

01:40:22.641 --> 01:40:23.933
Hello, Litko.

01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:27.270
All right, shut up now.
You cut the small talk, all right?

01:40:28.731 --> 01:40:30.273
Now, l got a deal for you.

01:40:30.357 --> 01:40:33.526
l got you here some tall fountain glasses.

01:40:33.610 --> 01:40:35.611
-Where did you find those?
-You like that?

01:40:35.696 --> 01:40:38.156
l got you matching banana boats.

01:40:38.907 --> 01:40:41.200
And will you take a fucking look at this?

01:40:41.285 --> 01:40:47.040
This shitload of Fiestaware, all yours,
with the low, low, low, low Litko discount.

01:40:47.666 --> 01:40:51.461
-Yeah. How much?
-Yeah, l don't know. 1 00% off.

01:40:52.212 --> 01:40:55.048
-Bernie, l can't do it.
-Hey, come on, 1 00% off.

01:40:55.132 --> 01:40:57.216
l can't do any better than that.
Take it or leave it.

01:40:57.301 --> 01:40:59.635
-Bernie, l can't.
-l stole it.

01:41:00.304 --> 01:41:03.639
-You did not.
-That's great, Dan. That's really great.

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:07.769
l tell you l'm a thief, and you call me a liar.
Nice guy.

01:41:07.853 --> 01:41:10.730
What's this? Menu?

01:41:10.814 --> 01:41:12.940
A pink menu? Pink?

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.986
Yo, Litko!

01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:19.197
Hey!

01:41:20.574 --> 01:41:22.784
-Thanks.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:41:22.868 --> 01:41:24.827
$4.95 for a burger?

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:27.497
l can get a burger down the street
for a buck and a half.

01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:28.998
No parking.

01:41:30.375 --> 01:41:32.126
Ain't gonna catch me around here.

01:41:32.211 --> 01:41:34.962
Hey. Awnings. Nice touch, Danny.

01:41:35.672 --> 01:41:37.465
The place ought to do okay.

01:41:37.549 --> 01:41:40.635
You'll meet a nice girl,
you'll settle down, you'll get married.

01:41:41.386 --> 01:41:43.096
Then she'll divorce you
and steal all your money.

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:46.974
Listen to this.
"You learn from your mistakes.

01:41:47.684 --> 01:41:51.020
"Man is the one animal
that has that capacity."

01:41:51.772 --> 01:41:54.816
-Right.
-"And in the end, what do you have?

01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:57.318
"You have your friends."

01:41:57.402 --> 01:42:01.155
l mean, it's not really therapy.
lt's like a workshop.

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:03.157
-Come with me.
-No.

01:42:03.242 --> 01:42:06.786
Don't you think that it's about time
you tried helping yourself?

01:42:07.579 --> 01:42:10.832
Look, this is not me helping myself.
This is you helping myself.

01:42:10.916 --> 01:42:13.459
Deborah, this workshop was made for you.

01:42:13.544 --> 01:42:17.672
l mean, just a simple weekend
dealing with rage and anger.

01:42:17.756 --> 01:42:22.510
With men and women sharing,
working out their hate.

01:42:23.428 --> 01:42:26.514
l'm sick of hating. Don't you understand?

01:42:26.598 --> 01:42:29.809
l mean, God, Joan,
l don't think l have any more hate left.

01:42:29.893 --> 01:42:32.311
Yes, you do. You just don't know it.

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:35.815
Just wait a second. Come back here.

01:42:36.859 --> 01:42:39.360
Let me tell you something about yourself.

01:42:39.444 --> 01:42:42.321
You and this psychobabble brochure
are just full of shit.

01:42:42.406 --> 01:42:43.906
You knew that l was in love with Danny,

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:46.450
and you did everything in your power
to break us up.

01:42:46.535 --> 01:42:49.704
So don't you dare tell me about friendship!

01:42:55.294 --> 01:42:57.587
l am such a bitch.

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:02.216
How do you put up with me?

01:43:04.303 --> 01:43:08.097
lf l didn't love you so much,
l'd throw you out the window.

01:43:14.938 --> 01:43:17.899
-Will you look at the nips on this one?
-Where?

01:43:17.983 --> 01:43:19.525
-T-shirt, blue shorts.
-Yeah.

01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:20.568
-Are you kidding me?
-Yeah.

01:43:20.652 --> 01:43:22.153
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-Yeah, yeah.

01:43:22.237 --> 01:43:24.030
-Are you pulling my leg?
-Yeah.

01:43:24.114 --> 01:43:26.407
That is a sensitive lady.

01:43:27.242 --> 01:43:30.077
-l think l can see her beaver.
-No shit? Really?

01:43:30.162 --> 01:43:31.287
-l'm telling you.
-Get out of here.

01:43:31.371 --> 01:43:33.748
-l'm telling you, look.
-Get the fuck out of here.

01:43:33.832 --> 01:43:37.168
-See? See?
-l can't make it out.

01:43:37.252 --> 01:43:41.422
-When she bends over. Top of her legs.
-l know where it is. l just can't see it.

01:43:41.506 --> 01:43:44.550
When the little flap goes up there.
You gotta look real close.

01:43:46.136 --> 01:43:50.431
That pisses me off.
That fucking pisses me off.

01:43:50.515 --> 01:43:53.059
l mean, where does she get off
with that noise?

01:43:53.143 --> 01:43:57.104
l mean, coming to the ballpark,
bending all over the ballpark.

01:43:57.189 --> 01:44:01.025
l mean, just flaunting her body.
l mean, what's a fellow supposed to think?

01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:04.111
l mean, a fellow comes out here to play ball.
Am l wrong?

01:44:04.196 --> 01:44:08.491
l mean, we're talking about space.
Recreational fucking space!

01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:13.162
-Feeling all right?
-Well, how do l look? Do l look all right?

01:44:13.247 --> 01:44:15.957
-You look fine.
-Well, then let's assume l feel all right!

01:44:16.041 --> 01:44:17.541
All right?

01:44:23.257 --> 01:44:25.383
Will you look at those...

01:44:25.467 --> 01:44:27.677
Shit. lt's what's-her-name.

01:44:33.934 --> 01:44:37.687
Just pretend you don't see her, that's all.
Don't look at her, man.

01:44:40.399 --> 01:44:41.732
Deborah?

01:44:44.361 --> 01:44:47.613
-You dickhead, now she sees you...
-Bernie, for Christ's sakes!

01:44:47.698 --> 01:44:49.407
The way l see it,

01:44:50.033 --> 01:44:53.369
either you can stay here
and continue to blame me,

01:44:57.082 --> 01:45:00.960
or you can go talk to him
and only have yourself to blame.

01:45:10.095 --> 01:45:11.178
Perfect.

01:45:21.565 --> 01:45:23.316
-Hey, guys.
-Hi.

01:45:23.859 --> 01:45:25.067
Hi.

01:45:26.903 --> 01:45:30.698
-Bernie, could you excuse us for a minute?
-Sure. Go ahead.

01:45:31.033 --> 01:45:32.992
-Come on, man.
-What?

01:45:33.452 --> 01:45:36.537
-Come on, don't be a jerk your whole life.
-What?

01:45:36.621 --> 01:45:39.165
She said don't be an asshole your whole life.

01:45:39.249 --> 01:45:44.003
Wait a minute. You're trying...
You want to talk. Go ahead. You guys talk.

01:45:44.087 --> 01:45:45.796
-You want a hot dog or something, Dan?
-No.

01:45:45.881 --> 01:45:49.175
Deb, you want
a nice hot ltalian sausage, maybe?

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.177
Okay. Joke.

01:45:57.267 --> 01:45:59.769
-How have you been?
-Great.

01:46:00.979 --> 01:46:03.272
You... You look great.

01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:06.150
Thanks. So do you.

01:46:14.951 --> 01:46:19.246
-l'm sorry things got so screwed up.
-l'm sorry, too.

01:46:24.419 --> 01:46:27.296
Well, that's really all l wanted to say.

01:46:32.928 --> 01:46:35.805
We really ripped it to shreds, didn't we?

01:46:36.973 --> 01:46:38.766
lt wasn't that bad.

01:46:39.351 --> 01:46:44.313
As bad as it got, l really think
that it was the best thing around.

01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:51.612
l think that l thought that it should be
the way it was with my parents,

01:46:52.572 --> 01:46:55.282
and l just wish l wouldn't have pushed.

01:46:55.367 --> 01:46:59.328
-You know, maybe if we had gone slower...
-No, it was me. l...

01:47:01.415 --> 01:47:04.750
l think l thought
it was gonna be different than...

01:47:04.835 --> 01:47:07.545
Than what it was really like. Me, too.

01:47:09.005 --> 01:47:11.465
Maybe we were just too naive.

01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:17.179
Yeah, maybe. Maybe we knew too much.

01:47:18.515 --> 01:47:19.974
That, too.

01:47:21.017 --> 01:47:26.564
But how can you be against freedom?
Freedom is good.

01:47:30.152 --> 01:47:32.903
l mean, you gotta believe in something.

01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:40.578
l just want you to know
that when we were together,

01:47:41.204 --> 01:47:43.205
l was really happy.

01:47:52.799 --> 01:47:54.216
l gotta go.

01:47:59.389 --> 01:48:01.724
Could we have dinner sometime?

01:48:03.018 --> 01:48:04.727
Yeah, we could.

01:48:05.937 --> 01:48:10.983
Actually, my roommate is going
out of town for the weekend,

01:48:11.067 --> 01:48:14.904
and l don't have any special plans
for tonight, even.

01:48:15.489 --> 01:48:18.991
lf you happen to be in the neighborhood,
we could do Chinese or something.

01:48:19.075 --> 01:48:21.535
l know a great new restaurant.
l think you'd love it.

01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:23.162
-A new place?
-Yeah.

01:48:23.246 --> 01:48:24.997
Let's just go to some old joint.

01:48:25.081 --> 01:48:28.876
lt's not. lt's not new.
lt's an old joint that's been...

01:48:40.722 --> 01:48:44.016
-So...
-So...

01:48:44.976 --> 01:48:47.561
Let's just sit with this a while.

01:48:48.772 --> 01:48:51.398
l'm gonna ride off into the sunset.

01:48:52.150 --> 01:48:55.486
-You mind if l watch?
-l was hoping you would.

01:48:59.783 --> 01:49:04.119
l can't believe we're doing this.
Why are we doing this?

01:49:12.754 --> 01:49:15.339
Boy, she had a bug up her ass, huh?

01:49:20.178 --> 01:49:21.387
What?

01:49:22.055 --> 01:49:26.850
What, l'm gonna stick around all day
with that face, that attitude, huh?

01:49:26.935 --> 01:49:29.562
You're not gonna be any good to the team.
Why don't you just get lost?

01:49:29.646 --> 01:49:31.480
Come on, go home.

01:49:32.899 --> 01:49:34.316
Go on.

01:49:43.243 --> 01:49:45.995
Hi. lsn't this a coincidence, huh?

01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:49.039
You know, l was thinking...

01:49:50.834 --> 01:49:51.959
What?
