50:18.809 --> 50:22.020
<i>It was one of those absurd fantasies,
just like one has when one is a girl...</i>

<i>being wooed and married
by the ideal of one's dreams.</i>

50:30.278 --> 50:33.740
<i>I stared out of that
railway carriage window into the dark...</i>

50:33.824 --> 50:38.078
<i>and watched the dim trees
and the telegraph posts slipping by...</i>

50:38.161 --> 50:40.330
<i>and through them, I saw Alec and me.</i>

50:42.290 --> 50:44.626
<i>Alec and me</i> -

50:44.710 --> 50:47.963
<i>perhaps a little younger than we are now,
but just as much in love...</i>

<i>and with nothing in the way.</i>

50:55.303 --> 50:58.473
<i>I saw us in Paris, in a box at the opera.</i>

50:58.557 --> 51:00.976
<i>The orchestra was tuning up.</i>

51:05.647 --> 51:09.234
<i>Then We were in Venice, drifting along
the Grand Canal in a gondola...</i>

51:09.317 --> 51:13.113
<i>with the sound of mandolins
coming to us over the water.</i>

51:13.196 --> 51:15.699
<i>I saw us traveling far away together...</i>

51:15.782 --> 51:18.910
<i>all the places I've always longed to go.</i>

51:20.662 --> 51:24.624
<i>I saw us leaning on the rail of a ship,
looking at the sea and the stars...</i>

51:26.668 --> 51:28.712
<i>standing on a tropical beach
in the moonlight...</i>

51:28.795 --> 51:31.548
<i>with the palm trees sighing above us.</i>

51:32.132 --> 51:35.594
<i>Then the palm trees changed into those
pollarded willows by the canal...</i>

51:35.677 --> 51:38.430
<i>just before the level crossing...</i>

51:38.513 --> 51:41.516
<i>and all the silly dreams disappeared...</i>

51:41.600 --> 51:45.479
<i>and I got out at Ketchworth
and gave up my ticket...</i>

51:45.562 --> 51:47.856

<i>It started then -

<i>the guiltiness, the fear.</i>

52:11.213 --> 52:15.342
- Good evening, Mrs. Jesson.
- Hello, dear.

52:15.425 --> 52:17.636
- Had a good day?
- Yes, lovely.

52:18.553 --> 52:21.097
- What'd you do?
- Well, I shopped...

52:21.181 --> 52:23.099
and had lunch
and went to the pictures.

52:23.183 --> 52:25.477
- All by yourself?
- Yes.

52:25.560 --> 52:27.729
Uh, no, not exactly.

52:27.813 --> 52:30.190
What do you mean, “not exactly”?

52:30.273 --> 52:34.069
Well, I went to the pictures by myself,
but I had lunch with Mary Norton.

52:34.152 --> 52:37.072
She couldn't come to the pictures
'cause she had to go and see her in-laws.

52:37.155 --> 52:39.324
They live just outside Milford, you know.

52:39.407 --> 52:42.118
So I walked with her to the bus
and then came home on my own.

52:42.202 --> 52:44.996
Haven't seen Mary Norton for ages.
How is she looking?

52:45.080 --> 52:47.332
Very well, really. A little fatter, I thought.

Hurry up with all this beautifying.
I want my dinner.

- Yes, I'll hold on.

No, I haven't seen you for ages.

Listen, my dear...

- <i>As bad as all that?</i>
- My life depends on it.

53:51.479 --> 53:54.733
Well, today, I went into Milford, as usual,
to do my shopping...

53:54.816 --> 53:58.987

54:05.368 --> 54:08.204
<i>but they rang up their branch
in Broadham and said there was one there...</i>

54:08.288 --> 54:10.415
<i>so I hopped on the 1:30 train
and went to get it.</i>

54:10.498 --> 54:15.587
- Go on.
- Well, this is where the black lie comes in.

54:15.670 --> 54:18.924
Fred asked me if I'd had a good day,
and I said yes...

54:19.007 --> 54:22.052
and that you and I had lunch together
and that you had gone to see your in-laws...

54:22.135 --> 54:24.054
and I had gone to the pictures.

54:24.137 --> 54:28.600
- So if you run into him, don't let me down, will you?
- <i>Darling, of course not.</i>

54:28.683 --> 54:32.270
- I'll do as much for you, I promise.
- <i>Well, let's really lunch one day.</i>

- Yes, that'd be lovely.
- <i>What about next Thursday?</i>

54:35.357 --> 54:39.486
No, I can't on Thursday.
That's my Milford day. What about Friday?

54:39.569 --> 54:43.615
- <i>Fine, better make it here.</i>
- All right, perfect.

<i>You know what my cook's like.
It'll have to be early.</i>

55:08.556 --> 55:10.976
<i>I went through it in a sort of trance.</i>

55:13.269 --> 55:17.148
<i>How odd of you not to have noticed that
you were living with a stranger in the house.</i>

55:19.776 --> 55:22.070
<i>Thursday came at last.</i>

55:22.153 --> 55:25.740
<i>I had arranged to meet Alec
outside the hospital at 12:30.</i>

55:32.497 --> 55:34.749
- Hello.
- Hello.

55:34.833 --> 55:38.753
I thought you wouldn't come. I've been
thinking all the week that you wouldn't come.

55:39.337 --> 55:42.757
I didn't mean to really, but here I am.

55:48.096 --> 55:51.558
<i>Do you know, I hadn't been inside the Royal
since Violet's wedding reception.</i>

55:51.641 --> 55:53.560
<i>It all seemed very grand.</i>

55:53.643 --> 55:55.729
<i>He actually ordered a bottle of champagne...</i>

55:55.812 --> 55:58.732
<i>and when I protested, he said
that we were only middle-aged once.</i>

55:58.815 --> 56:01.901
<i>We were very gay during lunch
and talked about quite ordinary things.</i>

56:01.985 --> 56:03.695
<i>Oh, Fred, he really was charming.</i>

56:03.778 --> 56:06.573
<i>I know you would have liked him
if only things had been different.</i>

56:07.073 --> 56:09.576
<i>As we were going out,
he said that he had a surprise for me...</i>

56:09.659 --> 56:13.079
<i>and that if I would wait in the lounge
for five minutes, he'd show me what it was.</i>

56:13.163 --> 56:15.206
<i>He went out and down the steps at a run...</i>

56:15.290 --> 56:18.793
<i>more like an excited schoolboy
than a respectable doctor.</i>

56:19.461 --> 56:23.798
<i>Suddenly out of the dining room came Mary Norton
and that rich over-made-up cousin of hers.</i>

56:24.424 --> 56:26.384
<i>They must have been
in the dining room all the time...</i>

56:26.468 --> 56:28.386
<i>and seen Alec and me
and the champagne and everything.</i>

56:29.804 --> 56:33.308
Laura! So it was you after all.
Hermione said it was.

56:33.391 --> 56:35.435
- How are you?
- You know how shortsighted I am.

56:35.518 --> 56:37.437
I peered and peered and still couldn't be sure.

56:37.520 --> 56:40.732
I never saw you at all. How awful of me.
I expect it was the champagne.

56:40.815 --> 56:42.817
I'm not used to champagne for lunch.

56:42.901 --> 56:45.361
Or for dinner either, for that matter,
but Alec insisted.

56:45.445 --> 56:47.614
Alec? Alec who, dear?

56:47.697 --> 56:51.326
Alec Harvey, of course. Surely you remember
the Harveys. I've known them for years.

56:51.409 --> 56:53.953
- No, I don't think I ever-
- He'll be back in a minute.

56:54.037 --> 56:56.122
You'll probably recognize him
when you peer very closely.

56:56.206 --> 56:58.750
He looks very charming and very attentive.

56:58.833 --> 57:02.337
He's a dear. One of the nicest people
in the world and a wonderful doctor.

57:05.256 --> 57:09.219
- Oh, Alec, you remember Mrs. Norton, don't you?
- I'm afraid I don't.

57:09.302 --> 57:13.640
It's no use, Laura. We've never seen each other
before in our lives. I'm quite sure we haven't.

57:13.723 --> 57:16.518
How absurd. I made certain he and Madeleine
were there when you dined with us...

- How do you do? Horrid weather, isn't it?
- Yes.

Of course, one can't really expect spring

just outside a village and got out.</i>

58:22.000 --> 58:24.335
<i>There was a little bridge and a stream...</i>

<i>We leaned on the parapet of the bridge
and looked down into the water.</i>

58:48.359 --> 58:51.154
That it isn't worth it.

That the furtiveness and lying outweigh
the happiness we might have together.

It is true for you, isn't it?
