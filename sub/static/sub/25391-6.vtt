Hey, kids, if this wasn't a commercial,

17:17.010 --> 17:20.458
this was real life, and I
came up to you in a teen club,

17:20.491 --> 17:22.079
would you dance with me?

17:23.864 --> 17:26.297

18:45.806 --> 18:47.969
<i>That was the commercial
that led to the shutdown</i>

18:47.994 --> 18:50.611
<i>of Boom teen nightclub
earlier today,</i>

18:50.777 --> 18:53.112
where a swarm of
middle-age men were arrested

18:53.146 --> 18:55.982
for posing as teens
attempting to gain entry.

18:56.314 --> 18:57.949

18:57.982 --> 19:00.349
<i>the men said, "Mr. Groove sent us."</i>

19:00.885 --> 19:03.188
<i>Between you and me, it
seems like that commercial</i>

19:03.221 --> 19:06.291
<i>was telling old me how to
sneak into a teen club.</i>

19:06.855 --> 19:08.597
I think we should have
a policy where we're not in

19:08.597 --> 19:09.621
the commercials anymore.

19:09.621 --> 19:10.996
I think that would be best.

19:10.996 --> 19:12.190
Yeah, it's just hard to remain objective

19:12.224 --> 19:13.352

19:13.377 --> 19:14.683
Yeah, no, I know.

19:14.708 --> 19:16.673
Like, you know, I thought Mr.
Groove was a terrible idea.

19:16.784 --> 19:18.018
But then I got in front of camera,

19:18.052 --> 19:19.557
and I became a friggin' pedo.

19:19.557 --> 19:22.262
- Well, you weren't a pedo.
- Mr. Groove's a pedo.

19:22.287 --> 19:25.310
Yeah, thanks, bud, and
actually, he wasn't even.

19:25.310 --> 19:27.749
He actually became young Mr. Groove.

19:27.749 --> 19:30.020
He wasn't, like, old guy
in a young guy's body.

19:30.045 --> 19:31.543
He became a kid.

19:32.186 --> 19:34.989
Yeah, I think you and I can
both agree that was not clear.

19:35.022 --> 19:37.091
- I concede that.
- Oh, come on.

19:37.550 --> 19:39.441
I got to get me into Boom.

19:39.727 --> 19:42.829
Oh, pretty please, make me a teen.

19:42.859 --> 19:44.565
So we won't be in the commercials anymore.

19:44.599 --> 19:46.033
Yeah, no, that's probably the new rule.

19:46.067 --> 19:47.603
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
