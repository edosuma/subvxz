00:11.530 --> 00:13.609
Why would you do that?

00:13.610 --> 00:15.954
Do what?

00:15.955 --> 00:17.239
Jump.

00:54.990 --> 00:56.739
If I wanna be happy,

00:56.740 --> 00:58.759
I have to get away from you.

01:00.457 --> 01:01.949
Hey, buddy.

01:01.950 --> 01:03.875
Dude.

01:17.890 --> 01:19.182
I said shut up.

01:19.183 --> 01:21.419
- Where is she, asshole?
- Fuck you...

01:21.420 --> 01:22.430
Where is she?

01:35.650 --> 01:38.869
You're okay, you're okay. Are you okay?

01:50.965 --> 01:53.499
Two... three!

01:54.510 --> 01:55.669
Ray!

02:35.280 --> 02:38.259
Are your parents still alive?

02:38.260 --> 02:40.529
My father is.

02:40.530 --> 02:43.270
How's your relationship with him?

02:45.720 --> 02:47.349
All right.

02:47.350 --> 02:48.855
Just all right?

02:48.856 --> 02:51.169
It's a long story.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.570
You wanna tell me?

03:01.140 --> 03:02.870
He's a piece of shit.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.110
You run, they come after Bunch.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.699
Run?

03:39.700 --> 03:41.826
I was just goin' out for donuts.

03:43.540 --> 03:45.219
Donuts...

03:45.220 --> 03:46.414
pack of cigarettes.

03:46.415 --> 03:49.239
My hand to God, Raymond.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.630
All right.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.935
Let's go.

04:11.750 --> 04:14.858
Gimme a minute, will ya?

04:14.859 --> 04:17.959
I'll meet you in the car.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.589
Four-leaf clover, Raymond.

05:29.260 --> 05:31.739
So you brought him there yourself?

05:31.740 --> 05:34.560
Yeah. I drove him.

05:34.570 --> 05:36.772
- What was that like for you?
- What?

05:36.773 --> 05:38.139
What'd it feel like to...

05:38.140 --> 05:40.760
to take your father and turn
him in to the authorities?

05:42.750 --> 05:45.299
I dunno.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.159
Wasn't the first time.

06:01.780 --> 06:05.919
Which one of you called me "daddy baby"?

06:05.920 --> 06:07.509
What?

06:07.510 --> 06:09.779
It was Bunch.

06:09.780 --> 06:11.601
I remember.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.579
I remember everything.

06:15.580 --> 06:17.179
Okay.

06:17.180 --> 06:19.680
I'm goin'.

06:21.140 --> 06:23.480
Send my love all around.

06:33.370 --> 06:37.126
_

06:47.030 --> 06:49.139
You brought him there yourself, right?

06:49.140 --> 06:50.659
You didn't have to force him.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.889
Yeah, I did.

06:51.890 --> 06:53.159
But in the end,

06:53.160 --> 06:56.640
you said he walked in on his own, right?

07:02.310 --> 07:04.080
Yeah.

07:06.230 --> 07:07.679
Let me ask you something,

07:07.680 --> 07:09.659
just... just hypothetically speaking.

07:09.660 --> 07:11.899
What would happen if you,

07:11.900 --> 07:16.160
you know, if you just
put all this anger aside

07:16.170 --> 07:18.139
and just forgave your father?

07:24.080 --> 07:28.100
_

07:32.050 --> 07:35.160
I got something.

07:38.771 --> 07:41.360
I got it.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.319
Oh, it's heavy. Come on.

07:48.780 --> 07:51.739
What the hell?

09:08.611 --> 09:10.361
I didn't do anything!

09:15.940 --> 09:18.069
Jesus Christ.

09:21.166 --> 09:23.179
Hey, are you okay?

09:23.180 --> 09:24.750
All right.

09:24.752 --> 09:26.837
He's all right.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.719
You don't know what
the fuck you're doing!

09:37.720 --> 09:40.060
Shut up.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.369
You need to stay away
from Britney Muller.

09:46.370 --> 09:47.879
Fuck you!

09:47.880 --> 09:49.901
- Fuck me?
- Yeah, fuck you!

09:54.400 --> 09:56.239
You go near her again,

09:56.240 --> 09:57.819
I'll break your fucking arms.

09:57.820 --> 09:59.540
Are we clear?

10:26.300 --> 10:28.180
I'm sorry.

10:29.640 --> 10:32.940
I don't think I handled
that very well, uh...

10:34.660 --> 10:38.629
I think you might be mixed
up about Ms. Muller.

10:38.630 --> 10:41.540
You should talk to someone
about that, you know?

10:43.580 --> 10:45.960
Get some help.

11:02.450 --> 11:04.279
Can you reach the party napkins,

11:04.280 --> 11:06.119
the red ones?

11:06.120 --> 11:07.855
Sure.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.619
The four arch angels

11:13.620 --> 11:15.738
send me people like you every day.

11:18.340 --> 11:21.139
Sure.

12:12.336 --> 12:15.000
Jesus... fuck.

12:28.220 --> 12:29.499
Doctor's office.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.619
Yeah, Te-Terry... Terry Donovan.

12:32.620 --> 12:35.401
I gotta talk to Dr. Basset.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.820
Wow.

12:48.800 --> 12:52.269
Adam's bringing that kid by today.

12:52.270 --> 12:54.139
Why do you do that?

12:54.140 --> 12:55.169
What?

12:55.170 --> 12:57.799
He's like one of the biggest
stars on the planet.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.459
- Who?
- Jonathan Walker Hanson.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.859
- So?
- So you know who he is

13:02.860 --> 13:04.980
and you act like you don't,
and it's fucking annoying.

13:13.580 --> 13:16.120
You okay?

13:22.480 --> 13:24.949
I don't think I wanna be married.

13:24.950 --> 13:28.120
Think I made a huge mistake.

13:29.620 --> 13:33.059
I mean, I love Smitty,
I do, but I don't...

13:33.060 --> 13:35.299
I don't know what I wanna do,
I don't know who I wanna be,

13:35.300 --> 13:36.790
and... and he doesn't either.

13:42.900 --> 13:45.340
You meet someone else?

13:48.240 --> 13:50.239
It's all right, Bridge, it happens.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.640
Yeah, it happened with you a lot.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.519
No, I'm sorry. I-I'm...

13:59.520 --> 14:02.499
Yes. Yeah, I...

14:02.500 --> 14:03.899
There's someone else.

14:03.900 --> 14:06.879
Nothing's happened,
but I don't wanna lie,

14:06.880 --> 14:09.200
and I don't wanna cheat.

14:11.430 --> 14:13.400
So don't.

14:17.980 --> 14:21.139
Try loosening your grip a little bit.

14:51.720 --> 14:56.699
Attention in the yard,
attention in the yard...

14:56.700 --> 14:59.200
Painful.

14:59.210 --> 15:02.820
Guess all beauty has
pain attached to it.

15:06.580 --> 15:09.059
What do you think?

15:09.060 --> 15:10.159
Yeah.

15:10.160 --> 15:13.099
It's good. I like it.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.059
So you're gonna see him in prison?

15:15.060 --> 15:16.299
- Yeah.
- Today?

15:16.300 --> 15:18.659
I just said that.

15:18.660 --> 15:21.608
- You wanna talk about it?
- Not really.

15:22.780 --> 15:26.319
Does seeing him make
you feel uncomfortable?

15:26.320 --> 15:29.479
I dunno.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.076
- You don't know.
- Okay.

15:31.077 --> 15:35.299
Yeah, yes, seeing my father
makes me uncomfortable.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.739
So what can you do about that?

15:36.740 --> 15:38.160
- I don't know.
- How can you make yourself

15:38.170 --> 15:40.119
- less uncomfortable?
- You tell me.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.569
That's why I'm here.

15:41.570 --> 15:42.879
So why are you going to see him?

15:42.880 --> 15:44.160
Because you told me to.

15:44.170 --> 15:46.719
That's... you... I... That's
what I thought you said,

15:46.720 --> 15:49.779
that if I-I...

15:49.780 --> 15:51.299
work something out with Mick

15:51.300 --> 15:53.079
that somehow that'll
make my life better.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.719
Well, it's worth getting you to try.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.685
A lot of people have
benefitted from that.

15:57.686 --> 16:00.449
- What?
- They try...

16:00.450 --> 16:02.799
getting in touch with them.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.419
The question is, can you do it?

16:05.420 --> 16:08.389
Can you take a... a baby
step in that direction?

16:08.390 --> 16:13.049
Can you take a step
that's... that's so tiny

16:13.050 --> 16:15.912
that there's no... there's no risk?

16:15.913 --> 16:19.429
What can you change about you

16:19.430 --> 16:22.559
that'll make it easier
for you to be with him?

16:25.520 --> 16:27.379
I can breathe.

16:27.380 --> 16:30.718
Do the breathing thing you said.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.259
Been a while, huh?

16:48.260 --> 16:50.719
Yeah.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.620
Everyone come by already.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.969
Daryll came a couple times.
Even Terry came.

16:57.970 --> 17:00.420
That was nice of him, you know?

17:03.540 --> 17:05.638
When'd you get that?

17:05.640 --> 17:06.749
Oh.

17:06.750 --> 17:09.279
- Today.
- Yeah?

17:09.280 --> 17:11.199
Yeah.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.799
Yeah, I figured why not?

17:12.800 --> 17:14.049
Sure.

17:14.050 --> 17:15.179
Four leaf.

17:15.180 --> 17:17.560
Mm-hmm.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.839
So when are they, uh,

17:19.839 --> 17:21.395
when are they transferring ya upstate?

17:21.396 --> 17:23.438
Today.

17:24.599 --> 17:27.999
- What?
- Yeah, you didn't know that?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.740
Yeah, today.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.860
- Mick.
- Yeah?

17:33.865 --> 17:37.786
Listen, I... I wanna say, uh...

17:39.780 --> 17:41.739
I wanna say thanks.

17:41.740 --> 17:45.460
- For what?
- You know, for all of it. For...

17:45.470 --> 17:48.039
for taking responsibility, you know.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.879
- For...
- Uh-huh.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.634
Doin' the right thing. For Bunch.

17:54.460 --> 17:57.970
I just wanted you to know I
was... I was grateful for that.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.760
You're welcome.

18:04.780 --> 18:07.360
Somethin' else.

18:12.380 --> 18:16.032
A lotta shit's gone down
between us, you know.

18:16.033 --> 18:19.339
I mean, you... you weren't exactly a...

18:19.340 --> 18:21.622
you weren't exactly a great father.

18:22.820 --> 18:26.760
Uh, all I'm saying is...

18:26.770 --> 18:29.921
I just... I want you to know that...

18:31.630 --> 18:34.019
I...

18:34.020 --> 18:35.510
I forgive you.

18:36.820 --> 18:38.679
You forgive me?

18:38.680 --> 18:40.509
Yeah. I forgive you.

18:40.510 --> 18:42.259
You forgive me.

18:42.260 --> 18:44.852
Raymond, 20 years...

18:44.853 --> 18:47.559
sitting in Walpole for 20 fucking years,

18:47.560 --> 18:50.859
and all that time I coulda
been with my fuckin' family.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.460
I shoulda been.

18:52.470 --> 18:54.099
But you took it from me, Raymond.

18:54.100 --> 18:57.009
You took it from me. You stole it.

18:57.010 --> 18:59.599
And now... I'm gonna die in prison.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.079
For what you set me up for.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.639
And you're... you wanna forgive me.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.679
You should get down
on your fuckin' knees

19:06.680 --> 19:09.127
and beg me to forgive you, Raymond.

19:12.100 --> 19:14.290
Fuck you.

19:21.590 --> 19:23.459
So what'd the doctor say?

19:23.460 --> 19:25.899
He... well, he said I'm at stage four

19:25.900 --> 19:27.728
and he gave me new medication.

19:27.729 --> 19:30.439
Dopamine agonist. Mirapex.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.399
Mirapex?

19:32.400 --> 19:34.599
- That got side effects?
- Yeah.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.819
Legs swelling. Hallucinations.

19:36.820 --> 19:39.060
Sex stuff, gambling stuff,

19:39.070 --> 19:42.029
overeatin' and sleep attacks.

19:42.030 --> 19:43.939
The fuck is a sleep attack?

19:43.940 --> 19:46.203
You fall asleep all of a sudden.
I don't fuckin' know.

19:46.204 --> 19:48.639
I told the doctor that
I started seein' shit,

19:48.640 --> 19:50.085
and he gives me new medicine.

19:50.086 --> 19:53.419
What... what about the machine?

19:53.420 --> 19:55.631
He said I can't turn it on anymore.

19:55.632 --> 19:59.479
That's it, I'm gonna be shakin'
like this till the day I die.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.180
Jesus, Ter.

20:03.390 --> 20:05.409
Well...

20:05.410 --> 20:07.959
I guess you gotta take it
if you gotta take it, right?

20:07.960 --> 20:09.659
Brendan!

20:09.660 --> 20:11.022
I gotta go.

20:17.980 --> 20:20.699
Hey.

20:20.700 --> 20:23.368
Have you ever tried milk thistle tea?

20:25.560 --> 20:27.160
Are y... are you talkin' to me?

20:32.060 --> 20:34.099
Tremors are associated with the liver

20:34.100 --> 20:36.560
because that's what controls
the ligaments and tendons,

20:36.570 --> 20:39.423
and milk thistle is amazing
for liver problems.

20:39.424 --> 20:43.039
And there are no side effects.
Just the good stuff gets done.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.999
All of this stuff is just
toxic for the liver,

20:45.000 --> 20:46.009
but they won't tell you that here.

20:46.010 --> 20:48.399
They'll just keep pushing it
on you for their bottom line.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.239
That's big pharma, right?

20:50.240 --> 20:52.199
I'm Liberty.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.579
Uh, I'm Terry.

20:53.580 --> 20:56.249
I didn't mean to intrude.
I heard you talking.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.209
You have a nice energy.

20:58.210 --> 21:00.379
Sagittarius, right?

21:00.380 --> 21:01.939
Your zodiac sign.

21:01.940 --> 21:06.399
- When you were born...
- Yeah, I know what Sagittarius means.

21:06.400 --> 21:10.379
I spent a lotta time in California.

21:10.380 --> 21:13.099
We've worked with quite a few
people with your condition.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.879
They come to us when the Western meds

21:14.880 --> 21:16.963
aren't doing it for them anymore.

21:16.964 --> 21:19.859
Are you doing anything later?

21:19.860 --> 21:21.760
We have a tea ritual.

21:21.770 --> 21:25.509
The first full moon of every month.

21:25.510 --> 21:27.659
That's my direct line.

21:27.660 --> 21:29.019
It's ready!

21:29.020 --> 21:31.599
Oh, is that me?

21:31.600 --> 21:33.460
So what are you doing here

21:33.470 --> 21:36.759
if this is all... big pharma?

21:36.760 --> 21:39.200
Birth control.

21:49.930 --> 21:51.372
Yeah.

21:51.373 --> 21:53.124
Did you get anywhere
with Kevin Sullivan?

21:53.125 --> 21:55.359
I'm workin' on it now.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.859
I need to close the deal tonight.

21:56.860 --> 22:00.269
I can't be embarrassed by some
double-dealing billionaire, Ray.

22:00.270 --> 22:02.160
I need to announce the hospital.

22:02.170 --> 22:03.939
All the sick little children of New York

22:03.940 --> 22:04.999
are depending on it.

22:22.630 --> 22:24.939
What do you got on Kevin Sullivan?

22:24.940 --> 22:27.139
I got to his guy, so
he's gonna help us out.

22:27.140 --> 22:29.080
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:30.360 --> 22:33.179
How'd it go with the stalker?

22:33.180 --> 22:35.099
I talked to him.

22:35.100 --> 22:36.899
Talked to him?

22:36.900 --> 22:38.780
Yeah.

22:47.070 --> 22:48.439
That's his friend.

22:48.440 --> 22:49.930
Twice a week golf.

22:49.931 --> 22:52.909
Some time upstairs together.

22:52.910 --> 22:54.920
And then right home
to the wife and kids.

23:03.640 --> 23:06.020
- What's that?
- You'll see.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.920
Mmm...

24:07.635 --> 24:10.989
The fuck... What the fuck?
Who the fuck are you?

24:10.990 --> 24:12.764
- I'm keeping the clothes.
- Fuck!

24:12.765 --> 24:14.699
Who the fuck are you?

24:34.494 --> 24:35.954
You need to honor the deal.

24:37.260 --> 24:39.659
You understand?

24:39.660 --> 24:41.199
I know you.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.019
By tomorrow.

24:44.020 --> 24:46.840
I fuckin' know you.

24:56.580 --> 24:58.079
Hello, Big Al.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.854
We missed you.

25:03.640 --> 25:07.599
That is Officer Albert Clancy.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.669
Bullet hole?

25:10.670 --> 25:11.959
Nine millimeter.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.658
Exit wound?

25:19.930 --> 25:21.579
Doesn't look like it.

25:21.580 --> 25:23.639
Get the slug to ballistics.

25:23.640 --> 25:26.460
I wanna know what kind
of gun I'm looking for.

25:26.470 --> 25:28.200
Sure.

25:40.160 --> 25:41.349
Yeah.

25:41.350 --> 25:44.639
I'm not paying you five
figures to deliver messages.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.979
You were supposed to take out the bat.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.609
He got the message, Stu.

25:48.610 --> 25:49.979
The bat, Ray!

25:49.980 --> 25:52.697
The ba...

26:03.124 --> 26:05.960
Sir.

26:19.770 --> 26:22.699
You all know who Alexander Hamilton was.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.869
He's finishing with the kids.

26:24.870 --> 26:26.699
Well, he wasn't ever president,

26:26.700 --> 26:28.219
but after he was shot,

26:28.220 --> 26:31.719
he died under this very chandelier.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.779
So thank you so much
for coming to visit.

26:34.780 --> 26:36.199
Thank you.

26:36.200 --> 26:38.919
All right, kids, let's circle up now.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.411
Nobody tells you half this job

26:40.412 --> 26:42.459
is being a fucking Macy's Santa Claus.

26:42.460 --> 26:43.639
One at a time...

26:43.640 --> 26:45.480
Kevin Sullivan?

26:47.360 --> 26:49.290
I worked on this deal for years.

26:49.295 --> 26:51.756
It's a legacy situation.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.879
He can't change the fucking terms

26:54.880 --> 26:56.880
after I've announced it to the press.

26:56.886 --> 26:59.388
I think he understands that now.

26:59.389 --> 27:02.679
Well, let's see.

27:02.680 --> 27:05.350
He thinks he can steal 500 million

27:05.353 --> 27:08.314
from the citizens of New Yo...

27:09.700 --> 27:10.979
Jesus.

27:10.980 --> 27:14.520
Ray, is that a child?

27:14.529 --> 27:16.364
A little person.

27:19.940 --> 27:23.839
Now that is goddamn tradecraft.

27:41.306 --> 27:43.909
Yeah?

27:43.910 --> 27:45.809
That head that came up,

27:45.810 --> 27:47.279
one of our three missing cops.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.062
- Which one?
- Albert Clancy.

27:49.063 --> 27:50.522
I'm waiting on ballistics,

27:50.523 --> 27:52.732
but I want to get a dredge
going where he was found.

27:52.733 --> 27:55.359
Do you think whoever's killing
cops and chopping off heads

27:55.360 --> 27:57.059
is stupid enough to dump
them all in one place?

27:57.060 --> 27:59.240
I don't know, but I want to find out.

28:00.300 --> 28:03.089
Three divers, that's it,
and keep it to yourself.

28:03.090 --> 28:04.819
I don't want to have
to explain a big circus

28:04.820 --> 28:05.955
if you come up empty.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.369
Start a board with everything we've got,

28:12.370 --> 28:14.039
and get me all Clancy's phone records

28:14.040 --> 28:16.670
from the last month he was alive.

28:52.880 --> 28:53.919
Let me know.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.879
Mr. Donovan.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.159
Yeah?

29:10.160 --> 29:13.039
Detective Perry, Homicide.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.104
What can I do for you?

29:14.105 --> 29:15.619
Wanted to talk to you about officers

29:15.620 --> 29:18.152
Danny Bianchi, Mike
Radulovic, and Al Clancy.

29:18.153 --> 29:20.059
You know them?

29:20.060 --> 29:21.669
Friends of a friend.

29:21.670 --> 29:23.099
- Sean McGrath?
- Right.

29:23.100 --> 29:26.076
How would you describe
their relationship?

29:26.077 --> 29:28.049
I dunno.

29:28.050 --> 29:30.494
Guys who drink together
after work, watch sports.

29:30.495 --> 29:31.579
That kinda thing.

29:31.580 --> 29:32.619
The night of November 7th

29:32.620 --> 29:34.624
was the night McGrath
killed himself, correct?

29:34.625 --> 29:36.199
I don't remember the exact date.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.479
It was.

29:37.480 --> 29:40.669
It was also the same night
the other three disappeared.

29:40.670 --> 29:41.709
Yeah, I heard.

29:41.710 --> 29:44.019
That same night, McGrath called you.

29:44.020 --> 29:45.160
Do you remember that call?

29:47.480 --> 29:51.079
Uh... yeah, he did.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.579
Did he mention the other men?

29:53.580 --> 29:55.599
No.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.079
He was talking about his
kid, taking a vacation.

29:59.080 --> 30:00.749
I didn't get what he meant till, uh...

30:00.750 --> 30:02.029
till I heard the news.

30:02.030 --> 30:05.059
Okay.

30:05.060 --> 30:07.549
I appreciate your time.

30:31.620 --> 30:33.259
Hey, uh, Ray,

30:33.260 --> 30:36.840
some, uh, cop came in
here asking about you.

30:36.850 --> 30:37.940
Yeah.

30:37.950 --> 30:40.269
What was that about?

30:40.270 --> 30:41.735
Nothing.

30:41.736 --> 30:44.109
She was a cop.

30:44.110 --> 30:46.719
Don't worry about it.

30:46.720 --> 30:51.240
Um, Adam Rain is here with,
uh, Jonathan Walker Hanson.

30:55.140 --> 30:56.939
Detective snooping around about Mac.

30:56.940 --> 31:00.080
- Yeah, I know.
- See if anything's changed.

31:05.580 --> 31:08.299
Ray, good to see you.
Thanks for making the time.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.199
- Sure.
- Jonathan, this is Ray Donovan,

31:10.200 --> 31:11.766
- Bridget's father.
- How are you?

31:11.770 --> 31:14.140
Have a seat.

31:23.986 --> 31:26.530
Do you have to tell my
mother why I'm here?

31:26.531 --> 31:28.559
Why are you here?

31:28.560 --> 31:30.999
I've got 73 million followers, right?

31:31.000 --> 31:34.009
And 20,000 to 25,000
usually want to come

31:34.010 --> 31:35.289
to one of my shows, right?

31:35.290 --> 31:36.359
Okay.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.041
And so I get a lot of requests, right?

31:38.042 --> 31:40.589
For stuff that I could just
never really do, you know?

31:40.590 --> 31:42.939
I mean, a lot of girls want
me to be their prom dates,

31:42.940 --> 31:45.159
and a lot of kids are
sick in the hospital,

31:45.160 --> 31:47.189
and a lot of moms want me
to visit their daughter

31:47.190 --> 31:49.039
at some birthday party
for, like, five minutes.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.839
I mean, a lot of them even
offer me money, you know?

31:50.840 --> 31:54.019
Like, a couple hundred thou,
go to a party for a minute.

31:54.020 --> 31:55.419
What'd you do?

31:55.420 --> 31:57.919
Well, sometimes when
a mom offers me to go

31:57.920 --> 31:59.199
to one of these birthday parties,

31:59.200 --> 32:02.819
they offer me more than just money.

32:02.820 --> 32:04.779
What do they offer you?

32:04.780 --> 32:06.999
Blowjob.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.281
They wanna fuck.

32:12.220 --> 32:14.589
How many times has this happened?

32:14.590 --> 32:16.989
Maybe 200.

32:16.990 --> 32:20.459
Maybe, and so this one woman,

32:20.460 --> 32:22.939
- I'll just call her Joan, right?
- Hmm.

32:22.940 --> 32:25.422
So I told her I'd go to her
daughter's prom party,

32:25.423 --> 32:27.399
and so she came to my hotel room.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.439
Okay.

32:28.440 --> 32:31.399
And she asked me if she
could take my picture.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.598
- And you let her?
- Pfft, yeah.

32:33.599 --> 32:37.119
But, uh, now she's
saying she wants money.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.149
But, I mean, I don't think
I should do that, right?

32:39.150 --> 32:41.239
You know, because, like,
I could give her the money,

32:41.240 --> 32:43.679
but she could just make copies
and distribute the pictures.

32:43.680 --> 32:47.039
So Adam asked around, and
Ashley and a few other stars

32:47.040 --> 32:48.361
said that you do stuff.

32:48.362 --> 32:50.614
I do stuff?

32:50.615 --> 32:54.049
I'm not saying kill her.

32:54.050 --> 32:57.580
You know, but... hurt her.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.999
Are you cool?

33:10.340 --> 33:12.760
- How old is this woman?
- She's really old.

33:12.770 --> 33:13.999
She's, like, 35.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.720
How old are you?

33:15.730 --> 33:16.800
Seventeen.

33:16.807 --> 33:18.469
You don't need my help.

33:18.470 --> 33:19.935
Why?

33:19.936 --> 33:22.938
She shows anyone those
pictures, she goes to jail.

33:22.939 --> 33:24.829
For extortion, right?

33:24.830 --> 33:26.860
No, for statutory rape.

33:28.069 --> 33:30.279
You know what statutory rape is, right?

33:30.280 --> 33:32.320
Yeah.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.449
She raped me.

33:36.450 --> 33:38.919
- I didn't say that.
- She should fucking pay me.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.163
- That's not what I said.
- Fuck!

33:40.164 --> 33:42.839
- What I said...
- Okay, right on.

33:42.840 --> 33:45.160
- Okay.
- I'm a victim.

33:45.170 --> 33:46.900
Thank you.

33:53.180 --> 33:55.159
Got three weeks to
produce this kid's record,

33:55.160 --> 33:57.459
and he cannot stop...

33:57.460 --> 34:00.419
anyway, uh, what do I owe you?

34:00.420 --> 34:01.840
Don't worry about it.

34:01.850 --> 34:03.437
I appreciate everything
you're doing for Bridget.

34:03.438 --> 34:05.640
Thank you.

34:12.822 --> 34:15.339
I found a problem.

34:15.340 --> 34:17.618
- What's up?
- One of the heads came up.

34:17.619 --> 34:18.759
Came up?

34:18.760 --> 34:21.099
Yeah, a fisherman
hooked it in the sound.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.498
Which one?

34:25.500 --> 34:27.239
It was the big guy with
the bullet in his head.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.139
Oh, my God.

34:29.170 --> 34:30.918
Oh, my God.

34:30.920 --> 34:32.089
Ohh!

34:32.090 --> 34:34.079
I'm gonna go to fucking prison.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.458
You're not going to prison.

34:35.460 --> 34:37.804
I'm gonna go to prison
for the rest of my life.

34:37.804 --> 34:41.489
Ah. I gotta call Bridget.

34:45.550 --> 34:46.679
What do you think?

34:48.199 --> 34:50.859
I'll get ahead of it.

34:50.860 --> 34:53.520
All right.

35:15.900 --> 35:17.300
You came.

35:17.303 --> 35:19.305
Yeah.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.480
Wonderful.

35:29.100 --> 35:31.100
Yeah, all right.

35:31.108 --> 35:33.277
Give me your phone.

35:36.780 --> 35:39.370
Trust me, you won't want it.

35:41.285 --> 35:43.319
Join us.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.720
Pick any mat you like.

36:10.898 --> 36:13.919
First time?

36:13.920 --> 36:15.269
Yeah.

36:15.270 --> 36:17.699
If I were you, I would choose a spot

36:17.700 --> 36:19.115
closer to the bathroom.

36:43.380 --> 36:45.000
Detective.

36:46.640 --> 36:49.770
Ballistics came back on Albert Clancy.

36:55.620 --> 36:57.569
A Taurus nine millimeter.

36:57.570 --> 36:59.179
Yep.

36:59.180 --> 37:00.960
All right.

37:26.400 --> 37:29.699
I got a gun and two big dogs.

37:29.700 --> 37:31.459
It's Ray.

37:31.460 --> 37:35.119
Jesus fuck, Ray.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.564
Couldn't you have waited another minute

37:37.565 --> 37:39.640
without vandalizing my property?

37:39.650 --> 37:41.979
Sorry, I need Mick's gun.

37:41.980 --> 37:44.859
I'm in the middle of something here.

37:44.860 --> 37:47.319
Ruin my afternoon, why don't you?

37:47.320 --> 37:49.219
Jesus Christ.

37:50.400 --> 37:54.620
- Where is it?
- It's this way, I think.

37:56.480 --> 37:59.139
- Let me see.
- That's not it.

37:59.140 --> 38:01.709
That ain't it.

38:04.270 --> 38:06.580
Guns! Guns!

38:06.600 --> 38:08.760
Guns! Guns!

38:08.770 --> 38:10.679
Will you stop, please?

38:10.680 --> 38:13.690
Aye-aye, Captain Crunch.

38:16.850 --> 38:20.560
Oh, yeah, that's the one.

38:20.570 --> 38:23.697
Thanks, Aunt Sandy.

39:14.990 --> 39:17.000
Let's go, load up.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.819
All the way to the back.

39:21.820 --> 39:24.059
Good.

39:55.940 --> 39:57.199
What are you doing here?

39:57.200 --> 39:59.439
I heard.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.760
You heard what?

40:00.770 --> 40:02.212
I heard about the heads.

40:03.680 --> 40:05.420
Okay.

40:06.860 --> 40:08.619
What are you gonna do?

40:08.620 --> 40:10.159
Not your problem, Bridge.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.819
What are you gonna do?

40:12.820 --> 40:14.080
Dad!

40:15.330 --> 40:16.974
Mick's gonna take the rap.

40:16.975 --> 40:19.359
I've got his gun, we're
gonna put his prints on it.

40:19.360 --> 40:20.439
You think he'll do that?

40:20.440 --> 40:22.279
Yeah.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.219
Oh, thank God you're here.

40:25.903 --> 40:28.490
Hey.

40:29.573 --> 40:32.699
Oh, God, I'm so... I'm so scared.

40:32.700 --> 40:35.239
Dad's gonna take care of it.

40:35.240 --> 40:37.623
Yeah, he will. Thanks, Dad.

40:45.881 --> 40:47.466
You get it?

40:51.780 --> 40:53.764
Mick should hold this
with his thumb, index

40:53.765 --> 40:55.079
and middle finger.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.619
You bring this back to me
and I'm gonna transfer

40:56.620 --> 40:57.920
the prints onto that gun.

40:59.186 --> 41:00.850
Be careful with it.

41:10.840 --> 41:14.479
Hey, you ever been to max before?

41:14.480 --> 41:16.839
Yeah.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.260
I ain't never been.

41:19.830 --> 41:24.086
You got a valuable skill,
kid, keep you safe.

41:25.540 --> 41:27.740
But is it really that bad?

41:28.940 --> 41:30.319
Yeah.

41:30.320 --> 41:33.299
So you do what you have to do.

41:48.820 --> 41:51.039
That's right.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.839
The demons are leaving.

42:09.560 --> 42:12.499
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

42:12.500 --> 42:14.640
Will it hold it now?

42:21.430 --> 42:22.978
Oh, man, hold on.

42:24.680 --> 42:27.120
Different screwdriver.

42:30.040 --> 42:32.079
It rusted all the way through.

42:32.080 --> 42:33.439
That one bolt.

42:33.440 --> 42:35.860
Look at this fucking fat fuck.

42:50.270 --> 42:52.715
Yeah.

42:52.716 --> 42:55.511
- Hey, I just heard from Lena.
- Yeah?

42:55.512 --> 42:57.919
Yo, you got this, Ray, right?

42:57.920 --> 42:59.199
I mean, you got this?

42:59.200 --> 43:01.517
I got it.

43:33.280 --> 43:35.250
- I think that's good.
- Yeah.

44:02.660 --> 44:04.870
Here to see Michael Donovan.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.670
I don't see a Michael Donovan.

44:14.673 --> 44:17.279
Arriving today, up from Rikers.

44:19.680 --> 44:21.219
Yeah, he's due.

44:21.220 --> 44:23.759
Bus hasn't gotten here yet.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.699
Is it all right if I wait here?

44:25.700 --> 44:27.143
Knock yourself out.

44:27.144 --> 44:29.730
Thanks.

47:33.450 --> 47:34.700
The fuck is that?

47:35.960 --> 47:39.499
Oh, God.

47:39.500 --> 47:40.829
Oh, God!
