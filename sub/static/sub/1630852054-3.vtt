00:23.524 --> 00:25.393
<i>Previously on</i> Ghost...

00:25.426 --> 00:27.628
Stansfield is having
a publicity problem.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.064
<i>What better place
to dig up dirt on Sweeney?</i>

00:30.097 --> 00:31.298
<i>You know he's friends
with the Westons.</i>

00:31.332 --> 00:34.502
My old college roommate,
Congressman Rick Sweeney.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.370
I'm blessed to announce
that I will be entering

00:36.404 --> 00:38.038
the NBA draft this year.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.073
They found their suspect.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.641
- Who is it?
- Carrie Milgram.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.209
But she's not a murderer.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.711
Where were you on the night
of Jabari Reynolds' murder?

00:43.744 --> 00:44.779
Zeke was here.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.614
- Ezekiel Cross.

00:46.647 --> 00:47.782
I'm recording you.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.183
Take you downtown
for some questions.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.618
I'ma need you to handle
the product alone.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.586
You trust me to do that?

00:52.620 --> 00:53.654
Yo, what happened to him?

00:53.687 --> 00:56.090
He got caught
with fake product--ours.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.224
We need a new connect.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.492
Might be able
to help out with that.

00:58.526 --> 01:01.595
If Cane's offering product,
you need to take it.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.497
Yeah, I didn't think it was
gonna be like this, Renzo.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.099
<i>I need more.</i>

01:05.132 --> 01:06.634
- I needed to see you again.
- It's too late.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.335
Just in case
you change your mind.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.237
Yas, what's going on?

01:10.271 --> 01:12.573
I should be allowed
to have a drink or two.

01:12.606 --> 01:13.841
She's going
to a really good home.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.309
Tariq!

01:15.342 --> 01:18.112
You're going to need someone
with a lot of influence.

01:18.145 --> 01:21.449
You wouldn't happen
to know any Westons, do you?

03:35.282 --> 03:36.450

You know damn well
these sad motherfuckers

03:37.851 --> 03:39.453
are dead to you after tonight.

03:39.486 --> 03:40.821
Just between you and me,
Rashad.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.224
<i>All right, everybody,
let's raise our glasses</i>

03:44.258 --> 03:46.393
to Detective Investigator
Kamaal Tate.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.495
- Thank you very much.
Cheers.

03:48.529 --> 03:51.265
Hey, think you got
the wrong event, kid.

03:51.298 --> 03:54.268
Oh, no, I'm-I'm here
to see my, um--my uncle,

03:54.301 --> 03:55.436
<i>Councilman Tate.</i>

03:55.469 --> 03:57.371
You're related
to Councilman Tate?

03:57.404 --> 03:59.740
Chief Bozeman, I really
appreciate your diligence.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.408
I know this young man.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.577
- Councilman.
Mm-hmm.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.346
Tariq, what the fuck
are you doing here?

04:05.379 --> 04:07.548
- Uh, we need to talk.
- Talk?

04:07.581 --> 04:09.383
Nigga, this ain't
the Breakfast Club.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.684
You know
where you are right now?

04:10.718 --> 04:12.319
Look, I need
some of your connections.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.921
Child Services got my sister,
and I need you

04:13.954 --> 04:16.390
to get someone over there
to speak to me.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.392
Yeah, I can.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.893
But what will you do
for me, Tariq?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.428
Hmm?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.430
I'm gonna need a little quid
from you before I can quo.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.832
Talk to me.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.268
You mentioned that you know
one of the Westons, right?

04:29.003 --> 04:31.338
Yes.
Brayden Weston is my roommate.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.806
How well does he know
Rick Sweeney?

04:33.841 --> 04:35.709
That fuckin' cocksucker.

04:35.743 --> 04:39.546
Ah, I love when we're on
the same side of a question.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.715
Can you use your relationship
with this Brayden

04:41.749 --> 04:44.418
to get me some information
on Sweeney?

04:44.451 --> 04:46.053
He has something
that belongs to me.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.521
What's that?

04:47.554 --> 04:48.856
A congressional seat.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.558
Now, if you get
something for me

04:51.592 --> 04:53.460
that cancels him out of office,

04:53.494 --> 04:55.062
then I can get you your sister.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.297
How the fuck do you
expect me to do that?

04:57.331 --> 04:59.500
Don't sell yourself
so short, young brother.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.369
We both know
what you're capable of.

05:05.673 --> 05:06.807
A'ight.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.910
Just give me a little time
to figure that shit out.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.478
But I need my sister now.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.314
I can help you now, on credit.

05:15.449 --> 05:18.318
But you gotta get me back
with interest.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.787
Are we clear?

05:19.820 --> 05:20.954
Yeah, I got you.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.556
All right. I'll make the call.

05:22.589 --> 05:23.924
Go down to CPS in the morning.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.427
I'll make sure
that they see you.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.961
Now get the hell outta here
before these boys

05:27.995 --> 05:30.364
sober up enough
to arrest your Black ass.

05:30.397 --> 05:31.432
Mm.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.801
Go on, kick rocks,
little nigga.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.003
Ah, thanks
for coming by, nephew.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.472
Love you.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.773
Hey, where's my drink?

06:01.061 --> 06:02.563
He ain't here yet?

06:03.530 --> 06:04.998
He's late.

06:13.107 --> 06:15.375
- Does Papi know I'm back yet?
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:15.409 --> 06:17.444
And he's gonna know
if you fuck it up too.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.948
Hey, you late, nigga.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.051
What's he doing here?

06:24.084 --> 06:26.687
He belongs here.
Cane found a new connect.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.956
So we all back
in business together.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.591
Now, whatever beef
y'all still got going,

06:30.624 --> 06:32.960
y'all need to squash
that shit right now.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.731
Y'all hear me?

06:40.801 --> 06:42.002
So you trust him again?

06:42.035 --> 06:43.637
I need product, and so do you.

06:43.670 --> 06:44.838
This is what's best
for all of us.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.775
The greater good.
You get that, don't you?

06:47.808 --> 06:49.810
- Yeah.
- Good.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.111
And, Cane,
don't be fuckin' with him

06:51.145 --> 06:53.580
and the way
he does business, period.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.182
- Yes, ma'am.
- A'ight.

06:55.415 --> 06:58.719
Whoa, hold up, hold up.
I need the money up front.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.154
Oh, you don't trust me
all of a sudden?

07:00.187 --> 07:02.122
New connect, new rules.

07:02.156 --> 07:04.057
Fucking mess.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.560
Make sure
you run me my shit back.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.028
I got you.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.204
You frame
that teacher bitch yet?

07:17.437 --> 07:19.439
I didn't even have to do
all that shit.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.842
- We good.
Yeah, we better be.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.010
'Cause if them bodies
come back on me,

07:23.043 --> 07:24.478
I come down on you,

07:24.511 --> 07:27.214
no matter what Monet says
about no greater good.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.749
Listen, nigga,
you stay outta jail

07:28.782 --> 07:30.484
and I stay outta jail,
all right?

07:30.517 --> 07:32.920
We in this shit together,
that's the greater good.

07:32.953 --> 07:36.190
Yeah, whatever.
I'll have the shit tomorrow.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.825
Make sure you have
Monet's money.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.060
I heard what she said
before she left, nigga.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.096
All this shit I be doing
for this family,

07:43.130 --> 07:45.098
and the niggas can't even
offer me a ride.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.107
<i>My man.</i>
- Yo, Mecca.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.642
- You made it.
I did.

07:55.676 --> 07:56.810
- All right.
We up and running.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.011
All right.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.246
<i>Anybody wanna help
the nigga out?</i>

08:03.150 --> 08:04.218
Mec!

08:04.251 --> 08:06.086
<i>Fuck, man!</i>

08:06.119 --> 08:08.555
Mec!

08:08.589 --> 08:09.923
To the left, man.

08:09.957 --> 08:13.193
<i>Another step forward. Bam.</i>

08:20.801 --> 08:22.169
<i>Party favors.</i>

08:24.705 --> 08:26.039
<i>Feliz cumpleaños,</i> Nuff.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.074
Yo, let's go!

08:27.107 --> 08:28.842
Let's fucking go!

08:36.183 --> 08:37.885
Cane, get over here, man.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.519
What up? What up?
- This is my boy Nuff.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.588
I told you about him, right?
Nuff, this is Cane.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.156
He's helping us expand
into more territory.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.525
- What's happening, playboy?
- What up? What up?

08:45.559 --> 08:46.693
So this how you throw
a damn party, huh?

08:46.727 --> 08:48.061
Man, you better pace yourself.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.164
<i>Hey, I gotta take this,
but, uh, Cane,</i>

08:51.198 --> 08:52.733
<i>fix yourself a plate, man.</i>

08:52.766 --> 08:54.167
My place is your place.
My family.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.637
Fire, Chef. For real.

08:56.670 --> 08:57.938
Close your mouth when you chew.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.807
Cane, how you know Mec?

09:00.841 --> 09:02.776
<i>I met him through my boy Guap.</i>

09:02.809 --> 09:05.979
Mec used to run the hood
same time as his dad.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.247
<i>So he knew him
before he went to Kuwait.</i>

09:07.281 --> 09:09.883
Hey, girls. Come over here.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.251
This the birthday boy.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.054
What's up? You ready?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.728
Open wide.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.703
Mecca, you getting in
on this shit?

09:29.736 --> 09:32.339
Don't worry about that nigga.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.642
Man been a lost cause
since we got to New York.

09:35.676 --> 09:36.944
What you mean?

09:36.977 --> 09:39.913
He's had a hard-on
for some bitch.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.183
Don't you know
that there's a difference

09:43.216 --> 09:45.886
between my business

09:45.919 --> 09:47.955
and family business?

09:47.988 --> 09:48.989
Huh?

10:02.970 --> 10:04.671
Sorry about that, Janae.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.173
He'll be back online
in a minute.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.641
For now,
why don't you help, uh,

10:07.674 --> 10:09.376
Zindzi out with my boy Cane?

10:09.609 --> 10:13.046
It's a party, y'all.
Feel the love.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.892
Detective Whitman, uh,
you know,

10:58.925 --> 11:02.429
I got practice in the morning.
so whatever you need to ask me,

11:02.662 --> 11:04.765
can you just ask me
so I can go?

11:04.798 --> 11:06.066
You didn't seem
so worried about practice

11:06.099 --> 11:08.435
when I grabbed you.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.137
Looked like you were putting
your work in already.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.106
Yeah, uh,
Coach is expecting me, so...

11:14.841 --> 11:17.077
What sport do you play?

11:17.110 --> 11:21.214
Basketball.
I mean, I'm Zeke Cross.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.685
I just declared for the draft
a couple of days ago.

11:25.719 --> 11:26.987
I don't really
follow basketball,

11:27.020 --> 11:28.955
but, uh, that's great for you.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.926
So, what, do you just do
a few laps in college

11:32.959 --> 11:34.761
before you're off
to your new life, right?

11:34.795 --> 11:36.463
I mean, it's not like that.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.399
No? You like school?

11:39.433 --> 11:41.201
Uh, what do you like about it?

11:41.234 --> 11:44.704
You like your friends?
Like your girlfriend?

11:46.773 --> 11:48.742
Yeah, I like school.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.210
Did you know Jabari Reynolds?

11:50.243 --> 11:51.912
The professor? Nah.

11:51.945 --> 11:55.749
Uh, he wasn't my advisor.

11:55.782 --> 11:58.952
Oh, okay. Who was your advisor?

11:58.985 --> 12:03.356
Carrie--I mean
Professor Caridad Milgram.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.928
Can you describe
your relationship with her?

12:09.463 --> 12:11.231
That's it. She's my advisor.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.400
Can I get a phone call?
I need to call my aunt.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.469
Like, what's going on?
Like, I've been here for hours.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.771
Hey, hey, you're not-you're not
under arrest, okay?

12:17.804 --> 12:19.406
I don't want you to go
worrying your auntie.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.974
<i>We'll be done soon.</i>

12:21.007 --> 12:23.410
<i>Hey, you- you declared
for the draft, right? Whoo.</i>

12:23.443 --> 12:26.746
I mean, can you imagine
if the press found out

12:26.780 --> 12:28.381
<i>you were in here for hours?</i>

12:28.415 --> 12:31.852
What kind of rumors
might that start?

12:31.885 --> 12:33.453
That could hurt
your draft prospects.

12:33.487 --> 12:34.855
But I didn't do anything.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.523
And that's what
I'm gonna tell 'em

12:36.756 --> 12:37.924
if you cooperate.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.092
<i>Let's just finish up,</i>

12:39.126 --> 12:40.527
<i>get you back to Stansfield.</i>

12:40.760 --> 12:42.062
I'm cooperating.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.166
Good.
Just a few more questions.

12:46.199 --> 12:49.769
About you and, uh,
about Carrie.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.882

Damn, you already up at it?

13:31.945 --> 13:34.014
Play hard, work harder.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.550
I had Nuff take the product
to your car.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.019
You sure your family
can move all that?

13:39.052 --> 13:40.420
Yeah, Monet can handle that.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.155
And she paid you up front.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.357
Yeah, well...

13:44.391 --> 13:47.861
Guap said Monet took
your product off the street.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.462
So where you gonna sell
my shit?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.064
Fucking Guap.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.133
Man, you know Guap
got radio mouth.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.601
- Monet ain't like that shit.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.604
She wanted the business
to stay under the radar.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.607
So she runs it to this
Steve Urkel-ass nigga

14:00.840 --> 14:02.008
up at Stansfield.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.043
Uh-huh.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.346
Right.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.950
And what's your problem
with him?

14:09.983 --> 14:13.553
I mean, Monet's right.
His system keeps us invisible.

14:13.587 --> 14:15.388
But she don't know
what he's doing up there.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.557
So you don't like it
'cause you don't have control.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.159
Mm.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.594
- You don't trust him?
Nope.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.095
So what's his name?

14:25.565 --> 14:27.934
You don't trust me either.

14:29.469 --> 14:33.373
Well, I don't work with people
who don't trust me, Cane.

14:34.874 --> 14:39.379
I just showed you
my whole fucking life, man.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.248
All my peoples.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.052
You know what? It's cool.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.022
You don't wanna give me
the name, there's the door.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.557
I'll see you around.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.067
Tariq St. Patrick.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.104
Uh-huh.

15:05.905 --> 15:10.210
And you need to be able to
control this Tariq St. Patrick.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.279
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Okay.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.513
Well, maybe I can help.

15:16.116 --> 15:19.152
I am offering you a hand.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.588
I know you're too smart
to turn your back on that.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.257
Right?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.966
Tate made me
give you 15 minutes.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.702
That's all you got. Go.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.004
Okay. Yas belongs with me.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.706
Your sister needs
to be in a grounded,

15:39.939 --> 15:41.574
safe, stable environment.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.209
And I can provide that.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.611
In a college dorm?

15:46.646 --> 15:49.215
Look,
she's with a great family.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.451
One of my favorites,
the Royces.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.952
She'll stay there
till we see what happens

15:52.986 --> 15:54.154
with your grandmother.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.322
But my grandmother's
the problem.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.656
She-she's unstable.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.425
Maybe if I get an apartment,

15:58.458 --> 15:59.993
then can Yas will stay with me?

16:00.026 --> 16:01.227
An apartment?

16:03.596 --> 16:07.467
You'll also need a stable job,
proof of income,

16:07.500 --> 16:09.202
a clean drug
and criminal record.

16:09.235 --> 16:10.970
Yeah, I can do all of that.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.207
You couldn't even
get this meeting on your own.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.679
Trust me, money and influence
can buy a lot of things.

16:19.713 --> 16:22.382
But it can't buy
what's good for a child.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.757
I told you.

16:30.990 --> 16:35.028
I barely know Carrie Milgram,
and I don't know anything.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.599
I need to go to practice.
I-I can't help you.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.034
You're free to go at any time.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.168
You keep saying that,

16:42.202 --> 16:43.370
but you have my wallet
and my phone.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.438
Just gotta say the word.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.574
I mean, this fucker's
been ringing off the hook.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.676
It's probably my auntie.
Now she's looking for me.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.512
Oh, uh, your auntie?

16:52.545 --> 16:54.647
Does she know about
your relationship with Carrie?

16:54.681 --> 16:57.384
- Should I pick up and ask her?
- No, there is no relationship.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.651
Look.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.289
I understand
why you'd hesitate to admit it.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.625
If your school finds out,
she loses her job.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.794
But in the eyes of the law,
nobody fucking cares.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.430
You're both adults.
It's not a crime.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.365
You know what is a crime?

17:12.399 --> 17:15.101
Lying to the police during
a criminal investigation.

17:16.302 --> 17:17.771
I need you
to tell me the truth.

17:20.106 --> 17:21.808
Today we'll be discussing

17:22.041 --> 17:25.645
Jeremy Bentham's theories
on utilitarianism.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.147
- I was thinking we could--
- I'd like to take this one

17:27.180 --> 17:29.149
if you'll allow me,
Professor Milgram.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.718
<i>Sure.</i>
Thank you.

17:33.787 --> 17:36.656
Is there
an objective greater good?

17:36.689 --> 17:39.426
<i>It's a question that's played
a vital role in my dedication</i>

17:39.459 --> 17:41.828
<i>to a career in public service.</i>

17:42.061 --> 17:44.697
You see, Rashad Tate is

17:44.731 --> 17:48.268
and will always be
for the people.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.203
<i>And that includes all of you.</i>

17:50.236 --> 17:51.805
Be it better education,

17:51.838 --> 17:53.506
cancellation of student debt,
creating--

17:53.540 --> 17:57.410
The act
that's purely in service

17:57.444 --> 17:59.212
of your voting base--

17:59.245 --> 18:02.782
or potential voting base--
negates its subjectivity.

18:02.816 --> 18:05.285
Go off,
Professor Milgram, okay?

18:05.318 --> 18:07.420
<i>But he has a point.</i>

18:07.454 --> 18:10.223
Bentham argues that
an act's utility determines

18:10.256 --> 18:11.858
whether it's good or bad.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.359
What keeps the many happy

18:13.393 --> 18:15.829
is objectively
the greatest act.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.531
Ugh. A colonizer
would say that shit.

18:18.565 --> 18:19.632
Excuse me?

18:19.666 --> 18:21.167
Slavery was promoted

18:21.201 --> 18:23.169
as being in the interest
of the many.

18:23.203 --> 18:26.506
Sure did make your
colonizing ancestors happy too.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.441
Okay, but Bentham
acknowledges that utility

18:28.475 --> 18:30.577
and its outcome
is always changing.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.612
We have to leave room
for moral evolution.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.614
Mm, that sounds like
a slight justification

18:34.647 --> 18:36.616
- for slavery to me, Luis.
- Mm. Slight.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.151
<i>And that's assuming
we all operate off</i>

18:38.184 --> 18:39.719
the same moral code.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.387
I've been to some of
your frat brothers' parties.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.689
I'd speak to them on that one.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.824
- Ooh! Shh!
- Had fun, huh?

18:44.858 --> 18:48.495
So, Lauren, you don't think
that there's a basic moral code

18:48.528 --> 18:52.265
which we adhere to that informs
the overall greater good?

18:52.298 --> 18:53.399
No.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.135
Well, what if you knew
that BruShaundria

18:56.169 --> 18:57.804
would one day be
a serial killer?

18:57.837 --> 18:58.905
Why me?

18:59.138 --> 19:01.174
Would that justify
murdering her now?

19:02.675 --> 19:04.544
I think that any act
that infringes

19:04.577 --> 19:07.447
<i>upon someone's way of being
or happiness is wrong.</i>

19:07.480 --> 19:11.651
It's stripped of the mantle of
being the greater good, period.

19:11.684 --> 19:12.919
I wouldn't kill BruShaundria.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.454
You mean you don't
wanna get merc'd

19:14.487 --> 19:15.688
in self-defense.

19:15.722 --> 19:16.890
Well, let's find out, shall we?

19:16.923 --> 19:19.392
Don't play with me.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.731
So there are
fundamental truths,

19:24.764 --> 19:27.400
virtues that lift mankind

19:27.433 --> 19:30.937
in which we can measure
objectivity of an action

19:31.170 --> 19:34.240
in service of a greater good.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.209
Do you see Jackie's point,
Lauren?

19:39.245 --> 19:41.381
- I mean--
- In leaving room for virtue,

19:41.414 --> 19:44.217
you often risk missing an
objectively greater good act.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.351
<i>Sometimes if you don't eliminate</i>

19:45.385 --> 19:46.719
<i>the concept of morality,</i>

19:46.753 --> 19:48.788
you risk everybody
taking a loss.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.823
How's that in the interest
of the greater good?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.893
Young man has a point.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.562
I mean, are you really saying

19:55.595 --> 19:56.963
there's not a single
good outcome

19:57.196 --> 19:58.698
<i>you'd rather not risk</i>

19:58.731 --> 20:00.967
<i>just to preserve
your virtue, Professor?</i>

20:01.200 --> 20:02.869
We can fucking
do this all day!

20:02.902 --> 20:04.470
I think they went
to school together

20:04.504 --> 20:05.905
or college or something.

20:05.939 --> 20:07.640
- That's all I know.
- You know what I think?

20:07.674 --> 20:09.375
I think that he found out
about you two.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.877
She had him killed
to shut him up.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.980
There's nothing
to find out about.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.716
Look, I don't mean to be rude,
but like you said,

20:16.749 --> 20:18.985
she's way older than me.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.555
She's hot and very available.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.357
You know I used
to work with her, right?

20:26.593 --> 20:28.928
Very, very, very generous.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.496
She enjoys it too.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.601
You know what I mean?

20:34.634 --> 20:36.502
Nah, I don't know
what you mean.

20:36.536 --> 20:37.870
Oh, I mean that just--
I mean, Carrie

20:37.904 --> 20:40.740
was never one
to focus on one guy, right?

20:40.773 --> 20:42.475
Wasn't her style.

20:42.508 --> 20:44.544
That's not true.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.012
She's not the type.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.314
<i>Oh, she was
Jabari Reynolds' type.</i>

20:48.348 --> 20:50.717
Back in the day, but sure.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.353
You know, he wrote
a book about her or something.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.425
You don't know.
No, he got back in.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.029
<i>Oh yeah, it's been
a couple of months,</i>

21:03.262 --> 21:05.398
I mean,
up until he died, of course.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.433
That's not true.

21:07.467 --> 21:08.901
Apparently, he was very jealous

21:08.935 --> 21:10.603
over someone else
she was seeing.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.906
<i>You sure you don't know
anything about that?</i>

21:13.940 --> 21:15.775
<i>♪ ♪</i>

21:15.808 --> 21:16.809
No.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.513
So you weren't with her
the night he was killed?

21:24.617 --> 21:26.719
<i>That's gotta be
my auntie or-or my coach.</i>

21:26.753 --> 21:28.388
<i>You made me miss practice.</i>

21:29.622 --> 21:32.025
This is not your auntie.

21:35.028 --> 21:37.463
Were you in a sexual
relationship with her?

21:37.497 --> 21:38.564
Hmm?

21:40.433 --> 21:42.435
Is she calling
to get you to lie for her?

21:45.304 --> 21:47.774
Were you with Carrie Milgram
at her apartment

21:47.807 --> 21:49.976
the night Jabari Reynolds
was killed?

21:55.014 --> 21:56.015
No.

21:58.518 --> 22:03.489
I wasn't with Carrie the night
Jabari Reynolds was killed.

22:09.362 --> 22:11.964
Can I go, please?

22:14.600 --> 22:15.868
No.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.837
<i>You need to hang tight
for a little longer.</i>

22:17.870 --> 22:19.105
<i>I'm gonna check something out.</i>

22:19.338 --> 22:22.809
In the meantime,
I'll have an officer come in.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.744
Help you call your auntie.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.523
So how did the meeting go?

22:37.557 --> 22:39.425
She basically told me
to fuck off.

22:39.459 --> 22:41.494
You're 19
and your sister needs a home.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.496
- It's a big ask.
- I mean, I understand,

22:43.529 --> 22:45.064
but I need to see
my sister, man.

22:45.098 --> 22:46.399
I need to see Yasmine.

22:46.432 --> 22:47.834
I gave her my word, and...

22:47.867 --> 22:49.669
it might not mean a lot to you,
but that's my little sister.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.370
You know...

22:51.404 --> 22:54.107
I like that it means
something to you, Tariq.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.475
Since you gave me your word

22:55.508 --> 22:57.877
that you'll help me out
with Sweeney.

22:57.910 --> 23:00.446
Now, I know that he and Weston
have been friends

23:00.480 --> 23:02.381
since their college days here.

23:02.415 --> 23:03.983
There's gotta be
something on 'em.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.852
I-I know it.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.421
I don't know.
He looks like a closet freak.

23:08.454 --> 23:09.689
But I need proof.

23:09.722 --> 23:13.426
I'm thinking Eliot Spitzer,
Anthony Weiner.

23:13.459 --> 23:14.727
Real creepy type shit.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.529
That's the kind of dirt
I need, Tariq.

23:16.562 --> 23:17.563
A'ight, look, I'll get it.

23:17.597 --> 23:18.598
But I need you
to find my sister.

23:18.631 --> 23:19.832
An address or something.

23:19.866 --> 23:22.568
Then I'll get you
whatever you want, okay?

23:22.602 --> 23:24.036
Well, young brother...

23:26.072 --> 23:27.874
...that's my kind of deal.

23:34.514 --> 23:35.515
<i>All right.</i>

23:46.959 --> 23:49.095
- Hey.
What's up?

23:49.128 --> 23:51.798
Um, thanks for helping me out
in there.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.533
Of course.

23:53.566 --> 23:57.203
Listen, uh, last night,
sorry I bolted on you.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.807
I'm just--I feel like
you're always preoccupied.

24:00.840 --> 24:04.744
No, it's-it's just, I got a lot
of things going on, and...

24:08.147 --> 24:10.783
I gotta-I gotta take this.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.451
You always do.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.124
Fuck.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.029
Bash.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.163
<i>Tariq, what can I do</i>

24:24.197 --> 24:25.765
<i>for my favorite
minority partner?</i>

24:25.798 --> 24:27.600
I need a legitimate paycheck.

24:27.633 --> 24:28.968
No problem,
we'll form a new LLC

24:29.001 --> 24:30.570
and run you a paycheck
through it.

24:30.603 --> 24:31.838
A'ight,
it'll look legit, right?

24:31.871 --> 24:33.239
<i>You're questioning
my business acumen.</i>

24:33.472 --> 24:34.874
- I'm insulted.
<i>No, I mean, you know.</i>

24:34.907 --> 24:36.108
I'll have my lawyers
draw up the papers.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.677
All you'll need
is someone to sign on

24:37.710 --> 24:39.879
as president of the corporation
- and a 30
- K down payment.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.147
Bash, what?

24:41.180 --> 24:43.149
You gotta be kidding me,
bro, 30 bands?

24:43.182 --> 24:44.517
There are strict
transaction fees

24:44.550 --> 24:46.052
at the bank of Stern and Stern.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.987
A'ight, you'll get your money.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.255
Why can't I be the president?

24:49.488 --> 24:50.857
<i>You want an IRS audit?
I don't.</i>

24:50.890 --> 24:52.792
<i>We need to make this
look clean, even if it's not.</i>

24:52.825 --> 24:54.594
- A'ight.
- Find someone you trust.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.529
I'll call you
when the papers are ready.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.673
Niggas really think
they in <i>The Fast and Furious</i>

25:07.707 --> 25:09.008
and shit.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.943
You ain't tell me you was
bringin' white boy with you.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.078
I brought him.

25:12.111 --> 25:13.212
Man, we spent
a whole evening together,

25:13.246 --> 25:14.881
which was your choice,
not mine.

25:14.914 --> 25:18.117
I'm still white boy to you?
That's fucked up, Cane.

25:18.150 --> 25:20.887
Is that the product?
Come to Daddy.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.288
Yo, you buggin' if you think

25:22.521 --> 25:24.624
I'm givin' your stomped-out ass
any of my fuckin' product.

25:24.657 --> 25:25.958
Fuck you mean, nigga?
Just give him the bags.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.093
Look, you of all people know

25:27.126 --> 25:28.694
I can move weight, Cane.
What the fuck?

25:31.530 --> 25:32.999
You know what?

25:33.032 --> 25:34.233
You and Machine Gun Kelly
over here

25:34.267 --> 25:35.635
fuck up Monet's business,

25:35.668 --> 25:37.870
<i>I'ma just take it back
to the streets.</i>

25:37.904 --> 25:39.038
Whoa, the streets,
that's an option?

25:39.071 --> 25:41.007
Nah, we're staying
right where we are, B.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.009
I really can't wait
for y'all to fuck this up.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.278
Continue to wait.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.113
Thank you.

25:52.251 --> 25:53.920
<i>Yo, don't listen
to that nigga, man.</i>

25:53.953 --> 25:55.688
<i>We can't keep switching up
how we doing shit</i>

25:55.721 --> 25:57.256
now that I gotta get
my sister, bro.

25:57.290 --> 25:58.991
Well, how much
do we need to get her back?

25:59.025 --> 26:00.293
I ain't gonna lie, a lot.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.762
Fucker Bash is asking
for 30 bands.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.764
Gotta make some bread.

26:04.797 --> 26:07.099
Say no more.
You know I got you, fam.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.135
You know that spot
that you showed me?

26:09.168 --> 26:10.770
I did a little redecorating.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.571
<i>-You're gonna love this.</i>

26:12.605 --> 26:14.106
Scan that, right there.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.975
What?
- Yeah. The brick, right there.

26:20.346 --> 26:23.082
What the fuck?
This what you been working on?

26:23.115 --> 26:26.018
One of our tutors did some
- sick shit with a 3
- D printer.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.720
She took out a few old bricks,

26:27.753 --> 26:29.956
- replaced 'em with retrofitted3 -D lockers.

26:29.989 --> 26:33.192
Both columns,
fully functional storage.

26:33.225 --> 26:34.260
<i>So, what, every tutor got</i>

26:34.293 --> 26:35.728
<i>their own code or some shit?</i>

26:35.761 --> 26:37.964
<i>Exactly.
Product in, cash out.</i>

26:37.997 --> 26:40.866
<i>You and I are the only ones
with the master QR.</i>

26:40.900 --> 26:42.735
<i>No more running around
and handing shit out,</i>

26:42.768 --> 26:45.204
<i>no more storing shit
in my parents' garage.</i>

26:46.238 --> 26:48.107
<i>One location for everything.</i>

26:49.608 --> 26:51.677
<i>When we want to expand,</i>

26:51.711 --> 26:53.813
<i>anybody, anywhere.</i>

27:00.119 --> 27:02.355
And the best part,
no one will know it's us.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.756
We'll be like
some fucking ghosts.

27:05.758 --> 27:08.027
- This shit is fire, man.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.196
<i>We'll get some money
with this bitch.</i>

27:19.638 --> 27:22.408
<i>That white boy,
he's your way in.</i>

27:22.641 --> 27:24.276
I watched your meeting.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.380
Tariq's partner,
you know who he is?

27:27.413 --> 27:30.182
Yeah, he's some kind
of rich kid.

27:31.684 --> 27:34.787
That nigga is <i>the</i> rich kid,

27:34.820 --> 27:36.922
and he's known Tariq
for years now.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.825
He's hype, easy to control.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.428
Perfect for us.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.730
So you want me to get at Tariq
through Brayden?

27:44.764 --> 27:46.032
You wanna run Tariq,

27:46.065 --> 27:47.833
you need to cut him
at his soft spot,

27:47.867 --> 27:50.703
and that rich kid is it.

27:50.736 --> 27:53.239
You need to get Brayden
in your pocket.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.216
Does Daddy know Cane's back?

28:04.250 --> 28:05.351
You know what, Diana?

28:05.384 --> 28:06.752
I'm tired of y'all
running around here

28:06.786 --> 28:08.454
asking me "Daddy this"
and "Daddy that."

28:08.687 --> 28:10.923
You wanna know about Cane,
ask your father yourself.

28:10.956 --> 28:12.291
You want more responsibility?

28:12.324 --> 28:14.160
You wanna be the one
askin' all the questions?

28:14.193 --> 28:16.162
Here.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.931
You go deal with your father.

28:18.964 --> 28:19.965
Fine.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.140
Hey.

28:30.743 --> 28:33.813
Um, what's the Wi-Fi passcode
again?

28:36.982 --> 28:39.018
It's on your wall, Councilman.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.186
In your office.

28:43.456 --> 28:46.292
Is there something I've done
to offend you, Professor?

28:46.325 --> 28:47.793
I certainly hope not, because

28:47.827 --> 28:51.297
I would love for us
to be friends.

28:52.298 --> 28:55.835
Oh, I think you've done nothing
but be yourself, Rashad.

28:55.868 --> 29:00.005
You know, I think if you and I
spent some time together alone,

29:00.039 --> 29:03.943
you'd really warm up
to my charm.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.512
Detective Whitman.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.214
I didn't think we had
a meeting scheduled.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.883
We don't, but we need to talk.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.518
Councilman,
may we have a minute?

29:12.751 --> 29:14.420
Ah, of course, Detective.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.288
You know, it's been a while
since I wore the uniform,

29:16.322 --> 29:17.857
but if there's anything
I can do

29:17.890 --> 29:21.193
to help the department,
please don't hesitate to ask.

29:21.227 --> 29:22.928
- Appreciate that.
- Mm-hmm.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.437
I have Zeke Cross
at the precinct.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.906
What? Why?

29:33.939 --> 29:35.207
Is he under arrest?

29:35.241 --> 29:37.776
He's saying you have a totally
professional relationship

29:37.810 --> 29:39.011
and that you two
were not together

29:39.044 --> 29:40.513
the night Jabari was murdered.

29:40.546 --> 29:43.816
Your alibi is up in smoke.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.784
You must have confused him.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.389
Did you put that kid up
to kill Jabari?

29:51.557 --> 29:53.492
Or he just figure it out
on his own?

29:53.526 --> 29:57.563
Kevin, we both know
this is personal.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.031
I know you wanna
pin this on me,

29:59.064 --> 30:00.432
but neither Zeke nor I

30:00.466 --> 30:02.835
had anything to do
with Jabari's murder.

30:02.868 --> 30:04.270
Really?

30:04.303 --> 30:06.872
Then why lie about your alibi?

30:06.906 --> 30:09.575
<i>Or is Zeke lying?</i>

30:09.808 --> 30:11.277
I'm not lying to you, Kevin.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.112
I know what you're capable of,
Carrie.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.915
I know the things
you can get a man to do.

30:18.450 --> 30:19.818
Just know that I won't rest

30:19.852 --> 30:21.420
until I put cuffs
on both of you

30:21.453 --> 30:23.155
and you pay
for what you've done.

30:38.904 --> 30:41.407
<i>Open five.
Prisoner coming through.</i>

30:52.017 --> 30:53.152
Hi daddy.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.154
Hello sweetheart.

31:02.261 --> 31:03.562
What are you doing here?

31:10.002 --> 31:11.337
What's going on, Diana?

31:12.504 --> 31:14.273
I was expecting Monet

31:16.208 --> 31:19.044
we have important business to discuss.

31:22.047 --> 31:24.550
That's why I'm here.

31:24.583 --> 31:27.253
I'm taking on more work now.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.587
But...

31:29.088 --> 31:31.590
did you know Ma brought Cane back?

31:32.057 --> 31:33.292
Of course I knew.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.027
It was my idea.

31:37.596 --> 31:39.098
Listen to me...

31:40.266 --> 31:43.002
business is business.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.005
Cane made some mistakes

31:46.538 --> 31:48.207
and he's fucked up a lot

31:48.641 --> 31:52.444
but family always comes first.

31:53.279 --> 31:54.346
Always.

31:56.148 --> 31:59.652
We are strongest when we're together.

32:02.655 --> 32:03.922
Do you understand?

32:09.194 --> 32:10.262
I understand.

32:11.463 --> 32:12.598
I understand daddy.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.594
I'm happy you finally called,
Nae-Nae.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.330
Don't call me that.

32:44.363 --> 32:45.431
And that wasn't my mom's house

32:45.464 --> 32:47.433
where you turned over
those cans.

32:47.466 --> 32:48.634
<i>I got kids, Dante.</i>

32:50.569 --> 32:53.405
<i>Yes, and a husband, right?</i>

32:53.439 --> 32:55.407
In prison?

32:55.441 --> 32:57.443
What else you think you know?

32:57.476 --> 32:59.178
You run a bar.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.146
Not the life
I remember you wanting.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.684
Look, it's been 24 years,
and not a word.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.454
Why now?

33:14.560 --> 33:16.528
Thank you.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.299
I'm sorry, Monet.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.069
You know, you always had me,

33:24.103 --> 33:27.773
but when I nearly had you,
I-I got roped up.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.576
Wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.578
Now I'm finally the man
you said I could be,

33:32.611 --> 33:35.714
and I guess I couldn't
come back until then.

33:38.717 --> 33:42.020
Shit, I can't believe
you bought the place out.

33:42.054 --> 33:44.623
That import-export business
must be good, huh?

33:44.656 --> 33:47.126
I see you did your research.

33:47.159 --> 33:51.063
You did yours, finding me
under my married name and shit.

33:51.096 --> 33:54.099
I had to, Mrs. Tejada.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.268
Nae-Nae Stewart
wasn't bringing up anything.

33:56.301 --> 33:58.070
That's because she's gone.

33:58.103 --> 34:00.539
- Look, I gotta get outta here.
- Monet.

34:00.572 --> 34:05.210
Look, I get it.
Your life is different now.

34:09.314 --> 34:12.317
You know, I would really love
to take you somewhere.

34:12.351 --> 34:13.619
I don't know
if that's a good idea.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.154
Why?

34:15.187 --> 34:16.488
Old friends
can't go places together?

34:16.522 --> 34:18.490
I don't know
that we're old friends.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.492
Okay.

34:20.526 --> 34:21.760
Then what are we?

34:24.396 --> 34:26.064
You really knew
I would call, huh?

34:29.668 --> 34:31.637
I hoped that you would.

34:35.674 --> 34:38.811
I can't tell you which,
but a major sports outlet

34:38.844 --> 34:41.780
is gonna pay me
stupid money for this shit.

34:41.814 --> 34:43.482
<i>Don't worry about it.
Just get your shit together.</i>

34:43.515 --> 34:45.217
<i>-Come on.</i>
- You can't sell that.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.585
How do we know if Zeke's okay?

34:46.618 --> 34:48.287
Girl, calm down.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.289
Zeke ain't no fucking
Aaron Hernandez.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.224
He ain't do shit.
He'll be fine.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.593
But I'm more curious as to why
Sierra and her goodies

34:54.626 --> 34:56.195
were in Zeke's room
in the first place.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.429
Uh, yeah, since when did you

34:57.463 --> 34:59.097
start sleeping
with people for stories?

34:59.131 --> 35:01.767
Okay, since when did you
start slut-shaming, Lauren?

35:01.800 --> 35:03.502
I'm not, I'm just saying,
I think it's foul

35:03.535 --> 35:05.137
that you let him hit
for a story.

35:05.170 --> 35:06.839
Lauren, calm down.

35:06.872 --> 35:09.641
Your feelings about Tariq
clearly got you on edge, girl.

35:09.675 --> 35:12.411
- I'm not tripping off Tariq.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.112
I gotta get over that.

35:14.146 --> 35:15.814
<i>I just wish he would tell me
how he really feels.</i>

35:15.848 --> 35:17.115
See, that's why I don't fuck

35:17.149 --> 35:18.684
with none of these
undergrad niggas.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.252
They don't know a real woman
when they see one.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.453
Mm-hmm.

35:21.487 --> 35:22.554
But you know what you need?

35:22.588 --> 35:24.790
Up here worrying about
that nigga's bag,

35:24.823 --> 35:26.792
<i>but you need to get up
into this.</i>

35:26.825 --> 35:29.127
Oh!

35:29.161 --> 35:30.596
Is that weed?

35:30.629 --> 35:33.465
- Yes, bitch. We smoking Lizzos.
<i>Okay, no.</i>

35:33.499 --> 35:35.234
<i>I have internship interviews,</i>

35:35.267 --> 35:37.269
and if they drug test me...
it's a wrap.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.905
When you ready to forget
that nigga's name,

35:40.138 --> 35:42.574
don't worry, I got you.

35:42.608 --> 35:44.710
<i>Hmm.</i>

35:44.743 --> 35:47.145
That bitch is gonna need
more than that to relax.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.414
Oh, yeah. A whole lot.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.353
Look, um, I know Monet,

35:54.386 --> 35:56.655
she had fronted me some money
with Cane, and...

35:56.688 --> 35:57.923
I don't got that shit yet.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.791
I ain't hit you about that.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.226
I wanna talk to you
about the lawyer

36:01.260 --> 36:02.394
that got your mom off.

36:02.427 --> 36:03.862
- Davis?
Yeah.

36:03.896 --> 36:05.430
I tried to get
an appointment with him,

36:05.464 --> 36:08.333
but the lady at the desk said
I need a referral.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.536
Look, 'Riq, I held you down
with Monet

36:10.569 --> 36:11.670
over that sugared coke.

36:11.703 --> 36:12.838
You owe me.

36:15.574 --> 36:18.744
'Riq, I need you.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.280
I got you, D. I got you.

36:21.313 --> 36:22.948
Okay.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.950
Don't worry about it.

36:28.253 --> 36:29.755
Yo. You find her?

36:29.788 --> 36:32.324
I'm a man of my word,
young brother.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.193
<i>A'ight, so when can I see her?</i>

36:35.227 --> 36:36.795
<i>Six p.m. sharp today.</i>

36:36.828 --> 36:38.764
- Hey.
- What's up?

36:38.797 --> 36:39.865
That's in a hour.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.366
Better hop to it.

36:43.602 --> 36:44.970
<i>Can you text me the address?</i>

36:46.405 --> 36:49.274
I gotta go. Text me.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.809
Yo, you dead ass, Tariq?

36:50.842 --> 36:53.378
I bring you up here,
and then you bring her?

36:53.412 --> 36:55.948
Look, Lauren, it's not
like that, a'ight? I--

36:55.981 --> 36:57.549
It's so much shit
going on right now.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.418
Everything's so complicated
'cause of my mom, and--

36:59.451 --> 37:01.753
Okay, then tell me,
what is it like, Tariq?

37:01.787 --> 37:03.989
What's it even like
between me and you?

37:04.222 --> 37:05.657
I'm just asking you
to be up front with me.

37:07.659 --> 37:10.329
You know what? Never mind.

37:11.363 --> 37:12.998

Hi.

She's pretty.

38:39.551 --> 38:40.852
<i>She is, right?</i>

38:40.886 --> 38:42.421
Thank you. So are you.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.367
I think you're
beating me at this.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.935
- I kinda am.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.537
What? I am.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.906
An honest woman.
I respect that.

39:00.939 --> 39:02.674
Are you Tariq's girlfriend?

39:02.708 --> 39:04.042
<i>Um--</i>
- Whoa, Yas.

39:04.076 --> 39:07.012

39:07.045 --> 39:08.380
I'm the one
that's supposed to be

39:08.413 --> 39:09.715
asking you the questions.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.650
<i>A'ight? So talk to me.</i>

39:11.683 --> 39:13.351
You hanging in there, right?

39:13.385 --> 39:15.554
You'll be home soon. Okay?

39:15.587 --> 39:17.789
I don't wanna go home,
not with Big Mama.

39:17.823 --> 39:18.990
<i>When you come back,</i>

39:19.024 --> 39:20.058

39:21.460 --> 39:22.861
You really mean that, 'Riq?

39:22.894 --> 39:24.062
Yeah, of course I do.

39:24.096 --> 39:25.497
I can be with you all the time,

39:25.530 --> 39:26.565
and Lauren can visit.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.033
- I hope so.
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:28.066 --> 39:29.067
And so can Mom.

39:29.101 --> 39:32.938
Um, I don't know
about Ma yet, Yas.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.072
You know, I'm still
working on that.

39:34.106 --> 39:35.907
It might take a little minute.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.476
But look, I got this

39:37.509 --> 39:39.077
so I'm with you
anywhere and everywhere you go.

39:39.111 --> 39:40.645
Thank you.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.818
Excuse me.

39:51.623 --> 39:52.891
Um, where's your bathroom?

39:52.924 --> 39:54.593
Down the hall to the left.

39:54.626 --> 39:58.597
<i>Okay, but is that,
like, your left or my left?</i>

40:04.703 --> 40:08.039

40:09.441 --> 40:12.444
Go like this, this, and boom.

40:12.477 --> 40:14.045

sees this phone.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.881
- Okay.
- Nobody, okay?

40:18.150 --> 40:19.718
Okay, time's up.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.987
I-I could have sworn
we just got here.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.955

40:37.435 --> 40:39.971
Thank you

40:40.005 --> 40:43.475
Watching you and your sister,
I get it now.

40:43.508 --> 40:46.044
- You're all she has.
- Yeah.

40:46.077 --> 40:48.013
You know,
I wanted to show you that.

40:48.046 --> 40:49.781
<i>I just didn't want you

40:49.815 --> 40:51.683

Oh, shit. I gotta go.

41:57.215 --> 41:58.617
What is it? Can I help?

41:58.650 --> 42:00.518
Nah, I gotta do this alone.

42:19.704 --> 42:21.840
I told you she would
text you back.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.975
- What, you a psychic now?

42:26.978 --> 42:28.146
- Mr. Cross.
<i>Excuse me. Rude.</i>

You can shut the fuck up.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.549

- What the fuck?

42:31.583 --> 42:32.817
What-what's wrong?

42:32.851 --> 42:35.086
Fucking cops
just grabbed up Zeke.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.121
I know.

42:37.088 --> 42:38.690
What do you mean you know?

42:38.723 --> 42:40.825
Sierra was there.
She was the one who shot it.

42:40.859 --> 42:42.594
She-she showed me.

42:42.627 --> 42:43.962
Fuck, are you serious, Lauren?

42:43.995 --> 42:45.664
Look, with everything going on
with your sister today,

42:45.697 --> 42:47.565
- I just forgot.
- Oh, man.

42:47.599 --> 42:49.868
Lauren, if anything happens
to Zeke, I'm outta here.

42:49.901 --> 42:52.337
A'ight, half of my acceptance
was based on me helping him.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.005
Wait, what?

42:54.039 --> 42:55.640
This doesn't-that doesn't
make any sense.

42:55.674 --> 42:56.775
There's a lot of shit
that's not gonna make sense

42:56.808 --> 42:58.276
to you right now, Lauren.

42:58.310 --> 43:00.045
Fuck.

43:00.078 --> 43:01.813
Tariq, I'm so sorry.

43:03.214 --> 43:05.717
Is there anything I can do?

43:05.750 --> 43:08.153
No, it-it's fine.
I, um--I'm sorry.

43:08.186 --> 43:09.287
It's not your fault.

43:09.321 --> 43:10.922
I gotta go handle this, okay?

43:10.956 --> 43:12.958
I'll hit you later.

43:18.964 --> 43:21.833
Yo, Davis, I need you to handle
something for me ASAP.

43:24.836 --> 43:26.972
She ain't comin'.
I need to call somebody else.

43:28.306 --> 43:29.741
Zeke, you need to trust me,

43:29.774 --> 43:31.076
'cause there's no one else
who can help you.

43:31.109 --> 43:33.044
Wait.

43:33.078 --> 43:35.113
Check out my PBA card.

43:35.146 --> 43:36.881
It's in my wallet.

43:38.783 --> 43:41.920
Of course you have a PBA card.

43:48.026 --> 43:48.994
He'll help me.

43:49.027 --> 43:50.762
Detective Ramirez?

43:53.665 --> 43:55.133
Where's Zeke Cross?

43:55.166 --> 43:56.935
I'm his guardian.
You can't hold him.

43:56.968 --> 43:58.903
- You need to calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

43:58.937 --> 44:00.105
And don't you
fucking touch me either.

44:00.138 --> 44:01.339
Now, where is my nephew?

44:01.373 --> 44:03.074
Where'd you get this card?

44:04.275 --> 44:06.711
I don't remember.
Call him. Ask him.

44:06.745 --> 44:08.913
When was the last time
you saw Detective Ramirez?

44:08.947 --> 44:10.382
He's a fan.
I met him at a game.

44:10.415 --> 44:11.750
He told me to show the card

44:11.783 --> 44:13.385
in case I-in case
I got jammed up.

44:13.418 --> 44:16.287
- Zeke!
- Hold on, ma'am.

44:16.321 --> 44:18.723
<i>-Ma'am!</i>
- Zeke.

44:18.757 --> 44:19.991
Ramirez gave you
this card himself?

44:20.025 --> 44:21.026
- Zeke!
- I just--I don't--

44:21.059 --> 44:23.128
- Huh?
- Uh-uh, get up, Zeke.

44:23.161 --> 44:24.229
Who the fuck are you?

44:24.262 --> 44:25.430
You need to watch
how you talk to me.

44:25.663 --> 44:26.965
Now, are you charging him?

44:26.998 --> 44:28.867
I'm asking him some questions.
He's here voluntarily.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.736
Well, now he's
voluntarily leaving, asshole.

44:31.770 --> 44:33.371
Give me a fuckin' break.

44:33.405 --> 44:35.140
Where's my client
Ezekiel Cross?

44:35.173 --> 44:36.708
I wanna see him now.

44:36.741 --> 44:39.377
Your client?
Who the fuck hired you?

44:39.411 --> 44:42.380
Ah, I'm Davis McLean,
criminal defense attorney.

44:42.414 --> 44:43.715
- A mutual friend.
Yeah, yeah.

44:43.748 --> 44:44.783
I know who you are.

44:44.816 --> 44:45.984
And we don't need
a criminal lawyer.

44:46.017 --> 44:48.219
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Listen.

44:48.253 --> 44:50.955
I-I just ran a gauntlet
of reporters outside

44:50.989 --> 44:52.157
to get in here.

44:52.190 --> 44:53.792
It's a zoo.

44:53.825 --> 44:56.094
Now, you go out there,

44:56.127 --> 44:57.796
they'll eat this kid alive.

44:59.064 --> 45:01.299
Yeah, use the back door.

45:01.332 --> 45:03.768
I'll handle the press for you.

45:03.802 --> 45:04.969
<i>Hold up. Just let me ask him--</i>

45:05.003 --> 45:06.738
You wanna lose
your motherfucking badge?

45:06.771 --> 45:08.306
Get the fuck outta my face.

45:10.442 --> 45:13.445
Ezekiel Cross
voluntarily presented himself

45:13.478 --> 45:17.082
to detectives to assist
in an investigation.

45:17.115 --> 45:18.783
He was never a suspect,

45:18.817 --> 45:21.920
just a good citizen
looking to help the police.

45:21.953 --> 45:23.855
Detectives will tell you
he was not charged

45:23.888 --> 45:25.890
with anything and in fact,

45:25.924 --> 45:28.259
they were more than happy
to have this help.

45:38.069 --> 45:39.437
<i>Look at me. Did they hurt you?</i>

45:39.471 --> 45:40.505
<i>What happened?</i>

45:41.973 --> 45:43.408
Professor Reynolds.

45:44.976 --> 45:46.244
They think me and Carrie

45:46.277 --> 45:48.780
had something to do
with his murder.

45:48.813 --> 45:52.183
The fucking professor bitch
I told you to stop fucking.

45:52.217 --> 45:53.384
Zeke, you need to end
this shit now.

45:53.418 --> 45:54.486
I did.

45:54.519 --> 45:56.154
Obviously not soon enough.

45:56.187 --> 45:58.790
Why they trying to pin
this shit you?

45:58.823 --> 46:00.091
What are you not telling me?

46:02.260 --> 46:04.529
She was with Jabari.

46:04.762 --> 46:07.332
So your girlfriend was fucking
the dead professor nigga.

46:07.365 --> 46:09.100
Zeke, you're on your way
to the NBA,

46:09.134 --> 46:10.101
and you out here
getting caught up

46:10.135 --> 46:11.836
in some community pussy?

46:11.870 --> 46:12.837
Come on, man.

46:12.871 --> 46:14.239
Look, I-I didn't say anything.

46:14.272 --> 46:17.809
I-I didn't know what to do.

46:17.842 --> 46:19.344
I called you.
You didn't answer.

46:20.778 --> 46:22.947
And then I gave them
Ramirez's PBA card.

46:22.981 --> 46:25.016
Wait, you did what?

46:25.049 --> 46:26.784
Fuck!

46:26.818 --> 46:28.987
You fucking gave them
Ramirez's PBA card?

46:29.020 --> 46:31.322
That's what you told me to do.

46:31.356 --> 46:33.191
Isn't it?

46:33.224 --> 46:35.460
Monet.

46:35.493 --> 46:37.929
Is there something wrong
with Ramirez?

46:41.099 --> 46:42.834

46:42.867 --> 46:45.270
You always talk about having
my best interest at heart,

46:45.303 --> 46:47.405
but don't tell me shit
to protect myself!

46:47.438 --> 46:51.109
This is my life, my career.

46:52.510 --> 46:55.346
What the fuck did you
just get me into?

46:55.380 --> 46:56.548
Damn, I'm sorry, Zeke.

46:56.581 --> 46:58.316
I should have took that card
away from you.

46:58.349 --> 47:00.151
Look, I'ma make this right.

pickups of my own to make.

53:47.658 --> 53:49.860
- You what I mean?
- Yeah. No, I can see that.

53:49.894 --> 53:51.796
Bro, I didn't think you were
gonna show, to be honest.

53:51.829 --> 53:53.631
Nah, man, listen,
we business partners.

53:53.664 --> 53:55.566
You trust me,
I trust you, remember?

53:55.600 --> 53:56.901
Facts.

53:56.934 --> 53:58.569
Hand me that bag.

54:04.342 --> 54:06.744
Oh! Fuck!

54:06.777 --> 54:08.846
Bro, this is way more
than we needed.

54:08.879 --> 54:10.815
Man, you are right,
the streets are where it's at.

54:10.848 --> 54:13.417
You had me for real.

54:13.451 --> 54:14.652
Nah, I gotta link Tariq, but--

54:14.685 --> 54:15.953
Aw, "I gotta link Tariq"?

54:15.987 --> 54:17.555
You sure
you wanna get your boy?

54:17.588 --> 54:18.889
Come on, you don't wanna join?

54:18.923 --> 54:20.725
Come on, let's have some fun.

54:20.758 --> 54:24.328
<i>Come on, baby. Let's have fun.</i>

54:24.362 --> 54:26.731
Nope, I gotta go. I gotta go.

54:26.764 --> 54:28.032
I gotta go.

54:28.265 --> 54:29.600
Fuckin' Tariq.

54:33.504 --> 54:36.741
Why don't you buy yourself

54:36.774 --> 54:38.509
My name's Brayden.

54:38.542 --> 54:40.778
And I think I'm in love

54:42.046 --> 54:43.681
"My name's Brayden.
I'm in love."

54:44.815 --> 54:46.651
- Bye, Brayden.
- God damn it, Tariq!

54:46.684 --> 54:48.552
I know I'm gonna regret asking,

54:48.586 --> 54:51.055
but what's, uh--
what's going on, Cooper?

54:51.288 --> 54:53.758
There is this case
I turned down,

54:53.791 --> 54:55.660
but it's the high-profile,

54:55.693 --> 54:58.829
big-fish shit
that Davis likes, so...

54:58.863 --> 55:00.631
What was it?

55:00.665 --> 55:03.601
Lorenzo Tejada, appeal.

55:05.036 --> 55:07.471
I remember him.

55:07.505 --> 55:09.306
Manslaughter?

55:09.340 --> 55:11.375
Uh, and multiple drug offenses.

55:11.409 --> 55:12.610
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

55:13.544 --> 55:16.814
Well, if Walter Griffith
was good at one thing,

55:16.847 --> 55:19.750
<i>it was prosecuting
those types of cases.</i>

55:19.784 --> 55:22.820
Wait. Wait, that was
Walt Griffith's case?

55:24.321 --> 55:27.358
I heard he got fired
for-for, uh,

55:27.391 --> 55:28.693
tampering with evidence
or stealing drugs from--

55:28.726 --> 55:30.795
From the evidence locker, yeah.

55:30.828 --> 55:32.730
<i>But he did a fantastic job
of putting monsters</i>

55:32.763 --> 55:33.998
like that Tejada guy away.

55:41.939 --> 55:43.741
<i>Cooper, you coming?</i>

55:43.774 --> 55:46.744
Yeah, yeah. One sec.

55:55.920 --> 55:57.822
My bad, bro.
Parking was a bitch.

55:57.855 --> 55:59.724
Listen, man, you can't be late
to shit like this.

55:59.757 --> 56:01.959
A'ight, I gotta know
you serious.

56:01.992 --> 56:03.127
You got the money from
the dead drop, though, right?

56:03.360 --> 56:04.795
- Is it was enough?
- Yeah.

56:06.731 --> 56:09.567
I'm in this, Tariq. 30K.

56:09.600 --> 56:11.836
Know I got you bro.
You don't gotta worry.

56:11.869 --> 56:13.871
Speaking of business,
I know you said no

56:13.904 --> 56:15.473
about diversifying
to the streets, but I--

56:15.506 --> 56:16.507
How many fucking times
I gotta tell you

56:16.540 --> 56:17.708
we're not fucking with Cane, B?

56:17.742 --> 56:18.909
- I know.
- Listen, we pick up

56:18.943 --> 56:20.377
the product from him
like we've been doing

56:20.411 --> 56:21.746
and continue business
like usual.

56:21.779 --> 56:22.980
Be fine.

56:24.682 --> 56:27.618
Gentlemen, I'm interrupting
my massage for this.

56:27.651 --> 56:29.086
See you found someone
you can trust.

56:29.120 --> 56:31.088
Yes, I did.

56:31.122 --> 56:33.991
All Mr. Weston
has to do is sign here

56:34.024 --> 56:37.394
and you'll have a president
and a legitimate paycheck,

56:37.428 --> 56:39.864
provided you have my cut,
of course.

56:39.897 --> 56:41.098
I have your cut.
