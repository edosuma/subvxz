01:53.614 --> 01:54.824
-[Paul] Sorry it's--

01:53.614 --> 01:54.824
-[Sam] You have to call back.

01:54.949 --> 01:56.742
[Paul] Enough already,

01:54.949 --> 01:56.742
Okay?

01:56.868 --> 01:58.953
I'm not taking advice

01:56.868 --> 01:58.953
from some guy after he--

01:59.078 --> 02:00.746
He's a friend and he's right.

02:01.246 --> 02:04.083
You can't just walk away from

02:01.246 --> 02:04.083
me. We're not done talking

02:01.246 --> 02:04.083
about this.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.335
Jane has been waiting

02:04.208 --> 02:06.335
half an hour. We'll talk later.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.962
Let her wait.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.962
This is a lot more important.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.463
And besides you can't

02:08.086 --> 02:09.463
drive, you're drunk.

02:09.588 --> 02:10.756
Do you want to drive?

02:11.465 --> 02:14.259
My one beer versus your half

02:11.465 --> 02:14.259
bottle of wine. Who should go?

02:15.094 --> 02:16.554
That's what I thought.

02:16.679 --> 02:18.973
Why don't you go back in

02:16.679 --> 02:18.973
and cool off.

02:19.682 --> 02:20.725
[tense music]

02:44.498 --> 02:47.334
[Karli] One hour late and

02:44.498 --> 02:47.334
counting. Wanna go back in

02:44.498 --> 02:47.334
and have a drink?

02:47.459 --> 02:49.461
Alright, I think they know

02:47.459 --> 02:49.461
how old we are in there.

02:50.046 --> 02:53.549
Well, I'll buy

02:50.046 --> 02:53.549
for the both of us.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.635
You are a terrible influence.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.805
-But it does look pretty good.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.805
-Yeah, I have

02:57.386 --> 02:59.805
the coolest cousin.

03:00.305 --> 03:03.517
-He'll probably hook you up.

03:00.305 --> 03:03.517
-I'll keep that in mind.

03:04.602 --> 03:06.395
Hey, sweethearts,

03:04.602 --> 03:06.395
sorry I'm late.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.563
Uh-hu.

03:08.773 --> 03:11.400
-Traffic?

03:08.773 --> 03:11.400
-Not tonight, Karli.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.070
-Good night.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.070
-[Paul] Good night.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.489
-Hi, dad.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.489
-Hi.

03:26.124 --> 03:27.875
Our set was

03:26.124 --> 03:27.875
pretty killer but

03:28.000 --> 03:30.252
the guys after us were so good.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.213
There was a guy with a cello...

03:30.377 --> 03:33.213
Dad?

03:33.672 --> 03:36.008
-Yeah, what's that?

03:33.672 --> 03:36.008
-Was everything OK?

03:37.342 --> 03:39.720
Just your mother, you know.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.720
She keeps telling me...

03:41.221 --> 03:44.934
Listen, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.934
I really shouldn't bring you

03:41.221 --> 03:44.934
into this.

03:47.853 --> 03:48.771
[phone rings]

03:49.396 --> 03:51.398
Damn it.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.398
I've got to take this, sorry.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.526
Jim, what's up?

03:55.611 --> 03:57.404
No, listen,

03:55.611 --> 03:57.404
I'm telling you

03:57.529 --> 03:58.739
the figures are there.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.742
I don't know what you are

04:00.407 --> 04:01.742
looking at

04:01.867 --> 04:03.285
but I proofed everything

04:01.867 --> 04:03.285
before I left.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.453
Dad?

04:06.205 --> 04:09.000
-Just let me get this, the

04:06.205 --> 04:09.000
minute I get home I will look--

04:06.205 --> 04:09.000
-Dad, look!

04:09.125 --> 04:10.626
[tires screeching and car crashes]

04:32.857 --> 04:33.649
[girl] Jane!

04:33.774 --> 04:35.317
Oh, hi, Till.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.694
Are you ready

04:35.442 --> 04:36.694
to get out of here?

04:37.695 --> 04:41.032
-Mom, I can get around

04:37.695 --> 04:41.032
on these just fine.

04:37.695 --> 04:41.032
-I know, but...

04:41.991 --> 04:45.828
You can let me help you.

04:41.991 --> 04:45.828
Besides, I think

04:41.991 --> 04:45.828
it's hospital policy.

04:46.996 --> 04:48.080
-Come on.

04:46.996 --> 04:48.080
-Okay.

04:50.208 --> 04:52.084
-Thanks.

04:50.208 --> 04:52.084
-There you go.

04:52.210 --> 04:55.546
-Can I hug you?

04:52.210 --> 04:55.546
-Of course you can.

04:52.210 --> 04:55.546
Come here.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.715
Your bugs are my bugs,

04:55.921 --> 04:57.715
remember?

04:59.258 --> 05:01.593
-Hold these.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.593
-Yeah.

05:01.886 --> 05:03.470
-Can I push you.

05:01.886 --> 05:03.470
-Yeah.

05:03.595 --> 05:04.638
[Sam] Just be careful.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.933
[Jane] Great, I'm

05:05.639 --> 05:07.933
an invalid at 17.

05:08.059 --> 05:10.310
Your doctor said your infection

05:08.059 --> 05:10.310
is under control.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.022
You need to make sure you take

05:10.435 --> 05:13.022
your full course of antibiotics.

05:13.147 --> 05:14.606
I know, I was there.

05:15.066 --> 05:17.860
Also the painkillers you are on

05:15.066 --> 05:17.860
are a class two narcotic.

05:18.277 --> 05:19.737
We'll have to monitor

05:18.277 --> 05:19.737
your intake.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.073
-Really, Mom?

05:20.112 --> 05:22.073
-What?

05:22.364 --> 05:24.992
Apparently they cause

05:22.364 --> 05:24.992
constipation. We don't want

05:22.364 --> 05:24.992
that, do we?

05:25.117 --> 05:26.160
[sighs]

05:27.912 --> 05:29.997
-Are you OK?

05:27.912 --> 05:29.997
-Yeah, I can... I'm fine.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.170
I spoke to the superintendent

05:33.792 --> 05:36.170
and he said that

05:36.295 --> 05:39.924
as long as you pass your exams,

05:36.295 --> 05:39.924
it is not going to affect your

05:36.295 --> 05:39.924
college acceptance.

05:40.049 --> 05:41.425
Awesome, thanks.

05:47.181 --> 05:50.768
Also, I was thinking if you

05:47.181 --> 05:50.768
want it I could move your bed

05:47.181 --> 05:50.768
downstairs

05:50.893 --> 05:52.186
to make it easier for you.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.771
I can do stairs, mom.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.983
Look, I'm sorry. I'm just...

05:59.860 --> 06:03.197
Thank you.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.197
Can we just get going, please?

06:04.740 --> 06:05.783
Of course.

06:24.093 --> 06:25.303
-[man] Hey.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.096
-Did you get it fixed?

06:25.594 --> 06:27.096
-Good to go.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.014
-Thanks.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.014
-Hi, Brian.

06:29.140 --> 06:30.308
Hey, Till!

06:31.058 --> 06:33.393
-[Brian] Listen, I have to jet.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.393
-Will I see you soon?

06:33.518 --> 06:34.561
[Brian] See ya.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.941
-Who is Brian?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.941
-He's a friend.

06:39.441 --> 06:43.779
-A friend?

06:39.441 --> 06:43.779
-Yeah. I have friends.

06:45.781 --> 06:48.909
-[Jane] So you just decided to

06:45.781 --> 06:48.909
kick Dad out of the house?

06:45.781 --> 06:48.909
-[Sam] He left.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.664
And now you are dating.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.664
It's been two months, right?

06:53.789 --> 06:56.083
He's been a really big help

06:53.789 --> 06:56.083
since you've been gone.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.377
And you're only deciding

06:56.208 --> 06:58.377
to tell me this now?

06:58.502 --> 07:01.839
-I did not want to confuse you.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.839
-Confuse me, really?

07:02.422 --> 07:05.134
You don't know how hard it's

07:02.422 --> 07:05.134
been taking care of you

07:05.259 --> 07:07.761
and trying to keep life normal

07:05.259 --> 07:07.761
for your little sister.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.097
Mom, I'm the one who

07:07.886 --> 07:10.097
almost died, remember?

07:10.222 --> 07:13.809
I know that, sweetheart, but

07:10.222 --> 07:13.809
you are not the only one who's

07:10.222 --> 07:13.809
been affected.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.103
[exhales deeply]

07:20.024 --> 07:21.066

Oh, sweetheart.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.527
I know, this is hard,

08:02.149 --> 08:05.527
but I think in time--

08:05.652 --> 08:08.572
Can you get my prescriptions?

08:05.652 --> 08:08.572
My leg hurts really bad.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.116
It does? Yeah, of course I can.

08:12.576 --> 08:14.953
-But we're gonna talk

08:12.576 --> 08:14.953
when I come back.

08:12.576 --> 08:14.953
-Sure.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.539
I love you.

08:27.049 --> 08:27.966
[typing text on cell]

08:29.134 --> 08:31.178
-[Sam] How is the Portobello?

08:29.134 --> 08:31.178
-[Jane] It's actually

08:29.134 --> 08:31.178
pretty good.

08:31.553 --> 08:36.015
-The vegetarian options of the

08:31.553 --> 08:36.015
hospital are lacking.

08:31.553 --> 08:36.015
-You mean it sucked?

08:45.276 --> 08:46.318
All of us?

08:48.612 --> 08:50.614
Look, your father and I

08:48.612 --> 08:50.614
we spoke and we decided

08:50.739 --> 08:52.741
that it would be best if he

08:50.739 --> 08:52.741
wasn't here when you got home.

08:52.866 --> 08:58.580
Just to avoid making things...

08:52.866 --> 08:58.580
difficult for everyone.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.208
Mission accomplished.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.384
-Till, you are about done.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.384
-Uh-huh.

-Remember that game you were

09:10.759 --> 09:13.095
telling me about?

09:10.759 --> 09:13.095
-Uh-huh.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.013
Do you want to go inside

09:13.553 --> 09:15.013
and set it up?

09:23.772 --> 09:29.111
-Why isn't Dad here?

09:23.772 --> 09:29.111
-Honestly, he still cannot

09:23.772 --> 09:29.111
deal with the accident.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.489
He didn't wanna make things

09:29.903 --> 09:31.489
harder for you.

09:31.613 --> 09:34.408
He's going through a very hard

09:31.613 --> 09:34.408
time right now.

09:34.825 --> 09:38.787
That's bull. You didn't want

09:34.825 --> 09:38.787
him here and you're using me

09:34.825 --> 09:38.787
as an excuse.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.372
Is that what he told you?

09:42.249 --> 09:43.292
No.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.046
Has he been returning

09:46.378 --> 09:48.046
your phone calls?

09:50.924 --> 09:51.842
Till is waiting for me.

09:55.887 --> 09:59.057
Honey, I'm your mother.

09:55.887 --> 09:59.057

[soft music]

10:24.041 --> 10:26.210
-Good morning.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.210
-Morning.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.920
I booked you a training session

10:26.335 --> 10:28.920
at the gym this afternoon

10:26.335 --> 10:28.920
with the trainer.

10:29.046 --> 10:32.299
So that we can strengthen your

10:29.046 --> 10:32.299
leg like the physiotherapist

10:29.046 --> 10:32.299
told us to.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.593
I thought we could do those

10:32.424 --> 10:34.593
exercises at home.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.762
I know, but why not get a

10:34.718 --> 10:37.762
professional's help if we can?

10:46.104 --> 10:48.690
-Hi.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.690
-Hey.

10:49.608 --> 10:52.903
We have the whole day to

10:49.608 --> 10:52.903
ourselves, what do you wanna do?

10:53.695 --> 10:55.573
I probably should be studying.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.824
Come on, you have been locked in

10:56.156 --> 10:57.824
your room for months.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.618
You should get out,

10:57.949 --> 10:59.618
you're free.

11:00.619 --> 11:05.040
-I guess

11:00.619 --> 11:05.040
I could use some new clothes.

11:00.619 --> 11:05.040
-Aha, now we're talking.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.213
-Mom, I can't pull off hats.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.213
-Of course you can.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.881
You just have to know

11:11.338 --> 11:12.881
which one to buy.

11:14.258 --> 11:15.300
Oh, my God!

11:17.094 --> 11:19.221
-What?

11:17.094 --> 11:19.221
-I had a hat just

11:17.094 --> 11:19.221
like this in college

11:19.346 --> 11:21.390
and it went with

11:19.346 --> 11:21.390
absolutely everything.

11:22.140 --> 11:25.477
The advantage of getting older

11:22.140 --> 11:25.477
is that all your styles

11:22.140 --> 11:25.477
come back.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.147
What do you think?

11:31.108 --> 11:35.112
-Uh...

11:31.108 --> 11:35.112
-Really? I have to work

11:31.108 --> 11:35.112
on a new style.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.912
-Are you and Dad talking?

11:41.159 --> 11:43.912
-Yeah, most days.

11:44.037 --> 11:48.292
-What are you guys gonna try,

11:44.037 --> 11:48.292
like, therapy or...?

11:44.037 --> 11:48.292
-Uh...

11:50.168 --> 11:52.254
You have to know this has

11:50.168 --> 11:52.254
been coming for some time.

11:52.671 --> 11:55.382
And then with the added stress

11:52.671 --> 11:55.382
of the accident we...

11:55.507 --> 11:57.551
Mom things get put back together

11:55.507 --> 11:57.551
all the time.

11:57.676 --> 12:00.845
Look, all that you need to

11:57.676 --> 12:00.845
understand is

11:57.676 --> 12:00.845
how much we love you

12:01.555 --> 12:04.600
and that all we want is

12:01.555 --> 12:04.600
for you to get better.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.521
How about this?

12:11.607 --> 12:13.733
-Maybe...

12:11.607 --> 12:13.733
-Yeah.

12:15.902 --> 12:19.406
-Is that new?

12:15.902 --> 12:19.406
-Yeah, it was a gift.

12:19.948 --> 12:20.949
From Dad?

12:24.286 --> 12:25.412
Do you want to try this on?

12:27.456 --> 12:28.499
[sighs]

12:32.169 --> 12:33.211
Thanks.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.849
[woman] Yeah, you've got it.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.607
-[Sam] This way.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.607
-Welcome, welcome, ladies.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.860
What can I possibly do

12:54.399 --> 12:56.860
to improve your perfection?

12:57.235 --> 13:02.407
Well, sir, my daughter has an

12:57.235 --> 13:02.407
appointment for a training

12:57.235 --> 13:02.407
session,

13:02.533 --> 13:05.410
for some rehab on her knee.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.410
She was in head surgery.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.371
So, you're Brian?

13:09.707 --> 13:14.336
-Yes. I am Brian McGavin.

13:09.707 --> 13:14.336
You must be Jane.

13:09.707 --> 13:14.336
-Yeah.

13:14.836 --> 13:17.214
I thought it would be a

13:14.836 --> 13:17.214
nice way to introduce you.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.675
He helped me to

13:17.839 --> 13:19.675
get into great shape.

13:19.799 --> 13:23.261
-Right.

13:19.799 --> 13:23.261
-Yeah, everybody loves a good

13:19.799 --> 13:23.261
ambush, right?

13:24.429 --> 13:28.600
It's funny. Since you are here,

13:24.429 --> 13:28.600
why don't you let me help you

13:24.429 --> 13:28.600
rehab your knee?

13:29.184 --> 13:33.689
-It sounds good. It's just that

13:29.184 --> 13:33.689
I need to return a text.

13:29.184 --> 13:33.689
-No worries.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.442
Alright.

13:41.279 --> 13:42.322
That's good?

13:48.995 --> 13:49.996
[energetic music]

13:53.500 --> 13:55.586
-[Brian] You did great.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.586
-Thanks.

13:56.712 --> 13:58.714
Oh, please, Sam

13:56.712 --> 13:58.714
don't insult me like that.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.716
What? No, I don't want you to...

14:00.840 --> 14:04.720
I want to. Presto,

14:00.840 --> 14:04.720
it's like you were never here.

14:06.012 --> 14:09.057
Is there time again now

14:06.012 --> 14:09.057
though, can I take you to lunch?

14:10.225 --> 14:11.602
We would love that,

14:10.225 --> 14:11.602
wouldn't we?

14:14.605 --> 14:18.525
-I can't see why not.

14:14.605 --> 14:18.525
-Great. I'll get my things

14:14.605 --> 14:18.525
and meet you out front?

14:18.650 --> 14:19.818
-Sure.

14:18.650 --> 14:19.818
-Cool.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.031
Thanks for being so good

14:23.321 --> 14:25.031
about this.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.325
Yeah, well, I believe in

14:25.156 --> 14:27.325
putting in the work.

14:30.036 --> 14:34.332
-Karli!

14:30.036 --> 14:34.332
-Hi, I was just walking past

14:30.036 --> 14:34.332
when I saw you guys.

14:35.333 --> 14:40.046
-I should have called you but...

14:35.333 --> 14:40.046
things, you know?

14:35.333 --> 14:40.046
-Yeah, things are the worst.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.881
What are you doing

14:40.547 --> 14:41.881
right this second?

14:42.549 --> 14:45.343
-Oh, uh...

14:42.549 --> 14:45.343
-Brian is taking us to lunch.

14:45.844 --> 14:48.430
-And Brian is...?

14:45.844 --> 14:48.430
-That would be me.

14:48.555 --> 14:52.768
-Yep. Karli meet Brian and

14:48.555 --> 14:52.768
vice versa.

14:48.555 --> 14:52.768
-Very nice to meet you.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.563
-Nice to meet you too.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.563
-So, four for lunch?

14:57.314 --> 15:00.609
Actually I was kind of hoping I

14:57.314 --> 15:00.609
could steal Jane away from you.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.694
We haven't seen

15:00.734 --> 15:02.694
each other in weeks.

15:02.986 --> 15:06.531
-Oh, no, because

15:02.986 --> 15:06.531
we really wanted to...

15:02.986 --> 15:06.531
-Sorry, mom.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.868
I'll tell you what. Why don't I

15:08.116 --> 15:09.868
come back later on today,

15:10.619 --> 15:14.331
make my famous risotto for you

15:10.619 --> 15:14.331
and we can get to know

15:10.619 --> 15:14.331
each other then.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.459
That sounds great to me. Mom?

15:19.544 --> 15:24.675
-OK, sure, fine. Just be home

15:19.544 --> 15:24.675
by seven, thank you.

15:19.544 --> 15:24.675
-Double for me please.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.387
-Thank you.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.387
-You're welcome.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.349
-Shall we?

15:31.139 --> 15:32.349
-Yeah.

15:34.267 --> 15:38.188
I don't know why you called for

15:34.267 --> 15:38.188
a rescue. He seems pretty

15:34.267 --> 15:38.188
awesome.

15:45.236 --> 15:49.783
-What were you basing that on?

15:45.236 --> 15:49.783
-I've heard he has a famous

15:45.236 --> 15:49.783
risotto. It's pretty famous.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.243
This isn't a great time

15:50.074 --> 15:52.243
for jokes, Karli.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.746
This is the perfect time for

15:52.369 --> 15:54.746
jokes, OK?

15:54.872 --> 15:59.626
Your mother is cougering

15:54.872 --> 15:59.626
her way into the heart and

15:54.872 --> 15:59.626
pants of a male model.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.461
-What?

15:59.751 --> 16:01.461
-Embrace the absurd.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.923
-Has everyone gone

16:01.586 --> 16:04.923
insane except for me?

16:01.586 --> 16:04.923
-Maybe.

16:05.507 --> 16:09.052
But if we all have gone crazy in

16:05.507 --> 16:09.052
the exact same way,

16:05.507 --> 16:09.052
maybe you're the crazy one.

16:09.720 --> 16:14.265
-It's really reassuring.

16:09.720 --> 16:14.265
Thank you.

16:09.720 --> 16:14.265
-So, where are we headed?

16:26.152 --> 16:29.865
-Jane, you're looking great.

16:26.152 --> 16:29.865
-Yeah, I'm a medical marvel.

16:30.699 --> 16:33.493
-So is my Dad in?

16:30.699 --> 16:33.493
-He's actually out, I'm sorry.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.413
Well, can I wait in his office

16:34.619 --> 16:36.413
until he gets back?

16:36.538 --> 16:37.831
Yeah, that would be fine but

16:37.956 --> 16:39.123
he's got meetings all day

16:39.249 --> 16:40.250
so he probably won't be back.

16:40.876 --> 16:44.128
Oh, OK. Thanks anyways.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.594
Sorry, I forgot, what hotel

16:47.173 --> 16:50.594
is he staying in, again?

16:54.932 --> 16:57.809
-Are you sure

16:54.932 --> 16:57.809
you don't want me to stay?

16:54.932 --> 16:57.809
-I'll be fine.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.520
Thank you for the rescue

16:58.560 --> 17:00.520
and the ride.

17:00.645 --> 17:05.400
-No problem. Call if you need

17:00.645 --> 17:05.400
anything, OK?

17:00.645 --> 17:05.400
-Will do.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.156
Hi there.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.156
How can I help you?

17:19.873 --> 17:20.915
[instrumental music]

17:33.052 --> 17:36.932
Jane. What are you doing here?

17:39.977 --> 17:42.604
-Hey.

17:39.977 --> 17:42.604
-Hey, Dad.

17:46.608 --> 17:51.822
Listen. I know I should have

17:46.608 --> 17:51.822
called and come by more and...

17:51.947 --> 17:53.865
Or answered your phone.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.704
I'm sorry about that.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.704
I don't have a good excuse.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.626
There's been a lot going on

18:01.414 --> 18:04.626
and I don't...

18:06.503 --> 18:09.088
I don't want my problems

18:06.503 --> 18:09.088
to become your problems.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.257
Dad, you disappearing

18:09.380 --> 18:11.257
is my problem.

18:11.382 --> 18:14.260
-Janie--

18:11.382 --> 18:14.260
-No, just wait for a second.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.889
You feeling guilty and

18:14.678 --> 18:17.889
being gone, it's just making

18:14.678 --> 18:17.889
all this worse.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.892
Did you even known that Mom

18:18.473 --> 18:20.892
is dating some other guy?

18:22.352 --> 18:24.980
Yeah, I heard that.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.691
OK, so, do you have a plan to do

18:25.104 --> 18:27.691
something about that?

18:28.733 --> 18:30.360
There's nothing

18:28.733 --> 18:30.360
I can do about it.

18:34.197 --> 18:37.826
Can I take you out to dinner?

18:34.197 --> 18:37.826
I just need to get cleaned up.

18:40.871 --> 18:44.457
-Mom is expecting me home.

18:40.871 --> 18:44.457
-OK.

18:46.668 --> 18:49.295
Maybe we take the long way home.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.423
It gives us the chance to chat.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.010
-OK, I'd like that.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.010
-OK.

If you got problems you guys

19:49.439 --> 19:51.775
want me to fix for you...

19:54.444 --> 19:57.238
-You should have called, Paul.

19:54.444 --> 19:57.238
-He was just driving me home.

19:57.948 --> 20:01.034
Why don't you help me out in

19:57.948 --> 20:01.034
the kitchen and we give your

19:57.948 --> 20:01.034
parents a chance to talk.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.288
-Go on.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.288
-Yeah, okay.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.000
Let's talk outside.

20:14.923 --> 20:17.050
-Wait, is that on?

20:14.923 --> 20:17.050
-I'm helping.

20:17.175 --> 20:20.178
-No, that's not safe.

-You have to keep stirring the

20:17.175 --> 20:20.178

I'm sorry, Jane

20:35.693 --> 20:37.904
about all this.

20:38.529 --> 20:40.490
I never meant to cause your

20:41.116 --> 20:44.119
No, it wasn't you.

They're just...

20:58.008 --> 21:00.551
-You don't get to decide that.

20:58.008 --> 21:00.551
-Yes, I do. It's my house.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.179
-Guys!

21:00.677 --> 21:02.179
-[Brian] Paul.

21:02.971 --> 21:05.431
Let's dial it down a notch, OK?

21:02.971 --> 21:05.431
There's a kid in here.

21:05.556 --> 21:08.143
Yeah, my kid. And who the hell

21:05.556 --> 21:08.143
are you, anyway?

21:08.267 --> 21:11.896
-He's my guest.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.896
-We're gonna cool off, take a

21:08.267 --> 21:11.896
breath and step down, yeah?

21:12.022 --> 21:14.232
-You don't get

21:12.022 --> 21:14.232
to tell me what to do.

21:12.022 --> 21:14.232
-Dad.

21:14.398 --> 21:17.694
-Paul you don't scream at my

21:14.398 --> 21:17.694
invited guest and any--

21:14.398 --> 21:17.694
-Mom.

21:17.819 --> 21:21.031
-What! He started it.

21:17.819 --> 21:21.031
-No, I'm the one who started it,

21:17.819 --> 21:21.031
bringing me back.

21:21.156 --> 21:23.616
I'm sleeping with your wife and

21:21.156 --> 21:23.616
I'm gonna raise your kids as

21:21.156 --> 21:23.616
my own.

21:23.741 --> 21:24.951
[Sam] But to make this

21:23.741 --> 21:24.951
obviously--

21:25.076 --> 21:25.994
[punch]

21:26.119 --> 21:27.411
-Paul!

21:26.119 --> 21:27.411
-Dad!

21:27.537 --> 21:28.872
Get your ass out of here.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.749
Dad! What is wrong with you?

21:32.083 --> 21:34.293
-I'm calling the police.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.293
-You don't have to call the--

21:34.418 --> 21:36.337
Don't make this any worse.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.382
Janie. Jane!

21:41.384 --> 21:42.426
[Brian grunts]

21:55.106 --> 21:56.149
[Jane] He's gonna be okay.

21:57.192 --> 21:59.318
[Till] Is he...

21:57.192 --> 21:59.318
What happened, Jane?

21:59.819 --> 22:01.529
Nothing. It was just

21:59.819 --> 22:01.529
an accident.

22:02.780 --> 22:05.658
Accidents are okay.

22:02.780 --> 22:05.658
Mommy told me so.

22:07.285 --> 22:08.327
Yeah.

22:10.663 --> 22:11.956
You're gonna be okay, OK?

22:29.724 --> 22:30.767
[sighs]

22:38.816 --> 22:40.568
[Brian whispering] <i> Maybe we</i>

22:38.816 --> 22:40.568
<i>shouldn't...</i>

22:42.737 --> 22:46.991
see each other for a while,

22:42.737 --> 22:46.991
just until things around here

22:42.737 --> 22:46.991
settle.

22:47.284 --> 22:51.662
-That's the last thing I want.

22:47.284 --> 22:51.662
-Whatever you think is best.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.042
[Brian and Sam smooching]

22:59.629 --> 23:01.672
[Mitch] Good news is

22:59.629 --> 23:01.672
he's not pressing charges.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.466
-So, that's something.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.466
-That's good.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.553
Bad news is your wife

23:04.383 --> 23:07.553
has filed for a restraining

23:04.383 --> 23:07.553
order against you.

23:08.763 --> 23:13.017
-Can she do that?

23:08.763 --> 23:13.017
-I've seen the boy toy's face.

23:08.763 --> 23:13.017
Yes, she absolutely can.

23:13.935 --> 23:18.148
He said he was sleeping with my

23:13.935 --> 23:18.148
wife and was gonna raise my

23:13.935 --> 23:18.148
kids.

23:18.940 --> 23:21.276
There is a hearing in two days.

23:18.940 --> 23:21.276
Go and make your case to the

23:18.940 --> 23:21.276
judge.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.321
Preferably in something that

23:21.400 --> 23:24.321
doesn't smell of bourbon and

23:21.400 --> 23:24.321
cigarettes.

23:25.113 --> 23:28.449
Oh, I don't normally...

23:25.113 --> 23:28.449
You know, it was a work thing.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.744
-I'll check in

23:29.450 --> 23:31.744
with you tomorrow.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.744
-Yeah.

23:33.288 --> 23:34.331
Thanks.

23:42.672 --> 23:43.631
[Sam] I'm off to the gym.

23:45.216 --> 23:48.261
Jane, do you want me to make

23:45.216 --> 23:48.261
another appointment with Brian

23:45.216 --> 23:48.261
for your training?

23:49.804 --> 23:53.183
I can keep doing

23:49.804 --> 23:53.183
my exercises at home. Thanks.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.768
Sure. It's your choice.

23:56.811 --> 24:00.273
-Hey, have either of you

23:56.811 --> 24:00.273
seen my bracelet?

23:56.811 --> 24:00.273
-No.

24:01.858 --> 24:02.942
Jane?

24:04.277 --> 24:06.321
-What?

24:04.277 --> 24:06.321
-Have you seen my bracelet?

24:07.322 --> 24:09.032
-Your new one?

24:07.322 --> 24:09.032
-Yeah.

24:09.699 --> 24:10.950
Um, no.

24:12.827 --> 24:14.287
Okay, I'll keep an eye out.

24:15.538 --> 24:17.790
I'm going to the gym and

24:15.538 --> 24:17.790
I'm doing some errands.

24:18.666 --> 24:21.169
-Stay out of trouble.

24:18.666 --> 24:21.169
-Bye.

24:23.504 --> 24:26.841
So, who is ready for a day of

24:23.504 --> 24:26.841
watching me study?

24:28.051 --> 24:30.845
-Yay...

24:28.051 --> 24:30.845
-Okay.

24:33.723 --> 24:34.724
[exhales]

24:37.810 --> 24:39.729
She's never been

24:37.810 --> 24:39.729
this closed off before.

24:40.563 --> 24:43.691
No matter what happened

24:40.563 --> 24:43.691
we could always talk about it.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.862
I know she is very upset

24:45.818 --> 24:47.862
about the separation.

24:48.196 --> 24:51.699
I mean, I made Paul leave to

24:48.196 --> 24:51.699
protect the girls from him.

24:53.368 --> 24:56.954
Hey, it's okay. We're gonna

24:53.368 --> 24:56.954
get you through this.

24:58.248 --> 24:59.749
Just tell me how I can help

25:02.043 --> 25:03.711
-How can I help?

25:02.043 --> 25:03.711
-Just hold me.

25:03.836 --> 25:04.879
Okay.

25:09.133 --> 25:10.176
[Brian sighs]

25:13.346 --> 25:14.389
[Sam sobbing]

25:20.186 --> 25:22.897
Hi, how are my girls

25:20.186 --> 25:22.897
holding up?

25:23.647 --> 25:26.943
-We found your present.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.943
-We...?

25:27.735 --> 25:30.196
-What are you talking about?

25:27.735 --> 25:30.196
-Ta-dah!

25:30.447 --> 25:33.616
-Oh, thank you.

25:30.447 --> 25:33.616
-It was in my shoe.

25:33.741 --> 25:34.700
Ah!

25:36.411 --> 25:40.415
But tomorrow night we are

25:36.411 --> 25:40.415
gonna go the movies and you

25:36.411 --> 25:40.415
are gonna decide what we see.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.709
Tomorrow night, why not tonight?

25:44.543 --> 25:45.795
Because I have plans tonight.

25:47.755 --> 25:48.881
With Brian?

25:51.801 --> 25:56.306
After last night maybe you

25:51.801 --> 25:56.306
should, I don't know,

25:51.801 --> 25:56.306
maybe back off.

25:57.474 --> 26:00.977
I appreciate your concern, but

25:57.474 --> 26:00.977
I don't need your input

25:57.474 --> 26:00.977
when I'm--

26:02.520 --> 26:03.646
Clasp is broken.

26:05.148 --> 26:06.316
I'll take it to the jewelers'.

26:14.907 --> 26:18.869
[laughter in the background]

26:23.249 --> 26:27.337
[laughing outside]

26:40.724 --> 26:41.767
[ominous music]

27:34.945 --> 27:35.988
[ominous music]

27:51.754 --> 27:53.756
[door creaks]

28:30.251 --> 28:31.294
[ominous music]

28:55.568 --> 28:56.486
Hi, sweetheart.

28:56.735 --> 28:57.695
Hey.

28:58.655 --> 29:01.491
Quick question: Is that what you

28:58.655 --> 29:01.491
are wearing today?

29:01.616 --> 29:02.866
To exercise, yeah.

29:03.284 --> 29:06.078
It's just that

29:03.284 --> 29:06.078
I was talking to Brian and

29:06.954 --> 29:09.248
he would really like to take you

29:06.954 --> 29:09.248
out to lunch today.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.626
You know, so you can get to

29:09.915 --> 29:11.626
know each other better.

29:13.294 --> 29:15.338
Why do you keep springing

29:13.294 --> 29:15.338
things on me, Mom?

29:16.088 --> 29:17.965
So you wouldn't have time

29:16.088 --> 29:17.965
to come up with excuses.

29:21.344 --> 29:22.970
When is this lunch

29:21.344 --> 29:22.970
supposed to happen?

29:27.308 --> 29:28.309
Now-ish.

29:30.311 --> 29:31.312
Awesome.

29:31.812 --> 29:32.855
[sighs]

29:34.482 --> 29:36.651
Maybe wear the dress

29:34.482 --> 29:36.651
that we bought the other day.

29:44.534 --> 29:45.576
-Hi.

29:44.534 --> 29:45.576
-Already set?

29:46.452 --> 29:48.787
Yeah, other than

29:46.452 --> 29:48.787
a little grumbling.

29:50.247 --> 29:51.790
You're not wearing

29:50.247 --> 29:51.790
your bracelet.

29:52.375 --> 29:55.127
That's funny. You didn't notice

29:52.375 --> 29:55.127
I wasn't wearing it last night.

29:55.586 --> 29:58.589
-Last night I had more

29:55.586 --> 29:58.589
important things on my mind.

29:55.586 --> 29:58.589
-Yes, you did.

30:00.966 --> 30:04.220
It's no big deal, but the clasp

30:00.966 --> 30:04.220
broke, so I took it into

30:00.966 --> 30:04.220
Meyer's.

30:04.845 --> 30:05.763
Meyer's?

30:06.389 --> 30:07.431
It's where you bought it, right?

30:07.848 --> 30:09.058
They said I could

30:07.848 --> 30:09.058
pick it up today.

30:10.351 --> 30:12.311
-Why don't you let me

30:10.351 --> 30:12.311
pick it up?

30:10.351 --> 30:12.311
-You don't mind?

30:12.770 --> 30:15.898
No, honestly, it's right across

30:12.770 --> 30:15.898
the restaurant

30:12.770 --> 30:15.898
I'm taking Jane to.

30:16.733 --> 30:18.942
You are a lifesaver,

30:16.733 --> 30:18.942
thank you.

30:19.694 --> 30:23.072
-My pleasure.

30:19.694 --> 30:23.072
-Here is the ticket.

30:24.198 --> 30:26.909
-And they said it would cost--

30:24.198 --> 30:26.909
-Whoa, put your money away.

30:27.744 --> 30:30.287
Seriously, if they are not gonna

30:27.744 --> 30:30.287
guarantee the work, then I will.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.540
What kind of gift would it be

30:30.829 --> 30:32.540
if I didn't?

30:33.916 --> 30:35.042
You are so sweet.

30:37.795 --> 30:39.338
-Ahem.

30:37.795 --> 30:39.338
-Oh.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.510
-What did I say? You look great.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.510
-Ready for lunch?

30:45.428 --> 30:46.429
As I'll ever be.

30:54.228 --> 30:56.230
Alright. Do you wanna go in

30:54.228 --> 30:56.230
and get us a table?

30:56.731 --> 30:58.899
I need a sec to pick up

30:56.731 --> 30:58.899
something for your mother

30:56.731 --> 30:58.899
in Meyer's.

30:59.442 --> 31:01.402
-Yeah, OK, I can do that.

30:59.442 --> 31:01.402
-I'll be two seconds.

31:02.486 --> 31:06.490
Oh, if a friend of yours

31:02.486 --> 31:06.490
incidentally just happens to

31:02.486 --> 31:06.490
turn up out of the blue

31:06.616 --> 31:09.827
to act as a conversational

31:06.616 --> 31:09.827
buffer, I won't be offended.

31:10.787 --> 31:11.829
Sure.

31:13.706 --> 31:14.749
Be right back.

31:17.126 --> 31:18.919
-Excuse me.

31:17.126 --> 31:18.919
-Oh, thank you.

31:20.463 --> 31:21.464
Hi there.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.551
-How can I help you today, sir?

31:23.507 --> 31:25.551
-I'm here to pick up a bracelet.

31:26.594 --> 31:28.679
-Of course.

31:26.594 --> 31:28.679
-It seems you were fixing

31:26.594 --> 31:28.679
the clasp?

31:31.599 --> 31:32.642
I have it right here.

31:36.771 --> 31:38.939
-It's a stunning piece.

31:36.771 --> 31:38.939
-That's the one.

31:39.982 --> 31:42.568
Girls certainly think so.

31:39.982 --> 31:42.568
How much do I owe you?

31:43.068 --> 31:46.363
-You don't remember me, do you?

31:43.068 --> 31:46.363
-Should I?

31:47.197 --> 31:48.240
Don't bother pretending.

31:48.991 --> 31:51.744
I was here three years ago

31:48.991 --> 31:51.744
when you bought this bracelet.

31:53.036 --> 31:55.038
-What are you talking about?

31:53.036 --> 31:55.038
-Fine.

31:57.291 --> 31:58.375
Let me tell you a story.

31:59.209 --> 32:01.003
About a handsome young man

31:59.209 --> 32:01.003
who came into

32:01.128 --> 32:03.005
a jewelry store

32:01.128 --> 32:03.005
a number of times.

32:03.130 --> 32:07.176
With an older wealthy woman,

32:03.130 --> 32:07.176
whom we're gonna call, Lady A.

32:08.302 --> 32:10.471
Then after a few months

32:08.302 --> 32:10.471
lo and behold

32:10.596 --> 32:12.890
he's been authorized

32:10.596 --> 32:12.890
to buy things on her account.

32:13.808 --> 32:16.935
Sure enough one day he comes in

32:13.808 --> 32:16.935
and he buys this bracelet.

32:17.687 --> 32:20.690
But for another woman, Lady B.

32:21.190 --> 32:24.401
Similarly, he'll heed this

32:21.190 --> 32:24.401
woman, but not too long after

32:21.190 --> 32:24.401
that,

32:24.527 --> 32:27.279
Lady A suddenly dies

32:24.527 --> 32:27.279
in an accident.

32:27.864 --> 32:30.240
And later that year, Lady B

32:30.366 --> 32:32.702
suddenly is not around

32:30.366 --> 32:32.702
anymore either.

32:33.327 --> 32:34.286
Hum.

32:35.078 --> 32:36.163
Now let's fast-forward a year.

32:36.873 --> 32:39.416
A new Lady C

32:36.873 --> 32:39.416
walks into this store

32:39.917 --> 32:43.671
holding the exact same bracelet.

32:44.380 --> 32:46.382
Now, let's talk about

32:46.507 --> 32:48.843
what you can do for me.

32:48.967 --> 32:49.844
Shut your mouth.

32:50.427 --> 32:51.929
I did date a lovely older woman

32:52.054 --> 32:53.931
and she was prone to buying me

32:52.054 --> 32:53.931
nice things.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.266
Then she died peacefully

32:54.306 --> 32:56.266
in her sleep.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.728
-And I loved her.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.728
-What about Lady B?

32:59.061 --> 33:00.062
Quit it with your algebra, man.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.356
This is my life that

33:00.646 --> 33:02.356
we're talking about.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.526
So, why don't we step back and

33:03.190 --> 33:05.526
game this out for a second.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.321
Your absolute

33:06.652 --> 33:09.321
best case scenario.

33:09.906 --> 33:11.824
You go to the police

33:09.906 --> 33:11.824
with your crazy story.

33:12.241 --> 33:14.660
They come back to me armed with

33:12.241 --> 33:14.660
a complete lack of evidence

33:14.785 --> 33:18.121
and after I have politely

33:14.785 --> 33:18.121
acquiesced and answered all

33:14.785 --> 33:18.121
their questions

33:18.247 --> 33:20.123
and they've gone,

33:18.247 --> 33:20.123
what am I gonna do then?

33:21.166 --> 33:24.461
If you like stories so much,

33:21.166 --> 33:24.461
do you care to offer

33:21.166 --> 33:24.461
a hypothetical?

33:26.129 --> 33:28.340
You're probably thinking that

33:26.129 --> 33:28.340
if you turn up dead in an

33:26.129 --> 33:28.340
alleyway,

33:28.465 --> 33:30.676
after going to the police

33:28.465 --> 33:30.676
they'll know it was me.

33:31.552 --> 33:33.303
Maybe, but here is the thing,

33:33.429 --> 33:36.599
there's an enormous difference

33:33.429 --> 33:36.599
between knowing something

33:36.724 --> 33:38.392
and actually

33:36.724 --> 33:38.392
being able to prove it.

33:39.643 --> 33:40.686
So, hypothetically...

33:42.354 --> 33:45.315
That's how you want this thing

33:42.354 --> 33:45.315
to end, dead in an alleyway?

33:47.902 --> 33:51.321
-I asked you a question.

33:47.902 --> 33:51.321
-No, no.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.785
Now, am I going to hear

33:52.531 --> 33:55.785
another word of your stupid

33:52.531 --> 33:55.785
little mouth?

33:58.621 --> 34:02.750
Good. It's a rhetorical question

33:58.621 --> 34:02.750
you saw right through it.

33:58.621 --> 34:02.750
I'm impressed.

34:07.463 --> 34:09.547
You'd better pray that the

34:07.463 --> 34:09.547
traffic cop doesn't so much as

34:09.672 --> 34:12.551
give me a second look

34:09.672 --> 34:12.551
at the red light,

34:09.672 --> 34:12.551
or I will be back.

34:12.676 --> 34:13.719
[ominous music]

34:23.437 --> 34:24.480
Ta-dah!

34:25.563 --> 34:27.149
I'm only 17.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.234
Don't worry about that,

34:27.690 --> 34:29.234
I told them you're 21.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.280
I hope you don't mind.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.280
That would be a nice icebreaker.

34:33.864 --> 34:36.659
I had my first drink

34:33.864 --> 34:36.659
at my parents' basement.

34:33.864 --> 34:36.659
This is way cooler.

34:37.868 --> 34:40.120
I had my first drink in a park

34:37.868 --> 34:40.120
and I threw up.

34:40.496 --> 34:42.080
So, you're saying this isn't

34:40.496 --> 34:42.080
your first?

34:42.205 --> 34:44.792
I'm saying I think

34:42.205 --> 34:44.792
alcohol tastes horrible.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.128
Ah, I bet you can't even

34:46.293 --> 34:48.128
taste it in this.

34:50.965 --> 34:52.007
[sighs]

34:58.221 --> 34:59.974
-It's not that bad. Yeah.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.974
-Right?

35:04.520 --> 35:06.730
Don't you think this is gonna

35:04.520 --> 35:06.730
interact with my painkillers?

35:06.856 --> 35:09.650
No.

35:06.856 --> 35:09.650
I'm sure you will be fine.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.568
Why, is your leg still

35:10.233 --> 35:11.568
hurting a lot?

35:12.194 --> 35:13.612
You wouldn't believe how bad.

35:14.655 --> 35:17.867
I can't imagine the strength

35:14.655 --> 35:17.867
and courage it takes to go

35:14.655 --> 35:17.867
through something like that.

35:20.536 --> 35:22.955
So, my mother,

35:20.536 --> 35:22.955
what's happening now?

35:23.706 --> 35:25.041
Maybe I should cut you off.

35:25.374 --> 35:28.085
-That's why we're here,

35:25.374 --> 35:28.085
isn't it?

35:25.374 --> 35:28.085
-Okay.

35:29.211 --> 35:30.295
Go.

35:30.587 --> 35:32.089
-Age difference.

35:30.587 --> 35:32.089
-Doesn't bother me.

35:32.548 --> 35:33.799
-Children?

35:32.548 --> 35:33.799
-I think they're great.

35:33.924 --> 35:34.925
Gold-digger.

35:35.509 --> 35:37.678
I'm doing fine on my own,

35:35.509 --> 35:37.678
thank you very much.

35:39.763 --> 35:41.640
-I don't get it.

35:39.763 --> 35:41.640
-You don't have to.

35:42.432 --> 35:46.478
Seriously, you don't have to

35:42.432 --> 35:46.478
like me. You don't even

35:42.432 --> 35:46.478
have to trust me.

35:47.187 --> 35:49.899
I don't expect anything from you

35:47.187 --> 35:49.899
except maybe, a chance.

35:50.691 --> 35:53.819
Watch me like hawk if you like,

35:50.691 --> 35:53.819
except don't judge me.

35:55.445 --> 35:57.531
But I do like your mother

35:55.445 --> 35:57.531
a lot.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.242
I'm gonna treat her right.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.242
So going forward,

36:01.118 --> 36:04.038
why don't you let me know if I'm

36:01.118 --> 36:04.038
up to your standards or not.

36:05.414 --> 36:08.125
Okay. Provisionally.

36:09.043 --> 36:10.086
Okay.

36:13.255 --> 36:14.631
Excuse me. Can you check this?

36:14.757 --> 36:15.841
-Of course.

36:14.757 --> 36:15.841
-Thanks.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.260
All business?

36:19.053 --> 36:20.804
I'm sure you'd rather be

36:19.053 --> 36:20.804
hanging out with your friends.

36:21.388 --> 36:23.015
I'm just happy that we had

36:21.388 --> 36:23.015
the chance to talk.

36:24.767 --> 36:26.476
Yeah, that's cool, ha.

36:29.146 --> 36:30.814
What do you say we drink up

36:29.146 --> 36:30.814
and get out of here.

36:37.571 --> 36:38.614
[soft music]

37:03.097 --> 37:04.140
Hey!

37:08.144 --> 37:09.186
Don't be mad.

37:10.062 --> 37:10.938
It's nothing bad.

37:11.981 --> 37:14.274
-Why would you say that?

37:11.981 --> 37:14.274
-Just need to

37:11.981 --> 37:14.274
run something by you.

37:15.151 --> 37:16.568
-Today at lunch...

37:15.151 --> 37:16.568
-Aha.

37:16.860 --> 37:17.778
Jane wanted to have a drink.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.405
She told me that sometimes on

37:18.737 --> 37:20.405
special occasions

37:20.530 --> 37:22.158
you would let her have

37:20.530 --> 37:22.158
a little bit of alcohol.

37:22.491 --> 37:24.118
I didn't think it was

37:22.491 --> 37:24.118
very trust building

37:24.451 --> 37:26.536
if I were to call you and ask,

37:24.451 --> 37:26.536
especially in front of her.

37:26.829 --> 37:29.915
So, I kinda, sort of went along

37:26.829 --> 37:29.915
with it, I hope you're

37:26.829 --> 37:29.915
cool with that.

37:30.499 --> 37:31.792
I'm a little surprised.

37:32.417 --> 37:35.129
But it is true, I do let her

37:32.417 --> 37:35.129
have a sip from time to time.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.213
It's just...

37:36.713 --> 37:38.882
She is in pain medication

37:36.713 --> 37:38.882
right now.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.718
I'm sorry, Sam,

37:39.883 --> 37:41.718
I totally forgot.

37:42.219 --> 37:43.261
Where is she? Is she okay?

37:43.386 --> 37:44.513
Ah, yeah, she's at Karli's.

37:44.638 --> 37:46.431
I dropped her off, she's great.

37:47.850 --> 37:49.309
-I'm gonna give her a call.

37:47.850 --> 37:49.309
-Why?

37:49.893 --> 37:51.687
I mean, it was diluted,

37:49.893 --> 37:51.687
she had a few sips.

37:52.354 --> 37:53.897
I had my first drink a lot

37:52.354 --> 37:53.897
younger and look at me,

37:54.023 --> 37:55.941
the picture of health,

37:54.023 --> 37:55.941

37:57.067 --> 37:57.901
Alright?

37:58.485 --> 38:00.362
-Are you sure?

37:58.485 --> 38:00.362
-A hundred percent sure.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.283
-I brought you something.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.283
-You did?

38:05.575 --> 38:06.618
Yeah.

38:08.370 --> 38:11.874
-Ta-dah.

38:08.370 --> 38:11.874
-Ah.

38:11.999 --> 38:14.459
You are so beautiful.

38:15.752 --> 38:18.797
And you worry too much,

38:15.752 --> 38:18.797
you are a terrific mother.

38:19.965 --> 38:22.300
[Jane] I still don't know how

38:19.965 --> 38:22.300
are you supposed to spend

38:22.968 --> 38:26.222
two hours with someone

38:22.968 --> 38:26.222
and still not have

38:22.968 --> 38:26.222
an impression of them.

38:26.513 --> 38:28.390
Well, it helps if

38:26.513 --> 38:28.390
you are not sauced.

38:29.725 --> 38:31.227
I knew I shouldn't have

38:29.725 --> 38:31.227
told you.

38:31.351 --> 38:32.936
I'm gonna hold that one

38:31.351 --> 38:32.936
for a while.

38:34.354 --> 38:36.857
Seriously though,

38:34.354 --> 38:36.857
your mom seems happy

38:36.982 --> 38:38.817
and he seems nice enough.

38:39.818 --> 38:40.861
What's eating you?

38:42.154 --> 38:43.197
It's just...

38:44.865 --> 38:46.825
I thought we were a family,

38:44.865 --> 38:46.825
you know?

38:47.617 --> 38:51.663
Like... through all the crap and

38:47.617 --> 38:51.663
all that fighting,

38:52.039 --> 38:53.040
we were in this together.

38:53.957 --> 38:56.210
But I guess it is just

38:53.957 --> 38:56.210
every man for himself.

38:58.461 --> 39:01.173
It sucks, but tough it out for

38:58.461 --> 39:01.173
three more months.

39:01.590 --> 39:05.135
Then you're in college

39:01.590 --> 39:05.135
and all of this seems

39:01.590 --> 39:05.135
like petty nonsense.

39:05.261 --> 39:07.263
Yeah, if I pass

39:05.261 --> 39:07.263
my exam on Wednesday.

39:07.512 --> 39:08.931
Well, what are you doing

39:07.512 --> 39:08.931
talking to me?

39:09.347 --> 39:10.515
Go hit those books, girl.

39:11.225 --> 39:12.809
If you are not too wasted.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.145
Yeah, you're probably right.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.572
-Love you, Jane.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.572
-Love you too.

[soft music]

40:11.493 --> 40:12.535
How is your leg feeling?

40:14.288 --> 40:15.831
-Not better.

40:14.288 --> 40:15.831
-Wow.

40:15.956 --> 40:18.041
You have been pushing

40:15.956 --> 40:18.041
yourself a lot lately.

40:19.709 --> 40:20.919
Maybe you should

40:19.709 --> 40:20.919
see Brian again.

40:21.670 --> 40:23.755
I think we see enough

40:21.670 --> 40:23.755
of him already.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.424
He said you had

40:24.923 --> 40:26.424
a really fun lunch.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.136
We did. I'm just saying.

40:30.346 --> 40:31.388
[tense music]

40:33.182 --> 40:34.224
Okay.

40:42.358 --> 40:45.152
Then it turns out he has

40:42.358 --> 40:45.152
the one the whole time.

40:45.277 --> 40:47.196
I did not see that coming.

40:47.779 --> 40:48.780
I didn't.

40:59.082 --> 41:00.583
Are you back on the crutches?

41:02.378 --> 41:03.420
Yeah.

41:11.594 --> 41:13.430
Samantha, how many pills

41:11.594 --> 41:13.430
is she taking every day?

41:13.930 --> 41:14.848
I don't know.

41:15.724 --> 41:17.393
The doctor says that

41:15.724 --> 41:17.393
we should monitor them but...

41:17.517 --> 41:18.435
What does that mean?

41:18.560 --> 41:19.936
If she is in pain

41:20.062 --> 41:23.899
-she has to take them, right?

41:20.062 --> 41:23.899
-Right.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.776
I got something in my car.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.776
I'll be right back.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.627
[ominous music]

41:50.008 --> 41:52.010
-Hey, Paul.

41:50.008 --> 41:52.010
-Hi.

Listen, I've got this app, OK?

41:54.054 --> 41:55.180
Fancy new stuff.

Now you can press start

41:55.513 --> 41:57.724
anywhere, anytime

41:57.849 --> 41:59.851

41:57.849 --> 41:59.851
you've travelled.

So, for example I was over there

41:59.976 --> 42:02.062
in the driveway,

42:02.187 --> 42:04.522
which, as you well know,

42:02.187 --> 42:04.522
is on the property

42:04.647 --> 42:06.900
then I came all the way

42:04.647 --> 42:06.900
over here and

42:07.484 --> 42:09.152
would you look at that, ha?

42:13.698 --> 42:15.242
Very naughty, Paul.

42:15.367 --> 42:17.035
It's just I wanted you

42:15.367 --> 42:17.035
to know that I know.

42:17.660 --> 42:20.497
It's also important to know

42:17.660 --> 42:20.497
that I have a record

42:20.622 --> 42:22.540
of how you feel about

42:20.622 --> 42:22.540

42:23.541 --> 42:27.254
Understand? Cool.

42:23.541 --> 42:27.254

42:38.223 --> 42:39.557
run me over, Paul?

42:39.933 --> 42:42.519
Hm, it's a risky move.

42:39.933 --> 42:42.519
I'm very impressed.

42:42.644 --> 42:44.854
It's not exactly gonna win you

42:42.644 --> 42:44.854
any friends around here.

42:45.981 --> 42:47.316
What the hell do I care, right?

42:47.899 --> 42:49.692
C'mon. What? Take your shot.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.543
-Will do.

43:10.797 --> 43:15.760
Pen is in there, my calculator.

43:10.797 --> 43:15.760
And my pills?

43:16.219 --> 43:18.347
I figured you wouldn't be taking

43:16.219 --> 43:18.347
them for the next two hours.

43:18.472 --> 43:20.682
It's a three hours exam, mom.

43:18.472 --> 43:20.682

43:21.850 --> 43:22.851
Now!

44:00.556 --> 44:03.766
I'm fine. I'm okay.

44:00.556 --> 44:03.766
I'll deal with it.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.937
-Yeah.

Do you think things

44:49.854 --> 44:51.856
are going to be normal again?

44:52.941 --> 44:55.693
Well, sweetie,

44:52.941 --> 44:55.693
I think normal is overrated.

44:56.861 --> 44:59.448
Your mother and your sister

44:56.861 --> 44:59.448
are just going through a hard

-But you can help them.

45:00.198 --> 45:02.867
-I can?

45:03.368 --> 45:06.413
Yes, absolutely. I mean, once

45:03.368 --> 45:06.413
they see how strong you can be,

45:06.913 --> 45:10.375
that inspires them to be even

45:06.913 --> 45:10.375
stronger. Do you understand?

45:11.501 --> 45:14.879
Yeah, but... I'm scared.

45:15.713 --> 45:20.051
-You don't have to be.

45:15.713 --> 45:20.051
Guess what?

-What?

You're probably just hungry.

[dramatic music]

47:32.308 --> 47:35.812
It's very good. Now I just need

47:32.308 --> 47:35.812
to ask you a few questions about

47:32.308 --> 47:35.812
what happened

47:36.062 --> 47:37.897
and then I can bring

47:36.062 --> 47:37.897
your family over.

47:39.148 --> 47:41.735
-Okay.

47:39.148 --> 47:41.735
-Can you tell me what day it is?

It's, ah...

We've almost lost you once.

48:17.061 --> 48:19.773
I'm not going to let you

48:17.061 --> 48:19.773
throw your life away.

48:21.023 --> 48:23.943
Do you have any idea of what

48:21.023 --> 48:23.943
this is doing to your family?

48:25.027 --> 48:26.070
You're right.

48:29.783 --> 48:30.826
Okay.

48:35.705 --> 48:39.793
I've been blaming you.

48:35.705 --> 48:39.793
and Brian and myself.

48:40.752 --> 48:45.214
I've been trying everything

48:40.752 --> 48:45.214
to get Dad out of the hook

48:40.752 --> 48:45.214
and it's been killing me.

48:46.716 --> 48:48.050
I can't do it anymore.

48:48.301 --> 48:51.387
Oh, honey, I know

48:48.301 --> 48:51.387
this is so hard.

48:52.639 --> 48:55.558
But you've to know that this is

48:52.639 --> 48:55.558
the first step to you getting

48:52.639 --> 48:55.558
better.

48:57.519 --> 48:58.561
Can I see him?

49:01.314 --> 49:03.733
Oh, no, honey, I don't think

49:01.314 --> 49:03.733
that's a good idea.

49:04.275 --> 49:05.151
No, I have to.

49:06.277 --> 49:09.071
I have to tell him what he did,

49:06.277 --> 49:09.071
make him understand and then

49:09.197 --> 49:10.365
I'll never see him again.

49:10.866 --> 49:11.908
Okay?

49:12.784 --> 49:13.827
Okay.

49:14.536 --> 49:15.578

Close the door.

49:35.932 --> 49:37.183
You need to listen to me

very carefully.

49:39.018 --> 49:41.396
yesterday.

49:39.018 --> 49:41.396
-What?

49:42.271 --> 49:44.524
For the past two weeks my pain

49:42.271 --> 49:44.524
has been getting worse.

49:44.982 --> 49:47.694
I've been taking more and more

49:44.982 --> 49:47.694
pills and they haven't

49:44.982 --> 49:47.694
done a thing.

49:48.110 --> 49:52.448
And then, I take five this

49:48.110 --> 49:52.448
morning and it hits me

49:48.110 --> 49:52.448
like a truck.

49:53.366 --> 49:55.744
I'm apparently lucky that

49:53.366 --> 49:55.744
my liver didn't shut down.

49:56.452 --> 49:59.205
The only possible explanation is

49:56.452 --> 49:59.205
that my pills were switched

49:59.330 --> 50:01.332
for placebos or something

49:59.330 --> 50:01.332
and then switched back.

50:02.083 --> 50:04.293
-That's crazy.

50:02.083 --> 50:04.293
-Maybe he's crazy.

50:04.836 --> 50:07.630
Maybe it's part of a bigger

50:04.836 --> 50:07.630
plan, I don't know but

50:04.836 --> 50:07.630
it happened, Dad.

50:08.631 --> 50:11.300
-Okay, did you tell your mother

50:08.631 --> 50:11.300
about this?

50:08.631 --> 50:11.300
-No.

50:13.135 --> 50:17.139
Okay, look...

50:13.135 --> 50:17.139
We should go to the police.

50:17.265 --> 50:19.350
This is exactly what I need

50:17.265 --> 50:19.350
to get the restraining order

50:17.265 --> 50:19.350
reversed.

50:19.475 --> 50:22.437
No, they're not going to believe

50:19.475 --> 50:22.437
me. I don't have any proof.

50:23.271 --> 50:25.147
And more importantly it's on my

50:23.271 --> 50:25.147
medical record that

50:25.273 --> 50:27.275
I'm addicted to painkillers

50:25.273 --> 50:27.275
and may have

50:27.400 --> 50:28.651
attempted suicide.

50:28.777 --> 50:30.445

a lot of time with my wife

55:05.094 --> 55:07.805

55:08.597 --> 55:10.099
I need to know more about him.

55:11.392 --> 55:17.190
Yeah, OK, I will make some calls

55:11.392 --> 55:17.190
and look into a few things.

55:17.481 --> 55:18.524

-That's not a word.

55:24.697 --> 55:26.741
-Sure it is.

55:24.697 --> 55:26.741
-Use it in a sentence.

55:27.616 --> 55:32.038
-Err... Meego to the mall.

55:27.616 --> 55:32.038
-Put it back.

Hey, does anyone want

55:32.163 --> 55:33.873
to go out tomorrow night?

55:34.373 --> 55:35.708
I'm feeling a little cooped up.

55:37.293 --> 55:39.128
-Dinner and a movie?

55:37.293 --> 55:39.128
-It sounds good to me.

55:39.712 --> 55:41.923
-Can I pick.

Good job.

55:55.019 --> 55:56.854
Good job.

55:58.898 --> 56:00.482
I'm off to make

-Where's your mom?

57:35.870 --> 57:39.665
-She is outside with Till.

57:39.790 --> 57:42.293
Fixing the garden or something.

57:39.790 --> 57:42.293
I can't keep track.

57:42.418 --> 57:44.379
You're back on your cane.

57:42.418 --> 57:44.379
Jane, that's great.

All new and

57:44.503 --> 57:48.549
I am just stronger than ever.

-I know.

58:09.195 --> 58:10.612
-What's going on?

58:11.239 --> 58:13.449
-Jane is in too much pain

58:11.239 --> 58:13.449
to come.

-Oh.

58:14.409 --> 58:19.038
-But, we're still going?

You promised.

58:19.163 --> 58:20.206
You think you'll be alright?

58:20.497 --> 58:21.832
I don't wanna cause any

58:20.497 --> 58:21.832
problems.

58:22.417 --> 58:23.709
I think I just pushed it

58:22.417 --> 58:23.709
too hard.

58:24.377 --> 58:25.878
I'll take a nap and then

58:26.003 --> 58:27.671
when you guys get home

58:26.003 --> 58:27.671
we can go out for a walk.

58:28.381 --> 58:29.882
I can show you

58:28.381 --> 58:29.882
how much better I'm doing.

58:30.258 --> 58:31.175
That sounds like a plan.

58:32.176 --> 58:34.803
You can take one of these

58:32.176 --> 58:34.803
in an hour, okay?

59:42.830 --> 59:45.458
-Of course, yeah.

59:45.582 --> 59:46.625
Can you hold that?

59:54.883 --> 01:00:00.348
OK, it takes about 20 minutes.

-Yeah.

It's a cheap door.

I mean, we can break it,

01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:06.038
but if we do, we can't

01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:06.038

Serious crime.

01:02:28.329 --> 01:02:30.331

01:03:33.602 --> 01:03:35.354

I'll make this

01:05:13.327 --> 01:05:14.578
as quick as I can.

I'll send it to my Dad.

01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:07.339
There is not much hard evidence

of a direct crime

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:09.132

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:09.132
to be concerned about.

-Paul!

01:06:18.392 --> 01:06:20.018
-There's a restraining order.

01:06:18.392 --> 01:06:20.018
-Yeah, well, then they can

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:21.854
-arrest both of us.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:21.854
-Paul!

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:00.475
[dramatic music]

01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:21.204
Hey, baby.

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.875
Jane is not there, is she?

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.875
Great.

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:27.586
Listen I just had

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:27.586
some amazing news.

01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:30.005
So, why don't you

01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:30.005
plug up the hot tub

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:33.675
pull out a bottle of the good

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:33.675
stuff, make sure Tilly is

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:33.675
watching a movie.

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:35.761
I'll be right there.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:40.891
Absolutely.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:40.891
I love you too.

01:07:41.809 --> 01:07:42.935
[kissing sound]

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:47.648
[dramatic music]

01:08:13.674 --> 01:08:14.800
Hi, Till.

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:16.551
Hey.

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:18.470
Guess what?

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:20.848
I just convinced your mom,

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:20.848
finally,

01:08:20.973 --> 01:08:22.557
to let you take

01:08:20.973 --> 01:08:22.557
a ride in my car.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:24.768
It's not too dangerous?

01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:27.729
Of course it is, sweetie.

01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:27.729
That's what makes it

01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:27.729
so much fun.

01:08:28.063 --> 01:08:29.606
Come on. Let's go.

01:08:28.063 --> 01:08:29.606
Leave your tablet.

01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:31.149
-Yeah!

01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:31.149
-Yeah.

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:33.652
Alright. Lead the way.

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:37.238
In you go.

01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:40.033
Don't forget to buckle up.

01:08:41.535 --> 01:08:43.996
Stay here a moment. I'm gonna

01:08:41.535 --> 01:08:43.996
say bye to your mom, OK?

01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:45.372
-OK.

01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:45.372
-OK.

01:08:51.545 --> 01:08:52.671
[door slides open]

01:08:55.215 --> 01:08:56.131
So...

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:57.591
What's the good news?

01:08:58.051 --> 01:09:00.095
Some very exciting

01:08:58.051 --> 01:09:00.095
investments have matured.

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:05.017
Looks like this guy is coming

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:05.017
to some serious quit-his-job

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:05.017
kind of money.

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:06.600
-Oh.

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:06.600
-Yeah.

01:09:15.944 --> 01:09:18.029
-That's amazing.

01:09:15.944 --> 01:09:18.029
-I know, right?

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:22.076
Now we can get Jane

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:22.076
the best--

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.243
[smack]

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:31.376
Daddy!

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.462
Sam!

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:37.674
Jane, Tilly!

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:41.053
Sam!

01:09:43.638 --> 01:09:44.639
Oh, God!

01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:53.231
Listen. Hold on.

01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:53.231
I've got you.

01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:55.442
[Brian sighs]

01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:58.319
-My Daddy is here.

01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:58.319
-I know.

01:09:58.904 --> 01:10:01.281
He wants to talk to your mom

01:09:58.904 --> 01:10:01.281
alone, so we can go for a ride.

01:10:01.907 --> 01:10:04.200
-Cool? Yeah.

01:10:01.907 --> 01:10:04.200
-Yeah.

01:10:11.959 --> 01:10:14.628
One, two, three...

01:10:17.965 --> 01:10:19.174
[phone rings]

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:21.843
It's Brian.

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:21.843
Should I answer?

01:10:21.969 --> 01:10:22.761
[phone keeps ringing]

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:23.929
Huh?

01:10:25.931 --> 01:10:27.515
-Hi, Brian, what's up?

01:10:25.931 --> 01:10:27.515
-Not much.

01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:29.810
You are not with the police,

01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:29.810
are you?

01:10:30.978 --> 01:10:34.148
-What are you talking about?

01:10:30.978 --> 01:10:34.148
-I don't have time to play

01:10:30.978 --> 01:10:34.148
games, Jane.

01:10:34.648 --> 01:10:36.566
I want my jewelry

01:10:34.648 --> 01:10:36.566
and belongings back.

01:10:37.025 --> 01:10:38.152
And in exchange...

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.112
I'm willing to return

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.112
your sister to you

01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:41.655
completely unharmed.

01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:45.575
-Say hi to Jane, Till.

01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:45.575
-Hi, Jane!

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:49.079
Oh, don't worry.

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:49.079
She has absolutely no idea

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:49.079
what's going on.

01:10:49.204 --> 01:10:50.122
Now.

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:52.124
As your only family member

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:54.584
I assume her safety is

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:54.584
your top priority.

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:56.044
Wait. Only...

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:56.044
What did you do?

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:57.295
I didn't do anything.

01:10:57.796 --> 01:10:59.173
Your father showed up

01:10:57.796 --> 01:10:59.173
at the house and

01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:00.757
started screaming

01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:00.757
at your mother.

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.051
Looks like it turned violent,

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.051
something about

01:11:03.177 --> 01:11:04.928
a lot of money

01:11:03.177 --> 01:11:04.928
lost in bad investments.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:06.805
That was money that you stole.

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.640
Even if that were true

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.640
I imagine

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:10.391
it would be nearly

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:10.391
impossible to prove.

01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:12.019
Well I bet those jewels

01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:12.019
and photos I took

01:11:12.144 --> 01:11:13.687
they'd prove something,

01:11:12.144 --> 01:11:13.687
wouldn't they?

01:11:13.812 --> 01:11:15.189
I bet the police

01:11:13.812 --> 01:11:15.189
would love to see them.

01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:17.858
Maybe, but I think you're

01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:17.858
missing the point here, Jane.

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:21.402
I'm gonna drive her

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:21.402
to a secure location.

01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:23.738
I will then telephone you

01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:23.738
from a public place.

01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:26.741
Once you have relinquished all

01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:26.741
my property and I got

01:11:26.867 --> 01:11:29.744
far enough away so that

01:11:26.867 --> 01:11:29.744
I'm sure you didn't notify

01:11:26.867 --> 01:11:29.744
the authorities

01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:33.165
I promise I'll call you back

01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:33.165
and tell you where Till is.

01:11:33.498 --> 01:11:36.417
-How can I trust you?

01:11:33.498 --> 01:11:36.417
-I'm not asking you to trust me.

01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:39.671
I'm telling you what to do

01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:39.671
if you wanna see

01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:39.671
your sister alive again.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:46.970
Sorry about that.

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:51.599
-You all set?

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:51.599
-Uh-huh.

01:11:51.725 --> 01:11:56.980
Alright. Buckle up.

01:11:51.725 --> 01:11:56.980
Good girl, safety first, right?

01:11:57.105 --> 01:11:58.606
[Karli] We need

01:11:57.105 --> 01:11:58.606
to call the cops.

01:11:58.899 --> 01:12:01.359
We can't do that, Karli.

01:11:58.899 --> 01:12:01.359
He's going to kill her.

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:02.986
What else can we do?

01:12:04.738 --> 01:12:06.156
Wait, wait...

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:07.866
Wait, your watch.

01:12:09.076 --> 01:12:11.619
-Can't you still track him

01:12:09.076 --> 01:12:11.619
using your watch?

01:12:09.076 --> 01:12:11.619
-Oh my God, check it.

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:16.291
There he is. We need to get on

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:16.291
the highway and go north.

01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:17.209
Right now.

[engine starts]

01:12:41.066 --> 01:12:43.818
-Wow, it's huge.

01:12:41.066 --> 01:12:43.818
-Hm.

01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:48.323
-It's pretty cool, isn't it?

01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:48.323
-So cool.

01:12:57.249 --> 01:13:00.252
-Do wizards live here?

01:12:57.249 --> 01:13:00.252
-They could.

01:13:02.296 --> 01:13:05.340
Hey, I'll race you upstairs. Go!

01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:12.889
-I win.

01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:12.889
-Yeah.

Wanna see something cool?

01:13:17.978 --> 01:13:20.480
Let's go.

01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:47.215
Hey, Till, what's that over

01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:47.215
there? You see that?

01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:01.479

01:14:04.358 --> 01:14:05.400

Brian?

01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:12.324
Brian, let me out!

01:14:13.533 --> 01:14:16.577
[Till] <i> Brian, why are you doing</i>

01:14:13.533 --> 01:14:16.577
<i>this? I'm scared.</i>

01:14:20.207 --> 01:14:22.083
-[Jane] Stop, OK?

01:14:20.207 --> 01:14:22.083
-[Karli] OK.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.296
The map says he's here.

01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:29.424
-Ok, great, so now we call

01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:29.424
the cops.

01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:29.424
-No, not yet.

01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:31.592
He's gonna call me

01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:31.592
and wanna meet up, right?

01:14:32.219 --> 01:14:36.306
So, we wait until he leaves and

01:14:32.219 --> 01:14:36.306
then once Till is safe

01:14:37.182 --> 01:14:39.434
we have the cops meet him

01:14:37.182 --> 01:14:39.434
wherever he wants to meet me.

01:14:41.269 --> 01:14:42.854
OK, what do I do?

01:14:43.897 --> 01:14:47.359
Drive away, but stay close.

01:14:43.897 --> 01:14:47.359
Once he's gone you're

01:14:43.897 --> 01:14:47.359
gonna come and pick us up.

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:49.277
-Jane, are you sure?

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:49.277
-Yes.

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:52.322
