27:40.241 --> 27:41.785
Let's start with Plato.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.003
[Veronica's dad] Hey!

27:54.381 --> 27:55.757
Where you been, Kid Wonder?

27:56.049 --> 27:59.260
Tutoring. A bad student
and an even worse person.

28:00.887 --> 28:03.223
"Reeling" and "writhing," of course,
to begin with...

28:03.932 --> 28:06.267
and then the different branches
of arithmetic:

28:06.351 --> 28:08.728
ambition, distraction, uglification,
and derision.

28:09.771 --> 28:10.605
Lewis Carroll.

28:10.689 --> 28:11.523
Good.

28:11.981 --> 28:13.441
How goes the latest opus?

28:13.525 --> 28:15.151
Almost all opused.

28:16.611 --> 28:18.238
How's the poem coming for class?

28:21.741 --> 28:22.867
It's good.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.913
-When can I read it?
-When it's ready.

28:27.622 --> 28:29.999
Still iambisizing the iambic pentameter.

28:30.375 --> 28:33.253
You know the hardest part of being
a writer, still?

28:34.754 --> 28:35.630
The first read.

28:36.297 --> 28:38.383
Allowing yourself to be that vulnerable.

28:39.509 --> 28:42.345
Who makes and illustrates the way it is?

28:42.679 --> 28:45.348
The book whose words and pictures
never fade?

28:45.932 --> 28:48.268
Who writes the same edition
for every decade,

28:48.768 --> 28:53.857
plagiarizing and disguising the same
old story under the cover of change?

28:53.940 --> 28:54.858
Chapter Two,

28:55.608 --> 28:58.236
you better claim a shape or they'll name
one for you.

28:58.361 --> 29:01.781
Gay, straight, black, white,
are you the type of girl

29:01.865 --> 29:03.950
who's a friend, a fling, or a wife?

29:04.033 --> 29:06.870
Check the boxes that apply and don't think
your way outside.

29:06.953 --> 29:10.999
Replace your legs with pegs and
dig a hole to spend your remaining days

29:11.082 --> 29:13.543
fitting inside, 'cause that's when you're
living it right.

29:13.626 --> 29:16.880
At least three feet deep and
taking shallow breaths at best,

29:16.963 --> 29:20.425
because you air isn't your own,
and you're heir to your own life.

29:21.509 --> 29:23.511
[students applaud, cheer]

29:30.727 --> 29:34.606
The gauntlet has been thrown,
and the bar's set high.

29:35.106 --> 29:38.026
So for all you little Robbie Frosties,

29:38.109 --> 29:39.736
I hope this will be a challenge.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.913
I've been thinking about what you said,

29:49.996 --> 29:52.040
and I was wondering if you had
any suggestions

29:52.123 --> 29:53.875
on how to bolster my resume.

29:54.667 --> 29:56.002
What languages do you speak?

29:56.085 --> 29:58.379
French, Italian, and a little Mandarin.

29:58.505 --> 30:00.965
[counselor] Mandarin? You know
how many people speak Mandarin?

30:01.049 --> 30:02.926
About a billion Chinese.

30:03.009 --> 30:04.594
You're not getting it, Sierra.

30:04.677 --> 30:05.970
Think different.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.557
Bet Dad never gets writer's block.

30:12.852 --> 30:13.686
Okay.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.838
[Sierra] Plato believed
that physical beauty was both a form

30:39.921 --> 30:41.965
-and a sensory experience.
-[children humming]

30:42.048 --> 30:42.882
Stop!

30:43.675 --> 30:47.554
Physical beauty facilitates
platonic recollection.

30:47.637 --> 30:49.931
-Reco-what?
-Recollection.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.145
Are you sure you don't have any
real food in this house?

30:56.229 --> 30:58.731
[Veronica's mom]
No. You don't eat junk at your age.

30:59.315 --> 31:01.901
You'll make lifelong fat cells
that'll ride your hips

31:01.985 --> 31:03.528
like a cowboy rides a buckin' bronco.

31:03.611 --> 31:04.988
[Veronica's mom to girls] No, stop.

31:05.071 --> 31:06.739
-Mom.
-And then what?

31:07.657 --> 31:08.658
Okay...

31:09.409 --> 31:10.952
well, Plato was kind of a jerk,

31:11.035 --> 31:12.871
but in his more optimistic moments,

31:12.954 --> 31:15.248
he revered beauty for revealing
the mysteries of the soul.

31:15.915 --> 31:18.585
Your father was a mystery.
Until the day he died of his heart attack.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.880
Thought he died in a plane crash.

31:21.963 --> 31:24.591
Is there, like, a For Dummies version
of the For Dummies version,

31:24.674 --> 31:26.134
because I'm not understanding this.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.385
Moronica!

31:28.845 --> 31:30.930
Moronica!

31:31.848 --> 31:34.976
-So, Plato...
-The butt sex guy?

31:36.769 --> 31:37.979
-Right?
-No...

31:38.062 --> 31:39.856
I mean he was from ancient Greece,

31:39.939 --> 31:41.983
but so were Aristotle and Socrates.

31:42.275 --> 31:44.527
Wait, wait, they're not all the same guy?

31:44.611 --> 31:45.945
Moronica!

31:46.029 --> 31:47.780
-[dog barking]
-Moronica!

31:50.033 --> 31:51.868
Oh, you're not kidding?

31:51.951 --> 31:53.912
No, no, I thought we already covered--

31:53.995 --> 31:55.622
Can you stop doing that, Brody!

31:55.705 --> 31:57.332
[Veronica's mom] Girls, shh.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.584
They're studying, okay?

32:00.501 --> 32:01.669
I'll never get this.

32:03.046 --> 32:05.214
Moronica!

32:05.298 --> 32:08.760
Girls! I'm counting to five. One...

32:08.843 --> 32:10.970
two... now, upstairs.

32:12.680 --> 32:13.765
I can't.

32:24.025 --> 32:24.901
Veronica.

32:28.071 --> 32:28.947
It's pointless.

32:30.114 --> 32:31.240
I mean, they're right.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.117
I'm "Moronica."

32:38.539 --> 32:40.625
Look, you're not a moron, okay?

32:40.875 --> 32:42.961
You think of some seriously mean crap.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.673
You've gotta have something upstairs
to think of those insults.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.095
Yeah.

32:54.055 --> 32:54.889
Nevermind.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.228
So, this...

33:00.812 --> 33:02.188
this Jamey I'm dating...

33:03.398 --> 33:04.524
have you sext him yet?

33:06.192 --> 33:07.819
We can send him a nude if you want.

33:07.902 --> 33:08.820
No.

33:10.571 --> 33:11.948
No, Jamey is not like that.

33:12.031 --> 33:13.449
Everyone is like that.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.537
If you want to start off JV...

33:18.746 --> 33:20.456
-What?
-Your phone.

33:22.625 --> 33:23.793
Give me your phone.

34:04.375 --> 34:05.543
You should send those.

34:06.919 --> 34:09.130
If you're gonna pretend to be me,
be normal,

34:10.256 --> 34:11.674
or you could just die alone.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.195
[phone chimes]

34:39.702 --> 34:41.370
Oh, shit.

35:00.098 --> 35:00.932
[phone chimes]

35:05.144 --> 35:06.104
[quietly] Yeah.

35:48.229 --> 35:50.231
[phone rings]

35:56.654 --> 35:57.655
Yo!

35:59.824 --> 36:00.700
Hey!

36:11.544 --> 36:12.461
Bonsoir!

36:13.129 --> 36:16.465
Bonsoir, Mademoiselle.

36:16.549 --> 36:17.884
Good day, fair maiden.

36:18.134 --> 36:21.262
What soft light through yonder window...

36:21.345 --> 36:24.724
we're still doing old timey stuff, right?

36:24.974 --> 36:26.517
Yeah, totally.

36:27.727 --> 36:30.563
I'm just super-glad that you picked up

36:30.646 --> 36:31.564
because if you hadn't,

36:31.647 --> 36:33.524
then I would have had to, like,

36:33.608 --> 36:35.026
come up with some sort of

36:35.109 --> 36:37.486
hilarious voicemail to impress you,

36:37.570 --> 36:40.990
and that would have been
super-terrible for both of us, you know?

36:41.073 --> 36:44.702
No, don't you hate that pressure?

36:45.494 --> 36:48.873
It's kinda… it's kinda interesting.
Your voice sounds different

36:49.123 --> 36:50.666
than I remember it.

36:51.667 --> 36:52.543
Oh, yeah.

36:52.627 --> 36:56.005
I have a cold, so it's kinda mannish.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.882
Oh, sorry.

36:59.091 --> 37:01.594
That's sucks, though, 'cause I
kinda like it, you know.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.888
Maybe you should just get sick more often

37:03.971 --> 37:05.223
and then I'll be happy.

37:05.514 --> 37:08.059
Oh, okay, because you're what,
super into dudes?

37:08.142 --> 37:10.144
Whoa, whoa. [laughs]

37:10.228 --> 37:12.563
That's just--
I mean, we are the superior sex.

37:12.688 --> 37:14.148
Oh, yeah.

37:14.232 --> 37:18.486
No, your voice, it's not loud
or anything,

37:18.569 --> 37:20.988
it's like more fuller...

37:22.156 --> 37:23.157
maybe.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.159
You calling my voice fat right now?

37:25.243 --> 37:28.579
-No, no...
-Is that what's happening?

37:28.788 --> 37:30.748
Oh, my God! No, no, no.

37:30.831 --> 37:34.794
I would never do that because I was,
like, a super-fat baby.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.507
-Why would I... I have no idea why?
-You were a fat baby?

37:39.882 --> 37:41.968
Yeah, I was like the Michelin man.

37:42.760 --> 37:46.180
No, don't stop. I like hearing about
what's wrong with you.

37:46.597 --> 37:49.225
No, I'm sorry. That was my only flaw.

37:49.308 --> 37:50.726
I would totally tell you more.

37:50.810 --> 37:53.354
That was my one and only flaw,

37:53.437 --> 37:56.983
and you somehow got it out of me,
so thank you very much for that.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.527
Actually, no, I lied.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.946
I totally just lied to you.
I do have one more,

38:02.238 --> 38:06.951
and it's that I have these
glow in the dark stickers

38:07.034 --> 38:09.620
on my ceiling that have been there
for the past ten years.

38:10.079 --> 38:12.456
But besides that, I'm perfect, basically.

38:12.540 --> 38:13.958
What about you?

38:14.417 --> 38:17.753
You got any dark secrets I should
know about?

38:20.881 --> 38:24.302
None immediately come to mind.

38:25.386 --> 38:28.180
What about, like, secret talents?

38:29.348 --> 38:31.392
-Sandwiches?
-I love sandwiches.

38:31.892 --> 38:33.894
What's your favorite movie?

38:34.812 --> 38:36.147
Probably Die Hard.

38:36.272 --> 38:37.773
-Really?
-No, that's a complete lie.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.108
Just trying to be manly for you.

38:41.360 --> 38:44.363
-What kinda animal would you be?
-[Jamey] I think I'd be a bear,

38:44.447 --> 38:49.035
because they're like, super-cuddly
but also really bad-ass,

38:49.160 --> 38:51.037
you know, double-sided like that.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.165
So what's your double side, then?

38:54.248 --> 38:55.875
Are you more than just a hot jock?

38:55.958 --> 38:57.126
Oh, you think I'm hot?

38:57.877 --> 38:58.753
No.

38:59.503 --> 39:03.966
To answer your question, I don't really
consider myself a jock.

39:05.134 --> 39:07.803
I mean, yeah, I like football,

39:07.887 --> 39:10.806
but between you and me, I don't even like
most of the guys on my team.

39:10.890 --> 39:15.311
I love football 'cause every game
is like a story.

39:16.729 --> 39:19.732
For a few hours there are villains
and there are heroes.

39:19.815 --> 39:23.736
Every pass is a triumph,
every tackle is a tragedy.

39:23.819 --> 39:27.198
You're all hurtling downfield at this
one epic goal

39:27.281 --> 39:30.701
and every second matters.
It's electric, you know.

39:30.868 --> 39:33.245
It's like poetry...

39:34.121 --> 39:35.373
to me, at least

39:38.125 --> 39:40.336
I can't go telling
the rest of the team that.

39:41.504 --> 39:42.671
They'd be freaking out.

39:42.755 --> 39:46.300
I'm the quarterback,
so I got to keep their respect.

39:50.513 --> 39:53.015
So, what kind of flower would you be?

39:54.392 --> 39:56.936
Cactus. Does cactus count as a flower?

39:58.354 --> 40:00.856
I don't think those qualify
as flowers, no.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.149
You'd be a rose.

40:03.359 --> 40:07.196
Like the queen flower
all the other flowers are jealous of.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.285
Sorry, I guess it's kinda late.

40:14.161 --> 40:15.496
After four hours on the phone,

40:15.579 --> 40:17.373
I can pick your voice out of a line-up.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.837
Do you wanna FaceTime tomorrow?

40:22.920 --> 40:26.966
I mean, it would be nice to see you,
you know.

40:28.300 --> 40:29.927
Would it really, though?

40:31.929 --> 40:34.598
Well, maybe more for me than for you.

40:35.724 --> 40:37.685
No, no, I just...

40:38.811 --> 40:43.983
I mean, yeah, there's no reason why
I shouldn't logically,

40:44.150 --> 40:47.236
so yeah. Yes, yeah.

40:48.154 --> 40:54.326
Okay, great. Well, then, logically
I can't wait.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.621
-Goodnight, Veronica.
-Goodnight.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.670
Oh, crap.

41:05.588 --> 41:07.465
Where are the Sour Patch parents?

41:07.923 --> 41:09.800
I have no idea how we're gonna do this.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.719
Oh, 'cause we shouldn't.
It's a really bad plan.

41:12.219 --> 41:14.847
-Vietnam sounds like a better plan.
-Okay.

41:15.097 --> 41:16.432
Internment camps,

41:16.974 --> 41:18.976
waterboarding, boy bands...

41:19.477 --> 41:21.479
Hammer pants would even be better.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.608
Are you really buying your own ticket
to homecoming?

41:25.774 --> 41:27.318
Like anyone's asking me?

41:27.902 --> 41:29.069
Well, I'll go with you.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.864
I really don't care who I go with,
so it's all good.

41:31.947 --> 41:34.158
Thanks, but I think I'll pass
on the pity date.

41:34.241 --> 41:35.743
What, it's not a pity date.

41:36.827 --> 41:38.787
You're wearing a lot less crap
on your face.

41:38.871 --> 41:39.997
Thank you.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.415
-Veronica, are you sick?
-Yeah.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.167
No, it's a good thing.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.169
-Here.
-Thank you.

41:45.544 --> 41:46.378
Bye.

41:49.131 --> 41:50.466
[Dan] That wasn't weird.

41:51.133 --> 41:54.261
-Where you going? We have free period.
-Talk to Coach about trying out for track.

41:56.931 --> 41:59.308
You know the girls' team is like,
last in the state, right?

41:59.391 --> 42:02.436
I know. I'm trying out for the boys' team.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.562
Oh, shit.

42:03.979 --> 42:06.023
-Okay.
-Okay.

42:06.106 --> 42:09.151
I need something that's gonna stand out
on my resume.

42:09.568 --> 42:12.947
You know?
I need to be like, Susan B. Anthony,

42:13.364 --> 42:15.616
standing up for women's rights,
going against the grain.

42:15.699 --> 42:16.659
Susan B.!

42:17.952 --> 42:20.579

55:09.597 --> 55:11.016
I'm going to end it tonight.

55:11.766 --> 55:12.600
Okay.

55:13.935 --> 55:14.769
All right.

55:15.812 --> 55:17.480
I'm not going to say nothing.

55:17.564 --> 55:19.232
[engine splutters]

55:19.816 --> 55:21.818
-Show him that sexy face.
-Okay.

55:37.584 --> 55:38.668
Sorry, buddy.

55:41.129 --> 55:42.297
Okay.

55:45.342 --> 55:46.801
Hey, sorry.

55:46.885 --> 55:48.636
-I didn't mean to scare you.
-No.

55:50.305 --> 55:51.765
Did you order?

55:52.474 --> 55:53.600
Just a popcorn.

55:58.730 --> 56:00.815
Sorry, I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.

56:00.899 --> 56:02.359
-Okay. Yeah, yeah.
-Okay?

56:04.235 --> 56:05.111
I can't do it.

56:05.528 --> 56:08.406
What happened to
"You owe him the truth, no matter what?"

56:08.490 --> 56:09.532
I'm just not ready.

56:13.036 --> 56:15.205
Just don't kiss him, okay?

56:15.288 --> 56:16.122
Eww.

56:30.553 --> 56:31.554
Hi, cookie.

56:31.971 --> 56:34.724
Alright. Rashi, Toph.

56:40.480 --> 56:41.898
-That's good.
-I know, right?

56:42.023 --> 56:44.818
Popcorn? Okay.
-I'm okay, thanks.

56:45.944 --> 56:49.531
It's funny, your voice sounds
skinny again.

56:50.323 --> 56:51.282
You feeling better?

56:51.866 --> 56:52.700
What?

56:53.034 --> 56:53.910
What do you mean?

56:54.744 --> 56:55.662
Like...

56:56.287 --> 56:59.124
Like on the phone, when I was like,
"Oh, your voice was full,"

56:59.207 --> 57:03.002
you're like, "You calling my voice fat?"
And I was like, "No."

57:03.628 --> 57:05.088
-No.
-You don't remember?

57:05.672 --> 57:07.924
-It was late.
-Oh, my God, no!

57:08.049 --> 57:09.134
Sorry.

57:09.843 --> 57:11.344
Ronnie, what are we doing here?

57:11.803 --> 57:13.346
I thought you were trying to get Spence.

57:13.430 --> 57:14.431
-Spence?
-Spence?

57:15.098 --> 57:16.349
No one. He's no one.

57:16.474 --> 57:19.185
He's just some guy I dated forever ago.

57:19.269 --> 57:20.937
I kissed a boy called Spence once.

57:21.020 --> 57:22.313
A real wanker, actually.

57:22.730 --> 57:23.982
Probably the same Spence.

57:24.065 --> 57:25.316
[movie starts]

57:25.400 --> 57:27.277
Have you ever counted shoulders before?

57:28.027 --> 57:30.864
One, two, three, four.

57:57.223 --> 57:59.058
[Jamey] What, you got
a curfew or something?

58:01.603 --> 58:03.771
[Jamey] Why didn't you...
Was the movie that bad?

58:15.617 --> 58:16.993
You look so cold right now.

58:17.076 --> 58:18.661
I'm going to get you a jacket, okay.

58:25.168 --> 58:26.002
[door closes]

58:27.754 --> 58:29.172
[Jamey] Here you go.

58:31.174 --> 58:32.008
Thanks.

58:35.762 --> 58:36.679
You like stars?

58:39.224 --> 58:40.099
[Veronica] Yeah.

58:40.225 --> 58:42.435
[Jamey] I'm kind of obsessed
with astronomy.

58:43.311 --> 58:45.813
-[Veronica] Nerd. Why?
-Nerd?

58:47.232 --> 58:49.776
[Jamey] Well, because...

58:50.235 --> 58:51.694
we look at them from down here

58:51.778 --> 58:53.821
-and they look so beautiful and shiny.
-[phone buzzes]

58:55.031 --> 58:57.075
They're actually just made up of hydrogen,

58:57.450 --> 58:59.994
which means that they're just
massive balls of gas

59:00.078 --> 59:01.996
floating through space and I think
it's trippy.

59:05.917 --> 59:07.794
Change of perspective, you know.

59:09.712 --> 59:11.881
I wonder if a star knows that it shuns.

59:13.341 --> 59:14.300
Shines.

59:17.220 --> 59:20.557
-If a star knows that it shines.
-Yeah, I never thought of that.

59:24.936 --> 59:26.896
Do you know what you wanna be
when you grow up?

59:37.865 --> 59:39.200
It was a stupid question.

59:47.584 --> 59:48.751
Should be a singer.

59:49.919 --> 59:51.004
I should be a singer?

59:51.921 --> 59:54.716
-Oh, no, not you.
-Oh, you should be a singer?

59:54.841 --> 59:57.176
-No, no, no, not me!
-You should sing for me.

59:57.260 --> 59:59.887
-I can't sing. It was obviously a joke.
-Wait, alright, hold on.

1:00:00.013 --> 1:00:02.140
You want to be a singer, but you don't
know how to sing.

1:00:02.724 --> 1:00:04.225
-It was a joke?
-It was a joke.

1:00:04.309 --> 1:00:05.518
[Veronica laughs]

1:00:05.602 --> 1:00:06.436
[dryly] Ah, ha, ha.

1:00:08.730 --> 1:00:11.232
I haven't really thought about life
after high school,

1:00:11.316 --> 1:00:12.358
I've got to be honest.

1:00:13.526 --> 1:00:14.485
Until I met Sierra.

1:00:16.029 --> 1:00:18.406
I literally just met a Sierra.

1:00:18.489 --> 1:00:19.616
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:00:20.950 --> 1:00:22.744
You'd really like my Sierra.

1:00:23.244 --> 1:00:25.830
Not at first. You'd think she was like,
a loser, you know.

1:00:25.913 --> 1:00:27.540
Well, so are we, right?

1:00:28.333 --> 1:00:30.710
Yeah, sure I'm a quarterback

1:00:30.793 --> 1:00:32.086
and you're a cheerleader, but...

1:00:33.212 --> 1:00:34.547
under all that, you are...

1:00:35.757 --> 1:00:36.674
so different.

1:00:44.515 --> 1:00:46.017
[gasps] Oh, my God!

1:00:46.100 --> 1:00:47.602
-What, are you okay?
-Yes.

1:00:47.685 --> 1:00:49.437
-What...
-Yes, I...

1:00:50.355 --> 1:00:53.024
-I got really excited.
-So you just jumped?

1:00:53.107 --> 1:00:53.983
Yes.

1:00:54.776 --> 1:00:57.987
Is that gonna happen every time
I try to kiss you, you're gonna jump?

1:00:59.238 --> 1:01:00.615
Would you close your eyes?

1:01:01.449 --> 1:01:03.493
Because I have really big pores.

1:01:04.285 --> 1:01:06.621
-So can you close your eyes?
-I have big pores.

1:01:06.788 --> 1:01:08.956
-Can you close them?
-You want me to close my eyes,

1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:11.834
-my eyes are closed.
-Yes. And keep them closed.

1:01:11.918 --> 1:01:15.254
My eyes are gonna stay closed
until you give me other orders.

1:01:16.923 --> 1:01:17.757
What are you doing?

1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:19.342
Are you, like, abandoning me?

1:01:19.425 --> 1:01:20.718
I'm right here.

1:01:22.136 --> 1:01:23.262
Sorry.

1:01:24.389 --> 1:01:26.391
[both silently mouthing]

1:01:28.643 --> 1:01:29.477
[chuckles]

1:01:32.939 --> 1:01:34.524
Well, it was worth the wait.

1:01:36.025 --> 1:01:38.027
It's weird, we talked so much on the phone

1:01:38.111 --> 1:01:42.115
it actually feels, like, more normal
when I can't see you.

1:02:03.177 --> 1:02:05.304
Keep them closed! I said keep them closed.

1:02:05.888 --> 1:02:07.306
Okay, they are closed.

1:02:07.598 --> 1:02:09.475
Veronica, this is ridiculous.

1:02:09.559 --> 1:02:11.102
Veronica, I just want to see you.

1:02:11.185 --> 1:02:12.603
Well, see me now.

1:02:14.856 --> 1:02:17.400
You wanted to see me,
now you're not even looking.

1:02:17.525 --> 1:02:21.779
-Well, yeah, but I thought I saw some...
-What, you saw... what?

1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:25.783
You're acting so weird right now.

1:02:28.202 --> 1:02:30.997
[Jamey] Am I gonna have to go through that
every time I try to kiss you?

1:02:31.664 --> 1:02:34.917
If you're crazy, that's just something
that I need to know about

1:02:35.042 --> 1:02:37.170
-before I take you on a second date.
-I'll let you know.

1:02:44.719 --> 1:02:46.095
[Sierra] It was incredible.

1:02:48.055 --> 1:02:50.141
The kind of kiss you read about in books,

1:02:50.224 --> 1:02:51.893
but never believe could happen.

1:02:53.728 --> 1:02:54.562
Mm-hmm.

1:02:56.355 --> 1:02:59.108
You wanna hang out and go over
our debate platform?

1:03:00.026 --> 1:03:00.860
Yeah, maybe.

1:03:00.943 --> 1:03:03.362
I'm just kind of swamped
with college stuff right now.

1:03:04.363 --> 1:03:05.615
Yeah, yeah.

1:03:09.702 --> 1:03:10.536
Sorry.

1:03:12.288 --> 1:03:13.790
Why do people do this to themselves?

1:03:13.998 --> 1:03:15.249
Because it looks pretty.

1:03:15.750 --> 1:03:17.126
And they're almost even.

1:03:19.504 --> 1:03:20.922
Your mom's really pretty.

1:03:21.255 --> 1:03:23.007
You should see her prom pictures.

1:03:23.633 --> 1:03:26.385
The night of, or the morning after?

1:03:26.511 --> 1:03:30.014
-No, I do not need to think about that.
-Sorry. I'm sorry.

1:03:32.934 --> 1:03:34.143
Can I ask you something?

1:03:34.227 --> 1:03:36.479
I'm not gonna les out with you
and Jamie.

1:03:37.647 --> 1:03:39.524
-No, no.
-I only do that at parties.

1:03:40.066 --> 1:03:41.818
Why does everybody think I'm a lesbian?

1:03:43.069 --> 1:03:44.070
No, I...

1:03:44.821 --> 1:03:48.908
I wanted to ask, what's up with your mom?

1:03:50.159 --> 1:03:51.953
What-- What happened to your dad?

1:03:52.995 --> 1:03:53.913
He...

1:03:55.039 --> 1:03:57.250
he left her for a 22-year-old.

1:03:57.959 --> 1:04:02.547
And left us with all this crap
and furniture and...

1:04:03.130 --> 1:04:05.383
no way to pay for our old house, and...

1:04:06.342 --> 1:04:09.220
she's just been weird about this
whole fading youth stuff ever since.

1:04:12.306 --> 1:04:13.182
I'm sorry.

1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:16.978
I should probably get ready.

1:04:18.813 --> 1:04:19.939
I'm going to a party.

1:04:21.732 --> 1:04:22.775
Do you want to come?

1:04:24.485 --> 1:04:26.195
Like, together?

1:04:26.988 --> 1:04:27.864
In public?

1:04:29.532 --> 1:04:30.449
Yeah.

1:04:34.662 --> 1:04:35.496
Sierra.

1:04:35.913 --> 1:04:37.957
You are so tense right now.

1:04:38.082 --> 1:04:40.001
-Smile.
-Calm down.

1:04:40.084 --> 1:04:41.669
-It's a party.
-I know.

1:04:42.044 --> 1:04:44.046
-That's what's so terrifying.
-No!

1:04:44.714 --> 1:04:46.716
[overlapping chatter]

1:04:55.182 --> 1:04:57.351
-[Veronica] Hey, how's it going?
-Hey!

1:05:02.315 --> 1:05:03.274
Hey, Ronnie.

1:05:03.816 --> 1:05:05.026
I thought you were sick.

1:05:05.651 --> 1:05:08.029
Who's ready to get this bitch started?
Let's go!

1:05:08.321 --> 1:05:10.072
Sorry about that, ladies,
sorry about that.

1:05:11.866 --> 1:05:13.492
I need to talk to you... now.

1:05:14.368 --> 1:05:15.244
Sure.

1:05:15.703 --> 1:05:17.246
Like, alone, outside.

1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:20.625
Okay. Sure, let's go.

1:05:23.044 --> 1:05:24.128
I'll be right back.

1:05:48.486 --> 1:05:50.071
[phone chimes]

1:05:57.286 --> 1:05:58.579
You probably deserved it.

1:05:58.663 --> 1:06:00.539
Probably ditched your best friend too.

1:06:00.873 --> 1:06:01.749
[weight thuds]

1:06:02.917 --> 1:06:04.961
So what's the real story?

1:06:05.252 --> 1:06:07.088
[boy speaking Mandarin]

1:06:07.171 --> 1:06:08.631
Veronica... [speaking in Mandarin]

1:06:09.090 --> 1:06:11.050
Wow, everybody does speak Mandarin.

1:06:11.133 --> 1:06:13.761
-Come on wreck, keg stand, now. Let's go!
-What?

1:06:13.844 --> 1:06:15.054
You're gonna love it.

1:06:15.137 --> 1:06:16.764
[girl] You're such a drama queen now.

1:06:18.140 --> 1:06:19.266
She's not that bad.

1:06:19.892 --> 1:06:20.726
She's--

1:06:20.810 --> 1:06:22.603
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1:06:23.896 --> 1:06:25.439
She's actually kinda cool.

1:06:26.148 --> 1:06:27.817
Like, a totally unfortunate way.

1:06:28.067 --> 1:06:30.945
If you wanna commit social suicide, fine,

1:06:31.112 --> 1:06:33.280
but Sierra Burgess is a loser.

1:06:33.823 --> 1:06:34.991
Remember?

1:06:35.074 --> 1:06:37.493
Only losers hang out with losers.

1:06:42.581 --> 1:06:43.499
Mackenzie, wait.

1:06:43.582 --> 1:06:45.793
Yo, everyone in here! Everyone in here!

1:06:46.085 --> 1:06:47.962
[boys chanting] Chug, chug! Chug, chug!

1:06:48.045 --> 1:06:50.423
[boy] Come on, everybody
gather around! Watch this!

1:06:52.258 --> 1:06:54.885
Chug, chug! Chug, chug!

1:07:10.776 --> 1:07:11.610
[burps]

1:07:12.695 --> 1:07:13.612
Whoo!

1:07:18.868 --> 1:07:20.244
You tamed the beast!

1:07:20.453 --> 1:07:21.287
My turn.

1:07:21.454 --> 1:07:23.748
Come on, let's go. Get me up here.

1:07:26.125 --> 1:07:28.085
Chug, chug! Chug, chug!

1:07:30.671 --> 1:07:33.090
[boy] I told Veronica she's dumb
to make her insecure.

1:07:33.674 --> 1:07:36.052
I guarantee she puts out tonight.

1:07:38.429 --> 1:07:39.805
You're the master.

1:07:39.930 --> 1:07:41.307
I bow down to you, sir.

1:07:47.688 --> 1:07:48.522
Hi.

1:07:49.106 --> 1:07:50.483
I love your poodle.

1:07:53.152 --> 1:07:54.653
That's so adorable.

1:07:59.366 --> 1:08:00.326
Dick!

1:08:20.888 --> 1:08:22.181
Oh, my God! Jesus!

1:08:23.599 --> 1:08:24.475
Spence?

1:08:26.477 --> 1:08:27.728
What are you doing here?

1:08:29.313 --> 1:08:31.398
I saw your post and I had to see you.

1:08:32.608 --> 1:08:33.651
My Hamlet video?

1:08:34.068 --> 1:08:37.321
What? No, the one about this party.

1:08:40.116 --> 1:08:41.242
Do you wanna get out of here?

1:08:42.118 --> 1:08:44.912
This place is, like, crawling with dudes.

1:08:44.995 --> 1:08:46.705
I can't just ditch my friend.

1:08:49.125 --> 1:08:50.000
Come on.

1:08:52.878 --> 1:08:53.838
Go where?

1:08:53.921 --> 1:08:55.881
