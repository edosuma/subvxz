WEBVTT

00:08.138 --> 00:11.315
CONTROLLER: Contact
Potomac Approach on 335.5.

00:11.359 --> 00:13.752
Roger. Descend
and maintain 10,000,

00:13.796 --> 00:16.103
heading 2-7-0.

00:16.146 --> 00:20.455
Pushing approach 335.5.

00:20.498 --> 00:24.459
All right, Henry,
you have the aircraft.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.983
Roger that.
I have the aircraft.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.159
You want to try a break turn
to the right?

00:29.203 --> 00:30.856
Roger that.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.517
Great flying
with you, Squatch.You, too, Henry.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.606
Hey, what was your call
sign back in the day?

00:41.650 --> 00:43.652
[chuckles] "Prophet,"
which sounds kind of cool,

00:43.695 --> 00:46.133
but it was not given
for cool reasons, believe me.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.830
Yeah, they never are.

00:47.873 --> 00:50.398
Hairy feet,
hence "Squatch."

00:50.441 --> 00:52.400
But hey, anything beats
"Friggin' New Guy," right?Right.

00:52.443 --> 00:53.792
Hey, Congressman.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.403
Welcome back.Thanks.

00:55.446 --> 00:57.405
CHAMPLIN: My friends,
this is an exciting time.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.407
The prototype F-40 fighter,

00:59.450 --> 01:02.105
which some of you folks
have been lucky enough

01:02.149 --> 01:03.846
to take a ride in today

01:03.889 --> 01:07.154
is the future of our nation's
air defense.

01:07.197 --> 01:10.331
And thanks to the extraordinary
capabilities of the F-40,

01:10.374 --> 01:13.464
that future looks bright indeed.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.510
Thank you so much for coming.

01:15.553 --> 01:18.165
Now let's enjoy ourselves.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.648
You miss it, right?

01:23.692 --> 01:26.303
Oh, brother,
more than I want to admit.

01:26.347 --> 01:29.437
[chuckles] I can't
wait to get up there.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.656
Hey, how's the plane?

01:31.700 --> 01:34.224
Uh, you'll see.

01:34.268 --> 01:37.053
I mean, some stuff
is incredible.

01:37.097 --> 01:41.231
But, uh, in terms of actual
speed and maneuverability,

01:41.275 --> 01:43.886
eh, it's kind of a brick.

01:46.454 --> 01:49.370
Some part of that brick is being
manufactured in every district

01:49.413 --> 01:52.373
of every politician in this
place, including mine.

01:52.416 --> 01:56.594
So if he comes over here,
do a Marine brother a favor

01:56.638 --> 01:59.510
and smile, would you?

01:59.554 --> 02:02.165
Sure, Jeff.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.558
DALTON:
Bess.

02:03.601 --> 02:07.388
We're, uh, having an issue
with the F-40,

02:07.431 --> 02:09.781
and we could use your help.

02:09.825 --> 02:12.001
Well, I hope it isn't
too big of an issue,

02:12.044 --> 02:14.699
because Henry's flying in one
as we speak.

02:14.743 --> 02:15.874
BECKER:
Nothing like that.

02:15.918 --> 02:17.485
The F-40's an
excellent plane.

02:17.528 --> 02:19.139
[chuckles]: Oh, good.As you know,

02:19.182 --> 02:23.143
ten years ago, DOD placed an
initial order of 80 F-40s

02:23.186 --> 02:25.145
from their manufacturer
Fossor Industries.

02:29.453 --> 02:32.543
We just received Fossor's
latest budget estimate.

02:32.587 --> 02:35.111
In order to manufacture
the 80 planes and make it

02:35.155 --> 02:38.375
economically feasible during
the agreed-upon timeline,

02:38.419 --> 02:40.595
Fossor needs to make
an even hundred.

02:40.638 --> 02:44.164
And, uh, how much do
the extra 20 cost?

02:44.207 --> 02:45.687
$3.6 billion.

02:45.730 --> 02:48.690
Wow.

02:48.733 --> 02:51.562
We're really gonna
let them shake down

02:51.606 --> 02:52.955
the federal government
like that?

02:52.998 --> 02:54.913
No, I wouldn't
call it a shakedown.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.567
These types of cost overruns

02:56.611 --> 02:58.482
are a feature
of defense contracting.

02:58.526 --> 02:59.875
RUSSELL: Plus, the
different components

02:59.918 --> 03:02.182
of the F-40 are assembled in 40%

03:02.225 --> 03:05.272
of all congressional districts
nationwide.

03:05.315 --> 03:06.882
Which partly explains
the cost overruns,

03:06.925 --> 03:12.104
because logistically,
that makes absolutely no sense.

03:12.148 --> 03:14.498
But politically,
it makes all kinds of sense.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.718
They are the largest
defense contractor

03:16.761 --> 03:19.851
in the world,
so to answer your question,

03:19.895 --> 03:23.725
yes, we really are going to let
them shake us down like that.

03:23.768 --> 03:25.988
I-I wouldn't call it
a shakedown, sir.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.338
Where do I come in?

03:28.382 --> 03:30.166
RUSSELL: We need to find a home
for those extra 20 jets,

03:30.210 --> 03:33.300
somewhere among
our friends and allies.

03:33.343 --> 03:34.997
And we need to do it fast.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.260
BECKER: You are no doubt
aware of our pending sale

03:37.304 --> 03:40.132
of military equipment to Taiwan.

03:40.176 --> 03:42.309
We were thinking of adding
the F-40s to that package.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.702
DALTON: We need State to
perform an expedited review

03:44.746 --> 03:46.138
of the proposed sale.

03:46.182 --> 03:48.271
We need you to convince Taiwan
that buying the jets

03:48.315 --> 03:50.273
would be in their
strategic interest.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.928
All due respect, sir,

03:52.971 --> 03:58.325
it isn't in their strategic
interest, or ours.

03:58.368 --> 04:01.850
China's already angry about
the existing arms sale.

04:01.893 --> 04:04.374
It's pro forma posturing.
It happens every time.

04:04.418 --> 04:07.595
Sure, but you tack on
20 next-gen fighter jets

04:07.638 --> 04:09.249
that can reach
Beijing in an hour?

04:09.292 --> 04:11.207
Oh, closer
to an hour and a half.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.209
What, I...The F-40's a little logy.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.732
It's an excellent
plane, Russell.

04:14.776 --> 04:18.693
Regardless, China will see this
as a major provocation.

04:18.736 --> 04:21.261
Not only could
they respond militarily,

04:21.304 --> 04:23.437
but they could also pull out

04:23.480 --> 04:25.308
of the Fair Work
and Trade Agreement,

04:25.352 --> 04:27.397
which we are
this close to signing,

04:27.441 --> 04:31.009
and which will protect the
health and safety of literally

04:31.053 --> 04:32.881
millions of workers
around the world.

04:32.924 --> 04:36.276
The F-40 is the lynchpin of our
entire airborne military posture

04:36.319 --> 04:40.236
for decades to come,
so it has to come first.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.760
I understand, sir.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.198
I'll have my department

04:46.242 --> 04:49.376
do a top secret
feasibility review ASAP.

04:49.419 --> 04:54.250
But... of course, I-I can't
guarantee a specific outcome.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.252
We hear you, Bess.Totally get it.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.646
Huh.

04:58.689 --> 05:00.430
That'll be all.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.129
Mr. President.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.224
Matt.

05:12.268 --> 05:14.314
Whoa-- what? What?

05:14.357 --> 05:16.316
Here.
Okay.

05:16.359 --> 05:20.232
Waffles. Oh, buddy.

05:20.276 --> 05:23.148
You're in a little Waffles cone.

05:23.192 --> 05:24.367
It's not funny.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.413
Oh, it is a little funny.Not to me.

05:26.456 --> 05:27.936
Because I had to take him
to the 24-hour vet

05:27.979 --> 05:29.633
at 5:30 in the morning.

05:29.677 --> 05:32.332
Joanna threw a toy from her high
chair and scratched his cornea.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.290
What?
So for the next
three days at work,

05:34.334 --> 05:39.339
you need to give him these
drops every three hours,

05:39.382 --> 05:42.385
Uh-huh.this pain pill
every four hours,

05:42.429 --> 05:46.215
Uh-huh.and this antibiotic every
six hours, with food.

05:46.258 --> 05:48.260
Got it? Great.
Wait.

05:48.304 --> 05:49.871
[stammers]
Why me?

05:49.914 --> 05:52.352
Because you know my mom
only does babysitting,

05:52.395 --> 05:54.354
not doggie daycare,
but the dog walker

05:54.397 --> 05:56.225
won't give him the medication
for insurance reasons,

05:56.268 --> 05:57.792
so that means that
I have to bring him here.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.359
But I am neck-deep in messaging
on the Fair Work

05:59.402 --> 06:01.143
and Trade Agreement
and I need to focus.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.753
Oh, yeah, and because
when I adopted Waffles,

06:02.797 --> 06:04.581
you said you'd help.

06:04.625 --> 06:07.454
Hey, I do help. I play ball
with him in the park.That's not help,

06:07.497 --> 06:09.151
that's fun.
This is help. So, help.

06:09.194 --> 06:12.807
Okay, okay. I'm on it. Geez.

06:12.850 --> 06:15.636
Oh, Mommy got all upset,
didn't she? Yes, she did.

06:15.679 --> 06:18.943
Now, you be a good boy
till I come back, okay?

06:18.987 --> 06:20.684
Remember: with food.

06:20.728 --> 06:23.034
ELIZABETH:
To conclude,

06:23.078 --> 06:24.601
I think the best strategy
is to get

06:24.645 --> 06:27.299
the Fair Work and Trade
Agreement wrapped up,

06:27.343 --> 06:29.563
finally, and as quickly
as possible,

06:29.606 --> 06:33.436
and to lock in
all the gains we can

06:33.480 --> 06:38.267
before China gets wind of the
potential sale of the F-40s.

06:38.310 --> 06:41.270
Obviously, that means
keep a tight circle.

06:41.313 --> 06:43.272
Meanwhile, I'd like
all relevant departments

06:43.315 --> 06:45.535
to get their recommendations
on the sale

06:45.579 --> 06:47.189
to my office
by the end of the week

06:47.232 --> 06:49.365
so we can make a determination
to pass on to the White House.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.715
Sound good?

06:53.761 --> 06:58.418
Gary, does Political-Military
Affairs have concerns?

06:58.461 --> 07:02.683
Um, I mean, don't you?

07:02.726 --> 07:07.427
Many, which I have expressed
to POTUS, yet here we are.

07:07.470 --> 07:11.561
Wow.Uh, you're welcome
to share yours.

07:11.605 --> 07:15.652
Well, for starters, the shortest
road to World War III

07:15.696 --> 07:18.481
probably runs through
the Taiwan Strait.

07:18.525 --> 07:21.484
So, there's that.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.486
China has been
increasingly overt

07:23.530 --> 07:26.402
in its effort to force Taiwan
into reintegrating, yes.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.187
Which Taiwan resists, in part,
because they know there is

07:29.231 --> 07:32.539
at least an implied promise
of U.S. support.

07:32.582 --> 07:35.759
And we maintain the status quo
through the problematic

07:35.803 --> 07:39.459
but effective policy
of strategic ambiguity.

07:39.502 --> 07:40.808
ELIZABETH: Right.
We-we know.

07:40.851 --> 07:42.679
So what's your point?

07:42.723 --> 07:45.465
That. That is my point.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.118
It-it...
[chuckles]

07:47.162 --> 07:51.514
It's a very delicate balance
here and-and it's... hmm.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.385
L-Look,

07:53.429 --> 07:57.389
does Taiwan want an effective
military deterrent? Of course.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.740
But they don't want
to annoy China into actually

07:59.783 --> 08:01.916
invading them, which is exactly
what this deal could do.

08:01.959 --> 08:05.615
So you're saying Taiwan
may not want the F-40s.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.443
Not "may not," ma'am.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.140
Definitely won't.

08:09.184 --> 08:11.708
JAY: Then perhaps, as
we do from time to time,

08:11.752 --> 08:14.537
we incentivize the purchase.
A loan to offset the costs.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.931
Sure. Why not?

08:16.974 --> 08:20.282
We'll get to work
drafting a proposal.

08:20.325 --> 08:23.067
Super. Blake will liaise
with your department on that.

08:23.111 --> 08:26.027
And I don't disagree
with you, Gary.

08:26.070 --> 08:29.596
State will give POTUS
an honest assessment

08:29.639 --> 08:32.555
of the potential impact
of the deal,

08:32.599 --> 08:34.557
and hopefully,
that'll be the end of it.

08:34.601 --> 08:37.734
But at the end of the day,
we serve at the pleasure.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.736
Understood, ma'am.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.869
Good. Thanks, everybody.

08:41.912 --> 08:44.219
BLAKE:
We're giving Taiwan money

08:44.262 --> 08:45.437
to buy jets they don't want

08:45.481 --> 08:46.743
because we don't
want them, either?

08:46.787 --> 08:49.877
It makes sense once
you accept that it doesn't.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.313
Talk about
strategic ambiguity.

08:51.356 --> 08:53.576
This town's built on it.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.535
Buy me a drink sometime
and I'll explain

08:55.578 --> 08:58.494
how untrammeled corporate greed
distorts our foreign policy

08:58.538 --> 09:01.105
and will one day lead to the
collapse of the United States

09:01.149 --> 09:05.109
and very probably,
civilization writ large.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.155
Sounds fun.

09:07.198 --> 09:09.200
Okay. Later.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.552
See you.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.686
HENRY:
Hey, babe.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.993
Hey, how was your joyride?

09:19.036 --> 09:20.821
Was it joyful?

09:20.864 --> 09:22.257
Did you have
a joyful ride?

09:22.300 --> 09:23.954
It was so great.

09:23.998 --> 09:26.609
Uh-huh.I mean, like I told Jeff,
the plane's kind of a brick,

09:26.653 --> 09:30.091
but it was fantastic
being up there again.

09:30.134 --> 09:34.182
Well, I'm glad you had fun,
because waiting for you

09:34.225 --> 09:36.184
on the ground was
a real treat for me.

09:36.227 --> 09:37.577
[chuckles]Mm-hmm.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.840
[sighs]
Bed.

09:39.883 --> 09:44.627
Hey, why do you say
that the F-40 is a brick?

09:44.671 --> 09:47.717
Well, to be fair, there's a lot
of impressive aspects--

09:47.761 --> 09:49.719
the avionics, the sensor suite.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.591
Like, if a bandit
locks you up...

09:51.634 --> 09:53.593
Back to English, honey.Uh, sorry.

09:53.636 --> 09:57.031
Basically, it has
all these bells and whistles,

09:57.074 --> 10:00.600
like stealth technology,
but they had to give up

10:00.643 --> 10:02.906
a lot of performance
to cram it all in there.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.430
Plus, they're trying to make one
fighter jet to meet the needs

10:05.474 --> 10:07.563
of three different branches
of the military.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.131
It's kind of like
a fighter by committee.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.394
[laughs]:
That's a ringing endorsement.

10:12.437 --> 10:17.225
[phone vibrating]Too slow to fight,
too big to fail.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.227
[moans]

10:19.270 --> 10:21.664
Yes?

10:23.753 --> 10:27.148
Evening, Minister Chen.
This is a surprise.

10:27.191 --> 10:30.847
"Surprise" is indeed an apt
word, Madam Secretary.

10:30.891 --> 10:33.067
China had already made
its extreme displeasure

10:33.110 --> 10:35.635
over your proposed arms sale
to the breakaway province

10:35.678 --> 10:37.941
of Taiwan quite clear
to Washington.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.074
But now we learn that you plan[mouthing]

10:40.117 --> 10:42.337
to add insult to injury.

10:42.380 --> 10:45.383
Uh, I'm not sure
that I follow, Ming.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.385
If you attempt to sell Taiwan

10:47.429 --> 10:50.258
even one F-40 fighter...

10:50.301 --> 10:52.086
China will regard that

10:52.129 --> 10:53.957
as a grave provocation
and respond accordingly.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.829
Ming, I don't know
where you heard...

10:55.872 --> 10:56.960
To begin with...

10:57.004 --> 10:58.962
we will suspend our
participation

10:59.006 --> 11:00.703
in the Fair Work
and Trade Agreement.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.270
More to the point:

11:02.313 --> 11:04.838
we will prepare ourselves
militarily

11:04.881 --> 11:08.537
against this dire threat
to Chinese sovereignty.

11:08.580 --> 11:12.454
I warn you, Madam Secretary,
you are crossing a red line.

11:17.502 --> 11:18.982
How the hell
did China find out about

11:19.026 --> 11:20.549
the F-40 sale
to Taiwan so quick?

11:20.592 --> 11:23.421
Mr. President,
NSA intercepted

11:23.465 --> 11:26.381
communications between
Chinese officials

11:26.424 --> 11:29.340
referencing an internal
State Department memo

11:29.384 --> 11:31.778
generated by the Bureau

11:31.821 --> 11:34.345
of Political-Military
Affairs.

11:35.825 --> 11:37.784
So you're saying the
leak came from my shop?

11:37.827 --> 11:40.221
Certainly appears
that way.

11:40.264 --> 11:43.006
DOJ and FBI is opening
an investigation

11:43.050 --> 11:44.355
to find the source.

11:44.399 --> 11:47.228
We'd appreciate your
cooperation, Madam Secretary.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.316
Of course.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.709
My department's
at your disposal,

11:49.752 --> 11:50.884
whatever you want.

11:50.927 --> 11:53.538
We, uh, have to
stay away from it.

11:53.582 --> 11:56.454
So the investigation stays free
of any political interference.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.718
Yes, clearly.

11:58.761 --> 12:01.416
We're only talking a few dozen
potential suspects here.

12:01.459 --> 12:04.332
Whoever it is might
be close to home.

12:04.375 --> 12:08.118
You sure it'll be
so clear then?

12:08.162 --> 12:10.468
Yeah, Russell, I am.
Do you have a suspect?

12:10.512 --> 12:12.209
We do.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.776
DALTON:
Good.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.344
Meanwhile, we'll, uh,
move forward with the sale

12:16.387 --> 12:17.911
of the jets to Taiwan.

12:17.954 --> 12:20.348
Mr. President, I can tell
when Chen is posturing.

12:20.391 --> 12:21.697
Tonight, he was not.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.351
Neither am I.

12:23.394 --> 12:25.483
China doesn't get to infiltrate
the top echelon

12:25.527 --> 12:27.398
of our government
and then turn around

12:27.442 --> 12:28.573
and say that
we're not playing fair.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.097
It demands a
tough response.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.620
I understand that,
but I'm just saying

12:31.663 --> 12:33.187
that there could be
repercussions.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.797
There always are.

Not cool, little dude.

14:45.623 --> 14:47.234
Not cool.

14:47.277 --> 14:48.844
The evidence
points to the leaker

14:48.888 --> 14:50.498
being someone from Pol-Mil.

14:50.541 --> 14:51.934
Currently, our prime suspect

14:51.978 --> 14:54.415
is Deputy Assistant
Secretary Martin.

14:54.458 --> 14:59.289
You think Gary Martin is a spy?

14:59.333 --> 15:02.858
I'm sorry, that just seems
a bit, uh... far-fetched.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.686

your relationship

15:04.729 --> 15:06.383
with the undersecretary,
Mr. Moran?

15:08.472 --> 15:11.258
Um... we've worked on
a few projects together,

15:11.301 --> 15:12.912
so, friendly, I guess.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.523
I mean, as friendly as you can
be with a professional grouch.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.568
So you would say
he's disgruntled?
Uh, no.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.440
No, I-I don't mean that.

15:19.483 --> 15:20.702
[stammering]:
I think that...

15:20.745 --> 15:22.486
He has a long and
well-documented history

15:22.530 --> 15:24.140
of fierce criticism
of U.S. foreign policy.

15:24.184 --> 15:25.968
Just as I'm sure
long-time DOJ hands

15:26.012 --> 15:28.623
have criticism
of U.S. criminal justice policy.

15:28.666 --> 15:31.408
And numerous personal contacts
within the Chinese military

15:31.452 --> 15:32.583

establishment.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.150
Yes, that-that's his job.

15:35.499 --> 15:38.372
Blake, I admire Gary, too.

15:38.415 --> 15:41.592
But the bottom line
is that his office

15:41.636 --> 15:45.335
generated a highly classified
memo that...

15:45.379 --> 15:48.077
in less than a single day,
found its way

15:48.121 --> 15:49.644
into the hands of the Chinese.

15:49.687 --> 15:53.430
I offered my department's
support of this investigation

15:53.474 --> 15:55.563
because it represents
a grave threat

15:55.606 --> 15:57.217
to our national security.

I can see why you're
shooting up the ranks.

Mr. President, it appears...

18:32.720 --> 18:33.938
that Undersecretary Martin

18:33.982 --> 18:35.810
is not responsible
for the leak.

18:35.853 --> 18:38.726
Our investigators determined
that the memo file on his laptop

18:38.769 --> 18:40.815
had been copied
onto a USB drive.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.730

Megan Morrison.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.610
So, she has some connection
to the Chinese.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.612
Actually, sir,
under questioning,

18:55.656 --> 18:58.920
she revealed that she passed
along the State Department memo

18:58.963 --> 19:01.357
to an employee at
Fossor Industries.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.707
Are you kidding?[scoffs]

19:03.751 --> 19:04.926
What?

19:04.969 --> 19:08.321
She was a spy...
for Fossor?

19:10.192 --> 19:11.889
And then unknown
parties at the company

19:11.933 --> 19:14.153
appear to have passed it
on to Chinese intelligence.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.025
Why on earth

19:17.068 --> 19:19.114
would one of our nation's
top defense contractors

19:19.158 --> 19:22.378
pass secrets to an adversary?

19:22.422 --> 19:24.467
Because if State
recommended

19:24.511 --> 19:29.211
the U.S. not sell Taiwan
the extra 20 F-40s,

19:29.255 --> 19:32.475
that could throw the sale
of the other 80 into doubt.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.608
Then we'd be talking
billions of dollars,

19:34.651 --> 19:36.262
years of R&D down the drain.

19:36.305 --> 19:39.482
ELIZABETH: But if China
found out about the sale,

19:39.526 --> 19:40.918
they'd hit the roof,

19:40.962 --> 19:43.399
and threaten holy hell
if we went through with it.

19:43.443 --> 19:47.186
Which, in turn,
would ensure that we would.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.188
Son of a bitch.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.930
Fossor's trying to box us in.

19:52.974 --> 19:55.411
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

19:55.455 --> 19:58.414
I want to have a little talk
with Fossor's CEO.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.772
So are we sure about this?

20:08.816 --> 20:10.818
Speak now or forever
hold your peace.

20:10.861 --> 20:13.908
Sir, Fossor has widespread
support on the Hill.

20:13.951 --> 20:15.344
Angry as I am,

20:15.388 --> 20:17.781
this is not a fight
we're prepared for.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.566
Nevertheless, it's
the fight we're in.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.263
They put their
corporate interests

20:21.307 --> 20:23.570
above the United States,
they have to pay a price.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.528
It's a big swing,
Mr. President.

20:25.572 --> 20:28.662
There could be major military
readiness issues downstream.

20:28.705 --> 20:31.621
Which is the problem,
in my view.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.928
We've become so dependent
on companies like Fossor

20:33.971 --> 20:36.060
that we're scared
to hold them accountable.

20:36.104 --> 20:39.194
This is exactly the kind
of corrosive situation

20:39.238 --> 20:40.587
that Eisenhower warned us about

20:40.630 --> 20:42.415
in his "military-industrial
complex" speech.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.460
Hank.

20:44.504 --> 20:46.723
As to the particular
legal question at hand,

20:46.767 --> 20:48.508
you're on solid ground, sir.

20:50.771 --> 20:52.642
Well, I for one
am a little tired

20:52.686 --> 20:56.124
of the tail
wagging the dog, so...

20:56.167 --> 20:57.778
let's go.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.828
CHAMPLIN: Mr. President,
we've received the subpoena

21:04.872 --> 21:06.830
and have been in touch
with the Justice Department.

21:06.874 --> 21:09.616
The charges against Fossor
are scurrilous and absurd,

21:09.659 --> 21:12.358
and we intend to fight them
to the last breath.

21:12.401 --> 21:15.491
It's also highly improper for
you to be contacting us at all.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.450
Oh, I can assure you,
I wouldn't do anything

21:17.493 --> 21:19.539
to compromise the case,
Mr. Champlin.

21:19.582 --> 21:21.628
We're calling for
another reason.

21:21.671 --> 21:24.065
Secretary Becker.

21:24.108 --> 21:27.808
Mr. Champlin, on behalf of the
Department of Defense,

21:27.851 --> 21:30.637
I am formally alerting you
that we are exercising

21:30.680 --> 21:33.596
our "Termination of Convenience"
clause with respect to the F-40.

21:33.640 --> 21:38.427
You can't just cancel
a $31 billion contract.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.037
NOLAN: With all due respect,
Mr. Champlin,

21:40.081 --> 21:42.388
yes, we can.And we are.

21:42.431 --> 21:46.740
I'm very sorry to hear that,
Mr. President.

21:46.783 --> 21:49.960
Good day, Mr. Champlin.

21:50.004 --> 21:52.354
I can't believe it.M-Sec thought you should know.

21:52.398 --> 21:55.792
Wait, so, h-his girlfriend was
some kind of sleeper agent

21:55.836 --> 21:57.272
for Fossor the whole time?

21:57.316 --> 21:59.883
Uh... they got their hooks
into her a few years back.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.232
She had debts.

22:01.276 --> 22:02.756
Fossor knew that Gary
played an important role

22:02.799 --> 22:05.062
in vetting overseas
arms sales,

22:05.106 --> 22:06.890
so they kept her
in their back pocket

22:06.934 --> 22:08.762
until they needed her.

22:08.805 --> 22:11.155
What's gonna happen to Gary?

22:11.199 --> 22:12.940
Well, career-wise,
he's toast.

22:12.983 --> 22:15.508
You don't take top secret
files home on your laptop.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.771
The good news is,
now that the F-40s

22:17.814 --> 22:18.902
aren't going to Taiwan,

22:18.946 --> 22:19.773
the Fair Work
and Trade Agreement's

22:19.816 --> 22:21.209
back on the table with China.

22:21.252 --> 22:22.732
The secretary's planning
an off-books meeting

22:22.776 --> 22:26.257
with Chen in Quebec to try
and get him on board again.

22:26.301 --> 22:29.696
And if she does, then we got
a lot of work to do.

22:29.739 --> 22:31.785
So, be ready to rock
and roll, okay?

22:31.828 --> 22:34.527
Yeah, absolutely.

22:34.570 --> 22:37.530
Man... poor Gary.

22:37.573 --> 22:40.707
I-I just feel bad is all.Don't.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.665
He was a suspect in
a massive intelligence breach.

22:42.709 --> 22:44.232
You were on the right side.

22:44.275 --> 22:46.930
Hey, I-I know Gary
wasn't your cup of tea,

22:46.974 --> 22:50.238
but why are you being
so harsh about this?

22:50.281 --> 22:52.632
Because this work we do
is life or death,

22:52.675 --> 22:53.937
and the parties
that we deal with

22:53.981 --> 22:55.374
are playing for keeps.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.158
And they'll exploit any weakness
that they can find.

22:57.201 --> 22:59.203
And you need to
understand that from the jump

22:59.247 --> 23:01.292
if you don't want to
wind up like Gary, okay?

23:01.336 --> 23:03.556
Okay.

23:11.346 --> 23:14.915
CHEN: If the illegal
and provocative sale

23:14.958 --> 23:20.442
of F-40 fighters to the
breakaway province of Taiwan

23:20.486 --> 23:23.967
is in fact cancelled,

23:24.011 --> 23:27.493
then I see no reason why we
cannot continue negotiations

23:27.536 --> 23:29.973
on the Fair Work and
Trade Agreement.

23:30.017 --> 23:32.541
That's great. Great.

23:32.585 --> 23:35.892
Well, I look forward
to working with you again.

23:35.936 --> 23:37.677
On behalf of the rest
of the world,

23:37.720 --> 23:39.983
I say it's abouttime.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.031
[siren wailing in distance]

23:46.033 --> 23:47.948
Well, I'm not
entirely surprised,

23:47.991 --> 23:51.430
but I am relieved
that we were able to have

23:51.473 --> 23:54.520
such a productive conversation.

23:54.563 --> 23:57.740
As am I, Elizabeth.

23:57.784 --> 24:01.091
I think the most surprising
part of the evening was...

24:01.135 --> 24:03.703
they really do say "aboot."

24:03.746 --> 24:05.356
[laughing]

24:05.400 --> 24:07.402
[camera clicking]

24:11.972 --> 24:13.234
JAY: This isn't gonna
surprise anyone,

24:13.277 --> 24:15.062
but China's demanding
a last-minute change

24:15.105 --> 24:17.456
on one of the provisions in the
Fair Work and Trade Agreement,

24:17.499 --> 24:20.763
so now we have to contact all
the other signatory countries

24:20.807 --> 24:22.852
to get their feedback.That's crazy.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.811
If China wants the change,
why don't they contact

24:24.854 --> 24:25.899
all the other countries?

24:25.942 --> 24:27.509
Well, look, China's
giving up a lot

24:27.553 --> 24:28.902
just by signing the agreement.

24:28.945 --> 24:30.991
So?

24:31.034 --> 24:32.383
So, we got China into this.

24:32.427 --> 24:35.038
The least America can do
is help out a little, Matt.

24:35.082 --> 24:36.431
Maybe if China was
being honest

24:36.475 --> 24:37.998
and communicative
about their needs,

24:38.041 --> 24:40.043
America wouldn't have
to scramble

24:40.087 --> 24:42.393
to pick up the slack, Daisy.Well, maybe if America was
a tiny bit more sensitive

24:42.437 --> 24:44.047
to what China's been
going through...Oh, sensitive? Sensitive?

24:44.091 --> 24:47.398
Maybe China and America should
talk about this somewhere else.

24:47.442 --> 24:50.532
Okay, everybody, let's circle
back to this in five.

24:50.576 --> 24:53.361
Matt, Daisy.

24:53.404 --> 24:56.538
Well, I'm sorry
I encouraged you

24:56.582 --> 24:59.019
to adopt Waffles,
who you totally love.

24:59.062 --> 25:00.890
I guess I am
the bad guy here.

25:00.934 --> 25:02.762
No, no, just
the unreliable guy.[scoffs]

25:02.805 --> 25:04.938
JAY:
Okay, so I understand...

25:04.981 --> 25:06.548
we're negotiating
an historic agreement

25:06.592 --> 25:07.897
with our greatest rival,

25:07.941 --> 25:10.944
and you guys are quarreling
about a dog?

25:10.987 --> 25:14.164
Well, anything sounds trivial
when you put it like that.

25:14.208 --> 25:18.212
All right, well, Abby and I
have had a lot of success

25:18.255 --> 25:23.130
in dealing with scheduling
issues around, uh, childcare,

25:23.173 --> 25:24.653
by sharing a calendar.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.002
Could that be an answer?

25:26.046 --> 25:27.787
He'd probably just sleep
through the alerts.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.702
I fell asleep one time.Yeah, in one day.

25:29.745 --> 25:32.052
Okay, okay. Daisy,
how much time per week

25:32.095 --> 25:33.357
do you need someone
to take Waffles?

25:33.401 --> 25:34.750
Honestly, right now,
three days.

25:34.794 --> 25:36.970
And you know my building
doesn't allow pets.

25:37.013 --> 25:40.190
So what do you want me
to do about that?

25:40.234 --> 25:42.018
Oh, come on.

25:42.062 --> 25:43.106
[crying]:
I'm sorry.

25:43.150 --> 25:45.979
What's going on?

25:46.022 --> 25:47.371
DAISY:
Matt's right.

25:47.415 --> 25:49.852
He did say at the outset

25:49.896 --> 25:52.202
his building doesn't
allow dogs.

25:52.246 --> 25:55.292
But I was concerned,
when I first adopted Waffles,

25:55.336 --> 25:58.078
that I wouldn't have the
resources to take care of him

25:58.121 --> 26:01.037
in the way that he deserves.

26:01.081 --> 26:03.170
And as much as it
breaks my heart...

26:04.954 --> 26:07.000
...I think I'm gonna have to
find a new home for him.

26:07.043 --> 26:09.393
Wait, are you serious?

26:09.437 --> 26:10.786
You got any better ideas?

26:10.830 --> 26:13.006
Oh, sorry, am I...

26:13.049 --> 26:14.834
No, it's fine.
What's up, Nina?

26:14.877 --> 26:16.923
The secretary wants
to see you right away.

26:22.102 --> 26:23.843
ELIZABETH:
I didn't push POTUS

26:23.886 --> 26:24.931
into anything.RUSSELL: Oh, come on.

26:24.974 --> 26:26.628
We both know you've
got his ear.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.151
You-you wanted to see me, ma'am?

26:28.195 --> 26:30.937
[sighs] Yes.We've got a problem.

26:30.980 --> 26:33.983
We won't get into
of whose making it is.

26:34.027 --> 26:35.942
I thought we could use
your expertise

26:35.985 --> 26:36.986
from your time on the Hill.

26:37.030 --> 26:39.946
I didn't.

26:39.989 --> 26:43.253
This happened just
a few minutes ago.

26:43.297 --> 26:45.429
Congressman Brandt.
Here we go.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.040
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

26:47.083 --> 26:50.043
When I heard that President
Dalton ordered the cancellation

26:50.086 --> 26:51.305
of the F-40 fighter--

26:51.348 --> 26:53.350
the key to our nation's
future air defense--

26:53.394 --> 26:54.569
I was alarmed.

26:54.613 --> 26:58.660
When I found out why,
I became enraged.

26:58.704 --> 27:01.663
Turns out the president
just can't bring himself to sell

27:01.707 --> 27:05.928
20 F-40s to our good friends
in Taiwan,

27:05.972 --> 27:07.930
who so desperately want
and need them.

27:07.974 --> 27:09.279
Okay, that's a lie.Oh, he's just getting started.

27:09.323 --> 27:10.716
And why?

27:10.759 --> 27:13.153
Because he and Secretary of
State Elizabeth McCord

27:13.196 --> 27:16.635
thought it was more important
to appease their real friends,

27:16.678 --> 27:18.158
the Chinese.

27:18.201 --> 27:22.553
Look how cozy those two are.

27:22.597 --> 27:24.207
That's why I've introduced

27:24.251 --> 27:25.992
an emergency rider
to the upcoming spending bill.

27:26.035 --> 27:30.344
The president may be comfortable
with killing tens of thousands

27:30.387 --> 27:31.693
of jobs across the nation,

27:31.737 --> 27:33.739
endangering our friends
in Taiwan,

27:33.782 --> 27:36.698
and putting our nation's
security at risk,

27:36.742 --> 27:38.221
but I am not.

27:38.265 --> 27:41.224
Thank you.[reporters clamoring]

27:41.268 --> 27:43.009
Fossor's flexing its muscle
on the Hill

27:43.052 --> 27:44.663
to try to force us to
go through with the contract.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.403
Unbelievable.

27:46.447 --> 27:51.234
So, unless the three of us
figure something out quick,

27:51.278 --> 27:53.759
looks like our only
choice is either to

27:53.802 --> 27:56.196
shut down the government or...[thunder crashes]

27:56.239 --> 27:58.502
let them get away with it.

27:58.546 --> 28:01.027
You hear that?

28:01.070 --> 28:04.944
That's the sound of Eisenhower
turning in his grave.

28:13.430 --> 28:16.303
I'm on record
as having doubts.

28:16.346 --> 28:18.566
Well, we have to
at least give Congress

28:18.609 --> 28:20.655
a chance to do the right thing
and vote no

28:20.699 --> 28:22.309
on that stupid rider.

28:22.352 --> 28:23.614
Well, forgive me if I'm
less than sanguine

28:23.658 --> 28:25.573
about appealing
to the better angels

28:25.616 --> 28:27.575
of the hacks on the
Appropriations Committee.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.882
Any better ideas?
David, hi.
Hi.

28:29.925 --> 28:31.187
Thank you for coming
to represent Taiwan.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.624
And, Jeff, thank you
for pulling this together

28:33.668 --> 28:34.974
on such short notice,

28:35.017 --> 28:36.932
and with such discretion.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.586
I'm pretty curious

28:38.629 --> 28:41.415
why POTUS tried to cancel the
Fossor deal in the first place.

28:41.458 --> 28:44.113
Well, it's a...
[chuckles]

28:44.157 --> 28:45.201
It's a doozy.

28:45.245 --> 28:47.377
I'm all ears.

28:47.421 --> 28:50.641
ELIZABETH: Hi, everyone.
Thank you for coming.

28:50.685 --> 28:55.037
I know the president's
cancellation of the contract

28:55.081 --> 28:57.692
with Fossor caught many
of you off guard.

28:57.736 --> 29:02.784
So let me say that
we well understand

29:02.828 --> 29:04.917
the historic
and important role

29:04.960 --> 29:07.789
that Fossor Industries plays
in our national defense.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.922
Not to mention the
tens of thousands

29:09.965 --> 29:11.793
of jobs they create.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.056
And we should hasten to add
the F-40's an excellent plane.

29:14.100 --> 29:18.539
Yeah. But the fact is...

29:18.582 --> 29:21.934
Fossor engaged in espionage
against the State Department,

29:21.977 --> 29:25.502
and then leaked
top secret material

29:25.546 --> 29:30.246
pertaining to the potential sale
of the F-40 to the Chinese

29:30.290 --> 29:33.641
to force us to go
forward with the deal.

29:33.684 --> 29:34.903
Lastly,

29:34.947 --> 29:37.123
Congressman Brandt
falsely claimed

29:37.166 --> 29:42.519
that Taiwan desperately wants
those extra F-40s.

29:42.563 --> 29:45.740
To rebut that assertion
once and for all,

29:45.784 --> 29:47.698
I yield the floor
to David Yu,

29:47.742 --> 29:51.877
from the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Office.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.879
We don't want the jets.

29:53.922 --> 29:55.881
Seriously, we don't.

29:55.924 --> 29:58.100
Please don't send them.

30:00.711 --> 30:03.758
Thank you, David.
Thanks.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.848
If you vote for Brandt's rider,

30:06.892 --> 30:09.546
you'll be voting to risk
shutting down the government,

30:09.590 --> 30:12.854
endangering the national
interest on behalf of a company

30:12.898 --> 30:16.727
whose actions show it
only cares for its own.

30:16.771 --> 30:21.689
Please... vote no.

30:21.732 --> 30:23.256
ELIZABETH:
Thank you for your time.

30:23.299 --> 30:25.824
GROUP:
Thank you.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.699
HENRY:
Jeff. Hey.

30:31.742 --> 30:32.961
What was the sense
in the room?

30:33.005 --> 30:36.051
[sighs]
Hard to say.

30:36.095 --> 30:39.750
What? Did they not hear
what Elizabeth said?

30:39.794 --> 30:42.057
Look, as long as these
spying allegations

30:42.101 --> 30:44.712
against Fossor
remain unproven,

30:44.755 --> 30:47.802
members have political cover
to stick with them.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.152
Wow.
There's a facility
in my district.

30:50.196 --> 30:54.722
Manufactures the wing-fluid
delivery systems for the F-40.

30:54.765 --> 30:57.681
That's 200 high-paying
American jobs.

30:57.725 --> 31:01.555
Adding the tax base,
local businesses...

31:01.598 --> 31:04.253
More important,
they're not just jobs.

31:04.297 --> 31:06.647
They're people.

31:08.997 --> 31:13.175
Look, Jeff,
I'm not a congressman.

31:13.219 --> 31:15.395
But I was a Marine pilot,
just like you.

31:15.438 --> 31:19.312
And I swore an oath
to defend the Constitution,

31:19.355 --> 31:20.835
not a corporation.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.272
And I sure as hell wouldn't send
one of my brothers

31:23.316 --> 31:25.796
and sisters in arms on a sortie
in a plane I didn't believe in.

31:25.840 --> 31:30.714
The Secretary of Defense
says it's fine.

31:30.758 --> 31:31.846
Well, you know better?

31:31.890 --> 31:34.936
Okay.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.895
Thanks for setting
the meeting up.

31:53.694 --> 31:55.130
Tell me that's ginger ale.

31:58.742 --> 32:02.007
Listen, I appreciate
the concern, I guess,

32:02.050 --> 32:05.184
but how about we take a
rain check on whatever this is?

32:05.227 --> 32:07.012
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

32:07.055 --> 32:09.840
For pretending to be my friend
so the Feds could toss my place?

32:12.452 --> 32:14.889
Hey, no problem, pal.

32:18.284 --> 32:20.982
I'm lucky they didn't fire me.

32:21.026 --> 32:23.245
I screwed up with the laptop,
I own that.

32:25.813 --> 32:27.423
But you know what really hurts?

32:27.467 --> 32:31.297
I mean, bes...
besides the Meg of it all,

32:31.340 --> 32:33.777
which I won't go into,
other than to say,

32:33.821 --> 32:35.388
I spent the last
ten Thanksgivings

32:35.431 --> 32:37.216
with her senile,
but also racist dad,

32:37.259 --> 32:38.826
which was
a barrel of laughs,

32:38.869 --> 32:40.784
and this is
the thanks I get.

32:40.828 --> 32:43.962
What hurts

32:44.005 --> 32:46.007
is that they could think
that someone who has fought

32:46.051 --> 32:49.184
as hard as I have
to make our foreign policy

32:49.228 --> 32:52.057
actually line up with our values

32:52.100 --> 32:54.929
could be a spy,

32:54.973 --> 32:58.977
that I would ever
sell this country out.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.761
Ah...

33:02.763 --> 33:05.766
That hurts pretty damn bad.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.339
What do you do now?

33:13.382 --> 33:15.080
Um...

33:15.123 --> 33:17.343
take my pension,
get out of Dodge.

33:17.386 --> 33:20.999
Find a small town,
lay low for a while.

33:22.696 --> 33:24.393
What about Boston?

33:27.440 --> 33:29.094
I checked in with
some friends at Harvard.

33:29.137 --> 33:32.923
The Kennedy School is looking
for a Senior Fellow.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.838
You'd make a great
teacher, Gary.

33:34.882 --> 33:39.147
Eh, you're just saying that
'cause I rant a lot.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.541
Yeah.

33:41.584 --> 33:43.891
It'd be your dream job.

33:48.113 --> 33:52.160
You know, for a seventh floor
type, you got a big heart.

33:52.204 --> 33:55.642
Too big, I'm told.

33:55.685 --> 33:58.427
Listen to me,

33:58.471 --> 34:00.777
to keep fighting the good fight
in this line of work,

34:00.821 --> 34:02.083
you have to have a big heart

34:02.127 --> 34:04.651
because it's constantly
being chipped away at.

34:04.694 --> 34:07.784
See? Natural teacher.

34:11.397 --> 34:12.833
[sighs]

34:12.876 --> 34:17.359
I really will think it over.
It's ginger ale, by the way.

34:17.403 --> 34:22.060
Oh. I'm glad.
Do you mind if I have...

34:22.103 --> 34:23.670
No. Knock yourself out.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.585
I'll have a martini.

34:25.628 --> 34:28.849
Hi, Russell, come on in.Evening. I was
on my way home.

34:28.892 --> 34:30.590
Hey.
ELIZABETH: Hey.

34:30.633 --> 34:34.072
Thought I'd give you the
inspiring news in person.

34:34.115 --> 34:36.813
Well, you don't
look inspired.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.946
Unofficial whip
count looks like

34:38.989 --> 34:40.817
the spending bill
with Brandt's rider

34:40.861 --> 34:44.125
has the votes
to override a veto.

34:44.169 --> 34:47.085
We just met with the committee
members a few hours ago.

34:47.128 --> 34:48.912
How can there already
be a whip vote?

34:48.956 --> 34:50.914
Amazing how fast
Congress can move

34:50.958 --> 34:53.656
when their own reelections
are at stake.

34:53.700 --> 34:56.050
So I guess America's
gonna buy those planes,

34:56.094 --> 34:58.052
whether we need
them or not.

34:58.096 --> 35:02.056
Oh, and word is your buddy
Jeff Pearson's a yes, too.

35:05.015 --> 35:06.147
[chuckles]:
Well...

35:06.191 --> 35:07.888
don't stand there
looking all wounded,

35:07.931 --> 35:10.630
like I just told you
the Easter Bunny's not real.

35:10.673 --> 35:14.721
This is Washington, kids,
and I told you we weren't ready

35:14.764 --> 35:16.592
for this fight.

35:21.989 --> 35:24.296
If Congress jams
that rider through,

35:24.339 --> 35:25.993
China will hit back quickly.

35:26.036 --> 35:29.039
They'll pull out of the
Fair Work and Trade Agreement.

35:29.083 --> 35:31.303
They'll step up naval activity
in the Taiwan Strait.

35:31.346 --> 35:32.565
RUSSELL:
Our hands are tied.

35:32.608 --> 35:34.219
They won.

35:34.262 --> 35:38.745
No company should get to dictate
to the United States government.

35:38.788 --> 35:40.181
DALTON:
You know,

35:40.225 --> 35:43.053
for a president
who took some grief

35:43.097 --> 35:47.841
about playing too much golf,
Eisenhower got a lot done.

35:47.884 --> 35:52.367
The interstate highway system,
fighting for desegregation,

35:52.411 --> 35:56.110
pushing back the Soviets.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.460
But that famous
speech about the...

35:58.504 --> 36:02.551
military-industrial
complex?

36:02.595 --> 36:06.773
That was his final
speech in office.

36:06.816 --> 36:09.384
Do you think there
was a reason for that?

36:09.428 --> 36:12.909
An effective president
gets two or three things done

36:12.953 --> 36:15.999
that really move
the country forward.

36:16.043 --> 36:20.178
A truly excellent one,
maybe four.

36:20.221 --> 36:22.702
I think you'll be
an excellent one.

36:22.745 --> 36:26.140
Well, thank you, sir.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.403
But...
The point is,

36:28.447 --> 36:33.103
if you want to bring Fossor
and its ilk to heel, Godspeed.

36:33.147 --> 36:37.760
Just be sure that that's
the most important thing to you

36:37.804 --> 36:39.980
because there won't be
much room for anything else.

36:40.023 --> 36:42.461
Understood, sir.What's the word, Hank?

36:42.504 --> 36:44.985
Mr. President, I wanted
to apprise you personally

36:45.028 --> 36:46.595
of some developments
in the Fossor case.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.206
Shoot.

36:48.249 --> 36:52.035
Based on an anonymous tip, we've
uncovered a pattern at Fossor

36:52.079 --> 36:54.124
of some very serious
public corruption,

36:54.168 --> 36:57.040
including numerous
campaign finance violations.

36:57.084 --> 36:58.216
What, the dark money

36:58.259 --> 37:00.609
they already dump
into campaigns,

37:00.653 --> 37:03.003
but legally don't even
have to report,

37:03.046 --> 37:04.265
wasn't quite enough
for them, huh?

37:04.309 --> 37:08.138
How high up
does the corruption go?

37:09.792 --> 37:11.490
Thanks, Jose.

37:11.533 --> 37:14.188
Lot of guys would be mad

37:14.232 --> 37:17.365
they skulled that last shot,
but not me,

37:17.409 --> 37:18.714
'cause what do I always say?

37:18.758 --> 37:21.282
"Adversity is opportunity," sir.[chuckles]

37:21.326 --> 37:24.111
That's right. Okay.

37:24.154 --> 37:27.549
Hit the sand
behind the ball.

37:27.593 --> 37:29.899
Easy power,
easy power.

37:29.943 --> 37:32.511
Uh, sir...

37:32.554 --> 37:34.600
Sir.
What, Jose?

37:37.124 --> 37:38.778
James Champlin?

37:46.307 --> 37:48.396
[indistinct chatter]

37:48.440 --> 37:51.181
I wouldn't know, either.
Oh, Congressman Chivvers.

37:51.225 --> 37:52.487
Congressman Faustino,Congresswoman Robertson.

37:52.531 --> 37:53.967
Good to see you.

37:54.010 --> 37:56.535
Guessing you just heard
about James Champlin's arrest.

37:56.578 --> 37:58.537
That's quite a list of charges.

37:58.580 --> 38:03.193
All those allegations of
campaign finance violations...

38:03.237 --> 38:04.804
[clicks tongue]
Who knows where that's gonna go.

38:04.847 --> 38:06.327
CHIVVERS: We're not
going to support

38:06.371 --> 38:08.590
Brandt's rider, if that's
what you want to know.

38:08.634 --> 38:11.550
FAUSTINO: Support
among members is...

38:11.593 --> 38:13.203
falling.

38:13.247 --> 38:15.336
It's crashing back to Earth and
breaking up on reentry, Herb.

38:15.380 --> 38:17.295
Well, you're the one that
twisted my arm, Susan.

38:17.338 --> 38:19.775
We needed those jobs...[overlapping arguing]

38:19.819 --> 38:22.256
[arguing continues]

38:22.300 --> 38:25.346
Well, thank you for this glimpse
into your deliberative process.

38:25.390 --> 38:28.001
[arguing continues]

38:31.221 --> 38:33.006
Waffles can stay with me
three days a week.

38:33.049 --> 38:34.834
I know you mean well,
but this is actually

38:34.877 --> 38:37.184
really difficult...No. No, no, no.

38:37.227 --> 38:40.274
Listen, I spoke to my landlord,

38:40.318 --> 38:42.276
and he agreed to make
an exception in this case.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.453
Why?

38:45.497 --> 38:48.500
Because I'm a terrific tenant,
and he doesn't want to lose me,

38:48.543 --> 38:50.284
and I might've
also said that Waffles

38:50.328 --> 38:51.851
is an emotional support dog.

38:51.894 --> 38:53.592
That you only have part-time?

38:53.635 --> 38:56.377
Mr. Manukian is old, okay?

38:56.421 --> 38:58.597
It's possible he might not
have heard everything I said.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.555
The point is, it worked.

39:00.599 --> 39:05.255
Or it will,
as long as Waffles...

39:05.299 --> 39:07.388
wears this.

39:07.432 --> 39:08.998
Come here.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.784
Who's good?I don't know if this is right.

39:11.827 --> 39:14.613
Good. Think of it this way:

39:14.656 --> 39:17.746
Waffles is emotionally
supporting you

39:17.790 --> 39:20.270
by staying with me

39:20.314 --> 39:22.577
three days a week.
All right.

39:22.621 --> 39:26.712
Come here, baby. [grunts]

39:26.755 --> 39:28.366
Does that work?

39:31.456 --> 39:33.240
I'm sorry I got so mad.

39:33.283 --> 39:36.852
I'm sorry you had to.

39:36.896 --> 39:39.768
Looks like he's the one who
needs the support. [chuckles]

39:39.812 --> 39:43.381
I don't know.
I feel better already.

39:43.424 --> 39:44.817
How about you?

39:44.860 --> 39:48.211
Yeah. Do you want to go home?

39:51.301 --> 39:53.608
Thanks, man.

39:53.652 --> 39:55.958
Thanks for agreeing
to meet with me.

40:01.442 --> 40:04.837
You were right, I don't totally
understand all the pressures

40:04.880 --> 40:07.796
you're under as
a congressman.

40:07.840 --> 40:12.192
So you know, I was prepared to
vote "yes" on the Brandt rider.

40:12.235 --> 40:14.455
Might not have been
the gutsiest vote I ever took,

40:14.499 --> 40:17.415
but in any case,
it's moot now.

40:17.458 --> 40:21.157
Well, I just didn't want you to
think I was moralizing at you.

40:21.201 --> 40:22.855
Not to worry.

40:22.898 --> 40:24.334
You know something, Hank,

40:24.378 --> 40:26.772
you always did see things
pretty clearly,

40:26.815 --> 40:28.208
how they might play out.

40:28.251 --> 40:32.430
You definitely clocked
this situation with Fossor

40:32.473 --> 40:36.172
better than I did.

40:36.216 --> 40:37.783
Until recently, anyway.

40:44.180 --> 40:48.184
The anonymous source
that tipped off the DOJ...

40:55.844 --> 40:58.804
Like you said, end of the day,

40:58.847 --> 41:01.154
I'm still a Marine.

41:01.197 --> 41:03.461
Oorah.

41:06.507 --> 41:07.639
[laughter]
Bess.

41:07.682 --> 41:09.031
Mr. President.

41:09.075 --> 41:11.425
Join us for a toast.Love to.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.382
BECKER:
There you are.

41:12.426 --> 41:13.601
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

41:13.645 --> 41:15.211
There's a lot
to be proud of.

41:15.255 --> 41:17.344
Yeah. James Champlin and Fossor
will have to answer

41:17.387 --> 41:18.824
for their corruption in court,

41:18.867 --> 41:22.131
the Fair Work and Trade
Agreement is back on track,

41:22.175 --> 41:23.524
and we're only
buying 80

41:23.568 --> 41:25.918
F-40 fighters,
as we originally agreed.

41:25.961 --> 41:27.615
BECKER: Pretty good
day's work, I'd say.

41:27.659 --> 41:29.356
I'm sorry, excuse me?

41:29.399 --> 41:31.532
The scandal brought Fossor
back to the table.

41:31.576 --> 41:34.187
They agreed to eat the cost
of the additional 20 jets,

41:34.230 --> 41:35.405
so we won't have to.

41:35.449 --> 41:37.973
We got what we wanted.
We won.

41:38.017 --> 41:40.541
No, we won before,

41:40.585 --> 41:42.804
when the contract
was cancelled altogether.

41:42.848 --> 41:44.763
That would've left us with
no next-generation fighters

41:44.806 --> 41:47.548
in the pipeline.You said we could retrofit
the YF-31.

41:47.592 --> 41:50.072
Well, guess who revised
their budget estimates upward?

41:50.116 --> 41:52.161
The manufacturer of the YF-31.Yes.

41:52.205 --> 41:53.554
But we had leverage.

41:53.598 --> 41:55.730
Fossor's the devil
we know at this point.

41:55.774 --> 41:56.731
Yes,

41:56.775 --> 41:59.299
but they are still the devil,

41:59.342 --> 42:03.259
and the F-40 is still
an overpriced albatross

42:03.303 --> 42:06.828
and the whole system
needs to be changed. Sir...

42:06.872 --> 42:10.745
We fought the world's largest
defense contractor to a draw.

42:10.789 --> 42:12.007
With these people,

42:12.051 --> 42:13.835
that's as close to a win
as you're gonna get.

42:13.879 --> 42:16.708
Now, can we drink, finally?Mm.

42:16.751 --> 42:19.014
Actually, I'm already
a little dizzy.

42:19.058 --> 42:20.886
I think I'll say good night.
Thank you.

42:20.929 --> 42:24.585
I told you before, Bess,

42:24.629 --> 42:26.195
if you want to use up
your presidency

42:26.239 --> 42:27.501
fighting for that win,

42:27.545 --> 42:30.635
be my guest.

42:30.678 --> 42:33.986
You can count on it, sir.

42:37.206 --> 42:40.558
Due respect, sir,
I would call this a win,

42:40.601 --> 42:42.472
for you and the American people.
