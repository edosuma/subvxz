01:07.212 --> 01:09.246
<i>Will you smoke with me,</i>
<i>Da Vinci?</i>

01:09.314 --> 01:12.683
<i>Well, that depends</i>
<i>on what's in the pipe.</i>

01:12.751 --> 01:16.354
<i>It is a mixture of tobacco</i>
<i>and black hellebore</i>

01:16.488 --> 01:18.890
and is rumored
to induce visions

01:18.957 --> 01:20.625
and summon demons.

01:20.693 --> 01:22.893
Well, I believe in neither.

01:22.961 --> 01:27.632
Then why do you struggle so
hard to keep both at bay?

01:37.011 --> 01:39.746
History is a lie that has
been honed like a weapon

01:39.814 --> 01:42.116
<i>by people who have</i>
<i>suppressed the truth.</i>

01:42.183 --> 01:44.652
The knowledge you are
destined to learn

01:44.719 --> 01:47.421
will upend the established
order of things.

01:47.489 --> 01:49.624
How could you possibly
know that?

01:49.691 --> 01:51.411
You have heard the phrase
'Time is a river'?

01:51.460 --> 01:52.794
Yes.

01:52.861 --> 01:57.665
What most fail to grasp is
that the river is circular.

01:57.733 --> 02:00.435
One man's death
opens a doorway

02:00.503 --> 02:02.170
to the birth
of the next.

02:03.072 --> 02:04.372
Would you like
to know how

02:04.440 --> 02:06.841
this particular
doorway opened?

02:06.909 --> 02:08.309
Yes.

02:08.377 --> 02:11.279
Be forewarned, then.

02:11.347 --> 02:14.683
Some doorways
lead into darkness.

02:42.375 --> 02:46.144
Out you go, boy.
Get on with you!

02:55.822 --> 02:58.490
Go on! Go on!

03:05.397 --> 03:07.298
Cicco!

03:10.767 --> 03:13.735
- What day is it today?
- Palm Sunday.

03:13.803 --> 03:15.370
Oh, balls.

03:15.438 --> 03:18.139
The Duchess and your children
are already at the church.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.241
Could you round me up
some coddled eggs?

03:22.309 --> 03:26.978
I have a beastly hangover and
my bowels are in a tumble.

03:27.046 --> 03:29.113
I'll be dressed
in but a minute.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.732
At ease, people,
I've arrived!

03:58.235 --> 04:01.737
Be gone, you artless fuckwit.
This is my moment.

04:01.805 --> 04:03.338
And thanks to
the Secret Archives,

04:03.406 --> 04:05.440
it's the last you
will ever enjoy!

04:05.508 --> 04:07.275
Ah!

04:27.229 --> 04:29.497
<i>Tell me a secret,</i>
<i>Leonardo.</i>

04:29.565 --> 04:33.435
What was your...
earliest memory?

04:33.503 --> 04:35.537
Or better yet,

04:35.605 --> 04:37.573
your greatest fear?

04:37.640 --> 04:39.241
In my case...

04:39.309 --> 04:41.277
the two go hand-in-hand.

04:41.345 --> 04:42.812
I was...um...

04:42.880 --> 04:44.714
I was six months old.

04:44.782 --> 04:46.716
No-one remembers
back that far.

04:46.784 --> 04:48.284
Well, perhaps
I'm unique, then.

04:48.352 --> 04:51.688
- Oh.
- My mother...um...

04:53.157 --> 04:57.594
<i>...put me in a cradle</i>
<i>out in the field.</i>

04:57.661 --> 05:00.830
<i>And a falcon flew down.</i>
<i>I can still recall it.</i>

05:00.898 --> 05:04.834
It just perched there,
looking at me

05:04.902 --> 05:06.669
<i>almost as if it were</i>
<i>trying to reveal</i>

05:06.737 --> 05:09.072
<i>some kind</i>
<i>of mystery.</i>

05:09.140 --> 05:10.640
<i>My mother drove it away.</i>

05:10.708 --> 05:13.510
Yet, as clear as
that memory is,

05:13.577 --> 05:15.745
the one thing I
can never recall..

05:15.813 --> 05:18.715
is my mother's face.

05:18.783 --> 05:24.388
I can draw anything I've
seen, even in passing.

05:24.456 --> 05:28.726
But when it comes to my
mother, all I see is a void.

05:28.794 --> 05:31.128
She disappeared that night
and I've been...

05:31.196 --> 05:33.231
trying to recall her face
ever since.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.600
All men are searching
for their mothers.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.969
That's what guides you
between our thighs.

05:38.037 --> 05:40.004
I pay you to pose,
Vanessa.

05:40.071 --> 05:42.272
Not to plumb the innermost
depths of my character.

05:42.340 --> 05:44.641
If you expect me to bare
my figure for you,

05:44.709 --> 05:48.345
I expect you to bare
your soul in return.

05:48.413 --> 05:51.582
So, tell me, is there
nothing else you fear?

05:58.223 --> 06:00.191
Only imperfection.

06:00.259 --> 06:02.360
Maestro! Maestro!

06:02.428 --> 06:05.397
You're late, Nico.

06:05.465 --> 06:08.133
You're late. Verrocchio's
been looking for you.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.769
Well, he can wait. We've an
experiment to conduct.

06:10.837 --> 06:13.004
You're meant to play
a principal role in it.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.107
- Come on!
- Hello.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.243
They're called breasts, Nico.
Every woman possesses them.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.412
<i>Nico!</i>
That's Vanessa.

06:20.479 --> 06:23.381
She's newly liberated from
the Convent of St Anthony.

06:23.449 --> 06:27.052
Now help me do this.

06:27.119 --> 06:29.087
Climb into that harness.

06:29.155 --> 06:30.956
Hey today,

06:31.024 --> 06:33.093
we are attempting to
ascertain whether or not

06:33.161 --> 06:35.596
this kite can provide the
necessary wind resistance

06:35.664 --> 06:36.797
to support
your weight.

06:36.865 --> 06:38.566
Well, Maestro,
what if it can't?

06:38.633 --> 06:41.402
Vanessa, do you mind just
dancing about for a moment?

06:41.470 --> 06:43.437
You see? Those
weighted ribbons

06:43.505 --> 06:44.839
allow me to calculate
the strength

06:44.907 --> 06:46.374
<i>and direction</i>
<i>of the wind.</i>

06:46.441 --> 06:50.178
<i>In this case, I would say...</i>
<i>it's about 20 knots</i>

06:50.246 --> 06:52.214
and shifting...

06:52.282 --> 06:53.882
westerly.

06:53.950 --> 06:55.550
Ha ha ha!

06:55.618 --> 06:57.085
Yah!

06:57.153 --> 07:00.155
Wait, Maestro! What if your
calculations are wrong?

07:04.862 --> 07:09.199
<i>Wait, wait, Maestro! Oh,</i>
<i>Maestro, please, please stop!</i>

07:10.602 --> 07:13.270
<i>Oh, wait, Maestro.</i>
<i>Maestro!</i>

07:17.675 --> 07:19.976
Ha ha ha!

07:27.419 --> 07:29.187
Oh, my God, please!

07:38.599 --> 07:39.933
Aaa-aaargh!

07:40.000 --> 07:41.668
Yes!

07:41.736 --> 07:44.905
You're flying, Nico!

07:44.973 --> 07:46.941
Maestro-o-o!

07:47.576 --> 07:49.143
It's perfect!

07:52.782 --> 07:59.989
Uh. Uh.

08:00.057 --> 08:02.191
You're too high! Not so high.

08:02.259 --> 08:04.026
Nico!

08:37.426 --> 08:40.028
It works! It works, Maestro!

08:40.096 --> 08:42.931
I never had any doubts.

08:46.135 --> 08:48.103
Oh, God,
I hate this place.

08:48.170 --> 08:50.805
What? Where else could we
practice our flights

08:50.873 --> 08:52.607
but in Florence?

08:52.675 --> 08:54.943
Anywhere else, we'd just be
burnt at the stake

08:55.010 --> 08:56.077
for our efforts.

08:57.413 --> 09:00.414
But here? I'm just another
free-thinking heretic.

09:00.482 --> 09:02.250
Chaos. Culture.

09:02.318 --> 09:04.585
It's all celebrated
within these walls.

09:04.653 --> 09:07.621
Florence only demands one
thing of its people.

09:07.689 --> 09:10.925
To be truly awake.

09:13.295 --> 09:15.796
Like that angelic vision.

09:15.864 --> 09:18.465
Don't even think about it.
That's Lucrezia Donati.

09:18.533 --> 09:21.735
Lorenzo de Medici's mistress.
I'm well aware of who she is.

09:21.802 --> 09:23.002
He'll break you on
the wheel,

09:23.070 --> 09:24.404
if he catches you
looking at her.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.342
But what if she's caught
looking at me?

09:36.751 --> 09:38.719
Bad tidings
from Milan, Nico.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.454
How can you tell?

09:40.522 --> 09:43.424
That serpent on the rider's
surcoat is the Biscione,

09:43.492 --> 09:46.627
the Sforza family emblem.

09:46.695 --> 09:48.262
<i>If he was bringing good news,</i>
<i>he'd have been dressed</i>

09:48.330 --> 09:51.266
<i>in the more traditional red</i>
<i>and white shield of Milan.</i>

09:51.333 --> 09:52.700
Whatever the message is,

09:52.768 --> 09:54.602
Lorenzo won't be
happy with it.

10:14.223 --> 10:16.057
Out!

10:16.125 --> 10:19.461
Out! All of you!

10:19.528 --> 10:21.996
<i>Lorenzo? Lorenzo!</i>

10:23.532 --> 10:27.434
The Duke of Milan is dead.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.770
- Assassinated.
- By whose hand?

10:29.838 --> 10:33.507
- Visconti and two others.
- An honor killing, then.

10:33.575 --> 10:36.577
They say the Duke
deflowered his niece.

10:36.644 --> 10:39.280
Sforza was a pig
of epic appetites.

10:39.348 --> 10:42.350
Yes, but he was our pig!

10:42.418 --> 10:45.119
I sense the Vatican's hand
behind this.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.554
The timing is just
too perfect.

10:47.622 --> 10:50.991
If you're right, this upsets the
balance of power in Italy, Lorenzo.

10:51.058 --> 10:53.327
Oh, by God, Becchi,
this more than upsets.

10:53.394 --> 10:55.362
This all but decapitates
the concept

10:55.430 --> 10:57.564
and shits down
its throat!

11:04.540 --> 11:06.707
We need to shore up public
support.

11:06.775 --> 11:08.776
Easter holiday is
nearly upon us.

11:08.844 --> 11:10.778
Let's throw a carnival.

11:10.846 --> 11:12.914
<i>Allow the people</i>
<i>of Florence to celebrate</i>

11:12.982 --> 11:14.849
<i>the end of Lent</i>
<i>as they do its arrival.</i>

11:14.917 --> 11:16.551
The more flamboyant
the pageantry,

11:16.619 --> 11:18.186
the stronger
we appear.

11:18.254 --> 11:21.156
We're not fucking peacocks,
Giuliano.

11:21.224 --> 11:22.724
Carnival is all
well and good,

11:22.792 --> 11:24.493
but if it has no teeth
behind it,

11:24.561 --> 11:27.095
we might as well slit
our own throats.

11:34.203 --> 11:36.972
Are you frightened?

11:37.039 --> 11:40.008
No, Most Holy Father.

11:40.076 --> 11:42.110
Lying is a sin,
my dear boy.

11:42.178 --> 11:44.380
It separates us
from God's grace.

11:48.018 --> 11:52.622
Yes, I'm frightened.

11:52.690 --> 11:56.059
But that's also a lie,
isn't it?

11:56.127 --> 11:59.163
At least, a partial one.

11:59.231 --> 12:02.299
A venial sin, perhaps.

12:02.367 --> 12:03.868
So...

12:03.935 --> 12:06.203
which statement
is correct?

12:06.271 --> 12:08.773
Hm?

12:08.840 --> 12:10.708
Speak, child.

12:10.775 --> 12:13.344
Don't you want
to enter heaven?

12:15.647 --> 12:18.949
The proper answer
would be...

12:20.919 --> 12:24.188
Please! His Holiness
has forbidden any visitors.

12:24.256 --> 12:27.358
Our men succeeded,
Your Grace!

12:27.426 --> 12:30.762
Sforza is dead.

12:30.830 --> 12:34.699
Florence is ripe for
the picking, Your Eminence.

12:34.767 --> 12:36.367
Trust me.

12:36.435 --> 12:38.135
You know this how?

12:38.203 --> 12:40.605
Because I have an agent
within Lorenzo's ranks.

12:42.441 --> 12:45.109
The Medicis are
throwing a carnival,

12:45.177 --> 12:48.213
in a pathetic bid to win
the people's favor.

12:48.281 --> 12:51.383
They're weak,
Your Holiness.

12:51.451 --> 12:53.419
This is your chance
to strike.

12:53.487 --> 12:56.622
Not mine, Nephew.

12:56.690 --> 12:59.626
The Lord's.

12:59.694 --> 13:02.695
There is another reason
for haste.

13:02.763 --> 13:05.131
The Turk has arrived
in Florence.

13:05.199 --> 13:08.101
He's after
the Book of Leaves.

13:14.208 --> 13:17.210
I am truly sorry.

13:21.949 --> 13:23.817
Why?

13:23.885 --> 13:27.053
Because you can't
have heard this.

13:56.950 --> 13:59.918
Do you have
the plans for the colombina or not?

13:59.986 --> 14:01.921
We do.

14:01.988 --> 14:03.889
And they're breathtaking.

14:03.957 --> 14:05.591
Then produce
these miraculous renderings

14:05.658 --> 14:07.292
and let us
evaluate them.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.027
Unfortunately...

14:09.095 --> 14:10.629
I can't.

14:10.696 --> 14:12.664
Because they
don't exist!

14:12.732 --> 14:14.666
By God, if you think
you can defraud

14:14.734 --> 14:15.901
the House
of Medici...

14:15.968 --> 14:19.338
No, no, no, they do exist,
I promise you!

14:19.405 --> 14:23.008
They're in this chest.

14:23.075 --> 14:24.876
- Open it.
- It's locked.

14:24.944 --> 14:27.579
Well, then, I'll take
my sword to it.

14:29.515 --> 14:31.483
The chest is rigged
to explode

14:31.551 --> 14:33.218
if anyone
tampers with it.

14:33.286 --> 14:35.120
Are you mad?

14:35.187 --> 14:38.357
Why would anyone engineer
such an infernal contrivance?

14:38.424 --> 14:42.795
To protect my ideas,
obviously.

14:42.862 --> 14:45.598
<i>Gentlemen, Leonardo Da Vinci.</i>

14:45.666 --> 14:48.168
<i>Ah, I've heard of you.</i>

14:48.235 --> 14:49.836
They say you're quite
the free-thinker.

14:49.904 --> 14:51.737
- You're late.
- Grape.

14:51.805 --> 14:54.774
So! The First Citizen
of Florence

14:54.842 --> 14:56.683
is desperate for us
to fashion him a colombina.

14:56.710 --> 14:58.311
'Desperate'
is a strong word.

14:58.378 --> 15:01.180
And yet it happens to be
the word I used.

15:01.248 --> 15:02.948
But let's review.

15:03.016 --> 15:05.584
Every Easter, a grand
procession makes its way

15:05.652 --> 15:07.620
through the streets
of Florence,

15:07.687 --> 15:09.355
terminating
at the cathedral.

15:09.422 --> 15:10.789
Why do you insist
on stating

15:10.857 --> 15:13.593
what every child
of three already knows?

15:13.660 --> 15:15.862
Why do you insist on
interrupting me?

15:15.930 --> 15:17.831
I have a methodology.
We can follow it.

15:17.899 --> 15:19.066
Or we can flail about.

15:22.170 --> 15:24.838
I'll take your silence as a
vote for the former. Onward.

15:24.905 --> 15:26.840
At the culmination of mass,
a mechanical dove,

15:26.908 --> 15:29.176
the colombina, is flown
from the altar on a wire.

15:29.244 --> 15:32.045
Out into the public
square it soars.

15:32.113 --> 15:34.180
It ignites a cart full
of fireworks.

15:34.248 --> 15:36.616
<i>The Republic celebrates,</i>
<i>they don masks.</i>

15:36.684 --> 15:38.852
<i>They engage in drunken</i>
<i>revelry. Now...</i>

15:38.919 --> 15:42.122
For years, the House
of Medici has contracted

15:42.189 --> 15:46.726
with inferior workshops to
produce said ceremonial dove.

15:46.794 --> 15:48.628
But, this year,

15:48.696 --> 15:51.731
if I am to understand
the politics afoot,

15:51.799 --> 15:56.535
the same shoddy pageantry

15:56.603 --> 15:57.637
just won't do.

15:57.704 --> 15:59.539
No-one's carped about
our dove before.

15:59.607 --> 16:01.474
To call your previous
efforts 'a dove'

16:01.542 --> 16:03.743
is to insult
the entire avian class.

16:03.811 --> 16:06.679
Enough! Just show us
the damn thing.

16:06.747 --> 16:08.247
All right.

16:23.097 --> 16:24.697
Ho ho ho.

16:27.968 --> 16:29.936
That is but a quarter-scale
model.

16:30.004 --> 16:33.873
There.

16:33.941 --> 16:36.242
It's a thing of beauty,
I'll grant you that.

16:36.310 --> 16:38.478
Yes, and it can be yours
for 30 florins.

16:38.546 --> 16:40.380
- 30?
- Yeah.

16:40.448 --> 16:42.215
The contract stated 12.

16:42.283 --> 16:45.218
That was for a bird that
needed a guide wire.

16:45.286 --> 16:49.589
This miracle requires
no such handicap.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.987
Your work is impressive.

17:20.055 --> 17:21.222
But the price is too steep.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.458
- 30 florins is a bargain.
- 30 florins is sodomy!

17:24.526 --> 17:26.761
Perhaps I should
be negotiating

17:26.829 --> 17:28.069
with your older
brother instead.

17:35.270 --> 17:37.171
For God's sake, Becchi,

17:37.239 --> 17:40.275
just pay the degenerate
and be done with it.

17:42.945 --> 17:45.013
You win, artista.

17:46.248 --> 17:47.582
As is customary
with commissions,

17:47.650 --> 17:51.853
we shall pay half now
and half upon completion.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.489
While we're on the subject
of commissions,

17:54.557 --> 17:58.960
I'm told that there's an open
one to paint Lucrezia Donati.

17:59.028 --> 18:02.130
Lorenzo's mistress.

18:02.198 --> 18:06.701
Stick to your whirligigs
and parlor tricks, Da Vinci.

18:06.769 --> 18:09.270
Take a lesson from Icarus.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.434
<i>So, tell me...</i>

19:14.104 --> 19:16.271
<i>..is there nothing else</i>
<i>you fear?</i>

19:28.285 --> 19:30.353
Uh! Aah! Aah!

19:32.990 --> 19:35.058
Are you all right,
Leonardo?

19:38.428 --> 19:40.596
It was just a nightmare,
Andrea.

19:40.664 --> 19:42.798
You have them all too
frequently.

19:42.866 --> 19:46.569
I'm having some issues with
my mathematics, that's all.

19:46.637 --> 19:48.705
Issues?

19:48.772 --> 19:50.473
I'm not sure...

19:50.541 --> 19:53.409
that the colombina will be
flightworthy by Easter.

19:53.477 --> 19:55.444
- But the model...
- Was a model.

19:55.512 --> 19:57.680
Once I scale up
the dimensions,

19:57.747 --> 20:00.283
the calculations don't hold.
It's annoying!

20:02.486 --> 20:04.387
Smoking opium
won't help matters.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.422
- It clears my head.
- It clouds it.

20:06.490 --> 20:09.992
What are you, my nursemaid?
I think too much. All right?

20:10.060 --> 20:13.096
I need to dull my thoughts or
I'll be eviscerated by them.

20:13.163 --> 20:15.431
I would have thought
that you would have

20:15.499 --> 20:17.267
understood that by now!

20:20.504 --> 20:23.707
The tears of the poppy have
medicinal properties.

20:23.774 --> 20:28.111
- The priests in Egypt...
- We are not in Egypt.

20:28.179 --> 20:30.614
<i>And you are no priest.</i>

20:36.220 --> 20:38.488
<i>You have a gift, Leo.</i>

20:38.556 --> 20:40.590
A kind of...genius...

20:40.658 --> 20:43.827
the likes of which
I've never seen.

20:43.895 --> 20:47.997
Because of that, people will
always seek to destroy you.

20:48.065 --> 20:50.966
Please...

20:51.034 --> 20:53.903
..don't aid them
in their endeavor.

21:25.735 --> 21:28.804
- How much for the starlings?
- Six denari apiece.

21:28.872 --> 21:31.073
I'll give you two soldi
for the lot.

21:31.141 --> 21:32.942
Are you trying
to offend me?

21:33.010 --> 21:34.377
No, if I was trying
to offend you,

21:34.444 --> 21:36.645
I'd comment on the scent
of fecal matter

21:36.713 --> 21:37.913
wafting from
your hindquarters.

21:37.981 --> 21:40.316
Do you want the soldi or not?

21:40.384 --> 21:42.985
They're my last,
I'm bored.

21:46.857 --> 21:48.825
No, I'm only interested
in the birds.

21:48.892 --> 21:51.127
Just open the cage
on my say-so.

21:51.195 --> 21:54.097
He's obsessed with flight. He
studies them for inspiration.

22:07.579 --> 22:08.646
Now.

23:01.468 --> 23:03.936
<i>Well? Did you see what you</i>
<i>were hoping to?</i>

23:04.004 --> 23:08.407
For one of my soldi back,
I just might tell you.

23:08.475 --> 23:11.410
All right.
Tell me.

23:11.478 --> 23:14.746
I saw an idiot who doesn't
know how to haggle.

23:14.814 --> 23:18.616
Look, Nico.
There she is again.

23:18.684 --> 23:20.752
<i>Look at her with Lorenzo.</i>

23:20.820 --> 23:23.654
Everyone pretending the two
of them aren't fucking.

23:23.722 --> 23:27.758
- Isn't that your father?
- Crown Prince of parasites.

23:27.826 --> 23:30.961
He serves as Lorenzo's
notary.

23:31.029 --> 23:33.798
Come on, Nico, let's
stir the pot a little.

23:33.866 --> 23:37.135
Your Magnificence!

23:37.202 --> 23:40.105
My name is Leonardo Da Vinci.
Perhaps you've heard of me?

23:40.172 --> 23:42.440
I am designing your
Easter colombina.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.542
Oh, yes.

23:44.610 --> 23:47.345
You're the eccentric
that Verrocchio employs.

23:47.413 --> 23:49.648
I'm an artist, yes,
and an anatomist

23:49.715 --> 23:51.082
and an engineer
of some note.

23:51.150 --> 23:53.485
'Extortionist' is the word
I recall using.

23:53.553 --> 23:55.554
I drive a stiff bargain,
it's true.

23:55.621 --> 23:57.322
But the fact is,
I have designed

23:57.390 --> 23:59.391
a more ambitious
series of devices

23:59.459 --> 24:01.494
that I know your
percipient mind

24:01.561 --> 24:02.762
will take an
interest in.

24:02.829 --> 24:04.997
Move along, vermin.

24:07.701 --> 24:09.535
Another time.

24:09.602 --> 24:12.171
Perhaps.

24:19.612 --> 24:22.614
I'm wounded, Nico.

24:22.682 --> 24:23.882
I need wine.

24:34.528 --> 24:36.829
How goes business,
Zoroaster?

24:36.897 --> 24:38.397
Execrable, since
the Duke's demise.

24:38.465 --> 24:40.233
These are dark times
for Florence.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.835
Case in point. Those mercenaries
flooding into town.

24:42.902 --> 24:44.636
If war does break out,

24:44.704 --> 24:46.138
they'll be the only ones
gainfully employed.

24:46.206 --> 24:48.240
Speaking of employment,

24:48.308 --> 24:50.809
a two-headed calf,
stillborn on Zitto's farm.

24:50.877 --> 24:52.344
I can procure it, if you like, for
your medical studies.

24:52.412 --> 24:53.842
The last corpse you
brought me was already

24:53.867 --> 24:55.614
decomposing by the time
I took a scalpel to it.

24:55.615 --> 24:57.049
Grave-robbing is like
fishmongering.

24:57.117 --> 24:59.318
You're at the mercy
of the day's catch.

24:59.386 --> 25:01.420
Come on. A boar sausage?

25:01.488 --> 25:03.923
You know damn well
that I am a vegetarian.

25:03.991 --> 25:06.892
- Keep hoping to corrupt you.
- Oh, I'm corruptible.

25:06.960 --> 25:09.395
I just prefer not to eat
anything with eyes.

25:09.462 --> 25:12.131
- Potatoes have eyes.
- Fuck off, Nico!

25:12.199 --> 25:14.133
<i>Maestro!</i>

25:14.200 --> 25:16.201
May I model for you again?

25:16.269 --> 25:18.237
No-one looks at
my form as you do.

25:18.305 --> 25:20.072
No-one looks at
any form as I do.

25:20.140 --> 25:21.607
Go peddle your wares
with Botticelli.

25:21.675 --> 25:22.808
He's an easy mark.

25:25.045 --> 25:27.280
Model? That boy's
nothing but a hustler

25:27.348 --> 25:28.948
and an artless
one at that.

25:29.016 --> 25:31.117
But pleasing to the eye,
nonetheless.

25:31.185 --> 25:32.986
Piss.

25:33.053 --> 25:35.354
Her. Have a gander
at these.

25:35.422 --> 25:37.490
My latest venture.

25:37.557 --> 25:39.558
They're called
tarot cards.

25:39.626 --> 25:43.296
They're used to divine
fortunes.

25:43.363 --> 25:45.683
Here. Pick one, Nico.

25:45.708 --> 25:47.565
We'll see if it squares
with your temperament.

25:47.801 --> 25:49.535
- Funny. It's a trick.
- Is it?

25:49.602 --> 25:52.204
Or am I simply channeling
the powers of The Ancients?

25:52.272 --> 25:54.307
How many women has that line
worked on, Zo?

25:54.374 --> 25:56.475
A respectable amount.
Thank you very much.

25:56.543 --> 25:58.577
And a goodly number
of gentlemen, as well.

25:58.645 --> 26:01.647
But a card can symbolize not
just one's temperament,

26:01.715 --> 26:04.284
but one's fate.

26:04.351 --> 26:06.486
Do you dare see yours?

26:13.927 --> 26:18.964
Tell me. Don't hold back.

26:19.031 --> 26:21.033
This one...

26:21.100 --> 26:24.102
represents sacrifice.

26:24.170 --> 26:28.807
A suspension between life
and death and then perhaps...

26:28.874 --> 26:32.310
..a great awakening.

26:32.378 --> 26:35.380
I'm an idiot.

26:35.447 --> 26:38.249
Those mercenaries. Florence
has no army of its own.

26:38.317 --> 26:40.719
So they're here to sell
their muscle. Right?

26:40.786 --> 26:42.893
But what if there was a more
lucrative way

26:42.918 --> 26:44.856
to traffic in the
Republic's unease?

26:44.857 --> 26:46.958
- Like what?
- I should promote myself

26:47.026 --> 26:50.195
as a military engineer,
not a painter.

26:50.262 --> 26:52.964
War has always been
the handmaiden of progress.

26:53.032 --> 26:54.766
If I want to explore
my ideas,

26:54.834 --> 26:58.069
I just need to cloak them in
the guise of Florence's defense.

26:58.137 --> 27:02.273
Why are the officers of the
night bothering that man?

27:02.341 --> 27:05.576
He's a Turk, a heathen.
Isn't that reason enough?

27:09.515 --> 27:11.215
No.

27:11.283 --> 27:13.218
No, this isn't your fight,
Leo.

27:13.285 --> 27:15.687
When's that ever
stopped me?

27:18.658 --> 27:20.626
What seems to be
the trouble here?

27:20.694 --> 27:22.328
Go back to your sketchbook,
scribbler.

27:22.396 --> 27:25.197
This isn't your concern.

27:25.265 --> 27:27.833
You see, unfortunately, um...

27:27.901 --> 27:30.002
I have this character flaw

27:30.070 --> 27:35.708
that compels me to intervene
whenever stupidity rears its head, so...

27:35.776 --> 27:37.843
You see? Cos that was stupid.

27:37.911 --> 27:39.811
Cos your man's grip was
too loose

27:39.879 --> 27:41.847
and now he finds himself

27:41.914 --> 27:47.185
staring down this handsome
spada da filo.

27:47.253 --> 27:49.287
Even more stupidity.

27:49.355 --> 27:51.723
Cos if you'd just asked
around,

27:51.791 --> 27:54.192
anyone will tell you
that I'm ambidextrous

27:54.260 --> 27:57.329
and perfectly capable
of fighting two or...

28:00.099 --> 28:02.100
..even three men
simultaneously.

28:02.168 --> 28:04.102
Bully someone else,
Dragonetti.

28:09.142 --> 28:13.278
You've made a serious
miscalculation tonight, artista.

28:13.346 --> 28:15.380
It wouldn't be
the first time.

28:25.524 --> 28:28.226
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm more than all right.

28:28.293 --> 28:33.864
I am a son of Earth
and Starry Heaven.

28:33.932 --> 28:36.768
I return to Constantinople
the day after tomorrow.

28:36.835 --> 28:40.772
But I am staying at the Inn
of the Black Swan.

28:40.840 --> 28:43.175
Come see me
before I leave...

28:45.111 --> 28:47.113
..Maestro.

28:50.017 --> 28:51.985
A bit weird.

28:52.053 --> 28:56.223
What did he give you?

28:56.291 --> 28:58.392
A tip, I think.

28:59.461 --> 29:01.061
..it was her mother.

29:02.531 --> 29:04.932
The same arse,
very different faces

29:05.000 --> 29:09.404
and, when I realized, I did
a little sip on her tit.

29:09.471 --> 29:12.740
Take him, Nico. Jesus. He'll
never make it home alone.

29:12.808 --> 29:14.475
Are you sure, Maestro?

29:14.500 --> 29:16.586
It's after curfew and there are
bound to be rogues about.

29:16.645 --> 29:18.579
- Then I'll fit right in. Go!
- Listen, Leo.

29:18.647 --> 29:20.114
What?

29:20.182 --> 29:23.684
I didn't deal you the Hanged
Man. That was all you.

29:23.752 --> 29:27.321
It was an omen. It was just
like the two-headed calf.

29:27.389 --> 29:29.290
I don't believe in omens.

29:29.357 --> 29:31.625
No. No, this is you. Go.

29:31.693 --> 29:33.294
Go!

29:47.310 --> 29:50.246
I know it's you, Dragonetti.

29:50.314 --> 29:52.948
Did you not learn your lesson
earlier?

29:58.721 --> 30:00.122
Ah.

30:00.990 --> 30:04.560
I guess you did learn.

30:10.033 --> 30:11.534
That's enough.

30:13.637 --> 30:15.471
I should have known.

30:15.539 --> 30:17.707
People are talking about you.

30:17.774 --> 30:20.911
And not in
a positive light.

30:20.979 --> 30:23.847
I couldn't care less what
they're saying about me.

30:23.915 --> 30:27.084
I care!

30:27.152 --> 30:29.587
I'll not have you tarnishing
our family's name

30:29.655 --> 30:34.758
with your flippant tone and
your vulgar attempts at self-promotion.

30:34.826 --> 30:36.861
Perhaps you should
disown me, then.

30:36.928 --> 30:38.295
You're my first-born.

30:38.363 --> 30:41.231
And much as I may wish
to disavow you,

30:41.299 --> 30:43.501
our reputations
are intertwined.

30:43.568 --> 30:46.070
First-born?

30:47.272 --> 30:49.239
You say that as if...

30:49.307 --> 30:52.809
My wife, Margherita...

30:52.877 --> 30:58.081
..bore me a son
this past week.

30:58.148 --> 31:01.651
A legitimate heir.

31:01.719 --> 31:04.654
Well, my condolences to him.

31:04.722 --> 31:08.624
I wonder how long
it will take him to curse his lineage.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.590
As a bastard, your rank

31:10.615 --> 31:12.795
within the social order has
been rigidly defined.

31:12.797 --> 31:16.132
You should endeavor
to remain within it.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.535
Stay away from the Medicis,
Leonardo.

31:18.602 --> 31:21.237
- I'll not warn you again.
- I'll wager you will.

31:21.305 --> 31:23.840
Why do you have to make
this so difficult?

31:23.908 --> 31:26.410
It's my nature!
I see things as they are,

31:26.477 --> 31:28.512
not as they might be.

31:33.651 --> 31:35.286
You...

31:35.353 --> 31:38.089
are a petty man.

31:41.694 --> 31:45.030
And...you will never
achieve greatness.

31:48.367 --> 31:50.368
Whereas I...

31:50.436 --> 31:53.571
I already have.

31:58.444 --> 32:01.679
You're kneeling
in a dungeon.

32:01.747 --> 32:04.683
About to be hit again
and again.

32:04.750 --> 32:09.354
By men who know
how to hit.

32:09.422 --> 32:13.058
That's what you've achieved,
Leonardo.

32:22.836 --> 32:25.204
Beat him for another hour,

32:25.271 --> 32:27.272
then toss him back
onto the street

32:27.340 --> 32:29.742
with the rest
of the garbage.

32:33.046 --> 32:34.680
Hold out the scribbler's
hand.

32:43.856 --> 32:46.790
To be fair, you actually look
more wretched than I, so...

32:46.858 --> 32:49.326
well done.

32:49.394 --> 32:51.562
Perhaps you should see
a physician.

32:51.629 --> 32:53.096
I'm fine.

32:53.164 --> 32:56.466
Oh, they're executing
a Jew today.

32:56.534 --> 32:58.669
Apparently, they caught him breaking into
the book shop on the Via Dei Librai.

32:58.736 --> 33:00.637
It should be good sport.

33:00.705 --> 33:03.640
I'm not sure a man's death
should be characterized as sport.

33:03.708 --> 33:05.792
This fucking spot is too sunny.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.909
Can't we move over
into the shade?

33:06.910 --> 33:08.711
- No.
- Why?

33:08.779 --> 33:11.214
Because every morning,
at precisely this time,

33:11.282 --> 33:14.617
Lucrezia Donati comes to this
exact spot to purchase...

33:14.685 --> 33:16.285
flowers.

33:16.353 --> 33:19.022
<i>There.</i>

33:22.660 --> 33:27.063
She's appealing, I'll grant
you that, but...

33:27.131 --> 33:29.999
..I'd rather bed that old
toothless hag over there.

33:30.067 --> 33:33.102
Now you're just being
contrary.

33:33.170 --> 33:35.572
It takes no great skill
to fuck a pretty face.

33:35.639 --> 33:38.741
But a truly ugly woman, that
actually requires discipline

33:38.809 --> 33:40.529
and, let me tell you,
my friend, done right,

33:40.544 --> 33:42.611
a transcendent
experience.

34:05.703 --> 34:08.670
Nico, run this over to her.

34:08.739 --> 34:10.739
Make sure she knows
where it's come from.

34:12.976 --> 34:15.245
What the devil
are you up to, Leo?

34:38.135 --> 34:40.203
She wants to speak
with you.

34:40.270 --> 34:42.505
Uh-huh? Well,
tell her I'm busy.

34:42.572 --> 34:44.341
You're seriously
not turning her down?

34:44.408 --> 34:47.444
Tell her, Nico.
Timing is all.

34:51.216 --> 34:53.016
He can't right now.

34:56.255 --> 34:59.725
Behold, a criminal
in our midst!

34:59.792 --> 35:01.827
A Jew, no less!

35:01.894 --> 35:06.098
<i>Watch him dance!</i>
<i>Watch him dangle!</i>

35:06.166 --> 35:08.334
<i>Bring your fruit</i>
<i>and small stones!</i>

35:08.402 --> 35:10.937
<i>God protect the Republic</i>
<i>of Florence!</i>

35:16.910 --> 35:19.245
I am a son of Earth
and Starry Heaven.

35:21.748 --> 35:23.548
I am thirsty.

35:23.616 --> 35:25.584
Please, give me
something to drink

35:25.651 --> 35:27.385
from the Fountain
of Memory.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.602
<i>Are you all right, Maestro?</i>

35:46.672 --> 35:48.373
I need to leave.

35:54.747 --> 35:58.016
Is there a foreigner staying
here, a Turkish man?

35:58.083 --> 36:00.018
He said you could find him
at the Roman ruins,

36:00.086 --> 36:01.653
north of town.

36:46.835 --> 36:48.903
Will you smoke with me,
Da Vinci?

36:48.970 --> 36:51.706
Well, that depends
on what's in the pipe.

37:06.088 --> 37:09.057
History is a lie that has
been honed like a weapon

37:09.124 --> 37:11.859
by people who have
suppressed the truth.

37:11.926 --> 37:13.894
Centuries from now,
your own history

37:13.962 --> 37:16.697
will also be suppressed.

37:16.765 --> 37:18.899
How could you possibly
know that?

37:18.967 --> 37:22.236
You have heard the phrase
'Time is a river'?

37:22.304 --> 37:24.305
What most fail to grasp

37:24.373 --> 37:26.974
is that the river
is circular.

37:27.042 --> 37:28.810
<i>One man's death...</i>

37:28.877 --> 37:31.646
<i>opens a doorway</i>
<i>to the birth of the next.</i>

37:33.081 --> 37:36.049
I saw a man
executed today.

37:36.117 --> 37:37.084
He said something to me.

37:37.151 --> 37:39.319
- I am...
- A son of Earth

37:39.387 --> 37:41.355
and Starry Heaven.

37:41.423 --> 37:43.391
I am thirsty.

37:43.459 --> 37:45.727
Please, give me
something to drink

37:45.795 --> 37:48.263
from the Fountain
of Memory.

37:49.699 --> 37:51.132
It is an invocation.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.601
A way for members
of our fraternity

37:52.668 --> 37:53.768
to recognize one another.

37:53.836 --> 37:55.871
I'm not a member
of your fraternity.

37:55.938 --> 37:57.339
Are you sure?

38:00.043 --> 38:02.978
This temple was once
a place of worship

38:03.046 --> 38:05.146
for a religion
that originated

38:05.214 --> 38:08.149
long before Christ.

38:08.217 --> 38:11.252
We are known
as the Sons of Mithras.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.120
Much of what you call
'progress'

38:13.188 --> 38:15.489
has simply been a matter
of remembering

38:15.557 --> 38:17.325
what was once forgotten.

38:17.392 --> 38:19.360
This knowledge
was set down

38:19.428 --> 38:23.398
in a compendium known
as the Book of Leaves.

38:23.466 --> 38:25.867
Recently, certain
clues have surfaced

38:25.935 --> 38:28.203
regarding the Book's
location.

38:28.271 --> 38:31.039
Avraham ben Yosef was
following those clues

38:31.107 --> 38:35.210
when he was apprehended
and put to death.

38:35.278 --> 38:38.213
<i>Perhaps you have heard</i>
<i>of the Secret Archives</i>

38:38.281 --> 38:40.849
the Vatican has assembled?

38:40.917 --> 38:45.086
Its curator is a man
called Lupo Mercuri.

38:45.154 --> 38:47.122
A fallen son of Mithras.

38:47.190 --> 38:52.160
Where we seek to disseminate
and preserve knowledge.

38:52.228 --> 38:54.830
They seek to alter
and suppress it.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.832
I still don't understand

38:56.900 --> 39:00.035
what any of this
has to do with me.

39:00.103 --> 39:03.172
What do you know...
about your mother?

39:03.240 --> 39:05.674
Almost nothing.

39:06.409 --> 39:08.444
She... She disappeared.

39:08.511 --> 39:13.615
- She was a servant girl.
- She was a slave.

39:13.683 --> 39:17.452
Taken from Constantinople
against her will.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.121
Do you remember...

39:19.188 --> 39:22.625
an incident that occurred
in your childhood?

39:26.362 --> 39:27.963
You have suppressed it.

39:33.370 --> 39:35.971
I was a boy in Vinci.

39:38.375 --> 39:42.378
<i>I'd been sent to fetch some</i>
<i>sheep that had wandered off.</i>

39:42.446 --> 39:44.480
I found a cave.

39:47.184 --> 39:48.985
I was scared to go inside,
but...

39:50.587 --> 39:52.955
But I was curious.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.426
So I ventured in.

39:58.028 --> 40:03.299
The next hours...are blank.

40:03.367 --> 40:07.236
I remember...

40:07.304 --> 40:10.940
..stumbling out.

40:11.007 --> 40:13.309
My hands and face...

40:16.212 --> 40:18.180
..were covered in blood.

40:18.248 --> 40:20.216
And somehow...

40:20.283 --> 40:23.286
I knew it wasn't my own.

40:26.924 --> 40:28.725
One day...

40:28.792 --> 40:32.395
you will sip from
the Fountain of Memory...

40:32.462 --> 40:37.266
..and learn more of what
occurred in that cave.

40:37.334 --> 40:39.569
When that day comes,
we will meet again.

40:39.636 --> 40:42.571
What do I do till then?

40:42.639 --> 40:44.807
Search for
the Book of Leaves.

40:44.875 --> 40:48.677
Fate has chosen you,
Leonardo.

40:48.745 --> 40:53.416
- I don't believe in fate.
- Then believe in yourself.

40:53.484 --> 40:55.851
Well, where do I start
my search, then?

40:55.919 --> 41:00.423
With the hanged man,
the seat of the soul.

41:00.490 --> 41:02.759
He's already opened
the door for you.

41:02.826 --> 41:05.795
And my mother?

41:05.863 --> 41:10.401
She will be for you
on the other side.

41:12.437 --> 41:14.404
All you have to do...

41:14.472 --> 41:17.040
is enter.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.985
Maestro? Maestro?
Can you hear me?

41:29.053 --> 41:32.155
Maestro!

41:32.223 --> 41:34.658
We've been looking for you
since last night. What happened?

41:40.230 --> 41:42.064
The Turk was here.

41:45.602 --> 41:49.004
There was...
There was a statue.

41:49.072 --> 41:50.673
An altar.

41:50.740 --> 41:52.708
Must have weighed a ton.

41:52.776 --> 41:55.377
This place has been empty
for centuries, Leo.

41:55.445 --> 41:57.212
<i>Maestro, the Officers</i>
<i>of the Night</i>

41:57.280 --> 41:58.514
<i>have been searching</i>
<i>for you.</i>

41:58.581 --> 42:01.250
They say Lorenzo Medici
himself has asked for you.

42:43.060 --> 42:45.061
Leonardo di ser Piero...

42:45.128 --> 42:46.829
Da Vinci.

42:48.365 --> 42:51.768
I am told you are
my notary's bastard son.

42:53.637 --> 42:55.037
I am.

42:55.105 --> 42:57.440
<i>I'm also told that you are</i>
<i>a troublemaker,</i>

42:57.508 --> 43:00.543
<i>you are arrogant,</i>
<i>impolitic...</i>

43:00.611 --> 43:01.811
<i>..and utterly</i>
<i>incapable</i>

43:01.879 --> 43:04.113
<i>of keeping your opinions</i>
<i>to yourself.</i>

43:04.181 --> 43:08.351
Arrogance implies that
I exaggerate my own worth.

43:08.419 --> 43:09.920
<i>I don't.</i>

43:13.057 --> 43:16.060
My mistress, Lucrezia,

43:16.128 --> 43:17.629
seems to think that you have

43:17.696 --> 43:20.465
a singular talent
for portraiture.

43:20.533 --> 43:24.503
She insisted that you and
none other be the one to...

43:24.571 --> 43:26.672
capture her beauty.

43:26.739 --> 43:28.840
I'd say she has
a discerning eye, then.

43:28.908 --> 43:31.343
A warning, sir.
The man has a reputation

43:31.411 --> 43:34.346
for taking many commissions,
but finishing few.

43:34.414 --> 43:38.050
I wrestle with details.
I bore easily.

43:38.117 --> 43:40.118
Call it a character flaw.

43:40.186 --> 43:42.821
Well, with this commission,

43:42.889 --> 43:44.356
you'd be wise
to overcome it.

43:44.424 --> 43:46.725
When it comes
to Miss Donati,

43:46.793 --> 43:49.895
boredom is the last thing
I fear.

43:54.067 --> 43:56.468
I'll have your father draw up
a contract then.

43:56.536 --> 43:59.304
Sir, if I may, I have
a few other designs...

44:04.778 --> 44:06.041
I have some designs

44:06.066 --> 44:08.237
that I think you might be
interested in.

44:09.249 --> 44:12.685
This will greatly increase
your gunner's rate of firepower.

44:12.753 --> 44:14.754
So, while the top rack's
being fired,

44:14.822 --> 44:16.923
the rack below that one
can be loaded

44:16.990 --> 44:19.525
and the rack below that one
is allowed to cool.

44:19.593 --> 44:21.961
The cannons are arranged
in a fan, which -

44:22.029 --> 44:24.697
- That will be enough.
- This is an armored cart.

44:24.765 --> 44:28.067
Propulsion is achieved by two
men, who are housed within.

44:28.135 --> 44:30.704
They operate cranks, which
rotate the wheels.

44:30.772 --> 44:33.207
Cannons can be mounted around
the perimeter of the cart.

44:44.887 --> 44:46.988
It's a flying machine.

44:47.056 --> 44:49.090
It's modeled after the
articulated wings of a bat.

44:49.158 --> 44:51.125
Madness.
If man were meant to fly...

44:51.193 --> 44:53.261
He would have been born
with wings, yes.

44:53.328 --> 44:54.896
But a similar assertion could
have been made prior

44:54.963 --> 44:56.163
to the invention
of gunpowder--

44:56.198 --> 45:00.835
or any other invention
conceived since fire.

45:00.902 --> 45:03.904
I believe man will fly
and I base this assumption

45:03.972 --> 45:05.705
on the fact that God
has blessed us

45:05.773 --> 45:08.642
with minds that are
capable of imagining it.

45:08.709 --> 45:12.647
Anything that can be dreamt
of will eventually be built.

45:13.815 --> 45:17.151
Anyone who says
otherwise is a fool.

45:18.554 --> 45:20.956
What exactly do you propose?

45:21.023 --> 45:23.158
I wish to be employed...

45:23.226 --> 45:26.461
as a military engineer.

45:26.529 --> 45:28.496
I am a humanist,
Da Vinci.

45:28.564 --> 45:30.965
I have no interest
in waging war.

45:31.033 --> 45:34.236
And yet your humanism
is precisely why war will happen.

45:34.304 --> 45:36.272
Florence has
no standing army.

45:36.340 --> 45:38.307
Nor does Rome.

45:38.375 --> 45:40.277
Necessarily...

45:40.345 --> 45:43.113
you've both made alliances
with states that do.

45:43.180 --> 45:45.148
Florence with Milan,

45:45.216 --> 45:48.318
and Rome with Naples.

45:48.386 --> 45:51.788
Sforza's death has up-ended
the game board.

45:51.856 --> 45:54.458
You need weapons of your own,
Your Magnificence.

45:59.663 --> 46:03.532
I will give you
a modest stipend.

46:03.600 --> 46:05.567
To see whether these...

46:05.635 --> 46:09.004
contraptions of yours
can actually be realized.

46:09.072 --> 46:11.507
- Shall we say 100 florins?
- 50.

46:11.575 --> 46:14.343
If you haggle any further,
I'll cut out your tongue.

46:14.411 --> 46:16.645
<i>As you say, sir.</i>

46:16.713 --> 46:18.581
Thank you.

46:18.649 --> 46:22.152
You used Lucrezia to gain
access to me, didn't you?

46:22.219 --> 46:24.288
I utilize any device
at my disposal,

46:24.355 --> 46:26.323
in order to realize
my goals.

46:26.391 --> 46:28.058
Clever,

46:28.126 --> 46:30.794
but I'd caution you not to be
too clever around me.

46:30.862 --> 46:32.863
Clockwork loses
its luster,

46:32.930 --> 46:38.034
once one glimpses the gears
beneath its face.

46:38.102 --> 46:39.436
Point taken.

46:55.253 --> 46:57.220
Is there a problem?

46:57.288 --> 46:59.289
None at all, sir.

46:59.357 --> 47:01.725
Good day.

47:12.003 --> 47:15.539
- Congratulations, Leonardo.
- Word travels fast.

47:15.607 --> 47:17.508
Ah, there are no secrets
in Florence.

47:17.575 --> 47:19.443
<i>How the devil</i>
<i>did you do it?</i>

47:19.510 --> 47:21.211
Oh, he played on
a woman's vanity.

47:21.279 --> 47:23.680
Your stratagem has become
clear, you bastard.

47:23.748 --> 47:26.416
A bastard of
the highest order.

47:26.484 --> 47:28.518
Ha! Drink up everybody.

47:28.586 --> 47:33.390
Then get back to work. We've
got a colombina to build!

47:33.458 --> 47:35.659
The Jew that was hanged, I want
you to unearth his body.

47:35.660 --> 47:37.060
I need to examine it.

47:37.128 --> 47:38.929
And my compensation?

47:38.997 --> 47:41.364
Well, that depends
how fresh the corpse is.

47:41.432 --> 47:43.367
Ah, well, then,
I'd best get digging.

48:33.315 --> 48:36.150
Ah, here's the Pazzi clan.

48:36.218 --> 48:39.187
With their schemer Francesco
and old man Jacopo.

48:39.254 --> 48:41.855
<i>Probably the oldest family</i>
<i>in Florence,</i>

48:41.923 --> 48:44.224
<i>definitely the most ornery.</i>

48:52.233 --> 48:56.736
The Pazzi family entrusts
Lorenzo de Medici

48:56.804 --> 48:58.772
with this new fire,

48:58.839 --> 49:02.909
struck on stones from the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher.

49:02.977 --> 49:04.978
As is our right.

49:05.046 --> 49:07.014
Granted to our ancestor
for his actions

49:07.081 --> 49:08.582
during the First Crusade.

49:27.701 --> 49:30.269
<i>The colombina</i>
<i>is about to fly.</i>

49:37.644 --> 49:41.947
<i>Welcome, all</i>
<i>of you, into God's home.</i>

51:16.243 --> 51:20.213
<i>The flames of</i>
<i>the phoenix suit you well.</i>

51:20.280 --> 51:21.881
Tell me, truly,

51:21.949 --> 51:25.751
are you always this wistful
with the whores you bed?

51:25.819 --> 51:28.221
Oh, you are no whore,
Signora.

51:29.590 --> 51:32.992
We need not continue
this pretence any longer, Miss Donati.

51:33.060 --> 51:36.062
I knew it was you from the
moment you approached me.

51:36.129 --> 51:38.097
How did you know?

51:38.165 --> 51:41.067
I sketched you.

51:42.536 --> 51:46.539
Your features, your form,
your bearing.

51:46.607 --> 51:49.743
The more salient question...

51:49.810 --> 51:53.279
..is why would a noblewoman

51:53.347 --> 51:56.482
risk her reputation
on a lowly artisan?

51:58.753 --> 52:02.189
Well, isn't that the point
of a carnival?

52:02.256 --> 52:05.258
To pretend, for a night, that
you're someone you're not.

52:05.325 --> 52:07.794
No, I think there's more
to it than that, yeah.

52:07.861 --> 52:09.128
Tell me, then.

52:11.132 --> 52:13.099
You were intrigued
by my sketch.

52:13.167 --> 52:14.768
Yeah, so...

52:16.738 --> 52:20.441
You felt that it captured
an aspect of yourself

52:20.509 --> 52:23.578
that remains hidden
from your husband,

52:23.646 --> 52:26.181
and from your lover,
Lorenzo.

52:28.851 --> 52:32.787
The only time
you see this aspect...

52:32.855 --> 52:33.888
..is on the
rare occasions

52:33.956 --> 52:35.290
that you glimpse yourself
in the mirror,

52:35.357 --> 52:39.461
and you find a stranger
staring back at you.

52:42.599 --> 52:44.333
You knew I'd seek you out,
then.

52:46.003 --> 52:48.504
Well...

52:48.572 --> 52:51.674
Hey, I try to work out
what motivates people

52:51.742 --> 52:54.978
and then I proceed
accordingly.

52:55.045 --> 52:56.045
You manipulate them.

52:56.113 --> 52:57.480
No. I prefer to think
of it as gently

52:57.548 --> 52:59.082
redirecting
their trajectories.

53:18.603 --> 53:22.006
<i>Lorenzo was quite taken with</i>
<i>your designs.</i>

53:22.074 --> 53:24.476
<i>Well, may I see</i>
<i>one of these marvels?</i>

53:38.425 --> 53:40.392
What is it?

53:40.460 --> 53:42.961
It's a device for slowing
one's rate of descent.

53:43.029 --> 53:44.662
- Oh.
- Yeah.

53:44.730 --> 53:48.133
And under what circumstances
would I possibly have use for this?

53:50.402 --> 53:52.803
Say that you were trapped
in a fortress.

53:52.871 --> 53:56.807
- A fortress?
- That had been breached.

53:56.875 --> 53:59.376
You could strap yourself
into this...

53:59.444 --> 54:01.912
and you'd safely float down
to freedom.

54:01.980 --> 54:03.580
Oh, thank goodness.

54:07.452 --> 54:10.554
It would appear Lorenzo's
interest in you was justified.

54:10.622 --> 54:13.157
But tell me.

54:13.224 --> 54:17.061
I have risked my reputation
by sleeping with you.

54:17.129 --> 54:19.030
You've risked more.

54:19.098 --> 54:22.166
Perhaps even death.

54:22.234 --> 54:25.504
And to what do you ascribe
my reckless behavior, then?

54:25.572 --> 54:26.739
Love.

54:26.806 --> 54:28.474
Don't be absurd.

54:28.541 --> 54:30.843
You saw me, you drew me,
you fell in love.

54:30.911 --> 54:32.711
It's as simple as that.

54:32.779 --> 54:35.647
Add in the fact that I am
forbidden fruit...

54:37.449 --> 54:39.950
..and your fate was sealed.

54:44.289 --> 54:47.157
You're the third person this
week to lecture me on fate.

54:47.225 --> 54:50.761
Well, perhaps it's time
you started listening.

54:50.829 --> 54:52.663
Now...

54:58.003 --> 55:01.106
Fuck me again,
Leonardo.

55:01.173 --> 55:05.177
This time, remember...

55:07.313 --> 55:10.315
..you're not the only one
capable of manipulation.

55:22.895 --> 55:24.596
The Secret Archives are open

55:24.664 --> 55:28.834
only to his Holiness'
closest advisors.

55:28.901 --> 55:30.135
For obvious reasons,

55:30.160 --> 55:32.810
we can't have you parading
through the front door.

55:33.406 --> 55:36.008
Ah.

55:36.076 --> 55:39.879
How rude of me.

55:39.946 --> 55:42.982
I promised you
your payment first.

55:49.723 --> 55:52.624
I take it you're satisfied?

56:17.218 --> 56:19.186
Your Eminence,

56:19.254 --> 56:21.254
I bring news from Florence.

56:21.322 --> 56:23.290
Get on with it, then.

56:23.358 --> 56:26.359
A new player
has entered the stage.

56:26.427 --> 56:30.296
An artist known as
Leonardo Da Vinci.

56:30.364 --> 56:34.467
The Medicis have employed him
to design siege weapons.

56:34.535 --> 56:38.004
Artists are as common
as court jesters.

56:38.072 --> 56:41.708
I see no reason why this news
should concern us.

56:41.775 --> 56:45.378
This artist is different.
His ideas are...

56:45.446 --> 56:46.412
unusual,

56:46.480 --> 56:48.448
revolutionary.

56:48.515 --> 56:51.518
My agent in Florence.

56:58.659 --> 57:01.361
You trust your intelligence
to a woman?

57:01.429 --> 57:03.729
When one seeks
to convey a message,

57:03.797 --> 57:07.600
I prefer to use vessels
others would readily dismiss.

57:07.668 --> 57:10.637
If I am not mistaken,
you are Lupo Mercuri,

57:10.704 --> 57:12.372
Curator of the
Secret Archives.

57:12.439 --> 57:14.541
- What of it?
- It may interest you to know

57:14.608 --> 57:16.743
that Da Vinci has made
contact...

57:16.810 --> 57:18.911
with the Turk.

57:18.979 --> 57:23.182
He's searching for something
called the Book of Leaves.

57:24.785 --> 57:27.988
It would appear the Turk has
found a new champion.

57:30.491 --> 57:32.492
Continue watching him.

57:32.560 --> 57:34.594
See if he can be co-opted.

57:34.662 --> 57:37.363
And if he can't?

57:37.431 --> 57:39.398
Then Da Vinci
will be consumed

57:39.466 --> 57:42.469
in the fiery
sorrows of hell.

57:42.536 --> 57:46.006
Along with the rest
of God's enemies.
