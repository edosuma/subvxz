00:06.705 --> 00:08.540
Narrator:
Previously on rogue...

00:08.542 --> 00:10.275
People call me
a conspiracy nut.

00:10.277 --> 00:11.377
He just wanted
to talk about some

00:11.379 --> 00:12.945
Real estate deal I closed.

00:12.947 --> 00:15.547
Hutchings has been
talking to everyone
involved in that deal.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.149
He's got shit on all of us.

00:17.151 --> 00:20.786
Benny: Adam hutchings,
2005, ford focus,
towed three weeks ago.

00:20.788 --> 00:21.987
What the fuck!

00:21.989 --> 00:24.656
Hutchings was a reporter,
chasing a story.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.158
This is what they do.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.160
Harper: What is that?
Patrick: It's urban art.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.062
You wanna go? Go.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.764
I'll say goodbye
to your dad for you.

00:33.733 --> 00:35.034
Did sam make that for you?

00:35.036 --> 00:37.202
He made it on his
first day of school...

00:37.204 --> 00:38.604
Marlon:  <i>So, leo,</i>
<i>what is it that you do?</i>

00:38.838 --> 00:40.706
-I'm a connector.
-What do you connect?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.641
-He didn't tell you
'bout our business?
-Nah.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.043
'cause we're looking
for investors.

00:44.045 --> 00:46.045
You know, partnership's...
It's expensive.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.579
Talia:  <i>How expensive?</i>
<i>Leo: </i> <i>Thirty.</i>

00:47.581 --> 00:49.882
Talia:  <i>Thirty grand?</i>
<i>I can get that shit easy.</i>

00:51.017 --> 00:53.452
This is... Oh, yeah.
Okay, cool.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.988
General howard's building
a case against you.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.189
-(clears throat)
-what?

00:57.191 --> 00:58.524
He seems pretty
motivated, too.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.259
He sent me across the country
to do it.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.693
He's turned on you, marty.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.495
He must know about the guns.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.364
I'm not here
voluntarily, marty.

01:05.366 --> 01:06.999
What the fuck does that mean?

01:07.001 --> 01:09.268
It means, I think that
you and I could be
valuable to each other.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.070
Grace:  <i>The general's</i>
<i>fucking his biographer.</i>

01:11.072 --> 01:13.005
-That's original.
-Yeah.
They just left the hotel.

01:13.007 --> 01:15.174
So, I'm gonna check the room,
see what I can find.

01:19.946 --> 01:21.180
(shouting)

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074

01:33.026 --> 01:35.094
(theme song playing)

02:32.986 --> 02:34.286
Harper: All right.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.488
So why would sophie hale
pretend not to know ethan?

02:36.490 --> 02:38.690
Maybe she wasn't pretending.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.325
They work at
the same law firm,

02:40.327 --> 02:41.994
How could they not
know each other?

02:42.462 --> 02:43.996
Who's that?

02:45.331 --> 02:46.498
What's her name?

02:47.367 --> 02:48.500
Fine.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.835
All I'm saying,
it's not outside

02:49.837 --> 02:51.170
The realm of possibility

02:51.172 --> 02:53.105
That sophie and ethan
never met.

02:53.107 --> 02:54.673
Then why did she
shut up all of a sudden

02:54.675 --> 02:56.074
When I brought up hutchings?

02:56.543 --> 02:58.577
-(sighs)
-speak.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.680
Well, it's just sometimes
you can come off

03:01.682 --> 03:03.382
A little strong.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.783
-What?
-Look, deak,

03:04.785 --> 03:06.518
You know I love you.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.886
And given the opportunity,

03:07.888 --> 03:10.522
I would be the caring
and tender lover

03:10.524 --> 03:12.124
And partner
you so richly deserve...

03:12.126 --> 03:13.192
Suck my dick, patty.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.360
...But sometimes
during interrogations

03:15.362 --> 03:17.596
You can make people
feel a little... (chuckles)

03:18.164 --> 03:20.532
Well, reticent.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.535
-Reticent?
-Just sometimes.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.737
Hey, any of this
fitting together yet?

03:25.739 --> 03:27.306
Still free associating, sir.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.141
What's your narrative
on kelly?

03:29.143 --> 03:31.009
His father said
he works for marty stein.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.844
Seems to be the common
thread in all of this.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.080
Guy's got his greedy
fucking fingers in everything.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.382
I lost my best assistant
us attorney to him last year.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.952
Can't imagine why anyone would
want to leave you, angela.

03:40.853 --> 03:43.055
We've been running through
hutchings' call sheet.

03:43.057 --> 03:44.256
Seems that he was in contact

03:44.258 --> 03:45.524
With a couple
of stein's lawyers.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.725
Got anything specific?

03:46.727 --> 03:48.560
Well, we talked to
sophie hale yesterday,

03:48.562 --> 03:50.229
But there wasn't much
going on there.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.396
So we're gonna see
if we have better luck

03:51.398 --> 03:53.098
With one of her colleagues
this afternoon.

03:53.766 --> 03:55.334
And you think
hutchings' death is somehow

03:55.336 --> 03:56.501
Going to lead us back
to the kings?

03:56.503 --> 03:57.736
At worst,
they were triggermen.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.404
At best, co-conspirators.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.505
Angela: Forgive my ignorance.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.675
If the kings wanted
hutchings dead,

04:03.677 --> 04:04.910
Wouldn't it have
been a lot easier

04:04.912 --> 04:06.445
To just shoot him in the head?

04:09.716 --> 04:13.785
Yes, but then
what the hell would we
do around here all day?

04:16.055 --> 04:17.755
Keep us looped.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.897
-Maryellen.
-What?

04:25.899 --> 04:27.266
The secretary.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.369
Maryellen.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.376
(thunder rumbling)

04:41.781 --> 04:43.315
General howard:
I swear to god.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.317
This fucking city.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.219
I only have a minute.

04:47.221 --> 04:48.820
I think we should
cut ties with kelly.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.988
All right.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.124
"all right"?

04:52.126 --> 04:54.526
Explain that
thought process to me.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.595
He's unpredictable.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.730
He seems more like
a dull loner to me.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.932
He's opportunistic.
He's short-sighted.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.801
And he thinks he's smarter
than everyone around him.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.570
(sighs) eight years
in the military will do that.

05:06.773 --> 05:09.374
I am worried about
what he'll do next.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.677
Were you clear with him?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.480
God damn it.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.916
There are better ways
into marty stein.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.484
What about the father?

05:20.153 --> 05:21.253
I'm sorry?

05:21.255 --> 05:22.721
The father. George kelly.

05:23.589 --> 05:24.856
What about him?

05:24.858 --> 05:27.192
Well, ethan plays fast
and loose with his own life.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.695
What about his dad's?

05:30.496 --> 05:31.730
(sighing)

05:31.931 --> 05:33.565
It's hard to say.

05:34.033 --> 05:36.435
I suppose there's some
incentive to be found there.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.502
General howard: Good.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.504
-Do that then.
-Sir.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.841
If we stop now,

05:42.843 --> 05:45.043
We'll have to start over
with someone else.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.513
-Yes, sir.
-I don't want that.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.015
Do you want that?

05:51.818 --> 05:54.286
-No, sir.
-It's your call, lloyd.

05:55.321 --> 05:57.189
I value your opinion.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.060
I'll pick up the father today.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.096
Hold him until
we're done with ethan.

06:05.398 --> 06:08.467
I always said you were
too soft for this work.

06:14.741 --> 06:15.907
Yes, sir.

06:19.746 --> 06:21.613
(exhales deeply)

06:31.591 --> 06:33.892
Hey, grace,
where the hell you at?

06:33.894 --> 06:36.395
The hotel just said
you checked out.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.063
Call me back.

06:41.701 --> 06:43.368
She's right, you know...

06:43.370 --> 06:44.503
Guthrie.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.171
Yeah, what's she right about?

06:46.173 --> 06:48.473
This whole conspiracy
you've cooked up.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.809
You don't like it?
It's a big fucking task force.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.944
Whoa! Jesus.

06:53.546 --> 06:56.681
I'm just saying.
You might want to
take a step back.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.417
Might be a different line
to follow.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.118
Well, I'm open
for suggestions.

07:14.033 --> 07:16.668
I need an accent piece
for our new office.

07:21.474 --> 07:22.741
Show me.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.242
It needs to be classy.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.377
Delrosario: Of course, ma'am.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.612
But also wild and bizarre.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.381
-Obscene, really.
-Yes, ma'am.

07:29.383 --> 07:31.883
It should bleed
a primordial eroticism.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.285
Desperate. Violent.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.086
Yet tempered... (gasping)

07:35.088 --> 07:37.522
Oh, my god!

07:37.790 --> 07:39.458
Yes, this is perhaps

07:39.460 --> 07:42.294
One of our less
successful pieces.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.829
Margo: Are you kidding me?

07:43.831 --> 07:46.631
My bosses are going
to love this.

07:47.233 --> 07:48.700
I'll take it.

07:52.605 --> 07:55.907
This is, like,
some serious art shit.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.209
(sniffs)

07:57.477 --> 07:59.044
It's vulgar.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.481
-It's freakish.
-Mmm-hmm.

08:02.483 --> 08:04.316
Mmm-hmm. But elegant.

08:05.651 --> 08:06.852
Yeah.

08:10.923 --> 08:12.824
I opened
the chicago office first,

08:12.826 --> 08:15.327
Then new york, then milan.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.963
-You bitch.
-Complete bitch.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.232
"executive assistant
to the ceo."

08:20.600 --> 08:22.267
-Wow.
-Hannah: Damn.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.936
Margo, you're, like,
inspirational.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.104
You're so lucky.

08:26.772 --> 08:28.540
My bosses are
really hands-off.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.009
I'm basically
running the company.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.311
Excuse me, miss.
You'll have to come with us.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.513
Margo: What?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.549
I didn't know
it was counterfeit.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.384
It's not like
I'm running the company.

08:39.385 --> 08:41.219
You seemed to be
spending it in a hurry.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.953
It was almost as if
you were trying to unload it

08:42.956 --> 08:44.689
-Before anyone noticed.
-I told you.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.325
My bosses just sent me out
to set up the company.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.593
They just gave me the cash.

08:49.161 --> 08:50.929
And do these bosses
have a name?

08:52.398 --> 08:53.965
(knocking on door)

08:58.337 --> 08:59.638
Leo taylor?

08:59.640 --> 09:00.772
Yeah.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.108
The fuck you need?

09:07.880 --> 09:09.548
What is this,
marty's commissary?

09:09.550 --> 09:11.082
You guys allowed
to eat anywhere else?

09:11.084 --> 09:14.052
What can I say?
I didn't want you guys
coming by the office.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.353
I assume you have
something to ask me.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.488
Harper: Yeah.

09:16.490 --> 09:18.056
Why is it when lawyers die,

09:18.058 --> 09:19.691
They're buried 20 feet
under the ground?

09:19.693 --> 09:21.793
Because deep down
they really are nice guys.

09:22.194 --> 09:23.728
-(chuckles)
-heard 'em all.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.997
-I thought about
becoming a lawyer.
-Oh, yeah?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.699
But then you realized
you didn't care for xanax.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.335
No. My dad died.
I couldn't afford tuition.

09:35.007 --> 09:36.441
So, I've got about 20 minutes.

09:36.842 --> 09:38.643
And what can you tell us
about adam hutchings?

09:39.679 --> 09:40.745
Who?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.247
You really want
to play it like that?

09:42.249 --> 09:43.515
It's only going to hurt more
when you lose.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.083
Are you accusing me
of something?

09:45.085 --> 09:46.618
Should I be?

09:50.256 --> 09:54.025
The guy called me about
one of the buildings I closed,

09:54.027 --> 09:55.927
The crown building,
over on douglas.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.095
He was a reporter
doing a story.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.630
He wanted to see
the closing documents.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.432
-Did you give 'em to him?
-Of course not.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.767
Attorney work product,
that means it's confidential.

10:02.935 --> 10:06.137
What documents was
he looking for specifically?

10:06.139 --> 10:09.040
The contract of sale,
the title work,

10:09.042 --> 10:11.443
Zoning variances,
environmental studies,

10:11.445 --> 10:13.445
The buyer's corporate minutes
authorizing the purchase...

10:13.447 --> 10:14.613
Exciting things like that.

10:14.615 --> 10:15.981
The buyer being...

10:15.983 --> 10:17.115
Crown building corp.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.217
What's so special
about this building?

10:19.219 --> 10:20.885
Nothing really.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.121
Six-story residential rental.
Fully leased.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.090
Patrick: And he never told you
why he wanted the documents?

10:25.092 --> 10:27.459
No, actually, he just seemed
really crazy to me.

10:28.427 --> 10:29.628
Did he do something?

10:29.630 --> 10:32.330
Yeah. Son of a bitch
went off and died.

10:38.838 --> 10:41.206
You don't think I had
anything to do with this?

10:43.342 --> 10:45.744
Let's go, detective finnegan.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.545
Let the counselor
finish his lunch.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.050
Bon appetit.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.424
-Hand cream?
-Leo: Nah.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.593
Hand cream is what
your grandma uses

11:01.595 --> 11:03.128
For her dry elbows.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.764
What I was selling
was hand ecstasy.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.533
-You're selling ecstasy.
-Exactly!

11:09.435 --> 11:11.903
Morrison: Would you
please state your name?

11:14.707 --> 11:15.940
Your name, miss?

11:17.543 --> 11:19.344
This is a serious
offense, mr. Taylor.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.680
That makes sense,
'cause I'm a serious
motherfucker.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.448
(chuckles)

11:23.450 --> 11:26.284
In addition to the 10,000
we pulled off your assistant,

11:26.286 --> 11:27.852
There was another
15 in your apartment.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.020
(scoffs)

11:30.356 --> 11:32.691
I always figured
I'd end up dead
or in prison, anyway.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.359
I'm just surprised
it didn't happen sooner.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.561
Do you have anything you
want to say in your defense?

11:37.029 --> 11:38.730
I ain't no rat.

11:38.732 --> 11:42.767
The possession of
counterfeit currency
carries a penalty of 20 years.

11:48.207 --> 11:51.209
(clears throat)
I'm sorry, did you say "20"?

11:51.211 --> 11:53.111
-That's right.
-(sighs)

11:57.383 --> 12:00.051
So, chicago,
it be cold, y'all.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.753
Your hands,
they take a beatin'.

12:01.755 --> 12:07.225
But this be
the best hand cream
money can buy.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.160
Come on, stand up straight.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.462
And more eye contact.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.565
-Would you stop?
-Sorry, dear.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.333
(knocking on door)

12:15.335 --> 12:16.468
Fuck!

12:22.274 --> 12:23.441
What?

12:23.443 --> 12:24.776
We're looking for
talia freeman.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.211
What did I do?

12:26.213 --> 12:27.912
-Miss freeman, we have
a warrant for your arrest.
-What?

12:28.114 --> 12:29.280
Please put your hands
behind your back.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.415
Are you fucking
kidding me? No!

12:30.417 --> 12:31.883
You have the right
to remain silent...

12:31.885 --> 12:33.585
-Talia: For what?
-Officers, may I have
a look at that?

12:33.587 --> 12:35.620
This is bullshit.
What did I do?

12:35.622 --> 12:36.788
Bishop: Suspicion
of possessing

12:36.790 --> 12:38.456
-Counterfeit currency.
-(sighs)

12:39.759 --> 12:42.594
Talia, listen. I'm going to go
call your brother right now.

12:42.596 --> 12:45.029
Don't say anything
until he talks to you.
Understand?

12:45.031 --> 12:46.598
I didn't do anything!

12:46.600 --> 12:48.500
-Keep her warm.
-Talia: Jesus! Ow!

12:51.270 --> 12:53.638
This is such bullshit.

12:59.044 --> 13:01.279
Lowry: You know,
you seem like a sweet girl.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.214
I'd melt in your mouth.

13:04.650 --> 13:06.217
But the thing is,
you got yourself knee-deep

13:06.219 --> 13:07.552
In a federal shithole.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.788
I ain't done nothin'.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.056
And the shit's getting higher
every time you lie to us.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.260
Who the fuck is this bitch?

13:15.262 --> 13:17.796
Angela: This "bitch"
has the only ladder
out of that hole.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.131
See, turns out that money
in your purse...

13:20.133 --> 13:22.033
Well, secret service
says that it's funny.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.335
I don't know nothin' about it.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.703
Angela:
Shit's rising quick, talia.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.572
If I were you,
I'd lift up my chin.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.174
(scoffs)

13:29.441 --> 13:31.676
See, what the assistant
us attorney is saying

13:31.678 --> 13:34.445
Is that secret service
matched the serial number
on your bills

13:34.447 --> 13:37.482
To plates being used
by the 13th street kings.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.851
What she's saying is that
if you could shed some light

13:39.853 --> 13:41.119
On this strange coincidence,

13:41.121 --> 13:43.321
She might be willing
to lessen your legal burden.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.989
Like I said,

13:44.991 --> 13:48.026
I know nothin' about
how that money got there.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.495
-Po-po is probably framin' me.
-(scoffs)

13:50.497 --> 13:52.497
You know what? I might be
willing to believe you.

13:53.699 --> 13:58.002
Except that your friend,
leo taylor,

13:59.839 --> 14:03.041
Says that you gave him
30 grand of the same bills
two days ago

14:03.043 --> 14:05.410
To start up
a business venture.

14:05.711 --> 14:08.012
Now, that's long before
the po-po ever showed up
at your house.

14:08.014 --> 14:11.149
(scoffs) yeah, well,
leo's a limp dick.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.218
Lowry: You see, that's
exactly what I was thinking.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.719
Fuck him.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.888
You know what else?

14:16.890 --> 14:18.790
Fuck your boyfriend, too.

14:18.792 --> 14:21.826
The one from the kings
who gave you that money.

14:21.828 --> 14:24.495
Just give us a name, talia,
and you'll walk out that door

14:24.497 --> 14:26.130
-A free lady.
-(door opening)

14:26.132 --> 14:30.168
Talia, do not say
another word.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.036
-Martin stein.
-I know who you are.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.304
Then you know the consequences

14:33.306 --> 14:35.340
For talking to my client
outside of my presence.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.374
She waived counsel.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.575
Talia: I don't need no lawyer.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.711
-I didn't do nothin'.
-I said shut up, talia.

14:42.314 --> 14:43.615
Black.

14:44.183 --> 14:45.617
I beg your pardon?

14:47.052 --> 14:49.287
My coffee, I take it black.

14:49.588 --> 14:52.724
Croissant would be lovely
as well if you have one.

14:53.993 --> 14:55.760
Password for your wi-fi is?

14:59.064 --> 15:00.798
(thunder rumbling)

15:01.734 --> 15:03.601
That true, what
you were saying before?

15:03.603 --> 15:04.702
What?

15:04.704 --> 15:06.404
That you really wanted
to be a lawyer?

15:06.406 --> 15:08.973
Yeah, a long time ago.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.820
Hold on.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.489
I know you.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.125
You rookied with gonzales.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.426
Flannigan, right?

15:28.594 --> 15:30.929
-Finnegan.
-Joe bauer.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.298
-The kraut with nine toes.
-(chuckling)

15:33.300 --> 15:35.466
Gonzo was all over you.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.136
Hey, joe.

15:38.971 --> 15:41.272
Have you ever seen this guy
around the building?

15:41.274 --> 15:43.207
His name's adam hutchings.

15:43.209 --> 15:44.409
Can't say that I have.

15:44.411 --> 15:47.045
-What did he do?
-He got himself dead.

15:48.280 --> 15:51.049
That's good for business,
am I right?

15:51.051 --> 15:52.617
We're just gonna take
a look around the building.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.485
Sorry, I can't
let you do that.

15:55.487 --> 15:57.021
You're kidding, right?

15:58.123 --> 15:59.457
(sighs) look.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.125
My boss is
a major pain in the ass,

16:01.127 --> 16:02.527
Does a lot of spot checks.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.662
Unless a tenant
invites you in,

16:04.664 --> 16:06.431
This is as far as you go.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.632
I'm sorry.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.068
I need the weekly.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.470
You're really going to
make us get a warrant?

16:19.278 --> 16:20.545
All right.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.763
That's 10 bucks more
for the wrapping.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.366
Okay. You know what?
I'm gonna take a card as well.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.935
-That's another four.
-(keys clacking)

16:43.937 --> 16:46.204
Makes a grand total of $28.75.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.139
$28.75.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.008
-There you go.
-Thank you.

16:50.609 --> 16:52.410
You know what?
Keep it. Thank you.

17:02.054 --> 17:03.287
How you doing?

17:03.289 --> 17:05.522
Can I get general howard's
room number, please?

17:05.525 --> 17:08.526
Sorry, it's against policy.
But I can call him for you.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.461
-Okay, yeah. Great.
-Okay.

17:13.298 --> 17:14.898
(line ringing)

17:19.371 --> 17:21.372
I'm sorry,
he doesn't seem to be in.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.307
All right. Um...

17:23.309 --> 17:25.476
I can take that for you,
if you like.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.743
I assure you it'll be safe.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.813
I'll get it to the general
as soon as he returns.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.448
Okay. There you go.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.383
Thank you so much.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.785
Oh, you know what?

17:34.653 --> 17:36.054
Oh, I don't know
if I signed the card.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.889
-Let me just make sure,
if you don't mind.
-Mmm-hmm.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.097
Ethan: Perfect.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.232
Thank you very much.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.801
You're welcome.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.344
Hello?

18:01.747 --> 18:03.114
How you doing?

18:03.116 --> 18:04.549
I'm looking for a good friend
of mine, general howard.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.484
-Is he in?
-Sorry. Nobody here.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.423
Where did you get
the necklace?

18:12.425 --> 18:13.791
My boyfriend.

18:15.627 --> 18:16.794
Unless your boyfriend

18:16.796 --> 18:18.429
Is a dead eight-year-old
in san francisco,

18:18.431 --> 18:20.364
Then you're a liar
and a fucking thief.

18:20.366 --> 18:23.501
Now, I'm gonna give you
one more chance, marie.

18:23.702 --> 18:25.770
Where did you get
the fucking necklace at?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.038
I found it under the couch.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.639
Give it to me.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.343
Now get out of here.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.573
Oh, grace.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.246
(horn honks)

19:48.220 --> 19:49.587
(sighing)

19:50.956 --> 19:52.456
(dialing)

19:54.693 --> 19:55.860
(cell phone buzzes)

19:55.862 --> 19:58.229
-Hello?
-Ethan:  <i>They got her, marty.</i>

19:58.231 --> 19:59.830
The one fucking person

19:59.832 --> 20:01.699
That could have nailed them
to the wall, they got her.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.901
Ethan, what the hell
are you talking about?

20:03.903 --> 20:05.102
Grace travis.

20:06.071 --> 20:07.538
Well, help me
out here, will you?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.140
Who is grace travis?

20:09.142 --> 20:10.608
They killed a cop.
<i>She's a cop.</i>

20:11.977 --> 20:14.245
Howard and roberts
are out their fuc...

20:14.247 --> 20:15.313
They're out of control.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.215
I'm gonna get 'em, marty.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.317
And when I do, I'm gonna
tear their fucking heads off.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.819
No, you don't, ethan.
No, you don't.

20:21.821 --> 20:25.056
That is a bad idea.
That is a really bad idea
right now.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.524
-I don't give a shit.
-Yes, you do.

20:26.526 --> 20:27.892
Now, you're the smart one.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.160
We will get them.

20:29.162 --> 20:31.896
We will get even with them,
you and me.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.130
But we gotta be
smart about it.

20:33.665 --> 20:34.832
<i>All right?</i>

20:35.500 --> 20:36.934
My dad, you know...

20:36.936 --> 20:38.869
Shit. They're gonna go
after my dad. I gotta go.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.738
Get your dad,
and get out of town.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.307
I will send you
an address. Lay low.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.142
<i>-Okay? </i>
<i>-Yeah, yeah, yeah. All</i>
<i>right, all right.</i>

20:51.750 --> 20:54.118
-(line ringing)
-come on. Pick up, dad.

20:54.853 --> 20:56.554
(on answering machine)
hi, this is george kelly.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.055
I'm not home right now,
so leave a message.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.357
-(machine beeps)
-dad, it's ethan.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.658
Pick up the phone
if you're there.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.562
Pick up the phone!

21:04.564 --> 21:05.696
(rings doorbell)

21:05.698 --> 21:07.498
Dad, it's ethan.
Pick up the phone.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.134
Listen, you call me
the moment you get this.

21:10.369 --> 21:11.602
Call me.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.106
(answering machine beeps)

21:40.932 --> 21:42.133
(rings doorbell)

21:43.468 --> 21:45.202
(line ringing)

21:45.804 --> 21:48.839
Woman:  <i>Good afternoon,</i>
<i>sun valley grocers,</i>
<i>how may I help you?</i>

21:48.841 --> 21:50.341
George kelly, please.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.809
He's not in yet.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.344
Okay. What time is he due in?

21:53.346 --> 21:55.579
He'll be in at
6:00 p.M. Tonight.

21:55.581 --> 21:57.148
-Great. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

22:11.463 --> 22:12.797
Watch it, watch it,
watch it, watch it.

22:12.799 --> 22:13.998
Oh!

22:25.177 --> 22:26.477
Hey, where's
your brother at, man?

22:26.479 --> 22:28.112
Ain't he supposed
to pick you up?

22:28.114 --> 22:29.213
Reggie's busy, I guess.

22:29.215 --> 22:31.349
Yeah, reggie's busy, huh.

22:32.117 --> 22:33.751
Now, get in the car.
I'll give you a lift.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.088
Thanks, man.

22:45.731 --> 22:48.399
United states v.
Freeman, talia m.

22:48.401 --> 22:51.202
Charges are
two counts of uttering
counterfeit obligations

22:51.204 --> 22:54.672
Pursuant to usc chapter 25,
section 472.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.273
How does the defendant plead?

22:58.977 --> 23:00.444
Not guilty, your honor.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.815
I'm honored, mr. Stein.
It's not every day

23:04.817 --> 23:07.485
An attorney of your stature
walks into my courtroom.

23:07.487 --> 23:11.122
Only when the very notion
of justice itself
is under attack, judge.

23:12.090 --> 23:14.558
Angela: The defendant,
with intent to commit fraud,

23:14.560 --> 23:16.827
Passed a sum of
30,000 counterfeit dollars,

23:16.829 --> 23:18.729
In order to buy into
a start-up business.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.731
In addition,
when apprehended,
she was in possession

23:20.733 --> 23:23.734
Of another $10,000
in counterfeit bills.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.870
I can't wait
to hear this, mr. Stein.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.905
My client herself
was defrauded, judge.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.073
By whom?

23:29.075 --> 23:31.308
This isn't a trial,
miss guthrie.

23:32.010 --> 23:34.845
Okay. Talk to me about bail.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.580
-$100,000.
-No bail, judge.

23:36.582 --> 23:37.748
The defendant has ties

23:37.750 --> 23:39.850
To members of
a notorious gang, your honor.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.419
I once had lunch
with jay cutler,

23:41.421 --> 23:43.654
That doesn't make me
a member of the bears.

23:46.691 --> 23:48.692
Okay, let's split
the difference.

23:48.694 --> 23:50.094
Bail is set at $25,000.

23:51.730 --> 23:53.297
Due respect, your honor,
that's not exactly splitting
the difference.

23:53.299 --> 23:54.999
I wasn't very good at math.

23:56.968 --> 23:58.169
Let's go.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.221
(chuckling)

24:17.989 --> 24:20.391
You really fucked up
this time, talia.

24:21.326 --> 24:23.194
Nothin' you can't handle.

24:23.562 --> 24:26.297
(sighs) this isn't like
the girl who od'd
in your salon.

24:26.299 --> 24:27.731
This is federal court.

24:27.733 --> 24:30.668
I thought you was good
at this law shit.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.636
Marlon sure pays you enough.

24:32.638 --> 24:35.105
Sometimes there's no rabbit
down at the bottom of the hat,

24:35.107 --> 24:36.474
No matter how far
down you reach.

24:36.775 --> 24:38.242
They've got you on
physical evidence.

24:38.244 --> 24:40.077
They've got you
on parole evidence.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.612
If this was marlon,
you'd do some shit.

24:41.614 --> 24:43.314
You're not marlon.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.895
Some ways I'm better.

24:58.196 --> 25:00.164
Get your hand off of me.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.500
(scoffs)

25:07.305 --> 25:09.907
That accountant,
this is his fault, you know.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.710
He gave me the money

25:12.712 --> 25:14.678
After he made a pass at me.

25:15.113 --> 25:18.015
Made me promise
not to tell marlon.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.583
How was I supposed to know
the money was fake?

25:20.485 --> 25:22.620
He committed fraud on me.

25:25.724 --> 25:27.691
-That's a good story.
-It's what happened.

25:27.693 --> 25:30.194
No, I am saying that...
That can work.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.496
That's a good story,
if it wasn't for the fact

25:32.498 --> 25:35.799
That oren kamanski
prefers cock, that is.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.404
(chuckles) jesus!

25:40.406 --> 25:41.972
You're looking
at 20 federal...

25:41.974 --> 25:44.275
I ain't going to
no penitentiary.

25:47.145 --> 25:48.279
I know shit, you know.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.417
I know lots of shit.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.124
(brakes screech)

26:02.727 --> 26:04.995
What shit exactly
are you referring to?

26:04.997 --> 26:06.063
I'm just saying.

26:08.166 --> 26:12.002
I get locked up,
you and marlon,

26:13.538 --> 26:15.739
You're both coming with me.

26:18.343 --> 26:19.677
Get out.

26:19.679 --> 26:22.179
-We ain't near home.
-Get the fuck out.

26:25.016 --> 26:26.684
Get the fuck out.

26:29.220 --> 26:30.788
(seatbelt clicks)

26:36.761 --> 26:38.662
(breathing hard)

26:41.399 --> 26:42.633
Dad?

26:46.738 --> 26:48.439
Hey, dad!

26:50.942 --> 26:52.176
(sighs)

27:25.310 --> 27:26.910
(line ringing)

27:27.245 --> 27:29.246
(on voice mail)
hi, you've reached
george kelly.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.081
Leave a message,
and I'll call you back.

27:40.425 --> 27:41.992
Paper or plastic?

27:44.329 --> 27:45.529
Okay.

27:51.936 --> 27:53.871
Vin: Thanks for dinner.
Jack: No worries.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.273
So, reggie's po find him
a new job or something?

27:56.275 --> 27:59.009
Vin: Reggie says
jobs are for suckers.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.711
But he always got
plenty of green.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.913
Yeah, you know what?
I don't want to hear anything
about that, okay?

28:03.848 --> 28:05.749
So what time does your
brother usually roll in at?

28:05.950 --> 28:08.185
Reggie got himself a new girl.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.853
So, he's not coming home then?

28:09.855 --> 28:11.922
Yeah, but... Damn, she fine!
(laughs)

28:12.524 --> 28:13.824
All right, listen, man.

28:13.826 --> 28:16.226
You're gonna crash
on my couch tonight.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.162
First thing in
the morning though,

28:18.164 --> 28:20.164
You're calling reggie.
I wanna talk to him, okay?

28:20.166 --> 28:21.965
-(siren blaring)
-vin: All right.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.778
All right, man, it's cool.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.450
What are you doing, man?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.351
Just making sure.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.153
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is this?

28:44.022 --> 28:45.222
(sighing)

28:45.224 --> 28:46.724
You're kidding me, right?

28:46.726 --> 28:48.425
You're fucking...

28:49.194 --> 28:50.627
You kidding me?

28:55.366 --> 28:56.800
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

29:05.577 --> 29:07.277
License and registration, sir.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.680
Yeah. Look, I know I, uh...

29:09.682 --> 29:11.815
I know I screwed up
back there.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.921
No excuses though.
If you just wanna give us
a ticket, we'll be on our way.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.189
You're in a rush
to get somewhere?

29:19.191 --> 29:20.691
No, man.
I'm just heading home.

29:20.693 --> 29:22.826
-Have you been drinking?
-Of course not. No.

29:23.027 --> 29:24.128
Drugs?

29:24.863 --> 29:27.364
I've got a child
in the car, officer.

29:27.366 --> 29:29.266
How old are you, son?

29:29.434 --> 29:30.601
Fourteen.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.469
Do your parents know
where you are?

29:32.471 --> 29:34.071
Doubt it.

29:34.073 --> 29:35.873
Look, I'm a counselor
at the community center, okay?
That's...

29:35.875 --> 29:37.307
Step away from the car, sir.

29:37.976 --> 29:40.477
Look, vin's just coming to
spend the night at my place.

29:42.447 --> 29:43.747
I live with
my girlfriend, man.

29:43.749 --> 29:46.350
I'm happy for you.
Now step away from the car.

29:46.551 --> 29:48.051
Yeah, okay.

29:48.053 --> 29:49.853
I'm getting out, man.
Don't worry.

29:50.321 --> 29:51.622
It's cool, vin.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.096
Turn around. Hands
on the hood of the car.

29:59.098 --> 30:02.299
Look, my girlfriend
is a dea agent, okay?

30:02.301 --> 30:03.567
Her name is harper deakins.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.702
You guys can look into it.
You can check it out.

30:08.239 --> 30:10.240
I'm sure she'd be
proud of you.

30:11.009 --> 30:13.210
-Grab the kid.
-It's okay, vin.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.813
It's okay, man,
just go with him.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.047
(handcuffs locking)

30:19.317 --> 30:20.551
Thank you.

30:21.853 --> 30:23.153
My break?

30:23.155 --> 30:25.322
Yeah, try not to come back
smelling like a chimney.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.057
Yes, sir, thank you.

30:55.153 --> 30:56.353
(cell phone vibrating)

30:57.555 --> 30:58.856
(on voice mail)
hi, you've reached
george kelly.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.190
-Leave a message...
-Son of a bitch.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.585
-Where is george kelly?
-On break.

31:28.853 --> 31:31.088
-Yeah, but where is he?
-Check the back room.

31:33.391 --> 31:34.558
Shit!

31:45.904 --> 31:46.970
(grunts)

31:54.412 --> 31:55.512
(groaning)

31:55.514 --> 31:57.281
-Ethan: Come on, let's go.
-(coughing)

32:01.886 --> 32:02.986
Shit!

32:03.755 --> 32:04.955
What the hell is going on?

32:04.957 --> 32:06.123
I'll tell you later. Let's go.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.190
-Keep moving.
-Come on.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.166
Get in the car.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.042
(tires screeching)

32:28.246 --> 32:30.514
(panting)

32:40.391 --> 32:42.993
No one in or out
of the building.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.395
No one has to get milk?

32:46.097 --> 32:47.764
Walk a dog?

32:47.766 --> 32:50.834
-Maybe they all work late.
-That's bullshit.

32:51.502 --> 32:53.070
I'm calling guthrie.

32:53.072 --> 32:55.105
You're gonna get
a warrant from the da

32:55.107 --> 32:57.708
-Because the building
is quiet?
-(cell phone vibrating)

33:00.578 --> 33:02.012
Finnegan.

33:08.186 --> 33:10.854
I'm her partner.
Hold him there.

33:11.856 --> 33:13.123
-What?
-We gotta roll.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.491
-What's happening?
-It's not good.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.625
Patrick?

33:15.627 --> 33:17.361
Jack. He got
pulled over by the cops.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.062
They found coke on him.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.199
He's been clean
for five years.

33:22.467 --> 33:23.567
He had a kid with him.

33:25.970 --> 33:27.070
Fuck.

33:27.438 --> 33:28.572
Fuck!

33:39.851 --> 33:41.351
Harper: I appreciate this.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.853
Officer: Yeah, no problem.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.755
-Thank you.
-Okay.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.590
They're letting you go.

33:47.392 --> 33:48.458
(handcuffs unlocking)

33:50.862 --> 33:52.295
You know those drugs
weren't mine, right?

33:52.297 --> 33:53.930
You believe me, huh?

33:54.632 --> 33:56.199
Got an older brother
who is mia,

33:56.201 --> 33:58.702
But the kid's gonna
have to spend the night
in foster care.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.871
Shit! See, that's what...

34:00.873 --> 34:02.372
That's all I was
trying to avoid.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.440
Yeah.

34:04.008 --> 34:06.076
-I'm gonna wait in the car.
-Mmm.

34:07.011 --> 34:09.212
You took a risk, saying
those drugs were yours.

34:09.214 --> 34:11.081
So you don't
believe me, do you?

34:11.083 --> 34:12.382
(sighs)

34:12.717 --> 34:14.051
Do you think
the community center

34:14.053 --> 34:15.351
Is gonna entrust you with kids

34:15.353 --> 34:17.987
After finding out about
your previous drug issues?

34:18.723 --> 34:20.357
Okay. So, that's it.
You're embarrassed?

34:20.359 --> 34:22.225
No. You did not
embarrass me, okay?

34:22.226 --> 34:23.827
They want to drop this
as soon as possible.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.630
-The less said the better.
-Not for you, though.

34:27.665 --> 34:29.232
Look, I care about vin.

34:29.234 --> 34:31.201
And I care about
all those kids at the
community center, okay?

34:31.203 --> 34:32.768
-So I'm not gonna...
-And I don't?

34:32.771 --> 34:34.905
You think I don't care
about them as much as you?

34:34.907 --> 34:36.172
I'm not saying that. I just...

34:36.175 --> 34:37.974
How many times have I
got to bail you out, jack?

34:38.509 --> 34:40.409
Is that what just happened?

34:40.411 --> 34:41.844
You bailed me out?
You gave them money?

34:41.847 --> 34:43.612
-Are you out of
pocket on this?
-You know what I mean.

34:47.752 --> 34:50.253
Look, if I'm an
inconvenience for you...

34:50.255 --> 34:52.255
Don't be a martyr.
It doesn't suit you, okay?

34:52.257 --> 34:54.091
I can't do this right now.
I gotta go.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.126
All right.
Then just walk away.

35:14.445 --> 35:15.512
Thank you.

35:15.813 --> 35:17.647
Betsy: Figured
you needed a refill.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.816
Marty: Wow,
you're letting me off easy.

35:20.618 --> 35:22.252
You know
I want to talk about this

35:22.254 --> 35:24.287
And you know I know
what you're gonna say.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.123
So, better left unsaid,
that about it?

35:26.125 --> 35:28.391
What can I tell you?
You know me.

35:31.095 --> 35:35.031
Talia is a manipulative,
conniving, poisonous cunt.

35:35.600 --> 35:36.800
I know.

35:37.502 --> 35:38.935
Marlon's gonna talk to her.

35:38.937 --> 35:41.771
Marlon has been
talking to talia
for the past 10 years.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.240
Does talia change? No.

35:43.908 --> 35:45.142
(sighs)

35:45.144 --> 35:46.409
She can't be that stupid.

35:46.411 --> 35:48.044
Yes. She is that stupid.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.647
She is his sister,
for crying out loud.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.616
(chuckling)

35:52.618 --> 35:53.683
Jesus!

35:54.785 --> 35:57.387
I can't let this get
in the way of business.

35:57.655 --> 35:58.889
Betsy: (chuckling) oh, yeah?

35:59.524 --> 36:00.690
How is business?

36:00.692 --> 36:02.325
You're kidding, right?
Just happened to be...

36:02.327 --> 36:03.660
Okay, you're not kidding.

36:04.295 --> 36:05.395
(sighs)

36:06.330 --> 36:08.498
This is bigger than
just my business.

36:09.133 --> 36:11.334
I'm not gonna throw away
everything that
we've worked for.

36:11.502 --> 36:13.103
Betsy: Not worth much
behind bars though.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.105
Do you want to go to prison?

36:15.107 --> 36:16.940
It would save me from
this lovely conversation.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.577
Marty, get rid of her.

36:30.788 --> 36:32.389
(door opening)

36:34.192 --> 36:35.258
What the fuck!

36:35.459 --> 36:36.793
Fuckin' stealing from me?

36:36.795 --> 36:38.061
-Huh?
-Marlon, I can explain.

36:38.063 --> 36:41.097
What? Huh? You want that shit?
Eat that shit. Huh?

36:41.299 --> 36:43.133
Obviously, that's all
I am to you, right?

36:43.135 --> 36:45.368
I didn't steal no money
from you!

36:45.703 --> 36:47.537
Oren did not
make a pass at you, t!

36:47.539 --> 36:48.772
It was leo!

36:49.207 --> 36:50.273
Save it for court.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.309
I was doing
some lines at leo's

36:52.311 --> 36:54.044
And I shot my mouth off
about oren's vault.

36:54.345 --> 36:56.346
That's nobody's business
except mine.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.248
I am sorry, marlon.

36:58.549 --> 37:00.817
But it was leo
who gave me the money!

37:02.587 --> 37:04.588
Even fuckin' now,
you're still lyin'.

37:07.858 --> 37:09.326
You and me are done, t.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.066
I didn't take nothing!

37:51.135 --> 37:55.038
How did you get past
a dea background check

37:55.040 --> 37:57.173
With a drug-addict boyfriend?

37:57.375 --> 37:58.708
I didn't know.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.211
How could you not know?
You live with the guy!

38:01.412 --> 38:03.113
It was in the past.
It never came up.

38:03.614 --> 38:07.284
Oh, so you're out picking
wallpaper and bedsheets,

38:07.286 --> 38:09.686
But his drug problem,
that never came up.

38:10.087 --> 38:11.454
-Harper: No.
-(chuckling)

38:11.622 --> 38:12.956
(chuckling) no.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.292
-What?
-I just find it
a little bit strange

38:15.294 --> 38:16.993
That never came up
in conversation.

38:17.228 --> 38:18.295
Harper: It came up,

38:18.297 --> 38:20.130
When the dea
was crawling up my ass

38:20.132 --> 38:21.798
Looking for
any sign of indiscretion

38:21.800 --> 38:23.333
That would bounce me
from the program.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.836
They looked at anyone within
a five-mile radius of me.

38:26.838 --> 38:27.971
Ouch.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.006
Yeah, but I still got in.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.909
That's because of
your piercing intellect.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.913
But you love the guy,

38:37.481 --> 38:40.317
So I think you gotta
cut him some slack.

38:40.319 --> 38:42.652
I mean, we stick our necks out
all the time, nothing happens.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.888
At least he's sticking
his neck out to save a kid.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.724
A kid carrying cocaine.

38:48.192 --> 38:49.993
Who was supposed to
sleep on our couch.

38:50.928 --> 38:52.362
I would have done
the same thing.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.498
Harper: That's
a guy thing, right?

38:56.167 --> 38:59.369
You champion him,
it's supposed to
make me like you more.

38:59.371 --> 39:00.437
Workin'?

39:05.309 --> 39:07.677
The whole crown building thing
doesn't seem odd to you?

39:07.679 --> 39:11.214
I mean,
three hours, six floors,
no one has a dog to walk?

39:12.183 --> 39:14.851
Well, I didn't see no
"no pets" sign, but...

39:20.558 --> 39:21.725
Deak?

39:22.360 --> 39:23.993
-No.
-No, what?

39:23.995 --> 39:26.496
I know where you're going
with this. You wanna break in.

39:26.498 --> 39:27.964
I don't wanna break in.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.168
I want to buzz every buzzer
until someone buzzes us in.

39:35.806 --> 39:37.440
And then
when they don't, yeah.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.243
I wanna break in.

39:40.245 --> 39:43.113
Oh, that changes everything.

39:45.983 --> 39:47.150
(sighing)

39:58.696 --> 39:59.896
(knocks on door)

39:59.898 --> 40:01.398
-Yo.
-Marlon: Yo.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.599
(door shuts)

40:03.734 --> 40:05.068
'sup, man?

40:07.738 --> 40:08.938
(sighing)

40:10.841 --> 40:12.809
I got something for you
to take care of tonight.

40:13.577 --> 40:15.311
-All right.
-Tonight.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.647
All right, man, shit.

40:20.351 --> 40:22.685
Hey, are suppliers
still using these
to move biscuits?

40:24.889 --> 40:26.689
I haven't seen no flags, man.

40:44.809 --> 40:46.042
(clears throat)

40:47.278 --> 40:48.511
Man, you sure?

40:53.717 --> 40:54.884
All right.

40:55.486 --> 40:56.886
Let you know when it's done.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.060
(sighs)

41:07.398 --> 41:09.332
(alarm blaring)

41:19.310 --> 41:20.510
Told ya.

41:20.811 --> 41:23.213
There's 40 apartments,
not one buzzes us in?

41:23.647 --> 41:25.415
Patrick: Neighborhood
is not the safest.

41:25.417 --> 41:27.016
You answer the door,
you're not expecting anybody,

41:27.018 --> 41:28.485
You wind up
with a shotgun in your face.

41:28.487 --> 41:29.886
You're seriously doing this?

41:30.120 --> 41:31.721
This is... This is bad.

41:31.989 --> 41:34.224
-Shh.
-This is really fuckin' bad.

41:37.361 --> 41:38.561
(sighs)

41:40.798 --> 41:42.265
No, you gotta hit it
harder than that.

41:45.703 --> 41:47.337
Give it a good whack!

41:47.972 --> 41:49.205
Whack it!

41:52.109 --> 41:53.176
There you go.

41:54.011 --> 41:55.278
Harper: Okay, it's stuck.

41:55.479 --> 41:57.680
Well, you fuckin'...
You hit it too hard.

41:58.449 --> 42:00.083
-Seriously?
-Leave it.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.294
Harper: There's not a light on
in the place.

42:11.296 --> 42:13.763
They're probably trying
to save on the power bill.

42:20.971 --> 42:22.205
Deak?

42:22.207 --> 42:23.940
You're gonna get
our asses canned.

42:24.408 --> 42:27.310
"good bye!"
"what was that, patty?"
"oh, that was your pension."

42:27.878 --> 42:29.279
Harper: You're being a baby.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.884
Patrick: My ass should be
in bed right now

42:34.886 --> 42:37.086
And I should be dreaming
sweet-ass dreams.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.289
Harper:
These walls are due
for a coat of paint.

42:47.431 --> 42:48.565
You're drunk.

42:49.166 --> 42:50.300
That was locked.

43:01.579 --> 43:02.812
(sighing)

43:27.805 --> 43:30.306
Jesus christ,
you scared the shit out of me.

43:31.475 --> 43:33.610
Guess we know
why no one buzzed us in.

43:34.712 --> 43:37.580
Why would a security guard
tell us there are
tenants here?

43:37.582 --> 43:39.549
Maybe your buddy
wanted to keep us out.

43:41.452 --> 43:42.952
Might be a stash house.

43:51.895 --> 43:53.129
(harper clears throat)

43:59.436 --> 44:00.870
Holy shit, patty.

44:02.239 --> 44:03.973
You recognize this?

44:09.446 --> 44:12.215
This is from one
of hutchings' photos,
the ones I found in his car.

44:13.584 --> 44:15.018
Hutchings was here.

44:16.587 --> 44:19.255
Whatever he was on to
had something to do
with this building.

44:37.641 --> 44:39.676
(mellow song playing)

45:08.372 --> 45:09.772
(water running)

45:13.210 --> 45:14.444
(lock clicks)

45:36.834 --> 45:38.835
(toilet flushing)

46:11.735 --> 46:13.202
You motherfuckers!

46:21.779 --> 46:22.979
(dialing)

46:23.447 --> 46:24.647
(line ringing)

46:24.915 --> 46:26.682
Dispatcher:  <i>911.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

46:27.284 --> 46:30.520
You didn't want to tell me
on the telephone, so, go.

46:31.155 --> 46:32.989
Man: She knows
about the building.

46:36.393 --> 46:38.361
You stupid fuckin' imbecile.

46:40.464 --> 46:43.533
How the fuck
could you let this happen?
