00:00.209 --> 00:02.294
CNBC's Jane Wells live in Los Angeles

00:02.377 --> 00:05.756
with how the 360's problems
are heating up literally.

00:05.839 --> 00:09.593
This all came together
in this horrific perfect storm.

00:09.676 --> 00:14.223
Some faulty Xbox 360s are literally
melting down while running certain games.

00:14.306 --> 00:18.519
It was a slow rolling thing, like, really
understanding how big the problem was.

00:18.602 --> 00:22.147
It started to really be concerning
and the numbers started to grow.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.857
I had a sick feeling in my stomach.

00:23.941 --> 00:25.943
Microsoft hasn't specified the cause,

00:26.026 --> 00:28.028
but users say the console's cooling system

00:28.111 --> 00:29.905
just can't take the heat of a lot of play.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.199
We were just having failure after failure.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.367
The problem was huge.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.910
Mine just crashed this holiday season.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.162
Get one back,
turn it on, it didn't even work.

00:37.246 --> 00:39.748
No! Again!

00:39.831 --> 00:41.959
People spent a lot of money on a console

00:42.209 --> 00:44.461
and we're getting two
and three of them back.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.255
Whether they were friends,
whether they were family,

00:46.338 --> 00:47.339
whether they were people on the street.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.258
It didn't matter.
It was all over the place.

00:49.341 --> 00:51.343
I was mad as

00:51.426 --> 00:55.264
Then it became the media saying
this is a piece of hardware

00:55.347 --> 00:58.725
that has been rushed to market,
and as a result

00:58.851 --> 01:00.936
we're seeing unprecedented failure rates.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.437
It's broken.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.899
Everything that I had worked for
for the last couple of years is trashed.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.488
There's a new contender
in the video game wars.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.739
Xbox is going to be....

01:12.823 --> 01:15.117
- The future.
- Truly the future of video games.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.119
Xbox.
Taking over the living room.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.580
Limitless, connected
digital entertainment.

01:19.663 --> 01:21.039
You guys never understood!

01:21.123 --> 01:23.333
The company is going
to face fierce competition.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.960
Sniper. Nooo!

01:25.043 --> 01:26.587
It's a ticking time bomb.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.422
It makes me very nervous
to actually play this for you.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.424
Xbox, getting a major overhaul.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.759
A bold vision for the figure of gaming.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.053
It's the Xbooooooox!

01:48.817 --> 01:50.986
Without a doubt, the most Herculean feat

01:51.069 --> 01:54.281
of the original Xbox was that it survived.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.618
Looking at the history
of the video-game business,

01:57.701 --> 02:00.787
you would have given them
a million-to-one chance,

02:00.871 --> 02:04.166
so the achievement is that
we made it to Xbox 360.

02:05.250 --> 02:09.463
And, internally, it's fun to laugh
at lots of the missteps.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.090
You'll see Xbox will actually start up.

02:12.216 --> 02:13.300
Like we can laugh

02:13.383 --> 02:16.178
that the Xbox didn't turn on
at the original unveil.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.097
We can bring that video up?

02:19.181 --> 02:24.019
But with Xbox 360, honestly,
even with the benefit of time,

02:24.102 --> 02:26.063
nobody laughs at the red rings.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.566
To understand the red rings of death,

02:29.650 --> 02:31.443
you've gotta go back to the beginning

02:31.527 --> 02:35.948
and all of the work we did on the Xbox 360
to build it from the bottom up.

02:36.865 --> 02:40.869
We were absolutely focused
on getting out ahead of the PS3.

02:40.953 --> 02:44.289
We needed to be seen
as the start of the next generation.

02:48.252 --> 02:52.172
The 360 was five to ten times
more powerful than the original Xbox.

02:52.256 --> 02:55.634
And so, to achieve
that level of performance,

02:55.717 --> 02:58.720
we had to push technology and solutions

02:58.804 --> 03:02.182
that didn't exist
in the previous generation.

03:02.266 --> 03:05.602
This was an incredibly
hard, complicated program.

03:06.103 --> 03:09.606
The circuit board itself is,
is a completely custom design.

03:09.857 --> 03:13.819
And we were building these chips
which was a new process at the time.

03:13.902 --> 03:17.614
We did our own internal design
instead of buying off the shelf silicon.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.241
We're bringing up new hardware,

03:19.324 --> 03:20.993
with software that isn't quite done yet,

03:21.076 --> 03:24.162
on new test systems
that we're developing in real time.

03:24.246 --> 03:27.249
And that had a domino effect
on the whole product.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.126
The design was coming together
kind of late.

03:29.209 --> 03:34.840
We were launching in November of 2005
and we did not see our first silicon

03:35.132 --> 03:39.761
from the CPU until February of 2005.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.346
That's just ridiculous.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.640
That's nine months before launch.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.018
That is an absurdly short timeframe.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.604
The normal timeframe
would probably be like two years.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.981
And so we're faced
with finishing the design

03:51.064 --> 03:53.108
and ramping up production lines
at the same time.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.152
We wanted to launch it worldwide

03:55.235 --> 03:57.237
so everybody had it at the same time.

03:57.321 --> 04:00.532
But that's a big challenge
because you also need

04:00.616 --> 04:03.285
to have enough units to restock in retail,

04:03.410 --> 04:06.622
so that the countries you do launch in
aren't out of inventory.

04:06.705 --> 04:07.831
We need to get our yields up.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.416
And so, we're cranking up production.

04:10.209 --> 04:14.087
At the highest manufacturing output,
I remember hearing numbers like a console

04:14.171 --> 04:15.589
would come off the line
every four seconds.

04:17.883 --> 04:22.930
But, as we're ramping
production, we start to see reports

04:23.013 --> 04:24.556
of these issues that were coming up.

04:25.224 --> 04:26.975
Lots of inconsistencies.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.186
Consoles would fail at test stations.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.605
If you had built 100 of these things,

04:31.688 --> 04:36.109
only 50 or 60 of them would work,
which is really, really bad.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.947
Like a real robust yield rate
would have been 90, 95.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.492
This was the fog of war
that we had to see through,

04:43.617 --> 04:44.993
and that was, is there something wrong

04:45.077 --> 04:48.580
with the design of the product,
or are we testing it incorrectly?

04:48.664 --> 04:51.542
Because we were trying
to ship in high volume,

04:51.625 --> 04:55.712
there wasn't much time to think about it
because there was so much to be done.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.757
One way of dealing
with the failed consoles

04:58.841 --> 05:03.345
was to put them into these nice boxes
and stack them

05:03.428 --> 05:06.431
so that you would get back to them
at some future point in time.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.893
In a way we were kicking the can
down the road a little bit.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.937
We were developing
what we call a bone pile.

05:12.479 --> 05:16.775
At the height, we created a bone pile that
was over 600,000 units deep.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.695
And so it's, it's just like
the Lucille Ball episode

05:19.778 --> 05:21.697
where the chocolates
are coming off the conveyor belt.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.283
And they're coming off so fast
that they can't do anything with them.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.659
That's exactly what was going on.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.121
The thing about building consoles

05:29.204 --> 05:34.668
is Christmas doesn't change,
so your schedule is paramount

05:34.751 --> 05:38.672
and there's just so much pressure
to get it done by November.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.929
After a hectic leadup to production,

05:46.013 --> 05:48.307
and months of intense troubleshooting,

05:48.390 --> 05:53.103
engineers finally managed to solve the
technical issues that had plagued the 360.

05:53.187 --> 05:57.649
As consoles started to pass QC,
the team was finally able

05:57.733 --> 06:00.777
to chip away at the bone pile,
in an effort to meet the demand,

06:01.069 --> 06:04.573
which, at the time
of launch, was ravenous.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.202
Good evening, everyone!

06:08.869 --> 06:13.707
So who here is ready for Xbox 360?

06:17.753 --> 06:20.339
I'm outside the Best Buy in Midtown.

06:20.422 --> 06:23.258
It's raining here in New York
but these gamers don't care.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.219
They've been out here in the rain
since early this morning

06:25.302 --> 06:27.846
and they're not leaving
until they get an Xbox 360.

06:27.930 --> 06:29.556
Finally!

06:29.723 --> 06:35.479
When the Xbox 360 launched there was
a palpable excitement for this console.

06:35.562 --> 06:39.316
The Xbox 360 finally got out
of your dreams and into your car.

06:39.399 --> 06:43.862
Microsoft had their fingers firmly
on the pulse of what gamers were expecting

06:43.987 --> 06:47.115
and they clearly had a vision
of what gaming would be for the future.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.785
We got in with something
that was unique and revolutionary.

06:49.868 --> 06:53.413
A gorgeous design,
the concave elements of the 360.

06:53.497 --> 06:58.001
It really felt like in some ways
that Xbox had actually just arrived.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.127
This new world of online.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.338
This new world of social engagement.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.298
This new world of building communities.

07:03.382 --> 07:04.716
Ohayou gozaimasu!

07:05.592 --> 07:09.721
We at Microsoft
had absolutely nailed that experience.

07:09.805 --> 07:11.265
The demand was really, really high.

07:11.348 --> 07:14.309
We were selling every single unit
we could ship into the market.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.312
I know there are a lot of
fans out there that want a 360,

07:17.396 --> 07:19.982
there's a shortage out there, you know,
is that a marketing strategy

07:20.065 --> 07:21.275
or can you not produce enough?

07:21.358 --> 07:24.736
- What's the real story on that?
- We are making as many as we can

07:24.820 --> 07:27.614
twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week, we are flying them in.

07:27.698 --> 07:30.784
Ultimately, we got
through our challenges of production.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.078
And we just needed to be able to catch up.

07:34.788 --> 07:38.000
By hitting the market
a full year before PlayStation 3,

07:38.083 --> 07:41.295
Xbox 360 had a head start
on the competition.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.174
But Sony was still
the undisputed industry giant.

07:45.299 --> 07:48.218
And they had every intention
of keeping it that way.

07:52.431 --> 07:55.392
It was the year after we shipped,
when PS3 was coming out.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.060
We were paranoid.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.856
Sony had such credibility
that they had cultivated

08:00.939 --> 08:03.400
from the PlayStation 1
to the PlayStation 2,

08:03.483 --> 08:09.198
so they were riding on this tidal wave
of success and goodwill from gamers.

08:09.281 --> 08:12.701
Coming off the PlayStation 2,
Sony had done everything right.

08:12.784 --> 08:16.205
The most successful platform
in game-industry history,

08:16.288 --> 08:19.499
and really just needed
to stay to the playbook.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.669
In contrast to that, you just witnessed

08:22.753 --> 08:25.589
Microsoft coming to market
at the right price,

08:25.839 --> 08:28.091
a year before you're able
to come to market,

08:28.175 --> 08:30.802
so you know you're facing
formidable competition.

08:32.262 --> 08:37.059
PlayStation 3 is the best-of-breed
computer-entertainment platform.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.853
PlayStation 3 was positioned

08:39.937 --> 08:41.772
as a premium product from the get-go.

08:42.272 --> 08:46.026
This was going to play games,
but it would also play Blu-ray discs,

08:46.193 --> 08:48.320
so it was seen more as kind
of an entertainment machine.

08:48.403 --> 08:51.281
We knew they were going
to be somewhat arrogant.

08:51.365 --> 08:55.536
The next generation
doesn't start until we say it does.

08:55.869 --> 09:01.083
And they would price their console
to where they felt they needed to have it,

09:01.166 --> 09:03.252
because they felt
that they were untouchable.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.671
This is sort of pre-live streaming era,

09:05.796 --> 09:09.716
and a bunch of us were huddled
around one person's laptop,

09:09.800 --> 09:14.388
like a 15-inch laptop screen,
streaming Sony's press conference.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.014
And then they dropped the price.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.058
In North America, the PlayStation 3

09:18.141 --> 09:25.023
will be available at retail
for $599 US dollars, $659 Canadian.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.734
Wait a minute. Did... $599?

09:32.406 --> 09:33.657
$599.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.242
Nobody was prepared for that.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.745
Back then, consoles didn't launch
at those kind of price points.

09:38.829 --> 09:42.624
It was like, holy cow,
we just got handed this generation.

09:42.708 --> 09:45.752
We were high-fiving each other,
people were crying.

09:47.296 --> 09:51.425
There were just all these ways that Sony
had put their own foot in their mouth.

09:51.592 --> 09:54.636
Sony said it would be a
privilege for people to work extra hours

09:54.720 --> 09:56.972
to afford their overly-priced console.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.600
You have an over-engineered machine,

09:59.683 --> 10:02.394
that's gonna be incredibly
expensive to manufacture.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.938
And that opened a window for Microsoft

10:05.022 --> 10:08.275
to be able to soft of say,
"Hey, like we have a great system

10:08.358 --> 10:09.818
that's gonna play
all the games you wanna play.

10:09.902 --> 10:12.154
We've got better online, for cheaper."

10:12.738 --> 10:14.656
Thank you very much,
and have a great show.

10:16.033 --> 10:20.829
Becoming CEO right after the launch
of PlayStation 3 was like

10:20.913 --> 10:24.791
being made captain of the <i>Titanic</i>,
right after it hit the iceberg.

10:38.388 --> 10:44.102
After Sony's announcement, we could not
wait to get on stage the next day.

10:44.186 --> 10:45.687
Couldn't be more excited to be here

10:45.771 --> 10:48.649
because we're delivering
the next generation of gaming

10:48.941 --> 10:54.404
right here and right now, with titles
that are nothing short of spectacular.

10:54.488 --> 10:58.075
We had a lot of PlayStation fans,
and even Nintendo fans

10:58.158 --> 11:00.744
who were coming to Xbox,
because we had the best games,

11:00.827 --> 11:03.455
we had the best system,
we had the best online network.

11:03.539 --> 11:05.123
We led in every key aspect.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.042
With the help of our incredible partners,

11:07.125 --> 11:09.837
we're delivering
on that vision with Xbox 360.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.005
With a high-definition gaming experience

11:12.089 --> 11:15.133
more powerful
than anything else in the industry.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.302
Yeah. We were riding high,
we were celebrating,

11:17.386 --> 11:19.012
I'd say the morale was extremely high.

11:20.430 --> 11:23.475
We had so much pride in this product.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.185
Everything was great.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.354
And then, the storm hit.

11:29.273 --> 11:31.984
Before launch,
engineers had worked around-the-clock

11:32.067 --> 11:34.695
to fix 360's early technical issues.

11:35.070 --> 11:39.616
But, by June 2006, there were reports

11:39.700 --> 11:42.911
of an entirely new,
never-before-seen problem.

11:43.829 --> 11:45.873
Distress calls flooded into Redmond.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.667
Something had gone terribly wrong.

11:49.418 --> 11:52.671
It was in the forums and I started
to notice that something wasn't right.

11:53.922 --> 11:58.927
There was a lot of chatter
about console failures.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.097
Dude.
What?

12:02.181 --> 12:03.265
Your Xbox.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.434
You might want to take a look at it.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.729
Oh, [BLEEP]!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

12:08.979 --> 12:11.440
Over time, we kept
hearing more and more about it.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.860
We'd go to a launch event for a game
or we'd go to meet with games journalists,

12:14.943 --> 12:17.196
then they would all start
talking to us about it, like,

12:17.279 --> 12:20.908
"Before we can talk about new features,
we want to know, is this fixed?"

12:20.991 --> 12:23.118
But we had no sense
of how big of an issue it was.

12:23.535 --> 12:27.456
We didn't even know how to deal with it,
and then we saw more reports of it.

12:27.539 --> 12:31.752
Microsoft have been in the news
with their latest computer system,

12:31.919 --> 12:36.006
but it seems the last big product
they launched can have some problems.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.051
That's the first time I've seen
this There it is.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.094
Mother [BLEEP]!

12:41.178 --> 12:43.138
The Xbox 360 had a really cool feature

12:43.222 --> 12:47.100
where there were four green lights
around the Xbox emblem.

12:47.226 --> 12:50.312
Each of those lights
corresponded to a specific controller

12:50.604 --> 12:53.065
and so that's how you knew
what player you were in the game.

12:53.148 --> 12:57.152
We also used the ring to tell people
when there were issues.

12:57.236 --> 12:58.862
It's like
the check engine light on your car.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.948
And this is
what we called a core digital error.

13:01.031 --> 13:05.077
And this was an indicator of,
the system detected a major issue.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.247
The error state was just
that there was no communication,

13:08.330 --> 13:10.999
so the machine was just basically
telling you I can't do anything.

13:11.083 --> 13:14.628
This would show up as
three segments in the ring being lit red

13:14.711 --> 13:17.005
which would come to be known
as "the red ring of death."

13:19.967 --> 13:21.301
It's the red ring of death.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.471
Red ring of death.

13:26.265 --> 13:27.808
I got red ringed.

13:27.891 --> 13:30.102
Uh, everybody got red ringed.

13:30.811 --> 13:34.481
What the [BLEEP]?
Are you kidding me?

13:34.565 --> 13:36.191
When that mother red thing come up

13:36.275 --> 13:38.318
and then the whole game freeze
and mother

13:38.402 --> 13:39.486
be like,
"Man, what the is going on?

13:39.570 --> 13:41.697
We can't play. What's going on?
Your doing that too?"

13:41.780 --> 13:44.116
It was, it, oh my God. It was terrible.

13:44.533 --> 13:48.829
No! Red ring of death! Again!

13:48.912 --> 13:51.790
We have no Xbox. I'm calling support.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.625
You wait on hold for a while.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.003
They let you know
they really appreciate your call.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.505
You wait on hold a little bit longer
and then they go,

13:58.589 --> 14:00.591
"Okay, we're going to get you a
replacement unit."

14:01.133 --> 14:03.260
It doesn't show up for a week.

14:03.677 --> 14:07.681
All the enthusiasm's gone, and then here's
the new console and it was just like...

14:07.931 --> 14:08.974
Wow.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.768
This is the fourth Xbox.

14:11.852 --> 14:12.936
Microsoft.

14:13.395 --> 14:17.024
Effectively,
the failure rate was near 100%.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.776
It just became an epidemic.

14:19.860 --> 14:23.447
<i>♪ It was the Red Ring of Death! ♪</i>

14:23.530 --> 14:25.449
<i>♪ Console's hotter
than a dragon's breath! ♪</i>

14:25.532 --> 14:28.744
<i>♪ It was the Red Ring of Death! ♪</i>

14:28.827 --> 14:30.996
No fricking way!

14:31.079 --> 14:34.082
<i>♪ And I'm so pissed off!
Grab the phone! Dial tone! ♪</i>

14:34.166 --> 14:38.170

14:38.253 --> 14:39.838
<i>♪ I'm on hold! ♪</i>

14:41.131 --> 14:44.635
<i>♪ It was the Red Ring of Death! ♪</i>

14:44.718 --> 14:48.680
The glitches that went down with Xbox 360.

14:48.764 --> 14:50.807
I was mad as

14:50.891 --> 14:54.269
I'm like, get this fixed
or I'm leaving.

14:54.686 --> 14:55.812
I'm joining the enemy.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.105
It was simple as that.

14:57.189 --> 15:02.402
<i>♪ It's a faulty piece of manufacturing
from Redmond Washington Microsoft ♪</i>

15:03.612 --> 15:04.696
I feel kind of sorry for it.

15:07.282 --> 15:10.035
Not really. It deserved it.

15:10.744 --> 15:14.665
It's a big deal because,
it's just sort of the passion

15:14.748 --> 15:19.044
that gamers have for their hobby,
like, you don't want to be away

15:19.127 --> 15:22.881
from your console
any longer than you need to be.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.300
We felt the customer's pain.

15:25.384 --> 15:28.720
I had three boxes replaced,
you know, personally at my house.

15:28.804 --> 15:32.516
And it does make you think,
"Okay, I work here, and this experience

15:32.599 --> 15:35.477
is not a pleasant experience,
in sending your Xbox back."

15:35.727 --> 15:37.813
Microsoft's going to ship
you a cardboard coffin,

15:37.896 --> 15:40.023
and that's what gamers
were calling them online.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.608
"Did your cardboard coffin arrive?"

15:41.692 --> 15:43.944
I finally got my coffin.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.530
But hopefully I'll get him back.

15:47.030 --> 15:50.409
And you'd put your 360 in it
and ship it on back to Microsoft.

15:50.576 --> 15:54.079
I remember going out
to the curb and like meeting the UPS guy

15:54.496 --> 15:56.540
and looking in the back of the UPS truck

15:56.623 --> 16:01.753
and seeing wall-to-wall,
you know, Xbox returns.

16:03.672 --> 16:07.467
The fact that it was
happening to more and more people,

16:07.551 --> 16:10.804
and Microsoft was shipping
a lot of hardware.

16:10.888 --> 16:15.142
That just combined to this feeling,
that, hey, like,

16:15.225 --> 16:17.186
are you guys really taking this seriously?

16:17.269 --> 16:19.771
They're continuing to sell
defective hardware,

16:19.855 --> 16:23.150
so a consumer could walk
into the store today,

16:23.233 --> 16:27.696
buy a 360, take it home,
and it's a ticking time bomb.

16:30.991 --> 16:34.077
Is there any speculation out there
what the problem is?

16:34.328 --> 16:36.788
Um, there is a lot of speculation but,
because well, among other things,

16:36.872 --> 16:40.542
there are 500 million transistors
and 1700 parts in each of these boxes.

16:40.626 --> 16:42.544
- Mm-hmm.
- So the speculation could go anywhere.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.549
Whenever we had new game launches

16:47.633 --> 16:49.801
or new system updates, I would be out,

16:49.885 --> 16:53.722
meeting with the top games journalists,
showing them all the new stuff,

16:53.889 --> 16:55.432
and I'm trying to sell them on the future

16:55.516 --> 16:58.185
and they're like, "Dude my console's
not working. Like it's broken."

16:58.268 --> 16:59.436
For those who have experienced

16:59.520 --> 17:01.813
the flashing red lights,
what causes this exactly?

17:01.897 --> 17:05.567
That's kind of part of the problem
Kevin, Microsoft has been very vague

17:05.651 --> 17:07.986
about the specific causes,
they won't cite any specifics,

17:08.070 --> 17:09.279
they won't say exactly why.

17:09.363 --> 17:12.282
We didn't have
all the answers at that time.

17:12.366 --> 17:14.576
We were trying to figure this out.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.078
Do we have a heat problem?

17:16.411 --> 17:18.580
Is the solder in,
key components in the motherboard,

17:18.664 --> 17:21.291
is it cracking up and drying out
and we're losing that connection?

17:21.375 --> 17:22.543
We just couldn't figure it out.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.379
It's a long process.

17:25.462 --> 17:31.093
You had to test it at the board level,
you had to test it at the system level,

17:31.176 --> 17:35.472
and then you had to test it
in a rack level, and, we had, you know,

17:35.556 --> 17:37.891
almost a million of them
sitting in our bone pile.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.768
We'd fix the ones in the bone pile.

17:39.852 --> 17:41.562
We'd send it back out to the customer.

17:41.645 --> 17:44.523
And it turns out that wasn't the problem,
and it would break again.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.817
And I'm saying,
"Man, this is not going to end."

17:46.900 --> 17:50.612
After the third
or the fourth issue that we ran into,

17:50.696 --> 17:55.951
I remember thinking,
"Hey, maybe we're in over our heads."

17:56.034 --> 17:59.705
When we got to a point where we said
we're not figuring this out fast enough,

17:59.788 --> 18:02.165
we made the call to shut down production.

18:04.418 --> 18:06.628
We went line down at the factory.

18:07.546 --> 18:09.214
We wanted to figure out how to solve it

18:09.298 --> 18:11.592
before we built any more units
to go to customers.

18:11.675 --> 18:15.179
It stretched every bit of our imaginations
to try to figure out

18:15.345 --> 18:17.556
exactly what was going on
and how to fix the problem.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.224
This went on for months.

18:19.308 --> 18:21.268
These were the darkest days of my career.

18:22.436 --> 18:26.273
Are people going to now go
out and buy PlayStation or a Nintendo?

18:26.356 --> 18:28.025
Are they going to leave us as a brand?

18:28.108 --> 18:30.485
Every day you weren't gaming
was a bad day for you.

18:30.569 --> 18:34.865
You trusted us and you'd invested
this money in us and we let you down.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.116
Not gonna work.

18:36.783 --> 18:40.579
This was an incredibly,
incredibly trying time.

18:41.121 --> 18:44.833
You know, people use phrases like you
figure out what people are made of.

18:45.751 --> 18:49.296
Having gone through it, I can
actually say, that happens.

18:50.005 --> 18:52.090
It's a thing. It isn't just a phrase.

18:52.549 --> 18:58.263
Todd had to manage the very complex
process of what we call root causing.

18:58.347 --> 18:59.890
Until we knew what was going on.

18:59.973 --> 19:06.188
2006, 2007, I dedicated a lot of my life
to this Xbox in order to fix this problem.

19:11.193 --> 19:14.613
The breakthrough came
when we understood that the connections

19:14.696 --> 19:18.450
that were being broken
were not located on the motherboard

19:18.534 --> 19:20.619
but they were actually located
inside the components.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.705
The problem was,
a connection was breaking.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.041
The reason it was breaking was thermal,

19:26.124 --> 19:27.835
but it wasn't because
of the peak temperature.

19:27.918 --> 19:31.213
It was because when the unit would get hot
and then cold, hot and then cold,

19:31.296 --> 19:33.298
every time it did that,
it would stress the connection.

19:33.382 --> 19:35.843
All these people loved playing video games

19:35.926 --> 19:38.720
and so they would turn
this thing on and off,

19:38.804 --> 19:42.432
and when it would turn on and off,
you get all sorts of stresses.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.977
And just like when you,
you bend something too many times

19:45.060 --> 19:46.687
until it finally breaks,
that's what was happening.

19:47.479 --> 19:50.816
Once we figured it out,
how in the heck are we gonna fix this?

19:51.859 --> 19:54.945
Peter Moore and the executive team
faced a big decision

19:55.028 --> 19:58.407
about trying to fix this with all these
boxes that were out there in the wild.

19:58.490 --> 20:02.369
This was something
that could tarnish the brand,

20:02.452 --> 20:06.957
they needed to do not just something,
they needed to do the right thing.

20:08.500 --> 20:12.254
If we're going to save this brand,
we need first-class

20:12.337 --> 20:14.006
consumer-service reaction to this.

20:14.089 --> 20:18.510
The credibility of the whole platform
really I think hung in the balance.

20:18.594 --> 20:23.390
There was only one way to do this
and that is you have to fix every console

20:23.765 --> 20:29.062
for every customer at no cost,
no questions asked.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.982
I think we're off to a good start.

20:32.691 --> 20:34.776
And I remember sitting at a
whiteboard writing out some,

20:34.860 --> 20:38.530
just some simple math on repair rates,
times a dollar, times a customer,

20:38.614 --> 20:41.992
times an amount equals a number,
and that number became pretty big.

20:42.701 --> 20:44.411
And I remember feeling in my stomach,

20:44.745 --> 20:47.122
this is gonna be
a bigger issue than I thought.

20:47.206 --> 20:49.958
By the time we looked
at the cost of repairs,

20:50.250 --> 20:56.256
the lost sales that we factored in,
we had a 1.15 billion dollar problem.

20:57.341 --> 21:03.764
Peter had to go to Steve Ballmer
and basically say, "Hey, bad news.

21:03.889 --> 21:06.600
I need a billion dollars
to go fix this issue."

21:06.683 --> 21:09.978
I'm expecting to be ripped to shreds.

21:10.062 --> 21:12.189
Come on!

21:12.731 --> 21:15.692
It is a make or break situation for Xbox.

21:15.776 --> 21:19.488
If Steve Ballmer does not give Peter Moore
the money to go fix it, Xbox is dead.

21:19.571 --> 21:21.198
Like, there's probably
no question about it.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.992
To the credit of Steve, and I can still
see him looking at me right now.

21:24.076 --> 21:25.494
He said, "Do it.

21:26.370 --> 21:27.412
Just do it.

21:27.496 --> 21:29.706
We'll figure it all out.
We'll take the hit."

21:29.790 --> 21:32.251
Microsoft will spend at least a billion dollars

21:32.334 --> 21:37.506
to repair serious hardware failures
with its Xbox 360 video-game console.

21:38.006 --> 21:40.676
Over 200 million of this
was simply one-way

21:40.759 --> 21:42.761
overnight shipping around the world.

21:43.887 --> 21:45.806
Kudos to Microsoft for stepping up

21:45.889 --> 21:49.434
and putting their money
where the red ring of death was.

21:49.518 --> 21:52.563
It was one of the times when I've been
proudest to be part of Microsoft

21:52.646 --> 21:56.525
because, we made a mistake, we owned it,
and we did the right thing for consumers.

21:56.608 --> 22:00.487
Without that money spent,
without them taking the problem head on,

22:01.113 --> 22:03.740
there's probably no Xbox right now.

22:03.824 --> 22:07.953
We bet on our fans
and our brand and took the hit.

22:09.621 --> 22:12.374
Take that hit once, do it right.

22:14.042 --> 22:15.419
Don't ever regret it.

22:28.223 --> 22:31.518
When the 360 died on me,
I was pissed that it died,

22:31.602 --> 22:33.187
but I wasn't pissed at Microsoft.

22:33.270 --> 22:35.397
I just really wanted to get the 360 again

22:35.480 --> 22:37.649
and start playing again
because it was just awesome.

22:37.733 --> 22:40.027
It was frustrating but they had hooked us.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.654
So when you hook somebody, you know,
you know they're not gonna leave.

22:42.738 --> 22:44.698
They're gonna work with you
through difficult times.

22:45.449 --> 22:48.911
That was a good sign that people loved
the thing that you're building.

22:49.870 --> 22:52.164
But, even a billion dollar mea culpa

22:52.247 --> 22:55.542
may not have been enough,
had it not been for two x factors.

22:56.543 --> 22:59.129
A library of celebrated game titles.

22:59.505 --> 23:01.548
And support from game developers

23:01.632 --> 23:05.219
who loved how easy it was
to program for the Xbox 360,

23:05.302 --> 23:10.974
and saw in it the potential to take gaming
to places previously unexplored.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.993
<i>Gears of War</i>, at the time,
was the best-looking game ever made.

23:30.077 --> 23:35.123
And it became this poster child
for HD graphics and HD fidelity.

23:37.668 --> 23:40.379
Like, this is a game that people
are gonna immediately gravitate to

23:40.462 --> 23:44.091
and go "Oh my God, I can't believe the 360
looks that good," especially when they

23:44.174 --> 23:48.303
compare it to PS3, because this game looks
better than anything on PS3 right now.

23:48.387 --> 23:50.681
It was the fastest selling Xbox 360 game.

23:50.806 --> 23:52.975
It sold like a million units
in the first couple of weeks,

23:53.058 --> 23:56.562
and that really propelled
the 360 in a big way..

23:58.564 --> 24:04.361
<i>Gears of War</i> may just be the great hope
to turn the 360 into a must-buy console.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.989
It was a very different type of game

24:07.072 --> 24:10.117
for Microsoft, an M-rated game
with over-the-top violence.

24:10.993 --> 24:15.122
Everyone loved the signature weapon,
the chain gun, the Lancer.

24:15.414 --> 24:18.876
<i>Gears of War</i> was about appealing
to a hardcore gamer.

24:18.959 --> 24:22.546
The people that play <i>Gears</i>,
they have so much passion in it.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.799
People get tattoos
and it's just a deep connection

24:25.883 --> 24:27.509
they have with the franchise and the game,

24:27.593 --> 24:29.636
it's unlike any other
franchise that we have.

24:32.097 --> 24:34.892
That was satisfying.

24:35.392 --> 24:36.643
And all of a sudden you see

24:36.727 --> 24:41.690
this tide turn of every publisher
is then developing for the Xbox 360.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.781
We had secured
a lot of big games for Xbox 360, you know

24:49.865 --> 24:51.867
we published titles like <i>Mass Effect</i>.

24:52.367 --> 24:54.912
We had <i>Splinter Cell</i>
from Ubisoft of course.

24:55.329 --> 24:59.249
We really had this incredible portfolio
of games, we were the shooter box.

24:59.750 --> 25:02.628
<i>Call of Duty</i> was a
franchise we had bet on early,

25:02.711 --> 25:04.963
it was a PC franchise,
and we really established

25:05.047 --> 25:06.590
<i>Call of Duty</i> on the console in a big way.

25:06.673 --> 25:09.885
PETER MOORE:<i>Kameo</i> had this gorgeous, colorful game.

25:09.968 --> 25:13.055
It was all about frame rate,
it was about smooth visuals.

25:15.307 --> 25:19.436
<i>Forza</i> was built as a direct
competitor to <i>Gran Turismo</i>.

25:19.520 --> 25:25.150
We're gonna go off and we're gonna build
a great epic big racing simulator game.

25:25.776 --> 25:29.112
You had cars that had amazing
reflections of the sky.

25:29.446 --> 25:31.281
They had reflections of other things.

25:31.532 --> 25:32.991
You had particle effects.

25:33.534 --> 25:38.413
You had a lot of things that just made it
look much more real than any other game.

25:39.122 --> 25:42.960
To this day my son can
recognize cars by the engine sounds

25:44.002 --> 25:45.546
because he played so much <i>Forza</i>.

25:46.421 --> 25:48.048
If you look at Xbox 360,

25:48.131 --> 25:50.634
that was a moment
where we got it exactly right.

25:51.260 --> 25:53.846
It was just an incredible run
that I don't know

25:53.929 --> 25:56.723
that has ever been topped
in the history of gaming.

25:56.807 --> 26:00.060
And then, you know,
at the center of it all was <i>Halo 3</i>.

26:01.562 --> 26:03.897
It had been 3 years since <i>Halo 2</i>

26:03.981 --> 26:07.359
smashed industry records,
and <i>Halo</i> fans were clamoring

26:07.442 --> 26:09.820
for the next chapter
of the epic space saga.

26:10.571 --> 26:15.450
I think that we were really surprised by
the success, the huge success of <i>Halo 2</i>,

26:15.742 --> 26:19.663
and so as we were leading up to the <i>Halo 3</i>
campaign, I think we did kind of

26:19.746 --> 26:23.375
look at it all up from a marketing team,
as more of a Hollywood moment.

26:23.959 --> 26:27.129
With <i>Halo 3</i>, we want to get
out in front and make people aware that

26:27.212 --> 26:30.257
video games are not something
that are just for the boys.

26:30.340 --> 26:31.884
Video games have come of age.

26:33.719 --> 26:37.181
An exciting day
for video-game fans, and for Microsoft.

26:37.264 --> 26:42.102
Master Chief is back in the
most anticipated video game ever, <i>Halo 3.</i>

26:42.186 --> 26:44.104
Thousands lined up
to get the final installment

26:44.188 --> 26:46.273
of the trilogy
when it went on sale at midnight.

26:46.899 --> 26:51.862
I got here 6pm yesterday,
been waiting here ever since.

26:52.988 --> 26:54.072
<i>Halo 3.</i>

26:54.156 --> 26:57.075
What a massive launch event
that was for us.

26:58.202 --> 27:01.330
They have one million pre-orders
which is pretty much unprecedented.

27:01.413 --> 27:05.584
<i>Halo</i> is projected to sell
four million copies its first 60 days.

27:05.667 --> 27:09.838
More than twice as many
as the nine runners-up combined.

27:09.922 --> 27:11.757
It's only the biggest game ever.

27:12.299 --> 27:16.512
We were no longer some like
tech company trying to be in video games.

27:16.595 --> 27:20.682
We were launching one of the biggest
entertainment properties of all time.

27:20.766 --> 27:21.975
Yeah!

27:22.100 --> 27:26.104
<i>Halo 3</i> embodies our vision
for the future of entertainment.

27:26.188 --> 27:27.773
The franchise spawning everything

27:27.856 --> 27:32.736
from clothing, to action figures
and rumors of a <i>Halo</i> movie.

27:33.153 --> 27:38.492
<i>Halo 3</i> really started to make gaming
a mainstream cultural phenomenon.

27:38.951 --> 27:40.619
Its first-day sales could outdo

27:40.702 --> 27:45.207
not only the final Harry Potter book,
but the debut of <i>Spiderman 3</i>.

27:46.166 --> 27:48.502
When everything was tallied
we had generated over

27:48.585 --> 27:52.923
170 million dollars in revenue
in the first 24 hours,

27:53.006 --> 27:55.926
setting a new record for the biggest day
in entertainment history.

27:57.135 --> 27:58.595
It was just an amazing moment.

27:58.720 --> 28:02.641
It was one thing after another,
we had games, we had Time Magazine,

28:02.724 --> 28:06.478
everything started clicking
and it felt like, something's happening.

28:06.562 --> 28:09.273
We delivered the right content,
the right hardware,

28:09.356 --> 28:14.444
the right games, the right price,
and we were showing massive momentum.

28:15.696 --> 28:18.782
The ship had sailed,
and sailed magnificently,

28:18.991 --> 28:21.034
and kept sailing full-steam ahead.

28:21.994 --> 28:24.162
Only a week ago Peter Moore took the stage

28:24.246 --> 28:27.666
in Santa Monica, California
for Microsoft's E3 press event.

28:27.749 --> 28:30.919
A mere 7 days later
the man in charge of the 360

28:31.003 --> 28:34.882
and the Games for Windows division
has decided to move onto EA Sports.

28:36.300 --> 28:41.346
I left Xbox, because, I felt like
I had done what I needed to do.

28:42.848 --> 28:45.309
Ironically, he'll be
replaced by Don Mattrick,

28:45.434 --> 28:48.061
the former president of EA,
but one has to wonder,

28:48.145 --> 28:50.981
with the face of the Xbox gone,
how will this affect

28:51.148 --> 28:53.233
the 360's standing in the console wars?

28:54.318 --> 28:57.613
Don Mattrick was a really
accomplished game developer,

28:57.696 --> 29:00.824
as a kid he wrote these amazing games
and he was just like super smart.

29:00.908 --> 29:03.118
Don's really an innovator,

29:03.202 --> 29:05.621
he's a business leader,
he's really into the tech.

29:05.704 --> 29:08.874
He really wanted the Xbox to be a product

29:08.957 --> 29:10.959
that could reach a broader
and broader market.

29:11.043 --> 29:15.214
When I joined Microsoft,
Steve Ballmer said, "Xbox needs

29:15.297 --> 29:17.966
to have more than a two-product lifecycle.

29:18.050 --> 29:22.387
And to do that, we need to place bets,
we need to move into new categories,

29:22.471 --> 29:26.141
we need to innovate,
and create new hit products,

29:26.642 --> 29:28.685
both in gaming and in entertainment."

29:30.020 --> 29:33.690
When Don Mattrick came onboard,
it was more about trying to appeal

29:33.774 --> 29:36.318
to a completely different audience
and a very broad audience.

29:36.401 --> 29:39.404
So, there was this one meeting
where he shows up,

29:39.488 --> 29:41.740
and he says, "We're not going
for 30 million consoles,

29:41.823 --> 29:43.700
we're going for 300 million consoles."

29:43.784 --> 29:47.913
And, the strategy behind that was,
we need to make casual experiences.

29:49.373 --> 29:51.500
When the Xbox 360 launched,

29:51.583 --> 29:53.752
we had Xbox Live built in,
we had this

29:53.836 --> 29:57.798
very basic blade for marketplace,
and we had only game content.

29:57.881 --> 30:00.259
One of the things
that I had been tasked to do

30:00.342 --> 30:01.927
was go get us some entertainment content,

30:02.427 --> 30:05.514
which was an entirely
new idea at the time.

30:05.597 --> 30:07.307
We started doing deals with studios.

30:07.391 --> 30:08.934
We were excited when we had one movie

30:09.017 --> 30:10.686
and then two movies
and five movies and ten movies.

30:10.769 --> 30:15.607
Microsoft's Xbox will transform
into a next-generation entertainment hub.

30:15.691 --> 30:19.194
Users will be able to navigate
through music, movies, television shows.

30:19.278 --> 30:22.531
For the first time we're
realizing that streaming

30:22.614 --> 30:25.409
and digital-video content
was gonna be a big deal.

30:26.618 --> 30:28.495
And then we had Netflix come on.

30:28.579 --> 30:33.625
Xbox 360 was a big part
of putting Netflix in the living room.

30:34.293 --> 30:39.339
At the time, Netflix was
a mail-order DVD catalog service.

30:39.631 --> 30:44.261
Nationally, Netflix moves
more than 1.5 million DVDs a day.

30:44.386 --> 30:46.054
There's 40 of these warehouses

30:46.138 --> 30:47.222
- around the country.
- Right.

30:47.306 --> 30:50.809
So that nearly every customer
gets next-day delivery.

30:51.518 --> 30:54.605
Netflix hadn't done anything
with digital streaming,

30:54.688 --> 30:58.650
we thought, "Why don't we call them up,
see if they would be interested

30:58.734 --> 31:02.070
in distributing their content
through Xbox 360?"

31:02.654 --> 31:07.117
We definitely accelerated
their growth because we introduced them

31:07.242 --> 31:11.622
to tens of millions of devices
that were connected to a TV, overnight.

31:12.456 --> 31:15.083
It's a great opportunity for Xbox members
to never leave the sofa,

31:15.167 --> 31:18.712
you know, watch movies from Netflix,
play great games, it's a great platform.

31:19.546 --> 31:21.256
And then it's like,
what should we do next?

31:21.340 --> 31:24.927
Well we brought HBO, we brought Twitter,
we brought Facebook.

31:25.135 --> 31:26.929
Today that may not seem
that revolutionary,

31:27.012 --> 31:28.680
but at the time, the idea to be able to do

31:28.764 --> 31:31.225
that all in one box
had just never been done before.

31:34.186 --> 31:38.148
Our Xbox Live community,
the digital streaming services,

31:38.232 --> 31:41.735
the gamertags, the achievements,
the experiences, they were things that

31:41.818 --> 31:47.449
we would hear consumers say they loved,
and competitors say they were envious of.

31:48.242 --> 31:51.662
Xbox Live really proved
that people wanted digital content.

31:51.787 --> 31:55.791
I think that created this sort
of ripple effect that affected Nintendo.

31:55.874 --> 31:59.378
They knew that they probably needed
to shift on how they did some things.

31:59.461 --> 32:01.088
They weren't just going
to give you another console,

32:01.171 --> 32:02.840
they were gonna give you a console
that did something different.

32:02.923 --> 32:04.758
This is Mike.

32:05.175 --> 32:07.469
By day, he's Mike the businessman.

32:07.761 --> 32:10.264
But, when he picks up the new Wii remote

32:10.347 --> 32:14.977
from Nintendo, he's Mike
the warrior-superstar-athlete man.

32:17.104 --> 32:20.566
Holiday of 2006,
Nintendo released the Wii,

32:21.149 --> 32:23.193
and turned the world upside down.

32:24.945 --> 32:26.196
We're confident because

32:26.280 --> 32:28.574
for pick-up-and-play games
there's nothing like it,

32:28.657 --> 32:31.577
for baseball, for tennis,
games like that, it's fantastic.

32:32.077 --> 32:34.037
But with the nunchuck,
what you're able to do

32:34.121 --> 32:39.251
in a first-person type of game,
is a huge step forward in control.

32:39.334 --> 32:42.754
Nintendo came out of left field
with a device that wasn't

32:42.838 --> 32:45.924
based on technology,
it was based on a simple

32:46.008 --> 32:48.886
entertainment experience
of being able to play a game

32:48.969 --> 32:51.138
without being
a button masher on a controller.

32:51.221 --> 32:55.184
It really resonated with a mass audience,
a wider audience, all of a sudden,

32:55.851 --> 32:58.103
parents are playing video games
with their kids again.

32:59.354 --> 33:01.982
Suddenly you heard people
talking about video gaming

33:02.065 --> 33:03.317
as something that was good for you.

33:03.400 --> 33:08.155
<i>Wii Fit</i>
is about bringing fun into fitness.

33:08.447 --> 33:10.324
Video gaming as

33:10.407 --> 33:13.118
an approachable thing
that everybody could do.

33:13.202 --> 33:16.705
They went after senior citizens,
they went after female gamers,

33:16.788 --> 33:19.082
they went after people
who are not traditionally gamers.

33:22.294 --> 33:24.630
Clearly they expanded the audience

33:24.838 --> 33:27.299
and they took gaming
to mainstream entertainment.

33:31.720 --> 33:35.641
I remember Bill putting a lot of pressure
on the Xbox leadership team,

33:35.724 --> 33:39.144
how did we miss motion gaming,
what can we do to catch up?

33:39.228 --> 33:42.523
We need to compete,
we need to advance our game strategy,

33:43.190 --> 33:46.068
we don't want to do a Wii-mote rip-off.

33:46.193 --> 33:47.277
We want to do our own thing.

33:47.361 --> 33:51.114
Don also had this vision
for controller-free gaming.

33:51.198 --> 33:54.952
What would it be like
if instead of waving something,

33:55.035 --> 33:56.954
we were recording movement?

33:57.037 --> 34:01.416
We were recording state-of-people,
physically, through a camera.

34:01.959 --> 34:04.753
The controller
he thought was this impediment

34:04.837 --> 34:06.171
to more people playing games.

34:06.255 --> 34:09.216
Because you had to kind of learn this
device, and his view was, like, hey,

34:09.299 --> 34:12.636
if people could just like swat at things
or move things, or drive a car like this,

34:13.095 --> 34:15.347
it's kind of crazy, but it's like
if you could drive a car like this,

34:15.430 --> 34:18.392
that would make more people
more willing to play video games.

34:19.059 --> 34:22.980
We set out to really make
the console approachable

34:23.647 --> 34:25.899
to a whole new generation of people.

34:26.108 --> 34:27.609
To a whole new set of people

34:27.693 --> 34:31.530
that wouldn't otherwise think about gaming
as something that it was for them.

34:34.783 --> 34:37.494
We had already
been doing some technology exploration

34:37.578 --> 34:39.454
where we could map people.

34:39.538 --> 34:42.082
Using depth sensing and RGB cameras

34:42.165 --> 34:44.668
and microphones and stuff,
and you could have that

34:44.751 --> 34:47.588
by your television,
rather than holding something,

34:47.671 --> 34:50.048
you can still get these
similar types of experiences.

34:50.132 --> 34:53.969
The idea that we were gonna
use IR kinda display,

34:54.052 --> 34:56.263
projection and reflection,

34:56.680 --> 34:59.391
to measure movement, was pretty magical.

34:59.474 --> 35:02.144
Every step of the Kinect process was

35:02.227 --> 35:03.353
an inventing step.

35:03.687 --> 35:08.025
A lot of this work, we had to
figure out how to hack our way into it.

35:08.108 --> 35:11.278
We prototyped probably 30 activities.

35:11.403 --> 35:15.199
We found that the whole-body activities
were actually the most fun.

35:15.282 --> 35:17.743
And so that's
what we ended up focusing on.

35:17.826 --> 35:19.661
To create something
totally new for gamers.

35:27.085 --> 35:30.339
We launched Kinect
and it was a game-changer.

35:31.882 --> 35:33.717
I don't think anybody saw it coming.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.303
It was something completely
new and unexpected.

35:36.386 --> 35:37.763
- Wow, that's...
- So you can see if we wave our hands..

35:37.846 --> 35:39.264
- Oh my gosh.
- it's tracking your full body.

35:39.348 --> 35:40.432
- That's crazy.
- Now we're playing.

35:40.516 --> 35:41.892
- Okay.
- So if you lean left and right...

35:42.392 --> 35:44.478
- Oh!
- Jump, jump, jump!

35:44.561 --> 35:47.648
In your opinion John, how does this
compare to the Wii and the <i>Wii Fit</i>?

35:47.731 --> 35:51.944
Oh it completely blows it away,
and this extends far past just gaming.

35:52.361 --> 35:55.948
It's crazy, it's <i>Minority Report</i> status,
that's how I see it.

35:56.657 --> 36:00.285
When I saw the Kinect, I thought,
"Oh finally, like this is something

36:00.369 --> 36:01.620
we're gonna use for VR eventually,

36:01.703 --> 36:03.997
it's going to be amazing
to have you in the game."

36:04.081 --> 36:07.125
Because it's motion gaming
people think oh it's like the competitors,

36:07.209 --> 36:10.671
it is a completely different thing,
you have to play it to understand that.

36:10.796 --> 36:12.548
The games were really fun.

36:12.631 --> 36:15.717
It really unlocked
a new game experience for people.

36:15.801 --> 36:17.803
Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! Fireball!

36:19.429 --> 36:21.974
We started getting people
all cheering and yelling

36:22.057 --> 36:26.144
and you know encouraging the person
who's actually playing to try new things.

36:26.395 --> 36:29.356
The idea that, like,
you would have people over for dinner

36:29.439 --> 36:32.609
and then afterwards everybody
would want to turn on the Xbox

36:32.693 --> 36:35.404
and go play ping pong
or go play <i>Kinect Sports</i>

36:35.487 --> 36:38.740
or go play a <i>Dance Central</i>,
that just gave Xbox 360

36:38.824 --> 36:40.659
a whole 'nother sense of purpose.

36:41.451 --> 36:48.292
In the first 60 days, we sold over
eight million Kinect sensors worldwide.

36:50.085 --> 36:55.757
Kinect was a technological marvel,
but it totally fell flat with core gamers.

36:55.841 --> 36:57.634
Kinect didn't work with <i>Halo</i>.

36:58.343 --> 37:03.348
But Kinect was an amazing tool
for so many things like research

37:03.432 --> 37:07.769
and how we think about augmented reality
and virtual-reality experiences.

37:08.437 --> 37:11.523
It's been fun to watch
innovation of computer science

37:11.607 --> 37:14.026
come not from academia or industry
but to come from gaming.

37:15.527 --> 37:17.946
And it turned out that
Kinect creative community

37:18.030 --> 37:21.325
just went on to do incredible things
with this device.

37:21.617 --> 37:24.077
People got into hacking
the Kinect early last year.

37:24.161 --> 37:28.624
Smartly, Microsoft responded by welcoming
that, and encouraging more development.

37:28.707 --> 37:31.835
People were taking
all the IR data and the voice data,

37:32.085 --> 37:36.548
and it was a rich source of creativity
for other types of applications.

37:36.632 --> 37:39.718
What is neat is the technology
that is used in video games now

37:39.801 --> 37:42.554
and how it can be applied
to other things, not just gaming.

37:42.638 --> 37:44.932
And they're calling it the Kinect Effect.

37:45.015 --> 37:47.976
Microsoft's Kinect
could revolutionize medicine.

37:48.060 --> 37:51.480
Being used to aid the
rehabilitation of stroke patients.

37:51.730 --> 37:54.566
Also by people who work
with autistic children.

37:54.942 --> 37:58.946
Kinect today
is mostly used outside of gaming.

37:59.029 --> 38:02.741
So, gaming has created
this piece of technology

38:02.824 --> 38:05.202
that today drives the industry forward.

38:07.871 --> 38:09.748
With Xbox 360,

38:09.831 --> 38:12.960
we had an amazing product
that had finally broken through.

38:13.085 --> 38:14.837
The ecosystem was healthy.

38:14.920 --> 38:19.091
Consumers were engaged
in North America and Europe.

38:19.174 --> 38:21.260
It was the top-selling hardware device.

38:21.844 --> 38:26.265
Xbox 360 has been
the number one-selling console

38:26.348 --> 38:30.310
every month for the last six months.

38:30.394 --> 38:33.981
It was a pretty great second iteration
for Microsoft as a company.

38:34.523 --> 38:35.732
Against all odds,

38:35.816 --> 38:38.735
the Xbox 360 basically won
that second console generation.

38:40.279 --> 38:42.906
By the end of that
generation I think people had sort of felt

38:42.990 --> 38:48.245
the pendulum had swung from PlayStation
dominance to Xbox dominance.

38:48.787 --> 38:51.456
There were more players
than ever playing Xbox.

38:51.540 --> 38:53.542
The brand really was in a terrific place.

38:53.625 --> 38:57.004
And there was no chance,
there was nothing Microsoft could do

38:57.087 --> 39:00.174
that could possibly torpedo the success
that they had with the Xbox 360.

39:01.508 --> 39:04.052
We're about to change
entertainment forever.

39:04.136 --> 39:05.220
Again.

39:05.304 --> 39:07.306
Because we're gonna
take all that we learned...

39:07.389 --> 39:09.391
In more than thirty years of innovation...

39:09.474 --> 39:10.809
And use it to change...

39:10.893 --> 39:11.935
Television. Television.

39:12.019 --> 39:13.270
- TV.
- TV. TV.

39:13.353 --> 39:14.396
- TV.
- TV.

39:14.479 --> 39:16.148
- TV. TV.
- TV. TV.

39:16.231 --> 39:18.400
- TV.
- Television. Television. Television.

39:18.483 --> 39:22.029
- Watch TV.
- Team Xbox is on a new mission.

39:22.112 --> 39:23.488
This is it.

39:23.697 --> 39:24.823
Xbox One.

39:27.576 --> 39:29.119
I can't believe...

39:30.078 --> 39:32.664
I cannot believe this press conference!

39:33.373 --> 39:35.250
We've got
this vast amount of gamers

39:35.334 --> 39:37.294
that are increasingly loving Xbox,

39:37.377 --> 39:39.963
and we're building great experiences
that they've never seen before,

39:40.047 --> 39:43.008
and now we're going
to be the connected TV,

39:43.091 --> 39:45.928
so we're gonna have the set-top box
for the living room,

39:46.303 --> 39:48.680
and it turned out like nobody wanted that.

39:48.764 --> 39:51.141
Oh hell no, Microsoft.

39:51.683 --> 39:52.684
Hell no.
