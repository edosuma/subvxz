(male narrator)
Previously, on a very
special Clone High...

00:05.833 --> 00:08.167
Cleo was left alone,

00:08.167 --> 00:12.133
and Gandhi's misbehavior
made him the class clone.

00:12.133 --> 00:13.567
See what I did there?

00:13.567 --> 00:15.600
That wasn't just a rhyme;
it was a play on words.

00:15.600 --> 00:16.767
Get used to it.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.300
I do that sort of thing
all the time.

00:19.300 --> 00:21.933
My friends call me pun dog.

00:21.933 --> 00:24.833
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

00:24.833 --> 00:27.767
* Secret government employees

00:27.767 --> 00:30.667
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

00:30.667 --> 00:33.700
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

00:33.700 --> 00:36.500
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

00:36.500 --> 00:39.333
* They're gonna make it
if they try *

00:39.333 --> 00:42.233
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

00:42.233 --> 00:48.567
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

00:48.567 --> 00:51.300

00:58.633 --> 00:59.833
[all speaking at once]

00:59.833 --> 01:02.800
[loud screeching]

01:02.800 --> 01:07.367
This is Principal Scudworth
with an important announcement.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.533
The PXJT is upon us!

01:09.533 --> 01:11.633
[pencil clatters]

01:11.633 --> 01:16.067
Fail the PXJT and your life
will be ruined forever!

01:17.633 --> 01:20.500
But win or lose, remember,

01:20.500 --> 01:23.067
the most important thing
in life

01:23.067 --> 01:26.633
is to use
a number two pencil.

01:26.633 --> 01:29.533
[growling] Number two.

01:29.533 --> 01:31.167
Good luck and good day.

01:31.167 --> 01:33.067
[loud screeching]

01:33.067 --> 01:34.900
[grunts]

01:34.900 --> 01:38.300
[crying]

01:38.300 --> 01:39.333
[gasps]

01:39.333 --> 01:41.833
Here, let me help you.

01:41.833 --> 01:44.400
Abe, it's the PXJTs.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.467
Everyone expects me to ace them
and get into Clone State,

01:47.467 --> 01:49.800
but ever since I broke up
with JFK for real again,

01:49.800 --> 01:51.100
there's no one
to provide me

01:51.100 --> 01:53.167
with emotional
and physical support.

01:53.167 --> 01:55.367
[tender acoustic music]

01:55.367 --> 01:58.367
Is there any way
I can help you emotionally...

01:58.367 --> 02:00.600
or physically?

02:00.600 --> 02:04.700
I guess I could use
a study buddy for the PXJTs.

02:04.700 --> 02:07.600
Great! I'll go pick up
some flash cards at lunch.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.833
You're so great, Abe.

02:09.833 --> 02:11.767
And would you get me a latte
on your way back?

02:11.767 --> 02:13.733
That would rock.

02:13.733 --> 02:16.067
Nonfat, 'kay?

02:16.067 --> 02:18.167
[rock music]

02:18.167 --> 02:21.067
This is a very tough time
for me.

02:21.067 --> 02:23.900
Without Cleo,
I'm a broken man.

02:23.900 --> 02:27.833
Hey, let's all go swimming
in my pool.

02:27.833 --> 02:30.067
And by "pool,"
I mean "bathtub."

02:30.067 --> 02:33.567
And by "swimming,"
I mean "sex!"

02:33.567 --> 02:36.867
That PXJT crap is useless
in the real world.

02:36.867 --> 02:39.633
Everything I need to know
I learned on the streets.

02:39.633 --> 02:41.767
- So you suck at taking tests?
- Yeah.

02:41.767 --> 02:43.067
You could take a prep course.

02:43.067 --> 02:45.400
School after school?
No way.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.100
I mean, one school's enough
for the G man,

02:47.100 --> 02:49.567
but two schools
is like, "What?"

02:49.567 --> 02:50.667
Oh, here comes Abe.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.167
Quick, pretend I said
something funny.

02:52.167 --> 02:54.500
Oh.
Hey, you just farted?

02:54.500 --> 02:57.067
That's hilarious!
You farted!

02:57.067 --> 02:58.300
[thud]
Ow!

02:58.300 --> 03:00.400
I haven't slept
in two days.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.067
Abe, the PXJTs are coming up.
You need sleep.

03:03.067 --> 03:04.367
Come on, Joan.

03:04.367 --> 03:06.067
I've got a list
of a million things to do.

03:06.067 --> 03:09.733
Sleep ought to be the number one
thing on that list, pal.

03:09.733 --> 03:11.433
[slurps]

03:11.433 --> 03:14.267
I was in my 18-wheeler
late one night...

03:14.267 --> 03:15.667
[slurps]

03:15.667 --> 03:17.300
Right about the sleepy hour...

03:17.300 --> 03:18.300
[slurps]

03:18.300 --> 03:20.533
When I come upon a cop car

03:20.533 --> 03:23.633
swerving around
in the suicide lane.

03:23.633 --> 03:26.300
And I could tell he was
too sleepy to be driving

03:26.300 --> 03:27.700
right then and there.

03:27.700 --> 03:28.700
[slurps]

03:28.700 --> 03:30.733
So I get up next to him

03:30.733 --> 03:33.500
and try to guide him
off the road with my rig.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.900
[truck bangs]

03:34.900 --> 03:38.267
But I cut it a little too hard
and sent that cop sailing

03:38.267 --> 03:39.700
right off a cliff.

03:39.700 --> 03:42.633
[laughing]

03:44.833 --> 03:46.667
Did you kill him?

03:46.667 --> 03:48.867
Kill him?

03:48.867 --> 03:51.300
I saved his life.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.667
Course, he's a cripple now.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.700
[slurps]

03:54.700 --> 03:57.067
Dang.

03:57.067 --> 03:58.867
Is that your rig?
Sweet!

03:58.867 --> 04:00.967
Man, trucking
must be the life.

04:00.967 --> 04:03.333
Whizzing in a bottle,
solving mysteries,

04:03.333 --> 04:05.700
not having to take
the PXJTs all the time.

04:05.700 --> 04:08.233
[spitting]

04:08.233 --> 04:11.300
Did you say PXJTs?

04:11.300 --> 04:12.500
[slurps]

04:12.500 --> 04:15.067
Bubala, you haven't
touched your kugel.

04:15.067 --> 04:16.433
Don't crowd the boy!

04:16.433 --> 04:18.833
Can't you see he's worried
about the PXJTs?

04:18.833 --> 04:22.567
Mom, Dad, I'm at
a turning point in life,

04:22.567 --> 04:25.400
and today I've made
a life-changing decision

04:25.400 --> 04:28.700
based on very poor information.

04:28.700 --> 04:31.400
I'm going to be a trucker.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.900
I'm going to hang myself.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.967
I have no son!

04:35.967 --> 04:38.600
(Mom)
I'm getting out
the good noose!

04:38.600 --> 04:40.333
(Shadowy Figure)
First off,
we want to thank you

04:40.333 --> 04:41.533
for your help
with our conspiracy.

04:41.533 --> 04:43.100
(Principal Scudworth)
Sure!

04:43.100 --> 04:47.767
Kids will be buying number two
pencils by the bucket load!

04:47.767 --> 04:50.733
[laughing maniacally]

04:50.733 --> 04:52.133
Why are we doing this again?

04:52.133 --> 04:55.067
(Scangrade)
Infidel!

04:55.067 --> 04:59.633
It is I,
Scangrade the Magnificent,

04:59.633 --> 05:03.367
a test grading/
world domination device.

05:03.367 --> 05:05.233
The PXJTs were created
to provide me

05:05.233 --> 05:06.367
with my energy source--

05:06.367 --> 05:09.067
lead from the number two pencil.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.933
After over 50 years of testing,

05:10.933 --> 05:13.400
his power will finally
be great enough to...

05:13.400 --> 05:16.367
Take over the world!

05:16.367 --> 05:20.267
[electronic voice] Oh, yeah.
That's a great [bleep] idea.

05:20.267 --> 05:22.933
Mr. B!
Language!

05:22.933 --> 05:26.467
Mr. B,
I hardly recognized you.

05:26.467 --> 05:29.233
I see you've put
on some weight.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.100
It's so cool, Joan.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.833
Cleo and I
are getting really close.

05:35.833 --> 05:37.733
Abe, your cart.
It's rolling!

05:37.733 --> 05:40.600
Abe, It's gonna hit
that Animal Cracker display!

05:40.600 --> 05:42.800
Abe, it's moving
really slowly!

05:42.800 --> 05:46.500
Just step forward
and grab the handle, Abe!

05:46.500 --> 05:49.500
[dramatic music]

05:49.500 --> 05:51.233

05:51.233 --> 05:52.233
[cart taps]

05:52.233 --> 05:53.667
[boxes thud]

05:53.667 --> 05:57.067
Abe, you're too tired
to be grocery shopping.

05:57.067 --> 05:58.467
Your reflexes are shot.

05:58.467 --> 06:00.733
My reflexes are fine.

06:00.733 --> 06:03.667
In three seconds, I'm going
to slap you across the face.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.167
Oof!

06:07.167 --> 06:09.433
You have a problem!

06:09.433 --> 06:12.200
You see,
I have a secret, Abe,

06:12.200 --> 06:16.733
and it's time I told you
that secret.

06:16.733 --> 06:17.767
Oh, I can't!

06:17.767 --> 06:20.300
It's such a big secret!

06:20.300 --> 06:21.667
Perhaps I'll tell you later.

06:21.667 --> 06:23.500
All I can say right now
is you need to sleep.

06:23.500 --> 06:26.400
I don't take orders
from you or anyone.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.567
[cell phone rings]

06:27.567 --> 06:30.400
Hi, Cleo.
Sure, I'll take your order.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.733
Spicy tuna roll,
California roll.

06:32.733 --> 06:34.367
Okay.
Got it.

06:34.367 --> 06:37.067
Yeah, yeah, oh, I always ask
for more ginger.

06:37.067 --> 06:38.200
Now I'm getting in the car.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.667
You can't drive!

06:39.667 --> 06:43.267
What if there had been
real animals inside this box?

06:43.267 --> 06:47.067
Yeah, Joan, I'm gonna crash
into a big box of animals.

06:47.067 --> 06:49.567
All right,
that's the last one.

06:49.567 --> 06:52.133
Literally all the pandas
in existence

06:52.133 --> 06:55.300
are on this truck,
so be extra careful

06:55.300 --> 06:57.300
and watch out for drivers
that are sleepy...

06:57.300 --> 06:59.067
[echoing]
Sleepy...

06:59.067 --> 07:01.633
(man on radio)
[suavely] Oh, yeah, baby.

07:01.633 --> 07:05.200
You're listening to KSLP,
the quiet storm--

07:05.200 --> 07:08.267
monotonous jams
that get inside your head

07:08.267 --> 07:10.233
and make you less alert.

07:13.733 --> 07:14.967
[screaming]

07:14.967 --> 07:16.700
[all screaming]

07:16.700 --> 07:18.367
[tires screeching]

07:18.367 --> 07:19.600
[truck horn blaring]

07:19.600 --> 07:22.400
[rock music]

07:22.400 --> 07:25.967
Cleo, I almost hit
a truckload of pandas.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.967
Oh, my God!

07:27.967 --> 07:30.600
You didn't take my cat
to the speech therapist?

07:30.600 --> 07:31.600
No, Cleo.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.467
This was a wake-up call,

07:33.467 --> 07:36.467
a wake-up call
about needing to sleep.

07:36.467 --> 07:39.433
I'm so sorry you need to sleep,
'cause tonight I was hoping

07:39.433 --> 07:41.867
we could spend
the night together.

07:41.867 --> 07:44.933
You know, pull an all-nighter
studying for the PXJTs tomorrow?

07:44.933 --> 07:46.267
But if you can't stay up,

07:46.267 --> 07:48.100
I'm sure there's
someone else who can.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.567
I can stay up
all night long!

07:51.567 --> 07:55.267
I accentuated the "up"
and also the "long"

07:55.267 --> 07:58.400
for what I hope
are obvious reasons.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.633
So let's get back together
and bone up on the PXJTs!

08:02.633 --> 08:03.867
Ha-ha!

08:03.867 --> 08:06.100
[whispering] Guess what
the P stands for.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.200
Penis!

08:07.200 --> 08:08.467
[guffaws]

08:08.467 --> 08:10.133
Wait, wait, when I said
that I needed sleep,

08:10.133 --> 08:12.067
I meant that I didn't
need sleep.

08:12.067 --> 08:13.133
Great!

08:13.133 --> 08:16.467
Then we'll do it
at my place.

08:16.467 --> 08:21.100
Oh, Mr. Butlertron, I've become
a pencil pusher, literally!

08:21.100 --> 08:23.300
[giggling]

08:23.300 --> 08:26.067
Remind me to send that one
to Leno.

08:26.067 --> 08:28.367
Yeah, [bleep] hilarious.

08:28.367 --> 08:30.667
Mr. B, what's your damage?

08:30.667 --> 08:32.467
Ever since Scangrade got here,

08:32.467 --> 08:34.867
you've been acting
like such a little bitch-bot.

08:34.867 --> 08:38.700
That Scangrade is just
such a mother[bleep] showboat.

08:38.700 --> 08:41.833
He's been this way
since Amherst.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.533
Infidels!

08:43.533 --> 08:49.133
It is I,
Scangrade the Magnificent!

08:49.133 --> 08:50.467
[cackles]

08:50.467 --> 08:52.667
Oh, hello, B.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.867
That's a nice apron
you're wearing.

08:54.867 --> 08:58.133
I believe Mrs. Scangrade
has the same one at home.

08:58.133 --> 09:02.600
[cackling]

09:02.600 --> 09:04.533
Man, this is
so much more fun

09:04.533 --> 09:07.567
than studying
for those wack PXJTs.

09:07.567 --> 09:09.767
Hey, let's pick up
some lady hitchhikers, huh?

09:09.767 --> 09:12.867
Gandhi, being a trucker's
not just about sleeping

09:12.867 --> 09:14.567
with random women.

09:14.567 --> 09:18.267
I mean, that's
a huge part of it.

09:18.267 --> 09:20.633
It's also about making choices,

09:20.633 --> 09:23.233
multiple choices.

09:23.233 --> 09:25.700
You mean, like, which
random women to sleep with?

09:25.700 --> 09:27.167
Bingo.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.533
Let's say our truck
leaves Chicago at 9:00 a.m.

09:29.533 --> 09:32.167
traveling east
at 50 miles per hour.

09:32.167 --> 09:35.100
Lonely housewife in Boston,
900 miles away,

09:35.100 --> 09:37.900
travels west
at 65 miles per hour.

09:37.900 --> 09:40.867
That's a guaranteed Bravo Juliet
for the both of us.

09:40.867 --> 09:44.467
But where and when, Gandhi?
Where and when?

09:44.467 --> 09:45.567
[murmuring]
Let's see.

09:45.567 --> 09:49.367
Conneaut, Ohio.
5:33 p.m.

09:49.367 --> 09:50.633
Step on it!

09:50.633 --> 09:53.367
Cleo, we need to talk.

09:53.367 --> 09:54.667
Abe's not sleeping.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.433
You got to cut down
on his hours, capisce?

09:56.433 --> 09:59.100
Somebody's jealous.

09:59.100 --> 10:02.700
Normally, yes, but there's
something you don't know, Cleo,

10:02.700 --> 10:04.067
something that happened,

10:04.067 --> 10:06.200
something personal.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.467
It happened to me...

10:08.467 --> 10:09.667
personally.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.133
But there's no time
to explain that now,

10:11.133 --> 10:13.167
because we need to help Abe!

10:13.167 --> 10:15.833
[mocking] Because we
need to help Abe.

10:15.833 --> 10:17.767
Phew, ch-ooh, boy,

10:17.767 --> 10:20.167
I don't know if I want
a hamburger, a hot dog,

10:20.167 --> 10:22.567
chili, or all of the above.

10:22.567 --> 10:24.833
Can you eliminate
two of the options?

10:24.833 --> 10:27.800
If you can, just go ahead
and take a guess.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.867
Chances are,
that's what you wanted.

10:30.867 --> 10:34.200
It makes sense
because it's real.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.067
[groaning]

10:36.067 --> 10:38.400
So here's what I was thinking.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.700
You'll read the prep book to me
while I catch some shut-eye.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.933
But...I was
kind of hoping we could--

10:42.933 --> 10:45.400
I can't wait
until this test is over.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.967
We'll finally have
some time just to talk

10:47.967 --> 10:49.333
and snuggle and stuff.

The end.

11:01.967 --> 11:05.300
Oh, morning.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.533
Huh.

11:06.533 --> 11:09.367
I don't think
I retained anything.

some precious cargo.

11:19.733 --> 11:21.467
What?
What is it?

11:21.467 --> 11:23.467
Your future, Gandhi.

11:23.467 --> 11:24.733
Oh, man.

11:24.733 --> 11:26.233
You mean there's nothing
on this truck

11:26.233 --> 11:28.133
but a stinking metaphor?

11:28.133 --> 11:29.633
I expected more veracity

11:29.633 --> 11:31.933
from such a sagacious hauler
of commodities.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.233
Oh, my God.

PXJT words.

11:39.067 --> 11:42.633
Now if you'll excuse me,
I just ate a chili dog,

11:42.633 --> 11:45.633
so I got to drop off
some more precious cargo.

Come out, Abe.
We need to talk.

12:44.700 --> 12:45.900
(Abe)
No!

12:45.900 --> 12:48.400
I slept through
the whole PXJT!

I just need
to date a guy

to Clone State.

12:52.067 --> 12:55.200
Cleo, did you see me
on that test?

12:55.200 --> 12:56.667
I smoked it.

I can't wait
to see my time.

(Abe)
Beat it, JFK.

13:00.233 --> 13:01.267
The girl is mine.

13:01.267 --> 13:04.900
No, no.
The doggone girl is mine!

13:04.900 --> 13:07.833
We appear to be
at an impasse.

13:07.833 --> 13:11.100
Then we'll settle this
like gentlemen--

13:11.100 --> 13:13.100
with a drag race!

Cleo's not some prize
you can win in a drag race.

This isn't the 1950s.

13:18.533 --> 13:20.167
Or is it?
I'm really tired!

13:20.167 --> 13:23.600
Guys, I'm a modern woman
who makes decisions for herself,

13:23.600 --> 13:26.233
and this decision will be based
on who can drive faster.

13:26.233 --> 13:28.233
Then we'll race
tonight!

of the number two pencil lead

What's this?

a number two pencil!

13:50.300 --> 13:51.433
Oh, my.

13:51.433 --> 13:54.467
Is this a number three pencil?

13:54.467 --> 13:56.467
My bad.

13:56.467 --> 13:59.867
Mr. B!
I should have known it was you.

13:59.867 --> 14:01.933
Who else would know
that the number three pencil

14:01.933 --> 14:03.767

I wish.

14:18.467 --> 14:19.933
I wish.

14:19.933 --> 14:22.267
This is an intervention,
Abe.

14:22.267 --> 14:24.833
You have a problem,
and it needs to stop.

14:24.833 --> 14:27.100
I just need to stay up
a few more hours.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.067
So you can stay up
a few more hours after that.

14:29.067 --> 14:31.500
I'll sleep when I die.

I was so excited

about seeing the movie
American Pie

14:38.633 --> 14:40.867
that I couldn't sleep
the night before?

14:40.867 --> 14:44.567
And remember that scene where
the guy has sex with the pie?

14:44.567 --> 14:46.233
Well, I don't,

14:46.233 --> 14:50.167
because I fell asleep
in the theater.

Why didn't you just rent it?

been tantalizingly close

15:01.300 --> 15:04.200
to revealing for too long.

You know how I was
at camp last summer?

It was a sleepaway camp.

with sleeping problems.

At first, I used to stay up
just socially,

15:54.967 --> 15:57.067
but--but then I'd cut class
to sneak out

15:57.067 --> 15:59.067
to the parking lot
and stay awake.

15:59.067 --> 16:02.800
Finally, they found me one day,
faceup in the gutter,

16:02.800 --> 16:04.667
wide awake!

16:04.667 --> 16:06.433
And there's something else.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.967
There's--
[gasps]

16:07.967 --> 16:09.400
There's this.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.800
My judgment was so poor
due to sleep deprivation

16:12.800 --> 16:15.300
that I actually paid money
for this!

16:15.300 --> 16:19.267
Joan, I had no idea.

19:17.467 --> 19:20.200
Thanks, Joan,
wherever you are.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.833
I'm right here.

19:21.833 --> 19:25.767
So you are, Joan.
So you are.

19:25.767 --> 19:28.433
So what do you want
to do on our date?

19:28.433 --> 19:32.467
I was thinking
we could sleep together.

19:32.467 --> 19:35.433
[both laughing]

19:35.433 --> 19:37.467
Oh, funny.

19:37.467 --> 19:40.567
No, seriously,
can we sleep together?

19:40.567 --> 19:41.767
Hey, creepy trucker.

19:41.767 --> 19:43.600
I aced the PXJTs.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.967
I aced 'em!

19:44.967 --> 19:47.433
Maybe some day you'll be
a Rhodes scholar

19:47.433 --> 19:48.433
like me.

19:48.433 --> 19:50.300
Ha-ha, good pun.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.600
Pun?
Heck, no.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.633
I studied at Oxford.

19:54.633 --> 19:57.167
Truckers don't make puns,
Gandhi.

19:57.167 --> 19:58.400
We make deliveries.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.800
But wait.
I never got your name.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.633
The name's...

20:02.633 --> 20:03.800
[echoing]
Prepcourse.

20:03.800 --> 20:04.967
But...

20:04.967 --> 20:08.400
Doug Prepcourse died
40 years ago.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.200
[gasps]

20:10.200 --> 20:13.200
[eerie music]

20:13.200 --> 20:17.567
*

20:17.567 --> 20:19.067
[echoing]
Keep on truckin', Gandhi.

20:19.067 --> 20:21.033
[slurps]

20:21.033 --> 20:22.367
Keep on truckin'.

20:24.167 --> 20:27.567
(narrator)
Next week, on a very special
Clone High...

20:27.567 --> 20:30.167
A mysterious male stranger
comes to town,

20:30.167 --> 20:31.867
and he's brought
a surprise ending with him

20:31.867 --> 20:33.433
that will shock you.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.667
Will her secret--
wait, did I just say "her"?

20:36.667 --> 20:40.033
Oh, boy, that was the one thing
I wasn't supposed to tell you.

20:40.033 --> 20:41.500
I ruin everything!

20:41.500 --> 20:43.267
Like when I spoiled
The Sixth Sense

20:43.267 --> 20:44.633
for my friend Steve.

20:44.633 --> 20:47.367
He specifically asked me
to not reveal the end.

20:47.367 --> 20:51.133
Stupid, really stupid!

20:51.133 --> 20:53.367
Why do we do this live?

20:53.367 --> 20:56.000
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

20:56.000 --> 20:58.933
* Secret government
employees *

20:58.933 --> 21:01.733
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

21:01.733 --> 21:04.733
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

21:04.733 --> 21:07.633
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

21:07.633 --> 21:10.600
* They're gonna make
it if they try *

21:10.600 --> 21:13.467
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

21:13.467 --> 21:19.700
* Time to laugh and
shiver and cry *

21:19.700 --> 21:22.867
* Clone High
