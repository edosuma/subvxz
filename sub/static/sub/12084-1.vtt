00:21.280 --> 00:23.874
BOY: I want to get a good picture,

00:25.480 --> 00:27.994
some more pictures.

00:31.960 --> 00:34.872
This is Carey's room, her bed.

00:35.720 --> 00:41.795
This is the birthday girl's mattress
and everything else.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.159
She's even got a TV

00:43.200 --> 00:44.428
in her room.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.708
Ain't she lucky?

00:46.840 --> 00:48.876
That's my sister.

00:51.560 --> 00:53.118
The birthday girl.

00:53.960 --> 00:55.916
Ain't she beautiful?

00:56.440 --> 00:59.159
And here is her brother.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.553
Nick.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.949
WOMAN: The thought of what somebody
could have done to him...

01:19.640 --> 01:21.232
It gives you nightmares.

01:23.440 --> 01:24.919
It really does.

01:29.720 --> 01:32.518
ANOTHER WOMAN:
His disappearance never made the news.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.552
It wasn't news to them,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.116
it was just news to us.

01:47.960 --> 01:53.034
It came to the point where, you know,
you're not gonna find him alive,

01:53.080 --> 01:56.197
but you just want to
find what happened to him.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.916
(Pouring rain)

02:42.360 --> 02:45.636
MOTHER:
They called me at work when I wasn't there

02:45.680 --> 02:51.437
and they wrote a message and said,
"Someone from Spain has Nicholas."

02:52.160 --> 02:54.196
He wants to come home.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.514
My mom called me.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.312
I was at work.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.554
And she says, "Sitting down?

02:58.600 --> 03:00.079
You're not going to believe this."

03:00.120 --> 03:03.192
Course. It was mysterious,

03:03.240 --> 03:05.470
it was er...exciting,

03:05.560 --> 03:06.913
it was worrisome,

03:06.960 --> 03:10.191
er, it was all mixed emotions, you know?

03:10.240 --> 03:11.832
Ecstatic.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.552
Bewildered.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.715
You know, Spain!

03:14.760 --> 03:16.398
Isn't that like across the country?

03:16.440 --> 03:18.635
Um, how did he get there?

03:18.680 --> 03:21.638
You want...
you have like a hundred thousand questions

03:21.720 --> 03:23.392
that you want answered immediately.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.119
I felt wonderful,

03:27.520 --> 03:29.590
you know, excited.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.715
You wanna see him, touch him,
you know what I mean?

03:33.760 --> 03:36.672
And you want it all to happen now.

03:59.720 --> 04:00.914
(Pouring rain)

04:53.520 --> 04:57.479
From as long as I remember,
I wanted to be someone else.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.870
Someone who was acceptable.

05:06.520 --> 05:07.919
(Siren)

05:13.520 --> 05:17.308
The most important thing for me and what
I learned very fast was to be convincing.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.359
When the police arrive,

05:24.400 --> 05:26.391
I have immediately to put into their mind

05:26.440 --> 05:28.715
they have a kid in front of them,
not an adult.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.672
So it was very important for me
to behave like one.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.836
(Communications over police radio)

05:48.360 --> 05:49.679
(Speaks Spanish)

05:51.240 --> 05:54.630
(Continues to speak Spanish)

05:54.680 --> 05:58.468
They would see me with...
in a big coat with younger clothes.

05:58.840 --> 06:03.038
And they would see a kid with a hat,
which is very low in the eyes.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.308
They couldn't see my eyes.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.795
(Speaks Spanish)

06:09.720 --> 06:12.359
I wanted to provoke on them
a sense of guilt...

06:14.160 --> 06:16.594
(Speaks Spanish)

06:16.640 --> 06:20.918
..of being adults and to be close to a kid
which is dead scared.

06:21.960 --> 06:25.191
When you see a kid that,
you know, got nervous reflexes,

06:25.240 --> 06:27.959
that you can't touch them,
you can't approach them,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.276
then you understand, you understand
that something is wrong.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.390
(Speaks Spanish)

06:36.520 --> 06:38.636
(Speaks Spanish)

06:47.280 --> 06:50.829
I wasn't the one who was telling them
I've been sexually abused.

06:50.880 --> 06:53.997
I made them ask me that by my attitude,

06:54.040 --> 06:55.837
by my way of doing things.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.997
They were the one thinking about it
and that gave me power.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.192
I didn't speak much.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.035
(Woman speaks Spanish)

07:25.080 --> 07:31.030
It's very hard to read a kid
that doesn't speak a word sometime.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.913
(Speaks Spanish)

07:38.080 --> 07:39.991
(Speaks Spanish)

07:40.040 --> 07:42.600
If a cop don't know who a kid is
and where he comes from,

07:42.640 --> 07:44.835
he just can't keep him
in the police station.

07:46.400 --> 07:50.951
And I knew that eventually they would
have to put me into a children's home...

07:51.000 --> 07:52.672
(Speaks Spanish)

07:52.720 --> 07:55.359
..and that's all I wanted.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.195
Nobody ever gave a damn about me

08:15.240 --> 08:19.711
and to know that if I change my identity

08:19.760 --> 08:22.228
the reward was eventually
to be put in a place

08:22.280 --> 08:24.555
where actually
they really cared about me...

08:25.080 --> 08:28.436
then, hell, yeah.
I mean, I was reborn.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.391
I mean... (Laughs) ..I was born again.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.958
Nobody ever gave me a childhood,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.309
because to give a kid a childhood
you need to, to love that kid.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.951
I felt like I belonged there.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.510
(Speaks Spanish)

08:54.600 --> 08:59.037
They didn't know
that I was 23, 23 years old.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.429
I was considered like one of them.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.471
BEVERLY: I told him to be home by dinner

09:23.520 --> 09:26.956
and gave him five bucks
to go play basketball,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.070
and... he took off.

09:31.720 --> 09:35.156
He called home, asking for a ride, er...

09:35.200 --> 09:36.918
which was probably, I don't know,

09:36.960 --> 09:39.315
he's within a couple of miles
from his house

09:39.360 --> 09:44.036
and his mother works late
and sleeps during the day

09:44.080 --> 09:49.234
and his older brother Jason
answered the phone.

09:49.280 --> 09:55.037
When I woke up Jason was there and said
that he had called and wanted a ride home,

09:55.080 --> 09:57.150
but Jason didn't want to wake me up,

09:58.080 --> 10:00.389
so told him he had to walk home.

10:02.400 --> 10:08.316
And that's...was the day,
the last time we heard from him.

10:10.760 --> 10:15.709
You spend 24 hours crying, sick, worried,

10:16.560 --> 10:19.279
then you get mad, then you get scared,

10:19.360 --> 10:22.033
and then you try to get empowered.
You know, "OK, what can we do?

10:22.080 --> 10:24.071
We have to do flyers,
we'll do this, we'll..."

10:24.160 --> 10:25.434
You know, so instead of...

10:25.480 --> 10:30.554
you don't cry, you do something positive

10:30.600 --> 10:33.956
and try to work towards, I guess,
a solution of finding him.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.189
BEVERLY: I thought somebody offered him
a ride, and he got in the car.

10:42.920 --> 10:46.435
I dunno, I think he would have got in a car
with someone that he didn't know.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.076
What are you looking at?

10:56.320 --> 10:59.790
I could see the worry and the pain
they were going through,

10:59.840 --> 11:03.549
so I always said, you know,
"He's out there," you know.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.238
"He'll resurface," you know.

11:19.640 --> 11:25.670
Unfortunately for me, it was one of
those places which is very rare in Spain

11:25.760 --> 11:30.072
where actually they can't stand
having a kid with no identity card,

11:30.120 --> 11:32.190
er, no proof of who he is.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.356
(Woman speaks Spanish)

11:38.920 --> 11:42.674
They wanted absolutely to know who I was,
where do I come from,

11:42.720 --> 11:45.234
erm, they needed to know precise.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.953
(Woman continues in Spanish)

11:49.360 --> 11:52.477
"If you don't tell us,
if can't prove us who you are,

11:52.520 --> 11:55.193
I'm gonna have you fingerprinted
and your pictures taken."

11:56.880 --> 11:58.950
I couldn't allow that to happen.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.434
I had to find a way out of that.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.597
So the only, only thing left there was

12:04.640 --> 12:06.710
was 1) go to prison

12:06.960 --> 12:10.919
2) prove to them that I'm someone.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.390
I said that I was American.

12:23.200 --> 12:28.797
That er...I ran away and I was
willing to contact my family for them

12:28.840 --> 12:30.990
but I wanted to do it myself.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.236
I didn't want my family to receive a phone call
from the police or the persecutor

12:37.280 --> 12:38.918
or the judge in Spain.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.359
I wanted to do it myself.

12:41.240 --> 12:43.879
And I said I would need to be
in the office for the night

12:43.920 --> 12:45.353
because I live in the States.

12:45.400 --> 12:48.949
The States is, you know,
the times is different, it's er...

12:49.000 --> 12:52.231
So erm, you know,
just leave me in the office

12:52.280 --> 12:54.191
and tomorrow you will have all you need.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.279
(Speaks Spanish)

13:14.120 --> 13:16.190
In this office nobody could hear me.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.515
I knew that I could pass myself
for anyone on the phone,

13:21.560 --> 13:23.118
could convince anyone of anything.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.517
So I call the American Police.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.959
(Phone rings)

13:38.000 --> 13:39.718
County South, Detective Fowler.

13:39.760 --> 13:40.795
The New York Police.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.039
Lieutenant Kojak's office.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.755
Different police stations in the States.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.832
- Dobie here.
- Who is this, please?

13:48.880 --> 13:51.440
I told them every time
that I was a policeman from Spain

13:51.520 --> 13:53.636
called Jonathan Dorian,

13:53.680 --> 13:55.398
that we had found a kid,

13:56.200 --> 13:59.272
we are sure he's from the States
but we don't know where.

13:59.320 --> 14:00.469
How long ago was this?

14:00.520 --> 14:04.957
He's been maybe missing for a few years,
that someone must be looking for him.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.434
So the police say, well, you know,

14:08.480 --> 14:11.677
we got hundreds of posters
of missing persons on the wall

14:11.720 --> 14:13.915
and we just can't go through each of them.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.632
But what we can do for you

14:15.680 --> 14:19.355
is to give you the number of the centre
for missing and exploited children

14:19.400 --> 14:20.879
of Arlington, Virginia.

14:27.920 --> 14:31.674
Centre for missing and exploited children.
Lorraine speaking. How may I help you?

14:33.560 --> 14:37.348
Er, we have a kid in a shelter,
certainly is American,

14:37.400 --> 14:39.311
who is about 14, 15 years old

14:39.360 --> 14:41.669
but the problem is
we don't know who he is...

14:41.720 --> 14:43.073
I describe myself.

14:43.120 --> 14:46.635
Every detail I gave was details
that I know that I could handle.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.795
I wanted to be vague enough for her
to look at many different things.

14:50.840 --> 14:53.308
I wanted her to have many possibilities.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.588
Let me just take a look here.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.471
"I got maybe something," she said.

14:56.520 --> 15:00.513
"Maybe, you know,
we got a kid from San Antonio

15:00.560 --> 15:03.632
missing since June 13 1994.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.875
His name is Nicholas Barclay."

15:05.920 --> 15:08.957
I said, "Could you send me a fax
of what he looks like?"

15:10.680 --> 15:15.674
In my head, I was just a police officer
with, with Nicholas Barclay next to me,

15:15.720 --> 15:20.316
trying to confirm his identity
and like any other policeman would do.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.916
Let's see if it's him.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.156
I thought, let's see if it's him.

15:36.200 --> 15:39.795
I look at it, black and white picture,
old picture.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.312
Well, missing for three or four years,

15:44.360 --> 15:47.432
guarantee one thing,
there will be a change.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.151
If there is a change, there will be doubt.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.668
If there is doubt, then I got a chance.

15:54.960 --> 16:00.876
Something in my head decided
I could do it, that I had to try.

16:06.680 --> 16:11.435
I took the phone and I told her
that this is Nicholas.

16:11.480 --> 16:13.311
We got him, it's him.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.316
It's incredible, it's him.

16:28.840 --> 16:31.673
My mom called me
and she says, "Are you sitting down?

16:31.720 --> 16:33.676
You're not gonna believe this."

16:33.760 --> 16:36.797
And I said, "What, Mom?" She goes,
"The police department called me

16:36.840 --> 16:39.877
and they think they found Nicholas
in Linares."

16:39.920 --> 16:42.912
So I'm like, "OK,
where in Texas is Linares?"

16:42.960 --> 16:45.076
Because Texas has a lot of small towns.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.077
And then she was like, "No, Spain."

16:47.120 --> 16:48.394
I'm like, "Spain?"

16:51.720 --> 16:53.790
Oh, God, how to explain the emotions.

16:54.600 --> 16:58.070
It's like all these different emotions,
from excitement to bewilderment,

16:58.120 --> 16:59.997
to what do we do?

17:00.040 --> 17:03.828
What's the next step? How do we get him?
When do we get to talk to him?

17:06.040 --> 17:08.873
I knew that after that
they would contact me.

17:08.920 --> 17:13.357
They would try to verify, to call,
to see, to... Is it true? Is it here?

17:13.400 --> 17:15.550
Is it, you know...
Carey, the family and all that.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.390
(Ringing tone)

17:25.200 --> 17:28.157
Well, when I first got, you know,
got a hold of the shelter,

17:28.200 --> 17:31.158
they put me on the phone
with Jonathan Dorian

17:31.200 --> 17:34.158
who said that he worked
for the, a shelter,

17:34.240 --> 17:37.596
and that he was the one
who was talking with Nicholas

17:37.640 --> 17:41.189
and had got the information from Nicholas
on who he really was.

17:44.160 --> 17:47.914
When she called, I said that Nicholas
was seated next to me.

17:47.960 --> 17:51.350
But he was very scared,
he was very traumatised

17:51.400 --> 17:53.072
and he didn't want to talk to no-one.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.680
He sounded very responsible,
very concerned.

17:55.720 --> 17:59.269
Er, he claims that he has been abused,
that he's been hurt,

17:59.320 --> 18:02.437
that erm...certainly he's been abducted.

18:02.480 --> 18:06.109
I kind of thought he was like
a social worker type of person.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.628
Um, very reassuring.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.116
She said, "Is he saying anything?

18:11.160 --> 18:13.276
Is he talking about us? Does he remember?"

18:13.320 --> 18:16.630
Well, actually, I think he forgot
about everything, you know.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.477
He doesn't remember very much.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.715
He remember you but not very much.

18:20.760 --> 18:25.914
We were told he was held by
some kind of like a sex slave kind of ring,

18:25.960 --> 18:31.318
and that he had escaped from there and
that he was found wandering the streets.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.352
She was heartbroken
but at the same time she was very happy.

18:34.400 --> 18:35.992
I wanted to hear his voice.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.359
No!

18:37.400 --> 18:41.837
Absolutely, there was no way I was going
to talk to her pretending to be Nicholas

18:41.880 --> 18:45.395
because I wasn't Nicholas
and she was his sister,

18:45.440 --> 18:48.796
so er...it would have been a risk,

18:48.840 --> 18:50.637
too big a risk for me,

18:50.680 --> 18:52.477
but I did say a few words.

18:53.640 --> 18:56.518
She said: "Hello, Nicholas.
You hear me, Nicholas?"

18:58.960 --> 19:00.951
Nothing.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.552
"I love you, Nicholas.
I want to take you back home with me.

19:04.600 --> 19:05.828
I'm gonna take you, baby.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.871
I'm gonna come and get you and..."

19:10.560 --> 19:15.350
And maybe you hear "Love you"
or something like that, you know.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.319
Very far away. It, it...

19:17.360 --> 19:19.237
And then she say: "Was it him?"

19:19.280 --> 19:21.077
I said, "Yeah. He said 'I love you."'

19:21.360 --> 19:23.396
Oh. And then she started crying
on the phone.

19:24.680 --> 19:29.117
You start crying, you tell him, "We're
going to come and get you, bring you home.

19:29.160 --> 19:32.436
We'll get there, we're going to bring
you home, and I love you too."

19:35.320 --> 19:37.914
I erm... I washed her brain.

19:53.320 --> 19:57.598
I didn't stop,
because I didn't think of stopping.

19:58.840 --> 20:02.674
I didn't watch myself in the mirror
and say, "What the fuck are you doing?

20:02.720 --> 20:04.711
Stop that immediately."

20:10.840 --> 20:12.831
(Footsteps)

20:13.160 --> 20:16.869
I realised that I've crossed the line.

20:18.520 --> 20:23.640
I wasn't pretending no more
to have another identity. I stole one.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.308
(Phone rings)

20:38.480 --> 20:42.075
I got a phone call: "Would you please
call a Carey Gibson?"

20:44.400 --> 20:46.550
Well, I was astounded by what Carey said,

20:48.760 --> 20:52.275
so one of the first things I said to her was,

20:52.320 --> 20:56.677
when the FBI
and the US State Department assist you

20:56.720 --> 21:01.919
and uh...get you and your brother back here,
I have to interview him immediately.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.400
When the welfare of a minor,

21:11.440 --> 21:12.998
er...is in jeopardy,

21:13.480 --> 21:15.994
our reaction has to be very quick,

21:16.040 --> 21:17.598
er...very responsive.

21:17.640 --> 21:18.834
We have to put ourselves

21:18.880 --> 21:20.074
in the position of the child

21:20.120 --> 21:22.111
or the child's parents or guardians.

21:22.760 --> 21:25.911
Generally when a child is missing for years,

21:25.960 --> 21:30.954
either the child is dead or the child is not found

21:31.000 --> 21:35.755
and to find that child in another country
is extremely rare.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.192
That made it all the more compelling for us

21:39.240 --> 21:42.915
to make sure that we did everything right
in terms of er...

21:42.960 --> 21:45.997
establishing who he was
and getting him back to his family.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.917
My main concern was getting him back,

21:47.960 --> 21:51.509
so that my part could start,
the investigation could start...

21:51.640 --> 21:53.949
we could find out
what had happened to this child.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.070
I sent somebody out there
as quickly as possible.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.868
The next day...
The next day, it got beyond my control.

22:10.760 --> 22:14.150
The centre for missing
and exploited children sent me a flyer.

22:14.920 --> 22:18.151
There was the picture of Nicholas
at the time of his disappearance...

22:22.040 --> 22:26.477
And I saw what real Nicholas looked like,
really with colours and everything.

22:29.360 --> 22:31.510
He was very blond, very...

22:31.560 --> 22:33.790
He had blue eyes.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.796
He looked nothing like me!

22:36.320 --> 22:37.469
Nothing!

22:37.520 --> 22:40.512
There's, you know, the only thing
he had in common with me

22:40.560 --> 22:42.835
was that he had five fingers
at each hands.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.750
Then I said, fuck, let's burn myself.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.391
You know, I burned the flyer.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.510
If I could have burned the identity that I said

22:51.560 --> 22:54.199
and every word that had been
out of my mouth for the past few days,

22:54.240 --> 22:55.912
I would have burned them too!

23:02.480 --> 23:06.314
When everyone tells me
that the American Embassy is coming

23:06.360 --> 23:08.954
and er...everybody's, you know...

23:09.000 --> 23:11.468
and don't worry, Nicholas,
we're gonna take care of you.

23:11.520 --> 23:16.548
Well, yeah, OK,
you know, I... I couldn't do nothing.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.274
The only thing I could do

23:18.320 --> 23:21.471
was think of how was going to be the prison
where I was going to be.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.199
I didn't know what to do.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.196
I really didn't know what to do.

23:35.560 --> 23:38.233
When the Vice Consul
first arrived in Linares,

23:38.280 --> 23:41.238
he got to the centre and found
Nicholas Barclay had disappeared.

23:47.280 --> 23:48.793
I said, you've got to find him.

23:50.360 --> 23:54.273
So he essentially,
with somebody from the Linares Centre,

23:54.320 --> 23:56.356
went around looking for him.

23:57.440 --> 24:01.638
Our priority was his safety and to make sure
he was reunited with the family.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.756
I tried to run away
like I would do anywhere else.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.239
Nicholas Barclay?

24:17.000 --> 24:18.991
God didn't want me to leave this place.

24:19.440 --> 24:23.353
I spoke with the vice consul and asked him
about his interactions with Nicholas.

24:23.400 --> 24:27.234
He reported at the time
that he spoke English,

24:27.760 --> 24:32.390
that he, he was,
he was at least at that moment

24:32.440 --> 24:34.112
convinced that this was an American.

24:42.360 --> 24:45.193
When I woke up the next morning,
everything was normal.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.958
(Knock at door)

24:50.120 --> 24:53.157
Then I saw the director of the shelter
that said,

24:53.200 --> 24:56.510
"Well, you know, you must be happy,
your sister is on the way."

24:57.080 --> 24:59.355
So I said, "What do you mean?"

24:59.400 --> 25:03.712
He say, "Well, your sister,
you know, from San Antonio,

25:03.760 --> 25:06.194
she's on the plane,
she's coming to get you."

25:08.960 --> 25:10.393
Fuck, you know. Fuck! Fuck!

25:10.440 --> 25:11.589
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

25:11.640 --> 25:13.198
I'd never left the country.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.708
I didn't know even what it entailed.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.998
I knew Mom couldn't handle the flight.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.473
She can't, she couldn't do it.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.873
I have to do this.

25:24.920 --> 25:28.071
I just gotta go get him
and get him back here where he's safe.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.237
I should have thought of that.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.595
I should have thought of the consequences.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.631
If you do that, imagine for a second

25:38.680 --> 25:43.037
that you're the father of a kid that's
been missing for three years, four months,

25:43.080 --> 25:46.356
and that they find him in Columbia,
er...what would you do?

25:46.480 --> 25:48.311
What would be the first thing you'd do?

25:48.800 --> 25:50.791
I would jump on a fucking plane.

25:53.280 --> 25:56.238
I didn't sleep for two days
before I got on the plane.

25:56.280 --> 25:59.272
Fear, but also anticipation,

25:59.640 --> 26:01.278
cos you want to get there, get there.

26:01.320 --> 26:04.915
You want to see him, hold him,
smell him, just get there.

26:05.600 --> 26:10.116
You can't prepare to play a role
of a person that you don't know.

26:11.440 --> 26:14.955
I couldn't be Nicholas Barclay
because I didn't know Nicholas Barclay.

26:15.600 --> 26:18.512
I didn't even know at that moment
if he was left or right-handed.

26:19.120 --> 26:22.032
So, er, that was a problem.

26:22.760 --> 26:26.150
I got on the plane and tried to sleep.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.838
Didn't work.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.951
(Nick's voice)

26:48.960 --> 26:50.951
The director...

26:54.240 --> 26:56.754
This is Nick, mwhah.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.552
BEVERLY: He thought he was an adult.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.592
We called him 13 going on 30.

27:08.400 --> 27:10.755
Very difficult to discipline him.

27:11.520 --> 27:14.637
If he made up his mind
he was gonna do something,

27:14.680 --> 27:17.638
pretty much there wasn't a lot you could do.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.991
Put the lighter down.

27:22.320 --> 27:25.118
CAREY: He'd run away before
for a night or two, mad at Mom.

27:25.160 --> 27:27.469
"I'm leaving, I'll find a new mom, a new home.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.232
Kiss my ass," kind of thing.

27:29.280 --> 27:33.034
And he, you know... would leave
and she would hunt him down

27:33.080 --> 27:36.072
and find out where he is
and he'd show up the next day.

27:37.040 --> 27:42.831
He was not, um, you know,
this perfect nice sweet innocent,

27:42.920 --> 27:46.276
he was a very street-smart city boy.

27:49.280 --> 27:54.149
- It's nice to meet ya. I am the director.
- In here, Nick.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.191
See, ain't I beautiful?

27:56.560 --> 27:59.120
He had beautiful blond hair.

27:59.160 --> 28:01.833
Kind of looked like, erm, a little pixie.

28:02.360 --> 28:05.477
He had blond hair and blue eyes
and a bit of a gap between his teeth.

28:05.520 --> 28:07.511
When he smiled, you could see it.

28:31.080 --> 28:34.834
Finally I'm on the ground.
"Who, who, who am I looking for?

28:34.880 --> 28:36.757
What do they look like? Are they in suits?

28:36.800 --> 28:38.677
Oh, damn, you can smoke here. Thank God!"

28:40.840 --> 28:42.114
The air smelt different.

28:42.160 --> 28:45.197
Erm,
it was a lot less crowded than I thought.

28:54.800 --> 28:58.873
I did everything I could
to give myself a chance.

29:02.840 --> 29:06.913
I bought product to colour my hair totally blond.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.876
The gentlemen and a lady approached me,

29:11.920 --> 29:14.195
cos I wasn't sure where to go

29:14.240 --> 29:16.708
and we went straight into a car
and started driving.

29:21.800 --> 29:25.349
On the flyers it said that Nicholas Barclay
had three tattoos.

29:28.040 --> 29:32.238
There was a girl inside the shelter
that did small tattoos just like that.

29:32.280 --> 29:34.191
She was no pro, she was just a kid.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.271
And I asked her to put those tattoos

29:36.320 --> 29:38.151
that were on the flyers on me.

29:46.360 --> 29:50.956
I was quiet and that's when
the lady started talking to me.

29:52.840 --> 29:57.231
She kept my mind busy
with explaining the countryside to me

29:57.320 --> 29:59.311
the whole way down there on the drive.

30:03.080 --> 30:09.315
I took big sunglasses, I took a hat,
I took a scarf, I took a glove.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.518
I thought that if she couldn't see me,

30:11.560 --> 30:14.233
then she wouldn't be able to say
I'm not her brother.

30:16.080 --> 30:19.277
We stopped for a Coca-Cola,
which I thought was really cool.

30:19.320 --> 30:23.757
They had coke there and it was
the anxiety of how long it was taking.

30:25.400 --> 30:30.474
Minutes before she arrived
I was convinced it was finished.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.871
That I was gonna get arrested
and maybe beat up also

30:33.920 --> 30:36.070
because they were
not going to be happy about it.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.954
I remember going into like a waiting area.

30:40.280 --> 30:44.956
I'm speaking with a couple of people from
the home saying that he was in his room.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.719
He'd been locked in his room all day.
He wouldn't let anyone go in.

30:47.760 --> 30:51.070
Finally when I heard someone
knocking at the door and saying,

30:51.120 --> 30:55.193
"Hey, Nicholas, your sister is downstairs,

30:55.240 --> 30:57.356
er...she's waiting for you, she's there..."

30:58.920 --> 31:01.150
CAREY: I went downstairs
and into like a courtyard.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.919
There were some kids playing
like ball against a wall

31:03.960 --> 31:06.997
and looked up at the window
and told him,

31:07.040 --> 31:09.873
"I'm here, come here. I want to see you,
I want to hold you."

31:09.920 --> 31:13.435
I remember seeing him look out the window.

31:14.280 --> 31:18.273
I was sure that as soon as the sister
was gonna see me,

31:18.560 --> 31:21.518
she was going to say
"What the fuck is that?" You know.

31:21.560 --> 31:23.551
That's not...that's not Nicholas.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.191
I waited maybe 10 minutes.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.678
I knew I was about to lose everything.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.952
I knew I couldn't wait no more,

31:36.000 --> 31:37.433
that I couldn't go away,

31:37.480 --> 31:39.277
that I couldn't just disappear,

31:39.320 --> 31:41.595
so I opened the door and I went down.

31:46.320 --> 31:49.915
It was just this sense of immense relief.

31:50.840 --> 31:54.913
Just seeing, touching,
kissing, holding him.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.196
I said, "What the hell?" You know.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.953
He's here, we're here, I have him.

32:01.440 --> 32:04.716
She didn't even wait a second
or two seconds.

32:04.760 --> 32:06.910
She jump on me, she jump on me,

32:06.960 --> 32:08.518
she took me in her arms

32:08.560 --> 32:12.758
and she said, "Nicholas, oh, and you
were afraid I wouldn't recognise you.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.597
I would remember that nose."

32:14.640 --> 32:19.077
So I just... I remember touching his nose
and telling him, um,

32:19.120 --> 32:22.396
"I remember that nose,
you kind of look like your Uncle Pat."

32:23.080 --> 32:27.596
She said, "Don't worry," like she always say,
"everything is going to be fine.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.392
Everything is going to be perfect.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.271
I know it's you."

32:31.920 --> 32:34.559
He was just...just basically
told me he loved me,

32:34.600 --> 32:39.390
and he didn't say a whole lot
until all the people left.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.832
Only God know why she would
do something like that,

32:44.880 --> 32:52.389
but...but I know one thing for sure
is there was no other way.

32:52.440 --> 32:55.034
She came for me and she wanted me back.

32:57.440 --> 33:03.037
We went to the visit room
and she showed me dozens of pictures.

33:03.760 --> 33:05.751
Pictures, pictures, pictures.

33:06.360 --> 33:10.148
You remember, this was with Mom
at the, at the house we were living in

33:10.200 --> 33:12.111
before you, you went missing.

33:12.200 --> 33:15.670
Remember this was
when you were playing with Scotty.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.711
Remember this was...

33:19.240 --> 33:23.438
And he was like, "Jason looks the same,
Codey's gotten pretty big, huh?

33:23.640 --> 33:27.155
Mom, God, Mom looks exactly the same.
Has she put on weight?

33:28.240 --> 33:30.629
Wanted to know if Grandpa
was still an asshole,

33:30.680 --> 33:33.911
um, told me how much he loved Grandma
and he missed her.

33:35.240 --> 33:38.152
I remember seeing the tattoo,
the cross between his, you know,

33:38.200 --> 33:39.519
right here on his hand.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.597
I just kept thinking
how much he looks like Uncle Pat

33:42.640 --> 33:45.837
and how mom was going to be
really surprised how tall he was.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.914
She said that he looked very different,

33:50.960 --> 33:52.996
that he had, you know, grown up...

33:54.720 --> 33:57.075
..and erm...

33:57.120 --> 34:02.672
he's very quiet,
you know, kinda held back.

34:02.720 --> 34:05.439
He talked with a funny accent.

34:05.480 --> 34:09.393
But it was always a whisper and very quiet
like he was hiding from something.

34:13.159 --> 34:15.469
I mean, God,
look what he had been through.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.591
He wasn't the same person.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.518
He wasn't the same Nicholas
that disappeared four years before.

34:20.560 --> 34:23.552
He had been held and tortured
and God knows what else.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.591
He wasn't that same person.

34:31.760 --> 34:36.231
The judge in Linares wanted to make sure
that there was in fact some legal basis

34:36.280 --> 34:41.149
for Nicholas claiming to be er...
Carey Gibson's lost brother.

34:41.480 --> 34:48.476
So now the problem was that they
had the sister and the embassy official

34:48.520 --> 34:51.431
that were swearing
that I was Nicholas Barclay

34:51.480 --> 34:54.438
and there was the police
and the prosecutor

34:54.480 --> 34:57.313
and the judge
who were not convinced at all.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.635
The judge insisted on separate interviews

34:59.680 --> 35:06.711
and part of the evidence that was in those
interviews was a family photo album.

35:08.120 --> 35:11.237
And the judge said, "Listen,
the only way for you to prove

35:11.280 --> 35:14.272
that you're really Nicholas
is we got pictures here

35:14.320 --> 35:16.117
that you've never seen before.

35:19.280 --> 35:21.271
I'm gonna show you five of them."

35:22.600 --> 35:24.591
Number one, OK.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.672
Number two, OK.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.278
Number three, OK.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.958
Number four, OK.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.353
On the five one I made a mistake,

35:34.160 --> 35:35.479
but it was too late.

35:35.520 --> 35:37.795
She was already convinced
I was Nicholas Barclay.

35:38.480 --> 35:39.959
(Speaks Spanish)

35:44.320 --> 35:49.838
At that point I didn't see how I could
not document him as a US citizen.

35:54.240 --> 35:59.189
I would not have been able to do anything
if Carey didn't show me those pictures.

36:01.360 --> 36:05.353
They took picture of me,
with no hat, with nothing.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.034
Which was, you know, they saw my eyes.

36:08.920 --> 36:13.471
Erm, the constitution of the United States.
I swear to be a US citizen.

36:14.360 --> 36:17.033
You know, it wasn't real but I did it.

36:40.880 --> 36:45.112
CAREY: We didn't do a whole lot of talking
the night before we got on the plane.

36:46.120 --> 36:49.908
Not uncomfortable, just silence,
and it was almost like a peaceful silence.

36:53.600 --> 36:59.072
You know, I could hear him breathing
and I just felt pretty peaceful.

37:06.080 --> 37:09.436
I'd been thinking about running away
even before I met her.

37:16.200 --> 37:21.115
All I got to do was take a taxi cab
and, going to a train station,

37:21.160 --> 37:22.991
buy myself a ticket out of Spain.

37:24.440 --> 37:26.476
I could have done that
in a couple of minutes.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.675
Nothing was stopping me, nothing.

37:29.720 --> 37:32.280
I went down a few times in the hallway,

37:32.320 --> 37:36.552
always wondering if I was doing
the right thing, the wrong thing.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.673
Should I go, shouldn't I go,
should I go, shouldn't I go?

37:45.640 --> 37:47.631
(Distant shouting)

37:51.480 --> 37:56.395
When I was born,
I don't think there was much love.

37:58.840 --> 38:03.709
My mother was very, very young at the time
and she was, she was only 17 years old,

38:03.760 --> 38:08.629
met er...older man, which was my father,
from Algeria.

38:11.040 --> 38:14.396
My grandfather was a very racist person

38:14.440 --> 38:18.877
and knowing that the man my mother
spent the night with is an Algerian,

38:18.920 --> 38:22.356
he wanted absolutely my mother
to have an abortion.

38:22.400 --> 38:25.437
Er, to get rid of me
even before I was born.

38:27.680 --> 38:31.355
For him an Arab should be
dealt with a nuclear weapon

38:31.400 --> 38:33.391
and a black man is a monkey.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.717
Before I was born,
I definitely I had the wrong identity.

38:37.960 --> 38:43.512
Er, I already didn't know...I was already
prepared not to know who I really was.

38:46.880 --> 38:51.271
A new identity with a real passport,
an American passport.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.436
I could go to the US, go to school there.

38:54.120 --> 38:57.556
Live with that family
and just being someone.

38:57.600 --> 39:02.151
And don't have never again
to worry about being identified.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.231
I saw the opportunity.

39:07.240 --> 39:13.475
A woman that could go through so much
to get me with her back in a family

39:13.520 --> 39:17.513
which got kids, which seem a fam...
a loving family,

39:18.200 --> 39:20.077
gotta be some...somebody good,

39:21.200 --> 39:24.510
You know, I had conflicting rules
inside my own head.

39:50.720 --> 39:53.712
Carey want me to be Nicholas
but what about the others?

39:53.760 --> 39:55.716
Are they going to want me
to be Nicholas too?

39:57.760 --> 40:04.438
I didn't understand why he was so...
like, nervous, you know what I mean?

40:04.480 --> 40:07.836
He was like, you know,
constantly moving and to the bathroom,

40:07.920 --> 40:09.353
and watching people,

40:09.400 --> 40:11.630
watching me,
he was always watching me.

40:11.880 --> 40:13.871
She was always looking at me.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.434
I attested it to him just being scared.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.431
You know, he's going back home

40:20.080 --> 40:22.469
and we don't know what's happened to him,

40:22.520 --> 40:24.351
how his mind's working.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.595
Um, but he was just...
maybe he was afraid

40:26.640 --> 40:30.599
that, that he wouldn't be recognised
or, or Mom wouldn't love him any more.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.717
I'm gonna get killed.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.398
And I want...

40:35.440 --> 40:38.079
And I say,
well, maybe the plane better crash.

40:38.120 --> 40:43.353
When they said it was time for us
to board, I...nudged Nick and I said,

40:43.440 --> 40:46.318
"You ready? You ready to go home?"
He said, "I'm ready to go home."

40:46.360 --> 40:49.432
"Let's get the fuck out of here, and go home."

40:49.800 --> 40:51.791
(Laughs) And we got on the plane.

41:10.920 --> 41:16.552
I was really nervous,
anticipation, pretty happy.

41:17.640 --> 41:20.996
You know, we had made it...
It was a family thing, we all went together.

41:26.200 --> 41:28.714
MAN:
I remember that night, minute by minute.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.591
It was me, my grandma,

41:31.640 --> 41:33.915
my sister and my dad, I believe.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.996
We all loaded up in my Lincoln

41:36.040 --> 41:37.632
to go get my mom and Nicholas.

41:41.160 --> 41:44.630
It was a wait and see
but everybody was excited, you know.

41:44.680 --> 41:46.671
We didn't know what to expect...

41:57.760 --> 41:59.751
I didn't want to go out of the plane.

42:00.720 --> 42:01.994
I wanted to wait.

42:02.040 --> 42:03.439
I wanted to prepare myself.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.794
I didn't have no plan.
I didn't have no strategy.

42:19.240 --> 42:21.231
I knew there was no way out.

42:21.880 --> 42:23.677
I could not turn back.

42:32.120 --> 42:37.831
We had no idea what kind of person
we were getting, who was coming back.

43:00.720 --> 43:03.234
I wanted to run and grab and hold him
but he held back.

43:03.400 --> 43:08.155
So I walked down and grabbed his hand
and hugged him and told him I missed him.

43:20.400 --> 43:21.913
He had changed so much.

43:22.480 --> 43:24.436
It was like mind-boggling.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.713
But then I realised, you know,

43:26.760 --> 43:29.957
you tell yourself, well, he's been
through all this horrendous stuff,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.992
so he's absolutely gonna be different.

43:35.160 --> 43:39.711
CAREY: I just remember my kids
and my mom and erm, my husband

43:39.760 --> 43:41.716
and just, God, we were so happy.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.989
BEVERLY:
He was like totally covered up,

43:48.040 --> 43:52.795
so then I got scared, thinking
that this kid's really messed up,

43:54.640 --> 43:56.631
just by his appearance.

44:02.840 --> 44:08.710
He was very quiet and erm, standoffish.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.991
I never liked people to touch me.

44:16.920 --> 44:18.911
And I can't change that.

44:18.960 --> 44:21.599
So when she put her hands around me,

44:21.640 --> 44:25.474
she must have felt
that I wasn't enjoying it at all.

44:30.280 --> 44:34.273
I was very cold, very closed.
I didn't speak to people.

44:36.200 --> 44:42.230
As much as I was happy...I didn't show it.

44:50.080 --> 44:53.516
I had a border in front of me.

44:53.560 --> 44:55.198
I didn't want to screw up.

45:00.960 --> 45:08.878
Of course, it was welcome with open arms
and let's get you home attitude.

45:10.400 --> 45:13.597
Talk about the rest later, you know,
let's just go home.

45:30.240 --> 45:32.959
BEVERLY: I just watched him
all the way home in the car

45:33.040 --> 45:34.871
and you could tell he was uneasy.

45:35.560 --> 45:40.156

when you open your eyes is official,

47:35.280 --> 47:37.316
your name is Nicholas Patrick Barclay,

that you're born December 31st 1980,

47:40.280 --> 47:42.794

is calling me Nicholas

47:42.840 --> 47:45.638
and not "Nicholas,
but what is your real name?"

47:45.680 --> 47:47.671
No! Nicholas.

47:47.720 --> 47:50.154
"OK, we're going to go shopping, Nicholas."

47:56.560 --> 47:58.551
They drove me around,

47:58.920 --> 48:01.878
and, you know,
I knew I had to recognise something,

48:01.920 --> 48:06.198
so...and I also knew that I couldn't
because I'd never been there before.

48:07.400 --> 48:09.118
Hey, Kirk, how are you doin'?

48:09.160 --> 48:12.436
We met some people that knew Nicholas
before he disappeared.

48:12.480 --> 48:16.678
I told them I didn't remember them, there
was something but I didn't remember them.

48:16.720 --> 48:19.757
Like I had lost my memory,
which is what I told them.

48:21.600 --> 48:23.591
He's traumatised.

48:23.960 --> 48:25.871
That's why he wasn't remembering anything,

48:25.920 --> 48:29.390
because of all, all of the things
that had happened to him.

48:31.560 --> 48:33.073
I remember a sign.

48:33.120 --> 48:38.319
I saw Nicholas in the picture doing this
with his fingers, you know,

48:38.360 --> 48:40.351
his, his way to say "hello", you know,

48:40.760 --> 48:42.751
and I did it a few times with them.

48:43.040 --> 48:46.077
When I was there. That was one of
the only things I knew what to do.

48:48.280 --> 48:49.918
I was thinking to myself

48:49.960 --> 48:53.157
that Nicholas Barclay could come back
at his house any day.

48:53.840 --> 48:55.398
That was my first worry.

48:55.440 --> 48:57.431
I was really worried about that.

48:58.320 --> 49:01.153
I couldn't help it.
I said, "Man, what if he show up?"

49:01.480 --> 49:03.755
What if you opened the door
and say, "Hey, I'm back."

49:03.800 --> 49:05.279
(Laughs) You know.

49:07.200 --> 49:11.796
We thought the best thing for him
was just to have a normal routine.

49:12.560 --> 49:15.552
You get up, you eat breakfast,
you do this, you eat lunch,

49:15.600 --> 49:19.639
you eat dinner, we'd watch a movie,
just the normal family atmosphere.

49:19.880 --> 49:21.871
Me and him hung out.

49:22.600 --> 49:26.309

49:39.600 --> 49:42.910

49:43.440 --> 49:44.998
They would hang out, talk on the phone

was, erm, Jason, his other brother,

And finally he came to see me.

50:00.440 --> 50:05.912
He didn't look at me like Nicholas and he
didn't pretend to look at me like Nicholas

was to get his account of his kidnapping

51:10.720 --> 51:13.393
Not that people
can't change in three years,

51:13.440 --> 51:16.637
but this person in general
did not appear to be 16.

51:17.560 --> 51:20.836
He had a shadow of a beard,
a dark beard,

51:21.080 --> 51:26.200
that I doubt if Nicholas would have had
a shadow of a dark beard at the age of 16

51:26.240 --> 51:27.992
since he had blond hair.

51:28.040 --> 51:30.076
He appeared to be quite nervous

51:30.120 --> 51:34.113
and he just seemed very uncomfortable
this entire time.

51:39.160 --> 51:44.439
I told them that, um,
I was taken by military overseas

51:44.480 --> 51:46.710
and I was abducted and put in a van,

51:46.760 --> 51:50.196
then fly over to some places
that I never knew where it was.

51:50.920 --> 51:55.596
That, er, we were kept in a room
with different kids.

51:55.640 --> 51:56.789
They'd get chloroformed,

51:56.840 --> 52:00.071
and, er, they wake up and they're, er...

52:00.120 --> 52:03.749
you know, in a place
they don't know where they're at.

52:04.200 --> 52:11.276
They were subjected by
high-ranking military to sexual abuse.

52:11.680 --> 52:14.558
Every night all of the kids were raped
and molested by men.

52:14.920 --> 52:17.434
These men were American,
Mexican and European.

52:17.480 --> 52:22.918
They broke my hands, especially
my right hand, with a baseball bat.

52:22.960 --> 52:25.679
They kept burning him
and giving him insects to eat.

52:25.720 --> 52:27.836
- We were tortured.
- They broke his fingers.

52:27.880 --> 52:30.633
- His left foot was broken with a crowbar.
- I was raped.

52:30.680 --> 52:36.118
They keep these kids in line
by doing military scare tactics.

52:36.160 --> 52:37.479
We were experimented on.

52:37.520 --> 52:39.670
They would put needles in his eyes.

52:39.720 --> 52:44.840
Headphones on their heads screaming
and yelling, er, different languages.

52:44.880 --> 52:48.873
Spanish kept playing over and over
and a voice kept saying, "You are not you."

52:48.920 --> 52:50.876
If he spoke English, he was beaten.

52:50.920 --> 52:54.993
They moved these kids around
in military planes.

52:55.040 --> 52:56.996
We never saw where we were going.

52:57.040 --> 53:00.510
The boys' identities were changed
by either changing their hair colour,

53:00.560 --> 53:02.755
eye colour or other ways.

53:02.800 --> 53:04.153
They were always in uniform.

53:04.200 --> 53:05.872
A solution was put in his eyes.

53:05.920 --> 53:07.831
They would sell him for money for sex.

53:07.880 --> 53:11.555
His eye colour was changed from blue
to brown by the use of this solution.

53:11.600 --> 53:14.433
The door wasn't shut and I left by that door.

53:14.480 --> 53:17.438
I ran in the big hallway
and there was another door.

53:18.320 --> 53:20.231
Somehow I managed to go outside

53:20.280 --> 53:22.555
and outside I ran, I ran, I ran

53:22.600 --> 53:26.513
and hours after that
l, I discovered that I was in Spain.

53:44.760 --> 53:46.751
(Ringing tone)

53:57.200 --> 54:00.590
We've got a kid here
which is about 14, 15 years old.

54:00.640 --> 54:01.959
He doesn't have no ID.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.833
He's no documents on him
but you can see he's very young.

54:04.880 --> 54:06.791
And he's very scared.

54:10.840 --> 54:15.118
She was professional
but you could see that she was horrified.

54:15.760 --> 54:20.038
This was a horrendous interview
and when I left I was shaken by it

54:20.080 --> 54:23.868
because it had all the horrific,
emotional side effects

54:23.920 --> 54:26.309
that go with listening to such a story.

54:26.360 --> 54:29.830
He knew about this type of activity.

54:29.880 --> 54:33.111
I mean, a normal person
doesn't sit down with a story

54:33.160 --> 54:35.151
and make up horrendous...

54:35.680 --> 54:37.238
that's not what you lie about.

54:37.280 --> 54:41.876
You don't go into detail about torture
and the murdering of children or whatever.

54:41.920 --> 54:43.148
None of that seemed normal.

54:43.200 --> 54:44.872
He was tortured.

54:44.920 --> 54:46.638
I mean, he had torture written all...

54:46.680 --> 54:50.958
He had a broken hand
that was never medically attended to,

54:51.000 --> 54:52.592
he walked with a limp,

54:52.640 --> 54:58.510
erm, he had cigarette burns down the back
of his head to the back of his ankles.

54:58.560 --> 55:03.554
This person is either, erm,
had been the victim himself

55:03.640 --> 55:07.110
or he was a fantastic actor

55:07.160 --> 55:10.072
and I didn't
know which of those titles applied to him.

55:11.560 --> 55:14.438
I let them know that I was very sorry
about what had happened

55:14.480 --> 55:16.914
and we were going to locate
the people who had done this

55:16.960 --> 55:19.793
and put an end to the trauma
that he had been through.

55:24.200 --> 55:26.555
This was the last border.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.594
It's like you...

55:29.640 --> 55:31.995
I won. You know, the game is over.

55:33.400 --> 55:36.949
I had passports, everybody in the family
say I am Nicholas Barclay.

55:37.480 --> 55:39.471
Nobody was investigating me.

55:40.720 --> 55:43.359
Nobody was suspicious that I know.

55:46.600 --> 55:48.875
Hell, I was happy.

55:48.920 --> 55:51.434
I was, you know...
I couldn't believe my luck.

55:57.680 --> 56:00.638
My name is Charlie Parker.
I'm a private investigator.

56:00.680 --> 56:02.716
Hey, how are you doin'?

56:02.760 --> 56:05.228
Say, I want you...
I want you to do something for me.

56:10.400 --> 56:14.473

56:14.520 --> 56:18.195
♪ Yet beautiful fields lie just before me...

56:18.240 --> 56:24.679
I got a call back in November and, erm,
from a television producer for Hard Copy

56:24.720 --> 56:26.711
and he said that a boy

56:26.760 --> 56:30.639
who had been missing earlier for four years
had turned up

56:30.680 --> 56:34.434
and he wanted me to track him down
so they could get an interview with him.

56:36.120 --> 56:39.510
First I had to find out where his mother lived.

56:39.560 --> 56:45.112
Found her and then we drove out to
the north of San Antonio to do the interview.

56:51.480 --> 56:55.758
I had repeatedly asked him,
please do not contact the media.

56:55.800 --> 56:58.712
If anything that Nicholas was telling us was true,

56:58.760 --> 57:00.796
if any of it had any accuracy,

57:00.840 --> 57:03.798
and if there was any military officer
possibly involved,

57:03.840 --> 57:06.308
the last thing that we wanted it to be put

57:06.360 --> 57:08.920
was on the front page of the newspaper
or on television

57:08.960 --> 57:12.589
so that that abductor would know
something about our investigation.

57:14.880 --> 57:17.075
This is Eyewitness News at 10.

57:17.640 --> 57:20.234
He disappeared without a trace three years ago.

57:20.280 --> 57:22.635
Tonight a San Antonio boy is back home.

57:22.680 --> 57:25.274
Nicholas Barclay is now 16 years old.

57:25.320 --> 57:26.833
He vanished when he was 13...

57:26.880 --> 57:28.279
Nicholas says he was kidnapped

57:28.320 --> 57:29.469
and taken to Spain.

57:29.560 --> 57:32.916
He says for three years he was repeatedly
drugged, beaten and raped,

57:32.960 --> 57:36.714
all part of a sex slave operation
involving dozens of missing children.

57:36.760 --> 57:39.479
Well, Bob, the FBI is not taking this case lightly...

57:39.520 --> 57:40.555
The reason?

57:40.600 --> 57:43.160
Somehow a 13-year-old boy from San Antonio

57:43.200 --> 57:46.112
ended up in Spain without a passport.

57:46.160 --> 57:49.914
June 19th 1994,
Nicholas got into a fight with his family,

57:49.960 --> 57:52.793
so he came here to Fort Sam Houston
to play basketball.

57:52.840 --> 57:55.229
Two young boys approached him,
they started talking.

57:55.280 --> 57:59.159
The next thing he knew, there was a cloth
over his mouth and Nicholas passed out.

58:00.320 --> 58:02.276
He claims his captors
changed his appearance

58:02.320 --> 58:04.038
to make him unrecognisable.

58:04.120 --> 58:06.315
He was no longer allowed to speak English.

58:06.360 --> 58:08.351
Did they rape you all every night?

58:09.160 --> 58:10.479
Me? No.

58:10.520 --> 58:13.956
Because they didn't rape me every night.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.070
Some of them, they liked more.

58:16.120 --> 58:17.599
Some of the kids they liked more.

58:17.640 --> 58:21.679
They rape them
usually two or three times a week.

58:21.880 --> 58:26.670
I wanted the media's attention, so that
I would make Nicholas even more real,

58:26.720 --> 58:30.110
that people would really believe
that I'm Nicholas

58:30.760 --> 58:33.593
and they would love me even more for that.

58:35.200 --> 58:38.988
They set him up, put a microphone on him
and had the cameras on him

58:39.040 --> 58:41.793
and I moved over behind a booth.

58:41.840 --> 58:43.831
And it was almost fate.

58:44.200 --> 58:46.873
Behind that booth was a picture

58:46.920 --> 58:48.911
of the actual Nicholas Barclay.

58:49.600 --> 58:53.559
And I could look at that picture
and look at him at the same time.

58:53.840 --> 58:58.630
And as I looked at the picture, I noticed
that the boy had blue-grey-looking eyes

58:58.680 --> 59:00.591
and this man had brown eyes.

59:02.680 --> 59:05.558
Here was a moment where the hair
stood up on the back of your neck,

59:05.600 --> 59:08.512
and, and er...there was
just something wrong about it.

59:08.960 --> 59:10.996
I did what they wanted me to do.

59:11.040 --> 59:14.316
Something was wrong. I said,
"Can you get me a picture of his ears?"

59:14.360 --> 59:15.998
I need to get...get that.

59:16.040 --> 59:22.912
And I had read about Scotland Yard
using that method to trace down a man,

59:23.360 --> 59:26.272
James Earl Ray,
that had killed Martin Luther King.

59:26.320 --> 59:29.596
They had caught him in Heathrow Airport
by identifying his ears.

59:29.640 --> 59:35.909
And I knew the ears were a means of identity,
almost like fingerprints.

59:37.880 --> 59:40.235
I put the picture in my pocket and took it...

59:42.040 --> 59:43.359
When I got back to the office,

59:43.400 --> 59:45.709
I put the pictures in Adobe Photoshop.

59:54.440 --> 59:56.078
They, they were different ears.

59:56.120 --> 59:57.712
And so I knew right away

59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.116
that absolutely he was not Nicholas Barclay.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.475
I thought I had a spy.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:07.034
I thought I had real, honest to God spy.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:12.116
Why else would a guy come here
and take the place of another person?

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.479
What would be his reason?

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.791
I phoned Nancy Fisher.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.353
I said, "This guy's a fake. It's not him."

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.992
I said, "The ears don't match."

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.519
And my comment to him was,

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.548
"You need to be very careful

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.034
that you don't intrude
on the federal investigation."

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.551
People aren't used to hearing
you talk about somebody's ears

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.956
and I think she was taken back by that.
She didn't know what I was talking about.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.514
I thought I didn't have a right to question,

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.279
you know, their statement
that this was their family member

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.153
because how, how could they be wrong?

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.794
I mean, no-one would be wrong
about something like that.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.276
What do they want? I've already got
the fact he doesn't have the same ears.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.871
Why would you ever,
ever take in a stranger?

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.831
Not just a stranger from this country

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.236
but a stranger from another country
who speaks with a French accent.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.350
This has to be Nicholas Barclay.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.949
It was an outrageous thing.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.798
I cannot have talked to anyone

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:17.039

Well, he started back to high school.

I really was worried.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.874
I didn't know what he was going to do.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.434
This was a case. I mean, a real case.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.158
This guy was lying
about who he said he was

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.191
and here the family was accepting him.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:06.233
I expected him any day to blow up
something at the airbase

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.635
or do something at the army base.

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:15.315
I was pulling teeth trying to determine
who had kidnapped Nicholas,

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.590
when and where
and under what circumstances.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.237
I had almost no information

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.397
because all the information he gave us
was very, very general.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.795
He couldn't give names,
he couldn't give places,

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.115
he couldn't give times,
he couldn't give anything.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.878
The family was told that the reason
we were taking Nicholas to Houston

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.751
was because he'd been through trauma.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.998
So he deserved to see a forensic expert
to deal with the trauma.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.713
Initially I thought that this was
going to be a forensic interview,

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:52.639
er, with the intent of finding out
more information

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.557
about the people who abducted him.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:04.433
Here was this pale white kid
and I introduced myself

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:08.632
and, as he spoke back, immediately my...

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.830
Something in me just said,
this is not right,

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.393
there's something wrong here.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.590
I speak with him for a long time.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:18.349
He asked me to repeat all the stories
I'd been telling everybody.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.631
I remember people grabbing me
and putting me in the van.

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:26.117
I went to sleep and I woke up in a room.
There was other kids...

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.232
I didn't see the same physiological change

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:35.958
in his body posture,
in his pupil size, in his heart rate,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.399
that I would normally see

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.432
with somebody who's talking about
a traumatic experience.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:49.519
He couldn't speak English
without an accent.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:54.315
That told me about the development of his brain,
and the development of language.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:01.559
You just cannot be raised for
the first six, seven years of your life

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:05.798
in an English-speaking home

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:10.231
and later on, you know,
eight, nine years later,

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:13.113
even 10 years later,

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.720
not be able to speak English
without an accent.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:23.154
I can guarantee you that this kid was
not raised in an English-speaking family.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.076
You know, I don't know who he is
but the person who was...I was interviewing

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.156
could not have been Nicholas Barclay.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.915
OK, the worst scenario
just showed up and I don't like that.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.509
This investigation did a 90 degree.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:43.030
It just went from one, one place
all the way up to another.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.353
I immediately called Carey Gibson
and I said to her,

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.359
"Carey, Dr Perry has just stated
that this person cannot be your brother,

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.789
for the fact
that he cannot be an American.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.680
This could be a very dangerous person."

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:03.150
She shrieked or screamed
and said, "Oh, my gosh!"

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.595
So I said, "Don't be at the airport," you know.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:10.359
"I'll handle it. I will take care of this individual"

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.709
and that she did not have to take him home,

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.796
you know, back to her home to live with them

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.149
and she says, "OK, OK."

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:27.995
We fly back into San Antonio
and there's Carey standing there.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.395
What?

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:37.273
She acted like we'd
never had that conversation.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:41.393
And she acted excited to see him,
asked him how his trip was.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.310
I think I just stared for a minute...

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:48.791
And I called the US Attorneys' Office
right then and there

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.751
and I said, "What do I do?"

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:56.795
And the Assistant US Attorney said,
"Let him return to her temporarily."

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.391
She welcomed this person home
just like he was her brother.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:05.228
I didn't have any clue
as to why she behaved in this manner.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.795
Because in my conversation with her,

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.479
I had said,
"This person is not your brother."

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:15.274
I don't think... I don't remember her
putting it in those words.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.630
Well, maybe they wanted him so badly
to be their son

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.398
that they said he was their son,

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.034
but it was starting to get ridiculous.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.589
I couldn't let it go. There was no way
in the world I could let it go.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.509
I started going into the neighbourhood,

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.551
and finding out about
the real Nicholas Barclay,

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.238
interviewing the neighbours,

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:41.511
trying to find out
what I could about that boy

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.232
and about that family.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.032
And what's going on?

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.196
You know, why would Nicholas have left?

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.118
The police used to usually come

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:54.472
maybe like twice or three times a month.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.432
Either it was argument with the kids

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.677
or with their boyfriend or with the other son.

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:07.319
I spoke to everyone and they all said
that Nicholas had caused trouble,

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.078
had come home late at night.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:11.350
We've all had arguments in our family,

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.197
but it's rare that we call the police,

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.276
that it is so bad that they have to come.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.752
It, it made me think
there was something going on,

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.916
more than meets the eye. Of course it did.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.755
I knew that DNA samples would prove
that he wasn't Nicholas Barclay.

01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:36.755
Mrs Dollarhide said, "This is my son.

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.872
I don't have to provide blood samples
for you for DNA

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.478
and she laid down on the floor,

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.511
literally laid down on the floor,

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.832
and said, "No, and you can't pick me up,
and you can't make me."

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:52.314
I did not want to go anywhere with the FBI,
but I don't remember refusing.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.154
I was stunned.
I've never had that reaction before.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.589
She wasn't just apathetic,
she was hostile.

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:03.836
To be honest with you, I really have
no idea what I was thinking at that time.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:08.395
My main goal in life was not, not to think.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.478
We didn't need to prove who he was.
We knew who he was.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:21.399
I no longer saw them as a grieving erm...
victimised family.

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:24.318
I saw them as a very questionable family.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:29.435
There would be no reason for them
to accept a stranger into their lives...

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.035
..unless there was something to hide.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.832
That would be the only reason.

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.837
Something was being hidden
and I didn't know what that was.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.635
When Beverly refused
to give her blood sample,

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.638
I started to become suspicious.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.513
They knew that I wasn't Nicholas.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.316
Whatever I was telling them,

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.277
they didn't believe a word of it.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.038
But they were good at not showing it.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:12.033
I mean, who wouldn't see it?

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:17.118
That's about four, five years ago now.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.556
I remember in Spain,
Carey did everything for me.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.671
When I didn't know something, she told me.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.479
"You forgot everything
but you're going to remember it now

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:33.469
and, you know, this was Mom at the place
we're living in with... Do you remember?

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:37.752
Oh, this was Chantelle. You remember
Chantelle. That's your niece, my daughter.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.997
Do you remember that? Do you
remember that? Do you remember that?"

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.871
Over and over and over again.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.069
That's Jason.

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.759
She wanted to put it in my head.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.553
She wanted to put it in my head
so I would never forget.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:53.558
She just could not say it's not Nicholas.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.431
Did she believe it or not?

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.754
If you asked me, I would say,

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.360
no, not for a second
did she believe I was her brother.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.550
She decided I was gonna be her brother.

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.470
It's like I woke up in a place where...

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:10.270
Lies even bigger than what I did.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.833
You know, it's...

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:17.350
they pretended as much as I did
and even more.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.431
I kept thinking about the kid,
Nicholas Barclay.

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:39.833
At the time of his disappearance,

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.236
he was living with Beverly
in the house on Swallow Street

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.192
and his brother Jason
was also living there.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.514
Jason, Nick's older brother,

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.198
when he moved into their house,

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.434
that house changed,

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.799
because before he got there,

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.034
Nick and his mom

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.752
seemed pretty close to me.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.598
She loved him to death.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:08.236
I mean, she loved him, you could tell...
She, she... He was the light of her life.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.510
This guy moved in,
he was a bum, a drug addict

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.079
and he only cared about himself.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.709
And when he got into that house,
it just made things that much more worse.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.753
In fact, I think it even pushed his mom
into doing drugs herself

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.358
when he moved into the house.

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.392
That house just became
a volatile situation altogether.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.638
I discovered from the police files,

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.148
a couple of months
after the disappearance,

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.995
that Jason had called the police

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:40.635
and said that his brother
had tried to break into the house.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.915
Well, we see that kind of thing all the time.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:49.077
People, people
are constantly doing stuff like that

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:52.237
to make people think that person's alive.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.113
I started to put two and two together

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.993
and I thought something happened
inside that house to that boy.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.512
I didn't need to be Columbo
to put all the pieces together.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.671
They killed him.

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:19.154
Some of them did it, some of them knew of it,
and some of them chose to ignore it.

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:28.279
I wasn't worried about
Nicholas coming back no more.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.551
Neither Nicholas Barclay
or his mother were cooperating,

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.797
so we were going to have to have
a search warrant executed

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.400
in order to obtain those blood samples.

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:47.671
I couldn't pretend no more to be Nicholas
and act like Nicholas.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.190
I took two or three other agents with me
to go pick him up.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:59.710
So inside me, I started getting,
you know, more and more aggressive,

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.508
weird.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.558
I couldn't go on.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.118
We got the fingerprints
and we got the palm prints.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.869
Within a few weeks, we would be sending
them out to Interpol, to the embassies,

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.797
to see if any of these fingerprints

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.593
matched anything that they had on record.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.358
I was trying to find a way out,

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:20.318
not only a way out in San Antonio, Texas,

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.476
but a way out, out of my mind.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.231
Nicholas was becoming
much more agitated and angry

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.999
and I really felt like
he was going to run away

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:32.032
and if he ran away we might have
a very hard time locating him.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.400
I started tailing him,
I started following him.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.830
I started sitting up on Beverly's place
where she lived

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.873
and writing down licence numbers of
all the cars that came to her, to see her.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:48.633
So I took a razor blade
and I slit my face.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:51.717
Everything was snowballing
and snowballing and snowballing.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.275
I show them, show them that

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.754
I was under a great deal of pressure.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.756
On March 3rd of 1998,

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:03.395
the legate in Madrid, Spain, called me

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.113
and he said, "We've just identified him."

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.593
And I said, "You're kidding?"

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:12.555
I knew that everything was going down
and it was just a matter of weeks.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:17.355
He said, "What I'm gonna do right now
is fax to you the records that I have."

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.872
CHARLIE: He agreed to meet with me.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.717
We ordered hot cakes.

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:25.355
And we started to eat.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:27.231
And he said...

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.555
I said,
"You really made your mother angry."

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:32.592
And he said,
"She's not my mother and you know it."

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.272
And I thought, well, I'II be damned.

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:37.790
And so I stood over the fax machine,

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.914
waiting for, of course, them to come in

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.110
because I was screaming
and jumping up and down.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.111
I actually said, "Well, I'll be damned,

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.549
you're going to finally tell me
who you are."

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:56.793
I was like doing a dance
and everybody was high-fiving.

01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:00.196
It was like, you know, we finally,
we finally know who this person is.

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.518
And my heart was beating fast,
just like it is now thinking about it.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:09.836
And... And I said, "Who are you?"

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:12.917
He said, "I'm Frederic Bourdin
and I'm wanted by Interpol."

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.478
The fingerprint cards told me

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.717
that he was not 16, he was 23.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.629
That he was not American, he was French.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:26.758
That he was not Nicholas Barclay,
he was Frederic Bourdin.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.273
We grow up in America thinking Interpol

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.756
is kind of the God of the cops.
You follow me?

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.268
That's the highest step you can get
in "Copland".

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.436
And so I thought, Jesus Christ,

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:41.711
if he's wanted by Interpol,
what has he done? You know.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.671
There is no limit to what he's done.

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:45.199
So he began to tell me.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.556
NANCY: Frederic Bourdin is delinquent.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:52.591
Activities and modus operandi...

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.712
He has travelled throughout Europe

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.193
appearing at shelters for minors

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.639
under different aliases.

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:08.158
Spain, 1992.

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.790
Spain, September 1993.

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.311
(Overlapping voices)

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:16.709
Barcelona...

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:19.752
.. stated that he'd run away
from his adoptive parents' house.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.831
Brussels, '95.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.718
Pyrenees...

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.671
Milan, 1993.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.069
Glasgow.

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.918
I sat there. I could hardly eat,
I could hardly swallow my food.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.595
He always wore glasses.

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:41.710
Giovanni Petrullo.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.751
Michelangelo Martini.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.315
Donovan MacNeph.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.233
- Peter Samson.
- William Thomas.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.918
Jimmy Sale.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.632
Peter Robin.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.591
James Markey.

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.675
Frederic Cassis.

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:55.755
'93.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.108
Hernandez Fernandez.

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.189
'95.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.355
Edgar Guteyere.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.628
'97.

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.671
Spain, 1997.

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:07.235
It's possible he may need psychiatric help.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.114
Settle in tonight

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.037
because we are about to share with you

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:16.593
a story so bizarre,

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.631
it's hard to believe it's true.

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:21.114
This is the tale of a master imposter

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:24.391
who managed to lie his way
into the United States

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:27.671
and prey upon
the most vulnerable of people.

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.711
He is the only person in US history

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.150
ever to have assumed
the identity of a missing child.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:36.033
He fooled even the lost boy's mother.

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.674
It's hard to imagine
how he could have gotten away with it.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.508
We knew it was going to be,
you know, heart-wrenching and...

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:06.875
you know...

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.831
but we never thought it wouldn't be him.

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.915
You know, why would you even think that?

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.110
The first feeling was complete sadness.

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.709
Because it wasn't Nicholas.

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.671
Which took us back to square one.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.950
Where is Nicholas?

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.991
That was the first one.

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:27.193
The second emotion was,

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.599
how could I be so fucking stupid?

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.392
I mean, seriously.

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:41.749
I contacted the SAPD,
the San Antonio Police Department,

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:45.793
and told them, decided to tell them,
that, hey, they killed him.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.989
Based upon Frederic Bourdin's allegations,

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:56.196
a homicide investigation was opened

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:59.789
and the allegation
was against the family members

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:04.197
as being...participating in
the disappearance of the child.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:08.552
It was related to us
that while Frederic was in jail

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.194
that he said that my mom confessed to him

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:14.073
that her and Jason
killed Nicholas and hid the body.

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:17.679
They accused me first

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.991
and it totally freaked me out.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:28.754
Because I, I...have been crazy
but never violent.

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:35.357
This is the street the kid lived on
when he went missing.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.911
There's the house right there.

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.671
I think the boy's buried here.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:55.078
I want to talk to Darryl inside.

01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:01.275
He's agreed to let me dig
and see if Nicholas Barclay's here.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:06.073
If Beverly knew that this individual
was not her son,

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.839
then she had to have
some type of ulterior motive

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:12.714
and it had to be something very scary

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:16.309
for her to accept a stranger
into her household

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.759
posing as her own son.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.836
I agreed to take a lie detector test.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.991
She passed the polygraph.

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:26.992
And I said to the polygraph examiner,

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.632
"I don't understand this,

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:31.274
I don't understand it at all.
Will you give it to her again?"

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:41.236
So he gave it to her again
and she passed the polygraph.

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.192
I said, "No, there is something wrong."

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.511
The third time he gave it to her,

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:50.954
she flunked every question.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.319
I mean, like, big-time.

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:56.069
The polygrapher said the machine
practically jumped off the table.

01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:00.469
Her answers appeared to be
false on everything.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.558
And he turned to her and he said,

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:09.832
"Mrs Dollarhide, it appears
that you know where your son is.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:14.032
It appears that you know what happened
to him" and some other questions.

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:17.238
And that's when she became
very aggravated, very agitated,

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.032
jumped up and ran out and was screaming.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:26.313
I lied about being...stealing,

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.278
and I had...so that's why I failed.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.516
I didn't lie about anything
to do with Nicholas.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.391
It was the other questions.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.557
- Darryl? Charlie Parker.
- Mr Parker.

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.591
How are you doin'?

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.189
It's nice in here.

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:45.639
So this is the house, huh?

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.999
Yes, sir.

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:52.160
The polygraph led us to believe
that she did have some information...

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:58.159
..she could provide that she refused to
and we felt like Jason had information.

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:03.191
If Jason did something to Nicholas,
I didn't know about it

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:07.756
and I can't imagine Jason ever doing that.

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:10.075
It's just not in his makeup,

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.873
but...I don't know.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:23.433
I know my brother or my mother did not
kill Nicholas, accidentally, on purpose.

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:25.914
Whatever Frederic said, it never happened.

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:31.231
When we first got my dog, he was always
digging in the back corner over there

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.599
where the, the tree is.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:37.191
And one day I was mowing
and saw, like, pieces of, like, plastic,

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:39.549
- kind of like a tarp kind of material...
- OK.

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:42.353
..sticking out of the ground.
I tried to pull it up to get it out,

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:45.198
and it just kept ripping on me
as it was stuck in the ground.

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.708
So I never paid any attention to it
or gave it any thought,

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.069
until last night when we were speaking
on the phone.

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:53.196
And the bush has been there a while?

01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:00.039
I had initially tried to get a hold of
Jason prior to Frederic's arrest

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.274
and couldn't.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.118
And then when I finally did
get a hold of him,

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.720
I asked him
about the disappearance of his brother.

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:13.668
He just seemed totally apathetic about
the disappearance of his younger brother.

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.039
Extremely apathetic.

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:18.152
And didn't care that he'd been returned

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.474
but when he did see him,

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.078
no, that wasn't his brother,

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.873
but he didn't seem interested enough
or excited enough

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.798
to tell his mother and sister,
"That's not my brother.

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:29.354
No, no, they just wanted to believe."

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.514
Yeah, it's a good spot. Let's see.

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.551
Say he dumps him here first...

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.879
..and then, if he looks up,

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.113
yeah, yeah, this is good, this is good.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:46.869
He was very hostile,
refused to help in any way,

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.754
and then he later left
the drug rehabilitation centre

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:54.156
and was found having died
from a drug overdose.

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:58.269
I think that Jason became a perfect scapegoat
because he's not here.

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.954
He died,

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.835
so he can't be questioned
or, you know, anything.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:11.718
I mean,
he can't, he can't even defend himself.

01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:23.472
It's kinda like a nightmare.

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:28.709
AII this stuff is coming at you and none
of it's true but nobody believes you.

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:31.354
Or they think that you had
something to do with it.

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:37.110
And it's like getting in trouble
for something you didn't do.

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:43.394
You know, when kids tell you,
"I didn't do it!"

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.431
You're going, "Yeah, right."

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.591
But I didn't do it.

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:55.629
I do feel like the family knows
the whereabouts of Nicholas Barclay.

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:59.673
I think that Beverly Dollarhide
and Jason Dollarhide knew at one time

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:02.109
what happened to Nicholas Barclay.

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.798
Show me one piece of evidence,

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:07.355
show me one thing that will lock
anybody in our family up over this,

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:11.029
just one shred of actual proof.

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.196
Back here. Let's go back here.

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:20.991
The biggest,
funniest one to me, hilarious,

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:24.193
is that we went and picked up
a complete stranger

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:27.152
to hide the fact that we killed Nicholas

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.668
or someone in my family killed Nicholas.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:32.837
When through four years
that Nicholas was disappeared,

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:35.075
we were the only ones looking for him.

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:40.353
Why would we go pick up a stranger to hide
something that didn't need to be hidden?

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:51.671
Just another one of his lies.

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.599
REPORTER: Even from behind bars,

01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:59.871
he continued to lie to families
of other missing children.

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.392
From this phone in his cell,

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.351
Bourdin made hundreds of collect calls

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.312
claiming to have information
about lost children.

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:09.399
He even said he could help solve

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.034
the highly publicised case
of Sabrina Aisenberg,

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:15.675
an infant who was taken from her home
in Tampa, Florida, last year.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.271
No.

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:27.073
Yes.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.879
He's a habitual liar

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:35.592
and it blows my mind

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:41.351
that anybody can take anything
that is said out of his mouth as truth.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.235
What? This kid comes
and says he's Nicholas,

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:48.554
and then turns around and says,

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:51.433
"You...these people
that took care of me killed him."

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:54.040
