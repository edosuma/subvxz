I can't believe Han is making
us tidy up this damn diner.

00:06.176 --> 00:09.311
It's like putting
a pretty church hat on a whore.

00:11.915 --> 00:14.950
Come on, harder, faster!
Do it faster and harder.

00:20.357 --> 00:21.623
No time for jokes, Max.

00:21.624 --> 00:23.325
The health inspector
will be here soon,

00:23.326 --> 00:25.194
and I need to get
that "A" rating.

00:25.195 --> 00:27.629
This diner getting an "A"
for cleanliness

00:27.630 --> 00:31.266
would be like me getting an "A"
for a bra size.

00:31.267 --> 00:34.269
Oh, it will happen.
I did a thorough job.

00:42.012 --> 00:44.913
Is he making omelets
or crystal meth?

00:46.349 --> 00:49.385
Oleg, you let Han put you
in two hair nets?

00:49.386 --> 00:52.789
Three.
I don't want to talk about it.

01:10.491 --> 01:12.993
Sorry I'm late.
I was having my nails done.

01:12.994 --> 01:14.995
It's the first time
I stopped moving in two years,

01:14.996 --> 01:17.731
and I fell asleep.

01:17.732 --> 01:19.933
You had money to get
your nails done?

01:19.934 --> 01:22.035
Question: Was prostitution
as disgusting

01:22.036 --> 01:24.905
as you thought it would be?

01:24.906 --> 01:26.206
Han paid for it.

01:26.207 --> 01:28.675
Oh, so it was worse.

There's my show pony.

I want you to be the first thing
the health inspector sees

01:38.986 --> 01:39.986
when he enters.

01:39.987 --> 01:42.856
You're just so blonde
and clean.

01:44.826 --> 01:47.861
Hey! Where's my manicure?
How come I don't get anything?

01:47.862 --> 01:50.630
Oh, I haven't forgotten you.
Here's 50 bucks.

01:50.631 --> 01:52.899
Beat it until
the inspector leaves.

01:54.869 --> 01:59.239
Some would be insulted.
I'm gonna ask for $75.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.508
And, you are going to get it.

02:05.179 --> 02:07.380
I have exciting news.
At the nail salon,

02:07.381 --> 02:09.983
I heard about this amazing
seminar we should go to.

02:09.984 --> 02:12.319
[Laughs] Oh, no, no, no.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.187
I went to a seminar once.

02:14.188 --> 02:17.290
I was almost married
to 300 Koreans.

02:17.291 --> 02:20.060
It's a branding seminar
for business owners

02:20.061 --> 02:22.262
to define who they are
and get them primed and ready

02:22.263 --> 02:24.264
for their window
of opportunity.

02:24.265 --> 02:27.701
I think I'd rather be married
to 300 Koreans.

02:27.702 --> 02:30.570
Then I could get my nails done
whenever I wanted.

02:30.571 --> 02:32.139
Max, this is the real deal.

02:32.140 --> 02:34.241
The woman who runs it
is a branding genius.

02:34.242 --> 02:36.376
She created the Nike
"Just Do It."

02:36.377 --> 02:38.411
Oh, that woman
didn't make up "just do it."

02:38.412 --> 02:41.448
high school boyfriends have been
using that for centuries.

02:42.650 --> 02:43.717
You're still here!

02:43.718 --> 02:46.620
What's it gonna take,
another $10?

02:47.522 --> 02:48.855
Hey, I don't need a seminar.

02:48.856 --> 02:53.226
I found a brand that's gonna
get me rich--obnoxious!

02:53.227 --> 02:55.796
Okay, Earl, how is cleaning
your area coming along?

02:55.797 --> 02:58.431
I've got decades
of napkins over here

02:58.432 --> 03:00.534
with all my old ideas on them.

03:00.535 --> 03:03.804
Apparently,
napkins were the old Twitter.

03:06.140 --> 03:07.574
Hello.

03:07.575 --> 03:08.508
Could you tell the owner

03:08.509 --> 03:10.410
the health inspector
has arrived?

03:10.411 --> 03:12.245
Oh, you are a woman.

03:12.246 --> 03:14.447
Thank you for noticing.

03:16.350 --> 03:17.751
Are you Han Lee?

03:17.752 --> 03:19.953
Hey, Han, is this the--

03:23.024 --> 03:24.491
So where would you like
to start?

03:24.492 --> 03:26.927
Sadly, the men's room.

03:26.928 --> 03:29.496
Ground zero.

03:29.497 --> 03:31.464
I will join you
in a second.

03:31.465 --> 03:33.500
Is it Miss or Mrs. Rotello?

03:33.501 --> 03:36.703
It's Miss.
Thank you for asking.

03:37.638 --> 03:40.740
I'll see you at the toilets.

03:40.741 --> 03:43.743
Ground zero just got
a lot nicer.

03:46.547 --> 03:52.052
Han, I think that health
inspector wants to inspect you.

03:52.053 --> 03:54.788
Stop! If she hears you,
she'll give me an "F."

03:54.789 --> 03:57.524
I think she wants you
to give her an "F."

03:58.926 --> 04:01.795
Max, I paid you $90.
Now, go!

04:03.464 --> 04:04.998
- Here, Max.
- What's this?

04:04.999 --> 04:07.101
That's how we'll make
the $600 we need for the seminar.

04:07.102 --> 04:09.402
I made flyers for
a yard sale at Kinko's.

04:09.403 --> 04:13.006
Wow, Kinko's" and "yard sale"
in the same breath.

04:13.007 --> 04:16.142

this inner strength?

Hi, girls!

04:26.004 --> 04:28.072
Hey, Sophie!
Where's all your junk?

04:28.073 --> 04:32.093
Oh, where it always is--
In my trunk! [Laughs]

04:33.462 --> 04:35.496
Well, look here.

04:35.497 --> 04:37.298
I got a bunch of stuff
that Oleg wanted

04:37.299 --> 04:39.433
to donate to your yard sale.

04:39.434 --> 04:41.135
Aw, that's so nice of him.

04:41.136 --> 04:43.538
Oh, yeah,
he doesn't know about it.

04:43.539 --> 04:44.639
Yeah, it's all the stuff

04:44.640 --> 04:46.874
he's been leaving around
my apartment.

04:46.875 --> 04:49.343
He's getting way
too comfortable, so...

04:49.344 --> 04:53.114
Sell it all!
Yeah. [Laughs]

04:53.115 --> 04:56.384
You probably can get a couple
of bucks for his passport.

04:56.385 --> 04:58.786
Yeah, he paid $80 for it.

04:58.787 --> 05:00.454
Maybe he's leaving
things around

05:00.455 --> 05:02.790
because he wants to take things
to another level,

05:02.791 --> 05:04.325
maybe even move in.

05:04.326 --> 05:08.496
Oh, girl talk.
Ooh!

05:08.497 --> 05:12.667
Shouldn't you serve me a cosmo
like they do on television?

05:12.668 --> 05:15.169
Don't have any cosmos,
as we're broke

05:15.170 --> 05:18.272
and it's not 1998, but...

05:18.273 --> 05:19.607
How about a pink cupcake?

05:19.608 --> 05:21.542
Oh, even better.

05:21.543 --> 05:23.845
Maybe now that Oleg
has told you he loves you,

05:23.846 --> 05:27.148
you're starting to have intimacy
issues about getting close.

05:27.149 --> 05:29.150
Oh, come on.

05:29.151 --> 05:32.420
Save that garbage
for your yard sale.

05:32.421 --> 05:35.656
Yeah, the man is just
up there too much.

05:35.657 --> 05:39.794
I mean, he's down there when
he's up there, but, yeah...

05:39.795 --> 05:42.163
It's way too much, yeah.

05:42.164 --> 05:44.098
He's got to change,
or he's out.

05:44.599 --> 05:47.168
Hey, thanks
for the cupcake, Max.

05:47.169 --> 05:49.136
And, Caroline...

05:49.137 --> 05:51.439
I don't know what you add,
but, yeah.

05:54.443 --> 05:56.377
Our yard sale is not quite
all set up yet.

05:56.378 --> 05:58.346
You're early.
Our flyer said 1:00 to 5:00.

05:58.347 --> 06:01.015
Oh, I don't do flyers.

06:01.016 --> 06:03.150
Miss Trudy, my card.

06:03.151 --> 06:07.788
This is my wife, Miss Trudy,
and the bird's name is Scott.

06:09.458 --> 06:12.860

crazy kitsch genius.

06:13.896 --> 06:16.230
"Lord of The Things."

06:18.400 --> 06:21.269

of classic couture pieces.

06:21.270 --> 06:22.637

06:22.638 --> 06:26.307
Well, I have been before.
Miss Trudy?

06:26.308 --> 06:28.876
[Scoffs] We went all the way
to Pennsylvania for

06:28.877 --> 06:30.811
a <i>Facts of Life</i> bean bag
toss game.

06:30.812 --> 06:32.947
- No Blair!
- [Whispering] No Blair.

06:32.948 --> 06:35.149
Just two tooties.

06:36.184 --> 06:38.519

it hard sometimes.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.454
Am I right, Scott?

06:40.455 --> 06:41.856
So, on that chair
are my things,

06:41.857 --> 06:43.024
and you'll notice
that there's a lot--

06:43.025 --> 06:45.726
Oh, I already did.
14 for all of it.

06:45.727 --> 06:47.295
$1,400, perfect!

06:47.296 --> 06:50.698

Darling, $14.

06:51.767 --> 06:53.434
But this is all vintage.

06:53.435 --> 06:56.070
Vintage, or just
out of season?

06:57.039 --> 06:59.073
Wait, is that a Nugget Buddy?

06:59.074 --> 07:00.775
Miss Trudy,
they have the cowboy.

07:00.776 --> 07:02.109
He loves the cowboy.

07:02.110 --> 07:05.246
I bet he does.

07:05.247 --> 07:06.914
Oh, I am so relieved.

07:06.915 --> 07:09.684
When we don't find anything
good, he gets really mad...

07:09.685 --> 07:11.719
[Whispers] At me.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.621
I'm sorry, that's not supposed
to be out.

07:13.622 --> 07:14.922
I can't break up the set.

07:14.923 --> 07:17.024
You have all ten
Nugget Buddies?

07:17.025 --> 07:20.361
Yep, and every other
Happy Meal toy since 1993.

07:20.362 --> 07:21.996
My mom used to take me there
a lot.

07:21.997 --> 07:25.800
[Laughs] Well, she used to leave
me there a lot, but same diff.

07:25.801 --> 07:27.535
$600 for the whole collection.

07:27.536 --> 07:29.570
- Sold!
- Whoa, whoa, not sold.

all over again.

07:37.713 --> 07:39.046
And you--

07:39.047 --> 07:42.216

on the punishment pillow.

07:45.020 --> 07:48.255

Explain to me again how
an item I paid $3,000 for

08:07.811 --> 08:10.079
just two years ago
is worth less than something

08:10.080 --> 08:12.348
that came
with a dipping sauce!

08:13.884 --> 08:17.153
A Happy Meal toy reminds
people of a sweeter time,

08:17.154 --> 08:20.423
a simpler time,
a pre-Kardashian time.

08:21.725 --> 08:22.892
Attention, attention!

08:22.893 --> 08:24.827
I have something
very important here.

08:24.828 --> 08:27.563
The results of your DNA test
proving your mother was Asian

08:27.564 --> 08:29.765
and your father
was a pine nut?

08:31.335 --> 08:32.969
No, we got our letter grade

08:32.970 --> 08:35.705
from the city
health inspector's office.

08:38.475 --> 08:40.943
[Gasps] Whoo!
We got a "B"!

08:40.943 --> 08:42.477
That's the first "B"
I ever got

08:42.479 --> 08:45.548
I didn't have
to French kiss for.

08:45.549 --> 08:47.316
A "B"?
No, no, no, no!

08:47.317 --> 08:49.118
This boy don't play
with no Bs.

08:49.119 --> 08:52.321
I'm calling that little tease,
Miss Jean Rotello, right now.

08:54.224 --> 08:56.692
This isn't good.
Asians don't do well with Bs.

08:56.693 --> 08:59.061
At Wharton, I got a "B,"
and the Japanese kid

08:59.062 --> 09:01.797
who sat next to me
killed himself.

09:06.203 --> 09:08.738
Oleg, I'm kind of getting used
to this look now.

09:08.739 --> 09:11.774
You kind of look like
Bin Laden's ghost.

09:14.611 --> 09:16.746
Good night, girls.

09:16.747 --> 09:19.215
I'm going to go over and spend
the night at Sophie's.

09:19.216 --> 09:20.550
No, maybe not.

09:20.551 --> 09:21.617
Why would you say that?

09:21.618 --> 09:24.921
Because she can't
stop herself.

09:24.922 --> 09:27.456
It's just, she might like
a little space sometimes.

09:27.457 --> 09:29.292
She needs space?
Did she say that?

09:29.293 --> 09:33.663
- Not in so many words.
- No, those were the words.

09:33.664 --> 09:35.831
Look, Sophie
loves having you around.

09:35.832 --> 09:37.099
It's just, she told us that
you're getting

09:37.100 --> 09:38.768
a little too comfortable there
when she came over

09:38.769 --> 09:40.670
to sell all your stuff
at our yard sale.

09:41.738 --> 09:44.840
- I know how that sounds--
- And yet, you keep going.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.445
Oleg, Sophie is just feeling
a little smothered.

09:49.446 --> 09:50.846
She feels smothered?

09:50.847 --> 09:54.083
Have you ever tried
motorboating those cans of hers?

09:57.454 --> 10:00.890
Once, but I was very drunk
at the time.

10:05.462 --> 10:06.996
Just make a few changes,

10:06.997 --> 10:08.564
and everything will
be right back on track.

10:08.565 --> 10:10.333
And stop talking now.

10:10.334 --> 10:13.169
Make some changes?
That's all I've done for her.

10:13.170 --> 10:15.871
I changed my furniture,
I changed my ways.

10:15.872 --> 10:18.941
I changed my underwear
more than once a week.

10:21.345 --> 10:25.715
That's it.
No more changing for Han...

10:25.716 --> 10:28.184
And no more changing
for Sophie.

10:32.856 --> 10:36.392
I'm done changing.
I'm back, baby.

10:36.393 --> 10:38.561
Spread the word!

10:46.737 --> 10:50.873
I think he's gonna be
spreading more than the word.

10:50.874 --> 10:52.675
I want to kill someone!

10:52.676 --> 10:55.978
Why, did they cancel
<i>Suite Life of Zack and Cody?</i>

10:59.516 --> 11:01.984
No, I just got off the phone
with the restaurant inspector--

11:01.985 --> 11:04.053
She answered her phone
at this time of night?

11:04.054 --> 11:07.256
Come on, it's not like
she was out on the town.

11:07.257 --> 11:08.624
Han!

11:08.625 --> 11:11.861

might stand for "Bitch."

because of the conditions

off the dishwasher area.

I didn't even know we had
a back room, did you?

11:19.536 --> 11:21.904
No, but of course there's
a mysterious back room

11:21.905 --> 11:23.305
in this new upside down world,

and Donna Karan is a no one!

11:31.882 --> 11:33.315
Oh, there it is.

11:33.316 --> 11:34.750
I always thought
that was the property

11:34.751 --> 11:36.252
of the bar next door.

11:36.253 --> 11:38.254
If we share a door with a bar,

11:38.255 --> 11:42.758

to get longer and drunker.

an emergency crew to come

to get my "A."

and I can do it.

15:49.357 --> 15:51.424
and you're so chipper.

15:51.425 --> 15:53.960
I'm "chipper,"
to use your word, because

15:53.961 --> 15:56.763
we're working to earn money to
move our business brand forward.

15:56.764 --> 15:58.298

better be worth it.

it like that?

around it,

or something.

around things,

16:18.786 --> 16:20.620

on a word,

16:20.621 --> 16:23.456
that word would be,
"seminar"!

16:23.457 --> 16:25.125
Oh, and "branding"!

16:25.126 --> 16:28.328

on purpose!

an accident!

that I know how to do business.

17:07.334 --> 17:10.002
Sorry that you think you know
how to do business,

17:10.003 --> 17:12.571
and maybe that's why
our first business failed.

17:13.073 --> 17:16.742

weed breaks every single day

17:16.743 --> 17:18.178
instead of making work calls,

our business failed.

more weed breaks,
