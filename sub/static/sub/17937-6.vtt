00:13.000 --> 00:15.759
Emergency services.
What service do you require?

00:15.760 --> 00:19.639
Police, ambulance?
It's about that girl, Sophie Marks.

00:19.640 --> 00:22.519
The one that went missing.

00:22.520 --> 00:26.199
You need to look up at
Salt's Quarry, on the moor.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.399
Sorry, sir. Police or ambulance?

00:28.400 --> 00:31.279
Listen! Under the Three Hares.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.759
That's where she is.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.000
I'm sorry, that's all I know.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.680
Cheers.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.680
Call that tea?

00:49.160 --> 00:50.960
I've tasted better rainwater.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.679
You need to let me past.
Sorry, ma'am.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.279
- That might be my daughter!
- Sorry, ma'am, you can't go down there.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.039
Oh, no.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.680
What's she doing here?

01:04.200 --> 01:06.719
Is nothing in that
office confidential?

01:06.720 --> 01:08.240
Yvonne!

01:10.440 --> 01:13.279
Yvonne, you can't be here, love.
Is this it? Is this is where she is?

01:13.280 --> 01:15.760
We've had an anonymous tip-off,
that's all.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.160
This is the place.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.120
I know it is.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.359
Don't get your hopes up, love.
Found something, Phil.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.999
Guv? Yeah?
I think we've found something.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.600
Oh!

01:58.320 --> 02:02.279
No need to renew, Charlie.
Won't be needing these any more.

02:02.280 --> 02:05.439
Judge Farley, isn't it,
in charge of the appeal?

02:05.440 --> 02:07.399
I'd hang on to those, if I were you.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.679
I've looked that judge
square in the eyes

02:09.680 --> 02:12.039
and he knows an innocent man
when he sees one.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.439
I'm sure he does.

02:14.440 --> 02:18.039
So, like I said,
best hang on to them.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.799
I reckon you're the one who's going to
be ending his days in here, Mr Arnold.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.400
Not me.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.840
Get back to your cell.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.760
What you got for me?

02:55.880 --> 02:57.520
Oh!

02:59.720 --> 03:03.200
I will catch the joker that phoned
this in, Yvonne. I promise.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.560
I thought this was it.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.919
I thought we'd found her this time!

03:10.920 --> 03:13.559
Well, we won't rest until we do.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.000
This is your fault! The lot of you!

03:17.040 --> 03:20.480
If you'd done your job in the first
place, she'd still be alive!

03:32.200 --> 03:34.520
He's not breathing!
Get an ambulance!

03:37.720 --> 03:39.720
Step away!

03:55.000 --> 03:56.599
Get him off him! Get him off!

03:56.600 --> 03:58.440
Step away! Step away!

04:35.320 --> 04:37.759
I've... I've got my
bellybutton pierced.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.999
Last week, actually. It really hurt.
You carrying anything sharp?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.280
Anything that could be used
as a weapon?

04:45.760 --> 04:50.039
Couldn't they, you know, like,
file it down and use it as a knife?

04:50.040 --> 04:52.799
Ms Fordham-Bryce?
Oh, please, call me Mags.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.560
Thanks for coming so quickly.
If you'd just follow me?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.359
I understand it was
a suspected overdose?

05:01.360 --> 05:04.239
Heroin. It's the governor's curse.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.679
Can't keep the damn stuff
out of the place.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.919
It's tragic. He was eligible
for parole next year.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.479
Was he, like, super dangerous?

05:12.480 --> 05:15.519
Not unless you were a jeweller
or a pawnbroker.

05:15.520 --> 05:19.239
Charlie Macendrick was serving
three years for burglary.

05:19.240 --> 05:22.799
And, between ourselves, it sounds
like he was bloody good at it.

05:22.800 --> 05:26.519
There's even a rumour he had a
secret stash hidden on the outside.

05:26.520 --> 05:28.199
Did he?

05:28.200 --> 05:29.799
In my experience,

05:29.800 --> 05:32.480
drug addicts aren't known for
their financial prudence.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.160
Keep moving.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.959
If there's, like, an emergency,

05:40.960 --> 05:46.519
or I need to, you know,
get out now, what do I do?

05:46.520 --> 05:49.359
Shouting, "Help"
usually does the trick.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.240
Wouldn't you say, Mr Arnold?
Works a treat. Right.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.760
Yep.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.519
This was their cell.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.479
That was Charlie's bed.

06:06.480 --> 06:11.319
Malik Negasi said that he was
unconscious when he found him.

06:11.320 --> 06:12.679
You don't believe him.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.759
26 years, I've been doing this.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.359
You learn to take everything
with a pinch of salt.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.119
Wow, that's ages. That's, like,
before I was born.

06:20.120 --> 06:23.560
My mates call it a life sentence,
but without the free meals.

06:26.160 --> 06:29.040
I knew he was a dead man
the minute I laid eyes on him.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.279
Dead men all look the same,
don't they?

06:33.280 --> 06:34.720
Er... Jane?

06:36.920 --> 06:38.480
It's addressed to you.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.479
Dear Ms Kennedy.

06:46.480 --> 06:49.759
Sincere apologies, I'm not able
to meet you in person today,

06:49.760 --> 06:52.439
but I have a prior engagement.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.839
I wish to share
some information relating to

06:54.840 --> 06:57.119
Charlie Macendrick's death.

06:57.120 --> 07:01.159
If you could return at your earliest
convenience, I'd be most obliged.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.680
Yours sincerely, Sidney.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.280
Who's Sidney?
Sidney Sutton, Charlie's cellmate.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.119
The Sidney Sutton?
There's only one, thank God.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.039
Isn't he in the middle of an appeal?
Exactly.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.439
So whatever it is
he's so desperate to tell you,

07:15.440 --> 07:17.520
it'll have to wait till the morning.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.759
Creepy, him knowing
you'd be there like that.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.399
It's what all the papers said
about him, one step ahead.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.959
He was convicted of murdering
one of his pupils, wasn't he?

07:43.960 --> 07:46.119
Yeah. Sophie Marks. That's it.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.479
She used to live around the corner
from us when I was a kid.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.559
What, you knew her?
Yeah. Everyone knew Sophie.

07:51.560 --> 07:52.999
She was one of the cool kids.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.239
She used to hang around the pub
and smoke dope on the beach.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.759
They never found a body, did they?

07:57.760 --> 08:01.239
No, but somebody did see her getting a lift
with Sidney the night she disappeared.

08:01.240 --> 08:05.159
And then the police found that
strand of her hair in his car.

08:05.160 --> 08:08.479
Circumstantial evidence. That'll be
why he's appealing his conviction.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.999
Hey, have you got
Charlie Macendrick's PM results yet?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.639
I've got the DCI breathing down
my neck. Yeah, they rushed them through.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.959
It was a heroin overdose,
as we suspected.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.719
But he had a needle puncture
in his upper arm,

08:17.720 --> 08:19.719
which is unusual for an addict.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.239
Also, significant amounts of opiates
in his bloodstream.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.519
Over four times the normal amount.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.919
And also, it noted bruising
to his ribcage,

08:26.920 --> 08:30.159
but they think that's from when
they tried to resuscitate him.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.039
I'll e-mail it to you.

08:32.039 --> 08:35.080
Jane's got a pen pal -
Sidney Sutton.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.359
Ah. What's that about?

08:38.360 --> 08:40.958
I don't know. He wants to see me.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.999
Well, you be careful.
He's a nasty bit of work.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.280
Excuse me.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.320
Lights going out!

09:17.040 --> 09:19.719
Have you seen the car keys?
Haven't you got a spare?

09:19.720 --> 09:22.439
That was the spare.
Still going, then?

09:22.440 --> 09:23.879
Oh, Mum, not this again.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.799
I'm a grown woman,
a respected professional.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.479
I don't need anyone holding my hand.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.039
I don't want that man
getting into your head. He's evil.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.559
He is.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.439
Poor Yvonne. Imagine not knowing

09:33.440 --> 09:36.359
what happened to your daughter
for all these years.

09:36.360 --> 09:39.079
Beth, have you seen the car key?
Mum! Can't you use the spare?

09:39.080 --> 09:41.319
If he gets off and shows his face
around here,

09:41.320 --> 09:43.759
I might not be responsible
for my actions.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.879
Hey, Gran, look, it's Stace.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.319
She cracks me up.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.079
Morning, all. Morning.

09:49.080 --> 09:52.639
Charlie Macendrick's records. Ah.
So you're up to speed. Thanks.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.559
I put some selfies up like that.
I got 23 followers now.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.559
Don't tell me you're on Instagram,
too?

09:57.560 --> 09:59.439
All the kids are doing it.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.199
Oh, I give up. I'll order a taxi.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.999
All the way to Hamley Moor?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.479
Why not let Davey drive you?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.599
He can sit in on the interview
an' all. Mum!

10:07.600 --> 10:10.520
No, I don't think Jane
wants me sticking my oar in. Hm!

10:12.680 --> 10:15.279
But if I could just
sit in on the interview,

10:15.280 --> 10:18.239
it might be beneficial to
our investigation, as well.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.360
You know, only if
you're OK with that?

10:21.600 --> 10:24.199
Er... yeah, but it's my interview.
Is that clear?

10:24.200 --> 10:25.800
Yeah, crystal. Good.

10:28.280 --> 10:31.080
Oh, look. They were under my nose
the whole time.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.320
We'll take my car.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.319
He was a good man.

10:45.320 --> 10:49.279
First cellmate I've had in years,
which was a joy.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.759
He'd worked so long
in the prison library,

10:51.760 --> 10:53.279
there was nothing he didn't know.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.720
So it was a meeting of minds.

10:57.080 --> 11:01.559
But he was weak, and, er... he
couldn't kick that junk habit.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.159
Heroin? Cocaine?

11:04.160 --> 11:07.999
He'd lick the polish off the floor
if he thought he'd get a high off of it.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.480
And the dealers in here, they,
er... they knew how to play him.

11:12.640 --> 11:15.119
When he was desperate,
he would do anything.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.800
Anything.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.480
Could I have some water, Mr Arnold,
if you don't mind?

11:25.800 --> 11:27.239
Chilled.

11:27.240 --> 11:29.359
All right, Mr Sutton,
we haven't got all day.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.719
So, if you do have any information,
perhaps you could tell us?

11:32.720 --> 11:34.279
His dealer knew.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.999
About Charlie's stash.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.479
And they weren't going to stop
until they had every last penny.

11:39.480 --> 11:42.359
Charlie didn't have any money.
How would you know?

11:42.360 --> 11:44.479
Well, he spent everything
he robbed.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.399
Why do you think
he carried on doing it?

11:46.400 --> 11:49.280
You're wrong. He had some put by
for when he got out.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.639
Only, his dealer wanted it all
for himself.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.119
Are you saying Charlie Macendrick
was murdered for his money?

11:57.120 --> 12:00.919
Not a very clever move, though,
is it? Killing your best customer.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.399
You'll have to do better than that,
Sid.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.839
I might be out of here in a few
days. I don't need this aggravation.

12:06.840 --> 12:09.199
I simply want justice for Charlie.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.239
If you have any
concrete information...

12:11.240 --> 12:13.399
I know what I know.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.719
That man will stop at nothing. Who?

12:15.720 --> 12:17.559
Malik Negasi, of course.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.919
The one who found him.

12:19.920 --> 12:23.919
Where's your proof? He's already done
his due diligence on you, Ms Kennedy.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.759
Smuggled a phone in yesterday.
He knows all about you.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.600
And your daughter.

12:29.760 --> 12:32.639
Sorr...? Hang on. No. My daughter?

12:32.640 --> 12:34.759
Beth, isn't it?
All right, that's enough.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.399
I think that's what I heard him say.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.119
"Know your enemy", that's his motto.
Enough.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.319
And once he's tracked her down
online, who knows what he'll do?

12:42.320 --> 12:43.799
What, to Beth? Stop this!

12:43.800 --> 12:45.999
He'll find out all about her,
go through her photos,

12:46.000 --> 12:47.999
share them with his mates.
That's enough!

12:48.000 --> 12:50.679
Pretty soon, she'll be a pin-up
for all the weirdos in here.

12:50.680 --> 12:54.799
THAT'S ENOUGH!
You need to calm down, Sergeant.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.319
You see, this is what they're like.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.879
They'll do anything
to get a conviction.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.559
They will use their fists,
plant evidence.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.519
They don't give a damn
about the truth.

13:04.520 --> 13:08.280
Yeah? Why don't you start talking
about the truth? Davey, stop it!

13:09.800 --> 13:11.679
I need you to leave. What?

13:11.680 --> 13:14.440
Get out. You serious? Get out!

13:31.840 --> 13:33.799
Thanks.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.639
Beth. Hi, it's me. Um...

13:36.640 --> 13:39.159
Just checking in
to see how your day's going.

13:39.160 --> 13:40.799
Give me a call back
if you get a chance.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.800
Otherwise, I'll see you tonight.
OK, bye.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.079
You promised. That was my interview.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.639
He was playing games, Jane,
that's what he does.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.479
He wasn't going to tell you
anything.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.759
You think the thought of that lot
knowing about Beth

13:59.760 --> 14:01.239
doesn't get to me as well?

14:01.240 --> 14:03.199
But the minute we let them
push our buttons,

14:03.200 --> 14:04.919
we may as well give up and go home.

14:04.920 --> 14:09.279
I mean, did he say anything
after I left? Huh? Did he?

14:09.280 --> 14:12.440
No, of course he didn't.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.879
Oi! Oi!

14:16.880 --> 14:18.880
Charming.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.320
Prohibited item!

14:34.240 --> 14:37.839
That's got nothing to do with me. You've
disappointed me, Malik. I believed in you.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.360
This is the one.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.199
Segregation unit.
Removal of privileges for one week.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.199
This is a stitch-up!
You can shut up!

14:45.200 --> 14:47.679
Get your hands off me, man!
Come on, son.

14:47.680 --> 14:51.000
Don't let them pin this on me.
This has got nothing to do with me!

15:02.640 --> 15:06.559
Ms Kennedy? I'm Yvonne Marks.
Mrs Marks. How can I help?

15:06.560 --> 15:09.200
They're saying you've interviewed
Sidney Sutton.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.959
Who's saying?

15:11.960 --> 15:14.559
There's not a lot about that man
that gets past me.

15:14.560 --> 15:17.879
Is this to do with the appeal?
Is there new evidence?

15:17.880 --> 15:19.279
Oh. Er... no.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.839
Mr Sutton's helping us
on an unrelated case.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.479
It has nothing to do with
your daughter.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.840
I thought... When I heard...

15:28.160 --> 15:30.799
He didn't even mention Sophie?

15:30.800 --> 15:33.359
There was an incident at the prison,
that's all.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.479
He's going to get off, isn't he?

15:36.480 --> 15:40.159
Well, that's for the court
to decide. It's not right.

15:40.160 --> 15:43.960
He'll be walking free and I still
won't know what he did to my Sophie.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.839
She used to think
she was so grown up.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.960
But she was still a kid deep down.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.040
She must have been so scared.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.680
It's the not knowing
I can't live with.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.199
I really wish there was something
I could do to help.

16:06.200 --> 16:09.319
But anything he says could give
a clue to what he did with her.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.400
Or what he might have done with her.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.000
I'm sorry.

16:18.880 --> 16:22.040
If none of you will help me,
I'll have to do it myself, won't I?

16:23.920 --> 16:26.999
It's Maggie Fordham-Bryce
on the phone.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.760
Can you put her through, please? Yeah.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.320
Maggie.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.879
Have you got any idea
how long I had to wait out there?

16:40.880 --> 16:44.279
Maggie Fordham-Bryce called.
They found a phone in Malik's cell.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.559
He'd used it to download
some of Beth's Instagram photos,

16:46.560 --> 16:49.159
so Sutton was right.
About that, maybe.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.039
I'm looking at the facts.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.239
You're the one whose judgement's
all over the place.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.719
Meaning? Meaning I saw the look
on your face

16:55.720 --> 16:57.440
when he said police
planted evidence.

17:00.360 --> 17:03.119
Was the evidence tampered with
to get a conviction, yes or no?

17:03.120 --> 17:05.440
Like I said, it was before my time.
Davey!

17:17.119 --> 17:18.559
Between you and me,

17:18.560 --> 17:21.959
the way the evidence turned up
that late in the day...

17:21.960 --> 17:23.799
They'd been through the car twice,

17:23.800 --> 17:25.999
they found a strand of hair
the third time.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.799
It never really felt right.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.199
What a mess.

17:29.200 --> 17:32.519
But he did it, Jane, he did it.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.159
Sidney Sutton was sacked from
his last two jobs

17:35.160 --> 17:36.719
because of inappropriate behaviour.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.799
There was just never enough evidence
to convict him.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.399
But he did it.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.440
And I won't rest
until I've put him away for good.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.599
I need to talk to Beth.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.679
Are you going to tell her?

17:49.680 --> 17:51.159
You think I want to?

17:51.160 --> 17:53.960
Well, she doesn't need to know.
It might only scare her.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.599
OK, I'll text you
when I've had a look.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.760
OK. Got to go. Bye.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.399
Everyone's gone crazy
for Stacey's new photos.

18:14.400 --> 18:18.319
She's got, like, er... 300 likes
already.

18:18.320 --> 18:20.240
Can you believe that? Yeah, I can.

18:21.480 --> 18:24.079
I was looking at your photos
earlier.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.919
You know anyone can see
what you put up there?

18:25.920 --> 18:27.319
You've been spying on me?

18:27.320 --> 18:30.719
No, I'm being a responsible parent.
Yeah, same difference.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.319
I don't want you putting photos
up for anyone to see. It's not safe.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.199
It's just a few photos.
Can you just chill out?

18:35.200 --> 18:38.679
Beth, I'm serious. Either make your account
private, or I'm taking your phone away.

18:38.680 --> 18:41.880
No-one else's mum is like this!
No-one else's mum knows what I know.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.639
Hello. Hiya!

18:48.640 --> 18:52.319
The police have sent over the CCTV.

18:52.320 --> 18:54.319
An hour before he died,

18:54.320 --> 18:58.000
Charlie had this massive argument
in the library.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.839
Oh, that smells really good.
Any going spare?

19:00.840 --> 19:03.640
Clint, who did he argue with?
Ah. Malik Negasi.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.199
I think it's time we had a word.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.519
Malik Negasi, serving life.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.439
Member of a gang that stabbed
a kid outside a multiplex

19:16.440 --> 19:19.039
for dealing grass on their turf...

19:19.040 --> 19:22.159
Huh! Judge said
he was the ringleader.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.959
With a taste for teenage girls?

19:23.960 --> 19:25.840
Well, no, not according to this.

19:27.320 --> 19:30.279
So, what if Charlie wasn't killed
accidentally,

19:30.280 --> 19:33.319
like Sutton says?
Come here a minute.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.039
Oh, no, here we go.
Come on, stand up.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.560
All right, all right.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.279
Turn around. Look, I know we've had
our differences,

19:41.280 --> 19:43.919
but I'm sure we can work it out.
Just do it, you idiot.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.719
OK, so the PM said that there was
a puncture wound in his arm,

19:46.720 --> 19:48.519
which is unusual. Right.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.199
So, what if Charlie
was approached from behind

19:51.200 --> 19:53.119
and someone got him
in a headlock...?

19:53.120 --> 19:56.519
Oh, hang on. So... like that?
Squeeze.

19:56.520 --> 20:01.639
OK. Reminds me of the time we
played Twister, minus the vodka.

20:01.640 --> 20:05.079
OK, so they squeeze until
he loses consciousness,

20:05.080 --> 20:07.599
which means he'd fall back. Argh!

20:07.600 --> 20:10.919
They pin him down, that would
explain the bruising on the ribs,

20:10.920 --> 20:13.239
while they administer the drugs.

20:13.240 --> 20:16.160
Yeah, but by who,
and what's the motive?

20:17.240 --> 20:18.999
Maybe Sutton was telling the truth.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.599
About his mythical stash of money?

20:20.600 --> 20:24.399
The only thing that matters is if people
believe it exists. That's motive enough.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.399
Maybe they didn't mean to kill him.

20:27.400 --> 20:30.919
Maybe they just wanted information
and it went too far.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.239
Well, there is one way to find out.

20:33.240 --> 20:35.559
As long as you promise
not to step out of line again.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.639
Is that clear? Crystal. Ohhh!

20:38.640 --> 20:40.360
Could you let me up, please?

20:43.680 --> 20:46.799
So, you want to tell us
what the argument was about?

20:46.800 --> 20:47.999
My books were overdue.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.879
Malik, you're really
not helping yourself.

20:50.880 --> 20:54.079
If you ever want to get your privileges
back, you'd better start cooperating.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.239
You're not going to listen to
a word I say either way.

20:56.240 --> 20:59.239
And that phone has got nothing
to do with me.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.599
Is it true you dealt drugs
to Charlie Macendrick?

21:01.600 --> 21:04.559
Drugs? Me? Yeah. We read your file.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.519
Old habits die hard.
I left that all behind.

21:07.520 --> 21:10.279
How Charlie got his fix has got
nothing to do with me.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.639
We also heard you were sniffing
around Charlie's money.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.000
His what?!

21:15.320 --> 21:17.400
Where you lot getting this from?

21:19.320 --> 21:22.079
Sutton's been stirring the pot
again, hasn't he?

21:22.080 --> 21:25.039
This money he had put by
on the outside,

21:25.040 --> 21:27.359
you wanted a slice of that
for yourself, did you?

21:27.360 --> 21:30.799
You people! Sutton is who
me and Charlie were arguing about.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.799
Charlie Mac was terrified of him.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.119
I was trying to get him
to transfer to a different cell,

21:35.120 --> 21:36.719
but he was too scared
to even do that.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.480
Oh, so, you were trying to
protect him? Yeah. Yeah? Really?

21:41.040 --> 21:44.040
It's true. Yeah, there was money.

21:46.120 --> 21:49.559
He even offered me some to try and
protect him. Said he'd pay my fam.

21:49.560 --> 21:53.520
But the truth is, in here,
you got to look out for yourself.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.600
Ain't nobody can do that for you.

22:06.680 --> 22:08.599
Good doggy.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.720
Reckon they bought that?

22:12.040 --> 22:14.319
Charlie Mac had money on him
all right.

22:14.320 --> 22:17.279
And the fool gone and spilled
his guts on where he hid it.

22:17.280 --> 22:21.360
And why should that interest me?

22:23.320 --> 22:25.919
It's no secret you're short on cash,
Mr Arnold.

22:25.920 --> 22:29.319
Old threads, battered old motor.

22:29.320 --> 22:32.839
Everybody in here knows about this
custody thing with you and your kid.

22:32.840 --> 22:35.800
I'm thinking you might want
a piece of the action.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.720
Get in.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.519
Yes, sir.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.999
The police are reporting to us
every half an hour

23:02.000 --> 23:03.640
and we've alerted the media.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.400
Yes, sir. Of course.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.159
What a mess!

23:10.160 --> 23:12.079
When did you realise he'd gone?

23:12.080 --> 23:14.399
He failed to answer
the wake-up call.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.399
I thought this place
was virtually watertight?

23:16.400 --> 23:19.279
Director of Prisons
said exactly the same thing.

23:19.280 --> 23:23.199
I put my neck on the line for Malik
and this is the thanks I get.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.199
Any idea where he'd go?
There's a rumour on the wing

23:26.200 --> 23:28.439
that he's heading for
Charlie Macendrick's money.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.599
All right, well, we've alerted
the ports and airports

23:30.600 --> 23:32.359
in case he tries to leave
the country.

23:32.360 --> 23:33.959
I'm going to need a list of
his contacts,

23:33.960 --> 23:36.800
any phone calls he's made, visitors
he's had in the last three months.

23:38.320 --> 23:41.160
Looks like Sutton was telling
the truth. Yes?

23:45.120 --> 23:46.879
Thanks.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.679
What is it?

23:48.680 --> 23:51.439
Officer Ben Arnold
was here last night.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.840
He hasn't turned up for duty
this morning.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.959
A few days ago, Malik and Charlie
are having a pop at each other,

25:09.960 --> 25:13.240
now Malik and Ben are planning
the great escape together.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.880
Greed makes strange bedfellows.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.840
Is that Shakespeare?
Game of Thrones.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.399
You hear that, Ms Kennedy?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.679
That's what victory sounds like.

25:34.680 --> 25:37.559
In a few hours, I'll be a free man.

25:37.560 --> 25:40.879
You should have paid attention when I
told you about Malik, don't you think?

25:40.880 --> 25:44.079
If we're going to find out what happened
to Charlie, we need to find him.

25:44.080 --> 25:48.240
My bet is he's spending all of
Charlie's cash with that bent screw.

25:49.480 --> 25:53.159
You'd better keep that daughter
of yours locked up.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.399
Things that are precious
break so easily.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.279
Haven't you got to be somewhere?

25:57.280 --> 25:59.360
Hm. Hmm...

26:01.800 --> 26:04.159
Here's the list of visitors
you were after.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.999
Was all that ruckus for Sutton?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.279
He seems confident
he'll win his appeal.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.839
God help me if he does.

26:09.840 --> 26:12.600
The atmosphere in this place
is febrile enough.

26:14.560 --> 26:17.240
Guess who visited Malik twice
in the last week?

26:19.960 --> 26:23.399
Beth! Can you call me as soon as you
get this message? It's urgent.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.039
What?

26:25.040 --> 26:27.240
Well, you can't say urgent,
she'll never call.

26:32.520 --> 26:35.079
I'm busy. So are we, love.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.839
Malik Negasi. That ring a bell?

26:36.840 --> 26:39.359
'Course. He's escaped.
It's all over the news.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.359
Yvonne, we know you went to see him.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.919
Is there a law against that?

26:42.920 --> 26:45.959
A week ago, Malik Negasi
may have murdered another prisoner.

26:45.960 --> 26:49.359
A man called Charlie Macendrick. So, if you know
anything... Malik didn't murder anyone.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.719
Can't you see Sutton's
playing you all for fools?

26:51.720 --> 26:54.520
Well, why don't you help us, then?
Tell us what we're missing.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.559
I think I've found it!

27:10.560 --> 27:12.359
Get out, get out!

27:12.360 --> 27:15.879
26 years looking after you lot,

27:15.880 --> 27:18.120
I deserve every penny of this!

27:29.200 --> 27:31.079
Thank you.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.919
So, you were saying
Malik e-mailed you?

27:33.920 --> 27:36.239
I run a support group.
It's kind of victim support.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.079
We help each other through.
He got my address off the website.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.119
What did he say?

27:40.120 --> 27:43.759
He said he was going to help me
find my little girl.

27:43.760 --> 27:46.279
I thought it was some sick joke.

27:46.280 --> 27:49.719
But when I found out he was on the same
wing as Sutton, I paid him a visit.

27:49.720 --> 27:52.159
He wasn't happy about that,
that's for sure.

27:52.160 --> 27:55.279
He said if Sutton knew I'd gone
there, he was a dead man walking.

27:55.280 --> 27:58.599
But I told him,
I've waited too long for this.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.479
I needed some answers.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.119
All right. And...?

28:02.120 --> 28:05.360
He told me to be patient.
Told me to trust him.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.079
And I did.

28:08.080 --> 28:11.439
So, that's why you were so convinced
about the tip-off at Salt's Quarry.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.520
I really thought she would be there.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.239
But she wasn't, was she?

28:16.240 --> 28:17.959
Which is why you went back
a second time.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.679
I was ready to have it out with him!

28:19.680 --> 28:21.600
But he was a changed man.

28:23.040 --> 28:26.679
Told me about this friend of his,
this Charlie.

28:26.680 --> 28:29.279
Said Sutton had murdered him
and that he was next.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.759
Malik was scared. Really scared!

28:31.760 --> 28:35.599
Yeah, but that don't make any sense.
Why would Sutton take the risk?

28:35.600 --> 28:38.199
Because he talks in his sleep,
doesn't he?

28:38.200 --> 28:41.559
Charlie heard him talking about
burying something.

28:41.560 --> 28:44.879
He told Malik and the two of them
tried to piece it together.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.439
But Sutton cottoned on to
what they were up to.

28:47.440 --> 28:50.119
He could have gone to the governor.
She would have protected him.

28:50.120 --> 28:52.439
Malik doesn't trust anyone.

28:52.440 --> 28:55.400
Said he'd prefer to
sort it all out himself.

28:58.280 --> 29:01.639
Did you know that Malik
was going to escape?

29:01.640 --> 29:04.120
You really don't want to be lying
about something like that.

29:05.320 --> 29:09.359
You see, Malik broke out of prison this
morning with the help of a prison officer,

29:09.360 --> 29:11.839
and we think they were
after Charlie's money.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.039
No. Malik wasn't like that.

29:14.040 --> 29:16.559
He wanted to help me.

29:16.560 --> 29:20.039
If he really knows where Sophie's
buried, we can help him.

29:20.040 --> 29:22.520
But you need to tell us
everything you know.

29:28.640 --> 29:31.559
I left some supplies
up at Ballan Tor.

29:31.560 --> 29:34.759
Oh, Yvonne! You could get into serious
trouble for something like that.

29:34.760 --> 29:36.759
I don't care.

29:36.760 --> 29:40.999
For eight years,
you lot sat on your hands.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.479
Malik is the only one who has ever
done anything to help me find Sophie.

29:44.480 --> 29:48.440
So you can do what you want to me,
but I don't regret it for a second.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.359
Yeah. Up near Ballan Tor.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.239
So at least we know which direction
they're travelling in.

30:04.240 --> 30:07.120
Just let me know if you hear
anything. All right, thanks.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.919
Do you think Malik
really wanted to help her?

30:10.920 --> 30:13.999
I've been coming at this all wrong.
Sutton knew I'd get distracted

30:14.000 --> 30:17.759
with a story about Beth, and that's exactly
what he gave me. Why didn't I see it?!

30:17.760 --> 30:20.000
There is one way to find out.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.440
Mum?

30:43.520 --> 30:45.240
Mum?

30:50.400 --> 30:52.599
Gran?

30:52.600 --> 30:54.080
Is that you?

31:16.320 --> 31:19.199
All right. All right, thanks,
Maggie, thanks.

31:19.200 --> 31:22.559
Bingo. She's listened to the
recording we got of the tip-off.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.119
It's Charlie Macendrick.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.399
So, Malik's escaped
to the right location? Yeah.

31:26.400 --> 31:30.119
And she thinks Sutton may have planted
the phone in Malik's cell to frame him.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.959
So she was right about Malik
after all.

31:31.960 --> 31:36.279
Have you heard? They've overturned
Sidney Sutton's conviction.

31:36.280 --> 31:38.319
He's being released.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.440
All right, thanks.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.079
Ssh! Ssh! I'm not going to hurt you.
All right?

31:52.080 --> 31:55.319
I just need to speak to your mother.

31:55.320 --> 31:58.080
Please, just calm down. Ow!

31:59.560 --> 32:01.360
Argh! Argh!

32:03.400 --> 32:06.680
Emergency. Which service do you require?
Police! There's a man in my house!

32:07.840 --> 32:10.760
Help! Angel Cove House!

32:13.320 --> 32:15.079
It's like a kick in the guts,
isn't it?

32:15.080 --> 32:17.719
He's going to get away with it -
Sophie and Charlie,

32:17.720 --> 32:19.199
and I can't touch him.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.759
Malik should have called.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.079
Wherever he was going,
he should have been there by now.

32:23.080 --> 32:25.759
Maybe he got it wrong,
decided to keep on running.

32:25.760 --> 32:29.319
I knew I had one somewhere.
Mum uses it as a doorstop.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.599
This was the book in Malik's cell,
his only book.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.639
He'd been underlining, taking notes.

32:33.640 --> 32:35.239
I think Yvonne was right.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.159
I think he was trying to work out
where Sophie was buried

32:38.160 --> 32:40.039
based on what Charlie
was telling him.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.399
I get you. Well, we could
start back at Salt's Quarry,

32:42.400 --> 32:43.719
other quarries around there.

32:43.720 --> 32:47.239
What did they say about Three Hares?

32:47.240 --> 32:49.639
Also known as Tinners' Hares.

32:49.640 --> 32:51.679
An ancient symbol native to Devon

32:51.680 --> 32:54.159
depicting three hares
chasing each other's tails

32:54.160 --> 32:55.759
in a never-ending circle.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.640
I know how they feel.

32:59.080 --> 33:01.560
Mum?

33:03.320 --> 33:04.640
Mum, what's wrong?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.359
Get down. Get down!

33:12.360 --> 33:13.800
Stay there!

33:23.240 --> 33:27.120
All right, just, please, let me know
when you get something. OK.

33:29.520 --> 33:32.399
They're trying to find out where
Sutton went after he left the court.

33:32.400 --> 33:33.800
It's Sutton, isn't it?

33:35.640 --> 33:39.719
He was the one looking at photos of
Beth on that phone, it wasn't Malik!

33:39.720 --> 33:41.439
Sidney Sutton's got Beth?

33:41.440 --> 33:43.279
Sutton knows Malik's on to him.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.919
If he's got any sense, he'll be on
the first plane to South America.

33:45.920 --> 33:47.880
I was so stupid not to warn her.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.439
Look, I've got everyone on this.

33:52.440 --> 33:55.840
I won't let anything happen to Beth.
I promise you.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.880
I promise you that.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.199
Come on. Out!

34:13.199 --> 34:14.480
What do you want?

34:15.480 --> 34:18.159
I'm sorry, all right?

34:18.159 --> 34:22.518
Your mother is the only person
who can help me. Hm?

34:22.520 --> 34:24.359
She'll hear me out.

34:24.360 --> 34:27.478
And she'll know that
I'm not a murderer.

34:27.480 --> 34:28.960
What did you do?

34:30.280 --> 34:31.839
It was an accident.

34:31.840 --> 34:35.879
They have to know
it was an accident.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.839
Right, call her.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.279
I want to speak to her. Call her.

34:40.280 --> 34:42.199
And just her!

34:42.199 --> 34:44.518
No police. OK?

34:44.520 --> 34:48.478
There's a rumour that he's booked
on a flight tomorrow morning.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.918
So, you don't think it's him?

34:50.920 --> 34:53.159
I'm hoping Sutton's got
too much to lose.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.159
Jane Kennedy.

34:57.160 --> 34:59.119
Mum? Beth! Where are you?!

34:59.120 --> 35:00.480
Um...

35:01.880 --> 35:03.519
Down, down, down!

35:03.520 --> 35:07.279
Mrs Kennedy, this is Ben Arnold.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.959
Now, first, you have to believe me
when I say

35:09.960 --> 35:12.319
I never wanted
any of this to happen.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.599
So no police. Understand?!

35:14.600 --> 35:16.719
Ben, what have you done with her?!

35:16.720 --> 35:21.400
She's OK. Just do as I ask, OK?

35:22.640 --> 35:24.199
Salt's tin mine.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.199
You come alone and she'll be safe,

35:26.200 --> 35:30.359
just as long as you come alone.
So no police. Understand?!

35:30.360 --> 35:32.920
Not until I've told you the truth.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.039
Who's Ben?!

35:36.040 --> 35:38.759
It doesn't matter.
Beth's at Salt's tin mine.

35:38.760 --> 35:40.279
Call Davey. No!

35:40.280 --> 35:41.839
He said come alone.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.760
We have to think of
what's best for Beth.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.800
Beth?!

36:09.840 --> 36:12.799
Mum! Mum! Shut up!

36:12.800 --> 36:16.319
Beth! Mum! I told you to come alone!

36:16.320 --> 36:18.639
Stay back!
I'm just here as a friend.

36:18.640 --> 36:21.159
Ben, please let her go.
Not until you hear me out!

36:21.160 --> 36:24.759
Argh! Hey-hey-hey-hey.
Please. Please. Now, listen to me!

36:24.760 --> 36:27.839
You look for the good in people, hm?

36:27.840 --> 36:32.399
So you have to understand
it was an accident.

36:32.400 --> 36:39.439
Malik, he... he told me that
we were digging for Charlie's stash.

36:39.440 --> 36:42.240
He promised me!

36:49.840 --> 36:51.440
This isn't Charlie's stash!

36:53.400 --> 36:54.840
What is this?!

36:56.120 --> 36:58.119
Ohhhhh!

36:58.120 --> 37:00.719
Her mother has a right to know
what happened.

37:00.720 --> 37:03.039
We're giving her peace
after what Sutton did.

37:03.040 --> 37:06.599
Oh! I need money! I need money!

37:06.600 --> 37:08.639
I've given up everything for this!

37:08.640 --> 37:10.639
We're doing a good thing.
A good thing?!

37:10.640 --> 37:12.719
What are you talking about,
a good thing?!

37:12.720 --> 37:15.959
She's dead! No, no, no, no!
The girl is dead!

37:15.960 --> 37:18.039
You fool!

37:18.040 --> 37:20.719
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Argh!

37:20.720 --> 37:23.080
Oh!

38:08.880 --> 38:11.959
Please let her go. I promise, I will
give you all the help I can.

38:11.960 --> 38:13.479
We both will.

38:13.480 --> 38:14.880
You don't care about me.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.239
You'd only care about me
if I was dead!

38:19.240 --> 38:24.000
All the time and the millions wasted
trying to find a dead girl.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.759
Just a few thousand pounds
would have sorted me out, hm?

38:28.760 --> 38:31.639
Oh, but no-one listens
until it's too late.

38:31.640 --> 38:34.519
No, no, no. We're the same,
Ben, you and me.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.039
You think I don't get hacked off
with the system?

38:37.040 --> 38:38.999
Where's the breaks for the man
on the street, eh?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.359
Exactly. No-one cares.

38:41.360 --> 38:44.320
Oh, I care. I care, Ben.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.999
That's why I'm saying, mate,
you've got to let her go.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.719
Stay back, stay back.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.799
Because if you don't,

38:52.800 --> 38:55.159
you're no better than those cons
you lock up every day.

38:55.160 --> 38:58.240
And how are you going to look at yourself
in the mirror knowing that, huh?

39:01.160 --> 39:03.680
Come on, eh? Come on, Ben.

39:15.960 --> 39:17.440
Too late.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.760
Are you sure? Are you sure, Ben?

39:30.240 --> 39:32.679
Oh, Davey. It's too dangerous.

39:32.680 --> 39:34.639
Yeah, I know, I know that.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.679
Not a lot of choice, though,
is there?

39:36.680 --> 39:38.200
Be careful.

39:39.840 --> 39:41.520
Really slow.

39:48.240 --> 39:50.040
Be careful!

39:58.440 --> 39:59.760
I've got a faint pulse!

40:02.840 --> 40:04.240
Yeah. Yeah, he's alive!

40:06.560 --> 40:09.880
All right, young man, come on.
Come on, hang in there.

40:24.760 --> 40:26.399
Hey. You get any sleep?

40:26.400 --> 40:27.879
Yeah, some.

40:27.880 --> 40:29.399
I'm fine, Mum, really.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.159
It could have been a lot worse.

40:31.160 --> 40:34.239
Yeah, I know. I just can't believe
he tracked me down like that.

40:34.240 --> 40:36.999
So stupid. You should listen to
your mum once in a while.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.399
You can talk,
uploading all those selfies.

40:39.400 --> 40:42.159
Yeah, well, Mick's put a stop
to that.

40:42.160 --> 40:46.440
Some of my followers
went a bit too far.

40:48.480 --> 40:51.359
Hey. Hey. Davey.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.239
Thanks for yesterday.

40:53.240 --> 40:56.199
Ah, it's all right.
All in a day's work, innit?

40:56.200 --> 40:58.599
So, thought you'd want to hear
this first hand.

40:58.600 --> 41:00.759
The remains were Sophie Marks',
weren't they?

41:00.760 --> 41:03.559
Yeah. DNA's come back, it's a match.

41:03.560 --> 41:07.479
And they arrested Sutton
at the airport, so it's over.

41:07.480 --> 41:09.239
Thank God for that.

41:09.240 --> 41:12.199
Do you want to stay for breakfast?
There's plenty to go around.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.279
Er... no, I can't.

41:14.280 --> 41:16.999
Annette's bending my ear
about cutting the grass.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.119
And it looks like rain later, so...

41:19.120 --> 41:20.760
Maybe another day.

41:21.960 --> 41:24.080
Yeah, another day.
