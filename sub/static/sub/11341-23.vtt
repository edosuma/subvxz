10:52.773 --> 10:54.706
How well did you know her?

10:54.708 --> 10:56.074
Used to flirt.

10:56.076 --> 10:58.810
You know. She always said
I couldn't handle her.

10:58.812 --> 11:00.211
She was right.

11:00.213 --> 11:03.181
So I'd buy her drinks.
She liked when I buy her drinks.

11:03.183 --> 11:05.317
Was she
that kind of girl?

11:05.319 --> 11:07.719
Party girl, maybe?

11:07.721 --> 11:10.555
It was hard to tell
when she was loaded or not.

11:10.557 --> 11:13.725
I mean, she was always off.

11:13.727 --> 11:16.761
Like she had her own song
goin' on in her head.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.264
Mack the Knife.

11:27.139 --> 11:29.341
Reid: Let me ask you,
did Abigail come in often?

11:29.343 --> 11:31.409
Was she a regular
customer?

11:31.411 --> 11:32.777
What was that?

11:32.779 --> 11:36.114
Mack the Knife.

11:36.116 --> 11:38.416
Was that the song
in her head?

11:38.418 --> 11:41.920
No. It was the name
of her last...date.

11:41.922 --> 11:43.054
You know what I mean?

11:43.056 --> 11:44.556
Yes, I do.

11:44.558 --> 11:48.126
Have you ever met
this Mack the Knife?

11:48.128 --> 11:49.461
No.

11:49.463 --> 11:51.162
She told me about him,

11:51.164 --> 11:52.731
said he was a good tipper.

11:52.733 --> 11:54.833
Do you know where
we could talk to him?

12:04.910 --> 12:07.812
Would you prefer
to chat privately?

12:07.814 --> 12:10.682
I can't.

12:10.684 --> 12:12.851
Ok.

12:15.187 --> 12:17.822
Why don't we just
have a little chat,

12:17.824 --> 12:19.524
right here. You don't
have to look at me.

12:19.526 --> 12:22.994
Don't move your head.
Just keep looking down.

12:22.996 --> 12:26.998
Just doing my best
to be charming, if you don't mind.

12:28.601 --> 12:30.035
Could you lean over

12:30.037 --> 12:33.738
and take this card
from me?

12:35.875 --> 12:39.444
[Laughs] See?
I'm not so bad.

12:39.446 --> 12:42.847
Come on, we're just talkin' it up,
havin' some fun, right?

12:42.849 --> 12:46.818
Why don't you flash me
that pretty little smile of yours.

12:46.820 --> 12:48.520
And then maybe
slap me on the shoulder

12:48.522 --> 12:50.855
like maybe I'm trying
to get fresh or something, huh?

12:50.857 --> 12:52.457
No? Yeah? Yeah.

12:52.459 --> 12:53.458
Dirty boy.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.326
You wish.

12:55.328 --> 12:58.029
All right, well, you can't blame
a guy for trying.

12:58.031 --> 12:59.364
Nice to meet you.

13:00.766 --> 13:02.934
Reid:
One last question.

13:02.936 --> 13:05.503
Do either of these
two people look familiar to you?

13:05.505 --> 13:08.206
The boy looks familiar.

13:08.208 --> 13:10.508
The girl I never seen.

13:10.510 --> 13:11.976
Well, thank you
for your time.

13:11.978 --> 13:14.312
Would you mind
if we came back a little later?

13:14.314 --> 13:17.315
Oh, anytime.
Got nothin' to hide.

13:17.317 --> 13:18.983
Reid: Thanks.

13:22.521 --> 13:25.557
Sorry I couldn't
help you none.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.901
You told the police
you spoke to Abby

13:36.903 --> 13:38.703
the night before she died.

13:38.705 --> 13:40.472
She called
out of the blue,

13:40.474 --> 13:42.540
so I knew
something was up.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.576
You two didn't talk
regularly?

13:44.578 --> 13:46.144
We had...

13:46.146 --> 13:48.747
Different lives.

13:48.749 --> 13:50.215
I went to church,

13:50.217 --> 13:52.650
married the guy
I went to prom with,

13:52.652 --> 13:54.085
had a kid.

13:54.087 --> 13:56.755
And she...

13:56.757 --> 13:58.723
Did what she did.

13:58.725 --> 14:02.994
And what did she call about
two nights ago?

14:02.996 --> 14:04.929
It was hard to follow her.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.798
She was high.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.300
And when she got high,
she got paranoid.

14:09.302 --> 14:11.002
About what?

14:11.004 --> 14:12.670
Cameras in
the light sockets,

14:12.672 --> 14:14.606
black helicopters
following her.

14:14.608 --> 14:17.208
Those are common
drug-induced delusions.

14:17.210 --> 14:18.943
I know. But...

14:18.945 --> 14:23.381
She did something
different on the last call.

14:26.719 --> 14:28.987
She apologized.

14:28.989 --> 14:31.122
For what?

14:31.124 --> 14:33.358
Everything.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.160
Every mistake
she ever made,

14:35.162 --> 14:38.530
every sleepless night that she put
my parents through.

14:38.532 --> 14:40.698
And she said she had
to say these things

14:40.700 --> 14:44.536
because this
was her last...

14:44.538 --> 14:47.739
This was her last chance
to set things right,

14:47.741 --> 14:51.810
because they
were comin' to get her.

14:52.711 --> 14:55.747
We got one of the names
of her clients,

14:55.749 --> 14:57.215
Mack the Knife.

14:57.217 --> 14:59.918
Considering everything
that happened to her,

14:59.920 --> 15:01.486
did she mention--

15:01.488 --> 15:02.554
no. Uh-uh.

15:02.556 --> 15:04.656
It wasn't "he's"
coming to get me,

15:04.658 --> 15:07.125
it's "they" were
coming to get me.

15:09.829 --> 15:12.163
Could we be looking
at a team doing this?

15:12.165 --> 15:14.132
The signature
of the cutting is too specific.

15:14.134 --> 15:16.835
And nothing about
the crime scene indicates a partner.

15:16.837 --> 15:19.604
There is a fear
plaguing this community,

15:19.606 --> 15:21.472
seeping into their souls,
making them meek.

15:21.474 --> 15:23.875
Well, aren't the meek
inheriting the earth, preacher?

15:23.877 --> 15:25.777
Yes, but not until
their time.

15:25.779 --> 15:28.713
Agent Jareau,
SSA Hotchner,

15:28.715 --> 15:30.048
I'd like you to meet
preacher Mills.

15:30.050 --> 15:31.249
He runs the local--

15:31.251 --> 15:32.684
Ministry.

15:32.686 --> 15:34.819
If you're in town long,
you should come hear his word.

15:34.821 --> 15:36.020
Oh, thank you.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.489
Preacher has some information
that he thinks

15:38.491 --> 15:39.824
might help the case.

15:39.826 --> 15:42.660
It's about Lucas Wagner,
the male victim.

15:45.030 --> 15:48.066
My congregation started
as a thought, or--

15:48.068 --> 15:49.801
or rather a dream.

15:49.803 --> 15:52.203
I imagined a place
where everyone could come

15:52.205 --> 15:54.706
to hear the truth
without being judged,

15:54.708 --> 15:56.207
and I--I didn't care
whether you subscribed

15:56.209 --> 15:57.742
to the old testament
or the new testament.

15:57.744 --> 16:01.079
All that I required was that
there was love in your heart.

16:01.081 --> 16:02.881
That's noble.

16:03.883 --> 16:07.151
Look, I neither judge
nor devalue.

16:07.153 --> 16:11.022
I embrace. And when
I hug my flock...

16:11.024 --> 16:12.156
They whisper.

16:12.158 --> 16:13.825
Hotch:
What do they whisper?

16:13.827 --> 16:16.160
Secrets. They tell me
about the things

16:16.162 --> 16:17.595
that are rotting
their souls.

16:17.597 --> 16:20.865
The affairs they've had,
the money they've stolen,

16:20.867 --> 16:23.902
the lascivious thoughts that
permeate their sick minds.

16:23.904 --> 16:25.336
Did Lucas Wagner
have secrets?

16:25.338 --> 16:26.304
Yes.

16:26.306 --> 16:29.374
And it weighs heavily
on my heart.

16:29.376 --> 16:32.076
See, his daddy lost his job.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.379
His mama took gravely ill.

16:34.381 --> 16:36.614
So in order to help out,

16:36.616 --> 16:39.517
he took to the streets...

16:39.519 --> 16:42.086
With the other girls,
so to speak.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.656
Lucas was a male
prostitute.

16:44.658 --> 16:46.524
And he didn't discriminate
with his clientele.

16:46.526 --> 16:48.393
Then why was he arrested
for solicitation?

16:48.395 --> 16:49.861
The judge liked his parents.

16:49.863 --> 16:52.797
He wanted to save them
the embarrassment.

16:52.799 --> 16:56.167
You see, we walk through life
pretending to be one thing

16:56.169 --> 16:57.902
when we're really another.

16:57.904 --> 17:01.272
And like the opposing sides,
truth is a magnet

17:01.274 --> 17:03.541
and it sticks to you.

17:03.543 --> 17:06.810
There's no steering clear
of his law.

17:06.813 --> 17:08.813
Have you by any chance
heard a whisper

17:08.815 --> 17:10.748
about Mack the Knife?

17:10.750 --> 17:14.919
No, that name
means nothing to me.

17:16.155 --> 17:19.490
Ok. Well, thank you.
That info is very helpful.

17:19.492 --> 17:23.661
You know, I had to counsel
Lucas' mother.

17:23.663 --> 17:25.329
She felt terrible guilt
about his death,

17:25.332 --> 17:29.434
and she said his wounds
ran very deep.

17:29.436 --> 17:31.436
Indeed, they did.

17:31.438 --> 17:33.438
Can you tell me
what they look like?

17:33.440 --> 17:35.673
Only that they
were very deep.

17:35.675 --> 17:38.142
If you hear anything
that may pertain to the case,

17:38.144 --> 17:39.877
we'd appreciate it
if you'd let us know.

17:39.879 --> 17:41.179
Of course.

17:41.181 --> 17:45.216
If we can't find
the answers, trust me...

17:45.218 --> 17:47.852
He will.

17:50.756 --> 17:54.459
Look, if we get any breaks,
I promise I will call you.

17:54.461 --> 17:55.994
Preacher.
Carrie.

17:55.996 --> 17:57.996
I heard what happened.

17:57.998 --> 18:01.165
If you need to talk,
my door's always open.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.334
God bless.

18:03.336 --> 18:05.336
God bless.

18:09.641 --> 18:13.778
The cuts on the back
run underneath the scapula.

18:13.780 --> 18:15.279
What kind of knife
did he use?

18:15.281 --> 18:17.115
Sharp one.

18:20.019 --> 18:21.986
Well, we've ruled out rape,

18:21.988 --> 18:25.390
but you still needed
to run a rape kit on her.

18:25.392 --> 18:26.791
Why didn't you?

18:26.793 --> 18:29.527
She was a hooker.
This was easy math.

18:29.529 --> 18:30.828
Well, how about this?

18:30.830 --> 18:32.196
If this were torture,

18:32.198 --> 18:34.832
the victim would be
flailing about.

18:34.834 --> 18:37.869
You'd see a jagged
cutting pattern as a result.

18:37.871 --> 18:38.836
So?

18:38.838 --> 18:42.140
The marks on
Abigail Jones are clean.

18:42.142 --> 18:43.875
How do you account
for that?

18:43.877 --> 18:45.176
Drugs.

18:45.178 --> 18:47.512
Well, did you find drugs in
the autopsy or tox screen?

18:47.514 --> 18:49.213
Oh, I didn't order
any of that.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.314
Why not?

18:50.316 --> 18:54.052
C.O.D. was a gunshot
wound to the head. Hello.

18:54.987 --> 18:57.355
Doctor, where did you
go to medical school?

18:57.357 --> 19:00.391
Oh, I ain't a doctor.
I was elected to this position.

19:00.393 --> 19:01.692
Ahh.
Ohh.

19:01.694 --> 19:03.528
Democracy in action.

19:03.530 --> 19:06.831
You know, I call up M.E.s
when I need 'em.

19:06.833 --> 19:09.133
Well, then, uh, why don't
you call up the bodies, then,

19:09.135 --> 19:11.969
of Hannah Kelly
and Lucas Wagner for us.

19:11.971 --> 19:15.139
You want to dig up
those bodies?

19:15.141 --> 19:17.642
Why? I'm gonna need
a reason

19:17.644 --> 19:20.144
if I'm gonna
submit the request.

19:20.146 --> 19:21.646
We need to do
the work you didn't do

19:21.648 --> 19:23.481
in the first place
to confirm our theory.

19:23.483 --> 19:25.316
Now that we know
that Lucas Wagner

19:25.318 --> 19:27.718
was a male prostitute,
the unsub's M.O. makes more sense.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.554
This probably
wasn't torture.

19:29.556 --> 19:31.089
Then what was it?

19:31.091 --> 19:34.592
It was consensual S&M
that ended with a gunshot.

19:45.370 --> 19:48.706
Yeah, I'm all good.

19:50.209 --> 19:52.543
Tired. You? [Sighs]

19:58.350 --> 20:00.284
Well, Dinah's
been paid in full,

20:00.286 --> 20:02.920
which means the man
upstairs is happy.

20:02.922 --> 20:04.856
So...

20:06.358 --> 20:10.194
All right, Belinda.
We'll talk tomorrow, ok?

20:10.196 --> 20:11.996
All right.

20:31.783 --> 20:34.252
[Unscrews bottle cap]

20:50.002 --> 20:52.603
I am beautiful.

20:54.840 --> 20:58.042
I am beautiful.

20:59.378 --> 21:02.280
I am...

21:02.282 --> 21:04.649
I am...

21:35.969 --> 21:37.503
All right, guys,

21:37.505 --> 21:39.138
I'll cut the binds

21:39.140 --> 21:41.173
and then we can
let her down carefully.

21:41.175 --> 21:42.608
On 3.

21:42.610 --> 21:44.643
1...2...

21:44.645 --> 21:45.845
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?!

21:45.847 --> 21:47.913
Do not disturb
the crime scene.

21:47.915 --> 21:50.783
Well, we took a bunch of pictures
just like you ordered us to.

21:50.785 --> 21:52.084
I ordered you
not to touch a damn thing.

21:52.086 --> 21:53.586
We need to look
at this crime scene undisturbed.

21:53.588 --> 21:54.954
Do you mind
not standing there?

21:54.956 --> 21:55.955
Thanks.

21:55.957 --> 21:58.190
He's escalated his cuts.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.625
They're not only bigger--

21:59.627 --> 22:01.827
Cutting was done postmortem.
It was the gunshot that killed her.

22:01.829 --> 22:02.928
How can you tell?

22:02.930 --> 22:04.763
Based on the lack
of blood flow and scar tissue.

22:04.765 --> 22:06.098
If she were alive
when this was done,

22:06.100 --> 22:07.800
there would be a lot more
blood on her back.

22:07.802 --> 22:09.201
Which means
this wasn't S&M.

22:09.203 --> 22:10.469
This was symbolic.

22:10.471 --> 22:12.037
Symbolic of what?

22:12.039 --> 22:14.039
We're not sure.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.709
Can you smell that?

22:16.711 --> 22:17.676
Lavender.

22:17.678 --> 22:19.445
That doesn't grow
in these parts.

22:19.447 --> 22:20.679
It's mainly
around her legs.

22:20.681 --> 22:21.981
Why would he do that?

22:21.983 --> 22:23.582
Reid, can you look into it?

22:23.584 --> 22:25.651
We can't trust the coroner
to follow through.

22:25.653 --> 22:27.052
Yeah.

22:27.054 --> 22:29.021
We need to deliver
the profile.

22:30.290 --> 22:32.992
I just don't understand
why this has happened.

22:32.994 --> 22:34.860
You have to trust.

22:34.862 --> 22:36.862
How can I trust?

22:36.864 --> 22:39.565
She was my sister
and now she's dead.

22:39.567 --> 22:42.535
Abigail is in
a safe place now.

22:42.537 --> 22:45.271
How do you know that?

22:45.273 --> 22:47.973
If it's so safe, why aren't any of us
in a hurry to get there?

22:47.975 --> 22:51.644
I understand your doubts,
but you must have faith.

22:51.646 --> 22:54.613
I know that this
is just a path that we're on,

22:54.615 --> 22:57.816
a spiritual journey
in a physical form,

22:57.818 --> 23:00.119
and just because
your sister isn't with us

23:00.121 --> 23:01.820
doesn't mean
she isn't among us.

23:01.822 --> 23:03.522
[Door opens]
They're coming for me!

23:03.524 --> 23:05.524
They're coming for me!

23:05.526 --> 23:07.092
Are you ok, dear?

23:07.094 --> 23:08.494
No, I see them.

23:08.496 --> 23:10.930
I saw someone
watching me last night.

23:10.932 --> 23:11.964
Who?

23:11.966 --> 23:12.998
They.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.099
Them.

23:14.101 --> 23:16.435
They tied her to a tree,
and--

23:16.437 --> 23:18.170
Who? Who you
talking about?

23:18.172 --> 23:21.006
Tabitha.
They killed her,

23:21.008 --> 23:24.810
and now all of the streets
are blocked off.

23:24.812 --> 23:26.145
Is this armageddon?

23:26.147 --> 23:27.513
I don't want to die.

23:27.515 --> 23:30.115
You're not gonna die.
You're gonna stay in my office

23:30.117 --> 23:31.584
where you'll be safe
from his evil wrath.

23:31.586 --> 23:33.219
Where are you going,
preacher?

23:33.221 --> 23:36.088
Well, I'm going
to go to the police.

23:36.090 --> 23:38.757
They need to know
this monster is still out there.

23:38.759 --> 23:40.426
And we need to know
what they're gonna do about it.

23:40.428 --> 23:42.161
Come with me, child.

23:52.239 --> 23:53.639
We believe the unsub
we're looking for

23:53.641 --> 23:55.307
is a white male
in his early 30s.

23:55.309 --> 23:56.809
While his M.O.
is that of a sadist,

23:56.811 --> 23:58.310
we think there's
an underlying pathology

23:58.312 --> 23:59.712
of what we call
a wound collector.

23:59.714 --> 24:00.779
What's that?

24:00.781 --> 24:02.181
A wound collector
is someone who uses

24:02.183 --> 24:04.917
a lifetime of sleights,
grievances, and wrongs

24:04.919 --> 24:06.252
as justification
for violence.

24:06.254 --> 24:07.586
Examples can be
as large-scale as Hitler

24:07.588 --> 24:09.922
scapegoating the Jews
for the holocaust.

24:09.924 --> 24:11.957
Or as common as an abusive
husband blaming his wife

24:11.959 --> 24:13.425
as an excuse to beat her.

24:13.427 --> 24:16.795
This unsub is low key,
almost submissive in public.

24:16.797 --> 24:18.664
He has to be to attract
the prostitutes.

24:18.666 --> 24:22.034
But his real nature will be revealed
in the safety of isolation.

24:22.036 --> 24:24.837
This is the type of man who would
anonymously express himself online

24:24.839 --> 24:28.974
by raging against how these women
are filled with disease and filth,

24:28.976 --> 24:30.309
how they deserve
what's coming to them,

24:30.311 --> 24:31.577
probably to cover
for the rejection

24:31.579 --> 24:33.112
of a woman or spouse
who's wronged him.

24:33.114 --> 24:35.114
JJ: Which means the unsub
probably has a working-class

24:35.116 --> 24:37.116
or part-time job.
It gives him the time

24:37.118 --> 24:38.817
to plan and execute
the murders.

24:38.819 --> 24:40.619
Rossi: He's strong
and good with his hands

24:40.621 --> 24:43.522
and probably drives
a work truck or large vehicle.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.357
Blake: This allows him
to move the bodies

24:45.359 --> 24:47.126
and carry to tools
for posing his victims.

24:47.128 --> 24:49.928
Tabitha Ryerson tells us
he's losing control.

24:49.930 --> 24:52.298
He killed her in her home and then
transported her body to the woods

24:52.300 --> 24:54.099
so he could mutilate her
postmortem.

24:54.101 --> 24:56.368
The public nature
of the display was a message.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.469
To who?

24:57.471 --> 24:58.437
To us.

24:58.439 --> 25:00.105
This is a small town

25:00.107 --> 25:02.141
and he knows the FBI is here
investigating his crimes.

25:02.143 --> 25:03.976
He thinks he showing us
that he's smarter than we are.

25:03.978 --> 25:06.378
He's also showing us
his wounds.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.247
There's part of him that wants us
to stop and punish him

25:08.249 --> 25:09.649
[cell phone ringing]
for his crimes.

25:09.650 --> 25:11.317
Thank you. Excuse me.

25:13.453 --> 25:14.753
Yeah, Garcia.

25:14.755 --> 25:17.089
Sir, I found something odd
in Tabitha Ryerson's records.

25:17.091 --> 25:18.924
It turns out she was quite
the independent contractor.

25:18.926 --> 25:20.592
She accepted credit card
payments.

25:20.594 --> 25:22.695
There's one here
for a new client

25:22.697 --> 25:24.396
she was going to see
for the first time tomorrow.

25:24.398 --> 25:27.366
It's labeled "Mack."
I'm thinking Mack the Knife, maybe.

25:27.368 --> 25:28.867
What's the name
on the credit card?

25:31.104 --> 25:33.539
I'm gonna ask you this
one time.

25:33.541 --> 25:35.140
Did you write on that desk?

25:35.142 --> 25:36.608
I don't know.

25:36.610 --> 25:38.277
I asked you
a yes or no question.

25:38.279 --> 25:40.145
"I don't know"
is not an answer.

25:40.147 --> 25:41.413
[Bell rings]

25:41.415 --> 25:43.782
"I don't know" is for children
of poor character,

25:43.784 --> 25:47.186
who come face to face
with their own failings

25:47.188 --> 25:48.721
as stewards of the community.

25:48.723 --> 25:51.490
Now, yes or no,

25:51.492 --> 25:53.992
did you write that disgusting
message on the desk?!

25:53.994 --> 25:55.160
Blake: Principal McIntyre!

25:55.162 --> 25:56.528
Who are you?

25:56.530 --> 25:59.264
We're with the FBI,
and you need to let that child go

25:59.266 --> 26:00.299
and come with us.

26:00.301 --> 26:01.800
I'm the principal
of this school.

26:01.802 --> 26:03.369
You can't just
walk in here.

26:03.371 --> 26:05.738
Yeah, well, we need to talk
about Mack the Knife.

26:07.507 --> 26:10.743
Look, those women
I had sessions with,

26:10.745 --> 26:13.412
ok, maybe some money
changed hands,

26:13.414 --> 26:15.247
but that was just
for their time.

26:15.249 --> 26:17.149
Yeah, we read
the disclaimers

26:17.151 --> 26:19.918
on those escort
websites, too.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.588
Take us through the different
prostitutes you hired.

26:22.590 --> 26:24.923
Sado-masochism
is not a crime.

26:24.925 --> 26:28.026
It's legal, as long as
I don't have sex with them.

26:28.028 --> 26:29.361
And--and--

26:29.363 --> 26:31.764
and you--and you can't
tell anybody about this.

26:31.766 --> 26:34.733
I'm entitled to my privacy
on this. I have kids.

26:34.735 --> 26:37.035
You're not here because
of the S&M.

26:37.037 --> 26:39.338
You're here because
of the murders.

26:39.340 --> 26:40.472
What murders?

26:40.474 --> 26:43.742
Tabitha Ryerson.

26:43.744 --> 26:46.345
She's dead?

26:46.347 --> 26:49.381
I was gonna meet with her for the
first time tomorrow.

26:51.651 --> 26:53.385
Now it's your turn.

26:53.387 --> 26:55.053
You give us names.

26:55.055 --> 26:57.523
Uh, Hannah Kelly.

26:57.525 --> 27:00.793
Uh, Carol Rodgers,

27:00.795 --> 27:02.661
Abigail Jones.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.930
Abigail's my favorite.

27:04.932 --> 27:07.166
What about the men?

27:08.568 --> 27:10.936
So you know
about that, too?

27:10.938 --> 27:13.172
Mm-hmm. Just assume
we know everything.

27:13.174 --> 27:16.141
That way, things will go
a lot easier for all of us.

27:16.143 --> 27:19.178
Lucas Wagner.
Just him.

27:19.180 --> 27:22.214
Now, they all call you
Mack the Knife.

27:22.216 --> 27:26.118
Do you still have the knife
you used on them?

27:26.120 --> 27:27.486
What do you mean?

27:27.488 --> 27:29.087
Well, you cut them,
didn't you?

27:29.089 --> 27:30.923
No.

27:30.925 --> 27:35.794
You--you don't
understand. This is--

27:35.796 --> 27:38.597
No, I'm not being
threatening, ok?

27:39.766 --> 27:42.935
I just want to show you
what I mean.

27:42.937 --> 27:44.937
You see?

27:44.939 --> 27:46.472
They cut me.

27:46.474 --> 27:48.774
How could it not be him?

27:48.776 --> 27:50.576
He had S&M sessions
with all the victims.

27:50.578 --> 27:53.078
We profiled that this unsub
would be submissive in public

27:53.080 --> 27:55.948
and dominant with the prostitutes,
and McIntyre is the opposite.

27:55.950 --> 27:57.449
He takes the submissive
role in the S&M play

27:57.451 --> 27:58.951
most likely because
he's so dominant

27:58.953 --> 28:01.353
as a principal
at his parochial school.

28:01.355 --> 28:02.955
So we're back to
the starting point.

28:02.957 --> 28:04.523
Our best bet is still
the prostitutes.

28:04.525 --> 28:07.493
Tabitha's death might scare
some of them into talking to us.

28:07.495 --> 28:08.660
Mrs. Lawson?

28:08.662 --> 28:10.128
Did preacher Mills
talk to you?

28:10.130 --> 28:11.563
Not since yesterday.
Why?

28:11.565 --> 28:14.132
We were talking in his church,
and one of the girls,

28:14.134 --> 28:16.268
Belinda, I think,
came in begging for help.

28:16.270 --> 28:18.303
The preacher said he was gonna
tell you what she saw

28:18.305 --> 28:20.706
and get an update on the case,
but he never game back.

28:20.708 --> 28:22.140
When was this?
This morning.

28:22.142 --> 28:23.275
No, we haven't seen him.

28:23.277 --> 28:24.910
What do you mean?
She said the same thing

28:24.912 --> 28:26.478
my sister did.
"They" were coming to get her.

28:26.480 --> 28:27.480
What the hell's going on?

28:27.481 --> 28:28.447
Excuse me
for just a moment.

28:28.449 --> 28:29.882
Guys, I think I know
what the lavender

28:29.884 --> 28:31.250
on Tabitha Ryerson's
legs is about.

28:31.252 --> 28:32.551
Have you ever heard
of spikenard?

28:32.553 --> 28:33.970
Uh, no.
It's perfume.

28:33.995 --> 28:34.936
It's mentioned in the gospel.

28:34.961 --> 28:36.256
It's derived from lavender.

28:36.257 --> 28:37.589
It's what Mary Magdalene
used to wash Jesus' feet,

28:37.591 --> 28:39.091
which tells us that
this unsub's message

28:39.093 --> 28:40.659
is obviously religious
in nature.

28:40.661 --> 28:41.905
Preacher Mills, maybe.

28:41.930 --> 28:43.663
He came forward to
volunteer information.

28:43.664 --> 28:45.931
Well, yesterday he said he'd let us
know if he had any more information,

28:45.933 --> 28:47.266
but apparently
he's changed his mind.

28:47.268 --> 28:48.901
He fits the profile.

28:48.903 --> 28:51.136
He's morally rigorous,
submissive in public.

28:51.138 --> 28:53.839
So we'll put an APB
out for him.

28:55.174 --> 28:57.042

28:59.512 --> 29:00.812
Where's Dinah?!

29:00.814 --> 29:02.881
Check the back, padre.

29:04.050 --> 29:08.220

if you're interested.

29:10.857 --> 29:12.324
Dinah.

29:12.326 --> 29:13.759
What's goin' on,
preach?

29:13.761 --> 29:15.060
Ohh!

29:15.062 --> 29:17.129
The man upstairs
wants answers.

29:17.131 --> 29:18.860
If you can't make sure
my bitches are safe,

29:18.885 --> 29:20.199
then what good are you?

29:20.200 --> 29:22.534
I don't know
who's hurtin' 'em.

29:22.536 --> 29:23.735
Well, figure it out.

29:23.737 --> 29:25.771
Unless you want
to join them.

29:25.773 --> 29:27.072
[Gasps]

29:41.200 --> 29:44.202
I haven't seen the preacher
since this morning.

29:44.204 --> 29:46.872
He was talking
to one of those girls.

29:46.874 --> 29:48.573
Do you know
if she's still here?

29:48.575 --> 29:50.242
I think she slipped out.

29:50.244 --> 29:52.043
Her name was Belinda.

29:52.045 --> 29:53.779
Do you mind
if we check the back?

29:53.781 --> 29:55.380
Oh, no.

30:00.686 --> 30:02.220
Well, I don't get it.

30:02.222 --> 30:04.389
If the preacher had
something to do with it,

30:04.391 --> 30:05.791
then why was
he so helpful?

30:05.793 --> 30:08.860
Unsubs insert themselves
into investigations all the time.

30:08.862 --> 30:11.530
They enjoy the power and the feeling
that they're smarter than us.

30:11.532 --> 30:12.843
And to keep tabs on the case.

30:12.868 --> 30:14.908
He wanted to know how close
we were to catching him.

30:14.935 --> 30:16.401
[Cell phone rings]

30:16.403 --> 30:17.736
Go ahead, Garcia.

30:17.738 --> 30:20.906
Sir, I got the backhoe going into this
not-so-clean preacher.

30:20.908 --> 30:23.375
I haven't found his present
whereabouts yet,

30:23.377 --> 30:25.677
but I'm looking at his bank account.
I can tell you

30:25.679 --> 30:28.413
he doesn't adhere to the
"give all your money to the poor" model.

30:28.415 --> 30:30.382
Any idea where
the money's coming from?

30:30.384 --> 30:31.917
Not yet.
But it's mostly cash,

30:31.919 --> 30:34.019
and we're talking
6 figures big.

30:34.021 --> 30:36.822
You know, maybe
it's sex trafficking.

30:36.824 --> 30:40.559
This unsub is able to get prostitutes
to let their guard down.

30:40.561 --> 30:41.760
They're somebody he knows.

30:41.762 --> 30:44.095
I thought you said
our killer was a john.

30:44.097 --> 30:46.097
Prostitutes would rat out
a john or kill him themselves,

30:46.099 --> 30:47.899
but they would never
go against their own pimp.

30:47.901 --> 30:49.768
Garcia, take everything
we know about Mills

30:49.770 --> 30:51.803
and run it up against pandering
and procuring charges.

30:51.805 --> 30:53.171
This isn't the first time
he's done this.

30:53.173 --> 30:54.306
You got it.

30:54.308 --> 30:55.473
I swear to God,

30:55.475 --> 30:56.775
I don't know
who's doing this.

30:56.777 --> 30:59.611
All I ask is you keep
my property clean.

30:59.613 --> 31:02.047
No diseases, no drugs,
and you collect my money.

31:02.049 --> 31:05.016
Now, which John likes to beat them?
Who likes to get rough?

31:05.018 --> 31:07.018
I don't know!

31:07.020 --> 31:09.321
Who likes to tie them down?
'Cause that's who's doing this!

31:09.323 --> 31:10.755
Ohh!

31:10.757 --> 31:12.591
Ok. Ok.

31:12.593 --> 31:13.725
Ok.

31:13.727 --> 31:16.061
There's the guys
over in Oakwood

31:16.063 --> 31:18.029
who can get
a little freaky.

31:18.031 --> 31:20.298
Stop! Stop! Stop.

31:20.300 --> 31:21.399
Stop.

31:21.401 --> 31:23.768
And then there's Mike,
our mechanic.

31:23.770 --> 31:25.737
I mean, he had Tabitha
bleeding once.

31:25.739 --> 31:28.840
Mike's so fat, he gets winded
hoisting a damn hot dog.

31:28.842 --> 31:30.942
He couldn't tie her
to a tree!

31:30.944 --> 31:33.144
And then there's
Travis, the druggie.

31:33.146 --> 31:36.481
Yeah. Yeah, he snitches
to the cops for quick fixes.

31:36.483 --> 31:38.483
Yeah, and he cut
Belinda once.

31:38.485 --> 31:41.620
I mean, he could've
made the wounds on the girls.

31:41.622 --> 31:43.321
You know what these
wounds look like?

31:43.323 --> 31:45.991
I heard from one of
the girls at the station

31:45.993 --> 31:48.293
that they were
kind of criss-cross.

31:48.295 --> 31:51.630
I mean, Travis
could have done that.

31:51.632 --> 31:53.131
[Gasps]

31:53.133 --> 31:56.034
What else have you heard?

31:56.036 --> 31:57.836
The Feds are looking
for someone

31:57.838 --> 31:59.871
who wants to clean up
the streets.

32:02.275 --> 32:06.177
It is time to pay
the butcher a visit.

32:06.179 --> 32:08.880
Well, Travis lives
near Rodgers Park,

32:08.882 --> 32:13.151
but he does coke
in that house on Dunbar.

32:14.520 --> 32:16.855
Did you know the charge
of being a pimp, when gussied up,

32:16.857 --> 32:20.125
is "procuring and pandering"?
And Hotch was right.

32:20.127 --> 32:23.028
Preacher Mills is familiar
with this charge.

32:23.030 --> 32:25.463
Because before he was Justin Mills,
he was Gordon Borell,

32:25.465 --> 32:27.599
and he was arrested for cutting
one of the ladies he employed.

32:27.601 --> 32:29.134
Rossi: Where did he cut her?

32:29.136 --> 32:32.070
On the back.
When questioned, she said--

32:32.072 --> 32:34.439
oh, I'm gonna have to look
at kitten videos after this--

32:34.441 --> 32:37.242
he was marking his property.

32:37.244 --> 32:38.209
You're kidding.

32:38.211 --> 32:39.577
That's why he
specifically asked me

32:39.579 --> 32:41.012
about the wounds
on Lucas Wagner.

32:41.014 --> 32:42.414
He knew we'd find out
about his past.

32:42.416 --> 32:44.182
Why didn't we turn this up
before now?

32:44.184 --> 32:46.217
Because he changed his name
when he crossed the border.

32:46.219 --> 32:47.786
The northern border
to be exact.

32:47.788 --> 32:51.256
Mr. Mills, nee Borell,
is from Tees, Alberta.

32:51.258 --> 32:52.757
I'll tell you what.
Those Canadians,

32:52.759 --> 32:54.259
the seem so sweet
and innocent,

32:54.261 --> 32:57.028
but when they go bad,
they go Darth Vader bad.

32:57.030 --> 32:58.763
So he came here
to start over,

32:58.765 --> 33:00.265
took on the mantle
of the collar

33:00.267 --> 33:02.167
as the perfect cover
for the sex trade.

33:02.169 --> 33:04.502
No one in this town
would question a man of God.

33:04.504 --> 33:06.271
But now we got the smoking gun
we need on this guy.

33:06.273 --> 33:08.406
Garcia, was there
an attempted murder charge?

33:08.408 --> 33:10.375
No. In fact, she said
he wanted her to go back out

33:10.377 --> 33:12.077
and start working
when he was done cutting her.

33:12.079 --> 33:14.279
He's not our unsub.

33:38.504 --> 33:40.839
Go, go.

33:44.343 --> 33:46.177
Travis.

33:48.647 --> 33:50.815
[Grunting] No. No, no.

33:50.817 --> 33:54.019
Word is you're quite skilled
with a knife, Travis. Huh?!

33:54.021 --> 33:55.353
Are you framin' me?

33:55.355 --> 33:57.522
No, man.

33:57.524 --> 33:59.224
Uhh!

33:59.226 --> 34:01.926
You tell me the truth,
you son of a bitch.

34:01.928 --> 34:04.229
I--I didn't do--
I didn't do it.

34:04.231 --> 34:06.197
Then who is?!
Someone's trying to make this

34:06.199 --> 34:07.732
look like my handiwork.

34:07.734 --> 34:10.635
You tell them
to make themselves known

34:10.637 --> 34:12.103
or I damn sure will.

34:12.105 --> 34:15.206
Ok. [Gasping]

34:15.208 --> 34:18.376
What do you
want me to do?

34:18.378 --> 34:21.312
Work a miracle.

34:23.882 --> 34:26.217
This guy fits to a "T".

34:26.219 --> 34:27.552
How can we rule him out?

34:27.554 --> 34:30.422
Criminally, pimps follow
the same behavioral pattern

34:30.424 --> 34:31.656
as drug dealers.

34:31.658 --> 34:33.391
Prostitutes
are his revenue stream.

34:33.393 --> 34:35.527
He would only kill them
as a last resort.

34:35.529 --> 34:38.429
Which is why the cutting in Canada
was a punishment,

34:38.431 --> 34:39.731
not a religious
punishment,

34:39.733 --> 34:41.266
but a punishment for
not doing their jobs.

34:41.268 --> 34:43.902
Then he comes here
to start over, set up a new shop.

34:43.904 --> 34:45.904
And that's when somebody
found out about his past,

34:45.906 --> 34:47.806
used it as a forensic countermeasure
to throw us off track

34:47.808 --> 34:49.206
by framing him.

34:49.208 --> 34:51.576
That's why the girls
kept saying, "they're" after us.

34:51.578 --> 34:53.078
There wasn't a team of unsubs,
but one sadist

34:53.080 --> 34:54.579
copying the behavior
of another.

34:54.581 --> 34:56.114
It would also explain
the change with Tabitha,

34:56.116 --> 34:57.949
the escalation,
the perfume on the feet.

34:57.951 --> 35:01.119
But you said the unsub wanted us
to catch him and punish him.

35:01.121 --> 35:04.522
What he really wanted
was for us to catch the preacher.

35:04.524 --> 35:06.491
So whoever this guy is,
he's fooled all of us,

35:06.493 --> 35:08.660
and now we got nothin'
when it comes to the profile.

35:08.662 --> 35:10.895
No, that's not true.
The unsub chose Mills for a reason,

35:10.897 --> 35:12.964
and Mills can still
lead us to the unsub.

35:12.966 --> 35:16.401
We'll have agent Morgan
and the deputies start at his house.

35:22.074 --> 35:24.175
[Sniffing]

35:24.177 --> 35:25.743
[Coughs]

35:25.745 --> 35:29.280
[Cell phone rings]

35:29.282 --> 35:30.381
What?!

35:30.383 --> 35:31.749
Travis: I got the guy
who did it.

35:31.751 --> 35:32.917
Good boy.

35:32.919 --> 35:34.319
Is it one of them?

35:34.321 --> 35:35.353
Yeah.

35:35.355 --> 35:37.355
And I even got the gun
he used to kill them.

35:37.357 --> 35:39.090
All right.
Where can we meet.

35:39.092 --> 35:42.127
Regular place,
two hours?

35:45.231 --> 35:46.898
I did what you said.

35:46.900 --> 35:48.066
Yes, you did.

35:48.068 --> 35:50.568
That's a good job, too.
I almost believed you.

35:50.570 --> 35:52.237
Come on, man,
give me the stuff.

35:52.239 --> 35:54.572
Oh, right. Here you go.

35:54.574 --> 35:56.174
No, no!

36:29.314 --> 36:30.904
We just went through
the preacher's house.

36:30.929 --> 36:32.250
No one's in there.

36:32.251 --> 36:34.785
But I did find cocaine
in a hidden compartment.

36:34.787 --> 36:36.587
How much?

36:36.589 --> 36:37.955
A kilo.
With that amount,

36:37.957 --> 36:39.523
he's not just using it,
he's selling it, too.

36:39.525 --> 36:41.358
If that's the case,
then the suspect pool

36:41.360 --> 36:42.826
of whoever's framing him
just got a lot bigger.

36:42.828 --> 36:46.563
Well, JJ's headed to the bar to see
if Dinah's seen him.

36:46.565 --> 36:49.600
Dinah left about an hour ago.

36:49.602 --> 36:51.568
Was she with
the preacher?

36:55.640 --> 36:58.976
He was here earlier,
Dinah and him were talking,

36:58.978 --> 37:00.544
and then he left
all in a huff.

37:00.546 --> 37:01.945
Do you know where
he was going?

37:01.947 --> 37:05.516
Didn't ask.
He was too pissed off.

37:05.518 --> 37:07.684
All right. Thanks.

37:11.289 --> 37:12.289
Hey, Hotch.

37:12.291 --> 37:13.290
Any luck?

37:13.292 --> 37:14.324
He's not here either.

37:14.326 --> 37:15.759
I've got roadblocks
on ever corner

37:15.761 --> 37:17.161
in an out of town.
He won't get far.

37:17.162 --> 37:19.496
JJ, help canvass the area.
We'll dig deeper here

37:19.498 --> 37:21.532
and see if we can figure out
where he's going.

37:21.534 --> 37:22.866
All right.

37:22.868 --> 37:27.704
[Line ringing]

37:29.507 --> 37:32.376
Voicemail: Yo, this is Travis.
Leave it after the beep.

37:32.378 --> 37:34.244
[Beep] What--

37:35.747 --> 37:37.347
Where are you?

37:37.349 --> 37:38.949
I don't see your car here.

37:38.951 --> 37:41.552
We said 8:00. Hurry up.

37:44.689 --> 37:46.823
[Sniffing]

37:54.699 --> 37:56.366
Sheriff, be advised.
I've got the suspect

37:56.368 --> 37:58.535
headed into
el Lobito's diner.

37:58.537 --> 38:02.039
Repeat, I've got the suspect
headed into el Lobito's diner.

38:02.041 --> 38:03.574
Copy, deputy.
We're on our way.

38:03.576 --> 38:04.841
We got him.

38:04.843 --> 38:06.276
All right, Blake, you and Reid
go with the sheriff.

38:06.278 --> 38:08.345
Dave and I will coordinate
the response here.

38:40.545 --> 38:44.214
[Cell phone rings]

38:44.216 --> 38:47.651
[Ring]

38:47.653 --> 38:49.186
[Ring]

38:49.188 --> 38:50.520
The preacher's
not answering.

38:50.522 --> 38:52.022
Keep trying.
We need to tell him

38:52.024 --> 38:55.092
we know he didn't do this.

38:55.094 --> 38:58.095
[Cell phone ringing]

39:02.900 --> 39:04.034
Yeah.

39:04.036 --> 39:06.970
Oh, preacher, what have you
gotten yourself into?

39:06.972 --> 39:08.505
I didn't do
any of this.

39:08.507 --> 39:09.806
You did this to me.

39:09.808 --> 39:11.475
Is that what you're
gonna tell the feds?

39:11.477 --> 39:12.976
Who, incidentally,
are on their way.

39:12.978 --> 39:14.845
You think they're gonna
believe a pimp like you?

39:14.847 --> 39:17.414
Sorry. A preacher like you?

39:17.416 --> 39:18.815
We had a deal.

39:18.817 --> 39:21.184
Yes, we did,
but the deal's changed.

39:21.186 --> 39:22.519
I helped you!

39:22.521 --> 39:24.655
And I'm helping you.

39:24.657 --> 39:26.323
I didn't leave you
empty-handed.

39:26.325 --> 39:28.225
You got yourself
a fighting chance.

39:28.227 --> 39:29.826
[Sirens]
Oh, you hear those sirens?

39:29.828 --> 39:31.862
Tick tock, preacher,
tick tock.

39:34.032 --> 39:35.999
I will destroy you.

39:36.001 --> 39:37.501
In heaven or in hell?

39:37.503 --> 39:39.770
Which one are you
gonna go to, huh?

39:39.772 --> 39:41.505
You got anything you want
to get off your chest,

39:41.507 --> 39:44.708
because the hour of reckoning
is upon you, preacher man.

39:44.710 --> 39:46.343
You son of a bitch.

39:46.345 --> 39:49.880
Next time you tell your whores
to keep their mouths shut.

39:49.882 --> 39:51.782
Good luck.

39:51.784 --> 39:54.451
[Sirens]

40:01.926 --> 40:03.560
He's been in there
a good 5 minutes now.

40:03.562 --> 40:05.662
I haven't seen
any movement yet.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.230
What about patrons?
Uh, it's closed.

40:07.232 --> 40:09.366
How many entrances?
Two, it looks like.

40:09.368 --> 40:11.034
The question is,
is he alone?

40:25.249 --> 40:27.250
Guys, I've got movement.

40:27.252 --> 40:28.685
We should move in now,
sheriff.

40:28.687 --> 40:30.687
Actually, we're better off
establishing the perimeter first.

40:30.689 --> 40:32.622
Then we can open up
a line of communication.

40:32.624 --> 40:34.357
All right, agreed.
We need to get around--
