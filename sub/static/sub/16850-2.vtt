(female narrator)
Previously
on Childrens Hospital.

00:03.237 --> 00:04.738
Well, your daughter
has 20-20 vision.

00:04.805 --> 00:07.941
But it's actually your eyes
I'm concerned about.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.943
What shade of awesome
are those things

00:10.010 --> 00:12.146
because I am drowning, girl.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.782
See this mark
on the ulterior colon.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.918
It moves here,
then here.

00:17.985 --> 00:19.353
- Are you trying to--
- Yes.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.821
This poop-shoe is Honten.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.390
[laughing]

00:22.456 --> 00:25.959
(Cat)
'My best friend, Dr. Lola Spratt
is dead.'

00:26.026 --> 00:28.129
I want a dinosaur doctor.

00:28.196 --> 00:31.165
(male #1)
'He's got the rarest case
of advanced aging disease'

00:31.232 --> 00:33.101
'I've ever seen.'

00:33.167 --> 00:34.868
You had sex with my son?

00:34.935 --> 00:37.705
You prefer, I have sex
near your son or above him?

00:37.771 --> 00:39.940
My private practice
went out of business today.

00:40.007 --> 00:44.378
It's okay, I'm...sure Childrens
Hospital will take me back.

00:45.313 --> 00:48.316
[theme music]

00:51.652 --> 00:53.121
The end.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.689
Soon it will be the end.
But not yet.

00:55.756 --> 00:59.227
Hey...aren't you Cat's
boyfriend's mother?

00:59.293 --> 01:02.896
Yeah, I was. After he died,
I got a job here as a nurse.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.132
He died?

01:04.197 --> 01:05.899
[screaming]

01:05.966 --> 01:07.735
(male #2)
The baby is coming fast.

01:07.801 --> 01:09.637
Cat!

01:09.703 --> 01:12.506
(Cat)
Right now, it's the opposite
of the end.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.575
[groaning]

01:14.642 --> 01:17.678
The actual end begins
about a week ago.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.947
My boyfriend Nicky's advanced
aging disease is getting worse.

01:20.013 --> 01:22.650
Disease is getting worse.
Is he staying active?

01:22.716 --> 01:25.586
I play mahjong every morning
with the girls at the home.

01:25.653 --> 01:30.057
And on Tuesdays, there's
a live one man band. Haicha!

01:30.124 --> 01:32.193
Nicky's dementia
is getting worse too.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.195
It's hard to tell
what's senility

01:34.262 --> 01:36.297
and what's normal
six-year-old behavior.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.166
Plus I think he's
a little retarded.

01:38.232 --> 01:40.401
So, let's just call
a spade a spade, okay.

01:40.468 --> 01:43.671
I'm only doing this so that
we can have a little privacy.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.473
I can read lips.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.176
I hear that you're considering
not keeping the baby.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.778
I hear that you're
a crazy cat lady.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.813
Nicky's in no condition
to give me support

01:52.880 --> 01:54.648
and what if the disease
is hereditary?

01:54.715 --> 01:57.451
- That makes good sense.
- Hats make good tents.

01:57.518 --> 02:00.020
This whole confusing confusion
about whether to keep the baby

02:00.087 --> 02:01.722
or not has me so confused.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.692
Cat! You have to stop
thinking about yourself.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.994
You have to think
about Nicky, right now.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.630
He is in pain.
Nicky will die very soon.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.800
Cat! You have to
stop tickling on the shelf.

02:12.866 --> 02:16.404
You have to start thinking
about sticky-icky-icky now.

02:16.470 --> 02:20.007
The rain in Spain.
Nicky will die very soon.

02:20.073 --> 02:22.176
Wait, what!
Hold on.

02:22.243 --> 02:25.145
Come here.
Come here.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.182
Wait, what're you doing?

02:28.249 --> 02:31.018
Well, sorry. Didn't you
and Lola have a thing?

02:31.084 --> 02:33.554
(Nicky)
'Didn't Nebola
have a rin-tin-tin?'

02:33.621 --> 02:35.956
(thinking)
"Didn't you and Lola
have a thing?"

02:36.023 --> 02:37.191
[laughing]

02:37.258 --> 02:38.926
Oh!

02:38.992 --> 02:44.632
* I know the distance it takes
to sail around the world *

02:44.698 --> 02:49.803
"Didn't nebola have
rin-tin-tin?"

02:49.870 --> 02:51.605
No.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.973
Lola is dead.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.875
[scoffs]
That's not what I hear.

02:54.942 --> 02:58.746
I hear her ghost still haunts
the old haunted locker room.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.881
[melancholic music]

03:00.948 --> 03:04.818
I know you're here, Lola.
Reveal your spirit to me.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.457
Man, this locker room
isn't haunted.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.058
"Brazil's most haunted
locker rooms."

03:11.124 --> 03:14.662
It's the last time I go to that
half price book store.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.697
That's for sure.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.198
Goodbye, Lola.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.301
- Hello, Owen.
- Ah!

03:20.368 --> 03:22.670
- G-g-g-ghost!
- No, I'm not a ghost.

03:22.736 --> 03:26.240
Well, then how come I can
put my hand right through you?

03:29.243 --> 03:30.978
Okay, alright, alright,
alright, alright.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.946
Owen, stop it.
I'm not a ghost.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.548
I faked my own death.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.485
This is exactly what the ancient
scroll said you would say.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.853
I'm gonna announce my return
at the staff meeting.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.691
It's gonna be awesome.
Oh, I can't wait. I'm restless.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.394
I've always wanted to have sex
with a restless spirit.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.496
Take off your ghost clothes.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.032
Ah!
G-g-g-ghost!

03:52.099 --> 03:55.503
(female on speaker)
'Attention, staff. There has to
be more to life than..

03:55.569 --> 04:00.841
'Lastly, I'm happy to announce
that as a result of my surgery'

04:00.908 --> 04:03.711
not only have I been made
even more gorgeous

04:03.777 --> 04:07.448
but I no longer need
these crutches.

04:08.782 --> 04:09.983
Good riddance.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.251
[applause]

04:11.319 --> 04:13.220
Check it out people. Woo!

04:13.287 --> 04:15.589
Yeah, it's like I'm flying.

04:15.656 --> 04:20.293
I would like to announce that
Lola is back from the grave.

04:20.361 --> 04:23.063
Reveal yourself, ghost.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.698
[screaming]

04:24.765 --> 04:26.467
G-g-g-ghost!

04:29.470 --> 04:31.772
[gasping]

04:33.974 --> 04:35.376
Oh! Oh, god!
Ah!

04:35.443 --> 04:38.145
- Ow, ow!
- Ah!

04:38.211 --> 04:39.613
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh! Ow!

04:39.680 --> 04:42.282
Ghost, tell us,
is rain really God's tears?

04:42.350 --> 04:44.452
'Why does it rain
in Seattle, never LA?'

04:44.518 --> 04:46.687
Waitin' my fall,
you sexy son of a bitch.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.523
- Ghost, I wanna talk to you.
- I am not a ghost.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.559
If you're not a ghost
then prove it.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.226
- How?
- Pee on me.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.895
What? How does that prove?

04:54.962 --> 04:57.698
I've been peed on many times.
I'll feel the difference.

04:57.765 --> 05:00.501
Is it really so crazy
that I faked my own death

05:00.568 --> 05:02.570
because I had
too many e-mails?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.972
God! It was horrible!

05:08.409 --> 05:10.344
I get it now.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.413
You're here to take
Cat's dying retarded boyfriend

05:12.480 --> 05:13.814
to the other side.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.816
Oh, my god!

05:15.883 --> 05:17.284
Ah!

05:17.351 --> 05:19.319
'So, what do you wanna read
tonight?'

05:19.387 --> 05:21.121
I wanna read
the ancient scrolls.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.690
- Again?
- 'Mm-hmm.'

05:22.756 --> 05:24.024
Okay.

05:24.091 --> 05:27.395
Uh-oh. I forgot to take
my pills for my ticker.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.962
Okay.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.664
Wait, what's this?

05:30.731 --> 05:32.700
This is Viagra.
This is the wrong pill.

05:32.766 --> 05:35.035
This is a direct conflict with
your cholesterol medication.

05:35.102 --> 05:38.105
We have to go to the hospital
or you're gonna die.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.474
My ticker's getting hard.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.145
Oh! You did this for me,
didn't you?

05:45.212 --> 05:49.517
You took the wrong pill so that
we could make love again.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.919
One last time.
Before you died.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.222
Okay.

05:55.288 --> 05:58.992
* Sweet sweet baby *

05:59.059 --> 06:01.795
* I think maybe *

06:03.964 --> 06:09.169
* Maybe you shouldn't leave *

06:09.236 --> 06:13.474
* So baby
Oh baby..*

06:13.541 --> 06:16.276
- 'Did I make?'
- You're about to make.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.446
I feel weird though.

06:18.512 --> 06:22.115
Boy! Oh! Ha!

06:22.182 --> 06:24.552
[slurping]

06:24.618 --> 06:27.254
Oh, my heart
is beating so fast.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.556
Yeah, that's coz
you're feelin'--

06:28.622 --> 06:30.624
Yeah, it's beating
too fast. Ow!

06:30.691 --> 06:33.393
- What?
- I'm dyin' over here.

06:33.461 --> 06:36.296
Oh, god! It's happening so fast!

06:36.363 --> 06:37.631
[telephone ringing]

06:37.698 --> 06:40.300
Oops, I gotta get that.

06:40.367 --> 06:43.671
Hello.
Yeah, I've got time.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.475
Uh, female.
Between the ages of 25 and 35.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.378
Over $150,000 a year.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.614
'Satisfied.
Extremely satisfied.'

06:53.681 --> 06:55.449
I got a fudge in my veins.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.051
'You're welcome. Bye.'

06:59.853 --> 07:01.455
[gasps]

07:01.522 --> 07:04.458
[groaning]

07:04.525 --> 07:07.661
- What?
- I can see my grandma.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.531
- You can?
- And she's not judging anybody.

07:10.598 --> 07:15.035
Shh. Go gentle
into that good light.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.970
[grunts]

07:27.214 --> 07:28.916
[dramatic music]

07:28.982 --> 07:30.751
[groaning]

07:33.286 --> 07:34.788
Oh, alright.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.890
Well, I gotta poop
this kid out.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.025
[screaming]

07:38.091 --> 07:40.861
After he died
I got a job as a nurse.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.863
He died?

07:42.930 --> 07:47.000
(Cat)
This is it. The end that I
was talking about before.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.769
- We're losing her.
- Advanced aging disease.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.204
'It's hereditary.
The baby is too big.'

07:51.271 --> 07:52.906
Her vagina is too small.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.274
Oh, ha, ha!

07:54.341 --> 07:56.677
Oh, Lola.

07:56.744 --> 07:59.446
Are you here
to take me to the other side?

07:59.513 --> 08:01.248
No, I'm not dead.

08:01.314 --> 08:07.154
Can you gift me the kiss
of life if they've saved me.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.756
Cat, I need you to push.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.291
- Oh, Lola!
- Push, damn it.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.893
Ah!

08:13.727 --> 08:16.329
Is it a boy or a girl?

08:16.396 --> 08:17.565
Shh.

08:17.631 --> 08:20.167
[machine beeping]

08:20.233 --> 08:21.569
Ah!

08:22.703 --> 08:25.038
[melancholic music]

08:26.874 --> 08:29.977
(Cat)
Lives end. Just like stories.

08:30.043 --> 08:33.280
Time of death.
10 PM. Nine central.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.616
Our voices stop,
but our stories live on.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.652
'Dr. Cat Black
is gone for good.'

08:38.719 --> 08:41.989
And no one
will ever replace her.

08:42.054 --> 08:45.292
I'm Valarie Flame.
Dr. Cat Black's replacement.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.596
- What can I do?
- O-oh, girl, whatever you want.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.098
Ha-cha-cha!

08:51.164 --> 08:54.034
'Wee-ou-wee-ou-wee.'

08:54.101 --> 08:56.770
[grunting]

08:56.837 --> 08:59.873
- I'll wash the child.
- 'Oh, I got a baby boner.'

08:59.940 --> 09:02.009
'Goodnight, pussycat''

09:02.075 --> 09:03.644
Ha-ha. I'm back.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.413
My private practice
is over. I'm ready to..

09:06.479 --> 09:07.748
Wow!

09:08.949 --> 09:10.117
Oh!

09:10.183 --> 09:11.785
That is horrible.

09:11.852 --> 09:15.555
Ha-ha-ha.
I mean, come on!

09:15.623 --> 09:17.925
'It's like a bomb
went off in that thing.'

09:17.991 --> 09:21.261
Oh, it's like
a Vietnam movie. Wow!

09:22.429 --> 09:24.231
I'm talking about her vagina.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.499
- That's enough.
- Wow!

09:26.566 --> 09:28.535
'You guys
should see this thing.'

09:28.602 --> 09:30.103
(Cat)
And new stories begin.

09:30.170 --> 09:33.841
Life is death and rebirth
and love and blood.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.475
We all have a story to tell.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.678
Some stories
are just better than others.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.980
More interesting and prettier.

09:40.047 --> 09:43.183
Some stories are blonde
with Scandinavian features.

09:45.886 --> 09:49.657
And all stories
come to a beginning, so..

09:49.723 --> 09:52.325
The beginning.

09:52.392 --> 09:53.827
[up-beat music]

09:53.894 --> 09:58.799
* The beginning of the earth *

10:02.970 --> 10:07.941
* It's the beginning
of the earth *

10:12.846 --> 10:14.782
Are you my grandma?

10:14.848 --> 10:16.717
I was. I work here now.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.619
- That's confusing.
- Sorry.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.824
* It's the beginning *

10:23.891 --> 10:26.860
[instrumental music]

10:29.429 --> 10:32.399
I have a real treat
for fans of the show.

10:32.465 --> 10:37.304
I have the actual person
upon whom the character

10:37.370 --> 10:41.374
Dr. Blake Downs, character that
I play in the show was based.

10:41.441 --> 10:45.612
So, um, without further ado,
the real Dr. Blake Downs.

10:45.679 --> 10:48.048
Dr. Blake Downs.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.217
[clapping]

10:52.452 --> 10:54.187
