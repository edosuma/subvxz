00:06.072 --> 00:07.573
<i>he fools around with other women</i>

00:07.574 --> 00:09.074

00:09.075 --> 00:11.076
<i>Mary convinced Jodie</i>

00:11.077 --> 00:12.077
<i>and that way,</i>

00:12.078 --> 00:13.579
<i>he could get help with the baby.</i>

00:13.580 --> 00:15.581
<i>Danny met a girl named Polly</i>
<i>at the cemetery</i>

00:15.582 --> 00:17.583

00:17.584 --> 00:19.084

01:19.145 --> 01:21.146
Okay, listen,
I think you should take

01:21.147 --> 01:22.147
the bottom drawers
in the bureau,

01:22.148 --> 01:23.148
because you're shorter,

01:23.149 --> 01:24.650
and I'll take
the back of the closet,

01:24.651 --> 01:25.651
because my arms are longer.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.152
Are you sure it's all right?

01:27.153 --> 01:31.156
Well, there's not much
I can do about it now.

01:31.157 --> 01:33.158
Must be from all those chin-ups.

01:33.159 --> 01:34.159
No, no, Danny,

01:34.160 --> 01:36.161
I mean about
moving in here with you.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.663
I mean, after all,
this is your room.

01:37.664 --> 01:39.164
Are you kidding me?

01:39.165 --> 01:41.166
My little brother
is moving back home.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.168
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

01:43.169 --> 01:45.170
I can't believe I'm back.

01:45.171 --> 01:47.172
It took me all those years
to move out,

01:47.173 --> 01:48.674
but it will make life
a little easier.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.176
I can go back to work,
and I'll know Wendy's okay.

01:51.177 --> 01:52.177
Hey, listen, uh,

01:52.178 --> 01:54.179
you want the, uh, lumpy mattress

01:54.180 --> 01:55.681
or the springy mattress?

01:55.682 --> 01:56.682
Springy, if it's okay.

01:56.683 --> 01:59.685
It's cool. I like lumpy.

01:59.686 --> 02:00.686
Makes me feel

02:00.687 --> 02:02.689
like there's someone
in here with me.

02:05.191 --> 02:07.693
You know, I remember
when we shared a bedroom as kids

02:07.694 --> 02:09.695
in the old house.

02:09.696 --> 02:10.696
Yeah.

02:10.697 --> 02:14.199
You told me my first dirty joke.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.203
Yeah, and you didn't get it.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.205
You were so innocent.

02:20.206 --> 02:22.208
I was 4.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.711
Hey, listen,
I got a surprise for you.

02:25.712 --> 02:28.715
This is a real blast
from the past.

02:30.216 --> 02:31.717
Ta-dah!

02:31.718 --> 02:33.218
The hoop.

02:33.219 --> 02:34.720
Our old basketball hoop.

02:34.721 --> 02:36.722
Wow, you saved it
all these years. Yep.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.223
All right,
a little one-on-one.

02:38.224 --> 02:40.225
Okay.

02:40.226 --> 02:42.728
Two from the floor.
Three from the beds.

02:42.729 --> 02:43.729
Okay. Turn off the TV.

02:43.730 --> 02:44.730
All right.

02:44.731 --> 02:46.231
Aah!
Whoa!

02:47.233 --> 02:48.233
Well, look at this.

02:48.234 --> 02:50.235
It's a meeting of the minds.

02:50.236 --> 02:52.738
Einstein and Dr. Freud.

02:52.739 --> 02:55.240
Stee-rike!

02:55.241 --> 02:56.241
Hey, did you hear?

02:56.242 --> 02:57.242
Jodie's moving back in.

02:57.243 --> 02:58.243
Did I hear?

02:58.244 --> 03:01.246
My room is being
transformed into a nursery.

03:01.247 --> 03:02.748
Did I hear, he says.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.249
Oh, see, the nursery's
for the baby, Bob.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.251
See, Jodie's moving back home,

03:06.252 --> 03:07.753
and he's bringing
his baby with him,

03:07.754 --> 03:10.255
and the baby is gonna sleep
in the nursery.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.757
Look, let me explain it to you.
The baby...

03:11.758 --> 03:13.759
Hey, hey.
I got it. I got it.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.762
God, it's like
talking to a brick.

03:16.763 --> 03:18.764
Jodie and Danny are
going to share a room,

03:18.765 --> 03:21.266
so you and I are going to have
to share our room again.

03:21.267 --> 03:23.268
Hi.

03:23.269 --> 03:26.271
Mary, can I please
sleep with the baby?

03:26.272 --> 03:27.773
I love that baby,

03:27.774 --> 03:29.775
and I've always loved that baby,

03:29.776 --> 03:33.779
and even more important,
I really hate Chuck.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.781
That's the arrangement.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.282
Take it or leave it.

03:37.283 --> 03:38.283
Hey, Mare, where is everybody?

03:38.284 --> 03:40.285
Jodie, come on over here.

03:40.286 --> 03:41.787
Oh, look at this, look at that.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.288
Is this great?
All the kids here.

03:43.289 --> 03:45.290
Ah, my three sons.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.291
I feel like Fred MacMurray.

03:46.292 --> 03:47.292
Come on.

03:47.293 --> 03:48.794
We're going to go out tonight.

03:48.795 --> 03:51.296
We'll do something special.
Come on, what do you want to do?

03:51.297 --> 03:52.798
The whole family goes.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.299
We'll go bowling,
we'll shoot a little pool.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.300
Jodie, it's your night.

03:55.301 --> 03:56.301
Whatever you want.
Name it.

03:56.302 --> 03:58.303
I want to go apartment hunting.

03:58.304 --> 03:59.805
Bob...

03:59.806 --> 04:01.306
Would you just calm down?

04:01.307 --> 04:02.808
No, no, no.

04:02.809 --> 04:03.809
That's the way I want it.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.310
I'll move.

04:05.311 --> 04:06.812
I'll live alone.

04:06.813 --> 04:09.314
And if I get murdered
in my sleep,

04:09.315 --> 04:11.817
it's on your head.

04:11.818 --> 04:12.818
That's ridiculous.

04:12.819 --> 04:14.319
It sure is.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.821
How could you possibly
get your own place?

04:15.822 --> 04:17.322
Huh?

04:17.322 --> 04:19.825
You have to stand on a chair
to open a door.

04:21.827 --> 04:22.828
Oh, Jodie.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.329
Jodie, Jodie, Jodie.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.831
Aw, Ma.

04:25.832 --> 04:27.833
I'm going to make your
favorite meal tonight,

04:27.834 --> 04:29.334
just for you, in honor
of your homecoming.

04:29.335 --> 04:30.335
Thanks, Ma.

04:30.336 --> 04:31.837
Hey Jodie,

04:31.838 --> 04:33.338
the Knicks are playing
at the Garden tonight.

04:33.339 --> 04:34.339
These are center court.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.841
I really had to pull strings.

04:35.842 --> 04:37.342
Whoa, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

04:37.343 --> 04:38.844
I was going to
take him bowling here.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.345
All of us, I reserved an alley.

04:40.346 --> 04:41.847
I was gonna cook
something special

04:41.848 --> 04:42.848
and drive us all
to Coney Island,

04:42.849 --> 04:44.349
just like when you were little.

04:44.350 --> 04:46.351
Coney Island?
Uh, what were you going to cook?

04:46.352 --> 04:48.353
This alley's free, guys.
Huh? It's our alley.

04:48.354 --> 04:49.855
Burt, the Knicks
are playing the Lakers.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.857
So, they are.

04:51.858 --> 04:52.858
Lasagna.
Lasagna?

04:52.859 --> 04:53.859
What time is the game?

04:53.860 --> 04:55.360
We can go on the Cyclone.

04:55.361 --> 04:56.862
You used to love the Cyclone.

04:56.863 --> 04:58.363
The Cyclone?

04:58.364 --> 04:59.865
Hey, Dan, you got
an extra ticket?

04:59.866 --> 05:01.366
Frozen custard.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.368
Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.370
Of course, it's entirely
up to you, Jodie.

05:05.371 --> 05:07.372
Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs?

05:07.373 --> 05:09.374
And frozen custard.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.376
I love the Cyclone.

05:11.377 --> 05:12.377
What time is the game?
Danny, please.

05:12.378 --> 05:13.378
JODIE:
Hold it, hold it.

05:13.379 --> 05:14.880
Listen, everybody.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.882
I really appreciate this,
and it all sounds great,

05:16.883 --> 05:18.884
but what do you say
we all stay home together?

05:18.885 --> 05:20.385
I mean, the whole family,

05:20.386 --> 05:22.387
and we can eat some lasagna
and play with Wendy.

05:22.388 --> 05:23.388
What do you say?

05:23.389 --> 05:24.389
That's cool.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.392
Yeah, sure, if that's
what you call fun.

05:30.396 --> 05:32.397
And... And then we can
have a nice chat, huh?

05:32.398 --> 05:34.900
I'd love nothing more.

05:34.901 --> 05:35.901
Sure.

05:35.902 --> 05:37.402
Hey, you got an extra ticket?

05:37.403 --> 05:39.905
So, we're not going
to Coney Island, is that it?

05:39.906 --> 05:41.406
You mean you still want to go?

05:41.407 --> 05:42.908
Okay, Dan, what time
is that game?

05:42.909 --> 05:44.409
Because if you'd like to go,

05:44.410 --> 05:45.410
we could go.

05:45.411 --> 05:46.411
I'd love to go.

05:46.412 --> 05:47.412
I'd love to go to the game.

05:47.413 --> 05:48.413
Well, you know,

05:48.414 --> 05:50.415
just long enough
to chow down a dog,

05:50.416 --> 05:52.417
take a spin on the Cyclone,
a little frozen custard.

05:52.418 --> 05:53.418
Let me have those here.

05:53.419 --> 05:54.419
Take it.
Thank you very much.

05:54.420 --> 05:55.921
Hey. Welcome home, Jodie.

05:55.922 --> 05:56.922
Chuck, Bob, get your coat.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.424
All right!

06:00.426 --> 06:01.426
We won't be long, Jodie.

06:01.427 --> 06:02.427
I'll wait up.

06:02.428 --> 06:03.428
Don't bother.

06:03.429 --> 06:04.429
Put the lasagna in the oven

06:04.430 --> 06:06.431
for an hour at 350 degrees.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.433
It's so wonderful

06:08.434 --> 06:09.935
having my family together again.

06:17.443 --> 06:18.944
Yes.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.453
Daddy should be here any moment.

06:28.454 --> 06:30.456
Just make yourselves
comfortable.

06:32.959 --> 06:35.961
You know, Chester,
I feel kind of funny

06:35.962 --> 06:37.963
discussing our marital problems

06:37.964 --> 06:39.464
with a minister.

06:39.465 --> 06:40.465
I feel funny

06:40.466 --> 06:41.466
discussing it with anybody.

06:41.467 --> 06:42.467
Of course,

06:42.468 --> 06:44.469
it would be worse
if it were a priest.

06:44.470 --> 06:46.972
Well, it would be
like discussing a film

06:46.973 --> 06:48.975
with a blind man.

06:51.818 --> 06:52.978
A rabbi would have been nice.

06:52.979 --> 06:55.480
They seem very wise.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.983
But I suppose
you have to be Jewish.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.484
I wonder which religion

06:59.485 --> 07:01.987
does the biggest business
in this sort of thing.

07:02.989 --> 07:05.490
Ah, sorry I'm late.

07:05.491 --> 07:07.493
Got stuck at a death.

07:10.496 --> 07:11.496
I beg your pardon?

07:11.497 --> 07:12.497
Funeral.

07:12.498 --> 07:13.498
Just did a funeral.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.500
Poor guy got killed
roller-skating.

07:15.501 --> 07:17.002
Oh.

07:17.003 --> 07:18.503
He fell?

07:18.504 --> 07:19.504
Drowned.

07:19.505 --> 07:21.006
Was skating in the park,
couldn't stop,

07:21.007 --> 07:22.507
skated into the lake,
couldn't swim,

07:22.508 --> 07:23.509
that was that.

07:26.012 --> 07:29.514
Left a wife, two kids,
and a Porsche with no problems.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.516
But...

07:31.517 --> 07:32.517
on to happier things.

07:32.518 --> 07:33.518
You are the Tates,

07:33.519 --> 07:35.020
and you are here because...?

07:38.024 --> 07:39.524
Go ahead, Chester.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.026
Oh, no, Jess, you can go first.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.527
No, you tell it better.

07:42.528 --> 07:43.529
Well...

07:44.530 --> 07:47.032
Uh, well, we...
have a problem.

07:47.033 --> 07:49.034
Not a big problem, really.

07:49.035 --> 07:50.035
Actually, it's a little problem,

07:50.036 --> 07:52.037
but it's big enough
to be a problem.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.538
It's been a problem for a while.

07:53.539 --> 07:55.040
I never thought
it was a problem.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.541
But, uh...

07:56.542 --> 07:59.044
now I see that the problem,
which is our problem,

07:59.045 --> 08:00.045
is really my problem,

08:00.046 --> 08:02.547
and of course, being my problem,
it actually becomes her problem.

08:02.548 --> 08:06.551
That, in a nutshell,
is the problem.

08:06.552 --> 08:10.555
Well put, Chester.

08:10.556 --> 08:12.057
Could you be
a little more specific,

08:12.058 --> 08:13.558
do you suppose?

08:13.559 --> 08:15.560
Chester goes through women

08:15.561 --> 08:19.064
the way an elephant
goes through peanuts.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.567
See, he fools around

08:22.568 --> 08:24.569
with anything,
any time, anywhere.

08:24.570 --> 08:28.073
He lies, he deceives,
he sneaks around.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.574
He cheats before work.

08:29.575 --> 08:31.076
He cheats during work.

08:31.077 --> 08:32.077
He cheats after work.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.078
He cheated on our honeymoon.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.080
He cheated on our anniversary.

08:35.081 --> 08:39.583
He cheated while I was in labor
in the hospital...

08:39.585 --> 08:42.087
in the hospital.

08:42.087 --> 08:43.087
He has cheated

08:43.089 --> 08:45.590
practically every week
of every month of every year

08:45.591 --> 08:47.092
of our entire marriage,

08:47.093 --> 08:48.593
but other than that,

08:48.594 --> 08:52.097
he has been a wonderful husband.

08:55.101 --> 08:56.601
I see.

08:56.602 --> 08:59.604
Well, it certainly did take you
a long time to come and see me.

08:59.605 --> 09:00.605
It took her all this time

09:00.606 --> 09:02.607
to catch me.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.609
Of course.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.111
Well, uh...

09:06.112 --> 09:08.113
I see this sort of problem
a lot.

09:08.114 --> 09:10.115
It seems to be going around.

09:10.116 --> 09:13.618
I think part of the reason is...

09:13.619 --> 09:16.121
that there are no more Indians.

09:21.627 --> 09:23.628
I beg your pardon?

09:23.629 --> 09:27.132
You see, in the olden days,
we had Indians to worry about.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.134
Where were the Indians?

09:29.135 --> 09:30.135
Were the Indians surrounding us?

09:30.136 --> 09:32.637
Were the Indians angry Indians?

09:32.638 --> 09:34.139
Did the Indians want our horses?

09:34.140 --> 09:35.640
Nobody fooled around

09:35.641 --> 09:38.143
because you couldn't
relax long enough.

09:40.146 --> 09:43.648
Now we've got no more Indians.

09:43.649 --> 09:47.152
I see.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.654
The best marriages
were in the Apache territory,

09:49.655 --> 09:52.157
because those were
the worst Indians.

09:52.158 --> 09:55.660
Hostiles without,
no hostility within.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.663
We have a lot
to thank the Indians for.

09:58.664 --> 10:00.165
Happy marriages.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.667
Nice beadwork.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.669
Uh, well, what do we do

10:04.670 --> 10:08.173
now that there are
no more Indians?

10:08.174 --> 10:12.677
Aggravate
some other group, maybe.

10:12.678 --> 10:16.681
Uh, look, I don't think
I need Indians.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.183
I want to change.

10:18.184 --> 10:20.185
I want desperately never to look
at another woman again,

10:20.186 --> 10:23.188
and I sincerely think
that I can do that.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.190
Excuse me. Daddy.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.192
Can I please borrow the car key?

10:27.193 --> 10:28.694
Sure, Angel puss.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.197
Thanks.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.201
My daughter.

10:36.202 --> 10:40.205
I see the resemblance.

10:40.206 --> 10:43.208
Well, Mr. Tate,
I see your problem.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.709
I have trouble understanding it,

10:44.710 --> 10:46.211
but I do see it.

10:46.212 --> 10:50.215
I mean, if I had
such a lovely, feminine,

10:50.216 --> 10:53.718
genteel, sophisticated,

10:53.719 --> 10:59.724
enticing, gorgeous,
gorgeous, gorgeous

10:59.725 --> 11:01.726
piece of gorgeousness
in my house,

11:01.727 --> 11:03.728
I'd never leave.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.235
Well, yes, of course,
but, I mean, you see,

11:10.236 --> 11:13.238
the problem...
Gorgeous, gorgeous.

11:13.239 --> 11:17.242
Uh, Your Ministry, uh...

11:17.243 --> 11:21.746
how do you keep your marriage
trouble-free?

11:21.747 --> 11:23.749
Divorce.

11:26.252 --> 11:27.252
Married 16 years.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.754
My wife decided
we had to have new carpeting.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.756
Guy came to lay the carpet.

11:31.757 --> 11:35.260
Probably got a little confused
about what he was there to lay.

11:39.765 --> 11:41.766
Left me
with four rolls of Bigelow shag

11:41.767 --> 11:44.769
and took off with my wife.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.271
How awful.

11:46.272 --> 11:48.274
Might have been an Indian.

11:50.276 --> 11:51.776
Well, that's beside the point.

11:51.777 --> 11:53.278
We're here to help you people.

11:53.279 --> 11:55.280
Now...

11:55.281 --> 11:58.283
the problem
is Mr. Tate's.

11:58.284 --> 12:00.285
It is not your problem.

12:00.286 --> 12:02.787
You have no problems.

12:02.788 --> 12:04.790
<i>Au contraire.</i>

12:06.792 --> 12:09.294
Now, Mr. Tate,
we have a group

12:09.295 --> 12:11.296
that meets here once a week.

12:11.297 --> 12:12.797
It's a bunch of men
like yourself

12:12.798 --> 12:13.798
with the same sort of problem.

12:13.799 --> 12:16.301
It's kind of a...
group therapy situation

12:16.302 --> 12:18.803
led by a very competent
lay therapist.

12:18.804 --> 12:21.306
I used to lead the group myself,
but I had to quit.

12:21.307 --> 12:24.310
The stories got me too excited.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.317
You should hear those guys talk.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.820
Anyway, I think
it'll do you a lot of good.

12:35.821 --> 12:36.861
Come tomorrow night, 8:00.

12:37.823 --> 12:39.324
Well, I've got to run.

12:39.325 --> 12:40.325
A wedding.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.326
Complete waste of time.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.328
They haven't got a chance.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.829
He's 49.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.831
She's 21,
been married four times.

12:46.832 --> 12:47.833
I give it 10 days.

12:50.836 --> 12:52.838
Gorgeous.

13:10.356 --> 13:11.856
Yeah?

13:11.857 --> 13:12.857
Hi.

13:12.858 --> 13:13.858
Make it fast.

13:13.859 --> 13:15.360
Uh...
We don't want any.

13:23.369 --> 13:24.369
Yeah?

13:24.370 --> 13:26.371
Is this 58 Milburn Street?

13:26.372 --> 13:27.372
Who wants to know?

13:27.373 --> 13:28.873
I'm looking for Polly Dawson.

13:28.874 --> 13:29.875
I ain't her.

13:37.383 --> 13:41.386
Do you have me confused
with somebody you really hate?

13:41.387 --> 13:42.387
You see this?

13:42.388 --> 13:44.889
Yes, I do. I see that.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.391
Take a good look at it,

13:46.392 --> 13:48.393
because in about two seconds,
it's going to be behind you.

13:48.394 --> 13:50.895
Look, could you just tell Polly
that I'm here?

13:50.896 --> 13:51.896
I'd rather not.

13:51.897 --> 13:53.398
For me?
Beat it.

13:53.399 --> 13:54.899
Can I leave a note?
Eddie.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.901
What's going on
around here? Nothing, Momma.

13:56.902 --> 13:58.903
Oh, excuse me. Hi.

13:58.904 --> 13:59.904
I'm here to see Polly.

13:59.905 --> 14:02.407
Oh, for God sake, Eddie,
let the man in.

14:05.411 --> 14:06.411
Hi.

14:06.412 --> 14:07.912
Polly...

14:07.913 --> 14:09.914
someone to see you.

14:09.915 --> 14:11.416
POLLY: Coming!

14:13.419 --> 14:14.419
Danny.

14:14.420 --> 14:15.920
I was in the neighborhood.

14:15.921 --> 14:16.921
I thought I...

14:16.922 --> 14:17.922
Hey, who is this creep?

14:17.923 --> 14:18.923
Uh, this is Danny.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.425
Hi there.

14:20.426 --> 14:21.926
Where did you find him?

14:21.927 --> 14:23.928
We met last week
at the cemetery.

14:23.929 --> 14:27.432
Oh, you hang around cemeteries.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.934
I was there visiting my wife.

14:29.935 --> 14:30.935
Oh, and you just happened

14:30.936 --> 14:31.936
to pick up this black chick

14:31.937 --> 14:33.438
along the way,

14:33.439 --> 14:35.940
so the day wouldn't
be a total loss.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.942
Why don't you sit down
and make yourself comfortable?

14:37.943 --> 14:39.444
I'm Polly's mother

14:39.445 --> 14:41.446
and this is her brother, Eddie.

14:41.447 --> 14:42.947
Hi.

14:42.948 --> 14:44.449
Why don't you get out now

14:44.450 --> 14:45.950
while you can still crawl.

14:45.951 --> 14:47.953
I think he's warming up to me.

14:49.455 --> 14:52.957
Eddie, why don't you
get out of here.

14:52.958 --> 14:56.461
Next time, I won't be so polite.

14:59.965 --> 15:01.466
So...

15:01.467 --> 15:02.967
uh, how'd you find me?

15:02.968 --> 15:04.969
It was easy, really.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.971
My stepfather
and my brother and me

15:06.972 --> 15:08.473
staked out the graveyard
for a couple of days,

15:08.474 --> 15:09.974
and when you didn't show there,

15:09.975 --> 15:11.476
I just started in
on the phone book.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.978
There's only
a couple of hundred Dawsons.

15:13.979 --> 15:15.980
Oh, I never did tell you
my address, did I?

15:15.981 --> 15:17.982
Or your last name,
or your phone number.

15:17.983 --> 15:20.485
Well, you didn't ask.

15:20.486 --> 15:22.487
I didn't think
it was a good time.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.989
I guess you changed
your mind, huh?

15:24.990 --> 15:26.991
Yeah, I did.

15:26.992 --> 15:30.995
I don't hear nobody talking.

15:30.996 --> 15:33.998
I was taking a breath, Eddie.

15:33.999 --> 15:36.000
Is it all right if we breathe?

15:36.001 --> 15:39.504
Okay, so long
as it don't become audible.

15:43.008 --> 15:45.510
It's just that
I felt really good

15:45.511 --> 15:47.011
that afternoon.

15:47.012 --> 15:48.513
I haven't felt that good
in a long time,

15:48.514 --> 15:49.514
and I...

15:49.515 --> 15:52.016
I wanted to feel that way again,
so I found you.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.518
Was that okay?

15:53.519 --> 15:57.522
Yes, because I felt
the same way.

15:57.523 --> 15:58.523
You did?

15:58.524 --> 16:00.024
Yes.

16:00.025 --> 16:02.027
EDDIE: Sounds
like a damn movie.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.030
Then you're glad I'm here?

16:06.031 --> 16:07.532
Glad?

16:07.533 --> 16:09.033
I'm amazed.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.535
EDDIE:
I'm incensed.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.037
Eddie!

16:13.038 --> 16:16.040
I thought I might not
ever see you again.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.041
I got a little worried.

16:17.042 --> 16:18.543
I didn't.

16:18.544 --> 16:19.544
You didn't?
Uh-uh,

16:19.545 --> 16:21.045
because there are only
seven Dallases

16:21.046 --> 16:22.046
in the phone book.

16:23.549 --> 16:26.050
See, I did
a little research too.

16:26.051 --> 16:27.051
I guess this means

16:27.052 --> 16:29.053
that maybe I can see you
some more, then, huh?

16:29.054 --> 16:32.057
I would say that's correct.

16:34.059 --> 16:38.062
Will I have to come here?

16:38.063 --> 16:39.564
Eddie, please.

16:42.568 --> 16:45.069
Hey, look, it's only
about 7:00 now.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.571
Do you want to go out?

16:46.572 --> 16:48.072
Sure, let's go.

16:48.073 --> 16:51.576
EDDIE:
Have her home by 8:00.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.578
Momma, I'm going to
go out for a few hours.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.580
Oh, honey,
if you go by the cemetery,

16:55.581 --> 16:57.582
stop by Grandpa and say hi.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.083
Oh, we're not going to
go there, Ma.

16:59.084 --> 17:00.585
Oh.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.086
Ready?
Yes.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.588
It was nice meeting you.

17:03.589 --> 17:06.089
Oh, nice meeting you, Danny.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.093
See you again, brother.

17:14.098 --> 17:16.601
You touch one hair on her head,

17:16.602 --> 17:19.605
and I will touch
every bone in your head.

17:22.107 --> 17:24.608
He's a little hostile, isn't he?

17:24.609 --> 17:25.609
Oh, don't worry about Eddie.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.111
He gets it from our father.

17:27.112 --> 17:29.114
That's comforting.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.126
Hey, Doc.
Hey.

17:42.127 --> 17:43.127
How you doing, Doc?

17:43.128 --> 17:45.129
Come on, sit down.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.631
Yeah, all right.
Come on.

17:46.632 --> 17:48.132
What's the matter?
Come on, why so glum?

17:48.133 --> 17:50.134
Dow Jones down again?

17:50.135 --> 17:54.138
Burt, I wanted to talk to you
without Mary.

17:54.139 --> 17:57.642
Something's the matter
with Mary?

17:57.643 --> 17:59.143
Wait a minute. D-Doc...

17:59.144 --> 18:00.144
What...? God, she's sick.

18:00.145 --> 18:01.145
Oh, she's not going to die...

18:01.146 --> 18:02.647
No, no, no, Mary...
Mary's fine.

18:02.648 --> 18:03.648
She's never been better.

18:03.649 --> 18:05.149
Oh, good.
Thank you, Doc.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.151
I love you, Doc.
I love you, Doc.

18:07.152 --> 18:10.155
In fact, she's pregnant.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.160
Pregnant? Mary?

18:16.161 --> 18:17.161
That's right.

18:17.162 --> 18:20.164
You mean
she's going to have a baby?

18:20.165 --> 18:22.166
That's what it usually means.

18:25.170 --> 18:27.672
A baby! Ha ha!

18:27.673 --> 18:29.674
Oh, I love it. A baby.

18:29.675 --> 18:30.675
Mary and I...

18:30.676 --> 18:32.176
That'll be
our first baby together.

18:32.177 --> 18:33.177
Doc...

18:33.178 --> 18:34.178
A baby!

18:34.179 --> 18:35.680
Oh, God. Thank you.
You're terrific.

18:35.681 --> 18:37.181
Oh, a baby.
Doc, Doc, Doc...

18:37.182 --> 18:39.183
Mary and I are
gonna have a baby.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.685
I know.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.186
I...

18:42.187 --> 18:43.187
I can't believe it.

18:43.188 --> 18:45.690
Now, Burt, there's something
we have to talk about.

18:45.691 --> 18:47.191
What? I know, I know.
What? Our age.

18:47.192 --> 18:48.693
We're not old. Come on.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.695
It's better to have a baby
when you're older,

18:50.696 --> 18:51.696
because you're smarter.

18:51.697 --> 18:52.697
Really...

18:52.698 --> 18:54.198
you've got more experience,
you know more things,

18:54.199 --> 18:56.701
and... and you don't care so much
about your clothes.

18:56.702 --> 18:59.203
Burt, it's not all good news.

18:59.204 --> 19:00.705
I... Come on, Doc. I know.

19:00.706 --> 19:01.706
What? You never sleep.

19:01.707 --> 19:02.707
Doc, I had three kids.

19:02.708 --> 19:03.708
I didn't sleep for five years.

19:03.709 --> 19:06.210
One or two naps,
pfft, that was it.

19:06.211 --> 19:08.212
Besides, the older you get,
the less sleep you need.

19:08.213 --> 19:09.714
It's a medical fact.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.716
Don't you ever read <i>Newsweek?</i>

19:11.717 --> 19:13.217
Burt, that's not all.

19:13.218 --> 19:14.218
Twins!

19:14.219 --> 19:15.219
We get twins!

19:15.220 --> 19:17.722
Whoo-hoo! Twins!

19:17.723 --> 19:18.723
Two of them!

19:18.724 --> 19:19.724
That's... Oh, God, that's great.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.225
Twins. That's great.

19:21.226 --> 19:22.226
No, no. It's... It's not...

19:22.227 --> 19:23.728
Yes, Doc.

19:23.729 --> 19:25.229
I'm telling you,
it's great, it's great.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.230
I just won't
dress them the same.

19:26.231 --> 19:27.231
I hate that.

19:27.232 --> 19:29.233
I got two old maid twin aunts.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.234
They're 80 now.

19:30.235 --> 19:31.736
They still dress the same.

19:31.737 --> 19:33.738
Every day, they wake up

19:33.739 --> 19:35.239
and argue about
what they're gonna wear.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.240
They're very weird.

19:36.241 --> 19:37.742
Burt, that's not it.

19:37.743 --> 19:38.743
You're probably right.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.745
They were probably weird
to begin with.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.246
No, Burt, it's you.

19:42.247 --> 19:44.749
Yeah, I have been called weird.

19:44.750 --> 19:48.753
Burt, uh, you remember
the tests we did?

19:48.754 --> 19:49.754
Do I remember?

19:49.755 --> 19:51.255
You should see my arms.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.757
I look like a junkie here.

19:52.758 --> 19:56.260
And then you remember
we did a second bunch of tests?

19:56.261 --> 19:57.762
Yes, you took
the rest of my blood.

19:57.763 --> 19:59.764
What, I got
maybe a half a cup left

19:59.765 --> 20:02.266
dashing around my body,
trying to cover it all.

20:02.267 --> 20:05.269
Both sets came back
the same, Burt.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.270
Good. That's a relief.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.773
Then I don't have to do it
a third time.

20:08.774 --> 20:13.278
Burt, I'm afraid
you're a very sick man.

20:17.783 --> 20:18.783
Uh-huh.

20:18.784 --> 20:21.786
You have Mylar Syndrome.

20:21.787 --> 20:24.289
It's a very rare blood disease.

20:26.291 --> 20:27.291
Yeah, so?

20:27.292 --> 20:28.793
What's the cure?

20:28.794 --> 20:30.295
There is no cure.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.798
What happens?

20:33.799 --> 20:36.300
What... What, do you mean
it just goes away all by itself?

20:36.301 --> 20:37.302
I'm afraid not.

20:39.304 --> 20:42.307
Well, what happens?

20:43.809 --> 20:45.310
It's fatal, Burt.

20:47.312 --> 20:49.814
I'm sorry.

20:52.317 --> 20:54.319
Mm-hmm.

20:56.321 --> 20:57.822
Are you sure?

20:57.823 --> 21:01.826
That's why we did
the second battery of tests.

21:01.827 --> 21:05.329
There. That's me?

21:05.330 --> 21:06.831
Yeah.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.332
No.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.834
Burt...

21:09.835 --> 21:10.835
No. No, no.

21:10.836 --> 21:12.837
You just told me
we're having a baby.

21:12.838 --> 21:13.838
Burt, you are.

21:13.839 --> 21:16.340
Then I can't die.
I'm not dying. I can't.

21:16.341 --> 21:18.342
Burt, I wish there was
something I could do.

21:18.343 --> 21:19.844
I wish there was
one thing I could do.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.357
How long?

21:33.358 --> 21:35.359
I mean, what, how much time?

21:35.360 --> 21:36.861
About five months.

21:36.862 --> 21:39.363
Five months?

21:39.364 --> 21:41.866
Everybody else gets six.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.367
They always say,
"Six months to a year."

21:43.368 --> 21:46.871
What is this?
I get five?

21:46.872 --> 21:47.872
It... It could be six, Burt.

21:47.873 --> 21:49.874
It could be.
It could be six. No, I...

21:49.875 --> 21:51.375
No, I don't believe that.

21:51.376 --> 21:52.376
I don't.
What do you...?

21:52.377 --> 21:53.878
What do you call this stuff?

21:53.879 --> 21:55.880
It's... It's, uh...
Mylar Syndrome.

21:55.881 --> 21:57.882
Well, you've got
nothing for it here?

21:57.883 --> 21:58.883
You've got... You've got...

21:58.884 --> 22:00.885
You've got wonder drugs
and machines and men on Mars,

22:00.886 --> 22:02.887
and you've got nothing
for this stuff here?

22:02.888 --> 22:03.888
What, Mylar wins?

22:03.889 --> 22:05.390
I'm afraid so.

22:13.899 --> 22:16.400
I gotta go.

22:16.401 --> 22:18.903
Are you going to be okay, Burt?

22:18.904 --> 22:21.406
Apparently not.

22:22.908 --> 22:24.408
I'm sorry.

22:24.409 --> 22:25.409
I'm sorry.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.911
Doc, Doc, I'm sorry.

22:26.912 --> 22:28.412
Come on, it's not your fault.

22:28.413 --> 22:30.915
It's not your fault.

22:30.916 --> 22:32.417
You okay?

22:34.419 --> 22:36.921
Burt, if there's
anything I can do...

22:47.933 --> 22:50.435
Are you sure?

22:52.437 --> 22:53.437
Yeah.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.941
That's incredible.

22:56.942 --> 23:00.445
On the happiest day of my life,
you tell me I have no life.

23:05.951 --> 23:06.952
I'll see you, Doc.

23:19.464 --> 23:21.465
ANNOUNCER:
<i>What will happen with Danny and Polly?</i>

23:21.466 --> 23:22.967
<i>Will her brother let it happen?</i>

23:22.968 --> 23:24.969
<i>Now that he's dying,</i>
<i>what will Burt do?</i>

23:24.970 --> 23:25.970
<i>Will he do it quickly?</i>

23:25.971 --> 23:26.971
<i>Will he tell Mary?</i>

23:26.972 --> 23:28.472
<i>Will he pay his doctor's bill?</i>

23:28.473 --> 23:29.974
<i>Will Chester</i>
<i>get himself some help</i>

23:29.975 --> 23:31.475

<i>to the minister's daughter?</i>
