01:48.676 --> 01:50.211
Aww.

Nice.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.186

You know what time it is now?

02:11.632 --> 02:12.433
It's party time.

KATE:
I...I'm really glad you
had time to talk,

02:28.749 --> 02:30.518
I just wish you could have
come out here,

02:30.551 --> 02:32.586
you know, it's so beautiful.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.888
BRAD:
I wish I could have
made it work with my schedule.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.590
Say, isn't there a
going away party being thrown

02:36.624 --> 02:37.891
in your honour?

02:37.925 --> 02:39.159
KATE:
Yeah.

02:39.193 --> 02:44.632
I mean I could go to the party
or I could stay here with you.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.835
BRAD:
Kate, anybody could walk in.

02:47.868 --> 02:48.636
KATE:
I know.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.804
You know, we could...

02:51.739 --> 02:53.741
BRAD:
(coughing)

02:53.774 --> 02:55.108
KATE:
Are you okay?

02:55.142 --> 02:59.547
BRAD:
Yeah, that's why I always
keep an emergency water handy.

03:00.414 --> 03:01.449
KATE:
Heh.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.520

I love you One-Week-From-Now-

JOE:
Hey!

03:31.512 --> 03:33.914
(laughing)

03:33.947 --> 03:37.385
We were...
we were dancing.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.019
Uh, Kate!

03:39.052 --> 03:42.823
Uh, I guess this is your
last weekend of freedom.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.893
KATE:
Well I always wanna
think of myself as free,

03:45.926 --> 03:48.462
whether I'm
married or not, Mr Shay.

03:48.496 --> 03:52.266
JOE:
You know, it's a party,
you're leaving tomorrow,

03:52.300 --> 03:56.270
I'm not your
assistant principle anymore.

03:56.304 --> 03:59.640
You know, I want you
to think of me as Joe.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.942
KATE:
Okay.

04:01.975 --> 04:04.645
JOE:
And I know you have
an interest in literature,

04:04.678 --> 04:07.615
you know, and back at mine
I have some first editions

04:07.648 --> 04:10.017
that I would love to show you.

04:10.050 --> 04:14.622
KATE:
Uh, well I'm sure
your first editions are um,

04:14.655 --> 04:16.023
impressive...

04:16.055 --> 04:20.327
you know have my own
waiting for me back home.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.762
So...

04:21.795 --> 04:23.864
ALLAN:
Joe you sly fox,
you hitting on Miss Katie again?

04:23.897 --> 04:28.001
JOE:
Uh, yes, yes I was, but I
had a better line this time.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.538
I've been working on it,
and oh, I'm being

04:30.571 --> 04:33.374
dragged away now, yeah, okay.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.475
KATE:
(laughing)

04:34.508 --> 04:35.343
Thank you.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.344
ALLAN:
Sorry.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.546
I have no idea how to
explain what that was.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.814
KATE:
It's...it's okay,
I'm used to it by now,

04:40.848 --> 04:44.618
and to be fair, he did put a
little bit more effort into it;

04:44.652 --> 04:45.953
this time it wasn't all
just smiling and,

04:45.986 --> 04:48.021
you know, bumping
against me, so.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.423
ALLAN:
Yes, he is getting better.

04:49.457 --> 04:50.324
KATE:
Yeah.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.592
ALLAN:
As we all are,
thanks to you.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.760
KATE:
Aw, you're sweet.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.495
ALLAN:
I gotta go do something.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.330
WOMAN:
Now, come this way.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.065
KATE:
Oh...

05:00.734 --> 05:02.603
ALLAN:
Excuse me, everyone?

05:02.636 --> 05:06.874
As we all know, tonight
is our last night with Kate.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.776
She's leaving us
tomorrow morning,

05:08.809 --> 05:10.911
back to civilization,
and to her family,

05:10.944 --> 05:12.780
and to get married.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.016
We wanna thank you for
coming up all the way to our

05:16.049 --> 05:18.419
little community
and giving of yourself.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.821
It takes a special person to
come up here and live

05:20.854 --> 05:23.957
and work with us out of the
goodness of their heart.

05:23.991 --> 05:24.825
(sighs)

05:24.858 --> 05:26.093
'Cause we know
it's not for the money.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.429
KATE:
(chuckles)

05:28.462 --> 05:31.799
ALLAN:
It's not for everyone,
but you fit right in,

05:31.832 --> 05:34.568
and we really wish we could
talk you into coming back to us.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.637
JOE:
Me too.

05:37.638 --> 05:40.474
ALLAN:
Kate, although
it's only been a short time,

05:40.508 --> 05:42.776
we will miss you.

05:42.810 --> 05:47.615
We love you, and you will
always be a part of our family.

05:47.648 --> 05:51.552

05:51.585 --> 05:52.886
(wind blowing)

05:52.920 --> 05:54.622
ALLAN:
Alright, enough of this,
let's dance!

05:54.655 --> 05:56.824

ANNOUNCER (over radio):
Man, now that was some

06:03.030 --> 06:04.998
storm last night, huh?

06:05.032 --> 06:06.900
You're waking up
to a record snowfall,

06:06.934 --> 06:08.902
Sorenson Lake,
be prepared folks,

06:08.936 --> 06:10.771
our little town
is buried,

06:10.804 --> 06:12.573
it's gonna be days
before we get everything

06:12.606 --> 06:14.007
up and running again.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.776
On the bright side though,
if you're already,

06:15.809 --> 06:18.111
you know, toasty warm at home,
maybe still in bed,

06:18.145 --> 06:20.013
stay there.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.982
No one's gonna
be working today.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.717
Stay tuned for more updates.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.919
Coming up next in sports,
top of the hour, we'll--.

07:07.761 --> 07:20.708

Ugh.

08:45.726 --> 08:49.563
(rustling)

08:51.965 --> 08:54.267
KATE:

09:08.849 --> 09:15.122
(vehicle approaching)

(revving)

09:18.225 --> 09:19.026
(snowmobile stops)

09:19.059 --> 09:22.329
KATE:
Hello.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.303
Hi.

09:33.974 --> 09:37.177
(door sticks)

09:40.981 --> 09:42.582
(bang)

09:44.184 --> 09:46.854
(door opens)

09:47.755 --> 09:49.823
KATE:
Uh, excuse me.

09:49.857 --> 09:52.626
Are you the pilot?

09:52.660 --> 09:54.695
When do we leave?

09:55.295 --> 09:58.098
REDFORD:
Do I look like a pilot?

09:58.131 --> 10:04.271
KATE:
Okay...uh, so where
are the pilots then?

10:06.740 --> 10:10.678
REDFORD:
Do you see
a runway out there?

10:10.911 --> 10:13.113
KATE:
Uh, nope.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.015
REDFORD:
Because it's under
three feet of snow.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.284
They can't land the plane
or take off without a runway,

10:17.317 --> 10:18.686
hence, no pilots.

10:18.719 --> 10:23.190
KATE:
Okay, but I, I have a ticket
for a flight that leaves today,

10:23.223 --> 10:25.425
to Snowy Pines.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.060
REDFORD:
Yeah, so do I.

10:28.829 --> 10:32.766
KATE:
Uh, I...I'm getting married
in a couple of days,

10:32.800 --> 10:34.301
in Snowy Pines.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.237
REDFORD:
Hah.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.906
Good luck with that.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.809
(door thuds)

10:43.076 --> 10:45.345
KATE:
Hey!

10:48.115 --> 10:50.083
Where, where are you going?

10:50.117 --> 10:52.986
Will you just, can you
just stop for a second?

10:55.122 --> 10:55.989
(thud)

10:56.023 --> 10:56.824
REDFORD:
Ow!

10:56.857 --> 10:58.425
Ah!

10:59.159 --> 11:00.193
KATE:
I'm sorry.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.029
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.964
You, you were just
gonna leave me here,

11:03.997 --> 11:05.933
you can't just leave me here.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.467
REDFORD:
Who throws a candle?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.369
KATE:
I just really need
to get to Snowy Pines.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.871
REDFORD:
Lady, I mind my own business.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.206
KATE:
Okay, well so do I,
but sometimes,

11:13.240 --> 11:14.474
I like to help people.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.408
REDFORD:
Lady.

11:15.442 --> 11:16.476
KATE:
Okay.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.880
When do you think the
runways are gonna be open.

11:19.913 --> 11:20.981
REDFORD:
A week.

11:21.014 --> 11:21.849
KATE:
A week.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.350
What about the roads.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.918
REDFORD:
72 hours.

11:24.952 --> 11:25.986
KATE:
72 hours?

11:26.019 --> 11:28.288
I don't, haha,
I don't have 72 hours,

11:28.321 --> 11:31.158
so what am I
supposed to do here?

11:31.424 --> 11:33.727
Are you, are you
going on this thing?

11:33.761 --> 11:34.962
Will you take me with you?

11:34.995 --> 11:36.730
Why don't I just go with you,
I will pay you.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.365
REDFORD:
I'm sorry, no.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.801
I don't need the extra baggage.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.003
(snowmobile starts)

11:43.036 --> 11:47.174
(engine revving)

11:53.280 --> 11:57.084

Hello.

12:07.227 --> 12:12.065

I'm a teacher at Kamatnak.

12:12.099 --> 12:15.435
Is it...Preston?

12:16.036 --> 12:19.072
Hi Preston, uh, hey,
you wouldn't happen to

12:19.106 --> 12:22.509
have this snowmobile
for sale, would ya?

12:25.979 --> 12:28.315
WEDDING PLANNER:
So, as we've discussed,
we're thinking that maybe

12:28.348 --> 12:30.217
we could start here and then
go back out through

12:30.250 --> 12:31.184
the other side.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.153
EDWARD:
Uh, Cindy!

12:33.186 --> 12:37.124
Cindy, what are you doing,
I told you that the sign,

12:37.157 --> 12:40.260
it hangs in the centre,
above to cover the...

12:40.293 --> 12:41.394
WEDDING PLANNER:
We can actually
hang the sign here--.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.195
EDWARD:
Excuse me.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.163
Cindy!

12:43.196 --> 12:44.898
Your sister's wedding, hello?

12:44.932 --> 12:47.067
CINDY:
Pastor dude told me
I can't stick anything

12:47.100 --> 12:49.169
on that Holy guy.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.271
I don't know what to
do with all that stuff.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.573
EDWARD:
Diane, why is he
not cooperating with us,

12:53.606 --> 12:56.009
this was supposed to be
a done deal,

12:56.043 --> 12:58.411
gah, when is Kate
gonna be here?

12:58.445 --> 13:00.848
CINDY:
Brad went to pick her up
at the airport.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.983
EDWARD:
Well, I should hope so.

13:03.016 --> 13:06.319
Because I am tired of
all this falling on to me.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.222
You know,
'cause I don't need this.

13:09.256 --> 13:12.059
I'm married already,
am I not married already?

13:12.092 --> 13:13.593
DIANE:
Are you giving me
a choice, dear?

13:13.626 --> 13:15.295
EDWARD:
That is not funny,
do not say that,

13:15.328 --> 13:17.497
none of you are funny.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.599
Nobody listens to me,
you're all against me,

13:19.632 --> 13:21.034
and I don't know why--.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.135
Brad, Brad!

13:22.169 --> 13:23.570
Where's Kate?

13:23.603 --> 13:25.906
BRAD:
Everything's fine,
she's just gonna be

13:25.939 --> 13:27.240
a little bit late.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.408
DIANE:
Late?

13:28.441 --> 13:30.577
EDWARD:
How late?

13:30.610 --> 13:32.846
BRAD:
Well...

13:33.580 --> 13:43.590
(snowmobile revving)

14:00.140 --> 14:01.975
REDFORD:
Alright.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.280
(sniff)

14:11.351 --> 14:14.087
Hey, uh, so some bad news.

14:14.121 --> 14:17.357
Got a pretty bad
storm up here,

14:17.390 --> 14:19.492
so no planes in or out.

14:19.526 --> 14:23.363
Probably no graters
on the road for 72 hours,

14:23.396 --> 14:25.598
so I'm gonna jump on my sled.

14:25.632 --> 14:29.036
It's about a three day trek.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.105
I won't have any cellphone
reception so I'll call you

14:32.139 --> 14:36.209
when I can, but I'll be there.

14:38.611 --> 14:48.621
(snowmobile approaching)

14:48.655 --> 14:53.660
(snowmobile approaching)

14:54.061 --> 14:55.095

14:56.129 --> 14:57.564
KATE:
Look, I'm not
asking for any favours.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.466
You're not even gonna know
I'm there,

14:59.499 --> 15:00.567
I'm just gonna follow you.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.035
REDFORD:
No.

15:02.069 --> 15:02.936
KATE:
(scoffs)

15:02.970 --> 15:05.038
Well you can't stop me.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.040
What are you
gonna do with that?

15:07.074 --> 15:07.640
Huh?

15:07.674 --> 15:09.176
Are you gonna shoot me?

15:09.209 --> 15:12.412
Is Mr Big Man
here gonna shoot me,

15:12.445 --> 15:13.947
is that what
you're trying to say?

15:13.981 --> 15:16.083
'Cause I don't
scare that easily,

15:16.116 --> 15:17.284
Mr Big Man.

I saved your life!

KATE:
Is that what that was?

19:49.289 --> 19:52.859
REDFORD:
Well you're alive,
aren't you?

This whole thing
is your fault!

20:17.450 --> 20:18.518
KATE:
(growls)

20:24.491 --> 20:26.426
REDFORD:
This place is known as
the Deep Valley to the locals,

20:26.459 --> 20:28.595
they know it, you can leave your
bags and hire somebody

20:28.628 --> 20:30.797
to come get them.

20:30.830 --> 20:34.334
KATE:
Why don't you just let me ride
on the back of that thing,

20:34.367 --> 20:37.870
and then as soon as we get to
Snowy Pines I will hop off,

20:37.904 --> 20:39.406
I will pay you some money.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.940
REDFORD:
No, I don't want your money.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.609
KATE:
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.278
I should not have
tried to follow you,

20:45.312 --> 20:49.616
but you can't blame a girl for
wanting to get to her wedding

20:49.649 --> 20:53.553
on time, and, and, and now
we're both here and we both

20:53.586 --> 20:56.055
need to get to
Snowy Pines, so--.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.757
REDFORD:
You know what, I have an idea.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.360
Why don't you just
push your wedding.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.561
KATE:
(laughing)

21:01.594 --> 21:03.963
You can't, you can't push a--
you can't push a wedding!

21:03.996 --> 21:07.033
There are guests coming in,
there's flowers that are

21:07.066 --> 21:09.669
supposed to be arriving today,
the venue's been booked

21:09.702 --> 21:11.070
for like a year,
where are you going,

21:11.103 --> 21:12.872
come on.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.341
(whimper)

21:15.207 --> 21:16.108
Will you please
please please please,

21:16.142 --> 21:18.411
will you please just
just take me on your

21:18.445 --> 21:20.313
snow thingy?

21:20.347 --> 21:22.649
You, come on,
you can't just leave me--.

21:22.682 --> 21:23.416
REDFORD: (shouts)
Come on!

21:23.450 --> 21:25.585
Really!?

21:28.455 --> 21:29.522
One bag.

21:29.556 --> 21:30.557
KATE:
One bag.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.424
REDFORD:
No more hitting.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.725
KATE:
No hitting.

21:32.759 --> 21:33.826
REDFORD:
And do us both a favour,
no more talking.

You're the one who insisted,

21:48.975 --> 21:50.943
at considerable
expense I might add,

21:50.977 --> 21:52.879
that the muffs be real fur.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.648
DIANE:
Yes well in your vast experience
in dealing with muffs, dear,

21:55.682 --> 21:57.917
don't you think it's best
to stick to the real thing?

21:57.950 --> 21:59.719
BRAD:
Uh, okay, so here's the latest.

21:59.752 --> 22:03.055
She's on her way here now,
and she's still

22:03.089 --> 22:05.358
riding a snowmobile
with a guy,

22:05.392 --> 22:07.126
but they'll be here in three
days and she says not to

22:07.159 --> 22:09.028
cancel anything.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.930
EDWARD:
Dear Lord.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.766
Do you have any idea
how this affects me?

22:13.800 --> 22:15.435
DIANE:
Yes dear.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.704
It's all about you.

22:20.507 --> 22:21.608
DIANE:
What else?

22:21.641 --> 22:23.476
BRAD:
Just that she's sorry
she's not here yet,

22:23.510 --> 22:26.012
and she knows it's a
major inconvenience,

22:26.045 --> 22:28.548
for you especially.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.418
(***)

22:31.451 --> 22:33.152
BRAD:
Uh...just don't
cancel anything.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.488
She'll deal with whatever's
left when she gets back.

22:35.522 --> 22:36.689
DIANE:
Okay.

22:36.723 --> 22:39.892
I'll um, I'll deal with
the planner.

KATE:
Night.

29:52.892 --> 29:56.428
(owl hooting)

30:00.266 --> 30:08.340
(fire crackling)

30:08.374 --> 30:11.577
(sleeping bag rustling)

30:23.489 --> 30:25.858
(door creaks open and shut)

30:28.060 --> 30:29.561
(***)

30:29.595 --> 30:32.965
REDFORD:
(shivers)

30:35.334 --> 30:37.269
Ohh.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.974
Alright.

30:43.109 --> 30:44.476
(door creaks)

30:47.947 --> 30:51.017
REDFORD:
Ooh, that's cold.

30:53.019 --> 30:55.654
Ohh.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.556
(huffs)

30:57.589 --> 31:05.264
(***)

31:05.297 --> 31:11.603

31:31.623 --> 31:33.059
KATE:
Redford!

31:33.092 --> 31:34.193
Redford!

31:34.226 --> 31:36.128
REDFORD:
Lady, come on!

31:36.162 --> 31:38.497
You couldn't choose a
better time than this?

31:39.065 --> 31:40.232
Ugh!

31:40.266 --> 31:43.335
(door creaks)

31:45.137 --> 31:48.240
TRAPPER:
In or out, cowboy,
you're letting the cold in.

31:48.674 --> 31:52.979
Well, looks like
we got ourselves

31:53.012 --> 31:56.182
a menage a travoir here.

31:56.215 --> 31:59.986
This one here is
yours I suppose?

32:00.019 --> 32:02.354
What do you think
this heres pelt's worth?

32:02.388 --> 32:04.156
REDFORD:
I'm not in the fur business.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.292
TRAPPER:
Well, take a guess.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.327
REDFORD:
I don't speculate.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.429
TRAPPER:
My cabin, my rules, cowboy.

32:10.462 --> 32:13.199
What do you think this pale
quiver in the corner's worth,

32:13.232 --> 32:16.135
in the open market?

32:16.168 --> 32:17.970
REDFORD:
I'm guessing not much.

32:18.004 --> 32:20.539
TRAPPER:
(laughing)

32:20.572 --> 32:22.341
I'm guessing you're right.

32:22.374 --> 32:26.312
You can go, missy.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.014
KATE:
You--I--I can just go?

32:28.047 --> 32:30.082
TRAPPER:
Yeah, go,
get out of here,

32:30.116 --> 32:33.085
get on that machine of yours,
and get the hell out of here

32:33.119 --> 32:35.421
and off my trap line.

32:35.621 --> 32:36.488
REDFORD:
Come on, let's go.

32:36.522 --> 32:37.689
TRAPPER:
Ah-ah!

32:37.723 --> 32:40.359
Not you, cowboy.

32:40.392 --> 32:42.161
You stay put.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.396
KATE:
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

32:44.430 --> 32:45.297
(scoffs)

32:45.331 --> 32:48.167
TRAPPER:
Do I look
like I'm kidding?

32:49.268 --> 32:50.736
KATE:
Yeah, okay.

32:51.737 --> 32:52.638
Oh!

32:52.671 --> 32:54.706
I need the keys.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.276
TRAPPER:
Give her the keys.

32:57.676 --> 32:58.544
(keys jingle)

32:58.577 --> 32:59.678
KATE:
Thanks.

33:01.247 --> 33:03.749
(door opens and shuts)

33:04.683 --> 33:07.986
TRAPPER:
(laughing)

33:08.254 --> 33:10.489
(gargling)

33:10.722 --> 33:12.191
(spitting)

33:12.724 --> 33:13.759
It's harsh.

33:13.792 --> 33:15.994
(laughing)

33:16.728 --> 33:18.697
(snowmobile revving outside)

33:19.398 --> 33:21.033
TRAPPER:
Blrrr.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.502
Ah.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.404
I had a good day today.

33:25.437 --> 33:26.538
Really I did.

33:26.572 --> 33:30.476
But I didn't think it was
gonna turn out this good.

33:30.509 --> 33:33.745
Come on, you got
a pretty mouth.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.814
(laughing)

33:35.847 --> 33:38.784
It's just you and me.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.586
Really cold outside.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.054
Huh?

33:42.088 --> 33:44.223
We're far far away
from everything.

33:44.256 --> 33:45.757
(door clacks)

33:46.592 --> 33:49.261
TRAPPER:
God damn it lady
we had a deal!

33:49.295 --> 33:50.429
(thud)

33:50.462 --> 33:52.231
(crash)

33:52.798 --> 33:54.233
REDFORD:
Let's go, let's go!

33:55.101 --> 34:02.074
(engine idling)

34:02.108 --> 34:02.641
KATE:(mocking)
What's she worth to you?

34:02.674 --> 34:04.110
Oh, not much.

34:04.143 --> 34:05.043
REDFORD:
What are you upset about,

34:05.077 --> 34:06.445
it's not your hide
he was interested in!

34:06.478 --> 34:08.647
KATE:
Ah!

34:12.150 --> 34:13.719
TRAPPER:
Don't go, cowboy!

34:13.752 --> 34:17.556
I got the coonskins in
there if you wanna stay!

34:17.589 --> 34:18.389
Ugh!

34:18.424 --> 34:20.326
(thud)

34:20.792 --> 34:23.161
TRAPPER:
Fox pelts!

34:23.195 --> 34:26.232
Beaver!!

34:26.764 --> 34:28.500
Ugh.

34:28.534 --> 34:30.469
I'm so lonely.

34:31.203 --> 34:43.748
(birds chirping)

34:57.696 --> 35:04.536
(rustling)

35:12.244 --> 35:13.912
REDFORD:
I can't believe that
your heap of a fire

35:13.945 --> 35:15.647
is still burning.

35:15.681 --> 35:18.684
KATE:
Well I can't believe
you left my bags back there.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.887
The one thing we've learned
is to not leave me in charge

35:21.920 --> 35:24.390
of building fires.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.458
REDFORD:
Yeah.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.460
But that looks good on you.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.262
Better on you than me.

35:31.663 --> 35:32.564
KATE:
What a night.

35:32.598 --> 35:35.167
I'm starving.

35:35.934 --> 35:39.171
REDFORD:
There's some
beef jerky in that bag.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.209
KATE:
So?

35:43.242 --> 35:45.277
What's your story?

35:48.347 --> 35:50.216
REDFORD:
Wha...what story?

35:50.249 --> 35:51.450
KATE:
Well I mean you live
out in the middle of nowhere

35:51.483 --> 35:53.452
because...?

35:53.485 --> 35:55.287
REDFORD:
Because it suits me?

35:55.321 --> 35:56.788
KATE:
Okay, well what do you do?

35:56.822 --> 35:58.724
REDFORD:
About what?

35:58.757 --> 36:01.560
KATE:
For a living.

36:03.395 --> 36:04.763
REDFORD:
I don't ask pointless questions,

36:04.796 --> 36:05.797
how about that?

36:05.831 --> 36:06.898
KATE:
Ah, okay.

36:06.932 --> 36:10.336
Well in my experience
guys like you live out--gah,

36:10.369 --> 36:12.938
out in the middle of
nowhere for two reasons.

36:12.971 --> 36:16.308
One is money,
and the other is to be alone,

36:16.342 --> 36:18.477
so I'm guessing
a bit of both with you.

36:18.510 --> 36:23.849
Uh, are you a...oil rigger?

36:23.882 --> 36:26.485
Um, miner?

36:26.518 --> 36:29.388
Construction worker, mechanic?

36:29.421 --> 36:32.791
REDFORD:
No, and why don't you
just stop talking?

36:32.824 --> 36:36.228
KATE:
So we can take
Public Relations off the list?

36:36.262 --> 36:37.796
REDFORD:
(laughing)

36:38.364 --> 36:39.365
And what about you?

36:39.398 --> 36:40.532
KATE:
What about me?

36:40.566 --> 36:41.933
REDFORD:
What's a rich city girl doing
living out in

36:41.967 --> 36:43.669
Sorenson Lake?

36:43.702 --> 36:44.736
KATE:
What?

36:44.770 --> 36:47.473
REDFORD:
Well I mean
you got a $10,000 ring on.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.341
KATE:
Well I didn't buy it.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.510
REDFORD:
Okay, so he's
the rich one, yeah.

36:51.543 --> 36:54.346
KATE:
I teach out here
because I wanna

36:54.380 --> 36:56.715
make the community better.

36:56.748 --> 37:00.619
Helping people
is what matters to me.

37:02.621 --> 37:05.291
It's 15, by the way.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.627
REDFORD:
15 what?

37:08.660 --> 37:10.296
KATE:
The ring.

37:10.329 --> 37:12.564
You were
impressively close though.

37:12.598 --> 37:13.799
REDFORD:
They've gone up in price.

37:13.832 --> 37:16.902
KATE:
Oooh, well there's a
little crack in the armour.

37:16.935 --> 37:19.538
Stoic Redford
bought a diamond,

37:19.571 --> 37:22.341
but I'm guessing not for the
girl you're about to go see.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.943
What's her name?

37:24.976 --> 37:26.678
REDFORD:
Jodi.

37:26.712 --> 37:27.813
KATE:
Jodi.

37:27.846 --> 37:28.747
Hmm.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.783
Does she spell it
with an 'i' or a 'y'?

37:31.817 --> 37:33.785
REDFORD:
With an 'i'.

37:33.819 --> 37:36.254
KATE:
Does she dot her
'i' with a little heart?

37:36.555 --> 37:38.390
She work at Hooters?

37:41.092 --> 37:43.595
I'm sorry,
I'm not being nice.

37:43.629 --> 37:47.633
REDFORD:
It's fine, 'cause nice won't
get you across the river.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.668
KATE:
And being a jerk will?

37:49.701 --> 37:51.837
REDFORD:
I guess we'll see, won't we.

37:52.771 --> 37:55.374
KATE:
(sighs)

37:55.407 --> 38:00.712
(***)

38:00.746 --> 38:02.047
REDFORD:
You...you go
make yourself comfortable.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.549
KATE:
Okay.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.384
REDFORD:
I'll do all the hard work,
that's fine.

38:05.417 --> 38:06.752
KATE:
Okay, thanks.

Stop!

38:32.077 --> 38:33.412
REDFORD:
What, no, we got
ground to cover--.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.780
KATE:
I have to pee.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.515
REDFORD:
No, no, before dark,
if we don't make it--.

38:36.548 --> 38:37.816
KATE:
Okay, it's your jumpsuit,

38:37.849 --> 38:39.418
let's keep going then.

38:39.451 --> 38:40.619
REDFORD:
(sighs)

38:40.652 --> 38:42.120
KATE:
I'll be five minutes.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.455
Less.

38:43.489 --> 38:54.132
(***)

38:54.165 --> 38:57.369

Ugh.

can you help me?

39:12.984 --> 39:14.886
Come on, hurry.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.589
REDFORD:
Come on.

39:20.759 --> 39:21.760
Alright.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.094
KATE:
What are you-- oh, God.

39:23.128 --> 39:27.065
Just...

39:27.098 --> 39:29.668
REDFORD:
Okay.

39:30.936 --> 39:31.903
KATE:
Thanks.

39:31.937 --> 39:32.370
REDFORD:
Think you can
handle it from here?

39:32.404 --> 39:33.705
KATE:
Yeah.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.474
Okay, go away.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.913
Ugh, come on,
you've got to be kidding me.

39:41.947 --> 39:42.614
Ugh.

What are you doing,
get off me!

40:22.688 --> 40:26.091
REDFORD:
Shh, do not move.

KATE:
Well...better some beans
and fruit than us, right?

42:10.361 --> 42:11.830
REDFORD:
I don't think it would have been
much of a question

42:11.863 --> 42:13.665
on which one of us it was.

42:16.101 --> 42:19.771
(sigh)

44:37.242 --> 44:40.779
REDFORD:
We'll have to cross it.

44:40.812 --> 44:44.349
We go around,
it'll add an extra day.

44:44.382 --> 44:47.753
And we don't have the food,
or we'll probably freeze, too.

44:47.786 --> 44:49.254
KATE:
I also have to be
at the church in two days,

44:49.287 --> 44:51.689
so yeah, let's go.

44:52.423 --> 45:01.800
(snow crunching)

45:01.833 --> 45:02.768
REDFORD:
We gotta turn back.

45:02.801 --> 45:03.168
KATE:
What?

45:03.201 --> 45:04.202
Hey, why?

45:04.235 --> 45:06.838
I've seen cars go
across lakes before,

45:06.872 --> 45:08.439
one guy even had a motor home.

45:08.473 --> 45:09.474
(stomps)

45:09.507 --> 45:12.143
It's gotta be like,
two feet of ice under us.

45:12.177 --> 45:14.946
REDFORD:
Yeah, but somewhere between
here and that shore,

45:14.980 --> 45:19.017
this two feet of ice is gonna
go down to a quarter of an inch.

45:20.819 --> 45:22.220
KATE:
I say we cross it.

45:22.253 --> 45:23.789
REDFORD:
Yeah well I didn't ask you.

45:23.822 --> 45:26.958
KATE:
Well I don't wait
to be asked, sometimes.

45:28.059 --> 45:32.263
REDFORD:
Listen, lady, my hide is mine
to lose or save, yours?

45:32.297 --> 45:35.400
See, this is exactly why
I mind my own business.

45:35.433 --> 45:37.535
Now you're my responsibility.

45:37.568 --> 45:41.106
KATE:
I'm not your
responsibility, okay?

45:41.139 --> 45:44.843
I'm a big girl, I decided to
come on this trip.

45:44.876 --> 45:47.378
All I'm saying is,
if you're willing to try,

45:47.412 --> 45:50.982
then I'm willing to try.

45:51.016 --> 45:56.888
(***)

45:56.922 --> 45:59.157
REDFORD:
You realize if we go through,

45:59.190 --> 46:00.792
there's no going back.

46:00.826 --> 46:02.994
KATE:
Yes, I realize that.

46:03.028 --> 46:06.397
(***)

46:06.431 --> 46:07.899
REDFORD:
Okay.

46:07.933 --> 46:09.935
KATE:
Okay.

46:09.968 --> 46:11.436
It'll be fine.

46:11.469 --> 46:13.504
Come on.

46:13.538 --> 46:15.240
You're so pessimistic.

46:22.313 --> 46:24.015
EDWARD:
Hey.

46:24.049 --> 46:26.584
BRAD:
Hi, Edward.

46:26.617 --> 46:30.088
EDWARD:
I know, Brad,
that you're sick with worry,

46:30.121 --> 46:32.357
I know exactly how you feel.

46:32.390 --> 46:34.092
BRAD:
I don't know what to do.

46:34.125 --> 46:35.861
I was thinking maybe we should
send out a search party,

46:35.894 --> 46:38.029
or something?

46:38.063 --> 46:39.364
EDWARD:
We've been through a lot,

46:39.397 --> 46:41.566
you and me.

46:41.599 --> 46:47.305
I think it's time I show you
a special little something.

46:48.573 --> 46:50.175
I learned this along
the way, go ahead,

46:50.208 --> 46:51.877
take your socks
off, come on now.

46:51.910 --> 46:55.080
Okay.

46:55.113 --> 46:56.948
Now see,
some men prefer scotch,

46:56.982 --> 47:00.185
other men prefer golf.

47:00.218 --> 47:04.189
Even others prefer the,
well the company of prostitutes.

47:04.222 --> 47:08.193
I'm gonna show you my little
secret that I use every time

47:08.226 --> 47:10.261
I just can't take it anymore.

47:10.295 --> 47:12.931
Now put your feet
flat on this carpet,

47:12.964 --> 47:17.268
and now, take a breath,
and try to pick it up with your

47:17.302 --> 47:19.404
toes as you exhale.

47:19.437 --> 47:20.906
(inhale)

47:20.939 --> 47:24.175
(sigh)

47:24.976 --> 47:26.411
(inhale)

47:26.444 --> 47:30.348
You see?

47:30.381 --> 47:34.285
Di thinks I made this up but
I actually saw it in a movie.

47:34.319 --> 47:37.088
(laughing)

47:37.122 --> 47:38.423
BRAD:
This is really good.

47:38.456 --> 47:42.527
EDWARD:
Mm.

47:42.560 --> 47:45.096
DIANE:
Poor Kate.

47:51.069 --> 47:56.674
(***)

47:56.707 --> 47:59.510
REDFORD:
You need to stay at least
four feet back, alright?

47:59.544 --> 48:01.646
KATE:
Okay, Mr Know-It-All.

48:01.679 --> 48:04.349
So, let me guess,
are you a nature guy?

48:04.382 --> 48:05.383
No.

48:05.416 --> 48:08.086
Handyman?

48:08.119 --> 48:09.955
Janitor?

48:09.988 --> 48:11.489
Garbage collector?

48:11.522 --> 48:12.958
REDFORD:
You really have a low
opinion of me,

48:12.991 --> 48:14.425
don't you lady?

48:14.459 --> 48:18.029
KATE:
Skate sharpener,
professional snowshoe-er,

48:18.063 --> 48:19.130
birthday clown.

48:19.164 --> 48:20.698
REDFORD:
If I tell you
will you please shut up!?

48:20.731 --> 48:22.633
KATE:
Yes!

48:22.667 --> 48:24.502
REDFORD:
Fine.

48:24.535 --> 48:28.173
I spend my time
in the woods, quietly,

48:28.206 --> 48:29.640
avoiding women like you--.

48:29.674 --> 48:32.043
(crackling)

48:32.077 --> 48:33.611
KATE:
Redford.

48:33.644 --> 48:34.980
Redford?!

48:35.013 --> 48:36.114
Redford, listen,
the ice is cracking!

48:36.147 --> 48:36.982
Ah!

48:37.015 --> 48:38.950
(splash)

48:38.984 --> 48:44.589
(splashing)

48:44.622 --> 48:46.624
KATE:
(gasping)

48:55.633 --> 48:57.268
REDFORD:
Oh my God.

48:57.302 --> 48:58.236
Get up.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.071
(gasping)

49:00.105 --> 49:06.711
(splashing)

49:06.744 --> 49:08.479
REDFORD:
Okay.

49:08.513 --> 49:11.049
Get up, come on,
we gotta get up.

49:11.082 --> 49:12.517
We gotta go.

49:12.550 --> 49:15.153
We gotta get dry.

49:15.186 --> 49:17.122
Come on.

49:17.155 --> 49:27.098
KATE:
(whimpering)

49:27.132 --> 49:28.099
REDFORD:
Here we are.

49:28.133 --> 49:32.603
(gasping)

49:32.637 --> 49:34.172
KATE:
Redford?

49:34.205 --> 49:38.443
Redford, come on.

49:39.510 --> 49:40.511
Okay.

49:40.545 --> 49:43.481
Light a fire.

49:44.282 --> 49:45.250
Light a fire.

49:45.283 --> 49:46.517
Okay.

49:47.652 --> 49:51.456
REDFORD:
(groaning)

49:51.489 --> 49:57.062
KATE:
(gasping)

49:57.095 --> 50:07.505
REDFORD:
(grunting)

50:07.538 --> 50:09.207
(gasping)

50:09.240 --> 50:12.377
KATE:
Okay, come on.

50:14.745 --> 50:15.446
Ah!

50:15.480 --> 50:18.583
REDFORD:
I'm so cold, so cold...

50:19.417 --> 50:21.052
KATE:
Okay, I got this.

50:21.086 --> 50:22.453
Oh.

50:25.423 --> 50:27.058
REDFORD:
Get a fire going.

50:27.092 --> 50:36.101
(***)

50:36.134 --> 50:38.769
KATE:
Come on.

50:38.803 --> 50:44.675
REDFORD:
So cold.

50:44.709 --> 50:46.177
KATE:
Ugh.

50:50.348 --> 50:51.449
(strikes match)

50:51.482 --> 51:01.492
(***)

51:01.526 --> 51:09.334
(***)

51:09.367 --> 51:12.670
KATE:
Okay, come on, come on,
I got a fire going.

51:12.703 --> 51:14.872
Come on,
let's go.

51:14.905 --> 51:21.812
(***)

51:21.846 --> 51:25.583
(fire crackling)

51:25.616 --> 51:29.254
REDFORD:
You did good.

51:29.287 --> 51:30.788
Thank you.

51:37.528 --> 51:39.130
CINDY:
Hi.

51:39.164 --> 51:40.665
BRAD:
This is insane.

51:40.698 --> 51:42.867
I don't know where she is,
when she's gonna be back,

51:42.900 --> 51:45.470
if she's gonna be back,
or even if she's still alive

51:45.503 --> 51:47.372
you know sometimes I think
she does these things to me

51:47.405 --> 51:49.507
on purpose I mean
how am I supposed to--.

51:49.540 --> 51:50.675
CINDY:
You're tense.

51:50.708 --> 51:52.610
BRAD:
Oh, God that's good.

51:52.643 --> 51:54.279
CINDY:
You need to relax.

51:54.312 --> 51:55.413
BRAD:
Yeah.

51:55.446 --> 51:56.281
(gulp)

51:56.314 --> 51:58.549
You're right,
I just need to relax.

51:58.583 --> 52:02.387
Woah, woah hey, ha,
maybe not that relaxed.

52:02.420 --> 52:04.422
CINDY:
Brad, you're almost family.

52:04.455 --> 52:07.425
What could be more right
than comforting each other

52:07.458 --> 52:09.760
in our hour of need?

52:09.794 --> 52:11.896
BRAD:
I, Cindy, I don't think
Kate would go for this.

52:11.929 --> 52:15.500
CINDY:
Are you saying that my sister
is selfish enough

52:15.533 --> 52:19.404
to deprive her husband-to-be
of solace when she herself

52:19.437 --> 52:21.372
has gone missing?

52:21.406 --> 52:24.775
BRAD:
Oh, you make a good point.

52:25.943 --> 52:28.179
No, this isn't right.

52:28.213 --> 52:31.416
CINDY:
Besides, would Kate do this.

52:33.418 --> 52:35.420
BRAD:
Oh, oh my God,
don't do that, ha.

52:35.453 --> 52:36.687
CINDY:
(giggles)

52:36.721 --> 52:38.423
Are you gonna stop me?

52:38.456 --> 52:42.493
BRAD:
Oh, oh.

52:42.527 --> 52:43.428
(thud)

52:43.461 --> 52:44.595
CINDY:
Ahh!

52:44.629 --> 52:46.464
BRAD:
Oh my God,
I am so sorry,

52:46.497 --> 52:49.300
are you, here,
let me just--.

52:49.334 --> 52:50.635
CINDY:
Ow!!

52:50.668 --> 52:51.802
(crying)

52:51.836 --> 52:53.671
BRAD:
I think it might be broken.

52:55.473 --> 52:56.974
CINDY:
(screams)

52:57.007 --> 52:59.310
(running)

52:59.510 --> 53:00.945
BRAD:
Sorry.

53:06.884 --> 53:11.589
REDFORD:
Alright, put that up there
like that,

53:11.622 --> 53:12.957
and you can just spin around.

53:12.990 --> 53:13.958
KATE:
Excuse me?

53:13.991 --> 53:14.992
What are you--.

53:15.025 --> 53:16.327
(zip)

53:16.361 --> 53:17.328
KATE:
Oh.

53:17.362 --> 53:19.564
REDFORD:
If we leave the fire
in damp clothes,

53:19.597 --> 53:23.234
we'll freeze
in a matter of hours.

53:23.268 --> 53:27.872
Don't worry,
you'll be next.

53:27.905 --> 53:30.308
KATE:
Uh, yeah, you wish.

53:30.341 --> 53:32.677
REDFORD:
You ain't got nothin'
I haven't seen before.

53:32.710 --> 53:34.945
KATE:
How do you know
what I have and haven't got?

53:34.979 --> 53:39.684
REDFORD:
Basic anatomy.

53:40.818 --> 53:45.790
You should probably allow
an inch or so for shrinkage,

53:45.823 --> 53:46.724
probably two.

53:46.757 --> 53:48.493
KATE:
Oh.

53:48.526 --> 53:50.295
What is it with men?

53:50.328 --> 53:54.399
You're just always obsessed
with measuring your peens.

53:54.432 --> 53:57.402
REDFORD:
Right, and you women
aren't worried

53:57.435 --> 53:59.437
about your cup sizes, huh?

53:59.470 --> 54:02.273
Earlier I had you pegged
for an ample B,

54:02.307 --> 54:04.041
but now I'm thinking
maybe a small B.

54:04.074 --> 54:06.911
KATE:
Uh, excuse me,
I am a full B,

54:06.944 --> 54:08.646
thank you very much.

54:08.679 --> 54:12.417
REDFORD:
Right, well I'll believe that
when I see it.

54:12.450 --> 54:14.552
KATE:
Well, dream on.

54:14.585 --> 54:16.887
REDFORD:
Okay.

54:16.921 --> 54:21.826
(***)

54:21.859 --> 54:23.328
KATE:
Ugh.

54:24.329 --> 54:27.732
(zip)

54:27.765 --> 54:37.007
(rustling)

54:37.041 --> 54:44.315
(***)

54:44.349 --> 54:46.584
KATE:
Don't turn around.

54:46.617 --> 54:51.589
(rustling)

54:51.622 --> 54:55.426
(***)

54:55.460 --> 55:03.100
KATE:
So I should probably say...
that you were right.

55:03.133 --> 55:05.069
And I was wrong.

55:05.102 --> 55:06.904
And I'm sorry.

55:06.937 --> 55:08.706
REDFORD:
Don't be sorry.

55:08.739 --> 55:10.675
I would have done it
wether or not you were with me,

55:10.708 --> 55:13.378
so I'm sorry.

55:13.411 --> 55:18.115
(***)

55:18.148 --> 55:22.953
KATE:
Well, this is awkward.

55:22.987 --> 55:25.956
REDFORD:
Yes.

55:25.990 --> 55:27.625
Yes it is.

55:31.862 --> 55:33.698
(intercom beeps)

55:33.731 --> 55:35.132
WOMAN:
Dr Till to admission.

55:35.165 --> 55:38.369
Dr Till to admission.

55:40.004 --> 55:41.572
EDWARD:
Ohh.

55:42.106 --> 55:44.609
(kiss)

55:45.109 --> 55:46.444
(pat)

55:52.683 --> 55:54.419
(cellphone rings)

55:54.452 --> 55:55.553
EDWARD:
It's Katie!

55:55.586 --> 55:57.922
(cellphone ringging)

55:57.955 --> 55:58.756
EDWARD:
No, your pants are ringing!

55:58.789 --> 56:01.759
BRAD:
Let me-- I-- oh!

56:01.792 --> 56:02.993
(clatter)

56:03.027 --> 56:04.895
(thudding)

56:04.929 --> 56:08.499
(phone ringing)

56:08.533 --> 56:09.734
BRAD:
Kate?

56:09.767 --> 56:11.836
EDWARD:
Hi Katie, it's dad.

56:13.604 --> 56:15.540
BRAD:
Of course I'd be
interested in a free trip

56:15.573 --> 56:17.775
to the Bahamas.

56:26.016 --> 56:29.620
(bubbles gurgling)

56:29.654 --> 56:31.121
REDFORD:
(gasps)

56:31.155 --> 56:34.525
I can't see nothin'.

56:35.025 --> 56:44.835
(snow crunching)

56:45.736 --> 56:46.904
(slap)

56:47.472 --> 56:49.006
(zip)

56:50.741 --> 56:53.077
REDFORD:
I'm goin' in.

56:53.110 --> 56:55.546
KATE:
Any excuse to get naked.

56:55.580 --> 57:00.117
Okay, 'kay, can you just
leave your underwear on, please?

57:00.150 --> 57:03.087
I don't want to see any
dangly bits if you need

57:03.120 --> 57:04.188
rescuing.

57:04.221 --> 57:04.855
REDFORD:
Yeah?

57:04.889 --> 57:05.856
You sure?

57:09.494 --> 57:12.530
KATE:
Ugh.

57:15.900 --> 57:16.667
REDFORD:
Ah.

57:16.701 --> 57:18.736
KATE:
Wait wait wait wait wait.

57:18.769 --> 57:21.939
REDFORD:
What?

57:24.141 --> 57:26.076
What, come on lady,
it's freezing out here!

57:26.110 --> 57:28.012
KATE:
Okay, can you stop it,
with the 'lady' thing?

57:28.045 --> 57:29.947
I know you're
trying to be a big man,

57:29.980 --> 57:34.652
and everything, but
it's a little demeaning, just...

57:34.685 --> 57:37.988
come back, okay?

57:38.022 --> 57:39.824
REDFORD:
Yeah well if I don't
get food or more clothes,

57:39.857 --> 57:42.560
I might as well
not come back, so.

57:42.993 --> 57:44.595
KATE:
Okay, well, give 'er.

57:44.629 --> 57:46.230
REDFORD:
Thanks.

57:47.998 --> 57:50.668
(splash)

57:56.974 --> 58:05.550
(fire crackling)

58:05.583 --> 58:07.518
KATE:
Ah, okay.

58:10.788 --> 58:12.757
REDFORD:
Hmm.

58:15.593 --> 58:18.863
Would you like a piece
of my dehydrated banana?

58:18.896 --> 58:21.031
KATE:
What do you think Jodi
would say about that?

58:21.065 --> 58:24.902
REDFORD:
I'm sure she'd say
'better you than me.'

58:26.136 --> 58:30.007
KATE:
Well she sounds
like a special lady.

58:30.040 --> 58:34.011
REDFORD:
That she is.

58:36.013 --> 58:38.015
KATE:
Well, we have some clothes,

58:38.048 --> 58:44.154
we have some food, and...

58:44.188 --> 58:47.725
REDFORD:
Ah-ah, that is not for you.

58:47.758 --> 58:50.728
KATE:
Redford, I didn't know
you knew how to read,

58:50.761 --> 58:52.997
and Emmerson no less, huh.

58:53.030 --> 58:55.766
REDFORD:
Yeah, there's a lot of things
that I know how to do

58:55.800 --> 58:58.068
that you don't know about.

58:58.102 --> 58:59.369
KATE:
Okay.

58:59.403 --> 59:01.038
REDFORD:
You know, you'll get yourself
into trouble some day

59:01.071 --> 59:03.874
if you keep thinking
you know more than you do.

59:06.711 --> 59:09.580
KATE:
To be great
is to be misunderstood,

59:09.614 --> 59:12.082
is that it?

59:12.116 --> 59:15.953
REDFORD:
None of us will ever
accomplish anything excellent

59:15.986 --> 59:21.759
or commanding, except he
who listens to the whisper,

59:21.792 --> 59:24.695
which is heard by him alone.

59:24.729 --> 59:25.696
KATE:
Hmm.

59:25.730 --> 59:28.132
That's nice.

59:28.165 --> 59:31.235
I haven't heard that one before,
I'm impressed.

59:31.268 --> 59:34.004
REDFORD:
And what were you expecting?

59:34.038 --> 59:37.742
KATE:
Oh, I don't know,
maybe a little Louis L'Amour.

59:37.775 --> 59:39.276
REDFORD:
I like Louis L'Amour.

59:39.309 --> 59:40.277
KATE:
You do!

59:40.310 --> 59:41.679
Surprise surprise.

59:41.712 --> 59:43.180
(laughing)

59:43.213 --> 59:48.285
REDFORD:
I suppose you're all
Margaret Atwood-y, huh?

59:48.318 --> 59:49.887
Oh woman is woe--.

59:49.920 --> 59:51.856
KATE:
You know
Margaret Atwood isn't all--.

59:51.889 --> 59:54.158
REDFORD:
Oh, I'm sure when
no one's looking you're watching

59:54.191 --> 59:55.926
Sex in the City re-runs.

59:59.329 --> 01:00:00.765
KATE:
Heh.

01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:03.367
You know, I have to say
I'm a little surprised

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.936
that you know who
Margaret Atwood even is.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:07.071
REDFORD:
Yeah?

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:08.939
Well it's really gonna
break you off when I tell you

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:10.841
I prefer Margaret Laurence.

01:00:10.875 --> 01:00:13.410
KATE:
'Break you off'?

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:16.814
You can't talk about
female authors

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:18.415
all intelligently and then say
something like

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.284
'break you off.'

01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:22.753
You lose all
ground that way.

01:00:22.787 --> 01:00:24.755
REDFORD:
I was...

01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:26.156
I was making ground?

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:27.792
KATE:
No.

01:00:27.825 --> 01:00:28.358
REDFORD:
(laughing)

01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:30.060
Oh, I think I was.

01:00:30.094 --> 01:00:31.095
KATE:
Well you weren't.

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:32.730
REDFORD:
I think I was.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.969
KATE:
How long do you think
we could survive out here?

01:00:39.804 --> 01:00:42.707
REDFORD:
I don't know.

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:46.176
But I don't get the
feeling that I'm about to die.

01:00:48.445 --> 01:00:51.716
I think if uh...

01:00:51.749 --> 01:00:55.986
if we stick together,
we stand a pretty good shot.

01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:08.966
(***)

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:17.207
(birds chirping)

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:27.251
(***)

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:34.959
(***)

01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:37.327
REDFORD:
(grunts)

01:01:40.765 --> 01:01:44.301
(grunting)

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:47.237
(sighs)

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:53.043
KATE:
Mm.

01:01:53.077 --> 01:01:55.379
REDFORD:
Good morning.

01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:57.414
KATE:
Morning.

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:59.349
(yawn)

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:02.186
REDFORD:
(grunts)

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:03.988
Okay.

01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:11.428
(twigs snap)

01:02:27.812 --> 01:02:29.379
REDFORD:
Ugh.

01:02:30.147 --> 01:02:34.251
Ohh yeah.

01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:36.253
KATE:
What are you doing?

01:02:38.455 --> 01:02:39.790
REDFORD:
You gotta try this.

01:02:39.824 --> 01:02:41.558
KATE:
Yeah, no, I don't.

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.293
REDFORD:
Oh come on.

01:02:43.327 --> 01:02:46.496
Live in the sunshine,
swim the sea,

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:48.999
drink the wild air.

01:02:49.033 --> 01:02:50.034
KATE:
(laughing)

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:51.435
No thanks.

01:02:51.468 --> 01:02:54.571
REDFORD:
What, you don't wash your face
in the morning?

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.306
KATE:
Yeah I wash my face.

01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:00.945
With glycolic acid cleanser
for sensitive skin,

01:03:00.978 --> 01:03:04.248
and warm shower water.

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.183
REDFORD:
Oh, no,
no no no no no.

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:06.917
KATE:
No?

01:03:06.951 --> 01:03:07.384
REDFORD:
No.

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:08.385
KATE:
Why no?

01:03:08.418 --> 01:03:09.920
REDFORD:
Cold showers
are the only way to go.

01:03:09.954 --> 01:03:11.288
KATE:
Yeah.

01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:14.158
Bet you need a lot
of cold showers.

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:15.492
Ooh.

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:17.127
(laughing)

01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:19.129
REDFORD:
And your fiance,
does he enjoy

01:03:19.163 --> 01:03:21.031
glycolic sensitive skin--.

01:03:21.065 --> 01:03:22.166
KATE:
Get out of my way.

01:03:22.199 --> 01:03:24.501
Oh God.

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:27.171
Ohh-ho-ho
this is so cold.

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:31.275
Oh my God.

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:32.342
Oh, uh.

01:03:32.376 --> 01:03:34.111
That'll wake you up.

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:35.545
REDFORD:
I think, I think you probably
missed a spot.

01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:36.613
KATE:
No no no, I didn't miss--

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:37.447
(squeal)

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:38.582
(laughing)

01:03:38.615 --> 01:03:40.250
Don't.

01:03:42.019 --> 01:03:43.921
REDFORD:
Alright, okay.

01:03:43.954 --> 01:03:46.256
Showers are over.

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:48.458
KATE:
So what's for
breakfast big man?

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:52.162
REDFORD:
Well it definitely
won't be eggs and toast.

01:03:52.196 --> 01:03:55.132
KATE:
Well that's okay 'cause
I don't like eggs and toast.

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:58.002
REDFORD:
Oh good.

01:03:58.035 --> 01:04:00.204
'cause there is no food.

01:04:00.237 --> 01:04:02.472
KATE:
You mean there's nothing?

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:04.374
REDFORD:
No.

01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:05.943
KATE:
Well, that's not good.

01:04:05.976 --> 01:04:07.177
REDFORD:
Especially when we're
planning on crossing

01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:10.214
the Snowy Pines Plain on foot.

01:04:10.247 --> 01:04:11.916
KATE:
Sounds to me like you
didn't plan that one out

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:14.518
very well there,
nature boy.

01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:17.621
REDFORD:
What?

01:04:17.654 --> 01:04:19.323
Ohh, you are--.

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:20.457
KATE:
Don't.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:22.092
REDFORD:
Come here.

01:04:22.126 --> 01:04:22.993
Come here.

01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:24.328
KATE:
(laughing)

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:25.029
Stop!

01:04:25.062 --> 01:04:35.072
(***)

01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:44.248
(***)

01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:49.519
* There's a longing of sorts
for the souls of Manhattan *

01:04:49.553 --> 01:04:55.092
* but I don't see
what they all see *

01:04:55.125 --> 01:05:00.664
* I knew a good girl
with the slightest of curls *

01:05:00.697 --> 01:05:06.136
* who was bound
for the land of the free *

* She left in the morn
from so empty a home*

01:05:34.498 --> 01:05:40.270
* with a hope that the city
would fill *

01:05:40.304 --> 01:05:45.709
* she made souvenirs from a
notepad and tears *

(***)

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:53.117
REDFORD:
Come on, Kate.

01:05:53.150 --> 01:06:00.157
* --treat it too fast, at the
drop of a hat you can--*

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:01.225
REDFORD:
Come on, Kate, stay with me.

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:03.360
KATE:
I don't think I can
take another step.

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:04.761
REDFORD:
Just a few more steps,

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:10.067
come on, come on,
we can do this.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:20.110
(***)

01:06:20.144 --> 01:06:30.154

* And the sun does rise up over
the silver horizon *

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:43.367
REDFORD:
We're just over there.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.634
KATE:
Okay.

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:50.707
* 'Cause she's lower than Hell
and she needs a good friend *

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:56.680

REDFORD:
Okay.

01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:23.173
Looks like rig watch.

01:07:23.207 --> 01:07:27.477
There's probably only one
camp attendant left behind.

01:07:27.511 --> 01:07:31.248
I'll steal us some wheels,
you steal us some food.

01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:32.149
KATE:
(scoffs)

01:07:32.182 --> 01:07:34.184
Yeah, okay, I'm not
stealing anything,

01:07:34.218 --> 01:07:37.754
let's just go in there
and ask them for a ride.

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:41.425
REDFORD:
Don't you have some place
you need to be tomorrow?

01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:45.095
'Cause I know I do.

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:48.332
KATE:
(sighs)

01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:50.667
REDFORD:
Okay, right, they're gonna
shut down at the cost of

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.236
tens of thousands of dollars
just so they can give us

01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:53.403
a ride back into town.

01:07:53.437 --> 01:07:55.639
We'd probably have to wait
a few days for the next guy

01:07:55.672 --> 01:07:57.641
to show up and then
go in to town with him.

01:07:57.674 --> 01:07:58.642
KATE:
Okay, well
I'm not doing that,

01:07:58.675 --> 01:08:00.210
that's ridiculous.

01:08:00.244 --> 01:08:01.845
Just...

01:08:01.878 --> 01:08:03.180
leave it up to me.

01:08:03.213 --> 01:08:05.849
I will get us...home.

Yeah right.

Hello?

(***)

01:08:37.714 --> 01:08:40.850
KATE:
Just gonna
grab some stuff.

a naked rig worker,

01:20:51.948 --> 01:20:53.549
DIANE:
Yeah, they are.

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:56.019
It's almost disturbing.

01:20:56.052 --> 01:20:58.421
KATE:
So, what happened
to Cindy's face?

01:20:58.454 --> 01:20:59.956
DIANE:
Oh, I don't know.

01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:04.894
But as usual
her timing's impeccable.

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:06.930
Did you get enough sleep?

01:21:06.963 --> 01:21:08.364
KATE:
Mmhmm.

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.036
DIANE:
Liar.

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:15.371
You know, I seldom
worry about you,

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:20.309
but this time, I must say,
I'm glad you're here.

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:25.281
You are here, aren't you?

01:21:25.314 --> 01:21:26.916
KATE:
Of course.

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:31.554
DIANE:
Does this have anything to do
with the adventurer who

01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:36.092
led you out of Egypt or Canin
or wherever it was you were?

01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:37.460
KATE:
No.

01:21:42.431 --> 01:21:43.566
Maybe.

01:21:44.467 --> 01:21:46.302
DIANE:
Kate.

01:21:46.335 --> 01:21:49.005
In less than six hours you're
going to make a promise

01:21:49.038 --> 01:21:52.942
to love, honour, and obey Brad
as long as you both shall live.

01:21:52.976 --> 01:21:56.245
After having been through
the adventures

01:21:56.279 --> 01:21:59.215
you've been through
over the past few days,

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:01.617
I can understand
it may not be something

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:04.087
one wants to jump right into.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:09.325
If you wanna postpone
this afternoon and just leave it

01:22:09.358 --> 01:22:15.098
for another day, I would find it
quite a reasonable thing to do.

01:22:15.464 --> 01:22:18.401
KATE:
I'm afraid I don't have
a very good grip

01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:22.005
on reasonable right now.

01:22:22.038 --> 01:22:24.407
DIANE:
Well that's why you have me.

01:22:24.607 --> 01:22:26.475
KATE:
Thanks mom.

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:35.051
Did you have any second thoughts
about marrying dad?

01:22:35.084 --> 01:22:35.618
DIANE:
Ha!

01:22:35.651 --> 01:22:37.286
Of course I did.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:40.056
He's insane.

01:22:40.089 --> 01:22:42.591
But he's what I really wanted.

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:47.296
Make sure that Brad's
what you really want.

01:22:49.232 --> 01:22:51.234
KATE:
I think he is.

01:22:58.441 --> 01:23:02.511
DIANE:
Does this adventurer
have a name?

01:23:02.545 --> 01:23:05.181
KATE:
Redford.

01:23:05.214 --> 01:23:07.250
McMillan.

01:23:07.283 --> 01:23:08.751
DIANE:
Redford McMillan?

01:23:08.784 --> 01:23:10.019
KATE:
Mmhmm.

01:23:10.053 --> 01:23:11.687
DIANE:
Like the author?

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.855
KATE:
What author?

01:23:12.888 --> 01:23:14.523
DIANE:
Well it's not like he's
on the best selling list

01:23:14.557 --> 01:23:17.193
or anything,
but I really like his work.

01:23:17.226 --> 01:23:23.266
"As in all things,
the blessings of nature abound."

01:23:27.103 --> 01:23:30.273
No.

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:33.109
Lucky girl.

01:23:33.142 --> 01:23:34.343
KATE:
Mom.

01:23:34.377 --> 01:23:36.612
DIANE:
I'm just saying.

01:23:37.113 --> 01:23:39.348
You know, there's a McMillan
residence across the street

01:23:39.382 --> 01:23:41.084
from my office.

01:23:43.219 --> 01:23:44.687

Sorry.

So sorry to disturb you.

01:23:53.129 --> 01:23:54.163
DRIVER:
Straight to the church then?

01:23:54.197 --> 01:23:55.798
DIANE:
Yes, thank you.

01:23:55.831 --> 01:24:10.279

Actually, can we
make a quick detour first?

01:24:19.122 --> 01:24:21.124

Yeah, okay.

Hi.

WOMAN:
Hello.

01:24:30.466 --> 01:24:34.637
KATE:
Um, I'm looking for Redford?

01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:37.273
WOMAN:
Redford's my son.

01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:38.574
I'm Jodi.

01:24:38.607 --> 01:24:43.746

01:24:43.779 --> 01:24:45.314
JODI:
Big day, huh?

01:24:45.348 --> 01:24:49.084
KATE:
Uh, yeah,
today's the big day.

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:52.821
Uh, is Redford--.

01:24:52.855 --> 01:24:54.557
JODI:
He's just stepped out.

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:56.292
KATE:
Okay.

01:24:57.193 --> 01:24:58.461
JODI:
You're Kate, right?

01:24:58.494 --> 01:25:00.429
KATE:
Yeah, that's me.

01:25:00.463 --> 01:25:03.199
JODI:
That was quite the adventure
you had getting down here.

01:25:03.232 --> 01:25:04.767
Redford told me all about it.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.769
KATE:
So he came to see you.

01:25:06.802 --> 01:25:08.871
JODI:
He's never missed my birthday.

01:25:08.904 --> 01:25:12.141
KATE:
That's sweet.

01:25:12.675 --> 01:25:13.742
JODI:
Redford should be back soon,

01:25:13.776 --> 01:25:15.478
I'm not sure where he is.

01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:18.781
He likes to mind
his own business.

01:25:18.814 --> 01:25:20.716
KATE:
Yes he does.

01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:23.519
Um, I really
have to get going.

01:25:23.552 --> 01:25:27.523
But you should know that
your son saved my life,

01:25:27.556 --> 01:25:30.193
like, 20 times.

01:25:30.226 --> 01:25:33.396
He's a really good man.

01:25:33.429 --> 01:25:34.897
JODI:
He is.

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:36.499
Most of the time.

01:25:36.532 --> 01:25:37.666
KATE:
Most of the time.

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.668
You're right.

01:25:40.569 --> 01:25:44.240
Can I ask you,
who's the little girl?

01:25:44.273 --> 01:25:47.443
JODI:
Oh, that's...

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:50.479
that's a complicated story.

01:25:52.681 --> 01:25:55.651
(children chattering)

01:25:55.684 --> 01:25:57.753
REDFORD:
That's really good, Alice.

01:25:57.786 --> 01:26:01.357
You're such a good colourer,
and you're getting to be so big.

01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:03.192
ALICE:
Thanks!

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:06.262
BRITANNY:
Alice, why don't you go
play on the slides

01:26:06.295 --> 01:26:07.796
in the play room?

01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:09.532
Mummy and Mr McMillan have
some things they need to

01:26:09.565 --> 01:26:10.966
talk about in private.

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:14.703
ALICE:
Okay mommy.

01:26:18.441 --> 01:26:19.875
REDFORD:
Mr McMillan?

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:21.310
Really?

01:26:21.344 --> 01:26:23.946
That's a bit cold,
even for you.

01:26:23.979 --> 01:26:24.980
BRITANNY:
I don't know what to call you,

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:26.782
you're not her father.

01:26:26.815 --> 01:26:31.186
REDFORD:
I was her father,
for three years.

01:26:34.923 --> 01:26:37.693
She seems to be doing well.

01:26:37.726 --> 01:26:38.894
How are you?

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:40.596
BRITANNY:
Good.

01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:42.231
We're really good.

01:26:42.265 --> 01:26:44.833
REDFORD:
I'm happy for you.

01:26:44.867 --> 01:26:47.736
BRITANNY:
I was surprised.

01:26:47.770 --> 01:26:50.739
Shocked, actually,
to hear from you.

01:26:50.773 --> 01:26:54.343
REDFORD:
I thought maybe it was time.

01:26:54.377 --> 01:26:57.780
BRITANNY:
I guess I at least owe you
that much.

01:27:00.416 --> 01:27:03.452
You know, I'm really sorry
for the way everything

01:27:03.486 --> 01:27:05.821
turned out.

01:27:05.854 --> 01:27:08.891
It was never about you.

01:27:09.325 --> 01:27:12.027
Redford, I never thought
he was coming back.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.463
REDFORD:
I know.

01:27:14.497 --> 01:27:16.599
I know.

01:27:16.632 --> 01:27:18.534
And I'm sorry.

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:20.769
For the way I handled things.

01:27:20.803 --> 01:27:22.538
I truly am.

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.409
BRITANNY:
How are you?

01:27:27.009 --> 01:27:33.316
REDFORD:
Uhh, you know, I'm fine.

01:27:33.349 --> 01:27:35.584
BRITANNY:
What's her name?

01:27:35.618 --> 01:27:38.621
REDFORD:
Whose name?

01:27:40.989 --> 01:27:44.927
She's with someone,
and it's none of my business.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.564
BRITANNY:
You made me
your business when I wasn't.

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:55.338
We're not all the same.

01:27:55.371 --> 01:27:56.572
REDFORD:
(sighs)

01:27:57.506 --> 01:27:59.442
(***)

01:27:59.475 --> 01:28:00.543
WEDDING PLANNER:
That.

01:28:00.576 --> 01:28:03.045
EDWARD:
I'll take that.

01:28:05.414 --> 01:28:06.615
(kiss)

01:28:06.649 --> 01:28:07.950
EDWARD:
Okay, see you in there.

01:28:13.088 --> 01:28:15.891
Katie, you look beautiful.

01:28:15.924 --> 01:28:17.326
KATE:
I need to talk to Brad.

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.662
EDWARD:
Well, he's just
a few steps away,

01:28:19.695 --> 01:28:22.398
and you can talk to him
as much as you want then.

01:28:22.765 --> 01:28:23.832
Ready?

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:27.570
(doors creak)

01:28:28.437 --> 01:28:31.540

hanging on *

01:28:31.574 --> 01:28:35.711

01:28:35.744 --> 01:28:40.449
* I think back to the stories

01:28:40.483 --> 01:28:44.420
* mothers with their
hearts of gold, *

01:28:44.453 --> 01:28:47.723

hearts of gold *

01:29:03.572 --> 01:29:06.942
PASTOR:
Please be seated.

01:29:08.944 --> 01:29:10.679
Dearly beloved.

01:29:10.713 --> 01:29:13.449
We are gathered here
in the presence of God

01:29:13.482 --> 01:29:19.922
and these witnesses, to sanctify
the joining of Brad and Kate

01:29:19.955 --> 01:29:22.591
in Holy matrimony.

01:29:24.593 --> 01:29:30.933
Marriage is commendable
in the eyes of God.

01:29:30.966 --> 01:29:36.805
Kate, Brad,
as you move forward,

01:29:36.839 --> 01:29:42.678
may you look forward to each
new season of your marriage,

01:29:42.711 --> 01:29:46.014
much as the world looks
forward to the new seasons

01:29:46.048 --> 01:29:51.186
of the year, for each season
brings with it new moments,

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:53.789
memories.

01:29:53.822 --> 01:29:59.027
The key to a good marriage
is to have a strong bond,

01:29:59.061 --> 01:30:03.832
friendship, and trust.

01:30:03.866 --> 01:30:10.439
It's an adventure, one that
only the two shall share.

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:12.908
KATE:
An adventure.

01:30:15.711 --> 01:30:17.012
I can't.

01:30:19.014 --> 01:30:20.549
I'm so sorry, Brad.

01:30:21.784 --> 01:30:23.085
I can't do this.

01:30:25.788 --> 01:30:30.158
I think, I think you are
an amazing man, but...

01:30:30.192 --> 01:30:32.761
BRAD:
Kate, I thought we had a plan.

01:30:32.795 --> 01:30:34.129
KATE:
We did.

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:36.064
We did have a plan,
that's part of the problem,

01:30:36.098 --> 01:30:39.602
we were always just
following the plan.

01:30:39.835 --> 01:30:42.938
I know I went up North,
but you never once

01:30:42.971 --> 01:30:45.641
came to see me.

01:30:45.674 --> 01:30:49.011
BRAD:
I just wanted you
to have what you wanted.

01:30:49.912 --> 01:30:52.114
KATE:
I know.

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:56.819
But I think that's
what you wanted.

01:30:56.852 --> 01:31:01.490
I thought I wanted that
but I don't.

01:31:01.957 --> 01:31:04.192
I'm so sorry, Brad.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:06.595
I can't do this.

01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:10.666
EDWARD:
Katie?

01:31:10.699 --> 01:31:11.634
Katie!

01:31:13.702 --> 01:31:15.538
DIANE:
She's doing the right thing.

01:31:20.242 --> 01:31:22.911
CINDY:
You poor baby.

01:31:24.079 --> 01:31:25.480
Hmm.

01:31:29.752 --> 01:31:32.521
(door opens and shuts)

01:31:34.289 --> 01:31:37.893

01:31:38.293 --> 01:31:39.127

01:31:39.161 --> 01:31:44.567
(vehicle approaching)

01:31:47.970 --> 01:31:49.838
KATE:
What happened to
minding your own business?

01:31:49.872 --> 01:31:51.974
REDFORD:
What do you
think I'm doing, lady?

01:31:52.007 --> 01:31:54.142
You are my business.

01:31:55.711 --> 01:31:56.879
(slap)

REDFORD:
Ah!

01:31:58.046 --> 01:31:59.081
What the hell?

01:31:59.114 --> 01:32:00.949
KATE:
You ruined my wedding!

01:32:02.117 --> 01:32:03.852
REDFORD:
I...

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.955
(kiss)

01:32:08.156 --> 01:32:12.595
REDFORD:
I guess it's not a bad thing.

01:32:14.062 --> 01:32:16.599
(kiss)

01:32:17.766 --> 01:32:19.635
KATE:
Let's get out of here.

01:32:19.668 --> 01:32:21.203
REDFORD:
Yeah.

01:32:23.772 --> 01:32:25.040
KATE:
Well you didn't
think this through,

01:32:25.073 --> 01:32:26.208
look what I'm wearing.

01:32:26.241 --> 01:32:28.210
REDFORD:
I always got your back.

01:32:30.613 --> 01:32:32.247
KATE:
Ha!

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.116
I'm driving.

01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:35.684
REDFORD:
It's all yours, lady.

01:32:37.085 --> 01:32:39.988
(door opens)

01:32:40.022 --> 01:32:45.628
(snowmobile starts)

01:32:45.661 --> 01:32:49.865

Holy, lady!

01:32:58.974 --> 01:33:00.042
KATE:
Are you okay?

01:33:00.075 --> 01:33:01.109
REDFORD:
Have I not taught you
better than this,

01:33:01.143 --> 01:33:01.977
come on!

01:33:02.010 --> 01:33:03.178
KATE:
Okay, hold on!

01:33:03.211 --> 01:33:04.146
REDFORD:
There you go.

01:33:04.179 --> 01:33:05.513
Give it a little throttle.

01:33:05.547 --> 01:33:10.318
KATE:
You need a new snowmobile,
it's not me, it's this thing!

01:33:10.352 --> 01:33:14.156
* I don't wanna write you
a love song *

01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:19.194
* I don't wanna
say how I feel *

01:33:19.227 --> 01:33:21.830
* I'm gonna file it,
keep it inside me *

01:33:21.864 --> 01:33:25.701
* for as long as I can
'cause baby I'm afraid *

01:33:25.734 --> 01:33:29.672
* that it's too soon
and I might lose you *

01:33:29.705 --> 01:33:37.646

in your hands *

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:41.116
* I don't wanna sing you
a love song *

01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:45.053
* a story of gunning desire

01:33:45.087 --> 01:33:49.925
* two people
taking in a sunset *

01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:53.028
* or making love
by the fire *

01:33:53.061 --> 01:33:57.165
* I'm gonna file it,
keep it inside me *

01:33:57.199 --> 01:34:01.904

in your hands *

01:34:10.212 --> 01:34:15.818
