00:10.345 --> 00:14.557
<i>NARRATOR". Gotham State Penitentiary, an
impregnable fortress under maximum security...</i>

00:14.724 --> 00:18.770
<i>...where rehabilitation, not punishment,
is the keynote.</i>

00:26.694 --> 00:28.238
Hello, Catwoman.

00:29.364 --> 00:31.199
Mm, hello.

00:31.407 --> 00:35.161
You're familiar with millionaire
Bruce Wayne?

00:36.746 --> 00:38.790
Yes, we've met.

00:40.708 --> 00:44.337
Is there any particular reason
you had me brought here?

00:44.504 --> 00:47.006
I was taking my afternoon catnap.

00:48.091 --> 00:51.970
We're, uh, taking a gamble
on you, Catwoman.

00:52.178 --> 00:54.347
Your parole application has been granted...

00:54.514 --> 00:57.267
...due to the insistence
of one of the members of the board.

00:57.475 --> 00:59.769
- You're letting me go?
-With this proviso...

00:59.978 --> 01:02.981
...a board member
will act as your parole officer.

01:03.147 --> 01:07.235
He, heaven help him,
will be totally responsible for your actions.

01:07.443 --> 01:09.487
Who's that?

01:09.654 --> 01:11.864
Millionaire Bruce Wayne.

01:13.324 --> 01:14.867
Warden...

01:15.493 --> 01:20.498
...I owe my life of crime to the fact
that I was a drop-out.

01:20.665 --> 01:24.794
I'm going back to Gotham City University
to immerse myself in education.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.757
<i>NARRATOR". Late the next night,
a curious happening takes shape...</i>

01:29.924 --> 01:33.136
<i>...in one of Gotham City University's
hallowed halls.</i>

01:33.303 --> 01:35.221
<i>A student prank?</i>

01:35.388 --> 01:41.019
<i>Or a feline scheme of that university's
most recently registered student?</i>

02:01.748 --> 02:04.709
<i>Meanwhile, in Stately Wayne Manor...</i>

02:06.502 --> 02:07.503
Yes, commissioner.

02:07.670 --> 02:10.506
I'm not certain if this requires your attention,
Batman...

02:10.673 --> 02:13.343
...but some strange goings-on
have been going on.

02:13.509 --> 02:16.804
Who is it this time, commissioner?
Joker, Egghead, Riddler, King Tut?

02:16.971 --> 02:20.892
I don't know. A statue has been stolen
at Gotham City University.

02:21.059 --> 02:22.894
Sounds like a freshman prank to me.

02:23.061 --> 02:25.438
<i>Perhaps and then again, perhaps not.</i>

02:25.605 --> 02:29.651
The statue was a full-sized replica of you,
Batman.

02:30.026 --> 02:33.780
My graven image, eh?
We'll be right there, commissioner.

02:33.946 --> 02:35.740
To the Batpoles.

04:12.378 --> 04:14.338
Utterly baffling.

04:14.505 --> 04:19.093
With all due respect to Batman's myriad fans,
why would anyone steal a mere statue?

04:19.260 --> 04:21.428
Maybe it was some kind of
dumb fraternity stunt.

04:21.596 --> 04:24.098
Unfortunately,
I can think of a more sinister reason.

04:24.265 --> 04:25.516
What, Batman?

04:25.683 --> 04:27.894
As you may recall...

04:28.060 --> 04:31.689
...that statue was made
from a perfect mold of my body.

04:32.064 --> 04:35.485
And the costume is an exact
plaster duplicate of yours.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.236
Precisely, Robin.

04:37.403 --> 04:43.034
This theft may be the first step
in some diabolical imposture of myself.

04:43.201 --> 04:45.620
Gosh, if we only had some clue.

04:45.787 --> 04:47.747
There is one, Boy Wonder.

04:47.914 --> 04:51.834
We found this freshman beanie, size 6 and
seven-eighths, at the scene of the outrage.

04:52.001 --> 04:53.211
Can you trace it?

04:53.377 --> 04:58.466
There are approximately 5700 male freshmen
enrolled for this semester at GCU...

04:58.633 --> 05:02.762
...3127 of them wear
a size 6 and seven-eighths beanie.

05:02.929 --> 05:04.305
It's a start.

05:04.472 --> 05:07.266
May I see the beanie in question,
Chief O'Hara?

05:15.733 --> 05:17.860
- Robin?
-Yes, Batman?

05:18.069 --> 05:20.029
Do you see what I see?

05:20.905 --> 05:23.574
Depends. What do you see?

05:25.868 --> 05:29.372
A single strand of red hair.

05:29.539 --> 05:33.084
- A clue?
-Could be a vital clue, Commissioner Gordon.

05:33.251 --> 05:36.379
I've just perfected
an electronic hair Bat-analyzer...

05:36.546 --> 05:40.216
...which may hold the key
to this baffling question.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.218
Let's go, Robin.

05:43.261 --> 05:47.265
<i>NARRATOR". And in the basement
of the Eta Beta Lotka sorority house...</i>

05:47.431 --> 05:50.226
<i>...adjoining the GCU campus...</i>

05:53.396 --> 05:54.939
I gotta hand it to you, Catwoman.

05:55.106 --> 05:57.733
Hiding us out in a sorority house
was a stroke of genius.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.652
Yeah. Who'd ever think of looking for men...

05:59.819 --> 06:01.529
...in an all-girls house?
-Ha, ha.

06:01.696 --> 06:04.782
There's no time for self-aggrandizement.
There's work to be done.

06:04.949 --> 06:08.995
- To be done. Cornell, have at it.
-Right, Catwoman.

06:16.085 --> 06:17.837
Thank you very much...

06:18.004 --> 06:20.256
<i>...ladies and gentlemen,
for all your applause...</i>

06:20.423 --> 06:21.841
<i>...but I don't really deserve it.</i>

06:27.471 --> 06:30.892
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen, for all your applause...

06:31.058 --> 06:33.060
...but I don't really deserve it.

06:33.561 --> 06:36.898
If I hadn't heard Batman with my own ears,
I wouldn't have believed it.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.191
That's quite good, Cornell.

06:39.358 --> 06:43.195
Just clear your throat and you'll be perfect.
Ha.

06:46.824 --> 06:48.242
Ah.

06:50.703 --> 06:54.999
Yes, that ought to do. Mm.

06:55.166 --> 06:57.585
I'll try it on for size.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.131
It's time for class.

07:02.298 --> 07:05.259
Oh, listen, fellas.
Make sure you return that statue.

07:05.468 --> 07:08.804
I want them to think
it was a simple-minded prank. Ha-ha-ha.

07:09.305 --> 07:11.015
Come on, Penn.

07:11.182 --> 07:12.725
Batman is guest lecturer today...

07:12.892 --> 07:16.103
...and we wouldn't wanna miss
any of his pearls of wisdom.

07:17.688 --> 07:19.231
Penn...

07:19.398 --> 07:21.901
...where's your beanie?

07:22.735 --> 07:26.572
I... I must have lost it somewhere.

07:26.739 --> 07:29.325
Brown, lend him yours.

07:31.243 --> 07:32.495
You cut class.

07:32.662 --> 07:34.789
Catwoman.

07:35.164 --> 07:36.207
You're under arrest.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.836
You almost gave me cataplexy. Ha!

07:41.003 --> 07:42.546
I've created a monster. Ha, ha.

07:43.089 --> 07:45.383
Oh, well. If I can't tell the difference,
who can'?

07:47.259 --> 07:50.429
I still think it's pretty fishy, Batman.

07:50.596 --> 07:54.183
Catwoman taking Elementary Criminology.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.936
I agree, Robin.

07:57.228 --> 08:00.648
Better keep our eyes peeled.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.905
Good day, students.

08:08.072 --> 08:12.159
I'll begin by remarking that criminology,
like other sciences...

08:12.326 --> 08:15.663
...has made remarkable strides
over recent years.

08:15.830 --> 08:17.331
Batman's right, students.

08:17.498 --> 08:22.044
We catch more crooks in our Batcave
anti-crime lab than in the field.

08:22.211 --> 08:28.467
For example, last night a certain statue
was purloined right here at Gotham City U.

08:29.885 --> 08:34.015
This beanie was found
at the scene of the crime.

08:34.181 --> 08:38.686
There was one strand of red hair
caught in the fabric.

08:38.852 --> 08:44.525
I have microscopically analyzed it
and here are my findings.

08:45.651 --> 08:50.031
From this single strand of hair...

08:50.239 --> 08:52.324
...I've been able to determine...

08:52.533 --> 08:56.370
...that the man is 6 feet,
one-and-three-quarters inches in height...

08:56.537 --> 08:59.582
...is 36 years old, has flat feet,
wears glasses...

08:59.749 --> 09:02.251
...speaks in a deep voice
and suffers from hay fever.

09:02.418 --> 09:04.628
Help. What do I do?

09:04.795 --> 09:05.838
Cheese it.

09:06.005 --> 09:09.341
I'll set off the bell
with my remote-control Cat-radio.

09:12.887 --> 09:13.929
Pardon me.

09:27.526 --> 09:28.736
Batman.

09:35.201 --> 09:39.747
Okay. Okay.
Now, if all you students will just clear away...

09:39.914 --> 09:42.416
...Batman and I would like to be alone.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.335
What makes you think so, Catwoman?

09:45.711 --> 09:47.088
Ooh.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.382
I just thought it would be so amusing.

09:50.591 --> 09:53.511
It would be the first time
you weren't trying to arrest me...

09:53.719 --> 09:55.596
...and I wasn't trying to murder you.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.475
Very well.

09:59.683 --> 10:04.855
Just a second while I retrieve my beanie,
my hair, my tweezers, and my notes.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.361
It gets fishier all the time, Batman.

10:10.528 --> 10:15.991
Did you happen to notice how the bell rang
two minutes after the class began?

10:16.200 --> 10:21.163
Of course. She's up to something, Robin.
I'm merely playing along with it.

10:23.165 --> 10:27.336
I'll bet every female criminal in America...

10:27.503 --> 10:30.047
...would swap her time off
for good behavior...

10:30.256 --> 10:33.175
...just to change places with me.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.804
- I'm flattered.
-Mm.

10:39.974 --> 10:42.309
As soon as I graduate...

10:42.643 --> 10:45.521
...I'll be coming to you for a job.

10:45.980 --> 10:51.735
What I want most in life
is to work side-by-side with you, Batman.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.447
That job is filled.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.117
Oh, Robin.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.869
Well...

11:00.244 --> 11:04.915
...maybe by that time
he'll be all grown up and on his own.

11:06.709 --> 11:11.714
I can't tell you how happy I am
about your change of heart.

11:12.173 --> 11:16.051
You seem to have lost all the egotism...

11:16.427 --> 11:18.596
...that once marred your great beauty.

11:19.430 --> 11:20.764
Batman?

11:20.931 --> 11:23.309
- Batman, we've been framed.
-What?

11:23.475 --> 11:26.520
I just heard over the radio,
someone who looks exactly like you...

11:26.687 --> 11:29.732
...has been positively identified
as having robbed a supermarket.

11:29.899 --> 11:32.985
Well, at least that explains
the curious theft of that statue.

11:33.152 --> 11:37.281
Don't move, you costumed-kook.
We've got you covered.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.868
You're under arrest
for knocking off a supermarket.

11:43.454 --> 11:44.622
Who the heck are you?

11:44.788 --> 11:47.583
Name's Courageous. Captain Courageous.

11:47.750 --> 11:52.463
Just arrived here from Los Angeles
under the police-exchange program.

11:52.796 --> 11:57.468
Holy Hollywood, an out-of-towner.
That's why he doesn't know who Batman is.

11:57.635 --> 11:59.637
You say I've been identified as a criminal?

11:59.803 --> 12:03.057
Twenty witnesses. What's your alibi?

12:03.224 --> 12:07.978
I've been here all morning
sipping a soda with Catwoman.

12:08.145 --> 12:11.941
- He was. I'll swear to that.
-Ha!

12:12.399 --> 12:15.152
Who's gonna take the word
of a 50-time loser?

12:15.319 --> 12:18.280
Slap the handcuffs on him, boys.

12:19.615 --> 12:21.450
Here's a dime. Call Commissioner Gordon.

12:21.617 --> 12:24.703
Sorry, sonny. Only one phone call allowed.

12:24.870 --> 12:29.083
- To his lawyer, if the kook has one.
-That's right. Go ahead and make the call.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.501
Your lawyer?

12:30.668 --> 12:36.632
The number's in the phone book
under the firm name of Alfred and Alfred.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.801
All right, let's get going.

12:47.101 --> 12:48.102
Yes, Chief O'Hara.

12:48.269 --> 12:52.147
I just heard there's to be a spontaneous
demonstration in Chimes Square tonight.

12:52.314 --> 12:54.358
Well, now,
who's demonstrating and what for?

12:54.525 --> 12:57.444
The students at Gotham City University
intend to loiter.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.072
And what's more,
Catwoman is the loiter leader.

13:00.239 --> 13:01.240
Catwoman?

13:01.407 --> 13:04.326
Assign every man you have
to the Gotham Whiteway at dusk.

13:04.493 --> 13:05.911
Yes, sir.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.962
- Batman?
-Yes.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.047
My card.

13:17.256 --> 13:19.383
Serge Tort, attorney-at-law.

13:19.550 --> 13:23.637
Specialist in felonies, misdemeanors,
and over-time parking tickets.

13:23.804 --> 13:27.141
Uh, sit down, Mr. Tort.

13:29.935 --> 13:35.316
It appears that someone has been
masquerading as me, Mr. Tort.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.693
But I'm innocent, you have my word.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.903
Oh, I'm sure you are, Mr. Batman.

13:40.070 --> 13:43.574
But there is nothing more damaging
than eyewitness testimony.

13:45.159 --> 13:47.703
Good luck, sir. Think the disguise will work?

13:47.870 --> 13:49.830
Let's hope so, Alfred.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.790
Guard.

13:53.334 --> 13:55.377
Let me out, please.

14:03.719 --> 14:07.139
Ah, Captain Courageous.
How was the first day on the job?

14:07.306 --> 14:10.267
Not bad. Not bad, Commissioner Gordon.

14:10.476 --> 14:13.520
I captured a desperate criminal today.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.773
Wonderful. Who was it?

14:15.939 --> 14:19.151
Some joker calls himself Batman.

14:19.360 --> 14:22.321
Batman? You ninny.
Release him and release him fast.

14:22.488 --> 14:23.739
But-- But-- But--

14:23.906 --> 14:26.617
You do very clever impressions
of a motorboat, captain.

14:26.784 --> 14:29.536
- Get moving.
-Yes, sir.

14:37.336 --> 14:39.463
- Hello?
-This is Commissioner Gordon.

14:39.630 --> 14:43.092
- I'd like to speak to Mr. Wayne, please.
-Yes, just a moment.

14:43.258 --> 14:44.802
Bruce.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.138
It's Commissioner Gordon.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.434
Thank you, Aunt Harriet.

14:52.601 --> 14:55.896
- Hello, commissioner.
-I just thought you'd be sorry to learn...

14:56.063 --> 15:02.194
...that Catwoman intends to lead a sit-in tonight
in the heart of Chimes Square, Mr. Wayne.

15:02.361 --> 15:06.198
I'm certain there's some
illegal reason behind it.

15:06.365 --> 15:08.409
You're her parole officer, aren't you?

15:09.910 --> 15:12.329
I guess I haven't done a very good job,
commissioner.

15:12.496 --> 15:16.917
Still, I must award you an E for effort.
Goodbye.

15:17.418 --> 15:19.753
Commissioner, the Batman's escaped.

15:19.920 --> 15:23.465
Tied up a lawyer and walked out in disguise.

15:23.632 --> 15:27.886
Ha-ha-ha. Good old Batman.
No jail can hold him, not even ours.

15:28.053 --> 15:30.180
He's probably at the Batcave already.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.684
You'll learn soon enough
not to doubt the masked manhunter.

15:37.980 --> 15:42.901
Yes, commissioner. You're calling to tell me
about Catwoman's latest peregrinations.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.946
Incredible.

15:46.155 --> 15:49.408
I just heard about it myself.
How do you do it?

15:49.575 --> 15:51.076
It's my job, commissioner.

15:51.243 --> 15:54.455
I must stay at least two steps ahead
of each criminal.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.875
We'll be at Chimes Square tonight.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.878
Holy crystal ball. How'd you know
the Batphone was gonna ring?

16:01.044 --> 16:03.839
Elementary. I'll explain on the way down.

16:04.298 --> 16:06.049
To the Batpoles.

16:15.017 --> 16:18.645
We have yet to determine
Catwoman's ultimate scheme.

16:18.812 --> 16:23.609
Let's program the Bat-calendar and see
what's transpiring in Gotham City this fine day.

16:23.775 --> 16:27.446
I'm sure we'll find the answer
to her plot here.

16:34.536 --> 16:38.457
There's a prize cat show
at Gotham City Square Garden.

16:39.333 --> 16:44.087
The opening of the Feline Fur Salon
on the Avenue of the Armenians.

16:45.380 --> 16:50.219
A rock 'n' roll concert
by The Lions & the Tigers at Spayed Stadium.

16:51.845 --> 16:56.892
And the Batagonian cat's-eye opal sale
at the offices of the Forever Jewel Company.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.561
I'm afraid we have our work cut out for us,
Robin.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.730
To the Batmobile.

17:02.606 --> 17:03.899
Every year on this date...

17:04.066 --> 17:09.070
...the Batagonian cat's-eye opal people
arrive in Gotham City to sell their jewels.

17:09.238 --> 17:12.074
Cat's-eye opals? They're bad luck.

17:12.241 --> 17:15.911
Pish-tosh.
That's a superstition not grounded in fact.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.329
Anyway, they're worth millions.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.915
- We gonna steal them?
- Naturally.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.044
I've discovered where the showroom sale is.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.878
It'll be cat's play.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.382
Yeah, but what about Batman
and the police?

17:28.549 --> 17:32.219
As per my plan, Batman is languishing
in some jail. Ha, ha!

17:32.386 --> 17:34.888
And the befuddled police
will have their gloves full...

17:35.055 --> 17:38.100
...just clearing those misguided students
off the streets.

17:38.267 --> 17:40.978
You've come up with a beaut, Catwoman.

17:41.562 --> 17:45.482
Yes. Yes, I really have.

17:45.649 --> 17:49.152
Cornell, go and get the Cat-illac
and bring it round.

17:49.319 --> 17:53.824
We're gonna transform Chimes Square
into Crime Square.

18:00.706 --> 18:05.877
<i>NARRATOR". And that night, in Chimes Square
on the Gotham City Whiteway...</i>

18:06.044 --> 18:10.090
There's only one way for us to get our rights.

18:10.257 --> 18:13.802
We must let the world know about them.

18:14.303 --> 18:19.808
Students everywhere will thank us
for what we are about to do tonight.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.310
Are you ready?

18:21.476 --> 18:24.062
Yes!

18:25.105 --> 18:26.732
Go to it!

18:30.068 --> 18:31.737
Go back, students. Go back.

18:31.903 --> 18:32.904
Aww.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.906
Go back to your homes and hearths.

18:35.616 --> 18:38.702
Can't you see she's trying
to lead you down a thorny path?

18:38.869 --> 18:41.204
Batman? I thought he was in jail.

18:41.538 --> 18:46.001
I'm afraid that
aside from his many other attributes...

18:46.168 --> 18:50.422
...Batman is probably the world's
greatest escape artist.

18:50.714 --> 18:52.466
No matter.

18:52.633 --> 18:59.014
I have something infinitely more fiendish
in mind for him.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.018
To the elevators.

19:05.437 --> 19:09.399
<i>NARRATOR". Moments later,
atop the Gotham City Chimes Building...</i>

19:09.566 --> 19:13.236
<i>Catwoman deploys her forces
in the blinking light...</i>

19:13.403 --> 19:17.240
...of <i>the Crespie's Coffee
mechanical billboard.</i>

19:22.996 --> 19:25.749
Well, citizen, to what do we owe
the pleasure of this visit?

19:26.124 --> 19:29.586
I was hoping to revive my TV show,
<i>People</i> Are Funny...

19:29.753 --> 19:33.048
...but I can't seem to find any unusual people
in Gotham City.

19:33.215 --> 19:36.718
No, this is just an ordinary, fine,
upstanding metropolis.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.387
Not many weirdos.

19:38.553 --> 19:42.974
- Any particular types in mind?
-Oh, someone perhaps with a strange costume.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.726
Mm.

19:44.976 --> 19:50.190
No, most of those characters like Joker,
Penguin, King Tut are safely locked up.

19:50.399 --> 19:55.445
Maybe somebody with a dual identity
or a unique approach to a problem.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.572
I'm climbing the walls looking for them.

19:57.739 --> 19:58.907
I wish we could help you.

19:59.074 --> 20:02.953
But we're just a couple of ordinary crime
fighters going about our mundane business.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.915
I see. Well, thank you for your interest.
Maybe I'll give up the whole idea.

20:07.708 --> 20:10.168
Too bad. It's a great show.

20:14.881 --> 20:19.594
Costume? Dual identity?
Climbing the walls?

20:20.262 --> 20:21.430
Hey, Batman.

20:23.682 --> 20:25.767
They should have been here by now.

20:25.976 --> 20:27.644
- Here we are.
- In the flesh.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.647
Oh, Catwoman.

20:30.814 --> 20:32.399
Catwoman, will you never learn?

20:32.733 --> 20:34.484
Men!

20:34.943 --> 20:40.490
Two obstacles stand between me and you
and a life of splendor and plenty.

20:40.657 --> 20:41.992
Eradicate them.

21:11.813 --> 21:13.774
Batman. Batman.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.793
Get them.

21:37.798 --> 21:40.342
You had your chance, Catwoman,
but you blew it.

21:40.509 --> 21:42.886
You're a blot on the name
of Gotham City University.

21:43.053 --> 21:46.097
When the students find out
what kind of a person you really are...

21:46.264 --> 21:48.183
...they'll hate you for forever.

21:50.602 --> 21:52.521
Nobody loves me.

21:54.397 --> 21:56.942
There, there, Catwoman. It'll be all right.

21:58.944 --> 22:02.322
Can I use my cat-kerchief?

22:02.531 --> 22:04.533
I'm ruining my eyeshadow.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.036
Of course.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.864
Fools.

22:44.072 --> 22:47.701
Don't they know that tears
are a woman's most effective weapon?

22:51.121 --> 22:52.998
Batman.

22:53.331 --> 22:56.293
Batman, wake up.

23:01.965 --> 23:03.425
What are you doing?

23:04.175 --> 23:09.264
I've flavored the coffee in this peculator
with a dash of sulfuric acid.

23:10.056 --> 23:14.853
Once a minute,
the peculator pours its contents into the cup.

23:15.312 --> 23:20.942
So if you get that searing feeling
in your stomachs, it won't be heartburn.

23:21.109 --> 23:23.320
It'll be all burn.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.280
Holy caffeine.

23:26.489 --> 23:31.036
And best of all,
everybody will see you go up in smoke.

23:31.494 --> 23:33.204
Look.

23:40.545 --> 23:44.299
You have a perverted sense of the dramatic,
Catwoman.

23:45.091 --> 23:49.554
You're absolutely right.

23:49.763 --> 23:53.725
Brown, throw the switch.

23:56.937 --> 24:02.067
You have one minute. Bye-bye.
