WEBVTT

00:03.771 --> 00:05.573
Sorry we're late
for movie night.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.675
I was trying to help Carol
pick out an outfit

00:07.708 --> 00:08.542
for Comic-Fan-Fest.

00:08.576 --> 00:10.811
Kip wanted me
to go as Princess Leia,

00:10.844 --> 00:13.047
but I look horrible in white.

00:13.081 --> 00:16.117
That's the only thing I remember
from our wedding.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.119
You know what?

00:18.152 --> 00:19.253
I've been thinking
about going to that, uh,

00:19.287 --> 00:21.055
whatever that "Comic
Fest" thing is.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.056
My boss says we need

00:22.090 --> 00:24.058
to start appealing more
to the nerd audience.

00:24.092 --> 00:26.194
See, our-our station airs
a Big Bang Theory rerun

00:26.227 --> 00:28.396
every day at 3:30, huge ratings,

00:28.429 --> 00:31.632
but our 4:00 p.m. newscast
isn't holding enough viewers.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.567
Get on it, Nathan.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.303
Because you need to
hold on to that job.

00:35.336 --> 00:36.770
I mean, what else are
you qualified to do?

00:36.804 --> 00:37.805
Mannequin at Old Navy?

00:38.872 --> 00:41.775
Okay, Mikayla finally finished
her math homework.

00:41.809 --> 00:45.146
Seems like a waste of time for
a girl who's gonna marry rich.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.416
Did you guys pick a movie?

00:48.449 --> 00:50.751
Mm. Kip and I
want to watch...

00:50.784 --> 00:52.086
CAROL and KIP:
Star Wars...

00:52.120 --> 00:53.854
to get psyched
for Comic-Fan-Fest.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.723
We're not allowed to watch that.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.658
Daddy won't let us
because Jeff said so.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.128
God, I am so sick of Jeff!

01:00.161 --> 01:02.330
Say, I'm just trying
to fit in here.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.797
Who's Jeff?

01:03.831 --> 01:07.801
He's the leader of the cuckoo
commune Adam grew up on.

01:07.835 --> 01:11.305
Jeff told Daddy watching
Star Wars can cause seizures.

01:11.339 --> 01:14.208
Honey, I don't want to say
your dad's a little simple,

01:14.242 --> 01:16.677
but Tom Hanks would get
an Oscar for playing him.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.847
We're watching Star Wars.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.415
Great. No, this
is perfect.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.651
I can brush up on
my nerd knowledge.

01:23.684 --> 01:27.555
Can't just blindly pander
to the Big Bang fans.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.789
They'll just
see right through it.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.824
They're television's
smartest audience.

01:56.217 --> 01:59.387
(Star Wars playing over TV)

01:59.420 --> 02:01.189
When I woke up at the cafe,

02:01.222 --> 02:02.323
we still didn't have
any customers,

02:02.356 --> 02:04.792
so I just decided
to close up early.

02:04.825 --> 02:05.793
I...

02:05.826 --> 02:07.195
Oh, God, it's Star Wars!

02:07.228 --> 02:08.862
Cover your eyes!

02:08.896 --> 02:10.831
Adam, relax.

02:10.864 --> 02:11.965
Nobody's having a seizure.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.502
Wait, wait, wait. Can we just
rewind that last part?

02:14.535 --> 02:15.903
Where'd they say they
were going? Alderaan?

02:15.936 --> 02:17.538
Wait a second,
d-did you say Alderaan?

02:17.571 --> 02:19.673
That's where
Exalted Leader Jeff is from.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.475
The leader of your commune
was from another planet?

02:22.876 --> 02:25.313
Please tell me you aren't
about to peel off your skin

02:25.346 --> 02:28.182
and introduce us
to the real you.

02:28.216 --> 02:30.951
It's not another planet;
Jeff grew up in Alderaan, Iowa.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.588
I never heard of a town
in Iowa called Alderaan.

02:34.622 --> 02:37.291
And I have a photographic,
uh, whatchamacallit.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.695
You see, Alderaan was
wiped out in a giant fire,

02:41.729 --> 02:42.930
and then Jeff had to move in

02:42.963 --> 02:45.199
with his aunt and uncle
in a mud hut.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.968
And then they were killed
by some state troopers

02:48.001 --> 02:50.204
from "the Dark Side
of the force."

02:52.340 --> 02:53.974
Guess who the police chief
turned out to be.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.276
ALL:
Jeff's father.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.612
Your cult leader
appears to have stolen

02:58.646 --> 03:00.314
his life history from Star Wars.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.783
Everything you're talking
about was in the movie.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.619
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.455
Our school mascot was
the Millennium Falcon.

03:08.756 --> 03:11.625
All our food was kept
in Jabba the Hutt.

03:13.627 --> 03:16.797
You know what, I'm not gonna
let him get away with this.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.599
Hey, Brenda.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.833
It's me, Adam.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.670
No, I don't go by
Moon Potato anymore.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.937
No, it's not
because someone else

03:23.971 --> 03:25.939
at work was named Moon Potato.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.242
Listen, Brenda, I need you
to tell Jeff something

03:28.276 --> 03:29.943
the next time he comes down
to the gas station

03:29.977 --> 03:31.579
to fill up
his water bottles, okay?

03:31.612 --> 03:34.248
I need you to tell him
that I have seen Star Wars,

03:34.282 --> 03:35.316
and I am onto him.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.354
How do you get a name
like Moon Potato anyway?

03:40.388 --> 03:42.022
You see, on the commune,
your first name is

03:42.055 --> 03:44.325
whatever your mother was
looking at during conception,

03:44.358 --> 03:46.760
and your last name is
your father's favorite food.

03:46.794 --> 03:50.798
You're married to an interesting
man, Headboard Pot Roast.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.970
NATHAN:
Here we go.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.673
Hi, there. WXDN News. I was
just wondering if I could...

03:59.707 --> 04:01.041
CAROL:
Hey, Nathan!

04:01.074 --> 04:03.344
Isn't this fun?

04:05.012 --> 04:06.447
What are you
two dressed as?

04:06.480 --> 04:09.317
The waitstaff at the
Boca Raton Pizza Hut?

04:09.350 --> 04:12.686
I am Captain Janeway
from Star Trek.

04:12.720 --> 04:16.357
I have no idea who that is,
but I think I'm pulling it off.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.058
How's your story going?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.560
Oh, it's rough.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.029
All the people here
only want to be interviewed

04:22.062 --> 04:24.332
by podcasts or blog-casts
or pod-blogs.

04:24.365 --> 04:27.067
Is what I'm saying even words?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.036
Look at these podcasters;
they're not even journalists.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.439
They don't understand
the subtleties of the craft.

04:31.472 --> 04:36.510
I took an entire class to learn
how to do a dramatic...

04:36.544 --> 04:39.079
pause.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.781
(applause)

04:40.814 --> 04:42.450
Stop it.

04:42.483 --> 04:45.353
Stop, please!

04:45.386 --> 04:47.020
Unless you want to go louder!

04:47.054 --> 04:50.358
(crowd cheering)

04:50.391 --> 04:52.926
Nathan, do you know
who that is?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.428
I don't know,
the guy who invented

04:54.462 --> 04:57.498
deleting the history
on your Internet browser?

04:57.531 --> 04:59.099
Are you kidding?

04:59.132 --> 05:02.570
That's the author of Fire
and Rain, Martin J.S. Essex.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.438
If you're looking to get
in with these nerds,

05:04.472 --> 05:05.706
you should interview him.

05:05.739 --> 05:06.974
He is our king!

05:08.776 --> 05:10.811
I'm hoping to get
a Kippie with him.
A what?

05:10.844 --> 05:13.113
A Kippie. Uh, a Kippie's
like a selfie but better,

05:13.146 --> 05:15.983
because Kip's always in it.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.951
Martin J.S. Essex
must be his pen name,

05:17.985 --> 05:19.687
because that's Cory Simpson.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.621
I used to teach him.

05:20.654 --> 05:24.024
He was an exchange student
from New Zealand.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.059
You rode the bus with him.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.828
He'd sit on the
bus driver's lap

05:27.861 --> 05:30.431
because he'd get car sick
if he couldn't see the road.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.100
Oh, yeah.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.904
Always kind of assumed that
he'd end up a bus driver.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.779
Nobody talk to me.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.449
I'm trying to rest
my face muscles

05:48.482 --> 05:52.386
so I can get the perfect
smile for my Kippie.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.087
Nobody is
talking to you.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.724
(hisses)

05:56.757 --> 05:58.526
Who should I make it out to?

05:58.559 --> 06:00.027
Mrs. Blast.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.663
Blast from the past.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.765
Mrs. Miller!

06:04.798 --> 06:06.600
You remember my son?

06:06.634 --> 06:09.102
How about an autograph
for your old bus buddy?

06:09.136 --> 06:10.971
Yeah, sure.
Who should I make it out to?

06:11.004 --> 06:12.005
Nathan Miller the backstabber?

06:12.039 --> 06:14.141
Nathan Miller the ingrate?

06:14.174 --> 06:16.810
Or would you prefer
Nathan Miller the devil?

06:16.844 --> 06:18.512
But that would
just be redundant.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.414
I'm not with them.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.582
Kippie!

06:21.615 --> 06:22.616
(camera clicks)

06:25.886 --> 06:27.421
Security!

06:27.455 --> 06:29.557
Remove this backstabber
from my sight.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.124
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.760
At least just tell me
what I did.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.194
Is this because
I made fun of you

06:34.227 --> 06:35.829
for sitting
on the bus driver's lap?

06:35.863 --> 06:38.198
Because in-in my defense...

06:38.231 --> 06:41.168
you were sitting
on the bus driver's lap.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.936
Fine, Nathan.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.572
You really want to know?

06:44.605 --> 06:47.808
It happened many years ago,
in the kingdom of Leesburg.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.844
*

06:53.514 --> 06:55.516
(crows cawing)

07:05.526 --> 07:07.928
MARTIN: In the land of
middle school, you were king.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.930
The ruler of the popular crowd.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.132
Highborn, as it were.

07:12.165 --> 07:15.803
I was an outcast,
cursed by my extreme intellect

07:15.836 --> 07:18.105
and the itchy blazer
my mom made me wear.

07:20.140 --> 07:24.444
As different as we both were,
our paths were soon to cross.

07:26.213 --> 07:29.517
Winter was coming,
and with it midterms.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.151
You were intellectually
ill-equipped

07:31.184 --> 07:33.453
and sent word
for reinforcements.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.161
We forged a sacred alliance.

07:41.194 --> 07:44.197
I would help you in your
epic battle against algebra.

07:44.231 --> 07:48.135
And from then on, you would
be seen in public with me.

07:48.168 --> 07:52.239
The King of Cool and
the Hand of the King of Cool.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.174
It took almost a fortnight,

07:54.207 --> 07:56.109
but eventually
I taught you the formulas

07:56.143 --> 07:58.712
to slay the algebraic beast.

07:58.746 --> 08:02.015
We toasted our victory
with orange libations

08:02.049 --> 08:04.284
from the land of Crush,

08:04.317 --> 08:06.720
brought to us by
one of your castle wenches.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.957
And you swore that a Miller
always pays his debts.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.224
(laughs heartily)

08:11.258 --> 08:12.425
(laughs heartily)

08:12.459 --> 08:14.962
It wasn't long before
our newfound alliance

08:14.995 --> 08:16.263
was put to the test.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.932
Your bannermen were
dishonoring me after kickball.

08:18.966 --> 08:22.936
But then my new ally emerged
through the darkness.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.147
But it turned out

08:34.181 --> 08:36.249
that a Miller pays back
his debts in betrayal.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.589
And then in a final
act of treachery,

08:41.622 --> 08:43.256
you unsheathed
your mighty broadsword

08:43.290 --> 08:45.258
and chopped off my head!

08:46.594 --> 08:48.596
Yeah, I don't
remember any of that.

08:48.629 --> 08:51.231
And, clearly, I did
not cut off your head.

08:51.264 --> 08:54.267
And thank God 'cause,
man, you look good!

08:56.003 --> 08:57.705
Well, maybe you didn't
cut off my head,

08:57.738 --> 08:59.607
but you stabbed me
in the back, man!

08:59.640 --> 09:00.273
Isn't that even crueler?

09:00.307 --> 09:02.309
That was a long time ago.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.978
My son needs this interview,
and you owe me.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.080
Remember when I convinced
all of the kids

09:07.114 --> 09:09.883
that boogers were a delicacy
in New Zealand?

09:12.620 --> 09:14.688
All right.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.657
Fine.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.192
I'll let you interview
me... for your mother.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.028
You can moderate
my Q&A panel tomorrow

09:21.061 --> 09:22.830
and film it
for the news.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.599
You have read my
new book, right?

09:25.633 --> 09:27.768
(chuckles):
Are you kidding?

09:27.801 --> 09:31.338
As many times as
I've read the other ones.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.007
Why don't we save all
the book talk for tomorrow,

09:34.041 --> 09:36.376
because I'd love to hear
about your new life.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.211
How about I take you
out to lunch?

09:38.245 --> 09:40.047
Sure, we can take my bus.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.381
You'll meet my bus driver.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.050
He has the most
comfortable lap.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.157
Man, look at
this thing.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.660
Never be able to read
this in one night.

09:52.693 --> 09:53.861
I'll help you.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.129
Hey, check out
this selfie I just got.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.165
Me and the only other
black dude here.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.205
Well, I just finished
watching the new trilogy.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.775
Now I know why Jeff named
his youngest Jar Jar Binks.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.611
That kid looks exactly
like Jar Jar Binks.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.983
That poor girl.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.018
(knocking)

10:20.020 --> 10:22.723
Jeff!
I got your message, Moon Potato.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.225
Get out of here, Jeff.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.027
And nobody calls me
Moon Potato anymore.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.328
Was there another
Moon Potato...

10:28.361 --> 10:30.698
There was not another
Moon Potato at work!

10:36.770 --> 10:39.773
And so that's why Baldomore
is so eager to capture

10:39.807 --> 10:41.942
his father-in-law's castle,
because he knows

10:41.975 --> 10:44.745
that once his mistress gives
birth to the blue dragon,

10:44.778 --> 10:48.381
he will once again have the
upper hand over the Ninth Queen.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.151
(laughing)

10:51.184 --> 10:53.386
That's so funny.
What?

10:53.420 --> 10:54.755
It's just that
you're so into it,

10:54.788 --> 10:56.824
like it's real,
and it's just...

10:56.857 --> 10:59.760
well, it's...
it's dragon babies, I mean...

11:02.162 --> 11:05.733
Even the breath of a
newborn dragon can melt

11:05.766 --> 11:08.736
an entire ship made of
Chrisharian diamonds.

11:10.771 --> 11:11.872
(laughs)

11:11.905 --> 11:12.940
Sorry.
I-I knew you wouldn't...

11:12.973 --> 11:14.241
I knew you wouldn't get it!
No, no!

11:14.274 --> 11:16.276
Certain people just don't
understand fantasy.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.011
What? Rational people?

11:18.045 --> 11:20.848
Spoiled people
who grew up popular

11:20.881 --> 11:23.817
and birthmark-free.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.486
Who never knew what it was like
to be an outcast.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.955
People like you
don't need fantasy

11:27.988 --> 11:30.891
because your reality
was so perfect.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.060
Oh, you know what?
My reality was far from perfect.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.796
Do you know how guilty I feel
for making it impossible

11:35.829 --> 11:39.733
for my parents
to be proud of my sister?

11:39.767 --> 11:42.770
You have no idea
what it means to be ostracized,

11:42.803 --> 11:44.738
literally and figuratively.

11:44.772 --> 11:45.605
Oh, there's two more words

11:45.638 --> 11:47.274
you probably don't know
the meaning of!

11:47.307 --> 11:49.242
Oh, oh! I'm sorry!
You were such an outcast.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.378
You told me that in high school
you were the captain

11:51.411 --> 11:53.246
of the football team
and a cheerleader!

11:53.280 --> 11:55.715
It was powder puff football!

11:57.250 --> 12:00.921
We were all our own
cheerleaders!

12:00.954 --> 12:02.790
You know what? You know what?
You know what? You know what?

12:02.823 --> 12:04.257
You know what? You know what?
You know what?

12:04.291 --> 12:07.795
People like you are never
gonna get people like me.

12:07.828 --> 12:11.331
I am not helping you pretend
that you're one of us!

12:11.364 --> 12:13.433
Oh, fine! You know what? I'll
just figure it out on my own.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.268
You know what?! You know what?!
You know what?! You know what?!

12:15.302 --> 12:17.004
You know what?

12:24.144 --> 12:25.846
You need to do something,
Adam, okay?

12:25.879 --> 12:27.447
You can't just
let him stand out

12:27.480 --> 12:28.448
on the front porch forever.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.517
I mean, he's already been
out here for, like...

12:30.550 --> 12:32.052
How long have
you been out here?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.120
26 hours.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.224
26 hours.
He's freaking me out!

12:37.257 --> 12:38.859
Oh, fine.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.894
Let him in.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.835
Namaste.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.870
You got two minutes,
Exalted Liar Jeff.

12:49.903 --> 12:50.904
Look.

12:50.938 --> 12:51.939
Let me explain.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.174
We were a bunch of hippies
living in the woods.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.043
One night, everyone
paired off to have sex,

12:56.076 --> 12:59.112
leaving only me and Fat Reggie.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.081
So I roller-skated into town,
discovered a little movie

13:01.114 --> 13:02.415
called Star Wars.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.951
The next day,
I told everybody about it.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.886
But they were so stoned,
they missed the part

13:05.919 --> 13:07.387
where I said it was a movie!

13:09.990 --> 13:11.091
They were blown away.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.926
Suddenly, everyone's looking up
to me like their leader.

13:12.960 --> 13:13.961
And we needed that.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.829
When I took over,
we were down to four condoms

13:15.863 --> 13:17.831
and a half bag of mushrooms.

13:17.865 --> 13:21.401
Our commune features
a lot of sex and drugs.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.535
Is there golf?

13:22.569 --> 13:25.605
No, but we have a deal worked
out with a nearby Hyatt.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.341
Sign me up.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.977
I can't believe
people fell for this.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.979
Well, keep in mind the drugs.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.280
Plus, the fact is
they wanted to.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.883
We needed some structure
to live by.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.885
All right, so you got
caught up in a lie, fine.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.020
But why did you make us
do all that stupid stuff,

13:40.053 --> 13:41.989
like write down two secrets
and then drop them

13:42.022 --> 13:43.423
in a magic metal trash can?

13:43.456 --> 13:47.895
It was called
Write Two, Drop Two.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.498
"R2D2."

13:53.633 --> 13:54.868
Look, I had my reasons.

13:54.902 --> 13:57.971
I used R2 as a suggestion box
to help solve people's problems.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.139
I remember a certain

13:59.172 --> 14:00.974
tall drink of awkward
who always wrote

14:01.008 --> 14:02.175
about being nervous
around girls.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.978
Yeah, you told me
that I had a special "force"

14:05.012 --> 14:08.949
inside me that would protect me
from humiliation.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.918
It was just a lie
like everything about you.

14:10.951 --> 14:14.021
Was it? Or did thinking you had
a special force inside of you

14:14.054 --> 14:16.056
give you the courage
to approach your wife?

14:17.925 --> 14:20.994
Holy mother of Jeff.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.529
I understand
if you don't like me.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.197
But please don't tell
the others what you know.

14:24.231 --> 14:25.332
They need this!

14:25.365 --> 14:28.001
I mean, I guess everybody needs
to believe in something.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.070
And-and the truth is,
all these lessons you stole

14:30.103 --> 14:32.973
from Star Wars made me
the person I am today.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.375
And I'm glad you've lived
the life you have.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.310
Because I love
who you are today.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.314
Jeff, I'm sorry I said
some harsh things.

14:41.348 --> 14:44.117
If you want to stick around,
I'd love to catch up.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.652
Yeah, you should
stay for dinner.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.387
Are you kidding?
I'd love to.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.622
Your wife is
quite beautiful.
Yeah.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.658
I look forward to
meeting the others.

14:57.697 --> 15:01.034
Okay, we go live
any minute.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.402
Go get them.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.572
Carol! Carol!

15:05.605 --> 15:06.573
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me,

15:06.606 --> 15:09.309
excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.311
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

15:11.344 --> 15:14.181
You're a big man for showing
up to Nathan's interview, Kip.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.615
I know you're mad at him.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.618
Well, I can separate
the man from his work.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.120
I still love Paul Newman

15:20.153 --> 15:23.590
even though his pasta sauce
gives me heartburn.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.125
Thank you, Bernice.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.327
We're live here
at Comic-Fan-Fest,

15:27.360 --> 15:30.630
and I'm sitting with the one
and only Martin J.S. Essex.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.299
(crowd cheering)

15:34.601 --> 15:37.404
Martin, your Fire and Rain
series is the hottest...

15:37.437 --> 15:38.571
Boring!

15:38.605 --> 15:40.507
These guys already know
about my books.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.242
Because they're nerds
just like me.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.510
Right, my brother nerds?

15:43.543 --> 15:45.545
(crowd cheering)

15:47.280 --> 15:49.249
We're all nerds here.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.383
Except for this guy.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.486
You see, Nathan and I went
to middle school together.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.589
And back at school, he
was the popular kid.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.525
(crowd booing)

16:00.227 --> 16:01.528
And he used to bully me!

16:01.561 --> 16:03.063
Me!

16:03.096 --> 16:05.098
Well, that's all for today
from Comic-Fan-Fest.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.733
Back to you, Bernice,
in the studio.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.036
We can't go back.
Bernice took off her Spanx,

16:09.069 --> 16:10.537
and she needs at least
a five-minute warning

16:10.570 --> 16:11.571
to put them back on.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.742
What are you doing, Martin?
We had a deal here.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.544
I do owe you, Carol Miller.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.580
But I owe your son
so much more!

16:20.613 --> 16:23.016
A double cross.
Classic MJSE.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.251
Oh.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.419
I was as angry
as you, my nerds!

16:26.453 --> 16:28.588
But then I spoke to his mum,
and I couldn't believe

16:28.621 --> 16:29.689
the pathetic stuff she revealed.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.091
I mean, this guy?

16:31.124 --> 16:32.692
His life sucks!

16:32.725 --> 16:35.628
(crowd cheering)

16:35.662 --> 16:37.730
Now, I'm a gentleman,

16:37.764 --> 16:39.799
so I'm not gonna repeat
what was said in confidence

16:39.832 --> 16:42.102
over a turkey
club and a Fanta.

16:42.135 --> 16:46.706
But I will show you the video
I secretly recorded.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.810
I had no idea my son was
a bully in middle school.

16:50.843 --> 16:54.347
At home, he was a sweet,
sensitive angel.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.349
We couldn't even play
the board game Clue

16:56.383 --> 16:59.519
without him crying because
he was so upset someone died.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.054
(laughter)

17:04.224 --> 17:06.826
Oh, I-I'm sorry
if murder upset me as a child.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.461
I mean, if you can't
trust a professor

17:08.495 --> 17:11.164
and a colonel,
who can you trust?

17:11.198 --> 17:13.133
His marriage
only lasted three years.

17:13.166 --> 17:16.236
But I think it's gonna
take him six to get over it.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.237
(laughs)

17:17.270 --> 17:18.705
His woman could
only stand

17:18.738 --> 17:20.640
being with him
for three years

17:20.673 --> 17:21.574
before she split.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.811
BOTH:
Women are hard.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.546
Wait till you see this.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.516
I mean, he was so lonely
after his divorce.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.419
It was clear
he needed a roommate.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.520
(laughs)

17:33.553 --> 17:34.854
I'm sorry.
What was that?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.290
A 43-year-old man
needs a roommate?

17:37.324 --> 17:38.725
(laughs)

17:38.758 --> 17:40.627
Are you not entertained?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.462
There's nothing wrong
with having a roommate.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.797
Did you laugh at
Laverne & Shirley,

17:44.831 --> 17:47.334
Perfect Strangers,
Kate & Allie?

17:47.367 --> 17:49.536
Well, you should have.
Those are great shows.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.873
Well, wait till you see
who the roommate was.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.642
And let me tell you,

17:55.675 --> 17:59.479
the two of us had a blast
living together.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.148
(laughs)

18:01.181 --> 18:02.149
His mom!

18:02.182 --> 18:03.350
(laughs)

18:03.383 --> 18:04.517
His mom!

18:04.551 --> 18:06.386
Come on, guys,
what's wrong with you?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.621
He's living
with his mom!

18:08.655 --> 18:10.623
I live with my mom,
and if it wasn't for her,

18:10.657 --> 18:12.125
I wouldn't be here today!

18:12.159 --> 18:13.460
She drove me.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.828
MAN:
Yeah!

18:15.862 --> 18:18.531
Yeah, that's right.
I did live with my mom.

18:18.565 --> 18:19.766
And I wouldn't trade the time

18:19.799 --> 18:21.834
we had together for anything
in the world.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.703
(crowd cheering)

18:25.538 --> 18:27.307
You're missing
the point. We won!

18:27.340 --> 18:28.641
The nerds won.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.777
Nathan Miller is a loser,
and I have a private jet

18:30.810 --> 18:32.712
with my face painted
on the front of it.

18:32.745 --> 18:33.780
Look!

18:37.850 --> 18:39.886
Maybe you should get back on it.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.821
And leave Nathan Miller alone,

18:41.854 --> 18:44.191
because he's more
like us than you are.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.192
OTHERS:
Yeah!

18:45.225 --> 18:47.760
(crowd cheering)

18:49.529 --> 18:52.599
You know what? I don't have to
take this from you stupid nerds!

18:52.632 --> 18:54.434
(crowd booing)

18:56.903 --> 18:59.372
Yeah, that's right.
I love my mom.

18:59.406 --> 19:02.342
And sure, I've had
my share of women troubles.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.511
But like you, I'm tough.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.513
We're tough nerds.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.181
We're terds.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.618
Nope, we're nerds.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.487
We're, uh... we're just nerds.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.323
(crowd cheering)

19:19.892 --> 19:22.395
So what did we learn here
tonight, Leesburg?

19:22.429 --> 19:25.265
Life's really about embracing
the lessons you learn

19:25.298 --> 19:28.268
along the way and becoming
the best person you can be.

19:28.301 --> 19:31.371
Because no matter who we are,

19:31.404 --> 19:33.406
we all have a little nerd
inside us.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.379
That's the message
I'll be taking away.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.847
Good night, Leesburg.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.217
Well, I hope that helped
Nathan get more viewers.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.419
It should, as long as
the Big Ba audience

19:46.453 --> 19:47.787
stuck around to watch
the whole thing.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.589
Oh, I'm sure they did.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.923
They'll make the
right choice.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.860
They're television's
smartest audience.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.472
Well, movie night is delayed
till Debbie finishes

20:05.505 --> 20:07.307
helping Mikayla
with her homework.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.841
Oh, I'll go tell them to stop.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.710
There's nothing
you'd learn in the fourth grade

20:10.743 --> 20:12.512
that can't wait until the fifth.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.883
Nice job yesterday
at Comic-Fan-Fest.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.285
Thanks, Kip.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.453
You know what?
I got to say you were right.

20:20.487 --> 20:23.390
Until yesterday, I didn't know
what it's like to be an outcast.

20:23.423 --> 20:26.859
When they were booing me, I
gladly would've taken fantasy...

20:28.695 --> 20:29.996
...over reality.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.964
Oh.
Sorry.

20:31.998 --> 20:35.935
Dramatic pause
is kind of a hard habit...

20:35.968 --> 20:38.505
to break.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.307
Well, it was
great seeing you, Jeff.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.674
You, too, Moon Potato.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.776
I'm so proud of you.
And your wife is lovely.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.945
You can't sleep with my wife.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.680
Fair enough. I'll stop asking.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.416
But call Brenda
if you change your mind.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.451
Tom, I'm leaving!

20:56.055 --> 21:00.627
I'll be back Monday.
Which Monday? I don't know.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.362
