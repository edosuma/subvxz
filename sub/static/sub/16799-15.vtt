00:02.500 --> 00:03.660
Previously on Elementary...

00:05.830 --> 00:06.865
You work for Sherlock.

00:06.900 --> 00:09.300
I don't work for anyone.
I'm his new partner.

00:09.340 --> 00:10.659
The training I'm attempting
to provide her

00:10.710 --> 00:12.029
is an attempt to channel

00:12.080 --> 00:13.308
certain residual feelings
that she has

00:13.340 --> 00:14.534
into a productive skill.

00:14.580 --> 00:15.569
You think
that Kitty needs help

00:15.610 --> 00:17.077
above and beyond
my mentorship.

00:17.110 --> 00:18.077
She's a rape victim.

00:18.110 --> 00:20.044
She was kept and tortured.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.719
GREGSON: Her name is Melanie
Vilkas. Take a look at her back.

00:22.750 --> 00:25.389
They're the same markings
that are on Kitty's back.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.411
The man who hurt her
is here in New York.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.519
This is why I became
a detective--

00:29.560 --> 00:30.788
to hunt this man. I'm ready.

00:30.830 --> 00:33.549
You're going to die
tonight, quite horribly.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.124
(knocking at door)

00:37.430 --> 00:38.829
You must understand.

00:38.870 --> 00:42.135
You will always...

00:42.170 --> 00:43.728
be my friend.

00:43.770 --> 00:44.759
Captain?
GREGSON: We got him.

00:44.810 --> 00:47.836
The doctor said it was
some kind of corrosive.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.074
He's gonna wake up

00:49.110 --> 00:49.974
after a few hours,

00:50.010 --> 00:51.773
and I'm gonna ask him
who did this to him.

00:51.810 --> 00:53.448
I'm gonna have to
go after them.

00:53.480 --> 00:54.811
Do you think
I did the right thing?

00:54.850 --> 00:57.546
I think you do not have
the stain of a murder upon you.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.182
Do you know what
I haven't said to anyone

00:59.220 --> 01:01.085
in a really long time?

01:01.120 --> 01:03.122
I love you.

01:07.230 --> 01:10.119
(door opens, closes)

01:10.170 --> 01:13.139
Hey. Thought you had a funeral
to go to this morning.

01:13.170 --> 01:14.296
I do.

01:14.340 --> 01:15.830
Old friend of
yours, right?

01:15.870 --> 01:17.633
Old colleague, actually.

01:17.670 --> 01:19.479
Cy Durning.

01:19.510 --> 01:21.808
Prosecuted many of the
cases I lent a hand in

01:21.840 --> 01:24.707
when I consulted
at Scotland Yard.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.149
Good man.

01:26.180 --> 01:28.319
Better barrister.

01:28.350 --> 01:30.147
Condolences.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.158
Mm.

01:32.190 --> 01:35.159
If he's British, how come
the funeral's in New York?

01:35.190 --> 01:36.487
Wife's American.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.454
They retired to New
Jersey last year.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.219
He dropped dead of a heart
attack three days ago.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.226
Still, kinder fate
than that

01:44.270 --> 01:46.795
of Gunther Klecko's
busmess partner,

01:46.840 --> 01:48.239
Yeah?

01:48.270 --> 01:50.864
Yeah. We think
he shot the guy to death.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.502
In a warehouse
that they co-own.

01:52.540 --> 01:54.735
Watson texted me
from the scene.

01:54.780 --> 01:56.179
Police have been
searching for hours,

01:56.210 --> 01:57.871
still can't find
a murder weapon.

01:57.910 --> 02:01.209
We don't find it, a jury
might actually believe the story

02:01.250 --> 02:02.888
he's peddling
about "some black guy"

02:02.920 --> 02:04.888
killing the partner
then fleeing.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.218
Would've been nice _
to have a chance to lean on hIm.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.228
Look at the guy--
he's actually sweating.

02:09.260 --> 02:11.649
But he asked for a lavwer
as soon as he got here.

02:11.690 --> 02:13.624
Are you familiar with
the Freedom Arms .22 caliber

02:13.660 --> 02:15.594
belt buckle handgun?

02:15.630 --> 02:18.394
It's one of the, uh, tiniest
pistols on the market.

02:18.430 --> 02:21.297
You think we're having a
hard time finding the gun

02:21.340 --> 02:23.467
at the warehouse
because It's small?

02:23.510 --> 02:25.432
I don't it's at
the warehouse.

02:25.470 --> 02:28.177
And I don't think he's
sweating because he's nervous.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.316
Wait, are you saying

02:32.350 --> 02:34.170
he put the gun...

02:34.220 --> 02:37.189
You don't need an interrogation
to prove that he's guilty.

02:37.220 --> 02:39.609
You, uh, just need
a pair of these.

02:49.230 --> 02:51.528
PRIEST:
God, we thank you for

02:51.570 --> 02:54.266
the life that you give us.

02:54.300 --> 02:58.430
It is full of work
and of responsibility,

02:58.470 --> 03:01.678
of sorrow and of joy.

03:01.710 --> 03:06.249
Today, we thank you
for Cy Durning,

03:06.280 --> 03:10.341
for what he has given
and received.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.381
Help us in our mourning

03:12.420 --> 03:14.786
and teach us_ to live
for the Wing,

03:14.820 --> 03:16.981
in the time we still
have left to us.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.521
(phone chimes)

03:19.560 --> 03:21.323
(quietly):
Sorry.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.520
(clears throat)

03:22.570 --> 03:25.323
(priest continues talking
quietly)

03:30.470 --> 03:31.767
(phone vibrates)

03:37.010 --> 03:39.205
*

03:48.460 --> 03:49.688
(phone vibrates)

04:09.010 --> 04:12.411
Sherlock T. Ainsworth.

04:12.450 --> 04:16.409
Husband, father
and devoted chimney sweep.

04:16.450 --> 04:19.351
I sent you to this cemetery
three years ago to visit

04:19.390 --> 04:21.915
the graves of some of New York's
most infamous murder victims,

04:21.960 --> 04:23.848
and you returned with selfies

04:23.890 --> 04:25.585
taken in front
of the grave of a man

04:25.630 --> 04:27.393
who died falling off a ladder.

04:27.430 --> 04:28.192
I thought it's funny,

04:28.230 --> 04:31.427
you two having
the same weird name.

04:31.470 --> 04:33.062
You're hardly in a position
to mock other people's names.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.534
Or are you no longer
going by Kitty?

04:35.570 --> 04:37.401
Changed your hair.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.067
Lose a bet?

04:39.110 --> 04:42.307
You believe Cy Durning
was murdered?

04:42.350 --> 04:43.942
I do.

04:43.980 --> 04:46.414
If I'm right,
he won't be the last.

04:48.380 --> 04:51.781
*

05:23.590 --> 05:24.784
I'm home!

05:24.820 --> 05:26.788
HOLMES:
In the study.

05:26.820 --> 05:28.617
You were right about
Gunther Klecko's gun.

05:28.660 --> 05:30.628
It was right where
you said it would be.

05:30.660 --> 05:32.525
I've never seen
so many cops so unhappy

05:32.560 --> 05:35.393
about finding a murder weapon.

05:35.430 --> 05:37.990
Watson, you remember Kitty.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.364
Kitty, oh, my God,
what are you doing here?

05:45.440 --> 05:47.408
I'm still not a hugger, Watson.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.135
Why didn't you tell me
she was coming?

05:49.180 --> 05:50.147
She didn't tell
anyone she was coming.

05:50.180 --> 05:52.546
She wanted to keep
her whereabouts a secret.

05:52.580 --> 05:54.810
Why? What's going on?

05:54.850 --> 05:56.738
She thinks that my
former colleague,

05:56.790 --> 05:58.485
Cy Durning, was murdered.

05:58.520 --> 06:01.557
She also thinks
that she and I might be next.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.088
KITTY: His name'_s E|i Kotite.
He's American.

06:06.130 --> 06:08.496
He's a bond trader
here in New York.

06:08.530 --> 06:09.929
About three and a half
years ago,

06:09.970 --> 06:12.894
he was in London on business
and he struck a jogger

06:12.940 --> 06:15.135
with his car
and then fled the scene.

06:15.170 --> 06:17.138
HOLMES: Seven years prior
to that, that same woman

06:17.170 --> 06:20.799
that he hit had been wounded in
the London Underground bombings.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.172
After almost losing her leg,
she'd recovered to the point

06:23.210 --> 06:25.007
where she could run marathons;
her death at the hands

06:25.050 --> 06:28.144
of a careless_motorist
seemed especnally cruel,

06:28.180 --> 06:29.989
so the search to identify him

06:30.020 --> 06:31.044
became this cause clbre.

06:31.090 --> 06:32.785
Sherlock had started
training me to be a detective

06:32.820 --> 06:35.015
just a few weeks earlier;
he thought I could help.

06:35.060 --> 06:36.925
He called it
"a case on training wheels."

06:36.960 --> 06:37.949
Took me about a week,

06:37.990 --> 06:39.526
but I found a trail

06:39.560 --> 06:40.629
that led right to Kotite.

06:40.660 --> 06:42.560
He was in London on his trip.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.965
Got pissed in some pub
and then forgot

06:44.000 --> 06:46.127
what side of the road
he was supposed to be on.

06:46.170 --> 06:47.967
HOLMES: We took everything
that we had to Scotland Yard.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.969
When the case went to trial,
we both testified.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.602
Kotite was found guilty,

06:52.640 --> 06:54.699
sentenced to four years
in prison.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.708
He got out two months ago--
good behavior.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.842
And that's when
it started happening.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.939
What started happening?

06:59.980 --> 07:03.882
The barrister who defended him
committed suicide.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.013
Couple of weeks later,
the magistrate

07:06.050 --> 07:08.848
who presided over the trial
was killed in a car accident.

07:08.890 --> 07:10.926
HOLMES: Then, three days ago,
Cy Durning,

07:10.960 --> 07:12.598
who prosecuted him, dropped dead

07:12.630 --> 07:14.621
of an apparent heart attack
in New Jersey.

07:14.660 --> 07:16.628
_ First two cases
didn't make the American papers,

07:16.670 --> 07:18.695
or I might've spotted
the pattern.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.062
Wait a second.
You think that this guy Kotite

07:21.100 --> 07:22.636
killed three people
and then managed

07:22.670 --> 07:24.763
to make it look like
something else each time?

07:24.810 --> 07:28.109
The killer is almost
certainly not Kotite.

07:28.140 --> 07:30.745
He's a paraplegic.
Well, he is now.

07:30.780 --> 07:32.668
If you have to spend time
in a British prison,

07:32.720 --> 07:34.210
it's best not to be an American.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.639
Even better to not be
an American who's killed a Brit.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.749
HOLMES: He was beaten
early in his incarceration

07:38.790 --> 07:40.985
by two other inmates, and
that left him wheelchair-bound.

07:41.020 --> 07:42.885
Now, if Kitty is right
about these recent deaths,

07:42.930 --> 07:44.750
and there's more to them
than meets the eye,

07:44.790 --> 07:46.519
it's likely
that he's hired someone

07:46.560 --> 07:49.097
to do the killing for him.

07:49.130 --> 07:50.995
Just as it's likely
there are more deaths to come.

07:51.030 --> 07:53.635
Ours, for example, seeing as
we're the ones who put him away.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.638
I mean, I get
why he'd be motivated

07:55.670 --> 07:58.059
to pick off people
that were involved in his trial,

07:58.110 --> 07:59.600
but according to these articles,

07:59.640 --> 08:01.676
the first death
was ruled a suicide,

08:01.710 --> 08:03.803
and the second
was ruled an aCCIdent.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.499
KITTY:
No evidence of foul play

08:05.550 --> 08:06.778
in either.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.913
What if the killer is that good?

08:08.950 --> 08:10.838
We won't know _
unless we look Into It.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.858
HOLMES: Two of the cases
are not only cold,

08:12.890 --> 08:14.187
they're also
thousands of miles away.

08:14.220 --> 08:15.756
That leaves Cy Durning,

08:15.790 --> 08:18.020
who did us the favor
of dying in New Jersey.

08:18.060 --> 08:19.857
The captain has contacts there.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.788
So while you and Kitty
ask him for help

08:21.830 --> 08:22.899
in gathering materials,

08:22.930 --> 08:26.127
I'm going to look into
Kotite's recent activities.

08:29.970 --> 08:32.200
You want me and Kitty

08:32.240 --> 08:33.537
to talk to the captain?

08:33.580 --> 08:34.706
Is that a problem?

08:34.740 --> 08:35.707
Yeah, Watson.

08:35.740 --> 08:37.105
Problem?

08:37.150 --> 08:39.004
You didn't just leave New York
two years ago, you fled.

08:39.050 --> 08:41.075
You dunked some guy's head
in a vat of acid.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.611
Del Gruner wasn't a
"guy," he was a monster.

08:43.650 --> 08:45.789
All things considered,
I'd say he got off easy.

08:45.820 --> 08:47.913
All I'm saying is
the captain knew it was you.

08:47.960 --> 08:48.915
HOLMES:
He suspected.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.087
Gruner never said a word
about who marked him.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.620
Obviously,
he didn't want to reveal

08:52.660 --> 08:54.196
his true connection to Kitty.

08:54.230 --> 08:56.790
You really think that's gonna
matter to the captain?

08:58.100 --> 08:59.761
I wrote him a letter.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.267
The captain,
after I got back.

09:01.300 --> 09:02.938
I didn't confess
to anything--

09:02.970 --> 09:04.767
I knew that would
put him In a spot--

09:04.810 --> 09:09.179
I just... apologized
ifI disappointed him.

09:09.210 --> 09:11.178
We're square.

09:11.210 --> 09:13.542
You heard her. They're square.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.843
You're sure about this?

09:18.890 --> 09:20.289
Pretty sure.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.185
What do you mean,
you're pretty sure?

09:22.220 --> 09:24.688
I mean, I'm reasonably certain
he won't try to charge me

09:24.730 --> 09:28.325
with a two-year-old crime.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.191
KITI'Y:
60/40.

09:30.230 --> 09:32.630
Ish.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.606
Are you kidding me?

09:42.910 --> 09:45.777
How come no one_told me
you were comIng?

09:48.820 --> 09:50.708
It's sort of a long
story, actually.

09:50.750 --> 09:51.910
Oh, yeah?

09:51.950 --> 09:53.986
I could use your help.

09:54.020 --> 09:56.352
Okay, come on.

09:56.390 --> 09:58.028
We'll talk in my office.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.894
Must've been
one hell of a letter.

10:02.930 --> 10:04.090
Yep.

10:04.130 --> 10:05.768
I don't know.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.631
Two M.E.s in London
and one in New Jersey

10:07.670 --> 10:08.932
missing three murders?

10:08.970 --> 10:10.733
Odds seem pretty slim.

10:10.770 --> 10:13.705
No one would be happier if
I'm wrong, but if I'm right

10:13.740 --> 10:16.004
and an assassin has made his way
from England to America,

10:16.040 --> 10:17.940
then Sherlock and I
could be in danger.

10:20.380 --> 10:22.746
I'll make some calls.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.645
You'll have all the help you
need from the police in Jersey.

10:25.690 --> 10:26.850
But first,

10:26.890 --> 10:28.949
I'm gonna go find Marcus.

10:28.990 --> 10:30.787
I know he's gonna want

10:30.830 --> 10:32.889
to say hi to you.

10:37.230 --> 10:39.892
So, what've you been up to
the last two years?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.828
Bit of this, bit of that.

10:43.810 --> 10:47.132
There's a group in London
that fights human trafficking.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.774
I started working for
them as an investigator.

10:49.810 --> 10:52.370
I look for girls who've been
sold into the sex trade,

10:52.410 --> 10:55.811
I find them, and I bring
them home to their families.

10:55.850 --> 10:57.408
That's amazing.

10:57.450 --> 11:00.112
Oh, I take on the occasional
private client as well.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.218
(phone chimes)

11:01.260 --> 11:03.148
Uh, so, what room
does Sherlock

11:03.190 --> 11:04.987
have you set up in
at the brownstone?

11:05.030 --> 11:07.453
Uh, I'm not staying
at the brownstone.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.764
Oh. You're not?

11:09.800 --> 11:11.722
I didn't want to
put you lot out.

11:11.770 --> 11:12.862
I mean, you do remember

11:12.900 --> 11:14.891
how many spare rooms
we have there, right?

11:14.940 --> 11:17.238
So, where are you staying?

11:17.270 --> 11:18.407
Friend's.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.464
Oh, which friend?

11:19.510 --> 11:21.478
(phone chimes)

11:21.510 --> 11:23.808
I have to go.

11:23.850 --> 11:24.908
What, now?

11:24.950 --> 11:26.406
Something's come up.
It can't wait.

11:26.450 --> 11:28.338
The captain just said he was
gonna come back with Marcus.

11:28.380 --> 11:30.712
Just give him my best,
will you?

11:33.890 --> 11:35.881
*

11:54.140 --> 11:55.869
Mr. Kotite.

11:55.910 --> 11:57.878
And you are?

11:57.910 --> 12:00.344
I'm surprised you don't
remember me. Sherlock Holmes.

12:00.380 --> 12:02.439
(chuckles)
You're the detective

12:02.480 --> 12:05.017
who meddled in my case
in London three years ago.

12:05.050 --> 12:07.109
It's a case
that deserved meddling.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.856
You hit a woman with your car,
and then sped off,

12:09.890 --> 12:11.824
and left her to die
in the street.

12:11.860 --> 12:12.929
I don't know how
you got In here,

12:12.960 --> 12:14.791
_but this is
a prIvate club, so...

12:14.830 --> 12:16.889
Of which my father is
a very influential member--

12:16.930 --> 12:18.363
has been most of his life.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.437
He also heads up an extremely
powerful, evil cabal.

12:21.470 --> 12:23.301
I can do no wrong
within these walls.

12:23.340 --> 12:25.035
What do you want?

12:25.070 --> 12:27.004
This morning,
I attended the funeral

12:27.040 --> 12:29.907
of a mutual acquaintance,
Cy Durning.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.542
Imagine my surprise
to find out

12:31.580 --> 12:34.378
he's the third person
involved in your prosecution

12:34.420 --> 12:36.149
to recently die.

12:36.180 --> 12:38.387
What can I say?
Dreams really do come true.

12:38.420 --> 12:39.910
Especially when
they're entrusted

12:39.960 --> 12:42.451
to high-priced assassins.
Excuse me.

12:42.490 --> 12:44.355
You and I must be reading
different newspapers.

12:44.390 --> 12:46.995
It's my understanding that
there's been one suicide,

12:47.030 --> 12:49.863
one car accident,
one heart attack.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.458
Certainly made to look that way.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.889
When my case

12:53.940 --> 12:55.965
went to trial,
my defense attorney,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.401
Tom Saunders,
revealed himself to be inept.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.931
The judge who oversaw
the whole thing

13:01.980 --> 13:04.107
couldn't have been more biased,
and your buddy,

13:04.150 --> 13:07.210
Mr. Durning, took advantage
of the situation

13:07.250 --> 13:09.912
to raise his _
own po|ItIcal profIIe.

13:09.950 --> 13:11.110
Thanks to them,
I'm gonna spend

13:11.150 --> 13:13.015
the rest of my life
in this chair.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.153
If you're saying that
there's some confusion

13:15.190 --> 13:18.921
about the true causes
of their deaths...

13:18.960 --> 13:22.259
I suggest you consider karma.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.392
(door closes)

13:29.440 --> 13:31.431
How'd it go?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.038
Mr. Kotite's
difficult to read.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.048
Name me a sociopath
who isn't.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.479
He was aware
of the three deaths,

13:38.510 --> 13:40.341
but did not
take responsibility.

13:40.380 --> 13:43.417
So, we're still not sure
we're looking at three murders.

13:43.450 --> 13:44.986
Is this all that
you and Kitty

13:45.020 --> 13:47.409
managed to find regarding
Cy Durning's passing?

13:47.460 --> 13:49.883
No one in Jersey thought
there was foul play, remember?

13:49.930 --> 13:52.524
So that means no case file,
no CSU reports.

13:52.560 --> 13:55.290
None of the usual haystacks
to search for needles.

13:55.330 --> 13:57.366
No, but funny you should
mention needles.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.164
These were taken by
the medicolegal investigator

14:00.200 --> 14:02.259
before Durning's body was
removed from his home.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.608
Look at his shoelaces.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.164
On the right shoe,
the knot begins

14:05.210 --> 14:07.337
with the outside lace being
fed under the inside one.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.335
On the left shoe,

14:08.380 --> 14:09.972
it's the opposite.

14:10.010 --> 14:11.546
The knots are mirror images
of each other.

14:11.580 --> 14:12.945
So, that could mean...

14:12.980 --> 14:14.117
One of his shoes
was tied for him?

14:14.150 --> 14:16.038
It's just a theory,
but it's possible

14:16.080 --> 14:17.889
somebody subdued him,
took off one of his shoes,

14:17.920 --> 14:19.285
injected something
between his toes

14:19.320 --> 14:22.187
to cause a heart attack, and
then put the shoe back on.

14:22.220 --> 14:25.018
HOLMES: The M.E. classified
the death as natural,

14:25.060 --> 14:27.597
and did not mention any
puncture wounds in her report.

14:27.630 --> 14:29.894
Yeah, it's possible
she could've missed it,

14:29.930 --> 14:32.262
but the only way to know
for sure is to exhume the body.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.131
I'll reach out to the captain.

14:34.170 --> 14:35.364
I already did. He said no.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.300
He doesn't think
there's enough evidence

14:37.340 --> 14:39.262
to even broach the subject
with his family.

14:39.310 --> 14:41.232
Well, then we'll find some.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.248
Does Kitty seem
a little off to you?

14:47.280 --> 14:48.645
A little, I don't know,

14:48.680 --> 14:50.113
tightly wound?

14:50.150 --> 14:51.617
Good detectives should
be tightly wound,

14:51.650 --> 14:54.084
especially one whose
life may be in danger.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.008
Uh, well, today,
after the captain said

14:56.060 --> 14:57.652
he was gonna help us,
she took off.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.658
She didn't even wait
to say hi to Marcus.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.123
Did she also neglect
to wipe her feet

15:01.160 --> 15:02.457
when she entered the precinct?

15:02.500 --> 15:04.195
I am serious.

15:04.230 --> 15:06.289
It's why you're serious
that puzzles me.

15:06.330 --> 15:09.197
Well, the last time
we saw Kitty, she lied to us.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.105
She said she was
going back to London,

15:11.140 --> 15:13.074
but actually she was here
in New York, hunting Del Gruner.

15:13.110 --> 15:14.532
She almost killed him.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.571
You think she might be
stalking new prey?

15:16.610 --> 15:18.498
I don't know what she's doing,
but it'd be nice to know

15:18.550 --> 15:19.505
we're not being
manipulated again.

15:19.550 --> 15:21.245
I mean, what do you know
about what she's been

15:21.280 --> 15:22.474
up to the last two years?

15:22.520 --> 15:23.589
Nothing.

15:23.620 --> 15:24.587
What do you mean, "nothing"?

15:24.620 --> 15:26.042
I mean nothing.

15:26.090 --> 15:27.216
How could you not know anything?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.215
She was your friend.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.659
She was my protg.

15:29.690 --> 15:32.181
Her departure from my life
was only a matter of time.

15:32.230 --> 15:33.492
I'm just saying.

15:33.530 --> 15:35.088
She's a detective
now, Watson,

15:35.130 --> 15:36.552
so she's one of us.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.091
She needs our help,
we give it to her.

15:39.130 --> 15:40.290
It's as simple as that.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.267
(phone ringing)

15:51.280 --> 15:53.145
Captain?

15:53.180 --> 15:55.045
GREGSON: I'm starting to think
you and Kitty are right about

15:55.080 --> 15:57.139
there being more to Cy Durning's
death than meets the eye.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.418
Why is that?

15:58.450 --> 16:01.157
How fast can you get
to Green-Wood Cemetery?

16:01.190 --> 16:02.714
WATSON: I don't understand.
I thought you said

16:02.760 --> 16:05.581
there wasn't enough evidence
to even broach an exhumation.

16:05.630 --> 16:09.054
There wasn't.
We didn't do this.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.318
Last night, some
person or persons

16:11.370 --> 16:15.238
broke into the cemetery,
dug up Mr. Durning's coffin,

16:15.270 --> 16:18.159
and set what was
left of him on fire.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.428
Pretty sure if there was any
evidence here that proved

16:20.480 --> 16:23.142
he was murdered,
it's gone now.

16:29.750 --> 16:32.412
We can try to run some tests,
but I'm not optimistic.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.259
There's probably not
enough of the scene left

16:34.290 --> 16:37.623
to help track down
whoever did this.

16:37.660 --> 16:40.094
Digging up a grave
at this time of year

16:40.130 --> 16:43.122
would've been quite a slog,
even with that backhoe.

16:43.170 --> 16:46.025
The ground is so hard, it
would've taken at least an hour,

16:46.070 --> 16:47.492
and you're saying
no one saw anything?

16:47.540 --> 16:49.428
GREGSON: Groundskeepers
are from Laos.

16:49.470 --> 16:50.630
We had an interpreter
talk to them.

16:50.670 --> 16:52.729
They said they didn't see
anybody suspicious last night.

16:52.770 --> 16:56.103
Said the fire was already out
when they got back this morning.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.573
Sherlock talked
to Eli Kotite yesterday.

16:57.610 --> 16:58.804
That's got to be
why this happened.

16:58.850 --> 17:02.149
He got spooked, sent his
guy here to clean up.

17:02.180 --> 17:03.579
Now any evidence
that Cy Durning's death

17:03.620 --> 17:04.689
wasn't natural is gone.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.314
GREGSON: So is any doubt
I had about Kotite's guilt.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.681
You'll have the full weight of
the department behind you now.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.359
And I'll reach out to our
friends across the pond, too.

17:12.390 --> 17:13.789
KITTY: I suppose
that's something.

17:13.830 --> 17:15.798
Actually, there might be
something else.

17:15.830 --> 17:17.422
If I'm right,

17:17.470 --> 17:20.268
E|i Kotite's errand boy
dyes his hair.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.836
These hairs
are freshly shed.

17:21.870 --> 17:24.703
He must've banged his head
on the roof in the dark.

17:24.740 --> 17:27.072
Or maybe one of
the workers did.

17:27.110 --> 17:29.829
Well, you said they were Asian.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.700
These appear
to be Caucasoid.

17:31.750 --> 17:32.842
You can see they're
naturally gray

17:32.880 --> 17:36.077
at the root and then dyed red.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.839
I submit that Kotite's henchman
isn't just homicidal, he's vain.

17:38.890 --> 17:41.450
WATSON: Probably not
enough usable DNA here.

17:41.490 --> 17:45.586
I mean, there's nothing left of
the follicle for a good sample.

17:45.630 --> 17:48.098
Agreed. If we can't identify our
suspect through a database,

17:48.130 --> 17:51.566
we will have to pick
up a trail elsewhere.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.761
All right, so, we'll finish
processing the scene here.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.394
Where do you want to start?
At the scene of the crime

17:56.440 --> 17:58.761
no one thought was a crime,
Cy Durning's home.

17:58.810 --> 18:00.869
All right. I'll have
Marcus meet you there.

18:00.910 --> 18:02.775
I'll reach out to the
Bergen County Sheriff's Office,

18:02.810 --> 18:04.539
have them send a CSU team.

18:04.580 --> 18:06.502
Maybe you two
want to go talk

18:06.550 --> 18:09.849
to the ME. out in Paramus,
tell her to wake up.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.643
She missed a murder here.

18:14.860 --> 18:17.328
WILKERSON: So, as you can see,
there was significant amounts

18:17.360 --> 18:20.227
of plaque in
Mr. Durning's arteries.

18:22.230 --> 18:23.561
KITTY: That doesn't
necessarIIy mean

18:23.600 --> 18:24.794
the cause of death was...

18:24.830 --> 18:27.139
Cause was a massive
myocardIal InfarctIon.

18:27.170 --> 18:29.468
His heart was in tatters, and
it's all there in the report.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.661
KITTY: I only mean
that you can't be sure

18:31.710 --> 18:34.679
what specifically
brought on the attack.

18:34.710 --> 18:36.905
How many angels can dance
on the head of a pin?

18:36.940 --> 18:39.374
Which artery gave out,
which clot formed when,

18:39.410 --> 18:40.741
it's hard to say.

18:40.780 --> 18:42.816
There's a reason
we have a box to tIck

18:42.850 --> 18:44.818
that just says "natural causes."

18:44.850 --> 18:48.183
If you ticked the right box,
then why was his corpse dug up

18:48.220 --> 18:49.312
and burnt early this morning?

18:49.360 --> 18:51.225
I don't know.

18:51.260 --> 18:54.388
Maybe someone really hated him,
wanted to hurt his family.

18:54.430 --> 18:57.524
All I can tell you is
when I examined Mr. Durning,

18:57.570 --> 18:59.868
there were no signs
of foul play.

18:59.900 --> 19:02.289
I don't agree.
This little mark here

19:02.340 --> 19:04.558
between his second and third toe
on his right foot

19:04.610 --> 19:06.202
looks like the site

19:06.240 --> 19:07.468
of a hypodermic injection.

19:07.510 --> 19:10.172
Looks more like
a flea bite to me.

19:10.210 --> 19:11.905
Oh, that would've been
one nasty flea.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.315
KITTY: And it would've
had to have bitten him

19:13.350 --> 19:14.840
under his shoe, which he decided

19:14.880 --> 19:17.678
to tie left-handed
for the first time in his life.

19:17.720 --> 19:20.188
There are no visible effects
you would expect to see

19:20.220 --> 19:20.914
if he were poisoned.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.428
The lungs,
kidneys, sclera--

19:23.460 --> 19:24.757
they were all normal.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.280
I don't know what you think
he was injected with.

19:26.330 --> 19:27.422
WATSON:
Well, that's the problem.

19:27.460 --> 19:29.189
We'll never know
because you dIdn't order

19:29.230 --> 19:30.766
a full toxicology report.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.859
You didn't even order
a baSIc panel.

19:32.900 --> 19:36.529
Mr. Durning's arteries made him
a candidate for a double bypass.

19:36.570 --> 19:38.709
He was overweight,
he was 72 years old.

19:38.740 --> 19:40.378
And now he's a briquette.

19:40.410 --> 19:42.799
You've seen my report, ladies.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.376
I have nothing to add.

19:44.410 --> 19:48.346
Maybe you just need
to think a bit harder.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.839
(whispers):
Kitty.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.687
I need to get
back to work.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.998
She didn't miss that
injection mark, she was lying.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.964
Obviously.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.831
She barely looked either of us
in the eye the whole time.

20:09.870 --> 20:11.303
She had her arms crossed,

20:11.340 --> 20:12.807
she had her torso
faced towards the door.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.501
Yeah, she wanted us
out of there.

20:14.540 --> 20:15.973
She got what
she wanted.

20:16.010 --> 20:17.568
Yo_u should've let me
gIve her a shoeIng.

20:17.610 --> 20:19.248
You really think
that would've helped?

20:19.280 --> 20:20.315
Wouldn't have hurt.

20:20.350 --> 20:22.238
Well, me.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.646
Are you all right?

20:24.690 --> 20:27.250
I'm fine. Why?

20:27.290 --> 20:29.281
Well, you look tired.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.821
It's just jet lag.

20:30.860 --> 20:32.487
Yeah, now whose arms are folded?

20:32.530 --> 20:35.021
It's cold out here, Watson.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.459
(phone chimes)

20:39.030 --> 20:39.997
(sighs)

20:40.030 --> 20:41.861
Another errand?

20:41.900 --> 20:44.368
Let me know when you hear
from Sherlock, will you?

20:47.640 --> 20:50.029
Well, none of this
makes any sense.

20:50.080 --> 20:53.004
If Cy was murdered,
how is it nobody noticed it?

20:53.050 --> 20:56.349
Our colleagues are looking
into that as we speak.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.610
You said you remembered
the Kotite case.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.789
Oh, it got a lot of attention.

21:00.820 --> 21:03.527
After all was said and done,
all he got was four years.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.482
I mean, who would kill
three people

21:05.530 --> 21:07.452
over a four-year sentence?

21:07.500 --> 21:09.354
The last couple of months,

21:09.400 --> 21:11.994
did you or your husband
notice anything unusual?

21:12.030 --> 21:14.430
Hang-up phone calls
threatening messages,

21:14.470 --> 21:16.495
that sort of thing?
No.

21:16.540 --> 21:19.008
I... Years ago,
when Cy was still working,

21:19.040 --> 21:20.871
there was harassment like that.

21:20.910 --> 21:23.037
People were not happy
that they or their loved ones

21:23.080 --> 21:25.002
were going to prison.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.314
It was one of _the reasons
why we retIred here,

21:27.350 --> 21:29.477
to get away from that.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.317
I thought we had.

21:31.350 --> 21:34.057
The day that Cy died,

21:34.090 --> 21:35.717
what do you remember
about the day?

21:35.760 --> 21:39.548
Um, I went out to do
some grocery shopping.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.558
When I came back, I found him.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.319
He was on the floor there.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.009
He was so cold.

21:51.040 --> 21:54.532
Uh, they said that he died
right after I left.

21:56.780 --> 21:59.374
I keep thinking, if I hadn't
been in such a rush,

21:59.410 --> 22:00.877
I could've been there for him.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.388
I could've called
the paramedics.

22:03.420 --> 22:04.819
But if what you're
saying is true...

22:04.850 --> 22:06.408
The person who did this

22:06.450 --> 22:08.418
might've been waiting for you
to leave that day.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.623
Um, did you happen to notice
anyone strange in the area?

22:11.660 --> 22:14.049
That day, I...

22:14.100 --> 22:17.319
It-It's something
of a blur, honestly.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.090
HOLMES: There is some
evidence which suggests,

22:20.130 --> 22:22.496
uh, the person
we're looking for

22:22.540 --> 22:23.837
may have short, cropped hair.

22:23.870 --> 22:25.667
Dyed red.

22:25.710 --> 22:27.837
Might be a bit older.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.677
Yes, I...

22:29.710 --> 22:31.974
A man just like that
was standing right outside,

22:32.010 --> 22:33.739
there on the sidewalk.

22:33.780 --> 22:36.510
He smiled at me as I drove away.

22:36.550 --> 22:38.381
And what else do you
remember about him?

22:39.890 --> 22:42.085
GREGSON:
How sure are we this is our guy?

22:42.120 --> 22:43.155
BELL: Mrs. Durning
said that's who she saw

22:43.190 --> 22:44.623
when she left the house
right before

22:44.660 --> 22:45.979
her husband's heart attack.

22:46.030 --> 22:47.850
She also remembered
he was carryIng a brIefcase.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.959
Good bet it contained
a hypodermic needle

22:50.000 --> 22:51.695
and whatever tools he needed
to break into the Durning home.

22:51.730 --> 22:53.095
BELL: Local PD are
circulating the sketch,

22:53.130 --> 22:54.859
but we're gonna
take it over

22:54.900 --> 22:56.595
to the morgue in
Paramus personally,

22:56.640 --> 22:58.164
see if anyone
there saw this guy

22:58.210 --> 23:00.474
make contact with the ME.
who missed the murder.

23:00.510 --> 23:01.772
I've been trying
to get a warrant

23:01.810 --> 23:03.505
for Kotite's phone records.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.439
I'm hoping we can track
this guy down from the call

23:06.480 --> 23:08.619
that Kotite must've made
after you goosed hIm

23:08.650 --> 23:10.447
at his club yesterday.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.082
A warrant would be worthwhile,
but I can guarantee you

23:12.120 --> 23:14.156
that he did not call
his assassin after I left.

23:14.190 --> 23:16.454
Obviously, he told the guy
to go down to the cemetery

23:16.490 --> 23:17.923
to clean his mess up.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.451
He did. I just don't think
he did it over the phone.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.922
The assassin was
at the club, you see.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.622
I passed him on my way out.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.729
He didn't seem suspicious
at first, but after Mrs. Durning

23:26.770 --> 23:28.692
began to describing
the man that she saw,

23:28.740 --> 23:29.968
I realized I'd
seen him as well.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.661
Drew that sketch myself.

23:35.910 --> 23:37.901
*

23:47.120 --> 23:50.180
(phone ringing)

23:50.220 --> 23:52.188
KITTY:
Hello?

23:52.230 --> 23:55.028
No, it's okay.
It's only half past 8:00 here.

23:56.630 --> 23:59.224
I told you, I'm not sure
when I'll be back.

23:59.270 --> 24:01.534
This will take
as long as it takes.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.831
*

24:22.620 --> 24:23.985
(grunting)

24:24.030 --> 24:25.224
(glass shatters)

24:37.770 --> 24:39.169
(choking)

24:39.210 --> 24:41.007
Margaret, stop!

24:41.040 --> 24:42.234
You got my text.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.599
Yes, I did.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.539
Watson, this is Margaret.

24:46.580 --> 24:48.844
You know this woman?
Yeah, she's my friend.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.519
A very nosy friend, but she is
a friend nonetheless.

24:51.550 --> 24:52.847
I'm sorry.

24:52.890 --> 24:54.118
I didn't know.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.013
I-I thought you broke in.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.516
I thought you were
trying to take him.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.220
Take who?
Her baby.

24:59.260 --> 25:00.796
I'm his nanny.

25:00.830 --> 25:03.526
(baby crying)

25:12.310 --> 25:13.732
His name's Archie.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.577
His father_and I went
to unIverSIty together.

25:15.610 --> 25:18.147
Or at least we did before I...

25:18.180 --> 25:20.102
you know, before I had
my troubles.

25:20.150 --> 25:23.119
Ijust bumped into him
when I got back to London.

25:23.150 --> 25:25.914
It was... it was _
really nIce, wasn't It?

25:25.950 --> 25:27.815
Then we were_
together for a thIe,

25:27.860 --> 25:30.658
and then we weren't,
then we were.

25:30.690 --> 25:32.988
Archie was a surprise.

25:33.030 --> 25:34.895
But the best one I've ever had.

25:34.930 --> 25:37.728
His dad and I are on
different paths now,

25:37.770 --> 25:39.590
but when it comes to Archie,
he's been great.

25:39.630 --> 25:42.963
He's so... supportive,
and he's so present.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.639
Between him and Margaret,
I have everything I need.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.069
He's beautiful.

25:47.110 --> 25:48.304
Yes, he is.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.069
He's also very needy.

25:50.110 --> 25:51.907
When he's hungry,
he won't let anyone feed him,

25:51.950 --> 25:53.269
apart from his mum.

25:53.310 --> 25:55.141
Will you, you little monkey?

25:55.180 --> 25:57.740
So that's why you've been
sneaking off the last few days.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.179
Yeah, it's also why I've not
been getting much sleep.

26:00.220 --> 26:02.313
He's teething and so on.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.920
I would say he's
the fussiest man I've ever met,

26:04.960 --> 26:06.655
but we both know I'd be lying.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.191
Do you mind?

26:08.230 --> 26:10.357
No.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.163
What do you say, Archie?

26:12.200 --> 26:13.360
You stay agreeable
for your Aunty Watson?

26:13.400 --> 26:16.062
Hi. Hi, hi, hi.

26:16.100 --> 26:17.169
(clicks tongue)

26:17.200 --> 26:19.202
Hi.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.606
Well, you've done it now,
you've made my list of sitters.

26:21.640 --> 26:23.779
(laughs)

26:23.810 --> 26:25.243
"Aunty Watson."

26:25.280 --> 26:26.679
I like it.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.019
You know Sherlock
used to call me that?

26:29.050 --> 26:30.369
Of course, I was
"the Anti-Watson."

26:30.420 --> 26:32.945
I mean, after everything
you've been through,

26:32.990 --> 26:34.958
I mean, you're a mom now,
it's amazing.

26:34.990 --> 26:36.389
(clicks tongue)

26:36.420 --> 26:38.627
So why wouldn't you,
uh, tell us about Archie?

26:38.660 --> 26:40.082
Why keep him a secret?

26:40.130 --> 26:42.223
I know what you two are like.

26:42.260 --> 26:44.319
You're going after a man
who's financed three murders.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.793
The second you found out
I had a baby on board,

26:46.830 --> 26:48.058
you would've benched me.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.738
No.
"Noll?

26:49.770 --> 26:52.762
No, there's more to it
than that, I can tell.

26:54.910 --> 26:56.309
After all
thIs IS over,

26:56.340 --> 26:59.138
after we prove
Kotite's guilty, um...

26:59.180 --> 27:00.943
I'm quitting.

27:00.980 --> 27:02.379
Quitting?

27:02.420 --> 27:04.115
Being a detective.

27:04.150 --> 27:06.380
I'm gonna stay on with
the group I told you about,

27:06.420 --> 27:09.014
but strictly as a counselor.

27:09.060 --> 27:11.278
I just don't know how
Sherlock's gonna take it.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.218
Wait, you don't think
he'd be happy for you?

27:13.260 --> 27:15.353
He dedicated a year
of his life to me.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.890
He-he taught me,

27:16.930 --> 27:20.195
and he gave me structure,
he gave me purpose.

27:20.230 --> 27:22.289
This thing we do,
this isn't just a job to him,

27:22.340 --> 27:24.262
_ it's-it's...
It's somethIng much more,

27:24.310 --> 27:27.165
and I'm just gonna
turn my back on it.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.701
I'm just...

27:29.740 --> 27:32.140
I'm scared he's gonna
be disappointed.

27:32.180 --> 27:35.308
I mean, I understand why you'd
be nervous, but respectfully,

27:35.350 --> 27:38.239
I think you're
selling him short.

27:38.290 --> 27:41.179
I mean, he deserves to know
that you're happy.

27:42.190 --> 27:44.124
(babbles playfully)
Right?

27:52.970 --> 27:55.336
(door opens)

27:55.370 --> 27:57.065
Dr. Wilkerson,
I'm Detective Bell.

27:57.100 --> 27:58.863
You already know
my colleagues.

28:00.140 --> 28:02.734
WILKERSON: Why am I looking
at a picture of a man

28:02.780 --> 28:03.849
who was shot to death?

28:03.880 --> 28:06.178
Oh, she does recognize
a murder when she sees one.

28:06.210 --> 28:07.916
We thought
you were gonna say

28:07.950 --> 28:10.418
we're looking at the work
of the world's biggest flea.

28:10.450 --> 28:11.917
I owe you a Coke, Watson.

28:11.950 --> 28:14.259
Does that man
look familiar to you?

28:14.290 --> 28:16.258
No.

28:16.290 --> 28:18.349
So you've never seen him before?

28:18.390 --> 28:19.482
No.

28:19.530 --> 28:20.792
You're positive?

28:20.830 --> 28:22.149
Does "no" mean

28:22.200 --> 28:23.349
the same thing

28:23.400 --> 28:25.322
in New York
that it means in New Jersey?

28:25.370 --> 28:27.190
Just answer the question.

28:27.230 --> 28:30.097
I've never seen that man before.

28:30.140 --> 28:31.459
WATSON: Well, that's funny
because Detective Bell

28:31.510 --> 28:33.262
met a witness last night

28:33.310 --> 28:36.108
that says that
that man paid a visit

28:36.140 --> 28:37.209
to your morgue last week.

28:37.240 --> 28:38.502
He talked to you for a while.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.472
Our witness couldn't
make out the details,

28:40.510 --> 28:42.011
but if we had to guess,

28:42.050 --> 28:43.984
he was offering you money
to help him cover up

28:44.020 --> 28:45.317
the murder of Cy Durning.

28:45.350 --> 28:46.840
KITTY: Have you
ever heard of a man

28:46.890 --> 28:48.016
named Eli Kotite?

28:48.060 --> 28:50.153
No.

28:50.190 --> 28:51.987
Is he the man in the sketch?

28:52.030 --> 28:54.351
No, he's the man
behind the man in the sketch.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.528
BELL: See, Mr. Kotite had
an ax to grind with Cy Durning.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.358
He paid the killer,
the killer paid you.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.539
When Cy Durning turned up
on your autopsy table,

29:02.570 --> 29:04.435
you looked
the other way.

29:04.470 --> 29:06.131
Took what should've
been a homicide

29:06.170 --> 29:07.774
and called it a natural death.

29:09.010 --> 29:10.477
Nonsense.

29:12.110 --> 29:13.941
You're a terrible person,
Dr. Wilkerson.

29:13.980 --> 29:15.914
But you're not
the most terrible,

29:15.950 --> 29:17.440
_at least not
mmmwm.

29:17.480 --> 29:18.913
We want Kotite and his assassin.

29:18.950 --> 29:20.383
You tell Detective Bell here

29:20.420 --> 29:22.456
everything you know about them,
and who knows?

29:22.490 --> 29:25.254
You might dodge
a prison sentence.

29:25.290 --> 29:26.928
No.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.996
There is no witness.
You're makIng hIm up.

29:30.530 --> 29:31.929
BELL: The day you
met with the man

29:31.970 --> 29:33.562
in the sketch,
you had a coffee stain

29:33.600 --> 29:35.431
on your lab coat, right here.

29:35.470 --> 29:38.268
Does that sound like
a detail we made up?

29:38.310 --> 29:40.107
Are you arresting me?

29:40.140 --> 29:41.573
No, not yet.

29:41.610 --> 29:42.702
Then I'm leaving.

29:42.740 --> 29:46.346
You should know, Dr. Wilkerson,
we are seeking a warrant

29:46.380 --> 29:48.416
for your financial records
as we speak.

29:48.450 --> 29:50.543
If there's a money trail
between you and Eli Kotite,

29:50.580 --> 29:52.241
we will find it.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.917
If you're luclq,
we'll get it before

29:53.960 --> 29:56.451
he has his man_ _
pay you a second VISIt.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.427
You're quite certain
this is everything?

30:07.470 --> 30:08.232
Everything so far.

30:08.270 --> 30:09.965
The captain has
just sent through

30:10.000 --> 30:11.558
some additional
bank records.

30:11.610 --> 30:14.204
Good. 'Cause if there's
any proof In these documents

30:14.240 --> 30:16.470
that Dr. Wilkerson took a bribe
from Eli Kotite,

30:16.510 --> 30:19.070
it's doing a good job
of hiding itself.

30:21.180 --> 30:22.340
She'll be back soon.

30:22.380 --> 30:23.847
Hmm?

30:23.890 --> 30:24.982
Watson, with the food.

30:25.020 --> 30:26.339
You keep looking at your watch.

30:26.390 --> 30:28.881
I'm not hungry, actually.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.808
Wouldn't know it from
the amount of food you ordered.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.382
Who needs pizza and pasta?

30:33.430 --> 30:36.319
Here we are.

30:36.360 --> 30:39.397
Found something?

30:39.430 --> 30:42.194
Dr. Wilkerson received

30:42.240 --> 30:46.006
a $50,000 wire transfer
from a Caymanian bank

30:46.040 --> 30:50.079
not 12 hours after she signed
Cy Durning's autopsy report.

30:50.110 --> 30:52.874
You think that account
belongs to Eli Kotite?

30:52.910 --> 30:55.344
I think that, like many
slimy bond traders before him,

30:55.380 --> 30:56.517
he has multiple

30:56.550 --> 30:59.314
off-shore accounts
In the Caymans.

30:59.350 --> 31:02.217
And while their laws make the
Swiss look like chatterboxes,

31:02.260 --> 31:05.923
I think I know a way
to prove that this one's his.

31:07.360 --> 31:08.952
You say you're not
waiting for Watson,

31:09.000 --> 31:10.297
but that is
the third time

31:10.330 --> 31:12.469
you've checked your watch
in the last 30 minutes.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.229
And now that you're
standing close to me,

31:14.270 --> 31:16.238
I can tell that your heart
is virtually pounding,

31:16.270 --> 31:17.464
so is something amiss?

31:20.570 --> 31:24.301
The truth is, I've asked
someone to meet me here.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.102
That's why I've ordered
extra food.

31:26.150 --> 31:27.674
VVho?

31:27.710 --> 31:30.577
Someone I want you to meet.

31:30.620 --> 31:34.112
Someone important.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.582
(doorbell rings)

31:38.660 --> 31:40.355
Sorry we're late.

31:40.390 --> 31:42.597
The first Verdammt taxi
that came

31:42.630 --> 31:44.564
couldn't accommodate
the car seat.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.160
Sherlock Holmes.

31:47.200 --> 31:49.339
Kitty's been expecting you.

31:49.370 --> 31:52.601
It's not Margaret
I wanted you to meet.

31:53.980 --> 31:56.130
It's him.

32:02.580 --> 32:05.686
This is Archie, my son.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.052
(phone ringing)

32:12.690 --> 32:15.022
This, uh... I...

32:15.060 --> 32:16.550
Sorry, uh...

32:16.600 --> 32:18.397
EXCUSE me one moment.

32:22.170 --> 32:24.161
(phone continues ringing)

32:26.740 --> 32:28.037
Sherlock Holmes.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.674
Mr. Holmes, this is Eli Kotite.

32:30.710 --> 32:33.941
Mr. Kotite, would you believe
I was just talking about you?

32:34.720 --> 32:36.745
I think we should meet again.

32:36.780 --> 32:37.439
In person.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.448
Already in the works, actually.

32:39.490 --> 32:41.253
In fact, a large contingent
of police and I

32:41.290 --> 32:43.758
should be knocking on your door
at about 9:45 in the morning.

32:43.790 --> 32:45.655
(laughs)

32:45.690 --> 32:47.453
I-I don't understand.

32:47.490 --> 32:49.754
The bribe that you wired to the
medical examiner in New Jersey

32:49.800 --> 32:51.165
originated in Grand Cayman.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.724
Now, you might be expecting

32:52.770 --> 32:54.067
that corrupt isle
to keep your secrets,

32:54.100 --> 32:55.761
but you forget
who my father is, again.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.064
When the banks open,
the truth will out,

32:58.110 --> 32:59.634
and then your fate
will be sealed.

32:59.670 --> 33:01.069
The truth is that

33:01.110 --> 33:03.499
I had nothing to do
with those murders.

33:03.540 --> 33:05.576
You agree the deaths
were not divine providence?

33:05.610 --> 33:07.703
As a matter of fact, I do.

33:07.750 --> 33:10.048
That's why I'm calling.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.685
I think I may even know
who's behind them.

33:12.720 --> 33:14.688
Well, then, don't keep me
in suspense.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.654
This line may not be secure.

33:16.690 --> 33:19.352
Can you meet me
at the club in 30 minutes?

33:21.360 --> 33:24.124
I could, but I'd rather not.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.197
Meet me.

33:27.230 --> 33:28.697
If I can't convince you
I'm onto something,

33:28.740 --> 33:32.699
you have my word, I'll answer
every question you have,

33:32.740 --> 33:35.208
without my lavwers present.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.276
All right, 30 minutes.

33:39.710 --> 33:41.348
Sherlock...

33:41.380 --> 33:44.713
I'll be back, shortly.

33:50.090 --> 33:52.456
Glenn?

33:52.490 --> 33:54.526
Need something, sir?

33:54.560 --> 33:57.552
Bring the car around.
I'll meet you downstairs.

34:18.750 --> 34:20.741
*

34:29.830 --> 34:32.060
(loud crash)

34:50.150 --> 34:51.447
I don't think
there will be more questions,

34:51.490 --> 34:52.809
but if any come up,
I'll be in touch.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.812
In fact, there should
be many more questions.

34:57.860 --> 34:59.418
Especially regarding
the nine millimeter found

34:59.460 --> 35:01.257
on Mr. Kotite's person.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.860
I get it, okay? You don't think
this was a suicide, but...

35:03.900 --> 35:04.889
If he wanted
to kill himself,

35:04.930 --> 35:06.864
he had a much easier way
tucked in his trousers.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.367
All due respect, I don't think

35:08.400 --> 35:10.231
there's any way to prove
that shooting yourself

35:10.270 --> 35:11.862
is easier than
jumping off a building.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.537
Isn't this just
a "different strokes

35:13.570 --> 35:14.901
for different folks"
kind of deal?

35:14.940 --> 35:16.703
If he really was the
architect of three murders

35:16.740 --> 35:18.742
and he killed
himself, capital.

35:18.780 --> 35:20.873
But I spoke to him just
moments before he died,

35:20.910 --> 35:22.411
and I'm not convinced.

35:22.450 --> 35:24.509
He told you the real killer
was out there?

35:24.550 --> 35:26.211
It's not what he said,
it's how he said it.

35:26.250 --> 35:27.683
The timbre of his
mm was even,

35:27.720 --> 35:29.756
the pace was
steady, unrushed.

35:29.790 --> 35:33.578
I believe that he believed
In hIs Innocence.

35:33.630 --> 35:35.257
All right,
devil's advocate here.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.722
Killing yourself is
a pretty strong indicator

35:36.760 --> 35:38.296
of poor mental health.

35:38.330 --> 35:39.729
He wanted to meet in person
because he thought

35:39.770 --> 35:41.692
someone might be
listening in on the call.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.799
He's apparently been
carrying a gun in his belt.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.707
Agreed, all consistent
with clinical paranoia.

35:46.740 --> 35:48.401
Right, so is it really
that crazy to think

35:48.440 --> 35:50.237
that the guy was
just having a breakdown?

35:50.280 --> 35:51.770
He got his vengeance,
and he didn't want

35:51.810 --> 35:53.243
to face the consequences.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.714
What am I missing?

35:55.750 --> 35:57.240
(phone ringing)

35:57.280 --> 36:00.386
Look, if you need me,
I'll be at the precinct.

36:00.420 --> 36:01.853
HOLMES:
KItty.

36:01.890 --> 36:03.949
We're pretty sure we just found
our fourth murder

36:03.990 --> 36:05.753
that's been disguised
as something else.

36:05.790 --> 36:07.849
HOLMES: Marcus and I were just
discussing that possibility.

36:07.890 --> 36:09.790
What did you and Watson find?

36:09.830 --> 36:11.559
It's what we didn't find
that's important.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.795
It's raining now,
but the balcony's railing

36:13.830 --> 36:15.798
_ was covered in
thIs thIn layer of soot.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.899
But the thing is,
there weren't any smudges.

36:17.940 --> 36:19.828
Mr. Kotite is paralyzed
from the waist down,

36:19.870 --> 36:20.837
and his hands are clean.

36:20.870 --> 36:22.371
I'm assuming the railing is

36:22.410 --> 36:23.809
at least three
and a half feet high?

36:23.840 --> 36:25.671
Yeah, this one's nearly four.

36:25.710 --> 36:28.474
So how did he put himself over
without leaving any marks?

36:28.520 --> 36:30.875
There's nothing on the balcony
he could've grabbed hold of.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.741
Watson and I are pretty sure
that someone threw him off.

36:36.020 --> 36:38.887
So, summing up,
we're wrong about everything.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.784
E|i Kotite was not
the financier

36:40.830 --> 36:42.320
of three carefully
concealed murders,

36:42.360 --> 36:43.998
he was next in line.

36:44.030 --> 36:45.895
Maybe the assassin
he hired realized

36:45.930 --> 36:47.966
we were onto him
and got nervous.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.865
Killed Kotite to tie up
a loose end.

36:49.900 --> 36:51.663
Killers that meticulous,
they don't get nervous.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.735
And as I said before,
I believe that Kotite

36:53.770 --> 36:55.374
was telling the truth
when he said

36:55.410 --> 36:56.331
someone else
was responSIble.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.245
Shame we didn't get
to show him your sketch.

36:58.280 --> 37:00.271
We could've got a name
to go with the face.

37:00.310 --> 37:02.676
34,000 police officers
scoured the city for this man--

37:02.720 --> 37:04.244
not a nibble.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.279
Whoever he is, he's elusive.

37:05.320 --> 37:06.446
A mouse in a wall
Is eluSIve.

37:06.490 --> 37:07.980
This man's more like a goryo,

37:08.020 --> 37:09.954
sprung from Japanese folklore.

37:09.990 --> 37:11.924
Ghosts? Seriously?
Well, whoever he is,

37:11.960 --> 37:13.825
he was able to toss a man
off a building

37:13.860 --> 37:15.794
without leaving
subdermal bruising,

37:15.830 --> 37:17.491
defensive wounds, or any sign
of a hypodermic injection.

37:17.530 --> 37:18.497
KITTY:
He didn't leave a trace

37:18.530 --> 37:20.896
of himself on the lobby
security camera either.

37:20.930 --> 37:22.431
And it's pretty interesting

37:22.470 --> 37:24.267
that their system
suffered a glitch

37:24.310 --> 37:26.835
20 minutes before
Kotite took a header.

37:26.870 --> 37:29.509
Again, I offer the possibility
of a killer ghost.

37:29.540 --> 37:30.802
Actually, I think
whatever happened

37:30.840 --> 37:32.808
to that surveillance video
Is our best clue.

37:32.850 --> 37:34.272
It's an expensive system,

37:34.320 --> 37:35.776
so whoever knocked out
those cameras

37:35.820 --> 37:37.640
had to have a certain level
of technIcal sophIstIcatIon.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.614
KITTY: That's interesting,
but I don't see

37:39.650 --> 37:41.754
how that helps with
where to look for a culprit.

37:42.820 --> 37:44.629
(siren whoops)

37:44.660 --> 37:46.924
(indistinct police
radio chatter)

37:50.960 --> 37:52.962
I think I'll start
the search in our library.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.036
What the hell?

37:55.070 --> 37:58.267
Go. Get her somewhere safe,
somewhere off the grid.

37:59.770 --> 38:01.533
What, you think
they're looking for me?

38:01.580 --> 38:02.877
I think that they're
government agents,

38:02.910 --> 38:04.309
and they managed
to violate our home

38:04.350 --> 38:05.601
without triggering
any of the alarms,

38:05.650 --> 38:06.878
and that suggests
a certain level

38:06.910 --> 38:08.810
of technical sophistication,
don't you?

38:08.850 --> 38:10.943
Wait, you think the government
is behind everything?

38:10.980 --> 38:12.948
There's a way to find out.

38:20.630 --> 38:22.621
(urgent chatter)

38:31.000 --> 38:33.036
Who's in charge here?

38:33.070 --> 38:36.073
Mr. Holmes.

38:36.110 --> 38:38.578
Just the man
I've been looking for.

38:38.610 --> 38:40.646
I could say the same thing.

38:46.490 --> 38:49.857
I'm Anson Gephardt. I work for
the Defense Intelligence Agency.

38:49.890 --> 38:51.926
I'm here to place you
under arrest.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.086
On what grounds?

38:53.130 --> 38:55.348
All will be made clear,
Mr. Holmes.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.824
