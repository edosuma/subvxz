she doesn't want
to hang out with me.

39:58.867 --> 40:01.066
One time, we were at church.
She came up to me, she was like,

40:01.066 --> 40:03.166
"How are you?"
as if, like, I didn't know you.

40:03.166 --> 40:05.033
And I was like, "Oh, my God,
I have, like, two seats next

40:05.033 --> 40:07.033
to me, why don't you and
your friend come sit with us?"

40:07.033 --> 40:09.667
She goes, "No."
It was...

40:09.667 --> 40:11.000
(Kourtney laughs)
...so awkward.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.333
We have awkward moments

>> KENDALL: What if, like, you

40:21.400 --> 40:25.133
stay in it, like, 21 minutes,
and it doesn't come off anymore?

40:25.133 --> 40:26.934
(chuckles)
>> KOURTNEY: Oh, my gosh.

40:26.934 --> 40:29.333
I would die.
Make sure it's really

40:29.333 --> 40:37.633
on my butt.
>> KENDALL: This is insane.

40:37.633 --> 40:41.200

>> KENDALL: Okay, I think

40:41.200 --> 40:48.033
I'm done.
