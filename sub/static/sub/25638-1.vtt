00:30.083 --> 00:33.291
<i>All landing ships have been annihilated.</i>
<i>Remaining forces unknown.</i>

00:36.291 --> 00:37.666
<i>The operation was a success!</i>

00:38.000 --> 00:40.750
<i>But suddenly... a different Godzilla...</i>

00:42.750 --> 00:44.625
Hereafter, all communication was lost.

00:47.041 --> 00:49.166
Where's the analysis of the gathered data?

00:49.666 --> 00:52.083
This was the last recorded video.
Displaying now.

00:53.750 --> 00:54.625
B-But how...

00:55.125 --> 00:59.333
Estimated height, about 300 meters?

00:59.416 --> 01:00.250
That's too large!

01:00.458 --> 01:01.916
This has to be a mistake.

01:02.625 --> 01:03.833
Comparing with database.

01:05.583 --> 01:07.875
More than 98% match with past data.

01:10.708 --> 01:13.333
This Godzilla is indeed the one.

01:13.666 --> 01:16.125
It's continued to grow for 20,000 years?

01:16.625 --> 01:18.333
Is it immortal?

01:19.041 --> 01:20.666
Captain Mori, what should we do?

01:22.250 --> 01:24.125
We can't return to this planet anymore. We'll plan for the next inhabitable...

01:26.625 --> 01:29.166
Before that, what if it notices this ship?

01:29.958 --> 01:33.750
Controller, if that enormous Godzilla
were to fire its heat ray,

01:34.041 --> 01:35.458
how much power would it emit?

01:35.541 --> 01:37.583
I'll convert it from the estimated output.

01:39.625 --> 01:42.500
I-It will pierce the atmosphere,
and reach this ship.

01:44.541 --> 01:48.416
Although I believe the probability
that it'll notice us is low.

01:48.708 --> 01:51.541
We need to withdraw
from Earth's satellite orbit at once,

01:51.625 --> 01:53.375
and retreat to the moon's orbit.

01:53.458 --> 01:56.583
-Then we can't send rescue ships!
-They've all been annihilated!

01:56.791 --> 01:58.958
There should be a possibility
of survivors.

01:59.625 --> 02:03.250
We Exif are opposed to the idea
of abandoning survivors.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.166
We'll use drones
to search for the landing team.

02:07.250 --> 02:08.416
We don't have time!

02:08.500 --> 02:10.666
-It's the captain's decision!
-On what basis?

02:11.041 --> 02:15.708
However, if we don't find any survivors
within 48 hours...

02:17.333 --> 02:19.000
we will withdraw from Earth.

03:03.333 --> 03:10.291
CITY ON THE EDGE OF BATTLE

03:45.125 --> 03:46.000
I can move.

03:47.291 --> 03:49.833
I can breathe. What's going on?

03:52.166 --> 03:53.000
Where am I?

03:53.583 --> 03:54.541
A human's house?

03:56.375 --> 03:57.208
Why?

04:06.125 --> 04:08.333
Wireless and positioning system
are out, huh?

04:13.125 --> 04:16.375
Looks like this isn't Heaven nor Hell.

04:28.208 --> 04:30.125
Can it be? Did humanity survive?

04:33.500 --> 04:34.958
Hey, wait! Please wait!

04:35.333 --> 04:36.166
Hey!

04:48.208 --> 04:50.458
The fog won't descend.

05:07.125 --> 05:08.125
Where did you go?

05:12.750 --> 05:13.583
Hey!

05:14.416 --> 05:15.250
Please wait!

05:18.500 --> 05:20.125
Is she fine in this atmosphere?

05:24.958 --> 05:27.541
After 20,000 years,
adaptation wouldn't be unexpected.

05:31.333 --> 05:32.166
Damn it.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.083
I need to report to the mother ship.

05:36.666 --> 05:38.583
Maybe the landing ship's communicator...

05:42.958 --> 05:44.750
it only knows the general direction.

06:04.416 --> 06:06.083
I wonder where Metphies is. Yuko... Adam.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.500
If I chase, she retreats.
If I retreat, she chases, huh?

06:33.333 --> 06:34.416
Heat source detected?

06:35.416 --> 06:36.666
Might be the landing ship.

06:51.041 --> 06:51.875
Hey! It talked!

06:59.083 --> 06:59.958
Watch out?

07:13.875 --> 07:15.583
Thank you for helping me.

07:25.833 --> 07:27.458
I am Haruo.

07:29.375 --> 07:30.208
Hey.

07:30.666 --> 07:31.500
What?

07:32.375 --> 07:33.375
Uh, I mean...

07:34.458 --> 07:38.333
I'm Haruo. Ha-ru-o.

07:40.125 --> 07:44.291
Ha. Ru. Oi.

07:45.708 --> 07:48.083
Yes. I'm Haruo. And you're?

07:50.375 --> 07:51.208
This sound.

07:52.833 --> 07:54.625
Hey, wait!

07:55.125 --> 07:57.750
Are there others?
Other humans that survived!

08:01.458 --> 08:04.458
<i>This is Master Sergeant Yuko Tani</i>
<i>and three more. Anyone out there?</i>

08:04.791 --> 08:06.208
Yuko? Is that you?

08:07.291 --> 08:09.000
<i>Haruo? Is this Haruo?</i>

08:09.083 --> 08:11.083
You're alive? Who else is there?

08:11.583 --> 08:13.750
<i>I'm with Adam, Major Belu-be, and...</i>

08:14.708 --> 08:16.458
Yuko? Yuko!

08:19.083 --> 08:20.083
So it's that way?

08:20.625 --> 08:22.833
I got through to Captain Sakaki
for a moment!

08:23.291 --> 08:24.500
He's alive!

08:24.583 --> 08:26.583
Not now, Master Sergeant Tani.

08:29.833 --> 08:32.166
Hey, did you really see it?

08:32.250 --> 08:35.458
I did! They were rushing toward me
really fast from the forest!

08:50.666 --> 08:53.041
What is that? It went through the armor!

08:55.833 --> 08:56.791
One more shot.

08:57.208 --> 08:58.333
I don't want to die.

09:10.125 --> 09:10.958
I did it!

09:11.958 --> 09:12.916
Let's verify it.

09:23.416 --> 09:26.958
It's a human no matter how you look at it.

09:27.916 --> 09:30.250
This pattern is somewhat...

09:38.541 --> 09:39.875
Already that far...

09:45.458 --> 09:46.875
-Stop!
-Haruo?

09:47.333 --> 09:48.166
Stop it! Hey!

09:58.250 --> 09:59.083
Are you okay?

10:00.125 --> 10:01.875
Haruo! Please get away!

10:02.125 --> 10:03.541
Wait, Yuko. Calm down!

10:04.041 --> 10:07.708
Captain Sakaki,
we were just under attack by that.

10:07.791 --> 10:09.375
-What?
-It's true, Haruo.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.833
We were just fighting a battle with her.

10:12.083 --> 10:15.083
R-Ridiculous! She's been with me this--

10:15.166 --> 10:18.541
Regardless, we will get that creature
in restraints. Adam!

10:19.833 --> 10:21.500
O-Oh, I ran out of...

10:23.500 --> 10:24.333
What?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
What's going on?

10:29.083 --> 10:32.000
Damn it. We're completely surrounded.

10:32.875 --> 10:35.083
This many have survived?

10:41.875 --> 10:43.666
We shouldn't provoke them.

10:44.291 --> 10:47.291
Yeah. And we're all out of bullets.

11:52.875 --> 11:55.541
An underground kingdom?

11:57.125 --> 11:58.625
It's just like an ants' nest.

11:59.208 --> 12:01.500
So this is where they continued to live.

12:02.166 --> 12:03.166
Amazing.

12:09.541 --> 12:10.625
-Hey!
-Wait!

12:11.250 --> 12:12.083
Let us out!

12:15.625 --> 12:17.125
Hey! Glad you made it!

12:17.208 --> 12:18.041
Professor!

12:18.541 --> 12:21.208
Everyone,
it's safe to retract your helmets.

12:21.833 --> 12:24.541
This atmosphere is the same as it was
20,000 years ago.

12:26.916 --> 12:28.458
I'm glad everyone's safe.

12:28.708 --> 12:30.208
-Captain!
-Captain Sakaki!

12:31.041 --> 12:31.875
Captain!

12:34.166 --> 12:35.500
Belu-be, you're all right.

12:35.791 --> 12:38.250
Lieutenant Colonel Galu-gu,
glad you're safe, too.

12:39.666 --> 12:41.791
You and everyone else were captured, too?

12:41.875 --> 12:44.666
Yes. We were surrounded by a large number.

12:45.208 --> 12:46.208
Where's Metphies?

12:46.416 --> 12:48.291
Unfortunately, he's not here.

12:52.958 --> 12:54.750
This is great air.

12:56.375 --> 13:00.125
Those people were okay
with the forest's air.

13:00.583 --> 13:03.458
It looks like their lungs
work sufficiently in the open air,

13:03.541 --> 13:05.916
but fundamentally
it must be close to ours.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.125
So does that mean they're humanity's...

13:08.208 --> 13:10.541
descendants, is what you want to say?

13:10.625 --> 13:12.750
That might be jumping to conclusion.

13:12.875 --> 13:16.125
But based on how they look,
they can't be anything but human.

13:16.208 --> 13:18.958
They had powder-like substances
spouting from their skin.

13:20.041 --> 13:21.541
Could it be their scales?

13:22.291 --> 13:25.166
Perhaps they could have evolved
from insects.

13:25.750 --> 13:26.583
Hey, a moment.

13:26.875 --> 13:29.875
It's difficult to call them humanoids
based on our definition.

13:30.125 --> 13:31.291
What do you mean?

13:31.750 --> 13:34.833
Their scientific strengths
have not reached proper standards.

13:35.083 --> 13:39.833
Even if they were your descendants,
this is not evolution, but degeneration.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.625
What are you trying to say?

13:41.708 --> 13:45.708
We should only be thinking about
how to escape this place.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.583
Even if we must kill this race.

13:48.791 --> 13:52.791
In any case,
I wonder what they want to do with us?

13:52.958 --> 13:56.708
W-Well,
I don't think they want to kill us.

13:57.041 --> 13:58.291
How do you know that?

13:58.708 --> 14:01.583
They treated all of our wounded.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.458
Is that true?
Actually, I was also treated by...

14:04.541 --> 14:06.666
They could use us for sacrifice.

14:07.791 --> 14:08.708
Look at the walls.

14:10.291 --> 14:13.958
This looks like a graveyard.
Maybe we'll end up like that, too.

14:14.500 --> 14:17.666
If they wanted to kill us,
they wouldn't bring us to their village.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.083
I hope that's true.

14:20.833 --> 14:23.750
So Captain Sakaki, what should we do?

14:24.541 --> 14:26.875
-Captain!
-Captain Sakaki!

14:27.333 --> 14:29.458
You're still the commander.

14:32.208 --> 14:36.291
<i>Run, Haruo.</i>
<i>Do as your soul cries out to do.</i>

14:39.333 --> 14:42.000
We need to somehow escape,
and contact the mother ship.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.833
I found a signal in the forest
almost matching a landing ship.

14:45.416 --> 14:48.500
But I thought all landing ships
were destroyed by its attacks.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.458
Adam's flying unit should still remain.

14:51.958 --> 14:54.666
Yeah, that's true, but...

14:55.000 --> 14:56.541
we can't fly on those things.

14:56.875 --> 14:58.833
We just need to contact the mother ship.

14:59.083 --> 15:01.750
Then we'll procure weapons and food
from the wreckage.

15:01.833 --> 15:05.875
Weapons? Captain Sakaki,
don't tell me you still want to fight it?

15:09.333 --> 15:10.166
You're... Is this...

15:20.625 --> 15:21.875
Some kind of ritual?

15:22.833 --> 15:24.208
For sacrifices?

15:24.291 --> 15:25.708
Give me a break.

15:35.250 --> 15:36.583
Their faces are the same.

15:36.666 --> 15:38.250
They were twins?

15:43.708 --> 15:45.458
Give praise to the Egg.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.458
For the darkness of the land
is the Houtua's tranquility.

15:50.083 --> 15:54.083
For the light of twilight shall cleanse
the vengeance beyond our gaze.

15:55.916 --> 15:58.791
Is this a type of telepathy?

15:59.708 --> 16:02.083
Why do they know humanity's language?

16:02.500 --> 16:06.083
No, for us,
we hear Bilusaludo's mother language.

16:06.500 --> 16:10.125
Apparently,
our brains are changing the language.

16:11.583 --> 16:16.125
Borrowing the Egg's song,
we ask the Passing Crows.

16:17.041 --> 16:19.625
Lend your ears to the Baby Chick.

16:20.541 --> 16:22.958
This be the question from the Egg.

16:23.916 --> 16:27.000
It is ours, the Houtua's, collective song.

16:27.416 --> 16:28.250
Baby Chick?

16:29.000 --> 16:32.875
I see! Those women are the amplifiers
for communicating.

16:33.333 --> 16:35.750
Then, the Houtua's are...

16:36.083 --> 16:37.416
It's the name of this race.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.666
Why did you burn the Houtua's yard
with a rain of fire?

16:42.666 --> 16:44.625
Are the Passing Crows wings of death?

16:46.125 --> 16:48.166
Rain of fire?

16:52.625 --> 16:54.958
We had to do that in order to land!

16:55.041 --> 16:58.208
Then why did you bare your fangs
at the Baby Chicks?

16:59.291 --> 17:01.583
Are the Passing Crows wings of death?

17:02.625 --> 17:06.208
We apologize for the misunderstanding.
But we want you to know.

17:07.041 --> 17:09.958
We came here to destroy Godzilla!

17:10.833 --> 17:11.666
Godzilla?

17:15.166 --> 17:16.000
Godzilla?

17:16.458 --> 17:18.250
Destruction. Fear.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.541
The enemy of our God.

17:22.458 --> 17:27.333
The Passing Crows oppose Godzilla,
and pecked at his servant's meat.

17:27.583 --> 17:31.958
That's right! We came here
to take back Earth from Godzilla.

17:32.291 --> 17:35.458
Fight against? A God? Challenge? Godzilla?

17:39.166 --> 17:41.583
The Passing Crows are not wings of death.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.625
They sing songs of life with the Houtua.

17:45.666 --> 17:48.541
However, those claws
will not reach Godzilla.

17:50.291 --> 17:52.250
You're saying we can't win?

17:52.750 --> 17:57.000
The Houtua's God was defeated by Godzilla,
and only left behind an Egg.

17:57.916 --> 18:00.000
Those who challenge, those who oppose,

18:00.500 --> 18:02.708
all become engulfed in flames
and disappear.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.250
That's not true!

18:05.166 --> 18:06.583
We can win!

18:08.083 --> 18:11.375
The Passing Crows may meet the end
of their journey as they desire.

18:12.458 --> 18:16.375
Still, the Houtua will walk a path
of harmony and life.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.458
Harmony...

18:27.541 --> 18:28.541
Behold!

18:28.833 --> 18:32.458
Their lifestyles seem primitive,
but their cultural levels are quite high.

18:33.166 --> 18:35.875
The tied ropes that are strewn about,
those are letters!

18:35.958 --> 18:37.333
They have peculiar patterns.

18:37.666 --> 18:38.666
Really?

18:39.625 --> 18:41.291
Even primitives will have letters.

18:41.750 --> 18:44.583
No, they're a highly developed race.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.541
Oh that's right, Captain Sakaki.

18:47.666 --> 18:50.166
It's about that first Godzilla
we defeated.

18:51.125 --> 18:54.416
As the Houtua say,
apparently that was a subspecies.

18:54.750 --> 18:55.583
Subspecies?

18:55.916 --> 18:59.250
You mean they're the same race
as the flying ones we encountered?

18:59.583 --> 19:00.583
That's not all.

19:00.875 --> 19:04.291
Even the plants and insects,
and life forms in the forest

19:04.375 --> 19:07.375
are showing similar characteristics
with Godzilla.

19:07.708 --> 19:08.916
What does this mean?

19:09.083 --> 19:13.416
It's a strategy to copy a powerful
creature's phenotypic trait to survive.

19:13.791 --> 19:18.500
So it's just mimicry, but beyond that,
and wants to become homogenous.

19:18.750 --> 19:22.625
Perhaps the surface creatures
have entirely submitted to Godzilla.

19:25.708 --> 19:28.458
I won't accept such a thing.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.625
Captain Sakaki, what you said earlier...

19:34.875 --> 19:35.875
were you serious?

19:37.333 --> 19:39.250
That you'll fight it once again?

19:41.666 --> 19:42.541
I am serious.

19:42.625 --> 19:47.166
You! Whose fault do you think it is
that we're in this mess?

19:47.333 --> 19:48.166
Hey--

19:48.416 --> 19:52.208
If you hadn't led us to battle
and brought us to a place like this!

19:52.458 --> 19:54.125
-Hey, how could you--
-Wait.

19:55.250 --> 19:59.125
We defeated the first Godzilla
with Haruo's plan.

19:59.916 --> 20:03.750
As someone who knows defeat from
20 years ago, I almost want to thank him.

20:05.833 --> 20:07.416
Thank you, Belu-be.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.041
I was doubtful, too.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.833
But if we withdraw here,
then why did we get this far?

20:16.291 --> 20:17.333
That's...

20:18.291 --> 20:22.708
But Captain, I honestly don't know
if we can win against that...

20:23.375 --> 20:25.208
the scale's way too off.

20:25.541 --> 20:28.708
If size is the only problem,
then there are a lot of possibilities.

20:29.208 --> 20:30.916
Haruo's strategy was correct.

20:31.541 --> 20:35.291
No matter how big that bastard is,
we'll gather supplies, recreate the stage,

20:35.666 --> 20:37.458
and defeat it in the same way.

20:39.083 --> 20:43.291
This is our last chance
to take back Earth for humanity.

20:59.833 --> 21:02.083
Am I really correct?

21:04.875 --> 21:05.708
Metphies...

21:08.541 --> 21:11.833
Thirty hours have passed since
we lost contact with the landing team.

21:12.125 --> 21:14.250
We still cannot confirm any survivors.

21:15.541 --> 21:17.750
I hope this doesn't come
to a harsh decision.

21:18.500 --> 21:21.416
I'm periodically detecting
a unique signal on the surface.

21:22.041 --> 21:23.791
Looks like it's repeating its patrol.

21:24.458 --> 21:27.958
It's claiming Earth as its own, huh?
Damn that Godzilla!

21:30.875 --> 21:33.000
It's foggy as usual.

21:33.666 --> 21:37.541
The suit's communication device can't
be used to contact the mother ship, right?

21:38.166 --> 21:39.833
We'll look for the landing ship.

21:41.083 --> 21:43.583
Thank you.
We'll be fine on our own from here on.

21:44.291 --> 21:47.041
Haruo, they won't understand our words.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.833
They should understand
that we're here to defeat Godzilla.

21:50.916 --> 21:51.750
That's...

21:52.333 --> 21:57.125
To the village elder who let us go outside
and returned our weapons, we thank him.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.208
Let's go, Haruo.

21:59.375 --> 22:00.208
Yeah, lets go. Let's go.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.833
We, together.

22:06.375 --> 22:08.875
Are you memorizing the words we're saying?

22:09.250 --> 22:12.375
Such high intelligence!
It might be more than I anticipated.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.166
But why come with us?

22:15.250 --> 22:16.458
Probably to monitor us.

22:18.750 --> 22:20.666
Understood. Please come with us.

22:25.958 --> 22:29.041
The landing ship's crash site
should be around here.

22:29.708 --> 22:31.208
For now, though.

22:32.458 --> 22:36.958
It's no good. The compass and
positioning system aren't being useful.

22:37.500 --> 22:41.916
Even if we find the landing ship,
who knows if the mother ship is in orbit.

22:42.833 --> 22:44.041
Let's just look for it.

22:47.333 --> 22:48.291
Is this amusing?

22:48.666 --> 22:53.208
Let's see. It's inconvenient
if we're not using names.

22:54.916 --> 22:55.750
mAina.

22:56.083 --> 22:56.916
mIana.

22:59.083 --> 23:00.458
Are those your names?

23:00.750 --> 23:02.416
But we can't tell the difference.

23:03.041 --> 23:08.708
I think the one who saved me was mIana,
and the one you encountered was mAina.

23:08.791 --> 23:09.791
How can you tell?

23:10.375 --> 23:12.375
The one who glares a lot is mAina.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.750
Earthlings' reasons
are always so emotional.

23:16.166 --> 23:20.041
Besides, I was with mIana
the whole time yesterday.

23:20.791 --> 23:22.583
Ha. Ru. Oi.

23:25.833 --> 23:29.791
That's right. My name is Haruo.

23:31.541 --> 23:33.750
They've taken a liking to you, Haruo.

23:34.416 --> 23:37.458
But their language abilities
are quite high.

23:39.041 --> 23:40.166
What's with them?

23:44.875 --> 23:45.708
This signal...

23:46.625 --> 23:47.666
maybe I found it.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.375
What is this place?

24:08.208 --> 24:09.041
Yuko! Yuko!

24:23.458 --> 24:24.583
These things are pesky!

24:24.958 --> 24:26.166
Damn it! Keep firing!

24:30.958 --> 24:31.791
That is...

24:49.416 --> 24:50.833
I'm sorry.

24:51.666 --> 24:52.875
I'm glad we made it.

24:54.666 --> 24:56.666
Hey, can you show me those arrows?

25:01.041 --> 25:02.583
No! Poison.

25:03.000 --> 25:03.833
Poison?

25:11.916 --> 25:13.666
Battle formation! Fire!

25:19.375 --> 25:20.375
That's...

25:25.125 --> 25:25.958
Did we do it?

25:26.458 --> 25:28.000
Which team survived?

25:36.500 --> 25:37.375
Metphies.

25:41.708 --> 25:42.541
Captain Mori.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.041
It's been about 48 hours.

25:45.625 --> 25:46.458
Yes.

25:47.541 --> 25:50.291
I hereby terminate the search
for the landing team...

25:50.375 --> 25:53.000
and will once again
leave this solar system.

25:54.833 --> 25:56.666
Please wait, Captain Mori.

25:57.958 --> 26:00.250
Garbetrium has given me an oracle.

26:00.916 --> 26:02.916
Disrupting the wicked cloud,

26:03.291 --> 26:07.041
from the bowels of Heaven and Earth,
thou shall once again exchange voices.

26:07.541 --> 26:08.375
A prediction?

26:08.708 --> 26:14.666
You mean the nonsense that your fickle god
occasionally sends on that gadget?

26:15.083 --> 26:18.750
Even if it's nonsense,
has it ever been wrong?

26:19.541 --> 26:22.791
You Bilusaludo's observation
of the Exif's precognition

26:23.125 --> 26:25.583
is from proper application
of Gematron calculation.

26:25.875 --> 26:29.458
Before even bringing up gods,
it was a scientific analysis.

26:30.833 --> 26:34.000
So this "from the bowels of Heaven
and Earth, exchanging voices,"

26:34.083 --> 26:36.541
does that mean
we'll hear from the landing team?

26:36.833 --> 26:38.083
Surface signal captured.

26:39.958 --> 26:41.333
It's a distress signal!

26:41.416 --> 26:42.250
<i>This is Metphies.</i>

26:43.000 --> 26:46.750
<i>Currently, we're gathering troops</i>
<i>near the area of our emergency landing.</i>

26:47.250 --> 26:48.250
<i>Requesting aid.</i> <i>I repeat.</i>

26:49.708 --> 26:53.208
<i>Currently, we're gathering troops</i>
<i>near the area of our emergency landing.</i>

26:53.833 --> 26:54.750
<i>Requesting aid.</i>

27:00.708 --> 27:03.208
We'll welcome anyone who returns
as heroes.

27:07.333 --> 27:11.416
-Can communications open again?
-The noise removal circuits went down.

27:12.541 --> 27:13.666
Please keep trying.

27:14.250 --> 27:15.083
Haruo.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.250
The Central Committee
intends to leave the solar system.

27:19.083 --> 27:20.458
What do you want to do?

27:22.333 --> 27:24.250
Haruo. Got a moment?

27:25.083 --> 27:27.250
Belu-be, Galu-gu. Where've you been?

27:27.666 --> 27:31.833
We were confirming
whether or not what we saw was true.

27:32.125 --> 27:33.125
What do you mean?

27:33.500 --> 27:35.250
Haruo. We can win.

27:35.541 --> 27:36.541
What did you say?

27:38.208 --> 27:40.000
What? You're not coming back?

27:40.291 --> 27:43.416
Hang on a second, then why did we...

27:43.666 --> 27:45.333
This isn't everyone's volition.

27:45.583 --> 27:48.166
That's what I wanted to know
and gathered everyone.

27:49.791 --> 27:51.458
Everyone, I'm sorry.

27:52.416 --> 27:55.458
I drafted
the Godzilla Search and Destroy Plan,

27:55.541 --> 27:59.625
insisted on the deployment of the
landing team, and brought everyone here.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.791
I inherited the commanding position
from Leland,

28:02.875 --> 28:05.375
and as a result, we lost many comrades.

28:05.750 --> 28:08.375
Regarding that,
I can never apologize enough.

28:09.666 --> 28:12.166
I've come to believe
that the plan was successful.

28:12.708 --> 28:16.791
But as you know, we encountered a monster
far greater than our expectations,

28:16.875 --> 28:19.000
and were defeated before even a fight.

28:19.083 --> 28:20.250
We can't win against it.

28:20.750 --> 28:22.500
There are people who thought that.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.041
Honestly, I was one of them.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.875
However, is that really true?

28:28.833 --> 28:32.291
Is it really immortal?
I believe that it isn't.

28:33.291 --> 28:36.458
Humanity's history has been
a chain of challenges against chaos.

28:36.833 --> 28:39.583
And every time,
humans always used knowledge as a weapon.

28:40.250 --> 28:42.583
We have defeated its kin.

28:43.333 --> 28:45.583
To humanity, this is one victory.

28:46.250 --> 28:49.583
Theoretically, it was proven
that Godzilla can be killed.

28:49.791 --> 28:53.333
However,
currently we lack supplies and soldiers.

28:53.583 --> 28:55.458
In this condition, isn't it impossible?

28:55.875 --> 28:56.708
Galu-gu, Belu-be.

28:57.791 --> 29:01.250
We've acquired the most powerful material.
It's nanometal.

29:01.541 --> 29:02.375
Nanometal?

29:02.916 --> 29:06.750
Autonomous metal. If I recall,
it was material used for Mechagodzilla.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.958
Mechagodzilla was attacked
right before activation,

29:10.083 --> 29:12.125
and was destroyed with the laboratory.

29:12.208 --> 29:16.250
The development data was also lost,
and you said that it can't be recreated.

29:16.333 --> 29:18.041
However, it had survived.

29:18.458 --> 29:20.250
And in a more evolved state.

29:20.708 --> 29:22.041
That's what this is.

29:23.083 --> 29:26.291
It's the Houtua's arrowhead, right?
Is that nanometal?

29:26.625 --> 29:27.458
Yes.

29:28.166 --> 29:30.875
<i>The exterior had changed,</i>
<i>but the arrowheads and knives</i>

29:30.958 --> 29:34.625
<i>that the native people were using</i>
<i>was definitely nanometal.</i>

29:35.583 --> 29:40.291
<i>An artisan made weapons utilizing</i>
<i>this special metal characteristic.</i>

29:40.833 --> 29:43.666
<i>Originally,</i>
<i>for nanometal to self-regenerate,</i>

29:43.750 --> 29:46.458
<i>it fused on a molecular level</i>
<i>with its surroundings</i>

29:46.541 --> 29:48.083
<i>and had an ability to duplicate.</i>

29:48.875 --> 29:50.875
<i>This proliferation speed is abnormal,</i>

29:50.958 --> 29:53.458
<i>but since its been left alone for a while,</i>

29:54.000 --> 29:56.458
<i>it may have resulted</i>
<i>in the limiter malfunctioning.</i>

29:56.875 --> 30:00.083
There were more, bigger clumps of it
in the weapons workshop.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.333
They're harvesting it from somewhere.

30:02.416 --> 30:05.000
Mechagodzilla's laboratory
that was at Mt. Fuji's base

30:05.083 --> 30:07.125
isn't too far from this Old Tanzawa Pass.

30:07.541 --> 30:10.166
I see.
The carcass must be in the underground.

30:10.458 --> 30:11.291
That's right.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.791
If we can find the harvesting location,
and collect a good amount of nanometal,

30:18.541 --> 30:19.916
we can defeat Godzilla.

30:20.333 --> 30:21.166
We can?

30:21.791 --> 30:27.125
Um, still, it's not too late to return to
the mother ship and discuss things there.

30:27.416 --> 30:32.041
The Central Committee will likely abandon
Earth, and continue the wandering journey.

30:32.541 --> 30:36.375
If we return,
they will forcibly withdraw from Earth.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.083
To go back
to a cruel and humiliating ship life,

30:41.708 --> 30:45.041
or remain here and continue the fight
to take back Earth.

30:46.458 --> 30:49.916
I won't force this on anyone.
I'll respect those who want to return.

30:50.458 --> 30:52.291
Everyone, please decide on your own.

30:52.666 --> 30:54.166
Can we really win?

30:54.250 --> 30:58.000
-With his strategy, we defeated one.
-But it'll be a military crime.

30:58.333 --> 31:00.166
Well? What will you do?

31:00.916 --> 31:02.708
-I will stay.
-Me too.

31:02.791 --> 31:04.625
-I will remain.
-Please, let me stay.

31:06.166 --> 31:07.833
It's obvious for Bilusaludians.

31:08.333 --> 31:10.541
Instead of retreating immediately,

31:11.125 --> 31:14.750
we should recover the carcass
of Mechagodzilla and examine it.

31:15.083 --> 31:17.333
Whether we fight Godzilla again or not

31:17.541 --> 31:21.708
can be decided after we determine the
effectiveness of the alternated nanometal.

31:22.208 --> 31:25.791
If we give up here, the people who
gave their lives can't rest peacefully.

31:27.541 --> 31:29.083
I'll stay.

31:29.416 --> 31:35.708
Yeah. If we run, we could be saved, but to
live the rest of your life regretting...

31:36.500 --> 31:37.791
-I'll remain.
-Me too!

31:38.166 --> 31:39.875
-I'll stay, too.
-So will I.

31:40.791 --> 31:42.833
-I'm staying!
-Please.

31:42.916 --> 31:43.750
Everyone...

31:44.250 --> 31:46.208
-I want to stay!
-Me too!

31:53.166 --> 31:55.416
Professor, you didn't want to go back?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.875
This place is a treasure house
full of research material.

31:59.208 --> 32:00.041
Haruo.

32:00.625 --> 32:02.250
Let's ask where the nanometal is.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.333
Yeah.

32:05.708 --> 32:07.625
Are they really going to guide us there?

32:07.708 --> 32:09.083
Let's believe in them.

32:21.041 --> 32:21.916
Beautiful...

32:23.666 --> 32:25.250
A habitat for glowing moss, huh?

32:27.083 --> 32:28.041
Captain Sakaki.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.458
-What is it?
-It's about the Houtua.

32:31.625 --> 32:33.458
The powder that's on their skin...

32:34.041 --> 32:35.083
I researched it.

32:35.958 --> 32:38.750
A part of the Houtua's genetics
are most likely insects.

32:39.333 --> 32:40.958
And one that is a sudden variant.

32:42.541 --> 32:47.625
If they did inherit humanity's genetics,
that kind of evolution won't happen.

32:48.416 --> 32:50.708
Because the creatures
turned into a Godzilla,

32:51.375 --> 32:54.541
they must be carrying
some kind of monster factor.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.333
Monster...

33:20.708 --> 33:24.333
Corporal Marco Ghione and two others,
w-we have returned!

33:24.666 --> 33:25.541
That's it?

33:26.000 --> 33:27.250
Where are the others?

33:30.666 --> 33:32.916
What's going on? Answer me!

33:33.291 --> 33:35.083
Captain Sakaki again, huh?

33:36.791 --> 33:38.208
Monster factor...

33:38.625 --> 33:43.000
Well, before that,
our problem is the surface's ecosystem.

33:43.500 --> 33:44.333
Is that so?

33:44.750 --> 33:49.791
Gradually, this ecosystem
has been made to serve one individual.

33:50.125 --> 33:52.916
All the organisms serve one?

33:53.291 --> 33:54.125
It's Godzilla.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.208
Earth's current ecosystem
is structured to serve under Godzilla.

34:00.833 --> 34:05.833
As the lord of creation, I can surmise
that Earth chose not humans, but it.

34:06.875 --> 34:08.958
Earth chose Godzilla?

34:09.708 --> 34:13.041
<i>Pollution and global warming</i>
<i>due to carbon dioxide,</i>

34:13.333 --> 34:16.791
<i>and the multiple nuclear tests</i>
<i>conducted because of the armaments race.</i>

34:17.333 --> 34:19.416
<i>Such repeated environmental damage</i>

34:19.666 --> 34:22.708
<i>brought the arrival of monsters.</i>
<i>That's the accepted theory.</i>

34:23.500 --> 34:27.291
If civilization disappeared, the natural
environment would slowly be restored

34:27.375 --> 34:30.083
and return to its original state,
or so we thought.

34:30.958 --> 34:33.458
However,
reality has given us the opposite.

34:34.208 --> 34:38.166
The Earth has changed so much
that it can’t be undone.

34:38.958 --> 34:40.750
So we need to defeat Godzilla.

34:41.750 --> 34:44.125
It's humanity's responsibility to do so.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.208
Th-This is...

34:48.458 --> 34:49.666
There's no mistake.

34:50.125 --> 34:50.958
What is it?

34:51.041 --> 34:53.916
Haruo, I picked up a unique signal ahead.

34:55.125 --> 34:58.416
The only one that can transmit
a signal like this is Mechagodzilla!

34:58.625 --> 34:59.500
Then...

34:59.583 --> 35:00.708
It's alive!

35:01.083 --> 35:02.666
Our Mechagodzilla!

35:07.166 --> 35:08.500
It looks like an exit.

35:19.625 --> 35:21.625
It's them again! Shoot them down!

35:24.750 --> 35:25.750
Yuko! Did you see that?

35:49.000 --> 35:51.750
Yes. That it has evolved this far...

35:54.083 --> 35:55.750
<i>This way! Over here!</i>

36:03.916 --> 36:04.750
No way.

36:08.125 --> 36:11.250
I-Is this a city?

36:11.833 --> 36:14.041
Why would such a...

36:20.125 --> 36:24.833
I-It's all nanometal. But how?

36:25.375 --> 36:27.625
How did it get to such a large amount?

36:28.166 --> 36:31.125
It took 20,000 years and kept growing.

36:31.958 --> 36:33.708
From Mechagodzilla's carcass.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.166
Yes, this is...

36:38.333 --> 36:39.708
Mechagodzilla City!

36:42.541 --> 36:44.208
Mechagodzilla, huh?

36:45.083 --> 36:47.250
But how can...

36:49.625 --> 36:52.375
The signal source is up ahead.

36:53.625 --> 36:57.875
On this planet that Godzilla rules,
and even after losing its master,

36:57.958 --> 37:01.666
our Mechagodzilla
had been continuing to fight.

37:08.166 --> 37:09.208
Let's go, Haruo.

37:09.291 --> 37:10.125
Yeah.

37:15.666 --> 37:18.875
It's the Houtua.
They noticed the twins weren't around.

37:21.958 --> 37:24.541
Thanks for bringing us here.
Please, return.

37:25.666 --> 37:29.541
That, sinister thing. Poison.

37:31.875 --> 37:32.708
I see.

37:40.250 --> 37:41.375
What did they say?

37:42.500 --> 37:44.250
They said it's poison. Poison, huh?

37:57.208 --> 37:59.416
This one
has turned into nanometal as well.

37:59.500 --> 38:03.291
Perhaps the material for the
town-like structures are being provided

38:03.375 --> 38:06.458
by the metallic chemical element
that it consumed.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.541
It's probably all connected underground.

38:10.291 --> 38:14.041
For 20,000 years
it continued to consume...

38:14.666 --> 38:17.375
We won't be consumed too, would we?

38:17.666 --> 38:18.500
Don't worry.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.750
It's only obeying the order
of "defeat Godzilla."

38:26.291 --> 38:29.125
There's gas being emitted
from the nanometal's exterior.

38:29.583 --> 38:31.708
This is creating the clouds above,

38:31.791 --> 38:35.416
becoming a type of heated, active
camouflage and concealing this area.

38:36.125 --> 38:39.125
No wonder we couldn't find this place.

38:46.333 --> 38:48.125
Isn't it astounding?

38:49.166 --> 38:50.708
This facility...

38:51.708 --> 38:54.541
I see,
it's Mechagodzilla's development plant.

38:54.916 --> 38:57.541
That's correct. It's a reproduction of it.

38:57.875 --> 39:01.750
A reproduction? But such a scale...

39:02.000 --> 39:04.625
It self-multiplied
by several 100 times its size.

39:04.791 --> 39:07.083
As I thought, the commands still work.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.041
You can retract your helmets.

39:11.125 --> 39:12.833
The environmental maintenance
command is still alive.

39:13.208 --> 39:16.041
The air around the City
is adapted for our needs.

39:16.875 --> 39:19.833
These sure are strange looking structures.

39:20.250 --> 39:21.458
It's Mechagodzilla.

39:22.500 --> 39:26.041
Some of the parts are constructed
by Mechagodzilla.

39:26.958 --> 39:29.666
This is an evolution
beyond our imagination.

39:32.250 --> 39:34.833
If we can convert all this material
into parts,

39:35.041 --> 39:37.583
wouldn't it be possible
to build Mechagodzilla again?

39:38.041 --> 39:41.583
Not only that,
but construct more ambitious plans!

39:42.166 --> 39:43.250
Just as I thought.

39:43.666 --> 39:45.875
The signal source is inside this building. Can we still use
the original command codes?

39:48.458 --> 39:49.458
Most likely, yes.

40:04.541 --> 40:05.833
Are we going inside?

40:05.916 --> 40:08.666
Either way, we have to search this place.

40:10.041 --> 40:10.875
Let's go.

40:12.666 --> 40:16.166
It feels like
I'm about to go inside a monster.

40:23.083 --> 40:23.916
It's here.

40:24.625 --> 40:26.166
This is the signal source.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.166
<i>Haruo? What's wrong?</i>

40:38.666 --> 40:40.291
Wait, is this...

40:41.708 --> 40:44.250
I thought you said
nanometal won't attack humans!

40:44.500 --> 40:45.833
While it's alive, it won't.

40:46.416 --> 40:49.666
These corpses got absorbed
because they couldn't get away in time.

40:50.416 --> 40:52.375
Will this really be okay?

40:57.958 --> 40:58.791
Here it is. This is...

41:13.375 --> 41:14.500
the signal source?

41:20.958 --> 41:23.500
The exterior is covered
with nanometal, huh?

41:28.291 --> 41:30.166
The carcass of Mechagodzilla.

41:30.875 --> 41:33.583
No, this isn't an ordinary carcass. The signal was indeed
coming from the head.

41:37.333 --> 41:40.958
Half of the artificial
intelligence unit's block is alive.

41:41.333 --> 41:42.583
Control is possible!

42:09.458 --> 42:11.250
Yes! We can do this!

42:12.083 --> 42:12.916
This is...

42:13.708 --> 42:16.333
We've accessed Mechagodzilla's
artificial intelligence

42:16.583 --> 42:19.000
and are now reproducing the control unit.

42:19.291 --> 42:21.458
The body may have been destroyed
by Godzilla,

42:21.666 --> 42:24.666
but the head that was tossed aside
kept on fighting.

42:25.375 --> 42:27.375
Then, using this base as the center,

42:27.666 --> 42:33.541
it continued to grow via the nanometal
over 20,000 years, and built this City.

42:37.500 --> 42:38.875
-Amazing.
-Yeah.

42:42.041 --> 42:44.625
Why does it look like
this area has been gouged out?

42:44.875 --> 42:47.291
It's the hole Godzilla opened
with its heat ray.

42:48.041 --> 42:53.083
At that time, 200 meters away,
it burned down this development facility,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.500
along with 730 of my comrades.

42:58.291 --> 42:59.666
Such destructive power. That's still nothing.

43:02.625 --> 43:05.041
It's estimated to be
six times its original size.

43:05.125 --> 43:07.208
Using that as a basis for output,

43:07.500 --> 43:11.000
if each cell generated electricity
at the previous amount,

43:11.083 --> 43:13.333
-the heat ray's power is--
-Stop it, Metphies.

43:14.875 --> 43:16.875
Oh, my apologies.

43:17.583 --> 43:21.916
I wanted to say that if we rebuild
an anti-Godzilla weapon from the past,

43:22.416 --> 43:25.000
it probably won't work
for the current one.

43:25.291 --> 43:26.875
Anti-Godzilla weapon?

43:27.708 --> 43:30.958
Such a limited strategy
is now unnecessary.

43:31.291 --> 43:34.000
If we mobilize
all the proliferated nanometal,

43:34.208 --> 43:37.500
we can deploy an overwhelming
material warfare strategy.

43:39.583 --> 43:42.125
Okay, first we need
to secure communication.

43:44.250 --> 43:47.083
Haruo, communication
to the base camp has been restored.

43:47.291 --> 43:49.750
We should also be able
to contact the mother ship.

43:50.250 --> 43:52.625
Okay, first they'll leave
the Houtua village.

43:53.458 --> 43:57.291
From here,
we can cluster control the entire City.

43:57.583 --> 44:01.833
We'll fortify city structure,
and construct an enormous trap.

44:02.708 --> 44:07.583
I'll turn this entire city
into Godzilla's execution device. If we had all this,
then even if it's Godzilla...

44:22.791 --> 44:26.291
<i>Wait, Captain Sakaki.</i>
<i>Do you still intend to fight Godzilla?</i>

44:26.666 --> 44:27.875
This time we'll win!

44:28.458 --> 44:31.500
We weren't wrong the other day.
It's just a problem of scale.

44:31.875 --> 44:34.958
And we have enough materials here
to cover that.

44:36.458 --> 44:38.083
<i>-However--</i>
-If eliminating Godzilla

44:38.166 --> 44:41.333
would go against
the Central Committee's policy regardless,

44:41.666 --> 44:44.875
I am ready to accept
any punishment handed down to me.

44:45.125 --> 44:46.375
<i>But, Captain Sakaki--</i>

44:49.791 --> 44:51.708
Captain. The data from the mother ship

44:51.791 --> 44:54.791
appears to be Godzilla's recording
of special movement waves.

44:55.416 --> 44:57.125
The time it doesn't move is long.

44:57.541 --> 45:01.291
Sometimes, it'll wake up
as if remembering, and patrol the area.

45:01.791 --> 45:06.708
It might be wandering this area
because it's looking for this place.

45:07.625 --> 45:11.208
Godzilla appeared right after
we defeated the first one.

45:12.083 --> 45:16.500
It's mildly suspecting that
something's happened in this area.

45:17.041 --> 45:19.583
Right now,
a camouflaged cloud is hiding us,

45:19.666 --> 45:21.875
but if we activate the city,
won't it find us?

45:21.958 --> 45:24.250
We have to act before it finds us.

45:25.083 --> 45:27.333
Galu-gu,
will fortifications make it in time?

45:27.708 --> 45:28.541
Of course.

45:41.166 --> 45:43.750
The interior's circuits
are being scanned, too.

45:44.250 --> 45:47.333
Skeleton, armor,
and the engine's interior mechanisms

45:47.416 --> 45:51.000
can be customized to the pilot's
characteristics as much as they'd like.

45:51.458 --> 45:53.833
Power storage equal to a fusion reactor.

45:53.916 --> 45:56.833
Amazing,
I'll get three times more momentum.

45:57.500 --> 46:00.083
But the pilot can't endure it,
so there's no point.

46:00.333 --> 46:04.166
If we mechanize everything, we don't have
to think about the body's burden.

46:04.750 --> 46:08.625
Yes, but wouldn't remote controlling
have about a less-than-a-second delay?

46:08.916 --> 46:12.208
It's complete mechanization.
You don't need to worry about that.

46:13.791 --> 46:16.000
Thanks for gathering.
I'll start immediately.

46:16.750 --> 46:18.916
I'd like to confirm the strategy overview.

46:20.041 --> 46:23.083
This strategy is similar
to the previous plan's deployments.

46:23.666 --> 46:26.791
The problem is, where should we
deploy this strategy?

46:27.583 --> 46:29.083
And it will be this City.

46:30.208 --> 46:31.458
We'll lure it here?

46:31.625 --> 46:33.708
We'll do close combat with that monster?

46:34.041 --> 46:38.833
We can concentrate all the energy within
this Mechagodzilla City and overpower it.

46:39.250 --> 46:43.125
When the fortifications are complete,
we'll lift the heated camouflage cloud,

46:43.458 --> 46:46.666
deploy the mobile weapon currently
in production to the outer crater,

46:46.750 --> 46:48.375
and divert it to the trap point.

46:48.458 --> 46:49.416
Mobile weapon?

46:49.708 --> 46:51.416
-Belu-be, if you would.
-Yes.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.166
Currently, we're strengthening
an existing weapon with nanometal.

46:57.291 --> 46:59.625
And this is the completed form.

47:01.500 --> 47:05.916
We'll make overwhelming improvements
to the defense, attack power, mobility,

47:06.125 --> 47:07.833
and add in flying abilities.

47:08.541 --> 47:11.083
We call it the Vulture.

47:11.750 --> 47:14.000
With this Vulture's saturated attacks,

47:14.166 --> 47:16.708
we'll provoke Godzilla,
divert it to the trap point,

47:17.333 --> 47:21.291
and drop it on the detour route
in the underground's nanometal vein,

47:21.500 --> 47:23.541
and swiftly carry it to the capture point.

47:24.083 --> 47:28.750
For the heat ray, we'll use laminated heat
armor plating, spray nanometal particles,

47:28.833 --> 47:32.083
deploy a thermal energy buffer zone,
and somehow hold out.

47:32.625 --> 47:34.208
However, this is a speed battle.

47:34.791 --> 47:39.083
At the capture point, we'll fill it
with liquid nanometal, and stop it.

47:39.625 --> 47:43.208
Using the railguns we set up,
we'll focus fire on one point.

47:43.791 --> 47:47.666
Then, we'll noise sync, and from
both flanks we'll destroy the dorsal fin.

47:48.041 --> 47:49.708
Once the shield collapses...

47:50.291 --> 47:54.208
From behind, we'll finish it
with this EMP harpoon.

47:54.708 --> 47:56.500
It's like a lance for a whale.

47:56.791 --> 48:00.583
From the harpoon's electric pulses,
its electromagnetic waves will run wild...

48:00.666 --> 48:03.125
...overload,
and its body will explode to pieces.

48:03.666 --> 48:06.916
Its grave will be
the very hole it opened itself.

48:07.333 --> 48:08.625
May I say something?

48:09.291 --> 48:13.291
It seems like all of the nanometal
will be handled by the Bilusaludo.

48:13.625 --> 48:16.833
The base for the control script
is written in Bilusaludo language.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.458
To have other races use it
would be inefficient.

48:19.916 --> 48:25.291
Unless you're saying you don't like how
the Bilusaludo are monopolizing nanometal?

48:25.500 --> 48:27.291
No, that's not what I'm saying.

48:27.625 --> 48:30.291
If you were operating it,
you'd be working constantly.

48:30.375 --> 48:34.416
We are not tied down
by physical limitations such as fatigue.

48:34.958 --> 48:36.041
But that's insane.

48:36.541 --> 48:41.833
This City's environment itself supplies
the Bilusaludo with endless energy.

48:42.541 --> 48:43.791
Just leave it to us.

48:49.666 --> 48:51.083
<i>It's completely changed.</i>

48:51.625 --> 48:54.208
Our nanometal is amazing, right?

48:55.750 --> 48:57.583
I actually have a small favor to ask.

48:59.375 --> 49:02.750
In the past, before this place
was destroyed by Godzilla,

49:03.333 --> 49:05.416
there was a lab that analyzed and repaired

49:05.750 --> 49:09.458
our Gematron calculation crystal
with your technology.

49:10.041 --> 49:13.291
Can that be reproduced
with nanometal's abilities?

49:14.000 --> 49:16.583
Oh. What will you do with such a thing?

49:17.166 --> 49:19.125
I wish to repair this Garbetrium.

49:20.291 --> 49:21.708
It's a ritual component.

49:23.125 --> 49:25.041
Oh, so it's just junk?

49:25.625 --> 49:28.750
It's a precious foundation for our hearts.

49:30.583 --> 49:32.916
To the Shining Valley, a song of grief.

49:33.458 --> 49:36.000
A Snake that bites on bones sneaks near.

49:36.750 --> 49:38.833
The Passing Crow flies towards twilight.

49:39.625 --> 49:41.625
To the Burning Mountain, a funeral song.

49:42.583 --> 49:45.125
The darkness of the land
is the Houtua's tranquility.

49:45.625 --> 49:46.875
Give praise to the Egg.

49:48.125 --> 49:50.458
To the Passing Crows, wings of life.

49:51.791 --> 49:53.333
The wings will break.

49:54.541 --> 49:57.833
The Egg proclaims nothing.

50:04.833 --> 50:06.916
This place is creepy.

50:07.750 --> 50:10.125
What do you think about this strategy?

50:10.583 --> 50:13.875
What do I think? Well, you know...

50:17.041 --> 50:17.875
What's wrong?

50:18.833 --> 50:21.750
We all feel uneasy about this strategy.

50:22.333 --> 50:25.708
Should we believe in the Bilusaludo
and nanometal?

50:26.250 --> 50:27.375
How ridiculous.

50:28.166 --> 50:30.875
Those who are lost possess intelligence.

50:31.666 --> 50:36.583
However, if you remain lost and arrive
at God's Gate, you shall not pass through.

50:37.500 --> 50:38.333
What?

50:38.708 --> 50:43.083
Another preaching just for ease of mind?
Please stop it.

50:43.541 --> 50:45.791
Right now is not the time for god.

50:46.250 --> 50:48.166
Don't lose sight of the main goal.

50:48.916 --> 50:55.541
Right now, what's important is to gather
all intelligence to defeat the evil being.

51:14.666 --> 51:16.208
It's more than I imagined.

51:16.541 --> 51:21.166
If she stays near the City, she'll be
supplied with nanometal's endless energy.

51:22.166 --> 51:25.166
Within five kilometers
of the crater's rim, she's invincible.

51:26.000 --> 51:26.833
Amazing.

51:27.958 --> 51:29.583
I can't believe I can freely...

51:30.833 --> 51:33.666
this is the Vulture. Bilusaludo's power!

51:36.791 --> 51:38.208
I think that's enough, Yuko.

51:38.625 --> 51:40.583
Master Sergeant Tani is doing well.

51:41.250 --> 51:44.083
The compatibility between her
and the Vulture is amazing.

51:44.625 --> 51:46.125
They're a competent unit.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.250
How's the situation?

51:55.458 --> 51:56.416
It's going well.

51:56.791 --> 51:59.958
Looks like problems during the test flight
can be easily fixed.

52:00.291 --> 52:01.958
I see. That's good then.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.250
But you should sleep.

52:05.583 --> 52:09.083
It's like we returned
to the spaceship, isn't it?

52:10.375 --> 52:14.083
We're surrounded by machines,
so it's somewhat nostalgic for us,

52:14.458 --> 52:16.250
yet somewhat different.

52:16.916 --> 52:18.625
Yeah. That's true.

52:21.375 --> 52:23.791
So what do you think about this strategy?

52:24.208 --> 52:25.583
I'm sure it'll succeed.

52:25.708 --> 52:27.125
That's not what I meant.

52:27.583 --> 52:31.041
Is it okay for everyone
to get dragged in like this?

52:31.708 --> 52:32.708
Well, that's...

52:33.416 --> 52:36.625
I think I'm obsessed with Godzilla
because of personal grudges.

52:40.333 --> 52:43.416
Haruo, you were my hope.

52:43.666 --> 52:44.500
What?

52:44.875 --> 52:47.166
We don't have any memories of Earth.

52:47.750 --> 52:50.958
And honestly, we never understood
the older people's homesickness.

52:51.791 --> 52:56.291
The memories of Earth that Grandpa
spoke about were almost like a fairy tale.

52:56.708 --> 52:58.125
It didn't feel real.

52:58.708 --> 53:00.166
Grandpa, huh?

53:06.291 --> 53:09.083
I'm sorry. Because of Grandpa, you...

53:09.666 --> 53:11.625
That's okay. It's not your fault.

53:12.541 --> 53:16.916
But because of that incident,
we all received hope.

53:17.291 --> 53:18.125
What?

53:18.833 --> 53:22.541
To give up everything,
and live life not feeling anything.

53:23.208 --> 53:25.375
In space, I thought that was normal.

53:26.625 --> 53:28.166
But you were different.

53:28.875 --> 53:31.208
You can be mad at the things
you can't forgive.

53:31.291 --> 53:33.250
I feel like that's what you taught me.

53:34.958 --> 53:39.666
And so, wherever you go,
I will follow you.

53:40.916 --> 53:42.250
That's what I decided.

53:42.916 --> 53:43.750
Yuko.

53:47.750 --> 53:48.583
Haruo?

53:49.375 --> 53:52.125
It's nothing. My wounds haven't healed.

53:52.791 --> 53:55.291
Ever since I came here,
it hurts sometimes.

54:17.416 --> 54:18.416
Captain Sakaki.

54:19.666 --> 54:22.625
I'm actually concerned about something.

54:23.333 --> 54:27.833
Ever since we got here, a lot of soldiers
are reporting poor physical health.

54:28.208 --> 54:30.958
I'm also
filling in the doctor's role, too.

54:32.500 --> 54:36.708
Many of them were members who were treated
at the Houtua's settlement.

54:37.333 --> 54:38.208
What?

54:38.291 --> 54:42.916
Didn't they smear their secretions
of powder-like substance on you too?

54:44.000 --> 54:45.208
Yes, probably.

54:45.833 --> 54:49.416
Maybe that doesn't have
a good affinity with this nanometal.

54:50.166 --> 54:53.875
When I took them outside
the City's buildings, they were healed.

54:54.583 --> 54:55.583
I see.

54:56.458 --> 54:58.791
Are you all right?

55:00.083 --> 55:02.291
I'm fine.

55:08.875 --> 55:11.541
<i>Everything is destiny.</i>

55:13.250 --> 55:19.083
Tens of thousands of years ago, our
mother planet was destroyed by monsters

55:20.291 --> 55:22.500
and we became wanderers of space.

55:24.375 --> 55:27.958
And there, we discerned our mission.

55:29.458 --> 55:34.833
In other words, we are to guide other
species who share our same challenges.

55:35.791 --> 55:36.916
A missionary road.

55:43.666 --> 55:44.500
Metphies.

55:45.708 --> 55:46.666
Well, this is...

55:47.875 --> 55:50.375
Did you come to join the gathering, Haruo?

55:51.458 --> 55:53.208
No, just a change of pace.

55:54.208 --> 55:55.875
It doesn't look like that, though.

55:58.791 --> 55:59.791
I'm lost.

56:01.958 --> 56:02.791
Come in.

56:06.708 --> 56:11.000
I asked Galu-gu, and had them make this
into my personal workshop.

56:11.875 --> 56:12.875
What are you doing?

56:14.208 --> 56:16.041
It's just a broken sacred item.

56:16.750 --> 56:19.041
I was repairing it
with Bilusaludo technology.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.458
The Exif's cultural inheritance, huh?

56:24.375 --> 56:26.625
You said you were lost, right, Haruo?

56:27.625 --> 56:31.166
Is it okay that I'm the commanding officer
for this strategy?

56:31.416 --> 56:32.958
Everyone chose you, Haruo.

56:33.625 --> 56:36.958
This is the Bilusaludo's fort,
and our last hope.

56:37.833 --> 56:42.625
But I can't help but feel
that nanometal is something dreadful.

56:45.250 --> 56:48.458
This is a sinister thing.

56:52.333 --> 56:54.625
A sinister thing, huh?

56:56.250 --> 57:00.083
In essence, it's a wicked thing.
It's no different from a monster.

57:00.833 --> 57:04.250
And to the Bilusaludo who worship it,
I have apprehensions.

57:04.708 --> 57:07.125
Their thought process is too robotic.

57:07.958 --> 57:10.750
But can you really call that intelligence?

57:11.500 --> 57:13.250
Isn't it just logical?

57:14.083 --> 57:17.583
Those with intelligence
will become lost, angry, and grieve. Our battle must be something beyond that.

57:23.791 --> 57:27.875
But the Bilusaludo belittle the souls
who believe that.

57:28.833 --> 57:32.375
They are not trying to unify
the galaxy's intelligence.

57:33.291 --> 57:36.291
But instead, it's as if they want
to become one with monsters.

57:36.833 --> 57:38.666
One with monsters?

57:39.375 --> 57:41.000
I've told you before

57:41.083 --> 57:44.166
that toward the end of many planets'
civilization's development,

57:44.791 --> 57:46.500
they gave birth to monsters.

57:48.333 --> 57:54.083
The Bilusaludos, even now,
may make our same mistake again.

57:56.333 --> 57:57.166
Metphies.

57:57.958 --> 58:00.833
Was your planet
destroyed by monsters, too?

58:01.958 --> 58:02.791
Yes.

58:04.041 --> 58:07.125
To that which brought
the end of our civilization,

58:07.666 --> 58:09.916
we hesitate greatly
to carelessly say its name.

58:11.041 --> 58:14.458
Words just have that much strength.

58:14.833 --> 58:16.500
So it's like a bad omen?

58:17.083 --> 58:17.916
Yes. But Haruo,

58:20.416 --> 58:26.083
to you who is about to face Godzilla,
I should probably tell you.

58:27.208 --> 58:30.833
The destructive name that we Exif
have been secretly hiding.

58:33.041 --> 58:33.875
Why me?

58:34.708 --> 58:38.125
Remember it when you're in battle,
and about to be swallowed in fear.

58:38.500 --> 58:42.541
There is a far greater destructive power
lurking somewhere in space.

58:43.208 --> 58:47.416
Compared to that,
Godzilla would not even be worth the fear.

58:49.000 --> 58:49.833
Hey, hey...

58:59.125 --> 59:01.375
Keep it within the corner
of your memories.

59:02.125 --> 59:05.541
But you must never say it
in the presence of others.

59:13.291 --> 59:14.125
Yuko.

59:16.416 --> 59:18.458
<i>The Shining Valley is the lamenting marsh.</i>

59:18.833 --> 59:20.541
<i>The Snake beckons it into darkness.</i>

59:21.875 --> 59:24.250
<i>The singing should reach</i>
<i>the bottom of the marsh.</i>

59:25.000 --> 59:26.541
<i>The Passing Crow to the skies...</i>

59:29.291 --> 59:30.125
So pretty.

59:30.833 --> 59:31.666
Yeah.

59:33.083 --> 59:37.875
The people of the past watched the town's
night sky as they walked outside, right?

59:38.166 --> 59:39.750
Yeah, probably.

59:40.833 --> 59:43.958
I'm jealous that you know about
the past Earth.

59:44.708 --> 59:47.625
I was just a kid,
so I don't remember much.

59:48.791 --> 59:50.958
Were you listening
to the Exif's teachings?

59:51.416 --> 59:53.375
No, it was a personal discussion.

59:54.041 --> 59:59.333
Major Belu-be said that any intellectual
life relying on religion is immature.

1:00:00.291 --> 1:00:01.791
That's very Bilusaludian.

1:00:02.666 --> 1:00:04.458
Haruo, are you okay?

1:00:05.791 --> 1:00:07.916
You didn't look so well before. Yeah, I'm fine now.

1:00:12.958 --> 1:00:13.791
Yuko...

1:00:14.958 --> 1:00:16.375
I won't be lost anymore.

1:00:18.416 --> 1:00:21.708
What we should be doing now
is defeating Godzilla.

1:00:22.458 --> 1:00:26.000
So Earth can once again
be in the hands of humans.

1:00:27.375 --> 1:00:28.583
I promise you, Yuko.

1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.916
We'll win, and I'll show you
how Earth used to be.

1:00:32.791 --> 1:00:33.625
Haruo.

1:00:50.791 --> 1:00:52.541
With Mechagodzilla City's discovery,

1:00:53.041 --> 1:00:56.958
the Bilusaludos on the ship
are now against withdrawing from Earth.

1:00:57.291 --> 1:01:00.541
They say we should reconvene in the City
and fight with Godzilla.

1:01:00.958 --> 1:01:02.833
As if echoing them, the Exif agree.

1:01:03.208 --> 1:01:05.250
All intelligence shall be joined together,

1:01:05.333 --> 1:01:07.833
and are hardening their claim
for a joint struggle.

1:01:08.625 --> 1:01:11.625
Give yourself
to universal intelligence, huh?

1:01:13.250 --> 1:01:16.791
We must all be as one.

1:01:18.208 --> 1:01:21.000
Until the promised day
God descends upon us.

1:01:23.666 --> 1:01:25.875
It won't go crazy on us, right?

1:01:26.333 --> 1:01:28.625
The fortifications will be done
in a few hours.

1:01:28.958 --> 1:01:31.291
Now isn't the time to worry about that.

1:01:31.666 --> 1:01:38.166
If this Mechagodzilla City beats Godzilla,
is it really a victory for us?

1:01:39.041 --> 1:01:42.708
If it beats Godzilla, will the nanometal
then consume the land?

1:01:43.041 --> 1:01:44.541
Geez, stop thinking--

1:01:46.666 --> 1:01:48.291
What are they doing?

1:02:04.083 --> 1:02:05.458
Okay, I'll see you.

1:02:05.833 --> 1:02:08.583
-What?
-I still have things to do.

1:02:09.250 --> 1:02:12.041
Machines and humans aren't the same.
Don't push yourself.

1:02:12.458 --> 1:02:13.291
I'll be fine.

1:02:20.791 --> 1:02:24.000
<i>The land howls.</i>
<i>The Burning Mountain will rise.</i>

1:02:24.666 --> 1:02:28.166
<i>That breath is a storm,</i>
<i>that rage is thunder.</i>

1:02:28.833 --> 1:02:32.625
<i>Crossing over distant time,</i>
<i>he commands the power of destruction.</i>

1:02:34.166 --> 1:02:35.708
Godzilla has begun moving.

1:02:36.166 --> 1:02:38.541
How much time left
until the City is complete?

1:02:38.875 --> 1:02:40.833
Twelve hours at the least.

1:02:41.416 --> 1:02:44.666
If we shorten it more,
safety will be sacrificed.

1:02:45.291 --> 1:02:47.208
That bastard still hasn't noticed us.

1:02:47.625 --> 1:02:49.208
Postpone the heat armor plating.

1:02:49.458 --> 1:02:51.958
Finish the counterattack system
in six hours.

1:02:52.375 --> 1:02:53.500
Yeah, let's do it.

1:02:54.708 --> 1:02:57.666
Are you sure?
Provoking Godzilla may not be...

1:02:57.958 --> 1:02:59.708
We can't win by just hiding.

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.958
It's a race to see how much
we can get done before he notices us.

1:03:04.041 --> 1:03:06.625
Terminating heat armor plating
construction process.

1:03:08.458 --> 1:03:13.291
Creation of counterattack system network
energy distribution will be raised by 25%.

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:19.041
-How was the Vulture's final flight test?
-We didn't have enough time.

1:03:19.541 --> 1:03:21.375
How many units are currently ready?

1:03:21.875 --> 1:03:23.833
-Three total.
-How many more can be made?

1:03:24.375 --> 1:03:26.833
We don't have any more power suits
to use as a base.

1:03:27.125 --> 1:03:28.500
We can't make any more.

1:03:28.958 --> 1:03:31.625
One has 300 times more firepower
than a hover.

1:03:31.708 --> 1:03:34.875
With these abilities,
three should be enough for the job.

1:03:35.125 --> 1:03:35.958
Yeah, but...

1:03:36.125 --> 1:03:39.041
But the railgun battery
shoots in three frontal directions,

1:03:39.125 --> 1:03:42.791
and has ten cannons equipped
on each flank, just as you wanted.

1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.791
The cannon's power is 20 times
stronger than before.

1:03:46.083 --> 1:03:48.791
You did a great job
in a short amount of time.

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.625
I want to show you one more thing.

1:03:51.375 --> 1:03:53.458
It's the final blow.

1:03:54.500 --> 1:03:57.416
The EMP harpoon. It's almost complete.

1:03:58.041 --> 1:04:01.916
Once we collapse the shield,
we'll skewer it with this.

1:04:03.875 --> 1:04:04.791
<i>Captain Sakaki!</i>

1:04:05.250 --> 1:04:08.250
The nanometal has gone crazy
and is eating the Bilusaludos!

1:04:08.333 --> 1:04:10.333
-What?
-At this rate, even we'll...

1:04:10.625 --> 1:04:12.750
Where? Galu-gu, send for help!

1:04:12.958 --> 1:04:13.958
Calm down, Haruo.

1:04:14.791 --> 1:04:18.333
It hasn't gone crazy.
It's a form of logical conclusion.

1:04:18.625 --> 1:04:20.291
What are you talking about?

1:04:20.541 --> 1:04:22.458
They sequentially fuse with the City,

1:04:22.791 --> 1:04:26.083
and supports the control unit
as a neural processor.

1:04:26.333 --> 1:04:28.166
Fuses with it, and supports it?

1:04:28.500 --> 1:04:30.083
They've discarded their bodies,

1:04:30.291 --> 1:04:32.750
and you can say they've become
Mechagodzilla City.

1:04:34.166 --> 1:04:36.333
To us, this is a great honor.

1:04:36.916 --> 1:04:41.041
You become an even more efficient being,
and contribute to your peers.

1:04:41.208 --> 1:04:43.875
That's insane!
Such a thing can't be forgiven!

1:04:45.416 --> 1:04:47.375
Don't you want to win against Godzilla?

1:04:48.291 --> 1:04:51.125
With limited time and limited resources,

1:04:51.375 --> 1:04:55.583
it's an obvious decision to begin
discarding the most inefficient thing.

1:04:56.166 --> 1:04:58.375
The physical body
is one such thing, right?

1:05:02.041 --> 1:05:07.708
Metphies mentioned that you guys wanted
to become the same being as monsters.

1:05:08.416 --> 1:05:11.541
Are you planning to give birth
to a new Godzilla on this planet?

1:05:11.625 --> 1:05:14.500
Godzilla is the product
of Earth's civilization.

1:05:14.875 --> 1:05:16.791
You seem to regret this as a mistake,

1:05:17.041 --> 1:05:19.833
but for me,
I commend it as a great achievement.

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:21.000
But...

1:05:21.250 --> 1:05:22.958
If you were to be faulted,

1:05:23.291 --> 1:05:27.291
it's the foolishness that you couldn't
control Godzilla that was generously born.

1:05:28.208 --> 1:05:31.041
Think about
who this planet currently belongs to.

1:05:31.333 --> 1:05:34.375
If Godzilla was the name
given to the environment's ruler,

1:05:34.458 --> 1:05:38.833
we humanoids must attain the goal
of becoming Godzilla.

1:05:39.166 --> 1:05:40.583
Are you being serious?

1:05:40.666 --> 1:05:42.875
To be fused with Mechagodzilla City

1:05:43.083 --> 1:05:46.166
is the same as organisms
evolving to the next stage.

1:05:46.583 --> 1:05:49.250
Instead of being weak creatures
controlled by emotions,

1:05:49.333 --> 1:05:51.833
you'll live in a world of perfect logic.

1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:55.708
If you lose all your emotions and
get absorbed in a world of perfect logic,

1:05:56.083 --> 1:05:58.166
can you really call that evolution?

1:05:59.208 --> 1:06:01.083
-I don't want to do it.
-Me neither.

1:06:01.958 --> 1:06:06.250
So in the end, you guys are the same
as those Houtua bug people?

1:06:06.583 --> 1:06:08.791
You can't differentiate
a bug from a human?

1:06:09.250 --> 1:06:12.916
<i>Beasts serve the environment, and</i>
<i>intelligence rules over the environment.</i>

1:06:13.208 --> 1:06:17.458
<i>And then an innate physical body</i>
<i>is just another part of the environment.</i>

1:06:17.875 --> 1:06:20.791
If you deny evolution
and approve of degeneration,

1:06:21.208 --> 1:06:24.250
you'll only end up like those bug people.

1:06:24.541 --> 1:06:27.250
It's better than
becoming an accessory for a machine!

1:06:27.583 --> 1:06:29.333
Saying accessory is too much!

1:06:29.458 --> 1:06:30.708
Master Sergeant Tani.

1:06:30.791 --> 1:06:33.291
We're about to fight Godzilla with them!

1:06:35.166 --> 1:06:39.458
Captain, only the Bilusaludian volunteers
are fusing with the nanometal.

1:06:39.833 --> 1:06:43.833
They only became like that
so they can fight Godzilla with us.

1:06:44.458 --> 1:06:47.291
Yuko, you're okay with this?

1:06:47.500 --> 1:06:49.416
Why can't I be okay with it?

1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.166
I can't agree to all of the Bilusaludo's
way of thinking.

1:06:54.750 --> 1:06:59.458
But it's better than the Houtua, since we
don't even know what they're thinking.

1:06:59.666 --> 1:07:01.291
Because we can communicate!

1:07:03.250 --> 1:07:04.375
Yes, but however...

1:07:04.958 --> 1:07:07.583
<i>Control, please respond! Control!</i>

1:07:08.208 --> 1:07:11.250
The gas emission from
the nanometal's exterior has stopped.

1:07:11.541 --> 1:07:12.750
-What?
<i>-What's hap--</i>

1:07:14.166 --> 1:07:19.000
Looks like the energy used to generate
the gas has switched to fortifications.

1:07:19.083 --> 1:07:20.583
What do you mean "looks like"?

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.416
Godzilla will notice us.

1:07:22.625 --> 1:07:25.041
Resources should split to fortifications.

1:07:25.500 --> 1:07:28.041
That's what Mechagodzilla City
itself has decided.

1:07:28.166 --> 1:07:29.875
Aren't you the ones managing it?

1:07:30.166 --> 1:07:32.958
It's the ones who fused
with Mechagodzilla City.

1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:38.125
They're already demonstrating abilities
surpassing a normal person's.

1:07:39.541 --> 1:07:40.666
Movement detected.

1:08:01.541 --> 1:08:03.375
Movement direction has changed.

1:08:03.750 --> 1:08:07.583
Moving at 60 kilometers per hour.
It's headed straight towards us.

1:08:07.666 --> 1:08:09.416
So it found this place.

1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:11.500
Fortification status?

1:08:11.666 --> 1:08:14.500
The harpoon's completion
will be in about 30 minutes.

1:08:14.625 --> 1:08:16.875
It will reach this City in about an hour.

1:08:18.500 --> 1:08:21.500
P-Prepare for battle!
Hurry with the fortifications!

1:08:21.958 --> 1:08:28.625
<i>Godzilla.</i>

1:08:30.083 --> 1:08:33.208
<i>The Mountain's roar</i>
<i>will burn the Shining Valley.</i>

1:08:34.791 --> 1:08:36.750
<i>And wherefore is the Baby Chick?</i>

1:08:38.208 --> 1:08:40.791
<i>May it sing on the Shining Valley.</i>

1:08:41.833 --> 1:08:43.333
<i>So proclaims the Egg.</i>

1:08:43.958 --> 1:08:45.625
<i>It is time for a trial.</i>

1:08:47.500 --> 1:08:50.375
Godzilla is decelerating.
Currently 30 kilometers per hour.

1:08:50.791 --> 1:08:53.791
At this rate,
our fortifications will be done first.

1:08:54.958 --> 1:08:56.625
Godzilla has stopped moving.

1:08:57.166 --> 1:08:58.125
Why did it stop?

1:09:01.541 --> 1:09:03.958
-Detecting electromagnetic concentration!
-Galu-gu!

1:09:04.291 --> 1:09:06.750
Deploy thermal energy buffer zone
in the northeast!

1:09:06.958 --> 1:09:09.916
Spraying nanometal particles.
Deploying thermal energy buffer zone.

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.666
Adjust reflection angle
in every laminated armor, hurry!

1:09:12.750 --> 1:09:14.458
Roger, adjusting reflection angle.

1:09:14.750 --> 1:09:17.208
Nanometal particles
replenishing density at 35%.

1:09:17.416 --> 1:09:18.666
Replenishment has compl--

1:09:18.791 --> 1:09:20.500
Electromagnetic concentration, rising!

1:09:21.166 --> 1:09:22.250
Incoming heat ray!

1:09:40.708 --> 1:09:44.958
-Heat ray landed on northeastern rim.
-Thermal energy buffer zone diffused 74%.

1:09:45.416 --> 1:09:46.500
Damage report!

1:09:46.583 --> 1:09:49.958
We avoided a direct hit,
but we lost control of one section.

1:09:50.208 --> 1:09:53.250
No problems.
We can withstand long-distance attacks.

1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:55.791
Godzilla is resuming movement.

1:09:57.458 --> 1:09:58.583
Fortification progress?

1:09:59.583 --> 1:10:02.083
The first harpoon
just went in to its final check.

1:10:02.291 --> 1:10:05.916
The second harpoon's stand was melted
by the heat ray,

1:10:06.333 --> 1:10:08.166
and it'll take 30 minutes to fix it.

1:10:08.250 --> 1:10:09.291
I'll stall it with the Vulture.

1:10:09.541 --> 1:10:12.250
You can't do it alone.
We'll deploy the other two units.

1:10:12.333 --> 1:10:14.625
They haven't been calibrated
with the operating system.

1:10:14.916 --> 1:10:16.791
Copy the settings from Unit 01.

1:10:16.875 --> 1:10:20.291
Master Sergeant Tani's? Then the interface
would be for Earthlings.

1:10:20.375 --> 1:10:24.041
It would be no problem if her colleagues
would volunteer as pilots.

1:10:27.833 --> 1:10:29.958
No signs of a second attack from Godzilla.

1:10:30.875 --> 1:10:32.958
It will reach the City
in about 20 minutes.

1:10:37.583 --> 1:10:40.708
I'll get in Unit 02.
I'll get by with manual controls.

1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:42.125
I'll take Unit 03.

1:10:43.250 --> 1:10:45.791
What are you thinking? A commander can't--

1:10:45.875 --> 1:10:48.166
Everyone's on edge from that argument.

1:10:48.250 --> 1:10:49.750
Alliance's unification is key.

1:10:50.166 --> 1:10:51.833
I'll spearhead the attack.

1:10:52.083 --> 1:10:53.208
-But--
-Galu-gu.

1:10:53.958 --> 1:10:56.166
We only have one thing to do to Godzilla.

1:10:56.458 --> 1:11:00.750
Right now, I'll trust you,
and Mechagodzilla's abilities.

1:11:01.291 --> 1:11:02.125
Haruo. We thank you.

1:11:09.083 --> 1:11:11.125
<i>Galu-gu, what's Godzilla's status?</i>

1:11:11.541 --> 1:11:13.041
<i>There's no second attack.</i>

1:11:13.416 --> 1:11:16.416
<i>It must've sensed</i>
<i>a long-distance attack won't work.</i>

1:11:16.916 --> 1:11:19.958
<i>Vulture, all units standing-by</i>
<i>in arrival and departure deck.</i>

1:11:20.750 --> 1:11:22.083
<i>Confirming blast deflector.</i>

1:11:28.916 --> 1:11:30.916
<i>Unit 01, ready to launch.</i>

1:11:31.166 --> 1:11:34.208
<i>Unit 02, ready for launch.</i>
<i>Haruo, are you ready?</i>

1:11:34.916 --> 1:11:37.708
Yeah, I can go.
First, we need to slow it down.

1:11:38.416 --> 1:11:41.875
Keep firing at its right flank
to try to distract it.

1:11:42.416 --> 1:11:45.000
After reaching a high elevation,
we’ll do a nosedive.

1:11:45.500 --> 1:11:46.333
<i>-Roger.</i>
<i>-Roger.</i>

1:11:47.958 --> 1:11:49.875
All Vultures, launch!

1:12:13.583 --> 1:12:15.208
<i>First flight is going well, huh?</i>

1:12:15.583 --> 1:12:17.541
This is Vulture Unit 03. Status report.

1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:22.416
Godzilla is moving to the crater's rim.
It must be diverted to arranged course.

1:12:22.666 --> 1:12:24.208
Slowing it down, yet diverting?

1:12:24.625 --> 1:12:27.833
With that last attack,
it confirmed our existence.

1:12:27.916 --> 1:12:32.041
Northeast second harpoon stand,
control error reported. It won't function.

1:12:32.958 --> 1:12:35.375
<i>Haruo, the second harpoon won't make it.</i>

1:12:35.833 --> 1:12:36.791
<i>What should we do?</i>

1:12:37.291 --> 1:12:39.000
<i>Discard the second harpoon.</i>

1:12:39.083 --> 1:12:41.916
<i>We'll begin the planned strategy</i>
<i>with just one.</i>

1:12:42.333 --> 1:12:44.958
Deploy forward main battery railgun ports.
Hurry!

1:12:45.833 --> 1:12:47.291
<i>Yuko, Belu-be, did you copy?</i>

1:12:47.666 --> 1:12:49.583
<i>Ascend while circling towards the east.</i>

1:12:49.708 --> 1:12:51.250
<i>We'll lure it to the trap.</i>

1:12:51.916 --> 1:12:52.750
<i>-Roger!</i>
<i>-Roger!</i>

1:12:53.333 --> 1:12:54.166
<i>Let's go!</i> It's not enough.

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.541
-It's ignoring us.
-We can't do it at this distance.

1:13:24.833 --> 1:13:26.458
Switch to close-combat formation.

1:13:26.750 --> 1:13:27.583
<i>-Roger!</i>
<i>-Roger!</i>

1:13:41.333 --> 1:13:42.708
Close-combat is no good, too? Here it comes. Scatter!

1:14:00.083 --> 1:14:02.166
Over here. Come here!

1:14:09.541 --> 1:14:11.708
Godzilla, redirecting to arranged course.

1:14:12.416 --> 1:14:13.250
They did it!

1:14:13.541 --> 1:14:15.208
Is the harpoon going to make it?

1:14:15.916 --> 1:14:18.291
Okay! We'll divert it to the trap point.

1:14:18.875 --> 1:14:19.708
<i>You got it!</i>

1:14:21.458 --> 1:14:23.208
<i>Electromagnetic concentration, rising!</i>

1:14:29.416 --> 1:14:31.416
Godzilla's heat ray blasted near Unit 01!

1:14:31.875 --> 1:14:33.833
<i>-Yuko, are you okay?</i>
<i>-Yes, I'm okay!</i>

1:14:36.291 --> 1:14:38.000
Status report from the surface.

1:14:38.500 --> 1:14:42.500
Godzilla's estimated energy output
for the heat ray, three terawatts.

1:14:43.041 --> 1:14:44.750
It's far beyond our estimations.

1:14:44.833 --> 1:14:47.666
How can you possibly defeat
such a monster.

1:14:48.541 --> 1:14:51.583
Captain Sakaki, perhaps you got yourself
in too much trouble.

1:14:58.916 --> 1:15:01.250
<i>Diversion on track,</i>
<i>800 meters to the trap point.</i>

1:15:02.500 --> 1:15:04.958
<i>All trap sections</i>
<i>operations system check complete.</i>

1:15:05.541 --> 1:15:06.750
<i>Activation prepared.</i>

1:15:07.916 --> 1:15:10.416
First harpoon, error from the final check.

1:15:10.625 --> 1:15:13.750
What?
But Godzilla is almost at the trap point!

1:15:14.208 --> 1:15:16.000
-What should we do?
-Haruo!

1:15:16.083 --> 1:15:17.291
We have to buy time!

1:15:19.958 --> 1:15:21.666
Concentrate fire at its feet!

1:15:35.416 --> 1:15:36.250
One more time!

1:15:37.916 --> 1:15:39.125
Switch attack position!

1:15:48.708 --> 1:15:50.333
Godzilla, same movement speed.

1:15:51.875 --> 1:15:54.833
-What's going on with the first harpoon!
-It still needs time.

1:15:56.625 --> 1:15:58.250
We can't stall it anymore.

1:16:00.333 --> 1:16:02.541
Just 50 more meters... 30 meters...

1:16:03.791 --> 1:16:04.875
It's at the trap point!

1:16:05.250 --> 1:16:06.250
Do it, Galu-gu!

1:16:06.541 --> 1:16:08.375
Damn it all. Fall!

1:16:13.791 --> 1:16:16.541
-Yes!
<i>-Release fake armor plating!</i>

1:16:16.666 --> 1:16:18.666
<i>Godzilla, falling through the trap point!</i>

1:16:19.916 --> 1:16:21.000
<i>Open detour!</i>

1:16:22.083 --> 1:16:24.000
<i>Opening detour to the capture point!</i>

1:16:24.333 --> 1:16:27.666
Galu-gu, deploy the thermal energy
buffer zone to maximum density.

1:16:27.833 --> 1:16:30.333
Leave it to me!
Spray the nanometal particles.

1:16:31.083 --> 1:16:34.291
Spraying nanometal particles,
deploying thermal energy buffer zone.

1:16:35.375 --> 1:16:38.375
<i>Haruo, I'm counting on you</i>
<i>to divert it to the capture point.</i>

1:16:38.458 --> 1:16:39.750
Yeah. Yuko, Belu-be!

1:16:39.833 --> 1:16:41.791
<i>-Do you copy?</i>
-We need to be bait, right?

1:16:41.875 --> 1:16:43.125
Let's get to it!

1:16:43.208 --> 1:16:44.208
All units, descend!

1:16:49.875 --> 1:16:51.750
Electromagnetic concentration, rising!

1:16:51.958 --> 1:16:53.500
-It's coming!
<i>-Haruo!</i>

1:17:01.625 --> 1:17:02.791
-Haruo!
-Haruo!

1:17:04.166 --> 1:17:05.000
I'm fine!

1:17:05.458 --> 1:17:06.291
What was that?

1:17:07.333 --> 1:17:08.708
So they saved me again.

1:17:13.166 --> 1:17:14.958
The buffer zone has diffused 92%!

1:17:15.416 --> 1:17:16.750
Direct hit damage is light!

1:17:16.833 --> 1:17:19.833
Godzilla is taking the detour
to the capture point.

1:17:23.916 --> 1:17:26.083
First harpoon final checks complete.

1:17:26.750 --> 1:17:27.666
Ready to fire.

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:28.833
They made it.

1:17:29.916 --> 1:17:31.333
Of course, we're Bilusaludo.

1:17:31.625 --> 1:17:35.000
Don’t let it notice the harpoons.
Keep its attention.

1:17:35.083 --> 1:17:36.750
-Roger.
-Roger.

1:17:48.750 --> 1:17:50.333
Begin diversion attacks.

1:17:58.458 --> 1:18:00.791
Godzilla is accelerating
to the capture point.

1:18:01.041 --> 1:18:03.625
Yes, come towards your grave!

1:18:07.125 --> 1:18:09.458
Godzilla is slashing its surroundings
with its tail!

1:18:09.583 --> 1:18:11.250
Doesn't matter, keep firing!

1:18:19.083 --> 1:18:20.958
Just 900 meters to the capture point.

1:18:21.625 --> 1:18:22.958
Don't get so cocky! Fire! Fire like crazy!

1:18:30.833 --> 1:18:32.916
We'll get swept in, stand-by above.

1:18:34.291 --> 1:18:35.833
About 500 meters until arrival.

1:18:43.458 --> 1:18:44.875
Almost at the capture point.

1:18:50.666 --> 1:18:53.125
-Godzilla has reached the capture point!
-Galu-gu!

1:18:53.208 --> 1:18:55.958
Close off the detour.
Pour liquid nanometal!

1:18:56.625 --> 1:18:59.708
Closing off the detour.
Pouring the liquid nanometal.

1:19:12.583 --> 1:19:15.791
Liquid nanometal, effective filling point,
30% remaining...

1:19:16.375 --> 1:19:17.208
<i>10%...</i>

1:19:18.958 --> 1:19:19.916
Begin hardening!

1:19:21.791 --> 1:19:24.125
Nanometal hardened! We have 30 seconds!

1:19:24.208 --> 1:19:25.291
Open fire!

1:19:35.833 --> 1:19:39.166
Godzilla electromagnetic wave noise
synchronization! Sync rate, 90%.

1:19:39.666 --> 1:19:42.208
Flanking cannons, synchronized attack
on its dorsal fin.

1:19:42.583 --> 1:19:44.916
Flanking cannons, firing at dorsal fins.

1:19:45.250 --> 1:19:47.291
Meta material shield is about to collapse.

1:19:47.708 --> 1:19:50.958
-Sync rate, 95%.
-Confirming resonance with noise waves.

1:19:53.416 --> 1:19:57.791
Five, four, three, two, one...

1:19:58.583 --> 1:19:59.916
-Synced!
-Fire!

1:20:04.833 --> 1:20:05.750
Target hit!

1:20:06.166 --> 1:20:07.500
Dorsal fin, destroyed!

1:20:08.083 --> 1:20:10.250
Shield output, dropping to 80%.

1:20:12.458 --> 1:20:15.458
Output dropping further, now under 30%.

1:20:16.833 --> 1:20:17.666
Almost!

1:20:18.875 --> 1:20:20.625
-Shield has collapsed!
-Now!

1:20:20.708 --> 1:20:21.875
EMP harpoon...

1:20:23.625 --> 1:20:24.458
fire! Cease fire!

1:20:31.666 --> 1:20:32.708
Status report!

1:20:32.916 --> 1:20:35.083
EMP harpoon has pierced Godzilla.

1:20:35.666 --> 1:20:38.083
Depth secured
for electromagnetic pulse emission.

1:20:39.333 --> 1:20:40.166
Did we do it? Come on!

1:20:41.166 --> 1:20:43.666
Now, let your electromagnetic waves
run rampant!

1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:45.333
Firing electromagnetic pulse.

1:20:48.083 --> 1:20:49.791
-Die!
-That'll teach you!

1:20:50.291 --> 1:20:51.291
This is your end.

1:21:10.916 --> 1:21:11.750
We did it!

1:21:12.291 --> 1:21:14.208
-We finally did it!
-We did it!

1:21:14.291 --> 1:21:15.291
Godzilla, silent!

1:21:15.458 --> 1:21:17.250
Electromagnetic waves, overloading.

1:21:17.625 --> 1:21:20.416
Now, fly to pieces, you bastard.

1:21:38.333 --> 1:21:39.458
Why won't it explode?

1:21:39.708 --> 1:21:42.250
Don't panic,
send the observation data to the City.

1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:48.458
Barometric pressure
around Godzilla is changing.

1:21:48.750 --> 1:21:49.583
What?

1:22:04.208 --> 1:22:05.250
What's going on?

1:22:05.333 --> 1:22:06.875
Godzilla isn't exploding.

1:22:07.375 --> 1:22:09.416
The plan succeeded, right?

1:22:09.958 --> 1:22:11.541
That's what I hope for, but..

1:22:11.833 --> 1:22:14.625
Temperature around Godzilla is rising.

1:22:15.083 --> 1:22:16.791
It's over 500°, and rising...

1:22:17.541 --> 1:22:18.375
<i>Now 600°...</i>

1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:20.541
Just burn down.

1:22:20.750 --> 1:22:21.583
Now 800°...

1:22:23.500 --> 1:22:24.708
<i>Now over 1000°!</i>

1:22:24.791 --> 1:22:25.666
Why!

1:22:26.375 --> 1:22:29.208
What if it was changing the overload
into heat...

1:22:29.875 --> 1:22:31.875
Will it not be killed by the heat?

1:22:32.916 --> 1:22:35.750
No, something even more terrifying
is about to happen.

1:22:44.958 --> 1:22:46.916
<i>The barrier around Godzilla is melting.</i>

1:22:47.166 --> 1:22:49.666
<i>The surrounding area's temperature</i>
<i>is over 1000°!</i>

1:22:49.750 --> 1:22:51.291
<i>The shield remains collapsed.</i>

1:22:52.333 --> 1:22:54.500
The temperature in this room
is also rising!

1:22:55.666 --> 1:22:58.291
I see, so that's what's happening.

1:22:58.916 --> 1:23:02.291
The heat isn't just spreading.
It's some form of molecular management.

1:23:02.916 --> 1:23:06.041
It's attacking us.
There's no point in shooting it.

1:23:06.125 --> 1:23:07.708
<i>We'd get burned alive.</i>

1:23:08.333 --> 1:23:11.125
<i>Room temperature steadily rising,</i>
<i>becoming unmanageable.</i>

1:23:11.500 --> 1:23:13.208
<i>Control, what's going on!</i>

1:23:13.541 --> 1:23:15.166
This place isn't safe! Evacuate!

1:23:15.250 --> 1:23:16.083
Right!

1:23:16.250 --> 1:23:17.250
Don't be flustered.

1:23:18.583 --> 1:23:22.666
People have lost because of what they
are, but now's the time to turn it around.

1:23:23.333 --> 1:23:24.166
Everyone!

1:23:25.083 --> 1:23:27.125
Now is the time for us to use the blade

1:23:27.375 --> 1:23:30.208
of knowledge and purpose,
and cut the chains of destiny!

1:23:31.083 --> 1:23:34.333
Steel yourselves!
Allow yourselves to be consumed by it!

1:23:34.708 --> 1:23:38.958
At the land of beginning, ever since
the first axe struck a tree in the forest,

1:23:39.583 --> 1:23:42.166
-this is the future that was promised!
-This is...

1:23:42.291 --> 1:23:45.833
It's either that bastard or us
who survives as the ruler.

1:23:47.708 --> 1:23:49.375
The battle is just starting.

1:23:50.541 --> 1:23:52.583
No way. I'll take no part in this.

1:23:53.291 --> 1:23:54.500
Let's go, everyone.

1:23:56.416 --> 1:23:58.458
So they were inferior races after all.

1:23:59.250 --> 1:24:00.416
This way! Hurry up!

1:24:00.750 --> 1:24:01.583
Professor!

1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:07.125
But Haruo...

1:24:09.083 --> 1:24:11.458
I want to believe that you're different.

1:24:11.916 --> 1:24:15.416
Answer me, Galu-gu!
Damn it! What should I do?

1:24:15.500 --> 1:24:17.333
Haruo, let's continue the attack.

1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.916
That heat is produced
by the molecular vibration’s energy

1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.458
not being focused,
but being released uncontrollably.

1:24:23.541 --> 1:24:26.916
We need to make it focus the energy
so it can blast another heat ray.

1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:29.208
Okay, we'll provoke it.

1:24:29.625 --> 1:24:31.291
-Yuko, are you ready?
-Roger!

1:24:47.791 --> 1:24:49.083
We can't get any closer.

1:24:49.375 --> 1:24:53.083
<i>All units, maintain rotation</i>
<i>at this distance. Open fire!</i>

1:25:08.125 --> 1:25:10.166
Let's hurry and get away from the City!

1:25:10.250 --> 1:25:11.875
Otherwise we'll be burned alive!

1:25:13.458 --> 1:25:17.250
<i>Go towards the southern part of the rim.</i>
<i>You'll see a crevice in the rock wall.</i>

1:25:17.916 --> 1:25:18.958
Metphies!

1:25:23.708 --> 1:25:25.708
All units, withdraw and ascend!

1:25:30.375 --> 1:25:32.541
With that heat,
we can't get in shooting range.

1:25:32.875 --> 1:25:35.208
Can we not fire the harpoons?

1:25:35.833 --> 1:25:37.208
The mount has melted.

1:25:39.375 --> 1:25:41.750
Haruo. There's a proposal from the City.

1:25:42.416 --> 1:25:45.416
<i>Ascend up to the Tropopause,</i>
<i>and power dive!</i> <i>We'll acquire enough speed</i>
<i>to pierce Godzilla.</i>

1:25:49.666 --> 1:25:51.583
<i>We will become the spear itself!</i>

1:25:52.333 --> 1:25:54.083
You mean, a suicide bombing attack?

1:25:54.500 --> 1:25:57.125
<i>In our final form,</i>
<i>there shouldn't be any problems.</i>

1:25:57.625 --> 1:26:00.791
<i>We'll be successful with not one,</i>
<i>not two, but three units.</i>

1:26:00.916 --> 1:26:03.791
But we can't even get close
with that high temperature.

1:26:04.041 --> 1:26:07.875
<i>Based on the Vulture's construction,</i>
<i>there's only one part susceptible to heat.</i>

1:26:07.958 --> 1:26:10.000
<i>If we repair that part with nanometal,</i>

1:26:10.291 --> 1:26:12.875
<i>theoretically it will hold out</i>
<i>for ten seconds.</i>

1:26:13.416 --> 1:26:14.333
What are you saying?

1:26:15.333 --> 1:26:16.750
The part susceptible to heat?

1:26:17.708 --> 1:26:18.541
Where is it? Galu-gu!

1:26:21.125 --> 1:26:23.333
<i>It's you, Haruo.</i>

1:26:23.750 --> 1:26:25.458
What the hell do you mean?

1:26:33.958 --> 1:26:35.041
Wh-What?

1:26:36.541 --> 1:26:37.375
Yuko!

1:26:37.500 --> 1:26:39.416
-Ow! It hurts!
-Fusing with nanometal

1:26:39.666 --> 1:26:41.166
<i>was only for volunteers!</i>

1:26:41.708 --> 1:26:43.166
<i>Galu-gu! Galu-gu!</i>

1:26:43.583 --> 1:26:46.458
It only hurts in the beginning.
You'll be at ease soon.

1:26:47.125 --> 1:26:48.833
Relax and surrender yourself.

1:26:50.375 --> 1:26:52.291
This is the only way to defeat Godzilla.

1:26:52.958 --> 1:26:56.166
If we let this chance escape,
then we have no chance of winning.

1:26:56.833 --> 1:26:59.208
-But...
-No! I don't want to!

1:27:00.125 --> 1:27:00.958
No way!

1:27:04.041 --> 1:27:06.625
Don't try to eject. You'll burn to death!

1:27:10.708 --> 1:27:11.958
Yuko!

1:27:23.416 --> 1:27:25.875
Did you bastards trick us?

1:27:26.750 --> 1:27:28.750
<i>Haruo, my comrade.</i>

1:27:29.541 --> 1:27:31.250
I know you would understand.

1:27:31.958 --> 1:27:34.166
You, who hates Godzilla just as much.

1:27:35.833 --> 1:27:38.708
Once the fusion is complete,
we'll be true brothers-in-arms.

1:27:39.416 --> 1:27:42.416
I'll go ahead. I'll see you at the top.

1:27:45.333 --> 1:27:46.166
<i>Stop...</i>

1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:50.125
<i>Please help me.</i>

1:27:50.708 --> 1:27:51.541
Yuko.

1:27:52.708 --> 1:27:54.916
-What should I do?
<i>-Haruo.</i>

1:27:58.416 --> 1:28:01.625
Why?
Why won't your body accept the nanometal?

1:28:02.375 --> 1:28:04.541
<i>There’s no data</i>
<i>for this antibody response.</i>

1:28:04.958 --> 1:28:08.291
<i>What did you do to your body!</i>

1:28:08.708 --> 1:28:10.750
<i>Haruo, do you copy? Haruo!</i>

1:28:11.125 --> 1:28:11.958
Metphies!

1:28:12.291 --> 1:28:15.791
I'm sorry, there were communication
disturbances so I couldn't reach you.

1:28:15.875 --> 1:28:17.708
<i>Metphies! What are you doing?</i>

1:28:18.333 --> 1:28:20.125
<i>-Metphies!</i>
-I heard what's happening.

1:28:20.208 --> 1:28:21.375
Are you okay?

1:28:21.666 --> 1:28:23.500
<i>I'm fine, but Yuko is...</i>

1:28:23.833 --> 1:28:24.666
Listen closely.

1:28:25.166 --> 1:28:27.000
Hey, what are you doing, Metphies?

1:28:27.500 --> 1:28:30.000
To stop the nanometal
from running rampant,

1:28:30.250 --> 1:28:33.416
its behavior should be under control
at Galu-gu's control unit.

1:28:33.500 --> 1:28:35.208
<i>Metphies, you bastard!</i>

1:28:35.291 --> 1:28:39.750
If you destroy it, it should all stop, and
Master Sergeant Tani's encroachment, too.

1:28:40.291 --> 1:28:42.125
Pull yourself together, Haruo.

1:28:42.458 --> 1:28:44.375
Finishing off Godzilla is priority.

1:28:45.041 --> 1:28:45.875
But...

1:28:46.125 --> 1:28:49.208
At this rate, Mechagodzilla City
will not only consume Godzilla,

1:28:49.583 --> 1:28:51.000
but everything as well!

1:28:51.333 --> 1:28:55.083
That thing's propagation will not stop
until it has consumed the entire Earth!

1:28:55.541 --> 1:28:59.166
<i>We are so close to defeating Godzilla!</i>
<i>Isn't that what you wanted?</i>

1:28:59.250 --> 1:29:02.541
<i>Even if that's a victory for Bilusado,</i>
<i>it's not a victory for Haruo!</i>

1:29:02.625 --> 1:29:04.458
<i>All this time, and you betray us, Exif?</i>

1:29:04.541 --> 1:29:08.041
<i>Just because a machine carried out</i>
<i>the function to kill Godzilla,</i>

1:29:08.166 --> 1:29:10.083
<i>what glory would that bring?</i>

1:29:10.166 --> 1:29:12.708
<i>-Victory is grasped beyond fear and grief.</i>
<i>-What's wrong with that?</i>

1:29:13.208 --> 1:29:15.875
<i>-People's dignity should be there.</i>
<i>-Hey, are you listening?</i>

1:29:15.958 --> 1:29:16.791
<i>Haruo!</i>

1:29:18.083 --> 1:29:19.666
<i>Electromagnetic waves detected.</i>

1:29:20.041 --> 1:29:21.750
<i>Godzilla will soon resume activity.</i>

1:29:23.416 --> 1:29:25.458
<i>-The shield is regenerating!</i>
<i>-Haruo!</i>

1:29:25.750 --> 1:29:28.291
<i>-You cannot lose sight...</i>
<i>-Don't be fooled by that religious freak!</i>

1:29:28.375 --> 1:29:31.083
<i>-of things that have moved you forward!</i>
<i>-Remember your duty!</i>

1:29:39.083 --> 1:29:40.458
<i>What are you doing, Haruo?</i>

1:29:40.708 --> 1:29:41.541
Answer me!

1:29:51.041 --> 1:29:53.541
Galu-gu,
stop the nanometal's encroachment.

1:29:54.208 --> 1:29:55.041
Right now!

1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:58.958
With Godzilla right in front us,
there's only one thing to do.

1:29:59.041 --> 1:30:00.708
You're the one who said that.

1:30:00.958 --> 1:30:04.916
The only thing we need to do
is defeat Godzilla as humans!

1:30:05.291 --> 1:30:08.416
Haruo, why do you not realize
the contradiction in what you say?

1:30:08.583 --> 1:30:09.625
<i>What?</i>

1:30:09.750 --> 1:30:12.458
All monsters, and Godzilla,
are called monsters

1:30:12.625 --> 1:30:15.583
because it cannot be defeated by people.

1:30:16.375 --> 1:30:18.916
To defeat what has surpassed
human intellect

1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:21.583
is no longer within the category
of human achievement.

1:30:22.625 --> 1:30:25.375
<i>From the moment you decided</i>
<i>that you'd defeat Godzilla,</i>

1:30:25.458 --> 1:30:28.750
<i>you were aspiring to become something</i>
<i>that is no longer human, Haruo!</i>

1:30:31.125 --> 1:30:32.125
You're wrong!

1:30:33.541 --> 1:30:34.375
<i>I...</i>

1:30:34.750 --> 1:30:36.916
If you want to win,
then steel your resolve!

1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:40.166
You'll surpass humanity, and Godzilla,
and become something greater!

1:30:42.041 --> 1:30:42.875
Haruo!

1:30:45.833 --> 1:30:47.500
Stop, Haruo!

1:30:51.041 --> 1:30:52.041
Haruo!

1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:55.875
<i>It is time for a trial, Haruo.</i>

1:31:21.833 --> 1:31:23.375
Haruo!

1:32:34.500 --> 1:32:36.125
Mechagodzilla City is...

1:32:37.666 --> 1:32:38.500
sinking. Yuko!

1:33:11.791 --> 1:33:14.791
Yuko! Yuko, hang in there. Yuko!

1:33:16.708 --> 1:33:17.541
Yuko.

1:37:55.666 --> 1:37:57.041
Yuko! Yuko!

1:38:18.375 --> 1:38:19.208
<i>Haruo!</i>

1:38:26.375 --> 1:38:28.250
<i>...is to gather all intelligence.</i>

1:38:28.333 --> 1:38:30.500
<i>Right now, what's important...</i>
<i>Tens of thousands of years ago...</i>

1:38:30.583 --> 1:38:32.125
<i>destroyed by monsters...</i>
<i>became wanderers of space.</i>

1:38:32.208 --> 1:38:34.625
<i>Our mother planet also...</i>
<i>...to defeat the evil being.</i>

1:38:34.708 --> 1:38:36.250
<i>Don't lose sight of the main goal.</i>

1:38:36.333 --> 1:38:41.041
<i>However, if you remain lost and arrive</i>
<i>at God's Gate, you shall not pass through.</i>

1:38:48.250 --> 1:38:51.750
<i>In essence, it's a wicked thing.</i>
<i>It's no different from a monster.</i>

1:38:51.833 --> 1:38:54.875
<i>They are not trying to unify</i>
<i>the galaxy's intelligence.</i>

1:38:54.958 --> 1:38:58.166
<i>But instead, it's as if they want</i>
<i>to become one with monsters.</i>

1:38:58.250 --> 1:39:00.666
<i>...that toward the end of many planets'</i>
<i>civilization's development,</i>

1:39:00.750 --> 1:39:01.791
<i>they gave birth to monsters.</i>

1:39:01.875 --> 1:39:05.041
<i>Those with intelligence</i>
<i>will become lost, angry, and grieve.</i>

1:39:05.125 --> 1:39:08.208
<i>Our battle must be something beyond that.</i>

1:39:12.166 --> 1:39:13.000
Metphies.

1:39:13.583 --> 1:39:16.458
Was your planet
destroyed by monsters, too?

1:39:17.291 --> 1:39:18.125
Yes.

1:39:19.375 --> 1:39:22.458
To that which brought
the end of our civilization,

1:39:22.958 --> 1:39:25.208
we hesitate greatly
to carelessly say its name.

1:39:26.333 --> 1:39:29.750
Words just have that much strength.

1:39:30.125 --> 1:39:31.791
So it's like a bad omen?

1:39:32.791 --> 1:39:33.625
But Haruo,

1:39:34.750 --> 1:39:40.416
to you who is about to face Godzilla,
I should probably tell you.

1:39:41.250 --> 1:39:44.750
The destructive name that we Exif
have been secretly hiding.

1:39:45.291 --> 1:39:46.166
Why me?

1:39:46.375 --> 1:39:49.750
Remember it when you're in battle,
and about to be swallowed in fear.

1:39:50.083 --> 1:39:54.125
There is a far greater destructive power
lurking somewhere in space.

1:39:54.500 --> 1:39:58.708
Compared to that,
Godzilla would not even be worth the fear.

1:40:00.291 --> 1:40:01.125
Hey, hey...

1:40:06.250 --> 1:40:07.083
It's Ghidorah.
