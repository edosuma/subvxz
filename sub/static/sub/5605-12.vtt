You're so lucky you get to be
in junior G.I. Joes.

00:09.341 --> 00:10.840
Once a week,
you don't have to think

00:10.842 --> 00:12.775
about what you're gonna wear,
putting on makeup.

00:12.777 --> 00:15.344
You get to go,
"Today, I'm a dude."

00:15.346 --> 00:18.647
And you're lucky I don't want
to get blood on my uniform.

00:18.649 --> 00:21.383
Come on!
Come on, no kitchen violence.

00:21.385 --> 00:23.885
I haven't even had
any coffee yet.

00:23.887 --> 00:26.153
Okay, there we go.
All right. Go on.

00:26.155 --> 00:28.054
Ooh! (sighs)
Hey, where were you?

00:28.056 --> 00:30.689
(laughs)
Training for the Polar Run.

00:30.691 --> 00:31.990
Ah, the Polar Run.

00:31.992 --> 00:34.058
A thousand people
chasing five Kenyans

00:34.060 --> 00:35.993
through the streets
of Denver.

00:35.995 --> 00:38.962
The Kenyans always win,
but the good news is my team,

00:38.964 --> 00:42.165
the Michigan Wolver-Runners,
always beats your mom's team.

00:42.167 --> 00:45.834
<i>The</i> Ohio State University...

00:45.836 --> 00:47.468
Runners.

00:47.470 --> 00:50.804
Who have lost<i> the</i> race
ever since we started.

00:50.806 --> 00:52.238
(laughs)

00:52.240 --> 00:54.807
How did this stupid rivalry
even get started?

00:54.809 --> 00:56.341
Well,
your dad and I had

00:56.343 --> 00:58.576
some of our alumni friends
over one year

00:58.578 --> 01:00.878
to watch the Michigan/
Ohio State football game.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.046
Ohio State crowd came over,
and they were amazed

01:03.048 --> 01:05.848
we had one of those
talking picture boxes.

01:05.850 --> 01:08.517
Oh, oh, oh, and -- and Michigan
actually won that year.

01:08.519 --> 01:10.652
That's right. Yeah, so you
know it was a while ago.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.153
Ouch.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.922
Anyway, uh, the Polar Run
was the next day,

01:14.924 --> 01:16.924
so we decided to make it
a friendly competition --

01:16.926 --> 01:19.426
Michigan alums
versus Ohio State alums --

01:19.428 --> 01:21.161
and it's been a tradition
ever since.

01:21.163 --> 01:23.196
I'm surprised you don't do
the Polar Run, Eve.

01:23.198 --> 01:25.264
You never miss a chance
to do something sweaty.

01:25.266 --> 01:26.698
Well, in ROT-C,

01:26.700 --> 01:29.267
we run for God and country,
not a plastic trophy

01:29.269 --> 01:31.702
of a polar bear
giving me a thumbs up.

01:31.704 --> 01:32.736
Buh-bye!

01:32.738 --> 01:33.937
Bye.
Bye-bye.

01:33.939 --> 01:35.605
You know, Mike,

01:35.607 --> 01:38.040
this might be the year we
finally beat you. Yeah.

01:38.042 --> 01:39.841
(door opens) Team Ohio
State has been working out,

01:39.843 --> 01:41.542
and you have not been training at all.
(door closes)

01:41.544 --> 01:43.110
I should work my arms out
a little bit.

01:43.112 --> 01:45.312
God knows I'll be doing
high-fiving at the finish line.

01:46.581 --> 01:50.883
You are so cute
when you're overconfident.

01:50.885 --> 01:52.284
Overconfident?
Yep.

01:52.286 --> 01:53.718
You know our star runner, right?
Mm-hmm.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.386
Former college track star
Cathy Thomas?

01:55.388 --> 01:57.020
5'5," brown hair --

01:57.022 --> 01:59.622
kind of a blur as she speeds
by you to the finish line?

01:59.624 --> 02:01.223
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember.
But admit it,

02:01.225 --> 02:03.091
if it wasn't for Cathy, you guys
would never win, so, no.

02:03.093 --> 02:04.459
Okay, I admit it,
but we have her,

02:04.461 --> 02:05.793
we are gonna win,
and I'm okay with that.

02:05.795 --> 02:07.528
All right,
I'll tell you what,

02:07.530 --> 02:09.129
let's make this year's race
a little more interesting.

02:09.131 --> 02:10.263

Okay? Yeah, yeah.

our next vacation.

It's probably Cathy now.
Oh.

02:31.147 --> 02:33.881
She said she'd come by
to drop off the race packets.

02:33.883 --> 02:35.649
Ask her if she wants to come in
and rest her feet.

02:35.651 --> 02:37.751
Why, because they're smoking
from the run over?

02:37.753 --> 02:40.153
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey!

Ed? You --
You wanted to see me?

16:40.942 --> 16:42.608
Yes, come in, Kristin.
Yeah.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.611
I just want to check and see
how things are going with Wendi.

16:45.613 --> 16:47.112
Well, uh...

16:47.114 --> 16:49.447
Enough said.
Fire her.

16:49.449 --> 16:50.881
Excuse me?

16:50.883 --> 16:53.283
You heard me.
Give her the boot.

16:54.286 --> 16:56.886
She's up here constantly.

16:56.888 --> 16:58.387
I can't get
any work done.

16:58.389 --> 16:59.621
I'm -- I'm sorry, Ed.

16:59.623 --> 17:00.888
I-I don't really
feel comfortable

17:00.890 --> 17:02.389
firing your girlfriend.

17:02.391 --> 17:04.124
Now, look. WENDI:
Eddie, you in there?

17:04.126 --> 17:06.059
Yes.
Come in, sweetheart.

17:06.061 --> 17:07.593
You're right.
I'll take care of it.

17:07.595 --> 17:09.094
I'll take care of it.

17:10.063 --> 17:13.697
What do you mean,
Wendi's not working out?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.532
Y-You want me to fire her?

17:15.534 --> 17:16.533
You want to fire me?

17:16.535 --> 17:18.067
No, I-I wh--
I-I just --

17:18.069 --> 17:20.869
She said she won't take
your crap another minute.

17:20.871 --> 17:22.604
Kristin, is that true?

17:22.606 --> 17:24.606
You know, I'm trying to defend
you, but she won't budge.

17:24.608 --> 17:25.640
(scoffs)

17:25.642 --> 17:28.275
Uh, yeah, Wendi.

17:28.277 --> 17:30.944
Uh, it looks like
we're gonna have to let you go.

17:30.946 --> 17:32.245
(both sigh)

17:32.247 --> 17:34.447
Won't you give her
one more chance?

17:34.449 --> 17:35.781
Ed...

17:35.783 --> 17:37.315
Of course not.
Your mind is made up.

17:37.317 --> 17:40.651
You Baxters
are stubborn people.

17:40.653 --> 17:42.486
So, that's it?
I'm fired?

17:42.488 --> 17:43.954
I'm sorry, darling.

17:43.956 --> 17:45.555
We'll just gather up
your things.

17:45.557 --> 17:47.290
I'll talk to you later.
Go ahead. All right.

17:47.292 --> 17:49.091
I have a few choice words
that I want to share

17:49.093 --> 17:50.725
with my restaurant manager here.
Okay.

17:53.329 --> 17:54.928
(sighs)

17:54.930 --> 17:56.095
That was painless.

17:56.097 --> 17:58.163
(scoffs)
Maybe for you.

17:58.165 --> 17:59.497
She's gonna hate me now!

17:59.499 --> 18:01.165
Yeah, well, thank you,

18:01.167 --> 18:03.167
but I'm the one who's gonna
have to hear about it later.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.335
I mean, who do you think's
the real victim here?

19:14.332 --> 19:17.199
What's the most painful feeling
in the world

19:17.201 --> 19:20.301
other than sliding off the seat
of your Schwinn onto that bar?

19:21.971 --> 19:23.370
Seeing your kids hurting

19:23.372 --> 19:25.872
and not being able
to do anything about it.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.040
My instinct is to try
to control everything,

19:28.042 --> 19:31.209
you know, preferably
with a universal remote,

19:31.211 --> 19:32.743
but there's no
fast-forward button

19:32.745 --> 19:34.244

19:34.246 --> 19:37.380
You've got to watch it
real time, like Hulu.

19:37.382 --> 19:40.750
Now we ask God to grant us
the serenity to accept

19:40.752 --> 19:42.585
the things we cannot change.

19:42.587 --> 19:44.386
Then we take his name in vain

19:44.388 --> 19:46.855

stops short at a yellow light.

Come on. Everyone knows
yellow means punch it!

19:51.194 --> 19:53.761
Now, accepting our powerlessness
is tough,

19:53.763 --> 19:57.097
and it's especially brutal when
it comes to protecting our kids,

19:57.099 --> 19:59.332
but those are the times
you have to take a deep breath,

19:59.334 --> 20:02.201
trust in God,
and not do anything stupid.

20:02.203 --> 20:04.102
If you're determined to do
something stupid

20:04.104 --> 20:08.272

this big office is.

21:00.748 --> 21:01.947
Where you going with this?

21:01.949 --> 21:03.982
So I told Wendi
that you guys

21:03.984 --> 21:06.117
could actually spend
more time together

21:16.960 --> 21:18.559
and the first order
