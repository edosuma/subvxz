Strut your stuff,
my fetching friend!

07:48.337 --> 07:51.601
This is it, folks.
Six ticks left on the clock.

07:51.775 --> 07:54.778
Looks like the Quakers
are about to lose
another heartbreaker.

07:54.952 --> 07:56.301
There's the snap.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.477
Walls drops back.

07:57.651 --> 07:58.565
And he fumbles!

07:58.739 --> 07:59.783
But wait,

07:59.957 --> 08:02.264
Corbett, he squirts
out of the pile!

08:02.438 --> 08:03.961
Whoa, look at the veins
on Principal Ball's head.

08:04.135 --> 08:05.049
He laterals back
to Spink!

08:05.223 --> 08:05.963
He's really getting into it.

08:06.137 --> 08:07.791
Spink back to Walls, and...

08:07.965 --> 08:10.011
And there's daylight!
There's daylight!

08:10.185 --> 08:14.798
He...could...go...
all...the...way!

08:14.972 --> 08:17.366
Touchdown! Touchdown!

08:17.540 --> 08:19.324
What are we
so excited about?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.717
Is the band coming back
on the field?

08:20.891 --> 08:22.545
We won! We won!

08:22.719 --> 08:24.068
I'm going down there.

08:24.242 --> 08:26.027
Maybe a lineman will give me
a hip pad as a souvenir!

08:26.723 --> 08:30.248
Oh, [BLEEP].

08:30.422 --> 08:32.337
ADULT ADAM: While I missed
the biggest play ever,

08:32.512 --> 08:34.818
my dad was taking a swing
making nice with the neighbor.

08:34.992 --> 08:36.298
Hey, Wofsy.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.430
Here's your rake.
Are we good?

08:38.605 --> 08:41.477
This isn't my rake.
This is a small hand rake.

08:41.651 --> 08:44.045
I loaned you
a full-size leaf rake.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.742
A rake's a rake.

08:45.916 --> 08:48.397
Every autumn,
I love gathering
all the fallen leaves.

08:48.571 --> 08:51.008
I build a big pile,
and sometimes,
I frolic in it.

08:51.182 --> 08:52.053
You took that from me.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.055
Fine. I'll buy you
another rake

08:54.229 --> 08:55.839
so you can do
your upsetting
leaf business.

08:56.013 --> 08:58.146
Oh, it's not just the rake.

08:58.320 --> 09:01.628
Your kids hit a million balls
and Frisbees over my fence,

09:01.802 --> 09:03.804
and for some reason,
three hockey nets.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.153
You could have
tossed them back over.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.459
I did, and they hit them back,

09:07.634 --> 09:09.810
and then they say,
"We're playing
fence volleyball."

09:09.984 --> 09:11.638
That's between
you and them.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.378
And what about
the avocado tree?

09:13.553 --> 09:16.294
I love guacamole, okay?
Is that a crime?

09:16.468 --> 09:19.689
No, but dangling
your youngest child
from a ladder

09:19.863 --> 09:22.387
to steal your neighbor's
tree treasure is.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.912
Screw this! Screw you!

09:25.086 --> 09:26.478
I need my special
hand-rake back.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.916
Choke on my guac,
Goldberg!

09:29.090 --> 09:31.658
I can't, Wofsy!
'Cause you ran out!

09:31.832 --> 09:33.834
ADULT ADAM: While my dad
dropped the ball,

09:34.008 --> 09:37.489
I was hoping a test audience
wouldn't notice
my costly fumble.

09:37.664 --> 09:41.406
...could...go...
all...the...way!

09:41.581 --> 09:43.974
Touchdown! Touchdown!

09:44.148 --> 09:45.541
What the hell is this?

09:45.715 --> 09:47.587
Why are we looking
at Principal Ball?

09:47.761 --> 09:50.502
Well, Principal Ball's
unbridled enthusiasm

09:50.677 --> 09:52.330
distracted me from
the handsome pigeon
I was filming.

09:52.504 --> 09:53.288
You were filming
a pigeon?

09:53.462 --> 09:54.898
You didn't see
this pigeon.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.900
Birds do have
a mesmerizing way.

09:57.074 --> 09:58.075
Shut up, Matt Bradley.

09:58.249 --> 09:59.424
Birds are the roaches
of the sky.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.252
Is it that bad?

10:01.426 --> 10:03.124
Because the school wants
to do a post-game pep rally

10:03.298 --> 10:04.821
and show the game
at lunch tomorrow.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.780
I'd probably just leave
the country if I were you.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.651
I mean, they're going to hunt
you down wherever you go,

10:08.825 --> 10:10.392
but see a little bit
of this crazy world first.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.960
You should also
change your name.
Maybe Xander Hamlin?

10:13.134 --> 10:16.137
Oh, he can't pull off Xander.
Maybe Bernard or a Chester.

10:16.311 --> 10:17.529
I'm not moving
out of the country

10:17.704 --> 10:18.966
and living a different life
as a Chester.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.707
Then there's only
one solution.

10:20.881 --> 10:21.882
Come clean and...

10:22.056 --> 10:24.188
We re-create
the play on video.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.626
Yes. That sounds reasonable
to me in this moment.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.280
But we're
just four dudes.

10:29.454 --> 10:32.936
Four dudes with the raw skill
and physical perfection
of a varsity football team.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.634
Plus, with
my slick editing,

10:34.808 --> 10:36.113
no one will know
the difference, probably.

10:36.287 --> 10:38.028
ADULT ADAM: At least
that's what I'd hoped,

10:38.202 --> 10:39.943
but they knew the difference,

10:40.117 --> 10:41.728
and were not afraid
to express their opinion.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.861
[CROWD BOOING ANGRILY]

10:45.035 --> 10:45.949
Dude, what did you do?

10:46.123 --> 10:48.256
A seamless re-creation?

10:48.430 --> 10:50.388
That's clearly your brother
and his idiot friends!

10:50.562 --> 10:51.433
One of them's
wearing jeans!

10:51.607 --> 10:53.130
I'll handle this.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.655
Relax! Sports don't matter!

10:55.829 --> 10:58.788
[BOOING ANGRILY]

11:01.138 --> 11:03.880
ADULT ADAM: My brother
couldn't help me fix
my big sports screw-up,

11:04.054 --> 11:05.926
so I had to
step up to the plate
and face the high heat...

11:06.100 --> 11:07.710
Whatever that means.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.451
This is the worst thing
that ever happened
to our school

11:09.625 --> 11:11.583
since the witch burnings.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.324
You're lucky we don't
do that anymore.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.978
Technically,
I'd be a warlock.

11:15.152 --> 11:16.632
That's what they call
male witches.

11:16.806 --> 11:18.416
Just FYI,
if it comes up socially.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.679
When would it come up
socially?

11:19.853 --> 11:21.768
At a Wiccan cocktail party?

11:21.942 --> 11:24.248
Perfect example,
but I'm still furious.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.424
What if we just lob a call
to Germantown Prep
and redo the game?

11:26.598 --> 11:28.252
That's your solution?

11:28.426 --> 11:29.950
Look, I don't want to
overstate this,

11:30.124 --> 11:32.517
but you have killed
our school spirit forever!

11:32.692 --> 11:33.518
I can fix that.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.390
What is spirit anyway

11:35.564 --> 11:36.739
if not something dead
that comes back
to haunt people?

11:36.913 --> 11:37.914
But in a good way.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.655
Stop speaking in tongues,
warlock.

11:39.829 --> 11:42.005
I'll make a new video
of the seniors

11:42.179 --> 11:44.834
sharing their joyful
William Penn experiences.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.009
Why should I give you
another shot?

11:46.183 --> 11:48.185
Because,
like our football team,

11:48.359 --> 11:50.361
you love the story
of an underdog

11:50.535 --> 11:52.624
coming from behind
for a big win.

11:52.799 --> 11:55.584
But if you don't reinvigorate
our student spirit,

11:55.758 --> 11:57.934
I'm calling NYU
and showing them
the pigeon video.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.936
The stakes
are weirdly high.

12:00.110 --> 12:02.809

I set off to win back
my classmates.

exactly happy about.

I was gonna put that
in my hype reel

"Every second
of every day,

12:17.127 --> 12:18.085
"I want to kick you

While my peers rejected me,

12:23.438 --> 12:25.048

for a little help
from her friends.

Okay, Wofsy

the house in your name

over many, many years
at little to no interest.

this is book club.

We're talking about

Well, I would be-love-it
if you would just do it.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.501

how's your credit?Bad.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.982
Then I'm tapped out.
Anyone else?

Why don't you seduce him
with home-cooked meals
and baked goods?

Essie actually
seduces him.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.859
Excuse me, now?

Come on, you're single
and ready to mangle.

Let's fix your hair and makeup
and send you over there.

12:58.473 --> 12:59.604
What's wrong with
my hair and makeup?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.650
Mom, I shouldn't have
to say this again,

13:01.824 --> 13:04.087
but sending your friends
to do adult favors
is no way to get a house.

13:04.261 --> 13:05.306
Do you have any better ideas?

13:05.480 --> 13:06.960
Ooh, write a letter.

That's what my parents did
when they bought their house.

13:09.005 --> 13:11.660
Lou and I wrote a note
that was so moving
and heartfelt

13:11.834 --> 13:14.054
that the nice, old lady
wept in my arms.

13:14.228 --> 13:17.318
Of course.
A heartfelt letter. Oh.
