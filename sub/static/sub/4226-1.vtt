00:04.050 --> 00:06.673
I was in school
when the ships came.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.375
They were really big,

00:08.410 --> 00:10.677
and they said that we
weren't gonna attack them

00:10.712 --> 00:12.146
with the nuclear bombs

00:12.180 --> 00:13.580
because they might have
wanted to be friends.

00:13.615 --> 00:15.249
But they didn't want
to be friends.

00:15.283 --> 00:16.517
Not at all.

00:16.551 --> 00:18.218
And then there
was a bright light

00:18.253 --> 00:20.687
that makes, like,
all electronics stop working.

00:20.722 --> 00:21.688
Computers.

00:21.723 --> 00:23.657
Radios.
Satellites.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.225
Cars.
TVs.

00:25.260 --> 00:26.527
Everything.

00:26.561 --> 00:28.295
They blew up army bases,

00:28.329 --> 00:30.564
ships, the Navy,
submarines,

00:30.598 --> 00:32.665
and all the soldiers are gone.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.035
Now moms and dads
have to fight.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.438
After that, they blew up
all the capitals.

00:37.472 --> 00:39.473
New York, Washington, D.C.,
Paris.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.708
To all the major cities.

00:41.743 --> 00:43.444
Then they came.

00:43.478 --> 00:45.179
There were millions of them.
Trillions.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.246
Everywhere.

00:46.281 --> 00:47.815
We call them
Skitters and Mechs.

00:47.849 --> 00:50.417
They killed grown-ups,
and they catch kids.

00:50.452 --> 00:51.652
They put on harness things.

00:51.686 --> 00:53.587
They put it on kids
and control them.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.355
They say
it hurts a lot.

00:55.390 --> 00:58.091
My parents went out
to get some help one day.

00:58.126 --> 01:00.494
And I know
they're gone. They're dead.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.529
Listen, it's okay to cry.

01:02.564 --> 01:05.732
Drawing and talking about it
can make you feel better.

01:05.767 --> 01:08.268
Matt, what have you
drawn here?

01:08.303 --> 01:09.570
My mom.

01:09.604 --> 01:12.806
She was going to get food once
and never came back.

01:12.841 --> 01:14.775
And then we found her.

01:14.809 --> 01:17.678
She was dead.

01:17.712 --> 01:21.048
And then dad said
we had to leave our house.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.584
And Ben was over
at Nick's house,

01:23.618 --> 01:26.487
and we think
they might have got him.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.522
But we're not for sure.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.224
And this drawing?

01:30.258 --> 01:33.193
That's with me
and dad and Hal.

01:33.228 --> 01:35.028
It's all right.

01:35.063 --> 01:37.331
You and your dad and Hal
are okay.

01:37.365 --> 01:40.167
Well, they were okay
this morning.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.536
But I don't know
about now.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.137
They're fighting.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.479
Go.

01:54.082 --> 01:58.552
Go! Take the gas!

01:58.586 --> 02:00.387
Bryan, Mechs!
Stay down!

02:00.421 --> 02:02.623
Aah!

02:04.859 --> 02:06.493
Get the food.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:34.889 --> 02:37.724
Aah!

02:39.928 --> 02:41.595
Leave it.

02:50.538 --> 02:53.840
Here they come!
Cover them!

02:53.875 --> 02:56.143
Short bursts!
Short bursts!

03:07.589 --> 03:08.989
Ugh!

03:09.023 --> 03:11.024
Aah!

03:12.994 --> 03:16.797
Get up!

03:21.469 --> 03:23.837
Hal, in here.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.105
Ugh.

03:26.975 --> 03:29.476
Skitters.

03:34.616 --> 03:35.616
Aah!

03:41.689 --> 03:42.956
That's Jerrod's cousin.

03:42.991 --> 03:44.257
No. No, don't.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.026
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.728
Shh, shh, shh.

03:49.564 --> 03:53.100
That's Jerrod's cousin.

03:57.839 --> 04:00.574
Come on.
Come on.

04:01.743 --> 04:03.510
Get up!

04:06.948 --> 04:09.282
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:09.317 --> 04:11.251
Mechs -- front.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.654
The Colton Street barricade's down.
Skitters, too.

04:13.688 --> 04:16.690
They're up to the common.
Both barricades there are gone.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.526
We're falling back.
Back Bay is lost.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.161
They take Back Bay,
they take the city.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.397
No kidding.
Porter's calling us in.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.666
Let's go.

04:43.951 --> 04:47.888
South Boston! South Boston!
South Boston!

04:47.922 --> 04:49.322
Quiet.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.591
They got South Boston!
Skitters and Mechs.

04:51.626 --> 04:53.427
Rear guard, come on!

05:16.651 --> 05:18.085
We holding?

05:18.119 --> 05:19.419
Who'd we lose?

05:19.454 --> 05:21.521
Captain Jameson,
Jerrod's cousin,

05:21.556 --> 05:23.490
and a bunch of guys
I didn't know.

05:23.524 --> 05:27.527
Jameson's dead?
Who's gonna command the 2nd?

05:51.819 --> 05:53.687
Excuse me.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.982
You're back
from work early.

06:22.016 --> 06:23.583
Tough day at the office.

06:23.618 --> 06:25.652
We lost
the Widget account.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.788
Oh, rats.

06:27.822 --> 06:28.922
Bad?

06:28.956 --> 06:31.992
Yeah.
They're up to Back Bay.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.329
Any food?

06:38.466 --> 06:40.867
Price of tuna's gone up.

06:40.902 --> 06:43.603
Wait.

06:43.638 --> 06:45.872
Matt drew these.

06:48.142 --> 06:52.245
He's doing much better --
drew his whole family.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.084
That does not
look like me.

06:58.119 --> 07:01.188
Tom, Tom.

07:01.222 --> 07:02.923
Porter wants to see you.

07:06.060 --> 07:08.862
Back Bay was lost.

07:08.896 --> 07:12.232
They let go in South Boston --
one of the big ones.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.735
I told Reed small arms only.
He had those AT4s.

07:15.770 --> 07:18.705
I guess he used them
and pissed them off.

07:21.676 --> 07:22.976
Come on in, Tom.

07:23.010 --> 07:27.681
Gents, the city's lost,
so we're on the move.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.083
We're gonna split up,
go to ground,

07:30.117 --> 07:32.085
where we can hide
and scavenge.

07:33.955 --> 07:35.589
We can't leave the city.

07:35.623 --> 07:38.358
They've got prisoners.
What about the harnessed kids?

07:38.392 --> 07:41.361
Tom, you're not the only guy
with a kid that's M.I.A.

07:41.395 --> 07:43.330
We're all
in this together,

07:43.364 --> 07:45.065
and you've got two other sons
to worry about.

07:45.099 --> 07:46.833
Okay, well, I have to agree
with him there.

07:46.868 --> 07:48.101
We can't leave the city.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.603
We've got no choice.

07:49.637 --> 07:52.539
We picked this area clean
of weapons and food.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.974
And those
skitter aerial sensors

07:54.008 --> 07:55.775
are beginning to pick up units
of 500, 600 humans.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.444
Well, I'll tell you
what we need to do.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.379
We need to stay here,
and we need to fight.

07:59.413 --> 08:00.513
Listen to me, Weaver.

08:00.548 --> 08:04.551
We are splitting up
into units of 300 --

08:04.585 --> 08:08.688
100 fighters,
200 civilians each.

08:08.723 --> 08:11.391
I've already sent out
nine of these units.

08:11.425 --> 08:15.495
You're the last three.

08:15.529 --> 08:18.465
Anderson, I want you to take
the 10th Massachusetts

08:18.499 --> 08:21.001
north along the shore
till you get to Marblehead.

08:21.035 --> 08:24.971
Sam, you got Jeffries
as your second-in-command.

08:25.006 --> 08:30.577
We'll move northwest along
route 3 till you get to Revere.

08:30.611 --> 08:33.280
Weaver.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.082
I'm giving you
the 2nd Massachusetts

08:36.116 --> 08:38.051
to replace Jameson.

08:39.419 --> 08:43.857
I'm also giving you Tom
as your second-in-command.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.927
You move west, go to ground
somewhere around Acton.

08:46.961 --> 08:49.396
What do we do when they start
picking up groups of 300?

08:49.430 --> 08:51.831
Then we break up into smaller
units and we continue, Weaver.

08:51.866 --> 08:54.734
Till it's armies of one and the
start picking us off individually?

08:54.769 --> 08:55.936
Is that how we do it?

08:55.970 --> 08:57.704
Listen, if you've got
a better idea,

08:57.738 --> 08:59.072
I'd damn sure like to hear it.
Oh, I have a better idea.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.340
We got a chance
right now.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.243
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

09:03.277 --> 09:05.512
Now, I don't know how many
Skitters and Mechs the bastards left,

09:05.546 --> 09:07.580
but it's a hell of a lot less
than it was

09:07.615 --> 09:09.449
and a hell of a lot less
than it'll be

09:09.483 --> 09:11.084
when the mother ships come back,
and they will.

09:11.118 --> 09:15.622
We cannot fight these things
unless we know how.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.624
I know how.
No, you don't.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.593
Nobody knows how,
and that's the problem.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.930
That's the reason we're gonna
split up, we're gonna run,

09:23.965 --> 09:27.767
we're gonna hide,
and we're gonna survive.

09:27.802 --> 09:32.939
Now, all the food stores
have been marked on your maps.

09:32.974 --> 09:36.943
As of last week's recon,
they were all intact and secure.

09:36.978 --> 09:40.080
I'm gonna have the med
and science people with me.

09:40.114 --> 09:43.683
They're still working
on the harness situation.

09:43.718 --> 09:45.385
Lost two more kids this morning

09:45.419 --> 09:46.820
trying to get
the damn things off.

09:46.854 --> 09:49.556
Now, that's it.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.524
Any questions?

09:51.559 --> 09:53.560
No, sir.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.562
Get back to your people.
We move out in the morning.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.597
I'll let you know
the exact time.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.806
Jim, I think
you're making a mistake

10:06.841 --> 10:08.875
to give Weaver
noncombatants -- I do.

10:10.544 --> 10:12.779
Listen,
it had to be Weaver.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.648
He's got eight years
active army,

10:15.683 --> 10:16.950
he's got six years reserve,

10:16.984 --> 10:19.052
and I saw him operate
in Desert Storm.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.488
You, on the other hand,
Professor Mason,

10:21.522 --> 10:22.722
have read a lot of books.

10:22.757 --> 10:24.090
Hey, I'm not asking.

10:24.125 --> 10:27.560
Now, I grant you that
a great deal of those books

10:27.595 --> 10:29.796
were military history,
but I had to go with Weaver.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.431
Understood.

10:31.465 --> 10:34.501
There's a reason why you
are his second-in-command.

10:34.535 --> 10:38.438
You do whatever
you've got to do

10:38.472 --> 10:40.573
to defend those civilians.

10:45.079 --> 10:46.479
I understand.

10:46.514 --> 10:47.881
Good.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.649
And good luck.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.851
Yeah.

10:51.886 --> 10:54.220
It's not over, Tom.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.160
Okay, so, these guys

11:00.194 --> 11:02.962
from the 5th Mass, okay,
down in Dorchester --

11:02.997 --> 11:04.998
uh, out of ammo,

11:05.032 --> 11:07.000
except for, what,
these two bullets

11:07.034 --> 11:08.902
in a clip
in an old .45 automatic?

11:08.936 --> 11:10.837
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right?

11:10.871 --> 11:13.606
What then?
Yeah, come on. What happened?

11:13.641 --> 11:14.974
Okay, so, the guy,

11:15.009 --> 11:16.609
you know, he stands there
like bait, right?

11:16.644 --> 11:18.078
Skitter moved in.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.080
Right. Other guy from behind
the dumpster --

11:20.114 --> 11:21.748
boom! Boom!

11:21.782 --> 11:23.516
Head shot,
point-blank range.

11:23.551 --> 11:25.552
You're dead. Dead.

11:25.586 --> 11:26.920
That's one way to do it.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.588
I'd do it like that.

11:28.622 --> 11:30.557
Man, you would
wet yourself.

11:30.591 --> 11:32.592
Fine, long as I get
that head shot in.

11:32.626 --> 11:34.294
All right, man.
All right, man.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.764
What are you
looking at?

11:39.533 --> 11:42.268
That thing hasn't moved
since yesterday.

11:42.303 --> 11:44.437
I was just wondering
how to get at it.

11:45.873 --> 11:48.875
You know, find my way inside,
head upstairs,

11:48.909 --> 11:52.779
find the lizard in charge,
and just kick some alien ass.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.882
Personally,
I like the idea

11:55.916 --> 11:58.618
of seven or eight
truckloads of C-4

11:58.652 --> 12:00.987
driven in simultaneously
from different directions.
Mm-hmm.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.690
Maybe a couple coming in
on boats across the harbor.

12:03.724 --> 12:04.924
Boom.
Yeah.

12:04.959 --> 12:06.559
How do the drivers
get out of there?

12:06.594 --> 12:08.061
No, no, no, no.

12:08.095 --> 12:11.064
You got it all wrong.

12:11.098 --> 12:14.634
Outside of that thing's
gonna be like a fortress.

12:14.668 --> 12:17.537
You need to get inside --
a trojan horse.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.906
Or, like the World War I
sappers,

12:19.940 --> 12:21.441
tunnel underneath it,

12:21.475 --> 12:24.677
plant the biggest pile of TnT
you've ever seen

12:24.712 --> 12:26.279
right under
the center of it.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.615
Or like the Romans at Pontus,
when they were --

12:28.649 --> 12:31.618
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
There you go, Professor.

12:31.652 --> 12:33.086
Professor kick-ass!

12:33.120 --> 12:37.056
Yeah, well, tomorrow,
we kick ass...

12:37.091 --> 12:39.592
Or maybe the day
after tomorrow.

12:39.627 --> 12:40.960
All right, for now,

12:40.995 --> 12:42.295
let's get that .50 squared away,
get some sleep.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.796
We move out in the morning.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.236
Think that'd work --
heading underground?

12:50.271 --> 12:53.907
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, it has throughout history.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.743
Alexander leading
the Macedonians.

12:58.379 --> 13:00.280
What?

13:00.314 --> 13:02.549
I don't know.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.050
You think, dad,

13:04.084 --> 13:05.852
maybe you could, uh, ease up
on the history lessons --

13:05.886 --> 13:08.955
with the guys around,
at least.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.056
Got it.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.759
All right.

13:22.381 --> 13:25.180
Sure, the 250's faster,
but it's just lousy off-road.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.405
Yeah.

13:26.621 --> 13:28.589
Little 175's better
for scouting,

13:28.623 --> 13:30.157
but it's so damn loud.

13:30.191 --> 13:32.526
Well, Scott thinks he can rig up
some sort of muffler for it,

13:32.560 --> 13:35.362
and maybe the --
thought you might be hungry.

13:36.531 --> 13:38.565
Yeah, I was worried
about you.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.768
Oh, really wasn't
that bad.

13:40.802 --> 13:42.536
Glad you're okay.

13:42.570 --> 13:44.338
Yeah.

13:46.007 --> 13:47.941
"I'm glad you're okay."

13:56.551 --> 13:57.818
How long?

13:57.852 --> 13:59.853
Just finishing up.

13:59.888 --> 14:01.773
We got most of the stretcher
cases off already.

14:01.798 --> 14:02.589
You're good.

14:02.590 --> 14:04.725
For a pediatrician.

14:04.759 --> 14:06.794
For any doctor.

14:06.828 --> 14:09.930
Practice makes perfect.

14:09.964 --> 14:12.733
There <i>is</i> a silver lining
in all of this.

14:12.767 --> 14:13.967
Oh, yeah?

14:14.002 --> 14:15.769
If this hadn't happened,

14:15.804 --> 14:19.006
I'd be dealing with flu shots
and neurotic mothers.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.874
I'd be grading midterms...

14:20.909 --> 14:23.777
Or at least staring
at a stack of blue books,

14:23.812 --> 14:25.679
trying to figure out
how to avoid them.

14:25.714 --> 14:28.882
Hey, things
could be worse.

14:28.917 --> 14:31.719
So, what are we doing?
Running? Regrouping?

14:31.753 --> 14:34.488
I just hope Porter knows
what he's doing.

14:34.522 --> 14:38.092
Retreat, regroup,
return...

14:38.126 --> 14:40.260
Revenge.

14:43.832 --> 14:45.399
Forget about
those Shopsmarts.

14:45.433 --> 14:47.668
They're too close in --
traps for sure.

14:47.702 --> 14:49.536
Our best bet is that Sundash
in Belmont.

14:49.571 --> 14:50.738
Yeah, I agree.

14:50.772 --> 14:52.806
You don't have to agree.
You just need to listen.

14:52.841 --> 14:54.508
Those are my orders.
Yes, sir.

15:01.983 --> 15:03.016
Okay, try it again.

15:03.051 --> 15:04.418
You gonna get it going?

15:04.452 --> 15:06.420
Almost there.
I just need to fix the --

15:06.454 --> 15:07.921
You got 10 minutes.

15:07.956 --> 15:10.824
I hated carburetors before
electronic fuel injection,

15:10.859 --> 15:12.793
and I hate carburetors now.
Uncle Scott?

15:12.827 --> 15:15.963
We've got 200 pounds
of medical supplies.

15:15.997 --> 15:18.599
Into the car
or into backpacks?

15:18.633 --> 15:21.502
In the car.
I'll get it going.

15:22.403 --> 15:24.905
Backpacks. Backpacks.

15:24.939 --> 15:26.740
All right, come on,
try it again.

15:34.749 --> 15:36.183
Why are we leaving?

15:36.217 --> 15:38.252
Going someplace better.

15:40.588 --> 15:44.625
But tonight's the 8th.
It's my party.

15:44.659 --> 15:48.495
Oh, sure thing,
your highness.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.130
Hey, you had
a birthday party, too,

15:50.165 --> 15:53.000
and it was
after they came.

15:53.034 --> 15:55.002
We'll try to do a little
something when we get settled.

15:55.036 --> 15:57.371
We're doing the best
that we can.

16:03.144 --> 16:05.045
Hey.

16:06.314 --> 16:07.614
Give him a break,
all right?

16:39.681 --> 16:42.249
Okay, load them up.

17:16.351 --> 17:18.886
What?

17:18.920 --> 17:20.153
I know that house.

17:20.188 --> 17:22.122
My husband has a piece
hanging there.

17:22.156 --> 17:24.156
Painting?
A landscape.

17:24.192 --> 17:27.361
One of my patients --
rich tech guy -- lived there.

17:27.395 --> 17:29.796
To seal the sale, my husband
and I had dinner with them.

17:29.831 --> 17:32.633
I remember going out
that evening,

17:32.667 --> 17:34.868
and, uh,
my son was crying.

17:34.903 --> 17:37.004
He was 3.

17:37.038 --> 17:40.007
You know where we are?

17:40.041 --> 17:41.808
This is Bartlett Hill.

17:41.843 --> 17:46.146
About 400 years ago, this was
all Pennacook settlement.

17:46.180 --> 17:50.150
Smallpox wiped them out.

17:50.184 --> 17:52.319
Ever the history Professor.

17:53.788 --> 17:55.856
Yeah, fat lot of good
tenure got me.

17:58.092 --> 18:02.129
Oh, I wonder what will be here
in another 400 years.

18:02.163 --> 18:04.164
Hopefully humans.

18:23.415 --> 18:25.049
I wish more food.

18:28.539 --> 18:29.973
Dad.

18:30.007 --> 18:31.207
Every food store and cache

18:31.242 --> 18:34.177
between here and Acton's
picked clean.

18:38.048 --> 18:40.116
Too many of us.

18:40.150 --> 18:41.351
If it was
just the fighters,

18:41.385 --> 18:42.885
we could stretch
our provisions.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.287
Well, it's not,
and we need food.

18:44.321 --> 18:46.623
So it's one
of the Shopsmarts, then --

18:46.657 --> 18:48.124
either the store
in West Newton

18:48.158 --> 18:50.593
or the distribution center
in Watertown.

18:52.596 --> 18:56.266
We can't go back,
not with this group --

18:56.300 --> 19:00.370
too many, too slow.

19:02.172 --> 19:04.607
Maybe half the vehicles,
half the fighters go back,

19:04.642 --> 19:06.042
get the food,
and then they catch up?

19:06.076 --> 19:08.111
Yeah.
That sounds great.

19:08.145 --> 19:10.113
Who's gonna
lead them -- you?

19:12.483 --> 19:14.217
Yes.

19:17.288 --> 19:19.188
You want to go back?

19:19.223 --> 19:21.090
Yes.

19:25.195 --> 19:27.363
All right.

19:27.398 --> 19:30.033
But I can only give you
the pickup and six fighters.

19:32.403 --> 19:33.148
Weapons?

19:33.173 --> 19:34.785
What you got and as many mags
as you can carry.

19:34.786 --> 19:37.621
One of the RPGs?
No.

19:37.655 --> 19:39.023
Some C-4?
No.

19:39.057 --> 19:41.825
All right,
we'll make do!

19:41.860 --> 19:43.894
All right!

19:43.928 --> 19:47.698
The rest of us will follow
the commuter rail west!

19:47.732 --> 19:48.899
We'll meet
at the Littleton Bridge!

19:48.933 --> 19:50.567
Pick your squad!
Good luck!

19:54.172 --> 19:56.573
Are you sure about this?

20:01.112 --> 20:02.346
Take care of Matt.

20:02.380 --> 20:04.748
- I will.
- You need a scout?

20:04.783 --> 20:07.017
I want you to stay with the group.
You to stay with Matt.

20:07.052 --> 20:09.820
Weaver's more likely to get me
killed than you are.

20:09.854 --> 20:11.522
You need two scouts!

20:13.391 --> 20:15.059
Yes, I do.

20:15.093 --> 20:17.227
Why don't you find Dai and Click
and Anthony and one other,

20:17.262 --> 20:19.063
see if they'll volunteer?

20:19.097 --> 20:20.464
You go with her.

20:27.772 --> 20:29.239
Thomas.

20:33.311 --> 20:36.313
Dai, you in?

20:36.347 --> 20:37.514
Yep.

20:37.549 --> 20:40.651
Weaver's keeping
all the heavy stuff.

20:40.685 --> 20:43.253
Is that right?

20:43.288 --> 20:47.791
C-4? Where --
where did you get this?

20:50.595 --> 20:51.962
Thanks.

20:55.467 --> 20:58.235
So, you think there will be
a lot of them?

21:03.608 --> 21:05.175
Come on, Jimmy.

21:05.210 --> 21:06.343
Anthony, I need --

21:06.377 --> 21:08.645
7.62. I need a mag.
You got?

21:08.680 --> 21:10.914
I got. Here.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.187
This could be fun.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.390
You'll be there, right?

21:20.425 --> 21:22.025
Will you give
this party thing a rest?

21:22.060 --> 21:24.161
Yeah, I'm gonna try
to be there.

21:24.195 --> 21:26.396
I already know
what I'm gonna wish for.

21:26.431 --> 21:27.598
Oh, yeah? What?

21:27.632 --> 21:28.999
Well, I can't tell you.

21:29.033 --> 21:31.168
Sure you can.
I'm your father.

21:31.202 --> 21:32.936
It's rule 619.
You can tell me anything.

21:32.971 --> 21:34.705
Hand me that sleeping bag,
would you?

21:36.641 --> 21:38.609
Are you sure?
Of course.

21:38.643 --> 21:41.178
How else you think you're gonna
get what you ask for?

21:43.148 --> 21:46.984
Well, I wish everything was
just back the way it was --

21:47.018 --> 21:51.221
our house, my bike, school,
my ripstik,

21:51.256 --> 21:54.057
and Ben...and mom.

21:54.092 --> 21:56.527
I thought
you didn't like school.

21:56.561 --> 21:58.128
Well, I like it now.

21:58.163 --> 22:01.365
Dad, I just want everything
back the way it was.

22:01.399 --> 22:04.368
Come here.

22:06.538 --> 22:08.772
So do I.

22:08.806 --> 22:10.874
So do I.

22:14.712 --> 22:16.880
It's gonna get better.

22:32.430 --> 22:34.364
So slow.

22:36.134 --> 22:38.335
Faster than you,
up here.

22:38.369 --> 22:40.270
Dream on.

22:42.307 --> 22:43.407
Catch you later.

22:43.441 --> 22:45.342
Okay.
See you later.

22:45.376 --> 22:46.443
Thanks.

22:46.477 --> 22:48.011
Hang in there,
old man.

22:48.046 --> 22:51.248
We think there's food
here and here.

22:51.282 --> 22:52.683
There's a store in West Newton

22:52.717 --> 22:54.618
and a food distribution
warehouse in Watertown.

22:54.652 --> 22:56.119
They're both Shopsmarts.

22:56.154 --> 22:57.788
If there's food in them,
they're probably traps.

22:57.822 --> 22:59.423
The main invader force

22:59.457 --> 23:01.458
is either gonna come up
River Road or Blanchard Road.

23:01.492 --> 23:02.993
We need to know which one.

23:03.027 --> 23:05.395
I don't want a bunch of Skitters
and Mechs coming up behind us.

23:05.430 --> 23:07.264
So, Hal and Karen, you guys got
to check that out.

23:07.298 --> 23:08.446
You got to let us know
which way they're coming...

23:08.471 --> 23:09.399
Mm-hmm.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.435
...So we know
where to go.

23:11.469 --> 23:13.670
And we'll be waiting
at the train station.

23:13.705 --> 23:15.405
Got it.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.607
Hey, Hal.

23:18.142 --> 23:20.310
Do you, uh...

23:20.345 --> 23:22.646
Need any more
hollow nose?

23:22.680 --> 23:23.914
Hollow point?

23:23.948 --> 23:26.083
Yeah,
that's what I meant.

23:26.117 --> 23:27.551
Uh, yeah, I could use
an extra clip.

23:27.585 --> 23:29.086
Mag?

23:30.188 --> 23:32.155
Yeah,
that's what I meant.

23:32.190 --> 23:35.292
What?

23:35.326 --> 23:37.961
Just remembering.

23:37.996 --> 23:39.896
What was it --
seven, eight months ago,

23:39.931 --> 23:42.132
you wouldn't let me ride my bike
over to Julien's at night

23:42.166 --> 23:44.434
'cause I didn't have
a bike light.

23:44.469 --> 23:48.005
Now you're offering me
extra ammo.

23:48.039 --> 23:49.306
Things change.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.074
Yeah.

23:51.109 --> 23:53.810
Uh...some things don't.

24:06.024 --> 24:07.991
Be safe.

24:08.026 --> 24:09.192
Yeah, you too.

25:57.182 --> 26:00.051
Somebody tried
to take it off of him.

26:00.085 --> 26:02.020
Killed him.

26:02.054 --> 26:04.756
He's about the same age
as Ben...

26:07.526 --> 26:09.560
...My son.

27:16.962 --> 27:18.696
Ben?

27:30.576 --> 27:33.010
Ben?

27:43.522 --> 27:44.889
Which way
are they coming?

27:44.923 --> 27:47.024
Ben's alive.
I saw him.

27:47.059 --> 27:48.126
I saw him.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.127
What?

27:49.161 --> 27:50.761
He's harnessed,
but he's alive.

27:50.796 --> 27:53.431
Are you sure
it was him?

27:53.465 --> 27:55.133
Dad, he's alive.

27:55.167 --> 27:56.534
Come on,
we got to go get him.

27:56.568 --> 27:57.969
All right, we'll screw
this food thing.

27:58.003 --> 27:59.470
We got to go get him
right now.

27:59.505 --> 28:00.771
Whoa.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:00.806 --> 28:02.740
Dad, it's Ben.
We got to go get him.

28:02.774 --> 28:03.975
I'm in.
Me too.

28:04.009 --> 28:05.343
How many Skitters?
How many Mechs?

28:05.377 --> 28:06.844
There's like half a dozen
in front

28:06.879 --> 28:08.646
with Ben
and the other harnessed kids.

28:08.680 --> 28:09.814
And more coming up
after them.

28:09.848 --> 28:10.948
You said
hundreds in airships.

28:10.983 --> 28:12.550
Who cares?

28:12.584 --> 28:13.651
All right? It's Ben.

28:13.685 --> 28:14.852
I'm there. Let's go.

28:14.887 --> 28:17.955
No, it's too many.
That's way too many.

28:19.491 --> 28:21.392
No, no. We got -- we got
to stick to the mission.

28:21.426 --> 28:23.094
We got to take the food
to the group,

28:23.128 --> 28:24.562
and then I'll get Ben.

28:24.596 --> 28:26.797
No. I'm going to get him
right now with or without you.

28:26.832 --> 28:28.966
No. Hal!

28:29.001 --> 28:30.968
Hey, no.

28:31.003 --> 28:32.637
Get off. Let go of me!

28:39.011 --> 28:41.612
You think I don't want
to go get him right now?

28:41.647 --> 28:44.348
He's my son!
And you're my son!

28:44.383 --> 28:46.150
And Matt is
back there alone!

28:46.185 --> 28:47.451
Aah!

28:47.486 --> 28:48.886
Do you think I want him
to hear

28:48.921 --> 28:50.721
he's lost his other brother
and his father?

28:50.756 --> 28:54.058
We do this the right way,
or we all die!

28:56.094 --> 28:58.896
We get the food,
we bring it to the group,

28:58.931 --> 29:01.799
and then we'll get Ben --

29:01.833 --> 29:03.834
together, you and me.

29:10.709 --> 29:14.145
All right.
We'll do it your way.

29:24.189 --> 29:26.224
Which way
are they coming?

29:26.258 --> 29:27.925
Blanchard.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.361
That's the Watertown Shopsmart.
I know it.

29:30.395 --> 29:32.496
Click, grab that box.

29:37.402 --> 29:38.936
That's the building.

29:38.971 --> 29:41.739
There's a road here.
There's a road here.

29:41.773 --> 29:44.075
We're gonna do our recon
from here.

29:44.109 --> 29:45.409
We'll wait till it gets dark.

29:45.444 --> 29:48.846
Then I go in first
with Dai...and Hal.

29:48.880 --> 29:51.115
If it's clear,
then you guys come in,

29:51.149 --> 29:53.117
we get the food, we get
the hell out of there.

29:53.151 --> 29:54.252
If it's not clear?

29:54.286 --> 29:55.820
If it's not clear,
if it goes bad,

29:55.854 --> 29:57.255
then I want you guys
to take off

29:57.289 --> 29:58.522
at the sound
of the first shot.

29:58.557 --> 30:00.324
Don't wait for us.
You go, and you go fast.

30:00.359 --> 30:03.661
Take the bikes, you take the truck,
and you go to Upland Park.

30:03.695 --> 30:05.062
And go
to the Littleton Bridge.

30:05.097 --> 30:06.697
But w-what
if it's a trap?

30:06.732 --> 30:08.666
Well, we'll see.
Dover was.

30:08.700 --> 30:09.967
That was a Skitter
and two Mechs.

30:10.002 --> 30:11.702
The grocery store in J.P.

30:11.737 --> 30:13.971
Had three Mechs
and two Skitters.

30:14.006 --> 30:15.473
We're never gonna beat them,
are we?

30:15.507 --> 30:18.242
They die, just like us.

30:18.277 --> 30:20.378
Just got to get close.

30:20.412 --> 30:22.179
Listen, I know
that you're scared

30:22.214 --> 30:23.814
and I know it doesn't seem
like it, but we can beat them.

30:23.849 --> 30:25.249
We don't have
to kill them all.

30:25.284 --> 30:27.051
We just got
to kill enough of them.

30:27.085 --> 30:28.653
If we can make it too costly,

30:28.687 --> 30:30.354
too painful for them to stay,
then they'll leave.

30:30.389 --> 30:32.189
They're wolves.
We got to be porcupines.

30:32.224 --> 30:33.891
If we can hurt them,
they'll leave.

30:33.925 --> 30:35.192
It hasn't worked so far.

30:35.227 --> 30:37.161
Well, it will,
'cause it has before.

30:37.195 --> 30:39.430
History is full
of inferior forces

30:39.464 --> 30:43.167
creating so much trouble
that the invading army leaves --

30:43.201 --> 30:45.269
the Athenians at Marathon,

30:45.304 --> 30:49.307
the, uh, Scots against
the British at Stirling Bridge,

30:49.341 --> 30:51.676
and our revolution
fought right here...

30:55.347 --> 30:57.381
...Red Sox/Yankees, '04.

31:01.153 --> 31:02.486
We can beat them.

32:25.599 --> 32:27.634
All right, Anthony, you and
Jimmy guard this entrance,

32:27.668 --> 32:28.935
load the food
as it comes in.

32:28.969 --> 32:30.603
You guys come with me.
Karen, grab that cart.

32:30.638 --> 32:32.072
Okay.
Come on.

32:32.106 --> 32:34.808
We can do this.
We'll be all right.

32:39.747 --> 32:41.047
Go.

32:47.355 --> 32:50.123
Got it? Here.

33:11.912 --> 33:13.179
Ugh!

33:22.523 --> 33:25.325
Hal,
get out of there!

35:25.610 --> 35:27.410
I wonder
what it's thinking.

35:33.070 --> 35:34.503
Nothing now.

35:38.609 --> 35:41.143
Let's go.

35:48.185 --> 35:50.786
They're back!

36:20.550 --> 36:22.518
Thank you.

36:37.234 --> 36:39.368
Well, what took you
so long?

36:41.071 --> 36:42.271
How much did you get?

36:42.305 --> 36:43.606
A truckload,
enough for a few days.

36:43.640 --> 36:44.573
Hmm.

36:44.608 --> 36:47.076
Hal,
why don't you stay?

36:47.110 --> 36:48.711
You guys wait outside.

36:52.482 --> 36:55.017
My son Ben is alive.

36:55.052 --> 36:57.987
What?
Hal saw him.

36:58.021 --> 36:59.588
Did he?

37:02.626 --> 37:03.887
We're not going back.

37:03.912 --> 37:05.512
Our next objective
is the Acton Armory.

37:05.529 --> 37:08.464
I know.

37:08.498 --> 37:11.067
And after we take
the Acton Armory,

37:11.101 --> 37:14.136
I'm gonna be weaponing up
and going back to get him.

37:14.171 --> 37:15.204
So am I.

37:15.238 --> 37:17.840
Are you?

37:17.874 --> 37:20.076
Well, I'm your
commanding officer.

37:20.110 --> 37:24.180
And we're not going back.
<i>You're</i> not going back.

37:31.354 --> 37:33.355
What would you do
if you had the chance

37:33.390 --> 37:34.690
to get your kids back?

37:38.195 --> 37:41.130
He's my son.

37:43.867 --> 37:47.670
You'll never kill enough of them
to get him back.

37:47.704 --> 37:51.974
They die, just like us.

37:52.008 --> 37:55.611
You just have
to get...close.

38:06.022 --> 38:09.158
So, you got to make a wish
and blow it out quick,

38:09.192 --> 38:11.260
'cause it burns out fast.

38:16.600 --> 38:18.234
You know what the wish is.

38:18.268 --> 38:20.536
You sure that's okay?

38:20.570 --> 38:23.172
Yeah.

38:26.443 --> 38:30.012
Yay.
Happy Birthday.

38:30.046 --> 38:31.447
It's all yours.

38:36.419 --> 38:39.255
Matt, I'm sorry.
I don't have anything.

38:39.289 --> 38:41.357
Dad, what's the matter
with you?

38:41.391 --> 38:42.992
What?

38:43.026 --> 38:47.029
You forgot the thing --
the thing we got for him.

38:47.063 --> 38:48.397
You're going senile.

38:48.431 --> 38:50.199
It's from dad.

38:57.073 --> 38:58.641
I know what this is.

39:00.510 --> 39:01.744
A ripstik.

39:13.557 --> 39:16.559
Ride, fool.
We only got 10 minutes.

40:26.997 --> 40:28.163
All right.

40:31.534 --> 40:32.801
It's time to go!

40:32.836 --> 40:36.305
All right!
We're moving out.

40:36.339 --> 40:39.642
I want to make the great meadow
by dark.

40:39.676 --> 40:42.211
We're gonna set up camp there.

40:42.245 --> 40:44.146
There's good cover there.

40:44.180 --> 40:47.249
Karen, you're forward.
Hal, you flank.

40:49.286 --> 40:51.620
Let's go.

41:27.483 --> 41:30.983

41:38.583 --> 41:40.417
Mech tracks.

41:40.451 --> 41:43.086
Armory could be a trap.

41:43.121 --> 41:44.921
Those weapons
better be worth it.

41:44.956 --> 41:48.058
It's about six hours old.
That's when the rain stopped.

41:48.092 --> 41:50.293
Those ones are empty.

41:57.368 --> 41:59.102
Okay,
who's got the ball?

41:59.137 --> 42:01.004
Right here.

42:03.374 --> 42:07.244
Think you can get it that far,
old man?

42:07.278 --> 42:10.514
$5 million says you can't hit
the front steps.

42:12.483 --> 42:15.385
You make that a stick of gum,
we got a bet.

42:15.419 --> 42:18.054
All right, buddy, you ready?
Ready for this?

42:40.044 --> 42:43.413
Nemo, come back!

42:58.062 --> 43:00.263
Go, go, go!

43:24.855 --> 43:26.723
Matty.

43:28.726 --> 43:30.927
It's time to get up.

43:35.766 --> 43:39.135
If I see him, I'll let you know.
I'm sorry.

43:43.007 --> 43:44.641
What was that?

43:44.675 --> 43:46.743
Word's out I saw harnessed kids
before we hit the Shopsmart.

43:46.777 --> 43:48.745
They want to know
if I saw their kid.

43:52.550 --> 43:55.485
Aw, man.
Oatmeal again?

43:55.519 --> 43:57.587
We passed a Denny's.
Maybe you can get a grand slam.

43:57.622 --> 43:58.955
Bite me.

43:58.990 --> 44:00.223
Not much of a morning person,
are you, Matthew?

44:00.248 --> 44:01.448
Come on, you go get in line.

44:01.792 --> 44:05.061
I'll catch up to you.
I have to go report in.

44:05.096 --> 44:06.429
You gonna go look
for Ben tonight?

44:06.464 --> 44:07.664
That's the plan.

44:07.698 --> 44:10.600
I found some sticks
in the basement.

44:10.635 --> 44:11.901
Want to play catch later?

44:11.936 --> 44:14.004
After school?

44:17.275 --> 44:19.409
No sign
of any Skitters,

44:19.443 --> 44:22.545
but wherever there's
a Mech...

44:22.580 --> 44:23.847
Weapons inside?

44:23.881 --> 44:25.548
Didn't go in.

44:25.583 --> 44:27.651
Didn't feel it was worth taking
it on and attracting Skitters.

44:27.685 --> 44:29.319
You were to be discreet.

44:29.353 --> 44:31.755
Well, we had a little breakdown
in discipline.

44:31.789 --> 44:33.023
We drew fire.

44:33.057 --> 44:34.724
Who?

44:34.759 --> 44:35.859
Jimmy.

44:35.893 --> 44:38.595
He's a good fighter.

44:38.629 --> 44:40.630
13 years old.

44:42.967 --> 44:45.969
Go back tonight.
Find out for sure.

44:46.003 --> 44:48.004
No, our agreement was that
we would be going after Ben

44:48.039 --> 44:49.372
once we scouted
the armory.

44:49.407 --> 44:50.740
Which you haven't done.

44:50.775 --> 44:52.208
You're right.

44:52.243 --> 44:53.810
That said, just like
the food stores

44:53.844 --> 44:55.545
and the pharmacies
that we've seen,

44:55.579 --> 44:58.248
it's probably empty, and the Skitters
are just staking it out.

44:58.282 --> 44:59.916
And you're probably right,
but we need to know.

44:59.950 --> 45:01.418
Hey, this isn't
what we talked about.

45:01.452 --> 45:02.986
You find a better place
to make camp?

45:03.020 --> 45:04.421
I scouted City Hall.

45:04.455 --> 45:05.689
Too many windows,
buildings all around.

45:05.723 --> 45:07.424
I saw a factory
on the edge of town

45:07.458 --> 45:08.725
might work, though.

45:08.759 --> 45:10.827
I'm guessing you didn't see
any harnessed kids.

45:10.861 --> 45:12.796
You know
how much I want to.

45:12.830 --> 45:15.865
All right, let's go.
Come show me on the map.

45:15.900 --> 45:18.268
Captain Weaver.

45:18.302 --> 45:19.703
Dr. Glass.

45:19.737 --> 45:20.904
Couldn't help but notice

45:20.938 --> 45:22.372
all your people are
sleeping in houses

45:22.406 --> 45:23.873
while the rest of us
are in tents.

45:23.908 --> 45:27.110
My fighters need the best sleep
they can get,

45:27.144 --> 45:28.945
and we need to be able
to get the civilians

45:28.979 --> 45:30.547
out of here fast
in case of attack --

45:30.581 --> 45:32.415
wouldn't be feasible
if everyone was in houses.

45:32.450 --> 45:33.950
Well, maybe we take
a few houses

45:33.984 --> 45:35.652
and rotate
some people through.

45:35.686 --> 45:37.320
What, are you
their leader now?

45:37.355 --> 45:40.256
There's no leader.

45:40.291 --> 45:42.659
I'm a doctor,
and doctors hear things.

45:42.693 --> 45:45.428
Well, doctor,
you tell your patients

45:45.463 --> 45:47.831
that if they're dissatisfied,
they're free to leave.

45:47.865 --> 45:49.999
If they want the protection
of my soldiers,

45:50.034 --> 45:52.836
they can minimize the whining
and be grateful for the oatmeal.

45:52.870 --> 45:55.171
They're not just eaters.

45:55.206 --> 45:57.474
They know that's what your soldiers
say about them sometimes --

45:57.508 --> 45:58.641
they're eaters.

45:58.676 --> 46:00.877
They contribute
to the fight.

46:00.911 --> 46:04.514
They cook. They fix clothing.
They haul trash.

46:04.548 --> 46:07.951
Dr. Glass,
a few years from now,

46:07.985 --> 46:09.786
when the Skitters
have been wiped out

46:09.820 --> 46:13.690
or sent back to
the undoubtedly hideous planet

46:13.724 --> 46:15.325
that they call home,

46:15.359 --> 46:18.661
the concerns of the civilians
will be addressed.

46:18.696 --> 46:21.798
Until then,
there's no time for this.

46:25.503 --> 46:28.438
Dear lord.

46:30.941 --> 46:33.977
I did not come here
to get in an argument.

46:36.480 --> 46:37.914
Uncle Scott wants
a word with you.

46:37.948 --> 46:39.449
He has some thoughts
on the aliens

46:39.483 --> 46:40.784
he thought
might be useful.

46:40.818 --> 46:43.787
Happy to talk to him
after I get a little food.

46:47.792 --> 46:51.161
Oh, what I wouldn't give
for an egg...

46:51.195 --> 46:55.265
Some bacon...
A hash brown.

46:55.299 --> 46:57.600
White or wheat?

46:57.635 --> 46:59.569
English muffin,
fork-split,

46:59.603 --> 47:01.905
with enough butter
that would make

47:01.939 --> 47:04.941
a doctor such as yourself
worry about my heart.

47:04.975 --> 47:07.277
Ha!

47:07.311 --> 47:09.946
You know, you never gave
your opinion.

47:09.980 --> 47:11.648
On?

47:11.682 --> 47:13.750
The rights
of the civilians.

47:13.784 --> 47:15.919
I don't think I've ever been
to Acton before.

47:15.953 --> 47:17.787
It's a nice town.

47:19.290 --> 47:21.891
Civilians versus the military --
it's an age-old question.

47:21.926 --> 47:24.694
What side
do you come down on?

47:26.597 --> 47:29.499
I think civilians are
a liability and a hindrance.

47:32.036 --> 47:33.570
And I also feel

47:33.604 --> 47:35.738
that they're the best motivation
we have to fight.

47:37.007 --> 47:38.475
No!

47:38.509 --> 47:39.876
This way!

47:39.910 --> 47:41.878
Just kick it!

47:41.912 --> 47:43.313
Kick it! Yeah!

47:43.347 --> 47:44.981
Come on!
Come on, guys!

47:46.750 --> 47:47.817
Here you go.

47:49.587 --> 47:50.987
Biology.

47:51.021 --> 47:52.555
Biology.

47:52.590 --> 47:55.291
Biology, biology --

47:55.326 --> 47:58.561
it's from a Greek word
meaning "Life discourse."

47:58.596 --> 48:01.464
That's from the dictionary.
But you know what it is to me?

48:01.499 --> 48:06.703
To me, it is the study
of the most miraculous gift

48:06.737 --> 48:09.606
that has ever been bestowed
on us.

48:09.640 --> 48:15.411
It is the study of the wonder
and the beauty and the mystery

48:15.446 --> 48:16.579
that is life itself,

48:16.614 --> 48:18.948
and to study it is to --

48:18.983 --> 48:20.850
well, is to learn humility

48:20.885 --> 48:25.788
and responsibility
and gratitude, right?

48:25.823 --> 48:28.157
Yeah, Matt?

48:28.192 --> 48:30.293
We're not grateful
for Skitters.

48:30.327 --> 48:34.497
No. No, we are not grateful
for Skitters, right?

48:34.532 --> 48:39.302
And we're not grateful for
parasites or cancer, either.

48:39.336 --> 48:40.770
But they are part of life,

48:40.804 --> 48:43.473
and we're grateful for the
chance to study them, right?

48:43.507 --> 48:45.775
And hopefully by studying them,
we'll be able

48:45.809 --> 48:49.913
to better figure out
how to kill them, right?

48:49.947 --> 48:50.947
Right?

48:50.981 --> 48:52.649
Yep.
You bet.

48:54.652 --> 48:56.886
I had a class of,
uh -- of older kids,

48:56.921 --> 48:59.389
and I had them brainstorming
about the aliens.

48:59.423 --> 49:01.457
And they came up
with mostly, you know,

49:01.492 --> 49:03.326
the stuff that we
all talked about --

49:03.360 --> 49:05.528
that the Skitters
must come from a planet

49:05.563 --> 49:07.330
similar to ours, and...
Mm-hmm.

49:07.364 --> 49:09.499
...That they have a wide range
of temperature tolerance.

49:09.533 --> 49:10.767
Anyway,
this one girl came up

49:10.801 --> 49:12.535
with something
that made me think.

49:12.570 --> 49:14.837
She said, you know, whenever
we've dreamed up robots,

49:14.872 --> 49:16.806
we've always imagined them
to sort of be

49:16.840 --> 49:18.107
basically like ourselves --

49:18.142 --> 49:20.743
a head,
two arms, two legs.

49:20.778 --> 49:23.713
But the Skitters
have six legs.

49:23.747 --> 49:26.182
And yet, their robots,
the Mechs, are bipedal.

49:26.216 --> 49:27.750
Now, why wouldn't
they build robots

49:27.785 --> 49:29.485
that look like themselves,
you know?

49:29.520 --> 49:30.853
Well, chances are

49:30.888 --> 49:33.590
they've been studying the Earth
for a while.

49:33.624 --> 49:35.558
Maybe they built Mechs
that way

49:35.593 --> 49:38.294
to have a bigger
psychological impact on us.

49:38.329 --> 49:40.296
Maybe, huh?

49:40.331 --> 49:42.298
Hey, Hal.

49:42.333 --> 49:44.000
Those harnessed kids
you saw the other day --

49:44.034 --> 49:45.568
they were headed west?

49:45.603 --> 49:47.537
Yeah, but they may have changed
direction after I saw them.

49:47.571 --> 49:52.208
Hey, you, uh, never asked
if I saw your son.

49:52.242 --> 49:54.277
I figured you'd tell me
if you had.

49:54.311 --> 49:55.745
After I saw Ben, you know,
I just --

49:55.779 --> 49:57.113
I didn't see
anything else.

49:57.147 --> 49:58.948
We'll be going out tonight.
I'll be looking for him.

49:58.983 --> 50:00.883
Well, when you go,
I'd like to go with you.

50:00.918 --> 50:02.518
All right.

50:03.654 --> 50:04.754
Hey,
do you need a hand?

50:04.788 --> 50:05.989
I got it, but thanks.
Okay.

50:06.023 --> 50:07.390
You could take mine.

50:07.424 --> 50:08.691
Uh, oh. Okay.

50:08.726 --> 50:10.326
She's kidding.
I am?

50:10.361 --> 50:12.462
You are. Right?

50:12.496 --> 50:13.896
O-okay.

50:13.931 --> 50:15.698
Um...

50:15.733 --> 50:19.369
Hey, I saw you walk in
past the outpost sentries.

50:19.403 --> 50:20.603
You looked tired.

50:20.638 --> 50:22.672
What were you doing
by the outpost?

50:22.706 --> 50:25.174
I was in the church
on the corner, praying.

50:25.209 --> 50:27.744
It's episcopalian, not catholic,
but it's close.

50:27.778 --> 50:30.480
I wonder if the Skitters
have a God.

50:30.514 --> 50:33.416
I-I know a lot of people
have lost their faith,

50:33.450 --> 50:35.518
but mine is stronger
than ever.

50:35.552 --> 50:36.853
Good for you.

50:36.887 --> 50:38.855
The next time you get
on your knees and pray,

50:38.889 --> 50:40.890
could you see
if the big guy might get us

50:40.924 --> 50:43.192
an operational B-2 bomber
loaded with nukes?

50:43.227 --> 50:45.728
I don't pray for God
to give me things.

50:45.763 --> 50:48.331
I don't think
that's how it works.

50:48.365 --> 50:49.732
Then what do
you pray for?

50:49.767 --> 50:53.736
I ask God to show me
what I could do for him.

51:03.847 --> 51:06.282
Wonder who she was --

51:06.316 --> 51:08.685
girl who lived here.

51:08.719 --> 51:11.988
Well, maybe she's
still alive.

51:18.829 --> 51:21.464
She liked
"Harry Potter."

51:21.498 --> 51:24.267
Dad used to read these
to me.

51:24.301 --> 51:27.870
I'd always fall asleep.

51:27.905 --> 51:29.806
He read them all to Ben.

51:29.840 --> 51:32.775
Lucky Ben.

51:32.810 --> 51:35.378
Maybe Lourdes
could read them to you.

51:35.412 --> 51:37.380
Oh, for --
she's just being nice.

51:37.414 --> 51:39.549
She's just trying to get
in your shorts.

51:39.583 --> 51:41.284
Karen.
Oh, don't play dumb.

51:41.318 --> 51:43.453
I'm sure you had
plenty of experience

51:43.487 --> 51:45.722
with the female admirers
back at school.

51:45.756 --> 51:46.923
I played lacrosse.

51:46.957 --> 51:49.559
Football players
got the groupies.

51:49.593 --> 51:53.563
Hey, you know there's
no competition, right?

51:55.065 --> 51:56.532
Hal, change of plans.

51:56.567 --> 51:57.900
Whoa!

51:57.935 --> 51:59.469
Uh, get a room.

51:59.503 --> 52:01.404
We got a room.
Could you knock?

52:02.940 --> 52:04.340
Just wanted
to let you know

52:04.374 --> 52:05.875
we're going back
to the armory tonight.

52:06.643 --> 52:08.244
We're going to look
for Ben.

52:08.278 --> 52:09.879
Weaver wants us
to make sure

52:09.913 --> 52:11.848
that there's
no weapons there.

52:11.882 --> 52:14.183
There aren't any.
They're using it as bait.

52:14.218 --> 52:17.520
We're gonna go
make sure.

52:17.554 --> 52:20.156
We'll get Ben
tomorrow night.

52:20.190 --> 52:21.691
Well, I'll go with you
when you do.

52:21.725 --> 52:24.527
- Me too!
- Count me in!

52:24.561 --> 52:27.430
Thin walls.

52:27.464 --> 52:30.600
I guess everybody
hears everything.

52:41.278 --> 52:43.913
We'll find him.

52:43.947 --> 52:46.048
Yeah.

52:51.722 --> 52:53.222
All right.

52:53.257 --> 52:55.792
Jimmy, come here
a second.

52:57.394 --> 52:59.729
You're gonna sit this one out,
all right?

52:59.763 --> 53:01.831
Because I screwed up?

53:01.865 --> 53:04.634
Tom needs someone bigger
in case they find weapons.

53:04.668 --> 53:06.402
That'll be me.
Okay?

53:06.436 --> 53:08.504
Good.
Get some rest.

53:08.539 --> 53:10.673
All right.
We ready?

53:17.815 --> 53:20.750
You're a good soldier,
Jimmy.

53:57.287 --> 53:58.354
Lights out!

53:58.388 --> 54:00.857
What the hell?
Is it Skitters?

54:06.797 --> 54:09.899
Not gonna die.
Not gonna die, hear?

54:11.068 --> 54:14.036
Oh! Oh, Johnny, man,
I've been hit, buddy.

54:14.071 --> 54:16.205
I've been hit, bro.
What the hell happened?

54:16.240 --> 54:18.007
What do you think happened?
I've been shot!

54:18.041 --> 54:20.176
'Cause you shot first!
No, I didn't. I didn't.

54:20.210 --> 54:22.511
Shut up! We're supposed
to do this on the quiet.

54:22.546 --> 54:23.713
I <i>was</i> quiet!

54:23.747 --> 54:25.481
Shut up a second!

54:25.515 --> 54:28.384
There's no way the robot
didn't hear that gunfire.

54:28.418 --> 54:30.152
What do you want?

54:30.187 --> 54:34.757
Well...You...
And your guns.

54:36.660 --> 54:38.561
Listen.
You hear that?

54:38.595 --> 54:43.466
Now, you start firing,
robot comes in,

54:43.500 --> 54:45.701
whereas
you don't do what we say,

54:45.736 --> 54:48.738
we will start picking you off
without so much as a whisper.

54:48.772 --> 54:50.506
So you have a choice.

54:50.540 --> 54:54.210
Put down your guns
and come with us.

54:54.244 --> 54:57.246
Why don't you shine
a light on yourself,

54:57.281 --> 54:59.015
let me see
who I'm talking to?

54:59.049 --> 55:02.351
Why don't I shine a light
on these two instead?

55:06.590 --> 55:10.092
Put down
your guns now,

55:10.127 --> 55:12.895
or these two
get skewered.

55:15.265 --> 55:17.466
Whitey, Cueball, get Billy.
Let's go.

55:17.501 --> 55:18.701
Come on.

55:24.441 --> 55:27.610
Okay, go, go, go!

55:35.115 --> 55:36.760
Aah!
Just take it easy.

55:36.833 --> 55:38.033
We're taking the access tunnels
to home base.

55:40.750 --> 55:43.151
Aah!
Just watch my leg!

55:57.199 --> 55:58.433
Easy!

56:07.410 --> 56:08.510
Ugh! Get it off!

56:08.544 --> 56:10.745
Come on, man, get it off.
Come on.

56:10.780 --> 56:12.747
Are you gonna dose me up?
Come on, buddy.

56:12.782 --> 56:14.983
Here it comes, Billy.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

56:15.017 --> 56:16.451
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

56:16.485 --> 56:18.219
Here it comes.
Here it comes.

56:18.254 --> 56:19.387
You ready?

56:19.422 --> 56:21.423
Yeah, yeah.

56:21.457 --> 56:24.492
You got that?
Attaboy.

56:24.527 --> 56:25.694
How's he look,
Whitey?

56:25.728 --> 56:27.128
He's bleeding hard
in the leg.

56:27.163 --> 56:28.430
Probably nicked
an artery.

56:28.464 --> 56:30.498
Severed it, he'd have
bled out already.

56:30.533 --> 56:32.734
Use your belt.
Bind it tight.

56:32.768 --> 56:35.036
Any of you happen to be

56:35.071 --> 56:38.873
a board-certified microsurgeon,
fix my brother?

56:42.278 --> 56:45.180
Then what good are you?

56:45.214 --> 56:46.681
So, where you from?

56:46.716 --> 56:48.750
Cambridge.

56:53.456 --> 56:56.257
And how are things
in Cambridge these days?

56:56.292 --> 56:58.493
Worse than
they are here.

56:58.527 --> 57:01.062
What are you, family?

57:01.097 --> 57:03.364
Well, obviously not all.

57:03.399 --> 57:06.568
No. Just came together
a couple months ago.

57:06.602 --> 57:08.570
You part
of some resistance?

57:08.604 --> 57:10.105
No.

57:10.139 --> 57:15.043
Just a group of people
trying to survive.

57:15.077 --> 57:16.511
Then where'd you get
the weaponry?

57:16.545 --> 57:19.581
Dead cops,
National Guard.

57:19.615 --> 57:22.350
So, what do we got?

57:22.384 --> 57:24.252
Papa Smurf,

57:24.286 --> 57:26.387
sexy freedom-fighter girl,

57:26.422 --> 57:27.722
strapping young man,

57:27.757 --> 57:30.759
black...
Looks like a gangbanger,

57:30.793 --> 57:36.197
and a...oriental
of some sort.

57:37.500 --> 57:39.734
We'll take the girl
and the boy. The black?

57:39.769 --> 57:41.603
Hell no.
Hell no. Unh-unh.

57:41.637 --> 57:43.304
What about
the chinaman?

57:43.339 --> 57:46.007
Asians are good
at fixing things.

57:46.041 --> 57:47.308
That's true.

57:47.343 --> 57:48.643
We're not gonna
let you drive.

57:50.679 --> 57:54.749
Which brings us
right back...

57:54.784 --> 57:58.520
to Papa Smurf.

57:58.554 --> 58:00.255
See, now, I'm figuring,

58:00.289 --> 58:03.158
since you're the only one
willing to speak up,

58:03.192 --> 58:04.459
that you're their leader.

58:04.493 --> 58:06.094
We need
another leader, boys?

58:06.128 --> 58:08.463
Nah.
I didn't think so.

58:10.166 --> 58:11.733
W-we can get you
more guns.

58:11.767 --> 58:13.301
Where?

58:13.335 --> 58:16.104
I thought you were all
just a bunch of strangers

58:16.138 --> 58:17.906
thrown together by fate.

58:17.940 --> 58:20.742
We're with the resistance. We're
part of the 2nd Massachusetts.

58:20.776 --> 58:23.645
The what?

58:23.679 --> 58:27.315
The 2nd Massachusetts?

58:27.349 --> 58:30.218
Well,
how Revolutionary War.

58:30.252 --> 58:32.020
So, what do you got,

58:32.054 --> 58:34.355
fife and drums,
tri-cornered hats?

58:34.390 --> 58:37.625
No. We have guns.

58:44.466 --> 58:45.733
Hey!

58:49.371 --> 58:52.640
What you have, punk,

58:52.675 --> 58:56.277
is a .50-Cal mounted
to the back of a GTO.

58:56.312 --> 58:59.247
You got 111 fighters
and 200 civilians

58:59.281 --> 59:00.982
camped out
in the big meadow.

59:01.016 --> 59:03.685
I've been watching you...

59:03.719 --> 59:07.655
for two days.

59:09.124 --> 59:11.659
That's why we were
staking out the armory.

59:11.694 --> 59:15.496
Figured you'd be looking
for guns.

59:18.033 --> 59:20.068
I'm not gonna kill
your old man.

59:20.102 --> 59:21.502
Ugh!

59:25.274 --> 59:27.008
Now, he is
your old man, right?

59:27.042 --> 59:31.713
I can't imagine you shouting out
like that if he wasn't kin.

59:34.116 --> 59:36.584
You know what?

59:48.030 --> 59:49.697
We're not gonna
kill anybody.

59:52.368 --> 59:53.935
Not yet.

59:56.238 --> 59:59.140
You're all
way too valuable.

59:59.174 --> 01:00:01.676
So, here's
what we're gonna do.

01:00:03.479 --> 01:00:05.380
We're gonna make a deal.

01:00:06.749 --> 01:00:11.419
You lot for the .50-Cal
on the back of that car.

01:00:13.088 --> 01:00:14.789
Maggie.

01:00:17.059 --> 01:00:20.295
Darling, please escort
young Prince Charming here

01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:21.729
back into town

01:00:21.764 --> 01:00:23.731
so that he can bring
the terms of our deal

01:00:23.766 --> 01:00:26.467
to the supreme
allied commander

01:00:26.502 --> 01:00:30.438
of the 2nd Massachusetts.

01:00:46.581 --> 01:00:49.125
So, what were you...

01:00:49.126 --> 01:00:53.029
You know...before?

01:00:55.633 --> 01:00:58.601
I taught history --
B.U.

01:00:58.636 --> 01:01:01.404
History? What kind of --
kind of history?

01:01:01.438 --> 01:01:02.872
The Sumerians on up,
what?

01:01:02.907 --> 01:01:04.040
American.

01:01:04.074 --> 01:01:05.575
American?

01:01:07.845 --> 01:01:10.880
So, how's
the resistance going?

01:01:10.915 --> 01:01:13.383
Just getting started.

01:01:13.417 --> 01:01:15.151
You honestly
believe that?

01:01:15.186 --> 01:01:17.620
I do.

01:01:17.655 --> 01:01:21.558
History buff such as yourself
ought to know better.

01:01:21.592 --> 01:01:23.660
I taught
the American Revolution.

01:01:23.694 --> 01:01:25.728
You know
how that turned out.

01:01:25.763 --> 01:01:27.430
Yeah.

01:01:27.464 --> 01:01:29.065
But is that
the right, uh --

01:01:29.099 --> 01:01:33.036
what do you call it --
analogy?

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:34.971
Instead of us
being the Colonials

01:01:35.005 --> 01:01:36.873
and the aliens
being the Redcoats,

01:01:36.907 --> 01:01:38.942
isn't it more like
we're the Indians

01:01:38.976 --> 01:01:41.578
and they're the never-ending
tide of humanity

01:01:41.612 --> 01:01:42.712
coming in from Europe?

01:01:42.746 --> 01:01:45.014
How'd that work out
for the Indians?

01:01:45.049 --> 01:01:48.751
Well, if you don't see
any hope...

01:01:48.786 --> 01:01:50.787
Why don't I
just eat a gun?

01:01:50.821 --> 01:01:53.656
Well...I'll tell you,
Professor,

01:01:53.691 --> 01:01:55.959
and this may come off
as a little insensitive,

01:01:55.993 --> 01:01:59.529
considering the 90% of mankind
that's already gone to the grave.

01:01:59.563 --> 01:02:01.965
But the arrival
of these evil creatures

01:02:01.999 --> 01:02:05.435
is the best damn thing
that's ever happened to me.

01:02:05.469 --> 01:02:09.639
See, we've been on a bug hunt
the last six months,

01:02:09.673 --> 01:02:12.642
and we've been
having a blast.

01:02:12.676 --> 01:02:15.411
Maggie. Is that your name?
No.

01:02:15.446 --> 01:02:16.813
Huh.

01:02:16.847 --> 01:02:18.281
I could have sworn

01:02:18.315 --> 01:02:20.016
I heard him say
that your name was Maggie.

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:21.985
You heard wrong.

01:02:22.019 --> 01:02:24.087
I want you
to consider something.

01:02:24.121 --> 01:02:25.922
And I want you to shut up.

01:02:25.956 --> 01:02:28.358
You should join us.
We're fighting back.

01:02:28.392 --> 01:02:30.693
Shut up...now.

01:02:37.835 --> 01:02:40.370
Are you stupid?

01:02:40.404 --> 01:02:42.705
I figured
it was worth a shot.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:45.074
You do anything
like that again,

01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:47.543
and I will use the gun.

01:02:49.647 --> 01:02:51.681
Get up.

01:02:58.355 --> 01:02:59.722
Turn around.

01:03:04.495 --> 01:03:05.828
Bag.

01:03:11.735 --> 01:03:12.902
Walk.

01:03:15.839 --> 01:03:19.842
What do you call them...
Spidery bastards?

01:03:19.877 --> 01:03:22.712
Skitters.
That's good.

01:03:22.746 --> 01:03:24.580
We call them Cooties,
you know,

01:03:24.615 --> 01:03:27.850
like the, uh...
kids' game.

01:03:27.885 --> 01:03:30.653
Well,
before the Cooties came,

01:03:30.688 --> 01:03:33.690
I was always going up
against cops

01:03:33.724 --> 01:03:35.858
and, you know,
people like me.

01:03:35.893 --> 01:03:39.228
But you go around killing people
today, even the bad guys,

01:03:39.263 --> 01:03:41.297
and people tend to get
a bit uptight.

01:03:41.332 --> 01:03:45.034
But Cooties --
it's open season on them.

01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:46.903
You killed any?

01:03:48.672 --> 01:03:49.973
A few.

01:03:50.007 --> 01:03:51.074
How?

01:03:51.108 --> 01:03:52.542
Rifle.

01:03:52.576 --> 01:03:54.043
Shoot for the head?

01:03:54.078 --> 01:03:55.979
It seems to do the trick.

01:03:56.013 --> 01:03:57.947
Well, I hate to be the one
to tell you, friend,

01:03:57.982 --> 01:03:59.849
but you've been going
about it all wrong!

01:04:01.585 --> 01:04:03.353
You don't shoot
for the head.

01:04:03.387 --> 01:04:05.555
You take out
a couple of legs.

01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:07.890
You slow them down.
It weakens them.

01:04:07.925 --> 01:04:10.960
Then you take
the head shot.

01:04:10.995 --> 01:04:14.530
You ever go one-on-one?

01:04:14.565 --> 01:04:18.101
This one I did solo.

01:04:18.135 --> 01:04:23.473
Thought I was gonna die,
but I didn't -- it did.

01:04:23.507 --> 01:04:27.010
You ever take down a ship?

01:04:27.044 --> 01:04:30.079
The Cooties
and their robot friends

01:04:30.114 --> 01:04:31.814
respond to sound, right?

01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:34.717
The ships -- they go off heat.
You know that?

01:04:34.752 --> 01:04:35.952
Mm-hmm.

01:04:35.986 --> 01:04:38.021
Well, we raided
the armory, right?

01:04:38.055 --> 01:04:41.057
We got ourselves
a genuine bazooka, right?

01:04:41.091 --> 01:04:42.959
And we're like,
"all right."

01:04:42.993 --> 01:04:45.028
So we -- we peel
this engine block

01:04:45.062 --> 01:04:48.064
out of an old Volkswagen, right,
and we set it on fire.

01:04:48.098 --> 01:04:50.333
It gets hot enough,
magnesium just, you know,

01:04:50.367 --> 01:04:52.502
ignites, like staring
into the heart of the sun.

01:04:52.536 --> 01:04:56.072
Having a few beers,
lo and behold...

01:04:56.106 --> 01:04:59.542
In comes
this airship, right?

01:04:59.576 --> 01:05:02.812
Billy takes a bazooka,

01:05:02.846 --> 01:05:05.548
gets a Cootie bird
in its sights,

01:05:05.582 --> 01:05:06.682
lets a shell fly.

01:05:06.717 --> 01:05:07.984
It arcs.

01:05:08.018 --> 01:05:11.521
I mean, it's going --
I don't know.

01:05:11.555 --> 01:05:14.557
The ship must have sensed
something, right?

01:05:14.591 --> 01:05:15.925
It must have sensed it,

01:05:15.959 --> 01:05:18.895
'cause it -- it just deked
out of the way.

01:05:18.929 --> 01:05:22.465
That would've been sweet.

01:05:23.834 --> 01:05:25.835
Hey, you think
I could have a beer?

01:05:27.171 --> 01:05:30.706
Why the hell not?

01:05:30.741 --> 01:05:34.010
Don't go anywhere.

01:05:42.653 --> 01:05:44.754
You've got one hour.

01:05:55.833 --> 01:05:57.800
Do you know them?

01:06:00.137 --> 01:06:02.939
No.

01:06:02.973 --> 01:06:06.576
Wonder what happened
to them.

01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:08.111
As far as I heard,

01:06:08.145 --> 01:06:09.879
people from this area

01:06:09.913 --> 01:06:12.915
were herded to the camp
in Stockton.

01:06:14.618 --> 01:06:15.885
Then nuked.

01:06:15.919 --> 01:06:17.587
After the kids
were taken.

01:06:17.621 --> 01:06:18.988
What can I do
for you, Doc?

01:06:19.022 --> 01:06:22.525
I had some more thoughts
on the housing.

01:06:22.559 --> 01:06:24.760
Mm.
You're still on that.

01:06:24.795 --> 01:06:26.729
Actually, yes, 'cause
it's still not fair.

01:06:26.763 --> 01:06:28.164
You back already?

01:06:28.198 --> 01:06:29.832
We have a problem.

01:06:29.867 --> 01:06:31.367
Where's your father?

01:06:31.401 --> 01:06:33.970
Don't do
anything stupid.

01:06:34.004 --> 01:06:37.573
Come on,
I just want a beer.

01:06:42.179 --> 01:06:43.713
It's cold.

01:06:43.747 --> 01:06:46.449
Yeah.
Ain't we civilized?

01:06:46.483 --> 01:06:48.417
Got ourselves
and old, uh, fridge there

01:06:48.452 --> 01:06:50.253
running off our genny.

01:06:51.622 --> 01:06:54.490
Yeah.

01:06:54.525 --> 01:06:58.161
So, he your only kid,
the one I sent back to town?

01:06:58.195 --> 01:07:00.062
No, I have two other boys.

01:07:00.097 --> 01:07:01.898
They with you?

01:07:01.932 --> 01:07:04.967
One is.
The other one's harnessed.

01:07:05.002 --> 01:07:07.069
Damn.

01:07:07.104 --> 01:07:09.305
You know where he is?

01:07:09.339 --> 01:07:11.541
Yeah, he was seen
in a group

01:07:11.575 --> 01:07:14.110
a couple days ago,
headed this way.

01:07:14.144 --> 01:07:15.778
Well, you know,

01:07:15.812 --> 01:07:17.446
Maggie saw some of them
down by the hospital.

01:07:17.481 --> 01:07:18.581
Maybe he's with them.

01:07:18.615 --> 01:07:21.417
You know, if I were you...

01:07:21.451 --> 01:07:23.352
I would find him,

01:07:23.387 --> 01:07:25.087
and I would put him
out of his misery.

01:07:25.122 --> 01:07:26.422
That's no way to live.

01:07:26.456 --> 01:07:29.458
You have kids?

01:07:29.493 --> 01:07:31.460
Boy and a girl.

01:07:31.495 --> 01:07:36.499
They, uh -- they're with
their mother in Florida.

01:07:36.533 --> 01:07:39.168
I suppose I should use
the past tense now.

01:07:41.104 --> 01:07:44.674
So, when you gonna do it?
When you gonna make your move?

01:07:44.708 --> 01:07:47.310
Excuse me?

01:07:47.344 --> 01:07:50.613
You've been, uh,
eyeballing Billy's sidearm

01:07:50.647 --> 01:07:52.181
since you got here.

01:07:54.618 --> 01:07:56.285
That obvious, huh?

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.753
I tend to notice
little things like that.

01:07:57.788 --> 01:08:01.023
You know...
Here, I'm thinking

01:08:01.058 --> 01:08:04.594
we're having
this good conversation,

01:08:04.628 --> 01:08:06.929
yet you had
ulterior motives.

01:08:06.964 --> 01:08:09.732
What would you do?

01:08:18.609 --> 01:08:19.942
So, you don't have

01:08:19.977 --> 01:08:22.044
a lot of good conversation
with your men, huh?

01:08:22.078 --> 01:08:24.145
You kidding?

01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:27.683
Last book any of them read
had a dog named spot in it.

01:08:27.718 --> 01:08:29.819
Maybe you should join us.

01:08:29.853 --> 01:08:32.455
Join who?
The resistance.

01:08:32.488 --> 01:08:35.024
You kidding?
Mnh-mnh.

01:08:35.058 --> 01:08:36.692
And why would I do that?

01:08:36.727 --> 01:08:39.629
I can guarantee
good conversation.

01:08:39.662 --> 01:08:41.063
And what do you get?

01:08:41.098 --> 01:08:44.567
Apparently, you know
how to kill Skitters.

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:46.769
You know what,
Professor?

01:08:46.803 --> 01:08:48.404
You kill me.

01:08:48.438 --> 01:08:50.273
I don't know what kind
of fairy tales

01:08:50.307 --> 01:08:53.042
you've got going on in that head
of yours about saving the Earth,

01:08:53.076 --> 01:08:55.011
but the way I see it...

01:08:55.045 --> 01:08:58.648
There ain't no place
this is going but down.

01:09:01.885 --> 01:09:03.853
One's bleeding out.
Click shot him in the leg.

01:09:03.886 --> 01:09:05.587
You mean before he died?

01:09:05.622 --> 01:09:07.256
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

01:09:07.291 --> 01:09:09.058
Mike, get in here.

01:09:09.091 --> 01:09:11.260
Do you need me to leave?

01:09:11.295 --> 01:09:13.662
No. You stay.

01:09:13.697 --> 01:09:16.365
Tom and his team were taken
hostage by a gang of outlaws.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:17.733
Click's dead.

01:09:17.768 --> 01:09:20.136
It wasn't my dad's fault,
all right?

01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:21.237
It was a trap.

01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:22.971
Yeah, they want
to make a deal.

01:09:23.006 --> 01:09:27.209
We give them the .50,
they give us Tom and his team.

01:09:30.046 --> 01:09:31.781
How do we
make the trade?

01:09:31.814 --> 01:09:34.483
We don't.

01:09:34.518 --> 01:09:35.917
What?

01:09:35.952 --> 01:09:37.886
You don't understand
what's happening, do you?

01:09:37.921 --> 01:09:39.988
We start negotiating with them,
they will bleed us dry,

01:09:40.023 --> 01:09:42.191
if they don't just hit us now,
which they probably will.

01:09:42.225 --> 01:09:44.093
Schlatter and O'Neill,
get in here!

01:09:44.127 --> 01:09:45.694
You go wake up
your civilians.

01:09:45.729 --> 01:09:47.296
They need to be ready
to move in 10.

01:09:47.331 --> 01:09:49.965
Oh -- oh,
we're just gonna run?

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.734
You want to go fight them?
Me too.

01:09:52.769 --> 01:09:55.171
You have any idea
where they are?

01:09:55.205 --> 01:09:57.406
You had a bag
on your head.

01:09:57.441 --> 01:09:59.909
They were in an auditorium.
It looked like a school.

01:09:59.943 --> 01:10:02.244
Oh, do you have any idea how
many schools there are in Acton?

01:10:02.279 --> 01:10:04.947
Because I don't.

01:10:04.981 --> 01:10:08.684
All right, we'll just go
to this factory that you found.

01:10:08.719 --> 01:10:10.286
It's gonna have to do.

01:10:12.222 --> 01:10:14.924
The guy put a gun
to my father's head.

01:10:14.958 --> 01:10:16.292
He's gonna kill him.

01:10:16.326 --> 01:10:19.161
If all I had were fighters,

01:10:19.196 --> 01:10:20.930
we would go
and we would find him,

01:10:20.964 --> 01:10:22.865
but I have 200 civilians
to worry about.

01:10:22.899 --> 01:10:24.767
Now, after we get
all of them safe,

01:10:24.801 --> 01:10:26.435
we will go look
for your father.

01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:28.003
I'm going now.

01:10:28.038 --> 01:10:29.238
No, you're not.

01:10:29.272 --> 01:10:31.407
Mike, take him next door.

01:10:31.441 --> 01:10:33.409
Watch him
till it's time to go.

01:10:33.443 --> 01:10:36.078
Sound the alarm.
We're moving out.

01:10:36.113 --> 01:10:38.381
Civilians.

01:10:38.415 --> 01:10:42.084
Please, Mike,
you got to let me go.

01:10:42.119 --> 01:10:43.786
It's a damn shame.

01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:45.187
I know, but it doesn't have
to be.

01:10:45.222 --> 01:10:48.090
I meant...
It's a damn shame

01:10:48.125 --> 01:10:51.060
how you were able to overpower
me and take my weapon.

01:10:54.431 --> 01:10:56.766
Should I hit you, like,
make it look good?

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.834
No.
No, you should not hit me.

01:10:58.869 --> 01:11:01.036
Just --
just block the door.

01:11:01.071 --> 01:11:02.905
All right.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.708
I'm gonna leave
your rifle here.

01:11:05.742 --> 01:11:07.176
No, take it.

01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:08.911
That girl
that brought me here --

01:11:08.945 --> 01:11:11.347
if she saw me with a gun,
I think she'd shoot me.

01:11:14.351 --> 01:11:16.619
I may be able to help you.

01:11:24.661 --> 01:11:26.495
Okay.

01:11:26.529 --> 01:11:29.331
Where is she?

01:11:29.366 --> 01:11:33.002
I don't know.

01:11:33.036 --> 01:11:34.370
Where's the .50?

01:11:36.239 --> 01:11:37.539
I'm a doctor.

01:11:37.574 --> 01:11:40.676
I understand one of your men
is badly wounded.

01:11:43.113 --> 01:11:45.614
I take you there,
you may never leave.

01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:48.884
It's all we've got.

01:11:53.657 --> 01:11:55.257
Is it bad or wicked bad?

01:11:55.292 --> 01:11:56.492
Oh, it's wicked bad, bro.

01:11:56.526 --> 01:11:58.260
Do you want me
to load you up again?

01:11:58.295 --> 01:12:00.529
Yeah, man, dose me up.
Dose me up.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:07.369
Oh, this does not look like
it's gonna make me very happy.

01:12:07.404 --> 01:12:09.471
You tell me you have
that GTO in the parking lot,

01:12:09.506 --> 01:12:13.342
or I am gonna be
very...disappointed.

01:12:17.414 --> 01:12:18.647
I'm a doctor.

01:12:18.682 --> 01:12:20.616
I might be able
to help your brother.

01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:22.751
What kind of doctor?

01:12:25.155 --> 01:12:27.056
The only one you've got.
Is that him?

01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:28.557
Hold on.

01:12:38.335 --> 01:12:41.503
If I fix him,
will you let us leave?

01:12:41.538 --> 01:12:43.105
You fix him,
I'll let you <i>live.</i>

01:12:53.483 --> 01:12:55.017
Whoa.
What -- what happened?

01:12:55.051 --> 01:12:56.852
Easy, easy.

01:12:56.886 --> 01:12:59.321
Dr. Quinn, medicine woman, here
just stitched up your artery.

01:12:59.356 --> 01:13:00.422
She stopped the bleeding.

01:13:00.457 --> 01:13:02.191
You're gonna be okay,
all right?

01:13:02.225 --> 01:13:03.392
You got the tube?

01:13:03.426 --> 01:13:04.526
Yeah.

01:13:04.561 --> 01:13:06.362
How about the shells?
Yep.

01:13:06.396 --> 01:13:08.330
Where you going?

01:13:08.365 --> 01:13:10.332
To rob
the 2nd Massachusetts.

01:13:10.367 --> 01:13:11.533
You sit this one out.

01:13:11.568 --> 01:13:12.634
Yeah, you think?

01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:14.403
I'm leaving you, Maggie,
and Cueball.

01:13:14.437 --> 01:13:16.839
Anybody tries anything,
pop them.

01:13:19.609 --> 01:13:21.276
Hey, you know me, huh?

01:13:21.311 --> 01:13:23.612
Yeah, that's why I'm leaving
Maggie and Cueball --

01:13:23.646 --> 01:13:25.581
so you don't do it
just for laughs.

01:13:25.615 --> 01:13:28.350
Well, that's no fun!

01:13:34.457 --> 01:13:37.493
Move, move! Everyone move this way!
Let me understand this.

01:13:37.527 --> 01:13:38.961
I'm supposed to believe

01:13:38.995 --> 01:13:40.829
that you let a 17-year-old
get the better of you?

01:13:40.864 --> 01:13:42.464
Is that what I'm
supposed to believe?

01:13:42.499 --> 01:13:44.666
When we get safe and settled,
there will be consequences.

01:13:48.705 --> 01:13:51.540
Defensive positions!
Far tree line now!

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.988
You in charge?

01:14:06.022 --> 01:14:08.290
I am.

01:14:08.324 --> 01:14:10.259
You the one
took my fighters?

01:14:10.293 --> 01:14:11.727
I did.

01:14:11.761 --> 01:14:13.962
You better tell your people

01:14:13.997 --> 01:14:15.731
to put down the weapons
and run.

01:14:15.765 --> 01:14:17.599
Like hell.

01:14:20.069 --> 01:14:21.503
If I give the signal,

01:14:21.538 --> 01:14:24.673
my guys will open up
on your civilians.

01:14:28.044 --> 01:14:30.345
You give any kind
of signal whatsoever,

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:32.281
it'll be the last thing
that you do.

01:14:32.315 --> 01:14:34.283
Listen, chief.

01:14:34.317 --> 01:14:36.685
A patrol ship is gonna pick up
on those flares,

01:14:36.719 --> 01:14:38.287
and when they do,

01:14:38.321 --> 01:14:40.989
they're not gonna fire nukes,
but they will hit hard,

01:14:41.024 --> 01:14:44.493
and anyone still left
in this meadow...

01:14:44.527 --> 01:14:46.962
will be killed.

01:14:46.996 --> 01:14:49.998
I'm not asking
for your rifles.

01:14:50.033 --> 01:14:52.668
I got enough of that to last me
the next 10 years.

01:14:52.702 --> 01:14:56.572
All I'm asking for is the food
you have right now,

01:14:56.606 --> 01:15:00.576
the .50 Cal,
and that sweet little GTO.

01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:06.081
In exchange, I give you
your friends back.

01:15:13.957 --> 01:15:17.526
Leave the food.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.794
Go!

01:15:18.828 --> 01:15:20.662
Yes, sir.

01:15:22.832 --> 01:15:24.933
I will get you.

01:15:35.445 --> 01:15:36.945
Get up.

01:15:39.983 --> 01:15:41.750
He's talking to you.

01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:47.122
I said get up!

01:15:50.493 --> 01:15:52.060
That's it.

01:15:54.497 --> 01:15:56.398
Now turn around.

01:15:56.432 --> 01:15:59.735
I want to see what we got.

01:16:01.771 --> 01:16:04.640
Look at you.

01:16:04.674 --> 01:16:06.675
You are a pretty one.

01:16:09.279 --> 01:16:12.548
We're gonna have ourselves
a good time, you know that?

01:16:12.582 --> 01:16:14.850
Hey.

01:16:14.884 --> 01:16:16.919
Is Billy gonna live?

01:16:16.953 --> 01:16:19.888
What?

01:16:19.923 --> 01:16:23.458
Yes, uh, if he
doesn't get infected.

01:16:23.493 --> 01:16:25.961
Hey, what are you
asking her that -- ugh!

01:16:25.995 --> 01:16:27.930
Ugh!

01:16:32.936 --> 01:16:37.906
After they grabbed me
three months ago, Billy...

01:16:37.941 --> 01:16:42.344
Let's just say
he deserved to die.

01:16:42.378 --> 01:16:45.948
Cueball thought he was better
'cause he brought chocolate.

01:16:45.982 --> 01:16:47.849
He wasn't.

01:16:55.034 --> 01:16:57.169
Let's go, let's go!
Come on!

01:16:57.203 --> 01:16:59.204
Let's go! <i>Ándale!</i>

01:16:59.238 --> 01:17:00.405
Just leave it!
Let's go!

01:17:07.613 --> 01:17:09.147
All right,
what's that?

01:17:09.182 --> 01:17:10.482
Who's firing
those guns?

01:17:10.516 --> 01:17:12.117
It's Tom.

01:17:12.151 --> 01:17:14.152
You have to get everyone
to follow us

01:17:14.187 --> 01:17:15.720
take them, Mike.
Take them.

01:17:15.755 --> 01:17:17.689
Let's go.

01:17:20.326 --> 01:17:21.526
What the...

01:17:26.666 --> 01:17:29.768
Take the .50 now!

01:17:36.509 --> 01:17:38.577
All right,
on the .50!

01:17:39.846 --> 01:17:41.213
Go!

01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:48.854
Cease fire, cease fire,
cease fire!

01:17:49.822 --> 01:17:50.792
Can you hear me, Pope?!

01:17:50.793 --> 01:17:53.795
My ears are still ringing,
but...Yeah!

01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:56.665
Those my own guns
you're firing at me?!

01:17:56.699 --> 01:17:58.200
They are!

01:17:59.168 --> 01:18:01.736
You better run,
Professor!

01:18:01.771 --> 01:18:03.972
Ships are gonna target
the flares.

01:18:04.006 --> 01:18:06.908
You're in the middle
of the flares.

01:18:08.678 --> 01:18:10.145
What are my options?

01:18:10.179 --> 01:18:11.746
Join or die.

01:18:11.781 --> 01:18:13.748
Just like the revolution, huh?
Just like.

01:18:13.783 --> 01:18:15.717
Well, tell you what --
why don't we just sit tight?

01:18:15.751 --> 01:18:19.421
We'll see how the, uh --
see how the air strikes go.

01:18:19.455 --> 01:18:21.490
If that's how you want
to play it.

01:18:21.524 --> 01:18:24.826
I drive,
you follow close, okay?

01:18:24.861 --> 01:18:27.429
They can't see you,
they can't shoot you.

01:18:53.156 --> 01:18:55.590
Well, I guess you got me
after all.

01:18:55.625 --> 01:18:56.858
Get out.

01:18:59.462 --> 01:19:01.930
One wrong move,
I take your head off.

01:19:01.964 --> 01:19:04.633
I believe you would.

01:19:06.936 --> 01:19:08.470
Come on!

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.615
Captain.

01:19:20.650 --> 01:19:22.317
You get Click's body?

01:19:22.351 --> 01:19:24.853
We did.

01:19:24.887 --> 01:19:26.922
We'll bury him tomorrow.

01:19:30.726 --> 01:19:32.394
This was no good today.

01:19:32.428 --> 01:19:34.896
We almost lost you,
your squad,

01:19:34.931 --> 01:19:37.499
and Hal and Anne
were reckless.

01:19:37.533 --> 01:19:39.501
Hal's young.

01:19:39.535 --> 01:19:42.604
He just did what he did
to save his father.

01:19:42.638 --> 01:19:44.239
Anne's a civilian,

01:19:44.273 --> 01:19:46.808
and we don't want
lose our doctor.

01:19:46.842 --> 01:19:50.679
As for you, you got your team
taken hostage.

01:19:50.713 --> 01:19:54.583
We almost lost our best weapon
and a lot of our food.

01:19:54.617 --> 01:19:58.486
And we almost lost them
to a bunch of criminals

01:19:58.521 --> 01:20:00.822
with A.K.s
and road flares.

01:20:00.856 --> 01:20:02.257
This time, it worked out,

01:20:02.291 --> 01:20:04.793
but there's a reason
we have a chain of command,

01:20:04.827 --> 01:20:07.662
and you better damn well
make sure people follow it.

01:20:07.697 --> 01:20:10.532
You can start
when you get back.

01:20:10.566 --> 01:20:12.934
Thanks.

01:20:12.969 --> 01:20:15.337
I said you could go look
for your son

01:20:15.371 --> 01:20:17.439
after you checked out
the armory.

01:20:17.473 --> 01:20:19.708
Do you have any idea
where he is?

01:20:19.742 --> 01:20:22.777
Uh, that woman that was
with Pope -- Margaret --

01:20:22.812 --> 01:20:25.013
said she saw some harnessed kids
out by a hospital.

01:20:25.047 --> 01:20:26.381
I thought we'd start there.

01:20:26.415 --> 01:20:27.983
I'll give you three days.

01:20:29.318 --> 01:20:31.486
Well, good.

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:33.421
And there's something you can do
before you leave.

01:20:33.456 --> 01:20:35.423
There's your prisoner
right here.

01:20:35.458 --> 01:20:37.425
His cell
should be ready by now.

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:40.028
Go ahead and escort him.

01:20:42.665 --> 01:20:45.233
What are you
gonna do with me?

01:20:45.268 --> 01:20:47.435
Oh, that hasn't been
decided yet.

01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:48.870
What about Maggie?

01:20:48.904 --> 01:20:52.207
She wants to earn her
citizenship in the 2nd Mass

01:20:52.241 --> 01:20:53.308
by being a fighter.

01:20:53.342 --> 01:20:56.945
Should've taken me up
on my offer.

01:20:56.979 --> 01:20:59.381
And join
your tattered remnants?

01:20:59.415 --> 01:21:01.416
I'll take a rest
for a little while.

01:21:01.450 --> 01:21:03.952
Being the leader of a
post-apocalyptic gang of outlaws

01:21:03.986 --> 01:21:06.054
has been exhausting.

01:21:14.297 --> 01:21:15.397
Hey.

01:21:15.431 --> 01:21:18.400
Thanks for coming today
with Hal.

01:21:18.434 --> 01:21:20.335
You'd do it for me.

01:21:20.369 --> 01:21:22.270
Yeah, I would.

01:21:22.305 --> 01:21:23.438
Dad.

01:21:23.472 --> 01:21:24.539
Got to go.

01:21:24.573 --> 01:21:25.540
Good sticks?

01:21:25.574 --> 01:21:27.542
Not bad.

01:21:27.576 --> 01:21:29.944
Ready for that game of catch
you promised?

01:21:32.315 --> 01:21:34.316
There you go.
Good throw.

01:21:36.352 --> 01:21:38.787
Good catch.

01:21:41.791 --> 01:21:43.591
That's it.

01:21:47.363 --> 01:21:49.297
Got to work
on your off hand.

01:21:49.332 --> 01:21:51.766
My off hand's

01:21:51.801 --> 01:21:53.635
I wasn't talking to you.

01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:57.272
Our old man --

01:21:57.306 --> 01:21:58.940
Pick this up
when we get back.

01:21:58.974 --> 01:22:00.709
Gonna go find Ben?

01:22:00.743 --> 01:22:03.378
That's the plan.
We're gonna bring him back, too.

01:22:03.412 --> 01:22:06.348
So why don't you go inside
and get a little rest?

01:22:09.719 --> 01:22:11.720
Which way?
