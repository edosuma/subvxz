<b>THE OTHER WIFE</b>

00:17.110 --> 00:20.110
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

04:01.006 --> 04:03.408
<i>9-1-1.
What is your emergency?</i>

04:03.442 --> 04:04.777
There's a man in my house!

04:04.810 --> 04:08.281
He's... he's downstairs
in the office.

04:08.313 --> 04:09.814
<i>Where in the house
are you, Ma'am?</i>

04:09.848 --> 04:11.850
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

04:12.050 --> 04:13.852
Debra.

04:17.523 --> 04:19.358
<i>Ma'am, what's happening?</i>

04:20.024 --> 04:21.627
Open the door, Deb.

04:23.461 --> 04:25.397
Open the door!

04:25.430 --> 04:26.498
<i>Ma'am?</i>

04:27.031 --> 04:28.433
Debra.

04:30.636 --> 04:33.039
<i>Officers are in the area and on
their way now, Mrs. Jennings.</i>

04:33.072 --> 04:34.339
<i>Just stay on the line with me.</i>

04:34.372 --> 04:35.707
<i>Mrs. Jennings?</i>

04:43.548 --> 04:45.617
Let me see the hands!

04:45.651 --> 04:47.687
Let me see the hands! Get down!
Get down! Hands up! Okay, okay.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.656
On the ground. On the ground!
I live here.

04:51.990 --> 04:53.893
I swear officer, I live here.

04:55.627 --> 04:57.930
<i>The police have arrived, Ma'am.</i>

04:57.963 --> 04:59.098
Okay.

04:59.130 --> 05:01.433
They've apprehended the suspect.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.470
<i>I'll stay on the line with you
until you reach an officer.</i>

05:04.970 --> 05:07.507
<i>Do you feel safe to go out?</i>

05:12.076 --> 05:13.646
<i>Ma'am?</i>

05:13.678 --> 05:15.380
I think he's gone.

05:15.413 --> 05:18.918
<i>Ma'am, are you okay?
Ma'am, are you okay?</i>

05:18.951 --> 05:20.820
I'm okay.

05:23.122 --> 05:25.525
<i>Okay, I'm gonna stay on the line
with you.</i>

05:29.026 --> 05:30.495
<i>Do you see the police?</i>

05:30.528 --> 05:33.865
Yeah. Yeah, the
police are outside.

05:33.899 --> 05:37.536
<i>Okay, It's alright
to go outside.</i>

05:47.646 --> 05:49.982
<i>Ma'am. Ma'am,
stay where you are. No!</i>

05:50.014 --> 05:52.752
That's my husband!
I'm the one who called.

05:52.785 --> 05:54.687
I'm his wife.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.622
What is going on?

06:05.997 --> 06:07.832
And you're sure he
didn't take anything?

06:07.865 --> 06:09.901
Not that I know of.

06:10.101 --> 06:12.137
He was looking in
my husband's safe.

06:12.805 --> 06:14.973
We'll file a report and I'II,

06:15.007 --> 06:17.442
give you my
card just in case.

06:19.177 --> 06:21.112
He kept calling me, Deb.

06:21.146 --> 06:23.415
Do you know anybody
by that name?

06:23.749 --> 06:24.884
No.

06:26.651 --> 06:29.087
Maybe he thought he was at
someone else's house.

06:29.754 --> 06:31.423
We'll have some officers
patrol the area for the next

06:31.456 --> 06:33.725
couple of nights and make
sure you're okay.

06:34.026 --> 06:35.995
And I'll be in touch.

06:36.194 --> 06:40.098
And we want to apologize again
for the mix up, Mr. Jennings.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.101
We'll show ourselves out.

06:48.005 --> 06:49.441
You okay?

06:49.475 --> 06:52.177
Yeah, I'm just a little scared.

06:52.577 --> 06:56.048
You're afraid he's going
to come back? Mhmm. Maybe.

06:56.081 --> 06:58.717
Okay. Let's stay at
a hotel tonight.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.553
Really? Thank you.
Alright?

07:03.521 --> 07:06.725
You're my love. You're my life.

07:07.225 --> 07:09.528
You want to go pack a bag?

07:10.562 --> 07:11.497
Thank you.

07:37.288 --> 07:39.459
What the hell was that?!

07:39.690 --> 07:42.494
I told you. Time's up.

07:42.694 --> 07:44.096
Where's the money?

07:44.129 --> 07:46.999
I wasn't lying. It
was in the safe. Was.

07:47.031 --> 07:50.902
I had
an opportunity. An investment.

07:51.103 --> 07:52.670
Okay, this would
double your money.

07:52.704 --> 07:56.709
I promise you that.
If you could just wait.

07:56.742 --> 07:59.078
Wait for this investment to
make a profit.

07:59.110 --> 08:04.850
No. No. No. No. You gambled
with my money. And you lost.

08:05.283 --> 08:06.918
You work for me now.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.787
Look, this project of yours.

08:08.819 --> 08:12.290
It's... Look, I don't
feel comfortable.

08:12.324 --> 08:15.294
We're talking
about innocent people here.

08:15.326 --> 08:16.896
We can go to prison.

08:18.764 --> 08:21.701
Not we. You.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.552
Uterine lining, thickening.

08:45.323 --> 08:47.192
Follicles increasing.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.129
That's good?

08:50.361 --> 08:52.597
It's very good.

08:58.604 --> 09:01.740
I can't help but picture a
baby on that screen though.

09:03.140 --> 09:07.078
This is progress. You still
have a long way to go.

09:08.614 --> 09:10.316
Thank you.
Thanks.

09:17.254 --> 09:19.591
I'm sorry, Mrs. Jennings,
but your card declined.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.894
Do you have another credit
card I can try?

09:21.927 --> 09:26.932
Are you sure?

09:26.965 --> 09:28.834
Yeah, I ran it twice.

09:29.033 --> 09:32.004
Okay...
Yeah, here.

10:46.244 --> 10:47.713
No!

11:34.392 --> 11:39.898
Mrs. Jennings, I know this must
be very difficult for you but

11:39.931 --> 11:41.466
we've got to go through
the evidence.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.336
The break-in last night
might be completely unrelated

11:44.369 --> 11:46.172
or it might not.

11:46.370 --> 11:49.240
And, it's possible evidence.

11:50.908 --> 11:53.111
Can I... Can I have that?

11:56.782 --> 11:58.017
Thank you.

11:59.884 --> 12:02.455
Was your husband in any kind
of trouble that you knew of?

12:02.953 --> 12:04.222
Did he have any enemies?

12:04.255 --> 12:05.490
No.

12:05.890 --> 12:07.492
Did you guys owe anyone money?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.328
No.

12:12.264 --> 12:15.900
I mean, we had some debt like
everyone else but that's all.

12:16.100 --> 12:19.105
Did Billy have a life
insurance policy?

12:20.538 --> 12:22.975
Yes, why are you asking me that?

12:23.008 --> 12:25.410
Honey, how are you?

12:25.442 --> 12:27.078
Mom.

12:34.385 --> 12:36.120
Why are you questioning me?

12:36.153 --> 12:38.890
Am I some kind of suspect?

12:38.923 --> 12:40.458
I'm just trying to
get a clear picture.

12:40.491 --> 12:41.993
Well until there's a
lawyer present

12:42.027 --> 12:44.330
my daughter's not saying
another word.

12:44.528 --> 12:46.264
We're sorry for your loss.

12:47.465 --> 12:49.535
We'll be in touch.

13:26.104 --> 13:29.175
I just keep seeing
his body hanging there.

13:32.977 --> 13:37.582
This is not your fault.
It's not.

13:39.417 --> 13:41.187
It's not.

14:53.490 --> 14:55.226
Diamond credit services.

14:55.259 --> 14:56.694
What is your name and
account number, please?

14:56.727 --> 15:01.198
Yeah, hello.
Kate Jennings.

15:01.231 --> 15:07.405
41840936905.

15:08.405 --> 15:12.310
I... there seems to
be a problem here.

15:12.344 --> 15:14.379
There's been a mistake on my
credit card.

15:14.412 --> 15:16.949
Alright Mrs. Jennings, what
seems to be the problem?

15:16.981 --> 15:20.651
It says here that we're
overdraft $4000,

15:20.684 --> 15:25.524
but my husband and I, we pay... we
pay the credit cards off monthly.

15:25.756 --> 15:28.493
You're right Ma'am,
that amount is incorrect.

15:31.663 --> 15:34.198
The current amount due is $29,286.
-No...

15:34.231 --> 15:35.366
What?!

15:35.399 --> 15:38.569
No, that's impossible.

15:41.172 --> 15:46.511
There was a total of $25,000 in cash advances
made since the statement was posted.

17:39.324 --> 17:40.592
Mrs. Jennings.

17:41.593 --> 17:42.827
May I have a word?

17:43.760 --> 17:45.230
Do I know you?

17:45.596 --> 17:46.631
Not directly.

17:46.663 --> 17:47.699
I'm Craig Addison.

17:47.731 --> 17:49.500
A friend of your husband's.

17:49.701 --> 17:51.202
I'm an investment broker.

17:51.402 --> 17:53.639
We were supposed to discuss a
contract today.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.442
I don't know anything about it.

17:56.641 --> 17:58.343
My husband just passed.

17:58.809 --> 18:00.611
I'm so sorry to hear that.

18:00.811 --> 18:02.680
I'm wondering...

18:02.713 --> 18:05.283
Did Billy leave any kind of a
message for you, Mrs. Jennings?

18:05.482 --> 18:06.684
Excuse me?

18:06.718 --> 18:07.719
Well,

18:09.621 --> 18:11.288
if you do find anything that
Billy might have left for me,

18:11.321 --> 18:17.762
or if you need any
assistance, give me a call.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.740
We're gonna watch her.

19:17.555 --> 19:19.257
You're a cosigner on all of
these accounts,

19:19.289 --> 19:21.792
and you never once
looked at them.

19:22.426 --> 19:23.861
I... No.

19:23.894 --> 19:26.932
I mean, Billy took care of all
this stuff.

19:27.699 --> 19:30.169
Listen, Mrs. Jennings,

19:30.535 --> 19:32.204
I'm gonna do you a favor.

19:32.537 --> 19:35.507
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see
any of this.

19:36.473 --> 19:40.244
Your husband is beyond overdrawn
on all of these accounts.

19:40.678 --> 19:44.950
And it doesn't appear that he's
paid any taxes in over five years.

19:45.349 --> 19:46.784
I haven't spent a lot of time
auditing these,

19:46.817 --> 19:48.720
but if you ask me,

19:48.752 --> 19:53.192
I would say he was involved in
some form of money laundering.

19:56.461 --> 19:58.329
What?!

19:58.363 --> 20:01.799
As a cosigner, you could go to
jail for a very, very long time.

20:02.299 --> 20:04.802
No, my husband was a
responsible man.

20:05.403 --> 20:06.471
He was a...

20:06.503 --> 20:08.740
highly regarded physician!

20:09.273 --> 20:11.409
I didn't see any of this.

20:12.644 --> 20:14.413
Good luck, Kate.

20:16.713 --> 20:18.383
Okay.

20:20.451 --> 20:21.620
Kate, wait.

20:21.653 --> 20:23.221
One more thing.

20:23.788 --> 20:26.691
I did notice a number of
funds being funneled

20:26.723 --> 20:28.961
to the account of
another woman.

20:29.559 --> 20:31.262
Debra Stanton?

20:32.963 --> 20:37.501
If I had some questions, I might
look to her for a few answers.

20:40.971 --> 20:42.473
Thank you.

22:06.391 --> 22:08.026
Hi. I have a package
here for Deb. Thank you.

22:08.058 --> 22:11.061
Actually, it's a $30 C.O.D.

22:11.095 --> 22:12.630
Thirty dollars?

22:12.663 --> 22:14.499
Yes ma'am. Are you
gonna pay it or not?

22:14.531 --> 22:16.067
No.
Alright.

22:16.099 --> 22:18.469
The company should pay that,
obviously.

22:18.669 --> 22:20.138
It's not my fault they screwed
up.

22:20.171 --> 22:22.841
I don't just have a bunch of
cash laying around, you know?

22:22.874 --> 22:23.708
Look, no problem.

22:23.741 --> 22:25.042
It'll be at the Post Office when
you do.

22:25.076 --> 22:26.877
You knocked on my door.

22:26.911 --> 22:28.714
That's my property!

22:42.492 --> 22:43.861
May I help you?

22:44.694 --> 22:47.097
No... My car...

22:47.131 --> 22:47.999
My car broke down.

22:48.031 --> 22:49.600
What do you want?

22:51.169 --> 22:53.605
I'm Kate. Do you know who I am?

22:55.071 --> 22:56.574
You're Deb, right?

22:58.175 --> 22:59.510
I know who you are.

23:00.912 --> 23:02.413
I keep hearing your name over
and over.

23:04.182 --> 23:05.750
I know about Billy.

23:05.950 --> 23:07.052
And who are you?

23:09.653 --> 23:11.556
I don't want to cause a scene.

23:11.588 --> 23:13.625
I just need to talk.

23:16.493 --> 23:17.728
Welcome.

23:28.605 --> 23:30.442
So Debra, what do you do
for a living?

23:30.974 --> 23:32.443
We can skip the small talk.

23:32.477 --> 23:33.879
Say what you came to say.

23:35.212 --> 23:36.914
So, you're with Billy?

23:38.883 --> 23:39.985
Yes.

23:41.719 --> 23:43.555
Apparently, so are you.

23:44.188 --> 23:46.224
Has he not told you anything
about me?

23:50.094 --> 23:51.863
I figured something was going
on.

23:52.262 --> 23:54.632
Can't get out and do much
anymore.

23:54.832 --> 23:57.536
'Cause the accident, my
leg. Never could.

23:58.736 --> 24:00.505
He comes up missing so often.

24:00.538 --> 24:02.874
He says it's work, but how
stupid does he think I am?

24:07.845 --> 24:09.581
Well, I'm sorry.

24:10.548 --> 24:11.782
For your sake.

24:12.083 --> 24:13.151
Really?

24:13.550 --> 24:14.519
Yeah.

24:15.952 --> 24:17.556
You just thought you were dating
a nice doctor.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.725
He's the married one, not you.

24:25.930 --> 24:28.467
You didn't know he was married,
did you?

24:29.200 --> 24:30.602
Just breathe, baby.

24:30.634 --> 24:31.903
Are you okay?

24:32.603 --> 24:34.038
Are you one of his patients?

24:34.070 --> 24:35.639
No. I'm not his patient.

24:35.673 --> 24:37.209
I'm his wife.

24:42.579 --> 24:43.615
I don't understand.

24:45.215 --> 24:48.219
That photo. Was that taken
at the Santa Rosa Winery?

24:54.025 --> 24:56.027
Yeah. You know how I know that?

24:56.059 --> 24:57.729
Because he took me there too.

24:57.961 --> 25:00.898
Did you stay at a nice hotel
that was like an old Mission?

25:00.932 --> 25:02.834
And maybe you went night
swimming too!

25:02.866 --> 25:04.568
You need to leave.

25:06.737 --> 25:08.105
I'm calling the police.

25:08.138 --> 25:09.706
Go ahead.

25:09.740 --> 25:10.775
Ask for Detective Samuels.

25:10.807 --> 25:12.943
He'll tell you exactly who I am.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.147
Here, look.

25:25.722 --> 25:27.591
I'm calling Billy.

25:42.205 --> 25:43.774
I'm sorry.

25:43.974 --> 25:45.743
Billy's dead.

25:47.811 --> 25:49.548
He hung himself.

25:49.846 --> 25:51.249
I found his body.

25:53.284 --> 25:56.087
I followed the paper trail
and it led me to you.

25:57.054 --> 25:59.090
I mean, I thought maybe he
was having an affair,

25:59.123 --> 26:01.726
but married to another woman?

26:02.159 --> 26:04.329
How long have you been married?

26:04.894 --> 26:06.597
Two years.

26:06.797 --> 26:07.665
You?

26:09.232 --> 26:11.101
We met in high school,
but we've been married for ten.

26:13.037 --> 26:14.673
And now you're pregnant?

26:16.073 --> 26:17.876
Is it his baby?

26:18.709 --> 26:20.979
Yes. He's my husband.

26:21.178 --> 26:25.216
Okay. I came for what I needed,
so I'm just gonna let myself out.

26:29.053 --> 26:34.759
If you're telling the truth,
then what about the funeral?

26:34.959 --> 26:37.729
We can talk about
that later. Maybe.

26:39.997 --> 26:41.766
Hi.

26:43.267 --> 26:44.635
No!

26:47.003 --> 26:48.205
Drop the phone.

26:51.709 --> 26:52.410
Come on.

26:52.442 --> 26:53.845
We're taking a ride.

26:55.145 --> 26:56.347
Now.

27:16.866 --> 27:18.769
Where are you taking us?
Shut up.

27:21.271 --> 27:23.907
Why did you break into my
home, you son of a bitch?!

27:26.810 --> 27:27.846
Get in.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.228
Why are you doing this?

27:44.095 --> 27:46.163
Does the name Addison
ring a bell?

27:46.963 --> 27:48.265
The investment broker.

27:48.865 --> 27:50.835
Billy owed Addison
a lot of money.

27:51.035 --> 27:54.906
Addison's boy said Billy keeps
it in a locker at the golf club.

27:55.372 --> 27:56.740
The golf club?

27:57.907 --> 28:00.911
Where Billy kept all his
gambling money.

28:07.518 --> 28:10.788
You really didn't know a thing
about that guy, did you?

28:13.089 --> 28:16.060
Anyway, Addison's money
is there.

28:16.393 --> 28:17.996
Billy owes me money.

28:18.796 --> 28:20.699
You're gonna go get it for me.

28:20.897 --> 28:23.934
Who are you and why does Billy
owe you anything?!

28:24.835 --> 28:27.337
Because your husband
wasn't the nice,

28:27.371 --> 28:30.240
upstanding guy you
thought he was, Deb.

28:30.273 --> 28:32.376
She's Kate, I'm Deb.

28:34.778 --> 28:36.047
I'm sorry.

28:37.013 --> 28:38.381
It's really hard to keep all

28:38.414 --> 28:40.384
of Billy's wives straight.

28:41.317 --> 28:43.054
Now drive.

29:08.179 --> 29:10.047
Now you just go in there,

29:10.079 --> 29:13.216
get the money from the
locker, and come back out.

29:13.250 --> 29:14.752
That's all.

29:16.019 --> 29:18.757
What's to stop me from going in
there and calling the police?

29:21.090 --> 29:24.061
Because, by the time they get
here,

29:24.994 --> 29:27.798
all they're gonna find is that
one dead,

29:27.832 --> 29:30.401
and your prints on the murder
weapon.

29:37.441 --> 29:38.942
Get.

29:41.945 --> 29:43.280
Quick.

30:07.371 --> 30:08.840
Yes?

30:08.873 --> 30:10.208
my husband had a
membership here,

30:10.240 --> 30:12.442
and I need to get into his
locker.

30:12.476 --> 30:16.548
His name was, Bill Jennings.

30:16.980 --> 30:18.615
I'm sorry, but,

30:18.648 --> 30:20.851
unless you have a membership
yourself, I can't help you.

30:22.086 --> 30:23.954
My husband just passed.

30:24.654 --> 30:26.891
Can you help me please?

30:35.598 --> 30:37.301
Did you kill my husband?

30:40.237 --> 30:41.172
No.

30:42.306 --> 30:44.375
But he's not really your
husband, though, is he?

30:44.407 --> 30:46.043
Screw you.

30:49.279 --> 30:51.014
I want to talk to you.

30:51.382 --> 30:52.951
You and me.

30:53.150 --> 30:55.253
I want to make a deal.

30:56.452 --> 30:59.123
Level this whole thing out.

31:04.327 --> 31:07.197
Don't touch me.

31:24.580 --> 31:26.016
Thank you.

31:26.049 --> 31:27.918
Just, please, don't mention it.
Okay.

31:27.951 --> 31:29.086
Thank you.

32:21.372 --> 32:24.342
Take your money, and then leave
us alone.

32:25.174 --> 32:26.042
What the hell is this?

32:26.076 --> 32:27.077
Where's the rest?

32:27.111 --> 32:27.712
I...

32:27.744 --> 32:29.045
I don't know.

32:29.078 --> 32:30.480
You're joking, right?

32:30.748 --> 32:32.048
This is ten grand, tops.

32:32.082 --> 32:34.986
Billy owes me half a mil.

32:35.251 --> 32:37.254
I don't know.

32:41.258 --> 32:43.094
There's a lot of money in this
world.

32:43.292 --> 32:44.628
You're gonna find me mine.

32:45.028 --> 32:46.596
One way or another.

32:52.803 --> 32:55.039
My God! What did
you do to her?

32:55.071 --> 32:59.109
You have twelve hours to
refinance your house,

32:59.143 --> 33:04.115
sell your crap, do whatever
you gotta do, to get the money.

33:04.147 --> 33:05.415
Or what?

33:05.449 --> 33:08.686
Or this one, she dies.

33:09.752 --> 33:11.654
And you go down for it.

33:11.688 --> 33:12.656
I'm calling the police.

33:12.689 --> 33:14.392
I've had enough of this.

33:14.424 --> 33:15.726
I don't think so.

33:17.428 --> 33:20.098
See legally, you cosigned
on Billy's business.

33:21.065 --> 33:23.401
And that makes you just as
guilty.

33:24.067 --> 33:25.569
When they find out,

33:25.769 --> 33:27.404
it's jail time.

33:29.440 --> 33:33.411
I'm sure that accountant,
she told you that, right?

33:36.079 --> 33:37.681
Please, just make him stop.

33:37.713 --> 33:40.183
Can you just stop
hurting her, Okay?

33:45.122 --> 33:46.591
Find my money.

33:47.523 --> 33:49.192
Or this one...

33:50.294 --> 33:52.196
Bang.

34:14.885 --> 34:16.487
I'm sorry.

34:19.255 --> 34:20.458
God.

34:21.824 --> 34:23.659
Why did he hit you?

34:24.293 --> 34:27.130
I told him to leave us
the hell alone.

34:27.164 --> 34:28.766
And called him a few
choice words.

34:28.797 --> 34:30.534
Ed didn't like that.

34:30.567 --> 34:33.335
Ed. That's his name?

34:33.670 --> 34:35.639
How did you know that?

34:36.239 --> 34:37.607
Because he told me
between punching me

34:37.641 --> 34:40.077
in the face and me calling
him a pig.

34:42.210 --> 34:44.315
I don't think you should
stay here tonight.

34:44.815 --> 34:46.784
I think you should go stay
with some friends or family,

34:46.817 --> 34:48.518
or something like that.

34:48.784 --> 34:50.587
I kind of take care of myself.

34:53.824 --> 34:56.126
I did, until Billy came along.

35:01.597 --> 35:03.467
Maybe we should just run.

35:03.500 --> 35:06.204
You don't think he can
track you?

35:07.170 --> 35:09.272
Yeah, I do.

35:10.407 --> 35:12.443
Okay. So...

35:12.476 --> 35:15.780
He wants money, we get him
the money, it's simple as that.

35:16.179 --> 35:17.581
You're not gonna call
the police?

35:18.514 --> 35:20.518
I mean he's not a psychic.

35:20.550 --> 35:22.886
He doesn't have ESP.

35:22.920 --> 35:23.854
How would he know?

35:23.887 --> 35:25.489
He'll know.

35:25.521 --> 35:28.326
Kate, I believe him.

35:40.938 --> 35:42.606
I met him at the clinic.

35:44.907 --> 35:47.478
I gathered. I looked
at the patient files.

35:47.510 --> 35:50.313
My leg still hurt so bad
because of the accident.

35:50.514 --> 35:52.249
He was doing these pain
treatments on me.

35:52.282 --> 35:53.584
He really hooked me up.

35:54.483 --> 35:55.786
He was a great doctor.

35:55.818 --> 35:57.188
He helped a lot of people.

35:57.221 --> 35:58.789
I crushed on him hard.

36:00.257 --> 36:01.592
I fell for him.

36:01.791 --> 36:03.259
He proposed after
four months.

36:03.293 --> 36:04.795
What?!

36:05.963 --> 36:07.765
We had a long
engagement.

36:08.264 --> 36:10.300
Billy believed that,
he wanted to be sure

36:10.333 --> 36:13.570
considering that he only wanted
to get married once.

36:18.275 --> 36:19.809
My God.

36:19.842 --> 36:21.611
What's wrong?

36:22.445 --> 36:24.614
There's less than $20 in this
account!

36:27.884 --> 36:31.255
The last time I checked, there
was over $10,000!

36:31.521 --> 36:32.890
Billy cleaned it out.

36:33.623 --> 36:35.358
I don't understand.

36:35.791 --> 36:37.260
If he was so scared of Ed,

36:37.293 --> 36:38.929
why didn't he just give him the
cash?

36:39.829 --> 36:41.665
Maybe he was giving it to
somebody else?

36:44.534 --> 36:46.637
Maybe I have something in my
checking account.

36:52.309 --> 36:53.744
Not anymore.

36:53.777 --> 36:55.579
Billy.

36:56.346 --> 36:57.548
Unbelievable.

36:58.315 --> 36:59.717
Is this your laptop or his?

36:59.750 --> 37:00.918
Yeah, It's both of ours.

37:00.951 --> 37:02.853
He used it more than me.

37:03.052 --> 37:03.920
Okay.

37:05.454 --> 37:06.891
What's all this?

37:10.927 --> 37:12.329
Here, look.

37:12.528 --> 37:14.565
Names, numbers.

37:16.365 --> 37:17.902
Looks like bets to me.

37:18.302 --> 37:19.436
Bets? No.

37:19.469 --> 37:21.572
Billy wasn't a gambler.

37:21.605 --> 37:24.574
I mean, occasionally we'd bet on
the golf, but he wasn't a gambler.

37:24.608 --> 37:27.678
Yeah, maybe you didn't know him
as well as you thought you did.

37:32.048 --> 37:33.717
What are we gonna do?

37:34.518 --> 37:38.289
Ed wants his money in the next
24 hours so,

37:38.487 --> 37:39.889
we're gonna sell what we can,

37:39.922 --> 37:41.791
borrow what we can,
we get him his money.

37:41.992 --> 37:45.997
Hopefully we can figure out
where Billy put all this cash.

37:46.396 --> 37:47.965
I'm not staying here.

37:47.998 --> 37:49.400
Ed's gonna come back.

37:50.599 --> 37:52.302
You can stay with me.

37:52.335 --> 37:53.703
At your house?

37:54.538 --> 37:56.007
You and Billy's?

37:57.340 --> 37:58.875
Well, at least we'll be
safe there.

37:58.909 --> 38:01.878
The police are patrolling the
neighborhood.

39:02.806 --> 39:04.974
Did Billy buy you this car?

39:06.742 --> 39:08.645
We bought it together.

39:12.715 --> 39:16.619
He said he had all these medical
school loans and...

39:17.887 --> 39:19.590
we couldn't buy much.

39:22.425 --> 39:23.860
I'm an idiot.

39:26.596 --> 39:28.565
You're not an idiot.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.069
I can see why he would
have liked you.

39:35.771 --> 39:37.875
Your smart and pretty.

39:39.576 --> 39:42.445
Sounds like you guys had
fun together.

39:43.847 --> 39:44.748
We had some fun.

39:44.780 --> 39:46.384
I was just some fun.

39:48.083 --> 39:50.653
That's not what I meant.

39:55.192 --> 39:57.927
I mean, it felt like, you
know...

40:00.030 --> 40:02.466
He was the love of my life.

40:04.099 --> 40:06.002
And I was his.

40:33.630 --> 40:35.566
Kate, there's a cop car.

40:37.132 --> 40:38.835
We can't go in there.

40:40.202 --> 40:41.204
Kate.

40:41.237 --> 40:43.506
What am I supposed to do?

40:43.974 --> 40:45.709
It'll be okay.

40:45.909 --> 40:48.045
When Ed hit me in the car today,

40:48.077 --> 40:50.514
Kate, I could see it
in his eyes.

40:50.547 --> 40:53.483
And he will kill me,
and he'll kill you.

40:53.682 --> 40:55.619
He's dangerous.

40:55.818 --> 40:58.822
I think we
just need to remain calm.

40:58.855 --> 41:00.257
Kate!

41:00.289 --> 41:01.657
Where have you been?

41:01.690 --> 41:03.526
I've been worried sick.

41:06.262 --> 41:07.630
Whose this?

41:08.197 --> 41:09.799
This is Deb.

41:10.534 --> 41:12.603
We need to talk.

41:23.313 --> 41:24.615
Mrs. Jennings.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.517
Yes?

41:29.052 --> 41:31.622
The coroner is ruling
Billy's death a suicide.

41:32.322 --> 41:34.090
Then what are you doing here?

41:34.757 --> 41:37.226
Because the more poking around I
do about your husband,

41:37.260 --> 41:39.596
the more complicated things
become.

41:39.628 --> 41:42.164
And I no longer believe the
break-in,

41:42.197 --> 41:45.034
the night before his
death, was just a break-in.

41:45.568 --> 41:48.838
I think your husband was involved in
illegal activities, Mrs. Jennings,

41:48.871 --> 41:51.107
and I think he was in way over
his head.

41:52.943 --> 41:55.946
I don't think it's a leap to
say Bill had a lot of secrets.

41:56.346 --> 42:00.650
While I don't believe the man who
broke into your house murdered Billy.

42:00.849 --> 42:04.788
I do believe that he was involved
with Billy's business, somehow.

42:04.987 --> 42:06.822
Or, I mean, he could have
been just

42:06.856 --> 42:08.892
some guy who got
the wrong house?

42:08.925 --> 42:11.128
You suggested that yourself.

42:11.327 --> 42:13.730
Then why did he say the name
"Deb?"

42:14.164 --> 42:15.098
I don't know.

42:15.130 --> 42:16.900
Deb is a common name.

42:17.934 --> 42:19.736
Are you pressing charges,

42:19.768 --> 42:23.172
or do you have some
kind of court order

42:23.206 --> 42:26.242
to look at my husband's
finances, Detective?

42:26.775 --> 42:28.110
No.

42:28.143 --> 42:30.113
But I was hoping that you
could help.

42:30.313 --> 42:34.785
It's been a lot for us, and
this is a family matter.

42:34.818 --> 42:38.055
I would kind of like to take
care of it on my own.

42:38.088 --> 42:39.990
I think we all would.

42:43.259 --> 42:46.730
I want to give this back to you.

42:47.297 --> 42:48.865
Thank you.

42:52.001 --> 42:56.039
If someone is threatening
you, I can help.

42:56.773 --> 42:58.642
We're okay, thank you.

42:59.643 --> 43:00.711
Okay.

43:09.918 --> 43:11.187
Detective.

43:13.056 --> 43:15.092
When can I have
Billy's body back?

43:15.125 --> 43:16.626
Or do I?

43:16.659 --> 43:18.661
I have no idea how
any of this works.

43:18.862 --> 43:20.264
We'll have his body ready soon.

43:20.764 --> 43:23.166
We'll let you know.

43:23.199 --> 43:24.735
Thank you.

43:47.423 --> 43:49.025
Kate?

43:49.059 --> 43:52.262
I'd like to speak to you for a
moment, please?

43:52.461 --> 43:54.097
Yes, Mom.

43:55.965 --> 43:57.901
Just give me a minute, please.

44:04.740 --> 44:05.976
Yes, Mom?

44:06.009 --> 44:07.844
You want to tell me
what's going on?

44:07.876 --> 44:09.779
Exactly what it looks like.

44:10.746 --> 44:12.215
Billy...

44:12.449 --> 44:15.052
married another woman
two years ago.

44:15.251 --> 44:17.086
What I want to know is what
she's doing here,

44:17.119 --> 44:19.455
and what that police
officer was talking about.

44:19.489 --> 44:21.791
Are you in some kind of danger?

44:23.460 --> 44:24.827
No, Mom.

44:24.860 --> 44:26.195
It's fine.

44:27.963 --> 44:29.065
It's okay.

44:42.746 --> 44:45.449
Billy and I got married in
Puerto Rico.

44:45.949 --> 44:47.885
Courthouse.

44:48.918 --> 44:51.387
He said he was too busy working
to go on a real honeymoon,

44:51.420 --> 44:55.058
so we went to San Francisco for
the weekend instead.

44:55.358 --> 44:58.128
Was that in a February?

45:01.530 --> 45:03.032
I remember that.

45:03.065 --> 45:06.235
He had a conference in
San Francisco.

45:06.436 --> 45:08.771
Okay, let's...

45:08.972 --> 45:11.240
Let's get you upstairs.

45:12.208 --> 45:14.144
And some rest.

45:42.204 --> 45:43.973
You got something for me?

45:44.306 --> 45:46.075
Yeah...

45:47.443 --> 45:49.246
There was this cop over here.

45:49.278 --> 45:50.748
Cop?!

46:15.972 --> 46:17.441
Thank you.

46:24.581 --> 46:26.416
So, what's the plan?

46:26.615 --> 46:29.186
I just spent the last few hours
looking through Billy's office,

46:29.219 --> 46:30.854
and I found nothing.

46:31.186 --> 46:32.255
Did you look at his phone?

46:32.288 --> 46:34.157
I mean, should I say "phones?"

46:34.190 --> 46:35.192
Yeah, I looked.

46:35.224 --> 46:37.027
Phones, emails, nothing.

46:38.862 --> 46:41.097
I'm mean, If he's hidden the money
that he got out of the accounts,

46:41.130 --> 46:44.867
then there's no sign of it
anywhere.

46:46.869 --> 46:48.905
What was the last thing
he said to you?

46:49.105 --> 46:51.942
Maybe something you didn't
think much of at the time.

46:52.407 --> 46:56.246
No. He just said "I love you"
before he left for the office,

46:56.278 --> 46:58.481
and then he left me a
suicide note.

46:59.882 --> 47:01.851
What did it say?

47:15.498 --> 47:17.099
That's all?

47:18.166 --> 47:20.002
"Find happiness in new
beginnings?"

47:21.003 --> 47:22.905
It's like a damn fortune cookie.

47:25.074 --> 47:27.344
Well, my mom's gonna lend
us some money,

47:27.376 --> 47:29.445
even though she has no idea what
it's all for.

47:30.480 --> 47:33.182
And I suppose I'll go to the bank
today and see about refinancing.

47:37.487 --> 47:39.523
Did he have a life insurance
policy?

47:40.222 --> 47:41.458
Yes.

47:43.425 --> 47:45.161
But it's all tied up in red
tape.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.429
There's...

47:46.461 --> 47:49.065
There's no chance that we can
get it to Ed today.

47:49.264 --> 47:51.999
Ed is going to kill me!

47:52.434 --> 47:54.070
He's going to kill my baby!

47:55.570 --> 47:58.574
Even if we outrun Ed,
even if he never finds us,

47:58.974 --> 48:00.643
we still stole money from this
"Appleton" guy,

48:00.677 --> 48:02.245
or whatever his name is,

48:02.277 --> 48:04.180
and he's gonna come after us
too.

48:04.646 --> 48:05.648
Addison.

48:06.248 --> 48:07.149
Wait.

48:13.088 --> 48:14.324
What are you looking for?

48:15.958 --> 48:17.393
Someone who might be
interested in what our

48:17.427 --> 48:19.663
friend Ed is doing with
his money.

48:54.262 --> 48:56.532
He's supposed to be an
investment broker.

48:57.132 --> 48:58.701
Seems legit.

49:21.123 --> 49:22.157
Excuse me.

49:22.190 --> 49:24.226
I'm looking for Mr. Addison.

49:24.460 --> 49:27.063
I was supposed to talk
to him today.

49:27.096 --> 49:28.431
Mrs. Jennings.

49:37.373 --> 49:39.075
How nice to see you again.

49:39.108 --> 49:41.577
I was hoping that you
could help me.

49:46.315 --> 49:47.050
Take them to the back.

49:47.083 --> 49:48.485
No!

49:48.518 --> 49:49.552
Call the police!

49:49.585 --> 49:50.552
These men are trying to hurt us!

49:50.585 --> 49:52.154
Please, no!

49:57.226 --> 49:58.729
Come in here!

50:05.467 --> 50:07.636
I appreciate you
coming to see me.

50:08.438 --> 50:11.008
I'd prefer our conversation here
to be private, though.

50:11.474 --> 50:12.709
You understand.

50:17.313 --> 50:19.816
I want to thank you
about your concern

50:19.849 --> 50:22.385
for the package your husband
was watching for me.

50:23.552 --> 50:25.288
You seem like a good person.

50:25.588 --> 50:27.324
That's why I'm going to give
you some advice.

50:29.759 --> 50:32.528
Our associate, Mr. Warwick here, filled me
in on the details of the insurance plan.

50:32.829 --> 50:35.465
He and your husband planned to
offer up the clinic.

50:36.666 --> 50:39.469
I think it would be a good idea
to go forward with that plan

50:39.501 --> 50:42.304
with you as a cosigner in your
husband's stead.

50:43.206 --> 50:45.242
What do you get out of it?

50:45.440 --> 50:47.476
Did you ever wonder...

50:47.510 --> 50:50.113
why Billy killed himself?

50:52.547 --> 50:54.283
I can only guess, but...

50:55.117 --> 50:58.788
it probably had something to do
with the fact that he knew

50:58.820 --> 51:03.726
that me and him are not men
that take "no" for an answer.

51:04.726 --> 51:06.695
We didn't say anything, okay?

51:09.764 --> 51:13.670
It seems to me that you don't
have the funds our friend wants.

51:13.869 --> 51:18.674
That you should take Warwick up,
here, on his gracious offer.

51:19.876 --> 51:23.213
And if you did even one
transaction, right away,

51:23.545 --> 51:25.414
as a show of good faith,

51:26.148 --> 51:28.150
he might be able to wait.

51:28.617 --> 51:31.554
Give you some time to
earn the payments.

51:32.487 --> 51:34.356
What does it involve?

51:34.824 --> 51:37.394
I'd be happy to go over
all the details.

51:48.503 --> 51:51.307
It's a much more elegant
solution for you, Kay.

51:51.507 --> 51:53.643
I would strongly advise
you to take it.

51:53.675 --> 51:58.280
So you want me to take advantage of
people who are in need, or in pain?

51:58.313 --> 52:00.317
There's something I want
to show you.

52:01.384 --> 52:02.385
Look.

52:04.320 --> 52:06.623
This is what happens to people
I have no use for.

52:11.594 --> 52:15.398
Goodbye Mrs. Jennings.
Ms. Stanton.

52:15.431 --> 52:18.168
Let's go.

52:26.208 --> 52:27.409
It's okay.
It's okay.

52:34.382 --> 52:35.618
You're okay.

52:38.420 --> 52:40.455
God, I never should
have gone to her.

52:40.489 --> 52:43.626
She's just an
innocent person.

52:43.659 --> 52:44.760
This is my fault.

52:44.793 --> 52:46.528
It's not your fault.

52:46.561 --> 52:50.232
They're monsters. The Addison
guy's a monster too.

52:51.000 --> 52:55.405
Listen, all we have to do is do what they ask
of us, then they'll be out of our lives.

52:55.438 --> 52:57.539
I can't steal from them...

52:57.572 --> 52:59.608
I just can't.

52:59.641 --> 53:01.944
Kate...

53:01.978 --> 53:03.546
But I can't do it!

53:03.579 --> 53:04.847
You'd be involved anyway.

53:04.880 --> 53:07.450
What?!
Right? If Billy hadn't...

53:07.750 --> 53:09.619
passed away.

53:09.818 --> 53:11.987
You'd be involved because you're
part owner of the clinic.

53:12.021 --> 53:13.823
You'd be part of it and you'd
never even know.

53:13.856 --> 53:17.327
No! But now I'm doing it
knowingly! I can't!

53:17.360 --> 53:19.596
We don't have enough money!

53:20.929 --> 53:22.664
Kate!

53:22.697 --> 53:24.933
If we don't hustle and figure
this out really quickly,

53:24.967 --> 53:27.302
the people they're hurting are
gonna be us.

53:27.335 --> 53:28.904
Okay, It's time to run.

53:30.739 --> 53:32.608
What?

53:32.641 --> 53:35.544
Hey, Hey, Hey! What happened? What
happened? Are you okay? I'm fine.

53:35.577 --> 53:37.346
We have to get you to a
hospital. Stop. Stop.

53:38.780 --> 53:40.317
Deb, We've got to get you to
a hospital.

53:44.820 --> 53:46.356
Squirmy little guy, isn't he?

53:49.692 --> 53:51.027
Takes after his dad.

53:53.528 --> 53:55.864
We'll do a full checkup, but I
have to say he looks great.

53:55.898 --> 53:57.400
Totally healthy.

53:59.034 --> 54:01.003
His heart rate's a little high.
So is your blood pressure.

54:01.436 --> 54:04.007
So, my advice is gonna be for
you to get some rest.

54:04.407 --> 54:04.941
Okay?

54:04.974 --> 54:06.009
Thank you.

54:06.474 --> 54:07.844
See you in a bit.

54:10.512 --> 54:12.481
That's amazing.

54:19.922 --> 54:21.891
You were trying too,
weren't you?

54:22.657 --> 54:24.460
You can't run.

54:25.494 --> 54:27.463
That's no kind of a beginning.

54:27.797 --> 54:29.632
I'm not gonna let
them hurt you.

54:29.831 --> 54:31.034
Either of you.

54:47.550 --> 54:48.785
You look good.

54:48.818 --> 54:49.853
Thanks.

54:50.853 --> 54:52.655
Here goes.

56:05.927 --> 56:07.797
What's she doing in there?

56:07.829 --> 56:09.998
Trying to get a second mortgage.

56:10.199 --> 56:11.634
Let me tell you something.

56:13.568 --> 56:17.706
If I didn't need you
cozying up to Kate,

56:18.106 --> 56:19.976
you'd be dead right now.

56:21.911 --> 56:23.780
She's the important one.

56:25.181 --> 56:27.483
You're just the other wife.

56:31.085 --> 56:32.921
Make it happen.

56:35.523 --> 56:37.726
Jesus Christ.

57:51.032 --> 57:51.900
How'd it go?

57:51.934 --> 57:53.803
Nope.

57:53.835 --> 57:58.207
He already refinanced the house
twice, so, my loan was denied.

58:03.978 --> 58:06.248
How much dough I get for this?

58:09.851 --> 58:11.855
Ten thousand, at least.

58:13.155 --> 58:14.724
What about yours?

58:14.757 --> 58:16.125
It's be more money to
tow it away.

58:18.561 --> 58:19.963
Okay.

58:36.844 --> 58:38.213
How?

58:40.916 --> 58:43.553
Pawn shop down the street.

58:43.585 --> 58:45.087
I'm sorry.

58:46.989 --> 58:49.759
Come on. Let's go sell my car.

59:07.976 --> 59:09.545
Thank you.

59:13.248 --> 59:14.215
How much?

59:14.248 --> 59:15.684
Not enough.

59:17.353 --> 59:20.856
I still think Billy withdrew all
the money and hid it somewhere.

59:20.889 --> 59:22.024
But where?

59:22.056 --> 59:23.926
I don't know.

59:35.903 --> 59:37.974
Let's go ask him.

59:48.349 --> 59:49.985
I'm sorry.

01:00:23.818 --> 01:00:26.822
I did a little background check
on your friend Deb.

01:00:29.057 --> 01:00:31.059
Did you know she did some time?

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:34.964
Check forgery.

01:00:36.364 --> 01:00:37.966
What are you trying to tell me?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.768
It's just interesting.

01:00:40.802 --> 01:00:42.739
She likes money?

01:00:43.972 --> 01:00:45.642
I notice your...

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.777
Your mother's here to
pick you up.

01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:50.913
Did you sell your car?

01:00:53.315 --> 01:00:55.351
I was wondering...

01:00:57.719 --> 01:01:01.056
How much it would cost to have
Bill's body transported, and...

01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:03.826
What if I didn't have
the funds?

01:01:04.492 --> 01:01:07.697
You said, cremation,
I remember.

01:01:08.329 --> 01:01:10.298
I'll have it taken care of.

01:01:10.932 --> 01:01:13.101
Why would you do that for me?

01:01:14.202 --> 01:01:15.804
Because I,

01:01:16.003 --> 01:01:18.674
I feel like you could
use a break.

01:01:23.277 --> 01:01:27.149
If you're in trouble,
just write "yes."

01:01:33.889 --> 01:01:36.159
Everything okay?

01:01:40.762 --> 01:01:42.097
Yes.

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:47.769
Thank you, detective.

01:01:51.773 --> 01:01:54.210
Mom, give us a minute please,
we'll see you in the car.

01:01:59.815 --> 01:02:04.186
Deb, is it true that you've done
time?

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.389
Yeah. It was a long time ago.

01:02:07.422 --> 01:02:09.826
So why didn't you tell me that?

01:02:10.092 --> 01:02:12.027
Are you mad?

01:02:12.059 --> 01:02:13.795
I've made a decision.

01:02:14.295 --> 01:02:16.464
I've seen enough dead bodies to
last me a lifetime,

01:02:16.498 --> 01:02:18.800
and I don't want yours to be the
next one.

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:21.204
So I'm gonna tell Ed and
Addison I'm in.

01:02:23.438 --> 01:02:25.173
Okay.

01:02:39.987 --> 01:02:41.523
You okay?

01:02:41.956 --> 01:02:43.291
Yeah.

01:02:46.561 --> 01:02:49.197
My knee, my back, it's the
same old story.

01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:50.867
I'm falling apart.

01:02:51.065 --> 01:02:53.401
Why don't you go upstairs and
get some rest.

01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:56.072
I'll bring you up a snack, Okay?

01:02:56.271 --> 01:02:57.206
Yeah.

01:02:58.472 --> 01:02:59.775
Here, give me your hand.
Thank you.

01:03:18.626 --> 01:03:20.195
What?

01:03:21.963 --> 01:03:24.132
I wouldn't do anything more for
Deb than you have to.

01:03:27.536 --> 01:03:29.871
There's something
wrong with her.

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:33.909
Okay.

01:03:40.014 --> 01:03:41.616
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:44.320
She's out of options, I think.

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:45.887
Yes.

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:47.923
She's ready.

01:04:24.992 --> 01:04:27.028
I was afraid I was out of luck.

01:04:27.061 --> 01:04:28.364
The other woman...

01:04:28.396 --> 01:04:29.431
Suzanne?

01:04:29.463 --> 01:04:31.634
Yeah, Yeah, she called, she said

01:04:31.666 --> 01:04:34.135
you know, about the doctor.

01:04:36.538 --> 01:04:42.077
My wife said that he healed
her neck pain.

01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:44.881
Said he had miraculous hands.

01:04:45.079 --> 01:04:49.250
Well our new doctor, he trained
with Mr. Jennings.

01:04:49.284 --> 01:04:51.153
So, they're in the same class.

01:04:51.385 --> 01:04:53.355
When we brought him on, I
thought of you.

01:04:53.554 --> 01:04:55.490
You said cash only?

01:04:55.523 --> 01:04:57.393
Yes, up front.

01:04:57.592 --> 01:05:00.896
And then we have your account
details for after that.

01:05:01.096 --> 01:05:02.331
How come it's so much up front?

01:05:02.364 --> 01:05:05.099
We have... processing fees.

01:05:05.132 --> 01:05:07.468
It talks about it here in
the paperwork.

01:05:07.501 --> 01:05:10.206
Whatever you say.
I just need...

01:05:11.539 --> 01:05:13.608
I need a miracle.

01:05:14.141 --> 01:05:15.477
Mr. Moore?

01:05:15.677 --> 01:05:17.012
I hear you're in a lot of pain.

01:05:17.045 --> 01:05:19.081
-Yeah.
-Let me help you. Easy.

01:05:36.364 --> 01:05:37.933
That was good.

01:05:38.166 --> 01:05:39.568
It's a good start.

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:46.041
Who is that man, and what is he
gonna do with Mr. Moore?

01:05:46.507 --> 01:05:47.576
Treat him.

01:05:47.608 --> 01:05:49.277
Of course.

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:51.447
He's some doctor Addison found.

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:55.151
Just another Hippocratic Oath
fanboy.

01:05:55.449 --> 01:05:56.952
Just like Billy.

01:05:57.719 --> 01:05:59.288
Don't be so jumpy, Kate.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.389
Guy's gonna get what he needs.

01:06:07.795 --> 01:06:09.431
Get used to it.

01:06:09.664 --> 01:06:11.200
This is the new regime.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.170
You got a lot more
coming in today.

01:06:43.231 --> 01:06:47.003
It's not polite to put your feet
up on other people's furniture.

01:06:51.539 --> 01:06:53.275
Sorry.

01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:57.278
You don't like me.

01:06:59.748 --> 01:07:03.085
Don't take it personally, but ever since my
daughter met you, she's been falling apart.

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:05.119
That's not my fault.

01:07:05.152 --> 01:07:07.389
I said, don't take it
personally.

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:20.135
You know, a baby is a
wonderful gift.

01:07:20.869 --> 01:07:23.039
Yeah.

01:07:25.172 --> 01:07:28.143
Maybe the only good thing
Billy ever gave me.

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:36.451
Children need strong
role models.

01:07:37.351 --> 01:07:39.353
Not like me?

01:07:39.387 --> 01:07:42.091
That's up to you.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:35.711
Can you just answer
something for me, please?

01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:38.447
I just...

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.684
Why did you sell your ring?

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:47.323
And why did my daughter
sell her car?

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.890
Why did she borrow
money from me?

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:56.298
Be honest, please.

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:09.578
Don't tell Kate I'm telling you.

01:09:10.478 --> 01:09:11.845
Okay.

01:09:14.582 --> 01:09:17.652
We're trying to pay off some
of Billy's debts.

01:09:20.287 --> 01:09:21.823
It's okay now.

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:26.661
I think we've got it worked out.

01:09:28.296 --> 01:09:30.399
Then why are you still here?

01:09:35.636 --> 01:09:37.872
I don't know.

01:10:29.356 --> 01:10:30.524
Deb?

01:10:30.557 --> 01:10:31.859
It's me.

01:10:32.594 --> 01:10:33.895
Mom, what's wrong?

01:10:33.927 --> 01:10:36.030
Your friend Deb, you can't
trust her.

01:10:38.832 --> 01:10:40.635
We've talked about this.

01:10:40.835 --> 01:10:42.404
I'm serious.

01:10:42.436 --> 01:10:44.872
I found something in
the guest room.

01:11:10.965 --> 01:11:12.534
Where is she?

01:11:24.645 --> 01:11:26.282
What are you doing?

01:11:27.582 --> 01:11:29.318
You guys are happy, right?

01:11:30.518 --> 01:11:31.953
You're okay, so...

01:11:32.686 --> 01:11:34.722
You're just leaving?

01:11:35.756 --> 01:11:37.625
Why would I stay?

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.729
Where is it?

01:11:40.761 --> 01:11:42.029
What are you talking about?
The money!

01:11:42.063 --> 01:11:45.333
The money that you kept
from your ring!

01:11:51.072 --> 01:11:53.409
I gave you everything, Kate.

01:11:55.676 --> 01:11:57.813
It's 2000 dollars.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.048
Listen, I have a baby on
the way.

01:12:01.082 --> 01:12:03.018
I take care of myself now.

01:12:03.051 --> 01:12:06.822
In the meantime, I'm becoming
a scam artist for us.

01:12:07.721 --> 01:12:09.925
You pretend like you're
doing this for me.

01:12:09.957 --> 01:12:12.027
Your butt is on the line too.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:14.695
We're doing this together.

01:12:14.729 --> 01:12:15.630
I thought that we...

01:12:15.662 --> 01:12:17.131
What, were friends?!

01:12:17.164 --> 01:12:19.702
We mean nothing to each other.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:22.438
Take it, and get out.

01:12:26.006 --> 01:12:28.643
Now! Get out!

01:12:31.746 --> 01:12:35.716
You know, you have hated me
since the day you met me,

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:38.019
because I'm not Billy's
"real wife."

01:12:38.051 --> 01:12:41.923
I'm some naive slut that he
kept on the side, right?

01:12:42.122 --> 01:12:43.958
That's not how I feel.

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:48.497
You didn't have to say it,
little miss perfect.

01:12:48.529 --> 01:12:49.130
Perfect house.

01:12:49.163 --> 01:12:50.731
Perfect life.

01:12:50.765 --> 01:12:52.601
Every time you see me,
you hate me more,

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:55.837
because I remind you of how
not-so-perfect your husband is.

01:12:55.869 --> 01:12:56.837
No.

01:12:56.871 --> 01:12:58.739
That's not it.

01:12:58.773 --> 01:13:00.909
Yeah, the worst thing about it,
is that you're jealous of me.

01:13:00.942 --> 01:13:02.944
Jealous?
Of what?

01:13:02.976 --> 01:13:04.746
Of that fact that you have no
friends?

01:13:04.779 --> 01:13:05.747
No family?

01:13:05.779 --> 01:13:06.747
No job?

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:08.550
No future?

01:13:08.582 --> 01:13:11.118
You're jealous because you
wanted a baby with Billy,

01:13:11.152 --> 01:13:14.422
and you couldn't have it, and
now you want mine!

01:13:18.025 --> 01:13:19.627
How dare you!

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:22.130
You do not hit a pregnant woman!

01:13:25.567 --> 01:13:27.802
I'm so sorry!

01:13:28.502 --> 01:13:29.570
Get away from her!

01:13:29.604 --> 01:13:31.206
No!
Get away!

01:13:31.238 --> 01:13:33.141
Get away!

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:35.911
Call the police.

01:13:36.511 --> 01:13:39.681
I'm gonna call Detective Samuels
and I'm gonna tell him everything.

01:13:39.713 --> 01:13:42.751
About the fraud, about the
blackmail.

01:13:42.951 --> 01:13:44.185
I don't care.

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:46.188
Ed and Addison will go
to prison.

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:49.957
I'll keep you out, but just get
out of my life!

01:14:15.783 --> 01:14:18.454
The detective's on his way.

01:14:20.054 --> 01:14:21.590
God.

01:14:40.608 --> 01:14:42.944
No. God, no! Please! Please!

01:14:42.976 --> 01:14:44.813
Ouch!

01:14:50.284 --> 01:14:52.753
Okay, I'll go.

01:14:54.555 --> 01:14:56.524
Did you hear that?

01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:10.938
Deb!

01:15:11.171 --> 01:15:12.740
Deb!

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:36.198
Try this one.

01:15:57.185 --> 01:16:01.323
Sh... They want me to
bring the money to the bar.

01:16:01.889 --> 01:16:04.159
Or they're gonna kill her and
frame me for it.

01:16:04.359 --> 01:16:09.197
They could kill you too.
Wait for Detective Samuels.

01:16:09.396 --> 01:16:11.600
Let the police handle this.

01:16:11.798 --> 01:16:13.601
She lied to you, Kate.

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:15.237
What else did she lie about?

01:16:16.136 --> 01:16:18.840
You could be free of
all this, Katie.

01:16:18.872 --> 01:16:21.809
You deserve a new beginning too.

01:16:24.945 --> 01:16:26.648
That's it.

01:16:26.847 --> 01:16:28.149
That's where he put
the money, Mom.

01:16:28.181 --> 01:16:29.850
I need your keys.

01:16:30.685 --> 01:16:32.988
Let the police handle it,
sweetheart.

01:16:34.287 --> 01:16:35.856
Here, give this to Samuels.

01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:37.692
That's where we'll be.

01:16:37.725 --> 01:16:38.793
It'll be okay.

01:16:38.826 --> 01:16:40.328
I love you.
God.

01:16:41.128 --> 01:16:42.898
Be careful.

01:16:51.805 --> 01:16:55.376
Yes, I need Detective
Samuels again. Now.

01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:59.306
Find happiness in your bags.

01:18:47.387 --> 01:18:51.091
At this point, you think you're
walking out of here alive?

01:18:51.125 --> 01:18:54.429
Do you? You think you're
going to live through this?

01:18:54.828 --> 01:18:57.532
Please, no, come on!

01:18:57.564 --> 01:18:59.099
I did everything you told me to!

01:18:59.132 --> 01:19:01.970
I told you when she called
the cops!

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:04.506
I got her in on the scam.
Please!

01:19:05.472 --> 01:19:09.144
If you think you're still getting
a cut, you are out of your mind.

01:19:10.411 --> 01:19:11.512
Shut up!

01:19:11.546 --> 01:19:12.347
Enough!

01:19:15.182 --> 01:19:16.484
Here.

01:19:18.853 --> 01:19:20.288
Take your money.

01:19:32.265 --> 01:19:33.300
Don't bother.

01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:35.135
I know you're working with him.

01:19:35.168 --> 01:19:38.139
We don't mean anything to each
other anyway, remember?

01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:41.176
Warwick!

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:50.919
Where was it?

01:19:50.952 --> 01:19:52.487
It was at Deb's place the
whole time.

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:55.023
I didn't know! I didn't know!

01:19:55.055 --> 01:19:56.490
Unfortunately, I don't trust
you.

01:19:56.524 --> 01:19:58.827
The cops are on their way.

01:19:59.025 --> 01:20:00.494
Take care of them.

01:20:00.528 --> 01:20:02.463
No, please!
Please don't shoot!

01:20:18.011 --> 01:20:19.880
Come on! Come on!

01:20:25.353 --> 01:20:26.887
Okay, we've gotta hide now.

01:20:35.262 --> 01:20:37.131
Did you call the police?

01:20:40.434 --> 01:20:42.270
They're never gonna get
here in time.

01:20:42.302 --> 01:20:45.340
I gave my mom the address, I
told her to send them here.

01:21:05.091 --> 01:21:06.594
I know you're here.

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:09.497
Have you ever used a gun before?

01:21:09.529 --> 01:21:11.198
No.

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.589
Drop the gun!

01:21:36.623 --> 01:21:37.591
Come on!

01:21:37.625 --> 01:21:39.194
Drop it!

01:21:42.128 --> 01:21:43.664
Now, push it away.

01:21:44.297 --> 01:21:45.934
Kick it away.

01:21:46.132 --> 01:21:47.202
Come on.

01:21:48.703 --> 01:21:50.272
Get down on your knees.

01:21:51.505 --> 01:21:53.641
Get down, now!

01:21:54.675 --> 01:21:56.077
Okay, go! Go! Go!

01:21:56.109 --> 01:21:57.177
What are you gonna do?

01:21:57.211 --> 01:21:58.479
You said the cops are coming.

01:21:58.511 --> 01:22:00.380
I'm gonna hold him until
they get here.

01:22:00.413 --> 01:22:01.349
What?

01:22:02.382 --> 01:22:05.519
Kate, you're my only friend.

01:22:06.087 --> 01:22:07.422
And that's the truth.

01:22:08.021 --> 01:22:09.657
So if something goes wrong,

01:22:09.689 --> 01:22:11.224
I just wanna make sure you're
Okay...

01:22:13.527 --> 01:22:14.695
Please! Please! No!

01:22:41.555 --> 01:22:43.490
Police!

01:22:43.524 --> 01:22:45.293
Drop your weapon.
Right now!

01:22:45.326 --> 01:22:46.661
Drop it!

01:22:47.661 --> 01:22:49.297
Drop it!

01:22:51.265 --> 01:22:53.068
Drop your weapon!

01:22:55.235 --> 01:22:56.704
Drop it right now.

01:23:10.717 --> 01:23:12.019
Deb...

01:23:12.386 --> 01:23:15.423
Deb! Deb!
Deb. Deb.

01:23:16.056 --> 01:23:19.626
Deb. She's breathing.
She's still breathing.

01:23:21.261 --> 01:23:23.364
She's still breathing.

01:23:24.664 --> 01:23:26.199
We need paramedics right now!

01:23:26.233 --> 01:23:27.635
Paramedics!

01:23:28.234 --> 01:23:29.470
Hang in there.

01:23:31.505 --> 01:23:32.606
Hang in there.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.642
Hang in there, Deb, please.

01:23:45.853 --> 01:23:49.791
Okay hold on! It's gonna be
Okay.

01:23:49.823 --> 01:23:50.824
I'm right here.

01:23:50.858 --> 01:23:51.826
You're gonna do great.

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:57.065
Hold on! That's it. Honey, now
I need you to push, okay?

01:23:57.097 --> 01:23:58.432
-I can't!
-Yes, you can.

01:23:58.466 --> 01:24:00.501
Just we practiced, remember? -Are
you kidding me? -After three...

01:24:00.533 --> 01:24:01.701
One.

01:24:01.734 --> 01:24:03.837
Two.
Don't let go! Please!

01:24:03.871 --> 01:24:05.706
I'm not gonna let go. I'm right
here. Ready? Something's wrong!

01:24:05.738 --> 01:24:07.841
What do you mean, something's
wrong? What's wrong?

01:24:07.875 --> 01:24:10.078
The baby's breach, we need to
turn him around right now. Okay.

01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:13.213
It's okay, you're doing a
great job.

01:24:40.373 --> 01:24:41.375
How they doing?

01:24:41.408 --> 01:24:43.344
Hey!

01:24:43.543 --> 01:24:45.113
Yeah, great now.

01:24:45.145 --> 01:24:46.547
They're just resting.

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:49.250
Deb's body took it hard, though.

01:24:50.317 --> 01:24:51.719
This is for Deb.

01:24:54.488 --> 01:24:55.722
You don't wanna give it to her
yourself?

01:24:55.756 --> 01:24:57.459
Nah, I don't want to
disturb her.

01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:01.296
I was glad to hear about
your deal.

01:25:01.628 --> 01:25:03.097
I was hoping for that.

01:25:03.296 --> 01:25:05.899
I made myself a little annoying
to the D.A.

01:25:05.932 --> 01:25:07.469
Well, thank you.

01:25:07.667 --> 01:25:09.170
It was the list I could do,

01:25:09.203 --> 01:25:11.706
to give the money back
to those people.

01:25:11.738 --> 01:25:13.707
It was like an amends, really.

01:25:13.908 --> 01:25:16.644
Deb was happy that she could
do that too.

01:25:17.511 --> 01:25:19.247
You're a good person.

01:25:19.445 --> 01:25:23.550
But, if you don't mind me
asking, She tried to extort you.

01:25:23.583 --> 01:25:25.519
Why are you still
friends with her?

01:25:26.619 --> 01:25:29.289
Nobody will ever really understand
what I went through except her.

01:25:30.791 --> 01:25:33.528
So, that's a bond.

01:25:33.927 --> 01:25:35.697
Besides, she's a new mom.

01:25:36.396 --> 01:25:38.832
So she deserves a break.

01:25:40.367 --> 01:25:41.469
Alright.

01:25:41.668 --> 01:25:43.203
Well, give me a hug.

01:25:44.805 --> 01:25:46.240
Alright.

01:25:46.273 --> 01:25:47.742
Thank you.

01:25:47.774 --> 01:25:49.176
Detective.

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:50.711
For everything.

01:25:50.743 --> 01:25:52.813
Alright.

01:26:10.463 --> 01:26:12.766
This is from Detective Samuels.

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.836
What a sweetheart.

01:26:16.502 --> 01:26:18.505
You know, he likes you.

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:20.908
You should go for it,

01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:23.277
but I don't blame you if you
stay single for a while,

01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:25.313
'cause you have awful
taste in guys.

01:26:25.345 --> 01:26:28.215
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:30.885
Hi baby.

01:26:32.319 --> 01:26:34.322
You know what's funny?

01:26:35.588 --> 01:26:38.458
I've never been able to figure
out why one man

01:26:38.492 --> 01:26:41.628
would marry two women who
were so completely different.

01:26:44.698 --> 01:26:47.368
You know, we might be more
alike than you think.

01:26:51.805 --> 01:26:53.474
You okay?

01:26:53.506 --> 01:26:56.944
I'm a mess.
What's new?

01:27:01.715 --> 01:27:02.682
He's so little.

01:27:02.716 --> 01:27:04.552
He's so beautiful.

01:27:07.421 --> 01:27:09.657
You know, I was thinking...
Yeah?

01:27:10.524 --> 01:27:12.894
Won't you be his godmother?

01:27:13.527 --> 01:27:15.596
You're the best person I know.

01:27:20.967 --> 01:27:23.604
That would be such an honor.

01:27:23.904 --> 01:27:24.872
Thank you.

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:27.708
You're practically family.

01:27:33.413 --> 01:27:35.617
We all are.
