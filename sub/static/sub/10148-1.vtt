01:09.237 --> 01:11.781
I don't know.
You can never tell with her.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.741
She's a wacky girl,
you know that?

01:13.824 --> 01:15.159
She's gonna tell us something.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.661
Check it out.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.831
Wow, man, cool!

01:24.168 --> 01:26.295
I don't believe it. Chelsea...

01:26.879 --> 01:27.879
You got spliced!

01:28.923 --> 01:31.342
Crazy, girl. Your dad
must have had a spizz fit.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.511
I don't know, Chels.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.138
Isn't messing with your DNA
a bit drastic?

01:36.222 --> 01:37.390
Even for you?

01:37.473 --> 01:38.599
Please.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.269
Well, then why is the city
trying to shut it down?

01:41.352 --> 01:42.687
Lighten up, Terry.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.814
The law's against practically
everything we're into.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.190
You gotta keep an open mind.

01:46.691 --> 01:48.192
Here's all the info.

01:49.819 --> 01:52.405
Personally, I'd jump on it,
if I were you guys

01:52.488 --> 01:54.608
'cause if you're not the first,
then you're the worst.

01:59.203 --> 02:02.206
<i>They call it splicing,
the new high-tech teen rage</i>

02:02.290 --> 02:04.250
<i>that has taken
Gotham's youth by storm.</i>

02:04.917 --> 02:06.836
<i>But outraged parents
and lawmakers</i>

02:06.919 --> 02:08.838
<i>call the use of genetic
animal augmentation</i>

02:08.921 --> 02:10.464
<i>a crime against nature.</i>

02:10.715 --> 02:12.300
<i>Some say it's a matter of choice.</i>

02:13.092 --> 02:14.969
Splicing is like
establishing myself

02:15.052 --> 02:16.470
as an individual, you know?

02:16.554 --> 02:18.222
Just like all my friends.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.391
- Yeah, that's right.
- You tell him, man.

02:21.517 --> 02:23.436
At the center
of the controversy is the director

02:23.519 --> 02:25.730
<i>of the Chimera Institute,
Dr. Abel Cuvier.</i>

02:26.188 --> 02:28.983
<i>I want to assure everyone
that splicing is safe,</i>

02:29.066 --> 02:32.320
<i>reversible, and, more importantly,
utterly beautiful.</i>

02:32.903 --> 02:35.406
I was the first test subject,
and as you can see

02:35.489 --> 02:37.074
I'm perfectly fine.

02:37.158 --> 02:39.493
Perfectly creepy is more like it.

02:39.577 --> 02:41.996
Him and that whole splicing fad.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.372
This is no simple fad.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.583
Something bad will
come of this splicing.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.627
Something we'll most likely
have to clean up.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.688
Gotcha! Gotcha good!

03:09.982 --> 03:11.901
You are so dead, Matt.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.113
Mom, can I get spliced?

03:16.197 --> 03:17.948
I want to be a real wolfman
for Halloween.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.077
Sorry, Matthew.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.996
No son of mine's going in
for some freaky body treatment.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.581
Aw, come on, Mom.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.824
What about that little relic
from your wild teen years?

03:28.793 --> 03:31.420
Oh, Ter, please.
That's different.

03:31.504 --> 03:33.714
A harmless little tattoo's
hardly comparable

03:33.798 --> 03:35.591
to having antlers
stuck on your head.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.343
Terry doesn't need splicing, Mom,

03:37.426 --> 03:38.928
'cause he's already a donkey!

03:39.011 --> 03:40.011
Hee-haw!

03:45.476 --> 03:47.144
You're lucky I'm late
for school, twit.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.443
Mom, can I get a wolfman tattoo?

04:01.492 --> 04:04.578
<i>As your district attorney,
I 'm making it my top priority</i>

04:04.662 --> 04:07.039
<i>to outlaw splicing completely.</i>

04:07.373 --> 04:09.458
<i>Impartial tests clearly show</i>

04:09.542 --> 04:11.377
<i>a rise in aggressive behavior.</i>

04:17.091 --> 04:19.009
How's that for breaking news?

04:24.515 --> 04:26.434
Nobody can stop splicing.

04:26.517 --> 04:28.517
It's the future, whether
you stinking, scared norms

04:28.561 --> 04:29.812
like it or not.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.523
How about not, snake-boy?

04:33.357 --> 04:36.402
Listen, norm.
Don't even think about dissing us.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.695
Go chew a can.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.113
Huh?

04:49.123 --> 04:52.751
So will you petting zoo rejects
be needing a doctor...

04:52.835 --> 04:54.211
or a vet?

04:59.133 --> 05:01.427
Your time will come, norm.
You'll see.

05:01.594 --> 05:03.596
You'll all see.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.656
I don't know about this, Terry.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.450
Come on, Dana.

05:24.533 --> 05:25.886
You're the one who told me
to keep an open mind

05:25.910 --> 05:26.994
to new things.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.955
Personally, I think
the young lady would look

05:30.039 --> 05:31.707
stunning in spots.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.129
You're smart to come in now.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.757
If my critics have their way,
splicing might go

05:39.840 --> 05:40.966
the way of the dinosaurs.

05:41.425 --> 05:44.011
Not that I don't plan
to fight them tooth and nail.

05:44.386 --> 05:47.431
Yo! We need to see
the doctor. Right now!

05:50.142 --> 05:51.477
Please excuse me.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.654
You know, Ter, as cool as this is,

06:01.737 --> 06:03.113
I just don't know if it's for me.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.825
Te r? Terry?

06:07.535 --> 06:09.453
Gee, thanks for
the swell afternoon, Ter.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.996
I really enjoyed myself.

06:17.086 --> 06:18.462
It's all over the news.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.714
Those scared-o stiffs
are gonna shut us down.

06:21.257 --> 06:23.050
Then we must strike tonight.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.387
The splicers' revolution
cannot be stopped.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.770
If the norms are determined to
drive us underground, so be it.

06:35.479 --> 06:38.148
But we'll take first blood
from the throat of DA Young.

06:38.691 --> 06:40.025
Yeah!

06:48.534 --> 06:50.661
Wayne, I'm in
the Chimera Institute.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.829
<i>Wayne'.!</i>

06:58.419 --> 06:59.461
McGinnis!

07:16.103 --> 07:17.938
What did you just
do to me, Cuvier?

07:18.564 --> 07:21.066
Why, you've been spliced,
of course.

07:21.150 --> 07:22.990
With a little something
I prepared just in case

07:23.068 --> 07:26.488
Gotham's self-appointed defender
ever fluttered into my business.

07:26.572 --> 07:29.283
You see, splicing isn't
just style, Batman.

07:29.366 --> 07:32.995
It's lifestyle, something that
will literally change the world.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.830
Have you considered checking
into Arkham

07:34.913 --> 07:36.332
for a little R&R, doc?

07:36.415 --> 07:38.459
Because, quite frankly,
you're nuts.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.478
You're welcome to your opinions
for the short time

07:40.502 --> 07:42.421
you'll be human enough
to have them.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.386
All right, Cuvier.

07:49.470 --> 07:50.846
Call your freaks off DA Young,

07:50.929 --> 07:53.766
or so help me I'll...

07:55.476 --> 07:56.685
What's the matter, Batman?

07:57.227 --> 07:58.729
Not feeling quite yourself?

08:00.522 --> 08:01.982
Don't worry about the DA.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.068
He's dead meat.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.194
And so are you.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.214
It won't matter.

08:25.631 --> 08:28.050
It's too late for you
to save Young or yourself!

08:33.055 --> 08:34.473
Ah, thanks, hon.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.392
Sam, honey, maybe
you should take a break.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.644
You've been at it
since 5:00 this morning.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.397
Can't be helped.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.482
Putting Cuvier out of business
is going to mean

08:43.565 --> 08:45.234
a lot of long nights.

08:49.738 --> 08:52.908
Right now I just can't relax
knowing that Cuvier

08:52.991 --> 08:56.412
and his guinea pigs are out there,
doing God knows what.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.456
I bet I could relax you.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.590
Evening, Counselor.

09:12.678 --> 09:13.929
Hey, Commish.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.264
Looking good.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.224
But not for long.

09:20.853 --> 09:22.104
Whoa, Sammy.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.189
Your honey's got
some hectic moves.

09:27.151 --> 09:28.569
Too bad she can't stop us

09:28.652 --> 09:30.904
any more than you can stop
Dr. Cuvier's dream.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.116
Break him in half.

09:40.456 --> 09:41.582
Sam!

09:41.665 --> 09:42.665
Get him!

09:53.135 --> 09:55.053
Whoa. What's up with him?

10:13.530 --> 10:14.823
Batman, stop!

10:14.907 --> 10:16.200
You're killing him!

10:23.791 --> 10:25.000
Come on.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.628
That psycho bat will finish
the job for us.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.887
Batman. Terry?

10:37.471 --> 10:38.472
What's gotten into you?

11:04.456 --> 11:05.707
<i>Wayne.</i>

11:05.958 --> 11:07.751
<i>Bruce. It's Barbara.</i>

11:08.043 --> 11:09.043
Is Terry there?

11:09.294 --> 11:11.755
No, I've been trying
to raise him all night, but...

11:11.839 --> 11:13.173
<i>Bruce, listen</i> to me.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.359
<i>There's something
wrong with him.</i>

11:14.383 --> 11:16.301
<i>Something terribly wrong.</i>

11:18.262 --> 11:19.596
<i>Bruce?</i>

11:19.680 --> 11:20.764
<i>Bruce, are you there?</i>

11:29.565 --> 11:30.774
Terry?

11:36.905 --> 11:38.156
Bruce!

11:41.535 --> 11:43.412
Help... me.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.548
Nice to see you, too.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.717
Can't say I blame him.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.886
You roughed us up
before I could cure you.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.181
Cure me? Cuvier!

12:44.264 --> 12:45.641
He spliced me in his lab.

12:46.058 --> 12:49.102
With a massive overdose
of vampire bat serum.

12:49.603 --> 12:52.314
I figured we'd be needing a new
supply of the mutagen antidote,

12:52.731 --> 12:54.524
although it was sooner
than I had expected.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.275
Thanks.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.362
Barbara told me about the attack.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.073
<i>After Batman foiled
the assassination attempt</i>

13:01.156 --> 13:04.326
<i>on DA Young, police raided
the Chimera Institute,</i>

13:04.409 --> 13:07.955
<i>but Dr. Cuvier and his followers
had already gone into hiding.</i>

13:08.038 --> 13:11.833
<i>I can assure you Cuvier
will be found and prosecuted</i>

13:11.917 --> 13:13.251
<i>for this attack.</i>

13:13.335 --> 13:14.795
Cuvier will be deadlier
than ever

13:14.878 --> 13:16.296
now that's he's being hunted.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.468
What's this?

13:21.802 --> 13:22.802
Hmm.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.346
One of Cuvier's claws.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.224
Too bad we can't use it
to find him.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.767
We can't.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.271
Look, wonder-dog,
I don't like you

13:33.355 --> 13:34.690
and you don't like me.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.067
But how about cutting me
a break this one time?

13:39.486 --> 13:41.989
Bad guy. You find. Me stop.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.407
Got it?

13:50.455 --> 13:51.707
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait up!

14:10.183 --> 14:12.561
Please, Doctor.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.646
We tried to kill him,
but Batman was...

14:14.730 --> 14:15.856
Forget Batman.

14:15.939 --> 14:18.066
It was your weakness
that ruined my plans.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.417
All right.
You've gotten us this far.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
I'll take it from here.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.923
Whoa, whoa. Stay! Stay!

14:46.011 --> 14:47.179
Good bat-dog.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.349
Now don't move until I get back.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.355
What is it?

14:58.857 --> 14:59.941
Prey.

15:20.378 --> 15:23.715
We could smell
your human stink a mile away.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.176
What did you do to her?

16:08.927 --> 16:10.428
Let's just say
I put the cat out.

16:11.263 --> 16:13.849
No. I'll never go back
to being a nobody.

16:13.932 --> 16:14.932
You hear me?

16:29.823 --> 16:31.324
Have a dose of reality, pal.

16:31.408 --> 16:32.408
You need it.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.379
I fixed your pets, Doc.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.756
Now it's just you and me.

16:47.299 --> 16:49.718
So why not come on out and fight me,
man to freakshow?

17:08.862 --> 17:09.946
Cuvier?

17:11.781 --> 17:12.824
No longer, Batman.

17:13.325 --> 17:14.910
Now you face a true chimera.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.710
You bring out the beast in me.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.272
Look at me!

17:44.356 --> 17:46.107
The abilities of the entire
animal kingdom

17:46.191 --> 17:47.191
are at my command!

17:47.400 --> 17:50.153
What can one blind little
bat do against that?

17:50.779 --> 17:52.197
The best I can!

18:14.261 --> 18:16.012
The hunt ends, Batman.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.765
Now you die.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.815
Can't control the changing!

18:41.329 --> 18:43.999
What have you done to me?

19:25.040 --> 19:27.042
Don't touch my dog.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.081
Terry?

20:08.875 --> 20:09.918
I'm okay now.

20:10.001 --> 20:12.087
Listen to experience, kid.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.650
I appreciate
what you've done tonight,

20:13.713 --> 20:14.713
but ditch the costume.

20:15.465 --> 20:17.884
You can't live a life
of narrow escapes forever.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.137
It's a thankless existence,

20:21.221 --> 20:23.515
and the rewards are small, if any.

20:24.182 --> 20:27.060
Well, sometimes
the small rewards are the best ones.
