Can we speak later?

00:14.500 --> 00:19.291
Who are you with?
(HESITATING) I'm, uh...
I'm actually on a...

00:19.917 --> 00:20.959
Date.

00:22.291 --> 00:27.250
It's not just that
people don't like  Pucks!
The dog show is killing us.

00:27.250 --> 00:29.000
We had that
cock-sucking dog!

00:29.000 --> 00:30.333
How did we
let it go?

00:30.333 --> 00:33.166
You said, "If anyone
wants to pay for
that piece of shit,

00:33.166 --> 00:34.041
"let them have it."

00:34.959 --> 00:36.208
Sounds like me.

00:36.208 --> 00:38.500
Guess who
dropped by the boys'
school this afternoon.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.792
I give up.

00:39.792 --> 00:42.083
How about
your fucking stalker!

00:42.542 --> 00:44.125
Oh, shit.

00:44.125 --> 00:47.041
If that fucking lunatic
comes near my kids again,
I swear to God...

00:47.458 --> 00:49.250
I came as soon as
I got your message.

00:49.583 --> 00:52.667
I love you so much.
I know.

Ah, fuck.

02:11.792 --> 02:13.083
Does this smell bad?

02:13.500 --> 02:14.792
Oh, yes.

02:14.792 --> 02:17.166
Have you seen this?
No. Should I
throw it out?

02:17.166 --> 02:18.625
Yes, look.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.625
So, so, so.

03:23.625 --> 03:28.291
Sorry to disturb you
last night during
your, uh, date.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.375
It's all right.
No worries.

03:32.375 --> 03:36.667
Oh, good. Phew.
How was it?
The date.

03:38.250 --> 03:42.000
Fine.
Ah, brilliant.
Good. Good.

03:46.041 --> 03:46.917
Would you like to
talk about it?

03:46.917 --> 03:50.041
No. No. No!

03:50.542 --> 03:52.000
All right.

03:59.542 --> 04:01.417
Although...
I was wondering.
Yes?

04:01.709 --> 04:05.875
Um, the date
was with...

04:07.375 --> 04:09.542
Rob. Morning's brother.

04:09.542 --> 04:15.417
Ah-ha. Ah, keeping it
in the family. Smart. Good.
He seems nice.

04:16.375 --> 04:17.250
Mmm.

04:19.375 --> 04:23.542
Where did you go
on the date?

04:24.583 --> 04:27.709
Oh, just to this,
uh, neighborhood

04:37.709 --> 04:40.208
Okay, speaking as
someone who knows
you fairly well,

04:40.709 --> 04:45.542
I'm thinking you're
going to get weirder
before you get less weird.

04:46.208 --> 04:48.667
Uh, you may want
to step away.

04:48.667 --> 04:50.041
Good idea.

(ALL LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

05:29.792 --> 05:33.917
Okay. So, uh, we need you
to sign off on our
sweeps promos.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.834
Also, we should review
the status of the
development slate.

05:36.834 --> 05:40.667
Yeah, yeah. Before that.
I'd like to know,
where's our vampire show?

05:40.917 --> 05:42.208
Our... Our what?

05:42.208 --> 05:43.750
Whoa, am I the only one

05:43.750 --> 05:45.959
who's noticed
that everybody's got
vampires but us?

05:46.333 --> 05:47.917
Not just vampires.

05:47.917 --> 05:49.500
AMC's got
their fucking zombies.

05:50.125 --> 05:51.542
And we've got what?

05:51.542 --> 05:54.500
Well, we've been trying
to stick to your mandate

05:54.500 --> 05:57.291
to only do dramas
"ripped from
the headlines."

05:57.625 --> 05:59.709
Not a lot of zombies
in the headlines.

05:59.709 --> 06:01.208
(ALL LAUGHING)

06:02.000 --> 06:04.166
But let us
get the word out.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.166
We'll call some agents,
get some pitches in.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.166
I don't have
time for that.

06:07.542 --> 06:09.125
I'm gonna have
New York calling
any minute now,

06:09.125 --> 06:10.667
and I need something
that says,

06:10.667 --> 06:14.500
"Hey, forget that
talking dog shit storm
over there! Look over here!

06:14.500 --> 06:15.667
"Werewolves!"

06:15.667 --> 06:17.417
MTV's got werewolves.

06:17.417 --> 06:19.417
So not werewolves!
Help me here!

06:19.417 --> 06:23.333
Well, first of all,
we already have
some terrific projects

06:23.333 --> 06:25.166
you can get them
excited about.

06:25.166 --> 06:26.667
Have you read
Beyond the Roses
yet?

06:27.625 --> 06:28.625
What's  Beyond the Roses?

06:28.875 --> 06:30.625
It's on your desk.
It's that book.

06:31.291 --> 06:34.208
(SCOFFS) A book?
We talked about it.

06:34.208 --> 06:37.417
It's that bestseller
about the family
in the '60s.

06:38.709 --> 06:40.959
It's a beautifully
nuanced portrait...

06:40.959 --> 06:42.625
Oh, wow,
a nuanced portrait.

06:43.625 --> 06:46.333
Look at HBO,
they're up the ass
with nuanced portraits.

06:46.709 --> 06:47.709
What are the
people watching?

06:48.083 --> 06:51.375
Their fucking vampires!
Where are my vampires?

06:51.375 --> 06:54.000
I want ideas,
and I want them now.

06:54.333 --> 06:55.375
Go!
Uh...

06:56.792 --> 06:57.625
Something with mummies.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.041
Mummies? Too slow.

06:59.041 --> 07:00.417
Leprechauns?

07:00.417 --> 07:02.041
Yeah, nothing scarier
than a fucking rainbow.

07:02.583 --> 07:03.583
(STAMMERS)

07:06.083 --> 07:07.625
Come back to me.
Oh, Jesus...

07:08.417 --> 07:09.542
Dragons?

07:10.583 --> 07:11.625
Goblins?

07:12.041 --> 07:13.291
Um, keep going...

07:13.291 --> 07:15.250
Shape shifters?
Lizard men?
Gypsies!

07:15.250 --> 07:17.208
There's probably
a more constructive
way to...

07:17.208 --> 07:19.625
Ogres. Trolls.
Warlocks. Pixies!

07:19.917 --> 07:20.959
Mutants?
Cyborgs?

07:27.792 --> 07:30.417
Gypsies!
Gypsies are real.

07:31.208 --> 07:32.875
I don't think so.

07:45.959 --> 07:49.417
I, uh, I wanted
to apologize
for my behavior earlier.

07:49.959 --> 07:51.125
Oh... No need.

07:51.125 --> 07:54.291
Mmm.
It's a very strange time
for both of us.

07:54.291 --> 07:55.542
Still. I'm the one
who's been saying

07:55.542 --> 07:56.709
there's no going back
for the two of us.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.291
So you dating is
something I should have
seen coming.

08:00.417 --> 08:02.333
I'm sorry
I reacted so poorly.

08:03.125 --> 08:05.625
It's as much
my fault as it is yours.
No, no, no.

08:05.625 --> 08:08.500
No, I should have
warned you
before I went.

08:08.834 --> 08:09.959
Right.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.583
Yeah.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.583
Or just turned your
phone off.

08:14.583 --> 08:17.458
Absolutely.
Good advice
for next time.

08:22.542 --> 08:24.500
What?
Nothing.

08:30.333 --> 08:32.667
Funnily enough, um...

08:33.667 --> 08:35.583
Doesn't "funnily" sound
like it shouldn't be a word?

08:35.583 --> 08:36.667
(LAUGHING)

08:37.625 --> 08:38.667
It's a word.
No, I know, I know.

08:38.667 --> 08:41.834
But it sounds like
I just made it up.
"Funnily."

08:42.583 --> 08:44.500
Seems like it should
involve a funnel.

08:45.750 --> 08:48.667
Anyway, funnily,
I hadn't really thought
about a "next time."

08:48.667 --> 08:51.458
Is there... Is there
a next time in the offing?

08:52.375 --> 08:53.542
Well, funnily...

08:55.458 --> 08:56.959
We're seeing each other
again tonight.

08:56.959 --> 08:58.166
Tonight?

08:58.166 --> 09:01.458
(LAUGHS) I hadn't
seen that coming.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.750
Do you need to
step away again?

09:04.750 --> 09:06.709
I think I do.

09:08.250 --> 09:09.333

Hi, honey, it's Carol Rance.

09:15.875 --> 09:19.458
Crazy, left field question.
Would JJ have any interest

09:19.458 --> 09:22.583
in developing a show
about gargoyles?

Uh-huh.

09:29.208 --> 09:30.667

I'm so, so sorry,

09:30.667 --> 09:32.875

It's New York.

Elliot. Hi. (CHUCKLES)

09:39.625 --> 09:41.083
So how are things
in New York?

09:41.333 --> 09:42.917
I saw you had almost
70 degrees.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.458
And they say
there's no
global warming.

09:45.458 --> 09:46.917
There's no global warming.

09:46.917 --> 09:51.041
Thank you. It's ridiculous.
People, hello,
it's called weather.

09:51.834 --> 09:52.667
So what's up?

09:53.291 --> 09:54.959
I actually just landed in L.A.

09:55.250 --> 09:57.959
Oh. Wow. Welcome!

09:58.291 --> 10:01.625
I was wondering,
you think we could meet
for a drink tonight?

10:01.875 --> 10:03.083
Yup, absolutely.

10:03.083 --> 10:04.750
Let me just make sure
Merc's free.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.375
But I can't imagine...
No.

10:06.917 --> 10:08.792
No, no Merc. Just you.

10:10.291 --> 10:12.250
Uh, sure. All right.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.041
Is everything okay?
Couldn't be better.

10:16.208 --> 10:19.083
Well, great. Great.

10:19.083 --> 10:21.917
Oh, and maybe
don't mention to him
that we're getting together.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.625
Great.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.291
Yeah, totally.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.166
See you, then. Bye.

Facebook friend.

10:49.792 --> 10:51.500
Hey, you.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.625
Or should I say
ex-Facebook friend?

10:53.959 --> 10:55.750
I miss your status.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.625
Aw, that's sweet.

11:00.750 --> 11:03.750
Um, if you'll just
excuse me for a moment.

11:05.125 --> 11:05.917
A moment.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.542

11:16.542 --> 11:18.166
Wait!
Don't go in there!
Why not?

11:18.166 --> 11:21.542
She's in there!
Uh... You know...
(EXCLAIMING)

11:21.542 --> 11:22.834
Yeah, I know.
You know?

11:22.834 --> 11:24.166
She came in
with me today.

11:24.166 --> 11:25.667
Never mind.
She came in with you?

11:25.667 --> 11:28.083
Yeah. It's cool.
I'm guessing
it's many things.

11:28.083 --> 11:30.208
Cool is probably
the one thing it's not.

11:30.208 --> 11:31.333
What's going on?

11:31.333 --> 11:32.917
Apparently, it's Bring Your
Stalker to Work Day.

11:33.208 --> 11:35.333
What?
He's got Labia in there!

11:35.333 --> 11:36.625
What?

11:37.583 --> 11:38.875
Last night I got
really hammered...

11:41.792 --> 11:44.417
And I was feeling
kind of depressed,
so, I don't know,

11:44.417 --> 11:45.834
I guess I called her.
You guess.

11:45.834 --> 11:47.125
Why do you even
have her number?

11:47.125 --> 11:48.208
From the last time
I called her?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.959
Unbelievable.
I know. Even as
I was dialing,

11:50.959 --> 11:52.125
I'm like, "Don't do this!

11:52.125 --> 11:54.834
"You know it's
only gonna bite you
in the ass."

11:55.625 --> 11:56.709
What?
She bit you in the ass?

11:56.709 --> 11:57.709
Little bit.

11:58.709 --> 12:02.458
Okay, fine, I get it.
You're not supposed to
screw your stalker.

12:02.709 --> 12:04.166
And you brought her
to work.

12:04.166 --> 12:06.041
Well, I'm not gonna
leave her alone
in my house.

12:06.291 --> 12:08.125
Oh, of course not.
And where are you going
to put her next?

12:08.125 --> 12:10.041
I don't know.
I'm open to suggestions.

12:10.041 --> 12:12.667
Well, if you put her
in your car, remember to
crack open a window.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.917
A lot of stalkers
have died that way.

12:15.542 --> 12:16.667
Don't worry about it.

12:18.375 --> 12:19.500
Have you thought this
through at all?

12:19.500 --> 12:22.083
What about Diane?
Ah, shit.

when you're trying to
explain this to her?

she's not
a maniac anymore.

out of her."

I hear you.

All right,
I got to get rid of her.

be hard now.

12:36.417 --> 12:37.792

It's not fucked up.
You fucked it up.

you really do have
an inability

12:44.667 --> 12:46.583
to appreciate
the consequences
of your actions.

12:46.583 --> 12:47.667
When did he
tell you that?

12:47.917 --> 12:49.375
When he was
destroying our lives.

12:49.375 --> 12:51.917
Ah, yes. Good times.

12:55.792 --> 12:57.083
Oh, my God.
I know.

12:57.083 --> 13:00.792

self-sabotaging person
I've ever met.

pretty fucked up people.

Rob called,
about tonight.

13:12.500 --> 13:16.041

tell me later.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.250
How much later?
I was kind of hoping
to get out of here early.

I can leave early?

13:24.291 --> 13:25.750

you want the message?

13:25.750 --> 13:27.166
Just give me
the message and go.

Okay. He said to tell you,

13:29.959 --> 13:33.000
"Same time as last night,
same restaurant."

13:35.458 --> 13:36.542
Thank you.

13:37.041 --> 13:38.750
So, I can go?
Fine.

13:46.709 --> 13:47.917

13:50.458 --> 13:53.750
I think I may
take off as well.

How about you?
I, uh, I've got
some stuff to do.

13:58.166 --> 14:00.625
You know, emails,
get organized
for tomorrow.

14:00.625 --> 14:04.375

Have a nice evening.

14:04.375 --> 14:05.667

my phone off tonight.

not be calling.

Are you actually

24:16.166 --> 24:18.291
Genius.
Those puppets...

24:20.667 --> 24:22.250
(EXHALES HEAVILY)

24:22.250 --> 24:23.458
When are you
going to tell him?

24:23.709 --> 24:27.166
I thought I'd wait
till after his
Man of the Year thing.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.291
At least let him
have that.

24:29.041 --> 24:30.458
That's nice.
Also that way,

24:30.458 --> 24:32.291
we can empty out his office
while he's there.

24:35.250 --> 24:39.000
So. We should talk
about the transition.

24:40.750 --> 24:43.125
Can I ask?
Do you know who
you're going to go with?

24:43.625 --> 24:44.959
We've got
a very short list.

24:44.959 --> 24:46.000
Right.

24:46.625 --> 24:48.625
And your name's
at the top of it.

24:55.834 --> 24:57.625
(DOOR OPENING)

25:00.959 --> 25:02.667
Okay.

25:03.834 --> 25:05.375
You see all that marble?

25:06.458 --> 25:09.125
That's me.
What do you mean it's you?

25:10.792 --> 25:12.875
It's not marble.
It's all faux.

25:14.041 --> 25:15.291
Faux?
Mmm-hmm.

25:16.250 --> 25:19.208
Oh, my God!
You painted all this?

25:19.208 --> 25:20.875
Well, me and my crew.

25:21.542 --> 25:24.375
You big, fat liar!

25:25.583 --> 25:27.458
"I paint houses."

25:28.083 --> 25:29.667
You're a bloody genius!

25:30.583 --> 25:31.792
Well, that's not true.

25:32.542 --> 25:35.000
(SCOFFS)
The hell it's not.
This is amazing!

25:36.375 --> 25:38.834
And this is actually
someone's house?

25:39.333 --> 25:41.667
Can you believe it?
No!

25:41.959 --> 25:43.250
Who's going to live here?

25:43.250 --> 25:46.375
Oh, I don't know.
They don't even tell
me their names.

25:47.250 --> 25:50.166
My crew and
I just call them
The Bullshits.

25:50.166 --> 25:51.583
Todd and Holly Bullshit.

25:52.792 --> 25:56.291
So their children are
"The Little Shits"?

25:56.291 --> 25:58.000
Yes! That's them!

26:01.041 --> 26:04.166
All faux?
Mmm.
All faux.

26:07.750 --> 26:10.542
You really
are amazingly talented.

26:10.542 --> 26:11.583
You do know that.

26:11.583 --> 26:14.458
I'm okay.
It's not art, art.

26:14.458 --> 26:17.667
Uh, I've seen
a lot of art, art.

26:18.542 --> 26:19.875
I'd be willing to bet

26:19.875 --> 26:22.291
that the paintings
The Bullshits hang
on these walls

26:23.375 --> 26:25.875
will not be nearly
as good as what you're
doing underneath them.

26:26.917 --> 26:27.750
You're very sweet.

26:28.208 --> 26:29.875
Actually I'm not.

26:29.875 --> 26:32.208
You should speak
to some people
who know me.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.709
No, I'm sticking
with sweet.

26:52.750 --> 26:54.709
Okay.

26:56.709 --> 26:59.291
You all right?
Yup, I am.

27:01.667 --> 27:04.542
That was lovely.
A little troubling.

27:05.417 --> 27:08.375
Troubling...
Because it was lovely.

27:08.375 --> 27:09.792
Oh!

27:10.792 --> 27:14.125
What can I say?
I'm a mess.
You're allowed to be.

27:16.458 --> 27:18.333
See, you're the sweet one.

27:22.166 --> 27:24.250
When I came to this country

27:24.250 --> 27:28.750
a few months ago,
I was happily married...

27:29.667 --> 27:32.959
I hadn't kissed another man
in 10 years.

27:32.959 --> 27:37.625
And I never had
a doubt as to
what I was feeling.

27:41.125 --> 27:41.959
And now?

27:44.041 --> 27:45.583
Haven't a clue.

27:46.291 --> 27:49.792
But whatever it is,

27:50.667 --> 27:54.792
funnily,
it's definitely not

27:56.208 --> 27:57.291
faux.

27:57.792 --> 27:58.834
Hmm.

28:03.417 --> 28:06.291
Oh, and now
we're doing it again.
