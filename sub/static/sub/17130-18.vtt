WEBVTT

00:00.768 --> 00:04.072
Ã³RALE, LAZY SUSAN.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.175
IT'S NOT YOUR BREAK TIME.
GET BACK TO WORK.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.676
THERE ARE NO PARTS TO INSPECT

00:08.676 --> 00:10.844
'CAUSE ERNIE'S
SLOWING DOWN THE LINE.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.313
(snoring)

00:17.085 --> 00:21.089
YOU MIGHT WANNA
WAKE UP QUEEN LATINA.

00:24.092 --> 00:25.159
(click)

00:25.159 --> 00:28.629
(gasps)
IS THE TOAST READY?

00:28.629 --> 00:30.731
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'
SLEEPIN' ON THE JOB?

00:30.731 --> 00:33.334
OH, I'M--I'M SORRY, GEORGE.
I JUST SAT DOWN FOR A MINUTE

00:33.334 --> 00:36.337
TO REST MY KNEES.
I GUESS I MUST HAVE NODDED OFF.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.439
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THEY'RE BOTHERING ME SO MUCH.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.674
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO LISTEN TO YOUR BODY,

00:40.674 --> 00:42.676
AND RIGHT NOW,
YOUR KNEES ARE SCREAMIN'

00:42.676 --> 00:45.045
"YOU'RE CRUSHIN' US!
EAT A SALAD!"

00:45.045 --> 00:47.915
SO I GAINED
A COUPLE OF POUNDS.

00:47.915 --> 00:50.184
A COUPLE OF POUNDS?
YOU'RE HUGE.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.620
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT WANNA
CHECK YOUR BELLY BUTTON.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.822
I THINK I SAW A CAT CRAWL
UNDER THERE TO HAVE KITTENS.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.525
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

00:57.525 --> 01:00.328
YOUR SORE KNEES
ARE SLOWIN' DOWN PRODUCTION.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.663
YOU KNOW, ERNIE, MAYBE
IF YOU LOST A FEW POUNDS...

01:02.663 --> 01:04.665
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M DOING FINE, ALL RIGHT?

01:04.665 --> 01:06.667
IF ANYTHING'S
SLOWING ME DOWN,

01:06.667 --> 01:08.669
IT'S YOU ASKING ME QUESTIONS
WHILE I HAVE WORK TO DO.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.671
NOW LEAVE ME ALONE.
VÃ¡MANOS!

01:10.671 --> 01:14.308
I GOTTA GO PICK UP A LOAD
WITH MY FORKLIFT.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.310
IS IT YOUR LUNCH?

01:16.310 --> 01:18.879
YOU'D BETTER TAKE THAT BACK.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.581
DON'T EAT ME, PLEASE!

01:22.082 --> 01:24.518
HEY, MOM, EASE UP ON ERNIE.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.720
OH, WHAT DO YOU CARE?
I'M THE MANAGER,

01:26.720 --> 01:28.322
AND IT'S MY JOB
TO DEFEND THE WORKERS.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.324
YOU NEVER DEFENDED ME.

01:30.324 --> 01:33.694
THAT'S NOT TRUE. I CLEANED
THE STALL IN THE MEN'S ROOM

01:33.694 --> 01:35.263
WHERE ALL THAT NASTY STUFF
WAS WRITTEN ABOUT YOU.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.830
WHAT DID IT SAY?

01:36.830 --> 01:39.032
I DON'T REMEMBER.
I WROTE IT A LONG TIME AGO.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.001
(horn honks)

01:41.001 --> 01:43.471
AAH! AAH!

01:43.471 --> 01:45.439
ERNIE!

01:45.439 --> 01:47.040
(gasps)

01:47.040 --> 01:48.409
(man) ERNIE.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.178
(man) OH, MY GOD.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.549
MAN!

01:55.549 --> 01:57.185
WHEN ERNIE
WANTS MINI DOUGHNUTS,

01:57.185 --> 01:59.187
THERE'S NO STOPPING HIM,
HUH?

02:01.289 --> 02:03.624
HEY.
HUH?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.626
HOW COULD YOU LOSE CONTROL
OF THE FORKLIFT?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.628
WELL, I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.630
THE STEERING WHEEL
JUST LOCKED UP ON ME.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.633
GOD, I BET PEOPLE
ARE ALREADY MAKING JOKES

02:12.633 --> 02:15.203
ABOUT ME HITTING
THE VENDING MACHINE.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.171
NO. I SAID,
"NO ONE MAKES JOKES

02:17.171 --> 02:19.072
ABOUT MY FRIEND
IN MY FACTORY."

02:19.072 --> 02:22.276
BUT Â¿SABES QUÃ©? THEY'RE GOIN'
CRAZY IN THE PARKING LOT.

02:23.811 --> 02:27.481
BOBBY SAID IF YOU DIE,
HE WANTS DIBS ON YOUR TUSKS.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.251
HEY, ERNIE, HOW YOU DOIN'?

02:30.251 --> 02:32.453
OH, I'M FINE.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.121
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE ACCIDENT, MEL.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.224
OH, DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT IT,
BUDDY. YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:36.224 --> 02:38.025
ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.594
WE CAN REPLACE THAT VENDING
MACHINE AND THE FORKLIFT,

02:40.594 --> 02:42.596
BUT WE CAN'T REPLACE YOU.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.532
THANKS A LOT, MEL.
(Mel) ALL RIGHT.

02:46.099 --> 02:48.936
TIME TO REPLACE LARD-O.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.238
WHAT?

02:50.238 --> 02:52.039
THE GUYS IN THE SHOP
CHECKED THE FORKLIFT.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.041
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE STEERING WHEEL.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.143
ERNIE COULDN'T TURN THE WHEEL
BECAUSE HIS GUT IS TOO BIG.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.145
THAT'S RIDICULOUS, MEL.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.947
LOOK, HIS GUT
MIGHT BE BIG ENOUGH

02:59.947 --> 03:02.015
TO ACCIDENTALLY PUSH BUTTONS
ON THE COPIER...

03:02.015 --> 03:04.485
BUT IT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH
TO JAM A STEERING WHEEL.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.420
HOW MANY COPIES?
500.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.522
AY.
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.524
IF WE CAN'T FIND LARRY'S CAT,
IT'S NOT BECAUSE

03:10.524 --> 03:13.261
WE DIDN'T GET THE WORD OUT.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.263
NO, IT'S NOT JUST
THE ACCIDENT.

03:15.263 --> 03:18.131
HE'S GOTTEN TOO BIG
TO DO HIS JOB. FIRE HIM.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.133
MEL, YOU JUST CAN'T
FIRE SOMEBODY

03:20.133 --> 03:21.435
FOR BEING OVERWEIGHT.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.437
NO, MY LAWYER SAID
THAT IF ERNIE

03:23.437 --> 03:25.239
IS SLOWING DOWN PRODUCTION
AND WRECKING EQUIPMENT,

03:25.239 --> 03:29.109
THOSE ARE UNDUE BURDENS,
AND I CAN FIRE HIM FOR THAT.
OKAY,

03:29.109 --> 03:30.711
THEN YOU CAN'T FIRE SOMEBODY
WITHOUT GIVING HIM A WARNING.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.013
LOOK, ERNIE'S
ONE OF OUR BEST EMPLOYEES.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.948
GIVE HIM A CHANCE
TO LOSE THE WEIGHT.
HE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO DO THAT.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.217
THESE FATTIES
HAVE NO SELF-CONTROL.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.019
THEY'RE JUST WEAK PEOPLE.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.221
OH, COME ON, MEL.
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.156
I MEAN,
YOU'RE AN ALCOHOLIC.

03:43.156 --> 03:47.160
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
SOMEBODY IN THE MEETING TALKED?

03:47.160 --> 03:49.162
MARGARET F. IN ACCOUNTING?

03:49.162 --> 03:50.964
'CAUSE, WHOA,
WHEN SHE'S DRINKIN',

03:50.964 --> 03:53.233
THAT "F" ISN'T
FOR "FAITHFUL," MY FRIEND.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.968
(George) JUST GIVE ERNIE
SOME TIME, OKAY?

03:54.968 --> 03:58.539
I GIVE YOU MY WORD.
HE'LL LOSE THE WEIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.474
I'LL GIVE HIM A MONTH
TO LOSE 20 POUNDS,

04:00.474 --> 04:02.876
BUT IF HE DOESN'T,
HE'S OUTTA HERE.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.812
DON'T WORRY, MEL.
I'LL WHIP HIM INTO SHAPE.

04:04.812 --> 04:09.883
BY THE END OF THE MONTH, HEY,
HE'LL BE BACK DOWN TO A "C" CUP.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.754
YOU CAN'T MOTIVATE ANYONE.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.756
ERNIE'S NOT GONNA
LOSE THAT WEIGHT.

04:15.756 --> 04:20.594
I JUST NEED TO THINK OF A WAY
FOR HIM TO KILL HIS APPETITE.

04:20.594 --> 04:24.498
MOM, YOU HAVE ANY
NAKED PICTURES OF YOURSELF?

04:25.899 --> 04:27.801
THAT LAST ONE TASTED
LIKE HOT DOG.

04:29.403 --> 04:32.540
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

04:36.243 --> 04:38.111
* ALL MY FRIENDS

04:38.111 --> 04:41.482
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

04:43.083 --> 04:45.686
* THE LOW RIDER

04:45.686 --> 04:48.322
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

05:03.937 --> 05:07.174
HEY, GEORGE.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.976
WELL, I'M GLAD TO SEE

05:08.976 --> 05:11.078
THE ACCIDENT DIDN'T HURT
YOUR APPETITE.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.714
OH, HOMBRE, IT WAS LIKE
A WAKE-UP CALL.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.816
I REALIZE
HOW PRECIOUS LIFE IS.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.719
YOU GOTTA SAVOR IT.
WATCH OUT.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.789
THAT'S GREAT, ERNIE,

05:21.789 --> 05:23.791
BUT DO YOU
HAVE TO DEEP FRY LIFE

05:23.791 --> 05:25.993
AND DIP IT
IN BLUE CHEESE DRESSING?

05:25.993 --> 05:30.297
THIS IS RANCH, SMARTASS.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.400
ERNIE,
YOU GOTTA STOP EATING, MAN.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.470
I MEAN, PEOPLE AT THE FACTORY
ARE ASKING ME WHEN YOU'RE DUE.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.606
MAN, I KNOW
I'M A LITTLE HUSKIER,

05:38.606 --> 05:40.608
BUT I'M HAPPY WITH WHO I AM.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.576
BESIDES, IT'S NOT WHAT'S
ON THE OUTSIDE THAT COUNTS.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.745
IT'S WHAT'S
ON THE INSIDE, HMM?

05:44.745 --> 05:46.747
YEAH, AND BEAUTY'S
ONLY SKIN DEEP,

05:46.747 --> 05:48.749
AND SIZE DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU KNOW WHO SAYS THAT?

05:48.749 --> 05:51.952
UGLY PEOPLE, VATO,
WITH TINY CHURROS.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.023
YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA QUIT MAKING
FUN OF PEOPLE'S APPEARANCES.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.493
THERE'S NOT A HAT IN THE WORLD
THAT WOULD FIT THAT HEAD.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.729
OH, THAT WAS MEAN.

06:01.729 --> 06:05.065
I THOUGHT YOU PEOPLE
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE JOLLY.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.802
MAN, LOOK,
YOUR PRODUCTIVITY'S DOWN,

06:08.802 --> 06:11.839
AND YOU CRASHED A FORKLIFT
BECAUSE YOUR STOMACH'S TOO BIG.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.607
LOOK...

06:13.607 --> 06:15.609
MEL TOLD ME HE'S GONNA
GIVE YOU A MONTH

06:15.609 --> 06:17.678
TO LOSE 20 POUNDS
OR YOU'RE OUT OF A JOB.

06:17.678 --> 06:20.548
I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM
TRY AND FIRE ME.

06:20.548 --> 06:23.216
I'LL SUE.
I'LL OWN THE PLANT.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.985
WHY ARE YOU MAKIN' SUCH
A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS, MAN?

06:24.985 --> 06:26.987
LOSE A FEW POUNDS.
IT'LL BE GOOD FOR YOU.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.390
NO, GEORGE. I'M TIRED
OF EVERYONE PUSHING ME AROUND.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.060
ENOUGH'S ENOUGH.
IT'S TIME I PUSHED BACK.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.862
FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE,

06:34.862 --> 06:38.098
I'M GONNA STAND UP
FOR MY OWN DIGNITY.

06:42.970 --> 06:46.807
YOUR SHIP HAS SAILED
ON THIS DIGNITY THING.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.764
GOD, THERE WAS A WHOLE CAKE
HERE THIS MORNING.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.701
WELL, ERNIE'S COMING OVER,
AND WE WANT HIM TO LOSE WEIGHT.

07:13.701 --> 07:16.570
SO I NEED TO GET RID
OF ALL THE FATTENING FOOD.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.572
WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO EAT IT.

07:18.572 --> 07:23.210
WHY DON'T YOU JUST HIDE IT?
THIS IS FOR ERNIE!

07:23.210 --> 07:26.680
HE HAS NO SELF-CONTROL.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.850
NOW GO TO THE STORE.
I WANT ICE CREAM.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.724
YOU KNOW,
IF I CLOSE MY EYES,

07:36.724 --> 07:40.961
I COULD SWEAR A LITTLE GIRL
IS PUNCHING THIS BAG.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.730
COME ON.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.732
VISUALIZE SOMETHING
THAT REALLY ANNOYS YOU,

07:44.732 --> 07:46.700
AND HIT IT
AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

07:46.700 --> 07:50.504
I WANT TO,
BUT THE BAG'S IN THE WAY.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.208
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING?

07:55.208 --> 07:57.110
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA
WATCH A GAME.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.112
OH, I'M TAPIN' IT.
I THOUGHT MAYBE

07:59.112 --> 08:01.048
WE COULD THROW A FEW PUNCHES.
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OVER?

08:01.048 --> 08:02.650
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.451
REMEMBER, PACE YOURSELF, HUH?

08:04.451 --> 08:08.989
START WITH A COUPLE OF JABS,
THEN THROW IN SOME COMBINATIONS.

08:08.989 --> 08:09.990
ALL RIGHT.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.126
(grunting)

08:13.126 --> 08:15.929
(gasping)

08:17.464 --> 08:19.833
NOW TAKE IT EASY.
THAT'S CONNECTED TO THE HOUSE.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.969
YOU'RE GONNA BRING
THE WHOLE THING DOWN.

08:23.671 --> 08:27.274
GEORGE, HE'S NEVER GOING
TO GET A WORKOUT THIS WAY.

08:27.274 --> 08:30.110
WORKOUT? HEY, I CAME
OVER HERE TO WATCH A GAME.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.681
WHAT, ARE YOU GUYS TRYING
TO TRICK ME INTO EXERCISING?

08:33.681 --> 08:35.482
WHY, WOULD THAT
MAKE YOU MAD ENOUGH

08:35.482 --> 08:37.785
TO CHASE ME AROUND THE BLOCK
THREE TIMES A WEEK BEFORE WORK?

08:37.785 --> 08:40.788
CUT IT OUT.
I DON'T WANNA EXERCISE.

08:40.788 --> 08:43.190
LOOK, ERNIE, YOU GOTTA
DO SOMETHIN', MAN.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.893
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
AS HEAVY AS YOUR MOM.
HEY, WATCH IT NOW.

08:47.561 --> 08:52.199
ERNIE, YOUR MOTHER
IS MORBIDLY OBESE.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.735
YOU INHERITED HER GENES.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.737
IF YOU DON'T EXERCISE
AND EAT BETTER,

08:56.737 --> 08:59.907
YOU'RE HEADED FOR DIABETES
AND HEART DISEASE.

09:01.441 --> 09:04.144
YOU KNOW, YOU TWO
WOULD BE IN A WORLD OF HURT

09:04.144 --> 09:06.113
IF I HADN'T JUST UNLEASHED
ON THAT BAG.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.850
HEY, AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I ALREADY TALKED TO A LAWYER,

09:09.850 --> 09:11.852
AND HE SENT A LETTER
TO THE POWERS BROTHERS

09:11.852 --> 09:14.622
SAYING THAT IF THEY FIRE ME,
I'M GONNA SUE 'EM

09:14.622 --> 09:16.890
FOR WRONGFUL TERMINATION.
ERNIE,
YOU CAN'T WIN IN COURT, OKAY?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.626
MEL'S GOT A REAL LAWYER...

09:18.626 --> 09:23.563
NOT A GUY WHO'S ADVERTISING
ON THE SAME BUS HE'S RIDING ON.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.901
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU WERE REALLY MY FRIEND,

09:27.901 --> 09:29.703
YOU'D ACCEPT ME
THE WAY I AM,

09:29.703 --> 09:31.705
'CAUSE WHEN I LOOK
AT THE TWO MIRRORS

09:31.705 --> 09:34.675
THAT I PUT UP SIDE BY SIDE
AT MY HOUSE,

09:34.675 --> 09:36.677
I'M OKAY WITH WHAT I SEE.

09:36.677 --> 09:40.080
WHO WANTS A NICE,
HEALTHY SNACK OF CARROTS?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.281
NICE TRY.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.382
WHAT?

09:42.382 --> 09:43.717
YOU'RE PUSHING CARROTS,

09:43.717 --> 09:46.453
BUT YOU GOT CAKE
IN YOUR TEETH.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.889
YOU'RE A HORRIBLE HOST.

09:51.224 --> 09:51.825
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:51.825 --> 09:53.026
(door slams)

09:53.026 --> 09:55.028
COULDN'T GET THROUGH
TO ERNIE.

09:55.028 --> 09:58.231
AH, IT'S HOPELESS.
I'VE HAD PATIENTS LIKE THAT.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.567
THEY FILL THEIR EMPTINESS
WITH GREASY FRENCH FRIES

10:00.567 --> 10:02.736
AND DEEP FRIED ONION RINGS,

10:02.736 --> 10:06.940
BACON CHEESEBURGERS
DRIPPING WITH SATURATED FAT,

10:06.940 --> 10:08.208
AND...

10:08.208 --> 10:11.945
I'M GONNA MAKE A RUN.
ANYONE WANT ANYTHING?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.983
DAD, YOUR BOSS IS HERE.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.189
MEL, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

10:22.189 --> 10:24.191
HEY, I JUST GOT A LETTER
FROM ERNIE'S LAWYER

10:24.191 --> 10:26.760
ACCUSING ME OF BEING PREJUDICED
AGAINST FAT PEOPLE.

10:26.760 --> 10:30.030
DOES NO ONE REMEMBER
HOW BIG MY SECOND WIFE WAS?

10:30.030 --> 10:32.032
OH, YEAH, I REMEMBER CHERYL.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.034
SHE WORE THAT GREEN DRESS
TO THE CHRISTMAS PARTY,

10:34.034 --> 10:35.969
AND YOU FIRED THAT GUY

10:35.969 --> 10:37.971
WHO ACCIDENTALLY
PUT AN ORNAMENT ON HER.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.373
GEORGE, I WANT YOU
TO FIRE ERNIE.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.242
COME ON, MEL.
ERNIE'S A GREAT WORKER.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.144
SAVE IT, ALL RIGHT? YOU GAVE HIM
A WARNING, AND INSTEAD

10:44.144 --> 10:46.279
OF LOSING THE WEIGHT,
HE TURNS AROUND AND HE SUES ME.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.281
NO, I DON'T WANNA SEE ERNIE
AT THAT FACTORY AGAIN.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.784
BUT THIS JOB IS ALL HE HAS,
MEL. HE'S GONNA BE CRUSHED.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.086
ALL RIGHT, DO WHAT I DID
TO MY SECOND WIFE--

10:53.086 --> 10:56.523
WRITE "YOU'RE OUTTA HERE"
ON A CAKE.

10:56.523 --> 11:00.227
THAT WAY, SHE WAS ABLE
TO GET GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.798
WELL,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

11:04.798 --> 11:07.267
WELL, I THINK I CAN GET MEL
TO CHANGE HIS MIND

11:07.267 --> 11:09.269
IF I COULD GET ERNIE
TO DROP THE LAWSUIT.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.171
BUT HE STILL
HAS TO LOSE THE WEIGHT.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.173
WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'M GONNA GET HIM TO DO THAT.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.908
I MEAN, HE WON'T EVEN ADMIT
HE HAS A PROBLEM.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.910
IT'S A DEFENSE MECHANISM.

11:16.910 --> 11:20.380
ERNIE'S EATING EMOTIONALLY
TO COVER UP SOME PAIN.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.950
THE QUESTION IS...

11:22.950 --> 11:25.385
WHAT IS ERNIE'S PAIN?

11:25.385 --> 11:28.989
HE'S NOT MARRIED.
HE DOESN'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.324
IT'S GOTTA BE
THAT HE'S LONELY.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.194
THE IRONY IS,
THE MORE HE EATS,

11:34.194 --> 11:36.964
THE LESS ATTRACTIVE
HE BECOMES TO WOMEN.

11:36.964 --> 11:40.868
(gasps) THAT'S IT!
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.870
SUBCONSCIOUSLY,
HE'S EATING TO REJECT WOMEN

11:42.870 --> 11:45.005
BEFORE THEY REJECT HIM.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.140
IT'S A SELF-FULFILLING
PROPHECY.

11:48.909 --> 11:52.846
YOU KNOW, THERE MIGHT BE
AN EMOTIONAL REASON BEHIND THIS.

11:52.846 --> 11:56.716
YOU DIDN'T HEAR
A WORD I SAID.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.752
SHH!

11:58.752 --> 12:00.988
I THINK I'M ONTO SOMETHING.

12:08.095 --> 12:11.098
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOIN' TO
THE PLACE NEXT DOOR FOR LUNCH.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.100
LATER. I NEED A NEW SUIT.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.102
HEY, AND IF YOU DON'T
LISTEN TO ME

12:15.102 --> 12:17.370
AND TAKE MEL TO COURT,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED ONE, TOO.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.372
OH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
ALL I GOT

12:19.372 --> 12:22.242
IS MY LUCKY PURPLE SUIT
FROM PROM.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.411
LUCKY? YOU WENT
WITH YOUR COUSIN

12:24.411 --> 12:27.414
AND SHE GAVE BIRTH
IN THE BATHROOM.
(laughs)

12:27.414 --> 12:30.784
CAN I HELP YOU GENTLEMEN?
UH, WE'RE LOOKIN'
FOR A COUPLE OF SUITS.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.920
NOW I KNOW WHAT I WANT,

12:32.920 --> 12:36.123
BUT MY FRIEND HERE MIGHT NEED
SOME HELP.
ARE WE SHOPPING
FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION?

12:36.123 --> 12:37.590
WELL, I MIGHT BE IN COURT,
YEAH.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.326
I'LL BE STANDIN' UP THERE
FOR MY RIGHTS,

12:39.326 --> 12:42.295
AND MY MAN HERE WILL BE
RIGHT BESIDE ME. (laughs)

12:42.295 --> 12:44.264
OH, GOOD FOR YOU.
THEY'LL TAKE OUR TAXES,

12:44.264 --> 12:48.068
BUT THEY WON'T LET US
WALK DOWN THE AISLE. (laughs)

12:48.068 --> 12:51.204
UM, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT, MAN.
WE'RE NOT GAY.

12:51.204 --> 12:55.408
THAT'S A WEIRD THING TO JUST
BLURT OUT LIKE THAT, GEORGE.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.544
WHAT SIZE PANTS
DO YOU WEAR?

12:57.544 --> 13:00.380
OH, WELL, UM,
NOW I USED TO BE A 36,

13:00.380 --> 13:02.582
BUT I GAINED
A FEW POUNDS SINCE THEN.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.485
SO I GUESS I'M A 38, 40.

13:05.485 --> 13:09.122
AND WHAT SHALL WE BE DOING
WITH THE OTHER LEG?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.324
HEY, MAN, IF MY FRIEND
SAYS HE'S A 40,

13:11.324 --> 13:13.526
THEN HE'S A 40.
GET HIM A 40.

13:13.526 --> 13:14.862
OKAY.

13:14.862 --> 13:18.665
I GOT A 40 OVER HERE.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.533
YOU RIP IT, YOU BUY IT.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.969
GIMME THOSE!

13:23.370 --> 13:27.274
I'LL LOOK AROUND FOR PANTS
IN A DIFFERENT STYLE.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.281
(pants rip)

13:35.482 --> 13:40.153
(Ernie) I THINK
I JUST BOUGHT THESE!

13:40.153 --> 13:42.722
DON'T SWEAT IT, MAN.
THEY RUN SMALL.

13:42.722 --> 13:46.559
THESE ARE ONE SIZE BIGGER.
TRY THESE.

13:51.231 --> 13:54.667
OH, NOW WE'RE TALKIN'.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.569
DO THEY FIT?

13:56.569 --> 13:58.371
YEAH, THESE FEEL GOOD.

13:58.371 --> 14:01.641
IT'S LIKE
THEY WERE MADE FOR ME. YEAH.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.843
WELL, I GUESS I'M GONNA
HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT

14:03.843 --> 14:05.578
THAT I'M A 42 NOW.

14:05.578 --> 14:09.249
ERNIE, I BROUGHT THOSE.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.251
THOSE ARE YOUR MOM'S PANTS.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.253
THEY'RE A 50, MAN.
MEL TOLD ME TO FIRE YOU.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.422
YOU'RE OBESE
AND YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.192
WELL, I KINDA MEANT
TO SPACE THAT OUT,

14:19.192 --> 14:21.528
BUT, WELL, YOU KNOW,
HERE WE ARE.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.837
OH, MY GOD.

14:30.837 --> 14:34.641
THESE ARE
MY MOM'S CHURCH PANTS...

14:34.641 --> 14:38.045
AND THEY FIT ME.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.047
I DON'T WANNA RUB IT IN,

14:40.047 --> 14:43.050
BUT THEY LOOK A LITTLE TIGHT
IN THE WAIST.

14:43.050 --> 14:48.221
I'M WEARING FAT LADY PANTS.
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

14:48.221 --> 14:50.390
DUDE, OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO,
YOUR STOMACH

14:50.390 --> 14:55.095
IS THE BIGGEST BEEF PROCESSING
PLANT IN THE COUNTRY.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.530
I TRIED TO STOP EATING,
BUT I COULDN'T.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.599
EVER SINCE I MOVED OUT
OF MY PARENTS' HOUSE,

14:59.599 --> 15:01.601
I JUST STARTED GAINING
ALL THIS WEIGHT.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.536
YOU KNOW, ERNIE, YOUR LIFE WAS
SUPPOSED TO GET BETTER

15:03.536 --> 15:05.605
WHEN YOU GOT
YOUR OWN BACHELOR PAD--

15:05.605 --> 15:09.176
GIRLS BY THE POOL, PARTIES...
NO GIRL
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN ME.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.178
WELL, NOT NOW.
YOU MADE SURE OF THAT.

15:11.178 --> 15:14.547
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LOOK, YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
AFRAID OF WOMEN REJECTING YOU.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.549
WHEN YOU WERE LIVIN'
WITH YOUR PARENTS,

15:16.549 --> 15:18.551
YOU USED THAT
AS YOUR EXCUSE.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.520
WHEN YOU MOVED OUT,
YOU NEEDED ANOTHER ONE.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.522
SO WHAT DID YOU DO, MAN?
YOU GAINED SO MUCH WEIGHT

15:22.522 --> 15:24.691
THAT YOU GUARANTEED
THAT WOMEN WOULD REJECT YOU.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.826
I WAS EXPLAINING THIS
TO ANGIE YESTERDAY.

15:26.826 --> 15:31.764
IT'S CALLED A SELF-FULFILLING
PROPHYLACTIC.

15:31.764 --> 15:36.069
THAT MAKES SENSE.
I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT.

15:40.940 --> 15:45.678
GOD, LOOK AT ME.
I'M SUCH A LOSER.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.581
YOU'RE NOT A LOSER.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.250
MAN, YOU'RE A GOOD GUY
WITH A GREAT HEART

15:50.250 --> 15:54.621
THAT HAPPENS TO BE WORKIN'
ITS ASS OFF RIGHT NOW.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.823
HOW AM I EVER GONNA
LOSE 20 POUNDS

15:56.823 --> 15:58.091
BY THE END OF THE MONTH?

15:58.091 --> 16:00.660
LOOK, I'M GONNA HELP YOU,
OKAY?

16:00.660 --> 16:02.462
WE'LL WORK OUT TOGETHER.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.464
I GOT YOUR BACK
NO MATTER WHAT, ERNIE.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.500
HEY, IF KIRSTIE ALLEY CAN
KINDA DO IT, THEN SO CAN YOU.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.636
THANKS, GEORGE.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.638
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA START TODAY.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.940
YEAH, I'M GONNA
HAVE A SALAD FOR LUNCH,

16:13.940 --> 16:15.642
AND THEN
I'M GONNA GO FOR A JOG.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.010
YEAH, WELL, LET'S START
WITH SOME SPEED WALKING.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.511
I'M NOT TOO FAT TO JOG.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.513
IT'S NOT THAT. THESE PANTS
YOU RIPPED COST $200.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.283
MOVE IT. YOU'RE IN TRAINING.
ALL RIGHT.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.917
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:24.917 --> 16:28.388
IT'S THE SOUND OF ALL THESE
ZIPPERS. I GOTTA GET HIM HOME.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.027
(knock on door)

16:34.027 --> 16:36.529
HEY, GEORGE.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.531
I CALLED MEL.
YOU READY TO WEIGH IN?

16:38.531 --> 16:40.233
HEY, NO PROBLEM.
WATCH OUT.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.070
* I GOT THIS

16:43.070 --> 16:44.337
(laughs)

16:44.337 --> 16:46.339
YEAH, LAST NIGHT,
I WEIGHED MYSELF.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.741
I LOST 22 POUNDS
IN ONE MONTH.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.377
DID YOU CELEBRATE?

16:50.377 --> 16:53.213
YEAH, I SURE DID. I DOUBLED
MY PORTION OF CAULIFLOWER.

16:53.213 --> 16:57.750
MMM. THAT WAS GOOD, YEAH.
VEGETABLES, FRUITS--

16:57.750 --> 17:01.054
MM-MMM, I CAN'T GET ENOUGH
OF THOSE. (laughs)

17:01.054 --> 17:03.856
(crying)
I MISS PIZZA SO MUCH.

17:03.856 --> 17:08.561
AND FRIED CHICKEN
AND PIE...
HEY, ERNIE.

17:08.561 --> 17:11.698
AND GRAVY
AND MASHED POTATOES.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.600
HEY, HERE'S ONE OF YOUR CARROTS.
LOOK, EAT ONE OF YOUR CARROTS.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.871
ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE HAD
YOUR MONTH. LET'S DO THIS.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.342
REMEMBER, ANYTHING LESS THAN
20 POUNDS AND YOU'RE OUTTA HERE.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.144
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
BE PROUD OF ME, MEL.

17:24.144 --> 17:27.214
YEAH, I'VE BEEN DIETING
AND WORKING OUT HARD.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.149
I THINK YOU'RE IN
FOR A BIG SURPRISE.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.884
YEAH, NOT AS BIG A SURPRISE
AS THAT SCALE'S IN FOR.
WHAT?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.220
HUH?
OH.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.056
WHAT'S IT SAY?

17:37.056 --> 17:41.228
HANG ON,
IT'S STILL SPINNING. (laughs)

17:41.228 --> 17:43.463
HEY, HE LOST 17 POUNDS.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.698
THAT'S ALMOST 20.
ISN'T THAT GREAT, MEL?

17:45.698 --> 17:49.436
ALMOST MAY WORK WITH HORSESHOES
AND LANDING GEAR...

17:49.436 --> 17:51.238
BUT NOT WHEN
YOU MADE A PROMISE.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.706
I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.176
I'VE BEEN WORKIN' OUT HARD.
I COUNTED CALORIES.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.944
THIS IS THE HARDEST THING

17:57.944 --> 17:59.746
I EVER HAD TO DO
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.182
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT WERE YOU WEARING

18:02.182 --> 18:04.184
LAST NIGHT
WHEN YOU WEIGHED YOURSELF?

18:04.184 --> 18:06.519
OH, I WAS NAKED.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.556
I BET IF I TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF,
I'LL MAKE IT FOR SURE.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.758
OH, WHOA! THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.761
WELCOME BACK, ERNIE.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.763
HEY, GEORGE, THANKS, MAN.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.665
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU.

18:18.665 --> 18:21.033
OKAY, JUST REMEMBER,
YOU GOTTA KEEP IT UP, OKAY?

18:21.033 --> 18:22.702
YOU GOTTA STAY STRONG.

18:22.702 --> 18:23.903
HEY, WATCH OUT...

18:23.903 --> 18:25.172
* I GOT

18:25.172 --> 18:27.474
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT,
TAKE IT EASY.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.512
CONGRATULATIONS
ON LOSING THE WEIGHT, ERNIE.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.514
YOU KNOW,
THERE IS A POOL THAT SAYS

18:34.514 --> 18:37.417
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO KEEP IT OFF.
ARE YOU IN ON IT?

18:37.417 --> 18:39.419
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

18:39.419 --> 18:43.256
YOUR HEALTH IS WORTH
MORE TO ME THAN $50.

18:43.256 --> 18:46.593
OOH. OH, LOOK AT THIS...

18:46.593 --> 18:52.265
SOMEONE HAS PICKED THE LOCK
ON THE NEW VENDING MACHINE.

18:52.265 --> 18:56.169
WHY, A FELLA COULD EAT
ANYTHING HE WANTS.

18:56.169 --> 18:59.506
(George) ERNIE!

19:02.342 --> 19:03.876
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:03.876 --> 19:05.712
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

19:07.680 --> 19:12.151
WHY DO THOSE DRAPES
GIVE YOU STRENGTH?

19:12.151 --> 19:15.488
BACK TO WORK, BAT.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.326
HEY, ERNIE.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.727
(Ernie) HEY.

19:22.662 --> 19:27.667
SELF-FULFILLING
PROPHYLACTIC.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.203
UM, NANCY, UH...

19:30.203 --> 19:32.805
I WAS WONDERIN' IF YOU WEREN'T
DOIN' ANYTHING THIS WEEKEND,

19:32.805 --> 19:35.908
MAYBE WE COULD...
YOU KNOW WHAT? NEVER MIND.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.382
YO, NANCY. FRIDAY, 8:00,

19:42.382 --> 19:44.584
DINNER, YOU AND ME.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

19:44.584 --> 19:45.552
OKAY.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.958
SHE SAID YES!

19:51.958 --> 20:04.871
HEY, HEY, DON'T JUMP.
WE'RE ON A FAULT LINE.
