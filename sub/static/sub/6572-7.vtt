00:02.068 --> 00:05.003
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.105 --> 00:07.505
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.507
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.115 --> 00:16.776
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.152 --> 00:22.144
<i>Michael Bluth paid an
unexpected visit to his mother.</i>

00:22.255 --> 00:24.382
- You look pretty, Mom.
- What do you need?

00:24.491 --> 00:27.016
- Need? Why do you think I need something?
- Well, you're too busy for us.

00:27.127 --> 00:29.527
No one's seen you.
Going on all those dates with Rita.

00:29.629 --> 00:33.963
- Or should I say playdates?
<i>- Michael had recently dated a woman...</i>

00:34.067 --> 00:36.558
<i>he later found out
was mentally challenged.</i>

00:36.669 --> 00:39.194
We're not seeing each other anymore,
but it's...it's for the best.

00:39.305 --> 00:41.205
I'm actually kind of relieved it's over.

00:41.307 --> 00:44.640
<i>Actually, Michael
had been so devastated by their break-up...</i>

00:44.744 --> 00:49.875
<i>that he'd even broken out the old guitar.</i>

00:56.289 --> 00:59.383
- Maybe you should talk to someone.
- Like my mom?

00:59.492 --> 01:02.052
I don't know.
Does she play guitar?

01:02.162 --> 01:04.959
Can't a guy call his mom pretty
without it seeming strange?

01:05.065 --> 01:08.193
Amen. And how about that
little piece of tail on her?

01:08.301 --> 01:10.929
- Cu-ute!
- I've opened a door here that I regret.

01:11.037 --> 01:13.505
Oh, he's just talking about
his stupid turtle.

01:13.606 --> 01:16.074
- Oh.
- She has a name, Mother. And it's "Mother."

01:16.176 --> 01:18.770
<i>Buster had recently brought home a turtle...</i>

01:18.878 --> 01:22.473
<i>in an incredibly misguided attempt
to make his mother jealous.</i>

01:22.582 --> 01:26.712
You can stay in this box
that Uncle-father Oscar left behind.

01:26.820 --> 01:30.654
<i>- In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally
obtained medical marijuana.</i> - Oh, good.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.749
- Hey, it's already got grass.
<i>- Primo bud. Real sticky weed.</i>

01:33.860 --> 01:37.421
Although I was getting a little worried because
she was moving really slowly last week...

01:37.530 --> 01:40.761
and then she stopped.
Hmm.

01:40.867 --> 01:43.768
Yeah. Well, in any event I'm here,
Mom, because you need me.

01:43.870 --> 01:47.067
As you know the Bluth Foundation dinner
is a week away.

01:47.173 --> 01:51.303
I am your co-chair,
and we don't wanna relive the TBA debacle.

01:51.411 --> 01:54.005
<i>Years earlier, the Bluths had a hard time...</i>

01:54.114 --> 01:57.606
<i>agreeing on a cause
for their foundation's first fund-raiser.</i>

01:57.717 --> 02:01.153
"Herpes." "Shrinkage."

02:01.254 --> 02:04.280
Somebody saw <i>Seinfeld</i> last night.

02:04.390 --> 02:08.690
"Neck flap."
"Ovarian cancer." Gee, I wonder who that was?

02:09.895 --> 02:11.625
- One more for "neck flap."
- Yes.

02:11.731 --> 02:14.529
Well, I'll be honest. I haven't
heard anything that beats herpes.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.898
<i>So, they sent out invitations with the disease...</i>

02:17.003 --> 02:18.903
<i>still "to be announced."</i>

02:19.005 --> 02:24.170
<i>And much to their surprise,
the Bluths ended up raising over $25,000...</i>

02:24.277 --> 02:26.438
<i>to fight TBA.</i>

02:26.546 --> 02:28.912
<i>And then...
and here's the really horrible part...</i>

02:29.015 --> 02:31.449
<i>they did it again
the following year.</i>

02:31.551 --> 02:34.987
Keep fighting, little guy.
With your support of the Bluth Foundation...

02:35.088 --> 02:39.252
we'll live in a galaxy
where TBA does not exist.

02:39.359 --> 02:42.692
When people at the last gala found out,
we almost had a riot on our hands.

02:42.795 --> 02:46.356
Well, you don't have to worry
about anything like that this year, because...

02:46.466 --> 02:49.264
Warden Gentles is the new co-chair.

02:49.369 --> 02:52.668
- The guy who ran Dad's prison?
- He's here now installing cameras...

02:52.772 --> 02:55.104
because of all your father's escape attempts.

02:55.208 --> 02:59.304
Uh, yeah. It looks like I won't be goin' anywhere
for a little while. But what do I care, huh?

02:59.412 --> 03:02.939
I got a beautiful wife.
I got a wonderful hobby. Ha! Look at me.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.949
I'm having the time of my life.

03:05.051 --> 03:07.952
<i>His hobby was making papier-mâché copies...</i>

03:08.054 --> 03:12.047
<i>- of his own head.</i> - Before I forget,
do you know if these cameras are high def?

03:12.158 --> 03:17.061
I certainly hope so. It'll help me
better understand "George Bluth"...

03:17.163 --> 03:23.102
the main character of the latest and, I pray,
final draft of my screenplay, <i>New Warden.</i>

03:23.203 --> 03:25.865
- You wrote a screenplay, huh?
- I promised myself I wasn't gonna become...

03:25.972 --> 03:28.873
one of those people who are always going on
about their screenplays...

03:28.975 --> 03:33.935
so I'll just say, I put together a staged reading
with some fabulous young actors...

03:34.047 --> 03:36.015
and it was very well received.

03:36.115 --> 03:38.743
<i>Warden Gentles had convinced
his granddaughter's teacher...</i>

03:38.851 --> 03:41.581
<i>to mount</i> New Warden
<i>as a school play.</i>

03:41.688 --> 03:44.623
- I understand you've been causing problems.
- Nobody sells any coke...

03:44.724 --> 03:47.215
in this pen
without daddy getting a taste.

03:47.327 --> 03:50.387
Beat him with a pillowcase
full of batteries.

03:50.496 --> 03:54.432
Ward's letting us hold the event
in the new wing of the prison.

03:54.534 --> 03:58.470
After lockdown, everyone's going
to spend the night in a cell.

04:01.507 --> 04:03.407
Are they color or black and white?

04:03.509 --> 04:08.446
So, Michael, I don't need your help at all...
unless you need something from me?

04:08.548 --> 04:13.451
No. I'm fine. Just thought I could help.
Relieved I don't have to.

04:13.553 --> 04:17.579
<i>But he wasn't relieved.
So he went home to complain to his sister, Lindsay.</i>

04:17.690 --> 04:20.557
Prison's the last thing we want people
associating with the Bluth name.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.094
- Plus, who's gonna want to go?
- Wait, this is gonna be at the prison?

04:23.196 --> 04:25.687
Oh, great.
Probably gonna run into that warden.

04:25.798 --> 04:28.289
- How do you know the warden?
- Oh, right.

04:28.401 --> 04:30.926
Uh, he spoke at my school
for a "Startled Straight" assembly.

04:31.037 --> 04:33.471
<i>Actually, she'd met with him in the hopes...</i>

04:33.573 --> 04:36.770
<i>of using his prison
as a location for a film.</i>

04:36.876 --> 04:42.337
I think you will find the desert
both engrossing... and high grossing.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.507
So we don't get dessert.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.585
I guess I have some reading to do.

04:46.686 --> 04:50.952
Besides I doubt very much Mom's come up
with a real disease to have a fund-raiser for.

04:51.057 --> 04:53.355
I forgot. We have a real disease.
I chose it:

04:53.459 --> 04:56.656
GVH, "Graft Versus Host."

04:56.763 --> 04:59.493
It's new, it's fatal,
and guess who's got it?

04:59.599 --> 05:02.067
You've heard of bodies
rejecting transplants.

05:02.168 --> 05:05.626
Well, in this case, your transplanted hair
is rejecting your body.

05:05.738 --> 05:07.638
Either you remove your hair graft...

05:07.740 --> 05:10.504
or the host, you, will get
sicker and eventually die.

05:10.610 --> 05:15.013
- Can you think of any benefits?
- Benefits? No. He'll die.

05:15.114 --> 05:18.675
Oh, oh, yeah. No, I... I get that.
But have there ever been any fund-raisers?

05:18.785 --> 05:23.381
A husband with the headlining disease.
Everyone's gonna wanna talk to me.

05:23.489 --> 05:27.186
- You're making him keep the hair?
- Did you see the attention Superman's wife got?

05:27.293 --> 05:29.591
- Besides, Tobias wants it too.
- Oh, she's right.

05:29.696 --> 05:32.290
Th-This is gonna be great for me,
because I am gonna star...

05:32.398 --> 05:34.491
in the video Gob's making for the gala.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.228
Oh, yeah.
It'll be very uplifting.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.669
- Oh, here, let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

05:39.772 --> 05:41.672
Oh. Oh, this is gonna hurt. Oh!

05:43.976 --> 05:47.177
You know what? We're gonna
need this from another angle.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.612
- And you're sure you're okay?
- Oh, probably.

05:49.716 --> 05:52.150
I can't feel anything.
How's my hair?

05:52.251 --> 05:55.084
It's fine.
It's sucking the life out of you, Tobias.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.316
I mean, everything's gone crazy...
the gala, Mom and Warden Gentles.

05:58.424 --> 06:00.892
I mean, what is in it for him?
I think he's taking advantage of Mom.

06:00.993 --> 06:03.894
And did it ever occur to you
that maybe Warden Gentles likes her?

06:03.996 --> 06:08.865
- Likes her what?
- No, I... I mean, likes her, like, is attracted to her.

06:08.968 --> 06:12.768
- Who's the "her" in that sentence?
- Mom. Warden Gentles likes Mom.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.898
- Her?
- I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this.

06:16.008 --> 06:19.273
The guy runs a prison.
He can have any piece of ass he wants.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.813
And if he likes her in that sense,
it makes it even worse.

06:21.914 --> 06:24.974
I don't want Mom mixed up with the sort of creep
that would have her as a fetish.

06:25.084 --> 06:27.814
Oh, Michael, you're just feeling
neglected by your mother.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.820
You wanted to go to this with her,
didn't you?

06:29.922 --> 06:32.254
Hey, I... I don't need
to take my mom to a gala, okay?

06:32.358 --> 06:34.383
Only losers go to those things
with their parents.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.792
- I'm going with my son.
- Oh, I may skip that. I don't like galas.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.330
<i>Actually, he loved galas.</i>

06:39.432 --> 06:43.334
<i>- All kids do.</i> - Oh, come on.
Don't leave your Uncle Tea Bag hangin'.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.996
- Please don't call yourself that.
<i>- What he was having trouble with...</i>

06:46.105 --> 06:48.801
<i>was looking directly at his dying uncle.</i>

06:48.908 --> 06:52.400
I can't stand by and watch Mom get hurt.
I gotta get down there.

06:52.512 --> 06:56.346
This is heartbreaking.
Gotta get this for the video.

06:56.449 --> 06:59.418
George Michael, you wanna put your head
down there by his drainage shunt?

06:59.519 --> 07:03.717
<i>Buster, meanwhile,
was also feeling abandoned by Mother.</i>

07:03.823 --> 07:07.919
Mo... Mother! I have no one now.

07:08.027 --> 07:12.088
<i>But at that very moment,
his true father returned.</i>

07:12.198 --> 07:15.190
Uncle-father Oscar,
what are you doing here?

07:15.501 --> 07:20.204
Well, you know me. I could
never leave a little bud behind.

07:20.306 --> 07:25.334
Oh, a hug. Nice. You haven't seen
a little box with a turtle on it, have you?

07:25.445 --> 07:29.279
Oh, yeah. My turtle was living in it
before he ate all the grass and died.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.282
- He ate all the grass?
- Yeah.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.443
- It's been great catching up.
- W-W-Wait, where you going?

07:33.553 --> 07:36.613
No, I can't stay,
because if my brother finds out that I'm here...

07:36.722 --> 07:40.818
he's gonna try switching places again,
and I can't go back to prison.

07:40.927 --> 07:43.657
- If my father comes in, you can hide
in one of Gob's tricks. - I can't.

07:43.763 --> 07:48.632
- At least you can stay and help me bury
my poor turtle. - Or we could cremate it.

07:48.734 --> 07:53.137
<i>And Maeby was having a harder time finishing
Warden Gentle's screenplay than he did.</i>

07:53.239 --> 07:57.471
How'd you like to read something fun that
we could talk about on the way to the prison gala?

07:57.577 --> 08:01.809
Oh, I'm actually gonna sit that out.
I'm just burnt out on prisons lately.

08:01.914 --> 08:04.075
- Well, this might change your mind.
- Is that a screenplay?

08:04.183 --> 08:06.310
Well, that's what you're gonna tell me.

08:06.419 --> 08:09.320
<i>And Michael raced to warn his mother
of the warden's intentions.</i>

08:09.422 --> 08:11.322
- Hey! You can't park there.
- Oh, sorry.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.915
- I'm sorry.
- No stairs. No parking.

08:14.826 --> 08:17.826
Sorry.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.065
Everything looks delicious.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.533
Oh, One-Eye's a wonderful chef.

08:23.636 --> 08:28.096
I've had to go to his parole hearings twice
and lie through my teeth to keep him here.

08:29.207 --> 08:31.665
Hi, I just, um...

08:31.777 --> 08:34.245
Wow.
What are you guys doing?

08:34.347 --> 08:38.784
It's perfectly innocent, but I can see
how if our roles were reversed...

08:38.885 --> 08:42.446
I might have you beaten
with a pillowcase full of batteries.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.455
- I'll give you two a moment.
- Thank you.

08:44.557 --> 08:47.617
I don't know why I always assume
that everyone's read my screenplay.

08:47.727 --> 08:51.163
What is wrong with you?
That man is being wonderful to us.

08:51.264 --> 08:54.700
And that doesn't concern you, Mother?
For all you know he could be trying to seduce you.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.200
- Oh, Michael, you're crazy.
- I certainly hope so.

08:57.303 --> 09:00.602
I'm trying to seduce him.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.970
- Who's the "I" in that sentence?
- Me.

09:03.075 --> 09:06.044
- You?
<i>- Her.</i>

09:10.550 --> 09:14.577
<i>Michael had just discovered that
his mother was interested in another man.</i>

09:14.687 --> 09:18.783
- Mom wants to sleep with the warden.
- What? Oh, God!

09:18.891 --> 09:22.054
- Great. - Great? The man is old enough
to be her contemporary, Lindsay.

09:22.161 --> 09:25.562
Plus, she's married, okay? She can't be
writhing around underneath the covers...

09:25.665 --> 09:29.066
- What is wrong with you? It's disgusting! God!
- Take it easy.

09:29.168 --> 09:31.966
No, it's just I've always had a thing
about Mom and Dad being together.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.596
- I know that.
- I have a sense of propriety, my God.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.766
- Gob, we've had this conversation.
- When?

09:36.876 --> 09:40.243
- The last time you ended up seeing Mom
and Dad go at it. - What? No! God, Michael!

09:40.346 --> 09:43.782
- I did no such thing.
<i>- He did very much that thing...</i>

09:43.883 --> 09:47.478
<i>when his parents got intimate
in a conjugal trailer two years ago.</i>

09:47.587 --> 09:49.612
<i>But thankfully,
he'd found a way to forget that.</i>

09:49.722 --> 09:54.352
I got a thing of pills in my pocket. I don't suppose
I could convince you to grab me one.

09:54.460 --> 09:57.623
<i>- Luckily, that worked too.</i>
- I can't even hear this.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.755
You may not like it
that Mom has needs...

09:59.865 --> 10:02.026
but it never bothered you
when Dad was running around.

10:02.134 --> 10:05.537
- Well, that was different. - Well, how 'bout
when she was sleeping with Uncle Oscar?

10:05.638 --> 10:07.538
The guy looks just like Dad.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.666
I don't know. He's family.
It seemed very natural they'd be together.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.643
Who? What? What is natural?
Is there new legislation on this now?

10:13.746 --> 10:17.682
<i>George Michael was concerned about
family love after reading Maeby's script...</i>

10:17.783 --> 10:22.516
<i>- which he took as a subtle message to him
from his cousin.</i> - Listen, new fish.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.590
That bunk was open
because the last guy...

10:24.690 --> 10:26.988
wouldn't do the things
that you're going to do.

10:27.093 --> 10:32.121
- We're going to... do things? - Anything
can happen when two people share a cell, coz.

10:32.231 --> 10:35.200
Um, I'll go...
Okay, I'll go with you to the prison.

10:35.301 --> 10:40.136
George Michael, what I want you to do is run
upstairs and run a nice bath for Uncle Tobias.

10:40.239 --> 10:43.868
And I want you to help him get in the tub.
Can you do that for me? Thanks.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.672
And don't make the water too hot.
The scabs come right off.

10:46.779 --> 10:49.577
<i>Come on, Lindsay. What are we gonna do about Mother?
- Honestly, Michael...</i>

10:49.682 --> 10:53.618
all this "Mother" talk...
you're starting to sound a lot like Buster.

10:53.719 --> 10:55.983
<i>And Michael realized there was somebody else...</i>

10:56.088 --> 10:57.988
<i>in the family who would care about this.</i>

10:58.090 --> 11:01.491
Buster's gonna take this so hard.
I cannot let my brother get hurt.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.494
Oh!

11:10.136 --> 11:13.573
Oh, it's on standby. Got another one in you?

11:14.674 --> 11:17.336
<i>Buster, meanwhile,
was enjoying being with Oscar.</i>

11:17.443 --> 11:19.934
<i>But Oscar was longing
for his sweet freedom.</i>

11:20.046 --> 11:25.348
Say, you don't have any Sweet Freedom or Tropical
Ease or any of the Hawaiian blends, do you?

11:25.751 --> 11:27.749
Someone's coming.

11:27.853 --> 11:31.584
Oh, Dad, get in the cage
and hide behind the mirror. It'll look empty.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.821
<i>Oscar never got a chance
to hide behind the mirror.</i>

11:36.128 --> 11:38.226
<i>Although it was not the first time...</i>

11:38.330 --> 11:40.730
<i>he was knocked out
by a powerful lid.</i>

11:40.833 --> 11:45.202
Hey, Buster, listen.
I got some bad news about Mom.

11:45.304 --> 11:48.137
She's planning on spending the night
with another man.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.708
- Gob?
- N-No. Not another brother.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.938
- Oh. Then why do we care?
- What is wrong with everyone?

11:54.046 --> 11:57.243
Uh, B-Buster, you've got to talk to Mom
about this. She can't possibly do it.

11:57.349 --> 12:00.477
- If Dad finds out, he'll go berserk.
- If Dad finds out about what?

12:00.586 --> 12:04.022
Oh. Well, I guess I've got no choice now.
Dad, I-I've got some bad news...

12:04.123 --> 12:08.787
about Mom and Warden Gentles...
dating.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.692
Oh. Better sit down.

12:12.797 --> 12:15.096
Okay, what's the news?

12:15.201 --> 12:18.728
- They're dating.
- Oh, yeah. Because she's... she's my wife.

12:18.838 --> 12:21.432
- Oh, yeah. Damn it!
- I'm surprised you're not more upset about this.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.940
When you first told me,
but you see, time... time passes.

12:24.043 --> 12:27.240
Besides, it's only, uh, dinner in the office.
I mean it's not Le Cirque.

12:27.346 --> 12:30.440
- How'd you know that it was in his office?
- Well, wh-where...

12:30.549 --> 12:33.575
where the hell else are they gonna go
at 4:00 in the afternoon?

12:33.686 --> 12:35.517
It was around 4:00.
You already know about this.

12:35.621 --> 12:37.088
- Come on.
- You're up to something, right?

12:37.189 --> 12:39.453
- No.
- You both are. She's workin' the warden.

12:39.558 --> 12:42.823
- You're makin' fake heads. You're planning
an escape. - How dare you?

12:42.928 --> 12:45.988
I oughta shave your head and make you
sit under that camera all night, mister.

12:46.098 --> 12:50.091
It's unbelievable. You know, I was worried that
this guy was gonna take advantage of Mom.

12:50.202 --> 12:55.105
You both were taking advantage of him. I don't
know why I work to keep this family together.

12:55.207 --> 12:57.004
Michael, can I talk to you
for one sec?

12:57.109 --> 13:02.206
<i>- And that's when George Sr. got a call from Lucille.</i>
- Three, two, two, five, two.

13:03.515 --> 13:05.510
Howdy doody, that's it.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.246
Now, y-you get back here
so you can smuggle me out...

13:08.354 --> 13:10.322
past the guards
before Michael starts blabbing.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.720
You know what?
You can smuggle yourself out.

13:12.825 --> 13:15.020
You wanna get away from me so bad?
You're free.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.391
But I'm free too, baby.

13:17.496 --> 13:21.023
I'm staying in the conjugal trailer
with the warden tonight.

13:22.902 --> 13:24.802
Him?

13:24.904 --> 13:29.238
- Hey, why is there an ambulance out front?
- Honey, the car is here.

13:29.341 --> 13:32.139
Hey, do you need a ride?
I mean, you'll have to lie down, but...

13:32.244 --> 13:36.112
I'm not goin'. The whole thing is a scam.
Mom was using that warden to try to get Dad out.

13:36.215 --> 13:38.945
- She's not trying to seduce him at all.
- Oh, no. She is.

13:39.051 --> 13:41.884
She's spending the night with him.
She just called to ask me to bring her...

13:41.987 --> 13:46.048
a tube of "Vagis-table" paste.
Hi, George Michael.

13:46.158 --> 13:49.423
- You're goin' too, huh?
- Yeah. I thought I would, um, just go with Maeby...

13:49.528 --> 13:52.361
and support her through this whole
Graft Versus Host thing.

13:52.464 --> 13:55.399
<i>And Michael himself was feeling a little like...</i>

13:55.501 --> 13:58.095
<i>the host that the grafting family
was rejecting.</i>

13:58.204 --> 14:03.540
Good. Great. Go. It's a very important cause.
So I'll just stay here and read.

14:03.642 --> 14:07.772
<i>But this, too, would prove challenging
as the family had no books.</i>

14:11.283 --> 14:15.014
<i>Other than those.
And that's when Michael got a glimpse...</i>

14:15.120 --> 14:18.385
<i>into the warden's true intentions
with his mother.</i>

14:18.490 --> 14:22.927
You were just using me to get even
with the man who broke out of your prison?

14:23.028 --> 14:25.087
That escape cost me my promotion.

14:25.197 --> 14:29.133
And you will pay for
the loss of $2,300 a year.

14:29.235 --> 14:32.136
But you gave me presents.
We made love.

14:32.238 --> 14:38.143
I've given you one last present.
Enjoy the chlamydia, Lucille. Ha, ha, ha.

14:38.244 --> 14:41.771
Take this newly diseased
woman to the hole. Ha.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.645
I wish I'd read
<i>The Man Inside Me.</i>

14:48.754 --> 14:50.745
<i>George Sr. needed to escape...</i>

14:50.856 --> 14:54.758
<i>but his handmade replica
would never fool the cameras.</i>

14:54.860 --> 14:59.456
<i>So he searched through Gob's magic stuff
to find something that might.</i>

14:59.565 --> 15:03.899
- Well, that was a freebie. - Hey, Gob, I'm glad
you're here. I thought you'd be at the gala.

15:04.003 --> 15:06.403
Yeah, Dad made me move my stuff
outta Buster's room.

15:06.505 --> 15:09.235
<i>But only after hiding himself in the cage...</i>

15:09.341 --> 15:11.775
<i>to get past the cops at the door.</i>

15:11.877 --> 15:15.074
- Go. - Mom's being set up.
We have to get into that prison.

15:15.180 --> 15:18.149
- It's after lockdown. - Come on, Gob.
You were gonna break out of this place once.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.617
- I know you can help me break in.
- It's not a Jamba Juice, Michael.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.915
It shouldn't be that hard to break into.

15:24.023 --> 15:29.017
<i>And Buster returned only to find
no evidence of his uncle-father.</i>

15:29.128 --> 15:31.255
Hey, Father-uncle Dad...

15:31.363 --> 15:33.263
I was just bringin' some juice for my pet.

15:33.365 --> 15:36.766
Wait a minute.
You're not really smiling.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.303
I'm Oscar. He did it again.

15:39.405 --> 15:44.206
I told you he would.
I can't go through this again. I can't be caged!

15:44.310 --> 15:49.577
<i>And Buster realized
he needed to give his true father his freedom.</i>

15:49.682 --> 15:53.516
- Hey! Let's get him!
<i>- But it was a freedom that didn't last long.</i>

15:53.619 --> 15:56.179
<i>And as the prison gala was underway...</i>

15:56.288 --> 15:58.381
<i>the guys arrived for their break-in...</i>

15:58.490 --> 16:01.857
<i>with the help of one of George Sr.'s
instruments of escape.</i>

16:01.961 --> 16:05.897
- You think this is gonna work?
- It's a jet pack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong?

16:05.998 --> 16:09.525
- All right. - Now just make sure you tell me
before you hit any buttons...

16:13.238 --> 16:15.729
- Good. Now we know what the strap is for.
- Okay.

16:15.841 --> 16:17.741
- Under the crotch. Yup.
- We need a new plan.

16:17.843 --> 16:22.246
- Wish I knew the layout of this place.
- Way ahead of you, Michael.

16:22.348 --> 16:26.011
Drew a map of it on my stomach.
It's upside down, so it might be a little awkward.

16:26.118 --> 16:28.245
<i>- It was awkward.</i>
- I drew us.

16:28.354 --> 16:31.050
- I think we're, like, right there.
- Hey, guys.

16:31.156 --> 16:35.388
- If you're gonna party, you wanna bring it inside?
- That was a freebie.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.587
Well, the new facility isn't so bad, huh?

16:37.696 --> 16:39.596
It's a lot like school,
only it's air-conditioned.

16:39.698 --> 16:43.464
So I guess we can just, uh... just choose a cell
to stay overnight in and, uh...

16:43.569 --> 16:47.300
Oh, great. And you can take me through
your thoughts about the screenplay beat by beat.

16:47.406 --> 16:52.002
Sure. Yeah. "Because anything can happen
when two people share a cell, coz."

16:52.111 --> 16:55.376
It's a line from...
from <i>New Warden.</i>

16:55.481 --> 17:00.180
Oh. Oh! Okay, yeah.
I don't know what I was worried about.

17:00.285 --> 17:03.083
<i>That would be the happiest moment...</i>

17:03.188 --> 17:05.748
<i>George Michael
would ever experience in his life.</i>

17:07.226 --> 17:10.752
<i>- And the warden was happy too.</i>
- What a treat.

17:10.863 --> 17:15.027
The man who cost me my promotion
ends up back in my care.

17:15.134 --> 17:20.127
And I don't think there's going to be
an "I'm Oscar" Web site this time.

17:20.239 --> 17:23.696
Think this time I'll do a podcast.

17:23.809 --> 17:27.142
"Graft Versus Host."
Sounds like a tennis match...

17:27.246 --> 17:30.215
between Steffi Graf
and <i>Happy Days</i> star Donny "Host."

17:30.315 --> 17:32.545
<i>- It's "Most."</i>
- But it's far deadlier.

17:32.651 --> 17:34.710
Hello. I'm Gob Bluth.

17:36.221 --> 17:39.384
As a magician,
I can make a lot of things disappear.

17:39.491 --> 17:42.221
There are some things
I can't make disappear...

17:42.327 --> 17:45.728
no, not that candy ball machine...

17:45.831 --> 17:48.561
the disease GVH without your help.

17:48.667 --> 17:51.761
This is Tobias.
When Toby first came into the family...

17:51.870 --> 17:54.100
none of us much wanted him around...

17:54.206 --> 17:56.766
but that's because we couldn't see
what was on the inside.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.606
But lately, that's all we've been able to see.

18:00.712 --> 18:02.710
But what was Tobias to do...

18:03.115 --> 18:05.743
Have his hair plugs removed?

18:05.851 --> 18:09.252
The doctor says I'd be completely healed
if I were to do that.

18:09.354 --> 18:13.120
- He just needs his hair plugs out?
- Doctor says that's the cure.

18:13.225 --> 18:17.457
- There's a cure? - No way. That horsehair
is my ticket back into society.

18:17.563 --> 18:20.589
You cut it after those idiots at the gala
accept me as one of their own.

18:20.699 --> 18:23.361
We're giving money for this guy
to keep his hair transplants?

18:23.469 --> 18:25.629
I'd rather give to TBA!

18:26.138 --> 18:28.504
<i>The crowd began to grow unruly.</i>

18:28.607 --> 18:31.269
We have a riot in the ballroom.

18:31.376 --> 18:33.970
<i>And, just as the prisoners had proven...</i>

18:34.079 --> 18:36.513
<i>they could throw a gala
as well as the rich...</i>

18:36.615 --> 18:40.551
<i>so the rich proved they could throw a riot
just as well as the prisoners.</i>

18:40.652 --> 18:44.281
<i>- And Lucille was brought to the conjugal trailer.</i>
- Mom.

18:44.389 --> 18:46.823
- Michael, what are you doing?
- I cannot let you go through with this.

18:46.925 --> 18:49.485
- You can't sleep with him.
- Oh, yes I can.

18:49.595 --> 18:52.962
I'm making up for the heartbreak
your father has caused me. He doesn't need me.

18:53.065 --> 18:56.796
- You don't need me.
- Of course I need you, Mom.

18:56.902 --> 19:00.360
My heart is kind of broken too.
I've been kind of denying it lately, but...

19:00.472 --> 19:02.838
um, you know, it just... I can't...
I can't deal with the fact...

19:02.941 --> 19:05.375
that my family's falling apart,
now that I really need you.

19:05.477 --> 19:10.380
Oh, Michael, honey.
I wanna cry so bad...

19:11.583 --> 19:13.813
but I don't think
I can spare the moisture.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.718
Well, listen. Here's...

19:17.823 --> 19:20.758
The problem is that, uh,
Gentles doesn't really care for you.

19:20.859 --> 19:24.386
He's just using you to get back at Dad for escaping,
at least according to his screenplay.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.157
- You read it?
- Yeah.

19:26.265 --> 19:30.065
- Did you like the chlamydia thing? I gave him that.
- You gave <i>him</i> chlamydia?

19:30.169 --> 19:34.833
- He had "crabs," and I said, "You're gonna get laughs."
- Then what am I doing?

19:34.940 --> 19:39.138
I mean, if Dad doesn't care, there's...
there's no real threat...

19:39.244 --> 19:41.678
and, I guess,
just knock yourself out, huh?

19:41.780 --> 19:44.010
Where's Gentles? I'll kill him!

19:44.116 --> 19:46.175
- George? - Dad?
- I can't let you do this.

19:46.285 --> 19:52.019
I can't let what we have...
as lousy as it may be at times... be destroyed.

19:52.124 --> 19:55.355
This is where you escaped to?
To prison? For me?

19:55.460 --> 19:58.395
No one is breaking this family apart.
No one.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.624
You know what?
I think I needed to hear that.

20:00.732 --> 20:05.435
Sorry about the wait.
George? If you're here...

20:05.504 --> 20:07.404
who do we have
in the delousing tank?

20:07.506 --> 20:10.339
- I'm guessing Oscar.
- No.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.706
I cannot take another $2,300 hit.

20:12.811 --> 20:16.804
I'll tell you what: You let Oscar out,
and you give us an hour in here...

20:16.915 --> 20:20.612
and, uh, we'll call it even.

20:22.087 --> 20:24.146
Please, Ward?

20:24.256 --> 20:29.888
I can't say no to the woman
who gave me "chlamydia." One hour.

20:32.364 --> 20:34.628
Are you ready to have some fun?

20:34.733 --> 20:39.261
- I am <i>so</i> glad I didn't cry.
- That I didn't need to hear.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.974
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.201
