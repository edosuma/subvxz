00:06.273 --> 00:07.506
SAM: <i> Previously on</i> Aquarius...

00:07.508 --> 00:11.176
I thought I had a way
to get you out,
but I don't.

00:11.178 --> 00:12.277
Don't go, Dad.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.179
-Good-bye, Walt.
-Don't go.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.214
It's a dangerous
assignment.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.349
We've been trying
to infiltrate the SDS.

00:17.351 --> 00:21.487
One of those anti-war,
anti-everything
protest groups.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.654
No one will hire you.

00:22.656 --> 00:23.922
No one? (CHUCKLES)

00:23.924 --> 00:25.624
Your father-in-law
has made it his business

00:25.626 --> 00:28.694
to speak with your
entire client list.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.029
What do you want here?

00:30.031 --> 00:31.463
A divorce.

00:33.134 --> 00:33.565
GARY: Mescaline.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.601
If you don't have
any money right now,
that's all right.

00:35.603 --> 00:36.902
Your friend needs help.

00:36.904 --> 00:37.603
You have a beautiful soul.

00:37.605 --> 00:41.273
My son got taken from me
by the County Welfare Board.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.108
Is there anything
I could do to help?

00:43.110 --> 00:45.310
Mary here is my secretary
and, I, uh...

00:45.312 --> 00:47.746
These are plane tickets
to Wisconsin

00:47.748 --> 00:50.716
where she and the boy
will be living
with his grandparents.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.785
You're addicted to
solving mysteries.

00:52.787 --> 00:56.488
When someone truly
and deeply loves you, Sam.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.890
<i> Why isn't that enough?</i>

00:57.892 --> 01:00.125
-Taking my 20.
-What are you doing?

01:00.127 --> 01:02.528
I'm done, Cut. I quit.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.430
You quit?

01:13.441 --> 01:15.474
(GRUNTING)

01:27.088 --> 01:28.320
(CLICKS)

01:28.389 --> 01:28.921
Why the beating?

01:28.923 --> 01:33.292
All the others you strangled
but you never touched
the face ever.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.394
Answer me.

01:36.697 --> 01:40.966
Sometimes I think
God is punishing me
with your stupidity.

01:40.968 --> 01:44.036
It's Sunday.
Most of the stores
are closed.

01:44.038 --> 01:46.004
-We'll go back...
-Time's up.

01:46.006 --> 01:46.472
War's starting.

01:46.474 --> 01:49.508
And we're stuck here
in the middle for
the coloreds to come at.

01:49.510 --> 01:53.512
We need to
get to the desert
for our children.

01:53.681 --> 01:56.014
We got others
to think of now.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.717
All right.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.919
Who do we know with money?

02:01.155 --> 02:03.655
Everyone's mad at us,
Charlie.

02:03.657 --> 02:04.523
Wilson and...

02:04.525 --> 02:05.357
Didn't one of
our little birds

02:05.359 --> 02:09.428
just get a ticket to fly away
to save her little chickadee?

02:09.430 --> 02:10.796
Right, Mary.

02:10.798 --> 02:11.864
But Mary's broke.

02:11.866 --> 02:15.767
Not her, dum-dum.
The guy who gave her
the money for the ticket.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.670
-SADIE: Gary.
-Gary.

02:20.741 --> 02:24.543
<i> He gave us some broke-down</i>
<i> Mescaline, right.</i>

02:24.545 --> 02:25.410
<i> So by my accounting...</i>

02:25.412 --> 02:26.778
SADIE: <i> We have it</i>
<i> handled, Charlie.</i>

02:26.780 --> 02:28.847
CHARLIE: <i> I know you do.</i>

02:29.150 --> 02:33.652
(CHUCKLES) Bet you're
gonna square up
that ledger too, huh?

02:34.488 --> 02:37.756
And get anything extra
the man might have.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.727
We need it all
for our pilgrimage.

02:44.965 --> 02:47.099
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

02:47.468 --> 02:49.501
Should've got milkshakes.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.436
We could go back.

02:51.438 --> 02:53.105
That would mean pants.

02:53.107 --> 02:54.673
You are such a square.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.708
What do you need
pants for?

02:58.212 --> 02:59.811
-Oh!
-Oh.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.713
Sorry, just...

03:02.183 --> 03:04.316
Forgot my biology book.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.418
-Is that my sweater,
Roberta?
-ROBERTA: Ha!

03:06.420 --> 03:09.421
Ask the girl stretching out
in my T-shirt, Wilhemina.

03:09.423 --> 03:12.624
I think we just scandalized
your poor sister.

03:13.127 --> 03:15.427
Bye. My eyeballs
are burning.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.129
-Bye.
-ROBERTA: Bye.

03:17.131 --> 03:18.530
(DOOR CLOSES)

03:18.732 --> 03:21.567
-I got an idea.
-Yes. Okay.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.735
That's stupid.
You haven't even
heard it yet.

03:23.737 --> 03:24.570
Stupid is my bag now.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.972
I'm an unemployed lug
eating fries on a rug

03:26.974 --> 03:28.974
-with some young blonde.
-(LAUGHS)

03:28.976 --> 03:29.408
Yeah, you are.

03:29.410 --> 03:32.911
But you look
more alive than
you did the day we met.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.847
Longer, baby.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.450
What's your idea?

03:38.452 --> 03:41.620
Well, there's this
beach in Malibu.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.823
It's perfect sand.
Nobody around for miles.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.858
Back when I was quitting
everything.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.293
You know, some days
would get really bad

03:48.295 --> 03:49.895
and I knew if I stayed
home all day long,

03:49.897 --> 03:53.332
I'd end up picking up
the phone and calling
my dealer.

03:53.334 --> 03:58.303
So, I'd hitch
a ride out there,
get myself stranded.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.707
I want to get stranded
there with you.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.178
-Quitter Beach, huh?
-Yeah.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.046
You earned a spot there.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.315
Well, I could use
a little color.

04:10.317 --> 04:10.882
(CHUCKLES)

04:10.884 --> 04:13.952
I've been thinking about
joining the Panthers.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.943
CUT: Hey, there you are.

04:37.945 --> 04:41.847
I got a homicide
with your name written
all over it. Hurry up.

04:44.418 --> 04:47.085
Hey, you really
gotta quit that crap.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.521
I know.
It'll kill me, right?

04:49.923 --> 04:51.790
Come on. Let's go.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.431
(DOOR SLIDES OPEN)

05:05.105 --> 05:06.838
You look thin.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.806
You eating?

05:07.808 --> 05:10.242
I haven't been
hungry lately.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.011
Been thinking
about Mom a lot.

05:13.013 --> 05:16.148
Yeah, I've been thinking
about her too.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.850
What is there
to say about it?

05:19.386 --> 05:21.653
Nothing. So let's not.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.754
All right, but...

05:22.756 --> 05:24.222
I, uh... (EXHALES)

05:24.224 --> 05:26.391
I've been thinking
a lot about what you said,

05:26.393 --> 05:28.627
about what you
asked me to do.

05:29.396 --> 05:30.696
And I'll be honest.
It made me angry.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.365
I know you're angry, Walt.
I'm just trying to help.

05:33.367 --> 05:34.933
I'll do it.

05:36.003 --> 05:36.968
You'll do what?

05:36.970 --> 05:38.770
I'll recant in writing.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.873
And then I'll just shut up
for the rest of my life.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.013
Are you sure?

05:48.015 --> 05:50.349
She didn't want
me to die in here.

05:50.351 --> 05:53.352
She was afraid that
I would die in here.

05:54.888 --> 05:55.420
Son...

05:55.422 --> 06:00.125
I have to tell them
where I'm going.
Can I stay with you?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.060
Yes.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.929
It's your home.

06:09.103 --> 06:11.203

down the street

06:36.497 --> 06:38.930

that we stop by.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.065
To thank you.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.400
-Can we come in?
-Sure.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.300
Do you guys want some tea?

06:42.302 --> 06:44.136
SADIE: Oh, sure,
that would be great.

06:44.138 --> 06:45.604
Thanks.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.641
Have a seat.

06:49.643 --> 06:50.542

07:11.331 --> 07:12.731
What do you think?

07:12.733 --> 07:15.967
-I gave you my entire stash.
-BOBBY: That was some stash.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.069
The mescaline might as well
have been bubble gum.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.806
I'm sorry.
I have a little grass.
Check under the sink.

of wine in the fridge.

GARY: I gave you what I had.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.284
I actually...
I borrowed some
of that money.

You better, Gary!

So are you hungry
or thirsty?

07:58.011 --> 07:58.910

Of course,
this is your home.

maybe we get, uh, dinner,

08:05.619 --> 08:08.453
maybe some Italian,
celebrate the end
of this...

<i> of a professor of economics.</i>

10:18.151 --> 10:19.951
It was them.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.660
It was them.
It was the SDS.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.295
This professor,
he co-authored a paper

10:30.297 --> 10:31.463
about a factory
production method

10:31.465 --> 10:33.798
that the military uses
to make weapons faster.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.266
They were talking about it
when I was there.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.035
They couldn't stop
talking about it.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.270

proof of this?

No.

10:46.713 --> 10:48.680
We heard you
the third time.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.582
And then we asked you
where to get it and how

10:50.584 --> 10:53.018
and you still
have no answer.

10:54.021 --> 10:57.822

Look at me!

11:09.036 --> 11:12.537
The end of the world.
It's coming.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.039
Charlie told us.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.041
And we need to act
as fast as we can

11:16.043 --> 11:19.310
to save the future
of our planet.

11:19.379 --> 11:23.481
Look, man, Charlie told us
to get the money from you.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.317
Wait, I have two cars.

It's banged up, but it runs.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.622
And I have a Fiat.

11:30.624 --> 11:31.756
That's something, right?

11:31.758 --> 11:34.592
I know where
we could take them,
get a few bucks for them.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.928
We need to ask Charlie first.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.331
All right,
I'll go call him.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.034
Probably won't
find who took it.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.136
No prints,
not a shoe scuff.

11:45.138 --> 11:48.406
-So clean I thought
my mom stole it.
-Huh!

11:48.408 --> 11:49.708
Yeah.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.876
One thing
to show you, Sam.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.646
Needs to be turned in
immediately, of course.

11:54.648 --> 11:57.782
I know you've stepped away
and everything, but...

11:57.784 --> 11:58.883
I just thought
you were the right man

11:58.885 --> 12:01.953

12:07.227 --> 12:09.961

-Any time.

-Take care of yourself.
-I will.

CHARLIE ON PHONE:

12:36.356 --> 12:38.656
Fiat might get us
a few hundred.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.392
Thing is, I think
Gary here is a dead end.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.194

12:45.599 --> 12:47.799

12:48.101 --> 12:49.968
You know why?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.836
We're the same.

12:51.838 --> 12:54.139

12:56.843 --> 13:00.311

Something like that, yeah.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.501

13:23.503 --> 13:25.637

you're the little one.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.078

<i> You're the boss now.</i>

13:45.592 --> 13:47.125
Okay.

13:47.894 --> 13:50.061
Now, Hinman's a teacher.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.830
He's from good stock.

13:51.832 --> 13:55.300
There's cash in that stone.
Squeeze it.

14:02.809 --> 14:05.109
It's the worst idea
you've ever had.

14:05.111 --> 14:06.144
You think so?

14:06.146 --> 14:07.946
I've been an attorney
a long time.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.247
As have I.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.882
Not a divorce lawyer.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.617
I know
how these things go.

below the belt...

14:14.821 --> 14:16.221
Choose to?

14:16.223 --> 14:17.689
Have to.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.958
Let me be blunt.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.093
You might
scare them, sure.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.161
Or make them angry.

14:23.163 --> 14:27.866
Grace's father
has all the power
and all the money in this.

14:28.134 --> 14:28.600

14:28.602 --> 14:32.170
there won't be a corner

You're blushing.

14:39.145 --> 14:42.247
Everyone will know
what I do with men.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.015
Is that what
you're trying to say?

14:44.017 --> 14:45.416
My advice...

14:45.418 --> 14:50.221
Do this quietly
and give your wife
what she wants.

14:52.092 --> 14:56.294
You're a good
lawyer, thinker.
You're strategic.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.195
That's not gonna work for me.

14:57.197 --> 15:02.467
I need a maniac who's
gonna burn the house down

-Don't do that.

It's insulting.

16:41.668 --> 16:46.104
Okay. Fine. You're right.
I'm a cop.

16:46.706 --> 16:47.872
Wow.

-No, help us.

to pull back,

24:25.665 --> 24:28.265
You're good.
Mary, please.

24:29.335 --> 24:30.801
I can't.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.270
Charlie.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.175
I don't want to die.

24:39.011 --> 24:42.012
Let's get you sewn up,
okay? And then...

24:42.014 --> 24:45.049
Then you'll remember
where the money is.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.418
And this will
all be over soon.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.689
Okay?

24:51.958 --> 24:53.691
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

24:55.394 --> 24:56.927
-Hey.
-Hi. I was in
the neighborhood.

24:56.929 --> 25:00.464
-This neighborhood?
-And I brought
you something.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.032
For our beach date.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.301
-Well, blue is my color.
-(CHUCKLES)

25:04.303 --> 25:07.972
-Can you stay?
-I got a client to
check on, but yep.

25:07.974 --> 25:12.076
Wouldn't mind having
a cigarette with the
handsomest nutcase I know.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.612
-You sweet talker.
-(CHUCKLES)

25:14.614 --> 25:16.480
So did you go
to work today?

25:16.482 --> 25:16.814

25:16.816 --> 25:21.352
Oh, nah.
I dropped an envelope off.
Yeah, but, no.

25:22.555 --> 25:23.721
How'd that go?

25:23.723 --> 25:25.789
I can imagine you'd want
to get it figured out.

25:25.791 --> 25:29.760
I want it to get figured out
by an officer of the law,

25:29.762 --> 25:32.897
of which I am not,
last I checked.

25:32.899 --> 25:36.634
I've got plenty to puzzle
out here in my own castle.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.305
How is Walt?

25:41.307 --> 25:42.773
Can you do me
a little favor

25:42.775 --> 25:45.376
and just tell me in that
sweet voice of yours

25:45.378 --> 25:46.644
that everything's
gonna be okay

25:46.646 --> 25:50.447
and he just needs time
to adjust, please.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.851
You know where
he just came from

25:53.853 --> 25:56.253
and what happened
to his mother.

25:56.756 --> 25:58.122
He shouldn't be better.

25:58.124 --> 26:01.392
Sam, there's no reason
why he would be, is there?

26:01.394 --> 26:02.560
Mmm-mmm.

26:02.562 --> 26:03.193
Nope.

26:03.195 --> 26:07.865
He makes excuses.
He doesn't want to
go outside, I think.

26:07.967 --> 26:08.732
Most of the guys
that I see

26:08.734 --> 26:11.302
deal with it
by shooting up
a world of heroin,

26:11.304 --> 26:13.737
but I wouldn't
recommend that.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.105

26:15.107 --> 26:20.511

reassuring voice
that I asked for.

recommendations?

26:23.182 --> 26:25.282

26:25.284 --> 26:30.020

for guilt and shame.

26:31.591 --> 26:34.925

then I would be
out of a job.

26:38.264 --> 26:44.868
Yeah, yeah, they're
military or anti-military.
I don't know anymore.

26:47.239 --> 26:49.106
Well, he's got one friend.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.575
Somebody who doesn't
think he's bad.

26:51.877 --> 26:53.644
His father.

26:55.681 --> 26:57.181
So what do I do?

26:57.183 --> 26:59.316
Show him that he's wrong.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.186
And if he isn't, well...

27:02.188 --> 27:05.823
The only way
you can know is
if you talk to his friends

27:05.825 --> 27:08.425
and find out
if they're still friends.

27:08.894 --> 27:10.260

You know why.

27:26.078 --> 27:29.947
Would you like
to state why
for the record?

me to tell the world
about the women.

28:06.352 --> 28:07.851

what you stole first.

You can start
recording this.

to answer that?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.266

who might have the cards.

I have, Hal?

28:32.111 --> 28:33.577

Okay, Ken. Let's just...

28:37.083 --> 28:38.849
Let's just?

28:41.053 --> 28:43.687
I ever tell you the time
I took three hits of acid

28:43.689 --> 28:46.457

the sun go down?

28:47.126 --> 28:48.559

destroying the world.

In fact,
I was convinced it was.

28:53.332 --> 28:57.935
And yet, the night came,
and then the morning,

28:58.337 --> 29:00.571
and I was still there.

29:00.806 --> 29:04.374
It was like God touched me
on the shoulder and said,

29:04.376 --> 29:08.779

so you can move on.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.115

36:56.281 --> 36:59.149
But it is vital
for the world.

37:00.686 --> 37:04.721
Helter Skelter is
rising right now.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.724
And you feel it
too, right?

37:08.760 --> 37:09.926
(INHALES DEEPLY)

37:09.928 --> 37:11.995
And me and you,

37:12.764 --> 37:14.731
sweet Mary.

37:15.167 --> 37:18.735
Me and you are
the king and queen to come.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.039
(SNIFFLES)

37:36.722 --> 37:38.255
(DOOR OPENS)

37:54.673 --> 37:56.673
(PHONE RINGING)

37:57.209 --> 37:58.241
Detective Shafe.

37:58.243 --> 37:59.809
SAM: <i> Hey, it's me. You busy?</i>

37:59.811 --> 38:02.946
Yes, and also,
I've never been
less busy in my life.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.348
I need you to check
fire department calls for me

38:05.350 --> 38:07.150
between 9:00 and 10:00
last night.

38:07.152 --> 38:08.618
Can you do that?

38:08.754 --> 38:10.654
Sure. Gladly.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.055
<i> Thank you.</i>

38:12.057 --> 38:14.124
Well done, Officer Tully.

38:14.126 --> 38:16.293
We arrested Leonard
this morning.

38:16.295 --> 38:20.230
Thanks to the evidence
provided by his girlfriend.

38:20.232 --> 38:21.531
Thanks to you.

38:21.533 --> 38:22.299
Good.

38:22.301 --> 38:24.868
His apartment was
brimming with dynamite.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.804
You should feel good
about this, Charmain.

38:27.873 --> 38:31.374
I'd like us to resume
working together.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.177
You want me back?

38:34.179 --> 38:36.146
You've proved
your worth.

38:36.148 --> 38:37.514
All I did was finish
what I was doing right

38:37.516 --> 38:40.450
around the time
you decided
I wasn't worth it.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.051
Sometimes these things...

38:41.053 --> 38:43.987
Save it for someone
who wants to work with you.

38:43.989 --> 38:44.688
I did what I wanted to.

38:44.690 --> 38:49.993
I finished what I started.
So thank you,
but I have other plans.

38:53.298 --> 38:55.398
(SEAGULLS CAWING)

39:10.882 --> 39:12.482
Sorry I'm late.

39:12.484 --> 39:14.918
Took a left
at Albuquerque.

39:15.654 --> 39:17.387
Where's the blue?

39:17.656 --> 39:19.322
I got a call.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.193
From a friend.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.795
Is it about those pictures?

39:28.266 --> 39:30.567
Did you even turn them in?

39:32.070 --> 39:34.137
You're right
about me, Billi.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.673
I am an addict.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.208
BILLI: I am an expert.

39:38.210 --> 39:42.011
At least the thing
you can't quit helps people.

39:42.447 --> 39:43.947
I thought you'd be mad.

39:43.949 --> 39:47.617
I'm pretty clear
on who the man is
I've been sleeping with.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.388
You're a mess.

39:52.124 --> 39:54.057
I like you anyway.

39:55.060 --> 39:55.992
(CHUCKLES)

39:55.994 --> 39:57.794
Why don't you
sit down a sec?

39:57.796 --> 39:59.696
Came all the way out here.

40:17.115 --> 40:20.250
SAM: I'm gonna get
some funky tan lines.

41:26.318 --> 41:30.119
Sorry, Officer,
I just pulled over
for a quick nap.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.554
What time is it?

41:31.556 --> 41:33.223
See some ID?

41:33.859 --> 41:35.758
Oh, sure. Sure.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.694
This your car?

41:37.996 --> 41:40.263
A friend loaned it to me.

41:40.398 --> 41:42.332
I'm just driving it home.

41:42.334 --> 41:45.168
Mind if I see
the registration?

41:46.071 --> 41:47.604
Sure.

41:51.176 --> 41:52.642
Hands up!

41:52.644 --> 41:57.247
Step out of the car!
Step out now!
Come on! Move it!

41:57.516 --> 41:58.615
Get out!

41:58.617 --> 42:01.451
Come on, right now! Get out!

42:01.453 --> 42:03.019
Keep your hands up.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.454
MAN: <i> Do it, Sam.</i>

42:05.290 --> 42:06.089
<i> Do it.</i>

42:06.091 --> 42:08.758
You're gonna hear
what the hammer claw
sounded like

42:08.760 --> 42:10.493
when you got it deep
in that pretty face of hers.

42:10.495 --> 42:13.763
-BRIAN: Sam, stop. Stop.
-Keep going. Keep going. Go!

42:13.765 --> 42:15.031
Shafe, get out of here.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.100
BRIAN: Put the gun down.
