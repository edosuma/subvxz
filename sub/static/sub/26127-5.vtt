00:43.794 --> 00:46.129
On my last day,
I'm thinking about starting a new life.

00:46.213 --> 00:49.091
Walking out them front doors.
It's an amazing feeling.

00:49.508 --> 00:52.469
- The best feeling in the world.
- You're just ready to touch the outside.

00:52.553 --> 00:57.558
The day I get out, I am probably
going to eat everything in sight.

01:03.981 --> 01:06.191
You walk out that front door
and you put it behind you.

01:06.692 --> 01:10.821
Ah... yes, man. I'm back on the street.
I can't believe this is really happening.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.740
Sun on my skin, let my hair out.
I gotta go.

01:14.116 --> 01:16.868
Walk out of those doors, it's gonna be
the best feeling in the world.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.996
- Best feeling in the world.
- Freedom.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.164
<i>I'm ready to go.</i>

01:21.915 --> 01:24.042
I'm ready to hit this motherfuckin' door.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.004
- I'mma hit that bitch running.
- Sure you ready?

01:27.087 --> 01:30.090
- Do you leave at, like, 11 or 12?
- Are you really ready?

01:30.173 --> 01:33.260
- I'm really ready, okay?
- I'm talking about up here.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.595
Oh, I'm ready.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.182
My name's Toyea Whittard,
I'm 23 years old.

01:39.266 --> 01:45.564
I'm here on VOP for reckless conduct,
disorderly, and trespassing.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.400
I've been here for 45 days.

01:50.861 --> 01:55.824
I caught all these charges 'cause
I fucked a bitch up 'cause of my kids.

01:57.034 --> 02:00.203
My aunt's friend came over
with her children.

02:00.287 --> 02:04.708
The little boy picked my daughter up, and
her head hit the bricks under the house.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.251
<i>I was at work.</i>

02:06.335 --> 02:09.003
<i>I got a phone call 'cause
my daughter had a concussion.</i>

02:09.588 --> 02:14.384
<i>Went home, and my aunt's friend
has this real loud ghetto mouth.</i>

02:14.468 --> 02:16.219
<i>And so when I said something
to her...</i>

02:16.637 --> 02:18.972
<i>she just really started,
you know firing...</i>

02:19.514 --> 02:21.558
and I blacked out and...

02:22.601 --> 02:24.811
ran up... and hit her in her face.

02:24.895 --> 02:25.729
Whoa!

02:26.313 --> 02:28.273
So, you know... I did that,

02:28.357 --> 02:31.610
the police came, I was still in the house,
'cause I knew I was going to jail.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.238
So I got anger problems, I had
anger problems since I was little.

02:36.114 --> 02:40.243
My mom said, from kindergarten,
I was pretty... rough.

02:41.203 --> 02:44.873
At school,
I didn't want to listen to authority.

02:45.374 --> 02:50.170
I wanted to do what I wanted to do...
raised all type of hell in school.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.548
Growing up, I was always
in so much trouble.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.802
I really don't know why I was so angry.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.387
And I still am angry.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.932
Nigga was posing and shit.
My mom was like, "This nigga..."

03:02.015 --> 03:04.476
When I'm angry... to that extent,

03:05.143 --> 03:06.311
nothing matters.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.480
And nothing can stop me from...

03:09.147 --> 03:11.983
doing what I wanna do.
It's an adrenaline rush.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.695
I don't know how to control my emotions.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.280
- It be hard...
- I just be seeing red, fuck that.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.658
- That's just what I'm saying.
- Yeah, red.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.829
I definitely can't do that no more.

03:23.912 --> 03:27.332
I don't like that my kids gotta be
with my mama or my boyfriend.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.418
I wanna be there
with my kids myself.

03:30.085 --> 03:34.256
It don't take control just on us...
It's on the kids too.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.758
- And you say you got how many?
- Four.

03:36.842 --> 03:41.513
Four kids, married...
separated, all type of shit.

03:41.596 --> 03:45.600
- Okay?
- A long story, long life for a young...

03:46.017 --> 03:49.271
For a young lady, you know,
I've been through it.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.123
What's your last name?

04:08.206 --> 04:09.791
- Rice.
- Who's got Rice's things?

04:09.875 --> 04:12.043
- You been here before?
- Once.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.128
One time?

04:16.505 --> 04:17.423
Here. Put it on.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.550
I can put it on?

04:19.843 --> 04:23.221
Once you put it on,
look into camera box number one for me.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.431
- Number one?
- Yes.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.267
You're good. Is today your birthday?

04:27.726 --> 04:29.186
Yeah, today my birthday...

04:29.811 --> 04:32.230
I made 21, finally, dog.

04:33.523 --> 04:37.527
You all, please don't have me like this
on my birthday, for real.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.196
For real.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.324
Walk through the metal detector.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.367
I crashed my girl's car, man.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.077
Bullshit.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.746
On my fucking birthday.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.082
- Get inside right here?
- Yep, in there. Yellow footprints.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.711
<i>I been to work, fucking from 8:00 to 1:30.</i>

04:55.128 --> 04:56.546
<i>Come out, went home,</i>

04:57.589 --> 04:59.925
drink a little bit,
went by my dad's house,

05:00.425 --> 05:03.595
drink a little bit, went by Walmart,
come back, hit the pole.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.055
Mm-hm.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.850
That's what happen when you
try to get lit on your birthday.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.148
Yeah.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.483
Shit got crazy.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.902
One minute
you're having fun, next minute...

05:19.528 --> 05:21.238
sitting in a cell.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.280
Dang.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.450
I told myself
I ain't never coming back to jail.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.494
Look what the fuck I did.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.163
I hit the goddamn pole, man.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.792
They is not going to let me out, bro.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.796
I'm finna sit in here and gonna rot.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.757
<i>They might not let me out...</i>

05:41.216 --> 05:43.301
<i>because I already on house arrest.</i>

05:44.177 --> 05:45.262
<i>The last time I been here...</i>

05:45.887 --> 05:49.391
they were trying to blame me for a
series of armed robberies and stuff,

05:49.474 --> 05:51.351
but... it wasn't me.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.438
I wonder if they gonna take
this shit off before I go upstairs.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.068
Everybody make sure
to tell you when you leave,

06:00.151 --> 06:02.153
they tell you, "Hey, don't come back."

06:03.738 --> 06:05.699
You gonna always find your way back.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.119
There ain't no place like home.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.373
Jail is home for a black man, man.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.292
Really.

06:20.005 --> 06:20.964
All right. Line up!

06:34.519 --> 06:35.353
Ham sandwich?

06:35.437 --> 06:36.771
I don't know what that is.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.481
Not happening.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.907
Shit has no juice.

06:46.990 --> 06:50.535
They treat us like shit in here, man.
Well, look at my juice.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.455
I'm just trying to get out of here.

06:53.538 --> 06:57.626
We all are. We all have children.
We all have families. We all have jobs.

06:57.709 --> 07:01.922
We all got grass to cut, you know?
None of us want to be in here for this.

07:04.049 --> 07:09.512
I got here Friday at around six o'clock.
But it feels like forever.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.600
For a silly reason, you know,
a silly mistake.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.813
I've been on probation
for possession of marijuana.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.650
I completed it, paid my fines.

07:22.108 --> 07:26.446
But, probation, that's something
you have to... stay on check.

07:28.740 --> 07:29.991
What you get arrested for?

07:30.116 --> 07:30.992
- Right now?
- Yeah.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.243
- Shoplifting.
- What?

07:32.327 --> 07:34.245
- Shoplifting.
- Oh, okay, okay, I got you.

07:37.332 --> 07:40.377
I was with some friends.
We went to Walmart.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.754
My friends, they were grabbing stuff.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.383
They got caught, but I was with them.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.637
When the police came,
the officer told me to turn around.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.473
And I'm just like,
"What? What's going on?"

07:53.556 --> 07:57.352
And he just said, "Yeah,
you have a warrant for your arrest."

07:58.436 --> 08:00.271
He said, "Violation of probation."

08:06.111 --> 08:10.490
I had a bond for the shoplifting charges,
but they told me I couldn't bond out.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.245
I just don't know
what's going to happen with me.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.288
If I'mma stay locked up
or get out of here.

08:18.081 --> 08:18.957
It sucks.

08:20.750 --> 08:25.213
- I miss my girl, man. I miss my old lady.
- Me too, man.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.675
I'm telling you, I was supposed
to get married tomorrow, man.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.593
God damn!

08:31.219 --> 08:32.721
- Come on, dude.
- It's bullshit.

08:33.304 --> 08:37.808
I already had it all planned out.
I already have the rings waiting at home.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.645
My fiancée, she's had her dress all ready.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.691
I'm just really hoping I get outta here...
Hmm...

08:46.067 --> 08:46.901
Hello?

08:46.985 --> 08:48.069
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

08:48.194 --> 08:49.112
Hey, babe.

08:49.571 --> 08:50.613
<i>What's up?</i>

08:51.072 --> 08:52.407
I'm stressed out.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.994
Hopefully I'll be able to get outta here.

08:56.995 --> 08:57.996
<i>That's what I want.</i>

08:58.079 --> 09:01.082
Just, I really need
to get that warrant cleared.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.462
I just wanna know what's gonna happen.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.467
<i>Remember, no matter what happens,
just know I'm always gonna be here.</i>

09:20.477 --> 09:21.811
Today's my birthday.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.855
Mm-hm.

09:25.148 --> 09:29.527
I make <i>veintiuno.</i>
Me, I make <i>veintiuno</i> today.

09:29.611 --> 09:30.695
Yeah, man.

09:31.613 --> 09:33.782
I've been waiting for this day
for a minute, bro.

09:33.865 --> 09:36.076
But I'm still kind of drunk
right now, too.

09:37.911 --> 09:38.745
Rice?

09:38.828 --> 09:39.662
Bring my stuff?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.039
Yep, grab your paperwork.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.542
I'm vexed, dog. Upset, dog.

09:44.626 --> 09:47.879
Stand right here in this yellow square
for me. Hands down by your side.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.548
<i>The only times I got locked up
been up here in Atlanta.</i>

09:50.632 --> 09:52.092
<i>I never been arrested at home.</i>

09:52.175 --> 09:53.259
Where were you born?

09:53.343 --> 09:54.594
Atlanta, Georgia.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.973
I was born up here, but I was raised
down in the Virgin Islands.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.185
<i>Came up here when I was 19,
ain't had no record.</i>

10:03.019 --> 10:04.687
No, nothing. Came up here.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.816
Your height and weight?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.984
I probably like 5' 11".

10:10.610 --> 10:11.653
My weight is like...

10:12.320 --> 10:13.530
you know, skinny.

10:14.072 --> 10:17.242
Okay, I don't have skinny.
How about 140, is that roughly right?

10:17.325 --> 10:18.743
- Yeah.
- How many tattoos?

10:18.827 --> 10:20.829
I look skinny, right?
I only got two tattoos.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.333
All right, sir. You have three citations.

10:30.547 --> 10:34.425
Unsafe lane change, no driver's license
and driving too fast for conditions.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.679
$953 is your total bond.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.101
In order to post bond, you can pay cash.
That would be the entire amount.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.561
So I can go, for real?

10:44.644 --> 10:45.562
Are you listening to me?

10:45.645 --> 10:48.106
Yeah, I listening.
That's all I hear, I could get out.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.023
You can get out.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.860
If you can't bond out, you'll go to court
Monday morning at eight.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.821
Today is Saturday, oh God!

10:54.904 --> 10:56.364
<i>I just wanna go to sleep.</i>

10:57.198 --> 11:00.034
<i>Hopefully I get out in a few hours,
you know?</i>

11:00.160 --> 11:02.078
<i>I wait for this day so long, you know?</i>

11:02.662 --> 11:04.330
<i>I'm blessed to see 21.</i>

11:04.414 --> 11:05.623
Set your paperwork right here.

11:06.124 --> 11:09.460
My brother got killed when he was
19 years old, my older brother.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.963
I was 15. My brother was 19.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.799
That's why I got the tattoo.

11:14.883 --> 11:15.717
You know what I'm saying.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.637
It's my brother that got killed, that's
why I have the RIP over this one.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.850
So even if I'm in prison, in jail...

11:24.309 --> 11:26.561
I'm still blessed,
I don't even care right now.

11:27.770 --> 11:28.646
Hey!

11:29.772 --> 11:31.232
All wake up, brother.

11:32.025 --> 11:32.859
Wake up!

11:34.444 --> 11:35.278
Y'all stink.

11:35.862 --> 11:36.779
Home, sweet home.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.949
Home, sweet home, shit!
I don't live with no niggas, dog.

11:40.033 --> 11:44.078
Man, I can't even get a little seat here.
It's fucking crowded, dog.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.665
I don't even wanna sleep,
no nothing right now with the goddamn...

11:48.124 --> 11:50.793
I'm just waiting
to get the fuck out of here.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.639
What you going to do
when you get out there?

12:02.722 --> 12:05.934
Uh, I don't know,
probably hit up my girlfriend.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.853
- You know what I'm saying? What she on.
- Well, yeah. First, first.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.608
I'm talking about getting out,
about to eat some real food.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.652
Sit with your family,
you know what I mean?

12:17.320 --> 12:21.115
The first week here
felt like... just regular jail,

12:21.199 --> 12:23.326
then the second week felt like prison.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.119
It's hard. It's very, very hard.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.539
I'm just happy it's over, almost.

12:28.623 --> 12:29.958
Tell him the story.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.001
- Of what?
- About the beer.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.296
I get two, you know what I'm saying,
Budweisers... Appreciate it.

12:36.047 --> 12:40.134
I just got two, you know, cases of
Budweiser, put it in a cart, in a buggy.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.387
I go straight to the register.

12:42.512 --> 12:46.432
Me and the lady catch eye contact
like in the nastiest way.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.685
She got like scared, like tempted.

12:48.768 --> 12:53.273
And so she get on the little radio, blah
blah... I'm like, "Man, F this cart..."

12:53.356 --> 12:57.360
So I just went straight out, you know,
straight out to the parking lot.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.697
So you was outside
but the beer was inside?

13:00.780 --> 13:03.574
Yeah, I ain't taken nothing
out of the store, bro.

13:04.158 --> 13:07.412
I see the cop pulling in,
do a swing, you know.

13:07.495 --> 13:11.624
Turn around,
"Hey you, stop!" So, I'm like, "Man..."

13:11.708 --> 13:13.918
Before the beer incident,
you was already on probation.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.379
But the probation officer's
basically been saying,

13:16.462 --> 13:19.007
"Look, you violated by having
a run-in with the police.

13:19.090 --> 13:22.593
We gonna set your black ass in here
and you gonna do your time that way."

13:25.722 --> 13:29.684
I'm 26. I'm charged with...
theft by shoplifting.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.397
And that was good because...
You know what I'm saying?

13:34.480 --> 13:37.108
My PO, she was telling the judge,
you know what I'm saying,

13:37.191 --> 13:38.943
"He gotta look after his grandma,"
you know,

13:39.027 --> 13:40.236
- which is true.
- Right, right.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.739
He gotta take pills for bipolar,
which is true.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.325
I have bipolar...

13:45.408 --> 13:48.995
uh, depression, and, uh,
bipolar schizophrenia.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.791
Even at five years old, I knew something
was different but I didn't really know...

13:53.916 --> 13:56.669
you know what I'm saying,
what it was.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.630
The first time he came, he was asleep,
and all we hear was...

14:01.007 --> 14:02.342
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you!

14:02.717 --> 14:05.636
The first night was,
"Oh, okay, maybe he just in here,

14:05.720 --> 14:08.681
you know, having a dream." Then
the next night he did that shit again.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.851
Going to sleep at night,
sometimes I hear voices.

14:11.934 --> 14:15.104
Sometimes they're like
very, very strong.

14:15.688 --> 14:19.525
And they're really vulgar
and they say inappropriate things.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.446
He said he had a condition. I said, "Why
don't you try to go get some medicine?"

14:23.529 --> 14:26.157
- You know, pill call?
- I actually told the nurse downstairs

14:26.240 --> 14:28.201
what pills I needed,
you know what I'm saying?

14:28.284 --> 14:30.536
She said, "Yeah, we gonna
give you some pills, whatever."

14:30.620 --> 14:33.122
I been here 20 days,
ain't took no pills.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.749
Didn't take nothing.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.335
I told him, "When you get out,
you gotta take that medicine."

14:37.418 --> 14:38.461
- Yeah.
- Know what I mean?

14:38.544 --> 14:39.837
Yeah. Mm-hm.

14:41.506 --> 14:44.300
You step over here.
You get your pill.

14:45.676 --> 14:48.638
<i>Some individuals come in with
their own mental health medications.</i>

14:48.721 --> 14:51.557
Then you have those on medication
that's been prescribed here,

14:51.641 --> 14:53.267
through the medical department.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.063
Our goal here is to make sure
that everybody is taken care of.

14:57.480 --> 15:01.109
But there are those individuals that...
we find that...

15:01.901 --> 15:06.697
slip through the cracks, and we go back
and try to get those issues resolved.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.617
You said your brother would come get you?

15:09.700 --> 15:12.036
Yeah, my brother's gonna come get me,
my oldest brother.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.163
- Gonna do it up.
- That's cool, yeah.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.249
- Yeah
- And you gotta have that plan...

15:16.374 --> 15:17.542
and you got to execute.

15:17.667 --> 15:21.295
Make sure you get your medicine and
stay focused, you know what I mean?

15:28.678 --> 15:32.181
- Don't get me goddamn started.
- I got no time for that.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.225
Ooh... Ching!

15:34.308 --> 15:37.186
That jack just walked
like a motherfucker, hold up!

15:37.270 --> 15:39.939
- Oh, no she didn't.
- I'll take our kings.

15:41.065 --> 15:44.026
<i>I met some great women in here, but...</i>

15:44.110 --> 15:47.613
<i>it's a lot of females
and different attitudes, so...</i>

15:47.697 --> 15:50.616
my 45 days have been
hell on wheels, um...

15:50.700 --> 15:52.493
You know, I went through
my ups and downs.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.203
I've got into a fight
since I've been here.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.998
I've been to the hole they call IMAX..

15:58.124 --> 15:59.625
<i>I went up there for six days.</i>

16:03.713 --> 16:06.215
There's like a handful
of motherfuckers in here...

16:06.716 --> 16:09.093
and it's loud as hell.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.137
Ssshhhh!

16:11.220 --> 16:12.180
Don't turn up.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.598
- Relax...
- Just relax, okay?

16:15.016 --> 16:17.268
Don't do it, I don't want you
going to IMAX.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.395
I do have anger issues.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.856
Since I was 20, I've been on probation.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.233
I still have three and a half more years
to go.

16:24.317 --> 16:29.238
And so the judge reprimanded me
to go do anger management classes.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.950
I'm going to try to take these classes,
because if I don't...

16:33.034 --> 16:35.453
get it under control,
I'll be right back here.

16:35.870 --> 16:39.207
We been getting some dirty looks,
but I ain't gonna say nothing though.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.876
I know I been gettin' dirty looks,
but guess what?

16:41.959 --> 16:44.295
These ho's hating 'cause I'm going home.

16:44.921 --> 16:48.174
I'm so ready. My mama gonna
take me to Waffle House when I get out.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.967
I'mma go get me a, um...

16:50.051 --> 16:52.428
a double hash brown with everything in it.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.556
I need some coffee.
'Cause I don't plan on sleeping tonight.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.269
- Coffee?
- You got coffee?

17:01.229 --> 17:02.271
Bye!

17:03.481 --> 17:04.815
Don't come back.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.108
Good luck, honey.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.151
Bye, honey.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.237
She's leaving tonight.

17:09.737 --> 17:10.613
I am.

17:10.695 --> 17:11.948
- Okay, be good.
- Be good.

17:12.573 --> 17:13.406
Bye.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.617
- Bye, honey.
- Bye, honey.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.460
Being here and away from my children,

17:24.544 --> 17:29.257
I realized I need to, you know,
wise up and be a woman

17:29.340 --> 17:31.425
that has four children and...

17:31.926 --> 17:33.177
stop acting on impulse.

17:33.678 --> 17:39.058
Try to channel my bad experiences
as a lesson for my kids

17:39.141 --> 17:41.894
so they won't follow through
with the same mistakes that I made.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.865
<i>Hey baby. What's up?</i>

17:55.491 --> 17:59.161
They're about to send me upstairs.
I just wanted to let you know.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.083
We normally keep them down there
for 48 hours.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.253
Just to give them the opportunity
if they're gonna make bond or not.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.507
At that point, if they're not bonded,
they're then showered,

18:11.591 --> 18:13.843
and their personal property's inventoried,

18:13.926 --> 18:16.887
and then they're headed upstairs
to the classification unit.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.724
I just wanna make you my wife.

18:21.851 --> 18:25.771
I was supposed to get married tomorrow.
I guess that's getting canceled.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.191
I wish...

18:29.859 --> 18:31.861
I could go back in time
and change everything.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.739
I wouldn't be in this mess.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.282
<i>Stop thinking about it.</i>

18:36.365 --> 18:37.992
<i>You're gonna beat yourself up.</i>

18:40.828 --> 18:45.166
Sometimes, I guess, we have to
go through stuff to learn... what...

18:46.375 --> 18:47.585
life's really about.

18:48.169 --> 18:52.381
I'll call your name, start lining up.
Ortega. Sagrero.

18:55.843 --> 18:58.220
I was actually going on
a good path in life.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.391
Went to school. Had a job.
Had my own car.

19:03.517 --> 19:04.477
The American dream.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.441
My mom, that's why she brought me here
to the US.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.777
To get me and my brother a better life.

19:13.778 --> 19:15.363
I wasn't born here, you know?

19:15.905 --> 19:19.283
I came here when I was very young...
illegally.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.286
All right, so you're about to watch
a couple videos.

19:22.370 --> 19:25.414
They're both really important.
No talking, got it?

19:28.751 --> 19:31.587
I arrived here back in 2003.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.131
I was four years old.

19:35.216 --> 19:39.512
Yeah, we crossed...
over here through Arizona.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.979
I just remember a lot of walking.

19:50.648 --> 19:53.818
A lot of having to hide, actually,
from immigration.

19:56.654 --> 20:01.075
Having to stay... low-key
and not get caught.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.453
My mom having to carry me a lot.

20:05.329 --> 20:08.666
She said she carried me most of the way

20:17.633 --> 20:20.970
It's harder to live life here
not being a citizen.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.766
At any point,
immigration can go to your house

20:25.850 --> 20:27.852
and just for no reason, you know...

20:28.436 --> 20:32.440
they can have your whole family
back... sent to Mexico.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.695
It happened to my step-dad.
He got in a car accident.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.990
And because he... didn't have a license...

20:42.032 --> 20:43.909
he... They deported him.

20:45.494 --> 20:49.498
I'm just like, "Wow, really?"
Just for not having a license?

20:50.416 --> 20:52.293
It just really sucks.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.754
I'm really tired, to be honest.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.672
Haven't been sleeping.

20:58.841 --> 20:59.759
Can't get no sleep.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.595
Hopefully immigration doesn't show up.

21:02.678 --> 21:06.140
You ain't going nowhere. you've been
here all your life, you're going nowhere.

21:07.308 --> 21:11.937
Hopefully, man. I just really want to
leave and get outta here already,

21:12.021 --> 21:14.440
I mean, before immigration comes.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.867
I wrecked my girl's car, bruh.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.577
I told her I got in an accident,

21:26.660 --> 21:28.704
but I ain't told her
I totaled her shit though.

21:28.788 --> 21:29.789
You totaled it?

21:29.872 --> 21:31.165
Bruh, she gonna kill me!

21:32.625 --> 21:34.251
She gonna kill me, bruh.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.129
I really come up here
to finish school, but...

21:37.213 --> 21:39.799
I had to do work 'cause I got two kids.

21:39.882 --> 21:40.841
Three.

21:41.342 --> 21:44.470
Almost three, 'cause my girl, Von,
pregnant right now.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.764
<i>You may start
the conversation now.</i>

21:47.264 --> 21:48.307
Baby.

21:48.390 --> 21:49.225
<i>What?</i>

21:49.308 --> 21:51.060
I'm in fucking jail, man.

21:51.602 --> 21:52.603
<i>I know where you at.</i>

21:53.562 --> 21:55.481
I got bail, you know?
I got bond, you know?

21:55.689 --> 21:57.733
I know how much your bond is already.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.193
Well, you gonna pay it?

21:59.276 --> 22:01.111
<i>I'm not finna coddle your ass.</i>

22:01.195 --> 22:03.364
<i>You think I got extra money
to be throwing out in the trash?</i>

22:03.948 --> 22:04.782
I know, baby.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.992
<i>Your daddy is trying to figure a way
to get you out tonight.</i>

22:07.076 --> 22:07.993
Big thanks.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.995
<i>How am I gonna get back and forth
to fucking work?</i>

22:10.663 --> 22:13.499
<i>I specifically asked you not to drive
my car like that, right?</i>

22:13.582 --> 22:15.167
I'm so sorry, mama.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.752
<i>You think sorry gonna change anything?</i>

22:16.836 --> 22:19.797
<i>You think sorry gonna make anything
different, make anything better?</i>

22:19.880 --> 22:22.174
<i>You hit a fucking non-moving object.</i>

22:22.842 --> 22:24.844
You're right. Don't stress, okay?

22:24.927 --> 22:26.804
<i>That's easy for you to fucking say.</i>

22:26.887 --> 22:28.556
It's not easy, I just trying to keep
you on the positive side.

22:28.639 --> 22:30.182
<i>It's easy for you to fucking say!</i>

22:30.266 --> 22:33.060
<i>Man, you ain't gonna keep me
on no positive side,</i>

22:33.227 --> 22:34.937
<i>'cause ain't nothing fucking positive.</i>

22:35.354 --> 22:37.022
<i>I'm pissed the fuck off.</i>

22:37.815 --> 22:40.109
I don't like a woman that'll trip, but...

22:40.192 --> 22:41.402
she do a lot for me.

22:41.485 --> 22:43.821
More than any girl ever do for me.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.824
That's a girl
that I will always love, dog.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.326
I love you.

22:50.619 --> 22:51.871
<i>What's love got to do with it?</i>

22:52.329 --> 22:54.665
What, not even "I love you" back?

22:55.207 --> 22:58.586
<i>Love ain't gonna do shit for me.
Fuck me over, that's what love do.</i>

22:59.086 --> 22:59.962
<i>Fuck me over.</i>

23:01.130 --> 23:01.964
Ain't gonna lie.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.466
I been fucking up. Like, I been slipping.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.178
I really just been
taking chances today, man.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.349
This is a fucking hell right now.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.872
The first week here,
it was kind of like, you know...

23:35.497 --> 23:37.374
somebody had my mind, like, at a grip.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.086
Not taking my medication,

23:41.170 --> 23:43.088
it was really like hell, almost.

23:43.172 --> 23:47.259
Really like being in... a cage, almost.

23:48.469 --> 23:51.972
When you feel that way, you push yourself
away from conversation.

23:57.061 --> 24:00.397
It's dangerous almost for someone
with mental issues.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.650
Because they don't know where they're at.

24:06.737 --> 24:09.239
It feels like other people around you
are watching something

24:09.323 --> 24:10.991
totally different than
what you're watching.

24:14.620 --> 24:18.749
I'm dealing with the world while I'm
dealing with a whole different world.

24:20.542 --> 24:23.170
It's energy draining,
trying to listen to people

24:23.253 --> 24:26.340
and listen to what's going on
in your head.

24:26.423 --> 24:27.841
- That way.
- That way.

24:39.937 --> 24:42.481
When I'm angry, lonely...

24:42.564 --> 24:45.234
basketball gives me reason in life.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.826
You know, walk on to the court
and it wakes me up.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.661
Y'all ready for this? Okay.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.748
Makes me smile.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.250
It's on right now.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.877
It makes me feel sane. Almost.

25:03.961 --> 25:04.795
Let's go!

25:11.885 --> 25:13.929
Ooohhh!

25:16.390 --> 25:18.225
<i>Break time is ending
at this time.</i>

25:18.308 --> 25:19.935
<i>I need everybody to pick it up.</i>

25:21.812 --> 25:25.858
I would kill for a cigarette,
dude. Not literally.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.943
That was figuratively.

25:28.944 --> 25:33.574
It's just I haven't had one in five days,
and I would love to have a cigarette.

25:33.657 --> 25:34.616
Yeah.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.500
<i>This is
a prepaid collect call from...</i>

25:45.002 --> 25:46.962
<i>Bueno. What's up?</i>

25:47.921 --> 25:48.797
Hey.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.800
Can you check what's my status?

25:53.927 --> 25:55.054
<i>It says "Hold...</i>

25:56.055 --> 25:56.972
<i>for immigration."</i>

25:59.224 --> 26:01.226
This is bullshit.

26:01.852 --> 26:05.481
Got a hold for immigration.
Can't be bonded out from that.

26:05.981 --> 26:09.193
<i>Scary situation, not knowing
what's going to happen next.</i>

26:10.027 --> 26:13.238
They're really trying to send me back
to a place I've never been...

26:13.655 --> 26:14.573
for shoplifting.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.700
<i>You only have Trump to thank.</i>

26:17.659 --> 26:18.994
I feel so bad

26:19.078 --> 26:21.246
my mom's going through this again.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.707
<i>We need to get married ASAP.</i>

26:24.625 --> 26:25.751
Stay calm, okay?

26:25.834 --> 26:27.086
So I could be calm.

26:28.879 --> 26:30.089
I love you, baby.

26:30.756 --> 26:31.715
<i>I love you, too.</i>

26:42.684 --> 26:44.978
803B, Eichelberger. You're going out sir.

26:51.527 --> 26:55.531
The biggest challenge when
being released from Gwinnett County is

26:55.614 --> 26:59.827
not having the people in place
or the support in place to assist them

26:59.910 --> 27:03.580
with staying on track,
meaning making sure they have shelter,

27:03.705 --> 27:05.415
and just providing for them.

27:10.129 --> 27:13.882
They say you come to Gwinnett, uh,
on vacation, you leave on probation.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.804
Gonna hit this door, see my babies.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.561
Right side of the hallway.

27:26.145 --> 27:30.858
<i>When I walk outside, it's a big world
and I guess, being a grown man now...</i>

27:31.441 --> 27:34.361
<i>I accept the fact
that I can't handle it by myself.</i>

27:35.988 --> 27:36.822
<i>I do need help.</i>

27:36.905 --> 27:41.910
<i>So I think, taking my medication... and
I'll start feeling like my normal self.</i>

27:42.536 --> 27:44.580
<i>I haven't been myself for a long time.</i>

27:46.039 --> 27:48.167
<i>What'll definitely stay on my mind</i>

27:48.292 --> 27:50.711
<i>is trying to stay outta trouble
with my children.</i>

27:53.046 --> 27:56.383
<i>You know, I've missed so much,
so it definitely hurts.</i>

27:58.343 --> 28:00.762
<i>I just have to let them know
I won't leave no more.</i>

28:01.555 --> 28:02.848
Proceed on your left.

28:05.809 --> 28:08.645
Get dressed in the stall and I'll give you
the rest of your property then.

28:09.980 --> 28:12.024
<i>Goodbye, Gwinnett County Jail.</i>

28:12.733 --> 28:13.650
Bye, take care.

28:14.026 --> 28:14.902
You, too.

28:14.985 --> 28:16.236
Oh, you'll never see me again.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.154
I hope not.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.491
Shower shoes go in the trash.
Or you wanna keep 'em?

28:21.950 --> 28:23.202
- Nah.
- You sure?

28:23.285 --> 28:25.078
- Yeah, I'm good.
- All right.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.999
- I'm ready. I'm ready to see trees!
- To see trees!

28:31.043 --> 28:32.669
We're going under trees!

28:32.753 --> 28:34.463
Like, I wanna see real cement.

28:43.931 --> 28:44.932
I'm free!

28:46.016 --> 28:47.100
Feels good, doesn't it?

28:47.184 --> 28:48.185
It does feel good.

28:50.562 --> 28:54.024
Having bipolar, everything
is like a puzzle sometimes.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.280
I have a lot to conquer.

29:01.114 --> 29:02.991
The human mind, body, and soul.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.162
I feel like I can.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.256
What's up with you?

29:18.423 --> 29:19.800
Good, good, good.

29:40.153 --> 29:40.988
Yoshua!

29:42.948 --> 29:48.370
<i>Um, not too long ago, an immigration
officer came and... he talked to me.</i>

29:49.746 --> 29:50.789
<i>He just said...</i>

29:51.456 --> 29:54.918
"You're actually being held
for immigration...

29:55.919 --> 29:57.754
because you're here illegally."

29:58.380 --> 30:00.674
Based on immigration laws,

30:00.757 --> 30:07.139
we place holds on subjects who are
foreign-born and have committed a crime.

30:08.140 --> 30:11.852
It's the initial phase of getting them
before an immigration judge...

30:11.977 --> 30:16.815
the determining factor on whether that
particular individual will be deported.

30:18.442 --> 30:21.486
There's no bond for that,
after 30 days, you know.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.156
Immigration is going to
go and pick you up.

30:25.282 --> 30:27.826
And send you back to Mexico.

30:28.368 --> 30:33.623
Our local agencies have gotten together
to assist ICE... with, uh...

30:34.249 --> 30:41.006
detaining and helping with removing people
here that are illegal that violate laws.

30:42.632 --> 30:47.095
I mean, I really didn't...
expect for this to happen to me.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.768
I don't consider myself
an American citizen,

30:52.851 --> 30:54.269
but this is where I belong.

30:54.644 --> 30:57.397
You know, here with my family,
people I know.

31:05.113 --> 31:08.033
They're trying to send me to a place
I've never been.

31:15.415 --> 31:19.461
I wish I could go back in time
and make things different, but...

31:20.212 --> 31:24.174
but what happened happened,
and I can't change it. So...

31:25.342 --> 31:28.011
I guess sometimes you have to
deal with the consequences.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.394
I'm ready to go home, man.

31:36.353 --> 31:37.687
I wanna go home.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.817
Dog, if I could've bailed myself out,
I'd bail myself out right now.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.777
My wallet, everything,
they got all of that.

31:44.361 --> 31:46.571
Let me call my father
and see what's taking him

31:46.655 --> 31:48.365
so fucking long to get to me.

31:49.449 --> 31:50.617
<i>They getting you ready?</i>

31:50.951 --> 31:51.993
They getting me ready?

31:52.619 --> 31:55.914
<i>I thought you were... Yeah,
I'm sitting outside right now, you know?</i>

31:56.039 --> 31:57.916
Oh yeah?
You done pay my bond already?

31:57.999 --> 31:58.875
<i>Yeah!</i>

32:00.669 --> 32:01.920
Yeah, me so...

32:02.003 --> 32:02.963
Hey... glad to hear...

32:03.046 --> 32:04.881
Hey... glad to hear.

32:05.006 --> 32:06.299
Because I got to take a shit.

32:08.093 --> 32:08.927
For real?

32:09.010 --> 32:10.429
<i>We sitting outside. We be outside.</i>

32:10.512 --> 32:12.764
- Okay, all right.
<i>- All right.</i>

32:12.848 --> 32:14.808
Yes, sir. Yeah.

32:17.018 --> 32:18.812
Dog... God is so good!

32:19.813 --> 32:20.814
He just know.

32:20.897 --> 32:21.815
See?

32:21.898 --> 32:24.151
There's the woman with my paperwork
right there.

32:24.234 --> 32:25.277
Come on with it.

32:37.330 --> 32:38.874
First and last time

32:39.291 --> 32:41.751
in Gwinnett County Hotel.

32:52.512 --> 32:55.098
Oh... Oh... Bitch!

32:55.932 --> 32:57.893
- I'm free!
- 'Bout damn time.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.561
Fuck you mean, bitch?

33:01.062 --> 33:02.564
Please, faster.

33:02.647 --> 33:05.775
<i>I'm very excited
to see my mom and my kids.</i>

33:06.651 --> 33:08.361
I love my babies to death.

33:10.864 --> 33:14.326
Uh, we're looking for you guys.
Where are you located in the parking lot?

33:15.202 --> 33:19.039
What...? Oh, I see Daddy with his orange
on. We can't miss him. He orange.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.791
- Oh, I see him.
- Is that my son running by him?

33:29.049 --> 33:30.091
Hey, Mommy!

33:32.344 --> 33:33.887
<i>I've been through a lot in my life.</i>

33:35.430 --> 33:37.849
<i>I learned that everything
happens for a reason.</i>

33:39.434 --> 33:40.769
You're so pretty!

33:40.852 --> 33:43.897
<i>I need to stop
and think about my actions.</i>

33:44.814 --> 33:46.608
I lost weight, look at my pants.

33:48.485 --> 33:50.362
Hey, Jayden. Ooh...

33:51.071 --> 33:53.740
<i>I don't know what my life would be like
if I didn't have my kids.</i>

33:53.823 --> 33:55.867
- Mommy loves you.
- I love you, too.

33:55.951 --> 33:59.204
I missed you. Did you miss Mommy?
Gimme sugar.

33:59.287 --> 34:03.124
To see them, it reminded me of what
I can lose if I come back to jail.

34:03.708 --> 34:04.709
Did you miss Mommy?

34:05.252 --> 34:07.087
- Mommy misses you.
- Girl...

34:08.338 --> 34:10.340
I love you, too. Hey, Daddy!

34:11.632 --> 34:14.803
I've gotten appointments for my
anger management classes already.

34:14.886 --> 34:18.098
And so, I'm moving in the right direction.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.183
So I'm very excited about that.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.185
It's nothing that's impossible.

34:23.812 --> 34:26.856
I'm free at last. Is that a pork chop?

34:26.940 --> 34:27.857
Yes.

34:27.940 --> 34:31.610
Oh, Jesus Christ...
Nobody's getting none of this.

34:51.715 --> 34:53.300
Jail ain't a place for me, man.

34:53.717 --> 34:56.177
I became too spoiled, dog.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.097
Feels good.

34:59.180 --> 35:02.559
Freaking... going home, take a shit...

35:03.226 --> 35:05.478
drink some water, go to work.

35:05.979 --> 35:07.689
I ain't even taking a shower!,,,,

35:29.753 --> 35:31.755
Damn. Beautiful day.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.801
Back at home. I just got to be careful,
you know what I'm saying?

35:38.011 --> 35:40.764
But, uh, it's going to be what it is.

35:41.931 --> 35:45.060
It's either we get out, you know
what I'm saying, and get healthy,

35:45.143 --> 35:49.397
or we keep backing off,
backing off into, like, a hole, almost.

35:50.565 --> 35:51.691
Come on, Ced!

35:53.026 --> 35:54.319
Gimme straight points!

36:12.337 --> 36:15.256
I'm going to sign my voluntary departure.

36:16.716 --> 36:21.638
Because if they deport you, that's ten
years that I can't come back to the US.

36:22.138 --> 36:25.016
And if I sign voluntarily,
it'll just be three years.

36:26.351 --> 36:30.271
I'm just now waiting for immigration
to take me on that plane and...

36:31.439 --> 36:33.650
ready to go to Mexico, I guess!

36:35.360 --> 36:36.277
Yeah.

37:15.066 --> 37:18.778
<i>Real gangsters, man,
they got some real shit to talk about.</i>

37:20.655 --> 37:22.615
- What happened to your arm?
- Got shot.

37:23.533 --> 37:26.995
Bullet went in my arm right here, and
the bullet's still in the back of my arm.

37:27.370 --> 37:31.082
<i>This shit come back and hurt you.
I turned evil, man.</i>

37:32.250 --> 37:36.337
At the age of 13, I had me kill somebody.
I killed my first person.

37:37.130 --> 37:38.256
And it felt good.
