00:01.269 --> 00:04.305
Previously on Blue Bloods...
Jacob Krystal.

00:04.338 --> 00:06.307
Erin Reagan.
Hi.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.643
Nicky.
Nice to
meet you both.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.552
ERIN:
Maybe you could explain to me

00:18.586 --> 00:20.088
why you were following me
this morning.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.223
Detective Deleon.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.525
And you're not the
one I was watching.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.695
Jacob?
I'm in charge of
investigating art thefts

00:27.728 --> 00:29.463
from galleries, museums--

00:29.497 --> 00:31.465
we believe that Mr. Krystal

00:31.499 --> 00:33.767
is responsible for a
number of major hauls,

00:33.801 --> 00:35.203
both here and abroad.

00:35.236 --> 00:38.239
Suppose somebody
stole this locket,

00:38.272 --> 00:40.308
and I got it
back for you.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.676
Would you consider me the thief?

00:42.710 --> 00:44.378
How did you get it back?

00:44.412 --> 00:47.215
Would that really be
the question you'd ask?

00:50.551 --> 00:52.353
(sighs)

00:52.386 --> 00:54.155
Pop had a scare with his heart

00:54.188 --> 00:56.590
that seems to have kicked a hole
in the wall.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.759
I've been wide awake
at 4:00 in the morning

00:58.792 --> 01:00.594
five nights in a row.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.696
I worry about all of them.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.732
I'm old enough
and wise enough to know

01:04.765 --> 01:06.800
there's not a damn thing
I can do,

01:06.834 --> 01:10.338
but that just doesn't cut it
in the middle of the night.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.573
They gave me pills over
there you could sleep

01:12.606 --> 01:14.608
through the night on the
Coney Island express.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.410
I got plenty more,
you want some.

01:16.444 --> 01:19.547
I think I'll just stick
to warm milk and whiskey.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.549
Well, they busted him for it,

01:21.582 --> 01:23.684
but Donald Rumsfeld
had it right.

01:23.717 --> 01:27.221
That whole notion
of known unknowns.

01:27.255 --> 01:30.691
Yeah, that's what shakes you
awake at 4:00 in the morning.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.261
Well, I got plenty of unknowns.

01:33.294 --> 01:36.264
As always.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.765
(clears throat)

01:37.798 --> 01:40.401
Could I ask you one favor, boss?

01:42.803 --> 01:44.772
Shoot.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.841
Over there, I was
an NYPD detective

01:47.875 --> 01:49.777
working with
JTTF in Kabul.

01:49.810 --> 01:52.480
That's a title my dad can
tell his friends about.

01:52.513 --> 01:55.849
I guess the term "fixer"
doesn't quite cut it.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.251
Don't get me wrong.

01:57.285 --> 01:58.852
I'm not complaining.

01:58.886 --> 02:01.722
When my pop was commissioner,

02:01.755 --> 02:03.857
he had a head of Confidential
Investigations Squad.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.393
That work for you?

02:05.426 --> 02:06.794
Yes, sir.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.163
Whatever you find,

02:09.197 --> 02:11.232
for my eyes only.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.467
(clears throat)
Order of priority?

02:13.501 --> 02:16.537
The Internal Affairs leaks,

02:16.570 --> 02:18.772
ticket-fixing rumors
in the two-seven,

02:18.806 --> 02:20.274
Jamie's risk assessment

02:20.308 --> 02:22.543
regarding Noble Sanfino
and his family--

02:22.576 --> 02:24.578
and Erin.

02:25.846 --> 02:29.250
Her situation
with Jacob Krystal.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.486
Right away.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.260
(sighs)

02:40.594 --> 02:43.431
It's not that I don't
trust you. It's just...

02:43.464 --> 02:45.766
Look, would you lay 30 grand
down in cash

02:45.799 --> 02:48.369
on a car that you couldn't
even lay your eyes on?

02:48.402 --> 02:50.571
Oh, come on. My hands are tied,
my friend, all right?

02:50.604 --> 02:52.473
The car's still being prepped
in the shop, and...

02:52.506 --> 02:54.375
and insurance
regulations

02:54.408 --> 02:56.510
prohibit me
from bringing out the car...

02:56.544 --> 02:57.711
Look, just have somebody
bring the car around.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.448
What do you say? Come on.
I just want to kiss it hello.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.216
Oh, you're killing me, Dan.
You're killing me.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.817
Look, the car is yours,
but at this price,

03:03.851 --> 03:05.386
I gotta stick to
the terms, all right?

03:05.419 --> 03:07.555
Out-of-state
delivery, VIN,

03:07.588 --> 03:10.358
title not included--
boom... end of story.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.392
Sorry.

03:11.425 --> 03:14.228
That's the end of our story.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.796
All right, all right, all right.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.298
(sighs)

03:17.331 --> 03:18.466
Oof.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.001
All right, let me check one
thing, I'll be right back.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.636
All right, stay put,
have a cookie.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.672
Yeah, okay.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.377
(cell phone blipping)

03:31.945 --> 03:33.547
Siwicki, Tommy.
This guy you vouched for--

03:33.581 --> 03:34.648
give me a description.

03:34.682 --> 03:38.519
Eh, about, uh,
five-ten, 160 or so,

03:38.552 --> 03:40.521
brown hair,

03:40.554 --> 03:42.890
and-- what do you call it--
a-a widow's peak?

03:42.923 --> 03:45.359
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's him.

03:45.393 --> 03:48.662
Uh, all right, thanks.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.631
JACKIE:
Good boy.

03:58.939 --> 04:02.376
Whoo! Come to Papa!

04:02.410 --> 04:04.278
She's a beauty, huh?
Whoo!

04:04.312 --> 04:05.379
Look at this.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.914
Thank you.
You're welcome.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.549
Go, go, go, go, go.

04:10.884 --> 04:11.919
DANNY: Put your hands
against the car, please.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.387
Turn around.

04:13.421 --> 04:16.390
(siren wailing)

04:16.424 --> 04:17.291
Police!

04:17.325 --> 04:18.792
Put your hands
on the car!
Come on.

04:18.826 --> 04:19.927
Spread your legs.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.429
(sirens wailing)

04:21.462 --> 04:22.796
(tires screeching)

04:25.699 --> 04:27.368
Tommy Barrone,
you are under arrest

04:27.401 --> 04:28.369
for grand larceny auto

04:28.402 --> 04:32.406
and criminal possession
of stolen property.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.807
Ah...
I need some cuffs.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.075
Anyone got cuffs?

04:35.108 --> 04:36.410
You got the spiel down?

04:36.444 --> 04:37.678
JAMIE:
In my sleep.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.547
All right, now, they're bound
to have a few little curlicues

04:39.580 --> 04:40.381
of their own,

04:40.414 --> 04:42.950
but all boiler rooms
boil down to this:

04:42.983 --> 04:45.819
you're selling stocks
in companies that don't exist,

04:45.853 --> 04:46.987
or they're penny stocks

04:47.020 --> 04:49.490
that you're flogging off
as the next Apple.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.660
Right, it's all snake oil,
but it's $20 million worth

04:52.693 --> 04:55.596
of snake oil to the
Sanfinos and the Cavazzeres.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.565
What's the big get?

04:57.598 --> 04:59.433
You need to get a thumb drive
into their system

04:59.467 --> 05:01.635
and download
any transaction activity.

05:01.669 --> 05:02.736
Now, there's bound
to be a partition

05:02.770 --> 05:03.904
where they have
the whales

05:03.937 --> 05:04.972
that they're really churning.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.107
If you can get to that,
we are gold.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.943
Noble told me to talk
to a guy named Tesla.

05:09.977 --> 05:10.944
Johnny Tesla.

05:10.978 --> 05:11.945
Yeah.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.914
He runs the shop.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.949
He's a made guy
in the Cavazzere family

05:15.983 --> 05:18.352
and he's also
a real bad-ass,

05:18.386 --> 05:19.987
so when you get
that download,

05:20.020 --> 05:21.522
you start planning
your exit strategy.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.656
Like?

05:22.690 --> 05:24.792
Like, I don't know,
the commute's too far,

05:24.825 --> 05:25.893
you got another job offer,

05:25.926 --> 05:26.894
something
forgettable.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.596
The bottom line--
you're not going

05:28.629 --> 05:30.364
for employee-of-the-month
Cadillac.

05:32.733 --> 05:33.834
All right, look,

05:33.867 --> 05:36.737
I got backup in the area,
but when you're in that shop,

05:36.770 --> 05:38.806
you're on your own,
so be careful.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.509
I'll be in touch.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.016
Vanna...

05:49.049 --> 05:51.685
would you please tell
Mr. Tommy Barrone
what he has won?

05:51.719 --> 05:52.520
All right.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.423
Well, it's not going
to be the trip

05:55.456 --> 05:57.425
that you've been dreaming of
for him.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.493
What are you talking about?

05:59.527 --> 06:01.028
His lawyers cut a deal.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.295
Reduced charges

06:02.329 --> 06:06.600
in exchange for his cooperation
in a couple cold-case homicides.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.168
Tommy Barrone Jr.
is going to give up

06:08.201 --> 06:11.672
two murders so he can walk
on car theft charges?

06:11.705 --> 06:15.409
No, not him-- Tommy Barrone Sr.

06:15.443 --> 06:18.546
Ah.
He's serving
five consecutive life sentences

06:18.579 --> 06:20.914
for contract murders
up in Sing Sing,

06:20.948 --> 06:23.016
so he's giving us
a couple oldies but goodies

06:23.050 --> 06:24.752
to cut his kid a break.

06:24.785 --> 06:25.853
You know, not for nothing,

06:25.886 --> 06:28.856
but this little operation burned
a lot of informants,

06:28.889 --> 06:30.791
not to mention hundreds
of man hours.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.926
For which you will notch
a couple homicides

06:32.960 --> 06:35.729
on your bedpost
without even breaking a sweat.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.531
I will? How so?
Mm-hmm.

06:37.565 --> 06:41.535
Our investigators have
debriefed him, but the cases are

06:41.569 --> 06:44.104
six and eight years old,
and Barrone is a little off

06:44.137 --> 06:46.774
on the exact locations of where
the bodies were discovered.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.810
Okay, so what does this have
to do with me?

06:49.843 --> 06:52.946
So, for the confessions
to be admissible in court,

06:52.980 --> 06:54.948
he needs to give us
the exact locations

06:54.982 --> 06:57.084
of where the bodies
were found

06:57.117 --> 06:59.052
as contained
in the original police reports,

06:59.086 --> 07:00.854
so I need you to hold his hand

07:00.888 --> 07:02.756
on a little walk
down memory lane.

07:02.790 --> 07:06.760
No, you need me to take Tommy
Barrone Sr. on a drive-around?

07:06.794 --> 07:07.828
Yeah, that's the plan.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.097
Well, how do I do that
without breaking a sweat?

07:10.130 --> 07:11.699
Well, you're going
to have your partner.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.867
Barrone will be in
handcuffs and leg irons.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.169
Yeah, and he's gonna be a guy in
a backseat with nothing to lose.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.671
I'm gonna be the guy
in the front seat

07:17.705 --> 07:18.672
with everything to lose.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.508
I don't know about you,
but that makes me sweat.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.105
Dr. Grossman, when I tell you
this stock is going to 20,

07:52.139 --> 07:53.340
I'm biting my lip
on the real target.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.275
John-- may I call you John?
Branatech is about to explode.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.810
After the bell,
this FDA thing comes out,

07:56.844 --> 07:58.111
you can say good-bye
to eight bucks a share.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.814
Okay, Mr. Egbert,
can you hold on just one second?

08:00.848 --> 08:03.083
A colleague of mine is
handing me an update just now.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.084
What?

08:04.117 --> 08:06.019
First name.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.221
Steve-- I'm back, Steve,
and this is news to me.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.623
You're getting it in real time

08:09.657 --> 08:11.124
just like I am.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.060
Branatech has just announced
that the protocol

08:13.093 --> 08:16.530
for their anti-Alzheimer's drug
has just...

08:16.564 --> 08:17.531
My home phone number?

08:17.565 --> 08:18.732
Sure, but I'm at the office.

08:20.133 --> 08:24.605
Okay, why don't you have
your mommy come pick you up?

08:24.638 --> 08:27.107
I can't, she's dead.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.642
It's a figure of speech.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.177
Why'd you hang up my call?

08:30.210 --> 08:31.779
They ask for your home number,
you're done.

08:31.812 --> 08:32.680
I had him
in the palm of my hand.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.548
You had nothing--
that's what you had.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.216
You told Sanfino
you'd done this before.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.084
I have.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.920
So why do I feel
like I'm babysitting?

08:39.953 --> 08:40.854
I need this job.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.823
Next number on your lead sheet.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.926
Just dial it.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.661
I closed on
10,000 shares.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.929
You got to admit,
it's a start.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.664
Yeah, your commission goes
to me, you know.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.665
What?

08:51.699 --> 08:54.768
I break you in, I get
your first ten milkshakes.

08:54.802 --> 08:55.836
Noble didn't say
anything about--

08:55.869 --> 08:57.104
Yeah, well,
what Noble doesn't know

08:57.137 --> 08:58.739
could fill the Meadowlands,
all right?

08:58.772 --> 09:00.741
You don't like it,
you can stay home.

09:06.847 --> 09:07.715
Bianca.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.217
My brother told me
he got you in here.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.019
Can't tell you how
disappointed I am.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.020
Nice to see you, too.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.688
I figured you for some
kind of professional,

09:14.722 --> 09:16.289
not working in
this monkey house.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.126
What are you doing here?

09:19.159 --> 09:22.262
Letting you take me
out for a drink.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.599
All right.
All right.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.284
(phone ringing)

09:45.819 --> 09:47.788
(sighs)

09:47.821 --> 09:50.290
Erin Reagan.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.659
Jacob Krystal.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.128
I need you to meet me.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.298
That is not a good idea.

09:58.331 --> 10:01.935
How? Emotionally,
logistically, legally?

10:01.969 --> 10:04.304
All of the above.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.074
I want to prove to you
that I am who I say I am.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.878
Well, can you prove that
you did not steal that painting?

10:10.911 --> 10:12.312
I can't prove a negative--

10:12.345 --> 10:15.115
no-- but I did not take
anything from that museum.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.616
Will you meet me?

10:19.687 --> 10:21.655
I can't. Not tonight.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.691
Then I'll be in touch.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.663
You and Tesla,
seriously?

10:29.697 --> 10:32.966
Seriously in that, yes,
I dated him a little.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.035
Nothing serious in
how much I liked it.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.238
What's with the face?

10:38.271 --> 10:39.940
No face.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.308
Yeah, a face,

10:41.341 --> 10:44.077
like you disapprove
I dated Johnny Tesla.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.079
It's none of my business.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.247
Sure as hell isn't.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.351
I don't see a ring.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.020
You the kind that
takes it off?

10:53.053 --> 10:54.254
You mean, am I married?

10:54.287 --> 10:55.255
No.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.189
Girlfriend?

10:56.223 --> 10:57.390
No.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.926
Friends with benefits?

10:58.959 --> 11:00.260
What's up with you?

11:00.293 --> 11:01.829
Just answer the question.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.363
None of your business.

11:03.396 --> 11:06.233
What if I want to make it
my business?

11:06.266 --> 11:08.235
Line forms to the right.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.904
(chuckles)

11:10.938 --> 11:12.973
BIANCA: So not even
"Happy birthday"?

11:13.006 --> 11:13.874
Really?

11:13.907 --> 11:16.176
I mean, if you want
to do happy birthday.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.878
Okay, you'll sing
happy birthday?

11:17.911 --> 11:19.179
(both chuckle)

11:19.212 --> 11:20.981
You talk a big game.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.784
Makes you wonder
what you really got.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.403
Nice.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.137
Johnny, what...?

11:44.171 --> 11:46.239
Shut up, Bianca,
just shut up!

11:46.273 --> 11:47.808
What are you, stalking me?

11:47.841 --> 11:48.641
Yeah, you wish.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.443
I wish?!
What's the matter with you?

11:50.477 --> 11:53.046
You might want
to check your neck, Riordan.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.214
She's a real vampire.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.482
Why don't we all
just walk away here?

11:55.515 --> 11:57.951
That's a good idea.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.387
(scraping)
BIANCA:
Oh!

12:01.789 --> 12:03.023
Up yours, Johnny!

12:16.536 --> 12:18.238
Hey.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.172
Hey!

12:19.206 --> 12:20.307
Hey-hey.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.308
Sam Croft.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.175
How are ya?

12:22.209 --> 12:24.077
I'm good, Danny.
Back in the bosom, huh?

12:24.111 --> 12:25.178
Yeah, how's Linda
and the boys?

12:25.212 --> 12:28.381
Eh, you know, Linda's good.
Pain in the neck as usual.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.217
The boys are growing up
too fast; life is good.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.184
All right.
Here.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.052
Hey, Gramps.
Thank you.

12:32.085 --> 12:32.986
Sam, refill?

12:33.020 --> 12:34.121
Henry, you're on the mend.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.256
I don't want you waiting on me,
okay? That's an order.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.490
My house, my bar.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.192
I'm good for now. Thank you.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.895
So, is my dad keeping
you busy already?

12:41.929 --> 12:43.330
I'm wrapping him up easy.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.232
What do you got going on?

12:45.265 --> 12:47.300
I got a take-out order
day after tomorrow.

12:47.334 --> 12:50.470
I got to take this lifer for
a drive and see if I can I.D.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.205
the location of
these bodies he dumped.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.541
Of course, he says he can't
tell us by memory, so we're

12:54.574 --> 12:56.343
gonna canvass the neighborhood,
see if we can find 'em.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.845
Otherwise, his confession's

12:57.878 --> 12:59.279
certainly not gonna
hold up in court.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.347
Who's your guy?

13:00.380 --> 13:02.415
Tommy Barrone, Sr.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.484
Out of Sing-Sing?

13:04.517 --> 13:05.418
What, you know him?

13:05.452 --> 13:08.421
Not personally,
but I remember his trial.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.390
Half the jurors had
to be removed

13:10.423 --> 13:12.125
from the courtroom during
his testimony

13:12.159 --> 13:13.927
because they got sick
to their stomach.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.195
Guy's as brutal as they come.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.363
Great.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.131
Jackie supposed to ride
along with us?

13:18.165 --> 13:20.100
That's the plan as of now.

13:20.133 --> 13:24.237
Well, the guy hasn't been within
20 yards of a woman in years.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.538
That could complicate things.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.074
Yeah, I think you're right.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.876
Sam, I'd like you
to ride shotgun.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.012
That okay with you?

13:32.045 --> 13:33.446
It's fine by me.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.815
Be like rookies all over again.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.585
Better not be.
It ain't rookie duty.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.030
Hi, hi, hi!

13:50.063 --> 13:51.098
Hi, Sam!

13:51.131 --> 13:53.100
There she is.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.201
Hot, fresh, and delicious.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.069
Plus I brought pizza.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.538
I'll help you out with that.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.510
(chuckles)

14:07.547 --> 14:09.649
And Nicky's... what now?

14:09.682 --> 14:12.986
15 going on 30.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.387
How are you making out?

14:14.421 --> 14:18.391
Hanging in there.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.093
Can I ask you a favor?

14:20.127 --> 14:22.095
Yeah, sure.

14:22.129 --> 14:26.366
I know that you're Dad's fixer.

14:26.399 --> 14:30.537
It wasn't a question.

14:30.570 --> 14:34.541
Can you separate fact
from fiction on this guy?

14:34.574 --> 14:36.209
Everything I know, I wrote down.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.480
Yeah, if I can.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.115
Can you keep it between us?

14:42.149 --> 14:44.551
I don't really want
my dad involved.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.353
I work for him.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.055
I know.

14:48.088 --> 14:52.292
So maybe on your own time,
as a favor to an old friend?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.563
Yeah.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.045
GUARD:
...coming out!

15:12.079 --> 15:14.214
Hey, fellas-- Tommy Barrone.

15:14.247 --> 15:17.050
Tommy Barrone,
Detective Reagan,
Detective Croft.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.252
Nice day for
a drive, huh?

15:19.286 --> 15:21.088
That goes for any day
for you.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.422
Man's got a point.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.091
Tommy, as you know,
I'll be escorting you

15:24.124 --> 15:25.158
to two locations in
Brooklyn and Queens

15:25.192 --> 15:28.061
for you to give us the exact
details of the homicides

15:28.095 --> 15:29.963
you're cooperating on.
Is that your understanding?

15:29.997 --> 15:31.231
Anything for my boy.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.666
Great. We'll be taking notes on
any and all details you provide.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.069
At the end of our trip you will
be asked to verify

15:36.103 --> 15:36.736
those notes as accurate.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.971
Do you understand?
Yes.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.672
Phenomenal. Let's go.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.342
I got one question.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.444
I figure this a minimum
five, six hours?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.513
I'm gonna need to use the
facilities at some point.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.314
Yeah, so?

15:47.347 --> 15:49.349
So you two guys
gonna draw straws

15:49.382 --> 15:51.051
as to gets to hold the johnson?

15:52.285 --> 15:54.154
Get in.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.756
Scoot over. All the way.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.658
(chuckles)
Yes, sir!

16:04.131 --> 16:06.099
And he sits across from me

16:06.133 --> 16:07.734
and he never takes his eyes
off me.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.403
I'm sure I'll find an opening,
but so far it's a no-go.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.239
There's a USB port, yes?

16:12.272 --> 16:14.174
Yeah, but they're from, like,
five years ago.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.076
I might need some time
to download a database.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.110
Well, buy it somehow.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.111
And Detective...

16:18.145 --> 16:19.279
Noble's sister showed up.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.681
I met her before.
We had a drink.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.516
And this concerns me how?

16:23.550 --> 16:26.519
Well, she's pretty hot
and she knows it,

16:26.553 --> 16:29.489
and it's gonna look weird if
just blow her off, you know?

16:29.522 --> 16:31.658
And then she'd go, you know,
"What's wrong with this guy?

16:31.691 --> 16:33.260
Is he married or gay or what?"

16:33.293 --> 16:36.096
She starts snooping around
and opens up a can of worms.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.364
If a picture turns up
on Google or...

16:37.397 --> 16:41.134
Reagan, the only thing I want
you inserting into another thing

16:41.168 --> 16:43.236
is a thumb drive
into a computer,

16:43.270 --> 16:44.471
That's not what I'm saying.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.707
But if I just freeze her out,
it's gonna raise questions.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.114
Only Apple sells itself,
and we ain't selling Apple.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.623
I ever tell you about the guy
wanted me to whack his wife?

17:03.656 --> 17:05.158
You never told us anything.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.693
We just picked you up
an hour ago.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.561
Right, sorry.

17:08.595 --> 17:12.099
Anyway, this individual contacts
me, he's taken out insurance

17:12.132 --> 17:14.467
on his wife, wants me
to show up on Riverside Drive

17:14.501 --> 17:17.137
on such and such
a night...
All due respect,
Tommy.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.738
We're about to pull up
on the intersection

17:18.771 --> 17:20.307
of Greenpoint
and Henry.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.675
Yeah, right. We're looking
for a '50s kind of diner

17:22.709 --> 17:24.411
just past a sanitation depot.

17:24.444 --> 17:27.214
You mean, like that the diner
up there, ahead on the right?

17:27.247 --> 17:29.516
Yeah, that's it.
Make a right.
Hold on.

17:29.549 --> 17:33.153
There should be a vacant lot
middle of that block.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.354
That's what we're looking for.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.489
Central,
Manhattan South Detectives

17:36.523 --> 17:38.725
requesting 10-85,
no emergency,

17:38.758 --> 17:40.427
one additional unit re: backup.

17:40.460 --> 17:45.165
Front of 123 Diamond Street.
Thank you.

17:45.198 --> 17:48.735
Seriously? You guys must think
I'm some kind of Harry Houdini.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.338
No, we just happen to think
you're a sociopath

17:51.371 --> 17:53.373
who wouldn't hesitate
to take out two cops,

17:53.406 --> 17:56.509
if he thought it meant he had
a chance to make a run for it.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.411
Yes, we wear
our suspicions on our sleeves.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.180
Hey, I wear my suspicion
on my face.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.848
I never had anything
to do with killing cops.

18:01.881 --> 18:02.815
You can look that up.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.452
If we could look up
every hit you ever made,

18:05.485 --> 18:07.220
we wouldn't be driving around
doing all this rigmarole.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.489
All right, point taken.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.625
But on my mother's grave,
99% of the jobs I did,

18:12.659 --> 18:15.795
you both would call
"public service," believe me.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.364
DANNY:
Yeah, I'm sure we would.

18:22.669 --> 18:26.273
He was still alive in the trunk
when I got here from Huntington.

18:26.306 --> 18:29.242
I got him out of the car,
put a couple in his head

18:29.276 --> 18:30.477
on the ground,
right about here.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.644
Right here, huh?

18:31.678 --> 18:34.247
Maybe a bullet went right
through they might've found.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.515
Oh, they found it, all right.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.749
Now for the grand prize,

18:36.783 --> 18:38.918
we need to know what caliber
the rounds you put in his head

18:38.951 --> 18:40.387
and whereabouts they would
have found the body.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.921
Always a .45 for me,

18:41.954 --> 18:44.791
and I put him in a Dumpster
was over there.

18:44.824 --> 18:45.825
Right over there.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.727
The diner must've
been using it,

18:47.760 --> 18:49.596
'cause it stunk
of old souvlaki.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.198
Sound about right?

18:51.231 --> 18:52.532
That's right.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.533
There you go.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.534
You passed
with flying colors.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.535
Congratulations.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.803
I gotta pee.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.305
Too bad. Let's go.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.340
We gotta eat, right?

19:00.373 --> 19:01.774
There's a restaurant,
right over there

19:01.808 --> 19:03.676
about six blocks,
La Dolce Notte.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.378
Best veal parm
you ever had.

19:05.412 --> 19:06.679
Really? I love veal parm.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.181
I'm gonna have
to remember that.

19:08.215 --> 19:10.283
Take the wife one night.
What's wrong with today?

19:10.317 --> 19:11.684
What's wrong with today
is you suggested it.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.186
What do you think,
we're stupid enough

19:13.220 --> 19:14.321
to go showing up over there

19:14.354 --> 19:15.555
and wait for some
of your friends

19:15.588 --> 19:17.357
to jump out out on us?
Forget about it.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.958
You think
too much of me.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.960
Take it as a compliment.
Yeah, right.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.363
No, no, Ron, does your wife call
you every time

19:23.396 --> 19:25.698
she spots a deal
at the, uh...?

19:25.732 --> 19:27.667
I'm not saying it's
the same thing, just that--

19:27.700 --> 19:29.469
(dial tone)

19:29.502 --> 19:31.904
Ron? Ron?

19:34.874 --> 19:37.210
Sounds like Ron closed you.

19:37.244 --> 19:41.248
It's not the way
it's supposed to work.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.416
How long you been doing Bianca?

19:43.450 --> 19:45.818
I'm not doing Bianca.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.455
Hey, Jimmy!
Hey.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.989
Johnny, how is my man
making out, huh?

19:50.022 --> 19:51.724
How well do you know this child?

19:51.758 --> 19:54.761
Uh, well enough
to send him to you. Why?

19:54.794 --> 19:56.263
'Cause I just want to know

19:56.296 --> 19:58.398
if he's another toy of Bianca's
I got saddled with

19:58.431 --> 20:01.501
before she moves on and I've
wasted a week on training him.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.870
(scoffs)
What is he talking about?

20:03.903 --> 20:05.338
I'll tell you what
I'm talking abo--

20:05.372 --> 20:08.641
No, no, no, I'm asking him.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.510
She came by, we had a drink...

20:10.543 --> 20:12.645
We sucked face outside
of Skyrockets...

20:16.649 --> 20:19.486
It just happened.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.354
It just, it just,
it just happened.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.427
No, no, see,that,
that just happened!

20:27.460 --> 20:28.761
You get back to work!

20:28.795 --> 20:31.331
You and Bianca would've taken

20:31.364 --> 20:34.701
a little more thought
first, right?

20:34.734 --> 20:36.303
Noble, I'm sorry,
I didn't think that...

20:36.336 --> 20:39.272
Exactly, exactly,
you didn't think.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.940
You didn't think to say
something to me?

20:42.375 --> 20:44.477
Noble, how would you feel if...?

20:44.511 --> 20:48.281
Would it be okay if,
would it mess things up if? No?

20:48.315 --> 20:49.716
I'm sorry.

20:49.749 --> 20:53.420
Hey...

20:53.453 --> 20:56.823
she's my sister;
I know how she can get, but...

20:58.825 --> 21:01.060
Jimmy, can you do me a favor
and go grab a coffee?

21:01.093 --> 21:01.994
'Cause Johnny and I got

21:02.028 --> 21:04.331
a couple things
that we gotta talk about.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.302
All right.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.711
So this guy...
Mm-hmm.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.046
calls back
a few days later.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.949
Wants me to off
the wife and his two kids

21:22.982 --> 21:24.951
who are gonna be in
the car with her.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.085
You're kidding me.

21:26.118 --> 21:26.853
Nope, a wife.

21:26.886 --> 21:30.457
Now we all know
that could be

21:30.490 --> 21:34.361
a complicated relationship,
but your own kids? Thanks.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.696
You do it?

21:36.729 --> 21:38.431
Course I didn't.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.833
What I was gonna do
was take him out,

21:40.867 --> 21:42.569
do his family a favor.

21:42.602 --> 21:43.803
But...?

21:43.836 --> 21:46.706
I got called out on a couple
jobs in the Midwest.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.441
Uh-huh.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.909
So whatever
happened to this guy?

21:49.942 --> 21:52.479
You remember a woman
and her two kids got killed

21:52.512 --> 21:55.081
when a garbage truck went
out of control on Riverside,

21:55.114 --> 21:56.983
crushed their car,
Mm-hmm.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.451
about five years ago?

21:58.485 --> 21:59.786
They closed it as an accident?

22:01.654 --> 22:02.889
That was that?

22:02.922 --> 22:05.525
You want the guy
who did the hit?

22:05.558 --> 22:07.427
Yeah, I want to know.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.995
What's the catch?

22:09.028 --> 22:12.499
Maybe you could arrange for me
to meet up with my boy.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.668
I'd like to give him
a kiss and a hug

22:15.702 --> 22:17.704
without that Plexiglas
in between.

22:19.138 --> 22:20.473
Please.

22:20.507 --> 22:21.874
It's the last chance
I'll ever get.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.876
It's not a negotiation.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.011
Come on.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.413
It's almost Christmas.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.381
What, I look like
Santa Claus to you?

22:31.718 --> 22:33.820
Gentlemen, allow me
to welcome you

22:33.853 --> 22:35.154
to One Police Plaza.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.656
(translates in Japanese)

22:39.191 --> 22:41.428
And I am honored
that the mayor thought

22:41.461 --> 22:43.463
to have me give you
a personal tour.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.497
(translating in Japanese)

22:44.531 --> 22:47.033
(cell phone ringing)

22:47.066 --> 22:48.435
Excuse me one minute.

22:48.468 --> 22:49.602
(speaks Japanese)

22:50.603 --> 22:53.039
(speaking Japanese)

22:55.074 --> 22:56.776
Reagan.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.811
Both sources are highly
credible, Commissioner,

22:58.845 --> 23:00.713
and they both say
the same thing--

23:00.747 --> 23:02.849
there's no doubt that
Jacob Krystal is involved,

23:02.882 --> 23:05.084
but that he's smarter than
the people trying to catch him.

23:05.117 --> 23:05.985
And there's no evidence.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.520
So far.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.755
So far, yeah.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.457
But still,
no outstanding warrants

23:10.490 --> 23:11.724
or restricted entry

23:11.758 --> 23:12.792
to other countries.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.060
Nope.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.762
Innocent till proven guilty.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.029
Yeah, as they say.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.098
Thanks, Sam.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.933
(sighs)

23:20.967 --> 23:22.469
Mind your head.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.937
Slide all the way over.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.205
There you go.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.540
Go ahead.

23:27.574 --> 23:28.808
(horn honks)

23:28.841 --> 23:31.210
(car door closes)

23:31.243 --> 23:34.180
Hey, you notice that Toyota
go by back at the lot?

23:34.213 --> 23:35.815
Every third car
in this borough

23:35.848 --> 23:37.484
is a silver
late-model Toyota.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.586
You saying I'm paranoid?

23:39.619 --> 23:41.153
I got the plates for both--
they're different cars.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.555
Come on.
You ready to roll?

23:42.589 --> 23:43.690
Yeah.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.997
Here you go.
Thank you.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.101
If anyone's watching,

23:55.134 --> 23:57.637
it's not going to matter
how fast you're walking.

23:57.670 --> 23:58.871
Hi.
Hi.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.239
You said you had proof.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.340
What's the proof?

24:01.373 --> 24:04.577
When I met you, I told you
I was an art appraiser.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.579
Yes, but you left
some things out.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.180
A work of art can be appraised

24:08.214 --> 24:10.983
for market value,
authenticity, condition...

24:11.017 --> 24:12.118
Portability.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.253
(chuckles)
And provenance.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.255
Who is the rightful owner
of the piece?

24:16.288 --> 24:18.124
That's my area of expertise.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.759
And I'm not a thief.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.928
Well, a lot of people
think you are.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.129
Are you one of them?

24:23.162 --> 24:25.264
Does it really matter
what I think?

24:25.297 --> 24:26.799
Yes.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.001
You're a born cynic,
and I like a challenge.

24:30.036 --> 24:31.604
What is this?

24:31.638 --> 24:33.540
You had me followed?
What? No.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.912
What-what do you see?

24:45.985 --> 24:47.754
Look, the only case
this stuff supports

24:47.787 --> 24:49.622
is the one he's making
for himself,

24:49.656 --> 24:51.891
which, by definition,
is just half the story.

24:51.924 --> 24:54.060
But he's never been charged,
much less convicted,

24:54.093 --> 24:55.795
in any of those heists.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.129
Look at this.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.666
It's a copy of the INTERPOL
memo identifying him

24:59.699 --> 25:01.100
only as the appraiser
that called attention

25:01.133 --> 25:02.969
to the provenance of
the stolen painting.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.236
That's it.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.172
Yeah, but this
Scotland Yard workup

25:06.205 --> 25:08.808
could support a pretty strong
conspiracy theory.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.778
That they never gathered
any evidence to act on.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.846
(sighs)

25:16.015 --> 25:17.750
What did Sam Croft find out?

25:22.154 --> 25:25.224
Sam never came up with anything
more than what we got here.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.995
I had a feeling that you
had gotten to him first.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.529
Yes, I did.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.967
Look, even if he's
telling the truth,

25:35.001 --> 25:37.837
there is no such thing
as a Robin Hood defense,

25:37.870 --> 25:39.639
so at least it's conspiracy.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.874
Did he send you
this stuff,

25:41.908 --> 25:43.576
or did he hand it to you?

25:43.610 --> 25:45.845
I saw him earlier.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.279
Erin, I don't have to tell you,

25:47.313 --> 25:49.616
if you're questioned--
No, you don't, Dad.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.083
If a detective
wants to question me,

25:51.117 --> 25:54.220
I'll give him everything I got,
which is nothing.

25:56.288 --> 25:59.692
You know, when you look at me,
do you still see a wild child,

25:59.726 --> 26:02.629
or do you see a 36-year-old
woman, mother and lawyer?

26:02.662 --> 26:04.631
That's a trick question.

26:04.664 --> 26:05.998
But both.

26:06.032 --> 26:08.367
I didn't appreciate it
when you used to snoop around

26:08.400 --> 26:10.202
on me when I was sowing my oats,

26:10.236 --> 26:12.038
but at least, then,
I could understand it.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.572
But now?

26:15.675 --> 26:17.910
(sighs)

26:25.985 --> 26:28.154
Why you turning?
I told you further up,

26:28.187 --> 26:29.221
off Jackson.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.623
Don't worry about it.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.664
We're getting an oil change?

26:37.697 --> 26:40.066
No.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.201
Christmas might be coming
a little early for you.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.005
Tell me about Riverside.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.675
They brought in the driver
of the garbage truck.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.242
He told them
he was epileptic.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.211
Doctor's reports and everything.

26:52.244 --> 26:53.412
Told them
he had a seizure,

26:53.445 --> 26:54.881
lost control
of the vehicle.

26:54.914 --> 26:57.784
Guy was no more epileptic
than I am.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.051
He was the hitter.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.687
Okay. What's the proof on that?

27:00.720 --> 27:04.023
Track down the doctor who
diagnosed him with the epilepsy.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.324
And what's the doctor
going to tell me?

27:05.357 --> 27:07.293
Nothing-- he doesn't exist,

27:07.326 --> 27:10.229
except on a letterhead
out of a post office box

27:10.262 --> 27:12.932
in Staten Island.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.735
Now, can I see my boy?

27:17.269 --> 27:19.271
Let's go.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.351
Hello, Junior.

27:32.384 --> 27:35.121
Was a beautiful car, Junior.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.655
Sure would have been
nice to keep it.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.992
But I'm sure the guy
you stole it from

27:40.026 --> 27:41.260
is happy to have it back.

27:41.293 --> 27:42.862
Do me a favor--

27:42.895 --> 27:45.131
keep your hands where I
can see them at all times.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.398
Let's go.

27:46.432 --> 27:48.067
(laughing):
Hey.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.468
Let me look at you.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.237
Hey, Dad.

27:59.946 --> 28:01.914
You take care
of yourself.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.449
You hear me?

28:03.482 --> 28:04.951
I love you.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.919
JUNIOR:
Love you, too.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.223
No, he was on the...

28:11.257 --> 28:12.358
Hey, Vincent.

28:12.391 --> 28:13.860
Yeah.
Give us a minute?

28:13.893 --> 28:15.027
Sure.

28:15.061 --> 28:16.362
See you later.
Yeah.

28:16.395 --> 28:18.197
Hey.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.500
You gotta understand
something, okay?

28:21.533 --> 28:24.103
Look, Tesla--
he's like...

28:24.136 --> 28:26.205
when you were kids, the
friend that you'd find

28:26.238 --> 28:27.506
going through your
sister's underwear drawer

28:27.539 --> 28:29.375
when he said he was
getting a soda.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.412
Okay? And then
he grows up,

28:33.445 --> 28:35.381
and he gets his shot
with her, and...

28:35.414 --> 28:37.383
(snickers)

28:37.416 --> 28:39.418
Bam, he got shot down.

28:40.987 --> 28:42.488
Got it.
Okay.

28:42.521 --> 28:45.024
But you might want to show
him a little bit of respect,

28:45.057 --> 28:46.859
if you want to make
some money around here.

28:48.227 --> 28:51.764
Oh, and Jimmy,
you make a move,

28:51.798 --> 28:54.767
just check with me, okay?

28:54.801 --> 28:56.769
I'm the guy with the map.

28:56.803 --> 28:59.338
(cell phone buzzing)

28:59.371 --> 29:01.373
Bianca.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.845
(laughing)

29:07.847 --> 29:09.315
I'm here with your brother.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.250
Lucky you.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.886
I got my appetite back.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.455
Yeah, well, I don't think it's
such a good idea that we--

29:16.488 --> 29:19.025
If this is about Tesla,
he doesn't own me.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.527
Look, let's just
forget it, okay?

29:21.560 --> 29:23.029
Timing's bad for me.

29:24.897 --> 29:26.298
Fine.

29:26.332 --> 29:28.334
You got it.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.437
Okay, hey, don't
get me wrong--

29:31.470 --> 29:33.405
I'm not trying to
tell you what to do.

29:33.439 --> 29:34.807
You... you know
that, right?

29:34.841 --> 29:35.842
It's not like...

29:35.875 --> 29:37.243
I'm going out for a smoke.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.544
Break's over.

29:42.248 --> 29:44.216
Come here.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.585
Just hang in there, okay?

29:46.618 --> 29:48.387
Let's do something
this weekend.

29:53.559 --> 29:54.360
All right, those are my notes.

29:54.393 --> 29:55.995
Sam's going to read them
out to you.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.063
You got it.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.398
Could we go for one drink
before you put me back?

29:59.431 --> 30:02.034
No, we can't go for one drink
before we put you back.

30:02.068 --> 30:03.936
One beer.
No.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.237
Sam's going to
read you my notes.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.338
If you hear anything
that doesn't jive

30:06.372 --> 30:09.175
with what you said, you
call it out, we'll fix it.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.509
Okay.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.011
But one beer.

30:31.397 --> 30:34.333
Ted, this is Jimmy Riordan
at Cardicott Capital.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.972
JAMIE:
Yes, absolutely.

30:48.214 --> 30:49.949
I believe you spoke
to an associate of mine

30:49.982 --> 30:51.984
last week about an opportunity
in Branatech.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.959
Yeah, can I have a few more
moments of your time right now?

31:12.704 --> 31:15.474
Okay, I'll call back
in an hour, then.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.645
Everything cool?

31:19.678 --> 31:20.980
I don't know-- you tell me.

31:21.013 --> 31:22.481
I'm cool.

31:22.514 --> 31:25.151
Something wrong
with your computer?
No.

31:25.184 --> 31:26.953
Why were you feeling it up
just then?

31:26.986 --> 31:28.087
What are you talking about?

31:29.488 --> 31:31.357
You waiting
for walk-in business?

31:31.390 --> 31:32.992
Get on the phone.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.635
Second body was in
the cargo hold

31:43.669 --> 31:45.972
of a motor coach,
not of a school bus.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.239
DANNY:
Oh, okay.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.241
My mistake.
Sam, you mind fixing that?

31:49.275 --> 31:50.376
Yeah. Done.

31:50.409 --> 31:51.677
There--
we all in agreement now?

31:51.710 --> 31:52.911
BARRONE:
Signed, sealed, delivered.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.548
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

31:58.317 --> 32:00.586
Hang on, guys. We got company.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.288
DANNY:
Hold on!

32:09.461 --> 32:12.031
Damn it!

32:12.064 --> 32:13.499
(tires squealing)

32:14.733 --> 32:15.968
Get down! Stay down!

32:16.002 --> 32:16.435
Danny, look out!

32:22.374 --> 32:23.942
Go! Go!

32:53.172 --> 32:55.174
(horn blaring)

32:58.410 --> 33:00.512
Call for backup!

33:00.546 --> 33:04.283
10-13, shots fired.
We need backup, forthwith!

33:04.316 --> 33:05.751
We're at the underpass
of Bruckner and Fifth.
Hey.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.086
Hey.

33:07.119 --> 33:08.520
You okay?
Yeah.

33:08.554 --> 33:09.521
You're not hit?
No.

33:09.555 --> 33:10.522
You sure?
Yeah.

33:10.556 --> 33:11.523
Okay, good.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.259
Ow! God...!

33:13.292 --> 33:15.494
I take you to see your kid,
and that's how you pay me back?

33:15.527 --> 33:17.463
You can't blame
a guy for trying.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.244
Hey, Riordan.
Wait up.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.147
I said wait up.

33:37.549 --> 33:40.552
I got a date in the city,
and no, not with Bianca.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.354
Yeah, I think you got something
doesn't belong to you.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.190
What are you talking about?

33:44.223 --> 33:46.292
I think you ripped a copy
of the client list.

33:46.325 --> 33:47.526
Maybe you don't like it here

33:47.559 --> 33:49.195
but you don't want to
leave empty-handed.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.329
You're talking crap.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.364
Yeah.

33:52.398 --> 33:53.632
Empty your pockets.

34:04.776 --> 34:06.145
All right.
I'm going to frisk you.

34:06.178 --> 34:07.379
The hell you are.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.481
Get...

34:09.515 --> 34:10.116
You're outside the building.

34:10.149 --> 34:12.251
Got a right to search you.

34:21.227 --> 34:22.294
Enough!

34:23.495 --> 34:24.696
(grunting)

34:27.433 --> 34:28.667
Come on, come on...

34:28.700 --> 34:30.436
(grunts)

34:42.848 --> 34:45.151
What do you got, huh?

34:45.184 --> 34:46.718
What do you got?

34:51.490 --> 34:53.159
Well, lucky you.

34:57.329 --> 34:58.330
(coughs)

34:59.331 --> 35:01.700
He's all yours.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.435
Oh, one last thing.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.705
For what it's worth...
I'm sorry.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.340
Ah, it's not worth anything.

35:08.374 --> 35:09.375
You would've tried, too.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.612
I probably wouldn't have.

35:13.645 --> 35:14.746
But when'd you get the idea?

35:14.780 --> 35:16.848
Was it when you got me to
take you to see your son?

35:16.882 --> 35:18.517
Did you whisper
something in his ear?

35:18.550 --> 35:20.386
That was just
a father-son thing.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.488
Come on-- you didn't
signal him, nothing?

35:22.521 --> 35:23.722
This was set up days ago.

35:25.224 --> 35:27.259
They were Albanians, by the way.

35:27.293 --> 35:29.328
Only ones crazy enough
to take on cops.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.796
Do yourself a favor:

35:30.829 --> 35:33.165
watch out for the Albanians.

35:33.199 --> 35:34.666
Thanks for the tip.

35:35.934 --> 35:38.136
I'll see you around, Tommy.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.810
It's okay, boys.

35:44.843 --> 35:47.213
I had it coming.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.701
BIANCA:
What happened?

36:09.735 --> 36:10.969
What are you doing here?

36:11.002 --> 36:12.704
Not taking no for an answer.

36:12.738 --> 36:13.705
Who did this?

36:13.739 --> 36:14.740
Tesla.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.208
About me?

36:16.242 --> 36:17.443
Not that he said.

36:17.476 --> 36:19.711
We got to get
you to a hospital.

36:19.745 --> 36:21.713
Jimmy, you gotta
see a doctor.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.215
I asked you to
stay away, Bianca.

36:23.249 --> 36:24.783
Don't argue with me!

36:24.816 --> 36:26.952
So then just stay away.
Stop it!

36:26.985 --> 36:29.187
I mean it.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.525
Good-bye, Bianca.

36:49.975 --> 36:53.445
I'm just saying, next time I
deliver you a bird in the hand,

36:53.479 --> 36:55.547
don't send me out
to go beat the bushes.

36:55.581 --> 36:59.318
We got two closed homicides
out of it, maybe even three,

36:59.351 --> 37:00.886
if we find that
garbage truck driver.

37:00.919 --> 37:04.423
Yeah, but you're forgetting, we
almost had another homicide: me.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.394
Guess I owe you an apology.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.562
Or at least a good
bottle of Scotch.

37:13.999 --> 37:16.702
I'm sorry you were
put in harm's way

37:16.735 --> 37:18.270
for something I asked you to do.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.472
You see?
Now, was that so difficult?

37:20.506 --> 37:22.974
Yes... because the worse
I feel about something,

37:23.008 --> 37:24.976
the less I'm able
to admit to it.

37:28.046 --> 37:30.382
That's my kid sister.

37:31.750 --> 37:32.751
Thank you.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.890
Do you think Nicky can
hang out after dinner?

37:38.924 --> 37:41.026
I have an appointment in town.

37:41.059 --> 37:42.494
I can pick her up right after.

37:42.528 --> 37:44.496
Course.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.365
How about if I just keep
Nicky for the night?

37:46.398 --> 37:48.334
If memory serves,

37:48.367 --> 37:52.270
sometimes teenagers need a night
off from their parents, too.

37:55.807 --> 37:59.345
I'll just drop her at school
on my way to work.

37:59.378 --> 38:02.047
I think she'd like that.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.783
Done, then?

38:04.816 --> 38:08.286
Thank you.

38:23.469 --> 38:25.003
(sighs)

38:25.036 --> 38:26.438
How's the other guy look?

38:28.474 --> 38:29.875
Other two guys.

38:29.908 --> 38:31.610
There were two?

38:31.643 --> 38:34.112
Yep. They look
even cooler than me.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.682
And he didn't
cough up the evidence.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.950
It's a gift.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.619
I don't understand.

38:40.652 --> 38:41.987
Did he have to
swallow something?

38:42.020 --> 38:43.722
(all chuckling)

38:45.524 --> 38:48.994
Yeah, it was the...
secret code.

38:50.462 --> 38:53.732
I'll explain later.
Really? You did?

38:53.765 --> 38:56.468
Yeah. Apparently,
Uncle Jamie's been famous

38:56.502 --> 38:57.903
for swallowing things
since he was a kid.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.638
(snickering)
Mm-hmm.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.508
Like the, uh, Liberty head dimes
from my coin collection.

39:02.541 --> 39:05.010
(laughter)

39:05.043 --> 39:07.379
Guess where we found those.

39:07.413 --> 39:09.615
Ugh. Uncle Jamie?

39:09.648 --> 39:11.917
Mm-hmm. It's okay, though.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.985
Once I boiled them,
they were shiny and new.

39:14.019 --> 39:16.588
(guffawing)

39:16.622 --> 39:18.524
Come on, cut it out.
It hurts when I laugh.

39:18.557 --> 39:19.925
Of course.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.427
We're sorry.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.996
Oh...

39:25.030 --> 39:27.833
My confirmation locket...

39:27.866 --> 39:29.835
(laughing)

39:32.771 --> 39:34.773
It was so gross.

39:37.709 --> 39:38.944
Come on. I'm begging you.

39:38.977 --> 39:40.679
Yeah.

39:40.712 --> 39:41.713
Right.
Sorry.

39:43.449 --> 39:46.485
When he swallowed the key
to the liquor cabinet...

39:46.518 --> 39:48.920
(all laughing)
...that was pretty serious.

39:53.859 --> 39:56.094
Mom never did wear those
pearl earrings again.

39:59.798 --> 40:00.932
Ow...!

40:06.805 --> 40:08.807
(all laughing hysterically)

40:28.694 --> 40:29.961
Ms. Reagan...

40:33.732 --> 40:36.668
Detective.

40:36.702 --> 40:38.604
Care to fill me in?

40:38.637 --> 40:40.472
Well, turns out
he stood us both up.

40:41.573 --> 40:42.941
I just got word that
he flew out of Washington

40:42.974 --> 40:44.075
a couple hours ago.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.076
To where?

40:45.110 --> 40:46.878
Paris.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.516
So you were right,
and I was--

40:50.549 --> 40:52.484
Right, also.

40:52.518 --> 40:55.721
In that we still don't have
enough to flat-out arrest him.

40:55.754 --> 40:57.956
But we must be getting closer,

40:57.989 --> 40:59.558
for him to, uh, suddenly
flee the country.

41:00.726 --> 41:02.227
Well, some guys are
like that, you know?

41:02.260 --> 41:04.563
You get too close,
and they just...

41:09.568 --> 41:10.802
If you hear from him...

41:10.836 --> 41:13.672
You'll be the first to know.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.543
Well, thank you, Ms. Reagan.
