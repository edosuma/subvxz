WEBVTT

00:02.023 --> 00:05.183
Help her!
Would you go and get some help?

00:06.253 --> 00:07.733
Is that your daughter?
Yes.

00:07.772 --> 00:10.132
She's got herself tied up
with the Holts.

00:10.142 --> 00:11.782
Brayden's dangerous.

00:11.864 --> 00:15.464
God knows what she's getting into.
Who said anything about Brayden?

00:15.535 --> 00:18.575
She was all over him in the car park.
I'm sure it was Brayden Holt.

00:18.615 --> 00:20.175
Brayden will use Carly.

00:20.976 --> 00:23.136
How do you know he's not
using her as a drug mule?

00:23.177 --> 00:24.497
Get me a name,

00:24.537 --> 00:27.817
someone on the outside
I could use to get to Brayden.

00:27.836 --> 00:30.156
Tell your mate to call her
Uncle Morgan.

00:30.237 --> 00:33.737
What's Vinnie doing to get me out?
He wants something in return.

00:33.815 --> 00:37.735
Bea Smith. Vinnie wants her dead
and you're doing it.

01:43.101 --> 01:46.581
Holy shit! She's on the roof!

01:46.621 --> 01:49.461
What the fuck is she doing?

01:53.814 --> 01:55.434
I want to know how this could happen.

01:55.462 --> 01:57.982
She climbed the fence
and got onto the fire escape.

01:58.022 --> 02:00.042
In full view of the officers
on yard duty?

02:00.089 --> 02:02.689
I ordered her to come down
but she's too wired to stop.

02:04.329 --> 02:06.689
How are there drugs
in this prison again?

02:11.729 --> 02:15.489
Sierra Four calling Sierra Two.
I'm on the roof. Over.

02:15.529 --> 02:17.969
I want this resolved immediately
with no casualty.

02:18.009 --> 02:19.809
- Is that clear?
- Roger that.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.520
Birdsworth, be careful!
Oh shit!

02:28.480 --> 02:31.000
Let me see if I can talk her down.

02:31.040 --> 02:33.120
Liz!
She trusts me. Please!

02:33.160 --> 02:34.760
Just give us a go.

02:34.799 --> 02:36.159
Sky!

02:36.200 --> 02:37.920
Liz!

02:37.960 --> 02:40.040
Hey.
Liz!

02:40.080 --> 02:43.840
Is she trying to kill herself?
No, she's just high.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.480
I can't... I can't watch this.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.480
Look at this!

02:47.520 --> 02:49.040
What are you doing here, love?

02:51.640 --> 02:54.400
Look at all this, 'ey!

02:54.440 --> 02:57.800
They're all fluffy like
Philly cheese, 'ey?

02:59.360 --> 03:02.000
Some of your product, Franky?
You want a taste, Red?

03:02.040 --> 03:05.080
Sit with me and we can look
at the Philly cheese together.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.760
No, no. I'm out of here.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.040
Where to, love?

03:10.080 --> 03:13.440
I'm going to fly over that wall
and leave this shithole!

03:13.480 --> 03:14.800
Yeah!

03:14.840 --> 03:18.880
Jenkins, get inside now!
No, no way. I want to see the splat.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.720
Come away from the edge, Sky.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.360
If you fall,
you're gonna hurt yourself.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.400
No, not fall. Fucking FLY!

03:26.440 --> 03:27.600
NO!

03:31.471 --> 03:34.551
Sky, you silly bugger.
Are you all right?

03:36.627 --> 03:39.227
I want to know how these drugs
are getting in.

03:40.467 --> 03:42.227
I have no idea.

03:42.267 --> 03:46.347
I know you care about the welfare
of these women, Liz.

03:48.307 --> 03:51.827
You fear for them and it's made you
an excellent peer worker,

03:51.867 --> 03:53.507
but you're coming up for parole.

03:53.547 --> 03:55.547
What's gonna happen
when you're not here?

03:56.827 --> 04:00.867
Without you, Franky Doyle
is going to run riot.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.507
It won't be long
before someone else dies,

04:03.547 --> 04:06.187
just like that poor Korean girl.

04:06.227 --> 04:08.427
What was her name?

04:08.467 --> 04:10.587
Her name was Su Yung.

04:11.587 --> 04:13.947
Hmm, Su Yung.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.786
You can prevent that, Liz.

04:21.827 --> 04:23.587
Talk to me.

04:41.307 --> 04:44.827
She's not talking. Organise a ramp.
I want these drugs found.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.827
Birdsworth.

04:46.867 --> 04:48.627
Governor.

04:52.467 --> 04:53.947
Is she OK?

04:53.987 --> 04:56.147
She's in Medical, coming down.

05:02.827 --> 05:05.827
I don't want a serve.
I'm gonna give you one.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.587
You talk about these woman
being family,

05:09.627 --> 05:11.867
then you pump them
full of crap gear.

05:11.907 --> 05:15.627
I didn't know that gear was crap and
I don't force them to use the shit.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.667
Oh, Franky, mate.

05:17.707 --> 05:20.987
That's a fucking cop-out
and you know it is.

05:22.747 --> 05:24.787
It HAS to stop!

05:24.827 --> 05:27.587
We've just had Sky
on the freaking roof.

05:28.587 --> 05:31.267
How would you feel if she'd jumped?

05:31.307 --> 05:33.827
A lockdown is in force.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.427
All prisoners must
return to their units.

05:36.467 --> 05:38.387
They're doing a ramp!

05:52.147 --> 05:54.427
Be ruthless. I want results.

06:12.907 --> 06:16.907
The total yield was a few small
amounts of various substances.

06:16.947 --> 06:19.067
Personal use amounts?
Yes.

06:19.107 --> 06:23.347
No-one is talking about the source?
I'm afraid not, Governor.

06:23.387 --> 06:25.827
Someone's bringing in
those drugs for Doyle.

06:25.867 --> 06:28.907
She's too smart to do it herself.
I'm gonna find out who it is.

06:30.347 --> 06:33.067
Come here, Vera.
Yes, Governor.

06:36.307 --> 06:38.067
This is a visitors log.

06:38.107 --> 06:41.707
Last week... and today.

06:41.747 --> 06:44.307
Anything stand out to you?

06:46.147 --> 06:49.347
Simone Slater's husband is visiting
for the third time in two weeks.

06:49.387 --> 06:51.707
That's unusual.
More than unusual.

06:51.747 --> 06:53.547
Right.

06:53.587 --> 06:57.347
I want you to monitor that visit.
Keep a close eye on them.

06:57.387 --> 06:58.707
Yes, Governor.

07:10.387 --> 07:13.027
That gear you gave me
last week was shit.

07:13.067 --> 07:15.507
It had a bad effect
on one of the women.

07:15.547 --> 07:17.427
Someone put the chocolates
in the fridge

07:17.467 --> 07:20.947
and the stick mags are out of date,
think we're running a supermarket?

07:20.987 --> 07:24.147
Listen, arsehole. I've got
a responsibility to those women.

07:24.187 --> 07:27.067
They trust me to bring in decent gear
that's not gonna fuck 'em up.

07:27.107 --> 07:30.227
Oh, a little firecracker,
aren't you, 'ey?

07:30.267 --> 07:33.467
You'd go off like a frog in a sock.
Not that you'll ever know.

07:33.507 --> 07:38.107
Don't be like that now, baby, 'ey.
I promise I'll do better next time.

07:38.147 --> 07:40.907
You'd better, otherwise
the arrangement's over.

07:40.947 --> 07:42.867
I'll erm...

07:42.907 --> 07:45.387
I'll get you some Pink Dragon.

07:45.427 --> 07:46.747
Pink Dragon?

07:46.787 --> 07:51.267
Yeah, it's real pure. Potent as.
Satisfaction guaranteed, babe.

07:51.307 --> 07:52.827
Guaranteed?
Yeah.

07:52.867 --> 07:55.467
You'll be an absolute
fucking legend.

07:55.507 --> 07:57.067
It'll cost you a buck.

07:58.587 --> 08:01.667
Doyle, no fraternisation
with the male prisoners.

08:01.707 --> 08:03.307
Ergh!

08:03.347 --> 08:05.827
Don't make me gag, Miss Miles.

08:06.867 --> 08:08.547
Get back to work.

08:24.307 --> 08:27.147
Hey, you got a visit?
Yeah.

08:28.587 --> 08:31.627
You're gonna get me that number?
Spitz said he'd look into it.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.467
He's gonna give it to you today?

08:33.506 --> 08:34.986
Smith, get back to work!

08:35.027 --> 08:36.386
Get me that number!

08:38.067 --> 08:42.147
What's the fucking hold-up?
Just get it done.

08:42.187 --> 08:46.027
I do her and walk around with
a massive fucking target on my head!

08:46.067 --> 08:48.427
You know what it'll mean
if I get caught.

08:48.467 --> 08:51.267
Fifteen to 20 years in here.
I can't hack that.

08:51.307 --> 08:54.227
Find a way to do it
so no-one can pin it on you.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.947
It's not that easy!

08:58.627 --> 09:02.827
I'm not a murderer and Bea Smith
is my only ally in here.

09:04.827 --> 09:08.467
You know what's Vinnie's like.
Remember Cat's brother?

09:08.507 --> 09:11.987
That could be me or Carly.
Not if you take him out instead.

09:12.027 --> 09:13.627
Don't make a joke of it.

09:13.667 --> 09:16.627
I don't mean you but what about
that bloke, the name you gave me?

09:16.667 --> 09:19.227
Call him. He'll take care of it.

09:19.267 --> 09:22.187
It's too risky. Where will we get
the money from anyway?

09:25.267 --> 09:27.267
Listen...

09:30.547 --> 09:32.907
You've got to do this.

09:32.947 --> 09:36.387
You have to do this
or I'm a dead man.

09:53.987 --> 09:56.067
What did he pass you?
Nothing.

09:56.107 --> 09:59.347
You might as well give it up.
I'm gonna find it anyway.

09:59.387 --> 10:02.427
Is this how you get your kicks?
How pathetic!

10:02.467 --> 10:05.667
Fine, have it your way. Kit off.

10:07.867 --> 10:09.987
Nothing?
Nothing.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.107
Hmm.

10:12.147 --> 10:14.827
What was your impression
from the conversation?

10:14.867 --> 10:18.307
He seemed to be pressuring her
and she mentioned Bea Smith.

10:18.347 --> 10:19.467
Bea Smith.

10:19.507 --> 10:22.107
Wouldn't be the first time
Smith has brought in drugs.

10:22.147 --> 10:25.827
She wouldn't be a pushover now
after what happened to her daughter.

10:25.867 --> 10:27.067
True.

10:27.107 --> 10:29.667
Keep an eye on Slater.
She's up to something.

10:29.707 --> 10:31.267
Yes, Governor.

10:34.627 --> 10:38.187
Miss Miles?
Can I show Doreen the plants?

10:38.227 --> 10:40.027
Yeah.
Thank you.

10:41.467 --> 10:44.147
How you going?
Good.

10:45.387 --> 10:48.467
I really, really want you.

10:48.507 --> 10:50.147
Good.

10:53.307 --> 10:55.627
Hey, listen, babe,

10:55.667 --> 10:59.667
the gear Bates is gonna give Franky
is not all it's cracked up to be.

10:59.707 --> 11:01.267
What do you mean?

11:01.307 --> 11:04.267
A couple of guys OD'd
the other day from it.

11:04.307 --> 11:06.307
What?!
You all right?

11:06.347 --> 11:10.507
He's calling it Pink Dragon like
it's something real great but...

11:10.547 --> 11:13.267
Ladies, that's it for today.
Pack up. Back to your units.

11:13.307 --> 11:15.427
Come on, fellows.
That's it. Pack it up.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.707
Bye-bye.
See ya.

11:27.267 --> 11:29.587
What do you expect me
to do about it?

11:29.627 --> 11:31.627
How about giving Franky a heads up?

11:31.667 --> 11:34.547
She wouldn't piss on me
if I was on fire at the moment.

11:34.587 --> 11:36.627
It has to stop.
Yeah, but how?

11:36.667 --> 11:40.147
I don't know but I'm not gonna
sit on my arse and watch someone OD.

11:40.187 --> 11:43.147
You're not gonna lag are you?
No! No, of course not.

11:43.187 --> 11:45.307
Don't start a shit storm.
Just promise me...

11:45.347 --> 11:46.867
Promise you what, darl?

11:46.907 --> 11:49.467
Promise me you're not gonna
stuff up the garden.

11:49.507 --> 11:51.387
You mean Nash.

11:52.907 --> 11:55.067
Birdsworth?
Yeah, yeah.

12:10.827 --> 12:14.347
Hello.
Hey.

12:14.387 --> 12:16.307
So?

12:16.347 --> 12:19.387
No, it doesn't look like I'll be
getting out early after all.

12:19.427 --> 12:21.907
I've got that contact
for you though.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.347
But, I've got to set it up.

12:27.907 --> 12:29.307
OK.

12:29.347 --> 12:31.707
I just need to know
you can get the money.

12:32.507 --> 12:33.787
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

12:33.827 --> 12:36.667
You're not thinking of
ripping me off, are you?

12:36.707 --> 12:41.147
Of course not. It's just...
The guy will only deal with me.

12:41.187 --> 12:44.707
He'll need half upfront
given that the target's a hold.

12:44.747 --> 12:47.107
I told you I'm good for it.
Guaranteed?

12:47.147 --> 12:48.587
Guaranteed.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.229
Boss.

13:10.068 --> 13:13.148
Hey, Mr Jackson. How's Sky doing?

13:13.294 --> 13:16.414
She's OK. She's in the wet cells
under observation.

13:16.453 --> 13:18.213
Been there, done that.

13:18.254 --> 13:20.494
Yeah, you had the deluxe suite.

13:24.234 --> 13:25.514
What is it, Slater?

13:25.554 --> 13:27.994
I want to request my uncle
be added to my call list.

13:28.034 --> 13:31.634
I heard from my husband. He's sick
and I need to call him urgently.

13:35.114 --> 13:36.674
I'll see what I can do.

13:39.514 --> 13:41.514
How much? I've got 200 on me.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.034
250.

13:43.074 --> 13:45.554
Fuck off then.
All right, deal.

13:52.674 --> 13:54.354
What's up your arse?

13:54.394 --> 13:55.754
Nothing.

13:58.914 --> 14:01.234
If I don't do it, someone else will.

14:04.514 --> 14:07.234
I'm not hungry.
I'm gonna go back to the cell.

14:08.554 --> 14:09.754
Liz, what...?

14:11.634 --> 14:12.914
What's wrong with her?

14:20.434 --> 14:24.354
I know this is a very
difficult decision for you,

14:24.394 --> 14:27.994
but you know in your heart
it's the right one.

14:31.234 --> 14:33.354
I'm worried for the safety
of the women.

14:33.394 --> 14:36.954
That is the ONLY reason
I'm doing this.

14:40.314 --> 14:41.954
Talk to me.

14:45.674 --> 14:50.274
There's a bad stash of gear
coming in called Pink Dragon.

14:51.274 --> 14:52.674
Who's bringing it in?

14:55.274 --> 14:58.674
Is it Slater?
I don't know.

14:58.714 --> 15:02.274
How is it being smuggled?
I don't know that, either.

15:02.314 --> 15:05.354
I just got wind of it.
I heard some junkies talking.

15:05.394 --> 15:08.394
If you don't tell me how it's
coming in, I can't intercept it.

15:08.434 --> 15:09.554
Fuck!

15:09.594 --> 15:12.834
If junkies get their hands on it,
another death may result.

15:12.874 --> 15:16.354
Do you want that on your conscience?
Do you?

15:16.394 --> 15:18.714
You can't have the women's methadone

15:18.754 --> 15:21.594
and not expect this shit
to start happening!

15:27.834 --> 15:30.474
As soon as it gets here,
I'll let you know.

15:31.874 --> 15:34.434
That is the best I can do.

15:41.154 --> 15:42.834
Very well.

15:47.914 --> 15:50.994
It feels better, doesn't it?

15:51.034 --> 15:52.514
Doing the right thing.

15:54.234 --> 15:56.554
I feel like Judas.

16:02.554 --> 16:05.714
It could be the number
of a drug supplier.

16:05.754 --> 16:09.154
Very good, Vera.
You can leave this with me.

16:29.594 --> 16:33.354
It's me. I have a name and number
I want you to check out.

16:48.354 --> 16:50.754
Good.

16:50.794 --> 16:53.354
Good, Joan, but remember,

16:53.394 --> 16:57.074
selecting the accurate time
to start your attack

16:57.114 --> 17:00.074
is as important as
the CHOICE of attack.

17:00.114 --> 17:03.634
Yes? DRAW their advance.

17:03.674 --> 17:06.473
Once, once you've lured them,

17:06.513 --> 17:09.434
then parry and thrust!

17:23.354 --> 17:25.914
I've got that information
you wanted.

17:25.954 --> 17:28.233
Drug dealer?

17:28.273 --> 17:30.114
Contract killer.

17:41.954 --> 17:44.754
That number won't connect.
It hasn't been approved.

17:46.594 --> 17:51.554
Oh, Slater...
So sorry to hear about your uncle.

17:52.554 --> 17:53.554
Oh...

17:56.034 --> 17:59.554
Fuck! Fuck! Argh!

17:59.594 --> 18:02.754
Mr Fletcher. I spoke to
the governor at Woodford.

18:02.794 --> 18:06.354
There's a vacancy coming up.
And you immediately thought of me?

18:26.274 --> 18:28.194
Fuck off!

18:28.234 --> 18:30.794
Get the fuck out of here!

18:33.914 --> 18:36.074
ARGH!

19:04.074 --> 19:07.594
Forget about Slater.
She's not bringing in drugs.

19:07.634 --> 19:09.074
What about the phone request?

19:09.114 --> 19:11.194
Whatever that's about,
I've shut it down.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.594
And Doyle,
do you want me to question her?

19:13.634 --> 19:16.154
Hmm?
Franky Doyle. Should I question her?

19:17.834 --> 19:20.754
No, no, no, no.
All we have to do is wait.

19:20.794 --> 19:23.954
Be patient. Be vigilant.

19:23.994 --> 19:26.434
We allow her enough rope...

19:26.474 --> 19:28.834
And we'll catch her
with this Pink Dragon?

19:28.874 --> 19:30.994
No more top dog.

19:31.034 --> 19:34.154
If you create a power vacuum,
someone else will step up.

19:35.834 --> 19:37.034
That's fine.

19:39.634 --> 19:41.194
Thank you, Vera.

20:47.354 --> 20:48.674
Simmo, what's wrong?

20:48.714 --> 20:51.194
Oh shit! Has something happened?

20:53.514 --> 20:57.194
They won't let me contact that guy.
Ferguson has blocked the number.

20:59.594 --> 21:01.634
Fucking hopeless.

21:01.674 --> 21:05.074
Carly is gonna get
sucked in by the Holts,

21:05.114 --> 21:07.114
and I'm stuck in here!

21:07.154 --> 21:09.154
I'm fucked!

21:10.794 --> 21:12.914
I'm fucked.

21:12.954 --> 21:14.714
Hey...

21:14.754 --> 21:18.834
We'll work something out.
All right?

21:18.874 --> 21:22.114
Exercise period is now over.

21:22.154 --> 21:24.114
Come on.

21:27.114 --> 21:30.554
I'm telling you, I can't do it.

21:30.594 --> 21:32.954
I can't do what Vinnie wants.

21:35.474 --> 21:39.594
Listen, listen,
you can take care of yourself

21:39.634 --> 21:42.594
but you've got to make sure
that Carly is safe.

21:42.634 --> 21:47.114
I don't know, maybe, maybe tell her
to stay overseas or something.

21:49.074 --> 21:52.314
You're asking me to do something
you can't do.

21:56.194 --> 21:57.834
I'm sorry.

22:03.274 --> 22:07.514
Listen, listen,
you can take care of yourself

22:07.554 --> 22:09.914
but you've got to make sure
Carly is safe.

22:09.954 --> 22:14.194
I don't know, maybe, maybe tell her
to stay overseas or something.

22:14.234 --> 22:16.794
For crying out loud,
you stupid bitch!

22:16.834 --> 22:18.434
You have to do Bea Smith!

22:18.474 --> 22:20.234
What do you think
is gonna happen to me?

22:20.274 --> 22:22.314
You've got to do it!

22:26.879 --> 22:30.439
- Will you miss me?
- I will for sure.

22:30.479 --> 22:33.239
It's very quiet
around the house.

22:34.371 --> 22:36.511
Are you serious?
What are you doing here?

22:36.563 --> 22:38.403
I need to see Franky.
Yeah?

22:38.550 --> 22:41.630
Maybe she doesn't want to see you
because we don't like slags here.

22:41.670 --> 22:43.430
Shut up, you stupid bitch.
You shut up!

22:43.470 --> 22:45.950
Do you wanna go?
Hey, shut the fuck up!

22:45.990 --> 22:50.230
What do you want?
Now you've interrupted my study.

22:51.110 --> 22:52.350
A hit.

22:54.815 --> 22:56.655
Junkies never change, do they?

22:58.055 --> 23:02.095
And you're coming to me.
Have you got the cash on you?

23:13.535 --> 23:15.255
Booms. Go.

23:15.295 --> 23:17.375
I need a fuete, too.

23:26.695 --> 23:28.655
Have fun, Simmo.

24:04.095 --> 24:07.655
Hey. I just came to see
if you were...

24:11.095 --> 24:13.055
Oh shit!

24:13.095 --> 24:14.575
Simmo?

24:14.615 --> 24:17.415
Hey! Can you hear me?

24:17.455 --> 24:19.615
Hey, Simmo! Wake up.

24:19.655 --> 24:21.695
Come on, open your eyes!

24:21.735 --> 24:22.975
We need help here!

24:23.015 --> 24:25.575
Simmo, shit!
Somebody help!

24:25.615 --> 24:27.375
Hey, Simmo! Simmo!

24:27.415 --> 24:29.935
Look at me, wake up.
Can you hear me?

24:37.055 --> 24:39.775
It's Slater.
She OD'd but she's gonna be OK.

24:39.815 --> 24:41.735
Smith found her
and raised the alarm.

24:42.455 --> 24:44.735
I see. How ironic.

24:44.775 --> 24:47.895
When the nurse has her stabilised,
cuff her to the bed.

24:47.935 --> 24:51.295
She can spend the night in Infirmary.
You think handcuffs are necessary?

24:51.335 --> 24:54.455
If she suicidal we don't want her
trying it again, do we?

24:54.495 --> 24:55.895
Yes, of course.

24:55.935 --> 24:59.295
Keep her under constant observation.
Yes, Governor.

24:59.335 --> 25:01.815
Actually erm...

25:01.855 --> 25:04.895
I have to get some other officers
to take care of Slater.

25:04.935 --> 25:06.535
Why is that?

25:06.575 --> 25:09.855
My mother's on stronger pain
medication but it's not working.

25:09.895 --> 25:12.735
I know I assured you I wouldn't
let issues at home...

25:12.775 --> 25:16.575
Vera, enough. I understand.

25:16.615 --> 25:18.575
Go home to your mum.

25:19.695 --> 25:22.215
Is just, she's extremely erm...

25:22.255 --> 25:24.455
She has a strong personality.

25:26.455 --> 25:28.055
Thank you.

25:28.095 --> 25:29.935
Vera!

25:33.935 --> 25:36.535
Mum, I've called palliative care.

25:36.575 --> 25:38.935
It's two hours till I can
give you another shot.

25:38.975 --> 25:40.335
I can't wait!

25:40.375 --> 25:43.055
I know. OK.

25:47.815 --> 25:51.895
I can give you a slow-release
OxyContin to tide you over.

25:51.935 --> 25:55.055
Well, just get on with it!
OK!

25:57.255 --> 25:59.135
OK, come on.

25:59.175 --> 26:00.735
Come on.

26:03.855 --> 26:05.495
OK, here you go.

26:06.495 --> 26:09.095
That's it. Good.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.575
OK.

26:10.615 --> 26:13.735
Mum! Mum, you have to swallow it!

26:15.095 --> 26:17.695
Spit it out, spit! Spit!

26:17.735 --> 26:19.455
Oh, God!

26:21.575 --> 26:24.215
Oh, it's all right. It's OK.

26:37.895 --> 26:41.455
I know you've got your hands full.
I've just brought you some food.

26:42.535 --> 26:43.975
Oh I'm...

26:45.375 --> 26:47.095
Thank you.

26:49.215 --> 26:51.775
I'm just in the middle of something.
Yeah.

26:51.815 --> 26:54.855
Would you like to come in?
No, I don't want to interrupt.

26:54.895 --> 26:56.375
VERA!

26:56.415 --> 26:58.935
I have to go.
Sorry, I have to see to her.

26:58.975 --> 27:00.575
VERA!

27:07.655 --> 27:10.255
Mum, you're fine.

27:12.375 --> 27:13.655
Who's that?

27:16.215 --> 27:20.455
Erm, Mum, this is my boss,
Governor Ferguson.

27:20.495 --> 27:23.975
Hello. I'm very pleased to meet you,
Mrs Bennett.

27:24.015 --> 27:25.935
Vera has told me so much about you.

27:25.975 --> 27:29.615
Miss Ferguson has kindly
brought us some dinner.

27:29.655 --> 27:32.815
It'll be a damn sight better
than what you've been feeding me.

27:32.855 --> 27:36.095
I have to puree her food.
She has difficulty swallowing.

27:36.135 --> 27:38.735
I have difficulty swallowing
the muck she gives me.

27:43.855 --> 27:47.375
I'm sure Vera is doing
her very best, Rita.

27:48.415 --> 27:50.935
She tries, but she can't cut it.

27:50.975 --> 27:54.015
It's the story of her life.

27:54.055 --> 27:57.775
She's like this at work too,
I'll bet, huh?

28:00.575 --> 28:03.575
Mum, I think that's enough for now,
don't you?

28:06.815 --> 28:10.055
I need something for the pain!

28:10.095 --> 28:12.015
I'll get you something.

28:14.135 --> 28:16.375
Why don't you do what you need to do?

28:16.415 --> 28:18.935
I'll just heat one of these up
for the two of you.

28:18.975 --> 28:20.735
I don't want to put you
to any trouble.

28:20.775 --> 28:23.935
No trouble at all, just point me
in the direction of the kitchen.

28:23.975 --> 28:25.535
That way.

28:42.855 --> 28:45.575
I'm sorry about Mum.
She's a bit delirious.

28:45.615 --> 28:47.695
Don't apologise.
All the medication.

28:51.055 --> 28:53.815
She's got quite a cocktail.
Half of them don't seem to work.

28:53.855 --> 28:56.815
These orange ones are supposed
to knock out a horse,

28:56.855 --> 28:58.295
they barely touch her.

28:58.335 --> 29:00.015
VERA!

29:01.055 --> 29:02.495
Thanks for this.

29:13.055 --> 29:15.975
She's recovered well,
physically at least.

29:16.015 --> 29:19.575
Dr Rasham thinks
it was a deliberate OD.

29:19.615 --> 29:21.815
Has he prescribed any medication?

29:21.855 --> 29:24.895
Yes, he's put her
on a course of antidepressants.

29:24.935 --> 29:28.095
That's very good.
I think she can return to her unit.

29:28.135 --> 29:29.375
It will take some time...

29:29.415 --> 29:32.335
It'll get her back into her routine.
Remove her cuffs.

29:45.815 --> 29:47.375
Hey.
Hey.

29:49.175 --> 29:51.255
Look, I've been thinking...

29:51.295 --> 29:54.695
Maybe you should give me the number
and I can sort it out, yeah?

29:54.735 --> 29:57.335
Oh, maybe you should have
let me die.

29:57.375 --> 30:00.415
Hey! That's the thanks I get?

30:00.455 --> 30:02.655
Oh...

30:02.695 --> 30:05.895
Would you just give me
the fucking number?

30:05.935 --> 30:09.295
Fuck you!
You know what? Fuck you!

30:10.495 --> 30:15.375
Fuck you! You've got to stop feeling
so sorry for yourself, Simmo.

30:15.415 --> 30:16.975
You're not special.

30:17.015 --> 30:20.055
Everyone's been through shit
in this place.

30:20.095 --> 30:21.655
You have everything to live for.

30:21.695 --> 30:25.335
You have a beautiful daughter and
loving husband still there for you.

30:25.375 --> 30:27.375
Nothing is more important than that.

30:27.415 --> 30:29.015
Settle down, Smith.

30:29.055 --> 30:31.855
You need to find the guts to do
what you have to to survive,

30:31.895 --> 30:34.655
like every single one of
these women has had to do.

30:35.575 --> 30:37.335
You hear me?

30:37.375 --> 30:39.975
You need to sort your shit, Simmo.

30:40.015 --> 30:41.975
Fucking toughen up!

30:43.215 --> 30:44.735
That's enough, ladies!

30:49.335 --> 30:50.695
Settle down, ladies!

30:57.495 --> 31:00.495
Calm down, please!

31:04.375 --> 31:06.215
Calm down!

31:17.206 --> 31:21.126
You gave Simmo serve this morning.
Is everything OK?

31:21.166 --> 31:22.606
Yeah.
Yeah?

31:28.166 --> 31:29.686
Hey.

31:31.246 --> 31:34.506
Mr Faulkner, can I just show Dor?

31:34.548 --> 31:36.148
Yeah, go on.
Thank you, sir.

31:36.188 --> 31:37.508
Hey, Dor.

31:37.548 --> 31:39.468
Oh, what's happened?
No, he's OK.

31:39.508 --> 31:43.068
He just got out of his box and
fell right on his arse, didn't you?

31:43.108 --> 31:46.028
I think he was trying to fly.
Really?

31:46.068 --> 31:47.148
Hello!

31:47.188 --> 31:49.588
Want to see?
Yeah, go on.

31:49.628 --> 31:52.428
All right.
Give him a go. See how he goes.

31:52.468 --> 31:55.108
Here you go.
He's so cute!

31:55.148 --> 31:56.428
Isn't he?

31:56.468 --> 31:59.668
Maybe if I chuck him off the roof,
he'll fly.

31:59.708 --> 32:02.068
Boom!
What? He's a bird!

32:02.108 --> 32:05.308
It's what they do.
Not yet! He's a baby.

32:05.348 --> 32:07.668
Is he gonna fly?

32:07.708 --> 32:09.468
Atta boy.
He's thirsty.

32:15.828 --> 32:17.388
What's the fucking problem?

32:17.428 --> 32:19.828
Right, I've got chocolate.

32:21.268 --> 32:25.028
Booze. Ciggies. Weed and...

32:26.588 --> 32:28.708
Ta-da.

32:28.748 --> 32:30.348
Pink Dragon.

32:35.548 --> 32:37.228
Oh, look at you!

32:37.268 --> 32:39.388
Cute, isn't he?

32:41.508 --> 32:43.628
It's all good.
I'll send Boom in.

32:43.668 --> 32:45.508
Oh yeah...

32:45.548 --> 32:49.068
I don't want another Boomer blow.
Fine, suit yourself.

32:49.108 --> 32:52.468
I told you the Pink Dragon
was gonna cost you, baby.

32:55.108 --> 32:57.028
Fuck off!

33:06.108 --> 33:09.228
You're not going to squeal,
are you, baby, hey?

33:09.268 --> 33:12.468
Not with all that lovely green
at stake, 'ey?

33:15.548 --> 33:17.908
I know you're not gonna squeal.

33:22.191 --> 33:26.991
Sierra Six to Sierra Three.
We need help, repeat, we need help.

33:28.466 --> 33:31.986
How is this fair?
I'm the victim here.

33:32.026 --> 33:34.266
Bates is on his way to the hospital.

33:34.331 --> 33:36.971
That fork punctured his scrotum.

33:37.011 --> 33:40.171
Yeah, good. He was asking for it.

33:40.211 --> 33:42.291
Yeah, good move, Franky.

33:45.011 --> 33:47.771
All right, ladies. Let's go.

33:51.251 --> 33:54.091
Let's get Jenkins out of there.
Let's move.

33:54.131 --> 33:55.161
Yes, sir.

33:55.163 --> 33:57.163
All you clowns, listen up.

33:57.388 --> 33:59.788
Gather up all your tools
and personal belongings.

34:00.033 --> 34:02.793
Don't leave anything because
you won't be coming back.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.993
Nash! Nash, over here.

34:05.034 --> 34:07.954
What are you think you're doing?
Taylor, are you deaf?

34:08.100 --> 34:10.659
I said haul your arse out of here.
Let's go.

34:12.020 --> 34:14.739
Please, Mr Fletcher.
Can you let me in?

34:14.780 --> 34:18.780
This area is now off-limits.
Please, it's just for a second.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.139
Are you two trying
to get me suspended?

34:23.179 --> 34:25.340
No, no, no.
We just want to say goodbye.

34:25.380 --> 34:26.739
Please, sir?

34:28.380 --> 34:32.980
It's tough, OK, but you've got to
let it go and move on. All right?

34:33.020 --> 34:35.659
Move on, Taylor. Let's go, move.

34:47.179 --> 34:48.659
Here.

34:51.317 --> 34:53.677
Hold onto it for me, OK?
OK.

34:53.717 --> 34:56.277
Let's go. Move!

35:06.597 --> 35:09.037
Let's go. Come on.

35:14.597 --> 35:17.437
Come on. Let's go. All right.

35:19.317 --> 35:21.357
Turn around.

35:23.837 --> 35:26.357
Roll it up. Let's go.

35:35.077 --> 35:37.597
Sierra Six to Sierra Three.

35:37.637 --> 35:39.997
I need someone to help me
bag evidence.

35:40.037 --> 35:41.797
Copy that.

36:11.477 --> 36:13.797
That was a bloody cock-up,
wasn't it?

36:13.837 --> 36:16.437
Nah, or not.

36:16.477 --> 36:17.837
What?

36:21.397 --> 36:24.877
So, while everyone was freaking out
over Bates, right?

36:24.917 --> 36:27.157
Right.
I rescued all the gear.

36:27.197 --> 36:31.757
Franky is going to be so stoked
when she gets out. You want some?

36:31.797 --> 36:33.437
No.

36:33.477 --> 36:34.997
Right.

36:36.117 --> 36:37.917
Hey, Lizzie.
Yeah?

36:37.957 --> 36:42.117
From zero to hero.

36:42.157 --> 36:44.597
Ow!

38:14.397 --> 38:16.477
Have a seat.

38:21.963 --> 38:24.683
Bloody hell, Mr Fletcher.
Twice in one week.

38:24.723 --> 38:26.963
I don't know why I bother
making my bed.

38:27.003 --> 38:29.363
We found your hidey hole
in the shed, Jenkins.

38:29.403 --> 38:31.483
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:31.523 --> 38:33.923
Of course you don't. No idea.

38:36.163 --> 38:40.803
Oh, lookie, lookie here. Huh?
It sounds like Christmas.

38:43.443 --> 38:45.683
What have you got here?
Nothing.

38:45.723 --> 38:47.763
Nothing?
No, it's not mine.

38:47.803 --> 38:49.443
Not yours?
No.

38:49.483 --> 38:50.843
We'll see about that.

39:06.923 --> 39:08.923
You idiot.

39:08.963 --> 39:11.003
Move. Move!

39:32.563 --> 39:35.803
It's nice of you to visit.
Are you missing me?

39:37.083 --> 39:38.243
No.

39:39.483 --> 39:40.963
It was self defence.

39:41.003 --> 39:43.483
I don't doubt you had
reasonable grounds.

39:43.523 --> 39:46.923
You're entitled to an acquittal
if the police press charges.

39:46.963 --> 39:48.483
So, why am I here?

39:48.523 --> 39:52.443
Well, here's the thing,
and it's bad news I'm afraid.

39:52.483 --> 39:56.763
Miss Bennett discovered
your drop box in the garden shed.

39:56.803 --> 39:58.283
It's a clever arrangement.

39:58.323 --> 40:01.923
Why is it MY drop box when the whole
prison had access to that shed?

40:01.963 --> 40:05.123
You're the only one with the smarts
to come up with something like that.

40:05.163 --> 40:07.723
Thank you for the compliment
but I know nothing about it.

40:07.763 --> 40:09.523
That's strange,

40:09.563 --> 40:13.483
because a stash of heroin was just
found in your little helper's cell.

40:13.523 --> 40:16.643
Get your big paws off me.
I can walk!

40:16.683 --> 40:20.363
She'll be up for at least
another seven years.

40:20.403 --> 40:23.123
Possession of
a trafficable quantity.

40:25.563 --> 40:27.763
Is that how you look after
your friends?

40:40.883 --> 40:42.683
Franky.

40:42.723 --> 40:44.923
Booms.

40:44.963 --> 40:46.643
You OK?

40:48.723 --> 40:51.043
Yeah, are you good?

40:51.083 --> 40:53.283
Yeah, I'm all right.

41:05.483 --> 41:07.963
How's Slater on these meds?

41:08.003 --> 41:09.643
It's still early days,

41:09.683 --> 41:12.603
but she seems to be
turning a corner.

41:12.643 --> 41:15.603
Hmm, I noticed that, too.

41:32.723 --> 41:35.523
What was Franky doing in the shed
with that man?

41:35.563 --> 41:39.283
I heard Boomer got sprung with
a whole lot of gear. Join the dots.

41:40.203 --> 41:42.803
So, she's taking
the fall for Franky?

41:42.843 --> 41:45.643
I heard Miss Miles got suspended.
Really?

41:45.683 --> 41:49.483
Which one of you bitches
stole my rubber gloves?

42:58.963 --> 43:01.403
Oh. Shit.

43:15.683 --> 43:18.403
Hey, did you put that water on...?

43:42.083 --> 43:44.283
Smith? What's going on?

43:45.563 --> 43:46.923
You all right?

44:14.563 --> 44:18.563
This is Sierra Three.
I've got a Code Black in H4.

44:20.243 --> 44:23.483
This is the same pink shit
I confiscated from H2.

44:23.523 --> 44:26.723
Well, you obviously
didn't find it all, did you?

44:43.403 --> 44:45.723
She was determined to end it, Bea.

44:45.763 --> 44:48.003
There's nothing
you could do about it.
