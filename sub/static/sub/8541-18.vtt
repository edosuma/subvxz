[instrumental music]

00:19.454 --> 00:21.064
[Teresa]
'Where have you been?'

00:21.151 --> 00:22.587
Hunting and gathering.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.589
The victim's name
is Timothy Hartley.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.200
He was killed
sometime last night.

00:26.287 --> 00:28.898
He was shot in the chest,
and then his throat was slit.

00:28.985 --> 00:31.466
His ID says, he's from about
a 100 miles away from here

00:31.553 --> 00:34.121
Hillsborough. No sign
of what he was doing up here.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.383
Sheriff says Hartley's car's
down the road.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.211
- I'll check it out.
- Alright.

00:37.298 --> 00:39.430
- You tell him?
- Tell him what?

00:39.517 --> 00:42.607
- Coroner's office sent Steiner.
- Dr. Steiner?

00:42.694 --> 00:45.610
And we all know how much you
like to make fun of Dr. Steiner.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.221
So don't, okay.

00:47.308 --> 00:48.787
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.311
No humoring yourself
at his expense.

00:50.398 --> 00:51.399
Is he that way?

00:53.140 --> 00:55.098
Top of the morning to you,
Steiner.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.622
You're looking trim.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.711
Jane.

00:59.798 --> 01:01.191
Ah.

01:02.279 --> 01:05.674
Curiously considerate killer.

01:05.761 --> 01:08.807
Slit his throat after the shots
to put him out of his misery.

01:08.894 --> 01:10.809
Three steps back, please.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.246
What?

01:12.333 --> 01:13.464
Please maintain a distance

01:13.551 --> 01:15.336
of at least three steps
from the body.

01:15.423 --> 01:16.772
Why?

01:16.859 --> 01:19.427
Because this body
is a no-Jane zone.

01:19.514 --> 01:21.733
It will not be a playground
for you.

01:21.820 --> 01:25.172
You will not touch it, or sniff
it, or place playing cards on it

01:25.259 --> 01:26.738
or borrow it
for an interrogation.

01:26.825 --> 01:30.264
If you do, a deputy
will remove you. Clear?

01:31.352 --> 01:32.744
Ah.

01:32.831 --> 01:34.964
That's a little harsh, no?

01:35.051 --> 01:37.880
You have driven me
to desperate measures.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.534
Well, I'm nothing
if I'm not respectful

01:39.621 --> 01:41.144
of my fellow crime fighters.

01:41.231 --> 01:44.495
But I can see everything
I need to from here anyway.

01:44.582 --> 01:46.410
- Really?
- Hmm.

01:46.497 --> 01:49.021
What exactly do you see?

01:49.109 --> 01:51.589
He's in money. But not a banker.

01:51.676 --> 01:55.332
Something more aggressive.
Stocks or such. Social drinker.

01:55.419 --> 01:56.725
Increased his intake lately.

01:56.812 --> 01:58.466
So, under some pressure.

01:58.553 --> 02:02.122
A registered, uh, independent,
though always votes republican

02:02.209 --> 02:05.516
and as much money as he has,
his wife has more.

02:05.603 --> 02:06.778
Ridiculous.

02:06.865 --> 02:09.085
He chose
the tasteless tasseled loafers.

02:09.172 --> 02:12.480
She bought the opal enlaced
sterling silver cuff links.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.264
Guesses.

02:14.351 --> 02:17.485
You might as well say he's going
to meet a tall, dark stranger.

02:17.572 --> 02:19.051
That's very unlikely, doctor.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.663
He's dead.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.186
And by the way, there looks like
there's something

02:23.273 --> 02:25.232
in his left front pant pocket.

02:33.631 --> 02:35.590
"You are about to think,
what the hell?

02:35.677 --> 02:38.201
How did Jane...do that?"

02:42.466 --> 02:44.076
How did you do that?

02:44.164 --> 02:45.904
Ah.

02:45.991 --> 02:49.212
"There are more things
in heaven and Earth, Horatio

02:49.299 --> 02:51.910
than dreamt of
in your philosophy."

02:55.479 --> 02:56.872
[Teresa]
'And you planned ahead.'

02:56.959 --> 02:58.961
You asked one of the sheriff
deputies to call you

02:59.048 --> 03:00.963
the next time
Steiner was on a case.

03:01.050 --> 03:03.139
And then you asked them
to plant the note.

03:03.226 --> 03:04.836
That is an absurd theory.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.925
You know this means another
apology at the coroner's office.

03:07.012 --> 03:08.362
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

03:08.449 --> 03:11.060
- Steiner loves the attention.
- Lisbon.

03:12.714 --> 03:15.107
What happened?
Where are they?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.241
[instrumental music]

03:20.548 --> 03:22.289
It was a robbery,
two guys in a pickup pulled

03:22.376 --> 03:24.204
the coroner's van over
and held it up.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.553
- What'd they steal?
- Huh, Get this.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.250
- Your vic's body.
- Hartley's corpse?

03:27.337 --> 03:29.731
That's right. Steiner tried
to stop them, believe it or not.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.820
Dr. Steiner.

03:31.907 --> 03:35.563
Agent Lisbon.
It's not as bad as it looks.

03:35.650 --> 03:38.392
Uh, go get yourself checked out
and then come talk to us.

03:38.479 --> 03:39.871
Jane, was this you?

03:39.958 --> 03:41.133
- Wh..
- Another trick?

03:41.221 --> 03:42.831
Oh.

03:42.918 --> 03:45.703
Jane had nothing to do
with this, nothing at all.

03:47.879 --> 03:49.968
- You didn't, did you?
- Of course, not.

03:50.055 --> 03:52.449
- 'Swear on your life?'
- On your life, even.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.146
Damn it.
Who steals a body?

03:54.234 --> 03:57.019
Interesting though.

03:57.106 --> 03:59.195
[theme music]

04:10.206 --> 04:12.991
The pickup was,
pulled over.

04:13.078 --> 04:15.559
There were two men, apparently
working on the engine.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.257
They flagged us down

04:17.344 --> 04:21.086
for help, we thought,
and then they pulled out guns.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.740
Can you describe them?

04:22.827 --> 04:24.960
They were both white.

04:25.047 --> 04:27.049
A little under 6 feet,
I think.

04:27.136 --> 04:28.746
I can't,
really say much more.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.793
They wore hooded..
Jackets and sunglasses.

04:31.880 --> 04:35.536
One went to the van
and dragged the body bag out.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.278
The one guarding us
went to help him, and..

04:38.365 --> 04:40.149
...that's when I..

04:40.236 --> 04:41.629
...intervened.

04:41.716 --> 04:42.891
Foolish.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.415
For once, I agree with you.

04:45.502 --> 04:48.418
They put the body into the truck
and they-they took off.

04:48.505 --> 04:51.378
- Why would anyone do this?
- We don't know yet. It's early.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.773
I have to take this. I'm sorry.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.601
Thank you for your time,
Dr. Steiner.

04:57.688 --> 05:00.256
- Of course.
- Lisbon.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.737
Ah, thanks for getting back.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.347
Goodbye again, Mr. Jane.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.088
It wasn't your fault.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.872
Excuse me?

05:07.959 --> 05:09.657
They had guns.

05:09.744 --> 05:13.443
Big, scary guns.
There's nothing you could do.

05:13.530 --> 05:17.142
The body is my responsibility.
My reason for being here.

05:17.229 --> 05:18.927
Now I have no reason
or responsibility.

05:19.014 --> 05:21.930
There's nothing for me to do,
I don't expect you to understand

05:22.017 --> 05:24.454
why that feels like failure
to me, but it does.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.369
Want a cup of tea?

05:26.456 --> 05:27.675
I don't think so.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.461
Suit yourself.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.594
I like the chapel in Yountville.

05:33.681 --> 05:36.205
It's just a long way
for the guests to go.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.860
What did you find out
about Vandermeer State Park?

05:38.947 --> 05:40.557
I lovethat place.

05:42.124 --> 05:45.388
Oh. I see.

05:45.475 --> 05:47.564
'Well, I guess
we'll just keep looking.'

05:47.651 --> 05:49.740
I love you, Craig. Bye.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.264
Vandermeer State Park.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.309
Beautiful for wedding.

05:53.396 --> 05:54.658
I've hiked there.

05:54.745 --> 05:56.356
There's an old quaker
meeting house.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.009
'Oh, it would be perfect.'

05:58.096 --> 06:00.098
But I guess
they don't allow weddings.

06:00.185 --> 06:01.926
It's too hard
on the ground vegetation.

06:02.013 --> 06:03.493
What do we have on Hartley?

06:03.580 --> 06:05.713
Jane was right.
He wasin finance.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.585
Ran a hedge fund
called the H.V. Wilder fund.

06:08.672 --> 06:11.109
But his wife's family has
the real money. Name's Cook.

06:11.196 --> 06:12.981
- The Cooks?
- Yeah, I guess.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.156
Wife's name is Peregrine.

06:14.243 --> 06:15.723
I'll deal with the family.

06:15.810 --> 06:18.247
You go and talk
to the people he worked with.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.770
Anything on the missing corpse?

06:19.857 --> 06:21.729
Forensics found
no usable prints on the van

06:21.816 --> 06:23.339
and nothing from
the tire tracks at the scene.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.472
Why steal a dead body?
What can they use it for?

06:25.559 --> 06:26.777
Got me.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.388
Go and have another talk
with the two guys

06:28.475 --> 06:29.737
that were with Steiner.

06:29.824 --> 06:32.130
Get any details
on the thieves or the truck.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.568
Van Pelt,
look for any similar crimes

06:34.655 --> 06:37.397
bodies that were stolen from
hospitals, ambulances, anything.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.094
Good luck with the Cooks.

06:39.181 --> 06:40.312
Yeah, nothing like
telling people

06:40.400 --> 06:41.749
their loved ones are dead.

06:41.836 --> 06:44.491
And oh, by the way,
we lost the corpse.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.453
None of this makes any sense.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.065
The last time I spoke to Tim

06:54.152 --> 06:57.329
he was telling me some
stupid joke he heard at work.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.636
Happy as ever.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.290
Who's responsible, agent?

07:01.377 --> 07:02.987
My son-in-law
didn't just disappear.

07:03.074 --> 07:04.859
Someone is accountable. Who?

07:04.946 --> 07:07.514
Ma'am, we don't know yet.
We're doing the best we can.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.559
- Not good enough.
- Mother.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.953
My dear, when they tell you
they're doing their very best

07:12.040 --> 07:13.345
'that's exactly
what they aren't doing.'

07:13.433 --> 07:15.043
Hell of a place
you've got here.

07:15.130 --> 07:16.740
'Where'd you get
the money for it?'

07:16.827 --> 07:18.742
- Excuse me?
- The moolah.

07:18.829 --> 07:21.353
The scratch.
The shekels. The dollarinis.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.181
What does that have to do
with anything?

07:23.268 --> 07:25.270
Obviously something
you're embarrassed about.

07:27.098 --> 07:29.536
- Sugar beets.
- Sugar beets?

07:29.623 --> 07:31.146
My, uh, my grandfather
grew them.

07:31.233 --> 07:32.800
I love sugar beets.

07:32.887 --> 07:35.803
There's no shame
in sugar beets, Elspeth.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.892
Mrs. Hartley, we found
your husband's body

07:37.979 --> 07:39.284
a 100 miles from here.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.896
Any idea what he was doing
out there?

07:41.983 --> 07:43.724
Uh, no, none at all.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.290
Was there anything
out of the ordinary

07:45.377 --> 07:47.075
going on in his life?
Troubles at work?

07:47.162 --> 07:48.598
Changes in his schedule?

07:48.685 --> 07:51.862
No, we started..

07:51.949 --> 07:55.953
...talking about
having...a family..

07:56.040 --> 07:57.955
...a while back.

08:01.176 --> 08:02.830
There, there, dear.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.832
If there are
no more questions..

08:04.919 --> 08:07.182
You didn't like
your son-in-law, did you?

08:07.269 --> 08:11.055
You found him vulgar
despite his highfalutin job.

08:11.142 --> 08:14.885
And you...you're frightened.

08:14.972 --> 08:18.280
'The body's disappearance alarms
you in a very specific way.'

08:18.367 --> 08:19.586
What is that?

08:19.673 --> 08:23.111
Harrison, please
show our visitors out.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.160
Thank you. I'm good.

08:31.946 --> 08:34.905
Oh, God.
Why do these things happen?

08:36.820 --> 08:38.561
How long have you
and Mr. Hartley been partners?

08:38.648 --> 08:41.912
Oh, uh, five years or so.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.740
We were both interested
in a fund that offered

08:43.827 --> 08:45.960
slightly esoteric
financial instruments.

08:46.047 --> 08:47.352
A hedge fund.

08:47.439 --> 08:48.789
What we do
is pretty complicated.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.094
I don't wanna bore you
with the details.

08:50.181 --> 08:51.792
As I understand it,
you rely on a strategy

08:51.879 --> 08:53.315
that exploits
mean reversion tendencies

08:53.402 --> 08:55.622
of cross currency far forward
rates. Is that right?

08:55.709 --> 08:57.580
Yes.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.364
What did Mr. Hartley
do for the fund?

08:59.451 --> 09:01.453
Built it.
Designed the strategy.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.065
Certifiable genius.
The best.

09:04.152 --> 09:07.242
A fund like yours can lose
people a lot of money.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.331
- Any angry investors?
- No, no, no.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.812
Recently, we've had
excellent returns.

09:11.899 --> 09:15.206
What about work?
Did Hartley have problems here?

09:15.293 --> 09:17.121
Loved is the word.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.950
- How about trouble at home?
- No. Tim adored Peregrine.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.778
He, he-he was a boy scout.

09:21.865 --> 09:24.215
He would never play around.
Wouldn't even think of it.

09:24.302 --> 09:27.567
He, is a straight,
straight arrow.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.438
- I see.
- The straightest.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.225
So nothing new
from the guys with Steiner

09:34.312 --> 09:37.577
but, it wasn't an entirely
wasted journey. I got scones.

09:37.664 --> 09:38.839
I found something.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.667
Three other corpses
have been stolen

09:40.754 --> 09:43.191
from vehicles leaving crime
scenes over the past six months.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.453
Huh. Who caught the cases?

09:44.540 --> 09:46.673
- We did. Rigsby.
- O'Laughlin.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.283
Why is the FBI on this?

09:48.370 --> 09:50.633
It's interstate. One of
the corpses was taken in Nevada.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.113
- You guys have a theory?
- Yeah.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.549
We think the bodies are
being sold at tissue banks.

09:53.636 --> 09:54.942
Tissue banks?

09:55.029 --> 09:56.596
They harvest bone
and tissue from the corpses

09:56.683 --> 09:58.162
then sell them
to medical supply houses.

09:58.249 --> 09:59.947
You're supposed to get
permission from the family

10:00.034 --> 10:01.905
to sell the corpse, but these
guys are skipping that part.

10:01.992 --> 10:03.603
And tissue banks are regulated.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.256
So more likely the thieves are
working with the funeral home.

10:05.343 --> 10:06.954
They provide the bodies
to tissue banks.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.738
I put together a list
of funeral homes in the area.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.349
- We can start with that.
- Great, yeah.

10:11.436 --> 10:14.396
Hey, Rigsby.
My boss asked me to come.

10:14.483 --> 10:17.268
You know, since I've worked
with CBI before.

10:17.355 --> 10:19.444
I'm not trying to get
in your face, is all I'm sayin'.

10:19.531 --> 10:20.532
Didn't think you were.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.186
- Okay, good.
- Okay.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.456
Dr. Steiner, I presume.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.808
What brings you back?

10:34.895 --> 10:36.548
Good news, actually.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.768
A small amount of blood
was recovered

10:38.855 --> 10:41.597
from the dirt under
the body at the crime scene.

10:41.684 --> 10:44.644
It contains
two distinct DNA signatures.

10:44.731 --> 10:47.037
- Killer got cut, too.
- Yes.

10:47.124 --> 10:50.084
Probably while using
a knife on the victim.

10:50.171 --> 10:51.520
There's not enough blood
for an ID

10:51.607 --> 10:53.957
but there could be
more on the corpse.

10:54.044 --> 10:56.960
Interesting. Why did you come
and tell me that in person?

10:57.047 --> 10:58.745
Instead of calling?

10:58.832 --> 11:01.835
I would like to assist in some
small way, if that's alright.

11:03.924 --> 11:06.666
Okay. Let's go get you a gun,
shall we?

11:09.538 --> 11:11.671
Kidding. Welcome. Come on.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.762
Look sharp, Lisbon.
We have a visitor.

11:19.722 --> 11:22.029
Dr. Steiner? Can I help you?

11:22.116 --> 11:23.508
Well, actually, I--

11:23.595 --> 11:25.772
Steiner's gonna be joining us
for a while.

11:25.859 --> 11:29.079
- Umm...okay.
- What is all this mess?

11:29.166 --> 11:31.821
It's Hartley's calendar
and phone records.

11:31.908 --> 11:34.128
We're making a list
of people he saw before he died.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.130
Eh. Clerical work.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.654
We need to figure out
what the big secret is.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.961
- What big secret?
- Yeah, what big secret?

11:41.048 --> 11:44.051
The big, weird secret
that the widow and the partner

11:44.138 --> 11:45.792
and everyone
won't tell us about

11:45.879 --> 11:47.532
because it's too shameful
to mention.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.273
It's funny
you should mention that.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.059
He-he did have an appointment
every week with no description.

11:52.146 --> 11:53.974
Thursdays, 2:15 to 3:30.
No name, no address.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.236
Interesting.

11:55.323 --> 11:57.281
- Clerical work, huh?
- Touche.

11:57.368 --> 12:00.981
If I may, his car's GPS
might have an address.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.069
Yes, it might.

12:02.156 --> 12:04.419
See. Useful already.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.598
2729 Hillview Avenue.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.775
This is the address
in Hartley's GPS.

12:12.862 --> 12:15.256
Okay, what's the game
with Steiner?

12:15.343 --> 12:17.475
- No game.
- What's he doing here, then?

12:17.562 --> 12:19.086
What are any of us doing here?

12:19.173 --> 12:20.740
We don't bring guests
on investigations.

12:20.827 --> 12:23.090
Maybe we should. A different
mystery sleuth for each case.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.831
- Well, if this is some gag--
- It's not.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.833
He asked if he could come along
and I said he could. Alright?

12:26.920 --> 12:30.010
That's it. We're building
bridges, mending fences.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.012
- 'Okay.'
- Planting seeds.

12:32.099 --> 12:34.057
- Uh-huh.
- Laying foundations.

12:34.144 --> 12:35.842
- Okay.
- It's a medical building.

12:35.929 --> 12:38.453
GP's, dentists,
but mostly shrinks.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.194
How do you know
who to talk to?

12:40.281 --> 12:42.370
Any calls in his phone records
to this address?

12:42.457 --> 12:44.111
[Cho]
'No, but we can check
his bank records for payments.'

12:44.198 --> 12:45.677
Uh, we'd need a warrant
for that.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.114
I'd rather just
start knockin' on doors.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.506
Then we're gonna need
more people.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.857
You'll have
to clear that with admin.

12:50.944 --> 12:53.207
[fire alarm blaring]

12:53.294 --> 12:55.209
Okay, everybody, outside!
Outside!

12:55.296 --> 12:57.646
Come on!
It's not a drill!

12:57.733 --> 12:59.779
Oh, God.
Jane, why'd you do that?

12:59.866 --> 13:01.432
Hustle it. That's the way.

13:03.695 --> 13:04.914
All of you.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.179
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.703
My name is Patrick Jane.
I'm with the CBI.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.924
We are looking for the doctor
who treated Timothy Hartley.

13:15.011 --> 13:17.622
I know you have a doctor-patient
confidentiality thing.

13:17.709 --> 13:20.625
Let's not
worry about that right now.

13:20.712 --> 13:24.368
Would Timothy Hartley's doctor,
please raise his or her hand?

13:24.455 --> 13:27.676
Raise it on up.

13:27.763 --> 13:30.331
'I know it's one of you.
maybe to your right'

13:30.418 --> 13:34.378
maybe to your left. Up, up, up,
up with your hand. Bring it up.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.380
Okay, so no one has raised
their hand.

13:36.467 --> 13:40.558
That doesn't matter
because I know that, you, ma'am

13:40.645 --> 13:43.257
are the person who we seek.
Please come forward.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.825
Everyone else, thank you,
and back to your quackery.

13:47.957 --> 13:50.003
What's your name, ma'am?

13:50.090 --> 13:52.309
Dr. Wendelyne Mccormick.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.659
And I won't discuss my patients.

13:54.746 --> 13:56.618
Or the fact that
someone is my patient.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.881
We're investigating the murder
of Timothy Hartley.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.188
He was killed last night.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.146
Oh, God.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.845
Um...alright.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.065
How did you know it was me?

14:09.152 --> 14:11.459
Everyone else was looking around
to see who it was

14:11.546 --> 14:13.069
but you weren't,
because you knew.

14:13.156 --> 14:15.376
[horn blares]

14:15.463 --> 14:19.510
Great. The fire department.
I'll go talk to 'em.

14:19.597 --> 14:22.209
Tim had been in therapy
for about four months.

14:22.296 --> 14:23.732
He'd had
a traumatizing experience

14:23.819 --> 14:25.255
that he wanted to work through.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.605
What kind of an experience?

14:27.692 --> 14:31.000
Agent, can I get some assurance
of discretion from you?

14:31.087 --> 14:33.698
It's a sensitive matter
to the people around him.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.787
We can't promise anything.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.528
Very well.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.443
About five months ago

14:39.530 --> 14:41.402
he had an abduction experience.

14:41.489 --> 14:43.230
Excuse me?

14:43.317 --> 14:46.581
He believed he was abducted
by extraterrestrial beings..

14:49.236 --> 14:53.457
...taken to their ship,
examined...and released.

14:53.544 --> 14:55.503
Hmm.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.419
Kidnapped by aliens.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.117
Cool.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.255
I was being lifted
by the light, up and away.

15:08.342 --> 15:11.345
I-I couldn't...
I couldn't do anything.

15:11.432 --> 15:14.261
I was just being...
taken right to the ship.

15:14.348 --> 15:15.740
It happened
when Hartley was driving home

15:15.827 --> 15:17.568
from a trip to Reno.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.527
We found a couple of these
videos on his personal laptop.

15:19.614 --> 15:21.746
Some kind of diary of the event.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.487
And once on the ship,
there were..

15:24.967 --> 15:29.363
...there were beings
all around me...small..

15:29.450 --> 15:32.453
...small...just ash gray.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.716
And...there were
little taller ones, too.

15:34.803 --> 15:38.285
'They're the same color.
They were leaders, I think.'

15:38.372 --> 15:39.851
It just all feels so..

15:42.463 --> 15:44.595
...it feels so concrete.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.771
So real.

15:46.858 --> 15:50.036
- Crazy.
- Sounds sincere to me.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.776
Sincerely cuckoo.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.517
I don't see any sign
he's lying.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.345
It could be a dream
that he experienced

15:55.432 --> 15:57.826
during a hypnagogic state,
that would make it true for him

15:57.913 --> 15:59.088
but not objectively real.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.003
Exactly.
I agree with him completely.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.744
Thousands of people say
it's happened to them.

16:02.831 --> 16:05.399
They can't all be crazy
or lying.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.879
I'm just saying you should
keep an open mind.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.359
You can't prove
there aren't aliens.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.100
That's true.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.973
Okay, th-the point is, the wife
had to have known about this.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.844
- We need to talk to her again.
- Yeah.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.411
Where are we with the body hunt?

16:17.498 --> 16:19.369
We've identified
eight funeral parlors

16:19.456 --> 16:21.154
'that had extensive
legitimate dealings'

16:21.241 --> 16:22.938
with tissue banks.
We're gonna start with them.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.635
We're splitting the interviews
with O'Laughlin.

16:24.722 --> 16:27.508
Alright, let me know
what you find.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.466
Watch the skies, Grace.

16:31.816 --> 16:34.863
Tim told me
as soon as it happened.

16:34.950 --> 16:38.258
He said he met them
in a field outside Auburn.

16:38.345 --> 16:41.696
- Where we found his body?
- Mm-hmm.

16:41.783 --> 16:44.351
He kept going back.
He couldn't tell me why.

16:44.438 --> 16:47.267
I mean, he knew
it wasn't rational.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.269
Why didn't you tell us this
before?

16:49.356 --> 16:52.315
I got a call from Art Vella

16:52.402 --> 16:54.361
Tim's partner.

16:54.448 --> 16:57.277
He told me not to mention it,
begged me.

16:57.364 --> 17:00.280
He said it would be devastating
for the business.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.456
You believed your husband's
story, didn't you?

17:02.543 --> 17:05.285
That's why you were so scared
when the body disappeared.

17:05.372 --> 17:08.244
- You felt the aliens took him.
- Okay, okay.

17:08.331 --> 17:10.768
Listen to me.

17:10.855 --> 17:13.380
My husband wasn't crazy.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.643
Okay?

17:15.730 --> 17:18.254
He wouldn't lie to me
about something like that.

17:18.341 --> 17:21.649
Rubbish, when someone tells you
something contrary to fact

17:21.736 --> 17:23.564
they are lying, full stop.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.653
Don't start, mother.

17:25.740 --> 17:29.700
Agents, my son-in-law was
drunk, or drug-addled, or both.

17:29.787 --> 17:32.616
As for this tabloid trash
about Men from Mars.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.401
- Ladies.
- How can you say that?

17:34.488 --> 17:36.620
- Ridiculous. Just ridiculous!
- This is so like you, mother.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.448
I've never heard
such twaddle in my life..

17:38.535 --> 17:40.059
And he said it
with a straight face.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.234
You honestly think..

17:41.321 --> 17:43.714
Ladies. Ladies, that's enough.

17:43.801 --> 17:46.543
Wait. What are
you looking for?

17:46.630 --> 17:48.241
Ah, yes.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.723
You're a scotch man, right?

17:52.810 --> 17:56.162
Uh...uh, yes, I..

18:05.171 --> 18:07.216
Oh, no, no. I-I shouldn't.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.132
You really should.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.526
Hmm.

18:12.613 --> 18:14.354
Cheers.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.054
[sighs]

18:20.795 --> 18:22.753
You know, don't you?

18:22.840 --> 18:24.059
Excuse me?

18:24.146 --> 18:26.670
You know that I'm sick.

18:26.757 --> 18:29.499
Why would Patrick Jane,
of all people

18:29.586 --> 18:31.458
invite me to a fancy house

18:31.545 --> 18:35.201
and put a first-rate scotch
in my hand if he didn't know?

18:35.288 --> 18:37.768
You've lost some weight.
Eight pounds.

18:37.855 --> 18:40.075
Yes.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.555
Your face is looking drawn.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.557
You're taking
some powerful medication.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.776
I can see it in the pallor
of your skin.

18:45.863 --> 18:46.908
Yes.

18:49.084 --> 18:50.390
I'm dying.

18:51.304 --> 18:53.088
I have a month..

18:53.175 --> 18:55.046
...most likely, maybe less.

18:58.702 --> 19:00.095
I'm sorry.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.492
Ah.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.583
Thank you for the distraction.

19:11.889 --> 19:16.329
Well, it's always good
to...keep busy.

19:16.416 --> 19:20.376
There's probably some, uh,
Havana cigars in that box there.

19:20.463 --> 19:23.553
No. No, no.
I...I couldn't.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.556
Could I?

19:28.558 --> 19:30.865
[Steiner]
'Well, you're right.'

19:33.084 --> 19:34.825
This is a good cigar.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.089
Hmm.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.009
The only other time

19:45.096 --> 19:47.534
that I have been
in a room like this

19:47.621 --> 19:50.667
was to examine a man
who died accidentally

19:50.754 --> 19:53.409
in the middle
of an autoerotic ritual.

19:53.496 --> 19:56.891
Well, I bet he died
with a smile on his face.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.372
[laughing]

20:02.592 --> 20:04.986
Excuse me.

20:05.073 --> 20:06.944
- Can I help you?
- Ahem.

20:08.642 --> 20:09.817
[Patrick]
'Just leaving, Harrison.'

20:15.170 --> 20:16.345
Why did you tell
Peregrine Hartley

20:16.432 --> 20:18.608
to lie to us, sir?

20:18.695 --> 20:20.741
I didn't tell her to lie.

20:20.828 --> 20:23.918
I asked Peregrine not to raise
certain irrelevant information.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.402
Why'd you do that?

20:29.489 --> 20:32.492
Tim was the brain. I handled
clients, administration.

20:32.579 --> 20:35.973
Tim was the brain.
It's all about confidence.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.541
If the investors hear about
alien probes and whatnot

20:38.628 --> 20:40.239
confidence goes
right out the window.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.284
Then I assume you asked him
not to talk about this.

20:42.371 --> 20:43.677
Constantly.

20:43.764 --> 20:44.982
But Mr. Hartley was
growing certain

20:45.069 --> 20:46.767
his experiences were real.

20:46.854 --> 20:49.204
He must've wanted
to talk about it.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.771
We had some arguments
about it.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.163
Bad arguments?

20:52.251 --> 20:53.774
I didn't kill Tim
because he wanted

20:53.861 --> 20:56.037
to go public
with his cuckoo story.

20:56.124 --> 20:59.170
You need to talk to that
UFO fruitcake that Tim met.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.607
They're friends about a week

21:00.694 --> 21:02.261
and then Tim wanted
nothing more to do with him.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.263
'I think he was trying to
squeeze some money out of Tim.'

21:04.350 --> 21:05.568
What's his name?

21:05.655 --> 21:09.224
Kirk. Can you believe that?

21:09.311 --> 21:12.401
Newsom Kirk.

21:12.488 --> 21:15.099
Is there any way
you can keep this quiet?

21:15.186 --> 21:18.538
- I doubt it.
- 2.8 billion in assets.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.236
We're going down
because my partner thought

21:21.323 --> 21:24.370
he was kidnapped
by little green men.

21:24.457 --> 21:26.154
Gray.

21:26.241 --> 21:27.590
What?

21:27.677 --> 21:30.027
The little men. They're gray.

21:30.114 --> 21:31.246
- Thanks for your time.
- Thank you.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.856
- Appreciate it.
- Bye.

21:32.943 --> 21:35.032
Two down, two to go.
Wanna grab some food?

21:35.119 --> 21:36.207
Oh, there's an errand
I wanna run.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.208
Give me half an hour.
I'll catch up.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.036
Where you going?
I'll take you.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.300
- You don't need to do that.
- Oh, come on. How far is it?

21:41.387 --> 21:43.954
It's a little ways.
It's okay. It's a wedding thing.

21:44.041 --> 21:46.305
Oh, I see.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.307
Why don't I drop you off,
I'll grab something to eat

21:48.394 --> 21:50.961
and then I stay in the car,
okay?

21:51.048 --> 21:52.485
Sure.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.636
[cell phone rings]

22:13.723 --> 22:15.551
- Hello.
- 'Hey, it's O'Laughlin.'

22:15.638 --> 22:16.944
'I tried Grace.
She didn't answer.'

22:17.031 --> 22:18.554
- She's busy.
- 'Where are you?'

22:18.641 --> 22:20.121
'I've got somethin'.'

22:20.208 --> 22:22.210
Gary Wineman, funeral director.

22:22.297 --> 22:25.605
Mentioned "tissue banks"
and he got very nervous.

22:25.692 --> 22:28.129
Mr. Wineman, these are
my colleagues from CBI.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.131
Agents Rigsby and Van Pelt.

22:30.218 --> 22:32.829
Did Agent O'Laughlin mention
what this was about, sir?

22:32.916 --> 22:36.267
Uh, some...bodies
have been stolen

22:36.355 --> 22:38.008
that might have
gone to a tissue bank?

22:38.095 --> 22:39.662
No, that's
the FBI's investigation.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.751
We're investigating a murder.

22:41.838 --> 22:44.754
Oh. You didn't say
anything about that.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.672
I certainly don't know
anything about it.

22:49.759 --> 22:51.587
Well, I hope so, sir.
A case like this.

22:51.674 --> 22:53.154
Anyone connected to it,
even remotely connected

22:53.241 --> 22:54.503
is in big trouble.

22:54.590 --> 22:56.244
Best thing
to protect yourself..

22:56.331 --> 22:59.247
...be very clear about what
you know and what you've done.

22:59.334 --> 23:01.162
Um. Oh, God.

23:01.249 --> 23:02.642
- Uh..
- Okay.

23:04.774 --> 23:08.735
W-we...my wife...
had a baby girl.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.780
And we needed
a little extra cash.

23:10.867 --> 23:14.741
So I started selling
bodies to tissue banks.

23:14.828 --> 23:19.528
And a-a-all legitimate.
I got permission every time.

23:19.615 --> 23:22.531
But the banks
always want more bodies

23:22.618 --> 23:24.185
and my wife
got pregnant again.

23:24.272 --> 23:27.406
- Look, who came to you?
- My cousin.

23:27.493 --> 23:31.714
Not a good person, he said
that if we split the fee..

23:31.801 --> 23:35.501
...he could provide bodies.
No permission necessary.

23:35.588 --> 23:37.111
All I had to do was
dummy up paperwork

23:37.198 --> 23:38.329
giving them false names.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.896
Did he bring you
a corpse today?

23:39.983 --> 23:42.595
No, no, no, no, but I-I
he has done this before

23:42.682 --> 23:45.467
with other funeral homes.
His name is Owen Melling.

23:45.554 --> 23:49.428
- I-I-I had no--
- Where is he now, sir?

23:49.515 --> 23:51.255
Melling's done time
for assault, armed robbery

23:51.342 --> 23:52.779
and truck hijacking.

23:52.866 --> 23:55.346
Did the truck jobs
with a buddy named Jim Matthews.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.175
Both are on parole. Melling owes
15 years, Matthews owes 12.

23:58.262 --> 23:59.655
And they know
if they get picked up

23:59.742 --> 24:01.875
they're violated back in.
It's good times.

24:05.269 --> 24:06.706
Owen Melling?

24:07.489 --> 24:09.273
CBI.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.537
We need to talk to you
about a robbery this morning.

24:11.624 --> 24:13.234
Just wanna get
some facts straight.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.018
Come down to the office
and we can explain.

24:15.105 --> 24:17.064
Jim! Cops.

24:19.719 --> 24:21.198
- Jim Matthews?
- Yeah. What's up?

24:21.285 --> 24:24.463
This is about
some robbery, this morning.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.682
So what? We were right here.

24:26.769 --> 24:28.554
That's right.
Been here all day.

24:28.641 --> 24:29.946
[Rigsby]
'Yeah, we still need
to talk to you.'

24:30.033 --> 24:31.644
Now, get your hands
out of your pocket.

24:31.731 --> 24:35.212
- Hands where we can see 'em.
- You heard him. Now.

24:35.299 --> 24:37.388
Don't hassle my boy!
He ain't done nothin'!

24:37.476 --> 24:39.042
Put the weapon down, ma'am.

24:39.129 --> 24:42.002
You just wanna make more trouble
for him. I won't have it.

24:42.089 --> 24:44.961
We just wanna talk to your son.
Everything's gonna be fine.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.050
Just put down the gun, ma'am.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.443
[Rigsby]
'Please.'

24:53.143 --> 24:54.188
Gun!

24:55.798 --> 24:56.930
[gunfire]

24:57.931 --> 24:59.106
Ugh!

25:18.299 --> 25:19.866
[grunting]

25:19.953 --> 25:22.651
O'Laughlin, Grace is in trouble.
Cover me.

25:27.177 --> 25:28.483
O'Laughlin!

25:30.267 --> 25:31.965
Grace, get down!

25:34.010 --> 25:36.796
[Rigsby panting]

25:36.883 --> 25:39.102
On the ground!
Facedown! Now!

25:39.189 --> 25:41.104
[Rigsby panting]

25:41.191 --> 25:42.758
Get on the ground!

25:45.152 --> 25:47.589
[dramatic music]

25:52.333 --> 25:53.421
How'd the interview
with Matthews go?

25:53.508 --> 25:55.554
Didn't. He asked for a lawyer.

25:55.641 --> 25:56.816
What'd you find
in Melling's house?

25:56.903 --> 25:58.557
No sign of Hartley's body.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.210
Forensics is checking
the pickup for DNA.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.386
I got something, according
to his cell phone records.

26:02.473 --> 26:05.346
Melling made a call yesterday
to a Wellview Funeral Home.

26:05.433 --> 26:06.695
Could be where
they dropped off Hartley's body.

26:06.782 --> 26:08.349
Get Steiner and go
and check it out.

26:08.436 --> 26:10.481
If the body's there,
he's the one to ID it.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.135
Tracked down an address
for Newsome Kirk.

26:12.222 --> 26:13.876
The guy, Hartley had
a falling-out with.

26:13.963 --> 26:15.312
He runs an organization
for abductees, called

26:15.399 --> 26:17.706
The Fourth Kind Foundation.
Office is downtown.

26:17.793 --> 26:19.752
- Does he have a sheet?
- Running it now.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.144
We'll go talk to him.

26:21.231 --> 26:22.842
- Call if anything pops.
- Okay.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.675
Newsome Kirk,
I'm Agent Lisbon.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.851
This is Agent Cho.
We're with the CBI.

26:31.938 --> 26:34.593
Well, yes.
So sad about Hartley. Welcome.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.551
Welcome.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.554
Agent Cho, you-you've,
you've been,haven't you?

26:39.641 --> 26:41.948
- Excuse me?
- Up.

26:42.035 --> 26:44.167
Taken...with them.

26:44.254 --> 26:46.387
- No.
- Well, I'm getting a..

26:46.474 --> 26:48.781
I'm getting a definite sense.

26:48.868 --> 26:50.957
It sometimes
takes a person years

26:51.044 --> 26:53.089
to realize, they've had
the experience.

26:53.176 --> 26:56.876
- Timothy Hartley.
- Of course. Sorry.

26:56.963 --> 26:58.834
You met him through
the foundation, right?

26:58.921 --> 27:01.054
Yeah. We're here
to serve abductees.

27:01.141 --> 27:05.014
Um, help them come to terms
with their experience.

27:05.101 --> 27:07.147
- Oh.
- Spread the word.

27:07.234 --> 27:09.105
Uh, Tim wanted to talk about
what he'd been going through.

27:09.192 --> 27:11.891
He asked us to keep it
in confidence, and-and we did.

27:11.978 --> 27:14.415
And that's all you did,
talk about his experience?

27:14.502 --> 27:18.201
No. As a matter of fact,
Tim had a lot of money.

27:18.288 --> 27:21.770
And frankly,
we...we need money.

27:21.857 --> 27:24.381
Well, we had-we had several
quite serious discussions

27:24.468 --> 27:27.080
about funding
this...this place.

27:27.167 --> 27:29.082
As a child..

27:29.169 --> 27:31.214
...did-did-did
you have, um, dreams

27:31.301 --> 27:33.173
where you were floating
through the house

27:33.260 --> 27:36.045
as though, pulled
by an unseen force?

27:36.132 --> 27:38.178
No.

27:38.265 --> 27:40.659
Uh, we heard
that the, uh, two of you

27:40.746 --> 27:42.573
had some sort of
a falling-out?

27:42.661 --> 27:44.445
Well, he decided that
he wanted to start

27:44.532 --> 27:47.100
his own foundation.
Er, his right, I say.

27:47.187 --> 27:49.885
- They never got angry?
- No, no.

27:49.972 --> 27:52.845
Uh, if you're looking
for someone Tim hada fight with

27:52.932 --> 27:54.585
you should talk
to that shrink of his.

27:54.673 --> 27:55.761
[cell phone vibrating]

27:55.848 --> 27:57.850
Uh, McCormick.

27:57.937 --> 27:59.852
'She wanted to write a book
about him.'

27:59.939 --> 28:02.332
He said no. She was angry.

28:02.419 --> 28:05.684
- Okay.
- Boss, from Rigsby.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.904
Uh, Mr. Newsome, is your real
name, Garrett Rosten?

28:08.991 --> 28:11.951
And did you spend a year
in Chino Prison for fraud?

28:12.038 --> 28:15.781
Because your arrest record
says you did.

28:15.868 --> 28:19.001
In my previous life,
I was Garrett Rosten, yes.

28:19.088 --> 28:21.308
And Mr. Hartley seems
like the kind of guy

28:21.395 --> 28:24.093
who would research somebody if
he was considering funding them.

28:24.180 --> 28:28.881
- Did he find out about this?
- I never hid Garrett.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.534
I'm simply
a different person now.

28:30.621 --> 28:33.146
Not that different,
there's a bench warrant out

28:33.233 --> 28:35.670
for your arrest
for kiting checks.

28:35.757 --> 28:39.543
- We're gonna take you in.
- Turn around, please.

28:39.630 --> 28:42.721
It's-it's okay.
It's...just a misunderstanding.

28:44.461 --> 28:46.899
Hey, agent,
the important thing..

28:46.986 --> 28:49.249
...is that you take
a look inside yourself.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.991
And start questioning
those experiences..

28:52.078 --> 28:53.557
...that you can't explain.

28:53.644 --> 28:55.298
Never happened.

28:55.385 --> 28:56.996
I believe you!

28:59.607 --> 29:00.826
Wake up.

29:00.913 --> 29:02.088
[groans]

29:03.829 --> 29:06.788
Newsome Kirk posted bail.
He's gonna be gone in an hour.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.573
Just in time for the 6:10
to Alpha Centauri.

29:09.660 --> 29:12.011
He was right about
Hartley's psychiatrist.

29:12.098 --> 29:14.622
She did propose a book
but she withdrew it.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.450
- 'So she had a motive.'
- Kinda.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.974
- Who do you think did it?
- "Jabba the Hutt."

29:19.061 --> 29:21.194
- Seriously.
- "Ming the Merciless."

29:21.281 --> 29:23.152
- Okay.
- ALF?

29:23.239 --> 29:25.676
When the aliens do come,
I hope they eat you.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.026
Mm.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.288
[cell phone rings]

29:30.377 --> 29:32.640
- Lisbon.
- Teresa, Brenda Shettrick.

29:32.727 --> 29:35.817
A local news crew is
about to interview Dr. Steiner

29:35.904 --> 29:38.689
about the Hartley case.
Just thought you'd like to know.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.170
He's supposed to be looking
for Hartley's body.

29:41.257 --> 29:44.217
- No, he's here.
- 'Oh, what interview?'

29:44.304 --> 29:46.436
Some background on tissue banks
and the corpse trade.

29:46.523 --> 29:48.961
There's a lot of interest.
He offered to do it.

29:49.048 --> 29:54.009
- 'You didn't know anything?'
- I'll be right there.

29:54.096 --> 29:55.794
Bye, Lisbon.

29:59.449 --> 30:02.017
The legitimate trade in tissue
is a valuable source

30:02.104 --> 30:04.672
of biological material
for medical use.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.674
Unfortunately, this
illegal trade has halted

30:06.761 --> 30:08.763
the investigation into
the death of Timothy Hartley.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.199
How's that?

30:10.286 --> 30:12.680
Well, I-I just came
from a funeral home

30:12.767 --> 30:15.030
where we had hoped
to find Mr. Hartley's body

30:15.117 --> 30:16.292
and it's-it's-it's not there.

30:16.379 --> 30:18.729
The thieves have
hidden it somewhere.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.036
'And there is crucial evidence..
Blood evidence!'

30:21.123 --> 30:24.126
On Mr. Hartley's body
that will identify the killers.

30:24.213 --> 30:26.302
- Brenda.
- If we don't find the evidence.

30:26.389 --> 30:27.869
-Now.
- Guys, that's it.

30:27.956 --> 30:29.262
Thanks very much.

30:29.349 --> 30:31.003
Did I do something wrong?

30:31.090 --> 30:32.918
We don't talk to the press
about evidence.

30:33.005 --> 30:35.355
See, it kinda tells the killer
what we're looking for.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.966
Oh. Sorry.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.012
- How did I do otherwise?
- Oh, good.

30:43.232 --> 30:45.495
- Hey, Cho.
- Yeah.

30:45.582 --> 30:49.108
I think O'Laughlin flaked
on Van Pelt yesterday.

30:49.195 --> 30:50.761
What do you mean?

30:50.849 --> 30:53.286
Well, he saw she was in trouble
and he didn't do anything.

30:53.373 --> 30:55.114
- Guess he was scared.
- It happens.

30:55.201 --> 30:58.073
- Yeah.
- Van Pelt doesn't know this?

30:58.160 --> 30:59.553
No.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.511
I don't know.

31:01.598 --> 31:03.905
The question is,
does she need to know?

31:03.992 --> 31:06.342
Yeah, it's tough.
Your call.

31:12.044 --> 31:14.046
'Dr. Steiner, I'm the coroner.'

31:14.133 --> 31:17.397
You saw the news story
on Hartley's body?

31:17.484 --> 31:20.835
Well, I lied.
I did find the body.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.098
There is evidence on it..

31:23.185 --> 31:26.188
...and it will convict you
of murder.

31:26.275 --> 31:30.018
But I haven't given the police
the body. I've kept it.

31:30.105 --> 31:31.715
And I'm willing to sell it

31:31.802 --> 31:35.589
along with my silence,
for $50,000.

31:35.676 --> 31:37.983
Because I'm a dying man.

31:38.070 --> 31:42.639
All I want, is a few days
of real comfort before I'm gone.

31:42.726 --> 31:45.338
Think about it.
You know how to reach me.

31:47.166 --> 31:48.297
[sighs]

31:49.168 --> 31:51.039
How was that?

31:51.126 --> 31:52.693
Not bad.

31:52.780 --> 31:56.740
A little over-the-top, but
you know, credible, nonetheless.

31:56.827 --> 31:58.960
Sorry.

31:59.047 --> 32:00.919
Still getting used to
all this deception.

32:01.006 --> 32:02.485
What deception?

32:02.572 --> 32:04.792
You did find Hartley's body
at a funeral home.

32:04.879 --> 32:06.968
Yes, but there was
no blood evidence on it.

32:07.055 --> 32:10.319
You can't catch a fish
without bait.

32:10.406 --> 32:13.148
We'll tell Agent Lisbon
what's going on, yes?

32:13.235 --> 32:16.847
- Oh, yeah, eventually.
- Agent Lisbon's a good person.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.023
She reminds me of..

32:19.938 --> 32:21.330
Never mind.

32:21.417 --> 32:24.812
Showtime. Huh?
Let's go.

32:24.899 --> 32:27.467
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Yes.

32:35.823 --> 32:37.259
Testing one, two.

32:37.346 --> 32:40.523
Testing two.
Testing one, two.

32:40.610 --> 32:43.135
Yes, Dr. Steiner.
We can hear you.

32:43.222 --> 32:45.789
- Just like before.
- I'm a little nervous.

32:45.876 --> 32:47.748
[Patrick]
'You're doing a great job.
You look the part.'

32:47.835 --> 32:49.228
Are you sure about this?

32:49.315 --> 32:51.839
Are you ever gonna tire
of asking me that?

32:51.926 --> 32:53.797
No.

32:53.884 --> 32:55.625
[tires screeching]

32:55.712 --> 32:57.105
Someone's coming.

33:16.168 --> 33:17.082
Go.

33:19.475 --> 33:22.696
- Dr. Steiner?
- Put your hands so I can see.

33:22.783 --> 33:24.741
- Hands in the air!
- I'm not armed.

33:24.828 --> 33:26.874
It's the butler!
The butler! It's the butler!

33:26.961 --> 33:29.137
It's the but-the butler did it!
I always wanted to say that.

33:29.224 --> 33:32.184
- But wait. It gets better.
- Let's go.

33:33.663 --> 33:35.665
Ms. Cook.
Good evening.

33:35.752 --> 33:38.364
Remember me?
I can't hear anything with this.

33:38.451 --> 33:41.497
The good doctor here, told us
that Timothy Hartley's murderer

33:41.584 --> 33:43.412
cut himself
whilst doing the killing.

33:43.499 --> 33:46.241
Yeah. Would you mind terribly
showing me your hand?

33:52.421 --> 33:54.989
Oh.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.991
You must let Harrison go.

33:57.078 --> 34:00.038
He has done nothing but serve me
faithfully and well.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.040
As I explained, ma'am,
our DA will drop

34:02.127 --> 34:04.390
the charges
against your butler..

34:04.477 --> 34:06.566
...if you answer
our questions honestly.

34:06.653 --> 34:11.223
I feel like I'm haggling in
a bazaar over the cost of a rug.

34:11.310 --> 34:15.705
But...if you will release
Harrison, then I will speak.

34:15.792 --> 34:17.533
Your son-in-law was
about to go public

34:17.620 --> 34:19.883
with the whole alien
adventure thing, wasn't he?

34:19.970 --> 34:21.668
More than that.

34:21.755 --> 34:24.671
He wanted to start a global
foundation for abductees..

34:24.758 --> 34:27.717
...to see to their needs
and promote their cause.

34:27.804 --> 34:30.807
He was gonna call it,
"The Cook Family Foundation."

34:30.894 --> 34:34.507
Well, that wasn't
going to happen.

34:34.594 --> 34:37.945
No, no, no, you cannot do this.
I won't allow it.

34:38.032 --> 34:39.686
It's not something
you can stop.

34:39.773 --> 34:42.602
Try me. I am not without
resources, young man.

34:42.689 --> 34:45.692
[Ms. Cook]  But he said he was going to use his own money for it.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.041
And then he said..

34:47.128 --> 34:49.696
Time's on my side, Elspeth.

34:49.783 --> 34:52.960
What do you mean, Timothy?

34:53.047 --> 34:55.223
Timothy, come back here!

34:55.310 --> 34:57.399
I knew what he meant,
Hartley was going to wait

34:57.486 --> 34:59.358
until I was dead,
and then use my money

34:59.445 --> 35:01.534
and my daughter
to turn the Cook name

35:01.621 --> 35:04.363
into an international joke.

35:04.450 --> 35:08.149
So the next time he went to that
place he was always visiting..

35:08.236 --> 35:09.498
...we followed.

35:10.325 --> 35:11.500
[gunshot]

35:14.721 --> 35:16.592
[flesh tearing]

35:16.679 --> 35:18.464
Why slit Hartley's throat?

35:18.551 --> 35:20.814
That was the telltale sign..

35:20.901 --> 35:24.557
...a hunter's humanity,
if you will.

35:24.644 --> 35:26.646
You learned how to hunt
and kill at a young age.

35:26.733 --> 35:29.475
Didn't you, Elspeth?

35:29.562 --> 35:32.304
Your father taught you.

35:32.391 --> 35:35.394
'Yes. He was very firm
on that point.'

35:35.481 --> 35:38.484
"Never let the animal suffer."

35:38.571 --> 35:43.358
I got awfully cross with
Consuela for mislaying this.

35:43.445 --> 35:45.491
I shall have to apologize.

35:45.578 --> 35:47.362
Mm.

35:57.198 --> 35:59.374
Hey. What's up?

35:59.461 --> 36:00.593
There's something
I have to talk to you about.

36:00.680 --> 36:01.637
What's that?

36:02.899 --> 36:04.901
Wayne?

36:04.988 --> 36:06.512
What is it?

36:12.126 --> 36:15.042
A friend of mine is a ranger
at Vandermeer State Park

36:15.129 --> 36:17.349
and maybe, I can get him
to give you a waiver

36:17.436 --> 36:19.394
to get married
at that quaker meeting house.

36:19.481 --> 36:23.355
- Really?
- Yeah. I think. I can try.

36:23.442 --> 36:26.140
Wayne, that's fantastic.

36:26.227 --> 36:27.881
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

36:27.968 --> 36:30.275
- I'm gonna call Craig.
- Yeah, okay.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.887
[knock on door]

36:41.416 --> 36:42.765
Please.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.289
Thank you for coming by.

36:44.376 --> 36:46.421
Oh, it's no problem.

36:46.508 --> 36:49.468
Nice place. Tidy.

36:49.555 --> 36:52.166
Thank you.
Please.

36:52.253 --> 36:54.821
I wanted to tell you
how much I appreciated

36:54.908 --> 36:58.303
your letting me come along
on your investigation.

36:58.390 --> 37:00.087
It was...fun.

37:00.174 --> 37:02.132
Hmm, it was fun, wasn't it?

37:02.220 --> 37:04.439
That was my pleasure.

37:04.526 --> 37:05.701
Thank you.

37:05.788 --> 37:08.443
Um, look.

37:08.530 --> 37:10.184
Won't beat around the bush.

37:11.707 --> 37:14.057
About me dying..

37:14.144 --> 37:16.756
I-I know what's
going to happen now.

37:16.843 --> 37:18.192
I've seen it.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.586
There are no mysteries.

37:20.673 --> 37:22.892
It's going to get bad..

37:22.979 --> 37:26.331
...very soon...and then worse.

37:26.418 --> 37:28.376
And I have no interest

37:28.463 --> 37:31.031
in letting nature
take its course.

37:31.118 --> 37:32.772
You understand?

37:32.859 --> 37:34.295
Uh, yes.

37:34.382 --> 37:36.819
You, uh, you want
to kill yourself.

37:36.906 --> 37:38.473
In a nutshell.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.869
I have pills,
I can take.

37:42.956 --> 37:45.698
The problem is..

37:45.785 --> 37:48.266
...if there is
an unexplained death

37:48.353 --> 37:52.095
if a body is found
in an apartment

37:52.182 --> 37:54.750
there is
an investigation, an autopsy.

37:54.837 --> 37:56.056
Mm.

37:56.143 --> 37:59.364
And the idea
of being examined

37:59.451 --> 38:01.801
of being a body
on the-on the table..

38:06.153 --> 38:10.070
But if the death is witnessed
by a Law Enforcement Officer

38:10.157 --> 38:12.290
no investigation is required.

38:14.422 --> 38:18.600
I'm not
a Law Enforcement Officer.

38:18.687 --> 38:20.080
You're close enough,
I think.

38:21.777 --> 38:24.954
I don't know that I can do it,
that I can witness that.

38:28.915 --> 38:31.613
I'm not even sure that killing
yourself is the best idea.

38:34.224 --> 38:36.226
It's what I'm going to do.

38:39.099 --> 38:40.579
Well, that's your choice.

38:42.189 --> 38:43.451
But, uh..

38:49.239 --> 38:51.633
I understand.
I..

38:51.720 --> 38:53.766
I'm sorry.

38:53.853 --> 38:56.334
This was a t-terrible
imposition.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.858
I-I shouldn't have.

38:58.945 --> 39:02.122
Please.
Forget I said anything.

39:02.209 --> 39:03.689
I'm sorry.

39:06.126 --> 39:07.780
Do you have any tea?

39:09.216 --> 39:11.174
Yes, I do.

39:11.261 --> 39:14.090
I could really use
a cup of tea.

39:14.177 --> 39:16.789
Okay.

39:16.876 --> 39:17.964
Sure.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.011
Uh..

39:22.098 --> 39:24.666
- Cookies are in the cupboard.
- Yeah.

39:24.753 --> 39:27.060
- Uh.
- Uh, would you like a cup?

39:27.147 --> 39:28.801
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

39:28.888 --> 39:32.413
Well, uh, I'm going
in the other room now.

39:34.154 --> 39:36.809
- I'll be a few minutes.
- Yeah. Take your time.

39:54.870 --> 39:57.351
[breathing heavily]

39:58.526 --> 40:00.354
Here.

40:15.761 --> 40:19.373
The note
in the dead man's...pocket..

40:19.460 --> 40:23.159
...you-you had an arrangement,
with the deputy, didn't you?

40:26.032 --> 40:27.294
Yes, I did.

40:29.731 --> 40:31.907
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

40:31.994 --> 40:34.214
It's an old,
carny magic trick.

40:36.216 --> 40:39.654
- You did magic?
- Oh, yeah.

40:39.741 --> 40:42.222
I first started out, uh,
working close-up

40:42.309 --> 40:45.138
with, uh, cards and coins.

40:46.618 --> 40:48.968
- Really?
- Yeah. I'll show you.

40:50.752 --> 40:52.406
Got a coin in here.

40:52.493 --> 40:55.104
Yeah. Okay.

40:55.191 --> 40:56.932
See that coin?

40:57.019 --> 40:58.847
It's there, right?

41:01.328 --> 41:03.025
And it's gone.

41:03.112 --> 41:04.287
It's there..

41:06.725 --> 41:09.989
'...then it's gone.'

41:10.076 --> 41:13.209
- Amazing.
- It's really quite simple.

41:13.296 --> 41:17.953
It's there...and then it's gone.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.215
Patrick..

41:22.262 --> 41:23.481
...thank you.

41:23.568 --> 41:25.961
Just watch the coin.

41:26.048 --> 41:28.181
And it's gone.

41:30.836 --> 41:32.490
It's there.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.103
'And then it's gone.'

41:40.062 --> 41:42.456
[instrumental music]
