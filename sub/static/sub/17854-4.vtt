00:00.001 --> 00:02.226
<i>Previously on "Incorporated"...</i>

00:02.228 --> 00:03.605
Told you I'd find you.

00:03.607 --> 00:04.407
Aaron?

00:04.409 --> 00:06.737
<i>There's so much riding
on this scholarship.</i>

00:06.739 --> 00:08.506
<i>You spend 17 hours
a day in that juku</i>

00:08.508 --> 00:11.976
<i>letting them pump you with
nootropics and cognitive enhancers.</i>

00:11.978 --> 00:14.145
Elena! Wake up, come on!

00:14.147 --> 00:15.747
We got the permit.
We're gonna get pregnant.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.916
Your friend's daughter, bring her tonight.

00:17.918 --> 00:18.917
I'll examine her.

00:21.922 --> 00:23.855
You lost, to him.

00:26.059 --> 00:27.825
Guess you're my ticket now, huh?

00:27.827 --> 00:29.694
That's a group of girls
being escorted to Arcadia.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.529
My sister, she's a sex slave.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.923
<i>Mr. Hendrick, right?
Human resources?</i>

00:33.925 --> 00:35.458
I hope you know what you're doing.

00:35.460 --> 00:37.227
I need to move up the ladder to get to her.

00:37.229 --> 00:38.962
<i>The Inazagi delegation's
on its way, sir.</i>

00:38.964 --> 00:41.030
<i>It's a pleasure to
meet you SVP Walters.</i>

00:41.032 --> 00:42.699
I want the basic extraction package.

00:42.701 --> 00:44.033
New name, face, fingerprints.

00:44.035 --> 00:45.768
We have a defector on our hands.

00:45.770 --> 00:48.771
We'll soon start evaluating candidates.

00:48.773 --> 00:50.440
<i>A keyhole.</i>

00:50.442 --> 00:51.407

My father just went to the bank.

02:07.385 --> 02:08.951
He'll be back soon.

02:08.953 --> 02:11.888
I actually came to see you, Elena.

02:11.890 --> 02:13.489
Rebecca Henson.

02:13.491 --> 02:14.857
I'm with Spiga Biotech...

02:14.859 --> 02:16.993
Educational Outreach Department.

02:16.995 --> 02:18.895
I'm sorry

02:18.897 --> 02:21.030
about the scholarship.

02:21.032 --> 02:22.799
The scholarship?

02:22.801 --> 02:24.167
You haven't heard?

02:24.169 --> 02:26.302
Sometimes we get the news before you.

02:26.304 --> 02:29.539
I'm afraid you didn't get it, Elena.

02:29.541 --> 02:32.542
Like I said, I'm sorry.

02:32.544 --> 02:35.511
If it means anything, you were runner-up.

02:39.850 --> 02:42.385
You came all the way
here just to tell me that?

02:42.387 --> 02:43.720
No.

02:43.722 --> 02:45.688
I came here to tell you that even though

02:45.690 --> 02:48.324
you may not realize your
dream of attending college,

02:48.326 --> 02:52.161
there could be a place for
you in the Spiga family.

02:52.163 --> 02:54.430
You are an exceptional young woman.

02:54.432 --> 02:56.566
You are young, smart,

02:56.568 --> 02:58.568
beautiful.

02:58.570 --> 03:01.537
How would you like to be a woman
of grace and sophistication?

03:01.539 --> 03:05.675
Travel the world and be among
the wealthy and powerful?

03:05.677 --> 03:07.577
I can do that for you,

03:07.579 --> 03:09.712
and I can give you enough
money to take care of

03:09.714 --> 03:12.048
your family for the rest of their lives.

03:12.050 --> 03:14.751
What do you say to that?

03:17.722 --> 03:19.689
Get away from my daughter.

03:22.226 --> 03:24.051
I was giving her an opportunity.

03:24.053 --> 03:26.421
To be a whore at one
of your executive clubs?

03:26.423 --> 03:28.456
Bet you get a nice fat bonus
for signing someone like her.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.758
Dad, stop.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.059
Listen to her.

03:32.061 --> 03:34.162
Put the gun down or he will shoot you.

03:38.234 --> 03:39.300
Okay.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.235
Everybody take a breath.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.973
The guy who runs things
around here is named Tino,

03:45.975 --> 03:47.775
and I work for him.

03:47.777 --> 03:49.177
Your guy shoots,

03:49.179 --> 03:50.778
you don't make it to the wall alive.

04:04.469 --> 04:05.468
Get out.

04:05.470 --> 04:06.803
This is the best offer

04:06.805 --> 04:08.438
someone like you's gonna get.

04:08.440 --> 04:11.607
That's why my closure rate is over 90%.

04:11.609 --> 04:13.309
Think it over.

04:37.868 --> 04:40.169
I didn't get the scholarship.

04:40.171 --> 04:42.271
That's why she was here.

04:42.273 --> 04:44.273
- Elena, I'm sorry...
- Don't.

04:44.275 --> 04:46.008
You said the scholarship was a con,

04:46.010 --> 04:47.710
and you were right.

04:47.712 --> 04:49.278
It sucks, okay?

04:49.280 --> 04:51.881
But it also means no more
seizures, no more juku.

04:51.883 --> 04:53.182
You can finally live for yourself.

04:53.184 --> 04:55.451
Live for myself? How?

04:55.453 --> 04:57.887
With the debt and the interest
piling up on this place,

04:57.889 --> 04:59.856
one bad month and we're
gonna be out on the street.

04:59.858 --> 05:02.124
- Well, what about the co-ops?
- Co-ops?

05:02.126 --> 05:04.827
It's a pipe dream, Aaron.

05:04.829 --> 05:07.663
College was our only way out.

05:07.665 --> 05:09.031
It doesn't have to be.

05:09.033 --> 05:10.533
Then you show me another way, okay?

05:10.535 --> 05:13.703
'Cause I don't see it.

05:18.408 --> 05:21.377
- Good morning.
- Mm.

05:21.379 --> 05:23.045
Ah... you hug, you kiss,

05:23.047 --> 05:25.648
and you swipe my coffee. I
fall for it every morning.

05:25.650 --> 05:27.316
Hey, I need it more than you do.

05:27.318 --> 05:29.919
We're gonna have a baby, remember?

05:29.921 --> 05:31.087
Open Design-Gro.

05:31.089 --> 05:32.688
_

05:32.690 --> 05:34.924
- That's him?
- Or her.

05:34.926 --> 05:36.893
It's up to us. Everything is.

05:36.895 --> 05:39.428
That's what today's
appointment's all about.

05:39.430 --> 05:43.766
I think I want your dimples,

05:43.768 --> 05:46.569
and your chin for sure.

05:46.571 --> 05:48.838
Eyes? Oh, maybe

05:48.840 --> 05:50.940
a combination.

05:52.776 --> 05:55.111
Hm, here you try.

06:08.625 --> 06:12.028
We're not having a clone of me.

06:12.030 --> 06:14.397
Don't you want our baby
to look like you at all?

06:14.399 --> 06:16.365
Maybe the only face I
can imagine her having

06:16.367 --> 06:18.067
is the face I fell in love with.

06:18.069 --> 06:20.469
Oh, so it is a "her" now?

06:20.471 --> 06:22.872
Or a him. Them?

06:22.874 --> 06:26.375
Wow, we do have a lot of
decisions to make, don't we?

06:28.045 --> 06:29.679
Ah.

06:32.783 --> 06:36.118
Your plan is to take birth control

06:36.120 --> 06:39.288
behind your wife's back?

06:39.290 --> 06:40.823
I don't want to hurt her.

06:40.825 --> 06:43.159
Yeah, well you're doing a hell of a job.

06:43.161 --> 06:45.094
Look, I just need you to get it for me.

06:45.096 --> 06:46.929
I can't risk it showing up
in the system under my name.

06:46.931 --> 06:49.565
What's it even gonna matter
when she hires a gestator?

06:49.567 --> 06:52.735
If my plan works, she won't.

06:52.737 --> 06:55.037
Now can you help me or not?

06:56.807 --> 07:00.276
Don't pretend I have a choice.

07:00.278 --> 07:03.813
At least when you were a
little snot, you listened to me.

07:03.815 --> 07:06.449
Yeah, well you've always
been like a father to me.

07:06.451 --> 07:09.986
You know, when things
got tough, you bailed.

07:34.177 --> 07:37.313
It's not every day the boss
is slumming down here on 35.

07:37.315 --> 07:38.714
When do you go under the knife?

07:38.716 --> 07:40.383
My Everclear presentation is tomorrow.

07:40.385 --> 07:41.651
Good luck.

07:41.653 --> 07:43.519
Not that you'll need it.

07:43.521 --> 07:46.122
There are a dozen candidates
for this promotion.

07:46.124 --> 07:47.657
We're all in the same boat.

07:47.659 --> 07:50.326
Um, that's your
mother-in-law in there,

07:50.328 --> 07:51.961
and you just pulled an Inazagi defector

07:51.963 --> 07:54.630
out of your ass. Game over.

07:54.632 --> 07:56.565
And your father's company is the lynchpin

07:56.567 --> 07:58.200
of the Spiga's supply chain.

07:58.202 --> 08:00.736
Just do me a favor, when
you finally get there,

08:00.738 --> 08:02.338
tell me what it's like.

08:02.340 --> 08:04.306
On the 40th floor?

08:04.308 --> 08:07.009
Arcadia. It's the least you can do.

08:07.011 --> 08:08.577
And after all, we've been killing ourselves

08:08.579 --> 08:09.745
to get in there.

08:09.747 --> 08:11.180
Well, I've been killing myself

08:11.182 --> 08:13.749
for a bigger house. And a pool.

08:13.751 --> 08:16.085
I know you need to tread
lightly, but come on,

08:16.087 --> 08:19.555
you want that golden
ticket as much as I do.

08:19.557 --> 08:22.992
Well, truth is, Roger, I
don't care about Arcadia.

08:22.994 --> 08:24.560
I'm meeting my wife today at the OB-GYN.

08:24.562 --> 08:26.896
- We're starting a family.
- And so is Pearson.

08:26.898 --> 08:29.031
Her gestator is eight months pregnant,

08:29.033 --> 08:30.433
but she's still in there every night

08:30.435 --> 08:32.068
sitting on some poor bastard's face.

08:32.070 --> 08:35.871
Do you know why Spiga
created the executive clubs?

08:35.873 --> 08:37.273
To stop senior execs

08:37.275 --> 08:39.174
from getting kidnapped in the Red Zones?

08:39.177 --> 08:42.510
No, to stop them from cracking
under the pressures of the job.

08:42.513 --> 08:45.114
Hell, I heard it cut suicide rates in half.

08:45.116 --> 08:47.750
Do you think you're
different from the rest of us?

08:47.752 --> 08:49.418
Excuse me.

08:49.420 --> 08:51.620
Ms. Krauss would like a
word with you, Mr. Larson.

08:53.423 --> 08:54.724
Yeah.

08:54.726 --> 08:56.692
We both have the same shot.

09:00.297 --> 09:01.964
<i>Just tell me how much
this will cost me.</i>

09:01.966 --> 09:05.101
Dad, I said I needed
your help, not your money.

09:05.103 --> 09:07.203
<i>Help is always money.</i>

09:07.205 --> 09:08.471
<i>I even have a name for it,</i>

09:08.473 --> 09:11.307
<i>"the Roger tax," remember?</i>

09:11.309 --> 09:13.743
You're never gonna let that go, are you?

09:13.745 --> 09:15.878
<i>You had to take the
wheel of that car.</i>

09:15.880 --> 09:19.715
<i>They scraped that poor
girl off the wall.</i>

09:19.717 --> 09:21.884
I need you to get me into Arcadia.

09:21.886 --> 09:23.385
<i>I have to get you laid now, too?</i>

09:23.387 --> 09:24.787
It's not that.

09:24.789 --> 09:26.622
There's someone standing in my way

09:26.624 --> 09:29.558
and I think he's connected
to one of the companions.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.060
I need to find out how.

09:31.062 --> 09:33.095
<i>Roger, this isn't your skill set.</i>

09:33.097 --> 09:35.264
<i>My advice? Forget the promotion.</i>

09:35.266 --> 09:37.066
You don't think I can cut it.

09:37.068 --> 09:39.135
<i>You're a rich kid with
poor impulse control.</i>

09:39.137 --> 09:41.604
<i>I'm not gonna live
forever. Wait it out.</i>

09:41.606 --> 09:44.473
You want to know why I chose Spiga?

09:44.475 --> 09:47.910
So that one day when you come
in to negotiate your contract

09:47.912 --> 09:49.779
the person sitting
across the table from you

09:49.781 --> 09:51.680
wasn't Elizabeth Krauss,

09:51.682 --> 09:53.315
it was me,

09:53.317 --> 09:55.484
and I rip your eyeballs out in the deal.

09:57.155 --> 09:58.587
<i>Roger,</i>

09:58.589 --> 10:00.623
<i>nothing would make me happier.</i>

10:03.294 --> 10:05.127
<i>Now, who is it you're gunning for?</i>

10:07.298 --> 10:09.932
It's better if I don't
say until I know more.

10:09.934 --> 10:12.868
- <i>Roger...</i>
- Look.

10:12.870 --> 10:15.204
You want me to stop being the fuck-up?

10:15.206 --> 10:16.772
Do this for me

10:16.774 --> 10:19.408
and I won't ask you
for anything ever again.

10:25.781 --> 10:27.822
So, Theo, folks out here are
getting paid in the currency

10:27.870 --> 10:31.189
of their employer. Dollars, Euros, Yuan.

10:31.246 --> 10:32.600
- Blackcoin?
- Yeah, so they have to

10:32.602 --> 10:34.456
turn it into cash they can spend, right?

10:34.458 --> 10:36.992
Well, where do they go? Exchange machines.

10:36.994 --> 10:38.972
You know, in goes your
blackcoins, out comes dollars.

10:38.974 --> 10:42.230
How much you get depends
on the exchange rate.

10:42.232 --> 10:43.999
See the rates change?

10:44.001 --> 10:45.534
Every now and then, there's a surge

10:45.536 --> 10:47.346
and two to one turns into 20 to one.

10:47.348 --> 10:48.940
It happens for a split second.

10:48.942 --> 10:49.992
If you're lucky enough to be at the machine

10:49.994 --> 10:54.025
at that exact moment,
you just rolled a surge.

10:54.027 --> 10:55.861
You're going to roll a surge on purpose?

10:55.863 --> 10:57.629
Not me.

10:57.631 --> 10:58.672
You.

10:58.674 --> 10:59.840
I hack the rate feed,

10:59.842 --> 11:01.074
you load the cash into the machine.

11:01.076 --> 11:03.744
That's why it's a two-man job.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.379
This isn't hacking rations though, Theo.

11:06.381 --> 11:07.781
This is the big leagues.

11:07.783 --> 11:10.016
It's graduation day.

11:10.018 --> 11:11.852
You ready?

11:11.854 --> 11:14.154
Hell yeah.

11:16.903 --> 11:18.459
_

11:23.631 --> 11:25.565
We'll come back tomorrow.

11:25.567 --> 11:27.200
The Zero Days we're exploiting,

11:27.202 --> 11:29.236
they'll patch them any
day. We have to go now.

11:29.238 --> 11:30.704
Nothing's changed, Theo,

11:30.706 --> 11:32.139
it's just a man instead of a machine.

11:32.141 --> 11:33.907
In some ways, they're even easier to fool.

11:33.909 --> 11:35.642
You look him in the eye
and you hand him the pack.

11:35.644 --> 11:36.943
That's all you have to do.

11:36.945 --> 11:38.745
Can I get a "hell yeah"?

11:38.747 --> 11:40.080
Hell yeah.

11:40.082 --> 11:41.615
On my signal. A second too soon

11:41.617 --> 11:43.049
or a second too late, we're screwed.

11:43.051 --> 11:45.085
Understood? Go get 'em.

11:49.674 --> 11:52.676
_

11:52.678 --> 11:54.110
Next.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.383
_

12:02.538 --> 12:03.657
_

12:06.357 --> 12:07.290
Thanks.

12:19.428 --> 12:20.528
Come on.

12:21.898 --> 12:24.099
Let's go, kid.

12:24.101 --> 12:25.100
Next.

12:26.352 --> 12:26.922
_

12:30.406 --> 12:33.275
Hey. Wait your turn, huh?

12:33.277 --> 12:35.777
Dollars please.

12:40.182 --> 12:41.883
2,000 Euros.

12:43.953 --> 12:46.354
That's, uh...

12:50.927 --> 12:53.561
You just roll a surge?

12:56.132 --> 12:58.199
Beginner's luck I guess.

13:01.938 --> 13:05.740
That's 20,363, including
our commission, of course.

13:09.078 --> 13:10.912
- Hold it, kid.
- Hey.

13:12.115 --> 13:13.915
- Not so fast.
- _

13:25.829 --> 13:28.263
I said step back!

13:28.265 --> 13:29.497
You!

13:36.773 --> 13:38.640
- Hey.
- Look at that face.

13:38.642 --> 13:39.941
Barely a scratch.

13:39.943 --> 13:42.177
- On the outside maybe.
- Oh, come on.

13:42.179 --> 13:44.112
You made pretty short
work of Mad Dog last night.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.513
That fight was over in what, 30 seconds?

13:45.515 --> 13:46.581
28.

13:46.583 --> 13:47.849
But hey, who's counting?

13:47.851 --> 13:49.951
Here for your purse?

13:49.953 --> 13:51.553
Yeah.

13:55.385 --> 13:57.442
Did better on the fight than I expected.

13:57.444 --> 13:59.411
And I always take care of my own.

13:59.413 --> 14:00.979
Remember that.

14:00.981 --> 14:02.414
- Thanks, Terrence.
- Mm-hmm.

14:04.617 --> 14:06.384
Got a job for you, first.

14:06.386 --> 14:08.954
I was in the cage 12 hours ago.

14:08.956 --> 14:11.790
I didn't say a fight. I said a job.

14:11.792 --> 14:13.925
There's a kid in the neighborhood, Spyder,

14:13.927 --> 14:15.627
got himself a scholarship
playing basketball

14:15.629 --> 14:17.395
over the wall.

14:17.397 --> 14:20.298
Great news for him, bad news
for the kid who came in second.

14:20.300 --> 14:23.568
That kid's family paid
me to take Spyder out.

14:23.570 --> 14:25.070
With all due respect

14:25.072 --> 14:27.806
that's a job for Semo.

14:27.808 --> 14:31.509
Really? Think you're above Semo?

14:31.511 --> 14:34.646
You're an artisan while
he's just a laborer?

14:34.648 --> 14:37.449
That hierarchical shit doesn't fly with me.

14:37.451 --> 14:40.618
I need a workforce that's nimble, flexible.

14:40.620 --> 14:44.089
Let me be perfectly clear.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.658
You are what I say you are.

14:46.660 --> 14:48.793
If I want a leg broken,

14:48.795 --> 14:50.829
you're a leg-breaker.

14:50.831 --> 14:52.464
You hear me?

14:56.169 --> 14:58.703
You want your purse or not?

15:19.493 --> 15:20.792
I thought it over.

15:20.794 --> 15:22.660
I can't get you into Arcadia.

15:22.662 --> 15:25.497
What I can do is arrange for
an out-call with the girl.

15:25.499 --> 15:27.032
But I'm gonna have to call in

15:27.034 --> 15:29.501
every marker that I have to do it.

15:29.503 --> 15:31.803
You want something in return?

15:31.805 --> 15:34.139
That's how it works.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.307
- What is it?
- Your brother.

15:36.309 --> 15:37.976
I need you to convince him to move out,

15:37.978 --> 15:39.210
get the help he needs.

15:39.212 --> 15:41.146
The help he needs because of you.

15:41.148 --> 15:43.515
The neural implant was
Mitchell's idea, not mine.

15:43.517 --> 15:44.582
- He knew the risks.
- Right.

15:44.584 --> 15:45.984
You had nothing to do with it.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.352
You just pushed him to
out-work and out-think

15:47.354 --> 15:48.720
everyone at your company.

15:48.722 --> 15:49.988
I don't play favorites.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.556
Yet here you are,

15:51.558 --> 15:55.360
putting your gold-digger
wife over your firstborn son.

15:55.362 --> 15:56.428
Okay.

15:56.430 --> 15:58.396
Karen wants your brother out.

15:58.398 --> 16:01.066
It's not a good environment for Justin.

16:01.068 --> 16:04.035
Your genetically enhanced
baby needs an environment?

16:04.037 --> 16:06.905
I thought he was just born
better than the rest of us.

16:06.907 --> 16:09.340
Look, Windrush is a first-class facility.

16:09.342 --> 16:12.444
It's not like I'm throwing
Mitchell out on the street.

16:12.446 --> 16:15.447
You're able to reach Mitchell
better than any of us.

16:15.449 --> 16:19.117
We can help each other.

16:19.119 --> 16:20.652
You know what?

16:24.023 --> 16:26.458
Go fuck yourself.

16:28.295 --> 16:29.861
<i>The corporation demands</i>

16:29.863 --> 16:32.430
<i>your peak performance all the time.</i>

16:32.432 --> 16:35.867
<i>Being pregnant can
rob you of your edge.</i>

16:35.869 --> 16:37.435
<i>The numbers don't lie.</i>

16:37.437 --> 16:39.437
<i>Pregnancy is a leading cause of</i>

16:39.439 --> 16:41.773
<i>marital strife, even divorce.</i>

16:41.775 --> 16:44.776
<i>But there is a better way. Your way.</i>

16:44.778 --> 16:47.378
<i>Your gestator lives under your roof</i>

16:47.380 --> 16:50.048
<i>and eats only a
scientifically-formulated diet</i>

16:50.050 --> 16:53.585
<i>to nurture your fertilized embryo.</i>

16:53.587 --> 16:55.153
<i>It's your baby,</i>

16:55.155 --> 16:57.922
<i>your perfect assortment of genes.</i>

16:57.924 --> 17:00.125
<i>Shouldn't it be on your terms?</i>

17:00.127 --> 17:02.127
_

17:02.129 --> 17:04.662
Ben?

17:04.664 --> 17:06.798
I know it's a lot to process.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.000
What do you think?

17:09.002 --> 17:11.169
I want to have a baby with
you more than anything,

17:11.171 --> 17:15.607
but what I don't want
are any of these options.

17:15.608 --> 17:18.276
What, are you saying that you want me

17:18.278 --> 17:21.679
to have a natural pregnancy?

17:21.681 --> 17:23.948
I want this to be about us.

17:23.950 --> 17:25.116
Don't you?

17:25.117 --> 17:27.285
Well, it's a big decision.

17:27.287 --> 17:29.687
I know, it's just...

17:29.689 --> 17:33.191
Spiga is in every other part of our lives.

17:33.193 --> 17:35.026
Does it have to be in this one?

17:37.696 --> 17:39.430
Sorry I'm late.

17:39.432 --> 17:42.300
I had remote deliveries in
Cleveland and Minneapolis.

17:42.302 --> 17:44.602
It was quite a morning.

17:44.604 --> 17:48.473
Now, before we remove your
IUD, we have a lot to discuss.

17:48.475 --> 17:49.941
We'll make it easy for you.

17:49.943 --> 17:52.377
We're checking "no" on everything.

17:52.379 --> 17:54.145
Everything?

17:54.147 --> 17:55.813
That's right.

17:55.815 --> 17:58.149
No gender choice, no customized features,

17:58.151 --> 17:59.617
no gestator.

17:59.619 --> 18:02.387
I will get pregnant the old-fashioned way

18:02.389 --> 18:04.355
and carry her or

18:04.357 --> 18:05.623
him...

18:05.625 --> 18:06.824
To term.

18:06.826 --> 18:08.526
I'm surprised.

18:08.528 --> 18:11.196
You two don't seem the bohemian types.

18:11.198 --> 18:14.532
Are you onboard with this, Mr. Larson?

18:14.534 --> 18:17.068
100%.

18:17.070 --> 18:18.469
There is just one thing.

18:18.471 --> 18:20.471
Couples opting for a natural pregnancy

18:20.473 --> 18:23.308
must submit to a thorough
genetic screening.

18:23.310 --> 18:25.176
You said our lab work looked good.

18:25.178 --> 18:26.544
It's a liability issue.

18:26.546 --> 18:28.246
If you have any genetic abnormalities,

18:28.248 --> 18:29.514
we would have no way of preventing them

18:29.516 --> 18:32.550
from manifesting in your child.

18:32.552 --> 18:34.152
This will give us

18:34.154 --> 18:36.754
your entire genome with just a fingerprint.

18:36.756 --> 18:38.189
And don't worry; with your backgrounds,

18:38.191 --> 18:40.158
I don't anticipate any problems.

18:45.065 --> 18:46.864
Now your turn, Mr. Larson.

18:55.111 --> 18:56.882
I'm sorry, do you need me to speak slower?

18:56.884 --> 18:59.031
I couldn't be more clear.

18:59.033 --> 19:01.162
I'll handle this, Anton.

19:01.164 --> 19:02.244
How can I help you?

19:02.246 --> 19:04.233
Roger Caplan, Counterintelligence.

19:04.235 --> 19:05.808
I need a personnel file.

19:05.810 --> 19:06.730
I see. Do you have a

19:06.732 --> 19:07.796
signed authorization?

19:07.798 --> 19:08.865
No, I have

19:08.867 --> 19:11.310
an active CI investigation on this girl

19:11.312 --> 19:14.780
and not a lot of time.

19:14.782 --> 19:16.615
Aren't you CI Tech?

19:16.617 --> 19:18.984
This feels a little out of
your purview, doesn't it?

19:18.986 --> 19:20.256
I mean, if I call upstairs,

19:20.258 --> 19:22.454
would they know what you're up to?

19:22.456 --> 19:24.623
Hendrick, right?

19:24.625 --> 19:26.892
How long have you been on the 6th floor?

19:26.894 --> 19:28.428
Nine years.

19:28.429 --> 19:30.295
Nine years without a promotion.

19:30.297 --> 19:32.965
That tells me you don't
like to stick your neck out.

19:32.967 --> 19:34.666
Are you threatening me, Mr. Caplan?

19:34.668 --> 19:38.470
I don't threaten. I incentivize.

19:38.472 --> 19:40.639
I'm up for that promotion on 40.

19:40.641 --> 19:44.142
On my way there, I'm making two lists.

19:44.144 --> 19:45.677
Which one do you want to be on?

19:47.281 --> 19:49.348
I've got the results of your DNA screens.

19:50.818 --> 19:52.117
Laura,

19:52.119 --> 19:53.986
yours show no abnormalities.

19:53.988 --> 19:57.656
Nothing that would pose a
danger to you or your child.

19:57.658 --> 19:58.790
Ben,

19:58.792 --> 20:00.559
your DNA is more problematic.

20:03.162 --> 20:05.631
The red sections show genetic damage

20:05.633 --> 20:07.366
caused by elevated levels of lead

20:07.368 --> 20:09.134
and exposure to malaria,

20:09.136 --> 20:10.669
two things we don't typically see

20:10.671 --> 20:13.338
in people at your strata.

20:13.340 --> 20:15.674
Uh, what's the risk?

20:15.676 --> 20:18.310
Taken together, not
statistically significant,

20:18.312 --> 20:21.747
but it's a risk Spiga isn't going to take.

20:24.117 --> 20:26.685
That's the waiver form,
relieving Spiga of liability

20:26.687 --> 20:27.986
for any medical conditions

20:27.988 --> 20:29.688
that may arise from your decision.

20:29.690 --> 20:32.324
To be clear, if anything goes wrong

20:32.326 --> 20:35.560
the cost is on both of you.

20:35.562 --> 20:37.462
I'll let you discuss it in private.

20:43.170 --> 20:44.970
Lead poisoning, malaria.

20:44.972 --> 20:46.972
I...I don't understand.

20:50.910 --> 20:52.978
There's something I have
to tell you about my past.

20:55.516 --> 20:58.350
What is it?

20:58.352 --> 20:59.985
When I was in college

20:59.987 --> 21:02.921
and the flood hit Seattle,

21:02.923 --> 21:06.258
I told you they airlifted me out.

21:06.260 --> 21:07.325
They didn't.

21:07.327 --> 21:10.929
At least, not right away.

21:10.931 --> 21:13.231
The water was contaminated,
people were getting sick.

21:13.233 --> 21:15.167
There were

21:15.169 --> 21:17.369
bodies everywhere.

21:17.371 --> 21:21.073
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I was ashamed.

21:21.075 --> 21:23.575
I guess I wanted you to
think my life was perfect.

21:23.577 --> 21:25.577
Ben,

21:25.579 --> 21:27.012
do you think my life was perfect

21:27.014 --> 21:28.914
after what happened to me?

21:28.916 --> 21:32.250
What do you want to do?

21:32.252 --> 21:33.285
What we decided.

21:33.287 --> 21:35.987
I want to have our baby.

21:37.523 --> 21:39.124
What about the risk?

21:39.126 --> 21:41.126
People used to have
natural babies all the time

21:41.128 --> 21:43.595
and it worked out fine.

21:43.597 --> 21:46.965
Whatever happened to you in
Seattle made you who you are.

21:46.967 --> 21:49.034
I wouldn't change a thing about you.

21:49.036 --> 21:51.403
Not a single chromosome.

21:51.405 --> 21:52.738
Really?

21:52.740 --> 21:54.239
Hey,

21:54.241 --> 21:57.743
you don't have to hide anything from me.

21:57.745 --> 22:00.645
I know who you are.

22:00.647 --> 22:03.048
I love you.

22:05.785 --> 22:06.718
I love you too.

22:37.817 --> 22:39.518
Yo, you're that fighter, right?

22:39.520 --> 22:40.619
What?

22:40.621 --> 22:42.687
Oh...

22:42.689 --> 22:44.856
I saw you bust up Sayeed.

22:44.858 --> 22:47.526
You painted the cage
with that fucker's blood.

22:47.528 --> 22:48.693
You were there?

22:48.695 --> 22:49.828
Nah.

22:49.830 --> 22:51.429
I watched that shit online.

22:51.431 --> 22:53.198
Over and over.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.499
You like fights?

22:54.501 --> 22:57.202
I like your fights.

22:57.204 --> 22:58.637
Look at us.

22:58.639 --> 23:00.438
Bet they said you were too small too.

23:00.440 --> 23:01.773
But it ain't about the size.

23:01.775 --> 23:03.608
It's about who wants it more.

23:03.610 --> 23:04.576
Am I right?

23:11.150 --> 23:13.885
I'm Spyder.

23:13.887 --> 23:16.221
Theo.

23:16.223 --> 23:17.823
I didn't recognize you at first.

23:17.825 --> 23:19.291
My mom told me to keep my guard up

23:19.293 --> 23:21.660
since I got a scholarship.

23:21.662 --> 23:23.728
What are you doing here?

23:23.730 --> 23:26.131
Road work, you know?

23:26.133 --> 23:27.833
Got to stay sharp.

23:27.835 --> 23:28.900
I hear that.

23:28.902 --> 23:31.236
Well, uh,

23:31.238 --> 23:33.872
I'll let you go, my man.

23:33.874 --> 23:36.408
It's an honor.

23:42.748 --> 23:44.182
Hey, so after you watched my fight

23:44.184 --> 23:46.651
did you guys win your game?

23:46.653 --> 23:48.553
We fragged 'em good.

23:48.555 --> 23:50.722
Well, come on, we got to celebrate.

23:50.724 --> 23:52.824
What, like, like right now?

23:52.826 --> 23:54.659
Well, unless you don't want free drinks

23:54.661 --> 23:58.763
and a chance to meet
the other fighters, huh?

23:58.765 --> 23:59.847
Yeah.

23:59.849 --> 24:01.705
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right, whatever.

24:07.875 --> 24:09.241
Here.

24:09.243 --> 24:11.376
Deceive your wife in good health.

24:11.378 --> 24:12.577
I know you don't believe me,

24:12.579 --> 24:14.179
but this is the best thing for Laura.

24:14.181 --> 24:15.680
You think that's why I dragged you here?

24:15.682 --> 24:17.949
- You got bigger problems.
- What?

24:17.951 --> 24:19.918
Roger Caplan came to my office

24:19.920 --> 24:22.587
with a video of Elena walking into Arcadia

24:22.589 --> 24:25.891
and a bullshit story
about a CI investigation.

24:25.893 --> 24:27.192
You want to take a wild guess

24:27.194 --> 24:28.894
who has your missing keyhole?

24:28.896 --> 24:30.762
Shit.

24:30.764 --> 24:33.031
He asked me about Arcadia this morning.

24:33.033 --> 24:34.399
He was fishing.

24:34.401 --> 24:35.967
He wants her personnel file.

24:35.969 --> 24:37.969
I stonewalled him, but he's not going away.

24:37.971 --> 24:39.137
I just need a bit more time.

24:39.139 --> 24:40.138
You're not listening to me.

24:40.140 --> 24:42.140
This guy is onto you.

24:42.142 --> 24:43.808
And if he finds out who you are,

24:43.810 --> 24:45.877
that leads to me

24:45.879 --> 24:48.380
and my daughter.

24:51.318 --> 24:53.652
He asked for her file?

24:53.654 --> 24:56.087
Then give it to him.

24:56.089 --> 24:57.923
What the hell are you saying?

24:57.925 --> 25:01.559
<i>The file will be so
redacted, it'll be worthless.</i>

25:01.561 --> 25:04.029
<i>But I can use it to
keep an eye on him.</i>

25:04.030 --> 25:04.870
_

25:07.312 --> 25:08.146
_

25:23.990 --> 25:25.972
_

25:34.534 --> 25:35.784
Mitchell?

25:35.786 --> 25:37.019
It's Roger.

25:38.123 --> 25:41.132
Roger Caplan, born April 15th, 2046.

25:41.134 --> 25:42.800
It was a Sunday.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.535
That's right, buddy.

25:44.537 --> 25:46.112
Turning 29 this year.

25:46.114 --> 25:47.513
Crazy, isn't it?

25:49.708 --> 25:51.075
Deal 'em up?

25:54.312 --> 25:55.813
What do I owe you from the last time?

25:55.815 --> 25:59.483
8,346 US dollars.

25:59.485 --> 26:01.752
Serves me right for playing
for 10 bucks a point.

26:06.825 --> 26:10.227
Gin was supposed to be my game, you know?

26:10.229 --> 26:11.996
Back at the Dells, Mom taught me cards

26:11.998 --> 26:14.064
because she saw how mad I used to get

26:14.066 --> 26:16.934
when you beat me at tennis.

26:16.936 --> 26:19.170
Remember that summer?

26:24.242 --> 26:25.943
Mitchell, did Dad

26:25.945 --> 26:28.679
talk to you about Windrush?

26:28.681 --> 26:30.214
The Windrush Center.

26:30.216 --> 26:32.283
A first-class rehabilitation facility

26:32.285 --> 26:34.084
nestled on the banks of Lake Michigan.

26:34.086 --> 26:36.020
That's right.

26:36.022 --> 26:37.937
I brought a viewer immersion to show you.

26:37.939 --> 26:40.558
This is my room. I won't go.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.308
Hear me out.

26:41.310 --> 26:43.394
I won't go.

26:43.396 --> 26:45.763
Gin.

26:45.765 --> 26:48.132
Right. It looks like I owe you...

26:48.134 --> 26:49.466
$740.

26:49.468 --> 26:51.602
$9,086 total.

26:51.604 --> 26:53.537
How about

26:53.539 --> 26:55.639
we call it an even 10 grand

26:55.641 --> 26:57.141
and you look at me?

27:01.998 --> 27:05.532
The implant damaged your amygdala.

27:05.534 --> 27:06.700
Do you know what that is?

27:06.702 --> 27:08.035
The amygdala is the center

27:08.037 --> 27:09.470
of emotional thought in the human brain.

27:09.472 --> 27:11.038
That's right.

27:11.040 --> 27:14.708
Windrush can help repair
the connections you've lost.

27:14.710 --> 27:17.978
This is my room. I won't go.

27:17.980 --> 27:20.481
Deal them up.

27:27.956 --> 27:30.024
You know,

27:30.026 --> 27:31.558
I hate Dad

27:31.560 --> 27:34.995
just as much as you do.

27:34.997 --> 27:36.530
You hate Dad?

27:36.532 --> 27:38.732
That's right.

27:38.734 --> 27:40.134
The difference is

27:40.136 --> 27:42.536
I can do something about it.

27:42.538 --> 27:44.371
I get this promotion I'm up for,

27:44.373 --> 27:46.040
the next step's division president.

27:46.042 --> 27:47.174
With that kind of clout,

27:47.176 --> 27:49.476
I can get him fired and expelled,

27:49.478 --> 27:50.844
with that bitch Karen

27:50.846 --> 27:53.981
and their stupid bionic baby.

27:53.983 --> 27:56.050
Let the skints have at them.

27:56.052 --> 27:57.584
The skints.

27:59.254 --> 28:01.722
All I need

28:01.724 --> 28:03.724
is for you to go to Windrush,

28:03.726 --> 28:05.659
just for a little while.

28:05.661 --> 28:07.428
After that, we'll have Dad's money.

28:07.430 --> 28:09.496
And this house,

28:09.498 --> 28:11.265
you can have it all to yourself.

28:16.104 --> 28:18.339
I'll go to Windrush,

28:18.341 --> 28:20.307
for a little while.

28:22.789 --> 28:24.345
Let the skints have at 'em.

28:26.351 --> 28:29.169
_

28:41.277 --> 28:43.429
_

29:07.889 --> 29:09.757
How are you feeling?

29:12.660 --> 29:13.927
They say the baby's fine.

29:13.929 --> 29:15.596
That's all that matters.

29:18.900 --> 29:20.467
And Michael?

29:20.469 --> 29:22.669
Michael buried you yesterday.

29:22.671 --> 29:26.240
He played the part of the
grieving husband beautifully.

29:26.242 --> 29:29.610
Inazagi has no reason to suspect a thing.

29:29.612 --> 29:32.479
He'll never see me again.

29:32.481 --> 29:35.315
And even if he did, he'd
be looking at a stranger.

29:35.317 --> 29:37.684
You asked for the full relocation package

29:37.686 --> 29:39.920
and you got it.

29:39.922 --> 29:42.456
Now it's your turn.

29:42.458 --> 29:45.559
What's this intel I've
risked my career for?

29:47.796 --> 29:50.697
Well, there's this whiz kid,

29:50.699 --> 29:52.032
Sanjay Maraj.

29:52.034 --> 29:54.368
Summa cum laude from Beijing University,

29:54.370 --> 29:57.471
one of those open-source gene splicers.

29:57.473 --> 29:59.640
Real bleeding heart.

30:00.809 --> 30:02.843
Kid wanted to feed the world.

30:02.845 --> 30:05.779
Then he realized a school
could never finance his vision

30:05.781 --> 30:08.182
so he finally accepted our offer.

30:08.184 --> 30:10.717
To do what, exactly?

30:10.719 --> 30:12.486
We got it all wrong, Elizabeth.

30:12.488 --> 30:16.123
There is so much water
out there in the world.

30:16.125 --> 30:17.291
More than enough.

30:17.293 --> 30:19.026
Sure, seawater.

30:19.028 --> 30:22.321
But if you could use it to irrigate.

30:22.323 --> 30:25.657
If you could make your crops salt tolerant.

30:25.659 --> 30:26.658
That's impossible.

30:26.660 --> 30:28.127
Mangroves do it.

30:28.129 --> 30:29.870
And Sanjay's about to.

30:33.909 --> 30:36.009
And that's how you conquer the desert.

30:36.011 --> 30:38.579
That's right.

30:38.581 --> 30:41.548
Iowa, Missouri, Kansas.

30:41.550 --> 30:43.717
We could take back all
the dust-storm states,

30:43.719 --> 30:46.386
all Inazagi territory.

30:46.388 --> 30:48.422
Or Spiga's.

30:49.924 --> 30:51.925
How do I find this miracle worker?

30:51.927 --> 30:54.428
Mm, that's Inazagi's best kept secret.

30:54.430 --> 30:55.929
I mean, I could give you my best guess

30:55.931 --> 30:58.465
but the rest is up to you.

31:02.604 --> 31:05.405
Oh, one last thing.

31:05.407 --> 31:07.574
Robert Frost.

31:07.576 --> 31:10.110
How did you know?

31:10.112 --> 31:11.378
I was accompanying

31:11.380 --> 31:14.848
your husband before he died.

31:14.850 --> 31:17.017
I hope you will forgive me.

31:18.887 --> 31:21.355
Just business.

31:21.357 --> 31:23.357
So is this.

31:23.359 --> 31:26.360
If you ever tell anybody about him,

31:26.362 --> 31:29.196
your people think you're already dead.

31:38.755 --> 31:39.858
All right.

31:39.860 --> 31:42.634
Now you know how I felt after
that right cross from Sayeed.

31:47.559 --> 31:48.760
Give me a sec.

31:52.808 --> 31:54.642
What are you trying to pull, kid?

31:54.644 --> 31:56.590
You gave me a job.

31:56.592 --> 31:58.968
I'm doing it the best way I know how.

31:58.970 --> 32:02.016
I get him drunk, he won't feel anything.

32:03.134 --> 32:04.868
Long as you get it done.

32:11.927 --> 32:13.394
I got a confession,

32:13.396 --> 32:16.620
I've never had a drink before, like,

32:16.622 --> 32:18.144
right now.

32:18.146 --> 32:19.463
You're 17.

32:19.465 --> 32:21.853
I was cooking beet-shine when I was 12.

32:21.855 --> 32:23.521
When my folks realized I could ball,

32:23.523 --> 32:25.923
they wouldn't allow it.

32:25.925 --> 32:27.812
Then here's to not
listening to your parents.

32:27.814 --> 32:31.472
All right.

32:31.474 --> 32:33.499
Another one?

32:33.501 --> 32:34.754
I don't blame 'em.

32:34.756 --> 32:37.101
I mean, look at me, I'm getting
out of here 'cause of 'em.

32:37.103 --> 32:39.136
- Your scholarship?
- Fuck yeah.

32:39.138 --> 32:40.757
And when I get my degree,

32:40.759 --> 32:43.274
I'ma bring 'em out with me.

32:43.276 --> 32:46.244
My sister said the same thing.

32:46.246 --> 32:50.035
It didn't work out though, but she tried.

32:50.037 --> 32:52.344
- No shit?
- Yeah.

32:52.346 --> 32:53.706
What's her name?

32:53.708 --> 32:54.719
Elena.

32:57.197 --> 32:59.565
To Elena.

33:11.044 --> 33:12.187
Mom.

33:12.189 --> 33:13.989
I'm sorry to barge in on you

33:13.991 --> 33:15.982
like this. Can I come in?

33:19.419 --> 33:21.120
Is something wrong?

33:21.122 --> 33:22.989
Something happened at work today

33:22.991 --> 33:25.558
that got to me, that's all.

33:25.560 --> 33:28.427
Are you all right?

33:28.429 --> 33:30.596
I shouldn't really be telling you this,

33:30.598 --> 33:32.598
but we ran a covert op

33:32.600 --> 33:34.400
involving a pregnant woman

33:34.402 --> 33:37.003
and it didn't go as planned

33:37.005 --> 33:38.804
and she lost the baby.

33:38.806 --> 33:40.439
I'm so sorry.

33:40.441 --> 33:41.440
I saw her today;

33:41.442 --> 33:44.277
she was devastated.

33:44.279 --> 33:46.312
Tell me this doesn't
have anything to do with

33:46.314 --> 33:47.847
my visit to the OB-GYN.

33:47.849 --> 33:50.116
- Laura...
- Oh, of course.

33:50.118 --> 33:51.984
The release we signed went directly to you.

33:51.986 --> 33:54.287
You're here because we're
having a natural pregnancy.

33:54.289 --> 33:56.756
Elizabeth.

33:56.758 --> 33:58.354
What are you doing here?

33:58.356 --> 34:00.626
She's trying to talk me
out of carrying our baby.

34:00.628 --> 34:02.595
I'm trying to keep your baby safe.

34:02.597 --> 34:04.797
My daughter doesn't seem to understand

34:04.799 --> 34:06.132
the kind of world we live in.

34:06.134 --> 34:07.667
I understand perfectly.

34:07.669 --> 34:09.635
I see your housekeeper isn't here.

34:09.637 --> 34:12.972
What have you told Ben
about why you fired her?

34:12.974 --> 34:15.507
You haven't told him
about the riot you started

34:15.510 --> 34:16.775
at the servant gate?

34:18.179 --> 34:20.379
Yeah, she told me all about it.

34:20.380 --> 34:22.117
The important thing is that she's okay.

34:22.119 --> 34:24.350
What if she's pregnant and
she pulls a stunt like that?

34:24.351 --> 34:27.286
There are reasons people
like us use gestators.

34:27.288 --> 34:29.455
It's just common sense.

34:31.326 --> 34:33.292
Elizabeth, I understand your concern,

34:33.293 --> 34:35.226
but this is our decision.

34:35.228 --> 34:37.063
Is it your final decision?

34:39.900 --> 34:41.967
Yes.

34:41.969 --> 34:43.039
And we discussed it,

34:43.041 --> 34:45.328
and it's what we want for our family.

34:48.708 --> 34:50.743
Well, if that's your position.

34:54.481 --> 34:56.649
I'll see you at tomorrow's presentation.

35:02.490 --> 35:03.990
It was a medical emergency.

35:03.992 --> 35:05.322
I was trying to help Rachel's friend.

35:05.324 --> 35:07.257
- I should've told you.
- It's okay.

35:07.259 --> 35:08.904
It's okay.

35:08.906 --> 35:10.274
You're not upset?

35:10.276 --> 35:13.165
I'm only upset that you felt
like you couldn't tell me.

35:13.167 --> 35:14.900
I know who you are too.

35:23.077 --> 35:25.378
Then how about we make a baby right now?

35:39.726 --> 35:42.094
Whoo!

35:42.096 --> 35:45.731
Oh, I... I...

35:45.733 --> 35:47.700
I gotta... I gotta rest a second.

35:47.702 --> 35:49.602
Glad I got this out of the way

35:49.604 --> 35:51.370
before college.

35:51.372 --> 35:53.806
Never again.

35:55.275 --> 35:57.777
- Take this.
- What?

35:57.779 --> 36:00.479
Take it and get out of town.

36:00.481 --> 36:02.314
The guy your mom warned you about?

36:02.316 --> 36:04.950
It's me.

36:04.952 --> 36:08.621
I'm supposed to break your
legs so you can't play.

36:08.623 --> 36:09.655
What... what are you saying?

36:09.657 --> 36:10.923
Listen to me.

36:10.925 --> 36:12.958
We don't have much time.

36:12.960 --> 36:15.127
I'm gonna tell them that you fought back

36:15.129 --> 36:17.496
and I had to kill you,
and I dumped your body.

36:17.498 --> 36:19.298
But that means you have to go now

36:19.300 --> 36:21.634
and you can never come
back because if you do,

36:21.636 --> 36:25.304
they will kill you and your family.

36:25.306 --> 36:26.772
Do you understand what I'm saying?

36:26.774 --> 36:28.074
You have to go!

36:32.412 --> 36:34.346
Where am I gonna go?

36:34.348 --> 36:36.148
Tell me!

36:36.150 --> 36:40.086
My family is here.

36:40.088 --> 36:41.987
I have nothing else.

36:41.989 --> 36:43.489
Go anywhere.

36:43.491 --> 36:46.158
With this?

36:46.160 --> 36:47.793
This won't do shit for me.

36:47.795 --> 36:51.263
You just want to buy
yourself a clean conscience.

36:53.700 --> 36:55.968
There.

36:55.970 --> 36:58.671
You're my hero again.

36:58.673 --> 37:01.373
That's what you wanted, right?

37:01.375 --> 37:03.042
What do you want from me?

37:03.044 --> 37:04.677
You said it.

37:04.679 --> 37:06.045
The next guy they send

37:06.047 --> 37:09.048
is gonna kill me for sure.

37:09.050 --> 37:11.617
You got a job to do.

37:12.820 --> 37:15.121
So do it.

37:18.025 --> 37:19.291
Come on!

37:19.293 --> 37:20.526
Do it, you fucking coward!

37:20.528 --> 37:21.894
Do your job!

37:26.800 --> 37:28.667
Is that what you did to your sister?

37:28.669 --> 37:30.536
You fuck her over too?

37:30.538 --> 37:32.071
And I thought you were a champ.

37:32.073 --> 37:34.373
You ain't nothing but a thug.

37:34.375 --> 37:36.375
You're gonna die in that cage.

37:36.377 --> 37:37.810
People are gonna cheer.

37:37.812 --> 37:40.379
That's gonna be the
last thing that you hear

37:40.381 --> 37:41.514
is people cheering

37:41.516 --> 37:42.915
'cause you're dead!

37:55.162 --> 37:56.896
Open Design-Gro.

38:26.641 --> 38:27.641
What is this?

38:27.643 --> 38:28.631
20,000.

38:28.633 --> 38:31.545
That's the buy-in
for the co-ops.

38:31.547 --> 38:33.647
- The co-ops?
- Just hear me out.

38:33.649 --> 38:36.259
They're not a pipe
dream; they're real farms.

38:36.261 --> 38:39.352
Open source seeds, no
corporations, no cartels.

38:39.354 --> 38:41.835
And they want people
like you, young, educated.

38:41.837 --> 38:44.608
There's a buy-in, but I got it.

38:44.610 --> 38:45.809
Where did you get this?

38:45.811 --> 38:48.311
It doesn't matter.

38:48.313 --> 38:49.325
Aaron...

38:49.327 --> 38:50.656
I'm not gonna lie to you, it's hard work.

38:50.658 --> 38:53.717
It's the land that nobody wants,

38:53.719 --> 38:57.053
but it'll be ours.

38:57.055 --> 38:59.055
Hey, it's okay.

38:59.057 --> 39:01.224
We'll send for Theo

39:01.226 --> 39:04.033
and your dad if he doesn't shoot me first.

39:04.035 --> 39:05.962
No, that's not it.

39:18.406 --> 39:20.245
You got the scholarship?

39:20.247 --> 39:22.746
The winner got caught cheating.

39:22.748 --> 39:25.348
Neural implant.

39:25.350 --> 39:27.184
It's mine now.

39:30.371 --> 39:31.885
I won't take it.

39:31.887 --> 39:33.440
You're gonna pass on a college scholarship?

39:33.442 --> 39:34.894
This is your ticket out of all this.

39:34.896 --> 39:36.992
It's my choice.

39:36.994 --> 39:38.353
And what about your family?

39:38.355 --> 39:41.156
Every cent they saved was for this.

39:41.158 --> 39:43.989
You don't want me to come with you?

39:43.991 --> 39:46.889
Not if you're gonna regret it.

39:46.891 --> 39:50.066
Look, this isn't some number
you hit in Tino's food lottery.

39:50.068 --> 39:53.535
You earned this.

39:53.537 --> 39:58.073
I can't leave you.

39:58.075 --> 39:59.708
You don't have to.

39:59.710 --> 40:01.359
And you know what you're
gonna need over the wall?

40:01.361 --> 40:03.361
A chauffeur.

40:03.363 --> 40:05.197
The cars drive themselves.

40:29.522 --> 40:31.289
Aaron!

40:31.291 --> 40:32.457
We have to go.

40:36.712 --> 40:39.114
Well, the clarity hasn't budged much.

40:42.184 --> 40:44.719
You have any solves for
the programming exploit?

40:47.526 --> 40:49.019
Ben?

40:49.021 --> 40:52.763
What adjustments do you want
me to make for the rendering?

40:52.765 --> 40:53.877
I have to go.

40:53.879 --> 40:54.966
Go? Wait.

40:54.968 --> 40:56.940
The presentation's at 1:00.

40:56.989 --> 40:57.955
Ben?

40:59.694 --> 41:02.462
Got it, thank you.

41:03.531 --> 41:05.532
They're almost here.

41:05.534 --> 41:07.334
Great.

41:07.336 --> 41:09.069
If this goes sideways,

41:09.071 --> 41:13.073
Elizabeth Krauss will have me by
the balls for the rest of my life.

41:13.075 --> 41:15.075
Sounds like you're more
afraid of her than I am.

41:15.077 --> 41:16.476
I mean it.

41:16.478 --> 41:19.646
The day that woman's out of my life.

41:19.648 --> 41:21.147
I'll be careful.

41:25.136 --> 41:27.170
Be smart.

41:27.172 --> 41:30.640
Arcadia trained this girl to keep
her mouth shut and her legs open.

41:30.642 --> 41:32.916
I was raised by an unapologetic asshole,

41:32.918 --> 41:34.915
so when it comes to breaking people down,

41:34.917 --> 41:37.781
I learned from the very best.

41:37.783 --> 41:40.116
That was almost convincing.

41:47.546 --> 41:48.664
_

42:00.634 --> 42:02.093
_

42:09.680 --> 42:10.914
Step aside.
