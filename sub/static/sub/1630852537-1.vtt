02:29.840 --> 02:31.640
You sure Crocker hasn't called?

02:31.640 --> 02:34.600
He was supposed to meet me here
a half-hour ago.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.720
Another drink while you're waiting,
Mr Whitney?

02:36.720 --> 02:38.080
Please! Seven's my limit.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.320
Hear you're off to England,
Mr Whitney.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.080
Big stuff, Fred, the biggest.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.120
Business, huh?
Henley Regatta.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.080
Boot the Yale boat home.

02:48.080 --> 02:51.680
Bulldog, Bulldog, bow wow wow.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.920
♪ Eli Yale! ♪

02:53.920 --> 02:55.200
Play ball!

02:55.200 --> 02:57.760
Crocker! Where the hell have you
been? You're a half hour late.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.080
Relax, bass, I have been
taking care of business.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.840
I've got your steamer ticket,
English money, train ticket

03:02.840 --> 03:06.760
up to Henley, and I picked
Little Eli up at Brooks Brothers.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.960
New letter sweater looks terrific!

03:08.960 --> 03:10.160
Oh!

03:10.160 --> 03:11.240
What about my passport?

03:11.240 --> 03:13.080
Nuts! Oh, I'm sorry, boss.

03:13.080 --> 03:14.840
I'll pick it up first thing
in the morning,

03:14.840 --> 03:16.320
and bring it to you
down on the boat.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.800
Damn it, Crocker, I want you down on
Wall Street first thing

03:18.800 --> 03:20.440
in the morning to sell
all my shares...

03:22.640 --> 03:25.560
..to sell all my shares
of Amalgamated Prestoleum.

03:25.560 --> 03:28.560
But boss, the firm's entire assets
are tied up in Amalgamated.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.520
I got a hot tip
from Charlie Blodgett.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.320
Amalgamated's going to sink
like the Titanic.

03:33.320 --> 03:36.120
You always told me Charlie Blodgett
was a liar and a drunk.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.480
He is.

03:37.480 --> 03:40.080
But he's a Yale man.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.520
One for the road, sir?

03:41.520 --> 03:43.760
Yeah, make it a double.

03:43.760 --> 03:45.160
Goodnight, gentlemen.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.000
Anybody call for me, Fred?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.560
Yeah, Harriet, Nancy, Lorraine...

03:52.560 --> 03:53.960
Two Lorraines.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.120
How about a Hope? Hope Harcourt?

03:56.120 --> 03:58.600
No, but there was a lady came in
asking for you.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.640
He's wrong, Billy. It was only me.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.240
Reno!

04:05.160 --> 04:07.360
Oh, my God. We had a date.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.400
That's OK. I'd say forget it,
but you already did.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.720
Reno, I am so sorry.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.320
My boss is going to London
first thing in the morning,

04:13.320 --> 04:15.520
I had a thousand things to do
for him.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.960
I'M going to London in the morning,

04:16.960 --> 04:18.760
and all you had to do for me
was buy me a drink.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.040
What'll it be, ma'am?

04:20.040 --> 04:22.600
A martini, only make it with rye and
put a cherry in it

04:22.600 --> 04:24.760
instead of an olive.
Yeah, two Manhattans, Fred.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.440
You know, I'm getting worried
about you, Billy.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.520
I don't think this Wall Street job
is good for you.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.080
Hey, I'm making $35 a week!

04:31.080 --> 04:32.800
Yeah, but look at you.
Look at your coat.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.440
What's the matter with my coat?
It's got a fried egg on the pocket.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.720
That's an old school crest.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.320
From where? PS 88?

04:38.320 --> 04:39.760
You're in trouble, kid.

04:39.760 --> 04:42.680
If you keep acting like
a stuffed shirt stockbroker,

04:42.680 --> 04:45.120
you're going to turn into one.
Why do I put up with this, Fred?

04:45.120 --> 04:46.920
You're nuts about me.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.560
In fact, I've got a great idea.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.760
Why don't you come to London
with me?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.120
Reno, be serious.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.040
I am serious.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.280
England won't be the same
without you.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.760
Nah, guys like me
are a dime a dozen.

You won't miss me over there.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.480
from last night.
Aye, aye, sir.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.160
Would you just calm down?

11:19.160 --> 11:21.800
How can I calm down?

we're not, and why? Why?!

pretending to be something that he's
not? Half the passengers...

Hey, captain,
where's the celebrities?

11:50.760 --> 11:54.240
Not THE Henry T Dobson?!

Cut the bushwah.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.320

I'm on the way to the Westminster
conference where I shall present

12:01.520 --> 12:04.920
my two newest converts,
Luke and John.

12:07.520 --> 12:12.240
Luke here was a compulsive gambler,
who, as a reminder of his former

12:12.240 --> 12:14.480
shame, still carries with him
a deck of cards.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.640
And poor John
was a compulsive drinker...

12:16.640 --> 12:19.160

now getting somewhere!

12:19.160 --> 12:21.720

doing on board this tub?

12:21.720 --> 12:23.640
Same thing I do at my nightclub,
boys.

12:23.640 --> 12:26.240
I'll be saving sinners twice a night
in the ship's lounge.

Hi.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.640
The easy kind, no doubt.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.440
Say, brother, was that a pass?

12:41.440 --> 12:45.080
Miss Sweeney, I have no interest
in either you or your fallen angels.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.400
I'm ashamed to be seen in public
with you.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.160
How about a picture, boys?
Yes, please.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.160
If you could just hold there.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.040
Make sure to send a couple
to the Archbishop.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.600
Luke! John!

12:56.600 --> 12:58.840
Bye!
I tell you, boys,

12:58.840 --> 13:01.400
it ain't easy being New York's
most notorious evangelist.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.160

beside distilled waters?

13:08.040 --> 13:10.040
What?

13:10.040 --> 13:11.520
Which way to the bar?

13:11.520 --> 13:13.280
Oh, just through there.
Thank you.

13:13.280 --> 13:16.880
Oh, hey, girls,
give us the hallelujah.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.480

Hey, Miss Harcourt, are you
presiding at the gold and silver

13:26.960 --> 13:29.400
ball this year? How about the
Newport cotillion?

13:29.400 --> 13:32.200
Gentlemen, my daughter's
debutante days are over.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.320
She's about to be married.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.800
Married?!
Yes, it's true.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.800
I'm marrying Lord Evelyn Oakleigh.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.880
We're getting married
at St Paul's Cathedral,

13:40.880 --> 13:42.920
and I'm very, very happy.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.360
Hey, Edith, how about a smooch?

13:45.360 --> 13:46.840
I beg your pardon?

13:46.840 --> 13:49.480
That's a kiss, your Highness.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.680
No! How marvellous!

13:51.680 --> 13:55.480
You know, I'm making a collection
of expressions you Americans use.

13:55.480 --> 13:58.680
"A smooch is a kiss."

13:59.800 --> 14:02.280
I say, darling, how about a smooch?

14:04.960 --> 14:08.520
Egad! Evangeline Harcourt!

14:08.520 --> 14:10.560

14:14.080 --> 14:17.160
Eli, you haven't changed
in 40 years.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.520
Me?! Look at you!

14:19.520 --> 14:22.080

how to fill a girdle.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.560
Eli, really!

14:23.560 --> 14:26.440
Have some respect for the memory
of my late husband.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.240
Of course, forgive me.

14:28.240 --> 14:33.040
You know, if it's any consolation,
I was just coming out of

14:33.040 --> 14:36.280
the stock exchange when he took off
from that ledge.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.920
He jumped like a Yale man.

14:45.320 --> 14:46.680
Thank you, Eli.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.240
Boss, your passport.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.400
Oh, my gosh!
Eli, you know my daughter Hope.

14:50.400 --> 14:54.400
And this is her fiance,
Lord Evelyn Oakleigh.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.720
Her fiance?

14:55.720 --> 14:58.920
German word, Crocker.
It means they're getting married.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.760
I don't believe it!
I still don't either.

15:00.760 --> 15:04.160
And yet a week from now,
my little Hope will be a Lady.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.640
This calls for a drink!
Come along, everybody.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.320
Isn't Mr Crocker going to join us?

15:08.320 --> 15:10.760
No, no. He's got a date
down on Wall Street.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.720
Get going, Crocker,
and sell those shares.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.320
Yes, sir.
This way, my dear.

15:14.320 --> 15:15.600
Hope, wait...

15:17.960 --> 15:24.840
All ashore that's going ashore.
All ashore that's going ashore.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.120
Who is God?
The creator of all things.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.120
Where is God?
God is everywhere.

15:30.120 --> 15:31.680
And what does God know?

15:31.680 --> 15:34.680
Who's going to win
the Kentucky derby.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.000
You, have you seen a minister?

15:37.000 --> 15:38.240
A what?

15:38.240 --> 15:42.000
FBI. We're looking for a gangster
dressed up like a minister.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.320
You seen him?
Yeah, he went that way.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.240
Show us.
I've got to see somebody in the bar.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.680
Show us.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.560
Look, guys, I really don't have time
for this.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.840
Was it this way?
This is ridiculous. Come on.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.560
Psst! Moonie!

15:57.560 --> 15:59.400
The coast is clear.
Erma!

16:01.760 --> 16:03.160
Erma! Hey!

16:04.400 --> 16:06.120
Are we in England yet?

16:06.120 --> 16:08.240
Where's Snake Eyes?
He hasn't showed.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.600
To hell with Snake Eyes!

16:09.600 --> 16:12.280
Come on, he's public enemy number
one, he can take care of himself.

16:12.280 --> 16:14.560
Oh, my God, you don't suppose
the cops nabbed him?

16:14.560 --> 16:16.800
I've got to find him! Snake Eyes!

16:16.800 --> 16:19.040
Snake Eyes!
Quiet! Quiet!

16:19.040 --> 16:21.400
We're trying to make a getaway here,
OK? Mm-hm.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.800
Erma, just...

16:22.800 --> 16:24.720
Now look what you made me do.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.360
That's my "straddle various."

16:26.360 --> 16:29.160
Ah! A fellow cleric.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.920
No, I'm out of here.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.520
Allow me to introduce myself,
Doctor.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.320
The Reverend Henry T Dobson.
Yeah.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.640
Are you on your way
to the conference?

16:37.640 --> 16:40.360
No, I was thinking of
going to bed early tonight, OK?

16:40.360 --> 16:43.080
Oh, I mean the Westminster
conference.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.440
No, you see,
I'm not a west minister.

16:45.440 --> 16:48.000
I'm more in the east.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.040
What is your field, Doctor?

16:50.040 --> 16:51.640
Me, I'm a missionary.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.760
A missionary! Where?
Way out in China.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.520
Oh, I served in China for years!

16:56.520 --> 16:58.760
Oh, wow, that's amazing.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.200
Well, I wasn't actually in China,
I was more...

17:01.200 --> 17:04.560
Oh, I see, you were in Indochina.

17:04.560 --> 17:07.800
That's right, I was,
it was Indoor China, yeah, yeah.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.280
And you were...

17:09.280 --> 17:11.120
Outdoor China!

17:12.720 --> 17:14.240
That's so funny.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.960
Yes. We'll have lots to talk about.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.320
Sure.

17:19.320 --> 17:21.280
I'm sorry?

17:23.080 --> 17:25.280
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.640
Hey, there he is!

17:26.640 --> 17:29.440
FBI! Gotcha, Moon.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.240
Unhand me this instant!

17:31.240 --> 17:34.120
I am the Reverend Henry T Dobson!

17:34.120 --> 17:35.840
Save it for the judge, buddy.

17:35.840 --> 17:38.320
Oh, my God, they're taking him away!

17:38.320 --> 17:40.560
He's gone! He's gone!
What are we going to do?

17:40.560 --> 17:44.120
Excuse me, captain,
is there a casino on the ship?

17:44.120 --> 17:46.120
Why, no.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.480
There is now.

17:49.480 --> 17:50.920
Luke, stop! What are you doing?

17:50.920 --> 17:52.920
We're going to end up in the brig!

17:52.920 --> 17:56.720
I just wanted to say
bon voyage to the lady, boss.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.760
You'll be saying bon voyage
to your job, Crocker,

17:58.760 --> 18:00.960
unless you get the hell off
this boat!

18:02.480 --> 18:04.200
I can find Snake Eyes anywhere!

18:04.200 --> 18:06.640
What will I do? He's my man!
He's my life!

18:06.640 --> 18:08.760
Erma, Erma, forget Snake Eyes!

18:12.080 --> 18:13.720
Final call!

18:13.720 --> 18:16.480
All ashore that's going ashore.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.120
You blew it, Snake Eyes!

18:18.120 --> 18:20.200
Now what'll I do with his passport
and ticket?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.480
Could you let me have them?
Who are you?

18:22.480 --> 18:24.440
Give him the goods, come on,
he saved my ass.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.160
Thanks a lot.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.000

danced, had a little too much wine,

we took a little spin
round the park.

No, you can't go out there.

Why, yes. Oh, no. The captain has
asked me to find you.

44:34.720 --> 44:38.080
The ship has hit an iceberg.

places for you and your daughter.

44:47.560 --> 44:50.080
Billy, this isn't fair.
Who cares if it's fair?

44:50.080 --> 44:52.680
The ship is sinking. I'm going to...

44:52.680 --> 44:55.920
Oh, do I have time to go back
for my jewellery?

44:55.920 --> 44:58.920
Hurry, and remember,
not a word to anyone.

45:00.400 --> 45:02.480
I hope you're proud of yourself,
Billy.

45:02.480 --> 45:04.160
Now that you mention it, I am.

45:04.160 --> 45:06.720
12 hours after you tell me
to leave you alone forever,

45:06.720 --> 45:08.920
I've got you all to myself.

45:08.920 --> 45:10.800
Oops, sorry, madam.

45:10.800 --> 45:14.720
Not quite all to yourself.
Good morning, Mr Whitney.

45:14.720 --> 45:17.840
Oh, hello, my dear.
Yeah, I'm looking for a sailor.

45:17.840 --> 45:21.440
Take a look at this one.
Ah, now, I want to send a wire.

45:21.440 --> 45:25.120
This goes to William Crocker,
Whitney Building, New York City.

45:25.120 --> 45:29.200
"Crocker, wire confirmation
of amalgamated sale at once."

45:29.200 --> 45:32.520
Got that? Mm-hm.
Better have him read it back.

45:34.480 --> 45:36.960
"Crocker, wire confirmation

45:36.960 --> 45:39.200
"of amalgamated sale at once."

45:39.200 --> 45:43.040
You know, you remind me of somebody.
Look out!

45:44.520 --> 45:47.360
What was that?
The biggest seagull I ever saw!

45:47.360 --> 45:48.840
What?

45:48.840 --> 45:51.920
Oh! Got to run! I'll see you later!

45:59.600 --> 46:01.920
They've gone!

46:01.920 --> 46:04.120
Oh, captain, thank God!

46:04.120 --> 46:06.240
Where do I go?

46:08.440 --> 46:10.360
Where would you like to go?

46:12.320 --> 46:16.680
The lifeboat. Oh, the lifeboat drill
is tomorrow morning, madam.

46:16.680 --> 46:19.080
But the sailor told us...
Told you what?

46:19.080 --> 46:20.600
That the ship is sinking.

46:20.600 --> 46:24.360
What?! A joke, ladies and gentlemen.

46:24.360 --> 46:27.320
She's only joshing.

46:28.720 --> 46:32.600
I suggest you have a little talk
with the ship's doctor, madam.

46:32.600 --> 46:35.760
And in the meantime,
stay out of the bar.

46:37.680 --> 46:42.200
Go on, go on, just do what
I told you. But what if it's...?

46:44.640 --> 46:50.080
Excuse me, Father. Yeah? Can I
assist you in some way, my son?

46:50.080 --> 46:52.920
Brother Luke has been
playing cards... Mm-hm.

46:52.920 --> 46:55.200
Look. Yeah, that's the wages of sin.

46:55.200 --> 46:58.000
For shame,
go hail a few Marys, will you?

46:58.000 --> 47:00.600
So, you've been playing cards, yeah?

47:00.600 --> 47:02.800
Can you shoot craps?

47:02.800 --> 47:05.520
No. Kneel, Christian. Watch closely.

47:05.520 --> 47:08.360
Right, put up your money.
I've put up my money.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.640
I throw a number.

47:09.640 --> 47:12.240
If I throw the same number
before I throw a seven, I win.

47:12.240 --> 47:14.040
If not, you win.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.520
Bah!

47:15.520 --> 47:17.080
Craps! I win.

47:21.640 --> 47:23.800
There's something wrong here.

47:23.800 --> 47:27.040
Hey, thanks a lot. Yeah,
don't mention it. What did I do?

47:27.040 --> 47:28.280
You walked out on me.

47:28.280 --> 47:29.880
I nearly got nailed by my boss,

47:29.880 --> 47:33.040
and everyone's pointing at me
in this stupid disguise.

47:33.040 --> 47:36.400
Don't knock the disguise! Come on,
it's practically as good as mine.

47:36.400 --> 47:38.120
Hey, Billy, how you doing? Uh-huh...

47:38.120 --> 47:40.280
Moonface Martin, long time, no see!

47:40.280 --> 47:42.080
Reno, quiet! OK, quiet!

47:42.080 --> 47:44.160
You don't know me. I'm a hunted man.

47:44.160 --> 47:46.120
Oh, there he is! Don't shoot!

47:46.120 --> 47:49.200
I'm flying fish,
there go the flying fish. My God.

47:51.880 --> 47:54.280
Dr, have you seen Mr Cleaners? Yeah.

47:54.280 --> 47:57.440
As a matter of fact, I think I saw
him going into the mizzen mast.

47:59.840 --> 48:03.560
We don't have a mizzen mast.
Yeah, must have been someone else.

48:05.440 --> 48:08.040
Sailor, come with me. I want you
to help me find someone.

48:08.040 --> 48:09.200
Aye, aye, sir.

48:10.200 --> 48:12.640
Who's he looking for?
He's looking for Billy.

48:13.960 --> 48:15.960
Billy ought to be a big help to him.

48:17.360 --> 48:23.440
What-ho! It's Reno Sweeney.
I say, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh.

48:23.440 --> 48:25.120
Might I have your autograph?

48:25.120 --> 48:29.120
Why not? Do you know, I spent the
most smashing night in your club.

48:29.120 --> 48:31.040
Lawdy lawdy! Saints preserve us!

48:31.040 --> 48:33.400
Your singing stirred me
into a frenzy.

48:33.400 --> 48:36.760
Had me dancing about like Bojingles.

48:36.760 --> 48:38.480
Thank you.

48:38.480 --> 48:42.160
"Are you drunk or crazy?
Good luck, Reno Sweeney."

48:46.120 --> 48:48.800
Oh, I say, why don't we all have tea
in my cabin?

48:48.800 --> 48:51.160
I know that my fiance, Ms Harcourt,
would love to meet you.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.120
That's very sweet of you,
but I'm afraid that...

48:53.120 --> 48:56.440
Yeah, she'd love to. Oh, marvellous!
Shall we say four o'clock?

48:56.440 --> 48:58.440

and then we blackmail him
into breaking off the engagement.

49:21.120 --> 49:23.840

No, you're... I don't know,

52:45.760 --> 52:47.960
Yeah, we are partners.
And you threw me off there.

52:47.960 --> 52:49.680
Just for the moment,
just for the song, OK?

52:49.680 --> 52:52.600
I thought that we were...
What's your problem?

52:53.600 --> 52:55.840
What?

52:55.840 --> 52:57.720
Oh, yeah. I forgot about them.

52:57.720 --> 52:59.000
Hi.

53:02.360 --> 53:04.880
What are you waving for?
I don't know. They...

53:04.880 --> 53:07.440
I just thought I'd...
We're supposed to be at sea.

53:09.560 --> 53:12.040
Look, we've got to come up
with a big ending, OK?

53:12.040 --> 53:13.760
I don't like the look of the crowd.

53:15.160 --> 53:16.560
OK. Let's go for it.

53:20.640 --> 53:22.760
No, I need another breath.

53:22.760 --> 53:25.800
OK, you ready? Oh, yes. Please.

get it wrong? I'm just putting...

Why are you pushing me?

53:55.000 --> 53:56.880
I think we got them.

53:56.880 --> 53:59.680
You think? Yeah, we got them.
It's okay. I feel good now.

53:59.680 --> 54:01.120
They're back on our side.

55:20.440 --> 55:22.680
I really wanted it
before I started to dress.

55:22.680 --> 55:25.360
I do hope that it's good and hot.
Nobody's complained yet.

55:25.360 --> 55:26.600
Oh, dear me!

55:26.600 --> 55:28.640
I say, I thought you were
the man with my tea.

55:28.640 --> 55:31.720
Well, what were you going to do
if it was cold? Cut off his head?

55:32.800 --> 55:37.320
Oh, you mean Excalibur.
Old family heirloom.

55:37.320 --> 55:40.480
Mother Harcourt wants me
to wear it for the wedding.

55:40.480 --> 55:42.040
You know, it's odd,

55:42.040 --> 55:44.840
but the old dear's as taken
with things English

55:44.840 --> 55:46.960
as I am with things American.

55:46.960 --> 55:48.520
Well, I'm glad you feel that way,

55:48.520 --> 55:53.480
because this American certainly
feels gaga about you.

55:53.480 --> 55:57.320
Gaga? I'm not sure I follow.

55:57.320 --> 55:59.480
Does this make it any clearer?

55:59.480 --> 56:00.840
Oh, marvellous.

56:02.600 --> 56:08.280
"To feel gaga about a person
means to rub his neck."

56:08.280 --> 56:12.400
No, you don't understand.
I mean, you do things to me.

56:12.400 --> 56:14.080
Do things to you?

56:14.080 --> 56:16.880
I mean, you send me...
Send you where?

56:16.880 --> 56:19.400
One look at you and I get hot pants.

56:19.400 --> 56:22.000
Oh, dear me.
Would a bit of ice do any good?

56:22.000 --> 56:24.560
Evie, "hot pants" means
that I'm crazy about you.

56:25.920 --> 56:29.560
"Hot pants means
that you're crazy about me."

56:31.400 --> 56:32.720
Oh, smashing.

56:32.720 --> 56:36.000
Because I think you're
the absolute rat's pyjamas. Ha!

56:37.360 --> 56:39.720
Oh. Oh, I say, um...

56:41.720 --> 56:43.640
Is something funny?

56:43.640 --> 56:47.280
Yeah, but it's also kind of cute.
OK, what's going on in here?!

56:47.280 --> 56:48.400
Aha!

56:48.400 --> 56:51.480
So, this is what I find, huh?
Oh, you beast.

56:51.480 --> 56:55.040
You animal,
you despoiling of innocent girlhood.

56:55.040 --> 56:56.640
Look at this poor child.
Look at her.

56:56.640 --> 57:00.240
Her clothes torn off
by your fiendish attack.

57:00.240 --> 57:02.120
Standing there in all her nakedness.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.640
There's something wrong here.

57:06.640 --> 57:09.120
There's nothing wrong here.
Just hold on a minute, Moonface.

57:09.120 --> 57:11.760
No, do you think your girlfriend's
going to marry you after this?

57:11.760 --> 57:14.800
And don't think she won't know,
because I am going to tell her.

57:14.800 --> 57:15.920
Oh, do, do.

57:15.920 --> 57:18.880
Only make it a bit thicker, she does
complain that I lack fervour.

57:18.880 --> 57:21.080
Hang on, buster,
you've got the wrong attitude here.

57:21.080 --> 57:24.640
You're talking to a very dangerous
man. Oh, go on, Padre.

57:24.640 --> 57:26.920
You're an old sweetheart,
and you know it!

57:26.920 --> 57:29.920
OK, I'm going to prove to you
how dangerous I am, OK?

57:29.920 --> 57:31.400
I'll show you.

57:31.400 --> 57:32.760
Yeah.

57:36.040 --> 57:38.240
Do you mind waiting here?
I won't be long.

57:40.960 --> 57:44.400
You know, I have noticed that these
clergy sometimes go a bit off.

57:44.400 --> 57:47.080
Oh, Evie, there's something
I've got to tell you.

57:47.080 --> 57:49.040
This was a set-up.

57:49.040 --> 57:51.840
A set-up?
We were going to frame you.

57:51.840 --> 57:56.040
Frame me? He was supposed to bust in
and catch us in a...

57:57.240 --> 57:58.360
Clinch!

57:59.920 --> 58:01.240
Oh, I say.

58:02.320 --> 58:05.800
You mean, he thought
I was going to make love to you?

58:05.800 --> 58:07.320
That was the idea.

58:09.160 --> 58:11.280
Oh, that is exciting!

58:12.920 --> 58:16.160
You mean to say that he thought
that you and...? OK, right!

58:16.160 --> 58:18.760
Does this prove how serious this is?
Moon, are you nuts?

58:18.760 --> 58:20.440
Put that thing down. No.
Put it down!

58:20.440 --> 58:22.160
No! Down! Ooh!

58:22.160 --> 58:24.120
It's all right, Padre.

58:24.120 --> 58:26.560
You thought that I'd take advantage
of Miss Sweeney here,

58:26.560 --> 58:28.040
and you came to her rescue.

58:28.040 --> 58:32.200
And I admire you for it.
I really admire you enormously.

58:32.200 --> 58:33.920
Ooh, what's the expression?

58:33.920 --> 58:35.040
Oh!

58:35.040 --> 58:37.440
I've got hot pants for you!

58:39.000 --> 58:41.040
You come any closer and I'll shoot!

58:57.600 --> 58:59.360
I'm so sorry!

59:01.760 --> 59:05.360
Evening, folks! I trust
you're enjoying the crossing.

59:05.360 --> 59:08.440
This is the dullest passenger list
I've ever seen.

59:08.440 --> 59:12.280
There's nobody on board
but nobodies. No celebrities.

59:12.280 --> 59:17.120
I want celebrities!
Oh, well, um, how about...

59:17.120 --> 59:20.360
..Gertrude Ederle?
The Channel swimmer?

59:20.360 --> 59:23.920
Is she onboard?
Not exactly, but there she goes.

59:25.080 --> 59:27.560
Well, I never!
What does he take us for?

59:27.560 --> 59:29.560
It's like crossing on a tug boat.

59:29.560 --> 59:31.720
Next time, I'm booking with Cunard.

59:32.920 --> 59:34.520
What does Hope see in that guy?

59:34.520 --> 59:36.240
Hey, it must be her mother.

59:36.240 --> 59:39.680
Yeah. She's the one behind all this.
Hey, I could shoot the mother.

59:39.680 --> 59:41.800
Moon! No, OK, I got another plan.

59:41.800 --> 59:44.120
Yeah, well, I hope it's better
than the last one.

59:44.120 --> 59:47.840
Any sign of that criminal yet, men?
Not yet, sir.

59:47.840 --> 59:51.400
Apprehend that man immediately.
Aye, aye, sir.

59:51.400 --> 59:56.360
And if you see any celebrities,
apprehend them too. Yes, sir.

59:56.360 --> 59:58.640
Hey, did you hear that?

59:58.640 --> 1:00:01.000
I gotta do something about
this disguise. Whoa!

1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:02.760
Stay out of the kitchen

1:00:02.760 --> 1:00:04.840
or I'll put you on the menu.

1:00:04.840 --> 1:00:07.240
Sailor, find out who this
belongs to.

1:00:07.240 --> 1:00:08.680
Aye-aye, sir.

1:00:08.680 --> 1:00:11.680
Now, if only I had a beard
or a phoney moustache.

1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:22.560
Whoo!

1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:30.160
Cheeky! Oh...

1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:32.000
Where is that dog?

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.960
Now, now. They always find their way
home.

1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:38.720
His home is in Oyster Bay,
Long Island.

1:00:38.720 --> 1:00:40.680
Be calm, my dear.

1:00:40.680 --> 1:00:43.080
Oh, you're a trembling fawn.

1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:44.840
Here, have a snort.

1:00:44.840 --> 1:00:48.720
I told you, Eli, liquor has never
touched my lips.

1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:51.720
You know a shortcut?

1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:57.520
Cheeky! Come here, doggie.

1:00:57.520 --> 1:00:59.160
Cheeky! Oh, Evangeline.

1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:01.400
Just look at the moon, huh?

1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:05.960
This night was made for romance,
my sweet.

1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:12.080
Will you marry me?

1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:20.120
I'm afraid I can't, sir.
I'm already married. What?

1:01:20.120 --> 1:01:23.560
But there is a lady round the corner
looking for a dog...

1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:26.200
Why don't you try her? Yeah. Um...
Thank you.

1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:27.880
You're welcome.

1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:36.640
How does it feel...? Cheeky!

1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:40.720
Quick, get rid of him! What do you
do with a dog?

1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:43.600
Just get rid of him.
I know, I'll put him down here.

1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:47.520
Stop. Stop, stop.

1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:52.760
Oh, where is that dog?

1:01:52.760 --> 1:01:54.040
Cheeky!

1:01:55.920 --> 1:01:57.480
Agh!

1:02:01.520 --> 1:02:03.760
Dear me. Are you all right?

1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:06.120
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine now.

1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:08.800
Oh, Captain! Captain, thank God!

1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:10.960
I need your help.

1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:13.240
What is it this time, madam?

1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:16.760
I can't find my little Cheeky.

1:02:16.760 --> 1:02:19.840
Why, it's right beside
your little nosy!

1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:26.520
Ohh!

1:02:26.520 --> 1:02:28.440
How could you do that?

1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:30.600
Oh, relax. Dogs are good swimmers.

1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:32.280
This way, men!

1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:36.360
We'll check the library, then
the ballroom.

1:02:36.360 --> 1:02:39.080
He's got to be on board somewhere.

1:02:39.080 --> 1:02:41.280
Ka-ta! Ka-ta!

1:02:52.760 --> 1:02:55.280
Are you sure this is going to work?

1:02:55.280 --> 1:02:58.720
Look, come on. Do you want me to
take care of the mother or not?

1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:00.120
Here she is.

1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:02.600
Excuse me, miss.

1:03:02.600 --> 1:03:05.200
We're from old London town.

1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:10.120
And we're looking for Lord Evelyn
Oakleigh. Do you know him?

1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:12.880
I should say so.
He's going to marry my daughter.

1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:14.280
Oh, no!

1:03:14.280 --> 1:03:15.720
Is something wrong?

1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:17.440
Allow me to introduce myself.

1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:19.480
I am Lord Evelyn Oakleigh.

1:03:19.480 --> 1:03:22.400
The man you think you know as
Lord Evelyn Oakleigh

1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:24.520
is, in reality, my brother.

1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:26.440
Edna. Edna.

1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:29.400
Your brother Edna? That's right.

1:03:29.400 --> 1:03:32.640
His real name's Mona, but he
changed it, you see,

1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:35.040
cos he's a bit deranged, you know?

1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:38.440
Several months ago, he escaped from
the family suite at Bedlam.

1:03:38.440 --> 1:03:41.000
You have a family suite at Bedlam?
That's right.

1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:44.200
I was driving him down to Savile
Row for his new straitjacket

1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:47.880
and suddenly, blinky-blonky, didn't
half give me the slip, he did.

1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:50.440
Who is this man?

1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:52.600
Oh! My brother's keeper.
Oh, dear me.

1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:54.800
Oh, this is most upsetting.

1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:57.720
It's all right. Don't worry.
We know how to handle him.

1:03:57.720 --> 1:04:00.320
Oh, yes. We have been through this
a million times.

1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:02.080
You mean this has happened before?

1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:03.640
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:07.160
He marries 'em, murders 'em,
marries 'em and murders 'em. Ohh!

1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:09.120
Murders their mothers.

1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:10.680
Ohh!

1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:14.480
But he seemed so normal. No... They
all say that!

1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:17.160
She doesn't know the signs.
The telltale signs.

1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:19.880
The fatal signs. The fatal signs.
What signs?

1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:22.480
There's a certain phrase he uses.
Just before he snaps.

1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:25.480
Have you ever heard him say...?
- What-ho!
- That's it!

1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:28.960
Edna... Ssh! I mean, Evelyn!

1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:31.040
I've been looking everywhere for
you, Mums.

1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:33.000
I say, how do you like it?

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:34.840
Agh! Jesus Christ!

1:04:34.840 --> 1:04:37.800
Dear me, is she all right? She's all
right. She's just playing dead.

1:04:37.800 --> 1:04:41.280
Oh, my God, Mother!
Mother! Billy, what have you done?

1:04:41.280 --> 1:04:42.880
Hope, I can explain everything.

1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:45.360
You just don't know when to stop,
do you, Billy?

1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:47.720
His name isn't Billy, dear.
It's Evelyn.

1:04:47.720 --> 1:04:49.440
And Evelyn isn't Evelyn.

1:04:49.440 --> 1:04:51.000
He's Edna.

1:04:52.560 --> 1:04:55.720
And Edna's really Mona. I'll show
you who he is!

1:04:55.720 --> 1:04:58.920
It's him!
Hey, he's getting away!

1:04:58.920 --> 1:05:00.240
Come on, after him!

1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:03.200
Evelyn, will you please take
Mrs Harcourt back to her cabin?

1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:06.600
Right-ho. Oh, dear me. What else
can go wrong?

1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:08.320

this ridiculous act?

1:05:16.280 --> 1:05:18.760
I beg your pardon? You're in love
with him.

1:05:18.760 --> 1:05:21.480
Why don't you just admit it? I
really don't think that this is...

1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:24.320
He may want you now, but he's not
going to stick around for ever.

1:05:24.320 --> 1:05:26.400
Half the women in New York are crazy
about him.

1:05:26.400 --> 1:05:29.160
Why, just the other night, one of
the best-looking dames I know

1:05:29.160 --> 1:05:32.000
practically proposed to him.
She did? Well, who was she?

1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:33.360
Me.

1:05:51.480 --> 1:05:53.680
Oh, I'm sorry. Forgive me.

1:05:53.680 --> 1:05:55.080

I said,
I just can't help it!

1:05:59.920 --> 1:06:03.640
Oh, if only I'd have told him how
I really feel...

1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:05.080
How's that?

1:06:06.360 --> 1:06:08.640

and you wonder if it's all worth it.

1:25:58.040 --> 1:26:00.560
Then something like this happens.

1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:02.200
You're beautiful!

1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:04.640
Let's go, girls,
we've got a show to do.

1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:08.240
So, how do you like the
royal treatment, Snake Eyes?

1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:09.840
Nice!

1:26:13.840 --> 1:26:17.040
Listen, kid, I just saw Hope.
She's all broken up. Aw!

1:26:20.480 --> 1:26:23.560
Oh, tough guy, huh? Suppose I told
you she wants to marry you.

1:26:23.560 --> 1:26:25.440
You're kidding me. She said that?
No.

1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:30.800

nuts about you.

1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:33.840

Hey, showtime, toots!

1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:46.520
I would appreciate if you would
cease addressing me as "toots",

1:26:46.520 --> 1:26:49.360
and henceforth call me by
my right name -

1:26:49.360 --> 1:26:52.080
Mrs Moonface Martin!

1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:53.480
Yeah.

Let me guess - you performed the
ceremony yourself?

1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:06.600
Oh, God, it's not legal, is it?

1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:12.320
Miss Sweeney's service will
do you good, Eli.

1:27:12.320 --> 1:27:15.400
You need to reform your ways.

1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:17.680
What's the matter with my ways?

1:27:17.680 --> 1:27:20.400
You proposed to a sailor!

1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:23.600
I'm a lonely man, Evangeline.

1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:26.840
Hey, Dudley, get a load of this.

1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:28.920
My dear,

1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:32.400
may I say you look like
a million bucks!

1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:34.560
Thanks, fellas. I'm touched.

1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:36.040
Wah!

1:27:36.040 --> 1:27:37.880
That's an expression.

1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:41.040
Evelyn, I really don't feel
up to this.

1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:42.600
I want to go back to my cabin.

1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:44.120
Don't be silly, darling.

1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:45.800
Look, it's Snake Ears!

1:27:45.800 --> 1:27:47.360
Evelyn, no! I say!

1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:49.120

1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:00.960
Oh, damn. Evelyn, stop it.

1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:03.040
Hey, you want to make her happy,
pal?

1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:04.720
Do an imitation of me.

1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:06.520
You can be very cruel.

1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:08.400
That's how he got to be Number One.

1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:10.040
Hope, wait. Come on.

1:28:10.040 --> 1:28:13.560
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1:28:13.560 --> 1:28:17.160
the SS American is pleased
to present

1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:20.080
the world's most sensuous
sermoniser,

1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:22.520
Her High—Stepping Holiness,

1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:24.800
Miss Reno Sweeney!

1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:35.240
Hush!

1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:38.760
Brothers and sisters, we are here
tonight to fight the Devil.

1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:42.520
There's only one way to fight
the Devil,

1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:44.280
and that's in the open.

1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:47.280
I want each of you to turn to his
neighbour and say,

1:28:47.280 --> 1:28:49.640
"Bless you, brother.
Bless you, sister."

1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:51.880
Bless you, brother.
Bless you, sister.

1:28:51.880 --> 1:28:54.280
There's only one way to send the
Devil packing

1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:55.920
and that's to confess your sins.

1:28:55.920 --> 1:28:59.440
Who will be the first to speak out
and say, "I'm a sinner"?

1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:01.040
I'm a sinner!

1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:03.960
Hallelujah! Thank you, sister.
Who's next?

1:29:03.960 --> 1:29:05.640
I'm a sinner.

1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:07.760
Hallelujah! Who's next?

1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:09.960
Go ahead, Eli.

1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:14.920
Ahem. Well...

1:29:14.920 --> 1:29:16.920
..there was a time when I drank.

1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:19.760
Yeah? What time was that?
Half an hour ago?

1:29:19.760 --> 1:29:21.400
Hallelujah!

1:29:21.400 --> 1:29:23.600
I'm cursed with sex appeal!

1:29:23.600 --> 1:29:25.520
It's been my downfall.

1:29:25.520 --> 1:29:29.040
She's not confessing.
She is advertising.

1:29:29.040 --> 1:29:30.840
Hallelujah!

1:29:30.840 --> 1:29:34.040
Come on, get busy. Who will give us
a real confession?

1:29:34.040 --> 1:29:35.720
Um... I say,

1:29:35.720 --> 1:29:37.160
may I have a go?

1:29:37.160 --> 1:29:40.400
Speak up, brother,
I want to hear this.

1:29:40.400 --> 1:29:41.960
Um...

1:29:41.960 --> 1:29:45.000
While I was visiting Singapore
some time ago,

1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:47.120
there was a girl named Plum Blossom

1:29:47.120 --> 1:29:49.000
of whom I became extremely fond.

1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:51.480
Eventually, we made a bit of
unpremeditated whoopee

1:29:51.480 --> 1:29:53.080
in the willows...

1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:56.200
..and I enjoyed it very much.

1:30:03.080 --> 1:30:06.840
I was worried about you, brother,
but I feel much better now!

1:30:06.840 --> 1:30:08.600
Hallelujah!

and I...

1:39:10.520 --> 1:39:12.640

1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:14.560
How did I show it?

I'll never bother you again.

1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:33.320
What's going on? He doesn't sound
like Snake Eyes Johnson. I'm not.

1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:37.040
I'm not a gangster. I'm just a
broken-down broker.

1:39:37.040 --> 1:39:40.040
Then he's a phoney!
I want my money back.

1:39:40.040 --> 1:39:41.920
They ought to give him the chair.

1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:44.200
Purser, clap that man in irons!
Yeah!

1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:46.600
Get behind me, kid.
We'll shoot our way out.

1:39:54.480 --> 1:39:57.480
There's something
definitely wrong here.

1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:02.480
Captain?

1:40:02.480 --> 1:40:04.000
Yes, madam?

1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.720
Captain, is it true that you have
the authority

1:40:06.720 --> 1:40:10.080
to perform weddings on board
this vessel?

2:00:38.800 --> 2:00:40.960

2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:43.680
What about us? When are we getting
out? I know this would happen!

2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:47.800

I don't know. I lost the little
hand.

2:00:59.880 --> 2:01:02.760
The wedding starts at 9.30. We gotta
get out of here.

2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:05.400
Hey, you bums! Reno! Boys, I've got
fabulous news,

2:01:05.400 --> 2:01:08.640
the greatest thing that can happen
to a person just happened to me!

2:01:08.640 --> 2:01:11.400
You got parole? No, she's in love!

2:01:11.400 --> 2:01:14.960
And what's more, Evelyn is in love
with me.

2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:16.440
What? That's great.

2:01:16.440 --> 2:01:19.880
In fact, it's perfect. Yeah. That's
right, cos Reno gets to marry

2:01:19.880 --> 2:01:22.200
Evelyn, and Billy gets to marry
Hope!

2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:24.600
That only leaves one little problem.
What's that?

2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:26.360
How do I put this? Let me out!

2:01:26.360 --> 2:01:28.800
Reno, we've got to think of
something.

2:01:28.800 --> 2:01:32.400
Yeah, if only we were them. Them?
Yeah, they get out in an hour.

2:01:35.400 --> 2:01:37.000
Hey, guys!

2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:39.800
That's a couple of fancy outfits
you're wearing there.

2:01:39.800 --> 2:01:41.480
Thanks, old buddy.

2:01:41.480 --> 2:01:44.360
I have to say, I like the look of
your duds too.

2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:46.680
Yeah? You wouldn't fancy
a little swap?

2:01:46.680 --> 2:01:50.040

We are assembled here to join
together

2:07:52.600 --> 2:07:55.640

this young man...

2:07:55.640 --> 2:07:59.960
Cease and desist!

2:07:59.960 --> 2:08:01.760
Good Lord, what is this?

2:08:01.760 --> 2:08:03.480
My colleague and I are barristers

2:08:03.480 --> 2:08:05.840
from the firm of
Treacle, Treacle & Custard,

2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:08.480
with offices in New York, London and
Singapore.

2:08:08.480 --> 2:08:11.800
We demand a hearing on behalf of our
distinguished clients.

2:08:11.800 --> 2:08:13.560
Distinguished clients?

2:08:13.560 --> 2:08:15.960
Permit me to explain.

2:08:15.960 --> 2:08:19.960
My clients have just come completed
an extensive peregrination

2:08:19.960 --> 2:08:21.960
in order to confirm most urgently

2:08:21.960 --> 2:08:23.760
with this English gentleman.

2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:27.840
It appears we have arrived in, as it
were, the nick of time!

2:08:27.840 --> 2:08:30.920
I'm afraid if you've come in
reference to my Hong Kong interests,

2:08:30.920 --> 2:08:33.440
you've chosen a bad moment. I'm
about to be married.

2:08:33.440 --> 2:08:35.800
The marriage is impossible.
Impossible?

2:08:35.800 --> 2:08:37.600
What on earth do you mean?

2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:42.920
Allow me to introduce the mortified
father of little Plum Blossom.

2:08:45.040 --> 2:08:48.600
And who is little Plum Blossom?

2:08:48.600 --> 2:08:50.680
Yes, who is little Plum Blossom?

2:08:50.680 --> 2:08:52.960
This is little Plum Blossom.

2:09:04.440 --> 2:09:06.920
I'm not sure I follow this.

2:09:06.920 --> 2:09:10.520
Lord Evelyn took Plum Blossom to a
willow grove

2:09:10.520 --> 2:09:13.040
and returned with a Plum tart.

2:09:14.640 --> 2:09:17.760
Dear me! Is this really true?

2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:24.480
I'm afraid so. Evelyn, is this woman
really... Plum tart Blossom?

2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:26.960
I can't really say.

2:09:26.960 --> 2:09:28.880
It all happened so long ago.

2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:30.560
Oh, good Lord!

2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:35.280
Apologies to one and all.
But under the circumstances,

2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:38.240
I don't see how I can possibly marry
Miss Harcourt.

2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:41.560
Don't be ridiculous. All these
people want is money.

2:09:41.560 --> 2:09:43.720
I'll give you $1,000 to clear out.

2:09:43.720 --> 2:09:45.920
We'll take it. Do not insult our
clients

2:09:45.920 --> 2:09:47.600
with an offer of filthy money!

2:09:47.600 --> 2:09:50.480
I'll make it $2,000! You cannot buy
the honour.

2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:52.400
I'll make it $5,000!

2:09:52.400 --> 2:09:54.240
Yeah, yeah, honour sold.

2:09:54.240 --> 2:09:55.960
No, Mr Whitney, don't pay him.

2:09:55.960 --> 2:09:58.720
No amount of money can undo this
great wrong.

2:09:58.720 --> 2:10:02.600
You, sir, you are related to little
Plum Blossom?

2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:05.000
Like an O'Neill drama to
Whistler's mom.

2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:07.840
Then the only way to repay this
debt of honour, Evelyn,

2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:10.120
is for you to offer him...me!

2:10:10.120 --> 2:10:11.680
No!

2:10:11.680 --> 2:10:14.200
Oh, I say! What a marvellous idea!

2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:17.320
Offer accepted! Congratulations,
old boy.

2:10:17.320 --> 2:10:20.160
You're getting quite a girl.
What about the five grand?

2:10:20.160 --> 2:10:22.800
Say, why does the English gentleman
not join the club

2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:25.200
and right the wrong done to poor
Plum Blossom?

2:10:25.200 --> 2:10:27.720
Right the wrong done to poor
Plum...? Oh, I say.

2:10:29.800 --> 2:10:31.800
Well, confound it, why not?

2:10:31.800 --> 2:10:33.600
Now, look here,

2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:35.560
Plum Blossom.

2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:39.640
Will you marry me?

2:10:39.640 --> 2:10:42.760
Oh, sweetie, I thought you'd
never ask!

2:10:42.760 --> 2:10:44.560
Why, Mother, what's the matter?

2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:46.240
What's the matter?

2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:48.160
We're poor again!

2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:51.880
I shall have to spend
the rest of my life

2:10:51.880 --> 2:10:55.120
living in hotels...

2:10:56.040 --> 2:10:58.120
Like hell you will!

2:10:58.120 --> 2:11:00.400
Marry me, Evangeline!

2:11:00.400 --> 2:11:03.760
Say yes, and spend the rest of your
life in the lap of luxury.

2:11:03.760 --> 2:11:05.520
Why, after that amalgamated deal,

2:11:05.520 --> 2:11:08.640
I'm so damn rich I could buy
this tub

2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:10.760

for you.

2:11:20.080 --> 2:11:22.080
Oh, thank you, Crocker.

2:11:22.080 --> 2:11:24.160

2:11:24.160 --> 2:11:25.920
How the hell did you get on board?

2:11:25.920 --> 2:11:27.680
I have a confession to make.

2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:30.000
I never made it to the Stock
Exchange.

2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:32.000
I stowed away aboard this ship.

2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:35.160
I never sold those amalgamated
shares.

2:11:35.160 --> 2:11:38.160
You never sold the shares?
You never sold the shares?!

2:11:38.160 --> 2:11:40.480
