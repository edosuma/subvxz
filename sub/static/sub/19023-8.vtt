00:01.376 --> 00:04.086
<i>One of the best things
about friendship with Turk</i>

00:04.171 --> 00:06.632
<i>is challenging each other
to try new things.</i>

00:06.715 --> 00:09.218
l can't believe we're
going to a strip club.

00:09.301 --> 00:12.471
l don't think about it that way.
lt's a place to buy a burger

00:12.554 --> 00:15.807
that's a two-and-a-half mile
walk away from the hospital.

00:15.891 --> 00:18.227
No skin! We all win!

00:18.310 --> 00:21.063
Let's get outta here
before we end up on the news.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.315
Are you gentlemen
visiting the club?

00:23.398 --> 00:25.984
No, we're protesting.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.986
l'm worried about the kids.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.239
So what's that in your pocket?

00:30.322 --> 00:33.200
This is... lt's $38 in singles.

00:33.283 --> 00:36.578
l bought a newspaper
and this is the change from my 40.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.748
Neil...

00:40.791 --> 00:42.292
Sir...

00:43.168 --> 00:45.546
- No pulse.
- Starting CPR.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.590
Call an ambulance!

00:49.633 --> 00:54.221
Coming to you live as two young doctors
are trying to resuscitate my cameraman.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.183
Well, maybe l'm biased, but to me,

00:58.267 --> 01:01.395
every doctor here at Sacred Heart
is a hero.

01:01.478 --> 01:04.397
Does that mean l'm a hero? l don't know.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.651
There's my dynamic duo!

01:07.734 --> 01:10.112
Dr Dorian! Dr Turk!

01:10.195 --> 01:12.364
Holy inferiority complex, Batman!

01:12.447 --> 01:15.993
How low is my self-esteem that
l'm the sidekick in my own fantasy?

01:16.076 --> 01:19.246
lt could be worse, Robin.
You could be Alfred the butler.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.415
Damn you, sir.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.586
<i>Life in a hospital moves fast.
One second you're a hero,</i>

01:25.669 --> 01:28.463
<i>the next you're obsessing
about evaluations.</i>

01:28.547 --> 01:31.800
- Who cares? lt's only a grade.
- Really? What did you get?

01:31.884 --> 01:36.221
A-plus. l turned on the waterworks and
the resident changed it to A-plus-plus.

01:36.305 --> 01:39.808
- A proud day for women everywhere.
- Why are you worried?

01:39.892 --> 01:43.687
With the hero thing, whoever
evaluates you will give you a gold star.

01:43.770 --> 01:47.232
Listen, Supergirl. l'm gonna
break you into so many pieces

01:47.316 --> 01:51.862
that my grandmother, who can do
a 1 ,000-piece puzzle in an hour,

01:51.945 --> 01:54.406
will never be able
to put you back together,

01:54.489 --> 01:57.868
even if she goes go back in time
to when her vision was perfect.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.495
Somehow l doubt it.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:16.678 --> 02:20.432
Before you deny you like looking
at strange naked women again,

02:20.516 --> 02:24.561
l should remind you that when you stay
at my place, it's not a hotel.

02:24.645 --> 02:28.148
The movie titles do come up on the bill.

02:28.232 --> 02:30.776
l'm sticking with ''we were protesting.''
JD?

02:30.859 --> 02:33.695
Outraged and disgusted.

02:33.779 --> 02:38.200
Take Bambi out tonight. Maybe
with the hype you can get him a girl.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.331
Who hasn't bought us drinks yet?

02:46.208 --> 02:49.044
lt could happen.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.340
- Don't wait up for me tonight.
- OK.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.801
Do you wanna get drunk
and beg me for sex now

02:55.884 --> 02:58.345
or wait till two o'clock tonight?

02:58.428 --> 03:00.848
- Let's wait.
- Cool.

03:00.931 --> 03:05.018
You know, l'm off tonight.
What are you doing, Carla?

03:05.102 --> 03:08.105
Just having dinner
with a friend.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.316
<i>Man, this is so uncomfortable.</i>

03:11.400 --> 03:13.902
<i>She's not gonna get the invite.</i>

03:13.986 --> 03:16.280
<i>Just hold your breath until it's over.</i>

03:16.363 --> 03:18.824
You could take Elliot with you.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.833
Great. l can't wait.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.003
Have a good time tonight.

03:33.505 --> 03:34.756
Lose something?

03:34.840 --> 03:37.259
No, why? Did you take something?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.679
- No.
- What'd you take?

03:40.762 --> 03:42.472
Nothing.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.391
What'd you take?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.685
Newbie. Come.

03:46.768 --> 03:50.355
<i>Now I think about it, I'm psyched
to have Dr Cox do my evaluation.</i>

03:50.439 --> 03:53.108
<i>It'll be a chance to see
what he thinks of me.</i>

03:53.192 --> 03:56.737
Look, Doogie,
l'm up to my cha-chas in busywork,

03:56.820 --> 04:00.115
so l'm gonna take a rain check
on your report card

04:00.199 --> 04:02.284
and have you do it yourself.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.538
You didn't even fill out my name.

04:06.622 --> 04:10.792
Well, now, l think it's John,
or Jimmy or Ji or hmm.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.253
lt's in the J family.

04:13.337 --> 04:16.632
But if you get in trouble,
just ask the nurses for help.

04:19.134 --> 04:22.346
Sir, l've been the hospital's
legal counsel for,

04:22.429 --> 04:26.850
well, let's just say,
when l started, l had hair.

04:26.934 --> 04:30.437
And a wife and family.

04:30.521 --> 04:33.065
The point is, l'll never get a raise

04:33.148 --> 04:35.984
without support
of senior staff like yourself.

04:36.068 --> 04:40.739
- Can't do it.
- Well, you did what you could.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.699
Dr Dorian, how are you?

04:42.783 --> 04:46.078
- These evaluations...
- Just a pleasantry, keep it moving.

04:46.161 --> 04:50.916
Listen, all the publicity you
and your friend have been getting,

04:50.999 --> 04:53.585
it would be silly
not to milk it a little bit.

04:53.669 --> 04:57.297
See if we can't promote the hospital,
what do you say?

05:00.634 --> 05:03.345
OK, whose breasts
haven't l signed yet?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.473
- lt could happen.
- Excuse me?

05:06.557 --> 05:08.267
Anything for the hospital.

05:09.268 --> 05:12.813
- So what are we doing tonight?
- Go out to dinner, l guess.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.690
Dinner! Where are we gonna eat?

05:14.773 --> 05:19.027
- Don't know, some restaurant.
- Some restaurant!

05:19.111 --> 05:23.448
Be honest...
Does this look hip enough?

05:23.532 --> 05:27.035
Since when are khakis, a pink shirt
and a neckerchief not hip?

05:27.119 --> 05:28.203
True.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.916
- Hi.
- Hey, Darryl.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.755
l have to make a quick call.
So, Patricia, Darryl, this is Elliot.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.008
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.218
- l'm gonna get out of here.
- OK.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.387
Thanks for the ride.

05:45.470 --> 05:49.016
- Someone's a cradle-robber.
- Darryl's my son.

05:49.099 --> 05:53.020
The only way he could be your son
was if you had him when you were 1 5.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.771
1 4.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.441
l was close.

05:57.524 --> 06:01.904
l'm sorry, that was my mom.
l'm gonna have to cancel.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.822
<i>I can't evaluate myself.</i>

06:03.906 --> 06:07.576
Would you describe me
as warm, professional, or both?

06:07.659 --> 06:10.245
l'd describe you as ''l'm on my lunch.''

06:10.329 --> 06:13.373
l don't know whether to
be easy or hard on myself...

06:13.457 --> 06:16.877
Can't you see l'm watching my stories?

06:16.960 --> 06:21.590
<i>I can't, honey,
Parker wants me to assist.</i>

06:21.673 --> 06:24.384
Dr Cox. Have you been here
the whole time?

06:24.468 --> 06:28.597
No, l just came in
through the couch door. Move.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.183
You said you were too busy
to do my evaluation.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.060
l am.

06:33.143 --> 06:36.313
Didn't her daddy sell the coalmine?

06:36.396 --> 06:40.484
- Contract didn't stick.
- That's interesting.

06:42.611 --> 06:47.533
We're almost ready. Anything you
wanna say before we get started?

06:47.616 --> 06:50.577
Yeah, l've got something to say
to Dr Cox.

06:50.661 --> 06:55.541
l'm gonna give you the best damn
evaluation that you ever did see.

06:55.624 --> 07:00.003
And this Friday,
at the Steel Cage Medi-Slam,

07:00.087 --> 07:04.591
l'm gonna give you a physical
you ain't never gonna forget.

07:04.675 --> 07:08.804
l'm gonna probe ya,
cos l'm The lntern.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.225
Nothing. OK, l'll be right back.

07:13.308 --> 07:18.522
She is tasty. Watch me work
a cat and mouse game with her.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.357
She's married to the soundman.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.611
That thing clipped to your collar,
that's a microphone.

07:24.695 --> 07:28.824
l'm so sorry.
And l love ZZ Top.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.703
l'm not looking forward to this.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.123
OK, we're rolling.
So, how's my cameraman doing?

07:36.248 --> 07:40.127
Good enough that he asked me
for mouth-to-mouth again.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.714
Dr Turk, are there
any specific challenges

07:43.797 --> 07:46.925
being a young black doctor
in an inner city hospital?

07:50.053 --> 07:53.807
l wanna hear this.
ls it possible to turn up the volume?

07:53.891 --> 07:56.560
That's as high as it goes.

08:07.112 --> 08:10.866
Listen, let me tell you what happened.

08:17.581 --> 08:18.874
Damn.

08:18.957 --> 08:23.712
When l saw that it was missing,
did you not think l'd come to you?

08:23.795 --> 08:26.798
l don't know what you're talking about.

08:26.882 --> 08:30.260
So you're gonna play it that way, huh?

08:30.344 --> 08:32.596
TouchÃ©.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.479
- l finished my evaluation.
- Great.

08:40.562 --> 08:45.025
l thought it would take longer so the
marching band won't be here until later.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.903
Enjoy. l think you'll find
it's a good read.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.614
Hey, Newbie.
This thing actually does matter,

08:50.697 --> 08:53.325
so were you completely honest
with yourself?

08:53.408 --> 08:54.868
Yeah.

08:56.119 --> 08:59.039
Say it right into the camera, hotshot.

09:00.666 --> 09:04.211
Now you can have this thing back
any time you want.

09:04.294 --> 09:07.297
You're gonna have to
bark like a dog, though.

09:08.423 --> 09:11.051
l'm not gonna bark like...

09:11.134 --> 09:13.387
lt's your call.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.055
Woof.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.307
Good boy.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.769
<i>At the very least, I'm gonna end today
on a good note.</i>

09:20.853 --> 09:22.688
l got something to show you.

09:22.771 --> 09:26.233
ls this an uncomfortable moment
that'll change our friendship?

09:26.316 --> 09:28.360
No, no. You're going to like it.

09:28.443 --> 09:31.363
Good, cos l need some good news,
man.

09:31.446 --> 09:35.534
Can you believe that news lady?
''What's it like to be a black doctor?''

09:35.617 --> 09:38.745
l just wish this was over.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.333
Why have we stopped?

10:07.441 --> 10:09.818
Roll 'em up

10:22.122 --> 10:24.416
Why do you think
l wanna be a part of this?

10:24.500 --> 10:28.086
Kelso said it would make us
role models. l just assumed...

10:28.170 --> 10:30.756
Everybody assumes
that l'm a good athlete,

10:30.839 --> 10:33.842
<i>or that l grew up poor,
or that l love Sanford and Son.</i>

10:33.926 --> 10:36.553
<i>But you do love Sanford And Son.</i>

10:37.471 --> 10:39.431
We both do.

10:49.066 --> 10:52.611
That's what l'm talking about.

11:09.503 --> 11:12.756
lf Dr Kelso wants me to be
a role model for the community

11:12.840 --> 11:16.635
because l'm a great doctor, great.
l will sign on the dotted line.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.054
But that's not what this is about.

11:19.137 --> 11:22.474
All my life l've been
singled out because l'm black.

11:23.392 --> 11:27.187
- l didn't enter the contest!
- Smile for the picture.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.693
- Remember our college brochure?
- They put you on the cover.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.111
Twice?

11:35.988 --> 11:39.700
lt's different this time,
now it's both of us.

11:55.007 --> 11:57.509
You can still see
my hand on your shoulder.

11:57.593 --> 12:01.847
<i>That's when I realised, I'm not gonna
let people take advantage of me.</i>

12:01.930 --> 12:04.933
This is unfair.
You're supposed to do my evaluation.

12:05.017 --> 12:08.562
And you know what?
You're gonna do it, buddy boy.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.022
Buddy boy?

12:10.105 --> 12:12.858
Why, l oughta...

12:12.941 --> 12:14.985
- l'm serious.
- Relax, Newbie.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.863
lt's just an evaluation,
it should be easy.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.699
lf it's that easy,
it won't take you long to do it.

12:20.782 --> 12:25.245
All right, don't worry about it, Newbie.
l'll evaluate the hell right out of you.

12:25.329 --> 12:29.291
- When?
- The second l get off work.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.542
- Fine!
- Fine.

12:30.626 --> 12:32.544
Great! Here it is.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.466
- You get off, like, six-ish, or...?
- Danger.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.435
You're gonna have to see her eventually.

12:48.519 --> 12:53.982
No. l know the layout to the air-duct
system like the back of my hand.

12:54.066 --> 12:57.319
Of course l'm gonna
have to see her again.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.988
So this is the part where
it's my fault?

13:00.072 --> 13:03.534
Turk, if you could have seen
the look on her face...

13:03.617 --> 13:07.579
lf l think about it again,
it's gonna make me cry.

13:07.663 --> 13:09.456
What am l gonna do?

13:09.540 --> 13:13.293
Keep doing what you're doing.
Eventually, she'll quit and move.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.337
- Why am l talking to you?
- What?!

13:15.420 --> 13:16.839
You're such a guy.

13:16.922 --> 13:21.385
You can't understand something this deep
on any real emotional level.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.888
l'm sorry about the poster.
lt was racially insensitive.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.266
l should've been aware of your feelings.

13:27.349 --> 13:30.727
There's never been an issue of race
between us.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.063
You've been nothing but a friend to me.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.774
- l love you, man.
- Hit me one.

13:37.568 --> 13:39.027
Keep it real.

13:39.111 --> 13:44.616
We've got some things to work out
but we'll get there.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.827
We'll get there.

13:47.786 --> 13:52.583
Sure, it hurt. But you know what?
l'm not gonna wallow in self pity.

13:52.666 --> 13:57.379
Right after work, l'm gonna go downtown
and just tear it up.

13:57.462 --> 14:00.799
Maybe l'll have a cigarette,
just get a little crazy,

14:00.883 --> 14:04.178
and head wherever the night takes me.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.973
What's that, now?

14:15.731 --> 14:17.816
Thanks so much!

14:31.955 --> 14:33.081
Taxi!

14:33.165 --> 14:35.375
Hey, baby, how much?

14:35.459 --> 14:37.836
Hey, don't go away, man!

14:37.920 --> 14:40.756
Get me the hell outta here. Hurry!

14:45.427 --> 14:47.387
Here's what we're gonna do.

14:47.471 --> 14:51.517
l'm gonna leave the cart in the closet
and leave the closet unlocked.

14:51.600 --> 14:56.813
lf, by magic, it should happen to
reappear, l won't ask any questions.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.399
l don't even know what ''it'' is.

14:59.483 --> 15:02.236
Then why take it?

15:04.446 --> 15:09.576
Well, if it isn't Dr Turk,
the friendly face of Sacred Heart.

15:09.660 --> 15:10.994
Yeah.

15:11.078 --> 15:16.166
Dr Kelso, about these posters...
They're making me uncomfortable.

15:16.250 --> 15:21.004
l'm so sorry.
l didn't realise you felt that way.

15:21.088 --> 15:25.092
Well, here's what l'm gonna do...
l'm gonna leave them up.

15:25.175 --> 15:27.678
l can live with that. Or l can sue you.

15:32.558 --> 15:38.897
Dr Turk, you are an employee here.
l can advertise however l wish.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.692
l can use your image, your name,

15:41.775 --> 15:45.279
l can manufacture
tiny little Dr Turk action figures.

15:45.362 --> 15:48.365
lt'll cost $1 2.95.
When you pull the string, it says:

15:48.448 --> 15:50.450
''l don't like these posters!''

15:50.534 --> 15:53.036
- lsn't that right, Ted?
- Definitely, sir.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.623
You'd certainly be vulnerable
from a legal standpoint.

15:56.707 --> 15:58.208
How vulnerable?

15:58.292 --> 16:02.921
That lawsuit would be over so quickly,
bring cab fare to the courthouse,

16:03.005 --> 16:07.384
since Dr Turk will be driving
your Beamer home to his place.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.762
Hippie.

16:12.306 --> 16:14.558
God, that felt good.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.102
Who's the man?

16:17.186 --> 16:19.271
- ls it me?
- Damn right it's you.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.110
Right, man.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.572
lt's me.

16:41.585 --> 16:45.297
Elliot...
There's no excuse for what l did.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.382
No, there's not.

16:49.593 --> 16:52.930
- Are we done?
- l'm really sorry.

16:53.013 --> 16:59.144
Don't be. lf l was going out
with my friend l wouldn't invite you.

16:59.228 --> 17:04.441
Yes, l would. She'd like you better and
neither of you would talk to me again.

17:04.525 --> 17:08.153
l only did it because l hadn't
seen Patricia in a long time.

17:08.237 --> 17:11.156
You did it cos l don't fit in
with you and your friend.

17:11.240 --> 17:15.868
lt's no surprise. lt's not like
l've ever fit in anywhere.

17:15.953 --> 17:20.665
Carla, your friend Patricia's here.
There's a problem with her son.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.505
Why so sad, Marshmallow?

17:28.507 --> 17:32.135
<i>Stay calm,
stay calm, stay calm.</i>

17:32.219 --> 17:34.388
<i>Oh, good. He's not here.</i>

17:35.973 --> 17:37.349
Dr Cox?

17:40.561 --> 17:42.855
lt's time. Sit down.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.944
What do you want me to say?
That you're great?

17:49.027 --> 17:52.155
That you're raising the bar
for interns everywhere?

17:52.239 --> 17:54.658
l'm cool with that.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.661
l'm not gonna say that. You're OK.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.831
You might be better than that some day
but now all l see is

18:00.914 --> 18:03.709
a guy worried about
what everybody thinks of him

18:03.792 --> 18:05.878
that he has no real belief in himself.

18:05.961 --> 18:11.925
l mean, did you even wonder why
l told you to do your own evaluation?

18:13.302 --> 18:15.679
l can't think of a safe answer,
l just...

18:15.762 --> 18:17.181
Clam up!

18:17.264 --> 18:19.975
l wanted you to think about yourself.

18:20.058 --> 18:23.020
And l mean really think.

18:23.145 --> 18:27.107
What are you good at? What do you
suck at? l wanted it down on paper,

18:27.191 --> 18:31.778
not so l could see it, or anybody else,
but so that you could see it.

18:31.862 --> 18:35.032
Ultimately, you don't have
to answer to me, or to Kelso,

18:35.115 --> 18:38.577
you don't even have to answer
to your patients, for God's sake.

18:38.660 --> 18:41.997
You only have to answer to
one guy, Newbie, and that's you!

18:46.752 --> 18:48.629
There...

18:48.712 --> 18:52.216
You are... evaluated.

18:56.053 --> 18:58.096
Get the hell outta my sight.

18:58.180 --> 19:02.684
You, honest to God, get me so angry
l'm afraid l might hurt myself.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.483
So what are you?
One of the male nurses?

19:09.566 --> 19:13.403
Actually, l'm a surgeon.
l'm doing this as a favour for Carla.

19:13.487 --> 19:17.074
Carla is fine.
What's she doing with you?

19:17.157 --> 19:19.743
Slummin' a little, God bless her heart.

19:19.827 --> 19:22.120
This is a knife cut, huh?

19:22.204 --> 19:24.164
Yeah, it's cool.

19:24.248 --> 19:29.086
See this right here?
Pinched it in a door. Two stitches.

19:29.169 --> 19:32.005
- Oh, man. You hardcore, man.
- Hell, yeah!

19:33.423 --> 19:36.218
Darryl's gonna be fine
but l'm worried about you.

19:36.301 --> 19:40.180
You're upset. l'll set you up
in a room with some fluids and a Valium.

19:40.264 --> 19:42.516
- Elliot, thank you.
- There you are.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.686
Elliot, you're coming, right?

19:45.769 --> 19:48.981
- ln a sec.
- Are you all right?

19:49.106 --> 19:51.733
<i>It's funny how our perceptions
can be so off.</i>

19:51.817 --> 19:53.652
Hot cocoa, sweetie?

19:54.403 --> 19:56.071
Thanks.

19:56.822 --> 19:58.282
Anytime.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.993
<i>Like when you're searching
for a place to fit in</i>

20:01.076 --> 20:04.538
<i>and you don't realise you've
been there the whole time.</i>

20:07.791 --> 20:12.421
<i>Or how posters can't turn you into a
role model if you've been one for years.</i>

20:16.133 --> 20:20.220
<i>Of course, in my case,
I knew exactly where I stood.</i>

20:20.304 --> 20:22.347
<i>And it didn't feel that good.</i>

20:22.431 --> 20:26.435
l would like to make
special mention of one intern here,

20:26.518 --> 20:28.145
John Dorian.

20:28.228 --> 20:31.815
Smart kid, extremely competent,
and his enthusiasm

20:31.899 --> 20:34.276
and his determination
to always be better

20:34.359 --> 20:37.696
is something l see in him
24 hours a day.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.616
He cares. Probably cares too much.

20:40.699 --> 20:44.161
But he's definitely somebody
you don't want to lose.

20:44.244 --> 20:47.831
lf you have any questions...
l could give a crap, l'm goin' home.

20:47.915 --> 20:50.792
You all get paid too much
for doing nothing.

20:50.876 --> 20:54.087
Oh, good, Newbie. You found a specialty.

20:54.171 --> 20:56.632
No, l just dropped my pen.

20:56.715 --> 21:00.594
Well, look what magically
found its way back home.

21:00.677 --> 21:03.013
What? Your window cleaner?

21:03.096 --> 21:05.557
No. Ammonia.

21:05.641 --> 21:08.602
This is window cleaner, right...

21:14.316 --> 21:15.817
Why?

21:16.860 --> 21:18.529
<i>Now that's just bad luck.</i>
